<i>Previously on</i> Roswell, New Mexico...

00:01.734 --> 00:03.797
Before my dad died, he
wrote me these letters.

00:03.822 --> 00:05.322
Some of the symbols in these letters

00:05.346 --> 00:06.984
match the symbols on this glass.

00:07.663 --> 00:09.897
Does the name Caulfield
mean anything to you?

00:09.922 --> 00:11.911
It's a prison a hundred
miles north of here.

00:11.936 --> 00:13.598
It's been shut down for decades.

00:13.623 --> 00:15.309
I think there's a fourth alien.

00:15.334 --> 00:16.795
And I think maybe your sister

00:16.820 --> 00:18.102
<i>is innocent of all of this.</i>

00:18.127 --> 00:20.171
What if the fourth alien can...

00:20.196 --> 00:22.149
<i>Get in people's mind
when they're blacked out</i>

00:22.174 --> 00:24.375
<i>and convince them to commit murder.</i>

00:25.337 --> 00:27.112
<i>Max, it's him. It's Noah.</i>

00:27.137 --> 00:28.582
Let's go home, darling.

<i>Sucks to be powerless, doesn't it?</i>

00:57.350 --> 00:59.144
<i>We were all hopeful once.</i>

00:59.236 --> 01:01.870
<i>We left behind a war-torn,
desolate planet</i>

01:01.895 --> 01:04.857
<i>in search of a better
place to call home.</i>

01:08.296 --> 01:10.739
<i>We were refugees, together.</i>

01:14.149 --> 01:16.035
<i>But the ship was hijacked.</i>

01:17.018 --> 01:19.474
<i>Driven into the ground by a stowaway.</i>

01:20.293 --> 01:22.458
<i>We crashed in a foreign land,</i>

01:22.851 --> 01:25.712
<i>trading one kind of
violence for another.</i>

01:26.586 --> 01:28.560
<i>I listened all night</i>

01:28.771 --> 01:31.843
<i>as humans slaughtered our
comrades, our families.</i>

01:38.281 --> 01:39.600
<i>What is it you call them?</i>

01:40.441 --> 01:41.449
<i>Pods?</i>

01:41.891 --> 01:43.614
<i>Well, mine wasn't built like yours.</i>

01:44.930 --> 01:46.911
<i>I was traveling with the peasants.</i>

01:47.546 --> 01:49.130
<i>My pod was flimsy.</i>

01:49.428 --> 01:50.946
<i>It cracked on impact.</i>

01:51.225 --> 01:52.864
<i>It wasn't built to last.</i>

01:53.886 --> 01:55.653
<i>But it was my only option.</i>

01:57.319 --> 02:01.123
<i>I just wanted some quiet,
to silence the screaming.</i>

02:06.283 --> 02:07.683
I got to pee.

02:12.164 --> 02:14.955
Isobel's been extra annoying lately.

02:28.295 --> 02:31.694
<i>That broken pod kept
me alive, but barely.</i>

02:32.423 --> 02:35.852
<i>Turned me into some rotted,
mangled version of myself.</i>

02:36.398 --> 02:39.077
<i>No one ever came for
me until you, Isobel.</i>

02:39.689 --> 02:42.372
<i>You and I were both alone that night.</i>

02:43.009 --> 02:44.984
<i>And then, we weren't.</i>

02:54.318 --> 02:57.262
This is not healthy, Iz.

02:58.819 --> 03:02.006
What, hanging out in a cave, or
my husband violating my body

03:02.031 --> 03:04.353
to commit the first of his 14 murders?

03:05.274 --> 03:07.356
I'm just trying to process this.

03:08.447 --> 03:10.943
You know, figure out how I
never realized what he was,

03:11.445 --> 03:13.173
after all this time.

03:13.815 --> 03:15.780
Pod keeps him comfortable.

03:16.972 --> 03:18.742
I say we drag Noah out,

03:19.429 --> 03:21.744
torture some information out of him.

03:22.514 --> 03:24.456
He'll die.

03:25.527 --> 03:28.312
He's got Liz's serum
coursing through his veins.

03:28.337 --> 03:30.188
- It'll kill him outside of that thing.
- So?

03:30.213 --> 03:32.187
We'll we have Liz whip up a
fresh batch of the antidote.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.490
Let him live a long life out here

03:33.515 --> 03:34.625
where I can make him suffer.

03:34.650 --> 03:36.351
We don't have to do anything right now.

03:36.376 --> 03:39.010
It's only been three days.
Let yourself heal.

03:39.165 --> 03:40.847
When you're ready,
you'll know what to do.

03:41.056 --> 03:44.691
Doesn't matter if it's tomorrow
or ten years from now.

03:44.716 --> 03:46.506
He's not going anywhere,
and neither are we.

03:46.531 --> 03:49.981
Our whole lives, we've
wondered where we came from,

03:50.006 --> 03:52.072
what we are doing here.
I don't know, Max,

03:52.097 --> 03:54.436
- if only there was someone to ask.
- Give her time.

03:54.461 --> 03:56.446
Could you guys stop it?

03:56.837 --> 03:59.385
We're going to decide
what to do together,

03:59.410 --> 04:02.327
just... not today.

04:02.674 --> 04:04.156
- Please.
- Fine.

04:05.826 --> 04:07.531
We'll talk again tomorrow.

04:25.202 --> 04:27.068
♪ Well, I wonder what it's like... ♪

04:27.093 --> 04:29.393
Table five's Neptuna Melt is
missing Crater Tots, Niko.

04:29.418 --> 04:31.992
- All right, I'm on it.
- I see the antenna's back in play.

04:32.017 --> 04:35.402
Oh, it was the one thing missing
from my angiogenic research.

04:35.427 --> 04:37.779
Mm. You are brilliant.

04:38.429 --> 04:39.937
You'll be back in a lab in no time.

04:39.962 --> 04:42.242
More Space Jam down here, honey.

04:43.661 --> 04:45.120
I have three degrees.

04:45.711 --> 04:48.082
And Rocket Relish on your collar.

04:50.377 --> 04:52.320
Another handprint from Evans?

04:52.345 --> 04:54.338
No. I haven't seen Max in a few days.

04:54.363 --> 04:55.629
He's had family stuff.

04:55.654 --> 04:57.716
Handprint is from the fight with Noah.

04:59.007 --> 05:01.561
Can't believe Roswell's Mr.
Congeniality is the killer.

05:01.586 --> 05:04.858
Noah is basically in alien
jail forever, probably.

05:05.137 --> 05:06.078
Justice is served,

05:06.103 --> 05:07.765
and I got the answers I was
looking for with my sister,

05:07.790 --> 05:09.103
- so it's done.
- Yeah.

05:09.128 --> 05:10.728
You seem real well-adjusted.

05:11.966 --> 05:13.857
I'm working on the whole closure thing.

05:14.529 --> 05:16.046
Yeah, me, too.

05:17.187 --> 05:18.302
Listen,

05:18.327 --> 05:20.085
uh, I've got some

05:20.109 --> 05:22.578
personal stuff going on today,
but this weekend, I was thinking

05:22.603 --> 05:24.325
of visiting my dad's grave,

05:24.431 --> 05:26.535
and I'd like to pay
respects to Rosa, too.

05:26.560 --> 05:29.051
- You want to come?
- Yeah, that'd be nice.

05:29.076 --> 05:30.289
Thank you.

05:31.647 --> 05:33.080
Rosa always liked you.

05:33.679 --> 05:35.070
Mm, no, she didn't.

05:35.095 --> 05:37.796
<i>¿Hola? Yo quiero</i> some frickin' service.

05:42.824 --> 05:44.637
Isn't it a little early?

05:47.540 --> 05:49.184
Not if you've had my morning.

05:51.645 --> 05:54.155
Uh, I need your help with something.

05:54.370 --> 05:55.705
I told you a little bit
about my dad's involvement

05:55.730 --> 05:56.994
with Project Shepherd.

05:57.019 --> 05:59.069
The top secret alien-hunting op?

05:59.465 --> 06:03.155
Right. So weird how he never
had me over for Sunday dinner.

06:03.875 --> 06:06.809
Technically, it was established
to cover up the UFO

06:06.870 --> 06:08.608
and any subsequent activity.

06:09.289 --> 06:13.123
But, yeah, I do think there was
a more sinister element to it.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.876
- I'm listening.
- I keep finding

06:15.901 --> 06:17.648
mention of a prison named Caulfield.

06:17.862 --> 06:19.546
It shut down in the '70s,

06:19.571 --> 06:21.687
but some of the heat signatures

06:21.712 --> 06:22.983
that we've detected are inconsistent

06:23.008 --> 06:24.927
with human body temperature.

06:26.363 --> 06:27.531
Aliens.

06:27.874 --> 06:29.224
Potentially.

06:29.449 --> 06:30.534
We won't know

06:30.559 --> 06:33.226
until we see for ourselves, but maybe.

06:34.960 --> 06:36.565
You do run hot, Guerin.

06:37.998 --> 06:39.387
There's no way.

06:39.412 --> 06:41.671
There's just, there's no way

06:41.696 --> 06:42.858
other aliens survived.

06:43.077 --> 06:44.239
We'd have known.

06:44.757 --> 06:46.533
Then what's the harm in a road trip?

06:47.756 --> 06:49.911
There, uh, there is one catch.

06:53.324 --> 06:54.874
Who's driving?

06:57.506 --> 06:58.879
You know, while you were in stasis,

06:58.904 --> 07:00.797
I damn near hibernated here.

07:01.760 --> 07:05.624
I'd tell you about my day, read to you.

07:05.649 --> 07:07.750
I didn't hear any of that, Max.

07:10.321 --> 07:12.264
Time stands still in there.

07:14.078 --> 07:16.479
He doesn't deserve the sound
of your voice ever again.

07:17.857 --> 07:19.690
It's not about him hearing it.

07:19.715 --> 07:23.235
Just might feel good to
get it off your chest.

07:25.031 --> 07:26.798
I'm-a, I'm gonna wait in the car.

07:26.823 --> 07:28.905
I want to get you home
before the storm comes in,

07:28.930 --> 07:31.869
but I'll give you some time.

07:49.804 --> 07:51.614
Cosmic Cakes and Crashbrowns.

07:51.639 --> 07:54.017
Thank you. Wow.

08:14.083 --> 08:16.072
Max?

08:21.176 --> 08:22.837
How is it possible?

08:25.884 --> 08:27.837
- No.
- Well, is he making you do this?

08:27.862 --> 08:29.860
No. He has Liz's serum in him.

08:29.885 --> 08:31.594
He can't control me. It's me.

08:31.619 --> 08:33.572
Don't kill him. We need answers.

08:36.822 --> 08:38.288
You're just in time.

08:38.313 --> 08:40.313
Noah here is about to start talking.

08:40.339 --> 08:42.524
Now, you worthless piece...

08:42.549 --> 08:43.682
Max.

08:43.707 --> 08:45.859
You think we're enemies, but we're not.

08:47.550 --> 08:49.154
We were all hopeful once.

08:49.471 --> 08:50.741
We left behind

08:50.766 --> 08:52.909
a war-torn, desolate planet

08:52.934 --> 08:55.328
in search of a better
place to call home.

08:56.872 --> 08:58.336
We were refugees...

09:00.530 --> 09:02.251
together.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.415
We were both all alone that night.

09:08.915 --> 09:10.229
And then we weren't.

09:10.609 --> 09:12.511
<i>I'd been in silence so long</i>

09:13.144 --> 09:14.610
<i>and then I heard something beautiful.</i>

09:17.587 --> 09:19.008
Michael wanted to camp out at the site

09:19.033 --> 09:20.499
of the UFO crash that night.

09:20.540 --> 09:21.887
Were you lurking there?

09:21.912 --> 09:23.103
I wasn't lurking.

09:23.128 --> 09:25.295
I crawled into that pod in 1947,

09:25.320 --> 09:28.068
just to get some rest
before someone came for me.

09:28.242 --> 09:31.143
But it was defective,
broken in the crash,

09:31.173 --> 09:32.866
and I couldn't get out.

09:33.734 --> 09:35.868
I wasn't in stasis like
I should have been.

09:36.244 --> 09:37.494
I was aware

09:37.519 --> 09:39.033
of every miserable moment.

09:39.362 --> 09:41.375
Paralyzed. I weakened.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.293
I shriveled. No choice but
to wait for something

09:43.318 --> 09:45.170
I knew may never come.

09:46.440 --> 09:48.422
Isobel's psychic scream that night...

09:50.965 --> 09:52.572
was the sweetest sound.

09:52.597 --> 09:55.079
If you hadn't left her alone, I
never would've heard her voice.

09:55.104 --> 09:57.265
She was 14 years old.

09:58.584 --> 10:00.810
Max said you blacked out

10:01.038 --> 10:02.900
- after the assault.
- That's how he got in.

10:03.310 --> 10:06.299
You crawled in through
some crack in my psyche?

10:06.562 --> 10:08.443
Yes, and I stayed.

10:08.725 --> 10:10.681
Through the years, every
time you were triggered,

10:10.706 --> 10:12.272
every time you were afraid,

10:12.297 --> 10:13.930
you left your body,

10:13.955 --> 10:16.368
and gave me space to borrow it.

10:23.787 --> 10:25.334
I need air.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.467
Could you make sure she's okay?

10:33.365 --> 10:34.464
He's weak.

10:34.489 --> 10:35.424
If-if we don't do anything,

10:35.449 --> 10:37.722
I doubt he's gonna make
it through the day.

10:38.745 --> 10:40.378
Is that what you want?

10:44.039 --> 10:45.772
Be careful.

10:53.609 --> 10:55.346
When I accessed the satellite
imagery from the base,

10:55.371 --> 10:57.611
the prison had zero heat signature.

10:58.495 --> 11:01.674
They're using a really advanced
camouflage technology.

11:01.699 --> 11:04.463
- How'd you bypass it?
- Well, I'm more advanced.

11:04.669 --> 11:06.542
This storm that's rolling
in, though, is messing

11:06.567 --> 11:08.502
- with the radar now.
- Well,

11:08.527 --> 11:10.255
there's something here worth hiding.

11:10.863 --> 11:12.590
Something my dad wanted me to know,

11:12.615 --> 11:13.690
or he wouldn't have
gone to all the trouble

11:13.715 --> 11:15.174
to hide the word
"Caulfield" in his letters

11:15.199 --> 11:16.740
before he was murdered.

11:17.990 --> 11:19.312
We don't know that he was murdered.

11:19.337 --> 11:21.642
You can't give somebody a brain tumor.

11:24.406 --> 11:25.673
Wait.

11:25.945 --> 11:27.522
What's that heat signature?

11:29.212 --> 11:30.806
Just me.

11:32.455 --> 11:34.065
What do we need him for?

11:34.172 --> 11:36.556
You, uh, under the weather?
Maybe experiencing

11:36.581 --> 11:39.741
selective amnesia about the
hell this dick put you through?

11:40.176 --> 11:42.663
Look, high school's ten
years to the left.

11:43.878 --> 11:45.587
Let's focus on the shadowy

11:45.612 --> 11:47.065
government conspiracy on the right.

11:53.741 --> 11:55.197
Something's wrong in there.

11:55.290 --> 11:57.969
I thought Isobel was the
psychic and you were the Jedi.

11:58.773 --> 12:00.244
Jedis are psychic.

12:00.269 --> 12:02.140
I've never actually seen <i> Star Trek.</i>

12:02.413 --> 12:03.526
Oh, my God.

12:03.551 --> 12:06.902
I'm not psychic, but I pick
up on Max and Iz sometimes.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.779
When things are really bad

12:08.804 --> 12:10.570
for one of us, the others
get flashes of pain.

12:10.595 --> 12:12.148
You got one of those flashes now?

12:12.173 --> 12:13.242
No.

12:13.860 --> 12:15.390
It's like screaming

12:16.374 --> 12:17.999
from far away.

12:27.185 --> 12:28.959
You sure you want to do this?

12:40.733 --> 12:42.109
Damn it.

12:43.219 --> 12:45.143
Let's start again.

12:46.217 --> 12:47.351
Where are we from?

12:47.411 --> 12:48.686
You don't know?

12:49.487 --> 12:51.856
You got a map tattooed on your shoulder.

12:52.385 --> 12:53.774
Is that what that is?

12:54.174 --> 12:56.736
What does it mean? How do I read it?

12:58.943 --> 13:00.142
You know...

13:01.625 --> 13:03.869
On second thought, I
don't mind the pain.

13:04.104 --> 13:05.996
Reminds me I'm alive.

13:06.318 --> 13:07.717
Plus, if I'm gonna die,

13:07.742 --> 13:10.375
might as well do it watching
you twist in the wind.

13:15.588 --> 13:18.483
Anyway, there's not much time, so...

13:18.508 --> 13:20.093
You better get here soon,

13:20.577 --> 13:22.594
if you want to ask your questions.

13:26.316 --> 13:27.838
Michael's not picking up.

13:27.975 --> 13:30.108
- I'm sure he's okay.
- Yeah, of course he's fine.

13:30.133 --> 13:32.760
The villain is slowly dying
on my brother's couch.

13:33.180 --> 13:34.713
It's okay to grieve.

13:35.465 --> 13:36.467
It's okay to miss

13:36.492 --> 13:38.402
the version of him that you loved.

13:39.039 --> 13:40.986
What great disappointment of yours

13:41.011 --> 13:43.282
do you want me to relate
to right now, Liz?

13:44.576 --> 13:46.087
Your mother who was never there

13:46.112 --> 13:48.335
to cut the crusts off your sandwiches?

13:48.753 --> 13:51.666
Or Rosa who didn't have
it all figured out at 19?

13:54.975 --> 13:58.084
I won't pretend I know
what you're going through.

13:58.786 --> 13:59.786
I mean,

13:59.811 --> 14:01.627
you were violated in a way that's...

14:03.693 --> 14:05.095
unimaginable.

14:08.429 --> 14:10.030
It doesn't matter

14:10.285 --> 14:11.796
what Michael needs to know from him,

14:11.821 --> 14:14.648
and it doesn't matter how angry Max is.

14:15.321 --> 14:16.649
What do you need?

14:22.208 --> 14:24.364
I've never lost someone that I loved.

14:29.466 --> 14:32.289
Was there anything that
made you feel better

14:32.683 --> 14:34.374
about Rosa?

14:42.164 --> 14:43.770
The truth helped.

14:50.690 --> 14:52.283
I feel them.

14:53.486 --> 14:55.312
Come on, this way.

15:16.037 --> 15:17.513
Why can't you Magneto your
way through this one?

15:17.538 --> 15:19.560
I don't know.

15:21.932 --> 15:23.549
Wait, someone's coming.

15:27.706 --> 15:28.972
I'll take care of this.

15:28.997 --> 15:30.473
- Head towards the entrance.
- No.

15:30.733 --> 15:31.933
Go.

15:36.130 --> 15:37.729
Don't move.

15:47.354 --> 15:49.324
I didn't think you'd have it in you.

15:49.349 --> 15:50.910
It's been a long time, Flint.

15:54.273 --> 15:55.688
Good to see you.

16:00.649 --> 16:02.255
<i>Why are you here, Alex?</i>

16:02.280 --> 16:06.004
Uh, Dad sent me to fortify the
digital security measures.

16:06.408 --> 16:08.600
Aren't you on desk duty in Roswell?

16:08.625 --> 16:10.024
Like you're stationed in Munich?

16:10.082 --> 16:11.782
- Mm.
- You're able-bodied,

16:11.807 --> 16:13.599
of sound mind. Why are you in this hole

16:13.624 --> 16:15.778
instead of out there basking
in the glory you deserve?

16:15.803 --> 16:16.810
You know, it's not a hole.

16:16.855 --> 16:18.520
See, you wouldn't believe the
scientific breakthroughs

16:18.545 --> 16:20.313
we've hatched in this facility:

16:20.338 --> 16:22.027
SR-71, nanotech.

16:22.052 --> 16:23.818
Ever since the, uh...

16:24.507 --> 16:26.320
'47 UFO crash?

16:27.300 --> 16:30.115
Like I said, Dad told
me the family secret.

16:34.878 --> 16:36.378
You're not a scientist.

16:36.442 --> 16:38.415
You're a Special Forces
Weapons Sergeant.

16:38.868 --> 16:40.374
What are you doing here?

16:40.794 --> 16:44.263
Dad brought me in five years ago.
He wanted to build a wall

16:44.288 --> 16:45.855
against an impending alien invasion.

16:46.047 --> 16:47.691
Wh... That doesn't look like a wall.

16:47.716 --> 16:49.455
That looks like a thermobaric ordnance.

16:49.480 --> 16:50.495
It's a smart bomb.

16:50.520 --> 16:52.801
- Oh, will it feed my beagle?
- We're in beta.

16:52.826 --> 16:54.926
Once perfected, it'll
be innocuous to humans,

16:54.951 --> 16:57.402
designed to kill aliens using
their DNA against them.

16:57.628 --> 16:59.879
Bioweapons are banned by
international treaty.

16:59.904 --> 17:02.334
The U.N.'s jurisdiction
ends at the ozone layer.

17:02.359 --> 17:04.233
The jurisdiction on genocide?

17:04.258 --> 17:06.359
Genocide is the aliens' intent for us

17:06.385 --> 17:07.574
during a systematic invasion.

17:07.598 --> 17:09.222
They're perfectly designed to kill.

17:09.771 --> 17:10.864
It's coming.

17:10.888 --> 17:12.784
The question is whether
or not we'll be ready.

17:13.652 --> 17:15.201
I see that you're just as committed

17:15.226 --> 17:16.746
to the cause as our old man.

17:17.952 --> 17:19.957
Dad didn't send you, did he?

17:21.221 --> 17:23.833
No, Dad would never send you.

17:30.619 --> 17:32.219
I need a private moment with him.

17:32.244 --> 17:33.709
- No.
- Max.

17:33.734 --> 17:36.432
- No.
- I wasn't asking.

17:52.510 --> 17:53.809
Finally.

17:54.682 --> 17:56.193
Thank you.

17:56.489 --> 17:57.954
You need to listen, my love...

17:57.979 --> 18:01.248
Don't... use that word.

18:03.810 --> 18:05.461
I need to snap her out of this.

18:05.486 --> 18:07.380
He can't hurt her physically.

18:07.405 --> 18:08.548
Her mindscape is the only place

18:08.573 --> 18:09.969
where she has total control.

18:09.994 --> 18:12.649
I think she needs that right now.

18:13.548 --> 18:17.056
I appreciate your concern, but
you don't know Isobel like I do.

18:17.787 --> 18:20.684
And you don't know how it
feels to lose someone.

18:22.228 --> 18:24.396
She had a life with him.

18:25.347 --> 18:26.862
She felt loved.

18:26.887 --> 18:28.469
She had a partner.

18:28.494 --> 18:31.001
A bunch of secrets and lies
just stole that from her.

18:31.026 --> 18:33.423
Are you sympathizing with
the man who debased Isobel?

18:33.448 --> 18:35.198
- Who killed Rosa?
- I am not.

18:35.223 --> 18:38.452
Noah is a vile sociopath
who murdered my sister

18:38.507 --> 18:40.580
because he felt entitled to her.

18:41.284 --> 18:42.748
I hate him.

18:44.885 --> 18:45.891
But he...

18:45.916 --> 18:48.211
Please do not finish that sentence.

18:52.181 --> 18:53.481
He left this mark on me

18:53.506 --> 18:56.053
the night of the gala
when he tried to kill me.

18:58.367 --> 19:00.086
I need to know why.

19:01.351 --> 19:03.019
I was barely alive,

19:03.044 --> 19:05.055
physically, but my mind was sharp.

19:05.080 --> 19:07.014
That's what made the
decades so agonizing.

19:07.039 --> 19:08.672
Then I had the chance

19:08.697 --> 19:10.818
to see this world where we landed

19:11.262 --> 19:12.652
through your eyes,

19:12.677 --> 19:14.029
your beautiful eyes.

19:14.054 --> 19:16.821
You used me like a sock puppet

19:16.846 --> 19:18.312
to prey on a lost

19:18.337 --> 19:19.375
teenage girl.

19:19.400 --> 19:22.646
Rosa... wasn't prey.

19:24.953 --> 19:27.918
Tell that to the headstone at
the Frontier Valley Cemetery,

19:27.943 --> 19:29.476
- Noah.
- She couldn't be trusted.

19:29.501 --> 19:31.180
Don't blame her.

19:31.205 --> 19:32.589
You faltered.

19:32.945 --> 19:35.214
You were the one who dropped
your harmless facade when she

19:35.239 --> 19:38.595
caught a glimpse of your truth.
She was too smart to love you.

19:39.637 --> 19:41.224
And she died for it.

19:41.249 --> 19:45.351
Me? I... I believed your lies.

19:46.296 --> 19:47.929
Lucky me.

19:48.138 --> 19:50.656
I didn't want to tell you, I-I
thought it would bother you.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.173
Bother me? He marked you!

19:52.198 --> 19:54.251
Max, I feel him now.

19:57.609 --> 19:59.199
I feel his fear.

19:59.438 --> 20:01.462
He's afraid to die.

20:01.487 --> 20:03.735
My serum is right now
killing a living thing

20:03.760 --> 20:05.649
that is capable of fear.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.532
I haven't slept in days.

20:07.557 --> 20:10.906
I-I created a makeshift lab.
I made more of the antidote.

20:10.931 --> 20:14.131
Not because I want him to live.

20:15.940 --> 20:18.844
Because I don't want to be a killer.

20:26.293 --> 20:27.469
What's happening?

20:27.494 --> 20:29.558
Your body's been deteriorating.

20:29.583 --> 20:31.321
And your mind is starting to go, too.

20:31.346 --> 20:33.938
You don't want to watch me die.
I can tell you

20:33.963 --> 20:36.656
where the antidote is.
You can bring it to me.

20:36.681 --> 20:38.721
We can go back to how
things were before.

20:38.746 --> 20:41.190
How things were when we
were both pretending

20:41.215 --> 20:43.326
- to be human?
- Yes!

20:44.756 --> 20:46.746
We were good at it.

20:48.223 --> 20:50.500
We could do it again.

20:52.249 --> 20:53.923
Pretend this all away.

21:01.496 --> 21:04.473
Hey, hey, are you okay?

21:04.522 --> 21:05.891
No.

21:06.925 --> 21:08.811
I don't want to do this alone.

21:09.556 --> 21:11.356
Okay.

21:11.503 --> 21:13.733
Are we just following alien radar?

21:13.937 --> 21:15.503
Feel free to leave me alone.

21:15.680 --> 21:19.185
Hey! Your ship crashed
into my family in '47.

21:19.689 --> 21:21.131
My father's dead, and I
think the reason for it

21:21.156 --> 21:23.032
is somewhere inside these walls.

21:23.865 --> 21:25.828
You're not the only one
who wants answers.

21:33.690 --> 21:36.129
Alex and I decoded my dad's letters.

21:36.980 --> 21:38.859
Look. This repeats.

21:38.884 --> 21:40.926
7A-N38.

21:43.540 --> 21:46.256
Alex and you, huh?

21:46.966 --> 21:50.351
Well... after you.

21:52.042 --> 21:53.975
Why are you really here, Alex?

21:54.000 --> 21:56.762
Tying up loose ends before
my honorable discharge.

21:56.787 --> 21:59.472
You ever get tired of being the
black sheep of the family?

21:59.497 --> 22:01.198
Do you ever get tired
of following the flock?

22:01.223 --> 22:03.790
I know it wasn't easy for
you growing up with Dad,

22:03.815 --> 22:05.902
but I tried my best to
protect you from him.

22:05.927 --> 22:07.494
Oh, spare me.

22:08.057 --> 22:10.191
Don't worry, I won't tell
him that you let me in.

22:10.216 --> 22:11.915
Look, you don't get it.

22:11.940 --> 22:13.373
You should have stayed away.

22:13.398 --> 22:16.402
I'm sorry, but you're not leaving here.

22:29.388 --> 22:31.351
Holy...

22:38.734 --> 22:40.569
He's an alien.

22:50.250 --> 22:51.829
They all are.

22:52.748 --> 22:54.250
I can feel them.

22:55.221 --> 22:56.668
They're angry.

22:56.927 --> 22:59.046
Confused, frightened.

22:59.798 --> 23:03.132
If they're survivors
of the 1947 crash...

23:03.990 --> 23:06.358
they've been in captivity for 71 years.

23:06.383 --> 23:08.472
Will you just shut up, Valenti?!

23:09.205 --> 23:11.444
These people, they're like me.

23:16.725 --> 23:19.233
Their bodies are covered in bruises,

23:19.258 --> 23:22.694
scarring, needle tracks.

23:23.519 --> 23:25.072
Antisocial behavior

23:25.097 --> 23:26.974
indicates prolonged trauma.

23:26.999 --> 23:29.354
Seven decades of torture.

23:32.403 --> 23:34.401
We got to get them out of here.

23:34.537 --> 23:36.115
Bring them where?

23:36.297 --> 23:37.710
They're feral.

23:45.673 --> 23:48.594
My dad wanted me to find Subject N-38.

23:48.959 --> 23:50.764
It's all over the letters.

23:52.453 --> 23:53.748
Hey.

23:55.484 --> 23:56.604
Guerin.

24:08.056 --> 24:09.507
Oh, no.

24:09.990 --> 24:11.660
Oh, I know her.

24:18.803 --> 24:21.711
I-I know, I know, I know her.

24:22.388 --> 24:23.965
Are you sure?

24:26.859 --> 24:29.344
Someone's coming. Go. Go, go.

24:33.666 --> 24:34.832
Who are you?

24:34.857 --> 24:36.371
The new lab tech.

24:36.396 --> 24:38.102
I need to get in and collect a sample

24:38.127 --> 24:40.558
- for Subject N-38.
- You've got to be mistaken.

24:40.583 --> 24:43.574
There's been a strict ban on any
interaction with Subject N-38

24:43.599 --> 24:45.465
- since 1962.
- Sorry.

24:45.490 --> 24:48.481
Um, must've been a mix-up.

24:50.199 --> 24:51.486
He looks...

24:51.511 --> 24:54.067
- harmless.
- Looks can be deceiving.

24:54.347 --> 24:57.183
They used to send lab rats in there.
Rabbits.

24:57.324 --> 24:59.417
- They'd all die.
- What'd he do?

24:59.442 --> 25:01.223
Eat them? No.

25:01.357 --> 25:04.171
Everything it touches dies
of violent, rapid cancer.

25:04.949 --> 25:07.424
It could give a tumor to a brick wall.

25:09.245 --> 25:11.478
Any human ever go in there?

25:11.930 --> 25:13.431
Once.

25:41.486 --> 25:44.392
Well, I didn't think this awful
ménage à trois was inevitable,

25:45.048 --> 25:46.079
but...

25:46.104 --> 25:47.730
I can make your slow and painful death

25:47.755 --> 25:49.554
more slow and more painful.

25:49.579 --> 25:51.259
You'd like to kill me, wouldn't you?

25:52.373 --> 25:53.596
You're hungry for it.

25:53.621 --> 25:55.025
Come on, Maximo, you can't

25:55.218 --> 25:56.640
lie in here.

25:57.036 --> 25:58.806
What's he talking about, Max?

25:58.831 --> 26:00.939
I'm sure you're wondering
why I stopped borrowing

26:00.964 --> 26:02.497
your body after Rosa died.

26:02.522 --> 26:05.357
How I healed, how I got
out of that pod, finally.

26:06.689 --> 26:10.134
I didn't want to kill Rosa,
but there's the cruel irony:

26:10.159 --> 26:11.478
killing her,

26:11.503 --> 26:13.782
channeling her exquisite life force,

26:14.331 --> 26:15.697
it brought me back.

26:15.835 --> 26:18.303
I changed shape and my mind sharpened.

26:18.387 --> 26:20.830
Kills make us stronger, don't they, Max?

26:22.591 --> 26:25.130
Destruction makes us feel better.

26:25.155 --> 26:26.755
Physically, at least.

26:26.780 --> 26:28.630
That's why the bodies piled up.

26:29.450 --> 26:31.650
You keep killing because
it keeps you strong.

26:31.675 --> 26:33.902
That's why your powers are
so much stronger than ours.

26:33.927 --> 26:35.803
It's simple practice.

26:36.645 --> 26:40.309
You could be strong if you
weren't so afraid of yourself.

26:41.017 --> 26:43.813
I kill to keep my body alive.

26:43.838 --> 26:45.720
After all those years
in that broken pod,

26:45.745 --> 26:48.025
it wants to disintegrate,
and I won't let it.

26:48.050 --> 26:51.153
- You're a parasite.
- And you're an aberration.

26:52.297 --> 26:54.620
When you heal people,
it nearly kills you

26:54.645 --> 26:56.579
because it's unnatural,
downright freakish,

26:56.604 --> 27:00.126
but hell if you didn't feel
like a force of nature

27:00.151 --> 27:01.423
after you killed the creep

27:01.448 --> 27:03.122
in the desert that night.

27:03.536 --> 27:06.543
You felt like a god.

27:08.668 --> 27:11.131
You got a tiny taste again
this year, didn't you,

27:11.156 --> 27:13.258
blowing out all the power in town?

27:13.719 --> 27:16.387
Destruction is chaos

27:16.412 --> 27:19.056
is entropy is energy

27:19.730 --> 27:22.602
is power is victory.

27:25.118 --> 27:26.556
You would not be hiding here

27:26.581 --> 27:28.232
unless you had something to hide from.

27:30.147 --> 27:31.693
That's Dad's way.

27:32.171 --> 27:33.904
Blackmail people into obedience.

27:33.929 --> 27:35.696
Manipulate them, exploit them.

27:35.721 --> 27:37.308
Do not talk to me about orders.

27:37.333 --> 27:39.618
- What does he have on you?
- Alex.

27:39.743 --> 27:41.531
You brought Kyle Valenti with you.

27:41.556 --> 27:42.689
Think I figured it out.

27:42.714 --> 27:44.789
Look, this place is a nightmare.

27:44.986 --> 27:48.542
Guantanamo for innocent people,
and our fathers facilitated it.

27:48.567 --> 27:50.567
Aliens have been tortured
here for decades.

27:50.592 --> 27:53.064
They told you about Subject N-38.

27:53.254 --> 27:54.608
Don't tell me there's a

27:54.633 --> 27:56.399
alien that can cause a brain tumor.

27:56.424 --> 27:58.806
They're all killers.
Makes them stronger.

27:58.831 --> 28:00.764
We have the research to prove it.

28:01.183 --> 28:03.266
My dad participated in that research?

28:03.291 --> 28:05.102
Kept aliens isolated?

28:05.415 --> 28:07.354
Starved, dissected?

28:08.962 --> 28:10.673
Then he deserved it.

28:14.421 --> 28:17.127
If killing makes you
strong, why not kill me?

28:17.152 --> 28:18.751
Why not steal my life force?

28:19.477 --> 28:22.353
Was it not exquisite enough for you?

28:22.378 --> 28:24.496
I need you, Isobel.

28:25.345 --> 28:26.404
I still do.

28:26.429 --> 28:27.736
Stop lying.

28:27.761 --> 28:29.470
He can't lie to us in here.

28:29.751 --> 28:31.294
What do you need her for, Noah?

28:31.319 --> 28:32.962
I need all of you.

28:34.245 --> 28:35.633
For leverage.

28:35.956 --> 28:37.389
For what?

28:37.414 --> 28:39.048
Why were we in the upper
class and you weren't?

28:39.073 --> 28:41.039
Why were we protected in the crash?

28:45.242 --> 28:46.877
If you want to know the truth,

28:46.902 --> 28:48.936
give me the antidote.

28:48.961 --> 28:50.660
I'll tell you everything
you want to know.

28:50.685 --> 28:52.857
Where we come from, why we came here,

28:53.225 --> 28:55.276
who you really are.

28:55.301 --> 28:56.862
We're not fools.

28:56.887 --> 28:58.781
He can't lie in here.

29:02.748 --> 29:04.661
He means it.

29:09.833 --> 29:11.970
He wants the antidote in
exchange for answers.

29:11.995 --> 29:13.832
- He'll have his powers back.
- Don't worry.

29:14.075 --> 29:15.464
I don't want them.

29:16.595 --> 29:18.550
And the truth didn't make
anything better for me.

29:19.966 --> 29:21.607
I just want to go home.

29:25.425 --> 29:26.891
Call me when he's dead.

29:32.198 --> 29:33.899
I'll drive her home.

29:35.263 --> 29:36.949
Liz, give me the antidote

29:36.974 --> 29:38.286
before you go.

29:39.788 --> 29:42.324
I'm serious. If I'm the
one holding the cure,

29:42.349 --> 29:44.283
then I'm the one refusing to use it.

29:44.308 --> 29:47.495
I'm the killer, not you.

29:47.849 --> 29:49.914
- I'm not gonna put that on...
- Trust me.

29:49.939 --> 29:51.809
I won't lose any sleep.

30:06.758 --> 30:08.642
Come on.

30:13.405 --> 30:16.775
I know you. Why? Why do I know you?

30:22.593 --> 30:24.282
I'm gonna do it the old-fashioned way.

30:43.248 --> 30:44.758
What the hell?

30:45.141 --> 30:46.492
Quarantine breach.

30:46.517 --> 30:47.884
We have ten minutes to get out of this

30:47.909 --> 30:49.179
building before it turns to dust.

30:49.204 --> 30:50.673
That would be your cue to leave.

30:50.698 --> 30:52.454
Initiating quarantine protocol.

30:52.479 --> 30:55.229
You have ten minutes to
evacuate the premises.

30:57.037 --> 30:59.212
Look, just grab everything
that you can, okay?

30:59.237 --> 31:00.428
Hard drives, anything,

31:00.452 --> 31:02.423
- but make sure that you get out.
- Okay.

31:02.448 --> 31:02.939
Okay?

31:02.964 --> 31:04.226
Okay, but Michael's in a holding area.

31:04.251 --> 31:06.185
Down the hall, to the left,
you'll see the staircase.

31:06.210 --> 31:08.142
- 7A.
- Okay.

31:14.220 --> 31:15.959
Thank you for bringing this stuff over.

31:16.147 --> 31:18.838
The extra cuffs are overkill,
but I can't be too careful.

31:19.025 --> 31:21.673
Yeah. Sure.

31:23.363 --> 31:24.843
Yeah, sure?

31:24.868 --> 31:27.262
No wildly inappropriate aside about

31:27.287 --> 31:31.180
stealing police-issued
restraints for personal use?

31:31.340 --> 31:33.047
Who are you and what have
you done with my partner?

31:33.072 --> 31:35.860
There is a serial killer
in your bedroom, Max.

31:36.187 --> 31:39.440
This isn't order. This isn't justice.

31:39.598 --> 31:41.567
And you shouldn't be
handling this on your own.

31:41.592 --> 31:44.025
I would love to turn him
in to a greater authority,

31:44.050 --> 31:45.316
but then I risk exposure,

31:45.341 --> 31:47.157
and who's to say they
could even hold him?

31:47.564 --> 31:49.284
There has to be a better way.

31:50.183 --> 31:52.161
Oh, it's too late now.

31:52.800 --> 31:55.313
W... Aren't you on duty?

31:55.338 --> 31:57.606
Why are you in civvies?

32:00.699 --> 32:03.088
I'm permanently off duty.

32:04.135 --> 32:08.329
In the melee after the gala, I
discharged my service weapon.

32:08.681 --> 32:11.681
Small town. People notice gunshots.

32:11.926 --> 32:15.750
And I couldn't exactly tell
Valenti I was rescuing you

32:15.775 --> 32:18.218
from a body-snatching alien

32:18.243 --> 32:19.842
who was wearing your sister, so...

32:19.867 --> 32:21.467
Okay. Then we'll just figure
out your cover story.

32:21.492 --> 32:23.212
I gave her a cover story.

32:23.628 --> 32:27.113
I told her that I had a little
bit too much champagne,

32:27.138 --> 32:28.949
and that I was showing off.

32:29.138 --> 32:30.563
Honestly, it was

32:30.707 --> 32:32.201
right on brand.

32:32.918 --> 32:34.084
No.

32:34.183 --> 32:36.626
No. I should be the one to
take the fall for that.

32:36.651 --> 32:37.851
Why would you do that?

32:38.368 --> 32:39.960
You know why.

32:46.827 --> 32:49.301
I am sorry I led you on. You didn't.

32:51.411 --> 32:53.014
You were clear.

32:58.909 --> 33:02.274
My sister's been transferred
to a prison in Ohio.

33:03.086 --> 33:05.782
And I want to be closer to her. So...

33:05.807 --> 33:08.407
- Yeah.
- I'm leaving Roswell.

33:08.708 --> 33:10.991
This is the last thing I do for you.

33:11.544 --> 33:13.077
It has to be.

33:13.347 --> 33:14.682
Copy that.

33:20.971 --> 33:23.503
You've been a good partner, Evans.

33:27.198 --> 33:29.166
You've been a good friend, Cam.

33:41.204 --> 33:43.371
Guerin!

33:43.396 --> 33:45.263
Guerin! Come on, we have to go!

33:45.288 --> 33:46.814
I have to get through!

33:46.839 --> 33:48.329
The alarm is not a suggestion!

33:48.354 --> 33:50.032
Okay? Nothing gets out alive.

33:50.057 --> 33:51.572
They're my family, Alex!

33:51.597 --> 33:53.950
Initiating quarantine protocol.

33:53.975 --> 33:55.537
You have two minutes to evacuate.

33:55.562 --> 33:57.412
All right, maybe.

33:58.012 --> 34:00.039
But you are mine!

34:00.919 --> 34:03.542
What? No!

34:04.675 --> 34:08.797
- You got to go, Alex.
- I don't look away, Guerin.

34:10.159 --> 34:11.811
No.

34:12.793 --> 34:14.219
Go!

34:14.244 --> 34:16.257
Go! I don't love you!

34:16.283 --> 34:17.973
I don't!

34:18.099 --> 34:20.391
We've been holding onto this thing!

34:20.428 --> 34:21.844
And what?

34:22.426 --> 34:24.606
It's gotten us nowhere.

34:25.163 --> 34:26.942
Just let go.

34:30.188 --> 34:31.835
You're a miserable liar.

35:18.379 --> 35:21.895
Initiating quarantine protocol.
You have one minute

35:21.920 --> 35:23.419
to evacuate the premises.

35:23.444 --> 35:24.958
She's my m...

35:25.416 --> 35:26.792
she's my m...

35:27.205 --> 35:28.918
Your mother?

35:31.144 --> 35:32.684
- Did she speak?
- No.

35:32.709 --> 35:34.512
- Did she say anything?
- No.

35:34.925 --> 35:37.178
No, but she said...

35:37.820 --> 35:39.930
she said she loves me.

35:41.842 --> 35:43.935
And then she said to run.

36:10.270 --> 36:11.900
Get down.

36:46.078 --> 36:47.623
Hey, Maximo.

36:48.222 --> 36:50.294
Want to grab a brewski?

36:58.689 --> 37:01.429
You were right earlier, you know.

37:02.404 --> 37:05.010
All day I've been telling Isobel

37:05.035 --> 37:07.530
that it's her call what we do with you.

37:07.555 --> 37:09.938
That I'd back her play.

37:12.498 --> 37:14.735
But I want you dead.

37:16.279 --> 37:18.379
And I want to be the one to do it.

37:18.404 --> 37:20.197
Is this about the possession

37:20.451 --> 37:23.118
or the kills or the mark

37:23.143 --> 37:25.537
I left on your girl?

37:29.029 --> 37:31.163
I knew that would make you crazy.

37:31.188 --> 37:32.187
All your books.

37:32.212 --> 37:33.781
The stories you write.

37:33.820 --> 37:37.382
Humans spend their lives looking
for meaning, but they have none.

37:37.407 --> 37:38.967
We have a purpose,

37:39.383 --> 37:41.177
you and me.

37:41.673 --> 37:43.539
And if you let me die,

37:43.821 --> 37:46.154
you'll spend the rest of your
life on this dumb planet

37:46.417 --> 37:48.184
never knowing what it is.

37:55.769 --> 37:57.527
I got this far.

37:58.628 --> 38:00.039
Think I'm better off

38:00.064 --> 38:01.864
being just a guy from Roswell.

38:13.022 --> 38:15.294
What if there's some truth to it?

38:16.333 --> 38:18.256
That the aliens are killers?

38:18.486 --> 38:19.757
Michael's a good person.

38:19.782 --> 38:22.385
What if the good ones are
the exception to the rule?

38:24.260 --> 38:26.348
Powers they have aren't exactly
benign, and I think that...

38:26.373 --> 38:28.207
You just watched your government

38:28.304 --> 38:30.934
blow up a building full
of elderly people.

38:31.843 --> 38:35.273
Your brain is trying to justify
the slaughter so that...

38:36.108 --> 38:38.112
so that your government can be right.

38:38.137 --> 38:39.976
You want to believe that we're safe.

38:40.977 --> 38:42.697
That goodness prevails.

38:42.994 --> 38:45.491
That's the coldest reality about war.

38:45.724 --> 38:48.057
Sometimes you're just
doing what you're told.

38:49.499 --> 38:51.748
Then all of a sudden,
things are burning.

38:52.077 --> 38:54.010
People are screaming.

38:57.616 --> 39:00.006
And then you look around,
and you realize...

39:01.177 --> 39:03.177
that the evil is you.

39:11.398 --> 39:13.019
Any last words?

39:13.044 --> 39:15.535
Some people like to
repent before they die.

39:15.560 --> 39:17.637
Repent?

39:18.082 --> 39:19.484
To who?

39:19.509 --> 39:20.860
God?

39:21.872 --> 39:23.416
You, Maximo?

39:26.299 --> 39:27.575
Don't.

39:27.600 --> 39:30.245
Don't leave me to die alone, Max.

39:33.461 --> 39:35.333
Then tell me where we're from.

39:37.722 --> 39:39.796
What are we doing here?

39:44.225 --> 39:46.056
You're going out the
same way you started

39:46.081 --> 39:47.512
your life on this planet.

39:47.537 --> 39:51.892
Weak, desperate and completely alone.

40:04.477 --> 40:05.533
Hey.

40:05.845 --> 40:07.574
We've been calling you all day.

40:08.182 --> 40:09.639
You look like hell.

40:09.664 --> 40:11.828
- You okay?
- Where's Noah?

40:12.213 --> 40:13.244
I, uh...

40:13.269 --> 40:15.068
I went to the cave.
He wasn't in the pod.

40:15.396 --> 40:17.797
Noah's in the back. Dying.
It's just a matter of minutes.

40:19.105 --> 40:21.963
Hey, hey. You need to talk to me.
What happened?

40:21.988 --> 40:23.408
I don't want to talk to you.

40:23.433 --> 40:24.673
I want to talk to him.

40:25.160 --> 40:27.761
We need to get him the antidote.

40:27.786 --> 40:29.304
That's not gonna happen.

40:30.167 --> 40:33.064
This is the end of Noah's
story, right now. Okay?

40:36.514 --> 40:38.897
I'm not letting another alien die.

40:42.957 --> 40:44.724
Not until I get some answers.

40:45.601 --> 40:47.363
Not until I know the truth.

40:58.771 --> 41:00.919
This is how it's gonna go, Max?

41:03.455 --> 41:06.466
That all depends on what you do next.
