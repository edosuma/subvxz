00:31.760 --> 00:34.000
Hey. Maybe you have a
second to talk now?

00:46.000 --> 00:51.160
It is brilliant.
You organized such a cool do!

00:51.240 --> 00:54.280
Nobody in London does this anymore.
Good job, Lee.

00:55.440 --> 00:56.920
Actually, the Eagles put it together.

00:57.480 --> 01:01.440
- I'm Hayley. And you?
- Hi! I'm Aspen. So nice to meet.

01:01.520 --> 01:03.640
Aspen and I pretty
much grew up together.

01:04.640 --> 01:06.760
Uh, we've known each other
since we were five, right?

01:07.360 --> 01:09.160
We're childhood sweethearts.

01:09.240 --> 01:13.200
My dad's a diplomat, and our family
moved to LA when I was in kindergarten.

01:13.280 --> 01:18.320
And it was a nightmare at first,
but then I met this guy.

01:19.040 --> 01:22.440
Do you know how many songs
he's written for me?

01:22.520 --> 01:25.200
- No. How many?
- Hundreds, maybe?

01:25.760 --> 01:31.480
Anyway, my lifelong dream was to study
singing at the London Conservatory.

01:31.560 --> 01:34.560
So we decided to have an LDR.

01:35.160 --> 01:37.680
- LDR?
- Long-distance relationship.

01:38.480 --> 01:41.400
You know what's really ironic,
is that it was me

01:41.480 --> 01:45.200
who suggested he apply to this school
in the first place. Isn't that funny?

01:46.560 --> 01:47.800
Hilarious.

02:13.160 --> 02:15.400
Please, can you just let me explain?
Uh...

02:15.480 --> 02:16.800
What's there to explain?

02:16.880 --> 02:20.200
She was in the UK
in an LDR with Lee.

02:20.280 --> 02:21.560
It's more complicated than that.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.960
Everyone, I
have milk and cookies.

02:24.480 --> 02:26.640
It's from the yummiest bakery
in Hampstead.

02:27.200 --> 02:28.880
You really didn't have to. Uh...

02:28.960 --> 02:30.600
Anything for my Lee.

02:33.520 --> 02:35.160
- Bless you.
- Oh, sorry.

02:35.240 --> 02:37.080
Okay, guys, let's take five.

02:37.160 --> 02:38.520
"Okay, guys,
let's take five."

02:38.600 --> 02:39.680
They're right here.

02:40.480 --> 02:41.800
So she's Leo's girlfriend?

02:43.440 --> 02:46.440
Hey, stop it. He's not worth it.

02:46.520 --> 02:49.760
I just don't understand how he could've
kept something like this from me.

02:49.840 --> 02:52.120
What don't you understand?
He thought he could have you both.

02:55.320 --> 02:57.240
Just when things were going perfectly...

02:57.880 --> 02:59.400
then she showed up.

02:59.960 --> 03:03.200
You should have seen the look on Leo's
face when he saw that Aspen girl.

03:05.400 --> 03:08.240
- It was like he saw a ghost.
- What a jerk.

03:10.240 --> 03:11.640
If you want,
I could go beat him up for you.

03:13.640 --> 03:15.840
Don't you think you've picked
enough fights for one night?

03:17.240 --> 03:20.720
Uh... Yeah, you may have a point there.

03:22.280 --> 03:24.840
You know, I don't need this.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.880
- I wanna go home.
- Hey.

03:31.760 --> 03:34.800
You're not going anywhere,
you hear me? Okay?

03:34.880 --> 03:36.840
Yeah.

03:50.640 --> 03:52.080
Is that Daniel's mom?

03:53.440 --> 03:55.360
Look. What is she doing over there?

03:55.440 --> 03:59.440
- Maybe she's after you.
- Oh. Very funny.

03:59.520 --> 04:02.080
You just happened to spend
the whole night with his girlfriend.

04:02.160 --> 04:04.320
Yeah.

04:06.960 --> 04:09.040
Hey, go back. Have fun.

04:10.120 --> 04:13.480
- I'm fine.
- Come on.

04:14.800 --> 04:16.279
Come on, get up.

04:16.399 --> 04:19.360
The prettiest girl at the Greenhouse
is not going to bed before ten o'clock.

04:24.480 --> 04:25.480
If you want...

04:26.480 --> 04:29.080
I can accidentally
punch him in the face.

04:38.160 --> 04:39.160
Strange.

04:45.200 --> 04:48.040
Hi, everyone.

04:48.120 --> 04:53.000
This has been such a wonderful evening
for me, and I just...

04:53.720 --> 04:56.560
I feel that I want to give
something back to all of you.

04:56.640 --> 05:02.920
I would like to sing for you this
aria by Puccini which I... so fancy.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.480
This is for a special someone who opened
my eyes up to a whole new world of music.

05:08.560 --> 05:10.520
Remember you taught me
my first guitar chord?

06:06.000 --> 06:09.040
Hi. Let me take your place.
You really should get something to eat.

06:09.120 --> 06:11.920
- It's okay. I'm good.
- No, really.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.080
I'm so full of energy.
I slept through the entire flight here.

06:15.160 --> 06:17.560
She's right, Woods.
Uh, maybe you should take a break.

06:29.960 --> 06:34.880
All right, Eagles, Ravens, it's time
for our annual Halloween dance-off!

06:37.480 --> 06:39.600
All right, you know the rules.

06:39.680 --> 06:43.280
Let's all get into a circle.
We'll take turns dancing in pairs,

06:43.360 --> 06:45.880
and the couple that gets
the loudest applause wins!

06:45.960 --> 06:47.160
Good luck!

06:54.080 --> 06:57.160
Come on, this'll be fun.
We can use your crutches as a prop.

06:57.240 --> 06:58.240
Not in the mood.

07:33.880 --> 07:35.400
Go, Max!

07:36.440 --> 07:38.040
Whoo!

07:38.120 --> 07:39.640
Yeah, Emma!

08:00.040 --> 08:02.320
Okay, guys, the time has come.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.400
You all danced beautifully tonight.

08:04.480 --> 08:06.640
But I think you can all agree
with me on this one,

08:06.720 --> 08:11.360
that the prize goes to the most...
unexpected performance of the night.

08:13.040 --> 08:17.240
Max and Emma, you're our new
king and queen! Congratulations!

08:19.440 --> 08:22.000
Ladies first.

08:28.760 --> 08:31.840
Attaboy, Max.

08:38.120 --> 08:41.240
- What is it?
- Two minutes. My office.

08:45.840 --> 08:47.760
Can you believe it? We killed.

08:47.840 --> 08:51.960
Totally. Um...
I'm gonna go freshen up.

08:52.040 --> 08:54.400
- See you in a bit, doc?
- Okeydokey.

09:01.800 --> 09:04.080
- Did you see it?
- Amazing.

09:05.360 --> 09:07.760
It's all thanks to you.
Your plan worked.

09:08.640 --> 09:11.280
- What plan?
- Getting me and Emma together.

09:17.200 --> 09:18.920
Hello.
My name is Emma Geller.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.280
I'm a student at the Greenhouse.

09:20.360 --> 09:23.560
I would like to talk to you
about what happened to your satellite.

09:26.640 --> 09:29.120
How did you get this?

09:31.280 --> 09:32.440
You tapped my Louie.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.400
Of course.

09:37.240 --> 09:41.320
I also called Brandon back on your
behalf to relay your kind message.

09:42.080 --> 09:45.400
I told him you had wanted to express
sympathy for the missing satellite.

09:46.360 --> 09:48.080
He was very moved by your concern.

09:48.680 --> 09:51.240
- I'll call him again.
- I don't think you will.

09:51.320 --> 09:52.600
I'll tell him everything.

09:53.280 --> 09:56.560
Like how you made me hack into the server,
telling me it was for a special project.

09:56.640 --> 09:59.720
How you promised me a full
college scholarship if I pulled it off.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.640
My promise still stands. Your parents are
never gonna be able to pay your tuition.

10:02.720 --> 10:05.200
My parents would rather
I won't go to college at all

10:05.280 --> 10:06.680
than accept bribes from people like you.

10:06.760 --> 10:09.800
- I'm calling NASA back.
- Fine. Go right ahead.

10:09.880 --> 10:12.480
The word of a teenager against the word
of the dean of the Greenhouse?

10:13.800 --> 10:18.600
False accusations to a government agency?
The NSA will be watching you very closely.

10:20.040 --> 10:23.040
- You're a monster.
- You leave me no choice.

10:25.840 --> 10:27.000
I can't do this anymore.

10:27.080 --> 10:29.600
And that's exactly why
you're leaving the Greenhouse.

10:32.400 --> 10:35.640
The cover story is simple.
Your mother is sick and needs you.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.600
I'm gonna tell Louis
you had to leave right away

10:37.680 --> 10:39.880
because it was a family emergency.

10:39.960 --> 10:41.640
You're gonna tell your mother
you missed home.

10:41.720 --> 10:44.560
And don't even think about saying
anything about the missing satellite,

10:44.640 --> 10:46.760
or this tape makes it
to the evening news.

10:47.600 --> 10:50.920
Get packing.
I want you out of here by tonight.

10:56.360 --> 10:59.280
Remember that time that we snuck
into the country club after midnight

10:59.360 --> 11:00.520
to dance in the ballroom?

11:02.280 --> 11:06.480
- We were 12.
- I've missed you so much, Lee.

11:15.640 --> 11:18.360
- Great party.
- Best ever.

11:21.560 --> 11:24.560
Have you ever seen that Jim Carrey
movie? You know, the artsy one?

11:25.960 --> 11:30.280
Anyway, in that movie,
there's an agency that erases memories,

11:30.360 --> 11:33.160
especially ones
that have to do with relationships.

11:33.240 --> 11:36.040
Finally, a movie I'd like to see.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.040
I wouldn't mind erasing
the past two hours.

11:58.800 --> 12:02.520
It's a slow dance.
You have no excuse this time.

12:02.600 --> 12:04.760
Not gonna happen.

12:13.360 --> 12:15.280
Fine. Have fun by yourself.

12:18.160 --> 12:20.640
- Hey.
- What's up?

12:20.720 --> 12:21.720
Not much.

12:37.480 --> 12:39.200
Can I at least say
goodbye to my friends?

12:41.920 --> 12:43.600
I don't think that's a good idea.

12:48.320 --> 12:49.320
Emma!

13:00.760 --> 13:02.680
May I have this dance?

13:03.400 --> 13:04.880
Sure.

13:14.680 --> 13:17.440
Emma, is everything okay?

13:20.520 --> 13:21.640
I have to go.

13:22.880 --> 13:24.800
Where? You just got here.

13:26.040 --> 13:29.160
Wait, is it the egg mayonnaise? I know
I should've warned you about that.

13:29.240 --> 13:30.240
Shh.

14:10.640 --> 14:12.960
Why didn't she tell me
she was leaving the Greenhouse?

14:14.800 --> 14:16.560
Maybe she didn't wanna ruin your night.

14:18.080 --> 14:20.040
She never told me her mom was sick.

14:22.200 --> 14:24.120
None of this makes any sense.

14:26.240 --> 14:29.480
She was acting weird
the past couple of weeks.

14:33.680 --> 14:36.800
Guys, you can talk later.
Let's get this over with.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.800
There's cake everywhere.

14:57.120 --> 15:00.760
Yo. What the hell do you think
you're doing, dancing with my girl?

15:00.840 --> 15:03.600
I'm not anyone's girl,
and you're making a fool of yourself.

15:04.200 --> 15:07.520
You know what? You ain't nothing
but a liar and a cheat.

15:07.600 --> 15:09.080
Hey, leave her alone.

15:10.480 --> 15:11.880
- Excuse me?
- Yeah.

15:18.600 --> 15:20.640
You and me, we're done.

15:20.720 --> 15:23.320
Oh, you took the words
right out of my mouth.

15:30.040 --> 15:32.600
Way to go, man.
That was classic.

15:40.400 --> 15:43.040
Now, that's classic.

15:43.120 --> 15:45.480
What the bloody hell is going on?

15:49.840 --> 15:53.400
Everybody, calm down!
I command you to stop!

15:53.960 --> 15:55.400
- Hey, ladies.
- Parker!

15:55.480 --> 15:57.800
No!

15:57.880 --> 15:59.360
Food fight!

16:17.040 --> 16:19.400
Ugh. What a waste of good cake.

16:21.080 --> 16:24.480
Did you ever find out about that agency
that erases bad memories?

16:24.560 --> 16:28.080
I did. But by the time they got back
to me, I told them it's not necessary,

16:28.160 --> 16:33.280
because I do not wanna erase that memory
of you shoving the cake into Aspen's face.

16:33.360 --> 16:36.560
The look on her face.

16:44.360 --> 16:46.680
Aspen, we need to talk.

16:48.320 --> 16:51.000
It's useless.

16:51.080 --> 16:53.880
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
There's a rodent in here!

16:53.960 --> 16:56.000
- Oh! Oh, my gosh!
- Hey! No!

16:56.080 --> 16:58.560
This is Steph, our rabbit.

16:58.640 --> 17:02.440
Yeah, get that fetid
creature out of here!

17:02.520 --> 17:05.079
Oh, come on. This
creature is our mascot.

17:05.160 --> 17:09.160
What? I... I don't care if it's
the Queen of England, all right? I...

17:11.480 --> 17:14.440
- I am allergic to rodents' fur.
- All right. Okay. All right.

17:14.520 --> 17:15.520
Isn't he cute?

17:15.598 --> 17:18.839
Who allowed you to have
animals in here? It is repulsive.

17:18.920 --> 17:21.200
You wanna know what's really repulsive?

17:22.079 --> 17:24.319
What Leo did to his date.

17:25.400 --> 17:26.720
Excuse me?

17:26.800 --> 17:28.840
Listen, Aspen,
what I wanted to talk to you about...

17:28.920 --> 17:30.160
It's okay.

17:30.960 --> 17:32.320
I know about Hayley.

17:33.040 --> 17:34.040
No drama.

17:34.840 --> 17:38.840
I don't care about what happened before.
I'm here now. That's all that matters.

17:39.560 --> 17:43.080
Okay. I'm really glad you're not upset.
But listen, I...

17:43.880 --> 17:47.080
I don't want to be away
from you anymore, Leo.

17:47.160 --> 17:48.200
What do you mean?

17:49.520 --> 17:51.120
Do you believe in serendipity?

17:52.640 --> 17:54.760
I just talked to Louis.

17:54.840 --> 17:59.280
It turns out one of the girls is leaving
the Greenhouse on a moment's notice.

18:00.240 --> 18:03.040
- There's a vacancy at the Ravens' house.
- Wait, what?

18:03.120 --> 18:06.320
Isn't it just the most brilliant thing
that could have ever happened?

18:11.360 --> 18:12.720
I'm so happy.

18:18.880 --> 18:19.960
You okay?

18:20.600 --> 18:22.040
I think so.

18:23.200 --> 18:24.280
What about you?

18:25.760 --> 18:26.760
Not really.

18:28.120 --> 18:31.880
I... I feel bad for Daniel.
I feel like it was all my fault.

18:33.240 --> 18:34.720
Don't blame yourself.

18:34.800 --> 18:38.920
Look, Daniel and I were growing apart
long before you came to the Greenhouse.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.560
What happened last night
was a wake-up call for me.

18:43.280 --> 18:47.360
He's too stubborn and full of pride to
take responsibility for his own actions,

18:47.440 --> 18:50.520
and I'm done cleaning up after his mess.
I'm not his mother.

18:51.200 --> 18:52.200
His mother?

18:53.160 --> 18:56.400
- What about her?
- Daniel's mother. I saw her last night.

18:57.280 --> 18:59.520
- Where?
- Right there.

19:01.080 --> 19:02.640
- Really?
- Yes.

19:02.720 --> 19:05.080
I was with Hayley. We were so busy
talking about that Aspen girl,

19:05.160 --> 19:08.680
I didn't think anything of it at first.
But, yeah, we saw her there last night.

19:08.760 --> 19:10.760
In the same spot
that I saw Marcus disappear?

19:10.840 --> 19:12.520
The same spot that we
met the park ranger?

19:12.600 --> 19:13.720
Do you think there's a connection?

19:13.800 --> 19:16.320
It all started when Daniel found
the park ranger's Taser.

19:16.400 --> 19:21.000
Okay, well... even if Judy was responsible
for getting Daniel off the hook,

19:21.080 --> 19:22.840
it still doesn't explain
why she was there.

19:23.400 --> 19:24.440
Unless...

19:25.120 --> 19:28.360
Unless she knew about the park ranger
this whole time.

19:29.760 --> 19:30.840
Wait, what do you mean?

19:32.040 --> 19:36.240
What if she wasn't protecting Daniel? What
if she was trying to protect herself?

19:38.840 --> 19:40.440
Alex, this has to be it.

19:41.600 --> 19:42.920
Do you think we should tell your dad?

19:43.560 --> 19:46.640
He adores Judy. He would never believe
that she could do anything wrong.

19:47.840 --> 19:48.880
What about your dad?

19:50.080 --> 19:52.520
He just got his job back.
I can't drag him into this.

19:55.920 --> 19:58.120
Wait. I know who we should call.

19:59.560 --> 20:02.520
- Eric? Are you sure?
- He's my dad's best friend.

20:02.600 --> 20:03.680
I know we can trust him.

20:05.080 --> 20:06.080
Okay.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.560
Thank you for believing me, Alex.

20:57.720 --> 20:59.880
Thank you for coming
on such short notice, Eric.

20:59.960 --> 21:02.240
Of course.
You know you're like a son to me, right?

21:02.320 --> 21:03.680
It's a good thing you called, though.

21:03.760 --> 21:05.240
Uh, so what now?

21:06.080 --> 21:08.320
First of all, does anyone else know
about this situation?

21:09.280 --> 21:10.240
No.

21:10.320 --> 21:12.960
Good. You both have to be very discreet
until we know more.

21:13.040 --> 21:14.560
- Of course.
- Yeah.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.760
Brooke, would you mind
coming with me to the station?

21:16.840 --> 21:17.960
We can take your deposition.

21:19.840 --> 21:21.120
- Sure. Okay.
- Yeah.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.240
And maybe we can make
a quick stop before that?

21:23.320 --> 21:24.840
Just... There's something
I think you should see.
