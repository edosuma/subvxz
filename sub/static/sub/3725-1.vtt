_

00:03.972 --> 00:07.975
1836 Republic of Texas

00:07.976 --> 00:11.611
The Mexican territory is home
to thousands of U.S. settlers.

00:13.448 --> 00:16.149
Tensions rise as Comanche and Karankawa

00:16.151 --> 00:19.453
fight to keep their lands.

00:19.454 --> 00:21.706
Outlaws roam free,

00:21.707 --> 00:25.543
and slaves are caught in the crossfire.

00:25.544 --> 00:27.161
Mexican General Santa Anna

00:27.162 --> 00:30.414
battles to reclaim the land.

00:30.415 --> 00:32.083
U.S. President Andrew Jackson

00:32.084 --> 00:34.051
is hesitant to intervene,

00:34.052 --> 00:35.635
and Texas has no choice

00:35.637 --> 00:40.174
but to declare itself
an independent nation.

00:40.175 --> 00:42.325
Outnumbered, General Sam Houston's

00:42.344 --> 00:44.011
Texas Republic Army

00:44.012 --> 00:46.496
and Steve Austin's Ranging Company

00:46.515 --> 00:49.183
are all that stand between
Santa Anna's tyranny

00:49.184 --> 00:50.684
and independence.

00:50.685 --> 00:54.087
Texas in flames; the Alamo in ashes.

00:54.089 --> 00:56.574
Pioneers, Mexicans, Tejanos,

00:56.575 --> 01:00.244
Indians, soldiers, have no choice...

01:00.245 --> 01:02.679
fight or die.

Viva Santa Anna!

02:36.291 --> 02:38.676
- Viva!
- Viva mi General!

02:42.380 --> 02:44.682
- Viva Mexico!
- Viva!

02:55.393 --> 02:57.276
Viva mi General!

03:04.953 --> 03:06.118
Vamos! Vamos!

03:16.498 --> 03:17.498
Sister...

03:36.685 --> 03:38.352
_

03:38.353 --> 03:40.688
_

03:40.689 --> 03:43.073
They are not soldiers.

03:43.074 --> 03:45.091
These men are pirates.

04:00.675 --> 04:02.376
Prepárate!

04:11.353 --> 04:12.351
Fuego!

04:16.474 --> 04:18.024
A la derecha!

04:26.451 --> 04:28.468
Portilla!

04:50.342 --> 04:52.176
Your Excellency,

04:52.177 --> 04:54.727
we find those women hiding in the crypt.

04:54.729 --> 04:57.564
Shall I take care of them also?

04:57.565 --> 04:59.566
Brother Almonte,

04:59.567 --> 05:01.935
your opinion?

05:01.936 --> 05:04.938
Let them tell their
drunken General Houston

05:04.939 --> 05:06.940
the stories of our triumph.

05:06.941 --> 05:08.541
Excellent.

05:10.111 --> 05:12.446
Ride to General Urrea's battalion,

05:12.447 --> 05:16.283
and order him to attack
Fort Goliad without delay.

05:34.969 --> 05:36.068
Oh!

07:54.115 --> 07:56.281
Got to get your rest, Sam.

07:56.283 --> 07:57.800
You're so peaked;

07:57.818 --> 08:00.219
you look like death eating a cracker.

08:01.739 --> 08:02.954
General.

08:02.957 --> 08:04.741
Any word from the rangers?

08:04.742 --> 08:07.744
No, sir.

08:07.745 --> 08:10.747
I have an army of
untrained, undisciplined,

08:10.748 --> 08:12.464
ill-equipped men and not enough of 'em.

08:12.466 --> 08:15.467
That's why I can't sleep.

08:15.469 --> 08:17.921
You got this wound
20-some odd years ago,

08:17.922 --> 08:19.137
and it still festers?

08:19.140 --> 08:20.823
Damn it.

08:20.841 --> 08:22.825
Huh? Yes.

08:22.843 --> 08:24.993
1814... Battle of Horseshoe Bend.

08:25.012 --> 08:26.612
Musket ball.

08:28.015 --> 08:31.184
Caught a red stick arrow
in the groin there too.

08:31.185 --> 08:35.739
Thanks to the Great Spirit,
my manhood remained intact.

08:38.491 --> 08:40.659
Little chips of splintered bone

08:40.660 --> 08:43.261
still working their way out.

08:44.832 --> 08:46.831
I sent Bowie to Travis with an order

08:46.834 --> 08:50.453
to blow up the Alamo, abandon it.

08:50.454 --> 08:52.678
I can't imagine what a trial it must be

08:52.679 --> 08:54.841
to live with this.

08:54.842 --> 08:57.192
Sir, Baker and Sherman

08:57.211 --> 08:59.095
are still waiting to see you.

08:59.096 --> 09:00.713
Much obliged.

09:00.714 --> 09:03.633
"Here to be seen seeing
me" is more like it.

09:03.634 --> 09:06.803
Delegation's arrived to
say, "Attack the Mexicans."

09:06.804 --> 09:09.606
Huh, delegation!

09:09.607 --> 09:13.560
Well, by God, come in this
instant, if not sooner.

09:13.561 --> 09:17.564
There's Juan Seguín too, sir.

09:17.565 --> 09:20.733
With due regard to the urgency
of your call, gentlemen,

09:20.734 --> 09:23.719
I hope you don't mind me
answering a call of my own.

09:23.737 --> 09:28.958
General, we mean no ill regard.

09:28.959 --> 09:34.062
We're just curious to what your plan is.

09:34.081 --> 09:36.064
I sent Deaf Smith and
his rangering company

09:36.083 --> 09:39.234
to report on the Alamo situation.

09:39.253 --> 09:41.754
Until I hear back,

09:41.755 --> 09:44.557
it'd be damn stupid to fix on any plan.

09:44.558 --> 09:46.241
There's only one plan.

09:46.260 --> 09:48.094
Attack the Alamo.

09:48.095 --> 09:51.815
Mosley, I think you know
me better than to address me

09:51.816 --> 09:53.516
like I'm some dumb son of a bitch.

09:53.517 --> 09:55.101
I cannot imagine your intention

09:55.102 --> 09:58.771
is to abandon those men, sir.

09:58.772 --> 10:00.523
It's what Davy Crockett's promising

10:00.524 --> 10:01.741
to keep their spirits hopeful.

10:01.742 --> 10:04.909
Juan, how many men are we?

10:04.912 --> 10:06.112
374...

10:06.113 --> 10:08.764
by this morning's count.

10:08.782 --> 10:11.266
What are our supplies?

10:11.285 --> 10:14.120
Two days of beans, no meat,

10:14.121 --> 10:17.773
and we're certainly short
of muskets, powder, and shot.

10:20.511 --> 10:23.213
Let me understand this.

10:23.214 --> 10:26.097
You think we ought to
attack 5,000 well-armed,

10:26.100 --> 10:30.118
well-fed Mexican veterans
supported by artillery.

10:30.137 --> 10:31.971
We do have the element of surprise, sir.

10:31.972 --> 10:33.273
Huh!

10:33.274 --> 10:36.142
It does not matter how many there are.

10:36.143 --> 10:38.895
They are only Mexicans.

10:38.896 --> 10:41.231
Juan!

10:41.232 --> 10:43.816
You're a fool, Mosley.

10:43.817 --> 10:46.969
I should let Seguín
here cut your tongue out.

10:46.987 --> 10:50.973
General, what of Colonel
Fannin's relief column?

10:50.991 --> 10:54.878
George, tell them the
status on Colonel Fannin.

10:54.879 --> 10:56.045
Our courageous colonel

10:56.046 --> 10:58.248
was on his way to the Alamo

10:58.249 --> 11:01.668
when two wagons broke
down betwixt and between.

11:01.669 --> 11:06.055
So he decided to change
course and return to Goliad.

11:06.056 --> 11:07.656
That is all the more reason

11:07.675 --> 11:10.492
we need to reinforce
Travis and Jim Bowie.

11:10.511 --> 11:13.495
Sam, what would your

11:13.514 --> 11:17.616
personal compunctions lead you to do?

11:20.237 --> 11:23.606
I will tell you what I'm not gonna do.

11:23.607 --> 11:27.076
I'm not gonna sacrifice
what little army I have

11:27.077 --> 11:29.779
by charging pell-mell
into Mexican lances.

11:29.780 --> 11:33.116
I will not fight Santa Anna
the way he wants us to fight,

11:33.117 --> 11:35.952
nor the way you think I should.

11:35.953 --> 11:37.686
Gentlemen,

11:37.705 --> 11:40.385
Texas is struggling to break free

11:40.386 --> 11:41.857
from an oppressive regime.

11:41.875 --> 11:43.092
No.

11:43.093 --> 11:44.761
We must fight for our independence

11:44.762 --> 11:46.678
like George Washington
and our forefathers

11:46.680 --> 11:49.848
fought for theirs...
with speed and mobility.

11:49.850 --> 11:51.134
Fall back.

11:51.135 --> 11:54.036
Live to fight another day.

11:54.054 --> 11:58.558
Deaf Smith and his rangers
have the right idea.

11:58.559 --> 12:00.024
As your commander,

12:00.027 --> 12:03.045
I will decide when the
day is right to do more.

12:05.115 --> 12:07.650
Now that you've been elucidated,

12:07.651 --> 12:11.821
get the hell out!

12:11.822 --> 12:13.221
General.

12:15.659 --> 12:18.760
- Juan.
- General.

12:21.832 --> 12:24.667
If it means anything,

12:24.668 --> 12:28.838
your amigos at the Alamo
call out to me in my dreams.

12:43.937 --> 12:44.937
Whoo!

12:44.938 --> 12:46.939
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo!

12:46.940 --> 12:48.740
You still get a buck and two bits

12:48.742 --> 12:50.526
a day working for the army?

12:50.527 --> 12:52.829
Rangers don't work for the army, Truett.

12:52.830 --> 12:54.546
We're working with the army.

12:54.548 --> 12:56.833
That's right. They don't give us orders.

12:56.834 --> 13:00.936
They offer us recommendations
and suggestions.

13:00.954 --> 13:03.285
Son, I give you a suggestion, by God,

13:03.286 --> 13:05.085
you best know it's a damn order.

13:05.086 --> 13:06.086
Sir.

13:07.956 --> 13:10.291
Hey, don't expect to get
paid anytime soon, boys.

13:10.292 --> 13:12.042
Texas ain't got no money.

13:12.043 --> 13:14.345
Least not till we run
the bean-eaters out.

13:14.346 --> 13:15.695
No offense, Flores.

13:15.697 --> 13:17.515
You's a good bean-eater.

13:17.516 --> 13:18.531
I like you.

13:23.772 --> 13:25.121
What the hell did you say?

13:29.444 --> 13:31.244
Ask him.

13:37.319 --> 13:39.252
Deaf?

13:41.156 --> 13:42.373
Deaf?

13:43.658 --> 13:45.993
What?

13:45.994 --> 13:47.661
Well, after General Houston

13:47.662 --> 13:50.047
quit being governor of Tennessee,

13:50.048 --> 13:52.550
is it true that he lit
out for the territory,

13:52.551 --> 13:54.218
took up with a Cherokee squaw,

13:54.219 --> 13:56.003
and stayed drunk for five years?

13:56.004 --> 14:00.224
I don't know he was drunk every day.

14:00.225 --> 14:03.493
Ask about his Tennessee bride.

14:03.511 --> 14:07.348
What about his tender young wife?

14:07.349 --> 14:08.682
Why'd he leave her

14:08.683 --> 14:10.568
and quit being governor?

14:10.569 --> 14:13.103
Those your words, Henry?

14:13.104 --> 14:14.271
"Tender young wife"?

14:14.272 --> 14:15.940
Ooh!

14:15.941 --> 14:17.191
That's a whole heap nicer

14:17.192 --> 14:20.176
than I would've called her.

14:20.195 --> 14:22.679
I guess she rejected him.

14:22.697 --> 14:25.366
He felt compelled to leave her...

14:25.367 --> 14:27.201
by honor, Henry.

14:27.202 --> 14:28.502
Mm-hmm.

14:28.503 --> 14:31.187
What I heard is, he
attacked her unnaturally.

14:31.206 --> 14:33.207
Now, I heard she had the organs of a man

14:33.208 --> 14:35.125
under the... oh, yeah, yeah.

14:35.126 --> 14:36.509
That's a good one.

14:36.511 --> 14:39.028
Y'all know I can't hear nothing,

14:39.047 --> 14:40.547
and I certainly can't read your lips.

14:40.548 --> 14:42.482
You're sitting all back there.

14:46.021 --> 14:48.472
Now, nobody knows what happened
between the two of them,

14:48.473 --> 14:50.689
but I do know that Sam Houston's

14:50.692 --> 14:52.542
never spoken a word against her,

14:52.560 --> 14:56.713
nor has he allowed one
spoken in his presence.

14:56.731 --> 15:00.717
What does that tell you?

15:00.735 --> 15:03.219
Reckon the same thing it tells you...

15:06.291 --> 15:09.375
That you have a grasp of things

15:09.377 --> 15:13.012
the way we can't sometimes, Erastus.

15:13.014 --> 15:14.781
Let's move out.

15:18.003 --> 15:19.385
Rest time's over, boys.

15:19.387 --> 15:20.386
Saddle up.

15:26.011 --> 15:27.393
General Sam Houston

15:27.395 --> 15:29.562
is a better man than his detractors.

15:29.564 --> 15:31.732
Then why in the hell
ain't he leading his army

15:31.733 --> 15:33.732
to help Bowie and Crockett at the Alamo?

15:33.735 --> 15:36.020
When you're half the
general he is, Elwood,

15:36.021 --> 15:37.670
maybe then I'll listen to you.

15:37.672 --> 15:39.657
It's called military tactics, Vern.

15:39.658 --> 15:41.374
That's why we're on a scout.

15:47.449 --> 15:50.284
Smoke! I seen smoke!

15:50.285 --> 15:52.385
Whoa.

15:55.507 --> 15:58.625
Over there, about 20 miles away.

15:58.626 --> 16:01.110
That's the Alamo. Deaf!

16:11.439 --> 16:14.274
That's the Alamo, boys.

16:14.275 --> 16:17.478
We lost it.

16:17.479 --> 16:19.078
Son of a bitch.

16:21.649 --> 16:23.749
God help us.

16:30.075 --> 16:31.624
Deaf.

16:40.635 --> 16:42.635
They ain't Comanches, is they?

16:42.637 --> 16:44.637
No. Karankawa.

16:44.639 --> 16:46.989
I don't know what they're
doing so far inland.

16:47.008 --> 16:48.491
Thought they was all killed off.

17:03.441 --> 17:07.027
Hell, Injuns killing
Mexicans is fine by me.

17:07.028 --> 17:09.246
So long as they ain't Comanches, right?

17:09.247 --> 17:11.448
Beans, head back.

17:11.449 --> 17:14.585
Inform General Houston
of the fate of the Alamo.

17:14.586 --> 17:16.420
Now, don't dawdle. Don't
get yourself killed.

17:16.421 --> 17:17.538
Future of Texas is at stake.

17:17.539 --> 17:19.205
- Come on.
- Yes, sir.

17:19.207 --> 17:20.540
- Ride on, Beans.
- Ride on, boy.

17:20.541 --> 17:21.708
Come on. Come on.

17:23.211 --> 17:24.545
Hee-yah! Hee-yah!

17:24.546 --> 17:28.432
Those are women in the wagon.

17:28.433 --> 17:30.217
That cuts it.

17:38.309 --> 17:39.476
Ahh!

17:39.477 --> 17:41.210
Yah!

17:54.042 --> 17:55.125
No!

17:57.128 --> 17:58.579
Mama!

18:04.586 --> 18:06.470
They got the little girl!

18:06.471 --> 18:07.711
Let's get him, Truett! Come on!

18:09.140 --> 18:11.508
We coming for you, darling!

18:14.262 --> 18:16.013
Get on that wagon, Kit!

18:50.298 --> 18:52.683
Zacharias, help the lady.

18:58.306 --> 19:00.607
I got her.

19:12.403 --> 19:14.119
I got him!

19:14.122 --> 19:15.656
Stay on him, Truett. Stay up there.

19:15.657 --> 19:16.657
I'm gaining.

19:16.658 --> 19:18.041
Stay up there.

19:18.042 --> 19:19.475
Whoo!

19:25.717 --> 19:27.251
Whoa, whoa.

19:27.252 --> 19:29.969
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:29.971 --> 19:31.305
Shoot him, Truett.

19:33.007 --> 19:34.657
I'm loading, damn it.

19:37.178 --> 19:38.178
All right.

19:38.179 --> 19:39.346
Take your shot. Come on.

19:39.347 --> 19:40.347
I am.

19:40.348 --> 19:41.398
Why don't you shoot him?

19:41.399 --> 19:42.933
Well, I'm trying.

19:50.575 --> 19:54.493
Oh, Yance, I got him! I got him!

19:54.495 --> 19:56.345
- You got him!
- Whoo! I got him!

19:56.364 --> 19:58.031
- You got him.
- Whoo!

19:58.032 --> 20:00.117
- Damn, nice shot.
- Hoo-hoo!

20:00.118 --> 20:01.500
Whoo!

20:01.502 --> 20:02.703
I thought we was goners, boy.

20:02.704 --> 20:04.288
I can't believe I got him.

20:04.289 --> 20:06.623
Well, I would've got him if you hadn't.

20:06.624 --> 20:08.724
Take the scalp.

20:10.545 --> 20:12.262
Well, come on, Truett.

20:12.263 --> 20:15.215
It's your first kill. You earned it.

20:15.216 --> 20:17.100
I don't need no stinky Indian pelt

20:17.101 --> 20:19.102
to prove what I done here.

20:19.103 --> 20:20.387
Hush up.

20:20.388 --> 20:22.389
- Mama!
- It ain't for you.

20:22.390 --> 20:23.557
It's for the young 'UN.

20:23.558 --> 20:25.108
Mama!

20:25.109 --> 20:26.610
When she grows up,

20:26.611 --> 20:28.278
it'll be a reminder
that justice was done

20:28.279 --> 20:30.028
on the savage that killed her mama.

20:30.031 --> 20:32.199
Go.

20:32.200 --> 20:34.667
Mama!

20:40.541 --> 20:42.209
Whoo-hoo!

20:42.210 --> 20:44.211
I don't know what I like better...

20:44.212 --> 20:46.562
killing redskins or killing Mexicans.

20:46.581 --> 20:48.382
Damn it, Vern, quit your yammering.

20:48.383 --> 20:49.565
Mister?

20:52.553 --> 20:54.087
Zacharias.

20:54.088 --> 20:55.756
Did we save them?

20:55.757 --> 20:58.759
Yes.

21:01.429 --> 21:03.279
Whoa. Karnes!

21:08.102 --> 21:11.420
Zacharias took a hit.

21:11.439 --> 21:13.589
- Oh, no.
- Damn.

21:13.608 --> 21:15.424
And you forgot to duck.

21:15.443 --> 21:17.593
I did duck.

21:17.612 --> 21:21.597
This pigsticker would've
stuck me in my chest.

21:21.616 --> 21:22.598
Yeah.

21:27.288 --> 21:28.622
What's your name, darling?

21:28.623 --> 21:30.290
Susanna.

21:30.291 --> 21:31.291
Susanna what?

21:31.292 --> 21:32.292
Dickinson.

21:34.178 --> 21:35.512
He was doing his duty.

21:35.513 --> 21:38.348
He died helping me.

21:38.349 --> 21:40.449
So long, Zach.

21:42.637 --> 21:46.789
Captain, the woman with the baby,

21:46.808 --> 21:48.791
that's Almaron Dickinson's wife.

21:48.810 --> 21:52.062
Lieutenant at the Alamo.

21:52.063 --> 21:54.231
They're the only survivors.

21:54.232 --> 21:56.066
All right, everybody.

21:56.067 --> 21:58.068
We got to move out.

21:58.069 --> 22:00.619
Leave the wagons and
them Indian horses behind.

22:00.621 --> 22:01.637
What for?

22:03.458 --> 22:05.709
Comanches.

22:06.711 --> 22:07.711
Oh, shit.

22:13.217 --> 22:14.501
Take the little one.

22:14.502 --> 22:16.134
Don't let her lay eyes on her mama.

22:16.137 --> 22:18.422
Take the women and the children.

22:18.423 --> 22:21.607
I'll bury Zacharias and this lady.

22:27.432 --> 22:29.599
Save me some poon in hell, big fellow.

22:33.237 --> 22:35.689
Henry, I'm gonna ride on ahead.

22:35.690 --> 22:37.107
See you down the road.

22:37.108 --> 22:38.241
All right.

22:56.177 --> 22:57.860
Adios, amigo.

22:57.879 --> 22:59.195
Let's go, boys.

22:59.213 --> 23:00.714
We're moving on.

23:00.715 --> 23:01.882
Rest in peace, Zacharias.

23:01.883 --> 23:03.816
We'll miss you, sir.

23:08.606 --> 23:10.206
Let's go, boy.

23:32.379 --> 23:35.214
Santa Anna's taken the Alamo!

23:35.215 --> 23:37.249
The Alamo is lost!

23:37.250 --> 23:38.751
Lordy, Lordy...

23:38.752 --> 23:42.254
Santa Anna's taken the Alamo!

23:42.255 --> 23:45.925
We've lost the Alamo!
We've lost the Alamo!

23:47.477 --> 23:49.261
Santa Anna's taken the Alamo!

23:51.314 --> 23:53.482
The Alamo has fallen!

23:53.483 --> 23:56.352
Santa Anna's taken the Alamo!

24:01.191 --> 24:03.705
_

24:04.393 --> 24:07.014
_

24:09.568 --> 24:11.255
_

24:12.868 --> 24:14.527
_

24:15.806 --> 24:17.450
_

24:19.657 --> 24:20.687
_

24:23.403 --> 24:24.977
_

24:25.666 --> 24:28.288
_

24:29.132 --> 24:29.911
_

24:30.435 --> 24:32.339
_

24:32.882 --> 24:34.802
_

24:42.270 --> 24:44.139
_

24:44.542 --> 24:46.299
_

24:46.925 --> 24:48.678
_

25:01.585 --> 25:03.217
_

25:10.343 --> 25:11.826
Gracias.

25:12.929 --> 25:14.912
Deaf?

25:19.936 --> 25:21.437
Siéntete.

25:28.278 --> 25:30.613
Oh...

25:30.614 --> 25:34.716
Guadalupe, I ain't back.

25:37.337 --> 25:39.788
Not yet, I ain't back.

25:39.789 --> 25:41.957
I just come to get the wagon

25:41.958 --> 25:43.709
on account of some women and young 'uns

25:43.710 --> 25:46.427
that they were gonna
slaughter at the Alamo.

25:46.429 --> 25:48.596
They need medical
doctoring. I raced ahead.

25:48.598 --> 25:51.350
They're a few miles back.

25:51.351 --> 25:53.267
Let them stay here.

25:53.269 --> 25:55.888
I'll nurse them and you.

25:55.889 --> 25:57.890
You're too sick to fight.

25:57.891 --> 25:58.990
Come.

26:00.977 --> 26:03.646
No, no,

26:03.647 --> 26:05.630
Lupe, por favor, sit.

26:09.452 --> 26:13.622
I got to get everybody back to camp.

26:13.623 --> 26:17.626
Fighting is the only way
we got to win this war,

26:17.627 --> 26:20.629
and fighting's all I know.

26:20.630 --> 26:22.730
Houston's counting on us.

26:26.886 --> 26:29.588
I promise you

26:29.589 --> 26:32.490
I will be back before you know it.

26:58.785 --> 27:00.668
Cuídamelo.

27:06.843 --> 27:08.343
What a sweet girl.

27:08.344 --> 27:09.861
You done good.

27:09.879 --> 27:11.714
Get some rest.

27:14.718 --> 27:17.386
This young mare done me proud today,

27:17.387 --> 27:18.937
but she's tuckered.

27:18.938 --> 27:22.474
You mind giving her a
good water and a feeding?

27:22.475 --> 27:23.741
Sí.

27:35.739 --> 27:38.055
I got plenty of linens.

28:01.931 --> 28:05.768
You mind hanging on to that for me?

28:05.769 --> 28:08.753
I'll be back.

28:17.947 --> 28:19.281
Yah.

28:42.939 --> 28:44.940
About 20 years ago,

28:44.941 --> 28:47.942
my first campaign was in Texas,

28:47.944 --> 28:51.445
serving with General Arredondo,

28:51.447 --> 28:54.248
who put down a rebellion
much like this one.

28:58.321 --> 29:02.807
I call this bird Arredondo.

29:02.826 --> 29:05.377
He's never known defeat.

29:05.378 --> 29:07.462
Look at his eyes.

29:07.463 --> 29:10.932
Almonte, they are mad.

29:14.337 --> 29:19.205
I remember once, Arredondo slaughtered

29:19.206 --> 29:23.092
over 1,000 of American
pirates and wayward Tejanos,

29:23.093 --> 29:27.213
then left their corpses
to rot in the field,

29:27.214 --> 29:31.149
unburied, for all to see and smell.

29:33.220 --> 29:35.054
We left all of Texas

29:35.055 --> 29:37.940
covered in tears and ashes

29:37.941 --> 29:39.225
as a warning to whoever again

29:39.226 --> 29:42.978
might raise their hand against Mexico.

29:42.979 --> 29:46.782
At the time, some of us young officers

29:46.783 --> 29:49.402
thought the general too ruthless,

29:49.403 --> 29:53.054
you know, too unnecessarily cruel.

29:55.075 --> 29:57.910
But we know now we were wrong.

29:57.911 --> 30:01.747
Arredondo was not harsh enough,

30:01.748 --> 30:03.916
and this is why we're fighting today...

30:03.917 --> 30:08.603
because he was not harsh enough.

30:11.975 --> 30:15.261
I will win this battle.

30:15.262 --> 30:16.762
I will win it for you.

30:16.763 --> 30:18.514
So 20 years from now,

30:18.515 --> 30:20.516
you will not have to
lead your sons north

30:20.517 --> 30:22.250
to fight this war again,

30:22.269 --> 30:26.772
because Santa Anna, like
Arredondo before him,

30:26.773 --> 30:30.508
was not man enough to
win it once and for all.

30:33.330 --> 30:35.448
I don't fight for Texas.

30:35.449 --> 30:38.117
I don't care about politics.

30:38.118 --> 30:39.785
Then why do you fight?

30:39.786 --> 30:43.054
It's in my blood, like this bird.

30:44.508 --> 30:46.375
Does the blood make him stronger?

30:46.376 --> 30:48.043
We'll see.

30:48.044 --> 30:51.881
Only a select few can become champions.

30:51.882 --> 30:53.147
Take this one.

30:55.135 --> 30:58.971
He loves tequila but rejects my blood.

30:58.972 --> 31:01.390
I call him General Houston.

31:01.391 --> 31:02.858
Fitting.

31:02.859 --> 31:04.292
Get the blood.

31:08.031 --> 31:09.947
See?

31:09.950 --> 31:13.951
No matter how you
train it or dress it up,

31:13.954 --> 31:15.404
it's a chicken.

31:20.994 --> 31:24.929
And chickens lose their heads.

31:37.223 --> 31:40.601
They're coming in from the Alamo!

31:40.602 --> 31:42.502
The survivors!

31:47.208 --> 31:49.742
- It's a baby.
- Hang on.

31:52.063 --> 31:53.329
Whoa.

31:53.348 --> 31:54.515
Everyone just stand back.

31:54.516 --> 31:56.517
Get through.

31:56.518 --> 31:58.068
You, fetch Doc Ewing.

31:58.069 --> 31:59.403
We got a sickly woman here.

31:59.404 --> 32:00.687
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Don't worry.

32:00.688 --> 32:02.406
It's all right. It's all right. Please.

32:02.407 --> 32:04.241
Hey, what do I do with this shit bugger?

32:04.242 --> 32:06.076
Give her to the doc?

32:06.077 --> 32:07.611
Make up a bedroom in my tent.

32:07.612 --> 32:09.079
We'll see come morning.

32:09.080 --> 32:10.581
Now I'm a damn nursemaid.

32:10.582 --> 32:12.583
Everybody, stand back.
Get out of the way.

32:12.584 --> 32:14.118
Give me the baby.

32:14.119 --> 32:16.587
Let me help. Please, just let me help.

32:18.256 --> 32:19.590
It's gonna be all right.

32:23.511 --> 32:25.344
Ma'am?

32:25.346 --> 32:28.197
Ma'am, it's all right.

32:28.216 --> 32:29.766
It's all right, ma'am.

32:29.767 --> 32:32.769
Give me your hand.

32:32.770 --> 32:36.773
Please, ma'am,

32:36.774 --> 32:38.574
come with me.

33:02.467 --> 33:03.683
Captain.

33:05.503 --> 33:07.671
Thank you.

33:07.672 --> 33:09.506
You all right?

33:09.507 --> 33:11.758
What happened?

33:11.759 --> 33:16.230
Where's Zachariah and Anderson?

33:16.231 --> 33:21.584
Anderson stayed back to bury Zacharias.

33:21.603 --> 33:23.202
Zachariah...

33:24.656 --> 33:26.289
You sure?

33:30.778 --> 33:32.595
Yeah.

33:42.207 --> 33:44.041
Had to be Comanches.

33:44.042 --> 33:45.758
I knew it was Comanches.

33:45.760 --> 33:47.760
Fellows, were it Comanches?

33:47.762 --> 33:49.379
Nah, Karankawa.

33:51.216 --> 33:53.217
- Deaf, we going to Alamo?
- Mind your business!

33:53.218 --> 33:54.434
Deaf, ain't you gonna go

33:54.435 --> 33:55.602
to the aid of our patriots?

33:55.603 --> 33:57.020
That's up to Sam Houston, son.

33:57.021 --> 33:59.022
- Who's she?
- Out of the way!

33:59.023 --> 34:02.726
Deaf, what's going on, Deaf?

34:02.727 --> 34:04.561
- What about Travis?
- Crockett?

34:04.562 --> 34:07.296
Bowie?

34:07.315 --> 34:09.465
Dead.

34:09.484 --> 34:12.319
All dead, boys.

34:19.744 --> 34:21.594
General.

34:25.300 --> 34:26.750
General Houston,

34:26.751 --> 34:29.303
this here's Emily West.

34:29.304 --> 34:31.821
Herself and Captain Dickinson's wife

34:31.839 --> 34:34.824
were among the few Alamo survivors.

34:34.842 --> 34:36.275
Ma'am.

34:37.562 --> 34:39.328
Ms. West.

34:44.435 --> 34:45.583
Water.

35:12.714 --> 35:16.699
Santa Anna took no prisoners.

35:16.718 --> 35:21.504
We were spared to carry his message.

35:23.057 --> 35:25.559
He'll show no mercy...

35:30.565 --> 35:32.689
Killing all who oppose him.

35:34.819 --> 35:39.623
Plans to poison the wells and fields

35:39.624 --> 35:42.429
so that people never return.

35:44.245 --> 35:47.178
Burn every ranch, every settlement,

35:47.179 --> 35:48.661
every building.

35:52.851 --> 35:57.321
Santa Anna has ordered General Urrea

35:57.322 --> 35:59.857
to attack Goliad for his next slaughter.

35:59.858 --> 36:01.859
Mexicans attacking Goliad...

36:06.748 --> 36:09.200
He mocks you to his men.

36:12.337 --> 36:14.121
He named a chicken after you.

36:25.217 --> 36:27.218
It's not wrong you survived.

36:37.112 --> 36:38.861
Chris, I just heard.

36:38.864 --> 36:41.297
Santa Anna will show no mercy.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.988
Tom, I got news.

36:46.989 --> 36:51.292
Santa Anna is moving 500
men on Goliad... 500 men.

36:51.293 --> 36:53.294
He's attacking Fannin at Goliad.

36:53.295 --> 36:56.213
I heard he named a damn
chicken after our general.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.215
Goliad's next.

36:58.216 --> 37:02.152
Slitherin' snake son of a
bitch means to wipe us out.

37:03.305 --> 37:05.105
This is all messed up.

37:07.726 --> 37:09.844
Ma'am, we're gonna get
you to the medical tent

37:09.845 --> 37:11.945
and get some food in your belly.

37:15.033 --> 37:16.899
You should know they held out 12 days,

37:16.902 --> 37:18.751
waiting for you.

37:18.770 --> 37:20.753
Last thing I heard Colonel Travis yell

37:20.772 --> 37:22.872
was, "No surrender."

37:24.826 --> 37:27.278
Yeah, yeah.

37:27.279 --> 37:28.761
All right.

37:31.116 --> 37:32.432
God damn it!

37:32.451 --> 37:34.368
Was I not appointed to
lead all Texian forces

37:34.369 --> 37:36.370
as commander in chief?

37:36.371 --> 37:38.172
- Was I?
- Yes, sir.

37:38.173 --> 37:41.274
Then why didn't they obey my
order to abandon the Alamo?

37:52.304 --> 37:54.204
I should have gone in myself.

37:56.308 --> 38:00.276
We can't let this sacrifice be in vain.

38:00.278 --> 38:04.280
Their precious blood
bought us precious time.

38:04.282 --> 38:07.735
Let us not squander it.

38:07.736 --> 38:11.287
Deaf, as a loyal Texian citizen

38:11.289 --> 38:12.873
and foremost authority on this land,

38:12.874 --> 38:16.877
I'd value your opinion about now.

38:16.878 --> 38:20.331
Deaf, do you understand me?

38:20.332 --> 38:23.016
I'm deaf, not dumb.

38:24.419 --> 38:26.152
San Antone is too close

38:26.171 --> 38:28.154
to Mexico proper to reinforce,

38:28.173 --> 38:31.974
too far from American
settlements to defend.

38:31.977 --> 38:36.097
We ought to move north of
Victoria, marshal our forces.

38:36.098 --> 38:40.333
Let Santa Anna get drunk on
an abundance of confidence.

38:40.352 --> 38:43.819
And then, General,

38:43.822 --> 38:46.256
we attack with a vengeance.

38:50.612 --> 38:53.614
If only I had 300 more rangers like you,

38:53.615 --> 38:55.950
I'd win this war in a day.

38:55.951 --> 38:58.085
I want you to ride to Goliad

38:58.086 --> 39:00.087
and, one more time,
instruct Colonel Fannin

39:00.088 --> 39:02.206
to abandon his position there posthaste

39:02.207 --> 39:03.973
and rendezvous with us at Victoria.

39:07.762 --> 39:10.346
Make sure he understands
he'll be all by his lonesome

39:10.348 --> 39:13.801
with enemy troops up
his ass within the week.

39:13.802 --> 39:17.820
Tell him this time, I said please.

39:19.224 --> 39:20.391
Yes, sir.

39:20.392 --> 39:23.359
I'll tell him.

39:23.361 --> 39:25.712
Ready the men.

39:25.730 --> 39:28.331
Tomorrow at first light,
we march to Victoria.

39:35.123 --> 39:36.624
Prepare to retreat.

39:36.625 --> 39:38.159
Pass the word. We retreat.

39:38.160 --> 39:39.875
Pass the word.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.328
What the hell we waitin' for?

40:00.498 --> 40:01.798
Sarah.

40:01.799 --> 40:03.416
Mama taught me

40:03.417 --> 40:05.001
to ease a woman's burden
every chance I got.

40:05.002 --> 40:06.586
Yeah, well, she should've taught you

40:06.587 --> 40:08.136
not to be such a horse's ass.

40:08.138 --> 40:10.138
Oh, pardon my crass
friend's language, ma'am.

40:10.140 --> 40:12.140
Thank you, Truett. Thank you, Yancey.

40:12.142 --> 40:13.659
But unless you're injured,

40:13.677 --> 40:15.678
you're not allowed
inside the medical tent.

40:15.679 --> 40:19.015
Well, I got a serious
cut on my elbow someplace,

40:19.016 --> 40:21.184
and I'm pretty sure
it needs some liniment.

40:21.185 --> 40:25.287
Yeah, well, I have a
badly bruised heart.

40:28.526 --> 40:31.009
Stop horsing around like
nothing happened today.

40:33.747 --> 40:37.584
We... we didn't want
to scare you, Sarah.

40:37.585 --> 40:40.218
It's tragic sad about Zacharias.

40:43.707 --> 40:46.042
Don't fret about us.

40:46.043 --> 40:48.644
Truett here got his first scalp.

40:56.136 --> 40:58.687
Should've told her right away

40:58.689 --> 41:00.188
instead of trying to curry favor.

41:00.190 --> 41:01.858
It was your "bruised heart" manure

41:01.859 --> 41:03.041
that set her off.

41:03.060 --> 41:04.394
She was gonna treat my elbow.

41:04.395 --> 41:05.728
Treat your goddamn elbow...

41:05.729 --> 41:07.195
- She was.
- Ah, quit your bellyaching.

41:07.197 --> 41:08.731
- She would have.
- Quiet down, boys.

41:08.732 --> 41:10.617
- We got sick people here.
- Don't push me.

41:10.618 --> 41:12.584
You got me in trouble.

41:18.742 --> 41:20.410
Don't you stand out on that ridge.

41:20.411 --> 41:22.795
They'll see you for a mile, son.

41:22.796 --> 41:24.797
Knowles.

41:24.798 --> 41:27.667
Hell you going, Private?

41:27.668 --> 41:29.768
Don't rightly know.

41:33.724 --> 41:34.841
You deserting?

41:34.842 --> 41:36.643
The army needs you, soldier.

41:42.099 --> 41:43.483
It's all balls-up.

41:43.484 --> 41:44.817
Don't worry about it.

41:53.444 --> 41:54.676
Lookit there.

41:57.615 --> 41:58.831
That's a wolf.

41:58.832 --> 42:01.167
Mm, more like a wolf dog.

42:01.168 --> 42:03.602
Come here, boy.

42:03.621 --> 42:05.755
Come over here. Say howdy.

42:05.756 --> 42:07.457
You've been following us.

42:07.458 --> 42:09.008
- He ain't coming.
- Yep.

42:09.009 --> 42:11.010
Hey, that's my personal rabbit.

42:11.011 --> 42:12.978
It's requisitioned.

42:16.934 --> 42:18.635
- This a damn jackrabbit?
- Yeah.

42:18.636 --> 42:22.138
Smells like three-day-old possum.

42:22.139 --> 42:24.524
Pilfers a rabbit and complains.

42:24.525 --> 42:27.143
I seasoned that rabbit just right.

42:27.144 --> 42:29.529
Come on, boy. Look what I got for you.

42:29.530 --> 42:31.981
Lookie here. Come on.

42:31.982 --> 42:34.583
That mongrel's gonna
bite your arm clean off.

42:35.486 --> 42:36.736
Come on.

42:36.737 --> 42:38.488
Now I know why they call you Beans...

42:38.489 --> 42:40.622
'cause that's the only
thing you can cook.

42:40.624 --> 42:41.790
Ha!

42:43.460 --> 42:44.976
He don't like your cookings, Beans.

42:44.995 --> 42:47.630
I saw that dog lick its own ass.

42:47.631 --> 42:48.814
He don't know.

42:56.056 --> 42:57.724
Ventured up, Captain...

42:57.725 --> 42:59.509
over on the right.

42:59.510 --> 43:01.060
Captain?

43:01.061 --> 43:02.811
Uh, Captain?

43:02.813 --> 43:04.097
Captain?

43:04.098 --> 43:05.648
Young Truett here

43:05.649 --> 43:07.517
is grievously worried about his ma

43:07.518 --> 43:09.686
and requests a short leave of absence.

43:09.687 --> 43:12.689
Yeah, it's my mother
and my sisters, sir.

43:12.690 --> 43:14.440
And, well, since I lost my daddy

43:14.441 --> 43:16.693
to typhoid three years ago, you know,

43:16.694 --> 43:18.578
I'm the only man of the house.

43:18.579 --> 43:21.030
Yeah, and with that cutthroat
Santa Anna marching north,

43:21.031 --> 43:23.583
well, the Fincham family
ranch is right in his path.

43:23.584 --> 43:25.618
Yeah, I just want to
make sure they moved out.

43:25.619 --> 43:27.519
You know, shouldn't take
me more than a day or two

43:27.538 --> 43:29.789
just to get them someplace safe.

43:29.790 --> 43:31.791
And I request to go with him, Captain.

43:31.792 --> 43:33.960
Make sure he comes back.

43:33.961 --> 43:36.045
The boy can hardly wipe
himself without my counsel.

43:36.046 --> 43:37.630
Oh, shut up.

43:37.631 --> 43:39.610
He just want to run
into some more Indians

43:39.611 --> 43:41.700
so he can get a scalp like mine, sir.

43:45.723 --> 43:47.656
That all of it, then?

43:53.897 --> 43:55.114
One day.

43:55.115 --> 43:57.483
I'll give you all one day.

43:57.484 --> 44:01.154
Then you meet us in Goliad.

44:01.155 --> 44:02.405
- Get.
- Sir.

44:02.406 --> 44:03.656
Sir.

44:03.657 --> 44:04.957
If we leave in the morning,

44:04.958 --> 44:06.391
we can get there by noon.

44:16.587 --> 44:18.504
Hunker down. It's ready.

44:23.594 --> 44:25.478
And that's looking good, fellows.

44:25.479 --> 44:27.146
Look at you.

44:34.438 --> 44:39.025
You a part of Stephen
Austin's rangering company?

44:39.026 --> 44:41.944
Glad you're back, Billy.

44:41.945 --> 44:43.613
Who's asking?

44:43.614 --> 44:46.115
Name's Beauregard.

44:46.116 --> 44:49.267
I hear tell you might
need an extra hand.

44:49.286 --> 44:51.970
Looks like you could use one too, Red.

44:57.928 --> 44:59.128
My mama'd throw that in the pot

44:59.129 --> 45:00.847
with the cayenne pepper
and call it gumbo.

45:00.848 --> 45:01.964
You from Louisiana?

45:01.965 --> 45:04.467
Crawled up from the bayou.

45:04.468 --> 45:08.187
Call me Gator... Gator Davis.

45:08.188 --> 45:10.473
Thought you was Beauregard.

45:10.474 --> 45:13.942
Gator Davis Beauregard,

45:13.944 --> 45:16.110
Esquire.

45:16.113 --> 45:18.496
I'm of a mind to join your outfit.

45:21.902 --> 45:25.321
You want to help
Texas, go join the army.

45:25.322 --> 45:26.989
Oh, no.

45:26.990 --> 45:29.641
My flat feet ain't suited for marching.

45:29.660 --> 45:32.126
I want to ranger around with y'all,

45:32.129 --> 45:34.145
help citizens directly.

45:42.172 --> 45:45.508
You got to furnish
your own horse and gun.

45:45.509 --> 45:47.009
Pays $1.25 a day,

45:47.010 --> 45:49.395
payable whenever
Austin raises the funds.

45:49.396 --> 45:53.099
Best see what he's made of first.

45:53.100 --> 45:54.666
Okeydokey by me.

45:57.321 --> 45:59.587
Introduce yourself to the fellers.

46:03.660 --> 46:05.593
That's all.

46:27.384 --> 46:29.567
Private, hold.

46:31.388 --> 46:33.538
I'm sorry to bother you, Mrs. Dickinson.

46:33.557 --> 46:35.224
Can you tell me,

46:35.225 --> 46:38.110
how many carriers did Santa Anna bring?

46:38.111 --> 46:41.113
How many soldiers?

46:41.114 --> 46:43.616
Kill them.

46:43.617 --> 46:45.033
Kill them all.

46:58.781 --> 47:00.581
Sarah.

47:00.600 --> 47:02.901
General Houston wants
us to scout on ahead

47:02.902 --> 47:06.404
and track down Santa Anna.

47:06.405 --> 47:08.406
You've risked your lives enough.

47:08.407 --> 47:11.793
Why can't he send somebody
older, more experienced?

47:11.794 --> 47:15.630
I reckon 'cause...

47:15.631 --> 47:17.881
we's the best he got.

47:17.883 --> 47:21.586
Being heroes is our cross to bear.

47:21.587 --> 47:25.356
Now, my dear granny Lulu, she...

47:26.592 --> 47:28.143
She...

47:28.144 --> 47:31.346
She pressed this flower
in the family Bible

47:31.347 --> 47:33.230
on her wedding day.

47:33.232 --> 47:35.999
I want you to hold on to
that until I come back.

47:38.404 --> 47:40.522
- Thank you, Truett.
- Yeah.

47:40.523 --> 47:46.009
Uh, ma'am, you don't
have to give this back.

47:47.697 --> 47:51.499
It's a part of me that you are to keep

47:51.500 --> 47:54.584
long as the rivers run.

47:54.587 --> 47:55.704
"Long as the rivers run."

47:55.705 --> 47:56.871
Shut it.

47:56.872 --> 47:59.374
Come here.

48:08.801 --> 48:10.302
I'll be madder than a wet hen

48:10.303 --> 48:12.403
if anything happens to either of you.

48:14.774 --> 48:17.791
So doggone it, you better
take care of each other.

48:19.945 --> 48:21.696
Yes, ma'am.

48:21.697 --> 48:22.697
Yes, ma'am.

48:28.654 --> 48:31.573
- Ooh, she likes me.
- She hugged me tighter.

48:31.574 --> 48:32.574
- Did not.
- Did too.

48:32.575 --> 48:34.743
- Did not.
- Did so.

48:34.744 --> 48:36.260
Boy...

48:40.583 --> 48:43.684
_

48:44.906 --> 48:47.702
_

48:48.875 --> 48:50.279
_

48:52.320 --> 48:53.321
_

48:53.725 --> 48:55.122
_

48:57.400 --> 48:58.665
For who?

49:00.403 --> 49:02.404
You can ride with the rangers,

49:02.405 --> 49:05.322
kill Mexicans for them.

49:05.324 --> 49:08.325
But if you think you'll
ever be one of them,

49:08.327 --> 49:09.527
you're a fool.

49:09.528 --> 49:12.947
Fighting for the revolution.

49:12.948 --> 49:16.500
We're losing, Manuel,

49:16.502 --> 49:17.834
and I don't trust the Anglos

49:17.837 --> 49:20.205
any more than the Santanistas.

49:20.206 --> 49:21.355
What becomes of us?

49:21.374 --> 49:22.856
We'll be free.

49:22.875 --> 49:26.544
Santa Anna promises the
same if we fight for him.

49:26.545 --> 49:31.633
Who do you trust more,
for your family's sake,

49:31.634 --> 49:33.400
Santa Anna or Houston?

49:55.908 --> 49:57.292
- Working on it.
- Yep.

49:57.293 --> 49:58.743
If you stop saying...

50:00.996 --> 50:02.664
Reckon it ain't my cooking

50:02.665 --> 50:05.667
the dog don't like,

50:05.668 --> 50:07.651
Henry.

50:18.431 --> 50:19.981
Got a pint in my saddlebag.

50:19.982 --> 50:21.599
You need a slug to ease the pain?

50:21.600 --> 50:24.185
I'm fine,

50:24.186 --> 50:25.569
but before we go to Goliad,

50:25.571 --> 50:27.254
I got to take the buckboard back...

50:27.273 --> 50:30.442
pay respects to the missus.

50:30.443 --> 50:32.292
See you at sunup.

50:47.626 --> 50:49.627
Pack those up front.

50:49.628 --> 50:51.379
You should be going first.

50:56.886 --> 50:58.553
Seems like your tune

50:58.554 --> 51:00.454
is distressing the youngster, señor.

51:00.473 --> 51:02.956
Let me see that guitar.

51:02.975 --> 51:05.894
You gonna take that
from a greenhorn, Flores?

51:05.895 --> 51:08.829
I'm gonna lighten the
mood for you, little lady.

51:19.658 --> 51:21.326
Well, now all we needs is a jug

51:21.327 --> 51:23.460
and a sweet little gal to poke.

51:41.814 --> 51:43.647
She wants you, Deaf.

52:10.509 --> 52:11.876
What do you think, Captain?

52:11.877 --> 52:13.761
It's growing on me.

52:33.532 --> 52:36.534
- I got to go.
- Go away from here.

52:36.535 --> 52:39.537
You stink like a she
goat at mating time.

52:41.156 --> 52:44.541
We don't want to smell
your shit all night.

53:33.108 --> 53:35.392
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, vamos!

53:38.947 --> 53:40.698
Hey, hey, hey!

53:57.799 --> 53:59.899
8 pesos, Presidente.

54:08.059 --> 54:10.895
I did not bet that bird, chuparlo.

54:10.896 --> 54:12.945
Yes, you did, mi General.

54:14.849 --> 54:16.734
8 pesos.

54:16.735 --> 54:19.904
How is it you have 8 pesos to bet with?

54:19.905 --> 54:22.288
As a fact, I do, Excellency.

54:25.994 --> 54:28.094
You have not been paid.

54:30.248 --> 54:32.515
If you have 8 pesos...

54:36.254 --> 54:39.790
You robbed them from the women refugees.

54:39.791 --> 54:42.376
And if you robbed them,
you raped them also.

54:42.377 --> 54:43.877
No, no, no, mi General.

54:43.878 --> 54:45.528
I know this.

54:48.049 --> 54:50.968
Do you know what "magnanimous" is?

54:50.969 --> 54:52.219
No, sir.

54:52.220 --> 54:55.889
Then, though you did not win,

54:55.890 --> 55:01.979
raped grandmothers, and
lied to your General,

55:01.980 --> 55:03.314
I pay you.

55:03.315 --> 55:07.985
I pay you because we are victorious

55:07.986 --> 55:11.087
and to show you what "magnanimous" is.

55:28.056 --> 55:30.823
Do not try such a trick again.

55:35.897 --> 55:38.766
Enough rest and celebration.

55:38.767 --> 55:40.985
Almonte, assume command.

55:40.986 --> 55:42.418
Yes, General.

55:44.439 --> 55:46.843
_

55:49.198 --> 55:51.046
_

55:51.962 --> 55:54.336
_

55:54.866 --> 55:56.200
_

56:14.052 --> 56:16.053
Buenas noches, Juan.

56:20.975 --> 56:22.860
As you were.

56:39.411 --> 56:41.412
Emily?

56:41.413 --> 56:43.396
It's Sam.

56:46.919 --> 56:49.136
I brought you some fresh
clothes and something to eat...

56:49.137 --> 56:50.820
You're as blustery as ever, Sam.

56:50.839 --> 56:52.139
And you are...

56:52.140 --> 56:54.141
I'm alive.

56:54.142 --> 56:57.109
A long way from the French Quarter.

56:59.848 --> 57:02.114
You still have that scarf I gave you.

57:04.486 --> 57:06.953
Don't own much of nothing else.

57:08.490 --> 57:10.173
Emily, I don't flatter myself

57:10.191 --> 57:12.175
that you came all this way to see me.

57:12.193 --> 57:13.944
I came seeking my brother, Jupiter,

57:13.945 --> 57:16.947
to purchase his freedom.

57:16.948 --> 57:20.117
Texas is slave free.

57:20.118 --> 57:22.134
If'n you say so.

57:23.755 --> 57:27.124
I located him at the Alamo Mission,

57:27.125 --> 57:28.876
and I told him he was free,

57:28.877 --> 57:32.713
but he stayed to fight,

57:32.714 --> 57:37.050
ended up one of the last survivors,

57:37.051 --> 57:41.487
and I watched as Santa
Anna had him executed.

57:44.192 --> 57:47.710
Jupiter liked to fight.

57:47.729 --> 57:49.128
A family trait.

57:52.033 --> 57:54.300
At least he died a free man.

57:57.455 --> 57:59.456
I want you to spend a
few days recuperating,

57:59.457 --> 58:01.074
and then I'm gonna get you safe passage

58:01.075 --> 58:02.159
back to New Orleans.

58:02.160 --> 58:03.410
No.

58:03.411 --> 58:09.383
I'm of a mind to stay in Texas,

58:09.384 --> 58:11.017
join the cause.

58:13.922 --> 58:17.641
I could use a horse.

58:17.642 --> 58:21.193
Well, let's discuss that
in the morning, shall we?

58:24.015 --> 58:26.249
It's good to rest my eyes on you again.

58:26.267 --> 58:27.867
Sam...

58:30.104 --> 58:33.539
Jupiter was all I had in this world.

58:36.995 --> 58:40.697
At least he died a hero.

58:40.698 --> 58:43.466
He was more a Texian than any of us.

58:46.371 --> 58:48.020
Get some rest.

59:16.451 --> 59:19.453
You are and always will
be my sweet desert rose.

59:19.454 --> 59:20.821
Deaf!

59:23.324 --> 59:26.976
Come, come.

59:31.716 --> 59:33.166
Close your eyes.

59:33.167 --> 59:34.334
All right.

59:34.335 --> 59:36.152
All right. Don't move.

59:42.427 --> 59:44.276
Papa Deaf...

59:48.349 --> 59:51.852
This poor little soul lost her mama.

59:51.853 --> 59:55.171
Far as I know, there's
no way to look after her.

59:55.189 --> 59:57.991
What's her name?

59:57.992 --> 01:00:01.627
Elena, just like your own ma.

01:00:05.867 --> 01:00:08.300
And this mangy orphan here...

01:00:15.043 --> 01:00:16.892
Call him Half Breed.

01:00:40.151 --> 01:00:42.051
About how much further to San Antone?

01:00:42.070 --> 01:00:44.003
Three or four days at least.

01:00:54.048 --> 01:00:55.716
How do, ma'am?

01:00:55.717 --> 01:00:58.401
I'll have a glass of
that whiskey, please.

01:00:58.419 --> 01:01:00.403
Well...

01:01:00.421 --> 01:01:02.055
Looks like we got ourselves a greenhorn

01:01:02.056 --> 01:01:03.757
come across the river.

01:01:03.758 --> 01:01:05.926
Settle down, Luther. Leave him be.

01:01:05.927 --> 01:01:07.260
Yeah, you.

01:01:07.261 --> 01:01:09.895
I'm talking about you.

01:01:09.897 --> 01:01:13.032
I can smell you like a fat sow.

01:01:23.244 --> 01:01:25.878
Lila, get.

01:01:32.370 --> 01:01:34.037
You remind me of everything

01:01:34.038 --> 01:01:36.673
I come out West to get away from.

01:01:36.674 --> 01:01:37.923
Then I reckon

01:01:37.925 --> 01:01:40.776
your quarrel is with your past,

01:01:40.795 --> 01:01:42.111
not me.

01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:01.898
Now, that was ill-mannered.

01:02:01.899 --> 01:02:04.201
You'll need to replace my drink

01:02:04.202 --> 01:02:06.203
or face consequences.

01:02:11.125 --> 01:02:14.293
This some sort of halfwit idiot,

01:02:14.295 --> 01:02:15.962
or is he just plain stupid?

01:02:15.963 --> 01:02:18.715
You're drunk, Luther.

01:02:18.716 --> 01:02:20.717
Neither.

01:02:20.718 --> 01:02:22.085
Must just be you.

01:02:23.171 --> 01:02:24.820
Go on.

01:02:26.474 --> 01:02:28.392
Don't let nothing but fear stop you.

01:02:28.393 --> 01:02:30.394
Leave it be!

01:02:33.014 --> 01:02:35.015
Ah, settle down, boys.

01:02:35.016 --> 01:02:37.283
Don't you even try it.

01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:45.075
That was a fair fight,
and we all saw it.

01:02:45.076 --> 01:02:48.078
A polite gesture, sir, but I can manage.

01:02:48.079 --> 01:02:51.364
Now, can someone please go fetch

01:02:51.365 --> 01:02:55.919
whomsoever it is around here
that administers justice?

01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:57.887
We need to report this.

01:03:01.375 --> 01:03:04.810
Well, ain't you all gussied up?

01:03:05.930 --> 01:03:07.846
Lupe's big on the pampering.

01:03:07.849 --> 01:03:09.466
Oh.

01:03:09.467 --> 01:03:11.268
You got clean clothes,

01:03:11.269 --> 01:03:15.972
and you got a new young
'un and a wolf-dog pet.

01:03:15.973 --> 01:03:17.856
Well, Lupe must be as happy

01:03:17.859 --> 01:03:20.292
as a bumblebee in a flower patch.

01:03:21.979 --> 01:03:25.232
Yeah, may as well hang up my spurs,

01:03:25.233 --> 01:03:28.235
move to town, work at the general feed.

01:03:30.288 --> 01:03:34.706
Well, you are getting
awful old, my friend.

01:03:34.709 --> 01:03:37.376
Henry, it's 20 miles to go yet.

01:03:37.378 --> 01:03:40.379
Try to keep up.

01:03:40.381 --> 01:03:42.348
Yah!

01:03:51.541 --> 01:03:53.808
Thing?

01:03:57.931 --> 01:04:02.685
I hear tell you're gonna go
fight for Texas, Hard Case.

01:04:02.686 --> 01:04:05.387
Mister, you making light of me?

01:04:05.388 --> 01:04:07.389
Well, after seeing you handle a gun,

01:04:07.390 --> 01:04:10.392
that'd be a pretty dumb idea.

01:04:10.393 --> 01:04:11.727
Name's William Wallace.

01:04:11.728 --> 01:04:13.778
Folks call me Bigfoot.

01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:15.397
On account of you're big?

01:04:15.398 --> 01:04:17.700
That, but mostly 'cause I once

01:04:17.701 --> 01:04:20.536
killed a Cherokee with big feet.

01:04:20.537 --> 01:04:24.323
Bigfoot Wallace, John Coffee Hays.

01:04:24.324 --> 01:04:25.973
Named after Colonel John Coffee,

01:04:25.992 --> 01:04:29.662
protégé of President Andrew Jackson.

01:04:29.663 --> 01:04:30.829
Call me Jack.

01:04:30.830 --> 01:04:32.313
Jack.

01:04:33.833 --> 01:04:35.834
Are... are you some kind of

01:04:35.835 --> 01:04:38.319
genuine blue blood or something?

01:04:40.890 --> 01:04:42.758
Something.

01:04:45.845 --> 01:04:47.995
You see, I'm on my way
to the Alamo Mission

01:04:48.014 --> 01:04:51.850
in San Antonio, to Bexar, to enlist.

01:04:51.851 --> 01:04:54.669
Well, I'm afraid
you're a mite late, son.

01:04:56.489 --> 01:04:58.339
Colonel Travis was
killed by the Mexicans,

01:04:58.358 --> 01:05:02.361
along with everybody else at the Alamo.

01:05:02.362 --> 01:05:03.795
Crockett?

01:05:08.201 --> 01:05:10.536
He was gonna be U.S. president someday.

01:05:10.537 --> 01:05:12.520
Yes, sir.

01:05:12.539 --> 01:05:14.472
They got the whole damn lot of them.

01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:19.510
I'm on my way to fight
alongside my brother

01:05:19.512 --> 01:05:22.196
at Fort Defiance in Goliad.

01:05:22.215 --> 01:05:23.981
Colonel Fannin's command?

01:05:25.852 --> 01:05:27.952
Reckon then I'll enlist there.

01:05:31.725 --> 01:05:34.542
Better ride with me, then, Hard Case.

01:05:34.561 --> 01:05:37.896
I don't need you waylaid
in any more gunfights.

01:05:49.659 --> 01:05:51.542
You coming or what?

01:06:13.817 --> 01:06:15.616
Come on, now.

01:06:27.947 --> 01:06:30.715
We bring you orders
from General Houston.

01:06:38.708 --> 01:06:40.709
No doubt ordering me to withdraw.

01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:42.544
I know we're in a general retreat.

01:06:42.545 --> 01:06:45.446
But the Mexican army is weeks away.

01:06:45.465 --> 01:06:47.448
Colonel, if you don't get,

01:06:47.467 --> 01:06:50.401
you and your men are
gonna be overrun and die.

01:06:53.473 --> 01:06:55.974
I'll do what my conscience
tells me to do, boy.

01:06:55.975 --> 01:06:58.360
God damn your conscience.

01:06:58.361 --> 01:06:59.862
Do what Houston tells you.

01:06:59.863 --> 01:07:02.231
You follow orders.

01:07:02.232 --> 01:07:03.649
We're with you, Colonel.

01:07:03.650 --> 01:07:05.651
Dismissed.

01:07:05.652 --> 01:07:07.403
Dismissed, gentlemen.

01:07:09.739 --> 01:07:12.006
We delivered the message.

01:07:14.911 --> 01:07:16.727
Houston...

01:07:20.366 --> 01:07:23.218
Our good wagon and our
old mare ain't here.

01:07:23.219 --> 01:07:26.255
Ma and the girls... they
must've left already.

01:07:26.256 --> 01:07:29.591
So who's that stallion belong to, then?

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:45.840
Yah. Come on.

01:08:04.711 --> 01:08:08.297
Private Knowles? What the hell?

01:08:08.298 --> 01:08:10.632
Last we heard, youse was desertin'.

01:08:10.633 --> 01:08:11.866
Now you profiteering?

01:08:11.885 --> 01:08:13.200
Well, hold up, now.

01:08:13.219 --> 01:08:15.352
I done my duty, is what I done.

01:08:15.355 --> 01:08:16.703
Alls I did is,

01:08:16.723 --> 01:08:19.390
I warned the old lady
about the Mexicans.

01:08:19.392 --> 01:08:20.893
Can't help it if she's running off

01:08:20.894 --> 01:08:23.527
all scared and leaving shit.

01:08:23.529 --> 01:08:25.564
That old lady is my mother,

01:08:25.564 --> 01:08:26.732
you despicable poltroon.

01:08:26.733 --> 01:08:28.617
You... you loot my home?

01:08:28.618 --> 01:08:30.885
Your mother?

01:08:30.904 --> 01:08:32.821
He done bamboozled your family, Truett.

01:08:32.822 --> 01:08:34.957
What are you gonna do about it?

01:08:34.957 --> 01:08:37.808
Now, just... easy, gentlemen.

01:08:38.828 --> 01:08:42.546
Well, it seems you forgot

01:08:42.549 --> 01:08:45.215
my daddy's prized bullwhip, Knowles.

01:08:45.218 --> 01:08:46.969
So I'ma give it to you.

01:08:46.970 --> 01:08:48.234
Now, now, hold on... ahh!

01:08:48.254 --> 01:08:50.339
You damn deserter, get!

01:08:58.814 --> 01:09:00.015
- Oh, what the hell?
- Yee-haw!

01:09:01.818 --> 01:09:05.903
You hoodwink anybody
else, we tie you down...

01:09:05.904 --> 01:09:06.904
Gentlemen...

01:09:06.906 --> 01:09:08.607
We pour molasses on you.

01:09:08.608 --> 01:09:11.527
We let the critters eat their fill.

01:09:11.528 --> 01:09:13.828
Now get on your horse and get.

01:09:15.365 --> 01:09:17.098
I'm going. I'm going.

01:09:26.709 --> 01:09:28.759
I showed him.

01:09:28.761 --> 01:09:32.014
Gol'darn thieving
deserter, you better get!

01:09:51.033 --> 01:09:54.468
That's good enough. Climb
out and cover them up.

01:09:54.487 --> 01:09:56.822
Not sure I agree with
your methods, General.

01:09:56.823 --> 01:09:59.456
Worked for Washington and Jackson.

01:09:59.459 --> 01:10:03.511
All right, men, stand
beside me bearing arms.

01:10:14.307 --> 01:10:17.808
I promised you men an answer.

01:10:17.810 --> 01:10:19.910
I'm now prepared to deliver it.

01:10:23.349 --> 01:10:27.903
I've ordered Colonel Fannin
to retreat from Goliad.

01:10:27.904 --> 01:10:31.607
Our armies will move east
and join forces with his,

01:10:31.608 --> 01:10:34.491
picking up volunteers along the way.

01:10:34.494 --> 01:10:38.280
This is the very kind of deliberation

01:10:38.281 --> 01:10:42.784
that lost the lives of our
compatriots at the Alamo!

01:10:42.785 --> 01:10:46.788
Sir, we lost great men in Travis

01:10:46.789 --> 01:10:51.259
and Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie himself.

01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:53.010
General,

01:10:53.012 --> 01:10:55.362
I feel it is our Christian duty

01:10:55.381 --> 01:10:57.865
to march to Goliad to fight.

01:10:57.884 --> 01:11:00.802
To defeat Santa Anna, to take

01:11:00.803 --> 01:11:04.940
our vengeance, and stand our ground

01:11:04.941 --> 01:11:07.476
with Fannin is the proper,

01:11:07.477 --> 01:11:11.813
tactically, thing to do, sir.

01:11:11.814 --> 01:11:12.981
He's right!

01:11:12.982 --> 01:11:14.698
We should fight!

01:11:14.701 --> 01:11:16.867
Yeah!

01:11:16.869 --> 01:11:18.836
Men...

01:11:26.579 --> 01:11:28.378
Colonel Fannin has his orders.

01:11:28.381 --> 01:11:30.564
You men have yours.

01:11:30.583 --> 01:11:34.885
You may question my military strategy

01:11:34.887 --> 01:11:37.839
but not my heart,

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:41.391
and if any one of you
question my command,

01:11:41.394 --> 01:11:43.944
there's a grave reserved for you.

01:11:49.435 --> 01:11:50.936
I will give you your battle.

01:11:50.937 --> 01:11:53.754
I will give you your blood.

01:11:53.773 --> 01:11:56.525
Your brothers and
friends shall be avenged,

01:11:56.526 --> 01:11:59.576
and it will be when and
where your general orders it.

01:11:59.579 --> 01:12:01.530
Now let me hear you say aye.

01:12:01.531 --> 01:12:03.597
Aye.

01:12:03.616 --> 01:12:05.834
I'm not asking a question.

01:12:05.835 --> 01:12:08.837
Answer so that God and
Santa Anna can hear it.

01:12:08.838 --> 01:12:10.872
Let me hear you say aye!

01:12:10.873 --> 01:12:12.541
Aye!

01:12:21.968 --> 01:12:23.600
Good.

01:12:23.603 --> 01:12:25.387
You are dismissed.

01:12:25.388 --> 01:12:26.821
General.

01:12:32.645 --> 01:12:33.979
Captain Baker,

01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:36.398
tearing off on some half-assed reprisal

01:12:36.399 --> 01:12:38.734
is exactly what Santa Anna wants.

01:12:38.735 --> 01:12:41.451
You insubordinate me again
in front of my troops,

01:12:41.454 --> 01:12:43.453
I'll have you shot.

01:12:52.213 --> 01:12:53.513
- Come on! Come on!
- Come on!

01:12:54.849 --> 01:12:56.182
Spurs are not that hard!

01:12:56.184 --> 01:12:57.867
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- I beat you, boy.

01:12:57.886 --> 01:12:59.535
- You didn't beat me.
- I beat you.

01:12:59.554 --> 01:13:02.038
You couldn't beat a blind dog, boy.

01:13:03.608 --> 01:13:06.110
Third time this week.

01:13:06.111 --> 01:13:07.526
Yee, boy, I done beat you!

01:13:07.529 --> 01:13:08.861
No, I beat you.

01:13:08.863 --> 01:13:10.713
I'm faster than a ring-tailed bobcat.

01:13:10.732 --> 01:13:12.399
- You seen me.
- Hell you are.

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:14.401
I was a full nose ahead,
ain't that right, Captain?

01:13:14.402 --> 01:13:16.052
- Where you off to?
- Back to camp.

01:13:16.071 --> 01:13:17.955
Fannin's a stubborn
bastard. Won't obey orders.

01:13:17.956 --> 01:13:22.126
Well, you want us to
linger and spy on him?

01:13:22.127 --> 01:13:24.495
What do you reckon, Deaf?

01:13:24.496 --> 01:13:26.497
They're wearin' their own boots.

01:13:26.498 --> 01:13:28.165
Can walk where they want to.

01:13:28.166 --> 01:13:30.549
If Fannin hasn't moved
by day after next,

01:13:30.552 --> 01:13:33.052
ride due east and meet
us there, in Victoria.

01:13:35.757 --> 01:13:39.593
And keep your eyes and ears open.

01:13:39.594 --> 01:13:40.761
And don't you tarry.

01:13:40.762 --> 01:13:42.479
You feeling poorly, Captain?

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:43.913
I'm fine, damn it.

01:13:43.932 --> 01:13:47.583
Well, we... we just
wanted to say that, well,

01:13:47.602 --> 01:13:49.486
we feel that it's the...

01:13:49.487 --> 01:13:51.655
What my jibber-jabbering
friend means to say

01:13:51.656 --> 01:13:54.090
is that we hold the two
of you in equal high regard

01:13:54.109 --> 01:13:55.541
as our own daddies.

01:13:58.613 --> 01:14:01.097
And we proud to be Texan rangers, sirs.

01:14:02.617 --> 01:14:05.551
You two may become real rangers yet.

01:14:10.842 --> 01:14:13.844
- Real rangers.
- Oh, yeah.

01:14:21.052 --> 01:14:23.053
- Help! Help us!
- Ahh, help!

01:14:28.610 --> 01:14:30.793
Help! My ankle!

01:14:30.812 --> 01:14:32.128
I can't get it off her.

01:14:32.147 --> 01:14:34.732
Keep her head above the water.

01:14:34.733 --> 01:14:36.066
Come to the back! Help lift!

01:14:36.067 --> 01:14:37.151
Flores, get in there.

01:14:37.152 --> 01:14:38.819
Get in there.

01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:41.655
She's stuck. Don't lift till I say.

01:14:41.656 --> 01:14:44.708
One, two... lift! Agh!

01:14:49.214 --> 01:14:51.597
Take a look at her.

01:15:02.093 --> 01:15:04.076
- Thank you.
- You all right, darling?

01:15:05.597 --> 01:15:06.597
Shit.

01:15:06.598 --> 01:15:08.098
Name's Rebecca Pitt.

01:15:08.099 --> 01:15:10.082
That's my brother, Colby.

01:15:11.486 --> 01:15:12.853
All right.

01:15:12.854 --> 01:15:16.023
Awful pretty name... Rebecca.

01:15:16.024 --> 01:15:17.908
Name's Kit Acklin.

01:15:17.909 --> 01:15:20.543
Me and Vern there are ridin'
with the rangering company.

01:15:23.164 --> 01:15:26.132
Well, good luck, Rebecca.

01:15:27.702 --> 01:15:30.303
All right. Let's go, boy. Come on.

01:15:37.879 --> 01:15:39.096
No, no, no.

01:15:39.097 --> 01:15:40.563
Y'all done made a hustle out...

01:15:40.582 --> 01:15:41.680
But you said two, not three.

01:15:41.683 --> 01:15:42.683
What is this?

01:15:42.684 --> 01:15:44.533
Huh? Whoa.

01:15:44.552 --> 01:15:46.436
Now, you... do you
understand what this is?

01:15:46.437 --> 01:15:47.721
Now, I told you...

01:15:47.722 --> 01:15:49.723
What's that commotion over there?

01:15:49.724 --> 01:15:52.442
Looks like that bastard's
demanding compensation

01:15:52.443 --> 01:15:54.728
from the widow woman for
helping her to ford the river.

01:15:54.729 --> 01:15:57.046
- Just gonna give you two...
- Hey, easy, easy, now.

01:15:57.065 --> 01:16:00.067
That's the private that
deserted Gonzalez three days ago.

01:16:00.068 --> 01:16:01.451
Let me just see.

01:16:01.452 --> 01:16:02.619
Let me just see.

01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:03.737
Here we go. What's that?

01:16:03.738 --> 01:16:05.871
We need to make an example.

01:16:05.874 --> 01:16:09.058
He'll do. Arrest him.

01:16:09.077 --> 01:16:10.726
We try him next halt.

01:16:14.799 --> 01:16:16.667
Hear ye! Hear ye!

01:16:16.668 --> 01:16:20.069
This military tribunal
is now in session.

01:16:20.088 --> 01:16:23.090
Prisoner that stands before this court

01:16:23.091 --> 01:16:27.594
is charged with desertion
at the time of war.

01:16:27.595 --> 01:16:32.482
Private Ephraim Knowles,
without orders or furlough,

01:16:32.483 --> 01:16:35.986
absented himself from Camp Gonzalez,

01:16:35.987 --> 01:16:37.654
which is a direct

01:16:37.655 --> 01:16:42.159
violation of his sworn military oath.

01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:46.496
No, no different from about 500 others.

01:16:46.497 --> 01:16:49.499
Private, do you have a friend
or member of this company

01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:51.750
who you'd like to speak on your behalf?

01:16:51.753 --> 01:16:53.370
Well, let's see, Your Honor.

01:16:53.371 --> 01:16:55.539
I'd have to say the
best man to speak for me

01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:59.126
would be none other than, uh, oh, me.

01:16:59.127 --> 01:17:01.128
I'll tell you why.

01:17:01.129 --> 01:17:03.513
'Cause my company ain't
nothing but a bunch

01:17:03.514 --> 01:17:06.133
of sniveling bastard weasels.

01:17:08.519 --> 01:17:12.104
Order. Very well.

01:17:12.106 --> 01:17:14.106
- Sergeant Anderson...
- Sir.

01:17:14.108 --> 01:17:15.958
I appoint you

01:17:15.959 --> 01:17:18.943
to speak on behalf of the accused.

01:17:18.962 --> 01:17:20.213
I don't know this man, sir.

01:17:20.214 --> 01:17:22.764
That may be to his advantage.

01:17:24.768 --> 01:17:26.768
Yes, sir.

01:17:26.770 --> 01:17:28.971
Private, do you stipulate
to the facts that...

01:17:28.972 --> 01:17:30.455
If I am to speak for this man,

01:17:30.474 --> 01:17:33.775
I will make the stipulations, sir.

01:17:33.777 --> 01:17:36.461
Fine.

01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:38.314
Sergeant, you are
denying that he deserted?

01:17:38.315 --> 01:17:40.816
No. I'm the one that arrested him.

01:17:40.817 --> 01:17:42.801
Sergeant, do you have anything to say

01:17:42.819 --> 01:17:45.154
on this man's behalf
before he is sentenced?

01:17:45.155 --> 01:17:47.472
No, but I do have a few questions.

01:17:47.491 --> 01:17:49.457
Carry on.

01:17:49.459 --> 01:17:51.309
- Private Knowles...
- Yes, sir.

01:17:51.328 --> 01:17:54.962
What were you doing
before I arrested you?

01:17:54.965 --> 01:17:56.749
What was I doing? I was only just...

01:17:56.750 --> 01:18:00.134
I was arguing a teensy bit
with some old widow woman.

01:18:00.137 --> 01:18:02.054
That was the same woman

01:18:02.055 --> 01:18:03.923
that you helped across the river,

01:18:03.924 --> 01:18:04.924
with the children...

01:18:04.925 --> 01:18:06.092
That's right.

01:18:06.093 --> 01:18:07.426
And their pitiful few possessions.

01:18:07.427 --> 01:18:09.143
That's right. That's right.

01:18:09.146 --> 01:18:11.479
Alls I done is, I
carried this fat old lady

01:18:11.481 --> 01:18:13.182
all the way across that damn river,

01:18:13.183 --> 01:18:15.983
and as soon as she was
safe on the other side...

01:18:15.986 --> 01:18:17.436
Where did you say you were from again?

01:18:17.437 --> 01:18:19.438
- Is it east Georgia?
- Milledgeville, Georgia.

01:18:19.439 --> 01:18:21.155
Get to the point, Sergeant.

01:18:21.158 --> 01:18:23.007
I heard a story about a man there

01:18:23.026 --> 01:18:26.177
who takes his pecker out in the store,

01:18:26.196 --> 01:18:28.030
wears no pants, walks
around in the rain,

01:18:28.031 --> 01:18:30.014
stares at the sun all afternoon...

01:18:30.033 --> 01:18:32.183
That would be Obadiah Claymore.

01:18:32.202 --> 01:18:33.369
What of him?

01:18:33.370 --> 01:18:36.170
It's just that it's an area

01:18:36.173 --> 01:18:39.858
that's known for people
marrying direct blood relations,

01:18:39.876 --> 01:18:43.796
so no more than 1 in 20 are born normal.

01:18:43.797 --> 01:18:45.012
Señor Anderson,

01:18:45.015 --> 01:18:47.181
are you saying that Private Knowles

01:18:47.183 --> 01:18:50.200
is not responsible for his
actions because he has...

01:18:50.219 --> 01:18:51.368
Yes, what I am saying is,

01:18:51.387 --> 01:18:52.853
is that there's a 1 in 20 chance

01:18:52.855 --> 01:18:54.139
that he's not right in the head.

01:18:57.810 --> 01:18:59.477
Laugh it up.

01:18:59.478 --> 01:19:03.363
Laugh it up, and damn you all to hell.

01:19:03.366 --> 01:19:06.049
I am, too, right in the head.

01:19:06.068 --> 01:19:08.737
I am righter than right in my head.

01:19:08.738 --> 01:19:10.739
But I'll tell you what ain't right.

01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:13.158
I'll tell you what's goddamn insane,

01:19:13.159 --> 01:19:15.042
it's so far from right.

01:19:15.044 --> 01:19:18.163
It would be the idea of any one of us

01:19:18.164 --> 01:19:19.497
staying in this...

01:19:19.498 --> 01:19:23.216
this joke of an army to fight and fight

01:19:23.219 --> 01:19:24.551
and lose life after life...

01:19:24.553 --> 01:19:26.069
Private, that's enough!

01:19:26.088 --> 01:19:27.237
For a goddamn lost cause.

01:19:27.256 --> 01:19:29.406
That's enough, Private.

01:19:29.425 --> 01:19:31.843
A goddamn lost cause...

01:19:31.844 --> 01:19:33.610
I'm done defending.

01:19:36.015 --> 01:19:37.898
What was the prisoner's name again?

01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:39.399
- Ephraim Knowles, sir.
- Ephraim?

01:19:39.402 --> 01:19:40.501
Yes, sir.

01:19:42.021 --> 01:19:44.522
Ephraim Knowles,

01:19:44.523 --> 01:19:49.092
for your cowardly desertion
from this army in wartime,

01:19:49.111 --> 01:19:52.781
in accordance with military
practice and precedent,

01:19:52.782 --> 01:19:55.450
this court hereby
sentences you to death.

01:19:55.451 --> 01:19:57.786
Youse...

01:19:57.787 --> 01:20:00.872
You of all people...

01:20:00.873 --> 01:20:02.207
you call me a coward.

01:20:02.208 --> 01:20:03.958
You are the coward!

01:20:03.959 --> 01:20:08.296
You let the Alamo die,
and now Fannin needs you.

01:20:08.297 --> 01:20:12.766
Ain't that the pot calling
the kettle blacker than black.

01:20:12.768 --> 01:20:16.102
- Oh!
- That'll do.

01:20:16.105 --> 01:20:19.540
Make your farewells and
prepare your soul for eternity.

01:20:21.143 --> 01:20:22.977
At first light, you will be taken

01:20:22.978 --> 01:20:26.981
before the army firing
squad, blindfolded,

01:20:26.982 --> 01:20:29.783
and shot.

01:20:29.785 --> 01:20:31.486
May God have mercy on you.

01:20:31.487 --> 01:20:34.038
Court's adjourned.

01:20:34.039 --> 01:20:36.139
Remove the prisoner.

01:20:44.049 --> 01:20:45.383
Now that the message has been sent,

01:20:45.384 --> 01:20:46.918
if he were to escape by morning,

01:20:46.919 --> 01:20:48.986
I wouldn't view it as a calamity.

01:20:49.004 --> 01:20:50.054
Yes, sir.

01:20:50.055 --> 01:20:51.488
Get up.

01:20:56.761 --> 01:20:59.629
No. Eliza, no.

01:20:59.631 --> 01:21:03.132
Don't say that. Oh...

01:21:03.135 --> 01:21:06.487
No, no...

01:21:09.491 --> 01:21:11.257
No!

01:21:41.323 --> 01:21:43.423
I don't drink when I'm at war.

01:21:43.442 --> 01:21:45.276
It's medicinal.

01:21:45.277 --> 01:21:47.043
It helps me sleep.

01:21:51.533 --> 01:21:54.250
How long you been sitting there?

01:21:54.253 --> 01:21:56.052
Long enough.

01:21:59.625 --> 01:22:01.008
You gonna give me a stallion,

01:22:01.009 --> 01:22:04.011
or do I have to steal one?

01:22:06.181 --> 01:22:09.467
Emily, Emily, Emily,

01:22:09.468 --> 01:22:13.020
now, how can I, in good conscience,

01:22:13.021 --> 01:22:17.358
allow you to put yourself
in harm's way again?

01:22:17.359 --> 01:22:21.696
Why do you think I'd do such a thing?

01:22:21.697 --> 01:22:24.164
'Cause you want revenge
for your brother.

01:22:26.652 --> 01:22:28.635
What you care what I want?

01:23:00.068 --> 01:23:02.669
Are you still havin'
that same nightmare?

01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:07.207
This isn't Basin Street.

01:23:09.361 --> 01:23:11.511
Persuasions received
there are not welcome here.

01:23:11.530 --> 01:23:13.030
Persuasions?

01:23:13.031 --> 01:23:15.065
As I recall, what we
did tween the sheets

01:23:15.067 --> 01:23:17.767
wasn't called "persuasions."

01:23:23.542 --> 01:23:25.809
The dream haunts me still.

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:32.549
When we were together in New Orleans,

01:23:32.551 --> 01:23:36.419
I only had the nightmare one time.

01:23:36.421 --> 01:23:39.155
You ain't taking care of that wound.

01:23:41.994 --> 01:23:44.461
Doctors tell me it's
unlikely it'll ever heal.

01:23:44.463 --> 01:23:47.264
I'm not talking about
the hole in your shoulder.

01:24:01.129 --> 01:24:04.230
"Marriage has spoiled
Daddy's Southern belle."

01:24:06.418 --> 01:24:09.519
Those hateful words were
meant to torment you.

01:24:13.425 --> 01:24:17.077
She done more harm to you
than all your battles combined.

01:24:19.181 --> 01:24:22.350
She was terrified,

01:24:22.351 --> 01:24:24.685
just a child,

01:24:24.686 --> 01:24:27.570
afraid of a man

01:24:27.573 --> 01:24:29.539
who needed a grown woman.

01:24:31.610 --> 01:24:33.593
Look at me, Sam.

01:24:37.416 --> 01:24:40.216
Your baby bride was scared.

01:24:41.753 --> 01:24:44.539
I'm not scared.

01:24:44.540 --> 01:24:46.189
You scared?

01:24:49.211 --> 01:24:52.213
You need medication 'cause
you're alone with me?

01:25:06.562 --> 01:25:09.295
Put your arms around me, Sam.

01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:17.303
Touch me.

01:27:39.297 --> 01:27:40.631
The hell?

01:27:40.632 --> 01:27:42.349
I told you.

01:27:42.350 --> 01:27:44.969
There's no time to
dillydally, sleepyhead.

01:27:44.970 --> 01:27:48.472
Got to report back to Captain Deaf.

01:27:48.473 --> 01:27:50.524
They're waiting on us.

01:28:04.122 --> 01:28:05.972
Hey, want to race?

01:28:05.991 --> 01:28:07.456
- Nah, will you...
- Keep up, boy!

01:28:07.459 --> 01:28:09.142
Oh, come on!

01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:18.002
Whoo-hoo! Think you can beat me, huh?

01:28:18.003 --> 01:28:20.503
With both hands tied behind my back!

01:28:20.505 --> 01:28:23.489
- Why you so slow?
- Hoo-hoo-hoo!

01:28:23.508 --> 01:28:25.491
Whoo!

01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:29.263
Ah-hey! How does it smell back there?

01:28:35.070 --> 01:28:38.154
- Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- Whoo!

01:28:38.156 --> 01:28:39.488
- Yes!
- Oh, you son of a...

01:28:39.491 --> 01:28:41.358
Get out of my way.

01:28:41.359 --> 01:28:43.009
- Yee-haw!
- Whoo!

01:28:43.028 --> 01:28:44.695
You like the look of that tail, boy?

01:28:47.249 --> 01:28:48.664
Come on. Yah.

01:28:51.336 --> 01:28:53.336
You're the one smelling my horse's ass.

01:28:53.338 --> 01:28:55.671
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- Whoo!

01:28:55.674 --> 01:28:57.357
- Come on!
- Slowpoke!

01:28:59.544 --> 01:29:01.962
All right!

01:29:12.474 --> 01:29:14.058
- Whoa.
- Oh, my God.

01:29:14.059 --> 01:29:15.524
That's General Urrea.

01:29:15.527 --> 01:29:17.026
I thought he was days away.

01:29:18.230 --> 01:29:20.231
Holy shit. We got to warn Fannin.

01:29:22.150 --> 01:29:23.651
Come on!

01:29:25.737 --> 01:29:27.136
Cease fire!

01:29:27.139 --> 01:29:29.657
Let them go!

01:29:29.658 --> 01:29:31.992
They will warn the rebels.

01:29:31.993 --> 01:29:34.328
Fear makes men foolish and rash.

01:29:34.329 --> 01:29:35.496
Ready the troops for attack.

01:29:35.497 --> 01:29:37.213
Prepare tus armas!

01:29:37.894 --> 01:29:43.829
