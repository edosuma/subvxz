00:00.010 --> 00:00.810
<i>Previously, on The Fosters.</i>

00:00.844 --> 00:04.043
So, any idea when you guys might decide

00:04.064 --> 00:05.164
if I can go on tour this summer?

00:05.198 --> 00:06.265
Yes, you can go.

00:06.299 --> 00:07.967
My parents want us to stay in motels,

00:08.000 --> 00:09.902
or they won't let us go.

00:09.936 --> 00:10.903
Won't let you go.

00:10.937 --> 00:12.905
Mariana came to see me yesterday.

00:12.939 --> 00:16.709
She thought I should ask
you to adopt the baby.

00:16.743 --> 00:17.910
And I think it's a good idea.

00:17.944 --> 00:19.845
Have you heard anything about Tasha?

00:19.880 --> 00:21.780
I get my first supervised
visit on Saturday.

00:21.815 --> 00:24.016
What? Why didn't you tell me?

00:24.050 --> 00:25.951
- Last time I seen her...
- She won't remember that.

00:25.986 --> 00:27.791
<i>[Daphne] What if she remembers being scared</i>

00:27.792 --> 00:28.792
'cause some stranger took her?

00:28.922 --> 00:31.457
Callie, can we ask you a few questions?

00:31.491 --> 00:32.124
What about?

00:32.158 --> 00:33.559
Do you remember buying this?

00:33.593 --> 00:35.594
[woman] Because the salesperson
remembers selling it to you.

00:35.629 --> 00:37.663
- Is that a crime?
- No, but kidnapping is.

00:37.697 --> 00:39.972
<i>I'm 16. Aren't I allowed to have a</i>

00:39.973 --> 00:41.710
parent here when you ask me questions?

00:41.715 --> 00:44.470
I'm Robert Quinn. I'm Callie's father.

00:47.607 --> 00:49.441
Look, Callie, it was Christmas.

00:49.476 --> 00:52.278
Your friend, Daphne, just
wasn't thinking straight.

00:52.312 --> 00:54.513
She missed her baby.
She saw an opportunity,

00:54.547 --> 00:56.148
and she took her.

00:56.182 --> 00:58.350
I might've done the same
thing if that was my kid.

00:58.385 --> 01:01.053
That's a sad story, but what
does it have to do with my client?

01:01.087 --> 01:03.088
Kidnapping is a very serious crime.

01:03.123 --> 01:05.858
Now, we don't think your client
had anything to do with it,

01:05.892 --> 01:08.827
but obstructing justice is also serious.

01:08.862 --> 01:10.763
Do you have any actual
questions for Callie?

01:10.797 --> 01:12.932
Honey, we understand you
want to protect your friend.

01:12.966 --> 01:14.800
But what about that little girl?

01:14.834 --> 01:17.636
How scared she must have
been being taken from the park

01:17.671 --> 01:18.737
by a stranger.

01:18.772 --> 01:20.739
Look, all you have to
do is tell us the truth.

01:20.774 --> 01:22.875
You gave Daphne this wind-up
toy that Tasha was holding

01:22.909 --> 01:24.576
when she was returned.

01:24.611 --> 01:25.744
Isn't that right?

01:25.779 --> 01:27.646
Or maybe you really were involved.

01:27.681 --> 01:28.614
Maybe you helped.

01:28.648 --> 01:30.382
That's why you don't want to talk.

01:30.417 --> 01:31.583
OK, enough.

01:31.618 --> 01:33.419
Are you seriously trying
to connect my client

01:33.453 --> 01:36.555
with an alleged crime through
a Tito the Chihuahua toy?

01:36.589 --> 01:38.290
How many of those things
do you think are out there?

01:38.325 --> 01:39.325
A few hundred thousand?

01:39.359 --> 01:41.393
But only one was sold at this store.

01:41.428 --> 01:42.561
- And she bought it.
- Says who?

01:42.595 --> 01:45.264
Says the salesperson that
sold it to you, Callie.

01:45.298 --> 01:47.232
The same day Tasha was kidnapped.

01:47.267 --> 01:50.302
- You got a receipt?
- Look, we asked a question.

01:50.337 --> 01:52.304
Why don't you just let your client answer?

01:52.339 --> 01:54.373
Because you're flying blind here.

01:54.407 --> 01:57.209
All you've got is a wind-up
toy and a far-out theory.

01:57.243 --> 01:58.277
We're done here.

02:01.247 --> 02:03.816
Yeah, this is good, I'll walk from here.

02:06.019 --> 02:07.119
Thank you for coming.

02:09.021 --> 02:10.856
Yeah, no, I'm... I'm glad you called.

02:10.889 --> 02:12.825
I would've called Stef and Lena, but...

02:12.859 --> 02:14.860
But, Callie, if you're
just protecting Daphne...

02:14.894 --> 02:16.695
I'm not just protecting her.

02:18.932 --> 02:21.600
OK, then you do exactly
what the lawyer told you.

02:21.634 --> 02:24.703
They can't prove that you bought that
toy or that you gave it to Daphne.

02:24.738 --> 02:26.672
The only way they can connect
you to what happened...

02:26.706 --> 02:28.574
Is if I talk, I know.

02:28.608 --> 02:29.703
You can't tell anyone,

02:29.704 --> 02:32.970
even me, anything that
could get you in trouble.

02:32.972 --> 02:34.480
And I don't want you
talking to Daphne about this.

02:34.514 --> 02:35.481
Or any one else.

02:35.515 --> 02:37.416
This is a very serious crime.

02:37.450 --> 02:39.551
Anyone involved with this in any way

02:39.586 --> 02:41.120
could go to jail.

02:41.154 --> 02:42.488
And Stef, you know, she's a police officer.

02:42.522 --> 02:43.489
She can't protect you,

02:43.523 --> 02:44.490
not without risking her own career.

02:44.524 --> 02:46.291
I know. That's why I didn't call her.

02:49.029 --> 02:51.296
Look, it's gonna be OK.

02:51.331 --> 02:56.935
You call me if the police try to
question you or if you need anything.

02:56.970 --> 02:59.772
I'm gonna take care of this.

02:59.806 --> 03:01.974
And you. OK?

03:05.111 --> 03:06.078
OK.

04:04.504 --> 04:05.604
Hey.

04:05.638 --> 04:06.772
Wait a minute.

04:06.806 --> 04:09.575
What do you have to say
for yourself, young lady?

04:09.609 --> 04:10.676
Huh?

04:10.710 --> 04:12.644
Getting up at 6:00 AM on
a Saturday to go to work.

04:12.679 --> 04:14.513
Impressive.

04:14.547 --> 04:17.716
Oh, well, I'm volunteering
at the drop-in center later

04:17.750 --> 04:19.551
so I had to pick up the breakfast shift.

04:19.586 --> 04:21.786
Oh, yeah, they do a big
breakfast hamburger business?

04:21.821 --> 04:23.922
Yeah, like, eggs and stuff.

04:23.957 --> 04:24.923
You all right?

04:24.958 --> 04:26.725
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just tired.

04:26.759 --> 04:28.494
Well, don't run yourself ragged, honey.

04:28.528 --> 04:29.895
You can always cancel
your shift at the center.

04:29.929 --> 04:31.663
No, no, I'm fine.

04:31.698 --> 04:32.898
They need the help, trust me.

04:32.932 --> 04:36.869
Oh, uh, Daphne's here. I almost forgot.

04:36.903 --> 04:37.970
Daphne's here?

04:38.004 --> 04:40.839
Yeah, we told her she
could wait in your room.

04:40.874 --> 04:43.542
Mm, thanks.

04:49.582 --> 04:50.916
Hey. Everything OK?

04:50.950 --> 04:52.718
No.

04:57.624 --> 04:58.824
I don't have anything to wear.

05:02.929 --> 05:06.832
Wait... farm party?
Like haystacks and stuff?

05:06.866 --> 05:08.834
[laughing] No, dude.

05:08.868 --> 05:12.738
It's, like, pharm, p-h-a-r-m.

05:13.973 --> 05:16.742
Admission is $10 cash
plus a prescription pill,

05:16.776 --> 05:19.511
which they toss into a
big bowl and pass around.

05:19.546 --> 05:23.615
So wait... people just take
whatever pill they pick,

05:23.650 --> 05:25.884
without even knowing what it is?

05:25.919 --> 05:27.853
That's beyond stupid...

05:27.887 --> 05:30.789
I mean, we don't have to
do it. We just have to play.

05:30.823 --> 05:33.725
Do you wanna go on tour or not?

05:33.760 --> 05:35.801
I mean, you could end up making a lot more

05:35.802 --> 05:37.346
than the $200 we're guaranteed

05:37.464 --> 05:38.597
if there's a big turnout.

05:38.631 --> 05:39.798
What do you mean, "I could?"

05:39.832 --> 05:42.968
- We're giving you the money.
- All of it?

05:43.002 --> 05:45.737
All of it. It was Lou's idea.

05:45.772 --> 05:46.939
Really?

05:49.776 --> 05:50.876
Wow.

05:50.910 --> 05:52.778
OK, thanks.

05:54.714 --> 05:57.549
But I don't want Mariana coming, OK?

05:57.584 --> 05:58.617
Just in case.

05:58.651 --> 06:01.753
Are you gonna be the one
to tell her she can't come?

06:01.788 --> 06:03.388
'Cause I'm not.

06:03.423 --> 06:06.491
- I'm not afraid of Mariana.
- You should be.

06:07.660 --> 06:09.494
I think of it as a healthy fear.

06:09.529 --> 06:12.497
She has a way of getting what she wants.

06:15.235 --> 06:16.301
Did she talk to you about the tour yet?

06:16.336 --> 06:17.536
What about it?

06:20.240 --> 06:23.075
You told Ana that she should
ask us to adopt her baby?

06:24.077 --> 06:25.143
No.

06:26.913 --> 06:29.314
I mean, yeah, kinda.

06:29.349 --> 06:30.816
Was she mad?

06:31.918 --> 06:33.118
- What?
- She wasn't mad.

06:33.152 --> 06:35.921
She actually agreed with you, Mariana.

06:35.955 --> 06:39.925
- She asked us to take the baby.
- She did?

06:39.959 --> 06:42.628
Oh, my God. You guys, this
was totally meant to be.

06:42.662 --> 06:46.665
- I mean, we lost Frankie...
- Whoa, whoa. Slow down.

06:46.699 --> 06:47.933
We haven't made any decisions yet.

06:47.967 --> 06:49.501
What do you mean?

06:49.535 --> 06:51.503
We'd be saving this baby
from a terrible life.

06:51.537 --> 06:53.438
We don't know that, love, we don't.

06:53.473 --> 06:56.408
You said yourself that Ana has
no business taking care of a baby

06:56.442 --> 06:57.643
when she can't even care for herself.

06:57.677 --> 07:00.479
This is a huge commitment, honey.

07:00.513 --> 07:02.138
And your mom and I need to talk about this

07:02.139 --> 07:03.139
before we make any decisions. OK?

07:03.449 --> 07:05.117
OK.

07:08.421 --> 07:11.023
You know, I don't get it.
You took Jude and Callie in.

07:11.057 --> 07:15.227
And this baby, she's my sister.

07:20.133 --> 07:21.833
Ouch.

07:21.894 --> 07:24.829
You know, I wonder if Ana's
talked to Mike about this.

07:24.863 --> 07:26.998
He's gonna lose it.

07:27.032 --> 07:28.555
He's been working overtime
trying to convince her

07:28.556 --> 07:30.861
that she can stay clean and do this.

07:30.969 --> 07:32.804
Exactly.

07:32.838 --> 07:34.706
She's probably just gonna
change her mind anyway.

07:34.740 --> 07:36.140
Yeah, but what if she doesn't?

07:36.175 --> 07:38.876
What are we gonna tell the twins then?

07:38.911 --> 07:41.646
We tell them we have to do
what's right for the whole family.

07:41.680 --> 07:43.815
You wanted a baby.

07:43.849 --> 07:46.617
I didn't just want a baby, honey.

07:46.652 --> 07:51.422
I wanted the experience of
being pregnant, of giving birth.

07:51.457 --> 07:52.724
And as horrible as I feel saying it,

07:52.758 --> 07:55.693
I wanted a child that was
biologically a part of me.

07:55.728 --> 07:57.562
That's not horrible.

07:57.596 --> 07:59.430
It's not that I would
have loved Frankie more,

07:59.465 --> 08:03.568
I just... I wanted what
you have, all of it.

08:03.602 --> 08:06.137
Foster, adopted, and biological children.

08:06.171 --> 08:07.405
I understand.

08:07.439 --> 08:09.474
I know you don't think I can, but I do.

08:09.508 --> 08:11.042
It's just not the way it happened.

08:11.076 --> 08:13.044
And maybe whatever it is
that controls our destiny,

08:13.078 --> 08:15.313
you know, whether it's
fate or God... or whatever.

08:15.347 --> 08:20.151
Maybe... maybe it's just opened a
different door for us to walk through.

08:22.087 --> 08:24.756
Nothing too... white lady goes to brunch.

08:24.790 --> 08:27.925
I want to look like me,
just like the nice me.

08:27.960 --> 08:29.761
Why don't you just wear
what you're wearing?

08:29.795 --> 08:30.862
You look fine.

08:30.896 --> 08:32.929
It's not like Tasha's going to care.

08:32.965 --> 08:33.998
It's my first visitation.

08:34.032 --> 08:35.933
I just want it to be perfect.

08:38.604 --> 08:39.770
What about that?

08:40.839 --> 08:41.905
Really?

08:41.940 --> 08:43.674
Yeah.

08:48.881 --> 08:50.648
It's gonna be fine.

08:50.682 --> 08:53.351
You know, Tasha's just gonna
be excited to see her mom.

08:57.489 --> 08:59.116
She's not gonna recognize me as the lady

08:59.117 --> 09:00.117
that took her from the park now.

09:02.194 --> 09:03.461
Will she?

09:03.495 --> 09:07.165
No. No way.

09:13.588 --> 09:16.723
Flintwood has one of the best
athletic programs in the country.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.658
Wrestling, for example.

09:18.693 --> 09:20.045
We've been national champions

09:20.046 --> 09:21.779
in our division three
of the last four years.

09:21.802 --> 09:23.697
Just three? Slackers.

09:25.666 --> 09:29.703
All right. Well, we also
offer top notch academics.

09:29.737 --> 09:31.504
The best education money can buy.

09:32.440 --> 09:34.374
It sounds cool, really cool.

09:34.408 --> 09:38.211
I'm not gonna sugar coat it,
school's not really my thing.

09:38.246 --> 09:40.313
Look, a lot of our students
have those challenges.

09:40.348 --> 09:42.482
And this is where being an all-boys
school can really be helpful.

09:42.516 --> 09:44.484
There aren't any distractions.

09:44.518 --> 09:47.387
But I like distractions.
Especially girl ones.

09:47.421 --> 09:51.124
Don't worry, there'll be
plenty of time to socialize.

09:51.158 --> 09:54.094
But we've tailored the curriculum
to the ways boys learn best.

09:54.128 --> 09:56.897
Which is, you know, not necessarily
sitting still inside a classroom.

09:56.931 --> 09:58.298
We take an active approach

09:58.332 --> 10:01.902
with an emphasis on
sports, and camaraderie.

10:01.936 --> 10:04.070
Kinda like the military.

10:04.105 --> 10:05.171
Have you thought about college?

10:05.206 --> 10:06.907
I've thought about how
embarrassing it's going to be

10:06.941 --> 10:09.776
when everyone gets in... and I don't.

10:09.810 --> 10:10.626
That's not gonna happen,

10:10.627 --> 10:12.972
not if you treat Flintwood
the way you treat wrestling.

10:13.948 --> 10:15.749
You worked hard and it paid off.

10:15.783 --> 10:17.083
You went from being a promising wrestler

10:17.118 --> 10:19.653
to one who is being recruited
by a prestigious school.

10:19.687 --> 10:20.887
You did that.

10:20.922 --> 10:24.824
Even if I wanted to check it
out, my moms couldn't afford it.

10:24.859 --> 10:27.727
We have a big family and I'm an eater.

10:27.762 --> 10:30.463
That wouldn't be an issue.

10:30.498 --> 10:31.631
I'm offering you a scholarship.

10:31.666 --> 10:34.401
- You mean it'd be free?
- [chuckles] Yes.

10:45.346 --> 10:46.313
Whoa.

10:46.347 --> 10:47.480
When did that happen?

10:47.515 --> 10:49.482
When I went to the eye doctor
and couldn't read the chart.

10:49.517 --> 10:51.384
So, what, you wear glasses now?

10:51.419 --> 10:53.420
No. You will never see me wear glasses.

10:53.454 --> 10:55.088
No one will ever see me wear glasses.

10:55.122 --> 10:57.424
I just need to figure out these contacts.

10:57.458 --> 10:59.159
I don't think I can watch.

10:59.193 --> 11:01.294
I know.

11:01.329 --> 11:03.263
It's making me nauseous.

11:03.297 --> 11:05.265
Speaking of things that make me nauseous,

11:05.299 --> 11:08.001
Mat said you want to come on tour with us.

11:08.035 --> 11:09.836
No way. That's not happening.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.972
OK.

11:12.006 --> 11:13.974
What... I'm sorry, what? What's OK?

11:14.008 --> 11:15.075
You're allowed to have your opinion.

11:15.109 --> 11:17.811
But it's not really your
decision to make, it's Moms.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.946
Come on, Mariana. We're
not bringing girlfriends.

11:19.981 --> 11:21.047
You're bringing yours.

11:21.082 --> 11:22.649
Yeah, she's in the band!

11:22.683 --> 11:24.584
Look, I'm prepared to do my part.

11:24.618 --> 11:27.654
I'm gonna sell merch and
help with bookings and stuff.

11:27.688 --> 11:28.621
I'll be like your manager.

11:28.656 --> 11:29.990
OK. There's still no way in hell

11:30.024 --> 11:31.791
Moms are going to let you go.
I mean, they're barely letting

11:31.826 --> 11:33.860
me go and that's only if
I raise all this money.

11:33.894 --> 11:37.764
- Which I can help you with.
- How?

11:37.798 --> 11:40.433
[Mariana] Oh, look.
We're already up to 150.

11:40.468 --> 11:42.702
[Brandon] That's cool.
That's really cool, actually.

11:44.438 --> 11:46.673
But I still don't think
Moms gonna let you go.

11:46.707 --> 11:49.242
Why? Because I'm a girl?

11:49.276 --> 11:50.577
That's a total double standard.
Our moms are feminists.

11:50.611 --> 11:53.246
No, because you're 15, Mariana.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.315
Oh, please you're not even
a whole year older than me.

11:55.349 --> 11:57.350
And don't be so sure I can't convince them.

11:57.385 --> 11:59.185
I'm gonna tell them I'm
gonna keep an eye on you.

11:59.220 --> 12:01.354
Maybe I don't want the responsibility
of keeping my eye on you.

12:01.389 --> 12:03.256
Which is what I'm going to tell them.

12:03.290 --> 12:05.158
And speaking of which, I don't think
you should go to the gig tonight.

12:05.192 --> 12:06.960
OK, it's gonna be a rough crowd.

12:06.994 --> 12:09.195
Brandon, that's very sweet,

12:09.230 --> 12:12.132
but if it's too scary for me to go,

12:12.166 --> 12:15.268
well, I should probably
warn Moms about it, right?

12:15.302 --> 12:18.905
I mean, do you think they want you
playing in front of a "rough crowd?"

12:20.741 --> 12:21.841
Glad we had this talk though.

12:21.876 --> 12:27.080
I'll see you tonight!

12:27.114 --> 12:28.715
[exhales]

12:30.084 --> 12:33.019
[indistinct chatter]

12:33.788 --> 12:34.988
Jimmy.

12:38.592 --> 12:40.593
Hey, can you cover the desk for me?

12:40.628 --> 12:42.629
Yeah, sure. Hey, is that
your friend, right there?

12:42.663 --> 12:43.830
The one who's having her visitation today?

12:43.864 --> 12:44.664
Yeah.

12:44.698 --> 12:46.433
Cool. Tell her good luck.

12:46.467 --> 12:47.500
Thanks.

12:48.736 --> 12:52.238
Hey. You look nice.

12:52.273 --> 12:53.606
This is a mistake.

12:53.641 --> 12:55.575
She's... she's gonna remember me.

12:55.609 --> 12:56.476
Why was I so stupid?

12:56.510 --> 12:58.178
Daphne, listen to me.

12:58.212 --> 12:59.612
Everything is gonna be fine.

12:59.647 --> 13:02.482
But you have to stop we can never
talk about that ever again, OK?

13:03.584 --> 13:05.151
[door opens]

13:07.221 --> 13:09.122
Look who's here.

13:09.156 --> 13:10.323
Can you say, "Hi"?

13:15.162 --> 13:16.329
Can I give her a hug?

13:30.945 --> 13:32.946
So, Jesus is going to the movies,

13:32.980 --> 13:36.916
Brandon's band is playing and Jude
is going on another "group date",

13:36.951 --> 13:39.619
so, looks like we're on our own tonight.

13:39.653 --> 13:40.954
Really? Home alone.

13:40.988 --> 13:42.789
What ever will we do?

13:42.823 --> 13:45.592
We could order in. How about Mexican?

13:45.626 --> 13:48.728
Yeah, we could do Mexican,
but it's awfully... filling.

13:48.762 --> 13:50.497
- Uh, Thai?
- Spicy.

13:50.531 --> 13:53.833
- You love spicy.
- Spicy's not sexy.

13:53.868 --> 13:55.568
[laughs]

13:55.603 --> 13:57.437
You think you're getting laid tonight?

13:57.471 --> 13:59.339
Well, it has been a while.

13:59.373 --> 14:01.508
I didn't know we were keeping track.

14:01.542 --> 14:02.675
I'm not keeping track.

14:02.710 --> 14:05.345
- It's just...
- It hasn't just been me.

14:05.379 --> 14:06.546
I know. It's both of us.

14:06.580 --> 14:09.549
So... you wanna... ?

14:09.583 --> 14:13.219
Yeah, sure, I mean, how often do
we get the house all to ourselves?

14:13.254 --> 14:15.088
We gotta take advantage of it, right?

14:15.122 --> 14:17.056
Absolutely. So...

14:17.091 --> 14:19.993
- Wine? Oh, please.
- Get the good stuff.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.031
[knocking]

14:26.133 --> 14:27.867
I came by to help you load up.

14:27.902 --> 14:29.857
Thanks, but Mat was here a while ago,

14:29.858 --> 14:30.858
and I think we took care of it.

14:31.005 --> 14:32.071
Sweet.

14:32.106 --> 14:34.040
All the credit, none of the work.

14:36.210 --> 14:38.178
Hey, thanks for giving me the door tonight.

14:38.212 --> 14:40.780
Mat said it was your idea.

14:40.814 --> 14:42.949
I'm sorry I wasn't being more supportive.

14:44.151 --> 14:45.752
I really don't wanna go without you.

14:45.786 --> 14:47.720
I don't want that either.

14:48.722 --> 14:52.792
But I thought about it and you have to.

14:54.495 --> 14:55.762
If I can't go, I mean.

14:55.796 --> 14:58.798
And, I mean, don't worry, I get it.

14:58.832 --> 15:02.335
You've worked so hard for this.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.337
You have to do it, OK, no matter what.

15:12.379 --> 15:14.447
Careful. I don't want to mess up my look.

15:14.481 --> 15:16.482
Do I... ? How do I look? Am I OK?

15:16.517 --> 15:18.184
[laughs] OK, let's go.

15:18.219 --> 15:19.185
- Yes.
- OK.

15:19.220 --> 15:21.487
- You wanna do a bigger one?
- Yes...

15:25.359 --> 15:26.426
So how long have you been in?

15:27.428 --> 15:28.428
Foster care, I mean.

15:28.462 --> 15:30.029
Six years.

15:30.064 --> 15:31.397
Wow.

15:31.432 --> 15:34.100
I was in for eight.

15:34.134 --> 15:38.871
My dad took off and my
mom was... is mentally ill.

15:38.906 --> 15:41.007
- You were a foster kid?
- Oh, yeah.

15:41.041 --> 15:44.277
Coulda used a place like this
back then, that's for sure.

15:45.279 --> 15:46.980
It sucked, but, you know,

15:47.014 --> 15:51.684
it inspired me to go to grad
school, become a social worker.

15:51.719 --> 15:52.885
Right some wrongs, maybe.

15:52.920 --> 15:55.588
You know?

15:55.623 --> 15:57.824
Did you ever find a permanent placement?

15:57.858 --> 16:02.962
No, no, I ended up living in
a group home until I aged out.

16:02.997 --> 16:04.764
How about you?

16:04.798 --> 16:06.532
How's the home you're in now?

16:06.567 --> 16:07.900
I love the family I live with.

16:07.935 --> 16:09.736
They even adopted my brother.

16:09.770 --> 16:12.805
Oh. But not you?

16:12.840 --> 16:14.440
[woman] I know you took her!

16:14.475 --> 16:18.344
Go on! Play with her. Play
with her like nothing happened!

16:18.379 --> 16:20.513
You may have everybody
else fooled, but I know!

16:20.547 --> 16:21.648
- Wendy, Wendy...
- I know what you did!

16:21.682 --> 16:23.349
This isn't appropriate.

16:23.384 --> 16:24.317
I saw you!

16:24.351 --> 16:26.419
I've seen you before at the park!

16:26.453 --> 16:27.487
I know you took her!

16:27.521 --> 16:29.222
I know you took my baby!

16:29.256 --> 16:30.590
You need to leave. You
are not allowed to be here.

16:30.624 --> 16:32.253
- But she is?
- Ma'am, that's enough.

16:32.254 --> 16:33.254
You need to leave. Now.

16:33.360 --> 16:36.329
- I'm so sorry, Ms. Keene...
- Don't apologize to her, she's a criminal.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.364
You might have them
fooled, but I know better.

16:38.399 --> 16:41.301
And believe me, I'm gonna make damn
sure the police figure it out, too.

16:41.335 --> 16:45.038
There's no way I'm letting
that baby girl go back to you.

16:45.072 --> 16:46.005
Tasha belongs with us.

16:46.040 --> 16:47.240
You can't do that. She's my baby!

16:47.274 --> 16:50.109
Mommy!

16:51.147 --> 16:52.464
Hi, sweetheart.

16:54.165 --> 16:55.932
You need to hand Tasha
back to me and leave.

16:56.083 --> 16:58.885
I will bring her back to
you at the end of the visit.

17:03.891 --> 17:05.057
Shh.

17:05.092 --> 17:08.828
It's OK. I'm gonna see you
back at home in just a bit, OK?

17:13.800 --> 17:15.468
Be good, baby.

17:17.771 --> 17:21.807
If you care about Tasha, if
you really care about her,

17:21.842 --> 17:24.644
you should let her go.

17:29.683 --> 17:32.518
It's OK. It's OK.

17:51.672 --> 17:53.639
Hi. I'm with, Someone's Little Sister.

17:53.674 --> 17:56.676
Good for you. Whose Little Sister?

17:56.710 --> 17:57.877
The band. I'm with the band.

17:57.911 --> 18:00.546
Who isn't? Where's your cover?

18:00.581 --> 18:03.549
Seriously?

18:03.584 --> 18:04.617
Fine.

18:07.454 --> 18:08.621
And where's the rest of it?

18:09.790 --> 18:11.591
A pill. You need a pill.

18:11.625 --> 18:13.693
Dude, dude, she's with the band.

18:16.330 --> 18:17.712
What, so, as long as a guy
tells you I'm with the band,

18:17.713 --> 18:18.713
then you believe me?

18:20.634 --> 18:23.402
Please don't get into a
fight with the bouncer.

18:23.437 --> 18:26.372
What's with the pills? I
thought it was a farm party?

18:26.406 --> 18:28.274
Like barn animals.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.209
I wore denim.

18:30.243 --> 18:32.378
[rock music playing loudly]

18:32.412 --> 18:35.214
[lyrics continue indistinct]

19:14.820 --> 19:15.753
This crowd is huge.

19:15.787 --> 19:17.588
We could make some real money tonight.

19:18.523 --> 19:19.723
No, I'm good.

19:19.758 --> 19:20.891
What're you doing?

19:20.926 --> 19:23.427
Having fun. Relax.

19:30.802 --> 19:33.671
Callie, what was all that. I don't get it.

19:33.705 --> 19:36.507
If Tasha's foster mom is screaming at
the police, telling 'em I took Tasha,

19:36.541 --> 19:37.474
how come they ain't ever questioned me?

19:37.509 --> 19:38.509
They don't have any proof.

19:38.543 --> 19:39.643
You don't know that.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.278
Maybe they have something
and they're just waitin'.

19:41.313 --> 19:42.580
Maybe I should get outta town or somethin'.

19:42.614 --> 19:44.515
No, Daphne, stop, you don't have to run.

19:47.485 --> 19:50.454
I know they don't have any evidence

19:50.488 --> 19:53.991
because they came to the burger
stand this morning to question me.

19:54.025 --> 19:55.459
Why the hell you ain't tell me?

19:55.493 --> 19:57.194
'Cause Robert's lawyer told me told me
I couldn't say anything, even to you.

19:57.229 --> 19:58.395
OK, I was trying to protect you.

19:58.430 --> 20:01.232
- I didn't ask you to do that.
- I know.

20:01.266 --> 20:03.133
How'd they know to come to you
if they ain't got no evidence?

20:03.168 --> 20:07.104
You remember the toy,
wind-up dog I gave you?

20:07.138 --> 20:09.840
You gave it to Tasha, right?

20:10.876 --> 20:13.010
So they traced it back to the store

20:13.044 --> 20:14.979
where I bought it and the clerk ID'd me.

20:15.013 --> 20:16.814
- What?
- Yeah, but it's cool though.

20:16.848 --> 20:18.983
'Cause they can't prove
that I gave it to you.

20:19.017 --> 20:20.684
I think the cops probably came to me

20:20.719 --> 20:22.786
thinking that I would tell you

20:22.821 --> 20:25.623
and that you would panic
and do something stupid,

20:25.657 --> 20:26.757
but you're not going to, right?

20:26.791 --> 20:28.826
You're going to stay calm. Hey.

20:28.860 --> 20:31.662
I don't know if I could do that.

20:31.696 --> 20:33.664
You know me, Callie. Staying
cool is not my strength.

20:33.698 --> 20:36.834
Well, you have to. All
right, if not for you, for me.

20:36.868 --> 20:38.769
Hey, and for Brandon.

20:38.803 --> 20:41.438
And Tasha. OK?

20:49.214 --> 20:51.515
[rock music playing]

21:02.027 --> 21:05.930
Hey, did you know this
is a "p-h-a-r-m" party?

21:05.964 --> 21:07.097
I didn't even know that was a thing.

21:07.132 --> 21:09.233
Yeah, that's why I didn't want you to come.

21:09.267 --> 21:12.202
Are you... you're not gonna
take anything, are you?

21:12.237 --> 21:14.238
- No! That'd be...
- Beyond stupid.

21:14.272 --> 21:17.141
- Yeah.
- Time for us to set up.

21:17.175 --> 21:19.743
- Wish me luck.
- You don't need it.

21:22.981 --> 21:25.049
Why are you winking when you say that?

21:25.083 --> 21:27.785
Wait, are you being ironic in
that way I totally don't get?

21:27.819 --> 21:29.653
No, no, there's just...

I'll play all our gigs straight.

35:31.878 --> 35:34.580
OK.

35:36.650 --> 35:38.451
You're wrong about one thing though.

35:38.485 --> 35:40.619
Our songs aren't stupid.

35:40.654 --> 35:43.556
They're awesome. At least mine are.

35:51.665 --> 35:53.666
You're not mad at me because
you didn't get paid, are you?

35:53.700 --> 35:55.267
No.

35:55.302 --> 35:57.236
I mean, I was a little
blind-sided by that contacts

35:57.270 --> 35:59.505
- reveal, but...
- I'm being serious.

35:59.539 --> 36:01.407
So am I.

36:02.542 --> 36:05.611
Look, I don't think
Brandon meant to hurt you.

36:05.645 --> 36:11.317
I think he was just upset
at Lou and it came out wrong.

36:11.351 --> 36:15.321
Well, I'm sure they'll work
it out before we go on tour.

36:20.160 --> 36:22.194
I don't want you to go on
tour. Please don't hate me.

36:22.229 --> 36:24.063
What?

36:24.097 --> 36:25.464
I'm sorry.

36:25.499 --> 36:28.234
I should have told you sooner, but I was...

36:28.268 --> 36:31.070
Are you, like... breaking up with me?

36:31.104 --> 36:33.239
No, no. I don't wanna break up.

36:33.273 --> 36:35.241
Or see anyone else.

36:35.275 --> 36:37.042
It's not like that at all. It's just,

36:37.077 --> 36:39.912
I've been dreaming about
this tour for years.

36:39.946 --> 36:45.050
It's a chance for me to really
focus on my music before...

36:45.085 --> 36:48.254
I don't know, life takes over.

36:48.288 --> 36:51.824
It's something I want to do, just for me.

36:51.858 --> 36:54.059
I wouldn't stop you from doing that.

36:54.094 --> 36:56.028
I know.

36:56.062 --> 36:58.831
But I would stop myself.

36:58.865 --> 37:01.767
OK, tonight, through out the entire set

37:01.802 --> 37:04.837
I was scanning the crowd looking for you.

37:04.871 --> 37:06.672
And not because I was worried,

37:06.706 --> 37:10.142
but because I love you and I want to...

37:11.912 --> 37:13.946
... when you're in the room,

37:13.980 --> 37:17.683
you have my undivided attention.

37:20.954 --> 37:23.956
I'm sorry if that hurts your feelings.

37:23.990 --> 37:26.625
Why are you crying?

37:26.660 --> 37:30.830
I'm not it's... it's just my contacts.

37:30.864 --> 37:33.766
Mariana...

37:33.800 --> 37:36.502
OK, fine.

37:36.536 --> 37:38.437
I'm upset...

37:38.471 --> 37:39.672
Really?

37:39.706 --> 37:43.742
Really, but I'll get over it.

37:45.779 --> 37:47.780
You promise?

37:47.814 --> 37:50.616
Promise.

37:56.456 --> 37:58.724
Oh, Jesus, come here...

38:01.661 --> 38:04.263
What is it?

38:05.465 --> 38:07.333
I need you to do something...

38:07.367 --> 38:08.634
Nice glasses.

38:16.309 --> 38:18.377
I'm supposed to be in here,

38:18.411 --> 38:21.380
convincing you guys to adopt Ana's baby.

38:21.414 --> 38:23.515
Mariana asked me to.

38:23.550 --> 38:25.484
Are you guys really thinking about that?

38:25.518 --> 38:28.487
Well, we were hoping to talk about

38:28.521 --> 38:30.155
to the both of you about this.

38:30.190 --> 38:31.390
So you're not...

38:31.424 --> 38:33.359
Look, Jesus, the only
reason we would even consider

38:33.393 --> 38:36.262
taking Ana's baby is

38:36.296 --> 38:38.464
because we love you and Mariana very much

38:38.498 --> 38:41.300
and this baby would be your sister.

38:41.334 --> 38:43.235
And yes we wanted a baby.

38:43.270 --> 38:46.305
But things change, honey.

38:46.339 --> 38:49.041
We were just now sitting
here talking about how nice

38:49.075 --> 38:51.110
it is to get to spend some
time alone together every

38:51.144 --> 38:53.412
once in a while, just the two of us.

38:53.446 --> 38:59.151
The truth is, we have so many legal expenses
right now, trying to fight for Callie,

38:59.185 --> 39:02.154
it's hard enough to put food on
the table for five kids every night.

39:04.391 --> 39:07.259
What if you guys had one less kid to feed?

39:11.264 --> 39:16.068
After today, you must think I'm
some kind of magnet for trouble.

39:16.102 --> 39:19.071
No, no...

39:19.105 --> 39:21.173
I just hope that your friends,

39:21.207 --> 39:24.944
and your brothers and sisters, don't get
you into trouble like that all the time.

39:24.978 --> 39:27.179
I make way more trouble for them.

39:30.250 --> 39:33.085
You never told me why
you didn't get adopted.

39:35.221 --> 39:38.924
My birth father is fighting for custody.

39:40.160 --> 39:43.228
Is he a bad guy?

39:43.263 --> 39:45.898
No, but I just found out about him.

39:45.932 --> 39:48.033
And this is my home.

39:48.068 --> 39:51.270
I love Stef and Lena and I really
want to be a part of the family.

39:53.106 --> 39:54.940
But what?

39:57.110 --> 39:58.310
I did something...

39:58.345 --> 39:59.979
... that they don't know
about and I can't tell them

40:00.013 --> 40:02.081
because it would be really
bad for a lot of people.

40:02.115 --> 40:05.017
I just feel so bad lying to them.

40:05.051 --> 40:08.153
You know, I can't even look
them in the eye and after

40:08.188 --> 40:11.223
everything they've done,
they don't deserve it.

40:11.257 --> 40:14.226
Callie, you have to tell
them, whatever it is?

40:14.260 --> 40:17.029
You're not listening to
me. I cannot tell them!

40:17.063 --> 40:20.099
It would ruin lives and not just mine.

40:20.133 --> 40:22.234
What're you gonna do?

40:32.112 --> 40:35.180
I mean, I'm sure Flintwood
is a great school and all...

40:35.215 --> 40:37.950
It is. It's one of the best in the country.

40:37.984 --> 40:41.053
I'm not ready to say goodbye to our son.

40:42.956 --> 40:44.890
I know. We're supposed
to have two more years.

40:44.924 --> 40:47.793
You don't think this is
the Universe punishing us

40:47.827 --> 40:49.862
because when we were in bed

40:49.896 --> 40:51.096
we said there would be
some pluses to having

40:51.131 --> 40:53.932
the kids out of the house?
We didn't mean tomorrow.

40:58.183 --> 40:59.560
He's just a baby.

41:04.701 --> 41:07.170
- Hey, sweets...
- How was the center?

41:07.371 --> 41:10.269
Oh, it was good, it was pretty good...

41:12.370 --> 41:13.842
So listen, there's
something I have to tell you.

41:15.343 --> 41:16.107
OK...

41:20.008 --> 41:22.407
I think it would be...

41:25.008 --> 41:26.032
... I think...

41:29.033 --> 41:30.750
... I think I should go live with Robert.
