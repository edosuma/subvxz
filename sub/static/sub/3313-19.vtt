00:07.758 --> 00:09.549
"MELISSA AND JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.550 --> 00:13.133
I MOVED OUT, BUT MY
KEY STILL WORKS.

00:13.134 --> 00:16.346
YEAH, I'D BETTER CHANGE THE
LOCKS TO KEEP THE RIFFRAFF OUT.

00:16.347 --> 00:17.978
YOU KNOW YOU LOVE THE
RIFFRAFF, COME HERE.

00:20.101 --> 00:21.941
MM, YOUR LIPS STILL WORK TOO.

00:21.942 --> 00:23.733
WOW, LOOK AT YOU.

00:23.734 --> 00:25.235
ALL DRESSED UP FOR A
DATE WITH LITTLE OLD ME?

00:25.236 --> 00:27.317
WELL, YEAH, I WENT
FULL-ON GODDESS FOR YOU.

00:27.318 --> 00:28.528
AND YOU SURE CLEAN UP NICE.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.910
NOBODY WOULD GUESS
THAT YOU SPENT THE DAY

00:30.911 --> 00:32.452
CHANGING DIAPERS AND
PLAYING PEEK-A-BOO

00:32.453 --> 00:34.494
WITH A PACK OF WILD TODDLERS.

00:34.495 --> 00:36.246
MEL, ACROSS THE STREET
IN THE BUCHWALD HOUSE,

00:36.247 --> 00:38.037
WE LIKE REFER TO THE
CHILDREN AS "HIGH-SPIRITED"

00:38.038 --> 00:41.251
OR, UM, "UNDER MEDICATED."

00:41.252 --> 00:43.544
ENOUGH SHOP TALK. RIGHT HERE.

00:46.127 --> 00:48.338
SO, WAIT A MINUTE...
UM, JUST SO I'M CLEAR,

00:48.339 --> 00:50.009
YOU STILL WANT TO TAKE
THINGS SLOW, RIGHT?

00:50.010 --> 00:51.841
BECAUSE I GOT TO TELL YOU,

00:51.842 --> 00:55.054
A PART OF ME IS REALLY STARTING
TO SPEED UP RIGHT NOW.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.056
YEAH, SORRY, SORRY.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.348
SEX IS STILL OFF THE TABLE.

00:58.349 --> 01:00.850
DAMN IT. I LOVE
SEX ON THE TABLE.

01:00.851 --> 01:02.232
OR ANYWHERE REALLY.

01:02.233 --> 01:04.524
MM, WELL, GOOD THINGS
COME TO THOSE WHO WAIT.

01:04.525 --> 01:06.236
AND IN YOUR CASE,
FANTASTIC THINGS.

01:06.237 --> 01:07.357
LET ME GIVE YOU A PREVIEW.

01:07.358 --> 01:09.029
PREVIEW? OKAY. HMM.

01:10.781 --> 01:14.655
( "Twinkle, Twinkle
Little Star" plays )

01:15.996 --> 01:17.247
YEAH.

01:17.248 --> 01:18.289
IT'S THE NANNY PHONE.

01:21.001 --> 01:22.122
HELLO, MRS. BUCHWALD.

01:22.123 --> 01:24.003
YES.

01:24.004 --> 01:26.005
UH....

01:26.006 --> 01:28.128
SURE, I WILL BE RIGHT OVER.

01:28.129 --> 01:29.299
OKAY, BYE-BYE.

01:29.300 --> 01:30.800
WHAT? I THOUGHT THIS
WAS YOUR NIGHT OFF.

01:30.801 --> 01:31.921
I KNOW. WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

01:31.922 --> 01:33.423
SHE SAID SHE NEEDS
ME OVER THERE STAT.

01:33.424 --> 01:35.925
WELL, I NEED YOU STAT-ER.

01:35.926 --> 01:37.217
I'LL TAKE YOU OUT TO
DINNER TOMORROW NIGHT.

01:37.218 --> 01:38.638
OKAY? TOMORROW NIGHT.
I PROMISE YOU.

01:38.639 --> 01:40.141
BUT RIGHT NOW, YOU
KNOW, DUTY CALLS.

01:41.562 --> 01:43.983
LITERALLY. ( chuckles )

01:43.984 --> 01:46.186
THAT'S FUNNY. DUTY CALLS.

01:46.187 --> 01:48.778
FINE, I UNDERSTAND.
GO OFF TO THE BABY.

01:48.779 --> 01:50.571
EVEN THOUGH HE DIDN'T
SHAVE HIS LEGS FOR YOU.

02:19.470 --> 02:20.470
OKAY, THAT IS A BOWL
OF WHIPPED CREAM.

02:20.471 --> 02:21.642
THAT IS NOT A MEAL.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.186
NOW IT IS.

02:26.187 --> 02:28.608
YOU REALLY EXPECT
ME TO EAT THIS?

02:28.609 --> 02:30.860
OH, MAN, THAT'S GOOD.

02:30.861 --> 02:32.942
TOLD YOU. I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

02:32.943 --> 02:34.944
WAIT, I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING
OUT TO DINNER WITH JOE.

02:34.945 --> 02:36.866
JOE HAD TO WORK TONIGHT.
HE'S ALWAYS ON CALL.

02:36.867 --> 02:38.037
BUT I'M OKAY WITH THAT.

02:38.038 --> 02:40.119
YOU KNOW, DATING A MANNY
IS LIKE DATING A DOCTOR...

02:40.120 --> 02:43.953
EXCEPT WITHOUT THE INCOME,
STATUS, OR ACCESS TO DRUGS.

02:43.954 --> 02:45.375
OKAY.

02:45.376 --> 02:47.247
DIG IN.

02:47.248 --> 02:50.590
I'M NOT EATING THAT. I MISS JOE.

02:50.591 --> 02:52.882
I'M DOING THE BEST I CAN WITH
WHAT'S LEFT IN THE PANTRY.

02:52.883 --> 02:54.595
DIG TO THE BOTTOM. THERE'S
SOME REFRIED BEANS IN THERE.

02:55.846 --> 02:57.967
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS
HOUSE IS FALLING APART

02:57.968 --> 02:59.969
SINCE JOE MOVED OUT.
LOOK AT THIS MESS.

02:59.970 --> 03:01.140
WE EACH NEED TO TAKE ON

03:01.141 --> 03:02.972
AT LEAST ONE MORE OF
JOE'S FORMER DUTIES.

03:02.973 --> 03:04.724
RYDER, YOUR NEW JOB IS
GOING TO THE MARKET.

03:04.725 --> 03:06.356
NO, I'M ALREADY COOKING, OKAY.

03:06.357 --> 03:07.857
AND BESIDES, IN TWO
DAYS, SCHOOL STARTS

03:07.858 --> 03:09.689
AND I GOT TO FIGURE OUT
MY ENTIRE NEW LOOK.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.311
EVERYBODY KNOWS THE FIRST DAY

03:11.312 --> 03:12.772
SETS THE TONE FOR
THE ENTIRE YEAR.

03:12.773 --> 03:14.734
YOUR FIRST DAY ON THIS
PLANET SET THE TONE FOR YOU

03:14.735 --> 03:17.907
AND IT WASN'T A GOOD ONE.

03:17.908 --> 03:19.659
RYDER, I BELIEVE IN YOU.

03:19.660 --> 03:20.950
I KNOW YOU CAN GO TO THE MARKET

03:20.951 --> 03:23.162
AND DRESS YOURSELF.

03:23.163 --> 03:25.164
YEAH, I'M NOT SO SURE
HE CAN DO EITHER.

03:25.165 --> 03:26.286
AND YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF LAUNDRY.

03:26.287 --> 03:27.707
- WHAT?
- OH, HAVE FUN

03:27.708 --> 03:29.789
SCRUBBING MY BOXERS.

03:29.790 --> 03:32.041
NO NO NO NO NO. SEE,
I'VE ALREADY TAKEN ON

03:32.042 --> 03:33.253
ONE OF JOE'S OLD JOBS.

03:33.254 --> 03:35.094
- WHICH ONE?
- SNARKY COMMENTS.

03:35.095 --> 03:36.926
OH, WELL, THAT'LL
HELP US SURVIVE.

03:36.927 --> 03:38.758
OH, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

03:38.759 --> 03:40.430
I'VE ALREADY GOT SNARKY
COMMENTS COVERED.

03:40.431 --> 03:41.511
YOU'RE DOING LAUNDRY.

03:41.512 --> 03:42.682
SO, UM...

03:42.683 --> 03:43.933
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, AUNT MEL?

03:43.934 --> 03:45.895
SUPERVISE, OBVIOUSLY.

03:45.896 --> 03:48.017
SO BASICALLY, SIT
AROUND ON YOUR ASS.

03:48.018 --> 03:50.149
I THOUGHT I MADE IT CLEAR.

03:50.150 --> 03:52.943
I'M SNARKY COMMENTS.

03:55.906 --> 03:57.026
( TV chatter )

03:57.027 --> 03:58.658
LENNOX, YOU'RE
BURNING MY BLOUSE!

03:58.659 --> 03:59.659
WHAT?

03:59.660 --> 04:01.571
HEY.

04:01.572 --> 04:03.743
THIS ISN'T EVEN HOT.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.915
YOU KNOW, IT WOULD
PROBABLY WORK BETTER

04:05.916 --> 04:08.037
IF YOU PLUGGED IT IN.

04:08.038 --> 04:10.540
DARN, YOU KNOW, I JUST...
I DON'T DESERVE

04:10.541 --> 04:12.081
TO BE ON LAUNDRY.

04:12.082 --> 04:13.713
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT TOO LATE

04:13.714 --> 04:15.545
TO PUT ME BACK ON
SNARKY COMMENTS.

04:15.546 --> 04:17.877
YOU GUYS ARE NOT GONNA
BELIEVE WHAT JUST HAPPENED.

04:17.878 --> 04:19.839
UH, WHERE ARE THE GROCERIES?

04:19.840 --> 04:22.011
ALL OVER THE FLOOR OF
AISLE SIX OF ZIPPY MART.

04:22.012 --> 04:23.222
WOW, YOU'RE BOTH DOING
A HELL OF A JOB

04:23.223 --> 04:24.434
HANDLING JOE'S OLD DUTIES.

04:24.435 --> 04:26.516
LOOK, I WAS PAYING FOR GROCERIES

04:26.517 --> 04:27.847
WHEN A GUY PULLED OUT A GUN.

04:27.848 --> 04:30.019
- WAIT, WHAT?
- WELL, TURNS OUT IT WAS A TOY GUN.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.481
NOBODY KNEW THAT AT THE TIME.

04:31.482 --> 04:33.022
STILL, THAT'S SO SCARY.

04:33.023 --> 04:36.816
HEY, I HAD TO USE AN IRON
THAT COULD GET VERY HOT.

04:36.817 --> 04:38.359
IF YOU TURNED IT ON.

04:39.700 --> 04:41.240
- SO WHAT HAPPENED?
- THE CLERK CHASED THE GUY

04:41.241 --> 04:43.613
OUT OF THE STORE WITH A BASEBALL
BAT, RIGHT? AND HE GOT ARRESTED.

04:43.614 --> 04:45.745
AND THE BEST PART, AFTERWARDS,

04:45.746 --> 04:47.367
NEWS 19 INTERVIEWED ME.

04:47.368 --> 04:49.208
OKAY, I'M GONNA
BE ON TV TONIGHT.

04:49.209 --> 04:51.671
WOW, CONGRATULATIONS. HEY,
RECORD IT FOR ME, OKAY?

04:51.672 --> 04:53.583
I CAN'T BE LATE FOR MY BEAU.

04:53.584 --> 04:54.674
MY GIRLS ARE RIDING HIGH

04:54.675 --> 04:56.876
AND I DON'T WANT
TO LET THEM DOWN.

04:56.877 --> 04:59.008
GIDDYUP, Y'ALL.

04:59.009 --> 05:00.760
SO YOU KNOW WHAT
THIS MEANS, RIGHT?

05:00.761 --> 05:04.344
MY FIRST DAY BACK AT SCHOOL ISN'T
GONNA BE A GIANT FESTIVAL OF SUCK.

05:04.345 --> 05:07.977
I SURVIVED A ROBBERY. I
COME IN WITH A GREAT STORY.

05:07.978 --> 05:09.639
YEAH, YOU HAPPENED
TO BE AT A STORE

05:09.640 --> 05:11.521
WHEN IT GOT ROBBED
AND YOU DID NOTHING.

05:11.522 --> 05:13.483
BOY, THAT IS A GREAT STORY.

05:13.484 --> 05:16.315
TOO BAD WE CAN'T
EAT IT FOR DINNER.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.609
WHAT IS DINNER WHEN
YOU'VE GOT FAME?

05:21.992 --> 05:24.654
AND I'LL HAVE THE
PORCINI RISOTTO.

05:24.655 --> 05:26.075
VERY GOOD, MA'AM.

05:26.076 --> 05:27.867
OH, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
IT SAYS HERE,

05:27.868 --> 05:29.038
"ALLOW EXTRA TIME
FOR THE RISOTTO."

05:29.039 --> 05:30.289
HOW MUCH TIME ARE
WE TALKING ABOUT?

05:30.290 --> 05:33.953
- 35 TO 40 MINUTES.
- OOH, 35...

05:33.954 --> 05:35.875
WE BOTH EAT FAST.
THAT SHOULD BE FINE.

05:35.876 --> 05:38.508
I GOT TO BE BACK
AT WORK AT 10:00.

05:38.509 --> 05:41.050
YOU HAVE TO BACK
AT WHERE AT WHEN?

05:41.051 --> 05:42.632
AT WORK AT 10:00.

05:42.633 --> 05:43.963
YEAH, I HEARD YOU
THE FIRST TIME.

05:43.964 --> 05:44.925
I WAS JUST GIVING YOU A CHANCE

05:44.926 --> 05:46.846
TO MAYBE CHANGE YOUR ANSWER.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.678
JOE, I THOUGHT THIS WAS
OUR NIGHT TOGETHER.

05:48.679 --> 05:50.309
WE'RE TOGETHER. LET'S ENJOY IT.

05:50.310 --> 05:51.891
YOU LOOK AMAZING.

05:51.892 --> 05:53.563
I KNOW, I KNOW, BUT SERIOUSLY,

05:53.564 --> 05:54.814
YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO WORK

05:54.815 --> 05:55.935
IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR DATE?

05:55.936 --> 05:57.527
WELL, IF YOU WANT TO GET
TECHNICAL ABOUT IT,

05:57.528 --> 05:59.739
IT WOULD BE AT THE
END OF OUR DATE.

05:59.740 --> 06:02.982
BUT WHAT IF WE WANTED TO DO
SOMETHING ELSE AFTER DINNER?

06:02.983 --> 06:04.574
UH, YOU MADE IT PRETTY CLEAR
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE DOING

06:04.575 --> 06:05.695
SOMETHING ELSE AFTER DINNER.

06:05.696 --> 06:07.487
WELL, WE COULD DO SOMETHING ELSE

06:07.488 --> 06:10.450
BESIDES "SOMETHING ELSE."

06:10.451 --> 06:12.081
OKAY, JUST SO I UNDERSTAND,

06:12.082 --> 06:16.375
ARE WE GONNA BE HAVING
SEX IN ANY FORM TONIGHT?

06:16.376 --> 06:18.709
WE'LL NEVER KNOW NOW, WILL WE?

06:26.346 --> 06:30.059
OKAY, I SENT OUT A
MASS EMAIL, TEXT.

06:30.060 --> 06:31.180
I PUT IT ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK.

06:31.181 --> 06:32.772
EVERYONE I KNOW IS
GOING TO BE TUNING

06:32.773 --> 06:34.013
IN TO CHANNEL 19 TONIGHT.

06:34.014 --> 06:35.565
DON'T COUNT ON IT.
THE ONLY PEOPLE

06:35.566 --> 06:37.066
WHO STILL WATCH THE 10:00 NEWS

06:37.067 --> 06:39.939
JUST DIED IN THEIR CHAIRS.

06:39.940 --> 06:41.280
NO, JUST WAIT.

06:41.281 --> 06:43.613
AFTER THIS, MY
REPUTATION AT SCHOOL

06:43.614 --> 06:45.525
IS GONNA BE SWAG.

06:45.526 --> 06:49.449
BUT IT WON'T IF YOU KEEP
SAYING THINGS LIKE "SWAG."

06:49.450 --> 06:51.120
IT'S ME! OH, IT'S ME.

06:51.121 --> 06:53.122
Well, just... it all
happened so fast, you know.

06:53.123 --> 06:55.124
One minute, I'm coming
in for groceries

06:55.125 --> 06:57.336
and the next minute, I'm
staring death in the face.

06:57.337 --> 06:58.878
I'M ON TV. AND LOOK AT THAT.

06:58.879 --> 07:00.129
THEY SPELLED MY NAME RIGHT.

07:00.130 --> 07:02.211
This guy pulls out a gun
and he yells, "Freeze!"

07:02.212 --> 07:03.843
So I stand there like a statue.

07:03.844 --> 07:05.805
And then he looks my way.

07:05.806 --> 07:09.218
And I swear, I thought
I peed my pants.

07:09.219 --> 07:11.050
GLAD YOU GOT YOUR NAME ON THAT.

07:11.051 --> 07:13.142
NO, NO, NO, KEEP WATCHING.
OKAY, HERO COMING.

07:13.143 --> 07:14.934
Turns out it was a toy gun.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.106
Toy gun... And, uh, you know...

07:17.107 --> 07:18.608
I didn't know at
the time, though.

07:18.609 --> 07:21.320
So what I did is I stepped
behind this girl to hide.

07:21.321 --> 07:23.773
YOU HID BEHIND A GIRL?!

07:23.774 --> 07:26.696
THAT'S NOT ALL I SAID. THAT WAS
NOT THE END OF THE SENTENCE.

07:26.697 --> 07:28.698
WELL, IT SURE SOUNDED
LIKE IT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW

07:28.699 --> 07:30.660
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THE
ZOO'S NEW BABY ELEPHANT.

07:30.661 --> 07:33.242
AWW, YOU COULD HAVE
HID BEHIND HIM TOO.

07:33.243 --> 07:35.414
NO, THAT CANNOT BE IT.

07:35.415 --> 07:37.957
THEY CUT OUT ALL THE
COOL STUFF I SAID.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.458
I SAID I HID BEHIND THE GIRL

07:39.459 --> 07:41.541
SO THAT I COULD MAKE MY
MOVE AND JUMP THE GUY.

07:41.542 --> 07:43.252
OH, I THINK EVERYONE WILL
BE ABLE TO INFER THAT

07:43.253 --> 07:45.505
FROM WHAT YOU SAID ON CAMERA.

07:45.506 --> 07:47.507
OH, NO. THIS...
THIS IS NOT GOOD.

07:47.508 --> 07:49.218
THIS IS NOT HOW YOU WANT
TO GO BACK TO HIGH SCHOOL.

07:49.219 --> 07:51.300
OKAY, I GOT TO
RETHINK EVERYTHING.

07:51.301 --> 07:53.432
I GOT TO RETHINK MY
ENTIRE WARDROBE.

07:53.433 --> 07:56.185
OH, HEY, AUNT MEL,
YOU'RE BACK EARLY.

07:56.186 --> 07:57.647
YOU JUST MISSED
RYDER ON THE NEWS.

07:57.648 --> 07:59.228
OH, YOU DIDN'T MISS ANYTHING.

07:59.229 --> 08:00.399
YOU KNOW WHAT I DO MISS?

08:00.400 --> 08:02.101
HAVING A BOYFRIEND
WHO ISN'T CLUELESS.

08:02.102 --> 08:03.693
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
MAKING OUT RIGHT NOW.

08:03.694 --> 08:05.655
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

08:05.656 --> 08:09.108
JOE HAD A 10:00 CUTOFF
TIME FOR OUR DATE.

08:09.109 --> 08:12.702
HE LEFT NO WIGGLE ROOM
FOR, WELL, WIGGLING.

08:12.703 --> 08:14.994
BUT AREN'T YOU TWO STILL
IN YOUR COURTING STAGE?

08:14.995 --> 08:16.375
WELL, YES.

08:16.376 --> 08:18.417
OKAY, SO JOE'S REALLY
BUSY WITH HIS NEW JOB,

08:18.418 --> 08:20.499
BUT HE WENT OUT OF HIS
WAY TO MAKE TIME FOR YOU

08:20.500 --> 08:25.174
EVEN THOUGH HE KNEW THERE WASN'T
GOING TO BE ANY WIGGLING.

08:25.175 --> 08:26.886
WELL, WHEN YOU PUT IT LIKE THAT,

08:26.887 --> 08:28.718
YOU MAKE JOE SOUND LIKE A
NICE GUY AND LIKE I SHOULD...

08:28.719 --> 08:30.801
- APOLOGIZE?
- YEAH, I WAS GETTING TO THAT.

08:33.433 --> 08:35.304
YOU'RE APOLOGIZING BY TEXT?

08:35.305 --> 08:37.056
I WAS USING A CUTE EMOJI.

08:37.057 --> 08:39.268
NO. YOU'VE GOT TO
DO IT IN PERSON,

08:39.269 --> 08:40.850
AND THE SOONER, THE BETTER.

08:40.851 --> 08:42.942
GEEZ, HOW COME I'M THE MOST
MATURE PERSON AROUND HERE?

08:42.943 --> 08:45.065
HONESTLY, YOU DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF COMPETITION.

08:50.360 --> 08:52.111
( tapping ) JOE, JOE.

08:52.112 --> 08:54.203
- OPEN UP, COME ON.
- MEL, HEY.

08:54.204 --> 08:55.534
HEY, HEY, HEY! SHH, SHH, SHH!

08:55.535 --> 08:56.656
KEEP IT DOWN, WILL YOU?

08:56.657 --> 08:58.118
YOU HAVE TO BE VERY
QUIET AROUND HERE.

08:59.289 --> 09:01.500
( loud thuds )

09:01.501 --> 09:03.122
OH, I'M MAKING NOISE?

09:03.123 --> 09:05.214
SURE, PUT THE NANNY
IN THE FIRETRAP ROOM.

09:05.215 --> 09:06.505
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

09:06.506 --> 09:08.298
OKAY.

09:10.130 --> 09:12.171
LISTEN, I KNOW YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO HAVE VISITORS,

09:12.172 --> 09:13.633
BUT THIS COULDN'T WAIT.
I JUST...

09:13.634 --> 09:15.635
I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE.
YOU KNOW, I MAY HAVE

09:15.636 --> 09:18.137
SLIGHTLY OVERREACTED
TO YOUR DATE DEADLINE.

09:18.138 --> 09:20.981
- SLIGHTLY?
- OKAY, LEARN HOW TO ACCEPT AN APOLOGY.

09:22.182 --> 09:23.272
ANYWAY, I JUST NEVER WANT
US TO GO TO BED MAD,

09:23.273 --> 09:24.684
SO I BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING.

09:24.685 --> 09:26.146
YOU BROUGHT ME SOMETHING?
WHAT'D YOU BRING ME?

09:27.237 --> 09:28.028
AWW.

09:28.029 --> 09:29.779
WELL, GOOD NIGHT.

09:29.780 --> 09:31.030
GOOD NIGHT. MWAH.

09:31.031 --> 09:32.742
HEY, WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT.

09:32.743 --> 09:35.534
MAYBE YOU COULD STAY AND JUST
JOIN ME FOR LIKE ONE DRINK.

09:35.535 --> 09:37.787
WELL, I'VE NEVER SAID
NO TO THAT BEFORE.

09:37.788 --> 09:39.199
( thuds )

09:46.126 --> 09:47.506
PARDON MY STEMWARE.

09:47.507 --> 09:48.918
DON'T WORRY.

09:48.919 --> 09:50.549
IT'S NOT THE WEIRDEST THING
I EVER DRANK OUT OF.

09:50.550 --> 09:54.213
I ONCE DRANK BATHTUB GIN
FROM AN ACTUAL BATHTUB.

09:54.214 --> 09:56.015
THERE WAS A GUY IN
IT AT THE TIME.

09:56.016 --> 09:57.306
AND HIS TWIN BROTHER CHARLIE

09:57.307 --> 09:59.058
- WHO HAD THESE DELTOIDS...
- HEY, YO, MEL, MEL.

09:59.059 --> 10:00.930
I THINK NOW THAT WE'RE DATING,

10:00.931 --> 10:02.021
WE SHOULD MAYBE
INSTITUTE A LITTLE

10:02.022 --> 10:04.023
"DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL"
POLICY ABOUT THE PAST.

10:04.024 --> 10:05.725
OKAY, SO, YOU KNOW,

10:05.726 --> 10:08.067
ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED, SAY,
BEFORE THREE YEARS AGO,

10:08.068 --> 10:10.399
WE SHOULD PROBABLY JUST
PUT IN A LITTLE LOCKBOX.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.191
I THINK I'M GONNA NEED
MORE THAN A LOCKBOX.

10:12.192 --> 10:14.533
MAYBE LIKE A WHOLE STORAGE UNIT.

10:14.534 --> 10:16.575
WHAT A PRETTY PICTURE.

10:16.576 --> 10:18.577
WHICH WE CAN MAKE DISAPPEAR NOW

10:18.578 --> 10:20.039
WITH OUR LIQUID ERASER.

10:20.040 --> 10:22.122
WORKS FOR ME.

10:24.204 --> 10:25.916
- TO NEW BEGINNINGS.
- ( chuckles )

10:32.963 --> 10:35.014
SO ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE
OKAY WITH JUST MAKING OUT?

10:35.015 --> 10:36.757
IT'S BETTER THAN NOT MAKING OUT.

10:38.719 --> 10:43.813
( baby cries )

10:43.814 --> 10:45.975
IT'S IRONIC THAT THE
RESULT OF ROMANCE

10:45.976 --> 10:48.227
IS SO UNROMANTIC.

10:48.228 --> 10:50.069
YUP, I GOT TO GET THAT.

10:50.070 --> 10:52.191
OH, CAN'T YOU JUST LET
IT GO TO VOICEMAIL?

10:52.192 --> 10:55.234
( crying continues )

10:55.235 --> 10:57.326
( murmurs )

10:57.327 --> 10:59.830
MAN, AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO PREVENT THAT?

11:01.992 --> 11:03.242
PICKED UP A NEW
OUTFIT FOR SCHOOL.

11:03.243 --> 11:04.243
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

11:04.244 --> 11:05.785
RYDER?

11:05.786 --> 11:07.336
RYDER, ARE YOU STILL HERE?

11:07.337 --> 11:09.088
'CAUSE YOU'RE LITERALLY
BLENDING IN WITH THE WALL.

11:09.089 --> 11:10.129
PERFECT.

11:10.130 --> 11:12.131
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
TO LOOK COOL.

11:12.132 --> 11:14.754
THAT WAS BEFORE THE NEWS
TURNED ME INTO A MASSIVE GEEK.

11:14.755 --> 11:16.886
SO MY NEW GOAL IS INVISIBILITY.

11:16.887 --> 11:19.008
'CAUSE WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE, YOU
CAN'T THROW IN A DUMPSTER.

11:19.009 --> 11:20.679
RYDER, RELAX.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.722
OKAY, I TOLD YOU. NOBODY
WATCHES THE NEWS.

11:22.723 --> 11:23.853
( beeping )

11:23.854 --> 11:26.015
OH, AN INSTANT
MESSAGE FROM MAYA.

11:26.016 --> 11:29.859
"OMG, YOUR BROTHER'S
VIDEO IS BLOWING UP."

11:29.860 --> 11:33.233
OKAY, SO ONE PERSON
WATCHES THE NEWS.

11:35.025 --> 11:36.405
Well, just... it all
happened so fast.

11:36.406 --> 11:37.656
- ( music plays )
- You know, I...

11:37.657 --> 11:39.118
One minute, I'm coming
in for groceries,

11:39.119 --> 11:41.410
and the next minute I'm
staring death in the face.

11:41.411 --> 11:43.452
- WHAT?
- This guy pulls out a gun and yells,

11:43.453 --> 11:46.205
"Freeze!" So I stand
there like a statue.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.877

ON THE INTERNET TODAY?

12:01.471 --> 12:03.012
EVERYONE.

12:03.013 --> 12:05.644
BUT IT'S ONLY GOT 35,000 VIEWS.

12:05.645 --> 12:08.268
AND IT'S BEEN UP FOR
SIX WHOLE MINUTES.

12:10.060 --> 12:12.151

12:34.174 --> 12:36.136
OR YOUR CROTCH.

12:39.339 --> 12:41.721
- OKAY, HE'S ASLEEP.
- OH.

12:43.593 --> 12:46.685
WELL, THIS IS, UH...
THIS IS NICE.

12:46.686 --> 12:48.647
YEAH, JUST YOU AND ME

12:48.648 --> 12:51.441
AND SOMEBODY ELSE'S BABY.

12:53.313 --> 12:55.024
WELL, I SHOULD PROBABLY GO.

12:55.025 --> 12:56.525
YEAH, YEAH, YOU SHOULD.

12:56.526 --> 12:57.897
YUP, ACTUALLY THE BUCHWALDS

12:57.898 --> 12:59.278
HAVE A VERY STRICT
NO-GUEST POLICY.

12:59.279 --> 13:02.361
SO THANK YOU FOR,
UM, COMING OVER.

13:02.362 --> 13:04.743
BUT A QUICK KISS
GOOD-BYE IS OKAY, RIGHT?

13:04.744 --> 13:07.207
I DON'T SEE A PROBLEM WITH THAT.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.912
JOE, WHERE'S TUCKER?

13:15.005 --> 13:16.465
JOE, OPEN UP. I
WANT TO FEED HIM.

13:16.466 --> 13:17.466
IS IT STUCK?

13:17.467 --> 13:19.008
NO.

13:19.009 --> 13:21.051
I WANT US TO GET CAUGHT.

13:26.686 --> 13:28.557
JOE, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
OPEN THE DOOR.

13:28.558 --> 13:31.190
YES, YES, HE'S HERE.

13:31.191 --> 13:32.601
IT'S NOT OPENING. WHAT DO I DO?

13:32.602 --> 13:35.024
SHH! WILL YOU? I'LL
BE RIGHT THERE.

13:35.025 --> 13:36.235
I'M ON MY WAY.

13:36.236 --> 13:38.237
HOW FAR IS IT FROM
YOUR BED TO THE DOOR?

13:38.238 --> 13:40.399
( laughs ) THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.821
WE NEED TO HIDE YOU. THE CLOSET!
COME ON.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.494
- SERIOUSLY?
- YES!

13:46.156 --> 13:47.496
HELLO, HERE'S YOUR BABY.

13:47.497 --> 13:48.537
THERE'S TUCKER.
HE'S RIGHT THERE.

13:48.538 --> 13:50.369
OKAY, WELL, I NEED TO NURSE HIM.

13:50.370 --> 13:54.333
ABSOLUTELY, YES, YOU ARE
THE MAN FOR THE JOB.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.215
OR SHOULD I SAY WOMAN?
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, WITH...

13:56.216 --> 13:57.546
WITH THOSE THINGS OUT TO HERE,

13:57.547 --> 13:58.757
YOU'RE DEFINITELY NOT A MAN.

13:58.758 --> 14:01.510
YEAH, I'M NOT SURE THAT
THAT'S APPROPRIATE,

14:01.511 --> 14:03.633
BUT, UM, THANK YOU.

14:11.061 --> 14:13.392
- JOE.
- YES!

14:13.393 --> 14:15.895
WHOSE SCARF IS THAT?

14:15.896 --> 14:18.478
IT'S MINE.

14:19.479 --> 14:21.110
I, UH... I... I...

14:21.111 --> 14:24.153
I LOVE... I LOVE... I LOVE
THE WAY IT FEELS ON MY SKIN.

14:24.154 --> 14:26.325
REMINDS ME OF...

14:26.326 --> 14:30.409
MY PET RABBIT.

14:30.410 --> 14:32.451
YOU'RE VERY SECURE
WITH YOUR MASCULINITY.

14:32.452 --> 14:34.254
YES, I AM.

14:36.836 --> 14:38.587
ALL RIGHT, WELL, I WILL
SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.

14:38.588 --> 14:40.169
YOU'RE OFF THE CLOCK.

14:40.170 --> 14:41.460
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

14:41.461 --> 14:42.382
SORRY ABOUT YOUR BREASTS.

14:43.803 --> 14:47.216
I MEAN, MENTIONING THEM.

14:47.217 --> 14:50.010
I'M SUCH A BOOB.
THAT DIDN'T HELP.

14:54.354 --> 14:56.435
- ARE YOU OKAY?
- THAT WAS SO HOT.

14:56.436 --> 14:57.686
AWW, MAN, I'M SORRY.

14:57.687 --> 14:59.228
NO, NOT HOT IN THE CLOSET.

14:59.229 --> 15:01.070
HOT ALMOST GETTING
CAUGHT IN A BOY'S ROOM.

15:01.071 --> 15:03.322
WAIT A MINUTE, THAT... THAT...
THAT TURNED YOU ON?

15:03.323 --> 15:04.403
LIKE HIGH SCHOOL. LET'S HURRY UP

15:04.404 --> 15:05.444
BEFORE YOUR PARENTS COME BACK.

15:05.445 --> 15:06.525
WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT.

15:06.526 --> 15:08.077
ARE YOU SURE YOU
WANT TO DO THIS?

15:08.078 --> 15:10.579
BECAUSE I AM TOTALLY
OKAY WITH WAITING.

15:10.580 --> 15:13.243
- YEAH, I'M NOT.
- ALL RIGHT, THAT WORKS FOR ME TOO.

15:23.043 --> 15:24.383
WELL, WELL, WELL.

15:24.384 --> 15:28.347
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE
VIOLATED THEIR CURFEW.

15:28.348 --> 15:30.469
WELL, I MAY HAVE GONE
OVER TO APOLOGIZE.

15:30.470 --> 15:32.351
AND IT MAY HAVE TAKEN
LONGER THAN EXPECTED.

15:32.352 --> 15:33.642
MM, THAT MUST HAVE
BEEN SOME APOLOGY.

15:33.643 --> 15:37.356
IT SOMEHOW TURNED YOUR
SKIRT AROUND BACKWARDS.

15:37.357 --> 15:38.517
OH, LOOK, HERE'S RYDER.

15:38.518 --> 15:39.768
LET'S FOCUS ON HIM.

15:39.769 --> 15:41.900
HEY, RYDER, FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL.

15:41.901 --> 15:43.652
- ARE YOU READY?
- I'M NOT GOING.

15:43.653 --> 15:46.365
THAT'S THE SPIRIT... WAIT, WHAT?

15:46.366 --> 15:48.367
YEAH, I'VE GONE VIRAL.

15:48.368 --> 15:49.908
OH, HONEY, I'M SO SORRY.
YOU'RE A BOY.

15:49.909 --> 15:51.910
WE DIDN'T THINK YOU
NEEDED THAT SHOT.

15:51.911 --> 15:53.952
NO, NO, MY NEWS INTERVIEW,

15:53.953 --> 15:56.535

REALLY SCARY SITUATION.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.014

HAVE PEED THEIR PANTS.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.185
I DIDN'T PEE MY PANTS.

- MORNING.

16:42.582 --> 16:44.383
SO QUESTION FOR YOU.

16:44.384 --> 16:47.005
THIS MORNING I SAW A WOMAN

16:47.006 --> 16:48.837
RUNNING THROUGH OUR LAWN

16:48.838 --> 16:51.430
AND DODGING THE SPRINKLERS.

16:51.431 --> 16:53.392
LOOKED LIKE SHE WAS LEAVING YOUR ROOM.
DID YOU SEE HER?

16:53.393 --> 16:55.514
NO.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.636
MAYBE IT WAS THE GARDENER...

16:57.637 --> 17:00.399
...'S WIFE.

17:00.400 --> 17:01.560
IT WAS MEL BURKE.

17:01.561 --> 17:03.272
( sighs )

17:03.273 --> 17:05.854
WOW, GEEZ, LOOK.

17:05.855 --> 17:07.066
I'M... I'M... I'M SORRY.

17:07.067 --> 17:08.317
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
HAD A GUEST OVER HERE

17:08.318 --> 17:09.698
WITHOUT ASKING YOUR PERMISSION.

17:09.699 --> 17:11.360
SHE ACTUALLY JUST CAME
OVER TO GIVE ME SOMETHING.

17:11.361 --> 17:13.702
OH, I KNOW WHAT SHE GAVE YOU.

17:13.703 --> 17:15.414
- YOU DO?
- YEAH, YOU SEE,

17:15.415 --> 17:16.745
LAST NIGHT WHEN I
LEFT YOUR ROOM,

17:16.746 --> 17:20.789
I ACCIDENTLY TOOK THE WRONG
END OF THE BABY MONITOR.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.461
SO YOU HAD THE RECEIVING END?

17:22.462 --> 17:23.462
I DID.

17:23.463 --> 17:25.794
WHICH MEANS THAT I HAD THE...

17:25.795 --> 17:27.836
TRANSMITTING END?

17:27.837 --> 17:28.927
YOU DID.

17:28.928 --> 17:30.259
OH GOD.

17:30.260 --> 17:32.221
YEAH, YOU SAID A LOT
OF THAT LAST NIGHT.

17:32.222 --> 17:33.302
AS DID MEL.

17:33.303 --> 17:35.724
I HAD NO IDEA SHE
WAS SO RELIGIOUS

17:35.725 --> 17:37.936
OR SO BOSSY.

17:37.937 --> 17:39.438
THAT WAS REALLY UNPROFESSIONAL.

17:39.439 --> 17:41.270
I PROMISE YOU THAT WILL
NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

17:41.271 --> 17:44.484
NO, NO, PLEASE.
PROMISE ME IT WILL.

17:45.735 --> 17:47.065
EXCUSE ME?

17:47.066 --> 17:48.527
THE SOUNDS OF YOU AND MEL

17:48.528 --> 17:50.028
IGNITED THE FIRST
NIGHT OF PASSION

17:50.029 --> 17:52.070
THAT ZEV AND I HAVE HAD
SINCE THE BABY WAS BORN.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.402
SO I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION.

17:53.403 --> 17:55.195
WHEN WILL SHE BE COMING BACK?

18:00.870 --> 18:02.541
UGH!

18:02.542 --> 18:03.582
( shudders )

18:03.583 --> 18:05.003
( gagging )

18:05.004 --> 18:06.545
MM, WELL, I JUST FOUND OUT

18:06.546 --> 18:08.297
THAT I WORK FOR A
DISGUSTING WOMAN.

18:08.298 --> 18:10.839
OR SHOULD I SAY I USED TO
WORK FOR A DISGUSTING WOMAN?

18:10.840 --> 18:12.921
MEL, SIENNA KNEW THAT YOU
SLEPT OVER LAST NIGHT.

18:12.922 --> 18:14.303
OH, NO, DID SHE FIRE YOU?

18:14.304 --> 18:15.424
NO, GET THIS...

18:15.425 --> 18:17.136
SHE LISTENED TO
US ALL NIGHT LONG

18:17.137 --> 18:18.478
ON THE BABY MONITOR.

18:19.979 --> 18:21.520
AND SHE LIKED IT.

18:21.521 --> 18:22.392
YEAH.

18:22.393 --> 18:23.522
SO I QUIT.

18:23.523 --> 18:25.484
WAIT, SHE REALLY...

18:25.485 --> 18:26.725
- UGH!
- MM-HMM.

18:26.726 --> 18:28.487
THAT'S SO GROSS.

18:28.488 --> 18:31.230
YET STRANGELY FLATTERING.

18:31.231 --> 18:33.532
ANYWAY, NOW I DON'T HAVE A
PLACE TO LIVE OR A JOB.

18:33.533 --> 18:34.573
SO I'M BASICALLY
BACK TO SQUARE ONE.

18:34.574 --> 18:36.945
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE
HECK I'M GONNA DO NOW.

18:36.946 --> 18:39.538
JOE, YOU SERIOUSLY THINK
THAT YOU HAVE PROBLEMS?

18:39.539 --> 18:42.371
FOR THE REST OF HIGH SCHOOL,
I'M GONNA BE KNOWN AS

18:42.372 --> 18:45.544
RYDER "PEED HIS PANTS" SCANLON.

18:45.545 --> 18:47.456
LOOK, YOUR SOLUTION IS STARING
AT YOU RIGHT IN THE FACE.

18:47.457 --> 18:48.797
JUST MOVE IN AND PAY RENT.

18:48.798 --> 18:51.300
THAT'S RIDICULOUS. THAT...

18:51.301 --> 18:53.172
COULD ACTUALLY POSSIBLY
BE A SOLUTION.

18:53.173 --> 18:54.713
YOU'RE WELCOME.

18:54.714 --> 18:57.426
♪ I SWEAR I PEED MY PANTS ♪

18:57.427 --> 19:00.099
OH, GOD! NOW I'M SINGING IT!

19:01.601 --> 19:03.892
LOOK, I KNOW HE'S A LITTLE
HIGH-STRUNG THIS MORNING,

19:03.893 --> 19:05.814
BUT "PEED HIS
PANTS" HAS A POINT.

19:05.815 --> 19:07.816
NOW WOULD YOU SERIOUSLY CONSIDER

19:07.817 --> 19:09.228
MOVING BACK INTO YOUR OLD ROOM?

19:09.229 --> 19:11.440
YEAH, I MIGHT, BUT
LIKE THE BOY SAID,

19:11.441 --> 19:12.481
THERE WOULD HAVE
TO BE CONDITIONS.

19:12.482 --> 19:14.323
YOU KNOW, LIKE I WOULD
HAVE TO PAY RENT.

19:14.324 --> 19:16.535
ALTHOUGH, NOT TOO MUCH BECAUSE IT'S
NOT REALLY THAT GREAT UP THERE.

19:16.536 --> 19:18.617
HONESTLY, I'M NOT EVEN
SURE IF IT'S UP TO CODE.

19:18.618 --> 19:20.539
AT LEAST THE WINDOWS WORK.

19:20.540 --> 19:21.491
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:21.492 --> 19:23.702
IF SOMEBODY'S NICE TO
ME, I MAY EVEN CONSIDER

19:23.703 --> 19:25.664
PARTAKING IN A LITTLE
COOKING EVERY NOW AND THEN.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.416
BUT NOT BECAUSE IT'S
PART OF MY JOB.

19:27.417 --> 19:29.458
JUST BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
I FIND IT RELAXING

19:29.459 --> 19:31.169
AND BECAUSE I EXCEL AT IT.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.961
IT SOUNDS LIKE A
GOOD DEAL TO ME.

19:32.962 --> 19:34.963
ALTHOUGH, IT WAS KIND OF FUN

19:34.964 --> 19:36.255
SNEAKING UP IN YOUR ROOM.

19:36.256 --> 19:39.097
WELL, MAYBE YOU COULD TRY
SNEAKING UPSTAIRS TONIGHT.

19:39.098 --> 19:41.640
OH, WELL, ONLY IF YOUR
LANDLADY'S OKAY WITH IT.

19:41.641 --> 19:42.931
WE'D HAVE TO KEEP
IT ON THE DOWN-LOW

19:42.932 --> 19:44.513
BECAUSE, BETWEEN YOU AND ME,

19:44.514 --> 19:46.014
I THINK SHE HAS A THING FOR ME.

19:46.015 --> 19:49.187
OH, AS LONG AS YOU HAVE
A THING FOR HER...

19:49.188 --> 19:51.401
CALLED A RENT CHECK.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.578
HEY, AUNT MEL.

19:59.579 --> 20:01.199
HEY, JOE. TAKE OFF
YOUR APRON, ALL RIGHT,

20:01.200 --> 20:02.411
'CAUSE TONIGHT I'M
TAKING EVERYBODY OUT.

20:02.412 --> 20:03.622
DINNER'S ON ME.

20:03.623 --> 20:05.083
FIRST OF ALL, UM,

20:05.084 --> 20:06.995

20:06.996 --> 20:09.127
SECONDLY, YOU DO REALIZE WHEN
YOU TAKE PEOPLE OUT TO DINNER,

20:09.128 --> 20:10.249
SOMEBODY HAS TO
ACTUALLY PAY FOR THAT.

20:10.250 --> 20:11.750
OH NO, I'M PAYING

REACHED TWO MILLION HITS.

20:27.016 --> 20:29.808

RECOMMENDED BUY.

20:29.809 --> 20:32.311
