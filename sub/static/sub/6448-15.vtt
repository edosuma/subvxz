I don't know about that. I mean,
I'm more partial to sporks myself...

37:02.345 --> 37:04.802
...but a girl can never have too many...

37:04.972 --> 37:06.473
."spoons?

37:06.641 --> 37:09.599
I never should've wrapped up
that Pandora's box to begin with...

37:09.769 --> 37:12.260
...and second-guessed myself or us.

37:12.438 --> 37:13.598
From now on, I won't.

We should say that next time
you won't take advice about relationships...

...from Clark Kent.

37:20.655 --> 37:23.192
You know, speaking of Clark....

37:24.450 --> 37:28.659
For future reference and, you know,
strictly for environmental purposes...

37:28.829 --> 37:31.571
...next time you wanna take a shower
with someone, ask me.

37:31.749 --> 37:35.162
I can't remember blacking out
and I wish I could forget waking up.

37:35.336 --> 37:36.997
It couldn't have been that bad.

37:37.171 --> 37:39.583
Wasn't there a time
you would have given anything...

37:39.757 --> 37:42.043
...to stare at that farmer's tan
in all its glory?

37:42.218 --> 37:46.587
That was a long time ago, like,
in a Smallville far, far away.

37:48.849 --> 37:52.012
I mean, okay, yeah, I did love Clark.

37:52.186 --> 37:53.426
A lot.

37:53.604 --> 37:58.189
And I waited for years for him to see that,
to see me. Heh.

37:59.026 --> 38:01.517
But even with his x-ray vision,
he never did.

38:02.613 --> 38:06.822
I think more than that,
I just wanted someone who would get me.

38:09.287 --> 38:12.950
And as good a friend as Clark is,
he's never gonna be that person.

38:13.791 --> 38:16.157
Which is ﬁne. Really.

38:17.378 --> 38:21.212
I mean, those wounds healed
over a thousand super-saves ago.

38:22.258 --> 38:24.044
Now there's just scars.

38:26.971 --> 38:28.927
It's Clark's loss.

38:32.601 --> 38:33.681
What about your loss?

38:34.353 --> 38:38.062
I'm sure that Lois didn't have to drag you
into the woods kicking and screaming.

38:38.607 --> 38:40.143
Uh....

38:40.651 --> 38:46.237
Yeah, that's kind of a funny thing
about scars, you know...

38:47.074 --> 38:48.939
...they're always there.

38:51.746 --> 38:53.907
It doesn't mean they haven't healed.

38:58.919 --> 39:01.752
Sometimes they can be kind of cute too,
huh?

39:02.298 --> 39:05.586
You have one in particular
that I'm partial—

39:09.638 --> 39:11.094
Shh.

39:19.899 --> 39:22.140
Well, as incredible
as that R and R attempt was...

39:22.318 --> 39:25.230
...I think we should skip
the old B & B's for a while.

39:25.404 --> 39:29.693
Lois, for our ﬁrst weekend away together,
it could have been worse.

39:30.076 --> 39:33.944
l was possessed by a 300-year-old Scottish
banshee and I almost killed you, Clark.

39:34.121 --> 39:36.498
We did get to see
the world's largest ball of yarn.

39:36.665 --> 39:41.625
-That made the whole trip worthwhile.
-Al| thanks to my stellar sense of direction.

39:41.796 --> 39:44.708
Let's face it, Clark, without me,
you'd still be lost.

39:50.012 --> 39:51.468

39:54.642 --> 39:56.348
Oh. Heh.
