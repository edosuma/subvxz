00:00.695 --> 00:02.543
<i>Prevously on Kyle XY...</i>

00:02.797 --> 00:04.720
Join us at Latnok.

00:05.189 --> 00:06.213
Participate.

00:06.381 --> 00:08.924
- You still haven't told me for what.
- Inspire them.

00:09.431 --> 00:12.970
Be inspired. Shape the future.
With you on board there are no limits.

00:13.138 --> 00:16.557
We have to get away from all this,
Jessi, we have to start our new life!

00:17.002 --> 00:19.074
My mother, she left.

00:19.174 --> 00:20.520
- She left me.
- I'm sorry.

00:20.687 --> 00:23.755
Should I ignore the fact that you're
conspiring with Jessi to get me in here?

00:23.855 --> 00:25.691
We've liked the idea
of her here for a while,

00:25.859 --> 00:28.261
but so far she hasn't proved
to be a very trustworthy girl.

00:28.445 --> 00:31.192
The Latnok organization,
the one Kyle's working with,

00:31.292 --> 00:32.704
I'm a part of it.

00:34.008 --> 00:35.802
You're what?

00:35.953 --> 00:38.596
- You're not sick again, are you?
- It's not the cancer.

00:38.696 --> 00:41.140
- It's worse.
- What could be worse than that?

00:42.211 --> 00:45.127
Cleveland. We move
at the end of the month.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.254
But I can't be with you

00:47.422 --> 00:49.515
when I know
I'm losing you to someone else.

00:49.615 --> 00:52.134
- You could never lose me.
- I already have.

00:52.302 --> 00:53.894
I was gonna tell Amanda everything.

00:53.994 --> 00:56.582
You'll be adding her to a list of people
you've already compromised.

00:56.682 --> 00:58.417
Oh, Doogie Howser's got a girlfriend?

00:58.517 --> 01:01.029
- Not anymore.
- Amanda's a nice girl, Nate.

01:01.129 --> 01:03.010
In other words,
totally off-limits to you.

01:03.110 --> 01:05.197
- I'm Nate, by the way.
- Amanda.

01:05.298 --> 01:07.410
- Amanda came by.
- She did?

01:07.510 --> 01:09.443
- When?
- The other day.

01:09.543 --> 01:11.371
Why didn't you tell me about Amanda?

01:11.471 --> 01:13.772
Because I don't want you
to be with her.

01:14.658 --> 01:16.200
I want you to be with me.

01:22.990 --> 01:25.543
- Jessi told you she's on to you?
- I was surprised too.

01:25.711 --> 01:27.152
Surprised, why?

01:27.252 --> 01:29.482
Come on, man. She's had her eye
on you since the moment

01:29.582 --> 01:31.087
she got her head straight.

01:32.426 --> 01:33.452
What did you say?

01:33.552 --> 01:35.127
He said he doesn't see me that way.

01:35.227 --> 01:38.681
Okay, we're talking about the same
Cassidy who was all over you?

01:39.187 --> 01:41.100
- Cassidy, yeah.
- That's so weird.

01:41.268 --> 01:43.602
I could've sword I saw him
throwing you the "sex me" vibe.

01:43.976 --> 01:45.631
He said he just wants
to be my friend.

01:45.731 --> 01:48.275
You actually said you
just want to be friends?

01:48.375 --> 01:50.123
Yes. What?

01:50.223 --> 01:52.839
That's the one sentence
no girl ever wants to hear.

01:53.079 --> 01:55.114
Trust me. I've busted it out
once or twice.

01:55.282 --> 01:57.742
- But it's the truth.
- It's basically a nicer way of saying,

01:57.910 --> 02:01.078
- "I reject you completely."
- I didn't know that.

02:01.246 --> 02:03.372
Well, lucky for you, Jessi
probably didn't, either.

02:03.674 --> 02:04.882
What did she say?

02:04.982 --> 02:06.459
You ran away?

02:06.974 --> 02:10.044
- I haven't talked to him since.
- But you still like him?

02:11.697 --> 02:13.987
Okay. All is not lost.
We can fix this.

02:14.087 --> 02:14.930
Really?

02:16.036 --> 02:17.044
First step,

02:17.144 --> 02:19.073
stabilize the situation.

02:19.173 --> 02:20.231
Stabilize.

02:20.331 --> 02:22.710
Well, Cassidy's gonna be
a little freaked out so

02:22.810 --> 02:24.310
you have to un-freak him.

02:24.576 --> 02:25.881
How do I do that?

02:26.590 --> 02:27.942
Take it all back.

02:28.441 --> 02:29.857
How do I take it back?

02:30.025 --> 02:31.491
Just tell him you were

02:31.591 --> 02:33.447
drunk or feverish or

02:33.669 --> 02:35.557
caught the Ebola virus
or something.

02:35.657 --> 02:37.656
That doesn't seem
like a very good plan.

02:37.824 --> 02:41.056
Just tell him you had
a temporary moment of craziness,

02:41.156 --> 02:42.500
but it's past

02:42.600 --> 02:44.959
and you are 100 percent over it.

02:45.059 --> 02:46.081
Done. Complete.

02:46.669 --> 02:48.667
- And you think that will work?
- Trust me.

02:48.835 --> 02:50.950
I have years of high school
under my belt.

02:51.612 --> 02:54.390
You know, it's possible to have
feelings for two girls at the same time.

02:54.549 --> 02:56.509
But I don't think
I have feelings for Jessi.

02:56.763 --> 02:58.928
You don't think or you don't?

02:59.407 --> 03:01.307
I guess I've never
thought about it before.

03:01.407 --> 03:03.815
Right. I mean, how could it have
possibly occurred to you

03:03.915 --> 03:05.984
that you and Jessi
could be compatible?

03:06.084 --> 03:08.642
I mean, tons of people can
communicate telepathically,

03:08.742 --> 03:11.565
leap off buildings, and
move water with their minds.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.164
I love Amanda.

03:17.264 --> 03:18.531
I always have.

03:18.699 --> 03:21.814
- Then get back together with her.
- I can't. Not yet, anyway.

03:21.914 --> 03:24.215
- Why not?
- I can't try to win Amanda back

03:24.315 --> 03:27.184
until I'm completely sure
that Latnok can be trusted.

03:27.284 --> 03:29.667
Well, you better
get moving on that.

03:30.955 --> 03:32.590
- How you doing?
- Good.

03:39.209 --> 03:42.388
Well, man, one thing's for sure.
You've got your hands full.

<font color=#00FFFF>Season 3 Episode 7:
Chemistry 101</font>

03:58.402 --> 04:00.292
- I take it back.
- Take what back?

04:00.392 --> 04:01.448
What I said.

04:02.545 --> 04:03.421
I...

04:03.521 --> 04:05.728
had a temporary moment
of craziness,

04:06.045 --> 04:08.490
but it's passed
and I'm 100 percent over it.

04:08.590 --> 04:09.748
Done. Complete.

04:11.337 --> 04:13.669
- Or it may have been Ebola.
- Ebola?

04:13.837 --> 04:15.263
Never mind. No.

04:16.951 --> 04:18.382
- Jessi, I...
- No.

04:18.951 --> 04:20.851
We don't need
to talk about it.

04:20.951 --> 04:23.428
You're my friend.
Everything else...

04:23.931 --> 04:26.249
I was just confused.

04:26.962 --> 04:29.302
I wanted to be closer to you,
and I got confused.

04:29.478 --> 04:31.915
So if you're freaking,
it's okay to un-freak.

04:32.015 --> 04:32.833
I'm...

04:32.933 --> 04:33.812
not...

04:34.199 --> 04:35.122
freaking.

04:35.850 --> 04:36.752
Good.

04:36.852 --> 04:38.068
Me neither.

04:40.145 --> 04:40.972
Wait.

04:41.529 --> 04:43.216
Are you going to Latnok?

04:43.593 --> 04:44.390
Yes.

04:44.852 --> 04:45.939
Take me with you.

04:46.671 --> 04:49.188
- It's not dangerous.
- We still don't know for sure.

04:49.372 --> 04:51.406
Nicole's fine with
you going there now. And,

04:51.506 --> 04:54.871
you said they're just a group
of smart kids that like science.

04:54.971 --> 04:56.692
I want to be a part of that.

04:58.258 --> 04:59.074
Please.

04:59.759 --> 05:02.313
I need to feel like
I'm a part of something.

05:04.181 --> 05:05.512
I'll talk to Cassidy.

05:06.790 --> 05:09.123
I'm well aware of Jessi's gifts,

05:09.223 --> 05:11.573
but I also know that she's
volatile and unpredictable.

05:11.673 --> 05:13.314
She's trying to change.

05:14.630 --> 05:16.148
She is who she is.

05:16.316 --> 05:19.517
And I can't risk
disrupting the harmony

05:19.617 --> 05:21.621
of a very select
group of students.

05:21.721 --> 05:24.198
So you consider Nate
to be a harmonious person?

05:25.507 --> 05:28.007
I'm not saying
he's not a challenge. But...

05:29.497 --> 05:31.156
- Jessi...
- What?

05:34.292 --> 05:36.085
Her mother's no friend of Latnok.

05:37.260 --> 05:38.963
What do you know about Sarah?

05:40.018 --> 05:42.446
I know she's an
extraordinary person.

05:43.437 --> 05:45.359
But I also know that
she's headstrong

05:45.459 --> 05:47.296
and contentious.
And...

05:47.783 --> 05:50.599
- doesn't share our vision.
- Well, Jessi's not her mother.

05:51.099 --> 05:52.581
She wants to be here,

05:52.681 --> 05:53.929
to participate.

05:55.281 --> 05:56.605
I'll vouch for her.

05:59.548 --> 06:01.485
In that case, how can I say no?

06:03.118 --> 06:03.988
Thank you.

06:05.119 --> 06:06.309
You're welcome.

06:09.526 --> 06:12.682
I'm totally wiped, but playing tourist
was exactly what I needed.

06:12.782 --> 06:15.317
Just a reminder
of what Seattle has to offer.

06:16.898 --> 06:18.775
I'm really gonna miss it.

06:18.875 --> 06:21.941
I wouldn't worry. I'm sure
Cleveland has a Space Needle.

06:22.000 --> 06:22.841
Josh...

06:22.943 --> 06:24.349
And a Pike's Market.

06:24.769 --> 06:26.671
Are you really gonna do this?

06:26.771 --> 06:28.679
What? Is it my fault
Cleveland is so lame?

06:29.161 --> 06:30.749
Why are you ruining such a great day?

06:30.906 --> 06:32.803
Why are you ruining such
a great relationship?

06:32.903 --> 06:34.190
Like I have a choice!

06:34.290 --> 06:36.345
You know this is hard for me, too.

06:37.607 --> 06:40.482
I really don't need you piling on
the guilt, making me feel even worse.

06:41.233 --> 06:43.861
Sure. Yeah. Bail on me, just like
you're bailing on Seattle.

06:44.538 --> 06:45.416
Idiot!

06:52.954 --> 06:56.331
This is quite an occasion. You're just
in time to receive your assignments.

06:56.678 --> 06:58.225
Since when do
we get assignments?

06:58.325 --> 07:00.619
Since we have a very important
project underway,

07:00.795 --> 07:03.714
the preparations for which
are strictly confidential.

07:05.481 --> 07:06.587
It's a party.

07:08.018 --> 07:09.610
- A party?
- That's right.

07:09.710 --> 07:12.323
We throw one every year
for members from other schools.

07:12.423 --> 07:15.017
Jackie-licious, you are
in charge of the guest list.

07:15.185 --> 07:16.769
Mr. Deejay, music.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.547
Anger Management,
libations.

07:18.708 --> 07:21.065
And our two newest members, you,

07:21.233 --> 07:23.091
are in charge of the "wow."

07:23.191 --> 07:24.651
- The wow?
- The wow.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.951
The idea behind the party,
the theme.

07:27.051 --> 07:29.327
I want it to combine
social interaction

07:29.427 --> 07:30.574
with science.

07:30.863 --> 07:32.578
You'll work on it together.

07:32.832 --> 07:36.663
With your two minds, I'm sure
you'll come up with something fabulous.

07:38.522 --> 07:39.462
A party?

07:39.986 --> 07:42.132
You're supposed to be getting
the dirt on these people,

07:42.232 --> 07:43.851
and you're throwing a party with them?

07:43.951 --> 07:45.654
Maybe there's no dirt to get.

07:45.754 --> 07:46.585
And...

07:47.432 --> 07:49.718
if there's not, then I can
finally tell Amanda how I feel.

07:49.886 --> 07:52.295
Which is what I want,
more than anything.

07:52.993 --> 07:55.816
- How are you doing?
- I'm excellent. How are you?

07:56.899 --> 07:58.503
Dude, there's not much you can do now.

07:58.603 --> 08:00.258
I can't just stand here.

08:00.603 --> 08:02.658
- Amanda.
- Hi.

08:02.890 --> 08:04.650
Can I get a cup of coffee?

08:05.363 --> 08:09.700
- Kyle, you don't drink coffee.
- I know. It's just for...

08:11.755 --> 08:14.153
Hey, it looks like
you two need to talk.

08:15.223 --> 08:17.452
Do you want to
talk about something?

08:18.378 --> 08:19.665
Not right now.

08:22.417 --> 08:25.009
- Well, then, what were you saying?
- I was asking.

08:25.109 --> 08:26.771
Right. And my answer is yes.

08:26.871 --> 08:29.675
- Yes? Yes to what?
- Kyle, it's none of your business.

08:30.560 --> 08:33.729
Amanda just accepted my invitation
to our party this weekend.

08:33.828 --> 08:34.953
"Our" party?

08:35.982 --> 08:37.522
What do you have to do with it?

08:37.621 --> 08:40.635
I'm working with a group of students
at the U-Dub Science Department.

08:40.735 --> 08:42.693
So, you two know each other?

08:43.534 --> 08:44.773
Is that a problem?

08:44.941 --> 08:45.983
- No.
- Yes.

08:46.984 --> 08:48.970
It doesn't work this way.
You can't interfere.

08:49.070 --> 08:49.940
Except

08:50.458 --> 08:52.564
the party he's talking about, it's

08:52.664 --> 08:54.411
a party for single people.

08:54.573 --> 08:55.367
What?

08:55.705 --> 08:57.544
You can't bring a date.
That's the rule.

08:57.644 --> 08:59.580
- Since when?
- That's okay.

08:59.873 --> 09:03.045
I'm single, you're single.
Maybe we'll run into each other.

09:03.412 --> 09:04.866
I'll make sure of it.

09:06.237 --> 09:08.130
Meeting you
was a coincidence.

09:08.298 --> 09:10.973
It had nothing to do with
getting Kyle to join Latnok.

09:11.073 --> 09:14.595
It still seems like creepy,
undercover, double agent crap.

09:14.763 --> 09:18.111
Yeah, I admit we're secretive
about our membership, but,

09:19.654 --> 09:22.144
I want you, Lori, for you.

09:25.015 --> 09:27.190
I don't know. Something
tells me you got off

09:27.290 --> 09:29.945
running around
like some nerdy James Bond.

09:30.045 --> 09:30.988
Well...

09:32.004 --> 09:34.530
I guess if anything
I kind of saw myself as a...

09:34.630 --> 09:36.859
as a somewhat
less nerdy Moby.

09:37.776 --> 09:38.994
You wish!

09:41.145 --> 09:43.233
How could Amanda want to
go out with such a...

09:43.333 --> 09:44.390
such a jerk?

09:44.853 --> 09:46.127
Language, please.

09:48.410 --> 09:49.227
What?

09:49.467 --> 09:50.504
Jealous Kyle.

09:50.604 --> 09:52.457
It's a whole new side of you.
I like it.

09:52.557 --> 09:53.926
I'm not jealous. I'm...

09:55.014 --> 09:57.638
Okay, I am, but it's more than
that. Nate's not a good person.

09:58.042 --> 10:00.733
- Well, if he's such a dirtbag...
- Hot dirtbag.

10:00.833 --> 10:03.393
let her go out with him.
Amanda will wise up.

10:03.674 --> 10:07.170
Yeah, 'cause it's not like she has
a history of dating hot dirtbags.

10:07.270 --> 10:10.317
Exhibit A, Charlie Tanner.
I swear, I'm trying to help.

10:10.485 --> 10:12.608
- Well, stop.
- No, Lori's right.

10:12.708 --> 10:14.498
Amanda always sees the best in people,

10:14.598 --> 10:16.767
and I don't want Nate
to take advantage of her.

10:17.030 --> 10:19.312
I have to work on ideas
for this party.

10:20.992 --> 10:22.663
- He's screwed.
- Totally.

10:23.592 --> 10:24.408
Heya.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.208
We can throw an ice party.

10:26.376 --> 10:29.494
We can have everyone dress in
white like at Diddy's parties.

10:29.594 --> 10:32.448
- Diddy?
- I've been reading Lori's magazines.

10:34.425 --> 10:36.883
Jessi, I'm sorry. I know you want
to impress everyone, but

10:36.983 --> 10:38.387
my head's just not in it.

10:39.869 --> 10:41.025
Because of Amanda?

10:41.125 --> 10:43.387
He's not right for her!
Why can't she see that?

10:43.487 --> 10:44.507
Stabilize.

10:45.675 --> 10:46.442
What?

10:47.920 --> 10:49.940
Tell me how Amanda
makes you feel.

10:50.438 --> 10:51.733
Jessi, I can't do that.

10:52.024 --> 10:52.821
Why?

10:52.921 --> 10:55.158
Cause I shouldn't talk to you
about things like that.

10:55.258 --> 10:56.154
Why not?

10:56.458 --> 10:57.582
We're friends.

10:57.968 --> 10:59.950
I was just confused, remember?

11:03.861 --> 11:05.789
Are you sure that's what it was?

11:08.637 --> 11:09.878
You have Amanda,

11:09.978 --> 11:13.038
so you understand the difference
between friendship and love.

11:14.001 --> 11:15.966
I just don't
understand it yet.

11:16.528 --> 11:17.384
Help me.

11:23.919 --> 11:24.850
Well...

11:27.920 --> 11:30.814
The first time I saw her,
my heart started pounding.

11:31.617 --> 11:33.812
I felt shaky
and lightheaded.

11:35.117 --> 11:36.657
My palms got sweaty.

11:37.902 --> 11:40.657
Well, that sounds like
a chemical reaction.

11:41.071 --> 11:42.830
When body chemistry matches,

11:42.930 --> 11:45.097
the pheromones are naturally
drawn to each other.

11:45.197 --> 11:46.416
Makes sense.

11:46.516 --> 11:48.206
I didn't feel that with you.

11:49.748 --> 11:51.752
- You didn't?
- I don't think so.

11:53.382 --> 11:54.180
No,

11:54.399 --> 11:55.598
definitely not.

11:56.738 --> 11:59.051
Do you think Amanda
felt that with Nate?

12:00.602 --> 12:02.819
I don't know.
I can't just ask her.

12:03.179 --> 12:06.218
Well, it would help if you knew
they had true chemistry.

12:08.857 --> 12:11.742
You should test their
physiological compatibility.

12:11.842 --> 12:15.035
If they have no chemistry,
you have nothing to worry about.

12:17.924 --> 12:18.982
The party.

12:19.200 --> 12:20.405
What about it?

12:22.299 --> 12:24.439
We could call it
a chemistry party.

12:24.784 --> 12:28.066
Where people can get matched based
on their physiological compatibility.

12:28.166 --> 12:30.427
- Is this our wow?
- It's our wow.

12:30.919 --> 12:33.234
It's exactly what I need
to prove to Amanda

12:33.260 --> 12:35.921
that she and Nate aren't
meant to be together.

12:41.023 --> 12:43.095
- What's this?
- A mood ring.

12:43.719 --> 12:46.918
You put it on, it tells you if
you're in a good mood or a bad one.

12:47.018 --> 12:49.039
You don't need a ring
to tell you that.

12:49.139 --> 12:51.406
It's so other people can see.

12:52.161 --> 12:54.564
- How does it work?
- Reads your body temperature.

12:54.938 --> 12:56.270
If you're in a good mood,

12:56.370 --> 12:58.653
your temperature's slightly up,
causing a bright color.

12:58.753 --> 12:59.986
If you're in a bad one

13:00.086 --> 13:02.155
your temperature's down,
and the color's dark.

13:05.928 --> 13:09.119
So how would this prove
if two people are compatible?

13:09.219 --> 13:11.751
We can design something to read
a person's pheromone levels,

13:11.851 --> 13:13.998
and produce a color
based on its results.

13:14.098 --> 13:16.933
So if two people have the same
color, they're a good match.

13:17.033 --> 13:19.548
If they're not the same color,
they're not a good match.

13:19.954 --> 13:21.183
DNA dating?

13:21.650 --> 13:22.450
Cool.

13:22.717 --> 13:24.580
But I need to test it first.

13:25.145 --> 13:28.676
I need to confirm that Amanda and Nate
are two different colors.

13:28.883 --> 13:30.100
How can I help?

13:30.483 --> 13:32.936
I need DNA samples
from both of them.

13:35.199 --> 13:38.084
I can distract Nate while you
grab something from his desk.

13:38.184 --> 13:40.777
- That's perfect.
- Wait. What about Amanda?

13:42.056 --> 13:44.013
I've already got someone
taking care of it.

13:44.782 --> 13:46.085
What the hell are you doing?

13:46.185 --> 13:47.745
What am I doing?
What are you doing?

13:47.845 --> 13:50.065
I'm preventing someone
from finding hair in their smoothie.

13:50.165 --> 13:52.774
What are you talking about? My hair
has never ended up in a smoothie.

13:52.874 --> 13:54.744
Not yet.
But the moment it does,

13:54.844 --> 13:57.131
we kiss our A rating goodbye.
You want that to happen?

13:57.231 --> 13:58.795
- No, but...
- But nothing.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.474
Keep it in check, Bloom.

14:00.574 --> 14:03.197
Don't make me institute
a hair net policy.

14:08.229 --> 14:09.848
It's so great to finally meet you.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.411
I mean, I know we said
we'd meet at the party tomorrow,

14:12.511 --> 14:14.830
but I just couldn't wait.
Can you believe it?

14:14.930 --> 14:16.821
We're finally standing
in front of each other.

14:16.921 --> 14:19.483
Are you freaking out?
I'm totally, totally freaking out.

14:20.691 --> 14:21.789
Freaking out.

14:22.503 --> 14:24.371
- Who are you?
- It's me.

14:24.649 --> 14:27.157
Kbug223.
From Coolzone?

14:27.949 --> 14:28.825
Coolzone?

14:30.859 --> 14:33.722
We've only spent the past week
chatting about everything

14:33.822 --> 14:36.083
from G-Force
to Cabbage Patch dolls.

14:36.183 --> 14:37.310
Keep it down.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.586
What? I think
it's adorable you had one.

14:39.754 --> 14:41.429
How do you know all this stuff about me?

14:41.529 --> 14:42.750
You told me, silly.

14:42.850 --> 14:45.600
Look, I gotta go,
but I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

15:03.624 --> 15:05.577
- Hey, Nate.
- Hi, New Girl.

15:05.800 --> 15:06.900
Jessi.

15:07.896 --> 15:11.008
You're good at decrypting
computer code, right?

15:11.108 --> 15:13.636
Ah, you heard of
Gates, Allen, Jobs...

15:13.736 --> 15:14.628
Morons.

15:16.454 --> 15:18.910
Well, I thought you might
be able to help me out

15:19.010 --> 15:21.111
with a little problem I've been having.

15:21.427 --> 15:23.797
Why don't you just get
your boy to do it?

15:24.244 --> 15:26.052
Because you're smarter.

15:29.866 --> 15:32.109
- Yeah, I can spare a minute.
- Great.

15:47.861 --> 15:50.865
Yeah, I'm on my way out
the door. I'll see you in 20.

16:47.346 --> 16:48.731
Looking for me?

16:51.642 --> 16:54.262
I just wanted to thank you for
letting Jessi be part of this.

16:54.430 --> 16:58.165
Well, she seems to be getting
along with everyone so far.

16:58.671 --> 17:00.935
Your plans for the party
going well?

17:01.035 --> 17:03.089
I think we came up
with something interesting.

17:03.189 --> 17:05.857
Good.
I'm looking forward to it.

17:08.160 --> 17:09.794
Is there anything else?

17:10.852 --> 17:11.998
That's it.

17:22.969 --> 17:24.152
So... ?

17:24.544 --> 17:27.468
- I think I've properly stabilized.
- Excellent.

17:27.568 --> 17:30.371
- Step one is complete.
- Except...

17:30.960 --> 17:33.635
I think he still has feelings
for his ex-girlfriend.

17:33.803 --> 17:35.845
Exactly why
there's a step two.

17:38.261 --> 17:39.482
Neutralize.

17:39.716 --> 17:41.601
- Ditch the other chick.
- Ditch her?

17:41.769 --> 17:43.279
Remove the competition.

17:43.379 --> 17:44.686
Eliminate her.

17:45.383 --> 17:47.407
I didn't mean that literally.

17:47.732 --> 17:49.056
- I know.
- Seriously,

17:49.156 --> 17:51.338
don't go sneak up
behind her in a dark alley.

17:51.438 --> 17:53.753
Knocking her unconscious
is not an option.

17:53.853 --> 17:55.520
That was one time only.

17:55.620 --> 17:56.673
Lucky me.

17:56.995 --> 17:57.824
So...

17:59.271 --> 18:01.867
What's the best way for me
to neutralize her?

18:02.624 --> 18:03.946
I don't know.

18:04.674 --> 18:07.618
You're the super smart one.
You'll figure it out.

18:10.335 --> 18:13.041
Royal Grace Investments.
Whatever you can find.

18:14.450 --> 18:15.897
Thanks, Declan.

18:20.890 --> 18:22.179
- Hey.
- Hi.

18:22.478 --> 18:25.450
- How's it going?
- I think I figured it out.

18:27.988 --> 18:31.901
This crystal will change color based
on a person's pheromone output.

18:32.864 --> 18:34.780
We can make necklaces out of those.

18:34.880 --> 18:37.564
For people to wear, so
everyone can see their color.

18:37.664 --> 18:38.867
That's perfect.

18:41.010 --> 18:43.714
Let's try it out.
This is Nate's DNA.

18:44.503 --> 18:48.221
I'll put a drop on the crystal,
which should produce a color.

18:52.570 --> 18:53.506
It's green.

18:53.674 --> 18:55.509
And now Amanda's.

18:57.141 --> 18:59.304
Hopefully it's a different color.

19:02.865 --> 19:03.871
It's red.

19:07.056 --> 19:08.614
They're not a match.

19:09.359 --> 19:12.153
Now Amanda will think twice
about being with Nate.

19:12.253 --> 19:13.135
Great.

19:14.504 --> 19:16.154
So what's next?

19:16.571 --> 19:19.188
Everyone else at Latnok
seems genuine.

19:19.288 --> 19:21.826
But I'm still not convinced
about Cassidy.

19:22.395 --> 19:24.943
He's hiding something
in his office.

19:25.043 --> 19:26.019
Like what?

19:26.595 --> 19:27.781
I don't know.

19:28.135 --> 19:29.837
But once I check it out,

19:30.522 --> 19:31.767
if it's nothing,

19:32.275 --> 19:34.388
maybe I can get my life back.

19:36.787 --> 19:38.176
And hopefully Amanda.

19:49.478 --> 19:50.771
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:53.109 --> 19:54.727
- Can I get by?
- Sorry.

19:55.667 --> 19:58.443
Do you want to ride together
to the party?

19:58.883 --> 20:02.367
I need to get the necklaces ready.
You should just go with Josh and Lori.

20:02.535 --> 20:05.578
- Josh and Lori aren't coming.
- Yes, they are. I invited them.

20:05.746 --> 20:08.967
There's no way Nicole would let them go
to a party sponsored by Latnok.

20:09.067 --> 20:11.209
She and Stephen are gone
until later tonight.

20:11.474 --> 20:13.467
Jessi, you have
to uninvite them.

20:13.567 --> 20:15.605
I'm not uninviting them.

20:16.299 --> 20:18.875
They've just started to tolerate me.
I don't want to be

20:18.975 --> 20:21.003
Downer-Doug-Party-Police.

20:21.238 --> 20:22.390
What's that?

20:22.490 --> 20:24.130
That's what they call you.

20:24.230 --> 20:25.906
- They do?
- Yes.

20:28.937 --> 20:31.679
But feel free
to uninvite them yourself.

20:32.149 --> 20:33.273
If you want to.

20:34.947 --> 20:36.148
Never mind.

20:41.763 --> 20:43.053
Drop the controller.

20:43.153 --> 20:45.247
I thought we were
playing G-Force today.

20:45.347 --> 20:48.327
Not until you tell me who
that stalker was at The Rack.

20:50.871 --> 20:52.375
She seemed very cool.

20:53.228 --> 20:55.169
- Are you insane?
- Practical.

20:56.712 --> 20:58.756
I want to make sure
you have someone after I move.

20:58.924 --> 21:02.710
Just because you're moving to Cleveland,
doesn't mean we have to be over.

21:07.264 --> 21:09.715
What's your favorite part
of our relationship?

21:10.203 --> 21:11.684
I don't know.
I mean,

21:12.091 --> 21:14.063
just being around you, I guess.

21:14.575 --> 21:16.522
Well, your favorite part
of our relationship

21:16.622 --> 21:18.162
will no longer be able to happen.

21:18.262 --> 21:21.325
- Then I'll find a new favorite.
- Josh, I'm moving.

21:21.425 --> 21:24.574
Whether you accept it or not,
it's happening.

21:25.393 --> 21:27.076
You have to let me go.

21:31.123 --> 21:34.435
You know, I thought you'd be
the one fighting to keep us together.

21:34.535 --> 21:35.828
Guess I was wrong.

21:35.928 --> 21:38.394
You're not looking at this
the right way.

21:38.494 --> 21:39.587
I am now.

21:42.861 --> 21:44.980
- Where are you going?
- To call Katie

21:45.080 --> 21:47.847
and ask her what time
I should pick her up tonight.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.813
Turns out Royal Grace Investments
own the building

21:55.913 --> 21:58.385
where Cassidy and Jessi
have an apartment.

21:58.485 --> 21:59.869
Check this out.

21:59.969 --> 22:02.089
It's the lease to Cassidy's place.

22:02.189 --> 22:03.424
How'd you get this?

22:03.524 --> 22:05.593
Called pretending to be
from my dad's law firm.

22:05.693 --> 22:07.181
Check the date it was signed.

22:07.281 --> 22:09.369
Cassidy moved in
the same day Sarah took off.

22:09.469 --> 22:11.087
You don't think
it's coincidence?

22:11.187 --> 22:13.406
Is anything in your life
ever just a coincidence?

22:16.026 --> 22:17.650
Someone's excited.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.698
Does that mean what I think it means?

22:19.798 --> 22:22.695
- Step two complete.
- That was fast.

22:22.976 --> 22:25.802
- I promise I didn't hit anyone.
- Glad to hear it.

22:26.827 --> 22:28.564
So, I've stabilized.

22:28.848 --> 22:30.342
I've neutralized.

22:30.442 --> 22:33.075
- Now I can get him.
- Not quite.

22:34.511 --> 22:36.338
What's wrong?
Do I not look okay?

22:36.529 --> 22:38.982
No, you look great.
Just not hot.

22:40.562 --> 22:42.073
It's time for step three.

22:42.173 --> 22:45.571
- There's a step three?
- You need to "sexify."

22:46.045 --> 22:47.615
I definitely
don't know how to do...

22:47.715 --> 22:48.742
Follow me.

23:03.933 --> 23:05.824
Chemistry party. It's genius.

23:05.924 --> 23:07.588
These necklaces are awesome.

23:07.688 --> 23:09.689
Never seen so many people
happy to be single.

23:09.789 --> 23:11.241
I'm glad it all worked out.

23:11.341 --> 23:13.763
- Have you seen Nate?
- I think he's over at the bar.

23:13.863 --> 23:15.116
Thanks, Mark.

23:21.302 --> 23:24.110
Kyle. You know,
I have to say, good job.

23:25.039 --> 23:26.487
- Thanks.
- Hey, Kyle.

23:28.250 --> 23:29.365
Your necklace,

23:30.732 --> 23:31.896
it's green.

23:32.404 --> 23:33.913
Yeah, isn't it amazing?

23:34.013 --> 23:36.036
Amanda and I are a perfect match.

23:53.165 --> 23:56.434
I think Nate did something to the
necklaces. I have to tell Amanda.

23:56.602 --> 23:59.409
- Don't forget why you're here.
- I haven't.

23:59.509 --> 24:02.015
That's why I have to tell her
what kind of person he is.

24:02.115 --> 24:05.109
No, what you need to do
is get into Cassidy's office.

24:10.184 --> 24:11.659
Looking for Kyle?

24:13.032 --> 24:14.410
Was I that obvious?

24:17.831 --> 24:20.875
Whatever happened between you,
he was crazy to let you go.

24:21.313 --> 24:22.430
He didn't.

24:23.791 --> 24:25.832
I caught him kissing
someone else.

24:25.932 --> 24:27.022
I'm sorry.

24:28.355 --> 24:30.802
You deserve someone
who appreciates you.

24:31.535 --> 24:34.342
- It's hard to see them together.
- I know it is,

24:34.442 --> 24:36.457
but you can't waste this opportunity.

24:36.557 --> 24:38.226
You have a chance to end this,

24:38.326 --> 24:40.598
and know once and for all
where Cassidy stands.

24:41.659 --> 24:44.514
He's over there.
Keep an eye on him.

24:45.011 --> 24:47.331
And I'll keep
the other one on Amanda.

25:05.114 --> 25:07.046
Jessi, you look beautiful.

25:07.424 --> 25:08.589
Thank you.

25:11.922 --> 25:13.603
Ours don't work.

25:13.960 --> 25:17.246
I guess our body chemistry
reacts differently in some way.

25:20.203 --> 25:23.728
I think Nate may have done
something to affect the results.

25:23.828 --> 25:24.730
How?

25:26.025 --> 25:27.828
We'll figure it out later.

25:29.143 --> 25:30.194
I have to go.

25:39.950 --> 25:42.039
- Unbelievable.
- What?

25:42.805 --> 25:45.669
- She's not into Cassidy at all.
- Who, Jessi?

25:45.960 --> 25:48.004
No. She's totally into Kyle.

25:48.172 --> 25:51.716
- Everyone can see that.
- Well, apparently, not everyone.

25:54.627 --> 25:55.939
I know.

25:56.039 --> 25:58.411
I'm an embarrassing
shade of lavender.

25:59.416 --> 26:02.590
We're not gonna let our lives be
dictated by these little crystals?

26:02.690 --> 26:03.895
No, we are not.

26:36.102 --> 26:37.632
You're a yellow.

26:38.255 --> 26:39.645
What do you know?

26:39.745 --> 26:41.682
- I'm Jackie.
- Declan.

26:42.731 --> 26:44.606
Can I be honest, Declan?

26:44.706 --> 26:45.770
Go right ahead.

26:46.890 --> 26:49.735
I've had some bad luck
with guys the past...

26:49.998 --> 26:51.472
...five or six years.

26:51.904 --> 26:54.956
I was gonna come here,
grab a few, then

26:55.056 --> 26:58.699
head home early and pass out after
a bowl of coffee ice cream.

26:59.133 --> 27:01.456
Well, that sounds
pretty honest to me.

27:01.556 --> 27:03.687
So, my question is,

27:03.787 --> 27:06.207
are you a good guy,
or am I just wasting my time?

27:07.209 --> 27:09.556
Well,
can I be honest with you?

27:10.307 --> 27:12.838
I'm about 80 percent
good guy.

27:14.120 --> 27:15.894
Those are pretty good odds.

27:18.046 --> 27:21.410
Excuse me. Jackie, have you
seen Kyle around at all?

27:21.510 --> 27:25.032
- Yeah. I think I just saw him...
- Outside. Getting some air.

27:25.576 --> 27:27.022
Great. Thanks.

27:28.675 --> 27:30.647
I think we need some refills.

28:43.283 --> 28:44.494
He's coming.

28:59.202 --> 29:01.117
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

29:01.217 --> 29:04.851
Great. It's just been a long time since
I've been out with anyone but my girlfriend.

29:05.860 --> 29:07.493
If it makes you feel better,

29:07.593 --> 29:10.431
you're the first guy I've gone out
with since Brett dumped me on IM.

29:10.531 --> 29:12.634
- He dumped you by IM?
- Yeah.

29:13.497 --> 29:16.304
I avoided computers
for two weeks after that.

29:17.056 --> 29:19.859
But I'm glad I didn't hang up
my keyboard forever, 'cause,

29:19.959 --> 29:23.018
you know, if I had,
I would have never met you.

29:23.679 --> 29:25.899
And hey, look.
You're blue

29:26.434 --> 29:27.617
and I'm blue.

29:29.260 --> 29:32.405
So what do you say we forget
about the exes and have fun?

29:33.860 --> 29:34.805
Yeah.

29:34.900 --> 29:36.853
- Great, let's go.
- Okay.

29:38.439 --> 29:40.547
So did you find anything?

29:51.959 --> 29:54.375
- What are you doing?
- Get away from her.

29:54.543 --> 29:56.580
He's only using you
to get back at me.

29:56.680 --> 29:59.713
Man, your ego is showing. He's just
jealous because we have a connection.

29:59.881 --> 30:01.531
No, you don't.
Not like we do.

30:01.631 --> 30:03.634
Our party favors that
you made say that we do.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.999
Cause you tampered with them!
You did something to

30:06.099 --> 30:08.248
Amanda's necklace to make
her think you're compatible.

30:08.348 --> 30:09.831
- The hell, I did.
- He did it.

30:09.931 --> 30:12.229
- How do you know that?
- I tested them.

30:12.329 --> 30:14.315
Your necklace should be red, not green.

30:14.415 --> 30:16.808
You don't have chemistry.
Your colors shouldn't match.

30:16.908 --> 30:18.169
And ours should?

30:18.552 --> 30:19.817
Is that your point?

30:20.454 --> 30:23.612
Chemistry is not about
some stupid color on a necklace.

30:23.869 --> 30:26.323
It's about what you feel
in your heart!

30:26.892 --> 30:29.268
You used to know that
better than anyone.

30:29.822 --> 30:32.714
I guess you're not as smart
as I thought you were.

30:34.261 --> 30:35.567
I have to go!

30:38.797 --> 30:41.454
You really know
how to spoil a good time.

30:47.692 --> 30:49.041
<i>Amanda was right.</i>

30:49.640 --> 30:52.988
<i>The laws of science don't apply
to matters of the heart.</i>

30:53.197 --> 30:55.548
<i>But jealousy had clouded my thinking.</i>

30:56.011 --> 30:58.864
<i>True chemistry can't be
forced or manipulated.</i>

30:59.324 --> 31:02.676
<i>And a genuine relationship
can only be built or restored</i>

31:02.776 --> 31:04.873
<i>with honesty and mutual respect.</i>

31:05.681 --> 31:06.982
<i>I failed Amanda.</i>

31:07.717 --> 31:08.917
<i>I'd failed us.</i>

31:18.305 --> 31:21.587
- You are an incredible liar.
- Excuse me?

31:21.755 --> 31:25.045
Oh, please. Don't play all
Martha Stewart pre-jail with me.

31:25.217 --> 31:27.903
It was never about Cassidy.
It was always Kyle!

31:28.893 --> 31:30.390
I didn't know what to do.

31:30.490 --> 31:33.143
Until messing with Amanda's
necklace came to mind.

31:33.243 --> 31:35.771
You told me to neutralize.
Ditch the other chick.

31:35.957 --> 31:38.896
That was before I knew
the other chick was Amanda.

31:40.191 --> 31:43.442
Your advice would have been different
if you knew she was the other girl?

31:43.849 --> 31:45.361
Of course. She's my friend.

31:46.571 --> 31:48.489
- Look, Jessi...
- I'm sorry.

31:49.726 --> 31:51.784
I can't change how I feel about Kyle.

31:52.963 --> 31:56.038
Maybe not, but if you want any
hope of him caring about you,

31:56.138 --> 31:58.207
you'd better be somebody
worth caring about.

31:58.375 --> 32:00.694
Kyle deserves someone
a hell of a lot better

32:00.794 --> 32:03.724
than someone who would pull
this crap behind his back.

32:08.135 --> 32:10.902
You know, I'm having
a really great time tonight.

32:11.861 --> 32:12.680
Me too.

32:20.508 --> 32:21.480
I'm sorry.

32:23.820 --> 32:26.323
As much as I want to, I can't.

32:27.423 --> 32:28.238
But...

32:29.786 --> 32:32.449
I don't understand. I thought
everything was going great.

32:33.396 --> 32:34.341
It is.

32:36.941 --> 32:39.412
I mean, you're a
perfect match for me.

32:42.917 --> 32:44.433
But I already have one.

32:50.981 --> 32:52.489
You all right, mate?

32:52.589 --> 32:53.554
I'm fine.

32:54.195 --> 32:56.849
I wanted to talk to you about
something, about the jewelry.

32:58.076 --> 33:00.818
- The jewelry?
- The reimbursement for the necklaces.

33:00.918 --> 33:02.521
This should take care of it.

33:04.911 --> 33:05.935
Thanks.

33:06.473 --> 33:08.068
It's a raging success.

33:08.168 --> 33:11.105
I guess you and Jessi are
an unbeatable combination.

33:11.353 --> 33:12.531
Congratulations.

33:17.974 --> 33:19.443
So what did you find?

33:21.833 --> 33:24.607
Sarah's ring was in his safe.
Which makes me wonder

33:24.707 --> 33:27.555
- what he had to do to get it.
- You sure it was Sarah's ring?

33:27.655 --> 33:29.105
Adam gave it to her.

33:29.205 --> 33:31.681
It has a red stone,
and it's one of a kind.

33:32.471 --> 33:34.499
You were right not to trust him.

33:35.672 --> 33:38.331
You know, I really didn't
want to find anything.

33:40.611 --> 33:42.498
I was really hoping that...

33:44.700 --> 33:46.357
I can't get my life back.

33:48.225 --> 33:49.805
I can't be with Amanda.

33:54.225 --> 33:55.205
Wow...

33:56.483 --> 33:58.814
Guess our non-date
ended that badly, huh?

33:59.098 --> 34:01.836
You'd rather work the
night shift than be with me?

34:02.474 --> 34:04.546
I was just helping myself to a cup.

34:05.752 --> 34:06.959
Do you want one?

34:07.187 --> 34:08.554
It's on the house.

34:09.326 --> 34:10.422
No, thanks.

34:11.487 --> 34:13.156
Can I ask you something?

34:13.255 --> 34:14.429
Yeah, sure.

34:17.103 --> 34:18.367
Was Kyle right?

34:19.599 --> 34:22.032
Did you only ask me out
to get back at him?

34:23.908 --> 34:25.135
Absolute truth?

34:25.938 --> 34:26.938
At first, yes.

34:28.733 --> 34:31.755
The thing is, once we were there,
I had a really great time.

34:31.856 --> 34:32.793
Me, too.

34:34.701 --> 34:36.161
Good night, Amanda.

34:36.763 --> 34:37.766
Good night.

34:41.039 --> 34:42.790
- Jessi.
- Nate.

34:43.039 --> 34:44.790
Please, Jessi, leave me alone.

34:46.583 --> 34:48.001
I'm sorry about tonight.

34:48.893 --> 34:51.045
For once you weren't
the one responsible.

34:52.168 --> 34:53.228
Yes, I am.

34:55.734 --> 34:57.703
I messed with your necklace.

34:57.992 --> 35:00.282
I wanted you to get together
with Nate.

35:00.382 --> 35:01.217
Why?

35:01.939 --> 35:04.685
Because if you were with him,
then I could...

35:06.104 --> 35:07.813
You could be with Kyle.

35:12.255 --> 35:14.324
But it doesn't matter what I do.

35:15.392 --> 35:18.574
Even if you were with Nate, Kyle
would still want to be with you.

35:19.737 --> 35:21.410
And you want to be with him.

35:22.640 --> 35:25.801
I see the way you watch him
when you know he's not looking.

35:26.888 --> 35:28.333
You still love him.

35:30.579 --> 35:31.896
It doesn't matter.

35:33.071 --> 35:35.257
I can't let myself get hurt again.

35:37.793 --> 35:40.246
Forget what you think
you know about him.

35:41.417 --> 35:44.242
All he's ever done is love you
with his whole heart.

35:45.304 --> 35:46.852
Why are you telling me this?

35:47.819 --> 35:49.489
Because I care about him.

35:50.575 --> 35:54.265
And you told me when you care about
somebody, you put their needs first.

35:55.193 --> 35:56.403
Kyle needs you,

35:57.892 --> 36:00.314
so I won't be
getting in your way anymore.

36:07.374 --> 36:09.889
Honestly, I have never seen
a group of grown people

36:09.900 --> 36:11.982
act like a bigger bunch of babies.

36:12.082 --> 36:14.387
Jealousy makes people
do crazy things.

36:14.487 --> 36:15.611
I guess.

36:15.711 --> 36:18.734
Maybe I'd just hoped we were all
a more evolved species.

36:19.886 --> 36:22.840
Do I need to remind you we're talking
about a bunch of teenagers?

36:22.940 --> 36:25.871
Okay, you are so not allowed
to pull age rank on me.

36:25.971 --> 36:29.061
I'm the one who handled
this whole evening properly.

36:29.229 --> 36:30.229
With class.

36:30.934 --> 36:31.939
And poise.

36:32.379 --> 36:34.942
- And maturity beyond your years.
- Exactly.

36:35.110 --> 36:37.069
- Good night, Mark.
- Hey, do you need a ride home?

36:37.799 --> 36:39.373
Actually, no. I...

36:39.473 --> 36:41.001
I sort of have one.

36:41.859 --> 36:43.173
You ready to go?

36:48.805 --> 36:49.692
Cute.

36:54.591 --> 36:56.141
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

37:00.969 --> 37:02.495
- You're an idiot.
- I'm an idiot.

37:02.595 --> 37:04.839
I can't believe I thought I could
handle is gonna make up

37:04.939 --> 37:07.558
for the fact my current girlfriend
is moving? You're a bigger idiot.

37:07.726 --> 37:09.538
See her again, I'll kill you. Dead.

37:18.852 --> 37:19.901
I panicked.

37:22.169 --> 37:24.807
I couldn't figure out
how to pack you up and

37:24.907 --> 37:27.329
ship you to Cleveland
with the rest of my stuff.

37:27.429 --> 37:30.247
You try Pack-N-Ship on Third?
They have great rates.

37:36.699 --> 37:37.921
I'm sorry.

37:40.160 --> 37:41.216
I love you.

37:43.232 --> 37:44.804
You know that, right?

37:50.154 --> 37:51.361
Of course you do.

37:52.421 --> 37:53.529
Who wouldn't?

37:59.722 --> 38:01.320
I love you, too.

38:12.332 --> 38:13.193
Kyle?

38:14.214 --> 38:15.280
Amanda, I...

38:16.461 --> 38:18.378
I didn't think you'd want to see me.

38:20.342 --> 38:22.265
I don't want to be mad anymore.

38:23.348 --> 38:25.385
I feel like that's
all I've been lately.

38:28.307 --> 38:30.641
I'm so confused about
what to think of you.

38:32.458 --> 38:36.035
And the only thing I can do
to get through it is to follow my heart.

38:37.254 --> 38:39.650
My heart says that
there's still something there.

38:43.936 --> 38:45.431
Please say something.

38:50.400 --> 38:51.331
Amanda...

38:53.579 --> 38:55.531
This person I am,

38:56.825 --> 38:58.853
this life I lead, it's...

38:59.929 --> 39:02.486
it's different
than anyone else's.

39:03.988 --> 39:05.143
I'm different.

39:05.943 --> 39:07.164
I know that.

39:07.436 --> 39:08.804
You know some of it.

39:10.427 --> 39:13.118
But there are things
that I could never tell you.

39:14.170 --> 39:16.019
And people who want things from me,

39:16.417 --> 39:19.481
who know that the way to get to me
is through the people I love.

39:21.006 --> 39:23.026
What does that mean,
"get to you?"

39:25.553 --> 39:28.573
It means that as much as I want
us to be together, we can't.

39:31.359 --> 39:33.328
Why does that get to be your choice?

39:34.676 --> 39:37.124
Because my choice is to protect you.

39:38.807 --> 39:39.710
Always.

39:40.957 --> 39:43.004
You don't need to protect me.

39:44.086 --> 39:46.299
What you need to do is explain.

39:51.009 --> 39:52.070
I'm sorry.

39:53.578 --> 39:54.641
But I can't.

40:22.462 --> 40:23.865
Is something wrong?

40:30.073 --> 40:31.428
I found something.

40:32.942 --> 40:34.576
In Cassidy's office.

40:40.650 --> 40:42.332
He has Sarah's ring.

40:43.157 --> 40:44.013
What?

40:44.580 --> 40:45.549
How?

40:45.902 --> 40:49.180
I don't know, but I think it might have
something to do with her disappearance.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.323
No, she didn't disappear.
She left.

40:51.592 --> 40:54.046
- I know we both thought that, but...
- No.

40:57.133 --> 40:58.750
How do you explain this?

41:00.017 --> 41:02.793
The letter she left?
The checks she's been sending?

41:02.961 --> 41:04.244
I'm not sure.

41:17.213 --> 41:19.157
Cassidy gave me this.

41:19.257 --> 41:20.711
Look at the T's.

41:20.811 --> 41:23.021
The cross bars are identical
on all of them.

41:25.494 --> 41:27.442
The same person wrote all of this.

41:29.832 --> 41:31.387
Cassidy wrote this?

41:32.935 --> 41:34.191
And the letter?

41:36.035 --> 41:36.867
Why?

41:38.200 --> 41:39.453
I don't know.

41:41.874 --> 41:43.489
I can't believe this.

41:44.664 --> 41:47.420
All this time I thought she left
because she hated me.

41:47.974 --> 41:49.000
Jessi...

41:49.974 --> 41:51.675
No one could ever hate you.

41:55.847 --> 41:58.140
Jessi, please.
I hate seeing you like this.

42:00.747 --> 42:02.572
My mother didn't leave me.

42:03.582 --> 42:05.230
She didn't leave me!

42:06.056 --> 42:07.623
She didn't leave.

42:08.030 --> 42:09.539
I don't think she did.

42:13.977 --> 42:16.173
I need to find out
what happened to her.

42:16.750 --> 42:18.994
Promise me you'll help me find out.

42:22.055 --> 42:23.039
I promise.
