Previously on "Alias":

00:02.068 --> 00:04.662
- Sydney!
- Nadia!

00:04.738 --> 00:07.070
Come here, come here!

00:08.007 --> 00:09.305
(screams)

00:09.376 --> 00:11.367
It's Nadia, she's infected!

00:11.978 --> 00:16.108
My daughter is in a coma, suffering from
a condition that no one understands.

00:16.181 --> 00:19.879
It is a condition that I am responsible for,
with no hope for a cure.

00:19.953 --> 00:22.854
I've hurt the most precious thing in my life.

00:22.922 --> 00:26.187
Gordon Dean,
Office of Special lnvestigations.

00:26.259 --> 00:29.786
Dean wasn't Special lnvestigations.
He went off the grid two years ago.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.764
(Sydney) These people killed my fiance.

00:39.072 --> 00:43.270
- We lost our only lead on Gordon Dean.
- We'll get another lead.

00:45.745 --> 00:47.736
Yeah.

02:10.663 --> 02:13.632
I'm patched in.
Go for the hack.

(phone rings)

03:32.812 --> 03:36.441
(man) Thank you for calling.
For training. this call may be monitored.

03:36.516 --> 03:38.541
My name is Roger. How may I help you?

03:38.618 --> 03:40.950
Hi... Roger.

03:41.020 --> 03:47.516
- I'd like to cancel a subscription, please.
- Certainly. Can I have the name. please?

03:47.594 --> 03:49.619
Michael Vaughn.

03:49.696 --> 03:52.756
- V-a-u-g-h-n.
- Got it.

03:52.832 --> 03:58.327
I see it right here. May I ask why
you're canceling the subscription?

03:59.906 --> 04:01.897
Mr. Vaughn died.

04:03.042 --> 04:06.705
- I'm sorry. I'll take care of it right away.
- Yeah.

04:14.320 --> 04:15.947
OK.

04:46.686 --> 04:50.349
(Marshall) If your wife says it's a waste
of time having a pen pal, she's wrong.

04:50.423 --> 04:54.223
'Cause two days ago there was
a theft at an R&D facility in lstanbul.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.592
The Turks did a good job
keeping it under wraps,

04:56.663 --> 05:00.224
but my friend Ali forwarded me this.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.736
Take a look right there.
You see those vials?

05:03.803 --> 05:05.896
That's a nerve agent called substance 33,

05:05.972 --> 05:08.167
developed by the Russians
during the Cold War.

05:08.241 --> 05:13.907
Remarkable stuff. You know,
in an end-of-civilization sort of way.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.777
Why do you think they worked for Dean?

05:15.848 --> 05:18.510
They don't. As far as we can tell,
they're independent.

05:18.584 --> 05:22.247
- Gordon Dean, he's...
- Former ClA. Disappeared two years ago.

05:22.322 --> 05:26.383
Infiltrated this office,
compromised one of your men.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.592
- I'm up to speed, thanks.
- Sorry, l...

05:30.663 --> 05:33.791
New guy. I just assumed that maybe...

05:35.435 --> 05:36.424
(clears throat)

05:36.502 --> 05:41.599
Anyway, this woman right here,
that's who I think works for Dean.

05:41.674 --> 05:44.302
You think? Based on what, your pen pal?

05:44.377 --> 05:48.541
Who, Ali? No, see, this woman had help.

05:48.614 --> 05:50.673
A hacker who accessed
the security system

05:50.750 --> 05:54.015
using the same computer
as a hack on the NSA a few months back,

05:54.087 --> 05:55.714
which we know was ordered by Dean,

05:55.788 --> 05:59.485
so two hours ago I traced this computer

05:59.559 --> 06:02.892
to Prague, within these five square miles.

06:02.962 --> 06:05.692
But if I can go to Prague,
I can narrow it down to two feet,

06:05.765 --> 06:09.326
then we can grab this hacker and get
him to tell us where the substance 33 is.

06:09.402 --> 06:11.131
But if we do that, we lose Dean,

06:11.204 --> 06:14.537
and once he realizes his hacker is missing,
he'll disappear as well.

06:14.607 --> 06:15.699
Right.

06:15.775 --> 06:18.801
OK, I want you both to accompany
Marshall to Prague.

06:18.878 --> 06:21.369
Follow the signal,
locate Dean's operation there,

06:21.447 --> 06:24.382
but don't do anything to reveal yourself
or to engage his men.

06:24.450 --> 06:26.816
Then we'll reassess our options.

06:26.886 --> 06:29.184
Shouldn't Dixon be going with me?

06:29.255 --> 06:31.917
I've tasked Dixon to another assignment.

06:31.991 --> 06:38.260
Marshall will brief you on your OPTEC.
Let me know when you're ready to leave.

06:42.568 --> 06:45.298
Dad. You're making a mistake.

06:45.371 --> 06:49.102
I understand you're more comfortable
with Dixon, but that was inappropriate.

06:49.175 --> 06:53.271
- This is no time to break in a new agent.
- Grace has extensive field experience.

06:53.346 --> 06:55.837
And I have a history with Dixon.

06:55.915 --> 07:00.079
What is so important that
he can't come with me on this mission?

07:00.153 --> 07:02.246
Your sister.

07:04.657 --> 07:06.682
What about my sister?

07:06.759 --> 07:12.095
You know that Sloane has been
searching for a cure for Nadia.

07:12.165 --> 07:14.633
He may have found one.

07:16.769 --> 07:20.227
