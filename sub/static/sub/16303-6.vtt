* Late in the evening *

00:16.317 --> 00:18.852
* Oh, when the sun goes down *

00:18.852 --> 00:21.222

00:27.728 --> 00:29.630
* Late in the evening *

00:29.630 --> 00:32.100
* I wanna be with you *

00:32.700 --> 00:35.736
* Baby baby baby,
I'm in love with you *

00:35.736 --> 00:37.205
* And that's so true *

00:37.205 --> 00:38.839
* My heart is running wild *

00:38.839 --> 00:40.574
* That's not the wind *

00:40.574 --> 00:43.844

to ease my soul *

00:54.122 --> 00:54.855
- Where were we?

00:54.855 --> 00:56.390
- You said we're fucked.

00:56.390 --> 01:01.595
- No, I believe he said the we
are (high pitched) fuuuuucked.

01:01.595 --> 01:03.364
- Aw, that's not what
I sound like.

01:03.364 --> 01:04.732
- Yeah, that's what you
sound like.

01:04.732 --> 01:05.833
- Ew.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.835
Well, why don't you
do the honors?

01:07.835 --> 01:09.237
You tell us where
we're gonna start.

01:09.237 --> 01:10.704
- Uh...

01:10.704 --> 01:12.240
I never got my molars removed,
so if you're offering some

01:12.240 --> 01:12.906
free dental work...

01:12.906 --> 01:14.342
- [laughter]

Hobbs.

01:15.709 --> 01:17.077
Mullins.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.213
You told me this guy was funny,
but I had no idea.

01:19.213 --> 01:20.214
- They said I was funny?

01:20.214 --> 01:21.149
- Yeah!

01:21.149 --> 01:21.715
[laughing]

01:21.715 --> 01:23.784
Seriously.

01:23.784 --> 01:25.919
Tell them what they
want to know.

01:25.919 --> 01:29.157
It'll take away my fun, but
it'll be a lot easier on you.

01:30.891 --> 01:31.759
No?

01:31.759 --> 01:32.860
Are they always this quiet?

01:32.860 --> 01:34.895
- Usually they won't
shut the hell up.

01:34.895 --> 01:36.930
- You are aware of our timeline?

01:36.930 --> 01:38.299
- Right.

01:38.299 --> 01:40.168
Timeline.

01:41.302 --> 01:42.336
Alright.

01:43.171 --> 01:44.272
Timeline.

01:44.905 --> 01:45.773
Timeline.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.375
Everybody's in such a rush.

01:47.375 --> 01:49.810
Everybody else's time is so...

01:49.810 --> 01:50.878
damn important.

01:50.878 --> 01:54.415
Alright, then let's
just jump...

01:55.649 --> 01:58.186
Straight to the main course.

01:58.186 --> 01:58.719
- A toothpick?

01:58.719 --> 01:59.320
Really?

01:59.320 --> 02:01.422
- Hey, Sam.

02:01.422 --> 02:03.357
Those are really nice nail beds.

02:03.357 --> 02:04.592
Yeah.

02:04.592 --> 02:06.894
Let me take a closer look
at those, would ya?

02:07.361 --> 02:08.762
- What are you doing?

02:08.762 --> 02:10.164
What are you doing?

02:13.401 --> 02:16.304
- Do you guys like spicy food?

02:16.304 --> 02:17.070
I do.

02:17.070 --> 02:18.372
I can't get enough of it.

02:18.372 --> 02:20.441
I'm always trying to find
the hottest dish I can.

02:20.441 --> 02:23.244
I'm like a masochist
for that shit.

02:23.244 --> 02:26.214
And there was this one time
I was working a gig in '09,

02:26.214 --> 02:28.749
where I was working over
a CIA defector.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.284
Guy was a total wuss.

02:30.284 --> 02:32.686
I'm sure you guys will be way
tougher, don't worry about it.

02:32.686 --> 02:35.723
Anyway, on that job, I found
this thing called Moruga.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.225
Moruga.

02:37.225 --> 02:38.426
You ever heard of it?

02:38.426 --> 02:40.794
- I got it from a Cajun guy
in Seattle.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.263
Like that even makes sense.

02:42.263 --> 02:43.831
It's a rare pepper.

02:43.831 --> 02:46.334
It's twice as hot as the
ghost pepper.

02:46.334 --> 02:49.270
- SAM: [pained grunts]

02:49.270 --> 02:51.004
- Yeah, see, that's the Moruga.

02:51.004 --> 02:54.475
All I had to do was put a
tiny little drop under

02:54.475 --> 02:57.211
his little finger nail.

03:00.948 --> 03:03.251
- SAM: [pained yelling]

03:03.251 --> 03:04.151
- So.

03:04.151 --> 03:06.254
Here's how this is gonna work.

03:06.254 --> 03:08.856
You're gonna tell them
what they want to know.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.057
Or.

03:10.057 --> 03:12.360
You're all gonna get
to taste the Moruga.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.795
- SAM: [pained yelling]

03:14.795 --> 03:17.465
- How does that sound?

03:17.465 --> 03:27.007
- [instrumental music]

03:37.418 --> 03:47.428

04:15.356 --> 04:16.557
- SAM: Please, make it stop!

04:16.557 --> 04:18.359
- MULLINS: Tell us how you
created the rift.

04:18.359 --> 04:19.527
- SAM: I don't know!

04:19.527 --> 04:20.494
I don't know.

04:20.494 --> 04:21.094
- You know.

04:21.094 --> 04:21.762
Tell us how!

04:21.762 --> 04:23.063
- I don't know!

04:23.063 --> 04:24.832
- Tell us how you did it!

04:24.832 --> 04:25.899
- Sam.

04:25.899 --> 04:27.868
Sam, I do not want
to do this again.

04:27.868 --> 04:28.936
- No, please!

04:28.936 --> 04:29.970
- It's expensive.

04:29.970 --> 04:30.704
- Please NO! No!

04:30.704 --> 04:31.805
- Wait, wait, wait!

04:31.805 --> 04:32.440
I'll tell you.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.073
I'll tell you.

04:33.073 --> 04:34.375
I'll tell you.

04:34.375 --> 04:34.975
- Yeah?

04:34.975 --> 04:36.477
- Yeah.

04:36.477 --> 04:37.878
- I'm all ears.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.380
- Well..

04:39.380 --> 04:40.714
[spits]

04:42.416 --> 04:44.352
- You know...

04:44.352 --> 04:46.454
I find it admirable that
you millennials are

04:46.454 --> 04:47.788
so tough to work over.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.123
I mean, if you wanna talk
about greatest generation,

04:50.123 --> 04:51.559
you guys would have my vote.

04:51.559 --> 04:53.361
Hands down.

04:53.361 --> 04:55.563
But... let me tell you what
your problem is.

04:55.563 --> 04:58.999
You are currently locked up in
the most elusive government

04:58.999 --> 05:00.468
facility in the world.

05:00.468 --> 05:02.403
- [Mullins clears her throat]

05:02.403 --> 05:03.036
- Yeah.

05:03.036 --> 05:04.438
Okay, Mullins.

05:04.438 --> 05:06.006
We're all super proud of your
top secret circus show

05:06.006 --> 05:07.207
you got here.

05:07.207 --> 05:09.076
But I think these four
deserve to know...

05:09.076 --> 05:12.380
just how badly they
are fucked.

05:15.115 --> 05:16.984
Because honey...

05:19.152 --> 05:21.489
You've been eatin' beans.

05:21.622 --> 05:23.457
And I think it's time...

05:23.457 --> 05:25.426
you spilled 'em.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.429
- No...

05:33.033 --> 05:34.435
- It's not that bad.

05:34.568 --> 05:35.636
- Oh...

05:35.636 --> 05:38.005
Just give it a second.

05:39.507 --> 05:43.043
- [pained screaming]

05:43.043 --> 05:44.144

is happening?

05:46.179 --> 05:47.415
- Connor!

05:47.415 --> 05:49.016
Connor!

05:49.016 --> 05:58.459
- [lightening, electricity
buzzing]

05:58.459 --> 06:00.027
- Guys, what's going on
with Larry?

06:00.027 --> 06:01.161
- It looks like he's
having a seizure!

06:01.161 --> 06:02.262
- Shit.

06:02.262 --> 06:04.097
You need to get the
power back on.

06:04.097 --> 06:05.165
- What? What?

06:05.165 --> 06:07.501
- You need to get
the power back on!

06:07.501 --> 06:08.902
- Why don't I just disconnect
everyone's helmets?

06:08.902 --> 06:09.369
- No!

06:09.369 --> 06:10.103
No!

06:10.103 --> 06:11.405
We're not at full power!

06:11.405 --> 06:14.174
You do that, and it'll
fry our minds together!

06:14.174 --> 06:15.909
You need to flip the breakers.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.077
- SAM: What? Flip the what?

06:17.077 --> 06:17.845
- The breakers!

06:17.845 --> 06:20.113
The fucking breakers!

06:21.949 --> 06:23.016
And get a defibrillator.

06:23.016 --> 06:23.484
- A defibrillator?

06:23.484 --> 06:24.384
Why?

06:24.384 --> 06:27.387
- In case Larry's heart stops!

06:27.555 --> 06:28.956
- Fuck, Sam. Fuck!

06:28.956 --> 06:30.491
- You shouldn't have made the
move on my girlfriend!

06:30.491 --> 06:32.460
- She's not your girlfriend!

06:32.460 --> 06:33.326
Just flip the breaker.

06:33.326 --> 06:34.562
I'll get the defibrillator.

06:34.562 --> 06:35.529
- Fine.

06:35.529 --> 06:41.168
- [music stutters]

06:41.168 --> 06:43.003

stop partying!

06:43.003 --> 06:44.171
- Hey, man!

06:44.171 --> 06:45.473
Why are you trying to
kill the party?

06:45.473 --> 06:48.175
- If you don't stop, this
party's gonna kill you!

06:48.175 --> 06:49.510
- Killer party bro!

06:49.510 --> 06:51.144
- [cheering]

06:51.144 --> 06:53.113

- Yeah!

06:55.082 --> 06:55.849
- No!

Casper, turn it down!

06:56.349 --> 06:58.586
Down!

06:58.586 --> 06:59.720

06:59.720 --> 07:00.353
Connor, what the hell
is happening?

07:00.353 --> 07:02.155
- It's Larry.

07:22.242 --> 07:22.943
- Yeah, I'm a...

07:22.943 --> 07:24.044
adjunct professor.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.012
- For what?

07:25.012 --> 07:26.580
- Assholes.

07:26.580 --> 07:27.180
- What was that?

07:27.180 --> 07:27.915
- Assholes.

07:27.915 --> 07:29.116
I teach proctology.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.585
So could you give me
some fucking space here?

07:38.526 --> 07:40.293
[choking and spitting]

07:40.293 --> 07:41.662
- I don't think he can breath!

07:41.662 --> 07:42.763
- He's clutching his left arm!

07:42.763 --> 07:43.997
Everyone, we learned
this in class.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.666
These are classic signs
of a heart attack.

07:45.666 --> 07:46.567
What do you do?

07:46.567 --> 07:47.801
- I don't know!

07:47.801 --> 07:49.870
- I just want to be an
interior decorator!

07:50.170 --> 07:51.639
- Someone get me the
crash cart!

- [music]

07:57.611 --> 07:59.580
- You're great.

07:59.580 --> 08:00.748
That was a test, everybody.

08:00.748 --> 08:01.882
You passed.

08:01.882 --> 08:02.616
You should be very proud
of your studies

08:02.616 --> 08:03.483
and your hard work.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.553
You're all gonna be heroes!

Stop eating those orbs!

08:26.740 --> 08:29.242
- Victoria?

08:29.242 --> 08:30.711
We had something.

- Yeah, we did.

08:31.645 --> 08:32.680
But...

08:32.680 --> 08:33.446

09:09.149 --> 09:10.818
- Have fun with the dogs, Larry.

09:10.818 --> 09:12.185
'Cause that's what you are!

09:12.185 --> 09:15.255
A big, stupid dog.

Loser Larry.

King Daddy Berkman's watch,

09:48.388 --> 09:49.690
ya little bitch!

09:49.857 --> 09:51.591
Clear!

09:52.392 --> 09:53.627
- Wow.

09:53.627 --> 09:56.429
You are really holding it
together, miss lady.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.866
A lot better than
your buddy, Sam, is.

09:59.399 --> 10:00.701
Alright.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.169
What do you say we take
this up a notch, huh?

10:02.169 --> 10:03.303
Let's get those shoes off.

10:03.303 --> 10:04.672
Hobbs?

10:04.672 --> 10:05.338
- BERKMAN: Wait!

10:05.338 --> 10:07.440
Wait, wait, wait.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.276
- I'll tell you about the
black hole.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.778
- Berkman, what are you
talking about?

10:10.778 --> 10:11.779
- Yeah?

10:11.779 --> 10:12.445
- Yeah.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.214
Just come here.

10:14.214 --> 10:20.453
- [whispering]

10:20.453 --> 10:21.722
- Okay.

10:22.823 --> 10:24.057
- What did he say?

10:25.192 --> 10:27.260
- Well, he said that my
mother's vagina

10:27.260 --> 10:28.428
is the black hole.

10:28.428 --> 10:29.596
- Right.

10:29.596 --> 10:30.964
- And then also something
about a goatse.

10:30.964 --> 10:31.732
Does either of you know
what the fuck a goatse is?

10:31.732 --> 10:34.001
- Google it, asshole!

10:34.001 --> 10:35.368
- Berkman, stop
fucking around!

10:35.368 --> 10:37.370
- Agent Hobbs?

10:37.370 --> 10:39.206
Please remove the
subject's pants.

10:39.206 --> 10:40.207
- My pleasure.

10:40.207 --> 10:41.174
- Who's the subject?

10:41.174 --> 10:41.775
Am I the subject?

10:41.775 --> 10:42.509
I'm the subject?

10:42.509 --> 10:43.744
What are you doing?

10:43.744 --> 10:45.478
Cut it out!

10:45.478 --> 10:46.379
This is gonna change you!

10:46.379 --> 10:47.214
- Hold still.

10:47.214 --> 10:47.948
- Hey!

10:47.948 --> 10:48.716
You can't come back!

10:48.716 --> 10:49.449
Why are you smiling?!

10:49.449 --> 10:53.420
- [pained screaming]

10:54.387 --> 10:55.488
- No, no, no!

10:55.488 --> 10:56.389
Damn it, Larry!

10:56.389 --> 10:58.759
Wake up, you bizarre bastard!

10:58.759 --> 10:59.392
Clear!

10:59.392 --> 11:01.729
- [chaotic music]

11:01.729 --> 11:02.763

11:02.763 --> 11:04.932
Clear!

11:04.932 --> 11:06.366
- Fuck you, Larry!

11:06.366 --> 11:07.868
- [zap]

11:09.402 --> 11:11.772
- Don't you die on me!

11:11.772 --> 11:16.509
Okay, I know I treat you like
shit, and I call you bad names.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.246
And I said that you're
worthless, but you're not.

11:19.246 --> 11:20.280
Okay?

11:20.280 --> 11:21.782
You're better than me.

11:21.782 --> 11:23.016
So just...

11:23.016 --> 11:25.285
if you're in there,
and you can hear me...

11:25.285 --> 11:26.954
just please, Larry.

11:26.954 --> 11:29.122
Just come back for me, okay?

11:29.489 --> 11:30.257
- [zap]

11:30.257 --> 11:32.960
- [music starting up]

11:32.960 --> 11:37.765
[pulsing beeps]

11:37.765 --> 11:38.498
- Yeah!

11:38.498 --> 11:40.801
Yes, Larry!

11:42.269 --> 11:43.804
- What the fuck was that?

11:43.804 --> 11:45.839
- Sam, Berkman, is anyone
out there?

11:45.839 --> 11:46.473
- Connor!

11:46.473 --> 11:46.974
You guys alright?

11:46.974 --> 11:47.841
- Barely!

11:47.841 --> 11:49.276
What the hell is going on?!

11:49.276 --> 11:52.412
- Well, what's going on is
that Larry keeps dying on me

11:52.412 --> 11:54.514
and I keep having to be a
total hero and save the day.

11:54.514 --> 11:57.851
- So if you see him, can you
tell him that he owes me?

11:57.851 --> 11:59.820
He owes me big time!

11:59.820 --> 12:03.290
- [flatline tone]

12:03.290 --> 12:04.958
- Ah, he's dead again.

12:07.027 --> 12:11.932
- [electric buzzing]

12:11.932 --> 12:12.599
[zap]

12:12.599 --> 12:13.466
- Got him back.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.035
- How's the power situation?

12:15.035 --> 12:15.769
- I don't know!

12:15.769 --> 12:17.470
Sam's working on it!

12:23.911 --> 12:24.544
- Sorry!

12:24.544 --> 12:25.745
Sorry, sorry!

12:25.979 --> 12:27.514
- Dean Samuelson!

12:27.647 --> 12:29.582
- Co...caine.

12:29.582 --> 12:30.683
- Sam!

12:30.683 --> 12:32.886
What, uh, what are
you doing here?

12:32.886 --> 12:33.921
What's up?

12:33.921 --> 12:35.455
- Well...

12:35.455 --> 12:37.590
I was hoping that you could
help with those power breakers.

12:37.590 --> 12:38.892
We had a glitch
in the lab.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.327
- Yes! Yes!

12:40.327 --> 12:40.994
Yes!

12:40.994 --> 12:42.029
I can help you.

12:42.029 --> 12:42.662
I can help with
the breakers.

12:42.662 --> 12:43.396
I can do that.

12:43.396 --> 12:44.898
I'm helping people.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.299
[snorts]

12:46.299 --> 12:47.901
[clearing throat]

12:47.901 --> 12:49.870
- You wanna do a bump?

12:49.870 --> 12:51.038
- A cocaine bump?

12:51.038 --> 12:51.972
- When in Rome.

12:51.972 --> 12:52.906
Let's go to Rome.

12:52.906 --> 12:54.041
- I shouldn't.

12:54.041 --> 12:55.308
- Do a little bumpski
with the Dean.

12:55.308 --> 12:55.943
- Oh, no, no, no.

12:55.943 --> 12:56.676
I don't think so.

12:56.676 --> 12:58.145
- Yeah, I think so.

12:58.946 --> 13:04.351
- [dramatic music]

13:04.351 --> 13:05.552
- What's going on?

13:05.552 --> 13:08.355
- We need everybody to form
a straight line!

13:08.355 --> 13:11.358
Please begin exiting in an
orderly fashion!

13:11.358 --> 13:12.960
- Not you, Casper Van Dien!

13:12.960 --> 13:13.927
You're not real!

13:13.927 --> 13:15.328
- Very cool!

13:15.328 --> 13:20.367
- [buzzing]

13:20.367 --> 13:21.634
[zap]

13:21.634 --> 13:23.871
- Stop dying, Larry!

13:23.871 --> 13:25.105
- What the hell is going on?!

13:25.105 --> 13:26.206
- Connor!

13:26.206 --> 13:27.407
You gotta get the people
out right now.

13:27.407 --> 13:28.008
Because I don't know how
much juice I've got left

13:28.008 --> 13:30.510
in these things.

13:30.510 --> 13:31.378
- You've got to get the
fucking power back on!

13:31.378 --> 13:32.880
- Oh, get the power back on.

13:32.880 --> 13:35.148
That's Sam's job!

13:36.483 --> 13:37.084
- Aha!

13:37.084 --> 13:37.684
Here we go.

13:37.684 --> 13:38.285
Breaker box.

13:38.285 --> 13:39.052
Right here.

13:39.052 --> 13:40.287
Now, here's the deal.

13:40.287 --> 13:42.856
I talked to the guy, and
all we really need to do,

13:42.856 --> 13:45.125
is we need to flip the switch,
then we wait 15 seconds.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.894
I wanna say he said 15 seconds.

13:46.894 --> 13:47.760
Might have said 50.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.362
Then we just switch it back.

13:49.362 --> 13:50.130
Alright?

13:50.130 --> 13:50.730
- Great, great, great!

13:50.730 --> 13:51.598
Let's do it!

13:51.598 --> 13:52.966
- Hey, Sam.
- Yeah?

13:52.966 --> 13:54.667
- You have to promise me you
won't talk to your dad

13:54.667 --> 13:55.568
about any of my...

13:55.568 --> 13:57.971
you know, criminal background.

13:57.971 --> 13:59.172
- Criminal?

13:59.172 --> 13:59.739
I thought you were just
stealing money?

13:59.739 --> 14:00.207
- Exactly.

14:00.207 --> 14:01.074
Exactly!

14:01.074 --> 14:03.443
Just financial impropriety!

14:03.443 --> 14:04.444
I don't have anything to hide!

14:04.444 --> 14:05.178
- Okay!

14:05.178 --> 14:06.346
- Okay. Here we go.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.480
- We need to get out of here
right now.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.482
- We can't just leave
everyone here.

14:09.482 --> 14:10.417
- Now!

14:10.417 --> 14:11.418
- Come on!

14:11.418 --> 14:12.152
- We need to count!

14:12.152 --> 14:13.954
One.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.588
Two.

14:15.588 --> 14:16.990
Three.

14:16.990 --> 14:17.925
You can help.

14:17.925 --> 14:19.092
Four.

14:23.030 --> 14:24.131
- Oh, typical Larry.

14:24.131 --> 14:27.567
- [chaotic music]

14:27.567 --> 14:29.069
- Eight.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.437
Nine.

14:30.437 --> 14:30.904
You can feel the tension.

14:30.904 --> 14:32.572
Yes!

14:33.506 --> 14:37.044
- [patty music halts]

14:37.044 --> 14:38.511
- Twelve!

14:38.511 --> 14:41.949

14:41.949 --> 14:43.183

14:43.183 --> 14:44.417
- Fifteen one thousand!

14:44.417 --> 14:45.552
Okay!

14:45.552 --> 14:46.419
- Oh my God, you know,
in retrospect,

14:46.419 --> 14:47.187
I think he said 30 seconds.

14:47.187 --> 14:48.255
Let's wait 30 seconds.

14:48.255 --> 14:50.157
I think that's what we
should do.

14:50.157 --> 14:51.324
- Oh, Jesus.

14:53.026 --> 14:54.261
- Sixteen.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.197
- Seventeen.

14:58.966 --> 14:59.933
- Eighteen.

15:02.069 --> 15:03.236

15:41.541 --> 15:42.976

15:44.077 --> 15:45.245
Hold on, that's the switch
to room 209.

15:45.245 --> 15:46.646
That's my office.

15:46.646 --> 15:47.647
I am so high.

15:47.647 --> 15:48.415
I apologize.

15:48.415 --> 15:49.649
I'm really high as a bug.

15:49.649 --> 15:50.950
- It's your office?!

15:52.252 --> 15:53.486
- Get out of here!

15:53.486 --> 15:54.221
Okay.

On, on, on, on, on.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.392
The pain just kind of
comes in waves, doesn't it?

16:33.160 --> 16:35.162
How you doing, Mr. Berkman?

16:36.096 --> 16:37.830
- Feels like the...

16:37.830 --> 16:39.799
time I got the clap
from your mom.

16:39.799 --> 16:42.302
- [laughing]

16:42.302 --> 16:43.170
- Well, you know,
coincidentally,

16:43.170 --> 16:45.238
she was a prostitute, but...

16:45.238 --> 16:47.174
I think I turned out okay.

16:47.174 --> 16:48.708
- [footsteps]

Torture's not my thing.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.113
Tell us what you know.

16:53.113 --> 16:54.547

16:54.547 --> 16:55.848
- Tell me, Connor.

16:55.848 --> 16:56.983
Where did the hole come from?

16:56.983 --> 16:59.652
- Connor, do you know
something or not?

16:59.652 --> 17:00.587
- Was it the Brain Frame?

17:00.587 --> 17:01.721
- No.

17:01.721 --> 17:02.589
- Did you come in
contact with dark matter?

17:02.589 --> 17:04.157
Aliens or celestial beings?

17:04.157 --> 17:05.058
- Aliens?!

17:05.058 --> 17:07.427
Who the fuck are you people?!

17:08.661 --> 17:11.731
- I have nothing to say.

17:16.303 --> 17:17.837
- What happened, Connor?

17:17.837 --> 17:19.306
- Fuck you.

- [inhales sharply]

17:24.177 --> 17:26.879
- [coughs]

17:26.879 --> 17:28.781
- What happened, Connor?

17:29.816 --> 17:30.917
- I wouldn't even know
where to begin.

17:30.917 --> 17:32.585
- Well, why isn't anybody
else waking up?!

17:32.585 --> 17:34.221
- Connor.

17:34.221 --> 17:35.655
What was that thing?

17:35.655 --> 17:36.723
- What thing?

17:36.723 --> 17:39.592
- It had red eyes
and it was just...

17:39.592 --> 17:42.262
vaporizing people.

17:42.262 --> 17:43.196
- No!

17:43.196 --> 17:44.697
It was...

17:44.697 --> 17:47.167
it was just something else.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.768
It was like...

17:48.768 --> 17:50.670
it was real.

17:50.670 --> 17:51.904
- It all feels real in there.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.740
- No, it was...

17:55.142 --> 17:57.810
- Khaibit.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.212
- What?

17:59.212 --> 17:59.946
- Khaibit.

17:59.946 --> 18:01.248
The Shadow Man.

18:01.248 --> 18:03.750
All nightmare mythology
has a version of him.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.918
From Carl Jung to the
ancient Egyptians.

18:05.918 --> 18:06.653
- Yeah, yeah.

18:06.653 --> 18:07.420
The Egyptian shadow man.

18:07.420 --> 18:08.521
Did you hear that, Larry?

18:08.521 --> 18:09.622
We're gonna get you
out of there.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.591
It's just the Egyptian
shadow man.

18:11.591 --> 18:12.192
He's a real nice guy.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.092
Cool? [slap]

18:13.092 --> 18:14.026
- What are you talking about?

18:14.026 --> 18:16.129
- Just give me a second,
Berkman!

18:20.167 --> 18:21.634
- Is he...

18:21.634 --> 18:23.270
dead?

18:23.270 --> 18:24.271
- No, none of them are dead.

18:24.271 --> 18:26.373
- It's like a coma?

18:26.373 --> 18:28.208
- Yeah, you could say that.

18:31.178 --> 18:33.246
- Well, this party
fucking sucked.

18:33.246 --> 18:34.681
- How do we get them back?

18:34.681 --> 18:35.882
- How do we bring who back?

18:35.882 --> 18:36.549
Oh!

18:36.549 --> 18:38.385
The power's on!

18:38.385 --> 18:39.386
I did that!

18:39.386 --> 18:42.189
I did that, you guys!

18:42.189 --> 18:43.256
Hey guys.

18:43.256 --> 18:44.191
How's it going?

18:44.191 --> 18:45.292
- Is that cocaine on your nose?

18:45.292 --> 18:46.226
- Oh!

18:46.226 --> 18:47.360
Sorry.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.361
Anyway, long story.

18:48.361 --> 18:49.696
Actually, kind of
a short story.

18:49.696 --> 18:50.597
Dean Samuelson.

18:50.597 --> 18:51.831
Huge coke head, it turns out.

18:51.831 --> 18:52.599
He gave me a little bit
of coke; I did it.

18:52.599 --> 18:54.401
I highly recommend it.

18:54.401 --> 18:56.269
- Mother fucker!

18:56.269 --> 18:56.969
Look at them!

18:56.969 --> 18:58.205
Look at them, Sam!

18:58.205 --> 18:59.472
You did this!

18:59.472 --> 19:01.308
You blackmailed me into
using that machine!

19:01.308 --> 19:02.275
This is your fault!

19:02.275 --> 19:03.210
Your fault!

19:03.210 --> 19:03.843
- I'm sorry, okay?

19:03.843 --> 19:05.445
I didn't mean to-

19:06.213 --> 19:06.979
- Tell us now!

19:06.979 --> 19:07.747
- I'm sorry, Connor.

19:07.747 --> 19:08.948
This is all my fault.

19:08.948 --> 19:09.516
- No.

19:09.516 --> 19:11.418
It's mine.

19:11.418 --> 19:13.320
I let this go too far.

19:13.320 --> 19:14.387
You ruined my work!

19:14.387 --> 19:17.357
You ruined my work!

19:17.357 --> 19:19.926
- I was only using you for
your father's money.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.328
- I never liked you.

19:21.328 --> 19:23.230
Nobody likes you.

19:23.230 --> 19:25.198
- [smack]

19:31.771 --> 19:33.373
- I got the power back on.

19:37.344 --> 19:39.979
- [heavy breathing]

19:39.979 --> 19:42.915
And worst of all...

19:42.915 --> 19:45.485
I put the science second,
and the money first.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.355
- Damn it!

19:52.492 --> 19:56.329
- [short sobbing breaths]

19:56.329 --> 19:59.198
Larry...

20:00.767 --> 20:03.202
You were...

20:03.903 --> 20:05.605
You were a good assistant.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.442
You deserve better
than this.

20:09.442 --> 20:12.445
- [solemn music]

20:12.445 --> 20:14.281
- I'm so sorry.

20:14.281 --> 20:18.050
- [solemn music]

20:18.050 --> 20:20.320
- I'll take good care
of Mr. Peanuts.

20:21.354 --> 20:23.222
I promise.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.528
- And that night...

20:28.528 --> 20:31.331
after you left the lab...

20:31.331 --> 20:35.502
I swore I would never,
ever be that reckless again.

20:36.536 --> 20:39.005
And that I would
do anything...

20:39.005 --> 20:42.008
I could to get Larry back.

20:42.008 --> 20:44.076
- What did you do
after I left?

20:44.076 --> 20:45.077
- It's complicated.

20:45.077 --> 20:48.448
- What did you do?!

20:48.448 --> 20:50.983
- I'm sorry I was such a
terrible friend.

20:50.983 --> 21:02.929
- [dramatic music]

21:02.929 --> 21:05.365
- [phone dialing]

21:11.103 --> 21:19.111
- (speaking Japanese)

21:19.111 --> 21:27.554
- (speaking Japanese)

21:29.522 --> 21:32.459
- [ping]

21:32.459 --> 21:34.994
- Yes?

21:34.994 --> 21:36.563
- This better be good.

21:36.996 --> 21:39.065
- Your son.

21:39.065 --> 21:41.000
I've been following him.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.403
- Anything that can threaten
my nomination?

21:43.403 --> 21:44.270
- You need to get down here.

21:44.270 --> 21:46.072
- What's Samuel involved in?

21:46.072 --> 21:48.007
- It's not Sam.

21:48.007 --> 21:50.477
It's his friends.

21:52.044 --> 21:53.480
- Okay.

21:55.582 --> 21:56.983
- Mr. Nagahuoro.

21:56.983 --> 22:00.152
My people will send your people
wiring instructions.

22:00.152 --> 22:03.122
Oh, and tell your wife I'll
be late for dinner tomorrow.

22:03.122 --> 22:04.391
I have another pressing
engagement that needs

22:04.391 --> 22:06.058
my attending.

22:06.426 --> 22:08.060
Arigato.

22:10.397 --> 22:11.163
- Mullins!

22:11.163 --> 22:11.798
The science building!

22:11.798 --> 22:13.065
It's coming down.

22:13.065 --> 22:15.034
It's all over the news,
Twitter, everywhere.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.202
- Fuck!

22:19.138 --> 22:21.173
- You guys have any idea
what you've done?

22:21.173 --> 22:22.642
Do you even think about the
fucking shit storm

22:22.642 --> 22:24.677
that you're causing out there?

22:25.478 --> 22:26.513
- Mullins?

22:26.513 --> 22:28.481
What do you want to do?

22:33.420 --> 22:37.757
- [footsteps]

22:41.160 --> 22:42.028
- Kill the girl.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.062
- Okay.

22:43.062 --> 22:43.930
- They're bluffing.

22:43.930 --> 22:45.297
- You know, I gotta tell ya.

22:45.297 --> 22:48.501
This is my second least
favorite part of this job.

22:48.501 --> 22:50.202
My least favorite part
is all the paperwork.

22:50.202 --> 22:50.937
It just never ends.

22:50.937 --> 22:51.671
- Wait, wait, wait!

22:51.671 --> 22:53.072
This is crazy! Okay?

22:53.072 --> 22:55.074
Connor, if you know something,
you fucking tell them!

22:55.074 --> 22:56.509
It's not worth it!

22:57.009 --> 22:57.944
- Okay!

22:57.944 --> 22:58.911
I'll tell you.

22:58.911 --> 22:59.779
- Berkman!

22:59.779 --> 23:01.481
- We can't stall any longer.

23:01.481 --> 23:02.114
- What?

23:02.114 --> 23:03.215
Stall?

23:03.215 --> 23:05.485
- Some...

23:05.485 --> 23:08.521
stuff went down after
you left the lab.

23:10.990 --> 23:12.492
- What kind of stuff?

23:16.195 --> 23:17.296
- Okay.

23:17.296 --> 23:20.199
The U-Haul should
be ready in an hour.

23:20.199 --> 23:23.836
Let's wait 'til dark and
then start loading them in.

23:24.637 --> 23:26.639
- And we're sure this
is the best idea?

23:26.639 --> 23:28.675
- Yes.

23:28.675 --> 23:30.577
We have to get them out
of here to at least

23:30.577 --> 23:32.078
buy us some time.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.145
- [door opening]

23:33.145 --> 23:34.481
- This is a private
sleep study!

23:38.050 --> 23:39.486
Dr. Wittington?

23:39.486 --> 23:41.588
- Where's my son?

23:41.588 --> 23:44.524
- We haven't seen him since
last night.

23:44.724 --> 23:46.258
- We had a...

23:46.258 --> 23:48.595
bit of a falling out.

23:48.595 --> 23:49.796
- Uh, Mr. Wittington,
I'm Berkman.

23:49.796 --> 23:51.598
I just want to say,
this is not what it-

23:51.598 --> 23:54.266
- It's doctor, fuck face.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.569
- [glass tinks]

23:56.569 --> 23:58.237
- He knows Krav Maga.

23:58.237 --> 23:59.706
- He hasn't been here in a day?

23:59.706 --> 24:00.640
- Yes, sir.

24:00.640 --> 24:01.508
- Good.

24:01.508 --> 24:04.076
Make sure he doesn't return.

24:04.076 --> 24:05.645
We've got a lot of
work to do here.

24:06.713 --> 24:08.581
- What are you trying
to tell us?

24:08.715 --> 24:10.249
- Seems pretty clear to me.

24:10.249 --> 24:13.586
Crystal fucking clear!

24:13.586 --> 24:14.587
- You think this is
a fucking game?

24:14.587 --> 24:15.688
Huh, you son of a bitch?

24:15.688 --> 24:16.656
Maybe I'll end your
fucking life.

24:16.656 --> 24:18.290
Do all of us a -
god damned favor.

24:18.290 --> 24:19.492
How about that, huh?

24:19.492 --> 24:22.595
- You keep thinking the rift
was an accident.

24:22.595 --> 24:27.534
But when the science is right,
there are no accidents.

24:27.534 --> 24:29.135
- Gun down.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.537
Say it, Connor.

24:30.537 --> 24:31.671
In plain-spoken English.

24:31.671 --> 24:33.172
- We did it.

24:33.172 --> 24:35.074
We made it.

24:35.074 --> 24:36.576
We created the rift
on purpose.

24:36.576 --> 24:38.244
- Why in the hell
would you do that?

24:38.244 --> 24:42.014
- So you guys would just
walk us right in here.

24:42.014 --> 24:44.016
- We know what this place is.

24:44.016 --> 24:45.317
- And you wanted
to get caught.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.186
- It was the only way in.

24:47.186 --> 24:48.655
- In for what?

24:52.725 --> 24:54.594
- [gunshots]

24:54.594 --> 25:00.499
- [grunting]

25:04.303 --> 25:06.172
- Dad?

25:06.338 --> 25:07.707
What are you doing here?

25:07.707 --> 25:09.676
- Cleaning up your fucking mess.

25:09.676 --> 25:10.476
- Yeah, about time.

25:10.476 --> 25:12.679
- Took you long enough.

25:15.081 --> 25:16.683
- Oh, and Sam.

25:17.650 --> 25:19.652
Happy birthday.

25:21.220 --> 25:22.755
- Now let's go save Larry.

25:22.755 --> 25:25.324
- [silence]

25:25.324 --> 25:35.702
[instrumental music]

25:35.702 --> 25:45.712

25:45.712 --> 25:55.722

26:25.752 --> 26:35.762

26:35.762 --> 26:45.772

26:45.772 --> 26:55.782

26:55.782 --> 27:05.792

27:05.792 --> 27:15.802

27:15.802 --> 27:21.040
