00:22.090 --> 00:25.625
<i>I hope you
never have to hear this tape</i>

00:25.659 --> 00:29.529
<i>as that means
we've left the farm.</i>

00:29.563 --> 00:38.605
<i>We moved here to this land to keep you
safe and to help your mother get well.</i>

00:38.638 --> 00:40.340
<i>She isn't getting better.</i>

00:41.575 --> 00:43.711
<i>I fear she's getting worse.</i>

01:26.988 --> 01:29.724
Come on,
let's check the traps.

01:30.958 --> 01:32.659
I've got your coat.

01:34.729 --> 01:35.997
Right here.

01:47.607 --> 01:49.744
Shhh.

02:29.116 --> 02:32.887
I'm going to let you find
the first trap, okay, Solomon?

03:27.808 --> 03:29.442
Hold on.

03:29.476 --> 03:30.745
Drop it in.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.552
Go on.

04:24.732 --> 04:25.967
Be careful!

04:26.000 --> 04:28.803
I'm sorry, Mother!
What did I do?

04:30.271 --> 04:31.973
Nothing.

04:33.808 --> 04:35.943
Never mind.

04:35.977 --> 04:37.945
Okay, cut her in half.

04:53.127 --> 04:55.062
Good job, Solomon.

04:55.096 --> 04:57.131
You've learned well.

04:57.164 --> 04:59.734
Okay, now take one.
Mm-hm.

05:11.712 --> 05:12.947
Excellent.

05:21.621 --> 05:23.590
Okay.

05:23.623 --> 05:25.192
Where?

05:27.828 --> 05:29.330
Good, go ahead.

06:11.939 --> 06:14.075
He's not jumping anymore.

06:16.911 --> 06:19.080
How long have you had
him in there?

06:19.113 --> 06:21.115
Mm... Mm?

06:21.148 --> 06:24.051
Oh, Solomon.

06:24.085 --> 06:29.190
Creatures can't survive like that. They need
to be able to breathe and eat and drink.

06:34.261 --> 06:36.130
You know what today is?

06:36.163 --> 06:37.398
What?

06:37.431 --> 06:41.068
It's
your father's birthday.

06:41.102 --> 06:42.303
Oh.

06:43.104 --> 06:45.272
I thought maybe
we could go fishing.

06:45.306 --> 06:48.209
He loved to take you fishing,
remember?

06:48.242 --> 06:51.644
We could bake a cake.
How's that sound?

06:51.678 --> 06:54.281
Really? Okay!

06:54.315 --> 06:55.382
Well, then come on.

08:01.182 --> 08:02.850
What happened?

08:04.919 --> 08:06.887
Nothing. Why?

08:07.321 --> 08:08.956
Where did the animals go?

08:09.957 --> 08:11.859
You're very observant,
aren't you?

08:12.826 --> 08:15.062
I guess they went
to find their own food.

08:15.095 --> 08:17.031
Maybe they thought
we were hunting them.

08:18.365 --> 08:23.237
Or maybe they're as observing as you
are and they went to warn the fish!

08:36.951 --> 08:38.852
Mama...

08:38.885 --> 08:41.355
What happens when we... die?

08:44.225 --> 08:46.427
Why are you thinking
about dying?

08:46.460 --> 08:48.095
I don't know.

08:48.128 --> 08:51.298
Is that just like...
the end?

08:53.300 --> 08:58.339
Oh, no, it's not... It's not really
the end. It's more like a change.

08:58.372 --> 09:01.775
What kind of change?

09:03.177 --> 09:04.878
Well.

09:06.080 --> 09:08.282
You know, when a caterpillar
turns into a butterfly?

09:09.883 --> 09:11.051
It's sort of like that.

09:11.085 --> 09:13.087
Life goes on
but in a different way.

09:15.589 --> 09:20.060
Listen, you don't have to worry
about that right now, okay?

09:20.094 --> 09:22.529
You're young
and you're strong

09:22.563 --> 09:24.798
and you're going to be
around for a long time.

09:35.442 --> 09:38.979
You know, I think we might
have better luck catching fish

09:39.013 --> 09:42.349
if we had real worms instead
of these plastic bobbers.

09:43.317 --> 09:44.351
I'll find some!

09:44.385 --> 09:46.387
Here! Hold this for me.

09:48.889 --> 09:50.858
Don't go too far!

10:31.098 --> 10:32.900
Solomon?

10:42.910 --> 10:44.945
- Solomon!
- Ah...!

10:44.978 --> 10:47.147
Not to go too far!
What are you doing?

10:47.181 --> 10:48.949
I... I was trying to find
big ones.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.919
Here. I'm sorry.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.588
All right, sweetie,
those are big worms

10:54.621 --> 10:56.457
but we are done fishing
for today.

10:56.490 --> 10:58.559
We need to leave now.

11:21.148 --> 11:24.084
- I got one.
- Oh, sweetheart.

11:24.118 --> 11:26.420
Good job. Keep going.

11:31.992 --> 11:33.627
Millie.

11:40.134 --> 11:44.138
How did you get loose again?

11:44.171 --> 11:46.540
Millie needs milking.

11:49.343 --> 11:51.311
I'll be right back.

11:51.979 --> 11:53.647
Come on, Millie.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.351
Shall we sing
"Happy Birthday"?

12:31.385 --> 12:35.289
<i>â™ª Happy Birthday to... â™ª</i>

12:35.322 --> 12:37.191
Do we have to?

12:37.224 --> 12:39.426
No, I just thought
it might be nice.

12:39.460 --> 12:41.028
I don't feel like it.

12:41.061 --> 12:44.031
Okay, well...

12:44.064 --> 12:47.267
maybe you just want to make
a wish and blow out a candle.

12:50.705 --> 12:52.272
It's right in front of you.

13:02.750 --> 13:05.319
Yay, Solomon.

13:07.087 --> 13:09.022
What'd you wish for?

13:09.056 --> 13:10.424
I can't tell you.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.330
Hey! Cut it out!

13:24.171 --> 13:26.173
I love you so much!

13:41.355 --> 13:43.123
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

13:43.156 --> 13:46.360
<i>near a tiny village
beside a tiny bay,</i>

13:46.393 --> 13:50.564
<i>there lived a baby goat
in a tiny woodland, far away.</i>

13:50.597 --> 13:54.702
<i>Mama goat and
Papa goat loved their baby so.</i>

13:54.736 --> 13:57.304
<i>They nurtured him
and kept him safe</i>

13:57.337 --> 13:59.707
<i>and watched him
bloom and grow.</i>

13:59.741 --> 14:01.843
<i>Then Mama would sing a lullaby</i>

14:01.876 --> 14:04.177
<i>to help him fall asleep</i>

14:04.211 --> 14:08.315
<i>while Papa rocked him in his
arms and Baby counted sheep.</i>

14:08.348 --> 14:10.684
<i>On and on, it went this way</i>

14:10.718 --> 14:13.120
<i>as baby goat grew old.</i>

14:13.153 --> 14:15.188
<i>He never wandered
far from home</i>

14:15.222 --> 14:16.858
<i>always doing as he's told.</i>

14:16.891 --> 14:19.293
<i>Until one day</i>

14:19.326 --> 14:23.564
<i>he ventured off
roaming far and wide.</i>

14:23.597 --> 14:28.101
<i>Climbing up and over hills
and down the other side.</i>

14:28.135 --> 14:30.470
<i>Past the stream,
into the woods</i>

14:30.504 --> 14:32.774
<i>where the canopy turns black.</i>

14:32.807 --> 14:35.777
<i>Further,
deeper and darker he went</i>

14:35.810 --> 14:37.745
<i>until it was time to go back.</i>

14:37.779 --> 14:40.748
<i>"But which way to go?"</i>

14:40.782 --> 14:43.785
<i>he wondered aloud,
unsure of how to get home.</i>

14:45.586 --> 14:47.454
<i>"What have I done?
Where have I come?</i>

14:47.487 --> 14:49.656
<i>And just how far
have I roamed?"</i>

14:49.690 --> 14:52.894
<i>Frightened and
crying and turned all around,</i>

14:52.927 --> 14:55.897
<i>that's when he heard it,
a terrible sound.</i>

14:57.331 --> 14:59.266
<i>A trumpet of.</i>

14:59.299 --> 15:01.668
<i>Or is it teeth?</i>

15:01.703 --> 15:06.473
<i>Slouched and crouched
and hungry for meat.</i>

15:06.506 --> 15:09.744
<i>Baby goat ran
with furious speed.</i>

15:09.777 --> 15:12.412
<i>Out of the woods,
over the stream.</i>

15:12.446 --> 15:15.282
<i>Over
the hills and down the path,</i>

15:15.315 --> 15:19.586
<i>closer and closer to home
at last!</i>

15:19.620 --> 15:22.724
<i>Where Mama
and Papa held him tight,</i>

15:22.757 --> 15:26.259
<i>loving him and hugging him
with all their might.</i>

15:26.293 --> 15:27.795
<i>"You scared us!"</i>

15:27.829 --> 15:29.663
<i>They yelled,
"You can't run away!</i>

15:29.696 --> 15:33.801
<i>We love you and need you
and want you to stay!"</i>

15:33.835 --> 15:36.536
<i>Baby goat cried,
hugging them back</i>

15:36.570 --> 15:38.538
<i>and promised
to always be good.</i>

15:38.572 --> 15:43.210
<i>And always he was
and never he did return</i>

15:43.243 --> 15:45.312
<i>to the darkened wood.</i>

15:51.485 --> 15:55.255
I'm glad
baby goat made it home, okay.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.924
Me too.

16:02.897 --> 16:05.666
He knew to get away
from that terrible noise!

16:07.735 --> 16:09.169
He sure did.

16:12.774 --> 16:14.341
Solomon?

16:14.374 --> 16:15.943
Yes?

16:20.647 --> 16:23.851
You asked me earlier,
what happens when we die.

16:23.885 --> 16:26.386
You said we change

16:26.420 --> 16:28.723
but I don't understand
about the butterfly.

16:28.756 --> 16:29.957
That's okay.

16:29.991 --> 16:33.260
No one does, not really.

16:33.293 --> 16:35.495
That's what faith is all about.

16:35.529 --> 16:37.197
Faith?

16:40.600 --> 16:42.636
You remember
when Millie got really sick

16:42.669 --> 16:44.005
and I said
she might not make it?

16:44.038 --> 16:46.339
You said,
"She might die,"

16:46.373 --> 16:48.675
but I said, "No way!"

16:48.710 --> 16:51.445
And you were right.

16:51.478 --> 16:52.814
She got better.

16:54.716 --> 16:56.884
That's what faith is about.

16:56.918 --> 17:00.420
It's when you believe in
something that you can't prove.

17:00.454 --> 17:04.290
You believe in it anyway
even though you can't see it.

17:06.993 --> 17:09.563
I think that's your gift,
Solomon.

17:14.001 --> 17:16.971
I have faith in a lot of things

17:17.003 --> 17:19.539
because I can't see anything.

17:23.477 --> 17:25.579
You are a good boy.

17:38.625 --> 17:39.794
Good night.

17:41.729 --> 17:43.497
I love you.

17:52.672 --> 17:54.608
Mama?

17:55.509 --> 17:56.878
Hmm?

17:56.911 --> 17:58.612
I have faith in you.

18:02.817 --> 18:05.920
I have faith in you too,
Solomon.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.928
<i>Solomon.</i>

18:46.961 --> 18:48.729
<i>Solomon, I am so sorry.</i>

18:51.132 --> 18:53.633
<i>I have to leave you now,
sweetheart.</i>

18:53.667 --> 18:56.137
<i>I cannot stay here.</i>

18:56.170 --> 18:58.405
<i>You will have to be strong
on your own</i>

18:58.438 --> 19:01.008
<i>like I know that you can.</i>

19:01.042 --> 19:04.444
<i>All you need to do
is follow our three rules</i>

19:04.477 --> 19:07.514
<i>and they will keep you safe
as they have always done.</i>

19:09.851 --> 19:13.821
<i>You remember our rules,
don't you, Solomon?</i>

19:13.855 --> 19:16.690
<i>The first rule.</i>

19:16.724 --> 19:18.558
<i>We must always give back
to the forest</i>

19:18.592 --> 19:21.162
<i>which provides for us.</i>

19:27.567 --> 19:32.006
<i>So when you hunt or scavenge,
do it for two:</i>

19:32.039 --> 19:35.475
<i>one for the forest
and one for you.</i>

19:38.813 --> 19:41.082
<i>The second rule.</i>

19:41.115 --> 19:43.084
<i>When your will
is almost gone</i>

19:43.117 --> 19:45.019
<i>and you feel like giving up,</i>

19:45.052 --> 19:47.755
<i>find comfort in singing
our song.</i>

19:59.834 --> 20:01.769
<i>The third and final rule,</i>

20:01.802 --> 20:05.006
<i>now, this is
the most important of all.</i>

20:05.039 --> 20:11.879
<i>Solomon, you must never,
ever let go of the rope.</i>

20:11.913 --> 20:14.614
<i>This rope is your guide.</i>

20:14.648 --> 20:16.650
<i>This land is your home.</i>

20:16.683 --> 20:19.720
<i>And the rope will keep you
safe from harm within it.</i>

20:19.754 --> 20:24.759
<i>So always hold onto it
and you will have hope.</i>

20:24.792 --> 20:29.897
<i>Whatever you do,
don't lose the rope.</i>

20:31.966 --> 20:33.200
<i>I love you.</i>

27:16.136 --> 27:21.041
<i>Whatever you do,
don't lose the rope.</i>

30:14.081 --> 30:15.549
Millie,
what happened, girl?

30:18.519 --> 30:20.254
Millie!

30:20.287 --> 30:22.022
Millie!

30:23.624 --> 30:25.225
Millie!

33:22.636 --> 33:24.972
Hey, boy, that's my deer.

33:41.621 --> 33:43.623
Stop. Easy, kid.

33:43.657 --> 33:45.258
I'm not gonna hurt you.

33:45.292 --> 33:48.963
- No.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Calm down. You're bleeding.

33:48.996 --> 33:50.932
Now, I'm just trying
to help you, kid.

33:53.735 --> 33:55.535
How are we here?

33:55.569 --> 33:56.636
Your rope.

33:57.772 --> 34:00.875
I figured you must have
something important attached.

34:00.908 --> 34:02.844
Wasn't expecting a house.

34:02.877 --> 34:04.578
Didn't want to lose it?

34:09.382 --> 34:11.953
Where are your parents, kid?

34:11.985 --> 34:13.587
Anyone else around here?

34:23.864 --> 34:25.264
I'm fine.

34:25.967 --> 34:28.635
I'm not... I'm not kid.

34:31.105 --> 34:33.572
'Course you're not.

34:33.607 --> 34:36.744
I apologize.
You don't seem like a kid.

34:37.978 --> 34:39.612
My name's Hank.

34:42.917 --> 34:44.018
Where's my rope?

34:44.985 --> 34:47.088
Rope's right here.

34:47.121 --> 34:49.356
I'll pass it to ya.

34:49.389 --> 34:50.858
Is your name Lucas?

34:52.059 --> 34:53.960
How do you know Lucas?

34:53.995 --> 34:57.098
I don't. I just saw
his name on that knife.

34:57.130 --> 34:59.533
Is it Lucas's knife?

34:59.566 --> 35:01.035
It's mine now.

35:02.069 --> 35:05.472
Well, what's your name, then?

35:07.975 --> 35:09.509
Solomon.

35:10.878 --> 35:12.612
Hello, Solomon.

35:12.646 --> 35:13.815
It's nice to meet you.

35:14.849 --> 35:16.550
Please don't stab me.

35:20.955 --> 35:22.824
Here's your rope.

35:29.663 --> 35:31.766
No one answered
your door earlier.

35:32.900 --> 35:35.335
Is anyone else
coming back here tonight?

35:40.775 --> 35:42.475
I'd be more than happy to

35:42.509 --> 35:45.079
finish helping you
clean up that cut.

35:45.112 --> 35:48.548
Give you a couple aspirin, in
exchange for

35:48.582 --> 35:50.084
a place to stay 'til mornin'.

35:54.454 --> 35:56.157
Aspirin?

35:56.190 --> 35:58.826
Yeah, aspirin.

35:58.860 --> 36:00.728
You don't know what aspirin is?

36:01.996 --> 36:03.396
No.

36:03.430 --> 36:04.832
It's a medicine

36:04.866 --> 36:06.968
to make the aches
and pains go away.

36:07.001 --> 36:09.103
Trust me,
you'll thank me for it.

36:10.570 --> 36:12.472
I don't need your help.

36:13.107 --> 36:14.842
I can see that...

36:15.943 --> 36:17.745
but I need your help, Solomon.

36:19.512 --> 36:21.749
I'll be blind in them woods
when that sun go down.

36:22.616 --> 36:24.584
And I don't
have a rope like you.

36:26.721 --> 36:28.655
But I have a deer.

36:28.688 --> 36:30.457
I could make us both dinner.

36:36.731 --> 36:39.699
Uh...

36:39.734 --> 36:41.869
I'll take that as a yes, then.

39:36.844 --> 39:38.979
<i>Solomon.</i>

39:39.013 --> 39:40.948
<i>Solomon, I am so sorry.</i>

39:43.284 --> 39:45.753
<i>I have to leave you now,
sweetheart.</i>

39:45.786 --> 39:48.289
<i>I cannot stay here.</i>

39:48.322 --> 39:50.257
<i>You will have to be strong
on your own</i>

39:50.291 --> 39:52.226
<i>like I know that you can.</i>

39:52.259 --> 39:54.795
<i>All you need to do</i>

39:54.829 --> 39:57.998
<i>is follow our three rules
and they will keep you safe</i>

39:58.032 --> 40:00.768
<i>as they have always done.</i>

40:00.801 --> 40:04.972
<i>You remember our rules,
don't you, Solomon?</i>

40:05.005 --> 40:07.942
<i>The first rule.</i>

40:07.975 --> 40:10.778
<i>We must always
give back to the forest</i>

40:10.811 --> 40:12.847
<i>which provides for us.</i>

40:17.852 --> 40:22.089
<i>So when you hunt or
scavenge, do it for two:</i>

40:22.123 --> 40:25.025
<i>one for the forest
and one for you.</i>

40:29.163 --> 40:31.198
<i>The second rule.</i>

40:31.232 --> 40:33.767
<i>When your will is
almost gone and you feel</i>

40:33.801 --> 40:37.104
<i>like giving up, find
comfort in singing our song.</i>

40:42.843 --> 40:45.779
<i>The third and final rule,</i>

40:45.813 --> 40:48.349
<i>now, this is the
most important of all.</i>

40:48.382 --> 40:51.218
<i>Solomon, you must never,
ever let go of the rope.</i>

40:51.252 --> 40:55.289
<i>This rope is your guide.
This land is your home.</i>

40:55.322 --> 40:58.691
<i>And the rope will keep
you safe from harm within it.</i>

40:58.726 --> 41:02.163
<i>So always hold onto
it and you will have hope.</i>

41:07.868 --> 41:10.704
<i>Whatever you do,</i>

41:10.738 --> 41:16.243
<i>don't lose the rope.
I love you.</i>

42:40.027 --> 42:41.862
I think it's ready!

42:47.534 --> 42:49.103
Thank you.

42:56.310 --> 42:57.444
Ya like it?

43:05.919 --> 43:08.455
Mind if I sleep in here
by the fire tonight?

43:10.224 --> 43:11.492
Okay.

43:19.533 --> 43:21.101
Hey, Solomon.

43:24.305 --> 43:26.507
If you want to go with me
in the morning,

43:26.540 --> 43:29.977
I could get you
somewhere safe.

43:30.010 --> 43:32.112
I just mean,
I noticed you were running low

43:32.146 --> 43:34.048
- on canned food and I could...
- No.

43:36.150 --> 43:38.185
Okay, fine.

43:38.218 --> 43:40.954
I just wanted to offer
some help.

43:41.388 --> 43:43.257
I don't need help.

43:50.964 --> 43:52.433
I love your home, too.

43:52.466 --> 43:54.935
And I wouldn't want
to leave it either.

44:01.308 --> 44:05.212
Hey, uh, I noticed the picture
of your mom and dad.

44:10.551 --> 44:13.454
You know,
you look so much like your mom.

44:13.487 --> 44:16.390
I mean, just like
your dad, too, but...

44:16.423 --> 44:18.392
so much like your mom.

44:21.161 --> 44:23.130
- I loved her.
- Mm.

44:27.301 --> 44:28.602
I'm tired.

44:30.604 --> 44:32.506
Sure, of course.

44:33.340 --> 44:35.876
I'm beat too.
It's been a long day.

44:36.677 --> 44:38.078
I'll clean up.

47:44.498 --> 47:46.834
The hell was that?

47:46.868 --> 47:48.602
Do you know what that was?

47:49.269 --> 47:50.337
No.

47:51.505 --> 47:53.407
Have you ever
heard that before?

47:53.440 --> 47:55.175
I don't think so.

47:55.208 --> 47:56.744
You don't think so?

47:58.445 --> 48:00.414
Well, it didn't sound good.

48:01.214 --> 48:02.784
Let me get a flashlight.

48:09.891 --> 48:11.625
Where are you going?

48:11.658 --> 48:14.328
To see what that was.

48:14.361 --> 48:16.263
It stopped.

48:16.296 --> 48:17.531
Stopped what though?

48:17.564 --> 48:19.399
I don't want it startin' again.

48:20.601 --> 48:22.402
What are you gonna do?

48:22.436 --> 48:24.504
Depends on what it is, I guess.

48:25.773 --> 48:27.641
You just stay here.

48:27.674 --> 48:29.142
I'll be right back.

48:29.176 --> 48:30.577
A'right?

51:07.034 --> 51:08.502
Solomon?

51:09.603 --> 51:11.638
Do you know what kind
of animal is out there?

51:14.341 --> 51:15.176
Do ya?

51:16.610 --> 51:18.278
I thought somethin'
was gon' kill me.

51:20.547 --> 51:22.449
Tell me if you know what it is.

51:46.073 --> 51:47.440
Whatever it is,

51:48.542 --> 51:50.377
it was big enough
to kill a bear.

51:50.745 --> 51:54.314
I mean, it wasn't a huge bear,
but it was a bear and bears...

51:54.749 --> 51:55.983
It's okay, Solomon.

51:56.784 --> 51:57.919
We're safe now.

52:00.154 --> 52:01.488
I think.

52:19.006 --> 52:21.008
How the hell
am I gon' get you outta here

52:21.042 --> 52:22.642
with that thing in them woods?

52:29.616 --> 52:30.751
It's nice.

52:31.451 --> 52:32.652
That song.

54:04.644 --> 54:06.446
Hey! Good morning!

54:10.284 --> 54:12.519
Thanks for letting me
stay here last night.

54:14.889 --> 54:17.657
Do you know anything about
what was out there last night?

54:27.768 --> 54:28.836
You know...

54:29.704 --> 54:33.040
there's a...
lot of deer left over.

54:34.942 --> 54:37.078
I was just thinking I could

54:37.111 --> 54:38.746
show you how to preserve it.

54:39.113 --> 54:41.215
Have a little deer jerky
around in the winter.

54:42.717 --> 54:45.753
Looks like you got
a old smoker right here.

54:45.786 --> 54:47.254
That was my dad's.

54:49.090 --> 54:50.858
What happened to him?

54:54.161 --> 54:55.262
He left.

54:58.966 --> 55:00.600
I'm sorry, Solomon.

55:04.772 --> 55:06.173
Well, I see a...

55:07.141 --> 55:09.076
lot of materials around here.

55:09.110 --> 55:10.211
We could build a new one.

55:11.812 --> 55:14.581
And grate,
some metal stakes.

55:16.951 --> 55:18.618
Yeah.

55:19.854 --> 55:21.088
I think...

55:21.688 --> 55:23.157
I can work with this.

55:24.025 --> 55:27.161
Now, do you happen
to have a chain?

55:27.194 --> 55:30.031
Uh, I found one before.

55:30.597 --> 55:31.732
In the woods.

55:32.133 --> 55:34.268
But it's stuck.

55:35.336 --> 55:36.837
Stuck to what?

55:37.972 --> 55:39.606
I don't know.

55:39.639 --> 55:41.608
Well, you have some
bolt cutters here.

55:41.641 --> 55:43.244
Can you take me so I can see?

55:46.747 --> 55:48.249
Yeah. I can...

55:48.282 --> 55:49.817
I can check my traps.

56:05.866 --> 56:07.234
Clever.

56:09.170 --> 56:11.338
Ah, there's nothing
in your trap.

56:26.821 --> 56:29.757
It's pretty amazing to me
how you move around so well

56:29.790 --> 56:31.125
with your rope.

56:31.826 --> 56:33.861
Mm. Rope is my guide.

56:36.030 --> 56:37.198
It's around here.

56:37.832 --> 56:40.234
Well, there's a whole heck

56:40.267 --> 56:42.369
of a lot of
around here, Solomon.

56:43.771 --> 56:45.672
You gon' have to throw me
a bone here, kid.

56:47.875 --> 56:50.878
Oh, it's right here!
You were right, Solomon.

56:50.911 --> 56:52.046
It's right here.

57:11.966 --> 57:14.368
Does look like it's attached
to something, doesn't it?

57:15.836 --> 57:17.138
Let's see what it is.

57:19.173 --> 57:20.841
I guess you're not coming?

57:24.411 --> 57:25.678
No.

57:28.716 --> 57:30.918
A'right, you stay right there.
I'll be right back.

58:01.282 --> 58:02.750
Oh, shit!

58:19.433 --> 58:22.403
I don't know,
it goes into some kind of den.

58:23.270 --> 58:24.705
I couldn't pull it out.

58:25.139 --> 58:27.007
A den?

58:27.041 --> 58:28.409
Some kind of hole
in the ground.

58:29.076 --> 58:30.811
It don't really matter,
though, I guess.

58:30.844 --> 58:32.112
We got what we need.

58:53.434 --> 58:54.902
Hey, uh...

58:55.402 --> 58:56.804
Will the deer fit?

58:57.905 --> 58:59.273
No, no,

58:59.306 --> 59:01.141
we will have more than enough

59:01.175 --> 59:03.377
left over to cook regular.

59:04.912 --> 59:05.980
Yeah.

59:11.852 --> 59:13.821
Can I have a piece?

59:13.854 --> 59:17.024
Yeah. I just said
we have plenty.

59:20.928 --> 59:21.996
A'right, now.

01:00:17.217 --> 01:00:19.386
Solomon!
What are you doing?

01:00:21.255 --> 01:00:23.123
Hunt and scavenge
do it for two,

01:00:23.891 --> 01:00:26.827
one for the forest
and one for you.

01:00:28.062 --> 01:00:30.331
What the hell is that?
Witchcraft?

01:00:31.565 --> 01:00:33.967
You always throw
dead animals out here?

01:00:34.635 --> 01:00:36.136
Uh, yes.

01:00:37.671 --> 01:00:39.640
Well, that explains
why some animal

01:00:39.673 --> 01:00:42.176
was prowling around last night.

01:00:44.578 --> 01:00:46.413
What say you and I go find out

01:00:46.447 --> 01:00:48.449
what kind of beast that was
while it's light out.

01:00:50.951 --> 01:00:52.019
I can't.

01:00:53.153 --> 01:00:54.521
You won't... I'll be right here
to help you, Solomon...

01:00:54.555 --> 01:00:55.889
No, Hank!

01:00:56.557 --> 01:00:58.325
So you do remember my name?

01:00:59.993 --> 01:01:02.363
Why? Can't lose the rope?

01:01:03.464 --> 01:01:05.099
I can help you with that, too.

01:01:05.132 --> 01:01:06.500
You just have
to trust me a little.

01:01:07.201 --> 01:01:09.470
Whatever is out there
ain't gon' go away

01:01:09.503 --> 01:01:11.238
if you keep feeding it.

01:01:11.271 --> 01:01:13.040
We can set a trap for it.

01:01:14.375 --> 01:01:16.543
I mean,
unless you just feel safe

01:01:16.577 --> 01:01:19.213
all alone out here,
that's cool.

01:01:21.148 --> 01:01:22.683
You probably right.
You got this under control,

01:01:22.717 --> 01:01:23.984
all on your own.

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:27.187
How?

01:01:27.722 --> 01:01:29.223
How you got it under control?

01:01:30.591 --> 01:01:32.059
How can you help me?

01:02:06.593 --> 01:02:09.229
You can stay tied up
just as safe with this.

01:02:10.197 --> 01:02:12.633
It will just give you
a little more freedom is all.

01:02:12.666 --> 01:02:15.135
And you don't have
to worry about my knots.

01:02:15.169 --> 01:02:17.404
I spent the first half
of my life on a boat.

01:02:19.206 --> 01:02:21.308
You hear that?

01:02:22.075 --> 01:02:23.310
Strong like bull!

01:02:24.344 --> 01:02:25.412
Now feel it.

01:02:26.013 --> 01:02:28.282
Yeah! America-made!

01:02:30.017 --> 01:02:31.084
Strong like bull.

01:02:33.755 --> 01:02:34.988
Okay.

01:02:35.389 --> 01:02:36.690
'Kay. Okay.

01:02:55.409 --> 01:02:58.178
All right, let me get
one more thing.

01:03:12.626 --> 01:03:15.662
Come on. Let's go get
this sumbitch.

01:03:19.834 --> 01:03:22.102
I got you, kid.
Hold on. Let's go.

01:03:32.212 --> 01:03:34.248
Uh, is this
where you seen it?

01:03:35.082 --> 01:03:37.351
Yeah, well, somewhere
around here.

01:03:44.525 --> 01:03:46.460
I don't think
it's around here now.

01:03:46.493 --> 01:03:47.594
I hope not.

01:03:49.296 --> 01:03:51.064
But between you and me,

01:03:51.098 --> 01:03:53.400
I think we've reached
the end of our hope.

01:03:55.702 --> 01:03:56.771
Huh?

01:03:56.804 --> 01:03:58.205
It's a joke.

01:04:00.107 --> 01:04:01.508
Never mind.

01:04:01.542 --> 01:04:03.677
Old man, knuckle sandwich joke.

01:04:04.311 --> 01:04:06.179
Hank!

01:04:07.281 --> 01:04:08.649
Solomon!

01:04:09.516 --> 01:04:11.118
Hank!

01:04:14.488 --> 01:04:15.790
Solomon!

01:04:22.797 --> 01:04:25.232
Come on,
let me get you outta here.

01:04:25.767 --> 01:04:28.201
Let me get you home.
It's not safe out here.

01:04:28.235 --> 01:04:30.671
Come on, I got you. I got you.

01:04:30.705 --> 01:04:32.439
Come on, come on.

01:04:34.308 --> 01:04:36.610
Follow me. I got you.
I got you, kid.

01:04:48.255 --> 01:04:50.657
We safe now. Don't worry.

01:04:52.192 --> 01:04:54.328
Whatever that was
can't get in here.

01:04:55.429 --> 01:04:57.097
That trap will get it quick.

01:04:59.466 --> 01:05:00.735
You okay.

01:05:04.872 --> 01:05:06.139
Hold on.

01:05:08.241 --> 01:05:10.310
I saw somethin' last night.

01:05:21.254 --> 01:05:26.660
Was your mother's name
Nye-dia by any chance?

01:05:28.863 --> 01:05:30.130
Nydia.

01:05:31.398 --> 01:05:33.367
Did you know
she wrote a journal?

01:05:35.402 --> 01:05:36.470
What?

01:05:36.503 --> 01:05:37.872
I found her journal.

01:05:39.907 --> 01:05:44.211
"To the joy of my life,
Solomon."

01:05:44.645 --> 01:05:47.749
And she signed it, "Nydia."

01:05:50.217 --> 01:05:51.451
What does it say?

01:05:51.986 --> 01:05:54.187
I don't know.
You want me to read it?

01:05:59.994 --> 01:06:02.429
She had beautiful handwritin'.

01:06:04.598 --> 01:06:05.699
"Sunday.

01:06:06.633 --> 01:06:08.702
Happy birthday, Solomon.

01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:13.373
I cannot believe
you are four years old today.

01:06:14.474 --> 01:06:17.678
How have four years
come and gone so quickly?

01:06:19.346 --> 01:06:23.517
I broke down in tears
last week when I realized

01:06:23.550 --> 01:06:26.954
you were not going to be
three anymore.

01:06:27.989 --> 01:06:31.859
I told your father
that I was heartbroken

01:06:31.893 --> 01:06:35.963
because I could barely
remember you as an infant now."

01:06:38.465 --> 01:06:41.535
"He got this journal
so I could

01:06:41.568 --> 01:06:44.939
write down all of the things
we'd do together

01:06:44.972 --> 01:06:46.573
and not forget.

01:06:47.008 --> 01:06:49.711
He meant it as a gift for you.

01:06:50.912 --> 01:06:52.714
But I think it's more for me."

01:06:54.614 --> 01:06:57.651
"I doubt you will care
as much about how cute

01:06:57.684 --> 01:07:00.888
your little fingers
are in the grass..."

01:07:00.922 --> 01:07:02.757
"As you...

01:07:02.790 --> 01:07:04.792
try to catch a grasshopper

01:07:04.826 --> 01:07:09.030
or how your laugh
can pull me from sorrow

01:07:09.063 --> 01:07:11.866
and transform me
back to paradise.

01:07:14.001 --> 01:07:19.974
Your father and I
love you so much, Solomon.

01:07:24.812 --> 01:07:26.313
Tuesday.

01:07:27.347 --> 01:07:31.753
I couldn't understand it.
I was heartbroken.

01:07:32.954 --> 01:07:34.654
I don't know why.

01:07:35.455 --> 01:07:37.859
I just wanted
to keep you safe.

01:07:38.826 --> 01:07:42.029
I think that's all
any mother really wants.

01:07:44.397 --> 01:07:46.868
I told Lucas
that you belong here.

01:07:47.869 --> 01:07:50.504
The ache for home
lives in all of us,

01:07:51.005 --> 01:07:54.307
the safe place
where we can go as we are

01:07:54.341 --> 01:07:56.409
and not be questioned.

01:07:56.811 --> 01:07:59.013
I don't think he agreed
with me, though.

01:08:00.081 --> 01:08:03.617
He can seem so different
from me sometimes.

01:08:04.484 --> 01:08:09.857
All I have to do
is hold you close, Solomon.

01:08:11.859 --> 01:08:13.627
You console my heart.

01:08:14.494 --> 01:08:17.865
It dances in delight
when we sing together."

01:08:19.366 --> 01:08:21.368
Just thinking of our lullaby

01:08:21.401 --> 01:08:22.904
can sooth my soul.

01:08:24.437 --> 01:08:28.075
I love you.
Good night, Solomon."

01:08:34.481 --> 01:08:37.384
Hmm.

01:08:45.993 --> 01:08:47.060
Here we go.

01:08:49.595 --> 01:08:51.398
"Wednesday.

01:08:52.631 --> 01:08:55.602
I cannot believe
he tried to take...

01:09:04.078 --> 01:09:05.645
What?

01:09:05.679 --> 01:09:07.447
What is it?
Why'd you stop reading?

01:09:08.049 --> 01:09:12.720
Um, it's getting really late.
Uh, that's enough for tonight.

01:09:12.752 --> 01:09:14.688
No, please, Hank,
just some more...

01:09:14.721 --> 01:09:16.122
How 'bout we get some shut eye?

01:09:18.792 --> 01:09:20.627
- Not tonight.
- Okay.

01:09:29.103 --> 01:09:32.006
<i>Never, ever let go</i>

01:09:32.038 --> 01:09:33.841
<i>of the rope.</i>

01:09:33.875 --> 01:09:38.112
<i>This rope is your guide.
This land is your home.</i>

01:09:38.145 --> 01:09:41.115
<i>And the rope will keep
you safe from harm within it.</i>

01:09:41.148 --> 01:09:46.486
<i>So always hold onto it
and you will have hope.</i>

01:09:46.519 --> 01:09:53.828
<i>Whatever you do,
don't lose the rope.</i>

01:09:53.861 --> 01:09:54.929
<i>I love you.</i>

01:13:13.961 --> 01:13:15.029
Hank?

01:13:20.134 --> 01:13:21.235
Hank!

01:13:43.724 --> 01:13:44.792
Hank!

01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:49.296
Hank?

01:17:29.216 --> 01:17:31.452
<i>I cannot stay here.</i>

01:17:31.485 --> 01:17:33.921
<i>You will have to be
strong on your own</i>

01:17:33.954 --> 01:17:36.490
<i>like I know that you can.</i>

01:17:36.523 --> 01:17:39.560
<i>All you need to do is
follow our three rules</i>

01:17:39.593 --> 01:17:41.528
<i>and they will keep you safe
as they have always...</i>

01:17:45.132 --> 01:17:47.267
<i>You remember our rules,
don't you, Solomon?</i>

01:17:49.403 --> 01:17:51.372
<i>The first rule:</i>

01:17:51.405 --> 01:17:53.674
<i>we must always give back
to the forest</i>

01:17:53.708 --> 01:17:55.075
<i>which provides for us.</i>

01:17:59.079 --> 01:18:02.983
<i>So when you hunt or scavenge,
do it for two:</i>

01:18:03.016 --> 01:18:06.954
<i>one for the forest
and one for you.</i>

01:18:11.492 --> 01:18:13.594
<i>The second rule:</i>

01:18:13.627 --> 01:18:17.598
<i>when your will is almost gone
and you feel like giving up,</i>

01:18:17.631 --> 01:18:20.534
<i>find comfort
in singing our song...</i>

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:34.948
<i>The third and final rule,</i>

01:18:34.982 --> 01:18:37.551
<i>now, this is the most
important rule of all:</i>

01:18:37.584 --> 01:18:44.191
<i>Solomon, you must never,
ever let go of the rope.</i>

01:18:44.224 --> 01:18:48.629
<i>This rope is your guide.
This land is your home.</i>

01:18:48.662 --> 01:18:52.032
<i>And the rope will keep
you safe from harm within it.</i>

01:18:52.065 --> 01:18:56.503
<i>So always hold onto it
and you will have hope.</i>

01:18:56.537 --> 01:19:01.241
<i>Whatever you do,
don't lose the rope.</i>

01:19:01.275 --> 01:19:03.444
Hank!

01:19:03.477 --> 01:19:05.512
- Hank!
- <i>I love you.</i>

01:19:16.657 --> 01:19:17.524
Hank!

01:19:19.693 --> 01:19:20.627
Hank!

01:19:22.429 --> 01:19:23.630
Hank!

01:22:59.714 --> 01:23:00.848
Mother.
