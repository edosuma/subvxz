00:02.535 --> 00:04.770
[Crow caws]

00:04.771 --> 00:06.104
Frankie: Waiting sucks.

00:06.105 --> 00:07.906
You wait at the post office,

00:07.907 --> 00:09.141
you wait at the bank,

00:09.142 --> 00:10.475
you wait behind the old lady

00:10.476 --> 00:11.943
writing a check at the grocery store.

00:11.945 --> 00:13.579
But the longest wait of all

00:13.580 --> 00:15.747
is waiting to see if you've
gotten into college.

00:15.748 --> 00:17.816
Frankie: Hear anything yet?

00:17.817 --> 00:19.885
Nope. Still nothing.

00:19.886 --> 00:22.321
But we all had ways of dealing with it.

00:22.322 --> 00:25.157
Sue immersed herself in an
arts-and-crafts project,

00:25.158 --> 00:28.160
Mike cleaned all our crap
out of the dining room,

00:28.161 --> 00:30.596
and I rejoined curves.

00:30.597 --> 00:32.865
Look, making the call is the hardest part.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.167
[Sighs] Frankie, I'm trying to make room

00:35.168 --> 00:36.602
for aunt Edie's table.

00:36.603 --> 00:38.737
I can't believe how much
junk you got in here.

00:38.738 --> 00:40.672
A food dehydrator? Really?

00:40.673 --> 00:42.908
Isn't our food already dry
and tasteless enough?

00:42.909 --> 00:44.610
That's sentimental.

00:44.611 --> 00:46.879
I got it from my mom when I gave
it to her and she didn't like it.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.014
Well, we just can't keep piling stuff up.

00:49.015 --> 00:51.583
All right, we'll sell it on Craigslist.

00:51.584 --> 00:53.018
We can't even take a picture on our phone.

00:53.019 --> 00:54.086
That's not gonna happen.

00:54.087 --> 00:56.054
Axl: don't touch it! Don't you touch it!

00:56.055 --> 00:57.623
Don't you dare touch it!

00:57.624 --> 00:59.124
- [Indistinct shouting]
- You're closer.

00:59.125 --> 01:00.643
Brick: Every square inch is covered

01:00.644 --> 01:02.161
- with your stuff!
- Cut it out!

01:02.162 --> 01:03.195
I'm sorry.

01:03.196 --> 01:04.629
I can't live in this clutter anymore.

01:04.631 --> 01:05.731
I just can't.

01:05.732 --> 01:07.566
This isn't the room of a man of words,

01:07.567 --> 01:09.134
it's a room of a man of sweat socks.

01:09.135 --> 01:10.903
There's no space for my thoughts.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.704
Put your thoughts in the dining room.
That's the junk area.

01:12.705 --> 01:14.740
We're not doing that anymore.
Now it's the basement.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.708
I'm sorry, but his garbage is everywhere.

01:16.709 --> 01:18.577
I found pool balls under my bed!

01:18.578 --> 01:19.878
I am learning to juggle!

01:19.879 --> 01:21.780
I'm trying to better
myself, unlike you people.

01:21.781 --> 01:23.315
Dad, it's my room now.

01:23.316 --> 01:25.250
He doesn't even live here anymore.

01:25.251 --> 01:27.653
This is my spring break, and
this is my vacation home.

01:27.654 --> 01:29.288
So much sadness in that sentence.

01:29.289 --> 01:31.590
Look, you guys are old
enough to figure this out,

01:31.591 --> 01:32.792
so figure it out.

01:34.661 --> 01:35.962
[Door closes]

01:40.633 --> 01:41.667
Hey, mom,

01:41.668 --> 01:43.001
check it out!

01:43.002 --> 01:45.070
It's a potpourri sachet.

01:45.071 --> 01:47.239
I'm making one of these for
every senior in my class

01:47.240 --> 01:49.641
as a little souvenir of our time together.

01:49.642 --> 01:51.143
"Sue" -venir?

01:51.144 --> 01:52.311
Get it? [Chuckles]

01:52.312 --> 01:53.312
Aww.

01:53.313 --> 01:56.348
"Class of 2015. Aromaderci.

01:56.349 --> 01:59.017
- Our future smells bright."
- [Chuckles]

01:59.018 --> 02:00.652
Clever.

02:00.653 --> 02:02.754
I got to say, honey, I'm impressed.

02:02.755 --> 02:04.323
This is a really nervous time,

02:04.324 --> 02:06.325
you know, waiting to hear about college,

02:06.326 --> 02:07.759
and you're handling it great.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.928
Well, it's out of my hands.

02:09.929 --> 02:11.730
- What are you gonna do?
- [Chuckles] You're right.

02:11.731 --> 02:14.166
You just got to find ways to
not let the stress get to you.

02:14.167 --> 02:16.034
That's all you can do. [Sniffs]

02:16.035 --> 02:18.337
There is no reason it
should take this long.

02:18.338 --> 02:20.806
Carly's heard. Sue should have heard.

02:20.807 --> 02:22.040
[Sighs]

02:22.041 --> 02:23.742
Those colleges know exactly
what they're doing, Mike.

02:23.743 --> 02:24.743
They're just not telling us.

02:24.744 --> 02:26.878
Why won't they tell us? Why?!

02:26.879 --> 02:28.680
Okay, you got to get it together, lady.

02:28.681 --> 02:30.582
[Sighs] I'm trying!

02:30.583 --> 02:33.585
Reading a magazine doesn't help.
Working out doesn't help.

02:33.586 --> 02:34.653
You been working out?

02:34.654 --> 02:36.655
Hey, I'm getting my photo
taken for my I.D. tomorrow,

02:36.656 --> 02:38.023
so back off.

02:38.024 --> 02:40.359
- Look, Frankie, you got to calm down.
- [Sighs]

02:40.360 --> 02:41.860
Sue's gonna get in somewhere.

02:41.861 --> 02:43.862
Is she, Mike? Is she?!

02:43.863 --> 02:46.198
Ugh, I just want this for her, you know?

02:46.199 --> 02:49.968
She's so good and so kind and
she doesn't make anything,

02:49.969 --> 02:52.738
and if this one thing
could just go her way...

02:52.739 --> 02:54.573
[gasps] We should pray, Mike.

02:54.574 --> 02:56.642
Let's go to church. Is church open now?

02:56.643 --> 02:57.644
Never mind. I'll pray right now.

02:59.646 --> 03:02.047
Ow! Ohh. I just hurt my knee.

03:02.048 --> 03:05.217
Now there's no way I can work out tomorrow.

03:05.218 --> 03:06.219
[Sighs]

03:10.189 --> 03:11.723
Mike: What are you doing?

03:11.724 --> 03:15.160
It's cold, but I want to get a tan.

03:15.161 --> 03:17.796
Everybody else is in
Florida, but I didn't go.

03:17.797 --> 03:19.631
You got off cheap. You're welcome.

03:19.632 --> 03:22.634
Oh, gee, I wish there was
some way we could thank you.

03:22.635 --> 03:24.102
Oh, I know.

03:24.103 --> 03:26.204
How about we let you get up and
help us with the groceries?

03:26.205 --> 03:28.707
Oh. [Groans]

03:28.708 --> 03:30.576
[Grunts loudly]

03:36.616 --> 03:38.684
Mike: What the hell?

03:38.685 --> 03:40.619
Why's your stuff in here?

03:40.620 --> 03:42.321
Why is my stuff in here?

03:42.322 --> 03:43.655
Why's his stuff in here?

03:43.656 --> 03:46.024
Oh, I got tired of all Axl's
stuff clogging up my space,

03:46.025 --> 03:47.659
so I moved it in here.

03:47.660 --> 03:49.661
You moved all of this by yourself?

03:49.662 --> 03:51.129
Hate makes you strong.

03:51.130 --> 03:52.731
Oh, no. [Bag thuds]

03:52.732 --> 03:53.765
No way!

03:53.766 --> 03:56.601
Actually, wait a minute.

03:56.602 --> 03:57.603
Huh!

04:00.606 --> 04:01.940
- Not bad.
- Mm.

04:01.941 --> 04:03.108
Frankie: Oh, no, no, no, no.

04:03.109 --> 04:04.643
No. This is not happening.

04:04.644 --> 04:06.345
We are bringing in aunt Edie's table.

04:06.346 --> 04:08.213
I'm finally getting my dining room back.

04:08.214 --> 04:09.881
I thought you took care of this.

04:09.882 --> 04:11.583
I told them they were old
enough to figure it out.

04:11.584 --> 04:12.651
What?

04:12.652 --> 04:14.886
Yeah, some people's kids can
figure things out, not ours.

04:14.887 --> 04:15.987
We're not the Donahues.

04:15.988 --> 04:17.723
We don't have Donahue family court,

04:17.724 --> 04:19.591
where the kids present their case

04:19.591 --> 04:20.858
and Nancy and Ron vote on it

04:20.860 --> 04:23.262
and they sentence the
loser to 5 to 10 hugs.

04:24.230 --> 04:25.731
Hey, Brick, before you go,

04:25.732 --> 04:27.099
could you, uh... [Whistles]

04:27.100 --> 04:28.167
Ah. [Clicks tongue]

04:29.502 --> 04:30.569
Axl: Uh, mom and dad,

04:30.570 --> 04:32.070
I don't hang out in your room.

04:32.071 --> 04:34.574
Would you mind taking that somewhere else?

04:39.011 --> 04:41.680
Oh, my God, Sue, these
Sue-venirs are genius.

04:41.681 --> 04:43.648
My review is in, and they're a smash.

04:43.649 --> 04:45.016
Oh, you think?

04:45.017 --> 04:47.018
I was worried I might have
put too much clove in them.

04:47.019 --> 04:48.153
Not everybody likes clove.

04:48.154 --> 04:49.688
It's a very divisive spice.

04:49.689 --> 04:50.689
Mm.

04:50.690 --> 04:51.990
- [Knock on door]
- Man: Brad,

04:51.991 --> 04:53.859
you want to hit the batting cages?

04:53.860 --> 04:55.794
No, dad. Wait for it.

04:55.795 --> 04:57.629
Three, two, one.

04:57.630 --> 04:58.797
You sure?

04:58.798 --> 05:00.732
Yes.

05:00.733 --> 05:02.033
Every day. [Chuckles]

05:02.034 --> 05:03.568
[Scoffs]

05:03.569 --> 05:05.937
So, h-how are you doing with
the whole waiting thing?

05:05.938 --> 05:07.706
'Cause I know that for some people,

05:07.707 --> 05:09.708
it's starting to get a
little bit stressful.

05:09.709 --> 05:11.243
Actually, I have some good news,

05:11.244 --> 05:13.578
but I wasn't gonna tell it if
you're not in a place to hear it.

05:13.579 --> 05:14.913
Oh, no, I'm in a place,
a perfectly good place.

05:14.914 --> 05:15.914
Spill it.

05:15.915 --> 05:17.115
Okay.

05:17.116 --> 05:19.084
I've decided, instead of
going to college next year,

05:19.085 --> 05:21.119
I'm gonna do a year of
service to my country.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.788
You joined the army?

05:22.789 --> 05:23.789
Oh, no.

05:23.790 --> 05:24.790
Although I always thought

05:24.791 --> 05:26.158
I'd look pretty cute in the costumes.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.359
I signed up for Americorps.

05:27.360 --> 05:28.693
Oh, my God!

05:28.694 --> 05:29.861
That is so great!

05:29.862 --> 05:32.097
I love you. I love America.

05:32.098 --> 05:34.766
What could go better together
than the two things I love?!

05:34.767 --> 05:36.001
What is Americorps?

05:36.002 --> 05:38.737
It's kind of like the peace
corps, but for America.

05:38.738 --> 05:40.138
Not sure what I'll be doing for them yet...

05:40.139 --> 05:43.041
Maybe teaching kids, maybe building houses.

05:43.042 --> 05:44.676
Hey, that could bring me and my dad closer.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.344
I'll ask him how a hammer works. [Chuckles]

05:46.345 --> 05:49.648
Oh, I am so excited for you!

05:49.649 --> 05:50.749
And a little jealous.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.184
You don't even have to
worry about college yet.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.285
Oh, I didn't tell you?

05:53.286 --> 05:54.987
I'm deferring for a year. I got into NYU.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.857
Oh, wow!

05:58.858 --> 06:01.593
That's amazing.

06:01.594 --> 06:03.895
So, I guess you know what you're doing

06:03.896 --> 06:06.231
and Carly knows what she's doing

06:06.232 --> 06:09.601
and everybody knows what they're doing...

06:09.602 --> 06:12.038
Except me.

06:14.707 --> 06:16.708
Wow!

06:16.709 --> 06:19.311
This room is bigger than I thought.

06:19.312 --> 06:21.079
And what's that smell?

06:21.080 --> 06:23.281
Oh, it's a new fragrance I'm working on.

06:23.282 --> 06:26.652
It's called "not Axl," by Brick.

06:28.287 --> 06:30.021
You know, mom,

06:30.022 --> 06:32.224
so often people say they're
going to do things in life

06:32.225 --> 06:33.692
and they never, ever do them.

06:33.693 --> 06:35.727
I'm calling the curves lady
back to make my appointment.

06:35.728 --> 06:36.862
I just couldn't find the number.

06:36.863 --> 06:38.330
I'm not talking about you.

06:38.331 --> 06:41.132
Okay. But I am calling.

06:41.133 --> 06:42.267
Mm-hmm.

06:42.268 --> 06:44.135
I've read so many novels in my life

06:44.136 --> 06:46.071
and I've always dreamed that
someday I would write one,

06:46.072 --> 06:49.107
but until I cleared the
Axl out of my headspace,

06:49.108 --> 06:50.709
that dream felt impossible...

06:50.710 --> 06:52.177
- Until today.
- [Typewriter dings]

06:52.178 --> 06:53.678
Today, I realized that...

06:53.679 --> 06:55.280
Sue: I got an e-mail from Purdue!

06:55.281 --> 06:57.315
Axl: [Groggily] Can you keep it down?

06:57.316 --> 06:59.284
I'm trying to sleep!

06:59.285 --> 07:01.753
[Breathing heavily] What does it say?

07:01.754 --> 07:04.256
[Sighs] I haven't opened it yet.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.691
Okay, here I go.

07:06.692 --> 07:07.792
[Computer dings]

07:07.793 --> 07:10.729
- Buffering, buffering, buffering...
- [Computer chimes]

07:10.730 --> 07:11.864
Okay.

07:13.866 --> 07:15.700
Wait-listed.

07:15.701 --> 07:17.669
Aw.

07:17.670 --> 07:18.670
That's all right.

07:18.671 --> 07:20.138
They haven't said yes,

07:20.139 --> 07:22.307
but they haven't said no.

07:22.308 --> 07:23.675
Exactly.

07:23.676 --> 07:24.709
And, you know, there's still

07:24.710 --> 07:26.611
a lot of other colleges to hear from.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.647
Yeah. Exactly.

07:28.648 --> 07:29.748
And you know what?

07:29.749 --> 07:31.750
This wasn't even my first choice, anyway.

07:31.751 --> 07:34.019
And it could still end up being a yes.

07:34.020 --> 07:35.922
Right. So, we're good.

07:36.923 --> 07:39.124
[Groans] We're screwed!

07:39.125 --> 07:40.258
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

07:40.259 --> 07:42.060
I'm seriously gonna throw up.

07:42.061 --> 07:43.728
Mind getting off the bed then?

07:43.729 --> 07:44.763
Ugh.

07:44.764 --> 07:47.032
I just wanted the first one to be a yes.
[Sighs]

07:47.033 --> 07:49.901
Why couldn't the first one be a yes?!

07:49.902 --> 07:52.304
Oh, stupid Purdue.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.705
You know what?

07:53.706 --> 07:55.206
When they change their minds and say yes,

07:55.207 --> 07:56.207
we're gonna turn them down.

07:56.208 --> 07:57.709
Unless they're the only one.

16:31.890 --> 16:34.592
Did you think I would find
any part of that enjoyable?

16:34.593 --> 16:36.094
Well, come on.

16:36.095 --> 16:38.663
You tease people all the time

16:38.664 --> 16:41.199
with your quick, little digs
and your sarcastic comments,

16:41.200 --> 16:45.103
and the one time we tease you,
you stab my table?

16:45.104 --> 16:47.605
I mean, I only had it for two days, Mike.

16:47.606 --> 16:49.340
It's not a comfortable thing for me.

16:49.341 --> 16:50.641
Do you get that?

16:50.642 --> 16:53.177
Why are you embarrassed that
there's a fun side to you?

16:53.178 --> 16:54.579
If you want to be embarrassed,

16:54.580 --> 16:56.347
be embarrassed that you've
worn a flannel shirt

16:56.348 --> 16:58.015
every day for the last 30 years.

16:58.016 --> 17:00.685
It's not like I go around
singing all the time.

17:00.686 --> 17:02.320
It was just a stress reliever,

17:02.321 --> 17:04.188
something to blow off some steam.

17:04.189 --> 17:06.656
This whole Sue college
thing is making me nuts.

17:06.657 --> 17:08.126
Aha! I knew it!

17:08.127 --> 17:09.660
You're going around,

17:09.661 --> 17:12.829
acting like you're Mr. "oh, I'm
a big tree with no feelings,"

17:12.830 --> 17:14.598
and you are just as nervous as I am.

17:14.599 --> 17:17.201
A rejection and a wait list?

17:17.202 --> 17:18.603
That's not good, Frankie.

17:18.604 --> 17:20.137
[Sighs] Why can't it be good news?

17:20.138 --> 17:21.305
She doesn't deserve this.

17:21.306 --> 17:23.674
Hey, the next one's gonna be yes.

17:23.675 --> 17:25.309
[Sighs] It's got to be, right?

17:25.310 --> 17:26.711
I don't know.

17:26.712 --> 17:27.979
[Sighs] It's a lot harder

17:27.980 --> 17:29.847
than when we were trying
to get into school.

17:29.848 --> 17:31.649
Colleges get a lot more applications now.

17:31.650 --> 17:33.217
Ugh. That's true.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.086
And they might take a kid that
doesn't need financial aid

17:35.087 --> 17:36.287
over one that does.

17:36.288 --> 17:39.657
Oh, my God. I didn't even think about that.

17:39.658 --> 17:40.658
- Mm-hmm.
- Ugh.

17:40.659 --> 17:41.993
Thanks for not telling me before.

17:41.994 --> 17:43.794
I really would have lost it.

17:43.795 --> 17:45.063
That was you not losing it?

17:47.132 --> 17:49.735
I just really want this for her.

18:47.259 --> 18:48.726
Well, hurry up.

18:48.727 --> 18:50.294
We're eating dinner in here,
and I have to set the table.

18:50.295 --> 18:51.997
Spoons only.

18:53.665 --> 18:54.932
Well, I did it.

18:54.933 --> 18:56.200
You finished the book?

18:56.201 --> 18:57.969
No, I've got a second sentence.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.338
"The floorboard creaked as
he stepped in the room,

19:00.339 --> 19:03.809
sending up a cloud of dust
sparkling in the sunlight."

19:05.244 --> 19:07.845
- [Folder thuds]
- Oh, who am I kidding? It's crap.

19:07.846 --> 19:10.615
This sentence is just a cheap
imitation of the first one.

19:10.616 --> 19:12.717
Now I'm questioning my first sentence.

19:12.718 --> 19:14.986
I think I need to take a sabbatical,

19:14.987 --> 19:18.122
just step back from both
sentences and clear my head,

19:18.123 --> 19:19.891
perhaps backpack through Europe for a year.

19:22.661 --> 19:25.229
Oh, my God. East Indiana State.

19:25.230 --> 19:28.566
Brick: That first sentence was
my "to kill a mockingbird."

19:28.567 --> 19:30.334
[Keyboard clacks]

19:30.335 --> 19:32.337
[Indistinct conversations]

19:38.343 --> 19:40.044
Aah!

19:40.045 --> 19:42.280
Frankie: What?! What is it?! What is it?!

19:42.281 --> 19:43.981
[Stammering]

19:43.982 --> 19:45.816
What? What? What? Are you happy or sad?

19:45.817 --> 19:46.984
Happy or sad? What is it?

19:46.985 --> 19:49.287
Eastern... Eastern Indiana State.

19:49.288 --> 19:50.288
Okay, wait. Wait. Wait.

19:50.289 --> 19:51.322
What's it say? Wait. Wait. Wait.

19:51.323 --> 19:52.356
Somebody read it.

19:52.357 --> 19:54.792
- Sh-she's in.
- She's in!

19:54.793 --> 19:56.927
- Aah!
- That's my girl!

19:56.928 --> 19:58.930
[Laughter]

20:00.632 --> 20:03.200
- Yeah!
- [Laughs]

20:03.201 --> 20:04.735
Clearly, admission standards

20:04.736 --> 20:07.605
have lowered significantly since I got in.

20:07.606 --> 20:09.041
Congrats. You're a dragon.

20:10.676 --> 20:13.044
"Dear Sue Sue Heck,

20:13.045 --> 20:15.713
"it is our pleasure to welcome you

20:15.714 --> 20:18.182
to the east Indiana state class of 2019!"

20:18.183 --> 20:19.350
Now, that's a sentence.

20:19.351 --> 20:20.818
Whoo! Whoo!

20:20.819 --> 20:22.787
Five more acceptances came in that week,

20:22.788 --> 20:24.155
and I jumped so much,

20:24.156 --> 20:26.657
there was really no reason
for me to go to curves.

20:26.658 --> 20:29.027
I mean, it's better to start on
the first of the month, anyway.

20:32.631 --> 20:34.598
- [TV chatter]
- [Sighs]

20:34.599 --> 20:37.301
It's kind of nice to lie in
bed and watch the big TV.

20:37.302 --> 20:39.570
- And the kitchen's not far away, either.
- Mm.

20:39.571 --> 20:40.938
Just think... a few more years,

20:40.939 --> 20:42.640
Brick will be off to college, too,

20:42.641 --> 20:44.575
and this will all be ours.

20:44.576 --> 20:46.310
Mm.

20:46.311 --> 20:48.112
How's it going, Brick?

20:48.113 --> 20:49.146
Oh, good.

20:49.147 --> 20:51.082
I'm starting work on a new novel.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.683
What happened to your old one?

20:52.684 --> 20:54.685
Well, I've got a great
idea for a new sentence,

20:54.686 --> 20:56.287
but it doesn't go with the old sentences.

20:56.288 --> 20:58.089
But I'm feeling good.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.690
Soon I'll have two novels under my belt.

20:59.691 --> 21:01.692
Plus, I'm noodling around

21:01.693 --> 21:04.096
with a word that'll make
a great short story.

21:05.997 --> 21:08.265
We've got two kids in college, a novelist,

21:08.266 --> 21:10.568
and we're drinking in the dining-room bed.

21:10.569 --> 21:12.737
- We're doing something right.
