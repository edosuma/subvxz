WEBVTT

00:07.200 --> 00:09.280
Previously on Meerkat Manor...

00:11.080 --> 00:12.800
Finnick s attempted burrow move

00:12.840 --> 00:15.840
put the Hakuna Matata pups
in danger...

00:18.040 --> 00:20.600
while pregnant Munchkin did
everything she could

00:20.640 --> 00:22.600
to avoid eviction.

00:25.040 --> 00:29.360
Daisy had led her Ubuntu family
back to the dry riverbed.

00:31.120 --> 00:35.080
And The Whiskers returned
to the water tank...

00:35.120 --> 00:39.400
to avoid the perils of
the summer sour grass...

00:39.440 --> 00:44.400
only for Swift to face another
challenge from her daughters.

01:36.880 --> 01:39.880
When a butterfly flutters
its wings,

01:39.920 --> 01:43.040
it is said to effect change
elsewhere.

01:46.560 --> 01:52.800
Small ripples become waves
with far-reaching consequences.

01:52.840 --> 01:58.000
This year's summer rains
have been frequent and intense,

01:58.040 --> 02:03.080
bringing with them
a storm of pregnancies...

02:03.120 --> 02:07.640
...which each family leader must
now deal with in her own way.

02:20.040 --> 02:24.080
A new day dawns over
Hakuna Matata territory.

02:26.680 --> 02:29.320
Following their recent
burrow drama,

02:29.360 --> 02:32.520
Flint's five pups
are growing in confidence

02:32.560 --> 02:34.680
in the great outdoors.

02:40.720 --> 02:45.680
But the rest of the family are
focussed on events below ground.

02:49.920 --> 02:53.360
There are even more
new arrivals.

02:57.280 --> 03:01.320
A slender-looking Munchkin
gave birth overnight.

03:04.880 --> 03:09.520
Her strenuous efforts to avoid
eviction have paid off.

03:11.960 --> 03:14.200
It's the first time
that her older sister

03:14.240 --> 03:17.920
has allowed anybody else
the privilege of breeding.

03:20.920 --> 03:23.680
It could just be lucky timing.

03:23.720 --> 03:25.480
There's more than enough food

03:25.520 --> 03:29.040
and for once,
Flint is not pregnant herself.

03:32.960 --> 03:35.440
The first 48 hours

03:35.480 --> 03:38.720
will be critical
for Munchkin's newborns.

03:40.520 --> 03:43.600
Deep inside the burrow,
they will need regular feeding.

03:45.400 --> 03:49.360
And she's also wet nursing
her older nieces and nephews.

03:53.200 --> 03:56.520
To produce that much milk,

03:56.560 --> 03:59.280
she must go
and feed with the group.

04:03.400 --> 04:08.160
Zahra is being left
in sole charge of both litters.

04:09.760 --> 04:12.160
She has excellent
babysitting skills,

04:12.200 --> 04:13.960
but is not lactating

04:15.680 --> 04:19.080
so the family had better not
be gone for too long.

04:27.280 --> 04:30.040
Further north,
along the dry riverbed,

04:30.080 --> 04:34.000
the Ubuntu are preparing
to do battle.

04:37.120 --> 04:40.280
But, just for once,
it's not with the neighbours.

04:43.160 --> 04:46.960
Daisy's gang is wrestling
with mother nature.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.440
Of all the territories
in the Manor,

04:52.480 --> 04:56.680
Ubuntu's riverbed home has seen
the most virulent growth

04:56.720 --> 04:59.120
of irritating sour grass.

05:05.400 --> 05:09.080
The acidic swathes
are so thick and tall here,

05:09.120 --> 05:12.960
that things are proceeding
at a snail's pace.

05:16.120 --> 05:20.600
Everybody is suffering
from the caustic sap.

05:20.640 --> 05:24.680
With the youngest family members
bearing the brunt.

05:24.720 --> 05:28.040
If Masukindt doesn't
beat the infection,

05:29.320 --> 05:30.920
she could lose her eye.

05:36.920 --> 05:42.840
Daisy boosted her army with
four pups born two months ago,

05:42.880 --> 05:44.960
but she's already
pregnant again.

05:48.880 --> 05:51.880
And she's not the only one.

05:51.920 --> 05:54.120
Eldest daughters
Magalee and Mamoof

05:54.160 --> 05:56.880
have clearly been caught out
by rovers.

06:01.400 --> 06:04.360
A pregnant matriarch
and two expectant subordinates

06:04.400 --> 06:07.440
surely spells trouble further
down the line...

06:10.040 --> 06:14.720
but the more immediate problem
is dealing with all this grass!

06:21.160 --> 06:23.480
Over at the Whiskers,

06:23.520 --> 06:27.560
Brea is keeping guard as Swift
and the rest of the family

06:27.600 --> 06:30.920
busy themselves
clearing out a bolt hole.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.960
They've left the safety of
their water tank burrow...

06:40.000 --> 06:43.560
... and now the old boy
seems on edge.

06:45.040 --> 06:46.680
Something in the distance,
perhaps?

06:49.320 --> 06:52.640
But if he's keeping his eye out
for roving males...

06:52.680 --> 06:56.440
that horse has already bolted.

06:56.480 --> 07:01.040
Daughter Laika has certainly
been entertaining a visitor.

07:03.880 --> 07:08.880
And by the looks of things,
so have Hachi ...and Fly.

07:11.160 --> 07:12.560
Holy Smoke!

07:12.600 --> 07:15.920
The girls were only
pups themselves a year ago.

07:16.920 --> 07:19.200
And there's more!

07:19.240 --> 07:22.200
Eldest daughters
Luna and Bel Hurricane

07:22.240 --> 07:24.680
have tell-tale bulges too.

07:25.840 --> 07:29.480
That's five pregnant daughters!

07:29.520 --> 07:33.320
It's like a Mommy and Me group!

07:33.360 --> 07:37.360
Ironically the only one
who isn't expecting is Swift!

07:42.120 --> 07:45.720
She seems unusually relaxed
about the situation.

07:45.760 --> 07:47.840
Positively relishing,
perhaps,

07:47.880 --> 07:49.960
the prospect of becoming
a grandmother.

07:51.960 --> 07:54.200
It could be that
she's happy to take a break

07:54.240 --> 07:57.560
and allow her daughters
to keep family numbers up.

07:57.600 --> 07:59.520
She's not getting any younger
afterall.

08:01.440 --> 08:06.000
Or maybe she just doesn't have
the energy for five evictions.

08:21.840 --> 08:24.240
After a busy morning foraging,

08:24.280 --> 08:27.920
Flint's family is enjoying
a siesta in the shade.

08:30.840 --> 08:33.600
But Munchkin...
can't relax.

08:38.520 --> 08:41.920
Her newborn pups,
at home with the babysitter,

08:41.960 --> 08:43.960
are due their next feed.

08:46.920 --> 08:49.240
She daren't leave on her own,

08:49.280 --> 08:52.080
and none of the others are
in any hurry to get home.

08:56.440 --> 08:59.680
But the new mum may be
about to receive some help

08:59.720 --> 09:01.760
in getting things moving...

09:03.560 --> 09:06.920
from someone who just loves
a wind-up.

09:25.040 --> 09:26.280
That woke them up!

09:29.000 --> 09:31.760
But there's still no sense of
urgency.

09:36.280 --> 09:37.320
Poor Munchkin.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.480
Flint finally gets everyone
moving again

09:41.520 --> 09:45.080
but not towards home.

09:45.120 --> 09:47.840
And there's nothing
Munchkin can do about it.

09:55.560 --> 09:57.160
Back along the riverbed,

09:57.200 --> 10:00.920
The Ubuntu are still imprisoned
in the sour grass.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.520
And the usual trick
for getting a better view -

10:09.560 --> 10:14.040
scrambling up bushes or fallen
logs - is just not cutting it.

10:16.360 --> 10:20.000
To see anything at all,
they need to get higher.

10:21.320 --> 10:23.000
Much higher.

10:25.880 --> 10:29.360
Fearlessness
is an Ubuntu family trait.

10:34.240 --> 10:36.880
Stan demonstrates how it's done.

10:47.920 --> 10:49.840
Not bad for a ground-dweller.

10:58.320 --> 11:03.000
Mr Worldwide and Stitch
take it a bit more cautiously.

11:15.080 --> 11:18.000
With only one good eye,

11:18.040 --> 11:21.400
Masukindt finds it difficult
to judge distance.

11:33.560 --> 11:38.440
It's not just the pups
struggling with arboreal life.

11:38.480 --> 11:43.080
Magalee's extra baby weight
makes defying gravity

11:43.120 --> 11:45.640
even more tricky.

11:45.680 --> 11:48.800
But the effort is worth it.

11:48.840 --> 11:53.840
Up top is a welcome break
from the misery of the grass.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.240
The only thing is...
what goes up...

11:57.600 --> 12:01.440
...must also come down.

12:35.720 --> 12:37.680
No harm done.

12:37.720 --> 12:39.840
With the kids now grounded,

12:39.880 --> 12:42.600
Daisy's family
are back to square one.

12:58.520 --> 13:03.280
On Swift's fertile patch,
the pregnant Whiskers girls

13:03.320 --> 13:07.440
are unearthing some of
the desert's tastiest treats.

13:15.360 --> 13:19.120
If she's quick, Laika could
satisfy a lizard craving

13:19.160 --> 13:21.000
before her brothers grab it.

13:23.680 --> 13:26.920
But today, they all lack
the killer instinct.

13:35.240 --> 13:37.320
The very rotund Bel Hurricane...

13:38.520 --> 13:40.520
...has no such qualms.

13:48.920 --> 13:51.640
She's not sharing with anyone...

13:51.680 --> 13:53.880
but her unborn pups.

13:56.120 --> 13:59.720
And certainly not
her younger pregnant sisters.

14:04.280 --> 14:07.920
It's unlikely that
all five subordinate litters,

14:07.960 --> 14:12.560
born into the same family
at the same time, will survive.

14:14.760 --> 14:17.920
Each mother-to-be
must protect her own.

14:21.240 --> 14:24.800
So, after polishing off
her first lizard,

14:24.840 --> 14:28.040
Bel Hurricane grabs herself
a second.

14:29.880 --> 14:32.840
And devours the reptile's eggs.

14:36.320 --> 14:39.840
Her sisters may not have
a moody matriarch to worry about

14:39.880 --> 14:41.920
but the young mums-to-be
should be wary

14:41.960 --> 14:44.680
of their ruthless older sister -

14:44.720 --> 14:48.040
heir apparent
to the Whiskers throne.

14:54.440 --> 14:57.480
As the afternoon showers
threaten to become a storm...

15:00.560 --> 15:05.560
...Swift hurries everyone
to the nearest bolt hole.

15:25.960 --> 15:29.040
The family prepares
to batten down the hatches.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.960
There's no telling
how long it will last.

15:37.520 --> 15:42.160
And the safest place to be
should be deep underground.

15:52.600 --> 15:55.200
A solitary figure remains.

15:57.480 --> 16:02.480
Mother-to-be Bel-Hurricane may
not have much longer to wait.

16:11.760 --> 16:17.840
As the heavens open,
they unleash a deluge.

16:17.880 --> 16:19.360
The Manor and beyond

16:19.400 --> 16:23.360
has seen unusually heavy rains
this season...

16:23.400 --> 16:27.720
...and this storm
lasts deep into the night.

16:44.520 --> 16:48.160
When dawn breaks,
calm has been restored.

16:52.360 --> 16:56.440
And in a far-flung corner
of Hakuna Matata territory,

16:56.480 --> 17:00.400
part of the family
is up exceptionally early.

17:09.320 --> 17:11.320
It's Flint...

17:11.360 --> 17:13.400
and her foraging group.

17:17.640 --> 17:21.440
Caught far from home by
the storm, they had no option

17:21.480 --> 17:25.320
but to shelter overnight
in this long-abandoned burrow.

17:27.520 --> 17:31.120
Everyone's safe, but they
desperately need to get home.

17:34.880 --> 17:40.560
Flint's and Munchkin's pups have
been without food for 24 hours.

17:44.120 --> 17:46.840
A frantic Munchkin
takes the lead

17:46.880 --> 17:49.960
as the family starts
their long journey home.

18:02.520 --> 18:04.480
Back at the burrow,

18:04.520 --> 18:09.240
babysitter Zahra
and Flint's pups are also up.

18:12.320 --> 18:16.840
Zahra is agitated and
the pups are desperately hungry.

18:19.120 --> 18:21.600
Where on earth is everyone?

18:42.920 --> 18:45.360
The pups are badly dehydrated.

18:46.560 --> 18:47.920
They need milk -

18:50.280 --> 18:52.880
but there's no chance of
anything from their big sister.

18:56.080 --> 18:59.840
Flint must come home...
soon.

19:12.200 --> 19:16.920
Underground, the situation
is even more desperate.

19:18.720 --> 19:21.240
Without any nourishment,

19:21.280 --> 19:25.840
Munchkin's tiny newborns
may not have survived the night.

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
A mile or so
to the east of the Manor...

19:34.040 --> 19:37.920
...a very different disaster
is unfolding.

19:49.160 --> 19:51.880
After weeks of intense
and sudden downpours

19:51.920 --> 19:53.880
throughout the area,

19:53.920 --> 19:57.200
the dry riverbed
has begun to fill.

20:00.520 --> 20:04.200
For the first time in 25 years.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.520
And now the flood waters
are heading

20:08.560 --> 20:12.320
with unstoppable force
towards the Manor.

20:36.240 --> 20:38.920
Unaware of
the approaching torrent,

20:40.360 --> 20:42.080
Flint and the rest of the family

20:42.120 --> 20:44.360
have travelled
the length of their territory

20:44.400 --> 20:46.920
in their desperate race home.

20:52.520 --> 20:55.480
Where Zahra is beside herself.

20:57.360 --> 21:00.200
She and the pups have
all but given up hope...

21:04.400 --> 21:06.080
until...

21:09.560 --> 21:11.280
...at last!

21:11.320 --> 21:12.840
Mum's home!

21:18.640 --> 21:20.880
Munchkin heads below ground,

21:20.920 --> 21:24.280
casting Flint's hungry pups
aside.

21:24.320 --> 21:27.640
She has only one concern.

21:43.760 --> 21:47.600
She emerges only moments later.

21:49.280 --> 21:52.120
And that can mean
only one thing.

21:54.640 --> 21:57.400
Her pups have not survived.

22:04.440 --> 22:07.920
The excitement of the family
reunion was short-lived.

22:15.120 --> 22:19.000
But there are still hungry
young mouths to feed.

22:21.880 --> 22:23.480
For the sake of the family,

22:23.520 --> 22:27.360
Munchkin dutifully puts her
personal tragedy behind her

22:27.400 --> 22:31.560
and tends to the needs
of her nieces and nephews.

22:41.720 --> 22:43.200
To the east...

22:46.560 --> 22:50.040
the flood waters
have reached the Manor.

22:53.320 --> 22:56.240
The dry riverbed is transformed.

22:58.640 --> 23:03.160
In some parts, the water
is more than 13 feet deep.

23:18.440 --> 23:24.320
The flood signals disaster
for Daisy and the Ubuntu.

23:27.200 --> 23:30.520
Their burrows are now
well below the waterline.

23:32.200 --> 23:36.520
And there's no sign...
of the family.
