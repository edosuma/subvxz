DOESN'T MAKE ME LOOK LIKE

12:05.295 --> 12:07.497
A PART OF
A FRENCH CIRCUS.

12:07.497 --> 12:09.459
THESE ARE AWESOME.

12:09.459 --> 12:14.164
LOOK, THEY COME IN MEN'S,
WOMEN'S AND JUNIOR MISSES.

12:14.164 --> 12:16.506
GUYS, HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO PULL THIS OFF?

12:16.506 --> 12:19.339
WE'VE NEVER HAD TO FIGHT
AGAINST BIONICS BEFORE.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.171
WE'RE NOT TRAINED FOR IT.

12:21.171 --> 12:23.343
I GUESS WE DO NEED
MR. DAVENPORT.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.215
I GOT THIS.

12:25.215 --> 12:27.878
I CAN'T TRAIN YOU,
BUT I CAN GUIDE YOU.

12:27.878 --> 12:30.120
I'VE BEEN IN THAT LAIR,
SO I CAN HELP YOU NAVIGATE

12:30.120 --> 12:31.151
ON THE COM SET.

12:31.151 --> 12:32.352
GOOD CALL.

12:32.352 --> 12:35.225
OKAY, GUYS.
YOU READY TO DO THIS?

12:35.225 --> 12:36.887
ABSOLUTELY.
 BRING IT!

12:36.887 --> 12:38.258
THEN LET'S GO GET
OUT DAD BACK.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.190
All:
YEAH! YEAH!

12:41.932 --> 12:44.194
I'M SORRY. I JUST GOT
CAUGHT UP IN THE MOMENT.

12:49.499 --> 12:51.371
YOU KNOW YOU'RE NEVER
GONNA GET AWAY WITH THIS.

12:51.371 --> 12:52.943
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID

12:52.943 --> 12:54.774
WHEN I STOLE 20 BUCKS
FROM DAD'S WALLET.

12:54.774 --> 12:58.008
AND GUESS WHAT?
I GOT AWAY WITH IT. BOOM.

12:58.008 --> 13:01.351
OH, NO, NO, NO.
YOU DO NOT GO BOOM.

13:01.351 --> 13:05.385
I GO BOOM.
THAT'S MY THING. BOOM!

13:07.357 --> 13:09.289
WELL, I GUESS
I STOLE THAT TOO.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.491
JUST LIKE YOU STOLE
ADAM, BREE, AND CHASE.

13:11.491 --> 13:15.195
I DID NOT STEAL THEM
I WAS PROTECTING THEM FROM YOU.

13:15.195 --> 13:18.869
I FOUND A WAY TO USE
OUR BIONIC TECHNOLOGY IN HUMANS,

13:18.869 --> 13:21.331
AND YOU RIPPED
IT RIGHT OUT OF MY HANDS.

13:21.331 --> 13:23.203
YOU WERE GONNA MAKE
BIONIC SOLDIERS

13:23.203 --> 13:25.305
AND RENT THEM OUT
TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER.

13:25.305 --> 13:28.278
YOU WERE GONNA USE KIDS
FOR EVIL PURPOSES.

13:28.278 --> 13:33.013
YOU SAY THAT'S LIKE
IT'S A BAD THING.

13:33.013 --> 13:36.917
JUST TRYING TO MEET
THE NEEDS OF MY CUSTOMERS.

13:36.917 --> 13:40.921
IT'S NOT MY FAULT THEY'RE ALL
DICTATORS AND MADMEN.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.422
( computer blips )

13:42.422 --> 13:45.325
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
WE'VE GOT COMPANY.

13:47.257 --> 13:50.000
TRUST ME,
THEY WILL DEFEAT YOU.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.964
OOOH. I'M SO SCARED.

13:53.964 --> 13:56.336
YOU FORGET I HAVE A BIONIC
WEAPON OF MY OWN,

13:56.336 --> 13:58.238
MARCUS!

14:00.210 --> 14:01.311
IS IT TIME?

14:01.311 --> 14:11.982
IT IS. GO WELCOME
OUR GUESTS.

14:11.982 --> 14:14.084
BOOM.

14:14.084 --> 14:21.261
YOU DON'T EVEN DO IT RIGHT.

14:21.261 --> 14:23.233
TRUST ME,
THIS IS THE HOUSE.

14:23.233 --> 14:24.464
ARE YOU SURE?

14:24.464 --> 14:26.566
I DON'T HEAR MR. DAVENPORT
CRYING LIKE A BABY.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.499
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO GET INSIDE

14:29.499 --> 14:31.371
IF THERE'S NOT
EVEN A DOOR?

14:31.371 --> 14:33.303
I KNOW! LET'S ORDER A PIZZA
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

14:33.303 --> 14:35.305
ADAM, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

14:35.305 --> 14:37.047
OKAY, IT'S DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE PIZZA.

14:37.047 --> 14:39.179
CAN BE CHINESE, MEXICAN,
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.582
Leo:
GUYS, FOCUS.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.414
YOU NEED TO LOOK
FOR A WAY TO GET INSIDE.

14:44.414 --> 14:46.516
ONCE YOU'RE IN,
I CAN TELL YOU WHERE TO GO.

14:46.516 --> 14:48.989
I GOT THIS.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.525
OPEN SESAME!

14:55.525 --> 14:57.367
ADAM...

14:57.367 --> 14:59.369
( whirring )

15:02.372 --> 15:05.275
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.

15:05.275 --> 15:08.408
YOUR HIDDEN ABILITY IS
TALKING TO VINYL SIDINGS.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.380
WELL, WELL, WELL.

15:10.380 --> 15:12.212
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

15:12.212 --> 15:15.946
I SHOULD WARN YOU.
I CAN CONTROL VINYL SIDING.

15:17.247 --> 15:19.219
WHERE'S MR. DAVENPORT?

15:19.219 --> 15:23.493
OH, THE LITTLE BIONIC
BABIES MISS THEIR DADDY?

15:23.493 --> 15:26.126
WHY WOULD YOU
DO THIS, MARCUS?

15:26.126 --> 15:27.357
WE THOUGHT YOU
WERE OUR FRIEND.

15:27.357 --> 15:31.601
OH, YOU FELL FOR THAT ONE.
HOOK, LINE, AND SINKER.

15:31.601 --> 15:35.105
WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT
THE PATHETIC LITTLE LEO

15:35.105 --> 15:36.436
WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG.

15:36.436 --> 15:40.170
THANK YOU.
HEY!

15:40.170 --> 15:43.243
THE BEST PART OF ALL,

15:43.243 --> 15:46.946
IS THAT NONE OF YOU
HAD A CLUE THAT
I'M JUST LIKE YOU.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.979
HALF-IRISH?

15:48.979 --> 15:52.282
BIONIC. I'M BIONIC.

15:54.154 --> 15:57.257
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA TAKE
US TO MR. DAVENPORT.

15:58.358 --> 16:01.061
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO MOVE FASTER THAN THAT.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.962
LET'S SEE HOW
YOU HANDLE THIS.

16:07.297 --> 16:09.639
NO!

16:09.639 --> 16:12.272
YOU WANNA GIVE IT A SHOT?

16:12.272 --> 16:15.245
THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER ASK.

16:28.318 --> 16:32.022
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU COULD DO THAT.

16:32.022 --> 16:34.164
ANOTHER HIDDEN ABILITY
I DISCOVERED.

16:34.164 --> 16:37.097
I WAS JUST IN THE SHOWER
ONE DAY AND THERE IT WAS.

16:37.097 --> 16:38.498
OH, MAN.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.401
ALL I GET IN THE SHOWER
IS PRUNY FINGERS.

16:41.401 --> 16:43.703
GUYS, COME ON. GO.

16:50.540 --> 16:52.242
HOOK, LINE, AND SINKER.

16:54.414 --> 16:57.717
GUYS, GUYS.
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

16:57.717 --> 17:01.391
CHASE? COME IN.
UGH.

17:01.391 --> 17:03.353
( whirring )

17:03.353 --> 17:05.755
EDDIE, YOU'RE BACK!

17:05.755 --> 17:08.458
WHOA. WHAT HAPPENED?

17:08.458 --> 17:12.801
AND WHO ENABLED
MY COOKIES?

17:12.801 --> 17:15.435
LONG STORY,
BIG D GOT CAPTURED,

17:15.435 --> 17:17.537
ADAM, BREE, AND CHASE
WENT TO RESCUE HIM.

17:17.537 --> 17:20.440
WHAT? IF ANYTHING
HAPPENS TO MY DONNY,

17:20.440 --> 17:22.372
WHAT DO YOU SAY YOU
AND I HIT THE ROAD

17:22.372 --> 17:26.146
AND BLOW THE BANKROLL
ON ITALIAN SUITS AND FAST CARS?

17:27.477 --> 17:29.549
THEY'RE AT MARCUS'S HOUSE.

17:29.549 --> 17:32.222
I LAST CONTACTED THEM
WHEN THEY WENT INSIDE.

17:32.222 --> 17:37.127
WAIT. HOW WAS MARCUS ABLE
TO SHOW UP ON YOUR SCREEN?

17:37.127 --> 17:40.059
I DON'T KNOW. HE MUST'VE
HACKED INTO MY NETWORK.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.292
IT FEELS SO VIOLATED.

17:42.292 --> 17:45.665
THAT'S IT. MARCUS
AND WHOEVER HE'S WORKING FOR

17:45.665 --> 17:47.367
HAVE BEEN SPYING.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.399
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE ALWAYS
ONE STEP AHEAD OF US.

17:49.399 --> 17:51.401
IT REALLY DOESN'T
TAKE THAT MUCH.

17:53.573 --> 17:58.348
CAN YOU RESERVE THE RELAY SIGNAL
AND PUT IT UP ON THE MONITOR?

17:58.348 --> 18:04.214
CAN YOU NOT TALK TO ME
LIKE I'M A THREE YEAR OLD?

18:04.214 --> 18:06.356
OKAY, OKAY.

18:06.356 --> 18:08.087
( static )

18:08.087 --> 18:10.260
OW!

18:11.461 --> 18:14.824
NOW WE CAN SEE THEM
AND THEY CAN'T SEE US.

18:14.824 --> 18:16.296
BAM!

18:16.296 --> 18:20.330
YOU KNOW WHAT,
WE MAKE A GREAT TEAM.

18:20.330 --> 18:21.671
THANKS, EDDIE.

18:21.671 --> 18:24.774
AND BY THE WAY,
I WANT OFF THE TEAM.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.280
( futuristic jazz plays )

18:30.280 --> 18:33.813
FOR AN UNSTABLE SOCIOPATH,

18:33.813 --> 18:36.616
YOU'RE TASTE IN MUSIC
COULD BE A LOT BETTER.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.218
( shuts off music )

18:38.218 --> 18:39.619
YOU WERE IN A BOY BAND.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.521
IT WAS NOT A BOY BAND.

18:41.521 --> 18:43.253
IT WAS AN A CAPPELLA GROUP

18:43.253 --> 18:46.726
THAT JUST HAPPENED TO BE
MADE UP OF BOYS.

18:48.228 --> 18:49.659
MR. DAVENPORT!

18:49.659 --> 18:52.532
OH, GOODY.
EVERYONE'S HERE.

18:52.532 --> 18:54.364
PARTY TIME!

18:56.135 --> 18:57.437
I'VE SECURED THE PERIMETER.

18:57.437 --> 18:59.409
THEY'RE OURS NOW.

18:59.409 --> 19:02.342
MR. DAVENPORT,
WHAT IS GOING ON?

19:02.342 --> 19:03.473
WHO IS THIS GUY?

19:03.473 --> 19:05.515
WHO IS THIS GUY?

19:05.515 --> 19:09.419
DONNY, YOU NEVER
TOLD THEM ABOUT ME?

19:09.419 --> 19:10.480
I'M DEEPLY OFFENDED.

19:10.480 --> 19:15.755
ADAM, BREE, CHASE...

19:15.755 --> 19:18.358
I'M YOUR FATHER.

19:18.358 --> 19:21.531
♪ ♪

19:32.202 --> 19:35.174
( no audible dialogue )

19:35.174 --> 19:38.208
I'M SO CONFUSED!

19:38.208 --> 19:41.581
HOW ARE YOU NOT FOLLOWING THIS?
YOU'RE A COMPUTER.

19:41.581 --> 19:43.613
SO, MARCUS IS BIONIC.

19:43.613 --> 19:44.714
YES.

19:44.714 --> 19:46.356
AND DOUGLAS
IS MARCUS'S FATHER.

19:46.356 --> 19:47.917
YES.

19:47.917 --> 19:49.919
AND NOW HE SAYS HE'S ADAM,
BREE, AND CHASE'S FATHER.

19:49.919 --> 19:51.561
YES.

19:51.561 --> 19:52.962
BUT HE'S ALSO
DONALD'S BROTHER.

19:52.962 --> 19:54.564
YES!

19:54.564 --> 19:57.196
WOW. SO THERE'S
ANOTHER DAVENPORT?

19:57.196 --> 19:58.768
AND HE'S EVIL?

19:58.768 --> 20:01.231
ASK HIM IF HE'S HIRING.

20:04.604 --> 20:05.935
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU'RE OUR FATHER?

20:05.935 --> 20:07.437
YEAH, HE IS OUR FATHER.

20:07.437 --> 20:10.480
NO, THAT'S WHAT HE'S
BEEN TELLING YOU.

20:10.480 --> 20:12.512
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE,
BUT YOU'RE GOING DOWN.

20:15.645 --> 20:19.249
YOU MASTERED SHORT-RANGE
TELEPORTATION BEFORE I DID?

20:19.249 --> 20:21.220
I'VE BEEN WORKING
ON THAT FOR YEARS!

20:21.220 --> 20:25.825
I KNOW. I'M AWESOME.

20:25.825 --> 20:27.927
NO, YOU'RE NOT AWESOME,
I'M AWESOME.

20:27.927 --> 20:29.899
- I'M AWESOME.
- AWESOME!

20:30.900 --> 20:35.265
YOU'RE STILL
GOING DOWN.

20:35.265 --> 20:39.739
MY SUPER STRENGTH.
IT'S GONE.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.272
SO IS MY SPEED.

20:42.272 --> 20:44.274
I'VE GOT NOTHING.

20:44.274 --> 20:46.346
THAT'S BECAUSE
I DESIGNED THESE LASERS

20:46.346 --> 20:49.849
TO BLOCK THE SIGNALS
FROM YOUR BIONIC CHIPS.

20:49.849 --> 20:52.652
THAT'S RIGHT.
DADDY GAVE YOU TOYS,

20:52.652 --> 20:54.984
BUT HE CAN ALSO
TAKE THEM AWAY.

20:56.726 --> 21:00.830
YEAH, IN HERE YOU'RE
NOT SUPER HUMAN.

21:00.830 --> 21:02.592
YOU'RE JUST A BUNCH
OF PATHETIC KIDS.

21:02.592 --> 21:05.635
HEY, SAD CLOWN.
THIS IS MY MOMENT.

21:05.635 --> 21:07.937
SAVE IT FOR THE STAGE.

21:11.601 --> 21:14.043
EDDIE, THEY'RE TRAPPED.
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

21:14.043 --> 21:15.805
WELL, IF I KNOW YOU,

21:15.805 --> 21:18.308
I'M SURE IT'LL INVOLVE
A SAD LITTLE PLAN

21:18.308 --> 21:21.050
AND AN EPIC FAIL.
GOOD LUCK.

21:21.050 --> 21:23.913
THIS IS SERIOUS!

21:23.913 --> 21:25.955
WELL, HOW DO YOU
THINK I FEEL?

21:25.955 --> 21:27.517
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO THEM,

21:27.517 --> 21:29.889
I'M STUCK HERE
FOREVER WITH YOU AND TASHA.

21:31.691 --> 21:34.964
NOT EVEN COMPUTERS ARE MEANT
TO SUFFER THAT MUCH.

21:34.964 --> 21:37.897
ALL RIGHT, IF I GO
TO THE AUTHORITIES,

21:37.897 --> 21:41.431
I'LL BLOW THEIR
BIONIC SECRET.

21:41.431 --> 21:44.674
I'M JUST GONNA HAVE TO GO THERE
AND RESCUE THEM MYSELF.

21:44.674 --> 21:47.036
( cackles )

21:48.578 --> 21:51.481
OH, YOU'RE SERIOUS.

21:51.481 --> 21:52.982
YES.

21:52.982 --> 21:55.845
BUT I WON'T STAND A
CHANCE AGAINST MARCUS'S BIONICS

21:55.845 --> 21:57.917
IF I GO THERE EMPTY HANDED.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.549
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO.

21:59.549 --> 22:00.920
WHAT?

22:00.920 --> 22:03.593
DONALD TOLD ME THAT
IN A WORST CASE SCENARIO,

22:03.593 --> 22:06.356
SOMEONE HAS
TO PUSH THIS BUTTON.

22:06.356 --> 22:09.959
AND YOU BEING THE ONLY ONE LEFT
IS THE WORST CASE SCENARIO.

22:13.403 --> 22:16.736
( beeping, whirring )

22:16.736 --> 22:20.039
WHOA. IT'S A HOLOGRAM.

22:20.039 --> 22:23.543
ADAM, BREE, CHASE,

22:23.543 --> 22:26.976
IF YOU'RE WATCHING THIS,
SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAS HAPPENED.

22:30.980 --> 22:32.982
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO BECOME THE HEROES

22:32.982 --> 22:34.954
YOU WERE ALWAYS MEANT TO BE.

22:34.954 --> 22:36.786
AND WHATEVER IT IS
YOU'RE ABOUT TO FACE,

22:36.786 --> 22:38.928
I KNOW YOU CAN
HANDLE IT WITHOUT ME.

22:38.928 --> 22:43.493
( singsong )
IT'S NOT WHAT HE
TOLD THEM YESTERDAY.

22:43.493 --> 22:45.795
THOUGH YOUR BIONICS
ARE AMAZING,

22:45.795 --> 22:47.497
THEY MAY NOT ALWAYS
BE ENOUGH.

22:47.497 --> 22:49.699
SO STEP INTO THE ELEVATOR,
AND EDDIE WILL TAKE YOU

22:49.699 --> 22:53.903
TO A SECRET FLOOR BELOW THE LAB:
MY WEAPONS VAULT.

22:53.903 --> 22:58.448
HE HAS A SECRET
WEAPONS VAULT?

22:58.448 --> 23:00.450
AND LEO,
IF YOU ARE WATCHING THIS,

23:00.450 --> 23:03.382
I DO NOT HAVE
A SECRET WEAPONS VAULT!

23:10.019 --> 23:14.764
WHOA. LOOK AT ALL THIS.

23:14.764 --> 23:18.468
Eddie:
A ROOM FULL OF STUFF
YOU CAN USE TO HURT YOURSELF.

23:18.468 --> 23:21.400
I SHOULD'VE SHOWED
YOU THIS A LONG TIME AGO.

23:23.072 --> 23:25.004
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO USE IT

23:25.004 --> 23:26.436
IF I DON'T KNOW
HOW IT WORKS?

23:26.436 --> 23:29.108
WHEN HAS THAT EVER
STOPPED YOU BEFORE?

23:29.108 --> 23:31.841
GOOD POINT.
LET'S DO THIS.

23:33.483 --> 23:35.084
OOH! THAT'S GOOD ONE!

23:35.084 --> 23:38.618
HERE'S A HINT.
AIM IT AWAY FROM YOURSELF.

23:43.092 --> 23:46.596
( groans, yells )

23:46.596 --> 23:47.827
OW!

23:47.827 --> 23:50.029
YEP, EVERY GREAT JOURNEY

23:50.029 --> 23:53.162
STARTS WITH A SINGLE STEP
AND A FACE PLANT.

23:58.868 --> 24:02.011
WELL, MARCUS.
WE FINALLY
CAPTURED THEM.

24:02.011 --> 24:05.945
ACTUALLY, I CAPTURED THEM.
ME, ME, ME, ME, ME.

24:07.817 --> 24:09.148
YOU'VE GOT ONE
OF THOSE TOO, HUH?

24:09.148 --> 24:11.881
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

24:11.881 --> 24:13.523
COME ON.
( snaps fingers )

24:13.523 --> 24:15.685
WE GOT WORK TO DO.

24:19.629 --> 24:21.060
MR. DAVENPORT,

24:21.060 --> 24:24.163
WHY DID THAT GUY SAY
THAT HE WAS OUR FATHER?

24:24.163 --> 24:28.768
BECAUSE, TECHNICALLY,
HE IS YOUR FATHER.

24:28.768 --> 24:30.469
AND MY BROTHER.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.972
WHAT?

24:32.972 --> 24:34.574
HOW IS THAT
EVEN POSSIBLE?

24:34.574 --> 24:37.677
WAIT, SO DOES THIS MEAN
CHASE IS ALSO MY FATHER?

24:39.749 --> 24:43.252
YEARS AGO, DOUGLAS AND I STARTED
DAVENPORT INDUSTRIES TOGETHER.

24:43.252 --> 24:47.016
IT WAS GREAT.
WE HAD A CUTE, LITTLE LAB.

24:47.016 --> 24:48.818
NOT AS GOOD AS THE BIG LAB
I HAVE NOW,

24:48.818 --> 24:49.989
BUT THEN WE DIDN'T NEARLY
HAVE AS MUCH MONEY--

24:49.989 --> 24:51.220
GET TO THE POINT.

24:51.220 --> 24:52.792
RIGHT.

24:52.792 --> 24:54.994
WE DEVELOPED BIONICS
SO THAT ROBOTS

24:54.994 --> 24:57.196
COULD DO THE JOBS THAT WERE
TOO DANGEROUS FOR PEOPLE.

24:57.196 --> 25:00.069
BUT THEN, DOUGLAS WENT BEHIND MY
BACK AND IMPLANTED THEM

25:00.069 --> 25:02.171
INTO GENETICALLY
ENGINEERED HUMANS.

25:02.171 --> 25:04.874
YOU MEAN US?

25:04.874 --> 25:08.538
NO, ADAM.
THE GREEN BAY PACKERS.

25:08.538 --> 25:11.210
YOUR BIONIC CHIPS
WERE NEVER DESIGNED

25:11.210 --> 25:13.813
TO BE INTERFACED WITH
THE HUMAN NERVOUS SYSTEM.

25:13.813 --> 25:15.615
SO THAT'S WHY WE GLITCH.

25:15.615 --> 25:16.816
EXACTLY.

25:16.816 --> 25:19.118
OH. AND ALL THESE YEARS

25:19.118 --> 25:22.021
I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS 'CAUSE
YOU'RE A TERRIBLE SCIENTIST.

25:22.021 --> 25:27.126
DOUGLAS ALSO HID ALL KINDS OF
SECRET CODES IN YOUR CHIPS.

25:27.126 --> 25:29.158
THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE ALL THESE
MYSTERIOUS NEW ABILITIES

25:29.158 --> 25:30.900
POPPING UP OUT OF NOWHERE.

25:30.900 --> 25:34.033
SO, IF YOUR
BROTHER CREATED US,

25:34.033 --> 25:36.135
HOW DID WE END
UP WITH YOU?

25:36.135 --> 25:39.709
HE WANTED TO MAKE YOU
INTO CYBER-SOLDIERS
OF MASS DESTRUCTION.

25:39.709 --> 25:42.311
BUT I KNEW THAT IF I RAISED YOU
IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT,

25:42.311 --> 25:44.213
I COULD TRAIN YOU
TO BE BIONIC HEROES.

25:44.213 --> 25:47.617
SO I BUILT THE LAB
AND I HID YOU THERE.

25:47.617 --> 25:51.851
WOW. SO EVERYTHING WE'VE EVER
KNOWN ABOUT OURSELVES,

25:51.851 --> 25:54.023
ABOUT YOU,

25:54.023 --> 25:55.655
IT'S ALL BEEN...
 ONE BIG LIE.

25:55.655 --> 25:59.959
WOW. THIS CHANGES
EVERYTHING.

25:59.959 --> 26:02.061
OH! AM I JEWISH?

26:03.733 --> 26:06.065
PLEASE TELL ME THERE'S ANOTHER
UNEXPECTED TWIST

26:06.065 --> 26:07.997
TO WHERE I FIND OUT
THAT I'M NOT RELATED TO HIM.

26:09.268 --> 26:13.903
OI, THIS ONE WITH THE
FUTZING AND THE COMPLAINING.

26:15.074 --> 26:18.007
LOOK, I WANTED TO TELL
YOU GUYS, BUT I FIGURED

26:18.007 --> 26:20.880
THE LESS YOU KNEW,
THE SAFER YOU'D BE.

26:20.880 --> 26:23.112
BUT WE TRUSTED YOU.

26:23.112 --> 26:24.283
IF YOU WERE LYING ABOUT THIS

26:24.283 --> 26:26.115
THEN WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE
YOU WERE LYING ABOUT.

26:26.115 --> 26:27.356
EXACTLY.

26:27.356 --> 26:28.988
OW! WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

26:28.988 --> 26:33.362
HE'S NOT LYING ABOUT THE HAIR,
JUST LOOKS FAKE.

26:35.695 --> 26:38.267
♪ ♪

26:38.267 --> 26:40.830
( wagon wheels squeaking )

26:40.830 --> 26:43.102
Eddie:
LOOK OUT, BAD GUYS.

26:43.102 --> 26:47.236
OUR BRAVE HERO HAS ARRIVED,
TOWING HIS POWERFUL WEAPONS

26:47.236 --> 26:50.039
IN HIS LITTLE RED WAGON.

26:50.039 --> 26:51.641
IT WAS EITHER THIS,

26:51.641 --> 26:53.012
OR MY MOM'S LEOPARD-PRINT
ROLLER BAG.

26:53.012 --> 26:57.086
I MADE A CHOICE,
LIVE WITH IT.

26:57.086 --> 26:59.789
Eddie:
HOW ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO GET INSIDE?

26:59.789 --> 27:04.053
THERE'S A HIDDEN ENTRYWAY
SOMEWHERE BEHIND THIS WALL.

27:04.053 --> 27:05.825
Eddie:
NO PROBLEMO.

27:05.825 --> 27:07.226
I HAVE A THERMAL SCANNER

27:07.226 --> 27:10.099
THAT CAN DETECT ANOMALIES
IN THE WALL'S INNER STRUCTURE.

27:10.099 --> 27:11.200
YOU DO?

27:11.200 --> 27:13.102
OF COURSE NOT.

27:13.102 --> 27:15.935
I'M INSIDE A WATCH FROM
AN AIRPLANE CATALOGUE.

27:15.935 --> 27:18.107
CAN EVEN TAKE ME OUT
IN THE RAIN.

27:18.107 --> 27:21.671
( Eddie beeping )
OUCH!

27:22.972 --> 27:24.974
HELLO, FAMILY.

27:24.974 --> 27:27.016
WE'RE NOT YOUR FAMILY.
LET US OUT OF HERE.

27:27.016 --> 27:30.850
YEAH. YOU CAN'T FORCE US
TOP BE YOUR CYBER-SOLDIERS.

27:30.850 --> 27:35.184
ACTUALLY, I CAN,
BOY WONDER.

27:35.184 --> 27:36.856
SEE, WHEN I CREATED YOU,

27:36.856 --> 27:39.058
IO INSTALLED MY TRITON APP
ON YOUR CHIPS.

27:39.058 --> 27:41.360
ONCE IT'S ACTIVATED,
I'LL CONTROL YOUR BODIES,

27:41.360 --> 27:43.062
AND YOUR MINDS.

27:43.062 --> 27:44.033
YOU'LL DO WHATEVER I WANT.

27:44.033 --> 27:46.135
WHETHER IT'S START
A WORLD WAR,

27:46.135 --> 27:47.997
OR SOME LIGHT
HOUSEKEEPING.

27:47.997 --> 27:51.270
OH, NO WAY.
YOU CANNOT MAKE ME VACUUM!

27:51.270 --> 27:53.773
WHY DO YOU NEED US?

27:53.773 --> 27:55.404
YOU ALREADY HAVE MARCUS,

27:55.404 --> 27:58.247
AND APPARENTLY A BARBER
WITH A SENSE OF HUMOR.

28:00.209 --> 28:03.282
MARCUS IS JUST AN ANDROID.

28:03.282 --> 28:06.115
HE'S NOT SLEEPING,

28:06.115 --> 28:07.817
HE'S RECHARGING.

28:10.059 --> 28:13.823
TROUBLE WITH ANDROIDS IS
THEY BURN OUT TOO QUICK.

28:13.823 --> 28:16.325
HE WON'T MAKE IT
TO HIS 16th BIRTHDAY.

28:16.325 --> 28:19.729
BUT DON'T TELL HIM THAT.
HE THINKS HE'S GETTING A CAR.

28:21.430 --> 28:23.002
( computer blips )

28:23.002 --> 28:26.936
OH, LOOK WHO SHOWED UP
TO BE A HERO.

28:26.936 --> 28:30.039
( laughs )
AND THIS ONE'S
NOT EVEN BIONIC.

28:30.039 --> 28:32.041
I CAN TAKE HIM OUT
WITH THE SPRINKLERS.

28:32.041 --> 28:34.313
LEAVE HIM ALONE.
HE'S JUST A KID.

28:34.313 --> 28:36.485
A NOSY KID WHO KEEPS
GETTING IN OUR WAY.

28:36.485 --> 28:38.117
STAY AWAY FROM HIM.

28:38.117 --> 28:40.850
DON'T WORRY, PRINCESS.

28:40.850 --> 28:43.392
I'M NOT GONNA HURT HIM.

28:47.356 --> 28:51.160
MARCUS WANTED THAT PRIVILEGE
ALL TO HIMSELF.

28:51.160 --> 28:54.263
YOUR LITTLE FRIEND
LEO IS BACK.

28:54.263 --> 28:57.967
THIS TIME,
TAKE CARE OF HIM FOR GOOD.

28:57.967 --> 28:59.939
DONE.

29:04.944 --> 29:06.315
REALLY, DUDE?

29:06.315 --> 29:10.019
YOU'RE JUST GONNA LEAVE YOUR
CREATOR HANGING LIKE THAT?

29:12.181 --> 29:14.483
THERE'S GOTTA BE SOME SORT
OF TRIGGER MECHANISM

29:14.483 --> 29:16.956
TO MAKE THE HIDDEN
ENTRYWAY APPEAR.

29:16.956 --> 29:20.159
Eddie:
WHY DON'T YOU TRY BANGING YOUR
LITTLE WAGON UP AGAINST IT?

29:20.159 --> 29:22.191
ENOUGH WITH THE WAGON.

29:22.191 --> 29:23.392
( whirring )

29:23.392 --> 29:25.194
HELLO, LEO.

29:25.194 --> 29:27.166
( loud scream )

29:27.166 --> 29:28.998
SORRY YOU CAME
ALL THIS WAY,

29:28.998 --> 29:31.300
BUT WE'RE KIND OF BUSY.

29:31.300 --> 29:33.973
AND FRANKLY,
I'VE HAD IT WITH YOU.

29:33.973 --> 29:37.376
OH, YEAH?
WELL I'VE GOT THIS.

29:37.376 --> 29:40.509
( loud whirring )

29:40.509 --> 29:43.252
NO, YOU HAD THAT.

29:43.252 --> 29:46.856
OH, YEAH? WELL,
I STILL GOT ALL OF THESE.

29:46.856 --> 29:49.258
( whirring )

29:49.258 --> 29:52.061
NO!

29:52.061 --> 29:57.396
GOODBYES ARE TOUGH, LEO,
SO I'LL MAKE THIS EASY.

29:57.396 --> 29:59.068
( electricity crackles )

29:59.068 --> 30:01.200
All:
NO!

30:09.378 --> 30:12.241
POOR LEO.

30:12.241 --> 30:14.113
HE WAS TRYING TO SAVE US.

30:14.113 --> 30:19.088
HE TRIED TO WARN US ABOUT
MARCUS AND WE IGNORED HIM.

30:19.088 --> 30:21.490
WHEN I GET OUT OF HERE,
I'M TAKING YOU AND MARCUS DOWN.

30:21.490 --> 30:23.092
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

30:23.092 --> 30:25.995
ONCE I PRESS THIS,
IT'LL ACTIVATE YOUR TRITON APPS,

30:25.995 --> 30:28.397
THEN I'LL CONTROL YOU.
PERMANENTLY.

30:28.397 --> 30:31.830
NO!
 STOP!
 DO CHASE FIRST!

30:31.830 --> 30:33.532
( grunts )

30:33.532 --> 30:34.563
( all grunt )

30:36.265 --> 30:38.467
( all grunt )

30:38.467 --> 30:42.511
MARCUS, DID YOU PUT
BATTERIES IN THIS THING?

30:42.511 --> 30:44.213
HA!

30:44.213 --> 30:45.444
( laughs )

30:45.444 --> 30:46.615
I WENT INTO THEIR CHIPS

30:46.615 --> 30:49.348
AND PUT A BLOCK ON YOUR
APP A LONG TIME AGO.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.480
OOH, IT IS SO GOOD
WATCHING YOU EAT IT.

30:51.480 --> 30:53.322
( hums )

30:53.322 --> 30:55.354
OW!

30:55.354 --> 30:58.387
VERY CLEVER, DONNY.

30:58.387 --> 30:59.628
BUT I'LL GET AROUND IT.

30:59.628 --> 31:02.391
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A BETTER
PROGRAMMER THAN YOU.

31:02.391 --> 31:04.263
THERE, SEE?

31:04.263 --> 31:05.935
ONLY EIGHT MINUTES
TILL MY CYPHER KEY

31:05.935 --> 31:08.497
DECRYPTS YOUR BLOCK
AND ACTIVATES THE TRITON APP.

31:09.498 --> 31:12.401
WHAT'RE YOU GONNA DO?
CALL MOMMY?

31:12.401 --> 31:15.574
IF YOU DO,
DON'T TELL HER I'M ALIVE.

31:17.146 --> 31:21.380
Eddie: OH, LEO! WHY?

31:21.380 --> 31:23.552
WHY?

31:23.552 --> 31:28.387
WHY DIDN'T YOU LEAVE
ME AT HOME?

31:28.387 --> 31:31.490
( gasps, coughs )

31:31.490 --> 31:33.422
AAAAH! HE'S A ZOMBIE!

31:33.422 --> 31:35.264
I'M NOT A ZOMBIE.

31:35.264 --> 31:38.427
AAAH! HE DOESN'T KNOW
HE'S A ZOMBIE!

31:38.427 --> 31:43.232
LUCKILY, ONE OF BIG D's
PROTECTED VESTS SAVED ME.

31:43.232 --> 31:46.575
WE HAVE TO RESCUE THEM.

31:46.575 --> 31:48.407
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
LEFT TO DO.

31:48.407 --> 31:51.580
Eddie:
GIVE UP AND WALK AWAY?
GOOD PLAN.

31:51.580 --> 31:53.542
OW!

31:53.542 --> 31:56.515
GREAT. YOU WALK AROUND
THE BLOCK AND COOL OFF.

31:56.515 --> 31:57.686
I'LL WAIT HERE.

31:59.418 --> 32:01.520
( computer chirps )

32:01.520 --> 32:03.422
GUYS, THERE'S ONLY FOUR
MINUTES LEFT

32:03.422 --> 32:04.523
UNTIL THE BLOCK
IS DECRYPTED.

32:04.523 --> 32:06.595
WE HAVE TO GET
OUT OF HERE.

32:06.595 --> 32:09.128
IF WE COULD FIND A WAY TO
DEFLECT ONE OF THESE BEAMS,

32:09.128 --> 32:11.000
WE COULD TAKE OUT
THE CONTROL CONSOLE

32:11.000 --> 32:13.402
AND DEACTIVATE
THE LASER SOURCE.

32:13.402 --> 32:16.305
I DON'T SUPPOSE ANYBODY
HAS A MIRROR ON THEM.

32:16.305 --> 32:19.238
IF ANY OF US HAD A MIRROR
ON THEM, IT'D BE YOU.

32:21.010 --> 32:23.442
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
WE CAN USE.

32:23.442 --> 32:25.314
WELL, I CAN'T THINK
ON AN EMPTY STOMACH.

32:28.717 --> 32:30.519
YOU BROUGHT
A GRANOLA BAR?

32:30.519 --> 32:33.482
YUP. THANKS FOR TAKING MY
SUGGESTION ON THE SNACK HOLDER.

32:33.482 --> 32:36.525
THAT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE FOR A WEAPON.

32:36.525 --> 32:40.329
OI, THIS ONE
WITH THE WEAPONS.

32:40.329 --> 32:44.233
HEY, WE CAN USE THIS
AS A REFLECTIVE SURFACE.

32:44.233 --> 32:48.097
YES, BUT IT WILL
NEVER WITHSTAND THE
INTENSITY OF THESE BEAMS.

32:48.097 --> 32:49.438
WE NEED SOMETHING
TO SUPPORT IT.

32:49.438 --> 32:51.000
SOMETHING HARD AND FLAT.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.173
HOW ABOUT ADAM'S HEAD?

32:54.173 --> 32:55.744
WHAT ABOUT YOUR
BELT BUCKLE?

32:55.744 --> 32:58.107
YES!

32:58.107 --> 33:01.010
WAIT, THIS IS CUSTOM.

33:01.010 --> 33:04.553
REALLY?

33:06.115 --> 33:07.986
THERE.
NOW WE'VE GOT A MIRROR.

33:07.986 --> 33:08.987
STEP ASIDE, BREE.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.559
LET THE BIG BOYS
TAKE CARE OF THIS.

33:10.559 --> 33:13.322
OH, OKAY.
WHEN ARE THEY
GETTING HERE?

33:19.198 --> 33:20.369
WITHOUT MY BIONICS,

33:20.369 --> 33:22.571
I COULD NEVER FIGURE OUT
THE PRECISE ANGLE.

33:22.571 --> 33:26.335
WE'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO... GUESSTIMATE.

33:26.335 --> 33:28.537
All: OH!

33:28.537 --> 33:31.640
WE CAN'T GET THIS WRONG.
WE ONLY HAVE ONE SHOT.

33:31.640 --> 33:34.383
YEAH, NO PRESSURE.

33:34.383 --> 33:35.614
TILT BACK ON THE Z AXIS.

33:35.614 --> 33:38.647
ALMOST GOT IT.
 NO, NO, NOT THAT ONE.
THAT ONE.

33:40.149 --> 33:41.720
I HAD MY SNACK,
I'M READY TO HELP.

33:41.720 --> 33:45.194
HOLD THIS.

33:47.096 --> 33:51.700
( Don & Chase stammering )

33:51.700 --> 33:54.603
JUST GIVE IT TO ME.

33:56.405 --> 33:58.107
( loud whirr, explosion )

34:01.410 --> 34:03.812
AND THAT'S HOW
YOU GET IT DONE, BOYS.

34:03.812 --> 34:05.174
YOLO.

34:07.246 --> 34:09.277
OUR BIONICS ARE BACK.

34:09.277 --> 34:10.719
COME ON,
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

34:14.152 --> 34:16.125
BRAVO.

34:16.125 --> 34:18.087
BUT JUST A DOG GETS
OUT OF HIS CAGE

34:18.087 --> 34:19.458
DOESN'T MEAN HE'S
GOING FOR A WALK.

34:19.458 --> 34:21.830
YOU HAVE A DOG?
WHERE, WHERE, WHERE?

34:21.830 --> 34:25.464
DOUGLAS. YOU'RE NOT
GETTING THESE KIDS.

34:25.464 --> 34:26.565
WRONG AGAIN, DONNY.

34:26.565 --> 34:28.697
LOOK, THE DECRYPTION
IS COMPLETE.

34:28.697 --> 34:32.801
NOW I'LL HAVE TOTAL
CONTROL OF THEIR--

34:32.801 --> 34:34.443
MAN! NOT COOL!

34:34.443 --> 34:38.806
WHAT'RE YOU WEARING,
CLOGS?

34:38.806 --> 34:41.179
- GUYS, RUN!
- WE'RE NOT LEAVING WITHOUT YOU.

34:41.179 --> 34:42.650
JUST GO!

34:42.650 --> 34:43.482
MARCUS, STOP THEM!

34:46.485 --> 34:47.755
OUT OF OUR WAY, MARCUS.

34:47.755 --> 34:50.819
NOT A CHANCE. I'M MORE
POWERFUL THAN ALL OF YOU.

34:50.819 --> 34:53.621
OH, HE'S LYING. HAVEN'T SEEN
HIM AT THE GYM ONCE.

34:58.727 --> 35:00.569
ADAM!

35:08.537 --> 35:11.610
NO ONE TOUCHES
MY BROTHER, YOU FREAK.

35:17.186 --> 35:18.387
( grunts )

35:24.593 --> 35:26.455
LET'S MAKE THIS FUN, HUH?

35:30.299 --> 35:33.702
( keypad beeps, gears whirr )

35:36.565 --> 35:39.338
( yells )
WHO HAS THAT IN THEIR HOUSE?

35:41.240 --> 35:43.172
THIS PLACE USED TO BE
A SAUSAGE FACTORY.

35:43.172 --> 35:44.813
YOU COULD FIT
A WHOLE COW IN THERE.

35:46.345 --> 35:49.218
CHASE, HOLD ON!

35:49.218 --> 35:51.580
ADAM, GO SEE IF ANY OF THOSE
BUTTONS WILL CLOSE THE FLOOR.

35:51.580 --> 35:52.921
OOOH, BUTTONS.

36:06.164 --> 36:07.636
HEY, I THINK I GOT IT.

36:11.740 --> 36:13.872
NO, STILL WORKING ON IT.

36:13.872 --> 36:15.774
WORK FASTER!

36:23.512 --> 36:25.314
NICE TRY, CUPCAKE.

36:27.356 --> 36:29.288
ADAM, HURRY!

36:38.867 --> 36:40.229
( groans )

36:41.300 --> 36:43.632
SAY GOODBYE, CHASE.

36:43.632 --> 36:45.534
NO!

36:45.534 --> 36:49.638
GOT IT!

36:49.638 --> 36:50.839
OOOH.

36:52.581 --> 36:53.882
OW!

37:00.489 --> 37:03.322
YOU MAY BE STRONG,
BUT LET'S SEE YOU
TAKE ON ALL THREE OF US.

37:03.322 --> 37:06.525
GO AHEAD, CREEP.
TAKE YOUR BEST SHOT.

37:06.525 --> 37:08.727
GLADLY.

37:19.438 --> 37:21.840
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, WE'RE
STILL FIGHTING OVER THE REMOTE?

37:44.663 --> 37:47.596
HA! NOW THEIR BIONICS
ARE ALL MINE!

37:47.596 --> 37:48.737
NO!

37:48.737 --> 37:52.541
( loud crash )

37:52.541 --> 37:53.542
WHAT THE--?

37:53.542 --> 37:56.975
Leo:
EXOSKELETON IN THE HOUSE!

37:56.975 --> 38:00.349
OR WHATEVER YOU CALL
THIS FUNKY PLACE.

38:00.349 --> 38:02.611
LEO, YOU'RE ALIVE!

38:02.611 --> 38:04.583
( yells )

38:04.583 --> 38:06.855
I ASK YOU TO DO ONE THING!

38:09.718 --> 38:10.919
( remote crunches )

38:10.919 --> 38:13.962
YOU BROKE IT!
YOU ALWAYS BREAK MY TOYS!

38:15.824 --> 38:17.295
NOT THE HAIR.
NOT THE HAIR.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.668
YOU, NOT THE HAIR! OW!

38:19.668 --> 38:22.531
( laser fire )

38:22.531 --> 38:24.573
HOW DO YOU
LIKE ME NOW, MARCUS?

38:24.573 --> 38:26.004
STILL NOT A FAN.

38:28.537 --> 38:30.308
( electric crackle )

38:30.308 --> 38:32.941
SO THIS THING CAN BUST THROUGH
WALLS AND SHOOT LASERS

38:32.941 --> 38:34.813
BUT IT CAN'T GET BACK UP?

38:34.813 --> 38:37.746
WELL, IT'S A PROTOTYPE.

38:39.047 --> 38:41.490
YOU JUST DON'T SEEM
TO GO AWAY, LEO.

38:41.490 --> 38:44.593
THIS TIME I'M GOING
TO FINISH YOU FOR GOOD.

38:44.593 --> 38:45.554
( whirring )

38:45.554 --> 38:48.026
( screaming )

38:48.026 --> 38:49.097
LEO'S ALIVE!

38:49.097 --> 38:51.400
NUH-UH.
NOT FOR LONG.

38:51.400 --> 38:53.932
GET AWAY FROM HIM.
( electric crackle )

38:57.666 --> 38:58.937
WHAT'S GOING ON?

38:58.937 --> 39:00.609
I THINK HE JUST DISCOVERED
HIS NEW ABILITY.

39:00.609 --> 39:02.411
I THINK WE SHOULD
GET BEHIND HIM.

39:05.474 --> 39:09.918
( deafening boom )

39:09.918 --> 39:13.081
( alarm blaring )

39:13.081 --> 39:16.585
THAT WAS AWESOME.

39:16.585 --> 39:19.357
WOW. ALL THAT FROM
ONE GRANOLA BAR.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.560
WHAT'S GOING ON?
ARE WE WINNING?

39:24.533 --> 39:27.365
WE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE.
THE WHOLE PLACE IS COMING DOWN.

39:30.469 --> 39:32.370
- WHERE'S DOUGLAS?
- WE HAVE TO GO NOW.

39:32.370 --> 39:36.675
YOU ARE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

39:39.147 --> 39:43.552
MARCUS! LOOK OUT!

39:43.552 --> 39:45.414
LET'S GO!

39:55.994 --> 39:58.797
( gears whirring )

40:10.178 --> 40:11.840
GUYS, I JUST WANTED
TO TELL YOU.

40:11.840 --> 40:14.513
I'M REALLY PROUD OF
WHAT YOU DID TODAY.

40:14.513 --> 40:17.616
I'M REALLY PROUD
OF WHO YOU'VE BECOME.

40:17.616 --> 40:19.588
YOUR HEROES.

40:19.588 --> 40:21.620
THAT'S ALL I EVER
WANTED YOU TO BE.

40:21.620 --> 40:22.851
YOU TOO, LEO.

40:22.851 --> 40:24.723
THANKS, BIG D.

40:24.723 --> 40:26.825
SORRY, ABOUT YOUR
EXOSKELETON.

40:26.825 --> 40:28.557
YOU CAN TAKE IT OUT
OF MY ALLOWANCE.

40:28.557 --> 40:29.798
IT COST A MILLION DOLLARS.

40:29.798 --> 40:32.160
EASY COME, EASY GO.

40:32.160 --> 40:35.834
MOST OF ALL,
I'M SORRY I LIED TO YOU.

40:35.834 --> 40:37.536
YOU DON'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE.

40:37.536 --> 40:39.668
WE GET IT.

40:39.668 --> 40:42.511
AT LEAST NOW YOU KNOW DOUGLAS
IS YOUR REAL FATHER.

40:44.212 --> 40:46.945
NO. HE'S NOT.

40:46.945 --> 40:52.751
HE MAY HAVE CREATED US,
BUT YOU MADE US WHO WE ARE.

40:52.751 --> 40:54.623
YOU ARE OUR FATHER.

40:54.623 --> 40:56.685
COME HERE.

41:00.028 --> 41:02.861
WOW, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
WE'VE EVER SEEN YOU CRY.

41:02.861 --> 41:04.462
I'M NOT CRYING,
I'M IN PAIN.

41:04.462 --> 41:06.835
I THINK I CRACKED A RIB.
IT REALLY HURTS. REALLY.

41:12.971 --> 41:15.674

41:15.674 --> 41:21.550
IT IS SO NICE TO BE HOME

HEY, CONGRATS
ON DISCOVERING
THE NEW ABILITY.

41:23.652 --> 41:27.616

A TRUE MISSION SPECIALIST.

41:35.624 --> 41:37.666
WAY TO FILL MY SHOES.

41:37.666 --> 41:39.968
BIG D, I COULD NEVER
FILL YOUR SHOES.

41:39.968 --> 41:42.701
OR FIT IN THEM.

41:42.701 --> 41:44.833
SOME REALLY TINY
KICKERS, MAN.
