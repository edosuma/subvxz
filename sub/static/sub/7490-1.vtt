WEBVTT

00:12.208 --> 00:13.750
How are you doing? It's my first day.

00:14.166 --> 00:16.667
- What would you recommend?
- Not this stuff.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.583
I don't know what half of it is.

00:25.917 --> 00:28.166
All right, that was almost cool.

00:28.250 --> 00:30.458
- I'm Kim.
- I'm Jack. I'm new.

00:31.041 --> 00:32.250
Yeah, I can tell.

00:32.333 --> 00:33.917
You still have that new-guy smell.

00:36.959 --> 00:39.083
Um, can I have my apple back?

00:39.917 --> 00:41.667
Oh, sorry.

00:42.166 --> 00:44.917
- Well, maybe I'll see you around, Kim.
- Maybe you will.

00:48.375 --> 00:50.250
Hey, new kid.

00:50.375 --> 00:52.250
Uh, what are you doing, Eddie?

00:52.375 --> 00:55.834
We save that seat for cheerleaders,
prom queens and supermodels.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.333
Well, I'm Jack.

00:58.417 --> 01:00.417
- So how do you guys all know each other?
- We're friends.

01:00.500 --> 01:02.542
We do karate together after school.

01:02.625 --> 01:04.667
We don't just do karate, Milton.

01:04.750 --> 01:06.709
These fists are registered weapons.

01:06.792 --> 01:10.208
In fact, I've already gotten a few calls
about joining the Navy SEALS.

01:10.291 --> 01:13.208
Navy SEALS? You're afraid of baby seals.

01:17.125 --> 01:20.625
- Gah!
-

01:20.709 --> 01:21.875
That's awesome.

01:21.959 --> 01:24.750
A kid from the Black Dragon dojo
just whaled you with--

01:26.041 --> 01:27.709
Not cool, man. Not cool.

01:30.083 --> 01:31.542
Aren't you gonna do anything?

01:32.208 --> 01:33.834
Wait, I thought you guys knew karate.

01:33.917 --> 01:35.417
Yes, we do.

01:37.041 --> 01:38.375
But they know it better.

01:39.583 --> 01:41.458
It's cool. I got this.

01:42.583 --> 01:45.542
Why did we learn his name?
Now I'm gonna miss him.

01:46.917 --> 01:49.125
Hey, I like your outfits.

01:49.208 --> 01:51.125
You guys, uh, cheerleaders?

01:51.208 --> 01:54.583
No. Well, Brian used to be.

01:55.959 --> 01:59.375
So, you got a problem or something?

02:02.458 --> 02:03.917
I didn't come over here to fight, man.

02:04.417 --> 02:05.458
Rah!

02:06.041 --> 02:08.959

done that.

04:03.959 --> 04:05.667
Hi, I'm sensei Rudy

04:05.750 --> 04:08.542
and I run the Bobby Wasabi
Martial Arts Academy.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.375
Fun day at the beach ruined by
a gang of ninjas?

04:19.542 --> 04:20.792
Wipeout!

04:21.333 --> 04:24.875
Come on down to the Bobby Wasabi
Martial Arts Academy today

04:24.959 --> 04:30.750
and I'll teach you how
to throw a foot-fist fiesta!

04:33.375 --> 04:35.959
Now that's what
you call marketing, fellas.

04:36.041 --> 04:37.083
What'd you think?

04:37.166 --> 04:40.417
We think this is the worst dojo
in the Bobby Wasabi chain.

04:40.500 --> 04:42.875
- What?
- None of your students are advancing.

04:42.959 --> 04:45.125
If you don't win two belts
at the next tournament,

04:45.208 --> 04:46.667
we're closing you down.

04:46.750 --> 04:48.917
-
- Closing me down?

04:49.000 --> 04:50.208
Yah!

04:50.291 --> 04:51.375
Oh!

04:51.458 --> 04:53.375
-
- Whoo!

04:53.458 --> 04:55.917
I love doing that.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.625
<i>Ha!
Dude.</i>

04:57.709 --> 05:00.834
Eddie just got dusted by
Marge the lunch lady again.

05:03.625 --> 05:05.250
Guys, what are you doing?

05:05.375 --> 05:07.583
They said if we don't win two belts
at our next tournament,

05:07.667 --> 05:09.000
they're shutting us down.

05:09.083 --> 05:10.792
Yo, Rudy, you wanna win some belts?

05:10.875 --> 05:12.417
You should get that new kid Jack in here.

05:12.500 --> 05:13.667
He was awesome!

05:13.750 --> 05:17.000
At lunch he took out four Black Dragons
all by himself.

05:17.083 --> 05:19.500
I don't care about
some slap fight at school.

05:19.583 --> 05:22.125
Martial arts isn't about beating kids up
in the lunchroom.

05:22.208 --> 05:24.792
It's about getting better
through hard work and discipline.

05:30.709 --> 05:31.792
What?

05:32.250 --> 05:34.166
You should be happy
it came out the right end.

05:39.208 --> 05:41.583
That new kid Jack
is on his skateboard again!

05:45.792 --> 05:47.041
I'm in pursuit.

05:49.583 --> 05:50.959
Everyone focus.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.208
-
Jack!

05:55.291 --> 05:56.417
Come here!

05:57.250 --> 05:58.709
Jack!

06:01.917 --> 06:03.333
Whoa! Watch out!

06:11.542 --> 06:14.166
That boy just came right out the wall!

06:14.250 --> 06:17.750
Okay, you guys have got to try that.

06:17.834 --> 06:20.208
- Come here, you.
- Gotta go.

06:20.291 --> 06:21.333
Sorry about the wall.

06:26.750 --> 06:28.083
Who was that kid?

06:28.834 --> 06:29.917
Jack.

06:31.125 --> 06:32.583
Oh!

06:38.375 --> 06:40.041
You're in big trouble, Jack.

06:40.125 --> 06:43.667
But if you join my dojo
and help me win two belts,

06:43.750 --> 06:46.333
I'll tear up this report
and you won't have to go to juvie.

06:46.959 --> 06:49.500
- Juvie?
- That's jail for kids, fella.

06:50.959 --> 06:54.375
I would join your dojo,
but I'm not a karate guy.

06:54.458 --> 06:55.458
I'm a skater.

06:55.542 --> 06:57.834
You took out four Black Dragons
all by yourself

06:57.917 --> 07:00.250
and did a perfect flying side-kick
through my wall.

07:01.583 --> 07:05.083
Okay, the truth is my grandfather
was a karate sensei.

07:05.792 --> 07:08.458
He even trained Bobby Wasabi
for all of his movies.

07:09.792 --> 07:11.917
Your grandfather trained Bobby Wasabi,

07:12.000 --> 07:15.583
the founder of this dojo
and star of such classic movies

07:15.667 --> 07:19.750
as "Samurai Beach Party," "Kung Fu Cop,"

07:19.834 --> 07:23.291
- and "Nana Was A Ninja"?
- Yep.

07:23.792 --> 07:27.041
You know this dojo was built on
the principles of the Wasabi code.

07:29.375 --> 07:31.583
We swear by
the light of the dragon's eye

07:31.667 --> 07:34.750
to be loyal and honest and never say die.

07:34.834 --> 07:36.375
- Wasabi!
- Wasabi!

07:38.542 --> 07:39.667
So do we have a deal?

07:40.625 --> 07:41.458
Deal.

07:46.125 --> 07:47.792
<i>♪ kickin' it with you. ♪</i>

07:47.875 --> 07:51.792
- Hey, Jack.
Hel-lo, Kim!

07:52.500 --> 07:54.542
- Um, can I talk to you for a minute?
- Pleasure.

07:54.625 --> 07:55.875
- What's up?
- Yeah, I'm free.

07:57.208 --> 07:59.333
Guys, can you give me a sec? Vamoose.

08:02.250 --> 08:03.500
That means go.

08:04.166 --> 08:05.750
I know what "vamoose" means.

08:14.917 --> 08:16.875
Looks like you know
something about karate.

08:16.959 --> 08:18.041
A little bit.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.875
So what are you doing at Bobby Wasabi?

08:21.000 --> 08:23.250
You should be training
at the best dojo in town.

08:23.333 --> 08:25.375
Really? What do you know about karate?

08:26.500 --> 08:28.750
- Hi-yah!
-

08:29.542 --> 08:31.959
I guess you do know
a little something about karate.

08:32.041 --> 08:34.208
This place made me a black belt.

08:34.250 --> 08:36.959
Everything at the Black Dragon
is best of the best.

08:37.458 --> 08:40.875
I heard if Bobby Wasabi doesn't win
two belts at the tournament this week,

08:40.959 --> 08:42.542
their doors will finally close.

08:43.458 --> 08:45.667
I've got to get him to join us.

08:45.750 --> 08:49.125
Ah, Jack, I've heard so much about you.

08:49.208 --> 08:51.291
I want you to know
that if you join this dojo,

08:51.375 --> 08:54.458
you will become like a cobra--
Fast, dangerous

08:54.542 --> 08:56.417
and quite comfortable
sleeping in a basket.

08:57.208 --> 09:00.250
What sensei is trying to say is,
if you train here,

09:00.333 --> 09:01.959
we'll make you a champion.

09:02.041 --> 09:03.375
Check out this bo staff.

09:04.375 --> 09:07.166
That is four ounces of
perfectly-balanced graphite.

09:07.250 --> 09:08.917
It's the same one the astronauts use.

09:09.667 --> 09:13.208
You know, for when they need
a bo staff in space.

09:17.166 --> 09:19.250
Yes, very nice. Excellent.

09:19.375 --> 09:20.834
Whoa, you almost took my head off!

09:22.750 --> 09:24.750
So what do you say, Jack?

09:24.834 --> 09:26.291
Will you join The Black Dragons?

09:27.417 --> 09:30.250
I'd like to, but I can't.

09:31.333 --> 09:34.208
Jack, come on. Bobby Wasabi's a joke.

09:34.291 --> 09:36.041
Come on, it's not a joke to me.

09:36.125 --> 09:39.333
I gave my word. It's the Wasabi code.

09:39.417 --> 09:40.709
"The Wasabi code."

09:40.792 --> 09:41.917
Zip it, Frank.

09:42.834 --> 09:45.834
- Well, here you go.
- You keep it.

09:45.917 --> 09:48.333
Let it be a reminder
that you're always welcome here.

09:48.375 --> 09:50.166
Wow! Thanks!

09:51.792 --> 09:53.458
But that was my bo staff.

09:53.542 --> 09:55.625
- My mom gave it to me--
- And I gave it to her.

09:55.709 --> 09:57.041
That's right, you heard me.

09:57.125 --> 09:58.166
I'm seeing her!

10:00.917 --> 10:02.083
What?

10:06.000 --> 10:07.583
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.

10:07.667 --> 10:08.959
Sorry doesn't cut it, Jack.

10:09.041 --> 10:11.959
Wait, where did you get
that astronaut bo staff?

10:13.125 --> 10:14.875
It was a gift from the Black Dragons.

10:14.959 --> 10:17.875
- See, we can all use it. Look.
- Ah, no..

10:17.959 --> 10:21.375
No, students from this dojo are forbidden
from even entering the Black Dragon.

10:21.458 --> 10:24.542
What? You can't forbid
me from doing anything.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.375
How could you betray me like this?

10:26.500 --> 10:27.375
If it wasn't for me,

10:27.458 --> 10:29.375
you would have been banned
from this mall for two weeks.

10:31.959 --> 10:33.834
Banned from the mall?

10:33.917 --> 10:35.959
Wait, you said I was going to juvie.

10:38.667 --> 10:41.667
You know, I say a lot of things.

10:42.583 --> 10:44.250
I'm what they call chatty.

10:44.750 --> 10:46.500
You lied to me.

10:46.583 --> 10:48.333
You broke the Wasabi code.

10:48.417 --> 10:49.542
What?

10:52.667 --> 10:55.333
Kim was right, this place is a joke.

10:55.417 --> 10:56.625
I'm out of here.

10:57.583 --> 10:59.542
Fine, go ahead.

11:01.959 --> 11:03.750
- Who needs him?
We do.

11:05.583 --> 11:06.792
What have I done?

11:06.875 --> 11:09.166
Come back! Come back!

11:09.583 --> 11:10.875
Come back!

11:19.625 --> 11:23.041
- Jack, you're back.
- I'm just here to get my stuff.

11:23.125 --> 11:25.375
- What's going on?
- We're closing.

11:25.458 --> 11:27.750
No Jack, no belts, no dojo.

11:29.166 --> 11:30.917
Milton David Krupnick.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.959
So this is your French horn lesson, huh?

11:34.041 --> 11:35.417
Dad, I'm sorry.

11:35.500 --> 11:37.000
I was taking karate lessons

11:37.083 --> 11:40.125
because kids kept beating me up
for taking French horn lessons.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
Let's go, Milton.
You're lucky you didn't hurt yourself.

11:44.083 --> 11:45.625
It's closing anyway.

11:46.709 --> 11:49.291
This is the only place
I felt I really belonged.

11:50.834 --> 11:52.709
I'll let my bully know I'm available.

11:53.709 --> 11:57.583
Now my mom's gonna send me back
to Mrs. King's Dance academy.

11:57.709 --> 12:00.417
My body was not made to mambo.

12:01.917 --> 12:03.250
Guess I'm a lone wolf again.

12:03.375 --> 12:04.500
And that's how I like it.

12:05.792 --> 12:08.917
Don't think for a second
I'm gonna miss any of you meat bags.

12:10.875 --> 12:12.208
See you around, guys.

12:15.542 --> 12:17.750
Milton, hang on.

12:20.583 --> 12:23.083
Why don't you show your dad
how you can break a board?

12:23.166 --> 12:24.291
Break a board?

12:24.375 --> 12:27.125
I can barely cut
a well-cooked piece of fish.

12:27.208 --> 12:29.583
Just believe in yourself and do it.

12:29.667 --> 12:30.750
I can't.

12:30.834 --> 12:34.041
When I was born, my parents thought
they had given birth to a baby bird.

12:34.125 --> 12:35.750
- I mean that--
- Do it, Krupnick!

12:35.834 --> 12:37.417
A-ah!

12:40.208 --> 12:42.333
Holy Christmas nuts!

12:42.417 --> 12:43.375
Milton?

12:43.458 --> 12:46.041
That ain't no baby bird
right there, uh-uh.

12:48.959 --> 12:51.291
That was unbelievable, Jack.

12:51.375 --> 12:53.208
These guys are your friends.

12:53.291 --> 12:55.083
They didn't break the Wasabi code.

12:55.834 --> 12:58.542
- I did.
- I broke it too.

13:00.291 --> 13:02.417
You don't walk away from your friends
when they need you.

13:05.083 --> 13:06.291
Wasabi?

13:09.417 --> 13:10.417
Wasabi.

13:10.500 --> 13:12.917
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

13:13.041 --> 13:14.917
- Hup!
-

13:15.000 --> 13:18.083

14:36.083 --> 14:38.709
<i>Let the competition begin!</i>

14:38.792 --> 14:40.625
Okay, guys, Eddie's up first.

14:42.333 --> 14:44.125
Aw, man. Hey.

14:45.875 --> 14:48.500
Jack, the guy I'm fighting is huge.

14:48.583 --> 14:49.959
Oh, come on, he's not that big.

14:51.667 --> 14:52.792
Wow!

14:53.458 --> 14:55.542
What do they feed you, brother?

14:55.625 --> 14:57.667
You're going down.

14:58.583 --> 15:00.166
I don't think I can do this.

15:00.250 --> 15:03.166
Even Marge the lunch lady
throws me around.

15:03.583 --> 15:07.959
Eddie, look, this is your day
to change all of that.

15:08.041 --> 15:11.125
If losing to Marge gets you angry,
then use it.

15:11.667 --> 15:13.709
- Come on, man.
- Come on, Eddie!

15:13.792 --> 15:16.041
- You got this one.
- Come on, Eddie!

15:16.125 --> 15:19.542
<i>Come on, man.</i>
-

15:19.625 --> 15:21.583
You going down.

15:21.667 --> 15:23.959
Ha-ha ha-ha!

15:24.041 --> 15:25.667
Marge!

15:35.208 --> 15:37.500
He did it! We got our first belt!

15:37.583 --> 15:40.125
Okay, nunchucks are up next.

15:40.208 --> 15:41.709
Jerry, all you gotta do is--

15:41.792 --> 15:44.750
Save it, Jack. I got this.

15:45.417 --> 15:47.583
- All right.
- All right. Come on, Jerry!

15:53.375 --> 15:54.875
Ha!

15:57.834 --> 16:00.834
- Ha!
-

16:00.917 --> 16:03.166
Not bad. Check this out.

16:08.417 --> 16:10.166
- Yeah.
- Whoo!

16:14.542 --> 16:18.125
- Hey, man, are you okay?
- Everything is purple.

16:23.125 --> 16:25.458
Okay, Milton, you're up next.

16:25.542 --> 16:27.500
if you can break more boards
than your opponent,

16:27.583 --> 16:29.208
we win our second belt.

16:29.291 --> 16:30.750
I'm ready, Rudy.

16:31.792 --> 16:34.583
Would you please take off the oven mitts?

16:34.667 --> 16:38.125
By oven mitts do you mean weapon warmers?

16:40.583 --> 16:42.000
I love you, Milton!

16:43.458 --> 16:45.375
I love you too, Dad!

16:46.083 --> 16:49.250
Wasabi! Ya, ya, ya!

17:02.125 --> 17:03.250
Whoo!

17:05.375 --> 17:06.834
Double it.

17:07.792 --> 17:11.125
Yes! My man's going for the win!

17:13.834 --> 17:17.041
<i>Go, Milton!</i>
- A-ah!

17:20.834 --> 17:23.583
- You go, baby bird!
- He's got the belt.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.625
We're saved! I get to keep the dojo!

17:25.709 --> 17:28.500
-
- Eat that, Black Dragons!

17:28.583 --> 17:32.083
You don't have Milton Krupnick
to kick around anymore.

17:33.875 --> 17:36.208
- Ah! Stop!
- No, no!

17:36.250 --> 17:38.083
He's doing a nipple twister!
That's illegal.

17:46.792 --> 17:50.667
Milton, you lost the belt.
It was in your hands.

17:50.750 --> 17:52.417
You have any idea what that means?

17:52.500 --> 17:55.542
It means I just had
the best moment of my life.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.291
That's it.

17:57.375 --> 17:59.417
I have to move back in with my parents.

17:59.500 --> 18:02.500
Rudy, we've still got a chance.

18:02.583 --> 18:04.750
Jack's doing the vertical peg kick.

18:04.834 --> 18:07.250
I was hoping
we'd be on the same team, Jack.

18:07.333 --> 18:09.375
But now I'm gonna have to take you down.

18:09.834 --> 18:12.083
You know, I think you have
a little crush on me.

18:12.166 --> 18:13.709
Ew, no.

18:13.792 --> 18:17.458
Yeah, I think you do.

18:19.417 --> 18:20.959
He can't win that belt, Frank.

18:21.750 --> 18:24.417
You know what you have to do.

18:26.291 --> 18:28.291
- Hi-cha!
Ah!

18:29.959 --> 18:32.750
- Oh, no, he didn't!
Ow!

18:32.834 --> 18:34.583
Frank, that is so wrong.

18:34.667 --> 18:36.542
You are banished from this dojo.

18:36.625 --> 18:38.291
Banished, I say!

18:39.625 --> 18:44.125
- Rudy, I can't get up.
- Yes, you can. You're the champ.

18:44.208 --> 18:47.208
You gotta get up. You gotta get up, champ!

18:47.291 --> 18:50.291
Rudy, I can't get up
because you're kneeling on my leg.

18:50.375 --> 18:51.625
Oh, sorry. My bad.

18:58.542 --> 19:00.667
Okay, scorpion, go kick out that peg

19:00.750 --> 19:02.959
so we can say goodbye
to Bobby Wasabi forever.

19:03.875 --> 19:05.333
I'm not gonna do it.

19:05.417 --> 19:07.000
- I quit.
- What?

19:07.083 --> 19:09.375
You're nothing but a cheater
and a big baby.

19:09.458 --> 19:10.542
Nuh-uh.

19:10.625 --> 19:12.709
Take that back! Take that back!

19:13.583 --> 19:16.792
Oh, don't-- don't-- Ugh, really?

19:19.333 --> 19:21.333
So are you gonna be able to do this?

19:22.458 --> 19:23.458
I don't know.

19:24.625 --> 19:26.917
Your whole dojo's counting on you.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.667
If I do it, will you admit
you have a crush on me?

19:30.750 --> 19:32.583
I do not have a crush on you!

19:35.125 --> 19:36.667
Mm-hmm.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.917
I can't believe
he's gonna launch off one foot.

19:44.625 --> 19:46.792
That's one bad mama jama.

19:48.458 --> 19:50.417
He's not launching off his foot.

19:50.500 --> 19:52.333
He's launching off his hands.

19:52.417 --> 19:54.792
That's only been done once before,

19:54.875 --> 19:58.542
by a man named Bobby Wasabi.

19:58.625 --> 20:00.709
Whoa.

20:07.250 --> 20:11.667
now my mom's gonna send me
Back to Mrs. King's Dance Academy.

20:11.750 --> 20:14.375
Don't think for a second
I'm gonna miss any of you meat bags.

20:15.333 --> 20:17.959
This is the only place
I felt I really belonged.

20:50.959 --> 20:54.166
- We got our belts! We got our belts!
- Yes.

20:55.041 --> 20:56.667
I hate Bobby Wasabi!

20:58.250 --> 21:01.458
Come on, guys, We're going home.

21:01.542 --> 21:05.333
- You know what I'm feeling?
- I think we're all feeling it.

21:05.417 --> 21:07.583
Whoo!

21:15.000 --> 21:16.208
Wasabi!

21:25.166 --> 21:27.458
Okay, guys.
Come on, let's get to work, All right?

21:32.208 --> 21:34.250
Kim, what are you doing here?

21:34.333 --> 21:36.083
I quit the Black Dragon.

21:36.166 --> 21:37.750
You guys were all right in the tournament,

21:37.834 --> 21:40.834
but the way I see it,
you need all the help you can get.

21:40.917 --> 21:42.709
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:42.792 --> 21:46.792
You're gonna just walk in here and assume
you're gonna be a part of our dojo?

21:46.875 --> 21:49.875
- You have to pass a test.
- Okay.

21:58.125 --> 21:59.583
- What do you think, guys?
- She's in.

21:59.667 --> 22:00.834
- Got my vote.
- A+.
