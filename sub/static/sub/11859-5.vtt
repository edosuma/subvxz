WEBVTT

00:02.625 --> 00:04.709
[men counting cadence]
Hep, hup! Hep, hup!
Hep, hup! Hep, hup!

00:32.959 --> 00:35.375
(Jimmy)
'Swabbie's got a head
like a '49 Ford, Max.'

00:35.458 --> 00:36.625
(Max)
'Come on, Tully.
Last round.'

00:36.709 --> 00:38.542
You gotta knock
this anchor-clanker
out!

00:38.625 --> 00:40.291
'You just got to
wear him down, Tully.'

00:40.375 --> 00:41.667
'You're a Marine, okay?'

00:41.750 --> 00:44.041
Come on,
Tully.
Let's go.

01:26.250 --> 01:28.625
Listen up, Marines!

01:28.709 --> 01:30.750
Shore leave
commences at 1300.

01:31.917 --> 01:34.333
As Marines, you will
conduct yourself

01:34.417 --> 01:38.417
with honor, valor,
and fidelity.

01:40.709 --> 01:42.834
Outstanding job,
PFC Tully.

01:46.041 --> 01:49.000
Private First Class Snow,
what in Sam Hill is this?

01:49.083 --> 01:51.667
Sir, it won't
stay
bloused, sir!

01:51.750 --> 01:54.000
It won't stay bloused
because you do not belong

01:54.083 --> 01:55.834
'in my beloved Corps!'

01:55.917 --> 01:58.917
I suggest you unscrew
yourself ASAP!

02:00.041 --> 02:02.041
Well, any day, sweetheart!

02:02.125 --> 02:04.333
Sir, yes, sir!

02:04.417 --> 02:07.792
PFC Tully, tell me
why I should not cancel
liberty

02:07.875 --> 02:11.417
for all hands because of PFC
Snowball's personal appearance?

02:11.500 --> 02:14.041
Sir, PFC Snow will
square himself
away!

02:14.125 --> 02:16.417
Marines take care of their
own!
That is our code, Sergeant!

02:16.500 --> 02:18.083
Outstanding answer,
PFC Tully!

02:22.208 --> 02:23.542
Stand by!

02:30.542 --> 02:32.709
Platoon, dismissed!

02:32.792 --> 02:34.375
(soldiers)
Aye, aye, Sergeant!

02:34.458 --> 02:36.333
- Do it!
- Ooh-rah!

02:36.417 --> 02:37.709
Whoo!

03:09.500 --> 03:11.917
(John)
'I love the smell of toxic
waste
in the morning.'

03:12.000 --> 03:13.500
Hey, you wanna watch
your step.

03:13.583 --> 03:14.834
The place is full of stuff

03:14.917 --> 03:16.500
that'll eat your
Florsheims for
breakfast.

03:16.583 --> 03:18.208
(John)
'Oh, what do we have?'

03:18.291 --> 03:19.750
(Lilly)
'A land test
on a real estate deal'

03:19.834 --> 03:22.250
turned up toxic
levels
of you-name-it.

03:22.333 --> 03:25.125
EPA clean-up crew found
the remains inside.

03:25.208 --> 03:27.333
(Scotty)
It was adult male
shot in the head.

03:27.417 --> 03:30.208
ME tech ballparks it
at .38 caliber.

03:30.291 --> 03:31.458
How long has it been here?

03:31.542 --> 03:33.291
Agency says the
land
hasn't been used

03:33.375 --> 03:36.291
as a legal dump
site
in over 50 years.

03:36.375 --> 03:37.625
(John)
'We need to find out
who had access'

03:37.709 --> 03:38.709
'permission to
dump here.'

03:38.792 --> 03:40.208
Yeah, ought to be fun.

03:40.291 --> 03:43.083
'EPA's lawyers have been
trying
to sort that out for years.'

03:43.166 --> 03:44.834
(Lilly)
'What's that? Dog tags?'

03:44.917 --> 03:49.041
"Tully, James, C. USMC."

03:52.208 --> 03:54.583
Looks like we just found
a lost Marine.

04:33.667 --> 04:36.792
(John)
'Marine Private Class
James C. Tully.'

04:36.875 --> 04:40.709
Accused of desertion,
September 9, 1951.

04:40.792 --> 04:42.959
Stationed
<i>Pronto</i>

04:43.041 --> 04:45.166
on his way
to do battle in Korea.

04:45.250 --> 04:47.333
The forgotten war.

04:47.417 --> 04:48.917
Disappeared during liberty.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.458
He was supposed to be
<i>Pronto</i>

04:50.542 --> 04:54.291
morning of September
9,
at 0600 hours.

04:54.375 --> 04:55.542
He never showed.

04:55.625 --> 04:57.041
(Will)
'I think we know why.'

04:57.125 --> 04:59.000
(Lilly)
'The kid was only 17 years
old.'

04:59.083 --> 05:00.417
'Got into some kind of trouble.'

05:00.500 --> 05:02.375
(Will)
'On liberty,
that's no surprise.'

05:02.458 --> 05:03.834
Drinking, shenanigans.

05:03.917 --> 05:05.125
Yeah, the last hoorah.

05:05.208 --> 05:07.709
Trying to get in as much
living as possible.

05:07.792 --> 05:09.959
Pretty high
casualty rate in Korea.

05:10.041 --> 05:11.208
Maybe he gets
cold feet?

05:11.291 --> 05:12.750
Ah, not likely.

05:12.834 --> 05:16.583
Marines aren't drafted.
They enlist or volunteer.

05:16.667 --> 05:18.709
Docks have always been
a dangerous place.

05:18.792 --> 05:21.166
He gets separated
from his fellow
Marines

05:21.250 --> 05:23.250
and runs into
some
local riff-raff?

05:23.333 --> 05:25.500
The guys in his platoon
might know something.

05:25.583 --> 05:27.625
Yeah, if we can
track them down.

05:27.709 --> 05:29.625
Well, brother Steve
Tully's
on his way to Philly

05:29.709 --> 05:31.166
to claim the remains.

05:31.250 --> 05:34.333
A decorated Marine
in Vietnam himself.

05:34.417 --> 05:36.917
The father served
in World War II.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.834
Whole family
of military men.

05:38.917 --> 05:40.792
Ah, must have been
a real disgrace

05:40.875 --> 05:43.208
Tully accused
of being a deserter.

05:43.291 --> 05:44.750
The family
never believed it.

05:44.834 --> 05:46.291
Sent the Naval Board
of Corrections

05:46.375 --> 05:49.709
countless letters refuting the
unauthorized absence charge..

05:49.792 --> 05:50.917
...to no avail.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.333
Trying to reverse
a charge like that

05:52.417 --> 05:53.667
with the military bureaucracy

05:53.750 --> 05:56.375
is like getting a
battleship
to reverse course

05:56.458 --> 05:58.458
slow and unlikely to happen.

05:58.542 --> 06:01.041
It's our job to see this
Marine
gets his honor back.

06:19.041 --> 06:21.250
(Will)
'Hey, what the..
My tie!'

06:21.333 --> 06:22.709
That's for aiding
and abetting

06:22.792 --> 06:24.750
in a decapitation
of my best tie last week.

06:24.834 --> 06:26.250
What makes you think
I had anything

06:26.333 --> 06:27.834
to do with that...incident?

06:27.917 --> 06:30.750
Oh, don't worry, your little
partner in crime, La Bamba..

06:30.834 --> 06:32.250
...he's gonna get his, too.

06:33.375 --> 06:35.041
What up, fellas?

06:35.125 --> 06:36.583
You tell me, Scotty.

06:50.625 --> 06:52.125
My father went
to his grave

06:52.208 --> 06:55.166
wondering if Jimmy was a coward.

06:55.250 --> 06:56.458
He fought the
desertion
ruling.

06:56.542 --> 06:58.083
He must have known
different in his heart.

06:59.291 --> 07:01.709
Said it wasn't
in Jimmy's DNA to desert.

07:01.792 --> 07:04.291
But he still wanted
the flag to prove it.

07:04.375 --> 07:07.125
My brother never backed down
from a fight in his life.

07:07.208 --> 07:08.834
(Lilly)
'Wondering if you
can tell us anything'

07:08.917 --> 07:11.750
about Jimmy might help us
with our investigation.

07:11.834 --> 07:14.500
Oh, yeah. Brought this..

07:14.583 --> 07:15.709
...postcard he sent us.

07:15.792 --> 07:17.417
It's the last time
we heard from him.

07:18.750 --> 07:21.625
"Our sergeant granted
us
a liberty pass.

07:21.709 --> 07:23.417
'"Me and a couple guys
from the platoon'

07:23.500 --> 07:24.834
"are gonna hit the town."

07:24.917 --> 07:26.333
You know who his friends were?

07:26.417 --> 07:29.166
No, I was just a kid
when he left for boot camp.

07:29.250 --> 07:30.709
Gave me his baseball glove.

07:30.792 --> 07:32.667
Told me to keep it oiled
for him.

07:32.750 --> 07:35.458
Promised to teach me
his curve ball when he got
back.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.750
Card's postmarked
the day he disappeared.

07:39.291 --> 07:41.333
I slept with it
under my pillow for years

07:41.417 --> 07:43.625
just thinking it
would bring him back.

07:45.792 --> 07:48.000
What about his pocket watch?

07:48.083 --> 07:50.000
Didn't they find it
with his, you know..

07:50.083 --> 07:51.583
Pocket watch? No.

07:51.667 --> 07:53.208
Oh, it definitely would
have been on him.

07:53.291 --> 07:54.417
He treasured that watch.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.792
Robbery gone bad?

07:56.875 --> 07:59.709
My father told him
it was his duty

07:59.792 --> 08:01.875
to bring the watch back safe

08:01.959 --> 08:03.959
and pass it on
to his own son someday.

08:07.542 --> 08:09.417
Never even made it
out of Philly.

08:13.291 --> 08:15.875
(Will)
'Sergeant Chaney, they said
we could find you here.'

08:19.333 --> 08:22.375
I volunteer twice a week
and school some of these men

08:22.458 --> 08:23.792
in checkers,
just to let them know

08:23.875 --> 08:26.417
that their sacrifice
still means something.

08:26.500 --> 08:28.041
Oh, wondering
what you remember

08:28.125 --> 08:31.959
about Private
First Class Jimmy Tully.

08:32.041 --> 08:34.917
One of nine guys that went
to Korea came back

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
in a body bag,
and you're asking me

08:37.083 --> 08:39.375
about a coward
that went AWOL?

08:39.458 --> 08:41.166
You were his
platoon sergeant, right?

08:41.250 --> 08:43.750
- Mm-hmm.
- That type of behavior fit?

08:43.834 --> 08:45.375
Well, the kid
was a hell of a
boxer.

08:45.458 --> 08:48.125
He beat the tar out
of the Navy's best
puncher

08:48.208 --> 08:50.583
the day of shore leave but
there's a hell of a
difference

08:50.667 --> 08:55.125
between taking a punch
and staring down enemy fire.

08:55.208 --> 08:57.250
His body turned up yesterday.

08:57.333 --> 08:59.208
We think he got
killed
on shore leave.

08:59.291 --> 09:00.917
'Anyone in his platoon
have a problem with him?'

09:01.000 --> 09:04.792
Whoa! If Tully was killed
it wasn't by another Marine.

09:04.875 --> 09:07.291
Any idea which of his friends
he might have hit Philly with?

09:07.375 --> 09:10.458
Yeah, there was a
guy
named Max, um..

09:10.542 --> 09:14.250
...Max Heid,
Heidhorn.
Heidhorn, yeah.

09:14.333 --> 09:16.125
He was a real clown.

09:16.208 --> 09:17.667
We'll look into it.

09:17.750 --> 09:19.542
Hey, detectives..

09:19.625 --> 09:22.083
...if a guy doesn't come
back to the ship

09:22.166 --> 09:23.375
I have no other choice

09:23.458 --> 09:25.417
'but to declare
him a deserter.'

09:29.875 --> 09:33.458
Max Heidhorn?
Detectives Rush,
Miller.

09:33.542 --> 09:35.792
'Thanks for coming in.'

09:35.875 --> 09:37.125
A fan of the ponies?

09:37.208 --> 09:38.500
I like to lay a few bets

09:38.583 --> 09:40.583
here and there,
keep things interesting.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.291
- You got a system?
- Yeah.

09:42.375 --> 09:44.792
It's called
"Win some, lose some."

09:44.875 --> 09:46.166
'But you didn't
ask me down here'

09:46.250 --> 09:48.917
to pick up tips
on the sport of kings.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Understand you
and Jimmy Tully were friends.

09:51.083 --> 09:54.375
Sure were. We survived
boot camp together.

09:54.458 --> 09:55.834
Were you with him
on shore leave?

09:55.917 --> 10:00.000
Me and about 500
other Marines and sailors.

10:00.083 --> 10:01.291
When's the last time
you saw him?

10:01.375 --> 10:03.333
[sighs]
That'd be hard to forget.

10:06.750 --> 10:08.667
(Max)
'Hey, Tully, get in line.'

10:08.750 --> 10:10.291
Alright, come on,
I'm buying.

10:10.375 --> 10:14.166
Get an anchor and globe or,
uh,
maybe one of them hula girls.

10:14.250 --> 10:16.000
(Jimmy)
'I ain't got
time, Max.'

10:20.917 --> 10:23.000
Those Navy squids don't
do
so well on land.

10:23.083 --> 10:24.333
I'll say.

10:30.166 --> 10:31.375
Valentine red.

10:33.792 --> 10:35.250
Color of your lips.

10:36.792 --> 10:37.834
Thanks.

10:39.208 --> 10:40.875
I've gotta dash.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.375
Hey, Tully, what the hell
you gawking at?

10:46.458 --> 10:48.542
See that?

10:48.625 --> 10:50.750
Yeah, I sure did.

10:50.834 --> 10:53.166
'Another barnacle looking
to latch onto some sailor.'

10:53.250 --> 10:55.000
'Man, the girls I told
you about at this place'

10:55.083 --> 10:56.959
do a whole lot more
than just look, baby.

10:57.041 --> 10:58.291
'You coming?'

10:58.375 --> 10:59.834
What, are you kidding?

10:59.917 --> 11:01.333
Just met the girl of my dreams.

11:01.417 --> 11:04.208
Hey, anybody want to see
the Liberty Bell with me?

11:04.291 --> 11:06.583
Yeah. Dumbbell
meets Liberty Bell.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.083
Take it easy on the kid, Max.

11:08.166 --> 11:09.542
You know, good thing
you got old Tully here

11:09.625 --> 11:11.250
always sticking up
for you, Snowball.

11:11.333 --> 11:14.250
Maybe he can, um, chaperone
your little sightseeing tour.

11:14.333 --> 11:15.625
(Jimmy)
'I'm going across the
street.'

11:15.709 --> 11:18.166
Hey, no, no,
that's a Navy bar.

11:18.250 --> 11:20.083
Karnow's got to be sore
about you beating him.

11:20.166 --> 11:22.917
Yeah, well, I beat him
fair and square.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.417
Where I'm going,
at least you won't have

11:24.500 --> 11:27.417
to fight sailors off
just to get a dance.

11:27.500 --> 11:28.667
You know where
to find me, punchy.

11:28.750 --> 11:30.458
Roger that, devil dog.

11:33.333 --> 11:36.792
Tattoo was the last thing
I remember about shore leave.

11:36.875 --> 11:40.291
Almost didn't make it back
to the ship due to the
whiskey..

11:40.375 --> 11:41.750
...and a redheaded girl.

11:41.834 --> 11:44.792
This Karnow,
he and Tully have a history?

11:44.875 --> 11:46.583
"Mean Gene" Karnow.

11:46.667 --> 11:49.792
Tully gave that bastard
a really good pasting

11:49.875 --> 11:53.291
at a smoker right before
we got our liberty passes.

11:53.375 --> 11:54.959
Fight over what?

11:55.041 --> 11:57.542
Boxing match over
bragging rights.

11:57.625 --> 11:59.792
Tully always took
<i>Semper Fi</i>

11:59.875 --> 12:02.875
"always faithful"
business seriously.

12:02.959 --> 12:04.083
Me, on the other hand..

12:04.166 --> 12:06.125
Karnow the type
to hold a
grudge?

12:06.208 --> 12:07.959
Well, first off,
he was a Swabbie.

12:08.041 --> 12:11.041
No love lost
between Marines and sailors.

12:20.208 --> 12:21.792
(Nick)
'Gene Karnow?'

12:23.834 --> 12:26.125
Easy. Take it
easy
there, Dragnet.

12:28.542 --> 12:30.083
You guys looking for lessons?

12:30.166 --> 12:31.917
We're here
about Jimmy
Tully.

12:33.625 --> 12:36.208
- What's he want, a rematch?
- He's dead.

12:36.291 --> 12:38.625
Killed on shore leave,
the night he knocked you out.

12:38.709 --> 12:40.000
How'd that happen?

12:40.083 --> 12:42.125
We were just about to ask you
the same question.

12:42.208 --> 12:43.625
You think I killed
him
because he got

12:43.709 --> 12:45.000
over a few lucky punches?

12:45.083 --> 12:47.291
So no hard feelings
between you and
Tully?

12:47.375 --> 12:50.291
Hell, that match with
Tully
and me on board ship

12:50.375 --> 12:52.333
but, that was my last fight.

12:52.417 --> 12:54.500
Boiler blew up
on the way to
Korea

12:54.583 --> 12:58.041
and drove a six-inch piece
of steel into my shoulder.

12:59.417 --> 13:01.333
Jab wasn't much good
after that.

13:01.417 --> 13:03.083
- You see Tully that night?
- Yeah.

13:03.166 --> 13:04.625
[chuckles]
Sure.

13:04.709 --> 13:08.792
Guy had brass ones,
walking into a Navy
bar.

13:32.875 --> 13:34.375
You got lucky, jarhead.

13:35.917 --> 13:38.000
- I don't want any trouble.
- Yeah, what do you want
then?

13:38.083 --> 13:39.125
A dance.

13:42.500 --> 13:43.875
Good luck and goodnight.

13:43.959 --> 13:46.542
She's shot down every sailor
in here including yours truly.

13:46.625 --> 13:48.000
I'll take my chances.

13:55.959 --> 13:57.458
You lost this.

13:57.542 --> 14:00.166
"Brown, Sanford and
Mullins
Attorneys at Law."

14:01.291 --> 14:03.375
So which one are you?

14:03.458 --> 14:05.208
I'm just a stenographer
right now.

14:05.291 --> 14:07.291
Tomorrow's my first
day on the job.

14:07.375 --> 14:11.166
But someday I'm gonna have
my own card just like that.

14:11.250 --> 14:13.083
I'd offer to buy you a
drink
but it looks like you're
doing

14:13.166 --> 14:14.625
just fine in
that
department.

14:14.709 --> 14:16.834
You wanna buy me a drink,
you gotta get in line.

14:18.250 --> 14:19.458
The sailor at the
end
of the bar says

14:19.542 --> 14:21.834
you're the
toughest
thing in here.

14:21.917 --> 14:24.125
Think he might've been right.

14:24.208 --> 14:27.250
I thought Marines
were supposed to be brave.

14:27.333 --> 14:30.583
Well, a good
Marine
must improvise

14:30.667 --> 14:33.333
adapt and overcome.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.208
Is that why
you're in a Navy bar?

14:37.291 --> 14:39.250
The one thing I swore I'd
do
before I shipped off

14:39.333 --> 14:41.291
was dance
with a pretty
girl.

14:41.375 --> 14:43.417
- Is that where I come in?
- Affirmative.

14:47.875 --> 14:50.291
Alright, but I don't dance
with strangers.

14:50.375 --> 14:52.583
Jimmy Tully,
Wilkes Barre,
Pennsylvania.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.834
Nora Lee,
Philadelphia born and bred.

14:56.917 --> 14:59.500
Miss Nora Lee
from Philadelphia, born and
bred

14:59.583 --> 15:00.875
would you care to dance?

15:05.583 --> 15:07.000
Why don't you drop
anchor
someplace else?

15:07.083 --> 15:08.125
You got a problem, pal?

15:08.208 --> 15:09.834
Besides you guys
taking over our
bars

15:09.917 --> 15:11.500
and bird-dogging our women?

15:11.583 --> 15:12.959
Not tonight.

15:16.125 --> 15:18.959
You better have a lot of
bullets
in that gun, civilian.

15:20.417 --> 15:22.333
(Ray)
Get off me.

15:22.417 --> 15:25.750
Never thought I'd be
defending a jarhead's
right

15:25.834 --> 15:28.000
to dance with the
prettiest
girl in the bar.

15:28.083 --> 15:29.667
This tough guy,
he got a name?

15:29.750 --> 15:32.041
Nah, didn't bother asking.

15:32.125 --> 15:33.959
Introduced him
to the sidewalk pretty
good.

15:34.041 --> 15:36.750
Well, maybe he waited
around outside for
Tully.

15:36.834 --> 15:40.041
I couldn't tell
you,
because the second

15:40.125 --> 15:43.458
prettiest girl in
the bar
was so impressed

15:43.542 --> 15:46.041
with my bravery,
she asked me to dance.

15:46.125 --> 15:48.625
Been together 55 years.

15:48.709 --> 15:50.208
You remember anything else
about this guy?

15:50.291 --> 15:54.667
Yeah, had a dock workers'
union patch on his jacket.

15:54.750 --> 15:56.250
That's a funny
thing to remember.

15:56.333 --> 15:58.625
I was a snipe, you
know,
an engine room rat.

15:58.709 --> 16:01.375
I had to deal with sand
crabs
like that all the time.

16:02.417 --> 16:03.709
Thanks for your time.

16:03.792 --> 16:05.375
You know,
if you ever want some
lessons

16:05.458 --> 16:08.083
come on down
and we'll lace 'em up,
okay?

16:08.166 --> 16:10.542
My partner needs
more than that.

16:10.625 --> 16:13.500
You're what, 50 push-ups
from the cover of GQ?

16:13.583 --> 16:16.041
I wouldn't be so sure
about that, big fella.

16:16.125 --> 16:17.583
I could teach him
something that'd wipe

16:17.667 --> 16:19.583
that smirk right off
your face.

16:21.166 --> 16:24.125
Oh, no offense,
detective. Sorry.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.625
Come on, come on..

16:30.709 --> 16:32.208
Come on. Let's go

16:32.291 --> 16:33.875
(Lilly)
'Gunwale, your old haunt?'

16:33.959 --> 16:35.917
(John)
Navy bar, tied
a few on here.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.125
Some things never change.

16:37.208 --> 16:38.834
I'll bet she still remembers
what I drink.

16:41.667 --> 16:45.250
John, long time no see.

16:45.333 --> 16:47.750
Irish whiskey and a beer back?

16:47.834 --> 16:49.041
(John)
'Nah, on duty.'

16:49.125 --> 16:51.583
- This is Detective Rush.
- 'Hey.'

16:51.667 --> 16:54.250
We're wondering
if you remember Jimmy Tully.

16:54.333 --> 16:55.875
Marine back in '51.

16:55.959 --> 16:58.583
I'm good, sugar,
but I'm not that
good.

16:58.667 --> 17:02.083
Witness said he had words over
a girl with a local tough guy.

17:02.166 --> 17:04.208
In the Gunwale?
Imagine that.

17:04.291 --> 17:06.583
That tough guy wore
a dock workers' union patch

17:06.667 --> 17:09.417
on his jacket.
Flashed a gun.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.000
Could be Ray Lisi.

17:11.083 --> 17:12.792
'Hall of fame jackass.'

17:12.875 --> 17:15.625
86'd him from the Gunwale,
over a decade ago.

17:15.709 --> 17:16.834
He ever do time?

17:16.917 --> 17:18.750
He did a good stretch
at Frackville

17:18.834 --> 17:21.000
for beating a union scab.

17:21.083 --> 17:24.291
The guy's sucking his meals
down
through a straw now.

17:24.375 --> 17:25.959
Where's Lisi
park at these
days?

17:26.041 --> 17:29.166
Over at Ruby's with the rest
of his old dock buddies.

17:29.250 --> 17:30.917
'Probably already
got his drunk on.'

17:31.000 --> 17:34.417
And he likes cops
even less than Marines.

17:34.500 --> 17:35.792
We'll keep that in mind.

17:35.875 --> 17:38.208
- Thanks, Sue.
- Okay.

17:38.291 --> 17:39.625
Hey.

17:39.709 --> 17:43.000
He tries to throw a
bottle
at you, like he did
me..

17:43.083 --> 17:44.709
We'll return the favor.

17:50.417 --> 17:52.542
Boss, think I made
some headway

17:52.625 --> 17:54.083
on the oil drum
Tully was found in.

17:54.166 --> 17:55.458
What do you got?

17:55.542 --> 17:57.792
List of about 50 entities
that could've dumped there.

17:57.875 --> 18:00.208
Of the most interest,
the Navy and the shipyard.

18:00.291 --> 18:01.583
Oil drum could
have
come off a ship.

18:01.667 --> 18:03.750
- Yep.
- Check naval base records.

18:03.834 --> 18:06.291
When I served, the military
kept
a paper trail a mile long

18:06.375 --> 18:08.375
for every belt
buckle,
bullet and mess
kit.

18:08.458 --> 18:09.500
Oh, joy.

18:10.667 --> 18:12.375
Oh! So where's
this old dock
worker?

18:12.458 --> 18:14.333
I hear he took a swing
at the cop that picked him
up.

18:14.417 --> 18:17.291
Ray Lisi? Scotty's got him
in the box now.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.792
(Scotty)
'I'm gonna make you
pick up after yourself,
Ray.'

18:22.875 --> 18:25.500
You mind telling me
what this is all about,
junior?

18:26.542 --> 18:28.583
Sure, pops.
Either you tell me about

18:28.667 --> 18:31.834
the last time
you saw Jimmy Tully..

18:31.917 --> 18:34.333
...or I lock you up
for taking a swing at that
cop.

18:34.417 --> 18:35.834
Jimmy who?

18:35.917 --> 18:37.750
We got an eyewitness
says you flashed a gun at him.

18:37.834 --> 18:39.125
Oh, that's interesting.

18:39.208 --> 18:42.208
It gets better, see,
'cause this Marine got shot.

18:43.750 --> 18:45.709
Well, isn't that
what they sign up
for?

18:48.792 --> 18:49.917
Pulled your sheet.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.208
'You beat a guy
with a .38'

18:51.291 --> 18:52.667
'not long after
Tully disappeared.'

18:52.750 --> 18:54.083
It's the same caliber
killed Tully.

18:54.166 --> 18:57.125
Guy was a scab.
He kept falling on my
gun.

18:57.208 --> 18:58.625
Lucky I didn't
pull the
trigger.

18:58.709 --> 19:01.417
Well, you couldn't beat
Tully,
so you shot him.

19:01.500 --> 19:02.709
Keep trawling.

19:03.875 --> 19:06.166
I'm done with you, Ray.

19:06.250 --> 19:09.041
Either you talk or a few
friends
of that cop you swung at

19:09.125 --> 19:11.417
are gonna come in here
and tuck you in for the
night.

19:14.125 --> 19:17.083
Lucky bastard was
doing
just fine when I left
him.

19:25.291 --> 19:26.875
(Nora)
'Greatest city in the
world.'

19:26.959 --> 19:28.792
(Jimmy)
'A lot of guys on
the ship from Philly.'

19:28.875 --> 19:32.333
'Maybe I'll make it
my home someday, too.'

19:32.417 --> 19:34.083
Oh, it's already 10 o'clock.

19:34.166 --> 19:35.375
I'm sorry, I'm keeping you

19:35.458 --> 19:38.291
with your big
first day tomorrow.

19:38.375 --> 19:41.166
My friend dragged me
along with her

19:41.250 --> 19:43.250
and I wasn't expecting
to meet someone like
you.

19:43.333 --> 19:44.792
I know, me neither.

19:44.875 --> 19:47.250
We got those clumsy sailors
to thank for that.

19:47.333 --> 19:50.291
You probably would've found some
other pretty girl to dance with.

19:50.375 --> 19:52.166
But I found you.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.083
What's the matter?

19:57.166 --> 19:59.125
Aren't you afraid
of going over
there?

19:59.208 --> 20:01.041
Marines aren't supposed
to show fear.

20:01.125 --> 20:03.417
Save the slogans
for your buddies.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.041
I'm serious, Jimmy.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.625
Look, any guy who tells you
he isn't afraid is a liar.

20:10.709 --> 20:13.208
'My father served,
and so did his father.'

20:13.291 --> 20:15.166
It's what the men
in my family do.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.208
Hey.

20:21.750 --> 20:25.291
What if I lose you,
as soon as I found you?

20:28.959 --> 20:30.667
I still owe you
that dance, remember?

20:30.750 --> 20:33.208
Dance marathon?
Now you're talking.

20:33.291 --> 20:35.291
Marine and fastest typist
in the steno pool?

20:35.375 --> 20:37.166
We'll be the couple to beat.

20:37.250 --> 20:40.125
- Nora!
- What is it with this guy?

20:40.208 --> 20:42.542
He works down at the docks with
my father. I can handle him.

20:42.625 --> 20:45.542
If he lays one finger on you,
I'm gonna clean his clock.

20:48.208 --> 20:50.083
What're you doing, Ray?

20:50.166 --> 20:52.208
This guy's not gonna
be here for you like I
am.

20:52.291 --> 20:53.834
I appreciate you
looking out for me

20:53.917 --> 20:55.875
but you need to go home.

20:55.959 --> 20:58.166
Please. Do it for me.

21:07.542 --> 21:09.875
Oh, I never been much
for that lovey-dovey
crud

21:09.959 --> 21:13.208
but...I think
she was real
smitten.

21:13.291 --> 21:15.875
You don't strike me
as the observant type, Ray.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.291
I did not shoot that jarhead.

21:19.375 --> 21:20.792
Well, he embarrassed you
in front of your girl.

21:20.875 --> 21:22.250
She wasn't my girl.

21:22.333 --> 21:24.542
The most she ever did
was let me buy her a drink.

21:28.291 --> 21:30.083
Better hope
she backs that up.

21:38.417 --> 21:39.917
(Lilly)
'Your husband?'

21:40.000 --> 21:42.375
I lost him ten years ago.

21:42.458 --> 21:44.917
Ben was a good man.
He was there for me.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.333
Don't make men
like they used to.

21:47.417 --> 21:49.917
Was Tully around
when you started dating Ben?

21:50.000 --> 21:53.375
I know what you're thinking,
but I wasn't that kind of
girl.

21:53.458 --> 21:56.959
I met Ben a year later.
A friend set us up.

22:00.291 --> 22:03.291
- That's my son, Peter.
- Handsome.

22:03.375 --> 22:05.667
I thought you wanted
to ask me about Jimmy Tully.

22:05.750 --> 22:08.625
A guy named Ray Lisi
said you were with Jimmy

22:08.709 --> 22:10.041
the night he disappeared.

22:10.125 --> 22:11.625
We met at the Gunwale.

22:11.709 --> 22:14.125
Then hit a dance marathon.

22:14.208 --> 22:17.917
"Marine and fastest typist
in the steno pool."

22:18.000 --> 22:19.083
'That's what he said.'

22:19.166 --> 22:22.125
- What about after that?
- After that?

22:22.208 --> 22:26.458
I would've given him my heart
but fate wouldn't have it.

22:34.333 --> 22:35.667
What?

22:35.750 --> 22:38.417
Just seeing if your boyfriend
Ray comes out to stop me.

22:38.500 --> 22:40.417
Stop you from what?

22:40.500 --> 22:43.083
Smuggling you
on the ship.

22:43.166 --> 22:45.250
'Come on, I'll buy
you a soda.'

22:45.333 --> 22:47.125
Thank you.

22:49.667 --> 22:51.417
I sure am gonna
miss you.

22:51.500 --> 22:54.458
You'll forget what I look like
minute the ship leaves port.

22:54.542 --> 22:57.041
Not if you give me
a photo of
yourself.

22:57.125 --> 22:58.458
Do I look like
the kind of girl

22:58.542 --> 23:00.709
who carries photos
of herself around?

23:03.041 --> 23:05.125
Come on, let's fix that.

23:05.208 --> 23:07.709
[laughs]
Come on. Come on.

23:19.709 --> 23:21.250
You're supposed to
look at the camera.

23:21.333 --> 23:23.000
What if
I don't want to?

23:23.083 --> 23:24.709
We're going to have
to keep doing this

23:24.792 --> 23:26.083
until you get it right.

23:26.166 --> 23:27.709
Or we could do this.

23:38.750 --> 23:40.709
Private First
Class Tully?

23:40.792 --> 23:41.875
(Jimmy)
'Yes?'

23:41.959 --> 23:43.250
Need to come with us.

23:43.333 --> 23:45.667
Jimmy? Jimmy?
What's happening?

23:45.750 --> 23:47.333
I don't know.

23:47.417 --> 23:48.792
I'll find you.

23:58.792 --> 24:00.083
That was the last time
I saw him.

24:00.166 --> 24:02.166
What did shore
patrol
want with Tully?

24:02.250 --> 24:03.917
I don't know.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.542
He never came back.

24:08.208 --> 24:11.834
Anything else you
remember,
give us a call.

24:11.917 --> 24:14.458
Thank you for letting me know
what happened to him.

24:14.542 --> 24:16.166
'I only knew Jimmy
for a few hours'

24:16.250 --> 24:18.750
but I never forgot him.

24:25.458 --> 24:26.959
Hey, John,
naval clerk dug up

24:27.041 --> 24:28.875
the ship's
disciplinary log book.

24:28.959 --> 24:30.875
Logbook have an entry
of sending out shore
patrol?

24:30.959 --> 24:32.625
Yeah, sent to question Tully's
entire platoon.

24:32.709 --> 24:34.125
Log entry said
they were looking

24:34.208 --> 24:37.000
for a Private First Class
Lenny Snow suspected of taking

24:37.083 --> 24:39.834
a Navy officer's
pearl-handled .38 revolver.

24:39.917 --> 24:41.250
Could be our
murder weapon.

24:41.333 --> 24:42.834
Gun was never recovered.

24:42.917 --> 24:45.000
Snow spent the crossing
to the Korean Peninsula

24:45.083 --> 24:47.166
below decks
in the ship's
brig.

24:47.250 --> 24:48.542
Well, let's put him
in our box

24:48.625 --> 24:51.208
see what he's got to say
about this gun.

24:54.834 --> 24:56.709
Had a look
at your service record.

24:56.792 --> 25:00.083
'Navy Cross, Bronze Star.'

25:00.166 --> 25:02.208
'That's some tour of duty.'

25:02.291 --> 25:04.208
I prefer not
to talk about it.

25:08.083 --> 25:10.750
- Why not?
- Did you serve, detective?

25:12.291 --> 25:14.208
Navy.

25:14.291 --> 25:16.917
- Vietnam?
- River Rat unit.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.792
Then you know a lot
of good men never made it back.

25:20.875 --> 25:23.000
'Doesn't seem right to be
making a fuss over a bunch'

25:23.083 --> 25:24.667
of medals and ribbons.

25:26.041 --> 25:28.500
I did what I had to do.
Others gave more.

25:28.583 --> 25:30.625
You straightened yourself out
after shore leave, though.

25:30.709 --> 25:33.583
(Lenny)
'I'll admit I wasn't the most
squared-away Marine in my
unit.'

25:33.667 --> 25:36.041
But I didn't take
that officer's weapon.

25:36.125 --> 25:38.417
Then why'd shore patrol
think you did?

25:38.500 --> 25:40.667
Oh, I got blamed for everything.

25:40.750 --> 25:43.000
Didn't help that Sergeant
Chaney
had it in for me.

25:43.083 --> 25:44.917
Well, you see Tully
that night on shore leave?

25:45.000 --> 25:46.583
Yeah.

25:46.667 --> 25:49.792
Tried to help me out of the
pickle I was in with that
gun.

26:03.625 --> 26:05.000
(Jimmy)
'Where the hell
have you been?'

26:05.083 --> 26:07.041
I been looking
all over town for you.

26:08.709 --> 26:10.125
- I'm in trouble.
- 'Yeah, I know.'

26:10.208 --> 26:11.792
Shore patrol gave me
the third degree about you.

26:11.875 --> 26:15.250
I didn't take that revolver.
You gotta believe me.

26:15.333 --> 26:17.458
Then you better start
convincing me.

26:17.542 --> 26:18.917
'Cause I just left
the girl of my dreams.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.667
I don't know what happened.

26:20.750 --> 26:21.959
Sergeant Chaney
had Max and me

26:22.041 --> 26:23.750
on police detail
in officer quarters.

26:23.834 --> 26:25.166
You and Max?

26:25.250 --> 26:27.333
You can ask him.

26:27.417 --> 26:30.000
I never even
saw the weapon.

26:30.083 --> 26:32.750
- Scout's honor.
- You see Max go inside?

26:32.834 --> 26:35.667
He wanted to see how squared
away an officer kept his rack.

26:35.750 --> 26:38.500
'You know Max.
He was just jokin' around.'

26:39.834 --> 26:42.750
- You think Max took it?
- If you didn't.

26:44.250 --> 26:46.834
What's it matter?
Huh?

26:46.917 --> 26:49.458
Sarge is right,
I'll never be a good Marine.

26:50.583 --> 26:53.000
You got more guts
than half of these guys.

26:53.083 --> 26:54.166
'I don't care
what sarge says.'

26:54.250 --> 26:55.583
How you figure that?

26:55.667 --> 26:58.500
You lied about your age
to get into the Corps.

26:58.583 --> 27:01.166
I know a lot of guys who lied
so they wouldn't have to
serve.

27:03.041 --> 27:05.417
Why are you so nice
to me, Tully? Huh?

27:07.291 --> 27:09.500
You remind me
of my kid brother, I
guess.

27:12.625 --> 27:16.417
- Memphis?
- Only place I could
think of.

27:16.500 --> 27:19.792
If you run now,
you'll never stop
running.

27:19.875 --> 27:21.500
- I don't know, Tully.
- I'm gonna find Max.

27:21.583 --> 27:23.417
I'm gonna make this right.

27:23.500 --> 27:25.166
So you can
either
get on that bus

27:25.250 --> 27:26.709
or you can go
back
to the ship

27:26.792 --> 27:28.875
'you can look Sergeant Chaney
in the eyes'

27:28.959 --> 27:30.375
and you can
tell him the truth.

27:31.709 --> 27:33.542
'The choice is yours.'

27:42.250 --> 27:44.125
Hardest thing I ever did..

27:44.208 --> 27:46.083
...not getting on that bus.

27:46.166 --> 27:47.709
Shore patrol was waiting

27:47.792 --> 27:49.250
threw me right
in the brig.

27:50.667 --> 27:52.667
So, when'd you hear
Tully went AWOL?

27:52.750 --> 27:55.542
Oh, that's halfway to Korea,
one of the guards told me.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.458
It didn't make
a lot of sense, though.

27:58.542 --> 28:00.750
You know if Tully found Max
that night?

28:00.834 --> 28:02.250
I don't know.

28:02.333 --> 28:04.875
But if Tully gave you
his word on something..

28:04.959 --> 28:06.792
...pretty much meant
it was gonna happen.

28:08.709 --> 28:11.625
He wasn't just
an outstanding Marine..

28:11.709 --> 28:13.583
...he was like
a brother to me.

28:15.417 --> 28:16.834
<i>"Semper Fi."</i>

28:20.000 --> 28:21.875
Spic and Span time, Max.

28:21.959 --> 28:23.709
You lied to us
about seeing Tully.

28:23.792 --> 28:25.208
I said I didn't remember.

28:25.291 --> 28:27.750
That amnesia extend to
taking
that officer's gun?

28:27.834 --> 28:30.125
You were going to let Snow
swing for that.

28:30.208 --> 28:32.375
Only Tully wasn't going
to let that happen.

28:32.458 --> 28:33.959
(Lilly)
'He was going
to turn you in'

28:34.041 --> 28:35.875
so you shot him
before
he had the chance.

28:35.959 --> 28:39.291
- You got it all wrong.
- You took that officer's
gun.

28:39.375 --> 28:41.291
And that's conduct
unbecoming the Corps.

28:41.375 --> 28:43.750
So is shooting a guy who was
just trying to help a friend.

28:43.834 --> 28:45.166
I'm guilty
of a lot of
things

28:45.250 --> 28:47.625
being a bad Marine
is just one of 'em.

28:47.709 --> 28:49.458
But you can't say
the same about
Tully.

28:49.542 --> 28:52.583
He was some
top-shelf
stuff.

29:05.500 --> 29:06.959
(Max)
'Hey, it's punchy!'

29:07.041 --> 29:08.834
Give me the weapon, Max.

29:08.917 --> 29:10.000
Don't know what
you're
talking about.

29:10.083 --> 29:11.625
Cut the crap.
Snow told me.

29:11.709 --> 29:13.959
Ah. You gonna rat me out?

29:14.041 --> 29:16.500
Of course not.
But I need it back.

29:16.583 --> 29:18.417
It was a joke..

29:18.500 --> 29:20.542
...to mess
with Lieutenant
Putnam.

29:20.625 --> 29:23.250
Make him think he lost
his precious revolver.

29:23.333 --> 29:24.375
A joke?

29:24.458 --> 29:25.834
You know, Snow's thinkin'
about going AWOL

29:25.917 --> 29:27.375
because he can't face
Sergeant Chaney.

29:27.458 --> 29:28.875
That sound funny
to you?

29:28.959 --> 29:32.500
Best thing for our platoon
would
be for that guy to wash out.

29:32.583 --> 29:33.583
You're wrong about him.

29:33.667 --> 29:36.333
That guy's a
walking
mortar magnet.

29:36.417 --> 29:39.333
Don't waste your last
hours
of shore leave on Snow.

29:39.417 --> 29:41.458
Just give me the weapon, Max.

29:41.542 --> 29:43.250
I can't. I pawned it.

29:44.834 --> 29:46.667
How do you think
I met these friendly
ladies?

29:46.750 --> 29:48.542
60 bucks?

29:48.625 --> 29:50.750
How am I supposed
to get that kind of money?

29:50.834 --> 29:52.583
- How much you got?
- Ten.

29:52.667 --> 29:55.875
I was gonna use it to buy
something special for Nora.

29:55.959 --> 29:59.458
Don't worry.
Hi. I'll chip in.

30:07.834 --> 30:09.083
I'm not proud of what I did

30:09.166 --> 30:11.208
but I never saw Tully
with that pistol.

30:11.291 --> 30:13.542
So he doesn't show
for the boat ride to Korea

30:13.625 --> 30:14.750
and you don't say a word?

30:14.834 --> 30:16.917
I thought maybe he took off
with that girl

30:17.000 --> 30:18.333
he was so hot
to get back to.

30:18.417 --> 30:22.542
It's what I'd have done.
Back when I could run.

30:22.625 --> 30:25.417
We've got a gun, but no one
who saw Tully with it.

30:25.500 --> 30:28.750
So Tully leaves Max and
what,
gets the gun out of hock?

30:28.834 --> 30:30.709
But he'd need money
for that.

30:30.792 --> 30:32.166
I think I know
where he got
it.

30:32.250 --> 30:33.750
Tully did find
Nora
later that night.

30:33.834 --> 30:34.959
How do you figure?

30:35.041 --> 30:36.583
Well, something
wasn't
sitting right

30:36.667 --> 30:39.250
so I checked into Ben
Conlin,
Nora's late husband.

30:39.333 --> 30:40.583
- The Navy officer.
- Yeah.

30:40.667 --> 30:41.875
Thought if I
could put him

30:41.959 --> 30:44.542
and Tully in town
at the same time..

30:44.625 --> 30:46.417
But he was stationed
in Japan.

30:46.500 --> 30:48.834
Yeah, a dead end
till I found
this.

30:51.750 --> 30:55.750
Ben Conlin adopted Nora
Lee's
three month old baby boy.

30:57.166 --> 30:58.417
A month after
they got married.

30:58.500 --> 31:00.834
Birth certificate lists
the father as "unknown."

31:00.917 --> 31:03.417
Yeah.
Math points to Tully

31:03.500 --> 31:06.333
and their romance didn't end
in that photo booth.

31:11.792 --> 31:15.834
1952, tough time
to be an unwed
mother.

31:15.917 --> 31:17.417
The looks you
must've
gotten.

31:17.500 --> 31:19.083
I don't know
what you're talking about.

31:19.166 --> 31:23.000
Come on, Nora, you didn't meet
Ben till after Peter was born.

31:23.083 --> 31:25.750
Peter...is Tully's son.

31:27.709 --> 31:29.291
'Got the records
to prove it.'

31:33.000 --> 31:35.291
I've never told anyone.

31:35.375 --> 31:36.959
Not even Peter.

31:37.041 --> 31:38.583
You lied about
seeing Tully again.

31:38.667 --> 31:41.250
Makes it hard for me to
believe
anything you say now.

31:41.333 --> 31:42.625
What choice did I have?

31:42.709 --> 31:44.792
So I start thinking,
maybe Tully does go AWOL

31:44.875 --> 31:47.959
then he finds out you're
pregnant and wants to leave
you.

31:48.041 --> 31:49.542
No. You can check.

31:49.625 --> 31:53.291
I wrote letters, filed
paternity
requests with the VA.

31:53.375 --> 31:54.917
I didn't know
where Jimmy was,
either.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.750
Then tell me what happened.

32:00.041 --> 32:03.083
I waited all night
for him to come
back

32:03.166 --> 32:06.041
staring out my
window,
praying to God.

32:07.125 --> 32:09.667
And then, there he was.

32:20.583 --> 32:21.667
Nora.

32:21.750 --> 32:24.041
Oh, I never thought
I'd see you again.

32:28.875 --> 32:30.667
What's bothering you, Jimmy?

32:30.750 --> 32:33.333
Nothing. It's just..

32:33.417 --> 32:34.583
I'm here.

32:34.667 --> 32:37.417
What happened
with shore patrol? Spill.

32:37.500 --> 32:39.667
I just want to make the most
of our last hours together.

32:39.750 --> 32:41.792
Just let me
look at you.

32:41.875 --> 32:43.333
You gotta be
straight with me.

32:43.417 --> 32:44.875
Something's eating at you.

32:46.542 --> 32:49.083
They're looking
for a friend of
mine.

32:49.166 --> 32:51.083
A friend who didn't do
what they're saying he
did.

32:52.917 --> 32:55.208
And, uh,
I tried to help him.

32:57.041 --> 32:59.709
- I couldn't.
- Why couldn't you?

32:59.792 --> 33:02.625
Because I don't have the
money
to prove he's innocent.

33:02.709 --> 33:04.166
And if you had
the money

33:04.250 --> 33:06.583
you could use it
to help your friend?

33:08.625 --> 33:10.542
Look, if I help him..

33:10.625 --> 33:12.375
...and he dies over there..

33:12.458 --> 33:14.917
You don't know
the future.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.709
You can only follow your gut

33:16.792 --> 33:19.917
like you did following me
into that bar and..

33:20.000 --> 33:22.291
...pestering me
for a dance.

33:24.417 --> 33:27.750
I can be pretty
persistent
when I need to be.

33:35.667 --> 33:37.083
What is this?

33:37.166 --> 33:40.333
My mother wore it on her
wedding
day. It's gotta be worth more

33:40.417 --> 33:41.500
than whatever's behind
that pawn ticket.

33:41.583 --> 33:42.625
Nora, I can't--

33:42.709 --> 33:44.417
I don't wanna hear
another word.

33:50.959 --> 33:52.625
Look, it's not worth a lot

33:52.709 --> 33:56.125
but, it's been in my
family
for a long time.

33:59.667 --> 34:02.583
- Will you keep this for me?
- Yes.

34:04.959 --> 34:07.625
I'll be waiting for you at
the docks, before we push
off.

34:10.542 --> 34:11.834
Wait, wait.

34:16.000 --> 34:21.500
I waited by the docks to
see
him one last time but..

34:21.583 --> 34:23.000
Tully didn't leave you..

34:24.208 --> 34:25.667
...he was taken from you.

34:27.792 --> 34:29.458
He was a special man.

34:30.959 --> 34:33.125
One look and I knew
what he was made of.

34:37.542 --> 34:40.208
I want his family
to have this.

34:49.125 --> 34:51.834
This will mean a lot
to his kid brother, Steve.

34:55.125 --> 34:56.250
Detective Rush..

34:57.750 --> 34:59.667
...Jimmy was
the love of my
life.

35:01.417 --> 35:03.500
Thank you for
giving
that back to me.

35:08.792 --> 35:11.709
So, Tully uses Nora's necklace
to get the gun out of hock.

35:11.792 --> 35:13.083
And Tully was
a hard
charger.

35:13.166 --> 35:14.458
Goes back to the
ship,
puts the weapon

35:14.542 --> 35:16.208
back in Putnam's
locker
or returns it

35:16.291 --> 35:17.709
to his platoon sergeant.

35:17.792 --> 35:20.000
Tough play, either way.

35:20.083 --> 35:23.083
He digs, he scores.
You were right, boss.

35:23.166 --> 35:25.417
Military doesn't buy a tin
of beans or toss a grenade

35:25.500 --> 35:26.834
unless there's a paper trail.

35:26.917 --> 35:29.291
De-requisition order
to dispose

35:29.375 --> 35:32.417
of six steel oil drums
of hazardous material

35:32.500 --> 35:34.291
<i>Pronto.</i>

35:34.375 --> 35:36.917
September ninth.
Date matches up.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.834
Stuff like that
doesn't
get on or off a
ship

35:38.917 --> 35:40.500
without the engine
room knowing about
it.

35:40.583 --> 35:43.834
Hmm. "Mean Gene" Karnow
was a machinist mate.

35:43.917 --> 35:45.875
Throw this wrench at
him,
see how he answers.

35:45.959 --> 35:47.583
This supposed
to mean something?

35:47.667 --> 35:49.208
(Nick)
Well, the date's of
interest.

35:49.291 --> 35:52.333
Especially seeing as how
Tully's
body was found in an oil drum.

35:52.417 --> 35:53.667
Right, the Marine.

35:53.750 --> 35:55.041
You remember
this order?

35:55.125 --> 35:56.750
Yeah, I come back
from, uh, shore leave

35:56.834 --> 35:59.250
and there's, uh, a Marine
sergeant screaming at me

35:59.333 --> 36:01.333
to get rid of the waste
oil drums ASAP.

36:01.417 --> 36:04.667
I tell him I don't take
orders
from a jarhead.

36:04.750 --> 36:08.208
Navy ship, Navy engine room.

36:08.291 --> 36:09.917
You refused
to dump those drums?

36:10.000 --> 36:11.208
Yeah, and in about ten minutes

36:11.291 --> 36:13.125
my chief comes down
and chews me out

36:13.208 --> 36:14.792
so I go ahead
and get rid of 'em.

36:14.875 --> 36:17.583
This Marine sergeant,
his name by any chance Chaney?

36:17.667 --> 36:20.667
Yeah, that's him.
Thought he was all hard

36:20.750 --> 36:22.375
but then we get out
to rough seas

36:22.458 --> 36:26.250
he's out back puking
his guts out over the rail.

36:26.333 --> 36:27.542
Chaney.

36:30.500 --> 36:31.667
Took a look at your medical

36:31.750 --> 36:34.458
and service record books,
Sergeant Chaney.

36:34.542 --> 36:37.875
Spent most of your second tour
in the field hospitals.

36:37.959 --> 36:39.417
Significant battle fatigue?

36:39.500 --> 36:42.667
You ask me down here to
question my service record?

36:42.750 --> 36:46.166
[chuckling]
You're way out
of your depth, son.

36:46.250 --> 36:47.750
Something must have been
eating at you real bad

36:47.834 --> 36:50.250
'cause you never saw any action
during your second tour.

36:50.333 --> 36:52.834
You want to ask me
something about Tully, ask it

36:52.917 --> 36:55.583
but I will not sit
here and have you question

36:55.667 --> 36:58.125
my service to this country.

36:58.208 --> 36:59.625
This interview is over.

37:00.917 --> 37:03.333
If you want, we can
cuff
you to that chair.

37:12.375 --> 37:14.875
I had an officer like you,
a ball-busting son of a
bitch.

37:14.959 --> 37:16.208
'I hated that bastard.'

37:18.000 --> 37:19.542
But when it was said and done
he just wanted

37:19.625 --> 37:20.917
what was best for his men.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.458
- He had a code.
- Best ones do.

37:23.542 --> 37:25.959
Is that why you were trying
to wash out PFC Snow?

37:27.917 --> 37:29.625
What the hell does
this have to do with Snow?

37:29.709 --> 37:30.917
Answer the question!

37:31.000 --> 37:32.834
Snow didn't belong
in the Marines!

37:32.917 --> 37:34.917
And it was your job
to sort men like him.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.500
Snow was going
to fill up his boots

37:36.583 --> 37:38.291
the very minute
he saw those Chinamen

37:38.375 --> 37:39.458
'coming at
us in waves.'

37:39.542 --> 37:41.458
Oh, with all due respect, sir

37:41.542 --> 37:43.291
you were wrong
about Snow, dead wrong.

37:43.375 --> 37:45.458
He was 15 years old.

37:45.542 --> 37:47.959
'He wanted to be a Marine
so bad he lied about his
age.'

37:48.041 --> 37:49.834
You buried him
behind a desk

37:49.917 --> 37:51.375
and he still made it
to the front line.

37:51.458 --> 37:53.500
Awarded the Bronze Star
and Navy Cross.

37:53.583 --> 37:56.333
That's a lot of bull.
Snow did no such
thing.

37:56.417 --> 37:59.583
Account of Private First
Class
Lenny Snow's

37:59.667 --> 38:01.583
heroic actions during battle.

38:01.667 --> 38:04.000
While you were cooling
your heels in a field
hospital

38:04.083 --> 38:06.333
this is what
a brave Marine was doing.

38:06.417 --> 38:08.000
"During a sudden enemy ambush

38:08.083 --> 38:13.208
"Private First Class Snow
unhesitatingly left his
foxhole'

38:13.291 --> 38:16.083
"moved through withering fire,
and employing his rifle

38:16.166 --> 38:17.625
"inflicted numerous casualties.

38:17.709 --> 38:20.792
"His actions saved the lives
of his fellow Marines."

38:21.625 --> 38:23.542
I will not listen to this.

38:23.625 --> 38:25.166
Snow was going to get us all
killed over there.

38:25.250 --> 38:28.500
I should know.
I've seen it before.

38:28.583 --> 38:31.166
Lenny Snow exemplified
the Marine Corps.

38:31.250 --> 38:32.500
Negative!

38:32.583 --> 38:34.917
Then just when you think
you got Snow going AWOL

38:35.000 --> 38:36.583
Tully shows up
to plead his
case

38:36.667 --> 38:38.417
says he knows
Lenny didn't take that gun.

38:38.500 --> 38:40.333
- Tully was wrong.
- Not about Snow.

38:40.417 --> 38:42.166
He wasn't and you know it.

38:44.709 --> 38:47.542
You're still a
Marine.
Act like one.

38:47.625 --> 38:50.375
Son of a bitch
wouldn't back down.

38:50.458 --> 38:52.333
He threatened
to pull rank on me.

38:53.333 --> 38:54.583
On me!

38:55.792 --> 38:58.375
This better be good, Tully.

38:58.458 --> 39:00.542
Getting me out of the rack
at this time of night.

39:00.625 --> 39:02.083
Sir.

39:02.166 --> 39:05.000
PFC Snow did not take
Lieutenant
Putnam's revolver, sir.

39:05.083 --> 39:07.542
- Where did you get this,
Tully?
- I cannot say, sir.

39:07.625 --> 39:09.125
I didn't copy that.

39:10.959 --> 39:12.792
You will give me that weapon.
That is an order.

39:12.875 --> 39:15.166
Sir, I wish only to
clear
Private Snow's name.

39:16.333 --> 39:20.417
PFC Snow is not worthy
of being a Marine.

39:20.500 --> 39:23.041
Snow is a coward and a thief
and will not tarnish

39:23.125 --> 39:24.542
the Marine Corps
with his presence.

39:24.625 --> 39:27.583
With all due
respect
to Sergeant Chaney

39:27.667 --> 39:30.166
PFC Snow is neither
a coward nor a
thief.

39:30.250 --> 39:32.458
You have no idea
what it takes to be a Marine.

39:32.542 --> 39:35.458
PFC Snow believes you are
trying to wash him out,
sir

39:35.542 --> 39:38.000
something that is
against
Marine Corps tradition.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.417
Do not lecture me
about tradition!

39:43.709 --> 39:46.208
Now, you will stand down
and give me that weapon.

39:47.834 --> 39:48.875
I can't do that, sir.

39:48.959 --> 39:51.875
You are disobeying orders,
PFC Tully!

39:54.041 --> 39:55.291
You will give me
that weapon

39:55.375 --> 39:57.875
and you will tell me
where PFC Snow is

39:57.959 --> 40:00.291
or I will see to it that
your sorry butt is booted back

40:00.375 --> 40:02.792
to whatever ungrateful hole
you crawled out of.

40:02.875 --> 40:04.792
Sergeant, I am prepared

40:04.875 --> 40:06.875
to go to Captain
Ryan
and tell him the
truth.

40:06.959 --> 40:08.083
The truth?

40:09.375 --> 40:11.041
And what truth is that?

40:11.125 --> 40:12.458
That you wish
to pin the
theft

40:12.542 --> 40:14.458
of an officer's
weapon
on an innocent man.

40:24.709 --> 40:26.250
You will do no such thing.

40:27.959 --> 40:31.125
'Cause I decide which Marines
remain in this platoon.

40:31.208 --> 40:32.834
Me and only me.

40:32.917 --> 40:35.083
- Sir, I can't let you do
that.
- You..

40:39.625 --> 40:41.041
Sergeant, please.
