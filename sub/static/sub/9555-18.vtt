<i>What do you think of this?</i>

01:26.553 --> 01:29.215
Jefferson,
Jefferson, Jefferson High,

01:29.356 --> 01:31.916
You can beat this team,
don't settle for a tie.

01:32.059 --> 01:34.118
You got them on the run,
you got them in a spin,

01:34.261 --> 01:36.457
so grab that ball
and win, win, win!

01:36.597 --> 01:38.793
(cheering)

01:38.932 --> 01:41.230
(whooping)

01:49.843 --> 01:52.141
You're all too kind.

01:52.279 --> 01:53.644
Hi, Fonz.
Uh, bye, Fonz.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.680
The game starts in two hours.

01:55.816 --> 01:58.649
- Oh, yeah!
- We barely have time to flirt.

02:00.921 --> 02:03.947
Hey, uh, Al, listen,
I got a ten-minute lunch.

02:04.091 --> 02:07.186
Yeah, I'm tuning up
a bookmobile. Very stacked.

02:07.327 --> 02:10.627
- Lots of books?
- Lots of librarians.

02:10.764 --> 02:14.291
What you need is
my famous hit-and-run special.

02:14.434 --> 02:17.233
Clarence!
Give me a hit, hit, hit...

02:17.371 --> 02:20.363
Al. Run, run, run, run.

02:21.642 --> 02:24.168
(quietly):
Jefferson, Jefferson...

02:24.311 --> 02:26.177
Here you go, Fonz.
Bon appetit.

02:26.313 --> 02:28.782
There is no parsley
on this plate.

02:28.915 --> 02:31.213
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry. I forgot.

02:31.351 --> 02:33.115
And, uh, not the canned kind.

02:33.253 --> 02:35.745
My body needs fresh.

02:35.889 --> 02:38.483
- Here you go, Fonz.
- Thank you.

02:38.625 --> 02:39.888
Why do you eat that stuff?

02:40.027 --> 02:42.496
Why does Popeye eat spinach?

02:42.629 --> 02:45.621
- Let me try one.
- Go right ahead.

02:46.967 --> 02:48.594
AL:
Mm. I'll stick to spinach.

02:48.735 --> 02:50.897
Al, I got great news.

02:52.906 --> 02:54.431
Fonz...

02:54.574 --> 02:56.975
uh... Fonz,
I have got the greatest news.

02:57.110 --> 02:58.976
I got a ten-minute lunch.
Talk fast.

02:59.112 --> 03:01.171
Oh, sure. Oh, parsley. Hey.

03:01.314 --> 03:03.840
Fonz, I got a job.

03:03.984 --> 03:05.076
On a newspaper.

03:05.218 --> 03:07.050
<i>Milwaukee Shoppers News.</i>

03:07.187 --> 03:08.518
Hey, that's terrific.
You gonna write up front,

03:08.655 --> 03:10.214
like on the front page
or something like that?

03:10.357 --> 03:12.826
Well, uh,
a-a little further back.

03:12.959 --> 03:14.688
The obituaries?

03:14.828 --> 03:16.728
Not that, no.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.558
It's gonna be great experience.

03:18.699 --> 03:19.598
They're not paying you, huh?

03:19.733 --> 03:21.258
Well, no.

03:21.401 --> 03:23.233
But, Fonz, a lot of people
are gonna read it,

03:23.370 --> 03:24.997
and it could lead
to bigger things for me.

03:25.138 --> 03:26.799
It's sort of an advice column.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.032
What kind?

03:28.175 --> 03:29.074
"Ask Aunt Fanny."

03:29.209 --> 03:30.301
I'm asking you.

03:30.444 --> 03:32.708
No, that's what it is, Fonz.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.814
It's an advice-
to-the-lovelorn column.

03:34.948 --> 03:35.813
I knew that.

03:35.949 --> 03:37.940
And I'm, uh...

03:40.520 --> 03:42.921
I'm Aunt Fanny.

03:44.291 --> 03:46.157
- No...
- Yeah.

03:46.293 --> 03:47.658
Well, it's just for two weeks.

03:47.794 --> 03:49.819
Aunt Fanny's in Mexico
getting a divorce.

03:51.765 --> 03:54.063
Uncle Fanny got caught cheating?

03:54.201 --> 03:55.430
(chuckles):
Yeah.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.435
This is really
my big break, Fonz. I mean...

03:57.571 --> 03:59.437
Well, you see,
if I could impress the editor,

03:59.573 --> 04:01.871
then I'd probably get
a column of my own, you know,

04:02.008 --> 04:05.205
and then I'd go syndicated...
and my own TV show.

04:05.345 --> 04:07.814
Who knows?
It happened to Ed Sullivan.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.814
(like Ed Sullivan):
This is Richie Cunningham.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.816
Right here on our stage tonight

04:11.952 --> 04:15.616
we have the entire population
of Belgium with their pets.

04:15.756 --> 04:18.281
Sit down, Mr. Broadway.

04:18.425 --> 04:20.189
- When do you start?
- Well, I already started.

04:20.327 --> 04:21.589
I've already done
my first column.

04:21.728 --> 04:24.823
Matter of fact,
listen to this, Fonz.

04:24.965 --> 04:27.627
"Dear Aunt Fanny..."
- Yeah, that's good.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.202
RICHIE:
There's more.

04:29.336 --> 04:31.134
"...my husband likes
to show off at parties

04:31.271 --> 04:33.035
by eating dog biscuits..."

04:34.207 --> 04:36.198
That saves
on the hors d'oeuvres.

04:36.343 --> 04:38.903
Yeah, well,
that's not the problem.

04:39.045 --> 04:42.379
"Now, I know dog biscuits aren't
good for him, but what can I do?

04:42.516 --> 04:44.507
Signed, Concerned Wife."

04:44.651 --> 04:46.244
- What'd you tell him?
- Mm.

04:47.888 --> 04:51.381
"If you want a happy marriage,
let your husband have his fun.

04:51.525 --> 04:55.120
And check him for fleas
once a month."

04:56.797 --> 04:58.788
Here's another one.

05:01.468 --> 05:02.663
"Dear Aunt Fanny,

05:02.803 --> 05:04.669
"I'm an attractive girl of 18,

05:04.805 --> 05:06.864
"but haven't had
a lot of dating experience.

05:07.007 --> 05:08.236
"What can I do?

05:08.375 --> 05:10.673
Signed, Puckered but Depressed."

05:10.811 --> 05:13.678
I'll handle that one.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.213
Well, that's, uh...

05:15.348 --> 05:18.010
yeah, that's more or less
the advice I gave her.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.346
Fonz, one favor.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.147
Don't tell anybody, okay?

05:21.288 --> 05:23.655
Humble. I love humble!

05:23.790 --> 05:25.280
Yeah, I'm-I'm humble.

05:25.425 --> 05:26.984
That, and, uh...

05:27.127 --> 05:29.391
Aunt Fanny told me she'd fire me
if I said anything.

05:29.529 --> 05:31.224
- FONZIE: I understand.
- Yeah.

05:31.364 --> 05:33.298
Oh, I got to phone in
my deadline.

05:33.433 --> 05:34.696
That's newspaper talk.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.065
Fonz, would you mind if I use
the phone in your office?

05:37.204 --> 05:39.639
- Knock yourself out.
- Great. Thanks a lot.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.339
All right, all right.

05:43.476 --> 05:45.467
All right, Malph...

05:47.047 --> 05:48.572
Okay, Malph.

05:48.715 --> 05:50.046
All right, if you're
not gonna make lunch,

05:50.183 --> 05:51.582
I'm gonna eat here.
It was your turn!

05:51.718 --> 05:53.846
I couldn't fix lunch-- I was
looking for the showerhead!

05:53.987 --> 05:55.955
Ah. You mean this thing?

05:56.990 --> 05:58.355
- You had it!
- Yeah.

05:58.491 --> 05:59.720
All right, hand it over, Pots.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.988
- Not until you give me back
my lava lamp. -Forget it.

06:02.128 --> 06:04.597
- I'll just go home and take
a nice long bath. -Oh, yeah?

06:04.731 --> 06:06.426
- Without water?
-(laughs)

06:06.566 --> 06:07.727
No problem.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.632
I'll just stuff the drain
with your new shirt.

06:09.769 --> 06:10.998
You better not touch
my new shirt, Malph.

06:11.137 --> 06:12.104
The pants are going in, too.

06:12.239 --> 06:13.434
Oh, I'd like to see you
get my pants.

06:13.573 --> 06:14.699
- Oh, come on, Pots...
- Who do you think you are...?

06:14.841 --> 06:17.139
Hold it! You guys are terrible
for the digestion.

06:17.277 --> 06:18.745
What is this, a slumber party?

06:18.879 --> 06:21.211
No, Fonz, we're fighting again.

06:21.348 --> 06:22.406
Always. You're always fighting.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.039
Not always.
Just when we're together.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.153
- We need a referee.
- Yeah.

06:27.287 --> 06:29.517
- What am I wearing, a striped
shirt and a whistle? -Aw, Fonz,

06:29.656 --> 06:31.283
we got to talk to somebody--
we need advice.

06:31.424 --> 06:32.892
- Expert advice.
We need an expert. -Yeah.

06:33.026 --> 06:33.993
- You need an expert?
- Yeah.

06:34.127 --> 06:36.960
- I know an expert.
- You do? -Who?

06:37.097 --> 06:39.498
Why don't you...
ask Aunt Fanny?

06:39.633 --> 06:41.260
(chuckles)

06:44.471 --> 06:48.169
<i>JOANIE: Why do I have to wear
one of Fat Phyllis's dresses?</i>

06:48.308 --> 06:51.175
<i>MARION: Dear,
your cousin Phyllis is not fat.</i>

06:51.311 --> 06:53.405
Anyway, when I get this
cut down, you're gonna have

06:53.546 --> 06:56.140
a new dress and I'm gonna have a
set of kitchen curtains.

06:56.283 --> 06:59.651
But, Mom, everyone will know
this is her dress.

06:59.786 --> 07:02.619
No, they won't, dear.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.087
JOANIE:
It'll look like a tent.

07:04.224 --> 07:08.058
There's a, uh, a bookmobile
parked in the driveway.

07:09.229 --> 07:10.754
Oh, that's nice, dear.

07:10.897 --> 07:13.195
Did you have a nice day
at school?

07:13.333 --> 07:16.064
Mom, college is not school.

07:16.202 --> 07:18.432
Fat Phyllis's dress, huh?

07:18.571 --> 07:20.198
Mom...

07:23.043 --> 07:25.705
- Daddy's home! Yeah.
- Hi, Dad.

07:25.845 --> 07:27.540
I hope you're satisfied, Marion.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.547
You have made me
the laughingstock

07:29.683 --> 07:31.811
-of the whole neighborhood.
- Heh! Not for long.

07:31.952 --> 07:34.182
Wait until they get a load
of this dress.

07:34.321 --> 07:35.686
Well, what's wrong, Howard?

07:35.822 --> 07:37.517
What's wrong?
I'll tell you what's wrong.

07:37.657 --> 07:39.386
It's the letter you wrote
to Aunt Fanny!

07:39.526 --> 07:41.494
- You wrote a letter
to Aunt Fanny? -HOWARD: Yeah.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.653
No, she wouldn't write a letter
to Aunt Fanny.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.095
Oh, no? Well,
you just listen to this.

07:46.232 --> 07:48.200
"Dear Aunt Fanny,

07:48.335 --> 07:51.032

"but he hides Tootsie Rolls
in his cash register

07:54.474 --> 07:58.035
"and tells everyone
they're rolls of dirty nickels.

07:59.579 --> 08:02.378
"What can I do
to keep him on his diet?

"Signed...

08:05.819 --> 08:07.412
Ooh!

08:07.554 --> 08:10.546
Sure caught you, Mom--
there it is in black and white.

08:10.690 --> 08:13.159
- Howard, I didn't write
that letter. -You didn't?

08:13.293 --> 08:14.590
No, of course not.

08:14.728 --> 08:17.163
Ah. She didn't write a letter
to Aunt Fanny. Heh.

08:17.297 --> 08:19.288
Well, everyone at the store
thinks she did.

08:19.432 --> 08:21.298
I mean, when I left,
they were singing,

08:21.434 --> 08:24.597

08:24.738 --> 08:27.105
Oh! Oh, that's a good one,
that really is.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.641
No, that's... that's
not a good one, Marion.

08:29.776 --> 08:33.337
- Mm. No.
- You, get out of my chair.

08:33.480 --> 08:36.381
Oh, you're wearing
Fat Phyllis's dress.

08:36.515 --> 08:37.984
That's it!
That's it, Mom.

08:38.118 --> 08:41.349
You can make yourself
two sets of curtains.

08:41.488 --> 08:44.082
Howard, what am
I gonna do with her?

08:44.224 --> 08:46.192
Maybe you should write a letter
to <i>Aunt</i> Fanny.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.727
Aunt Fanny is full of malarkey.

08:48.862 --> 08:52.127
Dear, she's somebody's aunt--
she must know something.

08:53.500 --> 08:56.663
Well, I'm gonna go and fix
Fat Phyllis's dress now.

08:56.803 --> 08:58.328
Dad, I've read that column,

08:58.471 --> 09:00.496
and I think she gives
very sound advice.

09:00.640 --> 09:01.801
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

09:01.941 --> 09:03.534
Well, just listen to this one.

09:03.676 --> 09:07.442
"Dear Aunt Fanny, we used
to get along just great,

09:07.580 --> 09:10.413
"but now we fight all the time.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.576
"We try to respect
each other's rights,

09:13.720 --> 09:17.554
"but it's very hard to know
where to draw the line.

Signed, Troubled Twosome."

09:22.328 --> 09:25.923
Now, there is a young couple
that desperately needs help.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.932
I think you'll find that answer
very helpful.

09:28.068 --> 09:31.663
Helpful? It's frivolous.
It could do more harm than good.

09:33.840 --> 09:34.705
<i>- RALPH: Isn't.
- Is.</i>

09:34.841 --> 09:35.706
<i>Isn't!</i>

09:35.842 --> 09:37.071
So we agreed that Aunt Fanny's

09:37.210 --> 09:38.837
-gonna settle this thing
for us, right? -Right.

09:38.978 --> 09:42.414
Okay, then let's call a truce
until we read what she says.

09:42.549 --> 09:44.643
- All right. A truce
in five seconds. -All right.

09:44.784 --> 09:46.479
- Five, four...
- Three, two...

09:46.619 --> 09:48.018
Do you always have
to interrupt me, Malph?

09:48.154 --> 09:50.145
- Is the truce on or isn't it?!
- One. Truce is on!

09:50.290 --> 09:51.883
All right, no more yelling,
no more getting excited

09:52.025 --> 09:53.424
-till we hear from Aunt Fanny,
right? -Right!

09:53.560 --> 09:55.551
- All right!
- All right.

10:00.733 --> 10:02.599
I think I'll clean up, Pots.

10:02.735 --> 10:04.760
I mean, you made the din-din.

10:04.904 --> 10:06.429
Thank you, Malph.

10:06.573 --> 10:08.564
You're welcome.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.049
I really appreciate
your thoughtfulness.

10:17.183 --> 10:19.208
And I appreciate
your appreciation

10:19.352 --> 10:21.343
of my thoughtfulness.

10:21.488 --> 10:24.185
Why, thank you.
I really appreciate that.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.315
See that, Potsie?
See how nice it is

10:26.459 --> 10:30.293
when two people can carry on
an adult conversation like this.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.920
It certainly is.

10:32.065 --> 10:33.362
And may I also add

10:33.500 --> 10:35.832
that you certainly are a whiz
in the kitchen.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.097
Oh, thank you kindly.

10:38.238 --> 10:39.535
What was that vegetable
you served?

10:39.672 --> 10:40.935
Refried beets.

10:41.074 --> 10:43.168
Yum, yum, yum.

10:43.309 --> 10:44.674
Yeah.

10:44.811 --> 10:47.007
And I love
your pork chops, Chef.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.478
Oh, a very special recipe.

10:48.615 --> 10:50.310
Pork chops
stuffed with peanuts.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.509
Great, great, just great.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.177
- Yeah. -I would have
preferred them shelled,

10:54.320 --> 10:56.516
-but who's complaining?
-(knocking)

10:56.656 --> 10:57.589
Oh, I'll get it.

10:57.724 --> 10:59.192
No, I'll get it, Pots.
You relax.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.726
Why, thank you, Malph.

11:01.861 --> 11:03.659
Huh.

11:03.796 --> 11:06.288
- Chachi!
- Hey, Ralph. Hey, Pots.

11:06.432 --> 11:08.924
_l-low you doing?
_l-low you doing...?

11:09.068 --> 11:11.662
You guys are hitting each other
with pots now, huh?

11:11.804 --> 11:14.330
No, no. I haven't hit Pots
with a pot all week.

11:14.474 --> 11:15.566
Yeah, good one, that's good.

11:15.708 --> 11:17.699
Yeah, even in a truce I got it.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.710
That's right, Chach,
we called a truce

11:19.846 --> 11:21.712
till we get professional help.

11:21.848 --> 11:23.441
Hey, that's great.
Oh, by the way,

11:23.583 --> 11:25.677
my mother sent me down
to collect the rent.

11:25.818 --> 11:28.981
And, look, this time she
doesn't want it all in pennies.

11:29.122 --> 11:30.419
(Ralph chuckles)

11:30.557 --> 11:32.992
She have something
against Lincoln?

11:33.126 --> 11:35.185
- Here you go. -Thanks, guys.
I'll see you later.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.126
- RALPHIPOTSIE: All right.
- Oh. Almost forgot.

11:37.263 --> 11:38.253
I brought your mail.

11:38.398 --> 11:39.559
- Oh, thanks, Chach.
- Oh, great.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.929
- I have this real heavy date,
you know? -Mm-hmm.

11:42.068 --> 11:43.866
But I took the time because...

11:44.003 --> 11:45.562
well, you guys are worth it.

11:45.705 --> 11:46.570
No tip, Chach.

11:46.706 --> 11:47.935
It's probably bills.

11:48.074 --> 11:50.168
<i>- The Milwaukee Shoppers News.
- Oh, give it over here.</i>

11:50.310 --> 11:51.744
Not so fast, Pots.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.539
This is C.O.D.

11:53.680 --> 11:56.081
And you guys know what
C.0.D. means, don't you?

11:56.216 --> 11:58.810
Yeah. C.O.D.--
Chachi Out Door.

11:58.952 --> 12:01.444

- Come on, guys.

12:01.588 --> 12:03.488
- Thanks for the lift.
- Bye.

12:03.623 --> 12:05.648
Come on. We got
our professional advice.

12:05.792 --> 12:07.123
- Okay.
- All right.

12:07.260 --> 12:08.523
Wait a minute, Potsie...

12:08.661 --> 12:10.129
before we read it, remember,

12:10.263 --> 12:12.823
whatever she says
is what we're gonna do. Agreed?

12:12.966 --> 12:13.990
- Ag reed.
- Okay.

12:14.133 --> 12:15.225
All right. Heh.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.735
Here we go.
"Dear Troubled Twosome..."

12:17.870 --> 12:20.669

12:20.807 --> 12:23.139
"So you don't know
where to draw the line.

12:23.276 --> 12:27.543
Easy. Draw it
down the middle of the room."

12:27.680 --> 12:30.672
Down the middle of the room.

12:30.817 --> 12:32.683
She's absolutely right.

12:32.819 --> 12:35.151
Yeah. Why didn't we

Aunt Fanny didn't say
anything about trading.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.349
Yeah, yeah, I-I-I know.

14:44.484 --> 14:47.146
He's in his office.
I'll go get him.

14:48.755 --> 14:50.018
I know. She's here.

14:50.156 --> 14:52.887
Holy moly, Fonz,
how'd you know a girl was here?

14:53.025 --> 14:55.790
My leather jacket
started to quiver.

14:55.928 --> 14:58.920
Quivering. That reminds me--
my Jell-O's ready.

15:05.004 --> 15:06.062
Fonzie... Oh.

15:06.205 --> 15:08.139
Fonz... Fonzie,
I got to talk to you.

15:08.274 --> 15:09.298
It's important.

15:09.442 --> 15:11.103
Later. Trudy here's
a "libarian."

15:11.244 --> 15:14.475
I got to get her back;
she's overdue.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.609
Fonzie, please, this can't wait.

15:17.750 --> 15:22.415
All right. Put a bookmark
where we were so I don't forget.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.523
I won't forget.

15:24.657 --> 15:27.092
-(snaps fingers)
- Conversate with me.

15:27.226 --> 15:29.160
Oh, Fonz...

15:29.295 --> 15:31.161
What's the matter
with you, Chachi?

15:31.297 --> 15:33.459
I haven't had a good
night's sleep in a week.

15:33.599 --> 15:36.034
Hey, I'm very proud of you, huh?

15:36.169 --> 15:39.230
No, Fonz, you don't understand--
you see, it's Ralph and Potsie.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.466
- Yeah.
- They're fighting again.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.575
Day and night, day and night.

15:43.709 --> 15:45.108
Well, mostly night.

15:45.244 --> 15:47.838
What a misuse of darkness.

15:47.980 --> 15:49.311
No, Fonz,
this time it's serious.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.577
Would you believe these two guys
are talkin' splitsville?

15:51.717 --> 15:53.913
And just because some...
some dummy gave 'em advice?

15:54.053 --> 15:55.452
- What dummy, huh?
- Aunt Fanny.

15:55.588 --> 15:57.056
Uh-oh.

Interesting, Mom.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.777
Uh... what is it?

16:18.911 --> 16:21.278
I read in "Aunt Fanny"
a wife should serve something

16:21.414 --> 16:22.540
completely different

16:22.682 --> 16:25.014
to brighten up
her family's meals.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.412
- Hey, I'm sorry I'm late,
you know? -Arthur.

16:28.554 --> 16:31.216
I just renewed
my "liberry" card.

16:32.758 --> 16:34.749
Oh. Conference time.

16:34.894 --> 16:37.795
Uh, couldn't it wait
a second, Fonz? Uh...

16:37.930 --> 16:41.093
Somebody's aunt is on thin ice.

16:42.134 --> 16:43.101
- Aunt?
-(Fonzie snaps fingers)

16:43.236 --> 16:45.671
Uh, conference time.

16:45.805 --> 16:49.207
You remember a letter that
you wrote to a Troubled Twosome?

16:49.342 --> 16:51.970
Troubled Twosome.
Uh... oh, yeah, yeah,

16:52.111 --> 16:53.670
uh, the husband and the wife.

16:53.813 --> 16:55.372
- No husband, no wife.
- No?

16:55.515 --> 16:56.607
No.

16:56.749 --> 16:58.911
Try a Ralph and a Potsie.

16:59.051 --> 17:00.610
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

17:00.753 --> 17:02.517
No. How bad is it?

17:02.655 --> 17:03.781
- Let's put it this way.
- Yeah?

17:03.923 --> 17:05.288
You're a home wrecker.

17:07.727 --> 17:10.252
Will you clue me in
on what we're having over there?

17:10.396 --> 17:11.693
- Apple surprise.
- What is it?

17:11.830 --> 17:12.763
You got me.

17:12.898 --> 17:14.765
- Mother Kelp.
- That's it, Fonz.

17:14.901 --> 17:16.630
All right,
you're having two of 'em.

17:16.769 --> 17:18.362
I'm only having one.

17:18.503 --> 17:20.165
You're having two of 'em.

17:20.306 --> 17:22.832
Two.

17:22.974 --> 17:26.741
(chuckles): Hey-hey,
how are you? That's great.

17:26.878 --> 17:29.211
Apple surprise!

17:35.187 --> 17:38.384

17:41.794 --> 17:43.592
You don't let up, Pots,
over and over...

17:43.729 --> 17:45.663
Wait a minute,
you don't let up over and ov...

17:45.798 --> 17:47.197
Wait a minute.
You can't come in.

17:47.333 --> 17:48.801
The door's
on my side of the room.

17:48.935 --> 17:51.427
So what? I traded you one shower
for one coming in the door.

17:51.571 --> 17:52.834
And you used it up this morning.

17:52.972 --> 17:55.703
What are you... Malph,
you better not close that...

18:00.580 --> 18:03.106
I see you, Malph.
Get away from my refrigerator!

18:03.249 --> 18:04.648
Aw, come on, Pots,
give me a break.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.218
I haven't had
anything cold in days.

18:06.352 --> 18:08.150
If I get to use your stove.

18:08.287 --> 18:10.312
- Okay, one stovey.
- All right.

18:10.456 --> 18:12.185
RALPH:
Hey! Hey!

18:12.325 --> 18:14.123
Your leg's on my side
of the tape.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.659
I get a trip
to the bathroom for that.

18:15.795 --> 18:18.264
All right, all right. Just
let me cook my dinner, okay?

18:23.636 --> 18:26.162
It's nice to be back home.

18:26.305 --> 18:27.966
Ha-ha-ha.

18:29.141 --> 18:30.836
Yeah.

18:30.977 --> 18:33.241
Ah-ah-ah, your side of the line.

18:33.379 --> 18:35.541
How am I supposed
to cook my dinner, Malph?

18:35.681 --> 18:38.173
Simple. I'll turn on the oven.

18:38.317 --> 18:40.752
I'll even go so far
as to open the door.

18:40.886 --> 18:42.354
Oh, heat.
It's warm already.

18:42.488 --> 18:43.853
All yours, Pots.

18:43.990 --> 18:45.355
What am I supposed to do,
throw it?

18:45.491 --> 18:46.686
Unless you want to mail it.

18:53.065 --> 18:54.692
Oh, look! Look!

18:54.834 --> 18:58.998
I found a TV dinner
on my side of the room.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.197
You give me that dinner back,
Malph, right now!

19:01.340 --> 19:03.206
-(phone ringing)
- You give me that dinner back.

19:03.342 --> 19:04.810
Ah. Ah...

19:04.944 --> 19:08.141
My side, my phone, my slop,

19:08.280 --> 19:11.375
my books, my pictures, my phone.

19:11.517 --> 19:13.952
Hello. Ralph Malph's
side of the room.

19:14.086 --> 19:15.611
Mm-hmm. Yes.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.723
Of course.
It's for you, Pots.

19:17.857 --> 19:18.790
Big deal.

19:18.924 --> 19:20.949
Does she sound gorgeous!

19:21.093 --> 19:22.492
Great! Great!

19:22.628 --> 19:24.460
Uh-uh-uh. Uh-uh.

19:24.597 --> 19:26.292
Oh, Malph, what do you want?

19:26.432 --> 19:28.560
- Three nights in the bed.
- One night.

19:28.701 --> 19:31.398
Hi, my little cupcake.
I'm all yours.

19:31.537 --> 19:32.470
Two nights!

19:32.605 --> 19:33.936
Deal.

19:35.474 --> 19:37.704
Hi, my little cupcake.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.333
Wham?

19:40.713 --> 19:42.238
Wrong number.

19:42.381 --> 19:43.644
All right, Malph, that's it.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.273
Put 'em up.
I've had it with you.

19:45.418 --> 19:47.785
- Come on, put 'em up. Come on.
- If you're gonna threaten me,

19:47.920 --> 19:50.116
-do it from your own side
of the room. -Fine. Fine.

19:50.256 --> 19:52.020
Come on. Come on.
You're over the line, Malph.

19:52.158 --> 19:54.024
- Come on.
- Get your hand back.

19:54.160 --> 19:55.787
Watch the line.
Come on. Come on.

19:55.928 --> 19:57.259
-(knocking)
- It's for me.

19:57.396 --> 19:59.956
- How do you know?
- It's my door.

20:00.099 --> 20:03.865
- Hey, Rich. Come on in.
- Hi, Ralph. Hey, Potsie.

20:04.003 --> 20:07.564
What'd you decide to do, turn
your place into a tennis court?

20:07.707 --> 20:09.004
(chuckles)

20:11.577 --> 20:13.272
We divided the room.

20:13.412 --> 20:15.540
Why'd you do
a stupid thing like that?

20:15.681 --> 20:17.046
Aunt Fanny told us.

20:17.183 --> 20:19.652
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

20:19.785 --> 20:22.049
That woman has a big mouth.

20:22.188 --> 20:24.680
This is my side.
That's what's his name's side.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.189
Hey, Rich...

20:26.325 --> 20:27.952
like a cold drink?

20:28.994 --> 20:30.462
W-Wait a minute, Rich.

20:30.596 --> 20:32.121
Wouldn't you rather have
a hot chocolate?

20:32.264 --> 20:34.198
-(Richie chuckles)
- Yeah, come on, that's...

20:34.333 --> 20:37.359
POTSIE: Hey, Rich, Rich.
Want to go to the bathroom?

20:38.904 --> 20:40.531
Uh, wait a minute,
look, I-l just...

20:40.673 --> 20:42.607
I came here
to tell you guys something.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.211
I can't hear you--
you're not on my side.

20:45.344 --> 20:47.540
All right,
everybody on the line!

20:47.680 --> 20:49.876
- POTSIEIRALPH: Why?
- It's neutral territory.

20:50.015 --> 20:52.279
On the line, right now.
Ralph, Pots, come on.

20:52.418 --> 20:53.886
- RALPH: All right.
- RICHIE: Hurry up.

20:54.019 --> 20:55.953
- POTSIE: Okay, okay.
- Right on the line.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.852
RALPH:
All right, I'm on the line.

20:57.990 --> 20:59.287
Now...

20:59.425 --> 21:01.450
we're all sensible people
here, right?

21:01.594 --> 21:02.686
POTSIE/RALPH:
Right.

21:02.828 --> 21:04.694
You have your differences,
but they can be settled.

21:04.830 --> 21:06.025
- They were settled.
- By Aunt Fanny.

21:06.165 --> 21:07.792
Well, Aunt Fanny--
see, that's what I want

21:07.933 --> 21:09.059
to talk to you about.

21:09.201 --> 21:10.726
- Well?
- Well, uh...

21:10.870 --> 21:13.066
(chuckles): actually,
it's kind of humorous, in a way.

21:13.205 --> 21:14.331
POTSIE:
Ha...

21:14.473 --> 21:15.634
Well, maybe not humorous.

21:15.775 --> 21:19.336
Uh... guys, listen,
life is full of little ironies.

21:19.478 --> 21:22.778
Rich, can you get on with this?
I'm teetering on the line here.

21:27.319 --> 21:30.584
You guys are great,
and working with no net!

21:35.227 --> 21:37.218
Have you told 'em
you're Aunt Fanny yet?

21:41.233 --> 21:43.600
- I was just getting to that,
Fonz. -Good.

21:43.736 --> 21:44.931
What?

21:45.070 --> 21:46.162
You?

21:46.305 --> 21:48.205
You're Aunt Fanny?

21:48.340 --> 21:50.570
Look, I'm-I'm sorry,
I know I was wrong.

21:50.709 --> 21:52.370
Wrrrr...

21:52.511 --> 21:54.809
RICHIE: And I didn't mean
to give out bad advice.

21:54.947 --> 21:56.210
FONZIE:
Didn't mean it.

21:56.348 --> 21:58.612
- But I was trying to impress
my editor. -Impress his editor.

21:58.751 --> 22:01.152
Oh, man. Should've minded
your own business, Rich.

22:01.287 --> 22:02.311
Really.

22:02.454 --> 22:05.014
- Really.
- I know that. I know.

22:05.157 --> 22:07.125
Think it's been easy for me?
It hasn't.

22:07.259 --> 22:09.159
I'll tell you one thing,
from now on,

22:09.295 --> 22:12.321
I'm gonna be much more careful
about what I put in print.

22:12.464 --> 22:13.829
Well, it's all right, Rich.

22:13.966 --> 22:15.331
No, it isn't all right.

22:15.467 --> 22:17.993
There ought to be a law
against impersonating an aunt!

22:18.137 --> 22:20.333
- The man just apologized.
- So look at the trouble he made.

22:20.472 --> 22:21.462
- You are crazy!
- Look at this. Lines down...

22:21.607 --> 22:22.733
(Ralph and Potsie
continue arguing)

22:22.875 --> 22:23.967
-(snaps fingers)
- Whoa!

22:24.109 --> 22:25.838
All right, now...

22:25.978 --> 22:29.004
Grandma Nussbaum always told me,
you got a problem...

22:29.148 --> 22:32.982
there is nothing like going
for a warm, soft bowling ball.

22:33.118 --> 22:34.449
You get my drift?

22:37.623 --> 22:39.614
RALPH:
No, Fonz. What does that mean?

22:39.758 --> 22:41.658
It means you got two choices.

22:41.794 --> 22:44.559
The first--
you want to get along

22:44.697 --> 22:47.223
and you got to argue,
argue quietly,

22:47.366 --> 22:49.130
softly, together.

22:49.268 --> 22:51.532
- Called communication.
- The man is right.

22:51.670 --> 22:54.105
I mean, Aunt Fanny
couldn't say it any better.

22:54.240 --> 22:56.106
What's the second choice?

22:56.242 --> 22:58.370
- Don't ask.
- Well...

22:58.510 --> 23:00.877
you know, Fonz, I-l kind of like
that first choice,

23:01.013 --> 23:03.448
-the communication one.
- Yeah, we can live with that.

23:03.582 --> 23:05.676
- You show good taste.
- Yeah. -Yeah.

23:05.818 --> 23:07.115
-(snaps fingers)
- Let's go, Rich.

23:07.253 --> 23:09.119
- RICHIE: Yeah. -RALPH:
Well, thanks. -POTSIE: See ya.

23:09.255 --> 23:11.747
Right. Fonz, uh,
are we going somewhere?

23:11.891 --> 23:14.451
I am. "Libarian,"
Inspiration Point,

23:14.593 --> 23:16.925
make our own branch.

23:18.464 --> 23:21.229
Guys, one thing's
still bothering me.

23:21.367 --> 23:24.064
Why'd you write to Aunt Fanny
in the first place?

23:24.203 --> 23:26.467
Oh. Yeah, well, someone
suggested we write, Rich.

23:26.605 --> 23:27.766
Yeah.

23:27.907 --> 23:31.207
Well, who'd be dumb enough
to do a thing like that?

23:33.000 --> 23:39.074

23:54.767 --> 23:56.326
Come on, Marion.

23:56.468 --> 23:59.699
We don't want to be late for the
Leopard Lodge Charity Bazaar.

23:59.838 --> 24:02.603
I'll be through
in a minute, dear.

24:04.977 --> 24:08.003
Well, I'm all ready to go.

24:08.147 --> 24:11.242
Joanie! Come on! Hurry up!

24:12.384 --> 24:14.250
I'm all ready.
You want any help?

24:14.386 --> 24:15.854
Oh, thank you so much, dear.

24:15.988 --> 24:17.854
Just get out
the new tablecloth.

24:17.990 --> 24:19.480
Oh.

24:26.598 --> 24:29.260
(chuckles): Hey, I just love
my middle-class family.

24:29.401 --> 24:30.596
You know...

24:30.736 --> 24:31.726
Don't tell me.

24:31.870 --> 24:35.135
Fat cousin Phyllis
outgrew another dress.
