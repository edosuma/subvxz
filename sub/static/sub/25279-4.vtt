00:17.392 --> 00:19.019
How's the dress look?

00:19.937 --> 00:22.564
I don't wanna get married.

00:22.648 --> 00:23.607
It's that bad?

00:23.690 --> 00:26.401
No, I'm serious, Colt.
I wanna postpone the wedding.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.278
No, you... No.

00:28.362 --> 00:29.571
What are you doing?

00:29.655 --> 00:32.115
It's bad luck to see the bride
in the dress before the wedding.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.784
Oh, no! My boob popped out!

00:37.037 --> 00:37.871
Wow.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.082
You look so beautiful.

00:40.165 --> 00:42.751
I ain't even disappointed
your boob ain't out.

00:45.087 --> 00:47.631
I look like a bag of fucking marshmallows.

00:48.799 --> 00:50.509
We're not even getting married
for a month.

00:50.592 --> 00:51.760
It'll only get worse.

00:51.843 --> 00:55.222
Well, I love marshmallows.
They're in a lot of my favorite things:

00:55.305 --> 00:57.641
S'mores, Lucky Charms, Grape-Nuts...

00:59.393 --> 01:02.813
when I put marshmallows in them
'cause all we got is Grape Nuts.

01:03.689 --> 01:05.857
Our wedding is supposed to be
the best day of our lives.

01:05.941 --> 01:08.735
You know what my days are like now.
My feet are swollen.

01:08.819 --> 01:10.654
I have constant backaches.

01:10.737 --> 01:13.824
There's an angry munchkin
using my bladder as a speed bag.

01:15.492 --> 01:18.495
Colt, why don't we get married
after the baby's born?

01:18.579 --> 01:21.582
Whoa. Okay, we've been planning this
for four months, okay?

01:21.665 --> 01:23.792
And you know I don't wanna get married
after the baby comes.

01:23.875 --> 01:25.669
Then it'll be the "B" word.

01:25.752 --> 01:27.796
Okay, you can say "bastard."

01:27.879 --> 01:30.674
Whoa. Not in front of baby Peyton.

01:31.717 --> 01:33.885
You don't even know
if it's a girl or a boy yet.

01:33.969 --> 01:37.681
Only now you understand
the brilliance of the name Peyton.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.100
Look, just...

01:41.643 --> 01:43.770
I want our baby to be born with parents.

01:43.854 --> 01:47.608
What? Whether we're married or not,
we'll still be parents to little Peyton.

01:47.691 --> 01:49.443
Damn it, now I'm doing it.

01:49.526 --> 01:51.612
Look, it's wrong to have a child
out of wedlock.

01:51.695 --> 01:53.989
Oh, God, Colt.

01:54.072 --> 01:58.493
Listen... I've been dreaming
about this day since I was a little girl:

01:58.577 --> 02:02.372
the flower girl spreading rose petals,
my dad walking me down the aisle,

02:02.956 --> 02:04.541
my first dance with you.

02:04.625 --> 02:08.377
And not once did I ever imagine myself
looking like the Michelin Man's mom.

02:09.795 --> 02:10.672
I get it, okay,

02:10.756 --> 02:12.841
but this is the first decision
we're making as parents

02:12.924 --> 02:14.301
and I don't wanna make the wrong one.

02:14.384 --> 02:16.970
Colt, I love you
and I wanna get married. Okay.

02:17.054 --> 02:18.972
But I don't wanna be
some white-trash bride.

02:19.556 --> 02:20.766
I wanna have fun.

02:20.849 --> 02:23.143
I wanna line dance with you
to "Boot Scootin' Boogie,"

02:23.226 --> 02:24.478
and shotgun a beer,

02:24.561 --> 02:27.022
swig Fireball Whisky out of the bottle.

02:27.606 --> 02:30.442
Okay, that, that still sounds
pretty white trash.

02:32.778 --> 02:34.154
I don't wanna get married like this.

02:34.237 --> 02:35.280
Well, I do.

02:35.364 --> 02:37.115
I don't wanna
talk about this anymore.

02:37.199 --> 02:38.867
Well, all right, fine,
when're we gonna talk about it?

02:38.950 --> 02:39.785
After the baby's born.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.453
Fine. Whoa.

02:41.536 --> 02:43.038
I see what you did there.

03:47.728 --> 03:53.066
No, we'll be fine, Mags. Yeah.
Let me know how it goes up there.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.402
All right, talk to you.

04:00.824 --> 04:05.620
Seems like your mom might've found a buyer
for some of Peterson's old equipment.

04:05.704 --> 04:06.538
Nice.

04:07.706 --> 04:10.041
Wait, is she up in Denver?

04:10.125 --> 04:12.794
Is she gonna pass that Lululemon outlet
on the way back?

04:14.629 --> 04:16.005
'Cause I got a list.

04:17.673 --> 04:18.759
You see this?

04:18.841 --> 04:20.635
<i>We're looking at live footage
of two fires...</i>

04:20.719 --> 04:22.888
Oh, shit... Tanya got a haircut.

04:25.307 --> 04:28.268
Man, I'd kill to have that volume.

04:28.894 --> 04:31.354
I'm talking about the wildfire behind her.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.106
<i>At this time, the fire services...</i>

04:33.190 --> 04:38.320
And Tanya cut her hair two weeks ago.
Try to stay up with the news.

04:40.864 --> 04:43.450
I'll tell you, it's kinda hard
to see past Tanya.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.036
Oh!

04:46.119 --> 04:48.622
That fire's blazing out of control.

04:48.705 --> 04:51.166
Yeah, it's up in Montrose County.

04:51.249 --> 04:54.252
If the wind turns south,
it's gonna head straight for us.

04:54.336 --> 04:56.963
Yeah, and if the Democrats get elected,

04:57.047 --> 05:00.842
they're gonna take away our guns
and make the national pastime huggin'.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.555
There ain't never been a fire north of us
that turned south.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.349
Just get the fucking firewood

05:07.432 --> 05:10.018
and everything else
that'll burn away from the house.

05:10.602 --> 05:12.479
And check that gravity line.

05:13.063 --> 05:15.398
We'll figure out what to do
with the cattle when the time comes.

05:15.482 --> 05:16.525
And why don't you get on...

05:16.608 --> 05:20.445
Disc up the field,
and put all the heavy equipment

05:20.529 --> 05:23.657
and the feeders in the middle. I got it.

05:24.241 --> 05:25.075
Great.

05:25.158 --> 05:28.245
Where'd you learn all that ranching stuff?
Lululemon?

05:32.290 --> 05:33.750
Montrose, huh?

05:34.417 --> 05:36.503
It's by the Vossler ranch, innit?

05:37.087 --> 05:39.881
Yeah, they had to evacuate the whole area.

05:39.965 --> 05:43.718
But don't worry. The governor
declared a state of emergency,

05:43.802 --> 05:46.638
and he tweeted out "thoughts and prayers."

05:46.721 --> 05:51.434
It included a little emoji
of hands praying,

05:51.518 --> 05:53.770
so problem solved.

05:56.064 --> 05:58.400
You know what the government ought to
declare a state of emergency?

05:58.984 --> 06:00.569
The government.

06:00.652 --> 06:02.070
That's funny.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.701
Do you really think it's funny?
Or you just making fun of me?

06:09.578 --> 06:12.122
No, it's very funny. Good one.

06:13.915 --> 06:17.252
I know it's funny.
I don't need your validation.

06:20.672 --> 06:22.799
That shit is funny, though, right?

06:26.678 --> 06:27.929
Genny busted?

06:28.680 --> 06:31.224
It's more than busted, dude.
It's gone.

06:32.142 --> 06:34.311
Time of death? Right the fuck now.

06:35.979 --> 06:37.814
All right, I'll take a look at it.

06:40.817 --> 06:42.861
Oh, that you laugh at.

06:44.863 --> 06:46.114
If that fire comes through here,

06:46.197 --> 06:48.992
we're gonna need this generator
to power the pumps,

06:49.075 --> 06:50.744
so figure the damn thing out.

06:51.536 --> 06:53.830
Yeah, that's
a great pep talk, Dad.

06:55.957 --> 06:58.126
It's like that time you took
the training wheels off my bike,

06:58.209 --> 06:59.919
and told me to stop falling down.

07:00.837 --> 07:04.215
When I took that helmet away from you,
you learned to ride it, didn't you?

07:05.258 --> 07:08.970
Yeah, I made it all the way to ER
without falling down.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.848
Dad, look, it's trash.

07:12.849 --> 07:14.392
There's no money for a new generator.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.020
There's no money for anything.

07:17.103 --> 07:20.106
Yeah, well, maybe Colt can come up
with one of them mystery checks.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.025
Yeah. That ain't gonna happen.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.945
Come on, dude. Why don't you tell us
where that check came from?

07:25.528 --> 07:28.698
What happened, uh,
J.J. Watt knock up Abby?

07:31.201 --> 07:33.244
He's paying you to pretend it's yours?

07:34.287 --> 07:35.538
Why would I keep that a secret?

07:37.624 --> 07:39.960
That'd just be fucking awesome!

07:41.294 --> 07:42.796
All right, enough.

07:42.879 --> 07:45.799
I don't care if you have to duct tape it
or super glue it.

07:46.299 --> 07:47.884
Quit whining and fix it.

07:50.178 --> 07:53.932
Same thing he said when I broke my arm
after I fell off my bike.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.521
There's no way they need this many tests.

07:59.604 --> 08:04.025
They've taken so many samples already,
I feel like a goddamn Costco.

08:06.361 --> 08:08.405
Doctors know what they're doing.

08:08.905 --> 08:10.448
Do you think
you know more than the mechanic

08:10.532 --> 08:11.366
when you take your truck in?

08:11.950 --> 08:15.161
Why in the hell would I take my truck
to a mechanic?

08:17.789 --> 08:19.165
Hello, Mr. Bennett.

08:19.249 --> 08:20.750
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.335
Dr. Boyd, this is Joanne.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.297
It's nice to meet you.
I'm impressed he has a female doctor.

08:26.381 --> 08:28.299
That's very open-minded of you.

08:29.968 --> 08:32.929
Her dad died and she's using his name.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.139
She tricked me.

08:36.140 --> 08:38.476
We have the results of your blood work
and things look good.

08:39.059 --> 08:41.938
Well, I'm glad you're able
to tell me that at 3:53

08:42.022 --> 08:44.107
for my three o'clock appointment.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.818
I'm sorry
about the wait.

08:46.901 --> 08:49.154
The good news is
we got your HDL cholesterol up,

08:49.237 --> 08:50.780
but we need to get your LDLs lower.

08:51.364 --> 08:56.494
We also need to get something else on your
waiting room TV other than <i> The View.</i>

08:58.371 --> 08:59.664
Well, the last time you came,

08:59.748 --> 09:03.376
there was a soccer game on
and you called me a communist.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.297
I'd like you to switch statins.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.966
This one targets the LDL a little better.

09:12.427 --> 09:13.595
I got a question for you.

09:14.179 --> 09:15.388
This should be fun.

09:17.474 --> 09:20.101
How much are the crooked
pharmaceutical companies paying you

09:20.185 --> 09:22.812
to hawk this new medication
you're putting me on?

09:23.396 --> 09:24.272
That was fun.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.276
Maybe this will make you feel better.

09:32.864 --> 09:34.157
Oh.

09:35.492 --> 09:37.243
I have to update the seating chart.

09:37.327 --> 09:40.663
Turns out Uncle Gary's coming
to the wedding.

09:40.747 --> 09:44.042
He's bringing his friend.
His male friend.

09:45.710 --> 09:50.965
Don't be surprised if they're dancing...
together.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.469
Ma, they're gay.
We get it.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.764
They don't like to be called gay.

09:57.847 --> 09:59.349
Yes, they do.

10:00.850 --> 10:03.812
I don't know what's PC
to call anybody anymore.

10:03.895 --> 10:05.188
The whole thing's retarded.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.695
Well, if Gary
is coming to the wedding,

10:13.196 --> 10:15.406
don't sit him next to
my opinionated cousin, Bobby.

10:16.407 --> 10:17.742
That's PC for racist.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.872
Also, he don't like the gays.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.668
Oh, before I forget,
I spoke to Father McGinty.

10:26.751 --> 10:30.046
If we're gonna use him,
we've gotta let him know ASAP.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.257
August is his biggest month for funerals.

10:34.759 --> 10:38.138
Some stubborn old folks
just won't put on their AC.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.850
Seventy-eight degrees is fine, Janice.

10:44.060 --> 10:48.273
Can we please just change the subject?
All we ever talk about is the wedding.

10:48.356 --> 10:49.357
Oh.

10:49.440 --> 10:52.777
I'm sorry.
I'm just so excited.

10:52.861 --> 10:55.155
It's just, you're my baby girl, and I...

10:55.238 --> 10:57.407
I wanna give you
the wedding of your dreams.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.243
Yeah, the wedding of my dreams.

11:02.287 --> 11:05.123
All right, look, I'm sorry
I didn't say this sooner, but...

11:06.166 --> 11:08.751
I just, I just, I didn't know how.

11:10.211 --> 11:11.880
I'm gonna have to postpone the wedding.

11:11.963 --> 11:12.964
What?

11:13.047 --> 11:14.090
Colt, I thought we were gonna
talk about this some more.

11:14.173 --> 11:15.300
No, no... All right, look...

11:16.009 --> 11:18.928
I'm sorry. I just...
I got a lot going on right now.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.806
The two ranches,
we gotta get the cattle to market.

11:22.515 --> 11:23.474
We just...

11:24.809 --> 11:26.561
We're gonna have to hold off the wedding
until after the baby.

11:27.478 --> 11:30.607
And you didn't wanna stop
at the drugstore for my Xanax.

11:34.110 --> 11:37.906
So, our grandchild is gonna be born
out of wedlock?

11:37.989 --> 11:41.159
Mr. Philips, Mrs. Phillips...

11:41.242 --> 11:44.913
no matter when this baby's born,
it's gonna have two parents that love it.

11:46.581 --> 11:49.208
Well, I know I won't love it the same.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.754
I can't believe you're doing this.

11:53.338 --> 11:55.882
Especially when I've been
so supportive of you.

11:57.508 --> 11:59.844
- Okay. Hold on, Mom, this isn't...
- Abby, don't.

12:01.471 --> 12:04.265
If your parents are gonna be mad
at someone, let them be mad at me.

12:04.849 --> 12:06.601
Well, you're damn right we're mad.

12:06.684 --> 12:10.897
You know how much energy and time
Janice has put into this wedding?

12:10.980 --> 12:12.231
She made a PowerPoint.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.195
Oh, hi.

12:17.779 --> 12:20.531
You must be the blushing bride's parents.

12:20.615 --> 12:23.576
- It's a pleasure to meet...
- It's not a good time, Hank.

12:24.619 --> 12:25.787
It never is.

12:35.797 --> 12:37.256
Oh, man.

12:40.218 --> 12:41.094
All right... Well,

12:41.177 --> 12:44.389
we'll talk later, at some point.

12:46.391 --> 12:47.475
Probably?

12:50.436 --> 12:52.647
- That was fun.
- Yeah.

12:52.730 --> 12:56.359
I'm glad your dad forgot to turn off
the blinker halfway home.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.905
It drowned out the sound
of your mom sobbing.

13:03.741 --> 13:07.829
Well, I appreciate you taking the bullet
like that for me with my parents.

13:07.912 --> 13:09.455
You didn't have to do that.

13:11.165 --> 13:12.750
That don't change nothin'.

13:13.668 --> 13:15.670
Your dad hated me
ever since our first date

13:15.753 --> 13:17.255
when I showed up and said,

13:17.338 --> 13:19.132
"Thank you
for making your daughter so hot."

13:22.218 --> 13:23.594
Or it may have been

13:23.678 --> 13:27.265
the, uh, Federal Bikini Inspector
T-shirt that you wore?

13:27.765 --> 13:29.559
That's a play on words, babe.

13:29.642 --> 13:34.522
"Federal Bikini Inspector"
instead of "Federal... B-I."

13:35.440 --> 13:37.942
Shh, don't listen to him.
I'll teach you things.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.364
Listen, I've been thinking,

13:43.448 --> 13:46.909
and I know how important it is for you
to be married before the baby comes.

13:47.952 --> 13:49.245
It's important.

13:51.372 --> 13:53.166
But I want you to have
the wedding of your dreams.

13:55.209 --> 13:57.211
Well, how about this?

13:58.171 --> 13:59.338
What if...

14:00.590 --> 14:03.009
we go to the courthouse tomorrow,
you and I, and get married?

14:07.847 --> 14:08.806
Are you serious?

14:09.515 --> 14:13.686
Yeah, and we... we could still
have our big wedding later.

14:16.522 --> 14:20.318
Yeah, I mean, technically we'd be married
before we had the baby.

14:22.737 --> 14:23.696
Hell, yeah!

14:23.780 --> 14:25.990
No... That way we both,
we both get what we want.

14:26.074 --> 14:27.617
It's like a Sleep Number bed.

14:29.744 --> 14:33.498
- Wait. So, do we invite your parents?
- No, we'll tell them after.

14:34.290 --> 14:36.751
Listen, I mean, it'll be great.

14:36.834 --> 14:38.669
We could... we could celebrate
with everyone later

14:38.753 --> 14:40.630
and everyone will be happy
'cause it's official.

14:40.713 --> 14:41.798
Fireball!

14:44.300 --> 14:45.802
Tomorrow will just be our thing.

14:47.011 --> 14:48.388
Yeah...

14:48.471 --> 14:50.431
- I like our things.
- Yeah.

14:51.516 --> 14:55.853
This is like when you do a
crossword puzzle while I am playing Xbox.

14:56.771 --> 14:58.231
Or when you read a book
while I'm playing Xbox.

14:58.314 --> 15:01.192
Or when you play Xbox,

15:01.275 --> 15:02.568
and I see you did something wrong,

15:02.652 --> 15:04.946
but I don't say nothin'
until it's my turn to play Xbox.

15:05.655 --> 15:09.158
Okay, if you could have sex
with an Xbox, would you still be with me?

15:10.243 --> 15:12.537
I'm so excited we're getting married.

15:12.620 --> 15:15.873
Oh, my God! You're so bad!

15:23.673 --> 15:24.715
Look at these people,

15:24.799 --> 15:27.677
waitin' on an emergency
to stock up on supplies.

15:27.760 --> 15:33.099
Well, Beau, not everybody has
three years of beef jerky in their bunker.

15:34.475 --> 15:37.270
Shh. They'll hear you and come for it.

15:38.729 --> 15:41.649
Hey, if I give you some money,
will you buy me some allergy medicine?

15:42.233 --> 15:43.818
Sure. Why can't you?

15:44.402 --> 15:45.862
Well, last time my daughter was in town,

15:45.945 --> 15:50.408
she used my driver's license to buy, like,
40 packs of Sudafed to make meth.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.786
I'm on a list.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.874
I got more guns
than the entire country of Canada.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.500
I'm on no list.

16:01.627 --> 16:03.421
God bless America.

16:05.089 --> 16:08.968
Mr. Bennett, your prescription's ready.
That'll be $130.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.138
Good thing I have insurance.

16:12.722 --> 16:13.848
That's after insurance.

16:14.891 --> 16:18.811
Are you kidding?
130 bucks every month?

16:19.395 --> 16:22.440
What's the point of having insurance
if it doesn't pay for anything?

16:23.024 --> 16:24.108
Keep 'em.

16:24.192 --> 16:27.445
Beau, hey, Beau, Dr. Boyd said
you needed that medicine.

16:28.029 --> 16:29.113
Well, of course she did.

16:29.197 --> 16:32.450
She wants to pay
for that DirecTV soccer package.

16:33.451 --> 16:35.203
Everything isn't a conspiracy.

16:35.286 --> 16:36.913
Oh, hell, they're all in this together:

16:37.497 --> 16:39.916
the doctors, the drug companies,
the insurance providers,

16:40.500 --> 16:42.084
the food industry.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.837
"Please take on a full stomach."
Fuck them.

16:46.339 --> 16:49.133
You sound like those guys
who call into the <i> Rush Limbaugh Show.</i>

16:49.717 --> 16:51.469
I've called Rush Limbaugh.

16:52.595 --> 16:54.805
How the hell
are you supposed to pay for this?

16:54.889 --> 16:56.891
They're trying to screw us
'cause they know they can.

16:56.974 --> 17:00.311
I know it isn't fair,
but what're you gonna do?

17:00.394 --> 17:02.939
If one of your kids needed these pills,
wouldn't you buy 'em?

17:05.566 --> 17:06.526
All right, let's go.

17:08.152 --> 17:09.403
Bullshit.

17:17.994 --> 17:19.204
- Oh, hey.
- What's up?

17:21.040 --> 17:22.708
Do you smell smoke?

17:22.791 --> 17:23.917
Yeah.

17:24.001 --> 17:27.380
News said they're doing
a controlled burn down off the 145.

17:27.463 --> 17:28.881
Don't think it's nothing to worry about.

17:28.965 --> 17:31.092
Yeah, they also said
don't worry about the bird flu,

17:31.175 --> 17:34.887
but I tell you what, I see a pigeon
sneezing, I'm crossing the fucking street.

17:36.597 --> 17:37.473
Hey,

17:37.557 --> 17:39.058
come down to the courthouse tomorrow?

17:39.850 --> 17:41.978
What's the matter,
you got a female judge?

17:42.061 --> 17:43.813
Want me to come down there
and bang her gavel?

17:46.190 --> 17:47.441
Me and Abby's getting married.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.236
We ain't inviting anyone, but...

17:51.320 --> 17:52.863
I want you to come and stand for us.

17:53.447 --> 17:54.574
Yeah, dude. I'd be honored.

17:55.616 --> 17:57.076
What're you doing
bailing on the wedding, though?

17:57.159 --> 17:59.036
You know, you owe me a drunken bridesmaid.

18:00.329 --> 18:03.833
Oh, we're still doing the ceremony.
Just after we have the baby.

18:04.667 --> 18:07.044
Abby wants to get drunk at the wedding.

18:07.128 --> 18:10.464
Plus, the baby can wear one
of those tiny tuxedos.

18:10.548 --> 18:12.425
If you weren't in the wedding,
I'd say he could borrow yours.

18:14.552 --> 18:16.012
Yeah, that's cool.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.138
You know, I'm gonna start buying
your kids cigarettes

18:17.221 --> 18:18.180
when he's like nine, right?

18:19.682 --> 18:22.310
Hey, do me a favor.
Come help me unload this genny.

18:22.393 --> 18:23.728
Yeah, you fix 'er up?

18:28.774 --> 18:29.650
Where'd you get this?

18:30.234 --> 18:32.570
Oh, from this, uh, new generator store
just opened up.

18:32.653 --> 18:34.989
It's called None of Your Fucking Business.

18:35.948 --> 18:38.826
That's the same high school
your pretend girlfriend went to.

18:40.244 --> 18:43.539
No, seriously though, did you steal this?

18:43.623 --> 18:46.626
Oh, dude. Come on, man.
Don't worry about it.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.462
Oh, no. Fuck that, man. You know the rule.

18:50.046 --> 18:53.382
Anything you fit in your pocket
from 7-Eleven's okay:

18:54.175 --> 18:56.510
dip, candy, nachos.

18:57.720 --> 19:00.139
Look, man. We're all doing what
we gotta do to keep the ranch going...

19:00.222 --> 19:02.558
No, no!
We ain't all doing shady shit, man.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.852
Oh, really? Where'd you get that check?

19:05.436 --> 19:06.812
Look, you know I can't tell you.

19:06.896 --> 19:08.522
Well, then I can't tell you
where the generator came from.

19:08.606 --> 19:10.149
No, there's a big difference between

19:10.232 --> 19:12.693
taking a loan from somebody
who wants to help out quietly

19:12.777 --> 19:14.362
and stealing a fucking generator.

19:14.945 --> 19:15.780
What's the difference?

19:15.863 --> 19:18.824
Well, one ends with the phrase
"Pick up the phone.

19:18.908 --> 19:21.494
The man wearing lipstick
behind the glass is your Uncle Rooster."

19:26.248 --> 19:28.834
Dude, I'm solving Dad's problem, okay?

19:28.918 --> 19:30.628
If the fire hits us,
which it's not going to,

19:31.212 --> 19:33.464
now we got a generator
to run the pumps, run the sprinklers.

19:33.547 --> 19:34.507
All right, what're you gonna tell Dad?

19:34.590 --> 19:37.218
I don't know.
Tell him the same shit you did.

19:37.301 --> 19:40.346
"Well, I can't tell you, Daddy.
I'm like a mysterious hero.

19:41.639 --> 19:43.766
I like to wear boots with insoles in 'em.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.518
But when we're both wearing socks,

19:45.601 --> 19:47.770
I'm not much taller
than my handsome brother Rooster."

19:49.730 --> 19:50.898
You'll have to tell Dad something.

19:51.482 --> 19:54.402
It's not your problem, dude.
Now help me unload this thing.

19:59.657 --> 20:00.491
Come on.

20:00.574 --> 20:01.909
Come on, can you lift your side
a little higher?

20:01.992 --> 20:04.120
Oh, shit what am I saying?
You're like a foot shorter than me.

20:12.378 --> 20:16.340
If you see my signed John Wayne photo
there, put it in the box.

20:17.258 --> 20:20.052
If that means there's no room
for some of the boys' artwork,

20:20.136 --> 20:21.429
let it burn.

20:22.430 --> 20:24.640
Almost all the pictures are just Colt.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.851
Once he figured out
how to use the auto-timer,

20:26.934 --> 20:28.436
that's all he did for two years.

20:30.271 --> 20:32.982
And then,
when he discovered the hair dryer,

20:33.065 --> 20:35.317
that's all he did for two years.

20:37.820 --> 20:39.655
Did he frost his tips?

20:41.866 --> 20:43.200
I don't know what that means.

20:44.410 --> 20:45.786
Put it in the box.

20:45.870 --> 20:48.205
What do you think, Beau?
The fire gonna miss us?

20:48.289 --> 20:52.126
I sure hope so.
I don't wanna live '96 all over again.

20:52.209 --> 20:53.586
Did you get hit?

20:53.669 --> 20:55.755
Yeah, we lost a lot of good grass,

20:56.338 --> 20:57.757
but no cattle.

20:57.840 --> 21:01.302
Would've been a lot worse
if not for those firefighters.

21:01.385 --> 21:03.262
Poor Duner Clark's whole place went up.

21:04.221 --> 21:08.517
He finally gave up
and went to New Orleans...

21:09.185 --> 21:11.187
just in time for Katrina.

21:12.313 --> 21:15.608
He ended up dyin' in a tornado in Tulsa.

21:15.691 --> 21:18.486
The man was like a bug lamp
for natural disasters.

21:20.863 --> 21:24.658
Well, we got lucky and it missed us.
We lost our garage in '15.

21:25.409 --> 21:27.286
There was no fire in '15.

21:27.369 --> 21:30.790
After my daughter bought all that Sudafed,
she blew up her meth lab.

21:32.541 --> 21:35.252
Well, things can be replaced,
but people can't.

21:35.336 --> 21:37.963
- Yeah.
- So... here you go.

21:38.047 --> 21:40.758
- What's this?
- Those are your pills.

21:40.841 --> 21:43.385
We can do this whole thing where
you get angry, or you can just take 'em.

21:44.136 --> 21:47.389
I expect my boys
to do shit behind my back, not you.

21:47.473 --> 21:48.766
Angry it is.

21:49.934 --> 21:51.560
Look, I'm not hiding this, Beau.

21:51.644 --> 21:54.438
If I were, I'd crush these up.
I'd put 'em in your coffee,

21:54.522 --> 21:57.191
the same way I do
with my daughter's birth control pills.

21:59.026 --> 22:01.612
That hot mess does not need another kid.

22:02.905 --> 22:05.074
I told you I didn't wanna waste
my money on that stuff.

22:05.658 --> 22:06.700
Well, you didn't. I did.

22:07.910 --> 22:08.828
Back when it was time for your surgery,

22:08.911 --> 22:12.206
I told you I wasn't sticking around
unless you took care of yourself.

22:12.289 --> 22:15.084
And you promised that you would,
so I stuck around.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.169
You've gotta hold up your end
of the bargain, Beau.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.880
I love you, Beau.

22:19.964 --> 22:21.131
Why?

22:23.843 --> 22:28.264
It's the tender way you respond
to a woman opening her heart to you.

22:29.640 --> 22:31.058
Yeah, I'm sorry.

22:32.476 --> 22:33.310
I just...

22:36.272 --> 22:37.481
I love you too, Joanne.

22:42.319 --> 22:43.320
So does that mean...

22:43.404 --> 22:46.323
Crush 'em up and put 'em in my coffee.

22:50.411 --> 22:51.620
Rooster!

22:52.204 --> 22:54.039
God, where the hell is he?

22:54.123 --> 22:55.583
Hold on.

22:56.500 --> 22:58.752
Oh, no! My boob popped out!

23:01.130 --> 23:02.673
Well, he's definitely not here.

23:04.091 --> 23:06.176
Do they ever actually pop out?

23:07.678 --> 23:09.138
No, they don't.

23:09.221 --> 23:11.765
They're not you
in boxer shorts.

23:13.767 --> 23:16.729
- All right, we'll give him five minutes.
- Yeah.

23:18.355 --> 23:21.900
So... what's in your backpack?

23:23.819 --> 23:25.487
Some documents for the courthouse.

23:26.530 --> 23:30.618
What, you mean the one piece of paper
that we fill out when we get there?

23:31.452 --> 23:34.079
Okay, there's also a bag of rice in there.

23:35.414 --> 23:38.500
I was gonna throw it at you.

23:38.584 --> 23:40.586
I mean, not the whole thing at once.

23:40.669 --> 23:43.589
Oh, you don't throw rice anymore.
You throw birdseed,

23:43.672 --> 23:47.384
'cause rice expands.
It makes the birds explode.

23:47.468 --> 23:49.511
Wait.

23:50.512 --> 23:52.348
Seriously?

23:52.931 --> 23:54.850
Colt, it's not a good thing.

23:55.851 --> 23:57.645
Come on. What is in the bag?

23:59.355 --> 24:00.939
Well, it might be a little present
in there for you.

24:01.023 --> 24:03.567
Ooh-hoo! That's so sweet!

24:04.568 --> 24:05.444
- Okay.
- Okay.

24:05.527 --> 24:08.238
All right, I know for a wedding
you're supposed to get something old,

24:08.322 --> 24:10.240
something new, something borrowed
and something blue.

24:10.824 --> 24:14.244
But I mean it is really hard
to find all those things at once.

24:14.328 --> 24:17.581
Well, that's 'cause they're supposed
to be four different things. So...

24:18.916 --> 24:19.958
Oh.

24:21.502 --> 24:25.005
That's part of the surprise,
'cause it's all of those things at once.

24:25.089 --> 24:27.549
- So, surprise!
- Oh.

24:27.633 --> 24:28.801
Okay.

24:28.884 --> 24:33.263
Oh, those are actually real tissues
in case you tear up at the courthouse.

24:33.847 --> 24:35.474
In case I tear up?

24:35.557 --> 24:36.642
Well, the point is they're tissues.

24:36.725 --> 24:37.601
- Just open it!
- Okay.

24:40.562 --> 24:44.525
- Oh, my God! It's a John Elway jersey!
- Yeah.

24:44.608 --> 24:47.861
- But it's game worn, so it's old.
- Oh.

24:47.945 --> 24:49.113
But it's new to you.

24:49.196 --> 24:52.199
And it's blue, and I bought it with money

24:52.282 --> 24:53.867
I borrowed, so...

24:54.493 --> 24:57.413
- Oh, thank you, Colt. This is amazing.
- Okay.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.039
Now, if you don't like it,

24:59.123 --> 25:01.583
I know someone who'll take it
off your hands and treasure it.

25:03.877 --> 25:06.588
You're regretting giving it to me already,
aren't you?

25:07.172 --> 25:08.632
This might be my biggest sacrifice.

25:10.759 --> 25:11.927
I'm glad you like it.

25:15.139 --> 25:16.932
I got you something too.

25:17.433 --> 25:19.727
Well, you better have.

25:22.396 --> 25:24.565
Uh...

25:26.066 --> 25:27.276
That was my...

25:27.860 --> 25:29.820
grandfather's favorite bolo tie.

25:34.450 --> 25:35.492
I love it.

25:35.576 --> 25:38.495
Yeah, he gave it to me
right before he died,

25:39.246 --> 25:42.082
And said that he hoped
that I would meet a man

25:42.166 --> 25:43.792
worthy enough to wear it.

25:44.585 --> 25:46.211
And since I never did,
I'm giving it to you.

25:49.757 --> 25:50.841
Oh,

25:50.924 --> 25:53.010
I can't imagine my life without you.

25:53.594 --> 25:55.888
And I'm so glad that I don't have to.

25:56.805 --> 26:00.976
I guess what I'm saying is, is that
you can inspect my bikini any time.

26:02.603 --> 26:03.979
I love you so much.

26:05.856 --> 26:07.900
I knew these would come in handy.

26:08.984 --> 26:11.195
- Hey. Wind shifted.
- What?

26:11.278 --> 26:12.946
Fire's coming right at us.
We gotta get out of here.

26:13.530 --> 26:14.823
- Let's go.
- Really?

26:23.832 --> 26:25.834
All right, get those Rain Birds all set.

26:25.918 --> 26:28.253
- I got some of your old artwork.
- Oh.

26:28.337 --> 26:30.547
Good. My dad's sentimental
about that stuff.

26:30.631 --> 26:33.133
- Oh, uh, I grabbed my Xbox.
- Good.

26:33.717 --> 26:36.553
- How much more is there?
- That's pretty much the last of it.

26:36.637 --> 26:37.721
We just gotta get the guns.

26:37.805 --> 26:41.433
You see that fire?
It is time to get the fuck out of here.

26:42.017 --> 26:43.936
- Okay.
- Fire everywhere.

26:44.019 --> 26:45.854
Ash falling from the sky.

26:46.438 --> 26:51.026
It's like <i>Backdraft.</i>
Remember that movie? It still holds up.

26:53.153 --> 26:53.987
Go!

26:54.780 --> 26:55.864
I gotta go help my parents.

26:56.448 --> 26:57.866
Are you sure you don't want me
to come with you?

26:57.950 --> 26:59.952
No, I'm fine.
Their place is away from the fire.

27:00.035 --> 27:01.703
You finish up here.
I'll meet you at the high school.

27:01.787 --> 27:04.081
Text me
as soon as the Elway jersey's safe.

27:04.164 --> 27:05.582
And me?

27:06.583 --> 27:08.961
Yeah, of course, you.
That goes without saying.

27:09.044 --> 27:11.338
Well, it shouldn't. Love you.

27:12.172 --> 27:13.173
See you.

27:14.049 --> 27:16.134
- Be careful, Abby.
- You, too.

27:16.718 --> 27:20.806
Hey, Dad, did you by chance
pack up any of my hair products?

27:21.390 --> 27:24.643
Of course I did.
It's the first fucking thing I grabbed.

27:29.231 --> 27:31.191
- Hey, I grabbed the basement guns.
- Oh.

27:31.275 --> 27:32.442
Did you get the bathroom gun?

27:33.026 --> 27:34.778
Dude, we moved it, remember?
Now it's the kitchen gun.

27:34.862 --> 27:35.863
Oh, right.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.787
Hey, don't forget the bullets.

27:43.871 --> 27:46.331
Shit. That's good thinking.

27:46.415 --> 27:47.374
All right.

27:49.209 --> 27:50.919
- Okay.
- All right, let's roll.

27:54.798 --> 27:56.216
Hey. Hey, Dad.

27:57.301 --> 28:01.346
We look kinda badass right now. Would you
mind taking a picture real quick?

28:02.973 --> 28:04.600
Get in the goddamn truck.

28:06.518 --> 28:09.187
Where's Drake? Drake!

28:11.773 --> 28:14.151
Hey, get up there. Attaboy.

28:20.282 --> 28:21.116
Whoa.

28:21.199 --> 28:23.035
Dad, where you going?

28:23.619 --> 28:27.205
- I wanna make sure the gas is turned off.
- I double-checked. It's off.

28:27.789 --> 28:29.458
Maybe we forgot something else.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.043
Dad, we gotta go.

28:31.126 --> 28:33.128
I'll meet you at the school.
