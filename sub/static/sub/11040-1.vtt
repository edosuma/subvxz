If I get one call about you, you are fired!
Better you than me.

10:11.711 --> 10:13.235
You know, I think that's fair, Mommy.

10:23.689 --> 10:24.713

- No.

10:24.790 --> 10:28.988
Eric comes in here on time to do his work,

10:29.061 --> 10:34.124
You're absolutely right, Mom.
And you know what? It's getting late,

It kept cutting me off.
It wouldn't let me say all the numbers.

34:07.078 --> 34:10.275
<i>- WOMAN: Tracking number, one character...</i>
- lf you shut up, I could finish.

Yes, JesÃºs, I got something to eat.
So what? I was hungry.

34:37.809 --> 34:39.639
You shouldn't have spit on my food.

That's why he had the buggy-eyed look
on his face.

43:22.499 --> 43:23.966
You know, it's funny,

43:24.034 --> 43:25.592
just talking to your friend here
for a little while,

43:25.669 --> 43:26.658
(GROANS)

43:26.737 --> 43:29.433
It seems like I've known you all my life.

43:29.506 --> 43:32.839
I know about your mother.
I even know about your father.

43:32.910 --> 43:35.310
- Fuck. How?
- BODEGA: God bless his soul.

43:35.379 --> 43:36.778
Now I...

43:37.781 --> 43:42.115
No. You need to be straight up with me
right about now.

43:42.620 --> 43:45.180
A couple of days ago,
I sent your friend here a package.

43:45.255 --> 43:48.315
After a long talk,
he told me that he never got it.

43:48.392 --> 43:50.292
- He says you have it.
- Me?

43:50.361 --> 43:51.350
Shut the fuck up!

43:51.428 --> 43:53.259
(MUFFLED MOANING)

43:53.330 --> 43:54.854
Shut the fuck up!

43:56.433 --> 43:57.798
Now where's my shit?

43:59.637 --> 44:01.332
I almost shit on myself.

44:01.939 --> 44:05.238
The last thing I wanted to do is to
tell this man that I don't have his shit.

44:05.309 --> 44:07.641
Right, right. So what did you say?

44:07.711 --> 44:11.203
I didn't bite my tongue like no bitch.
I told him the truth.

44:12.750 --> 44:14.581
Look, this motherfucker right here...

44:14.652 --> 44:16.950
<i>JESUS: I look him</i>
<i>dead in the eyes and I said,</i>

44:17.021 --> 44:19.581
<i>"Look, I don't know what Hector told you,</i>
<i>but I don't think my friend</i>

44:19.657 --> 44:21.488
<i>"had anything to do</i>
<i>with your shit being stolen.</i>

44:21.558 --> 44:23.185
<i>"I've known this guy my whole life.</i>

44:23.260 --> 44:26.195
<i>"One thing I can bet my life on</i>
<i>is that he ain't no thief.</i>

44:26.263 --> 44:29.426
<i>"Now whatever it takes,</i>
<i>we'll get your money back.</i>

44:29.500 --> 44:30.990
<i>"Just let my friend go."</i>

44:31.068 --> 44:32.467
Damn, baby, you said that shit?

44:32.536 --> 44:35.403
You fucking right I said that shit,
and then check this out.

44:35.472 --> 44:36.837
<i>JESUS: He had the nerve to say...</i>

44:36.907 --> 44:38.238
Shut up!

44:39.843 --> 44:43.677
Your boss, he's fired, okay?
You now work for me.

44:43.747 --> 44:46.307
<i>JESUS: I'm standing there thinking,</i>
<i>"I gotta be out of my goddamn mind...</i>

44:46.383 --> 44:47.782
It's cool with me man.
Whatever you say.

44:47.851 --> 44:51.446
"...if you think I'm gonna work for a piece
of shit Mexican ass motherfucker like you."

44:51.522 --> 44:53.114
- Hell, no.
- For what?

44:53.190 --> 44:56.421
So I can end up like this?
You're fucking crazy.

44:56.493 --> 44:58.552
So I looked him dead in the eyes,

44:58.629 --> 45:01.223
and I said what any real motherfucker
would have said.

45:01.298 --> 45:02.765
What did you say?

45:05.502 --> 45:06.901
(GUN FIRES)

45:08.505 --> 45:09.665
Yes, sir.

45:10.674 --> 45:14.872
Shit, I ain't stupid, now.
A Cali connect, exactly what I needed.

45:14.945 --> 45:16.139
And that's what I'm talking about.

45:16.213 --> 45:18.306
Yo, baby! Yo, that's him right there!

45:18.615 --> 45:20.082
- Ain't that him?
- Shit!

45:20.150 --> 45:21.412
(HUMMING)

45:29.126 --> 45:32.391
JESUS: Oh, shit! That's gotta be him.
That's gotta be him, yo.

45:32.463 --> 45:35.330
- Give me the shotgun. This motherfucker...
- Here.

45:35.399 --> 45:38.960
Stay your ass in the car! You hear me?
Stay in the car!

45:39.870 --> 45:41.098
Stay in the car!

45:45.008 --> 45:46.771
Where's my shit, motherfucker?

45:46.844 --> 45:48.505
Sir, do you have an account with NDA?

45:48.579 --> 45:50.706
Don't be playing with me.
You know what the fuck I'm talking about.

45:50.781 --> 45:52.214
Fuck that shit.

45:53.383 --> 45:56.910
ERIC: Okay. Okay. All right. All right.
Listen. Listen. Just hold tight.

45:56.987 --> 45:59.922
Just don't report me. You can take that.

45:59.990 --> 46:01.582
You done sold that shit already?

46:01.658 --> 46:03.148
I don't know what you're talking about.
I didn't...

46:03.227 --> 46:04.251
CHITA: Oh!

46:04.328 --> 46:05.761
- No, you don't know what the...
- No.

46:05.829 --> 46:07.592
You know what the fuck I'm talking about!

46:07.664 --> 46:08.688
Huh?

46:08.766 --> 46:11.030
- Don't lie to me!
- Chi.

46:11.535 --> 46:13.765
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You don't know?

46:13.837 --> 46:15.099
- No.
- CHITA: No? Okay.

46:15.172 --> 46:18.141
Listen, we don't keep cash in the truck.

46:18.208 --> 46:20.802
You can just take this because it's all I got.

46:20.878 --> 46:22.778
What the fuck is this? Huh?

46:23.747 --> 46:25.112
Fake gold.

46:26.483 --> 46:29.680
- I don't wear fake gold.
- I wasn't trying to insult you.

46:30.154 --> 46:32.748
- Turn around! Now!
- Okay. Okay. I'm turning around.

46:32.823 --> 46:35.519
CHITA: All the way.
JESUS: Chi?

46:35.592 --> 46:37.253
- CHITA: What?
- What the hell are you doing here?

46:37.327 --> 46:39.352
You were taking too fucking long.

46:41.031 --> 46:42.965
- Turn around.
- You said all the way.

46:43.033 --> 46:44.898
- JESUS: What the fuck is wrong with you?
- I'm sorry, okay.

46:44.968 --> 46:45.957
Chi.

46:46.103 --> 46:49.129
- What? What?
- I don't even think that's him.

46:50.641 --> 46:52.165
What do you mean that's not him?

46:52.242 --> 46:53.641
- JESUS: That's not him.
- It's not me.

46:53.710 --> 46:54.734
(CHITA SHOUTS IN SPANISH)

46:55.145 --> 46:57.409
Chi, just relax.

46:58.582 --> 46:59.606
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

46:59.683 --> 47:01.674
- It's cool.
- CHITA: Now what? What now?

47:01.752 --> 47:03.549
JESUS: Let's get the hell out of here.

47:05.022 --> 47:06.216
What about this?

47:06.290 --> 47:08.258
Take that shit. I'll rock it.

47:08.325 --> 47:09.792
(STAMMERING) Can I say one thing?

47:09.860 --> 47:12.693
- BOTH: What?
- No disrespect. No disrespect.

47:13.564 --> 47:16.931
I like your outfit. You look very nice.
I like your shoes. I like your top.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.490
- The pants.
- Thank you.

47:18.569 --> 47:21.037
Get your ass out of the truck. Now!

47:21.939 --> 47:23.429
Turn the fuck around.

47:24.241 --> 47:26.539
What the fuck is wrong with you?
"Nice outfit."

47:40.524 --> 47:41.752
Damn that bitch is bad.

47:42.326 --> 47:44.191
BRODY: Hello? Shavoo?

47:45.295 --> 47:47.991
Oh, man, damn. Don't say that, man.

47:48.065 --> 47:51.000
- What, what?
- Shut the fuck up and chill.

47:52.703 --> 47:56.730
All right, man, I guess. All right. Go on.

47:57.140 --> 47:59.904
- (SCOFFS) Damn.

47:59.977 --> 48:01.706
That was Shavoo, man.
Something came up.

48:01.778 --> 48:03.746
He said he ain't nothing gonna pop off
till the morning.

48:03.814 --> 48:05.645
Oh! Ain't that a bitch?
See, that's what I'm talking about.

48:05.716 --> 48:09.174
- What happened to that two hour shit?
- I don't know. Shit.

48:09.253 --> 48:11.346
That's what I fucking mean, man.

48:11.421 --> 48:14.254
I'm glad I didn't let the motherfuckers
take the package out of here.

48:14.324 --> 48:16.189
Just be cool, man.
Everything will work out.

48:16.260 --> 48:18.990
Ain't no "be cool" shit, man.
A lot could happen by tomorrow morning.

48:19.062 --> 48:20.188
This motherfucker right here
might wake up.

48:20.264 --> 48:22.596
BRODY: Please, he ain't waking up.

48:22.666 --> 48:24.827
I think that motherfucker's
trying to set us up, man.

48:24.902 --> 48:28.998
He's not gonna set us up, man.
It's my cousin. I keep telling you, man.

48:29.072 --> 48:32.735
Now, look, if he said by tomorrow,
tomorrow it'll be. I know.

48:32.809 --> 48:35.744
Okay, cool! What if he say two hours?
What do that mean?

48:35.812 --> 48:39.873
That mean we celebrate, baby.
You know what I'm saying?

48:39.950 --> 48:42.817
You know the little freak chick, Kira, right?

48:42.886 --> 48:46.049
I'm gonna call her and a couple of her little
friends over, you know what I'm saying?

48:46.123 --> 48:48.250
Have them come over tonight,
tighten us up.

48:48.325 --> 48:50.225
By tomorrow, we be ready, baby.

48:50.294 --> 48:54.162
We'll be busting four and five nuts,
we'll be ready to get that money, honey.

48:54.298 --> 48:56.425
BRODY: I'm gonna call her right here.
GUCH: You know which one I like,

48:56.500 --> 48:59.060
that young Chinatown...

48:59.136 --> 49:01.297
(SINGING) <i>We gonna bend her, spin her</i>
<i>and go up in her!</i>

49:01.371 --> 49:04.602
Tell her there ain't no bullshit, man.
Tell her no bullshit going on.

49:05.208 --> 49:07.039
Hey, what's up? What y'all doing?

49:08.045 --> 49:10.809
Hey, why don't you
get a couple of your little girls

49:10.881 --> 49:13.349
and why don't y'all swing through here

49:13.417 --> 49:16.215
and do something strange
for a little piece of change?

49:18.789 --> 49:19.778
DERRICK: Look...

49:19.856 --> 49:21.118
(CRYING)

49:21.959 --> 49:24.393
Look, I don't know
what you're talking about...

49:24.461 --> 49:27.294
- Yo, Shav. What you got there?
- Please...

49:27.364 --> 49:29.889
Got some acetone.
"Extremely flammable liquid..."

49:29.967 --> 49:34.131
Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay! I'll tell you!
I'll tell you! I'll tell you!

49:34.204 --> 49:36.297
It wasn't me. It wasn't me.
But I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

49:36.373 --> 49:37.670
Who took my shit?

49:37.741 --> 49:39.368
(ALL CHATTERING)

49:40.043 --> 49:41.874
You took my shit, didn't you?

49:41.945 --> 49:44.778
It wasn't me. It wasn't me,
but I'll tell you who it is. I'll tell you.

49:44.848 --> 49:47.373
Please. Please. Okay. Okay.

49:49.886 --> 49:51.911
So, what you doing tonight, baby?

49:52.556 --> 49:53.648
Huh?

49:54.257 --> 49:58.717
What would you say
if we took a helicopter ride to AC

49:58.795 --> 50:00.285
and gambled a little bit?

50:01.164 --> 50:02.426
(LAUGHS)

50:04.067 --> 50:07.559
No, you're funny girl.
No, all this here is just a front, baby.

50:07.637 --> 50:09.969
I'm balling, baby. I'm balling.

50:11.008 --> 50:13.374
Yo, dang, man, let me call you back.

50:15.245 --> 50:16.769
Hey, brother, how can I help you?

50:16.847 --> 50:18.109
What up, man?

50:18.715 --> 50:19.977
Wade, right?

50:21.585 --> 50:23.849
- Yeah, Wade.
- Cool.

50:24.521 --> 50:26.546
- Let me get some rope.
- Rope.

50:26.623 --> 50:29.148
(CLICKS TONGUE) And some tape.

50:29.226 --> 50:32.093
And some tape. Here you go, bro.

50:33.463 --> 50:35.192
Duct tape would be better.

50:35.265 --> 50:37.995
- Duct tape. Okay. Got that.
- Yup. I need duct tape.

50:38.535 --> 50:42.130
Here you go, brother. Duct tape.
I'll take that for you.

50:42.205 --> 50:45.538
And a padlock.
How could I forget a padlock?

50:45.609 --> 50:47.543
Padlock. Here it is.

50:48.211 --> 50:50.042
- Cool.
- That's what's up.

50:50.447 --> 50:51.641
It's a good one?

50:51.715 --> 50:54.741
Yeah, that's a good one, man.
Everybody get that one.

50:54.818 --> 50:56.376
Okay. Cool.

50:56.453 --> 51:00.082
- I got my rope, padlock, tape.
- Is that it, brother?

51:02.159 --> 51:05.993
- (LAUGHS) And I'm gonna need my money.
- What the fuck is you talking about?

51:06.063 --> 51:09.794
Man, we don't even do that up in here, man.
I don't know what you're talking...

51:09.866 --> 51:12.767
Before you start all that lying and shit,

51:13.603 --> 51:17.266
let me paint a picture for you,
where my head is at right now.

51:19.910 --> 51:21.309
(COCKS GUN)

51:21.912 --> 51:23.345
I need you to feel me.

51:25.315 --> 51:28.682
You talking to a brother
that just lost everything,

51:28.752 --> 51:32.779
and picture
he knows for a fact that you took it.

51:33.723 --> 51:34.747
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

51:34.825 --> 51:39.353
So, actually, I want you to... No, fuck that.
I can't wait for you to lie about it.

51:42.632 --> 51:43.894
You feel me?

51:54.044 --> 51:55.739
Yo, Voo, you good?

51:56.746 --> 51:58.976
<i>SHAVOO ON PHONE: Yep. We good.</i>

Motherfucker, what you relaxing for?
This shit ain't over.

52:09.226 --> 52:10.318
Oh! Motherfucker...

52:10.393 --> 52:11.382
(THUDDING)

52:11.795 --> 52:13.228
You know what that one told me?

52:13.296 --> 52:16.163
He told me this padlock
was the best padlock in the joint.

52:16.233 --> 52:17.928
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you told me that, remember?

52:18.001 --> 52:18.990
(MUFFLED MUMBLING)

52:19.069 --> 52:21.037
He knows his shit. You can't cut them.

52:21.505 --> 52:23.234
- No?
- No.

CASS: (LAUGHS) That's crazy.
You see this bitch?

52:51.801 --> 52:54.235
Sparrow. What's good, buddy?

52:54.304 --> 52:55.328
(LAUGHS)

52:55.405 --> 52:57.134
What's up? What's up?

52:57.207 --> 52:59.368
- What's up? What's up, Leo?
- What's up, Cass?

52:59.442 --> 53:01.171
- All right.
- Good to see you.

53:01.244 --> 53:04.111
- Where the weed at?
- Got it right here. What you looking for?

53:04.181 --> 53:06.615
What you got? You got dimes? Dubs?
What's up?

53:06.683 --> 53:09.379
I'm all out of dimes. Only got...

53:09.452 --> 53:10.646
But you don't want that, though, man.

53:10.720 --> 53:11.709
No.

53:11.788 --> 53:12.777
(BOTH LAUGH)

53:12.856 --> 53:14.050
I only got dubs left. What you looking for?

53:14.124 --> 53:15.421
Let me get two dubs. That's what's up.

53:15.492 --> 53:16.754
CASS: Two of them?
LEO: Yeah.

53:16.826 --> 53:17.815
I've got you.

53:18.461 --> 53:21.089
- Here you go, homey. Appreciate it.
- No doubt.

53:21.164 --> 53:22.495
CASS: Everything good?

53:23.099 --> 53:25.090
It's gravy, but...

53:25.168 --> 53:27.534
I know they a little small
because they was in my pocket.

53:27.604 --> 53:30.095
They smashed down,
but it ain't the size of the boat,

53:30.173 --> 53:33.233
it's the motion in the ocean.
That shit be flowing. Trust me.

53:33.310 --> 53:36.336
