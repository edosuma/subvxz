22:06.250 --> 22:08.500
beyond the money
and the trappings.

22:08.500 --> 22:12.333
The idea that he's serving
something greater than

22:12.333 --> 22:14.875
himself is what drives
him. But he...has an

22:14.875 --> 22:17.625
old fashioned sense of
honor, chivalry almost--

22:17.625 --> 22:19.417
not in any paternalistic
sense of the word.

22:19.417 --> 22:21.667

frat for a hazing incident

22:21.667 --> 22:23.166
even though he
wasn't part of it.

22:23.166 --> 22:25.000

line if he couldn't see

22:25.000 --> 22:27.500
the harm in it, especially if
it benefited the organization

22:27.500 --> 22:29.834
as a whole, but he'd never
do something truly against

22:29.834 --> 22:31.166
his sense of wrong
and right.

22:31.166 --> 22:33.041
Something that
would cause him dishonor.

22:33.041 --> 22:34.834
I see.

22:34.834 --> 22:37.959
Do you think he'd consider lying
dishonorable by its nature?

22:37.959 --> 22:39.750
It would depend
on the situation.

22:39.750 --> 22:41.333

protect a friend.
