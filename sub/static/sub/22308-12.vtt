A big part of the reason
for being here

01:50.476 --> 01:52.543

02:46.432 --> 02:50.267
Welcome to the historic
Bob Baker Marionette Theater.

02:50.303 --> 02:53.571
Bob Baker was a legendary
puppeteer and marionette maker

03:37.417 --> 03:40.151
there's something else you need

04:27.934 --> 04:29.700
that you tap into
the colors, materials,

04:29.735 --> 04:33.037
and cultural history
of your dolls for inspiration.

04:45.084 --> 04:46.050
I'm actually pretty excited.

04:46.052 --> 04:47.034
This is pretty fun.

04:47.069 --> 04:48.352
I picked the baby doll,

04:48.387 --> 04:50.187
and I decide that my character

04:50.223 --> 04:52.523
is used for religious practice.

04:52.575 --> 04:54.525
When a human touches
the baby doll,

04:54.527 --> 04:57.061
that human's life-force
is sucked into the doll.

04:57.096 --> 05:00.264
I come up with this doll face
that's cracked open,

05:00.299 --> 05:03.534
with a tentacle monster
on the inside of it.

05:06.772 --> 05:08.772
I actually had a porcelain doll

05:08.774 --> 05:10.641
when I was a little girl,

05:10.643 --> 05:13.761
so this is bringing back
a lot of memories.

05:13.813 --> 05:16.981
I think a good way
to make this doll really creepy

05:17.016 --> 05:19.817
is to make it appear broken.

05:19.852 --> 05:21.919
I'm going to keep the classic

05:21.954 --> 05:23.954
porcelain doll
shape of the face,

05:23.990 --> 05:26.774
but then add a lot
of cracking texture.

05:26.809 --> 05:28.959
I'm pretty excited
about this concept.

05:32.865 --> 05:34.198
(Logan)
I picked the voodoo doll

05:34.200 --> 05:35.533
because there
are certain elements

05:35.568 --> 05:36.767
about the voodoo doll itself...

05:36.802 --> 05:38.402
the stitching, the burlap...

05:38.437 --> 05:40.671
that are very unique
as opposed to the other dolls.

05:40.706 --> 05:42.406
I decide that my character
is a child

05:42.408 --> 05:45.809
who was tortured with
a voodoo doll relentlessly,

05:45.845 --> 05:48.846
to the point where it started
to transform him physically.

05:48.881 --> 05:51.198
So I'm turning a man
into a doll.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.886
I am so excited.

05:55.938 --> 05:58.188
I picked the ragdoll.

05:58.190 --> 06:00.024
I decide that the family dog

06:00.059 --> 06:02.993
took this ragdoll
out in the rain, ripped it up,

06:03.029 --> 06:05.195
then the little girl brought it
back into the house.

06:05.231 --> 06:07.498
And it's soaking wet,
and it starts to mold,

06:07.533 --> 06:09.266
and it's slowly
killing the family

06:09.302 --> 06:11.268
by releasing mold spores.

06:11.304 --> 06:13.938
Oh, God, it's so creepy.

06:13.973 --> 06:15.539
I picked the ventriloquist dummy

06:15.575 --> 06:17.775
just 'cause I've always been
kind of creeped out by it

06:17.810 --> 06:19.026
since I was little.

06:19.061 --> 06:23.130
My concept is that he was carved
out of a sacred tree

06:23.165 --> 06:25.115
by a witch to be her minion.

06:25.151 --> 06:28.252
So I want to incorporate
wood texture into the sculpt,

06:28.287 --> 06:30.888
try to figure out how to get
a rigid jaw piece

06:30.923 --> 06:33.157
to get that flapping motion.

06:33.159 --> 06:35.292
All right, guys,
let's head back to the lab.

06:41.817 --> 06:43.300
(Emily) We have five
hours in the lab today,

06:43.336 --> 06:45.502
and my priority is not even
to think about the face.

06:45.538 --> 06:48.088
It's just to get the chest done.

06:48.140 --> 06:50.758
There's no exceptions.

06:50.793 --> 06:54.545
Since I'm creating
a ripped-fabric look,

06:54.580 --> 06:55.846
I need to find something

06:55.881 --> 06:58.315
that will give it
that fabric texture.

06:58.351 --> 07:01.302
And I see crepe wool,
which is used for hair work.

07:01.354 --> 07:02.436
That'd be neat.

07:02.471 --> 07:04.655
It's exactly
what I want to sculpt,

07:04.707 --> 07:07.157
so I'm not gonna sculpt it;
I'm gonna mold it.

07:07.209 --> 07:08.659
What are you trying to do?

07:08.711 --> 07:10.594
I'm making a mold
of this texture,

07:10.646 --> 07:12.930
so then I can put the clay in it
to get the fabric.

07:12.932 --> 07:14.131
Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.

07:14.166 --> 07:15.332
Once I have my mold,

07:15.368 --> 07:17.551
I roll out the clay
into little logs,

07:17.603 --> 07:19.269
and I press it into the mold,

07:19.305 --> 07:22.106
and then I just pull them apart
and place it all over the chest.

07:29.532 --> 07:30.748
All right.

07:30.783 --> 07:31.732
Hey, Laura.

07:31.784 --> 07:32.950
(Laura)
Hey, how you guys doing?

07:32.985 --> 07:34.151
I'm great.

07:34.153 --> 07:35.152
Oh, gosh, where are the dolls?

07:35.204 --> 07:36.320
They're over
in the corner there.

07:36.322 --> 07:37.738
Oh, my God, they're creepy.

07:37.790 --> 07:38.772
(Darla)
Yeah.

07:38.808 --> 07:39.773
You excited
about this challenge?

07:39.809 --> 07:40.758
Yeah.

07:40.810 --> 07:41.976
I got the baby doll,

07:42.011 --> 07:43.344
so I came up with a story

07:43.379 --> 07:47.264
where a baby is a portal
for demons to come through.

07:47.266 --> 07:48.666
I think if you
can pull this off,

07:48.701 --> 07:49.767
it'd be great.

07:49.769 --> 07:51.435
But if everyone is just
doing faces and cowls,

07:51.487 --> 07:53.437
they're gonna be able
to put more time into that.

07:53.489 --> 07:54.605
Right.

07:54.657 --> 07:57.324
Which could make their faces
and cowls look better,

07:57.360 --> 07:58.325
if you're not careful.

07:58.361 --> 07:59.343
I understand.

07:59.345 --> 08:00.678
I don't want Logan and Adam

08:00.680 --> 08:03.447
to lose that risk factor.

08:03.482 --> 08:05.249
I don't want them
to play it so safe

08:05.251 --> 08:07.134
that it bores everyone.

08:07.169 --> 08:09.653
But it's getting that time
in the competition

08:09.655 --> 08:11.822
where you can't have
one slip-up.

08:11.824 --> 08:14.491
I only have two artists
left on my team.

08:14.543 --> 08:16.226
I don't want to lose
anyone else.

08:18.848 --> 08:20.814
I'm gonna do
a broken porcelain doll.

08:20.850 --> 08:21.999
(Laura)
Oh, it's so creepy.

08:22.034 --> 08:23.500
(Darla)
Once it's glued back together,

08:23.536 --> 08:25.536
the little girl doesn't want
to play with it anymore,

08:25.571 --> 08:29.156
so then the cracks are now
where the evil comes from.

08:29.191 --> 08:30.858
You could actually
exaggerate the head,

08:30.893 --> 08:31.859
I think, a little bit.

08:31.894 --> 08:32.860
A little bit further?

08:32.895 --> 08:33.943
- Further.
- Yeah.

08:33.979 --> 08:35.162
If I sculpt the head

08:35.214 --> 08:37.381
just a little bit too big
for the body,

08:37.416 --> 08:40.616
that'll really help kind of
sell the creepy factor.

08:40.653 --> 08:42.352
And that's exactly what I want.

08:44.990 --> 08:46.824
(Emily)
After I finish the chest piece,

08:46.859 --> 08:48.625
I run it to the mold room
and start molding

08:48.661 --> 08:50.561
as fast as I can.

08:50.596 --> 08:51.712
I need to get this done

08:51.764 --> 08:53.831
so I can start
sculpting the face.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.503
Hi, everybody.

08:59.538 --> 09:00.537
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:00.573 --> 09:01.538
Hi.

09:01.574 --> 09:02.790
- Hi, Logan.
- Hey, Mr. Westmore.

09:02.825 --> 09:04.141
How are you?

09:04.143 --> 09:06.043
I'm essentially creating
a human-voodoo doll hybrid

09:06.078 --> 09:07.394
- these will be forms...
- Okay.

09:07.446 --> 09:08.879
To which I will apply the burlap

09:08.931 --> 09:10.714
where it's been
infused into the flesh.

09:10.716 --> 09:11.849
That should work very well.

09:11.901 --> 09:13.217
When you get down
to your edges here,

09:13.219 --> 09:14.818
make sure you get
all those down,

09:14.854 --> 09:17.454
as opposed to getting
a hard edge right there.

09:17.456 --> 09:18.455
All right.

09:18.491 --> 09:20.274
This baby doll
is actually a portal

09:20.326 --> 09:21.825
for demonic possession.

09:21.861 --> 09:24.695
There's something
coming through the doll

09:24.730 --> 09:26.597
from hell or another dimension.

09:26.599 --> 09:28.432
You're really going way out.

09:28.484 --> 09:29.433
Yeah.

09:29.485 --> 09:30.434
Be careful.

09:30.486 --> 09:31.652
Don't lose "baby doll,"

09:31.687 --> 09:33.904
that you all of a sudden
wind up making a monster...

09:33.939 --> 09:34.905
Right.

09:34.940 --> 09:36.073
That doesn't really relate

09:36.075 --> 09:37.641
to what the challenge is.

09:37.676 --> 09:39.543
I understand what
Mr. Westmore has to say,

09:39.595 --> 09:43.313
but I don't want to put a big,
baby-headed doll out there.

09:43.349 --> 09:45.015
I'd rather go complete 180

09:45.067 --> 09:47.918
and at least make something
different that stands out.

09:47.953 --> 09:49.887
- Well, good luck.
- Thank you very much.

09:49.922 --> 09:52.222
I selected
the ventriloquist dummy.

09:52.224 --> 09:54.224
(Michael) This is actually
gonna be wood grain here?

09:54.226 --> 09:55.192
(Julian)
Yes.

09:55.244 --> 09:56.660
Old carved wood.

09:56.695 --> 09:58.612
Okay, I like what you're
doing with the mouth here.

09:58.647 --> 10:01.498
Now, you can give this down
nice and tight,

10:01.534 --> 10:04.118
so when he does open his mouth,

10:04.153 --> 10:06.253
that will work the same way.

10:06.288 --> 10:07.688
Okay.

10:07.740 --> 10:09.706
So this is the porcelain doll.

10:09.742 --> 10:10.824
(Michael)
Porcelain doll.

10:10.876 --> 10:11.975
I'm gonna make it look as though

10:12.011 --> 10:13.977
it's broken into large pieces

10:14.013 --> 10:15.612
that have been glued
back together.

10:15.648 --> 10:18.632
You've got such a nice
base sculpture going for you.

10:18.667 --> 10:19.633
Be careful with the cracks now.

10:19.668 --> 10:20.651
Okay.

10:20.653 --> 10:22.369
Usually there's a major spot,

10:22.404 --> 10:24.788
and then from the place
they've originally cracked from,

10:24.824 --> 10:26.023
it thins.

10:26.025 --> 10:27.724
It's almost like a few
little branches off of it.

10:27.726 --> 10:28.759
Yep.

10:28.761 --> 10:30.861
Now, you have the ragdoll.

10:30.863 --> 10:32.496
What are you planning
on your facial sculpture?

10:32.531 --> 10:34.448
I'm going to make button eyes,

10:34.483 --> 10:38.101
and have one here, one that
kind of popped and falls.

10:38.103 --> 10:39.353
You know what'd be interesting

10:39.405 --> 10:41.955
is to take
some good-size thread

10:41.991 --> 10:43.674
and attach it up in here

10:43.726 --> 10:46.443
so it looks like the thread
has actually come loose.

10:46.495 --> 10:48.162
- Good luck.
- Thank you so much.

10:48.197 --> 10:49.580
Good luck, everybody.

10:49.615 --> 10:51.098
Your sculptures look wonderful.

10:51.133 --> 10:52.249
- Thanks.
- Oh, thank you.

10:52.284 --> 10:53.500
Thank you.

11:00.276 --> 11:02.359
(Emily)
My mold's not very ready.

11:02.394 --> 11:05.045
But if I don't get
this chest done today,

11:05.097 --> 11:06.530
I will be so far behind.

11:06.565 --> 11:08.198
So I need to open it now.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.499
As I pull it apart,

11:09.535 --> 11:12.469
it opens nice, but then...

11:12.471 --> 11:14.638
Holy shit!

11:14.673 --> 11:17.207
It just falls.

11:17.243 --> 11:19.843
I expect to see this mold
just in pieces

11:19.895 --> 11:20.844
when I lift it up.

11:20.896 --> 11:22.062
Oh, no.

11:22.097 --> 11:23.513
And all I'm thinking is,

11:23.515 --> 11:25.315
"That's it, I'm done."

11:31.313 --> 11:33.797
It's the first day
of our creepy doll challenge.

11:33.832 --> 11:35.749
And as I pull it apart,

11:35.784 --> 11:38.618
my chest mold just falls.

11:38.654 --> 11:40.454
Holy shit!

11:40.489 --> 11:43.573
I expect to see this mold
just in pieces.

11:43.609 --> 11:46.326
But I pull it up,
and the mold is thick enough

11:46.361 --> 11:48.695
where it was able
to take the blow.

11:48.747 --> 11:50.280
Wow.

11:50.282 --> 11:52.582
How did that not break?

11:52.618 --> 11:54.568
It has a slight crack in it.

11:54.620 --> 11:55.952
But then I realize

11:55.988 --> 11:58.255
it's supposed to have
that distressed look anyway,

11:58.290 --> 11:59.456
so it's okay.

12:09.918 --> 12:11.334
So what are these gonna be?

12:11.370 --> 12:12.736
(Logan)
Burlap.

12:12.771 --> 12:14.838
I think it'd be much easier
to lay the burlap over the top,

12:14.873 --> 12:16.840
instead of sculpting the burlap.

12:16.875 --> 12:19.643
I essentially need to sculpt in
basic forms on the face

12:19.678 --> 12:21.077
to represent burlap.

12:21.113 --> 12:23.613
And I'm usually very receptive
to Rayce's inputs,

12:23.649 --> 12:25.849
but he's got his own aesthetic;
I have mine.

12:25.884 --> 12:26.917
It's not that I'm trying

12:26.969 --> 12:28.885
to, like, totally
disrupt your design.

12:28.921 --> 12:31.221
It would actually be
more realistic.

12:31.256 --> 12:33.640
(Logan) All right, are you
talking about starting over?

12:33.692 --> 12:35.058
To do that, yeah.

12:35.093 --> 12:36.126
Ultimately, this is my project.

12:36.178 --> 12:37.294
This is my character.

12:37.346 --> 12:39.129
It's my responsibility
and my burden.

12:39.181 --> 12:40.914
Rayce is my coach.

12:40.949 --> 12:43.066
But he's been right repeatedly.

12:43.118 --> 12:44.367
So this is challenging.

12:47.673 --> 12:48.972
(Julian)
That's looking better?

12:49.007 --> 12:50.340
Yeah, I think that's great.

12:50.375 --> 12:52.192
Looks like you're
in a good direction.

12:52.227 --> 12:53.193
Have fun.

12:53.228 --> 12:54.711
See you.

12:54.746 --> 12:55.695
See you, guys.

12:55.747 --> 12:57.247
- Later.
- See you later.

12:57.282 --> 12:58.248
- Bye.
- See you.

12:58.283 --> 12:59.549
One hour.

13:02.955 --> 13:04.821
I know I want to distort
the human face a lot.

13:04.856 --> 13:07.057
I'm just worried
about pulling it off

13:07.092 --> 13:08.742
in a way that doesn't
look goofy.

13:08.794 --> 13:10.377
I'm just starting to take
into consideration

13:10.412 --> 13:11.811
how to turn up the flow

13:11.863 --> 13:14.798
and go in and out
of the pieces of the face.

13:14.833 --> 13:16.199
I really love it.

13:23.408 --> 13:25.325
(Logan)
Day one is winding down.

13:25.377 --> 13:28.912
Finally I realize that
I originally had liked my plan.

13:28.964 --> 13:31.715
I just needed
to execute it better.

13:31.717 --> 13:34.017
There's no point in wasting time
or crying over it.

13:34.052 --> 13:36.202
And I tear the clay
all the way off

13:36.255 --> 13:38.138
to essentially just reset.

13:38.173 --> 13:40.724
This is not a great way
to start out the challenge.

13:40.759 --> 13:43.727
I look around, and I see a lot
of progress everywhere else,

13:43.729 --> 13:45.562
and zero progress on my face.

13:45.597 --> 13:47.197
That's time, everybody.

13:47.232 --> 13:48.915
(Logan)
Today is lost.

13:48.951 --> 13:50.800
And for the first time
in the competition,

13:50.802 --> 13:53.370
I'm leaving the lab
without being satisfied.

13:53.372 --> 13:54.704
And that worries me.

13:54.740 --> 13:57.274
It's too close to the finale
to be going home.

14:08.754 --> 14:09.686
Morning!

14:09.738 --> 14:10.987
(Emily)
Good morning.

14:11.023 --> 14:13.490
It's day two
of our creepy doll challenge.

14:13.525 --> 14:15.292
We have 9 1/2 hours in the lab.

14:15.294 --> 14:18.461
First thing that I need to do
is finish both of these sculpts.

14:18.513 --> 14:19.529
What I'm gonna do is

14:19.564 --> 14:21.998
have these little cracks
in certain areas.

14:22.034 --> 14:23.283
Cool.

14:23.335 --> 14:26.469
I start adding really small,
fine cracking detail,

14:26.505 --> 14:29.306
as if it's an infection
that's spreading.

14:29.341 --> 14:31.441
I'm really happy with the way
things are looking,

14:31.476 --> 14:33.276
but I do need to get
into the mold room

14:33.312 --> 14:35.045
about halfway through the day
to make sure

14:35.080 --> 14:36.079
that I have enough time

14:36.081 --> 14:38.081
to get both of the molds
ready for foam.

14:40.118 --> 14:41.584
So creepy.

14:45.791 --> 14:47.207
So you started over.

14:47.259 --> 14:49.709
Rayce notices that I've
removed the entire face.

14:49.761 --> 14:51.628
(Rayce)
What made you start over?

14:51.663 --> 14:53.063
I think I threw
clay on too fast,

14:53.065 --> 14:55.065
and it just didn't look right.

14:55.067 --> 14:56.700
I'm gonna start
with a foundation.

14:56.752 --> 14:58.668
Then, on top of that,
I can build detail.

14:58.704 --> 15:00.103
It's more authentic that way.

15:00.105 --> 15:04.107
I need to more deliberately
lay down the seams, you know?

15:05.210 --> 15:06.876
I'm a little shocked, but...

15:06.912 --> 15:08.044
I actually really like the idea

15:08.080 --> 15:09.713
that Logan decided
to start from scratch,

15:09.748 --> 15:11.448
because now he's
going to be able

15:11.483 --> 15:14.050
to put in some more
anatomically correct forms,

15:14.086 --> 15:15.185
and I think that the burlap's

15:15.187 --> 15:17.854
gonna lay over
those forms better.

15:22.627 --> 15:24.778
If you go too far
with the texture...

15:24.830 --> 15:26.329
It might come off
as, like, a wooden...

15:26.365 --> 15:28.932
It will come off as,
like, a tree-type creature.

15:28.967 --> 15:30.100
In order to give this cowl

15:30.135 --> 15:31.701
the appearance
that it's made of wood,

15:31.737 --> 15:33.319
I start sculpting lines

15:33.372 --> 15:36.189
on the side
of the back of the head.

15:36.241 --> 15:38.942
I've never sculpted hair before.

15:38.994 --> 15:42.929
And I've only just now
sculpted wood texture.

15:42.981 --> 15:45.165
So I'm trying to do
two different things

15:45.200 --> 15:48.601
that I've never done before
in one sculpt.

15:48.653 --> 15:51.838
It's a little more difficult
than I pictured.

15:57.229 --> 15:59.279
This wig is the ugliest wig
in the wig room.

15:59.314 --> 16:04.167
I'm going to create
a jute dreadlock yarn wig.

16:04.202 --> 16:07.003
I take a hideous blonde wig,

16:07.038 --> 16:09.539
cut off the top,
pre-cut some jute,

16:09.541 --> 16:11.491
and I start gluing it down,

16:11.526 --> 16:14.978
and then I start to unravel
the jute to break it up

16:15.030 --> 16:16.813
and give it more
of a distressed look,

16:16.815 --> 16:19.048
but it's taking forever.

16:19.084 --> 16:20.250
Is there a power tool

16:20.252 --> 16:21.651
or something you could use
to create it?

16:21.703 --> 16:24.154
Laura suggests
that I start sanding it.

16:24.156 --> 16:26.239
[Sander buzzing]

16:26.291 --> 16:28.074
It's working beautifully,

16:28.126 --> 16:30.610
and it's taking a lot less time.

16:33.965 --> 16:35.432
(Rayce)
I'm looking at Adam's sculpture,

16:35.434 --> 16:37.834
and there are some things
that are just

16:37.869 --> 16:39.302
really throwing me off.

16:39.337 --> 16:41.004
I think it would be wise

16:41.039 --> 16:42.722
to bring out some of the doll.

16:42.758 --> 16:44.174
I'm trying to get away

16:44.176 --> 16:46.176
from this person in a doll mask

16:46.178 --> 16:47.310
as much as I can.

16:47.345 --> 16:48.678
(Rayce)
I'm just really concerned.

16:48.713 --> 16:50.346
He could save this in the paint,

16:50.382 --> 16:52.098
but I'm really worried.

16:52.150 --> 16:54.317
You just want to be careful
with going too extreme.

16:54.352 --> 16:55.952
Rayce just keeps telling me

16:55.987 --> 16:57.804
that I may be sidestepping
the challenge

16:57.839 --> 16:59.255
and not going "doll" enough.

16:59.291 --> 17:01.691
I am going really big on this,

17:01.743 --> 17:03.993
and standing out
could put me on bottom.

17:03.995 --> 17:06.563
I just don't want to put
a big baby out on the stage.

17:06.615 --> 17:08.964
But now there's
this nagging worry.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.534
I could be just fucking this up.

17:12.671 --> 17:14.503
I don't have time
to deal with this,

17:14.506 --> 17:15.972
but at the same time, I do know

17:16.007 --> 17:18.391
that if it's not up to par
with everybody else,

17:18.443 --> 17:19.909
it could send me home.

17:19.911 --> 17:22.244
I'm just getting frustrated
at this point.

17:22.297 --> 17:24.380
I'm completely lost
with my concept.

17:30.350 --> 17:33.318
(Rayce) I'm worried about him
not reading "doll" enough.

17:33.353 --> 17:35.153
It's day two
of our creepy doll challenge,

17:35.205 --> 17:38.473
and Rayce is a little worried
that I'm not going "doll" enough

17:38.525 --> 17:40.458
and that my character
could send me home.

17:42.429 --> 17:43.544
Rayce is right.

17:43.580 --> 17:45.546
It is really pushing
the boundary

17:45.582 --> 17:46.748
of what this challenge is.

17:46.800 --> 17:49.067
But in this competition,

17:49.102 --> 17:50.868
it's more than just
addressing the challenge.

17:50.870 --> 17:53.137
It's showing who you are
as an artist.

17:53.173 --> 17:55.707
And I'm all about
pushing boundaries.

17:57.010 --> 17:58.376
I love looking different.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.645
So I decide to just
embrace this opportunity

18:00.680 --> 18:03.698
and go out of the norm
and just have fun.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.516
So I'm just moving forward.

18:15.161 --> 18:16.794
All right, I'm gonna let you go.

18:16.830 --> 18:18.379
- We'll see you, good luck.
- See you.

18:18.415 --> 18:19.414
Thank you much.

18:19.449 --> 18:20.415
See you, guys.

18:20.450 --> 18:21.416
Have fun.

18:21.468 --> 18:22.634
For my voodoo doll,

18:22.669 --> 18:23.952
I think it'd be neat
if there was a pin

18:23.987 --> 18:25.536
going through him entirely.

18:25.572 --> 18:27.939
I think that gives a more
interesting silhouette.

18:27.974 --> 18:30.141
But I need to find the lightest
weight materials possible

18:30.176 --> 18:31.209
to make this pin.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.594
I find small-gauge
armature wire,

18:33.630 --> 18:35.013
small foam tubing,

18:35.048 --> 18:37.181
and actually a clown nose
made of foam.

18:37.217 --> 18:41.219
I give it down
and start painting.

18:41.221 --> 18:43.972
I think it will definitely sell
the voodoo doll part of it,

18:44.007 --> 18:45.923
as opposed
to just a burlap doll.

18:45.959 --> 18:46.991
So I think that's something

18:46.993 --> 18:48.526
that has to be a part
of my character.

18:48.561 --> 18:49.994
(Adam)
Really like that.

18:50.030 --> 18:50.995
Thanks, man.

18:51.031 --> 18:51.996
(Adam)
Kind of want it.

18:52.032 --> 18:53.031
[Laughs]

18:56.086 --> 18:59.303
My plan for the wig
is to do a hairstyle

18:59.339 --> 19:01.639
like a porcelain doll
with the big curls

19:01.675 --> 19:03.658
and just really try
and make this wig

19:03.710 --> 19:07.328
as messy and dirty
and ugly as possible,

19:07.364 --> 19:10.448
but still kind of fitting
that doll character.

19:13.420 --> 19:14.385
Sick.

19:14.421 --> 19:15.920
[Laughs]

19:15.972 --> 19:17.255
(Emily)
We have less than an hour,

19:17.307 --> 19:19.924
and I make flat mold
specifically for the shoulder

19:19.959 --> 19:22.026
that matches up with the top
of the chest piece,

19:22.062 --> 19:23.961
and I have to get these done.

19:26.116 --> 19:27.081
Oh, shit!

19:27.117 --> 19:28.700
I just cracked my mold.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.234
The most important flat mold

19:30.236 --> 19:32.070
completely breaks
down the center.

19:32.122 --> 19:34.906
I literally do not
have time for this,

19:34.908 --> 19:36.908
so I'm just gonna scrap it,

19:36.910 --> 19:38.743
but it's not good.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.878
Shit.

19:40.914 --> 19:41.929
That's time.

19:45.635 --> 19:47.719
Now I don't have that piece.

19:47.771 --> 19:50.755
I have to figure something out
during application.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.990
I don't feel good, and it sucks.

20:01.217 --> 20:03.518
It's application day
for the doll challenge,

20:03.553 --> 20:04.886
and we have four hours
in the lab

20:04.938 --> 20:06.337
and one hour at last looks.

20:06.389 --> 20:07.588
Pretty decent.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.741
The first thing I do
is look at my foam pieces.

20:09.776 --> 20:12.276
The edges around the eye
are great,

20:12.328 --> 20:13.945
and for the most part
everything else is.

20:13.947 --> 20:15.880
Like, the wig's gonna
cover all this anyway.

20:15.915 --> 20:17.265
The edges are nice and thin.

20:17.317 --> 20:18.599
- Ew.
- [Laughs]

20:18.651 --> 20:20.685
Ew, Darla, that's sick.

20:20.737 --> 20:22.820
But if those cracks
don't stand out,

20:22.856 --> 20:25.456
then it's kind of
a wasted effort.

20:25.492 --> 20:28.643
So I need to get
these pieces applied quickly

20:28.678 --> 20:31.395
so that I leave myself a lot
of time for the paint job.

20:36.986 --> 20:38.002
How are you?

20:38.037 --> 20:39.187
- How you doing?
- I'm good.

20:39.222 --> 20:40.304
Good to see you again.

20:40.340 --> 20:43.141
So you're
a demonic porcelain doll.

20:43.176 --> 20:44.175
- It's going to be awesome!
- Yeah.

20:45.545 --> 20:46.878
(Adam)
I'm pre-painting the face piece,

20:46.913 --> 20:48.179
and the details are coming out.

20:48.214 --> 20:50.081
The tentacles look
nice and slimy.

20:50.116 --> 20:53.918
I'm also applying a black
mesh screen around one eye.

20:53.953 --> 20:55.570
This allows her
to see through it,

20:55.622 --> 20:57.171
but because there's
no light inside,

20:57.207 --> 20:58.973
it just looks
like an empty socket.

20:59.025 --> 21:00.141
- Is that comfortable?
- Yeah.

21:00.193 --> 21:01.726
I apply the face to my model.

21:01.778 --> 21:03.361
It's actually fitting
really well.

21:03.396 --> 21:05.029
I still have
to make the doll face

21:05.064 --> 21:06.247
read more "doll face."

21:06.282 --> 21:09.217
But it's looking
to be a promising character.

21:13.239 --> 21:15.606
I need to start working
on this paint job.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.475
Because this is a doll
that's supposed to be

21:17.477 --> 21:19.243
from the 17th century,

21:19.245 --> 21:23.214
I need to make sure that this
looks very, very old.

21:23.249 --> 21:25.016
It looks like old paint, right?

21:25.051 --> 21:26.217
Right.

21:26.219 --> 21:27.935
If you find the place
that just doesn't

21:27.971 --> 21:29.353
have a lot of visual interest,

21:29.389 --> 21:31.289
just cover that up, or cover it
on the top of the head.

21:31.324 --> 21:33.991
Laura suggests
I mix up some alginate

21:33.993 --> 21:36.627
and apply it
onto the foam latex.

21:36.663 --> 21:39.297
When it dries, it actually
starts to crack and shrink.

21:39.349 --> 21:41.382
And this could be
a really cool texture

21:41.434 --> 21:44.001
for chipped old paint.

21:46.222 --> 21:48.172
(Rayce) Even if it does fray
a little bit and come up,

21:48.208 --> 21:49.924
it'll actually
kind of add to the look.

21:49.959 --> 21:51.909
I start laying in the burlap
on the face.

21:51.945 --> 21:54.178
I take pieces that are bigger
than what I need,

21:54.230 --> 21:56.013
adhere them, and then trim them

21:56.065 --> 21:58.983
to sell the idea that this whole
thing is stitched together.

21:59.018 --> 22:00.067
I think it looks great.

22:05.859 --> 22:08.976
(Darla) I start sponging
on a layer of pax paint

22:09.012 --> 22:13.214
that has that sort of pink,
peach porcelain color to it.

22:13.266 --> 22:16.334
And once I get the base layer
of pax on,

22:16.369 --> 22:18.970
I use a wash
of alcohol-based paints

22:19.005 --> 22:21.455
that I've thinned down
so it's very watery.

22:21.491 --> 22:24.475
I brush this color
over the cracks,

22:24.510 --> 22:27.912
and then I use a sponge
to wipe away any of the excess.

22:27.947 --> 22:30.364
This is a little bit
of trial and error.

22:30.416 --> 22:31.849
But now that I've got
the hang of it,

22:31.885 --> 22:33.484
I'm just gonna
go to town with this.

22:33.519 --> 22:34.952
- That's really cool.
- Thank you.

22:34.988 --> 22:36.888
That's a nice effect.

22:36.923 --> 22:38.756
(Emily)
Because I scrapped the shoulder,

22:38.791 --> 22:41.392
I need to figure out
what I'm gonna do instead.

22:41.427 --> 22:43.794
So I decide to use cotton
to fill it in,

22:43.846 --> 22:45.930
because it's so much of a gap.

22:45.965 --> 22:48.866
And I add thread to the edges

22:48.918 --> 22:51.719
so it looks like the doll
has been ripped apart

22:51.754 --> 22:53.838
and all the stuffing
is coming out.

22:53.890 --> 22:57.041
So now it looks
like it's a complete character.

23:04.884 --> 23:09.604
(Julian) I start to airbrush
a mocha-brown color

23:09.656 --> 23:10.938
into all the creases,

23:10.990 --> 23:13.391
and I start dry-brushing
with a highlighted color.

23:13.443 --> 23:16.077
I've never done
this type of paint job before,

23:16.112 --> 23:17.428
so it's definitely
something new to me.

23:17.430 --> 23:18.996
But it's starting
to look pretty cool.

23:23.119 --> 23:26.070
You have to take
many steps back and squint

23:26.122 --> 23:27.738
to make sure that's
not looking muddy.

23:27.774 --> 23:29.907
Overall contrast, you need
to bring this chest out.

23:29.943 --> 23:31.092
You'd want to go in
with the blacks

23:31.127 --> 23:32.610
and spray it, though, first.

23:32.645 --> 23:33.794
Rayce is trying to explain to me

23:33.830 --> 23:35.329
what he thinks would look best,

23:35.381 --> 23:37.448
and it's just not sinking in.

23:37.500 --> 23:38.916
You're throwing
a lot of things at me.

23:38.952 --> 23:40.084
What are you thinking

23:40.119 --> 23:41.419
I'm supposed to be
doing right now?

23:41.454 --> 23:42.753
I mean, I can't even think

23:42.789 --> 23:44.455
about what I would be doing
by myself.

23:44.507 --> 23:46.123
Now I'm doubting myself.

23:46.125 --> 23:47.191
It's stressful.

23:48.695 --> 23:49.694
Ten minutes.

23:56.836 --> 23:58.552
That's time, everybody.

24:00.340 --> 24:02.423
(Logan) I am nowhere near
proud of this piece.

24:02.475 --> 24:04.125
I still have to work on the eyes

24:04.177 --> 24:06.327
and do a whole lot of work
to the mouth.

24:06.379 --> 24:07.745
I could be screwed.

24:17.090 --> 24:18.472
This is probably the most

24:18.474 --> 24:20.324
I've ever had to do
in last looks.

24:20.376 --> 24:22.376
I have to finish puppet paws,

24:22.412 --> 24:23.911
apply a face, apply a wig,

24:23.947 --> 24:25.663
and just finish the makeup.

24:25.715 --> 24:26.981
I'm sweating bullets.

24:29.102 --> 24:30.251
It doesn't look good,

24:30.253 --> 24:32.303
and I'm desperately
trying to fix it.

24:32.355 --> 24:35.439
I start with giving some depth
to the eye,

24:35.491 --> 24:36.857
and then I'm going
to be painting

24:36.909 --> 24:39.660
for the entire hour.

24:39.696 --> 24:41.062
Okay, keep your mouth
closed for a sec.

24:41.097 --> 24:43.214
I still need to attach
the doll pieces,

24:43.266 --> 24:44.999
address the back of the neck,

24:45.051 --> 24:46.534
address the front
of my model's neck,

24:46.569 --> 24:48.636
airbrush everything,
and tie it all in together.

24:48.671 --> 24:49.670
I've got a bit to do.

24:49.672 --> 24:52.273
I'm just scatterbrained
right now.

24:52.308 --> 24:54.575
Luckily I got done
with my paint job,

24:54.610 --> 24:58.179
so I'm really able to focus
on detail work.

24:58.231 --> 24:59.930
Perfect.

24:59.966 --> 25:03.150
I need to make sure
this paint job really pops.

25:03.186 --> 25:06.887
Not having the finishing details
can send you home at this point.

25:06.923 --> 25:08.372
Ten minutes, everybody.

25:17.533 --> 25:19.917
That's time, everyone.

25:19.969 --> 25:21.886
(Julian) I take a step back
and look at the makeup,

25:21.921 --> 25:24.972
and the paint job is not
exactly where I want it to be.

25:24.974 --> 25:27.108
I think it looks
a little too muddy.

25:27.143 --> 25:28.359
So I'm nervous about this.

25:37.320 --> 25:41.088
Welcome to the <i> Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

25:41.124 --> 25:44.859
As you know, one of you
will be going home tonight.

25:44.861 --> 25:46.277
But before we see
your creations,

25:46.329 --> 25:48.696
let's say hello
to our series judges.

25:48.731 --> 25:49.697
Glenn Hetrick.

25:49.732 --> 25:50.848
Good evening, guys.

25:50.883 --> 25:51.916
Good evening.

25:51.968 --> 25:52.917
Ve Neill.

25:52.969 --> 25:53.934
Hi, everybody.

25:53.970 --> 25:54.902
Hi.

25:54.954 --> 25:55.936
And Neville Page.

25:55.972 --> 25:56.921
Hello, everyone.

25:56.973 --> 25:57.905
Hello.

25:57.957 --> 25:59.573
And we are very lucky

25:59.625 --> 26:01.859
to have a special guest
joining our panel tonight.

26:01.894 --> 26:04.745
He's a true Hollywood
triple threat...

26:04.781 --> 26:07.148
writer, director,
and producer...

26:07.183 --> 26:11.085
and it just so happens
that he created the most iconic

26:11.120 --> 26:15.389
evil doll character
in film history, Chucky.

26:15.391 --> 26:18.242
Please give a warm welcome
to Don Mancini.

26:18.294 --> 26:19.593
[Applause]

26:19.629 --> 26:20.661
Thank you.

26:20.696 --> 26:22.113
Thank you guys so much
for having me.

26:22.165 --> 26:23.330
It's really exciting.

26:23.366 --> 26:25.766
(Emily)
Don Mancini created Chucky.

26:25.802 --> 26:27.752
Out of all the demonic dolls,

26:27.804 --> 26:29.804
he made the most demonic doll.

26:29.839 --> 26:30.838
It's awesome.

26:30.873 --> 26:32.339
I hope he likes mine.

26:32.392 --> 26:34.608
Thank you so much
for joining us tonight.

26:34.610 --> 26:35.910
I'm thrilled to be here.

26:35.945 --> 26:38.145
This is exactly
in my wheelhouse.

26:38.181 --> 26:39.914
I'm really curious to know

26:39.966 --> 26:41.582
what you think it is
about Chucky

26:41.584 --> 26:44.819
that has resonated
so strongly with audiences.

26:44.854 --> 26:46.520
There's something almost primal

26:46.522 --> 26:50.391
about a creature that looks
human but is not quite.

26:50.426 --> 26:51.859
I think that's
the essence of it.

26:51.894 --> 26:52.977
All right, well,
you ready to see

26:53.012 --> 26:54.161
what these guys
have come up with?

26:54.197 --> 26:55.162
Definitely.

26:55.198 --> 26:57.164
Me too; Let's do this.

26:57.216 --> 26:58.933
Julian, you're up.

27:23.693 --> 27:24.892
It's really creepy.

27:24.927 --> 27:26.727
It's just up to the judges
at this point

27:26.762 --> 27:28.129
whether it's enough.

27:48.918 --> 27:50.584
I think I did a good job.

27:50.620 --> 27:52.419
He's a scary character.

27:52.455 --> 27:55.189
I'm definitely happier
than I thought I was gonna be.

28:16.779 --> 28:17.745
I'm thrilled.

28:17.780 --> 28:19.613
She's so creepy.

28:19.649 --> 28:21.182
This is definitely
my favorite makeup

28:21.217 --> 28:22.766
that I've done
in this competition.

28:42.205 --> 28:43.837
I really love my character.

28:43.873 --> 28:46.724
She's creepy,
definitely has an impact.

29:05.962 --> 29:08.629
Everything turned out
exactly the way I envisioned.

29:08.681 --> 29:10.197
So I'm proud of it.

29:16.188 --> 29:17.521
All right, judges,
why don't you go ahead

29:17.557 --> 29:19.039
and take a closer look?

29:25.881 --> 29:27.715
(Don) It reminds me a
little bit of the zombies

29:27.750 --> 29:30.017
from John Carpenter's movie
<i>The Fog.</i>

29:30.052 --> 29:31.635
I wish that the hair
and the skin

29:31.671 --> 29:32.753
differed in tone.

29:32.755 --> 29:34.955
I just wish all the tones
had a lighter range.

29:34.957 --> 29:36.624
It does read wood grain,

29:36.676 --> 29:39.243
but there's almost
too much of it.

29:42.131 --> 29:44.498
It's kind of Chucky-esque,
isn't it?

29:44.533 --> 29:46.834
(Don) With the stitching
and the raw eye.

29:46.869 --> 29:47.968
This is awesome.

29:47.970 --> 29:49.603
I almost wish there were
a few more of them.

29:49.639 --> 29:50.604
But I love it.

29:50.606 --> 29:52.056
It's a simple solution

29:52.091 --> 29:53.924
that really helps to convey

29:53.976 --> 29:55.793
the inspiration for the makeup.

30:00.850 --> 30:02.032
(Neville)
Jeez!

30:04.053 --> 30:06.303
No, thanks.

30:06.339 --> 30:10.090
(Neville) These cracks
are so well rendered.

30:10.142 --> 30:12.026
It really looks like porcelain.

30:12.061 --> 30:13.294
(Ve)
Phenomenal.

30:13.296 --> 30:14.612
She did the wig really well.

30:14.664 --> 30:16.363
Just looks like
a filthy, dirty hair

30:16.415 --> 30:18.932
that a child's played with
forever, you know?

30:18.985 --> 30:20.100
Thank you.

30:24.640 --> 30:26.006
(Ve)
I'm kind of disappointed

30:26.058 --> 30:28.909
that this part here isn't
a little bit more realistic.

30:28.944 --> 30:31.945
It's confusing, too,
as to what's going on.

30:31.981 --> 30:33.263
These don't really look
like cracks,

30:33.299 --> 30:36.016
and this doesn't really
look like hair.

30:36.018 --> 30:37.668
I have something that looks
completely different

30:37.703 --> 30:39.036
than all the other contestants,

30:39.071 --> 30:41.522
and I'm worried that it's
so far from a makeup

30:41.574 --> 30:43.390
that it may put me
on the bottom.

30:46.896 --> 30:49.730
Tell us who made your favorite
evil doll character

30:49.732 --> 30:52.399
tonight on Twitter
using hashtag #FaceOff

30:55.441 --> 30:56.840
The hollowing out of this eye,

30:56.876 --> 31:00.544
it almost comes out of, like,
a bad pirate eye patch.

31:00.579 --> 31:03.197
All I really have on stage
is a cool concept,

31:03.249 --> 31:05.215
so I'm hoping that's enough.

31:07.753 --> 31:12.155
I love that none of the
facial features are addressed

31:12.191 --> 31:13.457
it's completely anonymous.

31:13.492 --> 31:15.709
Still, the whole thing
is so expressive.

31:15.744 --> 31:17.494
I love the way that the hair

31:17.546 --> 31:20.931
affects the entire
overall silhouette.

31:20.966 --> 31:23.066
It's not just hair.

31:23.102 --> 31:24.351
Thank you.

31:30.576 --> 31:33.360
Okay, guys, the judges would
like to speak with each of you

31:33.395 --> 31:34.895
to learn more about your work.

31:34.947 --> 31:36.313
Logan, please step up.

31:42.521 --> 31:43.804
Tell us how your voodoo doll

31:43.839 --> 31:45.555
inspired your creation
here tonight.

31:45.591 --> 31:48.391
He was a victim
of voodoo doll sorcery,

31:48.393 --> 31:51.762
so much so that he started
to become a voodoo doll himself.

31:51.797 --> 31:54.431
Now he has this misguided sense
of vengeance.

31:54.466 --> 31:57.300
I like the overall vibe
of the character.

31:59.538 --> 32:02.139
If you integrated the magical
component a little more,

32:02.174 --> 32:04.107
it would take it
away from scarecrow

32:04.143 --> 32:06.093
and more
into voodoo doll for me.

32:06.145 --> 32:08.295
But I do really like
the overall concept.

32:08.347 --> 32:09.312
Thank you.

32:09.348 --> 32:10.514
I really like this character.

32:10.566 --> 32:13.016
You did the literal translation
of the doll,

32:13.018 --> 32:14.067
but all in all,

32:14.103 --> 32:16.119
he's a darn
scary-looking dude.

32:16.121 --> 32:17.120
Good job.

32:17.156 --> 32:18.255
Thank you.

32:18.290 --> 32:22.259
The palette of this
is really fantastic,

32:22.311 --> 32:24.144
almost like
pointillistic paintings,

32:24.179 --> 32:27.030
where all the bits and pieces
create the palette.

32:27.065 --> 32:29.733
Head to toe,
it's a solid, solid character.

32:29.785 --> 32:30.734
Thank you.

32:30.786 --> 32:32.619
I feel like some
of the stitching

32:32.671 --> 32:37.073
and the raw flesh effect
around the right eye

32:37.109 --> 32:38.525
reminds me of Chucky.

32:38.560 --> 32:40.343
It reminds me of, like,
<i>Bride Of Chucky,</i>

32:40.395 --> 32:41.845
<i>Seed Of Chucky</i> era.

32:41.880 --> 32:42.829
Yeah, I dig it.

32:42.881 --> 32:43.964
Thanks very much.

32:43.999 --> 32:45.749
Logan, you can step down.

32:49.822 --> 32:50.787
Good job.

32:50.823 --> 32:52.055
Thanks.

32:52.090 --> 32:53.790
Emily, please step up.

33:03.051 --> 33:05.368
Please tell us
about your ragdoll.

33:05.404 --> 33:07.304
A mother made this doll
for her child,

33:07.339 --> 33:09.956
and then the dog
takes it outside,

33:10.008 --> 33:11.007
rips it up,

33:11.043 --> 33:12.409
and it gets all moldy and gross,

33:12.461 --> 33:14.811
and the doll gets angry,

33:14.847 --> 33:16.096
'cause she's not wanted,

33:16.131 --> 33:18.048
and starts slowly
killing the family.

33:18.083 --> 33:19.583
She is terrific.

33:19.618 --> 33:21.184
Thanks.

33:21.220 --> 33:23.320
Did you lay out crepe wool
and mold it?

33:23.355 --> 33:24.321
Mm-hmm.

33:24.356 --> 33:26.256
(Ve)
Yeah? Really clever idea.

33:26.258 --> 33:28.425
I think you did
an excellent job, darling.

33:28.460 --> 33:29.492
Thank you.

33:29.494 --> 33:31.194
(Don)
I think this is so effective.

33:31.230 --> 33:32.796
The simplicity of the face,

33:32.831 --> 33:35.582
how you just have
the button eyes

33:35.617 --> 33:37.500
and there's really no nose,

33:37.536 --> 33:40.570
I feel bad for her
as well as being spooked.

33:40.606 --> 33:41.571
I love it.

33:41.607 --> 33:42.889
Thank you.

33:42.941 --> 33:47.627
The use of the extraordinarily
long dread extensions

33:47.679 --> 33:50.046
did more than just add hair.

33:50.082 --> 33:51.765
It massively affected

33:51.817 --> 33:54.568
the overall silhouette
of the character,

33:54.603 --> 33:56.720
and that is so impactful.

33:56.755 --> 33:58.321
So I'm impressed.

33:58.357 --> 33:59.406
Thanks.

33:59.441 --> 34:00.991
Emily, please step back.

34:01.026 --> 34:02.525
Okay, thanks, Megan.

34:03.528 --> 34:04.611
Good job.

34:04.663 --> 34:05.662
Thanks.

34:08.100 --> 34:09.649
Julian, please step up.

34:15.958 --> 34:18.608
Tell us about your
ventriloquist dummy character.

34:18.610 --> 34:20.277
Back in the 1600s,

34:20.329 --> 34:22.429
a witch carved
this ventriloquist dummy

34:22.481 --> 34:25.514
out of a sacred tree
as a demonic minion.

34:25.550 --> 34:26.666
There's a few details

34:26.702 --> 34:30.170
that make it difficult
to read easily.

34:31.873 --> 34:33.857
I would probably adjust the wood

34:33.891 --> 34:36.643
so that it feels
more wood-like

34:36.678 --> 34:38.178
and maybe less textural.

34:38.230 --> 34:41.063
I also think a fake
large sculpted eye

34:41.065 --> 34:42.431
would have sold it a bit better.

34:42.484 --> 34:43.500
Okay.

34:43.534 --> 34:46.319
He almost can appear
like a zombie

34:46.371 --> 34:48.955
rather than specifically
what you're going for.

34:48.991 --> 34:50.739
This is effectively creepy,

34:50.792 --> 34:51.942
but there, for me,

34:51.976 --> 34:53.760
was a little bit
of a dissonance there.

34:53.795 --> 34:54.860
Sure.

34:54.896 --> 34:56.730
(Glenn)
It doesn't immediately convey

34:56.782 --> 34:59.232
the idea
of a carved wood puppet.

34:59.284 --> 35:01.251
Something more angular
and chiseled

35:01.286 --> 35:02.335
would have helped a lot.

35:02.371 --> 35:03.970
Also, some other tones

35:04.006 --> 35:06.289
to pull the hair
away from the face,

35:06.325 --> 35:08.124
that would have helped too.

35:08.126 --> 35:10.026
Julian, thank you.

35:10.028 --> 35:11.378
Thanks, man.

35:17.069 --> 35:18.685
All right, let's talk to Adam.

35:25.627 --> 35:28.044
Tell us how your doll
inspired your work this week.

35:28.080 --> 35:29.529
When someone touches the doll,

35:29.581 --> 35:31.247
their soul is sucked in

35:31.283 --> 35:35.018
as this stark, elemental,
greater being comes out.

35:35.053 --> 35:38.371
It's just too big conceptually.

35:40.125 --> 35:42.425
I'm just not sure
that it's that appropriate

35:42.427 --> 35:44.627
for this specific challenge.

35:44.663 --> 35:45.662
I agree.

35:45.664 --> 35:47.430
The remainder of the doll,

35:47.432 --> 35:49.399
the portion of the doll
that we still see,

35:49.451 --> 35:52.385
that should have really looked
like a rubber doll.

35:52.421 --> 35:55.221
And I also think
that these big gaping holes

35:55.257 --> 35:58.575
around the eyes
do not read "doll-like" either.

35:58.610 --> 36:01.511
You didn't quite get
to the doll zone for me today.

36:01.563 --> 36:02.679
Okay.

36:02.731 --> 36:04.147
You have to be a little bit
more conscious

36:04.182 --> 36:06.499
of what the physical
parameters are

36:06.551 --> 36:10.637
of plastic being stretched
by a demonic entity.

36:10.672 --> 36:11.938
And I think
that's what's missing,

36:11.990 --> 36:14.924
is the animated quality
of what has happened to this.

36:16.762 --> 36:18.678
Adam, please step back.

36:26.705 --> 36:28.838
Darla, please step up.

36:36.381 --> 36:38.815
Tell us about your concept,
please.

36:38.850 --> 36:40.083
She was a little girl's doll.

36:40.118 --> 36:41.568
The girl dropped her,
and she broke.

36:41.603 --> 36:42.769
So she cast it aside,

36:42.821 --> 36:45.688
and the doll found
this enchanted mirror.

36:45.741 --> 36:48.658
She uses the mirror
to attack people

36:48.693 --> 36:50.927
that are looking
in other mirrors.

36:50.962 --> 36:52.128
She's amazing.

36:52.164 --> 36:54.047
Thank you.

36:54.099 --> 36:57.667
This captures
what is fundamentally

36:57.702 --> 37:01.087
most effective about
the living doll concept

37:01.123 --> 37:02.939
and why it's
so primally frightening,

37:02.991 --> 37:06.643
because it's
so freaking disturbing.

37:06.678 --> 37:07.677
Congratulations.

37:07.729 --> 37:09.112
Thank you so much.

37:09.147 --> 37:13.817
You've managed to get
the proportions so doll-like,

37:13.869 --> 37:17.120
and the head is creepy
and swollen.

37:17.155 --> 37:18.655
It is absolutely thrilling.

37:18.657 --> 37:19.789
Thank you so much.

37:19.825 --> 37:21.825
I love the sheen on the skin.

37:21.827 --> 37:24.494
The paint job up close
is spectacular.

37:24.546 --> 37:26.162
I love the dark sockets.

37:26.164 --> 37:28.782
It just gives it
that spooky look.

37:28.817 --> 37:29.783
Holy cow, dude.

37:29.818 --> 37:30.817
I don't know how you did it.

37:30.869 --> 37:31.835
It's amazing.

37:31.870 --> 37:32.869
Thank you.

37:32.871 --> 37:34.771
Darla, please step back.

37:34.806 --> 37:36.172
Thank you, sweetie.

37:42.914 --> 37:43.847
All right, thanks, guys.

37:43.899 --> 37:45.064
Please head back
to the makeup room

37:45.100 --> 37:46.666
while the judges deliberate.

37:54.192 --> 37:55.258
All right, judges,

37:55.293 --> 37:57.710
let's talk about
tonight's evil dolls.

37:57.746 --> 37:59.996
Why don't we start with Logan's?

38:00.031 --> 38:01.548
(Ve) It was a guy
turning into a doll.

38:01.600 --> 38:02.832
He should have just said
it was a doll.

38:02.868 --> 38:04.234
(Glenn)
Right.

38:04.236 --> 38:05.869
(Neville) I really did
like the complex colors.

38:05.904 --> 38:08.121
There was purples,
and there was pinks.

38:08.156 --> 38:12.375
There was a variety that made
one harmonious palette.

38:12.410 --> 38:14.744
All right,
let's move on to Emily.

38:14.779 --> 38:17.430
(Don)
I love that simple face,

38:17.482 --> 38:19.749
but so much emotion
really comes across.

38:19.784 --> 38:21.651
I love characters
where you can see

38:21.686 --> 38:23.386
the broken heart
inside the monster,

38:23.421 --> 38:25.755
and I feel that she really
accomplished that.

38:25.790 --> 38:27.807
(Ve) How she laid those
buttons falling off

38:27.859 --> 38:29.058
and the eyelashes,

38:29.094 --> 38:31.594
everything was just
so beautifully done.

38:31.630 --> 38:34.464
All right, judges,
let's move on to Darla.

38:34.499 --> 38:36.432
(Glenn)
The porcelain and the cracks

38:36.468 --> 38:40.203
were all weathered with
really nice yellows and browns

38:40.205 --> 38:41.538
to stunning effect.

38:41.573 --> 38:43.706
That character is so creepy,

38:43.742 --> 38:45.742
so spooky, so beautiful.

38:45.777 --> 38:48.144
That could have gone
on camera right now.

38:48.180 --> 38:50.847
It's an incredibly
effective evocation

38:50.882 --> 38:52.515
of the living doll concept.

38:52.551 --> 38:55.251
All right, judges,
let's move on to Julian.

38:55.287 --> 38:57.654
(Neville) It's a good idea
to have it be so old.

38:57.689 --> 38:59.289
It takes it out of the expected.

38:59.291 --> 39:00.757
(Glenn)
But I don't think he applied

39:00.792 --> 39:02.926
the right sculptural
and painting techniques

39:02.961 --> 39:05.495
to give it the clarity
it needed to tell his story.

39:05.530 --> 39:07.864
It needed some paint
that was once there

39:07.899 --> 39:08.898
that has weathered off.

39:08.950 --> 39:11.701
Exactly, like whitewash,
like, chipped away

39:11.736 --> 39:13.069
with darker tones underneath.

39:13.104 --> 39:14.220
That would have been awesome.

39:14.256 --> 39:16.573
Shape-wise, it just
didn't work for me.

39:16.608 --> 39:19.275
All right, why don't we
move on to Adam.

39:19.311 --> 39:20.910
(Don)
I just really appreciated

39:20.946 --> 39:23.079
the originality of that idea,

39:23.131 --> 39:24.714
of a doll possessed.

39:24.749 --> 39:26.916
(Ve) But the fact that he
left one human eye in there

39:26.968 --> 39:28.668
and blocked out the other one,

39:28.720 --> 39:30.003
that made no sense to me.

39:30.055 --> 39:31.120
(Glenn)
I couldn't agree more.

39:31.156 --> 39:32.455
It looked like what it was,

39:32.490 --> 39:34.991
which was a piece of cloth
stretched across the hole.

39:35.026 --> 39:36.226
(Neville)
It was so contrived,

39:36.261 --> 39:38.328
it didn't communicate the story.

39:38.363 --> 39:40.430
All right, judges,
have you made up your minds?

39:40.432 --> 39:41.564
We have.

39:41.600 --> 39:43.299
Okay, let's bring them back out.

39:53.912 --> 39:56.379
All right, Glenn, tell us
about tonight's top looks.

39:56.414 --> 39:59.449
Emily,
you made such clever choices

39:59.484 --> 40:01.651
with your materials
and concept this week,

40:01.686 --> 40:02.685
and we thought that they

40:02.721 --> 40:04.787
complement each other
beautifully.

40:04.789 --> 40:08.174
And Darla, you nailed
the shapes of the face,

40:08.226 --> 40:11.127
and the paint job looked
like real cracked porcelain,

40:11.162 --> 40:12.528
even up close.

40:12.581 --> 40:15.064
So who is the winner
of this challenge?

40:15.100 --> 40:17.116
The winner of tonight's
challenge is...

40:23.691 --> 40:25.525
So who is the winner
of this challenge?

40:25.560 --> 40:27.426
The winner of tonight's
challenge is...

40:30.949 --> 40:32.148
Darla.

40:32.183 --> 40:33.683
[Applause]

40:33.735 --> 40:34.901
Thank you.

40:36.638 --> 40:38.271
(Glenn) People at home
may not understand

40:38.306 --> 40:40.106
how technically difficult it is

40:40.141 --> 40:42.842
to pull off that kind
of sculpting and painting.

40:42.877 --> 40:45.144
Those shapes and textures
are really tough.

40:45.146 --> 40:47.046
Unbelievable work this week.

40:47.081 --> 40:48.481
Thank you so much.

40:48.516 --> 40:50.550
I'm so excited
to win this challenge.

40:50.602 --> 40:53.486
This is a really important time
to be winning challenges.

40:53.521 --> 40:55.922
It just gives me
that extra spark.

40:55.957 --> 40:58.507
Darla, congratulations.

40:58.543 --> 41:00.426
You and Emily are safe.

41:00.461 --> 41:02.562
Logan, you are also safe.

41:02.597 --> 41:04.113
You can all head back
to the makeup room,

41:04.148 --> 41:05.364
along with your coaches.

41:08.037 --> 41:10.202
- Good luck.
- ♪♪♪

41:14.342 --> 41:15.474
Unfortunately, that means

41:15.476 --> 41:17.076
the two of you
are on the bottom this week,

41:17.111 --> 41:19.211
and one of you
will be going home.

41:19.213 --> 41:20.646
Please step forward.

41:28.256 --> 41:30.690
So, Glenn,
tell us about the bottom looks.

41:30.725 --> 41:33.826
Julian, you definitely captured
the doll in your makeup,

41:33.861 --> 41:36.762
but the shape of your face and
some of the painting techniques

41:36.798 --> 41:38.698
soften the overall image.

41:38.733 --> 41:41.601
Adam, love that
you think big-picture,

41:41.636 --> 41:43.803
and while the faraway read
was really good,

41:43.838 --> 41:46.339
there were just too many things
that didn't quite come together.

41:46.341 --> 41:48.040
So who's going home tonight?

41:48.076 --> 41:49.675
The person going home
tonight is...

41:54.449 --> 41:55.598
Adam.

41:56.884 --> 41:59.385
You have given us
some insanely cool concepts

41:59.437 --> 42:00.419
this season.

42:00.455 --> 42:01.787
But this one was just

42:01.789 --> 42:03.806
a little too far away
from this week's challenge.

42:03.841 --> 42:05.174
It's all good.

42:05.226 --> 42:08.260
Adam, I'm so sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

42:08.296 --> 42:10.229
That means, Julian,
you are safe this week

42:10.264 --> 42:11.864
and can head back
to the makeup room.

42:17.722 --> 42:19.739
Adam, I'm really sorry
to see you go,

42:19.774 --> 42:22.441
but where you're going
is probably straight to work,

42:22.477 --> 42:24.627
because you're
a very employable guy.

42:24.679 --> 42:25.995
Thank you.

42:26.047 --> 42:28.264
Adam, it's really been great
having you here with us.

42:28.316 --> 42:30.449
But if you'd please
head back to the makeup room

42:30.485 --> 42:31.984
and pack up your kit.

42:32.036 --> 42:33.285
Thanks.

42:33.321 --> 42:34.737
Good luck.

42:34.789 --> 42:36.872
(Adam) I really just wanted
to show people my designs,

42:36.908 --> 42:38.474
and I did that.

42:38.509 --> 42:40.400
They didn't like baby arms.

42:40.435 --> 42:42.469
I have no idea what's next,

42:42.470 --> 42:45.797
but I got affirmation
I can make monsters.

42:45.798 --> 42:47.324
I'm really impressed
with everything you did.

42:47.325 --> 42:49.397
I'm so thankful
for this opportunity.

42:49.398 --> 42:50.998
I've had such a great experience

42:50.999 --> 42:53.523
and I've done so many
amazing things on the show

42:53.524 --> 42:56.800
that I can't wait to see
where that takes me.
