You know you still haven't
technically said yes, right?

00:08.878 --> 00:10.880
I mean, you said, "Oh, my God,"
like, a million times

00:10.923 --> 00:12.925
and then you hugged a man
that was not me.

00:12.969 --> 00:16.190
Of course I'll marry you.
I love you, Nick.

straight here and tell my folks.

and dad of my dreams.

something.

You can't keep a secret.

That's true, Rose.

You threw me a surprise
50th birthday party

01:09.199 --> 01:11.636

the invitations.

It's Christian Dior.
But don't open it here.

01:43.668 --> 01:46.062
It's bad luck for the groom
to see the dress

01:46.106 --> 01:47.194
before the big day.

01:47.237 --> 01:49.152
Mom, I've seen pictures

pops out of the top.

in the other room, Rose.

by mistake.

08:26.810 --> 08:28.769
And then I met Shannon,

08:28.812 --> 08:32.990
and... I think I might be
in love with her, Mr. Stewart.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.341
No, Evan. You're confusing love
with dry-humping.

What's that supposed to mean?

08:59.234 --> 09:04.282
Uh... it means that you
are better off without him...

09:04.326 --> 09:06.110
I'm sorry,
I really don't know how

09:06.154 --> 09:07.895
to articulate that
any more clearly.

09:07.938 --> 09:10.201
Oh, sure. Defend him.

09:10.245 --> 09:11.463
What? No.
I was just defending you.

09:11.507 --> 09:13.291
Why? Because I'm a woman,

09:13.335 --> 09:15.555
so you don't think
I can defend myself?

09:15.598 --> 09:18.209
Are you kidding?
I am terrified of you.

09:18.253 --> 09:20.777
I'm done with men. They suck.

09:20.821 --> 09:23.911
From now on,
I'm going lesbian.

09:23.954 --> 09:25.956
[knocking on door]

09:28.306 --> 09:29.481
Ah.

09:29.525 --> 09:31.309
Too late, man,
she a lesbian now.

09:33.311 --> 09:35.313
I don't know why you're
so concerned with Shannon.

09:35.357 --> 09:36.706
Have you met her boyfriend?

09:36.750 --> 09:39.840
He's an MC and a DJ.

09:39.883 --> 09:42.930
She broke into my apartment
last night.

09:42.973 --> 09:44.932
That's awesome.

09:44.975 --> 09:46.237
I taught her

09:46.281 --> 09:49.153
how to pick locks,
just like I taught you.

09:49.197 --> 09:52.243
A dad isn't supposed to teach
their kids how to pick locks.

09:52.287 --> 09:54.071
He teaches them
how to play sports

09:54.115 --> 09:57.161
and reads them books and helps
them with their homework.

09:57.205 --> 09:59.773
Well, how am I gonna do all that
if I'm locked in a room

09:59.816 --> 10:02.384
and she can't get in?[sighs]

10:02.427 --> 10:04.560
This is exactly
why I stopped talking to you.

10:04.604 --> 10:08.303
Look, Clem, for the record,

10:08.346 --> 10:10.610
I never wanted this.

10:14.352 --> 10:16.311
Me neither.

10:16.354 --> 10:19.314
I mean, I never wanted kids.

10:21.925 --> 10:24.319
Of course that's what you meant.

10:24.362 --> 10:26.103
I knew I'd be bad at it!

10:26.147 --> 10:27.757
I didn't know what
to do with you.

10:27.801 --> 10:33.328
And after your mom died-- look,
I tried to get you other moms,

10:33.371 --> 10:35.330
but women are whack jobs.

10:35.373 --> 10:38.333
You guys are angry,
like, all the time.

10:38.376 --> 10:40.117
Has it ever occurred to you
that if all the women

10:40.161 --> 10:41.336
you know are angry,

10:41.379 --> 10:42.467
"like, all the time,"

10:42.511 --> 10:44.382
maybe it's because of you?

10:44.426 --> 10:46.428
Nah.

10:47.995 --> 10:50.345
I don't know.

10:51.346 --> 10:53.478
Maybe.

10:53.522 --> 10:57.352
You know, I used to take
Shannon to the zoo,

10:57.395 --> 10:59.528
and we'd watch the pandas
for hours.

10:59.571 --> 11:03.140
And I remember seeing this one
rocking his little cub to sleep,

11:03.184 --> 11:05.055
and I just started to cry,

11:05.099 --> 11:06.535
because
I couldn't believe

11:06.578 --> 11:08.929
that a panda was a better dad
than you.

11:08.972 --> 11:11.409
A panda.

11:11.453 --> 11:16.545
I mean, it's not like pandas
have a lot going on.

11:16.588 --> 11:20.244
You know, in spite of you,
I managed to turn out okay.

11:20.288 --> 11:22.246
But lightning
doesn't strike twice.

11:22.290 --> 11:25.249
Bring her home.

11:25.293 --> 11:27.469
Shannon needs a father.

11:27.512 --> 11:29.863
For once in your life,
try to be one.

11:31.908 --> 11:35.433
See? Women. Whack jobs.

11:39.263 --> 11:40.743
Hey, baby,

11:40.787 --> 11:43.354
I've been trying to call you.
Look how cute you look.

11:43.398 --> 11:44.312
How was your day?

11:44.355 --> 11:46.575
[grunts]

11:46.618 --> 11:48.490
That good, huh?

11:48.533 --> 11:50.535
It was awful.Aw.

11:50.579 --> 11:53.364
But I'm so glad that
we're finally alone.

11:53.408 --> 11:55.018
Mm, mm-mm.

11:55.062 --> 11:56.716
Shannon's in the other room.

11:56.759 --> 11:57.891
What?

11:57.934 --> 11:59.806
She's still here?
What happened?

11:59.849 --> 12:01.416
Well, to everyone's shock,
the drug dealer

12:01.459 --> 12:04.375
turned out not to be
a good person.

12:04.419 --> 12:05.725
Well, what is she gonna do?

12:05.768 --> 12:07.117
I don't know. I told her
she could crash here

12:07.161 --> 12:08.249
another night
till she figures it out.

12:08.292 --> 12:09.641
And when my mom
found out

12:09.685 --> 12:11.731
Shannon was here,
she invited us over for dinner.

12:11.774 --> 12:14.472
Shannon? At your parents' house?

12:14.516 --> 12:17.258
Hope your mom's making
corn dogs for dinner.

12:17.301 --> 12:20.000
Oh, my God, my wedding dress.

12:20.043 --> 12:22.437
Well, I was right.
Long, white,

12:22.480 --> 12:24.265
and the head pops
out of the top.

12:24.308 --> 12:25.570
[laughs]

12:25.614 --> 12:27.050
What the hell are you doing?

12:27.094 --> 12:28.399
What? We're having dinner
with the in-laws,

12:28.443 --> 12:29.574
and I wanted to wear
something nice,

12:29.618 --> 12:31.576
so I grabbed
this dumb old thing.

12:31.620 --> 12:33.013
It's a Christian Dior.

12:33.056 --> 12:35.755
Who cares what religion it is?

12:35.798 --> 12:38.366
Just take it off.Okay, okay. Fine.

12:38.409 --> 12:39.759
I thought you
guys would laugh.

12:39.802 --> 12:40.934
Look, Shannon,

12:40.977 --> 12:42.674
Nick's parents mean a lot to me,

12:42.718 --> 12:46.417
so tonight,
just please try not to...

12:46.461 --> 12:48.419
What, embarrass you
in front of them?

12:48.463 --> 12:50.073
I'm not a monster, Clem.

12:50.117 --> 12:52.510
I mean, look at you.

12:52.554 --> 12:54.556
You made something of yourself.

12:54.599 --> 12:56.471
I'm almost kind of happy
for you.

12:56.514 --> 12:57.907
Really? You are?

12:57.951 --> 12:59.126
Come on.

12:59.169 --> 13:00.910
Let's go find you something
to wear

13:00.954 --> 13:04.958
that's less deeply meaningful
and important to me.

13:05.001 --> 13:06.916
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:06.960 --> 13:09.310
Did you eat all of my nuts?

13:09.353 --> 13:10.354
Nick did.

13:10.398 --> 13:12.487
[laughs]
Nick ate all my pot nuts?

13:12.530 --> 13:14.054
Wait, your what nuts?

13:14.097 --> 13:17.057
My pot nuts.
Nuts with pot in them.

13:17.100 --> 13:19.624
My mari-walnuts.

13:19.668 --> 13:20.974
Oh, no.

13:21.017 --> 13:22.976
We're going
to his parents' house.

13:23.019 --> 13:25.239
Don't worry. They're super mild.

13:25.282 --> 13:28.242
Nick will be fine.

13:28.285 --> 13:30.287
[cackling]

13:32.072 --> 13:33.334
NICK:
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

13:33.377 --> 13:34.988
I know what you all
are thinking.

13:35.031 --> 13:40.297
"How did he get those olives
on his fingers?"

13:40.341 --> 13:43.561
That is absolutely not
what we were thinking.

13:43.605 --> 13:47.087
I removed the pimentos.

13:47.130 --> 13:49.698
Ah...

13:49.741 --> 13:51.265
Are you all right, son?

13:51.308 --> 13:52.919
I am bitchin', Dad.

13:52.962 --> 13:54.921
[Nick laughs]

13:54.964 --> 13:56.923
This is so lovely.
It really is.

13:56.966 --> 13:59.490
Thank you so much for
having us over for dinner.

13:59.534 --> 14:01.014
It's our pleasure.

14:01.057 --> 14:03.625
Besides, it's so wonderful
to finally meet your sister.

14:03.668 --> 14:05.932
Half sister. We
share the same dad.

14:05.975 --> 14:07.063
Oh.

14:07.107 --> 14:09.805
Who's, like, totally dead.

14:11.285 --> 14:13.461
I am so sorry about your father.

14:13.504 --> 14:15.071
How did he pass?

14:15.115 --> 14:16.681
Oh, it's-it's fine.
He was hit by a bu...

14:16.725 --> 14:18.901
Cancer. Mm-hmm.
Cancer.

14:18.945 --> 14:21.904
He was hit by
butt cancer.

14:21.948 --> 14:23.601
[laughs]

14:23.645 --> 14:25.908
[doorbell rings]

14:25.952 --> 14:27.867
Nicholas, that's not funny.

14:27.910 --> 14:30.826
We are talking
about their late father.

14:33.002 --> 14:34.264
Good evening, Officer.
Can I help you?

14:34.308 --> 14:36.701
Yeah, are, uh,
Clem and Shannon here?

14:36.745 --> 14:38.965
I'm their dad.

14:40.009 --> 14:43.056
Oh, my God, he's alive!

14:50.846 --> 14:52.195
NICK:
Clementine,

14:52.239 --> 14:53.980
you told me your dad was dead.

14:54.023 --> 14:57.853
This looks like very much
the opposite.

14:59.159 --> 15:01.204
How did you even find us?

15:01.248 --> 15:02.684
I'm a homicide detective.

15:02.727 --> 15:05.252
I have a hundred illegal ways
to track people down.

15:06.340 --> 15:07.776
What are you even doing here?

15:07.819 --> 15:10.953
That speech you gave
at the station about how Shannon

15:10.997 --> 15:14.609
was a messed up panda,
it-it got to me.

15:14.652 --> 15:16.132
I came to take her

15:16.176 --> 15:18.134
off your hands
like you begged me to.

15:18.178 --> 15:21.964
You begged Dad
to come and get me?

15:22.008 --> 15:23.923
What the hell
is wrong with you, Clem?

15:23.966 --> 15:25.185
I'm sorry. Look, I...

15:25.228 --> 15:27.187
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:28.797 --> 15:33.584
If you did not die from butt
cancer, what did you die from?

15:33.628 --> 15:36.413
Who is this guy?
He's stoned out of his gourd.

15:36.457 --> 15:37.762
He's my fiancé.

15:37.806 --> 15:40.374
And my son does not smoke pot.

15:40.417 --> 15:42.942
Oh, he didn't smoke it.
He ate it.

15:44.117 --> 15:47.424
And that is on me.
[laughs]

15:47.468 --> 15:51.820
Suddenly this evening
is starting to make sense.

15:51.863 --> 15:53.865
Why didn't you tell me
you were engaged?

15:53.909 --> 15:56.433
For the same reason that I told
everyone you were dead.

15:56.477 --> 16:00.133
Because I want nothing
to do with you.

16:00.176 --> 16:02.091
These people
are my family now,

16:02.135 --> 16:04.746
because my real one
is a disaster.

16:04.789 --> 16:06.661
Wow. You hear that, Shannon?

16:06.704 --> 16:08.489
You're a disaster.

16:11.144 --> 16:13.494
I was mostly talking
to you, Dad.

16:13.537 --> 16:17.715
Wow. You hear that, Shannon?
"Mostly."

16:17.759 --> 16:20.327
Come on, kid.Whatever.

16:20.370 --> 16:23.678
Bye, Clems.[sighs]
Shannon...

16:29.075 --> 16:31.468
Nick, I am so sorry.

16:31.512 --> 16:33.122
How could you lie
to me like that?

16:33.166 --> 16:35.559
Oh, come on.
Everyone lies a little.

16:35.603 --> 16:38.084
Even you. Like, I mean, you told
me that you've only been

16:38.127 --> 16:39.999
with five women
in your entire life,

16:40.042 --> 16:41.217
and we both know that that's...

16:41.261 --> 16:43.263
That's true.
That's true.

16:44.307 --> 16:45.787
We both know that's true.

16:45.830 --> 16:48.181
I just wish you felt like
you could be honest with me.

16:48.224 --> 16:52.141
That's all. And why are there
pimentos in my pocket?

16:53.099 --> 16:56.276
Look, I lied to you
because I was afraid.

16:56.319 --> 16:59.279
Afraid that if you knew
the truth,

16:59.322 --> 17:01.281
you wouldn't love me.

17:01.324 --> 17:03.370
Of course I'd love you.

17:03.413 --> 17:06.199
And honestly, now that I know
everything you've been through,

17:06.242 --> 17:09.724
and you still became
this amazing person,

17:09.767 --> 17:11.682
I might love you even more.

17:11.726 --> 17:13.423
[laughs softly]

17:16.339 --> 17:17.949
Is this Shannon's?

17:17.993 --> 17:20.996
Oh, she must've left it here.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.998
[gasps]

17:23.042 --> 17:25.000
Her panda.

17:25.044 --> 17:28.177
I got this for her
when she was little.

17:28.221 --> 17:31.180
I know this is hard to believe,
but she used to be

17:31.224 --> 17:33.835
the sweetest kid
in the entire world.

17:33.878 --> 17:35.880
I can totally see that.

17:37.273 --> 17:39.232
Aw, look.

17:39.275 --> 17:42.887
She tried to steal
our Nespresso machine.

17:45.325 --> 17:47.327
Shannon's all alone, Nick.

17:47.370 --> 17:49.111
Like I was.

17:49.155 --> 17:50.721
I need to be there for her.

17:50.765 --> 17:52.941
Wedo.

17:52.984 --> 17:54.116
Can we go get her?

17:54.160 --> 17:55.204
Let's go.

17:55.248 --> 17:56.423
[exhales]

17:56.466 --> 17:58.729
I am so lucky to have you.

17:58.773 --> 18:00.296
I'm the lucky one.

18:00.340 --> 18:03.299
You are seriously the most
incredible woman in the world.

18:03.343 --> 18:05.214
I'm really not.

18:05.258 --> 18:08.087
And if you'd slept with more
people, you would know that.

18:11.133 --> 18:13.918
Come on, Shannon. Open up.

18:13.962 --> 18:17.531
I would, but I'm too busy
being a disaster.

18:17.574 --> 18:19.141
[lock clicking]

18:19.185 --> 18:20.925
Huh.

18:20.969 --> 18:22.318
Haven't done that in years.

18:22.362 --> 18:24.233
What do you and Hot Sauce want?

18:24.277 --> 18:26.017
You left your backpack.

18:26.061 --> 18:28.150
Whoa, whoa.

18:28.194 --> 18:30.326
What happened
to my Nespresso machine?

18:32.198 --> 18:34.200
We want you
to come live with us.

18:34.243 --> 18:35.810
[scoffs]
Hard pass.

18:35.853 --> 18:37.855
My life is Gucci.

18:37.899 --> 18:40.423
No, Shannon,
your life is not Gucci.

18:40.467 --> 18:41.859
I know, because I had it.

18:41.903 --> 18:43.339
I drank a lot,

18:43.383 --> 18:46.386
I smoked a lot,
I hooked up with a...

18:47.691 --> 18:49.345
...fair amount.

18:50.868 --> 18:53.044
And after all that, you know
what I ended up getting?

18:53.088 --> 18:54.742
HPV?

18:55.960 --> 18:58.528
No. No.

18:59.834 --> 19:02.141
What I got was nothing.

19:02.184 --> 19:07.276
I had to figure everything out
the hard way, and it sucked.

19:07.320 --> 19:09.496
You could use
an older sister.

19:09.539 --> 19:13.021
Sister? That means nothing.

19:13.064 --> 19:16.242
Dad knocked up two different
women, and we popped out.

19:16.285 --> 19:18.635
There's probably 20 more
running around New York

19:18.679 --> 19:20.724
that look vaguely like us.

19:20.768 --> 19:23.205
Hey, of all the places
you could've broken into,

19:23.249 --> 19:25.207
you broke into
your sister's apartment.

19:25.251 --> 19:27.166
That means something.

19:29.037 --> 19:31.300
Look, I used to think
family meant nothing, too.

19:31.344 --> 19:34.216
But then I met this guy,
and I realized

19:34.260 --> 19:37.001
that family is everything.

19:38.394 --> 19:40.701
No one says "family" anymore.

19:40.744 --> 19:42.703
It's just "fam."

19:43.921 --> 19:45.749
Come on. Go get your stuff.

19:45.793 --> 19:46.968
Let's go home.

19:47.011 --> 19:49.100
Are you guys sure about this?

19:51.015 --> 19:53.975
We have never been less sure

19:54.018 --> 19:57.021
about anything
in our entire lives.

19:59.415 --> 20:03.245
[laughs]

20:03.289 --> 20:05.465
I knew she was a hugger.

20:05.508 --> 20:08.207
Guess who's coming in
to get some.

20:08.250 --> 20:10.209

20:16.040 --> 20:18.608
♪ Zip me to the zop ♪ Oh

20:18.652 --> 20:22.133

20:23.396 --> 20:25.354
What?

20:25.398 --> 20:27.791
So I put some mari-walnuts
on their salad.

20:27.835 --> 20:29.228
I got to find
some way to make

20:29.271 --> 20:31.142
these family dinners
interesting.

20:33.449 --> 20:35.277
Thank you
for letting her stay here.

20:35.321 --> 20:36.626
I couldn't say no.

20:36.670 --> 20:38.628
Well, you could have.

20:38.672 --> 20:40.935
Now, see, I did not know that.
