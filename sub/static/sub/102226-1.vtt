01:11.079 --> 01:11.879
[door slams]

01:12.560 --> 01:14.719
[Terry] For God's sake, Carol, please.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.959
Can't... We've got all our
money wrapped up in this...

01:21.239 --> 01:24.040
Carol... Please think again

01:25.719 --> 01:27.400
[Carol] This house is evil.

01:27.640 --> 01:28.960
[Terry] But what about our money?

01:29.319 --> 01:32.239
So what if we just moved in? I don't care.

01:33.280 --> 01:34.519
Get rid of it!

01:35.599 --> 01:37.719
[Carol] Where did all
those photos come from?

01:38.400 --> 01:39.959
I didn't stab myself.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.680
I've had it with you.

01:45.760 --> 01:46.719
I'm terrified.

01:48.519 --> 01:49.920
[Terry] Give me another chance.

01:50.200 --> 01:51.200
Never.

01:51.760 --> 01:53.480
[Carol] Sell the bloody house!

02:32.199 --> 02:33.280
Hey, Terry.

02:34.240 --> 02:35.400
Hey, Terry!

02:55.240 --> 02:56.400
[floorboards creak]

Laura?

[door knocking]

05:22.439 --> 05:23.800
[knock, knock]

05:24.399 --> 05:25.319
'Right...

05:25.680 --> 05:26.600
Coming...

05:27.079 --> 05:30.079
[walking downstairs, opening door]

05:38.079 --> 05:40.240
[Peter] As you can see,
the house is almost done.

05:40.639 --> 05:43.160
[Mr Blake] Can I take a look at the office?

05:45.319 --> 05:47.199
[Peter] How did you know it was an office?

05:47.360 --> 05:49.319
I used to live around here.

05:50.439 --> 05:52.639
It would be great
to line up a buyer, Mr...?

05:53.399 --> 05:54.560
Mr Blake.

05:56.199 --> 05:57.920
You've done quite a bit...

05:58.199 --> 05:59.519
- erm...
- Oh, Peter.

06:03.399 --> 06:05.639
Is there anything you
can tell me about the garden?

06:05.959 --> 06:07.639
No... bodies in there then?

06:07.879 --> 06:09.120
[laughs]
Well, er...

06:09.519 --> 06:11.040
Well you never know.

06:11.160 --> 06:12.360
That would be an extra.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.560
[clears throat]
So um...

06:16.240 --> 06:18.160
How come you didn't buy
when you had the chance?

06:18.299 --> 06:19.700
Too much DIY for me.

06:20.580 --> 06:21.480
That's my trouble...

06:21.560 --> 06:24.199
I take on things and I end up
completely out of my depth.

06:24.480 --> 06:25.280
Yeah.

06:25.399 --> 06:26.720
I could say the same.

06:27.480 --> 06:29.839
So how come you've
ended up as the decorator?

06:30.160 --> 06:31.160
You don't look like one.

06:31.240 --> 06:32.040
Ah, well...

06:33.240 --> 06:35.600
The boss thought we could
save some money, so...

06:37.439 --> 06:38.879
I can't actually believe...

06:40.120 --> 06:41.920
Well, this is the last room I've got to do.

06:44.399 --> 06:45.720
As you can see, the...

06:47.160 --> 06:48.920
The lawn's become quite a tip.

06:50.319 --> 06:51.600
I'm going to leave that for her.

06:53.519 --> 06:54.720
You should be all right.

07:00.680 --> 07:01.480
[Peter] Yeah...

07:02.879 --> 07:04.319
That seemed to come from nowhere.

07:06.179 --> 07:07.940
Leave... Right now.

07:10.680 --> 07:11.480
Look, I...

07:11.600 --> 07:14.000
I'm pretty sure she used to
live in my neighbour's house.

07:14.480 --> 07:16.959
You shouldn't listen to
other people's tales, Peter.

07:18.759 --> 07:20.506
It hardly matters now, does it?

07:20.572 --> 07:22.319
They always get the stories wrong.

07:23.279 --> 07:24.199
[chuckles]

07:24.439 --> 07:25.959
This is... is just a leftover.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.079
OK?

07:27.879 --> 07:29.399
This is not a happy home.

07:29.680 --> 07:31.000
Well this home is all we have.

07:33.240 --> 07:35.680
We can't go back to the old life,
there's only...

07:37.199 --> 07:38.519
Well, there's only this.

07:39.480 --> 07:41.680
Perhaps you can make a go of it elsewhere?

07:42.439 --> 07:43.239
No...

07:43.519 --> 07:44.319
No.

07:45.519 --> 07:47.839
Our... our goals are mis-matched now.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.279
Laura was never the one to...

07:51.439 --> 07:52.959
Go and take such a risk, like...

07:53.480 --> 07:54.920
You know, buying a house.

07:55.720 --> 07:57.800
There's a difference between gambling

07:58.079 --> 08:00.480
and taking a leap of faith, Peter.

08:01.079 --> 08:01.879
[Peter huffs]

08:02.680 --> 08:04.199
She was always the calm,

08:05.319 --> 08:06.240
considered one.

08:06.480 --> 08:07.280
You know?

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
But now...

08:12.040 --> 08:13.560
Can't say I blame her.

08:14.560 --> 08:15.439
I'll turn up...

08:15.800 --> 08:17.934
- When you're further down the road.
- [car door slams]

08:18.000 --> 08:19.279
Oh, shit.

08:22.639 --> 08:23.759
[sighs]

08:28.439 --> 08:30.279
[Blake] Do yourself a favour Peter,

08:30.560 --> 08:32.320
don't stay the night.

08:47.799 --> 08:50.639
What the hell, Peter,
it's a bloody tip out here.

08:51.360 --> 08:53.320
You can call the skip people on Monday.

09:05.559 --> 09:07.399
[walking upstairs]

09:11.799 --> 09:13.159
Don't you want to sell it?

09:13.679 --> 09:15.200
Actually a guy popped round just now.

09:15.320 --> 09:17.679
Made some interesting noises.
Said his name was Mr Blake.

09:17.919 --> 09:19.799
Did you get his contact details?

09:20.120 --> 09:22.639
He said he'd contact us
when we're further down the road.

09:24.060 --> 09:25.859
I can't believe you didn't get his number.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.360
Didn't you see him on your way in?

09:29.080 --> 09:29.919
No?

09:30.840 --> 09:32.799
Ah, well, he has to be in the house.

09:39.519 --> 09:41.120
[door slamming, walking]

09:50.159 --> 09:51.879
Right, don't know where he went to.

09:53.919 --> 09:54.919
It's weird.

09:57.720 --> 09:59.420
So... Why you here?

09:59.759 --> 10:01.600
Did I leave my phone here yesterday? My-

10:01.840 --> 10:03.279
my work one's just about had it.

10:03.360 --> 10:04.879
Why have you brought your suitcase?

10:07.159 --> 10:09.960
- I thought you were finishing today...
- I never told you that.

10:14.320 --> 10:15.720
After this room, I'm out.

10:19.879 --> 10:20.759
I know.

10:22.039 --> 10:23.759
I'm to blame for losing the first house.

10:28.279 --> 10:31.559
Well I hope it makes you happy
since it's the last thing we do together.

10:34.440 --> 10:36.360
I just don't want to argue any more.

11:30.799 --> 11:32.360
[Laura laughs]

11:33.879 --> 11:34.879
What's so funny?

11:35.080 --> 11:36.679
My sister says hello.

11:36.919 --> 11:38.120
That's awfully nice of her.

11:38.600 --> 11:39.679
Found your phone.

11:41.240 --> 11:42.040
Hmm...

11:42.240 --> 11:43.799
Why haven't you changed the screen?

11:46.639 --> 11:49.360
I think I might a new house
once we've sold this one.

11:49.559 --> 11:51.840
Give us a chance to fail
at this one first, hey, Laura.

11:52.399 --> 11:53.919
Look Laura, you take the bed.

11:54.080 --> 11:54.960
You sure?

11:55.960 --> 11:56.799
I insist.

11:57.080 --> 11:58.679
It's my last night anyway, so.

12:01.279 --> 12:02.639
Is this the new mattress?

12:03.240 --> 12:05.720
Bloody hell, I'm not sleeping
on that, it stinks.

12:05.879 --> 12:08.480
-Where's the number for the mattress people
-Why buy a new one?

12:08.639 --> 12:11.000
Because houses sell better
with new furniture in them.

12:14.480 --> 12:16.720
- What's this betting app doing on my phone?
- Here.

12:17.059 --> 12:19.339
Oh... ha... wow.

12:19.440 --> 12:21.480
Yeah great, you've done
something on the list.

12:21.600 --> 12:24.559
Number one, take the stuff from
the garage and put it into boxes.

12:24.759 --> 12:25.559
That's great.

12:26.799 --> 12:28.639
Can't you just go to your parents, please?

12:28.960 --> 12:31.320
Can't you get the money back
from your friend for the ring?

12:31.440 --> 12:35.080
- He was going to pop by today...
- My dad needs the deposit this weekend.

12:37.159 --> 12:38.919
You, you can have your bed back.

12:39.840 --> 12:41.440
I meant to ask you about this.

12:43.320 --> 12:46.039
Ha... no idea, sorry.
Where did you get it from?

12:46.519 --> 12:48.039
Via the curtains.

12:50.240 --> 12:51.440
I'm a hundred percent certain

12:51.600 --> 12:54.200
that this is the girl who used
to live in Terry's house, right?

12:55.279 --> 12:56.440
This morning...

12:57.240 --> 12:58.759
He tells me she's haunting it.

13:01.919 --> 13:04.559
Something happened over there,
that he's just not letting on.

13:06.759 --> 13:09.879
I've never seen a man
shake like that Laura, he was... terrified.

13:11.759 --> 13:13.679
Right, so they want to move out...

13:14.120 --> 13:15.519
And now you believe in ghosts?

13:15.720 --> 13:18.440
Well of course not, but it was
alarming to see them so frightened.

13:18.679 --> 13:20.360
That and the very real prospect of them

13:20.559 --> 13:22.519
losing the money on their property.

13:25.159 --> 13:28.000
Too far from the family
is the normal excuse.

13:29.679 --> 13:30.479
Look...

13:30.799 --> 13:33.559
Terry's already complained to my
manager that I mis-sold the house.

13:34.279 --> 13:36.840
But why would this photo just
randomly appear here?

13:40.159 --> 13:42.320
Look, just forget about it, it's rubbish.

13:43.840 --> 13:46.159
I bet it's Terry planting these photos.

13:46.440 --> 13:47.960
Why the hell would he do that, Laura?

13:48.120 --> 13:49.679
'Cos he realises he's made a mistake

13:49.799 --> 13:51.519
and he's just looking for someone to blame.

13:53.399 --> 13:55.279
Are you really scared?

13:57.559 --> 13:58.840
Not of ghosts.

13:59.519 --> 14:01.799
You know we can make
a good profit on this house.

14:04.039 --> 14:05.840
Anyway, you can have the bed.

14:06.399 --> 14:07.600
Where are you going to sleep?

14:08.159 --> 14:09.600
On the clean sofa.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.120
Right...

14:14.480 --> 14:15.559
Cheers then.

14:16.879 --> 14:18.360
At least she left the pillows.

14:29.440 --> 14:34.679
[running outside]

15:13.645 --> 15:14.645
[girl] Mum?

15:19.160 --> 15:20.160
[curtains closing]

15:22.000 --> 15:22.960
[footsteps]

15:24.840 --> 15:25.799
[door opening]

15:26.440 --> 15:27.799
[Laura] Peter, did you hear that?

15:27.960 --> 15:29.879
There's voices,
I could hear voices up here.

15:31.840 --> 15:32.640
[huffs]

15:34.360 --> 15:35.519
You didn't hear anything?

15:35.759 --> 15:36.679
It wasn't you?

15:37.080 --> 15:38.639
Have I ever talked in my sleep, Laura?

15:38.759 --> 15:39.559
No.

15:40.879 --> 15:43.200
- Laura, will you just go back...
- Shh, shh.

15:44.159 --> 15:45.879
[running outside]

15:47.360 --> 15:49.000
It's probably just someone outside.

15:49.360 --> 15:50.480
Just stay here.
[huffs]

16:11.879 --> 16:13.279
Peter?

16:15.200 --> 16:16.639
Peter?

16:18.000 --> 16:18.800
[door closes]

16:20.320 --> 16:22.080
Peter?

16:23.240 --> 16:24.040
[click]

16:25.120 --> 16:26.879
Peter?

16:36.320 --> 16:38.180
- Here...
- You sure you didn't hear anything?

16:38.919 --> 16:39.719
[Peter sighs]

16:43.039 --> 16:44.600
Different place, different noises.

16:45.140 --> 16:46.220
Don't go.

16:48.480 --> 16:49.559
You'll be fine.

16:50.419 --> 16:51.699
Why did you really come?

16:54.539 --> 16:55.699
You know why.

16:56.360 --> 16:57.720
Just give up the blanket.

17:10.680 --> 17:11.799
What?

17:14.759 --> 17:15.680
Lights.

17:17.839 --> 17:19.119
They're still there.

17:22.200 --> 17:23.640
[sigh]
Thought they'd gone?

17:35.799 --> 17:37.799
[Laura] What if that's man you met earlier?

17:38.000 --> 17:38.800
- Mr Blake?
- Yeah.

17:39.079 --> 17:39.879
Hardly.

17:46.519 --> 17:48.839
Oh, this is ridiculous, it has to be Terry.

17:50.640 --> 17:52.880
[Peter] Look, I'll go over there
to make sure it's them.

17:53.039 --> 17:55.079
If it's them, I'll make sure they're OK.

17:57.140 --> 17:59.194
[Laura] No, I'll go
I want to have it out with him.

17:59.260 --> 18:00.100
[Peter] Really?

18:00.200 --> 18:02.880
Let's see if it really is
the same girl he's been going on about.

18:03.359 --> 18:04.680
What if it's a burglar?

18:05.559 --> 18:06.880
If it's your Mr Blake,

18:07.039 --> 18:07.960
then you can rush over.

18:11.839 --> 18:13.240
[door closes]

18:14.119 --> 18:15.319
[Peter] Bloody hell, Laura.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.440
[dramatic music]

19:00.519 --> 19:03.000
[Laura] I've got to get up in the morning.

19:19.359 --> 19:20.559
Laura.

19:23.400 --> 19:24.839
You have to see this.

19:29.160 --> 19:29.960
[Laura sighs]

19:30.319 --> 19:31.200
Bring it over.

19:33.079 --> 19:34.079
Found this in the...

19:34.359 --> 19:35.400
other curtain.

19:40.960 --> 19:42.279
You're not gonna like it.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.920
This is Mr Blake.

19:47.799 --> 19:49.640
Our prospective buyer?

19:52.200 --> 19:54.079
Do you think he took the other photo?

19:55.559 --> 19:57.519
Don't look to me for answers, Laura.

19:58.119 --> 20:00.759
What did he say when he
turned up this afternoon?

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Do you think he could
be the child's father?

20:04.920 --> 20:07.839
He was unusually
disturbed by that first photo.

20:15.079 --> 20:17.960
There's something very
suspicious about this Blake guy.

20:18.599 --> 20:20.299
- What are you doing?
- [curtains]

20:20.640 --> 20:22.279
See if another photo appears.

20:22.440 --> 20:24.519
[laughs] Out of thin air?

20:26.400 --> 20:28.480
It's been a very strange day, Laura.

20:29.319 --> 20:30.559
And it's only midnight.

20:31.400 --> 20:32.200
[sighs]

20:32.279 --> 20:33.200
Is that all?

20:40.359 --> 20:41.159
Blake...

20:42.440 --> 20:43.640
Pass me your laptop.

20:48.319 --> 20:50.559
Blake... we don't have his first name.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.480
That and the street name...

20:57.599 --> 20:59.039
should turn something up.

21:01.119 --> 21:01.919
Here.

21:02.599 --> 21:04.599
This is the only search result.

21:38.200 --> 21:39.799
What's a Ghost Girl?

21:43.039 --> 21:44.240
What the hell, Laura?

21:44.960 --> 21:46.160
Blake's a murderer?

21:47.640 --> 21:48.799
That's rubbish.

21:48.920 --> 21:51.039
It says a child murderer lived here.

21:51.480 --> 21:52.359
Here!

21:54.119 --> 21:55.640
Is that why the house was so cheap?

21:58.720 --> 22:00.799
Blake's name would have been on the deeds.

22:01.319 --> 22:02.880
If he'd owned it before.

22:06.920 --> 22:08.480
This is the story of the Ghost Girl.

22:08.839 --> 22:10.799
She peeks through curtains
searching for the...

22:11.799 --> 22:13.519
person who killed her.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.720
I had no idea.

22:20.400 --> 22:21.960
I didn't know anything about this.

22:22.960 --> 22:25.160
[Peter] Losing money on the house
is all that scares me.

22:27.599 --> 22:30.359
Well, ghosts and murderers scare me.

22:31.160 --> 22:33.160
[Peter] We haven't actually seen any.

22:36.359 --> 22:37.960
Do you think it's true?

22:40.000 --> 22:41.720
Let's not find out tonight.

22:43.039 --> 22:44.759
It's only going to stress us out.

22:46.240 --> 22:47.799
We bury the stories.

22:48.759 --> 22:51.279
Focus on...
getting the house on the market.

22:55.240 --> 22:56.920
Why have these photos turned up today?

22:58.039 --> 22:59.720
Why did Blake turn up today?

23:01.079 --> 23:02.400
Why d'you think?

23:03.319 --> 23:04.759
Or was he just being nosy?

23:06.839 --> 23:09.319
Maybe he was looking for evidence
that could incriminate him,

23:09.480 --> 23:11.960
and he's trying to cover it up.
We should go to the police.

23:13.240 --> 23:15.000
After eight years?

23:21.720 --> 23:24.240
Look, nothing's going to change
between now and the morning.

23:24.599 --> 23:25.399
OK?

23:26.000 --> 23:27.599
Battery's dying anyway.

23:37.440 --> 23:40.920
Oh, God, I've bought a monster of a house.

23:43.519 --> 23:45.240
What are we gonna to do?

23:46.279 --> 23:47.079
Look...

23:48.680 --> 23:50.599
We finish this room.

23:51.200 --> 23:52.880
And we put it on the market.

23:53.519 --> 23:54.680
Bit by bit.

23:55.079 --> 23:56.680
Just like you used to say.

24:00.359 --> 24:02.440
That bloody thing can go for a start.

24:03.680 --> 24:04.480
Oh...

24:04.900 --> 24:07.340
Yeah... I found this thing...

24:07.499 --> 24:08.780
behind the radiator.

24:11.920 --> 24:13.319
Oh, if my mum bought me this,

24:13.680 --> 24:15.400
I would definitely ask for my money back.

24:15.559 --> 24:16.920
[laughs] I can believe that.

24:17.400 --> 24:18.200
Ergh

24:19.799 --> 24:20.599
Oh...

24:22.480 --> 24:24.079
Just remembered where it'd come from.

24:25.880 --> 24:27.319
Poor girl.

24:28.920 --> 24:30.839
She looked so happy
with him in the pictures.

24:32.920 --> 24:34.119
However she died.

24:35.759 --> 24:37.319
It's all a bit gruesome.

24:38.640 --> 24:39.440
Here look.

24:40.160 --> 24:41.079
Out of sight.

24:48.519 --> 24:49.640
[footsteps]

24:53.480 --> 24:54.599

24:58.359 --> 24:59.480

26:31.440 --> 26:33.680
She must be the woman
who owned Terry's house.

26:34.680 --> 26:35.480
You know her?

26:37.240 --> 26:39.400
They didn't say anything
about a granddaughter.

26:41.839 --> 26:44.960
First I heard about the little girl,
is... is from Terry.

26:46.040 --> 26:49.239
Look. Terry's probably
reading the same website.

26:49.940 --> 26:52.100
Take it as fable until we know more.

26:53.799 --> 26:55.279
I don't know what to think.

26:55.799 --> 26:57.759
[Peter] You'll see it
differently in the morning

26:59.519 --> 27:00.480
[sighs]

27:02.640 --> 27:04.759
We're never gonna sell this place.

27:07.440 --> 27:09.599
There are no ghosts, Laura.

27:10.799 --> 27:12.200
We never believed in that stuff.

27:12.599 --> 27:13.400
Come on.

27:17.400 --> 27:18.799
[knock, knock, knock, knock]

27:22.440 --> 27:23.839
It has to be the front door.

[knock, knock, knock]

27:28.160 --> 27:29.079
[knock, knock]

27:30.240 --> 27:31.799
No, it's the windows.

27:32.480 --> 27:33.480
It's the windows.

27:42.680 --> 27:44.240
[Laura] They might go away.

27:47.880 --> 27:49.240
Maybe it's Blake?

27:49.680 --> 27:51.359
Or Terry, it could be Terry?

27:55.440 --> 27:57.480
Who'd knock in the middle of the night?

27:58.519 --> 27:59.319
You did.

27:59.519 --> 28:00.319
[laugh]

28:00.960 --> 28:01.760
Shh..

28:05.680 --> 28:06.880
Sounds like they've given up.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.920
Come on, go back to sleep.

28:14.039 --> 28:14.960
Come on.

28:46.880 --> 28:48.720

30:46.400 --> 30:48.119
How the hell did it get there!

30:48.200 --> 30:49.799
- Get it away from me!
- It's gone.

30:49.880 --> 30:51.039
It's just a crappy toy!

30:51.160 --> 30:52.400
Christ, what you doing now?

30:52.480 --> 30:53.599
It was in the bed!

30:53.720 --> 30:55.039
I've got to get out of here!

30:55.160 --> 30:56.519
You must have been dreaming!

30:56.640 --> 30:58.000
I knew would say that!

30:58.160 --> 30:59.160
I've got to get out!

30:59.359 --> 31:00.799
Right we're leaving, we're leaving.

31:00.880 --> 31:02.640
Come on, we've had enough of this place.

31:02.720 --> 31:03.799
You don't believe me!

31:03.880 --> 31:05.680
I don't want to see you upset, come on.

31:06.039 --> 31:07.480
[Peter] It's OK, look...

31:11.759 --> 31:13.319
OK, it's the wrong head.

31:13.839 --> 31:16.319
If we ever get out here,
don't employ me as a handyman OK?

31:16.880 --> 31:18.519
OK, it must be broken from the...

31:18.920 --> 31:20.000
from the inside.

31:20.960 --> 31:22.560
OK, there's only one thing for it, babe.

31:22.920 --> 31:23.720
OK?

31:23.799 --> 31:24.599
OK?

31:25.519 --> 31:26.319
No, not again.

31:26.480 --> 31:28.359
Peter I don't care
about the house or anything.

31:28.440 --> 31:30.080
I don't care either, I don't care either.

31:30.160 --> 31:31.720
Don't go out there, it's too dangerous.

31:32.000 --> 31:32.800
Don't you trust me?

31:32.920 --> 31:35.480
Don't you believe me?
That I saw a ghost, I saw a ghost in here.

31:35.759 --> 31:37.400
I believe you saw something, Laura.

31:38.039 --> 31:39.720
It's not good enough, Peter.

31:40.240 --> 31:41.680
I don't want to stay in here myself.

31:41.799 --> 31:43.079
I'll be two minutes, OK?

31:43.200 --> 31:45.519
Emily! Her name was Emily.
She told me her name was Emily.

31:45.599 --> 31:48.000
Listen, listen, I forgot to tell you
what I found OK outside.

31:48.079 --> 31:50.519
There was a couple coming back
from something or other right?

31:50.599 --> 31:51.440
I spoke to them.

31:51.720 --> 31:52.759
The guy told me about...

31:53.599 --> 31:55.039
a crazy woman who lived on our road.

31:56.079 --> 31:57.279
Come on, come on...

31:58.759 --> 31:59.839
Apparently...

32:00.759 --> 32:02.400
she would dress up as her daughter.

32:03.440 --> 32:06.599
And wander the streets asking if
anyone had seen her little girl.

32:08.079 --> 32:09.599
She would post photos through...

32:10.200 --> 32:11.759
doors and any open windows.

32:13.620 --> 32:15.393
When she started knocking
on doors and becoming

32:15.459 --> 32:17.560
threatening, they called the police.

32:18.119 --> 32:21.119
His son took this photo.
Asked him to email it to me.

32:25.440 --> 32:26.400
[sigh] Right.

32:27.440 --> 32:29.440
They heard that she killed Mr Blake.

32:31.279 --> 32:32.279
So it's true?

32:32.799 --> 32:33.599
[chuckles]

32:34.559 --> 32:35.440
Well it can't be true.

32:35.839 --> 32:37.119
Because I was with Blake today.

32:37.480 --> 32:38.960
Maybe he was a ghost?

32:40.599 --> 32:41.399
[huffs]

32:43.799 --> 32:46.680
We need to get out of this room Laura,
it will clear our heads.

32:47.880 --> 32:50.720
Whatever the stories are,
they could cost us the house.

32:52.839 --> 32:54.079
What happened to her?

32:54.960 --> 32:55.880
She killed herself.

32:55.960 --> 32:57.200
- In here?
- No...

32:57.920 --> 32:59.079
Hospital apparently.

33:02.559 --> 33:04.799
Look, we're stuck in this room
and you wanna to stay?

33:07.680 --> 33:08.519
Yes.

33:11.759 --> 33:12.680
Yes.

33:13.039 --> 33:14.480
You don't get it, do you?

33:15.559 --> 33:17.359
If we hadn't given up the first time...

33:19.039 --> 33:20.200
we'd still be together.

33:21.480 --> 33:22.839
Look, I saw her.

33:25.039 --> 33:26.400
I saw her outline.

33:26.559 --> 33:28.000
- Are you sure, Laura?
- Yes

33:29.359 --> 33:30.519
Let's find out.

33:40.599 --> 33:41.839
Battery's gone.

33:43.680 --> 33:45.319
What you're doing...

33:46.480 --> 33:47.680
It's not gonna work.

33:52.359 --> 33:53.759
What's in there?

33:54.039 --> 33:55.160
I told you.

33:57.359 --> 33:58.759
There's nothing.

34:04.359 --> 34:07.519
Can't find...
wha... what's this?

34:12.480 --> 34:15.639
[rummaging in wardrobe]

34:31.559 --> 34:32.359
Um...

34:33.880 --> 34:36.320
It's to Emily, from Mr Blake.

34:36.760 --> 34:37.560
"Dear Emily...

34:38.480 --> 34:39.800
I hope you're well...

34:40.219 --> 34:41.419
I hope you're...

34:42.399 --> 34:44.439
settling in at your grandparents...

34:45.380 --> 34:46.820
I hope you won't blame me...

34:47.159 --> 34:47.960
about..."

34:48.159 --> 34:49.159
Uh..

34:50.159 --> 34:51.760
I can't read the rest.

34:54.526 --> 34:56.526
[scrape]

34:59.719 --> 35:00.960
The picture frame's moved.

35:16.760 --> 35:18.239
"Love Emily."

35:23.760 --> 35:25.079
"Dear Mr Blake...

35:27.159 --> 35:30.159
I'm hiding my letter so
mummy doesn't find it...

35:31.159 --> 35:32.880
You know what she's like...

35:33.519 --> 35:36.559
I don't want you to get hurt like daddy."

35:40.039 --> 35:42.079
"Happy ninth birthday, Emily."

35:43.880 --> 35:45.119
Hold on...

35:55.079 --> 35:55.920
'Right, so...

35:56.880 --> 35:57.960
Emily survived.

35:58.440 --> 36:00.000
And moved in with her grandparents.

36:01.920 --> 36:03.800
I've seen this before.

36:06.679 --> 36:08.039
Not a copy but...

36:08.599 --> 36:10.360
When I moved the bed from the other room,

36:11.079 --> 36:13.000
I found an envelope with a...

36:13.360 --> 36:16.480
a letter opener stabbed through it.
Inside was a letter just like this one.

36:17.480 --> 36:18.679
Of course, you threw it away.

36:19.199 --> 36:20.000
Yeah.

36:21.639 --> 36:22.920
Let's keep searching.

36:30.239 --> 36:31.639
Hey, another one.

36:33.960 --> 36:36.960
"Dear Mr Blake, mummy's gone funny.

36:38.559 --> 36:41.559
Please take me away, please hurry.
Please, Emily."

36:43.920 --> 36:45.760
So Blake was helping Emily?

36:46.960 --> 36:47.880
He saved her.

36:49.960 --> 36:52.639
- I don't know what to think with these...
- Just keep looking.

36:53.719 --> 36:54.519
If Blake...

36:54.760 --> 36:55.560
had...

36:55.960 --> 36:59.400
Emily taken away by social services, that
would give the mother reason to harm him.

36:59.480 --> 37:00.280
Right?

37:03.760 --> 37:04.639
Hey.

37:07.599 --> 37:09.000
I'll find something to fish it out.

37:15.960 --> 37:17.039
Got it.

37:21.400 --> 37:22.639
Lovely.

37:24.840 --> 37:26.079
"Dear Mr Blake...

37:26.239 --> 37:28.280
Please keep mummy's toy safe...

37:28.719 --> 37:30.039
Mummy says I must not...

37:32.039 --> 37:34.159
Burn it... must not burn...

37:34.679 --> 37:36.000
Nannie... for she...

37:36.239 --> 37:37.840
er, will be mad.

37:38.159 --> 37:39.199
Love, Emily"

37:39.559 --> 37:40.719
Who the hell is Nannie?

37:42.679 --> 37:43.719
That's Nannie.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
"Nannie is always watching...

37:55.239 --> 37:58.239
Mummy says its eyes are
watching me all the time...

37:58.599 --> 38:00.239
Please Mr Blake...

38:00.880 --> 38:01.960
hide Nanny...

38:02.360 --> 38:05.880
or... she'll find out where she is."

38:09.920 --> 38:11.199
'Right so...

38:11.719 --> 38:13.280
So... is the mother dead or alive?

38:14.119 --> 38:15.800
And why did she disappear?

38:17.119 --> 38:19.000
[sighs] Well did she...

38:19.760 --> 38:21.360
Did she say anything?

38:23.920 --> 38:25.639
Mummy's going to get you.

38:26.800 --> 38:28.159
I bet she killed Blake.

38:28.679 --> 38:30.480
That's just hearsay again, Laura.

38:31.400 --> 38:33.239
The only one who knows is Emily.

38:34.280 --> 38:35.239
We should go.

38:36.440 --> 38:38.360
If the ghost thinks her
daughter's been murdered

38:38.440 --> 38:40.960
we can convince Emily to come here.

38:41.440 --> 38:42.760
And why would we do that?

38:42.960 --> 38:45.740
Don't you think that's just...
I don't know, a little bit thoughtless?

38:46.039 --> 38:48.320
Evidence that her daughter is still alive,

38:48.519 --> 38:50.039
could, could make her go away.

38:50.199 --> 38:53.199
I mean, she could have killed
herself to be with her in the afterlife.

38:53.800 --> 38:56.440
- But of course, she's alive.
- After life?

38:57.159 --> 38:57.959
Really?

38:58.559 --> 38:59.559
What about Blake?

39:02.039 --> 39:03.679
He came here to help us.

39:04.639 --> 39:06.519
You're making it up as you go along.

39:07.880 --> 39:09.280
Get a breather.

39:10.199 --> 39:11.320
Get out of this room...

39:12.360 --> 39:13.400
this house...

39:13.480 --> 39:14.559
this street - OK?

39:16.400 --> 39:19.079
Blake wants her to go, then he can go too.

39:19.639 --> 39:21.119
We need expert help on this.

39:21.440 --> 39:23.280
I understand you've seen things.

39:24.360 --> 39:25.719
I do, but...

39:26.199 --> 39:28.639
I saw the man alive and well today.

39:36.519 --> 39:38.239
It's really weird.

39:39.840 --> 39:42.559
When the mother was attacking me,
she was...

39:44.559 --> 39:47.679
She was like solid, like a-
-a real person but...

39:48.719 --> 39:50.039
Spongy...

39:50.320 --> 39:51.199
[laughs]

39:52.719 --> 39:53.960
Can't explain.

39:56.400 --> 39:57.880
Shaking Blake's hand...

39:59.920 --> 40:01.320
that was weird.

40:02.920 --> 40:04.280
Spongy like you say.

40:09.880 --> 40:11.360
He must be a ghost too.

40:13.199 --> 40:14.199
[sighs]

40:18.760 --> 40:20.080
I'm going to find Emily's number.

40:21.159 --> 40:23.800
Don't you think the
girl's gone through enough?

40:24.079 --> 40:25.239
Gonna email...

40:25.760 --> 40:27.599
her grandparents.

40:29.920 --> 40:30.840
Got it.

40:31.599 --> 40:32.920
What are you going to say?

40:33.559 --> 40:35.199
I'll just make it up as I go along.

40:36.039 --> 40:37.320
No surprise there, then.

40:48.400 --> 40:49.200
Done.

40:50.960 --> 40:53.440
I've asked her to contact me a.s.a.p.

40:56.239 --> 40:57.599
Alright... Let's go.

40:59.760 --> 41:00.760
Shit.

41:01.800 --> 41:02.679
What?

41:05.320 --> 41:06.480
Oh, it's locked.

41:07.959 --> 41:09.319
No, it's too dangerous.

41:21.800 --> 41:23.560
[huffs, groans]

41:26.239 --> 41:27.039
[crash, fall]

41:29.320 --> 41:30.840
No, no, it's OK, it's just a...

41:31.440 --> 41:32.519
Er, it's just a sprain.

41:34.079 --> 41:35.159
I knew it.

41:35.440 --> 41:36.240
[gasp]

41:37.440 --> 41:38.240
No, wai...

41:38.320 --> 41:39.120
I'm come...

41:39.599 --> 41:40.399
Wait!

41:40.480 --> 41:41.800
Argh... I'll get you out.

41:42.400 --> 41:43.200
OK.

41:46.920 --> 41:47.920
[sigh]

41:53.119 --> 41:53.919
Come on...

41:57.119 --> 41:58.119
Phone dad.

41:58.399 --> 42:00.240
[phone rings]

42:03.840 --> 42:04.640
[phone cut off]

42:09.079 --> 42:09.880
Come on!

42:12.119 --> 42:12.960
[sighs]

42:23.920 --> 42:25.239
[huffs]

42:28.480 --> 42:29.360
Phone Terry...

42:33.079 --> 42:36.840
[phone ringing]

42:41.280 --> 42:43.400
[phone] Hello, this is Terry
please leave a message.

42:43.880 --> 42:45.000
Oh, shit...

42:46.159 --> 42:47.000
Come on...

42:49.440 --> 42:52.920
[phone ringing]

42:53.239 --> 42:54.039
[Terry] Hello?

42:54.159 --> 42:56.519
Hello? Hi, it's, it's, it's Laura.

42:56.639 --> 42:58.599
Er, Peter and Laura from across the road?

42:58.719 --> 42:59.599
Oh, God.

42:59.840 --> 43:01.039
Where are you?

43:01.199 --> 43:03.000
What the bloody hell's it to do with you?

43:03.199 --> 43:04.360
I'm phoning because there...

43:04.440 --> 43:06.239
There are lights on in your house.

43:07.039 --> 43:08.559
Why did you leave so quickly?

43:08.719 --> 43:10.239
Why do you think?

43:11.000 --> 43:12.159
I'm sorry... um...

43:12.639 --> 43:13.760
We didn't believe you.

43:14.079 --> 43:15.679
Oh, now you do believe me.

43:16.320 --> 43:18.280
Do you know anything about
the previous owners?

43:20.260 --> 43:22.359
Have you ever met... a Mr Blake?

43:22.920 --> 43:24.800
Wasn't he your previous occupant?

43:25.639 --> 43:26.800
How would you know that?

43:27.079 --> 43:29.119
We went to your place first.

43:29.320 --> 43:30.800
Mr Blake turned up this afternoon,

43:31.119 --> 43:31.919
and...

43:32.280 --> 43:35.039
he spoke to Peter and said he was
interested in buying the house.

43:35.239 --> 43:36.533
Impossible. He's dead.

43:36.599 --> 43:38.519
No... it was...

43:38.679 --> 43:41.360
It was definitely him that
turned up this afternoon.

43:42.199 --> 43:45.079
If I was you, I'd find Peter and leave now.

43:45.719 --> 43:46.880
I can't get out.

43:47.960 --> 43:48.760
Look...

43:49.800 --> 43:50.600
Just...

43:51.199 --> 43:53.400
Please tell me why you left so quickly.

43:54.239 --> 43:56.880
Well... it started with the
occasional photograph.

43:57.199 --> 43:58.960
Of a mother and little girl.

44:01.199 --> 44:04.039
There was an unearthly
scream early this morning.

44:04.760 --> 44:06.400
I rush back upstairs.

44:06.960 --> 44:09.440
Poor Carol's been stabbed in the leg.

44:11.119 --> 44:13.079
And she tells me she was attacked by a...

44:13.199 --> 44:14.400
black shadow.

44:14.719 --> 44:16.199
Who was shouting at her.

44:16.679 --> 44:18.679
"Where's my little girl?"

44:19.599 --> 44:21.599
God knows what was going on.

44:21.960 --> 44:25.519
I'm sorry, that's awful. Is she OK?

44:26.360 --> 44:28.440
I'm... I'm so sorry.

44:29.079 --> 44:31.360
I have to admit,
I don't know what to think.

44:32.159 --> 44:33.960
But I have to believe her.

44:34.679 --> 44:37.360
Have you, have you any idea why
this would happen here?

44:37.840 --> 44:39.519
We had no idea.

44:39.800 --> 44:41.960
We're gonna sell it cheap
to those builders.

44:42.679 --> 44:45.119
And if I was you, I'd do the same.

44:50.480 --> 44:51.480
God...

44:54.360 --> 44:55.360
[sniffle]

45:04.079 --> 45:06.239
Oh... my God.

45:06.679 --> 45:08.840
[dramatic music]

45:36.679 --> 45:39.000
[creak noises]

45:43.079 --> 45:45.400
[creepy voice] Emily...

45:45.599 --> 45:47.239
[Laura cries]

45:47.320 --> 45:48.800
[weird voice] Emily?

45:51.760 --> 45:53.760
[weird voices] Emily? Emily?

45:54.840 --> 45:58.440
[crying]

46:11.199 --> 46:13.199
[ghostly hiss]

46:28.639 --> 46:29.440

46:38.039 --> 46:38.840

46:44.199 --> 46:45.000
[light thump]

46:48.239 --> 46:49.039
[light thump]

46:58.960 --> 46:59.760
[light thump]

48:12.320 --> 48:13.639
[silence]

48:16.840 --> 48:18.159
Peter!

48:21.320 --> 48:22.559
[girl] Mum?

48:23.280 --> 48:24.080
Peter?

48:25.960 --> 48:27.320
Peter!

48:27.800 --> 48:28.960
[girl] Mummy?

48:31.639 --> 48:32.719
Peter!

48:33.119 --> 48:34.400
[girl] Peter?

48:41.380 --> 48:43.580
- [girl whispers] Where's my little girl?
- [creak]

48:44.400 --> 48:45.360
[woman] Emily?

48:55.480 --> 48:57.599
[woman] Emily? Emily?

49:01.719 --> 49:02.719
[girl] Mum?

49:03.679 --> 49:04.639
[vocal noise]

49:05.440 --> 49:06.719
[dramatic music]

49:25.240 --> 49:26.040
[Laura cries]

49:26.199 --> 49:27.719
[girl shouts] Where is she?

49:30.079 --> 49:30.879
[scratch]

49:34.519 --> 49:35.360
[banging on door]

49:35.719 --> 49:36.519
Peter!

49:39.000 --> 49:40.840
- Is... is that you?
- [curtains]

49:42.920 --> 49:44.000
Hurry!
- [curtains closing]

49:44.480 --> 49:45.519
[Peter behind door]
Yeah.

49:46.239 --> 49:47.079
[door handle rattle]

49:47.239 --> 49:48.079
Please!

49:49.280 --> 49:52.559
- [Peter] It appears to be stuck.
- Yes, we know.

49:54.280 --> 49:56.199
Did you want me to have a go?

49:56.679 --> 49:58.400
Have you got the right screwdriver?

49:58.559 --> 50:00.559
Brought the whole bloody toolbox with me.

50:02.880 --> 50:04.000
It's not that.

50:04.599 --> 50:06.400
[rummaging through toolbox]

50:07.280 --> 50:08.199
Shit.

50:10.719 --> 50:11.920
Hang on a minute.

50:14.360 --> 50:15.400
Laura?

50:17.719 --> 50:19.320
Here... this is yours.

50:26.000 --> 50:27.400
I'm so sorry.

50:31.840 --> 50:33.599
I wish we could start again.

50:37.239 --> 50:38.519
- But we... [bang]
- [woman] No!

50:38.679 --> 50:39.960
Peter? - Peter!

50:40.559 --> 50:41.760
[woman] You killed her!

50:41.920 --> 50:43.000
Peter!

50:43.159 --> 50:44.079
Answer me!

50:44.159 --> 50:45.480
Peter!

50:49.599 --> 50:50.399
[girl screams]

50:50.519 --> 50:51.920
- [bang]
- [Laura] Oof!

50:52.599 --> 50:53.880
[girl shouts] Say it!

50:54.920 --> 50:56.639
[girl] You killed my Emily.

51:01.320 --> 51:05.679
[huffs and groans]

51:10.480 --> 51:11.440
[gasp]

51:14.920 --> 51:15.880
[argh]

51:23.800 --> 51:24.760
[argh]

51:35.280 --> 51:36.320
Laura?

51:41.960 --> 51:43.819
- [ahh...]

52:07.480 --> 52:08.280
Laura!

52:15.199 --> 52:16.039
Laura...?

Hello?

53:06.719 --> 53:08.239
[teenager on phone]
Is Laura there?

53:09.480 --> 53:10.280
I don't know.

53:10.760 --> 53:11.679
I don't know?

53:12.079 --> 53:13.613
[Emily phone]
It's Emily. I'll phone later.

53:13.679 --> 53:14.800
Oh, no, wait. I'm her...

53:15.920 --> 53:17.000
I'm her friend.

53:18.079 --> 53:19.440
I saw her email.

53:19.559 --> 53:20.400
Oh.

53:20.960 --> 53:21.960
Right.

53:22.599 --> 53:23.760

Emily...

53:27.800 --> 53:28.760
I've got to go.

53:30.079 --> 53:31.239
Please, you could, er...

53:32.079 --> 53:34.000
You could really help us with this,
it's urgent.

53:34.199 --> 53:35.000
Hold on.

Mummy's going to get you.

54:02.800 --> 54:05.679
[woman]
You killed my Emily.

54:14.679 --> 54:16.119
[grunts]

54:16.599 --> 54:17.480
No... [grunts]

54:17.880 --> 54:19.199
- Stop!
- Tell me!

54:19.639 --> 54:21.280
Where's my little girl?

54:22.039 --> 54:23.719
[grunts, groans]

54:29.320 --> 54:30.120
Stop!

54:31.119 --> 54:31.919
Say it!

54:32.760 --> 54:35.039
Mummy's going to kill you!

54:35.559 --> 54:36.639
Emily's alive!

54:36.719 --> 54:38.119
Liar... Liar!

54:38.199 --> 54:39.440
What did you do to Laura?

54:39.559 --> 54:42.160
- You killed my little girl.
- We...

54:42.319 --> 54:43.839
[phone rings]

54:44.599 --> 54:45.560
Didn't!

54:45.840 --> 54:49.360
[phone rings]

54:50.840 --> 54:51.840
[grunts]

54:56.599 --> 54:58.119
Emily?

55:00.280 --> 55:01.360
Hello?

55:03.239 --> 55:04.199
[Emily] Yeah.

55:04.400 --> 55:05.519
Listen, um...

55:06.639 --> 55:08.559
Laura thought you could help us.

55:08.840 --> 55:09.840
We bought.

55:10.000 --> 55:11.440
Mr Blake's house.

55:12.440 --> 55:13.719
- Your mother...
- She's dead.

55:18.360 --> 55:20.400
Emily, do you know
what really happened to her?

55:21.000 --> 55:24.199
- You're one of those journalists.
- No, no...

55:25.599 --> 55:26.400
We think

55:26.679 --> 55:28.119
she killed Mr Blake.

55:28.760 --> 55:30.119
No mummy didn't.

55:31.679 --> 55:32.599
[Emily] Who's that?

55:33.400 --> 55:34.360
We found your...

55:34.599 --> 55:35.960
your toy, the Sock Puppet?

55:36.320 --> 55:39.519
You killed my Emily.

55:39.800 --> 55:41.013
It was called Nannie?

55:41.079 --> 55:42.559
[screams, groans]

55:43.800 --> 55:44.679
[woman] Tell me!

55:44.960 --> 55:46.320
She made it to keep an eye on you.

55:46.719 --> 55:48.000
[Emily] How did you know that?

55:48.639 --> 55:49.599
[woman] Emily?

55:51.159 --> 55:52.039
[Emily] Who's that?

55:52.400 --> 55:53.239
Emily.

55:54.960 --> 55:56.679
[Emily] Who's that other person?

55:56.800 --> 55:57.639
Em...

55:59.400 --> 56:00.519
Can you remember?

56:00.960 --> 56:02.440
[Emily] It wasn't Mr Blake's fault.

56:03.320 --> 56:05.239
Mum used to frighten me.

56:06.480 --> 56:07.280
[Peter] Why?

56:08.360 --> 56:09.519
[Emily] When my dad died,

56:10.840 --> 56:12.679
she used to make me play in the rain.

56:15.519 --> 56:17.719
She was having a difficult time.

56:20.039 --> 56:22.000
I don't know why she hated him so much.

56:22.719 --> 56:24.159
[Peter] Was he a kind man?

56:24.880 --> 56:26.920
[Emily] He gave me a camera
for my birthday.

56:28.480 --> 56:30.119
He let me print the photos...

56:31.360 --> 56:34.079
She didn't want me going round his house.

56:35.079 --> 56:37.159
So she broke my camera.

56:39.880 --> 56:42.679
Then she gave me the sock puppet.

56:44.119 --> 56:46.639
It was to watch me, she said.

56:47.639 --> 56:49.880
She was obsessed with the thing.

56:53.599 --> 56:55.679
It was supposed to make you love me.

57:01.000 --> 57:02.880
[Emily] I went to live with my
grandparents.

57:03.920 --> 57:07.360
Mr Blake saw her dressing up
in my old Halloween costume.

57:10.599 --> 57:12.559
I suppose she was just missing me...

57:14.920 --> 57:16.559
I guess I'll never know.

57:20.159 --> 57:21.400
My little girl.

57:23.239 --> 57:25.360
[Peter] Your daughter's
got a life of her own now.

57:28.679 --> 57:29.639
Go.

57:37.079 --> 57:38.119
[Emily] Hello?

57:38.400 --> 57:40.519
- I'm sorry er...
- [Emily] Um...

57:41.159 --> 57:42.000
[Emily] OK.

57:44.440 --> 57:46.480
I don't really know why I said all that.

57:48.599 --> 57:50.320
Perhaps it was time.

58:02.559 --> 58:03.760
Laura.

58:14.480 --> 58:15.440
Laura.

58:25.599 --> 58:26.800
She's not with you?

58:27.559 --> 58:28.519
Is she?

58:29.519 --> 58:30.559
Laura!

58:39.719 --> 58:40.599
No.

58:40.665 --> 58:42.665
[rustle]

58:45.159 --> 58:47.280
[Mr Blake] I saw her walking up the road.

58:51.840 --> 58:54.280
We all walk up the road eventually.

58:59.920 --> 59:02.079
It was Emily's mother, Peter.

59:03.960 --> 59:05.239
What, she killed you?

59:05.400 --> 59:07.559
My heart condition did that for me.

59:08.599 --> 59:10.480
She helped it on, though.

59:11.559 --> 59:13.760
When the mother
was having one of her spells...

59:14.119 --> 59:16.119
Emily used to hide under her bed.

59:17.400 --> 59:19.559
And under that one too.

59:20.320 --> 59:22.960
Her mother tried to scare me off
by hiding under it.

59:24.039 --> 59:25.559
But why did she want to kill us?

59:25.920 --> 59:27.159
She's a vengeful ghost.

59:27.599 --> 59:29.320
You know how it goes.

59:30.880 --> 59:32.599
Get rid of that thing, Peter.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.039
It's the link between us and you.

59:35.440 --> 59:38.599
Emily's puppet allows
her mother to form into a solid being.

59:38.920 --> 59:40.239
She's gone now.

59:40.559 --> 59:41.679
I beat her.

59:42.480 --> 59:43.559
Burn it.

59:52.760 --> 59:54.840
It's time for all of us to move on.

1:00:23.599 --> 1:00:24.399
No...

1:00:25.320 --> 1:00:26.599
She's mine now.

1:00:28.320 --> 1:00:30.039
[grunts, groans]

1:00:30.559 --> 1:00:31.440
[huffs]

1:00:31.800 --> 1:00:32.679
Please...

1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:33.840
Stop!

1:00:34.639 --> 1:00:35.519
[grunts]

1:00:38.079 --> 1:00:39.320
Stop.

1:00:42.039 --> 1:00:42.839
No...

1:00:42.920 --> 1:00:44.159
[ghost cries]

1:00:46.800 --> 1:00:49.039
[argh... ] Give it...

1:00:49.960 --> 1:00:51.559
This is for Laura!

1:00:57.800 --> 1:00:58.840
[ghost] No...

1:01:04.880 --> 1:01:07.119
[theme music]

1:01:44.200 --> 1:01:47.900
[music]

1:02:00.400 --> 1:02:03.719
[sound of car arriving and stops]

1:02:05.239 --> 1:02:07.559
[car doors open and close]

1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:10.800
[dog barks]

1:02:11.159 --> 1:02:13.519
[approaching footsteps, rolling suitcase]

1:02:13.800 --> 1:02:15.239
[keys jangle]

1:02:19.320 --> 1:02:20.360
[front door opens]

1:02:20.519 --> 1:02:22.360
[Mum] Welcome to our new home, kids.

1:02:22.639 --> 1:02:24.960
- [children] Yay!
- [running in house, dog barks]

1:02:28.719 --> 1:02:31.039
[child running upstairs]

1:02:31.159 --> 1:02:32.039
[Child] Yay.

1:02:32.480 --> 1:02:33.280
[Mum] Thomas!

1:02:33.519 --> 1:02:35.119
[doors opening and closing]

1:02:35.320 --> 1:02:36.239
[Dad] Hey...

1:02:36.519 --> 1:02:37.400
[a door closes]

1:02:37.960 --> 1:02:39.960
Come on back down.

1:02:41.840 --> 1:02:43.280
[running upstairs]

1:02:44.400 --> 1:02:45.559
What are you doing?

1:02:45.679 --> 1:02:48.679
[Child]
There's a nice little lady upstairs.

1:02:48.960 --> 1:02:52.079
[Dad laughs]
Don't be so silly, there's no one there.

1:02:52.760 --> 1:02:55.360
[Child] But she smiled at me.

1:02:55.599 --> 1:02:58.119
[Mum calls]
Hey, you two!

1:02:58.559 --> 1:02:59.719
[Dad] Come on,

1:03:00.800 --> 1:03:02.719
let’s have a picnic in the garden.

1:03:04.039 --> 1:03:06.719
[Child] Aw... OK.
