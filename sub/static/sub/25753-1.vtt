00:12.501 --> 00:15.720
- [Narrator] In 1972 an
eerie abomination made it's

00:15.720 --> 00:19.264
first appearance on theater
screens across America.

00:19.264 --> 00:21.371
It was the subject of a movie titled

00:21.371 --> 00:24.169
The Legend of Boggy Creek.

00:24.169 --> 00:25.985
The creature at the heart of this legend

00:25.985 --> 00:28.902
was dubbed The Boggy Creek Monster.

00:30.128 --> 00:32.064
While a nation came to meet this beast

00:32.064 --> 00:34.779
for the first time in the early 1970's,

00:34.779 --> 00:37.417
residents in the bottom
lands of southern Arkansas

00:37.417 --> 00:40.740
barely batted an eye at
it's cinematic debut.

00:40.740 --> 00:42.454
They knew something
the rest of the country

00:42.454 --> 00:44.419
was just beginning to grasp.

00:44.419 --> 00:48.751
See, the Legend of Boggy
Creek wasn't just a legend.

00:48.751 --> 00:51.508
For decades, reports of a huge manlike

00:51.508 --> 00:54.051
hair covered beast who wandered the swamps

00:54.051 --> 00:58.483
and waterways had seeped
into local folklore.

00:58.483 --> 00:59.808
While the excitement of the film

00:59.808 --> 01:02.139
appealed to the general public,

01:02.139 --> 01:03.881
those who had actually encountered

01:03.881 --> 01:08.048
the monster for themselves
were haunted by it's reality.

01:09.271 --> 01:11.655
The reality was a riddle.

01:11.655 --> 01:13.905
The reality was terrifying.

01:15.937 --> 01:18.854
(fast paced music)

02:03.703 --> 02:06.370
(ominous music)

02:17.982 --> 02:19.969
This is Fouke Arkansas.

02:19.969 --> 02:21.380
I didn't grow up here,

02:21.380 --> 02:22.574
but when I was just a boy

02:22.574 --> 02:25.498
this place captured my imagination.

02:25.498 --> 02:27.555
I had only seen it on the theater screen,

02:27.555 --> 02:29.858
but I had often traveled
to such small towns

02:29.858 --> 02:32.204
with my father as we camped and hunted

02:32.204 --> 02:34.916
throughout Texas and Arkansas.

02:34.916 --> 02:36.733
They were out of the way places.

02:36.733 --> 02:39.036
Quiet monuments of rural America

02:39.036 --> 02:42.490
tucked away from the
hectic buzz of city life.

02:42.490 --> 02:45.109
A peaceful place to raise a family.

02:45.109 --> 02:49.276
And for a lot of people,
that's all Fouke ever was.

02:50.205 --> 02:53.059
In the 70's Fouke would
gain notoriety however,

02:53.059 --> 02:56.461
thanks to the release of
The Legend of Boggy Creek.

02:56.461 --> 02:58.897
I saw the movie at the
time with my family,

02:58.897 --> 03:01.384
and like a lot of kids
fascinated by monsters

03:01.384 --> 03:02.634
I was thrilled.

03:03.594 --> 03:05.075
The movie has since become something

03:05.075 --> 03:06.687
of a B movie staple.

03:06.687 --> 03:10.859
But it's magic and mystery
has always remained with me.

03:10.859 --> 03:13.959
A mystery I wanted to help solve.

03:13.959 --> 03:15.730
I'm Lyle Blackburn.

03:15.730 --> 03:17.902
A few years ago I wrote a book titled

03:17.902 --> 03:20.044
The Beast of Boggy Creek.

03:20.044 --> 03:22.558
The book takes an in depth
look at the mysteries

03:22.558 --> 03:24.321
surrounding the town of Fouke.

03:24.321 --> 03:27.077
And in particular, it's
most famous citizen,

03:27.077 --> 03:29.077
the Boggy Creek Monster.

03:30.527 --> 03:32.127
For people in southern Arkansas,

03:32.127 --> 03:33.771
the legend of Boggy Creek was more

03:33.771 --> 03:35.374
than just a movie.

03:35.374 --> 03:37.549
It was an introduction to their home.

03:37.549 --> 03:40.538
An area often overlooked by outsiders.

03:40.538 --> 03:43.377
A land teeming with
wildlife, natural beauty,

03:43.377 --> 03:46.710
hidden mysteries, and countless legends.

03:48.129 --> 03:49.688
Fouke is a quiet little community

03:49.688 --> 03:52.470
tucked away in the corner
of southwest Arkansas.

03:52.470 --> 03:54.723
Just 20 miles from the city of Texarkana,

03:54.723 --> 03:58.546
60 miles north of Shreveport Louisiana.

03:58.546 --> 04:00.525
Despite it's proximity to relatively

04:00.525 --> 04:02.629
large population centers,

04:02.629 --> 04:04.900
the remote wilderness that surrounds Fouke

04:04.900 --> 04:08.257
makes it feel like a world away.

04:08.257 --> 04:10.406
- Fouke Arkansas is located in the

04:10.406 --> 04:14.917
southwest corner of the state
of Arkansas in Miller County.

04:14.917 --> 04:17.798
Miller County is the only
county in the state of Arkansas,

04:17.798 --> 04:20.420
or one of the two counties
in the state of Arkansas

04:20.420 --> 04:23.520
that is separated from the
rest of the state by water.

04:23.520 --> 04:28.176
Red River carves it out away
from the rest of the state.

04:28.176 --> 04:31.287
- This area, we sometimes look at

04:31.287 --> 04:35.126
as the lost county of the
lost state of Arkansas.

04:35.126 --> 04:38.078
- It's a small country town.

04:38.078 --> 04:40.150
Slow slow paced.

04:40.150 --> 04:42.507
Small town that we have here has got

04:42.507 --> 04:45.944
plentiful (stutters) wildlife around here.

04:45.944 --> 04:47.492
When you step out in the woods

04:47.492 --> 04:49.325
you experience nature.

04:51.295 --> 04:53.233
- [Lyle] Fouke was
founded in the late 1800's

04:53.233 --> 04:55.247
by a group of 7th Day Adventists

04:55.247 --> 04:57.462
looking for religious sanctuary.

04:57.462 --> 04:59.285
A place where the devil and his minions

04:59.285 --> 05:00.974
could not reach them.

05:00.974 --> 05:03.886
The rugged lands of Miller
County which surrounded it

05:03.886 --> 05:06.758
were often the back drop
for shadowy activities.

05:06.758 --> 05:09.056
Like so many areas of the deep south

05:09.056 --> 05:11.401
it was home to moonshiners, outlaws,

05:11.401 --> 05:13.841
and other unscrupulous individuals.

05:13.841 --> 05:17.266
Yet Fouke held it's ground
as a faith based community.

05:17.266 --> 05:20.771
Where families can enjoy the
benefits of small town life.

05:20.771 --> 05:23.354
- It is a place in it's history

05:24.903 --> 05:27.153
that was known for outlaws.

05:28.445 --> 05:31.032
And many of them would
hang out in this area

05:31.032 --> 05:33.717
because they could access another state

05:33.717 --> 05:36.085
in less than 15, 20 minutes.

05:36.085 --> 05:37.918
- And the town itself,

05:39.291 --> 05:41.175
Fouke used to be a big place.

05:41.175 --> 05:44.756
We had a train depot, we had a saw mill.

05:44.756 --> 05:47.175
And it was a lot more people down here

05:47.175 --> 05:49.049
then than there is now.

05:49.049 --> 05:50.444
- [Lyle] While Fouke has become known

05:50.444 --> 05:52.177
in modern times for it's monster,

05:52.177 --> 05:53.835
the state of Arkansas has a long

05:53.835 --> 05:56.807
running history with
strange creature reports.

05:56.807 --> 05:58.874
While researching for my book,

05:58.874 --> 06:00.521
I came across numerous articles

06:00.521 --> 06:03.004
glean from newspaper archives that talk

06:03.004 --> 06:06.024
of terrifying encounters
with man-like beings

06:06.024 --> 06:08.787
who lurk in the depths
of the states mountains,

06:08.787 --> 06:10.454
forests, and swamps.

06:11.305 --> 06:14.398
As far back as the
1800's, newspapers carried

06:14.398 --> 06:17.244
tales of these so called wild men.

06:17.244 --> 06:20.749
- They're stories that
come from the early 1900's.

06:20.749 --> 06:23.252
The Indians believed it's
been here the whole time.

06:23.252 --> 06:27.004
Their ancestors lived with
whatever this creature is.

06:27.004 --> 06:29.219
It's second nature to 'em.

06:29.219 --> 06:30.925
- [Lyle] The wild man
descriptions are remarkably

06:30.925 --> 06:33.158
similar to Fouke's monster.

06:33.158 --> 06:35.264
While there are an
abundance of historically

06:35.264 --> 06:38.090
documented sightings connected with Fouke,

06:38.090 --> 06:40.530
stories from the locals
suggest this creature

06:40.530 --> 06:42.006
may have been sighted in the area

06:42.006 --> 06:44.673
as far back as the early 1900's.

06:46.193 --> 06:49.236
- 100 years ago there was
something that happened down here.

06:49.236 --> 06:52.873
It happened to a girl,
she was eight years old.

06:52.873 --> 06:55.026
She's been gone for about 14 years.

06:55.026 --> 06:56.835
She died at the age of 92.

06:56.835 --> 06:58.954
And she didn't tell
anybody anything about this

06:58.954 --> 07:01.064
until she was on her deathbed.

07:01.064 --> 07:04.842
She had been fishing with her
grandparents and her parents.

07:04.842 --> 07:08.198
They all fished right along
the bayou, right through here.

07:08.198 --> 07:11.895
And she had her little cane
pole, what she called it.

07:11.895 --> 07:13.995
She went around a bush and it was squatted

07:13.995 --> 07:16.371
down next to the water.

07:16.371 --> 07:18.056
It was washing it's feet off.

07:18.056 --> 07:20.435
It stood up and she stood face to face

07:20.435 --> 07:22.068
with it within five feet.

07:22.068 --> 07:23.145
She went back and got in the wagon

07:23.145 --> 07:26.152
and she never came back to this area.

07:26.152 --> 07:28.770
- Prior to me ever becoming

07:28.770 --> 07:30.638
a deputy sheriff,

07:30.638 --> 07:33.651
I was hunting one night,
we used to fox hunt.

07:33.651 --> 07:35.132
I was hunting with my father in law

07:35.132 --> 07:37.078
and he relayed a story to me that

07:37.078 --> 07:41.092
they were hunting and all of
a sudden the dogs shut down.

07:41.092 --> 07:43.612
The dogs quit barking, they came to them

07:43.612 --> 07:47.020
who was in the draw between two ridges.

07:47.020 --> 07:48.915
And they couldn't
understand what the problem

07:48.915 --> 07:51.565
might have been but eventually there was

07:51.565 --> 07:54.519
a great big hairy looking monster.

07:54.519 --> 07:55.503
As he referred to it.

07:55.503 --> 07:56.968
A man or whatever.

07:56.968 --> 07:57.990
They didn't give it a name

07:57.990 --> 07:59.625
'cause they didn't know what it was.

07:59.625 --> 08:01.137
Merged out of the woods.

08:01.137 --> 08:03.182
And stood there looking in their area

08:03.182 --> 08:06.079
which they was at the bottom of the draw.

08:06.079 --> 08:08.577
And they had a small weapon with them

08:08.577 --> 08:12.362
and they fired it several
times at the monster.

08:12.362 --> 08:15.614
But into the air hoping to
frighten it but it didn't.

08:15.614 --> 08:17.924
It stood there and walked,
turned around, looked.

08:17.924 --> 08:19.450
Looked like it was looking down at them

08:19.450 --> 08:21.714
and they did not want to leave their area

08:21.714 --> 08:24.752
by themselves on the ridge.

08:24.752 --> 08:26.343
And so they stayed there
for quite some time

08:26.343 --> 08:28.155
they finally went home.

08:28.155 --> 08:29.840
This was prior to me ever becoming

08:29.840 --> 08:31.284
a law enforcement officer.

08:31.284 --> 08:33.674
And the date and time that
it happened I don't know.

08:33.674 --> 08:36.020
The story was told to me probably about

08:36.020 --> 08:38.270
1966, 67, that time period.

08:39.357 --> 08:42.647
So it already happened
some period earlier.

08:42.647 --> 08:44.902
- I graduated in 64 so that's when our

08:44.902 --> 08:48.029
seniors had encountered some
barefooted man on Boggy Creek.

08:48.029 --> 08:51.526
They had two packs of coon
dogs, they'd mix packs.

08:51.526 --> 08:53.746
And on a given night, as
they called or we called

08:53.746 --> 08:55.194
the barefooted man.

08:55.194 --> 08:57.587
'Cause that was the tracks they found.

08:57.587 --> 08:58.990
He killed all the dogs.

08:58.990 --> 09:00.189
And they come school the next day

09:00.189 --> 09:02.357
trying to get a vigilante thing going

09:02.357 --> 09:06.530
to go in there and hunt this
man down on Boggy Creek.

09:06.530 --> 09:08.499
Some of the seniors went,

09:08.499 --> 09:10.192
a couple of us didn't get to go.

09:10.192 --> 09:12.419
We tried but our parents wouldn't let us.

09:12.419 --> 09:15.457
And they never came back with proof

09:15.457 --> 09:17.426
as to who it was or what.

09:17.426 --> 09:21.593
That was our monster dust
as we look back, hindsight.

09:22.971 --> 09:25.502
- [Lyle] On a warm May evening in 1971,

09:25.502 --> 09:27.894
the Boggy Creek monster
took it's first steps

09:27.894 --> 09:29.997
into the public eye.

09:29.997 --> 09:31.642
Those sightings of the creature had been

09:31.642 --> 09:33.618
taking place years before the event

09:33.618 --> 09:35.438
that was about to transpire.

09:35.438 --> 09:39.160
This proved to be the tipping point.

09:39.160 --> 09:41.916
Just after sunset on Saturday May 1st

09:41.916 --> 09:45.178
at a small frame house off of Highway 71

09:45.178 --> 09:46.743
the Ford and Turner families

09:46.743 --> 09:48.631
were just settling in for the night

09:48.631 --> 09:51.114
when they had an experience
that would haunt them

09:51.114 --> 09:53.876
for the rest of their lives.

09:53.876 --> 09:55.851
Elizabeth Ford made the first contact

09:55.851 --> 09:58.061
when she was torn from her peaceful sleep

09:58.061 --> 09:59.997
by a massive hairy hand reaching

09:59.997 --> 10:02.253
through a nearby window.

10:02.253 --> 10:04.014
Behind the hand peering at her

10:04.014 --> 10:06.560
were two red eyes that she said,

10:06.560 --> 10:08.893
"Looked like coals of fire."

10:10.324 --> 10:11.917
The men of the house rushed outside

10:11.917 --> 10:13.894
to meet the thing head on.

10:13.894 --> 10:15.943
Armed with a shotgun and a flashlight

10:15.943 --> 10:18.525
they spotted the creature
and starting shooting.

10:18.525 --> 10:21.508
It fled into the nearby woods.

10:21.508 --> 10:23.478
The family quickly
retreated into the house

10:23.478 --> 10:25.287
where they called the local police.

10:25.287 --> 10:28.336
Headed by Constable Ernest Walraven.

10:28.336 --> 10:31.396
Walraven and a young
deputy named H.L. Phillips

10:31.396 --> 10:35.054
arrived at the Ford house
and found the family shaken.

10:35.054 --> 10:37.384
But they found no
creature on the property.

10:37.384 --> 10:40.154
So they took their leave.

10:40.154 --> 10:41.801
- I know that I arrived there

10:41.801 --> 10:45.514
and Red Walraven who was
the Cosnstable of Fouke

10:45.514 --> 10:49.758
at that time, we both arrived
at about the same time.

10:49.758 --> 10:53.688
It was uncontrollable type of a situation.

10:53.688 --> 10:55.238
There was total panic among the members,

10:55.238 --> 10:57.223
which was several people living there

10:57.223 --> 10:59.209
in the house at that time.

10:59.209 --> 11:00.525
- [Lyle] A short time later the monster

11:00.525 --> 11:02.330
returned to the scene and was greeted

11:02.330 --> 11:06.310
yet again with gunfire
from the terrified family.

11:06.310 --> 11:08.737
While no blood or other
evidence could be found,

11:08.737 --> 11:11.608
the men were insistent
they'd struck the creature

11:11.608 --> 11:13.870
and they had seen it fall.

11:13.870 --> 11:16.512
The incident proceeded to
unfold with more sightings

11:16.512 --> 11:18.686
and a scene that proved terrifying

11:18.686 --> 11:20.196
for audiences when it appeared

11:20.196 --> 11:22.959
in The Legend of Boggy Creek a year later.

11:22.959 --> 11:24.399
Wherein the creature attacked

11:24.399 --> 11:27.174
the youngest of the family, Bobby Ford.

11:27.174 --> 11:29.030
As in real life, the incident resulted

11:29.030 --> 11:31.394
in Ford being taken to a local hospital

11:31.394 --> 11:35.915
where he was treated for
injuries and mild shock.

11:35.915 --> 11:38.982
- They said that Bobby Ford

11:38.982 --> 11:41.529
was definitely involved in some,

11:41.529 --> 11:44.779
something had actually happened to him.

11:46.428 --> 11:47.830
He had wet his britches

11:47.830 --> 11:49.605
or something had happened there

11:49.605 --> 11:52.730
that would cause this get to hurt.

11:52.730 --> 11:55.104
But that he was in a state of,

11:55.104 --> 11:57.192
you know, like shock.

11:57.192 --> 11:58.717
- [Lyle] The Ford incident was documented

11:58.717 --> 12:01.526
by the Texarkana Gazette
in a series of articles

12:01.526 --> 12:04.687
that meticulously retold the encounter.

12:04.687 --> 12:06.222
Much to the Ford's chagrin,

12:06.222 --> 12:08.817
they became the subject
of mockery and ridicule

12:08.817 --> 12:12.817
as the local monster story
was shot down by skeptics.

12:12.817 --> 12:14.226
To make matters worse,

12:14.226 --> 12:15.956
monster hunters turned the Ford home

12:15.956 --> 12:18.012
into a tourist attraction as they searched

12:18.012 --> 12:20.880
the property for signs of the monster.

12:20.880 --> 12:22.402
- And we could look at the area

12:22.402 --> 12:24.615
and see that the area was
disturbed, was tore up.

12:24.615 --> 12:27.419
And it was not something
that was prefabricated

12:27.419 --> 12:29.868
because of the way that they was disturbed

12:29.868 --> 12:32.701
and actually being a lot of people

12:34.099 --> 12:37.593
I could tell that they
themselves were not actors.

12:37.593 --> 12:39.989
That something truly happened there.

12:39.989 --> 12:42.003
And this was the beginning of the

12:42.003 --> 12:45.326
so called Fouke monster in this area.

12:45.326 --> 12:47.187
- [Lyle] As for the Ford's themselves,

12:47.187 --> 12:50.020
they quickly packed up
their things and left Fouke.

12:50.020 --> 12:51.353
Never to return.

12:52.430 --> 12:55.287
(bird chirping)

12:55.287 --> 12:57.620
(loud roar)

13:03.853 --> 13:07.103
(high pitch screaming)

13:09.037 --> 13:09.908
- Shoot him!

13:09.908 --> 13:12.720
(loud gunfire)

13:12.720 --> 13:15.637
(glass shattering)

13:16.712 --> 13:18.294
Fouke was abuzz with the latest news

13:18.294 --> 13:20.115
of the Boggy Creek monster.

13:20.115 --> 13:22.378
Sightings ranged across Miller County

13:22.378 --> 13:24.353
with a number of them
occurring in locations

13:24.353 --> 13:27.579
such as Highway 71, the
Sulphur River Bottoms,

13:27.579 --> 13:29.794
the nearby community of Jonesville,

13:29.794 --> 13:32.760
and along Boggy Creek itself.

13:32.760 --> 13:34.361
Locals and out of towners alike

13:34.361 --> 13:36.617
formed posse's to search for the creature.

13:36.617 --> 13:38.726
Hoping to bring home the head of a monster

13:38.726 --> 13:40.899
to mount on their wall.

13:40.899 --> 13:42.889
As the scene in and around Miller County

13:42.889 --> 13:45.524
turned more chaotic with each passing day,

13:45.524 --> 13:48.507
media coverage of the
Fouke monster increased.

13:48.507 --> 13:51.057
Charles B. Pierce, an
up and coming filmmaker

13:51.057 --> 13:52.867
with an eye out for a good story,

13:52.867 --> 13:54.640
decided the Boggy Creek monster

13:54.640 --> 13:58.793
would be the perfect subject
for his first feature film.

13:58.793 --> 14:01.222
After borrowing money
from a local business man,

14:01.222 --> 14:03.651
he gathered a small
crew and headed to Fouke

14:03.651 --> 14:05.627
to make his movie.

14:05.627 --> 14:08.094
Though it was originally
intended to be a documentary

14:08.094 --> 14:10.612
the film turned out to
be something audiences

14:10.612 --> 14:13.609
had never experienced before.

14:13.609 --> 14:15.999
Equal parts documentary, horror movie,

14:15.999 --> 14:18.387
and nature film, The Legend of Boggy Creek

14:18.387 --> 14:21.348
dramatized the story of
the monster sightings.

14:21.348 --> 14:23.157
It featured non actors,

14:23.157 --> 14:24.802
many of whom played themselves

14:24.802 --> 14:28.969
reenacting their actual
encounters with the beast.

14:29.984 --> 14:34.439
Locals, such as the
Searcy's And the Crabtree's

14:34.439 --> 14:36.815
shared screen time with the creature

14:36.815 --> 14:39.534
that had stalked their family just years

14:39.534 --> 14:41.342
and even months earlier.

14:41.342 --> 14:42.600
- Of course I grew up with it before that.

14:42.600 --> 14:46.467
My family's Crabtree's so you heard a lot

14:46.467 --> 14:49.141
of stories back long
before the actual movie

14:49.141 --> 14:50.708
of The Legend of Boggy Creek came out.

14:50.708 --> 14:52.848
So when my dad would take me to the woods

14:52.848 --> 14:54.948
and put me by a tree,

14:54.948 --> 14:58.054
you prayed for daylight, you really did.

14:58.054 --> 14:59.662
It was quite startling to be out there

14:59.662 --> 15:01.842
by yourself during that time period.

15:01.842 --> 15:03.318
- [Lyle] Made on a shoestring budget

15:03.318 --> 15:05.377
and released entirely independent of major

15:05.377 --> 15:07.854
studio involvement, the
movie was an instant

15:07.854 --> 15:10.857
success in the local region.

15:10.857 --> 15:13.496
Eventually the film secured
theatrical distribution

15:13.496 --> 15:16.679
and went on to play across the country.

15:16.679 --> 15:19.860
It enjoyed a particularly
successful run at drive-ins.

15:19.860 --> 15:21.516
Where it was often paired with other

15:21.516 --> 15:22.702
creature features.

15:22.702 --> 15:24.959
Including those that
focused on a burgeoning

15:24.959 --> 15:27.792
pop culture icon known as Bigfoot.

15:30.168 --> 15:32.413
By the end of the 1970's the film

15:32.413 --> 15:35.624
had earned an estimated
25 million dollars.

15:35.624 --> 15:38.388
An amazing feat for an
independent production

15:38.388 --> 15:40.484
and a first time director.

15:40.484 --> 15:41.862
- They were kind of excited.

15:41.862 --> 15:43.268
It was something different.

15:43.268 --> 15:45.020
The movie came out, we all loaded up

15:45.020 --> 15:47.276
in the back end of a 72 Vega

15:47.276 --> 15:48.795
and we went and watched the movie.

15:48.795 --> 15:50.304
Back then it was a lot of excitement.

15:50.304 --> 15:51.866
The movie had just come out,

15:51.866 --> 15:53.351
it was fresh in everybody's mind.

15:53.351 --> 15:54.992
The sightings up and down 71 Highway

15:54.992 --> 15:58.912
between Texarkana and
Shreveport was almost every day.

15:58.912 --> 16:00.463
Somebody saw something.

16:00.463 --> 16:03.162
And if they didn't see anything
they think they made it up.

16:03.162 --> 16:05.688
- I remember going to the movie myself

16:05.688 --> 16:07.704
and the thing that impressed me was

16:07.704 --> 16:10.533
as I drove up to the movie theater,

16:10.533 --> 16:12.717
there was already a line people

16:12.717 --> 16:15.678
strung all the way around the block.

16:15.678 --> 16:18.777
And I got there 40
minutes before it started.

16:18.777 --> 16:20.139
- [Lyle] Back in Fouke however,

16:20.139 --> 16:23.146
the movie received a mixed
reaction by the towns folk.

16:23.146 --> 16:26.082
What was once a peaceful
out of the way place

16:26.082 --> 16:28.724
was now the scene of a chaotic frenzy.

16:28.724 --> 16:30.735
The movie success brought in waves

16:30.735 --> 16:33.276
of curiosity seekers and monster hunters

16:33.276 --> 16:35.820
who trampled the local countryside.

16:35.820 --> 16:38.190
While some locals
benefited by the tourism,

16:38.190 --> 16:40.648
it was a headache to others.

16:40.648 --> 16:42.534
In one of The Legend of Boggy Creek's

16:42.534 --> 16:45.525
most iconic scenes, the
Searcy home is besieged

16:45.525 --> 16:48.963
by the Fouke the monster over
the course of one evening.

16:48.963 --> 16:50.927
It's an incident I've been fascinated with

16:50.927 --> 16:52.944
since first viewing the film.

16:52.944 --> 16:55.294
But what became of the Searcy's?

16:55.294 --> 16:57.636
Like many of the witnesses featured

16:57.636 --> 16:58.869
in The Legend of Boggy Creek,

16:58.869 --> 17:00.675
the family was subject to ridicule.

17:00.675 --> 17:02.689
And for decades they were
constantly questioned

17:02.689 --> 17:04.810
about their claims.

17:04.810 --> 17:06.749
Of the many witnesses I've spoken to,

17:06.749 --> 17:08.771
the majority are more than a little leery

17:08.771 --> 17:12.146
of speaking publicly
about their experiences.

17:12.146 --> 17:13.289
Mary Beth Searcy,

17:13.289 --> 17:16.582
the family's prime
witness was no different.

17:16.582 --> 17:19.164
As well, many of the
actors featured in the film

17:19.164 --> 17:21.137
were local citizens who had not received

17:21.137 --> 17:23.570
a share of it's bountiful box office.

17:23.570 --> 17:27.117
While the value of such
notoriety was debatable,

17:27.117 --> 17:28.972
it was certain the tiny town

17:28.972 --> 17:31.154
would never be the same.

17:31.154 --> 17:33.654
- People came from all around.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.052
You go down the road there's somebody

17:36.052 --> 17:38.149
standing on the road with a gun

17:38.149 --> 17:40.727
wanting to kill the Fouke monster.

17:40.727 --> 17:44.001
And we still continue to get
these calls, these reports,

17:44.001 --> 17:48.347
but each time we did it
caused a lot of problems.

17:48.347 --> 17:51.022
The problem was actually
the citizen around Fouke,

17:51.022 --> 17:53.369
they go out and look across the field

17:53.369 --> 17:54.810
and there's a bunch of people out there

17:54.810 --> 17:55.716
with guns and stuff.

17:55.716 --> 17:58.298
And so we try to keep as quiet as possible

17:58.298 --> 18:00.405
after this event occurred.

18:00.405 --> 18:01.810
- When the movie came out,

18:01.810 --> 18:03.293
the best way to put it is

18:03.293 --> 18:07.458
it revolutionized the culture
of the city and the area.

18:07.458 --> 18:08.901
- When they made the movie,

18:08.901 --> 18:11.249
half the people shunned it and
half the people embraced it.

18:11.249 --> 18:13.018
So you had a split reaction on

18:13.018 --> 18:16.100
what was actually gonna transpire
while they were making it.

18:16.100 --> 18:17.923
So you had a line of
people ready to be on it.

18:17.923 --> 18:20.320
You had another line of people
ready to walk out the door.

18:20.320 --> 18:21.511
The ones that they did interview

18:21.511 --> 18:24.900
that I saw on the movie, I know in person,

18:24.900 --> 18:27.164
they're credible, they
don't just make stuff up

18:27.164 --> 18:28.478
to be making stuff up.

18:28.478 --> 18:31.033
And if they told ya a
story it's what it was.

18:31.033 --> 18:32.186
They just weren't out there to try

18:32.186 --> 18:34.781
to make a buck off a movie.

18:34.781 --> 18:38.523
- The movie had a response
from all over the US.

18:38.523 --> 18:40.167
From all over the US.

18:40.167 --> 18:43.263
And a lot of people after seeing the movie

18:43.263 --> 18:46.200
wanted answers because they themselves

18:46.200 --> 18:48.866
had experienced something like that.

18:48.866 --> 18:49.699
Something weird.

18:49.699 --> 18:53.866
But it was a wide, they came
from all over the states.

18:55.461 --> 18:56.696
- [Lyle] The Boggy Creek Monster

18:56.696 --> 18:57.678
seems to be a phantom.

18:57.678 --> 19:00.697
Rarely leaving behind
any physical evidence.

19:00.697 --> 19:02.530
But on June 13th 1971,

19:04.259 --> 19:05.759
that would change.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.683
Tracks were found in a local bean field

19:08.683 --> 19:10.332
owned by Willy Smith.

19:10.332 --> 19:12.185
They were unlike any the town folk

19:12.185 --> 19:15.318
had ever seen before or since.

19:15.318 --> 19:17.972
Possessing what appeared
to be just three toes,

19:17.972 --> 19:20.988
the tracks followed a path
out of the bordering forest

19:20.988 --> 19:25.114
across the field, and then
back into the wood line.

19:25.114 --> 19:26.756
I noted the proximity of the field

19:26.756 --> 19:28.904
to the famed Boggy Creek itself

19:28.904 --> 19:33.518
when I visited the location
during one of my research trips.

19:33.518 --> 19:36.505
While the strange tracks do
raise a number of questions,

19:36.505 --> 19:38.849
they were discovered
at just the right time.

19:38.849 --> 19:42.020
Allowing them to become a
feature of Pierce's movie.

19:42.020 --> 19:45.177
But what kind of huge bipedal creature

19:45.177 --> 19:49.229
can carry itself on such
a narrow, three toed foot?

19:49.229 --> 19:51.323
- Actually it was my uncle's field.

19:51.323 --> 19:53.210
It was down there where the
first tracks were found.

19:53.210 --> 19:54.521
It kind of stirred all this up.

19:54.521 --> 19:56.483
(mumbling)

19:56.483 --> 19:57.733
My great uncle.

19:58.633 --> 20:02.988
And I used to pick cotton
on that same bean field.

20:02.988 --> 20:05.124
- I lifted several
tracks out of bean field.

20:05.124 --> 20:07.670
I recall it seems to me probably

20:07.670 --> 20:10.264
about 13 inches three toes.

20:10.264 --> 20:13.670
But I lifted a lot of plastic
casts out of that field.

20:13.670 --> 20:16.505
- My uncle lived down here.

20:16.505 --> 20:18.687
He called my mother.

20:18.687 --> 20:20.899
They got her to bring a
bag of her plaster paris

20:20.899 --> 20:25.860
down to the Smith farm and
mold three of the tracks.

20:25.860 --> 20:28.443
- And what may wreck this a bit

20:30.057 --> 20:31.341
different from the normal thing

20:31.341 --> 20:34.372
is the strides were so far apart.

20:34.372 --> 20:37.318
- And to our knowledge, it's
the only existing print,

20:37.318 --> 20:40.607
the only existing cast
of that year and time.

20:40.607 --> 20:43.556
It had a measure roughly 14 inches.

20:43.556 --> 20:48.224
But the foot does a concave
thing in the dirt, in the sand.

20:48.224 --> 20:52.375
You can see the claws, his
toenails and the area on it.

20:52.375 --> 20:54.877
It still has particles from that time

20:54.877 --> 20:56.770
caught up in the plaster.

20:56.770 --> 20:58.656
- The tracks went from the road

20:58.656 --> 20:59.729
to the other side of the road.

20:59.729 --> 21:02.008
I recall it was too much debris.

21:02.008 --> 21:04.925
Only thing about this was a plowed field.

21:04.925 --> 21:06.727
It went for a short distance

21:06.727 --> 21:10.802
until it went back into
another brushy area.

21:10.802 --> 21:15.510
But from that period over there
was several tracks embedded.

21:15.510 --> 21:17.480
- Part of the evidence
you can't overlook it.

21:17.480 --> 21:19.322
People seeing things, whether they got

21:19.322 --> 21:22.444
physical evidence to show or not.

21:22.444 --> 21:25.198
It convinced me there's more to it

21:25.198 --> 21:26.448
than just talk.

21:28.082 --> 21:31.626
The legend, there's
more than just a legend.

21:31.626 --> 21:33.593
- [Lyle] The footprints
offered a compelling

21:33.593 --> 21:35.915
bit of evidence for the
Boggy Creek monster,

21:35.915 --> 21:37.671
but not proof.

21:37.671 --> 21:39.136
Skeptics were quick to point out

21:39.136 --> 21:42.177
the implausibility of the bizarre tracks.

21:42.177 --> 21:44.233
Still, sightings of the creature

21:44.233 --> 21:46.900
persisted well beyond the movie.

21:48.378 --> 21:49.974
It was the history of the movie

21:49.974 --> 21:51.209
and the search for the truth

21:51.209 --> 21:53.342
that first brought me to Fouke.

21:53.342 --> 21:57.447
It was a place that had such
a huge inspiration on my life.

21:57.447 --> 21:59.807
But what I found was that the sightings

21:59.807 --> 22:03.138
of the creature had not
stopped in the early 1970's

22:03.138 --> 22:05.199
as many came to believe.

22:05.199 --> 22:09.405
People did in fact continue
to see the alleged creature.

22:09.405 --> 22:11.911
One of those people is Will Lunsford.

22:11.911 --> 22:13.390
A boy who had encountered the beast

22:13.390 --> 22:15.913
in the late 1970's and whose life

22:15.913 --> 22:19.014
has been immeasurably change by it.

22:19.014 --> 22:21.228
- What year was that?

22:21.228 --> 22:25.422
- This was 1977 and I was
a senior in high school.

22:25.422 --> 22:27.606
As I said, I didn't expect this day

22:27.606 --> 22:29.218
to be any different than any other day

22:29.218 --> 22:31.292
I'd ever spent down here in my life.

22:31.292 --> 22:32.764
- [Lyle] Speaking with people like Will

22:32.764 --> 22:34.816
is a constant reminder of just how much

22:34.816 --> 22:38.643
the creature can impact
the life of a witness.

22:38.643 --> 22:40.834
For some the encounter becomes a force

22:40.834 --> 22:43.396
that haunts them their whole life.

22:43.396 --> 22:45.215
For Will, it's the driving force

22:45.215 --> 22:47.527
that compels him to
search for the creature

22:47.527 --> 22:50.565
long after he first saw it.

22:50.565 --> 22:52.170
- And the Fouke monster here

22:52.170 --> 22:55.355
and I was not a believer in the creature.

22:55.355 --> 22:56.938
And so like I said,

22:57.957 --> 23:00.845
I didn't expect anything to happen.

23:00.845 --> 23:03.557
- Had you seen the movie prior to this?

23:03.557 --> 23:04.796
- I had seen the movie probably back in

23:04.796 --> 23:08.176
probably 72 or 73 when it came out.

23:08.176 --> 23:11.821
- So that day when you had the encounter,

23:11.821 --> 23:13.344
what were you doing?

23:13.344 --> 23:14.901
Walk me through that.

23:14.901 --> 23:17.084
- [Will] Okay I was down there fishing.

23:17.084 --> 23:20.185
And about the same time it
is right here right now.

23:20.185 --> 23:22.366
And the sun was starting
to set a little bit.

23:22.366 --> 23:23.775
I had a few more pits that I was

23:23.775 --> 23:25.385
wanting to fish and get to.

23:25.385 --> 23:28.273
So as we did that there we
kinda stepped up a little bit

23:28.273 --> 23:30.564
and I came to a crossing of this gas line.

23:30.564 --> 23:34.126
And as I went to cross, I'd
been smelling this nasty smell.

23:34.126 --> 23:35.924
And I thought, "Well that's roadkill."

23:35.924 --> 23:37.183
Because there's always fish.

23:37.183 --> 23:39.201
There's things that be coming
out of the gravel pits.

23:39.201 --> 23:40.099
Animals that have been eaten.

23:40.099 --> 23:42.796
So I didn't think anything about it.

23:42.796 --> 23:46.688
So as I went to cross
the gas line up there

23:46.688 --> 23:48.044
there was something that
just didn't look right.

23:48.044 --> 23:51.097
And I had walked this place
thousands of times before.

23:51.097 --> 23:53.986
And so I kept looking, I'm
like, "Something is not right.

23:53.986 --> 23:55.098
"Something is not right."

23:55.098 --> 23:56.721
Well finally I guess I had sit there

23:56.721 --> 23:58.286
and stared at this thing long enough.

23:58.286 --> 24:00.474
He stepped off the road

24:00.474 --> 24:03.858
into a shadow so to speak
right there behind the tree.

24:03.858 --> 24:06.358
And all of a sudden he's down,

24:07.565 --> 24:10.374
and then all of a sudden he
lifts this bush above his head

24:10.374 --> 24:12.627
and he starts standing up.

24:12.627 --> 24:14.735
And he keeps standing up,
and he keeps standing up

24:14.735 --> 24:16.498
and I thought, bear.

24:16.498 --> 24:18.503
First thing I thought.

24:18.503 --> 24:21.687
Which would have been
frightening in itself.

24:21.687 --> 24:23.167
But then whenever he sit there and I got

24:23.167 --> 24:26.582
a good look at the face I
realized that's not a bear.

24:26.582 --> 24:27.793
And he sit there and looked at me

24:27.793 --> 24:28.756
and I couldn't move.

24:28.756 --> 24:30.751
I wanted to run, I just couldn't run.

24:30.751 --> 24:33.167
And so I sit there and he walks

24:33.167 --> 24:35.138
out in the middle of the trail.

24:35.138 --> 24:36.526
Right here where I'm fishing,

24:36.526 --> 24:37.916
and he just sit there.

24:37.916 --> 24:40.668
And he just stares at me
and he kind of teeters.

24:40.668 --> 24:42.185
Like this right here.

24:42.185 --> 24:44.977
And man I'm just, I can already

24:44.977 --> 24:47.396
feel tears coming down my face.

24:47.396 --> 24:51.122
And so as he stands there
maybe 30 to 40 seconds,

24:51.122 --> 24:53.452
he walks back to the tree.

24:53.452 --> 24:55.517
He pulls the same limb down.

24:55.517 --> 24:56.969
He does what I call skin the cat.

24:56.969 --> 24:58.636
Puts it in his lips, does that.

24:58.636 --> 25:00.241
He walks back out in front of the trail

25:00.241 --> 25:01.840
again there in front of
me and he stands there

25:01.840 --> 25:03.332
and teeters like don't come down here.

25:03.332 --> 25:05.364
This is still my territory.

25:05.364 --> 25:07.901
He sits there maybe
another 20 to 30 seconds.

25:07.901 --> 25:10.457
And man he just whips
and goes into the woods.

25:10.457 --> 25:12.355
And in two steps you don't see him

25:12.355 --> 25:14.772
and in three steps he's gone.

25:16.391 --> 25:17.924
- [Lyle] Will Lunsford's sighting location

25:17.924 --> 25:19.415
is in the heart of what seems to be

25:19.415 --> 25:21.515
the creatures domain.

25:21.515 --> 25:23.778
While there are sightings
along Boggy Creek,

25:23.778 --> 25:25.748
closer to downtown Fouke,

25:25.748 --> 25:29.242
the bulk of them take place
further from civilization.

25:29.242 --> 25:32.289
As development continues
to overtake the land,

25:32.289 --> 25:34.512
it's easy to theorize
that perhaps the creature

25:34.512 --> 25:38.679
is retreating into the
uninhabitable areas outside of town.

25:40.243 --> 25:42.156
Just a few miles west of Fouke lies

25:42.156 --> 25:43.993
the Sulphur River Bottoms.

25:43.993 --> 25:46.207
A vast flood plain that derives it's name

25:46.207 --> 25:48.339
from the Sulphur River.

25:48.339 --> 25:50.811
Encounters there have a
long lingering history

25:50.811 --> 25:52.456
that seems to have been dredged up

25:52.456 --> 25:54.747
from the swamps themselves.

25:54.747 --> 25:56.634
For nearly two centuries stories have

25:56.634 --> 25:59.131
been coming out of
places like Mercer Bayou,

25:59.131 --> 26:01.462
Carter Lake, and Gifford Hills.

26:01.462 --> 26:03.262
Over the years as my research into the

26:03.262 --> 26:05.353
Boggy Creek case continued,

26:05.353 --> 26:07.750
I found myself constantly pulled back

26:07.750 --> 26:09.440
to these locations.

26:09.440 --> 26:13.110
These are the wild places
of southern Arkansas.

26:13.110 --> 26:16.409
Acres and acres of
untamed, overgrown lands

26:16.409 --> 26:20.492
flooded by the black murky
waters of the bayou's.

26:21.754 --> 26:23.325
- Of course now that the bottoms here

26:23.325 --> 26:26.007
run Mercy Bayou and Sulphur bottoms

26:26.007 --> 26:27.936
that remains pretty much the same

26:27.936 --> 26:29.457
as it's always been.

26:29.457 --> 26:32.507
'Cause it's just uninhabitable.

26:32.507 --> 26:34.439
There's a lot of land

26:34.439 --> 26:36.840
no ones ever set foot
on I'm sure about that.

26:36.840 --> 26:38.908
- This area around here in Fouke,

26:38.908 --> 26:40.346
an abundance of animals.

26:40.346 --> 26:43.850
Any big predator would
just have a field day here.

26:43.850 --> 26:46.020
I mean hogs are easy.

26:46.020 --> 26:47.925
They're there for the taking I think.

26:47.925 --> 26:50.520
And you're seeing more and more signs

26:50.520 --> 26:52.939
of dead animals in the woods, bones.

26:52.939 --> 26:55.065
You know that it takes a large predator

26:55.065 --> 26:57.817
to take down such a size of an animal.

26:57.817 --> 26:59.291
- [Lyle] The bottom lands are fed

26:59.291 --> 27:00.851
by numerous waterways and of these

27:00.851 --> 27:04.049
none is more infamous
than Boggy Creek itself.

27:04.049 --> 27:05.724
But for all it's notoriety,

27:05.724 --> 27:08.919
Boggy Creek is a little
more than a small tributary

27:08.919 --> 27:11.752
that snakes through Miller County.

27:12.981 --> 27:14.755
This may seem underwhelming given

27:14.755 --> 27:17.229
it's historic prominence in a famous film.

27:17.229 --> 27:19.078
However, tracking the sheer number

27:19.078 --> 27:21.674
of sightings that take
place along the waterway

27:21.674 --> 27:23.424
makes it significant.

27:24.845 --> 27:27.056
The creek meanders west of Fouke under

27:27.056 --> 27:29.153
major roadways, through farms,

27:29.153 --> 27:30.974
fields, and dense forests,

27:30.974 --> 27:34.141
and eventually spills into Days Creek.

27:35.955 --> 27:39.012
So did the film make Boggy
Creek part of the legend?

27:39.012 --> 27:44.007
Or did it's legendary status
date back even further?

27:44.007 --> 27:46.075
I came to find out that Willy Smith,

27:46.075 --> 27:48.556
the same Willy Smith
who owned the bean field

27:48.556 --> 27:50.042
where the tracks were found

27:50.042 --> 27:53.049
told a reporter for the
Victoria Advocate newspaper

27:53.049 --> 27:54.524
that his sister had encountered

27:54.524 --> 27:56.444
the creature near Boggy Creek.

27:56.444 --> 27:58.111
As far back as 1908.

28:00.309 --> 28:03.472
In 1955 Smith claimed that he himself

28:03.472 --> 28:05.891
had been haunted by the
creature near his house.

28:05.891 --> 28:10.058
Which not surprisingly, was
situated along Boggy Creek.

28:11.469 --> 28:13.956
- Days Creek and Boggy Creek have remained

28:13.956 --> 28:15.803
pretty well the same.

28:15.803 --> 28:18.859
And it is a creek where
there are a lot of snakes,

28:18.859 --> 28:21.109
turtles, beaver, fish, gar,

28:22.233 --> 28:25.791
all kinds of wildlife of that nature.

28:25.791 --> 28:27.843
- The stories coming out of Mercer Bayou

28:27.843 --> 28:30.398
and along Boggy Creek are a lot more

28:30.398 --> 28:33.245
believable when you sit and listen to 'em.

28:33.245 --> 28:36.662
- Most of it was in the Boggy Creek area.

28:37.526 --> 28:40.766
The secluded part of Miller county.

28:40.766 --> 28:43.710
We had one couple that was fishing on

28:43.710 --> 28:46.366
Sulphur River and heard something

28:46.366 --> 28:48.449
coming through the woods.

28:49.318 --> 28:52.603
And saw it go down into the briars

28:52.603 --> 28:56.208
and debris and stuff that
had gone up on the bank.

28:56.208 --> 28:57.718
We saw it go down in there

28:57.718 --> 29:00.982
they come out and actually just disappear.

29:00.982 --> 29:02.630
They said when they
saw it they immediately

29:02.630 --> 29:05.861
turned and started going back up.

29:05.861 --> 29:07.018
But they described it as

29:07.018 --> 29:10.018
a great big monster, as they put it.

29:11.695 --> 29:13.536
Just on the little (talks too fast).

29:13.536 --> 29:15.018
Now these are, you know,

29:15.018 --> 29:16.207
just two people fishing.

29:16.207 --> 29:18.790
- It was November the 2nd 2011.

29:20.543 --> 29:23.100
And I was down here at Thornton Wells.

29:23.100 --> 29:25.728
And I forgot my game
camera down at the bayou.

29:25.728 --> 29:27.840
We had a big storm that night.

29:27.840 --> 29:28.988
So my wife calls me and says

29:28.988 --> 29:31.971
"You need to go get your
camera out of the bayou."

29:31.971 --> 29:34.194
So I come down to the
bayou to get my camera.

29:34.194 --> 29:36.009
I was on my way to military duty,

29:36.009 --> 29:39.522
so I was still in my ACU's, my Army stuff.

29:39.522 --> 29:41.618
I come down here and get out of the truck,

29:41.618 --> 29:43.820
walk about 60 yards and something

29:43.820 --> 29:46.965
had gotten between, or was already here,

29:46.965 --> 29:48.411
between me and my truck.

29:48.411 --> 29:51.960
And I got a knock, it knocked three times.

29:51.960 --> 29:53.977
It was in sequence.

29:53.977 --> 29:55.394
Nothing sporadic.

29:56.526 --> 29:58.696
It was kinda freaky.

29:58.696 --> 29:59.767
- [Lyle] The Legend of Boggy Creek

29:59.767 --> 30:01.758
may not have passed into legend at all

30:01.758 --> 30:04.298
if not for the Crabtree's.

30:04.298 --> 30:06.378
As a kid I was well aware of the name

30:06.378 --> 30:08.885
thanks to the movie and
it's musical interlude

30:08.885 --> 30:11.552
which sings hey Travis Crabtree.

30:12.951 --> 30:15.093
The Crabtree family
had been local to Fouke

30:15.093 --> 30:17.021
for over a century now.

30:17.021 --> 30:19.313
They lived and worked
in the same wild land

30:19.313 --> 30:23.366
that some speculate the Boggy
Creek monster calls home.

30:23.366 --> 30:26.395
Ad far back as the mid 1950's,

30:26.395 --> 30:28.321
members of the family claim to have had

30:28.321 --> 30:30.418
sightings of the beast.

30:30.418 --> 30:32.396
None of the Crabtree's were more tied

30:32.396 --> 30:36.066
to the Fouke monster than Smokey Crabtree.

30:36.066 --> 30:39.208
- [Smokey] I was born on
the banks of Sulphur River.

30:39.208 --> 30:42.622
Seven miles from a
little town called Fouke.

30:42.622 --> 30:46.256
They was seven children in the family.

30:46.256 --> 30:49.423
My dad died when I was five years old.

30:50.763 --> 30:53.318
Left mother with seven children

30:53.318 --> 30:57.016
to raise there on the bank
of the river in the woods.

30:57.016 --> 30:59.913
Seven miles from the
closest grocery store.

30:59.913 --> 31:03.830
But we growed up in the
woods with the animals.

31:05.219 --> 31:09.502
Now the creature that we've all been after

31:09.502 --> 31:11.366
for 30 or 40 years.

31:11.366 --> 31:13.594
Some people called it the Bigfoot.

31:13.594 --> 31:15.931
Some of 'em call it the Fouke monster.

31:15.931 --> 31:18.097
Some of 'em call it the creature.

31:18.097 --> 31:20.070
But it'll take a long time

31:20.070 --> 31:23.058
for 'em to ever outdo an animal.

31:23.058 --> 31:24.869
- I grew up with the Crabtree boys.

31:24.869 --> 31:29.036
One of my best friends was
one of the Crabtree boys.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.571
His brothers were supposed to be the ones

31:32.571 --> 31:35.171
that had seen it then.

31:35.171 --> 31:36.608
And I take very much stock in what

31:36.608 --> 31:40.191
they say is being the
truth as they see it.

31:41.686 --> 31:43.790
- [Lyle] Smokey's son Lynn had one of the

31:43.790 --> 31:45.776
most legendary sightings.

31:45.776 --> 31:49.026
In 1965 when Lynn was just 14 years old

31:50.029 --> 31:52.276
he encountered the
creature on the backside

31:52.276 --> 31:54.375
of their property while hunting squirrel

31:54.375 --> 31:57.792
in the woods that bordered Crabtree lake.

31:59.072 --> 32:00.799
It was early evening when Lynn heard

32:00.799 --> 32:03.023
what he thought sounded
like the family dog

32:03.023 --> 32:05.449
caught up in a barbed wire fence.

32:05.449 --> 32:08.877
- [Smokey] All at once his
dog got hung up on a fence.

32:08.877 --> 32:11.516
But the dog sounded like
it was killing itself

32:11.516 --> 32:14.885
so he figured I better get outside

32:14.885 --> 32:17.109
and try to get the dog out of there.

32:17.109 --> 32:20.224
So he jumped up and
started running out there.

32:20.224 --> 32:22.960
And when he got to where he could see,

32:22.960 --> 32:25.572
it was that damn creature
making that racket

32:25.572 --> 32:27.899
like a dog hung up in the fence.

32:27.899 --> 32:30.684
And he was standing at the water's edge.

32:30.684 --> 32:33.715
His full back wasn't to the boy.

32:33.715 --> 32:37.616
And the boy was now about
60 steps away from him.

32:37.616 --> 32:40.950
And nothing, nothing between
him and that critter.

32:40.950 --> 32:43.457
He could see the side of his head,

32:43.457 --> 32:47.365
and part of his back,
and all down one side.

32:47.365 --> 32:49.046
And he said that that thing was

32:49.046 --> 32:51.760
letting off body language

32:51.760 --> 32:55.688
that told him he was highly pissed off.

32:55.688 --> 32:57.177
And his arms hanging down,

32:57.177 --> 32:59.985
his arms was longer than his legs.

32:59.985 --> 33:01.640
The way he was crouched.

33:01.640 --> 33:03.854
And he said it looked somewhere between

33:03.854 --> 33:05.521
an animal and a man.

33:06.566 --> 33:09.327
And he said sure enough
the thing did give up.

33:09.327 --> 33:12.380
And he'd walk up that old road.

33:12.380 --> 33:14.282
The way he come down he might not ever

33:14.282 --> 33:16.700
seen the boy standing out there.

33:16.700 --> 33:19.914
Walked toward that boy looking down.

33:19.914 --> 33:22.530
And he smelled the boy before he seen him.

33:22.530 --> 33:24.548
And he stopped real short

33:24.548 --> 33:28.367
and he went to breathing all in the air.

33:28.367 --> 33:31.761
And directly that joker spotted him.

33:31.761 --> 33:34.960
And he didn't take his
eyes off of him again.

33:34.960 --> 33:37.296
He kept smelling the air

33:37.296 --> 33:40.728
and he kept bending over
farther and farther.

33:40.728 --> 33:43.690
He wanted to know what that kid was.

33:43.690 --> 33:45.945
But he didn't wanna get any closer.

33:45.945 --> 33:48.472
He said the thing looked
enough like an animal

33:48.472 --> 33:50.733
he wasn't fixing to talk to it.

33:50.733 --> 33:52.097
But it looked enough like a man

33:52.097 --> 33:53.986
that he was scared to shoot it.

33:53.986 --> 33:56.614
So he stood up and got to shuffling.

33:56.614 --> 33:59.213
And so then the thing just started slowly

33:59.213 --> 34:01.317
easing on out toward him.

34:01.317 --> 34:02.910
Had hair all over his body.

34:02.910 --> 34:04.484
He said he knew he couldn't hurt it

34:04.484 --> 34:07.038
with it's shotgun, squirrel shot.

34:07.038 --> 34:09.940
So he shot for it's eyes hoping to

34:09.940 --> 34:11.830
make it leave him alone.

34:11.830 --> 34:13.679
Or damage it's eye sight.

34:13.679 --> 34:17.030
Act like it never even heard the shot.

34:17.030 --> 34:20.643
He emptied his gun, shot him a third time.

34:20.643 --> 34:23.936
Then he turned around and
started walking looking back

34:23.936 --> 34:25.684
and loading his gun.

34:25.684 --> 34:28.011
And then the thing wasn't chasing him

34:28.011 --> 34:30.770
but it was moving faster.

34:30.770 --> 34:33.398
Kinda keeping the same distance.

34:33.398 --> 34:35.023
He said, the first thing you know

34:35.023 --> 34:37.777
he was loading his gun while he was shot.

34:37.777 --> 34:40.190
And he said when he got his gun loaded

34:40.190 --> 34:42.813
his fear overtook him.

34:42.813 --> 34:46.868
And he never did stop
and make a stand anymore.

34:46.868 --> 34:49.400
He headed for home and when he got home

34:49.400 --> 34:51.650
he was completely panicked.

34:54.333 --> 34:57.053
- On the Crabtree side,

34:57.053 --> 34:58.535
them boys lived in the woods.

34:58.535 --> 35:01.009
That's where all their food came from.

35:01.009 --> 35:04.463
And most of the time if they saw something

35:04.463 --> 35:07.595
they're not gonna tell
anybody outside of the family.

35:07.595 --> 35:09.610
So it you getting a story from them

35:09.610 --> 35:12.284
it's because they didn't
understand what they saw.

35:12.284 --> 35:13.315
If they understood it,

35:13.315 --> 35:15.377
a lot of times you wouldn't hear about it.

35:15.377 --> 35:16.601
- I hate you tell you,
my great grandmother

35:16.601 --> 35:18.659
told me about this long
before the movie came out.

35:18.659 --> 35:20.904
She would tell usshe was a Crabtree.

35:20.904 --> 35:22.590
She was married to a Jones.

35:22.590 --> 35:24.368
And several of the
characters during that movie

35:24.368 --> 35:27.451
were related to her and to my mother.

35:28.448 --> 35:30.752
They were tight lipped.

35:30.752 --> 35:32.201
Have y'all ever met the Crabtree's?

35:32.201 --> 35:34.987
Or the Jones', they are
tight lipped people.

35:34.987 --> 35:36.586
They keep a lot of stuff to their self.

35:36.586 --> 35:38.192
They don't tell a lot of things.

35:38.192 --> 35:40.249
So if you wasn't hearing it from them,

35:40.249 --> 35:42.047
most of the stuff you couldn't believe it.

35:42.047 --> 35:44.222
- [Lyle] While Lynn had the actual

35:44.222 --> 35:45.331
encounter with the creature,

35:45.331 --> 35:46.569
and Travis went on to enjoy

35:46.569 --> 35:49.297
notoriety as the star of a feature film,

35:49.297 --> 35:51.269
their father, Smokey, was the one

35:51.269 --> 35:53.436
who kept the legend alive.

35:54.270 --> 35:56.089
Despite a dramatic disagreement

35:56.089 --> 35:59.090
with Charles Pierce for
the compensation movie,

35:59.090 --> 36:03.050
Smokey never could outrun
the specter of the monster.

36:03.050 --> 36:05.529
He pinned three books on the subject,

36:05.529 --> 36:06.796
appeared in documentaries

36:06.796 --> 36:09.285
and television news
segments discussing it.

36:09.285 --> 36:11.090
And was generally acknowledged to be the

36:11.090 --> 36:13.510
authority On the Fouke creature.

36:13.510 --> 36:16.387
Ironically, despite his
significant association

36:16.387 --> 36:17.627
with the monster,

36:17.627 --> 36:20.754
Smokey never had a sighting for himself.

36:20.754 --> 36:23.754
In 2016 Smokey Crabtree passed away.

36:24.917 --> 36:26.846
Right up until his death he was still

36:26.846 --> 36:28.651
searching for the beast that had

36:28.651 --> 36:31.401
haunted him for much of his life.

36:32.748 --> 36:34.101
Among those who have crossed paths

36:34.101 --> 36:36.682
with the Boggy Creek
monster I've found few

36:36.682 --> 36:39.426
more credible than Terry Sutton.

36:39.426 --> 36:43.117
He came to me with a story
unlike any I'd heard.

36:43.117 --> 36:45.449
Not simply because he had
seen the creature lurking

36:45.449 --> 36:47.308
in the woods behind his home,

36:47.308 --> 36:50.518
but because the lasting
effects were apparent.

36:50.518 --> 36:52.328
Add to this that Terry had never spoken

36:52.328 --> 36:55.501
publicly about his sighting
prior to my interview.

36:55.501 --> 36:57.974
And you have a unique
story that stands apart

36:57.974 --> 37:00.235
from many of the Fouke encounters.

37:00.235 --> 37:02.652
- It was in February in 1982.

37:04.112 --> 37:05.674
- I think that was definitely one of the

37:05.674 --> 37:08.891
significant things when I talked to you

37:08.891 --> 37:11.032
about the date of your experience,

37:11.032 --> 37:15.494
because that was sort of showed
that the thing continued.

37:15.494 --> 37:18.244
When the media frenzy had stopped

37:19.431 --> 37:23.151
and all that moved on, yet
sightings still occurred.

37:23.151 --> 37:26.155
So it was a significant point and

37:26.155 --> 37:28.049
one of the first in the 80's.

37:28.049 --> 37:32.472
Because the 70's are what a lot
of people's impression were.

37:32.472 --> 37:34.091
Wow that was a movie and a bunch of people

37:34.091 --> 37:36.854
had sightings then and
it all just went away.

37:36.854 --> 37:39.751
Maybe the media, and the
press, and the movie went away,

37:39.751 --> 37:42.794
but for somebody who
lived here it continued.

37:42.794 --> 37:45.260
- When you look back on your life

37:45.260 --> 37:47.201
it kinda runs in fast forward

37:47.201 --> 37:49.219
and there's a lot of fuzzy areas.

37:49.219 --> 37:50.920
Majority of your life is kind of fuzzy.

37:50.920 --> 37:53.684
But there's certain
events that are very vivid

37:53.684 --> 37:56.330
and that day is still kind of replays

37:56.330 --> 37:59.001
like a movie in my head, it's very vivid.

37:59.001 --> 38:02.510
So I came down here, the boat was parked

38:02.510 --> 38:04.365
on the end where it always was.

38:04.365 --> 38:06.625
Got in the boat, went around,

38:06.625 --> 38:09.388
and then fished up in the net.

38:09.388 --> 38:13.055
At the end of the day
I was coming back out.

38:14.044 --> 38:16.711
And right about this corner here

38:18.075 --> 38:20.122
when I came around the bend is when

38:20.122 --> 38:22.372
I noticed that the creature

38:24.467 --> 38:27.134
was walking down toward the levy

38:28.312 --> 38:30.895
and then down toward the creek.

38:32.383 --> 38:34.767
I stopped obviously and watched him

38:34.767 --> 38:36.434
walk on to the levy.

38:37.559 --> 38:40.067
And then didn't move until I saw him

38:40.067 --> 38:42.288
disappear over the hill.

38:42.288 --> 38:45.711
It was probably about, it
was roughly seven feet tall.

38:45.711 --> 38:48.646
He was thin, had black hair.

38:48.646 --> 38:50.979
Had noticeably poor posture.

38:51.946 --> 38:55.495
Walked slumped over, shoulders forward,

38:55.495 --> 38:57.649
and a very long stride.

38:57.649 --> 38:59.085
- [Lyle] Terry's father, Lloyd,

38:59.085 --> 39:02.469
knows as much about Fouke
and it's history as anyone.

39:02.469 --> 39:05.027
An amateur photographer,
Lloyd raised Terry

39:05.027 --> 39:08.030
to be a man who could
handle things for himself.

39:08.030 --> 39:12.248
And neither of them are given
to tall tales or hysteria.

39:12.248 --> 39:14.053
Lloyd played a key role in establishing

39:14.053 --> 39:16.312
the validity of Terry's story.

39:16.312 --> 39:18.813
While he himself has
never seen the creature,

39:18.813 --> 39:21.113
his memories of the night Terry did

39:21.113 --> 39:25.289
are as vivid as if he had
encountered it for himself.

39:25.289 --> 39:30.113
- And Terry had just got to
the house, when I drove up.

39:30.113 --> 39:32.251
And he came out on the patio there

39:32.251 --> 39:34.366
and he had his hands over his face.

39:34.366 --> 39:35.764
I said, "Terry what's the matter?"

39:35.764 --> 39:38.606
He said, "Daddy I just saw
the monster down at the pond."

39:38.606 --> 39:41.127
I already believed it before he saw it.

39:41.127 --> 39:43.895
I talked to a lot of people
who have seen it before.

39:43.895 --> 39:47.395
He made a believer out of a lot of people.

39:48.357 --> 39:50.466
Because he's so reliable,

39:50.466 --> 39:52.352
they know that he would not make something

39:52.352 --> 39:53.969
like that up.

39:53.969 --> 39:56.356
- Obviously for someone
who talks to people

39:56.356 --> 39:58.106
like this frequently,

39:59.972 --> 40:01.453
it's not isolated to any one person.

40:01.453 --> 40:04.497
This is something everybody
has to face and come out.

40:04.497 --> 40:06.650
And of course I appreciate you

40:06.650 --> 40:07.811
taking me through this because

40:07.811 --> 40:10.906
I know it's a personal event and something

40:10.906 --> 40:13.476
that can have lasting
effects over the years.

40:13.476 --> 40:16.866
- In reflection, it's just a fact

40:16.866 --> 40:19.212
of something that happened.

40:19.212 --> 40:22.787
And even taking all the emotion out of it

40:22.787 --> 40:25.157
it's just a fact of something
that happened in your life.

40:25.157 --> 40:26.630
It's an event in your life.

40:26.630 --> 40:29.586
And whether people believe it
or not is their own choice.

40:29.586 --> 40:33.086
But you can't deny the fact of what I saw.

40:36.111 --> 40:37.636
- [Lyle] The Suttons live in the

40:37.636 --> 40:38.857
small community of Jonesville,

40:38.857 --> 40:41.444
where in the 1960's a number of sightings

40:41.444 --> 40:45.833
of what was then dubbed The
Jonesville Monster occurred.

40:45.833 --> 40:47.932
It's perhaps no coincidence that so many

40:47.932 --> 40:49.736
of these early occurrences took place

40:49.736 --> 40:52.873
from the relative safety of a car.

40:52.873 --> 40:54.565
Typically, the driver sees little more

40:54.565 --> 40:57.033
than a large black shape crossing the road

40:57.033 --> 40:59.642
as it darts into the woods at high speed.

40:59.642 --> 41:01.455
It makes sense that so many sightings

41:01.455 --> 41:03.399
occur on roads.

41:03.399 --> 41:05.702
Any animal traversing the dense forest

41:05.702 --> 41:08.297
and endless swamps that
cover southern Arkansas

41:08.297 --> 41:09.859
must eventually make their way across

41:09.859 --> 41:12.420
the black top gravel or dirt pathways

41:12.420 --> 41:14.587
that crisscross the state.

41:17.283 --> 41:20.874
As far back as 1955,
two Jonesville residents

41:20.874 --> 41:23.622
recounted seeing a creature
that, as they put it,

41:23.622 --> 41:26.520
walked like a man but was
too hairy to be a man,

41:26.520 --> 41:30.520
crossed the road as they
were driving one night.

41:32.316 --> 41:35.223
In 1965 a young Fouke boy claimed to see

41:35.223 --> 41:39.483
a large hairy beast while
walking on a dirt road.

41:39.483 --> 41:40.952
The boy went on to say that the being

41:40.952 --> 41:42.177
had attempted to chase him before

41:42.177 --> 41:45.277
disappearing into the woods.

41:45.277 --> 41:47.291
On year later a school bus driver saw

41:47.291 --> 41:51.116
the same creature in
the early morning hours.

41:51.116 --> 41:53.670
During 1971 several sightings of a monkey

41:53.670 --> 41:56.386
or a gorilla like creature came in.

41:56.386 --> 41:57.994
One of the most memorable occurred just

41:57.994 --> 42:00.883
weeks after the infamous Ford incident.

42:00.883 --> 42:03.226
In this case three people
saw the alleged creature

42:03.226 --> 42:06.611
cross the road very near Boggy Creek.

42:06.611 --> 42:08.312
It seems that simply driving from

42:08.312 --> 42:10.697
one destination to
another in Miller County

42:10.697 --> 42:13.827
can lead to an encounter
with the legend itself.

42:13.827 --> 42:15.593
- Back then it was a lot of excitement.

42:15.593 --> 42:17.032
The movie had just come out.

42:17.032 --> 42:18.341
It's fresh in everybody's mind.

42:18.341 --> 42:20.964
And sightings up and down 71 Highway

42:20.964 --> 42:23.540
between Texarkana and Shreveport.

42:23.540 --> 42:26.452
Just almost every day
someone saw something.

42:26.452 --> 42:29.848
If they didn't see anything
I think they made it up.

42:29.848 --> 42:31.528
- One report was from actually a

42:31.528 --> 42:33.768
deputy sheriff and his family.

42:33.768 --> 42:36.141
They drove near Boggy Creek,

42:36.141 --> 42:38.969
they coming traveling north on 71.

42:38.969 --> 42:40.552
And one of the family members noticed

42:40.552 --> 42:44.098
something standing on
the west side of the road

42:44.098 --> 42:46.263
and alerted the driver.

42:46.263 --> 42:48.775
And he started slowing down
because it was unusual.

42:48.775 --> 42:51.288
Just then all of a sudden
it got up and ran across.

42:51.288 --> 42:54.003
In a matter of a few
yards in front of 'em.

42:54.003 --> 42:58.170
And said he was a large, big,
gorilla looking like thing.

42:59.038 --> 43:01.218
And he said he went across
and bounded over a fence

43:01.218 --> 43:02.859
and just kept going.

43:02.859 --> 43:04.090
- And a year and a half ago

43:04.090 --> 43:06.595
somebody told me you
need to talk to somebody.

43:06.595 --> 43:09.438
I said, "This guy, he's like
one of my best friends."

43:09.438 --> 43:11.438
He lives in south Texas.

43:12.390 --> 43:15.272
I called him and I said, "You
need to tell me a story."

43:15.272 --> 43:17.575
He said, "You know
Gifford Hills, that place

43:17.575 --> 43:19.753
"we parked at all the
time on south state line?"

43:19.753 --> 43:21.719
I said "Oh yeah, I know it well."

43:21.719 --> 43:24.354
He said, "I started walking
down that road one morning,

43:24.354 --> 43:27.123
"and I got about 50 yards down that road.

43:27.123 --> 43:29.560
"And I look up and there's something

43:29.560 --> 43:31.444
"standing in the middle of that road.

43:31.444 --> 43:32.637
"And I stopped."

43:32.637 --> 43:35.034
I said, "You know me, I
got guns, I got pistols,

43:35.034 --> 43:37.633
"I got my shotgun, I'm ready to go.

43:37.633 --> 43:39.732
"I'm talking to it.

43:39.732 --> 43:41.649
"I said "Who are you?!"

43:42.847 --> 43:44.115
"It didn't answer.

43:44.115 --> 43:46.658
"I said, "Hey man I got a gun."

43:46.658 --> 43:48.622
He said, "I'll kill ya."

43:48.622 --> 43:51.879
And that's exactly how he talked.

43:51.879 --> 43:54.836
He said, all of a sudden
it wasn't one thing there

43:54.836 --> 43:56.944
there was two things standing there.

43:56.944 --> 44:00.361
And it just slightly just
strolled across the road.

44:00.361 --> 44:03.745
- It was September the 25th 2011.

44:03.745 --> 44:06.048
I had went over to a friend of mines house

44:06.048 --> 44:07.810
to do some school work.

44:07.810 --> 44:10.236
It was probably getting
close around midnight.

44:10.236 --> 44:12.059
I got ready, packed my books up,

44:12.059 --> 44:14.282
packed my laptop up.

44:14.282 --> 44:17.482
And went outside to put it all in my car.

44:17.482 --> 44:20.546
I noticed whenever I went outside,

44:20.546 --> 44:24.464
that it was just kind
of strangely just quiet.

44:24.464 --> 44:26.214
No crickets, nothing.

44:29.367 --> 44:33.034
I get down her driveway
and I turn on to 206

44:33.885 --> 44:36.961
and then took a right and turned onto 40.

44:36.961 --> 44:40.006
Headed towards 10 which
is towards my house.

44:40.006 --> 44:42.807
And as I came around the
curb and came up the hill,

44:42.807 --> 44:44.283
there was a pasture over here

44:44.283 --> 44:45.807
and they had been rolling some hay up

44:45.807 --> 44:48.159
to get ready to be moved.

44:48.159 --> 44:51.334
Well there was a couple
rolls out in the field.

44:51.334 --> 44:54.710
I don't know if it like turned around

44:54.710 --> 44:57.102
or was squatted and came up,

44:57.102 --> 45:00.791
but something caught my
eye over in this field.

45:00.791 --> 45:03.137
And as my lights shined on it,

45:03.137 --> 45:05.813
I could see like the greenish color,

45:05.813 --> 45:09.404
like a deer would whenever you see a deer.

45:09.404 --> 45:10.821
And I noticed it.

45:11.703 --> 45:14.733
The roll of hay was about five foot.

45:14.733 --> 45:17.484
Whenever I noticed it, where it was at,

45:17.484 --> 45:20.615
the roll of hay was right here on it.

45:20.615 --> 45:22.966
As I seen it, it's just like it happened

45:22.966 --> 45:26.881
in an instant, so fast
and so gracefully almost.

45:26.881 --> 45:29.095
It runs across the field

45:29.095 --> 45:31.922
and darts off in front of my car.

45:31.922 --> 45:33.314
I slam on my brakes.

45:33.314 --> 45:36.435
Literally from here to here.

45:36.435 --> 45:38.811
I could see the monster plain as day.

45:38.811 --> 45:40.986
It was like in a running man position.

45:40.986 --> 45:44.072
I could see it's feet, it's hair.

45:44.072 --> 45:46.982
It was more like a course
looking dark brown.

45:46.982 --> 45:49.679
It had leaves all over the back of it.

45:49.679 --> 45:51.852
I could see the muscles movement

45:51.852 --> 45:56.123
of like the legs, the muscle
structure of the legs,

45:56.123 --> 45:59.790
and the arms, and around
the back and stuff.

46:00.839 --> 46:02.756
It was, pretty massive.

46:04.635 --> 46:06.357
And it just crosses the road into

46:06.357 --> 46:09.274
like a brush and barbed wire fence.

46:10.984 --> 46:13.587
Frightened me yeah, excited, just kind of

46:13.587 --> 46:16.226
a little bit excited and a
little bit of frightened.

46:16.226 --> 46:18.372
Because I mean you don't know whether

46:18.372 --> 46:20.455
it could be mad or, what.

46:24.780 --> 46:27.280
- My encounter with this thing

46:29.155 --> 46:31.488
occurred on a day I had been

46:32.752 --> 46:35.164
trying to get close to an alligator.

46:35.164 --> 46:37.501
I love to take photos of animals.

46:37.501 --> 46:40.678
Love to take alligators is my passion.

46:40.678 --> 46:44.324
I've walked up within 15 feet
of a 500 pound black bear.

46:44.324 --> 46:47.556
I've walked up on a cow, elk.

46:47.556 --> 46:50.851
Snakes, I do wildlife rehab so I handle

46:50.851 --> 46:54.204
baby animals on a frequent basis.

46:54.204 --> 46:57.568
And was on my way to a different location

46:57.568 --> 46:58.835
that my cousin had told me about.

46:58.835 --> 47:01.106
That hey you can see alligators down here.

47:01.106 --> 47:03.341
Was driving down this dirt road

47:03.341 --> 47:05.008
and going real slow.

47:06.008 --> 47:09.184
And probably 50 yards,
75 yards in front of me.

47:09.184 --> 47:12.923
I catch a glimpse of something
coming out of the woods.

47:12.923 --> 47:16.189
It was on two legs running straight up.

47:16.189 --> 47:18.121
Seven or eight foot tall.

47:18.121 --> 47:20.154
And it makes three strides and it's

47:20.154 --> 47:22.462
across the road and into the woods.

47:22.462 --> 47:25.340
Then counter itself split seconds.

47:25.340 --> 47:27.115
I mean, and it was just.

47:27.115 --> 47:29.134
You kinda sit there dazed.

47:29.134 --> 47:32.344
'Cause nothing in any
kind of wildlife book

47:32.344 --> 47:34.525
or any kind of thing you've ever seen

47:34.525 --> 47:37.275
can describe what I've just seen.

47:38.719 --> 47:40.219
And what was that?

47:41.282 --> 47:45.411
And within 15, 20 seconds
I hear something holler.

47:45.411 --> 47:46.851
And I pulled a three point turn

47:46.851 --> 47:49.351
in the dirt road and take off.

47:51.245 --> 47:53.335
- [Lyle] Doyle Holmes lives
near the river bottoms,

47:53.335 --> 47:56.013
a good distance from downtown Fouke.

47:56.013 --> 47:58.522
A family man with a love
for hunting and fishing,

47:58.522 --> 48:03.274
Doyle knows these woods
better than almost anyone.

48:03.274 --> 48:04.964
Doyle claims a couple of encounters

48:04.964 --> 48:06.538
with the creature and what happens

48:06.538 --> 48:08.139
to be the same areas one of the

48:08.139 --> 48:12.010
Legend of Boggy Creek's most
notable characters resided.

48:12.010 --> 48:14.233
In the film, young
Travis Crabtree drops by

48:14.233 --> 48:17.249
to visit an old hermit named Herb Jones

48:17.249 --> 48:19.687
who lives deep within the bottoms.

48:19.687 --> 48:22.074
The scene was based in reality as some

48:22.074 --> 48:26.137
of the locals did visit Herb
Jones whenever possible.

48:26.137 --> 48:29.298
Despite living in prime
Boggy Creek monster habitat,

48:29.298 --> 48:32.383
Herb claimed to have
never seen the creature.

48:32.383 --> 48:34.529
Before we write off
the creatures existence

48:34.529 --> 48:37.453
based on the testimony
of one person however,

48:37.453 --> 48:39.539
keep in mind that much like the creature,

48:39.539 --> 48:42.451
Herb shunned civilization
and wouldn't have

48:42.451 --> 48:44.371
wanted hoards of people
disturbing his peace

48:44.371 --> 48:47.157
and quiet as they searched for the monster

48:47.157 --> 48:48.824
in his own backyard.

48:50.009 --> 48:51.934
Few people I've
encountered have run across

48:51.934 --> 48:55.305
the Boggy Creek monster
on more than one occasion.

48:55.305 --> 48:58.214
Even fewer are the times
I find it believable.

48:58.214 --> 49:00.956
After all, we've been
searching for the creature

49:00.956 --> 49:04.770
for decades, maybe even
centuries with no luck.

49:04.770 --> 49:06.383
What are the odds that one man would

49:06.383 --> 49:10.145
run across it more than
once in his lifetime?

49:10.145 --> 49:11.869
However, given Doyle's proximity

49:11.869 --> 49:14.850
to an isolated, underpopulated
stretch of woods,

49:14.850 --> 49:18.089
and a murky lake that
sees few human intruders,

49:18.089 --> 49:19.339
it is possible.

49:20.753 --> 49:23.684
So take me through the incident

49:23.684 --> 49:27.767
where you saw the creature
in the Cypress canopy.

49:29.965 --> 49:33.507
How did you get in that
position, what did you see?

49:33.507 --> 49:37.092
- Back in 2004 I decided to get up early

49:37.092 --> 49:39.024
and go fishing one morning.

49:39.024 --> 49:41.344
Unloaded the canoe and put it in

49:41.344 --> 49:44.104
right before the sun
come up in the morning.

49:44.104 --> 49:46.826
I want to be out before daylight

49:46.826 --> 49:49.133
to have my lines in the water.

49:49.133 --> 49:52.034
And about 30 minutes later

49:52.034 --> 49:53.586
as the sun started to come up

49:53.586 --> 49:56.818
I could hear a splash in the distance.

49:56.818 --> 49:58.840
So I kinda wanted to get a little closer

49:58.840 --> 49:59.862
to see what it was.

49:59.862 --> 50:02.276
So I easily paddled over

50:02.276 --> 50:05.726
through the mist of the early morning.

50:05.726 --> 50:08.611
As the sun started to get just

50:08.611 --> 50:11.255
a little bit high in the trees
and shine through the mist

50:11.255 --> 50:14.336
I could see a two legged figure

50:14.336 --> 50:17.503
off in the distance under the cypress.

50:18.349 --> 50:21.015
And the water was up over the land

50:21.015 --> 50:24.187
and he was kicking around in the water

50:24.187 --> 50:28.188
making loud splashes like he
was looking for something.

50:28.188 --> 50:31.021
And at that point I kinda paddled,

50:32.654 --> 50:34.862
see if I could get any closer

50:34.862 --> 50:36.861
without him seeing me.

50:36.861 --> 50:39.572
And there was a point where I could

50:39.572 --> 50:42.072
feel that he knew I was there.

50:43.290 --> 50:46.961
What I was looking at was very large.

50:46.961 --> 50:49.294
Very large legs, hairy legs.

50:50.338 --> 50:51.879
And you could tell what it was

50:51.879 --> 50:55.552
was a very powerful bipedal animal.

50:55.552 --> 50:57.969
- What would you estimate the height to be

50:57.969 --> 50:59.639
if you could take a estimation.

50:59.639 --> 51:01.268
- At that point by his legs

51:01.268 --> 51:02.629
I would have to say that it was

51:02.629 --> 51:04.071
at least seven feet.

51:04.071 --> 51:08.640
It looked like an animal
weighing at least 500 pounds.

51:08.640 --> 51:10.929
- [Lyle] Despite occurring
in the early 2000's

51:10.929 --> 51:12.410
Doyle's description is much the same

51:12.410 --> 51:16.399
as Terry Sutton's who's
sighting happened in 1982.

51:16.399 --> 51:21.019
Or Will Lunsford's who saw it
as a boy in the late 1970's.

51:21.019 --> 51:22.873
As a matter of fact, their descriptions

51:22.873 --> 51:24.869
sound nearly identical to what people

51:24.869 --> 51:27.373
were seeing prior to The
Legend of Boggy Creek

51:27.373 --> 51:29.706
and on back into the 1950's.

51:30.546 --> 51:31.832
And what about those reports

51:31.832 --> 51:34.754
of hairy wild men from the 1800's?

51:34.754 --> 51:36.384
While the descriptions from the 1800's

51:36.384 --> 51:39.304
are wrapped in terminology
we don't use today,

51:39.304 --> 51:42.264
at their most basic, what
people were describing

51:42.264 --> 51:45.348
was an upright, hair
covered, man like being

51:45.348 --> 51:48.598
who shunned mankind and kept to itself.

51:49.816 --> 51:51.856
The Boggy Creek monster didn't just appear

51:51.856 --> 51:54.945
in 1971 when it made headlines.

51:54.945 --> 51:57.028
It's been here all along.

51:58.324 --> 52:01.240
- There are rumors years ago
of a train, a circus train.

52:01.240 --> 52:03.451
We got two railroad tracks just over here.

52:03.451 --> 52:04.871
Probably not even a mile.

52:04.871 --> 52:06.495
Of a circus train wreck and something

52:06.495 --> 52:07.328
could have got off that circus train.

52:07.328 --> 52:08.544
So I went to the world books,

52:08.544 --> 52:09.918
I looked through all the animals.

52:09.918 --> 52:11.917
It was not a sloth.

52:11.917 --> 52:13.710
It was not any kind of bear.

52:13.710 --> 52:15.753
It wasn't anything, the
closest it resembled like

52:15.753 --> 52:17.290
said it resembled an ape.

52:17.290 --> 52:19.258
Like a gorilla, except
an eight foot gorilla

52:19.258 --> 52:21.170
that weighs about 800 pounds.

52:21.170 --> 52:22.938
- Talked to so many people that lived

52:22.938 --> 52:25.015
in this area that has actually seen

52:25.015 --> 52:26.761
something in their yard.

52:26.761 --> 52:29.475
They claimed it to be a gorilla.

52:29.475 --> 52:31.218
A monkey type animal.

52:31.218 --> 52:33.735
And some even believed it was a large bear

52:33.735 --> 52:35.403
until it ran off.

52:35.403 --> 52:37.237
Then the story changes.

52:37.237 --> 52:40.864
I've talked to hunters that's
been ran out of the woods.

52:40.864 --> 52:42.326
Unexplained noises.

52:42.326 --> 52:44.368
I got friends that claim people

52:44.368 --> 52:47.535
have turned apes loose in this area.

52:47.535 --> 52:49.798
- It's not a panther.

52:49.798 --> 52:52.130
No way, it's not an animal.

52:52.130 --> 52:54.211
An animal would.

52:54.211 --> 52:55.419
You know, panthers don't go in

52:55.419 --> 52:58.426
and beat on a window
trying to get into a house.

52:58.426 --> 53:01.342
And a panther don't do
the different things

53:01.342 --> 53:02.887
that people saying.

53:02.887 --> 53:04.177
This is definitely wrong.

53:04.177 --> 53:06.554
This is something that was knowledgeable.

53:06.554 --> 53:08.473
Something that knew how to enter a house.

53:08.473 --> 53:10.728
Been knocking on a window,
knocking on a door.

53:10.728 --> 53:13.648
Things such as that, so
this is not the animal.

53:13.648 --> 53:15.147
- Whenever it ran from the hay bail

53:15.147 --> 53:16.656
to the front of my car it was just like,

53:16.656 --> 53:17.984
I had this image.

53:17.984 --> 53:20.569
Just like picture image
in front of my head.

53:20.569 --> 53:24.364
I could see the muscle
movement of like the legs.

53:24.364 --> 53:28.281
The muscle structure of
the legs, and the arms,

53:29.290 --> 53:31.079
and around the back and stuff.

53:31.079 --> 53:33.956
It's hands and feet were actually darker

53:33.956 --> 53:35.670
than the hair color.

53:35.670 --> 53:39.258
Kind of like a monkey or an ape would be.

53:39.258 --> 53:40.837
- [Lyle] As for evidence of the monster,

53:40.837 --> 53:43.756
I keep going back to the three toed track.

53:43.756 --> 53:45.720
Why three toes?

53:45.720 --> 53:48.973
If it's not a hoax or a
misidentified natural animal,

53:48.973 --> 53:52.652
then what kind of bipedal,
seven foot tall creature

53:52.652 --> 53:56.565
can carry itself on a foot
with only three digits?

53:56.565 --> 53:58.789
A few years ago while
hog hunting in the same

53:58.789 --> 54:00.902
area where his encounters occurred,

54:00.902 --> 54:03.569
Doyle and his son found a line of tracks

54:03.569 --> 54:06.909
not unlike those found in
Willy Smith's bean field.

54:06.909 --> 54:09.409
Only this time with five toes.

54:11.242 --> 54:13.220
As with so many of the mysteries connected

54:13.220 --> 54:14.953
to the Boggy Creek monster,

54:14.953 --> 54:18.260
this seems to raise even more questions.

54:18.260 --> 54:22.178
A lot of people say that the
Fouke monster has three toes.

54:22.178 --> 54:25.801
And I mean this goes back
to what the movie portrayed

54:25.801 --> 54:29.168
and it has become something associated

54:29.168 --> 54:30.572
with the Fouke monster.

54:30.572 --> 54:31.981
But this is a five toed--

54:31.981 --> 54:33.350
- Yes.

54:33.350 --> 54:35.841
- Which is closer to what we see as

54:35.841 --> 54:37.870
Bigfoot tracks.

54:37.870 --> 54:40.730
In your opinion does it seem more natural

54:40.730 --> 54:42.402
that it has five toes?

54:42.402 --> 54:45.978
- Yeah, I've personally never seen any

54:45.978 --> 54:49.447
three toed tracks that didn't
turn out to be a crane.

54:49.447 --> 54:51.635
All the tracks we've seen since,

54:51.635 --> 54:54.207
and we've seen quite a
few in the berry patches

54:54.207 --> 54:57.206
through the years and
they all had five toes.

54:57.206 --> 55:01.373
(loud rumbling)
(ominous music)

55:16.367 --> 55:18.436
- [Lyle] Few elements of
The Legend of Boggy Creek

55:18.436 --> 55:22.193
are as memorable as the
creatures famous scream.

55:22.193 --> 55:24.821
But was the scream based in reality?

55:24.821 --> 55:26.741
It seems that way.

55:26.741 --> 55:29.407
In 1916 a family traveling near Fouke

55:29.407 --> 55:31.243
encountered a hairy figure that let out

55:31.243 --> 55:33.537
a bone chilling shriek.

55:33.537 --> 55:35.120
And there have been other reports of

55:35.120 --> 55:39.003
bizarre sounds emanating
from the woods of the area.

55:39.003 --> 55:41.086
Smokey Crabtree himself reported hearing

55:41.086 --> 55:44.754
a strange scream near his home
on more than one occasion.

55:44.754 --> 55:47.219
And in my own files I
have plenty of reports

55:47.219 --> 55:49.470
from around Fouke of a bizarre scream

55:49.470 --> 55:53.225
or yell accompanied by
sightings of the creature.

55:53.225 --> 55:56.182
It seems that whatever the
Boggy Creek monster may be,

55:56.182 --> 55:58.478
it's not as shy about being heard

55:58.478 --> 56:01.065
as it is about being seen.

56:01.065 --> 56:03.188
While preparing to film Doyle's interview,

56:03.188 --> 56:05.025
we heard what might very well be

56:05.025 --> 56:07.654
the creatures call for ourselves.

56:07.654 --> 56:09.090
Is that (mumbles)?

56:09.090 --> 56:10.460
- [Doyle] That was a tree knot.

56:10.460 --> 56:14.563
Well this is about the
time you start to hear 'em.

56:14.563 --> 56:16.289
- [Narrator] Doyle, do you hear it?

56:16.289 --> 56:17.373
- [Narrator] What was that?

56:17.373 --> 56:18.830
What was that?

56:18.830 --> 56:21.080
- [Narrator] Probably one of them.

56:21.080 --> 56:23.345
- [Narrator] I'm recording.

56:23.345 --> 56:26.086
- [Narrator] Yeah this is the
time you start to hear 'em.

56:26.086 --> 56:29.003
- [Narrator] Can you take a step...

56:31.190 --> 56:32.676
- [Narrator] What was that?

56:32.676 --> 56:35.727
(crickets)

56:35.727 --> 56:37.977
- [Narrator] Getting close.

56:39.521 --> 56:40.906
(ominous music)

56:40.906 --> 56:42.314
- [Lyle] Though we can't say for sure,

56:42.314 --> 56:44.400
it's entirely possible that Doyle and I

56:44.400 --> 56:46.234
had a brush with the same creature

56:46.234 --> 56:49.866
who has stalked this land for decades.

56:49.866 --> 56:54.696
- I believe this creature to
be a primate of some sort.

56:54.696 --> 56:56.119
I've been a lot of places.

56:56.119 --> 56:59.330
I've probably been in
35 different countries

56:59.330 --> 57:02.376
and heard a lot of different
animals out in the woods.

57:02.376 --> 57:05.293
This particular animal I
hadn't heard very much.

57:05.293 --> 57:07.945
The only thing I can associate the sound

57:07.945 --> 57:11.810
that I've heard out of the
woods is a Howler monkey.

57:11.810 --> 57:14.055
And they're not indigenous
to south Arkansas.

57:14.055 --> 57:15.849
They're just not here.

57:15.849 --> 57:18.683
But it's the closest
thing I can come up with.

57:18.683 --> 57:22.352
- And it was a holler
modeled with a scream.

57:22.352 --> 57:24.006
I can't imitate that sound,

57:24.006 --> 57:25.703
but it was horrifying.

57:25.703 --> 57:28.191
I've heard bears make sounds.

57:28.191 --> 57:31.711
I've heard bobcats, I've
heard panthers make sounds.

57:31.711 --> 57:35.400
And they can make your hair stand on end,

57:35.400 --> 57:38.699
but this was horrifying in sound.

57:38.699 --> 57:40.753
And like I said, nothing that even

57:40.753 --> 57:42.750
comes close to comparing

57:42.750 --> 57:44.417
what that sound was.

57:45.837 --> 57:47.671
- [Lyle] If the monster was truly real,

57:47.671 --> 57:49.171
then the creature has to have

57:49.171 --> 57:50.923
a sustainable population.

57:50.923 --> 57:54.591
There can't be just one
Boggy Creek monster.

57:54.591 --> 57:56.425
While reports of the creature do share

57:56.425 --> 57:58.016
a general description,

57:58.016 --> 57:59.890
there are variations in hair color,

57:59.890 --> 58:03.480
size, facial features, and even attitude.

58:03.480 --> 58:05.229
It's not something you hear of

58:05.229 --> 58:06.731
as often as sightings of large

58:06.731 --> 58:08.567
presumable adult creatures,

58:08.567 --> 58:11.532
but reports of juveniles do come in.

58:11.532 --> 58:14.530
The idea had apparently come
to Charles Pierce himself

58:14.530 --> 58:17.782
as the inevitable sequel to
The Legend of Boggy Creek,

58:17.782 --> 58:20.867
titled Boggy Creek 2 The Legend Continues.

58:20.867 --> 58:23.580
Featured not only the
classic marauding monster,

58:23.580 --> 58:26.253
but it's offspring as well.

58:26.253 --> 58:29.708
Like all good stories,
Boggy Creek 2's baby monster

58:29.708 --> 58:32.255
seems to have been rooted in reality.

58:32.255 --> 58:33.960
True that I saw again,

58:33.960 --> 58:36.691
seven eight foot tall easily.

58:36.691 --> 58:38.966
And I can't explain to you why

58:38.966 --> 58:41.384
I have the feeling that it was juvenile.

58:41.384 --> 58:43.072
Other than I work with animals

58:43.072 --> 58:45.059
and I see animals all the time

58:45.059 --> 58:47.759
and it did not have an adult appearance.

58:47.759 --> 58:51.676
It was markedly juvenilistic
in characteristic.

58:52.985 --> 58:54.982
But it was not an adult.

58:54.982 --> 58:56.109
Whatever.

58:56.109 --> 58:59.287
It wasn't full grown in my opinion.

58:59.287 --> 59:01.038
- So let's talk about

59:01.038 --> 59:03.613
your latest experience.

59:03.613 --> 59:05.414
Discuss that a little bit.

59:05.414 --> 59:06.720
You said you were coming down,

59:06.720 --> 59:07.920
you were looking for firewood?

59:07.920 --> 59:08.753
Is that right?

59:08.753 --> 59:11.416
Can you take me through
what happened that day?

59:11.416 --> 59:15.426
- Well it was about this time
at night or the afternoon.

59:15.426 --> 59:17.843
And I pulled my old Jeep
down here in the woods

59:17.843 --> 59:21.598
and got my chainsaw and started
cutting up some firewood.

59:21.598 --> 59:25.474
I got off in there, my wife
stayed in the truck watching.

59:25.474 --> 59:29.307
I heard a cry that sounded
kinda like a child.

59:30.146 --> 59:32.693
And so I started making
my way through the brush

59:32.693 --> 59:36.527
to see what it was, to see if
there was a lost kid out here.

59:36.527 --> 59:38.829
And as I made my way

59:38.829 --> 59:41.409
closer to the source of the cry,

59:41.409 --> 59:44.073
it was getting louder and louder

59:44.073 --> 59:47.288
until it almost turned into a scream.

59:47.288 --> 59:50.921
And then when I got to
it through the bushes

59:50.921 --> 59:52.836
and could actually see it,

59:52.836 --> 59:56.503
I was amazed that it
was a juvenile Bigfoot.

59:57.796 --> 59:59.756
Probably about five foot tall.

59:59.756 --> 01:00:02.229
Maybe a little shorter than five foot.

01:00:02.229 --> 01:00:04.261
And covered in hair.

01:00:04.261 --> 01:00:07.392
Surprisingly human in the face.

01:00:07.392 --> 01:00:10.187
And at that point you could hear,

01:00:10.187 --> 01:00:12.937
I guess mom and dad coming.

01:00:12.937 --> 01:00:14.779
And they were getting angry

01:00:14.779 --> 01:00:17.987
'cause they could hear
their baby boy crying.

01:00:17.987 --> 01:00:20.035
They knew he was in distress.

01:00:20.035 --> 01:00:23.415
- So the sound you heard coming,

01:00:23.415 --> 01:00:24.248
describe that.

01:00:24.248 --> 01:00:28.415
- It sounded like it was four
or 500 yards away at first.

01:00:29.665 --> 01:00:32.336
But they started getting louder and louder

01:00:32.336 --> 01:00:33.835
and it was getting closer.

01:00:33.835 --> 01:00:35.755
I got back on shore and
I looked at the truck

01:00:35.755 --> 01:00:37.338
and nobody's in it.

01:00:38.509 --> 01:00:40.720
And I go, "Where is my wife at?"

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:43.051
And so I run to the truck and

01:00:43.051 --> 01:00:47.016
saw her, she was hiding in
the floorboard of the truck.

01:00:47.016 --> 01:00:49.473
She had heard the sound
of the big ones coming,

01:00:49.473 --> 01:00:52.229
it scared her so she
rolled the windows up,

01:00:52.229 --> 01:00:56.396
locked the doors, and hid in
the floorboard of the truck.

01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:58.690
- [Lyle] It's been over four decades

01:00:58.690 --> 01:01:00.681
since it first appeared in my life.

01:01:00.681 --> 01:01:04.538
And I still know very
little about the creature.

01:01:04.538 --> 01:01:06.729
Like many of those who
claim to have seen it,

01:01:06.729 --> 01:01:08.529
it's hard to believe.

01:01:08.529 --> 01:01:10.295
The mysteries that surround the case

01:01:10.295 --> 01:01:15.009
are as perplexing today as
they were a century ago.

01:01:15.009 --> 01:01:16.792
If it is real, the so called monster

01:01:16.792 --> 01:01:18.987
seems to be ape like in appearance.

01:01:18.987 --> 01:01:23.136
Covered in hair and has a
foot with three to five toes.

01:01:23.136 --> 01:01:24.972
It keeps to the isolated,

01:01:24.972 --> 01:01:27.389
uninhabited regions of Miller County.

01:01:27.389 --> 01:01:29.725
Only occasionally venturing down waterways

01:01:29.725 --> 01:01:31.101
such as Boggy Creek.

01:01:31.101 --> 01:01:34.560
Possibly in search of food
or more suitable habitat.

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:36.856
Most importantly, once seen,

01:01:36.856 --> 01:01:41.023
it leaves an impression that
is never outrun or forgotten.

01:01:42.076 --> 01:01:43.363
- And after I saw that I kept trying

01:01:43.363 --> 01:01:46.115
to come in touch with the
fact that you're not crazy.

01:01:46.115 --> 01:01:47.703
You saw what you saw.

01:01:47.703 --> 01:01:49.496
And then I took a lot of ridicule

01:01:49.496 --> 01:01:51.583
but my story has never.

01:01:51.583 --> 01:01:53.457
I've told my story to my wife.

01:01:53.457 --> 01:01:56.129
We've been married 34
years, it's never changed.

01:01:56.129 --> 01:01:57.797
And it's never gonna change because it's

01:01:57.797 --> 01:01:59.672
like a little video loop
running through my head.

01:01:59.672 --> 01:02:03.464
I can see the same thing over,
and over, and over again.

01:02:03.464 --> 01:02:05.258
- I saw something.

01:02:05.258 --> 01:02:07.764
I don't know what it was.

01:02:07.764 --> 01:02:10.852
I was a skeptic of Bigfoot until

01:02:10.852 --> 01:02:12.934
I saw what I saw.

01:02:12.934 --> 01:02:14.147
- Ever since I've seen it

01:02:14.147 --> 01:02:16.391
it's become you know, like a,

01:02:16.391 --> 01:02:19.484
I guess kind of like a
under cover secret passion.

01:02:19.484 --> 01:02:20.900
Because it's a mystery.

01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:23.641
And some day, some how somebody's gonna

01:02:23.641 --> 01:02:25.284
find the evidence that we all need

01:02:25.284 --> 01:02:27.117
to prove our saneness.

01:02:28.515 --> 01:02:31.121
- Once you kinda get over the fear

01:02:31.121 --> 01:02:32.454
of the sighting,

01:02:34.492 --> 01:02:37.159
that was very short lived to me.

01:02:38.502 --> 01:02:42.502
What became a much bigger
fear to me was people.

01:02:43.830 --> 01:02:48.227
The reaction, how people
would receive the story,

01:02:48.227 --> 01:02:49.975
what they would think.

01:02:49.975 --> 01:02:52.636
Which is why this is the first time ever

01:02:52.636 --> 01:02:56.229
that I have talked about this event.

01:02:56.229 --> 01:02:58.478
Especially first time I've ever

01:02:58.478 --> 01:03:02.232
brought anybody through the
whole experience on site.

01:03:02.232 --> 01:03:04.358
Though I've told the story to some.

01:03:04.358 --> 01:03:06.987
I've never before today came down

01:03:06.987 --> 01:03:10.325
to the site and walked
anyone through it before.

01:03:10.325 --> 01:03:11.828
And a lot of it had to do
with the fear of people

01:03:11.828 --> 01:03:14.121
way more than the fear of the creature.

01:03:14.121 --> 01:03:16.983
- Yeah, I think that it's becomes

01:03:16.983 --> 01:03:21.139
from something you see in
a movie or on the screen

01:03:21.139 --> 01:03:25.131
later in your life it
translates to a reality.

01:03:25.131 --> 01:03:28.798
And you're in the legend,
you're part of it.

01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:33.761
- Absolutely, the movies
become real life to me.

01:03:33.761 --> 01:03:36.594
Over the years with what I've seen

01:03:37.506 --> 01:03:40.142
and living probably in the heart of

01:03:40.142 --> 01:03:42.559
Bigfoot country in the south,

01:03:43.562 --> 01:03:45.645
it's really come to life.

01:03:46.511 --> 01:03:48.928
And I'm living the movie now.

01:03:53.410 --> 01:03:54.995
- [Lyle] Sightings of
the Boggy Creek monster

01:03:54.995 --> 01:03:56.288
haven't stopped.

01:03:56.288 --> 01:03:59.917
Today the creature seems
more alive than ever.

01:03:59.917 --> 01:04:01.628
While many may have expected the legacy

01:04:01.628 --> 01:04:04.412
of Pierce's movie eventually fade away,

01:04:04.412 --> 01:04:07.317
it lives on as it's
introduced to new generations

01:04:07.317 --> 01:04:10.307
of horror fans and to
those with a curious eye

01:04:10.307 --> 01:04:11.974
for the unexplained.

01:04:13.436 --> 01:04:15.515
While development
encroaches on some of the

01:04:15.515 --> 01:04:17.223
forested areas of Miller County,

01:04:17.223 --> 01:04:19.103
the bottom lands remain much the same

01:04:19.103 --> 01:04:21.185
as they've always been.

01:04:21.185 --> 01:04:22.441
It's here that the creature,

01:04:22.441 --> 01:04:26.570
or the memory of the
creature still resides.

01:04:26.570 --> 01:04:29.750
- I've seen more things happen around here

01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:33.326
in the last 10 years than
I've seen in the past.

01:04:33.326 --> 01:04:36.037
Even though there was a lot of sightings.

01:04:36.037 --> 01:04:37.786
The sightings have never stopped.

01:04:37.786 --> 01:04:39.706
They've been going on for a long time.

01:04:39.706 --> 01:04:42.254
- Since the movie came out a
lot of things have changed.

01:04:42.254 --> 01:04:45.466
One thing, we've become more,

01:04:45.466 --> 01:04:47.133
I don't know burbia.

01:04:48.210 --> 01:04:50.408
It's a lot more advanced
than it used to be.

01:04:50.408 --> 01:04:51.687
Before people would leave their house

01:04:51.687 --> 01:04:53.095
3 o'clock in the morning,

01:04:53.095 --> 01:04:54.655
they didn't come home
until the sun went down

01:04:54.655 --> 01:04:56.136
when they were done working.

01:04:56.136 --> 01:04:57.890
So they were in the woods gathering food

01:04:57.890 --> 01:04:59.933
out of the woods.

01:04:59.933 --> 01:05:02.481
So now people go to town,
they work eight hours,

01:05:02.481 --> 01:05:04.651
they come and flop in
front of the television.

01:05:04.651 --> 01:05:07.401
So the actual amount
of people in the woods

01:05:07.401 --> 01:05:09.608
in my mind has decreased.

01:05:09.608 --> 01:05:12.027
'Cause unless you're a logger,

01:05:12.027 --> 01:05:14.036
you're a farmer, or you're intentionally

01:05:14.036 --> 01:05:15.490
going out here for some reason.

01:05:15.490 --> 01:05:17.785
There's no reason just to show up.

01:05:17.785 --> 01:05:20.291
- The last call that we had come in

01:05:20.291 --> 01:05:22.371
there was a girl from up north

01:05:22.371 --> 01:05:25.543
that was visiting family here in Fouke.

01:05:25.543 --> 01:05:29.005
These two little girls
went riding on the bicycle

01:05:29.005 --> 01:05:33.172
and they was riding one
in front of the other one.

01:05:34.013 --> 01:05:36.099
And the other little girl went on down

01:05:36.099 --> 01:05:37.186
and stopped, turned around,

01:05:37.186 --> 01:05:39.144
and her friend wasn't there.

01:05:39.144 --> 01:05:40.225
She had wrecked out.

01:05:40.225 --> 01:05:41.600
So she drove back and said what happened?

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:45.192
She says, "Right between
us a great big monster

01:05:45.192 --> 01:05:48.902
"just come out of the weeds
and run across in front of us.

01:05:48.902 --> 01:05:49.821
"You didn't see it?"

01:05:49.821 --> 01:05:51.904
She says, "No I just kept
my eyes on the road."

01:05:51.904 --> 01:05:54.659
This little girl was scared to death.

01:05:54.659 --> 01:05:55.784
Now these are little girls

01:05:55.784 --> 01:05:57.655
and this little girl from up north,

01:05:57.655 --> 01:05:59.206
and this was right before I retired.

01:05:59.206 --> 01:06:00.456
Which was 2006.

01:06:03.709 --> 01:06:06.288
- [Lyle] In October of 2000, Stacy Hudson,

01:06:06.288 --> 01:06:08.382
an avid outdoorsman and bow hunter

01:06:08.382 --> 01:06:10.206
encountered the Boggy Creek monster

01:06:10.206 --> 01:06:13.039
in a tree stand early one morning.

01:06:13.973 --> 01:06:18.386
As a result, Stacy's life
was changed dramatically.

01:06:18.386 --> 01:06:19.973
What I've learned from Stacy's sighting

01:06:19.973 --> 01:06:23.098
is that despite the modernization
of southern Arkansas,

01:06:23.098 --> 01:06:24.939
the creature might still call

01:06:24.939 --> 01:06:27.228
the Sulphur River bottoms home.

01:06:27.228 --> 01:06:29.941
- Got to the stand, the
stand was twisted around

01:06:29.941 --> 01:06:33.573
all backwards like something
was messing with it.

01:06:33.573 --> 01:06:34.779
But they didn't steal it.

01:06:34.779 --> 01:06:37.490
It was twisted around so I just got in it

01:06:37.490 --> 01:06:40.076
and straightened it up and climbed in.

01:06:40.076 --> 01:06:41.907
It was a full moon.

01:06:41.907 --> 01:06:44.203
It was probably an hour before daylight

01:06:44.203 --> 01:06:46.483
and I heard something coming up beside me,

01:06:46.483 --> 01:06:48.763
so I just slowly looked over

01:06:48.763 --> 01:06:50.542
and it was two objects.

01:06:50.542 --> 01:06:52.068
Clouds were moving in and out

01:06:52.068 --> 01:06:53.551
so you could see one second

01:06:53.551 --> 01:06:55.339
and then it'd get a little darker.

01:06:55.339 --> 01:06:56.799
But I mean it was close.

01:06:56.799 --> 01:06:58.869
It was probably 15 foot away.

01:06:58.869 --> 01:07:00.189
When they got under me,

01:07:00.189 --> 01:07:01.812
one of them reached up,

01:07:01.812 --> 01:07:04.763
touched the side of my leg, went down,

01:07:04.763 --> 01:07:06.177
I think it grabbed my climbing stand

01:07:06.177 --> 01:07:07.335
and reached up.

01:07:07.335 --> 01:07:08.371
Because I had my bow in my lap,

01:07:08.371 --> 01:07:09.808
my arrow sticking out in front of me.

01:07:09.808 --> 01:07:11.542
He reached up, grabbed my arrow,

01:07:11.542 --> 01:07:15.429
and I guess it cut him
'cause he started hollering.

01:07:15.429 --> 01:07:16.953
And then he just hollered all the way

01:07:16.953 --> 01:07:18.571
down to the bayou.

01:07:18.571 --> 01:07:21.215
Crashed in and then I
heard it cross the creek.

01:07:21.215 --> 01:07:22.832
And I guess I just sat there in shock

01:07:22.832 --> 01:07:24.460
for about 30 minutes
until it got daylight.

01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:28.627
And after that, I didn't bow
hunt for about six years.

01:07:30.503 --> 01:07:32.968
- [Lyle] Today, Fouke is
still a quiet little town

01:07:32.968 --> 01:07:35.255
just off Highway 71.

01:07:35.255 --> 01:07:38.424
A stop gap on the way to
somewhere else for some.

01:07:38.424 --> 01:07:41.061
And a big legend to others.

01:07:41.061 --> 01:07:42.929
The Legend of Boggy Creek has created

01:07:42.929 --> 01:07:46.980
an icon out of what was
once just a local folktale.

01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:49.061
Though there are still those who would

01:07:49.061 --> 01:07:50.649
rather forget the monster,

01:07:50.649 --> 01:07:52.567
for the most part Fouke has adopted

01:07:52.567 --> 01:07:56.196
the creature as their local mascot.

01:07:56.196 --> 01:07:58.072
At the Miller County museum you can

01:07:58.072 --> 01:08:00.490
see the impact the famous legend has had

01:08:00.490 --> 01:08:02.157
on their local culture.

01:08:02.157 --> 01:08:04.708
Then there's the Monster Mart.

01:08:04.708 --> 01:08:07.030
What was once an ordinary
convenience store

01:08:07.030 --> 01:08:09.456
has become something far more.

01:08:09.456 --> 01:08:11.745
Part museum, part souvenir stand,

01:08:11.745 --> 01:08:14.808
the Monster Mart has become
Boggy Creek headquarters

01:08:14.808 --> 01:08:18.006
for monster hunters
from all over the world.

01:08:18.006 --> 01:08:21.081
Clearly Fouke sees a value in the legend.

01:08:21.081 --> 01:08:23.997
(slow paced music)

01:08:27.434 --> 01:08:29.019
- It's part of our heritage here.

01:08:29.019 --> 01:08:31.308
I know some people probably don't like it,

01:08:31.308 --> 01:08:33.442
but some people do.

01:08:33.442 --> 01:08:37.868
But you got that on
anything you talking about.

01:08:37.868 --> 01:08:39.785
That was my main thrush

01:08:41.779 --> 01:08:44.519
was trying to get something
done here in my store.

01:08:44.519 --> 01:08:48.013
And to have something that would be

01:08:48.013 --> 01:08:50.957
more of a heritage type
deal for a community.

01:08:50.957 --> 01:08:53.754
I wanna expand more into museum type items

01:08:53.754 --> 01:08:55.961
and artifacts and stuff that would mean

01:08:55.961 --> 01:09:00.462
something to look at,
something to ponder on.

01:09:00.462 --> 01:09:02.386
- You know Fouke is Fouke.

01:09:02.386 --> 01:09:03.457
Just Fouke.

01:09:03.457 --> 01:09:06.513
But now whenever you talk about Fouke,

01:09:06.513 --> 01:09:07.839
you know, you don't say Miller County,

01:09:07.839 --> 01:09:09.202
it don't ring a bell.

01:09:09.202 --> 01:09:12.519
But you say Boggy Creek or you say Fouke,

01:09:12.519 --> 01:09:14.725
then all of a sudden there's
someone in the crowd,

01:09:14.725 --> 01:09:17.009
more than three is gonna

01:09:17.009 --> 01:09:19.609
know something about it.

01:09:19.609 --> 01:09:21.609
It's brought a lot here.

01:09:22.988 --> 01:09:26.952
- The monster sightings
have brought the attention

01:09:26.952 --> 01:09:30.912
of the world on a little
town and a little creek

01:09:30.912 --> 01:09:33.412
and the area of Miller County.

01:09:35.127 --> 01:09:36.836
- [Lyle] I often ask myself what is it

01:09:36.836 --> 01:09:40.260
about this place that made
the creature settle here.

01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:42.549
It's probably something simple.

01:09:42.549 --> 01:09:44.759
An animal in need of a primitive habitat

01:09:44.759 --> 01:09:46.518
with plenty of food and water.

01:09:46.518 --> 01:09:48.389
And an abundance of cover.

01:09:48.389 --> 01:09:51.310
But maybe, like so many of the locations

01:09:51.310 --> 01:09:53.042
made famous by the movie,

01:09:53.042 --> 01:09:55.543
it just wants to be forgotten.

01:09:56.683 --> 01:09:58.703
The bean field where
those famous three toed

01:09:58.703 --> 01:10:00.984
tracks were found is still there.

01:10:00.984 --> 01:10:03.875
But the Ford house, Herb Jones old shack,

01:10:03.875 --> 01:10:05.736
and even the original General Store

01:10:05.736 --> 01:10:07.821
have all disappeared.

01:10:07.821 --> 01:10:09.320
But if you know where to look,

01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:13.323
you might still catch a
glimpse of the remains.

01:10:13.323 --> 01:10:14.977
Today the Searcy house,

01:10:14.977 --> 01:10:18.298
though featured heavily in
the film, lies abandoned.

01:10:18.298 --> 01:10:20.428
Some of the family that
call this place home

01:10:20.428 --> 01:10:23.009
have long since moved away.

01:10:23.009 --> 01:10:24.972
Many of the witnesses who played a part

01:10:24.972 --> 01:10:26.218
in the creatures story,

01:10:26.218 --> 01:10:30.426
prefer to leave that piece
of their lives behind.

01:10:30.426 --> 01:10:32.331
It's certainly understandable.

01:10:32.331 --> 01:10:35.154
The creature tends to
haunt those it encounters

01:10:35.154 --> 01:10:37.737
long after they've parted ways.

01:10:39.111 --> 01:10:41.275
What is it that continues to bring me back

01:10:41.275 --> 01:10:43.524
year after year to this small town

01:10:43.524 --> 01:10:45.611
and it's rugged wilderness?

01:10:45.611 --> 01:10:47.238
Why do I keep chasing a creature

01:10:47.238 --> 01:10:49.242
that some say it just a myth?

01:10:49.242 --> 01:10:50.992
A folktale, a legend?

01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:54.830
The truth is, I can't stop.

01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:56.706
Like so many of those who've experienced

01:10:56.706 --> 01:10:58.374
the Boggy Creek monster,

01:10:58.374 --> 01:10:59.960
it haunts me.

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:01.584
Not because I've seen it,

01:11:01.584 --> 01:11:04.001
but because I want to see it.

01:11:04.928 --> 01:11:06.470
So I come back to this place

01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:08.470
that first captured my imagination

01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:10.346
all those years ago when it flickered

01:11:10.346 --> 01:11:13.558
to life in The Legend of Boggy Creek.

01:11:13.558 --> 01:11:15.215
I come back because I want to hear

01:11:15.215 --> 01:11:18.512
the creatures mournful cry for myself.

01:11:18.512 --> 01:11:22.658
I come back because I
want to know the truth.

01:11:22.658 --> 01:11:25.575
(slow paced music)

01:11:26.305 --> 01:11:32.631
