00:01.200 --> 00:02.880
   Previously on St Elsewhere...

00:02.880 --> 00:04.800
Let me welcome you to St Eligius.

00:04.800 --> 00:08.800
We unanimously elected you Endicotts
our hospital's first family.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.560
That's the whole point.
You tie the knot,

00:11.560 --> 00:13.160
        have babies, the divine plan.

00:13.160 --> 00:15.400
I want to have a career,
a life of my own.

00:15.400 --> 00:16.440
         Call it a career?

00:16.440 --> 00:19.840
There is recent evidence that
surgery may prolong your life.

00:19.840 --> 00:21.280
                        No operation.

00:21.280 --> 00:22.920
I want my mother to  have surgery.

00:22.920 --> 00:26.920
                 When do you get off?

00:27.320 --> 00:29.000
     My whole life is coming unglued.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.040
  I feel I'm on some weird autopilot.

00:31.040 --> 00:35.040
Whoa, look out!

00:35.160 --> 00:38.720
When you wake up, you'll
be wearing a nice white cast.

00:38.720 --> 00:40.200
   I've got to open up the knee.

00:40.200 --> 00:44.200
I want a second opinion.

02:26.320 --> 02:30.320
           Hiya, pooch.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.160
            Hey, Phil.

02:34.160 --> 02:34.960
Bob, welcome home.

02:34.960 --> 02:36.040
Bob, welcome home.
Thanks.

02:36.040 --> 02:36.960
How are you feeling?

02:36.960 --> 02:38.480
How are you feeling?
Month off does wonders.

02:38.480 --> 02:40.320
I'd like to find out.

02:40.320 --> 02:41.600
Have a good one, huh.

02:41.600 --> 02:45.600
OK. This is gonna hurt.

02:50.600 --> 02:51.920
Hi, Helen.

02:51.920 --> 02:53.920
Bobby. How was Baltimore?

02:53.920 --> 02:55.640
Quiet. Mail for Caldwell.

02:55.640 --> 02:57.400
Sorry  about your friend's mom.

02:57.400 --> 03:00.440
Sounded like a wonderful woman.
It must have been hard.

03:00.440 --> 03:02.960
Yeah, but I got
my head straightened out.

03:02.960 --> 03:06.960
Looking forward to getting back
to work. It's great to be back.

03:13.280 --> 03:14.640
              Elliot.

03:14.640 --> 03:16.640
Dr Caldwell. Good to see you.

03:16.640 --> 03:18.040
Let me get this for you.

03:18.040 --> 03:20.160
Thanks. Anything new since I left?

03:20.160 --> 03:23.040
Well, you can hardly tell
but  the gift shop was blown up.

03:23.040 --> 03:24.920
I just drove 400 miles. Don't kid me.

03:24.920 --> 03:27.240
I'm not.
Phil Chandler was in the explosion.

03:27.240 --> 03:28.760
       He looked fine when I saw him.

03:28.760 --> 03:30.160
But you should see  him jump

03:30.160 --> 03:32.280
when you pop a
paper bag behind his back.

03:32.280 --> 03:33.440
                       Anything else?

03:33.440 --> 03:34.880
Let's see.

03:34.880 --> 03:37.800
Jack slipped on some vomit
and really tore up his knee,

03:37.800 --> 03:41.000
Rosenthal's son's a mess
but Lucy dropped the lawsuit,

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
John Doe finally found out
who he was,

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
and Augusta Endicott is
here with cardiac problems.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.760
Senator, why is it
so important to you

03:50.760 --> 03:54.040
that Mrs Endicott
have the quadruple bypass?

03:54.040 --> 03:57.240
My mother's the heart
and soul of our family.

03:57.240 --> 04:00.000
The rest of us have
  our troubles  and differences,

04:00.000 --> 04:03.840
but around her we're united.
We need my mother at the helm.

04:03.840 --> 04:06.760
Dr Craig says this operation
could prolong her life.

04:06.760 --> 04:09.080
Surgery is probably
the preferred option.

04:09.080 --> 04:11.320
She told me
she didn't want the procedure.

04:11.320 --> 04:14.920
That's because the facts weren't
explained to her in the right light.

04:14.920 --> 04:16.160
           Horse pucky.

04:16.160 --> 04:19.880
Dr Auschlander, St Eligius
needs obvious capital input.

04:19.880 --> 04:22.800
I'd like to pry some
funding loose from Washington.

04:22.800 --> 04:24.040
              I see.

04:24.040 --> 04:25.960
    Buying off the opposition.

04:25.960 --> 04:29.680
Oh, for crying out loud, Daniel.
This isn't Teapot Dome.

04:29.680 --> 04:33.680
Mrs Endicott can have  the bypass
 or be managed with medication.

04:33.680 --> 04:36.400
But what have we got to lose
   by encouraging surgery,

04:36.400 --> 04:38.440
if it'll benefit the hospital?

04:38.440 --> 04:40.840
Santa Claus died,
    we got rid of the Valeres,

04:40.840 --> 04:44.600
Wayne got engaged but
that ended when his sperm
    got put into a stranger,

04:44.600 --> 04:47.040
I took care of a gorilla
     but lost her anyway.

04:47.040 --> 04:48.080
           The gorilla?

04:48.080 --> 04:49.280
No, the keeper.

04:49.280 --> 04:53.240
My mother told me what happened
between you and my father.

04:53.240 --> 04:56.640
I'd like to make up for his
unfortunate slur on your heritage.

04:56.640 --> 04:58.520
Necktie, Michael.

04:58.520 --> 05:01.240
Oh, right, the tie's the image.

05:01.240 --> 05:04.040
Judge McGuinness is
in saying hello to Grandmother,

05:04.040 --> 05:06.280
Aunt Maggie and Uncle Gareth
are on their way,

05:06.280 --> 05:07.640
  Patricia's due this afternoon,

05:07.640 --> 05:10.600
everyone else is in the conference
room. And Mom called.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.200
Your mother should be here.

05:12.200 --> 05:15.840
Yep, she's in Africa
and you're divorced.

05:15.840 --> 05:18.920
You know, Mom saw an elephant
give birth? Incredible, huh?

05:18.920 --> 05:22.920
Come on, Michael,
let's go for a walk.

05:23.160 --> 05:25.560
Look, I may be wrong
about the surgery.

05:25.560 --> 05:28.960
As soon as everybody gets here,
I'll canvas my entire family.

05:28.960 --> 05:32.960
I'll abide by their decision,
and Mother will, too.

05:34.120 --> 05:36.880
Boy,  Daniel,
you really pick at a scab.

05:36.880 --> 05:39.280
Old man Endicott
circumcised you  40 years ago

05:39.280 --> 05:43.280
and you are still
kicking dirt on his grave.

05:43.920 --> 05:45.680
   You know something, Michael?

05:45.680 --> 05:47.360
          You're a dork.

05:47.360 --> 05:50.040
Chandler, you're looking beat.
How far d'you go?

05:50.040 --> 05:52.240
Two blocks.
Couldn't get it up today.

05:52.240 --> 05:54.480
My brother, Michael.
This is Dr Chandler.

05:54.480 --> 05:57.960
Phil and I have puked on each other's
shoes in a couple of marathons.

05:57.960 --> 05:59.360
Michael.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.800
I met Dr Wade today
in my grandmother's room.

06:01.800 --> 06:05.160
Is she into the making
of a president's son?

06:05.160 --> 06:08.040
Dr Ehrlich, this last
patient is yours, I believe.

06:08.040 --> 06:10.920
Yes, sir. White female, 32,
admitted for hysterectomy

06:10.920 --> 06:13.200
for intractable pain
       from endometriosis.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.240
THBSO were performed two days ago.

06:15.240 --> 06:19.240
Patient is afebrile and doing well.

06:30.360 --> 06:34.360
(TANNOY) Dr Scotland, OR 2.
Dr Scotland, OR 2.

06:37.440 --> 06:40.080
Helen, did you see
which way rounds went?

06:40.080 --> 06:42.200
Dr Barton's or Dr Meldrum's?

06:42.200 --> 06:43.240
          Dr Westphall's.

06:43.240 --> 06:45.600
Sorry.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.600
Boomer. I was just looking for you.

06:47.600 --> 06:49.520
I thought you were on rounds.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.400
          Lost them in the stairwell.

06:51.400 --> 06:54.440
When I pick Pete up do I bring him
here or take him to my place?

06:54.440 --> 06:57.160
Oh, also, I  need some money
for his class photo.

06:57.160 --> 06:58.600
       Your place. Backpack.

06:58.600 --> 07:01.160
Why don't you take
     time off to recuperate?

07:01.160 --> 07:02.480
How will you keep this up?

07:02.480 --> 07:04.160
No sympathy for sick residents.

07:04.160 --> 07:08.160
I'll get it.

07:10.640 --> 07:11.840
Want some coffee?

07:11.840 --> 07:15.840
               Yeah.

07:18.240 --> 07:20.200
Seems like only yesterday.

07:20.200 --> 07:22.920
That's when this was made.

07:22.920 --> 07:25.440
You used to get up,
put on one of my shirts.

07:25.440 --> 07:27.320
After I'd sniffed the pits.

07:27.320 --> 07:30.520
Then you'd bring my coffee,
come back to bed and then we'd...

07:30.520 --> 07:32.160
Boomer.

07:32.160 --> 07:35.320
Old days.  Histoire.

07:35.320 --> 07:38.640
I sure miss them.
I can't stop thinking about you,

07:38.640 --> 07:40.560
dream about being together.

07:40.560 --> 07:41.760
Don't do it. Don't say...

07:41.760 --> 07:43.960
Don't do it. Don't say...
            I love you.

07:43.960 --> 07:46.200
We've been through this.
Friends, that's all.

07:46.200 --> 07:50.200
Please, not the hurt puppy look.
It's not gonna work.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.600
It's working. Boomer, stop.

07:54.600 --> 07:58.600
Pathos is not love.

07:58.600 --> 08:02.080
Well, I...

08:02.080 --> 08:04.400
Well, no, no. It's just...

08:04.400 --> 08:06.560
OK, I've been...

08:06.560 --> 08:09.080
thinking about my birthday tomorrow.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.320
Mm-hm.

08:10.320 --> 08:12.200
Last year you and I were together and

08:12.200 --> 08:16.200
it was only the best birthday
I've had since I was three.

08:17.080 --> 08:20.520
    I got a Fanner 50 cap gun.

08:20.520 --> 08:24.520
OK, I'll throw you a birthday party,
right here in hospital.

08:24.760 --> 08:26.400
        I don't like cake.

08:26.400 --> 08:30.280
I know. I remember. Boysenberry
pie just like Momma used to buy.

08:30.280 --> 08:34.280
You're weird, Boomer.
I'm gonna go make arrangements.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.760
So what do you want
for your birthday?

08:36.760 --> 08:38.080
         Knitting needles.

08:38.080 --> 08:39.400
How darling.

08:39.400 --> 08:41.840
 Yeah, everybody keeps stealing mine.

08:41.840 --> 08:43.520
 It's the only way I can reach it.

08:43.520 --> 08:44.960
Bye, Boomer.

08:44.960 --> 08:48.720
# You're on the road to nowhere
Doo-doo-doo

08:48.720 --> 08:51.800
       # Come on inside, joo

08:51.800 --> 08:55.800
   # Taking that ride to nowhere

08:55.880 --> 08:59.080
    # We'll take that ride... #

08:59.080 --> 09:02.280
Michael.

09:02.280 --> 09:03.600
                       Talking Heads.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.000
Where?

09:05.000 --> 09:08.680
David Byrne. Don't you remember, I
played the album for you last week?

09:08.680 --> 09:10.880
Ah, yes.

09:10.880 --> 09:13.280
Where's your father?

09:13.280 --> 09:16.920
                  Uh, news interview.

09:16.920 --> 09:19.080
Can you be a little more specific?

09:19.080 --> 09:21.080
Interview about what?

09:21.080 --> 09:23.760
I don't know it.
I'm not really into what he thinks.

09:23.760 --> 09:25.600
I see.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.600
 Well, he's not into what I think.

09:27.600 --> 09:31.200
When he's running for president,
you'll be out campaigning for him.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.200
What if somebody better's
running against him?

09:33.200 --> 09:35.080
What if somebody better's
running against him?
There won't be.

09:35.080 --> 09:38.760
 Ooh, my Endicott right or wrong.

09:38.760 --> 09:40.960
You'd do well
     to emulate your father,

09:40.960 --> 09:44.960
if for no other reason
than to prepare for your
     time in public service.

09:45.240 --> 09:47.640
 Oh, no, no. That's Dougie's bag.

09:47.640 --> 09:51.080
You're more like him than Douglas.

09:51.080 --> 09:54.480
    And I thought you loved me.

09:54.480 --> 09:55.760
You know I do.

09:55.760 --> 09:59.320
          And you, Gram,

09:59.320 --> 10:02.000
are the only one I care
about in our whole tribe.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.320
What happens when
I'm not here any more?

10:04.320 --> 10:07.080
I'll go dog-sled
racing in the Arctic.

10:07.080 --> 10:10.280
You've got to figure out what  you're
going to do with your life.

10:10.280 --> 10:14.280
              Ah, but I already know.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.480
Mother.

10:15.480 --> 10:18.040
Oh, Maggie. Gareth.

10:18.040 --> 10:20.800
I'm here now.
Everything's gonna be OK.

10:20.800 --> 10:22.800
Michael, dear, give Auntie a kiss.

10:22.800 --> 10:25.640
                I'd rather be maimed.

10:25.640 --> 10:29.640
Oh, see you. Hey, Uncle Gareth.

10:30.600 --> 10:31.680
             Dr Craig.

10:31.680 --> 10:35.360
I have a consult before meeting with
the Endicott family. See me later.

10:35.360 --> 10:37.360
 This is about Mrs Endicott, sir.

10:37.360 --> 10:39.440
Her latest EKG show any problems?

10:39.440 --> 10:41.360
No, it's not related to the ischemia.

10:41.360 --> 10:42.920
Well, talk fast.

10:42.920 --> 10:45.440
Have you noticed any
enlargement of her liver?

10:45.440 --> 10:46.480
And if I had?

10:46.480 --> 10:50.480
I took the liberty of ordering liver
tests. They indicate early cirrhosis.

10:50.520 --> 10:54.400
Is this your way of telling me
that Mrs Endicott is a secret lush?

10:54.400 --> 10:57.560
Sir, I rechecked her chart.
She's also mildly diabetic

10:57.560 --> 11:00.560
and her serum iron is off the scale.
That could mean...

11:00.560 --> 11:03.320
I know what it could mean, damn it.

11:03.320 --> 11:05.600
Why didn't you tell
me about this sooner?

11:05.600 --> 11:07.280
Went to a farm to sort my life out.

11:07.280 --> 11:10.040
Started at the bottom,
cleaning out the cattle pens.

11:10.040 --> 11:11.920
  Granted, I got my perspective back.

11:11.920 --> 11:14.840
Kind of peace of mind I thought
I'd get in Ethiopia.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.360
Want to sort the face,
get the scar taken care of.

11:17.360 --> 11:18.880
   Gonna need a couple of days.

11:18.880 --> 11:21.840
That's fine. Tell you the truth,
it could use some work.

11:21.840 --> 11:22.480
               Ouch.

11:22.480 --> 11:23.520
               Ouch.
You OK?

11:23.520 --> 11:27.200
Yeah. Hurt myself up at the farm,
got infected. Hurts like hell.

11:27.200 --> 11:28.560
Get that taken  care of.

11:28.560 --> 11:31.240
               Yeah.

11:31.240 --> 11:32.320
Hi.

11:32.320 --> 11:33.400
Hi.

11:33.400 --> 11:34.480
How's Geoff doing?

11:34.480 --> 11:36.280
You'll have to ask his commandant.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.440
He looks so good in
khaki and epaulettes.

11:38.440 --> 11:40.440
You put him in a military school?

11:40.440 --> 11:44.200
He's protecting the Falmouth  coast
from enemy attack.

11:44.200 --> 11:48.200
What the hell is that?

11:50.480 --> 11:52.000
    Seen turkeys trust better.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.840
Yeah, well, I've been meaning
  to drive on up to the Cape

11:54.840 --> 11:57.400
and  sugar the fuel tank
in his Cessna.

11:57.400 --> 12:00.160
 Well, it's amenable to revision.

12:00.160 --> 12:03.640
We excise the scar tissue,
pull the skin tight,

12:03.640 --> 12:05.520
 you wink funny for a week or two.

12:05.520 --> 12:08.560
You know, Harper,
I carried you through residency.

12:08.560 --> 12:12.560
That's because I knew you
were the best...after me.

12:12.600 --> 12:16.600
Well, that may be, but I've got it
all over you in style.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.600
  You ever think of coming to BG?

12:19.600 --> 12:21.160
And work under you?

12:21.160 --> 12:23.320
What would I want to do that for?

12:23.320 --> 12:25.880
Better skirt than
the dog pound you work in.

12:25.880 --> 12:29.280
I'm doing medicine there you
reflector heads haven't dreamed of.

12:29.280 --> 12:31.200
              Right.

12:31.200 --> 12:33.800
Here's is the programme.
You come in next week,

12:33.800 --> 12:37.040
we remove the zipper, restore
you to your original ugliness.

12:37.040 --> 12:39.280
Fine. What's the price?

12:39.280 --> 12:42.040
          Seven figures.

12:42.040 --> 12:43.960
Some professional courtesy.

12:43.960 --> 12:45.600
           Phone number.

12:45.600 --> 12:48.760
Those twins you were with
at Foley's a few months ago.

12:48.760 --> 12:51.280
You got it.

12:51.280 --> 12:54.880
Oh, and I don't want a transfusion
from your local stock here.

12:54.880 --> 12:58.320
Bobby, we're talking
simple facial surgery here.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.000
  We're not gonna snag an artery.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.120
You won't get
contaminated blood.

13:02.120 --> 13:05.040
All the same, I'd like to leave
 a couple of units with you

13:05.040 --> 13:06.760
just to be on the safe side.

13:06.760 --> 13:07.880
Fine.

13:07.880 --> 13:10.600
Whip off a pint now.
I'll take it down the blood bank.

13:10.600 --> 13:14.600
Fine. I see you've got this
thing set on the wuss setting.

13:15.880 --> 13:19.520
Mother will live a longer, higher
quality life after this surgery.

13:19.520 --> 13:21.600
I'm not disagreeing
with you, Gordon.

13:21.600 --> 13:24.200
The problem is convincing
her to accept the risk.

13:24.200 --> 13:27.640
Aunt Maggie, Uncle Gordon, just
don't badger her into a decision.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.320
Concentrate on having
your baby, Sarah, dear.

13:30.320 --> 13:32.080
Leave this  to the grown-ups, huh?

13:32.080 --> 13:33.280
       Anybody seen Michael?

13:33.280 --> 13:34.320
Not lately, sir.

13:34.320 --> 13:35.880
   We must allay Mother's fears.

13:35.880 --> 13:37.480
Mother is not afraid.

13:37.480 --> 13:40.040
And fear is a cardinal sin
in your book, isn't it?

13:40.040 --> 13:41.960
We're all so afraid of being afraid.

13:41.960 --> 13:43.760
That's why Franklin took his life.

13:43.760 --> 13:46.760
His only escape. There was no
other way out of this family.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.880
Yours never dropped, Gordon.

13:48.880 --> 13:50.360
Hello, Senator.

13:50.360 --> 13:52.440
Ready to meet the
whole clan, Dr Craig?

13:52.440 --> 13:55.800
Yes, but first you should  know
  we've uncovered something else

13:55.800 --> 13:59.160
about your mother's health
apart from the heart disease.

13:59.160 --> 14:03.080
Tests seem to indicate that she has
the symptoms of haemochromatosis,

14:03.080 --> 14:07.080
a relatively rare disorder
characterised by excess of

14:07.320 --> 14:09.040
iron accumulation in the body.

14:09.040 --> 14:10.360
        Is that dangerous?

14:10.360 --> 14:12.880
Yes, without careful control.

14:12.880 --> 14:15.440
However, judging from the history,

14:15.440 --> 14:18.200
her condition appears
      to be inherited,

14:18.200 --> 14:20.160
and that trait is passed on.

14:20.160 --> 14:24.160
All of you are potentially
carrying the disease.

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
     Let's show in the family.

14:34.440 --> 14:38.440
        All right, OK. Bye.

14:38.800 --> 14:39.920
Wayne.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.680
Don't look at me. Ehrlich
stole Jack's knitting needles.

14:42.680 --> 14:45.560
I need help. I'm throwing a party
for Boomer. Spread the word.

14:45.560 --> 14:48.080
I can spread it.
I don't know if anyone will bite.

14:48.080 --> 14:50.920
Please. It'll kill him
if I don't come through now.

14:50.920 --> 14:53.040
All right.
The thing I don't understand

14:53.040 --> 14:55.320
is why you keep
going out of your way for Jack.

14:55.320 --> 14:56.840
Makes me feel better.

14:56.840 --> 14:58.280
About breaking up with him?

14:58.280 --> 15:00.720
No, about being turned
on by one of his friends.

15:00.720 --> 15:02.320
               Who?

15:02.320 --> 15:04.240
I enjoyed going  out the other night.

15:04.240 --> 15:06.400
        Oh, wait a second.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.840
We just had pepperoni
and mushroom with Pete.

15:08.840 --> 15:10.840
Yeah, but more
importantly, we had fun.

15:10.840 --> 15:13.360
We enjoy the same things,
have similar natures.

15:13.360 --> 15:14.480
           Yeah, but...

15:14.480 --> 15:16.040
I know.  I'm as surprised as you,

15:16.040 --> 15:19.640
but I can't stop thinking about you,
dreaming about being together.

15:19.640 --> 15:21.840
 But since then I'm engaged again.

15:21.840 --> 15:25.840
Or I will be as soon as a
patch things up with Mona.

15:26.080 --> 15:27.640
OK.

15:27.640 --> 15:31.640
Still time to have a V8.

15:35.480 --> 15:38.080
    Did you use polythene, Pam?

15:38.080 --> 15:41.320
OK, Mr Lennox, tell me about
the tingling in your toes.

15:41.320 --> 15:44.800
I had a frostbite once when
I lived in the Rockies in Colorado.

15:44.800 --> 15:46.240
       I was in advertising.

15:46.240 --> 15:49.360
"Be bolder.
Build a better Bolder."

15:49.360 --> 15:51.360
          That was mine.

15:51.360 --> 15:53.640
OK. Will you feel this?

15:53.640 --> 15:56.080
        Agh! You feel that?

15:56.080 --> 15:57.120
Ow!

15:57.120 --> 16:01.120
Yes and it hurt.
Thank you very much!

16:01.880 --> 16:05.360
I heard on TV you got
the Endicott dame here.

16:05.360 --> 16:07.160
                      All that money.

16:07.160 --> 16:09.640
Always making
donations to big causes.

16:09.640 --> 16:12.880
Yet the family never pays
the cheque in a restaurant.

16:12.880 --> 16:15.680
             Like everyone owes them.

16:15.680 --> 16:18.880
My cousin had a diner,
Flo and Eddie's.

16:18.880 --> 16:22.880
They barely made a living as
it was without getting stiffed.

16:27.640 --> 16:30.120
Uh, let's just assume for today

16:30.120 --> 16:33.560
your reflexes are fine and
  you  have feeling in that foot.

16:33.560 --> 16:37.560
I was sitting in Angelo's
in '79 when I heard the good news.

16:38.240 --> 16:41.600
     The oldest son. What's his name?

16:41.600 --> 16:43.120
                        Oh, Franklin.

16:43.120 --> 16:46.840
Franklin took a Roman holiday
and twin-bladed his wrists.

16:46.840 --> 16:50.840
He's got Fort Knox as a trust fund
and he uses a 49-cent razor.

16:53.120 --> 16:55.080
                      It made my day.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.520
I bought everyone in the bar a round.

16:57.520 --> 17:01.520
          Nobody knew why, except me.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
                         And now you.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.359
Mr Lennox, um,

17:07.359 --> 17:10.760
I've got to
draw blood for a glucose test.

17:10.760 --> 17:13.760
                 Over your dead body.

17:13.760 --> 17:16.280
    I got a business to take care of.

17:16.280 --> 17:20.280
No problem. Your choice.
Come back whenever you want.

17:24.319 --> 17:28.319
You ever wonder why it's always you?

17:48.840 --> 17:50.200
Wayne!

17:50.200 --> 17:52.040
You were in the shower for ever.

17:52.040 --> 17:53.360
What are you doing?!

17:53.360 --> 17:56.200
This is the only way I can
get a chance to talk to you

17:56.200 --> 17:58.400
and see what I've been missing.

17:58.400 --> 17:59.520
Get out.

17:59.520 --> 18:02.400
Mona. I was wrong about  trying to
push up the wedding date

18:02.400 --> 18:05.400
and press you into motherhood.
I'm sorry. I want you back.

18:05.400 --> 18:06.800
            Look at our relationship.

18:06.800 --> 18:09.240
It's a merry-go-round
without the gold ring.

18:09.240 --> 18:12.560
     We go from argument to argument.

18:12.560 --> 18:13.680
Mona, I love you.

18:13.680 --> 18:17.160
I can't stop thinking about you
and dreaming about being together.

18:17.160 --> 18:19.040
      I don't think we're compatible.

18:19.040 --> 18:21.760
You kidding?
Your software, my hardware.

18:21.760 --> 18:23.560
                      See you, Wayne.

18:23.560 --> 18:26.960
Mona, wait. At least let me invite
you to Jack's birthday party.

18:26.960 --> 18:29.960
Tomorrow on the third
floor, nurses' lounge.

18:29.960 --> 18:33.480
Great. I'll see you there.

18:33.480 --> 18:34.920
You're invited too.

18:34.920 --> 18:38.920
Fiscus, get out of here.

18:41.440 --> 18:43.840
                              Gordon.

18:43.840 --> 18:47.240
Have your office send a family
photo to the kitchen staff.

18:47.240 --> 18:50.920
They have duplicated
my flan recipe to perfection.

18:50.920 --> 18:52.360
We had it brought in.

18:52.360 --> 18:55.720
                                  Oh.

18:55.720 --> 18:57.840
Mother, the family
held a summit today.

18:57.840 --> 19:00.480
                   Really? Who lived?

19:00.480 --> 19:04.480
The bypass is in your best interests
and Dr Craig is with us on this.

19:04.480 --> 19:06.520
You told me the
decision was up to me.

19:06.520 --> 19:10.520
It still is,
but there's  room to reconsider.

19:10.560 --> 19:12.840
I've accomplished
all that's necessary

19:12.840 --> 19:15.080
as a wife, a mother
and a grandmother.

19:15.080 --> 19:17.600
Let me live out my life
as a woman in one piece.

19:17.600 --> 19:18.960
Do you want to quit?

19:18.960 --> 19:22.160
        Bow out gracefully.

19:22.160 --> 19:26.160
I can't play to the image any longer.

19:28.880 --> 19:29.920
         I'm tired, dear.

19:29.920 --> 19:32.280
So am I.

19:32.280 --> 19:35.160
I'd rather be with my sons
out sailing, but I can't.

19:35.160 --> 19:37.240
Father wanted a son
       in the White House,

19:37.240 --> 19:39.880
and when Franklin
couldn't handle the pressure,

19:39.880 --> 19:43.880
I inherited the burden from him.

19:44.080 --> 19:46.960
All of us have ultimately
    had to surrender

19:46.960 --> 19:50.960
our personal  desires
     to the family's wishes.

19:51.360 --> 19:53.080
Excuse me.

19:53.080 --> 19:56.840
Stay, Dr Craig.

19:56.840 --> 19:58.640
Mother, we have at our disposal

19:58.640 --> 20:02.640
the  medical technology
    to keep you with this us.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.000
You don't have to die.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.160
It isn't 1936.

20:06.160 --> 20:10.160
        How I wish it were.

20:12.520 --> 20:16.040
     I was pregnant with you.

20:16.040 --> 20:20.040
Franklin and Maggie already knew
how to manipulate the nanny...

20:24.160 --> 20:26.920
..and Richard
came down with pleurisy.

20:26.920 --> 20:30.920
I sat by his bed night after night,
watching him slip away.

20:31.560 --> 20:35.560
It's the first time I both doubted
my faith in God and reaffirmed it.

20:37.280 --> 20:41.280
 I promised him then always to...

20:46.560 --> 20:48.680
Dr Craig,

20:48.680 --> 20:50.480
my son is right.

20:50.480 --> 20:54.480
I was being selfish.

20:55.040 --> 20:59.040
You may operate.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.400
                Yo.

21:04.400 --> 21:05.440
Bobby.

21:05.440 --> 21:08.000
Harper. Look,
I left my address book at home.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.480
Besides, I won't give you the number
until after I see your work.

21:11.480 --> 21:12.520
Right.

21:12.520 --> 21:14.600
            What's up?

21:14.600 --> 21:16.000
How about dinner?

21:16.000 --> 21:19.760
Are you crazy? I've got crap
a mile thick around here.

21:19.760 --> 21:21.360
We ought to talk.

21:21.360 --> 21:25.360
                      Fine. Sit down.

21:29.720 --> 21:32.480
Bobby, the blood bank
called a little while ago.

21:32.480 --> 21:35.040
They ran a routine panel
on  that pint of blood.

21:35.040 --> 21:39.040
The T-cell count was off and there
was presence of HTLV-3 antibodies.

21:41.120 --> 21:42.680
            Not funny.

21:42.680 --> 21:45.840
It's not a joke.

21:45.840 --> 21:47.040
How you been feeling?

21:47.040 --> 21:48.960
               Fine.

21:48.960 --> 21:51.120
       Healthy as all hell.

21:51.120 --> 21:54.080
I've been pitching bales of
alfalfa for the past month.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.400
Gotta be some SNAFU
at you institution.

21:56.400 --> 21:58.240
No, I checked the tests.

21:58.240 --> 21:59.280
              Duncan.

21:59.280 --> 22:01.720
I checked the tests, Bobby.

22:01.720 --> 22:05.720
Positive HTLV-3 antibodies.

22:17.200 --> 22:20.880
Have you found any lesions?

22:20.880 --> 22:23.560
Bobby?

22:23.560 --> 22:25.560
 Look, you say I've got the virus.

22:25.560 --> 22:27.080
    That doesn't mean anything.

22:27.080 --> 22:29.040
Odds are the disease won't manifest.

22:29.040 --> 22:32.160
Bobby,  we don't know
what the odds are.

22:32.160 --> 22:34.880
You're a doctor.
You're supposed to be an optimist.

22:34.880 --> 22:38.880
Then you haven't noticed anything?

22:42.720 --> 22:46.520
  I thought it was an infection.

22:46.520 --> 22:50.520
          I've got AIDS?

22:56.400 --> 22:57.760
You're absolutely sure?

22:57.760 --> 23:01.760
Double checked the blood panel,
ran a biopsy on the sarcoma.

23:02.640 --> 23:06.240
Look, Bob, they're bearing down
on this virus more every day.

23:06.240 --> 23:08.440
There could be a breakthrough.

23:08.440 --> 23:09.760
You really believe that?

23:09.760 --> 23:11.720
I do.
We'll get on top of this thing.

23:11.720 --> 23:12.760
          Yeah, in time.

23:12.760 --> 23:15.240
Right now I'm trying to
make myself understand

23:15.240 --> 23:18.000
that I have about 15 months to live.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.280
           But I can't.

23:20.280 --> 23:22.640
    It just doesn't make sense.

23:22.640 --> 23:24.640
All my life I've been taught to win.

23:24.640 --> 23:28.240
There's no way
that the clock's run out.

23:28.240 --> 23:31.240
What do you want to do?

23:31.240 --> 23:33.720
Hell, I don't
want to just roll over and die.

23:33.720 --> 23:35.840
I don't even want to think about it.

23:35.840 --> 23:39.840
 I'm putting myself on treatments.

23:40.040 --> 23:42.840
    And I want to keep working.

23:42.840 --> 23:46.760
I can't even count the number of
women I've rolled in clover with.

23:46.760 --> 23:48.520
When I got lonely, I went looking,

23:48.520 --> 23:50.880
    and when I found something,

23:50.880 --> 23:54.560
 could have been a lot of people.

23:54.560 --> 23:58.560
       Maybe I deserve this.

24:06.200 --> 24:10.200
I'm afraid visitors
are not allowed beyond this point.

24:11.280 --> 24:15.280
Sarah, I expect you to take good
care of my first great-grandchild.

24:15.960 --> 24:18.920
Baby and I'll spend lots of  time
 with you when you're better.

24:18.920 --> 24:22.920
Your father was my first-born.

24:25.480 --> 24:28.440
You can't give them too much love.

24:28.440 --> 24:29.720
You'll be fine, Mother.

24:29.720 --> 24:33.720
That's in God's
      and  Dr Craig's hands.

24:33.920 --> 24:36.440
We'll see you in a few hours.

24:36.440 --> 24:39.880
Gordon, talk to Michael.

24:39.880 --> 24:41.360
Don't shut your son out.

24:41.360 --> 24:45.360
      Let's get her into OR.

25:04.960 --> 25:06.080
You having trouble?

25:06.080 --> 25:07.680
Oh, no. Just every time I go in.

25:07.680 --> 25:10.600
Let me help you. Here.

25:10.600 --> 25:14.600
Isolation.
It's got to be my patient, right?

25:14.640 --> 25:16.040
I hear it's your birthday.

25:16.040 --> 25:16.360
Yep.

25:16.360 --> 25:17.480
Yep.
Congratulations.

25:17.480 --> 25:18.520
Thank you.

25:18.520 --> 25:20.320
 You doing anything to celebrate?

25:20.320 --> 25:21.680
Yeah, there's a party.

25:21.680 --> 25:23.760
Oh, I know. I meant tonight.

25:23.760 --> 25:26.520
Um, no.

25:26.520 --> 25:30.160
Well, how about letting me
take you out to dinner?

25:30.160 --> 25:34.080
What... You....
Why, do you mean just you and me?

25:34.080 --> 25:36.040
What about the...Wayne?

25:36.040 --> 25:38.360
  I returned the engagement ring.

25:38.360 --> 25:41.400
Besides, it's more fun just
you and me, don't you think?

25:41.400 --> 25:43.440
Um...  I don't...

25:43.440 --> 25:45.720
Well... See, I'm not sure.

25:45.720 --> 25:48.520
The hardest thing
about deciding to marry Wayne

25:48.520 --> 25:49.920
was forgetting about you.

25:49.920 --> 25:52.040
We don't even know
each other that...

25:52.040 --> 25:56.040
I know you don't know me,
but I've been watching you a lot

25:57.280 --> 26:01.120
and I can't stop thinking about you,
dreaming about being together.

26:01.120 --> 26:04.320
Oh.  Well, I never noticed.

26:04.320 --> 26:05.480
I...

26:05.480 --> 26:07.440
I think you're nice.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.320
Um...

26:09.320 --> 26:11.880
Well, this is really a surprise.

26:11.880 --> 26:15.880
The offer's open, Jack, any time.

26:15.960 --> 26:19.960
Happy birthday.

26:23.920 --> 26:26.480
Did you see what my dumb bunny
of a brother did?

26:26.480 --> 26:29.560
Anything to keep from
shaking hands on the campaign trail.

26:29.560 --> 26:31.760
The hose deserved it.

26:31.760 --> 26:34.600
This disease gonna
get in the way of my running?

26:34.600 --> 26:37.120
If we watch it  early,
    it shouldn't be limiting.

26:37.120 --> 26:38.920
That's why we test all of you.

26:38.920 --> 26:40.000
          And then what?

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
Those with high serum iron
   will give blood  periodically
   to remove the excess.

26:44.160 --> 26:45.480
For how long?

26:45.480 --> 26:46.600
As long as it takes.

26:46.600 --> 26:48.160
You're next.

26:48.160 --> 26:50.520
I don't want to know.

26:50.520 --> 26:51.920
Get off it, Sarah.

26:51.920 --> 26:53.720
Oh, sure, you don't care.

26:53.720 --> 26:56.320
It's just another trial
           by  fire you can overcome.

26:56.320 --> 26:59.360
You just love a contest.
I have a baby on the way.

26:59.360 --> 27:02.440
Well, pregnancy depletes iron.

27:02.440 --> 27:05.360
Women who bear children rarely
manifest the disorder

27:05.360 --> 27:09.360
till much later in life, but we want
to test you just to be sure.

27:10.600 --> 27:13.280
I hate the thought of
       my  baby growing up with this.

27:13.280 --> 27:15.160
The family curse.

27:15.160 --> 27:17.560
Dues time, pay with our own blood.

27:17.560 --> 27:19.920
You know Grandpa made
a pact with the devil.

27:19.920 --> 27:23.560
Satan gives us everything
and God takes it away,

27:23.560 --> 27:25.640
and your kid's gonna be more fodder.

27:25.640 --> 27:28.520
         Shut up, Michael.

27:28.520 --> 27:31.800
Hold my hand.

27:31.800 --> 27:35.040
Just relax.

27:35.040 --> 27:37.200
    Bob wants to keep his job.

27:37.200 --> 27:39.800
Should we allow that?

27:39.800 --> 27:41.080
        How can we stop it?

27:41.080 --> 27:43.680
But the risk to patients
and staff being exposed.

27:43.680 --> 27:46.240
We're in brand new
territory here, Daniel.

27:46.240 --> 27:48.160
No-one knows how this virus behaves.

27:48.160 --> 27:50.560
Yes,  that's sufficient reason
  for alarm.

27:50.560 --> 27:53.160
Besides, the public's
scared half to death.

27:53.160 --> 27:55.200
If they find out
     a doctor here has AIDS,

27:55.200 --> 27:56.920
there won't be a  patient left.

27:56.920 --> 27:58.040
            I knew it.

27:58.040 --> 27:59.600
  Scares the hell out of me, too.

27:59.600 --> 28:02.880
Some people say the only way
we're gonna stop it from spreading

28:02.880 --> 28:05.920
is to round up all the potential
carriers and isolate them,

28:05.920 --> 28:07.720
and we don't have a system for that.

28:07.720 --> 28:11.720
Society would have to change its
whole concept of individual freedom.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.520
Listen to us,
worrying about this hospital

28:14.520 --> 28:17.880
when this young man
just found out he's gonna die.

28:17.880 --> 28:19.960
We have to worry about the hospital.

28:19.960 --> 28:23.280
What if they asked you to quit
because of your liver cancer?

28:23.280 --> 28:26.800
People have tried.

28:26.800 --> 28:29.560
The man sat there in my office
not knowing what hit him

28:29.560 --> 28:33.560
and I kept thinking,
"Thank God it's not me."

28:38.520 --> 28:42.320
        BP is 106 over 62.

28:42.320 --> 28:45.120
I'm ready to unclamp the cannula
and go to the pump.

28:45.120 --> 28:46.200
Hold it.

28:46.200 --> 28:50.200
What d'you mean, hold it?

28:53.520 --> 28:55.720
Ready.

28:55.720 --> 28:58.760
Here we go.

28:58.760 --> 29:02.680
Mrs Endicott's blood will be
filtered and perfused with oxygen.

29:02.680 --> 29:05.440
She'll be totally dependent
upon modern technology

29:05.440 --> 29:09.440
for cardiopulmonary function.

29:09.680 --> 29:10.760
(HE SNEEZES)

29:10.760 --> 29:13.320
Oh, put a muzzle on it.

29:13.320 --> 29:17.320
Clamping the ascending aorta.

29:26.520 --> 29:28.920
Stop the heart.

29:28.920 --> 29:30.520
Cardioplegia solution.

29:30.520 --> 29:34.120
What is it about the Endicott family
that captures our imaginations?

29:34.120 --> 29:36.520
The American Dream, Wade.

29:36.520 --> 29:40.000
Came into this country penniless
and built an industrial empire.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.960
Mrs Endicott's husband  counselled
every president since Coolidge

29:43.960 --> 29:47.960
and now his son  may be
   our next commander in chief.

29:48.200 --> 29:51.120
The first thing Americans
   missed after the revolution

29:51.120 --> 29:53.920
was royalty, a ruling dynasty.

29:53.920 --> 29:56.880
Searched for it ever since.
Endicotts fit the bill.

29:56.880 --> 29:58.680
They're famous for being famous.

29:58.680 --> 30:02.680
They're people of deeds,
not just  words. Where do we stand?

30:02.840 --> 30:05.200
  She's totally on the machines.

30:05.200 --> 30:06.760
          Perfusing well.

30:06.760 --> 30:10.240
    Main arterial pressure 75.

30:10.240 --> 30:12.080
Sound like quite the booster, sir.

30:12.080 --> 30:13.960
Guess I know who you're  supporting.

30:13.960 --> 30:15.600
Don't be silly, Wade.

30:15.600 --> 30:19.120
These people have all they need.
They want to give the country away.

30:19.120 --> 30:22.840
I wouldn't vote for an Endicott
if my life depended upon it. Sponge.

30:22.840 --> 30:26.840
OK, you said you had fun
at your third birthday, so...

30:26.840 --> 30:30.840
(ALL) Happy birthday!

30:35.040 --> 30:38.120
Kids' party. Enjoy.

30:38.120 --> 30:40.080
Thanks for helping
me set this up.

30:40.080 --> 30:43.240
I think you and I
make a very good team.

30:43.240 --> 30:46.960
Hey, Jack, congrats. Hope this
year's better than the last one.

30:46.960 --> 30:49.160
Me, too.

30:49.160 --> 30:50.520
Happy birthday again.

30:50.520 --> 30:51.560
Thanks again.

30:51.560 --> 30:53.000
Thought about the invitation?

30:53.000 --> 30:53.440
Yeah, I...

30:53.440 --> 30:55.840
Yeah, I...
Boomer.

30:55.840 --> 30:59.800
I've got to see some others.
       Wait a minute.

30:59.800 --> 31:00.840
Jack's so sweet.

31:00.840 --> 31:02.800
Jack's so sweet.
I wouldn't know. Never licked him.

31:02.800 --> 31:05.800
Mona, listen. Yesterday.

31:05.800 --> 31:09.200
I meant it about missing you.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.080
I think I want to bob for apples.

31:11.080 --> 31:11.920
Wayne, how are you doing?

31:11.920 --> 31:13.320
Wayne, how are you doing?
I've got to get her back.

31:13.320 --> 31:15.320
Give me the dirt.
What do you know about Wayne?

31:15.320 --> 31:16.360
Give me the dirt.
What do you know about Wayne?
No.

31:16.360 --> 31:19.400
I room with the guy,
know more than I want to.

31:19.400 --> 31:22.240
The slob raconteur,
often sports no underwear.

31:22.240 --> 31:23.880
        He's bright, witty.

31:23.880 --> 31:26.760
Are you kidding? His clothes are
so wild they kept me awake at night.

31:26.760 --> 31:28.720
Are you kidding? His clothes are
so wild they kept me awake at night.
                   Which one's Mona?

31:28.720 --> 31:30.440
&lt; Every man's dream over there.

31:30.440 --> 31:32.920
&lt; Boob job if I ever saw one.

31:32.920 --> 31:34.840
You kidding? Fun bags?

31:34.840 --> 31:38.280
Mother nature is not that kind.
You'd think a surgeon would know.

31:38.280 --> 31:42.280
Only if the alignment's off.

31:42.360 --> 31:43.840
Thanks.

31:43.840 --> 31:45.200
Well, it's some party.

31:45.200 --> 31:48.280
Yeah, it sure is, and
it's all thanks to Clancy.

31:48.280 --> 31:51.000
Boy, she is terrific, isn't she?

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
Maybe it's not such a bad thing I
 tore my knee. It brought her back.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.040
OK, time to pick to play pin
   the hypo on the donkey.

31:55.040 --> 31:56.280
OK, time to pick to play pin
   the hypo on the donkey.
Oh, no...

31:56.280 --> 31:59.400
Come on, be a good sport.
Here we go. Wait, hold this.

31:59.400 --> 32:01.840
Come on. Play it along.
Roundy round.

32:01.840 --> 32:05.280
Then we'll do some bobbing
for French fries. One more time.

32:05.280 --> 32:06.920
There you go. Go get 'em, killer.

32:06.920 --> 32:09.080
There you go. Go get 'em, killer.
Come on, come on.

32:09.080 --> 32:11.720
       Come through, Boomer.

32:11.720 --> 32:13.760
No, cold, Jack.

32:13.760 --> 32:14.600
Point me to Victor

32:14.600 --> 32:17.480
Point me to Victor
Freezing. Turn around.

32:17.480 --> 32:17.920
Uh-oh.

32:17.920 --> 32:18.560
Uh-oh.
No.

32:18.560 --> 32:19.720
Uh-oh.
No.
No?

32:19.720 --> 32:22.000
I'm gonna come back for you.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
          Warmer. Warmer.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.760
Warmer.

32:25.760 --> 32:27.040
Hot.

32:27.040 --> 32:31.040
(ALL) Yeah!

32:59.840 --> 33:01.080
Any word?

33:01.080 --> 33:05.080
I got tired of waiting
with the body watch upstairs.

33:07.920 --> 33:10.840
My father never believed in God.

33:10.840 --> 33:13.160
He crossed himself on
his death bed -

33:13.160 --> 33:16.280
just in case.

33:16.280 --> 33:20.240
I don't wanna lose Grammy.

33:20.240 --> 33:24.240
Neither do I, Michael.

33:24.640 --> 33:26.760
It must be weird, Dad,

33:26.760 --> 33:30.760
having control over
everything but death.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.040
Do you really think we're
better than anyone else?

33:33.040 --> 33:35.760
Do you really think we're
better than anyone else?
No.

33:35.760 --> 33:38.480
Dougie does.

33:38.480 --> 33:41.160
You, Doug and your cousins

33:41.160 --> 33:44.560
inherited fame without understanding.

33:44.560 --> 33:48.400
Your grandfather worked
very hard to amass a fortune.

33:48.400 --> 33:50.480
And my generation

33:50.480 --> 33:53.200
acquired the power.

33:53.200 --> 33:56.040
All that was left
for your generation

33:56.040 --> 34:00.040
was the shell of celebrity.

34:00.880 --> 34:03.720
It's an empty legacy.

34:03.720 --> 34:07.480
We should give it all away.
Start over.

34:07.480 --> 34:11.480
He hopped on his ox and rode
out beyond the great wall.

34:14.159 --> 34:16.120
You think you'll run for president?

34:16.120 --> 34:19.520
I have no choice.

34:19.520 --> 34:23.520
Well, I do. I don't wanna be
forced to support your ambitions.

34:25.280 --> 34:28.280
No, you'd rather go
hitch-hiking through Mexico.

34:28.280 --> 34:31.000
Get arrested in Machu Picchu.

34:31.000 --> 34:34.320
Set up that windmill energy fiasco.

34:34.320 --> 34:37.880
Don't you see, all I wanted
to do was get you involved,

34:37.880 --> 34:41.880
give you some direction.

34:42.560 --> 34:45.159
Grandma thinks you and I are alike.

34:45.159 --> 34:48.040
Yeah.

34:48.040 --> 34:51.040
I did stupid things
when I was young too.

34:51.040 --> 34:53.800
I know the Endicott name's
a heavy load to bear,

34:53.800 --> 34:57.480
especially for your generation.

34:57.480 --> 35:01.000
So far removed from your
grandfather's vision,

35:01.000 --> 35:04.080
yet still expected to serve him.

35:04.080 --> 35:07.280
It's whacked out in the '80s.

35:07.280 --> 35:10.880
Son, if you have something
better to do with your life,

35:10.880 --> 35:14.880
something you really feel passionate
about, then for God's sake go, run,

35:15.120 --> 35:17.240
no matter what the family says.

35:17.240 --> 35:20.400
Senator Endicott?

35:20.400 --> 35:22.640
I'd like to shake your hand.

35:22.640 --> 35:26.640
No!

35:30.280 --> 35:34.280
Get some help! Please!

35:34.960 --> 35:36.000
         What have we got?

35:36.000 --> 35:40.000
GS 70. Pulse 140.
  I thought I heard a BP of 40.

35:40.840 --> 35:41.520
                   Senator Endicott?

35:41.520 --> 35:43.680
                   Senator Endicott?
Yeah, some nut opened up
     on him in the chapel.

35:43.680 --> 35:47.680
Take your time there,
take your time.

35:49.320 --> 35:51.360
That's great. Get another
          crash cart, would you?

35:51.360 --> 35:54.600
Where the heck is everybody? Pam...

35:54.600 --> 35:57.640
I want a central line
and ringers wide open.

35:57.640 --> 36:00.000
Let's get a test tube tray set up.

36:00.000 --> 36:03.400
You're gonna have
to wait outside, OK?

36:03.400 --> 36:07.320
Tidal volume 800 at a rate of 16.
100% oxygen.

36:07.320 --> 36:11.320
No breath sounds on the left side.
I want a kelly and a test tube.

36:11.440 --> 36:12.680
What calibre was the gun?

36:12.680 --> 36:14.080
What calibre was the gun?
I don't know.

36:14.080 --> 36:17.080
It might help us find the damage he
could have.  They catch the guy?

36:17.080 --> 36:18.680
It might help us find the damage he
could have.  They catch the guy?
Yeah.

36:18.680 --> 36:22.680
Let's go Pam.  Find out the type of
ammo and calibre of gun.

36:22.760 --> 36:26.760
All right, BP's falling.

36:27.680 --> 36:29.400
We're gonna need
type specific blood.

36:29.400 --> 36:30.920
We won't have time for a
 cross match. Can we get a crit?

36:30.920 --> 36:32.200
We won't have time for a
 cross match. Can we get a crit?
21.

36:32.200 --> 36:36.200
This guy's losing blood like crazy.

36:40.760 --> 36:43.040
                       Birthday pie?

36:43.040 --> 36:45.760
Jack's mom always bought it.

36:45.760 --> 36:48.400
You gotta give her credit,
she's got a great sense of humour.

36:48.400 --> 36:49.560
You gotta give her credit,
she's got a great sense of humour.
                I never met his mom.

36:49.560 --> 36:51.120
No, I mean Clancy.

36:51.120 --> 36:52.640
Always gets my jokes.

36:52.640 --> 36:55.600
Mona never met a
punchline she liked.

36:55.600 --> 36:59.600
If you get right down to it, Clancy
and I have much more in common.

36:59.680 --> 37:02.480
I gotta give Boomer credit,
he does take a lot of kidding.

37:02.480 --> 37:04.360
I gotta give Boomer credit,
he does take a lot of kidding.
He deserves a lot of kidding.

37:04.360 --> 37:06.920
I know a whole other
side to him than you do.

37:06.920 --> 37:08.880
What it's like to wake up to him.

37:08.880 --> 37:11.720
You probably don't realise
what a great partner he is.

37:11.720 --> 37:13.480
He's strong, he's sexy...

37:13.480 --> 37:15.960
Having fun?

37:15.960 --> 37:19.200
          What do you think of Mona?

37:19.200 --> 37:21.520
You're asking the wrong person.

37:21.520 --> 37:23.920
             I've been watching her.

37:23.920 --> 37:26.040
                       A great body.

37:26.040 --> 37:28.960
               I mean, she's pretty.

37:28.960 --> 37:31.480
Sure wouldn't mind
getting into her bed.

37:31.480 --> 37:33.120
Look before you leap.

37:33.120 --> 37:37.120
Clancy's been hanging around
Wayne for most of the party.

37:38.400 --> 37:40.480
I wouldn't worry about it.

37:40.480 --> 37:43.120
I can't stand the thought of
Wayne being with another woman.

37:43.120 --> 37:44.440
        It drives me crazy.

37:44.440 --> 37:47.320
Maybe I shouldn't have been so
quick to break off our engagement.

37:47.320 --> 37:50.200
Jack?

37:50.200 --> 37:53.400
Do you mind if I ask you
           a personal question?

37:53.400 --> 37:56.880
Would you be offended if
I were to ask Clancy out?

37:56.880 --> 37:59.560
I don't know. Would you be
offended if I asked Mona out?

37:59.560 --> 38:01.560
No.

38:01.560 --> 38:03.480
I guess it's
all right then, right?

38:03.480 --> 38:06.000
Good.

38:06.000 --> 38:06.920
Hi.

38:06.920 --> 38:08.280
Hi.
Excuse me.

38:08.280 --> 38:11.160
                                 Hi.

38:11.160 --> 38:13.040
               I've changed my mind.

38:13.040 --> 38:17.040
I'd like to take
you up on that offer.

38:17.280 --> 38:19.760
I'm sorry Jack, I have other plans.

38:19.760 --> 38:22.920
Wayne just said you said it's
all right for him to take me out.

38:22.920 --> 38:24.760
No it's not. I wanna be with Wayne.

38:24.760 --> 38:25.880
No it's not. I wanna be with Wayne.
I wanna be with Clancy.

38:25.880 --> 38:26.480
I wanna be with Boomer.

38:26.480 --> 38:27.840
I wanna be with Boomer.
I wanna be with Mona.

38:27.840 --> 38:31.840
I wanna see Mona with Clancy.

38:46.880 --> 38:47.520
How's the OR coming?

38:47.520 --> 38:51.080
How's the OR coming?
They'll be ready in 10 minutes,
    but the heart/lung's in use.

38:51.080 --> 38:52.120
                                 OK.

38:52.120 --> 38:54.240
Four units of blood,
2000cc ringers.

38:54.240 --> 38:55.200
What's the status?

38:55.200 --> 38:57.240
What's the status?
He's lost 1600 cc's of blood.

38:57.240 --> 38:59.200
There's a lot of damage.
I hope we can hold him for the OR.

38:59.200 --> 39:00.840
There's a lot of damage.
I hope we can hold him for the OR.
You've got to sign for the blood.

39:00.840 --> 39:01.520
Forge it.

39:01.520 --> 39:04.040
Forge it.
I can't do that.

39:04.040 --> 39:06.400
Get out of here please.

39:06.400 --> 39:07.520
OK, let's try and get some fluid.

39:07.520 --> 39:10.160
OK, let's try and get some fluid.
Anything I can tell the family?

39:10.160 --> 39:12.000
Don't run for public office.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.360
V-tack!

39:13.360 --> 39:17.360
All right, let's get
X-ray out of here. Lidocaine.

39:25.080 --> 39:29.080
I'm gonna have to shock him.
Paddles... Clear...

39:29.080 --> 39:32.360
140 and I can't find a pulse.

39:32.360 --> 39:34.800
&lt; We'll have to crack his chest.
His heart's pumping no blood.

39:34.800 --> 39:38.800
I'm gonna have to re-glove.
Get me a rib-spreader and a blade.

39:39.600 --> 39:41.440
            How is it?

39:41.440 --> 39:45.440
            How is it?
Looking fine.
       She's still in fibrillation.

39:46.880 --> 39:48.560
     What's your temperature?

39:48.560 --> 39:50.280
36. Three litres per minute.

39:50.280 --> 39:54.280
      Let's defibrillate now.

39:55.160 --> 39:57.200
             Clear...

39:57.200 --> 40:00.640
V tack.

40:00.640 --> 40:04.640
            Lidocaine.

40:04.640 --> 40:07.600
     Nothing's happening here.

40:07.600 --> 40:08.640
How much lidocaine
are you giving it?

40:08.640 --> 40:10.320
How much lidocaine
are you giving it?
Four milligrams per minute.

40:10.320 --> 40:14.200
       That's enough. Again.

40:14.200 --> 40:17.480
             Clear...

40:17.480 --> 40:18.520
Sinus rhythm. &gt;

40:18.520 --> 40:22.240
Pressure holding at 76.

40:22.240 --> 40:26.240
    Let's get her off the pump.

40:35.760 --> 40:39.480
This party's turning into
a drag, don't you think?

40:39.480 --> 40:43.480
It looks like the right time
to spring my surprise gift.

40:50.520 --> 40:51.360
See you, Ellen.

40:51.360 --> 40:53.240
See you, Ellen.
Where are you going?

40:53.240 --> 40:57.240
Guess I'm not
really in the party mood.

41:00.600 --> 41:03.000
Can I have everybody's
attention please?

41:03.000 --> 41:04.960
I've got a small presentation here.

41:04.960 --> 41:07.960
Boomer, stand up...

41:07.960 --> 41:10.880
Before we get back to
the grim business of body repair,

41:10.880 --> 41:14.880
I'd like to present you
with my special token of esteem.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.360
A little present I cooked up.

41:18.360 --> 41:20.880
Oh, thanks.

41:20.880 --> 41:24.880
Happy birthday!

41:25.400 --> 41:26.640
You jerk.

41:26.640 --> 41:28.880
Wait a second, Boomer,
that's only half the gift.

41:28.880 --> 41:31.320
 See, I only hit you with one pie.

41:31.320 --> 41:32.960
              This is the good part.

41:32.960 --> 41:36.960
 You get to hit me with the other.

41:38.680 --> 41:41.800
  You like this? Yeah? All right?

41:41.800 --> 41:45.160
OK, hit me with your best shot.
Right here, right here, yeah.

41:45.160 --> 41:49.160
Right?

41:52.640 --> 41:56.640
               Oh...

42:01.600 --> 42:03.600
Boysenberry.

42:03.600 --> 42:04.720
        Still no pressure.

42:04.720 --> 42:08.640
Pulse not filling. Can you
   take over here, Dr Westwood?

42:08.640 --> 42:09.800
They're set in OR.

42:09.800 --> 42:11.760
Keep begging them.

42:11.760 --> 42:15.440
The bullet tore through the
pulmonary artery and aorta.

42:15.440 --> 42:16.840
How long we been here?

42:16.840 --> 42:19.000
40 minutes.

42:19.000 --> 42:23.000
Your call?

42:23.600 --> 42:26.520
I hate to say it, but...
     he's had his time.

42:26.520 --> 42:29.480
     I could sew up the heart.

42:29.480 --> 42:33.480
Nothing to sew.

43:01.440 --> 43:03.960
       That's it, I'm done.

43:03.960 --> 43:06.480
Dr Kiley, it's
anaesthesia's job to pull her

43:06.480 --> 43:08.320
off the drugs and keep her stable.

43:08.320 --> 43:11.080
I want a good rhythm and pressure.

43:11.080 --> 43:13.880
BP's 105 over 48. Pulse is 58.

43:13.880 --> 43:15.720
      You're letting it fall.

43:15.720 --> 43:18.800
BP's 90, pulse is 48.

43:18.800 --> 43:20.600
For crying out loud, you knucklehead,

43:20.600 --> 43:22.560
her vitals are dropping like a rock,
give her some atropine.

43:22.560 --> 43:24.080
her vitals are dropping like a rock,
give her some atropine.
A milligram of atropine.

43:24.080 --> 43:24.880
           Increase it!

43:24.880 --> 43:27.000
           Increase it!
BP's 82, pulse 38.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.800
   Damn it, you're killing her!

43:28.800 --> 43:30.640
We just sweated through four hours

43:30.640 --> 43:33.960
of surgery while you sat on your can
and dreamed about the Dow Jones.

43:33.960 --> 43:35.440
         Now get it right!

43:35.440 --> 43:39.440
90 and 62. Coming up.

43:39.680 --> 43:40.840
            About time.

43:40.840 --> 43:44.840
      All right, let's close.

43:50.440 --> 43:54.440
Hiya.

44:36.240 --> 44:56.000
