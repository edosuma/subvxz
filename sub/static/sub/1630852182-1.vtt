WEBVTT

00:47.655 --> 00:48.723
Yeah.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.558
You're late, Danny.

00:50.592 --> 00:51.593
On my way.

00:52.794 --> 00:54.863
Did you bring it?

00:54.896 --> 00:57.166
Of course I
fucking brought it.

00:57.199 --> 01:00.036
Good, 'cause this
doesn't go without the package.

01:04.173 --> 01:05.774
Fuck me.

02:52.814 --> 02:54.350
- I want liver and onions.
- Mr. Bernadette,

02:54.383 --> 02:56.118
we need to go back to
our room now for lunch.

02:56.152 --> 02:57.685
Well, I don't like meatloaf,

02:57.719 --> 02:59.288
and I just want
liver and onions,

02:59.321 --> 03:00.422
and a side of green beans.

03:00.456 --> 03:02.024
- I know.
- I don't like it.

03:02.057 --> 03:03.192
- Let's go.
- I don't.

03:04.293 --> 03:05.394
I'm so sorry, sir.

03:06.861 --> 03:09.231
So you were saying
Debi's no longer going

03:09.265 --> 03:11.433
to be staying in
the Villa Deluxes?

03:11.467 --> 03:12.667
May I ask why?

03:16.071 --> 03:17.273
I just can't afford it.

03:18.407 --> 03:22.244
So please if we could move
her back to a basic room.

03:24.313 --> 03:26.714
Unfortunately, I
cannot negotiate that

03:26.748 --> 03:29.218
with anyone other than
Dean or Nancy Boon.

03:30.119 --> 03:30.986
He's dead.

03:34.356 --> 03:38.294
Died last week in a
car wreck, Nancy too,

03:40.296 --> 03:42.897
and their two
children, my nephews.

03:44.899 --> 03:45.900
Today's the funeral.

03:48.437 --> 03:51.340
I'm terribly sorry
for your loss, Mr. Boon.

03:52.341 --> 03:55.344
Horrible, just horrible.

03:57.812 --> 03:59.281
Did you inform your mother?

04:01.517 --> 04:03.452
She doesn't know.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.189
Shit, she won't know shit. She
doesn't even know where she is.

04:07.223 --> 04:10.426
She thinks I'm a fucking
milkman from 1956,

04:10.459 --> 04:14.230
and you ask me if
I informed her.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.168
Excuse me.

04:32.214 --> 04:35.883
I'll be taking
over her finances.

04:35.917 --> 04:38.053
I'll be back this
afternoon to bring her to,

04:40.456 --> 04:41.991
to bring her to the funeral.

04:45.060 --> 04:48.097
Look, I know
exactly what I did.

04:48.130 --> 04:51.433
Not proud of it, it's just
she was a real pretty girl

04:51.467 --> 04:53.901
I knew from school,
and we were alone,

04:53.935 --> 04:55.237
and no one was even here.

04:56.472 --> 05:01.176
So I am sorry but it's not
like we did anything that bad,

05:03.579 --> 05:05.080
we just made out.

05:06.615 --> 05:08.916
But my dad used to tell me that,

05:08.950 --> 05:10.119
"If you see a girl that's pretty

05:10.152 --> 05:12.954
and you think you got a
shot well, you take it

05:14.456 --> 05:16.592
'cause you may not
get another one."

05:16.625 --> 05:20.596
Kid, I
don't give a shit

05:20.629 --> 05:23.198
if you got off in my store,

05:23.232 --> 05:25.034
but check this out.

05:32.041 --> 05:33.908
Right there, see
that right there!

05:35.010 --> 05:37.313
That's what you call stealing.

05:37.346 --> 05:38.614
And I tell you what,

05:38.647 --> 05:42.151
I'm gonna press charges
on your white trash ass.

05:47.489 --> 05:50.092
Hey, hey, you little shit!

05:50.125 --> 05:52.294
You son of a bitch.

05:52.328 --> 05:54.596
You little shit, come back here!

05:54.630 --> 05:56.098
I'm calling the cops!

07:21.583 --> 07:23.218
Hold up, son.

07:25.621 --> 07:28.657
Motley Adams, it's a
little early in the day

07:28.690 --> 07:30.559
for you to be
loitering my streets.

07:31.760 --> 07:33.495
Just
walking to my friends.

07:34.663 --> 07:36.532
Does your momma
know you drink now?

07:37.399 --> 07:40.235
What?

07:40.269 --> 07:41.136
No.

07:42.070 --> 07:45.407
No, she don't know
or no, you don't drink?

07:47.776 --> 07:49.478
No, I don't drink.

07:53.649 --> 07:56.418
Then why are
you stealing beer?

07:58.487 --> 08:00.689
Ed's gonna file a complaint.

08:00.722 --> 08:03.058
I don't know what
you're talking about.

08:03.091 --> 08:06.061
Well, your
brother taught you well.

08:09.264 --> 08:10.599
Sheriff,
we got ourselves a 10-29V

08:10.632 --> 08:12.301
over on Deli street.

08:12.334 --> 08:14.136
Possibly the same car in
the robbery yesterday.

08:14.169 --> 08:15.504
I'll be talking to you, Mot.

08:15.537 --> 08:17.739
Say hi to your brother for me

08:17.773 --> 08:19.508
and that pretty
momma of yours too.

08:36.391 --> 08:37.493
Get in the fucking truck.

08:37.526 --> 08:38.627
- Danny, I didn't-
- Let's go.

08:38.660 --> 08:39.495
Do
anything, I promise.

08:52.174 --> 08:53.475
Oh, it's
like that huh, D?

09:13.161 --> 09:14.229
Where are we going?

09:16.231 --> 09:17.499
We gotta leave.

09:17.533 --> 09:18.767
Leave?

09:18.800 --> 09:20.469
You remember Uncle George?

09:20.502 --> 09:21.637
No.

09:21.670 --> 09:24.206
Shit, right, you
ain't never met.

09:25.574 --> 09:26.775
He lives in Oklahoma, and
that's where we're going.

09:26.808 --> 09:28.477
Oklahoma?

09:28.510 --> 09:30.646
You got a fucking
hearing problem?

09:30.679 --> 09:32.281
Yes, Oklahoma.

09:33.181 --> 09:34.516
Wait, what the hell?

09:34.550 --> 09:36.084
No, I'm not going to-

09:36.118 --> 09:36.785
- Shut up, Mot!

09:37.886 --> 09:39.354
Uh, what the fuck
you, Danny, no!

09:39.388 --> 09:40.322
Shut the fuck up!

09:40.355 --> 09:42.224
Fuck you, no, I'm not going!

09:42.257 --> 09:44.293
What the fuck is there
for us in Oklahoma, man?

09:44.326 --> 09:45.460
What about Mom?

09:45.494 --> 09:47.329
Mot, I don't have
time to argue with you.

09:48.664 --> 09:52.534
Just please, please listen
to me, I'm in trouble.

09:54.436 --> 09:55.404
I'm in trouble.

09:56.371 --> 09:58.540
It would be best for
Mom if we both leave.

10:04.279 --> 10:05.147
Fuck!

10:15.824 --> 10:17.225
Fuck!

10:17.259 --> 10:20.696
Mot, get in the back,
and stay down, now!

10:27.936 --> 10:28.770
I said get down!

10:31.573 --> 10:36.578
I don't wanna go
under the blankets.

10:57.499 --> 10:59.501
Whatever happens
you stay quiet.

10:59.534 --> 11:00.902
Don't you dare make a noise.

11:02.437 --> 11:04.640
If this should go
bad, get back home,

11:04.673 --> 11:07.743
and you grab Daddy's urn
and Mom, and you leave.

11:07.776 --> 11:08.910
What's going on?

11:08.944 --> 11:10.145
Shut up, Mot!

11:13.749 --> 11:14.683
Just shut up.

11:22.257 --> 11:22.924
Hutch.

11:31.933 --> 11:33.301
Dan the Man Adams.

11:38.940 --> 11:39.908
Been trying to call you.

11:44.946 --> 11:46.415
You don't answer your phone.

12:13.575 --> 12:15.744
This fuckin' lighter sucks.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.685
Let's go talk to the boss.

13:24.613 --> 13:25.814
Why don't you kill it.

13:27.415 --> 13:28.316
Hang tight.

13:30.119 --> 13:30.987
Boss.

13:33.688 --> 13:34.790
Morning, Danny.

13:34.823 --> 13:35.992
Morning, Boss.

13:36.958 --> 13:38.627
Beautiful, ain't it?

13:38.660 --> 13:39.895
Huh?

13:39.928 --> 13:42.764
I was up with
my grandson this morning

13:42.798 --> 13:44.733
watching that gorgeous sunrise.

13:44.766 --> 13:46.501
You met him, right?

13:46.535 --> 13:48.004
Yes, sir, of course.

13:48.037 --> 13:50.605
Real handsome one is
what you should be saying.

13:50.639 --> 13:51.873
Real handsome one, yes, sir.

13:51.907 --> 13:54.476
Yeah.

13:54.509 --> 13:57.345
It's those
moments you realize

13:57.379 --> 14:02.350
how lucky you are to be
alive, just to exist.

14:05.453 --> 14:06.855
You know when you
live as long as I have

14:06.888 --> 14:08.057
and you got through as much shit

14:08.090 --> 14:09.858
as a man like me
has to go through

14:11.027 --> 14:12.828
you start to soak up
all the simple things

14:12.861 --> 14:17.866
in life like sunrises,
and coffee,

14:20.402 --> 14:22.370
and all that which
makes the world

14:22.404 --> 14:26.474
what it is, which is beautiful.

14:28.577 --> 14:32.148
You know I was
thinking this morning

14:32.181 --> 14:37.086
while I was sipping my
coffee that I am lucky

14:39.721 --> 14:41.723
but I worked my ass
off to get here.

14:43.658 --> 14:45.861
I put things in place to
start something special

14:45.894 --> 14:50.899
and not just for me for my
family, for others, for you.

14:52.901 --> 14:54.136
Everyone benefits.

14:56.205 --> 14:58.406
You like this
truck you got here?

14:58.440 --> 15:00.142
Yes, sir, I do very much.

15:02.844 --> 15:04.913
I heard from
an old friend of mine

15:06.015 --> 15:07.849
there are dark forces abound,

15:10.719 --> 15:14.923
someone talking, saying
things that could bring down

15:14.956 --> 15:17.093
this whole big beautiful world.

15:18.727 --> 15:21.496
No, sir, I ain't
said nothing to anyone.

15:22.864 --> 15:26.002
They tried, I didn't
tell them anything.

15:27.736 --> 15:29.638
Well, that
may be true, Danny,

15:31.007 --> 15:32.707
but sometimes these dark forces

15:32.741 --> 15:37.579
they don't just want ya
saying things, no, no,

15:41.616 --> 15:42.918
sometimes they want you

15:42.951 --> 15:47.622
to bring them something,
like evidence.

15:50.226 --> 15:51.726
Maybe that's what they want.

15:57.133 --> 16:00.535
You've been good to me, Mr.
Haywood, me and my family.

16:02.071 --> 16:05.807
I wouldn't do anything
like that, I owe you.

16:10.745 --> 16:11.613
Jed.

16:14.883 --> 16:16.018
My friends call me Jed.

16:21.023 --> 16:23.792
You're my friend, right, Danny?

16:23.825 --> 16:25.061
Yes, sir.

16:25.094 --> 16:27.997
- Jed.
- Yes, Jed, I'm your friend,

16:29.098 --> 16:30.199
but I'm also not a rat.

16:31.800 --> 16:36.805
Hmm, maybe it's
that friend of yours

16:38.140 --> 16:42.211
you brought on last month,
that uh, colored boy, Paul.

16:46.048 --> 16:49.951
Neither of us would talk
or take anything from you.

16:50.852 --> 16:55.224
We just, they scared us is all.

16:55.257 --> 16:57.159
They had us in a tight spot,

16:58.660 --> 17:02.864
and that's, that's why I
haven't been calling you back,

17:04.766 --> 17:06.268
that's why.

17:06.302 --> 17:07.236
Look...

17:10.306 --> 17:12.707
I swear on my fuckin' life.

17:57.086 --> 17:59.854
Hutch, get
Hank on the phone.

17:59.888 --> 18:01.723
Crush the truck,
and burn the body.

18:07.296 --> 18:10.732
Just can't get any good
help these days, huh, Boss?

18:10.765 --> 18:14.270
No, this is serious,
make this disappear.

18:15.770 --> 18:17.639
If they already got to him
chances are they got to others.

18:18.773 --> 18:20.009
This never happened.

18:22.211 --> 18:26.082
I told you when you brought
Danny in, I saw he was weak.

18:26.115 --> 18:27.615
Should have my
fucking head examined

18:27.649 --> 18:29.151
bringing in a kid.

18:29.185 --> 18:31.987
Boss, he wasn't
a kid, he was a man

18:32.021 --> 18:33.322
who made his own choices.

18:34.423 --> 18:35.757
He knew better not
to get involved

18:35.790 --> 18:37.126
or he didn't have the balls.

18:39.195 --> 18:40.062
Know what I mean?

18:41.896 --> 18:44.033
Get this piece
of shit out of here.

18:47.769 --> 18:48.837
Okay, Boss.

19:01.283 --> 19:02.084
Shh.

19:05.187 --> 19:06.322
Fucking gross.

19:48.930 --> 19:51.200
See what you can do with it.

20:04.480 --> 20:06.415
Some fancy duds there, Hutch.

20:09.018 --> 20:10.252
Shut the fuck up.

20:12.254 --> 20:14.056
Just saying yellow
is your color.

20:23.765 --> 20:26.268
Hey, you
want any of these blankets?

20:26.302 --> 20:27.902
Fuck no.

20:28.870 --> 20:30.406
Some of these are pretty nice.

20:37.346 --> 20:39.148
It's gonna
cost a little extra, Hutch.

20:41.916 --> 20:43.118
What the fuck did you say?

20:43.152 --> 20:44.953
It's gonna cost
you a little extra.

20:47.156 --> 20:48.457
And why's that?

21:01.337 --> 21:02.104
Hutch.

21:05.807 --> 21:06.941
Who the fuck is that?

22:18.213 --> 22:19.081
Fuck!

22:52.947 --> 22:53.582
Hey.

22:54.616 --> 22:56.085
We got a problem.

23:06.161 --> 23:07.062
Hey.

23:08.930 --> 23:11.600
I got somethin'
for you, call me.

23:15.637 --> 23:16.605
What are you doing?

23:16.638 --> 23:17.306
Yeah.

23:27.516 --> 23:29.418
Da, da, da, do.

23:29.451 --> 23:32.121
Here we go, you
handsome little devil.

23:32.154 --> 23:34.356
Yes, you are.

23:34.390 --> 23:35.224
Yes, you are.

23:35.257 --> 23:36.125
Oh, yes.

23:38.660 --> 23:40.362
Grandpa loves you.

23:40.396 --> 23:42.197
I love you so much.

23:42.231 --> 23:43.931
You get your little legs going.

23:43.965 --> 23:45.601
You get them little legs going.

23:45.634 --> 23:48.103
Yes, you do, yes, you do.

23:48.137 --> 23:49.937
Are we gonna eat breakfast?

23:49.971 --> 23:51.373
Oh, yeah, oh, oh, oh,

23:51.407 --> 23:53.342
you getting fussy,
you getting fussy.

23:53.375 --> 23:54.643
You want some breakfast?

23:54.676 --> 23:56.979
How about some pancakes?

23:57.012 --> 23:59.114
I need to lose this
baby weight, Daddy.

23:59.148 --> 23:59.982
Baby weight?

24:01.083 --> 24:03.619
There you go.

24:03.652 --> 24:06.388
Oh, you're getting tired.

24:06.422 --> 24:07.423
I got him.

24:20.335 --> 24:24.273
Boon, I am so
sorry for your loss.

24:31.346 --> 24:35.083
You need anything, anything
at all, you just ask.

24:44.126 --> 24:47.396
Uh, congratulations
on your grandson.

24:49.198 --> 24:50.399
Much appreciated.

24:51.533 --> 24:52.701
How long they staying?

24:53.569 --> 24:55.404
Uh, not sure.

24:55.437 --> 24:57.539
Still gotta find Colt's Daddy.

24:57.573 --> 25:00.175
After I kill him they'll
probably move in permanent.

25:01.410 --> 25:03.612
I like having my
grandson around.

25:03.645 --> 25:04.780
Thinking maybe he'll get me

25:04.813 --> 25:07.583
to give up all this
outlawing and go legit.

25:09.084 --> 25:12.020
Nothing like a
newborn baby to melt your heart.

25:16.124 --> 25:17.392
Looks like they're almost done.

25:24.766 --> 25:28.103
Look, uh, I'd love to help

25:28.136 --> 25:30.706
but today's just not a good day.

25:32.307 --> 25:33.175
Look, Boon,

25:34.710 --> 25:36.545
I know you're up
to your neck in it.

25:38.180 --> 25:40.382
My little brother Samson
drowned in the Red River 1977,

25:42.651 --> 25:44.686
1977.

25:45.587 --> 25:46.788
damn near destroyed our family.

25:48.390 --> 25:50.759
Samson was a little
shit I'll give you that,

25:50.792 --> 25:52.628
there were times I wanted
to smother him myself,

25:52.661 --> 25:56.632
but he was my little brother.

25:58.133 --> 26:00.269
Left a hole in my heart
that's still there.

26:03.138 --> 26:05.674
Wouldn't even ask today
being what today is,

26:07.543 --> 26:10.579
but I have to, it's
awfully important.

26:11.580 --> 26:12.447
I need you.

26:16.485 --> 26:17.352
Walk with me.

26:32.301 --> 26:33.535
What did he do?

26:34.536 --> 26:36.405
Took something from me.

26:36.438 --> 26:38.106
Had to let him go.

26:38.140 --> 26:39.508
What did he take?

26:39.541 --> 26:41.710
Ruby worth a pretty penny.

26:43.245 --> 26:46.782
After the Houston job he
slipped it out of the stash.

26:46.815 --> 26:48.417
Hutch found out a day too late.

26:49.785 --> 26:52.187
Turns out what we believe to
be Danny's younger brother

26:52.220 --> 26:53.789
was witness to us firing him.

26:54.723 --> 26:55.824
He see everything?

26:55.857 --> 26:57.125
Pretty sure he did.

26:58.460 --> 27:01.496
Need the ruby and the kid
brought back here today.

27:03.498 --> 27:05.167
Why don't you just send Hutch?

27:06.301 --> 27:08.904
Needs to be dealt with
in a delicate manner.

27:08.937 --> 27:13.809
Hutch has a temper, and well,
can't just kill the kid,

27:15.344 --> 27:18.280
need to bring him back here,
just talk to him, that's all.

27:19.414 --> 27:20.282
Talk?

27:23.819 --> 27:24.686
Sure.

27:26.421 --> 27:28.156
A little coming
to Jesus meeting.

27:30.392 --> 27:32.427
Look the funeral's
this evening, I just.

27:34.196 --> 27:35.764
Not many get to
walk away, Boon.

27:36.798 --> 27:39.368
We go way back, you're a friend.

32:30.926 --> 32:31.994
Hey, there.

32:33.162 --> 32:34.163
Need a ride?

32:35.097 --> 32:36.165
You a perv?

32:37.166 --> 32:39.701
'Cause I'll beat your ass.

32:39.734 --> 32:41.503
No.

32:41.536 --> 32:42.470
No, I'm not.

32:46.541 --> 32:47.509
What you got there?

32:48.944 --> 32:52.881
Okay, listen to me, son, I need
to talk to you about Danny.

32:55.517 --> 32:56.651
You should come with me.

33:01.756 --> 33:02.590
Yeah.

33:19.574 --> 33:21.609
Fucking rice every day.

33:25.547 --> 33:26.548
Excuse me.

33:27.749 --> 33:28.985
Hey, look, man,
if you have a issue

33:29.018 --> 33:30.585
take it up with the manager.

33:30.618 --> 33:32.587
I don't have an issue,
I have a question.

33:34.156 --> 33:35.324
All right, shoot,
what's your question?

33:35.358 --> 33:38.593
I'm looking for a kid who
works for you, Motley Adams.

33:39.694 --> 33:41.629
Motley Adams doesn't
work here anymore.

33:42.964 --> 33:45.867
His pay stub says he
worked here last week.

33:45.900 --> 33:48.037
All right, he got
fired this morning, okay.

33:48.937 --> 33:50.839
You know where I can find him?

33:50.872 --> 33:52.008
Who the hell are you, man?

33:52.041 --> 33:53.209
What, are you a
cop or something?

33:53.242 --> 33:54.576
Do I look like a cop?

33:58.580 --> 33:59.681
Where can I find him?

34:02.751 --> 34:03.618
Huh?

34:04.619 --> 34:05.988
You might
wanna try his brother

34:06.022 --> 34:08.224
or some kid he hangs out with.

34:09.191 --> 34:10.059
Kid?

34:11.193 --> 34:14.163
Yeah, he's name is uh,
Paul or something like that.

34:17.732 --> 34:18.600
Appreciate it.

34:46.828 --> 34:48.696
Kid's fast, I'm
old, what can I say?

34:49.798 --> 34:51.033
Can't argue with that.

34:52.168 --> 34:54.636
You got a lead on
where he's going?

34:54.669 --> 34:57.605
Yeah, you said, Danny's
got a friend, right?

34:57.639 --> 35:01.609
Yeah, uh,
a black kid, Paul.

35:01.643 --> 35:02.978
That's right.

35:03.012 --> 35:04.013
Yeah, I'll find him.

35:04.879 --> 35:05.847
I'll find 'em both.

35:19.727 --> 35:22.331
Your brother
tell you anything?

35:25.434 --> 35:26.368
- No.
- Hey, Mot,

35:27.669 --> 35:28.803
don't lie to me, bro.

35:29.938 --> 35:34.009
All right, this shit
could fuck me up too.

35:34.043 --> 35:35.710
If Jed took out Danny I mean,

35:40.049 --> 35:42.418
and that dude's on some old
school Dixie mafia type shit.

35:42.451 --> 35:44.719
Man, those motherfuckers
believe in covering their steps.

35:44.752 --> 35:46.921
They know you saw it,
they're gonna come for you.

35:48.124 --> 35:49.024
What's your plan?

35:52.760 --> 35:56.664
He, he, he really fucked,

35:56.698 --> 36:00.835
he uh, he really fucked up.

36:00.869 --> 36:01.769
Say what?

36:06.375 --> 36:09.311
Dan, Danny took
something from him.

36:20.356 --> 36:21.223
What was it?

36:25.227 --> 36:27.029
Goddammit, Mot,
you gotta tell me!

36:27.896 --> 36:29.064
It's just uh,

36:31.900 --> 36:32.934
it's just uh,

36:35.404 --> 36:37.339
it's a red stone or something.

36:38.907 --> 36:42.111
Diamond, that's the
shit he was talking about.

36:42.144 --> 36:44.313
Yeah, he said, he was
in some shit yesterday.

36:47.815 --> 36:50.052
Damn, most be worth a fortune.

36:53.322 --> 36:54.190
You got it?

36:58.826 --> 37:00.062
I don't know, man.

37:00.095 --> 37:02.764
You sure your brother
ain't tell you where it's at?

37:04.966 --> 37:06.968
Yeah, man, no.

37:15.277 --> 37:16.911
You're scared right now, huh?

37:25.154 --> 37:26.854
I just can't
believe he's gone.

37:42.238 --> 37:45.274
He didn't say much.

37:45.307 --> 37:49.311
Yeah, we're on the
corner of Fifth and 20.

37:49.345 --> 37:51.113
Yeah, just tell him
where to meet me, man.

37:51.146 --> 37:52.281
- I don't care-
- Who are you talking to?

37:52.314 --> 37:54.450
Hey, yo, get the fuck
back in there, man!

37:55.484 --> 37:57.019
Who are you talking to, Paul?

37:57.052 --> 37:58.354
I'm trying to
save our ass, aight?

37:58.387 --> 37:59.521
Now get back inside.

38:03.925 --> 38:06.195
Yeah, just.

38:11.333 --> 38:12.967
Where you going?

38:13.002 --> 38:14.336
I'm leaving.

38:14.370 --> 38:15.571
I don't think that's such
a good idea, little man.

38:15.604 --> 38:17.539
You need to stay
here where it's safe.

38:18.840 --> 38:20.075
I don't think it's safe.

38:22.077 --> 38:23.512
I said, you're staying here.

38:30.219 --> 38:33.088
Goddammit, Mot, don't make
me whip your ass, man.

39:15.297 --> 39:16.465
Where's it at?

39:16.498 --> 39:17.366
Come on now.

39:27.909 --> 39:29.178
Whoa, little man.

39:31.580 --> 39:34.983
What the fuck you gonna
do with that, huh?

39:36.318 --> 39:37.286
You gonna shoot me?

39:40.356 --> 39:41.223
We family.

39:43.258 --> 39:45.094
Your brother was,
was my brother.

39:46.095 --> 39:47.262
My brother trusted you.

39:49.231 --> 39:50.399
Hey, I'm
just trying to set

39:50.432 --> 39:51.966
- this straight, Mot.
- You fucking liar!

39:54.336 --> 39:57.639
They killed Danny, and
they're gonna kill me too.

40:05.280 --> 40:07.649
No one ever points a
fucking gun in my face!

40:13.155 --> 40:14.623
Motley, you're coming with me.

40:19.661 --> 40:22.064
Why don't you just
lower that gun?

40:22.097 --> 40:23.265
No one needs to get hurt.

40:25.134 --> 40:26.368
You think I'm a stupid kid?

40:27.969 --> 40:28.970
You're gonna kill me.

40:30.239 --> 40:31.939
If he wanted you dead
you'd be dead already.

40:31.973 --> 40:33.342
He just wants the ruby.

40:34.243 --> 40:35.611
What about my brother, huh?

40:40.015 --> 40:40.649
I get it.

40:42.117 --> 40:43.619
I understand more than you know.

40:44.987 --> 40:46.321
There's only one
way out of here.

40:54.663 --> 40:55.497
Mot!

41:06.108 --> 41:06.974
The feds.

41:12.247 --> 41:13.248
What did you say?

41:14.249 --> 41:17.219
Danny was snitching
to the feds.

41:18.520 --> 41:20.456
Yeah, a dude rolled
up in here earlier

41:20.489 --> 41:22.124
asking questions about Danny.

41:23.258 --> 41:24.760
He said, "They
coming to take him

41:24.793 --> 41:27.763
and all you motherfuckers
down, man!"

42:04.199 --> 42:05.067
Sheriff.

42:06.068 --> 42:08.804
Neighbor said, "They saw
a kid at the front door,

42:08.837 --> 42:10.439
a few minutes later gunshots."

42:11.707 --> 42:14.076
Paul Global's place.

42:14.109 --> 42:15.277
Who?

42:15.310 --> 42:17.679
Tough little shit
runs with Danny Adams.

42:17.713 --> 42:18.580
That figures.

42:20.182 --> 42:22.618
Got a nine millimeter
buried in the wall,

42:22.651 --> 42:24.319
blood splatter on the counter.

43:39.661 --> 43:41.797
Cici's Nail Spa,
how can I help you?

43:41.830 --> 43:43.131
Emily.

43:43.165 --> 43:44.299
Danny.

43:44.333 --> 43:45.500
No,
it's uh, it's Mot.

43:45.534 --> 43:47.369
Oh, you sound
like your brother.

43:47.402 --> 43:48.270
What's up?

43:49.271 --> 43:50.138
Uh,

43:51.673 --> 43:53.442
uh, Emily, I.

43:54.910 --> 43:57.412
Yeah, Mot, can you hurry
it up please, I'm at work.

43:58.880 --> 44:02.884
Um, Emily, I'm,
I'm, I'm in trouble,

44:02.918 --> 44:06.355
and uh, I, and I, and
I need you to help.

44:07.889 --> 44:09.691
What's wrong, have
you talked to Danny?

44:10.826 --> 44:13.528
No, I, I can't talk
to him right now, Emily.

44:13.562 --> 44:17.165
I just, he just.

44:17.199 --> 44:20.469
Okay, all right, I, I think
I know what this is about.

44:20.502 --> 44:23.372
Just come here and we'll
talk about it, all right.

44:23.405 --> 44:25.540
No, no, I, I can't.

44:26.675 --> 44:28.510
Then meet
me at the house.

44:28.543 --> 44:29.745
No.

44:29.778 --> 44:31.213
Then where
do you wanna meet?

44:32.314 --> 44:36.418
You know uh, you
know on the crossroads

44:36.451 --> 44:38.320
where uh, you and Danny first,

44:38.353 --> 44:41.423
well, you know you gave him
a BJ for the first time?

44:42.424 --> 44:44.426
Okay, yes, stop.

44:44.459 --> 44:45.794
- Do you?
- Yes.

44:46.795 --> 44:47.829
Please, Emily.

44:49.398 --> 44:51.433
All right,
Mot, meet you there.

45:35.977 --> 45:38.847
Motley Adams,
hello, there again.

45:40.983 --> 45:42.551
Why don't you get in the car?

45:45.353 --> 45:47.489
Fucking bitch ratted me out.

45:47.522 --> 45:49.758
No, no, no, your
brother ratted first.

45:50.959 --> 45:52.928
Now go on get in
here where it's safe.

45:56.298 --> 45:57.966
Okay, okay, I get it,

45:58.000 --> 46:00.602
I understand, me being
a stranger and all.

46:04.439 --> 46:06.475
I'm Agent Tanner, FBI.

46:09.578 --> 46:12.982
Come on, son, get in
here where it's safe.

46:19.387 --> 46:21.790
Come on, Motley,
just get in the car.

46:49.718 --> 46:51.053
There you go.

46:51.087 --> 46:52.821
What time are you
getting off, sweetheart?

46:52.854 --> 46:53.688
Nine.

46:53.722 --> 46:54.823
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

46:54.856 --> 46:56.025
- Come back.
- Okay.

46:56.058 --> 46:57.759
- Take you into the night.
- Okay.

47:02.031 --> 47:04.299
Please, please, please.

47:05.034 --> 47:05.901
Oh, mercy.

47:14.910 --> 47:16.012
Boss.

47:17.013 --> 47:17.846
There you go.

47:20.016 --> 47:21.550
Oh, yeah.

47:33.495 --> 47:35.463
How you like them pancakes?

47:40.435 --> 47:42.038
Hey, don't mind if I do.

48:08.864 --> 48:10.132
I spilled my beer.

48:11.633 --> 48:12.667
Yeah, what's up?

48:16.872 --> 48:17.939
Boss.

48:21.610 --> 48:24.613
If you're calling me I'm
assuming you don't have the kid.

48:24.646 --> 48:26.048
Is that a fair assumption?

48:27.083 --> 48:28.950
Is this phone secure?

48:28.985 --> 48:30.752
What kind of question is that?

48:30.785 --> 48:32.821
It's a pretty
damn important one.

48:32.854 --> 48:34.489
Yes, of course.

48:34.522 --> 48:36.625
Why didn't you tell
me the kid was a rat?

48:38.560 --> 48:39.961
Well, Boon, maybe I was trying

48:39.996 --> 48:42.098
to be considerate
of your situation.

48:42.131 --> 48:43.832
You dealing with
your brother and all,

48:43.865 --> 48:46.002
I figured you didn't
have to worry about that.

48:47.469 --> 48:49.138
Maybe it's just none
of your business.

48:50.605 --> 48:52.008
Anything else you left out?

48:54.509 --> 48:56.711
Source says
there's a fed in town.

48:57.980 --> 48:59.748
Danny was uh, talking to him.

49:01.250 --> 49:02.684
Now what do you got for me?

49:04.153 --> 49:05.021
I met Paul.

49:06.122 --> 49:07.123
I had to let him go.

49:08.090 --> 49:10.159
Send me the address.

49:10.192 --> 49:11.227
I'll have someone
go clean it up.

49:11.260 --> 49:12.460
I took care of it.

49:13.229 --> 49:14.496
Well, good.

49:15.797 --> 49:17.866
Glad to see you still
got some initiative.

49:20.735 --> 49:22.038
A lot to clean up today.

49:27.609 --> 49:29.644
You in the sticks
or are you in town?

49:29.678 --> 49:31.479
Almost in town.

49:31.513 --> 49:33.615
Okay, come by the Bullfrog.

49:33.648 --> 49:34.783
Why?

49:34.816 --> 49:36.584
'Cause I fucking
said so, Boon.

49:36.618 --> 49:37.752
Drop the shit attitude.

49:38.653 --> 49:39.888
I want you to take Hutch.

49:40.990 --> 49:43.125
No, no, no, I got this.

49:43.159 --> 49:45.194
I'll have the kid and
the ruby within the hour,

49:45.227 --> 49:48.496
and then you can have your
little talk with him, right.

49:49.564 --> 49:50.966
You know what?

49:51.000 --> 49:52.600
How about you do me a favor

49:52.634 --> 49:54.569
and pretend like I'm
still the fucking boss

49:54.602 --> 49:55.804
at least for one more day?

49:55.837 --> 49:58.673
Come get Hutch, then
you two go grab the kid.

49:58.707 --> 50:00.142
You got it?

50:00.176 --> 50:01.010
The baby.

50:05.147 --> 50:07.716
Yes, he's just an asshole.

50:07.749 --> 50:08.650
Yes, he is.

50:47.123 --> 50:48.157
Put it out.

50:55.197 --> 50:56.132
Let's go.

51:05.141 --> 51:06.142
So what now?

51:07.243 --> 51:09.577
I know where he's going.

51:10.745 --> 51:12.680
Well, how's that?

51:14.016 --> 51:16.352
You've been looking for
him since this morning.

51:16.385 --> 51:18.753
He's running out of
places to go in this town,

51:18.787 --> 51:19.654
and he's a kid.

51:21.723 --> 51:22.590
Yeah.

51:23.825 --> 51:26.228
Well, he's a little
shit is what he is,

51:26.262 --> 51:28.930
just like his stupid brother.

51:28.963 --> 51:30.598
Fucking stupid.

51:30.632 --> 51:31.766
The kid's not stupid.

51:32.867 --> 51:37.173
He's angry, he's scared,
but he's not stupid.

51:45.780 --> 51:48.150
Well, let's make this quick.

51:49.651 --> 51:50.919
You got some place to be?

51:52.787 --> 51:55.057
No, but you do.

51:57.293 --> 51:58.160
Don't you?

52:00.029 --> 52:01.930
Don't you got a funeral
to go to, right?

52:16.979 --> 52:18.780
After you.

52:24.453 --> 52:25.753
Shitty motel room.

52:27.189 --> 52:28.723
Sure you're not a perv?

52:28.756 --> 52:31.160
Yeah, well, I gotta
stay off the grid, son.

52:31.193 --> 52:33.095
Local law enforcement
doesn't even know I'm here

52:33.129 --> 52:34.863
and I intend to
keep it that way.

52:36.298 --> 52:37.433
Besides you're not my type,

52:37.466 --> 52:39.634
I like 'em blonde
and double D's.

52:42.704 --> 52:45.773
Now the last time I saw your
brother was early this morning,

52:45.807 --> 52:48.310
he was supposed to
finalize a deal with me,

52:49.478 --> 52:51.913
but I guess he had
a change of heart.

52:51.946 --> 52:53.715
Then I track you down, and uh.

53:01.390 --> 53:03.758
Do you know where your
brother's at, Motley?

53:07.163 --> 53:08.963
You need to listen
to me very carefully

53:08.998 --> 53:10.065
'cause the man your brother

53:10.099 --> 53:12.901
works for is
extremely dangerous.

53:12.934 --> 53:16.871
He won't give two thoughts to
killing you, your mom, Emily,

53:18.274 --> 53:21.010
so if you know something,
anything at all about your brother

53:22.111 --> 53:23.778
now would be a good
time to tell me.

53:35.224 --> 53:39.328
Jed Haywood ran a crew in
Mississippi back in '89, '90,

53:39.361 --> 53:41.829
that was the first time
I'd ever heard of him.

53:43.165 --> 53:47.702
You know, in my line of work
sometimes you see things

53:49.071 --> 53:50.939
that, that stick with you,
things you can't shake.

53:52.874 --> 53:55.144
I remember I was stationed there

53:55.177 --> 53:57.146
for a few weeks working a case,

53:57.179 --> 53:59.847
hell, I can't even
remember what the case was,

54:01.350 --> 54:02.750
but I do remember the morning

54:02.784 --> 54:04.486
we went to Lester
Bowman's apartment.

54:12.228 --> 54:14.896
You see Lester worked with Jed,

54:16.532 --> 54:18.866
and he saw something
that made him turn,

54:20.935 --> 54:22.837
so we went to get
him that morning.

54:24.173 --> 54:27.343
I, I just remember all
the blood, the, the smell.

54:29.578 --> 54:33.015
Lester, his mom, his twin
sisters, even their cat.

54:40.990 --> 54:41.856
Here.

54:47.129 --> 54:52.101
So uh, son, you can
protect your family,

54:53.002 --> 54:54.869
just tell me what happened.

55:01.443 --> 55:03.078
Danny's dead.

55:03.112 --> 55:03.979
They killed him.

55:05.847 --> 55:06.881
No.

55:06.914 --> 55:09.351
Damn, son, I'm, I'm sorry.

55:12.221 --> 55:13.088
Uh.

55:18.960 --> 55:23.465
Yeah, this morning he
was gonna pick me up,

55:23.499 --> 55:28.504
and uh, and we, and
then we were leaving,

55:30.172 --> 55:33.208
and then uh, if he
never picked me up

55:33.242 --> 55:35.077
he, he probably would be alive.

55:38.614 --> 55:40.215
Hey, it's okay.

55:41.650 --> 55:42.584
It's okay.

55:42.618 --> 55:45.354
Look, you'll be all right.

55:46.954 --> 55:50.225
Listen to me, son, what
I'm about to ask you

55:50.259 --> 55:53.329
it's very important
for you to answer me

55:53.362 --> 55:54.496
and tell me the truth.

55:56.465 --> 55:58.033
Did you see your brother die?

56:03.938 --> 56:06.508
Motley, I can get
you and your mom safe

56:06.542 --> 56:08.043
but you gotta tell me now.

56:11.580 --> 56:12.448
And Emily?

56:14.149 --> 56:17.952
Yes, and Emily too.

56:20.356 --> 56:22.890
Did you see Jed Haywood
kill your brother?

56:30.232 --> 56:31.233
See you tomorrow.

56:53.188 --> 56:54.323
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

56:54.356 --> 56:55.190
What are you doing?

56:55.224 --> 56:56.291
Let go of me!

56:56.325 --> 56:58.293
- Shut the fuck up!
- Let go of me! Let go of me!

56:58.327 --> 56:59.395
What are you doing?

56:59.428 --> 57:00.295
Help!

57:00.329 --> 57:01.330
Help, help!

57:02.231 --> 57:03.532
Please help!

57:03.565 --> 57:04.466
Help me!

57:17.513 --> 57:19.047
What do you want?

57:30.626 --> 57:35.330
What did uh, Danny tell
the feds, sweetheart?

57:40.369 --> 57:41.737
What?

57:41.770 --> 57:43.472
What?

57:43.505 --> 57:45.407
I don't know what
you're talking about.

57:51.780 --> 57:52.648
Hey.

57:53.515 --> 57:54.416
Look at me.

57:57.019 --> 57:59.388
Don't make me shoot you, huh.

58:02.090 --> 58:02.957
Bam, bam.

58:07.029 --> 58:10.699
I'm gonna puke.

58:34.556 --> 58:35.991
Emily, look at me.

58:38.093 --> 58:40.996
Jesus, let's get this
thing going for fuck's sake.

58:44.399 --> 58:45.501
Don't listen to him.

58:47.135 --> 58:49.137
I know you're scared but
we're not gonna hurt you.

58:50.172 --> 58:51.740
I need you to answer
me two things,

58:53.742 --> 58:55.110
did you talk to the fed?

59:01.783 --> 59:03.252
Is Danny dead?

59:04.286 --> 59:05.220
Did you kill him?

59:13.595 --> 59:14.496
Danny's not dead.

59:14.530 --> 59:15.764
We hid him from the feds.

59:19.268 --> 59:20.402
They weren't gonna help him,

59:20.435 --> 59:21.637
and they're not
gonna help Motley,

59:21.670 --> 59:23.539
they're just using
him for something.

59:27.142 --> 59:28.343
He's staying with Mot.

59:29.778 --> 59:31.747
He's meeting him, he's with him.

59:35.517 --> 59:36.518
Do you know where?

59:43.759 --> 59:46.395
He said, "He's staying
here until he gets Danny."

59:54.303 --> 59:56.238
Tell Danny, I'm sorry
I talked to them.

59:58.774 --> 1:00:00.108
What?

1:00:00.142 --> 1:00:01.710
She told us everything
we needed to know.

1:00:03.412 --> 1:00:04.680
She was with the fed earlier,

1:00:04.713 --> 1:00:06.515
we could of used her
for more information,

1:00:06.548 --> 1:00:08.283
you sloppy son of a bitch.

1:00:09.484 --> 1:00:12.220
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that little fuck,

1:00:12.254 --> 1:00:13.622
he's with the fed right now.

1:00:15.157 --> 1:00:17.292
Besides the boss says,
"To clean it all up."

1:00:21.730 --> 1:00:24.333
You know you perplex me, Boon,

1:00:25.667 --> 1:00:29.237
last week you and me were
sinking a body in the river,

1:00:32.407 --> 1:00:35.410
and today looks like
you're questioning

1:00:35.444 --> 1:00:36.812
your whole fucking life.

1:00:55.397 --> 1:00:56.365
Yeah.

1:00:56.398 --> 1:00:57.532
Hi, Mr. Boon.

1:00:57.566 --> 1:00:58.900
- This is Lisa with Lakeside.
- Shit.

1:00:58.934 --> 1:01:00.302
I'm just
calling to let you know

1:01:00.335 --> 1:01:01.770
that we have your mom all ready.

1:01:03.805 --> 1:01:04.940
What?

1:01:06.508 --> 1:01:07.376
Clean her up.

1:01:39.274 --> 1:01:41.309
What are you talking about?

1:01:42.644 --> 1:01:43.512
Serious?

1:01:47.749 --> 1:01:48.583
Okay.

1:01:49.851 --> 1:01:51.353
You got it, Boss.

1:02:02.597 --> 1:02:03.832
Don't smoke in my car.

1:02:08.937 --> 1:02:09.771
Fuck that shit!

1:02:16.778 --> 1:02:18.447
He wants us to take out the fed.

1:02:21.616 --> 1:02:22.818
You know what that means.

1:02:26.955 --> 1:02:29.458
It's gonna go to hell in
a hand basket for sure.

1:02:32.028 --> 1:02:33.695
I ain't never killed a fed, you?

1:02:38.467 --> 1:02:39.768
Put that thing out.

1:02:41.970 --> 1:02:43.538
With all due respect

1:02:43.572 --> 1:02:45.941
I'm gonna smoke this
fuckin' cigarette,

1:02:45.974 --> 1:02:47.275
and if you don't like it

1:02:47.309 --> 1:02:48.443
then we can squabble it out

1:02:48.477 --> 1:02:50.046
when all this is
done and over with.

1:02:50.079 --> 1:02:50.946
Is that okay?

1:02:52.848 --> 1:02:54.516
I don't like
you being nervous.

1:02:56.986 --> 1:02:59.387
And I'm not fuckin'
nervous, all right.

1:02:59.421 --> 1:03:00.255
I'm not.

1:03:03.525 --> 1:03:04.559
Just excited is all.

1:03:07.763 --> 1:03:08.630
Let's go.

1:03:20.442 --> 1:03:21.576
What you got there?

1:03:23.345 --> 1:03:25.947
It's uh, my father's ashes.

1:03:27.849 --> 1:03:28.717
Really?

1:03:30.685 --> 1:03:32.521
You uh, think I'll
be able to keep 'em,

1:03:32.554 --> 1:03:35.824
you know if me and my mom
get in witness protection?

1:03:35.857 --> 1:03:37.026
Yeah, yeah, of course.

1:03:37.059 --> 1:03:39.694
Yeah, this is Agent Tanner.

1:03:39.728 --> 1:03:41.830
Yeah, can you put me
through to Lloyd please?

1:03:43.398 --> 1:03:44.566
No, no, no, that's okay.

1:03:44.599 --> 1:03:49.005
Um, just tell him to call me
back at uh, 555-8320, room 114.

1:03:57.379 --> 1:03:58.747
Where you going?

1:03:58.780 --> 1:03:59.948
I'll be back.

1:03:59.982 --> 1:04:02.118
Just gonna see if I can
get a signal outside.

1:04:02.151 --> 1:04:03.318
I have the ruby.

1:04:08.456 --> 1:04:09.825
What ruby, son?

1:04:11.726 --> 1:04:14.096
The ruby Danny stole for you.

1:04:14.130 --> 1:04:15.597
The whole reason he's dead.

1:04:21.970 --> 1:04:24.006
And you got it on you?

1:04:28.777 --> 1:04:29.978
Well, that's good of you, son.

1:04:30.012 --> 1:04:32.048
When I get back we'll
take a look at it.

1:04:46.461 --> 1:04:48.663
Come on, you piece of shit.

1:04:57.806 --> 1:04:59.075
Ah, there we go.

1:05:06.615 --> 1:05:07.549
Fuck me!

1:05:07.582 --> 1:05:08.450
God!

1:05:09.818 --> 1:05:10.685
Fuck!

1:05:11.920 --> 1:05:12.787
Goddammit!

1:05:27.069 --> 1:05:31.007
Fuck.

1:05:53.262 --> 1:05:54.163
Howdy, partner.

1:05:54.196 --> 1:05:56.165
You stupid son of a bitch!

1:05:58.034 --> 1:06:01.137
I'm FBI, you know what
that fucking means?

1:06:03.605 --> 1:06:07.542
Yeah, means you're overpaid.

1:06:14.749 --> 1:06:17.153
Hey, you need to keep quiet!

1:06:19.654 --> 1:06:21.090
Shut the fuck up, Granny!

1:06:21.123 --> 1:06:22.091
Go inside!

1:06:31.300 --> 1:06:32.500
Little fuck!

1:06:45.814 --> 1:06:47.016
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1:06:51.753 --> 1:06:52.654
Finally!

1:06:54.756 --> 1:06:56.058
Let's do him, and let's get.

1:06:57.159 --> 1:06:58.793
Bunch of pissed off people here.

1:07:01.130 --> 1:07:04.100
You don't do as he
says he will kill you.

1:07:05.034 --> 1:07:06.268
Let's get him out of here.

1:07:07.303 --> 1:07:09.704
Fuck that.

1:07:09.738 --> 1:07:11.173
Let's do him now, and let's go.

1:07:12.108 --> 1:07:12.974
We can't.

1:07:13.942 --> 1:07:16.878
We need the ruby, and
he knows where it's at.

1:07:18.646 --> 1:07:21.117
The boss don't give a
shit about the ruby anymore.

1:07:22.751 --> 1:07:23.618
I do.

1:07:24.353 --> 1:07:25.221
Don't you?

1:07:30.292 --> 1:07:32.261
Let's take him down to the lake.

1:07:32.294 --> 1:07:33.561
I'll make him talk.

1:07:39.301 --> 1:07:43.638
So what you and
me split the ruby?

1:07:46.042 --> 1:07:46.908
That's right.

1:07:53.115 --> 1:07:53.983
Let's go, kid.

1:08:23.079 --> 1:08:24.913
Why are you doing this?

1:08:24.946 --> 1:08:27.782
Your fucking brother,
he was a coward.

1:08:29.651 --> 1:08:30.685
Snitched.

1:08:30.718 --> 1:08:31.987
He wasn't no snitch!

1:08:33.422 --> 1:08:35.091
We were running away.

1:08:35.124 --> 1:08:36.925
We, we weren't even gonna
do anything to y'all.

1:08:36.958 --> 1:08:38.094
He was gonna sell that rock,

1:08:38.127 --> 1:08:39.095
- and we woulda just-
- Your brother-

1:08:39.128 --> 1:08:39.961
- Disappeared.
- Was stupid!

1:08:39.995 --> 1:08:40.996
No, he wasn't.

1:08:42.164 --> 1:08:43.332
You know what it takes

1:08:43.365 --> 1:08:46.734
to move a ruby like
that over here, yeah?

1:08:48.404 --> 1:08:49.637
Greedy little shit.

1:08:54.176 --> 1:08:55.044
Give me.

1:08:55.077 --> 1:08:55.910
- Fuck.
- Fuck you!

1:08:57.712 --> 1:08:59.281
Where's it at goddammit?

1:09:10.859 --> 1:09:13.062
What the fuck is this shit?

1:09:19.435 --> 1:09:21.370
Haven't you ever
seen an urn before?

1:09:23.072 --> 1:09:24.240
For ashes.

1:09:24.273 --> 1:09:25.141
Fuck.

1:09:27.243 --> 1:09:29.078
You mean dead peoples ashes?

1:09:32.914 --> 1:09:33.815
It's gross.

1:09:35.817 --> 1:09:37.386
Hey, show some respect.

1:09:44.293 --> 1:09:47.229
What the fuck is
this?

1:09:48.464 --> 1:09:49.764
You know you're right,

1:09:49.797 --> 1:09:52.101
you know the kid
ain't all that stupid.

1:09:52.134 --> 1:09:54.303
I mean throwing it in
this dead man's ashes

1:09:54.336 --> 1:09:58.740
I mean god, that's fuckin'
brilliant, brilliant!

1:09:59.874 --> 1:10:03.279
Fucking unbelievable.

1:10:05.181 --> 1:10:06.315
That was easy.

1:10:33.409 --> 1:10:34.809
It's your turn.

1:10:35.944 --> 1:10:38.013
Been dumping all
the bodies today.

1:10:43.885 --> 1:10:44.752
Let's go.

1:10:46.788 --> 1:10:48.157
Come on, let's go.

1:10:54.396 --> 1:10:55.297
Kneel down.

1:10:59.134 --> 1:11:01.237
Please don't, please, man.

1:11:01.270 --> 1:11:03.005
Please don't, please.

1:11:10.112 --> 1:11:11.447
Come on already.

1:11:11.480 --> 1:11:16.485
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1:12:14.209 --> 1:12:15.943
Why'd you do that?

1:12:18.614 --> 1:12:20.349
I didn't like him.

1:12:43.672 --> 1:12:45.341
What do I do now?

1:12:48.677 --> 1:12:50.412
I don't know, kid.

1:13:05.094 --> 1:13:07.363
Everything's so fucked up.

1:13:10.932 --> 1:13:12.634
Did you get along
with your brother?

1:13:20.609 --> 1:13:21.477
I guess.

1:13:22.678 --> 1:13:27.416
I mean, I, he was just more
like a dad most of the time.

1:13:30.386 --> 1:13:31.919
Yeah, mine too.

1:13:36.325 --> 1:13:38.193
I wonder what he'd
tell me to do now.

1:13:42.531 --> 1:13:44.600
You got a mom right?

1:13:44.633 --> 1:13:45.501
Yeah.

1:13:50.372 --> 1:13:51.240
Go to her.

1:16:38.373 --> 1:16:39.641
Jesus, Motley.

1:16:42.144 --> 1:16:44.279
I've been trying to call
your brother all day.

1:16:45.247 --> 1:16:46.782
Oh, my god, honey, get in.

1:16:51.353 --> 1:16:52.487
His younger brother's is here,

1:16:52.521 --> 1:16:54.289
and says, "He ain't
seen him all day."

1:16:54.323 --> 1:16:56.291
Now they live together,
and that ain't normal.

1:16:56.325 --> 1:16:58.093
My son is missing goddammit!

1:17:05.701 --> 1:17:07.202
He's gonna come talk to you.

1:17:08.403 --> 1:17:09.838
I want you to tell
him about that Paul,

1:17:09.871 --> 1:17:11.573
and what he done to your face.

1:17:13.275 --> 1:17:14.409
We'll track Danny down.

1:17:15.844 --> 1:17:17.713
In the meantime you
can stay with me.

1:17:21.683 --> 1:17:22.551
Ah, shit.

1:17:24.286 --> 1:17:26.655
Did you have any idea
the FBI was in town?

1:17:26.688 --> 1:17:27.556
Do now.

1:17:28.824 --> 1:17:31.360
He should of
called for backup.

1:17:31.393 --> 1:17:32.894
Sheriff
Quincy, come in.

1:17:35.964 --> 1:17:37.699
Quincy, over.

1:17:37.733 --> 1:17:40.302
We have a
personal request for you.

1:17:40.335 --> 1:17:43.271
Well, as much as that warms
the cockles of my heart,

1:17:43.305 --> 1:17:46.375
I'm not the menu
item of the day.

1:17:46.408 --> 1:17:47.342
It's Sally Adams.

1:17:47.376 --> 1:17:48.577
She's demanding to talk to you.

1:17:48.610 --> 1:17:51.480
So yeah, you heard
about two, two rounds.

1:17:51.513 --> 1:17:53.248
What's with the casing?

1:17:53.281 --> 1:17:55.217
Always make time for a lady.

1:17:59.821 --> 1:18:01.556
Good evening, Ms. Adams.

1:18:01.590 --> 1:18:02.924
It's Mrs. Adams.

1:18:02.958 --> 1:18:05.827
And what are you gonna
do about this bastard?

1:18:05.861 --> 1:18:07.529
I love to hear
you talk, Sally,

1:18:07.562 --> 1:18:10.732
even when I don't know
what you're talking about.

1:18:10.766 --> 1:18:12.701
That son of a bitch
assaulted my son.

1:18:16.005 --> 1:18:18.740
All right, son, why don't you
just come with me for a bit.

1:18:18.774 --> 1:18:22.177
Uh, seems like you're up to
your neck in trouble today.

1:18:36.458 --> 1:18:37.392
10-4.

1:18:42.564 --> 1:18:44.299
Danny's dead, Sheriff.

1:18:45.567 --> 1:18:47.235
Dead?

1:18:47.269 --> 1:18:47.903
How?

1:18:47.936 --> 1:18:48.804
Jed Haywood shot him.

1:18:51.440 --> 1:18:52.307
I saw it.

1:18:54.843 --> 1:18:55.944
I'm sorry, son.

1:18:59.048 --> 1:19:00.348
I truly am.

1:19:05.520 --> 1:19:06.955
Howdy.

1:19:06.989 --> 1:19:08.790
I got somethin' of
interest to you.

1:19:10.425 --> 1:19:12.227
Yeah, it's fine,
I'm coming to you.

1:19:15.998 --> 1:19:17.699
Thought we were
going to the station.

1:19:18.834 --> 1:19:20.502
Gotta make a quick
pit stop first.

1:20:17.994 --> 1:20:18.995
Yeah.

1:20:19.028 --> 1:20:20.595
Where are you?

1:20:20.629 --> 1:20:21.930
Cleaning up.

1:20:21.963 --> 1:20:23.065
Cleaning what?

1:20:24.499 --> 1:20:25.367
You know.

1:20:26.102 --> 1:20:29.337
No, Boon, I don't know.

1:20:29.371 --> 1:20:30.672
Why don't you enlighten me.

1:20:31.740 --> 1:20:32.607
The fed.

1:20:35.911 --> 1:20:36.912
And the kid?

1:20:38.446 --> 1:20:39.314
No.

1:20:41.950 --> 1:20:42.851
That one got away.

1:20:44.519 --> 1:20:47.756
All right,
well, he didn't get far.

1:20:47.789 --> 1:20:51.093
What do you mean
he didn't get far?

1:20:51.127 --> 1:20:52.594
Don't worry about it.

1:20:52.627 --> 1:20:54.429
Now you take care
of your family.

1:20:54.462 --> 1:20:56.498
You see that
they're put to rest.

1:20:56.531 --> 1:20:58.333
I'm sorry about that.

1:21:29.165 --> 1:21:31.067
Oh, Mr. Boon, we have
your mom all dolled up

1:21:31.100 --> 1:21:31.967
and ready to go.

1:21:33.002 --> 1:21:33.869
Mr. Boon.

1:21:53.688 --> 1:21:54.589
What's going on?

1:21:58.660 --> 1:21:59.494
Why are we here?

1:21:59.527 --> 1:22:00.162
Stop.

1:22:01.663 --> 1:22:04.100
What's going on?

1:22:08.070 --> 1:22:09.971
What are you doing?

1:22:15.011 --> 1:22:18.014
I'm just gonna go get
some of this sorted out.

1:22:18.047 --> 1:22:21.583
You are gonna sit tight, be
chill, and I'll be right back.

1:22:23.752 --> 1:22:25.654
Oh, Sheriff.

1:22:25.687 --> 1:22:26.955
Sheriff, no!

1:22:26.989 --> 1:22:28.090
Sheriff!

1:22:28.124 --> 1:22:29.125
Sheriff, no!

1:22:30.159 --> 1:22:31.193
You fucking liar!

1:22:31.227 --> 1:22:32.827
You fuck!

1:22:32.861 --> 1:22:33.728
No, fuck!

1:22:34.829 --> 1:22:35.697
Sheriff!

1:22:36.898 --> 1:22:37.832
Fuck, fuck!

1:22:50.946 --> 1:22:51.880
Much obliged.

1:22:54.549 --> 1:22:57.119
So where's the kid?

1:23:00.622 --> 1:23:03.658
Well, that is uh,
kinda what I was wanting

1:23:03.692 --> 1:23:04.893
to talk to you about.

1:23:07.729 --> 1:23:10.732
Okay, so talk.

1:23:15.271 --> 1:23:17.073
You can't have him.

1:23:19.175 --> 1:23:21.143
I already know what
you're gonna ask.

1:23:22.744 --> 1:23:23.611
Just ask it.

1:23:25.947 --> 1:23:26.815
Go ahead.

1:23:31.220 --> 1:23:33.155
You can't have the kid

1:23:36.624 --> 1:23:39.161
unless you and I can come
to some kind of a agreement.

1:23:42.999 --> 1:23:44.632
Sheriff, you give me that boy

1:23:46.002 --> 1:23:47.769
and you can consider us even.

1:23:50.139 --> 1:23:51.007
Even?

1:23:52.141 --> 1:23:56.945
The whole debt, all of
it, like it never happened.

1:24:07.856 --> 1:24:09.591
I like that arrangement.

1:24:09.624 --> 1:24:11.626
Hmm, I bet you do.

1:24:14.330 --> 1:24:17.133
Just gonna need to
clear up some things

1:24:18.134 --> 1:24:18.967
with the boy's mother,

1:24:20.769 --> 1:24:22.871
but that won't be
any trouble for you.

1:24:22.904 --> 1:24:23.938
Oh, it best not.

1:25:29.371 --> 1:25:30.738
Hey, Stix.

1:26:00.702 --> 1:26:02.770
Hey, do me a favor.

1:26:02.804 --> 1:26:04.839
Handle this after I'm gone.

1:26:04.873 --> 1:26:06.808
I don't have the
stomach for this shit.

1:26:09.811 --> 1:26:10.945
I'll call Oliver
in Shreveport,

1:26:10.979 --> 1:26:13.082
let him know our debt's settled.

1:26:13.115 --> 1:26:16.051
You may not be able to visit
the casinos for a while though.

1:26:16.085 --> 1:26:17.919
Pleasure doing
business with you.

1:26:21.123 --> 1:26:23.758
Take the kid,
bring him to the barn.

1:26:23.791 --> 1:26:24.792
All right.

1:26:26.162 --> 1:26:27.762
Amigo.

1:26:34.303 --> 1:26:35.703
How old's your grandson?

1:26:36.905 --> 1:26:37.906
Four months old.

1:26:39.741 --> 1:26:41.010
They grow up fast.

1:26:49.485 --> 1:26:51.753
You, you fucking liar.

1:26:51.786 --> 1:26:52.421
You fuck.

1:26:56.925 --> 1:26:57.759
Hey!

1:26:57.792 --> 1:26:58.860
Hey, let me out, man!

1:27:00.529 --> 1:27:02.064
Boon, let me out!

1:27:04.366 --> 1:27:05.934
Boon!

1:27:05.967 --> 1:27:06.834
Boon!

1:27:09.171 --> 1:27:10.005
Boon!

1:27:10.039 --> 1:27:10.939
Boon, let me out.

1:27:12.274 --> 1:27:13.309
Fuck.

1:27:13.342 --> 1:27:14.343
Boon?

1:27:16.412 --> 1:27:19.181
What are you doing?

1:27:32.428 --> 1:27:33.462
Move back.

1:29:16.898 --> 1:29:17.566
Boon.

1:29:19.335 --> 1:29:21.103
Boon, this is it bro,

1:29:23.138 --> 1:29:25.140
I'm gonna get to retire.
