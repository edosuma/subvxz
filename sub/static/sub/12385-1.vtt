03:00.848 --> 03:02.765
Will you look at that fellow over there?

03:02.850 --> 03:05.852
I have never seen anything so disgusting
in all my life.

03:05.936 --> 03:09.021
I'll tell you something.
He's staring at you.

03:09.106 --> 03:11.732
I think he's looking at us.

03:11.817 --> 03:14.068
- I think we're being picked up.
- Oh, it's too awful.

03:14.152 --> 03:15.862
Can you believe it?

03:15.946 --> 03:18.364
I don't know how they can let
creatures like that in here.

03:19.148 --> 03:20.199
Really.

03:21.243 --> 03:22.952
Are you okay?

03:35.549 --> 03:37.550
Anne, what's the matter?

03:39.636 --> 03:41.637
Oh, help, someone, please!

04:11.585 --> 04:14.629
Ma'am. She's gonna be all right.
It's all right. Just stand back.

04:14.713 --> 04:16.422
- Help.
- Stand back. Give her air.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.254
Damn it!

06:02.988 --> 06:06.073
You're 35 years old, Mr. Vale.

06:07.367 --> 06:11.620
Why are you such a derelict...

06:11.705 --> 06:14.790
such a piece of human junk?

06:16.543 --> 06:18.878
The answer's simple.

06:18.962 --> 06:22.631
You're a Scanner, but you don't realize it.

06:23.884 --> 06:28.137
And that has been the source
of all your agony.

06:29.347 --> 06:31.849
But I will show you now...

06:31.933 --> 06:34.810
that it can be a source of great power.

06:41.777 --> 06:44.028
Let them in.

06:51.203 --> 06:53.954
Not much of a place, is it?

06:54.039 --> 06:56.749
Still, we're getting paid for it.

07:09.888 --> 07:11.972
Hurry up.

07:22.359 --> 07:23.943
Hurry up!

07:24.027 --> 07:26.028
He's kind of cute.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.462
We can talk now.

10:41.099 --> 10:45.894
I would like to scan all of you
in this room, one at a time.

10:45.979 --> 10:49.857
I must remind you that the scanning experience
is usually a painful one...

10:49.941 --> 10:52.318
sometimes resulting in nosebleeds...

10:52.402 --> 10:55.195
earaches, stomach cramps, nausea...

10:55.280 --> 10:58.240
sometimes other symptoms
of a similar nature.

10:58.325 --> 11:01.577
There's a doctor present - Dr. Gatineau.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.871
I know that you've all been prepared for this...

11:03.955 --> 11:07.041
but I thought I'd just remind you,
just the same.

11:07.125 --> 11:10.919
There is one other thing.
No one is to leave this room...

11:11.004 --> 11:13.672
once the demonstration has begun.

11:13.757 --> 11:16.759
At this point,
I'd like to call for volunteers.

11:22.057 --> 11:23.974
Anyone. It doesn't matter.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.650
Fine.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.660
Just, uh, sit right here, please.

11:53.546 --> 11:56.548
Now I'd like you to think
of something specific...

11:56.633 --> 11:59.802
something that will not breach
the security of your organization...

11:59.886 --> 12:02.763
and that you will not object
to having disclosed to this group.

12:02.847 --> 12:05.015
Something, uh, personal perhaps.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.558
All right.

12:07.644 --> 12:10.562
- Yes, I have something. Do I have to close my eyes?
- It doesn't matter.

12:11.648 --> 12:14.066
All right, yes, I have something.

13:30.226 --> 13:32.144
Move everybody out now!

13:32.812 --> 13:34.813
Call ConSec leader.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.319
- I want you to come with me.
- I didn't do anything.

13:40.403 --> 13:42.446
I said I want you to come with me.

13:44.490 --> 13:45.657
Come on.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.368
Gatineau, come with us.

13:57.295 --> 13:59.505
Oh, my God.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.507
Down there, quick.

14:02.467 --> 14:03.967
Move it!

14:05.970 --> 14:07.346
Get down.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.516
Give him a shot of Ephemerol.

14:10.600 --> 14:11.642
Come on!

14:51.516 --> 14:53.267
Okay.

15:09.284 --> 15:12.327
Take it easy. All we need
is to get stopped by a cop.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.329
It'd serve 'em right.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.999
Why the hell do they have
to send us to the old factory?

15:17.083 --> 15:20.711
If this guy's a Scanner,
they don't want him down at Central.

15:20.795 --> 15:22.421
They're afraid of him.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.465
He's a Scanner.

15:29.429 --> 15:32.431
Hey, where's Security Two?

15:32.515 --> 15:34.600
He's moving up fast on the left.

15:34.684 --> 15:36.643
Hey, man, what's happening?

15:40.356 --> 15:42.524
Ray, what the hell's the matter with ya?

15:45.528 --> 15:47.946
You gotta pull back behind him, man.

15:48.031 --> 15:49.448
Come on!

15:50.950 --> 15:54.036
Ray, I'm gonna kill you
if you don't do it.

15:57.624 --> 15:58.832
Ray!

16:04.464 --> 16:06.006
Oh, my God.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.883
Don't stop! Move it!

16:07.967 --> 16:10.385
No, we gotta get 'em outta there.

16:20.063 --> 16:21.730
Come on. We gotta get in there.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.774
- They're done, man. What are you -
- I can see he's burning!

16:23.858 --> 16:26.276
- Come on. Let go of me!
- Those people are dead.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.695
Get up.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.664
Let's get out of here, man! Come on!

16:38.748 --> 16:40.874
- You want to get us killed?
- All right. All right.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.459
- Quiet down.
- All right.

17:44.814 --> 17:47.315
Last night...

17:47.400 --> 17:51.069
we at ConSec chose to reveal
to the outside world...

17:51.154 --> 17:56.742
our work with those telepathic curiosities
known as Scanners.

17:56.826 --> 17:58.577
The result?

17:58.661 --> 18:01.163
Six corpses...

18:01.247 --> 18:06.334
and a substantial loss in credibility
for our organization.

18:06.419 --> 18:10.672
So this morning we have a new director
of Internal Security...

18:10.757 --> 18:12.007
Mr. Braedon Keller.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.967
Thank you.

18:14.051 --> 18:16.970
Mr. Trevellyan, gentlemen...

18:17.054 --> 18:19.139
we're in the business of international security.

18:19.223 --> 18:22.559
We deal in weaponry and private armies.

18:22.643 --> 18:27.230
We do not trade in fantasy and pipe dreams.

18:27.315 --> 18:30.859
Let us leave the development
of dolphins and freaks...

18:30.943 --> 18:33.487
as weapons of espionage to others.

18:33.571 --> 18:37.741
Now, with all due respect to Dr. Paul Ruth...

18:37.825 --> 18:42.204
I recommend that we drop
our Scanner program immediately, sir.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.540
Dr. Ruth, what's your response?

18:46.793 --> 18:49.377
Mr. Keller, who composed our audience last night?

18:49.462 --> 18:55.050
We had 25 financial and political V.I.P.s
from all over North America.

18:55.134 --> 18:58.345
Were these V.I.P.s carefully screened?

18:58.429 --> 19:01.389
The screening process used
was very sophisticated, yes.

19:01.474 --> 19:05.519
And yet an assassin managed
to infiltrate this group.

19:07.980 --> 19:08.980
Yes.

19:09.065 --> 19:10.899
And killed six of our people.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.359
Yes.

19:12.443 --> 19:14.194
How did he kill them?

19:14.278 --> 19:19.533
We have reason to believe he...
used scanning techniques.

19:19.617 --> 19:22.661
Then do you suggest, Mr. Keller...

19:22.745 --> 19:26.540
that this highly skilled assassin, very deadly...

19:26.624 --> 19:31.002
who embarrassed us all in front of the community
we were trying to impress...

19:31.087 --> 19:32.754
was himself a Scanner?

19:32.839 --> 19:35.090
We believe so, yes.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.634
Well, that, gentlemen, is my response.

19:37.718 --> 19:42.264
The weapons capability of these,
uh, telepathic, uh -

19:42.348 --> 19:44.683
Curiosities?

19:45.810 --> 19:47.185
is obvious.

19:47.270 --> 19:49.938
If I may, Doctor...

19:50.022 --> 19:52.607
your program is based on a list of...

19:52.692 --> 19:55.360
236 known Scanners, is it not?

19:55.444 --> 19:56.653
It is.

19:57.864 --> 20:01.116
Of that number - Of that number...

20:01.200 --> 20:03.201
how many are now working with us?

20:03.286 --> 20:05.912
As of last night, none.

20:07.081 --> 20:08.748
Well, then...

20:08.833 --> 20:11.668
we don't even have a program to drop, do we?

20:11.752 --> 20:13.962
It shouldn't be very painful for anyone.

20:14.046 --> 20:18.466
ConSec's surveillance has gradually lost contact
with all the names on our list...

20:18.551 --> 20:21.636
and I submit that this -
this is not an accident.

20:21.721 --> 20:25.640
I think we've lost them
to a program far in advance of ours.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.978
I think you might elaborate, Dr. Ruth.

20:30.062 --> 20:33.481
From my study of the situation,
I've come to the conclusion...

20:33.566 --> 20:37.444
that there is a Scanner underground
developed in North America.

20:37.528 --> 20:41.156
It has an organization, it's well-motivated,
and it has a leader.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.658
Now that's ridiculous, Doctor.
You can't get two of them...

20:43.743 --> 20:47.162
to sit in the same room together
without going berserk.

20:47.246 --> 20:51.249
You're making a very provocative allegation, Dr. Ruth.

20:51.334 --> 20:53.627
Who controls this group?

20:53.711 --> 20:56.504
If you study the descriptions
in this report...

20:56.589 --> 20:59.925
you will find that you probably
met him last night.

21:01.010 --> 21:04.679
His name is Darryl Revok...

21:04.764 --> 21:06.431
and he was on our list.

21:06.515 --> 21:08.141
This is total fiction. Mr. Trevellyan, I -

21:08.225 --> 21:11.561
Just a moment, Mr. Keller.
What do you suggest, Doctor?

21:13.731 --> 21:15.732
Eliminate the competition.

21:15.816 --> 21:17.651
How?

21:17.735 --> 21:21.279
Contact a Scanner who is, as yet,
unknown to the underground...

21:21.364 --> 21:23.531
convert him to our cause...

21:23.616 --> 21:27.827
and then send him out
to infiltrate the underground.

21:27.912 --> 21:29.621
Convert him, Doctor? How?

21:29.705 --> 21:33.875
They're all pathetic social misfits.
Unstable, unreliable.

21:33.960 --> 21:37.879
That is because their unique gifts
are not understood, Mr. Keller.

21:37.964 --> 21:41.424
There is one point about which
there is no doubt at all.

21:41.509 --> 21:44.552
And that is that ConSec was attacked.

21:44.637 --> 21:48.390
For our own peace of mind,
we have to retaliate in some way.

21:49.141 --> 21:53.395
And I think Dr. Ruth's suggestion
is a very interesting one.

21:53.479 --> 21:57.107
Except that...

21:57.191 --> 22:00.610
we don't have any Scanners left
to send into the field.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.697
As a matter of fact...

22:03.781 --> 22:05.740
I do have one...

22:05.825 --> 22:08.576
still unaffiliated.

22:09.870 --> 22:11.705
A very special one.

22:25.094 --> 22:27.721
I don't suppose you speak much.

22:28.556 --> 22:30.056
No.

22:30.766 --> 22:33.059
It's not surprising.

22:33.144 --> 22:36.938
With all those other voices in your head,
how can you hear your own voice?

22:37.023 --> 22:40.692
How can you develop a self, a personality?

22:41.819 --> 22:43.820
How do you feel?

22:45.448 --> 22:47.949
I feel... crystal clear.

22:51.203 --> 22:54.205
How do you like it - clarity?

22:57.043 --> 22:58.793
I'm not sure.

22:59.754 --> 23:02.380
- I think I'm a bit afraid.
- Why?

23:06.302 --> 23:08.887
I feel so exposed.

23:08.971 --> 23:10.638
I can hear myself.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.766
You hear your own voice?

23:12.850 --> 23:14.768
- Yes.
- Good.

23:14.852 --> 23:17.228
You called me a Scanner.

23:17.980 --> 23:20.023
What is that?

23:21.692 --> 23:23.276
A freak of nature...

23:23.360 --> 23:27.072
born with a certain form of E.S.P.

23:27.948 --> 23:31.409
A derangement of the synapses...

23:31.494 --> 23:33.244
which we call telepathy.

23:35.831 --> 23:39.667
Could be a disease, possibly,
or a result of radiation.

23:39.752 --> 23:42.462
We don't really know why.

23:45.341 --> 23:47.550
Who are you?

23:49.303 --> 23:51.846
My name is Dr. Paul Ruth.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.681
I'm a psychopharmacist by trade...

23:53.766 --> 23:57.477
specializing in the phenomenon of Scanners.

24:01.357 --> 24:05.318
The woman in the shopping mall.
What were you doing to her?

24:06.278 --> 24:08.363
I wasn't doing anything to her.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.448
It was her.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.368
She was...

24:14.328 --> 24:15.870
forcing me -

24:16.580 --> 24:18.331
<i>To what?</i>

24:19.458 --> 24:21.000
<i>To think about her.</i>

24:23.129 --> 24:25.964
<i>The 50 people that were in this room,
they appeared to disturb you.</i>

24:26.048 --> 24:29.759
- <i>Why was that?</i>
- <i>They talked too loud.</i>

24:29.844 --> 24:32.470
- <i>They talked, and they talked.</i>
- <i>Really?</i>

24:32.555 --> 24:35.557
<i>I didn't see their lips move. Did you?</i>

24:35.641 --> 24:38.852
<i>No, it was the other voices.
The ones without lips.</i>

24:38.936 --> 24:40.687
<i>They were drowning me.</i>

24:41.814 --> 24:43.940
I couldn't stop them.

24:45.484 --> 24:48.069
The injection we gave you, with the needle -

24:48.154 --> 24:50.572
What happened to the voices?

24:50.656 --> 24:51.906
They stopped.

24:51.991 --> 24:56.578
The drug is called Ephemerol.

24:56.662 --> 24:59.080
It's a scan suppressant.

24:59.165 --> 25:02.333
It does nothing when it's given
to ordinary human beings.

25:02.418 --> 25:07.463
When given to a Scanner,
it prevents the flow of telepathy.

25:07.548 --> 25:10.216
It stops the voices.

25:10.301 --> 25:12.802
It can help you.

25:12.887 --> 25:15.013
How do you know these things?

25:15.097 --> 25:16.806
It's my profession.

25:40.289 --> 25:42.916
This is Mr. Keller.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.293
Will my car be ready this evening?

25:51.717 --> 25:54.219
<i>Tell us what you did, please, Darryl.</i>

25:55.721 --> 25:58.097
- <i>I drilled a hole in my head.</i>
- <i>Where?</i>

25:58.182 --> 26:00.642
<i>It's kind of obvious, isn't it?</i>

26:00.726 --> 26:01.935
<i>Right here.</i>

26:03.270 --> 26:06.397
<i>Why did you do it, Darryl?
Why did you drill the hole?</i>

26:07.650 --> 26:10.151
<i>Too much pressure.</i>

26:10.236 --> 26:11.861
<i>I had to let some pressure out.</i>

26:11.946 --> 26:14.030
<i>You wanted to let the pressure out.</i>

26:14.114 --> 26:16.658
<i>You wanted to let something
out of your head?</i>

26:19.994 --> 26:21.287
<i>Lillian, so smart.</i>

26:21.372 --> 26:23.790
<i>Can't get anything past Lillian.</i>

26:23.874 --> 26:26.251
<i>You wanted to let something
out of your head.</i>

26:27.753 --> 26:29.337
<i>What?</i>

26:29.421 --> 26:30.463
<i>People.</i>

26:34.051 --> 26:37.136
<i>People in my head.
Not enough room for Darryl.</i>

26:37.221 --> 26:39.555
<i>You mean voices?</i>

26:39.640 --> 26:44.644
<i>No. Whole people. Arms, legs, hands.</i>

26:44.728 --> 26:47.855
- <i>What's that you've put over the hole?</i>
- <i>It's a door.</i>

26:47.940 --> 26:50.441
<i>I put an eye on the door
so they won't know it's a door...</i>

26:50.526 --> 26:53.194
<i>and they can't get back in,
'cause they'll see the eye, you know.</i>

26:53.279 --> 26:55.405
<i>Do you think that will fool them?</i>

26:58.993 --> 27:01.077
<i>Sure. Sure it will.</i>

27:01.161 --> 27:03.538
- <i>I mean -</i>
- <i>I mean, sure it will, you know.</i>

27:03.622 --> 27:07.375
- <i>I mean, if that's the only way -</i>
- <i>No!</i>

27:07.459 --> 27:09.294
<i>What do you know?</i>

27:09.378 --> 27:11.421
<i>You don't know nothin', do ya?</i>

27:11.505 --> 27:13.548
<i>Wanna see how they get in? Really?</i>

27:13.632 --> 27:15.550
<i>You wanna see how they get in?</i>

27:17.428 --> 27:18.511
<i>Do ya?</i>

27:42.828 --> 27:44.912
<i>Good afternoon, Darryl.</i>

27:44.997 --> 27:47.665
- <i>Hello, Darryl.</i>
- <i>Get your hands off me.</i>

27:47.750 --> 27:49.584
<i>Get your hands -</i>

27:49.668 --> 27:52.045
<i>Get your hands off me!</i>

27:52.129 --> 27:54.172
<i>Get your hands off me!</i>

28:12.524 --> 28:14.484
That's me, isn't it?

28:15.361 --> 28:19.113
As you were, without Ephemerol...

28:19.198 --> 28:20.865
without guidance.

28:22.368 --> 28:24.077
Is he still like that?

28:25.120 --> 28:27.663
- Worse.
- How could he be?

28:27.748 --> 28:30.917
At the age of 22,
he was extremely self-destructive.

28:31.001 --> 28:35.505
Now, at the age of 35,
he is simply destructive.

28:35.589 --> 28:40.093
In many ways, Cameron, he is your enemy.

28:40.969 --> 28:42.512
And mine.

28:43.806 --> 28:45.765
But I don't even know him.

28:45.849 --> 28:49.268
He... knows you.

28:52.815 --> 28:55.149
Somehow he was able to gather...

28:55.234 --> 28:58.653
a master list of all the Scanners
who were ever born.

28:58.737 --> 29:01.322
He has sought them out one by one...

29:01.407 --> 29:04.784
asked them to join him
in an insane crusade...

29:04.868 --> 29:07.745
to destroy the society that created him.

29:08.372 --> 29:10.623
And me?

29:10.707 --> 29:14.252
He was looking for you, but I found you first.
That's why you can help me.

29:14.336 --> 29:16.045
I don't understand.

29:17.089 --> 29:18.631
All the Scanners...

29:18.715 --> 29:20.675
who didn't agree to join him were murdered.

29:20.759 --> 29:24.929
These murders represent a loss to mankind...

29:25.013 --> 29:27.265
of the most spectacular human beings...

29:27.349 --> 29:29.976
that ever walked the face of this planet.

29:30.060 --> 29:33.146
Now you, Cameron,
and your brothers and sisters...

29:33.230 --> 29:37.108
can bring a - a glory
and a brilliance to our society...

29:37.192 --> 29:38.901
that has never been seen before.

29:40.362 --> 29:43.865
We must stop Revok now.

30:30.037 --> 30:33.581
ConSec are not ready to give up their program.

30:34.958 --> 30:38.794
Paul Ruth came up with a secret weapon.

30:38.879 --> 30:40.755
What?

30:40.839 --> 30:43.674
Someone you've been looking for, I think.

30:43.759 --> 30:47.053
A Scanner. Calls himself Cameron Vale.

30:50.182 --> 30:52.058
I've seen him.

30:52.142 --> 30:54.810
And Ruth knew exactly where to find him.

30:55.854 --> 30:58.356
He's in indoctrination right now.

31:00.442 --> 31:02.860
Can he do anything?
What kind of shape is he in?

31:04.530 --> 31:06.656
He seems to function...

31:07.574 --> 31:09.700
but he's nothing to worry about.

31:10.244 --> 31:11.786
He's weak.

31:12.663 --> 31:14.997
Very weak.

31:17.292 --> 31:21.379
Welcome to our little psychic gymnasium.

31:23.507 --> 31:25.299
Cameron Vale.

31:29.012 --> 31:34.767
And please meet yoga master Dieter Tautz.

31:37.813 --> 31:40.648
Mr. Tautz has kindly consented...

31:40.732 --> 31:44.777
to be your psychic sparring partner.

31:44.861 --> 31:49.657
He has publicly demonstrated on many occasions...

31:49.741 --> 31:53.119
that by the power of his will
he can control his...

31:53.203 --> 31:56.789
heart rate, his alpha wave rhythm...

31:56.873 --> 32:02.295
and many other supposedly
uncontrollable functions of the human body.

32:02.379 --> 32:04.338
- Are we ready?
- Just about.

32:04.423 --> 32:06.716
Proceed.

32:06.800 --> 32:10.469
If you would be kind enough
to sit facing this gentleman here.

32:16.435 --> 32:18.519
I want you -

32:21.773 --> 32:25.693
I want you to slowly release your scan -

32:25.777 --> 32:28.029
slowly, with focus.

32:29.698 --> 32:32.575
I want it to touch his heart...

32:32.659 --> 32:35.244
but not his brain, understand?

32:36.913 --> 32:39.081
Telepathy is not mind reading.

32:39.166 --> 32:42.043
It is the direct linking...

32:42.127 --> 32:47.214
of two nervous systems separated by space.

32:48.467 --> 32:52.303
I want you to make a link...

32:53.847 --> 32:58.726
from your brain to his heart.

32:58.810 --> 33:02.897
I want your brain to make his heart...

33:04.650 --> 33:06.067
beat fast.

33:07.486 --> 33:12.740
Now, if his heart beats too quickly...

33:12.824 --> 33:16.035
then he will take over control of his heart...

33:16.119 --> 33:18.621
and slow it down.

33:20.290 --> 33:23.125
Don't worry about him.

33:23.210 --> 33:25.628
All you have to do...

33:26.505 --> 33:30.216
is make his heart beat faster.

33:31.700 --> 33:32.885
Fast.

33:33.969 --> 33:35.596
Fast.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.139
Fast.

33:38.934 --> 33:40.434
Fast.

33:41.353 --> 33:42.353
Fast.

33:43.689 --> 33:44.730
Fast.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.233
Fast.

33:47.317 --> 33:48.025
Fast.

33:49.945 --> 33:52.030
Fast.

34:05.460 --> 34:06.794
End your scan.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.214
End it.

34:12.967 --> 34:14.969
Stop him.

34:15.053 --> 34:16.388
End it!

34:17.472 --> 34:19.514
End it.

34:35.157 --> 34:37.074
You were right, Dr. Ruth.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.453
It was easy.

34:42.914 --> 34:47.543
This man's name is Benjamin Pierce.

34:47.627 --> 34:51.297
And these photographs
were taken in a prison for the...

34:51.380 --> 34:54.300
criminally insane.

34:56.386 --> 34:58.929
Here's another one.

34:59.014 --> 35:04.143
This is a plaster cast of him,
at present on display at the Crostic Art Gallery.

35:05.812 --> 35:08.063
He's our only lead.

35:08.148 --> 35:12.860
A known Scanner who may, or may not, 
be part of Revok's underground.

35:14.738 --> 35:16.489
Why was he in prison?

35:18.033 --> 35:20.534
He tried to kill his entire family.

35:21.828 --> 35:25.164
His father, his sister, mother.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.875
At the age of 10.

35:27.959 --> 35:31.545
It was in 1958.
A few years later, he was, uh, released.

35:31.630 --> 35:34.298
Uh, what do they say here?

35:36.718 --> 35:39.303
"Rehabilitation through art."

36:10.460 --> 36:13.420
The man has incredible power, doesn't he?

36:13.505 --> 36:15.756
Power?

36:16.541 --> 36:18.342
Yes, he does.

36:18.426 --> 36:19.927
I am Arno Crostic.

36:20.011 --> 36:23.013
I'm pleased you came to my gallery.

36:24.641 --> 36:27.560
Are you an aficionado of Benjamin Pierce?

36:27.644 --> 36:31.605
I'm interested in buying this piece
for my apartment in Paris.

36:31.690 --> 36:34.024
- Yes?
- But I don't think it'll work out...

36:34.109 --> 36:36.443
unless I can get to meet the artist first.

36:38.530 --> 36:40.447
I'm afraid, no.

36:40.532 --> 36:45.452
I hope it won't prejudice you
against acquiring this piece...

36:45.537 --> 36:48.622
but I would lose Benjamin Pierce for good...

36:48.707 --> 36:51.500
if I even approached him with the idea.

36:51.585 --> 36:54.753
You see, it's part of our agreement.

36:54.838 --> 36:57.965
He will not meet his public.

36:58.049 --> 37:01.302
Maybe you could just tell me where he lives.

37:01.386 --> 37:03.596
Then I could approach him myself...

37:03.680 --> 37:05.598
and you wouldn't be involved.

37:05.682 --> 37:08.225
I'm afraid I can't.

37:10.186 --> 37:15.649
Then maybe you could just think
about where he lives.

37:15.734 --> 37:17.401
Excuse me.

37:19.446 --> 37:22.072
I'm suddenly feeling ill.

37:34.961 --> 37:37.254
Arno. What's the matter?

37:39.841 --> 37:41.550
- Are you all right?
- I will be all right.

37:41.635 --> 37:43.552
Come on, Arno.
Let me take you back to your office.

37:43.637 --> 37:45.512
- You've gotta lie down.
- Okay.

37:45.597 --> 37:47.598
That's it. Take my arm.

39:04.342 --> 39:06.260
Benjamin Pierce?

39:06.344 --> 39:08.846
Why don't you leave me alone?

39:19.065 --> 39:20.816
I need some help.

39:20.900 --> 39:22.818
You're the only one
that could give it to me.

39:24.446 --> 39:26.572
Is that right?

39:26.656 --> 39:27.614
Me?

39:27.699 --> 39:29.116
Yes.

39:41.129 --> 39:44.506
Then I think you're in big trouble, chum.

39:54.100 --> 39:56.518
I've heard you know a man
named Darryl Revok.

40:03.151 --> 40:05.152
Who are you?

40:22.921 --> 40:27.800
I was told you were coming
to pay me a visit, Mr. Vale.

40:28.593 --> 40:30.928
How did you know that?

40:31.763 --> 40:33.972
How did I know that? Well -

40:35.100 --> 40:37.226
I have friends.

40:39.395 --> 40:41.688
I don't want them...

40:41.773 --> 40:43.524
but I have them.

40:49.906 --> 40:52.116
Scanner friends?

40:56.704 --> 40:58.705
What do you mean by that?

40:58.790 --> 41:00.415
I'm one of you.

41:02.210 --> 41:04.545
- You're one of me.
- Yes.

41:13.555 --> 41:15.222
You know what I think?

41:15.306 --> 41:18.934
I think you better tell me
what you really want.

41:28.236 --> 41:31.071
It's the voices in my head.

41:31.156 --> 41:33.907
They're driving me crazy.

41:33.992 --> 41:35.576
How do you stop them?

41:35.660 --> 41:38.162
Your voices?

41:43.293 --> 41:45.127
My art.

41:46.880 --> 41:50.674
My art keeps me sane.

41:54.012 --> 41:55.721
My art.

41:57.932 --> 41:59.266
Sane.

42:00.560 --> 42:02.436
I don't have anything like this.

42:02.520 --> 42:05.439
That's why I have to find Darryl Revok.

42:09.944 --> 42:11.486
You...

42:12.238 --> 42:14.031
my friend...

42:15.116 --> 42:16.783
are a liar.

42:20.038 --> 42:21.872
- Get out.
- Look -

42:21.956 --> 42:25.918
I'm not leaving here until you tell me
where I can find Darryl Revok.

42:28.004 --> 42:29.254
No?

42:30.048 --> 42:31.340
All right.

42:31.424 --> 42:33.133
Well, then, I'll get out.

43:01.913 --> 43:04.623
No!

44:36.299 --> 44:38.216
<i>Not Revok.</i>

44:38.301 --> 44:40.135
<i>Not Revok.</i>

44:40.219 --> 44:44.890
<i>His army's robots, killers.</i>

44:44.974 --> 44:47.434
<i>They'll turn you into a zombie...</i>

44:47.518 --> 44:50.187
<i>a robotic killer.</i>

44:50.271 --> 44:53.398
<i>No. Not - Not Revok.</i>

44:53.483 --> 44:55.108
<i>There are others.</i>

44:55.193 --> 44:57.778
<i>Other Scanners.</i>

44:57.862 --> 44:59.363
<i>Kim Obrist.</i>

44:59.447 --> 45:02.282
<i>Kim Obrist.</i>

45:02.367 --> 45:05.577
<i>Kim Obrist.</i>

45:24.222 --> 45:27.307
Good evening, sir. Can I help you?

45:27.392 --> 45:30.435
- Are there any messages for me?
- Your name, sir?

45:30.520 --> 45:33.146
- Cameron Vale.
- And your room number?

45:33.231 --> 45:34.731
802.

45:36.067 --> 45:38.235
Yes, this package is for you, sir.

47:35.895 --> 47:39.314
My name is Cameron Vale.
I've got to talk to Kim Obrist.

47:39.982 --> 47:41.608
Come on in.

47:52.870 --> 47:55.330
Oh, God.

47:55.414 --> 47:57.290
They killed Ben Pierce.

47:57.375 --> 47:58.917
Yes.

47:59.752 --> 48:01.795
Come on upstairs.

48:17.311 --> 48:19.312
Just wait here a second.

48:21.941 --> 48:24.734
Kim, Revok got to Ben Pierce. He's dead.

48:24.819 --> 48:27.028
This guy's name is Cameron Vale.

48:27.905 --> 48:30.448
I scanned him. He's for real.

48:30.533 --> 48:32.951
He was there when it happened.

48:41.502 --> 48:43.503
Sit down.

48:53.598 --> 48:55.765
I know you.

48:55.850 --> 48:58.351
You were at the gallery.

48:58.436 --> 49:00.437
You were looking for Pierce.

49:01.272 --> 49:03.440
I need help.

49:46.984 --> 49:49.069
<i>Scan together.</i>

49:49.153 --> 49:53.657
<i>Scan together, and our minds
begin to flow into each other...</i>

49:53.741 --> 49:56.076
<i>until they become one mind.</i>

49:56.160 --> 49:58.870
<i>One nervous system.</i>

49:58.954 --> 50:00.580
<i>One soul.</i>

50:01.207 --> 50:03.541
<i>One experience.</i>

50:03.626 --> 50:04.626
<i>Beautiful.</i>

50:04.710 --> 50:07.921
- <i>Beautiful.</i>
- <i>Beautiful and frightening.</i>

50:08.005 --> 50:09.464
<i>And frightening.</i>

50:27.358 --> 50:30.443
<i>So frightening to lose yourself.</i>

50:30.528 --> 50:32.987
<i>So frightening to lose yourself.</i>

50:33.072 --> 50:35.198
<i>To lose your will to the group will.</i>

50:35.282 --> 50:38.576
<i>To lose yourself to the group self.</i>

50:48.337 --> 50:49.496
No!

50:55.803 --> 50:57.637
<i>The power.</i>

50:57.722 --> 51:03.143
<i>The power we can generate
when we focus our scans together is fantastic.</i>

51:03.227 --> 51:07.313
- <i>Terrifying.</i>
- <i>Terrifying. Exhilarating.</i>

51:20.202 --> 51:22.746
<i>...must dissolve...</i>

52:03.788 --> 52:05.747
No. Around the side, quick!

52:05.831 --> 52:07.332
Hurry.

52:10.544 --> 52:12.045
Get in!

52:14.381 --> 52:16.341
Let's go! Drive!

52:20.638 --> 52:22.263
Kim?

52:23.432 --> 52:25.975
Kim. Kim, come on.

52:26.060 --> 52:27.228
Kim!

52:30.898 --> 52:33.191
Now I know...

52:33.275 --> 52:35.360
what it feels like to die.

52:37.071 --> 52:39.239
Everywhere you go, somebody dies.

52:39.323 --> 52:42.408
Who are you? Who sent you?

52:42.493 --> 52:45.620
- I'm a Scanner.
- Who sent you?

52:45.704 --> 52:47.664
I was found by ConSec.

52:47.748 --> 52:49.165
ConSec?

52:49.250 --> 52:51.626
They wanted me to find Revok.

52:51.710 --> 52:54.212
I think they want to kill him.

52:54.296 --> 52:56.589
But they never told me about you.

53:12.106 --> 53:14.107
Tony!

53:15.859 --> 53:17.277
Tony!

53:57.735 --> 53:59.152
Tony!

54:01.572 --> 54:03.281
Oh, no!

54:06.827 --> 54:09.412
Come on.
We gotta get out of here.

54:27.222 --> 54:28.890
Come on.

54:36.230 --> 54:37.357
Excuse me.

54:37.441 --> 54:39.108
Sorry, ma'am.

54:39.193 --> 54:40.693
Excuse me. Outside, ma'am.

54:40.778 --> 54:43.780
Okay. Let's move out.
There's nothing here to see.

54:43.864 --> 54:45.949
- Go back to the street.
- Let's go, let's go.

54:46.033 --> 54:47.867
Hey! Come on. There's nothing here.

54:49.452 --> 54:51.287
<i>Back out, back out.</i>

55:00.213 --> 55:02.048
Oh, it's on fire!

55:02.132 --> 55:05.051
Get out of my way!

55:05.135 --> 55:06.886
Let's get out of here.

55:08.171 --> 55:10.306
Get out of my way!

56:05.863 --> 56:08.281
We'll be all right here for a while.

56:09.365 --> 56:10.992
It doesn't matter.

56:12.036 --> 56:13.494
It's finished...

56:14.496 --> 56:17.165
and nothing can stop Revok now.

56:18.608 --> 56:20.293
We were the dream...

56:20.377 --> 56:22.378
and he's the nightmare.

56:29.720 --> 56:32.722
There's still us. I can help you.

56:34.099 --> 56:36.017
We can destroy Revok together.

56:36.401 --> 56:37.602
You?

56:39.104 --> 56:40.605
You're barely human.

56:49.531 --> 56:51.032
I'm sorry.

56:52.910 --> 56:56.079
I'm sorry, but you don't understand.

56:56.163 --> 56:57.997
You don't know Revok.

56:58.082 --> 57:00.666
You don't know how evil he is,
how powerful he is.

57:00.751 --> 57:02.710
You don't know anything.

58:05.357 --> 58:06.858
What are you doing?

58:07.818 --> 58:10.444
He must have something
that will lead us to Revok.

58:11.488 --> 58:13.614
Us? No, not m -

58:20.664 --> 58:22.165
There it is.

58:24.459 --> 58:26.502
That's it.

58:27.504 --> 58:29.005
That's it.

01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:33.814
Dr. Ruth. Telephone call, sir.

01:01:33.899 --> 01:01:35.858
Take it right here.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.700
Yes?

01:01:44.785 --> 01:01:46.702
<i>It's Cameron Vale.</i>

01:01:48.997 --> 01:01:50.539
We've missed you.

01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:53.751
I made a breakthrough to Revok.

01:01:53.835 --> 01:01:57.671
I wanna come in. I wanna bring you
an informant from Revok's group.

01:01:58.799 --> 01:02:00.674
That's excellent.

01:02:00.759 --> 01:02:03.844
I'll arrange for you to be brought in.

01:02:03.929 --> 01:02:06.430
Can - Can you call me back
in about 10 minutes?

01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:10.559
Okay. Good-bye, Dr. Ruth.

01:02:17.317 --> 01:02:19.068
All set?

01:02:19.152 --> 01:02:21.070
Ten minutes.

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:48.013
We may have developed a serious problem.

01:02:49.099 --> 01:02:52.226
Vale's coming in.
He says he has an informant from your group.

01:02:52.310 --> 01:02:54.562
Now, is that possible?

01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:58.065
No, he's lying.

01:02:59.234 --> 01:03:01.902
Then why is he coming in?

01:03:01.987 --> 01:03:03.654
Maybe he's homesick.

01:03:03.738 --> 01:03:06.782
Look, Vale must know something,
or his informant does.

01:03:06.867 --> 01:03:08.784
It could be about me and you.

01:03:08.869 --> 01:03:12.163
Then you'd better be the one
to interrogate the informant.

01:03:12.247 --> 01:03:15.458
And Ruth will talk to Vale.
I won't be able to prevent that.

01:03:15.542 --> 01:03:19.044
If Ruth finds out anything,
anything at all...

01:03:19.129 --> 01:03:20.629
kill him.

01:03:23.175 --> 01:03:24.884
Really?

01:03:25.968 --> 01:03:27.178
I thought you didn't want Ruth -

01:03:27.262 --> 01:03:29.430
Kill him. Really.

01:03:40.442 --> 01:03:43.777
ConSec Central, this is ConSec Two-Niner.
Are we clear to land?

01:03:44.779 --> 01:03:47.406
<i>ConSec Two-Niner, this is ConSec Central.</i>

01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:49.658
<i>Security's in place.
You are clear to land.</i>

01:03:49.743 --> 01:03:51.660
<i>Repeat. Affirmative to land.</i>

01:04:48.552 --> 01:04:52.221
I'm afraid I'm going to have to give you both
an injection of Ephemerol.

01:04:53.306 --> 01:04:54.974
Well, Braedon?

01:04:55.058 --> 01:04:57.142
No apologies, no vote of confidence.

01:04:57.227 --> 01:05:00.020
And my man brought back the goods.

01:05:00.105 --> 01:05:03.482
Why don't we save the party
until we've unwrapped the presents, Doctor?

01:05:03.567 --> 01:05:07.236
It won't take long.
I-I have a way with these creatures.

01:05:08.405 --> 01:05:09.856
I know that.

01:05:11.241 --> 01:05:13.576
So does Trevellyan.

01:05:16.371 --> 01:05:19.123
That's why he's asked me
to take the informant.

01:05:19.207 --> 01:05:21.417
You can do what you like with Vale.

01:05:21.501 --> 01:05:23.586
But that won't work.

01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:27.840
Police state tactics simply won't work, sir.

01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:29.383
Really?

01:05:29.467 --> 01:05:32.845
Why don't you send a letter to the board
about that, Doctor?

01:05:32.929 --> 01:05:35.264
I'm sure they'd love to hear from you.

01:05:42.271 --> 01:05:43.439
Come in.

01:05:47.611 --> 01:05:49.111
Welcome.

01:05:50.113 --> 01:05:51.614
Congratulations.

01:05:52.657 --> 01:05:55.034
It's good to have you back home.

01:05:55.118 --> 01:05:57.161
Where's the girl? She should be here.

01:05:57.245 --> 01:05:59.747
She's in another room being interrogated.

01:06:01.416 --> 01:06:03.167
I thought it would be you.

01:06:03.251 --> 01:06:04.752
So did I.

01:06:04.836 --> 01:06:07.671
That's why I made sure that
the needles I gave you both were harmless.

01:06:07.756 --> 01:06:11.550
Don't worry. She'll be able to protect herself
if there's any problem.

01:06:11.635 --> 01:06:13.469
Why did you do that?

01:06:13.553 --> 01:06:17.640
A gesture of trust, dear friend.

01:06:18.767 --> 01:06:21.393
I have my own methods...

01:06:21.478 --> 01:06:23.520
and I have nothing to hide.

01:06:23.605 --> 01:06:25.606
Nothing at all to hide.

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:29.735
Not even the Ripe program?

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:31.320
The what?

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:37.660
Do you know of a drug laboratory
called Biocarbon Amalgamate?

01:06:38.578 --> 01:06:40.245
Why, yes, of course.

01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:42.915
I founded it in 1942.

01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:45.626
You?

01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:48.087
I sold it to ConSec.
That's why I'm here.

01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:51.840
Let's say that we have a, uh...

01:06:51.925 --> 01:06:55.552
genial working relationship.

01:06:56.763 --> 01:06:58.555
Do you know what that lab does?

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:01.934
It's been so long since
I've been in touch with them.

01:07:02.018 --> 01:07:07.272
As far as I know, they - they make
some sort of chemical weaponry...

01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:09.108
among other things.

01:07:09.192 --> 01:07:12.861
It manufactures Ephemerol for Darryl Revok.

01:07:12.946 --> 01:07:16.865
It may even be run by Darryl Revok.

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:18.742
That's impossible.

01:07:19.577 --> 01:07:22.371
No. I was there.

01:07:22.455 --> 01:07:25.082
I took the place of one of Revok's men.

01:07:26.084 --> 01:07:28.085
I saw Revok in the control room.

01:07:30.046 --> 01:07:33.132
The production of Ephemerol is computerized.

01:07:34.426 --> 01:07:38.679
It's being manufactured
and sent out in huge tankers.

01:07:39.848 --> 01:07:42.224
Ephemerol has been sent out?

01:07:48.273 --> 01:07:50.816
Sent out where?

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:53.485
The answer is in your own computer.

01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:57.781
The program that controls everything
is called Ripe...

01:07:57.866 --> 01:07:59.867
and it's a ConSec program.

01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:05.664
That means that someone...

01:08:05.749 --> 01:08:07.416
here at ConSec...

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:09.668
is a traitor.

01:08:09.753 --> 01:08:12.755
And that someone is working with Revok.

01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:19.428
I want you to access the Ripe program.

01:08:19.511 --> 01:08:22.890
I do not have ConSec computer clearance.

01:08:24.475 --> 01:08:26.018
Neither do I.

01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:28.187
But you do have a nervous system...

01:08:29.229 --> 01:08:30.814
and so does a computer.

01:08:32.817 --> 01:08:36.653
And you can scan the computer...

01:08:36.738 --> 01:08:38.822
as you would...

01:08:38.907 --> 01:08:40.698
another human being.

01:08:44.245 --> 01:08:45.703
Come.

01:09:04.182 --> 01:09:05.682
Hello.

01:09:06.684 --> 01:09:07.935
Hello.

01:09:11.314 --> 01:09:13.357
What a pleasant surprise.

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:17.944
You're very attractive.

01:09:20.156 --> 01:09:22.991
Okay. Let's do it the formal way.

01:09:24.618 --> 01:09:27.120
- Your name?
- Kim Obrist.

01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:31.959
Your name?

01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:34.169
Not relevant.

01:09:39.133 --> 01:09:41.468
Now...

01:09:41.553 --> 01:09:44.930
tell me everything you know
about Darryl Revok's organization.

01:09:45.765 --> 01:09:48.475
Before I tell you anything...

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:50.769
I wanna know how you're gonna protect me.

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:55.274
When Revok finds out that I've come here...

01:09:56.401 --> 01:09:58.068
he's gonna try and kill me.

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:04.658
Miss Obrist, your best protection...

01:10:06.494 --> 01:10:09.288
is to tell us everything we need to know.

01:10:09.372 --> 01:10:10.914
As soon as you do...

01:10:10.999 --> 01:10:14.835
Revok will cease to be a threat to anyone.

01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:19.923
Not good enough.

01:10:21.593 --> 01:10:23.552
Revok's people are everywhere...

01:10:25.346 --> 01:10:27.097
and that scares me.

01:10:28.725 --> 01:10:30.851
To be honest with you, Kim...

01:10:32.395 --> 01:10:35.939
the only one you should be afraid of is me.

01:10:37.483 --> 01:10:39.109
Why should I be afraid of you?

01:10:40.069 --> 01:10:42.404
I came here of my own free will.

01:10:50.747 --> 01:10:52.247
Because...

01:10:54.417 --> 01:10:57.002
I know you're not what you say you are.

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:02.841
I wanna see someone else.

01:11:06.596 --> 01:11:08.096
Listen to me! Listen to me.

01:11:11.184 --> 01:11:13.560
Now, I have acquaintances in Revok's group.

01:11:13.645 --> 01:11:16.271
They tell me -

01:11:16.356 --> 01:11:19.566
They tell me that you have
never been one of them.

01:11:21.402 --> 01:11:24.112
Why are you here?

01:11:28.826 --> 01:11:30.327
Why?

01:11:41.673 --> 01:11:44.049
Good-bye, Kim.

01:12:22.839 --> 01:12:25.257
It must be Kim. Where is she?

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:27.759
Where is she?

01:12:27.844 --> 01:12:30.262
- This is more important.
- No!

01:12:34.642 --> 01:12:38.979
<i>No. This is more important.</i>

01:12:39.063 --> 01:12:41.982
<i>The computer is more important.</i>

01:12:42.066 --> 01:12:44.359
<i>Access the Ripe program.</i>

01:12:44.444 --> 01:12:45.944
<i>More important.</i>

01:12:48.531 --> 01:12:51.616
<i>But the Ripe program is the past.</i>

01:12:51.701 --> 01:12:54.745
<i>Therefore, to access the Ripe program...</i>

01:12:54.829 --> 01:12:57.789
<i>is to access the past, no?</i>

01:12:57.874 --> 01:13:00.751
<i>Access the past.</i>

01:13:00.835 --> 01:13:03.962
<i>Access the past.</i>

01:13:07.675 --> 01:13:09.176
Security!

01:13:15.141 --> 01:13:18.060
Scanners - find them and kill them.
Put it on the air!

01:13:20.396 --> 01:13:22.439
Find them and kill them.

01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:32.657
It mustn't happen again.

01:13:33.743 --> 01:13:36.161
It's always been there inside me...

01:13:36.245 --> 01:13:37.954
lurking away...

01:13:38.039 --> 01:13:41.583
sucking out my joy, rotting my successes.

01:13:44.087 --> 01:13:46.171
Cameron.

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:48.340
Oh, Cameron.

01:13:48.424 --> 01:13:50.967
I have a way with you, Cameron.

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:56.348
Mustn't happen again.

01:13:58.059 --> 01:14:00.268
Ripe.

01:14:00.353 --> 01:14:02.229
Ripe, indeed.

01:14:05.108 --> 01:14:07.901
The Ripe program must be stopped!

01:14:14.117 --> 01:14:16.284
This isn't the same thing, you understand.

01:14:16.369 --> 01:14:18.537
Not the same thing at all.

01:14:18.621 --> 01:14:20.122
It's different.

01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:23.959
The first time was an accident.

01:14:24.752 --> 01:14:27.420
Fortunate for some.

01:14:27.505 --> 01:14:29.464
Unfortunate for others.

01:14:33.803 --> 01:14:37.472
The Ripe program is cold and cruel.

01:14:41.477 --> 01:14:42.978
Very...

01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:47.023
very cold.

01:14:51.946 --> 01:14:53.488
Very cruel.

01:15:39.368 --> 01:15:41.411
- What happened?
- Keller tried to kill me.

01:15:41.495 --> 01:15:43.455
Keller?

01:15:43.539 --> 01:15:45.373
Then he's the one.

01:15:57.553 --> 01:15:59.638
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:16:09.232 --> 01:16:12.651
<i>Mom, what are you doing here?</i>

01:16:16.447 --> 01:16:17.948
<i>I'm sorry, Mom!</i>

01:16:19.867 --> 01:16:21.993
<i>Mom! I didn't -</i>

01:16:22.078 --> 01:16:25.413
<i>I-I - I didn't mean it!</i>

01:16:30.044 --> 01:16:31.294
<i>Mom.</i>

01:16:33.589 --> 01:16:36.216
- <i>I didn't mean it, Mom.</i>
- <i>Blood on my hands.</i>

01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:37.759
<i>Please.</i>

01:16:38.844 --> 01:16:41.012
There's blood on my hands.

01:16:41.097 --> 01:16:43.265
Secure the computer room!

01:16:43.349 --> 01:16:44.851
Blood on my hands.

01:16:46.936 --> 01:16:48.853
What's going on?

01:16:50.398 --> 01:16:53.024
What the hell is going on?

01:16:53.109 --> 01:16:55.694
It's the Scanners, sir. They're out.

01:17:21.721 --> 01:17:23.555
Is this the only way we can do it?

01:17:23.639 --> 01:17:27.142
If we don't plug into the computer now,
they're gonna reprogram it.

01:17:48.289 --> 01:17:49.998
What does that mean?

01:17:50.082 --> 01:17:52.751
It means that someone
has reprogrammed the computer in such a way...

01:17:52.835 --> 01:17:54.919
that the Ripe program is locked away inside.

01:17:55.004 --> 01:17:57.964
Somebody not only threw away the key,
he plugged the keyhole.

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:02.218
Try it again. Try it again.

01:18:02.303 --> 01:18:03.887
Okay.

01:18:20.363 --> 01:18:22.280
That's as deep into it as we're gonna get.

01:18:22.365 --> 01:18:26.117
Hey, Lee. Punch up your internal monitor.

01:18:26.202 --> 01:18:28.328
Access is IM 863.

01:18:28.412 --> 01:18:30.080
Why, what is it?

01:18:30.164 --> 01:18:33.166
Someone's inside this thing right now
getting the Ripe program.

01:18:46.597 --> 01:18:48.681
How can this happen?

01:18:48.766 --> 01:18:51.643
This room is max security.

01:18:51.727 --> 01:18:53.937
We're plugged into the telephone system.

01:18:54.021 --> 01:18:58.316
Anybody who has the proper series of access codes
could get in here long-distance.

01:19:00.236 --> 01:19:02.737
- You mean someone's getting that right now?
- Yeah.

01:19:04.782 --> 01:19:06.116
Damn!

01:19:45.281 --> 01:19:46.781
It's him.

01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:50.410
It's Vale. He's inside.

01:19:50.494 --> 01:19:52.579
- Is that possible?
- It's gotta be.

01:19:54.457 --> 01:19:56.666
It's gotta be. I wanna hurt him.

01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:59.127
How can we hurt him before he gets out?

01:19:59.211 --> 01:20:00.879
Hurt him? I-I don't understand.

01:20:00.963 --> 01:20:05.133
Vale's nervous system and the computer's
nervous system are joined together.

01:20:05.217 --> 01:20:07.302
He's scanning it.

01:20:07.386 --> 01:20:10.180
I wanna cripple them both,
or maybe kill them both.

01:20:10.264 --> 01:20:11.723
How?

01:20:12.975 --> 01:20:16.394
Well, I don't know if it's what you want...

01:20:16.479 --> 01:20:19.647
but I could override
the max security self-destruct.

01:20:19.732 --> 01:20:22.901
It's designed to blow all the circuits
in case of anticipated possession of data...

01:20:22.985 --> 01:20:25.069
by unauthorized and unfriendly forces.

01:20:25.154 --> 01:20:26.154
Do it now.

01:20:26.238 --> 01:20:28.740
But, sir, that would entail
a total loss of all data...

01:20:28.824 --> 01:20:30.909
all programs within the ConSec system.

01:20:30.993 --> 01:20:34.078
I couldn't do that without
the written authorization of ConSec leader.

01:20:35.164 --> 01:20:37.040
Mister, this is your authorization.

01:20:37.124 --> 01:20:38.625
Sit down!

01:20:45.299 --> 01:20:47.592
Do it now, or I'll kill you.

01:20:48.469 --> 01:20:49.928
Yes, sir, I'm doing it now.

01:21:19.667 --> 01:21:21.793
Sir, I have to finish it over there.

01:21:50.406 --> 01:21:52.365
Sir, this is the last step. Are you sure -

01:21:52.449 --> 01:21:53.950
Do it!

01:22:08.674 --> 01:22:11.009
There's no need for that.

01:22:11.093 --> 01:22:13.928
It's all very quiet.
It's just internal switching.

01:22:16.056 --> 01:22:18.391
Really?

01:22:18.475 --> 01:22:21.394
No one's ever switched off a Scanner before.

01:23:05.481 --> 01:23:07.190
Oh, shit!

01:23:10.152 --> 01:23:11.819
See?

01:23:11.904 --> 01:23:14.030
I told ya, no fireworks.

01:25:19.782 --> 01:25:21.657
Hey, I'll go find the doctor.

01:25:21.742 --> 01:25:23.951
All right.
I'll keep an eye on the door.

01:25:36.799 --> 01:25:40.051
Excuse me. Do you know
if the receptionist is coming back soon?

01:25:40.835 --> 01:25:42.094
Yeah, I guess so.

01:25:42.179 --> 01:25:43.679
Thanks.

01:26:25.264 --> 01:26:27.515
Please, I'll be with you in a few moments.

01:26:27.599 --> 01:26:29.350
I have to talk to you right now, Doctor.

01:26:29.434 --> 01:26:32.395
Would you please get out of here?

01:26:34.314 --> 01:26:36.649
It's about this drug, Dr. Frane.

01:26:38.819 --> 01:26:41.821
I understand you've been
prescribing it to some patients.

01:26:44.241 --> 01:26:45.741
Excuse me.

01:26:45.826 --> 01:26:48.244
I'll be back in just a moment.

01:26:49.079 --> 01:26:51.747
Just relax. Read a magazine.

01:26:59.464 --> 01:27:03.384
Where did you get this?
What do you want with me? Who are you?

01:27:08.724 --> 01:27:10.808
What happened?

01:27:10.893 --> 01:27:13.185
I was scanned.

01:27:14.605 --> 01:27:17.773
The woman in the - in the waiting room.

01:27:18.734 --> 01:27:20.234
She scanned you?

01:27:21.403 --> 01:27:23.070
No, not her.

01:27:24.531 --> 01:27:26.032
Her child.

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:31.370
Her unborn child scanned me.

01:27:33.206 --> 01:27:34.916
That's what the Ripe program is.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.335
The doctors on the computer list...

01:27:37.419 --> 01:27:40.963
are giving Ephemerol to their pregnant patients.

01:27:41.048 --> 01:27:43.382
- I don't understand!
- Ephemerol!

01:27:44.551 --> 01:27:47.011
Ephemerol is creating new Scanners.

01:27:50.891 --> 01:27:52.725
- Hold still.
- Oh, God!

01:27:52.809 --> 01:27:54.518
- Hold still.
- Oh, God.

01:27:56.203 --> 01:27:58.189
Okay. Okay.

01:27:58.273 --> 01:28:01.150
- Oh, my God. Oh, God!
- Come on. Let's get out of here.

01:28:03.779 --> 01:28:05.863
Okay. Come on.

01:28:07.866 --> 01:28:10.993
Come on!
You can make it. Come on!

01:28:12.955 --> 01:28:14.997
Kim. Kim!

01:28:15.082 --> 01:28:16.874
Vale.

01:28:42.275 --> 01:28:43.776
Kim.

01:28:45.195 --> 01:28:46.904
Sleeping Beauty awakes.

01:28:48.865 --> 01:28:50.700
Where's Kim?

01:28:52.119 --> 01:28:53.911
The next room.

01:28:53.996 --> 01:28:56.998
She'll be awake in a few hours.

01:28:57.082 --> 01:28:59.583
We don't want anyone in here with us.

01:29:00.961 --> 01:29:03.546
This is just between you and me.

01:29:03.630 --> 01:29:07.049
Where's your partner Keller?
He should be here.

01:29:07.134 --> 01:29:09.343
Keller?

01:29:09.428 --> 01:29:12.555
Seems he died when you blew up his computer.

01:29:12.639 --> 01:29:14.765
And by the way, that was very impressive.

01:29:16.435 --> 01:29:18.769
Keller murdered Dr. Ruth.

01:29:18.854 --> 01:29:20.604
He deserved to die.

01:29:22.589 --> 01:29:24.108
You shouldn't mourn
the good doctor's death.

01:29:24.192 --> 01:29:25.860
You should celebrate it with me.

01:29:25.944 --> 01:29:29.071
Dr. Ruth was a great man.

01:29:29.156 --> 01:29:31.115
He tried to help us.

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:32.700
He helped me.

01:29:32.784 --> 01:29:36.162
"Great man."
There's only one person on earth...

01:29:36.246 --> 01:29:38.289
who ever tried to help you, and that's me!

01:29:38.373 --> 01:29:39.707
You?

01:29:39.791 --> 01:29:42.126
- You sent your soldiers out to kill me.
- Never.

01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:44.295
Never you.

01:29:44.379 --> 01:29:46.255
I've spent years looking for you.

01:29:46.339 --> 01:29:49.091
And then when Keller told me
that Ruth had dressed you up...

01:29:49.176 --> 01:29:51.385
and sent you out
as some ridiculous amateur spy...

01:29:51.470 --> 01:29:54.972
I tried to take care of you,
look after you...

01:29:55.057 --> 01:29:56.682
guide you to me.

01:29:59.352 --> 01:30:02.354
Now, why would you try to do that?

01:30:03.899 --> 01:30:05.816
Who's your mother?

01:30:07.611 --> 01:30:09.570
I don't know.

01:30:12.824 --> 01:30:15.826
- Who's your father?
- I don't know.

01:30:15.911 --> 01:30:18.496
What was your first childhood memory?

01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:20.372
I don't have any.

01:30:20.457 --> 01:30:24.293
No, you don't.
And it's no accident that you don't.

01:30:24.377 --> 01:30:26.003
You were kept on ice.

01:30:26.088 --> 01:30:30.591
It wasn't until ConSec had trouble
putting me away that they thawed you out.

01:30:30.675 --> 01:30:32.968
You've been monitored
every day of your life...

01:30:33.053 --> 01:30:36.180
allowed to live like garbage, scum.

01:30:36.264 --> 01:30:38.891
He knew where you were,
but it wasn't until he needed you...

01:30:38.975 --> 01:30:41.936
that he reached down
and hauled you up out of the slime.

01:30:42.020 --> 01:30:43.020
Who?

01:30:44.606 --> 01:30:47.858
Your father, Dr. Paul Ruth.

01:30:53.281 --> 01:30:55.491
Our father.

01:30:59.162 --> 01:31:00.663
No.

01:31:02.249 --> 01:31:04.542
You're my brother, Cameron.

01:31:04.626 --> 01:31:06.377
My kid brother.

01:31:07.587 --> 01:31:09.046
No.

01:31:16.304 --> 01:31:18.139
Sit down. I want to show you something.

01:31:28.608 --> 01:31:32.403
This was a test campaign
used in 1947 to market a new product.

01:31:32.487 --> 01:31:35.614
The product was a drug,
a tranquilizer called Ephemerol.

01:31:37.409 --> 01:31:39.869
It was aimed at pregnant women.

01:31:39.953 --> 01:31:43.205
If it had worked, it would have been
marketed all over North America.

01:31:43.290 --> 01:31:45.958
But the campaign failed,
and the drug failed...

01:31:46.042 --> 01:31:48.502
because it had a side effect
on the unborn children...

01:31:48.587 --> 01:31:50.838
an invisible side effect.

01:31:52.674 --> 01:31:54.341
It created Scanners.

01:31:54.426 --> 01:31:56.218
Yes.

01:31:56.303 --> 01:31:58.220
The man who invented Ephemerol...

01:31:58.305 --> 01:32:01.015
was very excited
by this weird mutation it caused...

01:32:01.099 --> 01:32:02.808
and so was ConSec.

01:32:02.893 --> 01:32:06.020
They offered to finance his experiments...

01:32:06.104 --> 01:32:09.440
so he sold them his company and himself.

01:32:10.984 --> 01:32:13.277
And that man was Dr. Ruth.

01:32:13.361 --> 01:32:16.071
That was Daddy.

01:32:16.156 --> 01:32:20.201
Now, I said that
the side effects of Ephemerol were invisible.

01:32:20.285 --> 01:32:22.203
But that's not completely true.

01:32:22.287 --> 01:32:25.247
Daddy could see them.
He could see them in us.

01:32:26.333 --> 01:32:28.125
He had given the prototype of Ephemerol...

01:32:28.210 --> 01:32:30.211
to his pregnant wife, our mother...

01:32:30.295 --> 01:32:33.380
four years before it hit the market,
and then again a year later.

01:32:34.633 --> 01:32:36.592
His children turned out to be difficult...

01:32:36.676 --> 01:32:39.386
till he realized that the only thing
that would calm them down...

01:32:39.471 --> 01:32:42.223
was his drug, Ephemerol.

01:32:44.017 --> 01:32:46.769
That's why we're older than all the others.

01:32:47.854 --> 01:32:51.315
Not only older, more powerful.

01:32:51.399 --> 01:32:54.985
The rest of them,
they're nothing compared to us.

01:32:55.070 --> 01:32:57.154
Then what did you need Keller for?

01:32:57.239 --> 01:33:01.784
ConSec had hardware. It had contacts.

01:33:01.868 --> 01:33:04.453
- Keller could see the future.
- The future?

01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:07.706
You murdered the future.

01:33:10.043 --> 01:33:13.337
That's negative, Cam. Defeatist.

01:33:13.421 --> 01:33:16.507
Disappoints me to hear you talk that way.

01:33:16.591 --> 01:33:19.176
You're starting to sound like them.

01:33:20.637 --> 01:33:22.554
There's a whole generation of Scanner soldiers...

01:33:22.639 --> 01:33:24.515
just a few months away from being born.

01:33:24.599 --> 01:33:27.101
We'll find them, train them to be like us.

01:33:27.185 --> 01:33:29.603
Not like Obrist and her band of cripples.

01:33:30.814 --> 01:33:33.023
We'll bring the world of normals to their knees.

01:33:33.108 --> 01:33:36.944
Rule an empire so brilliant, so glorious...

01:33:37.028 --> 01:33:38.821
we'll be the envy of the whole planet.

01:33:39.948 --> 01:33:42.116
You sound just like him.

01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:44.159
Like Ruth.

01:33:44.244 --> 01:33:46.704
No, not like him.

01:33:46.788 --> 01:33:49.665
Like Revok! Darryl Revok!

01:33:49.749 --> 01:33:54.253
No. Like him.

01:33:54.337 --> 01:33:57.006
It's as though he's been reincarnated in you.

01:34:00.218 --> 01:34:02.553
You're not listening to me.

01:34:05.473 --> 01:34:07.474
You're not cooperating, Cam.

01:34:07.559 --> 01:34:09.977
You're not cooperating with me at all.

01:34:17.193 --> 01:34:19.820
I've been counting on you for years, Cameron.

01:34:19.904 --> 01:34:22.614
Tell me you're not gonna betray me
like all the rest.

01:34:22.699 --> 01:34:25.075
Tell me you're not.

01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:26.535
No!

01:34:36.629 --> 01:34:39.256
All right.
We're gonna do it the Scanner way.

01:34:39.341 --> 01:34:41.383
I'm gonna suck your brain dry.

01:34:41.468 --> 01:34:44.053
Everything you are is gonna become me.

01:34:44.137 --> 01:34:46.180
You're gonna be with me, Cameron,
no matter what.

01:34:46.264 --> 01:34:50.434
After all, brothers should be close,
don't you think?

01:39:05.898 --> 01:39:07.649
Cameron?

01:39:07.734 --> 01:39:08.984
Kim?

01:39:15.825 --> 01:39:19.119
It's me, Kim. Cameron. I'm here.

01:39:22.123 --> 01:39:23.624
We've won.

01:39:25.793 --> 01:39:27.294
We've won.
