00:00.322 --> 00:02.620
This has one number on it - mine.

00:02.977 --> 00:04.696
I was given to a man called
Christos.

00:04.697 --> 00:06.218
He taught me how to steal,

00:06.295 --> 00:07.333
how to fight.

00:07.334 --> 00:09.493
They caught him,

00:09.494 --> 00:11.733
tortured him, killed him.

00:11.734 --> 00:14.333
What was my name?

00:14.334 --> 00:16.253
Your name was Pietre.

00:16.254 --> 00:17.293
Get out!

00:17.294 --> 00:19.733
Jesus Christ!

00:19.734 --> 00:21.094
It was chemical poisoning!

00:21.095 --> 00:22.413
Not flu at all!

00:22.414 --> 00:25.614
I have copies with lawyers.
I want Anya released.

00:25.615 --> 00:27.213
I need to see you.

00:27.214 --> 00:28.813
I'm in trouble.

00:28.814 --> 00:30.733
That's not me!

00:30.734 --> 00:31.773
That is not me!

00:31.774 --> 00:35.414
See if he's got the Chinese
character for "rabbit" on his belly.

00:35.415 --> 00:39.414
Then what, whack him?

00:39.654 --> 00:40.893
We go now!

00:40.894 --> 00:42.294
And we take him with us.

00:42.295 --> 00:46.253
I want the manuscript
and you are going to take me to it.

00:46.254 --> 00:49.493
Of course.

00:49.494 --> 00:51.293
That's why I'm here.

01:34.654 --> 01:38.654
Do you have it?

01:42.694 --> 01:45.333
What, no kiss first?

01:45.334 --> 01:48.413
So, you're getting tremors.

01:48.414 --> 01:52.414
It could be psychosomatic.
Or the Deel's could be activating.

01:54.294 --> 01:58.294
Thoraxin's an experimental drug,
it's hard to gauge its efficacy.

01:59.054 --> 02:00.492
Then why am I taking it?

02:00.493 --> 02:03.574
Because there's every chance it's
keeping you alive.

02:03.575 --> 02:07.173
You know, when Jessica handed
them the manuscript,

02:07.174 --> 02:09.173
she didn't give them it all.

02:09.174 --> 02:11.813
She ripped out a few pages.

02:11.814 --> 02:14.173
She must've given them to someone.

02:14.174 --> 02:15.493
Grant?

02:15.494 --> 02:18.613
Now, Becky, if you get me those
pages,

02:18.614 --> 02:22.172
I can get them to someone who can
help, someone who can expose this.

02:22.173 --> 02:23.852
How do you know she did that?

02:23.853 --> 02:25.814
I keep telling you, I know people!

02:25.815 --> 02:28.613
That's why you need to
stick with me.

02:28.614 --> 02:29.733
Hang on!

02:29.734 --> 02:32.133
I can always get you what you need.

02:32.134 --> 02:36.134
Where's the rest? That'll last me
a day or two, where's the rest?

02:37.134 --> 02:38.853
Get me those pages.

02:38.854 --> 02:42.854
If you want to keep
control of your fucking limbs.

03:01.054 --> 03:04.853
Got our supplies.
Have you seen Alice yet?

03:04.854 --> 03:08.854
Yeah, she's over there with Grant,
acting as if nothing happened.

03:10.412 --> 03:11.891
Is that the vaccine?

03:11.892 --> 03:15.892
You really think this kills people?

03:18.052 --> 03:20.251
What about Letts?

03:20.281 --> 03:21.420
Have you checked?

03:21.420 --> 03:24.019
No.

03:24.020 --> 03:28.020
We were waiting for you.

03:43.260 --> 03:47.260
Fancy a chat later, Grant? There's
something we need to talk about.

03:54.260 --> 03:57.619
How are you, Alice?
Do you want to talk?

03:57.620 --> 04:00.579
No, thank you, Becky. Do you?

04:00.580 --> 04:04.580
Well? Are we going to talk to him?

04:07.580 --> 04:09.139
Right, you do it.

04:10.164 --> 04:11.203
Why me?

04:11.204 --> 04:15.204
You're a bloke!

04:18.404 --> 04:20.483
It's not Mr Rabbit.

04:20.483 --> 04:24.484
Shit.

04:42.604 --> 04:44.403
The child...

04:44.404 --> 04:46.723
did she kill Monroe?

04:46.724 --> 04:49.363
Yes.

04:49.364 --> 04:51.763
Why were you going to see him?

04:51.764 --> 04:55.764
To warn him. I always... liked him.

04:56.764 --> 04:58.122
Could I have more water, please?

04:58.123 --> 05:00.364
Where were you taking the vaccine?

05:00.365 --> 05:02.843
To a laboratory. For testing.

05:02.844 --> 05:04.683
And you do that? Yourself?

05:04.776 --> 05:06.016
Well, I... am a scientist.

05:06.017 --> 05:09.935
Or is that just to stop anyone else
seeing what's in it?

05:09.936 --> 05:13.134
We know about the GCHN1 protein.
We know about Janus.

05:13.135 --> 05:15.014
Then why are you talking to me?

05:15.015 --> 05:17.896
Because we're curious to know which
race it is you want to murder.

05:21.136 --> 05:24.295
Is that what you think is going on?

05:24.296 --> 05:28.296
Are you laughing? Laughing, is it?

05:29.336 --> 05:30.415
Please...

05:30.416 --> 05:32.336
- Who is it this time?
- Please don't hurt me.

05:32.337 --> 05:33.495
The white ones?

05:33.496 --> 05:36.414
The brown ones?
Not the Jews' turn now, then?

05:36.415 --> 05:38.934
- We're not that!
- Yeah? See this eye?

05:38.935 --> 05:42.334
Your men pulled it
out of my head with a fucking spoon!

05:42.335 --> 05:44.176
And they killed my dad! Why?

05:44.177 --> 05:45.695
Wilson!

05:45.696 --> 05:47.094
Who have you lost, eh?

05:47.095 --> 05:51.096
She's lost someone, Alice has lost
her mum, who have you fucking lost?

05:51.656 --> 05:55.175
I want to know why they're
doing this!

05:55.176 --> 05:59.176
Wilson? Your name is Wilson?

06:01.416 --> 06:04.095
And you must be Ian.
And you're Becky.

06:04.096 --> 06:06.095
How do you know that?

06:06.096 --> 06:09.855
You were given a phone?

06:09.856 --> 06:13.655
It contains a tracking device.

06:13.656 --> 06:16.415
They know where you are.

06:16.416 --> 06:20.416
We always have.

06:20.736 --> 06:24.736
Oh, my God!
I've been abandoned.

06:45.056 --> 06:47.975
Does she want the child?

06:47.976 --> 06:50.055
Er, I don't know.

06:50.056 --> 06:52.215
I don't think so.

06:52.216 --> 06:54.975
The people who, er...

06:54.976 --> 06:57.296
employ her, I think it's caused
trouble.

06:57.297 --> 06:59.095
I'm sorry...

06:59.096 --> 07:00.655
Employ?!

07:00.656 --> 07:03.135
The people who employ her?

07:03.136 --> 07:04.854
You mean the pimps who trafficked
her?

07:04.855 --> 07:06.694
The filthy criminals who were
bribing us

07:06.695 --> 07:10.336
and who you gave our money to when
you wanted to fuck her?

07:10.337 --> 07:14.336
I can't even look at you!

07:16.976 --> 07:20.015
This, er...

07:20.016 --> 07:22.094
..thing you have over these people,

07:22.095 --> 07:23.496
will it make us safe?

07:23.497 --> 07:25.655
Yes, it makes us safe.

07:25.656 --> 07:27.415
Because we want a child.

07:27.416 --> 07:30.855
It's your child and it...

07:30.856 --> 07:33.135
Is it a boy or a girl?

07:33.136 --> 07:37.136
It's a boy.

07:38.976 --> 07:42.976
And he needs a home.

07:57.416 --> 07:59.815
I think I've found it.

07:59.816 --> 08:01.336
It's wired in the battery,

08:01.337 --> 08:04.055
so it transmits when the phone's
off.

08:04.056 --> 08:05.776
So Milner knows we're there?

08:05.777 --> 08:07.375
No. Hang on.

08:07.376 --> 08:09.735
I mean, are we sure?

08:09.736 --> 08:11.815
Does she know?

08:11.816 --> 08:13.856
- Of course she knew!
- Who gave her the phone?

08:13.857 --> 08:15.735
Ian, she's tracking us.

08:15.736 --> 08:18.494
They're not here cos they're waiting
for the manuscript.

08:18.495 --> 08:20.936
Doesn't make sense. She saved us,
got Grant off the hook.

08:20.937 --> 08:24.936
What's the point...?

08:26.496 --> 08:28.576
Have you felt any tingling yet?

08:28.577 --> 08:30.375
Tremors?

08:30.376 --> 08:33.616
I'd be grateful if you told me. I
worked so hard on Deel's.

08:33.616 --> 08:36.174
What's your blood pressure?

08:36.176 --> 08:40.054
I'm not after a fucking check-up!

08:40.056 --> 08:42.294
Why?

08:42.296 --> 08:43.775
Why'd you do this?

08:43.775 --> 08:46.894
We weren't interested in what
Deel's did to the subject.

08:46.895 --> 08:48.414
We just wanted to know if we could

08:48.415 --> 08:50.456
engineer a change that could be
passed on.

08:50.457 --> 08:51.815
And we did.

08:51.816 --> 08:54.215
As an experiment...

08:54.216 --> 08:55.975
it was a success.

08:55.976 --> 08:58.295
Success?

08:58.296 --> 09:00.775
Did you just...?

09:00.776 --> 09:04.015
My father died of this!

09:04.016 --> 09:07.975
I've done so many terrible things.

09:07.976 --> 09:10.375
But what we are doing is right.

09:10.376 --> 09:12.815
Did you... did you say right?

09:12.816 --> 09:15.535
Brown people, white people, Jews...

09:15.536 --> 09:19.536
I assume you're referring to
Carvel's supposed paper on eugenics.

09:20.536 --> 09:22.735
But Carvel was misunderstood.

09:22.736 --> 09:24.294
Yeah, just like Hitler.

09:24.295 --> 09:28.296
He wasn't talking about race, he
was talking about survival!

09:29.296 --> 09:31.614
We've now passed seven billion on
this planet.

09:31.615 --> 09:34.176
When I was born it was a little over
two.

09:34.177 --> 09:37.295
Food prices are rising, oil is
ending.

09:37.296 --> 09:39.336
When our resources end in 20 years,

09:39.337 --> 09:43.255
given everything that we know of our
species,

09:43.256 --> 09:47.256
do you really think we're going to
just share?

09:47.296 --> 09:49.696
So your answer to that is some kind
of genocide?

09:49.697 --> 09:50.735
No, it is not!

09:50.736 --> 09:54.335
It is not genocide.

09:54.336 --> 09:58.336
Our answer to this is Janus.

10:00.976 --> 10:03.574
Janus consists of a protein
and an amino acid.

10:03.575 --> 10:06.614
Independent of each other,
they're harmless.

10:06.615 --> 10:09.414
But when they're brought
together in the subject

10:09.415 --> 10:12.454
they act as a genetic trigger that
prevents chromosomal division.

10:12.455 --> 10:15.536
The cell targeted can no longer
replicate itself

10:15.537 --> 10:18.975
and is thereby rendered useless.

10:18.976 --> 10:22.375
The change is permanent.

10:22.376 --> 10:25.455
And hereditary.

10:25.456 --> 10:28.135
And which cells are targeted?

10:28.136 --> 10:32.136
Those that control fertility, Becky.

10:32.536 --> 10:34.655
The purpose of Janus

10:34.656 --> 10:38.656
is to sterilise...

10:39.296 --> 10:44.205
The purpose of Janus is to sterilise
the entire human race.

10:48.398 --> 10:49.598
They've got Letts?

10:49.599 --> 10:52.837
Yes. I believe Letts had
the vaccine with him.

10:52.838 --> 10:55.337
- What?
- No need for panic.

10:55.375 --> 10:58.454
Carvel's work is almost in
our hands.

10:58.455 --> 11:01.214
Let's not lose that by being rash.

11:01.215 --> 11:03.813
This civil servant of yours is
much more worrying.

11:03.814 --> 11:05.495
You've handled him badly.

11:05.496 --> 11:08.134
He now has the capacity to
expose us.

11:08.135 --> 11:12.135
He's a fucking civil servant,
I didn't expect him to take risks!

11:12.375 --> 11:13.935
Perhaps you should end him?

11:13.936 --> 11:16.214
He would have prepared for that.

11:16.215 --> 11:18.534
End him!

11:18.535 --> 11:21.854
Don't give me orders, do you
understand?

11:21.855 --> 11:24.653
I am a Minister, and I don't take
orders from you!

11:24.654 --> 11:26.855
I'll deal with him.
You need to deal with this.

11:26.856 --> 11:29.294
Deal with this?

11:29.295 --> 11:31.934
How?

11:31.935 --> 11:34.294
By getting Letts back.

11:34.295 --> 11:37.454
Back?

11:37.455 --> 11:41.455
Why on earth would we want him back?

11:42.535 --> 11:46.174
Janus effects
90-95% of the population,

11:46.175 --> 11:50.175
leaving only one in 20 fertile.

11:50.295 --> 11:53.915
We predict the population will
plateau at 500 million

11:53.964 --> 11:56.922
in just under 100 years.

11:56.923 --> 12:00.923
By then, normal breeding rates
should resume...

12:02.123 --> 12:05.282
..but on a planet that will feel...

12:05.283 --> 12:07.522
empty.

12:07.523 --> 12:08.963
You're fucking insane!

12:08.964 --> 12:12.122
To do nothing is insane!

12:12.123 --> 12:16.123
You accuse us of being genocidal.
Not acting is genocide.

12:19.403 --> 12:22.201
Where do you think your food
comes from, Ian?

12:22.202 --> 12:26.203
A third of the world's farmland is
now useless due to soil degradation,

12:27.283 --> 12:29.923
yet we keep producing more mouths
to feed.

12:29.924 --> 12:32.602
And what's your answer to that?

12:32.603 --> 12:34.161
Energy-saving light bulbs?

12:34.162 --> 12:36.401
But we're doing things.
We're changing things.

12:36.402 --> 12:39.283
Do you know the person who had
the greatest positive impact

12:39.284 --> 12:42.562
on the environment of this planet?

12:42.563 --> 12:46.562
Genghis Khan, because he massacred
40 million people.

12:46.563 --> 12:49.363
There was no one to farm the land,
forests grew back,

12:49.364 --> 12:52.922
carbon was dragged
out of the atmosphere.

12:52.923 --> 12:56.561
And had this 'monster'
not existed, there'd be another

12:56.562 --> 13:00.563
billion of us today jostling
for space on this dying planet.

13:02.363 --> 13:06.363
Yet Janus massacres no-one,
it's without violence.

13:08.123 --> 13:12.123
This is why you did this to me.

13:12.723 --> 13:14.643
This is why you killed my dad?

13:14.644 --> 13:17.242
It is.

13:17.243 --> 13:21.243
And there are a thousand other
crimes on my conscience.

13:22.643 --> 13:26.002
But do you know what I see, Wilson?

13:26.003 --> 13:29.162
A planet turned into a desert.

13:29.163 --> 13:33.163
A thousand million souls starving,
dying.

13:35.683 --> 13:39.683
And we can stop this. With Janus.

13:42.803 --> 13:46.202
Why are you telling us this?

13:46.203 --> 13:47.563
It's not just to save yourself,

13:47.564 --> 13:51.242
you could have said anything to
save yourself.

13:51.243 --> 13:53.401
What we have is an approximation.

13:53.402 --> 13:56.041
We are not Carvel,
we don't have his genius.

13:56.042 --> 13:59.281
We'll know within three months
whether a version of Janus works.

13:59.282 --> 14:01.603
Then we're poised to repeat
it across the globe...

14:01.604 --> 14:05.602
If it works.

14:05.603 --> 14:09.603
But there is one way of making sure.

14:10.363 --> 14:11.761
Get us the manuscript.

14:11.762 --> 14:13.163
You're asking us to help you?

14:13.164 --> 14:14.562
Not me. Humanity.

14:14.563 --> 14:17.161
All over the world people are
helping, good people.

14:17.162 --> 14:18.321
If we had the manuscript, we...

14:18.322 --> 14:19.761
Right, you need to stop talking.

14:19.762 --> 14:23.763
Not to do this is to condemn
billions to starvation and misery!

14:23.803 --> 14:25.641
We need to find out
if Milner's with them.

14:25.642 --> 14:27.563
If she's not, then we need to get
that vaccine to her.

14:27.564 --> 14:31.563
Why?

14:32.323 --> 14:36.323
I mean... what he's saying,
it... isn't that...

14:38.243 --> 14:40.562
..right?

14:40.563 --> 14:44.522
Right? Sterilising the human race?

14:44.523 --> 14:45.923
One in 20 will remain fertile.

14:45.924 --> 14:47.562
You shut up!

14:47.563 --> 14:50.081
We should we at least think
about it.

14:50.082 --> 14:52.563
No, Wilson, we should not fucking
think about it!

14:52.564 --> 14:56.563
We need to stop him, now!

15:15.403 --> 15:19.403
Cos if they are right,
and we stop them...

15:22.643 --> 15:24.643
..then what does that make us?

15:24.644 --> 15:27.362
Wilson, they killed your dad.

15:27.363 --> 15:30.482
They tortured you.

15:30.483 --> 15:34.483
That's who they are.

16:35.203 --> 16:39.203
You need to go there.

16:40.403 --> 16:43.523
There's no cameras but you will have
to uncuff me.

16:43.524 --> 16:47.523
Shut up.

16:56.323 --> 16:59.763
If you don't give the manuscript
to me I'll have no hesitation

16:59.764 --> 17:02.882
in shooting your ankles,
shins, knees.

17:02.883 --> 17:06.042
I will make you talk and if I have
to do it in there, I will.

17:06.044 --> 17:10.042
OK?

17:36.043 --> 17:38.162
What now?

17:38.163 --> 17:41.602
We talk to the man.

17:41.603 --> 17:44.002
Where?

17:44.003 --> 17:48.003
The counter.

17:54.483 --> 17:58.483
Eggs, beans, chips, sausage, bacon,
two toast and a cup of tea.

17:59.003 --> 18:02.922
You?

18:02.923 --> 18:06.923
Twice.

18:10.243 --> 18:11.603
You think this is funny?

18:11.604 --> 18:14.122
They'll be after us.

18:14.123 --> 18:15.642
We need to eat.

18:15.643 --> 18:16.683
Keep up strength.

18:16.684 --> 18:20.683
Rule number one, you know that.

18:20.803 --> 18:22.362
Don't worry.

18:22.363 --> 18:24.802
I always come here, they know me.

18:24.803 --> 18:26.242
It's my local.

18:26.243 --> 18:29.002
Eat. I bought it for you.

18:29.003 --> 18:33.003
It's good.

18:33.683 --> 18:36.642
It's nice to talk to you in person.

18:36.643 --> 18:39.962
I've always wanted to.

18:39.963 --> 18:43.642
I'm a fan.

18:43.643 --> 18:46.562
I've read the manuscript, Jessica.

18:46.563 --> 18:49.562
I know what
kind of man your father was.

18:49.563 --> 18:52.242
What about Christos?

18:52.243 --> 18:56.042
Did he love you?

18:56.043 --> 19:00.043
I think a child needs love.

19:02.243 --> 19:06.243
My name's...

19:09.043 --> 19:13.043
My name's Pieter.

19:16.363 --> 19:18.802
This is disgusting.

19:18.803 --> 19:22.803
Only a dog would eat this shit.

19:23.123 --> 19:26.722
It's slop.

19:26.723 --> 19:30.723
And it's a fucking roadside
cafe by the way.

19:31.403 --> 19:34.442
This is no-one's 'local'.

19:34.443 --> 19:38.443
They don't know you here at all.

19:39.203 --> 19:41.202
You're cranky.

19:41.203 --> 19:45.203
Do you get those dreams a lot,
Jessica?

19:45.643 --> 19:47.482
Finish...

19:47.483 --> 19:51.483
we are going.

19:53.243 --> 19:57.243
I need to go toilet.

20:04.603 --> 20:08.603
I need to do the other one.

20:16.443 --> 20:20.443
There might be some noises.

20:31.443 --> 20:33.163
You wanted to talk, Becky?

20:33.164 --> 20:37.163
Yeah, maybe later, Grant.

20:41.563 --> 20:45.563
The hardest thing is not knowing.
Isn't it?

20:45.763 --> 20:49.362
Constant question.

20:49.363 --> 20:53.363
Will today be the day it triggers?

20:53.923 --> 20:57.923
What will it feel like when my throat
closes for the last time?

20:58.003 --> 21:01.602
I could squeeze your neck so easy!

21:01.603 --> 21:04.202
Is the thoraxin working?

21:04.203 --> 21:06.723
Donaldson told us he was
supplying you.

21:06.724 --> 21:10.162
I thought you'd slept with him
for the thoraxin.

21:10.163 --> 21:11.802
But...

21:11.803 --> 21:14.001
now that I've met you,
Becky, now that I know you,

21:14.002 --> 21:17.963
I realise that it must have been
so much more complex than that.

21:17.964 --> 21:19.682
You don't know me.

21:19.683 --> 21:23.683
He wants to sell us the manuscript.

21:23.843 --> 21:27.362
But I would much rather it be
you that benefits.

21:27.363 --> 21:31.363
Get it to us and we'll take care
of you.

21:42.003 --> 21:46.003
We've got a plan.

21:55.243 --> 21:57.323
You want to take the vaccine
to Milner?

21:57.324 --> 21:58.802
Not to her.

21:58.803 --> 22:00.802
We'll leave it outside.

22:00.803 --> 22:02.162
You and me go in.

22:02.163 --> 22:04.683
We find out whose side she's on
and then we decide.

22:04.684 --> 22:07.122
You and me?

22:07.123 --> 22:08.323
What about Wilson?

22:08.324 --> 22:10.322
I want to...

22:10.323 --> 22:14.323
talk to Letts.

22:15.443 --> 22:17.762
What are you going to do?

22:17.763 --> 22:20.282
He's right at the heart of this.

22:20.283 --> 22:22.243
He must know the name of Mr Rabbit.

22:22.244 --> 22:24.122
What?

22:24.123 --> 22:26.323
No. I can't. We can't start doing
stuff like that.

22:26.324 --> 22:28.962
He's talking to save his own skin.

22:28.963 --> 22:31.122
He needs...

22:31.123 --> 22:33.162
persuading.

22:33.163 --> 22:34.722
Fuck.

22:34.723 --> 22:36.002
What...

22:36.003 --> 22:38.362
then why you?

22:38.363 --> 22:41.002
Because I know what it feels like.

22:41.003 --> 22:42.802
Take Alice and Grant.

22:42.803 --> 22:44.537
It's best they're out the house for
this.

23:02.573 --> 23:04.972
You stay here with the vaccine.

23:04.973 --> 23:08.973
OK?

23:13.573 --> 23:15.653
Are you sure this is
the right thing to do?

23:15.654 --> 23:17.772
No.

23:17.773 --> 23:20.212
Not really.

23:20.213 --> 23:22.612
What's the worst that could happen?

23:22.613 --> 23:24.572
She could kill us.

23:24.573 --> 23:27.332
Or hand us over to them,
to kill us.

23:27.333 --> 23:31.333
Or torture us.

23:38.205 --> 23:39.564
Jesus Christ!

23:39.565 --> 23:40.683
Did you break in?

23:40.684 --> 23:43.325
We tried to contact you.
You didn't answer.

23:43.326 --> 23:47.325
They're on to me, for Christ sake,
I can't just...

23:50.545 --> 23:51.865
It's not what you think.

23:51.948 --> 23:53.386
You knew?

23:53.387 --> 23:54.586
You're with them?

23:54.587 --> 23:57.506
It's not as simple as that.

23:57.507 --> 23:59.746
I'm working with them, yes.

23:59.747 --> 24:02.186
But I'm not on their side.

24:02.187 --> 24:03.347
How do you think I stay alive?

24:03.348 --> 24:05.346
Don't fucking move!

24:05.347 --> 24:07.226
Don't you move.

24:07.227 --> 24:09.146
You gave us away.

24:09.147 --> 24:11.225
Because I knew they'd do nothing.

24:11.226 --> 24:15.227
They are not interested in you, they
want the manuscript, they want...

24:17.627 --> 24:21.225
I was supposed to encourage you
to get it from Jessica

24:21.226 --> 24:23.307
and when you had it,
I was to hand you over.

24:23.308 --> 24:24.986
Jesus Christ!

24:24.987 --> 24:26.227
Which I'm not going to do.

24:26.228 --> 24:27.866
We trusted you.

24:27.867 --> 24:29.147
And you lied to us.

24:29.148 --> 24:32.906
Give us one good reason why
we should believe you now?

24:32.907 --> 24:36.066
One?

24:36.067 --> 24:40.067
One reason?

24:51.547 --> 24:54.826
This is Jake.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.626
My son.

24:57.627 --> 25:01.627
Yes, Becky, it's Deals.

25:02.947 --> 25:05.666
I told you about his father.

25:05.667 --> 25:09.387
Part of the investigation meant
going undercover at Corvert,

25:09.388 --> 25:13.026
where they gave him Deals.

25:13.027 --> 25:17.027
Just like your dad, Becky.

25:17.747 --> 25:21.306
Jake's triggered about 18
months ago.

25:21.307 --> 25:23.427
He's done remarkably well but...

25:23.428 --> 25:26.746
the last six months...

25:26.747 --> 25:30.706
It's just a matter of weeks now.

25:30.707 --> 25:34.707
Now do you believe me?

25:48.187 --> 25:51.466
So we can give you
the vaccine, then?

25:51.467 --> 25:53.427
I mean, you said if we had proof...

25:53.428 --> 25:55.866
We can't.

25:55.867 --> 25:58.986
They know about her.

25:58.987 --> 26:00.826
He's right.

26:00.827 --> 26:03.706
What I did for Ian alerted them.

26:03.707 --> 26:06.467
I understand they are coming for me
tonight.

26:06.468 --> 26:08.506
It's OK.

26:08.507 --> 26:11.707
I've got Jake this far,
he won't mind going now.

26:11.708 --> 26:13.226
I have, erm...

26:13.227 --> 26:17.227
I have something we can take.

26:17.507 --> 26:19.586
Jesus Christ...

26:19.587 --> 26:21.265
What do we do with the vaccine?

26:21.266 --> 26:23.147
Ian, they are going to kill her.

26:23.148 --> 26:27.147
There's a man at the Department
of Health...

26:27.227 --> 26:30.066
Michael Dugdale.

26:30.067 --> 26:34.067
MI5 routinely monitors advisers
and his behaviour has been...

26:34.787 --> 26:37.146
I think he's with us.

26:37.147 --> 26:39.986
Get the vaccine to him.

26:39.987 --> 26:42.626
I think he might be on our side.

26:42.627 --> 26:45.026
No, I mean... You've got to run!

26:45.027 --> 26:47.306
Jake can't run

26:47.307 --> 26:49.906
and I'm not leaving him.

26:49.907 --> 26:53.907
Jake and I would like a few
moments on our own before...

26:54.787 --> 26:58.787
Best to go out the way you came in.

27:20.627 --> 27:24.627
Look, I'll take it to this guy.
You better get back to Wilson.

27:24.707 --> 27:26.626
I'll take Grant.

27:26.627 --> 27:29.546
He's bound to recognise him.

27:29.547 --> 27:33.547
I suppose I better take Alice, too.

27:33.667 --> 27:37.066
Becky...

27:37.067 --> 27:39.586
You don't know it's triggered.

27:39.587 --> 27:43.587
That may never be you.

28:00.147 --> 28:01.866
How's Jen?

28:01.867 --> 28:03.306
Devastated.

28:03.307 --> 28:05.346
But still alive?

28:05.347 --> 28:07.185
Look, I'm trying to protect you.

28:07.186 --> 28:08.585
What we did to you last night

28:08.586 --> 28:10.827
was the start of an unimaginable
nightmare.

28:10.828 --> 28:14.386
Stop being so stupid, you are tiny.

28:14.387 --> 28:18.387
If I give you what I have,
you'll kill me.

28:20.067 --> 28:21.667
So I'm going to keep it.

28:21.668 --> 28:24.786
And you're going to buy my silence.

28:24.787 --> 28:27.426
350,000 every year.

28:27.427 --> 28:30.987
Make it look like a trust fund
from some unknown aunt.

28:30.988 --> 28:34.987
That way, I'll have an incentive
to keep quiet.

28:36.107 --> 28:38.866
This...

28:38.867 --> 28:42.186
..might be acceptable.

28:42.187 --> 28:45.066
And I want Anya
out of prison today.

28:45.067 --> 28:49.067
Jen and I want to meet
with her this afternoon.

28:50.387 --> 28:54.387
As you wish.

28:54.987 --> 28:58.987
This might turn out nicely
after all.

29:03.067 --> 29:04.986
It's not easy, is it?

29:04.987 --> 29:08.987
Growing up without a childhood.

29:09.347 --> 29:11.707
I was brought up in an institution.

29:11.708 --> 29:14.306
My room was a cell, really.

29:14.307 --> 29:17.306
There was an air-vent there.

29:17.307 --> 29:21.307
I drew pictures around it,
faces to keep the devil out.

29:23.627 --> 29:27.627
I was told I'm like this
because of early trauma.

29:28.707 --> 29:31.626
I disconnected.

29:31.627 --> 29:35.346
A beneficial side effect,
I suppose.

29:35.347 --> 29:38.226
I know this place.

29:38.227 --> 29:41.586
It was me.

29:41.587 --> 29:44.626
I killed Christos.

29:44.627 --> 29:47.466
I tied him to that tree.

29:47.467 --> 29:49.906
I broke arms and fingers,

29:49.907 --> 29:52.826
tore the skin from his body.

29:52.827 --> 29:55.386
And in the end...

29:55.387 --> 29:57.786
I opened his stomach,

29:57.787 --> 30:01.787
reached inside and pulled out
what was in my hand.

30:05.867 --> 30:09.867
I was 15 years old.

30:11.827 --> 30:15.426
But he didn't say one word.

30:15.427 --> 30:18.266
He didn't speak.

30:18.267 --> 30:21.986
He didn't say where you were.

30:21.987 --> 30:25.706
That's how much he loved you.

30:25.707 --> 30:29.707
I wanted you to know that
you were loved.

30:29.747 --> 30:33.747
Because I wasn't.

30:35.027 --> 30:38.666
You can kill me now
and get revenge for Christos

30:38.667 --> 30:41.906
or I can take you to the manuscript.

30:41.907 --> 30:45.907
I can take you to what's
left of your father.

30:47.747 --> 30:51.747
But I won't do
it at the point of a gun.

30:52.787 --> 30:56.787
You have to trust me.

30:57.227 --> 31:00.306
Throw away the gun.

31:00.307 --> 31:02.266
Or it stops...

31:02.267 --> 31:06.267
here.

31:12.707 --> 31:14.425
I don't need a gun to kill you.

31:14.426 --> 31:18.427
The minute you hand it over, I will
rip the life from your body!

31:41.987 --> 31:45.987
Wilson...

31:46.107 --> 31:47.987
Wilson, what have you got there?

31:47.988 --> 31:51.987
Wilson, I thought I detected...

31:52.027 --> 31:54.267
..a certain sympathy with our views

31:54.268 --> 31:57.386
and you wouldn't be alone.

31:57.387 --> 32:00.225
Wilson, please, please.
Please don't do...

32:00.226 --> 32:02.265
Do you want money?
I'll give you money.

32:02.266 --> 32:04.027
I'll give you whatever you want.

32:04.028 --> 32:06.346
Wilson, please, don't do it.

32:06.347 --> 32:10.347
Please.

32:26.187 --> 32:28.626
You're right.

32:28.627 --> 32:32.506
It's better than genocide.

32:32.507 --> 32:35.267
Follow the path for about half
an hour until you get to an A-road.

32:36.707 --> 32:38.305
You'll know what to do from there.

32:38.306 --> 32:40.387
I'll make it look like you escaped.

32:41.987 --> 32:43.547
That's my assistant's e-mail.

32:43.548 --> 32:47.547
He's the one.

32:47.907 --> 32:51.907
You should get the manuscript,
contact him.

33:01.507 --> 33:02.946
Argh...

33:02.947 --> 33:06.947
Argh! Argh...

33:07.747 --> 33:09.681
Argh!

33:11.876 --> 33:15.876
You are having my husband's baby.

33:17.156 --> 33:19.755
Today...

33:19.756 --> 33:21.756
..new evidence is coming to light

33:21.757 --> 33:25.756
and you will be free by morning.

33:26.356 --> 33:28.835
I, I will be free?

33:28.836 --> 33:32.836
Yes. You will be free and you can do
whatever you like, I promise.

33:33.356 --> 33:37.356
But what we would like,
what we propose,

33:37.916 --> 33:40.835
is that you come with us.

33:40.836 --> 33:43.595
With you?

33:43.602 --> 33:44.800
I don't understand.

33:44.801 --> 33:46.600
We want to find you a flat,

33:46.601 --> 33:50.440
and you'll be safe there for
the entire term of your pregnancy.

33:50.441 --> 33:54.442
You will have the best care
we can get for you, I promise.

33:55.322 --> 33:59.322
And, when you have the baby...

33:59.882 --> 34:03.882
..we would like you to hand
over the child to us.

34:05.122 --> 34:09.121
We will pay you £250,000.

34:10.842 --> 34:14.842
My husband...

34:16.762 --> 34:20.721
My husband is...

34:20.722 --> 34:23.161
..weak.

34:23.161 --> 34:27.161
But he will make a very good father.

34:27.202 --> 34:31.201
And I will love your child
more than you can imagine.

34:31.202 --> 34:33.481
I promise.

34:33.482 --> 34:37.482
Can I see my baby?

34:38.442 --> 34:41.440
No.

34:41.442 --> 34:44.201
No, that is part of the deal.

34:44.202 --> 34:47.161
You can never see your child again.

35:01.282 --> 35:03.201
Where are we?

35:03.202 --> 35:06.401
That street...

35:06.402 --> 35:10.402
leads to a building they used to use.

35:10.682 --> 35:14.682
Old research base. Abandoned now.

35:17.202 --> 35:21.202
The manuscript. I hid it in there.

35:29.282 --> 35:33.282
Have you got your seat belt on?

35:54.269 --> 35:56.229
- You OK?
- Where'd you get that gun?

35:56.230 --> 36:00.229
The cafe, toilet cistern. Let's go.

36:09.549 --> 36:12.668
They'll have only just set that up.

36:12.669 --> 36:16.669
We've got a little time
before they move in force.

36:30.229 --> 36:34.229
Jesus Christ! You prepared all this?

36:34.429 --> 36:38.429
It'll keep them back!

36:56.029 --> 37:00.029
This was where I grew up.

37:06.309 --> 37:10.309
This is called tonalite gneiss.

37:13.669 --> 37:17.669
It's the oldest rock in the world.

37:18.069 --> 37:21.668
From a rock plateau in Canada.

37:21.669 --> 37:23.227
Where did you get that?

37:23.228 --> 37:27.229
He used to say, "This rock gives
you permission to do anything,

37:29.389 --> 37:33.389
"because, ultimately,
we're all just the blink of an eye."

37:34.229 --> 37:38.228
I was the first person
he experimented on.

37:38.229 --> 37:42.229
He looked for the nearest human
who wouldn't talk.

37:44.149 --> 37:47.308
His son.

37:47.924 --> 37:49.443
I don't believe you.

37:49.444 --> 37:51.603
But his experiments went wrong.

37:51.604 --> 37:52.883
No...

37:52.884 --> 37:56.563
And I was changed.

37:56.564 --> 37:58.803
Into this.

37:58.804 --> 38:00.604
This isn't possible.

38:02.564 --> 38:06.564
The manuscript's here, but I'm
warning you not to take it.

38:08.844 --> 38:12.523
Don't do what I did.

38:12.524 --> 38:16.524
Don't find out the truth
about our father.

38:23.804 --> 38:27.804
Give it to me.

39:33.724 --> 39:36.243
You look more gorgeous every day...

39:36.244 --> 39:38.043
Jesus Christ! Stop that!

39:38.044 --> 39:39.642
Why's everybody hitting me?

39:39.643 --> 39:41.482
You're selling it?! You're selling it
to them?!

39:41.483 --> 39:43.882
You only want it from me
so you can give it to them!

39:43.883 --> 39:45.762
OK, yes, all right,
I should've told you,

39:45.763 --> 39:47.724
but I fully intended to
split the money...

39:47.725 --> 39:51.123
It sterilises people,
d'you know that?

39:51.124 --> 39:53.604
And you just want to make
money from it.

39:53.605 --> 39:57.604
"Just make money"?
Did you say, "Just make money"?

39:58.604 --> 40:02.604
If they do this, it's social
and economic Armageddon.

40:03.244 --> 40:05.642
What d'you think
it'll be like getting old

40:05.643 --> 40:08.002
if there are no young
people to pay for it?

40:08.003 --> 40:10.844
Do you think there'll be
pension plans, healthcare,

40:10.845 --> 40:13.443
free fucking bus passes?

40:13.444 --> 40:17.444
In the future, if you're old,
you're dead, unless you have wealth.

40:17.684 --> 40:21.684
So instead of stopping it,
you just want to make money?

40:22.364 --> 40:24.602
Stop it?
Why should I want to stop it?

40:24.603 --> 40:26.644
They're right,
of course they're right.

40:26.645 --> 40:28.323
We have to do it.

40:28.324 --> 40:30.163
You're disgusting.

40:30.164 --> 40:33.403
And I will never give you
one part of Utopia.

40:33.404 --> 40:34.923
OK.

40:34.924 --> 40:37.043
OK, but tomorrow at noon,

40:37.044 --> 40:41.044
I'm going to be here with every
ounce of Thoraxin I have.

40:41.684 --> 40:45.684
Get me those pages, you get it all.
Enough to keep you going for years.

40:50.524 --> 40:54.524
But if you're not here at midday,
Becky...

40:57.204 --> 41:01.204
..I tell you, I'm going to throw
the whole fucking lot in that lake.

41:18.204 --> 41:19.323
Michael Dugdale?

41:19.324 --> 41:20.403
Yeah?

41:20.404 --> 41:22.123
I'd like to talk to you.

41:22.124 --> 41:25.563
About the Russian flu vaccine.

41:25.564 --> 41:29.564
What? I don't...

41:31.684 --> 41:33.123
Are you a journalist?

41:33.124 --> 41:35.923
No, I'm not a journalist.

41:35.924 --> 41:39.803
There's something in the vaccine.

41:39.804 --> 41:41.843
What do you mean? Is this...?

41:41.844 --> 41:44.564
Did you read about the massacre
at Bainstow School?

41:44.565 --> 41:46.963
Yeah.

41:46.964 --> 41:50.964
Grant.

41:54.884 --> 41:56.883
Oh, my God.

41:56.884 --> 41:59.163
He was set up.

41:59.164 --> 42:00.764
We've got something for you.

42:00.765 --> 42:04.764
A sample of the vaccine.

42:08.804 --> 42:12.804
Come quick. Come quick.

42:23.084 --> 42:25.883
Michael? Are you OK?

42:25.884 --> 42:28.163
It's fine, Jen, just...

42:28.164 --> 42:32.164
Look, I need to sort
something out.

42:36.004 --> 42:40.004
Well, can I see it?

42:50.844 --> 42:54.844
It's OK.

42:55.964 --> 42:57.124
Where did you get this?

42:57.125 --> 42:59.163
It doesn't matter.

42:59.164 --> 43:03.164
But that is it.

43:09.004 --> 43:12.123
Do you know what it does?

43:12.124 --> 43:14.643
It sterilises people.

43:14.644 --> 43:18.644
90 to 95% of the people who receive
the Russian flu vaccine...

43:21.524 --> 43:25.524
..will become sterile.

43:27.564 --> 43:29.843
Look, can you help us?

43:29.844 --> 43:33.844
There was a woman, Milner, MI5.
She said you'd help.

43:35.004 --> 43:36.204
I mean, are you sure?

43:36.205 --> 43:40.204
They're everywhere!
They kill people, we've seen them.

43:41.044 --> 43:45.044
They killed her mother.

43:54.684 --> 43:56.203
There's a man.

43:56.204 --> 44:00.204
A scientist. He's not a good man,
but he, he knows people.

44:04.324 --> 44:08.324
Stay here. I need to make a call.

44:09.044 --> 44:11.723
Are you hungry?
Do you want some food?

44:11.724 --> 44:13.123
No.

44:13.124 --> 44:17.124
Thank you. We're fine.

44:35.724 --> 44:39.724
Do you think we can trust him?

44:41.524 --> 44:44.923
Don't reckon we should hang around.

44:44.924 --> 44:48.522
I'm going to get him a sample
to him. I can make a trade.

44:48.523 --> 44:51.124
He'll put us
onto someone who can help.

44:51.125 --> 44:52.163
You serious?

44:52.164 --> 44:55.643
I mean it.
Do you need somewhere to stay?

44:55.644 --> 44:57.642
No, we have friends we need to get
back to.

44:57.643 --> 45:00.364
How do I get in touch with you?
Do you have a phone?

45:00.365 --> 45:02.323
We don't trust phones.

45:02.324 --> 45:04.243
OK.

45:04.244 --> 45:06.644
Come back here tomorrow.
Same time.

45:06.645 --> 45:10.644
OK.

45:11.044 --> 45:15.044
Come on.

45:17.844 --> 45:18.964
Stay where you are!

45:18.965 --> 45:22.964
Move!

45:23.884 --> 45:26.643
Come on!

45:26.644 --> 45:28.244
Down!

45:29.404 --> 45:30.664
Get off me!

46:08.524 --> 46:12.524
I need... water.

46:12.764 --> 46:15.843
What did you tell them?

46:15.844 --> 46:19.844
I... Tell them?

46:20.884 --> 46:23.963
I told them nothing!

46:23.964 --> 46:25.163
I need water.

46:25.164 --> 46:28.003
They have the vaccine.

46:28.004 --> 46:30.803
Yes, but they don't know
what it is.

46:30.804 --> 46:33.602
They're just children.
They know nothing.

46:33.603 --> 46:36.164
They know exactly what it
is because you told them.

46:36.165 --> 46:38.203
No, I... I said nothing. I...

46:38.204 --> 46:42.204
Enough of this. Finish him.

46:43.564 --> 46:45.683
He's served his purpose.

46:45.684 --> 46:47.843
He made good cover.

46:47.844 --> 46:49.483
Now he's a liability.

46:49.484 --> 46:53.484
It's time to end this.

46:54.804 --> 46:56.523
You want me to...?

46:56.524 --> 46:58.924
Well, I'm not going to do it myself,
am I?

46:58.925 --> 47:01.003
Everything's been arranged.

47:01.004 --> 47:04.683
His medical records now
show a history of depression.

47:04.684 --> 47:06.762
We've men ready to take his body

47:06.763 --> 47:09.762
to hang from a bridge in Richmond.
We have a coroner there.

47:09.763 --> 47:11.324
No, I don't think I can...

47:11.325 --> 47:15.163
Yes, of course you can.

47:15.164 --> 47:18.723
You see, it's an order.

47:18.724 --> 47:22.724
I'm giving you an order.
