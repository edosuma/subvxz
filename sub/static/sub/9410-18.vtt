Oh, great! My allergies.

Weren't your grandparents
supposed to pick us up at the airport?

01:28.700 --> 01:30.367
They're getting
kind of old, you know.

01:30.367 --> 01:32.867
My dad says sometimes
they forget things.

01:32.867 --> 01:34.467
Yeah, like us.

01:34.967 --> 01:36.467
Look around, Gretchen.

01:36.467 --> 01:39.100
There's nothing but
mosquitoes and frogs.

That's my grandmother.
Come on.

01:53.333 --> 01:56.767
Oh.
Your grandma has a gumbo stand.

01:56.767 --> 01:58.367
What's gumbo?

01:58.867 --> 02:02.633
It's Grandma's specialty.
It's kind of like a thick soup.

02:03.067 --> 02:05.333
So why doesn't she just
call it soup?

02:05.333 --> 02:08.699
- Because it's called gumbo.
- Whatever.

02:13.067 --> 02:17.367
There it is--

There wouldn't even
be a honeymoon...

They locked us in.
I bet they did it on purpose.

I bet they wanted that
monster upstairs to eat us.

13:45.600 --> 13:46.667
Get a grip, Clark.

13:46.667 --> 13:49.133
Why would my grandparents
want to feed us to a monster?

13:49.633 --> 13:53.733
I don't know. Maybe they've
been out in the swamp too long.

13:53.733 --> 13:55.467
There's another door in the kitchen.

13:57.567 --> 14:00.633
Hey. Wait for me.

14:01.133 --> 14:04.133
They probably just lock the front
door and leave the back one open.

Everyone does that down here.

Okay, so we'll just have to
get out a window or something.

It's a little late for that,

I hope so.
I've got an idea.

15:30.200 --> 15:32.467
[ Pounding ]

15:32.467 --> 15:35.233
[ Roaring ]

15:40.933 --> 15:42.933
- You think it'll work?
- It has to.

15:42.933 --> 15:45.000
- [ Roaring ]
- Let's do it.

16:00.300 --> 16:01.800
[ Roaring Continues ]

16:01.800 --> 16:03.600
It's ready.

16:03.600 --> 16:07.367
[ Pounding, Rattling ]

16:11.200 --> 16:13.467
[ Creature Grunting ]

16:15.700 --> 16:18.233
[ Snuffles ]

16:25.967 --> 16:28.567
[ Screeches ]

16:30.767 --> 16:32.767
[ Screeching ]

16:32.767 --> 16:35.700
[ Slurps, Screeches ]

16:35.700 --> 16:38.600
- He's not gonna eat it.
- Shh!

16:40.933 --> 16:43.467
[ Screeches ]

16:47.167 --> 16:51.833
[ Whispering ] Great idea,
Gretchen. It likes your recipe.

16:51.833 --> 16:53.500
Look.

16:53.500 --> 16:56.200
[ Roaring ]

17:07.032 --> 17:09.032
- Is it?
- I don't know.

17:11.067 --> 17:14.166
- Let's get out of here.
- We have to be sure.

17:20.267 --> 17:21.767
Can we please get out of here?

17:22.633 --> 17:23.967
Okay. Come on.

17:24.467 --> 17:26.467
[ Gretchen ]
Let's try the cellar.

17:26.467 --> 17:29.467
What makes you think
there's a way out down here?

17:29.467 --> 17:32.467
- I've got an idea.
- [ Scoffs ] Not another one?

17:33.967 --> 17:36.500
- There.
- What is it?

17:36.500 --> 17:39.900
A coal chute. That's how they
used to heat these old houses.

17:41.900 --> 17:45.633
There's gotta be something
around here we can use.

17:46.133 --> 17:48.000
- What if this door's locked too?
- What if it isn't?

17:48.000 --> 17:49.967
I'm not just gonna sit
around here waiting for you

17:49.967 --> 17:53.900
- to get us into any more trouble.
- What? Me?

17:53.900 --> 17:56.633
You're the one that went
into the room in the first place.

17:57.133 --> 18:01.133
Well, you're the one who went in the
second time and bothered the thing.

18:01.133 --> 18:03.333
Oh, please.
I bothered it?

18:03.333 --> 18:06.367
You're the one that
dropped him down the stairs.

18:06.867 --> 18:09.367
At least I did something.
You just ran around like a chicken,

18:09.367 --> 18:11.867
screaming, "It's gonna eat us!
It's gonna eat us!"

18:11.867 --> 18:13.867
- I did not.
- Did too.

18:13.867 --> 18:16.100
- Did not!  - Did--
- [ Creature Screeches ]

18:16.100 --> 18:17.833
- Clark!
- [ Screeching ]

18:19.767 --> 18:20.700
[ Roaring, Screeching ]

18:21.200 --> 18:22.700
- Climb up!
- What about you?

18:23.200 --> 18:25.367
Don't worry about me.
Just go.

18:27.433 --> 18:28.833
[ Roaring, Screeching ]

18:28.833 --> 18:31.167
Grab my arm!

18:31.667 --> 18:34.267
[ Both Straining ]

18:35.767 --> 18:37.833
[ Screeching ]

18:38.367 --> 18:42.167
- [ Gasping ]
- [ Screeching ]

18:43.667 --> 18:46.300
- Clark!
- [ Roaring ]

18:48.033 --> 18:49.767
- [ Shouts ]
- Clark!

18:49.767 --> 18:52.333
- [ Screaming ]
- [ Screeching ]   - Clark!

18:52.333 --> 18:54.667
- [ Screaming ]
- Clark!

18:55.100 --> 18:57.100
- [ Screaming ]
- [ Screeching ]

19:00.200 --> 19:02.033
[ Groaning ]

19:02.433 --> 19:05.267
- [ Whimpers ]
- [ Bellows ]

19:05.867 --> 19:08.533
[ Groaning ]

19:10.967 --> 19:13.800
Huh?

19:13.800 --> 19:15.733
Is it really dead this time?

19:17.033 --> 19:21.167
[ Both Groan, Sigh ]

19:23.767 --> 19:26.533
I'd say yes.

19:33.533 --> 19:35.533
[ Clark ] I don't get why
the monster reacted like that.

19:35.533 --> 19:37.533
It grabbed me.

19:37.533 --> 19:40.033
I'm close enough to its
face to become its lunch,

19:40.033 --> 19:41.933
and then it starts sneezing.

19:42.367 --> 19:44.900
- [ Sneezes ]
- Allergies.

19:45.400 --> 19:47.200
Clark, the monster
was allergic to you.

19:47.700 --> 19:49.233
Cool.

19:49.233 --> 19:52.600
Look. Gretchen.

19:52.600 --> 19:56.200
What I said before about you
starting all of this--

19:56.700 --> 19:58.200
Well, I'm sorry.

19:58.700 --> 20:00.600
It wasn't your fault.
It would have gotten out anyway.

20:00.600 --> 20:04.300
And besides, you did have a lot
of good ideas about how to kill it.

20:04.300 --> 20:05.733
That's okay.

20:05.733 --> 20:09.467
I guess we make a
pretty good team, Sister.

20:09.467 --> 20:11.033
I guess we do, Brother.

20:11.533 --> 20:13.533
Hey, check that letter.

20:13.533 --> 20:16.033
It might say when your
grandparents are getting back.

20:21.533 --> 20:23.267
It doesn't say.

20:23.767 --> 20:25.667
There's something on the back.

20:26.100 --> 20:29.200
"P.S. Grandpa shot a monster
while he was out hunting.

20:29.700 --> 20:32.533
"We didn't tell you about it
because we didn't want to scare you.

20:33.033 --> 20:36.567
Just don't disturb it,
and everything will be fine."

20:36.567 --> 20:39.900
- Oh, so now they tell us.
- Wait. "P.P.S.

20:39.900 --> 20:42.400
"There might be more of them
out there in the swamp,

20:42.400 --> 20:44.933
"so we're locking you in
until we get back.

20:45.433 --> 20:49.433
Whatever happens, don't go out
into the swamp after dark."

20:58.867 --> 21:01.433
So, got any more ideas?
