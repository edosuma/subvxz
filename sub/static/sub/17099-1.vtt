- Terribly exciting isn't it, sir?
- Why is that, George?

01:09.616 --> 01:11.715
One of these young ladies is slated

01:11.743 --> 01:13.382
to become Mrs. Rodney Strong,

01:13.413 --> 01:15.066
now that his family have deemed it time

01:15.080 --> 01:16.567
that he settled down and married.

01:16.622 --> 01:18.601
That's him there, sir.

Although rumour has it that he's been

01:21.184 --> 01:23.297
peculiarly uninterested in entertaining

the company of young
ladies up to this point.

- Shy, sir.

01:28.249 --> 01:29.499
Extremely shy.

01:29.619 --> 01:31.341
An unusual trait given that he's

01:31.380 --> 01:34.534
widely considered the most eligible
bachelor in the entire city of Toronto.

01:34.654 --> 01:36.288
And the whole country, I'd reckon.

01:36.632 --> 01:37.882
Thank you for coming.

I know for a modern woman like yourself,

- Oh, we're very sophisticated. (little snicker)

Some of the most eligible
young ladies in the city, sir,

Oh, sir!

01:57.711 --> 01:59.478
This is Madeline Wellwood.

Eldest daughter of Ralph

Who, by the way, sir,
have all taken up residence

02:25.089 --> 02:28.497
in this hotel for the festivities
over the next few days. Apparently,

02:28.569 --> 02:30.926

each other out of their sight.

You're English Aristocracy.

02:52.892 --> 02:56.233
Twenty-three years of age

02:56.429 --> 02:59.129
In fact they say the only reason
she is in attendance at all

02:59.140 --> 03:02.660
is because her family are picking
up the cost of the entire event.

03:02.958 --> 03:06.518
- George, how do you know all this?
- Madge Merton, sir!

03:06.638 --> 03:09.548
Her "Page For Women" in
the Toronto Daily Star is...

03:09.589 --> 03:11.292
essential reading for
anybody who wants to know

03:11.294 --> 03:13.497

03:13.885 --> 03:16.420
Ah! Faye Sloane, sir.

They say she has cut many to the
quick with her razor-sharp tongue.

03:19.624 --> 03:22.515
In fact, Madge Merton says
there is a movement afoot

03:22.527 --> 03:24.502
to have her tongue
registered as a deadly...

03:24.529 --> 03:26.953

Just trying to edify
you, sir, in case you are

03:28.862 --> 03:30.710

There she is.

Doesn't she look lovely?

03:34.976 --> 03:36.254
She does

03:36.287 --> 03:38.268
I must say this eligible bachelor

03:38.279 --> 03:40.158

She was not a virgin,
but she was not pregnant.

- Doctor Ogden was here?
- Earlier today...

11:22.717 --> 11:24.830

11:25.826 --> 11:27.901
Lady Suzanne Atherly came in.

11:27.946 --> 11:29.705
She said she needed
Dr. Ogden for something

11:29.721 --> 11:31.387

anything in this life,

12:31.921 --> 12:34.125
it is that one must always move forward

12:34.142 --> 12:36.095

12:36.919 --> 12:38.582
If death

12:38.702 --> 12:41.457
has provided Elizabeth
with this opportunity...

12:42.365 --> 12:44.035

holier-than-thou, Julia.

12:59.677 --> 13:02.371

how ruthless you can be

13:02.491 --> 13:04.934

13:56.993 --> 13:58.708
I was going to marry her.

14:00.374 --> 14:02.266

ladies suggested that

14:02.277 --> 14:05.144
Miss Embree was carrying a secret.

14:05.215 --> 14:08.137
One that may have cost her her life.

14:08.349 --> 14:10.843
- What was it?
- (knocking)

14:12.430 --> 14:14.787
I was hoping you might enlighten me.

14:15.291 --> 14:16.868
I'm sorry.

14:18.412 --> 14:20.659
Did Miss Embree try to force your hand?

14:20.694 --> 14:22.108
What are you suggesting?

14:22.285 --> 14:24.642
Did she force you to marry her?

14:24.762 --> 14:26.120
Heavens, no!

14:26.164 --> 14:28.471
Did she tell you that
she was with child?

14:29.240 --> 14:30.386
No.

14:30.506 --> 14:31.625
Was she?

14:33.007 --> 14:35.726
(sigh from Mr. Strong

14:36.478 --> 14:38.610
I had grown quite fond of Ruth.

14:39.001 --> 14:41.125
I thought she would
make a suitable bride.

14:42.486 --> 14:44.362
Had the two of you been intimate?

14:44.826 --> 14:46.751
I don't see how that
is any of your business.

14:46.787 --> 14:48.300
Mr. Strong...

14:50.845 --> 14:52.969
Yes, we had been.

14:53.688 --> 14:56.322
Now I fear that will be the
last happy day of my life!

14:57.938 --> 14:59.297
Look at this.

to be sorry for me.

15:03.342 --> 15:04.865
They know I have to marry!

15:05.324 --> 15:08.035
Each one of them is just
hoping I'll pick her, now.

15:08.892 --> 15:10.087
My God.

15:10.155 --> 15:12.362

15:31.350 --> 15:33.769
- Give me a minute?
- Of course.

15:38.572 --> 15:40.137
He's a good man, Detective.

15:40.257 --> 15:42.632
His heart is heavy, but he'll recover.

15:43.544 --> 15:46.727
It seems odd that he would
have to go through with all this

15:46.847 --> 15:49.846
after the woman that he loves just died.

15:50.207 --> 15:51.981
I don't know that he loved her;

15:52.016 --> 15:53.848
she was simply his first.

15:54.523 --> 15:56.255
And he will honour his
commitment to his family,

15:56.288 --> 15:57.644
that's more important.

15:57.699 --> 16:00.316
Who'd have the most to gain
from Miss Embree's death?

16:00.941 --> 16:02.206
Any one of them.

16:02.326 --> 16:04.359
The Strong's family fortune is...

16:04.619 --> 16:06.689
- considerable.
- Of course.

16:06.944 --> 16:09.738
- Thank you.
- Rodney, we should get a move on.

16:50.690 --> 16:53.155

17:03.653 --> 17:05.801
No, I don't think you did.

Maybe she was killed for some
reason we've yet to discover,

23:06.065 --> 23:09.009
something completely unrelated
to this wedding lottery.

23:09.258 --> 23:11.310
I don't know, sir. From
what I've discovered,

23:11.344 --> 23:14.647
- she lived a quiet, unremarkable life.
- Her family?

23:15.067 --> 23:16.744
Respected and admired.

23:17.025 --> 23:19.062
Those are usually the
ones worth watching.

23:19.073 --> 23:21.147
I don't care if it's late!
He'll want to hear this.

23:21.203 --> 23:23.327
- Detective Murdoch!
- Who's that?

23:23.571 --> 23:25.928
Faye Sloane, apparently the deceased's

23:25.950 --> 23:28.025
- nearest and dearest friend.
- Please, ma'am!

23:28.053 --> 23:29.397
Let her in, please.

23:32.125 --> 23:33.928
Miss Sloane, what can I do for you?

23:34.847 --> 23:37.364
I told you Ruth was
holding onto a secret.

23:37.885 --> 23:39.200
Yes, you did.

23:39.495 --> 23:41.172
And now I know what it is.

23:45.574 --> 23:47.794
(door closing nearby)

23:48.165 --> 23:50.627
- Julia?
- William.

23:51.347 --> 23:53.533
I thought you were to
be at that reception.

23:53.782 --> 23:54.938
I was!

23:55.359 --> 23:56.642
I had enough.

23:57.190 --> 23:58.944
And Lady Atherly?

23:59.064 --> 24:00.864
Oh she's still there,

24:00.908 --> 24:03.104
monitoring her daughter's progress.

24:04.830 --> 24:08.969
She is hoping Elizabeth will become
the future Mrs. Rodney Strong.

24:09.472 --> 24:10.900
Hm...

24:12.567 --> 24:13.878
Julia,

24:14.392 --> 24:17.192
I need to bring your
friend in for questioning.

24:18.298 --> 24:22.174
Lady Atherly may not be
exactly what she seems.

24:22.209 --> 24:24.109
♪♪♪

24:35.791 --> 24:37.435
(clanking of cup in saucer)

24:38.176 --> 24:40.074
Now what is it, Detective?

24:40.395 --> 24:41.861
It's quite a busy week.

24:43.432 --> 24:46.592
Is your relocation to
Canada a permanent one?

24:46.642 --> 24:47.942
Possibly.

24:48.363 --> 24:51.074
- May I ask why?
- You're a detective.

24:51.340 --> 24:53.265
I didn't think you needed permission,

24:53.602 --> 24:55.212
I thought you just took it.

24:55.959 --> 24:57.757
Why have you moved to Canada?

24:57.807 --> 24:59.611
That's hardly your concern.

25:01.636 --> 25:03.916
I've received information that...

25:03.949 --> 25:06.334
you've recently suffered great loss

25:06.345 --> 25:08.038
financially back home.

25:08.077 --> 25:09.460
Now, that's not true.

25:09.997 --> 25:12.746
But even if it was, what
better way to start afresh

25:12.866 --> 25:14.295
than in a new country,

25:14.367 --> 25:17.123
full of potential and opportunity?

25:17.504 --> 25:20.935
And wealthy young bachelors
looking to marry quickly?

25:21.975 --> 25:25.323
(enunciating clearly):
I. Killed. A young woman.

25:25.367 --> 25:27.792
So that I could prostitute my daughter?

25:28.598 --> 25:30.330
Your words, not mine.

25:30.385 --> 25:33.048
No, sir, but they are your insinuations.

25:33.279 --> 25:35.377
As they are those of Miss Sloane.

25:35.686 --> 25:38.502
Miss Sloane asked some friends of mine

25:38.530 --> 25:40.345
back home about our situation.

25:40.688 --> 25:44.689
They wired me to notify
me of her... inquiries.

25:45.508 --> 25:46.702
I see.

25:47.034 --> 25:48.960
I'm surprised you believed

25:48.998 --> 25:50.403
that little snoop.

25:50.923 --> 25:52.473
You deny her claims?

25:52.677 --> 25:56.052
While my... family's financial situation

25:56.109 --> 25:59.551
may not be as robust as it
was while my husband was alive,

25:59.843 --> 26:02.243
we retain one thing we
shall never surrender.

26:02.854 --> 26:04.298
Breeding.

26:04.715 --> 26:07.452
I am not quite finished, Lady Atherly.

26:08.138 --> 26:10.584
- (again, enunciating
clearly): I was with your wife

26:10.611 --> 26:13.173
in the hours leading to
that poor girl's death.

26:13.522 --> 26:15.664
I could hardly have been
aware of the situation

26:15.708 --> 26:18.108
regarding Mr. Strong's need to marry

26:18.138 --> 26:20.256
prior to my arrival in this country.

26:21.048 --> 26:22.049
Now...

26:23.117 --> 26:24.666
are we are finished?

26:27.974 --> 26:29.385
Thank you.

26:33.672 --> 26:36.218
I know he has a job to
do. I understand that,

26:36.278 --> 26:38.259
but really this is beyond the pale.

26:38.379 --> 26:41.496
- He is a very thorough man.
- Who thinks I am a murderer!

26:41.616 --> 26:43.488
He as much as accused
me of killing that girl.

26:43.494 --> 26:45.276
- I'm sure he was just doing...
- I trust you will be able

26:45.287 --> 26:47.888
to disabuse him of that notion. Oh!

26:52.275 --> 26:55.689
- I was doing my job.
- Well, I told her as much!

26:56.463 --> 26:57.675
But?

26:58.998 --> 27:01.764
Was there a need to
accuse her so directly?

27:02.804 --> 27:04.984
I was prodding a suspect,

27:05.543 --> 27:07.740
same as I've done a hundred times!

27:08.543 --> 27:11.270
Should I have gone more
easily on Lady Atherly

27:11.281 --> 27:13.052
because she's a friend of yours?

27:14.115 --> 27:15.819
I suppose not.

27:18.695 --> 27:20.865
Julia, what is it, what's troubling you?

27:20.985 --> 27:23.172
(with a snicker): Nothing!

27:28.949 --> 27:30.238
Julia...

27:31.516 --> 27:33.807
these past few months,

27:35.356 --> 27:36.684
it's as though you've been

27:36.711 --> 27:38.886
living under a dark cloud.

27:40.529 --> 27:43.826
Well, that's what happens
when one's every waking hour

27:43.860 --> 27:46.793
is consumed with murder
and... tales of murder.

27:49.941 --> 27:52.110
It's the life we've both chosen.

27:52.752 --> 27:53.975
I know that.

27:54.639 --> 27:57.334
But perhaps there should
be more to life than death.

28:00.477 --> 28:02.347
"And the name of the
English Rose who has pricked

28:02.369 --> 28:03.818
Mr. Rodney Strong's heart?

28:03.879 --> 28:05.678
Lady Elizabeth Atherly.

28:05.727 --> 28:07.875
Young Lady Elizabeth has
certainly made an impression

28:07.886 --> 28:09.966
on Toronto's most eligible bachelor.

28:10.086 --> 28:12.621
And with only days before
Mr. Strong is to make

28:12.741 --> 28:16.235
his announcement, young Lady
Elizabeth seemed on the brink

28:16.257 --> 28:18.686
of turning Toronto Society on its ear!"

28:18.686 --> 28:20.373
Well, this doesn't bode well.

28:20.412 --> 28:22.609
Pressure's now gonna
redouble on Rodney Strong

28:22.620 --> 28:24.828
to marry Miss Fairhurst. It's
what both the families want.

28:24.948 --> 28:26.997
Why do you read that old bat, George?

28:27.036 --> 28:29.100
Henry. Madge Merton
is an authority on this

28:29.111 --> 28:31.019
and a keen observer of high society.

28:31.041 --> 28:34.323
And she has excellent advice
regarding haberdashery.

28:34.345 --> 28:35.605
Bring her in.

28:36.219 --> 28:37.254
Bring who in?

28:37.596 --> 28:38.815
Madge Merton.

28:39.512 --> 28:41.736
Sir. It's the height of
debutante season. Are you mad?

28:41.769 --> 28:43.069
She'll be very busy.

28:43.334 --> 28:45.814
I assure you, George, I am not mad.

28:46.898 --> 28:48.182
Very well!

28:49.493 --> 28:52.520
They're the cream of
womanhood, all of them.

28:52.581 --> 28:54.551
I can hardly imagine that one of them

28:54.568 --> 28:57.128
would commit such a heinous crime.

28:57.157 --> 28:59.847
I've heard a rumour that
Mr. Strong was pledged

28:59.847 --> 29:02.248
- to marry Erma Fairhurst.
- That might have been true

29:02.259 --> 29:05.108
when they were children, but
it certainly isn't the case now.

29:05.228 --> 29:08.174
Mr. Strong has no interest in her.

29:08.201 --> 29:09.750
Especially after...

29:10.032 --> 29:12.467
- After what?
- I shouldn't say.

29:14.962 --> 29:18.000
Mrs. Merton. This is
a police investigation.

29:18.170 --> 29:21.728
There was gossip that Erma
was committed to an asylum,

29:21.739 --> 29:23.903
- poor girl.
- Do you know where?

29:23.914 --> 29:25.109
I do not.

29:25.153 --> 29:27.045
But she is an unhappy young woman

29:27.056 --> 29:29.873
who seems destined for
a life of spinsterhood.

29:29.900 --> 29:31.345
Especially now.

29:32.656 --> 29:34.903
Well, thanks for your time, Mrs. Merton.

29:35.407 --> 29:38.522
You will keep me abreast
of future developments?

29:38.522 --> 29:41.864
My readers are keenly
interested in this story.

29:41.936 --> 29:43.657
Oh, you'll be the first to know.

29:43.701 --> 29:45.433
And Detective,

29:45.553 --> 29:47.471
the readers would love to know

29:47.471 --> 29:50.320
about your and Dr. Ogden's marriage.

29:51.499 --> 29:53.231
I... I...

29:53.351 --> 29:55.100
I prefer to keep them guessing.

29:55.134 --> 29:56.395
Shame!

29:58.796 --> 30:01.508
I'll ask Doctor Ogden
about Miss Fairhurst.

30:01.628 --> 30:03.538
Murdoch, if you have a minute?

30:04.043 --> 30:05.348
Have a seat.

30:08.087 --> 30:09.321
Sir?

30:11.080 --> 30:13.601
How is the Missus? If
you don't mind me asking.

30:14.101 --> 30:15.413
Sir?

30:15.890 --> 30:18.506
Two weeks ago when the Board of Control

30:18.528 --> 30:20.946
denied her request for
additional funding for the morgue,

30:21.112 --> 30:24.239
I would have expected to see
her in here all guns ablaze!

30:24.515 --> 30:25.631
Instead,

30:25.666 --> 30:26.894
not a Dicky bird.

30:26.944 --> 30:29.716
Perhaps she already
knew that she'd be denied.

30:30.170 --> 30:31.912
Never stopped her before.

30:32.206 --> 30:34.453
She's not the type to
take no for an answer.

30:35.050 --> 30:37.285
Well sir, she has been different

30:37.296 --> 30:39.931
since the incident
with Eva Pearce. But...

30:40.051 --> 30:42.719
I've spoken to her about
it and she assures me

30:42.719 --> 30:45.192
- that she is fine.
- (little snicker)

30:45.646 --> 30:47.007
Never trust that word when

30:47.029 --> 30:48.933
it comes out of the
mouth of a woman, Murdoch.

30:49.053 --> 30:50.548
When Margaret says she's "fine",

30:50.571 --> 30:52.723
I know that I'm one step
away from the doghouse.

30:53.497 --> 30:55.550
But she is a strong woman, sir.

30:55.589 --> 30:57.371
I've no doubt of that, Murdoch.

30:58.239 --> 30:59.761
She was shot three times.

30:59.772 --> 31:02.135
Sometimes physical
strength is not enough.

31:03.541 --> 31:05.334
I'm sure she'll get through this.

You know that I've felt it;

You did that yourself.

very room where you found her.

35:28.117 --> 35:29.750
But she was alive when I left.

35:30.070 --> 35:33.225
- What words?
- She was unnecessarily cruel.

35:33.920 --> 35:36.723
She told me I was well past the
age Rodney was interested in.

35:36.728 --> 35:38.582
But she's wrong, you know.

35:38.859 --> 35:40.447
- Of course.
- Now that Ruth is gone,

35:40.464 --> 35:41.969
everyone will see that.

35:45.422 --> 35:49.627
Miss Fairhurst, have you ever
spent time in an institution?

35:51.281 --> 35:52.720
Who told you?

35:53.171 --> 35:54.136
Have you?

35:56.444 --> 35:58.856
My father had me
committed ten years ago.

35:59.304 --> 36:01.284
He had hoped to cure me of my fear.

36:01.611 --> 36:04.161
- Fear of what?
- Fire.

36:04.831 --> 36:06.773
He took up smoking when
I was a young child.

36:06.784 --> 36:08.245
There was an incident.

36:08.787 --> 36:11.078
He fell asleep and
lit our house on fire.

36:11.321 --> 36:13.357
All of my dollies were destroyed.

36:13.374 --> 36:15.223
I couldn't imagine their suffering.

36:15.781 --> 36:18.481
After that, I found the
idea of smoking intolerable.

36:18.487 --> 36:19.903
And it gave me nightmares.

36:21.480 --> 36:23.361
And did he not stop?

36:23.754 --> 36:25.237
It has a hold on him.

36:25.663 --> 36:27.910
So he sent me to the asylum to cure me.

36:29.061 --> 36:31.357
Well, you... seem fine now.

36:31.477 --> 36:32.685
Thank you.

36:35.098 --> 36:37.831
But could you imagine a worse death?

36:38.202 --> 36:40.564
To be consumed in flames...

36:40.769 --> 36:43.392
If I was to kill Faye, that's
how I would have done it.

36:43.512 --> 36:45.694
A bullet seems almost merciful.

36:46.817 --> 36:49.317
You won't breathe a word of
this to Rodney, will you? It...

36:49.437 --> 36:51.436
it might upset him.

36:53.870 --> 36:56.127
<i>- So she's a nutter?</i>
- Perhaps.

36:56.133 --> 36:58.806
But if she intended to kill
those two out of malice,

36:58.822 --> 37:00.848
I believe she would have
used a different method.

37:00.887 --> 37:02.164
So why kill Faye Sloane?

37:02.187 --> 37:04.240
She had no interest
in marrying Mr. Strong.

37:04.284 --> 37:07.642
The only one seems to have motive
for killing her is Lady Atherly.

37:07.762 --> 37:08.916
Agreed.

37:09.121 --> 37:11.328
She knew Faye Sloane
was snooping around.

37:11.356 --> 37:13.154
All but admitted her situation.

37:13.365 --> 37:15.334
Perhaps there is something
else she is hiding.

37:15.793 --> 37:17.414
I've wired Scotland Yard.

37:17.458 --> 37:19.771
A detective there has agreed
to look into it for us.

37:19.826 --> 37:22.350
Well, that bobby best get to
it. At the rate we are going,

37:22.470 --> 37:25.160
there is going to be nobody left
to marry this bloody bachelor!

37:25.432 --> 37:27.701
Higgins, if this is about Miss Hall...

37:27.717 --> 37:30.368
- It's not about...
- Because she is clearly not interested in you.

37:30.432 --> 37:31.774
Now, I know that might be a...

37:31.801 --> 37:34.396
- a... a bitter pill to swallow...
- Not about Miss Hall.

37:35.137 --> 37:36.715
What is it then?

37:37.832 --> 37:39.487
See for yourself.

37:40.075 --> 37:42.642
♪♪♪ (piano music)

37:42.677 --> 37:44.944
(lewd whistling, cheering and laughing)

37:50.618 --> 37:53.525
(whistling)

37:53.645 --> 37:55.351
Is this what you brought me to see?

37:55.423 --> 37:58.405
- No, George.
- Higgins, do you have to stare?

37:59.982 --> 38:01.531
Isn't that the point?

38:09.128 --> 38:11.391
Hello! So glad to see you!

38:11.413 --> 38:14.245
- I told you I'd come by and see you!
- I have something for you.

38:14.268 --> 38:15.479
Yeah?

38:17.178 --> 38:18.699
Here.

38:19.148 --> 38:21.632
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh. Come on!

38:23.225 --> 38:26.042
George! I didn't know you were here!

38:26.053 --> 38:27.613
No, apparently not!

38:28.459 --> 38:30.589
Is he one of your secrets I'm
not supposed to know about?

38:31.342 --> 38:32.719
Hardly.

38:33.405 --> 38:35.613
This is my brother Samuel.

38:37.406 --> 38:39.724
Oh... I see.

38:39.769 --> 38:41.872
Sam has just started a new business.

38:41.992 --> 38:44.539
- I'm giving him a helping hand.
- Right.

38:44.854 --> 38:47.620
- Thank you Nina, you won't regret it.
- I'll see you out.

38:52.013 --> 38:54.558
- It's her brother.
- Yes, I can see that, George.

38:54.840 --> 38:58.232
I just... I thought something
wasn't on the up and up.

38:58.553 --> 39:00.196
Something isn't.

39:00.572 --> 39:01.862
What's that?

39:02.963 --> 39:05.425
What kind of a man
borrows money from a woman?

39:05.945 --> 39:08.357
I don't know, George. A sensible one?

39:08.656 --> 39:10.272
There's something else.

39:10.278 --> 39:12.120
I've seen him somewhere before.

39:13.255 --> 39:16.237
(chuckling)

39:28.442 --> 39:29.848
Time to go, Rodney.

39:29.870 --> 39:31.558
Tomorrow is the big day.

39:31.624 --> 39:33.394
Well, tonight's a big night!

39:33.587 --> 39:36.774
Yes, but tomorrow you must
announce your intentions.

39:36.824 --> 39:40.426
Oh, I think my intentions are
clear. Don't you, Elizabeth?

39:40.780 --> 39:42.804
One more drink, Bish!

39:42.854 --> 39:44.144
You'll join me?

39:44.264 --> 39:45.920
I'll leave you to it.

39:49.079 --> 39:50.612
Detective Murdoch.

39:51.685 --> 39:54.038
- Lady Elizabeth.
- Have you found anything

39:54.042 --> 39:56.123
about what happened to those poor girls?

39:56.593 --> 39:58.696
The investigation is proceeding.

39:59.216 --> 40:00.942
I don't know how you do it.

40:01.811 --> 40:04.295
Surrounding yourself with such tragedy.

40:04.715 --> 40:06.381
I think it would break my heart.

40:06.746 --> 40:09.059
You are a brave man, Detective Murdoch.

40:09.690 --> 40:12.395
Gosh, forgive me for prattling on. I...

40:12.982 --> 40:15.671
- I've a big day tomorrow.
- Yes!

40:17.336 --> 40:19.272
One I never would have
never thought possible.

40:19.930 --> 40:22.012
- Good night.
- Good night.

40:33.903 --> 40:35.320
(door closing)

40:35.873 --> 40:37.389
Julia?

40:55.710 --> 40:57.248
Uh, pardon me.

40:57.315 --> 40:59.484
Any response to my wire to London yet?

40:59.517 --> 41:01.741
- Not yet, sir.
- The minute you hear something.

41:01.780 --> 41:03.290
Of course.

41:05.199 --> 41:07.988
I knew it. I knew it!

41:08.209 --> 41:09.858
- What is it, George?
- Sir.

41:09.858 --> 41:12.730
Nina Bloom's brother; I knew
I recognized him. He's a thief!

41:12.802 --> 41:14.441
He's a proper scoundrel!

41:15.238 --> 41:16.577
I'm going to speak to him.

41:16.759 --> 41:18.563
Has he done something wrong?

41:18.624 --> 41:21.393
Not recently, sir, but
certainly has in the past!

41:21.618 --> 41:24.584
- George...
- Sir, it's a personal matter.

41:24.756 --> 41:26.382
I need to have words with the man.

41:28.391 --> 41:31.157
Miss Bloom lent him a
considerable sum of money, sir.

41:31.621 --> 41:33.913
George seems unreasonably
upset about this.

41:34.400 --> 41:37.321
- Henry, keep an eye on him.
- Sir.

41:40.188 --> 41:42.463
(horse nickering and
hooves on cobblestone)

41:44.266 --> 41:45.367
You're a thief!

41:45.771 --> 41:46.819
What?

41:46.939 --> 41:48.871
You did time in the Don Jail.

41:48.906 --> 41:49.854
Eighteen months, I believe.

41:49.871 --> 41:51.564
And a whole string
of crimes before that!

41:52.012 --> 41:54.363
- Leave me alone.
- And now you're gonna steal from your sister.

41:54.430 --> 41:56.254
- She's loaning me money.
- And loaning you money

41:56.276 --> 41:57.975
- that you're then going to lose!
- Now hold on.

41:57.986 --> 42:01.057
- If I find out you harm her in any way...
- George,

42:02.047 --> 42:03.475
what is going on?

42:03.595 --> 42:05.428
He wants me to give you your money back.

42:05.548 --> 42:07.774
You'll do no such thing.

42:07.894 --> 42:09.378
George, what makes you think

42:09.390 --> 42:10.920
that this has anything to do with you?

42:10.922 --> 42:12.461
I'm just trying to look out for you.

42:12.461 --> 42:14.049
And I don't need your help.

42:14.093 --> 42:16.422
This is family business, not yours.

42:16.848 --> 42:18.265
Now if you don't mind,

42:18.293 --> 42:20.635
I am going to go back to helping
my brother open his business.

42:21.535 --> 42:22.575
Nina.

42:22.758 --> 42:24.429
- Nina!
- George.

42:24.977 --> 42:26.188
Let's go.

42:33.310 --> 42:36.183
- Are you sure?
- I... I don't know, I think so.

42:36.219 --> 42:39.468
Mrs. Rodney Strong. You
will be the toast of Toronto.

42:39.485 --> 42:41.023
- It hasn't happened yet.
- I know.

42:41.050 --> 42:43.153
- What if he is just having me on?
- Don't worry,

42:43.153 --> 42:45.598
- all you can do is look your best.
- (breaking glass)

42:46.284 --> 42:47.922
- Oh my God!
- Get out!

42:47.961 --> 42:49.665
- But I'm hardly decent...
- Get out! OUT!!

42:51.003 --> 42:52.752
HELP!!

42:55.253 --> 42:57.804
I'M BACK HERE! HELP!!

42:59.491 --> 43:00.974
JULIA!

43:03.470 --> 43:06.878
- (coughing)
- Help! HELP!

43:07.448 --> 43:08.876
I'm in here!

43:09.152 --> 43:12.123
Hello? Hello, are you in here?

43:12.300 --> 43:14.186
(coughing)

43:16.567 --> 43:18.023
AH!

43:18.059 --> 43:19.355
You're here.

43:20.185 --> 43:21.363
Good.

43:21.717 --> 43:25.259
Oh, don't despair. It's what you want.

43:25.733 --> 43:27.733
Both you and I know that.

43:29.426 --> 43:30.826
Join me.
