00:01.135 --> 00:01.269
.

00:05.706 --> 00:06.607
(Male announcer)
In the criminal justice system,

00:08.676 --> 00:12.180
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:12.213 --> 00:14.615
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.648 --> 00:16.584
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.617 --> 00:18.119
are members of an elite squad

00:18.152 --> 00:20.088
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:20.121 --> 00:22.290
These are their stories.

00:29.197 --> 00:31.732
Tonight on
America's Worst Crimes...

00:31.765 --> 00:34.168
We've heard
these stories before.

00:34.202 --> 00:37.371
A vicious rape on campus,
an unresponsive university.

00:37.405 --> 00:40.074
And yet, the details
of this particular story

00:40.108 --> 00:42.376
are even more horrifying
than usual.

00:44.212 --> 00:45.679
Just steps away
from the hectic heart

00:45.713 --> 00:49.750
of New York City
stands Hudson University,

00:49.783 --> 00:52.353
a venerable institution
of higher learning.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.422
A sanctuary of the mind.

00:54.455 --> 00:57.091
For a freshman--
we'll call her Jane--

00:57.125 --> 01:00.461
away from her small Midwestern
hometown for the first time,

01:00.494 --> 01:05.333
New York City and Hudson
were a dream come true.

01:05.366 --> 01:08.536
But Jane's dream was about
to turn into a nightmare.

01:09.703 --> 01:11.505
It started out
innocently enough.

01:11.539 --> 01:13.574
Bill was a popular athlete

01:13.607 --> 01:16.144
who seemed like
real boyfriend material.

01:17.245 --> 01:19.513
I thought he was
one of the good guys.

01:19.547 --> 01:21.815
But you were wrong.

01:21.849 --> 01:24.452
About everything.

01:24.485 --> 01:26.187
(Skip)
They went back to his room

01:26.220 --> 01:29.157
in one of the most popular
fraternities on campus.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.329
What started
as a romantic moment

01:35.363 --> 01:37.698
quickly took
a terrifying turn.

01:39.367 --> 01:41.502
Jane suddenly found herself
outnumbered

01:41.535 --> 01:44.238
by four men twice her size,

01:44.272 --> 01:46.707
all with malicious
intentions.

01:46.740 --> 01:50.144
I could not believe
he'd do this to me.

01:50.178 --> 01:53.181
(Skip)
But he did, didn't he?

01:53.214 --> 01:56.150
He set the whole attack up.

01:56.184 --> 01:58.752
And he gave his three friends
permission

01:58.786 --> 02:01.655
to do whatever
they wanted?

02:02.723 --> 02:05.293
(Jane)
At some point I just went numb.

02:05.326 --> 02:07.361
(Skip)
She was viciously gang-raped
for hours.

02:07.395 --> 02:09.797
Her anguished cries
for help went unanswered.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.699
No! No!

02:13.434 --> 02:17.271
I could tell
I wasn't even human to them.

02:17.305 --> 02:19.740
They took turns raping you.

02:19.773 --> 02:21.275
Yes.

02:21.309 --> 02:23.277
Sodomizing you.

02:23.311 --> 02:25.179
Yes.

02:27.315 --> 02:29.317
When they were done,
they...

02:29.350 --> 02:31.319
Okay, Noah,
just to be clear,

02:31.352 --> 02:33.487
you are not going
to Hudson University.

02:33.521 --> 02:35.289
No, no.
What do you want?

02:35.323 --> 02:36.757
(Skip)
I know this is difficult.

02:36.790 --> 02:37.925
Here you go, sweetie.

02:37.958 --> 02:40.728
They called me a whore.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.696
They called me a slut.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.800
They shoved me out of the door
like I was garbage.

02:48.302 --> 02:50.504
Did you call the police
or campus security?

02:50.538 --> 02:53.374
When I was up to it,
I went to the school.

02:55.609 --> 02:58.479
They asked me
if I had been drinking,

02:58.512 --> 03:01.315
if anyone could
corroborate.

03:01.349 --> 03:02.316
[phone rings]
Milk?

03:02.350 --> 03:03.517
(Jane)
They made me feel like

03:03.551 --> 03:05.553
I'd made a bad decision that
night, and it was my fault.

03:05.586 --> 03:08.256
Chief Dodds.

03:08.289 --> 03:10.824
America's Worst Crimes?
I'm actually just watching it.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.193
Uh, no, I-I hadn't
heard about it.

03:14.695 --> 03:17.231
[mutes TV]
The mayor's wife was watching?

03:17.265 --> 03:19.900
Well, that's just terrific.

03:19.933 --> 03:22.002
Yup.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.437
We're on it.

03:25.906 --> 03:29.910
But for Jane,
her ordeal had only just begun.

03:29.943 --> 03:33.314
More from this nightmare
on campus when we return.

03:35.783 --> 03:37.318
[sighs]

03:38.719 --> 03:41.689
[dramatic music]

04:24.298 --> 04:25.198
But for Jane,
her ordeal had only just begun.

04:26.066 --> 04:27.701
More from this--
[mutes TV]

04:27.735 --> 04:28.669
[groans]

04:28.702 --> 04:30.904
This is what you do
with your Sundays off?

04:30.938 --> 04:32.940
Me and Gracie Mansion,
apparently.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.041
And now, 1PP is pissed

04:34.074 --> 04:36.544
because they got caught
flat-footed on national TV.

04:36.577 --> 04:38.746
America's Worst Crimes
has a huge following.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.382
This is gonna go viral.
(Carisi) Yeah, I looked into it.

04:41.415 --> 04:42.950
The report says the attack
happened in December,

04:42.983 --> 04:44.852
but NYPD's got no record
of a complaint

04:44.885 --> 04:46.320
from the vic or Hudson U.

04:46.354 --> 04:48.656
She did say that Hudson
University ignored her.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.391
And God knows we've been
down that road before.

04:50.424 --> 04:52.092
I know that the tail
wags the dog,

04:52.125 --> 04:54.061
but these TV shows are in it
for the ratings.

04:54.094 --> 04:55.896
We don't know that
any of this even happened.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.030
(Carisi)
Yeah, I'm all for overtime,

04:57.064 --> 04:58.699
but don't we have
enough work to do?

04:58.732 --> 05:00.368
Guys, this isn't LMZ.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.936
It is a legitimate
national news magazine.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.105
They interviewed her.
She disclosed.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.375
And I got a call
from Dodds,

05:07.408 --> 05:09.076
who got a call
from the mayor.

05:09.109 --> 05:11.445
So we are going
to investigate.

05:11.479 --> 05:13.414
(Rollins)
We don't even know
who this girl is.

05:13.447 --> 05:14.615
America's Worst Crimes does.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.950
Don't make me talk
to reporters.

05:19.119 --> 05:20.888
(Skip)
Detectives.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.590
I'm guessing you're here
about the Hudson story.

05:22.623 --> 05:24.358
Yeah, well, you got
everybody talking,

05:24.392 --> 05:26.394
- including our bosses.
- Well, that's gratifying.

05:26.427 --> 05:29.397
And not just the Peabody buzz,
but for AWC to be in a position

05:29.430 --> 05:31.865
to amplify what's going on
behind those ivy walls.

05:31.899 --> 05:34.034
Yeah, well, you amplify,
we investigate.

05:34.067 --> 05:36.036
So we're going to need
to talk to Jane.

05:36.069 --> 05:37.705
Well, I'd love to help,

05:37.738 --> 05:39.106
especially with what that girl
had to suffer through.

05:39.139 --> 05:40.774
But I can't give you
her name.

05:40.808 --> 05:42.610
Your report says
she was gang-raped.

05:42.643 --> 05:44.478
Now's not the time to hide
behind the First Amendment.

05:44.512 --> 05:46.447
I'm not falling
on my journalistic sword.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.949
The only way Jane would talk
was if I promised her anonymity.

05:48.982 --> 05:51.084
She's scared to death
of those fraternity boys.

05:51.118 --> 05:52.720
We can find a judge
who will compel you

05:52.753 --> 05:54.588
to hand over your sources
and raw footage.

05:54.622 --> 05:56.790
All right, look, I'll kick
the footage request upstairs.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.125
That's not my call.

05:58.158 --> 06:00.027
As for Jane,
I can put you in touch

06:00.060 --> 06:02.129
with the woman
who shopped me the story.

06:02.162 --> 06:05.132
Maybe she can convince Jane
to talk to NYPD.

06:05.165 --> 06:07.635
Come on.

06:10.538 --> 06:11.972
(Dillon)
Really insightful work, Emma.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.807
(Rollins)
Professor Dillon? Hey.

06:13.841 --> 06:16.744
Detectives Rollins
and Detective Carisi.

06:16.777 --> 06:18.178
We're from SVU.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.813
- How can I help?
- We just, um...

06:19.847 --> 06:21.449
We wanted to talk to you
for a minute

06:21.482 --> 06:23.717
about the AWC segment
last night.

06:23.751 --> 06:26.587
Sure. I thought it was
important, what they did.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.556
I'm glad they started
the dialogue.

06:28.589 --> 06:29.990
Hey, listen, we were hoping
that you could

06:30.023 --> 06:31.759
get us in touch
with--with Jane.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.427
The reporter said
you introduced them.

06:33.461 --> 06:35.829
I thought it was crucial
her story be heard.

06:35.863 --> 06:40.434
But Jane already tried to
disclose once, to the school.

06:40.468 --> 06:41.368
You heard
how that turned out.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.537
Look, whatever happened
between the victim--

06:43.571 --> 06:44.805
Survivor.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.073
Okay, the survivor
and the university,

06:46.106 --> 06:47.508
that's got nothing
to do with us.

06:47.541 --> 06:48.876
You have to understand,

06:48.909 --> 06:50.744
this woman is still
extremely fragile.

06:50.778 --> 06:52.580
To subject her
to harsh scrutiny,

06:52.613 --> 06:54.748
- the legal system...
- All due respect, Professor,

06:54.782 --> 06:56.116
obviously we'd like
to go through you,

06:56.149 --> 06:57.618
but if you're just gonna
get in the way,

06:57.651 --> 06:59.487
we'll go over
or around you.

06:59.520 --> 07:02.656
Interesting phallocentric choice
of language, Detective.

07:02.690 --> 07:05.993
My partner is
still a work in progress.

07:06.026 --> 07:09.697
Listen, we all know
that something terrible

07:09.730 --> 07:11.699
happened to Jane.

07:11.732 --> 07:13.867
We don't want these guys
to get away with it.

07:13.901 --> 07:15.869
I hear you.
I do.

07:15.903 --> 07:20.708
I just don't think that Jane
wants to deal with any of this.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.876
But I'll give her a call.

07:25.012 --> 07:27.147
I see.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.216
All right,
thank you very much.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.686
[sighs]

07:32.720 --> 07:34.187
That was Professor Dillon.

07:34.221 --> 07:36.256
Jane says she's not
going to talk to us.

07:36.289 --> 07:39.560
That she'll come forward
when and where she wants.

07:39.593 --> 07:40.894
What does that mean?

07:40.928 --> 07:42.563
She's scared to make
an official complaint.

07:42.596 --> 07:43.864
And knowing what we know,

07:43.897 --> 07:45.799
I can't blame her.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.635
So that leaves us where?

07:47.668 --> 07:49.036
Back at square one.

07:49.069 --> 07:51.171
Dillon's no help.

07:51.204 --> 07:53.173
Hey, speaking of which,

07:53.206 --> 07:56.143
what was that crack about me
still being a work in progress?

07:56.176 --> 07:58.946
Oh, come on, Carisi.
The lady's a rape advocate.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.148
She's got a chip
about male detectives.

08:01.181 --> 08:04.985
I figured I could earn her trust
if I align myself with her.

08:05.018 --> 08:07.120
Hmm. Rape advocate.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.789
I don't even get
what that is.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.290
I mean, there's
no burglary advocate.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.092
There's no carjacking
advocates.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.629
When's the last time
a carjacking victim got asked,

08:15.663 --> 08:17.965
"Are you sure you didn't want
your car to get stolen?"

08:17.998 --> 08:19.800
Okay, I get that.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.301
- Hmm.
- All right.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.903
But still,
she's just getting in our way.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.939
Yeah, well, that's SVU.
Get used to it.

08:29.943 --> 08:32.145
- Where are you going?
- Back to campus.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.948
I don't want to tell the sarge
we came up empty-handed.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.151
[speaking Italian]

08:39.687 --> 08:41.689
No comment.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.824
Yes.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.158
Okay, good.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.860
Grazie, ciao.

08:46.894 --> 08:49.162
No comment to the Italian press?
They're on this already?

08:49.196 --> 08:51.765
I got to tell you, bad news
in New York travels fast.

08:51.799 --> 08:54.568
I mean, there are
already Twitter campaigns,

08:54.602 --> 08:58.105
calls for campus rallies
and revoking the frat's charter.

08:58.138 --> 09:00.340
Which explains why the mayor
and the D.A. are all over this.

09:00.373 --> 09:01.609
And me.

09:01.642 --> 09:03.777
So have you managed
to ID Jane yet?

09:03.811 --> 09:05.178
Look, Carisi's still trying,

09:05.212 --> 09:07.047
but the closest he
and Rollins have gotten

09:07.080 --> 09:11.051
is Jane's self-proclaimed
advocate, Professor Dillon.

09:11.084 --> 09:12.786
She's going to produce Jane?

09:12.820 --> 09:14.722
No.

09:14.755 --> 09:16.757
Look, Jane is scared
of fraternity retribution

09:16.790 --> 09:18.058
if she goes public.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.093
And she doesn't
trust the police.

09:20.127 --> 09:21.629
So she's not going to talk?

09:21.662 --> 09:23.931
I could subpoena the show
or this professor.

09:23.964 --> 09:26.066
There's got to be
an easier way.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.768
Jane said on the AWC piece

09:27.801 --> 09:29.637
that she disclosed
to the university.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.371
But they didn't
specify to whom.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.074
So let's go to the top
and find out.

09:34.107 --> 09:35.375
Okay. You want me
to come with?

09:35.408 --> 09:36.744
Not necessary.

09:36.777 --> 09:39.246
President Roberts and I
have history.

09:42.683 --> 09:45.118
I'm assuming this is about
that broadcast?

09:45.152 --> 09:46.654
It is.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.822
So the victim said
that she was shut down

09:48.856 --> 09:50.390
by the university.

09:50.423 --> 09:51.825
Do you know
who she spoke to?

09:51.859 --> 09:53.794
- I do. She spoke to me.
- Oh.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.763
I followed
the Department of Education

09:55.796 --> 09:58.265
sexual assault protocols
to the letter.

09:58.298 --> 09:59.800
And yet,
here we are

09:59.833 --> 10:02.235
investigating
an unreported gang-rape

10:02.269 --> 10:04.004
that occurred
on your watch.

10:04.037 --> 10:06.139
The first I heard of
any gang was on that show.

10:06.173 --> 10:07.708
When she came to me,

10:07.741 --> 10:09.176
she mentioned
only one individual.

10:09.209 --> 10:12.079
- And who was that?
- I'm not at liberty to say.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.714
These reports
are confidential.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.348
It's university policy.

10:15.382 --> 10:19.920
That anonymity ceases to exist
when a crime has been committed.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.822
What exactly
did she say?

10:21.855 --> 10:24.191
What she described was
regrettable drunken sex.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.392
Not rape.

10:25.425 --> 10:27.661
With four men
holding her down?

10:27.695 --> 10:30.263
She mentioned
one student only.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.733
She admitted
she was intoxicated.

10:32.766 --> 10:36.369
She went willingly back
to the fraternity with her date.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.972
I asked her whether she was sure
the sex wasn't consensual.

10:39.006 --> 10:41.208
She proceeded
to become defensive,

10:41.241 --> 10:42.710
and then she
left my office.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.878
And you didn't bother
to talk to her "date"?

10:44.912 --> 10:46.379
Actually, I did.

10:46.413 --> 10:48.682
He said the sex
was consensual.

10:48.716 --> 10:51.151
He seemed credible,
he's well-regarded,

10:51.184 --> 10:53.020
and has no prior
complaints.

10:53.053 --> 10:55.022
That was that.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.423
The next I heard of this
was last night

10:56.456 --> 10:58.692
when we were blindsided
on national television.

10:58.726 --> 11:00.460
Well, now that these
allegations have been made,

11:00.493 --> 11:02.863
I will need her name
and the name of the student

11:02.896 --> 11:04.765
that she claims
attacked her.

11:04.798 --> 11:06.767
(Protesters)
We are all Jane!

11:06.800 --> 11:09.703
We are all Jane!
We are all Jane!

11:09.737 --> 11:11.471
So...

11:11.504 --> 11:13.907
she hasn't come to you.

11:13.941 --> 11:15.709
Which means,
whatever happened,

11:15.743 --> 11:18.211
she hasn't filed
a criminal complaint,

11:18.245 --> 11:20.213
which means
my responsibility remains

11:20.247 --> 11:24.051
protecting the confidentiality
of both students.

11:24.084 --> 11:25.753
(Protesters)
We are all Jane!

11:25.786 --> 11:28.455
We are all Jane!
We are all Jane!

11:28.488 --> 11:30.423
We are all Jane!

11:30.457 --> 11:33.961
We are all Jane!
We are all Jane!

11:33.994 --> 11:35.929
Excuse me.

11:35.963 --> 11:38.766
I have a firestorm
on my hands.

11:38.799 --> 11:39.900
(Protesters)
We are all Jane!

11:39.933 --> 11:41.401
We are all Jane!

11:41.434 --> 11:43.771
- Hey, Sarge.
- Hey.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.906
So far on campus
nobody's been any help.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.775
Get anywhere
with President Roberts?

11:47.808 --> 11:49.142
You know,
it's the usual.

11:49.176 --> 11:51.411
First she blames
the victim a little bit,

11:51.444 --> 11:53.480
and then she hides
behind the cloak

11:53.513 --> 11:55.282
of protecting the students'
confidentiality.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.084
So we still don't even know
who the girl is?

11:57.117 --> 11:59.519
- No idea.
(girl) I was told that

11:59.552 --> 12:02.222
if my rapist made me
feel uncomfortable,

12:02.255 --> 12:06.760
I could switch classes
or move to another dorm.

12:06.794 --> 12:09.496
I kept my mouth shut,

12:09.529 --> 12:12.966
and he graduated
with honors last June.

12:14.802 --> 12:16.169
Now, for the first time,

12:16.203 --> 12:19.873
I'm speaking my truth,
because of Jane.

12:19.907 --> 12:21.809
[crowd cheering]

12:25.078 --> 12:26.546
Thank you.

12:26.579 --> 12:30.083
All your stories
have been so powerful.

12:30.117 --> 12:34.454
There is one last survivor
who wants to share her story.

12:34.487 --> 12:38.425
She's someone
you already know.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.460
[crowd cheering]

12:47.300 --> 12:48.869
Hi.

12:48.902 --> 12:52.405
Um, my name
is Heather Manning.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.245
I-I am the real Jane.

13:07.420 --> 13:10.023
I want to tell you my story.

13:11.191 --> 13:12.860
So much for anonymity.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.461
Yeah.

13:22.836 --> 13:23.203
(Benson)
Heather.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.473
Thank you so much
for coming in.

13:26.506 --> 13:29.609
I hope you realize this does not
mean we're pressing charges.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.345
- "We"?
- You know, Professor Dillon,

13:32.379 --> 13:34.848
we think it's probably best
if we speak with Heather alone.

13:34.882 --> 13:37.250
Actually, Sergeant,
could you and I talk?

13:37.284 --> 13:38.952
Um, sure.

13:38.986 --> 13:40.420
- Okay.
- This way.

13:40.453 --> 13:42.956
We just--we just want to get
Heather's side of the story.

13:42.990 --> 13:46.159
(Dillon)
I was worried about bringing
Heather to the police,

13:46.193 --> 13:48.428
being re-traumatized.

13:48.461 --> 13:50.931
But I've spoken to others
in the community,

13:50.964 --> 13:52.565
and they've all said
that if anyone's

13:52.599 --> 13:55.035
going to protect
a survivor, it's you.

13:55.068 --> 13:58.939
I will. And I promise you
that I will look after her.

13:58.972 --> 14:02.109
Heather was clear about
wanting me to sit in with her.

14:02.142 --> 14:04.477
She doesn't know you,
but she trusts me.

14:06.914 --> 14:09.382
December 12th.
I was on a date

14:09.416 --> 14:11.919
with an Alpha Zeta Pi
hockey player.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.225
Brian Mackey.

14:18.258 --> 14:19.526
He's the team captain.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.962
And--and the date
was at his frat?

14:21.995 --> 14:23.230
(Heather)
No, no.

14:23.263 --> 14:24.431
First we went to a bar,

14:24.464 --> 14:26.934
and then we went
back to the house.

14:26.967 --> 14:29.036
We were making out
in the hallway

14:29.069 --> 14:32.139
when he pulled me
into his room.

14:32.172 --> 14:33.506
Three guys were waiting.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.978
And they jumped me.

14:38.011 --> 14:40.113
Like a pack.

14:40.147 --> 14:42.449
And Brian led you in?

14:42.482 --> 14:44.217
He was in charge.

14:44.251 --> 14:48.155
He had two guys hold my legs
while he held my arms.

14:48.188 --> 14:49.889
And did you know
the others?

14:51.291 --> 14:53.927
His buddies
from the hockey team.

14:53.961 --> 14:57.197
I-I'm not sure I want
to tell you their names.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.532
Okay. Okay, well, we--
we can get back to that.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.701
No problem.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.670
And you were sure
that there were four men?

15:03.703 --> 15:05.305
Yes.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.674
Okay, because
President Roberts

15:07.707 --> 15:09.642
told us that
you only mentioned one.

15:09.676 --> 15:12.645
President Roberts
blamed Heather.

15:12.679 --> 15:15.582
She didn't feel safe
disclosing to her.

15:15.615 --> 15:17.550
Well, you're
safe here, Heather.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.219
Okay?

15:19.252 --> 15:21.654
All right,
so what happened next?

15:21.688 --> 15:23.991
Um...

15:24.024 --> 15:28.128
then they took turns raping me.

15:29.529 --> 15:32.265
Sodomizing me.

15:33.566 --> 15:35.335
Um, sorry.

15:35.368 --> 15:37.537
Go ahead.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.506
We didn't talk
about this part on TV.

15:39.539 --> 15:42.542
(Heather)
They used an object.

15:42.575 --> 15:45.212
The handle of a hockey stick.

15:45.245 --> 15:47.547
And then...

15:47.580 --> 15:50.617
And they high-fived each other
and they left me there.

15:56.523 --> 15:59.026
When I tried to pull
myself together and leave,

15:59.059 --> 16:02.095
the other guys in the frat
threw beer cans at me

16:02.129 --> 16:06.433
and they yelled at me
to go to church.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.435
They said that I should
call my dad and apologize

16:08.468 --> 16:10.670
for ruining his life.

16:10.703 --> 16:12.439
It was so horrible.

16:12.472 --> 16:13.640
Did you tell anyone?

16:13.673 --> 16:16.376
Did you tell your parents
or your roommate?

16:16.409 --> 16:18.445
My parents still don't know.

16:18.478 --> 16:19.779
Why is that?

16:19.812 --> 16:22.382
They're in the Central
African Republic,

16:22.415 --> 16:24.551
fighting malaria.

16:24.584 --> 16:28.188
Did you go to the doctor?

16:28.221 --> 16:30.623
Is there anyone to corroborate?

16:30.657 --> 16:32.059
Show them the text, Heather.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.526
Oh. Um...

16:33.560 --> 16:35.695
Brian sent me a text.

16:37.264 --> 16:39.166
His attempt
at an apology.

16:39.199 --> 16:40.467
Here.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.502
"Sorry about last night.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.237
"My boys were
out of control.

16:44.271 --> 16:46.306
But you deserve better
than what they did."

16:46.339 --> 16:47.707
This is great, Heather.

16:47.740 --> 16:50.810
So is there any other
physical evidence?

16:50.843 --> 16:53.413
Like, maybe the clothes
you were wearing?

16:53.446 --> 16:55.548
Anything like that?

16:55.582 --> 16:57.717
Um, actually,
one of the guys

16:57.750 --> 17:00.153
handed me
my panties back

17:00.187 --> 17:03.623
before class that Monday,
just to humiliate me.

17:03.656 --> 17:05.692
And you kept them?

17:05.725 --> 17:08.328
I shoved them
in my backpack,

17:08.361 --> 17:10.297
and then I threw them
in my drawer when I got home.

17:10.330 --> 17:12.132
- They might still be there.
(Benson) Okay, good.

17:12.165 --> 17:16.636
So if you decide to give us
the other boys' names,

17:16.669 --> 17:19.606
that will be enough
to get a DNA sample.

17:19.639 --> 17:23.610
It--it still won't be easy.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.812
No. It's okay.

17:25.845 --> 17:28.315
I want to.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.350
After the rally,
all those other women

17:30.383 --> 17:32.152
need to know that
they can do this too.

17:34.721 --> 17:35.522
Okay.

17:38.325 --> 17:40.427
The other names
were Connor Howell,

17:40.460 --> 17:43.463
Lance Mosconi,
and Zach Franklin.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.632
All on the hockey team.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.673
[indistinct chatter]

17:58.378 --> 17:59.679
This is where it happened.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.714
Pick up all cell phones,
laptops,

18:01.748 --> 18:03.216
bedding,
and hockey sticks.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.721
- NYPD.
- Glad to see you, officers.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.457
You here about the brick
coming through the window?

18:10.490 --> 18:11.791
Nice try.

18:11.824 --> 18:14.361
IDs, now.
Turn that music off.

18:14.394 --> 18:16.729
All right, we're looking
for Howell, Mackey,

18:16.763 --> 18:18.398
Mosconi, and Franklin.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.833
Yes, sir!
Ma'am.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.702
Guys, STFU. Come on.
I'm Brian Mackey.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.204
This is Connor Howell,

18:24.237 --> 18:25.738
Lance Mosconi.

18:25.772 --> 18:26.706
Franklin's out
of the country.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.408
(Rollins)
Thank you.
We have a warrant

18:28.441 --> 18:29.809
to search the premises,

18:29.842 --> 18:32.312
which means
all of you stay put.

18:35.682 --> 18:38.251
Somebody wants to hear my side
of the story? That's a first.

18:38.285 --> 18:39.786
Brian, between you and me,
there have been a lot of women

18:39.819 --> 18:41.421
doing a lot of talking.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.923
And sometimes, as guys,
our side gets lost.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.692
And I just want
to hear yours.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.660
Heather and I had sex.

18:47.694 --> 18:48.861
Consensual.

18:48.895 --> 18:51.398
Now, this went away months ago.
And now she goes on TV?

18:51.431 --> 18:52.632
Had Brian been dating
Heather for a while?

18:52.665 --> 18:55.168
Heather has wanted the business
from Brian since rush week.

18:55.202 --> 18:56.836
He finally threw her
a bone.

18:56.869 --> 18:58.571
Eight inches of it, brah.

18:58.605 --> 18:59.839
How do you know?

18:59.872 --> 19:01.574
You watch?

19:01.608 --> 19:03.410
(Brian)
Heather wanted to stay
and snuggle.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.812
But I was kind of done.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.814
So she just left?

19:07.847 --> 19:12.719
No, I did. She was upset.
You know, girls.

19:12.752 --> 19:14.587
Middle of the night,
she does her walk of shame.

19:14.621 --> 19:16.723
She kind of had
to run the gauntlet.

19:16.756 --> 19:19.592
What are we
talking about?

19:19.626 --> 19:22.329
You call her a whore,
you throw things.

19:22.362 --> 19:24.497
We didn't hurt her.

19:24.531 --> 19:25.732
Can't take the heat,
don't be a thot.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.400
You have sex with her?

19:27.434 --> 19:29.236
[scoffs]
And pick up Mackey's scraps?

19:29.269 --> 19:30.803
I don't think so.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.739
We're the ones getting
screwed here, all right?

19:32.772 --> 19:35.242
Search warrants,
a fricking vigil outside?

19:35.275 --> 19:36.709
Nobody raped this girl.

19:36.743 --> 19:39.279
Okay, well,
that search warrant

19:39.312 --> 19:41.481
includes collecting
your DNA.

19:44.384 --> 19:45.718
Open up.

19:46.953 --> 19:48.721
How was the boys' club?

19:48.755 --> 19:51.358
Gamey.
They're the victims.

19:51.391 --> 19:53.993
She's a whore that
woke up with regrets.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.862
Anybody admit
to consensual sex?

19:55.895 --> 19:58.531
Brian Mackey.
Connor and Lance deny.

19:58.565 --> 19:59.866
And what about
the fourth assailant?

19:59.899 --> 20:01.268
Zach Franklin.
He's 20.

20:01.301 --> 20:03.270
He's a multi-sport
scholar athlete.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.004
He's on a culture tour
of Cuba right now.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.407
- Can we get him back?
- From Cuba?

20:07.440 --> 20:10.910
Sarge, TARU just found a video
that Connor made that night.

20:10.943 --> 20:11.944
He erased it from his cell,
but they found it

20:11.978 --> 20:13.380
on his computer's hard drive.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.682
You're gonna want
to see this.

20:17.517 --> 20:19.652
(boys)
Go to church! Go to church!

20:19.686 --> 20:24.324
Go to church!
Go to church! Go to church!

20:24.357 --> 20:28.461
This has been another Connor
Howell slut-shaming video.

20:28.495 --> 20:30.397
That's harassment.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.332
It's ugly,
but it's not assault.

20:32.365 --> 20:35.335
We have semen matching
Connor and Brian's DNA

20:35.368 --> 20:37.470
on Heather's underwear.

20:37.504 --> 20:38.838
Anything on
the hockey sticks?

20:38.871 --> 20:40.473
Well, not after
three months,

20:40.507 --> 20:42.842
but between Brian's text
and Heather's testimony,

20:42.875 --> 20:43.910
you got enough.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.578
Enough for probable cause.

20:45.612 --> 20:46.813
Everyone wants these guys
put away,

20:46.846 --> 20:48.581
but this case
is three months cold.

20:48.615 --> 20:49.816
No rape kit.

20:49.849 --> 20:52.685
Heather's initial disclosure
mentioned only one assailant.

20:52.719 --> 20:54.053
President Roberts
shut her down.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.723
She can be extremely
intimidating, believe me.

20:57.824 --> 20:59.426
Heather knows
what she's in for?

21:01.928 --> 21:02.962
[sighs]

21:02.995 --> 21:05.332
Bring in the hockey team.

21:05.365 --> 21:08.501
There was no gang-rape,
okay?

21:08.535 --> 21:09.802
No assault.

21:09.836 --> 21:11.838
Then why text her this?

21:11.871 --> 21:13.973
"My boys were out of control.

21:14.006 --> 21:15.708
You deserve better
than what they did"?

21:15.742 --> 21:17.444
Look, I know the guys,
you know, like,

21:17.477 --> 21:19.846
messed with her
on the way out.

21:19.879 --> 21:21.080
I felt badly.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.049
The guys?
You were there too.

21:23.082 --> 21:24.917
That text was to check in
on a friend.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.586
That's not proof
of a criminal act.

21:26.619 --> 21:27.820
(Fin)
How about the others, Brian?

21:27.854 --> 21:29.522
We have DNA proof

21:29.556 --> 21:30.990
that you weren't
the only one.

21:31.023 --> 21:34.694
You do?
Then talk to them.

21:34.727 --> 21:36.062
Not me. I told you,

21:36.095 --> 21:37.630
I don't want to be
Brian's Eskimo brother.

21:37.664 --> 21:38.898
You're lying, Connor.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.800
We have your DNA
on Heather Manning's underwear

21:40.833 --> 21:42.602
- from that night.
- My DNA's all over that place.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.003
I live there.

21:44.036 --> 21:46.005
This underwear has
an evidentiary chain of custody

21:46.038 --> 21:48.074
from three months ago?
(Rollins) Ask your client.

21:48.107 --> 21:51.043
He handed it back to her
in class,

21:51.077 --> 21:52.645
in front of 20 students.

21:52.679 --> 21:54.080
Which explains the DNA,
doesn't it?

21:54.113 --> 21:55.948
Doesn't explain his semen.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.352
Lance, there's a reason
that you're here,

21:59.386 --> 22:01.988
and those other guys
are in the box.

22:02.021 --> 22:03.956
Because I didn't
do anything?

22:03.990 --> 22:05.925
Yeah, that's right.
I mean, you just--you watched.

22:05.958 --> 22:07.860
No, I wasn't even
in the room with her.

22:07.894 --> 22:09.629
Okay? I swear.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.364
Well, today's your lucky day,
because if you tell me

22:11.398 --> 22:13.733
who was in the room,
you could walk.

22:16.903 --> 22:18.905
You called Cuba?

22:18.938 --> 22:20.840
It's not like
I have pull there.

22:20.873 --> 22:22.842
Zach Franklin will be
arrested when he returns

22:22.875 --> 22:24.944
to American soil.
- If he does.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.880
[laughs]

22:27.914 --> 22:30.417
Hey, Connor, I was just
telling Detective Rollins here

22:30.450 --> 22:31.884
that we don't need
to talk to you anymore.

22:31.918 --> 22:33.753
Between the DNA
and one of your buddies

22:33.786 --> 22:36.489
putting you in the room
with Heather, you're done.

22:37.924 --> 22:42.061
[whispering indistinctly]

22:42.094 --> 22:43.129
Okay, look, I didn't want
to say this before,

22:43.162 --> 22:44.797
because I thought
it would look bad.

22:44.831 --> 22:45.865
Mm-hmm?

22:45.898 --> 22:46.899
But after she finished
with Brian,

22:46.933 --> 22:49.035
she moved on to me
like that.

22:49.068 --> 22:50.970
Her idea.
Totally consensual.

22:51.003 --> 22:52.972
I didn't rape her.

22:53.005 --> 22:54.541
Ask Brian.

22:54.574 --> 22:56.843
So he was there?
He saw you?

23:01.481 --> 23:05.084
Oh, Brian, you forgot to tell us
about your boy Connor.

23:05.117 --> 23:07.053
- What is this about?
- Connor just admitted

23:07.086 --> 23:08.921
that he had sex with Heather
right after you did.

23:08.955 --> 23:11.824
(Wolf)
How is that my client's problem?

23:11.858 --> 23:13.726
He said that you knew about it,
which means you lied to us.

23:15.194 --> 23:16.929
So what else
you been lying about?

23:16.963 --> 23:18.765
Brian, you don't need
to answer any more questions.

23:18.798 --> 23:21.000
No, I want to explain. I did see
Connor with her, but she w--

23:21.033 --> 23:22.068
Enough.

23:22.101 --> 23:24.170
Let him finish.

23:26.038 --> 23:28.941
For her to be acting
all prim and proper now?

23:28.975 --> 23:31.110
She wants to act
the whore on Saturday

23:31.143 --> 23:32.812
and play the virgin
on Sunday.

23:32.845 --> 23:34.113
(Wolf)
There you have it.

23:34.146 --> 23:36.649
Detectives, so far we've
extended every courtesy.

23:36.683 --> 23:37.850
But now it's time
for us to go.

23:37.884 --> 23:40.987
Or let's say you could sign
this, we could keep talking,

23:41.020 --> 23:42.188
and you can tell us
your side.

23:42.221 --> 23:45.492
And maybe we could clear
this whole thing up

23:45.525 --> 23:47.860
without it having to go
into the system, okay?

23:47.894 --> 23:51.531
A temporary arraignment waiver?
Get out of here with that.

23:51.564 --> 23:53.966
Unless my client's under arrest,
we're leaving.

23:56.102 --> 23:58.170
Okay, you two stay here.

23:58.204 --> 24:00.740
I'll see what my D.A.
wants to do.

24:03.643 --> 24:05.111
All three turned down
the waiver.

24:05.144 --> 24:06.746
Their lawyers think
letting them talk's just going

24:06.779 --> 24:08.114
- to make things worse.
- Good. Arraign them.

24:08.147 --> 24:09.816
The deeper into
the system they get,

24:09.849 --> 24:11.150
the harder it is
to pull them out.

24:11.183 --> 24:12.652
All right,
we'll load them up now.

24:12.685 --> 24:15.121
You know what?
Hold up a half-hour.

24:15.154 --> 24:18.658
Connor's a handsome boy
with a smug smile.

24:18.691 --> 24:22.028
Be good to get that face
on the 11:00 news.

24:23.796 --> 24:26.132
(reporter)
All right, here he comes.

24:26.165 --> 24:28.635
Hey, Bri?
[reporters shouting]

24:28.668 --> 24:30.136
Hey, Brian, this way.
Come here, Brian.

24:30.169 --> 24:33.239
Are you going to plead guilty?

24:33.272 --> 24:39.145
Connor, Brian,
why did you rape Jane?

24:39.178 --> 24:40.146
Are you the ringleader?

24:40.179 --> 24:41.981
You guys were involved, Connor!

24:49.522 --> 24:50.322
With us this morning
is Skip Peterson.

24:51.257 --> 24:52.091
He has an update now
on that shocking story

24:52.124 --> 24:54.561
of a gang-rape
at Hudson University.

24:54.594 --> 24:56.295
Skip, welcome.
I understand that the school

24:56.328 --> 24:59.932
has since suspended
all fraternity activities?

24:59.966 --> 25:01.901
Yes they have,
and last night NYPD

25:01.934 --> 25:04.537
arrested and arraigned three
of the accused rapists:

25:04.571 --> 25:06.873
Brian Mackey,
captain of the hockey team,

25:06.906 --> 25:10.743
and his teammates Connor Howell
and Lance Mosconi.

25:10.777 --> 25:13.746
And you had a chance to talk
to the victim, Jane?

25:13.780 --> 25:15.181
She's now bravely
come forward.

25:15.214 --> 25:16.348
Her real name
is Heather Manning.

25:16.382 --> 25:19.051
We caught up with her at
a campus rally late last night.

25:19.085 --> 25:21.621
I am gratified to hear
that three of the six men

25:21.654 --> 25:24.757
who attacked me were
arrested tonight by NYPD.

25:24.791 --> 25:26.092
[all cheering]

25:26.125 --> 25:29.562
What they did that night was
meant to dehumanize me.

25:29.596 --> 25:32.899
When they said,
"Who else wants to rape that?"

25:32.932 --> 25:35.334
they weren't
just assaulting me.

25:35.367 --> 25:39.572
They were assaulting
every woman on this campus.

25:39.606 --> 25:41.708
Did she just say
six men raped her?

25:41.741 --> 25:43.175
I thought it was four.

25:43.209 --> 25:44.977
Maybe she's counting
the guys in the video,

25:45.011 --> 25:47.013
the ones in the hall.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.748
I don't know.
Something feels off.

25:48.781 --> 25:51.183
"Who else wants to rape that?"

25:51.217 --> 25:53.352
Does that sound like something
even a frat boy would say?

25:53.385 --> 25:55.321
It's not what they said,
it's what they did.

25:55.354 --> 25:56.355
DNA don't lie.

25:56.388 --> 25:58.825
And you say there's more
information still to come?

25:58.858 --> 26:00.593
Sources have told me
that police confiscated

26:00.627 --> 26:02.762
a video of the assault,
and that hockey sticks

26:02.795 --> 26:04.931
used on her have tested
positive for DNA.

26:04.964 --> 26:07.366
(Jenna)
It's just horrifying.

26:07.399 --> 26:08.968
What about Heather?

26:09.001 --> 26:11.003
Her words are just
so powerful.

26:11.037 --> 26:12.371
You told me they didn't
find anything

26:12.404 --> 26:13.873
- on those hockey sticks.
- They didn't.

26:13.906 --> 26:16.008
And there's no video
of the assault.

26:16.042 --> 26:18.344
So who's his source?

26:18.377 --> 26:21.147
And why is Heather
even giving an interview?

26:21.180 --> 26:22.715
She's gone from
reluctant witness

26:22.749 --> 26:24.851
to being on every news show
in 48 hours.

26:24.884 --> 26:26.753
Once you tell your story,
it can be empowering.

26:26.786 --> 26:28.387
The floodgates open.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.922
They opened and let in
two extra assailants.

26:29.956 --> 26:31.691
- She's up to six.
- Right.

26:31.724 --> 26:34.661
When you're dealing with PTSD,
things come back in pieces.

26:34.694 --> 26:35.928
I will talk to her.

26:37.697 --> 26:39.699
In no way is this
about silencing you.

26:39.732 --> 26:42.034
But we're still
making our case.

26:42.068 --> 26:45.638
And we need to know that
the public speeches you've made

26:45.672 --> 26:48.841
won't contradict the statements
you've made to us.

26:48.875 --> 26:50.743
People need to know
what those boys did to her.

26:50.777 --> 26:54.914
Okay, but, first of all,
let's get clear on the who.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.916
You know who they are.
You arrested them.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.818
Are we really going
to start picking apart

26:58.851 --> 27:00.386
the survivor's story?

27:00.419 --> 27:01.788
This is exactly why we were
reluctant

27:01.821 --> 27:02.655
to come here
in the first place.

27:02.689 --> 27:04.223
(Benson)
I understand, Professor Dillon.

27:04.256 --> 27:06.325
But, Heather,
last night at the rally,

27:06.358 --> 27:09.428
you said that there were
six assailants.

27:09.461 --> 27:12.064
Are there two others
that we should be looking for?

27:12.098 --> 27:13.766
Look, I don't know exactly
what happened in that room.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.434
People were hiding
in the shadows,

27:15.467 --> 27:17.003
chanting, throwing things.

27:17.036 --> 27:19.171
- But the four you named--
- Absolutely raped me.

27:19.205 --> 27:20.940
Brian, Connor,
Lance, and Zach.

27:20.973 --> 27:22.441
I-I know Zach was there, because
they kept calling him Stinky,

27:22.474 --> 27:24.310
and he said,
"Dudes, my name is Zach."

27:24.343 --> 27:26.779
(Dillon)
Can I ask why Zach
wasn't picked up?

27:26.813 --> 27:29.181
Because he's in Cuba,
and they won't extradite.

27:29.215 --> 27:31.117
But we do have a warrant
out for his arrest.

27:31.150 --> 27:34.687
Good. And again,
I hope, going forward,

27:34.721 --> 27:37.289
that we can kick apart
their stories, not Heather's.

27:37.323 --> 27:38.858
(Benson)
We can, and we will.

27:38.891 --> 27:40.827
And I hope, going forward,

27:40.860 --> 27:43.462
Heather, that you'll stop
talking to the press

27:43.495 --> 27:46.733
and at rallies about this,
so we can do our job.

27:46.766 --> 27:48.467
You understand?

27:48.500 --> 27:50.770
There's only one problem
with that.

27:50.803 --> 27:52.939
Which is what?

27:52.972 --> 27:54.340
I'm supposed to go
on Anderson Cooper

27:54.373 --> 27:56.242
and Rachel Maddow tonight.

27:58.044 --> 27:59.712
Heather, you're going
to have to cancel those.

27:59.746 --> 28:01.413
(Dillon)
That's impossible.

28:01.447 --> 28:03.282
It's--it's too late.

28:03.315 --> 28:05.952
These issues are finally being
brought to national attention.

28:05.985 --> 28:08.855
The whole country is waking up

28:08.888 --> 28:10.790
to the rape epidemic
on our campuses.

28:10.823 --> 28:12.759
I thought that you said
that you wanted

28:12.792 --> 28:14.727
to bring your assailants
to justice.

28:14.761 --> 28:16.128
I did say that. I do.

28:16.162 --> 28:19.298
But this is so much more
than that now.

28:19.331 --> 28:21.801
I'm the face of a movement.

28:26.773 --> 28:29.742
She wants me to cancel
the interviews.

28:29.776 --> 28:30.676
(Fin) How'd that go?
- Not good.

28:30.709 --> 28:33.412
- She wants her story heard.
- Which one?

28:33.445 --> 28:35.314
Her story's
falling apart.

28:35.347 --> 28:37.817
Six guys, four guys,
hockey sticks, no DNA.

28:37.850 --> 28:40.386
She keeps talking, she's going
to torpedo her own case.

28:40.419 --> 28:42.822
(Fin)
Zach Franklin just surfaced
at his lawyer's office.

28:42.855 --> 28:45.291
He's about to go live
on LMZ right now.

28:45.324 --> 28:47.493
Folks, just let me know
when you're all ready,

28:47.526 --> 28:48.828
and we'll get this going.

28:48.861 --> 28:51.263
Hey, Liv, you know
about this?

28:51.297 --> 28:53.499
I'm John Buchanan,
attorney for Zach Franklin.

28:53.532 --> 28:55.401
Star athlete, scholar,

28:55.434 --> 28:58.304
and unequivocally innocent
of any and all charges

28:58.337 --> 29:00.840
in the so-called
Hudson University gang-rape.

29:00.873 --> 29:02.208
Of course he is.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.243
That's a big bluff,
even for Buchanan.

29:04.276 --> 29:05.878
Think he's got something?

29:05.912 --> 29:08.815
Tell them where you were
December 12th, 2014,

29:08.848 --> 29:12.151
the night of Heather Manning's
alleged assault.

29:12.184 --> 29:15.187
I was nine hours away,
in Kimball, West Virginia,

29:15.221 --> 29:17.189
on the W.V. Hillmen
soccer field.

29:19.125 --> 29:21.560
The championship game
was televised live

29:21.593 --> 29:24.797
on SEN until 11:40 p.m.
Eastern time.

29:24.831 --> 29:26.799
If you missed it,

29:26.833 --> 29:28.835
you'll be happy to hear
Hudson won, 3-zip.

29:28.868 --> 29:30.937
- Benson.
- We didn't vet this?

29:30.970 --> 29:33.806
He was in Cuba, Barba.
Remember?

29:33.840 --> 29:35.908
(Buchanan)
This was the exact time
Heather Manning

29:35.942 --> 29:38.077
was alleging my client

29:38.110 --> 29:41.948
was engaged in a heinous crime
against her.

29:41.981 --> 29:46.953
NYPD and the D.A. are
guilty of an outrageous

29:57.830 --> 29:58.831
Zach, tell them where you were
December 12th, 2014,

30:00.867 --> 30:02.401
the night of Heather Manning's
alleged assault.

30:02.434 --> 30:06.538
I was nine hours away,
in Kimball, West Virginia,

30:06.572 --> 30:08.540
on the W.V. Hillmen
soccer field.

30:08.574 --> 30:11.343
"Alleged assault"?
Heather was gang-raped.

30:11.377 --> 30:14.180
If that's true, Zach Franklin
was not involved.

30:14.213 --> 30:15.447
I could have sworn
he was there.

30:15.481 --> 30:17.850
It was dark,
but I heard his voice.

30:17.884 --> 30:19.986
Because you told us that they
called him by his nickname,

30:20.019 --> 30:22.989
that you heard him respond.

30:23.022 --> 30:25.124
Well, maybe that happened
in a nightmare.

30:25.157 --> 30:26.859
I haven't been sleeping.

30:26.893 --> 30:28.560
(Dillon)
Survivors have unclear memories.

30:28.594 --> 30:31.630
But the other boys are guilty.
You have their DNA.

30:31.663 --> 30:33.165
They're claiming
it was consensual.

30:33.199 --> 30:35.334
And you believe them
over Heather?

30:35.367 --> 30:37.636
Professor Dillon,
I think it's best

30:37.669 --> 30:39.171
if Heather speaks
to the A.D.A. alone.

30:39.205 --> 30:40.306
I disagree.

30:40.339 --> 30:42.241
I'm the only one
who's been here for her.

30:42.274 --> 30:43.910
(Barba)
You've advocated enough.
It's our turn.

30:43.943 --> 30:46.946
If you want this case
to continue,

30:46.979 --> 30:48.414
I need Heather to tell me
exactly what happened to her.

30:48.447 --> 30:50.016
And you need to tell
Detective Rollins

30:50.049 --> 30:51.417
exactly what Heather
disclosed to you.

30:51.450 --> 30:54.420
We told everything
to Skip Peterson.

30:54.453 --> 30:56.255
Mm-hmm. We're talking to him
right now too.

30:57.990 --> 31:01.093
I don't need you to tell me
this thing is blowing up.

31:01.127 --> 31:03.896
Hash tag "What else
did Skip skip?" is trending.

31:05.197 --> 31:06.532
I'm just as hurt by this
as you are.

31:06.565 --> 31:09.435
Look, our case
is collapsing.

31:09.468 --> 31:10.903
You took this on air.

31:10.937 --> 31:14.406
Now you need to give us
anything that you have

31:14.440 --> 31:15.942
that can corroborate
Heather's story.

31:15.975 --> 31:18.044
Your notes,
your interviews.

31:18.077 --> 31:19.278
I can't do that.

31:19.311 --> 31:21.047
We're way past
the coy shtick, Skip.

31:21.080 --> 31:22.381
You don't get it.
I can't corroborate,

31:22.414 --> 31:24.050
because I don't have
anything to do so with.

31:24.083 --> 31:26.185
Come on, you must have
talked to the boys?

31:26.218 --> 31:27.553
To people who saw
Heather the next day?

31:27.586 --> 31:29.288
- The school?
- No.

31:29.321 --> 31:32.658
I talked to Professor Dillon
and Heather, in that order.

31:34.961 --> 31:37.463
Isn't investigating
the main component

31:37.496 --> 31:39.098
of investigative journalism?

31:39.131 --> 31:42.301
Three boys have been arrested
and arraigned.

31:42.334 --> 31:45.437
Their reputations damaged,
possibly beyond repair.

31:45.471 --> 31:47.706
Now, I know that
that's on us, too, but--

31:47.739 --> 31:49.475
20/20 hindsight's easy.

31:49.508 --> 31:51.277
You sound like my producer.

31:51.310 --> 31:53.179
Should I have talked to them?
Obviously, yes.

31:53.212 --> 31:54.180
So why didn't you?

31:54.213 --> 31:55.681
Because I was protecting
Heather.

31:55.714 --> 31:56.848
She was terrified
of reprisals.

31:56.882 --> 32:00.519
And given Hudson's history,
she had every right to be.

32:00.552 --> 32:02.388
I found Heather
to be very credible.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.490
I have daughters her age.

32:04.523 --> 32:06.725
I have to say, I feel
gratified in some small way

32:06.758 --> 32:10.029
I helped start a dialogue about
the outrage of campus rape.

32:10.062 --> 32:11.998
(woman) Skip, five minutes.
- Then why didn't you

32:12.031 --> 32:13.632
start that dialogue
with a story that was true?

32:13.665 --> 32:17.069
Because most other stories
are more complicated.

32:17.103 --> 32:18.971
They're he-said, she-said.

32:19.005 --> 32:20.706
Heather's story
checked every box.

32:20.739 --> 32:23.409
Callous administration.
Entitled, white frat boy jocks.

32:23.442 --> 32:25.544
The pack mentality
gang-bang aspect.

32:25.577 --> 32:27.246
That's the story
I've been looking for.

32:27.279 --> 32:29.015
If we hadn't grabbed it,
someone else would have.

32:29.048 --> 32:30.649
Damn the consequences,
right?

32:30.682 --> 32:32.584
Don't blame the messenger,
blame the audience.

32:32.618 --> 32:34.120
Campus rape is
so commonplace,

32:34.153 --> 32:35.754
it doesn't even rise
to the level of news.

32:35.787 --> 32:38.590
Look what it took
to get anyone to even care.

32:38.624 --> 32:42.394
I'd love to do this all day,
but I have a retraction to tape.

32:42.428 --> 32:44.430
Let's go, guys.
Let's do it.

32:46.232 --> 32:48.667
I went on a date with Brian.

32:48.700 --> 32:50.436
We got a little drunk.

32:50.469 --> 32:53.639
Then we made our way
back to the frat.

32:53.672 --> 32:57.743
I thought he liked me,
but it went wrong.

32:57.776 --> 32:59.478
It was horrible.

32:59.511 --> 33:01.147
Focus on the facts.

33:01.180 --> 33:04.250
Did Brian lead you
into a dark room

33:04.283 --> 33:07.019
where three of
his brothers were waiting?

33:07.053 --> 33:09.021
His room was dark,

33:09.055 --> 33:12.191
but it was empty.

33:12.224 --> 33:14.360
At first.

33:14.393 --> 33:17.096
So Connor Howell and Lance
Mosconi weren't waiting there?

33:18.697 --> 33:21.067
Connor came in later.
I'm positive of that.

33:21.100 --> 33:22.301
And Lance?

33:22.334 --> 33:24.670
I don't know.

33:26.838 --> 33:29.408
I know he was outside,
but it was dark.

33:29.441 --> 33:33.412
I was drunk, confused.

33:33.445 --> 33:35.047
Confused about what?

33:38.417 --> 33:40.752
When Heather came to me,
she couldn't even articulate

33:40.786 --> 33:42.654
what had been done to her.

33:42.688 --> 33:44.823
That's how deep the culturally
imposed self-blame goes.

33:44.856 --> 33:49.195
Okay, what exactly
did she articulate?

33:49.228 --> 33:52.098
She told me
she'd been assaulted.

33:52.131 --> 33:54.166
Did she say
she was gang-raped?

33:54.200 --> 33:57.269
It was obvious
she'd been through hell.

33:57.303 --> 33:59.838
Professor Dillon told me
that I was so traumatized,

33:59.871 --> 34:03.075
it would take a while for me
to process what had happened.

34:03.875 --> 34:07.213
Heather...

34:07.246 --> 34:09.148
Did Brian Mackey rape you?

34:11.417 --> 34:12.784
I was drunk.

34:14.320 --> 34:17.289
He started
to have sex with me.

34:17.323 --> 34:20.426
He moved really fast.

34:20.459 --> 34:22.694
Did you move with him?

34:22.728 --> 34:25.331
I guess...

34:25.364 --> 34:28.400
In the beginning.

34:28.434 --> 34:32.204
So it's possible
it was consensual.

34:32.238 --> 34:33.139
I'm not sure.

34:35.607 --> 34:37.276
I passed out.

34:38.910 --> 34:42.548
When I woke up,
Connor Howell was on top of me.

34:44.150 --> 34:46.352
He was raping me.

34:46.385 --> 34:48.120
I absolutely
didn't want that.

34:52.258 --> 34:54.860
I remember Brian
coming back into the room.

34:57.229 --> 34:58.730
And the others?

35:00.232 --> 35:01.767
That night is a blur.

35:04.370 --> 35:07.439
Guys harassing me
as I left.

35:09.308 --> 35:11.610
When I told
Professor Dillon that,

35:11.643 --> 35:14.746
she said they probably
all took a piece of me.

35:17.249 --> 35:18.884
Professor Dillon
told you that?

35:23.189 --> 35:25.257
Can you wait here a minute?

35:25.291 --> 35:27.759
I need to know exactly
what you told Heather.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.195
What she already knew.

35:29.228 --> 35:30.862
It was barbaric
the way they abused her,

35:30.896 --> 35:34.166
- taunted her, assaulted her.
- But she was raped.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.867
Right? Is that what
she told you?

35:35.901 --> 35:37.236
By how many men?

35:37.269 --> 35:38.604
What difference
does that make?

35:38.637 --> 35:40.306
- Excuse me?
(Dillon) She was assaulted.

35:40.339 --> 35:41.940
Does it matter by whom,

35:41.973 --> 35:43.775
for how long,
in which orifice?

35:43.809 --> 35:46.278
Yes! Yes! It matters.

35:46.312 --> 35:48.380
We are talking about
criminal charges

35:48.414 --> 35:49.948
based on specifics
of what happened.

35:49.981 --> 35:52.318
It doesn't matter
what happened to her.

35:52.351 --> 35:54.620
What matters is
it happens every day.

35:54.653 --> 35:57.389
And these frat boys strut around
like they're bulletproof.

35:57.423 --> 36:00.792
So a few of them finally
have to take responsibility?

36:00.826 --> 36:03.829
Good. This isn't about you
or these boys or this case.

36:03.862 --> 36:05.030
This is bigger
than any of us.

36:18.710 --> 36:19.411
Our story,
"Nightmare on Campus,"

36:20.312 --> 36:21.980
generated international
media attention

36:22.013 --> 36:24.216
and inspired
a long-overdue discussion

36:24.250 --> 36:26.452
about campus sexual assault.

36:26.485 --> 36:28.820
However, it has now come
to our attention

36:28.854 --> 36:31.223
that many of
the disturbing allegations

36:31.257 --> 36:33.392
were fabricated
by Heather Manning.

36:33.425 --> 36:34.926
Did I miss
the actual apology part?

36:34.960 --> 36:37.996
Like many of you,
I believed Heather.

36:38.029 --> 36:39.898
That was a mistake.

36:39.931 --> 36:41.533
We have asked
an independent ombudsman

36:41.567 --> 36:43.001
from the Medill
School of Journalism

36:43.034 --> 36:45.471
to investigate
and issue a report

36:45.504 --> 36:48.607
about what we can do differently
in the future.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.809
An independent
investigation.

36:50.842 --> 36:52.711
They're throwing the book
at themselves.

36:52.744 --> 36:55.981
Barba's hanging by a string and
Dodds is hanging you out to dry.

36:56.014 --> 36:58.284
I don't blame him.
We moved too fast.

36:58.317 --> 36:59.618
We didn't vet it
hard enough.

36:59.651 --> 37:01.787
It's not on us.
It's not even on that haircut.

37:01.820 --> 37:03.822
It's on Heather.
She straight-out lied to us.

37:03.855 --> 37:05.657
Fin.

37:05.691 --> 37:07.659
Heather, can I help you?

37:10.662 --> 37:12.364
Once the story
got out there,

37:12.398 --> 37:15.701
I had all these survivors
coming to me and disclosing,

37:15.734 --> 37:18.404
counting on me
to be their strength.

37:18.437 --> 37:20.972
I couldn't just
take back my story.

37:21.006 --> 37:23.509
But your story
wasn't true, Heather.

37:23.542 --> 37:25.977
Brian may think
he didn't rape me.

37:26.011 --> 37:27.946
But we were both drunk.

37:27.979 --> 37:30.349
Professor Dillon told me
that that means

37:30.382 --> 37:32.284
that I wasn't capable
of consenting.

37:32.318 --> 37:35.721
She also said
that once I passed out,

37:35.754 --> 37:37.656
there's no way to know
what happened to me.

37:37.689 --> 37:39.458
I could have
been gang-raped.

37:39.491 --> 37:42.694
But we can't make that case.

37:42.728 --> 37:43.962
What about Connor?

37:43.995 --> 37:46.365
I know he raped me.

37:46.398 --> 37:47.633
Brian left.

37:47.666 --> 37:51.002
And I was passed out.
I was half-naked.

37:51.036 --> 37:55.341
And then I came to
because Connor was raping me.

37:55.374 --> 37:57.876
Hard, violent.

38:01.613 --> 38:02.781
Did anybody else see?

38:02.814 --> 38:06.318
Yes. Brian came in.
He saw everything.

38:08.654 --> 38:11.089
And then he just turned
and walked away.

38:11.122 --> 38:12.624
Like you're doing now.

38:16.995 --> 38:18.897
I believe you, Heather.

38:19.998 --> 38:22.934
But a jury is going
to have reasonable doubt.

38:26.972 --> 38:29.641
So that's it?

38:29.675 --> 38:32.944
I have to go to school
every day and see my rapist?

38:34.012 --> 38:36.081
I'm sorry, Heather.

38:36.114 --> 38:39.885
I'm sorry about all of it.

38:39.918 --> 38:41.887
And if there was
something I could do

38:41.920 --> 38:44.490
to go back and change it,
I would.

38:44.523 --> 38:47.793
[crying]

38:47.826 --> 38:49.361
[quietly]
But at this point...

38:50.962 --> 38:53.599
There's nothing we can do.

39:00.606 --> 39:03.041
Your Honor, given
the collapse of this case,

39:03.074 --> 39:04.476
we move for a dismissal
of all charges

39:04.510 --> 39:05.877
against the four defendants.

39:05.911 --> 39:07.746
How say you, Mr. Barba?

39:07.779 --> 39:09.681
We are prepared
to drop the charges.

39:09.715 --> 39:12.050
(Judge Pepitone)
Against all four of the accused?

39:12.083 --> 39:14.486
Yes, Your Honor.
All four.

39:14.520 --> 39:19.057
Assuming no other holds,
you are free to go, gentlemen.

39:19.090 --> 39:20.859
Thank you,
Your Honor.

39:31.537 --> 39:33.004
[scoffs]

39:35.474 --> 39:39.044
I believed Heather.
I still believe Heather.

39:39.077 --> 39:42.047
We all know something horrible
happened to her that night,

39:42.080 --> 39:44.883
but until rape culture
changes in this country,

39:44.916 --> 39:47.085
none of us will be safe.

39:47.118 --> 39:50.556
And that was just part
of the outrage on campus today

39:50.589 --> 39:52.190
as students reacted
to the news

39:52.223 --> 39:54.526
that the D.A. has dropped
the charges

39:54.560 --> 39:55.927
against all four defendants

39:55.961 --> 39:57.929
in the Hudson University
gang-rape case.

39:57.963 --> 40:00.098
Meanwhile, an attorney
for the former defendants

40:00.131 --> 40:02.133
will be filing a lawsuit

40:02.167 --> 40:05.070
against Hudson University and
the NYPD early next week.

40:05.103 --> 40:06.171
Turn that off.

40:06.204 --> 40:08.707
Well, we should feel proud.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.208
Pumped up their ratings
for another week,

40:10.241 --> 40:12.043
and those boys will never get
their reputations back.

40:12.077 --> 40:14.112
Yeah, but that's the job,
Carisi.

40:14.145 --> 40:17.015
It's hard to know what actually
happened in cases like these.

40:17.048 --> 40:19.585
If you can't take that,
SVU isn't right for you.

40:19.618 --> 40:22.153
Nah, I get it.
I'm good here.

40:22.187 --> 40:24.089
Let's hope Liv is.

40:24.122 --> 40:26.625
Right now she's heading up
to Hudson U.

40:26.658 --> 40:30.161
Round three of the apology tour.

40:30.195 --> 40:31.763
Given everything
that's happened,

40:31.797 --> 40:35.233
I wanted to apologize
for my tone a few days back.

40:35.266 --> 40:37.135
We were both
taken advantage of,

40:37.168 --> 40:38.904
and we both
had blinders on.

40:38.937 --> 40:42.240
You know, it was
the perfect story.

40:42.273 --> 40:44.976
It confirmed all of
my preconceived notions.

40:45.010 --> 40:48.113
And that alone should have
made me approach it

40:48.146 --> 40:49.848
with more skepticism.

40:49.881 --> 40:51.683
And, to be honest,
I can't help but ask

40:51.717 --> 40:53.084
if I'd listened
to Heather

40:53.118 --> 40:54.720
instead of badgering her
with questions

40:54.753 --> 40:56.254
if this wouldn't have
ended differently.

40:56.287 --> 40:57.188
Maybe.

40:57.222 --> 40:59.925
Maybe she would have
told you the true story.

41:01.159 --> 41:05.463
Connor Howell
did actually rape Heather.

41:07.298 --> 41:11.236
You have a dangerous predator
on your campus.

41:11.269 --> 41:12.938
And now that he's
gotten away with it,

41:12.971 --> 41:15.106
he'll likely be emboldened.

41:15.140 --> 41:17.242
And you can't prosecute,

41:17.275 --> 41:19.110
but you want me
to discipline him?

41:19.144 --> 41:23.148
I'm asking you
to do what you can.

41:23.181 --> 41:26.718
A lot less than I
could have last week.

41:26.752 --> 41:28.887
We had an incident
last night.

41:28.920 --> 41:31.723
The first thing the accused
said to campus security was,

41:31.757 --> 41:35.060
"She's lying just like
Heather Manning."

41:37.295 --> 41:40.231
I don't blame Heather.

41:40.265 --> 41:43.134
Skip Peterson
and Professor Dillon,

41:43.168 --> 41:46.071
they--they pressured her
into coming forward.

41:48.073 --> 41:48.974
They thought
this would be the case

41:49.007 --> 41:52.544
that would change
rape culture and it did.

41:54.646 --> 41:54.713
It set the clock back
30 years.
