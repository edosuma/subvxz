Previously on <i>Damages...</i>

00:02.739 --> 00:06.032
<i>I saw your client on</i> <i>Charlie Rose;</i>
his English is better than his French.

00:06.096 --> 00:11.474
Mr. Coupet, did you personally oversee the
development of a vaccine called Tranzec?

00:11.574 --> 00:16.047
He's my only child. He left me with
his baby daughter to take care of.

00:16.133 --> 00:18.626
Michael's suing me for
custody of Catherine.

00:18.707 --> 00:20.483
You think the CIA set Nasim up?

00:20.532 --> 00:21.596
Your witness was arrested right in

00:21.673 --> 00:23.194
the middle of a
deposition against High Star.

00:23.275 --> 00:25.314
Had to be the CIA.

00:25.387 --> 00:27.725
Assume they'll be listening in
on every phone call you make.

00:27.808 --> 00:29.801
This is the guy.
He came to see Mr. Marwat.

00:29.865 --> 00:31.286
- Are you sure?
- Definitely.

00:31.352 --> 00:32.580
You were
responsible for knowing

00:32.659 --> 00:35.229
everything that happened
on the ground over there.

00:35.304 --> 00:37.302
I saw you once in
Afghanistan, just before the

00:37.363 --> 00:39.122
mission where Chris'
men were killed.

00:39.197 --> 00:40.546
Did you tell the lawyers?

00:40.607 --> 00:42.768
Yes, I told them, but
they don't know who you are.

00:42.844 --> 00:45.148
Why didn't you tell
me you'd come to New York?

00:45.212 --> 00:47.694
It was a last-minute assignment.

00:47.751 --> 00:49.263
I'm worried
about Chris Sanchez.

00:49.342 --> 00:51.028
Who knows what he's
going to say in court.

00:51.100 --> 00:53.329
He doesn't have to say
anything if he doesn't appear.

00:53.408 --> 00:55.603
Afghanistan is a
war zone, Howard.

00:56.200 --> 00:57.502
Anything can happen.

"I'm Worried About My Dog"

02:22.800 --> 02:25.718
I seen you before.

02:37.818 --> 02:39.106
What were you thinking about?

02:43.268 --> 02:45.161
Mm... no, nothing.

02:48.413 --> 02:51.544
You were talking about the
incident, and then you just drifted away.

02:53.249 --> 02:54.564
"The incident"?

02:55.713 --> 02:59.336
Mm. Why don't you just
walk me through it again?

03:00.161 --> 03:02.008
Step by step.

03:03.375 --> 03:06.510
I was leaving for work.

03:08.312 --> 03:11.782
I stepped out of the elevator
and entered the lobby.

03:12.615 --> 03:14.749
My doorman started
to talk to me.

03:15.601 --> 03:24.252
He was going on and on about the weather,
and I was trying to ignore him, because...

03:27.748 --> 03:30.020
Because? Because what?

03:31.770 --> 03:33.638
Because I was on the phone.

03:34.785 --> 03:36.176
Who were you speaking to?

03:38.497 --> 03:40.186
Yale Law School.

03:41.446 --> 03:43.551
And what was
the conversation about?

03:45.295 --> 03:49.746
My law partner,
three years ago.

03:50.752 --> 03:54.825
He died. Tom.

03:55.139 --> 04:00.104
I was trying to set up a
scholarship in his name.

04:00.726 --> 04:02.055
That's nice.

04:03.061 --> 04:04.502
Were you able to?

04:06.199 --> 04:07.494
No.

04:07.688 --> 04:12.738
Got caught up in red tape and
university politics, so...

04:15.885 --> 04:17.880
Anyway, that was the
call I was making.

04:18.570 --> 04:20.199
So maybe that's
why you were angry.

04:20.452 --> 04:24.228
Tom... Tom was obviously
very important to you.

04:29.052 --> 04:34.427
Well, at your age, leaving a legacy...
starts to become important.

04:36.006 --> 04:38.113
You start thinking
about your mortality.

04:38.210 --> 04:39.392
Mortality?

04:41.181 --> 04:42.984
How old do you think I am?

04:43.116 --> 04:46.182
It's not your age
I'm talking about, it's more

04:46.266 --> 04:52.086
this... this phase in your life, where
you've become extremely successful.

04:52.399 --> 04:54.920
Powerful.
Mastered your profession.

04:56.281 --> 04:58.381
It becomes important to
kind of pass that on.

05:01.600 --> 05:03.676
So, what would you
like to do next?

05:05.660 --> 05:08.546
Well, I don't spend much
time thinking about what's next.

05:08.683 --> 05:11.608
But I'd imagine that
you'd like your firm to live on,

05:12.163 --> 05:13.672
after you've stepped away.

05:16.346 --> 05:18.982
Well, my son would
have made a brilliant lawyer.

05:20.124 --> 05:24.764
He has a first-rate mind.
But he refuses to use it.

05:25.819 --> 05:27.912
So he's not going
to carry on the legacy.

05:28.236 --> 05:33.393
He's suing me
for custody of my granddaughter.

05:34.460 --> 05:38.378
Is there anyone else?

05:39.827 --> 05:40.931
Nope.

05:41.702 --> 05:44.385
You've spoken in the
past about a young attorney.

05:44.562 --> 05:45.876
A woman.

05:46.850 --> 05:49.334
You weren't sure why you
were keeping her around.

05:49.956 --> 05:51.042
Yeah.

05:53.688 --> 05:55.618
Did you ever
end up helping her?

05:56.810 --> 05:58.107
I did.

06:00.808 --> 06:02.436
Well, that's interesting.

06:08.997 --> 06:09.975
Go, come on.

06:12.408 --> 06:15.819
That whole side will be demolished
to make room for the new barracks.

06:16.186 --> 06:17.511
Are you
guys going to use dynamite?

06:17.598 --> 06:19.520
Doubtful.
Probably bulldoze it.

06:19.715 --> 06:21.483
Can I drive the bulldozer?

06:21.579 --> 06:22.786
We'll see, bub.

06:23.179 --> 06:25.672
I brought you guys to see this
before it was demolished so when

06:25.738 --> 06:30.458
we come back, you'll understand
what hard work means.

06:30.545 --> 06:31.903
What progress is.

06:32.056 --> 06:36.871
Because if you're not moving forward in
life, boys, you're moving backwards.

06:37.027 --> 06:39.719
There's no in-between.
You understand?

06:39.805 --> 06:41.041
Yes, sir.

06:41.871 --> 06:43.835
Oh, man,
you guys gotta see this!

06:44.659 --> 06:45.777
What is it?

06:47.034 --> 06:49.364
Hey, guys?
Guys, don't go in there!

06:49.604 --> 06:52.540
Boys, don't go in there!
Come back. Come back!

06:55.430 --> 06:57.260
His name is Chris.

07:02.150 --> 07:03.582
What are you doing here?

07:03.765 --> 07:05.326
Your dad brought me.

07:08.587 --> 07:10.476
Did you do something wrong?

07:13.500 --> 07:15.463
Your father thinks I did.

07:15.631 --> 07:17.135
What did you do?

07:20.632 --> 07:22.106
Ask your dad.

07:31.845 --> 07:33.583
What did he do, Dad?

07:34.822 --> 07:36.392
I don't know this man.

07:39.488 --> 07:41.025
Guys, come here.

07:41.190 --> 07:44.540
It's okay, I...
I just want to tell you something.

07:49.910 --> 07:51.396
Your dad...

07:54.468 --> 07:56.264
is gonna kill me.

08:04.649 --> 08:05.810
Dad?

08:15.609 --> 08:17.939
Hey, pal.

08:19.048 --> 08:20.072
What's wrong?

08:20.159 --> 08:24.606
I just dozed off for a
minute; I'm all right. How'd it go?

08:24.782 --> 08:27.326
Well...
I won.

08:28.809 --> 08:32.000
Won what?
I thought this was just a practice.

08:32.066 --> 08:33.491
No, today
was the wrestle-off.

08:33.602 --> 08:35.629
Oh! Oh, right.

08:35.715 --> 08:37.306
Yeah, I finally beat Dravecki!

08:37.395 --> 08:39.169
I'm gonna be in the
meet on Friday, Dad.

08:39.544 --> 08:41.717
You'll get to see me
in competition now.

08:42.674 --> 08:44.505
Yeah, I might
be able to make that.

08:44.937 --> 08:46.374
What do you mean, might?

08:48.353 --> 08:51.515
I have some things going
on at work. This isn't a great time.

08:51.938 --> 08:53.080
Okay.

08:59.282 --> 09:00.813
Let's go get some chow.

09:22.775 --> 09:24.529
How long have I been here?

09:25.532 --> 09:26.811
About a month.

09:38.303 --> 09:40.326
I'm worried about my dog.

09:43.518 --> 09:45.859
You think you could find
out how she's doing?

09:50.055 --> 09:52.127
I left her with Ellen Parsons.

09:52.221 --> 09:54.052
You think we're going
to talk to your lawyer?

09:54.941 --> 09:58.103
I'm just asking about the...
my dog.

10:01.426 --> 10:02.570
Sorry.

10:09.528 --> 10:11.373
Where does
this end, A.C.?

10:17.835 --> 10:19.331
You gonna kill me?

10:23.532 --> 10:26.257
'Cause you-you can't
keep me in here forever.

10:32.193 --> 10:37.330
Yeah. Of course you
don't know how it ends.

10:39.275 --> 10:43.510
Of course, 'cause you just
take orders from Erickson.

10:45.604 --> 10:47.823
You're like his fucking slave.

10:52.182 --> 10:53.748
Fuck you.

10:54.857 --> 10:56.922
You must be getting
paid a fuckload, huh?

10:57.026 --> 10:58.811
I don't work
for him for the money.

11:00.483 --> 11:03.556
You think what we
did is helping win the war?

11:07.935 --> 11:11.460
Dust Devil was
about national security.

11:12.531 --> 11:15.053
When I put you in charge of that
unit, you said you understood that.

11:15.140 --> 11:17.704
You told me that you
were committed.

11:19.971 --> 11:21.536
Why you gave me this?

11:22.540 --> 11:23.500
Hmm?

11:24.132 --> 11:28.848
Because we had an understanding
that we'd do what it takes.

11:32.490 --> 11:34.579
I got those for my men.

11:38.158 --> 11:40.988
I gave it to you 'cause I
thought you were one of us.

11:41.991 --> 11:43.503
You're not.

11:49.345 --> 11:51.734
You don't have any fucking men.

11:58.946 --> 12:02.405
Erickson never told you who we
pulled out of that last mission, did he?

12:02.496 --> 12:08.759
You know I never asked.
Because it's not my job to know.

12:18.717 --> 12:20.828
So this is the guy?
You sure?

12:20.942 --> 12:24.365
He was seen at the detention
center questioning Nasim Marwat.

12:24.749 --> 12:26.963
Then, lo and behold,
Nasim gets deported.

12:27.656 --> 12:28.587
Hmm.

12:28.726 --> 12:30.351
Can you get his name for us?

12:30.510 --> 12:32.299
You want me to out a CIA agent?

12:36.142 --> 12:40.347
This is dangerous territory.
My advice is forget about this.

12:40.804 --> 12:42.482
Well, that's not an option.

12:43.214 --> 12:44.679
What do you
hope to get out of it?

12:46.362 --> 12:50.594
You can't beat the CIA.
Believe me, I tried.

12:52.642 --> 12:58.511
Bill, if you can get
information on this man, we may

12:58.598 --> 13:02.384
be able to pressure him into
turning against Howard Erickson.

13:05.472 --> 13:07.591
So not just a name you want.

13:08.114 --> 13:09.498
You want dirt against this guy?

13:09.585 --> 13:11.196
Anything you can get.

13:12.981 --> 13:15.466
We know that you have
a contact at the agency.

13:19.030 --> 13:20.957
I'm not-- I'm not
going to promise anything.

13:21.464 --> 13:23.375
I mean, you guys are nuts.

13:32.582 --> 13:34.887
Did he really
try and take on the CIA?

13:36.198 --> 13:40.697
15 years ago, Bill
went down to D.C. on a

13:40.774 --> 13:43.318
corruption case
involving the Pentagon.

13:43.961 --> 13:46.131
Then he realized the
CIA was involved.

13:46.625 --> 13:47.940
What happened?

13:52.454 --> 13:53.918
He took them on.

13:54.227 --> 13:56.620
They pushed back hard.
They played dirty.

13:57.943 --> 14:00.991
Eventually, he realized that
he'd have to do the same thing.

14:01.073 --> 14:02.410
So...

14:05.431 --> 14:07.628
He concocted false evidence.

14:10.111 --> 14:11.540
Was caught.

14:12.308 --> 14:13.736
And that's
why he was disbarred?

14:14.716 --> 14:16.311
Yeah.

14:19.348 --> 14:20.158
Yes?

14:20.259 --> 14:22.326
- Miss Hewes, your car is here.
- Thank you.

14:24.968 --> 14:28.193
I'm afraid I'm not going to be around
much the next couple of days.

14:28.374 --> 14:30.783
- Pharmaceutical case?
- Yeah, I can't put it off any longer.

14:30.858 --> 14:33.867
The trial date's coming on, and I have to
keep moving on the depositions, so...

14:33.948 --> 14:35.652
No problem. I'm fine.

14:35.735 --> 14:37.441
I've got a meeting with the
plaintiffs, and hopefully Bill

14:37.514 --> 14:40.935
will come up with something.
So, I'll let you know.

15:13.952 --> 15:15.333
Jesus!
Who the fuck is that?!

15:15.426 --> 15:16.912
Our target.
We're pulling him out.

15:16.997 --> 15:19.074
He's got valuable information.

15:20.172 --> 15:21.855
Make sure the
perimeter is secure.

15:21.968 --> 15:23.337
We're taking him out of here.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.032
It's just you and me, you know.

16:23.413 --> 16:26.235
I have a deposition to go to.
I don't have a lot of time.

16:26.964 --> 16:28.485
You asked me here.

16:31.233 --> 16:33.052
I got your summons.

16:39.640 --> 16:42.170
You do not want to
sue me for custody.

16:42.262 --> 16:43.790
Of my own daughter?

16:43.899 --> 16:47.931
I think I do. I asked you nicely
if I could meet her.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.166
You said no.
You left me no option.

16:51.290 --> 16:54.690
Michael, you will lose.

16:56.156 --> 16:59.767
You will be humiliated.
It will probably destroy you.

17:03.930 --> 17:06.635
I'm not going
to lie down for you.

17:08.218 --> 17:10.694
You deserted your child.

17:12.348 --> 17:15.431
Face that reality
and live with it.

17:16.315 --> 17:18.487
Do you think
you're facing reality?

17:19.128 --> 17:21.317
Have you really
thought this through?

17:21.410 --> 17:25.131
I'm late.
Nothing more to say.

17:25.694 --> 17:27.270
What if you die?

17:29.445 --> 17:32.480
If something happens to you, who's
going to take care of Catherine?

17:35.683 --> 17:39.487
And when she gets older and asks about her
dad, what are you going to tell her?

17:43.319 --> 17:47.033
You lied to me about my father until
I was almost out of high school.

17:48.352 --> 17:50.051
I know how it feels.

17:50.757 --> 17:53.452
That was a totally
different situation.

17:53.548 --> 17:59.907
You don't get to make
the rules, Mom. There's the law.

18:00.191 --> 18:02.609
And I'm going to use
it to get what's mine.

18:12.397 --> 18:13.823
See you in court.

18:15.309 --> 18:20.031
I missed Christmas
and her birthday.

18:21.640 --> 18:27.080
It's small, but I was hoping you would
give this to Catherine for me.

18:38.478 --> 18:40.179
An economist at the
state college said that the

18:40.266 --> 18:43.320
expansion's going to add a thousand
news jobs to the local economy.

18:43.437 --> 18:44.348
You sound like a man who's

18:44.431 --> 18:47.523
considering a run for
elected office, Howard.

18:47.715 --> 18:49.173
Politics?
Not on your life.

18:49.259 --> 18:50.909
- Hallelujah.
- None of this would

18:50.958 --> 18:53.831
have been possible if you hadn't have
gotten those contracts renewed.

18:53.930 --> 18:55.917
Just holding up
my end of the bargain.

18:56.750 --> 18:59.688
The agency is grateful
for your assistance.

19:01.177 --> 19:05.077
So that witness--
We're in the clear now?

19:05.138 --> 19:08.979
Mr. Nasim Marwat has
signed a statement denying any

19:09.049 --> 19:12.286
knowledge of the mission, in
exchange for a ticket home.

19:12.373 --> 19:13.430
You had him deported?

19:13.505 --> 19:15.100
Gone! Bye-bye.

19:15.193 --> 19:17.776
You should have no problem
getting the case dismissed.

19:22.011 --> 19:23.752
There's still Chris Sanchez.

19:27.151 --> 19:31.918
Either he agrees to keep
his mouth shut, or he doesn't.

19:32.548 --> 19:34.869
- There's no in between.
- Yeah, I know.

19:35.371 --> 19:38.845
Sooner or later, you got
to figure out what to do with him.

19:47.218 --> 19:48.644
Flowers for me?

19:49.252 --> 19:53.632
Ah, this is a cemetery, so try
to look like you're here for a reason.

19:53.731 --> 19:55.402
And, uh, walk slowly.

19:58.479 --> 20:01.357
So is your contact
willing to help us?

20:01.955 --> 20:03.246
He wants to see you first.

20:03.326 --> 20:04.775
He wants to know who
he's dealing with.

20:04.856 --> 20:06.281
Okay, well, when can I see him?

20:06.472 --> 20:07.946
He's right over there.

20:15.389 --> 20:17.422
Well, what are you waiting for?
Go ahead.

20:37.642 --> 20:41.521
Christ, are you even
out of law school?

20:42.113 --> 20:44.557
Bill didn't tell me
there was an age requirement.

20:44.654 --> 20:47.857
If Patty Hewes didn't
have your back...

20:48.459 --> 20:50.570
I wouldn't even be
talking with you.

20:51.520 --> 20:55.532
Good to know.
Can you help me or not?

20:56.949 --> 20:59.257
Understand what we're
talking about here.

20:59.572 --> 21:03.676
If I give you information about
this man and anyone finds out,

21:04.086 --> 21:05.502
I will lose my job.

21:05.629 --> 21:08.938
I'll be branded a traitor
and very likely go to jail.

21:09.802 --> 21:11.850
I won't go public
with the information.

21:13.637 --> 21:15.559
I can't even use it in court.

21:15.654 --> 21:16.970
Then what do you want it for?

21:17.217 --> 21:21.012
To get to High Star.
Howard Erickson is my target.

21:25.732 --> 21:29.210
My involvement can
never be disclosed.

21:29.660 --> 21:32.395
We never met. We never spoke.

21:32.789 --> 21:35.649
We never had any
contact whatsoever.

21:35.782 --> 21:37.028
Understood.

21:38.202 --> 21:39.800
Can I ask you a question?

21:40.212 --> 21:41.803
Why are you doing this?

21:41.999 --> 21:43.457
I'm doing it for Bill.

21:44.626 --> 21:46.639
He and I have helped
each other for years.

21:47.121 --> 21:48.657
It can't just be that.

21:51.134 --> 21:53.302
I believe in the CIA.

21:53.732 --> 21:57.354
I would not have spent my entire
working life there if I didn't.

21:57.480 --> 22:01.564
This country needs it.
But I do not believe in corruption.

22:02.597 --> 22:05.917
The agency needs to be cleaned
up from time to time.

22:07.807 --> 22:09.010
So, what next?

22:09.120 --> 22:11.408
We'll meet again when I
have something for you.

22:12.497 --> 22:13.852
Okay. Thank you.

22:14.434 --> 22:17.958
Bill and I shouldn't be seen
together, so next time, uh...

22:19.044 --> 22:20.496
come alone.

22:28.050 --> 22:29.872
The phone itself is fine.

22:31.174 --> 22:34.045
The diagnostics
on the software--

22:35.647 --> 22:37.010
Let's see--

22:39.592 --> 22:40.776
Clean.

22:42.083 --> 22:43.880
The tap is definitely
still on and running.

22:45.463 --> 22:46.714
What's your concern?

22:46.811 --> 22:48.120
No one's using the line.

22:48.211 --> 22:50.602
Parsons hasn't talked
to anyone in days.

22:50.997 --> 22:52.324
You think she made you?

22:53.222 --> 22:54.714
Could be.

22:56.430 --> 23:00.999
Mmm, listen, uh, I need
to ask another favor.

23:01.345 --> 23:04.225
- Shoot.
- Just in case, can

23:04.312 --> 23:07.319
you keep an eye on things
at the agency for me?

23:07.726 --> 23:09.082
Anything in particular?

23:09.166 --> 23:12.357
See if anyone
pokes around my files.

23:13.001 --> 23:15.492
Someone leaked info on an
operation I was running

23:15.570 --> 23:17.895
a while back called
"Dust Devil."

23:18.179 --> 23:23.707
- You got it.
- Thanks.

23:25.560 --> 23:28.529
It was incredible.
It really was. Had a magical... uh...

23:29.401 --> 23:30.642
You know, we agreed to do
this in New York, Patty.

23:30.715 --> 23:32.237
You could at least be on time.

23:34.603 --> 23:37.026
Why is the stenographer
waiting in the hall?

23:37.123 --> 23:37.920
I asked her to.

23:38.027 --> 23:40.691
Mr., uh, Coupet would like
a moment before we begin.

23:41.615 --> 23:44.250
Ms. Hewes,
<i>s'il vous plaît.</i>

23:51.464 --> 23:54.225
<i>This legal action is
unpleasant for us all.</i>

23:54.890 --> 23:59.112
<i>Unpleasant?
People are dead...</i>

23:59.204 --> 24:01.806
<i>as a direct result of
your drug trials.</i>

24:01.906 --> 24:03.073
<i>That hasn't been proven.</i>

24:03.150 --> 24:05.379
<i>Forgive me, Ms. Hewes.</i>

24:07.587 --> 24:10.568
<i>We recognize this is a tragedy.</i>

24:11.192 --> 24:13.359
<i>We are prepared to
admit our mistakes.</i>

24:13.572 --> 24:15.968
<i>Yes, you will.
I'll make sure that you do.</i>

24:19.064 --> 24:22.491
<i>Ms. Hewes, the
medications that my company</i>

24:22.571 --> 24:26.772
<i>provides save millions of
lives around the world.</i>

24:27.784 --> 24:33.250
<i>But development of new cures has
been paralyzed by this litigation.</i>

24:33.353 --> 24:36.428
<i>You mean your profits
have been paralyzed.</i>

24:36.519 --> 24:39.264
<i>It is true.
The company is very large.</i>

24:39.346 --> 24:44.779
<i>Our business represents a
significant portion of my</i>

24:44.852 --> 24:48.042
<i>country's economy.
Much is at stake.</i>

24:48.308 --> 24:53.643
<i>It is essential to my government
that we put this case behind us.</i>

24:53.916 --> 24:56.525
<i>So Mr. Coupet has been
empowered by his board of</i>

24:56.609 --> 25:01.237
<i>directors and the French Ministry of Health
to offer your clients a settlement.</i>

25:02.575 --> 25:07.088
<i>We propose the amount
of 343 million euros.</i>

25:10.084 --> 25:14.853
<i>That's half a billion dollars,
Patty. It's more than generous.</i>

25:15.396 --> 25:19.853
<i>Alors...
you are amenable to this, Ms. Hewes?</i>

25:24.311 --> 25:26.516
<i>I have only two
days to depose you.</i>

25:26.756 --> 25:30.109
<i>Get the stenographer.
You've already wasted ten minutes.</i>

25:36.819 --> 25:40.326
<i>You here on the same assignment
that brought you here before?</i>

25:40.561 --> 25:44.264
<i>No, this is a vacation.
My agency gave me time off.</i>

25:44.781 --> 25:46.422
<i>And you came to see me?</i>

25:46.860 --> 25:49.372
<i>No, I was bored of Paris.</i>

25:59.685 --> 26:02.901
<i>When we were
together last... you asked</i>

26:03.010 --> 26:06.610
<i>why I never, never settled down.</i>

26:07.101 --> 26:08.813
<i>And now you have an answer?</i>

26:10.904 --> 26:14.239
<i>Don't think I
was ever really ready.</i>

26:21.727 --> 26:25.061
<i>You ever think about
being a mother?</i>

26:27.103 --> 26:29.956
<i>Not with a man who has
so many secrets.</i>

26:31.134 --> 26:34.454
<i>Play your cards right, you
just may learn a couple of them.</i>

26:35.124 --> 26:37.047
<i>I have secrets, too.</i>

26:38.112 --> 26:40.724
<i>I'm sure they're a lot
more interesting than mine.</i>

26:41.203 --> 26:44.006
<i>I could learn yours if
I really wanted to.</i>

26:45.280 --> 26:52.090
<i>We have our own techniques...
and I'm not afraid to use them.</i>

26:55.885 --> 26:57.232
<i>You promise?</i>

26:59.936 --> 27:02.458
<i>Are you warm
enough, honey, huh?</i>

27:03.422 --> 27:09.577
<i>We can't have you catching cold.
There we go.</i>

27:10.412 --> 27:11.948
<i>Hello there.</i>

27:14.655 --> 27:15.936
<i>Hi.</i>

27:16.279 --> 27:19.668
<i>She's beautiful.
I have a little girl, too.</i>

27:19.875 --> 27:21.074
<i>Oh, yes?</i>

27:21.157 --> 27:23.868
<i>I like your shoes.
They're very bright.</i>

27:26.161 --> 27:29.181
<i>- What do you say?
- Thank you.</i>

27:29.275 --> 27:30.474
<i>You're welcome.</i>

27:30.568 --> 27:34.180
<i>You know, I have one of my
daughter's friends with me.</i>

27:34.282 --> 27:35.601
<i>Can he say hello?</i>

27:38.700 --> 27:41.665
<i>- Hello there.
- Hello.</i>

27:41.769 --> 27:44.175
<i>- How are you today?
- Good.</i>

27:46.565 --> 27:48.197
<i>I think he likes you.</i>

27:48.282 --> 27:52.126
<i>Yeah. All right, Catherine,
let's... Let's give it back.</i>

27:52.763 --> 27:55.392
<i>That's all right.
She can keep it.</i>

27:55.491 --> 27:58.076
<i>Thank you, but we,
we can't accept this.</i>

27:58.538 --> 28:00.147
<i>Really, it's all right.</i>

28:04.511 --> 28:06.904
<i>It was nice to meet
you, Catherine.</i>

28:13.359 --> 28:15.054
<i>Can I have the panda, please?</i>

28:15.149 --> 28:18.515
<i>Oh, yes.
Well, here you go, there he is.</i>

29:13.413 --> 29:15.062
<i>I'm heading
over to Afghanistan.</i>

29:17.034 --> 29:19.025
<i>I'd like to get
your latest intel.</i>

29:19.120 --> 29:20.763
<i>I want to see what's happening
on the ground over there.</i>

29:20.882 --> 29:22.896
<i>Well, I'll see
what I can dig up.</i>

29:23.563 --> 29:26.684
<i>What's the sudden urge to
go back to the sandbox?</i>

29:26.804 --> 29:29.597
<i>I need to make an
appearance, check on my men.</i>

29:29.934 --> 29:34.136
<i>With all the new contracts coming in, I
want to make sure everything's tip-top.</i>

29:34.637 --> 29:36.218
<i>And I want to see Sanchez.</i>

29:36.473 --> 29:39.884
<i>Uh, see Sanchez?
What's the point?</i>

29:40.719 --> 29:42.741
<i>I want to
look him in the eye...</i>

29:44.223 --> 29:48.206
<i>one Marine to another...
make him understand.</i>

29:49.656 --> 29:52.101
<i>Well, I guess that's up to you,
but... I think you're</i>

29:52.179 --> 29:54.711
<i>just delaying the inevitable.</i>

29:55.047 --> 29:58.690
<i>He's one of my men.
I got to give the kid a chance.</i>

30:00.861 --> 30:03.960
<i>It'll be harder to
do once you see him again.</i>

30:04.769 --> 30:08.278
<i>Sanchez understands the chain
of command; he's just a little lost.</i>

30:08.465 --> 30:10.025
<i>I think I can bring him back.</i>

30:12.389 --> 30:14.629
<i>You're taking a
risk going over there.</i>

30:15.213 --> 30:19.059
<i>My best advice is to keep
your distance from him.</i>

30:19.195 --> 30:21.603
<i>I really don't need you
telling me how to run my men.</i>

30:22.414 --> 30:24.884
<i>You mean your</i>
<i>employees,</i> don't you?

30:28.336 --> 30:30.388
I'm heading
out early on tomorrow.

30:30.486 --> 30:32.289
I really would
appreciate that intel.

30:32.410 --> 30:34.378
All right, all right,
I'll make some calls.

30:34.464 --> 30:37.963
Why don't you ditch that thing and
we'll go in and have a drink?

30:38.686 --> 30:40.265
Outstanding.

30:44.026 --> 30:46.423
Mr. Coupet, is it
common practice for your

30:46.512 --> 30:49.115
vaccines to be tested in
third-world countries?

30:49.467 --> 30:52.343
All pharmaceuticals must
be tested in clinical trials.

30:52.542 --> 30:54.898
Please instruct your
client to answer the question.

30:54.988 --> 30:57.157
All right, you can answer.
Consider him instructed.

30:57.906 --> 31:01.097
Yes, we conduct trials
in third-world countries.

31:01.209 --> 31:03.381
Because impoverished,
uneducated people make more

31:03.468 --> 31:05.512
compliant subjects,
is that right?

31:05.735 --> 31:07.979
No.

31:08.303 --> 31:10.770
Because many
third-world governments will

31:10.841 --> 31:13.053
happily take a bribe
to look the other way?

31:13.140 --> 31:14.161
No.

31:14.273 --> 31:17.238
Mr. Coupet, were you
aware that the man you hired to

31:17.312 --> 31:22.119
conduct trials on the vaccine, Tranzec,
failed out of veterinary school?

31:22.203 --> 31:27.583
Two decades ago.
He's now a very well-respected researcher.

31:27.891 --> 31:30.938
Mr. Coupet, are you a
member of the extreme-right

31:31.035 --> 31:34.898
French ultra-nationalist political
party, <i>le Front National?</i>

31:35.594 --> 31:37.843
<i>I was, briefly.
Not anymore.</i>

31:37.931 --> 31:39.384
<i>What the hell does
my client's political</i>

31:39.463 --> 31:41.483
<i>affiliation have to
do with this case?</i>

31:41.762 --> 31:46.867
<i>Tranzec was tested using poor,
illiterate children as guinea pigs.</i>

31:46.951 --> 31:49.572
<i>And the research was conducted
by a person who wasn't even</i>

31:49.653 --> 31:55.840
<i>qualified to care for animals.
Now, does that kind of callous,</i>

31:56.005 --> 32:00.614
<i>unethical experimentation
remind you of... anything?</i>

32:01.457 --> 32:04.794
<i>Do not compare me to the Nazis.</i>

32:05.608 --> 32:08.838
<i>You</i> did...
Mr. Coupet, not me.

32:10.954 --> 32:13.064
You know, I speak a little
French, Mr. Coupet.

32:13.424 --> 32:15.232
And just because that little
outburst wasn't in English

32:15.313 --> 32:17.269
doesn't mean it's not
gonna be on the record.

32:17.378 --> 32:19.050
Well, what did he say?

32:19.417 --> 32:21.260
Tell me what you...
what-what did you say?

32:21.363 --> 32:24.367
He called me a
manipulative bitch. You get that?

32:24.533 --> 32:26.975
Please...
may we go off the record?

32:27.058 --> 32:28.395
Certainly.

32:29.505 --> 32:33.578
We will increase the
settlement offer to $650 million.

32:36.887 --> 32:39.445
Absolutely not.

32:39.934 --> 32:43.044
- Daddy's home, boys!
- Hey, welcome back, sir.

32:43.124 --> 32:44.614
Damn good
to be back, A.C.

32:44.707 --> 32:46.368
Feels good breathing
in that dust again.

32:46.458 --> 32:48.116
- You know, uh, Barkowski.
- Sure I do.

32:48.177 --> 32:49.559
- Good to see you again.
- You, too, sir.

32:50.079 --> 32:51.004
So, how was your trip?

32:51.104 --> 32:53.364
Oh, the road in was
a little hairy, as usual.

32:53.504 --> 32:55.401
Aside from that, I got
nothing to complain about.

32:55.511 --> 32:58.001
The guys are gonna be happy
to see you-- It's good for morale.

32:58.806 --> 33:01.301
Barkowski, would you
mind stepping out for a second?

33:01.388 --> 33:02.399
Of course, sir.

33:07.444 --> 33:08.908
How's Sanchez?

33:09.127 --> 33:10.561
Not good, sir.

33:13.266 --> 33:15.096
I want to talk to him.

33:16.832 --> 33:18.114
<i>I'm home!</i>

33:21.893 --> 33:23.121
How is everyone?

33:23.761 --> 33:24.640
Good.

33:24.744 --> 33:26.255
Wonderful.

33:26.430 --> 33:28.817
We had a play date with
the boy downstairs today.

33:28.895 --> 33:30.261
They got along very well.

33:30.769 --> 33:32.089
Well, that's good to hear.

33:38.015 --> 33:39.459
Where did she get that?

33:39.858 --> 33:43.155
We were out on a walk,
and a nice man gave it to her.

33:43.610 --> 33:45.212
She's crazy about it.

33:47.285 --> 33:50.270
- A nice man.
- Mm-hmm.

33:50.376 --> 33:53.561
He had a kind face.
Said he had a daughter of his own.

33:57.273 --> 34:00.181
I'm surprised you'd
take a toy from a stranger.

34:02.022 --> 34:03.931
I don't want it in the house.

34:27.239 --> 34:29.219
Hey, hey. Come on.

34:29.641 --> 34:31.741
Yo, hey, come on. Let's get up!

34:32.400 --> 34:35.572
Let's get out of here! Hey!

34:39.150 --> 34:41.766
Come on, this is not your
goddamn living room.

34:41.859 --> 34:44.245
Jesus Christ, this fucking city!

34:44.900 --> 34:47.040
Hey, schmuck, want me
to call the cops again?

34:47.362 --> 34:48.472
I'm talk...

34:52.746 --> 34:54.661
Julius...

34:58.999 --> 35:02.707
- Yeah.
- Your problem's been solved.

35:20.148 --> 35:24.364
- What's wrong?
- He's not coming.

35:25.275 --> 35:27.530
I'm in the middle of
the deposition. What's going on?

35:27.747 --> 35:30.130
- He's dead.
- Who?

35:30.232 --> 35:32.041
Bill's contact.

35:32.116 --> 35:34.336
I was supposed to meet him,
and he never showed.

35:35.030 --> 35:37.850
Bill found him.
The CIA guy.

35:37.956 --> 35:39.295
He knows we're on to him.

35:39.670 --> 35:41.495
Hey!
We're on a schedule here.

35:41.566 --> 35:42.807
One minute.

35:42.900 --> 35:44.385
This is
un-fuckin'-believable.

35:44.461 --> 35:46.562
- Are you alone?
- No, I'm with Bill.

35:47.298 --> 35:51.268
Good. Go back to the office and
stay there until you hear from me.

35:51.341 --> 35:53.776
And call Huntley.
Tell him to bring security.

35:54.149 --> 35:57.262
Okay. I'm so sorry.

36:01.702 --> 36:04.020
Patty, you're not
getting this time back.

36:04.601 --> 36:06.058
I don't need it.

36:07.119 --> 36:10.149
I'd like to talk to your
client again, off the record.

36:12.238 --> 36:15.512
I believe your last
offer was $650 million?

36:16.792 --> 36:19.734
- Yes.
- I'll accept a billion.

36:19.824 --> 36:22.123
Oh, Jesus, Patty, come on.

36:22.410 --> 36:25.642
As long as you
can get me what I need.

36:26.811 --> 36:29.051
And what is it you need?

36:29.551 --> 36:32.878
You say resolving this case
is important to your government.

36:33.877 --> 36:38.178
<i>- Oui.
- How important?</i>

37:15.340 --> 37:17.619
<i>You were
there; you saw it.</i>

37:39.943 --> 37:41.811
Jesus Christ.

37:41.995 --> 37:43.766
<i>I brought some
things from the States.</i>

37:45.851 --> 37:51.323
<i>Some beer. Peanuts.</i>

37:53.075 --> 37:55.522
<i>I thought maybe you could
use some things from home.</i>

38:18.395 --> 38:20.525
<i>Everything that's
happened to you...</i>

38:23.754 --> 38:27.229
<i>I've had my reasons, and
they were good reasons.</i>

38:29.271 --> 38:31.690
<i>I hope someday you'll
be able to see that.</i>

38:38.227 --> 38:40.155
<i>Lowry...</i>

38:40.548 --> 38:42.214
<i>and, uh...</i>

38:42.696 --> 38:44.102
<i>the other men...</i>

38:46.225 --> 38:50.552
<i>Franks. Rayburn.</i>

38:50.672 --> 38:53.757
<i>Yes.
They're gone, Chris.</i>

38:55.043 --> 38:55.995
<i>They're not coming back.</i>

38:56.082 --> 38:58.916
<i>I can't bring 'em back, you
can't bring 'em back.</i>

39:01.954 --> 39:06.088
<i>They went in there.
They knew it was dangerous.</i>

39:06.281 --> 39:07.707
<i>No one forced them.</i>

39:08.123 --> 39:09.543
<i>They needed the money.</i>

39:11.876 --> 39:13.217
<i>We all did.</i>

39:16.329 --> 39:18.884
<i>You see, that's why we
worked for you, because...</i>

39:20.274 --> 39:27.101
<i>you paid more than anyone else.
That's it.</i>

39:34.637 --> 39:39.965
<i>My options with you...
are very limited, Chris.</i>

39:42.259 --> 39:45.790
<i>Now, the question that you and I
have to answer together is...</i>

39:47.851 --> 39:49.469
<i>what next?</i>

39:56.304 --> 40:00.561
<i>You have a chance to save yourself...
but you need to</i>

40:00.646 --> 40:05.075
<i>summon your loyalty, you need to
soldier up and maintain your</i>

40:05.161 --> 40:10.957
<i>silence, you need to take what happened on
that last mission to your grave with you.</i>

40:11.995 --> 40:15.742
<i>That's the code.
I need you to honor that code.</i>

40:16.628 --> 40:18.199
<i>Fuck your code.</i>

40:18.313 --> 40:19.671
<i>Now, you listen to me, son...</i>

40:19.752 --> 40:22.837
<i>Or what?
What are you gonna do?</i>

40:23.140 --> 40:24.174
<i>You gonna kill me?</i>

40:24.340 --> 40:26.358
<i>Go ahead, give me a fuckin' gun.
Give me a fuckin' gun, I'll blow</i>

40:26.430 --> 40:28.505
<i>my fuckin' brains out
right now for you.</i>

40:28.929 --> 40:30.330
<i>Go on, do it.</i>

40:31.334 --> 40:33.770
<i>You tortured me because
I told the truth?</i>

40:33.852 --> 40:34.816
<i>Whose truth?</i>

40:34.914 --> 40:38.547
<i>Because the truth that I see is
there's people out there trying</i>

40:38.621 --> 40:42.256
<i>to kill us and we had the
balls to go get them!</i>

40:43.844 --> 40:44.840
<i>It was illegal.</i>

40:44.931 --> 40:47.610
<i>The law is not
the fucking truth!</i>

40:53.105 --> 40:54.219
<i>Now...</i>

40:56.184 --> 40:59.180
<i>I'm giving you a chance
to save yourself.</i>

41:00.150 --> 41:01.373
<i>I was looking after you.</i>

41:01.474 --> 41:03.547
<i>I tried to protect you.
I defended you.</i>

41:03.713 --> 41:06.057
<i>That's what you did?
You tried to help me?</i>

41:06.193 --> 41:07.639
<i>- Yeah.
- Yeah?</i>

41:07.724 --> 41:11.037
<i>Yeah. I told Boorman
that you were a standup guy.</i>

41:11.699 --> 41:16.628
<i>But what do you do? You betray me!
You talk to lawyers.</i>

41:16.708 --> 41:19.983
<i>You send Nasim Marwat to fuck me!</i>

41:20.994 --> 41:24.700
Everything that happened to you,
<i>you did to yourself.</i>

41:26.579 --> 41:28.490
<i>Fuck you.</i>

41:29.572 --> 41:32.982
<i>You fucked yourself!
Fuck you, you cocksucker!</i>

41:33.197 --> 41:36.780
<i>Fuck you!</i>

41:51.238 --> 41:54.222
<i>Go ahead and laugh.</i>

41:55.030 --> 41:58.250
<i>Because it's the last fucking
thing you will ever do.</i>

42:08.407 --> 42:11.018
<i>This agreement requires
your client's company</i>

42:11.900 --> 42:13.948
<i>to change their
testing practices.</i>

42:14.767 --> 42:16.862
<i>If they don't comply, I'm
coming after them again.</i>

42:17.504 --> 42:19.742
<i>Come on, Patty.
You won. Relax.</i>

42:24.510 --> 42:26.421
<i>You have something for me.</i>

42:27.237 --> 42:32.592
<i>Yeah. It's courtesy of
the French Secret Services.</i>

42:43.733 --> 42:44.924
<i>Leave a message.</i>

42:45.572 --> 42:48.717
<i>I know I shouldn't call,
but I need to see you.</i>

42:50.776 --> 42:53.322
<i>My government is betraying you.</i>

43:05.987 --> 43:08.263
<i>His name is Gerald Boorman.</i>

43:09.481 --> 43:11.736
<i>And the French
government gave you his file?</i>

43:12.243 --> 43:14.263
<i>Yeah, they were very
invested in the Tranzec case</i>

43:14.343 --> 43:16.360
<i>going away, so I made a deal.</i>

43:16.761 --> 43:19.085
<i>You settled your
case to help me with mine?</i>

43:20.769 --> 43:22.803
<i>It was a very
healthy settlement.</i>

43:28.071 --> 43:30.410
<i>Is there any useful
information in here?</i>

43:30.585 --> 43:33.023
<i>I found something
very interesting.</i>

43:33.153 --> 43:35.882
<i>The French Secret Service
stopped getting intelligence</i>

43:35.964 --> 43:40.550
<i>briefings from Boorman
in early 2010.</i>

43:41.261 --> 43:43.416
<i>And Chris' last
mission was October.</i>

43:46.253 --> 43:48.574
<i>I think it's time
we made a call.</i>

44:16.661 --> 44:19.134
<i>- Patty, it's Ellen.
- I'm glad you called.</i>

44:19.658 --> 44:21.996
<i>- Why is that?
- I was just about to</i>

44:22.108 --> 44:23.917
<i>have a word with Mr. Boorman.</i>

44:25.470 --> 44:28.465
<i>Hello, Mr. Boorman.
This is Patty Hewes.</i>

44:31.674 --> 44:35.505
<i>There's no need to respond.
I know you're listening.</i>

44:35.801 --> 44:42.012
<i>So please don't hang up.
I think we can be useful to each other.</i>

45:11.560 --> 45:13.678
<i>I've learned a lot about you.</i>

45:14.382 --> 45:15.803
<i>Is that so?</i>

45:16.654 --> 45:18.221
<i>Let's start with the
fact that you used to run an</i>

45:18.305 --> 45:23.577
<i>illegal extraction program
called Operation Dust Devil.</i>

45:26.285 --> 45:29.342
<i>With the help of High Star
employees, your agency was able</i>

45:29.439 --> 45:33.024
<i>to provide the international
community with intelligence</i>

45:33.137 --> 45:38.410
<i>about supposed terrorist
activities in Afghanistan.</i>

45:39.691 --> 45:43.369
<i>The problem is, the French
government learned that much of</i>

45:43.453 --> 45:48.855
<i>your intelligence was faulty, and
that some of the targets you</i>

45:48.944 --> 45:52.006
<i>tortured were innocent.</i>

45:52.873 --> 45:55.575
<i>Well, hell, they're the French.</i>

45:57.708 --> 46:01.852
<i>So, because of
international pressure, the CIA</i>

46:01.945 --> 46:07.403
<i>stopped Operation Dust Devil, which
was, what, beginning of 2010.</i>

46:08.681 --> 46:13.188
<i>But three employees of High
Star were killed in October...</i>

46:14.488 --> 46:16.734
<i>which means that you and Howard
Erickson sent those men on a</i>

46:16.810 --> 46:20.265
<i>mission that was not</i>
sanctioned by the CIA.

46:22.747 --> 46:25.976
What did you and Howard Erickson
get out of that mission?

46:27.501 --> 46:29.248
Who was the target?

46:29.774 --> 46:33.024
Much as I'd love to
chat about Dust Devil,

46:33.997 --> 46:38.428
I'm afraid it's classified,
and I'm just not at liberty.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.123
You helped Erickson
cover up the deaths of three

46:41.203 --> 46:48.491
High Star employees, so I'm
thinking you've got a lot to lose.

46:49.977 --> 46:52.376
We don't want you.
We're not idiots.

46:52.475 --> 46:54.817
We know we can't
bring down the CIA.

46:55.341 --> 46:57.925
Oh, well, who do you want?

46:59.057 --> 47:01.010
Howard Erickson.

47:02.568 --> 47:06.444
Proof that those men died
illegally, so we can hold High

47:06.526 --> 47:11.338
Star accountable, get
restitution for their families.

47:13.027 --> 47:14.618
Ms. Hewes...

47:16.338 --> 47:18.779
you're wrestling
with the wrong gator.

47:19.501 --> 47:22.753
Give us Howard Erickson,
and we'll leave you alone.

47:22.845 --> 47:24.674
I-I don't make deals.

47:25.878 --> 47:29.754
Mainly 'cause, uh,
I don't have to.

47:30.925 --> 47:33.179
I know you had
our contact killed.

47:33.556 --> 47:37.397
And if anything happens to me or
Miss Parsons, I've arranged for

47:37.491 --> 47:41.072
everything we have
on you to go public.

47:45.385 --> 47:47.469
Have a nice day, Mr. Boorman.

47:57.789 --> 48:00.156
- How'd it go?
- As we suspected.

48:00.623 --> 48:03.859
He didn't show his hand, and
I could tell he was nervous.

48:04.331 --> 48:05.748
What do we do next?

48:05.923 --> 48:08.337
Wait for him to
turn against Erickson.

48:21.147 --> 48:25.691
I was wrong.
The lawsuit against High Star?

48:26.356 --> 48:29.724
You asked me if it had anything
to do with Dust Devil.

48:30.294 --> 48:34.703
- Does it?
- Yes.

48:35.772 --> 48:40.358
Erickson lied.
He went rogue on me.

48:41.992 --> 48:46.543
After the agency called off the operation,
he pulled another mission anyway.

48:47.612 --> 48:49.305
So what's it got to do with us?

48:50.624 --> 48:54.679
He used the Dust Devil
unit, and three of 'em got killed.

48:54.900 --> 48:57.092
Oh, Jesus. Fuck.

48:58.207 --> 49:01.498
High Star's got
to take the fall for this.

49:05.466 --> 49:09.221
It's time we cut ties
with Howard Erickson.

49:34.682 --> 49:36.246
Hello?

49:38.804 --> 49:40.468
Jerry?

50:05.545 --> 50:07.162
Hello?

50:09.107 --> 50:10.698
Jerry?

50:28.930 --> 50:30.481
You talk to Sanchez?

50:30.659 --> 50:35.647
Yes, I did, and
I offered him a lifeline.

50:35.927 --> 50:37.137
And?

50:39.724 --> 50:42.139
The son of a
bitch did not take it.

50:46.064 --> 50:47.801
I'm sorry to hear that.

50:49.786 --> 50:54.624
He forced my hand.
He's got to go.

50:59.049 --> 51:06.007
Howard...
you and I-- We go way back.

51:06.597 --> 51:11.810
If that's your decision,
I'm behind you 100%.

51:14.007 --> 51:15.652
Thank you, Jerry.

51:20.818 --> 51:23.705
It's good to know I got you
in the trenches with me.

51:33.406 --> 51:34.739
Hello?
