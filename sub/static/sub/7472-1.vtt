WEBVTT

03:54.484 --> 03:56.526
Hey. this area's restricted.

03:56.527 --> 04:00.906
Hi. Yeah. I know. They called me down here.
Some of this wiring got screwed up.

04:00.907 --> 04:04.493
Nobody called it down to me.
I'm gonna have to see a work order.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.370
Yeah. Just a second.

04:09.707 --> 04:11.708
There you are.

04:13.419 --> 04:15.754
Nothing personal.

04:19.007 --> 04:22.552
Well. I guess that wraps it up.
Good work. everybody.

04:23.638 --> 04:27.641
Marty. I couldn't be happier
with the way this worked out.

04:30.436 --> 04:32.521
Congratulations.

04:36.734 --> 04:38.277
Hold that.

04:40.363 --> 04:42.447
Gee. thanks.

04:50.581 --> 04:55.002
Thanks for pushing that. Bob. The light's on.
but you never know. it might be broken.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.795
Shut up.

05:11.769 --> 05:13.854
Remember. honey...

05:52.977 --> 05:56.271
Jesus. Bob. what button did you push?

06:42.777 --> 06:47.406
Mr Bagwell. make sure these other elevators
remain locked down and empty.

06:47.407 --> 06:52.327
There's no doors. no other way in or out.
except through access panels. correct?

06:52.328 --> 06:57.541
What we have here are 13 passengers
in an express elevator below floor 30.

06:58.918 --> 07:03.046
Bomb's taken out cables. Bomber wants
$3 million or he blows the brakes.

07:03.047 --> 07:05.757
- What's our clock?
- He gave one hour.

07:06.968 --> 07:09.428
That leaves us 23 minutes exactly.

07:09.429 --> 07:12.848
- Anything to keep this elevator from falling?
- The basement.

07:12.849 --> 07:14.933
We'd like to avoid that. Traven.

07:14.934 --> 07:18.395
- We can't unload the passengers?
- This is an express elevator.

07:18.396 --> 07:22.441
The only way in is through access panels.
The bomber's wired the hatch.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.735
which seats him
in the "crazy but not stupid" section.

07:25.736 --> 07:29.197
Sir. Harry volunteers to examine the device.

07:29.198 --> 07:33.118
- Yeah. right.
- Fine. The two of you check it out.

07:33.119 --> 07:36.246
The nearest access panel's
on the 32nd floor in the lobby.

07:36.247 --> 07:41.042
I want reports only. We're in a holding
pattern. Worthy. Briggs. secure the base area.

07:41.043 --> 07:44.171
Everyone else.
I want you to affirm building evac. Move!

07:45.214 --> 07:47.174
Looks like we're walkin'.

07:48.426 --> 07:50.594
- Hurry. but watch your step!
- 29.

07:50.595 --> 07:54.264
All the way down to the lobby! Let's go. folks!

07:54.265 --> 07:55.724
30.

07:57.935 --> 07:59.019
31.

08:01.439 --> 08:02.689
32.

08:24.921 --> 08:25.795
Hello?

08:26.464 --> 08:30.842
- Come on! Get us outta here!
- Hello! Hello!

09:03.918 --> 09:07.045
Help! Please. get us out of here!

09:08.297 --> 09:09.464
Please!

09:32.863 --> 09:35.740
Please! Get us out of here!

09:38.077 --> 09:43.039
Who's up there?
Who's up there? What's going on?

09:43.040 --> 09:45.458
Ladies and gentlemen. this is the LAPD.

09:45.459 --> 09:47.919
- Thank God.
- What are you doing up there?

09:47.920 --> 09:52.299
There's been an elevator malfunction.
so just relax.

09:53.217 --> 09:55.969
Hey. come on!
What are you guys waiting for?

09:55.970 --> 09:59.889
We'll have you out of there
as soon as possible.

09:59.890 --> 10:02.058
Am I lying?

10:02.059 --> 10:07.522
How come they sent cops here?
Shouldn't they send repair guys?

10:14.864 --> 10:17.365
What do you think?

10:18.367 --> 10:22.704
- You're the expert. I just work here.
- Looks pretty solid.

10:22.705 --> 10:26.541
- Anyone we know?
- I don't recognise the work. but he's a pro.

10:27.877 --> 10:31.046
- He's cutting it close.
- I don't like it.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.923
Well. what's to like?
Mac said we hold. so we hold.

10:43.934 --> 10:47.896
All right. pop quiz.
The airport. Gunman with one hostage.

10:47.897 --> 10:51.191
He's using her for cover.
He's almost to a plane.

10:51.192 --> 10:53.860
You're 100 feet away.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.201
Jack.

11:02.203 --> 11:04.829
Shoot the hostage.

11:04.830 --> 11:07.749
- What?
- Take her out of the equation.

11:07.750 --> 11:11.961
Go for the good wound and he can't
get to the plane with her. Clear shot.

11:11.962 --> 11:15.715
You're deeply nuts. you know that?
"Shoot the hostage."

11:19.887 --> 11:23.223
Harry. this is wrong.
He's gonna blow it anyway.

11:24.350 --> 11:28.186
- Why?
- I don't know. Gut feeling.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.897
Right now Mac outranks your gut. so we sit.

11:31.899 --> 11:35.443
This is taking way too long.

11:35.444 --> 11:37.862
How much d'you think that elevator weighs?

11:37.863 --> 11:39.948
Jack. come on.

11:41.951 --> 11:45.954
Maybe we can do something
about those hostages.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.456
We're not gonna shoot 'em. right?

11:49.750 --> 11:52.877
Hey. where you going? What's going on?

11:54.463 --> 11:58.299
Don't go! Don't leave us here!

12:13.107 --> 12:15.984
No. we just take them out of the equation.

12:48.726 --> 12:51.936
- Are you sure it'll hold?
- It'll hold.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.356
Six minutes.

12:55.357 --> 12:58.818
I can't get any more time. He's not talking!

12:58.819 --> 13:01.070
I need the goddamn money now.

13:11.248 --> 13:14.667
Tell me again. Harry. Why did I take this job?

13:14.668 --> 13:18.963
Oh. come on. 30 more years of this. you get
a tiny pension and a cheap gold watch.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.673
Cool.

13:53.123 --> 13:56.251
- God. it's hot in here.
- There's no air.

13:56.252 --> 13:59.254
- Can't they just pry the doors open?
- I can't breathe.

14:04.552 --> 14:07.053
Don't fuck with Daddy.

14:40.796 --> 14:43.214
Usually they fall down now.

14:52.141 --> 14:55.059
He's early. The son of a bitch is early!

15:14.330 --> 15:17.457
Mac. we need more help up here now!

15:17.458 --> 15:21.044
Oh. please! I don't wanna die!

15:21.045 --> 15:22.295
Please save us!

15:28.677 --> 15:31.763
Open the door! Open the door. please!

15:35.017 --> 15:39.687
- Please help me!
- We'll get you out!

15:39.688 --> 15:44.108
- Give me your hands! It's OK.
- Pull me through.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.953
Watch your head. Watch your head.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.956
- OK. I've got you.
- Take it easy.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.792
- You're fine. You're fine.
- Thank you.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.627
- Take her.
- Who's next?

16:05.881 --> 16:06.965
Thank you.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.718
We've got you. ma'am.

16:16.350 --> 16:19.644
- What the hell is all this?
- Help us! Hurry!

16:22.815 --> 16:26.150
Hurry. hurry! Let's go! Go! Go!

16:26.151 --> 16:27.610
Come on. Come on.

16:32.491 --> 16:35.201
Oh. my God! Oh. my God!

16:35.202 --> 16:38.538
- Help me out! Please. help me out.
- Watch your head.

16:39.665 --> 16:41.374
- Come on. lady!
- No.

16:41.375 --> 16:44.085
Come on. lady! Come on! Grab my hand!

16:49.633 --> 16:52.969
- Come on! Let's go! It's going to fall!
- No!

16:52.970 --> 16:54.303
No. I can't!

16:54.304 --> 16:57.807
Just take one step. reach out
and take my hand.

16:57.808 --> 17:00.601
Come on! Come on!

17:03.731 --> 17:07.858
- Oh. God! Don't let go of me!
- You're OK.

17:24.167 --> 17:26.294
My shoe!

17:28.130 --> 17:29.797
Was it good for you?

17:29.798 --> 17:32.884
It was great for me.
How was it for you. honey?

17:32.885 --> 17:36.012
- Elevator dropped.
- Good. That's good to know.

17:42.311 --> 17:45.104
- Is your watch slow?
- No. He jumped the gun.

17:45.105 --> 17:48.691
- We had three minutes left.
- Why does he do that?

17:48.692 --> 17:50.610
He's losing his $3 million.

17:50.611 --> 17:53.529
Maybe he couldn't hold his wad long enough.

17:53.530 --> 17:57.909
It's a common problem among
middle-aged men. So I'm told.

18:03.665 --> 18:08.044
- He's here.
- He could've blown that thing from Pacoima.

18:08.045 --> 18:13.216
No. He knew we were up to something.
He's close by.

18:13.217 --> 18:18.429
He's not gonna corner himself in a building
we evacuated anyway. Come on.

18:23.727 --> 18:28.731
He'd wanna be here.
but he'd wanna stay mobile. right?

18:32.361 --> 18:34.237
The elevators.

18:34.238 --> 18:37.657
Passenger cars were stopped.
They checked 'em out.

18:37.658 --> 18:40.118
What about the freight elevators?

19:04.017 --> 19:07.603
- Will the mystery guest please sign in?
- What?

19:09.773 --> 19:11.732
Jack!

19:11.733 --> 19:13.818
Damn it.

19:54.526 --> 19:56.235
Get to the side!

20:12.544 --> 20:14.587
Shit! Shit! Shit!

20:16.840 --> 20:19.050
Up! Get your ass up!

21:02.386 --> 21:07.265
I don't suppose anybody'll give me
three million just for you.

21:12.437 --> 21:14.063
Hold it!

21:15.732 --> 21:20.319
Pop quiz. hotshot.
Terrorist holding a police hostage.

21:20.320 --> 21:25.741
Got enough dynamite strapped to his chest to
blow a building in half. Now what do you do?

21:25.742 --> 21:28.911
There's gonna be 50 cops
waiting for you in the basement.

21:28.912 --> 21:31.205
Standard flanking deployment. right?

21:31.206 --> 21:38.421
Maybe we'll get off on the third floor. huh?
At least that's what they'll think.

21:38.422 --> 21:42.633
I want location on those goddamn shots!
Briggs! Where's Jack and Harry?

21:42.634 --> 21:46.137
Lieutenant. we've got movement
on the freight elevator.

21:53.270 --> 21:55.062
It's on three. Let's move!

21:57.941 --> 22:02.903
End of the line. This day has been
real disappointing. I don't mind saying.

22:02.904 --> 22:04.822
Because you didn't kill everyone?

22:04.823 --> 22:08.826
There will come a time. boy.
when you'll wish you'd never met me.

22:08.827 --> 22:10.953
Mister. I'm already there.

22:10.954 --> 22:17.918
I'm in charge here. I drop this stick
and they pick your friend up with a sponge.

22:17.919 --> 22:21.964
- Are you ready to die. friend?
- Fuck you.

22:21.965 --> 22:26.427
In 200 years. we've come from "I regret
but I have one life to give for my country"

22:26.428 --> 22:27.678
to "fuck you"?

22:27.679 --> 22:30.931
- Go ahead. Drop the stick. Do it.
- Shut up. Harry.

22:30.932 --> 22:34.226
We've got all the balls
in the world right here. man.

22:34.227 --> 22:37.146
Give it up. You got nowhere to go!

22:37.147 --> 22:38.981
Shoot the hostage.

22:42.069 --> 22:43.402
Say goodbye. Harry.

22:48.784 --> 22:50.034
You fuck!

22:52.788 --> 22:57.041
Freeze!

22:57.042 --> 23:00.002
Give it up! You're out of options!

23:23.652 --> 23:28.447
Through dedication and bravery.
these next two officers effected the rescue

23:28.448 --> 23:31.534
of 13 citizens of this city.

23:31.535 --> 23:36.330
And. thanks to them. the only life taken
by the terrorist's bomb was his own.

23:36.331 --> 23:38.791
You shot me. I can't believe it.

23:38.792 --> 23:42.086
They're giving you a medal
for shooting me. you little prick.

23:42.087 --> 23:45.589
Harry. you told me to.

23:45.590 --> 23:48.092
..the Los Angeles Police Department.

23:49.928 --> 23:52.012
Officer Harry Temple.

24:07.112 --> 24:08.612
Officer Jack Traven.

24:26.089 --> 24:29.508
Way to go, Jack. Way to go.

24:29.509 --> 24:31.886
- There we go.
- Harry, my man.

24:31.887 --> 24:36.015
Beautiful. A toast to me.
Make me feel good about myself.

24:36.016 --> 24:38.851
Hey, Sandy! Here we go!

24:38.852 --> 24:41.103
OK, so how we doing? Whoa, whoa.

24:41.104 --> 24:44.106
Shit. I need a bib!

24:45.901 --> 24:50.070
- Here we go. All right.
- You can't take me anywhere.

24:50.071 --> 24:53.407
And here is to Harry,

24:53.408 --> 24:56.577
for his quick thinking,

24:56.578 --> 25:01.081
for his grace under pressure
and for his brave and selfless act.

25:01.082 --> 25:03.125
Hear! Hear!

25:04.586 --> 25:09.215
And to Jack, for shooting Harry.

25:09.216 --> 25:12.593
Something we've all wanted to do
for a very long time.

25:12.594 --> 25:15.262
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

25:15.263 --> 25:17.431
OK, no, no. Here it is.

25:17.432 --> 25:22.603
Here's to you guys for doing your job
and for not getting dead.

25:22.604 --> 25:24.939
Mazel tov.

25:34.199 --> 25:36.742
We are the two luckiest guys in the world.

25:36.743 --> 25:39.787
We got the bad guy
and we didn't lose any civilians.

25:39.788 --> 25:42.122
- We're good.
- No. You were lucky.

25:42.123 --> 25:46.001
No, we were lucky. You'd better understand it.

25:46.002 --> 25:48.754
We were dealing with a total psycho.

25:48.755 --> 25:51.882
This guy could've blown us up at any time.

25:52.759 --> 25:55.761
And I got a bullet in me.

25:55.762 --> 25:59.974
Six inches off the mark,
and they're giving the medal to my wife.

25:59.975 --> 26:03.477
Harry, come on, man.
I mean, we won. We got him.

26:03.478 --> 26:06.480
Do you listen? Do you ever?

26:06.481 --> 26:11.652
Because I am not gonna be around
to back you up, so you better start thinking.

26:12.904 --> 26:16.699
Guts'll get you so far,
and then they'll get you killed.

26:20.078 --> 26:23.080
Luck runs out sooner or later. Right, Chief?

26:23.081 --> 26:24.665
That's right.

26:27.419 --> 26:32.089
I'm all right. I'm all right.
I'm gonna go home, have some sex.

26:34.593 --> 26:40.055
- Harry, you're gonna go home and puke.
- Yeah, well, that'll be fun, too.

26:40.056 --> 26:42.391
Come on, you gimp.

27:04.581 --> 27:08.709
- Hey, Jack, saw you on TV. Congratulations.
- Thanks, Bob.

27:08.710 --> 27:11.170
- You looked fat.
- Take it easy on him, Bob.

27:11.171 --> 27:14.548
- The boy was up late last night partying.
- Wild party, huh?

27:14.549 --> 27:18.969
I don't remember that well.
Couldn't have been too great. Woke up alone.

27:18.970 --> 27:24.850
Yeah? The last time I partied like that,
I woke up married, huh, Vinnie?

27:24.851 --> 27:27.144
Hey, Jack, you forgot your muffins.

27:27.145 --> 27:30.481
- Have a good one, Bob.
- Thanks, Jack. Take care.

27:30.482 --> 27:32.107
Thanks.

27:44.037 --> 27:46.121
See you tomorrow.

28:05.141 --> 28:07.559
Call 911 !

29:02.907 --> 29:04.992
What do you think, Jack?

29:04.993 --> 29:10.038
You think if you pick up all the bus driver's
teeth, they'll give you another medal?

29:10.039 --> 29:11.123
Jesus!

29:11.124 --> 29:13.792
You think I wouldn't have been prepared?

29:13.793 --> 29:20.382
Two years I spent setting up that elevator job.
Two years I invested myself in it.

29:20.383 --> 29:23.594
You couldn't understand
the kind of commitment that I have.

29:23.595 --> 29:26.930
You ruined a man's life's work
and you think you can walk away?

29:26.931 --> 29:32.144
You got blinders on to the world,
but I got your attention now, didn't I, Jack?

29:32.145 --> 29:36.940
- Why didn't you just come after me?
- This is about me. This is about my money.

29:36.941 --> 29:40.944
This is about money due me,
which I will collect.

29:40.945 --> 29:43.655
$3.7 million.

29:43.656 --> 29:48.118
It's my nest egg, Jack.
At my age, you gotta think ahead.

29:48.119 --> 29:50.829
- When I find you...
- Pop quiz, hotshot.

29:50.830 --> 29:53.707
There's a bomb on a bus.

29:53.708 --> 29:58.003
Once the bus goes 50 miles an hour,
the bomb is armed.

29:58.004 --> 30:02.591
If it drops below 50, it blows up.

30:02.592 --> 30:05.427
What do you do? What do you do?

30:06.513 --> 30:11.308
- I'd wanna know what bus it was.
- You think I'm gonna teII you that?

30:11.309 --> 30:13.644
- Yes.
- Very good.

30:13.645 --> 30:17.147
There are rules, Jack,
and I want you to get this right.

30:17.148 --> 30:19.650
No one goes off the bus.

30:19.651 --> 30:23.779
You try to take any passengers off the bus,
I will detonate it.

30:23.780 --> 30:26.698
I want my money by 11am.

30:28.451 --> 30:32.120
- We can't pull that kind of money in time.
- Focus, Jack!

30:32.121 --> 30:37.835
Your concern is the bus.
And don't try to call. The radio's down.

30:37.836 --> 30:43.757
Now, the number of the bus is 2525.
It's running downtown from Venice.

30:43.758 --> 30:47.719
It is at the corner of Ocean Park and Main.

31:01.860 --> 31:05.487
Sam!

31:05.488 --> 31:06.989
Annie.

31:06.990 --> 31:08.949
Sam! Tell him to stop!

31:08.950 --> 31:12.077
Shit. Excuse me. Coming through! Sam!

31:14.664 --> 31:17.165
- Sam!
- This ain't no bus stop.

31:17.166 --> 31:19.459
- Come on.
- Get rid of your butt, Annie.

31:19.460 --> 31:22.170
OK, it's gone, it's gone.

31:22.171 --> 31:27.217
You are a good, kind man. One day
people are gonna write songs about you.

31:36.060 --> 31:38.103
- Hi.
- Hi.

31:46.738 --> 31:51.366
- First time in LA.
- Oh, no. I live here.

31:51.367 --> 31:54.578
No, I mean mine. Oh, that's just funny.

31:54.579 --> 31:57.623
- You heard me wrong. I'm sightseeing.
- Oh, really?

31:57.624 --> 32:02.294
Yeah. I hate to use the word "tourist",
but it's not like I can hide it.

32:02.295 --> 32:04.421
Not really.

32:06.925 --> 32:13.013
Aw, jeez. You know, it took me three hours
just to get here from the airport. I got so lost.

32:13.014 --> 32:17.351
LA is one large place. Course, you live here.
You probably don't notice.

32:17.352 --> 32:20.979
I'm such a yokel. There. I said it.

32:20.980 --> 32:24.358
You know what? I got gum on my seat.

32:24.359 --> 32:26.485
Gum.

32:28.279 --> 32:30.364
Excuse me.

32:31.699 --> 32:32.866
- Morning.
- Hi.

33:36.514 --> 33:39.266
I just couldn't handle the freeways any more.

33:39.267 --> 33:41.435
I got so tense.

33:41.436 --> 33:44.563
This way, I can just relax all the way to work.

33:44.564 --> 33:48.358
Yeah, well, I love my car. I miss my car.

34:01.122 --> 34:03.206
Oh, God. Look at that.

34:05.334 --> 34:07.210
- Hey, Sam!
- Shit.

34:07.211 --> 34:09.087
- Sam!
- What?

34:09.088 --> 34:13.884
- Why don't you just drive over these people?
- Don't spit on my bus, Annie.

34:14.927 --> 34:16.094
Such a mess.

34:32.487 --> 34:33.612
Stop!

34:39.284 --> 34:43.038
- Open up!
- Get off the door. This ain't no bus stop.

34:43.039 --> 34:46.208
- That guy really wants to get on the bus.
- Open up! Stop!

34:46.208 --> 34:49.002
- Don't, Sam! Don't let him on!
- LAPD!

34:49.003 --> 34:51.045
- I can't hear you!
- Stop this bus!

34:51.047 --> 34:53.047
What?

34:53.049 --> 34:56.092
LAPD! Stop the bus!

34:56.094 --> 34:58.553
LAPD!

35:01.557 --> 35:03.725
Stop! Stop!

35:05.144 --> 35:08.480
- Stop! LAPD! Get out of the car.
- Jesus, not again.

35:08.481 --> 35:12.484
This is my car. I own this car. It's not stolen.

35:12.485 --> 35:14.945
- It is now. Move over.
- Fuck!

35:14.946 --> 35:20.492
Man, you scratch this puppy, and me and you
are gonna have words, you understand?

35:38.719 --> 35:43.306
OK, look, man, we don't have to go so fast.
Just slow down a little bit.

35:44.308 --> 35:47.602
Oh, shit. Come on, man.

35:47.603 --> 35:50.647
Just don't tear up my car, all right?

35:51.774 --> 35:55.318
OK, OK. Just slow down just a bit, all right?

35:55.319 --> 35:59.114
We don't have to go so fast, do we?
We don't have to go so...

36:01.534 --> 36:04.369
That was a nice move, man.

36:16.257 --> 36:18.633
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

36:18.634 --> 36:21.803
The least you could do is slow down.
Come on.

36:21.804 --> 36:24.806
Oh, shit.

36:24.807 --> 36:26.474
Oh, shit!

36:28.394 --> 36:29.644
Move! Move!

36:32.481 --> 36:34.774
Is that that guy?

36:34.775 --> 36:37.235
Man sure has a hard-on for this bus.

36:52.543 --> 36:55.754
Hey! I'm a cop!

36:55.755 --> 36:57.797
What?

36:57.798 --> 36:59.299
I'm a cop!

36:59.300 --> 37:03.428
LAPD! There's a bomb on your bus!

37:04.305 --> 37:06.973
- What?
- There's a bomb on your bus!

37:06.974 --> 37:10.227
There's a... What? Fuck!

37:10.228 --> 37:14.356
- There's a bomb on your bus!
- Watch the road!

37:14.357 --> 37:16.775
Grab that. I want you to write on it.

37:16.776 --> 37:19.736
I want you to write on the back:
"Bomb on bus."

37:21.447 --> 37:23.031
Write it, write it, write it!

37:38.798 --> 37:40.507
Watch the road. Oh, shit.

37:53.688 --> 37:55.272
Oh, shit!

37:55.273 --> 37:56.773
No!

37:56.774 --> 37:58.942
Don't slow down!

38:03.281 --> 38:06.491
No! No, no, no, no, no!

38:06.492 --> 38:08.493
Speed up!

38:10.413 --> 38:12.622
Open your door!

38:12.623 --> 38:15.000
Open the doors!

38:17.795 --> 38:20.547
50! Stay above 50!

38:20.548 --> 38:22.799
All right?

38:26.595 --> 38:30.432
470 8000. Ask for Detective Harry Temple.

38:33.102 --> 38:35.103
Harry.

38:35.104 --> 38:37.147
Harry, it's Jack.

38:40.860 --> 38:43.945
You better not be calling in sick,
cos I dragged my ass...

38:43.946 --> 38:46.823
- Harry, he's alive.
- What?

38:46.824 --> 38:49.159
The bomber. He's back.

38:49.160 --> 38:52.495
He hit one in Venice already.
There's nothing left.

38:52.496 --> 38:56.082
We got a ransom demand from your
dead terrorist. Says he's rigged a bus.

38:56.083 --> 38:58.335
- Where's Jack?
- Where do you think?

38:58.336 --> 39:01.463
- I gotta get on that bus.
- You gotta get...

39:01.464 --> 39:03.631
Yeah, yeah. You get on the bus.

39:03.632 --> 39:06.051
Drive straight!

39:06.052 --> 39:08.970
Stay in this lane!

39:08.971 --> 39:10.055
Watch the road.

39:13.684 --> 39:16.394
Wait a minute. What are you doin'?

39:16.395 --> 39:18.730
- Are you insured?
- Yeah! Why?

39:19.899 --> 39:21.608
No! No!

39:25.112 --> 39:27.989
You broke my door.

39:27.990 --> 39:32.702
- Sir, I need to take your phone.
- Take the phone.

39:33.788 --> 39:36.623
- Take the wheel.
- What?

39:37.500 --> 39:39.918
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

39:45.674 --> 39:46.966
Drive straight.

39:52.973 --> 39:55.016
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

40:00.398 --> 40:01.231
Oh, shit!

40:04.735 --> 40:06.778
Shit!

40:20.418 --> 40:22.127
This guy's out of his mind.

40:23.921 --> 40:27.298
OK, listen, you gotta stay above 50.

40:27.299 --> 40:31.302
- Excuse me, are you out of your mind?
- Whatever it takes.

40:32.471 --> 40:35.598
Everybody, I'm Jack Traven, LAPD.

40:35.599 --> 40:38.935
We have a slight situation on the bus.
If you'll please sit down.

40:38.936 --> 40:42.897
- You're scaring the shit out of these people.
- Ma'am, please!

40:46.152 --> 40:50.530
If everybody will stay in your seats
and remain calm,

40:50.531 --> 40:53.366
we should be able to defuse the problem...

40:53.367 --> 40:55.743
Get away from me!

40:59.957 --> 41:03.960
I don't know you, man.
I'm not here for you. Let's not do this.

41:03.961 --> 41:05.712
- Stop the bus!
- He can't.

41:05.713 --> 41:08.923
Shut up! Stop the bus! Stop it!

41:08.924 --> 41:11.009
Listen!

41:12.178 --> 41:14.471
Look, I'm putting my gun away, OK?

41:17.016 --> 41:18.892
OK?

41:20.769 --> 41:25.523
Now, listen. I don't care about your crime.

41:25.524 --> 41:31.946
Whatever you did, I'm sure that you're sorry,
so it's cool now. It's over.

41:36.952 --> 41:39.454
And I'm not a cop right now.

41:41.123 --> 41:45.335
See? We're just two cool guys,
just hanging out...

41:49.757 --> 41:50.840
Sam!

41:55.554 --> 41:58.932
I've got the wheel! I've got it!
Sam! Oh God, Sam!

42:04.522 --> 42:08.650
You've gotta move your legs.
Can somebody move his legs?

42:10.319 --> 42:14.239
Sam, get your foot off the pedal!

42:14.240 --> 42:18.243
- I gotta stop this thing!
- No! Don't! Stay above 50!

42:18.244 --> 42:24.123
- Sam's been shot! We gotta get him off!
- You slow down and this bus'll explode!

42:29.046 --> 42:31.881
There is a bomb on this bus.

42:31.882 --> 42:34.634
If we slow down, it'll blow.

42:35.970 --> 42:40.139
If anyone tries to get off, it'll explode.

42:40.140 --> 42:42.725
Bullshit! Yeah, there's a bomb.

42:42.726 --> 42:46.020
- Some funny joke, man.
- Are we gonna have a problem now?

42:46.021 --> 42:49.190
He's bleeding so much.
I don't know what to do.

42:49.191 --> 42:54.737
Put pressure front and back, keep
his legs up and put this under his head.

42:54.738 --> 42:57.740
- Hold on, man.
- Sam, lift your head.

42:57.741 --> 43:01.369
- Can you handle this bus?
- Sure. It's like driving a really big Pinto.

43:01.370 --> 43:07.000
- I need to know! Can you handle it?
- I'm fine. Just tell me what the plan is.

43:07.001 --> 43:09.877
- Is there a plan?
- For you to drive. We're OK for now.

43:09.878 --> 43:12.213
- Just keep us above 50.
- Good plan.

43:15.634 --> 43:18.344
- So, you're a cop, right?
- That's right.

43:18.345 --> 43:22.765
Well, I should probably tell you that
I had my driver's licence revoked.

43:23.684 --> 43:26.144
- What for?
- Speeding.

43:30.024 --> 43:34.068
Harry, we're on our way to the chopper.
If anything changes, let us know.

43:34.069 --> 43:36.946
Anything we haven't seen
should be in here.

44:07.645 --> 44:11.481
..wrong with the driver,
but at Ieast one car, a Jaguar,

44:11.482 --> 44:15.652
has been driven off the road
by the speeding bus.

44:15.653 --> 44:19.197
The bus came onto the freeway
at the Lincoln onramp.

44:19.198 --> 44:23.117
It began picking up speed, swerving,
and hasn't slowed down since.

44:23.118 --> 44:28.498
Minutes ago a police officer boarded the bus
by jumping onto it from a moving car.

44:28.499 --> 44:32.126
Would that be you, Jack?

44:32.127 --> 44:34.295
- Where do we start?
- The speedometer.

44:34.630 --> 44:38.883
Has it been fucked with or loosened?
See any wires or anything?

44:38.884 --> 44:40.885
Excuse me, ma'am.

44:40.886 --> 44:43.054
No, it's clean.

44:43.055 --> 44:46.599
Then it's gonna be under the bus.
Probably rigged to one of the axles.

44:46.600 --> 44:50.019
I can't get under the bus right now.
It's kind of in motion.

44:50.020 --> 44:52.355
Excuse me! Excuse me!

44:53.399 --> 44:54.565
Hold on.

44:54.566 --> 44:57.276
Access panel... in the floor.

44:58.445 --> 45:00.530
Underneath you, man.

45:02.741 --> 45:08.871
All right, Harry. We're in. Passenger relay.
Sir, take this. I want you to tell him what I see.

45:10.708 --> 45:12.542
OK.

45:12.543 --> 45:15.545
We got a wad! Pretty big!

45:15.546 --> 45:18.172
- There's a pretty big wad.
- Brass fittings!

45:18.173 --> 45:21.592
- Brass fittings.
- I think I can reach the circuit wire.

45:21.593 --> 45:26.097
- He can reach the circuit wire.
- No, don't. That's a decoy. Classic.

45:26.098 --> 45:28.182
- Classic decoy.
- What else?

45:28.183 --> 45:30.476
- What else?
- Hold on.

45:30.477 --> 45:32.603
Hold on.

45:41.447 --> 45:42.780
Fuck me!

45:45.159 --> 45:46.367
Oh, darn.

45:49.204 --> 45:53.082
Harry, there's enough C4 on this thing
to put a hole in the world.

45:53.083 --> 45:56.210
OK, all right. Just stay calm. What else?

45:56.211 --> 45:59.714
Three triggers - one on the axle
I can't really see, a cellular remote

45:59.715 --> 46:03.593
and a timer running off a wristwatch.

46:03.594 --> 46:06.179
- A watch? What kind of watch?
- Gold.

46:06.180 --> 46:08.473
Gold band. Fairly cheesy.

46:08.474 --> 46:10.850
Officer!

46:10.851 --> 46:13.352
- Officer!
- What's on your mind, Harry?

46:13.353 --> 46:16.397
Shit. What do I do? Officer!

46:16.398 --> 46:17.857
- What do I do?
- Oh, shit.

46:17.858 --> 46:20.568
- Which way? Which way?!
- Get on the shoulder.

46:20.569 --> 46:21.694
OK.

46:34.708 --> 46:35.750
Watch it!

46:43.383 --> 46:46.969
Stay on or get off? Stay on or get off?

46:46.970 --> 46:49.972
Off! Off! Hold on!

47:07.491 --> 47:09.158
Oh, God.

47:14.748 --> 47:17.166
- Keep going.
- It's red!

47:17.167 --> 47:19.710
Go! Go!

47:34.309 --> 47:36.060
This is much better.

47:38.480 --> 47:43.401
..city streets. The bus is on Western,
heading in a southbound direction.

47:43.402 --> 47:47.697
Now, where the bus did exit here,
it had a coupIe of cIose caIls.

47:47.698 --> 47:50.408
Yeah! Yeah! All right!

47:51.285 --> 47:53.661
We don't know what authorities pIan to do.

48:02.629 --> 48:05.214
I don't get it.

48:05.215 --> 48:08.926
The watch is a shitty timer.
Why use it? What's he saying?

48:08.927 --> 48:12.346
- Lots of people have watches, Harry.
- This guy has no MO.

48:12.347 --> 48:16.225
A bomber falls in love with one kind
of bomb and they're very monogamous.

48:16.226 --> 48:21.689
This guy uses C4, dynamite, different trigger
every time, and now he throws in this watch.

48:21.690 --> 48:24.692
He's an encyclopaedia of bombs.
He knows every kind.

48:24.693 --> 48:27.820
Yeah, and everything we do to dismantle it.

48:29.948 --> 48:32.033
Wait a minute.

48:33.035 --> 48:35.828
I wanna look at the files for the last 10 years.

48:35.829 --> 48:40.958
- We did the mug shots. It's not gonna help.
- No. I wanna look at cops.

48:40.959 --> 48:43.044
Come on. Let's go.

48:49.301 --> 48:52.136
Yeah. Mac, where have you been?

48:52.137 --> 48:55.056
I had to bail on the freeway.
We're in the city.

48:55.057 --> 48:58.351
I can see you. Just keep going straight.

48:58.352 --> 49:02.229
I'm gonna try to clear the roads for you.
Just stay on line.

49:05.859 --> 49:08.444
Shit! Oh, Jesus! God! No!

49:08.445 --> 49:09.445
Go left!

49:10.530 --> 49:13.449
- Sorry.
- Oh, my God!

49:21.833 --> 49:22.959
Oh, jeez!

49:25.337 --> 49:28.923
People, stay out of my way!
Stay out of my way!

49:28.924 --> 49:32.760
- Ma'am, up to the right.
- OK, OK, OK. I see it, I see it.

49:39.476 --> 49:42.770
Mac! Mac, you've gotta get me outta here!

49:45.941 --> 49:50.277
A few more blocks,
you're gonna come up to a soft turn. Right.

49:50.278 --> 49:53.531
Then hold straight. I've got
some units waiting for you there.

49:53.532 --> 49:58.619
They're gonna lead you to the 105 freeway.
It's not in use. It'll be empty.

49:58.620 --> 50:01.372
- You'll be totally clear.
- Got it.

50:04.835 --> 50:08.587
In a few blocks,
we take the soft turn to the right.

50:11.633 --> 50:15.261
OK. Wait a minute. Escort to where?
Where do we get an escort to?

50:15.262 --> 50:17.304
Look out!

50:19.307 --> 50:20.474
Oh, God!

50:26.189 --> 50:27.690
Son of a bitch!

50:27.691 --> 50:30.192
Oh, Jesus! Oh, God!

50:32.112 --> 50:36.032
- Oh, God! I just hit the baby!
- Cans!

50:36.033 --> 50:40.161
- There was no baby. It was full of cans.
- Are you sure?

51:00.223 --> 51:02.141
Oh, jeez. No! No! No!

51:10.734 --> 51:14.612
- Why aren't they at school?
- Mac, we're boned.

51:14.613 --> 51:16.447
I'll get you out, Jack.

51:25.999 --> 51:29.126
All right, listen.
You got an entrance coming up, Jack.

51:29.127 --> 51:32.004
It's gonna be a real ugly turn, though.

51:32.005 --> 51:34.632
- How ugly?
- What's ugly?

51:34.633 --> 51:38.844
We got a hard right coming up
at the construction site.

51:38.845 --> 51:41.806
- This should be it.
- That is a dead end.

51:41.807 --> 51:46.268
- I can't make that turn.
- You can make it. Keep left. Make it wide.

51:46.269 --> 51:49.647
Oh, God. We're gonna tip over.
We're gonna tip over.

51:49.648 --> 51:53.609
You're right. We're gonna tip over.
Everyone on this side of the bus now!

51:53.610 --> 51:56.529
On this side of the bus!
As far as you can, please.

51:56.530 --> 51:58.697
Hold on!

51:58.698 --> 52:03.953
Over here. Over here. As far as you can! Now!
Mac, you better clear this site out.

52:11.378 --> 52:13.712
- Everybody hold on!
- This side of the bus!

52:13.713 --> 52:15.881
Hold on!

52:17.509 --> 52:21.637
Hold on! Oh, God! Here we go! Here we go!

52:24.766 --> 52:26.308
Here we go!

52:41.283 --> 52:44.201
Oh, my God! Oh, God! Is everybody all right?

52:44.202 --> 52:46.537
- Yes!
- Oh, my God.

52:46.538 --> 52:49.206
Take me to that interchange at the 105.

52:59.759 --> 53:04.054
Oh, my God. We might've died. I can't think.

53:04.055 --> 53:07.766
It's OK. If you need to,
you go right ahead and vomit.

53:26.369 --> 53:30.664
Frank, get rid of that scaffolding
and replace it with webbing.

53:30.665 --> 53:34.710
Norwood, I want aerial units up ahead.
No obstructions in the freeway.

53:34.711 --> 53:38.297
We have a window here.
I wanna make sure it stays open.

53:59.319 --> 54:00.569
Shoot.

54:01.780 --> 54:05.574
Could you do me a favour
and hold the wheel for me for a second?

54:05.575 --> 54:08.077
Hold the wheel? Thank you.

54:08.078 --> 54:14.291
Ma'am, you did very well. Actually, you were
incredible. I've never seen driving like that.

54:14.292 --> 54:16.085
- Annie.
- What?

54:16.086 --> 54:18.545
It's my name. Annie.

54:18.546 --> 54:21.799
- Annie.
- As opposed to "ma'am".

54:21.800 --> 54:23.342
OK.

54:26.846 --> 54:30.391
So, why is all this happening?

54:30.392 --> 54:35.145
I mean, what did we do?
Bomb the guy's country or something?

54:35.146 --> 54:37.856
No. It's just a guy who wants money.

54:39.192 --> 54:42.611
I don't buy that.
It's not a very good way to make money.

54:43.863 --> 54:47.408
So... what is this guy's deal?

54:49.035 --> 54:52.037
A while back,
he held some people for ransom.

54:52.038 --> 54:55.374
It went sour,
and now he's a little pissed at me.

54:55.375 --> 54:59.545
- What does that have to do with us?
- Nothing. It's a game.

54:59.546 --> 55:03.173
If he gets the money, he wins.
If the bus blows up, he wins.

55:03.174 --> 55:06.010
- What if you win?
- Tomorrow we'll play another one.

55:06.011 --> 55:09.054
But I'm not available
to drive tomorrow. Busy.

55:13.226 --> 55:15.728
We got no match for that description.

55:15.729 --> 55:18.522
No one's lost a thumb
for at least the last 10 years.

55:18.523 --> 55:21.859
- He could be from anywhere.
- I can't access all that.

55:21.860 --> 55:25.195
Forget the files.
Start going through the pension fund.

55:25.196 --> 55:29.074
This guy's drawing disability. He may not
be LAPD, but he's living here now.

55:29.075 --> 55:32.369
I want pictures! I've seen this asshole.

55:46.801 --> 55:51.221
- Hey! Let's get these passengers off the bus!
- We can't do it, sir!

55:51.222 --> 55:55.225
There's no time for any stunts.
We gotta get these people out of harm's way.

55:55.226 --> 55:58.604
I got orders. We move these people, he'll see.

56:01.191 --> 56:03.567
Remember: crazy, not stupid.

56:03.568 --> 56:08.155
Harry's trying to find out who this guy is.
We think maybe he's a cop.

56:08.156 --> 56:10.866
Lieutenant, it's him.

56:10.867 --> 56:14.370
- He wants to talk to Jack.
- He's on the line for you.

56:14.371 --> 56:18.332
- OK, give him the number.
- Give him the number.

56:21.002 --> 56:23.504
- How's he doing?
- The bleeding is less, but...

56:23.505 --> 56:27.216
- Are they going to help us?
- Sure they are. They're the police.

56:27.217 --> 56:31.970
Hey, your taxes are paying their salary.
If we die, they gotta take a pay cut.

56:34.808 --> 56:36.392
I mean, you know.

56:40.105 --> 56:41.021
Yeah.

56:41.022 --> 56:46.860
I think we have trust, but it looks on TV
like you're trying to get those passengers off.

56:46.861 --> 56:50.364
- Look, you've gotta let me have one.
- We went over the rules.

56:50.365 --> 56:54.368
As an act of faith. We have
an injured man here. The driver's been shot.

56:54.369 --> 56:57.204
Tell me you haven't
been shooting the passengers.

56:57.205 --> 57:02.209
I thought it was customary
for a police officer to shoot the bad guys.

57:02.210 --> 57:06.213
- This man has no time.
- No one gets off.

57:06.214 --> 57:11.468
It'll grease the wheels with the money men.
There's still gonna be plenty of us to kill.

57:12.512 --> 57:15.722
OK, son, you can try and unload the driver.

57:15.723 --> 57:20.144
You tell that wildcat behind the wheel
not to slow down, though,

57:20.145 --> 57:24.731
or he won't even get a chance
to bleed to death. And, Jack, don't slip.

57:26.151 --> 57:30.487
- He's letting us unload the driver.
- Norwood! Get us closer!

57:31.865 --> 57:34.199
- We're gonna get the driver off.
- Just him?

57:34.200 --> 57:36.535
- For now. Gigantor.
- Ortiz.

57:36.536 --> 57:40.622
Ortiz, we're gonna need your help.
I need you to pass him to me.

57:40.623 --> 57:43.083
Keep him straight, or the wound'll tear.

57:43.084 --> 57:46.837
- What about the rest of us?
- Hey, hey, hey! Lady!

57:48.590 --> 57:50.674
I can't stay!

57:51.885 --> 57:54.928
- How are you feeling?
- Like I've been shot.

57:54.929 --> 57:57.014
- Take care, Sam.
- OK, Annie.

57:57.974 --> 58:00.559
Drive straight!

58:03.521 --> 58:07.733
- Get as close as you can, OK?
- All right.

58:07.734 --> 58:11.278
Closer. A little closer, Annie.

58:12.989 --> 58:15.073
- Annie, a little closer.
- OK.

58:17.285 --> 58:19.786
OK, how's this?

58:21.414 --> 58:23.707
Sorry. Sorry.

58:23.708 --> 58:27.211
OK, Annie. No problem.
Let's try it one more time.

58:28.338 --> 58:29.963
A little more!

58:29.964 --> 58:33.050
OK! OK! Right there! Steady! Hold it steady!

58:34.385 --> 58:36.887
You got him? You got him?

58:41.643 --> 58:43.727
All right.

58:43.728 --> 58:46.271
I'm all right. Thanks.

58:46.272 --> 58:48.732
- Oh, my God.
- Yes!

58:58.576 --> 59:00.661
He's gonna be OK.

59:03.498 --> 59:05.916
Come on! Come on, lady. Give me your hand.

59:05.917 --> 59:08.752
- I have to, Annie.
- No, Helen!

59:08.753 --> 59:11.088
- No, Helen, no!
- Come on!

59:11.089 --> 59:12.256
Helen, no! No!

59:12.257 --> 59:17.678
I'm here at the 105 Freeway, where the police
have successfulIy Ied the runaway bus...

59:20.390 --> 59:21.848
No, Helen!

59:37.240 --> 59:40.617
Goddamn it, Mac!
Get those fucking choppers outta here!

59:40.618 --> 59:44.037
..was driving the bus.
WelI, I couIdn't teIl how old...

59:44.038 --> 59:46.957
An explosion. Some kind of an expIosion.

59:46.958 --> 59:50.127
The bus hasn't exploded, but... Oh, my God.

59:50.128 --> 59:54.631
A woman caught in the blast felI. She was
puIled under the wheels. This is terrible.

59:54.632 --> 59:58.885
Interactive TV, Jack. Wave of the future, huh?

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:22.743
I can't be here.

01:00:24.287 --> 01:00:26.955
I can't, you know...

01:00:26.956 --> 01:00:29.499
This is the wrong bus.

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:31.585
I mean, for me to...

01:00:33.421 --> 01:00:35.464
I can't die here.

01:00:35.465 --> 01:00:37.549
Hey, shut up, man.

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.219
- I got a wife.
- Oh, you do?

01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:45.891
Hey! So if you have a wife and I don't,
does that mean I'm expendable?

01:00:45.892 --> 01:00:48.268
What are you talking about, man?

01:00:48.269 --> 01:00:50.562
The guy's just talking crazy.

01:00:50.563 --> 01:00:53.565
He gets on my nerves.
He gets on everybody's nerves.

01:00:53.566 --> 01:00:59.237
- I think I have the right to be a little upset.
- What are you staring at, anyway?

01:00:59.238 --> 01:01:02.199
Why don't you let us all die in peace,
if it has to happen?

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:07.204
Oh, so you're a really tough guy, huh?
Why don't we just step outside?

01:01:07.205 --> 01:01:09.289
Hey!

01:01:23.262 --> 01:01:25.764
How are you doing? You all right?

01:01:26.641 --> 01:01:28.767
What can I do?

01:01:30.311 --> 01:01:32.938
When that bomb went off...

01:01:32.939 --> 01:01:34.940
I know.

01:01:34.941 --> 01:01:39.903
I thought that was it.
I thought that was the bomb, and I was dead.

01:01:39.904 --> 01:01:44.282
And then when I saw her body fall
under the bus, it was like...

01:01:44.283 --> 01:01:46.785
You were glad you were still alive.

01:01:48.871 --> 01:01:51.707
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't be.

01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:54.209
You should be glad. We all are.

01:01:56.254 --> 01:01:59.506
- It doesn't mean you don't care.
- I know, but she was so scared.

01:01:59.507 --> 01:02:02.759
She was a nice lady
who didn't deserve to get killed,

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:06.012
but if she'd gotten off,
it would have killed us all.

01:02:06.013 --> 01:02:10.559
He's the asshole, Annie. The guy
who put us here. Remember that, OK?

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:14.104
Big asshole.

01:02:14.105 --> 01:02:16.189
OK.

01:02:18.609 --> 01:02:20.819
Are you sure?

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:22.904
Well, how far?

01:02:25.783 --> 01:02:27.951
Sir, we have a serious problem.

01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:30.620
What?

01:02:30.621 --> 01:02:34.791
- This freeway isn't finished.
- What are you talking about?

01:02:34.792 --> 01:02:40.255
The aerial unit caught it. About three miles
ahead there's a section missing.

01:02:40.256 --> 01:02:42.299
A section missing?

01:02:47.221 --> 01:02:51.308
But it's on the map.
It's finished on the goddamn map!

01:02:51.309 --> 01:02:53.393
I guess they fell behind.

01:02:54.896 --> 01:02:58.440
Fuck! You're fired. Everybody's fucking fired!

01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:02.152
Get me closer!

01:03:02.153 --> 01:03:05.822
Hey, get closer. Watch him in the mirror.

01:03:05.823 --> 01:03:07.949
Jack!

01:03:10.161 --> 01:03:13.789
- How big is the section?
- 50 feet... at least.

01:03:19.128 --> 01:03:22.923
There's a gap in the road up ahead. It's big.

01:03:22.924 --> 01:03:26.968
- You're kidding. How big?
- 50 feet.

01:03:26.969 --> 01:03:28.512
What?

01:03:28.513 --> 01:03:31.014
We gotta get these people
off the bus somehow.

01:03:31.015 --> 01:03:34.142
You know I can't.

01:03:34.143 --> 01:03:36.645
What did he say? Jack?

01:03:37.939 --> 01:03:40.440
Jack, what did he say?

01:03:41.943 --> 01:03:44.236
What's the matter?

01:03:49.283 --> 01:03:53.286
- There's a gap in the freeway.
- What?

01:03:53.287 --> 01:03:56.289
- What do you mean?
- How big is a gap?

01:03:56.290 --> 01:03:59.501
50 feet. A couple of miles ahead.

01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:01.586
This is crazy.

01:04:06.092 --> 01:04:08.635
- Jeez.
- Jack.

01:04:08.636 --> 01:04:12.514
Jack. What if I shift into neutral
and just keep the engine revving?

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:16.977
- No, he'd have thought of that.
- What, then? What? What?

01:04:16.978 --> 01:04:19.646
What? Jack?

01:04:19.647 --> 01:04:21.314
- Floor it.
- What?

01:04:21.315 --> 01:04:24.651
Floor it. It's an interchange.
There might be an incline.

01:04:24.652 --> 01:04:26.403
Fine.

01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:32.993
Everybody hold onto your seats
or whatever you can.

01:04:32.994 --> 01:04:36.162
When we hit the gap, heads down.

01:04:36.163 --> 01:04:38.582
That's it? That's it?

01:04:38.583 --> 01:04:43.795
That's all we can do. Let's put these
underneath your seat, all right?

01:04:43.796 --> 01:04:46.298
Put your bags underneath the seat.

01:04:50.803 --> 01:04:54.431
- Hey, I didn't mean to shoot the guy.
- Hold on.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:58.476
Is this really gonna work?

01:04:58.477 --> 01:04:59.811
Jack.

01:05:01.981 --> 01:05:04.316
Yeah?

01:05:04.317 --> 01:05:06.443
Jack.

01:05:26.714 --> 01:05:30.300
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Oh, God.

01:05:30.301 --> 01:05:32.594
- Come on!
- Oh, God.

01:05:41.896 --> 01:05:43.063
Oh, shit.

01:05:56.452 --> 01:05:59.162
Everybody hold on!

01:06:16.138 --> 01:06:18.473
Oh, God. Jack.

01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:26.856
Shit!

01:06:48.254 --> 01:06:52.632
Yes! We are way out of control!

01:07:00.141 --> 01:07:01.474
- You OK?
- Yeah.

01:07:01.475 --> 01:07:03.143
- You OK?
- I'm OK.

01:07:03.144 --> 01:07:06.563
All right! Norwood, let's go!

01:07:06.564 --> 01:07:09.399
- Is everybody OK?
- Yes!

01:07:12.570 --> 01:07:14.654
We did it!

01:07:14.655 --> 01:07:16.948
We made it.

01:07:16.949 --> 01:07:20.285
You're the man. You are the man!

01:07:20.286 --> 01:07:22.370
Thank you. Thank you very much.

01:07:24.373 --> 01:07:25.957
Oh, shit.

01:07:25.958 --> 01:07:30.128
- I think you missed your calling.
- Yeah? What was it?

01:07:30.129 --> 01:07:32.839
Watch the road.
You should have been a pilot.

01:07:41.015 --> 01:07:42.348
- Get off.
- What?

01:07:42.349 --> 01:07:44.434
Get off this. Now. Get off this.

01:07:50.608 --> 01:07:52.358
In there.

01:07:52.359 --> 01:07:54.360
- Where? Right here?
- Yeah.

01:07:54.361 --> 01:07:55.779
- Right here?
- Yeah.

01:08:00.242 --> 01:08:01.743
Hey! Hey! Hey, stop!

01:08:11.837 --> 01:08:15.548
- He's just entered the airport.
- There's thousands of people there.

01:08:15.549 --> 01:08:18.968
That's my boy Jack. He can circle
the runways and buy us some time.

01:08:18.969 --> 01:08:23.890
- Choppers can't fly there. It's restricted.
- He's headed for the end of the field.

01:08:23.890 --> 01:08:28.228
- Bravo Tango, an emergency runway.
- Let's hope it's built. Let's move!

01:08:41.408 --> 01:08:44.077
We're at the airport.

01:08:44.078 --> 01:08:46.121
Yeah? So?

01:08:47.163 --> 01:08:49.249
I already seen the airport.

01:09:10.354 --> 01:09:14.232
- Yeah?
- Very, very exciting, Jack.

01:09:14.233 --> 01:09:18.569
Some close calls, huh?
But you've done all right for yourself.

01:09:18.571 --> 01:09:21.865
- What do you want?
- I want money, Jack.

01:09:21.866 --> 01:09:28.121
I wish I had some loftier purpose, but
I'm afraid in the end it's just the money, Jack.

01:09:28.122 --> 01:09:35.336
I would like large non-sequential bills
in two clear plastic bags, unmarked.

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:39.215
- Can you remember all that?
- What are you telling me for?

01:09:39.216 --> 01:09:42.551
Because I want you to help me
to get it before it gets too late.

01:09:42.553 --> 01:09:46.514
I hate negotiators, Jack. They talk to you
like they're your best friend

01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:48.683
and they don't even know you.

01:09:48.684 --> 01:09:53.188
Why are they messing with me, huh?
Do they think I'm doing this for fun?

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:56.649
- Aren't you?
- Oh, that's unfair, Jack.

01:09:56.650 --> 01:10:01.154
You don't know how I feel about this.
You don't even know me.

01:10:01.155 --> 01:10:03.656
You want a shitload of money
you didn't earn.

01:10:03.657 --> 01:10:05.950
Oh, I earned it.

01:10:05.951 --> 01:10:08.286
I spent my life earning it.

01:10:08.287 --> 01:10:14.000
I got a medaI, too, Jack, a medaI and
a pink slip and a "sorry about your hand".

01:10:14.001 --> 01:10:17.295
- You have to let me off.
- Oh, no.

01:10:17.296 --> 01:10:20.256
- That's not good.
- You want me to help you?

01:10:20.257 --> 01:10:24.010
I need to talk to these people face to face.
They think you're bullshit.

01:10:24.011 --> 01:10:26.179
They don't think that.

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:31.017
Look, you want the money, I don't want
anyone else to die. Let me get on the ground.

01:10:31.018 --> 01:10:34.187
Just me. That's not against the rules.

01:10:34.188 --> 01:10:36.272
All right. I want you back real fast.

01:10:37.608 --> 01:10:39.025
Fine.

01:10:39.026 --> 01:10:42.904
Jack, nothing tricky now.
You know that I'm on top of you.

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:45.823
Do not attempt to grow a brain.

01:10:55.125 --> 01:10:58.920
- So I guess there's a plan now?
- Could be.

01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:01.172
- Yeah?
- He's letting me off.

01:11:01.173 --> 01:11:04.384
- What?
- Just keep circling. You'll be fine.

01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:10.098
- Sit tight. I'm getting off for a minute.
- Do you think that's a good idea?

01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:12.892
- It'll be OK.
- Are you just gonna leave us here?

01:11:12.893 --> 01:11:16.271
- I would.
- Don't worry. I won't go far.

01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:19.774
Hey. Don't forget about us.

01:11:34.873 --> 01:11:37.709
The choppers are gone.
Let's dump the passengers.

01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:40.211
- He's ready for that.
- How is that possible?

01:11:40.212 --> 01:11:44.465
I don't know how. I just know he is.
He's been a step ahead every time.

01:11:44.466 --> 01:11:47.802
- If we unload, he'll take them out.
- So where does that put us?

01:11:47.803 --> 01:11:50.096
I have to try and dismantle that bomb.

01:11:50.681 --> 01:11:53.308
After an incredible ride on the 10 freeway,

01:11:53.309 --> 01:11:55.977
the streets of Los Angeles
and the 105 freeway,

01:11:55.978 --> 01:12:01.566
this bus has ended up here at Los Angeles
International Airport, circling the runway.

01:12:13.412 --> 01:12:16.122
I'm telling you, he's somewhere jerking off.

01:12:16.123 --> 01:12:20.001
He didn't have to get
on the bus in the first place, Ortiz.

01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:22.253
Get your ass behind the yellow line.

01:12:25.674 --> 01:12:28.176
What is that?

01:12:31.513 --> 01:12:33.598
I have no idea.

01:12:37.019 --> 01:12:39.520
We won't be able to hold this steady for long.

01:12:39.521 --> 01:12:44.025
I just need a few minutes.
If I can't do it by then, I can't do it at all.

01:12:44.026 --> 01:12:47.403
- Harry, you with me?
- Yeah. You be carefuI, Jack.

01:12:51.992 --> 01:12:55.828
What's he doing? Oh, my God. He is insane.

01:13:01.877 --> 01:13:05.713
OK, Jack, this is it. Don't get dead.

01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:22.814
- This is not a very good plan.
- Have faith, sister.

01:13:22.815 --> 01:13:23.815
Oh, Christ.

01:13:34.284 --> 01:13:36.494
Just keep it steady.

01:13:36.495 --> 01:13:38.996
Thank you for the tip, Ortiz.

01:13:50.509 --> 01:13:53.761
This guy is nuts!

01:13:53.762 --> 01:13:57.056
We'll try to bypass the remote current
with the battery.

01:13:57.057 --> 01:14:01.811
- Can you find the tripwire for the remote?
- I don't know. I got a few choices here.

01:14:01.812 --> 01:14:04.647
- Black and red?
- And green.

01:14:04.648 --> 01:14:09.152
OK, I'm gonna guess he's not gonna go
with standard copper for the remote.

01:14:09.153 --> 01:14:11.654
That'd be too weak. I'd use a fibre alloy.

01:14:11.655 --> 01:14:14.740
Jack, I'm gonna need you to look at the wire.

01:14:17.077 --> 01:14:18.411
Harry, it's covered.

01:14:18.412 --> 01:14:22.832
I know. You're gonna have to cut off
the sheath. But don't cut the wire.

01:14:22.833 --> 01:14:24.917
Right.

01:14:36.930 --> 01:14:39.015
Fuck me!

01:14:40.350 --> 01:14:42.435
Shit!

01:14:47.524 --> 01:14:48.858
- Bull's-eye!
- Great.

01:14:48.859 --> 01:14:52.528
OK. I want you to clip on the battery
and then run it to the lead wire.

01:14:52.529 --> 01:14:53.529
Copy.

01:15:10.839 --> 01:15:12.965
I can't bypass. It'll fire.

01:15:12.966 --> 01:15:15.468
Oh, shit! It's a collapsible circuit.

01:15:16.887 --> 01:15:22.767
Howard Payne, Atlanta PD Bomb Squad.
Retired in Sun Valley in 1989

01:15:22.768 --> 01:15:26.229
when a small charge left him
with fingers numbering nine.

01:15:26.230 --> 01:15:29.690
That's our scumbag!
We got him. Jack, we found him.

01:15:29.691 --> 01:15:33.569
- We can get to his place inside of 15 minutes.
- Jack, get out of there.

01:15:33.570 --> 01:15:36.197
- We're going after the source.
- Watch your back.

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:39.283
Wait for me!

01:15:39.993 --> 01:15:42.495
Mac, get me outta here.

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:58.719
Somebody go to the back and check
and see if he came out the back. Go!

01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:12.692
- Can you see him?
- He's not behind us.

01:16:12.693 --> 01:16:14.902
- What?
- He's not back here.

01:16:14.903 --> 01:16:16.404
Oh, my God. Go look!

01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:20.741
Lay down and look under the bus
and see if you can see him down there.

01:16:21.952 --> 01:16:23.619
- Can you see him?
- No.

01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:26.706
You don't see him
back by the tyre or something?

01:16:26.707 --> 01:16:28.958
- I can't see him.
- Are you sure?

01:16:28.959 --> 01:16:30.418
I can't see him.

01:16:52.774 --> 01:16:56.569
Oh, my God! We hit him!
Oh, my God! Do you see him?

01:16:56.570 --> 01:16:59.488
- Did we hit him?
- Look out the sides.

01:17:06.913 --> 01:17:10.041
- My tools!
- Will somebody get him his tools?!

01:17:22.012 --> 01:17:25.222
Please help him! Hurry!

01:17:25.223 --> 01:17:28.643
God, we're dragging him. Do you see him?

01:17:28.644 --> 01:17:30.936
Where is he? Is he there?

01:17:32.606 --> 01:17:36.734
- Do you see him?
- Jack! Jack!

01:17:36.735 --> 01:17:38.778
- I see him!
- What?

01:17:38.779 --> 01:17:41.238
- I see him!
- You do? Is he OK?

01:17:41.239 --> 01:17:44.909
He's all right! He's all right!

01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:48.371
Hold my legs. Hold my legs.
Somebody hold my legs.

01:17:48.372 --> 01:17:50.873
Hold his legs.

01:17:50.874 --> 01:17:53.042
- Hold his legs!
- Come on!

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:57.129
Come on! I got ya!

01:18:01.551 --> 01:18:06.263
- Is he hurt? Is he OK?
- Pull! Pull!

01:18:06.264 --> 01:18:08.474
Come on! Come on!

01:18:08.475 --> 01:18:10.851
We got him now. Come on, pull!

01:18:11.978 --> 01:18:13.938
Jesus. I can't believe it.

01:18:16.441 --> 01:18:19.151
You are a complete jerk. You know that?

01:18:20.987 --> 01:18:24.657
- Did you have any luck with the bomb?
- Yeah. It didn't go off.

01:18:26.243 --> 01:18:27.493
Ortiz, thanks.

01:18:27.494 --> 01:18:31.205
How many lives you got, man?

01:18:31.206 --> 01:18:36.627
You're not too bright, man,
but you got some big, round, hairy cojones.

01:18:38.296 --> 01:18:41.799
That's... very gross, Ortiz.

01:18:43.176 --> 01:18:45.678
Can't even pay him a compliment.

01:18:46.763 --> 01:18:50.057
- How you doing?
- You scared the shit out of me, Jack!

01:18:50.058 --> 01:18:52.393
Other than that, I'm fine.

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:56.063
- What is that smell?
- It's gas.

01:18:56.064 --> 01:18:58.524
- We're leaking gas?
- We are now.

01:19:02.904 --> 01:19:05.740
You felt you needed
another challenge or something?

01:19:05.741 --> 01:19:08.826
- Mac.
- Mac here. Go ahead.

01:19:08.827 --> 01:19:11.620
Can you get a fuel truck to pace us?
We're losing gas.

01:19:11.621 --> 01:19:17.251
- I'll see what I can find. How much time?
- 10 minutes? It doesn't look good.

01:19:17.252 --> 01:19:21.422
Gotcha. Norwood, get a fuel car
out here on the double.

01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:24.258
Is that gonna work?

01:19:24.259 --> 01:19:26.761
I don't know.

01:19:29.931 --> 01:19:31.307
Harry, save my life.

01:21:04.609 --> 01:21:07.486
Harry, tell me good news, man.

01:21:07.487 --> 01:21:10.322
Oh, I'm sorry, Jack. He didn't make it.

01:21:12.742 --> 01:21:14.368
You fuck!

01:21:16.162 --> 01:21:20.457
It was the watch that led him
to me, wasn't it? Huh?

01:21:20.458 --> 01:21:25.129
It seemed a little hammy to me to build
the bomb out of my precious retirement gift,

01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:30.801
but, you know, I figured a sign that said
"Howard Pane" would be ushin it.

01:21:33.013 --> 01:21:36.307
I'm gonna rip your fucking spine out,
I swear to God.

01:21:36.308 --> 01:21:39.310
You're gonna do exactly as you're told.

01:21:39.311 --> 01:21:43.480
Jack, we both know that he was the brains
of your particular operation.

01:21:43.481 --> 01:21:46.400
You can't beat me.
You're gonna pay me every dollar.

01:21:46.401 --> 01:21:51.196
Otherwise, you, the wildcat
and every innocent person on that bus

01:21:51.197 --> 01:21:54.116
are gonna end up just like your friend.

01:21:55.035 --> 01:21:58.996
Are you paying attention?
Jack, are you listening to me?

01:22:00.457 --> 01:22:03.459
- Jack? Jack?
- Yeah.

01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:08.505
Good. You tell them that
the drop point is Pershing Square.

01:22:09.925 --> 01:22:13.052
There's a garbage can
on the northeast corner.

01:22:13.053 --> 01:22:15.679
You drop the bags and leave.

01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:18.599
I don't show untiI aIl your people are gone.

01:22:19.476 --> 01:22:26.941
It's getting on to 11am, Jack, and I think
it's gonna be a very pretty day.

01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:38.327
Jack.

01:22:40.497 --> 01:22:45.125
Come on. Don't give up on me, Jack!
Jack, stop it! Jack, come on!

01:22:45.126 --> 01:22:48.379
Stop it, OK? Don't give up
on me right now, all right?

01:22:50.966 --> 01:22:56.428
We're really scared and we need you
right now. I can't do this by myself. Please?

01:22:56.429 --> 01:22:58.514
Jack, please.

01:23:02.852 --> 01:23:05.938
OK? Please. All right?

01:23:11.945 --> 01:23:15.531
- We're gonna die.
- No, we're not. We got this far, OK?

01:23:38.179 --> 01:23:40.222
I'll be damned.

01:23:44.019 --> 01:23:47.563
Did you go to the University of Arizona?

01:23:47.564 --> 01:23:49.898
- Yeah? So?
- Good football team.

01:23:50.859 --> 01:23:53.694
Yeah, I guess so. I don't really know.

01:23:53.695 --> 01:23:55.529
Arizona Wildcats.

01:23:57.699 --> 01:24:00.200
- Right.
- He can see you.

01:24:00.201 --> 01:24:04.204
- What?
- He can see you.

01:24:04.205 --> 01:24:07.207
Just keep looking straight ahead.

01:24:22.891 --> 01:24:26.852
He called you a wildcat before.
Bastard's got a camera right in your face.

01:24:26.853 --> 01:24:30.147
He can see the whole bus.
He's been playing me from minute one.

01:24:30.148 --> 01:24:34.568
- Well, he can see me, but can he hear me?
- Doesn't look like it. He's just watching.

01:24:34.569 --> 01:24:39.990
We are foIlowing the progress of what
is turning out to be a harrowing story,

01:24:39.991 --> 01:24:43.118
as a city bus,
rigged to expIode if it slows down,

01:24:43.119 --> 01:24:46.455
races around IiteraIly in circIes
at the Los AngeIes airport.

01:24:46.456 --> 01:24:51.376
The dead are a female passenger and a driver
of another bus, both blown up by the bomber.

01:24:51.377 --> 01:24:57.216
Others in jeopardy are the passengers of the
bus, heId hostage at the whim of a madman.

01:24:58.968 --> 01:25:02.054
"The whim of a madman."

01:25:02.055 --> 01:25:04.264
I like that.

01:25:04.265 --> 01:25:07.726
There's a camera on the bus
just over my left shoulder.

01:25:07.727 --> 01:25:10.813
I want you to stare straight ahead.

01:25:10.814 --> 01:25:14.316
Don't make any big movements, OK?

01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:17.736
It's Jack.

01:25:17.737 --> 01:25:19.863
Yeah, I know about Harry.

01:25:22.367 --> 01:25:24.701
Is that news van still around?

01:25:24.702 --> 01:25:27.621
- Get those cameras to stop taping.
- Right.

01:25:28.748 --> 01:25:32.084
LAPD. I need this unit.
You can broadcast UHF, right?

01:25:32.085 --> 01:25:35.629
There's a signal going to that bus.
I want you to find it.

01:25:35.630 --> 01:25:38.632
We're gonna have to take you off the air.

01:25:38.633 --> 01:25:40.968
Please, sir, stop taping.

01:25:40.969 --> 01:25:44.263
Come on, hurry up. Good! Tape off of that.

01:25:47.851 --> 01:25:51.478
Remember, no big movements.
Just look whipped.

01:25:51.479 --> 01:25:54.189
That ain't gonna be too hard.

01:26:05.535 --> 01:26:08.495
- Tape it. Good. Come on, tape it.
- It's taping!

01:26:18.798 --> 01:26:20.382
- Jack.
- Yeah?

01:26:20.383 --> 01:26:22.509
Look.

01:26:26.014 --> 01:26:29.391
- Mac, fuel.
- Jack, five minutes.

01:26:29.392 --> 01:26:32.269
Not enough time. Run the tape.
We have to unload.

01:26:32.270 --> 01:26:35.063
- I only have a minute of tape.
- Do it now.

01:26:35.064 --> 01:26:38.817
I want you to make a tape and loop it
so that it runs over and over, OK?

01:26:41.654 --> 01:26:46.533
- All right, run it. Run it!
- All right. Tape's rolling.

01:26:46.534 --> 01:26:51.788
We stilI have no live picture, but reports
are that the bus continues to circIe...

01:26:53.541 --> 01:26:57.044
Everyone is safe for the moment.

01:26:57.045 --> 01:27:00.881
Hard to imagine what's going
through their thoughts at this time.

01:27:00.882 --> 01:27:03.217
Certainly, a sense of community...

01:27:21.569 --> 01:27:24.863
Rig the steering wheel and the gas pedal.

01:27:27.242 --> 01:27:30.077
All right, let's get 'em off.

01:27:30.078 --> 01:27:32.079
OK, you, you, and you.

01:27:33.373 --> 01:27:38.502
Police have just issued a generaI statement,
which doesn't telI us much more...

01:27:38.503 --> 01:27:42.089
Grab my wrist. That's it. Good.

01:27:42.090 --> 01:27:44.549
Come on. Look straight ahead.

01:28:03.486 --> 01:28:07.114
- That's good, that's good.
- Grab my wrist.

01:28:07.115 --> 01:28:09.366
Put your hand out. Take his hand.

01:28:21.921 --> 01:28:23.964
Come on, buddy. I got ya.

01:28:23.965 --> 01:28:26.758
Give me your hand. Your hand.

01:28:28.594 --> 01:28:31.430
Grab my hand. Don't look down.

01:28:34.267 --> 01:28:36.560
Shit!

01:28:36.561 --> 01:28:38.895
Jack!

01:28:40.773 --> 01:28:43.734
Grab my hand! Grab my hand!

01:28:51.659 --> 01:28:54.661
Jack! Jack, I can't hold this any more.

01:28:54.662 --> 01:28:56.496
Annie!

01:28:56.497 --> 01:28:57.831
You... hold on!

01:29:01.711 --> 01:29:03.795
No! No! No!

01:29:06.090 --> 01:29:07.257
Hold it.

01:29:14.307 --> 01:29:18.018
- Oh, God.
- Wedge down the gas pedal.

01:29:21.522 --> 01:29:23.607
OK, I got it.

01:29:34.077 --> 01:29:36.828
- You got it?
- Yeah. I got it.

01:29:45.588 --> 01:29:48.590
- OK, Annie, get on.
- Jack, I can't do this.

01:29:49.759 --> 01:29:53.136
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Shit. Shit.

01:29:55.098 --> 01:29:56.681
- Jack.
- Shit!

01:29:58.267 --> 01:29:59.851
Hold on.

01:31:25.563 --> 01:31:27.606
Shit!

01:31:34.030 --> 01:31:36.198
Are you all right?

01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:39.659
No.

01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:43.622
It's OK. It's OK. It's over.

01:31:43.623 --> 01:31:47.542
It's over. You did it. You did it.

01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:55.091
I hate the airport.

01:32:00.932 --> 01:32:04.351
You're not gonna get mushy on me, are you?

01:32:04.352 --> 01:32:07.771
Maybe. I might.

01:32:10.107 --> 01:32:14.778
I hope not, cos relationships that start
under intense circumstances never last.

01:32:14.779 --> 01:32:18.031
- Oh, yeah?
- I've done extensive studying on this.

01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:20.992
Here comes the cavalry.

01:32:37.093 --> 01:32:39.594
- How ya doing?
- We're OK.

01:32:41.722 --> 01:32:45.308
I just might be a nice guy
and let you have the rest of the day off.

01:32:45.309 --> 01:32:47.435
Oh, boy.

01:32:47.436 --> 01:32:50.272
Mac, this is Annie.

01:32:50.273 --> 01:32:53.483
Annie, meet Lieutenant McMahon.

01:32:53.484 --> 01:32:55.569
- How you doing?
- OK.

01:32:56.362 --> 01:32:59.531
This should take care of it.

01:32:59.532 --> 01:33:02.701
- Watch it.
- Sorry.

01:33:02.702 --> 01:33:06.079
- We're gonna have you guys checked out.
- Lieutenant!

01:33:07.790 --> 01:33:10.667
It's him. He wants to know
when he's gonna get his money.

01:33:10.668 --> 01:33:13.712
I'll tell him what to do
with his goddamn money.

01:33:13.713 --> 01:33:16.214
He doesn't know it blew up.

01:33:19.552 --> 01:33:20.927
30 minutes.

01:34:01.010 --> 01:34:03.094
I'll be right back.

01:34:06.015 --> 01:34:12.020
All right, here's our target. Fox, I want you
in 4-1, you in 1-2. You're in 3. Let's move it.

01:34:12.021 --> 01:34:15.315
- Is the paint bomb in with the money?
- It's done, sir.

01:35:15.501 --> 01:35:18.461
Too bad, Jack.
You could've made a good cop.

01:35:21.090 --> 01:35:23.133
OK.

01:35:24.719 --> 01:35:31.307
We stilI have no live picture. Reports are
that the bus continues to circIe inside LAX.

01:35:39.024 --> 01:35:41.776
No! No!

01:36:05.634 --> 01:36:08.845
Miss, you can't be this close.
You need to move back.

01:36:08.846 --> 01:36:10.430
No. Jack Traven said...

01:36:10.431 --> 01:36:14.809
Jack Traven asked that you be brought
out of harm's way. Just move right over here.

01:36:15.728 --> 01:36:18.813
- He's running a little late.
- He's not late.

01:36:20.357 --> 01:36:23.276
- What?
- He's never late.

01:36:23.277 --> 01:36:25.820
Well, that money hasn't moved.

01:36:25.821 --> 01:36:30.825
We got 200 eyes on that can, a bird dog
in the bag. I'd say he's covered.

01:36:35.372 --> 01:36:37.832
- Turn it on.
- What for? It hasn't moved.

01:36:37.833 --> 01:36:39.918
Just do it.

01:36:47.301 --> 01:36:50.345
Shit. It's moving. He's got the money.

01:36:50.346 --> 01:36:52.430
Jack!

01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:03.441
Shit!

01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:22.877
Freeze!

01:37:22.878 --> 01:37:26.631
Pop quiz, asshole.
You have a hair trigger aimed at your head.

01:37:26.632 --> 01:37:30.385
What do you do? What do you do?

01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:35.682
Turn around. Turn around!

01:37:54.410 --> 01:37:57.537
- Oh, no.
- I'm sorry.

01:37:59.790 --> 01:38:01.875
Be prepared.

01:38:01.876 --> 01:38:04.711
It's the Boy Scout marching song.

01:38:04.712 --> 01:38:09.215
What are you gonna do, Jack?
I don't think you can shoot her.

01:38:09.216 --> 01:38:10.466
Let her go.

01:38:11.927 --> 01:38:14.637
No, I don't think I'm gonna do that.

01:38:14.638 --> 01:38:17.265
Fill it. Now.

01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:26.649
I think Harry would be very disappointed,
feeling that we're right back where we started.

01:38:26.650 --> 01:38:30.445
Let her go. You don't need her.
You have the money. Take it and walk.

01:38:30.446 --> 01:38:34.032
Come on. Just take it and walk.
You don't need her.

01:38:34.033 --> 01:38:37.368
- Just take your goddamn money and walk!
- Stay right there.

01:38:37.369 --> 01:38:40.663
I'll do it. I'll let go. I'll let go.

01:38:40.664 --> 01:38:42.707
Oh, yeah.

01:38:42.708 --> 01:38:47.295
You still don't get it, do you, Jack? Huh?
The beauty of it.

01:38:48.213 --> 01:38:53.301
A bomb is made to explode.
That's its meaning, its purpose.

01:38:53.302 --> 01:38:59.849
Your life is empty because you spend it
trying to stop the bomb from becoming.

01:38:59.850 --> 01:39:01.935
And for who? For what?

01:39:03.145 --> 01:39:06.898
Do you know what a bomb is, Jack,
that doesn't explode?

01:39:06.899 --> 01:39:10.360
It is a cheap gold watch, buddy.

01:39:11.528 --> 01:39:15.949
You're crazy. You're fucking crazy.

01:39:15.950 --> 01:39:19.202
No. Poor people are crazy, Jack.

01:39:19.203 --> 01:39:21.996
I'm eccentric. Get the money. Let's go.

01:39:21.997 --> 01:39:24.707
Come on! Let's go! Move it! Move it!

01:39:24.708 --> 01:39:27.085
You stay! Move it! Move it!

01:39:27.086 --> 01:39:29.587
In the door. In that door! Now!

01:39:31.507 --> 01:39:34.467
Bye, Jack. Punk.

01:39:38.514 --> 01:39:39.722
All right!

01:39:41.558 --> 01:39:45.186
Get in there. Go on, get in.

01:39:45.187 --> 01:39:48.898
You get back in there!
You get this train moving! Go on!

01:39:49.775 --> 01:39:52.527
Are these seats taken?

01:39:52.528 --> 01:39:53.861
No. Go.

01:39:57.032 --> 01:40:00.451
Come on. Back over here.
Hands around the pole.

01:40:21.557 --> 01:40:23.599
Damn.

01:40:42.161 --> 01:40:44.120
Come on, come on, come on!

01:40:50.044 --> 01:40:53.254
PIease report, Westbound 501.
What is your position?

01:40:58.135 --> 01:41:01.137
Westbound 501, please check in.

01:41:01.138 --> 01:41:08.603
Westbound 501. We have poIice orders
to return to the station. Do you copy?

01:41:08.604 --> 01:41:13.107
You have to hold this. It's like a grenade.
You have to help me now. Come on, hold it.

01:41:13.108 --> 01:41:16.778
Don't let it go. Huh? I'm counting on you.

01:41:16.779 --> 01:41:18.279
Do you copy?

01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:20.698
Hey! I'll take it from here.

01:41:32.711 --> 01:41:37.215
Maybe you'd better let me have this after all.
I'm afraid you're a bit hysterical

01:41:37.216 --> 01:41:39.717
and you might let this go a mite early.

01:41:42.888 --> 01:41:45.973
Hey! Hey, buckaroo!

01:41:45.974 --> 01:41:48.476
It's not cos you're a woman, all right?

01:41:48.477 --> 01:41:52.897
Hey, it's all right. Looks like we're all alone.

01:41:52.898 --> 01:41:58.486
You won. You beat Jack. You beat everybody.
Just throw me off the train. I don't care.

01:41:58.487 --> 01:42:01.864
This stick works on a remote.

01:42:01.865 --> 01:42:06.202
When you explode, that's where they'll come,
but it's not where I'll be.

01:42:06.203 --> 01:42:12.333
I have a different plan. Mess like that,
they don't even count body parts.

01:42:12.334 --> 01:42:15.586
Gives me more time.

01:42:15.587 --> 01:42:18.089
It's not gonna hurt, Annie.

01:42:31.103 --> 01:42:33.604
Hey, Jack, is that you?

01:42:35.691 --> 01:42:39.193
He's so persistent. He always gets his man.

01:42:39.194 --> 01:42:43.114
Wouldn't be able
to interest you in a bribe, would I?

01:42:43.115 --> 01:42:46.659
I've got plenty to go around.

01:42:50.664 --> 01:42:52.498
My money!

01:42:57.546 --> 01:43:00.923
You bastard! How does that feel?

01:43:02.843 --> 01:43:06.512
You like that, huh? You like it, you bastard?

01:43:10.851 --> 01:43:12.852
My money!

01:43:19.818 --> 01:43:21.485
Shit!

01:43:21.486 --> 01:43:24.739
You! I'm coming for you, Jack!

01:43:54.436 --> 01:43:57.563
Hey, I'll drop the stick, boy. You want that?

01:43:58.899 --> 01:44:01.609
I'm gonna get you.

01:44:01.610 --> 01:44:02.902
Oh, yes!

01:44:16.250 --> 01:44:20.586
What do you do, Jack? What do you do?
You're so smart, right, Jack?

01:44:20.587 --> 01:44:25.967
You piece of shit! I'm the guy
with the plan cos I'm smarter than you.

01:44:25.968 --> 01:44:28.052
I'm smarter than you.

01:44:41.942 --> 01:44:43.401
Yeah.

01:44:44.820 --> 01:44:46.612
But I'm taller.

01:44:48.407 --> 01:44:49.615
Jack.

01:44:50.492 --> 01:44:51.617
Jack!

01:44:51.618 --> 01:44:54.328
Oh, God! I thought you were dead. Jack.

01:44:56.957 --> 01:45:00.001
- Turn around.
- Where's Payne?

01:45:00.002 --> 01:45:02.586
He lost his head.

01:45:04.006 --> 01:45:06.507
Oh, God.

01:45:06.508 --> 01:45:10.511
- Let's take this off, shall we?
- Yes. Let's take this off.

01:45:13.348 --> 01:45:16.892
- Take it off.
- HeIlo? HelIo?

01:45:16.893 --> 01:45:21.188
Does anyone copy?
Jack, this is Mac. Can you hear me?

01:45:22.774 --> 01:45:27.987
Jack, if you're there, you've got to stop
the train. The track isn't finished.

01:45:27.988 --> 01:45:31.449
Mac, I copy.

01:45:31.450 --> 01:45:33.909
- Mac.
- If someone can hear me...

01:45:33.910 --> 01:45:39.206
- Mac, can you hear me?
- Try the emergency brake. Do you copy?

01:45:41.418 --> 01:45:44.795
Nothing works! Annie, you won't believe this.

01:45:44.796 --> 01:45:47.006
What?

01:45:47.007 --> 01:45:49.133
We have to jump.

01:45:49.134 --> 01:45:51.177
You can't stop it?

01:45:53.764 --> 01:45:58.351
Well, OK, undo me,
and I'd love to go with you. Come on.

01:46:00.020 --> 01:46:02.229
- I don't have a key.
- What?

01:46:02.230 --> 01:46:04.357
I don't have the key.

01:46:25.379 --> 01:46:26.504
Shit.

01:46:44.022 --> 01:46:46.899
You gotta get off... You gotta get off the train.

01:46:46.900 --> 01:46:51.362
Jack, please! This track dead-ends.
You gotta get off this train. This is crazy.

01:46:51.363 --> 01:46:53.656
There's a curve ahead.

01:46:53.657 --> 01:46:57.326
I'm gonna speed it up, make it jump the track.

01:46:57.327 --> 01:47:01.288
This is really stupid.
Jack, please. You can still jump.

01:47:01.289 --> 01:47:04.375
Jack, please. Please, Jack?

01:49:44.828 --> 01:49:49.456
I can't believe he hit my van.
Come on. It's all right.

01:49:49.457 --> 01:49:50.416
Unreal.

01:49:53.211 --> 01:49:55.462
You didn't leave me.

01:49:55.463 --> 01:49:58.132
I can't believe it.

01:49:59.884 --> 01:50:02.511
You didn't leave me.

01:50:02.512 --> 01:50:04.847
Didn't have anywhere to be just then.

01:50:10.979 --> 01:50:13.063
Check it out.

01:50:18.695 --> 01:50:21.238
I have to warn you.

01:50:21.239 --> 01:50:25.618
I've heard relationships
based on intense experiences never work.

01:50:25.619 --> 01:50:28.078
OK.

01:50:28.079 --> 01:50:31.123
We'll have to base it on sex, then.

01:50:31.124 --> 01:50:33.626
Whatever you say, ma'am.
