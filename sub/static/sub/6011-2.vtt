00:34.320 --> 00:35.435
Oh, heavens.

00:35.800 --> 00:37.119
This is nice.

00:37.200 --> 00:39.111
It's from Gwen. She's married.

00:39.480 --> 00:41.550
- Who's Gwen?
- She used to work as a housemaid here.

00:41.640 --> 00:42.675
She left to be a secretary.

00:44.280 --> 00:46.236
That's her ladyship for you, Miss Braithwaite.

00:47.640 --> 00:50.632
She says they kept it
very quiet because his mother's ill,

00:50.840 --> 00:53.912
but she hopes she can introduce us
to him in due course.

00:54.080 --> 00:56.469
Well, I think it's lovely.
We should send her a card.

00:56.560 --> 00:58.357
I'll get one and we can all sign it.

00:59.600 --> 01:01.670
Sorry. I nearly forgot this.

01:01.760 --> 01:03.910
No harm done. How are you finding it?

01:04.000 --> 01:06.355
Have that lot got used
to your promotion, yet?

01:06.600 --> 01:07.589
Some of them.

01:07.960 --> 01:09.029
But not all, eh?

01:09.640 --> 01:12.393
I'll be fine.
I don't need to have everyone love me.

01:12.720 --> 01:14.870
Nor me.
 Which is just as well.

01:18.960 --> 01:20.393
Miss Braithwaite?

01:21.200 --> 01:23.634
I hope you don't mind,
but can I give you some advice?

01:24.040 --> 01:25.029
Go on.

01:25.440 --> 01:29.399
Mr Barrow never bothered with you
when you were a housemaid, but he will now.

01:29.720 --> 01:31.039
I should be friendly,

01:31.120 --> 01:33.270
but keep him at arm's length if I were you.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.274
I'd better get on.

01:42.320 --> 01:43.309
What do you think's in it?

01:43.720 --> 01:45.392
I cannot say, James.

01:45.480 --> 01:49.155
It's addressed to Lady Mary,
so perhaps you could question her later?

01:50.680 --> 01:51.999
Mr Carson?

01:55.400 --> 01:59.075
You see the box has been delivered
from the late Mr Crawley's office?

01:59.160 --> 02:00.149
Yes.

02:00.240 --> 02:02.037
Well, ought we to give it
straight to Lady Mary?

02:02.120 --> 02:04.076
Shouldn't someone else see it first?

02:04.840 --> 02:06.990
In case there's something
in it to make her cry.

02:07.560 --> 02:09.675
You may be right.
I'll take it to his lordship

02:09.759 --> 02:11.398
and he can decide.

02:24.520 --> 02:27.830
I say. Phyllis Dare's coming
to the Theatre Royal in York.

02:27.920 --> 02:29.956
"Miss Dare will appear
in <i>The Lady of the Rose,</i>

02:30.040 --> 02:32.031
"which was a hit musical
of the London Season."

02:32.520 --> 02:33.999
Who's Phyllis Dare?

02:34.080 --> 02:36.469
Only one of the Dare sisters.

02:36.560 --> 02:39.233
Zena and Phyllis Dare, up here in York.

02:39.320 --> 02:40.878
What happened to the other one?

02:40.960 --> 02:42.598
She married the son of Lord Esher,
then retired.

02:42.680 --> 02:44.193
Oh, all right for some.

02:44.280 --> 02:45.599
Have you truly never heard of them?

02:45.680 --> 02:46.669
Why would I?

02:46.760 --> 02:47.954
I don't go to the theatre.

02:48.120 --> 02:49.269
You must have been sometimes.

02:49.560 --> 02:51.073
No. I've never been.

02:51.200 --> 02:54.112
She's got better things
to spend her money on.

02:58.280 --> 02:59.759
I don't understand you.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.158
Of course you must give it to her.

03:02.360 --> 03:04.669
But what if it has no legal status?

03:04.760 --> 03:07.274
I don't want to build her hopes up,
only to have them dashed.

03:07.840 --> 03:12.516
Robert, Matthew intended Mary
to be his sole heiress.

03:12.600 --> 03:16.149
That will mean a great deal to her,
whether or not it's legal.

03:16.600 --> 03:17.749
Can't you see that?

03:17.840 --> 03:19.478
But is it right to exclude George?

03:19.840 --> 03:22.718
Well, right or not, it is what he wanted.

03:23.640 --> 03:25.437
Besides, it's not up to you.

03:30.840 --> 03:31.909
I'll send it to Murray.

03:32.240 --> 03:35.232
Well, Mary must read it
before you send it anywhere.

03:36.360 --> 03:38.476
Or are you trying to hide from the truth?

03:39.440 --> 03:40.429
What truth?

03:40.520 --> 03:44.308
That you would prefer
to be in sole charge of the estate

03:44.400 --> 03:46.755
and not share the crown with Mary.

03:46.880 --> 03:49.952
Don't be silly.
This won't make any difference to all that.

03:50.040 --> 03:51.678
She won't want to get involved.

03:52.120 --> 03:55.351
When you talk like that,
I'm tempted to ring for Nanny

03:55.560 --> 03:58.393
and have you put to bed with no supper.

04:02.480 --> 04:03.549
Goodbye, Mr Grigg.

04:03.640 --> 04:04.993
Thank you, Doctor.

04:06.240 --> 04:09.835
All he needs to put him right
is some paid work.

04:09.920 --> 04:13.276
It's hard for a healthy young man
to find a job these days,

04:13.360 --> 04:15.316
never mind poor old Mr Grigg.

04:15.400 --> 04:17.072
I know. Thank you.

04:17.519 --> 04:19.988
But Mrs Crawley has things in hand.

04:20.320 --> 04:22.834
My guess is
you knew what you were doing,

04:22.920 --> 04:23.955
bringing him here.

04:24.040 --> 04:25.712
Mrs Hughes?

04:25.800 --> 04:27.074
Won't you come up?

04:30.920 --> 04:32.751
Oh, don't get up for me.

04:33.160 --> 04:34.593
What news of Charlie?

04:35.280 --> 04:37.077
Mr Carson is still very busy,

04:38.200 --> 04:40.236
but he sends his best wishes.

04:41.360 --> 04:42.759
Does he?

04:43.480 --> 04:45.357
How did he phrase that, exactly?

04:46.560 --> 04:48.835
Well, he, he said to tell you...

04:48.960 --> 04:50.473
He didn't say nothing, did he?

04:53.200 --> 04:55.236
You have to understand,

04:55.320 --> 04:59.871
he doesn't remember the days
you spent together with any great nostalgia.

05:01.120 --> 05:02.758
He thinks it were all my fault.

05:04.240 --> 05:05.309
But it weren't.

05:05.480 --> 05:06.629
Meaning what?

05:07.360 --> 05:08.349
Never mind.

05:09.640 --> 05:11.153
But it weren't my fault.

05:13.440 --> 05:16.716
They're all coming tonight, so we have
to stretch a dinner by two places.

05:16.800 --> 05:17.915
Why, suddenly?

05:18.040 --> 05:20.076
I don't know, do I? Go on about Jimmy.

05:20.240 --> 05:22.913
I just want Ivy to know
he's not interested in her.

05:23.400 --> 05:25.311
He pretends he is
because he knows it annoys me.

05:25.400 --> 05:26.674
How can you be sure?

05:26.760 --> 05:28.910
Well, he hasn't been bothered
about her before now, has he?

05:29.200 --> 05:30.599
Sometimes people come round.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.115
You hope.

05:32.320 --> 05:35.278
I thought the fish-seller
might be in the village, but he's not coming.

05:35.880 --> 05:37.950
I'll have to go to Tuttles in York.

05:38.040 --> 05:39.029
I can do it.

05:39.560 --> 05:40.709
- What?
- Go to York.

05:41.320 --> 05:42.912
You can tell Mr Carson
I'm there on your business.

05:43.040 --> 05:44.393
We don't know he can spare you.

05:44.600 --> 05:45.589
He will if you ask him.

05:58.720 --> 05:59.948
Hello, Mr Molesley.

06:03.080 --> 06:04.229
How are things?

06:04.640 --> 06:06.198
Well, as you can see, not very good.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.709
I don't agree. It's skilled work.

06:08.880 --> 06:10.598
No, it isn't. Not what I'm doing.

06:11.080 --> 06:13.878
I'm sure, if you just wait,
something better will turn up.

06:13.960 --> 06:16.599
I have waited and nothing's turned up.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.952
I haven't earned a penny
since Mr Crawley died,

06:19.040 --> 06:20.598
and now I owe money all over the village.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.477
- Yes, but surely with your...
- Don't you understand?

06:23.560 --> 06:24.993
I'm at my wits' end!

06:27.120 --> 06:28.951
I apologize. I should not have said that.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.349
It was vulgar and self-important.

06:31.440 --> 06:33.032
Please forgive me.

06:37.320 --> 06:38.435
How much do you owe?

06:40.920 --> 06:43.798
What difference does it make?
Fifteen, twenty pounds.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.588
More than I've any likelihood of.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.115
Mr Molesley,

06:49.040 --> 06:53.158
would it be useful
if Mr Bates and I lent you some money?

06:54.280 --> 06:55.793
When would I pay it back?

06:56.960 --> 06:58.075
Give it, then.

06:58.160 --> 06:59.479
We'll give you some, if you like.

07:00.480 --> 07:01.913
Not much, but, but some.

07:02.560 --> 07:04.073
I couldn't accept that.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.078
But I thank you. I do.

07:07.600 --> 07:08.715
Most sincerely.

07:08.840 --> 07:10.034
Get back to work!

07:18.440 --> 07:20.351
Anna said you wanted
to see me before I go down.

07:20.480 --> 07:22.311
Yes. That is...

07:22.720 --> 07:24.551
Thank you, Bates. That will be all.

07:30.720 --> 07:33.393
You know I've invited Granny
and Isobel to dinner?

07:33.760 --> 07:34.795
I didn't, but...

07:35.160 --> 07:36.832
Well, the thing is...

07:38.720 --> 07:41.154
There is a letter for you. From Matthew.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.115
What?

07:44.040 --> 07:45.189
Where was it?

07:45.280 --> 07:48.192
Hidden in a book in the office,
and so it was overlooked.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.791
They finally got round
to packing up his things

07:52.240 --> 07:54.037
and brought them here this morning.

08:00.320 --> 08:01.912
Who opened it?

08:02.000 --> 08:03.718
It wasn't sealed.

08:03.800 --> 08:06.155
- But you've read it? Before me?
- Yes.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.590
In fact, I would have sent it
to Murray to have it looked into,

08:08.680 --> 08:11.114
but your grandmother insisted
you should see it first.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.077
Granny's read it, too?

08:13.600 --> 08:15.192
And what do you mean,
"To have it looked into"?

08:15.280 --> 08:16.554
Read it.

08:16.640 --> 08:17.868
Then you'll understand.

08:27.480 --> 08:29.436
I felt so sorry for him.

08:30.080 --> 08:33.152
To be in debt like that is the worst thing.

08:33.240 --> 08:34.798
Molesley's not having much luck.

08:34.880 --> 08:37.758
But if he won't accept help, then...

08:38.320 --> 08:39.753
I don't know.

08:41.159 --> 08:42.479
I'm really upset by it.

08:43.159 --> 08:44.229
Well, we can't have that.

08:47.400 --> 08:48.549
I don't understand.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.916
Did Matthew leave instructions after all?

08:51.080 --> 08:52.149
He left a letter.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.310
He wrote it before we went to Scotland.

08:55.600 --> 08:56.669
Well, where has it been?

08:56.760 --> 08:57.875
Concealed in a book.

08:58.240 --> 08:59.992
They only dropped it off today.

09:04.680 --> 09:06.352
Papa, you read it.

09:11.240 --> 09:13.629
"My darling Mary,
we are off to Duneagle in the morning

09:13.720 --> 09:16.154
"and I have suddenly realized
that I've never made a will

09:16.280 --> 09:19.317
"or anything like one,
which seems pretty feeble for a lawyer,

09:19.440 --> 09:22.432
"and you being pregnant
makes it even more irresponsible."

09:22.520 --> 09:24.875
Hmm, I'm afraid I have to agree with that.

09:25.160 --> 09:29.039
"I'll do it properly when I get back
and tear this up before you ever see it.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.955
"But I'll feel easier that I've recorded,
on paper,

09:32.040 --> 09:35.476
"that I wish you to be my sole heiress."

09:35.800 --> 09:36.789
What?

09:36.880 --> 09:39.838
"I cannot know if our baby is a boy or a girl,

09:39.920 --> 09:41.831
"but I do know it will be a baby

09:41.920 --> 09:45.037
"if anything happens to me
before I've drawn up a will,

09:45.120 --> 09:47.076
"and so you must take charge.

09:48.960 --> 09:53.317
"And now I shall sign this
and get off home for dinner with you.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.790
"What a lovely, lovely thought.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.352
"Matthew."

10:00.720 --> 10:02.915
Now you see why I didn't want to read it.

10:03.960 --> 10:05.757
But surely it must be legal.

10:05.880 --> 10:07.199
Or do there have to be witnesses?

10:07.280 --> 10:08.713
But it was witnessed.

10:08.840 --> 10:09.955
By two of his clients,

10:10.040 --> 10:12.110
which is why no one in the office
knew it existed.

10:12.200 --> 10:13.189
Then it's settled.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.438
Nothing is settled.

10:16.440 --> 10:20.115
This is why I wanted Murray to check it first.

10:21.480 --> 10:23.118
Whatever Matthew's intentions,

10:23.680 --> 10:25.113
it is not a will.

10:28.160 --> 10:31.516
I've explained to Mr Carson about the fish
and he says you can go.

10:31.600 --> 10:32.635
Thanks.

10:35.600 --> 10:37.591
A pound to a penny
he's got some trick up his sleeve.

10:37.680 --> 10:38.999
You're so suspicious.

10:39.080 --> 10:41.548
There are two reasons
why he's being so nice to Ivy.

10:41.640 --> 10:45.189
The first is to make me angry,
and I dread to think about the second.

10:45.560 --> 10:49.838
And I have my reason for getting that
to the dining room before midnight.

10:52.320 --> 10:54.550
I don't exactly know why,
but I feel very happy

10:54.640 --> 10:56.949
that Matthew's been allowed a last word.

10:57.040 --> 10:58.268
I agree.

10:58.440 --> 10:59.555
More than I can say.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.389
I knew he'd have a sensible plan.

11:02.880 --> 11:05.075
I'm not sure how sensible it is.

11:05.160 --> 11:07.116
If the letter is valid,
the estate will have to pay

11:07.200 --> 11:09.794
death duties twice
before it reaches little George.

11:10.560 --> 11:14.997
But in the meantime it will have
all the benefit of Mary's interest.

11:15.440 --> 11:17.158
I hope you intend to get stuck in.

11:17.240 --> 11:19.037
I want the right to an opinion.

11:19.120 --> 11:20.633
I shall be content with that.

11:20.720 --> 11:22.631
You already have the right to an opinion.

11:22.920 --> 11:24.717
Do I? Good.

11:24.960 --> 11:26.075
Certainly you do.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.238
In fact, there's a question of using

11:28.320 --> 11:30.117
empty farmyards as new sources of revenue.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.350
I'd like to know what you feel about that?

11:32.440 --> 11:34.317
- Well, I'd have to think about it...
- Crop rotation?

11:34.560 --> 11:35.834
Livestock versus cereals?

11:35.920 --> 11:37.638
Or indeed, the whole matter of the tax.

11:37.720 --> 11:40.439
There are lots of things
I would like your opinion on.

11:41.960 --> 11:44.554
I assume you're trying
to make some sort of point.

11:44.680 --> 11:46.955
He's trying to show
that a woman's place is in the home.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.076
But she knows a lot about Matthew's plans.

11:49.400 --> 11:51.311
That has value for me.

11:51.400 --> 11:53.277
Mrs Crawley? W hat do you think?

11:53.560 --> 11:56.996
I'm afraid I'm on Mary's side, Robert,
if sides there must be.

11:57.160 --> 11:58.832
There are no sides. Not at all.

11:58.920 --> 12:00.353
I'm pleased if you're pleased.

12:00.440 --> 12:02.874
I'm just saying you have some work to do.

12:03.120 --> 12:05.509
That is, if the letter turns out to be valid.

12:06.280 --> 12:08.589
Which you very much hope it is not.

12:13.040 --> 12:14.871
What's the matter with you?

12:15.000 --> 12:16.956
I'm a stupid fool, that's what.

12:17.080 --> 12:19.355
Oh, lordy. How did you manage that?

12:21.280 --> 12:22.599
Daydreaming.

12:22.680 --> 12:24.557
I don't know what I was about.

12:24.680 --> 12:26.193
She'll be livid.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.476
Not if you do as I tell you. Come on.

12:31.080 --> 12:33.196
By the way, did you get that card for Gwen?

12:33.280 --> 12:34.759
Yes. Why?

12:34.840 --> 12:37.115
I thought it'd be nice
for people in the village to sign it.

12:38.160 --> 12:41.755
The Bakewells, Mr Molesley, that sort of thing.

12:42.280 --> 12:43.872
I'll collect them.

12:43.960 --> 12:45.791
- You surprise me.
- Why?

12:46.720 --> 12:49.075
I never think of you as social.

12:49.160 --> 12:52.357
Why should I be social, when I have you?

12:54.520 --> 12:57.034
You wrote to the Opera House in Belfast?

12:57.720 --> 12:58.835
That was enterprising.

12:58.920 --> 13:01.388
I wrote to a great many theatres,

13:01.640 --> 13:04.313
but the manager at the Opera House
wrote back.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.391
It seems they're in need
of a stage-door keeper.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.909
They'd chosen one, but he dropped out.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.195
He asks Mr Grigg to consider it.

13:15.040 --> 13:17.634
I heard about Mr Matthew's letter.

13:18.240 --> 13:20.549
I hope it wasn't too upsetting.

13:22.080 --> 13:24.036
As a matter of fact, it was a relief.

13:26.280 --> 13:29.511
I felt so happy that he'd finally been heard.

13:30.760 --> 13:32.876
But judging by tonight's dinner,

13:32.960 --> 13:35.349
it may prove a heavy mantle for Lady Mary.

13:42.920 --> 13:44.592
I shall keep it on my dressing table.

13:45.480 --> 13:47.789
To remind me that Matthew is on my side.

13:49.240 --> 13:50.355
They're all on your side.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.031
Papa gave me such a whacking at dinner.

13:55.080 --> 13:57.435
Your father loves you very much.

14:00.400 --> 14:03.756
He's also very glad to have Downton
back under his control.

14:05.160 --> 14:08.516
He always speaks highly of Mr Matthew
and the changes he made.

14:09.280 --> 14:11.430
I'm sure he's very genuine.

14:11.880 --> 14:13.996
But he thinks he can manage alone now.

14:14.680 --> 14:16.716
And the question is, can he?

14:25.680 --> 14:27.671
You wanted to borrow a belt, m'lady.

14:27.760 --> 14:30.149
Lady Mary wondered
if any of these might suit.

14:30.240 --> 14:31.719
Thank you.

14:31.840 --> 14:35.037
Actually, I'm glad that you're here
as there's something I want to ask.

14:39.120 --> 14:42.237
Look what I found in the village today.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.597
Don't you think it would be
the most terrific fun?

14:45.680 --> 14:47.193
Have you asked her ladyship?

14:47.640 --> 14:49.073
She'd never let me go.

14:49.160 --> 14:50.832
At least, not without a chaperone,

14:50.920 --> 14:54.469
but Lady Edith will be in London
and Lady Mary's not in the mood.

14:55.040 --> 14:56.359
But is this quite suitable?

14:56.440 --> 14:59.113
It looks more like something
for servants and farm-workers to me.

14:59.520 --> 15:00.555
So?

15:00.920 --> 15:02.911
They'll dance the one-step, won't they?

15:03.000 --> 15:06.276
I've practised and practised
and I'm dying to try it.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.199
Won't you accompany me?

15:09.600 --> 15:12.990
Then if we're found out, I can say
that you came with me, so nothing was amiss.

15:13.920 --> 15:15.638
Of course I can't, m'lady.

15:15.720 --> 15:17.233
Not without asking Lady Mary.

15:17.920 --> 15:19.433
But that would spoil everything.

15:19.520 --> 15:21.795
She'd be bound to tell Lady Grantham.

15:22.280 --> 15:23.474
Please.

15:24.080 --> 15:26.116
I know you love dancing

15:26.640 --> 15:29.598
and Mr Bates may have many qualities,
but he's not a dancer.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.712
No, m'lady. He isn't a dancer.

15:32.880 --> 15:35.633
But I'm afraid it's quite impossible.

15:39.240 --> 15:40.468
But how did it happen?

15:40.920 --> 15:42.638
I don't like to say, m'lady.

15:42.720 --> 15:43.709
I'm truly vexed.

15:44.240 --> 15:45.229
It was a favourite.

15:45.320 --> 15:47.038
I know, m'lady, and I'm very sorry.

15:47.360 --> 15:48.839
But you won't tell me how you did it?

15:49.880 --> 15:50.869
I can't.

15:51.720 --> 15:54.188
Very well, Braithwaite.
I suppose you'd better look me out another.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.028
What are you doing?

16:13.120 --> 16:17.079
I'm just sorting some old papers.
I haven't looked at these in years.

16:17.160 --> 16:18.752
Why are you looking now?

16:18.840 --> 16:20.159
No particular reason.

16:20.560 --> 16:21.549
Ah!

16:22.720 --> 16:24.756
I knew I hadn't thrown it away.

16:25.120 --> 16:28.112
- Who was she?
- Just a friend at one time.

16:30.120 --> 16:31.394
What was she called?

16:32.160 --> 16:33.309
Alice.

16:33.400 --> 16:34.753
Alice Neal.

16:35.360 --> 16:37.032
And you were fond of her?

16:37.440 --> 16:38.589
I was.

16:38.880 --> 16:41.553
But people drift in and out of your life,
don't they?

16:43.880 --> 16:46.110
Truth to tell, I felt she'd treated me badly.

16:47.520 --> 16:49.351
What does it matter, anyway?

16:49.480 --> 16:52.950
We shout and scream and wail and cry,
but in the end we must all die.

16:54.920 --> 16:56.990
Well, that's cheered me up.

16:57.760 --> 16:58.795
Thank you.

16:59.040 --> 17:00.553
Now I'll get on with my work.

17:04.480 --> 17:06.435
Your ladyship, Mr Bates.

17:08.760 --> 17:10.352
Bates?

17:10.960 --> 17:13.520
I'm very sorry to interrupt you
when you're busy, m'lady.

17:13.960 --> 17:16.473
It concerns Mr Molesley, the younger.

17:16.560 --> 17:18.596
You make him sound like
a Greek philosopher.

17:19.200 --> 17:23.876
He has fallen on hard times, and I know
that you have helped him in the past.

17:26.040 --> 17:28.348
Are you asking me to give him some money?

17:28.600 --> 17:29.794
I am asking for money, yes.

17:30.840 --> 17:33.308
Although he's too proud to accept it as a gift.

17:33.880 --> 17:35.233
Oh, how refreshing.

17:35.640 --> 17:37.039
Although I think we can find a way.

17:39.400 --> 17:40.799
Morning, Barrow.

17:41.720 --> 17:43.472
Good morning, m'lady.

17:44.200 --> 17:46.270
Is his lordship in the library?

17:46.360 --> 17:48.157
He is. But, um...

17:48.840 --> 17:49.829
What is it?

17:51.400 --> 17:52.833
Miss Braithwaite is very unhappy.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.555
With good reason.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.434
Yes, but you see, er,

17:59.160 --> 18:01.628
she couldn't explain
how it happened because,

18:01.720 --> 18:03.153
well, she didn't want to point the finger.

18:03.520 --> 18:04.953
Point the finger at whom?

18:05.360 --> 18:07.351
Well, that's just it, m'lady.

18:07.440 --> 18:08.919
I dare not, either.

18:09.280 --> 18:11.316
I'm in enough trouble with Mr Bates as it is.

18:11.400 --> 18:13.197
You're not saying Bates is to blame?

18:13.440 --> 18:15.078
Not Mr Bates, himself, no.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.875
Anna, then?
But why would she do such a thing?

18:18.520 --> 18:20.670
As to that, m'lady, who knows?

18:20.760 --> 18:21.954
Perhaps it was an accident.

18:22.400 --> 18:25.153
Though they do say there's no one
so jealous as a lady's maid.

18:25.360 --> 18:26.793
Cora, is that you?

18:28.520 --> 18:29.589
Could I ask you something?

18:33.880 --> 18:36.155
- Where's my scent?
- Here you are, m'lady.

18:39.880 --> 18:41.359
- Oh!
- How stupid of me.

18:41.640 --> 18:42.709
That was my clumsiness.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.870
No, it was me. Damn.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.594
Now the room's going to smell
like tart's boudoir.

18:47.840 --> 18:49.876
I'll clean it up.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.068
Is it all gone?

18:53.160 --> 18:54.718
I'm afraid so.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.392
It means a trip to Mr Roberts.

18:56.480 --> 18:58.152
There's no one nearer who sells it here.

18:58.360 --> 19:00.271
It's only York. I could go, if you like.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.028
In fact...

19:03.480 --> 19:04.708
What?

19:05.040 --> 19:09.158
Lady Rose asked me if I'd chaperone her
to a <i>thé dansant</i> in York today.

19:09.720 --> 19:11.915
She didn't want to ask her ladyship,

19:12.000 --> 19:14.116
but she thought she'd get away with it
if I went with her.

19:14.440 --> 19:15.429
And what did you say?

19:15.880 --> 19:17.518
That I couldn't go without your permission.

19:18.840 --> 19:21.957
Well, it is rather slow here for a girl her age.

19:23.440 --> 19:25.874
Go. But make sure
you keep her out of trouble.

19:30.120 --> 19:31.269
Go on.

19:31.960 --> 19:33.473
I know Gwen'd appreciate it.

19:34.360 --> 19:35.509
I don't see why.

19:35.640 --> 19:36.709
I didn't know her that well.

19:37.160 --> 19:38.639
But you can sign it, surely.

19:43.760 --> 19:45.512
And why don't you come over tonight?

19:45.600 --> 19:47.272
We haven't seen you in a while.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.228
You're being very friendly.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.239
Aren't I usually friendly?

19:51.320 --> 19:52.355
No.

19:52.480 --> 19:55.916
I mean, you're not discourteous,
Mr Bates, I'll give you that.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.036
But you're not friendly.

19:58.680 --> 20:00.193
Except to Anna, of course.

20:02.040 --> 20:03.598
Well, I shall try to do better in future.

20:05.480 --> 20:06.549
See you tonight.

20:11.080 --> 20:12.593
Mr Branson, your ladyship.

20:12.680 --> 20:14.238
Sorry if I'm late.

20:14.320 --> 20:16.151
I had to call on old Fairclough at Roundhills.

20:16.360 --> 20:17.429
You're not at all late.

20:17.840 --> 20:20.070
Now, I asked Branson to come here

20:20.480 --> 20:22.072
because I have an idea.

20:22.240 --> 20:24.231
Granny, you must call him Tom.

20:24.320 --> 20:27.312
I thought I could call him Branson again,
now that he's the agent.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.118
- Well, you can't.
- I don't mind.

20:29.200 --> 20:31.270
No, I see I'm beaten.

20:31.360 --> 20:34.670
But, oh, how I sympathise with King Canute.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.319
Now, what is this idea?

20:36.720 --> 20:40.395
Well, Mary, either you, or your baby son,

20:41.360 --> 20:43.316
own half of Downton.

20:44.080 --> 20:46.435
I want you to have a say in the running of it.

20:47.720 --> 20:49.392
It's just what you need.

20:49.480 --> 20:52.438
But didn't last night's dinner
disabuse you of that scheme?

20:52.520 --> 20:53.748
Yes, well, that's the point.

20:53.840 --> 20:55.114
I want, er...

20:55.560 --> 20:56.595
Tom.

20:56.680 --> 20:59.148
"Tom" to be your instructor.

20:59.960 --> 21:01.075
What?

21:01.320 --> 21:03.834
Well, take Mary, you know, on your rounds.

21:04.120 --> 21:06.953
Let her learn the farmers' difficulties.

21:08.240 --> 21:10.435
Hmm... Explain...

21:11.200 --> 21:12.189
the crops.

21:13.320 --> 21:15.038
And the live... the livestock.

21:15.960 --> 21:19.236
You know, let her see
the problems facing the estate.

21:19.520 --> 21:22.080
And are we to do all this
without telling Papa?

21:22.600 --> 21:24.192
Isn't that rather underhand?

21:24.920 --> 21:28.117
There can be too much truth
in any relationship.

21:31.880 --> 21:32.915
Mrs Crawley.

21:38.160 --> 21:39.593
We weren't expecting you.

21:40.120 --> 21:42.236
Her ladyship is lunching with Lady Ingram,

21:42.320 --> 21:43.833
his lordship is walking,

21:43.920 --> 21:46.832
Lady Mary's at the Dower House
and Lady Edith is in London.

21:46.920 --> 21:49.878
As a matter of fact, it's you I came to see.

21:50.680 --> 21:52.159
To talk about Charles Grigg.

21:52.760 --> 21:53.749
You know he's got a job

21:54.360 --> 21:56.157
at the Opera House in Belfast?

21:58.240 --> 22:00.800
He's so anxious to talk to you
before he goes.

22:00.880 --> 22:02.791
Then he is in for a disappointment.

22:03.560 --> 22:06.199
He says he's resolved
to put his dishonesty behind him.

22:06.720 --> 22:08.039
Is he, now?

22:09.360 --> 22:10.839
I know it's more than that.

22:12.240 --> 22:14.117
He told me he caused you great unhappiness,

22:14.200 --> 22:15.952
but he said it was not his fault.

22:16.720 --> 22:18.517
He was always a liar.

22:20.200 --> 22:21.349
I see.

22:25.400 --> 22:28.597
It seems a pity
not to take the chance to end a quarrel.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.352
Isn't it better than to let things fester?

22:30.440 --> 22:32.590
I don't mean to speak out of turn,
Mrs Crawley,

22:32.680 --> 22:34.113
but you will, I think, accept

22:34.200 --> 22:37.636
that any difference between
Mr Grigg and me is my concern.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.592
Of course it is.

22:41.600 --> 22:42.919
I'm sorry.

22:49.120 --> 22:51.190
Thank you, Carson.

22:51.880 --> 22:52.869
Good day.

23:02.120 --> 23:03.678
Shall I make us some coffee?

23:04.240 --> 23:05.593
You are so domesticated.

23:05.720 --> 23:07.199
No, not really.

23:07.720 --> 23:10.712
Monk just lays it all out.
I only have to pour in the water.

23:10.920 --> 23:13.434
I mean it.
Compared to Papa, you're a famous chef.

23:13.520 --> 23:14.714
Really.

23:14.800 --> 23:16.313
He can't boil a kettle.

23:16.960 --> 23:19.872
If the servants left,
he'd be found in a passage,

23:19.960 --> 23:22.554
dead, arms stretched out,
looking for the kitchen.

23:22.640 --> 23:24.198
Well, I hope you can boil a kettle.

23:24.280 --> 23:27.590
Life with me
won't be quite what you're used to.

23:29.280 --> 23:31.191
How are things going?

23:31.280 --> 23:32.633
Uh, well.

23:33.240 --> 23:35.071
At least, my lawyer thinks so.

23:35.200 --> 23:36.633
Are you sure about this?

23:36.720 --> 23:38.676
The Royal Family convulses the nation

23:38.760 --> 23:40.113
by ceasing to be German,

23:40.200 --> 23:41.952
and you want to take it up.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.833
Does it matter that people will hate you for it?

23:46.800 --> 23:47.835
Will you hate me?

23:48.320 --> 23:49.833
I will love you more than ever.

23:49.920 --> 23:52.992
That's all right, then.
I'm pretty tough.

23:53.720 --> 23:55.312
I may not be used
to the splendours of Downton,

23:55.400 --> 23:57.231
but I do know how to look after myself.

23:57.320 --> 23:59.436
Would you like to see Downton?

23:59.960 --> 24:00.949
Where did that come from?

24:01.520 --> 24:06.275
Well, I was thinking,
if you are nearly German and nearly divorced,

24:06.360 --> 24:08.590
perhaps the family should know you a bit.

24:10.280 --> 24:12.748
It won't be settled tomorrow, my darling.
I can't pretend it will.

24:12.880 --> 24:14.359
Don't put me off.

24:15.360 --> 24:18.238
Aren't you curious
about my childhood home?

24:18.920 --> 24:21.036
I'm curious about everything to do with you.

24:22.880 --> 24:25.235
But my situation would frighten them,

24:25.720 --> 24:27.631
and we don't want that.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.115
I know.

24:29.200 --> 24:31.191
Mama's giving a house party next month.

24:31.280 --> 24:32.998
Why don't you come?

24:33.320 --> 24:37.598
Then you can blend in and look around
without anyone asking too many questions.

24:38.160 --> 24:39.878
And Mama won't mind. She likes you.

24:40.120 --> 24:41.269
But your father doesn't.

24:42.120 --> 24:44.031
He doesn't know you.

24:44.120 --> 24:45.439
He'll like you when he does.

24:48.240 --> 24:52.950
Now, I must gulp my coffee down and run
if I'm to catch the three o'clock.

24:53.400 --> 24:55.118
I can't persuade you to stay?

25:03.280 --> 25:04.679
But I will say this...

25:06.000 --> 25:08.389
It's getting harder and harder to say no.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.597
Oh, look, we'll take that table.

25:58.280 --> 26:00.111
I'm not sure we should be here, m'lady.

26:00.200 --> 26:02.270
It seems unsuitable to me.

26:02.360 --> 26:04.396
Don't call me m'lady. Call me Rose.

26:04.480 --> 26:05.708
I can't.

26:05.800 --> 26:06.869
Well, then don't call me anything.

26:12.480 --> 26:13.629
Yes?

26:13.720 --> 26:15.756
Well, it is a <i>thé dansant.</i>

26:16.200 --> 26:17.315
Let's have a cup of tea.

26:17.800 --> 26:18.789
All right. Tea.

26:21.720 --> 26:23.472
Oh, but perhaps
with something special in mine?

26:24.240 --> 26:25.309
Right you are, miss.

26:26.320 --> 26:28.515
Listen! It's the one-step!

26:31.360 --> 26:32.952
Oh, why are they being so slow?

26:34.800 --> 26:38.110
Really, m'lady. You mustn't be so obvious.

26:38.200 --> 26:39.474
Why not?

26:39.840 --> 26:41.068
It's working.

26:43.960 --> 26:45.279
I don't s'pose you'd care to dance?

26:46.160 --> 26:47.593
Then you'd be wrong.

26:48.480 --> 26:49.833
Because I'd absolutely love to.

26:50.280 --> 26:51.793
Shouldn't we be introduced?

26:52.040 --> 26:53.758
Me name's Sam Thawley.

26:53.840 --> 26:54.829
How do?

26:55.040 --> 26:56.314
I'm Rose...

26:56.400 --> 26:57.753
Smith.

26:58.120 --> 26:59.235
Hello.

26:59.320 --> 27:00.514
I hope you know how to do this.

27:00.600 --> 27:01.589
You're in luck.

27:01.680 --> 27:03.398
They call me twinkle-toes.

27:09.600 --> 27:10.828
Hello, Anna.

27:10.960 --> 27:13.076
Jimmy? What are you doing here?

27:13.320 --> 27:14.878
I was just picking up some things
for Mrs Patmore.

27:16.200 --> 27:17.189
Shall we dance?

27:18.640 --> 27:19.675
We'd better.

27:19.760 --> 27:22.354
If only to check Lady Rose
isn't getting in too deep.

27:28.240 --> 27:30.959
I'm under-gardener for Lord Ellis.
Near Easingwold.

27:31.720 --> 27:33.711
- What about you?
- I'm at...

27:34.120 --> 27:35.155
I'm at Downton Abbey.

27:35.320 --> 27:36.389
Oh, yeah? What do you do?

27:36.480 --> 27:37.833
Are you a lady's maid?

27:38.360 --> 27:40.510
- You sound posh enough.
- Do I?

27:40.600 --> 27:42.556
I'm so pleased. I've...

27:42.640 --> 27:44.790
I've worked and worked on me accent.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.279
Ah, you've done well.

27:46.360 --> 27:48.316
You could pass for a real lady,
never mind a lady's maid.

27:48.480 --> 27:50.994
I'm not a lady's maid yet.

27:51.080 --> 27:53.116
Anna is. The girl I'm with.

27:53.200 --> 27:54.918
But I wonder if I'm clever enough.

27:55.080 --> 27:57.992
Ah, well, you won't be a housemaid forever.

27:58.080 --> 27:59.957
I expect you've got
a few young farmers hanging about.

28:00.800 --> 28:01.994
I couldn't say.

28:02.080 --> 28:04.071
You won't say, you mean.

28:04.560 --> 28:05.709
James?

28:06.160 --> 28:08.276
How, how, how did you find us?

28:08.360 --> 28:09.713
I saw you across the square, m'lady...

28:09.800 --> 28:11.995
Rose was just saying
what fun it is to be out like this.

28:12.120 --> 28:14.680
I thought I'd pop in
and see what the craic was.

28:14.760 --> 28:17.115
It's a good craic, isn't it, Sam?

28:17.200 --> 28:19.236
Well, it is with you in me arms.

28:24.920 --> 28:26.797
I love the view from up here.

28:28.360 --> 28:30.316
If you know the view, all the better.

28:30.840 --> 28:32.239
Follow that hedge,

28:33.280 --> 28:37.273
and to the left of it is Oakwood Farm,
to the right is all farmed by us.

28:38.440 --> 28:40.670
- Do we want to take over Oakwood Farm?
- No.

28:41.160 --> 28:43.515
The Olds are good tenants and hard workers.

28:46.480 --> 28:47.469
Hmm.

28:48.760 --> 28:51.399
There is one subject we ought to discuss.

28:52.080 --> 28:54.548
I know your position isn't settled,
but we should.

28:55.040 --> 28:56.393
Go on.

28:56.480 --> 28:58.118
The death duties.

28:58.640 --> 29:00.835
If you are the heir, it won't change them.

29:01.440 --> 29:03.476
There's no special treatment for widows.

29:03.560 --> 29:05.755
You do not surprise me.

29:06.520 --> 29:08.112
It seems odd, really,

29:08.200 --> 29:09.599
that you have to pay just as much tax

29:09.680 --> 29:12.148
as if he'd left it all to Mrs Tiggywinkle
down the road.

29:12.280 --> 29:13.349
Hmm.

29:13.440 --> 29:14.839
But that's how it works.

29:16.680 --> 29:18.511
So, what are we to do?

29:20.080 --> 29:23.675
Your father believes we should sell land
and pay it off in one lump.

29:24.120 --> 29:25.599
But you don't?

29:26.400 --> 29:28.391
I want to know what you think.

29:45.280 --> 29:46.918
I've some good tickets for me and lvy.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.638
To see Phyllis Dare?

29:49.440 --> 29:50.714
I don't believe you.

29:50.800 --> 29:53.553
Well, I have. It cost a packet and no mistake.

29:54.760 --> 29:55.875
Does Ivy know?

29:55.960 --> 29:57.188
Not yet.

29:58.320 --> 29:59.309
Mate, let's have a dance, eh?

29:59.400 --> 30:00.515
Sorry. I'm dancing with her.

30:00.600 --> 30:01.919
I said let her dance with me.

30:03.680 --> 30:04.874
I... I don't want to dance with you.

30:04.960 --> 30:06.109
How do you know if you've not even tried it?

30:07.120 --> 30:08.951
Don't tell me you're falling for her at last.

30:09.040 --> 30:10.075
She will be pleased.

30:10.160 --> 30:11.275
I said leave her alone!

30:11.400 --> 30:12.389
That's the idea.

30:13.160 --> 30:14.912
- Come on, then!
- Oh!

30:16.560 --> 30:18.232
Sam, are you okay?

30:18.840 --> 30:20.831
Get off me! Get off my hand!

30:23.000 --> 30:24.274
Get off him!

30:24.360 --> 30:26.396
Sam! Get off! Get off!

30:26.880 --> 30:28.393
- Sam!
- Get her out of here!

30:28.480 --> 30:30.311
- Get off him!
- Come here, you.

30:30.400 --> 30:31.389
James!

30:31.480 --> 30:32.469
I can't leave now!

30:32.560 --> 30:34.198
- Not when he's fighting to protect me!
- Oh, yes, you can.

30:34.280 --> 30:35.554
Or do you want to be arrested?

30:35.640 --> 30:36.868
We need to get out of here.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.393
Right, that settles it. Come on!

30:38.480 --> 30:39.469
Come on! Go, go, go!

30:45.840 --> 30:48.070
Mr Molesley, is that you?

30:48.640 --> 30:50.153
Come in and have a cup of tea.

30:50.240 --> 30:51.878
Mr Bates thought I might be welcome.

30:52.120 --> 30:53.633
And so you are.

30:53.880 --> 30:55.074
Sit down.

30:55.200 --> 30:56.269
Mr Molesley,

30:57.640 --> 30:58.993
I'm glad you're here.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.596
I was going through my desk this afternoon,

31:03.680 --> 31:08.390
and I came upon that note of mine
and, er, if you're willing,

31:09.160 --> 31:10.354
I'd like to pay it off now.

31:10.480 --> 31:11.469
What note?

31:11.560 --> 31:13.118
Well, you lent me some money
when I first came here.

31:13.200 --> 31:14.599
And I'm sorry
I haven't paid it back before now,

31:14.680 --> 31:17.592
but the truth is, I'm afraid I forgot.

31:18.320 --> 31:19.469
I don't remember anything about it.

31:19.760 --> 31:22.194
Thirty pounds!

31:22.280 --> 31:24.430
Aren't you the lucky one!

31:24.520 --> 31:25.589
Surely there must be some mistake?

31:25.680 --> 31:26.999
You'll not deny that's your signature?

31:27.080 --> 31:28.399
Plain as day.

31:28.480 --> 31:29.879
How was your trip to York?

31:29.960 --> 31:31.837
Never mind that. What's going on?

31:32.000 --> 31:35.470
Mr Bates has remembered
he owed thirty pounds to Mr Molesley.

31:35.640 --> 31:36.675
What?

31:36.800 --> 31:37.915
- But, but, but no...
- There you are.

31:38.040 --> 31:40.952
And thank you
for coming to my aid when I needed it.

31:41.720 --> 31:43.790
Now, I must go.

31:44.400 --> 31:47.119
I have some things to do
before his lordship comes up.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.355
Thank you, Mr Molesley.

31:53.320 --> 31:54.799
Mr Carson, could I have a word?

31:54.880 --> 31:56.359
Certainly, James.

32:02.200 --> 32:03.519
Why did you do that?

32:05.680 --> 32:07.398
You have put up with so much

32:07.480 --> 32:09.038
that I couldn't change.

32:09.960 --> 32:14.078
So if there is ever the slightest thing
I can make better for you, then I will.

32:14.400 --> 32:15.879
But how did you manage it?

32:16.160 --> 32:17.912
Don't I keep telling you?

32:18.440 --> 32:20.032
Prison was an education.

32:27.320 --> 32:28.833
Take her to the theatre?

32:28.920 --> 32:30.035
It is my half day.

32:30.200 --> 32:31.553
But not hers.

32:31.640 --> 32:33.312
And how do we know she'd want to go?

32:33.600 --> 32:34.828
She'll want to go.

32:35.160 --> 32:36.639
She could change her half day.

32:36.720 --> 32:40.315
Oh, I don't know.
It's turning into Liberty Hall around here.

32:41.320 --> 32:42.548
Are we entertaining that night?

32:43.000 --> 32:46.436
I'm not cooking. They'll all be dining
with Lady Lawson at Brough Hall.

32:46.800 --> 32:49.519
Very well. But no lingering.

32:49.680 --> 32:51.238
You can go and give her the good news.

32:51.600 --> 32:53.158
Thank you, Mr Carson.

32:58.560 --> 33:01.393
I hope he doesn't break her heart.

33:01.680 --> 33:05.434
We must all have our hearts broken
once or twice before we're done.

33:05.520 --> 33:07.476
True enough, Mrs Hughes.

33:10.840 --> 33:14.753
Strange to think the theatre
was part of my life at one time.

33:16.840 --> 33:19.035
Yours and Mr Grigg's.

33:21.480 --> 33:23.436
You know he's going to work in Belfast?

33:23.800 --> 33:24.949
I had heard.

33:25.120 --> 33:27.190
He's leaving the village in the morning.

33:28.040 --> 33:30.679
- The 11:00 train.
- What's that to me?

33:31.680 --> 33:33.830
I'll tell you what it is.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.752
It's an open wound.

33:37.480 --> 33:40.233
I don't know why, but I do know this;

33:41.080 --> 33:43.674
You'd do better to stitch it up and let it heal.

33:50.880 --> 33:52.518
I'm sorry, m'lord, but I didn't hear the gong.

33:52.640 --> 33:54.232
It's all right. It hasn't gone yet.

33:54.720 --> 33:56.392
I was hoping to catch you.

33:56.880 --> 33:59.997
Of course, I understand how tiresome
it must have been for Anna

34:00.080 --> 34:03.311
when Edna came back
and was suddenly the senior lady's maid.

34:03.480 --> 34:04.469
M'lord?

34:04.560 --> 34:05.788
Ask her to go easy.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.956
I'm sorry, m'lord,
but I don't understand what you're saying.

34:09.280 --> 34:10.632
Her ladyship appears to think

34:10.719 --> 34:13.518
there's been some bad feeling
between Braithwaite and Anna.

34:13.600 --> 34:15.591
That Anna has been a little unkind.

34:15.960 --> 34:16.949
Not that I know of.

34:17.120 --> 34:18.438
Look, I don't want to make a thing of it.

34:18.520 --> 34:21.159
I'm just asking for a little consideration,
that's all.

34:21.800 --> 34:22.835
And you shall have it, m'lord.

34:23.040 --> 34:24.313
Good.

34:24.400 --> 34:26.960
That's all I needed to hear.
Ah, there's the gong now.

34:31.480 --> 34:33.072
I just can't believe you're letting me go.

34:33.159 --> 34:34.275
Do you really mean it?

34:34.360 --> 34:36.315
No, I was having you on.

34:37.520 --> 34:38.793
Oh, don't be so soft.

34:38.880 --> 34:40.710
I've said you can go and you can go.

34:40.800 --> 34:42.835
- What should I wear?
- Clothes.

34:42.920 --> 34:44.273
But I haven't got anything right.

34:44.480 --> 34:46.277
Not for the theatre in York.

34:46.360 --> 34:47.839
It's not Covent Garden.

34:48.040 --> 34:49.074
What?

34:49.159 --> 34:50.353
Oh, never mind.

34:50.440 --> 34:53.112
We'll make you look presentable.
Now get that parsley.

34:56.120 --> 34:59.032
I don't know why she's so excited.
It's only a bloomin' play.

35:06.400 --> 35:07.833
He's just as keen on her as ever.

35:08.560 --> 35:09.709
We'll see.

35:09.800 --> 35:12.917
Nothing's as changeable
as a young man's heart.

35:13.240 --> 35:15.549
Take hope and a warning from that.

35:50.880 --> 35:52.279
I'll get it.

35:57.440 --> 35:58.429
Yes?

35:58.520 --> 36:00.670
I was wondering if I could have a word
with the housemaid, Rose.

36:00.760 --> 36:01.795
"The housemaid, Rose"?

36:01.880 --> 36:03.313
The maid, Rose, who works here.

36:03.400 --> 36:04.389
Look, chum...

36:04.480 --> 36:05.993
I'll deal with it, Mr Barrow.

36:07.080 --> 36:08.433
Hello, Mr Thawley.

36:09.880 --> 36:11.552
Well, I'll leave you to it.

36:14.120 --> 36:15.792
I've got to know she's all right.

36:15.880 --> 36:18.235
Rose is a bit busy just now.
But I'll tell her you asked.

36:18.320 --> 36:19.435
I don't mind waiting.

36:21.200 --> 36:23.430
Can I, er, can I come in?

36:24.320 --> 36:27.153
If you'll just stay there,
I'll, I'll see what she's up to.

36:31.840 --> 36:33.034
Anna?

36:33.400 --> 36:34.879
What, what is it?

36:35.480 --> 36:37.994
The man that you were dancing with.
Sam Thawley.

36:38.280 --> 36:39.269
He's downstairs.

36:40.480 --> 36:41.629
But why?

36:41.720 --> 36:42.789
What, what does he want?

36:42.880 --> 36:44.950
He says he's come to make sure
that you're all right.

36:45.240 --> 36:46.832
Well, what have you done with him?

36:47.040 --> 36:49.679
Left him in the yard
before he asks the others any questions.

36:50.800 --> 36:53.030
But what can I say? What can I do?

36:55.120 --> 36:56.633
Come with me. I've got an idea.

37:18.520 --> 37:19.839
This is so very kind of you.

37:20.040 --> 37:21.519
No, I had to come.

37:21.920 --> 37:23.512
You know, I had to see that you were, er...

37:25.240 --> 37:27.071
You know, all right after that ruckus.

37:28.040 --> 37:30.395
And I... and I am.
 Thanks to you.

37:31.040 --> 37:32.359
I never saw anything so brave

37:32.440 --> 37:34.431
as the way you punched that horrid man.

37:35.200 --> 37:36.872
I'd do more than that for you.

37:39.440 --> 37:40.589
How very flattering.

37:41.840 --> 37:44.354
Where did you grow up?
You don't sound very Yorkshire.

37:44.680 --> 37:45.954
Don't I?

37:47.040 --> 37:50.669
That's, that's because my life's been sort of

37:50.760 --> 37:52.159
spent all over the place.

37:52.560 --> 37:55.313
North, south, east, west...

37:57.320 --> 37:59.151
Home's the place that I love best.

37:59.960 --> 38:01.075
What?

38:01.760 --> 38:03.273
That's how the song goes.

38:04.640 --> 38:07.074
Yes I, I suppose it is.

38:10.480 --> 38:12.357
Would you let me call on you again?

38:13.200 --> 38:15.031
- Well...
- Look, I know I'm not good enough for you,

38:16.000 --> 38:17.149
I can see that.

38:17.400 --> 38:18.674
But I'm a steady chap.

38:19.400 --> 38:21.038
Ask Lord Ellis's agent.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.479
- He'd give me a good reference.
- I'm sure...

38:24.080 --> 38:25.752
But it's, it's something else.

38:26.600 --> 38:27.828
Do you remember wondering

38:27.920 --> 38:30.309
if any of the local farmers were after me?

38:32.600 --> 38:34.272
- Yeah.
- Well, that's the thing.

38:34.360 --> 38:36.316
I... There is one farmer

38:36.400 --> 38:39.039
and I didn't want to spoil this afternoon
by mentioning it,

38:39.120 --> 38:41.429
but I've rather given him my word.

38:45.920 --> 38:47.672
Well, that's me back in me box, then.

38:47.800 --> 38:49.631
I hope you understand.

38:51.320 --> 38:52.878
Course I do.

38:52.960 --> 38:54.757
He's a lucky bloke, that's all I'll say.

38:57.080 --> 38:58.513
Well, good luck, then.

38:59.120 --> 39:00.155
It's been nice knowing you.

39:02.520 --> 39:03.794
You, too.

39:07.320 --> 39:08.389
And Mr Thawley...

39:09.600 --> 39:10.669
Sam.

39:13.200 --> 39:14.599
When you do find someone...

39:15.680 --> 39:18.956
Someone much nicer and better than I am...

39:20.840 --> 39:22.068
She'll be a very lucky girl.

39:36.360 --> 39:37.475
What the...

39:38.080 --> 39:40.275
Say nothing and I'll be your friend forever.

39:46.880 --> 39:48.836
Is Lord Grantham in the drawing room?

39:50.000 --> 39:51.399
Thank you.

39:59.840 --> 40:01.353
Ah, here she is.

40:01.800 --> 40:02.915
Ah, darling.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.036
Ah, are you only just back?

40:05.760 --> 40:07.273
We sat for ever outside Peterborough.

40:07.360 --> 40:10.397
We never found out why. Shall I change?

40:10.560 --> 40:12.357
No, don't bother. It's only us.

40:12.440 --> 40:14.351
And who are we to warrant any courtesy?

40:14.520 --> 40:16.033
Don't be difficult, Granny.

40:16.160 --> 40:17.559
Where's Rose? Have we lost her?

40:19.280 --> 40:20.315
I'm so sorry I'm late.

40:20.400 --> 40:21.992
Never mind, never mind.

40:25.640 --> 40:27.073
Now I've got you all here,

40:27.160 --> 40:29.549
and before Carson comes in,
I have something to say.

40:30.120 --> 40:31.792
I had a letter today from Murray...

40:33.600 --> 40:35.670
Wait just a moment while I finish.

40:35.760 --> 40:37.113
Shall I leave, m'lord?

40:37.880 --> 40:39.518
No. You might as well hear this.

40:39.760 --> 40:42.752
Murray has taken Matthew's letter
to various authorities

40:42.840 --> 40:47.038
and their conclusion is that it demonstrates
"testamentary intention".

40:47.120 --> 40:49.190
- What's that?
- It means that the writer

40:49.280 --> 40:51.748
intended the document to serve as a will.

40:52.480 --> 40:54.710
- So the bequest stands?
- Yes.

40:55.680 --> 40:57.238
Mary owns half the estate.

40:57.960 --> 40:58.949
Hmm.

40:59.040 --> 41:00.439
That sounds like a very good result.

41:00.600 --> 41:03.956
And now we should go into dinner
before Mrs Patmore blows a gasket.

41:09.720 --> 41:11.995
Dearest Papa,
I hope you're not too disappointed.

41:12.080 --> 41:13.593
Don't be silly. Not at all.

41:13.920 --> 41:16.798
Perhaps the three of us can sit down
tomorrow and talk properly?

41:16.880 --> 41:19.633
Of course.
But the main problem is a simple one. Tax.

41:19.720 --> 41:20.709
But that's it.

41:20.800 --> 41:23.360
Tom's told me
you want to sell land to pay for it.

41:23.920 --> 41:25.797
It's the only way, I'm afraid.

41:25.880 --> 41:27.632
Yes, but you see, I don't agree.

41:29.760 --> 41:31.876
Anyway, let's not talk about it now.

41:31.960 --> 41:33.439
We ought to join the others.

41:39.520 --> 41:41.078
If you've put her up to this...

41:41.160 --> 41:42.912
I haven't put her up to anything.

41:43.920 --> 41:45.478
But you won't keep her quiet.

41:45.880 --> 41:47.154
Not now the bit's between her teeth.

41:47.760 --> 41:49.239
Don't think that you will.

41:51.360 --> 41:53.316
I don't know what he meant.

41:53.400 --> 41:55.231
You must have said something?

41:55.320 --> 41:57.072
But I haven't said anything.

41:58.800 --> 42:00.631
I warned her off Mr Barrow, that's all.

42:00.720 --> 42:02.358
But I wasn't having a go at her.

42:02.440 --> 42:04.829
All I can tell you is that
she has managed to take offence.

42:04.920 --> 42:06.876
She can't have.

42:13.920 --> 42:14.955
Mr Barrow,

42:15.120 --> 42:16.473
what are you doing down here?

42:16.720 --> 42:18.711
Will you come up this moment
and help me serve the wine?

42:18.800 --> 42:20.836
Sorry, Mr Carson. I'm on my way.

42:36.320 --> 42:37.355
What's so funny?

42:39.840 --> 42:41.512
Nothing, Mr Bates.

42:42.720 --> 42:44.233
Nothing at all.

43:43.440 --> 43:44.668
Good morning, Carson.

43:46.520 --> 43:48.078
I hope I'm not in the way.

43:48.160 --> 43:49.275
Not a bit.

43:50.200 --> 43:51.599
You remember Mr Grigg.

43:55.600 --> 43:57.113
Hello, Charlie.

43:58.120 --> 43:59.872
Good of you to come.

44:07.200 --> 44:08.189
I'm delighted.

44:08.720 --> 44:10.233
But I'm not surprised.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.274
Aren't you?

44:12.360 --> 44:14.271
Because I'm astonished.

44:15.440 --> 44:17.954
But why did you never speak
of Alice when we last met,

44:18.280 --> 44:20.874
- before the war?
- What was the point?

44:20.960 --> 44:24.191
She chose you all those years ago,
and that was it.

44:24.280 --> 44:25.395
Why bring it up?

44:25.480 --> 44:27.038
Because it wasn't "it".

44:27.640 --> 44:30.154
She chose me, but it never worked.

44:30.560 --> 44:32.551
She's dead now anyway.

44:32.640 --> 44:34.551
But it was never "it".

44:37.120 --> 44:39.111
I didn't know she was dead.

44:39.200 --> 44:40.553
Five year ago.

44:40.640 --> 44:42.278
We'd separated long before,

44:42.800 --> 44:44.995
but I went to see her in St Thomas's.

44:45.240 --> 44:46.719
Do you know what she said?

44:46.800 --> 44:49.792
She said,
"Charlie Carson was the better man.

44:50.760 --> 44:51.829
"I could have loved him.

44:52.720 --> 44:54.278
"I did love him, really.

44:55.400 --> 44:57.595
"But I was a fool and couldn't see it."

44:58.600 --> 45:00.318
Did she say that?

45:00.400 --> 45:01.833
Honestly?

45:01.920 --> 45:03.592
That she loved you?

45:03.680 --> 45:05.193
Aye, she did.

45:06.400 --> 45:08.231
And she wanted me to tell you,
if I saw you again.

45:09.400 --> 45:10.628
There we are.

45:10.720 --> 45:12.631
We could have made a go of it, you know.

45:13.320 --> 45:14.992
As long as you know that it were her choice.

45:15.400 --> 45:17.277
I never set out to take her off you.

45:17.360 --> 45:19.237
All aboard.

45:19.360 --> 45:22.636
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I think you must get aboard.

45:26.880 --> 45:29.110
I can't tell you how grateful I am, Mrs Crawley.

45:29.280 --> 45:30.679
- Very good luck.
- Thank you.

45:35.040 --> 45:36.359
I doubt we'll meet again,

45:37.920 --> 45:39.239
but can we shake on it?

45:40.760 --> 45:43.593
We've known some
ups and downs together, it's true.

45:43.680 --> 45:44.999
But if this is goodbye...

45:46.080 --> 45:47.638
let's part as friends, eh?

45:49.160 --> 45:50.388
All right.

45:52.160 --> 45:53.195
I wish you well.

45:54.120 --> 45:56.156
Likewise...

45:56.240 --> 45:57.389
Charlie.

46:07.560 --> 46:08.834
Mrs Crawley,

46:08.960 --> 46:10.678
I should be grateful if you would let me know

46:10.760 --> 46:13.797
any expense you have been put to
on Mr Grigg's behalf

46:13.880 --> 46:15.108
during his stay with you.

46:15.200 --> 46:17.475
Oh, no. That's completely unnecessary...

46:17.560 --> 46:19.596
I should be grateful.

46:22.400 --> 46:24.231
Very well, Carson. I shall do that.

46:26.400 --> 46:28.072
Good day to you.

46:39.880 --> 46:41.199
Mr Carson?

46:42.320 --> 46:44.231
Shall we walk back together?

46:45.305 --> 46:51.450
