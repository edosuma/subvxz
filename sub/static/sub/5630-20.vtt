10:15.015 --> 10:16.915
I would never do this.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.116

ten months ago?

10:18.118 --> 10:19.784
Last July,
who were you with?

10:19.786 --> 10:24.723
- July--here in Chicago?

10:24.725 --> 10:26.124
No.
- What? What?

10:26.126 --> 10:28.159
- The Blues Fest--first couple
days of July last year.

10:28.161 --> 10:30.195
There was a girl.
- What's her name?

10:30.197 --> 10:32.130

I was really high.

Dark-haired, white.

10:41.842 --> 10:44.275
She had a bird on her shirt,
like a school jersey.

It had a hawk on it.

14:54.527 --> 14:55.960

14:55.962 --> 14:59.330
We decided Tana
would drop out of school,

14:59.332 --> 15:02.901
and once the baby
was born...

15:02.903 --> 15:04.569
we would give it
to a family

15:04.571 --> 15:07.205
where it could have a good life
and so could Tana.
