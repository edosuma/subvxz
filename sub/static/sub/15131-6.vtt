WEBVTT

00:08.385 --> 00:09.952
What?

00:13.990 --> 00:16.692
Aroooo!

00:16.726 --> 00:17.993
What...

00:18.027 --> 00:19.928
- is that?
- Ar-ar-arooo!

00:19.963 --> 00:21.029
Oh.

00:21.064 --> 00:22.497
What time is it?

00:22.531 --> 00:24.132
The sun's set. Bad moon's rising.

00:24.166 --> 00:26.234
Zach needs all hands on deck in the E.R.

00:26.268 --> 00:27.836
Well, I'm on a double shift.

00:27.870 --> 00:29.771
Yeah, so am I. Come on. Up, up, up.

00:29.806 --> 00:31.640
- Let's go.
- Damn.

00:31.674 --> 00:33.174
Alex, let's go!

00:33.209 --> 00:34.942
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

00:34.977 --> 00:37.412
I'm up. I'm up.

00:37.446 --> 00:39.581
I'm up.

00:39.615 --> 00:41.682
Yes, I understand, sir, but it
shouldn't be too much longer,

00:41.717 --> 00:43.084
so you'll just have to wait here, okay?

00:43.119 --> 00:44.219
It's just a scrape, anyway.

00:44.253 --> 00:45.753
It is a madhouse in here. A madhouse!

00:45.787 --> 00:47.655
- - Code yellow.
It's a full moon. Makes everyone crazy.

00:47.689 --> 00:48.856
It's not just a full moon.

00:48.890 --> 00:49.991
- Code yellow in effect.
- It's a blood moon.

00:50.025 --> 00:51.258
Is that worse?

00:51.292 --> 00:53.094
A red lunar eclipse...
a sign of the apocalypse.

00:53.161 --> 00:54.394
So, that's a "yes," then.

00:54.429 --> 00:56.263
You picked a heck of a night
to take extra call.

00:56.297 --> 00:58.265
I guess I forgot
to check my farmers' almanac.

00:58.299 --> 01:00.668
Someone just threw
their gangrenous toe at me.

01:00.702 --> 01:02.336
I think that means he likes you.

01:02.370 --> 01:03.871
Ugh.

01:03.939 --> 01:05.239
What do we have?

01:05.306 --> 01:07.974
I've got an 18-year-old male,
fence-related injury.

01:08.042 --> 01:11.445
- Ooh, dibs.
- Nice.

01:11.479 --> 01:12.546
"Fell off a fence."

01:12.614 --> 01:13.813
I thought you said "fencing injury."

01:13.848 --> 01:15.849
No takebacks.

01:19.621 --> 01:23.190
What's with the harbingers of doom?

01:30.497 --> 01:31.631
Code yellow.

01:31.666 --> 01:33.566
Repeat... code yellow in effect.

01:33.600 --> 01:35.001
Code yellow.

01:41.775 --> 01:43.842
Sorry. Just gonna get by you here.

01:43.877 --> 01:45.178
Which way is the morgue?

01:45.245 --> 01:46.379
What?

01:46.446 --> 01:48.281
I'm dead. I belong there.

01:48.348 --> 01:50.449
Uh, I don't really have time
for this right now.

01:50.517 --> 01:52.084
Can you tell me where it is?

01:52.152 --> 01:53.719
Yeah. It's in the basement.

01:53.787 --> 01:55.621
Just, um, picture yourself there.

01:55.656 --> 01:57.322
You're gonna...

01:57.356 --> 01:59.725
you'll figure it out.

02:06.265 --> 02:07.199
Going down?

02:07.266 --> 02:08.701
Don't answer that.

02:13.539 --> 02:16.074
It's a busy night.

02:16.141 --> 02:17.842
Charlie, you know I hate small talk.

02:17.910 --> 02:20.412
Life's too short.

02:20.479 --> 02:23.014
We slept together.

02:23.082 --> 02:26.751
I-I don't... I don't know
how to do this right now, Dawn.

02:28.854 --> 02:30.855
- Right.
- It's complicated.

02:30.889 --> 02:34.358
Well, it's... complicated for me, too.

02:37.429 --> 02:39.697
What was that?

02:41.000 --> 02:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:01.720 --> 03:04.020
Excuse me. Excuse me.

03:04.088 --> 03:05.622
You find my code yellow?

03:05.656 --> 03:06.757
She found us.

03:06.791 --> 03:08.225
Patient managed to pry open the doors

03:08.259 --> 03:09.726
and then jump down the elevator shaft.

03:09.761 --> 03:10.794
Vida's catatonic.

03:10.828 --> 03:12.195
She wouldn't even get out of bed.

03:12.263 --> 03:15.198
Well, she did, and now
we're all on the hook for it.

03:15.233 --> 03:18.101
Wait a second.

03:18.136 --> 03:20.270
I know her.

03:20.304 --> 03:21.604
I-I was talking to her
in the hallway earlier.

03:21.639 --> 03:22.838
That's impossible.

03:22.906 --> 03:24.407
She hasn't spoken a word
since she was admitted.

03:24.441 --> 03:26.476
Uh, Vida, is it? Try not to move.

03:26.510 --> 03:28.444
Can you tell me where it hurts?

03:28.479 --> 03:30.780
My body's not working.

03:30.814 --> 03:32.081
Um, we're gonna get you a CT

03:32.115 --> 03:33.583
and then check out these injuries.

03:33.617 --> 03:34.584
All right, guys. Let's go.

03:34.618 --> 03:36.051
She speaks to you.

03:36.086 --> 03:37.787
You must have a gift.

03:44.427 --> 03:46.428
Roberto, I'm Dr. Reid.

03:46.462 --> 03:48.397
What happened to you?

03:48.431 --> 03:49.665
I was climbing a fence,

03:49.699 --> 03:51.366
and I slipped, landed on my heel.

03:51.401 --> 03:52.634
Let's get you an X-ray.

03:52.669 --> 03:54.670
It looks like you have a lover's fracture.

03:54.704 --> 03:56.104
Ooh.

03:56.138 --> 03:57.238
In my foot?

03:57.273 --> 03:59.240
It's called that because it's caused

03:59.275 --> 04:01.610
by landing on your heel from a height,

04:01.644 --> 04:04.179
like Don Juan trying to escape
his lover's husband.

04:04.213 --> 04:07.182
You're the first person
to call me a Don Juan.

04:07.216 --> 04:09.350
Although I was chasing someone.

04:09.384 --> 04:10.651
What happened?

04:10.686 --> 04:11.719
Ah.

04:11.787 --> 04:16.858
Um, my girlfriend... wife, actually.

04:16.892 --> 04:18.091
We got married tonight.

04:18.127 --> 04:20.028
Wow. Congratulations.

04:20.062 --> 04:21.495
Thanks.

04:21.529 --> 04:26.801
Uh, guess I'm her "something blue."

04:26.868 --> 04:32.005
She climbed a fence
after jumping out of our taxi.

04:32.040 --> 04:33.974
While it was moving?

04:35.510 --> 04:38.145
Don't cold feet usually come
before the wedding?

04:38.179 --> 04:40.681
I'll page someone
from orthopedics for your foot,

04:40.749 --> 04:42.782
and I'll be back in a couple of minutes

04:42.851 --> 04:44.718
to check on your wife, Don Juan.

04:46.955 --> 04:48.288
Hey, Maggie.

04:48.356 --> 04:49.990
Hey.

04:50.024 --> 04:51.524
You see that bride out there?

04:51.592 --> 04:52.726
Yep.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.561
She jumped out of a moving vehicle.

04:54.595 --> 04:56.563
You're telling me this because...?

04:56.630 --> 04:58.765
I need you to make sure
she goes through triage.

04:58.833 --> 05:00.066
Where are you going?

05:00.133 --> 05:01.200
To find Joel.

05:01.268 --> 05:02.935
He's in the morgue harvesting bones,

05:02.970 --> 05:04.437
and there's no cell reception.

05:04.505 --> 05:05.839
Why don't you send a nurse?

05:05.906 --> 05:07.273
'Cause I need the air.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.242
Right, because when I think of fresh air,

05:09.309 --> 05:10.443
I think of the morgue.

05:11.779 --> 05:13.480
I could use the walk.

05:17.751 --> 05:20.753
Joel.

05:21.821 --> 05:22.855
Good evening.

05:24.724 --> 05:27.826
You should not sneak up
on somebody in the morgue.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.395
You are jumpier than usual.

05:29.462 --> 05:31.630
Well, I'm running on less than
three hours of sleep.

05:31.698 --> 05:33.331
The E.R. beckons you.

05:33.366 --> 05:34.500
And you came here personally to fetch me.

05:34.567 --> 05:35.634
That's very sweet of you.

05:35.702 --> 05:37.836
Well, according to Zach, the end is nigh.

05:37.904 --> 05:40.038
According to the milk I just purchased,

05:40.072 --> 05:41.874
we have at least 10 days, so...

05:43.643 --> 05:45.577
What would you do if it was the end?

05:45.612 --> 05:47.979
I would...

05:48.014 --> 05:50.282
spend time with friends and family.

05:51.784 --> 05:54.119
Okay. Okay, fine.

05:54.186 --> 05:56.687
Um, eat cheese and rob a bank.

05:56.755 --> 05:57.956
That's better.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.357
What about you?

05:59.392 --> 06:01.159
What would you do if this was
your last night on Earth?

06:20.065 --> 06:21.768
You do realize there have been
studies debunking

06:21.892 --> 06:23.841
the full moon's effect
on emergency rooms, right?

06:23.875 --> 06:25.409
And yet, the E.R. is chock-full of crazy.

06:25.444 --> 06:26.744
Okay, tell me something.

06:26.778 --> 06:29.680
When has the emergency room
been chock-full of sanity?

06:29.714 --> 06:30.981
Zach really got to you

06:31.016 --> 06:33.751
with this whole
apocalyptic nonsense, didn't he?

06:33.785 --> 06:35.019
Apocalypse? No.

06:35.053 --> 06:36.987
But weird things do happen
during full moons.

06:37.022 --> 06:39.056
Weird things happen to you
anyway, Alex Reid.

06:39.090 --> 06:41.391
- What about the earthquake?
- What?

06:41.425 --> 06:44.028
What do you think it was? Plate tectonics.

06:44.062 --> 06:45.696
Maybe a sign.

06:45.730 --> 06:47.497
What kind of sign?

06:47.532 --> 06:49.099
Red, octagonal...

06:50.168 --> 06:52.036
We did not cause an earthquake.

06:52.070 --> 06:53.803
No, that's not what I said.

06:53.837 --> 06:55.305
You are so superstitious.

06:55.339 --> 06:56.439
No, I'm not.

06:56.474 --> 06:57.574
You 100% are.

06:57.642 --> 06:59.376
I mean, you hide it pretty well,

06:59.410 --> 07:02.179
and most people don't notice it,
but you definitely are.

07:02.213 --> 07:03.480
Example...

07:03.514 --> 07:05.248
you always put on
your left surgical glove first.

07:05.316 --> 07:08.485
I'm taking it as a sign, Joel.

07:08.519 --> 07:11.554
Oh, it's definitely a sign of something.

07:11.588 --> 07:13.422
Your Don Juan's over there.

07:14.858 --> 07:16.025
Interesting.

07:16.093 --> 07:17.393
I didn't know there was
a prophet named Joel.

07:17.427 --> 07:19.662
He's a minor prophet.

07:19.730 --> 07:21.964
Any damage from the earthquake?

07:21.999 --> 07:23.032
What earthquake?

07:43.920 --> 07:45.721
I think we got to move this overflow

07:45.755 --> 07:47.355
to the auditorium, all right?

07:58.534 --> 07:59.734
Hi, dad.

07:59.801 --> 08:01.669
Jacob, are you hurt?

08:01.737 --> 08:03.070
Are you okay?

08:03.138 --> 08:04.205
Yeah.

08:04.240 --> 08:05.273
What...

08:05.341 --> 08:07.308
what are you doing here?

08:07.343 --> 08:09.344
I'll ask an easier question.

08:09.411 --> 08:10.778
How did you get here?

08:10.846 --> 08:12.247
I skated.

08:12.314 --> 08:13.314
You what?

08:13.382 --> 08:15.616
I couldn't sleep. I was bored.

08:15.683 --> 08:17.952
So you just skateboarded
halfway across the city

08:18.019 --> 08:19.453
in the dark to my hospital?

08:19.520 --> 08:21.688
It's actually pretty light out
with the full moon.

08:21.757 --> 08:22.990
Are you out of your mind?

08:23.058 --> 08:24.825
Dad, relax.

08:24.893 --> 08:26.693
Hey, you're supposed to be at your mother's.

08:26.728 --> 08:28.129
She's probably called the cops.

08:28.163 --> 08:29.797
I don't even know what to say
to you right now.

08:29.831 --> 08:31.632
You could have been run over or worse.

08:31.699 --> 08:32.765
Jesus, dad.

08:32.799 --> 08:35.769
Don't you swear at me, Jacob Miller.

08:35.803 --> 08:37.304
Dad, really.

08:37.371 --> 08:39.706
Jesus. Look.

08:39.774 --> 08:42.376
I'm looking for the emergency room.

08:45.212 --> 08:48.181
Okay. Somebody will be with you shortly.

08:50.785 --> 08:53.552
I saw the water, and I wanted to
go skinny-dipping.

08:53.587 --> 08:55.454
It doesn't get any more romantic

08:55.489 --> 08:57.390
than a night like this, does it?

08:57.424 --> 08:59.125
I'm gonna draw some blood, Elisa.

08:59.193 --> 09:00.660
Stop that.

09:00.727 --> 09:03.963
It's okay. No one likes needles.

09:04.031 --> 09:07.132
Just take a deep breath, okay?

09:07.200 --> 09:09.168
Here we go.

09:09.202 --> 09:11.504
So, how did you and Roberto meet?

09:11.538 --> 09:15.374
Our seminary school hosts
a theology on the rocks night.

09:15.409 --> 09:17.510
According to your chart,
you're too young to drink.

09:17.544 --> 09:20.145
We just go for the theology.

09:20.180 --> 09:22.147
He bought me a safe sex on the beach.

09:22.182 --> 09:23.548
And I know what you're thinking.

09:23.582 --> 09:24.649
If you're too young to drink,

09:24.717 --> 09:25.918
then you're too young to be married,

09:25.985 --> 09:27.219
but we're just drunk in love,
us and BeyoncÃ©.

09:28.021 --> 09:29.188
Are you okay, Elisa?

09:29.222 --> 09:31.156
I told you. I'm fine.

09:31.191 --> 09:32.457
Really fine.

09:32.491 --> 09:33.892
Not fine. Divine.

09:33.927 --> 09:35.093
I'm a missus.

09:35.128 --> 09:36.561
Look at my veil.

09:37.763 --> 09:39.397
Have you taken any drugs tonight?

09:39.432 --> 09:41.999
Of course not. I don't even drink.

09:42.034 --> 09:43.335
Okay.

09:43.369 --> 09:45.603
Let's get her a tox screen
and keep her overnight.

09:46.706 --> 09:48.873
Dr. Goran should be done with Roberto soon.

09:48.907 --> 09:50.408
I'll book the honeymoon suite.

09:55.380 --> 09:57.448
All right.

09:57.482 --> 09:59.750
And...

09:59.784 --> 10:01.252
there.

10:01.286 --> 10:04.055
Looks good.

10:04.089 --> 10:06.123
Sir, her-her CT scan looks normal.

10:06.158 --> 10:08.092
Um, why do we need an X-ray?

10:08.126 --> 10:10.127
Because atlanto-occipital dissociation

10:10.162 --> 10:12.363
can be missed even on a CT.

10:12.397 --> 10:14.931
Okay.

10:14.966 --> 10:18.034
I'm gonna do a provocative traction test.

10:18.069 --> 10:19.770
Sir, you're gonna pull her head?

10:19.838 --> 10:21.438
Couldn't that kill her?

10:21.506 --> 10:23.273
Only if I pull too hard.

10:30.281 --> 10:32.782
All right, Dr. Larouche, what do we see?

10:32.816 --> 10:34.751
Her skull's completely separated
from her spine.

10:34.785 --> 10:36.386
Internal decapitation.

10:36.420 --> 10:37.754
Why isn't she dead?

10:37.821 --> 10:41.358
Well, if I move her head
the wrong way, she will be.

10:41.425 --> 10:44.093
And she's catatonic, not deaf.

10:46.162 --> 10:49.031
How does an in-patient end up
down a hospital elevator shaft?

10:49.099 --> 10:50.867
I know it's a busy night,
but you think somebody would have seen her.

10:50.934 --> 10:54.704
Yeah. You'd think.

10:56.507 --> 10:57.707
Hey, Joel.

10:57.775 --> 10:59.742
Am I still picking you up
from the airport?

10:59.810 --> 11:01.277
Well, yeah.

11:01.311 --> 11:03.345
Unless you're having second
thoughts about the whole thing.

11:03.380 --> 11:06.715
Now, don't you forget
to pack your thongs.

11:06.749 --> 11:07.783
Yes, ma'am.

11:08.985 --> 11:10.852
- I'll see you soon.
- See you soon.

11:10.921 --> 11:11.987
Kiss, kiss.

11:12.055 --> 11:13.755
Kiss, kiss.

11:13.823 --> 11:17.592
Goodbye.

11:17.660 --> 11:21.262
Looks sunny wherever she is.

11:21.330 --> 11:24.098
Yes, it is summer in Auckland right now.

11:24.166 --> 11:25.600
You're going to New Zealand?

11:25.635 --> 11:27.702
I am going to a wedding, yes.

11:27.770 --> 11:28.804
Hmm.

11:28.871 --> 11:31.473
Is, uh, "yes, ma'am" your date?

11:31.541 --> 11:33.441
You know, what is your problem?

11:33.508 --> 11:35.944
You're not gonna get any
calling her "ma'am."

11:36.011 --> 11:37.678
Just a tip.

11:37.746 --> 11:40.048
Kiss, kiss!

11:40.115 --> 11:41.215
Kiss, kiss.

11:42.551 --> 11:44.052
Doing all right?

11:44.086 --> 11:45.820
- You sure?
- Yeah.

11:47.423 --> 11:48.689
Roberto, how's the foot?

11:48.757 --> 11:50.057
Dr. Goran said it was fine.

11:50.091 --> 11:52.693
He used more syllables than that.

11:52.727 --> 11:54.862
Well, it's good to hear.

11:54.896 --> 11:57.297
Elisa, I have your lab results.

11:57.332 --> 11:58.799
Do you want to hear them together?

11:58.867 --> 12:00.367
Of course. We're married.

12:00.401 --> 12:01.635
Okay.

12:01.703 --> 12:03.303
Your tox screen is clean.

12:03.338 --> 12:05.005
What did I tell you?

12:05.073 --> 12:06.806
But there's something else.

12:06.841 --> 12:07.975
You're pregnant.

12:08.009 --> 12:09.642
Oh, my god.

12:09.710 --> 12:12.512
No, no, we've only been married for an hour.

12:12.580 --> 12:13.613
No, no, no.

12:13.681 --> 12:15.648
It's impossible. I can't be pregnant.

12:15.683 --> 12:17.084
Why don't you take a minute?

12:17.118 --> 12:18.751
I'll have a nurse from obstetrics

12:18.819 --> 12:20.120
come speak with you, okay?

12:20.188 --> 12:21.821
No, no, you don't understand.

12:21.889 --> 12:24.423
I-I can't be pregnant. I'm a virgin.

12:27.628 --> 12:29.028
Shotgun wedding, huh?

12:29.096 --> 12:32.431
She says she's a virgin,
but blood tests don't lie.

12:32.466 --> 12:33.766
People do.

12:33.801 --> 12:35.468
She's going to be a minister.

12:35.503 --> 12:38.004
She doesn't exactly seem like
the cheating type.

12:38.038 --> 12:42.241
Did you know Joel was going to New Zealand?

12:42.275 --> 12:44.776
No. He hasn't mentioned it.

12:44.811 --> 12:47.046
You should see his date.

12:47.080 --> 12:49.281
"Don't forget to pack your thong."

12:49.316 --> 12:51.884
He has a date?

12:51.918 --> 12:54.453
And a thong, apparently.

12:54.488 --> 12:56.922
Unless "thong" means "sandal."

12:59.559 --> 13:01.359
You know, when I went down to the morgue,

13:01.394 --> 13:03.962
Joel and I...

13:06.065 --> 13:07.799
We were interrupted by the earthquake.

13:07.834 --> 13:09.200
What earthquake?

13:09.235 --> 13:11.970
Why hasn't anyone else felt it?

13:13.239 --> 13:15.340
Anyway, I'm taking it as a sign.

13:15.374 --> 13:16.408
It's not a sign.

13:16.442 --> 13:17.409
- It is.
- No.

13:17.443 --> 13:19.677
That is a sign.

13:27.353 --> 13:28.653
Hi. Excuse me.

13:28.687 --> 13:31.956
Sorry, um, I couldn't help but notice.

13:31.990 --> 13:34.224
Joel 2:31... what does that mean?

13:34.259 --> 13:36.794
"The sun will be turned into darkness"

13:36.828 --> 13:38.429
"and the moon into blood"

13:38.463 --> 13:42.132
"before the great and
terrible day of the Lord comes."

13:44.836 --> 13:47.404
Joel's the apocalypse.

13:47.472 --> 13:48.738
Awesome.

13:51.725 --> 13:53.464
Vida, it's important
you don't flex your neck.

13:53.498 --> 13:55.599
All that's holding your head on right now

13:55.634 --> 13:57.568
are skin, muscle, and some ligaments.

13:57.602 --> 13:59.236
We're gonna put you under now.

13:59.271 --> 14:00.738
Can you count backwards from 100?

14:00.838 --> 14:02.205
You're going to bury me.

14:03.308 --> 14:04.908
Uh, no, because you're not dead.

14:04.976 --> 14:06.477
You hear that beeping sound?

14:06.511 --> 14:08.145
That's... that's your heartbeat.

14:08.212 --> 14:10.213
It's not me.

14:10.281 --> 14:13.650
Vida, you can't go into
a surgery thinking like that.

14:13.717 --> 14:15.418
You have to want to live.

14:17.255 --> 14:18.855
I'm sorry I ignored you earlier.

14:18.923 --> 14:22.159
You didn't want to be seen
talking to a dead person.

14:25.596 --> 14:28.564
I've never had sex. I promise.

14:28.632 --> 14:30.333
Just try to relax.

14:30.401 --> 14:33.068
Is there another way I could be pregnant,

14:33.136 --> 14:35.505
like from a swimming pool?

14:35.572 --> 14:37.607
If you had sex in one, totally.

14:37.675 --> 14:42.011
Uh, or how, uh... how frogs, you know, um...

14:42.078 --> 14:43.712
l-l-like in "Jurassic Park."

14:43.780 --> 14:45.714
Asexual reproduction?

14:45.748 --> 14:46.916
Uh-huh.

14:48.418 --> 14:53.055
Well... parthenogenesis
hasn't been proven in humans.

14:53.123 --> 14:55.291
Maybe I'm the first...

14:55.325 --> 14:56.858
or the second.

14:56.926 --> 14:58.694
Can we talk for a sec?

14:58.728 --> 15:00.094
Right now?

15:00.129 --> 15:02.230
Mm-hmm.

15:02.264 --> 15:03.732
Sure.

15:03.766 --> 15:05.434
We can't do the ultrasound.

15:05.468 --> 15:07.068
Why not?

15:07.102 --> 15:08.437
She's not lying.

15:08.504 --> 15:11.306
She's a virgin. Her hymen's intact.

15:11.374 --> 15:13.842
Dr. Reid? Dr. Reid.

15:13.876 --> 15:16.010
Elisa? Elisa.

15:16.045 --> 15:17.745
Elisa, look at me. What's wrong?

15:17.813 --> 15:19.347
There's a monster in me.

15:19.381 --> 15:22.917
Okay, okay, I'm here. I'm with you, okay?

15:25.821 --> 15:27.288
Okay.

15:27.323 --> 15:28.823
Yeah.

15:30.925 --> 15:32.125
Custom deck?

15:32.193 --> 15:34.261
Seven-layer canadian maple.

15:34.295 --> 15:35.396
Good flex.

15:35.464 --> 15:37.931
And forged titanium trucks, of course.

15:37.966 --> 15:39.066
Of course.

15:39.100 --> 15:41.736
Can you give us a moment, please?

15:41.803 --> 15:44.472
You got a real red aura going
right now, friend.

15:44.506 --> 15:46.639
"Anger is an acid that can do more harm"

15:46.674 --> 15:48.475
"to the vessel in which it is stored"

15:48.509 --> 15:50.510
"than to anything on which it is poured."

15:50.544 --> 15:51.778
Is that from the bible?

15:51.812 --> 15:53.213
It's Mark Twain.

15:53.281 --> 15:55.782
And mind your business, guy.
I'm talking to my son, okay?

15:55.816 --> 15:59.286
I'm around when you need me... Dr. Miller.

15:59.320 --> 16:01.621
Thank you, but I don't need you,

16:01.655 --> 16:03.523
so you just sit here and wait
for your stitches, okay?

16:03.557 --> 16:06.292
Thank you. You come with me.

16:06.326 --> 16:08.461
Your mother is flipping out right now.

16:08.496 --> 16:09.496
What else is new?

16:09.563 --> 16:10.864
She thought you were home in bed.

16:10.898 --> 16:12.432
She didn't even believe you were here.

16:12.466 --> 16:13.933
She had to go up and check your room.

16:13.967 --> 16:16.202
She doesn't care. She has Hank.

16:16.236 --> 16:17.404
I thought you liked him.

16:18.706 --> 16:22.474
Well, she is very upset with you,

16:22.509 --> 16:25.111
and she just needs to calm down
before she talks to you,

16:25.145 --> 16:27.546
so you're going to stay here with me

16:27.614 --> 16:29.882
on the busiest night in recent memory.

16:29.917 --> 16:32.018
- Awesome!
- Not awesome.

16:32.052 --> 16:34.653
You're gonna stay off your
skateboard and out of trouble.

16:34.687 --> 16:36.021
- You understand me?
- Mm.

16:36.055 --> 16:37.122
I beg your pardon?

16:37.156 --> 16:39.124
Yes, father.

16:39.158 --> 16:40.726
Unbelievable.

16:42.995 --> 16:45.497
Hey, guy, can I touch your beard?

16:45.532 --> 16:49.134
It's not mine, little man. It's everybody's.

16:49.201 --> 16:51.437
No, it's not. And don't touch that.

16:53.339 --> 16:56.908
Is there any chance that you
were bitten by a wild animal?

16:56.943 --> 16:57.943
I'm a werewolf.

16:58.010 --> 16:58.977
Open.

16:59.045 --> 17:00.178
W-what are you saying?

17:00.246 --> 17:01.846
Y-you think she has rabies?

17:01.914 --> 17:04.648
Mania, hallucinations,
increased saliva production...

17:04.683 --> 17:06.684
they're all signs of rabies.

17:06.752 --> 17:09.454
It is rare, but it does happen.

17:09.521 --> 17:12.056
Uh, well, she loves the outdoors.

17:12.089 --> 17:14.791
She volunteers
at this place up in Collingwood.

17:14.859 --> 17:16.026
Campfire ministries.

17:16.094 --> 17:20.230
There's hiking, rock climbing, caving.

17:20.265 --> 17:21.432
Nothing bit me.

17:21.467 --> 17:23.935
With a bat, the bite could go undetected.

17:24.002 --> 17:27.037
Test her saliva and hair
follicles, and let's tap her.

17:27.105 --> 17:28.271
What if I bite you?

17:30.875 --> 17:33.077
We are gonna do
what's called a lumbar puncture.

17:33.144 --> 17:35.879
Uh, w-we are? I thought... shouldn't we...

17:35.947 --> 17:36.613
Page Joel?

17:36.681 --> 17:39.183
Page Joel.

17:39.250 --> 17:41.218
- She was frothing at the mouth?
- Yes.

17:41.286 --> 17:43.019
Right, and the vaccine's only effective

17:43.087 --> 17:44.921
if it's given before the symptoms develop.

17:44.989 --> 17:47.190
- Let's hope I'm wrong, then.
- Yeah, you better be.

17:47.257 --> 17:49.359
- If it's this advanced and it is rabies...
- I know.

17:49.426 --> 17:50.560
It's a death sentence.

17:53.631 --> 17:55.298
Hi, Elisa.

17:55.366 --> 17:57.567
So, this should only take a minute.

17:59.769 --> 18:01.371
So, talk to me, guys.

18:01.438 --> 18:03.139
Where's the rest of the wedding party?

18:03.173 --> 18:05.274
We eloped.

18:05.309 --> 18:06.742
You're a smart woman.

18:06.776 --> 18:09.278
- - I don't know. Weddings can be fun.
Whoa.

18:09.346 --> 18:11.080
- What is it?
- It's okay, it's okay.

18:11.115 --> 18:13.016
You know what? Why don't...
why don't you sit over here?

18:13.083 --> 18:15.417
- Have a seat.
- Roberto? Is he okay?

18:15.485 --> 18:16.819
He'll be fine.

18:16.853 --> 18:21.289
Okay, it's important
you don't move, Elisa, please.

18:21.324 --> 18:23.158
- Aah!
- Okay.

18:23.226 --> 18:24.827
- No! I don't want it!
- It's not safe.

18:24.895 --> 18:26.629
- Look at me. Look at me.
- Please stop!

18:26.663 --> 18:28.296
You need to remain completely still,

18:28.331 --> 18:29.798
or we could paralyze you, okay?

18:29.833 --> 18:31.466
Do you understand?

18:33.036 --> 18:35.437
You need to try to slow down your breathing.

18:35.471 --> 18:38.140
I'm right here.

18:38.174 --> 18:39.408
Good job.

18:39.442 --> 18:41.376
You're doing a great job. We're almost done.

18:41.444 --> 18:42.477
We got you.

18:47.450 --> 18:49.651
Great job.

18:55.891 --> 18:58.560
Okay, occipitocervical rods
are secured to the skull plate.

18:58.594 --> 19:00.227
How are my croutons coming, Rian?

19:00.262 --> 19:02.830
Bone grafts are almost ready.

19:05.067 --> 19:07.234
I found the morgue, but I wasn't there.

19:10.305 --> 19:12.206
Nope, you're right here.

19:15.810 --> 19:18.079
Bone graft will go right here.

19:20.115 --> 19:21.181
Okay.

19:24.351 --> 19:26.252
That's not me.

19:32.860 --> 19:35.228
You know, when I'm gluing your head back on,

19:35.262 --> 19:36.997
try not to distract me.

19:37.065 --> 19:39.165
Is he always like this?

19:39.200 --> 19:40.300
So I've heard.

19:40.334 --> 19:41.634
Okay.

19:41.668 --> 19:43.669
Talking to the patient
helps me stay focused.

19:43.704 --> 19:45.838
I was right.

19:45.872 --> 19:48.040
They can't see me, 'cause I'm dead.

19:53.547 --> 19:56.749
Are you married, Dr. Reid?

19:56.783 --> 19:58.050
No.

19:58.118 --> 20:00.586
Well, it's all I've ever wanted.

20:00.621 --> 20:02.688
And now this?

20:02.756 --> 20:04.056
What does it mean?

20:05.892 --> 20:07.559
Just give me a second.

20:07.594 --> 20:08.928
Hey, what's up?

20:08.962 --> 20:10.996
L.P. results back from the lab.
Biochemistry's fine.

20:11.030 --> 20:12.531
You know exactly what I'm gonna say.

20:12.599 --> 20:14.065
I don't think it's psychiatric, Joel.

20:14.100 --> 20:16.635
She's the prime age range for
a psychotic break. You know it.

20:16.702 --> 20:18.403
She doesn't have a family
history of mental illness,

20:18.438 --> 20:19.871
and her white blood cell count is elevated.

20:19.939 --> 20:21.473
Yeah, but only slightly, and that could be

20:21.541 --> 20:23.108
the trauma from the lumbar puncture itself.

20:23.176 --> 20:25.544
I still have to rule out
meningitis, encephalitis,

20:25.612 --> 20:27.779
infectious diseases, an autoimmune reaction.

20:27.813 --> 20:29.781
She needs to be admitted to psych, Alex.

20:29.849 --> 20:31.215
I think it's physiological.

20:31.283 --> 20:33.384
Elisa?

20:34.486 --> 20:35.553
What's going on?!

20:35.621 --> 20:37.455
She's having a seizure.

20:37.523 --> 20:38.589
Grand mal.

20:38.624 --> 20:40.058
Let's get a crash cart just in case.

20:40.126 --> 20:41.726
She'll need 100 milligrams of phenytoin,

20:41.794 --> 20:42.761
no more than 50 a minute.

20:42.828 --> 20:44.862
God is our refuge and strength,

20:44.929 --> 20:48.466
always ready to help in times
of trouble, so we will not fear,

20:48.534 --> 20:50.168
even if earthquakes come

20:50.235 --> 20:52.770
and mountains crumble into the sea.

21:00.188 --> 21:01.588
Another doctor?

21:01.622 --> 21:04.458
Yes. We're trying to figure out
what's wrong with your wife.

21:04.492 --> 21:07.293
Hmm. She had a tonic-clonic seizure.

21:07.362 --> 21:09.929
Okay. What does that mean?

21:09.997 --> 21:12.165
If her brain continues to seize,

21:12.199 --> 21:14.868
it will eventually wear out
and start shutting down.

21:14.902 --> 21:17.203
The seizure proves that whatever it is,

21:17.238 --> 21:19.038
the cause isn't psychiatric.

21:19.106 --> 21:21.741
We should really
test her spinal fluid again.

21:21.775 --> 21:23.576
Are you thinking meningitis?

21:23.643 --> 21:26.045
I'm a neurosurgeon.

21:26.080 --> 21:27.881
I'm always thinking meningitis.

21:27.948 --> 21:30.583
This is a nightmare.

21:30.617 --> 21:33.552
You know, maybe we're not meant
to be together.

21:33.587 --> 21:36.288
- It's a sign.
- No.

21:36.356 --> 21:37.623
It's a mystery.

21:37.657 --> 21:39.692
And you have a team of doctors
working to solve it.

21:39.726 --> 21:40.826
That's what we do.

21:43.563 --> 21:45.931
I-I can barely recognize her.

21:45.965 --> 21:48.567
And I know this isn't her.

21:48.602 --> 21:51.136
She's not a monster.

21:51.170 --> 21:54.072
No. She's not a monster.

21:57.076 --> 21:58.543
She's...

22:01.414 --> 22:04.316
Dr. Reid? What is it?

22:04.350 --> 22:07.519
I just need to go check on something.

22:07.553 --> 22:09.421
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

22:26.305 --> 22:28.172
What are you doing, guy?

22:28.206 --> 22:30.574
I'm not sure where I'm supposed to be.

22:30.608 --> 22:32.977
You're supposed to be in your own bed.

22:33.011 --> 22:34.078
Excuse me.

22:36.048 --> 22:38.983
Excuse me, doctor.
This is the situation...

22:39.017 --> 22:41.985
You know, I had some
real problems with my dad, too.

22:42.053 --> 22:45.522
Real busy guy. Kind of distant, like you.

22:45.557 --> 22:48.224
I... am not distant.

22:48.292 --> 22:51.094
Must be hard to rezone
your life after a divorce.

22:51.162 --> 22:54.130
Used to be you had a family.
Now you just have kids.

22:54.165 --> 22:55.899
I see my kids every chance I get.

22:55.967 --> 22:58.935
I talk to their teachers. I...

22:58.970 --> 23:01.604
Why am I even talking to you about this?

23:01.638 --> 23:03.673
It's kind of funny when you think about it.

23:03.707 --> 23:05.908
Jacob left the house
in the middle of the night,

23:05.943 --> 23:08.011
except he wasn't running away.

23:08.045 --> 23:09.712
He was running towards.

23:09.746 --> 23:12.248
Okay.

23:12.316 --> 23:14.083
All right, smart guy.

23:14.150 --> 23:15.284
What should I do?

23:15.318 --> 23:16.819
You mean what would I do?

23:17.888 --> 23:20.322
There's only one commandment, man.

23:20.357 --> 23:22.792
Yeah, stay in bed.

23:22.860 --> 23:25.027
- Love.
- Seriously.

23:25.095 --> 23:27.997
Don't move, or I'm gonna
have you restrained.

23:28.064 --> 23:30.165
You're not listening, man.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.600
Right.

23:33.703 --> 23:36.038
Well, your surgery went well, Vida.

23:36.106 --> 23:40.142
You should be, uh, up and
walking in a couple of days.

23:45.315 --> 23:46.281
You're not hungry?

23:46.349 --> 23:49.083
My stomach won't digest.

23:51.320 --> 23:54.890
My heart isn't beating.

23:54.957 --> 23:56.725
My head has fallen off.

23:56.759 --> 23:59.360
You really think you're dead, don't you?

24:04.400 --> 24:07.068
Well, um...

24:07.136 --> 24:10.638
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.

24:10.672 --> 24:14.942
If you are dead, I'm the only
person you can talk to.

24:14.976 --> 24:17.578
The dead don't talk.

24:17.612 --> 24:20.447
Oh, they do to me...

24:20.481 --> 24:22.382
ever since I was in a coma.

24:22.417 --> 24:25.085
Maybe you haven't woken up.

24:25.153 --> 24:28.355
Well, that would explain a lot.

24:28.389 --> 24:30.958
But, uh, I am awake,

24:30.992 --> 24:33.627
and I can hear you.

24:35.630 --> 24:38.532
Hey, tell me about the rock.

24:38.599 --> 24:41.634
You have a-a stone you like to hold, right?

24:42.703 --> 24:44.204
How do you know about that?

24:44.238 --> 24:45.805
Mm...

24:45.839 --> 24:47.107
like I said.

24:51.612 --> 24:56.315
You know, when I was 6,
I saw my parents die.

24:58.052 --> 25:03.189
And afterwards...I didn't say
anything for a year.

25:05.425 --> 25:08.127
How did they die?

25:08.161 --> 25:11.197
It was a car accident.

25:17.471 --> 25:23.476
We were skipping stones
at the beach... Val and I.

25:25.412 --> 25:27.646
She wanted to stay.

25:29.582 --> 25:32.985
But I was bored, so we left early.

25:35.121 --> 25:37.089
Car was hit.

25:37.123 --> 25:40.626
I died instantly.

25:40.660 --> 25:43.461
It was a year ago, on our birthday.

25:43.496 --> 25:46.331
You're a twin?

25:46.365 --> 25:50.201
I used to be.

26:05.617 --> 26:07.317
Working late?

26:07.385 --> 26:09.820
I'm a night owl.

26:12.423 --> 26:14.692
Kale chip?

26:14.760 --> 26:16.793
No.

26:16.827 --> 26:18.495
I, um...

26:18.563 --> 26:21.398
I came to talk about Vida.

26:21.466 --> 26:23.534
She say something else to you?

26:23.568 --> 26:25.536
Uh, well, she's convinced she's dead.

26:25.603 --> 26:28.438
She's lost her sister, so
I think it's a coping mechanism.

26:28.506 --> 26:31.608
Once you go into death,
it becomes less frightening.

26:31.676 --> 26:33.409
So I would imagine.

26:33.443 --> 26:37.213
Dr. Murphy warned me you were
pretty weird for a bone guy.

26:37.247 --> 26:40.016
Just give me a diagnosis.

26:40.084 --> 26:42.719
Cotard's syndrome.

26:42.753 --> 26:44.087
Who's what?

26:44.155 --> 26:45.722
Walking corpse syndrome.

26:45.790 --> 26:48.224
It's a delusional disorder

26:48.292 --> 26:49.825
associated with severe depression,

26:49.893 --> 26:52.328
where the patient believes
their body has died.

26:52.396 --> 26:54.063
Is there a treatment for it?

26:54.130 --> 26:55.798
Yeah.

26:55.865 --> 26:58.867
Next step would be
electroconvulsive therapy.

27:03.473 --> 27:04.574
Hi.

27:04.608 --> 27:05.841
Hey, we were just gonna come find you.

27:05.909 --> 27:07.142
Her cerebrospinal fluid

27:07.177 --> 27:09.878
is positive for
anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.

27:09.946 --> 27:11.847
It's exactly what you said it would be.

27:11.915 --> 27:12.948
Her brain is a fireball.

27:13.016 --> 27:14.083
The question is, what's causing it.

27:14.117 --> 27:16.118
I think I know.

27:16.186 --> 27:19.521
Elisa's CT... see that on her coccyx?

27:19.589 --> 27:21.389
Are those bone fragments?

27:21.457 --> 27:22.790
They're teeth.

27:22.858 --> 27:25.360
It's rare. I like it.

27:25.394 --> 27:26.461
The signs were there.

27:26.529 --> 27:28.162
We just weren't reading them correctly.

27:28.231 --> 27:29.497
Elisa was right all along.

27:29.565 --> 27:31.399
There is a monster inside of her.

27:42.864 --> 27:45.633
N-never seen a case quite like this.

27:45.667 --> 27:47.935
It's growing off her coccyx.

27:47.969 --> 27:50.037
I-it's really quite fascinating.

27:50.071 --> 27:51.972
Teratoma comes from the greek word "teras,"

27:52.006 --> 27:53.073
meaning "monster."

27:53.141 --> 27:54.574
Teratomas are these bizarre tumors.

27:54.608 --> 27:56.009
Which contain fully mature cells

27:56.044 --> 27:58.011
from all parts of her body,
including her brain,

27:58.046 --> 28:00.147
which is why she hasn't been acting herself.

28:00.181 --> 28:03.116
They can also trigger
a positive pregnancy test.

28:03.151 --> 28:04.351
Is she gonna be okay?

28:04.385 --> 28:05.852
Shahir?

28:05.886 --> 28:07.454
We're going in now to remove the teratoma.

28:07.488 --> 28:09.589
I'm sorry. This is where we leave you.

28:09.623 --> 28:11.123
Take care of her.

28:26.806 --> 28:29.775
Got you some... stuff.

28:29.809 --> 28:31.743
I'm not hungry.

28:35.115 --> 28:38.417
Okay, well, you can keep them for later.

28:40.720 --> 28:42.855
Tell me something.

28:42.889 --> 28:47.693
As a dad, how am I doing, scale of 1 to 10?

28:47.727 --> 28:50.061
I'm not answering that.

28:52.599 --> 28:56.034
So, not a 10, then.

28:56.068 --> 28:59.404
For what it's worth, I'd have
given me about a 7.

28:59.438 --> 29:02.840
I guess.

29:02.875 --> 29:04.542
Not like I don't feel guilty

29:04.576 --> 29:06.444
about those three points, though.

29:06.479 --> 29:10.315
Guy says you have
the 21st-century disease...

29:10.383 --> 29:12.416
trying to do too many things at once.

29:12.450 --> 29:14.385
Well...

29:14.452 --> 29:17.021
here's hoping that guy
and his high-powered perception

29:17.088 --> 29:20.625
will be released from my care very soon.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.266
You want to talk to me

29:29.334 --> 29:32.202
and tell me why you came down here tonight?

29:32.270 --> 29:36.407
I want to come live with you.

29:36.441 --> 29:40.944
You know that I love you,
and I want you around always.

29:47.151 --> 29:48.384
Maybe I'll talk to your mother.

29:48.452 --> 29:51.054
She'll say no.

29:51.121 --> 29:53.356
She won't be wrong.

29:53.424 --> 29:54.691
You need your own bedroom.

29:54.759 --> 29:55.959
You can't be eating meals

29:56.027 --> 29:58.662
that come from a vending machine.

29:58.696 --> 30:00.597
But I like it at your place.

30:00.665 --> 30:01.730
It's like camping.

30:01.798 --> 30:05.101
You can't camp every night, kiddo.

30:05.169 --> 30:08.104
You do! You camp here.

30:20.283 --> 30:23.318
So far, so good.
Bowel is cleared out of the way.

30:23.352 --> 30:26.021
I can see where
that attachment's coming from.

30:26.056 --> 30:28.156
Are you gonna make the flight?

30:28.191 --> 30:29.758
Maggie told me.

30:29.826 --> 30:32.327
Yes, my father is getting married.

30:32.395 --> 30:34.596
I didn't know he got divorced.

30:34.630 --> 30:36.465
Well, fifth time's a charm, right?

30:36.532 --> 30:38.866
Oh, can feel where it's stuck.

30:38.934 --> 30:40.135
Heard you have a hot date.

30:41.304 --> 30:43.438
Can you help me position this deaver?

30:43.473 --> 30:45.440
Yes, I definitely can.

30:47.676 --> 30:50.044
That was my soon-to-be stepmother.

30:50.079 --> 30:52.379
It's just fascinating.

30:52.414 --> 30:53.781
They keep getting younger.

30:53.816 --> 30:55.583
You know, it's one thing
if she's in her 20s.

30:55.651 --> 30:57.418
Why does she have to be Australian?

30:57.452 --> 30:59.353
It's not funny.

30:59.387 --> 31:00.688
It's a little funny.

31:00.723 --> 31:02.323
- Go get the thing. Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

31:03.626 --> 31:05.693
You should come with me,
sneak into my luggage.

31:05.761 --> 31:08.195
That's why I do yoga...
save money on flights.

31:08.230 --> 31:09.963
How we doing?

31:09.998 --> 31:12.266
We've lost 500 cc of blood so far.

31:12.300 --> 31:13.734
We're keeping up with it.

31:13.768 --> 31:14.868
Okay.

31:14.902 --> 31:16.303
Okay, take that. We ready, guys?

31:16.338 --> 31:18.639
Yep.

31:18.673 --> 31:20.907
Let's lift this out together
very gently, all right?

31:20.942 --> 31:23.043
Don't want spillage
in case of another earthquake.

31:23.077 --> 31:26.579
Wow.

31:26.614 --> 31:28.015
Look at that.

31:29.917 --> 31:32.519
- That is just...
- Wow.

31:32.553 --> 31:35.622
Massive.

31:35.657 --> 31:38.692
So, do you understand
what's gonna happen, Vida?

31:38.726 --> 31:42.662
You're gonna shock my brain
and bring me back to life.

31:42.696 --> 31:44.597
In so many words, yeah.

31:44.632 --> 31:47.534
Like a monster on a slab.

31:47.568 --> 31:49.802
No.

31:49.870 --> 31:51.837
No.

31:51.872 --> 31:54.006
It's not like that.

31:54.041 --> 31:55.408
Okay?

31:55.442 --> 31:57.977
I promise.

31:58.045 --> 31:59.378
You'll be asleep.

31:59.445 --> 32:01.914
You can't hurt me.

32:05.652 --> 32:06.819
Meet me in the morgue.

32:06.887 --> 32:08.487
What?

32:08.521 --> 32:10.890
You know where it is.

32:10.924 --> 32:13.592
I'll be there.

32:16.629 --> 32:18.564
Okay.

32:18.598 --> 32:20.465
We're ready.

32:39.018 --> 32:41.152
Hey. You're here.

32:41.220 --> 32:42.887
I was, uh, starting to worry you wouldn't...

32:42.955 --> 32:44.089
weren't gonna show.

32:44.156 --> 32:45.623
What's happening to me?

32:45.657 --> 32:49.993
It's the ECT, and, uh,
we don't have much time.

32:50.061 --> 32:53.331
It was your sister who died, not you.

32:53.398 --> 32:54.732
You are alive.

32:54.799 --> 32:56.900
What happened wasn't your fault.

32:56.968 --> 32:58.202
She's my other half.

32:58.270 --> 32:59.770
It wasn't your fault.

32:59.804 --> 33:02.673
I can't live without my other half.

33:02.741 --> 33:05.909
I know.

33:05.977 --> 33:07.544
I know the feeling.

33:13.985 --> 33:15.252
Hey, what's-what's...

33:15.319 --> 33:16.620
what's the most alive you've ever felt?

33:16.687 --> 33:18.822
I don't remember.

33:18.890 --> 33:20.123
Try.

33:20.157 --> 33:22.759
My brain won't work.

33:22.793 --> 33:26.463
Uh, what about, um,
with your sister, with, uh, Val?

33:28.633 --> 33:31.434
Riding a roller coaster,
screaming our heads off.

33:31.502 --> 33:34.003
Okay. Let's do it.

33:34.037 --> 33:35.472
Ride a roller coaster?

33:35.506 --> 33:36.839
No, no, no. Scream your head off.

33:36.907 --> 33:37.874
Bad choice of words.

33:37.941 --> 33:41.744
Just... scream, loud as you can.

33:41.779 --> 33:44.781
Just let it out.

33:44.815 --> 33:46.949
Aaaaah!

33:46.984 --> 33:48.017
You're an insane person.

33:48.085 --> 33:49.451
Well, it takes one to know one.

33:49.519 --> 33:51.053
Come on! Scream!

33:52.756 --> 33:54.890
Aaah!

33:54.924 --> 33:57.826
No, I said scream from here!

33:57.860 --> 34:00.095
Come on! Don't just show me your tonsils!

34:00.129 --> 34:03.699
Let it out like you're on a roller coaster!

34:05.968 --> 34:07.403
If I start, I might never stop.

34:07.437 --> 34:08.904
Good!

34:15.577 --> 34:16.710
90 seconds.

34:16.745 --> 34:18.045
She should have stopped seizing by now.

34:18.080 --> 34:19.714
Prep 2 milligrams of midazolam.

34:19.782 --> 34:22.184
If it gets to two minutes,
we have to intervene.

34:28.324 --> 34:36.297
Aaaaaaah!

34:40.768 --> 34:42.870
Something's happening.

34:42.904 --> 34:44.670
Something good?

34:44.706 --> 34:46.672
I'm alive.

34:48.243 --> 34:50.577
Aaaaaaah!

34:50.610 --> 34:55.681
Aaaaaaah!

35:03.090 --> 35:05.525
Do we have any guesses
what the toy inside will be?

35:05.593 --> 35:07.193
I read a case study of a teratoma patient

35:07.261 --> 35:09.796
with a perfectly formed foot in their brain.

35:09.831 --> 35:11.498
The question is, who gets to keep it?

35:11.532 --> 35:15.101
Well, I promised Zach I would
try and get him a tooth, so...

35:15.135 --> 35:17.971
Okay, if we see different types of cells,

35:18.038 --> 35:20.173
it means the teratoma's likely benign.

35:20.241 --> 35:22.075
So, what looks like a bad sign...

35:22.142 --> 35:25.444
- Is actually a good sign.
- Okay.

35:25.512 --> 35:27.213
Ready for the moment of truth?

35:31.752 --> 35:33.051
Is there something wrong with your hand?

35:33.086 --> 35:34.152
Is it still bothering you?

35:37.257 --> 35:39.024
- - You good?
- Yeah.

35:41.261 --> 35:42.395
Thank you.

35:49.302 --> 35:51.836
Ooh... Wow.

35:51.905 --> 35:53.971
Yes.

35:54.039 --> 35:55.606
- - Ooh, that is just...
- Wow.

35:55.640 --> 35:56.874
- - That's disgusting.
- Yeah.

35:58.476 --> 36:00.778
Yeah, that's definitely the most
disgusting thing I've ever seen,

36:00.845 --> 36:02.546
and I've seen
the inside of your refrigerator.

36:02.614 --> 36:05.266
Hey, cut me some slack. That was in med school.

36:05.316 --> 36:06.149
Ohh!

36:06.218 --> 36:07.518
And lookit. It's a brunette.

36:08.853 --> 36:11.254
- Hey, is that a...?
- That's...

36:11.322 --> 36:12.489
An eye.

36:12.557 --> 36:14.892
- Mm-hmm.
- It's an eye.

36:18.162 --> 36:20.831
Once in a blood moon.

36:28.464 --> 36:30.798
How are you feeling?

36:30.866 --> 36:32.267
Tired.

36:32.335 --> 36:35.437
But like myself again.

36:35.505 --> 36:40.108
The last couple days
have been kind of a blur.

36:40.143 --> 36:42.377
Maybe for the best.

36:42.445 --> 36:44.646
So, you don't remember getting married?

36:44.680 --> 36:46.580
That was the monster tumor, too?

36:46.615 --> 36:47.849
Can't believe

36:47.916 --> 36:50.818
you haven't already
called the divorce lawyer.

36:50.853 --> 36:53.420
- Have you?
- No.

36:53.455 --> 36:54.956
But you scared me.

36:54.990 --> 36:57.859
I would have been scared of me, too.

36:57.893 --> 37:00.661
Oh, no, no. That's not what I mean.

37:02.230 --> 37:04.931
Looks like the world's
not gonna end after all.

37:04.966 --> 37:09.970
I prefer not to think
of the apocalypse as a doomsday,

37:10.004 --> 37:11.705
but instead as a renewal.

37:11.739 --> 37:13.674
I like that.

37:13.708 --> 37:15.776
Yeah.

37:26.520 --> 37:28.288
Hi.

37:28.322 --> 37:29.556
Thought I'd check in with you,

37:29.590 --> 37:30.924
see if you're feeling any better.

37:30.958 --> 37:33.259
I'm not gonna complain.

37:34.728 --> 37:37.797
I, um... brought you something.

37:42.503 --> 37:45.071
Thought you might want to have a listen.

37:53.814 --> 37:55.081
Hey.

37:55.115 --> 37:56.682
Light packer, practical and confident...

37:56.717 --> 37:58.084
seasoned traveler.

37:58.118 --> 37:59.785
What... you shrinking my luggage?

37:59.853 --> 38:01.954
You should see what I can do
with baggage.

38:01.988 --> 38:03.989
Hey, I got a question for you.

38:04.024 --> 38:07.158
What's your take
on all this blood-moon madness?

38:07.193 --> 38:09.994
Are you looking to do something crazy?

38:10.029 --> 38:11.963
So...

38:11.997 --> 38:13.898
I have a friend,

38:13.933 --> 38:15.467
and every time we get close,

38:15.501 --> 38:17.736
it just feels like
something gets in the way.

38:17.770 --> 38:20.439
Today, she's blaming the moon...

38:20.506 --> 38:22.073
Okay, maybe a small earthquake.

38:22.141 --> 38:24.342
Mm-hmm.

38:24.376 --> 38:26.044
Uh...

38:26.078 --> 38:27.545
I think she likes you.

38:30.750 --> 38:32.050
Okay.

38:41.560 --> 38:45.062
All right.

38:45.130 --> 38:47.131
Extra chocolate. Those look good.

38:47.198 --> 38:48.499
Ready? Cheers, buddy.

38:53.505 --> 38:54.938
Mmm.

39:53.363 --> 39:55.864
I'm sorry for acting weird earlier.

39:55.932 --> 39:59.568
Charlie, with you, who can tell anymore?

39:59.602 --> 40:00.703
Hmm?

40:02.905 --> 40:04.706
About the other night...

40:04.740 --> 40:05.874
Look...

40:10.546 --> 40:12.881
I get that you're going through
a rough patch.

40:12.949 --> 40:15.350
Whatever is going on with you and Alex,

40:15.384 --> 40:19.019
I... don't need to know.

40:19.054 --> 40:20.888
But as far as you and I are concerned,

40:20.922 --> 40:23.858
I'm not really interested
in being your rock bottom.

40:25.461 --> 40:28.229
You're right. Things could be
a lot-lot better.

40:32.100 --> 40:33.968
But I'm not in a coma anymore.

40:34.002 --> 40:36.636
Yeah, I thought
you proved that the other night.

40:40.675 --> 40:41.976
I'm alive.

40:58.025 --> 41:00.260
Charlie, I want to have a baby.

41:06.868 --> 41:09.702
Mm.

41:27.954 --> 41:29.121
Hey.

41:31.057 --> 41:32.725
I'm Joel, and it's 2:31.

41:35.194 --> 41:37.296
Actually, it's about 6:00.

41:37.363 --> 41:38.931
Did I wake you up?

41:38.965 --> 41:42.534
After seeing that teratoma,
I may never sleep again.

41:42.601 --> 41:46.171
Uh, yeah. That...
that kind of makes two of us.

41:46.239 --> 41:49.774
I thought you were supposed to
be leaving on a jet plane.

41:49.842 --> 41:51.476
Yes.

41:51.544 --> 41:56.148
I was actually on my way
to the airport when I...

41:56.182 --> 41:59.116
heard them talking about the earthquake...

41:59.151 --> 42:00.652
on the radio.

42:02.354 --> 42:05.723
Anyways, I just came back here
to tell you...

42:05.791 --> 42:07.325
we're not crazy.

42:07.392 --> 42:09.694
- There was an earthquake.
- Yeah.

42:09.762 --> 42:11.463
Aren't you glad we're standing in a doorway?

42:13.231 --> 42:14.531
Did they say what the magnitude was?

42:14.599 --> 42:16.733
They said 5.1.

42:19.371 --> 42:21.238
We can do better than that.
