WEBVTT

00:03.373 --> 00:04.692
Hey, Will, what's going on?

00:04.853 --> 00:08.607
Lisa's coming over. We're gonna watch
a couple action-adventure flicks tonight.

00:08.893 --> 00:09.928
Maybe if I get lucky...

00:10.093 --> 00:13.688
...we'll have a little action adventure of
our own. You know what I'm saying?

00:13.853 --> 00:15.969
So, what movies did you rent,
Casanova?

00:16.332 --> 00:18.244
<i>Oh, we got Terminator 2,
Lethal Weapon 3...</i>

00:18.413 --> 00:21.132
<i>...and my personal favorite,
Maniac Cop VII.</i>

00:21.333 --> 00:22.846
Sounds like a romantic evening.

00:23.013 --> 00:24.685
What's Lisa going to do?

00:26.733 --> 00:28.246
Lookie here, lookie here, Spanky.

00:28.413 --> 00:30.483
Now, I'm the man.

00:30.693 --> 00:34.481
You see what I'm saying?
I'm the Man-dingo.

00:34.973 --> 00:39.364
Lisa will watch what I tell her to watch
and she will enjoy it.

00:39.533 --> 00:43.048
And that, as they say, is that.

00:46.053 --> 00:48.567
If you'll excuse me,
it's about to get X-rated in here.

00:48.733 --> 00:50.485
- You know what I mean?
- Hey!

00:51.453 --> 00:54.570
- Hey, baby.
- Hey! What's up girl?

00:54.733 --> 00:56.086
So, what movies did you get?

00:56.293 --> 00:58.170
<i>Terms of Endearment,
Fried Green Tomatoes...</i>

00:58.373 --> 01:00.807
<i>...and The Joy Luck Club.
Shall I get us some hankies?</i>

02:19.373 --> 02:21.011
What are you so happy about?

02:21.173 --> 02:25.086
I just made the weekend reservations
at Palm Springs for me and Lisa.

02:25.453 --> 02:28.206
Lisa? You've been seeing
a lot of her lately.

02:28.373 --> 02:30.489
Oh, yeah, and if it goes
the way I plan...

02:30.653 --> 02:33.929
...I'll be seeing the rest of her
this weekend, you know?

02:34.253 --> 02:35.891
Have you no shame?

02:36.053 --> 02:38.521
Yeah, I'm ashamed of you.

02:39.013 --> 02:41.846
Well, while you're wallowing
in your sordid filth of a life...

02:42.053 --> 02:43.611
...I'll be pursuing some culture.

02:43.773 --> 02:46.082
<i>I bought tickets to The Jeffersons
live on stage.</i>

02:46.253 --> 02:48.244
It includes dinner
with Sherman Hemsley...

02:48.413 --> 02:51.246
...and an autograph picture
of both Lionels.

02:52.293 --> 02:56.764
Swell. That will go great
with your Weezy collectible cups.

02:59.693 --> 03:02.332
Hey, Kool-Aid!

03:05.453 --> 03:07.364
I got your Kool-Aid, all right?

03:07.533 --> 03:10.650
You look so good. You are
gonna be a hit at the Bahamas.

03:10.853 --> 03:12.844
I can't wait to see
your mother down there.

03:13.053 --> 03:15.044
I've been practicing my limbo.

03:17.293 --> 03:20.808
I don't know, Dad,
that limbo bar gets as low as 13 inches.

03:21.053 --> 03:23.613
Wow, Carlton,
you could just walk right under.

03:24.813 --> 03:27.532
Will's shacking up with some girl
in Palm Springs.

03:27.733 --> 03:29.928
You're gonna get it now, mister.

03:30.133 --> 03:31.851
Have fun.

03:33.413 --> 03:35.369
Wait. Is that all
you're gonna say to him?

03:35.533 --> 03:37.091
Am I paying for your little trip?

03:37.253 --> 03:38.925
- Well, no.
- Five up top.

03:39.093 --> 03:40.492
All right.

03:41.413 --> 03:43.529
Master William,
Miss Lisa is here to see you.

03:43.693 --> 03:47.003
Oh, sugar-wugar, now, come on, girl.

03:47.173 --> 03:51.132
Oh, and sir, the limbo bar is set
at three feet when you're ready.

03:51.333 --> 03:53.210
Excellent.

03:54.053 --> 03:57.728
He couldn't make that lying flat
on his back.

03:59.453 --> 04:03.128
Baby, now, say those words
that you know send chills up my spine.

04:03.293 --> 04:05.761
I want you to meet my father.

04:07.893 --> 04:11.932
- What you talking about, girl?
- Well, baby, he and I are very close.

04:12.093 --> 04:15.642
And before you and I get any closer
I think that you should meet him.

04:17.533 --> 04:20.411
That's cool. I'll meet him when we
come back from Palm Springs.

04:20.572 --> 04:21.801
Oh, check it out.

04:21.973 --> 04:24.806
I got us the Wilt Chamberlain suite.

04:25.573 --> 04:29.532
With the electronic scoreboard
over the bed and everything.

04:30.013 --> 04:32.527
Well, before you and I get into
a little one on one...

04:32.733 --> 04:34.928
...you're gonna have to talk
to the head coach.

04:35.533 --> 04:39.082
Well, I'm saying, what if he ain't
playing off the same playbook I am?

04:39.253 --> 04:42.086
Well, then we're gonna
have to call a time-out.

04:42.253 --> 04:45.165
Hey, hey, don't be using my analogy
against me.

04:45.333 --> 04:48.166
Come on, baby. I'm just not
gonna be comfortable going...

04:48.333 --> 04:51.086
...unless I know that my father
approves of you.

04:51.253 --> 04:54.962
As if there's anything
not to approve of.

04:58.413 --> 05:01.325
Oh, not the ears, baby.

05:03.373 --> 05:06.524
All right, I'll talk to your daddy.

05:07.933 --> 05:11.812
Keep doing that, we're gonna have
to dig up his daddy, I'll talk to him too.

05:15.253 --> 05:19.166
Do you have a non-profit book
by African-American photographers?

05:19.333 --> 05:22.450
<i>You mean Songs of My People?</i>

05:22.893 --> 05:25.407
It's a very popular book.

05:25.573 --> 05:28.451
Hey, hey, hey, we're not non-profit.

05:30.093 --> 05:31.970
- Hey.
- Hey, baby.

05:32.133 --> 05:36.206
Hey, hi, hey, hey, hey.
How are you doing? All right.

05:37.053 --> 05:38.486
Sorry I'm late...

05:38.693 --> 05:42.652
...but after I left church, I went down
and read some books to the elderly.

05:43.493 --> 05:45.211
Don't overdo it, honey.

05:45.373 --> 05:46.601
Will, this is my Dad.

05:46.773 --> 05:48.923
- Daddy, this is Will.
- Hello.

05:49.933 --> 05:51.844
How you doing?
Hear that deep voice?

05:52.013 --> 05:53.446
Like James Earl Jones.

05:53.653 --> 05:55.883
"This is CNN."

05:56.373 --> 05:57.806
Well, I've got to get to class.

05:57.973 --> 06:00.441
I want you guys to enjoy each other.

06:01.973 --> 06:05.602
So how's the grub here, Wilbur?

06:06.053 --> 06:10.285
Well, we've only had two
food-related deaths in the past month.

06:10.453 --> 06:11.886
I didn't read about that.

06:12.053 --> 06:14.044
You must be doing
a good job as a manager...

06:14.253 --> 06:16.403
...to keep something like that quiet.

06:16.973 --> 06:20.488
Well, actually my cousin Carlton
is the manager, you know.

06:20.653 --> 06:22.211
I'm pretty much just...

06:22.373 --> 06:24.489
Trying to score with my daughter.

06:25.613 --> 06:27.365
- Sir?
- It's a joke. I'm joking.

06:27.533 --> 06:29.524
I'm pulling your leg.

06:36.773 --> 06:38.411
You see these pictures?

06:38.573 --> 06:40.086
That's my baby.

06:40.253 --> 06:42.687
There's nothing in the world
I won't do for her.

06:42.853 --> 06:44.684
And I really respect that, sir.

06:44.853 --> 06:48.402
And if you don't mind me saying so,
that is a lovely picture of your wife.

06:48.573 --> 06:50.529
I see where Lisa
gets her good looks from.

06:50.733 --> 06:53.122
That's not my wife.
That's my sister-in-law Cecilia.

06:54.053 --> 06:56.123
She's so ugly,
she'd make an onion cry.

06:58.533 --> 07:01.843
Actually, I was being polite.
She is a dog.

07:06.013 --> 07:10.404
Hey, hey, she's so ugly, she could
make a freight train take a dirt road.

07:10.933 --> 07:12.412
It'd be like:

07:16.333 --> 07:18.801
You talking about my family, boy?

07:24.133 --> 07:26.852
Well, no, I just figured you...
You was so...

07:27.013 --> 07:29.971
You know what, I like you.

07:30.133 --> 07:32.124
- You do?
- Yeah.

07:32.333 --> 07:33.561
But I'm out of time.

07:33.733 --> 07:36.008
I've got to fly to San Francisco
on some business.

07:36.173 --> 07:38.892
Why don't we just finish this interview
next week.

07:40.493 --> 07:41.687
Hey, sir.

07:41.853 --> 07:43.445
You know, I actually was hoping...

07:43.613 --> 07:46.002
...that I could get your approval
by this weekend.

07:46.533 --> 07:48.125
What's the rush?

07:48.573 --> 07:52.725
No rush. You know, I just hate
to leave things unfinished, you know.

07:52.893 --> 07:54.724
I'm very meticulous like that.

07:55.013 --> 07:56.571
"Meticulous."

07:56.733 --> 08:01.124
Hey, now that's a word
you don't run into every day.

08:01.453 --> 08:03.728
Say, why don't you fly to Frisco
with me?

08:03.893 --> 08:06.487
You can help me with my vocabulary.

08:07.573 --> 08:10.167
- Fly?
- You ain't scared, are you?

08:11.133 --> 08:14.125
Me, scared?

08:14.333 --> 08:15.925
Hell, no.

08:23.093 --> 08:26.403
Hey, Wilbur, you didn't finish
your Buffalo wings.

08:27.613 --> 08:28.841
I can't eat any more.

08:29.013 --> 08:31.208
Sure you can.
Just put some hot sauce on there.

08:32.013 --> 08:34.082
- No, thank you.
- Boy, what are you saying?

08:34.253 --> 08:36.528
You better put
some Red Rooster on there.

08:37.092 --> 08:38.446
Look...

08:38.653 --> 08:42.009
Hey, do you think you could just
land the plane, you know...

08:42.173 --> 08:44.004
...and I'll just walk back to L.A.

08:44.653 --> 08:48.805
Oh, flying upside down makes you
a little queasy, doesn't it, boy?

08:49.653 --> 08:51.644
Well, no I'm not a...

08:56.253 --> 08:58.244
I'll take that as a yes.

08:58.413 --> 09:00.802
Now, let's talk about my daughter.

09:01.493 --> 09:04.371
Look, it's like I told you
on the ground, man, you know...

09:04.533 --> 09:05.966
...I just like being with her.

09:06.133 --> 09:07.407
Wrong answer.

09:11.813 --> 09:15.442
You might as well admit it, boy,
you're like a squirrel trying to get a nut.

09:15.613 --> 09:16.807
Let me ask you a question.

09:17.013 --> 09:20.608
How many times did you put those
rusty, crusty lips on my daughter?

09:21.693 --> 09:25.925
With all due respect, sir,
I think that's between me and Lisa.

09:26.093 --> 09:27.492
Wrong again.

09:33.093 --> 09:35.653
Okay, you win.

09:35.813 --> 09:38.532
I'll just cancel our weekend
in Palm Springs.

09:38.693 --> 09:41.332
Why the hell would I want to go
to Palm Springs with you?

09:41.973 --> 09:43.565
Not you, Lisa.

09:43.733 --> 09:45.530
You taking my baby girl
to Palm Springs?

09:45.693 --> 09:47.046
Oh, no, no, no.

09:47.213 --> 09:49.124
- Boy, I'm really mad now.
- No, no, no.

09:57.653 --> 09:59.086
The engine's dead.

09:59.253 --> 10:00.811
What?

10:03.733 --> 10:05.451
Yeah.

10:06.773 --> 10:09.651
Oh, so I guess
we're going down, huh?

10:09.813 --> 10:12.691
Faster than a bucket of chicken
at Oprah's.

10:13.893 --> 10:16.248
Oh, so I should probably
just confess...

10:16.413 --> 10:20.326
...all the nasty things
I've done with your daughter, huh?

10:20.493 --> 10:22.643
Especially seeing
as how in any second now...

10:22.813 --> 10:25.691
...we're gonna be splattering
all over those mountains there.

10:26.373 --> 10:28.045
Let me tell you, I'm from Philly...

10:28.213 --> 10:31.922
...you've gotta wake up pretty early in
the morning to get me with some old...

10:37.733 --> 10:39.610
Mr. Adams?

10:46.413 --> 10:48.051
Mr. Adams?

10:49.293 --> 10:51.409
Mr. Adams?

11:21.613 --> 11:23.843
I made it!

11:24.013 --> 11:26.607
I'm alive!

11:28.013 --> 11:30.447
- I can't believe it!
- I can't believe it either.

11:30.613 --> 11:33.207
Your damn chute
wasn't supposed to open.

11:34.853 --> 11:36.844
Your plane wasn't supposed
to crash neither.

11:37.013 --> 11:39.368
I guess you just having
an all-around bad day, huh?

11:39.613 --> 11:41.729
How the hell you land so close
to me?

11:41.893 --> 11:44.726
I guess I'm just lucky.

11:46.973 --> 11:49.646
Mayday. Mayday!

11:49.813 --> 11:53.408
This is Afro-Niner 423.

11:54.333 --> 11:55.812
We've gone down.

11:55.973 --> 11:59.045
Our precise position is somewhere...

11:59.213 --> 12:02.842
...over some trees
and rocks and stuff.

12:03.413 --> 12:06.450
- Give me that thing. Give it here.
- What you gonna do, man?

12:06.613 --> 12:09.286
- What you...? Don't...
- Give it. Give it to me.

12:09.813 --> 12:11.292
You done done it now!

12:11.453 --> 12:13.603
Damn!

12:14.133 --> 12:17.125
Okay, look, look. We just got
to get down from here, man.

12:17.293 --> 12:19.124
Let me tell you
what you gotta do, boy.

12:19.293 --> 12:22.603
You gotta get your "mominimum"
and knock me out of this tree.

12:23.053 --> 12:25.044
Mominimum?

12:26.133 --> 12:28.601
Don't you understand English, boy?
Mominimum.

12:28.773 --> 12:30.570
Knock me out of this damn tree.
Come on!

12:30.733 --> 12:32.644
All right, all right, here.

12:34.533 --> 12:36.444
Get me over. Get me...

12:36.653 --> 12:38.564
All right, here we go.

12:39.573 --> 12:41.768
All right, I got it, I got it, I got it.

12:51.733 --> 12:53.883
I'm Philip Banks.
We got here soon as we could.

12:54.053 --> 12:55.406
Have you found my nephew yet?

12:55.573 --> 12:59.248
Good news. We found the plane.
It's totaled.

12:59.453 --> 13:00.647
What?

13:00.813 --> 13:02.246
That's good news?

13:02.853 --> 13:04.969
See, your nephew wasn't in it.

13:05.173 --> 13:06.288
Well, where is he?

13:06.533 --> 13:11.163
If I knew that, I'd be working
for the Psychic Friends Network.

13:11.693 --> 13:15.288
Look, that is my boyfriend
and my father out there.

13:15.773 --> 13:19.527
So you're gonna be twice
as upset if they're dead, huh?

13:21.573 --> 13:25.566
Now, you listen here, Mr. Park-Ranger-
Psychic-Friends-Network-freak.

13:25.733 --> 13:27.883
You get out there
and find my cousin now!

13:28.053 --> 13:29.452
Ashley. Ashley, get over here.

13:29.613 --> 13:32.002
Don't worry, we've got
the best in modern equipment.

13:32.173 --> 13:35.210
I'll send out a search party
immediately.

13:35.573 --> 13:39.964
Look, a party sounds like a lot of fun,
but can we please find Will first?

13:43.253 --> 13:44.481
Civilization!

13:44.653 --> 13:47.690
Two backpacks and, look!
A broken radio.

13:47.853 --> 13:51.562
All we got to do is stay here
until these guys come back.

13:54.053 --> 13:55.850
They are back.

13:56.053 --> 13:57.725
They are?

13:58.093 --> 14:00.448
Where? Where?

14:00.613 --> 14:02.205
This is our stuff!

14:02.373 --> 14:03.726
Oh, I don't believe this.

14:03.893 --> 14:08.011
We wasted four hours
traveling around this stupid mountain.

14:08.173 --> 14:09.845
Why don't you quit bellyaching...

14:10.013 --> 14:12.686
...and try to come up
with some ideas of your own.

14:12.893 --> 14:16.442
Oh, well, maybe I'll just do that.

14:20.573 --> 14:22.450
Okay, okay, okay.

14:22.613 --> 14:25.764
All right, the sun sets
in the west, right?

14:25.973 --> 14:27.565
Okay. All right.

14:27.773 --> 14:32.085
And moss only grows
on the north side of the trees.

14:32.253 --> 14:35.051
Stop spouting all that witchcraft.

14:35.813 --> 14:37.451
All we got to do is just stay put.

14:37.653 --> 14:40.042
I'm sure they're out there
looking for me.

14:40.253 --> 14:41.891
Not if they know you.

14:43.333 --> 14:44.846
You know what, boy?

14:45.053 --> 14:47.044
You've got a double order of lip.

14:47.253 --> 14:50.529
And I got a short stack of patience.

14:51.413 --> 14:54.849
What the hell does that mean?

14:55.493 --> 14:58.849
Put up your hands. I'm gonna
give you a good butt-whipping.

15:00.253 --> 15:01.606
Look.

15:01.813 --> 15:05.965
Please, you're like
479 years old, right?

15:06.133 --> 15:08.601
And I ain't trying to be out here
fighting no old man.

15:08.773 --> 15:11.412
Oh, fine, that makes it easier for me.

15:15.453 --> 15:18.650
- You all right, man? You all right?
- Old man, huh? I've got you now.

15:18.853 --> 15:20.844
Oh, young blood. Yeah, young blood.

15:21.013 --> 15:23.288
- Get off me, man.
- Yeah, young blood.

15:27.573 --> 15:29.245
What's that?

15:30.813 --> 15:33.532
I don't know. Coyote?

15:33.933 --> 15:35.685
What do they eat?

15:40.253 --> 15:42.164
One of those?

15:44.653 --> 15:46.291
What is taking so long?

15:46.493 --> 15:48.324
You have got to find my father.

15:48.493 --> 15:51.246
Don't worry.
Ranger Franklin's our best tracker.

15:51.413 --> 15:54.405
He never comes back empty-handed.

15:54.573 --> 15:56.131
Oh, this is a tragedy.

15:56.333 --> 15:58.972
Don't worry, Carlton.
I'm sure everything's gonna be okay.

15:59.133 --> 16:03.411
<i>Okay? I'm missing The Jeffersons
live on stage.</i>

16:03.573 --> 16:07.771
Right now I bet George is calling
somebody a jive turkey.

16:08.973 --> 16:10.486
What are you complaining about?

16:10.693 --> 16:13.127
This is hardly the way I wanted
to spend my weekend.

16:13.293 --> 16:16.968
Sitting around in some dusty
old shack waiting for Will to show up.

16:18.053 --> 16:20.521
Man, it's tough finding people
in the woods.

16:20.733 --> 16:25.488
- We'll try again in the morning.
- Well, no hurry.

16:28.733 --> 16:31.247
Look, my nephew is a city boy.

16:31.413 --> 16:33.722
I'm worried he might not survive
in the woods.

16:33.933 --> 16:36.447
- Oh, where's he from?
- West Philadelphia.

16:36.653 --> 16:38.723
Oh, don't worry.
If he can survive there...

16:38.893 --> 16:42.727
...a couple of snakes and bears
aren't gonna bother him.

16:55.773 --> 16:56.888
What are you doing?

16:57.773 --> 17:00.162
What's it look like?
I'm blowing on the embers.

17:00.373 --> 17:02.011
You're blowing the fire out, man.

17:02.733 --> 17:05.247
Look, relax, I got an idea.

17:05.413 --> 17:07.165
What are you doing?

17:08.333 --> 17:09.527
Just stand back, please.

17:09.733 --> 17:11.564
What are you doing
with my Red Rooster?

17:15.613 --> 17:17.410
Damn!

17:21.453 --> 17:23.603
And that was just the mild.

17:33.333 --> 17:34.891
Man.

17:35.933 --> 17:38.322
Look at those stars.

17:38.573 --> 17:40.723
You don't see them like that
back in the city.

17:40.933 --> 17:44.050
Yeah, too much light.

17:45.853 --> 17:49.846
You know, being out here in nature...

17:50.013 --> 17:52.811
...two guys against the elements...

17:52.973 --> 17:57.888
...it's like guys just naturally kind
of bond with each other, you know?

17:58.253 --> 18:01.928
You come together
through a tough situation.

18:02.573 --> 18:05.326
Actually start to like each other.

18:06.333 --> 18:08.563
That ain't happening with us.

18:12.133 --> 18:13.930
Not even a little.

18:20.813 --> 18:23.771
Man, look at that moon.

18:42.293 --> 18:44.443
Hey, what you know
about some jazz, boy?

18:44.613 --> 18:47.605
Oh, man, my grandma used to play
Ella all the time.

18:47.813 --> 18:50.532
Ella, Sarah, Thelonius, Miles, Bert.

18:50.733 --> 18:53.088
Oh, man, those were the days.

18:53.893 --> 18:55.565
Before the music died.

18:55.773 --> 18:58.492
Hey, yeah, you can stop there.
The music ain't died.

18:58.653 --> 19:02.009
Now, you got Guru, Diggable Planets,
A Tribe Called Quest.

19:02.213 --> 19:04.169
The defense rests.

19:04.773 --> 19:08.448
No, I'm telling you, they got a nice
blend of the old school with the new.

19:09.093 --> 19:10.367
Lisa likes it.

19:10.533 --> 19:11.966
Lisa listens to jazz?

19:12.173 --> 19:16.132
Oh, man, we listen to jazz every time
when we try to get in the mood...

19:18.013 --> 19:20.083
Is that Orion the Hunter?

19:20.253 --> 19:21.891
Look at that.

19:22.293 --> 19:24.568
You know, Will, about Lisa...

19:25.573 --> 19:27.928
...sometime I am a little
overprotective of her.

19:29.373 --> 19:32.331
But she's my baby girl.

19:32.493 --> 19:36.372
Heck, she's all I got now
that I lost my plane.

19:38.413 --> 19:40.722
I'm saying, I mean,
I can dig that and everything.

19:40.893 --> 19:43.885
- But don't you care what she wants?
- Nope.

19:44.733 --> 19:47.486
Put some more hot sauce on the fire.
I'm gonna go on to bed.

20:07.213 --> 20:09.204
I mean, I always found it
so incredible...

20:09.373 --> 20:12.490
...that only I could prevent
forest fires.

20:12.653 --> 20:15.565
I mean, that's so much responsibility.

20:15.733 --> 20:18.247
I really should be out there
looking for your cousin.

20:18.413 --> 20:22.486
Don't worry. Will likes to sleep in.

20:24.813 --> 20:27.373
- Will!
- Oh, thank God you're all right.

20:29.613 --> 20:32.173
The pool house wouldn't have
been the same without you.

20:32.333 --> 20:34.244
Hey, thanks a lot, Carlton.

20:34.413 --> 20:37.007
There, I said it. You happy?

20:38.333 --> 20:39.846
Will, where's my father?

20:40.053 --> 20:42.851
- Hey, it's all right, baby, he is fine.
- But what happened?

20:43.053 --> 20:46.011
Well, you know, we had a little
engine trouble and we went down.

20:46.173 --> 20:48.562
But it was the best thing
could have happened to us.

20:48.733 --> 20:51.406
Yeah, we landed kind of in this
wooded glade, you know...

20:51.573 --> 20:53.404
...near this bubbling brook.

20:53.573 --> 20:55.404
Kind of looked like
the beer commercials.

20:55.613 --> 20:58.081
Except there wasn't
no naked honeys.

20:58.453 --> 21:00.887
There wasn't no beer.
Oh, but you know what?

21:01.053 --> 21:03.772
I don't know
if it was the beauty of the area...

21:03.973 --> 21:06.806
...or just being outdoors,
but we kind of bonded.

21:07.013 --> 21:08.526
Why didn't he come back with you?

21:08.733 --> 21:10.644
Look, I could not tear him away.

21:10.813 --> 21:14.203
I told him we could walk down this
brook, take us back to civilization.

21:14.413 --> 21:16.244
But he said,
"No, you go on without me...

21:16.413 --> 21:19.325
...I wanna stay here
and be at one with nature."

21:19.493 --> 21:21.165
You can't be at one when you two.

21:21.333 --> 21:23.244
- So I jetted.
- Really?

21:23.453 --> 21:26.490
You know what? I'm telling you,
your father is a changed man.

21:26.653 --> 21:29.406
He said we should go to Palm Springs
and enjoy ourselves.

21:29.613 --> 21:31.524
You mean he actually said
that we could go?

21:31.693 --> 21:33.649
He insisted.

21:34.413 --> 21:37.405
Now that you're safe, I can still catch
my flight to the Bahamas.

21:37.613 --> 21:40.081
Come on, everybody,
let's go, we're out of here.

21:49.573 --> 21:52.212
Where's that boy with that firewood?

21:53.293 --> 21:54.408
Wilbur!

21:56.973 --> 21:58.691
Outside is a trail of hot sauce.

21:58.853 --> 22:01.048
Light a match, take you right to him.

22:06.053 --> 22:09.728
Wilbur!
Robin Hood, are you around here?

22:11.173 --> 22:13.050
Anybody!

22:13.413 --> 22:15.643
Red Rooster?
Anybody, give me a hand. Squirrel!

22:15.813 --> 22:18.691
I need...
Give me a piece of cheese, I'm hungry.

22:19.893 --> 22:22.612
Little Red Riding Hood,
where are you?

22:23.093 --> 22:24.526
Wilbur!

22:24.693 --> 22:27.730
Hey! They leaving me out here
by myself. I'm scared.

22:27.893 --> 22:29.929
We need some more people,
come on in.

22:30.093 --> 22:32.482
The Three Bears, where are you?

22:32.653 --> 22:34.609
- Help me, somebody.
- John. The show's over.

22:34.813 --> 22:36.804
- Help me, please. Where are you?
- John.

22:36.973 --> 22:38.611
You can stay out here if you want.

22:38.853 --> 22:42.163
Wilbur!
What the hell happened to everything?
