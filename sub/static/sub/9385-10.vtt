WEBVTT

00:01.543 --> 00:05.005
It seems today
that all you see

00:05.088 --> 00:08.550
Is violence in movies
and sex on TV

00:08.634 --> 00:11.929
But where are those good
old-fashioned values

00:12.012 --> 00:14.681
On which we used to rely?

00:14.765 --> 00:18.143
Lucky there's a family guy

00:18.227 --> 00:21.688
Lucky there's a man who
positively can do

00:21.772 --> 00:23.190
All the things
that make us

00:23.273 --> 00:25.192
Laugh and cry

00:25.275 --> 00:29.863
He's...
a... fam... ily... guy!

00:33.033 --> 00:34.368
( sighs )

00:34.451 --> 00:36.245
Peter, this is ridiculous.

00:36.328 --> 00:38.121
I know you're upset
about losing your job

00:38.205 --> 00:40.123
but you've been sitting
on that couch for two weeks.

00:40.207 --> 00:41.959
I have not, Lois.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.961
He's right. It's actually been
more like, uh... ( grunts )

00:44.044 --> 00:45.045
Yeah, 13 days.

00:45.128 --> 00:46.964
You at least have
to do something

00:47.047 --> 00:48.590
other than sitting
there eating.

00:48.674 --> 00:49.842
All right, all right.

00:49.925 --> 00:51.760
Brian, let's go
for a walk.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.062
( crying )

01:02.145 --> 01:03.730
Meg, sweetheart, what's wrong?

01:03.814 --> 01:05.983
My life, that's
what's wrong!

01:06.066 --> 01:07.734
I was totally
humiliated

01:07.818 --> 01:09.361
at school today.

01:09.444 --> 01:10.445
Okay, we're
going to do

01:10.529 --> 01:12.281
a little informal
survey here, kids.

01:12.364 --> 01:13.907
Would those of you
who are going away

01:13.991 --> 01:16.660
for spring break please move
to the left of the room?

01:18.829 --> 01:20.914
Oigan! ¿¿Quienes que van
a "Spring Break" pasen

01:20.998 --> 01:22.708
a la izquierda, por favor?

01:24.918 --> 01:26.336
Oh, Meg, what
do those kids know?

01:26.420 --> 01:28.130
They know how to
have a good time.

01:28.213 --> 01:29.214
Well, so do we.

01:29.339 --> 01:30.340
I'll tell you what.

01:30.424 --> 01:31.717
How about you
and I have

01:31.800 --> 01:33.177
our own little
spring break?

01:33.260 --> 01:34.761
We'll go to that
fancy new spa

01:34.845 --> 01:36.722
that just opened up
in Warwick.

01:36.805 --> 01:39.433
Massages and facials,
ah! It'll be great.

01:39.516 --> 01:40.809
What do you say?

01:40.893 --> 01:43.020
Well, I guess it couldn't
be worse than last year

01:43.103 --> 01:44.771
when we all went
to Sea World.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.737
And how long has
this been going on?!

01:53.488 --> 01:54.531
( sighs )

01:54.615 --> 01:55.699
You know,
Lois is right.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.242
I've been out
of work too long.

01:57.326 --> 01:59.036
Well, I think you should
find something

01:59.119 --> 02:00.162
you really enjoy doing.

02:00.245 --> 02:02.039
Take those guys out there,
for example.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.165
Where?

02:06.251 --> 02:07.669
Oh, yeah, now, that's a job.

02:07.753 --> 02:09.505
Fresh sea air, working outside.

02:09.588 --> 02:12.341
That's how a real New England
man makes a living.

02:12.424 --> 02:13.550
Well, maybe
that's something

02:13.634 --> 02:14.676
to think
about, Peter.

02:14.760 --> 02:15.802
What's that, Daddy?

02:15.886 --> 02:16.929
Well, that's
Mercury, Jake

02:17.012 --> 02:18.305
the planet closest
to the sun.

02:18.388 --> 02:19.890
What it's doing
down here by the wharf

02:19.973 --> 02:21.016
I haven't the foggiest

02:21.099 --> 02:22.643
but we should probably
ask a scientist.

02:22.726 --> 02:24.353
I'm a guy,
you jackass!

02:25.854 --> 02:28.190
Ah, yeah, that feels good.

02:28.273 --> 02:30.817
Chris, don't forget
to mist under his chins.

02:30.901 --> 02:32.194
( gasps )

02:32.277 --> 02:34.988
Oh, boy, Lois,
it's a real mess down there.

02:35.072 --> 02:36.657
I'm afraid I'm not going
to be able to do this

02:36.740 --> 02:38.033
in the time
I quoted you earlier.

02:38.116 --> 02:39.993
Chris, shut the hose off
for a second.

02:40.077 --> 02:42.287
Everybody, I have
an announcement.

02:42.371 --> 02:45.249
I am going to drop this weight
and rejoin the workforce.

02:45.332 --> 02:48.335
I have decided to become
a professional fisherman.

02:48.418 --> 02:49.503
What? Why a fisherman?

02:49.586 --> 02:50.879
It makes perfect
sense, Lois.

02:50.963 --> 02:53.298
You know how much time
I've spent on the ocean.

02:53.382 --> 02:55.551
Wilson!

02:55.634 --> 02:58.303
What are we going to do now?!

02:58.387 --> 03:00.556
Wilson!

03:00.639 --> 03:01.890
Wilson!

03:01.974 --> 03:03.684
My name is Voit,
dumb ass!

03:03.767 --> 03:05.102
Hello, Doreen?

03:05.185 --> 03:07.229
Yeah, I'm still over
at the Griffin job.

03:07.312 --> 03:10.065
Um, listen, tell Walter
I'm not going to be able

03:10.148 --> 03:12.192
to make it
to the construction site.

03:12.276 --> 03:13.569
So, um, I don't know--

03:13.652 --> 03:16.280
have him send Frank
or Glen or Harelip Steve.

03:16.363 --> 03:18.448
I know, it creeps me out, too.

03:20.576 --> 03:22.786
So you think I can find
a boat here, huh, Joe?

03:22.870 --> 03:24.079
Oh, yeah.
You wouldn't believe

03:24.162 --> 03:25.789
what we confiscate
from these crooks.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.916
Welcome. We open today's bidding

03:28.000 --> 03:30.419
with this pair of panties
confiscated from a prostitute.

03:30.502 --> 03:31.545
50 bucks!

03:31.628 --> 03:33.005
She had 9 S.T.D.s.

03:33.088 --> 03:34.965
45 bucks.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.508
And when we caught her,
she wet herself.

03:36.592 --> 03:38.302
50 bucks.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.053
Excuse me.

03:40.137 --> 03:42.514
Are you going to sell anything
that's not gross?

03:42.598 --> 03:44.183
And now our next item.

03:44.266 --> 03:46.059
Please direct your attention
to this photo of a beautiful

03:46.143 --> 03:47.144
40-foot fishing boat.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.395
Oh, man, that's perfect.

03:48.478 --> 03:49.688
$12,000.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.440
-$13,000.
-$25,000.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.985
Sold for $25,000.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.069
Yes!

03:56.153 --> 03:57.154
Aw, crap!

03:57.237 --> 03:58.238
Thanks.

03:58.322 --> 04:00.324
And now the actual boat itself.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.825
Do I have an opening bid for...

04:01.909 --> 04:02.951
$50,000.

04:03.035 --> 04:04.912
Sold for $50,000.

04:04.995 --> 04:06.663
Good for you, Peter.

04:06.747 --> 04:07.956
( wood clacking )

04:10.584 --> 04:13.837
Congratulations. You've just
bought yourself a cursed boat.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.589
-Cursed?
-The last captain

04:15.672 --> 04:17.007
of that vessel lost his life

04:17.090 --> 04:18.383
and it weren't no accident.

04:18.467 --> 04:20.093
His name was Salty

04:20.177 --> 04:22.012
and he was devoured
by Daggermouth

04:22.095 --> 04:23.555
the man-eating bluefish.

04:23.639 --> 04:25.015
You want to buy that boat?

04:25.098 --> 04:26.475
Go ahead, take it

04:26.558 --> 04:29.478
but don't expect me to fish
your dead body from an angry sea

04:29.561 --> 04:30.812
that gave you fair warning.

04:30.896 --> 04:34.024
Are you up
for bids, too?

04:34.107 --> 04:36.068
You are just precious.

04:38.153 --> 04:39.947
Are you going
to miss me?

04:40.030 --> 04:41.990
Only until I go
to the newsstand

04:42.074 --> 04:43.367
and buy a Hustler.

04:43.450 --> 04:44.660
( both giggle )

04:44.743 --> 04:46.495
All right, I left you
the number for the spa.

04:46.578 --> 04:47.663
See you in a few days.

04:47.746 --> 04:49.248
Not if I strangle myself

04:49.331 --> 04:50.832
with a seaweed wrap
and die.

04:50.916 --> 04:52.084
( chuckles)

04:52.167 --> 04:53.252
You are dark!

04:55.420 --> 04:58.215
Uh, Peter, you still haven't
told me how you expect

04:58.298 --> 04:59.424
to pay for that boat.

04:59.508 --> 05:00.676
Don't worry, Brian.

05:00.759 --> 05:01.844
There's got to be
a hundred banks

05:01.927 --> 05:02.970
that'll give me a loan.

05:04.721 --> 05:06.098
Oh, wow, so you can
really give me loan?

05:06.181 --> 05:07.432
I sure can.

05:07.516 --> 05:09.893
You see, Mr. Griffin,
what sets us apart from other banks

05:09.977 --> 05:11.520
is that other banks
are banks.

05:11.603 --> 05:13.105
Now, I trust you
have collateral.

05:13.188 --> 05:14.898
Um... I got three kids.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.066
( chuckles )

05:16.149 --> 05:17.985
I'll take 'em.
Just kidding.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.737
Or maybe I'm not.
Sign this.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.447
Here you go.
Good luck.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.494
So, what do you want
on your thigh?

05:27.578 --> 05:28.871
I want a skull.

05:28.954 --> 05:30.622
Okay, well, I can draw
Kermit the Frog.

05:30.706 --> 05:32.374
How about a nice
Kermit the Frog?

05:32.457 --> 05:33.667
No, I want a skull.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.127
Okay, well, I'm
going to go ahead

05:35.210 --> 05:36.420
and do Kermit the Frog.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.465
Mom, this
is so lame.

05:40.549 --> 05:42.259
Come on, Meg,
try to have fun.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.178
I promise after
a few days here

05:44.261 --> 05:46.305
you won't even remember
the word spring break.

05:46.388 --> 05:47.389
( sighs )

05:47.472 --> 05:49.057
How about some TV?

05:49.141 --> 05:53.145
This is MTV and we're rocking
at spring break.

05:53.228 --> 05:56.315
Hey, this is VH1 and we're
rocking at spring break.

05:56.398 --> 06:00.652
...leaving thousands injured.
For CNN, I'm Bernard Shaw.

06:00.736 --> 06:02.905
Keeping it real and kicking ass
at spring break!

06:02.988 --> 06:04.489
Woo!

06:04.573 --> 06:06.450
( sighs )

06:06.533 --> 06:08.118
There she is, boys

06:08.202 --> 06:12.164
the S.S. More Powerful than
Superman, Batman, Spiderman

06:12.247 --> 06:13.665
And The Incredible Hulk
Put Together.

06:13.749 --> 06:15.292
Yes, she's a fine vessel.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.418
Welcome to the wharf.

06:16.502 --> 06:17.669
The name's Hennessey.

06:17.753 --> 06:18.754
Hi, there. Peter Griffin.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.088
My friends call me
Peter for short.

06:20.172 --> 06:22.174
I'll let you in
on a little secret, neighbor.

06:22.257 --> 06:25.469
The best fishing is
at latitude 42, longitude 71.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.221
Keep that to yourself.

06:27.304 --> 06:28.305
Oh, wow, thanks.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.681
Hey, I'll see you, fellas.

06:29.765 --> 06:31.058
I got some fish to catch.

06:34.520 --> 06:38.190
Ah, let's see...
"latitude 42, longitude 71."

06:38.273 --> 06:41.360
This is it. What the hell?

06:41.443 --> 06:43.904
Papa, he killed Mordecai,
the dancing Yiddish clown.

06:43.987 --> 06:45.072
Stop crying.

06:45.155 --> 06:47.366
You just became a man,
now act like one.

06:47.449 --> 06:49.034
Hey, Hennessey,
what's the big idea

06:49.117 --> 06:51.203
sending me
to that bar mitzvah?

06:51.286 --> 06:53.372
'Cause I don't like you
and I don't like your face.

06:53.455 --> 06:54.831
We don't need
any more fishermen

06:54.915 --> 06:56.083
crowding up this wharf.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.167
Oh, well, fine, Hennessey.

06:57.251 --> 06:58.460
You want an enemy,
you've got one.

06:58.544 --> 06:59.711
Fine!

07:01.463 --> 07:03.382
( grunts ) There we are.

07:03.465 --> 07:06.635
So, Steve, you ever think
of growing a mustache?

07:11.557 --> 07:13.058
Nice fish you got there, Griffin.

07:13.141 --> 07:14.142
What are you selling?

07:14.226 --> 07:15.477
Your bait?

07:15.561 --> 07:18.355
Um, nice face, Hennessey.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.732
Yes! Me one, you zero.

07:20.816 --> 07:21.900
Hey!

07:24.736 --> 07:26.446
Wow. So, how
do you do it?

07:26.530 --> 07:28.240
Oh, you're very nice to ask.

07:28.323 --> 07:30.826
Well, first I hang
the old worm out there.

07:30.909 --> 07:32.494
They usually go for it.

07:32.578 --> 07:33.829
So, I jerk them
around a little

07:33.912 --> 07:35.038
they fight for a while

07:35.122 --> 07:36.957
and then they just lay back
and accept it.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.375
How about we get
together later?

07:38.458 --> 07:39.501
Um, okay.

07:39.585 --> 07:41.003
( laughing)

07:41.086 --> 07:42.254
What the hell?

07:42.337 --> 07:43.422
Oh, damn it.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.049
( car door slams shut )

07:46.133 --> 07:48.010
( gasps )

07:48.093 --> 07:49.511
Hey, what's going on here?

07:49.595 --> 07:51.221
Peter, did you read
the fine print

07:51.305 --> 07:52.431
on this
loan contract?

07:52.514 --> 07:53.682
Um, if by read

07:53.765 --> 07:57.019
you mean "imagined
a naked lady," then, yes.

07:57.102 --> 07:58.187
Peter, listen.

07:58.270 --> 07:59.646
The bank's taking
all our stuff.

07:59.730 --> 08:00.731
And according to this

08:00.814 --> 08:02.482
if you don't pay
them within 48 hours

08:02.566 --> 08:03.775
they get the house, too.

08:03.859 --> 08:06.570
Oh, boy! I get to go live
at the bank!

08:10.282 --> 08:11.867
Meg, did I
ever tell you

08:11.950 --> 08:14.203
that if you're
on birth control

08:14.286 --> 08:16.079
and you take
an antibiotic

08:16.163 --> 08:17.581
it makes it not work?

08:17.664 --> 08:19.458
Because no
one told me.

08:19.541 --> 08:20.792
( laughing )

08:20.876 --> 08:22.669
I thought you
should know.

08:22.753 --> 08:24.046
Look, Mom, I don't
really feel like

08:24.129 --> 08:25.255
talking right now, okay?

08:25.339 --> 08:26.965
Fine. I just
don't understand

08:27.049 --> 08:28.926
why we had to leave
the spa so early.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.385
Look, I just want to go home

08:30.469 --> 08:33.222
and spend the next three days
in solitary confinement

08:33.305 --> 08:34.389
where I belong.

08:34.473 --> 08:36.058
Well, I tried.

08:48.737 --> 08:50.739
MEG:
Mom, what the hell

08:50.822 --> 08:52.157
are we doing here?

08:52.241 --> 08:54.284
This is where you wanted to be,
right, honey?

08:54.368 --> 08:55.994
Yeah, but not with you.

08:56.078 --> 08:57.746
Hey, did you hear
what happened

08:57.829 --> 08:59.164
to that dude
from U. Mass?

08:59.248 --> 09:01.792
He got so drunk he fell
off his hotel balcony.

09:01.875 --> 09:02.876
He's in a coma.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.920
Oh, man, I want
to party with him.

09:05.003 --> 09:06.588
You know it!
Yeah!

09:06.672 --> 09:08.882
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Woo! Woo! Woo!

09:08.966 --> 09:11.176
Hey, look,
Meg made it, you guys.

09:11.260 --> 09:13.428
Yeah, and she brought
her mommy.

09:13.512 --> 09:14.555
( all laugh )

09:14.638 --> 09:16.098
Oh, my God.

09:16.181 --> 09:18.475
Come on, Meg, get
out of the car.

09:18.559 --> 09:19.685
Like the kids say

09:19.768 --> 09:21.562
"Up your nose
with a rubber hose."

09:21.645 --> 09:23.939
Ha, ha, ha. Whoo!

09:25.482 --> 09:26.567
Hey, look, everybody

09:26.650 --> 09:28.235
it's Spuds McKenzie.

09:28.318 --> 09:29.319
( yelling )

09:29.403 --> 09:31.071
( dog growling )

09:31.154 --> 09:32.489
( yelling )

09:32.573 --> 09:34.283
Well, that's the last
of the furniture.

09:34.366 --> 09:35.576
( sighs )

09:35.659 --> 09:37.411
No TV. I miss
my friends.

09:37.494 --> 09:39.162
John Ritter and
Florence Henderson

09:39.246 --> 09:40.414
and Alfonso Ribeiro.

09:40.497 --> 09:42.374
Is he the guy
from Silver Spoons?

09:42.457 --> 09:45.210
Um, uh... no, he was on
French Prince of Bel Air.

09:45.335 --> 09:46.336
Fresh Prince.

09:46.420 --> 09:47.754
Fresh Prince of Bel Air

09:47.838 --> 09:49.214
but, you know, I don't
know if was also on--

09:49.298 --> 09:50.299
Hey, Alfonso.
Yeah?

09:50.382 --> 09:52.259
-Were you on Silver Spoons?
-Yes, I was.

09:52.342 --> 09:53.343
Oh, there you go.

09:55.596 --> 09:57.139
Come on,
just a little higher, honey.

09:57.222 --> 09:59.600
Mom, I don't think I can...
( choking )

09:59.683 --> 10:00.726
Hey, who's holding Lois?

10:00.809 --> 10:01.810
I don't know.

10:01.894 --> 10:03.103
Some dude named Mel.

10:03.187 --> 10:04.229
This is Carson Daly

10:04.313 --> 10:06.440
and we're live here
at Spring Break.

10:06.523 --> 10:08.942
Who wants to party?!

10:09.026 --> 10:11.445
Okay, one, two, three,
four, five.

10:11.528 --> 10:14.072
Okay, we're going to need
cake and juice for 14 people.

10:14.156 --> 10:16.116
All right,
now let's go to Tom Green

10:16.200 --> 10:18.577
who's going to do something
really outrageous.

10:18.660 --> 10:21.455
Does anyone out there
like me yet?

10:21.538 --> 10:23.248
Can I stop this?

10:25.792 --> 10:28.295
Hey, what the hell
are you doing in my house?

10:28.378 --> 10:29.463
Your house?

10:29.546 --> 10:30.547
This is my house.

10:30.631 --> 10:32.424
My wife and I bought
it from the bank.

10:32.508 --> 10:35.052
But I still got another day
to pay back the loan.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.553
The bank said it
wouldn't matter

10:36.637 --> 10:38.096
because you're a fat,
deadbeat loser.

10:38.180 --> 10:39.473
Fat, deadbeat loser?

10:39.556 --> 10:42.267
Well, sir, while I may not
agree with what you say

10:42.351 --> 10:45.187
I'll defend to the death
your right to say it.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.397
There we are-- its
a Van Gogh print.

10:47.481 --> 10:48.857
Isn't it beautiful?

10:48.941 --> 10:49.942
Oh, yes, I've
often fantasized

10:50.025 --> 10:51.401
about what this
house would be like

10:51.485 --> 10:52.653
with more culture.

10:52.736 --> 10:53.737
The port is quite good.
Yes, quite good.

10:53.820 --> 10:54.821
Most certainly.
Indeed.

10:54.947 --> 10:56.031
What year is it?
'51.

10:56.114 --> 10:57.199
Ah.
Delectable.

10:57.282 --> 10:58.283
Indeed.
Yes.

10:58.367 --> 10:59.368
Oh, dear.
What is it?

10:59.493 --> 11:01.036
-I've spontaneously combusted.
-Oh, it's quite all right.

11:01.119 --> 11:02.746
It's quite all right.
I've grown tired of living.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.122
Very good, then.
Indeed. For the best.

11:04.206 --> 11:05.582
Is it raining again?

11:07.501 --> 11:09.461
Hey, did you hear
the one about us?

11:11.213 --> 11:13.090
Wow, you're such
a good dancer.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.842
Way to go
on that beer bong.

11:14.925 --> 11:16.176
Yeah, no fake.
No fake.

11:16.260 --> 11:17.553
Mom!

11:17.636 --> 11:19.471
Hey, what are you
doing here?

11:19.555 --> 11:21.223
What am I doing here?

11:21.306 --> 11:23.934
I've been waiting
out here for hours.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.310
What?

11:25.394 --> 11:27.354
You were supposed to
pop inside real quick

11:27.437 --> 11:29.565
and find someone who
looked enough like me

11:29.648 --> 11:30.983
so I could
use their ID.

11:31.066 --> 11:32.901
And then you were
supposed to come out

11:32.985 --> 11:35.028
and give the I.D. so
I could get inside.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.740
( chuckling ):
What?

11:38.824 --> 11:40.450
God, it's like talking
to a three year old.

11:40.534 --> 11:42.119
Oh, you know what?

11:42.202 --> 11:44.288
You need to learn how
to loosen up a little, toots.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.415
Yeah, I get the feeling you're
loose enough for the both of us.

11:46.498 --> 11:47.583
What?
Nothing.

11:47.666 --> 11:49.042
That's right, nothing.

11:49.126 --> 11:50.544
Don't you sass me.

11:51.670 --> 11:52.921
( phone rings )

11:53.005 --> 11:55.174
Good evening.
Stevenson residence.

11:55.257 --> 11:56.884
Chris, honey,
we've been over this

11:56.967 --> 11:58.093
a thousand times.

11:58.177 --> 11:59.469
It's pronounced
Griffin.

11:59.553 --> 12:00.804
Hi, Mom.

12:00.888 --> 12:01.930
Hi, Chris.

12:02.014 --> 12:03.307
Put your father on.

12:03.390 --> 12:04.474
Hey, Dad.

12:04.558 --> 12:06.143
And the French
guy says

12:06.226 --> 12:08.061
"Deodorant?
What's that?"

12:08.145 --> 12:09.855
( all laugh )

12:09.938 --> 12:11.315
All right, all right.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.733
I've-I've got one.

12:12.816 --> 12:14.318
I've got one.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.904
Um, okay, two men are standing
at the pearly gates...

12:16.987 --> 12:18.989
Oh, God, wait,
how did that one go?

12:19.072 --> 12:21.742
Well, anyway, it turns out
they're Siegfried and Roy.

12:21.825 --> 12:23.243
I'm no good at telling jokes.

12:23.327 --> 12:24.870
Dad, it's Mom.

12:24.953 --> 12:27.039
Oh, God, please be Somerset Maugham.
Please be Somerset Maugham.

12:27.122 --> 12:28.290
Hello?

12:28.373 --> 12:29.708
Peter?
Damn.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.585
I was just calling to
check in with my boys.

12:31.668 --> 12:32.794
See how you
guys are doing.

12:32.878 --> 12:33.921
Oh, uh, we're fine.

12:34.004 --> 12:35.005
( laughter in background )

12:35.088 --> 12:36.089
What's all
that noise?

12:36.173 --> 12:37.966
Uh, nothing. Nothing.

12:38.050 --> 12:39.968
LOIS ( on tape ): Peter I need you
to take out the trash.

12:40.052 --> 12:41.053
Okay, Lois.

12:41.136 --> 12:42.221
Lois, I got to go.

12:42.304 --> 12:44.097
Holy crap, Brian,
what am I going to do?

12:44.181 --> 12:46.350
Lois is going to be home
in a couple of days

12:46.433 --> 12:48.852
and we're getting kicked out
of the house tomorrow.

12:48.936 --> 12:49.937
What do you suggest?

12:50.020 --> 12:51.021
Get out your ring.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.147
Peter, that's
not going to..

12:52.231 --> 12:53.357
Come on!

12:53.440 --> 12:55.150
BOTH:
Wondertwin powers, activate!

12:55.234 --> 12:58.445
Form of... steam!

12:58.529 --> 13:01.573
Peter, we got these in
a box of Frankenberry.

13:01.657 --> 13:03.325
A jackal! Jackal!
It's a jackal!

13:03.408 --> 13:05.244
It looks like a jackal!
Jackal! Jackal!

13:05.327 --> 13:06.328
It's a Jackal! Jackal!

13:06.411 --> 13:07.955
Time!

13:08.038 --> 13:09.331
It wasn't right the first time
you said it

13:09.414 --> 13:11.667
why the hell would it be right
the next ten times?!

13:12.835 --> 13:13.836
God!

13:17.673 --> 13:18.715
Oh, man,
I am screwed.

13:18.799 --> 13:20.092
I'm going to
lose my house

13:20.175 --> 13:21.885
and my boat
and everything.

13:21.969 --> 13:24.304
How am I going to come up
with 50 grand by tomorrow?

13:24.388 --> 13:27.182
You could whore yourself out
to a thousand fat chicks

13:27.266 --> 13:28.600
for 50 bucks apiece.

13:28.684 --> 13:31.603
Or 50 really fat chicks
for a thousand bucks.

13:31.687 --> 13:33.772
What? Don't look at me
like that.

13:33.856 --> 13:35.607
Fat chicks need love, too...

13:35.691 --> 13:37.025
but they got to pay.

13:37.109 --> 13:38.527
Ah, what is this?

13:38.610 --> 13:41.655
Sea water. Courtesy
of that gentleman over there.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.031
( laughing )

13:43.115 --> 13:44.449
You need 50 grand, Griffin?

13:44.533 --> 13:46.201
Well, I got a suggestion
for you.

13:46.285 --> 13:47.911
Why don't you kill Daggermouth?

13:50.247 --> 13:51.748
Maybe I will,
Hennessey.

13:51.832 --> 13:54.877
OLD MAN: You'd be buying yourself
a one-way ticket

13:54.960 --> 13:56.503
to a watery grave.

13:56.587 --> 13:59.673
Daggermouth is the meanest,
most ruthless creature

13:59.756 --> 14:01.884
that's ever inhabited the sea.

14:01.967 --> 14:04.970
Legend has it he dwells
out by Fish Stench Cove.

14:05.053 --> 14:07.347
He'll kill any man
that comes near there.

14:07.431 --> 14:08.640
I saw him once.

14:08.724 --> 14:10.350
Sure, I'm blind in one eye

14:10.434 --> 14:13.478
and my other eye was infected
that day from picking at it

14:13.562 --> 14:15.189
and I was tired

14:15.272 --> 14:17.649
and I'd been swimming in a pool
with too much chlorine

14:17.733 --> 14:20.110
and that was the hour my glasses
were at Lenscrafters

14:20.194 --> 14:21.195
but I seen that fish!

14:21.278 --> 14:22.779
Well, if there's
50 grand in it

14:22.863 --> 14:24.406
I don't think
I got a choice.

14:24.489 --> 14:25.866
Well, you could
whore yourself out

14:25.949 --> 14:27.826
to a thousand fat
chicks for 50 bucks.

14:27.910 --> 14:28.911
No, we covered that.

14:28.994 --> 14:30.662
You ain't got
a chance, Griffin.

14:30.746 --> 14:32.789
Daggermouth killed
my friend Salty

14:32.873 --> 14:35.042
and he was twice
the fisherman you are.

14:35.125 --> 14:36.418
And half the weight.

14:36.502 --> 14:37.503
( sizzles )

14:37.586 --> 14:40.380
Hey, no. No. Hot.

14:40.464 --> 14:41.632
He's right, Peter.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.550
It'd be suicide
to go after that fish.

14:43.634 --> 14:44.635
There's got to be
another way.

14:44.718 --> 14:45.969
We could have
a bake sale.

14:46.053 --> 14:48.388
Oh, now see,
I think that's a neat idea.

14:48.472 --> 14:51.391
No, I am not going to let
my family live on the street.

14:51.475 --> 14:52.684
Not even if it means

14:52.768 --> 14:54.311
ending up like Seamus here.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.687
Now, if you'll excuse me

14:55.771 --> 14:57.773
I have a date with destiny.

14:57.856 --> 15:00.400
So, were you, like,
in an accident or what?

15:00.484 --> 15:02.528
No. Me father
was a tree.

15:06.615 --> 15:08.242
What's wrong with me?

15:08.325 --> 15:11.078
I got to be crazy to think
I can kill that man-eating fish.

15:11.161 --> 15:12.913
I mean, what the hell
am I doing?

15:12.996 --> 15:13.997
Hey, hey, hey.

15:14.081 --> 15:15.082
Come on, Peter.

15:15.165 --> 15:16.917
What kind of
talk is that?

15:17.000 --> 15:18.502
Yeah, you can do it.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.379
Who's my big,
brave boy, huh?

15:20.462 --> 15:21.588
Me.

15:21.672 --> 15:23.090
Who's my big,
brave boy?

15:23.173 --> 15:24.466
Me.

15:24.550 --> 15:26.760
( blows raspberry )

15:26.844 --> 15:28.053
( laughs )

15:30.264 --> 15:33.016
-This sucks, Mom.
-Meg, stop moping.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.768
These are the best
years of your life.

15:34.852 --> 15:37.271
Now, let's get up there
and live a little, huh?

15:39.731 --> 15:41.400
Mom! I look
like an idiot.

15:41.483 --> 15:43.026
No, you don't.

15:43.110 --> 15:46.280
Come on. Just move your
hips a little, like this.

15:46.363 --> 15:48.907
( chanting ):
Lois, Lois, Lois, Lois...

15:48.991 --> 15:51.827
( chanting ):
Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg...

15:51.910 --> 15:55.497
-( all chanting : Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg,
-Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg...

15:55.581 --> 15:57.666
Attagirl. Shake your moneymaker!

16:04.423 --> 16:05.924
Oh, my God!
It's a chick!

16:06.008 --> 16:07.050
Ay, Dios mio!

16:07.134 --> 16:08.385
Una chica!

16:08.468 --> 16:10.554
All right, everybody.
This party's over.

16:10.637 --> 16:11.680
Hey, why do you cops

16:11.763 --> 16:13.265
always have to kill our buzz?

16:13.348 --> 16:15.184
He used a teenage
colloquialism.

16:15.267 --> 16:16.393
Get the tear gas.

16:19.688 --> 16:20.856
Not so fast, big guy.

16:20.939 --> 16:22.858
What are you guys
doing here?

16:22.941 --> 16:25.027
We're going to help you
kill the fish.

16:25.110 --> 16:26.403
But this is going
to be dangerous.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.863
We could all die.

16:27.946 --> 16:29.656
Oh, come on.
You're our best friend, Peter.

16:29.740 --> 16:30.908
Besides,
I can remember a time

16:30.991 --> 16:32.576
when you saved
all our butts.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.328
( muffled ):
Uh-uh! Uh-uh!

16:34.411 --> 16:37.289
Hyah!

16:37.372 --> 16:39.666
Yeah, too bad
I didn't get there till after the sodomy.

16:39.750 --> 16:42.044
All right, let's go kick
some fish ass, eh?!

16:42.127 --> 16:44.087
( all cheering )

16:46.757 --> 16:49.801
I can't believe I
just showed everyone my tater tots.

16:49.885 --> 16:52.137
Worst of all, now
I'm going to have a police record!

16:52.221 --> 16:54.723
Now, Meg, if you're going
to grab ahold of life

16:54.806 --> 16:56.767
you've got to expect
to get your hands dirty

16:56.850 --> 16:58.018
once in a while.

16:58.101 --> 17:00.020
It was kind of cool
that people noticed me.

17:00.103 --> 17:01.563
That's the spirit,
honey.

17:01.647 --> 17:03.899
Okay. One, two, three,
tuck and roll!

17:09.029 --> 17:10.614
Ah. We're right
on course, guys.

17:10.697 --> 17:11.990
Give me another beer.

17:12.074 --> 17:14.576
Ah. You know,
these are the precious moments--

17:14.660 --> 17:16.203
the four of us
out at sea

17:16.286 --> 17:18.997
miles away
from civilization tossing back brews.

17:19.081 --> 17:20.999
Amen.
Got that right.

17:21.083 --> 17:22.751
Hey, hey, you guys.
Here's one for you.

17:22.835 --> 17:24.044
Let's say none of us
were married.

17:24.127 --> 17:25.921
If you could have
any woman in the world

17:26.004 --> 17:27.130
who would it be?

17:27.214 --> 17:28.674
Mariel Hemingway.

17:28.757 --> 17:30.259
-Ah, come on! That's not
-a very good choice.

17:30.342 --> 17:31.468
She's so jagged.

17:31.552 --> 17:33.262
No, no. I think
she's very attractive

17:33.345 --> 17:35.097
in a classical
kind of way.

17:35.180 --> 17:36.765
Yeah, but you could cut
a roast on her face.

17:36.849 --> 17:38.517
I would go
with Margaret Thatcher.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.269
Margaret Thatcher?
Margaret Thatcher?

17:40.352 --> 17:41.854
Why the hell
Margaret Thatcher?

17:41.937 --> 17:44.565
Oh, so nobody here thinks
power is sexy?

17:44.648 --> 17:47.317
Not one of you finds power sexy?

17:47.401 --> 17:48.443
How about you, Peter?

17:48.527 --> 17:49.570
Like you gotta ask.

17:49.653 --> 17:50.654
The chick with
the three knockers

17:50.737 --> 17:51.738
from Total Recall.

17:51.822 --> 17:53.282
-Interesting. I never saw
-that movie.

17:53.365 --> 17:55.742
Hey, you know, one of them
was papier maché, right?

17:55.826 --> 17:57.160
Oh, gee! Can
I change my ans...

17:57.244 --> 17:59.454
of course I know
it's paper... I don't care!

17:59.538 --> 18:00.622
What's wrong with you.

18:00.706 --> 18:01.957
So what about you, Quagmire?

18:02.040 --> 18:03.041
Taylor Hanson.

18:04.334 --> 18:05.627
Taylor Hanson's a guy.

18:05.711 --> 18:06.712
( laughs )

18:06.795 --> 18:09.339
Oh, you guys
are yanking me!

18:09.423 --> 18:13.510
Ha! Hey, let's put one
over on old Quagmire!

18:13.594 --> 18:14.803
( laughs )

18:14.887 --> 18:17.181
No, he's actually
a guy, Quagmire.

18:17.264 --> 18:18.473
Wha...?

18:18.557 --> 18:19.892
Well, this is insane!

18:19.975 --> 18:21.101
That's impossible!

18:22.227 --> 18:23.604
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

18:23.687 --> 18:24.855
Oh, my God!

18:24.938 --> 18:26.315
I can... oh, God, I...

18:26.398 --> 18:28.567
Oh, I got all
these magazines...

18:28.650 --> 18:29.985
Oh, Go.. oh, God!

18:30.068 --> 18:31.320
Oh, God!

18:35.490 --> 18:37.993
This must be
Fish Stench Cove.

18:38.076 --> 18:40.621
Right now, all we got
to do is find the fish.

18:40.704 --> 18:43.749
( English accent ):
I wonder where that fish did go.

18:43.832 --> 18:47.252
A fish, a fish, a fishy, oh.

18:53.675 --> 18:57.721
( water dripping )

18:57.804 --> 19:00.432
I heard that when
Daggermouth eats you

19:00.516 --> 19:02.726
he devours your guts first.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.937
I heard he doesn't
just eat you

19:05.020 --> 19:06.480
he eats your soul.

19:06.563 --> 19:09.233
I heard that one of
Shannon Doherty's eyes

19:09.316 --> 19:11.985
is off-center 'cause
it's trying to escape.

19:12.069 --> 19:14.071
MALE VOICE:
Welcome, gentlemen.

19:14.154 --> 19:15.197
( all gasp )

19:15.280 --> 19:16.406
It's him! Quick, shoot him!

19:17.699 --> 19:18.784
Not so fast.

19:18.867 --> 19:21.245
Perhaps I could offer
you a glass of port

19:21.328 --> 19:23.205
and you a glass
of starboard.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.624
( chuckles )
That's a little nautical joke.

19:25.707 --> 19:26.708
I'm a fish, you see.

19:26.792 --> 19:28.377
I'm also delightfully mad.

19:28.460 --> 19:31.588
Oh, dear. Would you
mind holding still for a moment?

19:31.672 --> 19:34.174
These antique pistols take
about ten minutes to reload.

19:34.258 --> 19:35.634
Peter, catch!

19:35.717 --> 19:37.427
Ow! Don't throw stuff
at me, Joe.

19:37.511 --> 19:38.679
Peter, shoot him!

19:38.762 --> 19:40.013
Oh, yeah. Right.

19:42.266 --> 19:44.518
( electrical crackling )

19:45.310 --> 19:46.770
My God.

19:46.854 --> 19:49.731
Isn't it amazing that
that's what we all look like

19:49.815 --> 19:50.899
on the inside?

19:51.024 --> 19:52.693
It's a robot,
you idiot.

19:52.776 --> 19:54.778
-Who are you?
-I'm Salty.

19:54.862 --> 19:56.196
Salty?
But everybody said

19:56.280 --> 19:58.115
you were killed
by that fish.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.741
That's what I wanted
them to think.

19:59.825 --> 20:01.118
I disappeared
and spread

20:01.201 --> 20:02.619
the Daggermouth
rumor myself.

20:02.703 --> 20:03.954
Why?

20:04.037 --> 20:05.205
Merchandise.

20:05.289 --> 20:07.666
Daggermouth T-shirts,
mugs, posters

20:07.749 --> 20:10.085
and I'm in talks
with Nickelodeon for a cartoon show.

20:10.169 --> 20:11.962
Figured I'd pair him
with an effeminate cat.

20:12.045 --> 20:13.088
What do you think?

20:13.172 --> 20:14.590
-Yeah, I'd watch that.
-Sure, sure.

20:14.673 --> 20:16.717
-Yeah, me, too. Sounds like
-a good balance.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.761
And now I'm going
to give you $50,000 to be on your way.

20:19.845 --> 20:20.846
$50,000? But why?

20:20.929 --> 20:22.431
To keep your mouth shut

20:22.514 --> 20:24.600
and because the longer
we stay here

20:24.683 --> 20:26.935
the more people are
going to question

20:27.019 --> 20:29.771
how a fisherman with no
engineering background

20:29.855 --> 20:32.816
managed to build
a sophisticated talking fish robot.

20:34.985 --> 20:37.654
You know, honey, I'm really
sorry for how I acted...

20:37.738 --> 20:38.864
getting so drunk

20:38.947 --> 20:40.324
and ditching you at the bar

20:40.407 --> 20:42.534
and letting those boys
take pictures of you

20:42.618 --> 20:43.994
while you were sleeping.

20:44.077 --> 20:45.704
I was so busy having fun

20:45.787 --> 20:47.915
I guess I kind of
ruined it for you.

20:47.998 --> 20:49.041
( horn honks )

20:49.124 --> 20:50.667
Uh-oh. We got company.

20:52.377 --> 20:54.296
( horn honks )

20:54.379 --> 20:56.632
Looks like your fans
are back, Mom.

20:56.715 --> 20:58.842
( chanting ):
Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg...

20:58.926 --> 21:01.345
No, I think this
one's all yours.

21:01.428 --> 21:02.930
Whoo!
You go, girl.

21:03.013 --> 21:05.641
MAN:
See? One's an innie and one's an outie.

21:07.559 --> 21:09.728
ANNOUNCER:
And now, back to Daggermouth

21:09.811 --> 21:11.688
and Boom Boom on Nickelodeon.

21:11.772 --> 21:15.108
Boom Boom, did you do
your exercises today?

21:15.192 --> 21:16.818
Yes. I did 20 laps

21:16.902 --> 21:18.654
and I'm about
to do 20 more.

21:18.737 --> 21:19.738
Oh, you...!

21:19.821 --> 21:20.822
Yikes!

21:24.785 --> 21:26.370
Oh, Peter, I'm so glad
being a fisherman

21:26.495 --> 21:27.538
is working out for you.

21:27.621 --> 21:28.747
You know, I got to admit

21:28.830 --> 21:30.165
I half expected
to come home

21:30.249 --> 21:31.792
and all our stuff
would be gone

21:31.875 --> 21:33.919
and we'd owe somebody
a whole lot of money.

21:34.002 --> 21:35.754
How can you half
expect something?

21:35.838 --> 21:36.964
I-I don't know.

21:37.047 --> 21:38.590
It's just a turn of phrase.

21:38.674 --> 21:40.008
How do you turn
a phrase?

21:40.092 --> 21:41.093
God, you're dumb.

21:41.176 --> 21:42.719
Thank God for that ass.

21:42.803 --> 21:44.680
Now, come here
and kiss me.

21:44.763 --> 21:46.348
Good night, honey.

21:46.431 --> 21:47.474
Good night, Lois.

21:47.558 --> 21:48.684
Good night Jim
and Abbie.

21:48.767 --> 21:49.768
Good night.
Good night.

21:49.852 --> 21:51.311
( blowing raspberry )

21:51.395 --> 21:52.479
( Peter chuckles )

21:52.563 --> 21:53.856
PETER:
Not now, Abbie.
