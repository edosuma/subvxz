BALTAR: Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.

00:25.526 --> 00:29.904
I, Sharon Agathon, will carry out
the lawful orders of my superiors

00:29.988 --> 00:32.699
as an officer in
the Colonial Fleet.

00:32.783 --> 00:34.325
Congratulations,
Lieutenant.

00:34.410 --> 00:36.661
I'm talking about people
blowing themselves up.

00:36.745 --> 00:41.541
I've got one job here, lady, and
one job only, to disrupt the Cylons,

00:41.625 --> 00:44.836
make them worry about this anthill
they've stirred up down here,

00:44.920 --> 00:49.090
so they're distracted and out of position
when the old man shows up in orbit.

00:49.299 --> 00:50.550
You know the mission.

00:50.634 --> 00:53.886
You should also know there's
only one way this mission ends,

00:53.971 --> 00:58.975
and that's with the successful rescue
of our people off of New Caprica.

00:59.059 --> 01:03.396
Evacuate the entire facility. You should go
as well, Gaius. There's a place for you, too.

01:04.314 --> 01:06.899
Captain? Hi.
Who's this?

01:06.984 --> 01:08.109
This is...

01:08.193 --> 01:09.318
Kacey.

01:12.239 --> 01:13.781
Oh, my little girl!

01:13.866 --> 01:16.868
When the Cylons
took her, I thought...

01:16.952 --> 01:18.578
But you saved her.

01:18.662 --> 01:19.662
(SNIFFS)

01:20.497 --> 01:21.998
Gods bless you.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.208
Hey.

01:24.293 --> 01:26.919
A lot of good people had to
pay the price for what they did,

01:27.004 --> 01:30.590
the choices they made on
New Caprica, like my wife.

01:31.175 --> 01:33.551
That's right.
Ellen collaborated.

01:34.344 --> 01:37.889
She gave the Cylons information on
the resistance and she died for it.

01:40.184 --> 01:42.268
I can't believe there's still
a question of my value.

01:42.352 --> 01:44.145
There will always
be a question.

01:44.229 --> 01:45.855
You're human.

01:58.827 --> 02:00.745
BALTAR: Good to see you.

02:00.829 --> 02:05.541
I far prefer these picturesque settings
for our little interludes, don't you?

02:06.376 --> 02:09.712
I thought you'd abandoned
me to your Cylon comrades.

02:11.089 --> 02:12.715
NO. 6: Would I do that?

02:14.301 --> 02:16.803
BALTAR: You've always
been more unpredictable

02:16.887 --> 02:18.679
than your flesh-and-blood
counterparts.

02:18.764 --> 02:20.640
NO. 6: A man that loves
women as much as you

02:20.724 --> 02:23.059
should have learned
that a long time ago.

02:27.523 --> 02:29.315
I'm a slow learner.

02:29.399 --> 02:31.317
Then take this period
as a time to learn

02:31.401 --> 02:33.653
all you can
about the Cylons.

02:33.737 --> 02:35.029
You'll need it
in the days ahead.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.989
Something special
on the horizon?

02:37.616 --> 02:40.243
Cylon psychology is
based on projection.

02:40.327 --> 02:41.369
Projection?

02:41.453 --> 02:44.080
It's how they choose to
see the world around them.

02:44.164 --> 02:47.667
The only difference
is you choose to see me.

02:49.711 --> 02:51.045
What are you?

02:52.005 --> 02:53.256
Really?

02:56.260 --> 02:59.512
You're either connected to
the woman I knew on Caprica,

03:00.931 --> 03:02.807
or you're a damaged part
of my subconscious

03:02.891 --> 03:06.435
struggling for self-expression,
so which one is it?

03:06.520 --> 03:09.313
I'm an angel of God
sent here to help you,

03:11.942 --> 03:14.026
just as I always
have been.

04:07.331 --> 04:09.957
We're all part of
one big ecosystem.

04:14.046 --> 04:16.964
Yes, I can feel it.
Breathing.

04:17.049 --> 04:18.633
Get used to it.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.262
So, what'd he say?

04:23.347 --> 04:25.723
I haven't asked him yet.

04:25.807 --> 04:27.350
Ask me about what?

04:28.936 --> 04:30.144
Earth.

04:32.439 --> 04:33.606
Well...

04:33.690 --> 04:35.858
Earth,
it's the Thirteenth Colony.

04:38.362 --> 04:41.113
Do you know how to find it?

04:41.198 --> 04:43.324
Not really, no.

04:43.408 --> 04:45.451
D'ANNA:
Well, that's unfortunate.

04:47.454 --> 04:50.665
There was a hope, my hope, that
if you knew the way to Earth,

04:50.749 --> 04:53.292
it would justify keeping
you alive a little longer.

04:53.377 --> 04:55.294
Come on, Six.

04:55.379 --> 04:58.297
Wait. Wait,
wait, wait.

04:58.382 --> 05:01.759
Now, when I say that I do not
know exactly where Earth is,

05:01.843 --> 05:05.972
that is not to say that I do not know a
very great deal about its probable location.

05:06.056 --> 05:10.309
Honestly, I spent hours, days,
weeks, months and months on a map

05:10.394 --> 05:12.478
that Adama and Roslin
found on Kobol.

05:12.562 --> 05:15.731
And I correlated that with
our astrometric observations.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.150
I doubt anyone here
can make the same claim.

05:18.235 --> 05:20.111
We'll get back to you.

05:23.115 --> 05:25.074
What do you care
about finding Earth?

05:26.743 --> 05:28.953
Because we're
looking for it.

05:29.705 --> 05:30.955
You are?

05:33.875 --> 05:37.503
Yes. We've decided that Earth
is going to be our new home.

A compressor blew. It
looks like it threw a blade.

08:05.402 --> 08:09.071
It severed the fuel line. Cally,
check the tank! Gods this is ugly.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.825

not even fumes in here.

how'd you land this thing?

08:15.245 --> 08:17.329
Pointed it toward the deck
and stopped when I got here.

08:17.414 --> 08:21.250
"Bone-dry," she says. Landed
the bird without a drop of fuel.

08:24.629 --> 08:28.382
If you want to die, I will
open up an airlock for you.

08:28.466 --> 08:30.509
But you are not taking
one of my Vipers with you.

08:30.594 --> 08:33.429

I'm on the deck.

08:33.513 --> 08:34.597
I don't know what
you're bitching about.

I don't give a frak

well, everyone's calling
it "Camp Oil Slick. "

Part of the hangar deck and they've
put up cots for, you know, refugees.

10:17.492 --> 10:18.993
Yeah. Yeah, I heard.

10:19.077 --> 10:22.162
Well, Kacey's been asking
to see you for days.

10:22.247 --> 10:26.583
And I sent messages and I thought
maybe, you know, you'd come to visit.

10:29.337 --> 10:30.713
You seem like
a really nice person,

10:30.797 --> 10:32.506
so I'm gonna be
honest with you.

10:32.590 --> 10:35.342
The last thing I need
is a two-year-old friend.

10:35.427 --> 10:37.136
And Kacey sure as hell
does not need me in her life,

10:37.220 --> 10:40.556
so do us both a favor and do not
bring her around here again, okay?

10:43.768 --> 10:45.436
Go to your mom, Kace.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.147
Sure.

10:48.231 --> 10:50.232
Sorry. Don't let us
keep you up.

10:51.401 --> 10:53.235
Sorry, honey,
we've got to go.

11:04.247 --> 11:05.998
There it goes.

11:06.624 --> 11:07.833
That's that.

11:07.917 --> 11:09.668
See?

11:09.753 --> 11:12.212
See? I told you,
you could do it.

11:13.381 --> 11:14.757
You did great.

11:15.759 --> 11:19.136
Remind me never to
let that happen again.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.430
You got it, "Slim. "

11:21.514 --> 11:22.639
Ever.

11:22.724 --> 11:23.932
(PANTING)

11:24.476 --> 11:27.311
I've been trying to
reassemble President...

11:27.395 --> 11:30.481
Doctor Baltar's work
on piecing together

11:30.565 --> 11:32.775
the Thirteenth Tribe's
path to Earth.

11:33.068 --> 11:35.194
I'm curious. Mr. Gaeta,
what is it that you trust

11:35.278 --> 11:36.904
about Doctor Baltar's
research?

11:36.988 --> 11:38.989
How do you know it's not
another one of his lies?

11:39.074 --> 11:41.325
If there was one thing
I learned about Baltar,

11:41.409 --> 11:45.788
it was his extraordinary
capacity for self-preservation.

11:45.872 --> 11:49.875
I think he wanted to find Earth
because he wanted to get there.

11:49.959 --> 11:52.503
How far did he get
with his research?

11:52.587 --> 11:55.297
Well, as you can see, I'm
still hacking through his notes,

11:55.382 --> 11:57.508
but it appears
that he was trying

11:57.592 --> 12:00.969
to correlate our own
astrometric readings

12:01.054 --> 12:04.890
with the map of constellations
we found back on Kobol.

12:04.974 --> 12:11.480
Now apply his findings to certain select
passages within the scroll of Pythia.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.023
Why the scroll of Pythia?

12:13.108 --> 12:15.859
Pythia is supposed to have
chronicled the original journey

12:15.944 --> 12:17.861
of the Thirteenth Tribe
on its way to Earth.

12:17.946 --> 12:19.530
If I can draw your
attention to this passage,

12:19.614 --> 12:24.701
"And the caravan of the heavens
was watched over by a great lion,

12:24.786 --> 12:26.662
"with a mighty
blinking eye... "

12:26.746 --> 12:28.497
"Red and blue. "

12:28.581 --> 12:29.623
GAETA: Exactly.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.041
Exactly what?

12:31.418 --> 12:32.751
We're looking
for a lion's head?

12:32.836 --> 12:34.420
With a mighty
blinking eye.

12:34.838 --> 12:35.879
Blinking.

12:35.964 --> 12:38.257
Well, these scrolls,
they speak in metaphors.

12:38.341 --> 12:40.968
Initially, I thought the doctor
might be off his meds as well, sir,

12:41.052 --> 12:45.889
but then I found
this note, here,

12:45.974 --> 12:48.434
where he had written,
"Blinking equals pulsar. "

12:48.518 --> 12:50.686
That means a star, right?

12:50.770 --> 12:54.606
Plural, actually. They're the
rotating cores of dead stars.

12:54.691 --> 12:56.692
They emit a blast
of radio waves.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.652
From a distance,
they appear to...

12:58.736 --> 13:00.529
Blink.
Right.

13:01.072 --> 13:05.659
GAETA: The doctor found two in very
close mutual orbit in this sector.

13:05.743 --> 13:10.372
The spectrographic readings that I
found show one will appear to be red

13:10.457 --> 13:12.332
and one will
appear to be blue.

13:12.417 --> 13:16.128
Now, these pulsars appear
to be in this nebula.

13:16.212 --> 13:18.172
We have never had
a direct look at this area,

13:18.256 --> 13:21.550
but it is possible with a
couple of eyeballs out there,

13:21.634 --> 13:24.136
they might look at
the nebula and see...

13:24.220 --> 13:25.762
A giant lion's head?

13:27.390 --> 13:30.267
Well, it looks like this is
the best thing we've got going,

13:30.351 --> 13:35.606
so, unless you object, Admiral,
I suggest we go lion hunting.

13:37.817 --> 13:41.028
CAPRICA SIX: Navigational markers
you gave us may prove useful.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.739
We've sent a Baseship out
to investigate the pulsars

13:43.823 --> 13:46.074
and look for this
"lion's head" of yours.

13:48.244 --> 13:50.287
Look, this isn't
easy for me.

13:50.371 --> 13:54.333
I don't think you fully appreciate
just how difficult this is!

13:54.417 --> 13:59.546
I have very conflicted, very ambiguous
feelings about helping you find Earth.

13:59.631 --> 14:00.672
(CAPRICA SIX CHUCKLES)

14:00.757 --> 14:03.675
Funny how all that ambivalence
and conflict seemed to vanish

14:03.760 --> 14:06.178
once you thought your
life hung in the balance.

14:08.890 --> 14:10.849
You should know there's
still a lot of skepticism

14:10.934 --> 14:13.268
about whether you're
being entirely truthful.

14:17.941 --> 14:18.941
Uh.

14:19.317 --> 14:20.692
Very sorry.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.028
We didn't mean
to intrude.

14:24.113 --> 14:25.781
Come on, Gaius.

14:32.956 --> 14:35.582
BALTAR: Are we going
around in circles?

14:35.667 --> 14:37.960
CAPRICA SIX: Sure it all looks
the same to you, doesn't it?

14:38.044 --> 14:42.506
It'd be hard for any human to navigate
around here, especially without projecting.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.383
Yes. You've used
that word before.

14:44.467 --> 14:46.176
I'm not quite sure
what you're talking about.

14:46.261 --> 14:48.470
It helps you to what,
exactly?

14:50.848 --> 14:52.391
Have you ever daydreamed?

14:52.475 --> 14:54.226
You know, imagined
that you were somewhere else?

14:54.310 --> 14:56.895
I do have an
active imagination.

14:56.980 --> 15:00.107
Well, we don't have
to imagine. We project.

15:00.191 --> 15:04.027
We choose to see our environment in
any form we wish, whenever we wish.

15:04.112 --> 15:06.613
For instance, right now, you
see us as standing in a hallway,

15:06.698 --> 15:08.699
but I see it as a forest.

15:13.162 --> 15:16.039
Filled with trees,
birds, sunlight.

15:16.124 --> 15:20.127
Like walks you and I
used to take on Caprica.

15:20.211 --> 15:22.796
The aesthetic is
what gives me pleasure,

15:22.880 --> 15:24.840
not the specific memories.

15:33.224 --> 15:34.600
Instead of staring
at blank walls,

15:34.684 --> 15:37.519
I choose to surround myself
with a vision of God's creation.

15:41.190 --> 15:43.692
BALTAR: Right. I think
I understand projection,

15:43.776 --> 15:46.194
but, it's a bit of
a coincidence, isn't it?

15:46.821 --> 15:51.533
That I could see such... a
vivid reality that I've created

15:51.618 --> 15:54.661
and the Cylon projection
experience seems to be so similar?

15:54.746 --> 15:56.788
Is it a coincidence?

15:56.873 --> 15:58.373
Well, what are you saying?

16:00.043 --> 16:01.460
There's a connection?

16:02.587 --> 16:04.796
What, because of
my experiences with you...

16:07.383 --> 16:08.634
Am I a Cylon?

16:09.677 --> 16:10.969
What was that?

16:14.265 --> 16:17.184
Oh, nothing. Just...
Just talking out loud.

16:18.353 --> 16:19.645
Silly me.

16:31.866 --> 16:34.034
ATHENA: So, are you sure you
want to go in second seat again?

16:34.118 --> 16:36.828
I mean, I hear you're
a pretty fair pilot now.

16:36.913 --> 16:38.997
Yeah, well, too many
pilots, not enough birds.

16:39.082 --> 16:41.833
Anything to keep me
flying at this point.

16:41.918 --> 16:43.752
You want me,
I'm yours, Boomer.

16:45.797 --> 16:48.882
No, Boomer was...
She was someone else.

16:51.761 --> 16:54.930
Listen up! We need a call
sign for Lieutenant Agathon!

16:55.014 --> 16:56.640
Chromedome!
MAN 2:Titania!

16:56.724 --> 16:58.642
WOMAN 1: Raptor Adaptor.
WOMAN 2: Windup Toy.

16:58.726 --> 17:00.811
Tin Can!
Vermin Chaser!

17:00.895 --> 17:02.145
MAN 3: Micro Chick.

17:02.230 --> 17:03.397
HOTDOG: How about "Athena"?

17:03.481 --> 17:04.523
MAN 4: "Digital Dame. "

17:04.607 --> 17:06.191
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait. What was that?

17:06.275 --> 17:08.694
You know, the goddess of wisdom and war,

17:08.778 --> 17:11.780
usually accompanied
by the goddess of victory.

17:14.283 --> 17:15.951
MAN 5: It works out.
MAN 6: She likes it.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.494
Athena it is.

17:19.163 --> 17:20.997
MAN 7: So be it.
MAN 8: Okay, deal.

17:21.082 --> 17:22.666
MAN 10: All right, you got
that. You want some more?

17:22.750 --> 17:27.796
KAT: Hey, Colonel! Colonel,
come have a seat. Over here.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.798
Enough of that
to go around?

17:30.925 --> 17:32.551
Always. Oh, yeah.

17:35.304 --> 17:39.266
"Deadman's Chest," cutthroat
game. Not usually your style.

17:39.350 --> 17:42.060
It is now.
And I'm in it to win.

17:42.145 --> 17:43.979
If you don't like it,
find another game.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.398
Now there's some
straight talk.

17:46.482 --> 17:49.609
You see the line
up outside the head?

17:49.694 --> 17:53.530
15 civilians standing in
line, picking their noses,

17:53.614 --> 17:55.532
waiting to take a shower.

17:55.616 --> 17:58.410
Frakking civilians think
they run the ship now.

17:58.494 --> 18:00.495
Beats who we had before.
Ship was like a tomb.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.330
You want to know
what "alone" feels like,

18:02.415 --> 18:05.375
try spending a few weeks
in a Cylon holding cell.

18:05.460 --> 18:08.086
Yeah. It was a bitch
on both sides.

18:08.171 --> 18:11.673
It wasn't exactly easy coming up
with a plan to save your sorry butts.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.759
Yeah, you guys
had it rough, huh?

18:13.843 --> 18:16.386
Hot showers,
three squares a day.

18:16.471 --> 18:19.014
Viper jocks didn't even take a
shot until you jumped into orbit.

18:19.098 --> 18:22.350
Hey. We all
made sacrifices.

18:22.435 --> 18:23.643
That so?

18:23.728 --> 18:24.936
Yes, that's right.

18:25.021 --> 18:28.523
While you were pinning wings
on your Cylon girlfriend,

18:28.608 --> 18:32.068
our people were strapping
homemade bombs to their chests,

18:32.153 --> 18:35.822
doing whatever they could
to take the bastards out.

18:35.907 --> 18:40.744
So forgive me if I don't get
all misty over your sacrifices.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.752
CAPRICA SIX: You seem
distracted, Gaius.

18:50.296 --> 18:51.546
I'm fine.

18:54.091 --> 18:57.302
You can rest easy,
at least for now.

18:57.386 --> 19:01.139
Data on Earth's location and
your valiant rescue of the baby

19:01.224 --> 19:03.725
has gone a long way toward
impressing the others.

19:08.898 --> 19:11.441
I used to think you and I
would have a baby one day.

19:13.236 --> 19:14.820
There are only
12 Cylon models.

19:14.904 --> 19:17.781
But in the entire occupation
on New Caprica I only saw seven.

19:17.865 --> 19:19.783
Now, here again,
the same seven.

19:21.619 --> 19:23.829
Who are the Final Five?

19:23.913 --> 19:25.121
I can't talk about that.

19:25.206 --> 19:26.873
Can't or won't?
I can't.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.585
It's complicated. But we
don't talk about them, ever.

19:33.589 --> 19:35.006
But you'd know one
of them, wouldn't you,

19:35.091 --> 19:36.466
if you saw them,
one of the Final Five

19:36.551 --> 19:38.343
if they were to
walk past here, right?

19:38.427 --> 19:40.178
Six, we have
a problem.

19:40.263 --> 19:44.683
A Baseship, the one we sent to
investigate the pulsars in the Lion nebula,

19:44.767 --> 19:46.560
we've lost contact.

19:48.437 --> 19:52.107
The trouble is, we know almost nothing
about the missing Baseship's status.

19:52.191 --> 19:55.694
We received a garbled
distress call, then silence.

19:55.778 --> 19:59.281
Not surprisingly, their Hybrid
sent us a confusing set of data.

19:59.365 --> 20:00.574
Our Hybrid is
analyzing it.

20:00.658 --> 20:02.117
What are these Hybrids
he's talking about?

20:02.201 --> 20:03.660
Be quiet, Gaius.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.012
NO. EIGHT: Our Hybrid's
deciphered part of the data set

20:22.096 --> 20:23.847
that we received
from our scout ship.

20:23.931 --> 20:25.932
DORAL: This can't happen
to us. It's impossible.

20:26.017 --> 20:27.392
SIMON: It is
not only possible,

20:27.476 --> 20:29.728
it may have been inevitable
once we took human form.

20:29.812 --> 20:32.480
DORAL: We're not human.
We're not like him.

20:32.565 --> 20:35.317
LEOBEN: God has chosen this
time, this place to test us.

20:35.401 --> 20:38.403
Whether we fail or pass
the test is up to us.

20:42.325 --> 20:44.326
What is going on?

20:44.410 --> 20:47.787
The missing Baseship, it's been
infected with some kind of disease.

20:47.872 --> 20:48.997
Disease?

20:49.081 --> 20:51.416
Yes. It's killing them.
All of them.

20:51.500 --> 20:55.503
If an infected Cylon dies and carries this
disease with them into a Resurrection ship,

20:55.588 --> 20:58.798
it could rapidly spread, potentially
infecting our entire race.

20:58.883 --> 21:01.259
All right. We make sure that the
Resurrection ship is out of range,

21:01.344 --> 21:02.928
then we jump to
their location,

21:03.012 --> 21:04.512
send in a group
of Centurions to...

21:04.597 --> 21:08.099
No. The data set indicates that as
soon as their Hybrid was infected,

21:08.184 --> 21:09.392
their Centurions
started shutting down.

21:09.477 --> 21:11.019
We don't know how ours
are gonna be affected.

21:11.103 --> 21:14.147
I assume our Raiders and
Baseships are also susceptible.

21:14.231 --> 21:17.943
Of course. We are all created
from the same genetic pool.

21:18.027 --> 21:21.738
Then no Cylon can board that
ship without risking infection.

21:26.077 --> 21:28.453
Say you'll go aboard
the infected Baseship

21:28.537 --> 21:30.288
and investigate
what happened.

21:30.373 --> 21:32.499
You sent them to
that nebula, remember?

21:32.583 --> 21:33.875
Are you mad?

21:35.795 --> 21:39.673
You have to prove to them you
can be counted on in an emergency.

21:39.757 --> 21:41.466
Show them you're
worth keeping alive.

21:41.550 --> 21:43.301
And what if I catch
the disease?

21:45.179 --> 21:48.807
What are the chances that a
human could catch something

21:48.891 --> 21:51.267
that infects
a Centurion or a Raider?

21:51.352 --> 21:54.854
That is, if you're human.
And if you're really a Cylon,

21:54.939 --> 21:58.817
one of the Final Five
you haven't seen yet,

21:58.901 --> 22:02.237
then wouldn't you just rather
get it over with and die?

22:04.365 --> 22:05.573
I'll go.

22:06.575 --> 22:07.742
What?

22:11.122 --> 22:12.622
Yes, I'll go.

22:14.250 --> 22:17.544
Look, I am a trained scientist.
I can go to the Baseship.

22:17.628 --> 22:20.630
I can make observations about the
Cylons, their physical condition,

22:20.715 --> 22:23.925
bring back information about this
disease which now threatens all of you.

22:24.010 --> 22:26.511
We've learned the disease
that's killing the human Cylons

22:26.595 --> 22:28.513
could infect one of
our Raiders as well.

22:28.597 --> 22:30.682
Then don't
send a Raider.

22:30.766 --> 22:34.769
Surely, the war's furbished
you with some Colonial vessels?

22:34.854 --> 22:38.773
He's right. We could program one of
our Raptors to approach on autopilot.

22:43.112 --> 22:44.779
All right, then,
prepare to jump the ship.

22:44.864 --> 22:48.366
Make sure the Resurrection ship
knows to stay behind, out of range.

22:49.618 --> 22:51.453
A truly selfless act.

23:03.591 --> 23:05.508
Hey, I could use
a refill here.

23:07.636 --> 23:09.429
Here's to knowing

23:10.890 --> 23:13.641
that somebody will
always have your back!

23:14.685 --> 23:17.145
The sentiment's good,
but in my book,

23:18.481 --> 23:21.066
trust is an
overrated commodity.

23:22.693 --> 23:24.486
That one I'll drink to.

23:25.654 --> 23:27.155
Frak you guys.

23:28.491 --> 23:29.908
What is your problem,
Katraine?

23:29.992 --> 23:31.785
My problem is you, Captain.

23:31.869 --> 23:34.204
All this
"us against them" crap.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.583
STARBUCK: Truth hurts, doesn't
it? Give me another one.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.502
You know what, Starbuck? Whatever
happened to you down there,

23:40.586 --> 23:41.920
why don't you take
it out on the Cylons?

23:42.004 --> 23:43.963
'Cause we busted our ass
to get you off that rock!

23:44.048 --> 23:47.425
Oh, do you think
that means anything?

23:47.510 --> 23:51.846
Every colonist that landed on
New Caprica was loyal to a point.

23:53.891 --> 23:56.184
It was amazing
watching those people

23:56.268 --> 23:59.104
that you thought you knew
go over to the Cylons.

23:59.188 --> 24:00.939
At least, in the end,
we knew where we stood, huh?

24:01.023 --> 24:02.857
Is that so?

24:02.942 --> 24:05.652
Then how come
you are off flight duty

24:05.736 --> 24:09.614
and some "Cylon-lover"
is holding down my post?

24:09.698 --> 24:12.659
Don't kid yourselves. You're
on your own in this life,

24:12.743 --> 24:14.285
each and every one of us.

24:14.370 --> 24:15.912
KAT: Why don't you tell
that to the pilots

24:15.996 --> 24:18.456
that died getting
you off that rock?

24:19.542 --> 24:23.670
And Gaeta's briefing Sharon and Racetrack
on the scouting mission to the Pulsars.

24:23.754 --> 24:26.005
You mean Athena
and Racetrack.

24:27.925 --> 24:29.300
Word travels fast.

24:29.385 --> 24:30.760
Yes, it does.

24:32.054 --> 24:35.723
I understand that morale's
taken a hit on the flight deck.

24:36.976 --> 24:38.560
Nothing we can't
handle, sir.

24:40.563 --> 24:42.313
I'm also told
that Colonel Tigh

24:42.398 --> 24:45.316
is spending a lot of time
down in the pilot's rec room.

24:47.111 --> 24:49.279
Both him and Starbuck, sir.

24:49.363 --> 24:52.115
They've been holding court,
second guessing the rescue,

24:52.199 --> 24:54.534
badmouthing the crew that
stayed up with Galactica.

24:54.618 --> 24:57.662
Suddenly, if you weren't in the ground
war, it's like you can't be trusted.

24:57.746 --> 24:59.956
And people are listening?

25:00.040 --> 25:02.292
Their word carries
a lot of weight.

25:02.376 --> 25:05.920
You're right, they're destroying
morale and unit cohesion.

25:06.005 --> 25:08.047
They both know better.

25:08.132 --> 25:10.091
I don't think
they care, sir.

25:18.851 --> 25:22.312
HYBRID: Two protons expelled at each
coupling site creates them under force.

25:22.396 --> 25:25.315
The embryo becomes a fish that
we don't enter until eight plate.

25:25.399 --> 25:28.443
We're here to experience,
evolve the little toe, atrophy.

25:28.527 --> 25:31.196
Don't ask me how, I'll be
dead in 1,000 light years.

25:31.280 --> 25:34.365
Thank you. Thank you.
Genesis turns to its source,

25:34.450 --> 25:37.493
reduction occurs stepwise
though the essence is all one.

25:37.578 --> 25:39.245
End of line.

25:39.330 --> 25:42.373
FTL system check, diagnostic
functions within parameters,

25:42.458 --> 25:44.542
repeats the harlequin,
the agony exquisite,

25:44.627 --> 25:46.628
the colors run
the path of ashes.

25:46.712 --> 25:49.714
Neuronal network run 52%
of heat exchanger.

25:49.798 --> 25:52.383
Cross-collateralized with
hyperdimensional matrix.

25:52.468 --> 25:55.762
Upper sensors repair ordered,
relay to zero, zero, zero, zero...

25:55.846 --> 25:57.263
BALTAR: Is it
aware of us?

25:57.348 --> 26:00.808
CAPRICA SIX: Of course. She's
aware of everything aboard.

26:00.893 --> 26:02.310
HYBRID: End of line.

26:03.229 --> 26:04.729
New paragraph.

26:04.813 --> 26:06.731
(HYBRID CONTINUES CHATTERING)

26:10.945 --> 26:14.280
Reduction occurs stepwise
though the essence is all one.

26:17.493 --> 26:20.161
Do you have any idea
what it's talking about?

26:20.246 --> 26:21.537
No.

26:21.622 --> 26:25.917
Most Cylons think the conscious mind
of the Hybrid has simply gone mad

26:26.001 --> 26:29.003
and the vocalizations
we hear are meaningless.

26:30.839 --> 26:33.049
But not everyone
thinks that?

26:34.635 --> 26:37.762
The ones you
know as "Leoben"

26:37.846 --> 26:41.724
believe that every word out
of her mouth means something.

26:41.809 --> 26:44.727
That God literally
speaks to us through her.

26:46.355 --> 26:48.898
She sort of controls
the Baseship, does she?

26:48.983 --> 26:52.860
Well, she is the Baseship,
in a very real sense.

26:52.945 --> 26:54.570
A mind gone mad.

26:55.739 --> 26:59.117
She experiences life very
differently than we do, Gaius.

26:59.201 --> 27:02.620
She swims in the heavens,

27:02.705 --> 27:05.707
laughs at stars,
breathes in cosmic dust.

27:05.791 --> 27:08.626
Maybe Leoben's right,

27:08.711 --> 27:10.628
maybe she does see God.

27:12.423 --> 27:14.215
We're wasting time.

27:17.511 --> 27:18.636
Jump.

28:35.631 --> 28:37.048
(DOOR OPENING)

28:46.809 --> 28:48.101
(WOMAN GASPING)

28:58.612 --> 29:00.738
There are bodies everywhere.

29:00.823 --> 29:02.323
Others dying.

29:44.408 --> 29:48.578
BALTAR: What the hell is that?
Definitely manmade.

30:08.932 --> 30:10.558
(WHEEZING)

30:20.819 --> 30:24.113
You're severely dehydrated.
You must drink some water.

30:24.198 --> 30:26.157
Kill me.

30:26.241 --> 30:28.910
You don't understand, there
is no Resurrection ship nearby.

30:28.994 --> 30:32.538
You will not be downloaded into
a new body, you will just be gone.

30:32.623 --> 30:34.415
I saw how they died.

30:35.751 --> 30:37.376
Please...

30:37.461 --> 30:39.837
Please, I can't bear that.

30:39.922 --> 30:42.840
I'm here to bring help.
All right?

30:42.925 --> 30:46.552
I'm just gonna take some blood
samples for analysis on the Baseship.

30:46.637 --> 30:50.431
And then we will be able to
make a treatment for the disease.

30:50.516 --> 30:51.766
(COUGHING)

30:55.646 --> 30:57.563
You must breathe, please.

30:57.648 --> 31:00.024
Please, take some water.

31:00.108 --> 31:02.485
You're...
You're from Galactica.

31:02.569 --> 31:04.904
No. I'm from a Baseship.

31:06.615 --> 31:07.949
Tell me,

31:10.619 --> 31:12.662
do you know
what this is?

31:15.541 --> 31:18.918
We found it floating
at these coordinates.

31:20.170 --> 31:22.171
It must be some kind of

31:23.257 --> 31:25.424
a beacon, a marker.

31:25.509 --> 31:28.052
It looks too old.
It looks very old.

31:29.263 --> 31:34.225
It must have been left by the
Thirteenth Tribe, infected, poisoned,

31:34.309 --> 31:37.061
left by some humans
like you to destroy us.

31:37.145 --> 31:38.521
What?

31:38.605 --> 31:42.733
A human device
filled with a pestilence.

31:42.818 --> 31:44.235
You sent us to this place.

31:44.319 --> 31:45.361
It wasn't me.

31:45.445 --> 31:47.405
You knew
we'd bring it aboard.

31:47.489 --> 31:48.906
You don't know
what you're saying.

31:48.991 --> 31:50.408
This is the disease...

31:50.492 --> 31:51.701
You knew we would...

31:51.785 --> 31:54.370
...speaking for you. Will you calm
down! I am going to bring help.

31:54.454 --> 31:55.746
I am going
to bring help.

31:55.831 --> 31:57.790
You wanted the other
Baseships to follow.

31:57.874 --> 31:59.417
I would never do
anything to hurt you.

31:59.501 --> 32:01.961
You wanted the other
Baseships. You knew it was here.

32:02.045 --> 32:03.588
I am going
to bring help.

32:03.672 --> 32:05.131
Be quiet.

32:05.215 --> 32:06.591
Suffer the same infection.

32:06.675 --> 32:07.758
Be quiet. I am going to bring help!

32:07.843 --> 32:08.843
You want to
destroy us all!

32:08.927 --> 32:11.429
It your fault!
You'll lie to them.

32:11.513 --> 32:13.014
Shut up!
No, you'll lie to them!

32:13.098 --> 32:14.473
Shut up!
You'll bring them here.

32:14.558 --> 32:16.267
It your fault!
Shut up!

32:16.351 --> 32:17.768
Be quiet!
No, let me...

32:17.853 --> 32:19.103
Shut up!

32:19.187 --> 32:22.898
Don't let me...
Shut up!

32:23.150 --> 32:24.358
(CHOKING)

32:32.659 --> 32:35.077
DORAL: Gaius, do you hear us?

32:35.162 --> 32:38.164
Gaius, do you read? Do you
read? Are any of them alive?

32:38.248 --> 32:39.957
Gaius Baltar,
what do you see?

32:40.042 --> 32:44.337
Speak to us. What do you see?
Are any of them alive?

32:44.421 --> 32:46.255
This is Gaius Baltar.

32:48.133 --> 32:49.717
I'm returning
to the Baseship.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.344
DORAL: What do you see?

32:53.221 --> 32:55.056
I see nothing.

32:56.391 --> 32:58.351
Nothing of consequence.

32:59.186 --> 33:01.228
There's nothing
left to do here.

33:11.573 --> 33:14.617
D'ANNA: Nobody likes it, but we
have to make a terrible choice.

33:14.701 --> 33:17.620
Do we attempt a rescue and
risk the lives of our fleet,

33:17.704 --> 33:19.872
even our species,
or do we leave them?

33:19.956 --> 33:22.500
The answer won't be found in science
because there is no cure in science.

33:22.584 --> 33:23.709
Well, there has to be.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.461
Look at them. They're so
afraid. Do we just leave them?

33:25.587 --> 33:26.837
Then their quest ended
in death. Absolutely, no.

33:26.922 --> 33:28.255
Even the humans don't
abandon their own.

33:28.340 --> 33:31.008
DORAL: They must be sacrificed
for the greater good.

33:31.093 --> 33:32.301
SIMON: There is
a greater question.

33:32.386 --> 33:34.762
Yes, there is.

33:34.846 --> 33:36.847
How did this happen?

33:36.932 --> 33:40.184
DORAL: Well, it's Baltar. It's his
fault, he led us there deliberately.

33:40.268 --> 33:43.020
He been working with
Galactica the whole time!

33:43.105 --> 33:44.647
It wasn't me.

33:44.731 --> 33:46.607
Whatever you think I did,
I didn't do it, honestly!

33:46.692 --> 33:49.068
Baltar, we followed
your coordinates,

33:49.152 --> 33:51.862
and found a disease
with no treatment or cure.

33:51.947 --> 33:54.782
If we leave, they're
doomed, never to return.

33:54.866 --> 33:57.576
Perhaps God would smile
upon us, for our mercy.

33:57.661 --> 34:00.788
Oh, listen to you. You can
barely even speak His name.

34:00.872 --> 34:03.374
D'ANNA: We have to agree. We
are not leaving our brothers.

34:03.458 --> 34:04.959
(ALL QUARRELLING)

34:10.465 --> 34:12.007
D'ANNA: Enough!

34:16.680 --> 34:18.347
We have to leave.

34:19.599 --> 34:23.144
We have to jump and leave them to
their fate. There is no other way.

34:23.687 --> 34:27.523
(SCREAMING)

34:35.282 --> 34:39.994
Mists of dreams drip along the
nascent echo and love no more.

34:41.163 --> 34:42.538
End of Line.

34:42.998 --> 34:44.707
The Hybrid objects.

34:44.791 --> 34:47.376
She doesn't get a vote.

34:47.461 --> 34:49.003
Jump the ship.

34:54.843 --> 34:56.010
Jump.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.692
D'ANNA: This disease,

35:12.694 --> 35:15.029
it must have
come from someplace.

35:18.533 --> 35:20.367
So what did you notice
on the infected ship?

35:20.452 --> 35:23.996
BALTAR: Nothing. Nothing. I
am just as baffled as you are.

35:24.915 --> 35:28.250
You noticed nothing suspicious
on the infected ship?

35:34.508 --> 35:36.217
Nothing whatsoever.

35:44.059 --> 35:45.851
CREWMAN: Admiral on deck!

35:45.936 --> 35:47.394
TIGH: Admiral.

35:51.691 --> 35:53.359
Give me the room.

35:54.736 --> 35:56.529
Stay in your seats.

36:03.078 --> 36:04.537
Have a drink?

36:08.250 --> 36:10.084
Give me your sidearm.

36:11.670 --> 36:12.753
What?

36:13.338 --> 36:14.839
Your sidearm.

36:31.898 --> 36:34.775
TIGH: Hey! There's
a live round in that!

36:34.860 --> 36:37.361
Now, one of you,
and I don't care who,

36:38.363 --> 36:40.781
pick that weapon
up and shoot me.

36:46.788 --> 36:47.872
Admiral, I don't know...

36:47.956 --> 36:49.456
I didn't say to talk.

36:49.916 --> 36:52.042
You've done enough
of that already.

36:52.794 --> 36:55.880
I said to pick up
that weapon and shoot.

37:00.427 --> 37:02.177
What's the matter?

37:02.262 --> 37:03.512
No guts?

37:04.806 --> 37:06.640
You don't got a pair?

37:07.475 --> 37:09.393
You're both
frakking cowards.

37:09.477 --> 37:11.437
Watch your mouth...
Or what?

37:11.521 --> 37:14.273
You gonna turn the rest of
my pilots against each other?

37:15.692 --> 37:17.318
Poison the crew?

37:19.154 --> 37:22.573
You've already done that,
Saul. Both of you.

37:22.657 --> 37:25.784
Yeah, but if you're looking for
an apology, it isn't gonna happen.

37:28.121 --> 37:29.955
You were like
a daughter to me once.

37:30.040 --> 37:31.332
No more.

37:33.335 --> 37:36.086
You're a malcontent
and a cancer,

37:38.173 --> 37:40.466
and I won't have
you on my ship.

37:41.217 --> 37:42.801
So you have a choice.

37:43.845 --> 37:47.181
You can figure out how to become
a human being again and an officer,

37:48.183 --> 37:51.769
or you can find another place
to live off of this ship.

37:51.853 --> 37:53.270
You're dismissed.

37:58.944 --> 38:01.487
Are you gonna kick me
out of my chair, too?

38:03.031 --> 38:04.490
Listen, I know
you've been through a lot...

38:04.574 --> 38:05.991
Don't patronize me.

38:06.076 --> 38:07.868
Say what you
came here to say.

38:10.997 --> 38:13.165
You're full of bile.
Hatred.

38:14.209 --> 38:18.087
And I know that it has something to
do with Ellen, and I'm sorry for that.

38:18.171 --> 38:21.799
And if you need time, Saul, well,
you take all the time you want.

38:21.883 --> 38:23.801
But I got to run a ship.

38:23.885 --> 38:28.430
The last thing I need is a
one-eyed drunk sitting down here,

38:29.307 --> 38:31.767
sowing discontent
and disobedience.

38:32.727 --> 38:34.895
So I'll tell you
once again, Saul.

38:36.356 --> 38:38.816
You can pick up that
weapon and kill me,

38:40.402 --> 38:43.320
or you can get your ass back
into your quarters and not leave

38:45.240 --> 38:49.076
until you're ready to act like the man
that I've known for the past 30 years.

39:07.262 --> 39:09.847
That man doesn't
exist anymore, Bill.

39:12.267 --> 39:14.435
And you won't be
seeing me again.

39:22.402 --> 39:23.819
MAN 1: Yeah, that's
why I work with him.

39:23.903 --> 39:25.279
MAN 2: Yeah, that's
what I'm talking about.

39:27.615 --> 39:29.700
MAN 3: Grab another
towel for me.

39:33.663 --> 39:35.039
Yeah, we got to
get up there.

39:35.123 --> 39:36.498
MAN 4: All right.

41:57.223 --> 41:59.433
Oh, my Gods,
it's right there.

42:00.435 --> 42:03.437
The Lion's Head nebula
and the Blinking Eye.

42:04.939 --> 42:07.357
Holy crap,
it's the road to Earth.

42:08.401 --> 42:09.776
(RACETRACK LAUGHING)

42:22.290 --> 42:25.542
Oh, my Gods! Let's get
the frak out of here.

42:25.627 --> 42:27.419
I'll start the jump.

42:31.883 --> 42:36.220
When Gods' anger awakens,
even the mighty shall fall.

42:36.304 --> 42:38.805
Frak! Athena, we need
to get out of here!
