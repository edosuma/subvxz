‐ So, uh, you're all here
to see a show.

15:09.075 --> 15:11.077
I'm seeing a show right now.

15:11.077 --> 15:13.412
And, um, yeah.
It'll be good.

15:13.412 --> 15:14.705
It'll be good.
It'll be good.

15:14.705 --> 15:15.915
[laughing]
For everybody.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.876
So yeah, let's get ready
for the show.

15:18.876 --> 15:20.169
Okay?

15:20.169 --> 15:21.170
Uh, yeah.

15:21.170 --> 15:24.549
So do your thing or whatever.

15:24.549 --> 15:25.800
‐ Thank you.
Thank you so much.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.301
I'm so excited
to share this with you.

15:27.301 --> 15:29.470
So sculpting is my medium...
‐ [whispering] Hey. Hey, Keef.

15:29.470 --> 15:30.972
SCULPTOR: You can see my mom
always said...

15:30.972 --> 15:32.557
‐ Is that Adrienne?

15:32.557 --> 15:35.059
SCULPTOR: I just wanna
turn this around here.

15:35.059 --> 15:37.603
‐ Yes.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.105
SCULPTOR: For two years

15:39.105 --> 15:40.857
and I really think this is
the one that's gonna get me...

15:40.857 --> 15:42.150
‐ Yes, it is.

15:46.529 --> 15:48.990
‐ This is made entirely

15:48.990 --> 15:50.575
of discarded IKEA materials.

15:50.575 --> 15:52.493
‐ Hi, stranger.
KEEF: Hey.

15:52.493 --> 15:55.079
‐ Didn't know you were here.
‐ Same here.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.290
‐ Hey, you still owe me
some toast, by the way.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.791
‐ He seems relaxed.

15:58.791 --> 16:01.210
Oh, look at your hair, Gunther.
It looks nice.

16:01.210 --> 16:03.254
‐ I took mushrooms.
‐ Got it.

16:03.254 --> 16:04.463
‐ Uh, listen,

16:04.463 --> 16:05.882
I'm a little bit hungry.
Y'all hungry?

16:05.882 --> 16:07.216
I think we should just
get out of here

16:07.216 --> 16:08.593
and grab something to eat,
you know?

16:08.593 --> 16:09.844
‐ What are you talking about?

16:09.844 --> 16:11.846
What, did I trip through
your entire presentation?

16:11.846 --> 16:14.056
‐ Oh, no.
That hasn't happened yet.

16:14.056 --> 16:15.308
‐ You're doing a presentation?

16:15.308 --> 16:16.517
‐ Am I?

16:16.517 --> 16:18.269
‐ Kept that under your hat.
‐ Yeah.

16:18.269 --> 16:20.771
ADRIENNE: Oh, my goodness.
Keef Knight.

16:20.771 --> 16:22.190
‐ I don't wanna talk
to you guys anymore.

16:22.190 --> 16:23.649
‐ Okay.
ADRIENNE: Cool.

16:23.649 --> 16:26.277
‐ Yeah, the presentation,
it's something that, you know‐‐

16:26.277 --> 16:28.029
ADRIENNE: You can tell me.
‐ I didn't know I was‐‐

16:28.029 --> 16:29.614
‐ You've wasted all our time.

16:29.614 --> 16:31.574
Frankly, I don't care
for any of it.

16:31.574 --> 16:33.409
I hope your return policy
on this art

16:33.409 --> 16:34.744
is better than IKEA's.

16:34.744 --> 16:36.954
Please, Lord, I hope
it gets better from here.

16:36.954 --> 16:38.331
Continue.
‐ Thank you.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.291
Uh...um, as, you can see...

16:40.291 --> 16:42.126
‐ Seems nice.
‐ Yeah, real nice guy.

16:42.126 --> 16:43.711
‐ Oh, that guy bought
a piece of my art.

16:43.711 --> 16:45.963
I gotta talk to him.
‐ Okay.

16:50.384 --> 16:52.386
SCULPTOR: Um,
so I'm really hoping

16:52.386 --> 16:54.639
on, uh, getting people
to come around...

16:54.639 --> 16:56.015
‐ Hey.
‐ No.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.391
I cannot with you right now.

16:57.391 --> 16:59.060
‐ First of all, it ain't got
nothing to do with me.

16:59.060 --> 17:00.436
Don't get mad at me
'cause your girl over there

17:00.436 --> 17:02.188
with Amber Rose.
AYANA: It's not just her.

17:02.188 --> 17:04.315
It's all these
fucking fake people.

17:04.315 --> 17:06.442
I'm just tired of everyone
acting like they're artists.

17:06.442 --> 17:07.693
‐ You know, honestly,
I'ma keep it real with you.

17:07.693 --> 17:08.986
I don't give a fuck

17:08.986 --> 17:10.154
about nothing
you're talking about right now.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.405
‐ Oh, okay.

17:11.405 --> 17:12.615
CLOVIS: You're focused
on the wrong stuff.

17:12.615 --> 17:14.033
She's not perfect.
‐ You don't know her.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.034
‐ Oh, my God.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.328
You know what, close your eyes.

17:17.328 --> 17:18.496
‐ This, like, a trap
or something?

17:18.496 --> 17:19.622
‐ Girl, I ain't trying
to trap you

17:19.622 --> 17:20.623
in front of all these
damn people.

17:20.623 --> 17:22.083
Close your eyes.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.751
‐ But if we were, like, alone,
you were gonna trap me?

17:23.751 --> 17:25.294
‐ Can you close your eyes?
I'm trying to help you. Damn.

17:25.294 --> 17:26.545
AYANA: All right.

17:27.838 --> 17:30.633
‐ All right.
Now, imagine your girl.

17:30.633 --> 17:32.552
You're laying in bed together,
you know,

17:32.552 --> 17:34.762
and her breath,
it smells like booboo.

17:34.762 --> 17:36.764
‐ Oh.
‐ Yeah, straight dookie.

17:36.764 --> 17:37.848
AYANA: Oh.
‐ Number two.

17:37.848 --> 17:39.141
AYANA: No.
‐ Yes.

17:39.141 --> 17:40.226
And then you go
and get in the shower.

17:40.226 --> 17:41.561
‐ Okay.
‐ All right,

17:41.561 --> 17:43.020
because you feel dirty now
'cause of her breath.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.063
‐ Yeah.
‐ And you come out,

17:44.063 --> 17:45.231
and she's dancing, right?

17:45.231 --> 17:46.816
Kicking in the mirror.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

17:46.816 --> 17:48.401
‐ But she's dancing
to Black Eyed Peas.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.777
‐ Mm.

17:49.777 --> 17:51.445
‐ Now imagine you come home
from work.

17:51.445 --> 17:53.531
She's in the house,
on your couch.

17:53.531 --> 17:54.657
‐ My couch.

17:54.657 --> 17:55.992
‐ And she's watching
<i>Full House.</i>

17:55.992 --> 17:57.326
‐ Mm.
‐ Laughing.

17:57.326 --> 17:58.661
[laughs]

17:58.661 --> 17:59.954
Like that shit funny.
‐ It's not.

17:59.954 --> 18:01.080
‐ What's her credit score?

18:01.080 --> 18:03.124
‐ I don't know.
‐ 4‐something?

18:03.124 --> 18:04.500
‐ Probably.
She's bad with it.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.752
‐ Now open your eyes.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.546
<i>Voilà.</i>

18:08.546 --> 18:11.048
‐ Damn.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

18:11.048 --> 18:12.425
Look how she digging
in her mouth.

18:12.425 --> 18:13.426
AYANA: Ugh.
CLOVIS: Yeah.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.845
You're welcome.
‐ Okay.

18:15.845 --> 18:17.388
Not as bad as I thought.

18:17.388 --> 18:19.140
‐ See, that's what
I've been trying to tell you.

18:19.140 --> 18:21.183
Damn.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.518
So you still gay?

18:22.518 --> 18:24.645
‐ Yeah, man.
Very gay.

18:24.645 --> 18:26.314
CLOVIS: Okay. Okay.
‐ Okay.

18:26.314 --> 18:28.608
‐ Yeah, that was probably
the worst day of my life.

18:28.608 --> 18:32.612
I'll never go
to the waterslides again.

18:32.612 --> 18:35.948
‐ [whimpering softly]

18:35.948 --> 18:37.283
‐ [sighs]

18:37.283 --> 18:38.868
You carry a lot of pain.

18:38.868 --> 18:40.036
‐ I can feel it.

18:40.036 --> 18:41.829
‐ Yeah.

18:41.829 --> 18:43.748
I'm a soldier, though,
you know?

18:43.748 --> 18:45.708
‐ Mm.
‐ Yeah.

18:45.708 --> 18:49.086
‐ Hey, what the heck
are you guys doing after this?

18:51.964 --> 18:55.426
‐ Hanging out with you?

18:55.426 --> 18:56.927
‐ Great.

18:56.927 --> 18:58.304
[both laugh]

18:58.304 --> 19:01.307
[applause]

19:01.307 --> 19:03.809
‐ My goal with this piece
is to reveal

19:03.809 --> 19:06.062
the blatant hypocrisy
of critics

19:06.062 --> 19:08.564
not being able to handle
their own criticism.

19:12.193 --> 19:13.986
‐ Hey, Ayana.
‐ Hi.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.446
‐ I am so sorry.
‐ Mm.

19:15.446 --> 19:18.741
‐ But, uh,
tonight's not my night.

19:18.741 --> 19:20.409
‐ Oh, okay.
‐ Yeah.

19:20.409 --> 19:23.162
‐ If you bail on me,
I'll never run your shit again.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.288
‐ Okay.
Good.

19:24.288 --> 19:25.331
‐ Okay?
‐ Okay.

19:25.331 --> 19:26.332
‐ Great.

19:26.332 --> 19:28.334
Wow, that was something.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.294
Give it up for Mirror Face.

19:30.294 --> 19:32.254
Yes, thank you.
Thank you.

19:32.254 --> 19:34.799
You can go.
Thank you, that's enough.

19:34.799 --> 19:35.800
[voice echoing]
And now for something

19:35.800 --> 19:37.343
completely different...

19:37.343 --> 19:39.512
[normal voice]
Cartoonist Keef Knight.

19:39.512 --> 19:40.805
[cheers and applause]

19:40.805 --> 19:42.390
Keef Knight, everyone.

19:42.390 --> 19:44.767
GUNTHER: That's my boy.
My boy.

19:44.767 --> 19:46.102
‐ Yeah, come on.
All right.

19:46.102 --> 19:47.269
‐ Right now?

19:47.269 --> 19:50.773
Thank you, Ayana, for such a...

19:50.773 --> 19:52.191
aggressive intro.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.317
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ Appreciate that.

19:53.317 --> 19:54.860
Um...hello.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.029
My name is, uh, Keef Knight,

19:57.029 --> 19:59.490
and, uh, I would like
to show you all

19:59.490 --> 20:00.908
some of my new stuff,

20:00.908 --> 20:04.412
um, which is, um, using humor

20:04.412 --> 20:07.790
to shed a spotlight
on the human condition,

20:07.790 --> 20:09.667
so...okay, yeah.

20:09.667 --> 20:13.504
My ne‐‐first piece is all about
my roommate.

20:13.504 --> 20:17.174
[grunts]

20:17.174 --> 20:19.802
Yeah, I call this one
<i>Back to the Future</i>

20:19.802 --> 20:23.556
because he does not like
new stuff.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.015
‐ That's me.

20:25.015 --> 20:27.685
‐ Oh.
‐ That's freaking me.

20:27.685 --> 20:29.228
‐ [clears throat]

20:29.228 --> 20:33.524
And this next series, actually,
is about my other roommate.

20:33.524 --> 20:37.111
Um, here we go.

20:37.111 --> 20:39.447
And...

20:39.447 --> 20:42.491
this is because he‐‐
[laughs]

20:42.491 --> 20:46.954
He lies a lot
and he hates women, so...

20:46.954 --> 20:48.664
‐ Them just jokes, y'all,
you know.

20:48.664 --> 20:51.333
[laughs]
You know, I love women.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.335
My mama a women.

20:53.335 --> 20:56.005
‐ I've been Keef Knight,
and that is my time.

20:56.005 --> 20:57.131
‐ Are you gonna show
the last one?

20:57.131 --> 20:58.382
‐ I'm sorry, what?

20:58.382 --> 20:59.925
‐ You have one more.
Do you wanna show it?

20:59.925 --> 21:01.343
<i>‐ ¿Qué?</i>
‐ You have one more board.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.428
I can see it right there.

21:02.428 --> 21:05.598
Do you wanna show it
to the audience?

21:05.598 --> 21:07.933
‐ Oh, yeah‐‐this thing?

21:07.933 --> 21:09.602
‐ We wanna see
the rest of his work, right?

21:09.602 --> 21:10.603
Come on.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.188
[chanting]
Show it, show it.

21:12.188 --> 21:15.065
ALL: Show it, show it, show it,

21:15.065 --> 21:18.819
show it, show it,
show it, show it.

21:18.819 --> 21:21.405
‐ Mm, okay.
[laughs nervously]

21:21.405 --> 21:22.948
Yikes.
All right, here we go.

21:22.948 --> 21:26.160
This one, um...oh, boy.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.453
Let's not even...

21:27.453 --> 21:29.747
uh, don't focus

21:29.747 --> 21:31.832
on the girlfriend character
at all.

21:31.832 --> 21:34.335
I mean, she was kind of just,
like, an afterthought.

21:34.335 --> 21:35.628
Yeah, so...

21:35.628 --> 21:37.421
[crowd muttering]

21:37.421 --> 21:40.466
‐ Kind of like you and me.
[scoffs]

21:40.466 --> 21:43.427
‐ Um...
[laughs awkwardly]

21:43.427 --> 21:46.138
Did you, uh, know
that swing dancing was invented

21:46.138 --> 21:48.349
in the Harlem Renaissance,
which is‐‐

21:48.349 --> 21:50.643
uh, and people don't know that,

21:50.643 --> 21:52.436
so I just thought
I'd teach you guys a lesson

21:52.436 --> 21:54.438
before I get out of here, so...

21:54.438 --> 21:56.524
‐ Why is her face so fucked up?

21:56.524 --> 21:59.443
‐ Uh, you know, just for‐‐for‐‐
for reasons.

21:59.443 --> 22:02.112
‐ But why though?

22:02.112 --> 22:03.948
‐ Art‐based reasons.

22:03.948 --> 22:05.157
Mainly for art...

22:05.157 --> 22:08.994
‐ The complexities
of toxic masculinity.

22:08.994 --> 22:10.621
Men are afraid of the future

22:10.621 --> 22:12.665
because the future is feminine.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.708
Man is afraid to face

22:14.708 --> 22:16.418
what they know is coming.

22:16.418 --> 22:18.337
An excellent portraiture

22:18.337 --> 22:20.548
of Black‐on‐Black love.

22:20.548 --> 22:21.799
Bravo, Keef Knight!

22:21.799 --> 22:22.883
Bravo.

22:22.883 --> 22:26.011
