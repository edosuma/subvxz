17:12.935 --> 17:14.505
I just don't understand
what's going on here.

17:14.623 --> 17:17.733
I mean, this whole thing
has gotten totally out of hand.

17:17.881 --> 17:20.013
I got to find out
who MallRat37 is.

17:20.111 --> 17:21.432
Oh, God!
It could be anybody!

17:21.513 --> 17:22.468
Brad, give me your phone!

17:22.557 --> 17:23.982
- No!
- Why not?

17:24.113 --> 17:26.098
Is it because <i>you're</i> MallRat37?

17:26.213 --> 17:28.464
Oh, my God!
It <i>is</i> you!

17:28.575 --> 17:29.807
Sue, stage slap!

[ Grunts ]

17:31.447 --> 17:33.160
Nice try,
but that is not gonna do it!

17:33.297 --> 17:34.894
This ends now!

17:36.152 --> 17:37.793
Can I have
everybody's attention, please?

17:40.370 --> 17:42.964
What is happening to us
as a society?

17:43.100 --> 17:44.995
What kind of world
do we live in

17:45.101 --> 17:47.180
where people
make nasty comments

17:47.343 --> 17:50.463
and don't even have the decency
to sign their name?

17:50.794 --> 17:53.385
Well, I am here today to say

17:53.467 --> 17:55.238
that we are not gonna
put up with it anymore.

17:55.330 --> 17:57.143
If people have
constructive criticisms,

17:57.273 --> 17:59.642
then, please,
just say them to my face.

17:59.842 --> 18:01.652
Your potatoes suck.

18:01.811 --> 18:03.835
I said
<i>"constructive</i> criticism."

18:03.924 --> 18:06.270
They taste like they've been
microwaved instead of baked.

18:06.390 --> 18:08.951
Okay, that's not true.
They are pre-baked in Kansas.

18:09.047 --> 18:10.782
But... my point is--

18:10.900 --> 18:13.991
I feel like the pictures
misrepresent the food.

18:14.069 --> 18:15.594
Well, they do have
food stylists,

18:15.706 --> 18:17.404
but that's just
good advertising.

18:17.494 --> 18:18.348
Man: The pop's flat.

18:18.451 --> 18:20.112
That's because it's 90% ice.

18:20.201 --> 18:21.740
Okay, that is
a corporate issue.

18:21.837 --> 18:23.290
T-they tell us
where to fill it.

18:23.368 --> 18:25.260
I hate
the cheap, plastic forks.

18:25.358 --> 18:27.186
We like <i>real</i> silverware.

18:27.276 --> 18:29.212
Well, so did we, but people
put them in the trash.

18:29.353 --> 18:31.390
Your <i>potatoes</i>

18:31.471 --> 18:32.701
You know, my Aunt Ginny said,

18:32.820 --> 18:34.348
"If you don't have
anything nice to say,

18:34.451 --> 18:35.645
don't say anything at all."

18:35.734 --> 18:36.954
Your aunt's stupid.

18:37.026 --> 18:38.221
She's actually dead.

18:38.299 --> 18:40.104
Why? Did she eat
one of your potatoes?

[ Laughter ]

Pbhhht.

I don't know how to do this
anymore, Axl.

18:48.882 --> 18:50.029
Do what?

18:50.348 --> 18:51.645
This.

18:52.301 --> 18:54.432
I mean, you say you want me
to treat you like an adult.

18:54.513 --> 18:57.246
You want to do whatever
you want, go wherever you want,

18:57.324 --> 18:59.323
you don't want me
asking you any questions,

18:59.464 --> 19:00.940
but you want me
to come and pick you up

19:01.031 --> 19:02.455
when your car breaks down.

19:02.651 --> 19:04.539
I mean, I'm confused.

19:04.728 --> 19:06.752
Am I your mom?
Am I not your mom?

19:06.914 --> 19:08.966
I-I-I don't know
what you want from me.

19:09.055 --> 19:10.848
You could've left me
some chips.

19:15.152 --> 19:17.161
You know,
just be honest with me.

19:17.263 --> 19:19.151
And, really, I don't even care
what your answer is.

19:19.334 --> 19:20.967
When you were staying
with the Donahues,

19:21.112 --> 19:22.882
did you think I'd be mad?

19:23.539 --> 19:25.270
Did you think I'd be hurt?

19:25.653 --> 19:28.425
I don't know. I guess I wasn't
really thinking about you at all.

I don't want you to be my mom

19:36.157 --> 19:37.265
or that
I don't want to see you.

It's just...

in my face a lot.

I mean, when you were my age,
didn't you parents bug you?

Yeah, but my parents
were annoying.

Listen, this is all
new territory for me, too, Axl.

Y-you're my first.
I'm kind of flying blind here.

19:55.009 --> 19:57.951
So help me out.
Tell me what you want.

- I don't know.

20:01.688 --> 20:03.684
You can ask me less questions.

20:04.695 --> 20:06.764
And when I call home,
you can maybe try

20:06.861 --> 20:09.243
not to tell me some long story

20:09.367 --> 20:11.307
about some kid
I was friends with in preschool

20:11.420 --> 20:12.826
who started a website.

20:13.459 --> 20:15.000
And you can stare at me less.

20:15.248 --> 20:18.261
Sometimes, I notice you
staring at me for no reason.

20:18.349 --> 20:19.702
If I'm staring at you,

20:19.871 --> 20:22.561
it's because I think you have
the most beautiful eyes

20:22.664 --> 20:24.277
and perfect rosy cheeks

20:24.390 --> 20:25.733
that you got
from your great-grandmother,

about more stuff
that's going on in my life

less when I come home.

worrying about you.

to be cooler about it.
