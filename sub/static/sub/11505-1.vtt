00:47.447 --> 00:49.415
I just feel really close to you.

00:50.750 --> 00:52.183
You are really close to me.

00:54.421 --> 00:57.913
<i>Well, this way we can share everything.</i>

01:03.163 --> 01:05.154
<i>Wow, that's so good.</i>

01:07.767 --> 01:08.961
Look.

01:09.602 --> 01:11.729
They're still so in love.

01:15.642 --> 01:18.236
How great is that?

01:22.148 --> 01:24.378
<i>So, where do you see us going?</i>

01:27.520 --> 01:30.250
<i>Well, tonight I see us
going back to my place.</i>

01:44.938 --> 01:45.905
Wow!

01:46.072 --> 01:48.006
- This is your house?
- Yeah.

01:48.441 --> 01:49.465
It's beautiful!

01:49.576 --> 01:50.873
Thank you.

01:50.977 --> 01:53.002
I like to come home to a nice place.

01:59.819 --> 02:02.014
I'm happy. Are you happy?

02:02.188 --> 02:06.090
<i>Oh, yeah. Happy is what I'm all about.</i>

02:08.127 --> 02:10.596
<i>Tripp, as long as you're up, Son...</i>

02:11.598 --> 02:15.329
<i>Come on, Pop! Whoa, man.
Don't you knock?</i>

02:15.435 --> 02:16.402
What?

02:16.503 --> 02:19.199
Your momma's...
She's snoring like a rhino.

02:19.305 --> 02:21.705
And then this music got started...

02:23.076 --> 02:25.306
<i>Hey, you must be Melody.</i>

02:26.012 --> 02:27.036
Melissa.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.944
Oh! Lt's Melissa!

02:30.783 --> 02:33.616
Lt's Melissa. Okay. All right.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.017
Y'all have a good time.

02:35.121 --> 02:36.611
<i>Night, Pop.</i>

02:40.793 --> 02:42.784
You live with your parents?

02:42.896 --> 02:44.523
Ls that a problem?

02:44.898 --> 02:46.490
Are you kidding me?

02:47.033 --> 02:48.261
And she's leaving.

02:48.368 --> 02:49.630
Stomping down the steps.

02:49.736 --> 02:51.601
Unbelievable! Parents?

02:51.704 --> 02:52.864
Putting on her coat.

02:52.972 --> 02:54.906
Did you move that umbrella stand?

02:55.008 --> 02:56.737
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

02:57.277 --> 03:01.043
We gotta get rid of that thing.
You know we're gonna get sued?

03:01.147 --> 03:02.205
Damn it!

03:02.749 --> 03:04.216
And she's out.

03:06.119 --> 03:07.643
Another one bites the dust.

03:07.754 --> 03:09.722
And he is still here.

04:03.876 --> 04:05.343
<i>- Morning, Mom.
- Morning.</i>

04:05.478 --> 04:06.536
<i>What do you say, Pop?</i>

04:06.646 --> 04:07.738
<i>Good morning, Son.</i>

04:07.847 --> 04:09.542
Get any sleep last night?

04:26.332 --> 04:30.166
<i>- Okay, honey, here you go.
- You're the best, Mom.</i>

04:41.948 --> 04:43.313
Are you kidding me?

04:46.919 --> 04:48.614
<i>- Have a good day.
- You, too.</i>

04:48.721 --> 04:51.155
- Don't forget your snack.
- Thanks.

04:52.859 --> 04:54.156
- Think fast!
- Bye!

05:18.951 --> 05:20.509
So you dumped Melissa?

05:20.620 --> 05:23.350
<i>Well, technically, she dumped me.</i>

05:24.691 --> 05:26.124
What happened?

05:26.225 --> 05:29.160
Lt was last night.
We were in a restaurant.

05:29.462 --> 05:32.454
<i>She sees this elderly couple
and they're holding hands,</i>

05:32.565 --> 05:36.057
and then she decides to hold my hand.

05:36.569 --> 05:39.402
So she smiles at me.

05:39.605 --> 05:43.735
<i>Next thing I know,
she gives me "the look. "</i>

05:45.078 --> 05:46.545
<i>Dude, I'm so sorry.</i>

05:46.646 --> 05:48.238
<i>No harm, no foul, though.</i>

05:48.481 --> 05:50.472
It was just time for her
to meet the parents.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.682
Not the parents.

05:52.785 --> 05:54.275
<i>Bye-bye, Melissa.</i>

05:54.554 --> 05:55.748
Here we go again.

05:55.855 --> 05:57.322
Yeah. What's your point?

05:57.423 --> 06:00.051
<i>The point is, my friend,</i>

06:00.426 --> 06:02.223
you are afraid of love.

06:02.729 --> 06:06.688
<i>Bullshit. No, no, no, no, no, man,
I'm not afraid of love.</i>

06:07.567 --> 06:10.866
<i>I love love.
Look, I've had a lot of girlfriends, right?</i>

06:10.970 --> 06:12.961
And sometimes I'm the rebound guy.

06:13.072 --> 06:14.471
<i>Other times, when I get lucky,</i>

06:14.574 --> 06:17.941
I'm the "explore new areas
of your sexuality" guy.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.444
<i>But every single time, we have fun.</i>

06:21.013 --> 06:22.275
Thank you.

06:22.382 --> 06:25.112
<i>I have fun, they have fun.
It's good for me, it's good for them.</i>

06:25.218 --> 06:28.051
And I would argue that's it's damn good
for civilization as a whole.

06:28.154 --> 06:29.644
If more people thought that way...

06:29.756 --> 06:30.848
I do sleep well at night.

06:30.957 --> 06:34.825
<i>On a twin bed, with Superman sheets
that you've had since you were six.</i>

06:34.927 --> 06:36.861
<i>As opposed to you,
who sleeps in a king-sized bed</i>

06:36.963 --> 06:38.021
in your mother's basement?

06:38.131 --> 06:39.655
<i>Lt's orthopedic, and I need it.</i>

06:39.766 --> 06:41.256
And at least I'm not sponging
off my parents

06:41.367 --> 06:43.267
so I can afford to get laid
on every continent.

06:44.337 --> 06:47.704
I'm a rambling man. I'm a tumbleweed.
I'm a seeker of truth.

06:47.807 --> 06:50.935
<i>And one truth I've learned,
a child is a parent's greatest joy.</i>

06:52.378 --> 06:53.936
<i>Which is why I can't leave
my parents' place,</i>

06:54.046 --> 06:55.308
because they would miss me!

06:55.415 --> 06:56.507
<i>Amen, brother!</i>

06:56.616 --> 06:59.016
<i>And yet, in America,
we're shunned for our lifestyle.</i>

06:59.118 --> 07:01.985
When we should be celebrating
our lifestyle.

07:02.388 --> 07:04.788
- We are men who still live at home.
- Yes!

07:04.891 --> 07:07.052
<i>We're not here to apologize
about who we are, or how we do it,</i>

07:07.160 --> 07:08.491
- or who we live with.
- No!

07:08.594 --> 07:11.859
<i>I'm looking around this table, hombres,
and I see three winners.</i>

07:11.964 --> 07:14.262
<i>And to every one of those out there
who sees something different,</i>

07:14.367 --> 07:15.800
I say bring it on!

07:15.902 --> 07:17.392
'Cause it's going to take
a stick of dynamite

07:17.503 --> 07:19.266
to get me out of my parents' house.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.101
The boy's 35 years old!

07:22.208 --> 07:23.300
Lt's just not fair.

07:23.409 --> 07:25.468
Thirty-five years!

07:25.578 --> 07:28.775
<i>We were good parents,
and now we're supposed to be done!</i>

07:28.881 --> 07:31.281
<i>Hey, I don't blame my kid for staying.</i>

07:31.384 --> 07:33.614
Our place is much nicer
than anything he can afford.

07:33.719 --> 07:35.311
<i>Well, our son's a flight attendant.</i>

07:35.421 --> 07:36.888
He travels so much
it doesn't make any sense

07:36.989 --> 07:38.251
- to have his own apartment.
- Yeah.

07:38.357 --> 07:41.155
Plus he has a lot of pilot friends
who let him stay over.

07:42.795 --> 07:46.128
<i>Well, I say the whole thing comes down
to being afraid to spank.</i>

07:46.232 --> 07:49.030
I mean you can't build a house
without a hammer!

07:49.135 --> 07:51.626
Anyone for a guava smasher?

07:52.071 --> 07:55.871
I learned to make them in Maui.
These really chase your troubles away.

07:55.975 --> 07:56.964
<i>Cheers, sweetie.</i>

07:57.076 --> 08:00.876
<i>And who is my hot little wahine, huh?</i>

08:02.682 --> 08:05.446
Bev? What is that?

08:05.852 --> 08:10.414
<i>Oh, I got this in Hawaii.
This is Lono, the god of fertility.</i>

08:12.592 --> 08:14.423
<i>Bud has one, too.
Do you want to see it?</i>

08:14.527 --> 08:16.188
- No!
- No!

08:16.562 --> 08:20.362
<i>No. I mean, what's going on here?</i>

08:21.634 --> 08:23.101
- Dougie moved out!
- Dougie moved out!

08:23.202 --> 08:24.464
- What?
- You're kidding.

08:24.570 --> 08:25.935
- Yes!
- When?

08:26.038 --> 08:27.733
<i>What, like two months ago!</i>

08:27.840 --> 08:29.569
Lt's been amazing!

08:29.675 --> 08:31.302
<i>Hey, how many times a week
do you think we do it?</i>

08:31.410 --> 08:32.433
<i>- Oh!
- Oh, Bud.</i>

08:34.746 --> 08:36.111
What? Oh!

08:36.682 --> 08:39.309
<i>I can't believe it. How'd you do it?
Dougie's a sweet kid, but...</i>

08:39.418 --> 08:42.318
How in the world did you get him
to move out?

08:44.390 --> 08:45.379
He met a girl.

08:45.491 --> 08:47.721
Met a girl?
Tripp meets a new girl every week.

08:47.827 --> 08:51.957
<i>Well, let's just say maybe he hasn't met
the right girl.</i>

08:56.536 --> 09:00.028
<i>Al, I don't want another recliner.
I want something new.</i>

09:00.139 --> 09:02.607
<i>Hey, here's something new!</i>

09:03.142 --> 09:04.507
Cup holders.

09:04.610 --> 09:07.010
That's not what I'm talking about.

09:07.246 --> 09:08.577
- Okay.
- That's nice.

09:08.681 --> 09:09.875
Get what you want.

09:09.982 --> 09:13.145
Just know that I'm going to be having
an affair within the next six months.

09:13.252 --> 09:16.244
<i>If I've gotta recline,
I'm making it interesting.</i>

09:16.355 --> 09:17.322
Deal.

09:17.423 --> 09:18.515
<i>Hey, gang.</i>

09:18.624 --> 09:21.354
<i>Let's stay on point here, huh?
We're picking out chairs.</i>

09:21.961 --> 09:24.452
<i>Hello, Dolly!</i>

09:24.564 --> 09:26.156
<i>Son, you see her?</i>

09:28.200 --> 09:29.599
Pop? Pick a chair.

09:29.702 --> 09:30.828
This is the one I want.

09:30.937 --> 09:32.632
<i>- Sold.
- No, that's polka dot.</i>

09:32.738 --> 09:34.103
We're not gonna put that in the house.

09:34.206 --> 09:35.195
<i>Pop, relax.</i>

09:35.341 --> 09:37.275
She's taking the chair with her
when she leaves you.

09:39.145 --> 09:40.407
We ain't buying that chair.

09:40.513 --> 09:42.743
I am getting this polka-dot chair.
I've got my own money.

09:42.848 --> 09:45.442
<i>Unless you start dancing again,
you're broke.</i>

09:48.154 --> 09:49.553
Excuse me.

09:49.655 --> 09:51.054
<i>- That's mine.
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

09:51.857 --> 09:53.381
You're buying that?

09:53.492 --> 09:54.481
No.

09:58.197 --> 10:00.290
<i>Want a cocktail, blanket or anything?</i>

10:00.399 --> 10:02.424
<i>No, I just need my 20 minutes.</i>

10:02.535 --> 10:04.469
- For what?
- To clear my head.

10:06.539 --> 10:08.404
I come here to relax.

10:09.041 --> 10:12.568
You know what helps me?
Put on the Food Network.

10:12.912 --> 10:14.675
Takes the edge right off.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.611
Gotta find what works for you.

10:19.518 --> 10:21.816
<i>Okay, look, the salesmen don't mind
because I bring them coffee,</i>

10:21.921 --> 10:23.786
and the music selection
is a soothing blend

10:23.889 --> 10:26.255
of mid-'70s singer-songwriters
and smooth jazz.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.293
It's practically narcotic.

10:28.394 --> 10:30.362
<i>And, usually, people leave me alone.</i>

10:30.463 --> 10:31.896
Sure they do.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.631
There's what you're talking about.

10:35.735 --> 10:36.895
<i>It's nice, huh?</i>

10:37.003 --> 10:40.336
<i>Yeah! I make fun of my parents,
but these babies are sweet.</i>

10:40.706 --> 10:42.435
- I'm Paula.
- I'm Tripp.

10:42.541 --> 10:45.066
<i>You know, usually I don't sleep
with someone on the first date.</i>

10:45.177 --> 10:47.304
I don't think this counts as a first date.

10:48.514 --> 10:51.483
It would be a date if you asked me
to have a drink tonight.

10:52.718 --> 10:54.151
Wanna have a drink tonight?

10:54.320 --> 10:56.515
Can't. How about lunch tomorrow?

10:56.622 --> 10:59.250
Sure. Wait. Tomorrow's Saturday.

11:00.426 --> 11:02.018
Sometimes I eat on Saturdays.

11:02.128 --> 11:04.221
<i>No, I'm doing something
with my nephew.</i>

11:04.830 --> 11:06.422
How about Monday?

11:08.567 --> 11:09.932
I'll meet you here.

11:10.536 --> 11:11.833
Beautiful.

11:23.683 --> 11:24.775
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

11:24.884 --> 11:27.216
<i>Hey, Paula.</i>

11:27.353 --> 11:30.186
<i>Good news, it's Champagne Thursday.</i>

11:30.523 --> 11:31.615
It's Friday.

11:31.724 --> 11:34.158
<i>Yeah, Thursday came twice this week.</i>

11:35.094 --> 11:36.925
For the third straight week.

11:37.029 --> 11:39.020
There's talk of making it permanent.

11:39.131 --> 11:40.792
Kind of like daylight-savings time?

11:40.900 --> 11:42.959
Right. But for booze.

11:43.836 --> 11:45.701
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

11:47.073 --> 11:48.768
<i>Shut up, you whore.</i>

11:50.576 --> 11:52.339
I'm sorry.
Was I sipping too loudly for you?

11:52.445 --> 11:53.605
<i>No, you're not sipping too loud.</i>

11:53.713 --> 11:56.341
It's that goddamn bird
outside my goddamn window.

11:56.449 --> 11:59.646
What the hell kind of devil bird
chirps at night?

12:02.722 --> 12:04.587
I think it sounds kind of pretty.

12:06.492 --> 12:07.925
You met a guy today.

12:08.027 --> 12:09.517
<i>As a matter of fact, I did.</i>

12:09.628 --> 12:10.925
<i>He's cute, too.</i>

12:11.030 --> 12:12.759
<i>I met a guy today, too.</i>

12:12.865 --> 12:14.025
Really?

12:14.900 --> 12:16.527
He's a radiologist.

12:16.635 --> 12:18.296
<i>Well, that's a step up.</i>

12:18.404 --> 12:21.373
<i>He offered to give me a full-body scan
next week, free of charge.</i>

12:21.474 --> 12:22.634
<i>Those don't come cheap, you know.</i>

12:22.742 --> 12:25.233
I know. I'm pretty excited about it.

12:28.981 --> 12:30.209
How cute?

12:32.318 --> 12:33.376
Cute.

12:33.886 --> 12:36.150
<i>Well, Tripp's a really nice guy.</i>

12:36.255 --> 12:39.349
<i>He's smart, he's sweet, he's funny.</i>

12:39.458 --> 12:42.586
We had a wonderful first meeting.
I see incredible potential here.

12:42.695 --> 12:44.219
So all systems are go?

12:44.330 --> 12:46.355
<i>Based on the initial
personality assessment,</i>

12:46.465 --> 12:48.933
I think that I can have your son
moved out of this house

12:49.034 --> 12:51.832
and living on his own by June 15th.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.103
Hallelujah!

12:54.707 --> 12:56.834
<i>Well, you know, you'd be amazed
at how many adult children</i>

12:56.942 --> 12:58.102
are still living at home.

12:58.210 --> 13:01.907
<i>Now, it's my opinion that the root cause
is a lack of self-esteem.</i>

13:02.014 --> 13:04.175
<i>Oh, Oprah talks about that all the time.</i>

13:04.283 --> 13:05.580
Oprah don't know crap!

13:05.684 --> 13:07.948
<i>Heck, when I was growing up,
nobody had self-esteem,</i>

13:08.053 --> 13:09.145
and we turned out fine.

13:09.255 --> 13:11.689
<i>You're a rock, Al.
You make me a better woman.</i>

13:11.791 --> 13:15.750
<i>Look, many young men who should
be able to move out, simply can't.</i>

13:15.861 --> 13:18.989
It's called "failure to launch. "
And that's where I come in.

13:19.098 --> 13:22.226
<i>Young men develop self-esteem best
during a romantic relationship,</i>

13:22.334 --> 13:24.097
so I simulate one.

13:24.203 --> 13:26.296
We have a memorable meeting.

13:26.505 --> 13:29.030
<i>We get to know each other
over a few casual meals,</i>

13:29.141 --> 13:30.870
<i>he helps me through
an emotional crisis,</i>

13:30.976 --> 13:32.307
<i>then I meet his friends,</i>

13:32.878 --> 13:34.505
<i>if he has any,</i>

13:34.613 --> 13:36.308
then I let him teach me something...

13:36.415 --> 13:37.905
<i>But the bottom line is,</i>

13:38.150 --> 13:39.117
he bonds with me.

13:39.318 --> 13:40.945
He lets go of you.

13:41.086 --> 13:42.519
He moves out.

13:43.422 --> 13:47.017
But how do you make sure
that he'll fall in love with you?

13:47.126 --> 13:49.219
<i>You look nice,
you find out what they like,</i>

13:49.328 --> 13:51.228
<i>and then you pretend to like it, too.</i>

13:51.330 --> 13:53.355
That is pretty much how it works.

13:54.934 --> 13:56.060
What about sex?

13:56.168 --> 13:58.295
<i>Al, I never have sex with a client.</i>

13:58.404 --> 14:01.498
<i>Besides, I need to keep Tripp motivated,</i>

14:01.807 --> 14:04.833
<i>and let's face it, after men have sex...</i>

14:06.312 --> 14:08.109
Is there anything that we need to do?

14:08.214 --> 14:11.240
<i>Well, for starters, you could make life
a little more difficult for him.</i>

14:11.350 --> 14:15.343
<i>You know, more chores,
more responsibilities, that kind of thing.</i>

14:15.454 --> 14:18.685
I just think you should know that Tripp
has had some rough breaks.

14:18.791 --> 14:20.850
<i>I promise you, when this is over,</i>

14:20.960 --> 14:23.793
<i>Tripp is going to be an independent,</i>

14:23.896 --> 14:26.057
self-sufficient adult.

14:27.166 --> 14:28.463
<i>Shut up, dude! Don't help him!</i>

14:28.567 --> 14:30.296
<i>- Watch the safety. No, no, no.
- No, he's in a run defense...</i>

14:30.402 --> 14:31.699
Don't do it! Don't do it! I got you!
I got you!

14:31.804 --> 14:33.829
- Throw it to Moss. Throw it to Moss!
- Watch out! I'm going deep!

14:33.939 --> 14:35.429
<i>No, you don't! Shit!</i>

14:35.541 --> 14:36.565
<i>That's a bad word, Jeffrey.</i>

14:36.675 --> 14:39.337
<i>So is "bastard," but that just means
your parents aren't married.</i>

14:39.445 --> 14:40.742
- Look at him! Look at him!
- No! Shit!

14:40.846 --> 14:42.143
He could go all the way!

14:42.248 --> 14:43.579
Touchdown!

14:43.682 --> 14:45.149
Yes!

14:45.718 --> 14:47.117
- Sit down!
- That's a face!

14:48.120 --> 14:49.178
<i>That's great, man.</i>

14:49.288 --> 14:50.755
That's good sportsmanship.
Nice dance.

14:50.856 --> 14:54.087
<i>Wow, my forehead itches.</i>

14:54.727 --> 14:58.060
<i>That's cool, the "L" for loser.
Keep it up, little man.</i>

14:58.163 --> 14:59.425
I'll make you walk home.

14:59.531 --> 15:00.691
<i>Hell, you are such a good uncle.</i>

15:00.799 --> 15:02.733
That's like eight miles.
It'll take you two days.

15:02.835 --> 15:03.995
<i>- Hey, boys.
- Hey.</i>

15:04.103 --> 15:05.570
<i>- Hi.
- Tripp, we're going out.</i>

15:05.671 --> 15:08.162
<i>All right, listen, you got any more
chips and salsa downstairs?</i>

15:08.274 --> 15:10.105
<i>Oh, I didn't get to the store.</i>

15:11.143 --> 15:12.110
But you could go.

15:13.545 --> 15:16.207
<i>And you said you needed
your basketball shorts,</i>

15:16.315 --> 15:17.714
so I put them in the laundry.

15:17.816 --> 15:19.943
<i>- Right. Thank you, babe.
- But I didn't get to it.</i>

15:20.052 --> 15:22.145
So you're going to need to do a load.

15:22.254 --> 15:23.346
A load?

15:23.455 --> 15:27.357
<i>And your bathroom needs cleaning,
so I left the stuff in the hall.</i>

15:27.459 --> 15:28.926
<i>And when you're done
with the rubber gloves,</i>

15:29.028 --> 15:31.258
just remember to turn them inside out.

15:31.664 --> 15:32.631
Bye.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.101
Something's wrong with your mom.

15:41.206 --> 15:42.833
This is really nice.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.910
I've never actually been
on a sailboat before.

15:45.010 --> 15:46.637
<i>Hey, I'd be fine</i>

15:46.812 --> 15:48.780
if I never set foot on solid ground again.

15:48.881 --> 15:51.509
<i>You know, I bet I'd really love it
if we ever left the dock.</i>

15:51.617 --> 15:52.743
<i>Well, yeah!</i>

15:52.851 --> 15:54.682
But to actually take you out on the water
on a first date

15:54.787 --> 15:56.379
<i>would be very forward of me, Paula.</i>

15:56.488 --> 15:58.956
<i>Well, so far I must say
I'm very impressed.</i>

15:59.058 --> 16:01.754
<i>Beautiful setting, a simple meal...</i>

16:02.094 --> 16:04.085
I assume this technique
has worked in the past?

16:04.296 --> 16:05.957
<i>Yes, ma'am, it has.</i>

16:06.298 --> 16:07.390
Is it working now?

16:07.499 --> 16:09.558
You know what? Lt kind of is.

16:12.871 --> 16:14.338
Let's go for a walk.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.533
But I'm not done with lunch.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.177
<i>Yeah, you are.</i>

16:21.480 --> 16:24.244
<i>Seriously, I'm not one of those girls
who don't eat. I want...</i>

16:24.350 --> 16:25.749
I wanted all of that.

16:25.851 --> 16:28.081
<i>See, technically, this is not my boat.</i>

16:28.187 --> 16:30.883
<i>Actually, it's not my boat in any way.</i>

16:31.390 --> 16:33.824
- What?
- I'm a boat broker. I sell boats.

16:33.926 --> 16:37.555
<i>I would love to own a boat like this,
but it's not the right time in my life.</i>

16:37.663 --> 16:40.063
<i>Besides, the guy
who does own this boat</i>

16:40.165 --> 16:41.894
is right behind you.

16:42.368 --> 16:45.531
<i>Hey there, Mr. Axelrod!
I thought you were out of town!</i>

16:45.637 --> 16:47.730
<i>Well, I was, and now I'm not.</i>

16:48.407 --> 16:51.240
What's going on? Ls that a fork?
Are you eating on my boat?

16:51.343 --> 16:52.310
No.

16:53.879 --> 16:55.506
When did you redo the galley?

16:57.916 --> 16:59.110
<i>Oh, you're in the market?</i>

16:59.218 --> 17:01.186
Might be. What's she draw?

17:01.286 --> 17:02.685
Seven-three.

17:03.255 --> 17:04.619
Cherry's a little dark.

17:05.124 --> 17:06.489
The wife picked it.

17:06.657 --> 17:08.022
It's got nice lines.

17:08.127 --> 17:09.685
<i>She's fast, too.</i>

17:10.729 --> 17:12.424
<i>Well, she certainly is yare.</i>

17:14.066 --> 17:16.090
I'll think about it. Thanks for your time.

17:16.201 --> 17:17.667
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

17:18.002 --> 17:18.970
Thank you.

17:22.074 --> 17:23.905
You're gonna let her walk away?

17:24.009 --> 17:26.409
<i>I'm giving her space, Mr. Axelrod.</i>

17:27.546 --> 17:28.740
<i>Now,</i>

17:30.015 --> 17:31.949
I'm going after her.

17:35.521 --> 17:39.548
<i>Excuse me, ma'am.
"She certainly is yare"?</i>

17:39.658 --> 17:40.989
<i>Philadelphia Story.</i>

17:41.093 --> 17:42.219
Sweet.

17:42.728 --> 17:46.630
<i>All right, assuming
that pretending to own a yacht</i>

17:46.732 --> 17:50.168
<i>was a brilliant, romantic,
yet ultimately flawed idea,</i>

17:50.269 --> 17:52.499
how do you see the rest of the date
playing out?

17:52.604 --> 17:56.836
I don't know. I'm so hungry I can't think.
Seagulls ate my lunch.

17:57.309 --> 17:58.674
What if I take you to a restaurant?

17:58.777 --> 18:00.335
Are you gonna pretend to own it?

18:00.446 --> 18:03.643
No. All the restaurants I own
are in Europe.

18:11.523 --> 18:13.718
<i>Well, hey there, Ace.
Glad you could make it, man.</i>

18:13.826 --> 18:14.918
We thought you went home.

18:15.027 --> 18:18.519
<i>I fell into a deep, dark crevasse.
I was so scared.</i>

18:19.331 --> 18:20.593
Did you go out with La-Z-Girl?

18:20.699 --> 18:22.826
Paula. I did. We had lunch.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.425
Will there be a second date?

18:24.536 --> 18:26.163
There will be a second date.

18:26.271 --> 18:28.239
Yet the relationship
is doomed to failure.

18:28.340 --> 18:30.740
Right. And why are we doomed?

18:32.077 --> 18:33.567
You live with your parents?

18:33.679 --> 18:34.668
He's right.

18:34.780 --> 18:38.238
Your entire life is set up perfectly
for ending relationships.

18:38.350 --> 18:39.476
We've been out one time.

18:39.585 --> 18:42.019
<i>She's a nice girl, I'm a nice guy,
we had fun.</i>

18:42.121 --> 18:44.214
<i>And I must tell you, son,</i>

18:45.491 --> 18:47.686
nothing is doomed.

19:14.219 --> 19:15.811
Gnarly crash!

19:16.155 --> 19:17.486
What are you doing?

19:18.557 --> 19:20.957
<i>Remember, we're the visitors here.</i>

19:25.831 --> 19:27.025
Come on.

19:27.199 --> 19:29.861
- Wow. You're feeding it a little peanut?
- Yeah.

19:29.968 --> 19:32.061
<i>He gets that stuff all the time, man.</i>

19:32.604 --> 19:33.798
This is what he wants.

19:33.906 --> 19:35.703
<i>You want a treat from the big city, boy?</i>

19:35.807 --> 19:37.741
<i>He's not a child, Tripp.</i>

19:38.977 --> 19:40.205
Look how peaceful he is.

19:40.312 --> 19:41.472
<i>Come here, little boy.</i>

19:41.580 --> 19:43.775
<i>You want a little bit of chocolate,
baby-boo-boo?</i>

19:43.882 --> 19:45.110
You're giving him a PowerBar?

19:45.217 --> 19:46.844
Everybody loves chocolate.

19:47.753 --> 19:49.152
<i>Tripp, he's saying no.</i>

19:49.254 --> 19:50.585
Look into my eyes.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.179
<i>He's saying no, Tripp.</i>

19:55.727 --> 19:58.423
Tripp? Tripp? Dude?

20:01.633 --> 20:02.861
Get off!

20:07.940 --> 20:09.771
What is he doing? Ls that a squirrel?

20:09.875 --> 20:11.274
<i>No, it's a chipmunk.</i>

20:15.013 --> 20:16.378
Watch the bike.

20:25.557 --> 20:27.889
<i>Oh, hey. I'm Tripp.</i>

20:28.827 --> 20:30.385
You must be Kit.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.298
It's a mockingbird.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.492
Who did what?

20:36.602 --> 20:38.001
Lt's a mockingbird.

20:38.103 --> 20:39.365
What is?

20:39.471 --> 20:42.235
You don't hear that?
That annoying noise.

20:42.507 --> 20:44.304
<i>Oh, yeah, now I hear it.</i>

20:44.409 --> 20:45.467
I looked it up.

20:45.577 --> 20:48.637
<i>They can imitate car alarms,
and telephones, and other birds.</i>

20:48.747 --> 20:50.612
<i>I called Animal Control,
and you know what they said?</i>

20:50.716 --> 20:54.482
They said I should just enjoy
one of nature's most talented singers.

20:54.586 --> 20:56.554
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna kill it.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.724
<i>Okay, I'm all set.</i>

21:00.058 --> 21:01.389
<i>- Oh, wow.
- Hi.</i>

21:01.493 --> 21:02.755
<i>Wow, look at you.</i>

21:02.861 --> 21:04.226
<i>Well, look at you.</i>

21:04.396 --> 21:05.761
Sweet shoes.

21:05.897 --> 21:07.592
Really? Thanks.

21:08.433 --> 21:10.901
<i>Okay, well, Kit, we're gonna go.
See you.</i>

21:11.003 --> 21:12.436
- You ready?
- Yeah.

21:12.537 --> 21:14.198
<i>Okay, you two kids have a blast.</i>

21:14.306 --> 21:17.207
<i>- Thanks.
- Hey, Kit, good luck with the...</i>

21:24.583 --> 21:26.244
It's a chipmunk bite.

21:26.351 --> 21:29.013
I figured.
Obviously not a normal chipmunk.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.145
You're right about that.

21:30.255 --> 21:34.851
<i>No, this was like a big, oversized, like,
bobcat, grizzly-bear chipmunk.</i>

21:35.027 --> 21:36.995
I'm pretty fortunate to still be here.

21:37.095 --> 21:38.255
- Wow.
- Yeah.

21:38.363 --> 21:39.330
What did the doctor say?

21:39.431 --> 21:40.523
I didn't need to see a doctor.

21:40.632 --> 21:43.328
I had some cream at home
that I put on it.

21:43.468 --> 21:45.527
- You had chipmunk cream?
- Yeah.

21:45.637 --> 21:47.229
<i>- Wow, that's lucky.
- Isn't it?</i>

21:49.408 --> 21:50.932
I take it you like Japanese food.

21:51.043 --> 21:52.340
<i>Oh, I love it.</i>

21:52.444 --> 21:54.878
<i>I'm also gonna order a huge dessert,
drink too much,</i>

21:54.980 --> 21:56.811
and maybe talk about my old boyfriends.

21:56.915 --> 21:58.473
- Yeah?
- Does that intimidate you?

21:58.583 --> 21:59.914
Not at all.

22:00.819 --> 22:01.911
<i>Cheers, Paula.</i>

22:02.020 --> 22:03.214
Cheers.

22:06.124 --> 22:10.288
<i>All right, T-R-I-double-P going in
to get a little squid.</i>

22:12.297 --> 22:13.821
Do you need me to help you with that?

22:13.932 --> 22:16.526
<i>I got it. I got it. Look at this, look at this.</i>

22:16.735 --> 22:17.997
I admire the confidence.

22:18.103 --> 22:20.071
Thank you. I am fairly...

22:21.139 --> 22:23.266
ambidextrous.

22:25.243 --> 22:26.403
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

22:26.511 --> 22:28.911
I'm sorry! Excuse me.

22:29.014 --> 22:30.572
Squid's a little bit greasy tonight.

22:30.682 --> 22:32.445
Sorry. Yeah.

22:32.551 --> 22:33.813
That's not easy to do.

22:33.919 --> 22:35.181
I didn't see anything.

22:36.855 --> 22:39.756
Tell me about yourself.
What do you do for a living?

22:41.360 --> 22:43.624
I teach special needs kids.

22:47.632 --> 22:48.621
- How's the hand?
- It's fine.

22:48.734 --> 22:49.758
- Is it throbbing?
- No.

22:49.868 --> 22:52.098
Is the medication wearing off?

22:52.838 --> 22:54.305
Gotta scratch.

22:56.308 --> 22:57.434
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

22:57.542 --> 22:58.509
<i>Well,</i>

23:00.212 --> 23:01.543
home again.

23:01.947 --> 23:03.039
Home again.

23:03.248 --> 23:04.272
I had a nice time.

23:04.383 --> 23:05.407
<i>I did, too.</i>

23:05.517 --> 23:06.711
Good.

23:06.885 --> 23:08.045
I had fun.

23:08.153 --> 23:09.211
Good.

23:11.022 --> 23:14.856
Shut up!
Shut up you crazy bastard bird bitch!

23:15.761 --> 23:17.092
<i>Hey, Kit!</i>

23:17.496 --> 23:18.724
What? Hi.

23:19.664 --> 23:21.188
Can you guys see me?

23:21.299 --> 23:22.266
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

23:22.367 --> 23:24.062
Oh. Great.

23:26.338 --> 23:27.396
What?

23:27.906 --> 23:29.533
Dinner and a show.

23:33.745 --> 23:35.076
Good night.

23:36.715 --> 23:37.783
Good night.

23:37.983 --> 23:39.974
<i>Now, what type of a boat
do you see yourself in?</i>

23:40.085 --> 23:41.313
<i>Well, I'm not sure.</i>

23:41.420 --> 23:43.581
But I do know that I need
to be out in the open sea.

23:43.688 --> 23:45.656
<i>Well, you gotta ask yourself
some questions.</i>

23:45.757 --> 23:47.384
Do you like speed?

23:47.592 --> 23:49.685
Do you like to hear
the roar of an engine?

23:49.795 --> 23:52.696
Do you want to get from point A
to point B as quickly as possible?

23:52.798 --> 23:54.663
<i>Lf that turns you on,
then you want a powerboat.</i>

23:54.766 --> 23:57.633
<i>Okay, that's it. That's it.
Power. That's me. Yes.</i>

23:57.736 --> 24:00.068
<i>Well, that's one way to go.
But maybe you want to slow down.</i>

24:00.172 --> 24:02.072
<i>You know, listen to the wind
and the water.</i>

24:02.174 --> 24:04.608
Have sunrise and sunset
as your only clock.

24:04.709 --> 24:06.438
Know that you could go
around the world

24:06.545 --> 24:08.672
on less than a tank of gas.

24:09.614 --> 24:13.573
<i>Now, if that sounds good to you,
then maybe you're sailors.</i>

24:13.685 --> 24:16.210
This is not a hobby. This...

24:16.688 --> 24:17.677
It's a lifestyle.

24:17.789 --> 24:20.451
<i>Well, now that is passion!</i>

24:20.559 --> 24:22.220
- What has happened to you?
- What's happened to me?

24:22.327 --> 24:23.988
I want to feel the wind.

24:24.095 --> 24:25.153
I do not want to feel...

24:25.263 --> 24:27.197
<i>I want to make the wind, okay? Look...</i>

24:27.299 --> 24:28.527
- Make the wind?
- Yeah. I'm not a sailor.

24:28.633 --> 24:30.191
You don't make wind
sitting on a boat in a dock.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.702
I'm a power guy. Power.
Like "power boat. "

24:32.804 --> 24:33.793
- You're a power guy?
- Excuse me.

24:34.039 --> 24:36.269
- I want to feel that beneath...
- Guys who drink Kahlua and cream

24:36.374 --> 24:38.239
<i>are not power guys, honey.</i>

24:38.343 --> 24:39.469
Tripp.

24:42.214 --> 24:44.205
<i>Whoa, slow down, slow down, Paula.</i>

24:44.316 --> 24:46.716
Mr. Fritz was my best friend

24:48.520 --> 24:50.511
since he was a little puppy.

24:51.223 --> 24:53.691
Just a little fur ball.

24:53.825 --> 24:57.317
He was too small
to even jump up on the bed

24:57.562 --> 24:59.052
and now he's...

25:00.932 --> 25:01.899
He's...

25:02.734 --> 25:04.429
Got a tissue or something?

25:07.272 --> 25:09.206
<i>- He saved my life, you know.
- He did?</i>

25:09.307 --> 25:13.368
<i>And now I can't do
anything for him, and I...</i>

25:29.694 --> 25:31.321
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

25:34.599 --> 25:36.590
I'm so glad you're here.

25:39.938 --> 25:41.701
<i>Yeah, of course I am.</i>

25:46.278 --> 25:48.405
Can I have a minute alone with him?

25:49.981 --> 25:51.073
Thank you.

25:51.182 --> 25:53.207
- I'll be right outside.
- Okay.

26:02.093 --> 26:03.321
<i>Thanks, Gretchen.</i>

26:03.428 --> 26:04.622
Anytime.

26:05.130 --> 26:07.621
<i>Gosh, Emotional Crisis Day
is so critical.</i>

26:07.732 --> 26:09.893
<i>I cry, he cries.</i>

26:10.001 --> 26:11.525
It totally bonds us.

26:11.636 --> 26:13.228
So how long do you think
he's gonna sleep for?

26:13.338 --> 26:15.306
Half an hour.
He's only here for some dental work.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.841
<i>Oh. What's his real name, anyway?</i>

26:17.943 --> 26:18.967
I don't know.

26:19.077 --> 26:21.238
I just clean their teeth
and chop their balls off.

26:27.419 --> 26:29.319
<i>God, that is so sad.</i>

26:29.421 --> 26:31.013
<i>Yeah, it was a beautiful dog, man.</i>

26:31.122 --> 26:32.521
She was devastated.

26:32.624 --> 26:35.024
<i>Well, this is exactly what she needs.
Good choice.</i>

26:35.126 --> 26:37.686
<i>- There she is. Hey, Paula.
- Hi.</i>

26:37.796 --> 26:40.356
<i>Paula, these are my good friends,
Demo and Ace. Guys, Paula.</i>

26:40.465 --> 26:41.591
<i>Hi, it's nice to meet you.</i>

26:41.700 --> 26:44.362
<i>- I'm so sorry for your loss.
- Come on, don't.</i>

26:44.469 --> 26:45.697
Thank you.

26:45.804 --> 26:48.102
- Nice suit. How you doing?
- Thank you. Hi.

26:48.373 --> 26:52.639
<i>You know, most guys would've
sent flowers, chocolates maybe,</i>

26:52.744 --> 26:56.077
<i>but I gotta say,
I did not see this coming.</i>

26:56.181 --> 26:58.911
<i>Well, you know,
anybody can send flowers, Paula.</i>

26:59.017 --> 27:01.918
<i>Now, I'm going to let you in
on "the" secret.</i>

27:02.053 --> 27:05.147
<i>It's called the "finger roll. "
Quick fingers, light on the trigger.</i>

27:05.256 --> 27:06.985
<i>See, double trigger...</i>

27:07.459 --> 27:10.485
More paintballs in less time
means victory.

27:10.595 --> 27:11.857
Let's see it.

27:11.963 --> 27:13.123
When you're out there today

27:13.231 --> 27:16.200
<i>and you got these paintballs
flying at you at over 200 miles an hour,</i>

27:16.301 --> 27:20.032
<i>I guarantee you will not be thinking
about the late, great Mr. Fritz.</i>

27:20.905 --> 27:23.772
Holy moly. They really move that fast?

27:25.377 --> 27:26.742
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

27:28.513 --> 27:29.605
I'm so sorry!

27:29.714 --> 27:30.840
Nice shot!

27:30.949 --> 27:32.507
<i>- Oh, thanks.
- He's okay.</i>

27:36.988 --> 27:38.751
<i>Let's go shoot some strangers, huh?</i>

27:45.830 --> 27:48.492
First one to paint the skirt gets a beer.

27:48.800 --> 27:52.201
I think that guy just laughed at me.
Who are these guys?

27:52.303 --> 27:54.203
They go by "Devil Babies. "

27:54.305 --> 27:56.330
They finished third
in the National Championship.

27:56.441 --> 27:58.102
This should be an excellent test
of our skills.

27:58.209 --> 28:00.302
<i>- Wait. These guys are champions?
- All right, all right.</i>

28:00.412 --> 28:02.107
They didn't win it.

28:03.515 --> 28:04.504
Go!

28:04.949 --> 28:06.143
<i>Move, move, move!</i>

28:06.251 --> 28:07.582
Let's go!

28:09.788 --> 28:11.187
<i>Oh, my God! Oh, my God!</i>

28:11.423 --> 28:12.390
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

28:12.691 --> 28:14.591
<i>Let's go! Go, go, go, go!</i>

28:19.164 --> 28:21.462
There you are! Look alive!

28:22.033 --> 28:23.000
I'm out.

28:24.903 --> 28:26.336
- Watch out!
- Watch it!

28:26.438 --> 28:28.030
<i>Come on, blondie!</i>

28:43.788 --> 28:45.016
Am I out?

28:56.935 --> 28:59.301
I didn't know they sold beer here.

29:00.505 --> 29:01.631
They don't.

29:04.509 --> 29:07.444
<i>There you go! Stay down, Paula!
Stay down!</i>

29:11.483 --> 29:12.973
Can I have one?

29:14.753 --> 29:15.742
No.

29:15.954 --> 29:17.046
Check it out!

29:27.132 --> 29:28.599
<i>Warm day, huh?</i>

29:36.474 --> 29:37.941
Nice talking to you.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.077
Damn it!

29:43.715 --> 29:44.739
Paula?

29:44.849 --> 29:46.441
Sorry! Sorry!

29:46.551 --> 29:48.416
Does it count if it was an accident?

29:49.621 --> 29:50.849
Bad finger roll.

29:50.955 --> 29:52.820
<i>All right, I need you to come to me.</i>

29:52.924 --> 29:55.825
<i>No, thanks. I'm just gonna
stay over here till it's over.</i>

29:55.927 --> 29:56.951
- Now!
- Okay.

30:01.432 --> 30:02.421
I'm out.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.202
Shit! I'm out!

30:06.304 --> 30:08.898
- You will not have died in vain!
- Stay down.

30:09.007 --> 30:11.032
<i>Paula, where are you?</i>

30:11.543 --> 30:13.841
Finger roll. Finger roll. Finger roll.

30:13.945 --> 30:17.904
<i>Oh, Tinkerbell!
Come out, come out, wherever you are!</i>

30:18.983 --> 30:21.645
<i>The sooner you lose,
the sooner you can go shopping!</i>

30:24.289 --> 30:25.654
<i>Oh, man!</i>

30:25.890 --> 30:27.755
Who's laughing now?

30:31.596 --> 30:32.927
You did it!

30:34.465 --> 30:35.830
<i>- Get out of here!
- Boy, you made it!</i>

30:35.934 --> 30:36.992
Come on!

30:37.101 --> 30:38.329
Where'd that come from?

30:38.469 --> 30:40.027
- Look at you!
- I love it.

30:40.138 --> 30:41.503
<i>- Hey, Kit!
- Kind of fun, huh?</i>

30:41.606 --> 30:44.234
You know what?
I'm gonna go powder my nose.

30:45.343 --> 30:47.811
I take it you're over
your dead golden retriever.

30:47.912 --> 30:50.745
<i>You know, if I really had a dog
and he really had died,</i>

30:50.849 --> 30:53.215
I think this would have totally helped.

30:53.318 --> 30:55.616
<i>Man, she's got good spatial awareness.</i>

30:55.854 --> 30:56.912
And great hair!

30:57.021 --> 30:58.613
<i>- Thanks.
- She's a keeper, man.</i>

30:58.723 --> 31:00.816
<i>She's really great. Really great, Tripp.</i>

31:00.925 --> 31:02.517
So can we go now?

31:03.428 --> 31:04.895
Meeting the friends is very important.

31:04.996 --> 31:06.964
<i>Guys need to know
we not only like them,</i>

31:07.065 --> 31:09.033
<i>but we like their friends, too.</i>

31:09.133 --> 31:12.102
Fine. The tall one's kind of cute.
What's he do?

31:12.203 --> 31:13.761
<i>Oh, he's some kind of software writer.</i>

31:13.872 --> 31:15.499
<i>He works out of his basement,
but he makes a lot of money.</i>

31:15.607 --> 31:17.268
<i>Oh, you know what?
No, that's the little guy.</i>

31:17.375 --> 31:20.037
The tall one just got fired from Kinko's.

31:21.913 --> 31:23.437
How will I choose?

31:23.548 --> 31:25.072
This is going very well.

31:25.183 --> 31:27.310
Good. So we can go now.

31:28.086 --> 31:29.849
Not until I get "the nod. "

31:29.954 --> 31:33.151
<i>Lf I don't get "the nod,"
the friends undermine.</i>

31:35.059 --> 31:37.027
I think you're getting "the nod. "

31:39.430 --> 31:40.397
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

31:40.765 --> 31:43.598
<i>Oh, Tripp is just cruising
through the steps.</i>

31:43.701 --> 31:48.001
<i>In fact, I think tomorrow
I'm gonna let him teach me something.</i>

32:00.718 --> 32:03.118
<i>Now, basically there's two ways
to turn a boat.</i>

32:03.821 --> 32:06.221
<i>There's "coming about,"
which is turning into the wind,</i>

32:06.324 --> 32:08.554
<i>and there's "jibing,"
which is turning away from the wind.</i>

32:08.660 --> 32:11.595
<i>Now, jibing is something that you
never want to do with a rookie onboard,</i>

32:11.696 --> 32:13.459
<i>so let's give it a shot, huh?</i>

32:13.564 --> 32:15.964
<i>Well, wait, wait, wait.
Why is jibing bad?</i>

32:16.067 --> 32:18.399
<i>Lt's not bad, it's just fun. Jibe ho!</i>

32:18.503 --> 32:20.528
<i>Come on, babe! Let's get over there!</i>

32:24.943 --> 32:26.501
<i>Come on, boy!</i>

32:32.684 --> 32:33.810
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

32:34.552 --> 32:37.715
Nothing like the threat of decapitation
to make it a little more interesting.

32:40.024 --> 32:43.221
<i>Make off this sheet, like so.</i>

32:46.297 --> 32:47.264
Okay.

32:48.733 --> 32:51.224
"Jibe ho" and "making off the sheet"?

32:51.336 --> 32:54.897
That's too many words to learn.
I just want to get a suntan.

32:55.340 --> 32:56.398
<i>Here, take the wheel.</i>

32:56.507 --> 32:58.202
What? Really?

32:58.309 --> 32:59.298
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

32:59.410 --> 33:00.434
All right.

33:00.545 --> 33:02.274
- We call it the helm.
- Okay.

33:02.380 --> 33:03.745
<i>Wait, wait, wait! What are you doing?</i>

33:03.848 --> 33:05.145
I'm going down below.

33:05.516 --> 33:06.574
What's down below?

33:06.684 --> 33:08.413
<i>I don't know, beer, wine, chips, rum.</i>

33:08.519 --> 33:10.146
I don't know. It's not my boat.

33:10.355 --> 33:12.482
But I don't know what I'm doing!
I'm not kidding! Seriously!

33:12.590 --> 33:13.852
You're sailing!

33:13.958 --> 33:15.425
What if I hit something?

33:21.666 --> 33:23.634
I think you'll be okay. Fly.

33:24.302 --> 33:25.269
Wow.

33:27.038 --> 33:28.096
I'm sailing.

33:42.854 --> 33:43.980
<i>Oh, man.</i>

33:44.722 --> 33:46.485
That's gorgeous!

33:56.701 --> 34:00.137
<i>You know, I thought going on a boat
was a good idea because you like it,</i>

34:00.238 --> 34:03.401
but my God! That was great!

34:03.608 --> 34:07.476
<i>You should buy that boat! I mean,
I'm sure it's expensive, but so what?</i>

34:08.713 --> 34:11.375
<i>Well, I like that boat, but I really don't...</i>

34:11.649 --> 34:12.809
Nice.

34:13.851 --> 34:15.512
I don't really want a new boat.

34:15.620 --> 34:18.646
What I would love
is an old wooden boat.

34:18.822 --> 34:22.589
<i>Now, they're a lot more upkeep,
but when you're on one of those,</i>

34:22.827 --> 34:25.694
<i>it's like you're part of something,
you know?</i>

34:27.165 --> 34:30.828
<i>Lt's like you're connected, you know,
to the original seafaring people</i>

34:30.935 --> 34:33.199
<i>who set sail into the unknown
and said things like,</i>

34:33.304 --> 34:35.397
<i>"Holy crap, that's a big wave!"</i>

34:37.408 --> 34:39.774
So do it. Buy a crummy old boat.

34:40.210 --> 34:41.940
<i>Who cares,
as long as you're out there?</i>

34:42.045 --> 34:44.139
<i>Well, I'm working on it.</i>

34:45.016 --> 34:47.643
<i>The thing is, you gotta be ready.
I mean, it's a big commitment.</i>

34:47.752 --> 34:49.844
<i>And if you're not ready, you just end up,</i>

34:49.954 --> 34:52.786
<i>well, a lonely guy
with a big boat payment.</i>

34:53.123 --> 34:54.955
Who says you have to be lonely?

35:25.089 --> 35:27.614
<i>- Hey.
- Oh, hey! Hi!</i>

35:27.725 --> 35:28.953
I didn't know you were home.

35:29.060 --> 35:32.052
<i>Yeah, everyone from work
went to T.G.I. Friday's,</i>

35:32.163 --> 35:34.461
but I don't really like that place.

35:34.565 --> 35:36.726
<i>- Or anyone I work with.
- Oh, good.</i>

35:36.834 --> 35:39.894
So then we can stay in and watch
one of those drinking movies you like.

35:40.004 --> 35:41.130
Yeah.

35:45.610 --> 35:47.077
I smell something.

35:47.912 --> 35:49.504
Do you smell something?

35:51.582 --> 35:54.176
<i>Oh, Tripp and I had crab today.</i>

35:54.485 --> 35:56.112
<i>No, that's not it.</i>

35:57.121 --> 35:58.952
I smell fun.

36:01.292 --> 36:02.350
What?

36:02.460 --> 36:04.951
You are a dirty little fun-haver.

36:05.062 --> 36:08.657
That is absurd.
Tripp is a fascinating case.

36:08.766 --> 36:11.257
He doesn't fit the usual profile.

36:11.369 --> 36:12.393
Of losers and shut-ins?

36:12.503 --> 36:14.596
I actually don't even see
why he still lives at home.

36:14.705 --> 36:17.299
<i>He's got a good job,
he's got normal social skills,</i>

36:17.408 --> 36:19.569
<i>he's attractive,</i>

36:19.977 --> 36:21.945
he's really sweet.

36:24.282 --> 36:28.776
That's so nice that you get to hang out
with such a sweet guy every day.

36:32.290 --> 36:36.659
It was a rewarding
and successful work day. That's all.

36:36.761 --> 36:37.728
Okay.

36:37.828 --> 36:41.491
<i>And at the end of it,
I looked into his eyes,</i>

36:42.166 --> 36:43.133
and I saw it.

36:44.168 --> 36:45.601
I've got him.

36:46.237 --> 36:49.400
He is as good as moved out.

36:50.808 --> 36:53.368
It's over. She's gotta go.

36:53.544 --> 36:54.704
You're dumping Paula?

36:54.812 --> 36:57.337
- What happened?
- Same thing that always happens.

36:57.448 --> 36:59.006
<i>Everything is going along
nice and smooth,</i>

36:59.116 --> 37:00.105
<i>we're having a good time,</i>

37:00.218 --> 37:02.686
<i>and all of a sudden, out of nowhere...</i>

37:02.987 --> 37:04.113
She gets serious.

37:04.222 --> 37:07.953
<i>I hate to say it, boys,
but it is time to take the girl home.</i>

37:08.059 --> 37:09.788
- You're doing it again.
- What?

37:09.894 --> 37:13.830
The thing where the woman gets close
and you pull the relationship ripcord.

37:13.931 --> 37:16.331
<i>Guys, it's simple. The fun's gone.</i>

37:17.435 --> 37:19.426
<i>Hey, guys, check this out!</i>

37:21.272 --> 37:22.500
<i>Hey, boy!</i>

37:24.208 --> 37:26.472
<i>Come here, boy. Come here, boy.</i>

37:27.678 --> 37:28.906
<i>What's he saying, Demo?</i>

37:31.749 --> 37:32.773
Where'd you go?

37:32.883 --> 37:33.907
Where'd he go?

37:34.018 --> 37:36.213
<i>- Let me ask you something, Demo.
- Yeah.</i>

37:36.320 --> 37:38.948
How's this surfing
if there are no waves?

37:41.826 --> 37:42.793
Tripp?

37:49.233 --> 37:50.393
Should we go after him?

37:50.501 --> 37:51.661
<i>Well, he's their passenger now.</i>

37:51.769 --> 37:54.966
Passenger?
He just took him underwater!

37:55.673 --> 37:56.901
Take me!

38:00.444 --> 38:01.672
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

38:02.146 --> 38:04.637
<i>Oh, shit! The son of a bitch bit me!</i>

38:07.551 --> 38:09.712
So you were bit by a dolphin?

38:09.820 --> 38:12.948
<i>Yeah. And not just any dolphin, either.</i>

38:13.057 --> 38:15.719
<i>This was a great white dolphin,
all right?</i>

38:16.594 --> 38:18.289
I'm lucky to still be here.

38:23.768 --> 38:24.928
What?

38:27.338 --> 38:28.532
Nothing.

38:32.710 --> 38:33.677
Wow!

38:34.478 --> 38:36.207
- This is your house?
- Yeah.

38:36.314 --> 38:38.214
- It's beautiful.
- Thank you.

38:38.783 --> 38:41.274
I like to come home to a nice place.

38:43.454 --> 38:45.649
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

38:48.225 --> 38:49.852
- It's very pretty.
- Thank you.

38:49.960 --> 38:51.689
<i>- You want something to drink?
- Yeah, sure.</i>

38:51.796 --> 38:53.263
Beer? Glass of wine?

38:53.364 --> 38:54.956
<i>- Sure, wine would be great, thanks.
- Glass of wine.</i>

38:55.066 --> 38:56.033
Thanks.

38:56.233 --> 38:59.100
<i>Hey, Mom, Pop,
I thought y'all were going out.</i>

38:59.203 --> 39:03.003
Out? What would we go out for?
We've got those brand-new chairs!

39:04.775 --> 39:05.901
Hello.

39:09.647 --> 39:12.172
<i>Tripp, who's your little friend?</i>

39:12.283 --> 39:13.773
<i>Mom, Dad, this is Paula.</i>

39:13.884 --> 39:17.411
<i>Paula, this is my mom, my dad,
Sue and Al.</i>

39:17.822 --> 39:20.188
Wow! Well!

39:20.291 --> 39:22.020
- Hello. How do you do?
- Hello.

39:22.126 --> 39:23.286
Hi.

39:24.095 --> 39:26.086
It's a great pleasure to meet you both.

39:26.197 --> 39:27.494
<i>Hi, Paula.</i>

39:29.467 --> 39:30.434
Wow.

39:37.441 --> 39:38.567
So you...

39:39.176 --> 39:40.871
You live with your parents.

39:44.115 --> 39:45.446
Is that a problem?

39:52.390 --> 39:53.948
No.

39:55.459 --> 39:56.721
Not for me.

39:58.362 --> 40:00.262
Would you like to stay for dinner?

40:00.398 --> 40:03.424
Oh! Wow. I'd love to. Thank you.

40:03.534 --> 40:04.796
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Why?</i>

40:04.902 --> 40:08.497
<i>Well, it smells good,
and I'm really hungry. Aren't you?</i>

40:08.606 --> 40:11.769
<i>Yeah, I'm hungry.
But my mom here, she's cooking dinner.</i>

40:11.876 --> 40:13.366
Like she does most nights.

40:13.544 --> 40:15.205
<i>Right here, where I live,</i>

40:15.312 --> 40:16.540
<i>with them,</i>

40:17.715 --> 40:19.979
in the same house I grew up in.

40:20.618 --> 40:22.017
That's nice.

40:23.287 --> 40:25.084
I'm gonna go mow the lawn.

40:25.222 --> 40:27.019
<i>Well, we're about to sit down...</i>

40:27.124 --> 40:29.319
<i>Might mow the neighbor's, too.</i>

40:31.128 --> 40:33.995
Is this really okay? 'Cause I don't want
to intrude on family time.

40:34.098 --> 40:36.396
<i>Oh, it's fine. I'll set another place.</i>

40:36.500 --> 40:37.933
<i>Okay, thanks.</i>

40:39.937 --> 40:41.768
I'm gonna go help Dad.

40:42.640 --> 40:43.607
Is there...

40:44.708 --> 40:46.107
Is there anything I can do to help?

40:46.210 --> 40:48.576
<i>Listen, I am so sorry.</i>

40:48.679 --> 40:52.080
I had no idea that he was
going to bring me over here.

40:52.383 --> 40:54.578
But you are doing great.

40:54.685 --> 40:57.711
<i>Well, you're not.
I don't know what to tell you, honey,</i>

40:57.822 --> 41:00.188
but that strict program of yours?

41:00.724 --> 41:02.817
You're gonna have to start deviating.

41:02.927 --> 41:04.258
He's breaking up with you.

41:04.361 --> 41:05.350
What?

41:05.463 --> 41:07.863
The only reason
he ever brings girls home to meet us

41:07.965 --> 41:09.762
is 'cause he's getting ready
to dump them.

41:09.867 --> 41:11.027
Really?

41:12.770 --> 41:13.737
<i>Well,</i>

41:14.638 --> 41:15.730
that's not happening.

41:19.710 --> 41:22.508
<i>- Hey, Paula? Hey, sweetie?
- Yes?</i>

41:22.613 --> 41:26.140
<i>I appreciate you staying
for dinner, all right?</i>

41:26.250 --> 41:27.808
And I know that must have been
very awkward.

41:27.918 --> 41:29.215
Not at all.

41:29.320 --> 41:30.582
Not at all?

41:35.059 --> 41:37.391
You don't mind that my parents
are downstairs right now?

41:37.495 --> 41:39.326
They're asleep in their chairs.

41:41.131 --> 41:42.257
Don't stare.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.867
I'm paying for it. I'll stare if I want to.

41:49.907 --> 41:52.205
<i>I'm just saying, you know, they might...</i>

41:52.643 --> 41:54.406
They might hear us.

41:54.512 --> 41:57.345
Why? Are you a screamer?

42:32.950 --> 42:34.076
Paula?

42:37.321 --> 42:40.449
<i>Hey, you're up! Wow, early risers.</i>

42:40.558 --> 42:43.322
<i>Hey, listen.
FYI, work-wise, we're definitely on track.</i>

42:43.427 --> 42:44.894
Things are good. Tripp is good.

42:44.995 --> 42:46.656
<i>Well, actually, he's fantastic.</i>

42:46.764 --> 42:48.994
<i>Of course, I don't need to tell you that.
You're his parents.</i>

42:49.099 --> 42:53.229
<i>I'm just trying to say, you should be
very proud of him.</i>

42:54.471 --> 42:55.438
Well...

42:56.240 --> 42:58.071
You got a lovely home.

43:06.882 --> 43:08.816
<i>I'm sorry, miss, you're not allowed
to eat that in the store.</i>

43:08.917 --> 43:09.975
Fine.

43:37.078 --> 43:39.979
I need to buy a gun.
How much is this big gun here?

43:40.081 --> 43:43.812
That's a 12-gauge shotgun.
That's a pretty powerful weapon.

43:43.919 --> 43:45.409
<i>You know, for a woman your size,</i>

43:45.520 --> 43:47.886
<i>I'd probably recommend something
a little, you know...</i>

43:47.989 --> 43:48.978
More compact?

43:49.090 --> 43:52.253
<i>So I just point, and then I squeeze
the trigger and then boom.</i>

43:52.360 --> 43:55.090
Yeah. What did you say
you were shooting?

43:55.197 --> 43:58.894
Twelve hundred bucks? Wow.
How much are the bullets for this?

44:02.571 --> 44:05.540
Shells. Shotguns use shells.
Anyway. Whatever.

44:05.640 --> 44:07.631
They're 15 bucks for a box of 25.

44:07.742 --> 44:10.506
<i>Okay, I don't need a whole box.
I just need...</i>

44:11.980 --> 44:12.947
one.

44:16.017 --> 44:16.984
<i>You know,</i>

44:20.188 --> 44:22.179
<i>I get sad sometimes, too.</i>

44:23.658 --> 44:26.149
<i>So many pressures in life, you know?</i>

44:26.795 --> 44:30.026
Can I give you a phone number
for some people who can help...

44:30.131 --> 44:31.655
<i>Oh, no.</i>

44:31.766 --> 44:33.097
It's like a hotline.

44:33.201 --> 44:36.568
<i>Listen, sunshine, I'm not</i>

44:36.671 --> 44:38.298
<i>- suicidal.
- No, I know.</i>

44:38.406 --> 44:42.035
I just have a problem
with a mockingbird.

44:42.410 --> 44:43.707
<i>Okay,</i>

44:43.812 --> 44:46.906
- you can't kill a mockingbird.
- Why not?

44:47.015 --> 44:49.882
<i>Well, for one, there's the book
To Kill a Mockingbird.</i>

44:50.352 --> 44:52.047
<i>A copy of that, too, right here.</i>

44:52.153 --> 44:56.351
<i>No, it's not a manual
on how to kill mockingbirds.</i>

44:56.458 --> 44:59.791
It's a classic American novel.
How do you not know this?

45:00.562 --> 45:02.291
I know a lot of other things.
Give me the gun!

45:02.397 --> 45:03.386
- No!
- Yes!

45:03.498 --> 45:04.795
I'm not gonna sell you this gun.

45:04.900 --> 45:07.892
Mockingbirds are protected under
the Federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act.

45:08.003 --> 45:09.095
Killing one is a crime.

45:09.204 --> 45:10.967
<i>Look, this is insane.</i>

45:11.106 --> 45:12.505
<i>I have rights, too, you know.</i>

45:12.607 --> 45:14.939
Or maybe you haven't heard
of the Sixth Amendment!

45:15.043 --> 45:17.568
The right to a speedy and public trial?

45:19.347 --> 45:21.281
<i>You. You're on my list,</i>

45:21.516 --> 45:22.483
Jim.

45:22.684 --> 45:26.142
I got great boat shoes.

45:26.254 --> 45:27.243
Hi.

45:28.290 --> 45:30.258
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

45:30.358 --> 45:32.986
I got shoes for the next time
Tripp and I go sailing.

45:33.094 --> 45:34.789
And they're not just cute.

45:34.896 --> 45:36.363
Tripp says they're actually
very practical.

45:36.464 --> 45:37.761
They have these little ridges
on the bottom...

45:37.866 --> 45:39.424
<i>Wait, wait, wait, slow down.</i>

45:39.534 --> 45:40.592
Look at me.

45:40.702 --> 45:44.069
- What happened last night?
- What happened last night?

45:44.472 --> 45:46.099
I tried to end it.

45:46.308 --> 45:48.173
<i>Tried, as in "you failed"?</i>

45:48.276 --> 45:49.368
Yeah.

45:50.278 --> 45:52.610
But the sex was fantastic.

45:52.714 --> 45:54.477
You had sex with him?

45:54.583 --> 45:57.381
This is not a big deal.

45:57.485 --> 46:01.182
What was that rule that you had about
never ever having sex with clients?

46:01.289 --> 46:04.315
<i>Oh, yeah,
"I never ever have sex with my clients. "</i>

46:04.426 --> 46:07.520
Those are my rules.
I can change them if I need to.

46:07.629 --> 46:09.494
It's not like I don't know what I'm doing.

46:09.598 --> 46:10.860
So your parents weren't home?

46:10.966 --> 46:12.695
<i>No, they were downstairs.</i>

46:15.937 --> 46:17.734
- And you were upstairs?
- Yeah.

46:18.039 --> 46:20.166
<i>Look, I am still in control.</i>

46:20.275 --> 46:24.302
This was a one-time
emergency situation.

46:24.412 --> 46:26.039
You know what? Lt's very complicated.

46:26.147 --> 46:29.139
I don't have time right now
to explain to you how business works.

46:29.250 --> 46:32.083
You don't need to explain to me
how business works. I'm not an idiot.

46:32.187 --> 46:33.449
Do you know that I have a contract?

46:33.555 --> 46:38.458
I have fiduciary responsibilities
to uphold.

46:38.560 --> 46:41.358
<i>From a fiduciary standpoint,
would you say that you had an orgasm?</i>

46:43.732 --> 46:45.666
Come on! Were we talking to you?

46:45.767 --> 46:46.893
No. Clean that mess up.

46:47.002 --> 46:49.766
<i>Hey, hey! Hey. Can we please
discuss this someplace else?</i>

46:51.239 --> 46:53.901
<i>That's okay, you guys can stay here
if you want.</i>

46:56.945 --> 46:58.276
What are you gonna do now?

46:58.380 --> 46:59.506
I don't know.

47:00.749 --> 47:03.217
<i>I'm in uncharted waters here, boys.</i>

47:04.219 --> 47:06.915
<i>My mom thinks it's her dog,
but I do all the work.</i>

47:07.022 --> 47:08.455
<i>I mean, you don't brush an Irish setter...</i>

47:08.556 --> 47:10.421
- You have an Irish setter?
- Yeah!

47:10.525 --> 47:11.787
I have a yellow Lab!

47:11.893 --> 47:13.656
<i>I mean, he's getting kind of old,</i>

47:13.762 --> 47:15.525
but we should definitely
get them together.

47:15.630 --> 47:16.995
We should...

47:17.365 --> 47:20.493
<i>God, I'm so lucky. I mean, I'm so lucky.</i>

47:20.602 --> 47:23.594
<i>I mean, look at you, and look at me.</i>

47:23.705 --> 47:25.832
<i>Hey, I mean, come on, look at you.</i>

47:25.940 --> 47:28.670
<i>You're smart, you're attractive,</i>

47:28.777 --> 47:31.245
<i>you love the original Star Wars trilogy,</i>

47:31.346 --> 47:34.782
<i>because it's all about
storytelling, and myth,</i>

47:34.883 --> 47:37.010
before CGI ruined everything.

47:37.118 --> 47:40.053
<i>I mean, come on, what girl
wouldn't want to be with you?</i>

47:40.155 --> 47:41.850
<i>A shocking number, actually.</i>

47:41.956 --> 47:43.321
<i>Well, you know what? Lt's their loss.</i>

47:43.425 --> 47:44.858
<i>You show me a guy who loves Empire</i>

47:44.959 --> 47:48.087
and I will show you a guy
who's not afraid of his imagination.

47:48.329 --> 47:51.662
<i>Like with Luke gets to the cave,
and he asks Yoda what's in there,</i>

47:51.766 --> 47:53.256
and Yoda says...

47:53.668 --> 47:56.660
"Only what you take with you. "

47:57.105 --> 48:01.337
<i>But he goes in anyway, because
he is not afraid of his own mind!</i>

48:01.443 --> 48:03.638
<i>Walking the path of the Jedi, that's why.</i>

48:03.745 --> 48:07.272
That's you! You're Luke!

48:10.485 --> 48:11.611
I gotta pee.

48:12.153 --> 48:13.211
Didn't you just go?

48:13.321 --> 48:15.016
<i>Listen, listen, I'll be right back.</i>

48:15.156 --> 48:16.646
<i>Just don't go anywhere, okay?</i>

48:16.758 --> 48:18.020
I'm not gonna go anywhere.

48:18.126 --> 48:19.218
<i>All right, cool.</i>

48:19.894 --> 48:21.759
<i>But, really, don't go anywhere.</i>

48:35.543 --> 48:36.532
<i>Hiya, Paula.</i>

48:36.644 --> 48:37.668
<i>Oh, God!</i>

48:37.779 --> 48:38.973
Shit!

48:39.681 --> 48:41.945
You scared the crap out of me.

48:43.251 --> 48:46.618
<i>What you doing?
This isn't your usual place, is it?</i>

48:47.322 --> 48:49.984
<i>Just, you know, just...</i>

48:50.425 --> 48:52.222
having lunch with a friend.

48:54.062 --> 48:56.553
You always hold your friends' hands?

48:57.465 --> 48:59.524
<i>Like, then I touched...
We touched hand.</i>

48:59.634 --> 49:01.158
I just touched his hand.

49:01.269 --> 49:03.362
<i>Well, my friends never touch my hands.</i>

49:07.976 --> 49:11.605
You've put me
in a very difficult position here.

49:15.483 --> 49:17.110
<i>Okay, look, what do you want?</i>

49:22.056 --> 49:23.045
No.

49:23.158 --> 49:25.786
It's just coffee.
You don't have to marry him.

49:25.894 --> 49:28.658
<i>First of all,
that's the geeky computer guy.</i>

49:28.763 --> 49:31.732
<i>It's bad enough I have to go out
with a loser who still lives with his mom,</i>

49:31.833 --> 49:35.667
but you led me to believe that it was
the handsome minimum-wage slacker.

49:37.105 --> 49:40.074
<i>No, I don't think that I did that.</i>

49:41.075 --> 49:42.565
<i>Okay, I didn't have a choice.</i>

49:42.677 --> 49:43.735
He was going to tell Tripp

49:43.845 --> 49:46.006
and you were the only
bargaining chip that I had.

49:46.114 --> 49:47.775
You should take that as a compliment.

49:47.882 --> 49:49.076
He's a troll.

49:49.184 --> 49:51.448
He's not a troll. He's... He's...

49:52.420 --> 49:55.912
<i>He's endearing, and quirky.</i>

49:56.424 --> 49:57.857
<i>Oh, for Christ's sake.</i>

49:59.060 --> 50:00.391
I'm coming!

50:06.034 --> 50:07.228
Damn it.

50:15.109 --> 50:16.235
I hope you like fish.

50:17.645 --> 50:19.442
<i>So how does Paula do it, anyway?</i>

50:19.547 --> 50:21.242
Lt seems like it would be hard on her.

50:21.349 --> 50:23.647
Does she ever get it confused
with her real life?

50:23.751 --> 50:26.549
What makes you think
she has a real life?

50:28.857 --> 50:31.018
Lt's just kind of a weird job.

50:31.259 --> 50:33.352
<i>I mean, how does one
get into that field?</i>

50:35.463 --> 50:37.522
<i>A couple of years ago, she fell for a guy</i>

50:37.632 --> 50:39.657
who wouldn't move out
of his parents' house.

50:39.767 --> 50:41.928
<i>I don't know, I guess
because she couldn't fix him,</i>

50:42.036 --> 50:44.334
she has to fix
all the other losers out there.

50:45.740 --> 50:46.832
No offense.

50:47.742 --> 50:48.800
None taken.

50:49.677 --> 50:51.668
<i>Listen, if you want to go, that's okay.</i>

50:51.980 --> 50:54.107
I'm sorry I slammed the door
on your face.

50:54.215 --> 50:56.308
I don't sleep much.

50:58.820 --> 50:59.809
Really?

51:00.455 --> 51:01.581
<i>Me, either.</i>

51:02.357 --> 51:05.190
Just have too much stuff going on
in my head. Is that the same thing?

51:05.293 --> 51:06.453
<i>No, no.</i>

51:07.729 --> 51:10.892
<i>No. No. I want to sleep,</i>

51:10.999 --> 51:13.399
<i>but I can't, because there's a bird
outside my window</i>

51:13.501 --> 51:16.163
<i>and all night long it chirps,
and it chirps, and it chirps,</i>

51:16.271 --> 51:18.796
<i>and it's annoying,
and I can't get it to shut up!</i>

51:23.811 --> 51:25.278
I have a BB gun.

51:33.388 --> 51:35.151
<i>Go, Omaha!</i>

51:37.892 --> 51:38.859
Yeah.

51:39.627 --> 51:41.492
<i>Say, did you get my message today?</i>

51:43.731 --> 51:45.028
<i>No. You know what,
I had my phone turned off.</i>

51:45.133 --> 51:48.000
I was having lunch with a girlfriend.

51:48.503 --> 51:50.869
<i>My teacher, Miss Kramer,
has a girlfriend.</i>

51:51.339 --> 51:52.670
Oh! That's nice.

51:52.774 --> 51:53.866
She's a lesbian.

51:54.742 --> 51:56.607
<i>Well, don't act all cool about it!</i>

51:57.078 --> 51:58.568
You're jealous 'cause you like her.

51:58.680 --> 52:01.046
You're the one
who was always staring at her shirt.

52:02.016 --> 52:03.005
He's lying.

52:12.327 --> 52:13.851
I don't hear anything.

52:15.797 --> 52:16.991
He'll come.

52:18.433 --> 52:19.957
He always comes.

52:21.536 --> 52:23.197
How many times did you pump it?

52:25.707 --> 52:27.470
- Twice.
- Good.

52:27.575 --> 52:31.511
<i>'Cause we don't want to kill it,
just sting it so it flies away.</i>

52:32.981 --> 52:33.948
Yeah.

52:35.750 --> 52:39.686
<i>So, is Kit short for Katherine?</i>

52:40.888 --> 52:44.585
Yes. Is Ace short for

52:45.493 --> 52:46.858
Ace-a-rooney?

52:47.061 --> 52:48.892
<i>No, it's a nickname.</i>

52:48.997 --> 52:51.329
<i>What, are you really good at cards
or something?</i>

52:52.467 --> 52:56.426
<i>Until I was 10,
I had an undescended testicle.</i>

53:03.911 --> 53:04.969
Wait!

53:08.016 --> 53:09.040
There you are.

53:09.984 --> 53:11.611
<i>Say good night, birdie.</i>

53:14.522 --> 53:15.580
I got him!

53:18.359 --> 53:20.589
<i>You pumped it more than twice,
didn't you?</i>

53:22.864 --> 53:25.458
<i>Oh, my God!
God, why'd you make me do that?</i>

53:26.501 --> 53:27.934
<i>- Clear the table!
- Oh, God!</i>

53:28.169 --> 53:29.932
<i>- Oh, my God! Ls he okay?
- I don't know.</i>

53:30.038 --> 53:31.232
- Where's he hit?
- I don't know!

53:31.339 --> 53:33.034
- Is he dead?
- I...

53:33.141 --> 53:34.108
<i>Oh, no!</i>

53:34.609 --> 53:37.703
Look! Look! The BB.

53:38.079 --> 53:40.104
<i>Well, maybe it's just stunned.
Do you know CPR?</i>

53:40.214 --> 53:41.545
<i>- Well, yeah, but...
- Do it!</i>

53:41.916 --> 53:43.042
- It's a bird!
- Do it!

53:43.151 --> 53:46.518
Okay. Check vitals. Where's the pulse?

53:47.155 --> 53:48.713
- Gently.
- Open the airway.

53:48.990 --> 53:50.753
- Don't hurt him!
- I'm not hurting him!

53:50.858 --> 53:51.825
God!

53:52.460 --> 53:53.427
Okay. Be careful with him.

53:53.528 --> 53:54.586
- He's little.
- I don't know.

53:54.695 --> 53:57.289
<i>Oh, my God, it's not working!
He's going!</i>

53:57.398 --> 53:59.195
Do something! We're losing him!

53:59.300 --> 54:00.460
Not on my watch!

54:04.105 --> 54:05.902
<i>One, one thousand, two, one thousand,
three, one thousand.</i>

54:06.007 --> 54:07.634
<i>Walk away from the light, little buddy!</i>

54:09.510 --> 54:11.444
<i>One, one thousand, two, one thousand,
three, one thousand!</i>

54:11.546 --> 54:12.513
<i>Please, God!</i>

54:14.882 --> 54:17.009
<i>Oh, my God. Oh, my God! He's alive!</i>

54:29.363 --> 54:30.387
What the...

54:42.510 --> 54:43.772
I'm hungry.

54:43.878 --> 54:47.814
<i>Captain, you just had nachos,
two hot dogs, and a bag of peanuts.</i>

54:48.182 --> 54:50.116
I didn't have ice cream.

54:50.318 --> 54:51.683
My bad.

54:51.786 --> 54:53.253
Fine. Can I have a fruit bar?

54:53.354 --> 54:54.321
Now you're getting good.

54:54.422 --> 54:56.253
That's good. A negotiator here. All right.

54:56.424 --> 54:57.652
<i>Hey, wait for me.</i>

54:59.026 --> 55:01.085
<i>Let's check with Miss Paula,
see if she needs anything.</i>

55:01.195 --> 55:04.062
Maybe a Royal's Number One
foam finger.

55:04.165 --> 55:05.632
Don't come back without a foam finger.

55:05.733 --> 55:06.927
You got it.

55:14.876 --> 55:16.776
<i>Tripp and Jeffrey are very cute together,
aren't they?</i>

55:16.878 --> 55:19.039
<i>- Yeah. Listen, while we have a minute,
- Yeah?</i>

55:19.147 --> 55:20.580
..I really want to talk to you
about the whole

55:20.681 --> 55:22.581
dating-my-best-friend-for-money thing.

55:23.417 --> 55:24.907
<i>- What?
- So, this must be the date</i>

55:25.019 --> 55:27.419
where you show that you share
the guy's intense passion for something

55:27.522 --> 55:29.456
<i>that, really, you don't have
the slightest interest in.</i>

55:30.224 --> 55:32.283
<i>Okay, look, I don't know
what you heard, but...</i>

55:32.393 --> 55:33.621
Ace told me everything.

55:35.062 --> 55:37.087
<i>Don't worry, I haven't ratted you out.</i>

55:38.399 --> 55:40.799
<i>Truth is, I support your overall goal.</i>

55:42.103 --> 55:45.072
<i>But if you really want to help him,
and I think you do,</i>

55:45.173 --> 55:46.697
you have to have all the facts.

55:46.941 --> 55:49.501
Starting with the fact
that Jeffrey's not Tripp's nephew.

55:51.179 --> 55:52.237
You ever heard of Amy?

55:52.480 --> 55:54.448
Amy is... He's Amy's son.

55:54.615 --> 55:57.846
<i>Amy is Tripp's first love,
and she died six years ago.</i>

55:58.052 --> 55:59.747
<i>He never told you that, did he?</i>

56:02.823 --> 56:04.154
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

56:04.559 --> 56:08.859
I am the worst person in the world.

56:09.564 --> 56:12.624
<i>Oh, hey, you're home. Great.</i>

56:12.833 --> 56:16.701
<i>I have to break up with Tripp.
I'm terminating my contract, and...</i>

56:17.338 --> 56:18.327
I can't do it.

56:19.540 --> 56:20.802
What happened in here?

56:20.908 --> 56:22.341
Nothing. I tripped.

56:23.010 --> 56:24.409
Go on with your story.

56:24.512 --> 56:26.207
<i>Oh. Well,</i>

56:28.316 --> 56:29.943
Tripp was engaged.

56:32.053 --> 56:34.419
<i>- Okay.
- And you know Jeffrey, his nephew?</i>

56:34.755 --> 56:38.020
He's not his nephew.
He's not related to him at all.

56:38.159 --> 56:41.185
<i>Jeffrey is a boy whose mother
was gonna marry Tripp,</i>

56:42.463 --> 56:43.691
and she died.

56:45.499 --> 56:46.966
That's so sad.

56:47.068 --> 56:48.501
<i>God, I know.</i>

56:49.237 --> 56:50.829
Who gives a shit?

56:51.839 --> 56:53.136
I beg your pardon?

56:53.241 --> 56:56.074
Seriously. I've never heard you
talk this way about a client before.

56:56.177 --> 56:57.667
I don't know why you're whining
about this one.

56:57.778 --> 56:58.904
Because...

56:59.714 --> 57:02.239
He's been through an actual tragedy!

57:04.619 --> 57:08.055
This is about Tripp not being
an appropriate client.

57:08.155 --> 57:10.089
It's an ethical problem.

57:12.927 --> 57:14.019
Who's that?

57:16.597 --> 57:17.655
What?

57:18.899 --> 57:19.957
In...

57:21.168 --> 57:22.692
Oh! In...

57:22.803 --> 57:24.031
That's Phillip.

57:24.805 --> 57:26.170
Who's Phillip?

57:27.541 --> 57:28.974
Phillip's...

57:29.143 --> 57:30.371
I... Oh!

57:32.680 --> 57:35.148
<i>Hi, ladies.</i>

57:35.483 --> 57:37.280
Did I say that you could come out?

57:40.254 --> 57:42.415
<i>Well, well, well, well, well.</i>

57:43.457 --> 57:44.754
He's nice.

57:44.859 --> 57:46.224
That's nice.

57:47.495 --> 57:49.793
<i>Look, I don't see
why it's so complicated.</i>

57:49.897 --> 57:52.127
You like Tripp. Tell Tripp you like him.

57:53.901 --> 57:55.198
<i>I gotta tell you something.</i>

57:55.569 --> 57:57.161
I told Paula about Amy.

57:58.272 --> 58:00.502
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What? What...</i>

58:00.608 --> 58:01.666
Why?

58:01.776 --> 58:03.038
You were never going to.

58:03.344 --> 58:04.971
You never even say her name.

58:05.279 --> 58:08.009
Amy was his ex-fiancée.
She died about six years ago.

58:08.115 --> 58:10.913
To lose love is greatest pain of all.

58:11.018 --> 58:12.007
That's right.

58:12.119 --> 58:13.984
It's okay to cry. We'll turn around.

58:14.088 --> 58:15.578
<i>I'm fine, guys.</i>

58:18.025 --> 58:19.083
Dude.

58:20.728 --> 58:23.856
<i>You had no right to do that, man.
That's my life.</i>

58:24.031 --> 58:25.521
<i>You're right, you're right.
And, normally...</i>

58:25.633 --> 58:27.498
<i>I believe everybody
needs to walk their own path,</i>

58:27.601 --> 58:30.297
but just you're not walking yours. Okay?

58:30.404 --> 58:32.429
<i>You're sitting near the path, on a rock.</i>

58:33.441 --> 58:35.966
<i>This was the only thing I could do,
given the circumstances.</i>

58:36.077 --> 58:37.544
Circumstances?

58:38.412 --> 58:40.380
Brings up the other thing I gotta tell you.

58:41.048 --> 58:43.278
I feel a little bit bad
because I kind of implied to Paula

58:43.384 --> 58:44.612
<i>that I wouldn't say anything, but...</i>

58:44.719 --> 58:46.710
Deception's a poison.
It's like margarine.

58:46.821 --> 58:47.879
I can't have that in my body.

58:47.988 --> 58:50.115
<i>God damn it, Demo, get to the point.
Come on.</i>

58:51.425 --> 58:54.861
Your parents hired Paula to date you
so that you'd move out of their house.

58:56.030 --> 58:57.759
Bullshit. What are you talking about?

58:58.065 --> 59:00.056
They're paying her to be your girlfriend.

59:00.167 --> 59:01.429
- Paula?
- Yeah.

59:01.535 --> 59:04.333
But she's a professional interventionist.
It's her job.

59:04.505 --> 59:05.472
You know?

59:07.742 --> 59:10.836
You're telling me it's not real?

59:10.945 --> 59:14.779
<i>No. No, it's real! Lt's very real!</i>

59:14.882 --> 59:16.372
<i>Okay, you're upset right now.</i>

59:16.484 --> 59:19.009
I want to encourage you to see past
that bottomless sense of betrayal.

59:19.120 --> 59:20.815
<i>Focus on the future, okay?</i>

59:20.921 --> 59:22.388
'Cause I think you guys
could work things out.

59:22.490 --> 59:24.958
I mean it.
I think you crazy kids have a shot.

59:32.767 --> 59:35.031
So you came home
and he was cooking?

59:35.136 --> 59:36.228
Yeah.

59:36.637 --> 59:37.831
Strange.

59:38.406 --> 59:40.203
<i>- Hey, you know what?
- What?</i>

59:40.307 --> 59:42.741
- Smells good.
- I know!

59:46.247 --> 59:47.236
Can you get that?

59:52.219 --> 59:54.813
Hi. I didn't know that you guys
were gonna be here.

59:54.922 --> 59:57.390
<i>Listen, we didn't, either. Come on in.</i>

59:57.491 --> 59:58.515
Okay. Thank you.

59:58.626 --> 01:00:00.025
Tripp's in the kitchen.

01:00:02.596 --> 01:00:04.086
<i>That does, too.</i>

01:00:04.765 --> 01:00:05.732
All right!

01:00:09.637 --> 01:00:10.604
Tripp?

01:00:11.172 --> 01:00:13.470
<i>Hey, there's my girl. Come here, you.</i>

01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:16.770
<i>Hey, what's going on?</i>

01:00:16.877 --> 01:00:18.742
Got a little family dinner.

01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:22.281
All the people that I care about the most

01:00:22.383 --> 01:00:24.783
together in one room. Good times.

01:00:24.885 --> 01:00:26.250
Hey.

01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:28.251
<i>Listen, can we talk?</i>

01:00:28.355 --> 01:00:30.414
Absolutely. There's gonna be
plenty of time to talk over dinner.

01:00:30.524 --> 01:00:32.389
<i>But right now, I'm cooking.</i>

01:00:33.127 --> 01:00:35.357
<i>Mom, Pop, you want some more vino?</i>

01:00:37.164 --> 01:00:38.358
<i>That's good, that's good.</i>

01:00:38.466 --> 01:00:40.331
<i>Oh, just a little bit more
for the y-o-u, babe.</i>

01:00:40.734 --> 01:00:42.065
<i>Tripp, I don't know what to say.</i>

01:00:42.169 --> 01:00:44.330
<i>Oh, Mom, will you knock that talk off?</i>

01:00:46.407 --> 01:00:48.637
I made this beautiful dinner tonight

01:00:49.109 --> 01:00:52.408
to say thank you
to the people that I love the most.

01:00:52.513 --> 01:00:54.276
All of you.

01:00:54.448 --> 01:00:55.745
I'm truly blessed.

01:00:55.850 --> 01:00:58.614
Mom. Pop. Sweetie.

01:00:58.986 --> 01:01:01.181
<i>- That's good, Son.
- Cheers.</i>

01:01:03.757 --> 01:01:04.917
Dig in!

01:01:10.264 --> 01:01:12.858
<i>Hang on. Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
I'm too excited.</i>

01:01:12.967 --> 01:01:14.730
I have an announcement to make here.

01:01:15.936 --> 01:01:16.903
Okay.

01:01:22.076 --> 01:01:23.373
<i>Paula,</i>

01:01:23.944 --> 01:01:25.411
the last couple of weeks

01:01:26.981 --> 01:01:29.313
that I've spent with you have been

01:01:30.451 --> 01:01:31.782
<i>amazing,</i>

01:01:32.553 --> 01:01:33.884
<i>surprising,</i>

01:01:34.889 --> 01:01:36.049
<i>joyful,</i>

01:01:37.057 --> 01:01:38.388
surprising.

01:01:39.827 --> 01:01:43.228
<i>I can honestly say that, because of you,</i>

01:01:45.299 --> 01:01:49.326
I've experienced emotions
that I didn't even know I had.

01:01:53.374 --> 01:01:54.966
<i>So call me crazy,</i>

01:01:55.676 --> 01:01:56.700
but I think

01:01:57.077 --> 01:01:58.442
we should move in together.

01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:01.145
That's my boy!

01:02:02.182 --> 01:02:03.706
<i>You okay, baby? Want some water?</i>

01:02:04.919 --> 01:02:05.886
Thank you.

01:02:06.353 --> 01:02:08.184
That's wonderful news.

01:02:08.522 --> 01:02:10.285
<i>I am so proud of you, Son.</i>

01:02:10.391 --> 01:02:12.689
<i>Right? And the thing is, Mom, Dad,</i>

01:02:12.793 --> 01:02:16.524
<i>I've lived upstairs since I was three,
and it's been great.</i>

01:02:17.731 --> 01:02:21.189
All right? You two are the best parents
that a boy could ever ask for.

01:02:21.302 --> 01:02:24.999
<i>I mean, I can only hope that I'm going
to be able to give my kids,</i>

01:02:28.642 --> 01:02:29.870
<i>our kids,</i>

01:02:30.544 --> 01:02:34.173
<i>half of the love, the respect,</i>

01:02:34.381 --> 01:02:36.372
<i>the understanding, the support,</i>

01:02:36.483 --> 01:02:38.348
that you two have given me.

01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:42.321
<i>I guess what I'm saying is,
it is time for Tripp</i>

01:02:43.891 --> 01:02:45.381
to spread his wings.

01:02:50.898 --> 01:02:51.865
Wow.

01:02:53.133 --> 01:02:54.100
Well...

01:02:55.202 --> 01:02:58.069
<i>Well, this is very unexpected.</i>

01:02:58.172 --> 01:02:59.571
<i>So here's the plan, all right?</i>

01:02:59.673 --> 01:03:01.368
<i>We're going to blow out
the east wall of my bedroom,</i>

01:03:01.475 --> 01:03:02.772
<i>enlarge the bathroom,</i>

01:03:02.876 --> 01:03:07.210
and basically turn the entire upstairs
into a secondary master suite

01:03:07.381 --> 01:03:09.372
<i>so there's room for the both of us,</i>

01:03:10.117 --> 01:03:11.141
<i>and the both of you,</i>

01:03:11.251 --> 01:03:12.218
under the same roof.

01:03:12.319 --> 01:03:13.479
What do you say?

01:03:21.462 --> 01:03:24.693
I'm not understanding.
You want Paula to move in here?

01:03:24.798 --> 01:03:26.959
Yes! Lt's the perfect solution.

01:03:27.067 --> 01:03:29.934
<i>Mom, Dad, you like her.
Paula, you like them.</i>

01:03:30.037 --> 01:03:34.064
<i>We're all gonna be right here together
under one roof, a big happy family.</i>

01:03:34.174 --> 01:03:36.142
<i>I'm telling you,
I'm getting really excited about this.</i>

01:03:36.243 --> 01:03:37.437
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait just a second.</i>

01:03:37.578 --> 01:03:39.045
Take a deep breath here and...

01:03:39.146 --> 01:03:41.376
<i>Tripp, Tripp, I just think
that we should probably talk about this.</i>

01:03:41.482 --> 01:03:43.245
<i>Just 'cause it's a big idea, and...</i>

01:03:43.350 --> 01:03:45.614
<i>Honey, I've given this
a lot of thought, all right? Lt'll work!</i>

01:03:46.086 --> 01:03:49.180
<i>And the best part about it is, Mom, Dad,</i>

01:03:51.025 --> 01:03:53.960
you won't have to keep paying Paula
to be my girlfriend.

01:04:00.134 --> 01:04:02.329
<i>What, did I say something wrong?
Come on.</i>

01:04:03.570 --> 01:04:05.197
You're all getting what you wanted.

01:04:05.906 --> 01:04:09.171
<i>Paula, you don't have to pretend
to like me anymore.</i>

01:04:09.343 --> 01:04:12.710
<i>And, Mom, Dad,
you wanted me out of the house.</i>

01:04:16.550 --> 01:04:17.744
I'm out.

01:04:31.632 --> 01:04:34.430
<i>Tripp, wait! Tripp!</i>

01:04:35.569 --> 01:04:36.536
Tripp!

01:04:38.772 --> 01:04:40.205
I don't want to hear it.

01:04:40.674 --> 01:04:42.005
<i>Come on, Tripp.</i>

01:04:43.877 --> 01:04:46.437
<i>Please, you don't understand.</i>

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:48.238
You're right. Now hold on.

01:04:49.650 --> 01:04:51.709
<i>I don't know what your daily rate is,</i>

01:04:51.819 --> 01:04:54.845
but that's everything
I've got in my wallet. There's $300.

01:04:54.955 --> 01:04:56.422
<i>Oh, come on, Tripp!</i>

01:04:56.523 --> 01:04:59.822
<i>Which should be good for tonight,
especially since we didn't have sex.</i>

01:04:59.927 --> 01:05:02.327
<i>Please, Tripp, let me just explain to you.</i>

01:05:02.429 --> 01:05:04.226
Get the fuck out of my car.

01:05:11.905 --> 01:05:13.270
<i>Oh, God.</i>

01:05:54.948 --> 01:05:56.813
So your parents gave her money.

01:05:56.917 --> 01:05:59.010
My grandparents
give my baby-sitter money

01:05:59.119 --> 01:06:00.143
and I still like her.

01:06:00.254 --> 01:06:02.984
<i>Well, good for you, Captain.
Hey, can we talk about something else?</i>

01:06:03.090 --> 01:06:05.581
Fine. The 32 is nice.

01:06:08.362 --> 01:06:10.762
But I think I see myself more in a 37.

01:06:11.298 --> 01:06:12.458
What do you think?

01:06:12.766 --> 01:06:14.199
<i>Don't buy a boat, dude.</i>

01:06:15.302 --> 01:06:17.395
I love... boats.

01:06:17.704 --> 01:06:19.899
<i>No, you don't love boats.</i>

01:06:20.107 --> 01:06:22.905
You love the idea of a boat.

01:06:23.477 --> 01:06:25.138
<i>But the reality is,</i>

01:06:25.279 --> 01:06:28.646
<i>they're just a drain on your time,
your wallet, and your emotions.</i>

01:06:29.216 --> 01:06:31.207
<i>And in the end,
she will break your heart.</i>

01:06:32.152 --> 01:06:34.416
<i>You see, because no matter how much
you care for her,</i>

01:06:34.521 --> 01:06:35.749
<i>she's got no feelings for you.</i>

01:06:35.856 --> 01:06:38.324
<i>I mean, look at her, she's a boat.
She's wood.</i>

01:06:40.093 --> 01:06:42.459
<i>So forget buying a boat.
You want to feel pain?</i>

01:06:43.030 --> 01:06:45.260
You're better off
slamming your hand in a car door.

01:06:46.967 --> 01:06:50.403
<i>You see, that's the stuff that screams,
"I live with my mother. "</i>

01:06:50.804 --> 01:06:52.465
- What?
- I mean it.

01:06:52.573 --> 01:06:54.234
I'm telling you as a friend.

01:06:56.543 --> 01:06:58.670
<i>You bring that weak stuff
to the playground,</i>

01:06:58.779 --> 01:07:00.246
you won't last 10 minutes.

01:07:01.982 --> 01:07:04.644
Thank you very much for giving me
a few minutes of your time.

01:07:05.252 --> 01:07:08.312
<i>- Why don't you sit down?
- No, no, no, thank you.</i>

01:07:08.422 --> 01:07:10.287
<i>No, I just want to give you this.</i>

01:07:13.126 --> 01:07:14.889
- What is it?
- It's your money.

01:07:15.329 --> 01:07:17.559
I'm returning it.
I know it doesn't fix anything.

01:07:17.664 --> 01:07:19.325
<i>I know that nothing can,</i>

01:07:20.467 --> 01:07:23.630
<i>but given the circumstances,
I don't feel good keeping it, so...</i>

01:07:24.738 --> 01:07:25.966
<i>Really, please take it.</i>

01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:27.507
Okay.

01:07:29.610 --> 01:07:30.577
What?

01:07:30.677 --> 01:07:32.736
This has never happened before.
I want you to know that.

01:07:32.846 --> 01:07:35.406
He seemed like an open-and-shut case.

01:07:36.383 --> 01:07:39.113
I guess I was overly confident.

01:07:39.386 --> 01:07:40.819
I don't know. And he...

01:07:41.722 --> 01:07:44.282
<i>He won't return
any of my phone calls, and I...</i>

01:07:45.993 --> 01:07:48.257
I keep replaying it over and over
in my mind. I just...

01:07:48.362 --> 01:07:50.057
I don't know where I...

01:07:52.933 --> 01:07:54.696
You're in love with our son.

01:08:06.446 --> 01:08:08.676
<i>Hey, come on, we're gonna go
rock climbing. Get in the car.</i>

01:08:08.782 --> 01:08:09.749
No.

01:08:10.317 --> 01:08:12.148
You've been moping around here
for two weeks.

01:08:12.252 --> 01:08:13.446
<i>Come on, get in.</i>

01:08:13.954 --> 01:08:14.943
Nah.

01:08:15.055 --> 01:08:17.148
<i>Tripp! Come on, it's unlocked.</i>

01:08:17.256 --> 01:08:19.555
<i>It wants you to get in.
Come on. Get in the car, Tripp.</i>

01:08:20.761 --> 01:08:22.490
<i>Isn't this great, guys?</i>

01:08:22.895 --> 01:08:24.625
<i>How you doing up there, Tripp?</i>

01:08:24.731 --> 01:08:27.029
<i>- You feeling it?
- Yeah, baby.</i>

01:08:27.134 --> 01:08:28.863
This is a nice rock.

01:08:29.403 --> 01:08:31.371
- Aren't you glad we came?
- Yeah.

01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:34.304
Doing good. This is having fun.
Aren't we?

01:08:38.278 --> 01:08:40.269
You guys want any carrots?

01:08:41.113 --> 01:08:43.274
<i>Tripp, you should call Paula.</i>

01:08:44.051 --> 01:08:46.519
<i>- She wants to see you.
- That's enough, Demo!</i>

01:08:48.555 --> 01:08:50.045
<i>A little slack, Ace!</i>

01:08:51.358 --> 01:08:52.484
Here you go.

01:08:55.095 --> 01:08:56.323
Belay on.

01:09:02.469 --> 01:09:04.095
<i>You know, she's hurting, too.</i>

01:09:05.171 --> 01:09:06.469
<i>She's miserable, Tripp.</i>

01:09:09.776 --> 01:09:11.073
<i>Let it go, guys.</i>

01:09:14.081 --> 01:09:15.104
Ace!

01:09:30.130 --> 01:09:31.118
My bad.

01:09:31.298 --> 01:09:34.495
<i>I once knew a specialist used to send
some of his patients to me.</i>

01:09:34.868 --> 01:09:36.392
<i>All they needed was a little push.</i>

01:09:36.937 --> 01:09:39.599
<i>Look, Paula, this has to stop.</i>

01:09:40.006 --> 01:09:40.996
<i>You don't sleep,</i>

01:09:41.108 --> 01:09:43.667
and the only thing I've seen you eat
in the last three days

01:09:43.777 --> 01:09:45.335
is a bag of Mint Milanos.

01:09:45.578 --> 01:09:48.412
<i>Well, don't worry about me.</i>

01:09:49.216 --> 01:09:51.149
I'll be gone in a couple of weeks.

01:09:51.917 --> 01:09:53.350
What? Where are you going?

01:09:53.453 --> 01:09:55.182
I'm moving back to Colorado.

01:09:56.323 --> 01:09:58.348
What are you gonna do in Colorado?

01:09:58.458 --> 01:10:01.359
<i>- I haven't figured it out.
- Well, that's stupid.</i>

01:10:01.461 --> 01:10:03.725
<i>I mean, what are you gonna do
until you figure it out?</i>

01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:05.161
Move in with your parents?

01:10:07.534 --> 01:10:10.799
Oh. That's so wrong.

01:10:10.904 --> 01:10:15.170
<i>Don't judge me, okay?
I mean, you, of all people?</i>

01:10:15.542 --> 01:10:16.839
Pretty funny.

01:10:16.943 --> 01:10:19.411
You know what?
I'm the one who's in a real relationship!

01:10:19.513 --> 01:10:21.413
You're the one who lies for a living!

01:10:21.515 --> 01:10:24.279
<i>You think you're so smart,
but you don't know anything!</i>

01:10:24.384 --> 01:10:26.477
Did you really think
you'd never get caught?

01:10:26.586 --> 01:10:28.144
You could've been happy
but you blew it.

01:10:28.255 --> 01:10:30.280
<i>Now you try to act
like it's everyone else's fault,</i>

01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:31.379
but it's all you.

01:10:31.491 --> 01:10:33.459
And now you think
Colorado's the answer?

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:35.926
<i>You know, Kit,
just because you finally convinced a guy</i>

01:10:36.029 --> 01:10:37.758
to sleep with you more than once

01:10:38.198 --> 01:10:41.065
doesn't make you
an expert on relationships.

01:10:48.575 --> 01:10:50.475
- Tripp!
- Tripp!

01:10:50.977 --> 01:10:52.035
<i>Come on up, buddy.</i>

01:10:52.145 --> 01:10:53.976
- Tripp!
- Tripp?

01:10:55.182 --> 01:10:56.513
<i>Hey! Hey, buddy!</i>

01:10:56.650 --> 01:10:58.618
Come up. There you are.

01:10:59.719 --> 01:11:00.845
- Is he...
- Hey.

01:11:01.955 --> 01:11:03.786
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

01:11:05.926 --> 01:11:07.416
You were bitten by a chuckwalla.

01:11:07.861 --> 01:11:10.022
That shouldn't have happened.
It's a reptile of peace.

01:11:10.163 --> 01:11:11.323
I have a theory.

01:11:11.431 --> 01:11:14.059
This isn't the first time
that nature's lashed out at you like this.

01:11:14.568 --> 01:11:17.036
I believe it's because your life

01:11:17.137 --> 01:11:19.605
is fundamentally at odds
with the natural world.

01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:22.170
<i>- Huh?
- Therefore, nature rejects you.</i>

01:11:24.744 --> 01:11:26.234
You're insane.

01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:27.906
Can I have some water?

01:11:28.014 --> 01:11:29.345
- Yeah.
- Right here.

01:11:29.449 --> 01:11:31.883
<i>- Here we go.
- Okay, okay, easy.</i>

01:11:32.285 --> 01:11:33.809
<i>Look, I've been all over the world.</i>

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:36.184
<i>You're the only human to my knowledge
who's been bitten by a dolphin,</i>

01:11:36.289 --> 01:11:38.757
<i>a chipmunk, and a vegetarian lizard
in the same calendar year.</i>

01:11:40.127 --> 01:11:41.992
<i>And you haven't been
a very good friend, either.</i>

01:11:42.195 --> 01:11:44.220
Do you realize that not once
have you asked me

01:11:44.331 --> 01:11:45.821
about my relationship with Kit?

01:11:49.369 --> 01:11:52.770
<i>Dude, did you just drop me
from a 40-foot cliff?</i>

01:11:54.141 --> 01:11:56.234
<i>I mean, you want
to talk about a friend, man,</i>

01:11:56.343 --> 01:11:57.537
<i>you went behind my back,</i>

01:11:57.644 --> 01:11:59.908
and blackmailed your way
into getting your girlfriend.

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:01.411
He's right.

01:12:02.983 --> 01:12:05.213
- I'm sorry I dropped you from a cliff.
- It's okay.

01:12:05.385 --> 01:12:08.252
<i>Granted, he used you,
but not out of malice.</i>

01:12:08.355 --> 01:12:10.346
Look at him.
How many chances is he gonna get?

01:12:10.457 --> 01:12:12.118
<i>He saw a chance for love, Tripp,
and he took it.</i>

01:12:12.225 --> 01:12:14.216
Which is exactly
what we wanted for you.

01:12:14.928 --> 01:12:16.088
Am I getting advice

01:12:16.196 --> 01:12:18.664
from my two loser buddies
who still live at home?

01:12:18.765 --> 01:12:20.357
<i>Actually, I own my home.</i>

01:12:21.067 --> 01:12:22.591
<i>- What?
- No, you don't.</i>

01:12:22.702 --> 01:12:24.260
I bought it a couple of years ago
from my mom.

01:12:24.371 --> 01:12:25.429
<i>That way, she has a place to live</i>

01:12:25.539 --> 01:12:27.006
and I don't get nailed
on the inheritance tax.

01:12:27.107 --> 01:12:28.233
- Smart.
- Wow.

01:12:28.375 --> 01:12:31.674
<i>And Demo, here, has chosen
the life of a wanderer.</i>

01:12:31.845 --> 01:12:34.006
<i>I mean, sure,
he technically still lives at home.</i>

01:12:34.114 --> 01:12:36.139
- Yeah.
- But his permanent address

01:12:36.249 --> 01:12:37.443
is in his heart.

01:12:38.151 --> 01:12:39.345
He's a bum.

01:12:41.388 --> 01:12:45.324
I think what we're trying to say
is that the two of us are happy

01:12:45.659 --> 01:12:47.126
and we're perfectly functional.

01:12:47.427 --> 01:12:51.090
<i>And you, Tripp, are not.</i>

01:13:05.412 --> 01:13:06.436
Mom?

01:13:08.481 --> 01:13:09.505
Pop?

01:13:25.732 --> 01:13:26.994
<i>Yeah, baby!</i>

01:13:27.667 --> 01:13:28.929
<i>Hey, Pop.</i>

01:13:30.904 --> 01:13:32.701
Hey! Tripp. What are you doing here?

01:13:32.806 --> 01:13:36.139
Just came by to get some stuff.
What are you doing?

01:13:36.610 --> 01:13:37.804
Feeding my fish.

01:13:37.911 --> 01:13:40.311
Yeah. I see that.

01:13:42.749 --> 01:13:45.513
You're naked. In my room.

01:13:46.386 --> 01:13:49.219
<i>Well, this is my Naked Room.</i>

01:13:50.257 --> 01:13:51.622
<i>I mean, it's my house.</i>

01:13:51.891 --> 01:13:55.759
A man ought to be able to do whatever
he wants to do in his own house.

01:13:56.429 --> 01:13:58.158
Wore a suit for 40 years.

01:13:58.598 --> 01:14:00.589
- So now we got 40 years of...
- No suit.

01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:01.928
No suit.

01:14:03.169 --> 01:14:04.431
All right.

01:14:05.171 --> 01:14:06.695
I'm gonna let you get back
to feeding your fish.

01:14:06.806 --> 01:14:08.706
Thanks for stopping by.

01:14:10.477 --> 01:14:14.675
<i>Hey, Pop? Seriously, man,
was it that bad having me around?</i>

01:14:16.783 --> 01:14:19.843
<i>Don't be an idiot, Son.
Your mom and I love you.</i>

01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:21.953
Then why didn't you
just say something?

01:14:22.055 --> 01:14:24.956
All you had to do was tell me.

01:14:25.558 --> 01:14:28.493
<i>You needed time
after Amy had passed away, Tripp.</i>

01:14:28.595 --> 01:14:31.155
And who knows how much time is right?

01:14:31.564 --> 01:14:33.930
Ls it two years? Ls it six years?

01:14:34.034 --> 01:14:37.265
<i>Then I ran into Bud and Bev Nestor,
and they'd worked with Paula.</i>

01:14:37.504 --> 01:14:40.268
And their son is really happy now.

01:14:40.373 --> 01:14:44.571
<i>Lives in Seattle, I think.
Married an Indian girl.</i>

01:14:45.178 --> 01:14:48.841
<i>Anyway, it just seemed easier.</i>

01:14:48.982 --> 01:14:50.142
Easier.

01:14:53.353 --> 01:14:54.445
All right.

01:14:56.389 --> 01:14:57.651
<i>Hey, man,</i>

01:14:59.326 --> 01:15:01.351
<i>I gotta say, I like
what you've done with the place.</i>

01:15:01.461 --> 01:15:04.362
<i>Yeah, I like it. I love you, Son.</i>

01:15:04.464 --> 01:15:06.193
<i>I love you, too. Shake on it.</i>

01:15:07.233 --> 01:15:09.531
<i>Why don't you get back
to scaring those fish, buddy? Huh?</i>

01:15:09.636 --> 01:15:10.603
All right.

01:15:11.137 --> 01:15:12.764
<i>Come back anytime, Son.</i>

01:15:12.872 --> 01:15:14.499
Come here. Bucket. Bucket.

01:15:19.979 --> 01:15:21.844
<i>- Hey, Mom.
- Tripp.</i>

01:15:22.282 --> 01:15:23.806
You see what's going on upstairs?

01:15:24.017 --> 01:15:26.212
<i>Pop's naked, in his Naked Room.</i>

01:15:26.319 --> 01:15:28.184
I know. He's always wanted one.

01:15:28.288 --> 01:15:29.846
He tried to take over the dining room

01:15:29.956 --> 01:15:32.857
until I convinced him
that the first floor was problematic.

01:15:35.295 --> 01:15:36.853
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:15:37.297 --> 01:15:38.764
Just came by to pick up some clothes.

01:15:42.802 --> 01:15:44.099
I'm sorry.

01:15:46.406 --> 01:15:47.998
It was a lousy thing to do.

01:15:51.578 --> 01:15:53.546
<i>You know, when we first met Paula,</i>

01:15:55.081 --> 01:15:56.639
<i>when we hired her, I...</i>

01:15:57.250 --> 01:15:58.877
I didn't want you to go.

01:15:59.886 --> 01:16:02.411
<i>For years, I've been dreading
the day you'd leave</i>

01:16:02.522 --> 01:16:06.014
and I always thought
it was 'cause I'd miss you so much.

01:16:06.259 --> 01:16:09.228
Then I realized that
that was only part of it.

01:16:09.396 --> 01:16:11.489
I didn't want you to leave because

01:16:12.465 --> 01:16:15.400
being alone with your father
freaks the living shit out of me.

01:16:15.869 --> 01:16:17.769
<i>- What?
- I'm terrified, Tripp!</i>

01:16:17.937 --> 01:16:19.996
And it's not just about the Naked Room.

01:16:20.407 --> 01:16:23.467
<i>Since your father retired, I just...</i>

01:16:24.444 --> 01:16:26.139
I'm used to having you here.

01:16:27.013 --> 01:16:29.243
<i>Like a buffer, you know?
Somebody to talk to</i>

01:16:29.349 --> 01:16:31.817
<i>when your father's all
moody and sullen, and...</i>

01:16:33.253 --> 01:16:34.311
Now I'm...

01:16:34.454 --> 01:16:37.287
We're just gonna have to
get to know each other all over again.

01:16:38.324 --> 01:16:39.450
And...

01:16:43.797 --> 01:16:44.855
What?

01:16:48.668 --> 01:16:50.192
What if he doesn't like me?

01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:55.007
Hey.

01:17:03.416 --> 01:17:04.940
<i>You still love him, right?</i>

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:08.712
Against all odds.

01:17:10.457 --> 01:17:12.049
Then you'll figure it out.

01:17:16.696 --> 01:17:17.663
Come here.

01:17:18.765 --> 01:17:20.392
Hey.

01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:29.164
You're gonna miss me.

01:17:30.543 --> 01:17:31.532
That's true.

01:17:31.978 --> 01:17:36.278
I called you all here together
because obviously we have a situation.

01:17:36.382 --> 01:17:40.250
<i>I know we all feel some responsibility,
but this isn't about blame,</i>

01:17:40.353 --> 01:17:42.548
it's about finding a solution.

01:17:42.889 --> 01:17:44.982
Two people we love are hurting.

01:17:45.091 --> 01:17:47.889
So let's put on our thinking caps.

01:17:48.027 --> 01:17:51.019
<i>Man, this shirt feels
like it weighs 100 pounds.</i>

01:17:51.130 --> 01:17:52.290
Albert!

01:17:54.634 --> 01:17:56.158
<i>Okay, how about this?</i>

01:17:56.769 --> 01:18:01.035
<i>We send flowers to Paula from Tripp,</i>

01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:05.668
and flowers to Tripp from Paula.

01:18:07.714 --> 01:18:11.172
- Then what?
- Then they love each other.

01:18:11.284 --> 01:18:12.683
<i>Oh, Jesus Christ!</i>

01:18:12.785 --> 01:18:14.252
Because of the flowers!

01:18:14.988 --> 01:18:16.285
<i>Thank you, Phillip.</i>

01:18:16.389 --> 01:18:20.689
<i>Now, let's all try to come up with a plan
that's not so idiotic.</i>

01:18:24.631 --> 01:18:25.598
Hey.

01:18:27.667 --> 01:18:28.827
<i>Listen,</i>

01:18:31.137 --> 01:18:35.506
<i>I went through all the CDs,
but if you end up with some of mine</i>

01:18:35.608 --> 01:18:37.576
<i>or I end up with some of yours,</i>

01:18:37.677 --> 01:18:39.508
<i>let's just call it even, okay?</i>

01:18:40.079 --> 01:18:41.410
<i>Okay, sure.</i>

01:18:42.015 --> 01:18:42.982
Okay.

01:18:45.084 --> 01:18:46.210
I hate this.

01:18:46.319 --> 01:18:47.616
<i>I know. I do, too.</i>

01:18:47.887 --> 01:18:48.854
So...

01:18:50.490 --> 01:18:54.654
<i>So let's just get it over with, then.</i>

01:18:58.765 --> 01:19:00.665
<i>Okay, look, I know I'm a girl</i>

01:19:00.767 --> 01:19:02.758
and I'm supposed to be better
at this emotional crap

01:19:02.869 --> 01:19:04.928
<i>but I'm not, so I'm just gonna say it.</i>

01:19:05.038 --> 01:19:09.338
I'm sorry that I pointed out to you
that you fell in love with a client

01:19:09.442 --> 01:19:11.876
and that made you go crazy
and turn into a total bitch.

01:19:15.381 --> 01:19:16.348
Wow.

01:19:18.251 --> 01:19:21.015
That must've been really hard
for you to say.

01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:25.079
<i>I thought it was going to be, but I just
kind of breezed right through it.</i>

01:19:27.327 --> 01:19:28.760
<i>Well, thanks.</i>

01:19:29.796 --> 01:19:33.254
And I'm sorry that I pointed out

01:19:33.366 --> 01:19:35.630
that you haven't had a real relationship
for the last five years

01:19:35.735 --> 01:19:37.600
because I'm the only person
who can tolerate

01:19:37.704 --> 01:19:39.604
your bizarre and violent mood swings.

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:42.871
<i>Oh, thank you!</i>

01:19:46.446 --> 01:19:47.435
Goodbye.

01:19:47.547 --> 01:19:48.775
I'm gonna miss you.

01:19:48.881 --> 01:19:50.246
<i>Yeah, I'm going to miss you, too.</i>

01:19:50.850 --> 01:19:53.011
Can I at least give you
a ride to the airport?

01:19:53.119 --> 01:19:54.143
Sure.

01:19:54.287 --> 01:19:56.084
<i>On the way, let's stop at Phillip's,</i>

01:19:56.189 --> 01:19:59.022
<i>so I can give you back
that sweater of yours that you lost.</i>

01:20:08.201 --> 01:20:10.499
Wow! This is fantastic!

01:20:10.603 --> 01:20:12.434
<i>- Yeah, it's pretty great.
- Wow.</i>

01:20:12.538 --> 01:20:14.733
<i>At this point, we're just waiting
for his mom to kick it</i>

01:20:14.841 --> 01:20:16.433
so we can move upstairs.

01:20:16.643 --> 01:20:18.201
That is a lovely sentiment.

01:20:18.311 --> 01:20:19.437
<i>Go, go, go, go!</i>

01:20:20.246 --> 01:20:21.213
Hey!

01:20:21.614 --> 01:20:23.605
Kit! What are you...

01:20:24.851 --> 01:20:26.284
<i>Oh, hi, fellas.</i>

01:20:27.487 --> 01:20:28.647
<i>- Look in the closet.
- Hey, just look</i>

01:20:28.755 --> 01:20:29.813
- Yeah.
.. right in the closet.

01:20:29.922 --> 01:20:30.946
Why?

01:20:31.057 --> 01:20:32.217
<i>- Huh?
- Go, go, go, go, go!</i>

01:20:32.325 --> 01:20:34.520
Wait! What are you guys doing?

01:20:57.216 --> 01:21:00.117
Sorry. I tried to do it fast
so it wouldn't hurt.

01:21:00.219 --> 01:21:02.119
You were concerned about hurting me?

01:21:02.922 --> 01:21:04.480
That's a refreshing change of pace.

01:21:04.657 --> 01:21:07.182
<i>Listen, I say there's no downside.
They already hate each other.</i>

01:21:07.293 --> 01:21:08.282
I wonder how they're doing.

01:21:08.394 --> 01:21:09.691
<i>Whoa, whoa, hold on just a second.</i>

01:21:09.796 --> 01:21:11.627
<i>Let's check, shall we?</i>

01:21:14.534 --> 01:21:16.331
<i>Okay, watch this.</i>

01:21:19.872 --> 01:21:24.036
<i>Is this how it's gonna be?
'Cause your note says,</i>

01:21:24.143 --> 01:21:26.202
<i>"Hi, we need to talk. "</i>

01:21:26.312 --> 01:21:27.802
<i>Yeah, I wrote that.</i>

01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:32.007
Right after I tied myself to the chair
and covered my mouth with duct tape.

01:21:32.118 --> 01:21:34.382
- So you don't want to talk.
- To you?

01:21:36.055 --> 01:21:37.352
I'll pass.

01:21:40.727 --> 01:21:42.854
I can't see her face.
Do you have any other angles?

01:21:42.962 --> 01:21:44.554
Of course I have angles. Check it out.

01:21:45.364 --> 01:21:49.801
I installed 27 cameras that cover
every inch of the apartment.

01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:52.404
- Were these up last night?
- Yeah.

01:21:52.872 --> 01:21:53.839
No.

01:21:55.241 --> 01:21:56.606
I helped tie the knots.

01:21:56.709 --> 01:21:58.540
The one on his feet
is called an Anchor Hitch.

01:21:58.644 --> 01:22:00.111
I could get out of those ropes.

01:22:00.213 --> 01:22:01.680
You can't get out
of your barbecue apron.

01:22:04.517 --> 01:22:07.111
<i>This is ridiculous,
not to mention juvenile.</i>

01:22:07.220 --> 01:22:10.087
We can't just sit here
and not say anything.

01:22:12.492 --> 01:22:14.585
<i>All right, fine. I'll start.</i>

01:22:15.795 --> 01:22:17.888
I think you're being a jackass.

01:22:21.234 --> 01:22:25.170
<i>I think those pants make you look fat,
but in a sexy...</i>

01:22:26.706 --> 01:22:28.833
- I don't get it.
- I told you this was a stupid idea.

01:22:29.408 --> 01:22:30.375
Hey.

01:22:31.544 --> 01:22:32.806
We should have done the flowers.

01:22:32.912 --> 01:22:35.938
<i>Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
She's going to say something.</i>

01:22:37.884 --> 01:22:39.442
<i>Tripp, I apologize.</i>

01:22:40.253 --> 01:22:43.711
My job was manipulative and deceitful.

01:22:43.823 --> 01:22:47.782
<i>But the second that I found out
about Amy, I was gonna end it.</i>

01:22:48.795 --> 01:22:51.787
<i>But I never got the chance,
because you found out first.</i>

01:23:01.908 --> 01:23:03.259
Sorry. Sorry.

01:23:03.294 --> 01:23:04.610
Sorry. Sorry.

01:23:10.049 --> 01:23:11.448
Apology accepted.

01:23:11.851 --> 01:23:12.943
Thank you.

01:23:14.687 --> 01:23:17.588
Come on.
You don't want to say anything?

01:23:17.690 --> 01:23:20.284
<i>- You know, I do have a question.
- Absolutely. Anything.</i>

01:23:21.194 --> 01:23:23.685
How many others were there?
Before me.

01:23:24.030 --> 01:23:26.794
<i>I'm just asking, 'cause, you know,
maybe we could all get together.</i>

01:23:26.899 --> 01:23:28.389
<i>You know, form a support group.</i>

01:23:28.501 --> 01:23:30.833
<i>And if there already is a group,
I'm curious,</i>

01:23:30.937 --> 01:23:33.030
<i>is it a small group,
like a basketball team?</i>

01:23:33.139 --> 01:23:34.731
<i>Or is it a big group,</i>

01:23:35.741 --> 01:23:36.969
like the Chinese?

01:23:37.610 --> 01:23:39.168
Wow. Somebody's a little cranky today.

01:23:39.278 --> 01:23:43.078
<i>Tripp, your mother was still making you
pancakes for breakfast.</i>

01:23:43.182 --> 01:23:45.878
And it's not as if
I waltzed into your life unbidden.

01:23:45.985 --> 01:23:47.850
Your parents called me.

01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:51.089
Your life was in
an extended stall pattern.

01:23:51.190 --> 01:23:52.782
I wish I could talk to guys like that.

01:23:52.892 --> 01:23:54.883
<i>Well, it's easier when the guy is tied up.</i>

01:23:54.994 --> 01:23:58.225
<i>No, I've talked to guys tied up before.</i>

01:24:00.833 --> 01:24:02.858
You want to talk about my life?
What about your life?

01:24:03.002 --> 01:24:04.333
<i>Hey, but maybe I shouldn't judge.</i>

01:24:04.437 --> 01:24:07.304
<i>I'm sure there's some reason
that you turned out to be a soul-sucking,</i>

01:24:07.406 --> 01:24:09.601
Labrador-retriever-killing harpy.

01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:11.802
I don't get it.
How does the dog fit into it?

01:24:11.911 --> 01:24:13.310
- Good question.
- Can you turn it up?

01:24:13.646 --> 01:24:16.615
<i>Well, they're laptop speakers, so...</i>

01:24:19.051 --> 01:24:20.279
Unless...

01:24:21.988 --> 01:24:23.785
I was doing fine before you showed up.

01:24:24.390 --> 01:24:25.618
All right? I was having fun.

01:24:25.725 --> 01:24:27.352
<i>Oh, and I just ruined everything!</i>

01:24:27.827 --> 01:24:29.920
So is that why you tried
to break up with me?

01:24:30.029 --> 01:24:32.725
<i>Or actually, you didn't.
You just trotted out your parents</i>

01:24:32.832 --> 01:24:35.130
so that I would have
to break up with you.

01:24:35.234 --> 01:24:37.862
<i>- Oh, snap!
- That got his attention!</i>

01:24:37.970 --> 01:24:41.303
<i>That's right, you call her on her shit,
she's gonna call you on yours!</i>

01:24:41.407 --> 01:24:44.570
<i>What are you going to do, baby?
Are you gonna cry?</i>

01:24:45.511 --> 01:24:46.535
Sorry.

01:24:47.413 --> 01:24:49.404
Why would you do that?

01:24:51.217 --> 01:24:52.411
Because

01:24:53.619 --> 01:24:55.109
you gave me "the look. "

01:24:55.221 --> 01:24:57.246
- Not "the look. "
- Why are you bringing up "the look"?

01:24:57.356 --> 01:24:58.345
What's "the look"?

01:24:58.658 --> 01:25:03.220
<i>The look that says, "Hey, I like you. "</i>

01:25:03.729 --> 01:25:05.060
<i>Oh, wow.</i>

01:25:06.999 --> 01:25:09.229
That must've been horrible for you.

01:25:09.502 --> 01:25:10.594
Do I do "the look"?

01:25:10.703 --> 01:25:11.692
<i>Well, yeah.</i>

01:25:11.904 --> 01:25:12.871
<i>Well, no.</i>

01:25:13.539 --> 01:25:15.234
I never meant to hurt you.

01:25:18.978 --> 01:25:22.277
I believe that.
But what do I know about you?

01:25:22.548 --> 01:25:26.951
<i>I mean, the entire amount of time
we spent together was just a big scam.</i>

01:25:28.220 --> 01:25:32.919
<i>I found a woman I cared about,
and she turned out to be a total fraud.</i>

01:25:36.329 --> 01:25:38.126
Do you have real feelings?

01:25:38.831 --> 01:25:40.958
Of course I have real feelings.

01:25:41.067 --> 01:25:43.501
- For what?
- For you!

01:25:44.303 --> 01:25:46.328
<i>And believe me, I did not want that,</i>

01:25:46.439 --> 01:25:49.135
because I had a good life before you.

01:25:49.775 --> 01:25:52.835
<i>Well, not good, but it was okay.</i>

01:25:54.146 --> 01:25:56.444
<i>Well, it was empty, actually,</i>

01:25:56.549 --> 01:26:00.417
but at least I was blissfully unaware
of how miserable I was!

01:26:00.519 --> 01:26:03.317
<i>Whereas now, because of you,</i>

01:26:03.823 --> 01:26:05.950
I am acutely aware

01:26:06.058 --> 01:26:09.323
of how completely
and totally unhappy I am!

01:26:12.732 --> 01:26:14.063
Thank you for that.

01:26:22.408 --> 01:26:26.003
<i>I don't usually like reality TV shows,
but this is so emotional.</i>

01:26:26.645 --> 01:26:28.272
Are you crying?

01:26:30.516 --> 01:26:31.505
<i>Come on, Tripp.</i>

01:26:51.604 --> 01:26:52.662
He's moving.

01:26:52.772 --> 01:26:54.364
He's rolling. Here we go.

01:26:54.473 --> 01:26:55.997
He's making a move! All right!

01:26:56.108 --> 01:26:57.871
He's moving his feet! He's rolling!

01:26:57.977 --> 01:26:59.501
- Go! Go!
- Go!

01:26:59.612 --> 01:27:01.204
<i>Oh, my God! He could</i>

01:27:01.347 --> 01:27:02.871
- go all the way!
- Go all the way!

01:27:02.982 --> 01:27:06.474
<i>Don't do all the work, Son!
Make her meet you half way!</i>

01:27:13.492 --> 01:27:15.050
So what do we do now?

01:27:20.533 --> 01:27:22.831
<i>Actually, it's quite simple.</i>

01:27:22.935 --> 01:27:25.426
You just have to decide.

01:27:26.172 --> 01:27:28.766
Do you want to spend
the rest of your life having fun?

01:27:28.874 --> 01:27:30.899
Or do you want to spend it with me?

01:27:32.044 --> 01:27:35.104
Shut up.
Not everything you say is perfect.

01:27:35.214 --> 01:27:38.012
<i>We can have a little bit of fun, can't we?</i>

01:27:47.126 --> 01:27:48.093
<i>Right on, man!</i>

01:27:48.961 --> 01:27:49.928
All right!

01:27:50.930 --> 01:27:51.897
Yeah!

01:28:00.606 --> 01:28:01.664
Hallelujah!

01:28:05.344 --> 01:28:07.141
Show's over. You don't need to see that.

01:28:07.246 --> 01:28:09.373
<i>Come on, let's you and I
go outside, huh?</i>

01:28:09.482 --> 01:28:11.541
Play some football.
I'll show you how to throw it deep.

01:28:11.650 --> 01:28:13.982
<i>After, I'll show you
how to ice your shoulder down.</i>

01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:26.161
Give you a hand?

01:28:26.265 --> 01:28:29.200
You just take it easy.
I got everything under control.

01:28:29.335 --> 01:28:31.667
<i>Hey, what's the champagne about?</i>

01:28:31.804 --> 01:28:33.066
Lt's Thursday.

01:28:38.410 --> 01:28:39.468
Thank you.

01:28:41.147 --> 01:28:42.341
You're welcome.

01:28:42.915 --> 01:28:43.904
Cheers.

01:28:50.156 --> 01:28:53.125
<i>All right, Captain,
where are we heading?</i>

01:28:56.695 --> 01:28:58.560
There's a lighthouse!
Can we go over there?

01:28:59.031 --> 01:29:00.965
Sure. You're driving.

01:29:07.773 --> 01:29:10.071
<i>Tripp! Jibe ho! God, I said it late!</i>

01:29:10.176 --> 01:29:11.302
I'm sorry!

01:29:16.582 --> 01:29:18.573
- Tripp!
- What happened to "jibe ho"?

01:29:18.684 --> 01:29:20.481
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

01:29:20.586 --> 01:29:23.419
Yeah. Just got the wind
knocked out of me.

01:29:23.522 --> 01:29:25.456
<i>Maybe a collapsed lung,
a bruised sternum.</i>

01:29:25.558 --> 01:29:27.389
<i>Other than that, I'll survive.</i>

01:29:27.493 --> 01:29:30.189
<i>I'm going to get you
a flotation device, okay?</i>

01:29:30.296 --> 01:29:31.263
Yeah.

01:29:32.498 --> 01:29:33.726
Stay right there.

01:29:34.099 --> 01:29:35.794
That's a good idea.

01:29:38.137 --> 01:29:39.297
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

01:29:40.973 --> 01:29:42.304
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

01:29:42.608 --> 01:29:46.169
<i>No biting! No biting. No bite, no bite.
No, no, no, no...</i>

01:29:54.119 --> 01:29:55.086
Good boy.

01:29:55.588 --> 01:29:56.646
<i>Come here, you.</i>

01:29:57.156 --> 01:29:59.147
Yeah. Yeah.

01:29:59.758 --> 01:30:01.316
That's it. Okay.

01:30:01.427 --> 01:30:03.054
Here! I...

01:30:03.929 --> 01:30:05.556
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

01:30:05.664 --> 01:30:06.631
Yeah.

01:30:07.466 --> 01:30:08.956
That's amazing.

01:30:11.103 --> 01:30:13.401
<i>What do you say, big man, huh?</i>

01:30:21.780 --> 01:30:25.181
<i>Hey, still need this?</i>

01:30:28.254 --> 01:30:29.687
<i>No, I'm good.</i>

01:30:32.791 --> 01:30:33.883
I'm real good.

01:30:34.727 --> 01:30:35.694
Okay.

01:30:58.884 --> 01:31:00.875
<i>Honey, it's an Eastern Wood-Pewee.</i>

01:31:00.986 --> 01:31:01.975
Eastern Wood-Pewee?

01:31:02.087 --> 01:31:04.214
You couldn't be more wrong
if you called it a Canadian goose.

01:31:08.394 --> 01:31:10.191
I'll give you a Canadian goose.

01:31:25.010 --> 01:31:26.068
Look!

01:31:30.182 --> 01:31:31.672
He's so tame.

01:31:31.784 --> 01:31:34.685
<i>Yeah. See, once we accept the fact
that we're not separate from nature,</i>

01:31:34.787 --> 01:31:36.448
she welcomes us. And it's not with fear.

01:31:36.555 --> 01:31:38.250
Right? Who do you love?

01:31:43.028 --> 01:31:44.620
<i>Hit the road, Tripp</i>

01:31:44.730 --> 01:31:46.163
<i>- And don't you come back
- And don't you come back</i>

01:31:46.265 --> 01:31:49.428
<i>- ... no more, no more, no more, no more
- ... no more, no more, no more, no more</i>

01:31:49.535 --> 01:31:51.093
<i>- Hit the road, Tripp
- Hit the road, Tripp</i>

01:31:51.203 --> 01:31:54.366
<i>- And don't you come back no more
- And don't you come back no more</i>

01:31:54.473 --> 01:31:55.667
<i>What'd I say?</i>
