00:37.905 --> 00:39.273
Hey, honey.

00:39.273 --> 00:42.310
Hey, Dad.
What are you doing up?

00:42.310 --> 00:43.844
Just a midnight snack.

00:43.844 --> 00:45.113
Okay.

00:45.113 --> 00:46.580
You want anything?

00:46.580 --> 00:47.648
No, I'm good.

00:52.486 --> 00:53.554
Listen, David.

00:56.557 --> 00:59.260
If you ever
want to talk...

00:59.260 --> 01:00.828
about anything...

01:02.630 --> 01:03.997
I'm here.

01:03.997 --> 01:05.399
I know.

01:22.283 --> 01:24.752
**

01:35.563 --> 01:37.331
I don't know.
Maybe she's right.

01:37.331 --> 01:39.467
Maybe my work doesn't
have a point of view.

01:39.467 --> 01:41.235
Look,
if it's any consolation,

01:41.235 --> 01:43.904
Ada Levin
once described my films

01:43.904 --> 01:46.907
as an assault on Eros.

01:46.907 --> 01:48.642
What does that even mean?

01:48.642 --> 01:50.244
I don't know.

01:55.483 --> 01:58.519
Even so, she got me thinking.

02:00.388 --> 02:02.323
I mean, I have to be
honest with myself,

02:02.323 --> 02:04.392
if I'm wasting my time.

02:04.392 --> 02:07.295
Or it shouldn't be like
exploring other mediums.

02:07.295 --> 02:08.796
Hold that thought.

02:22.210 --> 02:23.711
Here.

02:24.812 --> 02:25.879
What's this?

02:25.879 --> 02:27.881
Cute guy's phone number.

02:27.881 --> 02:30.518
He asked me to give it to you.

02:38.626 --> 02:40.761
What am I supposed
to do with this?

02:40.761 --> 02:41.829
Call him.

02:41.829 --> 02:42.930
I can't.

02:42.930 --> 02:45.333
What's stopping you?

02:45.333 --> 02:47.801
Nothing. I'm just not...

02:49.470 --> 02:51.239
in the right head space.

02:51.239 --> 02:53.807
Have you spoken
to David yet?

02:55.443 --> 02:56.477
No.

02:57.578 --> 02:59.046
So is it...

02:59.046 --> 03:02.250
over over between you?

03:02.250 --> 03:04.852
I think so.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.153
Maybe. I don't know.

03:06.153 --> 03:07.788
Been there.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.158
That's it.

03:11.158 --> 03:14.262
As soon as shift's over.
I'm taking you out

03:14.262 --> 03:15.963
and getting you drunk.

03:17.164 --> 03:19.267
I thought you had
plans with Paolo.

03:19.267 --> 03:21.402
This is more important.

03:24.071 --> 03:26.139
What about Mrs. Goldstein?

03:26.139 --> 03:28.276
What about her?

03:28.276 --> 03:29.377
Her husband's
a lot older.

03:29.377 --> 03:30.644
Smokes
like a chimney.

03:30.644 --> 03:32.012
He can't have
many years left.

03:32.012 --> 03:33.281
You're not helping, David.

03:33.281 --> 03:34.915
Look, it's no use, boychik.

03:34.915 --> 03:37.718
I'll never find another
to replace my Rebecca.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.353
She was without equal
among women,

03:39.353 --> 03:40.621
a veritable angel,

03:40.621 --> 03:42.790
or whatever the Jewish
equivalent of that is.

03:42.790 --> 03:45.693
And now she's chosen
a life of celibacy

03:45.693 --> 03:48.296
and quiet contemplation
with her rabbi.

03:48.296 --> 03:49.863
Rabbis aren't celibate.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.365
They're not?

03:51.365 --> 03:53.301
That's priests.

03:54.335 --> 03:56.637
Hey, Nash, you RSVP
for my wedding yet?

03:56.637 --> 04:00.608
Uh, yes, I did,
but as it turns out,

04:00.608 --> 04:02.310
I won't be
bringing a guest.

04:02.310 --> 04:04.912
Makes it easier to hit
on the bridesmaids that way.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.880
Yeah.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.316
Hey, Karen talk to you

04:08.316 --> 04:10.318
about videoing these
upcoming nuptials?

04:10.318 --> 04:12.320
Yeah. I'll do it.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.621
Excellent.

04:13.621 --> 04:15.323
We'll talk about your
shot list later.

04:15.323 --> 04:17.090
Right now we should
talk about Friday.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.326
What's Friday?

04:18.326 --> 04:20.060
Atlantic City.
A little getaway.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.662
Just me
and my best man.

04:21.662 --> 04:23.997
- And you.
- What?

04:23.997 --> 04:26.334
I'm not down with the whole
bachelor party thing

04:26.334 --> 04:28.336
of strippers and paintball.

04:28.336 --> 04:30.471
I'm not gonna pay to see
some girl's Milk Duds.

04:30.471 --> 04:32.506
If I want to see some,
I'll pay Karen.

04:32.506 --> 04:35.376
We're going to party
like adults.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.611
Drink some vino,
see some magic.

04:37.611 --> 04:40.648
I got tickets
to see Copperfield
at the Trump. Whoo.

04:40.648 --> 04:42.416
Why do I need to be there?

04:42.416 --> 04:44.151
Because
you're videographer.

04:44.151 --> 04:45.753
Gig starts then.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.721
Plus, we need
a designated driver.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.457
- Mm, I don't know, Barry.
- Oh, excuse me.

04:49.457 --> 04:52.092
Did I or did I not
do you a major solid

04:52.092 --> 04:54.528
by setting you up
with my buddy Travis
over at WZVX?

04:54.528 --> 04:57.931
- Yeah, you did, but--
- So you owe me, kemo sabe.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.166
I owe you?

04:59.166 --> 05:00.801
Big time.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.738
Fine. What time?

05:04.738 --> 05:08.409
Should roll out
no later than 7:00.

05:09.743 --> 05:10.711
Okay.

05:12.413 --> 05:13.881
I don't know, dude.

05:13.881 --> 05:15.583
Misty and I were going
to hang out Friday, and--

05:15.583 --> 05:16.950
Please, Wheeler. Look,

05:16.950 --> 05:19.119
I promised Barry I'd be
his designated driver,

05:19.119 --> 05:20.654
and you know there's no way

05:20.654 --> 05:22.656
my car will make this trip
to Atlantic City.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.292
Come on, man. Don't make me
do this on my own.

05:25.292 --> 05:27.495
Okay. Screw it.
Let's do it.

05:27.495 --> 05:28.696
Thanks, man.

05:28.696 --> 05:30.163
I could use
a night off anyway.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.533
You and Misty have been
making up for lost time, huh?

05:32.533 --> 05:35.436
Enjoy it while it lasts,
my young friends,

05:35.436 --> 05:38.406
because one day
love will fade,

05:38.406 --> 05:41.909
like memories
and tan lines.

05:41.909 --> 05:44.612
Hey, Nash, you love A.C.
Why don't you come along?

05:44.612 --> 05:46.213
Yeah, man. I mean,
there's plenty of room

05:46.213 --> 05:47.448
in the station wagon.

05:50.217 --> 05:51.619
No, thank you.

05:54.655 --> 05:55.856
I'll work on him.

06:05.433 --> 06:07.100
Come here, Grace.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.570
Come on, sweetheart. Here.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.004
Here you go, Gracie.

06:11.004 --> 06:13.006
Come on. You want
to lick the can?

06:14.074 --> 06:15.443
Here, puss puss.

06:16.577 --> 06:17.911
Where are you?

06:18.912 --> 06:21.281
Come on, Gracie,
where are you?

06:21.281 --> 06:22.716
Come here, honey.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.485
Come on.

06:24.485 --> 06:26.620
Gracie.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.456
Come on.

06:35.162 --> 06:37.164
- Am I the first one here?
- Thanks for coming.

06:37.164 --> 06:38.599
I don't think I could
have done this on my own.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.734
No sweat.
You hear from Skye?

06:40.734 --> 06:42.269
I don't know if I will.

06:42.269 --> 06:44.104
We both said
some pretty harsh shit.

06:44.104 --> 06:45.673
Yeah.

06:45.673 --> 06:47.508
Good evening, gentlemen.

06:47.508 --> 06:48.609
Hey, Nash.

06:48.609 --> 06:49.710
Glad you made it.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.211
This will be fun.
I think.

06:51.211 --> 06:52.513
- Hmm.
- It'll be good for you.

06:52.513 --> 06:53.847
It'll be good
for both of you:

06:53.847 --> 06:55.348
a night out,
a change of scenery,

06:55.348 --> 06:56.650
Atlantic City.

07:01.889 --> 07:04.558
Oh! Check out this scene.

07:04.558 --> 07:06.193
Parental
guidance suggested.

07:06.193 --> 07:08.562
Fellas ready to do some stuff
you're going to regret?

07:08.562 --> 07:10.498
Who are we
waiting on?

07:10.498 --> 07:12.199
Just my best man.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.502
Oh. Here he is.

07:14.502 --> 07:17.505
What is up,
Barrycuda?

07:17.505 --> 07:19.072
Absolutely not.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.941
I'm not going to Atlantic City
with that specimen,

07:20.941 --> 07:22.510
let alone sitting
in a car with--

07:22.510 --> 07:24.077
Nash,
it'll be okay.
It'll be fine.

07:24.077 --> 07:25.979
- Let's fire up
that speedwagon.
- Wait.

07:25.979 --> 07:28.148
This side door has
a mind of its own. Sorry.

07:29.917 --> 07:30.884
All right.

07:30.884 --> 07:33.887
Whoa. No way, porkypine.
I got shotgun.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.556
- Yes, but--
- Back seat.

07:35.556 --> 07:38.358
Let's go. Let's go!

07:38.358 --> 07:40.227
Come on, Mr. Velour.

07:41.428 --> 07:42.796
I'm telling you,

07:42.796 --> 07:44.998
Feinberg has got it
in the bag.

07:44.998 --> 07:47.701
There's no way Getty hangs on
to the club presidency.

07:47.701 --> 07:48.969
He's too unpopular.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.037
Says who?

07:50.037 --> 07:51.238
Says everyone.

07:51.238 --> 07:52.439
David, are you
hearing this?

07:52.439 --> 07:53.574
Yeah, I'm staying
out of it.

07:53.574 --> 07:54.842
I'll tell you
something else.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.577
It's going to be
a whole new world.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.612
No more preferential
treatment by the board

07:58.612 --> 07:59.913
for you fuzzy
ball huggers

07:59.913 --> 08:01.281
when Stan's running things.

08:01.281 --> 08:04.051
Stan? Since when are you
on a first name basis?

08:04.051 --> 08:06.286
Since he started
taking golf lessons.

08:06.286 --> 08:07.721
Golf lessons.

08:07.721 --> 08:10.423
Like that's an actual sport
that requires lessons.

08:10.423 --> 08:12.626
It's the sport
of kings.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.595
That's horse racing.

08:14.595 --> 08:15.996
Well, it's the
pastime of kings.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.798
I refuse to consider
anything a sport

08:17.798 --> 08:19.132
when you don't
break a sweat.

08:19.132 --> 08:21.702
And when's the last time
you broke a sweat?

08:21.702 --> 08:23.103
Last night, actually,

08:23.103 --> 08:24.772
while I was making love
to your mother.

08:24.772 --> 08:26.574
- Dudes!
- You don't talk
about my mother.

08:26.574 --> 08:28.208
That's right. Served it
right up her--

08:28.208 --> 08:30.310
Enough with the hostility.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.680
It's like the Golan
Heights back here.

08:32.680 --> 08:34.014
Yeah. Come on.
Settle down, guys.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.749
We're trying to have
a good time here.

08:35.749 --> 08:38.619
Let's play a little game.
Story hour.

08:38.619 --> 08:41.454
20 bucks buys in.
Best story wins the pot.

08:41.454 --> 08:43.390
What kind of story?

08:43.390 --> 08:44.925
How you popped
your cherry.

08:44.925 --> 08:46.393
I'll start it.

08:46.393 --> 08:48.662
I was 18. She was 31.

08:48.662 --> 08:50.864
A stewardess
from Japan Airlines.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.400
A layover in Honolulu.

08:53.400 --> 08:54.668
Yukio.

08:54.668 --> 08:55.936
When it was all over,

08:55.936 --> 08:59.039
she offered me a hot towel
and a bag of nuts.

09:00.608 --> 09:01.675
Well done.

09:01.675 --> 09:03.010
All right,
you're up, Tonto.

09:03.010 --> 09:05.078
- Pass.
- You can't pass.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.479
My first time was with Karen.

09:06.479 --> 09:07.514
- Pass.
- I'll go.

09:07.514 --> 09:08.716
I was 15.

09:08.716 --> 09:10.383
My uncle Dal was home
on leave

09:10.383 --> 09:11.619
from
the Merchant Marines.

09:11.619 --> 09:13.053
He took me
to see a hooker.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.087
Dal was like

09:14.087 --> 09:15.155
"Go with Candi.

09:15.155 --> 09:16.389
She's my favorite."

09:16.389 --> 09:17.825
So she takes off
all her clothes.

09:17.825 --> 09:20.260
Then she puts a whole
bottle of baby oil

09:20.260 --> 09:21.629
all over her boobs.

09:21.629 --> 09:23.631
And she gets in the bed,
lies down--

09:23.631 --> 09:24.898
Gracie.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.067
Come on, sweetheart,
where are you?

09:28.135 --> 09:29.536
Gracie!

09:29.536 --> 09:31.271
Come on, Gracie.

09:33.641 --> 09:34.875
Gracie.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.744
- Yeah, Animal Control?
- Yeah.

09:36.744 --> 09:38.411
Did you happen
to find a cat today

09:38.411 --> 09:39.813
near Moss Acres Apartments?

09:39.813 --> 09:42.349
Uh, lost earlier
this afternoon.

09:42.349 --> 09:43.917
Uh, cute face.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.485
Uh, like, sort of
brown and white,

09:45.485 --> 09:46.787
gray and white,

09:46.787 --> 09:48.121
and it's got
a little jingle bell

09:48.121 --> 09:50.658
- on its collar.
- No, nothing like that.

09:50.658 --> 09:51.992
- Um...
- Okay.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.526
Yeah, but we'll be
on the lookout.

09:53.526 --> 09:54.695
Thank you.

10:05.372 --> 10:06.473
Hello.

10:06.473 --> 10:07.708
Hi.

10:07.708 --> 10:10.077
I'm sorry to bother you.

10:10.077 --> 10:12.545
I didn't know
who else to call.

10:12.545 --> 10:14.147
So I was 14 years old

10:14.147 --> 10:16.083
visiting my dad
in Albuquerque.

10:16.083 --> 10:19.386
So he has this live-in
housekeeper Nicole.

10:19.386 --> 10:22.489
French girl-- uh, woman.

10:22.489 --> 10:24.391
Anyway, my room
is next to hers

10:24.391 --> 10:25.893
with this connecting bathroom.

10:25.893 --> 10:28.261
So one night I got up to pee,

10:28.261 --> 10:31.699
and I walked in on her
taking a bath.

10:31.699 --> 10:34.501
I expected her to scream
and tell me to get out,

10:34.501 --> 10:35.903
but she didn't.

10:35.903 --> 10:37.537
She said I could
stay if I wanted.

10:37.537 --> 10:39.472
- Oh, my.
- And watch.

10:39.472 --> 10:40.941
So I did.

10:40.941 --> 10:42.375
The next night, too.

10:42.375 --> 10:43.877
This went on for a while

10:43.877 --> 10:46.714
until one night she says
I should get in with her.

10:46.714 --> 10:48.882
Wait a minute.
I know this story.

10:48.882 --> 10:52.619
You're describing the plot
of the film Private Lessons.

10:52.619 --> 10:54.121
Yeah.

10:54.121 --> 10:56.656
Disqualified.

10:56.656 --> 10:57.925
Come on, Wheeler.

10:57.925 --> 10:59.927
All right, all right,
Skip wins that round.

10:59.927 --> 11:01.394
Round 2. I want to know

11:01.394 --> 11:04.097
the freakiest place
you ever made it.

11:04.097 --> 11:05.332
I'll start.

11:05.332 --> 11:06.633
I was in art school.

11:06.633 --> 11:08.001
I was going out
with this girl

11:08.001 --> 11:09.803
who did make-up
on dead people.

11:09.803 --> 11:11.739
- Aah! Aah!
- Shit.
- Oh, the door.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.641
Jesus! Help!

11:14.641 --> 11:17.077
I'm getting out!
Barry! Barry!

11:19.747 --> 11:22.282
Oh, shit. Fuck.

11:22.282 --> 11:23.316
Is he dead?

11:24.551 --> 11:26.119
Barry?

11:33.493 --> 11:34.795
Gracie.

11:34.795 --> 11:36.797
Come on, honey.

11:36.797 --> 11:39.499
Here, puss puss puss.
Come on.

11:39.499 --> 11:43.136
Maybe she's with her friends
from the neighborhood.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.972
She doesn't have friends.

11:44.972 --> 11:46.774
I'm her only friend.

11:53.847 --> 11:55.482
Your friend
is going to be okay.

11:55.482 --> 11:58.285
He's got a few cracked ribs
and a minor concussion.

11:58.285 --> 12:01.521
But other than that, he should
make a full recovery.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.090
Thank God.

12:03.090 --> 12:05.292
I'm afraid I can
only take one of you
back to see him,

12:05.292 --> 12:07.294
so the rest
will have to wait here.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.299
Oh. Uh...

12:12.299 --> 12:14.167
does he have an IV?

12:14.167 --> 12:15.803
Yes.

12:15.803 --> 12:18.105
Yeah. Uh, sorry.
I can't do it.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.406
Needles freak me out, so--

12:20.473 --> 12:22.810
I'm serious.
I will pass out.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.450
Fine.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.895
Anyone else hungry?

12:44.364 --> 12:46.266
Yeah, I can get
something to eat.

12:53.841 --> 12:55.909
- Hey, Dad.
- We've sedated him

12:55.909 --> 12:57.410
and given him something
for the pain,

12:57.410 --> 12:59.847
so he may be
a little out of it.

13:01.849 --> 13:03.550
How do you feel?

13:03.550 --> 13:04.852
Fresno.

13:04.852 --> 13:08.221
Want me to call anyone?
Maybe Karen?

13:08.221 --> 13:10.257
Yeah.

13:10.257 --> 13:11.358
Tell her.

13:11.358 --> 13:13.393
Okay. Yeah.
I can do that.

13:15.028 --> 13:16.529
I love her.

13:18.765 --> 13:20.033
If I don't make it--

13:20.033 --> 13:21.701
Well, you're going
to make it.

13:21.701 --> 13:22.870
Gonna be tight.

13:22.870 --> 13:24.905
Starts at 9.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.473
Wait. What does?

13:26.473 --> 13:28.508
Copperfield.

13:29.877 --> 13:31.111
Oh, yeah. Barry,

13:31.111 --> 13:32.479
I don't think
that's going to happen.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.347
The doctors want
to watch you for a few hours

13:34.347 --> 13:35.916
just to make sure
you're okay.

13:35.916 --> 13:38.251
No.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.387
No.

13:40.387 --> 13:41.889
No!

13:41.889 --> 13:44.191
- Aah!
- Sir, please.

13:44.191 --> 13:45.725
- Get off me.
- You're--

13:45.725 --> 13:47.060
- You're a witch.
- You'll pull out--

13:47.060 --> 13:48.561
- Where are my legs?
- Hey! Hey!

13:48.561 --> 13:49.897
No!

13:53.901 --> 13:55.102
There you are.

13:55.102 --> 13:56.103
Mm.

13:56.103 --> 13:58.405
Sorry, dude.
We got the munchies.

13:58.405 --> 13:59.772
How's Barry?

13:59.772 --> 14:01.141
Pretty messed up.

14:01.141 --> 14:03.076
So random what happened.

14:03.076 --> 14:05.178
Really makes you think.

14:06.213 --> 14:09.116
Our lives are
but brief candles.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.152
You going
to finish that?

14:24.564 --> 14:25.933
Ow.

14:46.653 --> 14:48.288
Hi. You've reached me.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.590
Leave a message,
and I'll call you back.

15:00.267 --> 15:01.868
Hey.

15:01.868 --> 15:03.670
So who'd you just call?

15:05.872 --> 15:07.207
Yeah. Yeah.

15:07.207 --> 15:08.808
Where's, uh,
Skip and Nash?

15:08.808 --> 15:10.243
Nash is taking a leak,

15:10.243 --> 15:12.012
and Skip is hitting
on a woman

15:12.012 --> 15:14.314
who I don't think
he realizes is a hooker.

15:15.782 --> 15:18.118
So, uh, did you, uh,

15:18.118 --> 15:20.887
did you decide you're
going to take that job
with, uh, Getty?

15:20.887 --> 15:22.289
I don't know.

15:24.992 --> 15:26.126
Your friend is gone.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.995
- What?
- He yanked out his IV

15:27.995 --> 15:29.396
and took off.

15:37.204 --> 15:38.805
Where can he have gone?

15:38.805 --> 15:40.573
Not far in a hospital gown.

15:40.573 --> 15:41.808
Uh...

15:41.808 --> 15:44.177
Hey. Hey.

15:44.177 --> 15:45.812
Did you see a guy
in a hospital gown
run through here?

15:45.812 --> 15:49.016
Mustache, really nice hair,
a little out of it.

15:49.016 --> 15:50.450
Which way did he go?

15:53.853 --> 15:56.289
Barry! Barry!

15:57.924 --> 16:00.527
Come on, Sam. It's late.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.130
Try again tomorrow.

16:03.130 --> 16:05.032
Maybe put up signs.

16:07.034 --> 16:08.301
Okay.

16:14.541 --> 16:16.043
I'll go talk
to the guy up front.

16:16.043 --> 16:17.210
I'll give you 25
for it.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.611
That's highway
fucking robbery.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.747
- It's my final offer, boys.
- Come on.

16:20.747 --> 16:22.915
I like it, but I got to
make money off this thing.

16:22.915 --> 16:24.551
For real.

16:24.551 --> 16:25.518
That's it.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.891
Son of a bitch.

16:31.891 --> 16:35.062
Who's the lucky lady?

16:35.062 --> 16:36.729
My ex-wife.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.798
That is the engagement
ring I bought her.

16:38.798 --> 16:40.833
She comes here all the time
to play the slots,

16:40.833 --> 16:42.102
the fickle whore.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.072
How much did she pawn it for?

16:45.072 --> 16:46.306
I can't tell you that.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.241
Well, then how much
are you selling it for?

16:49.876 --> 16:50.910
80.

16:50.910 --> 16:53.346
Huh. 80? Dollars?

16:53.346 --> 16:55.082
That is 14-karat rose gold.

16:55.082 --> 16:58.085
She could have gotten twice
as much for that in the city.

16:58.085 --> 16:59.552
You know what? I'll take it.

16:59.552 --> 17:01.088
Help you?

17:01.088 --> 17:02.322
I'm looking for a friend.

17:02.322 --> 17:03.823
Tall guy, hospital gown.
Did he come in here?

17:03.823 --> 17:05.225
Oh, yeah.
A real freak show.

17:05.225 --> 17:07.094
- I almost called the cops.
- How long ago?

17:07.094 --> 17:08.928
I don't know.
Maybe 20 minutes.

17:08.928 --> 17:10.730
He pawned a gold chain
for cash.

17:10.730 --> 17:11.998
Had me call him a cab.

17:11.998 --> 17:13.200
Any idea where he's headed?

17:13.200 --> 17:15.602
The Trump, to see
what's-his-name--

17:15.602 --> 17:18.238
illusionist guy.
Made the Statue
of Liberty vanish.

17:18.238 --> 17:20.107
- Common--
- Hey! Don't!

17:20.107 --> 17:21.941
- Garbage wench!
- Don't!

17:21.941 --> 17:23.343
Stop!
What are you doing?

17:23.343 --> 17:24.977
Get him out of here
before I call the cops.

17:24.977 --> 17:27.214
Nash, stop! Stop! Stop!

17:31.984 --> 17:33.653
Look, we need
to find Barry, okay?

17:33.653 --> 17:35.322
He went to the Trump
to see Copperfield.

17:35.322 --> 17:37.124
What? But it's 3:30
in the morning.

17:37.124 --> 17:38.858
Copperfield's been
over for hours.

17:38.858 --> 17:40.360
Oh.

17:50.170 --> 17:51.838
Well, I'll be.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.406
What?

17:54.974 --> 17:57.744
I don't think
this is my ex's ring.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.780
I had our initials
engraved on the inside.

18:14.327 --> 18:16.729
She was such a good cat.

18:16.729 --> 18:18.865
Here. Drink this.

18:18.865 --> 18:20.032
I hate tea.

18:20.032 --> 18:21.568
It'll make you feel better.

18:25.037 --> 18:29.342
She had the makings of
an excellent mouser, too.

18:29.342 --> 18:32.945
I had no idea you were
such a cat person.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.381
Me, neither.

18:34.381 --> 18:36.616
It was nice, you know?

18:37.917 --> 18:41.087
Not having to come home
to an empty apartment.

18:41.087 --> 18:42.389
Hmm.

18:42.389 --> 18:44.090
We'd sit on the couch,

18:44.090 --> 18:46.193
watch "Jeopardy!"

18:46.193 --> 18:47.827
She was smart, too.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.299
One time the Daily Double
was "Who was the founder

18:52.299 --> 18:55.768
of the People's
Republic of China?"

18:55.768 --> 18:58.671
She knew the answer.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.207
Mao.

19:03.075 --> 19:04.344
Ahh.

19:12.685 --> 19:14.321
- Oh, no.
- I'm sorry.

19:14.321 --> 19:15.822
- Sam.
- I'm sorry, Judy.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.924
No. Um, I should go.

19:17.924 --> 19:19.659
Please don't go.

19:21.261 --> 19:22.495
Judy.

19:37.610 --> 19:38.745
What now?

19:38.745 --> 19:40.247
I don't know.

19:40.247 --> 19:41.748
Gentlemen, I think
it might be time

19:41.748 --> 19:43.483
to contact the local
authorities

19:43.483 --> 19:45.252
and call it a night.

19:45.252 --> 19:46.519
What?

19:46.519 --> 19:47.987
Yeah, I got to be at
the club in two hours

19:47.987 --> 19:49.256
for a kids' clinic.

19:49.256 --> 19:51.057
We can't just leave Barry.

19:51.057 --> 19:52.792
There's nothing more
to be done.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.361
He's in God's hands now.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.264
I can't believe
you bag of dicks

19:57.264 --> 19:59.065
are talking about
just ditching him.

19:59.065 --> 20:00.600
What happened to
no man left behind?

20:00.600 --> 20:02.302
We're co-workers,
not Marines.

20:02.302 --> 20:03.603
Yeah, dude. Chill.

20:04.671 --> 20:06.539
Don't tell me to chill,
you wombat.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.608
- Hey.
- We wouldn't be having
this conversation

20:08.608 --> 20:11.043
if it wasn't for that piece
of shit you call a car.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.613
That piece of shit
belonged to my granddaddy.

20:13.613 --> 20:14.914
Get your finger
out of my face.

20:14.914 --> 20:17.216
Hey, Wheeler,
it's not worth it.

20:17.216 --> 20:20.119
Just ignore him.
Let's go home.

20:20.119 --> 20:21.288
Whoa.

20:22.154 --> 20:24.190
Get out of my way.

20:24.190 --> 20:26.326
Or what?

20:26.326 --> 20:28.261
Or I'll box your ears.

20:29.796 --> 20:31.331
I don't even know
what that means.

20:31.331 --> 20:32.899
Well, you don't
want to find out.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.334
Oh, really?

20:34.334 --> 20:36.002
Let's see what you got,
fuck face.

20:36.002 --> 20:37.404
Hey, hey! Hey! Hey!

20:40.239 --> 20:42.409
God. Stop.

20:45.978 --> 20:47.980
Barry! Barry!

20:49.282 --> 20:51.284
Hey. You okay?

20:51.284 --> 20:54.621
Ohh. Yeah. Better now.

20:55.522 --> 20:56.956
- Ugh.
- Uch.

20:56.956 --> 20:59.726
Should have never mixed
grape and grain.

20:59.726 --> 21:00.893
Yeah.

21:02.429 --> 21:04.063
Where's my shoes go?

21:04.063 --> 21:07.199
It's kind of a long story.

21:07.199 --> 21:09.336
Yeah. We'll tell you
on the ride home.

21:11.338 --> 21:12.505
Hey, I didn't--

21:12.505 --> 21:14.407
I didn't do anything,

21:14.407 --> 21:16.676
like, to piss Karen off.

21:16.676 --> 21:19.145
You know, stuff with,
like, other women.

21:19.145 --> 21:20.780
No, man. You're fine.

21:20.780 --> 21:23.350
Whew. Oh, good.

21:24.451 --> 21:25.852
Because I wouldn't
want to ruin it.

21:27.354 --> 21:28.788
I love her,

21:28.788 --> 21:30.623
and I know that's got
to be freaky-deaky

21:30.623 --> 21:33.125
for you to hear,
but that's my truth.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.862
No. I'm glad, seriously

21:39.399 --> 21:40.900
Where's Nash?

21:53.380 --> 21:54.714
You okay?

21:56.749 --> 21:57.750
No.

22:00.853 --> 22:04.056
I know it sucks,
but you'll get over her.

22:04.056 --> 22:05.858
You'll find someone new.

22:10.096 --> 22:11.831
I'm turning 40 next month.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.834
And I always imagined
that by the age of 40

22:14.834 --> 22:16.769
I would be retired
from tennis,

22:16.769 --> 22:20.407
living on my boat
the Windbreaker

22:20.407 --> 22:23.743
with a woman half my age
by my side.

22:27.947 --> 22:29.782
Hey, fellas...

22:34.687 --> 22:37.123
You guys ready
to hit the road?

22:39.626 --> 22:41.327
**

22:41.327 --> 22:42.629
Yeah.

23:10.523 --> 23:12.091
* Went to a doctor *

23:12.091 --> 23:14.561
**

23:29.375 --> 23:30.777
Ohh.

23:33.813 --> 23:35.181
Ahh.

23:35.181 --> 23:36.516
Morning.

23:41.654 --> 23:44.557
Thanks, little buddy.
I mean it.

23:44.557 --> 23:46.726
I don't remember much,

23:46.726 --> 23:48.561
but I'll never forget it.

23:50.697 --> 23:53.365
And you, Wheel Man,

23:53.365 --> 23:55.702
you're definitely
coming to my wedding.

23:55.702 --> 23:57.203
Can I bring a date?

23:57.203 --> 23:58.738
If she can dance.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.010
Nasser.

24:05.512 --> 24:06.613
Skip.

24:07.514 --> 24:08.748
I'm gonna grab a shower.

24:08.748 --> 24:10.149
I'll see you
at the pro shop.

24:12.652 --> 24:15.121
I've never seen him
so down.

24:15.121 --> 24:16.222
I know.

24:16.222 --> 24:17.389
It's his birthday soon.

24:17.389 --> 24:18.691
We should
do something for him.

24:18.691 --> 24:20.259
Take his mind off
turning 40.

24:20.259 --> 24:22.294
That's a good idea.

24:22.294 --> 24:23.696
Ohh.

24:23.696 --> 24:25.632
Hey, I'm going to go
catch some Z's

24:25.632 --> 24:27.066
before my shift.

24:27.066 --> 24:28.100
Lucky.

24:28.100 --> 24:29.636
Catch you later.

24:34.040 --> 24:37.577
By the way, you should
go see Skye, talk to her.

24:37.577 --> 24:39.546
You think?

24:40.547 --> 24:41.748
Definitely.

25:00.733 --> 25:02.234
* Baby *

25:02.234 --> 25:05.204
* Life's what you make it *

25:07.306 --> 25:10.142
* Cannot escape it *

25:21.621 --> 25:23.122
* Baby *

25:23.122 --> 25:26.626
* Yesterday's favorite *

25:28.027 --> 25:31.230
* Don't you hate it? *

25:36.736 --> 25:38.738
* Everything's
all right *

25:38.738 --> 25:41.941
* Life's what you make it *

25:46.746 --> 25:50.850
* Everything's
all right *

25:52.752 --> 25:54.687
* Baby *

25:54.687 --> 25:57.624
* Life's what you make it *

25:59.525 --> 26:02.261
* Don't back-date it *

26:13.806 --> 26:15.642
* Baby *

26:15.642 --> 26:18.277
* Don't try to shade it *

26:20.379 --> 26:23.282
* Beauty is naked *
