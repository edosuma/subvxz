Hey, yesterday’s food’s
still here.
And the day before’s.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.778
I don’t think Matilda’s
moved in two days.

00:30.907 --> 00:34.399
/ hope she ’s not sic/c
Maybe there is
something wrong.

00:34.493 --> 00:36.324
Should we call the vet?

[Roars]

01:00.228 --> 01:01.468
Let’s go.
Thanks

01:01.562 --> 01:03.302
I was here
last weekend with Parker.

01:03.397 --> 01:06.013
They got monkeys
swinging free right over there.
You think we have the time?

01:06.108 --> 01:09.316
[Brennan]
Booth, we are here
to reco vera set of remains.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.860
Come on, Bones. You gotta take time
to smell the primates.

01:11.948 --> 01:14.314
Why? They’re ma/oo’orous
and they throw
their excrement

01:14.408 --> 01:17.241
[Growling]

01:17.328 --> 01:19.614
[Booth]
Who wanders around
in an animal park?

01:19.705 --> 01:21.866
[Brennan]
Someone with
extreme/ypoorjuo’gment

01:21.958 --> 01:24.370
[Booth]
Huh. Guess no one told this guy
it’s not a petting zoo.

01:24.460 --> 01:26.576
Never mind.

01:26.671 --> 01:29.333
The flesh has been gnawed
and baked in the sun.

01:29.423 --> 01:34.383
But the nasal root
suggests a black male
well over six feet tall.

01:34.470 --> 01:37.462
According to Parker’s
Big Book ofAnimals,

01:37.556 --> 01:41.219
you know, they can pounce
at 35 miles per hour
and leap 30 feet.

01:42.520 --> 01:44.556
The tiger fed on the flesh...

01:44.647 --> 01:47.013
and internal organs
before he started
cleaning the bones.

01:47.108 --> 01:49.599
You know, I’m thinking
the victim wandered away
from his car.

01:49.694 --> 01:51.730
He was drunk,
and he ended up in this area.

01:51.821 --> 01:54.312
Same thing happened
to a guy last year
in the giraffe section.

01:54.407 --> 01:56.523
Giraffes are herbivores.
They don’t eat people.

01:56.617 --> 02:00.201
That part is different.
The guy broke his arm.

02:00.288 --> 02:04.247
- Did you know that giraffes
can weigh up to two tons?
- Yes. Everyone knows that.

02:04.333 --> 02:07.871
- And they sleep less than two hours a day.
- That I did not know.

02:07.962 --> 02:10.829
Yes!
Pinky stumps the Brain.

02:10.923 --> 02:13.585
Well, I have no way
ofdetermining
cause ofdeath out here.

02:13.676 --> 02:16.588
So we should pack
everything up and
bring it back to the lab.

02:16.679 --> 02:18.385
Pack it up.
[Grow/s]

02:20.558 --> 02:22.514
[Roars]

02:22.601 --> 02:24.728
Teeth marks in the manubrium
and the sternum.

02:24.812 --> 02:28.304
Nice to have you back,
Dr. Edison. I wasn’t sure
we’d see you again.

02:28.399 --> 02:31.641
Dr. Brennan assured me that
I could count on a strictly
professional atmosphere.

02:31.736 --> 02:33.818
I admire your focus
and dedication to
your work, Dr. Edison.

02:33.904 --> 02:36.441
Thoracolumbar fascia
has been eaten.

02:36.532 --> 02:40.616
No stomach contents
for me to analyze because
the tiger ate the stomach.

02:40.703 --> 02:44.491
Don’t blame the tiger.
Animals shouldn’t be confined
for human amusement.

02:44.582 --> 02:46.368
- A 200 hater?
- And a vegan.

02:46.500 --> 02:50.038
Oh. Someone’s revealing their
plant—based personal life.
It relates to the case.

02:50.129 --> 02:53.121
Zoos have many breeding programs
to preserve endangered species.

02:53.215 --> 02:55.797
Animals bred in zoos
have weak natural instincts.

02:55.885 --> 02:58.877
- They’re basicallyjust imprisoned pets.
- Pets generally don’t eat you.

02:58.971 --> 03:01.758
Common house cat
will devouryou
before you’re cold.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.636
The victim’s hyoid
and spinal cord
are still intact.

03:04.727 --> 03:08.766
There are no Indications
of a trac/it/ona/ tiger
throat bite or strangleho/o’.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.767
The tiger was not
the cause ofdeath.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.474
I agree.
Some kind ofweapon...

03:13.569 --> 03:17.187
sliced along what’s left of
the right pelvis and thigh,
transecting the femoral artery.

03:17.281 --> 03:19.363
He died ofa good
old-fashioned bleed out.

03:19.450 --> 03:24.035
There’s a shoelace
mixed in with the flesh.

03:24.121 --> 03:26.533
The tiger could’ve
coughed it up like a fur ball.

03:26.624 --> 03:29.366
Judging from decomp
and the amount the tiger ate,

03:29.460 --> 03:33.749
/ est/mate time of death
to be late Friday night,
early Saturday

03:33.839 --> 03:35.750
Welcome back, Clark.

03:35.841 --> 03:37.923
Whoa. Ha ve you
been working out?

03:38.052 --> 03:40.964
Excuse me?
You look so solid
and compact.

03:42.681 --> 03:45.593
I believe that all conversation
should relate to this man’s murder.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.595
Angela’s taking a stab
at celibacy.

03:47.686 --> 03:50.348
Sweets thinks
it will help me form
more committed relationships.

03:50.439 --> 03:52.304
But itjust seems to rev up her libido—

03:52.400 --> 03:54.937
Chewing has
embedded particulates...

03:55.027 --> 03:58.110
into the teeth marks
in the medial malleolus.

03:58.197 --> 04:01.655
Okay, I get it.
But you’re squeezable.

04:03.119 --> 04:05.861
We should thank our tiger
for not eating
the Victim ’s teeth.

04:05.955 --> 04:07.536
Denta/s gave us an easy match.

04:07.623 --> 04:10.956
[Brennan]
Dr. Andrew We/ton.

04:13.045 --> 04:16.208
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, it’s-it’s dentals.

04:16.298 --> 04:19.790
Doesn’t take a rocket scientist
to /. D. off den ta/s.
Sad huh?

04:19.885 --> 04:22.046
He was handsome.
He’s hot, really.

04:22.138 --> 04:23.878
Okay, that’s enough,
Angela.

04:26.183 --> 04:28.014
Are you all right, Dr. Saroyan?

04:31.021 --> 04:34.354
No.
I knew Dr. Welton.

04:34.442 --> 04:37.400
We lived together
for two years.

04:37.486 --> 04:40.353
Oh, my God, Cam.
I’m really sorry.

04:40.448 --> 04:43.611
No— Let’sjust find out
who killed him.

04:43.701 --> 04:45.692
Okay?

05:25.868 --> 05:27.859
[Sniffles]

05:27.953 --> 05:31.696
So I called the hospital, and Dr. Welton
has been missing for two days.

05:33.918 --> 05:36.455
I’m sorry, Cam.
[Sighs]

05:36.545 --> 05:39.503
I haven’t even
seen Andrew for 10 years.

05:39.590 --> 05:42.172
It’s silly for me to be
reacting like this.

05:42.259 --> 05:44.875
No, it’s not.
You know what?

05:45.012 --> 05:49.756
He was a big part ofyour life.
What about his daughter?

05:49.892 --> 05:53.055
Who’s gonna tell Michelle?
Had he remarried, or—
No.

05:53.145 --> 05:55.557
No other family.

05:55.648 --> 05:57.604
Yeah,
I’m not surprised.

05:58.901 --> 06:00.937
Michelle’s mom died
during childbirth,

06:01.028 --> 06:05.362
and I don’t think Andrew
could ever go through loving
anyone like that again.

06:05.449 --> 06:07.405
Michelle became
everything to him.

06:08.661 --> 06:10.617
She must be, what,
16 now?

06:12.122 --> 06:14.033
Yeah.

06:14.124 --> 06:17.287
What a terrible time
to lose her father.

06:17.419 --> 06:20.752
Listen, Bones and |, we’ll—
we’ll get the social worker.
No.

06:20.839 --> 06:22.795
No social worker.
[Snifﬂes]

06:22.883 --> 06:26.671
Ifthere’s no one else,
I have to do it. I’ll talk to her.

06:26.762 --> 06:29.970
Look, Cam, it’s been 10 years
since you’ve seen her.

06:30.057 --> 06:33.174
I was her mom for almost
two years, Seeley.

06:33.269 --> 06:35.385
She should hear it
from someone who—

06:36.897 --> 06:38.933
someone who loved her father.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.572
So, you sure
you don’t want us
to come in with you?

06:52.663 --> 06:55.325
No. I’ll be fine.

07:12.808 --> 07:15.424
Cam raised her?
Yep, for two years.

07:19.523 --> 07:23.857
Camille Saroyan?
And you know my dad?

07:23.944 --> 07:26.936
You were four
when your father and l
were together.

07:27.031 --> 07:29.397
I moved awayjust after
you turned six.

07:29.491 --> 07:32.904
But I remember your party.
You were sitting
on the clown’s lap...

07:32.995 --> 07:35.737
while he made balloon animals,
and he kept handing them to me.

07:35.873 --> 07:38.660
And / had this
armfu/ of them—
I don’t remember.

07:38.751 --> 07:40.662
And my dad’s
not here right now.

07:40.753 --> 07:42.869
I know.

07:42.963 --> 07:45.545
I’m working on a case
with the F.B.|., Michelle.

07:45.633 --> 07:48.750
C ou/d you please
sit do wn .7

07:53.641 --> 07:55.427
Well, she told me
she never wanted to have kids.

07:55.517 --> 07:57.803
Maybe Michelle
is the reason.

07:57.895 --> 07:59.726
I don’t understand.

07:59.813 --> 08:03.476
She loved Welton,
lived with him
for about two years.

08:03.567 --> 08:06.479
And she raised Michelle
like she was her own.

08:06.570 --> 08:08.481
And then she’s been alone
for all that time because...

08:08.572 --> 08:10.938
she doesn’t wanna
put herselfin
that position again.

08:11.033 --> 08:15.527
- But that was 10 years ago.
- For Cam, there are emotional
considerations here.

08:15.621 --> 08:17.737
That’s why she has
to be involved in the case.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.867
With us?

08:19.958 --> 08:23.416
It’s best that you...
stay in the lab...

08:23.504 --> 08:26.120
a little bit more,
just this time around.

08:26.215 --> 08:29.252
Because that’s where
I’m most useful.
I understand.

08:29.343 --> 08:33.757
No, you and Cam can rely on
your statistically inaccurate guts
to solve the case.

08:33.847 --> 08:37.886
She needs this.
Just trust me on this, Bones.

08:41.563 --> 08:43.849
Last time I saw him
was Friday night.

08:43.941 --> 08:48.355
He was getting ready for some
hospital party at the animal park.

08:48.445 --> 08:51.027
/ spent the weekend
at my ﬂ‘iend’s.

08:51.115 --> 08:53.231
I’m-I’m sure that he’s
still at the hospital.

08:53.325 --> 08:55.611
Michelle,
we found your father.

08:56.954 --> 08:59.866
I’m very soriy to have to tell you...

08:59.957 --> 09:03.290
that he’s— he passed away.

09:05.921 --> 09:10.085
What? No.

09:10.175 --> 09:13.713
No. He was fine.

09:13.804 --> 09:17.262
He was fine.
I saw him two days ago.
You’re wrong.

09:17.349 --> 09:19.965
I’m so sorry, honey.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.723
is anyone staying with you?

09:23.814 --> 09:26.271
Um, our housekeeper,
Mrs.Jenks.

09:26.358 --> 09:29.441
But she’s—

09:29.528 --> 09:32.361
What happened?
He was healthy.

09:32.448 --> 09:34.313
We believe he was killed.

09:34.408 --> 09:36.865
What?
Oh, my God.

09:36.952 --> 09:38.988
Oh, my God
[Sobbing ]

09:39.997 --> 09:42.989
Look. I don’t even
know you, okay?

09:43.083 --> 09:46.450
Why don’t you just do yourjob
and find out who did this
to my dad.

09:46.545 --> 09:48.706
[Door C loses ]

09:48.797 --> 09:52.289
- Is everything all right?
- My dad— She says that
my dad has been murdered.

09:52.384 --> 09:55.376
Oh, good God.

09:55.471 --> 09:57.382
How could you tell her alone?

09:57.514 --> 09:59.800
Why didn ’t you call me?
|_

09:59.892 --> 10:03.885
I thought she’d remember me.
I was a friend ofthe family.

10:03.979 --> 10:05.719
I think you should go.

10:05.814 --> 10:09.398
I know this is difficult,
but I have to ask a few questions.

10:09.485 --> 10:12.022
- Now?
- In order to pursue
an investigation—

10:12.112 --> 10:14.899
What? What do you
want to know?

10:16.533 --> 10:19.696
Did your father have... any enemies?

10:19.787 --> 10:21.698
Any difficult relationships?

10:21.789 --> 10:24.496
No.
Everybody loved him.

10:24.583 --> 10:28.496
You said that you knew him.
You should know that.

10:39.431 --> 10:42.468
How’d it go?

10:42.559 --> 10:47.724
You should’ve brought
a social worker. She didn’t
remember me at all.

10:49.691 --> 10:51.397
[Engine Starts]

10:58.075 --> 11:00.532
[Clark]
1 ook at the pelvis.

11:00.619 --> 11:04.362
[Brennan]
Surface lacerations to the
periosteum of the pelvic bone.

11:04.456 --> 11:05.957
Those aren’t bone chips.

11:06.041 --> 11:07.872
Whatever caused the laceration
embedded something in the bone.

11:07.960 --> 11:12.203
Look at the injuries near the femoral artery.
Looks like there are particles of mica in here.

11:12.297 --> 11:15.835
The scarring on the i'li'um
indicates that something
gouged the victim.

11:15.926 --> 11:17.462
I’ll start testing
possible weapons.

11:17.594 --> 11:20.802
Do you have anything?
Well, a thorough
examination takes time.

11:20.931 --> 11:23.718
Let’s not take too much time.
Well, we’re being
so thorough that we can—

11:23.809 --> 11:28.052
There’s a killer out there,
Dr. Edison.
So be thorough and fast.

11:28.146 --> 11:30.728
/ have the results
of Welton ’s tox screen.

11:30.816 --> 11:34.058
There were opiates in his blood.
Hydrocodone and carisoprodol.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.810
Perhaps he
was self—medicating.
That doesn’t sound like Andrew.

11:36.905 --> 11:38.816
You haven’t seen him
in years.

11:38.907 --> 11:41.284
These are very high levels
ofopiates to have in
your system ifyou’re a surgeon.

11:41.368 --> 11:44.280
It’s not uncommon for doctors
to have substance abuse issues.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.282
Andrew was not
a drug abuser.

11:46.373 --> 11:49.160
Look for physical indicators
that might warrant opiate use.

11:51.336 --> 11:53.827
I’m meeting Booth at
the hospital ifyou have
any information,

11:53.922 --> 11:56.004
which I hope you will.

11:59.469 --> 12:02.711
I took Michelle to ballet class
and parent-teacher conferences,

12:02.806 --> 12:04.888
and | read herto sleep.

12:04.975 --> 12:07.842
And when I saw her, it all came back.
I thought it would for her.

12:07.978 --> 12:10.264
Some of it, at least.
Listen, Parker’s seven.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.934
He can’t even remember
how to put on his underwear.
But he knows you.

12:13.025 --> 12:15.232
He knows what
you’ve done for him.

12:15.319 --> 12:17.184
It’s been 10 years.
People move on.

12:17.321 --> 12:20.859
It’sjust a relationship that didn’t work out.
It’s a family, Seeley.

12:20.949 --> 12:23.110
- Family that didn’t work out.
- Camille.

12:23.201 --> 12:26.534
- Maura. It’s been a longtime.
- It’s horrible what happened.

12:26.622 --> 12:29.034
Yeah. This is
Special Agent Booth.

12:29.124 --> 12:31.615
Dr. Bailey is Roosevelt’s
chiefadministrator.

12:31.710 --> 12:34.042
Dr. Bailey, I’d like to ask you
a few questions about Dr. Welton.

12:34.129 --> 12:37.212
Of course.
Let’s find some privacy.

12:37.299 --> 12:40.291
We were both residents here.
It was a really
competitive environment.

12:40.385 --> 12:42.467
Does Michelle know?

12:42.596 --> 12:45.588
Yes. I saw her this morning.
Oh. Poor kid.

12:45.682 --> 12:47.593
You two were pretty close
as I remember.

12:47.684 --> 12:52.348
Dr. Bailey, we believe that Dr. Welton
was killed at the benefit Friday night.

12:52.481 --> 12:55.188
At the animal park?
He was found
in the tiger habitat.

12:55.275 --> 12:58.017
We need a list of everyone
who attended the benefit.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.818
Staff, caterers, park personnel
assigned to the event.

13:00.906 --> 13:03.238
- Of course.
- Dr. Welton have any enemies?

13:03.325 --> 13:06.317
The staffloved him.

13:06.411 --> 13:08.823
In the spirit of full disclosure,
though, you should know...

13:08.914 --> 13:11.781
Dr. Welton and I had
our share of disagreements.

13:11.917 --> 13:15.705
It’s an occupational hazard.
Maura always did like
being in charge.

13:15.796 --> 13:17.787
I am in charge now, Camille.

13:17.881 --> 13:21.794
Andrew and I had
policy disagreements.

13:21.885 --> 13:25.503
But I admired him.
He was the best
cardiovascular surgeon I knew.

13:25.597 --> 13:28.009
How about any other patients?
People outside ofthe hospital?

13:28.100 --> 13:30.637
Malpractice suits
are par for the course
in any hospital.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.683
And we are fighting 15
right now.

13:32.771 --> 13:35.353
I’m gonna need a list
ofall those lawsuits
naming Dr. Welton.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.021
Of course.

13:37.109 --> 13:39.065
Andrew usually made
his rounds at night.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.063
Who would’ve seen him before
he went to the benefit?

13:41.154 --> 13:44.112
You should check with the nurses
in the cardiac unit.

13:44.199 --> 13:47.532
Dr. Welton was the best.
Everyone loved him.

13:47.661 --> 13:50.073
He lived
for his patients.
And his daughter.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.575
Dr. W made his rounds
before the beneﬁt

13:52.666 --> 13:54.577
I helped him change
a chest tube.

13:54.668 --> 13:57.205
And I had to push him aside
so his tux didn’t get dirty.

13:57.295 --> 13:59.331
Other than that,
it was just like
any other night.

13:59.423 --> 14:01.584
And no arguments
with patients or family members?

14:01.675 --> 14:03.631
With Dr. Welton?
No.

14:03.719 --> 14:06.506
Do you know if he was
taking anyone to the benefit?

14:06.596 --> 14:09.588
I told him he could take me.
He looked likeJames Bond.

14:09.683 --> 14:13.767
You never knew who Dr. Welton
was dating. He wasn’t
the type to settle down.

14:13.854 --> 14:15.719
Right.

14:17.858 --> 14:19.849
How’s it goin’?
Hey.

14:19.943 --> 14:22.559
Ooh.
What is that smell?

14:22.654 --> 14:26.272
- Are you wearing cologne?
- It’s urine.

14:26.366 --> 14:31.156
I found traces of uric acid
on the victim’s clothing.

14:31.246 --> 14:34.579
- Oh.
- It was the pheromones
you found pleasing.

14:34.666 --> 14:36.952
Yeah. Uh, the pheromones
in tiger urine?

14:37.044 --> 14:38.955
Well, I assume
it’s tiger urine.

14:39.087 --> 14:43.421
The cat was probably
marking its territory
l was turned on by tiger urine?

14:43.508 --> 14:46.500
[Chuckles]
Celibacy isn’t easy, Ange.

14:46.595 --> 14:48.085
[Sighs]
Tell me about it.

14:48.180 --> 14:50.592
/ don ’t know
why Sweets thinks...

14:50.682 --> 14:53.765
this is gonna help form
more stable relationships.

14:53.852 --> 14:56.889
Sex is the glue.
We were like epoxy.

14:56.980 --> 14:59.722
Sometimes,
relationships need
more thanjust sex.

14:59.816 --> 15:03.729
Okay.
Okay, I get it.

15:03.820 --> 15:06.937
I wasn’t wrong about Clark,
though, was I? I mean,
he’s cute, and he’s built.

15:07.032 --> 15:10.490
Yeah, not too comfortable with
this part ofthe conversation.

15:10.577 --> 15:13.990
I’mjust saying.
I’m allowed to look,
right?

15:14.122 --> 15:16.078
[Sighs]
Sure.
And remember.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.407
Remember?

15:18.502 --> 15:20.868
Yeah.

15:20.962 --> 15:25.922
You shouldjoin a gym.
Go for a run to burn off
some ofyour excess...

15:26.009 --> 15:27.715
whatever it is.

15:27.803 --> 15:30.169
I really, uh,
need to get back to my—

15:30.305 --> 15:32.512
UHne?
Yeah.

15:35.393 --> 15:38.351
I found nodules
of ossified cartilage...

15:38.438 --> 15:42.807
on Welton’s thumbs between
the metacarpals and carpals.

15:42.901 --> 15:46.234
He was suffering from
syno vial chondromatosis.

15:46.321 --> 15:49.484
He was in pain.
That would explain the opiates.

15:49.574 --> 15:53.237
I also found ibuprofen,

15:53.328 --> 15:55.990
which he would’ve taken
to reduce the inflammation.

15:56.081 --> 15:58.322
The bony growths
in his wrists...

15:58.416 --> 16:00.998
would’ve caused him pain
and se vere/y restricted
his mob/lily

16:01.086 --> 16:04.328
It would’ve been very dangerous
for him to perform surgery
in his condition.

16:04.422 --> 16:06.037
Well, he wouldn’t have done it.
Not Andrew.

16:06.133 --> 16:08.875
You can’t know that.
People change in 10 years.

16:08.969 --> 16:11.836
- Not someone’s nature.
- We’re scientists.

16:11.930 --> 16:14.387
We can’t quantify or rely
on our emotions.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.760
They’re arbitrary and indeterminate.

16:16.852 --> 16:19.218
We know people through
ourfeelings, Dr. Brennan.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.223
You trust Booth
because ofwhat you feel.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.521
No, I trust Booth
because of past actions.

16:23.608 --> 16:26.600
And faith in the future.
I’m sorry, but feelings
are important.

16:26.736 --> 16:29.443
[Phone Rings]
Even to you.
Saroyan.

16:29.531 --> 16:32.739
So a guy named Brandon Casey...

16:32.826 --> 16:37.820
filed a malpractice suit after
his wife died during surgery
on Welton’s operating table.

16:37.914 --> 16:40.371
After the suit was arbitrated
in Welton’s favor,

16:40.458 --> 16:43.416
[ 0n Speakerphone]
Welton ﬁled a restraining order
against Casey

16:43.503 --> 16:45.414
Do you think Casey
killed Welton?

16:45.505 --> 16:50.420
Well, I don’t know.
But I do know that Casey
bought a ticket to the benefit.

16:50.510 --> 16:53.547
Why would someone
who sued the hospital
pay to go to its benefit?

16:59.102 --> 17:01.764
l, uh—
I don’t understand
why I’m here.

17:01.855 --> 17:04.517
Well, your wife died
during surgery performed
by Dr. Andrew Welton.

17:04.608 --> 17:06.519
Yes. That was two years ago.

17:06.610 --> 17:09.226
She was only 32 years old.
She had a congenital heart defect.

17:09.321 --> 17:11.152
And yet, he had to take out
a restraining order
against you?

17:11.239 --> 17:15.733
I was crazy when Alex died.
I needed to blame someone.

17:15.827 --> 17:18.864
And you attacked him,
which is why he had to take out
a restraining order.

17:18.955 --> 17:22.493
Which I get because,
you know,
got to let the anger go.

17:22.584 --> 17:26.953
I needed to find forgiveness,
even compassion for the doctor.

17:27.047 --> 17:29.789
He seems sincere.
But he still violated
the restraining order.

17:29.883 --> 17:33.091
And yet you went to
the benefit last Friday night,
ignoring the restraining order.

17:33.178 --> 17:36.511
I went to apologize.
I had accused this man ofmurder.

17:36.598 --> 17:38.429
lowed Dr. Welton an apology.

17:38.516 --> 17:40.598
And what did he say to you
after you apologized?

17:40.685 --> 17:44.223
Well, we didn’t get a chance to talk.
He was arguing with a woman.

17:44.314 --> 17:46.475
They were off to the side
and really going at it.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.431
/di'dn ’t want to get
in the middle of it. Okay

17:48.526 --> 17:50.357
What’s going on here?
Has something happened
to Dr. Welton?

17:50.445 --> 17:52.231
Yeah. He was murdered
Friday night.

17:52.322 --> 17:55.564
I’m— Oh, my God.

17:55.659 --> 17:58.742
- Do you know what
this woman looked like?
- No, I don’t. I— I’m—

17:58.828 --> 18:00.739
- What she was wearing?
- I don’t know.

18:00.830 --> 18:03.082
Was she tall?
Was she short?
Nothing?

18:03.208 --> 18:05.574
I’m sorry.
I don’t remember.
It’s possible, Booth.

18:05.669 --> 18:08.411
People don’t retain
what they don’t think
is important.

18:08.505 --> 18:11.417
Great.

18:11.508 --> 18:14.500
I beg your pardon?
Nothing.

18:14.594 --> 18:18.178
But the memories
are still formed. See if
he’ll agree to hypnosis.

18:22.936 --> 18:27.145
The gouge that extends
from the i'li'um
to the femur is deep...

18:27.232 --> 18:30.190
and seems to have torn
through the bone.

18:30.277 --> 18:34.270
Well, I found wounds
on the proximal phalanx
ofthe right fifth digit,

18:34.364 --> 18:35.945
as well as the
ulnartuberosity.

18:36.074 --> 18:38.736
Defensive wounds.
Yes, caused by
blunt force.

18:38.827 --> 18:43.947
Hey / used the measurements
of the injuries trying different
scenarios on possible weapons.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.076
And you did this
whilejogging?

18:46.167 --> 18:49.876
Well, yeah. I was burning off
a little of my extra desire
on the way to work,

18:50.005 --> 18:53.463
sweat pea.
ls sweet pea an appropriate
workplace moniker?

18:53.550 --> 18:57.759
Don’t worry, Clark.
I won’t eat you,
not that I’m not tempted.

18:57.846 --> 18:59.677
Thank God.

18:59.764 --> 19:02.426
Most men would be
flattered by Angela’s
sexual interest in them.

19:02.517 --> 19:05.930
Well, my sexual needs
are well taken care of.
Thank you.

19:06.021 --> 19:09.354
- Really?
- Your results, Miss Montenegro.

19:12.152 --> 19:14.313
Okay.
[Typing]

19:14.404 --> 19:17.362
The force that
it would take to inflict
injuries this severe...

19:17.449 --> 19:20.031
would dictate either
an extremely strong person...

19:20.118 --> 19:23.360
over se ven feet tall wielding
a two-foot metal pole—

19:23.455 --> 19:25.787
Someone at the party
would’ve noticed a giant.

19:25.874 --> 19:27.705
Or...

19:27.792 --> 19:30.784
someone between
5’7”and5’7 7

19:30.879 --> 19:33.871
wielding a five-foot metal pole
with a 7 0—centimeter diameter.

19:33.965 --> 19:36.081
A metal pole ofthat
length and diameter...

19:36.176 --> 19:38.883
would be consistent with
the defensive injuries we found.

19:38.970 --> 19:40.585
Now we have to determine
what gouged the bone.

19:40.722 --> 19:44.635
Yeah, well, I’m gonna need
more information for that.
[Sweets ] Angela.

19:44.726 --> 19:48.344
- Can I borrow you
for a little while?
- To do what with?

19:48.438 --> 19:51.020
Sorry.
Thatjust popped out.

19:51.149 --> 19:52.764
/ needed a longer run.
Yeah, I understand.

19:52.859 --> 19:55.771
I’m gonna be
h ypnotizing a witness...

19:55.862 --> 19:58.274
who can’t remember a suspect,
and I need a sketch artist.

19:58.406 --> 20:01.068
Oh.
We’re finished.

20:01.159 --> 20:03.070
Cool.
I’m all yours, Sweets.

20:03.161 --> 20:05.322
All right.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.950
You are relaxed,
Mr. Casey.

20:12.045 --> 20:16.664
Totally relaxed
and completely aware
ofyour surroundings.

20:16.800 --> 20:20.839
Can you tell me my name?
Dr. Sweets.

20:20.929 --> 20:24.092
Yes. And we are
here together...

20:24.182 --> 20:27.345
at the animal park
at the hospital benefit.

20:27.435 --> 20:32.270
Yes. There’s so many
people here. And I keep
missing the hors d’oeuvres.

20:32.357 --> 20:34.814
[Chuckles]
You’ve gotta be kidding me.

20:34.901 --> 20:37.062
Shh.

20:37.153 --> 20:39.269
Have you spotted Dr. Welton yet?

20:39.364 --> 20:42.106
I know he’s here
someplace.

20:42.200 --> 20:45.158
[Sweets]
How do you feel, Mr. Casey?
Are you angry?

20:45.245 --> 20:47.156
[Guests Chattering]

20:47.247 --> 20:49.454
[Sweets Continues]
You thought this man
killed your wife.

20:49.541 --> 20:51.452
No. No, l was wrong.

20:51.543 --> 20:54.159
Looking fonivard
to seeing the doctor
and making amends.

20:54.254 --> 20:56.586
Would you like
some champagne?
No, thanks.

20:56.714 --> 21:01.504
Absolutely.
All right. Have you
spotted Dr. Welton yet?

21:01.594 --> 21:05.462
No. I keep trying
to get something to eat.
I didn’t have lunch.

21:05.557 --> 21:07.343
I’d like something to eat too.

21:07.434 --> 21:10.016
Okay,
here comes a waitress.

21:10.145 --> 21:11.976
Hi, there.
She’s giving you
what you want.

21:12.105 --> 21:16.974
Thank you.
Now, can you—
Can you see the doctor?

21:17.068 --> 21:19.684
Yes.
He ’5 over by the path.

21:19.779 --> 21:22.737
- What path?
- The path that leads
to the animals.

21:22.824 --> 21:26.817
I hear there’s no fence.
What ifthe animals can get out?

21:26.911 --> 21:30.119
[Sweets]
Don’t worry You are
perfectly safe, Mr. Casey

21:30.248 --> 21:32.614
[Elephant Grunting]
[Man]
Thank you very much.

21:32.709 --> 21:35.325
[Man #2]
A zebra over here.

21:35.420 --> 21:37.251
[Chattering Continues]

21:38.465 --> 21:40.877
[Man #3 ]
No, lagree.

21:44.721 --> 21:47.463
[Sweets ]
The animals won ’t hurt you.
They’re very friendly.

21:47.557 --> 21:49.388
Yes.
Yes, they are.

21:52.812 --> 21:55.519
You can see Dr. Welton
clearly now, can’t you?

21:55.607 --> 21:59.771
Is he alone?
No. He’s with a woman.

21:59.861 --> 22:04.571
- And they’re arguing?
- Yes. She ’s yelling at him.
He ’5 trying to calm her down.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.943
She’s pushing him.

22:07.035 --> 22:09.117
Look closer.
Tell me what she looks like.

22:09.204 --> 22:13.072
- No. I need to move away.
This is embarrassing.
- No. No, no, no, no.

22:13.166 --> 22:15.703
Not yet.
Look at the woman.

22:15.835 --> 22:19.419
You can see her clearly now,
can ’t you?
Yes.

22:19.506 --> 22:24.091
Okay So let’s sit here,
and we ’l/ 5le a little champagne.

22:24.177 --> 22:28.637
And you can describe her
to me in detail.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.965
[Casey]
She ’5 about 50.

22:32.060 --> 22:35.302
Oval face,
strong features,

22:35.396 --> 22:37.648
high cheekbones,
hazel eyes,

22:37.732 --> 22:40.018
pointed nose.

22:40.109 --> 22:43.351
[Zebra Vocalizing]

22:43.446 --> 22:46.688
Uh, dude,
you’re blocking my light.

22:46.783 --> 22:49.490
Do you, uh, recognize
this woman, Dr. Bailey?

22:49.577 --> 22:51.568
Of course I do.

22:53.289 --> 22:57.874
Mrs. Diane Annenberg.
She’s one ofour
biggest donors.

22:57.961 --> 23:01.078
We have a witness who saw
this woman arguing with
Dr. Welton the night ofthe benefit.

23:01.172 --> 23:05.006
A woman that generous
is used to getting her own way.
But she’s not a killer.

23:05.093 --> 23:07.800
She wouldn’t have been happy
knowing that your
best surgeon was disabled.

23:07.887 --> 23:11.630
Why didn ’t you mention
thatAndrew had syno vial
chondromatosis when we spoke?

23:11.724 --> 23:13.510
Because it didn’t affect
the investigation.

23:13.601 --> 23:16.559
lfyou think about it,
the hospital would’ve been
ruined ifit came out...

23:16.646 --> 23:20.138
that Dr. Welton
was operating when
he shouldn’t have been.

23:20.233 --> 23:22.144
Annenberg would’ve
looked like a fool.

23:22.235 --> 23:25.068
I know it’s been a while,
Camille.

23:25.154 --> 23:28.282
But you knew Andrew.
He would never
jeopardize a patient.

23:28.366 --> 23:31.233
We agreed he would only
supervise during surgery...

23:31.327 --> 23:34.740
until he decided
what sort oftreatment to follow.

23:34.831 --> 23:37.823
Was there any other reason
Annenberg might’ve
been angry with Andrew?

23:37.917 --> 23:41.409
She seems
a little old for him.

23:41.504 --> 23:44.337
Her son Rick is in
his last year of med school.

23:44.424 --> 23:46.380
He applied to Roosevelt
for his surgical residency

23:46.467 --> 23:48.958
- Andrew ran that
admissions committee.
- Did he reject her son?

23:49.053 --> 23:51.465
He did.
We supported that decision.

23:51.556 --> 23:54.548
l ooks like we have
one unhappy mom.

24:00.982 --> 24:04.019
So, you were seen
arguing with Dr. Welton
the night that he died.

24:04.110 --> 24:07.819
[Scoffs]
At the benefit?
That wasn’t an argument.

24:07.905 --> 24:09.691
Then what was it?

24:09.782 --> 24:12.990
l was expressing
my disappointment with
Dr. Welton’s decision...

24:13.077 --> 24:16.410
to exclude my son from
the residency program
at Roosevelt.

24:16.497 --> 24:18.283
Money doesn’t make you
a god, Mrs. Annenberg.

24:18.374 --> 24:21.241
My son
should’ve been accepted
because he’s deserving.

24:21.336 --> 24:24.453
Richard never wanted
to be anything
but a doctor.

24:24.547 --> 24:28.506
He worked for it.
He finished second
in his class.

24:28.593 --> 24:30.879
[Sighs]
Obviously,

24:30.970 --> 24:35.430
Dr. Welton had some sort
of personal issue
with my son or with me.

24:35.516 --> 24:37.802
Right. And removing him
would solve all your problems.

24:37.894 --> 24:39.509
Yes.

24:39.604 --> 24:42.971
I wanted him removed
from the
Board ofAdmissions.

24:43.066 --> 24:48.732
|-l do feel that
my generosity entitles me
to some sort of influence.

24:48.821 --> 24:54.236
But I did not want
Dr. Welton killed.

24:55.828 --> 24:59.696
Well, I can only imagine
that Richard was pretty angry
with Welton too.

24:59.791 --> 25:04.785
Ayoung man like that who’s used
to getting whatever he wants...
might lose control.

25:04.921 --> 25:07.378
Don’t be ridiculous.
Was your son at
the benefit that night?

25:08.591 --> 25:10.923
Richard is a good boy,
Agent Booth.

25:11.010 --> 25:13.922
Thank you for your time,
Mrs. Annenberg.

25:16.015 --> 25:18.882
[Saroyan]
Anything ofvalue yet?
We are cataloging injuries.

25:18.976 --> 25:20.352
I thought you would
be with Booth.

25:20.436 --> 25:22.347
Questioning people
isn’t really my thing.

25:22.438 --> 25:25.350
Most ofthe time, ljust
want to beat them until they
tell me what I want to hear.

25:25.441 --> 25:29.275
I know. It gets frustrating.
And hitting can often
be quite effective.

25:29.362 --> 25:31.227
And you both work with
thejustice Department?

25:31.322 --> 25:33.699
- Yes.
- Ironic.

25:33.783 --> 25:36.650
How is Michelle?

25:36.744 --> 25:38.735
The loss ofa father
can be quite devastating.

25:38.830 --> 25:41.412
I haven’t seen her again.

25:41.499 --> 25:43.911
I imagine Child Services...

25:44.001 --> 25:47.619
will probably be moving her
to a foster home soon.

25:50.299 --> 25:52.711
Those white flecks
that were embedded
in the pelvic bone,

25:52.802 --> 25:56.715
they’re polymerized hydrocarbon
from the serrated edge
ofa plastic knife.

25:56.806 --> 26:01.049
Seems our victim
was attacked in the groin
with disposable cutlery.

26:01.144 --> 26:03.806
Didn’t we find
a blood-soaked shoelace
in the remains?

26:03.896 --> 26:06.182
Yes. We assumed that
the tiger coughed it up.

26:06.274 --> 26:09.607
Under normal circumstances,
a plastic knife
could barely cut ﬂesh.

26:09.694 --> 26:13.937
But ifthere was already
an open wound caused by
whatever punctured the artery—

26:14.031 --> 26:17.865
Then a plastic knife
could be used to
enlarge the opening.

26:17.952 --> 26:21.820
- Why? Make him bleed out faster?
- No. Someone was trying
to make the bleeding stop.

26:21.914 --> 26:24.200
The puncture wounds were
too high fora tourniquet

26:24.292 --> 26:26.874
So they used the knife
to gain access
to the vascular area.

26:26.961 --> 26:30.829
The shoelace was probably used
to tie offthe femoral artery,
but the procedure failed.

26:30.923 --> 26:34.507
Who would attack him
and then try to save him?

26:34.594 --> 26:37.461
Someone with
a medical background.

26:40.558 --> 26:43.425
So, uh, tell me
about Dr. Welton.

26:43.519 --> 26:47.933
He was a... good man.
Good doctor.

26:48.065 --> 26:50.442
It’s terrible
what happened to him
I heard he made the mistake...

26:50.526 --> 26:54.610
of getting between
you and something you’ve been
working for your whole life.

26:54.697 --> 26:56.653
My mother tell you that?

26:56.741 --> 26:59.198
- She said you wanted
to be a doctor.
- She’s right.

26:59.285 --> 27:01.776
Roosevelt’s got some
ofthe best residencies.

27:01.871 --> 27:03.907
I could see why
you wouldn’t want anything
to get in your way.

27:03.998 --> 27:07.741
- What does that mean?
- Well, you see, the suspect
that we’re looking for...

27:07.835 --> 27:11.623
had motive, opportunity
and a medical background.

27:11.756 --> 27:16.341
Does that sound like
anyone in this room?
You think I killed Dr. Welton?

27:16.427 --> 27:19.715
I want to save lives,
Agent Booth.
That’s why I’m a doctor.

27:19.806 --> 27:22.138
Someone tried to save
Dr. Welton.

27:22.225 --> 27:24.307
They tried to stop the bleeding
after they attacked him.

27:24.393 --> 27:27.521
I didn’t even want
the residency. I begged
Dr. Welton to reject me.

27:27.605 --> 27:30.563
After all that hard work,
now why would you do
something like that?

27:32.527 --> 27:34.438
To get away
from my mother.

27:34.529 --> 27:37.066
She seems all benevolent,
but she’s a control freak.

27:37.156 --> 27:39.943
And Dr. Welton,
he understood that I had
to get away from her...

27:40.034 --> 27:41.945
to be
the kind of doctor
/ wanted to be.

27:42.036 --> 27:44.322
So he stood up for you,
even though he might lose hisjob?

27:44.413 --> 27:45.949
Yeah.

27:46.040 --> 27:47.655
[Chuckles]

27:47.750 --> 27:49.866
Look, you don’t have
to believe me.

27:49.961 --> 27:53.169
Ifsomebody tried to stop
the bleeding, then they’d be
covered in blood themselves.

27:53.256 --> 27:56.714
Take my clothes.
You can run all
the tests you want

28:01.764 --> 28:04.255
ljust wanted
to find out
how you were doing.

28:04.350 --> 28:06.807
/ know how difﬁcult
this must be for you.

28:06.894 --> 28:09.180
Aren’t you supposed
to be finding out
who did this to my dad?

28:09.272 --> 28:13.060
And I will.
I swearto you.

28:13.150 --> 28:18.895
I know what
a good man he was
and what a great father.

28:30.918 --> 28:32.499
You don’t remember?

28:34.755 --> 28:38.247
Yeah.
Yeah, I remember.

28:39.802 --> 28:42.794
I remember that you said you loved me...

28:42.889 --> 28:45.471
and that we were a family.

28:45.558 --> 28:48.140
And then youjust left.

28:48.227 --> 28:50.309
The reason I left—

28:52.565 --> 28:56.683
It was between your father and me.
It had nothing to do with you, Michelle.

28:56.777 --> 29:00.736
Yeah. That’s what he always said.

29:00.823 --> 29:06.113
But ifyou care so much,
why don’t you explain it to me right now?

29:09.206 --> 29:11.117
I don’t know.
If he didn’t talk to you
about it, I—

29:11.208 --> 29:14.951
I waited for you.

29:15.046 --> 29:17.162
I looked out the window for weeks...

29:17.256 --> 29:19.872
waiting on you to come home.

29:19.967 --> 29:23.209
You don’t say that you love somebody
and then just walk out like that.

29:25.806 --> 29:27.967
Yourfather and I
were gonna get married,
Michelle.

29:30.519 --> 29:34.057
But your father, he—

29:37.068 --> 29:38.979
What?

29:40.446 --> 29:42.858
He was still seeing
other women,

29:42.949 --> 29:44.860
even after
we were engaged.

29:44.951 --> 29:48.068
And I tried
to work through it.
I loved him.

29:48.162 --> 29:53.327
I still do.
But after your mother,

29:54.877 --> 29:58.290
I don’t think your father
could ever commit
like that again.

29:58.381 --> 30:02.670
And that wasn’t something
I could live with.

30:05.262 --> 30:09.881
Maybe because he knew
that you weren’t good enough.

30:12.228 --> 30:15.061
Maybe he was just waiting
for the right woman.

30:19.485 --> 30:21.396
Maybe.

30:22.822 --> 30:27.236
I’m— I’m sorry
I brought it up.

30:29.870 --> 30:33.954
I never stopped thinking about you,
Michelle. And ifthere’s anything I can—

30:34.041 --> 30:38.034
I don’t need anything from you.
Just go.

30:38.129 --> 30:40.120
Leave me alone.

30:41.340 --> 30:42.750
Go!

30:45.594 --> 30:48.301
[ Crying, Sniffling ]

31:01.569 --> 31:04.606
[Crying]

31:11.412 --> 31:13.869
So what did Michelle
say to you?

31:13.956 --> 31:18.245
She said that I wasn’t
good enough for her father,

31:18.335 --> 31:21.122
and that was why
he saw other women.

31:21.213 --> 31:23.329
- Welton cheated on you?
- That’s why I left.

31:23.424 --> 31:26.791
- Did that bother you?
- Sweetie, how many times
do l have to tell you...

31:26.886 --> 31:28.968
that most people
don’t like to be cheated on?

31:29.055 --> 31:31.421
The only people who don’t mind
havejust given up.

31:31.515 --> 31:33.847
Or are very,
very rational...

31:33.934 --> 31:38.052
and above
those archaic notions
of monogamy.

31:38.147 --> 31:41.230
Right. Yes, of course.
I’m not quite evolved enough.

31:41.317 --> 31:44.400
Excuse me.
This is not my area of expertise.

31:44.487 --> 31:48.355
But ifWelton cheated on you,
he may have been
cheating on other women.

31:48.449 --> 31:50.314
He probably was.

31:50.451 --> 31:52.783
The only person he was ever
faithful to was Michelle.
[Ange/a ] Well, there you go.

31:52.870 --> 31:55.612
He was playing the field,
and somebody probably
nuked him for it.

31:55.706 --> 31:59.619
- Well, how do you know?
- Because despite the fact
I would love to have my legs...

31:59.710 --> 32:02.702
wrapped around one
right now,
men are awful.

32:02.797 --> 32:05.209
Hey

32:05.299 --> 32:07.164
Whoa.

32:07.259 --> 32:09.466
- What’d I do?
- You’re a man.

32:09.553 --> 32:12.636
- I have information.
- Go ahead.

32:12.723 --> 32:17.387
Uric acid on the victim’s
clothing, it’s feline,
but it’s not tiger pee.

32:17.478 --> 32:20.595
Sediment composition
and pH level suggests
that it was from a lion.

32:20.689 --> 32:23.681
Are you aware that lionesses
do all the hunting?

32:23.776 --> 32:27.109
Yes. The males
simply copulate and eat
what the females catch.

32:27.196 --> 32:30.188
And when they get cranky,
they eat the cubs.

32:30.324 --> 32:32.235
[Saroyan ] Mm-hmm.
[A ngela ]
Men.

32:32.326 --> 32:35.159
Wow. Before I flee
for my life,

32:35.246 --> 32:38.864
the particles I found
in the wounds around
the femoral artery,

32:38.958 --> 32:41.119
the ones I thought
might be mica,
they’re scales.

32:41.210 --> 32:43.792
- Fish?
- No, snake.

32:43.879 --> 32:45.790
I can maybe have
a species by tomorrow.

32:45.881 --> 32:48.167
Hey. You wanna stay
and have a drink?

32:48.259 --> 32:52.753
Oh. Yeah.
We hate men.

32:52.847 --> 32:56.214
I’m gonna go now.

32:58.686 --> 33:01.268
He does ha ve
a terrific ass.

33:01.355 --> 33:04.722
Perhaps that’s why
you’re always making him leave.

33:04.817 --> 33:06.353
[Chuckles]

33:07.736 --> 33:09.818
[Brennan]
No lions?
None in the whole park.

33:09.905 --> 33:13.272
They’re tigers. How much
difference can there be between
lion urine and tiger urine?

33:13.367 --> 33:15.232
There are no stripes
in tiger urine.

33:15.369 --> 33:17.985
I didn’t say there are.
ljust know how much
you love cartoons.

33:18.080 --> 33:19.741
- Tom andJerry?
- Bugs and Daffy.

33:19.832 --> 33:24.451
All right. Now, this
is the capybara enclosure.

33:24.545 --> 33:26.376
Now, they use
crystallized lion urine...

33:26.463 --> 33:29.330
around the edges
ofthis enclosure to keep
the capybaras inside.

33:29.425 --> 33:31.962
And then, look at this.

33:32.052 --> 33:35.010
The reptile shed

33:35.139 --> 33:36.754
Snaked
[ChucMes]
[Gasps]

33:38.017 --> 33:40.508
What is that?

33:40.603 --> 33:42.514
[Hodgins]
it’s a snake hook.

33:42.605 --> 33:45.187
It’s used for picking them up
and keeping them
at a safe distance.

33:45.274 --> 33:47.606
That hook could’ve
severed the artery
and deposited...

33:47.693 --> 33:50.150
the snake scales
in the gouge in the femur.

33:50.237 --> 33:53.024
So he was killed
around that area with
something like that thing.

33:53.115 --> 33:56.107
- That is very imprecise.
- Works for me.

33:58.120 --> 34:01.612
- Ange/a.
- Clark. Hello.

34:01.707 --> 34:04.870
I would like you to meet
my romantic partner,
Dr. Nora Oldhouse.

34:04.960 --> 34:09.920
- Hello, romantic partner.
- Yes, we’re romantically
involved together— she and I.

34:10.007 --> 34:13.545
- Clark, she heard you.
- Nora, these are not like
regular people.

34:13.636 --> 34:15.922
It is best to be very,
very clear with them.

34:16.013 --> 34:20.006
Nora ’s a tenured professor
of women ’5 studies
at Georgetown, and a vegan.

34:20.100 --> 34:23.433
Could you be any more
politically correct
or cute?

34:23.520 --> 34:26.683
See? See what shejust
did there? I mean,
it’s harassment, baby. Hey.

34:26.774 --> 34:29.390
We’re in a monogamous
relationship. I need you
to back up off me, lady.

34:29.485 --> 34:32.522
I understand you’ve recently
decided to be celibate,
Miss Montenegro.

34:32.613 --> 34:34.899
Uh, temporarily,
yeah.

34:35.032 --> 34:37.318
That could have some
physiological repercussions.
Tell me about it

34:37.409 --> 34:39.240
But unbelievable
fantasies.

34:39.328 --> 34:41.660
Did you know that women
in the 79th century...

34:41.747 --> 34:44.204
would visit their physicians
for anxiety and hysteria?

34:44.291 --> 34:47.749
And as treatment, the doctor
would provide manual
sexual stimulation to the women.

34:47.878 --> 34:50.494
And a subsequent orgasm
would pro vide—
Oh, God! What are you doin’?

34:50.589 --> 34:52.705
I don’t think that
my insurance covers that.

34:52.800 --> 34:55.917
Well, I’mjust saying that
these women weren’t getting
what they needed at home.

34:56.011 --> 35:00.129
You understand?
In the absence ofa sex partner,
there are other alternatives.

35:00.224 --> 35:02.465
To me.
Alternatives to me.

35:02.559 --> 35:04.936
- Vibrators or sex toys—
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

35:05.020 --> 35:07.181
Why am I here for this?
I don’t need to be hearing this.
Excuse me.

35:07.314 --> 35:11.102
He’s very sweet.
I know.
It was nice to meet you.

35:11.193 --> 35:12.979
You too.
Thank you for the tip.

35:13.112 --> 35:16.445
Yea h.
Hey, Dr. Oldhouse.

35:16.532 --> 35:20.445
I wasn’t wrong
about Clark, was I?
He’s tightly wound, but—

35:20.536 --> 35:24.404
Dynamite, Miss Montenegro.
A briefcase bomb.

35:24.498 --> 35:26.864
That’s what I thought.

35:26.959 --> 35:28.950
Baby.

35:31.422 --> 35:34.710
When I was talking
with Ange and Brennan
last night about men,

35:34.800 --> 35:37.963
it occurred to me that Andrew
probably didn’t change much
when it came to women.

35:38.053 --> 35:40.920
Come on. It’s been 10 years.
Do you think Andrew was still
visiting the same place?

35:41.015 --> 35:42.926
Andrew was set
in his routines.

35:43.017 --> 35:45.178
And ifl remember
Langston correctly,
this guy didn’t miss a thing.

35:45.269 --> 35:47.931
Hiya, Langston.

35:48.022 --> 35:50.729
- I know you.
- It’s been a while.

35:50.816 --> 35:55.310
3-0-1.
Wednesday afternoons
with Dr. Welton.

35:55.404 --> 35:57.360
Noisy afternoons.
You always left smiling.

35:57.448 --> 35:59.655
- Hey.
- You were a nurse
at the hospital.

35:59.742 --> 36:02.529
She was a doctor, okay?
And now she ’s
a federal coroner.

36:02.619 --> 36:06.237
So a little respect,
okay, Rumpelstiltskin?

36:06.332 --> 36:10.245
- Coroner, huh? Somebody die?
- Yeah, Langston. Dr. Welton.

36:10.336 --> 36:14.875
Wow. My bet:
jealous husband.
Orjealous ex maybe.

36:15.007 --> 36:17.714
You’re wearing on me, sport.
[Clears Throat]

36:17.801 --> 36:20.087
I’m gonna guess that Andrew
kept coming to your motel after me.

36:20.179 --> 36:21.635
Uh, yeah.
He kept comin’.

36:21.722 --> 36:23.929
- With anyone special?
- I don’t know her name.

36:24.016 --> 36:27.053
- Describe her then.
- Good lookin’, like all ofyou.

36:27.144 --> 36:29.806
Uh, tall.
He liked ‘em tall.

36:29.897 --> 36:33.185
Pretty face.
Sharp features. And red hair.

36:33.275 --> 36:35.732
Red hair?

36:45.370 --> 36:47.235
- I have no idea what that is.
- That’s the murder weapon.

36:47.331 --> 36:51.540
The point ofthe hook
tapers in a manner identical
to the fatal wounds...

36:51.627 --> 36:54.243
we found on the head
ofthe femur
and the pelvic bone.

36:54.338 --> 36:56.249
Plus, the curved nature
ofthe weapon resulted in—

36:56.340 --> 36:58.080
What was that?
Cortical splintering.

36:58.175 --> 37:00.917
See, Dr. Brennan’s people
found that Dr. Welton
was struck with this...

37:01.053 --> 37:02.884
between two and—
Four times.

37:02.971 --> 37:06.759
- Fourtimes.
- And then stabbed with this
in the femoral artery.

37:06.850 --> 37:09.557
Would you be willing to
give us the clothes you wore
the night ofthe benefit?

37:09.645 --> 37:13.558
lfyou had
any evidence implicating me,
you’d have a warrant.

37:13.649 --> 37:17.062
- I believe I’ll decline.
- We know you had an affair
with Dr. Welton.

37:17.152 --> 37:19.484
Which means your husband
is a suspect. We’d have
to question him too.

37:19.571 --> 37:22.859
- Mm-hmm.
- I don’t appreciate your
veiled attempt at blackmail.

37:22.950 --> 37:25.066
Shethought
that was veiled?

37:25.160 --> 37:28.368
My position dictates
that any legal dealings
that concern me...

37:28.455 --> 37:30.320
have to go through
the hospital’s attorney.

37:30.457 --> 37:32.368
I’m sure you understand.
[Booth]
A/lright

37:32.459 --> 37:34.620
We got her
on the run, Bones.

37:43.011 --> 37:45.423
King ofthe lab.
Who cares?

37:45.514 --> 37:47.755
These are scales
from a snake.

37:47.850 --> 37:52.344
To be precise,
a Borga cyanea,
also known as a cat snake.

37:52.437 --> 37:55.224
Only problem is
there are no cat snakes
at the animal park.

37:58.360 --> 38:01.397
Why are you pretending
to be interested?
I am interested.

38:01.488 --> 38:03.900
You’rejust not used
to seeing this expression
on my face.

38:04.032 --> 38:07.695
Where’d the snake come from?
My guess, a wallet, shoes,
or a handbag.

38:07.786 --> 38:12.075
The victim’s wallet
was made of ostrich,
and his shoes were cow.

38:12.207 --> 38:15.540
I’m a vegan. These atrocities
register on me.
[Scoffs]

38:15.627 --> 38:18.039
I guess those scales
could’ve come from the murderer.

38:18.130 --> 38:20.462
I don’t know.
Maybe he was dressed
like a snake,

38:20.591 --> 38:24.709
which is biblically apropos.
And this makes you
king ofthe lab?

38:24.803 --> 38:28.295
Did you find anything
that might catch a killer?

38:28.432 --> 38:30.798
I found the
defensive wounds.
[Scoffs]

38:30.893 --> 38:33.350
Yesterday’s news, pal.

38:40.986 --> 38:42.897
[Brennan]
Hodgins found another way
to track the killer.

38:42.988 --> 38:47.402
Angela’s going through
all the digital photos
from the benefit now.

38:47.534 --> 38:50.367
You want to hear the details?
Not right now,
ifyou don’t mind.

38:54.583 --> 38:58.622
- What’s this?
- When I left Michelle
10 years ago,

38:58.712 --> 39:01.704
I knew Andrew wouldn’t say
what needed to be said, so—

39:01.798 --> 39:03.254
You did it?

39:03.342 --> 39:06.254
No. I didn’t know
what to say.

39:06.345 --> 39:10.338
And she was so little,
and I loved her so much.

39:10.432 --> 39:12.388
And I haven’t had a child
of my own,

39:12.476 --> 39:17.345
but I find it impossible
to believe anyone—

39:17.439 --> 39:19.430
anyone could love a child more.

39:22.444 --> 39:25.652
But I had no place
in her life anymore.

39:25.739 --> 39:28.196
So I had to—

39:28.283 --> 39:31.650
You had to leave room
in case Andrew
found someone else...

39:31.745 --> 39:35.112
who might help
raise Michelle.

39:35.207 --> 39:38.665
I had this old salt-and-pepper set
my grandmother gave me before she died.

39:38.752 --> 39:42.995
It fits together. I kept this one,
and I gave Michelle the other half.

39:43.090 --> 39:46.207
And I told herthat
whenever she looked at it,

39:46.301 --> 39:49.543
she should know that
at that exact moment,

39:49.638 --> 39:51.549
I’d be thinking of her and loving her.

39:51.682 --> 39:54.924
That is not strictly—
I know, Dr. Brennan.

39:55.018 --> 39:57.885
But I swear,
sometimes I looked at my half,

39:57.980 --> 40:01.268
and I knew that little girl
was missing me.

40:02.734 --> 40:04.725
Perhaps you should
take her in now.

40:04.820 --> 40:06.776
[Chuckles]
What?

40:06.863 --> 40:10.651
She’s an orphan.
She’s alone in the world.

40:10.742 --> 40:13.404
She needs a parent.

40:13.495 --> 40:15.827
Michelle stopped loving me
years ago.

40:15.914 --> 40:18.576
But you never stopped
loving her.

40:18.667 --> 40:23.457
She’ll know that.
The Mohawk Indians
have a saying...

40:23.547 --> 40:27.256
that when a child falls in the rapids,
the one who rescues her...

40:27.342 --> 40:29.674
will share in her new life forever.

40:29.761 --> 40:35.222
I assume that doesn’t only apply
to a potential drowning victim.

40:36.643 --> 40:40.386
I have to go help Angela
find a snake.

40:46.403 --> 40:48.485
[Brennan]
Hodgins says the scales
from the wound.

40:48.572 --> 40:50.904
didn ’t come
from any snakes at the park.

40:50.991 --> 40:54.279
[A ngela ]
S 0 we should look for
bloody clothing or a snakeskin.

40:54.369 --> 40:58.328
Dr. Bailey is here,
but she ’s wearing
this white dress.

40:58.415 --> 41:02.124
That’s late in the evening.
Ifshe’d have been the killer,
it would be covered in blood.

41:08.717 --> 41:11.083
[Ange/a ] Oh, boy
[Brennan]
A snakeskin handbag.

41:11.178 --> 41:13.760
Can you magnify that more?

41:15.307 --> 41:18.049
[A ngela ]
That is deﬁnitely torn.
Could be from the murder weapon.

41:18.143 --> 41:20.759
Can you pull back
to see the person?

41:24.274 --> 41:26.185
[Angela]
/t’s Nancy tauder.
The nurse.

41:26.276 --> 41:28.858
Well, her dress is black
It wou/dn ’t have shown blood

41:43.627 --> 41:46.664
We have a warrant
for the snakeskin handbag...

41:46.755 --> 41:48.791
and the dress you wore
to the fund-raiser that night.

41:54.763 --> 41:58.051
I burned the dress.
I was covered in blood.

41:58.141 --> 42:01.429
I’m placing you under arrest
for the murder
of Dr. Andrew Welton.

42:01.520 --> 42:03.226
I thought he’d change.

42:03.313 --> 42:06.430
You knew Dr. Welton was having
an affair with Dr. Bailey.

42:06.525 --> 42:08.937
All those years,
I was always there for him.

42:09.027 --> 42:10.938
Ifanyone knows how I felt,
it’s you.

42:11.029 --> 42:15.113
No, Nancy.
We’re not the same.
I left Andrew.

42:29.464 --> 42:31.500
Why did she kill my father?

42:35.178 --> 42:37.260
Yeah, I got it.

42:37.347 --> 42:41.556
Your father was
a good man, Michelle.

42:41.643 --> 42:45.886
I still carry him with me.
And he loved you.

42:45.981 --> 42:49.314
We were both
very lucky.

42:50.569 --> 42:53.276
I miss him so much.

42:56.700 --> 42:58.736
I want you to
consider something.

42:58.869 --> 43:01.736
You need a place
to live now.
Yeah.

43:01.830 --> 43:06.699
Um, my dad has some kind
of cousin in Chicago.

43:08.587 --> 43:13.707
I would like you
to come live with me.

43:36.072 --> 43:38.063
[Clears Throat]

43:47.459 --> 43:49.370
Where are you going?

43:51.087 --> 43:53.078
Ithought—

44:26.665 --> 44:30.283
I don’t know where Cam
gets the idea where she can
take in a 16-year-old girl.

44:30.418 --> 44:32.579
You don’t think
she can do it?
No. She can do it.

44:32.671 --> 44:36.163
It’sjust—Just because
somebody thinks that
they can do something...

44:36.258 --> 44:38.169
doesn’t mean
that they should.

44:38.260 --> 44:41.297
- Well, I told her I thought
it would be a good idea.
- Wow. Why?

44:41.388 --> 44:44.926
Well, she told me a story
about a salt shaker...

44:45.016 --> 44:47.348
that affected me
emotionally.

44:47.435 --> 44:49.926
ljust can’t believe
Cam would do that.
She’s a lot like you, you know.

44:50.063 --> 44:51.724
What do you mean?
Well, you know

44:51.815 --> 44:54.557
Shesindependent
likes to be alone.

44:54.651 --> 44:56.858
You know, free of
personal encumbrances.

44:56.945 --> 44:58.856
I’m not free of
personal encumbrances.

44:58.947 --> 45:02.439
Look, you don’t have
real responsibilities in life
until you have a child.

45:02.576 --> 45:05.158
Believe me.
Are you suggesting that...

45:05.245 --> 45:08.112
I’m not a fully engaged
human being because
I don’t have a child?

45:08.206 --> 45:09.707
No.

45:09.791 --> 45:12.157
|_
[Chuckles]
Good for Cam.

45:12.252 --> 45:14.368
So I gave her
good advice.

45:14.462 --> 45:17.625
Yes, Bones.
You gave her great advice.

45:17.716 --> 45:20.207
So, um,
where are the ribs?

45:20.302 --> 45:22.338
Oh, I got
moo shu tofu instead.

45:22.429 --> 45:25.671
Instead of ribs?
We solved the case,
you know?

45:25.765 --> 45:28.472
We’re supposed to be
celebrating. People
don’t celebrate with tofu.

45:28.560 --> 45:31.472
Independent women free of
personal encumbrances do.

45:31.563 --> 45:33.770
All right. You know what?
That was low.
That was really low.

45:33.898 --> 45:36.514
Come on. Try it.
No. Mm-mmm.

45:36.610 --> 45:38.771
Booth, come on.

45:40.864 --> 45:42.479
[Mumbles]

45:45.660 --> 45:48.823
Hmm. You know,
it’s like eating a sponge.

45:50.081 --> 45:53.744
I mean, for tofu,
it’s tofu.

45:53.835 --> 45:57.293
It’s— It’s spongy,
but it’s not actually not too bad.

45:57.422 --> 46:00.289
You want more?
So— Yeah. It’s not too bad.
I mean, I’ll try that.

46:35.502 --> 46:36.867
What’s that mean?
