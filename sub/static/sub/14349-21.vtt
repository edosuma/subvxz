00:03.426 --> 00:06.953
Captain's Log,
Stardate 2947.3.

00:07.030 --> 00:09.965
We have been through
a severe ion storm.

00:10.033 --> 00:12.263
One crewman is dead.

00:12.335 --> 00:14.360
The ship's damage
is considerable.

00:14.437 --> 00:16.370
I've ordered
a non scheduled layover

00:16.439 --> 00:19.203
on Starbase 11
for repairs.

00:19.276 --> 00:21.710
A full report of damages
was made

00:21.778 --> 00:25.874
to the commanding officer
of Starbase 11-- Commodore Stone.

00:28.451 --> 00:31.477
Maintenance,
Section 18.

00:31.555 --> 00:33.887
The section is working
on the Intrepid.

00:33.957 --> 00:36.482
Reschedule.
The Enterprise is on Priority 1 .

00:38.795 --> 00:41.559
That makes three times
you've read it,Jim.

00:41.631 --> 00:43.189
Is there an error?

00:43.266 --> 00:44.494
No.

00:46.102 --> 00:48.502
But the death
of the crewman...

00:48.572 --> 00:49.971
Regulations, Captain.

00:53.476 --> 00:56.240
And the extract from
your ship's computer log

00:56.313 --> 00:58.042
confirming this
sworn deposition?

00:58.114 --> 00:59.547
Kirk to Enterprise.

00:59.616 --> 01:01.140
[Uhura]
Bridge here.

01:01.218 --> 01:03.482
Where's Mr. Spock with
that computer log extract?

01:03.553 --> 01:06.317
He should have been there
10 minutes ago, sir.

01:06.389 --> 01:07.413
Kirk out.

01:07.490 --> 01:09.549
It's a great pity.
The service can't afford

01:09.626 --> 01:10.957
to lose men like
Lieutenant Commander Finney.

01:11.027 --> 01:11.994
I agree.

01:12.062 --> 01:14.462
I waited until
the last possible moment.

01:14.531 --> 01:17.193
We were on red alert,
the storm got worse.

01:17.267 --> 01:19.701
I had to jettison
the pod.

01:27.277 --> 01:29.438
What took so long,
Mr. Spock?

01:29.512 --> 01:31.446
Captain,

01:31.514 --> 01:32.446
I believe I--

01:32.515 --> 01:33.948
I'll take that.

01:41.291 --> 01:42.223
Jame.

01:42.292 --> 01:43.725
There you are.

01:43.793 --> 01:47.524
I just wanted one more look at you--
the man who killed my father.

01:47.597 --> 01:50.395
- That's not so. He was my friend.
- Your friend?

01:50.467 --> 01:52.901
You hated him
all your life!

01:52.969 --> 01:55.233
That's why you killed him,
you murderer!

01:55.305 --> 01:57.899
You murderer!
You murderer!

01:59.476 --> 02:00.408
Jame--

02:04.981 --> 02:06.676
Mr. Spock,

02:06.750 --> 02:08.342
would you please--

02:08.418 --> 02:10.852
Miss Finney,
come with me, please.

02:16.259 --> 02:17.749
Captain Kirk,

02:17.827 --> 02:20.421
you say you jettisoned the pod
after the red alert?

02:20.497 --> 02:21.964
You have
my sworn deposition.

02:22.032 --> 02:23.863
Then, Captain,
I must presume

02:23.933 --> 02:26.458
you've committed
willful perjury.

02:26.536 --> 02:29.198
This extract from your computer log
says you jettisoned the pod

02:29.272 --> 02:31.604
before going
to red alert.

02:31.675 --> 02:33.302
Consider yourself
confined to the base.

02:33.376 --> 02:34.707
Official inquiry
will determine

02:34.778 --> 02:37.212
whether a general court-martial
is in order.

02:44.788 --> 02:48.554
Space-- the final frontier.

02:48.625 --> 02:52.561
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

02:52.629 --> 02:54.290
Its five-year mission--

02:54.364 --> 02:57.822
to explores trange
new worlds...

02:57.901 --> 03:01.029
to seek out new life
and new civilizations...

03:01.104 --> 03:05.040
to boldly go
where no man has gone before.

Captain's Log,
Stardate 2948.5.

03:42.379 --> 03:45.815
Starship Enterprise remains
in orbit around Starbase 11.

03:45.882 --> 03:47.975
Full repair
is in progress.

03:48.051 --> 03:50.986
I've been ordered
to standbyon Starbase 11

03:51.054 --> 03:53.989
until the inquirinto the death
of Lieutenant Commander Finney

03:54.057 --> 03:55.319
can be conducted.

03:55.392 --> 03:57.326
I'm confident
of the outcome.

03:57.394 --> 03:59.328
Timothy,
I haven't seen you

03:59.396 --> 04:01.159
since the Vulcanian
expedition.

04:03.166 --> 04:06.602
Well, I see our graduating class
from the academy

04:06.669 --> 04:08.603
is well represented.

04:08.671 --> 04:11.003
Argan, Heller.

04:12.075 --> 04:13.736
How you doing, Mike?

04:13.810 --> 04:15.710
I'll get by,Jim.

04:15.779 --> 04:18.748
I understand you're laying over
for repairs.

04:18.815 --> 04:19.747
Big job?

04:19.815 --> 04:21.511
Couple of days.

04:21.584 --> 04:23.211
You moving out then?

04:23.286 --> 04:27.222
- In a hurry to see me go?
- I just wondered how long it'd take

04:27.290 --> 04:29.383
to get a new
records officer.

04:29.459 --> 04:31.017
You can talk
plainer than that.

04:31.094 --> 04:32.061
I can,

04:32.128 --> 04:35.063
but I think
the point's been made.

04:35.131 --> 04:36.689
Ben was a friend of ours.

04:36.766 --> 04:37.698
Jim, let's--

04:37.767 --> 04:40.065
Go on. Finish.

04:40.136 --> 04:43.902
Ben was a friend
of yours, and--

04:43.973 --> 04:45.406
Jim.

04:45.475 --> 04:46.407
Go on.

04:46.476 --> 04:48.944
I'm waiting
to hear the rest.

04:49.012 --> 04:51.242
Why don't
you tell us?

04:52.315 --> 04:55.250
What would be the point?

04:55.318 --> 04:58.048
You've already
made up your minds.

05:02.258 --> 05:03.657
Excuse me, Bones.

05:14.604 --> 05:16.367
If you have any doubt,

05:16.439 --> 05:19.374
that was indeed Captain James Kirk
of the Enterprise.

05:19.442 --> 05:22.309
Yes, I know.
Are you a friend of his?

05:22.378 --> 05:25.836
In these trying times,
one of the few.

05:25.915 --> 05:28.179
Dr. Leonard McCoy.
And you?

05:28.251 --> 05:31.049
Areel Shaw.
And I'm a friend, too--

05:31.120 --> 05:32.587
an old one.

05:32.655 --> 05:35.715
All of my old friends
look like doctors.

05:35.792 --> 05:38.226
All of his look
like you.

05:38.294 --> 05:40.057
Well, you might as well
join me for a drink.

05:40.129 --> 05:41.721
With this inquiry
coming up,

05:41.798 --> 05:45.859
he's going to need
all the friends he can get.

05:46.002 --> 05:46.900
[Click]

05:48.838 --> 05:50.396
Recording inquir.

05:50.473 --> 05:52.566
Matter-- Captain Kirk,
James T.

05:52.642 --> 05:54.075
Subject--
circumstances of death,

05:54.143 --> 05:57.237
Lieutenant Commander Finney,
Benjamin.

05:57.313 --> 06:00.407
This inquiry to determine
whether a general court-martial

06:00.483 --> 06:02.849
should be convened
against Captain Kirk

06:02.919 --> 06:07.686
on charges of perjury
and culpable negligence.

06:07.757 --> 06:09.349
Ready.

06:09.425 --> 06:11.859
Let us begin
with your relationship

06:11.928 --> 06:13.725
with Commander Finney.

06:13.796 --> 06:16.162
You knew him for
a long time, didn't you?

06:16.232 --> 06:18.700
Yes.
He was an instructor at the academy

06:18.768 --> 06:20.235
when I was a midshipman.

06:20.303 --> 06:23.067
But that didn't stand in the way
of our beginning a close friendship.

06:23.139 --> 06:26.074
His daughter Jame, who was here
last night, was named after me.

06:26.142 --> 06:28.975
It's common knowledge that
something happened to your friendship.

06:29.045 --> 06:30.239
It's no secret.

06:30.313 --> 06:33.714
We were assigned to the same ship
some years later.

06:33.783 --> 06:35.546
I relieved him
on watch once

06:35.618 --> 06:39.054
and found a circuit open to the atomic
matter piles that should've been closed.

06:39.122 --> 06:40.555
Another five minutes,

06:40.623 --> 06:42.420
it could have
blown up the ship.

06:42.492 --> 06:45.723
Ship nomenclature--
specify.

06:45.795 --> 06:49.731
United Starship Republic,
number 1371 .

06:49.799 --> 06:51.391
Continue.

06:51.467 --> 06:53.401
I closed the switch

06:53.469 --> 06:55.562
and logged the incident.

06:55.638 --> 06:57.071
He drew a reprimand

06:57.140 --> 06:59.768
and was sent to the bottom
of the promotion list.

06:59.842 --> 07:01.400
And he blamed you for that?

07:01.477 --> 07:02.501
Yes.

07:02.579 --> 07:04.342
He'd been at the academy

07:04.414 --> 07:07.383
for an unusually long time
as an instructor.

07:07.450 --> 07:09.350
As a result,
he was late

07:09.419 --> 07:11.080
in being assigned
to a starship.

07:11.154 --> 07:13.122
The delay, he felt,
looked bad on his record.

07:13.189 --> 07:15.123
My action, he believed,
made things worse.

07:15.191 --> 07:16.283
Comment--

07:16.359 --> 07:18.350
service record of Lieutenant
Commander Finney

07:18.428 --> 07:20.191
to be appended
this inquiry.

07:20.263 --> 07:21.560
Noted.

07:21.631 --> 07:25.362
Now, let's get into the specifics
of the storm, Captain.

07:25.435 --> 07:29.098
Weather scan indicated
an ion storm dead ahead.

07:29.172 --> 07:30.969
I sent Finney
into the pod.

07:31.040 --> 07:32.200
Why Finney?

07:32.275 --> 07:33.606
His name was at the top
of the duty roster.

07:33.676 --> 07:35.166
- If he blamed you--
- He may have blamed me

07:35.244 --> 07:37.041
that he never rose to command a ship,
but I don't assign jobs

07:37.113 --> 07:38.876
on the basis
of who blames me.

07:38.948 --> 07:41.883
It was Finney's turn,
and I assigned him.

07:41.951 --> 07:45.546
He had just checked in
with me from the pod

07:45.622 --> 07:48.887
when we hit the leading edge
of the storm.

07:48.958 --> 07:50.892
Not too bad at first.

07:50.960 --> 07:52.894
I signaled
a yellow alert.

07:52.962 --> 07:55.396
Then we began
encountering pressure,

07:55.465 --> 07:57.899
variant stress,
force 7, the works.

07:57.967 --> 08:01.403
I finally signaled
a red alert.

08:01.471 --> 08:04.599
Finney knew he had
a matter of seconds.

08:05.908 --> 08:10.174
I gave him
those seconds and more.

08:10.246 --> 08:11.679
But...

08:11.748 --> 08:13.739
apparently
it wasn't enough.

08:14.917 --> 08:17.351
Then why, Captain, does
the computer log from your ship,

08:17.420 --> 08:19.183
made automatically
at the time,

08:19.255 --> 08:22.850
indicate that you were still
on yellow alert when you jettisoned

08:22.925 --> 08:24.517
and not on red?

08:24.594 --> 08:25.993
I don't know.

08:27.964 --> 08:30.364
- There's been a mistake.
- It would seem so.

08:30.433 --> 08:32.196
Could the computer
be wrong?

08:32.268 --> 08:34.793
Mr. Spock is running
a survey right now,

08:34.871 --> 08:37.863
but the odds are
next to impossible.

08:37.940 --> 08:39.373
Stop recording.

08:41.477 --> 08:43.206
Now, look,Jim.

08:45.948 --> 08:48.041
Not one man
in a million

08:48.117 --> 08:51.382
could do what you and I have done--
command a starship.

08:51.454 --> 08:53.547
A hundred
decisions a day,

08:53.623 --> 08:57.821
hundreds of lives staked on you
making every one of them right.

08:57.894 --> 08:59.384
You're played out,Jim.

08:59.462 --> 09:01.953
- Exhausted.
- Is that the way you see it?

09:02.031 --> 09:03.999
That's the way my report'll read
ifyou cooperate.

09:04.067 --> 09:07.161
Physical breakdown,
possibly even mental collapse?

09:07.236 --> 09:09.670
- Possibly.
- I'd be admitting that a man died--

09:09.739 --> 09:12.333
Admit nothing.
Say nothing.

09:12.408 --> 09:14.342
Let me bury
the matter here and now.

09:14.410 --> 09:16.344
No starship captain
has ever stood trial before,

09:16.412 --> 09:18.073
and I don't want you
to be the first.

09:18.147 --> 09:20.707
But if what you suspect is true,
then I should be punished.

09:20.783 --> 09:24.583
I'm thinking of the service.
I won't have it smeared.

09:24.654 --> 09:27.020
By what, Commodore Stone?

09:28.691 --> 09:33.390
All right. By an evident perjurer
who's either covering his bad judgment,

09:33.463 --> 09:34.521
his cowardice, or--

09:34.597 --> 09:36.861
That's as far
as you go, sir.

09:36.933 --> 09:39.367
I'm telling you
I was there on the bridge.

09:39.435 --> 09:41.027
I know what happened.
I know what I did.

09:41.104 --> 09:42.401
It's in the transcript,

09:42.472 --> 09:44.463
and computer transcripts
don't lie.

09:44.540 --> 09:45.802
I'm telling you,
Captain,

09:45.875 --> 09:48.867
either you accept
a permanent ground assignment,

09:48.945 --> 09:51.880
or the whole disciplinary weight
of Starfleet command

09:51.948 --> 09:54.382
is gonna light
right on your neck.

09:54.450 --> 09:57.214
So that's the way we do it now? Sweep it
under the rug, and me along with it?

09:57.286 --> 10:00.084
Not on your life.
I intend to fight.

10:00.156 --> 10:02.090
Then you draw a general court.

10:02.158 --> 10:05.719
Draw it? I demand it. And right now,
Commodore Stone. Right now.

10:16.506 --> 10:19.873
Captain's Log,
Stardate 2948.9.

10:19.942 --> 10:22.137
The officers who will comprise
my court-martial board

10:22.211 --> 10:24.406
are proceeding
to Starbase 11.

10:24.480 --> 10:27.938
Meanwhile, repairs on the Enterprise
are almost complete.

10:34.357 --> 10:35.619
Areel.

10:40.029 --> 10:42.293
Dr. McCoy said
you were here.

10:42.365 --> 10:46.131
I should have felt it in the air
like static electricity.

10:46.202 --> 10:48.227
Flattery will
get you everywhere.

10:54.544 --> 10:56.978
It's been--

10:57.046 --> 10:58.980
How long has it been?

10:59.048 --> 11:02.484
Fouryears, seven months,
and an odd number of days--

11:02.552 --> 11:03.814
not that
I'm counting.

11:03.886 --> 11:06.354
You look marvelous.
You haven't changed a bit.

11:06.422 --> 11:09.152
But things have changed
foryou, haven't they?

11:09.225 --> 11:11.819
Oh, you've heard
about that, have you?

11:11.894 --> 11:15.159
I'm a lawyer in
thejudge advocate's office, remember?

11:15.231 --> 11:16.163
I remember.

11:16.232 --> 11:17.529
Let's forget it.

11:17.600 --> 11:21.263
We have a lot of lost time
to make up for.

11:21.337 --> 11:23.100
You're taking it
very lightly.

11:23.172 --> 11:25.436
- The confidence of an innocent man.
- Are you?

11:25.508 --> 11:26.440
Mm-hmm.

11:26.509 --> 11:28.773
That's not what
the rumors indicate.

11:28.845 --> 11:29.937
Look,

11:30.012 --> 11:32.276
Let's not talk shop.

11:32.348 --> 11:36.114
Jim, this could ruin you.
Will you take some advice?

11:36.185 --> 11:39.177
I never could
talkyou into anything.

11:41.524 --> 11:42.889
All right. Fire away.

11:44.026 --> 11:46.290
The prosecution
will build its case

11:46.362 --> 11:49.126
on the basis of Kirk
versus the computer.

11:49.198 --> 11:51.962
Now, if your attorney tries
to defend on that basis,

11:52.034 --> 11:53.797
you won't have
a chance.

11:53.870 --> 11:56.964
- Well, what other choice is there?
- That's up to your attorney,

11:57.039 --> 11:59.473
and that's why
he's got to be a good one.

11:59.542 --> 12:00.474
You, perhaps?

12:00.543 --> 12:02.135
No. I--

12:02.211 --> 12:03.439
I'm busy.

12:03.512 --> 12:04.774
Well,

12:04.847 --> 12:08.248
a girl with your ability should
be able to handle two cases at once.

12:08.317 --> 12:09.750
Jim, be serious.

12:09.819 --> 12:11.753
You're not
an ordinary human.

12:11.821 --> 12:13.254
You're a Starship captain,

12:13.322 --> 12:15.256
and you've stepped
into scandal.

12:15.324 --> 12:17.417
If there's any way
they can do it,

12:17.493 --> 12:19.927
they'll slap you down hard
and permanently

12:19.996 --> 12:22.590
for the good
of the service.

12:22.665 --> 12:24.929
You still haven't made
any recommendation.

12:25.001 --> 12:27.435
Samuel T. Cogley,
attorney-at-law.

12:27.503 --> 12:30.267
If anyone can
save you, he can.

12:30.339 --> 12:33.103
He'll be paying you
a visit.

12:33.175 --> 12:34.437
Jim, I've got to go.

12:34.510 --> 12:36.501
Areel.

12:36.579 --> 12:39.446
You still haven't told me
how you know so much

12:39.515 --> 12:42.951
about what the prosecution's
going to do.

12:43.019 --> 12:47.786
Because,Jim Kirk,
my dear old love,

12:47.857 --> 12:50.121
I am the prosecution,

12:50.192 --> 12:55.289
and I have to do my very best
to have you slapped down hard,

12:55.364 --> 12:57.298
broken
out of the service...

12:58.367 --> 12:59.629
in disgrace.

13:17.820 --> 13:18.787
You Kirk?

13:20.156 --> 13:21.248
Yes.

13:24.327 --> 13:25.589
What is all this?

13:25.661 --> 13:28.425
I figure we'll be spending some time
together, so I moved in.

13:28.497 --> 13:30.590
I hope I'm not
crowding you.

13:30.666 --> 13:32.327
What's the matter?
Don't you like books?

13:32.401 --> 13:35.632
Oh, I like them fine,
but a computer takes less space.

13:35.705 --> 13:37.263
[Scoffs]
A computer, huh?

13:37.340 --> 13:39.934
I got one of these
in my office.

13:40.009 --> 13:41.772
Contains
all the precedents,

13:41.844 --> 13:47.043
a synthesis of all the great
legal decisions written throughout time.

13:47.116 --> 13:49.516
- I never use it.
- Why not?

13:49.585 --> 13:51.280
I've got my own system.

13:51.354 --> 13:53.948
Books, young man, books.
Thousands of them.

13:54.023 --> 13:57.288
Iftime wasn't so important,
I'd show you something-- my library.

13:57.360 --> 13:58.793
Thousands of books.

13:58.861 --> 14:01.421
- What would be the point?
- This is where the law is,

14:01.497 --> 14:04.898
not in that homogenized,
pasteurized, synthesized--

14:04.967 --> 14:06.730
Do you want to know the law,

14:06.802 --> 14:09.066
the ancient concepts
in their own language,

14:09.138 --> 14:12.073
Learn the intent of the men
who wrote them,

14:12.141 --> 14:15.736
from Moses
to the tribunal of Alpha 3?

14:15.811 --> 14:18.075
Books.

14:18.147 --> 14:21.583
You have to be either an obsessive
crackpot who's escaped from his keeper

14:21.650 --> 14:24.084
or Samuel T. Cogley,
attorney-at-law.

14:24.153 --> 14:25.586
Right on both counts.

14:25.654 --> 14:28.214
- Need a lawyer?
- I'm afraid so.

14:35.331 --> 14:37.765
This court is now
in session.

14:42.004 --> 14:44.939
I've appointed
as members of this court

14:45.007 --> 14:48.272
Space Command
Representative Lindstrom,

14:48.344 --> 14:51.108
Starship Captain Krasnovsky,

14:51.180 --> 14:52.374
and Chondra.

14:54.183 --> 14:55.810
Captain Kirk,

14:55.885 --> 14:57.443
I direct your attention
to the fact

14:57.520 --> 15:00.045
that you have a right to ask
for substitute officers

15:00.122 --> 15:01.589
if you feel that any
of these named

15:01.657 --> 15:03.750
harbor any prejudiced attitudes
to your case.

15:03.826 --> 15:05.453
I have no
objections, sir.

15:05.528 --> 15:08.088
Do you consent to the service
Lieutenant Shaw

15:08.164 --> 15:10.064
as prosecuting officer

15:10.132 --> 15:13.898
and to myself
as president of the court?

15:13.969 --> 15:15.266
I do, sir.

15:15.337 --> 15:16.770
All right, clerk.

15:19.975 --> 15:22.500
Charge--
culpable negligence.

15:22.578 --> 15:27.743
Specification--
in that on Stardate 2945.7,

15:27.817 --> 15:29.079
by such negligence,

15:29.151 --> 15:30.584
Captain Kirk,James T.,

15:30.653 --> 15:32.587
did cause loss of life--

15:32.655 --> 15:34.919
to wit, the life
of Records Officer

15:34.990 --> 15:37.185
Lieutenant Commander
Finney, Benjamin.

15:37.259 --> 15:39.591
To all recorded charges
and specifications,

15:39.662 --> 15:41.027
what is the plea?

15:45.801 --> 15:47.132
Not guilty.

15:54.243 --> 15:55.232
Proceed, Lieutenant.

15:57.213 --> 15:59.272
I call Mr. Spock.

16:12.294 --> 16:18.494
Spock, serial number
S-179-276-SP.

16:18.567 --> 16:20.398
Service rank--
Lieutenant Commander.

16:20.469 --> 16:24.462
Position-- first officer,
science officer.

16:24.540 --> 16:27.998
Current assignment--
U.S.S. Enterprise.

16:28.077 --> 16:31.638
Commendations-- Vulcanian
Scientific Legion of Honor.

16:31.714 --> 16:33.682
Awards of valor--

16:33.749 --> 16:36.582
twice decorated
by Starfleet command.

16:36.652 --> 16:39.348
Mr. Spock,
as a first officer, you know

16:39.421 --> 16:41.753
a great deal
about computers, don't you?

16:41.824 --> 16:43.416
I know all about them.

16:43.492 --> 16:46.154
It is possible for a computer
to malfunction, is it not?

16:46.228 --> 16:48.594
- Affirmative.
- Do you know of any malfunction

16:48.664 --> 16:51.929
which has caused an inaccuracy
in the Enterprise computer?

16:52.001 --> 16:52.933
Negative.

16:53.002 --> 16:55.436
That answer is based
on your mechanical survey

16:55.504 --> 16:56.937
of the Enterprise computer

16:57.006 --> 17:00.100
ordered by the defendant
prior to this trial, is it not?

17:00.176 --> 17:02.269
- Affirmative.
- Now the stardate--

17:02.344 --> 17:05.211
But the computer
is inaccurate, never the less.

17:05.281 --> 17:06.942
Why do you say that?

17:07.016 --> 17:09.382
It reports that
the jettison button

17:09.451 --> 17:11.714
was pressed before
the red alert.

17:11.787 --> 17:14.050
In other words, it reports
that Captain Kirk

17:14.123 --> 17:15.920
was reacting to
an extreme emergency

17:15.991 --> 17:17.788
that did not then exist.

17:17.859 --> 17:21.125
- And that is impossible.
- Is it?

17:21.196 --> 17:24.394
Were you watching him the exact moment
he pressed the jettison button?

17:24.465 --> 17:28.698
No. I was occupied.
The ship was already on yellow alert.

17:28.771 --> 17:32.207
Then how can you dispute
the finding of the log?

17:32.274 --> 17:34.742
I do not dispute it.

17:34.810 --> 17:36.710
I merely state
that it is wrong.

17:36.779 --> 17:39.543
Oh? On what do you
base that statement?

17:39.615 --> 17:41.981
I know the captain.
He is in--

17:42.051 --> 17:44.349
Please instruct the witness
not to speculate.

17:44.420 --> 17:47.753
Lieutenant,
I am half Vulcanian.

17:47.823 --> 17:49.415
Vulcanians do not speculate.

17:49.491 --> 17:52.426
I speak from pure logic.

17:52.494 --> 17:54.189
If I let go of a hammer

17:54.263 --> 17:56.288
on a planet
that has a positive gravity,

17:56.365 --> 18:00.233
I need not see it fall to know
that it has, in fact, fallen.

18:00.302 --> 18:02.930
- I do not see what that has to--
- Gentlemen,

18:03.005 --> 18:05.405
human beings have characteristics

18:05.474 --> 18:07.908
just as inanimate objects do.

18:07.977 --> 18:10.377
It is impossible
for Captain Kirk

18:10.446 --> 18:13.882
to act out of panic or malice.

18:13.949 --> 18:16.747
- It is not his nature.
- In your opinion.

18:19.888 --> 18:22.789
Yes. In my opinion.

18:22.858 --> 18:24.382
Thank you.

18:24.460 --> 18:27.520
- Your witness, Mr. Cogley.
- No questions.

18:27.596 --> 18:29.291
You may step down.

18:33.369 --> 18:36.463
I now call the personnel officer
for the Enterprise.

18:37.940 --> 18:39.805
Service rank-- ensign.

18:39.875 --> 18:42.036
Position--
personnel officer.

18:42.111 --> 18:45.342
Current assignment--
U.S.S. Enterprise.

18:45.414 --> 18:48.975
In the course of your duties as
personnel officer of the Enterprise,

18:49.051 --> 18:52.020
you would be familiar with
the service records of all aboard?

18:52.087 --> 18:53.179
Yes, ma'am.

18:53.255 --> 18:56.315
With reference to
Records Officer Finney,

18:56.392 --> 18:58.223
was there in his service record

18:58.294 --> 19:02.060
a reported disciplinary action
for failure to close a circuit?

19:02.131 --> 19:03.063
Yes, ma'am.

19:03.132 --> 19:06.260
Was the charge in that instance
based upon a log entry

19:06.335 --> 19:08.166
by the officer
who relieved him?

19:08.237 --> 19:10.831
- Yes, ma'am.
- And who was that officer?

19:12.908 --> 19:14.933
Ensign James T. Kirk.

19:15.010 --> 19:16.568
Louder, please,
for the court.

19:16.645 --> 19:19.671
Ensign James T. Kirk.

19:19.748 --> 19:23.013
Now the Captain Kirk
who sits in this court room?

19:26.088 --> 19:28.283
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

19:28.357 --> 19:30.348
Do you wish to cross-examine?

19:30.426 --> 19:32.553
No questions.

19:32.628 --> 19:33.788
You may step down.

19:40.936 --> 19:44.702
I now call Dr. McCoy
to the stand.

19:44.773 --> 19:47.708
Service rank--
lieutenant commander.

19:47.776 --> 19:49.539
Position-- ship's surgeon.

19:49.611 --> 19:53.240
Current assignment--
U.S.S. Enterprise.

19:53.315 --> 19:55.476
Commendations--
Legion of Honor.

19:55.551 --> 19:59.647
Awards of valor--
decorated by Starfleet surgeons.

19:59.722 --> 20:03.317
Doctor, you are, on the record,
an expert in psychology,

20:03.392 --> 20:05.952
especially space psychology--
patterns which develop

20:06.028 --> 20:07.620
in the close quarters
of a ship

20:07.696 --> 20:09.163
during long voyages
in deep space.

20:09.231 --> 20:12.132
I know
something about it.

20:12.201 --> 20:15.637
You havejust heard the testimony
of your own personnel officer,

20:15.704 --> 20:19.299
that it was an action
of the then Ensign Kirk

20:19.375 --> 20:21.240
which placed
an unerasable blot

20:21.310 --> 20:23.835
on the record
of the then Lieutenant Finney.

20:23.912 --> 20:25.903
Psychologically, Doctor,
is it possible

20:25.981 --> 20:29.144
that Lieutenant Finney
blamed Kirk for the incident?

20:29.218 --> 20:31.482
It's possible.

20:31.553 --> 20:34.750
He could have hated Kirk
down through the years,

20:34.823 --> 20:37.314
blamed him for being
passed over for promotion,

20:37.393 --> 20:40.760
blamed him for never being given
a command of his own, correct?

20:40.829 --> 20:42.319
He could have.

20:42.398 --> 20:44.832
Now, let us hypothesize, Doctor.

20:44.900 --> 20:48.199
Is it normal for a person
to return affection for hatred?

20:48.270 --> 20:50.465
- No.
- Do we not tend to, at first,

20:50.539 --> 20:53.940
resent and then actively dislike
the person who hates us?

20:54.009 --> 20:55.943
Wait a minute.
I don't quite follow you.

20:56.011 --> 20:57.273
Hypothetically.

20:57.346 --> 21:00.338
Would not Captain Smith
begin to hate

21:00.416 --> 21:02.816
Lieutenant Commander Jones

21:02.885 --> 21:04.375
once he learned that
Lieutenant Commander Jones

21:04.453 --> 21:06.853
hated and detested him?

21:06.922 --> 21:09.891
Well, yes, I suppose
it could happen.

21:09.958 --> 21:11.186
Then I askyou,

21:11.260 --> 21:14.093
is it not possible
that Captain Kirk became aware

21:14.163 --> 21:16.723
of Lieutenant Commander Finney's
hatred toward him

21:16.799 --> 21:18.892
and perhaps,
even involuntarily,

21:18.967 --> 21:20.696
began to reciprocate?

21:20.769 --> 21:22.327
Not Captain Kirk.

21:22.404 --> 21:25.339
Any normal human, Doctor.
Is it possible?

21:25.407 --> 21:27.170
But he's not that kind of a man.

21:27.242 --> 21:31.076
Is it theoretically
possible, Doctor?

21:31.146 --> 21:32.306
Yes.

21:32.381 --> 21:33.643
It's possible.

21:33.715 --> 21:35.706
Thank you.

21:35.784 --> 21:39.880
- Your witness, Mr. Cogley.
- No questions.

21:41.323 --> 21:42.585
You may step down.

21:47.062 --> 21:48.290
Mr. Cogley.

21:49.598 --> 21:52.066
You've listened to testimony
from three witnesses.

21:52.134 --> 21:54.432
In neither instance
have you availed yourself

21:54.503 --> 21:56.437
of your right
to cross-examine.

21:56.505 --> 21:58.132
Have you abrogated
that right?

21:59.508 --> 22:02.443
Well, sir, truth is,
I've been holding back

22:02.511 --> 22:04.376
till we get this preliminary
business out of the way.

22:04.446 --> 22:07.882
I'd like to call
Captain Kirk to the stand.

22:10.285 --> 22:17.691
James T. Kirk,
serial number SC-937-0176-CEC.

22:17.759 --> 22:19.386
Service rank-- captain.

22:19.461 --> 22:21.622
Position-- Starship command.

22:21.697 --> 22:24.393
Current assignment--
U.S.S. Enterprise.

22:24.466 --> 22:28.402
Commendations-- Palm Leaf
Of Axinar Peace Mission,

22:28.470 --> 22:30.597
Grand Kite
Order of Tactics,

22:30.672 --> 22:32.367
Class of Excellence,

22:32.441 --> 22:34.705
Frenterus Ribbon
of Commendation,

22:34.776 --> 22:37.643
- Classes first and second--
- May it please the court.

22:37.713 --> 22:39.772
Court recognizes counsel
for the prosecution.

22:39.848 --> 22:43.875
The prosecution concedes
the inestimable record of Captain Kirk.

22:43.952 --> 22:45.647
Mr. Cogley?

22:45.721 --> 22:48.690
I wouldn't want to slow
the wheels of progress.

22:48.757 --> 22:50.588
But then on the other hand,

22:50.659 --> 22:54.117
I wouldn't want those wheels
to run over my client

22:54.196 --> 22:56.562
in their unbridled haste.

22:58.934 --> 22:59.866
Continue.

23:01.169 --> 23:02.431
Awards of valor--

23:02.504 --> 23:03.698
medal of honor,

23:03.772 --> 23:05.740
silverpalm with cluster,

23:05.807 --> 23:09.436
Starfleet citation
for conspicuous gallantry,

23:09.511 --> 23:11.877
- Carragite Order of Heroism--
- Stop!

23:11.947 --> 23:13.380
I think that's enough.

23:13.448 --> 23:16.144
I wouldn't want
to slow things up too much.

23:16.218 --> 23:17.845
Thank you.

23:17.920 --> 23:19.114
Now, Captain,

23:19.187 --> 23:21.655
despite what these
machines indicate,

23:21.723 --> 23:23.884
was there indeed
a red alert

23:23.959 --> 23:26.052
before you
jettisoned the pod?

23:26.128 --> 23:27.595
Yes, sir, there was.

23:27.663 --> 23:30.530
Please tell us about it.

23:32.367 --> 23:35.393
Firstly, I am at a loss
to explain the errors

23:35.470 --> 23:38.234
in the extract
from the computer log.

23:38.307 --> 23:40.571
We were in an ion storm.

23:40.642 --> 23:44.078
Everyone here in this court
knows the dangers involved.

23:44.146 --> 23:46.080
I was in command.

23:46.148 --> 23:48.981
The decisions were mine,
no one else's.

23:49.051 --> 23:51.679
Charges of malice
have been raised.

23:51.753 --> 23:53.914
There was no malice.

23:53.989 --> 23:57.425
Lieutenant Commander Finney
was a member of my crew,

23:57.492 --> 24:00.791
and that's exactly the way
he was treated.

24:00.862 --> 24:04.525
It has been suggested that
I panicked on the bridge

24:04.600 --> 24:07.034
and jettisoned the ion pod
prematurely.

24:07.102 --> 24:08.729
That is not so.

24:10.072 --> 24:13.132
You've heard some
of the details of my record.

24:13.208 --> 24:15.540
This was not my first crisis.

24:15.611 --> 24:17.545
It was one of many.

24:17.613 --> 24:21.049
During it, I did what
my experience and training

24:21.116 --> 24:23.209
required me to do.

24:23.285 --> 24:26.379
I took the proper steps
in the proper order.

24:26.455 --> 24:29.049
I did exactly
what had to be done

24:29.124 --> 24:31.422
exactly when it
should have been done.

24:31.493 --> 24:33.222
You did the right thing,

24:33.295 --> 24:35.525
but would you do it again?

24:38.233 --> 24:40.224
Given the same circumstances...

24:41.970 --> 24:45.235
I would do the same thing
without hesitation...

24:45.307 --> 24:47.241
because the steps I took

24:47.309 --> 24:50.244
in the order I took them

24:50.312 --> 24:54.214
were absolutely necessary
if I were to save my ship.

24:55.617 --> 24:57.744
And nothing...

24:57.819 --> 25:00.652
is more important
than my ship.

25:07.596 --> 25:09.723
Your witness, Miss Shaw.

25:14.436 --> 25:17.872
The prosecution does not wish
to dishonor this man,

25:17.939 --> 25:19.873
but facts are facts.

25:19.941 --> 25:22.375
I must invite
the attention of the court

25:22.444 --> 25:24.878
and Captain Kirk
to this visual extract

25:24.946 --> 25:26.937
from the Enterprise
computer log.

25:27.015 --> 25:28.710
Playback.

25:32.554 --> 25:34.988
What you are about to see

25:35.057 --> 25:36.991
is precisely what took place

25:37.059 --> 25:38.492
on the Enterprise bridge

25:38.560 --> 25:39.993
during the ion storm.

25:44.633 --> 25:47.067
Meteorology reports
ion storm upcoming, Captain.

25:47.135 --> 25:50.070
We'll need somebody
in the pod for readings.

25:50.138 --> 25:53.073
Mr. Finneyis top
of duty roster, Captain.

25:53.141 --> 25:54.073
Post him.

25:54.142 --> 25:55.575
Attention,
Commander Finney,

25:55.644 --> 25:58.579
report topod
for reading on ion slates.

25:58.647 --> 26:00.080
[Finney]
Message Received.

26:00.148 --> 26:01.740
Officer posted,
Captain.

26:06.521 --> 26:08.955
Standby on alert status,
Mr. Spock.

26:09.024 --> 26:09.956
Acknowledged.

26:10.025 --> 26:11.856
Approaching
ion storm, sir.

26:11.927 --> 26:14.862
Warp factor 1,
Mr. Hanson.

26:14.930 --> 26:16.557
Warp 1, sir.

26:21.870 --> 26:22.859
Reverse.

26:28.443 --> 26:30.468
Stop.

26:30.545 --> 26:33.708
Go forward with
magnification on the panel.

26:37.486 --> 26:38.418
Freeze that.

26:41.189 --> 26:44.955
Captain Kirk is now
signaling a yellow alert.

26:45.026 --> 26:48.189
Go forward, normal view.

26:48.263 --> 26:50.197
Call from
the pod, sir.

26:50.265 --> 26:51.391
Tie in.

26:51.466 --> 26:52.899
Finney here, Captain.

26:52.968 --> 26:54.401
Ion readings in progress.

26:54.469 --> 26:57.029
Make it fast, Ben.
I may have to go to red alert.

26:57.105 --> 26:58.129
Affirmative.

27:01.376 --> 27:03.606
- Holdy our course, Mr. Hanson.
- Aye, aye, sir.

27:06.581 --> 27:09.175
Natural vibrations,
force 2, Captain.

27:11.419 --> 27:14.684
- Force 3.
- Engineering, then ionpod.

27:14.756 --> 27:16.223
Aye, aye, sir.

27:16.291 --> 27:18.020
- Engineering.
- One-thirdmore thrust.

27:18.093 --> 27:22.530
- Working.
- [Finney]ionpod.

27:22.597 --> 27:24.121
Standby to get out
of there, Ben.

27:24.199 --> 27:25.860
Aye, aye, sir.

27:25.934 --> 27:28.198
Force 5, sir.

27:28.270 --> 27:30.363
Steady as she goes,
Mr. Hanson.

27:30.438 --> 27:31.462
Freeze that!

27:38.113 --> 27:39.876
If the court will notice,

27:39.948 --> 27:41.381
the log plainly shows

27:41.449 --> 27:44.418
the defendant's finger pressing
the jettison button.

27:44.486 --> 27:47.319
The condition signal
reads yellow alert.

27:47.389 --> 27:50.688
Not red alert,
but simply yellow alert.

27:50.759 --> 27:53.227
When the pod containing
Lieutenant Commander Finney

27:53.295 --> 27:54.227
was jettisoned,

27:54.296 --> 27:57.026
the emergency
did not as yet exist.

28:08.009 --> 28:10.034
But that's not
the way it happened.

28:15.050 --> 28:18.383
Captain's Log,
Stardate 2949.9.

28:18.453 --> 28:20.853
The evidence presented
by the visual playback

28:20.922 --> 28:23.857
to my general
court-martial was damning.

28:23.925 --> 28:27.053
I suspect even my attorney
has begun to doubt me.

28:27.128 --> 28:29.995
- Computers don't lie.
- Are you suggesting that I did?

28:30.065 --> 28:32.829
I'm suggesting that
maybe you did have a lapse.

28:32.901 --> 28:35.995
It was possible, you know,
with the strain you were under.

28:36.071 --> 28:39.632
There's still time to change our plea.
I could get you off.

28:43.411 --> 28:45.709
Two days ago, I would've staked
anything on my judgment.

28:45.780 --> 28:48.112
You did.
Your professional career.

28:48.183 --> 28:51.641
I spent my whole life training
for decisionsjust like that one.

28:53.555 --> 28:55.079
My whole life.

28:57.459 --> 29:00.895
Is it possible that
when the moment came, l--

29:03.832 --> 29:07.097
No.
I know what I did.

29:07.168 --> 29:09.432
You can pull out
if you want to.

29:09.504 --> 29:13.338
There's no place to go, except back
to court and hear the verdict.

29:13.408 --> 29:14.375
[Communicator Beeps]

29:15.911 --> 29:17.003
Kirk here.

29:17.078 --> 29:20.411
Captain, I've run a complete
megalyte survey on the computer.

29:20.482 --> 29:23.451
I'll tell you what you found.
Nothing, right?

29:23.518 --> 29:25.076
You sound bitter, Captain.

29:25.153 --> 29:27.451
Not bitter enough to forget
to thank you for your efforts.

29:27.522 --> 29:29.888
Further instructions?

29:29.958 --> 29:33.621
No.
It's not all bad, Mr. Spock.

29:33.695 --> 29:37.825
Who knows. You may be able to beat
your next captain at chess. Kirk out.

29:45.440 --> 29:46.998
Chess.

29:48.576 --> 29:49.804
Jame.

29:49.878 --> 29:52.108
This is Lieutenant
Commander Finney's daughter.

29:52.180 --> 29:55.172
Mr. Cogley, we've
got to stop this.

29:55.250 --> 29:57.684
Make him take
a ground assignment.

29:57.752 --> 30:01.518
I realize it wasn't his fault.
I won't make any trouble.

30:01.589 --> 30:04.149
- Make him change his plea.
- It's too late for that,Jame.

30:04.225 --> 30:06.455
But I'm glad you don't blame me
anymore for what happened.

30:06.528 --> 30:09.361
I was just so upset that night.
I'm sorry.

30:09.431 --> 30:12.025
- Don't say any more.
- But I have to.

30:12.100 --> 30:15.069
I never realized how close
you and Dad had been

30:15.136 --> 30:17.468
until I read through
some papers he wrote,

30:17.539 --> 30:20.633
Ietters to Mother and me.

30:20.709 --> 30:23.405
I don't know how I ever could've
thought that you--

30:24.479 --> 30:26.310
Mr. Cogley,

30:26.381 --> 30:28.815
ruining Jim won't change
what's happened.

30:28.883 --> 30:32.546
That's very commendable,
Miss Finney, but most unusual.

30:32.620 --> 30:34.679
After all,
Captain Kirk is accused

30:34.756 --> 30:36.348
of causing
your father's death,

30:36.424 --> 30:38.551
and the evidence
would indicate his guilt.

30:38.626 --> 30:43.256
- I was just thinking of Jim.
- I know, and I thank you.

30:43.331 --> 30:45.356
I have to go and change.
You ready?

30:45.433 --> 30:49.130
No, but I may
be getting ready.

30:53.008 --> 30:56.444
Bishop, half level right.

30:56.511 --> 30:59.378
- Well, I had to see it to believe it.
- Explain.

30:59.447 --> 31:01.540
They're about to lop off the captain's
professional head, and you're

31:01.616 --> 31:04.517
- playing chess with the computer.
- That is true.

31:05.687 --> 31:08.417
Mr. Spock, you're the most
cold-blooded man I've ever known.

31:09.491 --> 31:10.981
Why, thank you, Doctor.

31:11.059 --> 31:14.893
I'vejust won my fourth game.

31:14.963 --> 31:18.421
- That's impossible.
- Observe for yourself.

31:18.500 --> 31:20.968
Rook to king's pawn 4.

31:21.036 --> 31:23.231
Bishop half level right.

31:23.304 --> 31:26.899
Now, this is
the computer's move.

31:26.975 --> 31:28.499
And now mine.

31:32.647 --> 31:33.909
Checkmate.

31:35.450 --> 31:38.419
Mechanically,
the computer's flawless.

31:38.486 --> 31:39.919
Therefore, logically,
its report

31:39.988 --> 31:42.422
of the captain's guilt
is infallible.

31:42.490 --> 31:44.424
I could not
accept that, however.

31:44.492 --> 31:46.517
So you tested
the program bank.

31:46.594 --> 31:47.526
Exactly.

31:47.595 --> 31:50.462
I programmed it myself
for chess some months ago.

31:50.532 --> 31:52.864
The best I should've been
able to attain was a draw.

31:54.102 --> 31:56.332
Well, why are you
just sitting there?

31:56.404 --> 31:58.838
Transporter room, stand by.
We're beaming down.

32:11.719 --> 32:13.846
Court is now in session.

32:17.892 --> 32:19.883
The board will
entertain motions

32:19.961 --> 32:21.724
before delivering
its verdict.

32:21.796 --> 32:23.889
Counsel for the prosecution?

32:23.965 --> 32:26.092
Sir, the prosecution rests.

32:26.167 --> 32:28.260
Counsel for the defense?

32:30.972 --> 32:32.098
Sir--

32:36.244 --> 32:37.939
- The defense rests.
- [Door Opens]

32:42.484 --> 32:44.247
Mr. Cogley.

32:45.320 --> 32:46.412
Mr. Cogley!

32:46.488 --> 32:50.424
Sir, some new evidence has just
been brought to my attention.

32:50.492 --> 32:53.290
- I'd like to ask the court--
- Objection!

32:53.361 --> 32:56.091
Counsel for the defense
has rested his case.

32:56.164 --> 32:59.429
- Of what nature is this evidence?
- I can't tell you, I have to show you.

32:59.501 --> 33:02.129
Mr. Cogley is well-known
for his theatrics.

33:02.203 --> 33:05.764
Is saving an innocent man's
career a theatric?

33:05.840 --> 33:08.638
Counsels will direct
their remarks to the bench.

33:08.710 --> 33:10.644
I'd be delighted to, sir,

33:10.712 --> 33:13.545
now that I've got
something human to talk about.

33:13.615 --> 33:16.277
Rights, sir, human rights--

33:16.351 --> 33:19.343
the Bible, the Code
of Hammurabi

33:19.420 --> 33:22.048
and of Justinian,
Magna Carta,

33:22.123 --> 33:24.057
the Constitution
of the United States,

33:24.125 --> 33:28.061
fundamental declarations
of the Martian colonies,

33:28.129 --> 33:31.189
the statutes of Alpha 3--

33:31.266 --> 33:36.169
Gentlemen, these documents
all speak of rights.

33:36.237 --> 33:39.434
Rights of the accused
to a trial by his peers,

33:39.507 --> 33:42.169
to be represented by counsel,

33:42.243 --> 33:46.077
the rights of cross-examination,
but most importantly,

33:46.147 --> 33:48.081
the right to be confronted

33:48.149 --> 33:50.208
by the witnesses against him--

33:50.285 --> 33:52.685
a right to which my client
has been denied.

33:52.754 --> 33:55.689
Your Honor, that is ridiculous.
We produced the witnesses in court.

33:55.757 --> 33:57.918
My learned opponent
had the opportunity

33:57.992 --> 34:01.519
- to see them, cross-examine them--
- All but one!

34:01.596 --> 34:04.531
The most devastating witness
against my client

34:04.599 --> 34:05.861
is not a human being.

34:05.934 --> 34:08.094
It's a machine,

34:08.168 --> 34:09.601
an information system.

34:09.670 --> 34:12.264
The computer log
of the Enterprise.

34:12.340 --> 34:15.206
I ask this court adjourn and
reconvene aboard that vessel.

34:15.275 --> 34:17.471
- I protest, Your Honor.
- And I repeat,

34:17.545 --> 34:19.206
I speak of rights.

34:19.280 --> 34:20.713
A machine has none.

34:20.782 --> 34:22.750
A man must.

34:22.817 --> 34:25.911
My client has the right
to face his accuser,

34:25.987 --> 34:28.922
and if you do not
grant him that right,

34:28.989 --> 34:31.618
you have brought us down
to the level of the machine.

34:31.693 --> 34:34.786
Indeed, you have elevated
that machine above us.

34:36.431 --> 34:38.831
I ask that my motion
be granted,

34:38.900 --> 34:40.764
and more than that, gentlemen,

34:40.835 --> 34:42.768
in the name of humanity,

34:42.837 --> 34:45.465
fading in the shadow
of the machine,

34:45.540 --> 34:46.905
I demand it.

34:46.975 --> 34:48.465
I demand it!

34:56.050 --> 34:58.985
Captain's Log,
Stardate 2950. 1.

34:59.053 --> 35:00.714
After due
consideration,

35:00.788 --> 35:03.416
the general court-martial
has reconvened

35:03.491 --> 35:04.981
on board the Enterprise.

35:05.059 --> 35:07.027
How many games of chess
did you win

35:07.095 --> 35:08.824
from the computer,
Mr. Spock?

35:08.896 --> 35:10.921
Five in all.

35:10.999 --> 35:13.126
- May that be considered unusual?
- Affirmative.

35:13.201 --> 35:15.260
Why?

35:15.336 --> 35:18.669
I personally programmed
the computer for chess months ago.

35:18.740 --> 35:21.004
I gave the machine
an understanding of the game

35:21.075 --> 35:22.940
equal to my own.

35:23.011 --> 35:25.536
The computer cannot
make an error.

35:25.613 --> 35:28.047
Assuming that I
do not either,

35:28.116 --> 35:29.845
the best that could
normally be hoped for

35:29.917 --> 35:32.613
would be stalemate
after stalemate,

35:32.687 --> 35:35.656
and yet I beat
the machine five times.

35:35.723 --> 35:39.989
Someone, either accidentally
or deliberately,

35:40.061 --> 35:41.824
adjusted the programming

35:41.896 --> 35:43.830
and, the refore, the memory banks
of that computer.

35:46.401 --> 35:48.926
Could that have had an effect

35:49.003 --> 35:50.766
on the visual playback we saw?

35:50.838 --> 35:52.499
Object!

35:52.573 --> 35:55.007
The witness would be
making a conclusion.

35:55.076 --> 35:58.341
- Sustained.
- Hypothetically, Mr. Spock,

35:58.413 --> 36:00.677
hypothetically, Miss Shaw,

36:00.748 --> 36:03.774
if what you suggest had been done,

36:03.851 --> 36:06.513
it would be beyond
the capabilities of most men.

36:06.587 --> 36:08.953
- Is that true?
- Affirmative.

36:09.023 --> 36:12.720
What man aboard ship
would it not be beyond?

36:12.794 --> 36:14.227
The captain, myself,

36:14.295 --> 36:15.728
and the records officer.

36:15.797 --> 36:18.288
Mm-hmm.
And at the moment,

36:18.366 --> 36:20.300
you have
no records officer.

36:20.368 --> 36:21.300
Affirmative.

36:21.369 --> 36:22.802
Until he was lost,

36:22.870 --> 36:25.395
our records officer was
Lieutenant Commander Finney.

36:25.473 --> 36:26.804
Captain Kirk,

36:26.874 --> 36:29.809
will you tell
the steps you took

36:29.877 --> 36:32.903
to find Mr. Finney
after the storm?

36:32.980 --> 36:34.880
I instituted
a Phase 1 search.

36:34.949 --> 36:36.883
Describe
a Phase 1 search.

36:36.951 --> 36:39.249
It's a painstaking,
thorough attempt

36:39.320 --> 36:41.254
in and around the ship

36:41.322 --> 36:44.086
to find a man who's
unable to respond.

36:44.158 --> 36:45.750
It presupposes,
does it not,

36:45.827 --> 36:48.819
that a man wishes
to be found?

36:48.896 --> 36:50.329
I beg your pardon?

36:50.398 --> 36:53.333
If you start
a search for a man,

36:53.401 --> 36:56.370
you assume, don't you,
that he wants to be found?

36:56.437 --> 36:57.369
Yes.

36:57.438 --> 36:59.872
On a ship of this size,

36:59.941 --> 37:02.171
could a man
evade such a search?

37:05.346 --> 37:06.779
Possibly.

37:08.583 --> 37:12.314
Gentlemen, I submit to you

37:12.387 --> 37:15.379
that Lieutenant Commander Ben Finney
is not dead.

37:16.524 --> 37:18.788
Mr. Cogley,

37:18.860 --> 37:20.452
we are waiting for proof
of your extraordinary statement.

37:20.528 --> 37:21.927
You shall have it,

37:21.996 --> 37:23.896
but first I need
the court's cooperation

37:23.965 --> 37:25.830
in conducting an experiment.

37:25.900 --> 37:27.527
Captain Kirk.

37:27.602 --> 37:28.796
Gentlemen,
for this experiment,

37:28.870 --> 37:31.304
it'll be necessary
for all personnel,

37:31.372 --> 37:34.864
except for the court and
the command crew, to leave the ship.

37:34.942 --> 37:37.968
I am ordering all others to report
to the transporter room.

37:38.045 --> 37:41.537
- Including myself, sir.
- This court is not adjourned.

37:41.616 --> 37:44.312
I have an errand ashore
of vital importance to this court.

37:44.385 --> 37:46.945
- I will return.
- Very well.

37:47.021 --> 37:48.454
Thank you, sir.

37:48.523 --> 37:51.014
Captain, are you maintaining
an engine crew aboard?

37:51.092 --> 37:54.357
Our impulse engines have been shut down.
We'll maintain orbit by momentum.

37:54.429 --> 37:56.192
When the orbit decays?

37:56.264 --> 37:59.324
We hope to be finished
long before that.

38:07.341 --> 38:08.774
Ready, Mr. Spock?

38:08.843 --> 38:09.775
Affirmative,
Captain.

38:09.844 --> 38:12.369
Gentlemen,
this computer

38:12.447 --> 38:14.540
has an auditory
sensor.

38:14.615 --> 38:16.378
It can, in effect,
hear sounds.

38:16.451 --> 38:17.884
By installing
a booster,

38:17.952 --> 38:19.817
we can increase
that capability

38:19.887 --> 38:21.684
on the order of
1 to the 4th power.

38:21.756 --> 38:24.691
The computer
should bring us every sound

38:24.759 --> 38:26.852
occurring on the ship.

38:26.928 --> 38:29.954
All personnel have left the ship
as ordered, sir.

38:30.031 --> 38:31.794
Dr. McCoy?

38:31.866 --> 38:33.834
All right,
Mr. Spock.

38:34.902 --> 38:37.700
[Loud Beating]

38:45.580 --> 38:48.014
Turn it down a little.

38:48.082 --> 38:50.277
[Volume Decreases]

38:54.889 --> 38:57.824
Gentlemen, that sound
is caused by the heartbeats

38:57.892 --> 39:00.452
of all the people
on board the ship.

39:01.796 --> 39:06.028
Dr. McCoy will use
this white sound device

39:06.100 --> 39:09.866
to mask out
each person's heartbeat

39:09.937 --> 39:12.565
so that it will be eliminated
from the sounds we're hearing.

39:12.640 --> 39:14.767
First, the captain.

39:17.945 --> 39:18.912
Mr. Spock.

39:37.431 --> 39:40.366
And lastly, myself.

39:43.437 --> 39:44.870
That's all of us,

39:44.939 --> 39:47.305
except for crewman
in the transporter room.

39:47.375 --> 39:49.309
Mr. Spock, eliminate
his heartbeat.

39:49.377 --> 39:50.810
[Heartbeat Continues]

39:50.878 --> 39:53.369
That accounts for everyone.

39:53.447 --> 39:56.280
[Single Heart Beats]

40:18.706 --> 40:20.503
Finney.

40:25.279 --> 40:26.769
Localize that.

40:31.752 --> 40:33.344
"B" Deck.

40:33.421 --> 40:35.787
In or near
Engineering.

40:35.856 --> 40:39.348
Seal off "B" Deck, sections 18-Y
through 23-D.

40:39.427 --> 40:40.359
Acknowledged.

40:40.428 --> 40:41.861
[Beep]

40:50.037 --> 40:51.902
So Finney is alive.

40:51.973 --> 40:53.406
It would seem so.

40:53.474 --> 40:55.840
Commodore, this is
my problem.

40:55.910 --> 40:58.470
I'd appreciate it if
no one left the bridge.

40:59.547 --> 41:01.481
Sam Cogley
had gone a shore

41:01.549 --> 41:03.483
to bring Jame Finney
on board.

41:03.551 --> 41:04.984
We felt
Jame's presence

41:05.052 --> 41:06.986
would make Finney
easierto handle

41:07.054 --> 41:08.988
in the event Finney
really were alive.

41:09.056 --> 41:10.421
Ben.

41:12.860 --> 41:14.691
[Kirk]
Ben Finney.

41:20.901 --> 41:22.766
Mr. Spock,
encountering variants.

41:22.837 --> 41:24.737
- Compensate.
- What is happening?

41:24.805 --> 41:26.363
The orbit's beginning to decay.

41:28.509 --> 41:30.101
Ben, where are you?

41:42.857 --> 41:45.553
Hello, Captain!

41:46.627 --> 41:49.653
Nothing to say,
Captain?

41:53.034 --> 41:54.467
I'm glad
you're alive.

41:54.535 --> 41:55.968
You mean
you're relieved

41:56.037 --> 41:57.971
because you think
your career

41:58.039 --> 41:59.700
is saved.

41:59.774 --> 42:01.207
Well,you're wrong.

42:09.150 --> 42:10.515
Ben!

42:12.486 --> 42:14.420
Ben, it's not
too late.

42:14.488 --> 42:15.921
We can help you.

42:15.990 --> 42:18.515
Like you helped me
all along, kept me down,

42:18.592 --> 42:20.492
robbed me
of my own command?

42:20.561 --> 42:21.994
I'm a good officer.

42:22.063 --> 42:23.928
As good as you.

42:23.998 --> 42:26.432
I've watched you
for years.

42:26.500 --> 42:29.560
The great Captain Kirk.

42:35.142 --> 42:38.077
They told you
to do it to me.

42:38.145 --> 42:40.079
You all conspired
against me.

42:40.147 --> 42:41.580
You ruined me,

42:41.649 --> 42:44.345
but you won't
do it anymore.

42:44.418 --> 42:45.385
Uhh.

42:53.627 --> 42:55.356
Put the phaser
down, Ben.

42:55.429 --> 42:57.863
Oh, I wouldn't
kill you, Captain.

42:57.932 --> 43:01.368
Your own death would mean
too little to you,

43:01.435 --> 43:03.062
But your ship--

43:03.137 --> 43:04.570
What about my ship?

43:04.638 --> 43:05.570
It's dead.

43:05.639 --> 43:07.072
I've killed it.

43:07.141 --> 43:09.575
I tapped out
your primary energy circuits.

43:12.980 --> 43:16.279
Mr. Spock, what's
our orbit status?

43:16.350 --> 43:17.908
Decaying, Captain.

43:17.985 --> 43:19.384
Variants
at second level

43:19.453 --> 43:22.081
depreciating
unusually fast.

43:22.156 --> 43:23.589
You're out of power.

43:23.657 --> 43:25.591
I know
this ship, too.

43:25.659 --> 43:27.593
The Enterprise
should've been mine.

43:27.661 --> 43:29.754
You kept me from it.

43:29.830 --> 43:31.058
Ben.

43:33.501 --> 43:34.934
Why kill
innocent people?

43:35.002 --> 43:35.934
Innocent?

43:36.003 --> 43:37.834
Ha ha ha!

43:37.905 --> 43:40.430
Officers and gentlemen,

43:40.508 --> 43:42.999
captains all,

43:43.077 --> 43:45.841
except for Finney
and his one mistake

43:45.913 --> 43:49.178
a long time ago,

43:49.250 --> 43:51.150
but they
don't forget.

43:51.218 --> 43:53.743
I logged the mistake,
Ben. Blame me.

43:53.821 --> 43:54.947
But they are to blame.

43:55.022 --> 43:56.011
All of them.

43:57.091 --> 43:59.958
I was a good officer.

44:00.027 --> 44:02.291
I really was.

44:04.031 --> 44:07.432
I loved the service more
than any man ever dared.

44:07.501 --> 44:10.163
Mr. Spock,
we're running out of time.

44:10.237 --> 44:12.899
Gentlemen, if you'll hurry
to the transporter room--

44:12.973 --> 44:15.908
Mr. Spock, the court
hasn't reached a verdict.

44:15.976 --> 44:18.410
We will hear
this witness out.

44:18.479 --> 44:19.912
Very well, sir.

44:21.849 --> 44:23.077
It's not too late.

44:23.150 --> 44:24.583
You can be helped,

44:24.652 --> 44:26.779
but if you kill
those people--

44:26.854 --> 44:28.412
Why shouldn't I?

44:28.489 --> 44:30.923
They killed me,
didn't they?

44:30.991 --> 44:32.891
It's a fair trade.

44:34.428 --> 44:36.453
Is Jame included
in that deal?

44:37.531 --> 44:39.726
What do you mean?

44:39.800 --> 44:41.427
She's on board by now.

44:43.103 --> 44:44.661
Yes. She's on board.

44:44.738 --> 44:47.366
Why did you do that?

44:47.441 --> 44:50.069
Why did you bring
her here?

44:50.144 --> 44:51.406
I'll kill you!

45:40.494 --> 45:41.927
Beaten and sobbing,

45:41.996 --> 45:44.430
Finney told me where
he had sabotaged

45:44.498 --> 45:45.931
the prime energy circuits.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.934
The damage he'd caused
was considerable,

45:48.002 --> 45:48.991
but not irreparable.

45:49.069 --> 45:51.435
With luck,
I could effect repairs

45:51.505 --> 45:53.973
before our orbit
decayed completely.

46:27.308 --> 46:28.570
Power returning,
Mr. Spock.

46:28.642 --> 46:30.906
Up 14 points
and rising.

46:30.978 --> 46:32.912
Activate port
impulse engines.

46:32.980 --> 46:33.912
One-third power.

46:33.981 --> 46:35.608
One-third power.

46:42.289 --> 46:43.984
Variants fading.

46:53.334 --> 46:55.165
Orbit stabilizing.

47:08.148 --> 47:09.877
All secure, sir.

47:15.656 --> 47:18.591
Unless the prosecution
has an objection,

47:18.659 --> 47:21.594
I rule this court
to be dismissed.

47:21.662 --> 47:24.222
Absolutely
no objection, sir.

47:44.051 --> 47:47.111
How long will it be
before I see you again?

47:47.187 --> 47:50.122
At the risk of sounding
like a mystic,

47:50.190 --> 47:52.124
that depends
on the stars.

47:52.192 --> 47:55.127
Sam Cogley asked me
to give you something.

47:55.195 --> 47:58.130
It's not a first edition,
just a book.

47:58.198 --> 48:00.189
Sam says that
makes it special.

48:00.267 --> 48:02.701
I didn't get
to thank him.

48:02.770 --> 48:04.635
He's busy on a case.

48:04.705 --> 48:06.673
He's defending
Ben Finney.

48:06.740 --> 48:08.708
He says he'll win.

48:08.776 --> 48:11.210
I wouldn't be
a bit surprised.

48:11.278 --> 48:14.714
Do you think it would cause
a complete breakdown

48:14.782 --> 48:15.874
of discipline

48:15.949 --> 48:18.884
if a lowly lieutenant
kissed a Starship captain

48:18.952 --> 48:21.386
on the bridge of his ship?

48:21.455 --> 48:22.820
Let's try.

48:32.666 --> 48:34.099
See? No change.

48:34.168 --> 48:35.601
Discipline goes on.

48:35.669 --> 48:38.263
And so must
the Enterprise.

48:38.338 --> 48:39.737
Goodbye,Jim.

48:40.808 --> 48:43.174
Goodbye, Areel.

48:43.243 --> 48:44.733
Better luck next time.

48:44.812 --> 48:47.747
I had pretty good luck
this time.

48:47.815 --> 48:49.248
I lost, didn't l?

49:09.136 --> 49:11.570
She's a very good lawyer.

49:11.638 --> 49:13.071
Obviously.

49:13.140 --> 49:15.074
Indeed she is.
