Joey:
<i>Previously on</i>
Liv and Maddie<i> ...</i>

00:06.339 --> 00:08.172
As the head coach of the
University of Wisconsin Beloit,

00:08.175 --> 00:13.278
I would like to offer you
a basketball scholarship.

00:13.280 --> 00:15.381
<i>You're SkyVolt now.</i>

00:16.283 --> 00:18.517
SkyVolt is dead?

00:18.519 --> 00:20.019
It was my choice.

00:20.021 --> 00:22.888
I love<i> Voltage,</i>
but I wanna be here.

00:22.890 --> 00:25.224
Let's go to college together!

00:25.226 --> 00:27.726
Liv, you gave up
your show for me?

00:27.728 --> 00:30.629
Hey, Wills,
how's California?

00:30.631 --> 00:32.131
I miss you so much.

00:32.133 --> 00:34.667
<i>Not for long, Mads.</i>

00:34.668 --> 00:37.202
<i>They're gonna call</i>
<i>and offer you a basketball</i>
<i>scholarship to SESU!</i>

00:37.204 --> 00:39.738
<i>But you have to be in LA</i>
<i>right away for training camp.</i>

00:39.740 --> 00:41.407
What about your dad?

00:41.409 --> 00:43.375
Oh... what about Liv?

00:43.377 --> 00:47.246
Maddie...
what are you gonna do?

00:50.918 --> 00:52.351
Hey.

00:52.353 --> 00:55.521
Hey, future college roomie.

00:55.523 --> 00:59.658
Um, so Liv,
I have something
to tell you.

00:59.660 --> 01:02.261
I have something to tell you.

01:02.263 --> 01:05.197
Our future freshman dorm
is going to be painted...

01:05.199 --> 01:07.266
(gasps) sunshine citron!

01:08.903 --> 01:12.404
Uh, I just got a call
from SESU,

01:12.406 --> 01:16.108
and they offered me
a basketball scholarship.

01:17.711 --> 01:19.311
Wow!

01:20.381 --> 01:24.616
Yeah, and they... told me
that they need me there
right away...

01:24.618 --> 01:28.287
so I... told them yes.

01:28.289 --> 01:30.389
What?

01:30.391 --> 01:33.625
You've already decided
without even talking to me?

01:33.627 --> 01:38.697
Well, I mean...
Liv, this is Southern California
State University.

01:38.699 --> 01:43.669
You know, it's my dream school.
This is a life-changing offer
for me.

01:44.705 --> 01:47.239
Maddie, I gave up
<i>Voltage</i> for you.

01:47.241 --> 01:50.409
Hold on.
I did not ask you
to do that.

01:50.411 --> 01:52.878
No, but you didn't have to,
I thought that was the point.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.414
I told you
to follow your heart.

01:55.416 --> 01:57.483
And my heart
wants to be with you!

01:57.485 --> 01:59.251
I thought that's
what you wanted too!

01:59.253 --> 02:02.287
Remember, sisters by chance,
friends by choice?

02:02.289 --> 02:06.892
That is not fair, Liv.
I have always supported you
in everything that you do.

02:06.894 --> 02:10.162
Walking away from<i> Voltage</i>
was huge, Maddie.

02:10.164 --> 02:12.564
Walking away from that
could ruin my entire career.

02:12.566 --> 02:15.901
Walking away from SESU
could ruin my entire future!

02:15.903 --> 02:19.571
I have worked so hard
for this chance, Liv.

02:19.573 --> 02:21.340
Why can't you
just be happy for me?

02:21.342 --> 02:23.609
Fine! Go to California, Maddie,

02:23.611 --> 02:26.111
but don't expect me
to act like you didn't
betray me,

02:26.113 --> 02:27.379
because you did.

02:41.428 --> 02:45.497
You put a Parker Tunnel
in my bed?

02:46.534 --> 02:48.901
I thought I was in the attic.

02:50.804 --> 02:52.504

03:54.768 --> 03:57.202
I'm really disappointed.

03:57.204 --> 03:59.004
But as your dad,

03:59.006 --> 04:02.241
my little girl is playing
for the best program

04:02.243 --> 04:06.345
in the country!
Bam! What?

04:08.382 --> 04:10.616
Oh, Dad, I'm so relieved.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.553
Liv is actually so mad at me

04:14.555 --> 04:16.555
that she's not even
speaking to me.

04:16.557 --> 04:17.856
You know what?
I am gonna tell her

04:17.858 --> 04:20.192
that she needs
to talk this over with you.

04:20.194 --> 04:22.227
No, no, Mom, please stop.

04:22.229 --> 04:25.464
If Liv wants to make this right,
she has to apologize to me.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.733
It doesn't count
if you go up there,

04:27.735 --> 04:30.035
and you drag her down,
and you make her do it.

04:30.037 --> 04:33.438
Okay. This is
between you girls.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.874
I'm gonna stay out of it.

04:37.378 --> 04:40.545
Like I'm gonna stay out of that.
I never stay out of anything.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.483
Nope... nope.

04:44.485 --> 04:47.452
They have to work
this out themselves.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.558
A couple of years ago,
we discovered

04:53.560 --> 04:56.962
that Parker had constructed
a series of tunnels
under the house.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.964
We told him to fill those in.

04:58.966 --> 05:02.801
In retrospect, we probably
should've followed up on that.

05:06.407 --> 05:08.540
(rats squeaking)

05:09.943 --> 05:13.679
Oh, man, the rats
are biting today!

05:13.681 --> 05:17.649
Oh... no, no, he got away.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.919
Man, you've built
quite a sweet life
for yourself in Parker Hollow.

05:20.921 --> 05:25.590
Yeah, my tunnels
are an oasis from the cyclone
of blonde drama above.

05:27.428 --> 05:30.595
What is going on down here?

05:30.597 --> 05:31.997
No one's fishing for rats,

05:31.999 --> 05:34.099
if that's
what you're thinking, Mom.

05:34.101 --> 05:37.669
(gasps) Is that my missing
Thai cookbook?

05:37.671 --> 05:39.838
No, don't touch that!

05:41.442 --> 05:45.444
It's holding up
the whole house.

05:45.446 --> 05:46.812
Kind of exciting, no?

05:46.814 --> 05:50.716
No! All right, that's it,
the Parker Tunnels

05:50.718 --> 05:52.517
are officially closed.
Get out!

05:52.519 --> 05:54.553
Mom, but the muffins
are almost done.

05:54.555 --> 05:56.722
You have an oven
down here?

05:56.724 --> 05:58.323
-No.
-Never mind.

05:58.325 --> 05:59.458
We're leaving.

06:02.463 --> 06:04.262
What?

06:08.736 --> 06:10.736
They smell good.

06:13.674 --> 06:17.642
Ooh. Comfy chair.
Don't mind if I do.

06:18.879 --> 06:22.714
What's that sound?
Oh, right. No kids.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.750
Oh, Karen likey.

06:30.657 --> 06:32.391
Hey. Don't go
all Hollywood on me.

06:32.393 --> 06:34.760
Oh, not a chance,
Parker Pants.

06:34.762 --> 06:37.763
Oh. Aunt Dena
will take good care of you.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.564
Just like she did with Liv
when she was doing...

06:39.566 --> 06:42.067
<i>♪ Sing It Loud! ♪</i>

06:44.505 --> 06:48.473
And on that very sour note...
I will be leaving.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.714
I really thought
that she was gonna
come down and say goodbye.

06:55.716 --> 06:57.215
She's...
She's gonna come down.

07:00.721 --> 07:02.621
No. Mom, she won't.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.756
(car horn honking)

07:04.758 --> 07:07.359
Dad is waiting for me
out in the car, so...

07:07.361 --> 07:08.894
Bye, guys.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.829
-I'll help you out.
-Okay.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.368
-Love you.
-I love you.

07:16.370 --> 07:18.603
-I love you, Joe.
-Love you, dude.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.708
Okay, now I can meddle.

07:29.550 --> 07:32.717
Hey, Liv!

07:32.719 --> 07:33.752
How ya doing?

07:33.754 --> 07:35.720
Did Mom send you?

07:35.722 --> 07:38.290
No, of course not.

07:38.292 --> 07:40.759
Can't a brother
just check in to...

07:40.761 --> 07:44.863
"facilitate healing
between you and Maddie."

07:46.633 --> 07:50.502
Well, I am actually healing
just fine by getting rid
of every single trace

07:50.504 --> 07:52.604
of Maddie in this entire room.

07:52.606 --> 07:55.674
Whoa. Gonna be hard to...

07:55.676 --> 08:00.078
"turn the page on such
a corn relationship."

08:02.449 --> 08:04.282
What's a corn relationship?

08:04.284 --> 08:07.018
"Core."
Core... relationship.

08:08.522 --> 08:10.822
Come on, Joey,
I know Mom sent you.

08:10.824 --> 08:14.459
Okay, well,
everyone's worried
about you and Maddie.

08:14.461 --> 08:18.930
I mean, Liv, your best friend
moved to California and then
you didn't even say goodbye?

08:18.932 --> 08:21.333
I'm not talking to her
until she apologizes.

08:21.335 --> 08:24.536
I changed my entire life
for her, and then she bailed
on me, Joey.

08:24.538 --> 08:27.539
So you can stop
referring to her
as my best friend.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.877
Does this picture
mean nothing to you?

08:31.879 --> 08:35.814
Sisters by chance,
friends by choice.

08:35.816 --> 08:39.751
Powerful little words...
marginal artwork.

08:42.489 --> 08:45.757
Yeah. Sisters by chance...

08:47.828 --> 08:49.427
friends no more.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.433
(doorbell rings)

08:59.673 --> 09:02.307
Maddie! Hi!

09:02.309 --> 09:03.975
Aunt Dena, hi!

09:03.977 --> 09:05.176
How was your flight?

09:05.178 --> 09:08.647
Oh, it was actually
really great.
It-- whaaa?

09:08.649 --> 09:12.684
(ringing bells)

09:12.686 --> 09:15.520
Huh. What's happening?

09:15.522 --> 09:17.556
Oh, I'm getting rid
of any negative chi

09:17.558 --> 09:20.358
you may have picked up
on the plane at 30,000 feet.

09:20.360 --> 09:23.428
Bad chi means
bad happiness.

09:23.430 --> 09:27.499
Uh, Willow, this is Aunt Dena.
Aunt Dena, this is Willow.

09:27.501 --> 09:31.736
Willow! I'm loving
your blazing orange aura.

09:31.738 --> 09:34.839
Thank you!
I just had it touched up.

09:38.745 --> 09:42.180
Can I offer anyone
some spelt crackers
with mung bean spread?

09:42.182 --> 09:46.184
Yes! Please! Extra mung!

09:47.688 --> 09:50.789
I exit this room
the way I entered it--

09:50.791 --> 09:53.925
with peace... and harmony.

09:59.866 --> 10:04.636
Well, I guess it's time
to seal up the Parker Tunnels.

10:04.638 --> 10:07.973
This is a sad, sad day.

10:07.975 --> 10:09.908
Shall we go down
to Parker Hollow

10:09.910 --> 10:13.745
and have one last
baloney sandwich together?

10:13.747 --> 10:15.580
-Can we hold hands?
-No.

10:15.582 --> 10:19.217
Good. Yeah.
Yeah, it's not even like
I even really wanted to.

10:19.219 --> 10:22.487
-I just... (mutters)
-Fine, come on.

10:22.489 --> 10:24.489
Yay!

10:30.764 --> 10:34.299
Why did you stop, Parker?
I just got a face full
of your butt.

10:35.435 --> 10:37.168
-Look!
-(gasps)

10:42.609 --> 10:44.843
Oh. Hello, boys.

10:45.846 --> 10:49.314
What have you done
to Parker Hollow?

10:49.316 --> 10:51.216
(laughing)
You mean...

10:53.453 --> 10:54.853
Karen Kountry?

10:58.692 --> 11:01.793
You are so lucky
that you get to live
with such a cool aunt.

11:01.795 --> 11:04.029
I know. She's a blast.

11:04.031 --> 11:08.700
Though she does claim
she is a psychic healer.

11:11.038 --> 11:13.371
So, you know, if she finds out
that Liv and I are fighting,

11:13.373 --> 11:16.841
she's just gonna try
and get... all up
in my chakras.

11:16.843 --> 11:19.544
Which, I mean, I don't know
what chakras are,

11:19.546 --> 11:23.014
but I'm assuming
I don't want anybody
all up in them.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.884
So just, do me a favor,
just don't say anything.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.852
Okay.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.921
(gasps)
You're fighting with Liv.

11:32.059 --> 11:34.292
She is psychic!

11:34.294 --> 11:37.228
Did you have a vision?

11:38.398 --> 11:40.165
No, I could just hear you
from the kitchen.

11:40.167 --> 11:42.067
The house is really echo-y.

11:43.303 --> 11:46.971
But to my credit,
I did have an intuitive tingle.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.542
So, what is going on?

11:52.345 --> 11:55.847
They got into a big fight
because Liv gave up her show
for Maddie,

11:55.849 --> 11:58.083
and now she feels
like Maddie abandoned her.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.151
Because I want to go
to my dream school.

12:00.153 --> 12:03.054
But I'm not gonna talk to her
until she apologizes.

12:03.056 --> 12:06.091
But you two have always
been so close.

12:06.093 --> 12:08.359
Oh! Let me help you fix this.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.562
No. I mean,
Liv is an insensitive jerk,

12:10.564 --> 12:11.863
so there really
is no fixing this.

12:11.865 --> 12:13.515
We're probably never
gonna speak again,

12:13.516 --> 12:15.166
but everything's fine.
Do you wanna go to the beach?

12:17.003 --> 12:20.939
Okay. Everything Maddie
goes in the attic.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.242
What?

12:26.113 --> 12:29.447
Oh... I thought
this was the laundry room.

12:30.951 --> 12:33.017
These tunnels are so confusing.

12:34.888 --> 12:37.689
Are you packing up
Maddie's stuff?

12:37.691 --> 12:40.291
I knew I shouldn't have sent
Joey up here to talk with you.

12:40.293 --> 12:43.695
Okay, okay. Looks like
Mama's gotta fix this herself.

12:46.133 --> 12:49.467
I'm sorry, Mom,
you really can't fix this.

12:49.469 --> 12:52.470
Liv... sisters fight.

12:52.472 --> 12:55.106
Believe me, I know.

12:55.108 --> 12:58.042
But they need to find a way
to make up.

12:58.044 --> 13:00.612
We can make up
as soon as she apologizes,

13:00.614 --> 13:02.614
because I am not
the one who's wrong here.

13:02.616 --> 13:07.318
Okay, honey.
Sometimes you can be wrong
and right at the same time.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.789
Now, you need to ask yourself:
do you wanna be right?

13:10.791 --> 13:13.992
Or do you wanna get
your best friend back?

13:15.228 --> 13:18.129
I don't want her back.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.098
I'm really enjoying
having this whole place
to myself,

13:20.100 --> 13:23.134
and it's gonna be
even better once
all of her junk is gone.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.869
Is it junk?

13:25.906 --> 13:27.972
Or is it a lifetime
of memories?

13:34.080 --> 13:37.081
Today was super, super fun,
Aunt Dena.

13:37.083 --> 13:39.083
I do have
one question, though.

13:39.085 --> 13:42.821
If we're not really
gonna surf, why do we need
to carry the surfboards?

13:42.823 --> 13:46.591
Mmm. The answer is evident
if you look within.

13:48.261 --> 13:51.196
-Because we look super cool
carrying surfboards?
-Bingo!

13:51.198 --> 13:53.164
Oh, yes!

13:53.166 --> 13:55.266
I'm so LA.

13:55.268 --> 13:56.901
Practically a native.

13:58.205 --> 14:00.371
Well, back to my dorm room.

14:00.373 --> 14:04.442
When I tell my roomies
about today, they're
gonna be so jelly!

14:04.444 --> 14:07.645
-That's Cali
for "jealous."
-Oh.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.180
Bye.

14:10.450 --> 14:13.818
Well, you seem to be
doing okay without
talking to Liv.

14:13.820 --> 14:16.120
I guess I was wrong.

14:16.122 --> 14:20.024
I'm never wrong.
It's time for laid-back,

14:20.026 --> 14:23.127
free spirit Aunt Dena
to go old-school.

14:23.129 --> 14:24.996
Knock some sense into her.

14:24.998 --> 14:28.066
I got some great pics
of you on the beach.

14:29.169 --> 14:31.002
I'm gonna put these
in the scrapbook.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.470
What scrapbook?

14:32.472 --> 14:36.841
The scrapbook I'll use
to knock some sense into her.

14:36.843 --> 14:40.044
Liv was so excited
to move home
to be with you.

14:40.046 --> 14:42.881
She sent me updates
of all of your adventures,

14:42.883 --> 14:46.217
and I made a scrapbook.

14:46.219 --> 14:50.521
It seems like the last
three years you had
with Liv were pretty special.

14:50.523 --> 14:53.324
Go ahead and leaf through it.

14:53.326 --> 14:56.895
Maybe it'll...
help you remember
the good times.

14:58.064 --> 15:02.667
I am gonna go whip up
some seaweed smoothies
for dinner.

15:04.170 --> 15:06.638
I'm just kidding.
We're having meatloaf.
I'm not a monster.

16:47.307 --> 16:48.840
(sobs)

16:52.278 --> 16:55.113
-Oh, Liv!
-Mom.

16:55.115 --> 16:58.049
I made a really
horrible mistake,

16:58.051 --> 17:00.118
and I don't know
how to fix it.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.532
Maddie! Hey!

17:14.534 --> 17:18.236
Hey!
Look at you.

17:18.238 --> 17:22.073
Just... bongoing,
right, right there
on, on the floor.

17:23.410 --> 17:24.575
How did it go?

17:24.577 --> 17:27.145
Oh, our first practice?
It went so great.

17:27.147 --> 17:28.413
And now Willow
is gonna come over,

17:28.415 --> 17:31.315
and we are gonna
hike up to the Hollywood sign.

17:31.317 --> 17:34.252
You know that is not
what I meant.

17:34.254 --> 17:36.387
How did it go
when you called Liv?

17:36.389 --> 17:41.292
Oh. Um...
I did not call Liv.

17:42.228 --> 17:46.364
After your not-so-subtle
scrapbook trick,

17:46.366 --> 17:49.567
I really wanted to call her,
but I chickened out.

17:51.037 --> 17:54.672
I'm just not sure
what I could even say
to make everything right.

17:54.674 --> 17:57.241
Well, why don't you start
with hello?

17:57.243 --> 17:59.410
See where it goes from there?

17:59.412 --> 18:00.445
(cell phone beeps)

18:00.447 --> 18:03.881
Ooh! The sun is setting.

18:03.883 --> 18:07.085
I gotta get down to the beach
and bark at the seals.

18:08.021 --> 18:09.487
Aarf, aarf, aarf!

18:12.459 --> 18:14.625
That's "hello" in seal.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.499
(doorbell rings)

18:22.869 --> 18:24.102
Coming, Willow.

18:31.377 --> 18:32.944
Liv?

18:32.946 --> 18:35.446
Hello.

18:38.384 --> 18:41.486
These baloney sandwiches
just aren't as delicious

18:41.488 --> 18:44.322
without 20 feet of unstable dirt
above my head.

18:45.725 --> 18:48.326
No, they are not,
my good sir.

18:48.328 --> 18:51.162
(ethereal flute music plays)

18:52.232 --> 18:55.833
Is that Mom playing the flute
in my tunnels?

18:57.303 --> 18:59.637
This shall not stand.

18:59.639 --> 19:04.408
Oh, oh. I hear
a declaration coming on.

19:04.410 --> 19:07.645
If we can't have
the Parker Tunnels,

19:07.647 --> 19:10.681
no one will have
the Parker Tunnels!

19:10.683 --> 19:13.518
Boom! You killed
that declaration, son!

19:16.322 --> 19:18.256
We're gonna
finish our sandwiches

19:18.258 --> 19:19.590
before we exact our revenge,
though, right?

19:19.592 --> 19:21.025
Ah, cha.

19:27.634 --> 19:29.867
Liv, what you doing here?

19:29.869 --> 19:32.904
Well, I mean, you...
forgot this.

19:36.009 --> 19:38.342
You forgot your toothbrush too,
but I sort of figured

19:38.344 --> 19:39.577
that you could get
a new one of those--

19:41.614 --> 19:43.347
I missed you so much.

19:45.118 --> 19:46.884
Maddie...

19:46.886 --> 19:51.722
you just followed your heart,
and I'm so sorry that I got
so upset about that.

19:51.724 --> 19:55.359
I'm sorry.
I should've at least
talked to you

19:55.361 --> 19:56.894
before I just decided
to come out here.

19:56.896 --> 19:59.330
I mean, I didn't
even say goodbye to you.

19:59.332 --> 20:01.532
Okay, yeah, you win,
you were the bigger jerk.

20:03.369 --> 20:04.869
Thank you.

20:07.140 --> 20:10.208
-Do you forgive me?
-Liv, of course I forgive you.

20:10.210 --> 20:14.278
-Sisters by chance...
-Friends by choice.

20:18.818 --> 20:22.286
Wow. Those seals
were not in the mood.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.556
Liv!

20:25.558 --> 20:26.390
Hi!

20:29.762 --> 20:32.263
I had an intuitive tingle
you were gonna be here,

20:32.265 --> 20:35.566
but I didn't listen,
because I was being chased
by seals.

20:37.537 --> 20:40.404
Hey, um, is it cool
if I crash here
just for tonight,

20:40.406 --> 20:42.440
before my flight back
to Wisconsin tomorrow?

20:42.442 --> 20:43.774
Of course, sweetie.

20:43.776 --> 20:47.178
I have plenty of room.
Let me go make up a bed.

20:47.180 --> 20:51.082
I cannot wait to throw it
in your mom's face
that I fixed this!

20:53.286 --> 20:55.453
Oh! If you are only here
for one night,

20:55.455 --> 20:59.090
we have to go
to Matthew McConaughey's house
and play "Ding Dong Ditch."

20:59.092 --> 21:01.192
Ding Dong duh!

21:04.364 --> 21:07.632
Hey. I have a better idea.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.767
Oh, no, Maddie,
you have no idea,
it's so funny.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.435
We go to his house
and we hide in the bushes,

21:11.437 --> 21:13.070
and he comes out,
and he's like all confused,

21:13.072 --> 21:16.207
and he goes...
"All right, all right,
all right."

21:16.209 --> 21:17.775
It's so funny.

21:19.379 --> 21:21.712
No, I have a better idea
than you leaving tomorrow.

21:22.882 --> 21:24.148
Stay.

21:24.150 --> 21:25.549
What?

21:26.552 --> 21:29.754
You could stay.
I mean, you love Los Angeles.

21:29.756 --> 21:33.124
The only reason you moved back
to Stevens Point was for me,
and I'm here now.

21:33.126 --> 21:35.126
Just... stay.

21:35.128 --> 21:41.465
You know? You could
go to SESU. You could
act or you could sing.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.301
You know, you'd figure it out.

21:43.303 --> 21:45.503
I mean, we could
figure it out.

21:49.108 --> 21:51.475
-Okay.
-Seriously?

21:51.477 --> 21:53.544
Yeah, I'm totally serious.

21:55.181 --> 21:57.648
Liv and Maddie,
California style.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.851
Both:
All right, all right,
all right!

22:05.758 --> 22:09.493
Oh, time to get down
to Karen Kountry
for some "me" time.

22:14.934 --> 22:18.736
(laughs)
Trying to access
your precious tunnels, Mother?

22:19.872 --> 22:21.605
We sealed them.

22:22.675 --> 22:26.677
They came from the earth,
and to the earth
they shall return.

22:26.679 --> 22:29.547
-Here's your... Thai cookbook.
-(gasps)

22:29.549 --> 22:33.651
You moved that?
Munch, that's the only thing
holding up the house!

22:33.653 --> 22:39.390
Chillito, Parkito.
I replaced the pillar
with Mom's exercise ball.

22:39.392 --> 22:41.392
Well, what if that rolls away?

22:41.394 --> 22:45.930
Mom, relax. I braced it
with Dad's hedge clippers.

22:46.899 --> 22:49.700
(gasps)

22:49.702 --> 22:50.801
You know, now
when I say it out loud,

22:50.803 --> 22:52.737
it does sound
like a flawed plan.

23:00.079 --> 23:01.579
Run!

23:29.208 --> 23:30.841
(distant car alarms blare)

23:32.245 --> 23:35.079
(coughing)

23:39.752 --> 23:43.988
I am just gonna say it...
that was my bad.

23:46.359 --> 23:49.260
So... we all moved into
Aunt Dena's.

23:49.262 --> 23:51.529
And of course, there will be
no issues for me

23:51.531 --> 23:54.064
living with my...
little sister.

23:54.066 --> 23:57.368
And I already made friends
with a pelican.

23:57.370 --> 23:59.703
And I'm excited
about building tunnels

23:59.705 --> 24:00.704
in an active fault zone.

24:00.706 --> 24:02.940
No more tunnels!

24:02.942 --> 24:06.243
Fine. I shall
conquer the skies.

24:06.245 --> 24:08.612
Jet pack, here I come!

24:09.782 --> 24:13.384
Look out! The Rooneys
are taking over California.

24:13.386 --> 24:15.686
All:
Bam! What?

24:16.622 --> 24:18.456
Liv and Maddie:
<i>All right, all right,</i>
<i>all right!</i>
