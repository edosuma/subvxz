02:46.834 --> 02:47.500
Damn!

02:57.010 --> 02:59.262
Blast the hatch! Now!

03:00.389 --> 03:03.140
That experiment must not
get off this ship!

03:56.236 --> 03:57.486
Oh, hi.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.238
Bye.

04:04.369 --> 04:08.331
Oh, I gotta pass this test.
I gotta get an A.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.523
We interrupt this program
for a KING news flash.

04:34.691 --> 04:37.944
Authorities at the Crestridge Institute
for the criminally insane...

04:38.111 --> 04:40.655
...have requested
an all-points bullet...

04:50.499 --> 04:53.334
He's so dreamy.

04:53.502 --> 04:56.045
Oh, he's just the most.

04:56.213 --> 04:57.672
Who?

04:57.839 --> 04:58.881
Ray?

04:59.049 --> 05:01.092
They broke up.

05:01.259 --> 05:05.388
Oh, come on, Muffy.
The guy's a cop. He has no future.

05:05.555 --> 05:09.225
I mean,
wake up and smell the coffee, Muffy.

05:09.393 --> 05:10.393
What?

05:10.560 --> 05:13.229
Well, Pam told me, who else?

05:13.397 --> 05:18.150
Sure, she's right here next to me.
We are roommates, you know.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.153
What? Where?

05:22.823 --> 05:24.991
No, that was Friday night.

05:25.158 --> 05:28.577
You're such a gomer sometimes.

05:28.745 --> 05:31.497
Did you see
Plan 9 from Outer Space?

05:50.392 --> 05:56.522
Star light, star bright, first star I...

05:57.190 --> 06:00.526
Say,
which one is the brightest star?

06:00.694 --> 06:03.112
Hey, haven't you kids
heard the radio?

06:03.280 --> 06:05.656
There's some nutbar on the loose,
so I sugg...

06:06.950 --> 06:08.451
Pam?

06:09.578 --> 06:11.412
Hello, Ray.

06:16.084 --> 06:18.002
Just go home, will you?

06:18.170 --> 06:19.211
Just go home.

06:24.301 --> 06:26.552
You know that cop?

06:27.137 --> 06:30.848
He's just someone from my past.

06:33.143 --> 06:35.895
What about the brightest star,
anyway?

06:56.458 --> 06:58.084
Neato!

06:58.251 --> 06:59.627
I vote for that one.

07:14.184 --> 07:15.935
Are you sure this is a good idea?

07:16.103 --> 07:18.104
Come on, cool out, will you?

07:18.271 --> 07:20.397
I'm telling you,
it went down right over there.

07:20.565 --> 07:24.610
Oh, no, Johnny.
This place gives me the creeps.

07:46.716 --> 07:48.384
Johnny?

07:48.760 --> 07:50.511
You stay here.

07:53.098 --> 07:54.640
You're kidding, right?

08:15.662 --> 08:17.663
Another update
from the KING newsroom.

08:17.831 --> 08:21.000
Police continue the search
for a 35-year-old escapee...

08:21.168 --> 08:24.670
...from the Crestridge Mental Institute,
who, officials confirm...

08:24.880 --> 08:28.215
...killed four orderlies
in a brutal spree early tonight.

08:28.383 --> 08:31.677
Crestridge police warn the man
is armed with a large fire ax...

08:31.845 --> 08:34.471
...and is believed to be moving west
on Route 66...

08:34.639 --> 08:36.599
...toward
the Corman University area.

08:49.571 --> 08:51.113
Johnny?

09:12.093 --> 09:13.844
Johnny.

09:14.012 --> 09:16.972
Can we go back to the point now?

09:18.058 --> 09:21.936
I'll even let you fondle my breasts.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.960
Johnny.

09:46.127 --> 09:49.505
I'm getting lonely out here
by myself.

09:59.307 --> 10:12.653
Johnny.

10:36.928 --> 10:38.554
I'm depressed.

10:38.722 --> 10:39.722
Oh, will you cheer up?

10:39.889 --> 10:41.682
Come on, this is college life.

10:41.850 --> 10:44.643
You know, toilet paper in the trees,
spring is in the air...

10:44.811 --> 10:48.105
...a couple of bitchen guys
on the prowl for major league babes.

10:48.273 --> 10:51.358
Face it, J.C., we're dorks.
We're lameoids.

10:51.526 --> 10:54.153
My grandparents have sex
more than we do.

10:54.321 --> 10:57.990
Well, granted, but you talk
like that's a negative thing.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.326
Good point. I feel a lot better.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.161
Good, so do I.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.620
J.C., do me a favor.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.706
Anything, dude.
You got it, you know it.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.666
Don't try and cheer me up.

11:07.834 --> 11:10.419
Look, Chris, when you're depressed,
I'm depressed.

11:10.587 --> 11:13.130
And I don't like being depressed.
It's, well, you know...

11:13.298 --> 11:14.715
- Depressing?
- Depressing, yeah.

11:14.883 --> 11:18.761
So do me a favor, okay, bud?
Cut out this being depressed shit.

11:18.928 --> 11:21.555
Chris, this is me talking here.
I'm your bud. I love you.

11:21.723 --> 11:24.933
We have a bond, a warmth,
a communication.

11:43.119 --> 11:45.120
Who's that?

11:46.915 --> 11:49.041
- Who's what?
- Her. The vision.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.502
- The angel, the goddess.
- The one with the hogans?

11:51.669 --> 11:53.045
Yeah, who is she?

11:53.213 --> 11:55.506
I think that's the Morton Salt girl.

11:55.673 --> 11:56.965
How the hell should I know?

11:57.133 --> 11:59.385
Hey, you, honey. Toots, yo.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.970
Yeah, what's your name?

12:02.138 --> 12:05.307
J.C., remind me
to kill you sometime.

12:05.475 --> 12:06.809
Kill me sometime, huh?

12:09.145 --> 12:10.270
Great.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.314
Now what do I do?

12:12.482 --> 12:16.819
Well, you could always just stand here
like an idiot and not do anything.

12:16.986 --> 12:19.113
Kidding, joke, levity, humor.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.989
Shit.
She's going in the Beta house.

12:21.157 --> 12:22.324
Oh, that bitch.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.076
I hate the Betas.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.036
Look, do you wanna meet her
or what?

12:26.204 --> 12:27.746
I wanna marry her.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.706
I hate to break this to you, bud.

12:29.874 --> 12:32.626
It's gonna be quite a blow,
but you have to meet her first.

12:32.794 --> 12:36.171
I know it's a hassle, but hey,
I don't make up the rules, pal.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.046
Bingo.

13:18.214 --> 13:19.631
- Where?
- One o'clock.

13:26.723 --> 13:29.933
Great. She's with a guy.

13:30.643 --> 13:34.188
Yeah, but look at him.
I mean, the guy's a bozo.

13:34.355 --> 13:35.939
He's the missing link.

13:36.107 --> 13:38.692
Chris, the man
has one continuous eyebrow.

13:38.860 --> 13:40.569
Yeah, well, he's also got her.

13:40.737 --> 13:42.029
It's all positive thinking.

13:42.197 --> 13:44.740
Now, watch this.
J.C.'s going in for the main event.

13:44.908 --> 13:46.825
Final countdown, third and 10.

13:46.993 --> 13:50.329
This is gonna be beautiful.
You'll love this.

13:52.540 --> 13:55.334
So are you gonna come to the game
with me sometime?

13:55.502 --> 13:56.793
- Maybe.
- Sure, it'd be great.

13:56.961 --> 13:59.421
Sit on the bench
and watch them play, it'd be great.

13:59.589 --> 14:00.756
Love to have you there.

14:00.924 --> 14:02.216
Sounds like fun.

14:02.383 --> 14:03.800
Yeah.

14:04.135 --> 14:05.552
Tiger.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.264
Excuse me, what's his name?

14:11.434 --> 14:12.851
Steve.

14:13.019 --> 14:15.604
Steve, bud, how's it going?

14:15.772 --> 14:18.273
I think there
was a telephone call for you inside.

14:19.901 --> 14:21.693
Thanks, dude.

14:21.861 --> 14:22.945
Later, Cindy.

14:23.112 --> 14:25.531
- Bye.
- No problem.

14:27.992 --> 14:30.244
Cindy. Cindy what?

14:31.454 --> 14:34.081
There isn't really a phone call for him,
is there?

14:34.582 --> 14:38.293
Cynthia, my time is limited.

14:38.461 --> 14:40.837
Much like the intellect of Steve.

14:41.005 --> 14:43.215
You see
that attractive gentleman over there...

14:43.383 --> 14:45.467
...by the ale dispenser?

14:48.596 --> 14:51.723
Well, I'm his agent, and it is vital
that I obtain this information.

14:51.891 --> 14:55.811
You see, the fate of the entire
free world hangs in the balance.

14:56.980 --> 14:58.981
Cynthia Cronenberg.

14:59.691 --> 15:02.484
- And why didn't he ask me himself?
- Tell him that.

15:04.279 --> 15:08.657
- I would.
- But you have a boyfriend?

15:11.953 --> 15:13.829
Hey, you're cruising, man.

15:13.997 --> 15:15.872
There was no call for me.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.625
Silly me, I don't understand
how that could've happened.

15:18.793 --> 15:20.377
What was your name again? Chad?

15:20.837 --> 15:22.546
Biff? Riff?

15:22.714 --> 15:25.549
Steve.
And I don't think you're very funny.

15:26.509 --> 15:27.634
Don't tell me.

15:27.802 --> 15:30.470
About as funny as a crutch?

15:30.930 --> 15:32.347
Get it?

15:44.444 --> 15:46.194
Give me.
Talk, squeal, spill the beans.

15:46.362 --> 15:48.196
Chill out. All right.

15:48.364 --> 15:50.490
Okay, she knows her name
for starters.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.784
Which for a sorority girl
is pretty impressive.

15:52.952 --> 15:53.994
Cut to the chase.

15:54.162 --> 15:55.621
Does she have a boyfriend?

15:56.831 --> 15:59.916
She didn't say, but I don't think so.

16:00.084 --> 16:02.294
This is it.

16:02.754 --> 16:03.962
I think...

16:04.130 --> 16:06.173
I think
I can possibly be in love here.

16:06.341 --> 16:10.719
You realize there's one way this girl
is ever gonna take you seriously.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.679
Right.

16:12.847 --> 16:14.222
If I belong to a frat.

16:14.390 --> 16:15.766
Preferably this one.

16:16.476 --> 16:19.269
I was thinking more
along the lines of talking to her.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.564
J.C.

16:23.733 --> 16:26.777
Bud, you're so naive.

16:26.944 --> 16:28.403
Yeah.

16:33.868 --> 16:36.161
Now, let me get this straight.

16:37.413 --> 16:40.916
You guys wanna pledge the Betas?

16:41.918 --> 16:43.835
That's right.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.464
Well, now...

16:48.758 --> 16:52.135
...what makes you guys think
you're Beta material?

16:56.265 --> 16:58.100
I mean, we've pretty much found...

16:58.267 --> 17:01.103
...most of the guys we need
to fill the roster this semester.

17:01.270 --> 17:05.107
You'd have
to have something special to offer.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.984
How about money? Moolah, dough.

17:09.153 --> 17:11.279
The old green stuff, fun ticket.

17:11.446 --> 17:13.031
Cabbage, the old dollar sign.

17:13.199 --> 17:14.366
Come on, killer-roo.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.492
I'm talking about the dinars,
yens, rupee...

17:16.661 --> 17:17.703
Quiet already.

17:17.869 --> 17:19.829
Gentlemen...

17:20.623 --> 17:24.667
...the brothers and I
can't make any promises at this point.

17:24.836 --> 17:27.253
But I do have a proposal.

17:29.799 --> 17:34.469
If you guys were willing to perform...

17:34.637 --> 17:38.598
...a little act of devotion...

17:39.892 --> 17:44.813
...some task that would prove
the sincerity of your feelings...

17:44.981 --> 17:47.065
...toward this organization.

17:47.233 --> 17:50.986
We don't have to have sex
with a farm animal, do we?

17:52.155 --> 17:57.909
Interesting suggestion, but no.

17:58.786 --> 18:02.164
We had something...

18:02.331 --> 18:05.584
...a little more challenging in mind.

18:07.503 --> 18:11.173
Look, at least we don't have
to have sex with a farm animal.

18:11.340 --> 18:14.009
Hey, you might like it.
You wouldn't want Cynthia anymore.

18:14.177 --> 18:16.678
- That's not funny.
- Really, I'm serious.

18:16.846 --> 18:17.888
Shut up.

18:18.848 --> 18:21.641
Brother Brad,
if these guys pull this off...

18:21.809 --> 18:23.769
...are we really gonna let them in?

18:24.854 --> 18:26.855
Get serious.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.618
Babe, where you been?

18:40.203 --> 18:43.246
Oh, rush stuff.

19:11.234 --> 19:13.068
Goddamn it.

19:23.454 --> 19:25.580
Great, I know that number.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.708
Rudy. Hi, how you doing?

19:29.085 --> 19:34.256
Listen, I can't remember that last digit
to the stupid security card.

19:34.423 --> 19:36.842
Well, you need the digit
to get in the door.

19:37.009 --> 19:40.720
Rudy, just, could you look for it?
I think it's in my notebook.

19:40.888 --> 19:42.097
Yeah.

19:42.265 --> 19:44.808
Yeah, on the desk, yeah. I'll wait.

19:44.976 --> 19:46.893
Appreciate it, Rudy.

19:54.402 --> 19:56.194
Why can't they just have a sign?

19:56.362 --> 19:57.946
Oh, a sign? That's good.

19:58.114 --> 19:59.489
What do you want it to say?

19:59.657 --> 20:02.450
"Corpses for use
in wacky fraternity pranks"?

20:02.618 --> 20:03.952
Morgue or something.

20:04.120 --> 20:07.706
Morgue? You're pretty clever.
A little arrow or something?

20:12.295 --> 20:15.005
Come on.
It's gotta be around here some...

20:15.172 --> 20:17.007
What the hell are you doing?

20:19.594 --> 20:20.844
What the hell did you do?

20:21.596 --> 20:24.306
I don't know. Come on.

20:24.974 --> 20:26.558
You're kidding, right?

20:26.726 --> 20:28.059
All right.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.186
No, not the blue notebook.

20:30.354 --> 20:31.396
The red one.

20:31.981 --> 20:33.815
This gives me the creeps.

20:33.983 --> 20:35.817
Hey, how about looking
for the lights?

20:35.985 --> 20:38.445
How can I look for the lights?
I can't see anything.

20:38.613 --> 20:39.988
Well, use your hands.

20:40.156 --> 20:42.198
Hey, better yet,
use your whale radar.

20:42.366 --> 20:45.118
You are so weird.

20:47.204 --> 20:48.955
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

20:49.123 --> 20:51.708
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

21:00.468 --> 21:02.719
Think it's taking
the Lord's name in vain to say:

21:02.887 --> 21:06.389
"Oh, my God" a whole bunch
of times really fast like that?

21:06.557 --> 21:07.849
I believe you're allowed...

21:08.017 --> 21:10.810
...to break the commandments
in certain situations.

21:10.978 --> 21:13.104
How about getting the shit
scared out of you...

21:13.272 --> 21:16.942
...by a creepy, scary dead guy
in a refrigerated coffin?

21:17.360 --> 21:18.902
Are you sure he's dead?

21:19.070 --> 21:20.153
Well, I mean...

21:20.321 --> 21:24.658
...l'm pretty sure we could safely say
he's not well, Chris.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.743
- I wonder who he is.
- Walt Disney.

21:26.911 --> 21:29.245
How the hell should I know?
Let's get out of here.

21:29.413 --> 21:30.830
How long has he been here?

21:30.998 --> 21:34.459
What am I, a tour guide?
The guy's sealed up. Let's go.

21:35.586 --> 21:36.878
Wait a minute.

21:37.338 --> 21:39.881
For what? The cops?

21:40.174 --> 21:42.509
J.C., our stupid mission
is to find a cadaver...

21:42.677 --> 21:44.886
...and dump it on the front
of the P.O.G. House.

21:45.054 --> 21:47.180
This guy's obviously
part of some experiment...

21:47.348 --> 21:48.765
...so let's get out of here.

21:48.933 --> 21:53.103
I don't see any other handy
takeout corpses around here, do you?

21:55.398 --> 21:56.731
Wait a second.

21:56.899 --> 21:59.275
"Cryogenic stasis system."

21:59.443 --> 22:01.695
Will you come on?

22:06.075 --> 22:07.617
You really didn't do that.

22:07.785 --> 22:11.079
Cryogenics?

22:11.247 --> 22:13.415
Chris, do you realize what this is?

22:13.582 --> 22:15.417
You heard of freeze-dried coffee,
right?

22:15.584 --> 22:18.545
Well, this is like a freeze-dried human.
A corpsicle.

22:19.213 --> 22:21.673
- You mean like suspended animation?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:21.841 --> 22:24.926
It's like you take someone while
they're alive and you freeze them.

22:25.094 --> 22:28.013
Then you thaw them out
a hundred years later like a TV dinner.

22:28.180 --> 22:31.599
We are talking
total science-fiction here.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.687
Disengage.

22:36.981 --> 22:38.023
No, wait.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.607
That's it, yes, bingo.

22:39.775 --> 22:41.693
I love you, Rudy. Thank you.

23:09.638 --> 23:11.389
- Is he heavy?
- Yeah.

23:11.557 --> 23:13.308
Is he cold?

23:19.106 --> 23:21.775
Think you'll be able to carry him
all the way back?

23:28.991 --> 23:30.492
Hey!

24:01.440 --> 24:03.149
Oh, my God.

24:22.128 --> 24:23.711
Great.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.381
Now what?

24:26.757 --> 24:30.009
Okay. How about we get
a couple of machine guns, right?

24:30.177 --> 24:32.262
And we blow the windows
out of the joint.

24:32.429 --> 24:35.890
And we yell, "Come on in and get me,
you dirty coppers."

24:36.058 --> 24:39.144
I mean,
everything's a joke to you tonight.

24:39.562 --> 24:41.896
Hey, fuck you, Chris.

24:42.857 --> 24:44.524
Look, every single day...

24:44.692 --> 24:47.152
...I put up with your moaning
about what's-her-name...

24:47.319 --> 24:49.279
...and how you wish
you could fall in love.

24:49.446 --> 24:51.865
But you're too chickenshit
to do anything about it.

24:52.032 --> 24:53.908
And then
this Cynthia girl comes along.

24:54.076 --> 24:56.494
Dream girl, 2001.

24:56.662 --> 25:00.081
I say to myself, "What the hell,
I'm sure as hell never gonna get laid...

25:00.249 --> 25:02.417
...so I might as well
help out my best friend."

25:02.585 --> 25:04.419
And then you say, "J.C., help.

25:04.587 --> 25:07.547
We gotta join the fraternity
so she'll give me the time of day."

25:07.715 --> 25:09.883
And I say,
"What the hell, you gotta do it."

25:10.050 --> 25:11.092
And what do I do?

25:11.260 --> 25:14.679
I bust my ass to help you
and you get chickenshit again.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.931
And I push and I push
and I don't give up.

25:17.099 --> 25:18.141
And why? Why?

25:18.309 --> 25:20.185
You don't even know.
You don't even care.

25:20.352 --> 25:23.354
Because it's important to me
that you're happy, is that so crazy?

25:23.522 --> 25:26.900
And we gotta act like jerks
and get in trouble in order to do that.

25:27.067 --> 25:29.652
It's better than acting like jerks
for no reason, right?

25:29.820 --> 25:31.279
So yeah, everything is a joke.

25:31.447 --> 25:34.449
It's hilarious,
because if you take it seriously...

25:34.617 --> 25:38.995
...you just get depressed
all the time like you are. So fuck you.

25:43.292 --> 25:46.044
- Yeah, well, fuck you too.
- You try it.

25:46.212 --> 25:47.879
- If you'd let me.
- You'd want me to.

25:48.297 --> 25:51.257
- You wish.
- Are we done?

25:52.426 --> 25:54.427
I'm sorry I was an asshole.

25:57.681 --> 26:00.350
If you weren't such an asshole,
even girls might like you.

26:02.645 --> 26:04.854
Hey, throw me that pillow, will you?

27:14.758 --> 27:16.426
Freeze!

27:35.988 --> 27:37.405
Thrill me.

27:37.573 --> 27:38.656
Detective Cameron?

27:38.824 --> 27:40.908
No, Bozo the Clown.

27:42.202 --> 27:45.496
We had a call
from University Med Center.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.915
Some experimental lab
has been broken into.

28:07.728 --> 28:09.604
Detective Cameron?

28:10.147 --> 28:11.564
No.

28:11.732 --> 28:15.610
Bullwinkle Moose. Thrill me.

28:15.778 --> 28:17.278
Hey, Ray.

28:18.655 --> 28:21.991
You're looking
at your actual cryogenics lab.

28:22.159 --> 28:26.162
They've had some kid's body
on ice here since 1959.

28:27.164 --> 28:30.583
What is this,
a homicide or a bad B movie?

28:31.460 --> 28:32.460
What's that?

28:32.628 --> 28:34.003
Was a grad student.

28:34.171 --> 28:35.880
Lab technician.

28:36.048 --> 28:38.257
He was scheduled to work here
this evening.

28:38.425 --> 28:40.968
Looks like he worked
a little too hard, huh?

28:41.136 --> 28:44.430
I suppose Rip Van Winkle
will be the other body. Where is it?

28:44.598 --> 28:47.225
The other body isn't here, sir.

28:49.103 --> 28:51.771
What, did he have a date?
What do you mean it isn't here?

28:51.939 --> 28:53.981
The coroner... Jake, did you take it?

28:54.149 --> 28:56.025
I just got here.

28:56.193 --> 28:58.319
I'm confused.
I was told there were two bodies.

28:58.487 --> 29:00.655
- Raimi.
- Yes, sir?

29:00.823 --> 29:03.658
First, knock off the "yes, sir" shit.

29:03.992 --> 29:06.661
Second, since when does
a desk sergeant show up on a call?

29:06.829 --> 29:08.704
Third,
you told me there were two bodies.

29:08.872 --> 29:11.541
Now, I only see the one.
You do know the difference?

29:11.708 --> 29:13.793
It wasn't on the sergeant exam
or anything...

29:13.961 --> 29:16.087
...but if you use your fingers,
it's real easy.

29:16.255 --> 29:19.132
See? One, two.

29:19.299 --> 29:20.800
- Piece of cake.
- Yes, sir.

29:20.968 --> 29:24.679
Well, there were two bodies, but there
was a dispatch problem, you know.

29:24.847 --> 29:25.847
Where were you guys?

29:26.014 --> 29:28.933
Well, sir,
there was a dispatch problem, sir.

29:29.101 --> 29:30.184
A dispatch problem.

29:30.352 --> 29:33.646
Anyway, look, I came down
and met the night janitor.

29:33.814 --> 29:36.232
And got a statement, of course.

29:39.361 --> 29:41.112
This shit is getting old real fast.

29:41.280 --> 29:44.198
I was awakened out of a real
pleasant dream to come down here.

29:44.366 --> 29:47.869
Straighten it out or am I gonna play
poo patrol with your night stick?

29:48.036 --> 29:49.078
I screwed up.

29:49.246 --> 29:51.998
I sent two rookies down here
on a case like this...

29:52.166 --> 29:55.918
...and at some point,
they both went to the...

29:56.503 --> 29:58.629
- They went to the bathroom.
- That's fine, fine.

29:58.797 --> 30:02.216
Candy-assed, but fine.
There's just one minor problem.

30:02.384 --> 30:04.802
Corpses that have been dead
for 27 years...

30:04.970 --> 30:07.847
...do not get up
and go for a walk by themselves!

30:20.527 --> 30:23.237
Sorry we had to make it
an early night, babe...

30:23.405 --> 30:27.283
...but we've got some serious
pledge humiliation to deal with.

31:06.114 --> 31:07.114
Prez?

31:07.282 --> 31:10.826
Lori told me to ask you if I can store
these in the house till Monday. Okay?

31:10.994 --> 31:12.161
Well, what are they?

31:13.121 --> 31:16.832
Well, they're kind of brains
for our bio class.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.125
We have to dissect them.

31:18.293 --> 31:20.628
Wait, human brains?

31:20.796 --> 31:21.921
How about the basement?

31:22.673 --> 31:24.131
Sure.

31:24.299 --> 31:26.926
I just don't want them up here.

33:02.731 --> 33:04.565
Hi, Gordon. Hi, sweetie.

33:04.733 --> 33:07.276
Did you come to help me study
or what, huh?

33:07.444 --> 33:09.195
Where have you been, huh?

34:54.885 --> 34:57.511
- Let's go, let's go.
- Go back. Come along, men.

35:27.751 --> 35:29.543
Caucasian.

35:30.128 --> 35:32.505
Unusual pallor to the complexion...

35:32.672 --> 35:34.548
...what's left of it.

35:37.219 --> 35:38.886
This that body
you were looking for?

35:39.596 --> 35:41.096
Thrill me.

35:48.104 --> 35:50.815
Jesus Christ.

36:03.912 --> 36:05.955
What's this supposed to be?

36:06.665 --> 36:09.542
It's supposed to be
the housemother's cottage.

36:38.572 --> 36:41.615
What you thinking, Ray?
Knock it off.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.912
Did that look to you like it...?

36:47.414 --> 36:49.957
Like it could've been done
with an ax?

36:50.125 --> 36:52.126
I said stop it.

36:53.253 --> 36:57.923
That psycho disappeared
27 years ago and you know it.

36:58.425 --> 37:02.678
Do you get off on living in the past?

37:06.808 --> 37:09.518
- Get him up. Yeah, all right.
- Are you ready?

37:09.686 --> 37:10.728
Watch it.

37:10.896 --> 37:14.148
Now, stay back, girls.
You don't wanna see this.

37:27.412 --> 37:28.662
Oh, right.

37:28.830 --> 37:30.497
She was. She was blond.

37:30.665 --> 37:33.208
She had on a blue sweater.
You didn't see her?

37:33.376 --> 37:34.627
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

37:34.794 --> 37:36.211
She was checking.

37:49.351 --> 37:52.144
That was not too cool, bros.

37:53.521 --> 37:56.398
- Hi, Brad.
- Okay, so we put you up to it.

37:56.566 --> 37:59.193
But we said
the Phi Omega Gamma house...

37:59.361 --> 38:00.819
...not the Kappa Delta sorority.

38:00.987 --> 38:03.197
Do you know the difference?

38:03.949 --> 38:05.532
It's all Greek to me.

38:08.203 --> 38:10.120
That was a little joke. I was kidding.

38:10.288 --> 38:13.415
A lot of girls were seriously freaked out
last night because of you.

38:13.917 --> 38:17.503
Wait a second, okay?
Listen, Brother Bratskeller.

38:17.671 --> 38:21.340
A, that whole stunt
was your Nobel Prize-winning idea...

38:21.508 --> 38:23.258
...and B, we didn't even pull it off.

38:23.426 --> 38:25.177
We chickened out, okay?

38:25.345 --> 38:29.556
So why don't you just get off our case
and go practice goose-stepping?

38:32.686 --> 38:33.936
Brad, stop.

38:37.732 --> 38:39.608
What a jerk.

38:42.737 --> 38:44.655
Sorry, dorks.

38:44.823 --> 38:46.907
Don't take it personal.

38:48.952 --> 38:50.536
Coming, babe?

39:10.640 --> 39:12.266
I got it.

39:13.768 --> 39:15.686
I'm really sorry.

39:16.604 --> 39:17.771
It's not your fault.

39:18.148 --> 39:20.733
We didn't do it. We really didn't.

39:20.900 --> 39:22.943
I believe you.

39:24.696 --> 39:27.406
For the record,
this is Cynthia Cronenberg.

39:28.992 --> 39:30.034
And we're...

39:30.201 --> 39:32.578
Christopher Romero
and James Carpenter Hooper?

39:34.330 --> 39:36.790
Landis, Homicide.

39:39.127 --> 39:41.086
Well, well, well.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.048
If it isn't Spanky and Alfalfa.

39:44.215 --> 39:46.216
Either of you guys
recognize Mr. Miner here?

39:48.053 --> 39:50.512
Well, he recognizes you.

39:51.056 --> 39:53.182
It seems Mr. Miner here
is the night janitor...

39:53.349 --> 39:54.850
...at the University Med Center.

39:55.810 --> 39:58.395
He says he saw you guys
running out of there last night.

39:58.563 --> 40:00.647
Forty miles an hour.

40:00.815 --> 40:03.233
Screaming like banshees.

40:03.401 --> 40:04.818
Care to comment?

40:09.783 --> 40:11.533
Okay.

40:11.993 --> 40:14.161
Seems we also found
a headless body...

40:14.329 --> 40:16.705
...out in front
of the Kappa Delta house last night.

40:19.459 --> 40:22.836
A body that came
from a lab in the basement...

40:23.004 --> 40:25.214
...of the very medical center...

40:25.381 --> 40:28.383
...that Mr. Miner saw you
running out of at 40 miles an hour.

40:29.010 --> 40:30.886
Don't forget
screaming like banshees.

40:32.097 --> 40:34.515
Sounds like a pledge prank to me.

40:34.682 --> 40:38.102
A sick, twisted, psychotic,
demented, deranged pledge prank.

40:38.269 --> 40:40.395
But possibly,
just possibly in the ball park...

40:40.563 --> 40:43.524
...of what you might call
your collegiate tomfoolery.

40:43.691 --> 40:45.067
You guys care to comment?

40:45.819 --> 40:47.486
- Well...
- Captain.

40:48.029 --> 40:52.199
Detective, I mean,
we're not your fraternity types.

40:52.367 --> 40:54.368
I personally
would rather have my brains...

40:54.536 --> 40:57.538
...invaded by creatures from space
than pledge a fraternity.

40:57.705 --> 40:59.998
He's lying. We did it.

41:01.709 --> 41:04.461
- Well, the Betas...
- The Betas.

41:04.629 --> 41:06.547
The Betas.
Well, that explains everything.

41:06.714 --> 41:08.841
The Betas told us to find a body...

41:09.008 --> 41:11.260
...and dump it on the steps
of another fraternity.

41:11.427 --> 41:17.307
Well, we got into the lab
and we got the body out of this thing.

41:17.725 --> 41:19.893
And then we chickened out
and ran away.

41:20.061 --> 41:21.645
At 40 miles an hour.

41:21.813 --> 41:24.189
Screaming like banshees.

41:26.484 --> 41:28.235
It was a nervous response.

41:28.403 --> 41:30.571
- He means the body.
- The body?

41:30.738 --> 41:33.574
It twitched. Its eyes opened.

41:33.741 --> 41:36.702
- I don't know, it spazzed out.
- Spazzed out. Totally.

41:36.870 --> 41:40.372
But I swear to God,
we did not move it from that lab.

41:40.540 --> 41:41.915
And we sure the hell...

41:42.083 --> 41:45.043
...I mean, heck,
didn't damage it in any way.

41:45.211 --> 41:49.256
And even if we did, Mr. Miner here
would've seen us, wouldn't he?

41:50.216 --> 41:53.218
Screaming like banshees.

42:36.638 --> 42:37.971
Yeah, see you tomorrow.

42:51.819 --> 42:54.988
Screaming like banshees.

43:30.984 --> 43:32.025
Kappa Delta.

43:32.193 --> 43:33.944
Is Cindy Cronenberg there?

43:34.112 --> 43:35.445
Just a minute.

43:35.613 --> 43:37.656
Cindy!

43:38.533 --> 43:40.075
Karen?

43:42.036 --> 43:43.912
Has anybody told her about the cat?

43:44.080 --> 43:45.414
It'd break her heart.

43:45.581 --> 43:47.207
- Hi.
- Hi.

43:48.710 --> 43:50.794
Thanks, cutie.

43:53.381 --> 43:55.007
Hello?

43:55.883 --> 43:58.010
Hey, babe. It's the Bradster.

43:58.469 --> 44:00.637
- Listen, about...
- Brad...

44:02.056 --> 44:04.224
...I don't think
I wanna talk to you right now.

44:04.392 --> 44:07.352
Hey, hey, lighten up.

44:07.520 --> 44:09.521
It's about those chuckle-heads,
isn't it?

44:14.235 --> 44:17.571
I mean, it'd be one thing
if you planned to pledge them.

44:17.739 --> 44:19.781
Have a cow about it,
why don't you?

44:20.158 --> 44:22.075
If I knew you were
gonna pull a downer...

44:22.243 --> 44:24.077
...I never even would've told you.

44:24.245 --> 44:27.998
But that's what I get for going
with a fucking psych major, isn't it?

44:48.853 --> 44:50.354
Gordon.

44:56.778 --> 44:59.321
Hi, sweetie. Hi, Gordon.

45:42.990 --> 45:44.533
Thrill me.

45:49.997 --> 45:51.873
Wonderful.

45:52.500 --> 45:54.126
How do you want me
to write this up?

45:54.293 --> 45:56.044
As just a homicide?

46:25.199 --> 46:26.741
Hi.

46:27.660 --> 46:28.869
Hi, hi.

46:29.495 --> 46:33.832
I looked you guys up in the student
directory. I hope you don't mind.

46:34.000 --> 46:37.210
Oh, not at all,
because we were just doing...

46:37.378 --> 46:40.130
I was about to take a shower
and then just...

46:41.382 --> 46:43.592
How's it going?
Wanna come in or just...?

46:44.051 --> 46:47.471
Actually, would a walk
be out of the question?

46:53.811 --> 46:56.146
I know they buried him.

46:56.481 --> 46:58.148
I saw the grave myself.

46:58.316 --> 47:03.320
This is excellent.
Night of the Living Dead Cat.

47:04.906 --> 47:08.074
Look, maybe the girl was on drugs.

47:08.242 --> 47:11.244
You know,
studying can get to you after a while.

47:13.581 --> 47:17.459
Sounds like there's a dance tonight,
the Student Union.

47:18.127 --> 47:20.170
And that guy's body?

47:20.338 --> 47:22.422
The one from the lab?

47:22.590 --> 47:25.592
It came to my window, you guys.

47:25.760 --> 47:27.886
I swear to God.

47:32.266 --> 47:34.851
I thought you'd understand.

47:35.603 --> 47:41.441
I mean, I didn't know who else
to come and talk to about it.

47:42.652 --> 47:46.571
I do understand. We do understand.

47:47.532 --> 47:49.824
I'm so confused.

47:56.040 --> 47:57.082
Listen, you guys.

47:57.250 --> 47:59.334
I really have to use
the nearest facilities...

47:59.502 --> 48:02.796
...so I'll be right back, okay?

48:05.758 --> 48:07.759
All right, go for it, partner.

48:07.927 --> 48:10.428
I mean, she's misplaced
her marble collection...

48:10.596 --> 48:12.097
...but definitely go for it.

48:12.265 --> 48:18.186
Chris, if I tell you something,
you promise to believe me?

48:19.647 --> 48:20.855
Of course.

48:22.817 --> 48:24.859
I think...

48:25.778 --> 48:28.446
...it was a zombie.

48:29.031 --> 48:32.367
And its head exploded...

48:32.535 --> 48:39.040
...and things like slugs
or something spilled out.

48:40.710 --> 48:42.711
Okay.

48:45.131 --> 48:47.549
Maybe I should walk you home.

49:06.110 --> 49:08.194
What about J.C.?

49:08.362 --> 49:11.823
I have a feeling
he went back to the dorms.

50:17.598 --> 50:19.307
Oh, my God.

50:23.104 --> 50:24.896
Oh, shit.

50:26.649 --> 50:28.608
Oh, my God.

50:45.793 --> 50:47.460
Shit.

50:48.254 --> 50:49.671
What the hell was that?

51:11.986 --> 51:13.862
Light.

51:14.029 --> 51:16.156
Come on. Come on.

51:16.323 --> 51:17.949
Okay.

51:22.037 --> 51:23.830
Come on.

51:49.857 --> 51:51.816
Oh, my God.

52:20.471 --> 52:22.388
I feel really stupid.

52:24.225 --> 52:25.475
I don't know.

52:25.643 --> 52:28.686
Maybe I'm going crazy
or something.

52:29.021 --> 52:32.857
Listen,
there's a formal tomorrow night...

52:33.025 --> 52:37.612
...and will you go with me?

52:39.240 --> 52:41.658
What? Really?

52:43.911 --> 52:46.204
Yeah, but what about Brad?

52:46.372 --> 52:47.705
Brad's an asshole.

52:47.873 --> 52:52.085
I know that, but aren't you guys...?

52:52.253 --> 52:54.671
Tomorrow night, okay?

52:58.050 --> 53:00.552
No more weird stuff.

53:00.719 --> 53:02.262
Thanks, Chris.

53:02.429 --> 53:03.972
Good night.

53:21.240 --> 53:25.326
Zombies, exploding heads...

53:25.953 --> 53:31.624
...creepy-crawlies
and a date for the formal.

53:32.167 --> 53:33.793
This is classic, Spanky.

53:39.425 --> 53:41.634
Tell me something, Spanky.

53:42.761 --> 53:45.054
Do you have
a high school sweetheart?

53:47.349 --> 53:48.391
Maybe.

53:50.853 --> 53:53.479
Well, whatever happened to her?

53:53.856 --> 53:55.815
I don't know, I blew it.

53:55.983 --> 53:58.192
She decided we didn't ever need
to talk again...

53:58.360 --> 54:00.320
...and went on with her life, I guess.

54:00.487 --> 54:02.238
Why?

54:02.406 --> 54:04.657
I had a high school sweetheart.

54:04.825 --> 54:06.326
So? What happened to her?

54:07.161 --> 54:08.745
I blew it.

54:09.496 --> 54:12.165
She decided
we didn't ever need to talk again.

54:13.667 --> 54:16.669
Me, I became a cop.

54:16.837 --> 54:21.841
I'd been a rookie about two weeks
when we got the call.

54:22.009 --> 54:27.221
Highway patrol,
they saw a car on the side of the road.

54:29.433 --> 54:31.768
They called it in, we responded.

54:31.936 --> 54:33.770
It was a couple.

54:33.938 --> 54:36.940
The guy's body was in the woods
20 yards from the car.

54:37.107 --> 54:39.484
My partner found him.

54:39.652 --> 54:41.527
I found the girl.

54:42.363 --> 54:44.364
I found her in the car.

54:45.658 --> 54:46.741
And on the road.

54:48.077 --> 54:49.869
And in the woods.

54:50.454 --> 54:52.956
Your high school sweetheart
went on with her life.

54:53.832 --> 54:57.877
Mine got hacked up
by a nutcase with an ax.

55:00.130 --> 55:02.507
But that's not the fun part.

55:03.592 --> 55:05.635
The fun part's what happened next.

55:06.971 --> 55:08.805
What happened next?

55:08.973 --> 55:10.223
Guess.

55:10.391 --> 55:12.225
- The police found him?
- Close.

55:13.227 --> 55:15.019
I found him.

55:16.480 --> 55:19.816
It wasn't what you'd call
your routine police work either.

55:20.609 --> 55:23.653
- What would you call it?
- Revenge.

55:24.363 --> 55:27.615
See, I tracked him
during my off-hours.

55:28.200 --> 55:29.242
By yourself?

55:29.410 --> 55:31.369
Oh, no, no, no.

55:32.329 --> 55:34.747
I took my 12-gauge with me.

55:35.207 --> 55:37.542
I tracked him and I found him.

55:38.419 --> 55:40.545
And when I found him...

55:40.713 --> 55:44.132
...I leveled off that shotgun
right at his chest.

55:44.967 --> 55:46.592
Spanky, guess what happened next.

55:47.761 --> 55:49.804
Should you be telling me this?

55:50.264 --> 55:52.015
Close.

55:52.182 --> 55:53.850
I pulled the trigger.

55:55.227 --> 55:57.687
That's all real exciting
and everything...

55:57.855 --> 55:59.981
...but listen, I've got a mid-term...

56:00.149 --> 56:03.109
I wrapped his body in a plastic bag.

56:03.277 --> 56:05.236
I buried him in a vacant lot.

56:06.572 --> 56:09.699
The lot right behind
your girlfriend's sorority.

56:09.867 --> 56:11.743
Of course,
it isn't a vacant lot anymore.

56:13.662 --> 56:17.665
Now the housemother's cottage
is sitting right on top of it.

56:20.002 --> 56:23.629
Look, detective,
I don't mean to be rude or anything...

56:23.797 --> 56:28.259
...but other than just kind of wanting
to confess to a murder...

56:28.427 --> 56:30.094
...is there a point to this story?

56:30.763 --> 56:37.143
Spanky, that's exactly
what I'm trying to figure out.

56:40.189 --> 56:44.817
The old man left that home,
never to return again.

56:44.985 --> 56:48.237
As long as they can think,
we'll have our problems.

56:48.405 --> 56:50.531
But those whom we're using
cannot think.

56:50.699 --> 56:55.870
They are the dead, brought to a
simulated life by our electro-guns.

56:56.038 --> 56:57.914
You know, it's an interesting thing...

56:58.082 --> 57:00.750
...when you consider,
the Earth people who can think...

57:00.918 --> 57:03.377
...are so frightened
by those who cannot.

57:06.465 --> 57:09.842
Well, our ship should be regenerated.
We better get started.

58:07.234 --> 58:08.943
Thrill me.

58:26.253 --> 58:27.545
Cameron to Dispatch.

58:27.713 --> 58:29.714
Where the hell are my backups?

58:31.842 --> 58:33.467
What the...?

58:37.681 --> 58:39.557
Never mind.

58:55.073 --> 58:57.491
Check the neighborhood. Go ahead.

59:03.999 --> 59:07.501
She had a dog, but it took off
the second we kicked the door in.

59:12.132 --> 59:14.550
If we used a different stretcher
for every piece...

59:14.718 --> 59:16.844
...we'd be here all night.

59:27.147 --> 59:28.522
Forget it. Give it up.

59:28.690 --> 59:30.816
I don't see anything.

59:32.027 --> 59:33.319
A bit more.

59:33.487 --> 59:36.530
We checked the garage, checked
next door, checked that whole side.

59:36.698 --> 59:37.740
- And?
- Nothing.

59:37.908 --> 59:38.950
Check somewhere else.

59:39.117 --> 59:41.077
Don't come back
until you find something.

59:48.418 --> 59:50.169
You're right, this is stupid.

59:50.337 --> 59:51.712
Go.

59:55.008 --> 59:57.635
I said go, not stop.

01:00:05.852 --> 01:00:07.937
- Still nothing, sir.
- Wonderful.

01:00:08.105 --> 01:00:09.981
Wallace and Teague
are in the patrol car.

01:00:10.148 --> 01:00:11.983
Dante and DePalma
are on the other side.

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:13.567
- Reach for Hoffman.
- Detective.

01:00:13.735 --> 01:00:14.819
I thought we were...

01:00:14.987 --> 01:00:16.946
We've sighted suspect
and we're in pursuit.

01:00:17.114 --> 01:00:19.573
Request immediate backup.
Repeat, we have the sucker.

01:00:19.741 --> 01:00:22.493
We got him. We got him.

01:00:23.203 --> 01:00:26.580
Get the 12-gauge out of my car,
now.

01:00:51.231 --> 01:00:53.441
Freeze.

01:01:03.869 --> 01:01:05.786
I already killed you.

01:01:05.954 --> 01:01:08.372
You son of a bitch,
I already killed you.

01:02:01.843 --> 01:02:05.137
- What's going on?
- Oh, Paul, have you seen J.C.?

01:02:05.305 --> 01:02:06.889
He never came home last night.

01:02:07.057 --> 01:02:09.517
Last time I saw him,
you guys took off with that babe.

01:02:09.684 --> 01:02:12.978
Hey, Chris, what's the tux for, huh?

01:03:54.372 --> 01:03:56.081
Chris.

01:03:58.084 --> 01:04:00.586
There's one inside me.

01:04:01.963 --> 01:04:04.298
It got in through my mouth.

01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:07.843
I can feel it.

01:04:09.304 --> 01:04:11.639
It's in my brain.

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:20.231
I don't have a pulse or a heartbeat.

01:04:21.066 --> 01:04:23.067
I think I'm dead.

01:04:25.946 --> 01:04:27.905
I killed one.

01:04:28.073 --> 01:04:30.449
I lit a match to it.

01:04:30.617 --> 01:04:33.619
I think fire will kill them.

01:04:35.247 --> 01:04:39.917
I've gone to the furnace room,
the basement.

01:04:41.586 --> 01:04:43.796
If I don't come back...

01:04:45.924 --> 01:04:48.384
...heat will kill them.

01:04:52.597 --> 01:04:54.265
I walked, Chris.

01:04:54.432 --> 01:04:57.101
All by myself, I walked.

01:05:02.649 --> 01:05:04.692
I love you.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.738
Good luck with Cynthia.

01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:42.915
Let's go, bros.

01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:47.586
Hey, Cunningham,
where's Brad, man?

01:06:47.754 --> 01:06:50.172
I think he's bagging
the formal action.

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:51.590
I think Cindy blew him off.

01:06:51.758 --> 01:06:54.426
Oh, bogus, man.
He must be bummed.

01:06:54.594 --> 01:06:55.844
Really.

01:07:06.523 --> 01:07:08.190
Bitch.

01:07:14.114 --> 01:07:16.156
What the fuck?

01:07:21.955 --> 01:07:26.291
Hey, dog, did you see that thing?

01:07:30.714 --> 01:07:32.464
Let's go, come on.

01:07:32.632 --> 01:07:34.383
Let's go.

01:07:35.593 --> 01:07:37.636
We're out of here.

01:07:37.804 --> 01:07:39.638
Let's blow this pop stand.

01:07:39.806 --> 01:07:42.599
We're going to get done, dudes.

01:08:34.694 --> 01:08:36.862
What?

01:08:37.322 --> 01:08:38.863
They got Alfalfa.

01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:42.868
They get in through your mouth...

01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:47.080
...and then they lay eggs
in your brain...

01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:52.461
...and you walk around
while they incubate.

01:08:54.339 --> 01:08:57.466
And you walk around
even if you're dead.

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:25.868
Wonderful.

01:09:46.890 --> 01:09:48.100
Come on, you guys.

01:09:48.268 --> 01:09:50.727
Settle down or I'll stop the bus.

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:08.120
Hi, Walt.

01:10:08.288 --> 01:10:10.122
Well, well, well,
Detective Ray Cameron.

01:10:10.290 --> 01:10:13.625
- Son of a gun, is that really you?
- It's me, all right. How's by you?

01:10:13.793 --> 01:10:17.462
Hey, can't complain.
Cannot complain, Raymond.

01:10:18.464 --> 01:10:20.382
Hi, sport.

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:22.676
Pretty fancy set of duds
you got on there.

01:10:22.844 --> 01:10:26.305
What is it, Halloween or something,
Ray? Hey, kid, I'm only kidding.

01:10:27.724 --> 01:10:30.100
So, what can I do you for?

01:10:30.685 --> 01:10:35.022
Well, the thing is, Walter,
what I need is...

01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:36.982
...I need your basic flamethrower.

01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:39.568
Flamethrower? Flamethrower?

01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:41.069
Yeah.

01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:43.447
Flamethrower? Jesus.

01:10:43.615 --> 01:10:46.867
What's the matter? The old snub-nose
ain't good enough for you anymore?

01:10:47.035 --> 01:10:50.662
Yeah, I know. Just bring out
the old heavy artillery, will you, Walt?

01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:55.834
We got one slingshot and one BB gun
and one flamethrower.

01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:58.503
There you go.

01:10:59.422 --> 01:11:00.839
Gotta watch out for this baby.

01:11:01.007 --> 01:11:02.466
Light the pilot, it goes out...

01:11:02.634 --> 01:11:04.885
...and it plays hard to get
like a son of a bitch.

01:11:05.053 --> 01:11:08.263
- Thanks.
- So if you let me have the requisition.

01:11:08.431 --> 01:11:12.225
Oh, well, the thing is...

01:11:12.393 --> 01:11:14.645
Oh, the thing is, Walter, I...

01:11:16.022 --> 01:11:19.358
I don't have a requisition form
is the thing.

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:23.695
You don't? Well, jeez.

01:11:23.863 --> 01:11:26.698
To tell you the truth, Ray,
there could be a little problem.

01:11:26.866 --> 01:11:28.450
Yeah.

01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:33.705
There could be a little problem.

01:12:12.912 --> 01:12:13.954
Well, I'm so sure.

01:12:14.122 --> 01:12:17.749
Don't everybody run to answer
the door at once.

01:12:17.917 --> 01:12:19.626
Guy.

01:12:25.466 --> 01:12:27.092
I'm so sure.

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:29.928
Very hilarious, Brad.

01:12:30.763 --> 01:12:33.724
Cindy, Brad's here.

01:13:57.183 --> 01:13:59.851
I was gonna call you.

01:14:02.522 --> 01:14:07.651
Look,
I'm sorry things didn't work out.

01:14:08.361 --> 01:14:11.029
We're just two different people.

01:14:11.197 --> 01:14:14.783
That doesn't mean
that it's over forever.

01:14:14.951 --> 01:14:17.244
We just need time to think.

01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:19.121
Cynthia, get away from it.

01:14:36.222 --> 01:14:39.391
Sorry, Brad. Don't take it personal.

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:45.897
Hey, who are you?

01:14:46.065 --> 01:14:47.357
I'm gonna call the police.

01:14:47.525 --> 01:14:50.402
You do that. Now.

01:14:51.195 --> 01:14:52.988
I'm sorry.

01:14:53.156 --> 01:14:54.948
I didn't know that it was...

01:14:55.116 --> 01:14:57.784
Here, hold this, you'll feel better.

01:15:11.174 --> 01:15:13.800
I've got good news
and bad news, girls.

01:15:13.968 --> 01:15:15.969
The good news is
your dates are here.

01:15:16.137 --> 01:15:17.387
What's the bad news?

01:15:18.055 --> 01:15:19.306
They're dead.

01:15:19.473 --> 01:15:20.932
Shit.

01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:22.225
Oh, shit.

01:15:22.393 --> 01:15:23.560
Cynthia, look.

01:15:23.728 --> 01:15:26.771
Look,
you squeeze this thing to fire, okay?

01:15:27.106 --> 01:15:30.692
Jesus, Cynthia. Try and fire it.

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:32.944
Do something, damn it!

01:15:35.448 --> 01:15:37.073
Well, don't go out there.

01:15:37.241 --> 01:15:40.118
So fire when I do, okay?

01:15:40.286 --> 01:15:42.287
Are you ready?

01:15:43.789 --> 01:15:45.373
Now!

01:15:49.837 --> 01:15:52.255
You. Lock those doors.

01:16:06.437 --> 01:16:07.687
Duck.

01:16:08.648 --> 01:16:09.731
It's Miller time.

01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:16.506
Don't these creeps
take no for an answer?

01:17:16.674 --> 01:17:17.924
How many of them are there?

01:17:18.092 --> 01:17:20.176
Come on, come on. Shoot him.

01:17:20.344 --> 01:17:22.387
It's jammed.

01:17:29.103 --> 01:17:31.563
Give me a fucking break.

01:17:38.696 --> 01:17:40.864
Here, come on.

01:17:59.342 --> 01:18:00.592
Real good plan.

01:18:13.564 --> 01:18:15.607
Oh, my God.

01:18:34.418 --> 01:18:36.294
Chris.

01:18:36.796 --> 01:18:39.631
Chris. Chris.

01:18:39.799 --> 01:18:41.883
Chris.

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:56.606
Get out of there.

01:18:57.274 --> 01:18:58.650
Go.

01:19:02.696 --> 01:19:04.364
Later, dude.

01:19:30.057 --> 01:19:31.599
Holy shit, the basement.

01:19:31.767 --> 01:19:32.892
What's in the basement?

01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:36.187
Storage, boxes.

01:19:38.357 --> 01:19:41.359
One of the girl's science projects.

01:19:44.655 --> 01:19:47.490
- Oh, my...
- Get out of the house.

01:19:51.704 --> 01:19:54.456
Get out of the house.

01:19:58.210 --> 01:20:00.837
Get out of the house now.

01:20:50.221 --> 01:20:51.763
No, no. Get out.

01:20:51.931 --> 01:20:55.183
Get out, get out of here.
Take her and get out.

01:20:55.351 --> 01:20:57.268
Get the hell out of here.

01:21:09.657 --> 01:21:11.616
Wonderful.

01:21:18.666 --> 01:21:21.125
Don't even think about it,
you little son of a bitch.

01:21:24.088 --> 01:21:26.339
Twenty.

01:21:36.809 --> 01:21:38.643
Nineteen.

01:21:47.987 --> 01:21:49.988
Eighteen.

01:21:56.203 --> 01:21:58.580
Seventeen.

01:22:01.166 --> 01:22:03.001
Sixteen.

01:22:06.463 --> 01:22:09.966
Thirteen, 12, 11.

01:22:12.052 --> 01:22:16.222
Ten, nine...

01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:20.143
...eight, seven...

01:22:20.644 --> 01:22:21.728
...six...

01:22:22.354 --> 01:22:28.860
Five, four, three...

01:22:32.197 --> 01:22:33.948
One.

01:22:35.618 --> 01:22:38.578
Detective, thrill me.

01:23:27.002 --> 01:23:28.753
Nice tux.
