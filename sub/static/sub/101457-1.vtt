00:24.595 --> 00:26.530
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

00:26.563 --> 00:29.433
Dungeon boy fuckin'
bitch faggot.

00:29.466 --> 00:30.367
Fag.

00:31.368 --> 00:32.904
We call you
the fucking locker room

00:32.937 --> 00:34.204
dungeon boy bitch.

00:34.238 --> 00:35.774
Look at this fuckin' guy.

00:35.807 --> 00:37.709
Can we get this
stuttering dungeon boy faggot

00:37.742 --> 00:39.678
over the toilet where he
belongs.

00:39.711 --> 00:41.545
- Oh, yeah!
- What'd you say?

00:44.716 --> 00:47.217
Take a drink.

00:47.251 --> 00:48.653
Go ahead there, Dungeon
Boy.

00:48.687 --> 00:50.755
Come on you fucked up
little fag.

01:53.785 --> 01:56.721
Who would've
thought four students

01:56.755 --> 01:59.657
could entirely destroy
the halls of Arcadia.

02:00.959 --> 02:03.828
The mess you've made is
nothing short of amazing.

02:05.997 --> 02:09.433
Now, whatever plans you've
had for the last week

02:09.466 --> 02:12.737
of summer break, consider those
replaced.

02:12.771 --> 02:15.405
You're here to stay as
punishment,

02:15.439 --> 02:16.975
repairing the damage you've
done.

02:20.477 --> 02:22.046
You'll find everything you
need to make this right

02:22.080 --> 02:23.280
in the boiler room.

02:24.348 --> 02:26.918
I'll be in my office,
waiting for it to be over.

02:28.987 --> 02:30.855
I'd appreciate it if you
didn't cause any more trouble

02:30.889 --> 02:32.857
than you already have.

02:32.891 --> 02:35.392
Now get to work, because
none of us are leaving

02:35.425 --> 02:36.995
until it's all finished.

02:37.028 --> 02:38.630
No.

02:38.663 --> 02:39.530
No?

02:40.899 --> 02:41.833
No.

02:41.866 --> 02:42.834
Where's Gus?

02:42.867 --> 02:44.535
Gus was murdered.

02:44.568 --> 02:46.570
Someone snuck into his house,

02:46.603 --> 02:48.106
tied him to a chair in his
basement

02:48.139 --> 02:50.675
and stabbed him four times
with a kitchen knife.

02:50.708 --> 02:51.608
In the belly.

02:52.644 --> 02:54.545
That's messed up and
everything but so what?

02:54.578 --> 02:56.513
Get a new janitor.

02:56.547 --> 02:58.448
Don't act like you don't know

02:58.482 --> 03:01.418
what I'm talking about, Louis,
it won't get you out of this.

03:06.390 --> 03:07.992
Well how long is this gonna
take?

03:08.026 --> 03:11.763
Stop asking questions and
start fixing this, Mouse,

03:11.796 --> 03:14.833
unless you want Ammit to eat
your rotten little heart.

03:16.734 --> 03:21.739
Get going, all of you.

03:29.948 --> 03:31.515
What a freak.

03:31.548 --> 03:33.051
Yeah, what was
that she said about Gus?

03:33.084 --> 03:35.586
Didn't you hear, he
got stabbed in the belly.

03:35.619 --> 03:36.855
Belly.

03:36.888 --> 03:39.023
That can't be true though, can
it?

03:39.057 --> 03:41.092
Of course not, she's fuckin'
with us.

03:41.125 --> 03:43.161
Yeah, and what was
that shit about Ammit,

03:43.194 --> 03:44.829
why does he wanna eat my heart?

03:46.563 --> 03:49.934
Ammit's an Egyptian
monster, and she's a girl.

03:51.002 --> 03:54.005
You know, in ancient Egypt when
you died

03:54.038 --> 03:56.074
they would weigh your heart
to see how heavy it was

03:56.107 --> 03:59.177
with wrongdoing, and then
you know, if it was too heavy

03:59.210 --> 04:01.411
they would feed it to Ammit.

04:01.445 --> 04:03.547
Okay, all right, I call
bullshit.

04:03.580 --> 04:05.016
It's not a real thing, idiot.

04:06.184 --> 04:08.086
And then they would feed you
to her.

04:11.856 --> 04:12.724
Dude.

04:13.925 --> 04:14.792
Really?

04:15.727 --> 04:16.593
Really.

04:17.594 --> 04:20.765
The sooner we get done,
the sooner we get done.

04:20.798 --> 04:22.100
And I don't know about you,

04:22.132 --> 04:23.868
but I don't wanna be stuck here
forever.

05:21.626 --> 05:24.228
You're not doing this, are
you?

05:25.562 --> 05:26.731
- Emily.
- What?

05:26.764 --> 05:28.800
Are you gonna clean this?

05:31.903 --> 05:32.770
No.

05:33.638 --> 05:36.007
Well, I was gonna go class by
class

05:36.040 --> 05:37.607
and I was thinking if you went
with me

05:37.642 --> 05:39.509
we could get the same amount
done

05:39.543 --> 05:41.245
because we'd be going twice as
fast.

05:46.851 --> 05:47.685
Emily.

05:47.719 --> 05:49.120
What?

05:49.153 --> 05:51.555
Is there something wrong?

05:53.124 --> 05:54.624
Everything's fine.

05:54.659 --> 05:55.525
Okay.

06:23.654 --> 06:25.857
God, please stop.

06:26.991 --> 06:27.859
Louis?

06:30.995 --> 06:31.863
Louis?

06:33.831 --> 06:34.699
Louis!

06:35.900 --> 06:36.768
Louis!

07:26.384 --> 07:28.086
Boo!

07:29.087 --> 07:30.788
Bet she locked it.

07:30.822 --> 07:32.757
That bitch probably thinks
we'll steal something.

07:34.725 --> 07:35.592
Check it.

07:39.097 --> 07:41.833
Scottie French don't get
on his knees for nobody.

07:50.041 --> 07:52.343
So I think Emily's off her
meds.

07:52.376 --> 07:53.244
Ya think?

07:54.745 --> 07:56.714
Louis would know for sure,
right?

07:56.747 --> 07:57.415
Told her she should.

07:57.448 --> 07:59.050
Scottie.

07:59.083 --> 08:00.284
Mouse, she's miserable on
those things.

08:00.318 --> 08:02.253
She gets fat, face goes all
weird.

08:04.856 --> 08:06.057
M-m-mouse!

08:07.158 --> 08:08.860
She drools.

08:08.893 --> 08:11.062
Yeah, I guess she's kind of
a disaster when she's on them.

08:11.095 --> 08:13.865
Yeah, because they kind
of turn her into a retard.

08:13.898 --> 08:15.166
She can't even do her art
projects.

08:15.199 --> 08:16.200
Yeah, that's true.

08:16.234 --> 08:18.269
Yo, did you call me?

08:22.740 --> 08:24.976
Oh look, it fell.

08:25.810 --> 08:27.111
We were
just talkin' about Emily

08:27.145 --> 08:28.746
goin' off her Haldol.

08:28.779 --> 08:31.115
Awesome, right, she's no
fun when she's on that shit.

08:31.149 --> 08:33.116
I don't know, she's staring at
something

08:33.150 --> 08:34.118
outside the window.

08:34.152 --> 08:35.385
Oh yeah?

08:36.287 --> 08:37.788
What?

08:37.822 --> 08:39.090
I have no idea, could be
anything.

08:39.123 --> 08:41.025
She's acting really, ya know.

08:42.727 --> 08:45.196
Well I hope one of you guys
brought bandages or something.

08:45.229 --> 08:46.831
She doesn't need any,

08:46.864 --> 08:48.299
she brought all those
rags from the basement.

08:48.332 --> 08:49.367
Jesus, Louis.

08:49.400 --> 08:51.202
Go see to your girl, man.

08:51.235 --> 08:54.372
Yeah, well, hey,

08:57.041 --> 08:58.042
I got this.

09:00.411 --> 09:02.847
That's
unbelievable.

09:18.796 --> 09:19.931
Yo.

09:19.964 --> 09:21.098
Think there's someone
outside.

09:21.132 --> 09:22.099
Oh yeah.

09:22.133 --> 09:23.000
Yeah.

09:24.835 --> 09:27.004
I've never been in the
girls bathroom before.

09:27.038 --> 09:29.273
You guys are pigs.

09:29.307 --> 09:32.076
I keep seeing someone
outside sneaking around.

09:33.844 --> 09:35.046
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

09:51.562 --> 09:55.466
Come on.

09:55.499 --> 09:56.367
Stop it.

09:58.336 --> 09:59.971
Get off of me!

10:16.854 --> 10:17.855
Don't.

12:54.478 --> 12:56.147
Scottie?

13:05.523 --> 13:07.024
Was I right about it being
locked?

13:07.057 --> 13:10.094
Oh, oh, you're like a ghost.

13:10.127 --> 13:11.195
I got ninja skills.

13:15.199 --> 13:16.534
Oh this school's noisy.

13:17.669 --> 13:19.503
What do you mean?

13:19.537 --> 13:23.307
So I was cleaning, I heard
this clicking and this banging,

13:23.340 --> 13:24.208
and then just now...

13:24.241 --> 13:26.343
Banging, really?

13:26.377 --> 13:30.414
Yeah, but it was like
someone outside, like a thunk.

13:31.582 --> 13:33.517
Yeah, I heard it too.

13:38.222 --> 13:39.323
Show me.

13:39.356 --> 13:41.325
♪ I love to go to school ♪

13:41.358 --> 13:44.161
♪ I love to go to school ♪

13:44.195 --> 13:49.200

13:52.704 --> 13:54.972
♪ I love ♪

14:35.079 --> 14:37.381
I think it'd be cool one
time if you let me cut you.

14:37.414 --> 14:38.315
Ha!

14:38.349 --> 14:39.751
I could do your back.

14:39.784 --> 14:42.086
I can do my back on my
own, all I need's a mirror.

14:42.119 --> 14:43.153
You could show me where.

14:43.187 --> 14:43.688
Drop it.

14:45.589 --> 14:46.524
What's with you?

14:48.292 --> 14:50.294
You need to leave the
bathroom, Louie.

14:51.428 --> 14:54.431
What's wrong all the
sudden, what did I do?

15:01.238 --> 15:04.676
I don't know which is
worse, the boy I'm fucking

15:04.709 --> 15:08.813
asks me what's with me
when he knows I'm bonkers,

15:08.847 --> 15:11.482
or that I continue to fuck him.

15:11.515 --> 15:14.618
You think it'd be cool
if I let you cut me,

15:14.653 --> 15:15.720
are you kidding?

15:17.187 --> 15:19.390
I'm the only one that
can see the patterns.

15:22.827 --> 15:23.795
Fucking idiot!

15:26.831 --> 15:28.633
I'm gonna leave you
alone for a little bit.

15:28.667 --> 15:30.434
Yeah, you are.

15:31.502 --> 15:33.137
Open or closed?

15:33.170 --> 15:33.872
Closed.

15:39.911 --> 15:41.345
Fuckin' crazy bitch.

16:48.813 --> 16:52.216
At first I thought
it was to keep the vandals out.

16:52.249 --> 16:54.719
No, Arcadia would've
gotten the same size locks

16:54.753 --> 16:57.254
on every window, but
each one is different.

16:58.690 --> 17:01.191
Yeah, maybe they were
just trying to save money.

17:01.225 --> 17:02.894
Because they didn't
have any money left over

17:02.927 --> 17:06.262
after the new central air
system and the TV studio?

17:06.296 --> 17:07.164
Yeah, no.

18:36.688 --> 18:37.689
What?

18:37.722 --> 18:38.757
Are you guys dressed?

18:38.790 --> 18:40.759
It's just me, go away.

18:41.793 --> 18:43.828
Okay, I'm gonna get
Persephone.

18:43.862 --> 18:46.330
Do you really want that
bitch up our ass all night?

18:46.363 --> 18:49.533
Emily's fine, she's a cutter,
this is what she does.

18:49.566 --> 18:51.468
When Persephone finds
her bleeding like that,

18:51.502 --> 18:52.904
we're all comin' back tomorrow.

18:52.937 --> 18:54.706
I don't care about tomorrow.

18:54.739 --> 18:57.574
We're stuck here tonight
if we can't find a way out.

19:51.830 --> 19:53.097
Miss Persephone?

19:57.101 --> 19:58.970
What is going on here?

20:00.071 --> 20:04.909
Hey, Miss Persephone, do you
know if all the first floor

20:04.943 --> 20:07.312
classroom windows are
suppose to be locked?

20:15.987 --> 20:19.356
Miss Persephone, I think we're
locked in.

20:20.859 --> 20:24.028
Miss Persephone, do you know
if we can turn down the heat?

20:28.766 --> 20:29.901
Are you okay?

20:31.703 --> 20:32.971
Miss Persephone?

20:45.149 --> 20:46.017
Oh shit.

20:47.752 --> 20:49.087
Hey, hey fuckers!

20:54.125 --> 20:57.128
Miss Persephone, do
you think it would be possible

20:57.161 --> 20:58.495
to turn down the heat?

20:59.197 --> 21:01.398
But it's already
so cold.

21:48.279 --> 21:49.814
Scottie, Louis!

21:50.882 --> 21:52.116
Oh, no.

21:52.150 --> 21:53.685
Oh, no!

21:53.718 --> 21:54.953
What the hell?

21:56.921 --> 22:01.259
Miss Persephone.

22:01.292 --> 22:02.961
- Did they hurt you?
- Miss Persephone.

22:02.994 --> 22:03.928
They?

22:03.962 --> 22:05.063
In her office, she...

22:05.096 --> 22:06.664
Breathe.

22:06.698 --> 22:09.067
Half of her face is gone

22:09.100 --> 22:10.935
and she's just sitting there,

22:10.969 --> 22:13.271
she's just rocking back and
forth.

22:13.304 --> 22:16.140
And I don't get why it's
so fucking hot in here.

22:16.174 --> 22:17.108
Who's they?

22:17.141 --> 22:19.010
Wait, what happened?

22:19.043 --> 22:22.612
I don't know, I don't know,
but Miss Persephone is hurt.

22:22.647 --> 22:24.148
She's really fucked up

22:24.182 --> 22:26.851
and we're fucking locked in here
with her.

22:26.884 --> 22:28.019
Locked in?

22:28.052 --> 22:28.953
Yes.

22:28.987 --> 22:30.587
Bullshit.

22:34.292 --> 22:36.627
Somebody broke the
fuckin' key off in here.

22:43.234 --> 22:44.235
I'll go get Emily.

22:44.268 --> 22:45.770
Meet us by the offices.

22:45.803 --> 22:46.871
Okay.

23:11.029 --> 23:13.664
In a couple
of hours, we go hot.

23:13.698 --> 23:15.233
When that smoke bomb blows
you're gonna be happy

23:15.266 --> 23:16.901
we ran our drill like this,

23:16.934 --> 23:19.170
'cause shit's gonna get real
hectic.

23:23.808 --> 23:24.675
Emily.

23:38.156 --> 23:39.857
Well I wasn't being serious.

23:44.796 --> 23:46.064
Goddammit, Emily.

23:48.833 --> 23:50.134
Goddammit, what?

23:53.004 --> 23:54.906
Well did you cut the right
pattern?

23:57.875 --> 23:59.343
Look, don't laugh at me okay,

23:59.377 --> 24:01.679
- I came back here for you.
- I didn't cut anything.

24:01.712 --> 24:03.314
Well then your cleaning
rags are bleeding.

24:03.347 --> 24:06.751
Your clothes are bleeding,
whatever, we need to go.

24:24.001 --> 24:25.303
Somebody's pushing
us.

24:25.336 --> 24:26.737
I was chasing four dudes

24:26.771 --> 24:28.005
- down the hall...
- They're wearing gas masks,

24:28.039 --> 24:28.873
I saw them outside.

24:28.906 --> 24:30.741
Of course all the doors in the
hallway,

24:30.775 --> 24:32.410
even Persephone's, are locked.

24:32.443 --> 24:35.813
Scottie doesn't even
think she's hurt, but I saw.

24:36.714 --> 24:39.217
Stop fucking doing
that.

24:39.250 --> 24:40.885
Funny, she thought
that I was seeing things.

24:40.918 --> 24:42.353
Mouse doesn't see things.

24:43.354 --> 24:46.357
In juvenile hall, they used
to play head games like this,

24:46.390 --> 24:51.062
all the time, called it
experimental rehabilitation therapy.

24:51.095 --> 24:52.697
But all it did was break you
down

24:52.730 --> 24:54.432
so they could identify your
weaknesses.

24:54.465 --> 24:56.167
Why do you think they're
blasting the heat?

24:56.200 --> 24:57.668
We're locked in.

24:57.702 --> 24:59.137
The guys in the gas masks ran
from me

24:59.170 --> 25:01.339
when it would've been four
against one.

25:01.372 --> 25:04.175
And now this, they're stress
testing us.

25:08.980 --> 25:09.947
Oh my gosh!

25:11.382 --> 25:13.251
Emily, you said you didn't cut
yourself.

25:13.284 --> 25:15.720
There's a difference between
cutting and bleeding, Louie.

25:15.753 --> 25:17.255
I'm taking her
to the nurse's office.

25:28.099 --> 25:29.333
Find something to sanitize it
with.

25:29.367 --> 25:30.234
Louis!

25:30.268 --> 25:32.136
Oh, oh, oh, Louis.

25:32.170 --> 25:33.137
It's gonna burn.

25:33.171 --> 25:34.705
You're okay
with that, right Emily?

25:34.739 --> 25:35.473
I hope so.

25:36.307 --> 25:37.241
Hold her!

25:37.275 --> 25:41.112
Ow, please!

25:41.145 --> 25:44.749
Ow!

25:44.782 --> 25:46.050
It's gonna...

25:46.083 --> 25:47.051
It's all right, it's
okay.

25:47.084 --> 25:48.786
- It's okay, it's okay.
- You're gonna be fine.

25:50.788 --> 25:54.859
Emily, I'm here, I'm
here too.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.869
You're lucky you didn't
have time to get to your back

26:04.902 --> 26:06.337
or you'd be wrapped up like a
mummy

26:06.370 --> 26:07.872
and the ass hat'll come after
you.

26:07.905 --> 26:09.874
It's Ammit, and she didn't eat
blood,

26:09.907 --> 26:11.976
Rakshasa eat blood.

26:12.009 --> 26:13.010
What happened?

26:15.379 --> 26:18.349
I told Louis, I didn't cut
anything.

26:18.382 --> 26:23.087
I wanted to but, there just
weren't any transmissions.

26:23.120 --> 26:24.155
Did someone else cut you?

26:24.188 --> 26:25.122
I made the cuts.

26:25.156 --> 26:26.424
But you just said...

26:26.457 --> 26:28.226
I made the cuts a long time
ago.

26:28.259 --> 26:29.860
They just started bleeding,
and now they won't stop.

26:29.894 --> 26:32.396
What the fuck is so hard
for you to understand?

26:32.430 --> 26:33.931
Okay.

26:33.965 --> 26:35.333
Louis and I are gonna do some
recon.

26:35.366 --> 26:36.434
Find us a way out of here,

26:36.467 --> 26:37.535
or someone who'll show us one.

26:37.568 --> 26:39.403
It's about to get fucked up!

26:39.437 --> 26:41.839
What happened to all this
just being about head games?

26:41.872 --> 26:43.174
Probably true.

26:43.207 --> 26:44.208
But if someone gets...

26:44.242 --> 26:46.043
Hurt?

26:46.077 --> 26:47.979
Accidentally, because they
pushed one of us too far,

26:49.480 --> 26:51.249
whose fault is that?

26:58.823 --> 27:02.793
Find who's doing this, I'm
going to fuckin' kill them.

27:05.263 --> 27:07.331
I don't care who they are.

27:07.365 --> 27:08.232
I hear ya.

27:09.166 --> 27:10.935
Do you?

27:10.968 --> 27:14.805
Dude, you went to juvie
for puttin' Bart Montandon

27:14.839 --> 27:19.844
in the hospital, that means
you can do anything.

27:20.211 --> 27:21.545
You're a fucking god, man.

27:26.183 --> 27:28.219
You know why I took
that ax handle to his face?

27:28.252 --> 27:30.454
Uh, because
he's an asshole zombie

27:30.488 --> 27:32.423
like everyone else in this
fucking school.

27:32.456 --> 27:34.492
Him and Chad Pollard,
some of those guys,

27:34.525 --> 27:37.528
did something to me after
gym class, freshman year.

27:37.561 --> 27:39.063
You probably saw it online.

27:39.096 --> 27:41.499
What, like the locker room
dungeon,

27:41.532 --> 27:42.867
hold ah, hold up.

27:44.001 --> 27:47.371
Are you saying you were the
locker room dungeon boy?

27:47.405 --> 27:49.173
But they said that that was a
hoax and

27:49.206 --> 27:51.042
- you didn't even really do...
- that's what they said.

27:51.075 --> 27:54.812
And because they covered my
face, I couldn't prove anything.

27:55.613 --> 27:58.049
My word against the football
team's.

27:59.050 --> 28:01.118
Now who do you think the
maggots running the school

28:01.152 --> 28:03.254
are going to believe?

28:03.287 --> 28:06.557
I get an opening, I'm going
to cross the line tonight.

28:06.590 --> 28:09.327
God, I wish there were
some vipers around right now,

28:09.360 --> 28:11.962
we would take care of 'em
for sure, right Scottie?

28:13.130 --> 28:16.067
Check it out man,
somebody's listening to you.

28:46.263 --> 28:47.531
Mouse cleaned this
one.

28:47.565 --> 28:49.166
That means they're still at
it.

28:49.200 --> 28:51.335
Let's go to the kitchen
for a weapons upgrade.

28:51.369 --> 28:55.005
Five, four, three,
two.

29:00.211 --> 29:01.545
Turner, I
don't have a stapler,

29:01.579 --> 29:02.647
I can't do that right now.

29:03.614 --> 29:04.482
Hey!

29:06.951 --> 29:07.952
Get away!

29:07.985 --> 29:09.688
What the fuck?

29:14.693 --> 29:16.327
Hey.

29:19.530 --> 29:21.599
Wait a minute!

29:30.007 --> 29:32.209
Pay attention, you
fuckers.

29:32.243 --> 29:34.111
You wanna see what happens next?

29:34.145 --> 29:35.012
Watch the wave.

29:49.093 --> 29:52.363
What's it like, having
hallucinations?

29:55.032 --> 29:56.333
How do you know what's real?

30:03.207 --> 30:05.376
What's it like not
having hallucinations?

30:08.546 --> 30:10.014
If I see it, it's real.

30:20.725 --> 30:24.595
Um, so I had a mouse one time.

30:25.529 --> 30:27.364
It was like a little white one.

30:27.398 --> 30:30.134
And I found her in my basement
when she was just a baby.

30:31.502 --> 30:33.103
I named her Mouse.

30:35.740 --> 30:38.175
I used to hide her in my
backpack,

30:38.209 --> 30:39.778
and then I would take her
with me to junior high,

30:39.811 --> 30:41.780
just 'cause I was afraid
of what my dad would do

30:41.813 --> 30:43.047
if he found her.

30:43.080 --> 30:44.548
What, do to the mouse?

30:44.582 --> 30:45.650
Uh, to me.

30:47.218 --> 30:49.019
But I was being selfish, you
know,

30:49.053 --> 30:51.355
'cause I should've been worrying
about Vanessa Kebnickies.

30:51.388 --> 30:55.359
God, that bitch, she deserves
to die.

30:55.392 --> 30:57.127
Yeah, right, why,

30:58.630 --> 31:01.766
so yeah, so I guess she
found out about the mouse

31:01.800 --> 31:06.671
and I saw her at lunch one
day and she was whispering

31:06.705 --> 31:09.708
to Sam Tisdale, and
then next thing I know,

31:09.741 --> 31:13.444
Sam and Bobby and all those
guys, they take my backpack

31:13.477 --> 31:16.113
and they start playing keep away
with it.

31:16.146 --> 31:18.048
They knew Mouse was inside the
bag,

31:18.082 --> 31:19.583
but one of them dropped it.

31:19.617 --> 31:23.153
So they just started
kicking it back and forth.

31:23.187 --> 31:25.623
And you know, like the harder
I screamed at them to stop,

31:25.657 --> 31:27.224
the harder they kicked.

31:27.258 --> 31:30.027
And then they just kinda
started stomping on it.

31:32.563 --> 31:35.700
Yeah so, they're done, and
I couldn't open the bag,

31:35.734 --> 31:38.102
so I just buried it in my
back yard.

31:39.804 --> 31:41.740
But I knew my dad would
beat the shit out of me

31:41.773 --> 31:44.141
when I told him I lost the
backpack,

31:44.174 --> 31:45.543
but I didn't care you know,

31:45.576 --> 31:48.112
'cause I kinda thought I
deserved it.

31:48.145 --> 31:49.848
Because like, I let something

31:49.881 --> 31:52.316
that never did anything
to anyone get hurt,

31:52.349 --> 31:54.618
'cause I was afraid of
what might happen to me.

31:56.520 --> 31:58.857
So that night, when I first saw
her,

31:58.890 --> 32:00.725
I was horrified you know,
'cause,

32:02.526 --> 32:07.498
like, her skull was crushed
and her spine was broken

32:07.799 --> 32:09.634
and she had like blood in her
ears.

32:11.435 --> 32:15.205
And I kept thinking about her
chewing through the backpack,

32:15.239 --> 32:17.842
and then, you know, like
digging through the dirt,

32:19.376 --> 32:23.213
and somehow finding her way
to my house and up the stairs,

32:23.247 --> 32:25.482
and to my room, 'cause I mean,

32:25.516 --> 32:28.118
she was on the pillow right next
to me.

32:30.387 --> 32:32.724
And so, you know, I reached out
my hand

32:32.757 --> 32:35.627
'cause I wanna hold her,
and I want to tell her

32:35.660 --> 32:38.295
that nothing like this'll
ever happen again and,

32:39.330 --> 32:40.497
and I can't.

32:41.700 --> 32:44.335
You know, my fingers just
kinda slip right through her.

32:51.241 --> 32:53.678
That's why I know a million
things about what people think

32:53.712 --> 32:55.714
happen to you after you die
because,

32:57.381 --> 33:00.451
if there's an afterlife,

33:00.484 --> 33:01.853
I know I saw her spirit.

33:01.886 --> 33:03.454
Shit, if you'd told me that
earlier,

33:03.487 --> 33:05.356
I wouldn't have flushed my
Haldol.

33:10.795 --> 33:13.597
The first time I ever heard
anyone call you Mouse,

33:13.632 --> 33:15.767
it was uh, it was old Gus.

33:20.204 --> 33:22.373
You must be
crazy telling that story

33:22.406 --> 33:24.208
to the pervie janitor.

33:25.309 --> 33:30.314
Emily, Gus is my
father.

33:33.417 --> 33:34.618
You knew that.

33:59.778 --> 34:01.378
Yeah, come on, let's go!

34:01.412 --> 34:03.213
Bring it!

34:20.597 --> 34:22.599
Let's see you try to take this
from me, you motherfuckers.

34:51.730 --> 34:54.833
Come on, we're done here.

35:21.993 --> 35:24.996
Keep it movin'.

35:25.029 --> 35:27.331
Scores and birthdays, bud.

35:27.364 --> 35:28.700
Eat shit.

35:34.773 --> 35:36.373
Yes, this is what you need,
right thing.

35:36.406 --> 35:37.909
Great.

35:37.942 --> 35:39.576
All right sweetie, sweetie,
I already gave you these...

35:39.610 --> 35:41.512
- They dropped on the floor.
- Now hold on to those,

35:41.545 --> 35:43.014
and just color so mommy can get
work done.

35:43.047 --> 35:45.516
I can't see through the booth
with this ladder in the way.

35:45.549 --> 35:46.383
Can I move it?

35:48.552 --> 35:51.355
Oh, what're you doing, you
silly goose?

35:51.388 --> 35:53.024
Come on, keep it
moving.

35:55.627 --> 35:57.695
Vanessa, Vanessa, Kapnicki.

35:57.729 --> 35:58.830
Like your photo.

35:58.863 --> 35:59.731
Take another shot!

36:01.532 --> 36:03.333
Vanessa!

36:04.869 --> 36:06.403
Be cool.

36:07.538 --> 36:09.741
Being cool, means being quiet.

36:15.146 --> 36:16.014
Oh that's awesome.

36:19.951 --> 36:21.820
Oh yeah, yes, you're hired,

36:21.853 --> 36:23.855
you're hired, come on.

36:23.888 --> 36:25.089
Get up!

36:25.123 --> 36:26.758
Come on,
you're the one, Vanessa.

36:26.958 --> 36:28.092
Come on, Vanessa.

36:28.126 --> 36:31.361
- Bring the bitch with us.
- Where are you taking her?

36:31.395 --> 36:32.596
Where are you taking her?

36:32.630 --> 36:33.298
Sammy Tisdale.

36:33.330 --> 36:34.732
Death has come this day for you,

36:34.766 --> 36:37.068
- Sammy Tisdale.
- Tisdale, Tisdale.

37:17.208 --> 37:18.877
All right, I guess
whatever Gus is doing...

37:18.910 --> 37:20.745
- is just gonna have to...
- Mom, can I have some juice?

37:20.778 --> 37:22.146
I'm hot.

37:22.180 --> 37:23.748
All right, let's see what I
packed you.

37:27.085 --> 37:28.953
Get in there,
get in the fuckin' room.

37:28.987 --> 37:30.487
Morning, students.

37:30.520 --> 37:32.156
Get 'em over there, corral 'em.

37:32.190 --> 37:33.191
Against the wall!

37:33.224 --> 37:33.992
Get over there

37:34.025 --> 37:34.893
you pansy ass.

37:34.926 --> 37:36.560
- Get over there!
- Against the wall!

37:36.593 --> 37:37.095
You too.

37:37.762 --> 37:39.496
Get behind the news desk.

37:39.529 --> 37:40.397
Get in here,
pussies!

37:40.430 --> 37:42.133
- Morning, Peter.
- Come on, hurry up.

37:42.166 --> 37:43.868
- Go on the camera.
- Get over there, come on.

37:43.902 --> 37:44.802
For what?

37:44.836 --> 37:46.671
- Shut up, fucker.
- Turn on camera two.

37:46.704 --> 37:48.072
Get, both of you.

37:48.106 --> 37:49.307
Start it rollin'.

37:49.340 --> 37:51.676
You
guys ready to be famous, hm?

37:51.709 --> 37:52.844
- Hey, let me ask...
- Shut up.

37:52.877 --> 37:54.112
- You wanna keep living?
- I'm sorry.

37:54.145 --> 37:55.079
Don't be sorry, be
scared.

37:55.113 --> 37:56.147
That's my daughter,
just please,

37:56.180 --> 37:58.783
- let me get her outta here.
- Get against the wall.

37:58.816 --> 38:00.018
- Please.
- Just keep your eyes closed

38:00.051 --> 38:01.119
and everything's gonna be okay.

38:01.152 --> 38:02.921
God, you're smothering them.

38:02.954 --> 38:04.421
I guess that's the point.

38:05.189 --> 38:06.758
There, we're done.

38:08.492 --> 38:10.094
Students and
faculty of Arcadia High.

38:10.128 --> 38:14.165
Every day in your classrooms,
your locker rooms,

38:14.198 --> 38:18.870
your parking lots, your
hallways, somebody is attacked.

38:18.903 --> 38:21.706
Students and faculty of Arcadia
High,

38:21.739 --> 38:25.877
every day in your classrooms,
your locker rooms,

38:25.910 --> 38:29.180
your parking lots, your
hallways.

38:29.213 --> 38:32.016
Students and faculty of Arcadia
High,

38:32.050 --> 38:35.820
every day in your classrooms,
your locker rooms,

38:35.853 --> 38:40.191
your parking lots, your
hallways, somebody is attacked.

38:40.224 --> 38:42.160
Students and faculty.

38:42.193 --> 38:44.929
Students and faculty of Arcadia
High,

38:44.963 --> 38:49.067
every day in your classrooms,
your locker rooms,

38:49.100 --> 38:51.869
your parking lots, your
hallways.

38:53.037 --> 38:55.773
Students and faculty of Arcadia
High,

38:55.807 --> 39:00.011
every day in your classrooms,
in your locker rooms,

39:00.044 --> 39:02.914
your parking lots, your
hallways, somebody is attacked.

39:02.947 --> 39:05.615
Okay, I'm officially fuckin'
trippin'.

39:05.650 --> 39:07.617
This ends now, come on.

39:07.652 --> 39:09.921
- Every day in your classrooms
- It's right here.

39:09.954 --> 39:12.690
Your locker
rooms, your parking lots,

39:12.724 --> 39:15.760
your hallways, somebody is
attacked.

39:15.793 --> 39:18.595
Students and faculty of Arcadia
High,

39:18.629 --> 39:22.734
every day in your classrooms,
your locker rooms,

39:22.767 --> 39:24.135
your parking lots, your
hallways...

39:24.168 --> 39:26.137
- It's one of them.
- Somebody is attacked.

39:26.170 --> 39:28.306
Attacked and made to feel
useless,

39:28.339 --> 39:29.741
humiliated, and miserable.

39:29.774 --> 39:32.744
Why, because no one sees.

39:32.777 --> 39:34.946
Well take a look, and learn.

39:34.979 --> 39:38.016
We are the four horsemen
of the apocalypse,

39:38.049 --> 39:42.053
and the great day of our wrath
has come.

39:42.086 --> 39:43.154
Why us?

39:43.187 --> 39:44.088
Hey, hey.

39:44.122 --> 39:46.090
Look at me, look at me.

39:46.124 --> 39:49.127
You're gonna make such a
pretty, pretty redhead.

39:50.695 --> 39:53.164
Give my gun a BJ,
come on.

39:54.065 --> 39:56.868
Do it good, and I'll let
you know before it spits.

39:58.703 --> 39:59.804
That's Sammy Tisdale.

40:00.705 --> 40:02.640
I fuckin' hated that guy.

40:02.673 --> 40:03.674
Hated?

40:03.708 --> 40:05.276
- She's just a little girl,
- Please, please,

40:05.309 --> 40:07.345
- Let her go back to her mom.
- Listen to me.

40:07.378 --> 40:08.713
This wasn't part of
the plan.

40:08.746 --> 40:10.114
- Move out of the way.
- Stay here.

40:10.148 --> 40:11.716
Put the gun, put the
guns down...

40:11.749 --> 40:13.084
What the fuck?

40:13.117 --> 40:16.654
Everyone in this building
is an enemy combatant.

40:16.687 --> 40:18.256
You can't take
her, she's my daughter,

40:18.289 --> 40:19.957
- she's a baby, please!
- No one leaves this building.

40:19.991 --> 40:20.892
Stay back!

40:20.925 --> 40:21.993
No one.

40:22.026 --> 40:23.327
- Get back!
- Please, keep the guns

40:23.361 --> 40:24.729
- from by baby.
- All right, come on,

40:24.762 --> 40:25.663
come on...

40:26.664 --> 40:27.331
Fuck it.

40:32.203 --> 40:33.771
Hm.

40:33.805 --> 40:36.074
It's cute, but Sam Tisdale
isn't dead.

40:36.107 --> 40:38.076
He would die before he blew a
gun.

40:38.109 --> 40:39.911
Just proves he's in on it.

40:39.944 --> 40:42.647
I don't think he would do
it if it was just a joke,

40:42.680 --> 40:44.015
- you know...
- It's a trick.

40:44.048 --> 40:45.783
I think it happened.

40:45.817 --> 40:49.720
That's why I saw Miss
Persephone's, and the girl.

40:50.755 --> 40:51.956
- Girl?
- Yeah, what girl?

40:51.989 --> 40:53.357
Well there was a girl there.

40:53.391 --> 40:55.693
I think that's what they
were fighting about.

40:57.728 --> 40:59.964
Rewind it, that's Miss
Persephone's daughter.

41:04.702 --> 41:06.337
These don't connect to
anything.

41:06.370 --> 41:08.873
I saw some shit too when I
was in the kitchen, I saw Gus.

41:08.906 --> 41:11.209
Because the people with
the fucking gas masks

41:11.242 --> 41:13.044
are pumping something in
here to make us hallucinate,

41:13.077 --> 41:14.745
some sort of agent.

41:14.779 --> 41:16.647
Why do you think they're cranking
the heat all of a sudden?

41:16.681 --> 41:18.216
The air's on, the water,

41:18.249 --> 41:19.951
Miss Persephone handed it out in
the van,

41:19.984 --> 41:22.220
we couldn't even drive
our own cars, remember?

41:22.253 --> 41:23.087
Now we're locked in.

41:24.689 --> 41:26.324
Probably don't want us to hurt
ourselves.

41:26.357 --> 41:28.226
Huh, you're not that
important, Scottie.

41:28.259 --> 41:29.427
Come on, don't do
that.

41:29.460 --> 41:30.895
I need to. Get the fuck...

41:30.928 --> 41:32.130
Look, we'll go into
the office...

41:32.163 --> 41:33.197
- No.
- What're you?

41:33.231 --> 41:34.232
I'll take you to the nurse...

41:34.265 --> 41:35.333
- No.
- And I'll...

41:35.366 --> 41:36.734
- No, no.
- Don't cut me.

41:36.767 --> 41:37.969
Fine, fuck you!

41:39.003 --> 41:41.239
Bleed to death, fuck.

41:41.272 --> 41:42.373
Let me see your
hand.

41:44.709 --> 41:45.409
Goodbye, Peter.

41:55.052 --> 41:56.454
Hold on, it's
Duncan.

41:56.487 --> 41:59.223
Where're you goin'?

42:00.358 --> 42:02.760
It's on zombies!

42:06.164 --> 42:08.065
We were
just suppose to scare them.

42:08.099 --> 42:09.367
Oh come on,

42:09.400 --> 42:10.935
what do you think you put in the
vents?

42:10.968 --> 42:12.436
A smoke
bomb.

42:12.470 --> 42:14.805
A smoke
bomb, ha, stop that.

42:16.741 --> 42:19.177
Listen, this one's getting
squeamish,

42:19.210 --> 42:22.880
I need you to babysit,
I'm late for gym class.

42:25.082 --> 42:26.450
It's not too
late.

42:26.484 --> 42:29.153
We can shut off the
fans, we can stop this.

42:32.523 --> 42:35.092
Emily, Emily, Emily!

42:41.165 --> 42:42.033
Emily!

42:47.305 --> 42:48.739
- Emily!
- You know,

42:48.773 --> 42:50.107
you're breathing like you used
to

42:50.141 --> 42:51.842
when I would come into your room
at night.

42:51.876 --> 42:53.778
You're, you're dead.

42:55.446 --> 42:57.815
That's how I knew that you
were as excited as I was.

42:57.848 --> 42:59.750
You're not here.

42:59.784 --> 43:02.186
Oh I am, Alice, I am.

43:02.220 --> 43:05.389
Baby you smell just
like your mother used to

43:05.423 --> 43:07.124
when she was in heat.

43:07.158 --> 43:08.359
Mouse.

43:08.392 --> 43:09.260
Run!

43:10.261 --> 43:12.029
- Please, I don't want you
- Come, come here.

43:12.063 --> 43:14.065
to hurt anybody.

43:20.171 --> 43:21.539
What do you want?

43:25.142 --> 43:26.777
Get off of me!

44:19.030 --> 44:20.064
Anybody gets in my way now,

44:20.097 --> 44:21.132
I'm gonna fuckin' kill 'em,

44:21.165 --> 44:22.400
I don't give a shit who they
are.

44:28.205 --> 44:29.073
Shit.

44:48.526 --> 44:51.329
They do this to you in juvie
too?

45:01.105 --> 45:04.041
Emily, Emily?

45:04.075 --> 45:06.944
Mouse.

45:06.977 --> 45:09.080
Emily.

45:09.113 --> 45:10.481
You're gonna have to go
and find the girls, man.

45:10.514 --> 45:12.249
What about you?

45:12.283 --> 45:13.984
Meet me in the auditorium,
we can leave from there.

45:14.018 --> 45:16.354
No, no, no, what if I
don't wanna leave, huh?

45:16.387 --> 45:18.155
What if I wanna fuck someone up?

45:19.023 --> 45:23.060
Who are you gonna fuck
up in an empty school?

45:23.094 --> 45:24.428
Four dudes?

45:24.462 --> 45:26.097
This has gone beyond all that.

45:26.130 --> 45:29.567
They have Emily hacking herself
to pieces.

45:32.436 --> 45:36.207
Mouse, is losing her god damn
mind.

45:36.240 --> 45:40.878
Fuck that, get the girls, I'll
have us out in 10 minutes.

45:41.680 --> 45:45.116
Then next week, when classes
start,

45:46.150 --> 45:48.919
we come back, loaded for bear,

45:48.953 --> 45:51.889
and everyone in this bitch
pays for what happened tonight.

45:56.193 --> 45:58.630
I saw my dad out in the
hallway.

46:00.264 --> 46:05.269
I saw him like I saw Persephone.

46:06.070 --> 46:08.506
I saw him like I saw Mouse.

46:09.708 --> 46:11.676
Maybe you're seeing spirits.

46:11.710 --> 46:12.576
Yeah.

46:13.978 --> 46:16.113
Oh god, oh god.

46:16.147 --> 46:17.615
Oh, no, oh.

46:18.717 --> 46:20.084
How did you get in here?

46:20.117 --> 46:21.952
How did you get here?

46:21.986 --> 46:23.287
I'm gonna take these off,
okay?

46:23.320 --> 46:24.188
Okay.

46:26.023 --> 46:29.927
Emily, Mouse.

46:31.663 --> 46:35.667
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit.

46:49.180 --> 46:51.248
Sam Tisdale isn't dead.

46:52.516 --> 46:53.984
Just proves he's in on it.

46:54.686 --> 46:55.887
He's helping them.

46:55.921 --> 46:58.222
If you've done anything to
Emily, I'll kill you for real.

46:58.255 --> 47:00.024
He would die before he blew a
gun.

48:00.819 --> 48:03.153
He's coming, run!

48:32.684 --> 48:34.184
Please, please don't do...

48:59.143 --> 49:00.712
Ah, fuck it.

49:05.316 --> 49:06.483
S-s-s-suck it.

49:06.517 --> 49:07.886
S-s-s-suck it.

49:07.919 --> 49:09.788
Come on, F-f-f-fag.

49:12.323 --> 49:14.458
Watch, oh wait, watch this.

49:15.894 --> 49:18.162
Are you fuckin' tinkling, you
tinkling?

49:18.195 --> 49:19.530
Come on, look Phil, look
at this.

49:19.563 --> 49:20.865
- Look at this.
- Look at that,

49:20.899 --> 49:22.366
look at that, look at
that, it's beautiful.

49:23.367 --> 49:24.869
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

49:24.903 --> 49:26.604
No, fuck you,
you motherfucking faggot.

49:26.638 --> 49:27.872
Fuck you.

49:27.906 --> 49:29.273
Hey, here's the dungeon
boy's...

49:41.452 --> 49:42.519
Mr. French,

49:46.624 --> 49:47.626
take a seat.

49:49.293 --> 49:51.295
Mr. French, take a seat.

49:55.834 --> 49:56.768
Mr. French.

50:08.379 --> 50:10.715
Now be careful, be careful.

50:12.951 --> 50:14.753
Are you feeling okay?

50:19.824 --> 50:23.293
Oh!

50:23.327 --> 50:24.194
Oh, oh.

50:28.565 --> 50:29.934
They're eating it all away.

50:35.740 --> 50:38.542
Okay, look at, look at
me, look at me, look at me.

50:38.575 --> 50:40.779
Don't look, just don't, just
don't, don't look at that.

50:40.812 --> 50:42.446
Don't look at that at all.

50:48.552 --> 50:49.620
Just look at me, okay?

50:49.654 --> 50:51.388
Just keep looking at me, okay?

50:51.422 --> 50:52.556
It's gonna be,

50:53.590 --> 50:54.626
it's gonna be okay, okay?

50:58.262 --> 50:59.263
You bitch!

51:01.700 --> 51:02.801
Where's my knife, Mouse?

51:02.834 --> 51:04.636
- Emily.
- You took my knife.

51:04.669 --> 51:05.704
No.

51:05.737 --> 51:07.706
We're here because of you.

51:07.739 --> 51:10.607
I don't need a knife to take
care of you.

51:12.010 --> 51:14.411
- You ruined everything.
- Uh!

51:14.445 --> 51:15.479
- Emily.
- You ruined everything,

51:15.512 --> 51:18.415
and I will ruin you!

51:23.620 --> 51:25.355
You're worried about your
father?

51:28.592 --> 51:30.327
You should be worried about me.

51:30.360 --> 51:33.031
Get out of here before I kill
you!

51:33.064 --> 51:34.866
I will ruin you!

51:34.899 --> 51:36.600
She's in the art,

51:36.634 --> 51:38.636
she's in the art studio!

51:39.904 --> 51:44.909
In the art studio.

51:52.917 --> 51:54.719
Don't let them do it.

51:56.320 --> 51:57.655
Get away from me!

52:08.432 --> 52:10.935
You do not give the
orders here, Mr. French.

52:16.875 --> 52:18.442
Look at this fuckin'
locker room

52:18.475 --> 52:20.879
dungeon boy bitch, look
at this fuckin' guy.

52:20.912 --> 52:23.547
Fuck you!

52:24.883 --> 52:27.085
You are not in control, Mr.
French.

52:27.118 --> 52:30.320
Shut up, shut up you all!

52:51.608 --> 52:52.644
Stop!

52:59.684 --> 53:03.487
You will never be in control
again.

53:11.062 --> 53:12.997
Take a drink, take a
drink.

53:13.031 --> 53:15.099
Ah, tastes delicious,
doesn't it?

53:24.676 --> 53:29.681
Scottie!

53:38.723 --> 53:39.791
Sh, sh, sh.

53:41.458 --> 53:45.395
I couldn't, I couldn't,
I couldn't, I couldn't.

54:56.668 --> 54:57.534
Stop!

55:01.239 --> 55:04.976
Invisible, invisible,
invisible.

55:05.009 --> 55:06.610
Invisible.

55:12.083 --> 55:13.617
Shut up!

55:33.570 --> 55:36.941
If you've done anything to
Emily, I'll kill you for real.

55:36.975 --> 55:39.243
I'll kill you for real.

55:39.277 --> 55:41.212
I'll kill you for real.

56:03.234 --> 56:04.068
Scottie?

56:14.812 --> 56:16.214
Where were you?

56:16.247 --> 56:18.082
Where we were the whole time.

56:20.685 --> 56:22.153
Where you're goin'.

56:48.612 --> 56:52.683
I'm so
scared.

57:00.258 --> 57:01.591
Go ahead, go!

57:01.626 --> 57:03.928
Come on, come on.

57:03.961 --> 57:05.263
- Why are you stop...
- Hey, hey,

57:05.296 --> 57:08.232
there's a girl in the vents.

57:08.266 --> 57:09.599
Go on, what are you waitin'?

57:09.634 --> 57:11.202
Get out, get to safety!

57:11.235 --> 57:13.104
There's a girl in
the vent I'm trying to save...

57:26.117 --> 57:27.785
Say thank you.

57:32.990 --> 57:34.859
Fuck you!

57:36.394 --> 57:39.197
Are you one of
us, or are you one of them?

58:04.755 --> 58:06.390
We had a deal Mouse.

58:07.859 --> 58:12.396
I remember it, we help you, you
help us.

58:14.198 --> 58:16.067
But that's not what happened, is
it?

58:17.835 --> 58:19.170
Hm?

58:36.254 --> 58:38.356
There she is,
there's my little girl,

58:39.423 --> 58:42.059
there's my star, come to daddy.

58:42.994 --> 58:44.262
Fuck you, Gus.

58:44.295 --> 58:45.863
Mouse told us about those little
movies

58:45.897 --> 58:47.865
you made her star in, you sick
fuck.

58:47.899 --> 58:48.866
You deserve to die.

58:56.807 --> 58:59.377
Ain't that right, Mouse?

58:59.410 --> 59:01.345
Isn't that what you said, hm?

59:02.980 --> 59:05.082
I'll help kill you all over
again.

59:06.217 --> 59:09.487
I'll help kill everyone in
this school all over again.

59:09.520 --> 59:10.688
I liked it.

59:13.024 --> 59:13.991
End of story.

59:15.126 --> 59:15.993
Ow.

59:20.131 --> 59:21.465
You tried to save the girl.

59:21.499 --> 59:23.401
I'm still trying.

59:50.261 --> 59:54.532
Go, I'll save them, you
don't need to do any more.

01:00:01.138 --> 01:00:04.909
Hi Mouse, Hi Mouse, hi.

01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:10.848
Hi, oh I see ya, I see
ya all right.

01:00:10.881 --> 01:00:12.450
- I see ya now.
- Oh here, Mouse.

01:00:12.483 --> 01:00:13.818
- Louis, Louis, Louis.
- Who is that?

01:00:13.851 --> 01:00:15.319
- You can't catch me.
- Who is that?

01:00:15.353 --> 01:00:16.487
- What, what the hell?
- Ali, ali,

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.990
- Mouse, who is that?
- oxen free.

01:00:20.992 --> 01:00:23.427
Mouse, Mouse, I'm okay.

01:00:23.461 --> 01:00:25.429
I'm okay Mouse, pull me up.

01:00:25.463 --> 01:00:27.265
Mouse, pull me up.

01:00:28.566 --> 01:00:33.037
Uh, uh Mouse.

01:00:33.070 --> 01:00:36.807
Mouse, what the, what the hell?

01:00:36.841 --> 01:00:39.010
You're not real, you're not
real!

01:00:39.043 --> 01:00:39.910
Mouse!

01:00:41.979 --> 01:00:46.450
Mouse!

01:00:46.484 --> 01:00:50.154
Mouse, pull me up, pull me up
now!

01:00:50.187 --> 01:00:52.923
Pull me up now, pull me up now!

01:00:52.957 --> 01:00:56.227
Pull me up now!

01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:13.878
Louis?

01:01:15.479 --> 01:01:19.483
He's dead.

01:01:21.218 --> 01:01:22.086
Come on.

01:01:32.963 --> 01:01:34.298
There's no way out.

01:01:34.332 --> 01:01:35.299
Not here.

01:01:40.471 --> 01:01:42.373
Don't ask me how I know,
but there is a way out

01:01:42.406 --> 01:01:44.542
somewhere in the vent.

01:01:44.575 --> 01:01:46.577
There's a large
one in the science lab,

01:01:46.610 --> 01:01:48.045
we can climb through that.

01:01:51.148 --> 01:01:53.150
She's still in the vents.

01:01:53.184 --> 01:01:54.051
I heard her too.

01:01:57.955 --> 01:02:00.424
I know what you're trying
to do, and I won't let you.

01:02:02.093 --> 01:02:03.894
You can shut off the air
and save everyone else

01:02:03.928 --> 01:02:05.496
in this place, but you can't
save her,

01:02:05.529 --> 01:02:06.665
you're both trapped.

01:02:08.366 --> 01:02:10.067
You'll run out of
bullets.

01:02:10.101 --> 01:02:11.969
Not
before you run out of time.

01:02:45.136 --> 01:02:46.437
Let's go.

01:03:03.254 --> 01:03:05.189
You need to get into the vent.

01:03:05.222 --> 01:03:06.590
Why?

01:03:06.624 --> 01:03:08.192
Because you
think you're better than us.

01:03:08.225 --> 01:03:09.393
You think you're not a killer.

01:03:09.427 --> 01:03:11.262
But you put that bomb there.

01:03:11.295 --> 01:03:14.999
Now no matter what happens,
she's going to die.

01:03:15.032 --> 01:03:15.700
Come on.

01:03:19.370 --> 01:03:21.038
Scottie.

01:03:21.071 --> 01:03:22.139
Scottie.

01:03:22.173 --> 01:03:23.107
- Scottie.
- You thought

01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:23.607
we wouldn't remember.

01:03:23.642 --> 01:03:24.442
Scottie!

01:03:25.309 --> 01:03:26.177
Scottie.

01:03:27.178 --> 01:03:28.312
You thought you could
save that little bitch.

01:03:28.345 --> 01:03:31.515
No, don't do that
Scottie, Scottie, Scottie.

01:03:31.549 --> 01:03:34.351
You can't even save
yourself.

01:03:34.385 --> 01:03:35.586
Scottie.

01:04:06.383 --> 01:04:08.252
- No.
- Yes.

01:04:08.285 --> 01:04:10.187
You've been blooded since we
all took turns with your dad.

01:04:10.221 --> 01:04:11.723
That was the deal, remember?

01:04:11.756 --> 01:04:13.557
We take care of him for you,

01:04:13.591 --> 01:04:16.728
you bring us the keys to
Arcadia and its alarm system.

01:04:16.761 --> 01:04:21.065
Then together, we bring an end
to it, and everyone inside.

01:04:46.257 --> 01:04:49.694
Mouse, he's
wrong, you can save us both.

01:05:01.171 --> 01:05:05.309
The four horsemen of the
apocalypse, draw no distinctions

01:05:13.718 --> 01:05:16.287
You look me in the eyes
and tell me different.

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:17.588
Fine.

01:05:54.626 --> 01:05:55.660
No distinctions.

01:06:03.567 --> 01:06:04.669
I am a killer.

01:06:04.703 --> 01:06:05.804
No!

01:06:15.412 --> 01:06:17.147
Come home Mouse.

01:06:17.181 --> 01:06:19.316
Come home Mouse, we're
family.

01:06:21.585 --> 01:06:23.554
Come along, Mouse.

01:06:23.587 --> 01:06:25.456
Where were you, Mouse?

01:06:45.877 --> 01:06:49.279
Come on, Mouse, we love you so
much.

01:06:58.422 --> 01:06:59.289
Come on!

01:07:04.261 --> 01:07:05.630
It's too late, Mouse.

01:07:09.668 --> 01:07:11.636
You belong with us.

01:07:15.372 --> 01:07:16.507
No, Scottie.

01:07:23.614 --> 01:07:24.749
I belong with the dead ones.

01:08:10.695 --> 01:08:15.232
Sounds like you were having
a nightmare back there.

01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:18.502
I don't do nightmares.

01:08:20.638 --> 01:08:21.973
Sure you don't.

01:08:25.442 --> 01:08:28.846
This whole fucking thing is a
nightmare.

01:08:37.488 --> 01:08:39.590
Tell me again how come
Mouse isn't with us?

01:09:56.935 --> 01:10:01.072
We got one alive, we got a
little girl!

01:12:15.873 --> 01:12:17.008
Cutting.

01:12:17.041 --> 01:12:19.043
That worked so much
better than I'd hoped for.

01:12:20.745 --> 01:12:22.246
Thank you for the good
run

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:23.247
towards the end of that scene.

01:12:23.281 --> 01:12:24.682
Thank you guys so much.

01:12:25.883 --> 01:12:28.219
You were amazing, Clare, Sarah.
