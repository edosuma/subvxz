00:19.201 --> 00:21.001
It's almost 2:00.

00:21.067 --> 00:23.433
You fellows want
to round up the groom?

00:30.067 --> 00:34.433
Bachelor Number One,
you're up!

00:34.500 --> 00:36.367
Hey, Don Juan!

00:36.433 --> 00:40.168
Your new ball-and-chain
is waiting.

00:40.234 --> 00:41.567
What do you say?

00:49.567 --> 00:51.001
Come on, man.

00:51.067 --> 00:53.001
Time to flush and go.

00:53.067 --> 00:55.168
Your future ex is waiting.

00:55.234 --> 00:56.567
You find him?

00:58.567 --> 01:00.767
I think he's wringing it out.

01:03.834 --> 01:05.801
Come on, man.
What's the deal?

01:05.867 --> 01:07.467
You fall in?

01:08.734 --> 01:09.667
You okay?

01:12.234 --> 01:13.867
Knock it down.

01:15.534 --> 01:16.867
I'm coming in, man.

01:25.634 --> 01:28.467
Oh, man.

01:28.534 --> 01:29.967
What are you doing?

01:40.901 --> 01:44.168
Talk to me.

01:44.234 --> 01:46.168
No. It's nothing.

01:46.234 --> 01:47.901
Nonsense.

01:50.234 --> 01:51.934
Nonsense.

03:14.954 --> 03:18.220
Rise and shine.

03:18.287 --> 03:19.554
Up and at 'em.

03:21.887 --> 03:22.821
Morning.

03:22.887 --> 03:24.721
School. Yay.

03:26.454 --> 03:27.921
No fair, sweet pea.

03:27.988 --> 03:29.988
I just called in your room
for you to wake up.

03:30.054 --> 03:33.054
How long have you been out here?

03:33.120 --> 03:34.120
I don't know.

03:34.187 --> 03:35.187
I couldn't sleep.

03:35.253 --> 03:37.520
I have to do
this oral presentation

03:37.587 --> 03:40.754
on the history of anti-
discrimination legislation

03:40.821 --> 03:41.787
and I know I'm not

03:41.854 --> 03:42.988
going to do
very well.

03:43.054 --> 03:44.153
You don't know that.

03:44.220 --> 03:45.220
Oh, yes, I do.

03:45.287 --> 03:46.487
There are kids in my class

03:46.554 --> 03:48.153
that have been working
on theirs for weeks.

03:48.220 --> 03:50.587
Weeks, Ariel?

03:50.654 --> 03:52.287
Doesn't actually
require weeks.

03:52.354 --> 03:54.088
It's just, some kids are nuts.

03:54.153 --> 03:55.921
Besides that it's just

03:55.988 --> 03:57.187
some kind of contest.

03:57.253 --> 03:58.520
The top three kids
in our school

03:58.587 --> 04:00.187
get to go to the state assembly

04:00.253 --> 04:02.287
and make their presentations
in front of our assemblyman.

04:02.354 --> 04:04.354
Wow.

04:04.420 --> 04:06.554
Mom, you don't get it.

04:06.621 --> 04:08.554
I don't care.

04:08.621 --> 04:10.454
But a lot
of the other kids do.

04:10.520 --> 04:13.287
And that's just going
to make me look worse.

04:14.754 --> 04:17.220
I'm sure you're
going to do fine.

04:17.286 --> 04:19.320
That's Mr. Cathcart's
class, right?

04:19.387 --> 04:20.786
You always do
well in there.

04:20.853 --> 04:21.786
He likes you.

04:21.853 --> 04:23.721
Good morning.

04:25.387 --> 04:28.120
Or am I being hasty?

04:40.654 --> 04:42.687
DEVALOS:
We believe they were mules--

04:42.754 --> 04:44.354
impoverished foreign nationals

04:44.420 --> 04:47.021
hired by drug dealers to swallow
condoms filled with heroin,

04:47.088 --> 04:50.120
then fly over to this country
on commercial jetliners

04:50.187 --> 04:52.687
and wait in hotel rooms
to expel the drugs.

04:52.754 --> 04:55.088
What happened
to their eyes?

04:55.153 --> 04:56.153
Gouged out.

04:56.220 --> 04:57.854
Someone's trying
to send a message.

04:57.921 --> 04:59.520
I don't follow.

04:59.587 --> 05:00.854
DEVALOS:
Drugs are a
cyclical business.

05:00.921 --> 05:02.621
One group will control
the trafficking for a while,

05:02.687 --> 05:04.320
then somebody else
will decide it's their turn.

05:04.387 --> 05:05.988
I'm betting whoever

05:06.054 --> 05:07.954
that somebody is that he grabbed
these mules at the airport

05:08.021 --> 05:09.587
before their real employer
could get to them.

05:09.654 --> 05:10.921
Took them to that hotel.

05:10.988 --> 05:12.454
Sliced 'em in half,
rather than wait

05:12.520 --> 05:13.988
for nature to deliver
the merchandise,

05:14.054 --> 05:15.054
then ripped
out their eyes

05:15.120 --> 05:16.354
just for good measure.

05:16.420 --> 05:17.654
Detective Scanlon
has quite a bit

05:17.721 --> 05:19.354
of experience
in these matters.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.088
Three years ago he headed
up an undercover unit

05:21.153 --> 05:22.287
that helped stem a great deal
of drug trafficking

05:22.354 --> 05:23.754
here in the Southwest.

05:23.821 --> 05:25.253
Well, good.
Then maybe he can tell me

05:25.320 --> 05:26.887
how much more of this
we can expect.

05:26.954 --> 05:28.520
It's not like the weather.

05:28.587 --> 05:29.921
No one can tell you

05:29.988 --> 05:31.687
when it's going to blow over.

05:31.754 --> 05:33.921
I think what our new
deputy mayor is asking...
I know what she's asking.

05:33.988 --> 05:35.587
She wants to know how messy
it's going to get:

05:35.654 --> 05:37.187
if we keep it downtown

05:37.253 --> 05:38.887
where nobody really sees it,
where nobody really cares,

05:38.954 --> 05:40.287
or if it's gonna rear
its ugly head

05:40.354 --> 05:41.487
in the nice neighborhoods

05:41.554 --> 05:42.821
where people actually
go to the polls

05:42.887 --> 05:43.887
and sometimes even make

05:43.954 --> 05:46.387
campaign
contributions.

05:49.621 --> 05:51.320
We'll do our best.

05:54.454 --> 05:55.587
Hi.

05:55.654 --> 05:56.921
Hiya.

05:58.921 --> 06:00.754
So how goes the new job?

06:00.821 --> 06:02.253
Well, it would go a lot better

06:02.320 --> 06:03.988
if people would stop
killing people.

06:07.621 --> 06:10.088
Hey, Deputy Doll,
how's the coffee?

06:10.153 --> 06:11.187
Could you not?

06:11.253 --> 06:13.721
Hmm? Could I not "what"?

06:13.787 --> 06:15.954
It's important to be
specific about these things.

06:16.021 --> 06:17.821
There's all kinds of laws
about how to deal

06:17.887 --> 06:19.387
with the opposite sex
in the workplace

06:19.454 --> 06:22.420
and I don't want to run
afoul of any of them.

06:27.687 --> 06:28.687
You can see the future.

06:28.754 --> 06:29.687
What are my chances?

06:29.754 --> 06:31.220
You're not serious.

06:31.287 --> 06:32.721
What? You don't think
I was charming?

06:32.787 --> 06:34.187
It really doesn't matter

06:34.253 --> 06:35.520
what I think.

06:35.587 --> 06:37.554
You're wrong. She's in
the elevator right now

06:37.621 --> 06:38.587
calling her best friend

06:38.654 --> 06:39.988
trying to figure
out what to wear

06:40.054 --> 06:42.554
when I finally
ask her out.

06:42.621 --> 06:43.787
What? That's not
what you see?

06:43.854 --> 06:45.220
You want to know
what I see?

06:45.287 --> 06:47.220
Actually. I had a dream
about you last night.

06:47.287 --> 06:48.354
A really crazy dream.

06:48.420 --> 06:49.487
I have that effect

06:49.554 --> 06:51.021
on women.

06:51.088 --> 06:52.320
I was not in it.

06:52.387 --> 06:54.021
A nightmare. I understand.

06:54.088 --> 06:55.621
You were getting married.

06:55.687 --> 06:56.687
Really?

06:56.754 --> 06:58.253
<i>That is a nightmare.</i>

06:58.320 --> 06:59.821
You were so upset
with going through with it

06:59.887 --> 07:01.854
that you hid in the bathroom
and did drugs.

07:01.921 --> 07:03.854
Okay, get to
the crazy part.

07:03.921 --> 07:05.520
<i>That is crazy. It is.</i>

07:05.587 --> 07:08.187
Do I look like a guy who's
ever contemplated marriage?

07:08.253 --> 07:10.287
Do I look like a guy
who's ever done drugs?

07:10.354 --> 07:13.520
Okay, I'm going back
to the station house.

07:13.587 --> 07:16.253
Wait for a call
from the deputy mayor.

07:17.554 --> 07:20.387
...and so we have all of
these anti-discrimination laws

07:20.454 --> 07:22.988
that make America
a better place to live.

07:23.054 --> 07:24.587
Very nice, Ariel.

07:27.621 --> 07:28.887
Terrence Bock.

07:38.287 --> 07:39.754
Do you see all those cards?

07:55.587 --> 07:56.921
Terrence?

07:59.921 --> 08:02.387
The history of discrimination
in the United States

08:02.454 --> 08:04.021
and the progression
of legislative remedies

08:04.088 --> 08:06.220
created by the various
branches of government

08:06.287 --> 08:08.320
assigned the task
of safeguarding the rights

08:08.387 --> 08:11.253
of each and every citizen
provides a moving portrait

08:11.320 --> 08:13.787
of contemporary democracy
in action.

08:17.088 --> 08:20.754
In the next 15 minutes,
I will attempt to demonstrate

08:20.821 --> 08:24.054
how the constant evolution
of anti-discrimination laws

08:24.120 --> 08:26.253
in the United States
has helped to change

08:26.320 --> 08:28.253
the way we live as Americans.

08:33.354 --> 08:39.453
1,095 days without drugs.

08:39.520 --> 08:43.220
Three years.

08:43.287 --> 08:47.487
Everyone in this room knows
what a monumental event that is.

08:47.554 --> 08:51.054
It's quite a milestone
for this man.

08:51.120 --> 08:53.088
And I couldn't be more proud.

08:53.153 --> 08:55.487
Lee?

08:55.554 --> 08:57.153
Here's a little
something for you

08:57.220 --> 08:58.821
to add to your charm bracelet.

09:12.253 --> 09:14.621
My name's Lee.
I'm a drug addict.

09:14.687 --> 09:16.587
ALL:
Hi, Lee.

10:37.254 --> 10:38.754
Is everything okay?

10:40.387 --> 10:43.854
Yeah. I don't know.

10:43.921 --> 10:48.120
I guess...
I guess I had a nightmare.

10:48.187 --> 10:53.521
Wow. I don't think I've ever
heard you use that word before.

10:53.587 --> 10:56.787
Detective Scanlon was in it.

10:56.854 --> 10:59.921
His eyes were gouged out.

10:59.988 --> 11:02.254
Like those women
in the newspaper?

11:04.754 --> 11:06.754
What you doing?

11:06.821 --> 11:08.254
Hmm?

11:08.320 --> 11:09.787
I don't know.

11:09.854 --> 11:12.153
I think maybe
I should give him a call.

11:12.220 --> 11:14.120
And tell him what?

11:14.187 --> 11:16.220
About some nightmare?

11:16.287 --> 11:18.888
It's 2:00
in the morning.

11:18.954 --> 11:22.487
No. You're right.

11:22.554 --> 11:24.120
What was I thinking?

11:25.487 --> 11:28.888
It'll hold till morning.

11:28.954 --> 11:32.787
It'll definitely hold
till morning.

11:50.153 --> 11:51.687
Don't do that.

11:51.754 --> 11:53.821
Save that stuff
for people you like.

11:55.387 --> 11:57.420
Good morning
to you, too.

12:00.687 --> 12:03.521
I know you want me to think
it was some giant coincidence

12:03.587 --> 12:05.020
you showed up
at the meeting last night,

12:05.087 --> 12:06.454
but I don't believe
in coincidences.

12:06.521 --> 12:10.220
No. You're wrong.

12:10.287 --> 12:13.153
Look, I heard you were going
to be three years clean.

12:13.220 --> 12:16.053
I'm two and a half.

12:16.120 --> 12:18.487
Can't a friend root
for a friend?

12:22.420 --> 12:25.320
Okay, fine.
I need a favor.

12:25.387 --> 12:26.954
I already did you one.

12:27.020 --> 12:28.787
Feel free to leave
anytime you want.

12:28.854 --> 12:30.888
Oh, you're cold.

12:30.954 --> 12:32.954
You got a heart
of ice.

12:33.020 --> 12:34.721
You froze it, honey.

12:34.787 --> 12:36.187
Well, get over it.

12:36.254 --> 12:37.821
People get engaged
every day.

12:37.888 --> 12:39.354
Sometimes it doesn't
work out.

12:39.420 --> 12:41.020
You set me up.
You knew who I was.

12:41.087 --> 12:42.687
You knew what I did
for a living.

12:42.754 --> 12:44.254
And you knew
who I was.

12:44.320 --> 12:48.487
Nice girl from
a nice family.

12:48.554 --> 12:50.621
Yeah, that's some family.

12:50.687 --> 12:52.420
I would
have told you.

12:52.487 --> 12:54.387
When? Before
or after the wedding?

12:56.220 --> 12:58.254
Hmm?

12:58.320 --> 12:59.420
Before or after
I was called

12:59.487 --> 13:01.220
to testify against them?

13:06.087 --> 13:07.621
What's the favor?

13:09.254 --> 13:13.020
Those were our mules somebody
sliced and diced the other day.

13:13.087 --> 13:15.120
Do you know anything?

13:18.053 --> 13:19.621
You honestly think,
if I knew something,

13:19.687 --> 13:21.220
I'd tell you?

13:22.921 --> 13:25.654
It would be good
for both of us, Lee.

13:27.087 --> 13:29.854
Get out of here.

13:29.921 --> 13:33.320
Get your clothes,
and get out of here.

13:36.854 --> 13:39.020
No, no, sweetie.

13:39.087 --> 13:41.687
No. Those are the cards
from Ariel's report.

13:41.754 --> 13:45.020
It's okay. I told her
she could have them.

13:46.454 --> 13:48.287
Daddy!

13:48.354 --> 13:50.988
Is that for me? Thank you.

13:51.053 --> 13:53.153
No. This one.
This one.

13:53.220 --> 13:55.187
Oh, that one. Okay.

13:55.254 --> 13:56.988
I don't understand.

13:57.053 --> 13:58.988
Last night, you said
the presentation went well.

13:59.053 --> 14:01.053
It did. But it's not
like it was so good

14:01.120 --> 14:03.120
that they're going to send me
to the State Assembly.

14:03.187 --> 14:05.220
Mama!

14:05.287 --> 14:06.921
Thank you very much.

14:06.988 --> 14:09.454
Honey, if you do win,

14:09.521 --> 14:12.153
you're going to have
to write these all over again.

14:12.220 --> 14:13.754
I'm not going to win.

14:13.821 --> 14:15.454
Terrence Bock is going to win.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.354
His presentation was way
longer than anybody else's,

14:17.420 --> 14:20.254
and he practically
had it memorized.

14:20.320 --> 14:21.621
Well, I'm sure
he did a good job,

14:21.687 --> 14:22.988
but we still don't know.

14:23.053 --> 14:24.888
Oh, yes, I do.

14:24.954 --> 14:26.687
Terrence Bock is going to win.

14:28.487 --> 14:30.521
You looking
for me?

14:30.587 --> 14:31.554
Yeah. Lee, come on in.

14:31.621 --> 14:33.187
What's up?

14:33.254 --> 14:35.254
You making any progress

14:35.320 --> 14:37.821
identifying those three mules
that died the other night?

14:37.888 --> 14:39.754
Surprise, surprise.
Their fingerprints and DNA

14:39.821 --> 14:41.787
don't match anything
we had on file.

14:41.854 --> 14:44.187
We reached out to the
appropriate foreign governments,

14:44.254 --> 14:46.787
and they contacted
their law
enforcement agencies,

14:46.854 --> 14:47.921
but it's going
to be a while

14:47.988 --> 14:49.954
before anyone
gets back to us.

14:50.020 --> 14:51.854
What?

14:51.921 --> 14:53.420
I got the damnedest call

14:53.487 --> 14:55.020
from a friend
in the coroner's office.

14:55.087 --> 14:56.787
Their official report
won't be out

14:56.854 --> 14:58.320
for another couple of hours,

14:58.387 --> 15:01.120
but one of these murdered girls

15:01.187 --> 15:03.254
doesn't quite fit the profile
of your typical drug mule.

15:03.320 --> 15:04.754
How's that?

15:04.821 --> 15:06.921
When was the last time
you ran into a dirt-poor girl

15:06.988 --> 15:09.053
from Latin America
with a nose job?

15:09.120 --> 15:11.087
Excuse me?

15:11.153 --> 15:13.087
One of these mules appears
to have had cosmetic surgery.

15:13.153 --> 15:14.988
A rhinoplasty.

15:15.053 --> 15:16.621
And, in the coroner's
estimation,

15:16.687 --> 15:18.420
quite an expensive one.

15:18.487 --> 15:20.254
In addition, she's sporting
a very high-end set

15:20.320 --> 15:22.754
of dental laminates.

15:22.821 --> 15:24.187
Not the kind of thing
one would expect

15:24.254 --> 15:25.888
from someone so impoverished
that they're willing

15:25.954 --> 15:28.621
to swallow capsules
of heroin for money.

15:34.821 --> 15:36.387
I'm worried about you.

15:36.454 --> 15:38.621
Hello, stranger.

15:38.687 --> 15:40.721
I had another
dream about you.

15:40.787 --> 15:43.521
Maybe I'm the one who
should be worried about you.

15:43.587 --> 15:45.354
It was kind of nutty.

15:45.420 --> 15:47.754
You were with this
really exotic woman.

15:47.821 --> 15:49.521
Nothing nutty about that.

15:49.587 --> 15:51.053
And she gouged
your eyes out

15:51.120 --> 15:52.787
with her thumbs,
like those mules.

15:54.687 --> 15:57.954
Come on. I'm waiting for you
to say something funny back.

16:00.053 --> 16:02.254
I don't quite
know what to say.

16:02.320 --> 16:03.888
I'm at a loss for words.

16:03.954 --> 16:06.387
Truth is, I make all
my exotic women friends
wear boxing gloves.

16:06.454 --> 16:08.187
Ah, ha, ha!

16:08.254 --> 16:10.020
Hey, I appreciate
the tip.

16:10.087 --> 16:13.087
Oh, hey, did Deputy Doll
ever get back to you?

16:13.153 --> 16:16.020
Wow. First,
you gouge out my eyes,

16:16.087 --> 16:19.287
then you rip out my heart.

16:19.354 --> 16:21.287
Overall,
I was very impressed

16:21.354 --> 16:23.087
with everyone's
presentations.

16:23.153 --> 16:25.988
Obviously, everyone can't go
to the State Assembly

16:26.053 --> 16:28.521
but, ultimately, that's not
what this assignment was about.

16:28.587 --> 16:30.287
Ultimately,

16:30.354 --> 16:31.621
I hope it gave
all of you a chance

16:31.687 --> 16:33.320
to learn about
how the citizens
of this country

16:33.387 --> 16:36.654
compelled their government
to create laws that would

16:36.721 --> 16:39.721
protect and guarantee
equality and fairness

16:39.787 --> 16:41.320
for everyone,

16:41.387 --> 16:42.487
no matter
who they are,

16:42.554 --> 16:43.654
no matter what
they look like,

16:43.721 --> 16:44.387
no matter
how much money

16:44.454 --> 16:46.587
they make.

16:49.621 --> 16:51.387
This is great.

16:51.454 --> 16:53.020
We're really proud
of you, kiddo.

16:53.087 --> 16:54.220
I don't know.

16:54.287 --> 16:57.220
What is there not to know, huh?

16:57.287 --> 16:58.754
You obviously did a great job.

16:58.821 --> 17:00.187
But I didn't.

17:00.254 --> 17:01.821
I mean, you saw.

17:01.888 --> 17:04.654
I did it the night before
and the morning of.

17:04.721 --> 17:06.621
Well, sometimes...

17:06.686 --> 17:08.420
I can't believe I'm saying this.

17:08.487 --> 17:09.921
Sometimes it isn't about that.

17:09.988 --> 17:11.420
I could use a little help
over here.

17:11.487 --> 17:13.686
I think what your mother's
trying to say

17:13.753 --> 17:16.387
is that preparation
always counts.

17:16.454 --> 17:18.988
But, a lot of times,
in the real world,

17:19.053 --> 17:20.854
it ends up being about
the final product.

17:20.921 --> 17:22.554
And I guess
we have to assume

17:22.621 --> 17:23.621
that your final product--

17:23.686 --> 17:24.988
your presentation--
was the best.

17:25.053 --> 17:26.420
But it wasn't.

17:26.487 --> 17:27.887
Terrence's was.

17:27.954 --> 17:29.921
Well, that's your
opinion, honey.

17:29.988 --> 17:33.120
But, apparently,
Mr. Cathcart doesn't agree.

17:33.187 --> 17:35.220
Wait a second.
Who is this "Terrence"?

17:35.287 --> 17:36.721
Is he some boy you like?

17:36.787 --> 17:39.020
Dad!

17:39.087 --> 17:40.621
I'm just asking.

17:40.687 --> 17:43.587
No. No one likes him.

17:43.654 --> 17:45.220
He's not the kind of boy
girls like.

17:45.287 --> 17:46.654
He's kind of icky.

17:46.721 --> 17:49.587
But his presentation

17:49.654 --> 17:50.854
was so good.

17:50.921 --> 17:52.420
He's like somebody
you'd see on one of those

17:52.487 --> 17:56.287
boring cable shows or something,
talking about history.

17:56.354 --> 17:59.988
I just keep thinking that
Mr. Cathcart made a mistake.

18:01.654 --> 18:03.287
Well, then, you need
to talk to him about it.

18:03.354 --> 18:05.454
Either he will convince you
that you did a great job

18:05.521 --> 18:07.821
or you'll convince him
otherwise.

18:17.888 --> 18:20.621
Hey. Thanks for coming.

18:29.354 --> 18:33.354
It's cold out, Lee,
and it's late.

18:33.420 --> 18:35.087
You kicked me out
of your bed
this morning,

18:35.153 --> 18:38.087
and then you call me
and tell me to come over.

18:38.153 --> 18:39.420
What's going on?

18:39.487 --> 18:40.754
Nothing's going on.

18:40.821 --> 18:42.621
You asked me
if I could find out

18:42.687 --> 18:44.120
who might have
done this thing.

18:44.187 --> 18:45.354
You know?

18:45.420 --> 18:48.420
I'm working on it.

18:48.487 --> 18:50.354
I got to ask you
a question though.

18:53.087 --> 18:54.654
Do you know these girls?

18:54.721 --> 18:56.454
You know their names?

18:56.521 --> 18:58.020
Their names?
They're mules.

18:58.087 --> 18:59.420
I don't know
their names.

18:59.487 --> 19:00.787
They're recruited
over there.

19:00.854 --> 19:01.988
I mean, whoever did this,
they took their passports.

19:02.053 --> 19:03.587
They took their ticket stubs.

19:03.654 --> 19:05.387
We went through that hotel
with a fine-tooth comb,

19:05.454 --> 19:06.854
and we couldn't find a thing.

19:06.921 --> 19:08.087
Wait a second.

19:08.153 --> 19:09.687
Do you know something,

19:09.754 --> 19:11.687
or are you trying
to find something out?

19:11.754 --> 19:14.153
I know this: I know it's
too early to be waging a war

19:14.220 --> 19:16.387
against whoever you think
it is might be responsible.

19:16.454 --> 19:19.120
You're confusing me.
What are you saying?

19:19.187 --> 19:21.754
I'm saying something's
starting to smell funny.

19:21.821 --> 19:23.454
Something caught
the coroner's eye this morning.

19:23.521 --> 19:25.020
I didn't think much
of it at first.

19:25.087 --> 19:26.521
Maybe it's something.
Maybe it's nothing.

19:26.587 --> 19:28.988
What are you
talking about?

19:29.053 --> 19:30.487
I'm not entirely sure.

19:30.554 --> 19:32.888
All I know is
something isn't adding up,

19:32.954 --> 19:34.921
and I'd hate to see a lot
of innocent people die

19:34.988 --> 19:38.721
and a lot of blood
get spilled for no reason.

19:38.787 --> 19:40.420
Talk to who you
need to talk to.
Buy me some time.

19:40.487 --> 19:41.821
Let me get
to the bottom of this.

19:44.220 --> 19:45.721
What?

19:48.654 --> 19:51.687
You know, we could
have had this
conversation in bed.

19:51.754 --> 19:55.487
Someone I work with told me to
be careful with women like you

19:55.554 --> 19:57.521
or I might just end up
like one of your mules.

19:57.587 --> 20:00.087
They should mind
their own business.

20:00.153 --> 20:02.687
I'll talk to whoever
I need to talk to.

20:02.754 --> 20:05.587
I'll try to
calm things down.

20:05.654 --> 20:07.220
I appreciate it.

20:11.754 --> 20:13.454
Last chance.

20:15.220 --> 20:17.187
Don't tempt me.

20:33.404 --> 20:35.338
Mr. Cathcart?

20:35.404 --> 20:36.837
Ariel. Come on in.

20:36.904 --> 20:38.237
What can I
help you with?

20:38.304 --> 20:40.670
It's about the presentation,
the trip.

20:40.737 --> 20:43.137
Oh, you know what?

20:43.204 --> 20:44.870
I don't actually
have the packet yet.

20:44.937 --> 20:47.104
Uh, the permission slips and the
information for your parents--

20:47.171 --> 20:48.971
I'm still waiting for it
to come from the central office.

20:49.037 --> 20:51.770
Uh, no. That-That's not it.

20:51.837 --> 20:54.737
Um, I was really surprised
that you picked me.

20:55.770 --> 20:58.037
Come sit down.

21:00.004 --> 21:02.704
Why are you surprised
that I would pick you?

21:04.537 --> 21:06.570
Well, I guess I just didn't
think I was the best.

21:06.637 --> 21:08.870
What, you think someone
else's was better?

21:08.937 --> 21:10.404
Whose?

21:10.470 --> 21:12.570
Terrence Bock's.

21:17.971 --> 21:19.171
Terrence Bock?

21:19.237 --> 21:20.737
You're kidding.

21:20.804 --> 21:23.004
That boy disgusts me.

21:23.071 --> 21:25.271
Terrence Bock
is a very bright boy.

21:25.338 --> 21:28.570
Uh, his research
was very detailed.

21:28.637 --> 21:30.804
I just look at him,
and I get depressed.

21:30.870 --> 21:32.937
You know he's going
to spend his life alone.

21:33.004 --> 21:37.870
But a presentation is more than
just the collection of data.

21:37.937 --> 21:39.804
You know, its effectiveness
often hinges

21:39.870 --> 21:41.603
on a lot of intangibles.

21:41.670 --> 21:42.837
But does he ever wash?

21:42.904 --> 21:44.204
Have you ever seen him

21:44.271 --> 21:46.037
when there wasn't something
in his nose?

21:46.104 --> 21:49.004
Likability,
the attractiveness of the person

21:49.071 --> 21:51.037
making the presentation.

21:51.104 --> 21:53.603
Your willingness
to listen to what
they have to say.

21:53.670 --> 21:55.137
He's repugnant.

21:55.204 --> 21:58.737
Even the word "repugnant"
finds him repugnant.

21:58.804 --> 22:03.438
In all those areas, Ariel,
your work was vastly superior.

22:05.637 --> 22:07.937
Uh, okay.

22:08.004 --> 22:09.470
I hope I answered
your question.

22:09.537 --> 22:11.971
And I hope you're
genuinely as excited
about this as I am.

22:12.037 --> 22:13.737
I think we're going
to have a wonderful day
at the Capitol.

22:13.804 --> 22:16.338
Uh, sure, Mr. Cathcart.

22:19.404 --> 22:21.104
Hey, you got a minute?

22:22.603 --> 22:24.304
What's that expression?

22:24.371 --> 22:25.438
Fool me once, good for you.

22:25.503 --> 22:26.937
Fool me twice...

22:27.004 --> 22:29.204
Hey, what's on your mind?

22:31.637 --> 22:32.937
I don't understand.

22:33.004 --> 22:34.137
You should be
a happy guy.

22:34.204 --> 22:35.438
Two days ago
we all thought

22:35.503 --> 22:37.171
we were staring
at a drug war.

22:37.237 --> 22:38.470
48 hours
have gone by

22:38.537 --> 22:39.770
and nothing's happened.

22:39.837 --> 22:41.603
I know. That's kind
of interesting, isn't it?

22:41.670 --> 22:42.737
Well, I'm just assuming.

22:42.804 --> 22:44.304
I mean, you told me
yesterday

22:44.371 --> 22:45.570
you were going
to talk to some people,

22:45.637 --> 22:46.670
try and cool things off.

22:46.737 --> 22:48.137
You're right:
it was me.

22:48.204 --> 22:50.037
I'm a hero.
I made peace
in the Middle East.

22:50.104 --> 22:51.971
I should run
for President.

22:52.037 --> 22:53.237
You know what?

22:53.304 --> 22:55.137
I have dinner
waiting for me at home,

22:55.204 --> 22:56.537
so if you're not going
to tell me what's
on your mind...

22:56.603 --> 22:58.937
I spent most of the afternoon
with the coroner.

22:59.004 --> 23:00.137
That third mule.

23:00.204 --> 23:02.338
It's not just
a nose job,

23:02.404 --> 23:03.971
not just nice teeth.

23:04.037 --> 23:05.104
She had piercings
in places

23:05.171 --> 23:06.637
I didn't know
you could pierce.

23:06.704 --> 23:09.904
Not something you see
a lot of in Latin America.

23:09.971 --> 23:13.371
Didn't I have
this very conversation
with you yesterday?

23:13.438 --> 23:15.603
<i>( sighing ):
So what are you thinking?</i>

23:15.670 --> 23:17.037
An American girl
in a foreign country

23:17.104 --> 23:19.137
down on her luck
agrees to swallow drugs

23:19.204 --> 23:20.737
for the money to get back home?

23:20.804 --> 23:23.371
Maybe.
Maybe she never left home.

23:23.438 --> 23:24.371
Excuse me?

23:24.438 --> 23:25.670
Pubic hair's blonde.

23:25.737 --> 23:28.071
Didn't have any
when they brought her in.

23:28.137 --> 23:31.304
You know how nails
and hair keep growing
for a couple days after.

23:31.371 --> 23:34.304
I got a hunch
her eyes were blue,

23:34.371 --> 23:36.037
but I guess
we'll never know that.

23:36.104 --> 23:38.503
Tell me where you're going
with this.

23:38.570 --> 23:41.570
Somebody dies
by accident, on purpose...

23:41.637 --> 23:42.704
I don't know.

23:42.770 --> 23:44.937
They need
to get rid of a body.

23:45.004 --> 23:46.171
As luck would have it,
their family happens

23:46.237 --> 23:47.670
to be in the
drug-running business.

23:47.737 --> 23:50.104
So you slaughter two
of your own mules,

23:50.171 --> 23:51.870
girls that no one
will ever miss,

23:51.937 --> 23:53.737
you throw in a third;
everybody assumes

23:53.804 --> 23:55.171
that they come
from the same place,

23:55.237 --> 23:56.937
do the same thing.

23:57.004 --> 23:59.503
And while everybody's looking
for a girl from Latin America,

23:59.570 --> 24:01.570
Jane Doe from somewhere
in the US lies unclaimed

24:01.637 --> 24:02.670
in the coroner's office.

24:02.737 --> 24:04.937
Something like that.

24:05.004 --> 24:06.570
<i>Mom?</i>

24:06.637 --> 24:10.570
Can you come talk to me?

24:10.637 --> 24:13.171
That Mr. Cathcart,

24:13.237 --> 24:16.971
the one who said those horrible
things about Terrence--

24:17.037 --> 24:21.470
I'm pretty sure he wasn't
even in the room today.

24:21.537 --> 24:24.804
You know what I'm talking
about, don't you?

24:24.870 --> 24:28.371
I don't know.
Maybe. Kinda.

24:28.438 --> 24:32.570
I think it might have been
his heart that you heard.

24:32.637 --> 24:34.971
I think it might
have been his soul.

24:35.037 --> 24:39.338
Okay, but what
do I do now?

24:39.404 --> 24:41.470
I don't know.

24:41.537 --> 24:43.071
What do you want
to do?

24:43.137 --> 24:44.971
Shouldn't we tell someone?

24:45.037 --> 24:47.104
Tell them what?

24:47.171 --> 24:48.804
That deep down inside

24:48.870 --> 24:52.470
Mr. Cathcart doesn't like
Terrence?

24:52.537 --> 24:55.770
How would we prove that?

24:55.837 --> 24:57.338
What would we say?

24:57.404 --> 25:00.304
So we just do nothing?

25:00.371 --> 25:01.371
I didn't say that.

25:03.470 --> 25:07.470
Does Terence know how much
you liked his presentation?

25:07.537 --> 25:09.937
No.

25:10.004 --> 25:13.271
I don't talk to Terrence.

25:13.338 --> 25:16.137
Nobody I know talks to Terrence.

25:21.004 --> 25:25.237
What?

25:25.304 --> 25:29.637
I was listening to your heart.

25:29.704 --> 25:31.904
I was listening to your soul.

25:33.404 --> 25:35.171
<i>( doorbell ringing )</i>

25:40.404 --> 25:41.937
Hey, Lee.

25:42.004 --> 25:44.737
I know it's the middle
of the night, but...

25:44.804 --> 25:46.271
What's this?

25:46.338 --> 25:47.904
Search warrant.

25:47.971 --> 25:50.304
You're kidding, right?

25:50.371 --> 25:51.804
Searching for what?

25:51.870 --> 25:53.770
Why don't you just
let us in, Lee?

25:59.937 --> 26:02.637
Appreciate it.

26:02.704 --> 26:04.670
They'll just take
a quick look around,

26:04.737 --> 26:06.071
then we'll be on our way.

26:06.137 --> 26:08.470
Mr. District Attorney?

26:08.537 --> 26:09.637
Excuse me.

26:09.704 --> 26:12.837
Found these
on the night table, sir.

26:26.357 --> 26:27.524
Morning.

26:27.591 --> 26:28.923
Hey, early bird.
What's up?

26:28.990 --> 26:32.057
I'm concerned about
Detective Scanlon.

26:32.124 --> 26:33.758
The last three nights
I've had dreams about him.

26:33.823 --> 26:36.124
Dreams, huh?

26:36.190 --> 26:39.291
Well, let me be the first
to let you down easy.

26:39.357 --> 26:42.524
Office gossip is he's got a yen
for our new deputy mayor.

26:42.591 --> 26:43.658
I'm serious.

26:49.691 --> 26:50.724
Come on, man.

26:50.790 --> 26:52.391
Time to flush and go.

26:52.457 --> 26:53.790
Your future ex is waiting.

26:55.823 --> 26:57.424
DEVALOS:
Lieutenant Greene.

26:57.491 --> 27:01.758
Mr. District Attorney,
may I speak to you for a moment?

27:01.823 --> 27:02.758
In private,

27:02.823 --> 27:04.457
if that's possible.

27:27.624 --> 27:29.923
Sorry to interrupt.

27:29.990 --> 27:32.324
No problem.

27:38.524 --> 27:40.424
Is everything all right?

27:40.491 --> 27:43.724
That, that was
Lieutenant Greene.

27:43.790 --> 27:45.190
He runs Vice.

27:45.257 --> 27:48.391
He came to tell me they finally
ID'd that third mule.

27:48.457 --> 27:50.357
Turns out she wasn't
a mule at all.

27:50.424 --> 27:52.691
She was a police officer--

27:52.758 --> 27:55.658
an undercover police officer.

27:55.724 --> 27:57.257
Jennifer Reed.

27:57.324 --> 28:00.391
Nice girl.

28:00.457 --> 28:02.357
Third-generation
Phoenix PD.

28:02.424 --> 28:04.923
I don't understand.

28:04.990 --> 28:07.291
Someone dyed her hair black,
pulled out her eyes,

28:07.357 --> 28:11.491
threw her in a trash can
with two other mules, and...

28:11.557 --> 28:13.057
they figured
that we'd be so busy

28:13.124 --> 28:17.324
looking for someone
Colombian or Honduran or...

28:17.391 --> 28:20.890
We didn't even know
she was missing.

28:22.923 --> 28:24.391
I'm sorry.

28:24.457 --> 28:25.990
What were we talking about?
Dreams...

28:26.057 --> 28:30.057
I'm going to come back
another time.

28:56.957 --> 28:59.457
Did you know
her well?

28:59.524 --> 29:02.324
Not really.

29:02.391 --> 29:05.224
She worked for Larry
in Vice.

29:05.291 --> 29:08.224
Larry and I
came up together,

29:08.291 --> 29:11.823
undercover work.

29:13.624 --> 29:15.823
No, I didn't know her.

29:15.890 --> 29:18.557
I knew the person
who did this to her, though.

29:18.624 --> 29:22.391
Four years ago or so,
I was deep undercover

29:22.457 --> 29:25.424
investigating the Cabrerra
family drug operation.

29:25.491 --> 29:28.890
I was spending
a lot of time in clubs.

29:28.957 --> 29:30.057
Spending a lot of time

29:30.124 --> 29:32.090
with a lot of
really twisted people,

29:32.157 --> 29:34.424
dabbling in the drugs myself,
which was really stupid,

29:34.491 --> 29:37.790
but kind of the only way
to live in that world.

29:37.857 --> 29:40.190
She was this club girl.

29:40.257 --> 29:42.324
Everywhere I was, she was.

29:42.391 --> 29:44.923
She was so much fun.

29:44.990 --> 29:46.790
And I'm this
pathological bachelor,

29:46.857 --> 29:49.457
but all of a sudden,
I can't bear the thought

29:49.524 --> 29:51.424
of living my life
without this girl.

29:51.491 --> 29:54.790
I can't bear the thought
of her being with anybody else.

29:56.658 --> 29:58.923
I fell hard, Allison.

30:03.324 --> 30:04.923
Then one day,
our favorite district attorney

30:04.990 --> 30:07.790
Manuel Devalos calls me
into his office.

30:07.857 --> 30:11.691
He says, "You engaged
to this woman?"

30:13.724 --> 30:16.691
And it's her.

30:16.758 --> 30:19.057
She's a Cabrerra.

30:19.124 --> 30:20.890
It's all a setup.

30:20.957 --> 30:24.057
I can't testify against them
without an attorney saying,

30:24.124 --> 30:27.857
"Hey, wait a second.
You're not an unbiased witness."

30:27.923 --> 30:30.124
So they drummed me out of Vice,

30:30.190 --> 30:32.724
put me through rehab,
moved me over to Homicide.

30:32.790 --> 30:34.224
I never saw her again.

30:34.291 --> 30:36.391
Not until the other day
when she showed up

30:36.457 --> 30:38.324
at that NA meeting.

30:40.391 --> 30:42.457
So...

30:42.524 --> 30:47.391
that's the wedding,
the drugs.

30:47.457 --> 30:49.090
What else did you dream?

30:49.157 --> 30:51.857
She blinds you.

30:51.923 --> 30:54.357
I guess we both know
what that's about.

30:56.391 --> 30:58.691
Larry said
this girl Jennifer

30:58.758 --> 31:03.624
was deep undercover
in Elena's organization.

31:03.691 --> 31:06.157
We're guessing Elena killed her,
then sought me out

31:06.224 --> 31:07.823
to be sure we bought
the mule thing.

31:07.890 --> 31:10.124
And we would have if it wasn't
for the plastic surgery.

31:10.190 --> 31:12.291
What happens now?

31:12.357 --> 31:14.324
We have a warrant out
for her arrest,

31:14.391 --> 31:16.057
but I'm guessing she's gone.

31:16.124 --> 31:18.457
What was that other dream?

31:18.524 --> 31:20.890
Devalos searches
your place.

31:20.957 --> 31:22.491
Right.

31:22.557 --> 31:25.491
Can't help you with that one.

31:35.257 --> 31:36.658
Hi, Mom.

31:36.724 --> 31:37.724
I'm hungry.

31:37.790 --> 31:39.424
Can we stop somewhere for food?

31:39.491 --> 31:40.890
We have food
at home, Bridge.

31:40.957 --> 31:42.923
We got apples,
oranges, bananas.

31:42.990 --> 31:44.524
That's not food.
It's fruit.

31:46.090 --> 31:48.457
Hi, Mom. Can I bring a friend
home from school?

31:48.524 --> 31:49.957
Now? Today?

31:50.024 --> 31:51.557
Oh, Ariel, who is it?

31:51.624 --> 31:53.391
Terrence Bock.

31:53.457 --> 31:56.624
Terrence Bock?

31:56.691 --> 31:58.024
Sure, I guess so.

31:59.357 --> 32:02.391
ARIEL:
Hey, Terrence, she
said it's all right!

32:11.124 --> 32:12.724
Hi, Terrence.
Nice to meet you.

32:12.790 --> 32:14.524
Hi.

32:14.591 --> 32:17.424
Are you hot with that coat on?

32:17.491 --> 32:19.224
No.

32:19.291 --> 32:21.257
This is my sister Bridgette.

32:21.324 --> 32:22.090
Hi.

32:24.090 --> 32:26.024
<i>( whispering ):
Tell her you want
to stop for food.</i>

32:26.090 --> 32:28.957
Thanks for being
so nice to him.

32:29.024 --> 32:31.957
Letting him stay
for dinner and everything.

32:32.024 --> 32:34.823
Oh, I was happy to.

32:34.890 --> 32:36.923
He seemed really...

32:38.291 --> 32:40.057
What is the deal
with that coat?

32:40.124 --> 32:41.823
I don't know.

32:41.890 --> 32:43.457
He's kind of odd.

32:43.524 --> 32:45.923
I'm not even sure we're
going to stay friends.

32:45.990 --> 32:49.557
Although, he did seem
to hit it off with Bridgette.

32:49.624 --> 32:51.724
But you
were right.

32:51.790 --> 32:55.591
I'm glad I told him how much
I liked his presentation.

32:55.658 --> 32:58.758
You can tell
he's probably not somebody

32:58.823 --> 33:01.257
who hears good stuff
very much.

33:01.324 --> 33:05.424
I think you probably made him
very happy.

33:05.491 --> 33:08.424
I talked to Mr. Cathcart, too.

33:08.491 --> 33:10.724
Oh, yeah?

33:10.790 --> 33:13.790
I told him I wouldn't be going
to the State Assembly.

33:13.857 --> 33:15.557
I hope that's okay.

33:15.624 --> 33:19.857
I think that's very okay.

33:19.923 --> 33:22.257
How did he react?

33:22.324 --> 33:25.890
He got really quiet.

33:25.957 --> 33:28.291
Both of him.

33:28.357 --> 33:31.157
We have really special kids.

33:31.224 --> 33:32.923
I had nothing to do with it.

33:32.990 --> 33:35.890
I wasn't even in town that week.

33:35.957 --> 33:39.124
Did you ask what gives
with that boy and his coat?

33:39.190 --> 33:41.057
Apparently, that's
where he derives

33:41.124 --> 33:43.324
his extraordinary powers
of elocution from.

33:45.324 --> 33:46.823
<i>( sighs )</i>

33:46.890 --> 33:48.658
Today started off
as the most dark, awful day.

33:52.124 --> 33:54.391
What happened
to change it?

33:54.457 --> 33:57.157
Nothing changed.

33:57.224 --> 34:00.890
The woman responsible
for all this death and sadness

34:00.957 --> 34:02.691
is still at large.

34:02.758 --> 34:06.057
Detective Scanlon
is out there somewhere

34:06.124 --> 34:07.691
wrestling with his demons,

34:07.758 --> 34:09.157
trying to make sense
of the choices

34:09.224 --> 34:11.623
he's made with his life.

34:11.690 --> 34:14.989
A young undercover cop
and two unsuspecting mules

34:15.056 --> 34:17.822
are still dead.

34:17.889 --> 34:21.324
Nothing changed.

34:21.391 --> 34:24.291
It's just...

34:24.357 --> 34:27.724
I have kids.

34:27.790 --> 34:31.757
No matter how dark
things get at work

34:31.822 --> 34:34.658
I can come home.

34:34.724 --> 34:37.724
And there's always
something light.

34:41.324 --> 34:43.591
All right, maybe I was
home those weeks.

34:55.056 --> 34:56.190
Forget the light.

34:56.257 --> 34:57.691
Close the door.

35:00.391 --> 35:03.790
Elena...
you already killed one cop.

35:03.857 --> 35:06.257
You shoot me, they won't
even bother with a trial.

35:06.324 --> 35:07.291
They'll just claim

35:07.357 --> 35:08.857
you tried to escape
one night

35:08.923 --> 35:10.691
and let one of the guards
take you out for fun.

35:10.758 --> 35:12.491
I didn't kill any cops.

35:12.557 --> 35:13.923
I didn't kill any mules.

35:13.990 --> 35:15.524
I didn't do this.

35:15.591 --> 35:17.923
It wasn't done by me.
It was done to me.

35:19.957 --> 35:21.157
Don't answer it.

35:23.890 --> 35:25.024
Elena...

35:31.391 --> 35:32.524
Yeah?

35:32.591 --> 35:33.724
DEVALOS:
Lee.

35:33.790 --> 35:36.424
It's Manny Devalos.

35:37.957 --> 35:39.491
Lee.

35:51.291 --> 35:53.857
Hey, what's
going on?

35:53.923 --> 35:55.758
Is everything okay?

35:55.823 --> 35:58.624
I don't know.
I think I have
to call Devalos.

35:58.691 --> 36:00.890
What?

36:00.957 --> 36:02.357
What are you
talking about?

36:02.424 --> 36:04.124
It's 3:00 in
the morning, Al.

36:06.923 --> 36:07.923
Almost out the door.

36:07.990 --> 36:09.057
Excuse me?

36:09.124 --> 36:10.324
I'm sorry. Who is this?

36:10.391 --> 36:12.758
It's Allison Dubois.
It's Allison.

36:12.823 --> 36:15.124
I'm sorry to call you
in the middle of the night.

36:15.190 --> 36:16.124
It's just...

36:16.190 --> 36:17.790
Allison, I can't talk now.

36:17.857 --> 36:19.957
Look, someone spotted a woman
who matches the description

36:20.024 --> 36:22.157
of Elena Cabrerra breaking
and entering an apartment

36:22.224 --> 36:24.257
in the building where
Detective Scanlon lives.

36:24.324 --> 36:25.758
We've been calling and calling,

36:25.823 --> 36:27.624
but we can't get him
on the phone.

36:27.691 --> 36:29.357
It's probably
a wild-goose chase,

36:29.424 --> 36:31.424
but I'm headed over there now
with Lieutenant Greene.

36:31.491 --> 36:33.357
Can I talk to you
tomorrow please?

36:33.424 --> 36:35.190
Of course, but...

36:35.257 --> 36:37.491
It's not
a wild-goose chase, sir.

36:38.200 --> 36:40.200
???

36:44.954 --> 36:46.120
Forget the light.

36:46.987 --> 36:48.388
Close the door.

36:51.121 --> 36:54.520
Elena...
you already killed one cop.

36:54.587 --> 36:56.987
You shoot me, they won't
even bother with a trial.

36:57.054 --> 36:57.987
They'll just claim

36:58.054 --> 36:59.553
you tried to escape
one night

36:59.620 --> 37:01.354
and let one of the guards
take you out for fun.

37:01.421 --> 37:03.187
I didn't kill any cops.

37:03.254 --> 37:04.620
I didn't kill any mules.

37:04.687 --> 37:06.187
I didn't do this.

37:06.254 --> 37:08.454
It wasn't done by me.
It was done to me.

37:08.520 --> 37:10.653
Elena...

37:10.720 --> 37:13.321
I need your help.

37:13.388 --> 37:14.854
I need your protection.

37:14.920 --> 37:15.887
What are you talking about?

37:15.954 --> 37:17.854
Of all the women
in the world,

37:17.920 --> 37:20.520
you're the one I know
needs the least protection.

37:20.587 --> 37:21.854
Now put the gun down.

37:21.920 --> 37:25.154
You're such an
adorable fool, Lee.

37:25.221 --> 37:27.421
Everybody needs protection.

37:27.488 --> 37:29.021
Especially drug dealers.

37:29.087 --> 37:31.321
Don't you know that's what
you were supposed to be?

37:31.388 --> 37:33.820
When I first met you
at the clubs,

37:33.887 --> 37:35.620
when I first made you
for a cop,

37:35.687 --> 37:38.620
I said to my uncles,
"That one. He's cute.

37:38.687 --> 37:41.121
He's on his way up.
Let me at him."

37:41.187 --> 37:43.653
And you were good
at everything.

37:43.720 --> 37:46.720
Except the compromising-
your-convictions part.

37:46.787 --> 37:48.321
No way were
you going to take

37:48.388 --> 37:49.488
a piece of our operation

37:49.553 --> 37:50.754
in return for
a little protection.

37:50.820 --> 37:51.820
It just wasn't
in you.

37:51.887 --> 37:53.354
Sorry to let you down.

37:53.421 --> 37:56.454
I had a need and
you couldn't fill it.

37:56.520 --> 37:58.054
But your friend,
Larry Greene...

37:58.121 --> 37:59.187
What'd you call him?

37:59.254 --> 38:01.287
"The best man I know?"

38:01.354 --> 38:02.754
Very practical fellow.

38:02.820 --> 38:05.587
Happy to hear that.

38:05.653 --> 38:08.321
Now here you want my help.

38:08.388 --> 38:09.954
Then put the gun down...

38:10.021 --> 38:12.920
and let me take you in.

38:13.720 --> 38:15.354
Anything you
want to say,

38:15.421 --> 38:18.887
I know the DA
would love to hear it.

38:18.954 --> 38:20.021
Lee...

38:20.087 --> 38:21.854
I'm trying to tell you
what's going on.

38:21.920 --> 38:24.287
I'm trying to tell you
what happened.

38:24.354 --> 38:26.187
That girl? That cop?

38:26.254 --> 38:29.421
She was deep undercover,
and she figured it out.

38:29.488 --> 38:31.154
She figured out
Lieutenant Greene
was dirty,

38:31.221 --> 38:32.321
so he killed her.

38:32.388 --> 38:33.520
Made her look like a mule,

38:33.587 --> 38:35.121
and figured I'd start
a war over it,

38:35.187 --> 38:36.454
and by the time
the smoke cleared,

38:36.520 --> 38:37.920
nobody'd be the wiser.

38:37.987 --> 38:41.388
Now, that's quite
a story, Elena.

38:41.454 --> 38:42.754
But you have to admit

38:42.820 --> 38:47.054
you been telling stories
since the day I met you.

38:47.121 --> 38:51.021
"I'm just a businesswoman
who loves to dance, Lee."

38:51.087 --> 38:55.021
"I've been waiting for you
my whole life, Lee."

38:55.087 --> 38:57.321
"I'd love
to marry you, Lee."

38:59.754 --> 39:02.187
Now put the gun down,
let me take you to city hall

39:02.254 --> 39:03.454
where you can tell your story

39:03.520 --> 39:05.620
to somebody who actually
gives a damn.

39:11.854 --> 39:13.321
Thank you.

39:16.388 --> 39:17.388
Turn around.

39:27.254 --> 39:28.520
<i>( knocking )</i>

39:30.321 --> 39:31.388
Yeah?

39:31.454 --> 39:33.454
Hey, Lee,
it's Greene.

39:33.520 --> 39:34.687
Word on
the street is

39:34.754 --> 39:35.520
you might have
some company.

39:35.587 --> 39:36.754
Got it under control.

39:36.820 --> 39:38.887
We're heading downtown,
you want to meet us.

39:38.954 --> 39:40.520
Whatever you say,
amigo.

39:40.587 --> 39:42.254
Just want to warn
you, though...

39:42.321 --> 39:44.121
the whole damn cavalry
is on the way.

39:44.187 --> 39:47.154
Do me a favor and tell them
to meet me back at the fort.

39:47.221 --> 39:49.287
You got it.

39:52.887 --> 39:53.887
Lee...

39:56.920 --> 39:58.354
You have the right
to remain silent.

39:58.421 --> 40:00.954
Anything you say
can and will be

40:01.021 --> 40:03.054
used against you
in a court of law.

40:03.121 --> 40:05.054
You have the right to counsel.

40:09.587 --> 40:11.154
Skank-whore death merchant.

40:11.221 --> 40:12.820
Kills a cop.
Breaks and enters.

40:12.887 --> 40:13.887
Over and out.

40:27.987 --> 40:28.987
Lee!

40:29.488 --> 40:30.388
Lee!

40:30.454 --> 40:32.454
Lee!

40:52.920 --> 40:56.121
Yeah...

40:56.187 --> 40:59.653
"That one," I said.

40:59.720 --> 41:04.154
"He's cute.

41:04.221 --> 41:05.920
Let me at him."

41:39.254 --> 41:39.354
How you doing?

41:40.321 --> 41:42.720
I was concerned
about you.

41:44.021 --> 41:45.820
Why, did you have
any more dreams?

41:45.887 --> 41:51.054
Well, yeah, actually,
I had one.

41:51.121 --> 41:54.121
A woman came to me.

41:54.187 --> 41:56.954
She was on her way to
a very dark, awful place,

41:57.021 --> 41:59.454
and she knew it.

41:59.520 --> 42:01.488
Before she got there,

42:01.553 --> 42:04.854
she wanted me
to say "hi" to you.

42:04.920 --> 42:07.488
To tell you
she was sorry.

42:07.553 --> 42:09.720
To tell you
"thank you."

42:21.254 --> 42:24.553
What, no
"Deputy Doll"?

42:24.620 --> 42:26.587
I don't know.

42:26.653 --> 42:29.021
I got the sense
it wasn't appreciated.

42:30.054 --> 42:31.388
Really?

42:31.454 --> 42:32.920
Not much of a mind reader,
are you?
