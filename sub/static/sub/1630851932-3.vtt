00:07.960 --> 00:10.520
- I know it's a lot to take in.
- She doesn't know she was here?

00:10.680 --> 00:11.720
Nobody else knows.

00:11.840 --> 00:13.480
Looks like I'm stuck down here
permanently.

00:13.600 --> 00:15.240
Start figuring out a way
to get your job back.

00:15.360 --> 00:17.480
Be inventive.
Get back in the loop.

00:18.640 --> 00:20.280
What about that drink?
You buying or what?

00:20.400 --> 00:22.200
Definitely. Stay here.

00:24.760 --> 00:26.640
It was X-331 all along.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.440
She thinks that
she cured herself.

00:28.600 --> 00:30.280
She's gonna get the recognition
for my treatment

00:30.400 --> 00:32.360
because you're afraid
of a difficult conversation.

00:32.480 --> 00:34.000
I got the call.
We've got a job.

00:34.600 --> 00:37.440
- I've never seen anything like this.
- You look worried.

00:37.600 --> 00:39.720
If you'd like to make the incision,
please, Mr. Glover Brown.

00:43.760 --> 00:46.280
You should let Dr. Sutton-Greville
take a look at you.

00:46.400 --> 00:48.280
I was told it was payment
on completion.

00:48.600 --> 00:51.480
My client expected the work
of a top heart surgeon.

00:51.600 --> 00:54.080
- Well, that is exactly what he got.
- No, he did not.

00:54.200 --> 00:55.360
We are fucked!

00:55.680 --> 00:57.200
I'm looking for Daniel Milton.

00:57.360 --> 01:00.200
You're telling me
I have your kidney inside me?

01:00.320 --> 01:01.680
We have an agreement.

01:01.920 --> 01:07.000
I want money.
The price of my kidney. Fifty thousand.

02:43.600 --> 02:47.680
TEMPLE

04:02.720 --> 04:04.360
Daniel, what's this?

04:05.520 --> 04:07.120
You remortgaged our house?

04:07.640 --> 04:10.040
- What?
- You remortgaged our home. Why?

04:10.640 --> 04:13.000
Obviously not
to pay for my kidney.

04:13.320 --> 04:16.160
Jesus. What the hell's going on, Daniel?
I mean, where's all our money gone?

04:16.280 --> 04:18.640
What have you spent it on?
How are we supposed to pay her back?

04:18.760 --> 04:22.320
She could be with the police right now,
telling them everything.

04:23.960 --> 04:25.400
Sorry.

04:26.720 --> 04:28.920
- Hello.
- I need to see you.

04:30.080 --> 04:33.960
- Why, you gonna pay me my money?
- 120 Chamberlain Road, Belgravia.

04:34.200 --> 04:35.280
Thirty minutes.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.520
- Be there.
- No. I can't just drop everything...

04:41.080 --> 04:42.560
Who's that?

04:43.120 --> 04:45.400
Work. I need to go in. They need me.

04:46.640 --> 04:49.280
I thought you said you were taking
the day off to sort this out.

04:49.400 --> 04:52.080
Yeah, but it's an emergency.
I have to go in.

04:52.240 --> 04:54.320
Well, I need you here, so...

05:02.960 --> 05:04.480
Hello.

05:12.360 --> 05:13.840
I'm the builder.

05:16.240 --> 05:18.040
It's about the wall.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.600
Daniel, he says
he's here about the wall.

05:23.920 --> 05:26.720
- The wall?
- Yeah, I'm the builder.

05:26.840 --> 05:29.720
You... You rang
a while back about...

05:29.880 --> 05:32.840
- About knocking through?
- Knocking through. Right.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.360
Sorry, what's this?

05:35.080 --> 05:38.400
It's about the roof terrace
you always wanted.

05:42.160 --> 05:44.120
Have we met?

05:45.200 --> 05:46.600
I don't think so.

05:47.960 --> 05:50.000
It's just you look familiar.

05:50.240 --> 05:53.960
- No... I've got one of those faces.
- Yes.

05:56.320 --> 05:57.480
What?

05:57.600 --> 06:01.360
Yes. I know what you mean.
He does look familiar.

06:01.480 --> 06:05.440
So I think maybe he does have
one of those faces

06:10.400 --> 06:12.000
Get rid of him.

06:18.320 --> 06:21.280
So weird seeing her do stuff
like a proper person.

06:21.680 --> 06:23.840
What do you mean?
She's a proper person.

06:23.960 --> 06:27.320
No, I know. I mean, just see her
walking and talking.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.720
- Why are you here?
- Look, mate, I haven't slept.

06:32.280 --> 06:35.880
What are we gonna do about Suzana?
Where are we gonna get the money?

06:36.080 --> 06:37.080
What if she does something else?

06:37.200 --> 06:39.320
If you're worried about her coming here
and telling Beth about the kidney,

06:39.480 --> 06:40.840
you're too late,
she did that yesterday.

06:40.960 --> 06:43.320
- What? Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

06:43.840 --> 06:45.840
- She means business.
- No shit.

06:46.200 --> 06:47.720
So what're we gonna do?

06:49.080 --> 06:51.440
Well, we're gonna have
to get rid of her.

06:53.240 --> 06:55.520
What? You mean...

06:57.160 --> 07:00.440
No, no, no! Don't be ridiculous. I mean,
to get the money and pay her off.

07:00.560 --> 07:02.400
- All right. But how?
- Daniel?

07:03.360 --> 07:05.160
I don't want a roof terrace.

07:05.400 --> 07:06.960
No, he says he's got his diar in the van,

07:07.120 --> 07:09.000
so maybe we should go through
some dates.

07:09.120 --> 07:12.640
- I thought you had to go to work.
- It won't hurt to get a price.

07:12.920 --> 07:14.200
I won't be long.

07:25.200 --> 07:28.440
- I need a lift to Belgravia.
- What's in Belgravia?

07:29.040 --> 07:30.320
Gubby.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.360
Daniel?

07:39.960 --> 07:41.560
Daniel!

07:51.680 --> 07:54.400
Who parks like that? Fuck!

07:57.320 --> 07:59.720
Shit.
Hello, Sarge.

08:00.320 --> 08:02.280
Yeah. Sorry, I'm running late.

08:02.760 --> 08:04.560
Yeah, my boiler blew up.

08:05.120 --> 08:07.840
Yeah, sorry.
I'll be on my desk within the hour.

08:24.360 --> 08:26.240
You sure you don't want me
to hang around?

08:26.360 --> 08:27.720
No.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.640
- What for?
- Well, just in case.

08:34.360 --> 08:36.040
In case of what?

08:44.280 --> 08:46.600
- Probably Beth again.
- It's Anna.

08:49.920 --> 08:51.680
Anna, look, I can't really talk
right now.

08:51.800 --> 08:54.520
Can you meet me at 3 o'clock
this afternoon? It's really important.

08:54.720 --> 08:55.720
Are you all right?

08:55.840 --> 08:58.240
Yeah, I'm good. I just need you
to be there at 3 o'clock. Okay?

08:58.360 --> 09:01.400
- I'll send you a pin.
- Yeah, look, I don't know if...

09:31.400 --> 09:33.240
Do you have my money?

09:34.400 --> 09:35.760
Then why am I here?

09:36.240 --> 09:39.520
You've been requested.
Your patient from yesterday.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.120
At the embassy?

09:43.240 --> 09:47.400
-  Why, was there a complication?
-  Well, let's hope not, for your sake.

09:48.360 --> 09:49.720
You didn't...

09:50.360 --> 09:52.560
Did.. Is he alive?

09:53.720 --> 09:55.040
I don't know.

09:56.160 --> 09:58.840
Once we walk in there,
we're on foreign soil.

09:59.520 --> 10:01.240
Different rules apply.

10:51.320 --> 10:53.160
- Hi.
- What the...

10:57.720 --> 10:59.200
What you doing here?

10:59.480 --> 11:01.960
Don't worry, nobody saw me.
I was very careful.

11:02.280 --> 11:05.680
-  Your dad's not here.
-  I know. It's not him I came to see.

11:10.680 --> 11:15.920
Only now can the bears head out
onto the sea ice to hunt for seals.

11:17.240 --> 11:20.720
But the new ice
has a surprise in store.

11:30.240 --> 11:33.600
This season,
for the first time ever recorded,

11:34.120 --> 11:36.400
even the winter ice is thinner.

11:41.760 --> 11:47.680
The ice here is too thin to climb out
of, and he struggles to free himself.

12:01.440 --> 12:03.840
His fate looks uncertain,

12:04.680 --> 12:09.480
as his chances of survival
slip further from his control.

12:18.840 --> 12:20.520
Follow me, please.

12:24.520 --> 12:26.240
Thank you.

12:53.200 --> 12:56.160
Doctor... you're here.

12:57.920 --> 12:59.960
Tommy has an old injury.

13:00.920 --> 13:02.440
Your assistant?

13:02.800 --> 13:05.240
He said you would help me.
Is he here?

13:06.600 --> 13:09.000
No. He...
He has another surgery.

13:10.280 --> 13:11.840
What's the injury?

13:13.520 --> 13:17.160
A bullet lodged in between
my lower right ribs.

13:18.640 --> 13:20.280
Well, I'm a heart surgeon.

13:20.600 --> 13:24.000
Please. It has taken a long time
to get our friend to see a doctor.

13:24.560 --> 13:27.840
Of course, the doctor will help.
Won't you?

13:28.840 --> 13:30.840
Yes, of course.

13:31.400 --> 13:32.760
Wonderful.

13:32.920 --> 13:35.960
I will leave you to it. I believe
you have everything you need.

13:36.280 --> 13:38.960
Well, no.
I'm gonna need an anesthetist.

13:39.280 --> 13:40.560
No.

13:41.120 --> 13:44.280
- I'm not going to sleep.
- He prefers local anesthetic.

13:44.400 --> 13:45.760
No, no needles.

13:49.240 --> 13:52.280
Tommy, I... I need to explain.

13:52.880 --> 13:54.840
I'll have to administer
at least a local...

13:54.960 --> 13:56.520
I said no.

13:59.560 --> 14:00.960
Don't worry.

14:01.520 --> 14:03.720
I have a strong pain threshold.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.200
Right.

14:20.440 --> 14:22.680
This is fucking insane.
I can't do this.

14:22.800 --> 14:26.960
Okay? I'm serious. This is complete...
This is dangerous.

14:27.080 --> 14:29.880
Fear is the enemy of growth.

14:33.360 --> 14:34.480
Go on.

14:35.080 --> 14:37.600
My dad told me you found this place
through your old job.

14:37.720 --> 14:39.840
- Oh, did he?
- Yeah.

14:41.920 --> 14:43.800
Why was he talking about
my job?

14:44.440 --> 14:48.280
I know it's all top secret.
Don't worry, I'm not gonna tell anyone.

14:49.240 --> 14:52.120
I think it's amazing, Lee,
what you've done here.

14:52.560 --> 14:53.760
Thank you.

14:53.880 --> 14:56.160
Like the way you've just broken
away from the norm,

14:56.280 --> 14:59.720
and you've built a whole life down here.
It's really impressive.

15:00.280 --> 15:02.240
Yeah, well, you know, it's...

15:04.600 --> 15:05.600
Thanks.

15:05.720 --> 15:07.160
Most people,
they just trudge along

15:07.280 --> 15:09.800
without any independent thought
whatsoever. Right?

15:10.520 --> 15:13.200
It's all about self-education,
self-responsibility.

15:13.320 --> 15:14.520
Yeah, exactly.

15:19.480 --> 15:22.320
So your dad tells me
you're big into activism.

15:22.480 --> 15:24.560
- Environmental stuff.
- Yeah, yeah.

15:25.400 --> 15:28.760
I've been banging on
about climate change for years.

15:28.880 --> 15:30.720
You should come and join us.

15:31.400 --> 15:34.400
- Me?
- Definitely.

15:34.480 --> 15:37.640
-  No, I don't...
- Come on, we need people like you, Lee.

15:40.720 --> 15:43.360
Why were you asking your dad
about my old job?

15:43.480 --> 15:45.640
- To protect you.
- What?

15:45.800 --> 15:48.520
I want that job.
I'm meeting Jeremy today.

15:48.840 --> 15:51.600
You? You're meeting Jeremy?

15:51.720 --> 15:54.040
Have you thought about what would
happen if someone found this place?

15:54.160 --> 15:57.040
Well, they won't. Look,
I've blocked everywhere off.

15:57.800 --> 15:59.800
Okay, but someone still could.

16:00.760 --> 16:03.880
My dad could be arrested
for treating people illegally,

16:04.160 --> 16:07.080
for treating my dead mum illegally.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.400
But if I get that job,
then I can protect them.

16:11.560 --> 16:14.440
I could protect you.
I could protect this place.

16:17.720 --> 16:19.680
So will you help me?

16:29.680 --> 16:33.160
Daniel, I'm in the hospital.
Call me back right now.

16:35.960 --> 16:38.080
We need to take
some deep breaths.

16:40.920 --> 16:45.120
Really big, deep breaths right down
into the bottom of your lungs.

16:55.640 --> 16:56.880
You ready?

17:15.760 --> 17:17.760
- Come in.
- Hi, Ed.

17:20.800 --> 17:21.800
Beth?

17:21.920 --> 17:24.840
Yes, me alive. Sorry.
Did Daniel not say?

17:25.840 --> 17:27.640
No. He...

17:27.760 --> 17:30.120
Yeah, look, where is he?
I need to see him.

17:32.080 --> 17:33.280
He's...

17:33.760 --> 17:36.560
Is he in theater?
There was an emergency.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.760
Could you just find out which one?

17:41.240 --> 17:44.840
- God, this is...
- Yes, I know. It's very weird.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.320
A shock. I'm sorry.
I'm not sorry I'm alive.

17:47.440 --> 17:49.720
I'm sorry I keep frightening
people to death.

17:49.840 --> 17:51.960
Could you just page him for me?

17:53.120 --> 17:55.440
He's not here in the hospital.

17:56.760 --> 17:58.640
- What?
- He's not working today.

17:59.520 --> 18:03.600
- Well, he is. He had a call.
- He's been suspended from duties.

18:04.480 --> 18:06.960
He's not allowed
to carry out surgeries.

18:13.520 --> 18:14.640
Not long now.

18:16.160 --> 18:17.560
Hang in there.

18:19.560 --> 18:21.240
- Want me to stop?
- No, no, no, no.

18:21.360 --> 18:22.840
Get it out!

18:41.560 --> 18:44.720
You're doing really well, Tommy.
Not long now.

18:46.520 --> 18:48.880
Would you come and hold these, please?

18:50.040 --> 18:53.600
Just hold on to that. Hold them still.
That's it. Thank you.

18:56.560 --> 18:57.760
He's fainted.

18:58.600 --> 19:01.600
That's good. We can keep going
without him moving.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.840
Hold these.

19:16.520 --> 19:18.080
Why've you stopped?

19:19.080 --> 19:20.880
Because I can't continue.

19:21.800 --> 19:23.440
Let me rephrase that.

19:24.160 --> 19:27.600
I refused to continue until you
pay me the £50,000 you owe me.

19:28.080 --> 19:31.040
- Remove the bullet now.
- No.

19:32.200 --> 19:35.520
You transfer the money
into my account now.

19:35.640 --> 19:37.880
Finish this.
We can discuss it later.

19:38.200 --> 19:40.360
Look, you've got my details.

19:40.840 --> 19:42.360
- Transfer the money.
- If he dies...

19:42.480 --> 19:45.000
If he dies, you need to think
about your son.

19:48.600 --> 19:51.960
Because I am fully prepared
to let this man bleed out.

19:56.920 --> 19:58.400
You have your phone?

20:00.320 --> 20:01.800
Yeah.

20:27.160 --> 20:28.400
Done.

20:29.280 --> 20:30.880
Good.

20:48.320 --> 20:50.400
That's the bullet out, Tommy.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.360
Well done.

20:58.680 --> 21:00.080
What?

21:02.760 --> 21:05.920
I don't think the bullet was
the cause of this man's pain.

21:07.160 --> 21:09.080
His liver
is in serious trouble.

21:09.840 --> 21:11.360
Close him up.

21:14.160 --> 21:16.880
- I'll just take a biopsy.
- You've done your job.

21:18.280 --> 21:19.920
Close him up.

21:25.120 --> 21:29.240
You've reached Daniel Milton.
Please leave a message after the tone.

21:42.760 --> 21:45.160
Eve Milton.

21:47.320 --> 21:49.560
I really appreciate you seeing me,
Mr. Hooper.

21:49.680 --> 21:51.760
- Come in, take a seat.
- Thank you.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.200
So, I must say,
I was quite surprised,

21:57.320 --> 22:01.200
your interest in the position, considering
your past employment and studies...

22:01.920 --> 22:04.840
waitressing, retail and art gallery.

22:04.960 --> 22:07.080
I think it's really
important to diversify.

22:07.200 --> 22:09.640
Having many strings
to my bow as possible.

22:09.800 --> 22:11.000
Very sensible.

22:11.120 --> 22:14.200
However, we are looking for particular
skills and experience for the role.

22:14.360 --> 22:17.840
Yeah, you'd be surprised
at how many skills are transferable.

22:18.440 --> 22:22.960
I'm sure. It does take quite
specific expertise, though.

22:23.240 --> 22:24.880
I'm a very adept learner.

22:26.600 --> 22:28.480
Do you know anything
about what we do here?

22:28.680 --> 22:32.160
I imagine from the job description
that the role requires a firm handle

22:32.280 --> 22:35.000
on the different types of drainage
systems used in the city.

22:35.440 --> 22:36.440
How so?

22:36.560 --> 22:39.000
Just understanding the concept
of main drains,

22:39.160 --> 22:42.680
the difference between the systems
used for foul water and surface water...

22:43.200 --> 22:44.480
Yes.

22:44.640 --> 22:48.040
No one likes planning a project
without the basics in place first, right?

22:48.600 --> 22:50.560
You'd be surprised at how often
that happens.

22:50.680 --> 22:53.200
And that's what I meant
about transferrable skills.

22:53.640 --> 22:56.880
Whatever it is you create,
it requires rational, intelligent planning

22:57.040 --> 23:00.800
with well-thought-through strategy.
And that takes teamwork.

23:01.160 --> 23:02.680
Teamwork is very important.

23:02.920 --> 23:05.760
The most important aspect
of any role, I think.

23:13.880 --> 23:16.400
- What're you wearing?
- My interview outfit.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.000
Oh, my God, the interview.
How did it go?

23:18.120 --> 23:19.600
Start straightaway.

23:19.800 --> 23:20.960
- You got it?
- Yep.

23:21.080 --> 23:23.520
Full access to tunnels
on the Temple.

23:23.760 --> 23:26.800
How did you get it? I mean,
didn't the man ask you questions?

23:26.920 --> 23:29.040
Yeah, he did.
And I answered him.

23:30.040 --> 23:31.560
I don't wanna
blow my own trumpet, Ash,

23:31.720 --> 23:33.840
but I did partially complete
an English Lit degree.

23:33.960 --> 23:35.840
- Yeah.
- I'm pretty employable.

23:36.280 --> 23:38.640
I mean, I'm impressed.

23:39.560 --> 23:40.920
So, what you gonna do?

23:42.320 --> 23:45.680
- We're gonna shut the tube down.
- Fucking hell, Eve.

23:56.120 --> 23:58.840
Yeah, disrupt the city
from underneath the city.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.040
That could work.
It's going to be amazing, right?

24:03.480 --> 24:06.600
- Mum? What're you doing here?
- I need to speak to you.

24:08.800 --> 24:10.160
I'll call you later?

24:10.640 --> 24:12.360
- Yeah, no, it's fine.
- Sorry.

24:12.480 --> 24:14.600
It's cool.
I'll talk to you later.

24:15.240 --> 24:17.960
- How did you find me?
- Your phone.

24:18.360 --> 24:20.640
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.
I was desperate.

24:20.760 --> 24:21.880
It's okay.

24:22.240 --> 24:24.200
Did you know Dad's been
suspended from work?

24:24.320 --> 24:26.520
- No.
- Yeah, well, he has.

24:27.360 --> 24:30.360
He said he had an emergency
this morning, and I went...

24:30.480 --> 24:33.080
I went in and I followed him
and he wasn't there.

24:33.200 --> 24:36.880
- So, he's lying to me again.
- Again? What do you mean, again?

24:37.360 --> 24:41.040
I don't know. I just... Every time
I try and talk to him, he's so...

24:41.960 --> 24:45.800
- It's just... Sorry. I wouldn't...
-No, it's fine.

24:46.160 --> 24:48.760
It's just, I don't know
who else to talk to...

24:50.760 --> 24:54.680
I'm just so confused. I don't believe
a word he's saying anymore to me.

24:55.040 --> 24:58.360
None of it makes any sense, and I...
I'm just...

25:00.360 --> 25:04.160
I'm just so... I'm just tired.
I'm just really tired. And I can't...

25:05.200 --> 25:08.240
I don't know what to think.
I keep seeing things.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.240
What things?

25:11.520 --> 25:13.000
I don't know. Just...

25:13.840 --> 25:18.080
Just waking up, but not in that apartment.
Somewhere else.

25:18.240 --> 25:20.720
Somewhere dark,
somewhere underground.

25:23.920 --> 25:25.640
Can I show you something?

25:27.360 --> 25:28.840
Yeah. What?

25:33.240 --> 25:34.800
I should have told him
about his liver.

25:34.920 --> 25:36.520
People pay for good news.

25:37.280 --> 25:38.920
Compared to finding out too late,
it would be good news.

25:39.040 --> 25:40.760
It's over. Move on.

25:44.040 --> 25:45.720
I assume we won't be
meeting again.

25:46.080 --> 25:47.920
Now, why would
you assume that?

25:48.160 --> 25:49.880
I don't know. I mean...

25:50.000 --> 25:51.560
You impressed me.

25:52.640 --> 25:53.880
Thank you.

25:54.680 --> 25:56.840
Although it was a relatively
straightforward procedure...

25:57.000 --> 25:58.480
Not the procedure.

25:58.680 --> 26:01.680
To get what you wanted,
you'd have let him die.

26:04.280 --> 26:06.160
That's good to know.

26:24.280 --> 26:28.760
This is the name of a
specialist here in London.

26:30.880 --> 26:32.800
If you could give that to Tommy.

26:33.040 --> 26:35.200
Tell him I referred him and
tell him to go straightaway.

26:35.320 --> 26:37.080
Would you like to speak
to him yourself?

26:37.280 --> 26:39.760
No, just as long
as you give him that note.

26:39.960 --> 26:41.400
I'll give it to him straightaway.

26:41.560 --> 26:44.480
- Thank you.
- No, thank you, Doctor.

26:51.920 --> 26:53.240
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:58.880 --> 27:00.080
Any progress?

27:00.200 --> 27:03.080
- Yeah, actually.
- Cracked it, have you?

27:03.280 --> 27:06.200
Yeah, I think I might have.
Almost.

27:06.840 --> 27:10.480
I went to see Jamie, like you said,
and he led me to this other suspect.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.800
A Dutch woman
by the name of Anna.

27:13.080 --> 27:15.640
- Yeah?
- Yeah, actually.

27:16.600 --> 27:17.800
-What?
-You know.

27:18.520 --> 27:20.840
No, I don't know. What?

27:21.720 --> 27:22.720
She liked me.

27:22.840 --> 27:24.600
What, as in she is physically
attracted to you?

27:24.720 --> 27:27.280
Yeah. That's not hard to believe.

27:28.560 --> 27:32.200
- Why are you telling me this?
- I've managed to get close to her.

27:32.440 --> 27:35.240
- Wait, you didn't...
- I followed the lead to its logical end.

27:35.560 --> 27:39.640
And I discovered that she has
an ex-boyfriend who's a surgeon.

27:40.160 --> 27:42.040
Daniel Milton. This guy.

27:42.640 --> 27:45.040
He's married to this woman,
Beth Milton.

27:45.360 --> 27:48.560
Only he's not, 'cause she's dead.
Only she's not dead.

27:49.120 --> 27:51.680
'Cause I saw her this morning
with my own eyes.

27:53.880 --> 27:55.160
You have been busy.

27:55.360 --> 27:59.760
This surgeon could be the link to an
undetected network of serious criminals.

28:00.240 --> 28:02.000
I just don't know how.

28:03.040 --> 28:05.040
Think I should take these upstairs?

28:05.160 --> 28:07.400
What, and let someone else
take the credit?

28:07.520 --> 28:08.640
No.

28:09.320 --> 28:11.320
I think we keep this in the family.

28:18.480 --> 28:22.680
- I didn't think you'd make it.
- Neither did I.

28:23.480 --> 28:25.120
What's in the bag?

28:32.680 --> 28:34.320
Money for Suzana.

28:35.720 --> 28:37.720
I'm gonna give it to her tonight.

28:38.080 --> 28:40.800
Then I can get my life back
in some kind of order.

28:40.960 --> 28:42.960
Okay, I need to tell you
something.

28:43.400 --> 28:44.400
Okay.

28:44.520 --> 28:47.000
As you know,
I'd like to start to work again.

28:47.120 --> 28:49.440
- Yeah.
- On the Lancaster treatments.

28:49.800 --> 28:50.800
Yeah.

28:50.920 --> 28:54.520
But since I'm unable to tell anyone
about Beth, that's impossible.

28:54.680 --> 28:57.080
- I'm gonna tell her, I promise.
- So I found a new Beth.

28:57.920 --> 28:58.920
What?

28:59.040 --> 29:01.600
And she's gonna
bring more people like her.

29:02.560 --> 29:06.640
- What do you mean?
- To do the trial on. She's on her way.

29:06.800 --> 29:08.440
- She's coming here?
- Yeah.

29:08.560 --> 29:09.760
Now?

29:11.440 --> 29:14.000
So... And I've told her
that I've got Lancaster's

29:14.160 --> 29:16.120
and that you're gonna
cure us both.

29:17.240 --> 29:18.440
That's insane.

29:18.600 --> 29:21.280
Well, it's my turn to get something out
of this fucking mess.

29:21.400 --> 29:24.960
- Where are you even gonna do a trial?
- We're gonna do it in the bunker.

29:25.120 --> 29:26.840
Well, Lee's not gonna
let you use the bunker.

29:26.960 --> 29:29.160
He's already agreed to.
He's happy to help.

29:29.280 --> 29:30.640
He's happy?

29:31.720 --> 29:33.400
Really? He said that?

29:33.920 --> 29:37.480
Why? You think we cease to exist
when you're not in the room?

29:38.000 --> 29:39.520
No.

30:21.840 --> 30:23.200
I was here.

30:24.400 --> 30:25.920
I remember.

30:41.800 --> 30:44.480
So, this is my doctor friend
who I was telling you about.

30:44.600 --> 30:48.000
And this is Rebecca,
who I found on the Lancaster's forum.

30:48.320 --> 30:53.040
So what is all this? An effort to convince
me not all doctors are self-serving cocks?

30:53.840 --> 30:58.200
Well, Dr. Sutton-Greville
has been quite a big name in the...

30:59.440 --> 31:04.360
I've seen every doctor in London treating
Lancaster's, and I've never heard of you.

31:04.480 --> 31:08.360
Well, that's because he's been
working a lot overseas.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.400
He's been working abroad.

31:10.520 --> 31:14.280
But he's really ready to
trial treatments, aren't you?

31:15.280 --> 31:19.080
- Yes, to progress to the next stage.
- Which is what?

31:20.080 --> 31:21.920
How to get going on humans.

31:23.520 --> 31:25.080
You're full of shit.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.320
I beg your pardon?

31:27.480 --> 31:29.240
You're not a real doctor.

31:29.440 --> 31:31.920
- I can assure you, I am a real doctor.
- He is. He really is.

31:32.040 --> 31:34.560
"Get going on humans."
Who talks like that?

31:34.680 --> 31:37.400
And to be honest, Anna,
if that's your real name.

31:37.960 --> 31:40.320
- Yeah, it is.
- You've not got Lancaster's.

31:40.560 --> 31:44.200
You're a great actress
and all that, but I'm on it.

31:44.520 --> 31:47.640
- Well, honestly, Rebecca...
- Anna, don't.

31:48.480 --> 31:50.040
It's okay.

31:51.480 --> 31:53.000
Tell her the truth.

31:54.760 --> 31:57.400
She was diagnosed with
Lancaster's eight months ago.

31:57.520 --> 31:58.800
She kept it a secret
from us all

31:58.920 --> 32:01.760
while she worked on a cure
for herself at Faxhall.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.440
- You work at Faxhall?
- Yes, I did.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.200
Until she collapsed, and then...

32:10.560 --> 32:13.520
well, it wasn't a secret anymore.

32:15.360 --> 32:18.600
So, are you two together?

32:19.080 --> 32:20.440
- Yeah.
- No.

32:21.840 --> 32:23.120
Well, we...

32:23.680 --> 32:26.480
We're working on it,
it's been a tough time.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.120
- How often are you testing?
-Weekly.

32:33.800 --> 32:35.000
No symptoms?

32:35.400 --> 32:36.880
- None?
-N o.

32:39.080 --> 32:40.960
This is all very fucking creepy.

32:41.120 --> 32:42.760
We need people like you

32:42.880 --> 32:45.640
that wants agency
over their own treatments.

32:48.240 --> 32:50.880
- Is it safe?
- 100%.

32:51.120 --> 32:52.760
Nothing is 100% safe.

32:53.560 --> 32:57.360
- No, of course. But...
- It's 99.9% safe.

32:58.680 --> 33:00.240
Are you interested?

33:01.680 --> 33:03.600
Have you got your own clinic?

33:04.320 --> 33:06.880
- Of sorts, yes.
- What does that mean?

33:07.640 --> 33:10.120
It's not some backstreet
shithole, is it?

33:12.240 --> 33:14.800
You'll just need to make sure
you blindfold them on the way in.

33:14.960 --> 33:17.880
Sure. But... you really think
she's gonna do it?

33:18.320 --> 33:20.080
I really think
she's gonna do it.

33:20.200 --> 33:22.880
I never realized how much
I wanted it until now.

33:23.000 --> 33:26.040
- I can finally prove my work.
- Well, you deserve it.

33:26.720 --> 33:28.120
Lee!

33:29.400 --> 33:30.840
Lee?

33:41.120 --> 33:42.520
Beth...

33:44.720 --> 33:46.680
What's she doing here?

33:49.520 --> 33:50.600
I can explain.

33:50.720 --> 33:53.240
Explain what?
You said you told me everything.

33:53.560 --> 33:57.040
I was trying to protect you.
Both of you.

33:57.240 --> 33:58.600
From what?

33:59.640 --> 34:01.600
- Beth?
- Don't.

34:03.880 --> 34:05.440
You were part of this.

34:06.040 --> 34:09.120
- I just ended up here.
- I needed her help.

34:09.320 --> 34:12.200
Well, he knocked you out and dragged
you down here, kicking and screaming?

34:12.320 --> 34:14.160
Yeah, something like that. Yes.

34:14.440 --> 34:16.560
Did you help steal
that woman's kidney?

34:16.840 --> 34:18.200
- What?
- Is that what you do down here?

34:18.360 --> 34:19.360
What kidney?

34:19.480 --> 34:21.040
I didn't have anything
to do with the kidney.

34:21.160 --> 34:23.400
- She didn't.
- You stole someone's kidney?

34:24.360 --> 34:26.200
Yes, but to give to Mum.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.320
Why are you together now?

34:29.520 --> 34:31.240
Well, we...

34:32.480 --> 34:33.960
We've come...

34:34.160 --> 34:36.840
- Daniel?
- Answer her, Dad!

34:44.920 --> 34:47.280
Actually, can you just go, please?

34:49.920 --> 34:53.280
Leave, I think, is what she's saying.
Now!

35:01.680 --> 35:03.120
And you, darling.

35:04.320 --> 35:07.720
- What? No, I'm not leaving you.
- Go and wait for me outside.

35:08.480 --> 35:10.160
This won't take long.

35:16.400 --> 35:17.840
- Hey.
- Don't touch me.

35:17.960 --> 35:21.160
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
- I'll never trust you again.

35:26.680 --> 35:28.720
- Beth...
- This marriage is done.

35:29.360 --> 35:32.520
- What?
- I said I'm done with this marriage.

35:33.800 --> 35:37.440
- No, listen, you're in shock.
- Jesus, don't tell me what I'm feeling.

35:37.640 --> 35:39.440
Look, I needed to deal
with a couple of things.

35:39.600 --> 35:41.880
Now I have. We can go back
to living our lives.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.400
That woman is dying.

35:43.600 --> 35:46.080
Look, it's exactly
what I'm trying to deal with.

35:46.200 --> 35:47.840
I remember being here.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.400
I know what you did.

35:51.200 --> 35:53.200
Did you steal their organs, too?

35:54.040 --> 35:55.160
Who?

35:55.320 --> 35:58.040
Jesus, you know who.
I saw them here.

35:58.760 --> 36:02.560
- I saw you there.
- Beth, you have got this seriously wrong.

36:03.600 --> 36:05.000
I don't want this.

36:05.840 --> 36:07.360
Do you think I do?

36:07.920 --> 36:10.240
All of want is you and Eve
and our lives back.

36:10.360 --> 36:11.840
No, I mean this.

36:12.800 --> 36:14.000
This.

36:15.600 --> 36:16.720
Us.

36:17.680 --> 36:19.000
You.

36:20.360 --> 36:22.720
- What?
- I don't want our lives back.

36:24.760 --> 36:26.000
What do you mean?

36:26.160 --> 36:28.320
It's not just because of
the lies and the kidneys

36:28.440 --> 36:31.920
and whatever else went on down here.
But because I just don't.

36:32.360 --> 36:33.640
It's over.

36:35.600 --> 36:37.840
- Oh, come on, Beth.
- No, I'm serious.

36:39.520 --> 36:41.240
How can it be over?

36:41.800 --> 36:43.480
It was over a long time ago.

36:44.960 --> 36:48.440
Before I collapsed,
you were in your world and I was in mine.

36:48.720 --> 36:50.960
But that was because of the Lancaster's.

36:51.120 --> 36:52.960
You were protecting me.
You said so yourself.

36:53.080 --> 36:55.720
Yeah, but who does that,
though? Who... Who...

36:56.960 --> 37:01.160
Who keeps a secret like that from their
husband? Have you thought about that?

37:02.440 --> 37:03.440
No.

37:03.560 --> 37:05.880
No, have you thought
about any of this properly?

37:06.000 --> 37:08.320
- Of course.
- No, you haven't, Daniel.

37:09.840 --> 37:11.560
We're too old to pretend.

37:13.640 --> 37:17.480
- I haven't been pretending. Have you?
- Yeah. Yeah, I have.

37:17.720 --> 37:19.920
Not consciously,
but, yeah, on some level, I have.

37:20.040 --> 37:23.680
- No, you're confused. This is all...
- I've never been clearer.

37:25.440 --> 37:26.720
Beth.

37:27.600 --> 37:29.080
It's over.

37:31.840 --> 37:34.120
This is... us.

37:35.440 --> 37:37.880
This is you and me.
You and me and Eve.

37:40.240 --> 37:41.800
I need to look after Eve.

37:43.360 --> 37:46.120
- Beth.
- Yeah, make sure you look after Suzana.

38:14.440 --> 38:16.560
I'm guessing that's not good.

38:17.840 --> 38:18.920
No.

38:19.880 --> 38:22.200
Did you get the money for Suzana?

39:44.320 --> 39:46.880
I called her ahead.
She knows we're coming.

39:52.520 --> 39:53.960
Hello?

39:54.480 --> 39:56.160
TV is still on.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.440
Oh, shit.

40:00.920 --> 40:02.200
- What?
- Daniel!

40:02.600 --> 40:03.880
- What?
- Look!

40:07.760 --> 40:11.000
Oh, God.
We need to get in there.

40:24.280 --> 40:26.080
What do you wanna do?

40:33.280 --> 40:36.440
- What are you doing?
- Smash the window so we can get in.

40:36.880 --> 40:38.800
Give it here.

40:40.120 --> 40:41.880
Hope you've smashed more
windows in your time, Lee?

40:42.040 --> 40:43.280
More than you.

40:53.280 --> 40:54.760
Go on. You're all right.

41:51.560 --> 41:52.960
Phone.

41:53.680 --> 41:54.960
What?

41:55.640 --> 41:57.160
I need her phone.

42:00.320 --> 42:02.040
There.

42:05.040 --> 42:08.400
- What're you doing?
- Deleting my contact.

42:11.520 --> 42:12.920
Call register.

42:14.440 --> 42:16.240
I need to do that, too.

42:21.440 --> 42:24.280
- Wipe the phone.
- I've wiped the phone.

42:24.560 --> 42:27.040
No, the screen, for prints.

42:38.720 --> 42:40.320
Someone's coming.

42:41.880 --> 42:43.440
Let's go.

42:47.120 --> 42:49.120
Bag. Get the bag.
