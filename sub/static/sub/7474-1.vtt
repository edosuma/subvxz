00:48.740 --> 00:51.020
Greece and the islands
of the Aegean Sea...

00:51.260 --> 00:55.580
...have given birth to many myths
and legends of war and adventure.

00:57.460 --> 01:01.820
And these once-proud stones,
these ruined and shattered temples...

01:02.060 --> 01:06.780
...bear witness to the civilization
that flourished and then died here.

01:08.980 --> 01:12.380
And of the demigods and heroes
who inspired those legends...

01:12.620 --> 01:14.820
...on this sea and these islands.

01:15.060 --> 01:19.180
But though the stage is the same,
ours is a legend of our own times...

01:19.420 --> 01:23.380
...and its heroes are not demigods,
but ordinary people.

01:23.820 --> 01:26.580
In 1943, so the story goes...

01:26.820 --> 01:30.420
...2, 000 British soldiers lay
marooned on the island of Kheros...

01:30.660 --> 01:32.860
...exhausted and helpless.

01:33.540 --> 01:35.700
They had exactly one week to live.

01:35.940 --> 01:40.420
In Berlin, the Axis had determined on
a show of strength in the Aegean Sea...

01:40.660 --> 01:44.580
...to bully neutral Turkey into
coming into the war on their side.

01:47.140 --> 01:49.780
The scene of that demonstration
was to be Kheros...

01:50.020 --> 01:54.780
...itself of no military value,
but only miles off the coast of Turkey.

01:55.860 --> 01:58.620
The cream of the German
war machine, rested and ready...

01:58.860 --> 02:00.940
...was to spearhead the attack.

02:01.860 --> 02:03.420
The men on Kheros
were doomed...

02:03.660 --> 02:06.740
...unless they could be
evacuated before the blitz.

02:06.940 --> 02:09.300
But the only passage
to and from Kheros...

02:09.539 --> 02:11.620
...was guarded and blocked
by two great...

02:11.860 --> 02:14.580
...newly designed,
radar-controlled guns...

02:14.780 --> 02:16.660
...on the nearby island of Navarone.

02:20.660 --> 02:22.380
Guns too powerful and accurate...

02:22.580 --> 02:25.780
...for any Allied ship then
in the Aegean to challenge.

02:35.660 --> 02:38.100
Allied Intelligence learned
of the projected blitz...

02:38.340 --> 02:40.740
...only one week before
the appointed date.

02:40.940 --> 02:45.180
What took place in the next six days
became the legend of Navarone.

05:52.140 --> 05:53.180
Yes?

05:53.380 --> 05:55.020
I'm looking for
Commodore Jensen.

05:55.420 --> 05:56.780
I'm Jensen.

05:57.860 --> 05:58.780
Come in, Mallory.

06:02.060 --> 06:03.380
You're late.

06:07.980 --> 06:11.220
I'm sorry. Our plane was attacked
an hour out of Crete.

06:11.460 --> 06:13.780
We got into Alex
on one engine, sir.

06:14.020 --> 06:18.820
The Germans have a price on you and
Andrea Stavros of 1 0,000 pounds apiece.

06:19.660 --> 06:20.780
How did you know that?

06:20.980 --> 06:22.700
I should do. I'm your boss.

06:23.060 --> 06:25.740
You've been working for me
the past 18 months.

06:26.460 --> 06:28.980
I'm delighted to make
your acquaintance.

06:29.180 --> 06:30.980
Did they say
you were going on leave?

06:31.180 --> 06:32.340
Yes, sir. They did.

06:32.620 --> 06:35.020
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm afraid that's not true.

06:35.220 --> 06:36.660
Not yet, at any rate.

06:37.860 --> 06:40.380
Here's your old chum.
Come and say hello to him.

06:40.620 --> 06:42.700
You haven't changed since Athens.

06:43.180 --> 06:44.660
Hello, Roy.

06:45.260 --> 06:47.020
Come along gentlemen, will you?

06:55.580 --> 06:56.460
Barnsby...

06:57.220 --> 06:59.500
...these gentlemen have
an interest in Navarone.

07:00.060 --> 07:04.820
We've heard you on radio, but perhaps
you'll be more specific now.

07:05.940 --> 07:07.380
I'll be specific.

07:07.980 --> 07:10.300
As you can plainly see,
it was bloody awful!

07:11.020 --> 07:13.780
Squadron Leader Barnsby's Australian.

07:14.260 --> 07:16.620
But we'd love to go back,
wouldn't we boys?

07:16.860 --> 07:19.540
- Sure! Right!
- Just as soon as we can! But...

07:20.660 --> 07:22.540
...only on one condition.

07:23.060 --> 07:26.420
We want the joker who thought
of this to come with us...

07:26.940 --> 07:28.660
...and when we get there...

07:28.940 --> 07:32.100
...we're gonna shove him
out at 10,000 feet...

07:32.340 --> 07:33.580
...without a parachute.

07:33.820 --> 07:35.100
Bloody right.

07:35.780 --> 07:37.780
- It was bad as that?
- Bad?!

07:38.460 --> 07:41.300
It can't be done.
Not from the air, anyway.

07:41.660 --> 07:45.100
You're sure about that, squadron leader?
This is important.

07:45.340 --> 07:46.820
So's my life!

07:47.220 --> 07:49.820
To me, anyway. And the lives
of these jokers here...

07:50.060 --> 07:52.780
...and the 18 men we lost tonight!

07:56.060 --> 07:57.140
Look, sir...

07:57.980 --> 07:58.940
...first...

07:59.860 --> 08:03.460
...you've got that old fortress
on top of that bloody cliff.

08:03.660 --> 08:05.980
Then you've got
the bloody cliff overhang.

08:06.180 --> 08:09.620
You can't even see the bloody cave,
let alone the guns.

08:10.540 --> 08:13.700
And anyway, we haven't got
a bloody bomb big enough...

08:13.940 --> 08:15.980
...to smash that bloody rock.

08:16.980 --> 08:18.700
And that's the bloody truth, sir.

08:21.660 --> 08:23.420
I know how to hit those guns.

08:23.660 --> 08:24.460
Yes?

08:24.780 --> 08:25.700
Yes, sir.

08:26.180 --> 08:28.340
You fill a plane full of TNT...

08:28.940 --> 08:33.059
...and then you do a suicide
dive right into that cave.

08:33.740 --> 08:35.700
There's just one problem, sir:

08:36.340 --> 08:38.980
Getting someone to pilot the plane.

08:41.460 --> 08:44.700
I see. Perhaps you might
consider it yourself.

08:46.820 --> 08:49.540
Thank you, squadron leader,
and all of you.

08:49.780 --> 08:53.580
I know you've done your best,
and nobody could have done more.

08:54.540 --> 08:55.700
And I'm sorry.

09:03.180 --> 09:07.820
As you've probably surmised, I'm the
joker they'd heave out at 10,000 feet.

09:08.060 --> 09:09.820
And I can't say I blame them.

09:10.060 --> 09:13.260
I knew it was hopeless from the start,
but it had to be tried.

09:13.460 --> 09:16.980
Anyway, this is why you
were hauled out of Crete.

09:21.940 --> 09:23.860
And don't mislay this, will you?

09:24.060 --> 09:25.020
No, sir.

09:25.220 --> 09:28.580
We're pressed for time.
Let's go, gentlemen, shall we?

09:41.340 --> 09:43.620
- Any questions?
- Only one.

09:44.580 --> 09:45.540
Why me?

09:47.460 --> 09:50.260
What you want is
a seagoing taxi driver.

09:50.740 --> 09:52.980
Other men know these waters
as well as I do.

09:53.180 --> 09:55.300
Yes, but you've got
special qualifications.

09:55.540 --> 09:58.380
Franklin'll explain it.
It's his idea, anyway.

09:58.780 --> 10:01.620
First, you speak Greek and German.

10:01.860 --> 10:05.660
Second, you've kept alive in occupied
territory for a year and a half.

10:06.140 --> 10:10.420
And before the war, you were the
greatest mountain climber in the world.

10:10.660 --> 10:12.580
'' Keith Mallory, the human fly.''

10:12.820 --> 10:13.980
Come to the point, Roy.

10:14.580 --> 10:17.580
The point is that our Resistance
contacts on Navarone...

10:17.780 --> 10:21.420
...say there's only one spot on
the coast the Germans don't watch:

10:21.660 --> 10:24.300
The South Cliff.
It's 400 feet straight up...

10:24.540 --> 10:27.340
...and it can't be climbed
by man or beast.

10:27.860 --> 10:29.780
And that's where you come in.

10:30.340 --> 10:31.980
That was your idea too?

10:32.220 --> 10:33.460
That's right.

10:34.060 --> 10:38.380
I want you to get me and my team
over there and on top of that cliff.

10:38.580 --> 10:42.060
When you've done that, you can
take a richly deserved leave...{16049}{16098}...and a long-overdue promotion.

10:44.860 --> 10:46.260
I see.

11:03.260 --> 11:04.380
Can you do it?

11:08.660 --> 11:09.540
No.

11:10.060 --> 11:13.140
With all due respect,
I think the operation is insane.

11:13.860 --> 11:15.340
But that's not my business.

11:15.820 --> 11:19.180
My business is to climb
and I haven't climbed in five years.

11:20.060 --> 11:21.300
That's a long time.

11:21.740 --> 11:23.980
It's too Long for this cliff.

11:24.340 --> 11:26.780
And you're asking me
to do it at night.

11:30.660 --> 11:32.700
I wouldn't try it in broad daylight.

11:33.660 --> 11:36.060
I'll have a go myself, then.
I've climbed a bit.

11:36.300 --> 11:40.660
Don't be a fool. You'd get yourself
killed and your team along with you.

11:41.060 --> 11:43.580
- Then it's scrubbed?
- No, it's not scrubbed!

11:43.780 --> 11:45.060
It can't be.

11:46.700 --> 11:47.700
Not now.

11:50.580 --> 11:51.700
Mallory...

11:53.660 --> 11:54.980
...this is our last hope.

11:55.180 --> 12:00.100
The Germans won't expect
a team of saboteurs at this late date.

12:00.460 --> 12:03.900
Those 2,000 men on Kheros will
die next Wednesday morning...

12:04.140 --> 12:05.820
...unless someone climbs the cliff.

12:06.060 --> 12:09.340
There's nobody else
we can get in time.

12:11.940 --> 12:14.380
If there were,
you wouldn't be here now.

12:30.140 --> 12:33.140
I suppose it's too late to get
Andrea Stavros to help me.

12:33.980 --> 12:34.900
On the contrary.

12:35.460 --> 12:38.980
I think you'll find him waiting
for you in your hotel.

12:42.020 --> 12:43.460
You think of everything.

12:43.700 --> 12:46.180
I have to. It's part of my job.

12:46.380 --> 12:47.220
Thanks, Keith.

12:47.460 --> 12:48.740
It's my pleasure.

12:49.380 --> 12:52.260
Nothing I like better
than a well-organized setup.

12:52.460 --> 12:54.580
You'll want to know about the team.

12:54.820 --> 12:57.660
Sydney, would you get us
some more coffee, please?

12:58.260 --> 13:02.020
Franklin considers it the best team
in the business. I agree.

13:02.260 --> 13:06.580
He himself is ideal for the job.
He's experienced and extremely capable.

13:06.780 --> 13:08.140
Don't blush, Roy.

13:08.380 --> 13:11.020
And best of all, he's lucky.
Aren't you lucky?

13:11.260 --> 13:13.460
- If you say so, sir.
- I do, indeed.

13:13.660 --> 13:16.980
Napoleon said once, when somebody
was up for promotion to general...

13:17.220 --> 13:19.940
...''Yes, I know he's brilliant.
But is he lucky?''

13:20.140 --> 13:23.620
The emperor knew the value of luck.
Our Roy seems to have it.

13:23.860 --> 13:27.380
- Then make me a general, sir.
- Patience, my dear boy, patience.

13:27.980 --> 13:31.980
Now this is our Corporal Miller.
A chemistry professor in private life.

13:32.180 --> 13:34.500
An absolute genius
with high explosives.

13:34.740 --> 13:39.580
He blew up Rommel's headquarters with
no damage to the orphanage next door.

13:39.780 --> 13:43.020
They don't come any better. We tried
to make him an officer. He refused.

13:43.740 --> 13:46.420
This is '' Butcher'' Brown,
our mechanical marvel.

13:46.660 --> 13:50.180
He's a genius with engines,
machinery, radios, et cetera.

13:50.380 --> 13:52.940
And the best man
with a knife I've ever met.

13:53.180 --> 13:58.100
He got his training in Spain. The boys
call him the Butcher of Barcelona.

13:59.060 --> 14:01.700
Private Spyro Pappadimos.

14:04.860 --> 14:06.420
What's his particular genius?

14:06.660 --> 14:10.980
He's a born killer. A useful man
to have along on a job like this.

14:11.380 --> 14:15.700
His father happens to be our chief
resistance contact on Navarone.

14:16.060 --> 14:18.420
The boy went to America
to get an education.

14:18.980 --> 14:21.060
I'm afraid he got the wrong kind.

14:21.340 --> 14:23.180
Well, there's the team.

14:23.380 --> 14:25.820
Pirates and cutthroats,
every one of them.

14:26.260 --> 14:28.100
And of course, there's Lucky here.

14:28.420 --> 14:30.260
And the redoubtable Mr. Stavros...

14:30.500 --> 14:31.300
...and yourself.

14:32.220 --> 14:34.980
With every one of us a genius,
how can we fail?

14:35.220 --> 14:36.260
You can't.

14:36.740 --> 14:40.620
We're sending six destroyers through
the Navarone Channel next Tuesday...

14:40.860 --> 14:42.220
...to take the men off Kheros.

14:42.460 --> 14:44.780
If those guns aren't spiked by then...

14:44.980 --> 14:48.180
...there'll be six more ships
at the bottom of the Aegean.

14:52.060 --> 14:53.980
There's your car, gentlemen.

15:08.860 --> 15:09.860
Surprised?

15:10.860 --> 15:13.420
I didn't think I'd
see you again so soon.

15:13.860 --> 15:15.500
You thought you'd have
to look for me?

15:16.260 --> 15:18.420
When the time came,
I would find you.

15:22.620 --> 15:23.500
What is this?

15:26.180 --> 15:29.580
We have to ferry some operators
to an island called Navarone.

15:30.940 --> 15:33.020
- Do you know it?
- I know it.

15:34.060 --> 15:36.740
I also know I have
work to do on Crete.

15:37.620 --> 15:40.660
- Who's responsible for this?
- A major I used to know.

15:41.980 --> 15:43.260
Name of Franklin.

15:44.260 --> 15:47.580
He's a man who still has to prove
to himself he's a hero.

15:47.860 --> 15:50.140
I'll speak to Franklin.
Where do I find him?

15:52.260 --> 15:53.540
That's the man.

15:54.780 --> 15:56.980
You can speak with him on the way.

16:10.180 --> 16:11.700
Think they've got a chance?

16:12.740 --> 16:14.060
Frankly, no.

16:14.260 --> 16:16.220
Not a chance in the world.

16:19.620 --> 16:22.260
I'll be surprised if they
get halfway to Navarone.

16:22.460 --> 16:24.780
It's just a waste of six good men.

16:25.020 --> 16:29.780
However, it doesn't matter, considering
how many have been wasted already.

16:33.980 --> 16:35.980
I'm glad it's not my decision.

16:36.220 --> 16:38.180
I'm only the middleman.

16:42.060 --> 16:45.220
Still, they may get there
and they may pull it off.

16:45.460 --> 16:49.220
Anything can happen in a war.
In the middle of absolute insanity...

16:49.460 --> 16:51.700
...people pull out
extraordinary resources.

16:51.940 --> 16:55.060
Ingenuity, courage, self-sacrifice.

16:56.180 --> 16:59.580
Pity we can't beat the problems
of peace in the same way.

17:00.860 --> 17:02.620
It would be so much cheaper.

17:03.140 --> 17:05.579
I never thought of it
in just that way.

17:06.460 --> 17:07.660
You're a philosopher.

17:07.900 --> 17:08.740
No.

17:09.619 --> 17:13.140
I'm just the man who has to send
people out on jobs like this one.

17:49.580 --> 17:52.380
Must have been delayed.
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

18:11.820 --> 18:13.180
- Major Franklin?
- Right.

18:13.380 --> 18:16.540
My name's Baker. Sorry I was delayed.
Come with me, please.

18:16.940 --> 18:19.580
It's been so comfortable,
I hate to Leave.

18:23.780 --> 18:25.980
When you're all quite ready....

18:44.380 --> 18:47.660
Charming. Just like
an English country hotel.

18:47.860 --> 18:49.180
Where does everybody else sleep?

18:49.420 --> 18:52.820
Nobody sleeps. On your feet, professor.
We've got homework to do.

18:53.020 --> 18:54.620
If you insist, major.

18:55.580 --> 18:58.340
What are you doing, friend?
Looking for dust?

18:58.540 --> 19:00.260
No, friend. Microphones.

19:00.460 --> 19:02.620
This is the British Army Post.
Don't you trust anyone?

19:02.860 --> 19:05.500
No. That is why I have lived so Long.

19:05.740 --> 19:10.660
Mr. Stavros is Colonel Stavros
of the Greek 19th Motorized Regiment.

19:11.060 --> 19:13.020
- He outranks us all.
- It is of no moment.

19:13.260 --> 19:17.300
The 19th Regiment no longer
exists, for the time being.

19:17.540 --> 19:20.420
- I beg your pardon, colonel.
- Andrea.

19:21.820 --> 19:22.820
Please continue.

19:23.060 --> 19:25.300
Right. If you're ready, corporal.

19:25.540 --> 19:26.940
Yes, sir. Ready, sir.

19:27.140 --> 19:28.780
Ready, willing and able, sir.

19:29.740 --> 19:30.820
Champing at the bit.

19:31.060 --> 19:33.700
Captain Mallory and Andrea...

19:33.940 --> 19:36.660
...are responsible for getting us
to where we're going.

19:36.860 --> 19:39.220
I'll tell you where it is,
and why we're going.

19:39.460 --> 19:42.020
That is, if you really want
to know, professor.

19:42.260 --> 19:44.260
I'm all ears, sir. All ears.

19:44.820 --> 19:49.020
We must avoid the coast road.
That means a 12-mile trek...

19:49.220 --> 19:53.700
...to St. Alexis, where Resistance
people from the town of Mandrakos...

19:54.060 --> 19:56.540
...will come and meet us
if they can make it.

19:56.820 --> 19:58.180
Any questions?

19:58.660 --> 20:00.940
I have an alternative route
to that place.

20:01.140 --> 20:02.980
May I borrow your pencil, please?

20:07.220 --> 20:09.380
Does the major think this is possible?

20:09.620 --> 20:11.220
I see.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.100
That's a thought, isn't it?

20:13.340 --> 20:17.580
Well, let's reexamine the plan
and see if we have any alternative.

20:19.940 --> 20:20.740
Watch out!

20:25.220 --> 20:28.620
- How long has he been there?
- I heard something ten minutes ago.

20:28.860 --> 20:31.220
I thought my ears were playing tricks.
Then I heard it again.

20:31.460 --> 20:34.100
Ten minutes?
Brown, go and get Major Baker.

20:34.340 --> 20:35.420
Yes, sir.

20:35.660 --> 20:36.580
What's your name?

20:36.820 --> 20:38.180
What're you doing here?{30953}{31027}The major asked you a question!
Answer the major.

20:45.940 --> 20:48.220
Sounds like Kurdish.
I don't understand it.

20:48.420 --> 20:49.780
I'll try Greek.

20:58.220 --> 21:00.740
- Translation, please.
- He doesn't speak English.

21:00.940 --> 21:02.260
Why was he listening?{31599}{31654}-What are you doing to that man?
- You know him?

21:07.060 --> 21:10.820
That's Nicolai, our laundry boy.
Is he the reason I've been disturbed?

21:11.060 --> 21:12.420
I've had a hard day!

21:12.660 --> 21:14.580
Does his job involve
listening at keyholes?

21:14.820 --> 21:16.620
- I don't believe it.
- We caught him at it.

21:16.860 --> 21:19.380
It was just idle curiosity.
He doesn't speak English.

21:19.620 --> 21:23.100
Why does he listen?
And why did he try to stab this man?

21:23.340 --> 21:25.420
I presume he was trying
to defend himself.

21:25.660 --> 21:30.220
In this part of the world, carrying a
knife doesn't make you a criminal.

21:30.460 --> 21:31.420
Let him go.

21:31.660 --> 21:36.500
Major Baker, arrest this man and
hold him incommunicado for a week.

21:36.740 --> 21:40.060
After that, my advice is you
kick him out of Castelrosso.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.860
Who the hell are you to give
me advice, major?

21:44.540 --> 21:47.180
Then I'm asking you as a favour.

21:47.460 --> 21:48.820
I'll consider it.

21:49.060 --> 21:52.180
All this cloak-and-dagger stuff.
I said let him go!

21:52.380 --> 21:54.340
Pappadimos, have you got your silencer?

21:54.540 --> 21:56.620
Then use it. Shoot the laundry boy!

21:56.980 --> 21:57.780
Are you crazy?

21:57.980 --> 22:01.180
And if the major gets
in your way, shoot him too.

22:01.420 --> 22:03.180
That's an order.

22:11.460 --> 22:14.540
Captain, he's insane!
Surely you won't let him do this.

22:14.740 --> 22:17.620
I can't stop him, he's in charge.
Anyway, I agree with him.

22:18.020 --> 22:20.380
Of course, he doesn't have
to shoot you.

22:20.620 --> 22:25.460
He can just call our HQ and you'll
be on a troopship home, as a private...

22:27.940 --> 22:31.860
...unless you give him your word that
you'll do exactly as he says.

22:40.020 --> 22:40.980
All right.

22:41.740 --> 22:43.900
If it means that much to you,
you have my word.

22:44.140 --> 22:45.620
Take him, sergeant!

22:49.020 --> 22:51.020
Stupid theatricals.

22:51.820 --> 22:53.540
You're entitled to your opinion...

22:54.020 --> 22:56.180
...but I just saved your life.

23:16.980 --> 23:19.940
I'm desperately sorry, gentlemen.
Really, I am.

23:20.180 --> 23:22.540
It's embarrassing.
Just look at it!

23:22.780 --> 23:24.620
No, it's exactly what we want.

23:25.020 --> 23:28.700
They said you wanted a boat no one
would notice, but that's a disgrace!

23:29.860 --> 23:32.660
Give me 36 hours, and I know
I can lay my hands...

23:32.900 --> 23:36.060
...on a German E-boat in
absolutely perfect condition.

23:36.300 --> 23:38.660
I promise you, only one careful owner.

23:38.900 --> 23:40.940
I can pop over to Rhodes
and get it for you.

23:41.180 --> 23:43.460
Won't the Germans have
something to say about that?

23:43.700 --> 23:45.140
I suppose so, if they knew.

23:45.340 --> 23:48.460
But I've got good connections there.
What do you say?

23:48.700 --> 23:50.820
- No, thanks. We can't wait.
- Pity.

23:51.180 --> 23:53.860
I'll get my chaps to help
with your gear.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.300
No, that's all right, thank you.

23:56.700 --> 23:58.180
Right. I get it.

23:58.420 --> 24:01.780
Special cargo and all that, what?
Well, good luck to you.

24:09.100 --> 24:10.260
Brown?

24:11.100 --> 24:11.940
Yes, sir?

24:12.220 --> 24:13.740
What do you think?

24:14.900 --> 24:17.140
Well, she's a bit of a monster, sir.

24:17.380 --> 24:19.140
But I think I've got her worried.

24:22.740 --> 24:24.820
- Comfortable, professor?
- Yes, thank you.

24:25.020 --> 24:27.540
Matter of fact,
the boys have almost finished.

24:28.780 --> 24:30.140
Permission to speak?

24:30.500 --> 24:33.740
- What about?
- Well, the condition of this vessel.

24:34.380 --> 24:37.940
Talk to Captain Mallory.
He's in charge of transportation.

24:38.140 --> 24:39.060
Very good, sir.

24:40.500 --> 24:43.780
I've inspected this boat
and I think you ought to know...

24:44.020 --> 24:44.940
...I can't swim.

24:46.780 --> 24:47.820
I'll keep it in mind.

25:05.340 --> 25:07.140
Dead on ten, sir.

25:11.020 --> 25:13.540
Hello, Lucky. Hello, Lucky.

25:13.740 --> 25:17.140
Report my signal. Report my signal.

25:17.340 --> 25:19.580
Hello, George-Mike-William.

25:19.820 --> 25:22.580
Strength three. Strength three, over.

25:22.820 --> 25:23.940
Hello, Lucky.

25:24.380 --> 25:28.140
High Flight reports Indians
on warpath in your territory.

25:28.340 --> 25:30.180
So please be careful.

25:30.420 --> 25:34.340
Also, severe storms expected
throughout your area tonight.

25:34.540 --> 25:38.180
Repeat. High Flight reports
Indians on warpath....

26:51.980 --> 26:53.340
Ship ahoy!

27:01.620 --> 27:03.740
Go on working.
They'll have glasses.

27:55.900 --> 27:57.180
Lower your sails!

27:59.900 --> 28:02.020
Lower your sails!

28:02.620 --> 28:04.540
We are coming aboard!

32:06.300 --> 32:09.740
It's knee-deep in the hold,
but I think we'll manage.

32:11.060 --> 32:12.180
You want a breather?

32:12.420 --> 32:13.860
Wouldn't mind.

32:20.620 --> 32:24.340
Funny the way that German officer
spoke English to us back there...

32:25.340 --> 32:27.340
...almost as if he knew who we were.

32:27.940 --> 32:29.460
I had the same thought.

32:31.820 --> 32:35.140
I think our friend Baker
may have some explaining to do.

32:35.380 --> 32:36.660
I shouldn't have done it.

32:36.900 --> 32:37.900
What's that?

32:38.420 --> 32:39.780
Dragged you into this.

32:40.020 --> 32:41.260
I'm sorry.

32:41.620 --> 32:44.340
Forget it. I was getting tired
of Crete food anyway.

32:44.540 --> 32:46.540
No, I'm stupid sometimes.

32:47.020 --> 32:50.740
Even as a kid, I'd expect
people to play the games I liked.

32:50.980 --> 32:53.020
Then I'd get furious when they didn't.

32:54.020 --> 32:56.500
Well, now they have to, so why worry?

33:20.300 --> 33:21.180
Hot coffee!

33:21.420 --> 33:22.980
That's good.

33:29.620 --> 33:31.180
I'm sorry, captain.

33:31.420 --> 33:34.460
There's a serious shortage of cups
aboard this ship.

33:35.580 --> 33:37.940
I pointed out deficiencies
in this vessel.

33:38.140 --> 33:39.260
I remember.

33:44.100 --> 33:45.940
- Thanks.
- My pleasure.

33:48.020 --> 33:52.860
Any time you want another chat,
about this boat, I mean, I'm available.

33:53.100 --> 33:54.220
All right.

33:59.940 --> 34:01.980
And I still can't swim.

34:07.540 --> 34:09.940
Don't mind him.
He doesn't mean anything.

34:10.139 --> 34:13.780
I don't mind him as much
as he seems to mind me.

34:16.580 --> 34:18.100
Have you been together Long?

34:18.300 --> 34:20.179
Since the beginning out here.

34:20.380 --> 34:22.940
He's the best friend I have
in this part of the world.

34:28.739 --> 34:31.980
That's a pretty good partner
you've got there yourself.

34:32.540 --> 34:33.380
Yes.

34:37.020 --> 34:39.739
- We've been together a Long time too.
- You're lucky.

34:46.179 --> 34:47.980
He's going to kill me
when the war's over.

34:51.219 --> 34:53.420
- You're not serious.
- Yes, I am.

34:55.540 --> 34:57.139
So's he.

35:03.900 --> 35:07.060
About a year ago, I gave
a German patrol a safe conduct...

35:07.300 --> 35:09.380
...to get their wounded into hospital.

35:09.620 --> 35:13.740
I still had some romantic notions
about fighting a civilized war.

35:15.380 --> 35:18.140
Anyway, they wanted Andrea
pretty badly even then.

35:18.620 --> 35:22.340
They shot their casualties,
went to his house and blew it up.

35:22.660 --> 35:27.340
He was out on a job, but his wife
and three children were in the house.

35:29.900 --> 35:31.540
They were all killed.

35:32.180 --> 35:34.140
I helped him to bury them.

35:36.180 --> 35:38.980
He didn't say a word to me.
Never looked at me.

35:39.580 --> 35:43.740
But after it was over, he said that
as far as he was concerned...

35:45.220 --> 35:48.180
...it wasn't the Germans who were
responsible, but me.

35:49.220 --> 35:52.340
Me and my stupid Anglo-Saxon decency.

35:55.420 --> 35:57.580
He said what he
was going to do, and when.

35:57.820 --> 36:00.140
Do you think he still means to do it?

36:03.020 --> 36:06.620
He's from Crete.
Those people don't make idle threats.

36:10.820 --> 36:12.460
I thought I was getting leave.

36:12.700 --> 36:15.580
I was going to ask for
transfer to another area.

36:15.820 --> 36:19.100
Take some time to think,
get ready for him.

36:19.620 --> 36:21.060
And I messed that up.

36:21.700 --> 36:22.940
I'm sorry.

36:23.740 --> 36:25.260
That's all right.

36:25.620 --> 36:27.500
It's gonna be a long war.

36:28.540 --> 36:31.140
What makes you sure
he's gonna wait that long?

36:32.620 --> 36:35.180
I'm not. Not if he gets
the right opportunity.

36:40.340 --> 36:44.140
What I'm banking on is, that now
all he wants to do is to kill Germans.

36:44.740 --> 36:48.980
As long as I can be useful to him
in that department...

36:49.220 --> 36:51.740
...he'll do his best to keep me alive.

36:52.580 --> 36:53.380
I hope.

36:53.620 --> 36:55.340
That's nice of him.

36:56.780 --> 36:58.420
Well, I can see his point.

37:00.540 --> 37:04.300
The only way to win a war is to be
just as nasty as the enemy.

37:04.780 --> 37:08.660
I'm only worried we'll find out
we're even nastier than they are.

37:08.900 --> 37:10.740
I can't say that worries me.

37:10.980 --> 37:12.100
Well, you're lucky.

37:24.020 --> 37:26.340
Think I better
have a look at the hold.

37:28.140 --> 37:30.740
Before Miller tells me to!

50:25.980 --> 50:27.300
Help!

52:07.180 --> 52:08.940
We've saved the explosives...

52:09.180 --> 52:10.180
...the guns...

52:10.380 --> 52:12.220
...and most of the ammunition.

52:14.660 --> 52:17.980
I'm afraid we've lost the food
and the medical supplies.

52:18.180 --> 52:20.700
But if we rendezvous with
the Resistance...

52:20.940 --> 52:23.380
...at St. Alexis,
they'll supply us with both.

52:23.900 --> 52:26.500
Let's get out of this place
as quickly as we can.

52:27.500 --> 52:31.940
Pappadimos and Miller, you'll have
the first shift with the stretcher.

52:32.900 --> 52:35.420
You're officially taking command, sir?

52:37.460 --> 52:39.140
Yes, I suppose I am. Why?

52:39.380 --> 52:41.060
Just for the record.

52:58.460 --> 53:00.420
This afternoon on the boat...

53:01.700 --> 53:03.140
...you fumbled your job.

53:04.940 --> 53:06.220
How'd that happen?

53:08.540 --> 53:09.780
I don't know, sir.

53:10.900 --> 53:14.380
The man was a foot away from you.
You only wounded him.

53:14.580 --> 53:15.980
How could you miss?

53:18.180 --> 53:19.900
I must have hesitated, sir.

53:20.540 --> 53:22.100
You hesitated?

53:22.780 --> 53:24.700
A man of your experience?

53:25.380 --> 53:27.420
The Butcher of Barcelona?

53:27.900 --> 53:29.900
How could you hesitate?

53:30.900 --> 53:32.300
Well, I was tired.

53:33.780 --> 53:35.460
I'm tired and I'm fed up.

53:36.300 --> 53:38.500
I've been fighting
this war a long time.

53:39.180 --> 53:42.900
I've been killing Germans since 1937.
There's no end to them.

53:43.100 --> 53:45.300
Shoot a man at 200 yards,
he's just a target.

53:45.500 --> 53:47.300
You kill him with a knife...

53:48.180 --> 53:50.100
...you're close enough to smell him.

53:50.980 --> 53:52.900
I smell them in my sleep.

53:54.460 --> 53:58.300
After the last time, I made a pact
with myself: I'd do my job.

53:59.100 --> 54:01.100
But I wouldn't do the other anymore.

54:01.940 --> 54:03.420
Not if I could help it.

54:04.180 --> 54:07.300
And who gave you the right
to make a private peace?

54:08.860 --> 54:10.940
You think you're
the only one who's tired?

54:11.180 --> 54:12.380
I do my job, sir!

54:12.620 --> 54:15.460
Your job is to kill enemy soldiers.

54:50.180 --> 54:52.860
There will, of course,
be a code word.

54:53.180 --> 54:56.300
If we don't answer, a patrol
will be here in no time.

55:27.060 --> 55:28.740
Let's pack and get out.

55:54.460 --> 55:55.460
Let's go.

55:57.580 --> 55:58.580
Well?

56:02.300 --> 56:04.500
The major's leg is broken
in two places.

56:04.740 --> 56:07.660
He could be hurt inside too.
He needs medical attention.

56:08.100 --> 56:08.980
What do you suggest?

56:09.220 --> 56:12.540
- Leave him for the Germans.
- They'd get him to a hospital.

56:13.180 --> 56:16.700
If he doesn't get sulfanilamide,
he doesn't stand a chance.

56:16.900 --> 56:19.900
Naturally, you all think a lot
of Major Franklin. So do I.

56:20.100 --> 56:21.900
We have two choices.

56:22.500 --> 56:25.460
We can take him, and if he
doesn't get help, he'll die.

56:25.660 --> 56:29.540
Or we can leave him here,
and he'll tell the Germans everything.

56:29.980 --> 56:31.500
Roy? Never!

56:31.740 --> 56:33.980
He might not be able to help himself.

56:34.180 --> 56:36.300
They have other drugs besides sulfa.

56:36.540 --> 56:41.420
All they have to do is use scopolamine,
and he'll tell them our whole plan.

56:42.460 --> 56:44.900
There is, of course, a third choice.

56:45.180 --> 56:48.300
One bullet now. Better for him.
Better for us.

56:48.540 --> 56:51.140
You take that man along,
you endanger us all.

56:51.340 --> 56:53.500
Why not drop him off the cliff
and save a bullet?

56:53.700 --> 56:55.700
And why don't you shut up?

56:56.980 --> 56:59.300
Yes, there's a third choice.

57:00.260 --> 57:01.780
We'll make it if necessary...

57:02.500 --> 57:04.060
...when it's necessary...

57:04.420 --> 57:05.460
...and not before!

57:07.460 --> 57:08.460
Now let's move!

57:09.100 --> 57:13.500
Brown, from now on your job is
to look after Major Franklin.

57:16.460 --> 57:18.100
I said, move!

58:23.500 --> 58:24.700
Morning!

58:27.500 --> 58:28.500
I'm sorry.

58:28.700 --> 58:31.140
Don't be silly. It's just bad luck.

58:32.540 --> 58:34.140
Well, what do we do now?

58:35.180 --> 58:36.020
Where are we?

58:36.260 --> 58:37.660
We're on our way.

58:39.260 --> 58:41.900
- I'm going to hold you up.
- No, you won't.

58:42.540 --> 58:46.540
Anyway, the professor won the toss
and he's dying to carry you.

58:46.780 --> 58:49.700
That's right. You're not
nearly as heavy as I thought.

58:50.100 --> 58:51.060
Now look...

58:52.540 --> 58:54.340
...you've got to leave me.

58:54.700 --> 58:56.340
You're out of your mind.

58:57.180 --> 58:58.620
It's radio time.

58:59.300 --> 59:01.700
Well, it's all on your plate now.

59:03.860 --> 59:06.500
You'll never be able
to thank me enough.

59:08.060 --> 59:10.020
I wanted the job all the time.

59:34.100 --> 59:36.620
Hello, Lucky. Hello, Lucky.

59:37.060 --> 59:38.540
Report my signal.

59:38.780 --> 59:40.740
Hello, George-Mike-William.

59:40.980 --> 59:43.540
Strength four. Strength four, over.

59:43.780 --> 59:46.780
Hello, Lucky. This is most urgent.

59:46.980 --> 59:50.220
Paddington Station will close
at midnight, X minus one.

59:50.460 --> 59:54.220
Do you understand?
X minus one, over.

59:54.940 --> 59:56.500
We've lost a full day.

59:59.140 --> 01:00:01.900
Germans are gonna hit Kheros
a day ahead of time.

01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:07.100
Gives us until midnight,
the day after tomorrow.

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:13.100
Message understood.
Message understood. Over and out.

01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:59.500
I'd like to be alone with the major.

01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:31.100
Roy, that was foolish.

01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:36.980
You almost ruined everything.
We've just heard, we're canceled out.

01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:40.340
Scrubbed.

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:41.620
What?

01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:46.020
They're going for an amphibious
landing the day after tomorrow...

01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:48.740
...on the east coast.

01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:51.540
The Turkish side.{92796}{92826}The Turkish side?

01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:57.300
And they're coming in force.

01:01:57.540 --> 01:02:00.500
As far as we're concerned,
the pressure's off.

01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:03.940
All we have to do is
make as much trouble as we can.

01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:06.900
By tonight, we'll have you
in the hands of the underground.

01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:09.660
We'll have you taken care of.

01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:18.700
Try this again, I'll have Andrea
break your other leg.

01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:44.340
Good luck.

01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:46.420
Do not worry.

01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:49.580
I shall see you tonight
at St. Alexis.

01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:46.740
Good evening, gentlemen.

01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:53.020
Obviously, this place has
been used before.

01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:57.180
Any food around?

01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:00.340
I regret to say no.

01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:05.100
Weren't you careless?
We might have been anyone.

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:08.260
I heard you coming five minutes ago.

01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:17.860
No!

01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:25.900
Pappadimos, it's time
to relieve Andrea.

01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:27.620
I'll take it.

01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:28.940
No.

01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:33.100
Pappadimos...

01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:34.540
...you go.

01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:40.020
- Maybe he brought food.
- Hold it.

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:41.700
He might be faking.

01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:50.620
Saved!

01:06:58.140 --> 01:06:59.060
Don't move!

01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:02.220
Raise your hands!

01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:04.980
Raise your hands high!

01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:07.100
All of you!

01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:10.860
You there, with the food, speak!

01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:18.580
You are not Germans.

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:22.540
Which of you is Major Franklin?

01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:26.300
The man on the stretcher.
Who are you?

01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:28.660
My name is Maria Pappadimos.

01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:33.900
You may put your hands
down now, gentlemen.

01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:41.660
Pappadimos?

01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:44.700
They said Pappadimos was a man.

01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:47.300
My father. He was taken two days ago.

01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:48.820
He was taken?

01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:51.020
He told them nothing.

01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:52.780
He will die first.

01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:56.540
- You have sisters or brothers?
- A brother, Spyro, in America.

01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:03.100
Oh, he's not as far away as all that.

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:07.500
He's that handsome devil
right over there.

01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:16.220
Spyro!

01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:21.540
Why did you do that?

01:08:21.779 --> 01:08:24.700
To remind you to write
letters occasionally.

01:08:24.899 --> 01:08:27.740
- There's a war on!
- I mean before the war!

01:08:27.979 --> 01:08:31.700
I promised myself I would do this
the first time I saw you again.

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:35.660
Well, I'm sorry, brother.

01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:54.300
Which of you did this?

01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:55.340
Well....

01:08:55.540 --> 01:08:57.500
I'm afraid it was me.

01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:01.540
- Who is she?
- My friend, Anna. She's one of us.

01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:04.620
It's bad that this happened to her.

01:09:05.979 --> 01:09:09.220
Before the Germans came, she was
a schoolteacher in Mandrakos.

01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:13.100
Last year, she was caught.
They tortured her to make her betray us.

01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:16.500
They whipped her until
the white of her bones showed.

01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:20.500
Some nights, we could
hear her screaming.

01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:24.819
Then they kept her in
the fortress for six months.

01:09:25.020 --> 01:09:26.740
When they let her go...

01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:29.859
...she could not speak.

01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:34.420
She has never spoken since.
Not even in her dreams.

01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:38.060
Even I have never been allowed
to see the scars on her back.

01:09:38.939 --> 01:09:41.460
But she's a good fighter.
As good as any of you!

01:09:41.779 --> 01:09:43.460
Like a ghost, she goes anywhere!

01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:47.100
She got us these guns.
And she kills without mercy.

01:09:47.979 --> 01:09:50.300
You are very lucky, brother.

01:09:57.740 --> 01:10:00.620
No, they are the friends!
Our friends!

01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:05.500
It's gangrene, sir.

01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:09.140
If the leg doesn't come off, he'll die.

01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:10.580
Does he know?

01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:13.220
I don't think so.

01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:19.060
Sir...

01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:24.340
...I beg your pardon, but I haven't
had a chance to talk to you alone.

01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:28.900
I don't want to be left out anymore.
I want to be part of the team again.

01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:32.180
Please give me a chance.
You can trust me.

01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:34.700
I'll think it over.

01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:42.420
That's gangrene! What choice
do we have now, captain?

01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:44.740
- Who relieved you?
- She did.

01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:48.540
- In future, take orders only from me.
- I asked you a question, sir!

01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:50.500
And I heard you, corporal.

01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:56.300
Get yourself something to eat.
That's an order.

01:12:57.060 --> 01:12:58.340
Thank you, sir.

01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:07.740
There's a lot of activity down there.
I can hear it.

01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:10.660
They're turning Mandrakos inside out.

01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:14.100
As soon as they move out,
we'll move in.

01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:16.300
We're gonna get you to a doctor.

01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:18.980
Brown says that you are doing well.

01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:23.260
Brown is a liar. And so are you.

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:26.540
I haven't lost my sense of smell,
you know.

01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:30.300
I just hope the doctor's
a good surgeon.

01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:34.500
I wonder what old Jensen would say?

01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:37.900
My luck seems to have changed,
doesn't it?

01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:41.700
I don't suppose I'll ever
be a general now.

01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:52.900
This Franklin...

01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:55.700
...he's not a bad fellow.

01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:57.820
No, not bad at all.

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:33.980
- You're sure there's a tunnel there?
- They'll never find us.

01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:37.180
Well, they found us here.
Let's go. Let's go!

01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:11.100
Oh, excuse me.

01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:15.100
- Where is this tunnel?
- Up here, sir.

01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:56.820
Where does this lead to?

01:16:57.060 --> 01:17:00.100
We'll come out just behind Mandrakos.

01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:01.860
All right.

01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:04.100
Let's keep going.

01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:17.180
Anna?

01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:19.940
Anna?

01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:28.580
You're limping. Are you hurt?
Do you need help?

01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:09.060
Thank you, old bean.

01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:19.220
Get off your behinds.

01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:29.900
Think there's a fire escape?

01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:13.340
These are fine people.

01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:22.700
Give up quietly, gentlemen.

01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:26.900
Unless you want many innocent
people killed, as well as yourselves.

01:23:49.580 --> 01:23:51.180
Turn around, please.

01:23:54.980 --> 01:23:57.740
Captain Mallory, you've made
a remarkable effort.

01:23:57.980 --> 01:24:00.780
Unfortunately, it was
doomed from the beginning.

01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:04.100
Will you tell me where you've
hidden your explosives?

01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:05.900
No.

01:24:06.380 --> 01:24:09.900
As your commanding officer,
Captain Mallory must play a heroic role.

01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:12.020
You needn't carry such a burden.

01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:15.740
You've all suffered a great deal.
Why prolong that suffering?

01:24:15.980 --> 01:24:17.900
For you, the war is over.

01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:23.300
Another officer is coming
to question you. A captain in the SS.

01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:26.500
His methods, quite frankly,
are most severe.

01:24:27.380 --> 01:24:30.900
None of you are in uniform.
Therefore, you're considered spies.

01:24:31.140 --> 01:24:32.700
You know the penalty for espionage.

01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:37.940
But if any one of you has the courage
to tell me where the explosives are...

01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:40.980
...I promise, you will not only
save your own life...

01:24:41.180 --> 01:24:43.300
...but the lives of your comrades.

01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:47.140
This will be your only chance.

01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:49.900
I do advise you to take it.

01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:53.620
Please, sir! I am no spy!
I am not one of them!

01:24:53.860 --> 01:24:55.340
You yellow--

01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:02.020
Go on.

01:25:02.260 --> 01:25:05.060
Sir, I swear to you, sir...

01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:08.420
...I'm just a poor fisherman.

01:25:08.700 --> 01:25:12.340
Two days ago these men killed
my sailors and stole my boat.

01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:13.900
They forced me to join them.

01:25:14.580 --> 01:25:16.900
Sir, I am their prisoner!

01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:19.700
Where did you learn
your English, fisherman?

01:25:20.180 --> 01:25:21.540
In Cyprus, sir.

01:25:21.980 --> 01:25:24.100
I swear to you, it's true.

01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:26.300
Aren't you Andrea Stavros?

01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:28.100
Colonel Stavros?

01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:32.100
Oh, no. No, sir.
My name is Nondus SaIonikus.

01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:34.900
I told you, I'm a fisherman from Cyprus.

01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:40.700
Then how do you happen to wear
a shoulder hoister?

01:25:43.580 --> 01:25:45.940
They forced me to wear it...

01:25:46.180 --> 01:25:48.500
...and made it a kind of joke.

01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:50.380
Where are the explosives?

01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:52.340
I swear, sir...

01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:56.100
...I would tell you if I knew.

01:25:56.780 --> 01:25:58.420
But see, they didn't say.

01:25:59.100 --> 01:26:01.340
The truth is, sir, they don't trust me.

01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:03.300
I don't blame them.

01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:18.340
The commandant will telephone
to congratulate you, Muesel.

01:26:18.580 --> 01:26:19.660
Thank you.

01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:24.100
I've questioned them about the
explosives, but they refuse to answer.

01:26:24.740 --> 01:26:26.740
The Greek claims he is not one of them.

01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:31.020
Now you! You are not
of this company, you say?

01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:32.500
No, sir, I'm not.

01:26:32.740 --> 01:26:34.180
You are a liar!

01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:39.900
- But Your Excellency--
- A liar!

01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:44.700
Come, come. That didn't hurt.

01:26:45.780 --> 01:26:48.900
- Where are the explosives?
- I don't know, Your Excellency.

01:26:49.140 --> 01:26:51.620
Your Excellency, I swear I do not know!

01:26:51.860 --> 01:26:55.380
I am not one of these men!
They forced me to join them.

01:26:55.620 --> 01:26:57.700
As I explained to the captain...

01:26:58.940 --> 01:27:00.380
...I'm just a...{130500}{130549}...poor fisherman from Cyprus.

01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:04.540
My name is...

01:27:05.060 --> 01:27:07.700
...Nondus Salonikus.

01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:09.340
I swear to you.

01:27:11.300 --> 01:27:15.300
These men stole my boat and then
they forced me to join them.

01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:16.740
Your Excellency--

01:27:17.020 --> 01:27:19.700
Your Excellency, I am their prisoner!

01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:46.740
Where are the explosives?

01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:51.900
I want an answer now, or I'll personally
rearrange this officer's splints.

01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:00.780
Very well.

01:28:05.860 --> 01:28:06.900
I can't!

01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:08.500
Please, I can't!

01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:09.700
I can't!

01:28:14.780 --> 01:28:16.940
- Get up!
- I'm sick! I'm sick!

01:28:17.180 --> 01:28:20.300
- Get up!
- Please! Oh, I'm sick!

01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:27.140
But I'm sick! No, please!

01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:28.420
Please, I'm sick!

01:28:28.660 --> 01:28:30.180
I'm sick! I'm sick!

01:28:38.140 --> 01:28:39.900
Call the sentry in.

01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:51.820
Now, Oberleutnant...

01:28:52.780 --> 01:28:54.220
...get on the phone.

01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:58.900
Tell them you're not to be disturbed
until you give further orders.

01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:05.020
Remember...

01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:07.260
...I speak German...

01:29:08.540 --> 01:29:09.860
...perfect.

01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:21.220
Not very hygienic, I must say.

01:29:21.460 --> 01:29:23.300
Shocking taste in undies too.

01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:24.500
Ah, well....

01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:26.060
Heil, everybody!

01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:45.420
Roy...

01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:47.580
...we're gonna leave you here.

01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:49.340
I understand.

01:29:53.780 --> 01:29:56.500
We're gonna let them
chase us around for a while.

01:29:57.260 --> 01:29:59.460
But the one thing they mustn't know...

01:30:00.260 --> 01:30:02.980
...is about the landing tomorrow night.

01:30:03.260 --> 01:30:04.540
Of course.

01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:08.180
Don't worry.

01:30:10.580 --> 01:30:11.820
Oh, thanks.

01:30:14.780 --> 01:30:15.900
Good luck.

01:30:20.180 --> 01:30:21.220
Hold it.

01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:25.460
We'll leave Major Franklin behind.

01:30:28.180 --> 01:30:29.660
He's a wounded officer.

01:30:30.580 --> 01:30:33.300
I expect him to get medical attention.

01:30:33.740 --> 01:30:36.500
We don't make war on wounded men.

01:30:38.140 --> 01:30:40.700
We're not all like Hauptmann Sessler.

01:30:43.340 --> 01:30:45.700
Now, where's the camp radio station?

01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:47.700
I will not tell you.

01:30:51.900 --> 01:30:55.100
You wouldn't hesitate to kill me
for any number of reasons.

01:30:55.540 --> 01:30:57.300
But not this one.

01:30:57.980 --> 01:31:00.300
In any event, I will not tell you.

01:31:15.180 --> 01:31:18.100
- So long, Roy.
- Good luck, Keith.

01:31:22.100 --> 01:31:23.780
Well, Lucky, I shall miss you.

01:31:27.180 --> 01:31:29.380
Try to be a bad patient, will you?

01:31:29.620 --> 01:31:32.500
Keep on asking for bedpans.
Drives them mad.

01:31:33.380 --> 01:31:34.700
I'll keep it in mind.

01:31:38.540 --> 01:31:40.700
When this is over,
you'll buy me a lunch.

01:31:40.900 --> 01:31:43.900
Roast beef, Yorkshire pudding,
a nice little red wine....

01:31:44.100 --> 01:31:46.140
Steak and kidney pie.

01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:48.900
Anything you say.
You'll be paying for it.

01:31:54.820 --> 01:31:57.500
And you, colonel, what a performance.

01:31:59.140 --> 01:32:00.500
All right.

01:32:55.180 --> 01:32:58.540
I hope you were right to leave
Franklin with the Germans.

01:33:36.380 --> 01:33:37.260
Sir?

01:33:37.580 --> 01:33:40.860
- Yes?
- No, not you, sir. Mr. Stavros.

01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:44.700
Tell me about yourself.

01:33:45.300 --> 01:33:47.380
- What do you want to know?
- Are you married?

01:33:48.380 --> 01:33:49.940
I have been married.

01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:53.740
My wife and children were killed.

01:33:59.140 --> 01:34:01.500
Have you killed many people?

01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:03.940
Only Germans.

01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:05.620
Oh, some Italians too.

01:34:06.580 --> 01:34:08.540
- Captain Mallory?
- Yes?

01:34:09.100 --> 01:34:10.820
You are a lucky man.

01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:12.060
Yes, I know.

01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:14.780
Mr. Stavros?

01:34:15.220 --> 01:34:16.020
Yes?

01:34:16.940 --> 01:34:18.020
I like you.

01:34:21.900 --> 01:34:22.820
I like you too.

01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:20.540
I don't know.

01:35:21.180 --> 01:35:23.900
Well, baby face,
I never would have known you.

01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:26.540
You better get rid of that
fuzz under your nose.

01:35:26.780 --> 01:35:28.620
No, I'm an officer, remember?

01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:31.020
You just picked the wrong uniform.

01:35:35.380 --> 01:35:39.100
Lights out in five minutes.
I want you as well-rested as possible.

01:35:39.380 --> 01:35:41.300
Now, first thing in the morning...

01:35:42.100 --> 01:35:45.300
...we'll ditch the truck and
get hold of another car.

01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:48.980
Then we'll pick up the explosives
and go into Navarone.

01:35:49.180 --> 01:35:52.580
We've got to be inside the fortress
by 10:00 tomorrow night.

01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:54.460
Might one inquire how?

01:35:55.380 --> 01:35:56.580
We're gonna walk in.

01:35:57.300 --> 01:35:59.300
Simply because of this masquerade?

01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:00.340
No.

01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:07.300
Because I told Franklin
our orders had been changed.

01:36:08.700 --> 01:36:10.300
That we weren't after the guns.

01:36:10.540 --> 01:36:13.740
That we were just to create a
diversion for an assault...

01:36:13.980 --> 01:36:16.540
...tomorrow night on the Turkish side.

01:36:16.740 --> 01:36:18.900
Now if my hunch is right...

01:36:19.100 --> 01:36:23.980
...the Germans will give him scopolamine
and that's what he'll tell them.

01:36:24.540 --> 01:36:28.260
They may not believe it, but they'll
be faced with the fact that he does.

01:36:30.380 --> 01:36:33.700
Now I'm gambling that
they'll clear out of Navarone...

01:36:33.900 --> 01:36:36.380
...and take up positions on the coast.

01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:37.540
Very clever.

01:36:40.740 --> 01:36:44.660
But that still leaves the garrison
inside the fortress...

01:36:44.980 --> 01:36:48.820
...and we get them out by having
Andrea, Pappadimos and Brown...

01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:52.700
...start up diversions
all over Navarone.

01:36:53.260 --> 01:36:55.540
If there's enough confusion going...

01:36:55.980 --> 01:36:58.740
...Miller and I should have
a chance to break in.

01:36:58.980 --> 01:37:03.420
At the same time, the girls will steal
the fastest boat they can find...

01:37:03.660 --> 01:37:07.860
...so we all have a chance of
getting out when this thing is over.

01:37:08.180 --> 01:37:10.020
Very clever, indeed.

01:37:10.860 --> 01:37:15.300
Suppose they don't have any
scopolamine? What happens then?

01:37:16.660 --> 01:37:19.500
Suppose they use the
old-fashioned methods?

01:37:19.980 --> 01:37:22.980
Suppose your ventriloquist's dummy
just won't talk...

01:37:23.220 --> 01:37:26.220
...because he's a good man?
He won't be easy to break!

01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:30.060
He may take a lot of punishment before
he tells them our plan!

01:37:30.540 --> 01:37:33.620
He may even die on them
and tell them nothing at all!

01:37:33.860 --> 01:37:35.260
Have you considered that?

01:37:38.100 --> 01:37:39.060
Yes, I have.

01:37:39.460 --> 01:37:41.220
I'll bet you have!

01:37:43.980 --> 01:37:46.700
I'll bet you've considered that
as far back as the cliff!

01:37:46.900 --> 01:37:48.060
You and your...

01:37:48.380 --> 01:37:50.260
...three choices.

01:37:51.660 --> 01:37:56.220
I'll bet that's why you dragged
him around with us all this time!

01:37:56.900 --> 01:37:58.980
If he lives, he'll never
be the same again!

01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:02.100
Do you know what you've done?

01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:05.780
You've used up
an important human being!

01:38:08.980 --> 01:38:11.340
Oh, I misjudged you.

01:38:11.780 --> 01:38:15.300
You're rather a ruthless
character, Captain Mallory.

01:38:17.260 --> 01:38:19.380
I didn't think of it
back on the cliff.

01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:21.340
But if I had...

01:38:22.540 --> 01:38:26.020
...I'd have done the same thing.
It's our only chance!

01:38:26.260 --> 01:38:28.740
Well, right now I say
to hell with the job!

01:38:28.980 --> 01:38:32.100
I've been on 100 jobs,
none of which altered the war.

01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:36.500
There've been 1,000 wars and there'll
be 1,000 more, until we're all dead.

01:38:36.700 --> 01:38:39.100
I don't care about the war anymore.
I care about Roy!

01:38:39.340 --> 01:38:41.140
And if Turkey enters on the wrong side?

01:38:41.380 --> 01:38:45.380
So what? Let the world bow itself
to pieces, as it deserves!

01:38:45.620 --> 01:38:47.900
What about the 2,000 men on Kheros?

01:38:48.100 --> 01:38:51.100
I don't know them.
But I do know the man on Navarone!

01:38:51.540 --> 01:38:55.420
Mr. Miller, the man was
finished when he fell.

01:38:55.620 --> 01:38:58.820
That's easy for you to say,
sitting there, drinking coffee!

01:39:11.780 --> 01:39:15.100
It's funny. I was grateful
when you left him behind today.

01:39:16.460 --> 01:39:18.300
I just hope before this job's over...

01:39:18.540 --> 01:39:22.020
...that I get the chance to use you
the way you've used him.

01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:28.460
I'm sorry, but I couldn't think
of any other way.

01:39:32.140 --> 01:39:34.300
Everybody get a good night's sleep.

01:39:35.340 --> 01:39:37.500
No matter how it goes tomorrow...

01:39:37.940 --> 01:39:39.500
...you're gonna need it.

01:39:41.580 --> 01:39:43.700
I'll take the first watch.

01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:51.700
Hello.

01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:12.700
Tell me, schoolteacher...

01:41:13.180 --> 01:41:15.660
...from a purely moral point of view...

01:41:17.340 --> 01:41:21.100
...bearing in mind that we represent
goodness and civilization...

01:41:22.060 --> 01:41:25.700
...do you think that what I did
was a civilized thing to do?

01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:25.060
They are burning Mandrakos...

01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:26.700
...in punishment.

01:46:38.540 --> 01:46:40.500
This part of town has been evacuated...

01:46:40.740 --> 01:46:43.700
...because the guns' vibrations
has weakened the houses.

01:47:36.260 --> 01:47:38.740
Where will the attacks come?

01:47:38.980 --> 01:47:41.700
On the Turkish side.

01:47:41.980 --> 01:47:43.260
What time?

01:47:43.460 --> 01:47:44.273
What time?

01:47:44.275 --> 01:47:47.747
(in German)
- Let me do the surgery or he'll die.

01:48:12.540 --> 01:48:15.700
Is the timetable clear?
Any questions?

01:48:17.580 --> 01:48:18.420
Good luck.

01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:35.100
I won't be needing this.
You take it.

01:48:36.660 --> 01:48:37.660
Spyro.

01:48:39.260 --> 01:48:40.420
Andrea.

01:48:48.380 --> 01:48:50.260
Everybody stay where you are.

01:48:50.460 --> 01:48:52.300
The party's over.

01:48:52.740 --> 01:48:54.860
Somebody's stepped on the cake.

01:48:56.060 --> 01:48:58.900
Exhibit A: A clockwork fuse.

01:48:59.140 --> 01:49:01.700
Elementary and archaic,
but they work.

01:49:01.900 --> 01:49:03.900
This one won't work anymore.
Know why?

01:49:04.140 --> 01:49:07.100
The clock's okay,
but the contact arm's broken off.

01:49:07.300 --> 01:49:10.900
It could tick until Christmas
and not even set off a firecracker!

01:49:13.260 --> 01:49:16.300
Exhibit B:
Exhibit B is missing.

01:49:16.540 --> 01:49:20.500
All my slow burning fuses are gone.
Disappeared! Vanished!

01:49:20.980 --> 01:49:23.700
Exhibit C: My time pencils.

01:49:24.660 --> 01:49:27.340
75 grains of fulminate of mercury
in each of them.

01:49:27.580 --> 01:49:32.500
Enough to blow my hand off.
And very unstable, very delicate.

01:49:41.980 --> 01:49:44.260
Which means there's
a traitor in this room.

01:49:44.980 --> 01:49:46.740
You're crazy.
It happened at base.

01:49:47.020 --> 01:49:50.500
No, I'm not that crazy!
I checked it all before I left base.

01:49:51.380 --> 01:49:52.980
No, here.

01:49:53.340 --> 01:49:54.540
Here!

01:49:54.780 --> 01:49:56.340
Someone here.

01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:00.900
But who?

01:50:01.700 --> 01:50:02.740
Who?

01:50:02.980 --> 01:50:05.820
This stuff's only been
out of my sight two times.

01:50:06.060 --> 01:50:10.100
Once was when Andrea and Maria
took it away to hide it.

01:50:12.260 --> 01:50:14.780
But it was all right
when we picked it up again.

01:50:14.980 --> 01:50:17.700
The only other time was
when we left it in the truck...

01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:19.220
...and we scouted the gates.

01:50:19.460 --> 01:50:20.580
All of us!

01:50:24.180 --> 01:50:25.900
Except her.

01:50:26.860 --> 01:50:28.820
We left her on guard in the truck...

01:50:29.060 --> 01:50:30.260
...alone.

01:50:30.780 --> 01:50:31.940
You are crazy, sir!

01:50:32.980 --> 01:50:35.180
Let me just think for a moment.

01:50:40.540 --> 01:50:43.940
Since we got here, we've jumped
out of one frying pan into another.

01:50:44.180 --> 01:50:45.180
Just think....

01:50:46.100 --> 01:50:48.300
We were hiding in the carob grove...

01:50:48.580 --> 01:50:51.300
...and she's up in a tree.
Remember?

01:50:51.540 --> 01:50:54.420
Anybody can signal an airplane
with tin or a mirror.

01:50:54.660 --> 01:50:56.700
And they found us there,
didn't they?

01:50:58.100 --> 01:50:59.500
And then in the tunnel.

01:50:59.740 --> 01:51:02.940
In the tunnel she lagged far behind,
with a shocking limp.

01:51:03.180 --> 01:51:04.620
Seen her limping lately?

01:51:04.980 --> 01:51:07.860
But being behind us,
she could leave some messages.

01:51:08.380 --> 01:51:12.220
So when you take Roy to the doctor,
the Germans are waiting for you.

01:51:12.460 --> 01:51:14.900
When she takes us to her place,
they come there.

01:51:15.140 --> 01:51:16.300
But she got us out.

01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:20.300
Of course! That house would be
a shambles and she'd be dead with us.

01:51:20.580 --> 01:51:22.500
So what does she do?

01:51:23.020 --> 01:51:26.540
She disappears into the bedroom
to change her clothes...

01:51:26.780 --> 01:51:28.900
...and to leave a little note.

01:51:29.380 --> 01:51:31.900
She takes us to the wedding
and we're caught...

01:51:32.140 --> 01:51:34.020
...because we can't get to our guns!

01:51:34.260 --> 01:51:37.100
But even if we can, we slaughter
half of Mandrakos!

01:51:37.300 --> 01:51:39.700
You are an insane man!

01:51:40.500 --> 01:51:41.420
Am I?

01:51:42.540 --> 01:51:44.100
Maybe I am.

01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:46.140
Nothing surprises me anymore.

01:51:53.700 --> 01:51:56.100
We can settle this thing very easily.

01:51:56.380 --> 01:51:59.020
Let's see those scars
the Germans made on her back...

01:51:59.580 --> 01:52:01.020
...those terrible scars.

01:52:03.340 --> 01:52:05.100
How about it, Maria?

01:52:05.580 --> 01:52:07.620
Don't you want to see those scars?

01:52:35.340 --> 01:52:36.700
Q.E.D.

01:52:54.500 --> 01:52:56.500
You cannot believe it?

01:52:58.500 --> 01:52:59.700
Believe it.

01:53:00.940 --> 01:53:02.820
I cannot stand pain.

01:53:05.100 --> 01:53:08.580
It's easy to be brave when you're free,
when you're with friends.

01:53:09.140 --> 01:53:10.620
But I was caught.

01:53:11.260 --> 01:53:14.900
The others were free but they didn't
help me. I was alone.

01:53:16.460 --> 01:53:18.380
I was alone in their hands.

01:53:19.780 --> 01:53:22.900
They said they would put me
into their brothels.

01:53:23.260 --> 01:53:25.300
They said they would torture me.

01:53:28.660 --> 01:53:31.220
I saw what they did to other people.

01:53:38.540 --> 01:53:41.060
I'm sorry.
I cannot stand pain.

01:53:46.460 --> 01:53:47.980
When we got here...

01:53:50.900 --> 01:53:52.900
...why didn't you put in with us?

01:53:55.780 --> 01:53:58.140
You could have come with us!

01:53:59.860 --> 01:54:02.140
It was your only chance
to get free of them!

01:54:02.340 --> 01:54:04.380
There was never any chance.

01:54:05.060 --> 01:54:06.700
You never had any chance!

01:54:07.260 --> 01:54:09.620
It was hopeless from the beginning.

01:54:10.140 --> 01:54:12.180
You'll never get out of here!
Never!

01:54:14.140 --> 01:54:16.220
I tried to tell you last night.

01:54:31.980 --> 01:54:33.780
Can you do anything at all?

01:54:34.140 --> 01:54:35.260
I don't know.

01:54:38.580 --> 01:54:41.100
There's always some way
to blow up explosives.

01:54:41.300 --> 01:54:43.900
The trick is not to be around
when they go off.

01:54:45.540 --> 01:54:47.980
But aren't you forgetting
something, captain?

01:54:48.340 --> 01:54:49.620
The lady.

01:54:50.460 --> 01:54:52.620
As I see it,
we have three choices:

01:54:52.860 --> 01:54:55.700
One, we can leave her here.
But she might be found.

01:54:55.940 --> 01:54:58.940
And in her case
they won't need a truth drug.

01:54:59.140 --> 01:55:02.460
Two, we take her with us.
But that makes things more difficult.

01:55:02.980 --> 01:55:04.500
And three....

01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:07.860
Well, that's Andrea's choice.
Remember?

01:55:11.460 --> 01:55:13.340
You really want
your pound of flesh.

01:55:13.580 --> 01:55:14.460
Yes.

01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:16.420
Yes, I do.

01:55:17.340 --> 01:55:20.340
I just couldn't manage to get
to sleep last night.

01:55:20.700 --> 01:55:24.700
- If you're anxious to kill her, do it!
- I'm not anxious to kill her.

01:55:24.940 --> 01:55:26.900
I'm not anxious to kill anyone.

01:55:27.140 --> 01:55:30.900
See, I'm not a born soldier.
I got trapped.

01:55:31.900 --> 01:55:33.540
You may find me facetious...

01:55:33.740 --> 01:55:38.180
...but if I didn't make some bad jokes,
I'd go out of my mind.

01:55:38.580 --> 01:55:41.060
No, I prefer
to leave the killing to you.

01:55:41.260 --> 01:55:44.180
An officer and a gentleman.
A leader of men, a hero.

01:55:45.180 --> 01:55:48.340
If you think I enjoy this, you're mad!
I never wanted it.

01:55:48.580 --> 01:55:51.020
I was trapped like you,
or anybody in uniform.

01:55:51.260 --> 01:55:53.420
You wanted it.
You're an officer, aren't you?

01:55:53.660 --> 01:55:56.820
I'll never want the responsibility
of an officer.

01:55:57.060 --> 01:55:59.860
Then you've had a free ride
all this time.

01:56:00.300 --> 01:56:04.420
Someone's got to be responsible.
Do you think it's easy?

01:56:04.700 --> 01:56:06.220
I don't know!

01:56:07.780 --> 01:56:11.380
I'm beginning to wonder who is
responsible to do the dirty work.

01:56:11.580 --> 01:56:15.100
Is the man who gives the orders guilty,
or the one who has to do it?

01:56:15.380 --> 01:56:18.100
- We've no time for this.
- Now just a minute!

01:56:18.500 --> 01:56:22.300
If we're gonna get this job done,
she has got to be killed!

01:56:22.700 --> 01:56:26.300
And we all know how keen you are
on getting the job done.

01:56:26.580 --> 01:56:29.580
I've never killed a woman before,
traitor or not...

01:56:29.780 --> 01:56:31.380
...and I'm finicky.

01:56:31.780 --> 01:56:36.140
So why don't you do it?
Why don't you let us off for once?

01:56:36.380 --> 01:56:39.340
Come on, be a pal.
Be a father to your men.

01:56:39.580 --> 01:56:44.100
Come down off your cross,
close your eyes and pull the trigger!

01:56:44.340 --> 01:56:45.620
What do you say, sir?

01:58:05.780 --> 01:58:08.500
You all know what you
have to do. Get started.

01:58:09.300 --> 01:58:11.660
Brown, you go with Maria.

01:58:41.060 --> 01:58:44.500
Now, you know when you put on a uniform
and learn how to do it...

01:58:44.700 --> 01:58:46.820
...it's not hard to kill anyone.

01:58:47.020 --> 01:58:48.740
Sometimes it's harder not to.

01:58:50.060 --> 01:58:53.860
You think you've been getting away
with it all this time, standing by.

01:58:54.100 --> 01:58:55.260
Well, son...

01:58:56.380 --> 01:58:58.540
...your '' by standing'' days are over.

01:58:58.780 --> 01:59:01.460
You're in it now, up to your neck!

01:59:02.300 --> 01:59:05.540
They say you're a genius with
explosives. Start proving it!

01:59:05.780 --> 01:59:08.100
You got me in the mood
to use this thing...

01:59:08.300 --> 01:59:12.100
...and by God, if you don't think
of something, I'll use it on you!

01:59:12.580 --> 01:59:13.420
I mean it.

01:59:15.140 --> 01:59:16.420
Go on.

02:04:53.180 --> 02:04:56.420
You stay here.
I'll call you if I need you.

02:04:56.660 --> 02:04:57.820
Whatever you say, sir.

02:11:17.140 --> 02:11:18.260
Spyro!

02:11:56.660 --> 02:11:58.420
Detonators, sir, please.

02:12:02.940 --> 02:12:05.300
I'll be finished here in about
30 seconds.

02:12:50.340 --> 02:12:51.420
Miller?

02:12:55.740 --> 02:12:56.820
Miller!

02:13:08.260 --> 02:13:09.860
Yes, what is it?

02:13:19.300 --> 02:13:20.700
What are you doing?

02:13:20.900 --> 02:13:23.820
They'll search those guns first
and find my stuff.

02:13:24.060 --> 02:13:25.620
They're not stupid.

02:13:25.860 --> 02:13:30.020
But if they remove it carelessly,
they could have the same result.

02:13:30.260 --> 02:13:32.900
But I'm banking on this job
being our insurance.

02:13:33.380 --> 02:13:36.580
- What happens?
- Would you bring down the hoist?

02:13:46.460 --> 02:13:47.620
Whoa, that's enough!

02:13:47.860 --> 02:13:49.500
See this bottom runner?

02:13:49.700 --> 02:13:53.500
When they send this hoist down for
shells or charges, it'll come here.

02:13:53.740 --> 02:13:56.900
It'll hit these
two wires and we get a circuit...

02:13:57.100 --> 02:13:59.940
...that'll send up
all my plastic explosives here...

02:14:00.180 --> 02:14:03.180
...plus this little item...

02:14:04.380 --> 02:14:05.780
...that I borrowed here.

02:14:07.540 --> 02:14:10.060
They won't see these wires
under the grease.

02:14:10.580 --> 02:14:12.300
Are you sure it'll work?

02:14:12.580 --> 02:14:15.340
No guarantee, but the theory's
perfectly feasible.

02:14:15.580 --> 02:14:17.500
But if this stuff goes up...

02:14:17.700 --> 02:14:20.660
...everything else in this place
will go up with it.

02:14:20.980 --> 02:14:23.300
Suppose you don't get a contact?

02:14:24.100 --> 02:14:27.740
Then I'll be responsible for sinking
one of the destroyers...

02:14:27.980 --> 02:14:29.900
...maybe the whole lot of them.

02:14:30.460 --> 02:14:34.100
I'm sorry, sir. It's the only way
I know to get the job done.

02:14:34.500 --> 02:14:36.300
As you said, I'm in it now...

02:14:36.540 --> 02:14:37.980
...up to my neck.

02:14:45.380 --> 02:14:46.660
Hurry up.

02:15:19.620 --> 02:15:20.980
- Go ahead.
- After you.

02:15:21.180 --> 02:15:23.060
Remember? I can't swim.

02:15:24.100 --> 02:15:26.060
You won't let me drown, will you?

02:18:08.139 --> 02:18:09.139
I can't make it.

02:18:09.540 --> 02:18:10.860
My arm....

02:18:18.500 --> 02:18:20.100
Come on, man. Take it!

02:18:21.860 --> 02:18:22.660
Grab it!

02:21:10.020 --> 02:21:12.260
Spyro's dead, isn't he?

02:21:13.940 --> 02:21:15.340
What happened?

02:21:18.100 --> 02:21:19.980
He forgot why we came here.

02:26:37.020 --> 02:26:39.660
And now you're going back to Crete?

02:26:40.420 --> 02:26:41.260
Yes.

02:26:44.220 --> 02:26:45.460
Come with us.

02:26:46.460 --> 02:26:47.660
With us?

02:26:48.940 --> 02:26:49.900
With me.

02:26:50.140 --> 02:26:51.660
I must go back.

02:26:52.220 --> 02:26:54.860
You saw what the Germans did
to Mandrakos.

02:26:55.100 --> 02:26:59.060
Navarone will pay heavily for
your success tonight.

02:27:05.900 --> 02:27:07.700
Come on,
I'll give you a hand.

02:27:07.940 --> 02:27:08.900
I'm going back.

02:27:10.740 --> 02:27:12.740
The job is finished.

02:27:12.940 --> 02:27:14.220
Your job is finished.

02:27:14.900 --> 02:27:18.460
What chance do you think you have
of staying alive back there?

02:27:20.420 --> 02:27:22.300
I'm not so easy to kill.

02:28:00.940 --> 02:28:03.860
Well, the boys on Kheros
will be happy soon.

02:28:05.700 --> 02:28:08.700
It'll be crowded, but
there's nothing like an ocean voyage:

02:28:08.940 --> 02:28:12.300
Fresh air, good food,
deck sports, pretty girls....

02:28:19.500 --> 02:28:21.700
I'd like to offer you
my apologies...

02:28:21.940 --> 02:28:23.660
...and my congratulations.

02:28:32.420 --> 02:28:34.700
The truth is,
I didn't think we could do it.

02:28:34.940 --> 02:28:37.460
To tell you the truth,
neither did I.

02:28:38.305 --> 02:28:44.709
