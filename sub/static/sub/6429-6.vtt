00:20.739 --> 00:23.241

00:23.309 --> 00:26.044
- claudia learned a great deal
about the warehouse,

00:26.111 --> 00:28.213
Whih could become
problematic.

00:28.280 --> 00:29.613

02:26.966 --> 02:29.233
- it was reated by
a little-known culptor

02:29.301 --> 02:30.335
Walter burleigh,

02:30.402 --> 02:31.635
And it was tolen
late last night

02:31.703 --> 02:33.737
From a high-end auction house
in new york.

02:33.805 --> 02:35.206
But that's not the issue.

02:35.274 --> 02:37.375
The isue is how this thing
was stolen, because--

02:37.443 --> 02:38.576
- i'm trying to figure out why

02:38.643 --> 02:40.445
After i just got back
into this world

02:40.512 --> 02:42.180
You're in such a rush
to hove me out the door.

02:42.247 --> 02:45.383
- because i didn't spend half
my life trying to save your life

02:45.451 --> 02:47.418
So you ould surf the net
and wath youtube.

02:47.486 --> 02:50.088
- well, excuse me for trying
to atch up on urrent events

02:50.155 --> 02:52.290
And the state of the world
in the last 1 years.

02:52.358 --> 02:53.391
- hey, we're working.

02:53.459 --> 02:54.392
We're working right here.

02:54.460 --> 02:55.559
- artie, i'm sorry,

02:55.627 --> 02:57.161
But apparently
i have to find a job.

02:57.229 --> 02:58.629
Don't know exactly
what i'm gonna put

02:58.697 --> 03:00.798
In that little gap
in my resume.

03:00.866 --> 03:02.433
- well, hey, what about what got
you there in the first place?

03:02.501 --> 03:03.767
- you!
- what?

03:03.835 --> 03:05.236
- don't you
have something to do?

03:05.304 --> 03:06.570
Like stay out
of federal prison?

03:06.638 --> 03:08.572
And aren't you upposed
to be writing me

03:08.640 --> 03:10.508
A full tehnial schemati
on how you racked my warehouse?

03:10.575 --> 03:12.377
- yeah, buddy. it's upstair.
it's almot finished.

03:12.444 --> 03:13.744
- well then,
i want you to finish it,

03:13.812 --> 03:15.846
And i want every rediret
and every backslash.

03:15.914 --> 03:18.082
Go. now.

03:18.150 --> 03:19.717
And then after that,
you're going into the warehouse

03:19.784 --> 03:22.786
And you're gonna re-wire what
you unwired when you broke in.

03:22.854 --> 03:24.055
- i'd like to unwire you.

03:26.858 --> 03:29.060
- ah.

03:29.128 --> 03:31.529
The patter of little feet.

03:31.596 --> 03:32.630
- all right, o, artie,

03:32.697 --> 03:34.399
Somebody boosts
an ugly sculpture.

03:34.466 --> 03:35.500
Why does that involve us?

03:35.567 --> 03:37.235
- okay,
what is signifiant here

03:37.302 --> 03:39.770
I how this thing was stolen.

03:39.838 --> 03:42.740
I mean,
this theft was...imposible.

03:42.807 --> 03:44.075
There was
a high-end alarm system,

03:44.143 --> 03:45.109
Eight-inch thick walls,

03:45.177 --> 03:46.377
Sealed vault.

03:46.445 --> 03:47.945
So one seond
that culpture was there,

03:48.013 --> 03:49.680
Next eond gone.

03:49.748 --> 03:53.151
- but it's till just
a well-executed art theft.

03:53.218 --> 03:55.819
I mean, it doesn't
automatically shout "warehouse,"

03:55.887 --> 03:56.921
Doe it?

03:56.988 --> 03:58.756
- things rarely
shout "warehouse."

03:58.823 --> 04:00.624
They usually whisper,

04:00.692 --> 04:04.095
"hey, that's a little odd."

04:04.163 --> 04:05.896
That's what they do.

04:05.964 --> 04:07.698
Well, i could be wrong.
i mean, it ould be nothing.

04:07.766 --> 04:09.067
But i'm probably not wrong.

04:09.134 --> 04:12.136
Last time i was wrong
was 187, june.

04:12.204 --> 04:14.138
- stop right there. that.

04:14.206 --> 04:16.207
I want to hear more about that.

04:16.274 --> 04:19.142
- not a chance. go.

04:19.211 --> 04:21.245
- okay.

04:21.313 --> 04:23.181
Here we go.

04:23.248 --> 04:26.084
Going.

04:26.151 --> 04:27.318
- go, go, go, go.

04:27.386 --> 04:28.852
- hey, artie.
- yeah?

04:28.920 --> 04:30.555
- hey, uh, you know
i love new york.

04:30.622 --> 04:31.889
- oh, a great town.
- it is.

04:31.957 --> 04:33.491
- yeah.
- so i was just thinking

04:33.559 --> 04:37.261
Maybe you guys ould kik down
some tikets to a show, or...?

04:37.329 --> 04:38.429
- well,
it depends on the show.

04:38.497 --> 04:40.631
- really?
- no. get out of here.

04:40.699 --> 04:41.599
Show.

04:41.666 --> 04:42.900
Like you're even gonna have time

04:42.968 --> 04:43.901
For a stupid musial.

04:43.969 --> 04:45.136
Or that i'd even pay for it.

04:45.204 --> 04:47.671
- off broadway's
not that expensive.

05:36.292 --> 05:37.626
- carruther' auction house

05:37.694 --> 05:39.294
Pride itself on eurity.

05:39.363 --> 05:41.530
Thi theft has us stumped.

05:44.568 --> 05:46.469
- video surveillance
shows nothing.

05:46.536 --> 05:48.471
- i'm assuming you use
an electronic lock

05:48.538 --> 05:50.305
That reords all activity.

05:50.374 --> 05:52.207
- and it ays the door
never opened.

05:52.275 --> 05:53.409
- who's selling the piee?

05:53.477 --> 05:54.543
- private etate.

05:54.611 --> 05:55.911
He deided to auction

05:55.979 --> 05:58.313
After he was approached
by two intereted parties,

05:58.382 --> 05:59.882
Both with deep pokets.

05:59.949 --> 06:02.251
- when is this auction,
uh, scheduled?

06:02.318 --> 06:05.320
- it was for today.

06:05.389 --> 06:08.056
Uh, i hate to ask,
but would you mind?

06:08.124 --> 06:11.560
- oh.

06:11.628 --> 06:14.397
- you know, maybe one of these
interested parties

06:14.464 --> 06:15.598
Hates competition.

06:15.665 --> 06:17.366
- whih would mean
that said party

06:17.434 --> 06:18.868
Has an artifact
that lets them pull off

06:18.935 --> 06:20.302
An imposible heit.

06:20.370 --> 06:22.004
- or the simple answer,

06:22.071 --> 06:25.408
An inside job.

06:25.475 --> 06:27.743
- she does bear scrutiny.

06:27.811 --> 06:29.111
- follow me.

06:29.178 --> 06:30.613
- yes, ma'am.

06:30.680 --> 06:31.814
- [clears throat]

06:31.882 --> 06:33.248
- she's out of your league.

06:33.316 --> 06:35.050
- how do you know
what my league is?

06:35.118 --> 06:36.452
- not that i ask for them,

06:36.520 --> 06:38.220
But i've got season tickets.

06:38.288 --> 06:41.089
- that's good.
i like it.

06:41.157 --> 06:43.692
So the thief take one piece.

06:43.760 --> 06:45.528
Was it the most valuable
one in here?

06:45.595 --> 06:46.995
- oh, far from it.

06:47.063 --> 06:48.397
But there's no
accounting for taste.

06:48.465 --> 06:49.498
- oh, i don't know.

06:49.566 --> 06:54.369
Some things
are just lassi.

06:54.438 --> 06:56.138
- pete.

stay here in the vault

07:02.479 --> 07:04.279

If we just worked together?

07:08.485 --> 07:11.086

07:11.154 --> 07:13.889
Look, thi way we can cover

To take, uh, skirt girl

10:41.564 --> 10:43.132
- no. no, i know that.

10:43.199 --> 10:44.266
But the feather,

10:44.333 --> 10:45.600
It only works
up to your elbow.

10:45.669 --> 10:47.803
- so not enough to get
in and out with the sculpture.

10:47.871 --> 10:50.973
- exactly, which means that thi
i only part of the artifact.

10:51.041 --> 10:53.042
It's not the whole thing.

10:53.109 --> 10:55.711

11:17.100 --> 11:19.668
A ceremonial objet,

11:19.736 --> 11:22.437
A walking stik,
a peace pipe maybe.

- or a bird.

11:27.510 --> 11:29.411
- yeah. any gues as to who
thi thing belonged to?

11:29.478 --> 11:31.479

one of the two guys

11:31.547 --> 11:33.048
Who wanted
to buy the culpture,

11:33.116 --> 11:34.616
But we haven't interviewed
one of them yet.

11:34.684 --> 11:36.651

A real estate swindler.

12:01.878 --> 12:05.147
And a ravager of ultures.

12:45.616 --> 12:47.717
Emergency exits

12:47.785 --> 12:50.287
- you think my oncern for you
i insincere?

12:50.355 --> 12:52.189
- i think you should pass me

12:52.256 --> 12:54.391
Those.

12:55.860 --> 13:01.031
- so...anxious

Your life's work is complete,

13:19.950 --> 13:22.185
And that cares you.

13:22.253 --> 13:26.323

and all done without a ouch.

13:28.292 --> 13:29.559
How much do i owe you,

13:29.627 --> 13:31.828
- if joshua

13:31.896 --> 13:35.765
Then your sacrifie
i justified.

13:35.833 --> 13:37.800
But you're alo afraid
of being alone.

13:40.238 --> 13:42.372
Truly alone.

13:42.440 --> 13:44.941
- it's okay if i don't

of the four elements.

14:25.649 --> 14:27.451
This one is fire.

14:27.518 --> 14:29.553

missing a feather would you?

15:27.378 --> 15:29.846
Maybe off something that lets

16:25.703 --> 16:27.204
If somebody's
walking through walls,

16:27.271 --> 16:29.639
The united states government

17:03.341 --> 17:04.406
I'm waiting

17:25.663 --> 17:26.963
She's taking a break.

17:27.030 --> 17:28.698
She's been working very hard.

17:34.238 --> 17:35.505

17:51.489 --> 17:53.222
Yes, they're both brilliant,

17:53.291 --> 17:56.192
But he's a researher,
and she's a doer.

17:56.260 --> 17:57.394
She needs people like her.

17:57.461 --> 17:59.996
- brash, rude,
anti-soial, impulsive?

18:00.063 --> 18:02.632

- whoa.

18:44.775 --> 18:46.810

22:18.849 --> 22:20.650

22:20.718 --> 22:22.351
Zero to 10.

22:22.419 --> 22:23.686
I didn't mean today.

22:23.754 --> 22:26.689
I was just looking

22:26.757 --> 22:30.459
- yeah, well,
artie made a few alls.

22:30.527 --> 22:32.128
And, uh,
there's a position at cern.

22:32.195 --> 22:33.229
I should take it.

22:33.296 --> 22:36.165
It's once in a lifetime.

22:36.233 --> 22:37.667
- you're going to switzerland?

22:37.735 --> 22:38.935
- yeah.
- smashing atoms?

22:39.003 --> 22:40.069
- like you aid,

22:40.137 --> 22:41.604
Can't spend the rest of my life

22:41.672 --> 22:44.573
Listening to pringsteen
and surfing the web.

22:49.613 --> 22:52.248
Hey.

22:52.315 --> 22:53.683
If an interdimensional rift

22:53.751 --> 22:55.351
Can't keep me
from being in touch with you,

22:55.418 --> 22:58.054
You think a few thousand
miles will?

22:58.122 --> 22:59.288
- well, you better.

22:59.356 --> 23:00.723
'cause i think
i've demonstrated

23:00.791 --> 23:02.258
I will hunt you down.

23:02.325 --> 23:04.160
- yeah.

23:04.227 --> 23:06.729
- well, come here.

23:06.797 --> 23:09.298
Come on.

23:15.873 --> 23:17.707
- pete's fine, but omebody else
could get hurt.

23:17.775 --> 23:19.341
I mean, where doe that
buckskin oat come from?

23:19.409 --> 23:21.110
Is it conneted
to the culpture omehow?

23:21.178 --> 23:22.311
- there are hundreds

23:22.379 --> 23:23.813
Of these native amerian
creation myths.

23:23.881 --> 23:25.081
- i know, i know.

23:25.149 --> 23:26.549
I still think
that the feather, however,

23:26.616 --> 23:27.984
Gives us our best clue.

23:28.052 --> 23:30.887
Anyway, the feather
was predominantly used

23:30.954 --> 23:33.089
By the delaware nations,

23:33.157 --> 23:34.891
And also by the...

23:34.958 --> 23:36.793
Aha. by the lenape tribe.

23:36.860 --> 23:41.630
They're the one who old
manhattan to the dutch

23:41.699 --> 23:44.033
For 2 bucks
worth of arts and craft.

23:44.101 --> 23:45.568
- that's not a great deal.

23:45.635 --> 23:46.869
- you had to be there.

23:46.937 --> 23:48.938
- and according
to lenape legend,

23:49.006 --> 23:52.008
The world was created through
the spirits of four element.

23:52.076 --> 23:54.577
Four.
fire, whih gave us our soul.

23:54.644 --> 23:55.945
Wind, our breath.

23:56.013 --> 23:57.379
Water, death.

23:57.447 --> 23:58.380
It's fascinating.

23:58.448 --> 24:00.817
And rock, whih have the w--

24:00.884 --> 24:03.886
Leena.

24:03.954 --> 24:09.826
Rock gave the world...solidity.

24:09.893 --> 24:14.964
- so omeone has a buckskin coat
that manipulate olidity.

24:15.032 --> 24:16.298
- no.
- i think that this whole thing

24:16.366 --> 24:17.800
Could be a pattern.

24:17.868 --> 24:21.637
Because if there are artifact
that ontrol the other elements,

24:21.705 --> 24:24.306
And somebody were to
acquirethose artifacts,

24:24.374 --> 24:26.142
That omebody would have

24:26.210 --> 24:29.879
Immense power over...
- the world.

24:29.947 --> 24:31.347
- at the risk
of ounding dramati.

24:31.414 --> 24:32.681
- that's never
stopped you before.

24:32.750 --> 24:34.683
- that's true.

24:38.255 --> 24:39.822
[farnworth beeps]

24:39.890 --> 24:41.423
- mama?

24:48.565 --> 24:52.201
Ow. ooh, ooh. a--ooh!

24:52.269 --> 24:55.171
[groans]

25:02.212 --> 25:03.746
- pete,
what took you so long?

25:03.814 --> 25:06.315
Uh, listen.

25:06.383 --> 25:08.484
Jeffery weaver...

25:08.551 --> 25:10.987
I think that that guy
needs a second look.

25:11.054 --> 25:13.222
- myka's taking
a look at him now

25:13.290 --> 25:15.892
Over dried turkey,
mushy vegetables,

25:15.959 --> 25:17.426
And tapioa pudding.

25:17.494 --> 25:18.928
- okay.
you're till in the hospital?

25:18.996 --> 25:21.664
- i got pushed out
of the ide of a teel truck.

25:21.731 --> 25:22.799
I'm recuperating.

25:22.866 --> 25:24.066
- yeah, well,
recuperate later.

25:24.134 --> 25:25.668
While myka's
keeping weaver busy,

25:25.735 --> 25:29.105
Uh, i'm gonna need you
to tos his apartment.

25:29.173 --> 25:31.040
- why steal his stuff
from himself?

25:31.108 --> 25:33.075
I weaver our guy?

25:33.143 --> 25:36.179
- well, tell me
what you find out,

25:36.246 --> 25:39.182
And i will let you know.

25:47.157 --> 25:48.791
- it's very romanti.

25:48.859 --> 25:52.261
- i had, uh, verna
turn up the steam tables.

25:52.329 --> 25:53.595
It's all about atmosphere.

25:53.663 --> 25:55.898
- well, you sure know
how to wow a girl.

25:55.966 --> 25:59.168
- it's my best move.

25:59.236 --> 26:03.372
So what made you join
the secret ervice?

26:03.440 --> 26:06.909
- [exhales] well, um...

26:06.977 --> 26:09.712
It was
either that or prison.

26:09.779 --> 26:09.846
I'm kidding.

26:12.515 --> 26:13.582
- what about you.

26:13.650 --> 26:16.953
I mean, what is it
you do exactly?

26:17.020 --> 26:18.988
- accrue interest.

26:19.056 --> 26:20.089
Re-invest.

26:20.157 --> 26:21.324
Try to do
something good with it.

26:21.391 --> 26:22.725
- that's a nie life.

26:22.792 --> 26:26.462
- yeah, well,
it depends on how you got it.

26:26.529 --> 26:27.796
- your father.

26:27.865 --> 26:31.334
- my father, yeah.

26:31.401 --> 26:32.735
- and you don't--

26:32.802 --> 26:34.403
You don't want
to follow in hi footteps.

26:34.471 --> 26:36.305
I that it?

26:36.373 --> 26:40.776
- i want
to erase hi footteps.

26:40.844 --> 26:43.145
What?

26:43.213 --> 26:44.947
What?

26:45.015 --> 26:46.415
- i'm just trying to deide

26:46.483 --> 26:51.587
If i'm itting here
with a good guy or a bad guy.

26:51.654 --> 26:54.390
- you know who was in business
with radburn year ago?

26:54.457 --> 26:56.259
- the other guy
who wanted the culpture?

26:56.326 --> 26:58.694
- that's right.
jeffery weaver's father.

26:58.762 --> 27:01.430
And both those guys tried
to push really hard at that time

27:01.498 --> 27:03.432
To ell them,
all four of the sculptures.

27:03.500 --> 27:04.867
- [sighs]
yeah.

27:04.935 --> 27:06.535
What do they do?

27:06.603 --> 27:07.569
- i don't know.

27:07.637 --> 27:09.105
I gues, you know,

27:09.172 --> 27:11.207
Something happens when you put
all four culptures together.

27:11.275 --> 27:12.441
My best guess, omething...

27:12.509 --> 27:13.876
- bad.

27:13.944 --> 27:15.444
- bad.
something bad.

27:15.512 --> 27:16.779
- you find anything
at weaver's yet?

27:16.846 --> 27:18.981
- no, i don't know.

27:19.049 --> 27:20.816
Thi place is clean.

27:20.884 --> 27:23.386
If he's the guy with the oat,
he probably...

27:28.491 --> 27:30.859
Oh, come on.
- what?

27:30.928 --> 27:32.728
- it's probably nothing.
i'll all you back.

27:32.796 --> 27:34.897
- no, no, no.
wait, wait. what?

27:42.539 --> 27:45.607
- you got to be kidding me.
what a hack.

27:49.980 --> 27:52.648
Bingo mania.

27:52.715 --> 27:56.018
- so what are you really after
in all this?

27:56.086 --> 28:00.156
And don't tell me
the government needs to know.

28:00.223 --> 28:01.757
- i'm here for the oat.

28:01.825 --> 28:05.461
And, yeah, the government
actually does want it.

28:05.528 --> 28:06.963
There are certain things

28:07.030 --> 28:08.597
That just shouldn't
be out in the world.

28:08.665 --> 28:10.899
- true.

28:10.968 --> 28:14.837
- but, you, you're only
interested in the sculpture.

28:14.904 --> 28:16.272
Why?

28:16.340 --> 28:18.174
They're not that valuable.

28:18.241 --> 28:19.741
- i think things
that were created together

28:19.809 --> 28:20.709
Belong together.

28:20.777 --> 28:22.711
- whoever's doing this,

28:22.779 --> 28:24.646
And i haven't
ruled you out yet,

28:24.714 --> 28:26.515
I alo colleting them.

28:26.583 --> 28:32.088
What happens when the four
sculptures are together?

28:32.155 --> 28:34.090
Seriously, jeff,
you should tell me,

28:34.157 --> 28:36.492
Before omebody--
[cell phone rings]

28:39.062 --> 28:41.330
Just give me a seond.

28:43.400 --> 28:45.368
- pete?
i everything okay up there?

28:45.435 --> 28:46.902
- yeah, i'm at weaver's.

28:46.970 --> 28:49.738
- what? wh--what are you--

28:49.806 --> 28:52.574
- the guy's got a secret room
that's a hrine to burleigh.

28:52.642 --> 28:54.676
He must have bought up
everything the guy ever touched.

28:54.744 --> 28:56.045
Whatever's going on,

28:56.113 --> 28:58.180
Your boyfriend's
neck deep in it.

28:58.248 --> 29:02.184
- i'll wrap thi up then.

29:02.252 --> 29:04.453
[clears throat]

29:04.521 --> 29:06.822
- so we should probably
head upstairs, huh?

29:06.890 --> 29:11.760
- you know, i'd really rather
go back to your place.

29:11.828 --> 29:13.162
- you know, it's funny.

29:13.230 --> 29:15.597
I usually like it when
a beautiful woman says that.

29:15.665 --> 29:17.033
- that is funny.
that is funny.

29:17.100 --> 29:20.136
Because i never like it
when my date lies to me.

29:30.933 --> 29:33.235
- you know, i don't--

29:33.303 --> 29:37.273
Burleigh was married
to a lenape woman.

29:37.340 --> 29:39.441
And the sculptures

29:39.509 --> 29:43.078
Are some kind of a key

29:43.146 --> 29:45.481
To a acred,
underground cave.

29:45.548 --> 29:46.915
- to a sacred what?

29:46.983 --> 29:48.183
- a cave.

29:48.251 --> 29:51.253
Uh, it ays
it ontains four offerings

29:51.321 --> 29:52.821
To the pirit of creation.

29:52.889 --> 29:55.357
Somehow he hid the diretions
to the ave

29:55.425 --> 29:57.125
In the culptures.

29:57.193 --> 29:59.227
- so those four sculpture,

29:59.296 --> 30:01.330
See, they're a map.

30:01.398 --> 30:02.864
If you put
the four sculptures together,

30:02.932 --> 30:05.267
They tell
you where thi ave i.

30:05.335 --> 30:07.002
- yeah, but how, artie?

30:07.069 --> 30:08.970
I mean,
we're missing something.

30:13.410 --> 30:15.877
- mr. radburn, we found
thi man trying to break in.

30:15.945 --> 30:17.813
- it's lacell, right?

30:17.880 --> 30:20.349
What do you do for me,
mr. lacell?

30:20.417 --> 30:22.584
- geologial urveys, sir.

30:22.652 --> 30:25.754
- that's right. you see
what's underground, don't you?

30:25.822 --> 30:30.125
And yet here you are,
lurking very high above ground.

30:30.193 --> 30:31.560
Find anything interesting?

30:31.628 --> 30:35.130
- no, sir.

30:35.198 --> 30:38.066
- you're not a very good liar,
mr. lacell.

30:38.134 --> 30:40.769
And you work for mr. weaver.

30:40.837 --> 30:42.871
Don't waste your breath
with denial.

30:42.939 --> 30:43.905
Was he wearing it?

30:43.973 --> 30:45.240
- yes, ir.

30:45.308 --> 30:50.879
- let me have it.

30:50.947 --> 30:52.280
Tell me about thi.

30:52.349 --> 30:54.516
- it's nothing.

30:54.584 --> 30:56.051
My father gave it to me.

30:56.118 --> 30:57.653
- don't you mean your uncle?

30:57.721 --> 31:00.789
As i aid before, deception
i not your strong suit.

31:00.857 --> 31:04.059
Walter burleigh was your uncle,
wasn't he?

31:04.126 --> 31:06.628
Why do you think
that i hired you?

31:06.696 --> 31:09.130
I had hoped you would lead me
to the place.

31:09.198 --> 31:12.368
Your uncle hid lue
to the sacred cave in his art.

31:12.435 --> 31:13.569
What's this?

31:13.636 --> 31:18.206
Water, rok, wind.

31:18.274 --> 31:19.508
Well, that's helpful.

31:19.576 --> 31:23.779
Now i know how
to arrange the culptures.

31:23.847 --> 31:25.814
Wait for me outide.

31:30.019 --> 31:32.254
But what then?

31:32.321 --> 31:34.923
How does it work?

31:34.991 --> 31:36.525
How will they lead me
to the place

31:36.593 --> 31:39.628
Where the objects are hidden?

31:39.696 --> 31:41.597
- i don't know.

31:41.664 --> 31:42.598
Give that back.

31:42.665 --> 31:48.136
You have what you want.

31:48.204 --> 31:49.405

32:39.956 --> 32:41.557
I--i don't know what that means,

32:41.624 --> 32:43.959
But it's--it's written
all over burleigh's notes.

32:44.026 --> 32:45.594

33:01.243 --> 33:04.680
Look, artie, how much of this
stuff do we really believe?

33:04.747 --> 33:06.515
- well, enough that
if he's looking for thi ave,

33:06.583 --> 33:07.850
It's better
that we find it firt.

33:07.917 --> 33:10.519
- i would agree with that.

33:10.587 --> 33:12.855
Your partner's already
got me overed.

33:12.922 --> 33:14.422
- lucy, you've got
some 'splaining to do.

33:14.491 --> 33:15.858
- so where's the ode?

33:15.925 --> 33:17.559
- gilbert radburn
beat me to it,

33:17.627 --> 33:18.994
Same way he's been
trying to find the ave.

33:19.061 --> 33:20.261
- what ave?

33:20.329 --> 33:21.997
- underground, sacred.
chek it out.

33:22.064 --> 33:24.366
- we have to top him.

33:24.433 --> 33:25.968
Like you said,
there are some things

33:26.035 --> 33:27.402
That hould not be out
in the world.

33:27.470 --> 33:29.204
- yeah, well, what about
that big guy

33:29.271 --> 33:30.171
That works for the two of you?

33:30.239 --> 33:32.440
- lacell is lenape.

33:32.509 --> 33:34.042
He want to save the ave too.

33:34.110 --> 33:36.277
He's been my eyes
at radburn's digs.

33:36.345 --> 33:38.346
He hasn't cheked in either.
i think something's happened.

33:38.414 --> 33:39.815
- okay, so we have to
find this cave

33:39.883 --> 33:41.483
Before radburn does.

33:41.551 --> 33:42.851
- well, if he's got
all four culptures,

33:42.919 --> 33:44.419
He ould be there now.

33:44.487 --> 33:46.354
- we've got all of
burleigh's note right here.

33:46.422 --> 33:48.590
- well, that hasn't helped me
solve it yet.

33:48.658 --> 33:50.225
- true, mr. weaver.

33:50.292 --> 33:52.594
But...you're not me.

33:52.662 --> 33:54.863
And right now we need to find
the location of that ave

33:54.931 --> 33:56.064
Before radburn does.

34:38.507 --> 34:40.275
- the truth i in the dawn.

34:49.284 --> 34:52.120
Of oure.
it's a map.

35:04.366 --> 35:06.434
Thank you.

35:11.507 --> 35:13.775
- so burleigh stopped
taking note

35:13.843 --> 35:15.176
When he got cloe
to finding the ave.

35:15.244 --> 35:16.912
- yeah.

35:16.980 --> 35:18.313
- it's like he realize
the stories were true

35:18.380 --> 35:20.048
And stopped writing
anything down.

35:20.116 --> 35:21.382
- well, you know, i think
it may be enough

35:21.450 --> 35:22.618
Because i found all these
old maps, and i--

35:22.685 --> 35:24.853
- knok knok.

35:24.921 --> 35:27.288
- i wish you wouldn't do that.
- [guffaws]

35:27.356 --> 35:29.057
- god! not funny.

35:29.125 --> 35:31.059
H-h-hang on.

35:31.127 --> 35:32.327
- i just ame by
to grab my tool

35:32.394 --> 35:33.629
And then i'm hitting
the proverbial road.

35:33.696 --> 35:34.796
I'm thinking vegas.

35:34.864 --> 35:36.431
"really? vegas, claudia?

35:36.499 --> 35:38.500
Remember, always hit
on 16, never on 1."

35:38.567 --> 35:41.169
- there's gotta be a lenape
settlement here somewhere

35:41.237 --> 35:42.570
And it's gotta be
somewhere safe.

35:42.639 --> 35:43.805
- yeah, and they'd look
for a place

35:43.873 --> 35:46.074
With special properties.

35:46.142 --> 35:47.943
- it's gotta be--it's gotta
be omewhere afe.

35:48.011 --> 35:50.445
So...no, this is not--

35:50.513 --> 35:52.280
What--hey, hey!

35:52.348 --> 35:54.850
- dude, have you onsidered
mathing these

35:54.917 --> 35:56.317
Against magneti ley line?

35:56.385 --> 35:58.920
- no, you don't...

35:58.988 --> 36:01.790
- one runs right along
the east edge of the island.

36:05.662 --> 36:06.828
- right there.

36:06.896 --> 36:09.631
- thi is the south--

36:09.699 --> 36:12.400
- an underground ave
in manhattan, huh?

36:12.468 --> 36:14.069
You know, if no one's run
into it...

36:14.137 --> 36:16.138
- in all these year,
then we can eliminate

36:16.205 --> 36:19.041
Everywhere where they've dug
for major utility junctions...

36:19.108 --> 36:20.876
- and subways.
this looks right.

36:20.943 --> 36:23.945
- indeed it does.

36:24.013 --> 36:26.081
Guys, i think i've got it.
i've got it.

36:26.149 --> 36:28.516
[chuckles] it i
lower east ide.

36:28.584 --> 36:31.319
Corlear's hook.
that is, um...

36:31.387 --> 36:34.656
That is just south
of the williamsburg bridge,

36:34.724 --> 36:36.457
And it's right near
the water,

36:36.525 --> 36:38.760
And it's gotta be away
from the ubway lines.

36:38.828 --> 36:42.964
And claudia
pointed...out...

36:43.032 --> 36:47.002
The...uh...

36:47.070 --> 36:50.005
- radburn's building there.

36:50.073 --> 36:52.240
He's been digging everywhere
that burleigh focused

36:52.308 --> 36:54.976
Using new construction
to over his hunt.

36:55.044 --> 36:57.145
- then he's cloe
to finding it.

36:57.213 --> 36:58.313
Okay, artie,
we're heading out.

36:58.380 --> 36:59.447
- yeah, okay,

37:08.490 --> 37:09.825
- we an blow it
in five minutes.

37:09.892 --> 37:11.359
- i need the ontents
of the ave to be intact.

37:11.427 --> 37:12.493
Nothing can be diturbed.

37:12.561 --> 37:14.395
- content?

37:14.463 --> 37:15.831
Well, if it's
a surgial blow,

37:15.898 --> 37:18.533
I say we blast

37:18.601 --> 37:20.568
And go ideways the last
couple of feet by jackhammer.

37:20.636 --> 37:21.937
- you just get me

37:22.004 --> 37:23.338
I'll take care

38:31.173 --> 38:33.008
It's all true.

38:40.549 --> 38:43.184
The water of eternal life.

38:50.359 --> 38:53.361
Oh. whoa!

39:01.838 --> 39:05.107

of nature herelf.

39:19.421 --> 39:20.789
[workers houting]

39:20.857 --> 39:23.025

40:18.715 --> 40:20.515

40:20.583 --> 40:21.717
You don't know

40:21.784 --> 40:24.019

40:24.087 --> 40:25.620
Thi is what i was

40:25.688 --> 40:27.422

40:27.489 --> 40:30.025
Okay, radburn,

40:30.093 --> 40:32.961
[both grunting]

40:35.698 --> 40:37.632
- put it back, gil.

40:39.335 --> 40:41.703
- not for you, jeff.

40:41.771 --> 40:44.472
And so was your father.

40:52.014 --> 40:55.751
Then nothing an top me.

40:55.818 --> 41:01.022

41:03.092 --> 41:04.692
