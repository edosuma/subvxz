00:34.160 --> 00:37.311
Inspired by real events.

00:41.680 --> 00:45.719
In the winter of 1940 the
British and German fought in Norway.

00:47.280 --> 00:51.353
The goal was to gain control over the
iron ore supply from Norway.

00:52.680 --> 00:56.593
There was fighting between German bombers
and British fighter planes.

02:37.960 --> 02:41.157
- Are there any casualties? Strunk?
- No.

02:41.320 --> 02:44.551
- Schwartz?
- I have been hit in the elbow.

02:44.720 --> 02:46.438
Hauk?

02:46.600 --> 02:48.477
- Hauk!
- Hauk is dead.

03:30.240 --> 03:34.358
Sergeant, take care of the airman's
wounds. Disinfect and bandage it.

03:34.520 --> 03:37.717
I will go and find out
which way to go.

03:37.880 --> 03:41.509
Am I going to die?
I'm not going to die right?

03:41.680 --> 03:46.310
The wound is in the elbow, airman. In the elbow.

03:47.520 --> 03:49.590
Ready?

03:57.200 --> 04:01.910
Why did he fly on? Everything
said we have to turn back.

04:02.080 --> 04:05.629
It's allright, it's useless to worry about it now.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.549
Lieutenant? Lieutenant!

04:24.680 --> 04:26.432
Lieutenant!

04:28.520 --> 04:31.080
- Schopis!
- I'm down here!

04:34.360 --> 04:36.555
Under the snow!

04:47.920 --> 04:49.990
What happened?

04:51.360 --> 04:54.796
I fell down there.
That's what happened.

05:02.120 --> 05:04.076
Excellent.

05:05.160 --> 05:09.199
- Joseph, your book.
- What do you have there?

05:09.360 --> 05:12.875
I waited for six hours
at Alexanderplatz in Berlin.

05:13.040 --> 05:17.716
Finally, Hitler came by.
It's his autograph.

05:17.880 --> 05:20.872
Biscuits, chocolate, sausage,
sauerkraut and beer.

05:21.040 --> 05:24.589
- Beer?
- You never know, Lieutenant.

05:24.760 --> 05:28.355
Yes. You are right.

05:30.280 --> 05:32.635
What do we do now?

05:42.520 --> 05:46.638
We march to the coast,
find our army and go to war again.

05:55.600 --> 05:59.229
And Officer Hauk fell for his country.

07:20.080 --> 07:26.713
"In time of need, where others despair, heroes rise
from seemingly innocent children -

07:26.880 --> 07:30.998
- filled death defying
determination and icy cool head."

07:32.120 --> 07:34.680
"But..."

07:34.840 --> 07:38.879
"It's almost always necessary
to call the genius to the plane."

07:39.040 --> 07:43.192
"The Hammer of Fate that would pound others
into the ground -

07:47.720 --> 07:50.996
- suddenly meets with steel..."

07:51.160 --> 07:53.754
It's as if Hitler was speaking to me.

07:53.920 --> 07:55.956
To us.

07:58.440 --> 08:00.749
Don't you understand?

08:00.920 --> 08:05.198
We were alone against three enemy planes,
and we survived.

08:05.360 --> 08:10.195
And we shot one of them down. It's
Minus 20 degrees, and we're not freezing.

08:10.360 --> 08:14.273
Turn off the light.
We need the battery.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.878
We can't go anywhere.

08:54.120 --> 08:55.758
Look out!

08:55.920 --> 08:57.512
Strunk!

09:01.560 --> 09:05.155
- The sled is too heavy!
- Release the belt.

09:05.320 --> 09:10.110
- What?
- I say again! Release the belt!

11:24.240 --> 11:26.708
Oatmeal.

11:26.880 --> 11:28.677
Do we have water?

11:29.520 --> 11:31.954
Strunk, fire up the oven.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.151
Norwegians are thorough people.

11:39.120 --> 11:40.633
- Shit!
- What?

11:40.800 --> 11:42.756
Only two.

12:02.360 --> 12:04.874
Can you hear it?

12:23.640 --> 12:26.279
I hate this fucking white.

12:26.440 --> 12:29.750
I hereby declare this shithole part of the German Reich.

12:30.840 --> 12:34.719
- Stop!
- Who's there?

12:34.880 --> 12:38.793
Stop! Don't move! Who is there?

12:38.960 --> 12:41.713
Beg your pardon?

12:41.880 --> 12:44.235
English?

12:47.600 --> 12:49.795
Who are you?

12:51.560 --> 12:56.076
- A British officer and his airman.
- What are you doing here?

12:57.040 --> 13:01.238
Our aircraft's been shot down.
About two miles from here.

13:16.480 --> 13:20.155
- And who might you be?
- We are german pilots.

13:20.320 --> 13:22.470
We've been shot down too.

13:31.880 --> 13:33.438
Well...

13:35.680 --> 13:38.592
- Come in
- Lieutenant?

13:41.800 --> 13:42.915
Thank you.

13:56.840 --> 14:00.150
I suppose there's no chance for a spout of tea.

14:05.320 --> 14:07.993
Lieutenant Horst Schopis.

14:09.960 --> 14:13.635
Sergeant Wolfgang Strunk
Airman Josef Schwartz.

14:13.800 --> 14:17.679
Hi. My name is Captain Davenport,
and this is my gunner Smith.

14:23.720 --> 14:27.315
- Where did you spend the night?
- In the plane.

14:27.480 --> 14:31.359
- And you?
- In a snowcave.

14:36.160 --> 14:38.958
A hunting cabin I presume.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.270
Room for everyone.

14:41.440 --> 14:45.115
- Why don't Smith and I sleep over here?
- No.

14:48.200 --> 14:51.829
- Those are our beds.
- Your beds?
- Yes.

14:52.000 --> 14:57.358
We've all just arrived here
how can they be your beds?

14:58.440 --> 15:04.197
- It is best you sleep over there.
- Why?
- Listen. We were friendly. We invited you in.

15:04.360 --> 15:07.272
Indeed you did, but this is a Norwegian cabin.

15:07.440 --> 15:11.638
Who do you imagine the owners would
want to share with? You or me?

15:11.800 --> 15:14.633
If we are in a german occupied country, it will be me.

15:14.800 --> 15:17.758
And sooner or later this will be a part of Germany.

15:17.920 --> 15:20.957
Now go over there and sit!

15:21.120 --> 15:25.830
I'm a British officer and I have no intentions
of taking orders from you.

15:43.640 --> 15:47.872
It is five o'clock and you are now officially
prisoners of the Third Reich.

15:48.040 --> 15:51.715
I order you to go over there!

15:53.480 --> 15:56.790
- Fuck the Third Reich.
- Hold your mouth!

15:58.560 --> 16:02.269
- Never say that again!
- These are exceptional circumstances Lieutenant.

16:02.440 --> 16:05.750
- We need to work together.
- We will work together Captain.

16:05.920 --> 16:09.310
But you will be our prisoners.

16:11.320 --> 16:14.835
Lieutenant shouldn't we shoot them?

16:15.880 --> 16:19.236
- No.
- English please.

16:20.520 --> 16:24.115
- Why not?
- We are not hottentots Schwarz.

16:24.280 --> 16:26.316
- English please.
- Quiet!

16:26.480 --> 16:30.792
But they would kill us if they had the opportunity.
I'm sure of that.

16:30.960 --> 16:33.679
Well then go.

16:36.720 --> 16:40.190
- I should shoot them?
- Yes.

16:40.360 --> 16:44.035
Yes. You have my permission.

16:44.200 --> 16:46.668
Well then go.

16:51.640 --> 16:54.029
You're gonna shoot me?

16:56.360 --> 16:59.796
But they yould also be useful as hostages

16:59.960 --> 17:04.556
And they can lay a false trail in the snow,
when we leave here.

17:05.760 --> 17:09.877
- So I should let them live?
- Yes.

17:10.040 --> 17:12.234
I think that would be the best.

17:14.319 --> 17:17.517
You ought to be holding a rattle for children,
not a gun.

17:17.680 --> 17:23.038
Hands on the bed. I'm not asking gentlemen!
Hands on the bed!

17:25.960 --> 17:28.952
We're unarmed. Un Armed!

17:31.280 --> 17:33.999
- Very nice. We'll put the stove on. (?)
- I'll have that back if you don't mind.

17:34.160 --> 17:36.355
We take care of the fire, we keep the lighter.

17:36.520 --> 17:40.911
That was a present from my father on my fifteenth birthday.
He gave it to me for good luck.

17:41.080 --> 17:43.594
Good luck Captain?
Look around.

17:43.760 --> 17:47.036
When we leave I will give you back the lighter.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.998
You have my word.

17:50.160 --> 17:54.312
No. I keep the lighter,
and whenever you need it you come to me.

17:54.480 --> 17:57.836
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Why are you making problems from such a little thing?

17:58.000 --> 18:02.710
It's not a little thing, and as far as I can see,
you're the one making the problem.

18:07.040 --> 18:09.918
Bloody Germans.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.796
Away!

18:16.960 --> 18:18.996
Quiet!

18:43.400 --> 18:47.916
I want to make a few things clear.
You're prisoners of war.

18:48.080 --> 18:51.231
And you'll stay with us in this cabin
until the weather improves.

18:51.400 --> 18:56.599
Tomorrow we will go to the sea and from there
you will be taken to a prison camp.

18:56.760 --> 19:00.275
- Is that clear?
- I think he's made himself perfectly clear.
Don't you Smith?

19:00.440 --> 19:03.477
Sure put to the points sir.

19:15.920 --> 19:19.196
This is the British side,
and this is the German side.

19:19.360 --> 19:23.148
You will ask permission every time
you want to leave the British side.

19:23.320 --> 19:25.754
If not, we will shoot you.

19:25.920 --> 19:27.717
Is that understood?

19:30.200 --> 19:32.191
Yes.

19:32.360 --> 19:37.912
Well. In that case, in accordance
with the Geneva convention -

19:38.080 --> 19:41.470
- i believe we're entitled to a bed,
three meals a day -

19:41.640 --> 19:44.393
- and sporting facilities.

19:44.560 --> 19:47.472
Do not worry.
You will be treated fairly.

19:47.640 --> 19:50.837
I'd hardly call your poilicy
of sharing fair.

19:51.000 --> 19:56.393
Under the circumstances many would say
putting a bullet into your head is fair.

19:56.560 --> 19:58.596
You get the same food we get.

19:58.760 --> 20:02.309
Bed and shelter?
You get the same shelter we get.

20:02.480 --> 20:04.835
And for sporting facilities...

20:05.000 --> 20:09.835
May I introduce you to the
beautiful Norwegian countryside!

20:13.560 --> 20:16.358
Any questions?

20:17.840 --> 20:20.354
Where's the toilet?

20:22.480 --> 20:25.438
Toilet is out there on the left.

20:27.840 --> 20:30.638
Here. Toiletpaper.

20:30.800 --> 20:33.268
That's not toiletpaper.

20:43.560 --> 20:45.710
Smaller pieces.

20:47.520 --> 20:51.479
Annoy them anyway you can Smith.
Provoke them.

20:51.640 --> 20:54.154
Make them feel stressed and insecure.

20:54.320 --> 20:56.754
- Got that?
- Yes sir.

21:01.080 --> 21:03.310
Strunk will go with you.

21:03.480 --> 21:06.472
And bring back more firewood.

21:23.880 --> 21:26.599
What was your name again?

21:28.240 --> 21:30.674
Me Smith.

21:32.080 --> 21:34.674
One more time.

21:34.840 --> 21:39.118
Me Smith. You...?

21:39.280 --> 21:41.748
- What's your name?!
- Strunk.

21:52.440 --> 21:54.510
So Skunk.

21:55.680 --> 21:57.557
How do you like Norway?

22:01.480 --> 22:05.029
Didn't think so.
Me neither.

22:06.520 --> 22:10.638
Is it true you can't eat other than sausages?

22:12.520 --> 22:15.637
Hey skunky!
How come you're not cold?

22:15.800 --> 22:19.429
Maybe you're too fucking stupid to feel cold.

22:35.160 --> 22:37.515
Is everything allright?

22:39.520 --> 22:41.033
Ye.

22:41.760 --> 22:44.149
Help him!

22:44.320 --> 22:45.548
Go!

22:52.160 --> 22:54.435
We must fix your bandage.
Strunk!

22:54.600 --> 22:59.037
- Big bum don't speak a word of English.
- He doesn't speak German either, Smith.

22:59.200 --> 23:01.430
- Who's side are you on sir?
- Shh!

23:08.880 --> 23:11.678
- Is it bad?
- No no.

23:13.320 --> 23:18.713
- The wound just have to be cleaned.
- Ooh. Nasty wound. Well infect-

23:18.880 --> 23:22.668
You're not to cross that line unless I give you permission!

23:22.840 --> 23:25.400
Whatever you say.

23:28.840 --> 23:30.956
It's nothing.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.514
Just trying to help.

23:51.600 --> 23:56.071
I'm a British Officer in Her Majesty's Royal Marines, and Smith here is my airman.

23:56.240 --> 23:59.391
We refuse to eat off the floor.

24:00.320 --> 24:03.471
- Why make a problem out of this?
- This?

24:03.640 --> 24:08.236
We want to eat at the table. Like you.
Is that a problem?

24:13.800 --> 24:16.633
No. Not at all.

24:21.480 --> 24:23.710
Grab it.

24:32.560 --> 24:36.235
- Take a seat sir.
- Thank you Smith.

25:35.760 --> 25:39.275
Well... enjoy.

26:02.240 --> 26:05.676
- It's good.
- This? Hope you're fucking joking.

26:05.840 --> 26:09.753
- Makes strong.
-?

26:10.760 --> 26:16.676
- German soilders can march for days on this.
- Is that right? Germans don't eat much.

26:16.840 --> 26:21.277
- And how come you've invaded Poland?
Wasn't Germany enough?
- Hold your mouth!

26:24.480 --> 26:27.756
And you. Go to your bed.

26:34.080 --> 26:36.469
- Now you want it?
- No.

26:36.640 --> 26:40.918
I don't want a nazi to eat it.

26:43.520 --> 26:46.910
You should teach your airman
some manners and discipline.

26:47.080 --> 26:49.355
That's none of your business.

26:49.520 --> 26:52.114
Captain Davenport...

26:53.200 --> 26:57.432
You are right.
This is none of my business.

27:00.160 --> 27:05.598
Besides. Maybe my observer was
following my orders.

27:44.600 --> 27:48.354
Why can't we sit and
talk like civilized people?

27:48.520 --> 27:50.750
Just talk.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.958
A conversation?

27:56.120 --> 27:58.190
About what?

27:59.920 --> 28:01.956
Anything.

28:02.120 --> 28:04.714
Okay. Well what about politics?

28:07.920 --> 28:11.037
Not a good idea.

28:11.200 --> 28:13.270
Cars?

28:15.560 --> 28:19.235
Yes. Germany is known to build
the best cars in the world.

28:19.400 --> 28:25.350
Well certainly the most boring cars in the world.
British cars have elegance and style.

28:25.520 --> 28:29.069
- Yes. But they break dow all the time.
- So what?

28:29.240 --> 28:34.519
Would you marry a woman because she was reliable
and always serve dinner at seven o'clock?

28:34.680 --> 28:40.198
- Well I wouldn't hold that against heer.
- But where would that leave sensuality and adventure?

28:40.360 --> 28:43.750
Without the unexpected
people become bored.

28:43.920 --> 28:46.753
How do you Germans feel about Jesse Owens?

28:46.920 --> 28:51.118
Black fellow beat the shit out of your best men at the Olympics.

28:51.280 --> 28:54.556
- He was a great athlete and deserved to win.
- For God's sake guys!

28:54.720 --> 28:57.359
We're stuck in this shithole talking about petty matters -

28:57.520 --> 29:01.308
- when all we want to do is get
the hell out of here and back to our girls.
Right?

29:01.480 --> 29:03.914
- What?
- Girls.

29:05.080 --> 29:08.117
You do have girls in Germany don't you?

29:09.040 --> 29:14.512
Tonight I was supposed to be on a date with Sheila.
The new bartender back at the airbase.

29:14.680 --> 29:17.114
Blue eyes, flaming red hair -

29:17.280 --> 29:20.113
- and a figure, that would give a fellow a?

29:20.280 --> 29:24.432
They all tried their luck.
But not on your life.

29:24.600 --> 29:29.151
- But you had your luck with her?
- Indeed. I won her.

29:29.320 --> 29:32.198
Well actually she won me.

29:32.360 --> 29:35.989
See I'm a local darts champion
three times in a row.

29:36.160 --> 29:40.631
And when Sheila turns up I orderd me a pint.
She says to me:

29:40.800 --> 29:46.397
"Smith, I like you, and if you can
beat me in darts tonight I'm yours."

29:47.960 --> 29:52.317
- And uh. Did you beat her?
- She beat me three times in a row.

29:52.480 --> 29:54.471
Fair and square.

29:54.640 --> 29:59.839
And the day before we left she slides
this small piece of paper across the counter.
Just like that.

30:01.840 --> 30:03.990
What did the note say?

30:04.160 --> 30:07.596
"Can't wait for your game to improve"

30:07.760 --> 30:13.073
"Come and see me as soon as you get back."
Love Sheila.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.150
Then you shot us down.

30:25.440 --> 30:29.513
What about the big lug over there?
Who's the woman in his life?

30:29.680 --> 30:33.878
Strunk has a family.
Three kids and a lovely wife.

30:34.040 --> 30:38.591
- Does he ever speak to her?
- Sergeant Stunk makes his family very proud of him.

30:38.760 --> 30:42.275
He works for the family business.
2000 workers.

30:42.440 --> 30:45.796
And then he even volunteered
for the German Luftwaffe.

30:45.960 --> 30:50.192
- Why did he volunteer?
- To serve his country.

30:50.360 --> 30:54.592
And Hitler junior, who's the love of your life?
Your mother?

30:54.760 --> 30:57.593
His mother is dead.

30:57.760 --> 31:01.878
Well what about you?
Have you got anyone waiting for you?

31:02.040 --> 31:04.952
- Haven't we all?
- I certainly have.

31:07.520 --> 31:10.637
And talking about women,
time for washing the dishes now.

31:10.800 --> 31:13.234
- You and Smith will do it.
- You didn't answer.

31:13.400 --> 31:16.676
I did.
You will do the dishes now.

31:16.840 --> 31:21.516
- Oh well I'm afraid we cant.
- Why not?

31:21.680 --> 31:25.070
The kitchen's on the German side.

31:40.840 --> 31:45.914
Your compass contains alcohol.
It might kill the infection.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.719
Don't they teach you anything at the German Luftwaffe?

31:51.880 --> 31:56.635
Of course, but then we would
not have no compass, Davenport.

32:07.040 --> 32:12.273
So our position is 62 degrees
0 minutes and 33 seconds.

32:15.840 --> 32:19.674
- So we are...
- Four kilometres.

32:19.840 --> 32:24.789
- Planning our trip tomorrow?
- Yes.

32:24.960 --> 32:27.918
I think you'll find that West is that way.

32:28.080 --> 32:31.959
- No, that way.
- Two kilometres...

32:32.120 --> 32:36.159
Well you should have checked your compass
before you smashed it.

32:36.320 --> 32:39.551
West is in that direction
and I can prove it.

32:39.720 --> 32:44.475
- Your scarf is of silk?
- Of course it is.

32:44.640 --> 32:46.949
May I borrow it?

32:54.000 --> 32:57.549
Permission to cross the border?

33:02.600 --> 33:06.229
The silk makes the needle magnetic.

33:13.280 --> 33:17.398
Well Lieutenant you were right.
Nice little compass.

33:17.560 --> 33:21.235
Basic knowledge in the German Luftwaffe

34:35.440 --> 34:37.873
I need to take a piss.

34:39.639 --> 34:41.835
Oh come on! Where would I run to?

34:46.920 --> 34:50.389
You're not gonna win this war mate.

34:58.280 --> 35:02.990
What the fuck kind of sausages do you eat?
Anti-freeze?

35:08.480 --> 35:12.359
You win the pissing contest, Dunk.
Congratulations.

35:27.840 --> 35:31.150
Strunk? Strunk?

35:32.960 --> 35:36.919
2 o'clock. It's your turn.

35:44.720 --> 35:46.278
No!

35:46.440 --> 35:48.078
No! No.

35:50.120 --> 35:53.271
- Josef...
- No!

35:54.800 --> 35:58.156
I dreamt the British have eaten me.
They laughed as they ate me.

35:58.320 --> 36:00.834
- They are sleeping.
- I don't trust them Lieutenant.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.992
You don't need to
We are armed.

36:04.160 --> 36:07.391
We bomb British ships and
shoot British ariplanes.

36:07.560 --> 36:12.953
- Why can't we just shoot them both?
- They are useful as hostages.

36:21.120 --> 36:23.873
Lieutenant?

36:24.800 --> 36:27.030
Where's your pistol?

36:28.520 --> 36:30.988
In my hand.

37:07.560 --> 37:11.439
Time to get up.
We leave in half an hour.

37:26.280 --> 37:30.319
We'd rather stay here
if you don't mind.

37:41.200 --> 37:43.589
Do you need a mirror?

37:44.760 --> 37:46.796
Why not?

37:50.360 --> 37:53.352
But I take the razor after.

37:55.600 --> 37:58.160
We're somewhere here.

37:58.320 --> 38:02.154
We will go up this way. Across the mountain.

38:02.320 --> 38:06.996
Have you seen the weather?
For God's sake man this is untamed wilderness.

38:07.160 --> 38:12.632
We're out of food and there's hardly any wood left.

38:12.800 --> 38:16.873
- We leave now
- Lieutenant. I have a suggestion.

38:17.040 --> 38:19.474
- Why don't we go our separate ways.
- No.

38:19.640 --> 38:21.870
Why not?

38:22.040 --> 38:25.999
- There are rules of war.
- Yes why are you Germans so obsessed with rules and regulations?

38:26.160 --> 38:31.598
You will never understand. That is why Germany
is great and the British Empire is crumbling.

38:31.760 --> 38:36.436
- Crumbling? Nonsense, the Empire is doing fine.
- Fine? Wake up Captain!

38:46.240 --> 38:49.437
Come on! This way!

39:09.200 --> 39:11.919
Strunk, I cannot go on.

39:22.880 --> 39:25.394
Get up.

39:31.920 --> 39:34.195
Lieutenant!

39:44.720 --> 39:46.199
Lieutenant!

39:51.120 --> 39:52.758
Stop!

39:58.960 --> 40:01.076
Strunk!

40:02.520 --> 40:05.114
Lieutenant!

40:07.800 --> 40:09.597
Follow the trail.

40:09.760 --> 40:12.274
Over here!

40:14.760 --> 40:17.479
We must go back!

40:19.760 --> 40:22.558
Go back to the cabin!

40:35.560 --> 40:38.438
Let's face it.

40:38.600 --> 40:41.068
We're all going to die here.

40:46.360 --> 40:49.830
Lieutenant, why didn't we turn around?

40:53.040 --> 40:55.076
I don't understand!

40:55.240 --> 40:58.516
- All the other airplanes have...
- That's enough airman!

40:58.680 --> 41:01.319
But we should have turned back. Why didn't we?

41:01.480 --> 41:05.075
We had an order.
A made a decision.

41:05.240 --> 41:08.277
- But...
- There's nothing more to say about it!

41:12.200 --> 41:15.033
How on Earth do you expect us to survive?

41:20.000 --> 41:24.073
We have the bed, supports,

41:24.240 --> 41:27.516
We can take it from the floor and the wall.

41:27.680 --> 41:30.433
You! Help him.

41:35.240 --> 41:37.800
I know what we can eat

41:50.840 --> 41:56.198
- We're seriously gonna eat moss?
- It's tasty and full of vitamins.

41:56.360 --> 42:00.911
Food rule nr. 1: If it's full of
vitamins it tastes like shit.

42:23.160 --> 42:25.469
It's good.

42:27.560 --> 42:30.393
Not bad.

42:30.560 --> 42:33.597
A steak would be nice.
We could try hunting.

42:33.760 --> 42:36.957
- You don't like youp either.
- I said the soup is okay you stupid sud (?)

42:37.120 --> 42:42.114
All I'm saying that it would be nice with a steak.
I suppose old Adolf is a vegeterian too.

42:42.280 --> 42:45.636
- I'm not a vegeterian!
- Then how come you're so skinny?
- Stop!

42:56.560 --> 43:00.997
So Smith are you really a champion dartplayer?

43:01.160 --> 43:04.596
- Two bloody days. (?)
- No he's not.

43:04.760 --> 43:09.356
Okay give me three bullets you stuffed
marching penguin and I'll prove it to you

43:33.600 --> 43:35.875
Stand up.

43:38.840 --> 43:41.354
Yes, do it Schwarz!

43:53.200 --> 43:55.794
Now point at one of Josef's buttons.

43:55.960 --> 43:59.157
- What?
- Point at one of Josef's buttons

44:02.080 --> 44:03.991
This one.

44:09.120 --> 44:11.270
Don't move.

44:22.400 --> 44:24.277
You were lucky..

44:24.440 --> 44:27.238
Don't move!

44:33.160 --> 44:36.038
You cannot do this three times.

44:42.760 --> 44:46.514
- You were right Lieutenant!
- You did that on purpose!

45:00.280 --> 45:03.397
You should have seen your face.

45:04.600 --> 45:08.229
Not to put too fine a word in it, but your soup has given me the runs.

45:08.400 --> 45:11.312
- What?
- Permission to shit?

45:17.280 --> 45:20.033
I neet to go to the toilet.

45:21.200 --> 45:24.317
- Very good, Smith.
- Thank you.

45:35.280 --> 45:37.919
Captain Davenport.

45:58.360 --> 46:01.113
Thank you.

46:13.480 --> 46:15.675
Reindeer.

46:17.560 --> 46:20.472
Reindeer.
Come and shoot them.

46:21.680 --> 46:25.229
Reindeer.
Reindeer! Come and shoot them!

46:31.120 --> 46:33.190
Fuck.

46:33.360 --> 46:35.191
Fucking Hell!

46:35.360 --> 46:39.911
Ten to fifteen reindeer
right in front of the fucking cabin!

46:43.720 --> 46:47.076
I know.
They've gone now. Fuck.

46:54.600 --> 46:56.909
Hey, Josef...

46:58.000 --> 47:02.039
I have to say.
Chapter two war a little rough on my arse.

47:03.040 --> 47:05.395
Bloody idiot you've done it now.

47:13.200 --> 47:15.236
I kill you.
.

47:15.400 --> 47:18.358
- Get out of the way!
- Josef! Give me your weapon.

47:18.520 --> 47:22.399
- Out of the way. Out of the way!
- I said weapon down.

47:22.560 --> 47:25.199
- You are dead..
- I strongly suggest you apologize, Smith.
- Apologize for what?

47:25.360 --> 47:29.239
You are not completely yourself.
Give me the weapon.

47:29.400 --> 47:32.278
- He has insulted the Fuhrer!
- You are a proud german airman!

47:34.280 --> 47:37.989
German Luftwaffe prides itself
on order and discipline.

47:38.160 --> 47:41.550
- Do not abandon that now corporal.
- Get out of the way!

47:41.720 --> 47:46.794
- You are dead!
- The Lieutenant your commanding
officer has given you an order.

47:48.920 --> 47:51.480
You need to obey it.

47:52.680 --> 47:57.435
Now listen to your commanding
officer and put down your gun.

48:02.400 --> 48:06.598
Do you really want to disobey your leader?

48:21.360 --> 48:25.399
I did not give you permission
to cross that line, Captain.

48:38.400 --> 48:40.550
Weapons on the floor!

48:42.840 --> 48:44.159
Now!

48:46.880 --> 48:48.916
And slide them over there!

48:56.960 --> 48:59.793
Nice work Smith.

48:59.960 --> 49:02.679
Right. You, over there.

49:08.960 --> 49:11.713
Are you taking us prisoners?

49:12.880 --> 49:16.714
- That's right.
- Well in that case according to the
Geneva Convention we are entitled to...

49:16.880 --> 49:19.553
- I know, I know.
- Yes you know.

49:19.720 --> 49:23.793
But do you also acceppt it as your responsibility?

49:27.400 --> 49:31.359
Right. It's time to change places.

49:31.520 --> 49:36.389
- Please consider Josef's condition.
- He'll be fine over there.

49:40.880 --> 49:42.836
Allright leave him be.

49:43.000 --> 49:46.629
Have Strunk carry all the would-be weapons
over to out side.

49:46.800 --> 49:48.279
Now.

49:48.440 --> 49:49.839
Do it.

49:53.520 --> 49:55.988
And the axe.

50:25.240 --> 50:27.549
I've got a few questions.

50:27.720 --> 50:32.874
You already have taken most of Europe.
Not England but most of Europe.

50:33.040 --> 50:35.554
How does that feel?

50:40.000 --> 50:43.072
I don't know
I'm just a pilot.

50:43.240 --> 50:45.435
Think harder.

50:47.360 --> 50:50.477
- I feel sad.
- Than why did you do it?

50:50.640 --> 50:51.993
Orders.

50:52.160 --> 50:57.359
When do you think Hitler will be satisfied then?
When he's taken China?

50:57.520 --> 51:00.273
- Maybe.
- What the fuck does he want with China?

51:00.440 --> 51:04.558
- They speak Chinese over there for Christ's sake!
- I guess you're right.

51:04.720 --> 51:10.272
One last question: What makes you think
you have the right to invade everyone?

51:10.440 --> 51:14.399
- Maybe we are just kile you.
- I'm sorry you've lost me there.

51:14.560 --> 51:18.030
- England invaded the whole world exactly the same way.
- We did not!

51:18.200 --> 51:21.670
What about India?
What about all your colonies?

51:21.840 --> 51:26.755
You sailed away with a gun and a Bible in
your hand and took whatever you wanted!

51:26.920 --> 51:29.150
- That is the whole reason we're here.
- You're over your head mate!

51:29.320 --> 51:34.348
- Am I? We are here to protect the Norwegians from you.
- What?

51:34.520 --> 51:37.432
You want the land and more importantly
you want what is in it.

51:37.600 --> 51:43.232
- What the fuck would we want with this place?
- You don't know? Raw materials.

51:43.400 --> 51:47.678
Raw materials for your industry.
Your ships, your planes, your bombs.

51:47.840 --> 51:50.229
That is why we both are here.

51:51.640 --> 51:55.792
History, Robert.
We all want raw materials.

53:22.320 --> 53:25.517
There's nothing to eat.

53:25.680 --> 53:28.752
What will you do about it?

53:29.320 --> 53:32.039
We'll get some more moss.

53:33.920 --> 53:38.357
I'll go out and shoot a norwegian reindeer.
Satisfied?

53:38.520 --> 53:41.193
- Take Strunk with you.
- Why?

53:41.360 --> 53:43.476
Because that's an order.

53:44.040 --> 53:47.476
Get up Skunk. Get up.

53:48.240 --> 53:51.915
Here. You'll need an extra gun for hunting.

54:23.680 --> 54:26.558
Take this one too.

54:31.240 --> 54:35.631
- I don't think that's a goo idea.
- I didn't ask what you think. Just do it.

54:42.240 --> 54:44.834
This is where the reindeer were

54:46.760 --> 54:48.830
I told you.

55:01.680 --> 55:03.875
Go on.

55:10.200 --> 55:12.589
Axe please.

55:20.720 --> 55:23.314
Excellent.

55:38.560 --> 55:40.357
Help me!

55:48.120 --> 55:50.190
Excellent?

55:50.360 --> 55:53.955
- I told you.
- Spare me your notable remarks.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.036
What are you doing?

55:59.720 --> 56:04.589
- Not a very sporty gesture.
- This is war, not a silly game in your country club.

56:04.760 --> 56:06.716
Keep it for all i care, just help me here!

56:18.280 --> 56:23.149
Tell me why is it so damned important
for you to be in control all the time?

56:24.760 --> 56:28.912
Because that's how it is.
Am I right?

56:29.080 --> 56:30.991
Why?

56:31.160 --> 56:33.754
Look at me!

56:35.880 --> 56:37.757
Look at me!

57:26.840 --> 57:29.752
Nice shooting.

57:30.880 --> 57:33.997
- Did you just speak?
- Yes.

57:34.160 --> 57:37.357
Why the hell didn't you
say anything before then?

57:37.520 --> 57:40.751
You never say anything interesting.

57:47.320 --> 57:50.517
What the Devil is the matter with you?

57:55.920 --> 57:59.515
- I'm a failure.
- Nonsense. Keep pushing.

57:59.680 --> 58:01.432
Yes I am.

58:02.560 --> 58:06.109
- What on Earth are you talking about?
- I'm a lousy pilot.

58:06.280 --> 58:11.115
- Well I'm an excellent pilot and you shot me down.
- On my first flight I made a plane crash.

58:11.280 --> 58:13.350
Three people died.

58:13.520 --> 58:15.988
I was sent three months in prison.

58:16.160 --> 58:19.869
But when the war broke out
they gave me a new chance.

58:20.040 --> 58:24.079
On the next flight I
crashed into a hangar.

58:24.240 --> 58:28.597
I lost a man on this trip,

58:28.760 --> 58:30.557
and look at Josef.

58:35.800 --> 58:38.553
Please don't.

58:41.040 --> 58:43.474
I'm sorry.

58:51.720 --> 58:56.555
How come you have volunteered Strunk?
I mean you're almos forty.

58:56.720 --> 59:00.713
- You earned a lot of money. You didn't have to.
- It was my duty.

59:00.880 --> 59:03.030
Oh come on!

59:05.040 --> 59:08.828
Would you like to run a
company with 2000 men?

59:09.000 --> 59:13.232
Paperwork, responsibility
and long hours?

59:13.400 --> 59:18.394
- No fucking way.
- Me neither. So I volunteered.

59:26.320 --> 59:29.357
And then you met me.

59:29.520 --> 59:31.033
Get going.

59:31.480 --> 59:35.473
Strunk! The beam!

59:36.400 --> 59:38.311
Do something!

59:49.880 --> 59:51.791
Yes.

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:11.113
- Put the gun down!
- You put the gun down!

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:15.432
- How did he get it?
- It's a little complicated.

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:18.797
I'm willing to lower my gun
if you do the same.

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:21.793
And end up in a german prison camp? No, fucking thank you!

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:25.839
- Do it Smith.
- We need to work together.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.595
We forget the guns, make a cease-fire and...

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:33.309
and live like one big happy family?

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:35.755
Trust me on this one Smith.

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:51.473
Right. On three.

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:56.472
One. Two.

01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:00.110
Three.

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:11.672
- Well that's it.
- Yes. When you've dropped your second gun.

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:16.394
Do it Smith.

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:24.119
Right. That's that.

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:38.759
We have to skin her don't we?

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:46.553
Sir you've gone hunting back home.

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:50.234
Yes but we have people to take care of this kind of thing.

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:55.034
But what do you think they do?

01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:07.035
Get me a knife.

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:17.634
Oh come on! It can't be that hard.

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:25.835
What?

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.873
First we take the head off.

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:55.598
- You like cooking?
- I've never tried it before.

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.117
Never?

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:00.633
No.

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:04.190
You never helped your mother?

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:07.670
Actually she never cooked either.

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.516
But it feels good.

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:40.633
Do you smell it?

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:11.792
It's gangrene I'm afraid.

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:16.830
Are you sure?

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:21.829
I'm sorry.

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:31.949
God!

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:40.994
We must amputate his arm and get him to a hospital.

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:44.350
How do we do this?

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:54.196
With the axe.

01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:08.673
We need to heat water.
Take whatever you can use for wood.

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:13.550
The beds floor whatever.
Smith get some snow.

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:17.952
Then we disinfect the axe and then...

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:22.874
We must stop the blood.

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:37.989
- Can you help me with the jacket?
- Lieutenant! I have found something!

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:09.833
It's dried meat.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:15.233
- But why hide it there?
- To stop you germans from finding it.

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:19.873
Can we have a drink now?

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:24.195
Good idea.

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:28.156
Ready?

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.595
- Josef?
- Wake up!

01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:39.232
We found some schnaps and we have a drink competition with the British!
The one who empties the bottle first.

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:41.277
You must participate.

01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:43.396
Cheers Josef.

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:46.120
- Up Liverpool.
- Come on get it down you! More!

01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:50.239
We must win!
You have to drink more!

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:53.312
- Yes yes yes we're winning.
- Don't you drink?

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:03.512
- Come on Smith they're winning they're winning!
- Drink on the Fuhrer!

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:06.069
Drink for Germany!

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:11.950
<i>Germany anthem</i>
<i>Germany Germany</i>
<i>above everything</i>

01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:16.557
<i>above everything in the world</i>

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:21.996
<i>When, for protection and defence, it always</i>

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:26.438
<i>takes a brotherly stand together.</i>

01:08:22.279 --> 01:08:26.432
- Want me to do it?
- Thanks.

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:28.830
But no, thanks

01:08:38.439 --> 01:08:40.395
Did we win?

01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:49.272
Yes yes. Yes yes we won.

01:08:49.439 --> 01:08:54.912
- Everything's good.
- What are you doing?

01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:59.752
Do you mind?

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:38.515
What should we do with the arm?

01:09:44.319 --> 01:09:47.038
I don't know.

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:49.395
We get rid of it.

01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:54.951
We can't it belons to Josef.

01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:59.677
What would he want with it?

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.798
It's a bit of a pickle really.

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:11.714
We have to do something.

01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:21.189
We could wrap something around it and -

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:24.557
- bury it. Outside.

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.392
Yes.

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:30.235
We will bury the arm
and make a small ceremony.

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:36.910
Perhaps Josef would like to be present.

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:38.957
Yes.

01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:43.272
Maybe it's bet to... wait.

01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:48.639
Oh for fuck's sake.
Come here you.

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:03.077
Can we please have a drink now?

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:28.311
NORWEGIAN MILITARY CAMP AT STRYN

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:49.229
...the rest are in good shape.
OK let's talk tomorrow. Thank you.

01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:55.430
I came across a burned out German aircraft.

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:58.717
Here at Heilstuguvatn.

01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:02.918
So that's where they are.

01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:05.150
And the crew?

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:07.356
I don't know.

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:09.750
We must look for them tomorrow.

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:12.473
Your turn Smith.

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:15.029
Tell us -

01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:19.870
- how you impressed this lovely sheila.

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:24.391
- No way.
- Come on.

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:29.190
- Sheila.
- Sheila, Sheila, Sheila!

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:33.558
Allright! I showed her me cock and she fainted.

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:38.316
That often happens when you're
not used to wearing strong glasses.

01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:42.317
Come on Smith.

01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:45.790
Tell us.
How did you do it?

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:52.030
Okay. I sang to her.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.116
You sang?

01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:02.400
I got up on the bar and I sang to everyone.
And that did the trick.

01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:06.599
- And what did you sing?
- "Over the Rainbow".

01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:11.197
- I heard she liked the "Wizard of Oz".
- I'll be damned.

01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:13.351
And can we hear it?

01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:17.229
- No way.
- Come on.

01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:18.549
No.

01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:21.234
- You can't sing.
- Yes I can.

01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:24.153
- So come on. Sing!
- Sing!

01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:27.517
Sing! Sing!
Sing! Sing! Sing!

01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:31.150
I need to piss.
No contests this time please.

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:34.790
- Liar!
- Liar!

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:42.837
Here you are.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.797
Well I could...

01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:51.478
<i>Somewhere over the rainbow</i>

01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:55.519
<i>Way up high</i>

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:59.992
<i>There's a land that I heard of</i>

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:03.994
<i>Once in a lullaby.</i>

01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:10.714
<i>Somewhere over the rainbow</i>

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:15.116
<i>Skies are blue</i>

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:20.229
<i>And the dreams that you dare to dream</i>

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:23.278
<i>Really do come true.</i>

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.993
<i>Someday I'll wish upon a star</i>

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:32.678
<i>And wake up where the clouds are far</i>
<i>Behind me.</i>

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:35.559
<i>Where troubles melt like lemon drops</i>

01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:37.756
<i>Away above the chimney tops</i>

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:42.835
<i>That's where you'll find me.</i>

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:49.349
<i>Somewhere over the rainbow</i>

01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:53.115
<i>Bluebirds fly.</i>

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:58.516
<i>Birds fly over the rainbow.</i>

01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:03.470
<i>Why then, oh why can't I?</i>

01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:35.834
Bravo!

01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:43.873
And you Captain?
Do you have anything for us?

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:47.995
Actually I do.

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:51.948
And I have no hesitation in
saying it will completely -

01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:55.157
- outshine your
brilliant performances.

01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:57.436
So what is it?

01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:02.516
Close your eyes.

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:14.955
Now open your eyes.

01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:20.036
Where did these come from?

01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:23.590
Well actually I was saving them
till we saw the sea.

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:28.036
But now seems a more
appropriate moment.

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:31.556
I can see the sea through
these little tubes of delight.

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:33.358
What?

01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:37.399
I can see the sea through
these little tubes of delight.

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:48.199
MY BATTLE
ADOLF HITLER

01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:29.315
Gentlemen it's been
a pleasure and an honor.

01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:47.273
If you could do something else
what would that be?

01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:51.149
- Stupid question
- Why?

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:55.279
What if the company burned down
and your parents said to you:

01:17:55.440 --> 01:18:00.833
"Listen Stookey there's no future here.
Go do something else."

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:06.358
Why should I talk to you about this?
You are a man without principles.

01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:11.036
- I have lots of principles. Want to hear one?
- No

01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:14.875
Do whatever make syou happy.

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:17.838
What about responsibility?

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.436
What about the responsibility to be happy?

01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:27.040
Raise your left arm.

01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:31.791
You see? You always do what you're told.

01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:34.918
No one told me to volunteer for the army.
No one.

01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:39.756
But the only reason you did was
to get away from the family business.

01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:42.878
It was the choice of the less evil for you.

01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:48.192
So now I'm asking:

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:51.955
When will you do something
that makes you happy?

01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:56.077
Goodnight.

01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:08.957
What happened?

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:17.271
- It's gone?
- You had gangrene.

01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:21.479
- You would have died.
- It still hurts.

01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:24.154
Look at me!

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:27.517
You gave your arm for your Fuhrer!

01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:31.070
He would be proud of you.

01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:37.117
Here eat some chocolate.
We have plenty.

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:42.150
Shall we go home now?

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:45.596
Yes we're going home.

01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:33.470
I think you and Smith should leave now.

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:36.074
Are you sure?

01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:40.358
Josef is better but we will
only slow you down.

01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:45.436
- I have a suggestion.
- Yes Smith?

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:47.750
I climb the hill and look for a better way.

01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:52.914
You stay here and make some kind of sled
for Josef and then we'll all go.

01:21:55.600 --> 01:22:00.276
- Do you know how to ski Smith?
- I tried it once with my uncle when i was a nipper Sir.

01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:04.194
Ah an expert. Excellent.

01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:08.194
- I go with you.
- Good.

01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:38.872
It's wonderful here.

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:41.679
It certainly is.

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:47.999
One could stay here until the war is over.

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:51.749
Maybe you should.

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:56.392
But you'd probably miss home.

01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:06.948
My wife left me. A week ago.

01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:25.637
She just left me with my...

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:28.030
with my best friend.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.752
I'm sorry.

01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:35.912
I wanted to impress her and -

01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:38.275
- I went too far.

01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:41.273
And...

01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:44.829
Here we are.

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:54.038
She'll be back old man.

01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:58.749
They've just left Germany.

01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:05.597
So I suppose you're serious about staying here?

01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:11.998
We could put one pair of skis underneath.
With nails.

01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:14.799
What do you think?

01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:35.428
- Yes!
- Why did you say yes?

01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:38.717
- I won.
- You did not.

01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:53.951
- I always wanted to be a painter.
- Of course you have.

01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:56.350
Then go for it.

01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:01.557
- What about money?
- Go to Paris and paint the tourists.

01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:05.554
Get a cheap room and become a bohemian.
Girls like that.

01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:09.474
- There is a war on.
- Yes and no Trunk.

01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:15.589
- My father will be very dissapointed.
- Maybe not.

01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:18.228
You don't know my father.

01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:21.994
It seems he doesn't know you either.

01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:35.918
Beautiful.

01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:38.833
See it's easy if you go that way.

01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:41.357
Here's the plan Trunky.

01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:46.355
We'll go back, get the others,
then we'll walk slowly that way down the mountain.

01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:50.718
We look for signs. If we're in british territory
then you go further South.

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:53.155
- And the other way around.
- Good idea.

01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:58.438
I think we better go.
I'm starting to like you.

01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:05.032
Go? I'll show you what
downward ski is all about lazy.

01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:32.279
- Am I going too fast for you?
- Out of my way you sauerkraut!

01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:35.159
<i>Rule, Britannia...</i>

01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:06.432
Strunk?

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:08.591
Wake up!

01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:15.879
Stupid English.

01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:20.672
Strunk.

01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:26.113
Hands up!

01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:32.432
Don't shoot. I'm british.

01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:35.034
What? British?

01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:38.237
Search him.

01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:54.748
It's okey

01:27:57.040 --> 01:28:01.431
You're safe.
You're safe now.

01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:26.759
Stop!

01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:30.276
Hands in the air!
Drop you guns! Drop you guns!

01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:32.670
I'm a british Officer.

01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:03.395
No!

01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:05.994
Get up!

01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:21.194
Why?

01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:27.037
Someday I'll look up his family.
Got a few things to tell them.

01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:56.075
We have plenty to talk about
when we are down the mountain.

01:29:56.240 --> 01:29:58.834
Let's go.

01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:18.834
Gome on move!

01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:21.635
<i>So you shot each other down</i>
<i>on the 27th of april.</i>

01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:25.274
- Answer.
- Yes.

01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:29.672
And you and airgunner Smith slept in the plane.

01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:31.239
Yes.

01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:35.188
And the next day you arrived
at the same cabin as the germans.

01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:39.558
- Yes.
- Is it not a strange coincidance?

01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:40.994
Yes.

01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:49.237
And in the cabin they kept you as prisoners of war
because the yhad weapons and you had none.

01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:51.231
That's right.

01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:56.269
But you had a luger
and we found another one in the cabin.

01:31:56.440 --> 01:31:59.352
- Yes.
- So the one thing I don't undestand is why...

01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:02.429
Why didn't you shoot them?

01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:10.719
This information goes straight to the Norwegian Army
and from ther to your commanding officer.

01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:16.716
I'm not an expert, but the way I see it
they will think that you are traitors.

01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:19.633
Both of you.

01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:23.990
The Lieutenant would like to give back something.

01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:38.916
- You want something Lieutenant?
- Yes.

01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:45.389
- It belongs to Captain Davenport.
- It's just a lighter.

01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:51.199
- And now you want to return it?
- Yes.

01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:07.908
Why do you have his lighter?

01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:10.275
I took it from him.

01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:17.077
Was that all Lieutenant?

01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:23.955
- Yes.
- Come with me.

01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:31.957
Lieutenant Horst Schopis
tells the same story.

01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:34.509
They kept you es prisoners bla-bla-bla -

01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:37.752
- but you know something. I don't believe either of you.

01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:41.993
And if I find the slightest evidence
that you have been collaborating I'm coming after you and..

01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:44.993
Listen to me you twisted cheese eating gnome!

01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:47.799
While you've been sitting on your arse down here waiting -

01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:51.873
- for the sun to shine we've been struggling to survive!
In a remote cabin with some Germans!

01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:55.396
And we did survive! Most of us!

01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:59.155
And now I have my lighter back.

01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:02.392
And that is the end of the matter.

01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:06.469
Anything else?

01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:10.673
No.

01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:14.236
Good.

01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:22.753
Let's go Smith.

01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:41.636
Move!

01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:21.270
This way.

01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:40.272
Horst Schopis spent seven years
as a prisoner of war in Canada.

01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:45.718
A few days after returning to England -

01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:48.713
- Davenport and Smith
flew a mission over Trondheim.

01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:54.070
They were shot down again.

01:35:56.520 --> 01:36:00.718
Davenport was captured and spent
the rest of the war in a German prison camp.

01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:04.992
Smith died in the attack.

01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:10.679
Strunk is buried at the
war cemetery in Trondheim.

01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:16.671
Josef spent the rest of the war
in a prison camp in Canada.

01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:21.990
In 1977, Horst received a call
at his home in Munich.

01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:26.039
It was Davenport.

01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:30.591
He invited Horst to London.

01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:37.475
A little later the
two former enemies met.

01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:45.194
As friends.
