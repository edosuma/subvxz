Mm-hmm.

Shots came
from pretty low
to the ground.

14:41.844 --> 14:44.219

Shooter was
either crouching

extremely short.

to the conclusion

14:54.386 --> 14:57.427
that rival crime organizations
from Chechnya and Bolivia

led by these
two men, Goran Pazar
and Cristobal Sifuentes,

15:02.219 --> 15:05.386

by this man,

Taylor Garrett,
and his partner, the ringleader
of the entire operation,

15:09.886 --> 15:14.761
this man, Richard Krempf,
AKA Ryan Madison.

15:14.844 --> 15:17.511
While he posed as an actor
and a physical trainer,

15:17.594 --> 15:19.803
his primary occupation
was one of crime,

15:19.886 --> 15:21.969
violence, and greed.

Yes! Nice.

15:50.803 --> 15:54.511
that Mr. Garrett
and Mr. Madison acted alone.
