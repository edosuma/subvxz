00:28.035 --> 00:30.120
Whoo, yeah! Whoo!

00:30.370 --> 00:31.496
Well, that's about it.

00:31.747 --> 00:35.000
That's about it for this Independence
Day as the clock rocks 12:00,

00:35.250 --> 00:38.378
ladies and gentlemen, on July 5th, 1996.

00:38.587 --> 00:43.884
And you know, fellow Americans,
we are now 220 years old.

00:44.093 --> 00:46.095
We've just about, of course,
wiped out the ozone layer.

00:46.303 --> 00:50.307
Uh-huh, we live under
a continual first-stage smog alert,

00:50.516 --> 00:52.768
and there's a brand-new drug...
I don't know if you heard this by now.

00:52.976 --> 00:54.311
Check this out. You ready for this?

00:54.520 --> 00:56.522
There's a new drug out there
for the kids of America

00:56.730 --> 00:57.856
to bury themselves with.

00:58.107 --> 01:00.860
It's called Crystal Dream.
Can you believe it?

01:01.110 --> 01:03.487
Now listen to this.
You don't drink it. You don't smoke it.

01:03.695 --> 01:05.322
You don't snort it.
And you don't shoot it.

01:05.531 --> 01:08.034
What do you do? I know you're asking.
What do you do with this thing?

01:08.283 --> 01:10.452
Well, what you do
is you put it in your eyes,

01:10.661 --> 01:13.122
and apparently it tells you lies,
all right?

01:13.330 --> 01:16.583
I'll tell you, all this decadence, and we
still haven't nuked ourselves outta here.

01:16.792 --> 01:17.793
It's amazing.

01:18.001 --> 01:19.753
With a little luck
and a whole lot of hope,

01:19.962 --> 01:23.215
I think maybe the human race might live
to see another 220 years.

01:23.424 --> 01:24.842
And with that in mind...

01:25.050 --> 01:28.391
happy birthday, America!

02:07.301 --> 02:10.637
It's all the same

02:10.846 --> 02:13.766
Only the names will change

02:13.974 --> 02:15.934
Every day

02:16.143 --> 02:20.230
It seems we're wasting away

02:20.439 --> 02:23.442
Another place

02:23.650 --> 02:26.612
Where the faces are so cold

02:26.820 --> 02:29.531
I'd drive all night

02:29.740 --> 02:32.701
Just to get back home

02:32.910 --> 02:34.787
I'm a cowboy

02:36.246 --> 02:39.374
On a steel horse I ride

02:39.583 --> 02:41.210
I'm wanted

02:43.128 --> 02:46.131
Dead or alive

02:46.340 --> 02:47.841
I'm wanted

02:49.385 --> 02:52.137
Dead or alive

03:05.734 --> 03:07.319
Sometimes I sleep

03:08.862 --> 03:11.990
Sometimes it's not for days

03:12.199 --> 03:13.826
The people I meet

03:15.160 --> 03:18.372
Always go their separate ways

03:18.580 --> 03:21.333
Sometimes you tell the day

03:21.542 --> 03:24.711
By the bottle that you drink

03:24.920 --> 03:27.798
And times when you're alone

03:28.006 --> 03:30.843
Well, all you do is think

03:31.051 --> 03:33.137
I'm a cowboy

03:34.221 --> 03:37.182
On a steel horse I ride

03:37.391 --> 03:40.728
- I'm wanted
- Wanted

03:40.936 --> 03:44.022
Dead or alive

03:44.231 --> 03:47.359
- I'm wanted
- Wanted.

03:47.609 --> 03:54.908
Dead or alive

04:01.915 --> 04:05.878
Oh, I ride

04:28.859 --> 04:30.319
I'm a cowboy

04:32.112 --> 04:34.990
On a steel horse I ride

04:35.199 --> 04:38.368
- I'm wanted
- Wanted

04:38.577 --> 04:42.831
Dead or alive

04:43.040 --> 04:46.043
And I walk these streets

04:46.251 --> 04:48.879
A loaded six-string on my back

04:49.088 --> 04:51.215
I play for keeps...

04:53.050 --> 04:54.134
Give me the money!

04:54.343 --> 04:57.388
Open the register and give me
the fucking money now!

04:57.596 --> 04:59.473
Don't hurt her, son.

05:01.934 --> 05:07.147
Can I get, uh,
10 bucks on pump two, Suzie?

05:07.356 --> 05:10.317
- Hit the floor, asshole.
- Stay down!

05:14.071 --> 05:16.031
You know, this really pisses me off.

05:17.658 --> 05:22.037
Your store's got such nice,
clean, filtered fresh air and...

05:22.246 --> 05:26.458
it just takes a couple
of scumbags to stink it up.

05:26.667 --> 05:29.044
I said hit the floor, asshole,

05:29.294 --> 05:31.880
or I'm gonna blow your fucking head off!

05:33.048 --> 05:35.134
You know, if I had a nickel
for every time

05:35.342 --> 05:37.219
some piece of shit pointed a gun at me,

05:37.469 --> 05:39.471
I'd be a rich man.

05:43.684 --> 05:47.312
I'm gonna cut you long,
wide and deep, motor head.

06:03.328 --> 06:05.038
Pump all the gas you can hold.

06:05.247 --> 06:06.999
That's not good business.

06:08.792 --> 06:12.171
Hey, mister. Got a name?

06:13.589 --> 06:15.215
Harley.

06:15.424 --> 06:16.925
Harley Davidson.

06:50.084 --> 06:54.463
You know, my old man used to tell me,
before he left this shitty world,

06:55.589 --> 06:58.967
there's five rules
when shooting a game of pool for cash.

07:00.636 --> 07:02.846
Lesson number one.

07:03.055 --> 07:06.308
Always shoot with a cigarette
hanging in your mouth.

07:06.558 --> 07:09.186
Can't smoke with no fire, asshole.

07:10.854 --> 07:12.689
I quit.

07:14.942 --> 07:16.318
Lesson two.

07:17.653 --> 07:21.407
Always know the table before you shoot.

07:27.371 --> 07:29.248
Lesson number three.

07:29.498 --> 07:32.751
Make sure you chalk that stick

07:32.960 --> 07:35.921
real good before each shot.

07:41.385 --> 07:43.011
Lesson four.

07:43.262 --> 07:45.139
Never make a bet...

07:47.641 --> 07:49.643
if you can't pay the debt.

08:01.196 --> 08:02.573
Lesson number five.

08:05.951 --> 08:07.327
If you lose...

08:09.663 --> 08:11.665
stand up straight and tall...

08:15.377 --> 08:16.754
that corner...

08:17.004 --> 08:18.630
and walk like a man.

08:28.307 --> 08:30.809
I don't believe it. I don't believe it!

08:32.477 --> 08:33.979
What up, cowboy?

08:38.275 --> 08:40.527
School's out, boys.

08:46.116 --> 08:50.871
You better get the hell out of town,
cowboy, before my cord snaps.

08:51.080 --> 08:52.706
I'm good to go.

08:54.917 --> 08:57.669
Soon as I got five big bills
in my pocket.

08:57.878 --> 09:00.631
And your woman in my bed.

09:11.767 --> 09:15.020
Well, I ain't got no $500, cowboy.

09:16.063 --> 09:20.943
And there's no way in hell
you're bedding down my woman.

09:21.985 --> 09:26.615
My old man said there'd be blue-bellied,
chicken-shit bastards like you.

09:28.575 --> 09:32.329
You jumped on the wrong horse, cowboy.

09:32.538 --> 09:36.917
Just in case you didn't notice,
you're the only cowboy in this place.

09:38.794 --> 09:40.421
He ain't no cowboy.

09:40.671 --> 09:42.923
He's more like a pretty boy.

09:48.053 --> 09:49.304
Pretty boy.

09:58.063 --> 09:59.690
Hey, if he's such a pretty boy,

09:59.898 --> 10:02.672
you should be able
to handle him all by yourself.

10:09.700 --> 10:11.410
Together we stand

10:11.618 --> 10:13.954
- Divided we'll fall
- Son of a bitch.

10:15.664 --> 10:17.166
Pretty boy, huh?

10:17.374 --> 10:18.834
- Whoa!
- And work together...

10:31.513 --> 10:34.141
Well, now, when things go wrong,
as they sometimes will

10:36.143 --> 10:38.771
And the road you drive
is headed straight up a hill

10:39.021 --> 10:41.231
Let's work together...

10:43.317 --> 10:46.570
Let's work together

10:46.820 --> 10:51.658
Because together we will stand,
every boy, girl, woman, and man....

11:06.673 --> 11:08.801
Hey, Marlboro,

11:09.009 --> 11:11.595
when the hell are you gonna learn
to hustle guys you can hustle?

11:14.098 --> 11:16.350
You know, you gotta think things out.

11:17.851 --> 11:21.230
You think, Harley. I survive.

11:23.107 --> 11:25.859
Where the hell you been, anyway?

11:28.445 --> 11:30.697
Fixing bikes.

11:30.948 --> 11:33.575
Little shithole outside of Dallas.

11:33.784 --> 11:36.120
For two years?

11:36.328 --> 11:39.540
- I've been thinking.
- For two years?

11:39.748 --> 11:42.584
I've been thinking about life.

11:42.793 --> 11:44.920
That's the trouble with you, Harley.

11:47.464 --> 11:49.216
You think too damn much.

11:51.051 --> 11:54.430
Man, I hate this city,
but it's home, huh?

11:54.680 --> 11:59.184
It's that time again. Ain't it, Harley?

12:04.314 --> 12:07.067
Well, you're the only
family I got, Marlboro.

12:09.153 --> 12:11.530
God damn, that's a crying shame.

12:11.780 --> 12:15.367
You know, I could've had a family
with Jenny Ann,

12:15.576 --> 12:17.911
but marriage is for those other guys,
you know?

12:19.830 --> 12:21.081
Amen.

12:25.294 --> 12:27.921
Do you ever wonder...

12:28.130 --> 12:30.007
if there could be something better?

12:31.967 --> 12:33.927
Every day.

12:34.136 --> 12:36.138
No, I don't mean like that.
I mean something...

12:38.974 --> 12:40.976
Something different.

12:43.604 --> 12:45.355
Talking about heaven?

12:45.564 --> 12:47.274
I mean like...

12:47.483 --> 12:49.568
I mean like God.

12:49.777 --> 12:52.654
You didn't go and get religious
on me now, did you?

12:52.905 --> 12:55.783
No, man, but just think about it.

12:55.991 --> 12:57.576
If... if there is a...

12:57.785 --> 13:01.663
if there is a heaven and a God...

13:01.914 --> 13:04.041
hey, I'd like to meet the dude.

13:04.249 --> 13:06.877
You know, I'd like to go up there
and hang out with him.

13:12.257 --> 13:14.510
Well, you ain't gonna meet God with me.

13:17.137 --> 13:19.264
When I'm dead and done,

13:19.473 --> 13:22.351
I don't want no damn excuses
for what I did.

13:33.862 --> 13:35.572
Burbank.

13:35.781 --> 13:36.782
What happened?

13:39.910 --> 13:41.036
The future.

13:45.541 --> 13:47.251
You believe it?

13:47.459 --> 13:50.462
They turned Burbank
into a goddamn international airport.

13:55.759 --> 13:58.512
So come on, stop the world

13:58.721 --> 14:00.556
Stop the world

14:00.764 --> 14:03.392
'Cause this is where I get off

14:04.685 --> 14:08.710
- Well, you can all carry on
- Stop the world...

14:10.858 --> 14:12.067
Shit.

14:12.276 --> 14:13.736
Son of a bitch.

14:16.613 --> 14:18.907
You're a God damn mess, Marlboro.

14:19.158 --> 14:21.869
You need a new pair of boots
and a new bike.

14:22.077 --> 14:24.329
Lay off my boots.

14:24.538 --> 14:27.750
But you're right about
this rice-grinding horse.

14:27.958 --> 14:30.169
Shit. Piece of shit.

14:30.377 --> 14:32.963
I ought to give it a bullet
and put it out of its misery.

14:37.634 --> 14:39.261
God damn, Harley.

14:39.511 --> 14:42.473
If you were shooting for shit,
you wouldn't even get a whiff.

14:42.681 --> 14:44.558
Hey.

14:44.767 --> 14:46.268
Happy birthday.

14:52.024 --> 14:53.525
You son of a bitch.

14:54.777 --> 14:56.153
I almost forgot.

15:01.492 --> 15:03.619
.44 Mag Desert Eagle.

15:05.329 --> 15:08.540
Eight in the clip. One in the pipe.

15:10.834 --> 15:12.336
That's nice, man.

15:14.213 --> 15:17.424
- Thanks.
- How's it feel to be an old man?

15:21.095 --> 15:23.806
Older the bull, the stiffer the horn.

15:34.024 --> 15:37.403
You gotta squeeze the trigger, Harley.

15:38.862 --> 15:41.573
Don't yank it. It's not your dick.

15:41.782 --> 15:43.659
Squeeze it.

15:44.910 --> 15:48.872
All the tears inside

15:49.081 --> 15:53.335
What an ache it will bring...

15:53.544 --> 15:55.671
God, I love this place.

15:55.921 --> 15:58.048
And I will wander home

15:58.257 --> 16:01.385
To a telephone

16:01.593 --> 16:07.599
That forgot how to ring

16:07.850 --> 16:13.605
I could say you'll soon be back, dear

16:15.899 --> 16:21.155
To fool the whole town may be smart

16:23.157 --> 16:27.286
I'll tell them you'll soon be back, dear

16:29.037 --> 16:34.418
But what can I tell my heart?

16:34.626 --> 16:38.756
Hey, old man, half-time's over.
You got a restaurant to run.

16:38.964 --> 16:41.723
Man alive, Harley.

16:42.259 --> 16:43.969
So good to see you.

16:45.846 --> 16:48.932
And I'm gonna regret it. I always do.

16:50.893 --> 16:53.228
Yeah. Who are the suits?

16:55.481 --> 16:58.067
Go back to wherever
it is you ran off to.

16:59.234 --> 17:01.862
I can't do that.
I got some unfinished business.

17:03.864 --> 17:06.700
Some business is better left unfinished.

17:06.909 --> 17:10.119
...all the tears inside

17:10.329 --> 17:11.829
What an ache...

17:12.039 --> 17:13.415
Not this business.

17:13.624 --> 17:15.959
I'll see you around.

17:16.167 --> 17:19.922
Then I'll wander home

17:20.172 --> 17:23.925
To a telephone

17:24.175 --> 17:29.306
Oh, that forgot how to ring

17:29.515 --> 17:36.397
I could say you'll soon be back, dear

17:36.605 --> 17:37.981
Mmm

17:38.190 --> 17:42.778
To fool the whole town may be smart

17:42.986 --> 17:49.743
I could say you'll soon be back, dear

17:49.952 --> 17:51.412
Oh

17:51.620 --> 17:56.625
But what will I tell my heart?

17:56.875 --> 18:00.754
Oh, whoa, whoa...

18:01.004 --> 18:02.881
You got a death wish?

18:03.090 --> 18:06.677
Huh. Better leave
that one alone, Harley.

18:06.885 --> 18:09.388
Nah, you don't think Jack's
still pissed off, do you?

18:09.638 --> 18:11.265
Pissed off at ya?

18:11.473 --> 18:13.475
Nah.

18:13.684 --> 18:16.107
He wants to kill ya.

18:28.657 --> 18:32.035
Hey, what's happening, Jose?

18:32.286 --> 18:33.787
Look what the cat drug in.

18:35.372 --> 18:37.249
Hey, qué pasa, amigo?

18:38.500 --> 18:40.627
How you doing? Good to see you.

18:44.131 --> 18:46.592
He says didn't think
you were ever coming back.

18:46.800 --> 18:48.427
Chomping at the bit for some action.

18:48.635 --> 18:51.638
Hey, hey, man, me and you
are gonna rock and roll, brother.

18:51.889 --> 18:55.267
Jimmy and, uh, Jack here?

18:59.772 --> 19:03.984
Said he doesn't think you should go in.
If you do, you're dead.

19:04.193 --> 19:08.155
I knew that you were not alone...

19:08.363 --> 19:10.991
It's better to be dead and cool

19:11.241 --> 19:12.493
than alive and uncool.

19:12.743 --> 19:17.998
$100! What you got?!
What you got?! $200! $200!

19:18.248 --> 19:21.251
200 on Jack! Yeah! Place your bets!

19:21.502 --> 19:23.378
200 on Jack! 200 on Jack!

19:30.302 --> 19:32.513
Well, God damn.
Does he look like he's gotten bigger?

19:34.098 --> 19:35.349
Maybe a little.

19:35.599 --> 19:39.728
The book is closed!
It is time for the main event!

19:39.937 --> 19:41.188
Get set, gentlemen.

19:43.941 --> 19:46.902
Now I only ask one thing back here!

19:47.111 --> 19:51.615
And that is two things...
be fair and be cool.

19:51.865 --> 19:53.367
Wrestle!

19:53.575 --> 19:55.577
Come on, Jack! Come on, Jack!

19:55.786 --> 19:58.122
Come on, Jack! Come on, Jack!

19:58.330 --> 20:00.582
Jack, come on! Come on! Come on, Jack!

20:00.791 --> 20:05.045
Come on, Jack! Come on, Jack!
Jack, what are you doing?!

20:05.254 --> 20:07.589
Jack! What?! Jack!

20:08.709 --> 20:10.561
God damn it!

20:16.306 --> 20:18.767
God damn it, Harley,
what are you doing back here?

20:18.976 --> 20:20.477
I missed all you guys.

20:20.728 --> 20:22.479
I'm gonna kill you, Harley.

20:22.730 --> 20:24.481
- Told ya.
- Get ready.

20:24.690 --> 20:26.692
Hey, look, Jack,
I don't want to fight with you.

20:26.900 --> 20:29.027
- We're friends.
- Was friends.

20:29.236 --> 20:32.114
- Can't we talk this out?
- Not a chance.

20:32.322 --> 20:35.534
Talk's cheap. And I'm not buying any.

20:38.162 --> 20:40.414
Oh. Hey, Jimmy.

20:40.664 --> 20:42.166
You wanna help me out here a little?

20:42.374 --> 20:44.835
It's your world, homes.
I'm just living in it.

20:49.256 --> 20:51.133
Hurry up, Harley.

20:51.341 --> 20:53.469
It's gonna be bloody, but quick.

20:53.719 --> 20:55.220
You hold on.

21:01.101 --> 21:03.604
How much do you think we can get
for this jacket?

21:06.190 --> 21:07.524
What'd he say?

21:08.567 --> 21:10.569
Vaya con Dios, amigo.

21:11.987 --> 21:15.240
- What's that mean?
- "Go with God."

21:19.495 --> 21:23.248
Hey, now, Jack,
you know the last time we did this,

21:23.499 --> 21:24.750
I kicked your ass, Jack.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.586
Well, that was in high school, Harley.

21:27.795 --> 21:29.171
And Jack had a broken arm.

21:29.421 --> 21:32.007
Yeah, well, I'm the one that did it.

21:32.216 --> 21:33.675
You remember, Jack?

21:50.275 --> 21:51.735
God damn it.

21:53.946 --> 21:55.697
He was doing pretty good up to there.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.246
Oh...

22:03.288 --> 22:04.748
Ow! Ooh! Ooh!

22:04.957 --> 22:06.542
- Ow!
- I can't watch this.

22:13.882 --> 22:15.259
Uh-oh, he's fucked.

22:19.221 --> 22:22.307
I'm gonna kill you, Harley!

22:31.859 --> 22:34.611
I just picked the wrong flower.

22:34.820 --> 22:38.949
I'd kill for you, Harley.
How could you do that to me?

22:39.158 --> 22:43.620
Hey, I've always been bad company
with a good-looking woman in the room.

22:43.829 --> 22:46.165
Stay away from her, Harley.

22:46.373 --> 22:47.374
I love her.

22:47.624 --> 22:49.334
We're married.

22:51.420 --> 22:54.506
It's always only been you, Jack.

22:54.715 --> 22:56.800
She loves you.

22:57.009 --> 22:58.135
She does, huh?

22:58.385 --> 23:00.721
- Just you.
- Never you?

23:00.929 --> 23:03.307
Ah, no. Just you.

23:03.515 --> 23:05.100
Sorry, buddy.

23:05.309 --> 23:06.560
Sorry.

23:06.810 --> 23:09.063
Should've never let you
in the door, Harley.

23:11.065 --> 23:12.274
Yeah, thanks, man.

23:12.483 --> 23:14.610
Never. Never.

23:14.860 --> 23:18.363
- Never.
- Sorry.

23:18.614 --> 23:20.949
God damn it, Jack!

23:21.158 --> 23:23.410
I mean, you're my brother-in-law,
and I love you,

23:23.660 --> 23:26.914
but that don't get back
the couple of grand we lost tonight.

23:27.894 --> 23:30.417
The deal is you lose,

23:30.626 --> 23:33.378
and don't tear his fucking arm off.

23:33.587 --> 23:35.839
The old man and I have enough problems.

23:36.090 --> 23:39.593
We're just trying to make as much money
as we can before we lose this place.

23:39.802 --> 23:44.431
What do you mean "lose this place"?
You ain't gonna lose this place.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.141
It's a landmark.

23:46.350 --> 23:48.185
Don't mean shit, homes.

23:48.394 --> 23:51.230
If money talks and bullshit walks,
we walking.

23:51.438 --> 23:53.565
And it ain't gonna be
down easy street either.

23:53.774 --> 23:55.025
What's the story, old man?

23:55.234 --> 23:58.362
In '56, I leased this property

23:58.570 --> 24:02.658
when nobody wanted to be seen
on this side of the hill.

24:02.866 --> 24:04.993
And in '66...

24:05.244 --> 24:08.956
I renewed my lease on my own terms.

24:10.332 --> 24:12.709
350 a month for 30 years.

24:14.336 --> 24:17.589
In 21 days, those 30 years have run out.

24:17.840 --> 24:21.093
And now with the whole world
flying into Burbank,

24:21.301 --> 24:24.888
they're trying to strong-arm us
for $2.5 million

24:25.097 --> 24:26.724
for a five-year lease.

24:28.767 --> 24:30.894
They're gonna put up another skyscraper.

24:36.108 --> 24:38.193
Who's trying to strong-arm you?

24:38.402 --> 24:39.528
The bank.

24:42.072 --> 24:43.574
What bank?

24:43.824 --> 24:45.659
Great Trust.

24:49.788 --> 24:51.039
Oh, the suits?

24:51.290 --> 24:52.750
Mm-hmm.

24:55.252 --> 24:57.129
Well...

24:57.337 --> 25:02.342
there's only one place
to get that kind of money so fast.

25:02.593 --> 25:05.220
No suit's gonna loan us $2.5 million.

25:05.471 --> 25:06.597
That's for sure.

25:06.847 --> 25:09.475
Hey, man, I ain't talking about no loan.

25:13.103 --> 25:14.480
I don't wanna hear it, Harley.

25:14.730 --> 25:16.356
Hear what?

25:16.565 --> 25:17.900
You don't wanna know.

25:18.108 --> 25:19.485
Know what?

25:19.693 --> 25:22.446
He's gonna say we should rob the bank.

25:22.654 --> 25:25.157
We ain't gonna rob any damn bank.

25:25.407 --> 25:27.034
We ain't bank robbers.

25:27.242 --> 25:29.328
We owe it to the old man.

25:29.536 --> 25:31.163
We grew up in this place.

25:31.413 --> 25:33.624
You boys don't owe me anything.

25:33.832 --> 25:36.418
Sure, we do.

25:36.627 --> 25:40.380
Hell, if it wasn't for you,
we'd all be face-down in the gutter

25:40.589 --> 25:43.050
with a cigarette for company and a...

25:44.385 --> 25:46.136
a needle for good times.

25:50.724 --> 25:53.227
I'm ready to go.

25:53.435 --> 25:56.313
- Okay baby, in a minute.
- Now!

26:01.819 --> 26:04.446
Count me out of this one.

26:04.696 --> 26:06.657
I made a promise to Lulu.

26:08.909 --> 26:11.161
Yeah, you've made me
a lot of promises, Jack.

26:11.412 --> 26:14.123
We're gonna have a baby someday.

26:14.331 --> 26:16.792
Can't start a family from behind bars.

26:22.339 --> 26:23.465
You know...

26:25.008 --> 26:26.760
I really love this place.

26:26.969 --> 26:29.221
It's home.

26:29.471 --> 26:30.848
Makes me feel good.

26:31.098 --> 26:35.978
And if we gotta rob a bank to save it...

26:36.228 --> 26:38.939
I'll do that.

26:39.148 --> 26:41.275
But I can't do it alone.

26:41.483 --> 26:44.737
You guys are gonna
have to get it up, too.

27:54.807 --> 27:56.183
12 minutes, Pacific and California.

27:56.433 --> 27:58.310
We'll check with you then. Over.

27:58.519 --> 27:59.770
Roger, Dispatch.

28:04.983 --> 28:06.193
We copy.

28:10.531 --> 28:11.782
Whoa, shit!

28:56.577 --> 28:58.454
Car 3, car 3, this is Dispatch.

28:58.704 --> 29:01.290
Give me your 10-20
and security code, over.

29:01.498 --> 29:03.125
Dispatch, we're at the shipyard.

29:07.629 --> 29:10.132
What's with this hard hat?

29:22.311 --> 29:24.688
You're gonna have to move your
equipment. I got a delivery to make.

29:26.857 --> 29:29.735
What, are re you fucking deaf?
I said you're gonna have to move your...

29:29.985 --> 29:31.361
I heard what you said.

29:33.947 --> 29:35.407
Drop your gun.

29:35.616 --> 29:37.868
You're not gonna like
what you're getting into, pal.

29:38.118 --> 29:41.997
Hey, friend, from 15 feet away,
there's a chance you could miss me.

29:42.247 --> 29:44.500
I could be blind as a bat
and still blow your head off.

29:44.708 --> 29:47.294
- So you drop it.
- No, you drop it, asshole.

29:50.172 --> 29:51.799
- Shit!
- Think fast.

29:58.013 --> 29:59.348
Shit.

30:00.557 --> 30:03.185
Come on. Get over here. Sit down.

30:06.063 --> 30:09.024
Guns are made to be shot, Harley,
not thrown.

30:09.233 --> 30:11.068
Go do it, Jose.

30:12.319 --> 30:14.279
You're about the deadest shot
I've ever seen.

30:14.488 --> 30:15.948
Where'd you learn to do that?

30:16.156 --> 30:18.534
Read a book. Came with the gun.

30:18.742 --> 30:20.119
Who are you guys?

30:20.369 --> 30:22.496
Well, he's Harley Davidson.

30:22.746 --> 30:25.124
And I'm the Marlboro man.

30:25.374 --> 30:27.709
You look like a bunch
of two-bit hoods to me.

30:35.342 --> 30:37.594
Now does that look like the work
of two-bit hoods?

30:37.845 --> 30:40.681
Yeah. Pros would have used my keys.

30:43.100 --> 30:44.935
Well, he likes to blow things up.

30:45.144 --> 30:46.979
Hot stuff. Watch it.

30:47.187 --> 30:48.939
Nice day for work, huh, Jimmy?

30:49.189 --> 30:51.567
Ha, none better ever.
None better ever, homes.

31:00.492 --> 31:02.619
Nice doing business with you boys.

31:02.828 --> 31:05.581
Your business isn't with us.
It's with them.

31:26.393 --> 31:28.604
Well, whatever they've got to say,
I don't wanna hear it.

31:31.482 --> 31:32.608
Let's rock it! We got company.

31:32.858 --> 31:33.942
Shit, no.

31:43.535 --> 31:45.037
What the fuck is all this about?!

31:52.711 --> 31:54.838
Hey, Harley, why don't you
throw that shotgun at 'em?

31:55.047 --> 31:56.298
Maybe you'll hit something.

32:04.890 --> 32:07.393
- I thought you was a dead shot.
- So did I.

32:07.601 --> 32:09.728
Then why the fuck ain't they dropping?

32:09.978 --> 32:11.730
Beats the shit outta me.

32:36.505 --> 32:37.589
Come on, guys!

32:48.934 --> 32:50.811
- Come on, Harley.
- Let's go, Jimmy!

33:24.720 --> 33:26.847
Yee-ha!

33:27.097 --> 33:29.349
All right, you're a big
fucking hero, big man!

33:29.600 --> 33:31.060
A big fucking hero!

33:31.268 --> 33:32.519
You guys needed backup!

33:32.770 --> 33:34.396
I had nothing to do
and no one to do it with.

33:34.605 --> 33:35.814
Shit, backup, hell.

33:36.023 --> 33:39.276
Old Harley's thinking here
damn near had us on the ropes.

33:39.526 --> 33:41.236
Saved our lives, big boy.

33:41.445 --> 33:44.448
You guys owe me a bike.
I gotta get a new bike.

33:44.698 --> 33:46.533
Hey, man, you'll get a new bike.

33:46.742 --> 33:48.744
Promise me you won't tell Lulu.

33:48.952 --> 33:51.580
I don't want her getting mad.
She's mean when she's mad.

33:51.789 --> 33:55.167
Hey, look, I can take care of the bike,
but I can't take care of the bitch.

33:55.417 --> 33:57.169
Why not? You did once.

33:57.419 --> 33:59.546
You boy might wanna
take a look at this shit.

34:05.886 --> 34:06.970
What is it?

34:07.179 --> 34:09.014
Un-melted pure Crystal Dream.

34:09.223 --> 34:12.184
Well, what the fuck is that,
and what the fuck is it doing here?

34:12.393 --> 34:15.145
It's a drug, and I don't know
what the fuck it's doing here.

34:16.938 --> 34:18.524
I'm a son of a bitch.

34:18.732 --> 34:20.192
We jumped the wrong train.

34:20.400 --> 34:21.527
Oh, fuck!

34:21.735 --> 34:22.820
Shit, man.

34:23.027 --> 34:27.408
His little brother OD'ed
using this shit.

34:27.616 --> 34:30.953
Don't worry, Hose,
we ain't drug dealers.

34:33.789 --> 34:36.500
This is not a walk in the park, Harley.

34:36.708 --> 34:38.085
This is way fucking
out there on the edge.

34:38.335 --> 34:39.920
These guys aren't street dealers
dealing grass and pills.

34:40.129 --> 34:41.130
They're killers.

34:41.338 --> 34:42.672
They killed their own men
trying to waste us.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.007
That's enough, Jimmy.

34:44.257 --> 34:48.137
Never liked this plan from the start.

34:48.387 --> 34:50.097
But you needed help, and you took it.

34:50.304 --> 34:52.808
So don't whine about it now.

34:53.058 --> 34:57.062
What's done is done.
There ain't no turning back.

34:59.898 --> 35:01.024
Who are these men?

35:01.233 --> 35:05.612
Judging from their ability and data
we gathered, they're dilettantes.

35:05.863 --> 35:10.367
Details would suggest that they were
not aware of the cargo they've stolen.

35:19.918 --> 35:24.631
If they're amateurs,
how'd they destroy two vehicles...

35:24.840 --> 35:28.552
and then manage
to get away with the goods?

35:28.761 --> 35:32.222
- Hmm?
- They were extremely lucky.

35:34.224 --> 35:36.226
Mm.

35:36.477 --> 35:41.440
I don't have time for luck, now do I?

35:41.648 --> 35:43.650
Get back what's mine.

35:45.360 --> 35:48.113
And kill these men, Alexander, okay?

35:50.115 --> 35:52.493
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, babe.

35:55.370 --> 35:57.956
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

35:58.165 --> 35:59.792
Whoo...

36:04.922 --> 36:07.800
Oh, man, we really fucked up big.

36:10.761 --> 36:13.138
Marlboro, how the fuck
was I supposed to know

36:13.389 --> 36:16.975
somebody's using a bank
as a front to run drugs?

36:17.184 --> 36:21.021
Harley, I'm tired and I'm pissed.

36:22.648 --> 36:24.608
And I'd just like to unwind.

36:26.443 --> 36:28.445
So stop thinking.

36:28.695 --> 36:32.199
Oh, fuck, man, now I gotta think
of some way to make things right.

36:35.869 --> 36:38.330
- Hi.
- Hey.

36:38.539 --> 36:42.000
I know you don't know me,
but I don't have a way home,

36:42.209 --> 36:44.795
and Jimmy said
that you'd give me a ride.

36:46.839 --> 36:49.174
Sure, I'll give you a ride, Sally.

36:49.383 --> 36:53.887
Oh, the name tag's wrong.
My real name's Honey.

36:55.222 --> 36:59.226
Pure gold and sweet.

37:01.228 --> 37:02.813
I'm off at 10:00.

37:05.733 --> 37:10.362
Well, my old man used to tell me,
before he left this shitty world,

37:10.612 --> 37:12.990
the right woman can make you,
and the wrong one can break you.

37:13.240 --> 37:15.576
You know, I woke up one morning...

37:18.996 --> 37:20.247
and she was gone.

37:22.916 --> 37:26.420
No note. No kiss goodbye. No nothing.

37:26.670 --> 37:29.173
And I still have feelings
for her deep inside.

37:31.425 --> 37:33.177
Well, partner...

37:33.427 --> 37:38.682
I only know of two cures
for that particular ailment.

37:38.932 --> 37:42.770
And since you don't drink anymore,
you're down to one.

37:45.189 --> 37:46.690
Let me borrow your bike.

37:47.900 --> 37:49.401
I gotta take Sally home.

37:49.651 --> 37:51.111
Get a cab.

39:06.145 --> 39:08.522
Stand up and put your hands
behind your head.

39:11.984 --> 39:14.737
Ah, hell, I was just blowing off
a little steam.

39:14.945 --> 39:16.822
Yeah? Well, You blew in the wrong place.

39:17.030 --> 39:18.866
Now kiss the wall and spread 'em.

39:39.511 --> 39:42.347
Okay, cowboy, let's blow off some steam.

39:47.644 --> 39:48.896
What's wrong tonight?

39:51.774 --> 39:53.108
I'm getting married.

39:56.028 --> 39:58.781
God damn you, Robert,
I'm tired of waiting around

39:58.989 --> 40:01.366
for you to come by
when you feel the need.

40:01.617 --> 40:02.618
I get lonely.

40:02.868 --> 40:04.995
I like to share my bed
with someone at night.

40:12.211 --> 40:14.088
Hell, isn't that what we're doing?

40:16.507 --> 40:19.009
One, maybe two nights a month,
if I'm lucky.

40:20.469 --> 40:22.971
Well, I am what I am, Virginia.

40:23.180 --> 40:28.018
I've accepted that, even loved it.
But I don't have to like it.

40:30.646 --> 40:33.524
I get scared for you. I worry.

40:33.732 --> 40:35.234
You could spend the rest of your life

40:35.484 --> 40:38.237
looking for whatever the hell
it is you're looking for,

40:38.487 --> 40:41.240
but someday you're gonna
have to find yourself.

40:41.490 --> 40:43.992
I just can't wait
for you to do it anymore.

40:48.539 --> 40:50.040
I love you, Robert.

40:52.751 --> 40:55.212
But after tonight,
you're not welcome here anymore.

41:19.486 --> 41:22.197
With your long black hair

41:22.406 --> 41:25.784
Fallin' down your face

41:25.993 --> 41:28.245
Red lips and lethal pout

41:28.454 --> 41:30.914
Send me to heaven

41:33.000 --> 41:36.128
Seein' is believin'

41:36.336 --> 41:39.089
Baby, you're so strange...

41:39.339 --> 41:40.591
Oh, fuck.

41:43.052 --> 41:44.553
That's for Marlboro.

41:44.803 --> 41:46.555
Me and you'll go out
and have something to eat.

41:48.182 --> 41:49.933
You're a bad man, Harley.

41:53.729 --> 41:55.481
What are you two up to this time?

41:59.651 --> 42:04.406
Do you know anything
about this new drug, Crystal Dream?

42:05.824 --> 42:09.453
It's 100% addictive and kills
one out of every seven users.

42:09.703 --> 42:11.205
Don't mess with it, Harley.

42:11.455 --> 42:13.457
I don't mess with drugs no more,
you know that.

42:17.711 --> 42:20.547
It's a liquid-based blue crystalline
substance

42:20.756 --> 42:24.718
with a neurotoxin RAH...
retina-activating hallucinogen.

42:24.927 --> 42:30.557
Hmm, so it sort of numbs the senses
and makes the world look better?

42:30.808 --> 42:32.309
Yeah, that's the high.

42:32.518 --> 42:36.480
The low is it damages the central nervous
system, causes insanity and then death.

42:36.730 --> 42:38.565
On the street it's called "The Dream."

42:38.774 --> 42:40.484
Thank you.

42:48.033 --> 42:49.243
Hey, I'm broke.

43:04.633 --> 43:09.530
You know something, Harley?
In a weird way I'm jealous of you two.

43:12.474 --> 43:14.059
But why's that?

43:14.268 --> 43:18.147
The rest of us work
so damn hard at life, and...

43:18.397 --> 43:20.274
you guys just live it one day at a time.

43:20.482 --> 43:24.987
Yeah.

43:25.237 --> 43:26.488
See ya.

43:48.469 --> 43:51.221
Hey, what's with you and them boots?

43:51.430 --> 43:56.935
Lay off my boots, Harley.
I'm in no fucking mood.

43:57.186 --> 43:59.938
Did you have a rough night?

44:00.189 --> 44:02.775
Woke up smelling the coffee.
Gimme a light.

44:02.983 --> 44:04.568
Hey, I thought you quit.

44:04.777 --> 44:06.028
Just give me a light.

44:17.498 --> 44:18.707
Whose bike?

44:18.916 --> 44:20.125
Probably hers.

44:21.543 --> 44:23.295
She ain't got no Harley.

44:29.343 --> 44:31.095
Hey, man, what're you doing?

44:31.303 --> 44:35.432
It ain't hers, but I'll bet
I know whose it is.

44:35.641 --> 44:36.850
Whose?

44:37.059 --> 44:38.435
His.

44:40.312 --> 44:42.689
You gotta cross and cut
the red and the green wire.

44:42.898 --> 44:44.733
I know how to hot-wire a bike, Harley.

44:44.942 --> 44:48.570
Don't tell me how to hot-wire
a God damn bike.

44:51.865 --> 44:53.575
You gotta turn on the gas.

45:01.500 --> 45:05.337
If he's gonna take my girl,
I'm gonna take his bike.

45:24.690 --> 45:26.442
You sure this is the right bank?

45:26.650 --> 45:28.402
Yeah, I'm sure.

45:28.652 --> 45:29.778
How sure?

45:30.028 --> 45:32.489
Hey, man, I'm real sure.

45:32.698 --> 45:35.159
Yeah, well, you were real sure
there was gonna be money

45:35.367 --> 45:37.369
on that armored truck.

45:37.619 --> 45:40.456
You were real sure
this plan was gonna work.

45:40.664 --> 45:43.000
You better be right about this,
or I'm for real sure

45:43.208 --> 45:45.544
gonna break your head
so you can't think no more.

45:45.753 --> 45:47.254
Hey, man, why don't you lighten up?

45:47.504 --> 45:49.882
Tell me about that guy
that's working Virginia.

45:50.090 --> 45:51.967
Don't care. Didn't ask.

45:54.303 --> 45:57.181
You mean you're gonna let her go
just like that?

45:57.431 --> 45:59.141
From where I stand, she let me go.

45:59.349 --> 46:02.478
Well, you know, if she wants you
to chase her, that's the game.

46:02.686 --> 46:06.023
My old man used to tell me,
before he left this shitty world,

46:06.231 --> 46:08.358
never chase buses or women.

46:08.609 --> 46:10.736
You always get left behind.

46:26.752 --> 46:28.712
I assume you're here to do business?

46:28.921 --> 46:33.258
Well... I'd like to do some business
with you some other time.

46:33.467 --> 46:35.844
But right now we got to talk
to the man upstairs.

46:36.095 --> 46:37.971
Stay on my tail.

46:43.227 --> 46:44.353
No problem.

46:58.158 --> 47:01.662
Well, looks like we really
rattled the cage, Marlboro.

47:09.336 --> 47:11.713
You know this ain't gonna fly.

47:11.964 --> 47:13.340
I'll bet you it flies.

47:15.634 --> 47:19.513
- How much?
- I'll bet you a dollar.

47:19.722 --> 47:21.849
But if you win, you're gonna have
to give me some credit

47:22.057 --> 47:24.518
'cause that cab fare last night
broke me.

47:27.938 --> 47:29.231
If I win, we're dead.

47:33.444 --> 47:35.946
Well, strap on your seat belt
and get ready to fly.

47:38.782 --> 47:40.409
American Airlines.

47:40.659 --> 47:43.036
You've got something of mine.

47:43.245 --> 47:44.455
And I want it back.

47:44.663 --> 47:47.416
Oh, really? What is that?

47:47.666 --> 47:49.626
You know something?

47:49.835 --> 47:53.589
You've got balls. Big ones.

47:53.797 --> 47:56.550
But they're not as big
as you might think.

47:56.800 --> 48:01.847
Well, mister, my balls are big enough
to get your attention.

48:11.273 --> 48:12.566
What do you want?

48:12.816 --> 48:15.819
Oh, how's about two and a half
million dollars?

48:16.070 --> 48:20.449
Nah, wait a minute. Check that.
I got a little side bet going.

48:20.657 --> 48:24.036
Make that two and a half
million dollars plus a buck.

48:24.286 --> 48:27.790
When? Where?

48:27.998 --> 48:30.375
Airplane graveyard.

48:32.127 --> 48:34.713
Late. Tonight.

48:36.340 --> 48:38.217
Well, I'll tell you what,
you better call your boys off

48:38.425 --> 48:40.761
or you ain't gonna get nothing.

48:40.969 --> 48:44.476
Yeah. Talk to you
on the rebound... asshole.

48:51.522 --> 48:53.273
Yes, sir?

48:53.482 --> 48:56.485
Let 'em go, Alexander.

48:56.693 --> 48:58.028
Let 'em go.

49:19.675 --> 49:20.759
Okay, let's do it.

49:44.074 --> 49:46.076
Your boys are good...

49:46.326 --> 49:47.911
for dilettantes.

49:48.120 --> 49:50.956
They're not my boys. They're my friends.

49:51.165 --> 49:53.542
Yeah. Let's see the crystals.

49:53.751 --> 49:56.336
Let's see the cash.

49:56.545 --> 50:00.048
Hey. Open it real slow, huh?

50:10.684 --> 50:12.644
Why the extra dollar?

50:12.853 --> 50:14.104
We had a bet.

50:17.107 --> 50:18.275
Okay.

50:39.421 --> 50:43.402
Well, wasn't a walk in the park,
but the job's done.

50:50.432 --> 50:53.560
You did it. You did it, man.

50:53.769 --> 50:55.270
Check this out, old man.

50:58.607 --> 51:01.985
Besides Jimmy and Lulu
and the rest of you,

51:02.194 --> 51:05.531
this place is what keeps me
coming back day after day.

51:05.739 --> 51:08.242
Thank you for giving that back to me.

51:10.661 --> 51:12.037
I've got things to do.

51:12.287 --> 51:14.164
Tomorrow we open for good.

51:14.373 --> 51:17.298
All right. All right, Pops.

51:18.710 --> 51:21.672
Oh, man, I am thankful for this.

51:21.880 --> 51:24.716
But you boys are whacked out,
you know that?

51:24.925 --> 51:27.219
I'm talking about you, Harley.

51:29.722 --> 51:31.473
Hey, man,
that's what friendship's about.

51:31.682 --> 51:35.060
It's done, and it's done good.
So let's take the edge off.

51:35.310 --> 51:37.271
Come here, Marlboro, get in this.

51:37.479 --> 51:40.983
To Lulu, who'd kill me
if she knew what I helped do.

51:41.191 --> 51:43.610
But because I did it,
she still has a job.

51:43.861 --> 51:45.195
To Lulu.

51:58.125 --> 51:59.752
What's wrong, man? We done good tonight.

52:00.002 --> 52:03.881
Shit, Harley,
we're way out of our league, man.

52:05.507 --> 52:07.009
It was too easy.

52:08.343 --> 52:10.179
I think we oughta get
the fuck out of Dodge,

52:10.387 --> 52:12.389
let things cool off for a while.

52:12.598 --> 52:14.975
Aw, look at this shit.

52:23.150 --> 52:25.152
How the fuck did they find us?

52:25.402 --> 52:26.820
I don't know.

52:27.071 --> 52:29.907
I damn sure don't wanna find out.

52:33.994 --> 52:35.996
Not this again.

52:36.205 --> 52:38.582
I can't deal with this again, Harley.

52:38.791 --> 52:43.045
The old man has got it under control.

52:43.295 --> 52:49.176
Yeah, tell them we were in, but we left.

52:49.426 --> 52:50.928
That's right. That's right, boy.

52:51.136 --> 52:53.514
Take your pussy friends,
get the hell out of here.

52:53.722 --> 52:55.891
Oops.

52:56.141 --> 52:57.226
I don't think he liked that.

52:57.434 --> 53:00.312
I don't give a flying fuck
what he likes.

53:37.850 --> 53:39.601
We gotta get the hell outta here!

53:39.810 --> 53:41.061
No kidding.

54:04.835 --> 54:08.213
I'm gonna fucking die today, Harley,
and I blame you.

54:09.214 --> 54:12.259
No, we're gonna live, man, and we're
gonna go through that window to do it.

54:15.429 --> 54:17.181
Jack, cover me.

54:31.445 --> 54:32.446
Jack, come on!

54:36.658 --> 54:38.285
I'm right behind you!

54:45.250 --> 54:46.293
Jack?!

54:49.004 --> 54:50.255
Jack!

56:20.220 --> 56:21.597
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

56:27.936 --> 56:30.064
Lady? Lady, hey, hey, hey.

56:30.272 --> 56:32.232
Take it easy. We don't wanna hurt you.

56:36.862 --> 56:38.238
Take her.

56:47.331 --> 56:48.832
"Take her" he says.

56:50.959 --> 56:52.669
Jesus, lady!

56:58.258 --> 57:00.844
Hey, hey, hey!
This is a restricted area, man.

57:01.845 --> 57:02.846
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

57:03.055 --> 57:04.598
You're gonna have to scoot. I mean fast.

57:07.726 --> 57:09.603
Hey, chump, in case
you don't hear so good,

57:09.853 --> 57:11.480
I said get the fuck outta here!

58:02.406 --> 58:04.491
I hate this fucking town.

58:04.700 --> 58:08.454
Hey, man, you don't know
anything about this city.

58:08.704 --> 58:11.081
I grew up here, you dumb bastard.

58:13.083 --> 58:14.835
I didn't know that.

58:15.043 --> 58:17.045
Yeah, well,
what you don't know is a lot.

58:20.007 --> 58:22.760
You mean to tell me that real cowboys,

58:23.010 --> 58:27.723
I mean, shit-kickin‘ rodeo cowboys,
come from Vegas?

58:30.100 --> 58:31.518
Some of the best.

58:33.353 --> 58:35.105
Maybe even one of the best.

58:45.074 --> 58:47.076
Hey, man,
I know you don't wanna be here.

58:48.202 --> 58:52.539
We're just gonna stay long enough
to clean up and get some sleep.

58:52.748 --> 58:54.958
Yeah, okay.

58:55.167 --> 58:57.586
Did I ever tell you the time
I lost my cherry

58:57.836 --> 59:00.839
to a fat girl in a room just like this?

59:01.090 --> 59:02.883
It was in Mesquite, Texas.

59:03.133 --> 59:04.385
Her name was Annie.

59:06.136 --> 59:09.098
Wasn't too good putting us
up on this top floor like this.

59:09.306 --> 59:12.017
There was a convention in town.
It was all we could get.

59:13.936 --> 59:15.562
Makes for a tough getaway.

59:17.398 --> 59:19.274
Look, partner,
they're not gonna find us here.

59:19.525 --> 59:22.152
- They can't.
- I wouldn't bet on that.

59:26.198 --> 59:30.327
Why don't you stop whining, you know?
You're starting to sound like Jimmy.

59:41.505 --> 59:43.507
Jimmy's dead,
you heartless piece of shit.

59:51.598 --> 59:53.892
Four of our friends got killed tonight.

59:55.769 --> 59:57.521
They're gone.

59:57.771 --> 59:59.523
Fucking tagged-on-the-toe dead.

01:00:01.108 --> 01:00:02.443
Does that matter to you?

01:00:04.153 --> 01:00:05.654
I mean, do you fucking care?

01:00:08.073 --> 01:00:10.200
Hey, Marlboro,
I didn't force anyone to do it.

01:00:11.744 --> 01:00:15.122
They took the chance,
and they knew the risk.

01:00:17.374 --> 01:00:20.002
All right, hey, look, it's my fault.

01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:21.754
And I gotta live with it.

01:00:23.505 --> 01:00:27.009
But right now me and you gotta
pull it together if we're gonna survive.

01:00:48.363 --> 01:00:49.865
Hello?

01:00:50.074 --> 01:00:51.200
Hello.

01:00:51.408 --> 01:00:52.785
Hey.

01:00:53.035 --> 01:00:55.537
Where are you? Are you all right?

01:00:55.746 --> 01:00:57.122
Las Vegas.

01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:02.252
I called because I'm drunk,
and I'm tired.

01:01:02.461 --> 01:01:04.755
I just wanted to hear your voice.

01:01:05.005 --> 01:01:07.966
Tell me exactly where you are
and what you've done.

01:01:08.488 --> 01:01:10.448
- No.
- And I can help.

01:01:11.470 --> 01:01:13.722
No. Can't do that.

01:01:17.893 --> 01:01:20.312
I've already dug too many graves.

01:01:20.562 --> 01:01:22.064
None of them my own.

01:01:22.314 --> 01:01:24.191
Robert...

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:28.404
you keep running, and sooner or later,
you're gonna end up like your dad.

01:01:28.654 --> 01:01:31.907
Drunk, dead and alone,
and all you can do is hold on and wait.

01:01:41.708 --> 01:01:43.460
Robert?

01:01:43.669 --> 01:01:46.171
Hello? Are you there?

01:01:48.424 --> 01:01:51.176
Harley, let's go. We got company.

01:01:51.385 --> 01:01:54.513
- Hey, I know how they found us.
- Yeah? Well, Tell me later.

01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:03.188
Please, God, let us get out of this one.

01:02:03.439 --> 01:02:05.566
I promise I'll change.

01:02:05.774 --> 01:02:07.651
That's bullshit, Harley.

01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:09.799
I'll fucking try.

01:02:13.407 --> 01:02:14.450
Shit.

01:02:19.037 --> 01:02:20.581
Up! They're going up!

01:02:48.776 --> 01:02:50.527
Holy shit.

01:02:52.196 --> 01:02:53.322
Come on!

01:03:08.962 --> 01:03:12.341
We're at death's door, Harley,
and the devil's a-knocking.

01:03:12.591 --> 01:03:16.345
So you better think up of something fast
or start your ass praying for real.

01:03:29.983 --> 01:03:33.153
Put your gun away. We're gonna jump.

01:03:45.541 --> 01:03:47.918
Are you out of your fucking mind?

01:03:49.586 --> 01:03:51.338
You got a better idea?

01:04:03.934 --> 01:04:07.563
Well, whatever the hell they're
wearing's made outta die-hard bluesteel.

01:04:09.273 --> 01:04:11.150
All right, come on, take my hand, man.

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:12.401
No!

01:04:12.651 --> 01:04:14.528
- It's the only way, man.
- I don't care.

01:04:14.737 --> 01:04:15.738
Well, I'm gonna do it.

01:04:15.946 --> 01:04:17.322
Do it!

01:04:17.573 --> 01:04:19.116
You're gonna get shot up here.

01:04:19.366 --> 01:04:20.993
You're gonna get smashed down there.

01:04:21.201 --> 01:04:22.578
Hey, man, I'd rather
be smashed than shot.

01:04:22.786 --> 01:04:23.912
Not me.

01:04:25.706 --> 01:04:26.707
All right. Fuck you!

01:04:26.915 --> 01:04:29.543
You stay up here,
and you get shot and die!

01:04:29.752 --> 01:04:30.878
I owe you that.

01:04:46.268 --> 01:04:51.273
I hate you for this, Harley.
I fucking hate you for this.

01:04:51.523 --> 01:04:55.652
I hate you, Harley!

01:04:55.861 --> 01:04:57.112
Oh, shit!

01:05:01.492 --> 01:05:03.786
Was that fucking intense or what?

01:05:31.563 --> 01:05:33.440
We gotta go back, Harley.

01:05:35.359 --> 01:05:37.861
What the fuck you talking about?

01:05:40.072 --> 01:05:41.740
We survived. It's over.

01:05:45.494 --> 01:05:46.495
It ain't over.

01:05:46.703 --> 01:05:49.832
Hey, man, it's definitely over.

01:05:50.082 --> 01:05:51.250
See this?

01:05:54.086 --> 01:05:55.587
It's out of commission.

01:05:55.796 --> 01:05:59.800
That means that them fuckers can't
keep coming out of nowhere anymore.

01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:06.014
We still got a bunch of money
we didn't get for ourselves,

01:06:06.265 --> 01:06:08.892
and a bar full of dead friends in L.A.

01:06:11.353 --> 01:06:12.354
It ain't over.

01:06:14.481 --> 01:06:15.733
This ain't right.

01:06:17.359 --> 01:06:19.611
And we owe it to our friends
to make it right.

01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:24.158
Hey, man, I ain't making any plans
for you and me for a long time.

01:06:24.366 --> 01:06:27.911
We came out alive. We came out ahead,

01:06:28.162 --> 01:06:29.455
I ain't doing it.

01:06:29.705 --> 01:06:33.959
God damn it, Harley. We ain't ahead.

01:06:34.168 --> 01:06:39.047
And if being alive means
living on the run, then I don't want it.

01:06:39.298 --> 01:06:43.927
Marlboro, you do
what you think is right, right?

01:06:44.178 --> 01:06:45.929
I'm gonna stay alive.

01:06:55.189 --> 01:06:57.941
Better to be dead and cool...

01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:59.651
than alive and uncool.

01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:27.679
Midnight

01:07:29.473 --> 01:07:31.392
Streetlight

01:07:34.228 --> 01:07:35.854
Shadows

01:07:37.564 --> 01:07:40.317
At your feet...

01:07:40.567 --> 01:07:41.944
What do you want?

01:07:43.821 --> 01:07:45.197
Virginia.

01:07:45.406 --> 01:07:46.698
She's asleep.

01:07:46.949 --> 01:07:48.450
Wake her up.

01:07:48.659 --> 01:07:50.828
Why the fuck is here here?!

01:07:51.745 --> 01:07:53.997
Though I want you so...

01:07:54.206 --> 01:07:55.499
- Just calm down.
- I am calm!

01:07:55.749 --> 01:07:59.128
To stay

01:07:59.336 --> 01:08:03.257
I'm standing on the hard line

01:08:03.507 --> 01:08:07.636
Taking my sweet time...

01:08:07.845 --> 01:08:11.223
You've got until we reach the sidewalk
to say what you've got to say.

01:08:13.809 --> 01:08:16.687
Mr. Trigger-happy a cop too?

01:08:16.895 --> 01:08:18.397
He just made lieutenant.

01:08:23.193 --> 01:08:24.486
He the guy?

01:08:25.612 --> 01:08:27.322
What do you want, Robert?

01:08:28.991 --> 01:08:31.118
You want my help? My sympathy?

01:08:31.368 --> 01:08:32.911
My hand in marriage? What?

01:08:40.085 --> 01:08:41.712
I don't know what I want.

01:08:43.505 --> 01:08:45.256
But I know what I don't want.

01:08:49.178 --> 01:08:52.555
I don't want whatever
there was between us...

01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:59.604
to end without telling you...

01:09:01.814 --> 01:09:05.819
you've been the better part of my life.
The best part of my life.

01:09:08.822 --> 01:09:12.242
I'm standing on the hard line...

01:09:14.118 --> 01:09:15.662
Goodbye, Virginia.

01:09:19.750 --> 01:09:20.876
Robert?

01:09:22.002 --> 01:09:24.505
I'm slow to change...

01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:30.676
Been fighting on the front line

01:09:30.886 --> 01:09:34.890
Victim of a heart crime

01:09:35.099 --> 01:09:39.978
Can't just let you steal my heart

01:09:40.229 --> 01:09:41.979
Away.

01:09:42.189 --> 01:09:45.567
Sorry I'm late.
I had a layover in Denver.

01:09:50.447 --> 01:09:51.990
Are you and me friends?

01:09:52.241 --> 01:09:54.493
Sure, we're friends.

01:09:54.701 --> 01:09:56.954
Then how come,

01:09:57.204 --> 01:10:00.082
with all the shit that me
and you have been through,

01:10:00.332 --> 01:10:03.085
I've asked you the same question
a thousand times

01:10:03.293 --> 01:10:05.295
and you ain't never answered me?

01:10:08.882 --> 01:10:10.634
What question?

01:10:10.843 --> 01:10:13.595
What's with you and those fucking boots?

01:10:15.055 --> 01:10:16.932
My old man gave me these boots

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:21.145
first time I rode
in a professional rodeo.

01:10:23.605 --> 01:10:26.608
It was the first and last thing
he ever gave me.

01:10:26.817 --> 01:10:31.029
Hey, Marlboro,
you could've told me that.

01:10:31.238 --> 01:10:34.366
Just kind of figured
it was between him and me.

01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:39.663
I got throwed and busted
my arm in four places.

01:10:39.913 --> 01:10:43.041
Hey, I think you should do it again.

01:10:45.753 --> 01:10:48.380
Someday. Maybe.

01:10:57.973 --> 01:10:59.975
The hell'd you get that hog leg?

01:11:00.225 --> 01:11:01.351
Denver.

01:11:02.895 --> 01:11:07.399
This is a Ruger Super Blackhawk.

01:11:07.608 --> 01:11:09.985
454 conversion.

01:11:12.946 --> 01:11:15.449
God damn, Harley,
that's too much gun for you.

01:11:15.657 --> 01:11:17.534
This is what I learned with.

01:11:18.827 --> 01:11:22.164
Nobody learns with a converted 454.

01:11:22.372 --> 01:11:23.916
I did.

01:11:27.336 --> 01:11:28.462
That explains it.

01:11:30.964 --> 01:11:34.259
I've been through
a lot of shit in my life.

01:11:34.510 --> 01:11:37.638
But up until about three weeks ago,

01:11:37.846 --> 01:11:41.475
the only God damn thing
I ever shot at was tin cans.

01:11:43.769 --> 01:11:47.272
You know, I never wanted
to shoot at nobody in anger.

01:11:47.481 --> 01:11:51.527
And I sure as shit
ain't never wanted to kill nobody.

01:11:53.112 --> 01:11:54.238
Me, neither.

01:12:16.552 --> 01:12:21.181
Take up a heading of zero one zero.
They're seven clicks northeast of here.

01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:24.393
Sounds like the same heading
my co-pilot shouted out

01:12:24.643 --> 01:12:26.770
the day we choppered into Khe Sanh.

01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:29.273
Last thing the ugly bastard ever said.

01:12:29.481 --> 01:12:31.483
Shut the fuck up and fly, Tom.

01:12:31.734 --> 01:12:35.279
Okay. Okay.

01:14:48.912 --> 01:14:53.041
Well, God, if you do exist
and you're up there watching

01:14:53.250 --> 01:14:57.045
from wherever it is
you're watching from...

01:14:57.296 --> 01:14:58.714
just look away for a minute.

01:14:58.964 --> 01:15:02.468
Remember, these bastards
are bulletproof.

01:15:02.676 --> 01:15:05.804
So aim for their heads, dead center.

01:15:06.055 --> 01:15:10.184
You might wanna hold
onto that cannon with both hands.

01:15:10.434 --> 01:15:12.561
Don't yank.

01:15:12.770 --> 01:15:14.772
Don't pull.

01:15:15.022 --> 01:15:16.065
Squeeze.

01:15:16.315 --> 01:15:18.067
You ready?

01:15:18.317 --> 01:15:20.736
Let's rock and roll these motherfuckers.

01:15:20.986 --> 01:15:22.613
Let's make things right.

01:15:45.177 --> 01:15:48.931
You know, that gun costs about two bucks
every time you fire it.

01:15:49.181 --> 01:15:50.808
That's two bucks a bullet.

01:15:52.726 --> 01:15:54.353
Well, how many did I hit?

01:15:55.938 --> 01:15:58.690
You spent 12 bucks
and didn't hit a God damn thing.

01:15:58.941 --> 01:16:01.318
I nailed one,
and it cost four and a quarter.

01:16:01.527 --> 01:16:02.569
Where'd they go?

01:16:04.405 --> 01:16:06.782
Right there,
and they're spending a fortune.

01:16:17.751 --> 01:16:19.420
We really pissed them off this time.

01:16:19.670 --> 01:16:21.797
No shit. Come on, let's go.

01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:20.647
Harley?

01:17:21.940 --> 01:17:23.192
Are you shooting?

01:17:26.695 --> 01:17:28.572
- Harley?
- What?!

01:18:37.182 --> 01:18:40.686
That's two for me.
You better get off your ass, Harley.

01:18:40.894 --> 01:18:43.522
Hey, give me a fucking break.
God knows I'm trying.

01:18:43.731 --> 01:18:47.151
You better ask God for some help.
We ain't done yet.

01:19:30.027 --> 01:19:31.945
Fuck! Shit! Piss!

01:19:32.196 --> 01:19:33.864
Horseshit in a bear's ass!

01:19:43.415 --> 01:19:44.541
Two bucks.

01:19:47.211 --> 01:19:48.337
That's four.

01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:51.548
Six.

01:20:03.769 --> 01:20:04.937
12.

01:20:53.277 --> 01:20:54.778
You're gonna die today.

01:20:55.028 --> 01:20:58.407
If you wanna make it fast,
tell me where the money is.

01:20:58.657 --> 01:21:01.910
If you wanna make it slow, don't.

01:21:02.161 --> 01:21:03.662
It's your choice.

01:21:05.622 --> 01:21:08.375
It's a good day for dying.

01:21:08.625 --> 01:21:10.878
I'll do it slow.

01:21:16.258 --> 01:21:17.426
Hey, slick.

01:21:18.594 --> 01:21:19.845
Cut him loose.

01:21:20.095 --> 01:21:22.723
Oh, shit. I'm a dead man.

01:21:22.973 --> 01:21:24.475
Where is the money?

01:21:26.894 --> 01:21:28.187
Where is the money?

01:21:32.691 --> 01:21:37.112
Squeeze it, Harley. Just squeeze it.

01:21:42.493 --> 01:21:44.495
Agh!

01:21:44.745 --> 01:21:46.997
- Shit.
- Shit!

01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:52.169
That hurt, Harley. That hurt bad.

01:21:54.213 --> 01:21:57.591
Looks like your luck just ran out.

01:21:57.841 --> 01:21:59.343
Now, where is the money?

01:22:00.677 --> 01:22:02.179
Shoot him, God damn it!

01:22:04.014 --> 01:22:07.434
Keep shooting.
You'll make my job easier.

01:22:07.684 --> 01:22:11.814
Shoot the bastard!
Don't think, just shoot him!

01:22:12.064 --> 01:22:13.190
Shoot him!

01:22:43.262 --> 01:22:46.682
Well, that one's for you. How'd it feel?

01:22:46.932 --> 01:22:49.560
Best 12 bucks I ever spent.

01:22:50.394 --> 01:22:53.897
Agh... son of a bitch.

01:22:54.106 --> 01:22:56.233
How you feeling?

01:22:56.483 --> 01:22:58.235
Oh...

01:22:58.485 --> 01:23:00.738
Like I've been rode hard and put up wet.

01:23:02.072 --> 01:23:04.700
Well, shake it off. We got one more.

01:23:04.908 --> 01:23:06.160
Let's go.

01:23:16.628 --> 01:23:19.506
I can't believe
you fucking shot me, Harley.

01:23:22.718 --> 01:23:24.970
Dickhead, you fucking shot me.

01:23:27.681 --> 01:23:30.559
Can't believe you shot me,
you shit bird.

01:23:37.274 --> 01:23:40.694
I find it hard to believe
you greased those cue balls.

01:23:40.944 --> 01:23:43.489
But it's a good thing somebody did.

01:23:43.739 --> 01:23:45.407
Yeah? Why's that?

01:23:45.657 --> 01:23:47.659
They were pussies.

01:23:47.868 --> 01:23:52.915
Their clothes were made out of
that lightweight Japanese Kevlar.

01:24:14.353 --> 01:24:17.898
All right, pal,
this is your last paycheck.

01:24:18.148 --> 01:24:19.650
You work for us now.

01:24:38.710 --> 01:24:40.087
Here's what we'll do.

01:24:40.337 --> 01:24:44.133
As soon as I ask him to change
the lease and he says no,

01:24:44.383 --> 01:24:47.010
just shoot his ass dead.

01:24:47.219 --> 01:24:48.971
Why me?

01:24:49.179 --> 01:24:51.598
I'm all out of bullets.

01:24:58.063 --> 01:24:59.690
Yes, Howard, it's good
to hear from you, too.

01:24:59.898 --> 01:25:02.651
Now, uh, what do you want from me?
Spit it out.

01:25:04.319 --> 01:25:05.446
Uh-huh.

01:25:07.197 --> 01:25:09.074
Uh, listen, How... Howard,

01:25:09.324 --> 01:25:10.993
I'm not interested
in the third world, okay?

01:25:11.243 --> 01:25:13.746
There's too much can go the wrong way
and not much that can go our way.

01:25:13.996 --> 01:25:16.498
Now, we've had this discussion.
I don't want to have it again, okay?

01:25:16.749 --> 01:25:19.251
Listen, Howard, say hello to your wife.
You're married, aren't you?

01:25:26.008 --> 01:25:29.511
Looking for Chance Wilder. You him?

01:25:32.848 --> 01:25:34.224
That's right.

01:25:34.433 --> 01:25:37.186
Deal away, Harley.

01:25:37.394 --> 01:25:38.896
Well, here.

01:25:40.439 --> 01:25:42.941
This is yours. We took it.
Wasn't right of us.

01:25:44.401 --> 01:25:47.654
So now you can change the lease back
to the Rock 'N' Roll Bar and Grill.

01:25:49.406 --> 01:25:52.284
No handouts. No breaks.

01:25:52.493 --> 01:25:55.496
Just a fair deal,
that's all we're asking.

01:25:55.746 --> 01:25:58.749
You guys must be charmed...

01:25:58.999 --> 01:26:00.751
to have made it this far.

01:26:00.959 --> 01:26:02.878
Well, four of our friends are dead.

01:26:03.128 --> 01:26:06.173
No, we're not charmed.

01:26:06.423 --> 01:26:07.841
We're just pissed off.

01:26:08.092 --> 01:26:09.343
That's too bad.

01:26:09.551 --> 01:26:10.844
Oh!

01:26:11.095 --> 01:26:13.722
That's too bad.

01:26:13.972 --> 01:26:16.600
Sorry I pissed you off.

01:26:16.850 --> 01:26:19.103
Listen...

01:26:19.311 --> 01:26:21.355
the lease stands, okay?

01:26:21.605 --> 01:26:23.357
So that's the end of that story.

01:26:23.565 --> 01:26:26.610
So if you came here to kill me,
do it now.

01:26:26.860 --> 01:26:29.655
If not, get the fuck out of here.

01:26:29.905 --> 01:26:33.659
I don't have the time to play
with guys like you, okay?

01:26:33.867 --> 01:26:35.911
I'm very busy.

01:26:36.161 --> 01:26:37.913
Hey, this ain't a game.

01:26:38.163 --> 01:26:40.416
All business is a game
one way or another.

01:26:40.624 --> 01:26:42.668
Selling drugs ain't no game.

01:26:42.918 --> 01:26:44.920
It's not your average game, that's true.

01:26:45.170 --> 01:26:50.050
I make $500,000 a year to sit
in this office and run this bank, okay?

01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:55.723
I make another $50 million a year to sit
in the same office and run those drugs.

01:26:55.973 --> 01:26:58.475
Now, that's a big game,
and it's big-time.

01:26:58.684 --> 01:27:01.812
Well, game's over.
Go ahead and do it, Marlboro.

01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:19.371
What are you waiting for?

01:27:19.580 --> 01:27:21.707
Just kill him and let's get
the fuck out of here.

01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:28.505
I can't do it.

01:27:32.092 --> 01:27:33.719
It's not right.

01:27:33.969 --> 01:27:37.723
Hey, this scumbag killed four
of our friends just for laughs.

01:27:38.932 --> 01:27:40.184
Still doesn't make it right.

01:27:40.434 --> 01:27:42.352
What are you talking about?

01:27:45.022 --> 01:27:48.275
My old man used to tell me,
before he left this shitty world,

01:27:48.525 --> 01:27:50.569
never shoot an unarmed man.

01:27:50.819 --> 01:27:52.738
Marlboro, fuck your old man.
Your old man's dead.

01:27:52.988 --> 01:27:55.115
Leave my old man out of this, all right?

01:27:55.365 --> 01:27:59.119
All right. Here. Now he's armed.

01:27:59.369 --> 01:28:00.871
That gun's empty, Harley.

01:28:02.498 --> 01:28:03.749
So what?

01:28:03.999 --> 01:28:06.376
This piece of shit gives drugs to kids.

01:28:07.628 --> 01:28:08.629
Drop it!

01:28:20.182 --> 01:28:24.436
You guys, did you really think you were
just gonna walk in here and shoot me?

01:28:24.645 --> 01:28:26.397
You... you thought that, didn't you?

01:28:27.481 --> 01:28:28.732
That was the plan.

01:28:30.359 --> 01:28:31.360
Yeah, that was the plan.

01:28:32.618 --> 01:28:36.031
You guys... you guys
are a piece of work.

01:28:36.281 --> 01:28:38.659
You got an edge. And I like that.

01:28:38.909 --> 01:28:40.452
I do. I like that.

01:28:40.702 --> 01:28:42.496
It almost makes me sorry
that I have to kill you.

01:28:42.746 --> 01:28:44.248
But I... I do. Hmm.

01:28:44.456 --> 01:28:46.625
I do right now.

01:29:48.187 --> 01:29:50.439
What'd you do? Did you pay him?

01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:54.068
No, man, that was your money.

01:29:54.318 --> 01:29:56.820
You paid him. He did that for free.

01:29:59.865 --> 01:30:00.991
You guys.

01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:04.119
Like your buddy said, fuck your old man.

01:30:04.369 --> 01:30:06.246
He's dead, right? Fuck him.

01:30:06.455 --> 01:30:08.207
Let's see what you're made of, huh?

01:30:17.633 --> 01:30:18.801
Think fast!

01:30:50.749 --> 01:30:51.792
Harley!

01:30:58.173 --> 01:31:01.468
- Good timing.
- I told you to shoot the fuck.

01:31:20.738 --> 01:31:24.116
Hey, guns are made
to be shot, not thrown.

01:31:27.828 --> 01:31:29.955
I was just trying to even the odds.

01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:41.508
Where you going this time?

01:31:42.926 --> 01:31:44.428
Who says I'm going?

01:31:45.554 --> 01:31:48.182
You always do, Harley.

01:31:48.432 --> 01:31:50.100
It's that time.

01:31:51.185 --> 01:31:52.686
You wanna come with me?

01:31:56.899 --> 01:31:58.150
Can't.

01:32:00.110 --> 01:32:02.905
I shouldn't have asked.
You never say yes.

01:32:14.792 --> 01:32:17.044
- Get the hell outta here.

01:32:43.529 --> 01:32:45.906
Vaya con Dios, amigo.

01:32:47.783 --> 01:32:49.535
This is Robert Lee Edison,

01:32:49.743 --> 01:32:53.038
a third-generation cowboy
with his own brand of misery.

01:32:53.288 --> 01:32:57.042
He hails from Las Vegas, Nevada,
and hasn't seen the back of a bull's neck

01:32:57.292 --> 01:32:59.920
since he got off real hard
in the National Finals Rodeo

01:33:00.129 --> 01:33:01.505
seven years ago.

01:33:01.755 --> 01:33:04.299
Let's see what he gets done
on a bull called Hondo,

01:33:04.550 --> 01:33:07.344
the top bull of the Diamond S
rodeo company.

01:33:07.594 --> 01:33:10.973
Okay, big boy, let's make it a good one.

01:33:13.225 --> 01:33:14.476
Outside!

01:33:14.685 --> 01:33:17.730
Outside! Okay, cowboy.

01:33:21.358 --> 01:33:23.736
...and then you cry

01:33:23.986 --> 01:33:27.114
I said walk with me

01:33:27.364 --> 01:33:29.408
Talk to me

01:33:29.658 --> 01:33:31.535
Take my hand

01:33:31.785 --> 01:33:34.204
To the man

01:33:34.455 --> 01:33:36.331
All the sounds

01:33:36.582 --> 01:33:39.460
What we found

01:33:39.668 --> 01:33:41.545
It's you I found...

01:33:41.754 --> 01:33:44.757
Hey.

01:33:45.007 --> 01:33:48.761
- Where you heading?
- Nowhere special.

01:33:49.011 --> 01:33:53.390
Come on, I'll take you there.

01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:57.770
Girl, I know how you feel

01:33:57.978 --> 01:34:02.858
This thing called love

01:34:03.067 --> 01:34:05.235
So come on.

01:34:05.486 --> 01:34:07.613
Ride on

01:34:07.863 --> 01:34:09.239
Ride on

01:34:09.448 --> 01:34:11.992
Ride with me

01:34:12.242 --> 01:34:14.369
So come on

01:34:14.578 --> 01:34:16.246
Ride on

01:34:16.497 --> 01:34:18.248
Ride on

01:34:18.457 --> 01:34:20.959
Ride with me

01:34:24.963 --> 01:34:28.717
I'd give you anything you want

01:34:28.967 --> 01:34:31.887
Loving just your heart

01:34:33.806 --> 01:34:37.309
Would you love me if I were poor

01:34:38.477 --> 01:34:40.854
I'd love you more

01:34:41.105 --> 01:34:44.024
I said walk with me

01:34:44.274 --> 01:34:46.402
Talk to me

01:34:46.652 --> 01:34:48.695
Take my hand

01:34:48.946 --> 01:34:50.739
To the man

01:34:50.989 --> 01:34:52.866
All the sounds

01:34:53.075 --> 01:34:56.203
What we found

01:34:56.453 --> 01:34:58.747
It's you I found

01:35:01.083 --> 01:35:04.002
Baby, we got it made

01:35:05.212 --> 01:35:07.631
When times get hard

01:35:09.758 --> 01:35:12.886
Girl, I know how it feels

01:35:14.096 --> 01:35:16.223
It hurts to love

01:35:19.059 --> 01:35:20.811
So come on

01:35:21.061 --> 01:35:23.355
Ride on

01:35:23.605 --> 01:35:24.982
Ride on

01:35:25.232 --> 01:35:28.902
Ride with me, baby

01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:31.989
Ride on

01:35:32.239 --> 01:35:33.991
Ride on

01:35:34.199 --> 01:35:36.201
Ride with me

01:35:38.746 --> 01:35:40.873
Ride on

01:35:41.081 --> 01:35:42.708
Ride on

01:35:42.958 --> 01:35:44.960
Ride with me

01:35:51.633 --> 01:35:55.888
Ride with me, baby

01:35:56.096 --> 01:35:58.974
Ooh, whoa

01:35:59.224 --> 01:36:00.642
Yeah, yeah.

01:36:13.489 --> 01:36:15.616
I watch my TV screen

01:36:15.824 --> 01:36:18.327
Life flashing before me

01:36:19.870 --> 01:36:22.373
So tell me what does that mean?

01:36:22.623 --> 01:36:24.750
And why does it bore me?

01:36:26.752 --> 01:36:27.878
Come on

01:36:29.213 --> 01:36:31.215
Let me show you how to do it

01:36:36.595 --> 01:36:40.349
I hear the radio
and the songs that they play

01:36:40.557 --> 01:36:43.185
Makin' my stomach turn

01:36:43.394 --> 01:36:47.064
I just want to hear some rock 'n' roll

01:36:47.314 --> 01:36:49.817
I watch my radio burn

01:36:50.025 --> 01:36:51.652
Come on

01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:54.363
Let me show you how to do it

01:36:55.739 --> 01:36:58.492
Well, come on, yeah

01:36:58.742 --> 01:37:03.038
Let me show you how to do it

01:37:03.288 --> 01:37:06.041
Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right, yeah

01:37:30.816 --> 01:37:34.486
I see the plastic people
leading plastic lives

01:37:34.737 --> 01:37:37.781
Substitute child, disposable wife

01:37:38.031 --> 01:37:40.909
Follow your TV, it is your guide

01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:44.329
The family cries when the TV dies

01:37:44.580 --> 01:37:46.457
Come on

01:37:46.665 --> 01:37:48.584
Let me show you how to do it

01:37:50.127 --> 01:37:52.755
Well, come on, yeah

01:37:52.963 --> 01:37:55.215
Let me show you how to do it

01:37:56.717 --> 01:38:01.638
Well, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on

01:38:03.015 --> 01:38:06.143
Let me show you how to do it

01:38:06.393 --> 01:38:08.770
Whoa, oh, yeah.
