00:09.640 --> 00:12.713
YOU KNOW, I'M SICK AND TIRED
OF PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO
REACH ME WHENEVER THEY WANT.

00:12.713 --> 00:15.746

YES, I CARE. 'CAUSE IT CAN
DESTROY OUR PLANET.

03:29.940 --> 03:31.482
ALSO, SHE'S NOT MEXICAN.

03:31.482 --> 03:32.783
WHAT, BUT YOU'RE--

03:32.783 --> 03:33.414
NOT MEXICAN EITHER.

03:33.414 --> 03:37.448

THAT, NO I CAN'T EVER BE

03:55.936 --> 03:58.309
BUT YES, I CAN HAVE
A COMMERCIAL FISHING LICENSE.

03:58.309 --> 04:01.442

WHAT DID YOU SAY YOU WERE GOING
TO PLANT BACK THERE, GRANDMA?

04:39.009 --> 04:42.383
BECAUSE I'M ACTUALLY INTO
EGGPLANT MYSELF.

04:42.383 --> 04:44.885
MAYBE YOU COULD
TAKE A LOOK AT THE GARDEN

04:44.885 --> 04:50.561
AND SEE IF MAYBE WE CAN MAKE
A NICE EGGPLANT PLANT PLANT.

YOU DON'T WANT GRANDMA
TO KNOW YOU'RE DATING NINA?

SOCK. SEE IT.

05:10.010 --> 05:12.443
REMEMBER HOW SHE KNEW
SAM HAD SOMETHING TO DO
WITH THE DEVIL?

05:12.443 --> 05:14.915
YOU DON'T THINK SHE'D
FIGURE OUT NINA'S A DEMON?

05:14.915 --> 05:15.486
YEAH, PROBABLY.

THAT HER GRANDSON IS RAILING
A HOT DEMON.

OUT OF HIS LEAGUE,

06:24.054 --> 06:26.056
YEAH. YEAH, I GUESS IT IS.

06:26.056 --> 06:28.889
OK, WELL, I THINK
WE SHOULD PRETEND

THE FUNERAL? YOU CAN KEEP
A LOOKOUT FROM THERE.

20:46.616 --> 20:47.847
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

20:47.847 --> 20:50.820
MAYBE WE CAN GO BOWLING
AFTER THAT.

20:50.820 --> 20:53.623
WHAT TIME DOES IT START?

20:54.324 --> 20:57.957
AH, YOU SEE GRANDMA OUT THERE,
PLANTING SOME HEALTHY FOOD?

20:57.957 --> 21:01.361
DON'T TELL HER,
BUT I'M GONNA THROW THOSE
VEGGIES IN THE TRASH.

21:01.361 --> 21:04.964
COME ON CHICO, LET'S GO
IN THE LIVING ROOM AND WRESTLE.

21:04.964 --> 21:07.767
YEAH.

21:11.501 --> 21:14.444
HI. MAYBE THIS IS A BAD IDEA,

21:14.444 --> 21:19.449
BUT I LIKE YOUR GRANDSON
WAY TOO MUCH
JUST TO LET THIS GO.

21:19.449 --> 21:20.480
I'M NOT EVIL.

21:20.480 --> 21:23.953
YOU'RE NOT SEEING ME
FOR WHAT I ACTUALLY AM--

21:23.953 --> 21:25.855
A FALLEN ANGEL.

21:25.855 --> 21:27.487
WHILE I MAY KNOW WHAT HELL IS,

21:27.487 --> 21:30.990
I'VE ALSO SEEN THE HIGHEST
REACHES OF HEAVEN--

21:30.990 --> 21:37.497
AND I CAN TELL YOU HONESTLY,
THAT'S WHERE I'D RATHER BE.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.869
HAVE YOU MET ST. PETER?

21:39.869 --> 21:40.730
I HAVE.

21:40.730 --> 21:42.672
WHAT IS HE LIKE?

21:45.405 --> 21:46.336
OH, GOD!

21:46.336 --> 21:51.881
WHEN YOU'RE AROUND HIM,
YOU JUST--YOU FEEL THIS
INCREDIBLE SENSE OF CALM.

21:51.881 --> 21:53.613
IT'S QUITE AMAZING.

21:53.613 --> 21:55.485
WOW. YOU'RE SO LUCKY.

21:55.485 --> 21:57.687
UH, NINA, YOU PROBABLY
DON'T WANT TO DO THAT, OK?

21:57.687 --> 22:01.621
BEN, IT'S OK. WE'RE FINE.
WE'RE JUST HAVING A CHAT.

22:01.621 --> 22:03.793
CHICO. NO!

22:03.793 --> 22:05.324
AAH!

22:05.324 --> 22:07.557
[GASP]

22:07.557 --> 22:11.030
OH, MY GOD! ABUELA!

22:18.838 --> 22:19.539
[DOOR OPENS]

22:19.539 --> 22:21.040
HEY, HOW'S YOUR GRANDMA?

22:21.040 --> 22:22.542
OH, YEAH.

22:22.542 --> 22:22.972
MINOR HEART ATTACK.

22:22.972 --> 22:27.116
BUT SHE'S DOING FINE.
SHE'S GONNA BE THERE
A COUPLE OF MORE DAYS, SO...

22:27.116 --> 22:28.378
MINOR HEART ATTACK, HUH?

22:28.378 --> 22:29.979
IF I GO OUT,
I'M GOING OUT HUGE.

22:29.979 --> 22:31.381
DOUBLE HEART ATTACK.

22:31.381 --> 22:33.022
BUMP. BUMP. BUMP. BUMP.

22:33.022 --> 22:33.923
BFFP! BFFP!

22:33.923 --> 22:38.087
LEFT VENTRICLE ALL OVER YOU.

22:38.087 --> 22:38.958
HAVE YOU TALKED TO NINA?

22:38.958 --> 22:41.030
NAH, SHE FLEW OFF RIGHT
AFTER IT HAPPENED.

22:41.030 --> 22:44.964
I SPECIFICALLY ASKED HER
NOT TO TALK TO
MY GRANDMOTHER.

22:44.964 --> 22:46.566
THAT I HAD IT
UNDER CONTROL.

22:46.566 --> 22:47.937
DID SHE LISTEN TO ME?
NOT AT ALL.

22:47.937 --> 22:51.441
IN ALL FAIRNESS,
THE CHIHUAHUA DID ATTACK HER.

22:51.441 --> 22:54.944
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

22:55.945 --> 22:59.108
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK
ABOUT MY PANTS?

22:59.108 --> 22:59.909
ARE THOSE PINSTRIPE?

22:59.909 --> 23:01.080
YEAH,
IT'S A VERY SUBTLE STRIPE.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.412
BUT STILL NOTICEABLE.
WELL PLAYED.

23:02.412 --> 23:04.954
THANK YOU. I'M GOING TO
A MEMORIAL SERVICE TONIGHT--

23:04.954 --> 23:05.885
GOTTA LOOK GOOD.

23:05.885 --> 23:08.387
YOU STILL CHASING
AFTER THAT FUNERAL CHICK?

23:08.387 --> 23:09.989
PERSISTENT.

23:09.989 --> 23:10.520
YEAH, I KNOW.

23:10.520 --> 23:11.821
I'M GONNA CONVINCE HER
THAT SHE'S DONE GRIEVING
TONIGHT.

23:11.821 --> 23:14.494
I THINK IT'S SAFE TO EXPECT
A LITTLE TONGUE ACTION
AFTER THIS MEMORIAL.

23:14.494 --> 23:16.996
MAYBE DURING.
I DON'T KNOW. WE'LL SEE.

23:16.996 --> 23:17.867
WHO KNOWS?

23:17.867 --> 23:19.999
I'M GONNA GO BACK
TO THE HOSPITAL.

23:19.999 --> 23:21.601
THANKS, FRIENDS.

23:21.601 --> 23:25.404
NO PROBLEM, BENJI.

OH, OF COURSE.
PLEASE SIGN IN.

23:33.412 --> 23:34.784
MM-HMM.

23:34.784 --> 23:39.048

OF MRS. SIMON'S STUDENTS?

23:39.048 --> 23:40.590
I WAS. YEAH.

23:40.590 --> 23:44.554
BUT I'D LIKE TO THINK
I TAUGHT HER AS MUCH AS
SHE TAUGHT ME.

23:44.554 --> 23:45.555
HUH.

23:45.555 --> 23:49.999
WELL, I MUST SAY,
HER STUDENTS CERTAINLY
LOVED HER.

23:49.999 --> 23:51.901
PLEASE GO IN. HAVE A SEAT.

23:51.901 --> 23:53.132
OK.

24:04.814 --> 24:06.876
HEY.

HEY, SOCK.

24:08.778 --> 24:09.619

24:09.619 --> 24:12.722
I'M PRETTY GOOD. YOU KNOW.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED.

24:12.722 --> 24:16.756
I WOKE UP TODAY
AND I SAID TO MYSELF OUT LOUD,

24:16.756 --> 24:20.590
"SOCK YOU ARE DONE MOURNING."

24:21.130 --> 24:21.931
REALLY?

24:21.931 --> 24:23.833
I DID, REALLY.
YEAH, I'VE GRIEVED.

24:23.833 --> 24:26.065
I'VE JUST GRIEVED SO HARD.
I'VE GRIEVED FOR SO LONG.

24:26.065 --> 24:28.898
NOW I HAVE TO MOVE ON.
I WANT TO EMBRACE LIFE.

24:28.898 --> 24:32.842
I WANT TO MAKE OUT
WITH STRANGERS. WE ALL SHOULD.

24:33.873 --> 24:36.145
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

24:36.145 --> 24:40.149
WE NEED TO PUT THIS
DEATH BEHIND US
AND LIVE.

24:40.149 --> 24:41.751
YOU GOT IT.

24:41.751 --> 24:45.054
IT'S WHAT MRS. SIMONS
WOULD HAVE WANTED.

24:45.054 --> 24:46.255
MRS. S.

24:46.255 --> 24:47.957
I'M SO HAPPY I MET YOU.

24:47.957 --> 24:49.889
YOU'RE AN AMAZING MAN, SOCK.

24:49.889 --> 24:52.892
I AM. I KNOW.

24:52.892 --> 24:55.895
THIS IS NATE, MY BOYFRIEND.

24:55.895 --> 24:57.767
HE'S REALLY BEEN CRUSHED
BY ALL THIS.

24:57.767 --> 25:00.029
YEAH. YOUR WHAT?

25:00.029 --> 25:02.171
SOCK WAS JUST TALKING ME
THROUGH MY GRIEF.

25:02.171 --> 25:04.203
AND IT HELPED,
IT REALLY HELPED.

25:04.203 --> 25:06.906
MAYBE YOU CAN HELP NATE TOO.

25:06.906 --> 25:07.937
HMM.

25:07.937 --> 25:09.839
WE ALL REALLY NEED EACH
OTHER RIGHT NOW.

25:09.839 --> 25:13.683
WE CAN PULL THROUGH THIS.

25:13.683 --> 25:15.514
OK. I'M OUT.

25:17.016 --> 25:21.991
EXCUSE ME. BEFORE I BEGIN
THE REMEMBRANCES,

25:21.991 --> 25:23.723
I HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT
ANNOUNCEMENT.

25:23.723 --> 25:26.896
AS YOU KNOW, MRS. SIMONS
WAS A PHILANTHROPIST
AS WELL AS A TEACHER.

25:26.896 --> 25:30.299
SO HER DYING WISH WAS
TO BEQUEATH HER ENTIRE FORTUNE
TO HER STUDENTS.

25:30.299 --> 25:36.305
SO, ALL OF YOU STUDENTS
WHO ATTENDED TODAY'S SPECIAL
MEMORIAL WILL RECEIVE $10,000.

25:36.305 --> 25:40.970
YOU WILL THEN BE ASKED
TO DONATE THAT MONEY TO
A CHARITY OF YOUR CHOICE.

25:40.970 --> 25:42.672
ANY WORTHY CHARITY.

25:42.672 --> 25:45.845
AS A WAY OF HONORING
MRS. SIMMONS'S MEMORY.

25:45.845 --> 25:47.176
THANK YOU.

25:48.748 --> 25:50.950

TO VATICAN CITY?

25:55.224 --> 25:57.687
ROME'S THE CLOSEST?

25:57.687 --> 26:00.029
ROME'S GOOD.

26:00.029 --> 26:02.261
NO, IT'S FOR A FRIEND.

26:02.261 --> 26:05.935
HIS NAME IS ALAN TOWNSEND.

26:06.896 --> 26:10.069
[BELL RINGS]
Man: ORDER UP!

26:10.069 --> 26:11.100
HE'LL CALL YOU BACK.

26:11.100 --> 26:14.043
SORRY. YOU WERE BEING RUDE.

26:14.043 --> 26:17.146
AND GIVEN THE FACT
THAT YOU TWO LET THE SOUL GO,

26:17.146 --> 26:20.049
I SHOULD THINK YOU'D BOTH BE
A BIT MORE ASHAMED.

26:20.049 --> 26:21.210
YOU FELLAS READY TO ORDER?

26:21.210 --> 26:23.613
HI. YEAH, I WOULD LOVE
THE CHICKEN--

26:23.613 --> 26:26.015
HE WILL HAVE NOTHING.

26:26.015 --> 26:29.989
I'LL A CUP OF COFFEE, BLACK,
2 SUGARS.

26:29.989 --> 26:32.091
DAD, ALTHOUGH ME
TO APOLOGIZE.

26:32.091 --> 26:35.965
YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW DISAPPOINTED I AM
IN YOU TWO?

26:35.965 --> 26:37.727
I MEAN, TO THINK THAT ONE DAY
ONE OF YOU

26:37.727 --> 26:43.833
MIGHT ACTUALLY HELP ME
GUIDE MANKIND ON A PATH
TO DESTRUCTION.

26:43.833 --> 26:45.775
IT JUST SIMPLY BOGGLES THE MIND.

26:45.775 --> 26:47.677
BUT DAD, LET ME EXPLAIN--

26:47.677 --> 26:48.037
NO, LET ME.

26:48.037 --> 26:51.210
YOU KNOW WHAT I SEE
WHEN I LOOK AT YOU, MORGAN?

26:51.981 --> 26:56.946
I SEE A BIG, LAZY PUPPY DOG
WITH LAZY PUPPY-DOG EYES

26:56.946 --> 26:59.048
AND A LITTLE PUPPY-DOG BRAIN.

26:59.048 --> 27:01.651
SO EAGER TO PLEASE AND YET SO...

27:01.651 --> 27:03.292
INCAPABLE.

27:04.153 --> 27:07.326
THANK YOU, DEAR.

27:09.258 --> 27:10.129
AND YOU.

27:10.129 --> 27:13.903
SUCH A WHINY LITTLE BABY.

27:13.903 --> 27:15.705
YOU'RE NOT WON'T
BE LAUGHING TONIGHT.

27:15.705 --> 27:18.738
WHEN THAT SOUL FINISHES
WHAT HE'S BEEN WORKING ON.

27:18.738 --> 27:19.038
WHAT'S THAT?

27:19.038 --> 27:23.172
A PORTAL ALLOWING HIS BUDDIES,
A BUNCH OF DEGENERATE SOULS,

27:23.172 --> 27:28.017
MY HARD-EARNED SOULS BY THE WAY,
TO ESCAPE FROM HELL.

27:30.019 --> 27:33.382
HE NEEDS TO BE CAUGHT. NOW.

27:34.283 --> 27:36.385
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

27:50.039 --> 27:52.671
IS THAT REALLY
HOW HE SEES ME?

27:52.671 --> 27:56.145
AS A BIG, LAZY PUPPY DOG?

27:57.146 --> 27:58.377
COME ON, BE HONEST, MAN.

27:58.377 --> 28:00.409
YOU REALLY CARE WHAT HE THINKS?

28:00.409 --> 28:03.112
YEAH. HE'S MY DAD.

28:03.112 --> 28:04.413
YEAH, BUT HE'S THE DEVIL.

28:04.413 --> 28:06.816
HE'S NEVER GONNA BE
A REAL DAD. HE CAN'T.

28:06.816 --> 28:07.887
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

28:07.887 --> 28:09.688
HE'S ALL I GOT.

28:10.019 --> 28:12.061
I JUST WANT TO MAKE HIM
HAPPY.

28:12.061 --> 28:16.065
I'VE LIVED MY ENTIRE LIFE
TRYING TO MEASURE UP

28:16.065 --> 28:18.768
AND THEN FAILING MISERABLY.

28:18.768 --> 28:21.700
YOU KNOW,
YOU WANT TO DO HIM RIGHT?

28:21.700 --> 28:24.233
LET ME HELP YOU WIN THIS. OK?

28:24.233 --> 28:25.404
MORGAN,
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

28:25.404 --> 28:28.077
I DON'T LIKE WORKING FOR HIM,
I DON'T LIKE KNOWING HIM.

28:28.077 --> 28:29.708
I DON'T WANT ANY PART OF THIS.

28:29.708 --> 28:30.840

OK, GOOD.
LET'S GO DO THIS.

28:43.052 --> 28:45.094
SORRY BUD.

28:45.094 --> 28:49.258
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PUT AN END
TO YOUR EXPERIMENT.

28:49.258 --> 28:51.831
SORRY BOYS.

28:52.731 --> 28:55.234
YOU'RE TOO LATE.

29:00.309 --> 29:01.040
AAH!

29:01.040 --> 29:03.973
HURRY UP!
GET HIM. GET HIM!

29:03.973 --> 29:05.744

29:26.535 --> 29:27.366
THE VESSEL'S NOT WORKING!

29:27.366 --> 29:32.101
NOT ON THESE TWO. THE VESSEL
WILL ONLY WORK ON HIM.

29:33.202 --> 29:36.806
GO! I'LL KEEP THESE GUYS BUSY.

30:05.404 --> 30:09.208
MORGAN! RUN! GET OUT OF HERE!

30:09.879 --> 30:12.481
SAM, THE VESSEL'S GONE.

30:30.129 --> 30:31.961
UGH!

30:55.524 --> 30:59.128
THANK YOU FOR SAVING MY LIFE.

31:02.561 --> 31:07.897
BUD--THE SOUL--
YOU SENT HIM BACK TO HELL.

31:07.897 --> 31:09.098
YOU WON THE CONTEST.

31:09.098 --> 31:13.602
WHAT? NO. NO!
I--I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

31:13.602 --> 31:14.303
YOU DID EVERYTHING.

31:14.303 --> 31:16.575
I JUST--
I GAVE HIM A LITTLE PUSH.

31:16.575 --> 31:17.246
THERE'S NO VESSEL RIGHT?

31:17.246 --> 31:20.980
I MEAN, THERE'S NO WAY
TO PROVE WHICH OF US
SENT HIM BACK. RIGHT?

31:20.980 --> 31:22.211
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

31:22.211 --> 31:24.984
YOU'RE A GOOD LIAR.
WE'LL JUST LIE,
TELL THE DEVIL YOU WON.

31:24.984 --> 31:26.115
THERE'S NO PROOF OTHERWISE.

31:26.115 --> 31:30.119
I CAN DO THAT.
I DO LIKE LYING.

31:32.321 --> 31:33.122
YOU SURE YOU'RE COOL, MAN?

31:33.122 --> 31:35.664

BASED ORGANIZATION

31:54.443 --> 31:56.585

PASSIONATE ABOUT.

31:56.585 --> 31:59.448
I'LL BE DONATING
THE MONEY TO HIM.

31:59.448 --> 32:01.520
WHAT TYPE OF CHARITY IS THAT?

32:01.520 --> 32:03.092
HE READS
TO THE BLIND PEOPLE.

32:03.092 --> 32:06.525
AND DELIVERS FOOD
TO HUNGRY ORPHANS
ON CHRISTMAS--

32:06.525 --> 32:07.396
SOCK, PLEASE ALLOW ME.

32:07.396 --> 32:11.160
WHILE IT IS TRUE
THAT I AM INVOLVED IN VARIOUS
COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES,

32:11.160 --> 32:15.934
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
THAT I DO IS WORK MY LABORATORY.

32:15.934 --> 32:18.937
YOU SEE, UH, HOW CAN I PUT THIS?

32:18.937 --> 32:22.371
I'M CREATING A MACHINE
THAT WILL HELP THE ENTIRE WORLD.

32:22.371 --> 32:27.616
AN INVENTION
THAT WILL HELP
LIBERATE MANKIND.

32:27.616 --> 32:31.350
PLEASE, DO TELL? AHEM.

32:31.350 --> 32:33.122
IT'S A STRAW.

32:33.122 --> 32:35.354
A SELF-SUCKING STRAW.

32:35.354 --> 32:40.089
AND IT WILL HELP PEOPLE
WHO HAVE PROBLEMS
USING THEIR JAW

32:40.089 --> 32:44.163
ENJOY THE WONDERS
OF USING A STRAW.

32:44.163 --> 32:45.964

33:06.185 --> 33:07.756
OK. SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

33:07.756 --> 33:10.989
I JUST NEEDED TO PUT
SOMETHING ON THE FORM HERE.

33:10.989 --> 33:13.692
STRAW-TO-MATIC.

33:13.692 --> 33:16.025

THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.

33:17.626 --> 33:21.170
AND I'M SURE SOMEWHERE UP THERE
MRS. SIMONS IS SMILING.

33:21.170 --> 33:22.731
YEAH. YEAH PROBABLY.

33:22.731 --> 33:24.103
GOOD DAY TO YOU, SIR.

33:24.103 --> 33:26.205
AND TO YOU. AHEM.

33:28.477 --> 33:30.039
A SELF-SUCKING STRAW?

33:30.039 --> 33:34.743
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN SITTING
ON THIS GOLD-MINE, BENJAMIN?

33:34.743 --> 33:36.515
I GUESS I THOUGHT ABOUT IT
WHEN I WAS 8.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.016
8? YOU THOUGHT ABOUT
THIS WHEN YOU WERE 8,

33:38.016 --> 33:39.248
AND YOU DIDN'T TELL
ANYBODY UNTIL NOW?

33:39.248 --> 33:41.220
I TOLD MY MOM AND DAD,
BUT THEY DIDN'T GET IT.

33:41.220 --> 33:42.291
OF COURSE NOT,
THEY'RE IDIOTS.

33:42.291 --> 33:43.552
NOW LISTEN TO ME,
WE'RE GONNA TAKE THAT 10 GRAND

33:43.552 --> 33:47.156
USE IT AS SEED MONEY
TO BUILD SOMETHING
THAT'S CALLED A PROTOTYPE.

33:47.156 --> 33:49.398
AFTER THAT HAPPENS, KA-CHING.

33:49.398 --> 33:52.801
Sam: WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"LIVING EXPENSES?"

33:56.605 --> 33:57.366
HE'S TALKING TO ALAN.

33:57.366 --> 33:59.138
YOU WANT A FULL ROW
OF SEATS TO YOURSELF?

33:59.138 --> 34:00.069
YOU KNOW
HOW MUCH THAT COSTS?

34:00.069 --> 34:01.540
NO, THAT WASN'T
PART OF THE DEAL!

34:01.540 --> 34:04.243
ALL RIGHT, WHATEVER.
I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

34:04.243 --> 34:05.074
WHAT?

34:05.074 --> 34:06.044
HE HAS A LIST
OF NEW DEMANDS.

34:06.044 --> 34:09.278
HE'S AFRAID OF BEING TEMPTED
SO HE WANTS TO FLY IN
AN AISLE ALL BY HIMSELF,

34:09.278 --> 34:12.121
HE WANTS MONEY FOR A ONE
BEDROOM APARTMENT.

34:12.121 --> 34:13.122
NO, NO, NO.
HE CAN'T DO THIS.

34:13.122 --> 34:15.184
WELL HE SAYS THE DEAL'S OFF
UNLESS I MEET ALL OF THEM.

34:15.184 --> 34:16.825
WE'RE TALKING
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.

34:16.825 --> 34:22.131
AHEM. WOULD YOU--WOULD YOU
EXCUSE US FOR A MOMENT?

34:22.291 --> 34:23.832
BE RIGHT BACK.

34:23.832 --> 34:26.495
WALK NORMAL. WALK NORMAL.

34:26.495 --> 34:29.067
JUST WALK NORMAL.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.139
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT ARE WE THINKING?

34:30.139 --> 34:31.640
HONESTLY, I'M TORN.
I KNOW, ME TOO.

34:31.640 --> 34:34.803
ON THE ONE HAND, WE GOT
SAM'S SOUL, AND YEAH,
THAT IS IMPORTANT. RIGHT?

34:34.803 --> 34:36.805
BUT THEN ON THE OTHER HAND
YOU GOT THE STRAW-TO-MATIC.

34:36.805 --> 34:40.679
I MEAN, THAT'S A STRAW
THAT SUCKS ON YOUR LIPS,
BENJAMIN.

34:40.679 --> 34:41.280
SUCKS ON YOUR LIPS.

34:41.280 --> 34:43.852
I MEAN, IT HURTS YOUR BRAIN
AT HOW AMAZING THAT IDEA IS.

34:43.852 --> 34:45.284
I MEAN, THAT'S
A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME IDEA.

34:45.284 --> 34:46.385
YEAH. LIGHTNING IN A BOTTLE.

34:46.385 --> 34:47.856
YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S NOT LIKE
ALAN'S GOING ANYWHERE.

34:47.856 --> 34:51.460
NOT AT ALL. BUT SOMEBODY COULD
THINK OF THE STRAW-TO-MATIC--
BEAT US TO THE PUNCH.

34:51.460 --> 34:53.122
HERE'S WHAT WE DO.
HERE'S WHAT WE DO.

34:53.122 --> 34:57.496
WE MAKE OUR MILLIONS
AND THEN WE HELP SAM
DEAL WITH ALAN.

34:57.496 --> 34:59.828
Sam: WHY IS THERE AN ENVELOPE
FULL OF CASH OUT HERE?

34:59.828 --> 35:01.170
HUH?! THAT IS...

35:01.170 --> 35:01.700
FOR YOU.

35:01.700 --> 35:04.803
WE WANTED IT TO BE A SURPRISE
TO HELP YOU WITH ALAN.

35:04.803 --> 35:06.635
HOW DID YOU KNOW ABOUT ALAN?

35:06.635 --> 35:08.807
DO YOU WANT THE MONEY OR NOT?

35:08.807 --> 35:12.110
YES, THANK YOU.

35:17.746 --> 35:18.817
The Devil:
HA HA. THERE HE IS!

35:18.817 --> 35:22.451
CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.
I KNEW YOU'D WIN
THE CONTEST.

35:22.451 --> 35:24.823
KNEW IT. EVEN BET
MY SECRETARY THAT YOU WOULD.

35:24.823 --> 35:26.795
NOW SHE OWES ME A DINNER
AT HOUSTON'S.

35:26.795 --> 35:27.556
NO. NO, MORGAN WON.

35:27.556 --> 35:28.857
HE PUSHED THE SOUL
THROUGH THE PORTAL.

35:28.857 --> 35:29.898
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

35:29.898 --> 35:30.699
COME ON, SAMMY.

35:30.699 --> 35:33.302
YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW
HOW THINGS GO DOWN
IN MY OWN HOUSE?

35:33.302 --> 35:37.906
ENJOY IT, MAN.
YOU'RE MY SECOND IN COMMAND.

35:38.837 --> 35:40.539
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE?

35:40.539 --> 35:42.541
WELL, WE'RE CELEBRATING
SAMMY'S WIN.

35:42.541 --> 35:43.212
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

35:43.212 --> 35:46.415
NO. I KEEP TELLING HIM
THAT I DIDN'T WIN, YOU DID.

35:46.415 --> 35:48.377
HEY, DROP THE FALSE MODESTY
ALL RIGHT.

35:48.377 --> 35:52.551
WE ALL KNOW THAT YOU WANTED
THIS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.

35:53.552 --> 35:54.483
YOU SCREWED ME?

35:54.483 --> 35:57.726
YOU'VE BEEN PLAYING ME
SINCE THE BEGINNING?

35:57.726 --> 35:59.888
NO. NO. I WASN'T. I--

35:59.888 --> 36:01.390
YOU DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN
ANYTHING TO HIM.

36:01.390 --> 36:05.234
HE'S A NOBODY.
HE DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE
YOUR ATTENTION.

36:05.234 --> 36:06.164
BUT DON'T YOU WORRY.

36:06.164 --> 36:09.738
EVEN THOUGH YOU LOST,
YOU GET A NICE
CONSOLATION PRIZE.

36:09.738 --> 36:13.802
10 BUCKS AND A BUS PASS.

36:13.802 --> 36:14.903
ENJOY!

36:14.903 --> 36:19.278
PLEASE, I'M NOT TAKING
YOUR PITY PRIZE.

36:19.278 --> 36:19.708
OH REALLY?

36:19.708 --> 36:21.350
EVEN AFTER YOU FIND OUT
THAT EVERYTHING ELSE IS GONE?

36:21.350 --> 36:27.216
YOUR KEYS. YOUR WALLET.
YOUR CLOTHES. YOUR CAR.
YOUR CONDO. EVERYTHING.

36:27.216 --> 36:30.759
YOU LOOKING FOR THESE, BUDDY?

36:33.722 --> 36:34.523
[GLASS SHATTERS]

36:34.523 --> 36:38.196
YOU'RE A DEAD MAN. DEAD MAN.

36:38.897 --> 36:40.198
OH, THAT GUY, HUH?

36:40.198 --> 36:43.932
LOTS OF BARK AND NO BITE.

36:55.544 --> 36:58.216
WOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

36:58.216 --> 36:59.618
THIS IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING.

36:59.618 --> 37:02.921
I'LL CALL YOU GUYS
WHEN I GET THERE.

37:02.921 --> 37:07.296
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO TELL US?

37:07.756 --> 37:09.558
RIGHT.
RIGHT.

37:09.558 --> 37:09.928
YEAH.

37:09.928 --> 37:15.564
OK. WHAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T
KNOW ABOUT THE IS THAT HE
CAN'T RESIST A COMPETITION.

37:15.564 --> 37:16.965
OK, SO WHAT DOES
THAT MEAN EXACTLY?

37:16.965 --> 37:19.808
YOU KNOW THAT WHOLE DEVIL
WENT DOWN TO GEORGIA THING?

37:19.808 --> 37:22.941
HE CHALLENGED A GUY
TO A FIDDLING CONTEST.

37:22.941 --> 37:23.712
HE'S SO INCREDIBLY VAIN,

37:23.712 --> 37:26.445
HE DOESN'T THINK
THAT ANYBODY CAN BEAT
HIM AT ANYTHING.

37:26.445 --> 37:27.646
FOR ME, IT WAS POKER.

37:27.646 --> 37:29.918
SO, I HAVE TO BEAT HIM AT POKER?

37:29.918 --> 37:32.250
NO, YOU DO
WHAT YOU'RE GOOD AT.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.922
FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT IS
AND CHALLENGE HIM.

37:33.922 --> 37:39.288
HOWEVER, THERE'S ONE MORE
STEP TO GET THE DEVIL
TO AGREE TO THE CHALLENGE.

37:39.288 --> 37:40.729
OK. WHAT'S THAT?

37:40.729 --> 37:41.860
I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT
RIGHT NOW.

37:41.860 --> 37:43.762
WHAT?
WE HAD A DEAL!

37:43.762 --> 37:45.263
LOOK, UNTIL I'M SAFE,

37:45.263 --> 37:47.466
STANDING ON
CONSECRATED GROUND,

37:47.466 --> 37:48.437
I HAVE TO KEEP ONE ACE
UP MY SLEEVE.

37:48.437 --> 37:52.701
I PROMISE YOU I'LL CALL YOU
AS SOON AS I SET FOOT
IN THE VATICAN.

37:52.701 --> 37:54.343
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

37:54.343 --> 37:55.404
I WANT TO HELP YOU.

37:55.404 --> 37:59.548
I JUST WISH I COULD BE THERE
TO SEE HIS FACE WHEN YOU
DO BEAT THE BASTARD.

37:59.548 --> 38:02.951
CALL ME THE SECOND YOU LAND.

38:07.356 --> 38:08.887
YOU BELIEVE HIM?

38:08.887 --> 38:11.920
YEAH. YEAH, I DO.

38:11.920 --> 38:13.492
YOU?

38:13.492 --> 38:15.394
YEAH, I DO.

38:27.305 --> 38:28.437
HEY.

38:28.437 --> 38:29.007
HEY.

38:29.007 --> 38:30.479
FOR YOUR GRANDMA.

38:30.479 --> 38:31.440
AWW, THANKS.

38:31.440 --> 38:31.910
HOW'S SHE DOING?

38:31.910 --> 38:34.513
BETTER. DOCTOR SAID
IT SHOULD JUST BE
A COUPLE MORE DAYS

38:34.513 --> 38:35.043
AND THEN SHE CAN GO HOME.

38:35.043 --> 38:37.946
BEN, I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

38:37.946 --> 38:41.990
SOMETIMES WHEN I GET STARTLED
I JUST LOSE CONTROL.

38:41.990 --> 38:43.422
I KNOW. IT'S FINE.

38:43.422 --> 38:46.054
LET'S JUST FORGET IT
AND MOVE ON ALL RIGHT?

38:46.054 --> 38:46.795
OK.

38:46.795 --> 38:50.759
BUT WE STILL HAVE
TO FIGURE THIS OUT.

38:50.759 --> 38:52.901
I MEAN, DID YOU TALK TO HER
YET ABOUT US?

38:52.901 --> 38:55.333
I DID.
AND IT'S HANDLED, BABY.

38:55.333 --> 38:56.765
OH. GOOD. WHAT HAPPENED?

38:56.765 --> 38:57.736
I TOLD HER I DUMPED YOU.

38:57.736 --> 39:00.739
SO NOW WE CAN JUST DATE
SECRETLY AND SEE
WHERE THAT TAKES US.

39:00.739 --> 39:02.641
IT'S WIN-WIN.

39:03.442 --> 39:04.473
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

39:04.473 --> 39:05.774
I DON'T HAVE
ANY OTHER CHOICE HERE.

39:05.774 --> 39:06.645
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

39:06.645 --> 39:09.347
I WANT TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL
RIGHT NOW

39:09.347 --> 39:13.982
AND TELL YOUR GRANDMA
THAT YOU LOVE ME,
AND YOU WANT US TO BE TOGETHER.

39:13.982 --> 39:15.053
YOU SERIOUS?

39:15.053 --> 39:15.884
WHY NOT?

39:15.884 --> 39:17.826
WELL, FOR ONE THING,
VISITING HOURS ARE OVER.

39:17.826 --> 39:18.987
I COULDN'T GET IN.

39:18.987 --> 39:19.628
BEN YOU COULD GET IN.

39:19.628 --> 39:21.760
I DON'T WANT TO PUT HER
UNDER THAT KIND OF STRESS.

39:21.760 --> 39:22.931
I MEAN,
NOT IN HER CONDITION.

39:22.931 --> 39:24.693
YOU TOLD ME
SHE WAS FEELING BETTER.

39:24.693 --> 39:25.534
SHE'S IN THE I.C.U!

39:25.534 --> 39:27.365
OUR RELATIONSHIP'S
IN THE I.C.U!

39:27.365 --> 39:29.868
BEN, YOU'RE LETTING HER
BULLY YOU.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.039
AND NOW YOU'RE BULLYING ME.

39:31.039 --> 39:31.870
YOU'RE NOT GIVING ME ANY CHOICE.

39:31.870 --> 39:36.374
I JUST WANT YOU TO BE A MAN.
HAVE A BACKBONE.

39:36.374 --> 39:36.805
BACKBONE?

39:36.805 --> 39:40.078
YOU WANT BACKBONE?
HOW ABOUT THIS--IT'S OVER.

39:42.380 --> 39:45.554
DON'T SAY THAT
UNLESS YOU MEAN IT.

39:45.554 --> 39:47.556
I MEAN IT.

39:52.961 --> 39:56.725
YOU BROKE MY HEART ONCE,
AND I FORGAVE YOU.

39:56.725 --> 39:57.726
BUT NOT THIS TIME.

39:57.726 --> 40:01.600
THIS TIME YOU'RE GOING TO WISH
YOU NEVER MET ME.

40:05.634 --> 40:07.636
TOUGH BEAT, MY BROTHER.

40:07.636 --> 40:09.508
SHE'S AMAZING WOMAN.

40:09.508 --> 40:11.880
I WOULD KILL THAT ASS.

40:17.546 --> 40:18.617
ALAN JUST TEXTED ME.

40:18.617 --> 40:20.789
HIS FLIGHT'S
ABOUT TO TAKE OFF.

40:20.789 --> 40:22.891
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

40:22.891 --> 40:24.192
I'M GOING TO BEAT THE DEVIL.

40:24.192 --> 40:26.855
I KNOW.
HOW DOES IT FEEL?

40:26.855 --> 40:29.157
I FEEL LIKE ME AGAIN.

40:29.157 --> 40:31.099
DOES THAT MAKE ANY SENSE?

40:31.099 --> 40:32.200
YEAH. TOTALLY.

40:32.200 --> 40:34.903
I DID IT. I BEAT THE DEVIL!

40:34.903 --> 40:37.165
I'M DONE! WHOO!

40:37.165 --> 40:38.707
WHOO!

40:38.707 --> 40:40.769
SORRY.

40:40.769 --> 40:41.870
I DON'T CARE.
IT FEELS SO GOOD.

40:41.870 --> 40:46.144
SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
WITH YOUR NEW-FOUND FREEDOM?

40:46.144 --> 40:48.577
I MIGHT LEARN
A NEW LANGUAGE.

40:48.577 --> 40:49.077
REALLY?
NO.

40:49.077 --> 40:50.779
PROBABLY JUST GONNA NAP
A LOT.

40:50.779 --> 40:52.551
OK.

40:52.881 --> 40:56.024
THANK YOU SO MUCH, THOUGH.

40:56.024 --> 40:57.986
FOR STICKING WITH ME.

40:57.986 --> 40:59.858
OF COURSE.

41:10.699 --> 41:12.200
OK. SORRY.

41:12.200 --> 41:15.173
SORRY, I JUST HAD TO DO THAT.

41:15.173 --> 41:18.907
YEAH. YEAH.
WE JUST KISSED A LOT.

41:18.907 --> 41:22.751
AND I WANT TO DO IT AGAIN.

41:22.751 --> 41:25.053
ME TOO.

41:25.053 --> 41:31.059
BUT UH, WE SHOULD--
WE SHOULD WAIT
UNTIL TOMORROW.

41:31.059 --> 41:32.561
I'LL BE OUT OF MY DEAL
WITH THE DEVIL.

41:32.561 --> 41:34.863
THEN WE CAN KISS
AS MUCH AS WE WANT.

41:34.863 --> 41:38.997
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.

41:40.729 --> 41:42.130
THANK YOU.

41:42.130 --> 41:44.002
[AIRPLANE P.A. RING]

41:44.002 --> 41:46.835
HI. THIS IS
YOUR CAPTAIN SPEAKING.

41:46.835 --> 41:47.976
WE JUST GOT WORD
FROM FLIGHT DECK

41:47.976 --> 41:53.011
THAT WE NEED TO GO AHEAD
AND MAKE AN UNSCHEDULED
MAINTENANCE STOP.

41:53.011 --> 41:55.714
WE APOLOGIZE
FOR THIS INCONVENIENCE,

41:55.714 --> 41:59.287
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS,
WE'LL BE STOPPING
IN LAS VEGAS!

41:59.287 --> 42:02.250
YOU WILL EACH RECEIVE $100
IN CASINO CHIPS

42:02.250 --> 42:04.653
TO TIDE YOU OVER
WHILE WE'RE ON THE GROUND.

42:04.653 --> 42:11.059
SO PLEASE, ENJOY YOUR TIME
IN THE GAMBLING CAPITAL
OF THE WORLD.

42:11.059 --> 42:13.932
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING
TO DRINK?
