This is a very important meeting

06:23.550 --> 06:24.616
We're having here at our

06:24.618 --> 06:26.952
Giant boardroom table.

06:26.954 --> 06:28.019
>> how goes it?

06:28.021 --> 06:29.621
>> welcome to the show.

06:29.623 --> 06:31.590
>> sick.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.425
>> what was it about this show

06:33.427 --> 06:34.993
That attracted you?

06:34.995 --> 06:37.295
>> my natural curiosity,

06:37.297 --> 06:38.997
But i've had it happen

06:38.999 --> 06:40.365
To me before, but it's also--

06:40.367 --> 06:41.233
>> you've had what happen?

06:41.235 --> 06:42.000
>> i've been catfished.

06:42.002 --> 06:42.667
>> you had, like,

06:42.669 --> 06:43.402
An online friend or...

06:43.404 --> 06:44.069
>> yes, totally.

06:44.071 --> 06:44.736
>> what was it? Explain.

06:44.738 --> 06:45.537
>> i was totally into

06:45.539 --> 06:46.972
This person who was online,

06:46.974 --> 06:48.507
And i ended up going to d.C.

06:48.509 --> 06:49.207
To meet them,

06:49.209 --> 06:50.742
And she totally, like,

06:50.744 --> 06:52.210
Came as a different person.

06:52.212 --> 06:53.445
It was weird because i'm not

06:53.447 --> 06:54.746
Shallow enough to be like, "oh,

06:54.748 --> 06:55.680
I don't like you anymore

06:55.682 --> 06:57.883
Because you're 200 pounds."

06:57.885 --> 06:58.984
That's stupid to me,

06:58.986 --> 07:00.051
Except, when you make

07:00.053 --> 07:01.386
The decision to lie to someone,

07:01.388 --> 07:03.321
Then you also make that decision

07:03.323 --> 07:04.289
To accept the fact that you're

07:04.291 --> 07:05.690
Risking losing them as well.

07:05.692 --> 07:06.491
>> yeah.

07:06.493 --> 07:07.292
He's right here in

07:07.294 --> 07:10.395
This little apartment building.

07:10.397 --> 07:11.530
>> all right, i'm gonna knock.

07:11.532 --> 07:12.497
[knocking sternly]

07:12.499 --> 07:13.165
>> wow, that's

07:13.167 --> 07:14.699
Like a police knock.

07:14.701 --> 07:15.400
Hey.

07:15.402 --> 07:16.234
Whoa. There he is.

07:16.236 --> 07:16.902
>> how you doing?

07:16.904 --> 07:17.569
>> hey, man.

07:17.571 --> 07:18.236

07:25.412 --> 07:26.411
Well, here we go.

07:26.413 --> 07:27.546
[laughs]

07:27.548 --> 07:28.313
You got your name

07:28.315 --> 07:29.214
On your basketball.

07:29.216 --> 07:30.449
That's so adorable.

07:30.451 --> 07:31.316
>> you know, i don't want nobody

07:31.318 --> 07:32.884
To just walk off with it.

07:32.886 --> 07:33.785
>> whoa.

07:33.787 --> 07:34.653
>> the hell?

07:34.655 --> 07:37.155

07:39.226 --> 07:39.891
>> no.

07:39.893 --> 07:40.759
>> so how is school going?

07:40.761 --> 07:41.426
Freshman year,

07:41.428 --> 07:42.394
It's going pretty well?

07:42.396 --> 07:43.195
>> it's real good.

07:43.197 --> 07:44.329
It's nice to, like,

07:44.331 --> 07:45.831
Move away from,

07:45.833 --> 07:47.098
Like, the small town

07:47.100 --> 07:47.999
I come from 'cause

07:48.001 --> 07:49.067
A lot happened over the summer,

07:49.069 --> 07:50.001
Actually.

07:50.003 --> 07:50.702
>> what happened?

07:50.704 --> 07:51.570
>> i lost seven friends

07:51.572 --> 07:54.739
In two months over gun violence.

07:54.741 --> 07:55.407
>> gun violence?

07:55.409 --> 07:56.074
>> yeah.

Your hometown died this summer?

07:59.646 --> 08:00.445
>> yes.

08:00.447 --> 08:01.513
>> all a related thing,

08:01.515 --> 08:02.747
Or was it, like, all at once?

08:02.749 --> 08:03.415
What happened?

08:03.417 --> 08:04.216
>> it was, like,

08:04.218 --> 08:05.550
As days went on.

08:05.552 --> 08:06.418
>> wow.

08:06.420 --> 08:07.986
>> yeah.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.222
It's eating me up inside.

08:10.224 --> 08:11.223
Like, it's hard

08:11.225 --> 08:13.358
To focus on school sometimes.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.327
>> were your friends in gangs?

08:15.329 --> 08:16.261
>> like, i wasn't part

08:16.263 --> 08:17.028
Of none of that,

08:17.030 --> 08:18.263
But, like, i had friends

08:18.265 --> 08:19.931
That did stuff like that.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.633
I have gotten shot at before.

08:21.635 --> 08:22.300
>> wow.

08:24.705 --> 08:25.770
And there's one, two,

08:25.772 --> 08:27.072
Three cars in front of us,

08:27.074 --> 08:29.841
And then they let a shot off.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.376
It grazed somebody in the neck,

08:31.378 --> 08:34.346
And it went past my head too.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.614
Felt, like, the heat

08:35.616 --> 08:36.615
On the back of the neck.

08:36.616 --> 08:37.749
>> that's ruthless.

08:37.751 --> 08:38.750
>> that was one of my friends

08:38.751 --> 08:40.018
That died later on

08:40.020 --> 08:40.684
In the summer.

08:40.687 --> 08:41.352
>> wow.

08:41.355 --> 08:42.888
>> so you're dealing with a lot

08:42.890 --> 08:43.855
In your freshman year.

08:43.857 --> 08:44.523
>> mm-hmm.

08:44.525 --> 08:45.423
>> and i'm just gonna

08:45.425 --> 08:46.658
Take a wild guess, the girl

08:46.660 --> 08:48.460
Makes it all feel better.

08:48.462 --> 08:49.528
>> she was real supportive,

08:49.530 --> 08:51.296
Actually, because i didn't talk

08:51.298 --> 08:53.365
To anybody else about it.

08:57.770 --> 08:59.237
>> it might be love.

08:59.239 --> 09:00.238
You're not sure.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.073
>> it feels like it, but, yeah,

09:02.075 --> 09:03.408
It's like, i don't know

How i could love somebody

09:04.444 --> 09:05.377

09:28.602 --> 09:30.235
To call me off that number

09:30.237 --> 09:31.570
When me and armani stopped

09:31.572 --> 09:33.605
Talking, and i picked up.

09:33.607 --> 09:34.806
I was like, "um, who is this?"

09:34.808 --> 09:35.473
And then she was like,

09:35.475 --> 09:37.542
"this is armani's friend."

09:38.878 --> 09:40.111
She was like, "why you stop

09:40.113 --> 09:41.146
Talking to armani?"

09:41.148 --> 09:42.380
And i just kind of hung up.

09:42.382 --> 09:43.682
Another one of her friends

09:43.684 --> 09:45.283
Tried to add me on facebook.

09:45.285 --> 09:46.818
Uh, deshyla?

09:46.820 --> 09:47.786
>> deshyla?

09:47.788 --> 09:48.853

09:48.855 --> 09:50.088
Like armani added me

09:50.090 --> 09:52.190
On her friend's page, actually.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.959
>> to spy on you or something.

09:53.961 --> 09:54.726
>> yeah.

09:54.728 --> 09:56.127
>> how did we get from you

09:56.129 --> 09:58.763
Having armani blocked

09:58.765 --> 10:00.231
And her friend blocked back

10:00.233 --> 10:02.467
Into where we are now?

10:02.469 --> 10:04.569
>> i shot her a text, and--

10:04.571 --> 10:05.537
>> and then you spoke.

10:05.539 --> 10:06.204

She was already pregnant.

10:13.046 --> 10:13.745
She said it was,

10:13.747 --> 10:14.779
Like, a accident.

10:32.165 --> 10:36.668
Her when you think about her?

10:36.670 --> 10:38.770
>> trust.

10:38.772 --> 10:39.804
>> so she's trustworthy?

10:39.806 --> 10:40.472
>> yeah, 'cause

10:40.474 --> 10:41.640
I have trust issues,

10:41.642 --> 10:43.708
But i kind of gave her a chance,

10:43.710 --> 10:44.676
And i don't do that with

10:44.678 --> 10:46.344
Anybody else.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.013
Anybody else.

10:48.015 --> 10:50.048
>> you never meet guys like you

10:50.050 --> 10:51.950
In this day and age.

10:51.952 --> 10:52.917
I think it says a lot

10:52.919 --> 10:54.052
About your willingness

10:54.054 --> 10:54.953
And your ability

10:54.955 --> 10:56.187
To connect with people.

10:56.189 --> 10:58.456
It's seriously endearing.

11:00.427 --> 11:01.292
And you guys started dating,

>> it'll be a big thing.

11:04.531 --> 11:05.296

A serious relationship?

11:09.403 --> 11:11.269
>> yeah. I hope so.

11:11.271 --> 11:12.170
>> i don't know what we're gonna

11:12.172 --> 11:13.304
Find or not find.

11:13.306 --> 11:13.972
It may not be

11:13.974 --> 11:15.740
Exactly what you want to hear.

11:15.742 --> 11:16.975
>> i'm ready.

Such a sweet guy.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.853
[groans]

11:28.855 --> 11:29.688
Look, the reason

11:29.690 --> 11:31.289
That i'm always open-minded

11:31.291 --> 11:32.991
And hopeful is because i've seen

11:32.993 --> 11:34.159
So many situations

11:34.161 --> 11:36.227
That were so unpredictable.

11:36.229 --> 11:37.729
Like, you've got to be open

To both sides of the story.

So let's take that tiny

12:30.083 --> 12:32.183
Thumbnail picture of armani

12:32.185 --> 12:34.319
And see if it shows up

12:34.321 --> 12:36.721

12:50.270 --> 12:52.203
>> no name.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.339
That's evil.

12:54.341 --> 12:55.373

All right, so this

13:14.394 --> 13:16.561
Is maybe her dad.

13:16.563 --> 13:17.729
The fact that her old phone

Number is registered to someone

13:18.765 --> 13:19.831
Named marcus brown...

>> mm-hmm.

13:20.634 --> 13:22.700

Been telling the truth

13:25.472 --> 13:27.205

I just think she's either

17:08.694 --> 17:09.894
Telling us the truth

17:09.896 --> 17:11.029
And armani is a person

17:11.031 --> 17:12.163
Who's just super private,

17:12.165 --> 17:16.267
Or she's covering for her friend

Named tamila, possibly,

Or babay gotem' madd.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.359
That's close enough.

18:48.361 --> 18:49.427
>> 200 pounds.

18:49.429 --> 18:51.462
>> that's more than me.

18:51.464 --> 18:52.130
>> is it?

18:52.132 --> 18:53.097
>> yeah.

18:53.099 --> 18:56.334
>> what if this is armani?

18:56.336 --> 18:58.936
>> hmm.

18:58.938 --> 18:59.871
Might have

18:59.873 --> 19:01.973
Some difficulty there.

19:01.975 --> 19:03.908
>> why?

19:03.910 --> 19:04.942
>> that picture

19:04.944 --> 19:06.210
Was stuck in my brain,

19:06.212 --> 19:07.612
And when i see this picture,

19:07.614 --> 19:09.347
It's, like, the complete

19:09.349 --> 19:10.248
Opposite of what's on

19:10.250 --> 19:13.251
That picture.

19:13.253 --> 19:14.085
But, like i said,

19:14.087 --> 19:16.420
We're not 100% sure yet,

19:16.422 --> 19:17.722
So i still--

19:17.724 --> 19:19.657
Just trying to hang in there.

19:19.659 --> 19:20.625
>> so the next thing we did

19:20.627 --> 19:21.859
Was--you told us that you

19:21.861 --> 19:23.494
Got a friend request

19:23.496 --> 19:25.029
From one of armani's friends...

19:25.031 --> 19:25.696
>> mm-hmm.

19:25.698 --> 19:26.497
>> that you didn't accept.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.866
This girl deshyla, right?

19:28.868 --> 19:30.101
So i spoke to her,

19:30.103 --> 19:31.002
And i asked her if she

19:31.004 --> 19:33.404
Knew someone named armani.

19:33.406 --> 19:34.372
She said, "oh, yeah.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.841
That's my friend."

19:36.843 --> 19:37.975
>> "i was with her an hour ago,"

19:37.977 --> 19:38.643
She said.

19:38.645 --> 19:39.477
>> yeah, she was with her,

19:39.479 --> 19:40.878
She said.

19:40.880 --> 19:41.779
>> hmm.

19:41.781 --> 19:42.713
>> and so i was like, "oh,

19:42.715 --> 19:43.714
Does she have a son?"

19:43.716 --> 19:44.982
She said, "yeah.

19:44.984 --> 19:46.484
She's got a newborn."

19:46.486 --> 19:47.685
>> deshyla also said

19:47.687 --> 19:49.120
That the baby was jrue.

19:49.122 --> 19:50.988
>> oh-whee. Ooh.

19:50.990 --> 19:51.722
>> i said, "do you ever

19:51.724 --> 19:54.058
Hear her talk about harold?"

19:54.060 --> 19:55.493
>> she's like, "ha-ha.

19:55.495 --> 19:56.327
She talks about harold

19:56.329 --> 19:57.195
All the time.

19:57.197 --> 19:58.563
That's all she cares about."

19:58.565 --> 19:59.263
>> yeah,

19:59.265 --> 20:00.631
And she confirmed everything

20:00.633 --> 20:02.466
You think is true.

20:02.468 --> 20:03.568
>> right.

20:03.570 --> 20:04.669
>> so the next thing we did--

20:04.671 --> 20:05.970
You told us that this

20:05.972 --> 20:08.439
Babay gotem' madd called you.

20:08.441 --> 20:09.106
>> yeah.

20:09.108 --> 20:09.774
>> right?

20:09.776 --> 20:10.441
It says that she's

20:10.443 --> 20:11.642
From kankakee.

20:11.644 --> 20:14.145
Does this girl appeal to you?

20:14.147 --> 20:14.845
>> yeah.

20:14.847 --> 20:15.546
>> oh, yeah?

20:15.548 --> 20:16.280
>> seriously?

20:16.282 --> 20:18.482
>> she looks kind of tall.

20:18.484 --> 20:19.550
She talks like that.

20:19.552 --> 20:20.218
>> yup.

20:20.220 --> 20:20.885
>> with, like, two qs?

20:20.887 --> 20:21.552
>> yeah.

20:21.554 --> 20:22.220
>> and then wait.

20:22.222 --> 20:23.888
Check this out.

20:23.890 --> 20:24.555
>> oh!

20:24.557 --> 20:26.290
>> on august 26th.

20:26.292 --> 20:27.091
>> "jrue in his

20:27.093 --> 20:28.526
Tommy hilfiger hat!!"

20:28.528 --> 20:29.527
>> it doesn't say, like,

20:29.529 --> 20:30.194
"my nephew."

20:30.196 --> 20:30.861
It doesn't say,

20:30.863 --> 20:31.762
"my friend's kid."

20:31.764 --> 20:33.664
It says just jrue.

20:33.666 --> 20:34.465
>> hmm.

20:34.467 --> 20:35.866
Now i'm thinking that maybe

20:35.868 --> 20:37.001
That's not her friend.

20:37.003 --> 20:38.536
Maybe that's her.

20:38.538 --> 20:39.804
>> i can't understand why this

20:39.806 --> 20:41.472
Girl, who takes lots of pictures

20:41.474 --> 20:42.640
And puts them online...

20:42.642 --> 20:43.608
>> wouldn't send me any.

20:43.610 --> 20:44.675
>> who's got a smartphone,

20:44.677 --> 20:46.744
Wouldn't be sending 'em to you.

20:50.015 --> 20:51.182
>> no.

20:51.184 --> 20:51.983
>> but you definitely

20:51.985 --> 20:54.051
Like this chick.

20:56.021 --> 20:58.823
>> oh, jesus [bleep].

20:58.825 --> 21:00.791
Sorry. It's physicality.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.193
It's physicality for him.

21:02.195 --> 21:03.628
It's it. That's it.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.496
>> no, it's not, but, like--

21:05.498 --> 21:06.797
>> i was rooting for you.

21:06.799 --> 21:07.965
It's just, i'm having

21:07.967 --> 21:08.933
Trouble understanding

21:08.935 --> 21:10.468
How you're gonna be able to,

21:10.470 --> 21:11.402
One, as a person

21:11.404 --> 21:12.570
Who has, like, said

21:12.572 --> 21:13.838
That you have trust issues--

21:13.840 --> 21:14.939
Anyone that i've ever dated,

21:14.941 --> 21:16.040
Like, regardless of whether

21:16.042 --> 21:16.974
It was on the internet

21:16.976 --> 21:18.476
Or in person, had lied to me

21:18.478 --> 21:19.143
About something

21:19.145 --> 21:21.012
As simple their favorite color.

21:21.014 --> 21:21.846
So if someone can lie to you

21:21.848 --> 21:22.847
About something as small as a

21:22.849 --> 21:24.148
Name, then what else can they

21:24.150 --> 21:25.249
Lie to you about?

21:25.251 --> 21:26.517
How are you, like,

21:26.519 --> 21:28.653
Making that okay in your head?

21:28.655 --> 21:29.353
>> i mean, you have

21:29.355 --> 21:30.855
To take into consideration

21:30.857 --> 21:32.890
That everybody's not,

21:32.892 --> 21:34.525
You know, perfect.

21:34.527 --> 21:35.393
>> i would just think

21:35.395 --> 21:37.728
That you're settling.

21:37.730 --> 21:38.763
>> if we want to know who armani

21:38.765 --> 21:41.232
Is, we need to call armani,

21:41.234 --> 21:42.266
If it's cool with you.

21:42.268 --> 21:43.200
>> that's cool.

21:43.202 --> 21:44.802
>> because hopefully she's ready

21:44.804 --> 21:47.405
To finally meet you too.

21:52.912 --> 21:53.978

21:53.980 --> 21:55.579
You've been in this relationship

21:55.581 --> 21:56.614
For so long,

21:56.616 --> 21:57.615
And it's all been about,

21:57.617 --> 21:58.983

Built on trust.

22:09.228 --> 22:11.562
Hasn't been honest with you.

22:11.564 --> 22:12.330
What does it matter

22:12.332 --> 22:13.698
What she looks like?

22:13.700 --> 22:14.732

22:36.889 --> 22:38.255
Is making the call.

22:38.257 --> 22:38.956
[exhales deeply]

Okay, ready?

23:15.460 --> 23:16.293
>> i mean, come on.

23:16.295 --> 23:18.596
I bet you could figure it out.

23:23.435 --> 23:24.635
>> yeah, that's right,

23:24.637 --> 23:25.936
Our man harold.

23:25.938 --> 23:27.571
The one thing kind of

23:27.573 --> 23:28.406
That he really wants

23:28.408 --> 23:29.407
Almost more than anything

23:29.409 --> 23:30.574
Is to finally meet you,

23:30.576 --> 23:32.176
So he asked

23:32.178 --> 23:34.245
If we could help him out.

23:42.721 --> 23:43.587
>> well, yeah.

23:43.589 --> 23:44.388
What is the deal

23:44.390 --> 23:46.557
With your facebook page?

Harold a picture of yourself?

24:08.980 --> 24:09.847
>> all right.

24:09.849 --> 24:10.781
Well, then i guess the question

24:10.783 --> 24:11.816
Is, how would you feel

24:11.818 --> 24:13.884
About trying to meet up?

24:28.500 --> 24:29.467
>> okay.

24:45.818 --> 24:46.884
Who she could actually be.

24:46.886 --> 24:48.018
>> and everything i asked her,

24:48.020 --> 24:49.220
She had an answer for.

24:49.222 --> 24:50.054
>> perfect answer to.

24:52.792 --> 24:53.624
At least we know we're going

24:53.626 --> 24:54.458
To get an answer.

24:54.460 --> 24:55.359
The only thing that could

24:55.361 --> 24:56.994
Possibly put his mind

24:56.996 --> 24:58.329
To rest is just...

24:58.331 --> 24:59.563
>> meeting her.

24:59.565 --> 25:00.664
It just--it scares me 'cause

25:00.666 --> 25:02.733
It could go either way.

25:05.437 --> 25:06.103
>> so did you make it

To your class?

>> well, back at the hotel,

25:18.684 --> 25:20.217
We called her.

25:20.219 --> 25:21.685
I just said, like, "can we come

25:21.687 --> 25:24.088
And see you?"

25:24.090 --> 25:26.857
And she said, "yes."

25:26.859 --> 25:28.526
>> wow.

25:28.528 --> 25:29.193
>> there's still a lot

25:29.195 --> 25:29.860
Of questions,

25:29.862 --> 25:31.228
But it looks like we'll get

25:31.230 --> 25:32.162
The answers we need

25:32.164 --> 25:33.631
When we just meet up with her.

25:33.633 --> 25:34.298
Well, i think we should

25:34.300 --> 25:35.132
Hit the road.

25:35.134 --> 25:37.902
>> i'm ready.

25:37.904 --> 25:39.203
>> i'm feeling like she could be

25:39.205 --> 25:40.704
Anyone in the world.

25:40.706 --> 25:43.040
>> there's babay,

25:43.042 --> 25:44.642
And there's tamila,

25:44.644 --> 25:45.442
And then there's also

25:45.444 --> 25:46.176
Just the armani.

25:46.178 --> 25:48.379
It could just be her.

25:48.381 --> 25:49.647
Would you say that you feel

25:49.649 --> 25:51.682
Like you love this girl?

25:51.684 --> 25:52.783
>> it feels like it.

25:52.785 --> 25:54.151
I could have a bad day,

25:54.153 --> 25:55.553
And i could call armani,

25:55.555 --> 25:57.922
And just makes me feel better.

25:57.924 --> 25:59.256
We could be playing around,

25:59.258 --> 26:01.125
Talking about, like, gonna

26:01.127 --> 26:02.393
Get married in a few years.

26:02.395 --> 26:03.193
>> you guys have talked about

Isn't that what you fell in love

And emotionally,

30:41.540 --> 30:42.906

30:42.908 --> 30:44.208

You were, like,

30:45.110 --> 30:46.243
The person in that picture,

30:46.245 --> 30:47.444

>> you pretended to be

31:45.437 --> 31:46.403
He's not living his life

31:46.405 --> 31:47.404
Because you guys are [bleep]

Or whatever?

34:44.416 --> 34:45.081
>> okay.

34:45.083 --> 34:45.916

34:45.918 --> 34:47.117
Win, i'll give you [bleep]

34:47.119 --> 34:48.051

For 20 minutes."

34:50.688 --> 34:51.388
>> oh.

34:51.389 --> 34:52.222
>> and then, okay,

34:52.224 --> 34:53.322
The heat won, so then she

34:53.324 --> 34:54.658
Was like, "okay, i owe you."

>> do you feel like you

34:55.694 --> 34:58.128
Know that person at all?

34:58.130 --> 35:00.197

Just saying myself.

37:15.901 --> 37:16.933
About sex on my page,

37:16.935 --> 37:17.801
I would probably--they'd be

37:17.803 --> 37:18.802
Like, "why would you say that?"

37:18.804 --> 37:20.136
But on her page, they'd be like,

And that's why i picked

37:26.578 --> 37:27.444
A light-skinned girl

37:27.446 --> 37:28.612
For her picture.

37:28.614 --> 37:29.546
Got way more attention

37:41.126 --> 37:41.858
You have to start

37:41.860 --> 37:42.926
Accepting yourself.

37:42.928 --> 37:43.860
>> so it's easier said

37:43.862 --> 37:44.861

Hold you, like, down.

Be me from here on out.

38:03.715 --> 38:05.282
Never really be with them,

38:05.284 --> 38:05.982
Just pretending

38:05.984 --> 38:07.217
Like everything's okay.

38:07.219 --> 38:07.917
>> mm-hmm.

38:07.919 --> 38:09.119

38:09.121 --> 38:09.819
And you know you can't

38:13.892 --> 38:15.959
Probably messed it up.

38:25.369 --> 38:26.069
