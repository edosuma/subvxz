We have to assume
the ship that attacked us is still in orbit.

13:27.181 --> 13:30.183
How long will we have before

13:30.351 --> 13:32.101
If their sensors function
as well as ours,

13:32.269 --> 13:34.062
it could be as little as 30 seconds.

13:36.690 --> 13:39.275

13:56.836 --> 13:59.170
to keep the Borg
from realizing we're in orbit?

13:59.338 --> 14:02.423
We can enter orbit while they're
on the far side of the planet.

14:02.591 --> 14:05.927
And if we delay dropping out
of warp until the last possible instant,

14:06.095 --> 14:07.428
we could gain a few more seconds.

If your calculations
are even slightly off,

14:10.182 --> 14:11.641

This could take hours.

Lore must have told Data
to take my VISOR because he realized

I could see a carrier wave
that was radiating from him.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.154
A carrier wave?

17:11.321 --> 17:13.531
Is that how he's manipulating Data?

17:13.699 --> 17:17.035
I think what's happening
is that Lore is tapping into the chip

17:17.202 --> 17:19.454
he stole from Dr. Soong
and somehow he's found a way

17:19.621 --> 17:22.832

But the only emotions

17:26.295 --> 17:28.171
Yeah, I'm sure that's intentional.

17:28.338 --> 17:30.798
But in order for Data to be affected
by those emotions,

17:30.966 --> 17:34.135
Lore would have had to disable
his ethical program first.

If I can generate a phased
kedion pulse at the right frequency,

17:38.557 --> 17:41.976
that would trigger Data's subsystems
and reboot the program.

17:42.853 --> 17:46.314
And although Lore would still be
feeding him negative emotions,

We knew it was a possibility.

for Lore to dominate us.

a single-minded collective.

19:54.735 --> 19:57.236
The voices in our heads
were smooth and flowing.

19:57.571 --> 20:01.449
But after I returned,
those voices began to change.

20:01.617 --> 20:05.036
They became uneven, discordant.

20:05.204 --> 20:10.875
For the first time, individual Borg had
differing ideas about how to proceed.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.085
We couldn't function.

20:13.503 --> 20:15.004
Some Borg fought each other.

Many starved to death.

20:18.258 --> 20:19.884

You probably can't imagine what
it is like to be so lost and frightened

20:23.096 --> 20:25.681

to any voice which promises change.

insists on controlling you?

he seemed like a savior.

20:42.491 --> 20:45.368

everything he asked of us.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.455
But after a while, it became clear

20:49.623 --> 20:52.583
that Lore had no idea
how to keep his promise.

20:52.751 --> 20:57.630

the need for us to make sacrifices.

41:48.756 --> 41:50.882
affected me more than I realized.

41:51.717 --> 41:53.051
What will you do now?

41:54.220 --> 41:55.553
[SIGHS

41:55.930 --> 41:57.680
I don't know.

41:58.098 --> 42:00.850
We can't go back
to the Borg Collective.

42:01.602 --> 42:03.937
And we no longer have
a leader here.

42:04.980 --> 42:06.814
I'm not sure that's true.

42:09.193 --> 42:13.780
Perhaps in time, we will learn
to function as individuals

42:13.948 --> 42:16.366
and work together as a group.

42:18.118 --> 42:19.869
Good luck, Hugh.

42:21.956 --> 42:23.581
Goodbye.

42:25.960 --> 42:29.629
PICARD:
Captain's log, stardate 47025.4.

42:29.797 --> 42:31.631
We have returned
to Federation space

42:31.799 --> 42:34.050
and are en route to Starbase 295.

42:34.468 --> 42:38.054
Mr. La Forge remains
under Dr. Crusher's care.

42:41.016 --> 42:42.433
[DOOR CHIMES]

42:42.810 --> 42:44.310
Enter.

42:49.984 --> 42:51.693
Hi, Data.

42:53.112 --> 42:54.904
I wanted to let you know
that Dr. Crusher says

42:55.072 --> 42:56.698
I'll be able to return to duty soon.

42:59.827 --> 43:05.373
I am relieved that the injuries
I inflicted on you are not permanent.

43:08.335 --> 43:09.836
What's that?

43:10.546 --> 43:12.547
This is the chip
my father created for me

43:12.715 --> 43:14.424
so that I could experience emotion.

43:14.592 --> 43:17.260
I had it removed from Lore's body
before he was dismantled.

43:17.428 --> 43:19.220
Does it work?

43:19.388 --> 43:20.847
No.

43:21.348 --> 43:25.268
I am pleased to say it was damaged
when I was forced to fire on Lore.

43:25.436 --> 43:26.894
Pleased?

43:27.062 --> 43:29.147
Data, you've wanted emotions
your whole life.

43:30.816 --> 43:32.442
Yes.

43:32.985 --> 43:35.445
But emotions are responsible
for what l did to you.

43:36.030 --> 43:38.489
I would never risk
letting that happen again.

43:38.657 --> 43:43.244
My friendship with you
is too important to me.

43:46.540 --> 43:49.876
Data, I wouldn't be
very much of a friend

43:50.044 --> 43:51.961
if I let you give up
on a lifelong dream,

43:52.129 --> 43:53.755
now would l?

43:55.174 --> 43:57.925
Maybe someday...

43:59.178 --> 44:01.095
...when you're ready.
