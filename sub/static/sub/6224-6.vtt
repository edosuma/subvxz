WEBVTT

00:02.419 --> 00:05.752
Great dragon:
In a land of myth and a time of magic...

00:05.923 --> 00:10.667
The destiny of a great kingdom
rests on the shoulders of a young man.

00:10.844 --> 00:14.052
His name: Merlin.

00:25.651 --> 00:28.859
Even after all these years,
I still miss him.

00:31.198 --> 00:32.779
He was a good father.

00:35.619 --> 00:37.029
I'm glad we came.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.486
Soam I

00:51.176 --> 00:52.837
Gwaine: I think you'd be proud.

00:53.011 --> 00:55.548
Gwen: Particularly of elyan.
Elyan: Me?

00:55.722 --> 00:58.680
Not just because you're a knight,
but of the man you've become.

00:58.850 --> 01:00.662
Elyan: I don't think so.
Percival: She's right.

01:00.686 --> 01:02.677
Gwaine:
Absolutely. You're outstanding.

01:02.854 --> 01:06.096
Especially when it comes to sweet-talking
the ladies, if nothing else.

01:06.275 --> 01:10.018
Elyan: Don't listen to him.
Percival: No, elyan loves only one woman.

01:10.195 --> 01:11.810
Who? You.

01:11.989 --> 01:13.525
Tell me, I'm your sister.

01:13.699 --> 01:16.190
- Did Arthur not say?
Gwen: Arthur never tells me anything.

01:16.368 --> 01:18.700
But he told you
who Gwaine's in love with

01:18.870 --> 01:20.986
so... all: Ha, ha, ha.

01:51.653 --> 01:52.893
Heh.

02:11.423 --> 02:13.254
\whoal

02:22.392 --> 02:23.723
Gwaine: To the queen.

02:23.894 --> 02:26.180
(Set to the trees. (Go!

03:03.975 --> 03:05.761
Sleep, my lady.

03:06.395 --> 03:09.353
For it could be some time
before you do so again.

03:55.152 --> 03:56.892
Gaius: Merlin, hollyhock.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.774
- One dram?
- And dianthus, two drams.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.813
Merlin: Then what?
Gaius: Three grains.

04:01.992 --> 04:04.074
- What happened?
- We were riding.

04:04.911 --> 04:06.993
We came upon a nest of snakes.

04:08.874 --> 04:10.830
Where's (guinevere?

04:14.796 --> 04:16.878
- Where is she?
Elyan: I told her to get away.

04:17.841 --> 04:19.081
She fled.

04:26.975 --> 04:29.261
Merlin: Arthur!
Arthur: We ride at dawn.

04:38.069 --> 04:40.185
Gaius: This is no accident.

04:40.363 --> 04:41.443
Merlin: Sorcery.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.698
Gaius: There is dark magic
coursing through their veins.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.734
By any right, they should be dead.

04:48.830 --> 04:49.945
They were lucky.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.242
I fear there's more to it than luck.

05:06.223 --> 05:09.340
Arthur: Learn to knock, will you?
- Sorry, sire.

05:10.894 --> 05:13.977
I wanted you to know
that Leon and percival are safe

05:15.065 --> 05:17.727
they are well
on the road to recovery.

05:17.943 --> 05:19.399
That's good news.

05:19.569 --> 05:20.809
Arthur.

05:22.072 --> 05:24.404
There is evidence of sorcery.

05:26.117 --> 05:28.950
(Gaius suspects morgana is involved.

05:32.499 --> 05:33.705
You can go, Merlin.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.378
I lost Guinevere once before.

05:41.132 --> 05:43.373
You're not going to lose her.

05:46.054 --> 05:47.260
You're not.

05:47.430 --> 05:50.092
We will find her. I swear.

05:56.648 --> 05:58.263
We'll bring her home.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.040
Good morning, my lady.

06:19.337 --> 06:20.702
What do you want with me?

06:20.881 --> 06:23.839
- I thought we could play a little game.
- A game?

06:24.509 --> 06:27.125
To find out just how much Arthur loves you.

06:27.304 --> 06:30.296
- It won't work.
- You underestimate his feelings.

06:30.473 --> 06:33.260
He's not stupid. “We'll see

06:33.435 --> 06:36.802
- he'll know you've taken me, that it's a trap.
- He will

06:37.439 --> 06:38.895
but he'll still come.

07:00.295 --> 07:02.911
She must have been knocked
from her mount by some force.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.831
Here! Tracks.

07:08.470 --> 07:10.051
They were heading east.

07:11.848 --> 07:12.883
Let's go.

07:36.957 --> 07:37.957
Here

07:41.628 --> 07:44.085
is it too good for you
now that you're queen?

07:44.673 --> 07:47.039
I don't want anything from you.

07:47.217 --> 07:49.128
Just my crown.

07:50.095 --> 07:51.335
Drink it.

07:51.638 --> 07:53.424
You may need it.

07:53.598 --> 07:57.466
- Why?
- I wouldn't be in such a hurry to know.

08:11.700 --> 08:12.815
Unh!

08:56.077 --> 08:59.786
Percival.: It's getting too dark.
- We'll keep heading east.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.446
Percival: We've lost the trail

09:02.792 --> 09:04.953
then we'll retrace the tracks.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.578
Arthur.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.792
I'll talk to him.

09:22.312 --> 09:23.312
Sire.

09:23.772 --> 09:25.387
She can't be far.

09:25.940 --> 09:27.350
I know.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.270
But we have to work together.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.734
We'll make camp and get a fire going.

09:38.912 --> 09:42.450
In the morning, we'll pick up
her trail again. Come on.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.177
Keep moving.

10:02.352 --> 10:05.344
Where are you taking me?
You'll find out

10:15.740 --> 10:18.573
- What is this place?
- Sleep well.

10:18.743 --> 10:20.074
Morgana!

11:04.706 --> 11:05.706
Arthur: Elyan.

11:08.585 --> 11:11.076
Elyan: If I'd stayed with her...

11:11.379 --> 11:15.543
- You saved percival. You saved Leon.
- But not my own sister.

11:17.594 --> 11:20.711
- We cannot blame ourselves.
- She raised me.

11:22.807 --> 11:24.638
You wouldn't understand.

11:25.977 --> 11:27.217
I do.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.303
I don't know.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.189
What I'd be if it wasn't for her.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.606
Can't explain.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.855
You don't have to.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.630
Merlin: It's all right.
- The tower.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.213
Merlin: It was a dream.

12:02.388 --> 12:06.472
Everything in its shadow was dead,
and the sound, it was like...

12:06.643 --> 12:10.511
Like children screaming.
And the rain that fell was like blood.

12:10.688 --> 12:12.895
I had the same dream.

12:14.776 --> 12:20.066
I was lost in a forest and the trees had
claws, and when I finally escaped it.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.151
There was a plain.

12:22.700 --> 12:30.038
- Empty as far as the eye could see, except...
- Rising into the sky was a black pillar of stone.

12:30.917 --> 12:34.330
A tower so dark it could swallow the sun.

12:34.504 --> 12:36.244
Arthur: The dark tower.

12:39.050 --> 12:42.884
It's a place where every young knight has
taught to dread, and rightly so.

12:43.054 --> 12:46.296
- It's where many have met their end.
- I've never heard of it.

12:46.975 --> 12:48.590
With good reason.

12:49.310 --> 12:53.519
It's said that the mere mention of it
can bring doom to any of those who hear it.

12:56.693 --> 12:59.275
Well, let's not mention it again.

12:59.654 --> 13:03.863
I was having a dream about eating a cheese
that tasted of apple pie.

13:04.242 --> 13:05.948
Anyone else have that dream?

13:07.912 --> 13:09.652
You're all missing out.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.417
Why would they both have that dream?

13:21.050 --> 13:23.757
Poison. Must still be coursing
through their veins.

13:23.928 --> 13:27.045
- But the same dream?
- Arthur, morgana conjured those snakes.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.885
Leon and percival would be dead if that
was what she wanted.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.265
So what are you saying?

13:31.436 --> 13:36.146
She planted those visions
in their minds. It's a trap.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.182
She's luring you to your doom.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.142
At the tower.

13:43.197 --> 13:45.313
That's where she's taken Guinevere.

14:38.419 --> 14:40.660
I've decided to journey to the dark tower.

14:41.923 --> 14:44.335
It's my belief that Guinevere's
been imprisoned there.

14:45.468 --> 14:48.756
I don't know what horrors will be waiting,
so I'll travel alone.

14:48.930 --> 14:50.340
Elyan: No.

14:51.599 --> 14:53.885
I'm sorry. I've made my decision.

14:54.268 --> 14:56.680
You can't stop me, Arthur.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.640
She's my sister.

15:01.818 --> 15:03.604
Percival.: Nor me, Arthur.

15:04.278 --> 15:06.690
- She's our queen.
- And our friend.

15:07.573 --> 15:10.485
She's a maiden in a tower.
Damsel in distress

15:12.245 --> 15:14.156
I was born for this moment.

15:18.668 --> 15:20.829
You can turn back, Merlin.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.956
I made you a promise, remember?

15:52.285 --> 15:53.900
Arthur: The dark tower.

15:55.288 --> 15:58.997
Percival: How do we get to it?
Arthur: Through the impenetrable forest.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.787
But it's impenetrable.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.246
Exactly.

16:03.421 --> 16:06.254
We can't possibly get through there.
“We must.

16:38.915 --> 16:40.371
Keep going.

17:26.087 --> 17:27.292
Heh.

17:38.599 --> 17:39.884
Elyan?

17:53.614 --> 17:55.229
Blunt anyway.

17:56.450 --> 17:59.283
Arthur: Don't stop.
- We've lost the path.

17:59.453 --> 18:00.989
Then we'll keep heading north.

18:01.163 --> 18:04.701
- How do we know which way is north?
- The Ivy.

18:05.459 --> 18:09.418
Pale leaves face south.
Dark leaves face north.

18:31.569 --> 18:34.811
We're on the right course.
We should reach the tower by sundown.

18:34.989 --> 18:36.820
We need to pick up the pace.

18:41.412 --> 18:42.527
Man: Gwen.

18:44.165 --> 18:45.200
Merlin?

19:02.683 --> 19:05.140
Come. Let us have something to eat.

19:18.282 --> 19:20.489
Leon: We should have made it out
of the forest by now.

19:20.743 --> 19:22.233
Arthur: Look.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.279
Leon: What is it?

19:34.382 --> 19:36.088
Elyan: How can that be?

19:36.926 --> 19:39.759
We have gone around in a circle.

19:40.971 --> 19:43.678
We have wasted an entire day!

19:46.018 --> 19:47.633
Let's make camp for the night.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.011
(Set some rest.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.396
And pick up fresh in the morning.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.864
I made you a promise.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.281
Remember?

20:07.998 --> 20:09.579
We will bring her home.

20:19.635 --> 20:21.546
Fat here.

20:21.971 --> 20:24.007
Food always makes me feel better.

20:25.307 --> 20:27.093
Would you prefer some chicken?

20:29.437 --> 20:31.052
You must eat.

20:31.564 --> 20:32.564
You're fading away.

20:33.274 --> 20:38.143
I don't know what cruel trick you're
playing, but I will not be broken by you.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.274
I thought this would be nice.

20:42.074 --> 20:46.363
I know how lonely you must be,
all by yourself in that room.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.614
At least you're not shackled.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.120
And there's daylight.

20:55.045 --> 20:56.660
You can move. You can see.

20:56.839 --> 20:59.205
You expect me to be grateful?

21:00.217 --> 21:02.208
I too have suffered, Gwen.

21:03.179 --> 21:05.636
I spent two years living in darkness.

21:06.807 --> 21:10.140
Spent two years chained to a wall
at the bottom of a pit.

21:14.815 --> 21:16.225
You did not know.

21:22.782 --> 21:26.570
I would have sold my soul for someone
to show me kindness such as this.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.658
If you want me
to take you back up there...

22:34.144 --> 22:37.307
Mab: Welcome to my realm, emrys.

22:39.525 --> 22:40.731
Who are you?

22:40.985 --> 22:42.691
Why, I'm queen mab.

22:42.903 --> 22:45.440
I am the spirit of this place...

22:45.656 --> 22:48.773
And all the places
that bring despair to men's hearts.

22:50.077 --> 22:52.693
Few have ever seen me, emrys.

22:52.872 --> 22:55.204
You should count yourself fortunate.

22:55.958 --> 23:02.454
- You, everything in in this forest, it's bewildering.
- The forest is but one step on the journey.

23:03.632 --> 23:05.463
How do we find a way out?

23:05.634 --> 23:08.671
Oh, little one,
you should not have to ask.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.800
Left is right and right is left.

23:12.016 --> 23:15.224
And the way behind is the way ahead.
It is simple.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.009
Oh. Simple.

23:17.187 --> 23:19.348
You have a mind's eye, emrys.

23:19.523 --> 23:21.935
You must learn to trust in it.

23:24.320 --> 23:26.777
For far greater challenges lie ahead.

23:28.949 --> 23:32.191
When we reach the dark tower?
Ift

23:33.954 --> 23:38.414
- what do you mean?
- You must beware, emrys.

23:38.584 --> 23:40.996
The tower is not a real place.

23:41.170 --> 23:43.161
It is the heart's rest

23:44.173 --> 23:45.879
the mind's deepest fear.

23:46.467 --> 23:49.834
- The stillness in the hummingbird's eye.
- Stop talking in riddles.

23:50.012 --> 23:52.094
Then I shall talk in rhyme.

23:52.264 --> 23:55.131
Heed my words with due concern...

23:55.309 --> 23:57.391
For one of you will not return.

23:58.771 --> 24:00.352
What do you mean?

24:07.780 --> 24:09.316
Which one?

24:44.483 --> 24:47.975
We need to find the clearing
where we saw the dolorous plains.

24:48.153 --> 24:49.814
Which way is that”? North

24:51.907 --> 24:53.989
please. I know I can get us there.

24:54.159 --> 24:57.777
I wouldn't do anything to risk Gwen's life.
I can get us to the dark tower.

24:57.955 --> 24:59.741
I am certain.

25:01.583 --> 25:04.450
I know what Gwen means to you,
to all of us.

25:09.717 --> 25:12.504
- We need to head north.
- Which way is that, Merlin?

25:12.928 --> 25:14.964
That way. Arthur: No, it's...

25:20.644 --> 25:23.477
Over there.
How on earth would you know that?

25:24.648 --> 25:26.434
Sense of smell.

25:27.067 --> 25:29.729
When the wind is from the north,
you can smell the sea.

25:29.903 --> 25:32.144
- That's ridiculous.
- Trust me just this once.

25:33.323 --> 25:34.483
Arthur.

25:35.951 --> 25:38.818
- Give him a chance.
Leon: What choice do we have?

25:52.676 --> 25:54.758
You sure this is the right way, Merlin”?

26:22.623 --> 26:24.033
Percival.: Merlin

26:24.833 --> 26:26.789
you're a genius.

26:35.886 --> 26:37.467
Which way now?

27:23.308 --> 27:26.721
Percival: How far do you think it is”?
- At least we can see where we're going.

27:27.229 --> 27:29.595
Let's not just stand here looking at it.

28:17.279 --> 28:19.941
I thought you might like to dine with me.

28:24.578 --> 28:27.115
Come, you must eat or you'll fade away.

28:44.348 --> 28:46.304
Your hands are cold.

28:46.475 --> 28:49.182
There's a warm fire going for you.

28:49.353 --> 28:52.186
Anything you want, you can have.

28:52.356 --> 28:53.892
I'll give it to you.

28:54.066 --> 28:55.397
Why are you doing this?

28:56.318 --> 28:58.024
Because we're friends.

28:58.654 --> 29:00.360
- We always were.
- I eave me alone.

29:00.781 --> 29:02.066
(Wen.

29:08.247 --> 29:11.455
- What are you trying to do to me?
- I'm helping you.

29:12.251 --> 29:14.913
- I'm looking after you.
- I want nothing from you.

29:19.549 --> 29:21.961
Well, if you change your mind,
let me know.

30:02.634 --> 30:03.919
We can't afford to rest.

30:05.387 --> 30:06.923
Percival.: I'm all right.

30:14.271 --> 30:16.683
Gwen:
Don't look. It'll be all right.

30:17.482 --> 30:19.438
Don't look. It'll be all right.

30:37.544 --> 30:39.660
Don't look. It'll be all right.

31:00.400 --> 31:01.435
Percival.: Merlin!

31:21.713 --> 31:24.170
We must keep moving.

31:29.513 --> 31:31.049
Arthur: Guinevere.

31:32.933 --> 31:33.933
Arthur?

31:39.606 --> 31:40.606
No

31:41.942 --> 31:43.898
I know it's not you.

31:44.277 --> 31:45.277
I know it's not you.

31:45.445 --> 31:47.401
I know it's not you.

31:49.074 --> 31:50.905
I know it's not you.

31:51.993 --> 31:53.824
I know it's not you.

31:55.247 --> 31:56.362
Arthur: Guinevere.

31:56.581 --> 31:59.163
- Look at me.
- I know it's not you.

31:59.334 --> 32:00.790
Arthur: Please.

32:01.044 --> 32:02.909
I know it's not you.

32:03.296 --> 32:05.912
It's me it's Arthur.

32:06.091 --> 32:07.581
I know it's not you.

32:08.427 --> 32:09.427
See?

32:12.222 --> 32:14.463
It's me it's Arthur.

32:14.975 --> 32:16.511
You're safe now.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.825
It's all right.

33:25.337 --> 33:26.952
It's all right.

33:27.130 --> 33:28.586
I'm here.

33:29.883 --> 33:31.714
I'm here.

33:35.805 --> 33:38.387
My darling, it was wrong
to make you suffer.

33:39.476 --> 33:41.057
The mandrake root is cruel.

33:42.395 --> 33:44.260
Pierces the depths of your soul.

33:44.439 --> 33:48.102
Twisting your unconscious
into the very image you fear and dread.

33:49.361 --> 33:52.569
Gwen, you've been so courageous,
but it was necessary.

33:54.282 --> 33:56.523
Gwen, you're not alone now.

33:57.327 --> 33:59.568
You need never be alone again.

34:00.956 --> 34:03.242
I'm the only one you can trust.

34:04.084 --> 34:06.575
I'm all you have left in the world.

34:07.837 --> 34:09.498
The others taunt you.

34:09.797 --> 34:11.208
Hate you.

34:12.467 --> 34:13.706
Come.

34:17.097 --> 34:18.803
You need some rest

34:19.266 --> 34:20.802
some proper rest.

34:27.607 --> 34:28.722
No

34:33.446 --> 34:37.063
Whatever twisted game you're playing,
I want no part in it.

34:37.242 --> 34:39.608
I would rather stay here and die.

35:57.614 --> 35:59.024
Something's wrong.

36:01.534 --> 36:03.399
It's too easy.

36:05.038 --> 36:07.154
Arthur: Are you ever happy?

36:25.684 --> 36:26.684
Arthur!

36:38.863 --> 36:40.569
Aah!

36:45.995 --> 36:47.656
No one move.

36:49.124 --> 36:50.989
Stay exactly where you are.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.371
- What triggered it?
Percival: Unh!

36:55.964 --> 36:58.455
The flagstones.
They must react to pressure.

36:58.967 --> 37:00.127
Elyan: Here

37:01.928 --> 37:03.589
I'll use this.

37:16.359 --> 37:17.940
I'll go first.

37:25.118 --> 37:26.574
I'll push on.

37:27.829 --> 37:29.114
No, elyan.

37:31.875 --> 37:34.457
None of us would even be here
if it wasn't for me.

37:35.003 --> 37:37.210
- I have to do this.
Arthur: Elyan!

37:48.600 --> 37:51.091
- Gwen.
- Elyan.

37:52.145 --> 37:56.354
- What has she done to you?
- No, don't. It will not let you pass.

37:57.567 --> 37:59.899
Morgana has enchanted it
to protect me.

38:00.445 --> 38:03.608
You can't free me, elyan.
Leave me here, please. No.

38:03.782 --> 38:06.694
You cannot overcome it.
It will fight to the death.

38:31.392 --> 38:33.178
Elyan, go! Save yourself.

38:54.958 --> 38:57.449
- Gwen. Unh!
- Elyan?

39:02.131 --> 39:04.167
I'm here I'm here.

39:04.676 --> 39:05.676
I'm here.

39:08.972 --> 39:10.382
For a moment.

39:12.684 --> 39:14.595
I didn't think I was gonna win.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.976
Father would be proud of you.

39:25.530 --> 39:27.191
And of you.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.315
So proud.

41:15.848 --> 41:18.681
Merlin:
I was warned one of us would not return.

41:21.521 --> 41:23.386
It's not your fault, Merlin.

41:24.857 --> 41:26.188
Elyan is dead.

41:26.359 --> 41:31.274
The sword that elyan fell prey to
was surely intended for Arthur.

41:33.366 --> 41:34.981
Now he's safe

41:35.660 --> 41:37.742
and so 1s Gwen.

42:59.243 --> 43:00.733
How is it?

43:02.413 --> 43:04.119
Arthur thinks he's won.

43:04.290 --> 43:05.871
He has no idea.

43:07.335 --> 43:09.792
Do you understand now who you can trust?

43:09.962 --> 43:13.250
It's you, morgana. It's only ever been you.

43:14.092 --> 43:17.584
You're not one of them,
and you never will be.

43:17.762 --> 43:21.630
You don't know how much I hate them,
all of them.

43:22.642 --> 43:25.759
You've done well to see past the lies
to the real truth.

43:25.937 --> 43:28.724
You have an important part
to play in the future.

43:29.315 --> 43:33.103
Together we will ensure the destruction
of everything Arthur holds dear.

43:45.665 --> 43:48.327
Man: Have you noticed
anything about Gwen of late?

43:57.510 --> 43:58.545
Arthur!
