00:45.070 --> 00:47.043
<i>East and West...</i>

00:47.123 --> 00:50.980
<i>...do not mistrust each other
because we're armed.</i>

00:51.060 --> 00:55.285
<i>We're armed because we mistrust each other.</i>

00:55.365 --> 00:56.953
<i>Mr. Gorbachev...</i>

00:57.033 --> 00:59.965
...tear down this wall.

02:10.273 --> 02:13.029
James fucking Gascoigne.

02:13.109 --> 02:14.932
How did you find me?

02:15.612 --> 02:19.302
Maybe you're not as good
at this spy shit as you think.

02:20.282 --> 02:23.998
It was Satchel, wasn't it?
Satchel gave me up.

02:28.125 --> 02:31.781
I always thought, if I got tagged,
it would be by the best.

02:32.661 --> 02:35.148
But you're not the best, are you, Bakhtin?

02:36.666 --> 02:39.553
You're the biggest fucking cunt in the KGB.

02:42.088 --> 02:43.938
Sticks and stones, Jimmy.

07:12.668 --> 07:14.756
That's a nasty black eye.

07:15.805 --> 07:17.127
Where's C?

07:17.207 --> 07:21.096
Given the scale of recent world events,
C will not be joining us.

07:24.081 --> 07:25.899
Yes, of course.

07:34.690 --> 07:36.679
The voices on record are the following...

07:36.759 --> 07:39.928
...myself, Senior Directorate
Officer Eric Gray...

07:40.008 --> 07:44.806
...our American guest, Emmett Kurzfeld
of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency...

07:44.967 --> 07:47.618
...and returning British Operational
Officer Lorraine Broughton.

07:47.698 --> 07:51.161
Before we begin, sir, may I formally
request that Mr. Kurzfeld be removed...

07:51.241 --> 07:53.396
- ...from the debriefing.
- Request denied.

07:53.476 --> 07:55.598
What I have to tell you, sir,
is not for the CIA to hear.

07:55.678 --> 07:58.714
Lorraine, you are the subject
of this debriefing, not...

07:58.794 --> 08:02.218
- I understand that.
- I was there, in Berlin.

08:02.518 --> 08:06.709
And I'm here with the full
executive authority of Langley.

08:06.789 --> 08:11.013
If it'd make you more comfortable, I could
stand behind the mirror with everybody else.

08:11.193 --> 08:13.847
But it's a little crowded back there.

08:16.433 --> 08:17.733
Cocksucker.

08:17.813 --> 08:19.622
What did you say?

08:21.202 --> 08:24.117
- I didn't say anything.
- I'm sorry. Did you say something, Lorraine?

08:24.197 --> 08:26.491
- Did you hear me say something?
- I thought you said something.

08:26.571 --> 08:28.398
What did she say?

08:28.978 --> 08:30.497
What?

08:32.265 --> 08:33.836
Well...

08:34.166 --> 08:36.429
...do you want to play the tape back?

08:44.376 --> 08:46.196
Well, then...

08:47.780 --> 08:49.651
...shall we begin?

08:52.319 --> 08:53.838
Berlin.

08:54.754 --> 08:57.577
- What happened?
- Yeah.

08:58.157 --> 08:59.743
Berlin.

09:04.097 --> 09:05.736
Fuck.

09:14.406 --> 09:17.420
Lorraine. Sorry to bring you in
on such short notice.

09:18.110 --> 09:20.680
- You know C.
- Yes.

09:20.760 --> 09:24.571
We were just going over your file.
I see your Russian is excellent.

09:24.651 --> 09:27.007
An expert in escape and evasion.

09:27.087 --> 09:30.742
Proficient in intelligence collection
and hand-to-hand combat.

09:30.822 --> 09:32.913
It's an impressive set of skills.

09:32.993 --> 09:37.218
Knowing the Reds as I do, she'll need
to use every damn one of them.

09:38.231 --> 09:40.487
I'll get straight to the point.

09:40.567 --> 09:43.154
How well do you know James Gascoigne?

09:43.234 --> 09:46.678
Enough to say hello.
We worked together in Istanbul in '85.

09:46.758 --> 09:48.559
He's dead.

09:50.310 --> 09:53.766
Gascoigne was killed last night
on a mission in Berlin.

09:54.846 --> 09:58.404
The West German Police fished his body
out of the Spree this morning.

09:58.484 --> 10:02.295
And the coroner extracted
a 7.62 Tokarev round...

10:02.375 --> 10:04.912
- ...from the base of his skull.
- Soviets.

10:04.992 --> 10:10.097
Yesterday, Gascoigne met with
a Stasi officer, code-named Spyglass.

10:10.177 --> 10:14.253
We promised Spyglass immunity in
exchange for a document on microfilm...

10:14.333 --> 10:17.908
- ...code-named "the list."
- Hidden in a Swiss watch, no less.

10:17.988 --> 10:23.033
The list contains every active clandestine
officer, all their shady deals.

10:23.113 --> 10:26.058
It's an atomic bomb of information
that could extend the Cold War...

10:26.138 --> 10:28.010
...for another 40 years.

10:28.248 --> 10:31.905
And we believe the man
that killed Gascoigne now has it.

10:32.885 --> 10:36.108
Our sources point to Yuri Bakhtin...

10:36.188 --> 10:40.346
...a KGB hatchet man with more
than a dozen confirmed kills.

10:40.426 --> 10:44.483
- So you want me in Moscow?
- No. Bakhtin never got on the flight.

10:44.563 --> 10:47.377
So he's still in Berlin, along with the list.

10:49.202 --> 10:52.058
Everyone's hunting for it.
The Yanks, the Frogs.

10:52.138 --> 10:54.695
- Soviets, of course.
- And our man, Percival.

10:54.775 --> 10:58.030
- Who's Percival?
- David Percival.

10:58.110 --> 11:00.163
He's our number one in Berlin.

11:01.147 --> 11:03.048
He's your point of contact now.

11:15.763 --> 11:18.716
Straight from the tit of the Virgin Mary.

11:35.781 --> 11:38.939
- The Jordache wasn't easy.
- It's for my wife's birthday.

11:39.019 --> 11:42.075
That's really nice.
Now, where's that fucking list?

11:42.155 --> 11:44.288
I gave the microfilm to Gascoigne last night.

11:44.368 --> 11:48.485
- James didn't show up.
- I did my part. I gave him the list.

11:48.565 --> 11:52.519
You have to get me and my family across.
It's not safe for us anymore here.

11:52.599 --> 11:55.795
- The Russians are onto me.
- No list, no deal.

11:57.770 --> 12:01.727
- I risked everything.
- No list, no deal. You listen to me, Spyglass.

12:01.807 --> 12:05.065
Without that list, why shouldn't I take you
outside and shoot you in the fucking head?

12:05.145 --> 12:09.441
- You are going to kill a Stasi officer?
- One that's about to defect to the West? Yeah.

12:09.881 --> 12:14.186
Without an embassy to look after him,
Percival has gone somewhat native.

12:14.266 --> 12:17.811
Gone fucking feral. Berlin is the Wild West.

12:17.891 --> 12:21.314
If that bloody wall comes crashing down,
we don't want to be under it.

12:21.394 --> 12:25.483
If the Russians get that list,
we're all buggered sideways.

12:27.133 --> 12:28.754
You're Elizabeth Lloyd.

12:28.834 --> 12:31.892
A Cambridge-educated lawyer
sent by James Gascoigne's family...

12:31.972 --> 12:35.162
...to retrieve the body and effects
of their recently deceased son.

12:35.242 --> 12:39.865
Your mission is to connect with Percival and
do whatever it takes to get that list home.

12:39.945 --> 12:42.956
And remember, Lorraine,
this is highly sensitive.

12:43.036 --> 12:45.490
Trust no one.

12:50.722 --> 12:52.826
Follow me! Come, come, come!

12:53.927 --> 12:54.933
Quickly! This way.

12:55.013 --> 12:57.301
- Tell me you made a copy.
- I memorized it.

12:57.381 --> 12:59.853
Memorized it?
Every single agent on that list?

12:59.933 --> 13:03.015
Every Wednesday, you visit the Penny Lane
brothel. Your favorite girl is Margot.

13:03.095 --> 13:06.926
- Her real name is Maria.
- Maria?

13:07.006 --> 13:09.377
- All right, I'll get you across.
- You're a good man, Percival.

13:09.457 --> 13:12.769
Fuck off. I just want the list.
Once I've... Oh, fuck.

13:12.849 --> 13:14.666
- Halt!
- I'll be in touch.

13:17.833 --> 13:20.638
Document. Document. Oh, gee...

14:40.966 --> 14:43.220
Oh, I'm so fucking late.

14:57.616 --> 15:01.105
<i>Welcome to Tempelhof International Airport.</i>

15:26.846 --> 15:29.468
Miss Broughton,
Mr. Percival was running late.

15:29.548 --> 15:31.504
He sent me to pick you up.

15:31.584 --> 15:34.406
- Checked bags?
- No, they've been sent.

15:34.486 --> 15:36.391
Please, follow me.

16:01.780 --> 16:05.271
So... is this your first time in Berlin?

16:05.351 --> 16:06.805
Yes.

16:06.885 --> 16:09.106
Well, it's a remarkable time to be here.

16:11.123 --> 16:14.881
Wonderful music, superb nightlife,
marvelous restaurants.

16:15.261 --> 16:17.750
You must try the Central Cafe for a drink.

16:18.630 --> 16:20.517
You'll need it later.

16:25.504 --> 16:27.982
You remember Mr. Bremovych, don't you?

16:32.312 --> 16:34.165
Of course you do.

16:36.215 --> 16:39.702
Well, he's very curious
what you're doing here in Berlin.

16:45.958 --> 16:47.510
What the fuck are you doing?

17:22.868 --> 17:24.534
What the fuck are you doing?

17:42.682 --> 17:44.935
Welcome to Berlin. I'm David...

17:45.485 --> 17:49.706
- Where the fuck were you?
- Don't shoot. I've got your shoe.

17:53.559 --> 17:55.612
Let me help you with your bags.

17:57.313 --> 17:59.085
Come on.

17:59.165 --> 18:02.622
- Fuck's sake.
- Russians are fucking heavy.

18:03.302 --> 18:05.349
Five minutes on the ground,
and I'm already made.

18:05.429 --> 18:08.054
- You're not made, I hope.
- They knew my name.

18:08.134 --> 18:09.360
- That's troubling.
- And yours.

18:09.440 --> 18:11.261
That's hardly surprising.

18:13.346 --> 18:15.766
Great fucking start, Percival.

18:23.323 --> 18:25.472
So, what was your first impression?

18:25.552 --> 18:28.200
Of David? Well...

18:29.611 --> 18:32.633
...he was handsome. Late 30s.

18:34.034 --> 18:36.755
Disastrous Sinead O'Connor hair.

18:36.835 --> 18:38.191
Irish singer.

18:38.571 --> 18:41.805
I asked him what the deal
was with that, and he said...

18:42.352 --> 18:44.282
"It's to blend in."

18:44.364 --> 18:48.098
Want to touch it?
It's to blend in, in the East.

18:53.632 --> 18:56.291
That was the Brandenburg Gate,
by the way. I mean, how the fuck...

18:56.371 --> 18:59.145
...do the suits think that you're going
to be able to help me find that list?

18:59.225 --> 19:01.809
As soon as you pick up Gascoigne's body,
they'll null and void your visa...

19:01.889 --> 19:05.001
- ...and you'll be on the first flight back home.
- I'll figure it out.

19:05.081 --> 19:07.954
That's Checkpoint Charlie.
My office is just back there.

19:08.034 --> 19:10.789
I'm not here to collect postcards, Percival.

19:10.869 --> 19:13.125
Just drop me at my hotel.
It's around the corner.

19:13.205 --> 19:15.627
I thought you said you'd
never been to Berlin before.

19:15.707 --> 19:17.429
I can read a fucking map.

19:17.509 --> 19:19.797
This will just take a minute.

19:28.653 --> 19:32.275
- What are you doing?
- Sending a message to that fascist pig.

19:37.696 --> 19:39.916
Say hello to Comrade Bremovych for me.

19:55.013 --> 19:56.532
Bremovych...

22:15.871 --> 22:17.709
<i>Tensions are high in East Berlin tonight...</i>

22:17.789 --> 22:20.480
<i>...as civil disobedience
continues to build momentum.</i>

22:20.560 --> 22:24.984
<i>East Berlin's youth leaders shout out their
protests through tear gas and water cannons.</i>

22:25.064 --> 22:29.886
<i>And there are numerous reports of police
beating peaceful demonstrators with batons.</i>

23:02.868 --> 23:06.592
<i>I've been sent to arrange
the return of a British subject.</i>

23:06.672 --> 23:09.095
The body was identified by your attachÃ©.

23:09.175 --> 23:10.929
Yes, I believe so.

23:11.009 --> 23:14.083
This was not a question. It was a statement.

23:20.551 --> 23:23.776
- He was your colleague?
- Different department.

23:23.856 --> 23:26.157
- Which department?
- A different one.

23:28.827 --> 23:30.881
You have the transfer papers?

23:44.243 --> 23:48.501
<i>You know those movies where
the picture just starts to slow down...</i>

23:49.381 --> 23:51.267
<i>...and melt?</i>

23:51.884 --> 23:53.703
Then catch fire?

23:56.221 --> 23:57.808
Well...

23:59.625 --> 24:01.445
...that's Berlin.

24:03.028 --> 24:05.150
<i>The passport number is incorrect.</i>

24:05.230 --> 24:07.886
<i>I will not release this body
without the correct information.</i>

24:07.966 --> 24:09.554
<i>It's a simple mistake.</i>

24:09.634 --> 24:13.057
<i>Miss Lloyd, in Germany,
we don't make simple mistakes.</i>

25:08.777 --> 25:11.433
I'm not going to lie, I'm impressed.

25:12.131 --> 25:14.520
You've got some balls breaking in here.

25:14.600 --> 25:17.617
You should see my balls.
Then you'd be really impressed.

25:17.697 --> 25:21.059
- I'll take your word for it.
- I see you found a way to stay.

25:21.139 --> 25:23.695
You wrote "16" when it should have said "76."

25:23.775 --> 25:26.999
That's right. I'm not going anywhere.

25:27.379 --> 25:30.636
- I'm here for at least another week.
- Lucky fucking me.

25:31.316 --> 25:34.606
They won't release the body now until
they've investigated that red-tape nightmare.

25:34.686 --> 25:36.842
How the fuck did you get in here?

25:36.922 --> 25:40.112
You know, I've been in Berlin a long time,
and I think I know every doorman...

25:40.192 --> 25:44.583
...of every decent shithouse,
borderline decent flophouse...

25:44.663 --> 25:46.284
...both sides of the wall.

25:46.364 --> 25:48.818
Well, then you must know Spyglass.

25:50.068 --> 25:52.057
Never met the fellow.

25:52.137 --> 25:53.856
He was James's.

25:55.706 --> 25:59.395
What do you know about this woman
who's been following me since Tempelhof?

26:00.913 --> 26:04.336
I'd say that you're an attractive woman...

26:04.416 --> 26:06.636
...and you should do the math.

26:08.754 --> 26:13.443
You know, if I was to follow you, I mean,
properly, you'd never fucking know.

26:14.694 --> 26:17.183
There's a knack to it, isn't there?

26:17.263 --> 26:19.986
It's like walking a tightrope
or playing the bagpipes.

26:20.066 --> 26:22.953
You can either do it or you can't.

26:24.869 --> 26:26.755
Knock yourself out.

26:52.732 --> 26:54.655
I'd like to purchase a watch.

26:56.101 --> 26:59.722
I need access to a network in East Berlin.

27:01.923 --> 27:04.193
<i>Come back tomorrow before closing.</i>

27:05.477 --> 27:08.300
<i>East Berlin is on
a short fuse again tonight...</i>

27:08.380 --> 27:12.579
<i>...as Communist Party officials
struggle to maintain order.</i>

27:12.959 --> 27:16.274
- <i>How well do you know James Gascoigne?</i>
- <i>He's dead.</i>

27:16.354 --> 27:18.474
- You need to be careful.
- <i>The coroner extracted a 7.62...</i>

27:18.554 --> 27:21.413
<i>...Tokarev round from the base of his skull.</i>

27:21.493 --> 27:25.182
- <i>Soviets.</i>
- <i>We know who Satchel is.</i>

27:26.831 --> 27:28.318
<i>You need to run.</i>

28:38.304 --> 28:41.389
<i>You expected to find the list
in Gascoigne's apartment.</i>

28:41.469 --> 28:43.988
You realize you were late to the party.

28:44.068 --> 28:48.032
<i>Percival, the Russians... everybody
must have already ransacked the place.</i>

28:48.112 --> 28:49.268
<i>Yes.</i>

28:50.248 --> 28:53.139
But the list wasn't our only problem.

28:54.019 --> 28:57.307
Before I left, he told me one last thing.

28:59.732 --> 29:03.946
This is exactly why
I didn't want the CIA present.

29:07.333 --> 29:09.721
Spyglass revealed that this list...

29:09.801 --> 29:12.872
...would expose a double agent
by the name of Satchel.

29:13.806 --> 29:16.496
I want Satchel, dead or alive.

29:17.076 --> 29:20.168
This traitor has been
a thorn in our side for years.

29:20.248 --> 29:22.501
He's a black eye to the Crown.

29:22.581 --> 29:26.508
And the single biggest
intelligence leak in MI6 history.

29:26.588 --> 29:29.991
You expose this bastard, Satchel...

29:30.621 --> 29:32.712
...and we'll hang him for treason.

29:33.792 --> 29:37.066
You might find yourself
taking tea at Buckingham Palace.

29:37.996 --> 29:39.423
<i>So no...</i>

29:39.503 --> 29:43.119
...I wasn't just looking for the list
in Gascoigne's apartment.

30:04.589 --> 30:08.803
<i>Percival and I seem to have
a different definition for collaboration.</i>

30:10.843 --> 30:12.904
<i>What's that supposed to mean?</i>

30:12.984 --> 30:16.689
He was the only one who knew
I was going to Gascoigne's apartment.

30:17.469 --> 30:21.174
And if I knew he was going to call the
police, I would've worn a different outfit.

30:28.680 --> 30:30.566
Different outfit?

32:19.657 --> 32:21.743
Hey! Halt!

32:49.974 --> 32:52.110
<i>With repeated calls
for change on the streets...</i>

32:52.190 --> 32:54.512
<i>...and the protesters growing
ever more confident...</i>

32:54.592 --> 32:57.483
<i>...time is running out
for the East German government.</i>

32:57.563 --> 33:01.052
<i>Popular opinion has it that the
Communists' claim to leadership...</i>

33:01.132 --> 33:02.954
<i>...can't be upheld much longer.</i>

33:03.034 --> 33:07.293
<i>And if rapid change is not forthcoming,
today's relatively calm protests...</i>

33:07.373 --> 33:10.429
<i>...could be seen as the calm
before the storm.</i>

33:11.609 --> 33:14.199
<i>It's not just new faces
that are called for...</i>

33:14.279 --> 33:17.325
<i>...but perhaps a complete
demolition of the wall.</i>

33:44.809 --> 33:46.629
Let me take your coat.

33:54.352 --> 33:56.238
Make yourself at home.

34:03.595 --> 34:05.449
Fucking hell.

34:07.632 --> 34:10.652
You want a pair of jeans? Help yourself.

34:23.882 --> 34:26.570
Your library includes Larry Flynt?

34:27.685 --> 34:29.579
Champion of free speech.

34:34.426 --> 34:36.413
What have you found on Bakhtin?

34:36.493 --> 34:41.053
If Bakhtin wanted the Russians to have that
list, he would've given it to them by now.

34:41.132 --> 34:43.888
We just have to wait
for him to make his move.

34:43.967 --> 34:46.725
We can't afford to wait.
This is your city, Percival.

34:46.804 --> 34:50.226
Or do you only know doormen and bellhops?

34:55.179 --> 34:57.735
So, what did you find
in Gascoigne's apartment?

34:57.815 --> 34:59.971
Some Deutsche Marks...

35:00.051 --> 35:02.474
...empty passports, travel visas...

35:02.554 --> 35:06.443
...and a picture of the two of you
together a few years back.

35:10.728 --> 35:12.783
Did I not mention that we were friends?

35:12.863 --> 35:15.918
- No.
- No? No, I must have forgot to.

35:20.939 --> 35:22.861
Get your coat, love.

35:22.941 --> 35:24.760
We're going for a walk.

35:31.583 --> 35:34.202
Look, we're all exposed by that list.

35:34.620 --> 35:39.063
And saving the world is cool and all that,
but my main objective is staying alive.

35:39.143 --> 35:40.712
I've been head
of Berlin Station for 10 years.

35:40.792 --> 35:43.949
You've got to know that I'm the only man
in this town that can help you get that list.

35:44.029 --> 35:48.018
Yes, I've read your file.
I've also read your dog file.

35:48.098 --> 35:50.504
So let's cut the crap, shall we?

35:50.968 --> 35:54.590
This whole hungover, show-up-late,
don't-know-which-way-is-up act...

35:54.670 --> 35:56.627
...I'm not buying it.

35:56.707 --> 35:59.731
I trust you about as far as I can throw you.

35:59.811 --> 36:02.134
"It's a double pleasure
to deceive the deceiver."

36:02.214 --> 36:04.267
Niccolo Machiavelli.

36:05.417 --> 36:09.840
- It was on your shelf.
- Oh, my God, I think I fucking love you.

36:09.920 --> 36:11.807
That's too bad.

36:12.853 --> 36:16.548
If Percival was telling
the truth about Bakhtin...

36:16.628 --> 36:19.516
...I needed to figure out
what the Russians knew.

36:56.767 --> 36:58.620
Stoli on ice.

37:26.165 --> 37:28.453
I'm not speaking German tonight.

37:29.533 --> 37:31.386
So, you're British?

37:36.506 --> 37:38.394
Very impressive.

37:39.477 --> 37:41.764
This can't be your only talent.

37:43.181 --> 37:45.414
Talents can be overrated.

37:46.250 --> 37:47.838
A dedication...

37:47.918 --> 37:50.534
...a loyalty is very rare these days.

37:56.795 --> 37:59.816
Everyone here is searching for something.

38:01.215 --> 38:03.105
What are you looking for?

38:03.735 --> 38:06.725
Well, when all's said and done,
wouldn't you say deep down...

38:06.805 --> 38:10.027
...we're all just searching
for the same thing?

38:17.181 --> 38:20.725
I leave you alone for only a moment,
and already you are attracting admirers.

38:21.585 --> 38:24.608
<i>Monsieur</i>, three is not always a crowd...

38:24.688 --> 38:27.108
...but tonight it is.

38:27.843 --> 38:29.729
French women.

38:31.929 --> 38:33.731
What about the British?

38:34.331 --> 38:37.419
Maybe we could make
some sort of arrangement.

38:39.203 --> 38:43.408
We haven't seen each other in a long time,
and we really need to catch up.

38:44.742 --> 38:46.331
Alone.

38:47.111 --> 38:50.212
Ladies, Berlin is a small place.

38:50.682 --> 38:53.336
I'm sure our paths will cross again.

39:04.563 --> 39:08.018
Sorry. You looked like you needed saving.

39:10.268 --> 39:13.092
Well, I appreciate the gesture, Miss...

39:13.412 --> 39:15.961
Lasalle. Delphine Lasalle.

39:16.741 --> 39:18.561
Pleased to meet you.

39:20.411 --> 39:22.901
So, what do you do, Delphine?

39:22.981 --> 39:25.904
I'm a part-time translator
who really wants to be a poet.

39:25.984 --> 39:27.757
Maybe a rock star.

39:32.791 --> 39:36.203
My friend owns a club nearby.
Want to come check it out?

39:36.283 --> 39:38.747
- Now?
- Sure.

39:39.598 --> 39:41.452
I can't.

39:41.932 --> 39:44.760
Well, I'll give you the address anyway.

39:45.185 --> 39:47.240
Come meet me there tomorrow night?

39:49.973 --> 39:51.794
Will you come?

39:52.627 --> 39:54.182
Maybe?

39:54.462 --> 39:56.351
You're relentless.

39:57.081 --> 39:58.633
<i>Oui.</i>

40:00.886 --> 40:03.008
David Hasselhoff's in town.

40:03.088 --> 40:04.976
Lucky us.

40:05.556 --> 40:07.423
Berlin is truly doomed.

40:28.280 --> 40:30.135
Your watch is ready.

40:31.115 --> 40:33.802
It's on the counter in that plain envelope.

40:42.526 --> 40:44.947
I think you'll find my contact very useful.

40:57.475 --> 40:59.319
<i>Your watch is ready.</i>

41:00.479 --> 41:03.131
<i>It's on the counter in that plain envelope.</i>

41:04.933 --> 41:07.354
<i>I think you'll find my contact very useful.</i>

41:09.353 --> 41:12.978
<i>East Berliners stormed the West
German embassies in Czechoslovakia...</i>

41:13.058 --> 41:16.814
<i>...earlier this week, as the Czech government
has begun to wave the refugees...</i>

41:16.894 --> 41:19.050
<i>...through checkpoints with few questions.</i>

41:19.130 --> 41:22.986
<i>One has to ask how long the East
Berlin government can hold on...</i>

41:43.542 --> 41:46.794
<i>Bakhtin and the list
had not yet surfaced in the West.</i>

41:47.892 --> 41:52.147
<i>I needed to meet my new contact
and see what I was up against in the East.</i>

41:59.603 --> 42:02.457
You should have applied
for a visitor's permit.

42:03.573 --> 42:06.595
- What kind of work do you do?
- Legal affairs.

42:15.018 --> 42:17.505
If you do not return before 6:00...

42:17.585 --> 42:20.176
...you will be arrested. Do you understand?

42:21.391 --> 42:23.244
I understand.

42:29.750 --> 42:32.856
Right now I'm not feeling very confident
about this story of yours.

42:33.636 --> 42:36.925
Why not use Percival's
connections in the East?

42:37.776 --> 42:39.616
<i>He told me...</i>

42:40.479 --> 42:42.498
<i>...to trust no one.</i>

42:46.151 --> 42:47.670
Hello?

43:51.098 --> 43:52.935
Go there.

46:52.230 --> 46:54.084
You are late.

46:54.164 --> 46:56.220
And you were followed.

46:56.300 --> 46:58.856
I'm late because I was followed.

46:58.936 --> 47:02.459
I lost them 20 minutes ago
near the Palast der Republik.

47:02.539 --> 47:04.762
You're as good as your reputation.

47:05.342 --> 47:07.392
Are you sure this is the best place to meet?

47:08.846 --> 47:10.733
Keep your enemies close.

47:11.915 --> 47:14.402
I'm a permanent fixture for them now.

47:16.254 --> 47:19.744
The Watchmaker says there has
been great interest in this list...

47:19.824 --> 47:22.890
- ...on the black market the last few days.
- Any sign of Bakhtin?

47:22.970 --> 47:24.514
No.

47:24.594 --> 47:28.553
This Satchel character has people
worried on both sides of the wall.

47:28.633 --> 47:30.155
Yeah.

47:30.935 --> 47:33.524
What kind of network have you assembled?

47:33.604 --> 47:36.527
There's a lot of... dissatisfied youth...

47:36.607 --> 47:38.461
...on this side of the wall.

47:42.246 --> 47:44.101
They're like a...

47:44.581 --> 47:46.150
...tinderbox.

47:47.384 --> 47:49.403
If you find the right spark...

47:51.822 --> 47:53.676
Keep talking.

48:31.862 --> 48:34.818
I am interested in selling a watch.

48:34.898 --> 48:36.921
What are you selling?

48:37.501 --> 48:39.523
It is extremely valuable.

48:40.003 --> 48:42.060
Finest quality and...

48:42.240 --> 48:44.260
...filled with secrets.

48:52.717 --> 48:55.403
Would you mind if I inspect the merchandise?

48:57.788 --> 49:00.011
Fuck yes, I mind.

49:01.391 --> 49:06.481
Just tell potential buyers
Bakhtin is open for business.

49:21.895 --> 49:24.930
<i>Ladies, Berlin is a small place.</i>

49:25.549 --> 49:27.970
<i>I'm sure our paths will cross again.</i>

49:31.688 --> 49:35.175
<i>Sorry. You looked like you needed saving.</i>

49:36.726 --> 49:41.082
<i>My friend owns a club nearby.
Want to come check it out?</i>

50:00.750 --> 50:02.970
I didn't think that you would show.

50:05.622 --> 50:07.474
Stoli on the rocks?

50:09.427 --> 50:11.247
You pay attention.

50:13.898 --> 50:16.182
I look for pleasure in the details.

50:21.873 --> 50:24.094
Speaking of which...

50:24.174 --> 50:27.060
...I have been dying to ask you a question.

50:39.457 --> 50:41.343
Let's go someplace quiet.

51:03.881 --> 51:06.545
Why the gun, Delphine?

51:08.885 --> 51:11.775
You're not as well-disguised
as you may think.

51:11.855 --> 51:15.680
I know who you are.
You're Lorraine Broughton, MI6...

51:15.760 --> 51:18.980
...and you're here because
of the death of Gascoigne.

51:20.297 --> 51:22.784
What do you know about Gascoigne?

51:25.136 --> 51:26.656
Nothing.

51:26.936 --> 51:31.030
But if someone is killing Allied officers,
shouldn't we all care?

51:34.544 --> 51:38.000
Whatever is in that list
has people willing to kill for it.

51:50.761 --> 51:53.785
This is my first assignment
with the French intelligence.

51:54.465 --> 51:56.485
I've only been here a year.

51:58.736 --> 52:02.793
I'm scared, okay?
I got into this because it was exciting.

52:03.773 --> 52:06.061
But it's never been like this in Berlin.

52:09.079 --> 52:11.166
You should have become a poet.

52:15.519 --> 52:17.406
Or a rock star.

53:16.179 --> 53:18.468
<i>So you made contact
with the French operative?</i>

53:18.548 --> 53:20.068
<i>Obviously.</i>

53:22.419 --> 53:23.536
<i>Why?</i>

53:23.616 --> 53:27.097
I believed she had information
I could exploit.

53:27.177 --> 53:29.012
Nothing more.

53:29.342 --> 53:30.675
And did she?

53:35.318 --> 53:37.719
Did she have any information, Lorraine?

53:41.706 --> 53:43.926
There is something I need to tell you.

53:47.878 --> 53:50.733
It has to do with your friend
Percival. He's...

54:03.260 --> 54:04.413
Lorraine?

54:06.931 --> 54:09.417
Did she have any information, Lorraine?

54:13.438 --> 54:15.926
Did she give you information?

54:17.206 --> 54:18.693
She gave me nothing.

54:27.550 --> 54:29.970
David fucking Percival.

54:33.156 --> 54:35.544
Are you following me?

54:35.624 --> 54:38.778
Maybe you're not as good
at this spy shit as you think.

54:42.966 --> 54:45.523
That was for James, you fucking prick.

54:45.603 --> 54:47.856
Now, give me that fucking list.

55:09.126 --> 55:11.416
<i>We needed to get you a message, Lorraine.</i>

55:12.496 --> 55:15.359
We're several days into a mission
without a single lead.

55:15.439 --> 55:17.455
And plenty of distractions.

55:18.235 --> 55:20.925
You have to be reminded
of the course at hand.

55:21.005 --> 55:23.025
I received your message.

55:37.220 --> 55:39.110
That's quite a view.

55:39.590 --> 55:43.195
70 miles of barbed wire, 310 guard towers...

55:43.275 --> 55:46.249
...65 anti-vehicle trenches...

55:46.329 --> 55:51.355
...40,000 Soviet-trained,
heavily armed frontier troops.

55:51.435 --> 55:53.266
All that...

55:53.764 --> 55:58.027
...and 5,000 GDR citizens
still had the brass balls to escape.

56:00.177 --> 56:04.599
You've got the MI6 so worried,
they called the CIA to talk sense into you.

56:06.984 --> 56:09.039
Eric Gray called me.

56:10.119 --> 56:11.676
Of course he did.

56:11.756 --> 56:14.875
I don't have to remind you
of how fast the clock is ticking.

56:14.955 --> 56:19.530
If this thing gets out,
a lot of good, hard-working folks...

56:19.930 --> 56:22.953
...brave men and women
are going to show up dead.

56:23.433 --> 56:25.523
You and I included.

56:25.903 --> 56:29.925
I swear to God, the last few weeks,
I dread even waking up in the morning.

56:33.110 --> 56:35.599
I understand the severity
of the situation, sir.

56:35.679 --> 56:37.698
And the time imperative.

56:39.582 --> 56:43.623
Listen, I didn't climb all the way up here
just to give you some rousing pep talk.

56:44.735 --> 56:46.910
So I'll cut to the chase.

56:46.990 --> 56:49.546
Last night, you met a woman.

56:49.626 --> 56:53.417
Delphine Lasalle is out of her depth.

56:53.497 --> 56:56.836
Given the climate, I'd hate to see
an executive order come down the line...

56:56.916 --> 56:59.124
...that falls in her disinterest.

57:00.504 --> 57:02.327
Her disinterest?

57:03.007 --> 57:05.028
What do you mean, her disinterest?

57:05.108 --> 57:09.199
Don't insult my intelligence, Lorraine.
You know exactly what I fucking mean.

57:10.329 --> 57:12.502
Hope you get a snapshot.

57:12.582 --> 57:15.437
Next week, this will be
a whole different picture.

57:24.827 --> 57:27.281
<i>Central has been compromised.</i>

58:32.596 --> 58:35.918
<i>Meet me at the Rough
Trade Bar at Oranienstrasse.</i>

58:35.998 --> 58:37.851
<i>We need to talk.</i>

58:52.950 --> 58:55.124
Look at all these hedonists.

58:55.204 --> 58:58.839
It's like a beautiful woman
gone wrong. I fucking love it.

59:00.623 --> 59:02.880
Word is Bakhtin has resurfaced.

59:02.960 --> 59:05.182
Cops found him with a homemade lobotomy.

59:05.262 --> 59:07.984
Either way, we have to deal with Spyglass.

59:08.064 --> 59:10.553
Thinking it through, he doesn't
have much time over there.

59:10.633 --> 59:13.441
Our priority is the list.
We can't make mistakes.

59:13.521 --> 59:16.594
Come on. He's hardly the most
trustworthy person I ever met.

59:16.674 --> 59:20.281
- Or the fucking brightest.
- Wait. You said you hadn't met him.

59:23.547 --> 59:25.415
I lied.

59:26.115 --> 59:29.937
And he claims to have
memorized the entire list.

59:31.420 --> 59:33.510
He's ready to make the jump.

59:33.990 --> 59:36.713
You believe he committed
the entire thing to memory?

59:36.793 --> 59:38.317
Everything.

59:39.597 --> 59:42.920
Had I known earlier,
I would have prioritized Spyglass.

59:43.500 --> 59:46.370
His knowledge made him
as valuable as the list.

59:47.438 --> 59:51.429
I could have grabbed him at any moment.
Instead, Percival kept it a secret...

59:51.509 --> 59:53.995
...putting us in a precarious position.

01:00:00.984 --> 01:00:04.975
The KGB are going to have some very angry
bastards out there looking for Spyglass.

01:00:05.055 --> 01:00:07.644
We can't trust any of the old usual methods.

01:00:07.724 --> 01:00:10.181
It's not that difficult to drive
across the border these days.

01:00:10.261 --> 01:00:12.916
It is when you're wanted like Spyglass is.

01:00:13.496 --> 01:00:17.988
We have to walk him across personally
to ensure his safety in plain sight.

01:00:18.468 --> 01:00:20.389
We'll use the demonstration
tomorrow at Alexanderplatz.

01:00:20.469 --> 01:00:22.352
- That's insane.
- All those protesters...

01:00:22.432 --> 01:00:24.460
...will make a great distraction.

01:00:26.810 --> 01:00:29.351
Spyglass is my guy.
We're going to do it my way.

01:00:31.747 --> 01:00:36.005
Fine. But we use my contact
to get all our papers in order.

01:00:36.475 --> 01:00:38.308
All right.

01:00:39.188 --> 01:00:41.274
We have a deal?

01:00:43.593 --> 01:00:45.414
I'll take that as a yes.

01:00:53.169 --> 01:00:54.973
You see...

01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:01.929
...I received a call from David Percival
that evening, Lorraine.

01:01:08.518 --> 01:01:11.507
He said he had the list.

01:01:11.587 --> 01:01:14.040
I'll need a little time to wrap it up.

01:01:15.258 --> 01:01:17.744
<i>And he knew the identity of Satchel.</i>

01:01:19.896 --> 01:01:21.949
I'm very close to Satchel.

01:01:43.119 --> 01:01:45.174
And no one thought to tell me?

01:01:54.897 --> 01:01:56.484
Fuck.

01:02:02.439 --> 01:02:04.526
You brought a lot of friends.

01:02:05.175 --> 01:02:08.030
I heard Bakhtin had a little accident.

01:02:08.110 --> 01:02:10.933
I heard he slipped and fell on an ice pick.

01:02:11.013 --> 01:02:14.905
- Berlin's a cruel mistress.
- Especially for traitors like Bakhtin.

01:02:14.985 --> 01:02:17.607
Don't be such a fucking Communist.
You've got a problem.

01:02:17.687 --> 01:02:20.941
Yeah, I know. You have the fucking list.

01:02:22.992 --> 01:02:25.449
We've been in the trenches long enough
to know that at times like this...

01:02:25.529 --> 01:02:27.917
...Berlin has its own set of rules.

01:02:27.997 --> 01:02:31.254
I can give you information
that will keep the balance.

01:02:31.924 --> 01:02:34.788
Now, are you in or out?

01:02:42.179 --> 01:02:44.266
Percival's trying to set me up.

01:02:48.452 --> 01:02:50.271
Are you surprised?

01:02:52.004 --> 01:02:53.826
Not really.

01:02:53.956 --> 01:02:58.046
These relationships aren't real.
They're just a means to an end.

01:03:01.431 --> 01:03:04.053
When you tell the truth, you look different.

01:03:04.233 --> 01:03:06.087
Your eyes change.

01:03:07.236 --> 01:03:09.089
Thanks for the warning.

01:03:11.808 --> 01:03:15.429
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I better not do it again.

01:03:21.151 --> 01:03:22.704
Why?

01:03:26.456 --> 01:03:29.110
'Cause it's going to get me killed one day.

01:04:48.472 --> 01:04:53.146
Well, I am impressed. I thought Merkel
here was just a good bartender.

01:05:03.686 --> 01:05:06.106
You smell like a Stasi officer.

01:05:08.826 --> 01:05:13.082
Shave off that moustache. Use that
soap and cologne. It's from the West.

01:05:13.162 --> 01:05:16.840
- You can't take anything from the East.
- Merkel will give you some clothes.

01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:19.587
Right this way, Mr. Spyglass.

01:05:57.107 --> 01:05:58.995
It should have been easy.

01:05:59.775 --> 01:06:04.653
The plan was sound. Whatever went wrong
did so because someone wanted it to.

01:06:04.733 --> 01:06:08.537
- Someone from the inside.
- Were you betrayed by a fellow agent?

01:06:08.617 --> 01:06:10.440
You mean Satchel?

01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:12.840
Would that be unheard of?

01:06:14.089 --> 01:06:15.943
Per your request.

01:06:21.431 --> 01:06:25.487
You won't be needing that.
It will be worse if they find it on you.

01:06:27.269 --> 01:06:31.160
- Everything else ready?
- Yes. Everything you requested.

01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:32.464
I'm ready.

01:06:36.313 --> 01:06:38.601
What do you think of his shirt?

01:06:39.181 --> 01:06:41.438
I wouldn't be caught dead in it.

01:06:41.718 --> 01:06:43.973
But for him, it's perfect.

01:06:44.053 --> 01:06:45.940
Stand over here.

01:06:48.123 --> 01:06:50.210
Now look like a free man.

01:06:54.231 --> 01:06:58.189
<i>East Berlin peace leaders have
organized a demonstration this week...</i>

01:06:58.269 --> 01:07:00.354
<i>...at Alexanderplatz.</i>

01:07:04.641 --> 01:07:07.729
Did he tell you I memorized the whole list?

01:07:09.146 --> 01:07:10.731
Yes.

01:07:12.015 --> 01:07:15.459
I realize I may not be
as valuable to some people and...

01:07:15.539 --> 01:07:18.340
...some people may even want me dead, but...

01:07:20.923 --> 01:07:22.744
...what choice do I have?

01:07:24.527 --> 01:07:29.388
You're no good to me dead.
And I've never lost a package.

01:07:31.434 --> 01:07:33.314
I know.

01:07:38.975 --> 01:07:42.030
Hey, hey, hey. It's his family.

01:07:43.847 --> 01:07:47.335
- This was not part of the plan.
- Part of mine.

01:07:49.252 --> 01:07:50.824
Please.

01:07:51.254 --> 01:07:54.916
I'll take the wife and kid.
You just have to deal with Spyglass.

01:07:56.259 --> 01:07:58.513
I don't know if I have enough passports.

01:07:59.695 --> 01:08:01.218
<i>Percival.</i>

01:08:01.498 --> 01:08:03.695
<i>Your old golden boy.</i>

01:08:36.098 --> 01:08:37.622
We have to go.

01:08:41.569 --> 01:08:44.344
See you in the West. Good luck.

01:09:39.662 --> 01:09:43.117
- This was never part of the plan.
- It was part of mine.

01:10:36.386 --> 01:10:38.204
Stay low.

01:10:44.693 --> 01:10:46.580
In here.

01:10:50.033 --> 01:10:53.320
I need to deal with this now,
or we'll never get across.

01:10:57.674 --> 01:11:00.897
- I don't want to die.
- You're not going to die.

01:11:00.977 --> 01:11:02.830
Stay here.

01:13:58.887 --> 01:14:00.398
Fuck.

01:14:13.502 --> 01:14:15.956
Two more. There's two more.

01:14:59.949 --> 01:15:01.468
Go.

01:15:05.721 --> 01:15:07.709
You need to stop that bleeding.

01:15:07.789 --> 01:15:11.811
Search for anything. Alcohol, rags.

01:17:47.616 --> 01:17:49.636
Am I a bitch now?

01:18:40.268 --> 01:18:42.121
Get in.

01:18:42.739 --> 01:18:44.625
Get in!

01:18:52.014 --> 01:18:54.301
You need to work on your German.

01:18:57.819 --> 01:18:59.673
It's horrible.

01:19:01.991 --> 01:19:03.810
What the hell?

01:19:52.641 --> 01:19:54.508
Fasten your seat belt.

01:20:42.824 --> 01:20:46.017
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:20:46.827 --> 01:20:48.347
We have to go...

01:21:01.742 --> 01:21:03.828
- It's so cold!
- Open your door.

01:21:03.908 --> 01:21:06.733
My foot is... it's stuck!

01:21:15.857 --> 01:21:17.677
Just breathe.

01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:34.522
- You need a break?
- No.

01:22:42.877 --> 01:22:44.411
So...

01:22:45.581 --> 01:22:49.105
...yes, I think I understand everything.
You made your plan.

01:22:49.385 --> 01:22:52.474
And you failed to get the high-value asset...

01:22:52.554 --> 01:22:54.376
...safely across to the West.

01:22:54.456 --> 01:22:57.111
You sent me into a fucking hornet's nest.

01:22:59.295 --> 01:23:02.919
I was made by the KGB from the moment
my feet touched the ground.

01:23:02.999 --> 01:23:04.851
Maybe even before.

01:23:06.668 --> 01:23:09.157
But then you knew that, didn't you?

01:23:09.237 --> 01:23:12.061
You had your doubts about Percival...

01:23:12.841 --> 01:23:15.842
...and you used me to shake him down.

01:23:16.579 --> 01:23:18.598
Ready when you are.

01:23:37.332 --> 01:23:39.121
Hey, hey.

01:23:39.201 --> 01:23:41.221
It's me. It's me.

01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:55.716
He's dead. Spyglass is dead.

01:23:58.553 --> 01:24:00.439
And you are alive.

01:24:02.690 --> 01:24:04.544
They're all listening to me.

01:24:08.062 --> 01:24:09.915
They knew.

01:24:10.331 --> 01:24:12.642
The KGB knew everything.

01:24:14.035 --> 01:24:16.055
I need to get across.

01:24:17.806 --> 01:24:19.393
Jan.

01:25:01.382 --> 01:25:04.456
Well, I expected more out of the Brits
than a royal goat fuck.

01:25:04.536 --> 01:25:08.809
I know. We're sorry. No, wait. You lot don't
have your own private Stasi agent, do you?

01:25:08.889 --> 01:25:11.677
Not one with a photographic memory.

01:25:19.601 --> 01:25:22.249
<i>We need to get with Broughton
and get on the same page.</i>

01:25:22.329 --> 01:25:24.808
<i>We need that list... now more than ever.</i>

01:25:26.641 --> 01:25:27.950
Broughton?

01:25:28.677 --> 01:25:30.457
She made it out.

01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:33.865
Right.

01:25:35.450 --> 01:25:38.941
You know, a beautiful Italian
girl once said to me, "David...

01:25:40.421 --> 01:25:42.831
...you can't unfuck what's been fucked."

01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:48.047
Women are always getting
in the way of progress, aren't they?

01:25:51.216 --> 01:25:54.221
<i>What no one in Germany believed
possible has happened tonight.</i>

01:25:54.301 --> 01:25:56.959
<i>The wall is coming down. The wall is down.</i>

01:25:57.039 --> 01:26:00.295
<i>People here have lived
with the wall since 1961...</i>

01:26:00.375 --> 01:26:04.590
<i>...and I think now it's time to...
break the wall down, you know.</i>

01:26:04.670 --> 01:26:06.534
<i>The wall is crumbling.</i>

01:26:06.614 --> 01:26:12.040
<i>The sledgehammers in the hands of men
not born when it went up tear into it.</i>

01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:16.412
<i>And behind it, the East German
soldiers tried to stop the tide.</i>

01:26:16.492 --> 01:26:20.548
<i>Water cannons were brought out.
But the West Berliners were determined.</i>

01:26:20.628 --> 01:26:22.951
<i>One West Berliner sprayed champagne back.</i>

01:26:23.031 --> 01:26:26.519
<i>You know, if I was to follow you,
I mean, properly...</i>

01:26:27.335 --> 01:26:29.013
<i>...you'd never fucking know.</i>

01:26:29.603 --> 01:26:33.661
<i>It is the moment Berliners
have waited 28 years for.</i>

01:26:33.741 --> 01:26:35.864
<i>Even the East Germans seem exhilarated.</i>

01:26:35.944 --> 01:26:39.751
<i>A symbolic breach in the structure
that cost hundreds of lives...</i>

01:26:39.831 --> 01:26:44.473
<i>...and separated friends,
families and lovers for decades.</i>

01:26:44.553 --> 01:26:49.387
I found a French UHF device
in my coat after Spyglass died.

01:26:50.592 --> 01:26:53.081
I now believe it was Percival who planted it.

01:26:53.161 --> 01:26:55.249
Made it look like Lasalle.

01:27:17.987 --> 01:27:19.840
Why are you here?

01:27:21.457 --> 01:27:23.743
You need to leave Berlin.

01:27:25.426 --> 01:27:28.203
Well, when I didn't hear from you,
I got worried.

01:27:28.296 --> 01:27:30.317
How naive can you be?

01:27:31.567 --> 01:27:33.787
We chose this life, Delphine.

01:27:35.436 --> 01:27:38.558
- This only ends one way.
- What are you talking about?

01:27:43.094 --> 01:27:45.069
He set us both up.

01:27:45.149 --> 01:27:47.399
You have to leave while you can.

01:28:13.307 --> 01:28:15.997
- <i>Yes?</i>
- Don't underestimate me, Percival.

01:28:16.077 --> 01:28:20.396
<i>Lasalle, listen to me very carefully.
You have no idea who you're dealing with.</i>

01:28:20.476 --> 01:28:23.973
- <i>You set me up.</i>
- You... come on. This is the game.

01:28:24.053 --> 01:28:29.474
<i>I know your secrets, David, and I can
play this game better than you think.</i>

01:29:21.408 --> 01:29:24.500
<i>Percival is trying to set me up.</i>

01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:28.403
- <i>Are you surprised?</i>
- <i>Not really.</i>

01:29:28.483 --> 01:29:32.509
<i>These relationships aren't real.
They're just a means to an end.</i>

01:29:33.989 --> 01:29:36.612
<i>When you tell the truth, you look different.</i>

01:29:36.892 --> 01:29:40.180
- <i>Your eyes change.</i>
- <i>Thanks for the warning.</i>

01:29:42.898 --> 01:29:46.587
- <i>What do you mean?</i>
- <i>I mean, I better not do it again.</i>

01:29:46.967 --> 01:29:48.223
<i>Why?</i>

01:29:48.303 --> 01:29:50.957
<i>'Cause it's going to get me killed one day.</i>

01:29:55.476 --> 01:29:57.930
<i>There is something that I need to tell you.</i>

01:30:06.321 --> 01:30:09.375
<i>It has to do with
your friend Percival. He's...</i>

01:31:44.218 --> 01:31:46.104
I'm sorry, darling.

01:31:48.155 --> 01:31:49.976
This is the game.

01:32:41.358 --> 01:32:42.899
Fuck.

01:32:44.379 --> 01:32:46.767
<i>Celebrations continue in the streets tonight.</i>

01:32:46.847 --> 01:32:49.904
<i>From the moment the first wave
of East Germans crossed into Berlin...</i>

01:32:49.984 --> 01:32:54.009
<i>...they have been showered with champagne
and cheered by a crowd of thousands.</i>

01:32:54.089 --> 01:32:57.979
<i>It is clear this will be one
of Berlin's most dramatic days.</i>

01:32:58.059 --> 01:33:00.749
<i>East Berliners are overcome
as they cross the border...</i>

01:33:00.829 --> 01:33:03.118
<i>...that has been closed to them for 28 years.</i>

01:33:03.198 --> 01:33:07.737
<i>West Berliners are chipping away at the wall
that scarred their city and scaling it.</i>

01:33:23.817 --> 01:33:26.274
<i>There is no more interference
from the police.</i>

01:33:26.354 --> 01:33:28.877
<i>Unified, Berliners lay symbols of peace.</i>

01:33:28.957 --> 01:33:32.569
<i>Thousands of them looking east
and chanting, "Down with the wall."</i>

01:33:55.682 --> 01:33:58.303
There's only one question left to ask.

01:33:59.955 --> 01:34:01.776
Who won?

01:34:01.956 --> 01:34:04.444
And what was the fucking game anyway?

01:34:05.711 --> 01:34:08.817
<i>And I was thinking, the wall will never fall.</i>

01:34:08.897 --> 01:34:13.388
<i>Germany's peaceful revolution is probably
the political and cultural story of 1989.</i>

01:34:13.468 --> 01:34:16.658
<i>We're going to take a break, but we'll be back
with an in-depth look at the number-one...</i>

01:34:16.738 --> 01:34:20.995
<i>...musical controversy of the year, sampling.
Is it art, or is it just plagiarism?</i>

01:34:21.075 --> 01:34:22.384
<i>Don't go away.</i>

01:34:29.151 --> 01:34:33.005
To win, first you have to know
whose side you're on.

01:34:39.594 --> 01:34:41.849
<i>In our line of work...</i>

01:34:41.929 --> 01:34:46.385
<i>...that's right up there with black holes
or "to be or not to be."</i>

01:34:48.603 --> 01:34:51.242
You fight the good fight, and then
one day you wake up and you realize...

01:34:51.322 --> 01:34:53.750
...that all you were
was Satan's little helper.

01:35:14.195 --> 01:35:15.851
<i>Ironic.</i>

01:35:15.931 --> 01:35:19.354
<i>The news will tell them
there will be no more secrets.</i>

01:35:20.734 --> 01:35:24.175
<i>But you and I, we both know that's not true.</i>

01:35:24.873 --> 01:35:28.351
<i>The world is run on secrets.</i>

01:35:34.716 --> 01:35:37.471
<i>Whoever has that list has power.</i>

01:35:37.551 --> 01:35:40.639
<i>And without it,
you're just another fucking target.</i>

01:35:47.762 --> 01:35:50.952
<i>So, what have I learned after all this time?</i>

01:35:51.032 --> 01:35:53.254
After all the sleepless nights...

01:35:53.934 --> 01:35:57.191
<i>...lying to friends, lovers, myself?</i>

01:35:57.271 --> 01:36:00.162
<i>Playing this crooked game
in this crooked town...</i>

01:36:00.242 --> 01:36:03.400
<i>...filled with backstabbers
and four-faced liars?</i>

01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:08.102
<i>I'll tell you what I've learned.
One thing and one thing only.</i>

01:36:08.182 --> 01:36:11.169
I fucking love Berlin!

01:36:36.511 --> 01:36:39.725
- You didn't have to kill her.
- You what...

01:36:39.805 --> 01:36:43.671
...you suddenly decided to develop
a conscience after all you've done?

01:36:44.551 --> 01:36:48.877
Have you noticed how everyone you
get close to ends up fucking dead?

01:36:48.957 --> 01:36:51.647
You gave Bremovych the details of the plan.

01:36:52.627 --> 01:36:55.318
You went to the KGB to take me out.

01:36:56.898 --> 01:36:59.673
You were too fucking scared
to do it yourself.

01:36:59.753 --> 01:37:02.357
Too smart, more like.

01:37:03.637 --> 01:37:07.255
If those KGB pricks had done their part,
I'd be on my way to a hand job...

01:37:07.335 --> 01:37:09.173
...with the queen by now.

01:37:10.077 --> 01:37:13.736
I've read that list, Lorraine.

01:37:16.717 --> 01:37:18.639
And you feature heavily.

01:37:18.719 --> 01:37:21.974
Turns out you've been a very naughty girl.

01:37:24.525 --> 01:37:27.047
Spyglass was a liability to us all.

01:37:27.127 --> 01:37:30.986
- I couldn't risk leaving him with you.
- Where's the list, David?

01:37:31.366 --> 01:37:33.330
I don't have it.

01:37:33.410 --> 01:37:36.654
It's en route to MI6, where it belongs.

01:37:52.086 --> 01:37:54.506
Are you going to lie till the very end?

01:38:00.861 --> 01:38:03.484
Truth and lies.

01:38:04.564 --> 01:38:08.656
- People like us don't know the difference.
- No, we know the difference, David.

01:38:09.236 --> 01:38:11.324
We choose to ignore it.

01:38:12.540 --> 01:38:15.028
Isn't that right, Comrade Satchel?

01:38:16.864 --> 01:38:19.219
So that's how you'll make it work.

01:38:19.299 --> 01:38:22.369
"It's a double pleasure
to deceive the deceiver."

01:38:22.449 --> 01:38:24.000
Well played.

01:38:41.036 --> 01:38:43.202
You killed David Percival?

01:38:45.907 --> 01:38:50.597
All the paperwork is in order for the bodies
of James Gascoigne and David Percival.

01:38:53.881 --> 01:38:57.972
You killed our head of station,
an officer of the Crown.

01:38:58.052 --> 01:39:00.742
You'd better have hard proof
and a damn good explanation.

01:39:00.822 --> 01:39:04.309
- Who are you to judge my actions?
- I'm your superior.

01:39:10.931 --> 01:39:13.018
My superior.

01:39:15.236 --> 01:39:17.592
This was never about stopping the war.

01:39:17.672 --> 01:39:19.928
It was about saving your ass.

01:39:20.808 --> 01:39:23.524
You couldn't bear the embarrassment...

01:39:23.604 --> 01:39:26.468
...of the sins that we committed
in the Cold War.

01:39:27.348 --> 01:39:30.171
And I was stupid enough
to give my life for it.

01:39:30.251 --> 01:39:33.440
Yes, well, that's your job, isn't it?

01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:35.539
I did my job.

01:39:38.710 --> 01:39:41.934
Despite your best efforts
and your incompetence...

01:39:43.564 --> 01:39:45.852
I succeeded where you failed.

01:39:47.534 --> 01:39:50.225
I uncovered your traitor, Satchel.

01:39:51.005 --> 01:39:53.493
Brought him the only justice he deserved.

01:39:57.162 --> 01:39:59.015
A bullet.

01:40:00.381 --> 01:40:04.205
Percival meeting with Bremovych
the day before Spyglass was killed.

01:40:05.585 --> 01:40:08.276
<i>Maybe we could make some sort of arrangement.</i>

01:40:08.356 --> 01:40:11.980
<i>You got to know that I'm the only man in
this town that can help you get that list.</i>

01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:14.916
<i>Very impressive. Dedication.</i>

01:40:14.996 --> 01:40:17.617
<i>Loyalty. They're rare things these days.</i>

01:40:17.697 --> 01:40:20.519
<i>"It's a double pleasure
to deceive the deceiver."</i>

01:40:25.993 --> 01:40:28.091
We have a deal?

01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:33.234
- What about the British?
- <i>Do you trust Gray?</i>

01:40:33.514 --> 01:40:35.569
- No.
- What about C?

01:40:35.649 --> 01:40:38.180
<i>C is an arrogant lapdog
who understands precisely...</i>

01:40:38.260 --> 01:40:40.665
...fuck-all beyond the edge of his desk.

01:40:44.259 --> 01:40:46.545
Percival was Satchel.

01:40:52.833 --> 01:40:54.720
Where's the list?

01:40:55.369 --> 01:40:57.552
Where's the list, Lorraine?

01:40:57.972 --> 01:40:59.792
I don't know.

01:41:03.495 --> 01:41:06.969
Bollocks. The prime minister is going
to have a difficult time with this.

01:41:12.086 --> 01:41:14.742
We're choosing to bury this one, Broughton.

01:41:14.822 --> 01:41:17.344
Your mission never took place.

01:41:17.424 --> 01:41:19.443
This conversation...

01:41:21.629 --> 01:41:23.482
...never happened.

01:41:26.066 --> 01:41:28.722
I'm putting you on leave,
effective immediately.

01:41:29.002 --> 01:41:32.457
We'll start the next decade well rested.

01:41:34.441 --> 01:41:35.660
C?

01:41:38.045 --> 01:41:39.864
What should I wear...

01:41:46.086 --> 01:41:47.973
...for my tea with the queen?

01:45:59.106 --> 01:46:02.727
Did you really think
I was going to give you that list?

01:46:03.843 --> 01:46:07.502
Before you die, I want you to get this
through your thick, primitive skull.

01:46:10.284 --> 01:46:12.537
I never worked for you.

01:46:12.736 --> 01:46:14.572
You worked for me.

01:46:21.696 --> 01:46:25.518
Every false intel I gave you,
a rip in the Iron Curtain.

01:46:28.235 --> 01:46:31.390
Every piece of intel you gave me,
a bullet in my fucking gun.

01:46:32.607 --> 01:46:34.750
I want my life back.

01:47:22.822 --> 01:47:24.641
Safe travels.

01:47:50.316 --> 01:47:54.241
<i>Estimated flight time to Langley,
11 hours and 37 minutes.</i>

01:47:54.321 --> 01:47:56.476
<i>Cleared for takeoff.</i>

01:47:56.556 --> 01:47:58.378
Let's go home.

01:47:58.758 --> 01:48:00.645
That sounds good.

01:48:02.012 --> 01:48:03.899
Let's go home.

01:48:10.705 --> 01:48:12.217
"Cocksucker"?

01:48:13.239 --> 01:48:14.825
Really?

01:48:17.477 --> 01:48:19.698
I'm glad it was convincing.
