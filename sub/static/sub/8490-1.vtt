Varanasi. Year 1327
(Bengali calendar)

05:34.960 --> 05:36.598
Have you seen the monkey?

05:36.880 --> 05:40.429
- A monkey got into the house?
- I mean your precious son

05:44.880 --> 05:47.758
I boiled milk for him,
but he vanished

05:49.360 --> 05:52.238
The boys in this neighbourhood...

05:57.280 --> 06:00.750
It's so crowded; how can I
keep an eye on him here?

06:02.200 --> 06:04.031
Isn't there a school nearby?

06:04.320 --> 06:06.436
If he went there,
I'd have a rest from worry

06:22.960 --> 06:24.598
You said it was for Khoka

06:24.880 --> 06:29.431
You'll have some, too, from now on.
It's in the kitchen

06:56.480 --> 07:00.234
- Won't you go to market?
- Of course. What should I get?

07:00.520 --> 07:01.839
I'll tell you, but...

07:02.120 --> 07:05.749
Thinking of money?
I don't have to pay in cash

07:06.120 --> 07:08.190
He'll give you credit?

07:08.560 --> 07:11.916
Do you think I supply all those
herbal medicines free?

07:12.280 --> 07:16.432
Then bring some mustard oil,
some kerosene and some spices

07:17.720 --> 07:23.078
See if you can get some mung dal...
mung or masoor, or whatever

07:23.360 --> 07:28.229
Apu's been asking for khichree since
he had some at the ghat the other day

07:32.360 --> 07:34.555
Can you get some paan masala?

07:34.880 --> 07:36.757
- What brand?
- I don't know

07:37.120 --> 07:39.236
The woman upstairs gave me some

07:40.560 --> 07:43.233
Find out the name
and I'll bring it tomorrow

07:50.280 --> 07:54.239
I met a sweet-seller I knew.
He says he has rheumatism

07:54.880 --> 08:00.989
I'm taking him some medicine. I could
ask him for some cream from Kashi

08:02.360 --> 08:04.237
Shall I ask him for some?

08:05.080 --> 08:06.957
Let the medicine work first

08:27.960 --> 08:31.236
Aren't you going to bathe
in the Ganga?

08:31.520 --> 08:33.828
If you don't, you won't get salvation

08:34.120 --> 08:37.429
They've just arrived.
Let them settle in first

08:37.720 --> 08:43.431
They will bathe, pay homage
to Vishwanathji-all in good time

08:51.680 --> 08:54.274

Water

09:42.200 --> 09:44.430
Apul Wait

09:51.480 --> 09:56.349
Aren't you hungry?
Have you eaten anything outside?

10:07.360 --> 10:09.430
And a pedha as well

10:14.120 --> 10:16.270
- Is Ray-mashai at home?
- No

10:17.960 --> 10:24.069
I've a calendar for him. I came home
too late to give it to him last night

10:25.960 --> 10:27.837
Shall I put it in his room?

10:32.760 --> 10:35.149
We bring one out every year

10:35.440 --> 10:38.193
You'll find all the important
holy days in it

10:38.480 --> 10:42.758
The holy festivals are marked in red,
so they're easy to see

10:50.960 --> 10:55.750
O Lord of the world, those who have
faith in you are the blessed ones

10:56.280 --> 11:01.434
Those who worship you are the holy
ones, those who praise you...

12:01.720 --> 12:06.589
Look! She weeps with her head
on Krishna's breast

12:06.880 --> 12:08.438
I'll tell my brother

12:09.720 --> 12:14.794
Then Jatila quietly takes her brother
Ayan to her hiding place and says:

12:16.120 --> 12:20.591
"Look at that.
See what your wife is up to

12:20.880 --> 12:25.237
"She weeps with her head
on Krishna's breast"

12:25.720 --> 12:29.838
You see what has happened
meanwhile?

12:30.120 --> 12:34.238
Krishna tells Radha: "Lay a flower
at my feet as an offering...

12:34.560 --> 12:37.791
"...and I'll take the form of the
goddess Kali, to please Ayan"

13:01.880 --> 13:03.598
Want to swing a club?

14:00.800 --> 14:06.511
Anything else?

14:42.360 --> 14:45.238
- What's the name of the man upstairs?
- Nanda-babu

14:45.560 --> 14:49.439
Tell him that mother has used all
the matches and father isn't home yet

14:49.720 --> 14:53.759
Ask him for just two matches

15:19.960 --> 15:24.192
I'll swing it, then

15:50.960 --> 15:52.632
Khoka, come in

15:53.000 --> 15:55.833
- What do you want?
- Matches

15:56.200 --> 15:59.431
- What will you do with matches?
- Mother wants them

16:06.960 --> 16:12.080
That's my medicine. I'm ill, you see.
Doctor says to take it every evening

16:13.560 --> 16:16.438
Only two matches, mother said

16:16.720 --> 16:20.429
Take the whole box,
I have more of them

16:23.200 --> 16:27.955
Tell your mother that Nanda-babu
says she need not return it

17:28.480 --> 17:30.596
You have a fine voice

17:38.600 --> 17:41.433
It seems you are a singer, too

17:42.360 --> 17:43.759
I used to be

17:45.920 --> 17:47.990
Do you live nearby?

17:48.560 --> 17:53.839
I wondered if I could have some tea.
It's chilly, my throat is sore

17:54.120 --> 17:58.830
See how I've brought tealeaves,
tied to the end of my wrapper

17:59.120 --> 18:02.999
Come along, I live quite near,
in Ganesh Mohalla

18:03.280 --> 18:08.434
You don't mind? My name is
Kalicharan Banerji, from Satkhire

18:16.080 --> 18:18.435
Lord knows whether it's all right

18:28.960 --> 18:33.158
- I want some, too
- Later. Give them this tea first

18:39.200 --> 18:42.749
Then come back and take the sweets

19:05.360 --> 19:07.237
Excellent tea

19:11.080 --> 19:14.436
Where is your son?
He is a good boy

19:20.560 --> 19:25.350
On Tuesday I'll take you to a feast
at the palace of Teota

19:25.640 --> 19:26.550
Will you come?

19:28.560 --> 19:33.429
Every year they have a feast
at the palace...

19:38.360 --> 19:41.079
Will you mind if I take your son?

19:46.920 --> 19:53.553
My friend, I have saved about 400
rupees, starving most of the time

19:54.040 --> 19:59.910
Another hundred or so and I can get
myself a bride from a decent family

20:03.520 --> 20:07.752
You can't be happy without a family
of your own, can you?

20:26.680 --> 20:30.753
- You wouldn't know of any girl...
- I'm afraid not

21:51.080 --> 21:57.553
The Pandeys have gone to the Ramlila
performance. Can't you take Apu, too?

22:00.800 --> 22:02.836
Would you take these?

22:27.800 --> 22:29.836
You're burning with fever

22:30.400 --> 22:36.430
I went to the market, then to
the sweet-seller, for the cream...

22:37.280 --> 22:40.829
...then to the ghat
for evening prayers

22:42.600 --> 22:46.070
Then as I was climbing the steps...

22:49.000 --> 22:51.639
Apu has gone out to buy fireworks

22:52.680 --> 22:54.636
Why do you need Apu?

22:55.400 --> 22:57.152
- Shouldn't we call a doctor?
- Don't bother

22:57.480 --> 23:00.631
I'm not going to listen to you

23:09.080 --> 23:14.279
In that tin box there are some
herbal medicines

23:14.560 --> 23:16.676
Give me a dose

23:18.320 --> 23:21.790
Mix well with juice of ginger
and honey

23:22.160 --> 23:28.395
Let me try it. If I'm not better
by tomorrow, then we'll see

23:30.000 --> 23:32.798
Sit with your father, he's ill

23:43.600 --> 23:46.831
Which fireworks did you buy?

23:52.240 --> 23:57.189
They're not as good as those
in Nishchindipur, are they?

23:59.800 --> 24:03.634
Were you watching the fireworks
from the terrace

24:07.160 --> 24:09.674
- Who is calling you?
- Shambhu

24:11.160 --> 24:13.674
He lives in Kukurgali,
he's not a Bengali

24:14.280 --> 24:18.159
Is he your friend? The one
who teaches you English?

24:18.320 --> 24:19.070
...and they send me an invitation

24:19.760 --> 24:23.639
What is "Apu bhalechheley"
in English?

24:30.400 --> 24:34.029
- Why not invite him in?
- He's going to set off fireworks now

24:35.160 --> 24:38.630
- You want to go with him?
- Yes

24:41.080 --> 24:42.638
Go, then

25:03.800 --> 25:07.031
- How are you feeling now?
- Much better

25:08.400 --> 25:14.032
You gave me such a fright.
You must have caught a chill

25:16.800 --> 25:19.519
Take things easy,
you're earning enough

25:26.080 --> 25:27.433
Sit for a while

25:27.720 --> 25:31.998
There's work to be done.
I have to make Apu's bed

25:32.280 --> 25:38.913
The sweet-seller told me about
a dwelling near the Man Mandir

25:39.240 --> 25:44.439
On the first floor, two rooms, facing
south. The rent is seven rupees

25:44.720 --> 25:48.315
There are markets and schools nearby.
Khoka won't have any problems

25:48.600 --> 25:51.114
We'll talk about it
when you're better

25:51.400 --> 25:55.279
- What is the boy doing?
- Can't you hear him?

26:37.440 --> 26:40.432
But for the monkeys,
Kashi would be a good place

26:41.880 --> 26:45.509
- Are you going out?
- Don't I have to go to the ghat?

26:45.800 --> 26:50.112
- Can't you stay, after such a fever?
- I'm all right, the medicine worked

26:51.240 --> 26:53.754
You'll climb all those steps...

28:25.640 --> 28:28.279
I didn't hear anything in the night,

28:28.560 --> 28:32.109
we came back late
from the performance

28:32.400 --> 28:38.077
My wife was going to the ghat
when she heard he had collapsed

28:38.360 --> 28:40.032
I hope he hasn't hurt himself

28:47.440 --> 28:50.671
For one thing, he has a chest cold

28:50.960 --> 28:56.671
The room is damp. Close the door
and windows, to keep the cold out

28:59.040 --> 29:02.112
Someone come with me,
I'll prescribe medicines

29:02.400 --> 29:04.118
I'll come with you myself

29:17.240 --> 29:22.109
If you need anything,
don't be shy to ask

31:26.040 --> 31:26.597
If you have mustard oil and camphor,
rub his back and chest with them

32:09.800 --> 32:11.870
Ganga...

32:27.000 --> 32:32.199
Go to the ghat, get a pot of water
and run back at once

32:52.680 --> 32:55.956
He'll be back at any moment

33:45.600 --> 33:47.477
Khoka is back

34:55.239 --> 34:57.629
Pay your respects
to your great-uncle

35:07.280 --> 35:10.670
- How old is he?
- He is ten now

35:11.760 --> 35:15.070
- When was he given the sacred thread?
- After coming to Kashi

35:17.320 --> 35:19.834
Will you come with me?

35:21.760 --> 35:26.959
I can't make up my mind.
I hadn't thought of leaving here

35:28.920 --> 35:31.798
I didn't know when you were coming

35:32.080 --> 35:37.029
I always come at this time. I did
not know you were so badly off

35:40.480 --> 35:42.675
- What are your employers like?
- Good people

35:43.080 --> 35:45.799
They'll be going to Dewanpur

35:49.760 --> 35:51.591
So I can't make up my mind

35:51.920 --> 35:56.630
Think it over. I am here for
a few more days

35:57.240 --> 36:03.952
If you stay at my house, it gets
lived in and you'll have no problems

35:57.880 --> 36:31.880
Get out at once!

36:31.880 --> 36:33.108
Bou-than, are you making paan?

37:28.760 --> 37:31.638
No, the one next to it

37:33.920 --> 37:36.798
There's a leather purse there

40:37.640 --> 40:43.078
You're coming with us, aren't you?
We're going to Dewanpur next month

40:43.960 --> 40:48.272
I told you that I would take you
if I liked your work

40:49.920 --> 40:52.798
I hope you'll agree.
Have you any relatives here?

40:53.640 --> 40:57.076
Nor where you come from?
So you might as well come with us

41:04.200 --> 41:09.797
Mokshada says you've lost
your appetite. Are you well?

43:52.400 --> 43:53.594
Go and open that drawer

44:39.640 --> 44:44.794
Tell them in the other house
that Thakur-mashai is back

45:08.640 --> 45:10.790
Mother! A train!

46:09.320 --> 46:12.392
I've brought firewood.
Have you enough food?

46:12.680 --> 46:14.557
Yes, enough until tomorrow

46:14.840 --> 46:19.595
I'll come back tomorrow. Whenever
you need anything, just tell me

46:19.920 --> 46:23.356
- You haven't told me your name
- Nirupama

46:43.480 --> 46:47.792
I'm here for another week or so;
will you be settled in by then?

46:52.320 --> 46:57.952
Apu, come with me tomorrow. You can
learn what you have to do as a priest

47:14.720 --> 47:18.793
Place the deity on the throne
and put some tulsi leaves on him

47:35.760 --> 47:37.591
No, wash them first

49:50.400 --> 49:52.470
What's the matter with you?

49:54.200 --> 50:00.275
You've been sulking since morning.
Are you ill? Are you feeling sad?

50:03.400 --> 50:07.279
Are you missing Kashi,
or Nishchindipur?

50:09.640 --> 50:12.279
Don't you like it here in Mansapota?

50:12.560 --> 50:14.949
Have they been rude to you?

50:15.680 --> 50:18.558
Have you been doing
your job properly?

50:20.720 --> 50:25.271
They are good people here. If we keep
them happy, our livelihood is secure

50:26.800 --> 50:31.078
Bear it for a few years. Then we may
be able to go back to Nishchindipur

50:34.800 --> 50:37.837
Mother, I want to go to school

50:38.120 --> 50:39.189
Which school?

50:39.480 --> 50:41.869
Nearby, in Arboal. It's a good school

50:42.160 --> 50:43.878
How do you know it's good?

50:44.160 --> 50:46.435
I've seen it

50:46.720 --> 50:49.837
- What about your work?
- That's mornings; school's afternoon

50:50.120 --> 50:55.069
Can you do both? Don't you need
money to go to school?

50:58.040 --> 51:01.589
Haven't you any money put away,
mother?

51:26.440 --> 51:29.273
Are the sweets
and everything else ready?

51:34.400 --> 51:36.595
Only half an hour left

52:13.720 --> 52:15.597
I'll attend to it, sir

53:43.120 --> 53:46.078
- What is the subject now?
- Bengali, sir

53:49.400 --> 53:54.269
The Foliage of Literature.
What does foliage mean?

53:59.400 --> 54:00.879
Foliage means...

54:06.080 --> 54:07.672
It means green leaves, sir

54:17.960 --> 54:19.439
The Land of Bengal

54:19.720 --> 54:25.033
Where is the greenest land of all?

54:25.320 --> 54:29.711
Where on tender grass
your feet must fall?

54:35.720 --> 54:39.599
It is our Bengal, our very own Bengal,
the greenest land of all

54:39.880 --> 54:42.394
Where do the thrush and robin sing?

54:54.160 --> 54:57.675
In our Bengal, our very own Bengal,
the greenest land of all

54:58.160 --> 55:03.029
In what land do they speak a tongue
that fills your soul with yearning?

55:03.320 --> 55:08.440
Where do you hear such clear tones
of a baul whose heart is singing?

55:15.600 --> 55:19.036
Where's the signature?
Why isn't it done?

55:27.280 --> 55:31.034
Come and sit down.
Is your mother well?

55:31.320 --> 55:33.231
The Inspector was very happy with you

55:33.560 --> 55:37.235
Not that I was any less happy

55:38.160 --> 55:43.757
I've kept an eye on your progress,
I've spoken to Abinash-babu about you

55:44.960 --> 55:47.269
He is above average

55:48.880 --> 55:52.031
We expect a great deal from you

55:52.560 --> 55:58.192
On our part, we shall provide you
with every facility

55:59.560 --> 56:06.033
But if you want to be a really good
student, work hard. Especially...

56:07.160 --> 56:10.436
...you'll have to improve
your English

56:11.880 --> 56:15.668
Do you like reading?
I don't mean textbooks

56:15.960 --> 56:21.034
Books about travel,
lives of great men...

56:21.520 --> 56:27.311
...books about science... if I give
you such books, will you read them?

56:29.360 --> 56:32.033
Of course he will read them

56:35.880 --> 56:38.155
I have many such books here

56:38.280 --> 56:38.837
Where do weaverbirds nest again,
where do swallows cry for rain?

56:39.320 --> 56:44.235
If you don't read such books,
you cannot broaden your mind

56:46.080 --> 56:49.550
We may live in a remote corner
of Bengal...

56:49.840 --> 56:54.516
...but that does not mean that
our outlook should be narrow

56:57.840 --> 57:02.038
This book is about the North Pole

57:02.360 --> 57:08.833
From this book anyone can learn about
the aurora borealis or the Eskimos

57:15.160 --> 57:16.832
You can learn about Africa

57:18.360 --> 57:22.319
This is the story of inventions

57:26.760 --> 57:29.274
Here are biographies of scientists:

57:47.000 --> 57:52.074
The sun, the earth and the moon.
The moon goes around the earth

57:52.360 --> 57:56.069
When the shadow falls here,
that's an eclipse

59:01.240 --> 59:02.514
Come in, Apurba

59:06.960 --> 59:10.111
You've come second in the district

59:17.600 --> 59:20.558
You'll study further, won't you?

59:20.840 --> 59:24.628
You can get
a scholarship of ten rupees

59:33.160 --> 59:35.151
You'll continue your studies?

59:35.520 --> 59:38.398
In Calcutta? Arts or sciences?

59:40.840 --> 59:43.877
Have you anywhere to stay there?
Any relatives?

59:46.640 --> 59:52.078
Anyway, that's not a problem.
Have you spoken to your mother?

59:52.440 --> 59:54.032
Not yet

59:54.360 --> 59:57.875
- Can you get her to agree?
- I will try

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:24.954
I came second in the district,
there's only one above me

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:32.672
I might even get a scholarship,
money for doing well in examinations

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:35.674
- How much?
- Ten rupees a month

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:41.230
But only if I continue my studies

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:46.994
Do you think
they'll give it just like that?

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:49.475
I must go and study in Calcutta

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:56.950
What is this, mother?

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:28.194
You're going?

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:29.595
Why not?

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:36.992
He gave me some addresses

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:39.077
Who's going to pay for it?

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:42.158
The college will be half free

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:45.079
I'll get ten rupees
a month, I'll find work

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:52.276
If you give up your job as a priest,
will they take care of us then?

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:54.994
So I must stick at being a priest?

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:59.068
Why not? You're a priest's son.
Do you want to be a governor?

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:03.154
Yes! Must everything be as you wish?

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:04.595
Everything!

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:25.677
There are snakes, mosquitoes
will bite you. Come back

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:29.957
All right, you can go to Calcutta,

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:34.513
but you must think things over first

01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:40.040
- Why hit me?
- I'm sorry. I'll show you something

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:02.034
Whose is that?

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:09.038
When I worked in Kashi,
do you know how much I saved?

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:17.195
Thirty-two rupees

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:20.757
I'll give you something from this,
enough to last out a month

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:33.674
The headmaster gave it to me.
It's a globe, it shows our earth

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:38.914
See, these are the countries,
and the blue is the sea

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:40.838
See where Calcutta is?

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:52.949
- It's seven-thirty
- Come and see where I've put things

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:57.993
There's your tumbler, your bowl,

01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:02.034
sweets in the bowl, some spices...

01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:06.633
Here's some ghee
I've made from cream

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:10.435
Your shirts and vests...

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:13.638
...and the dhobi is in the bedding

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:25.273
Five rupees from the purse
and twenty-five from me

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:50.631
The key, keep it safe

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:13.073
Come home
at the puja festival, if you can

01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:00.275
Have you ever tripped
and hurt yourself?

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:05.959
If not, you'll have
plenty of opportunities

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:12.357
This wonderful balm will come to
your aid like a benevolent friend

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:44.794
Akhil-babu?

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.151
- I have a letter
- What letter?

01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:09.997
From the headmaster of Arboal School

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:29.678
Paresh wrote to me about this

01:09:35.359 --> 01:09:38.078
You've come here to study?

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:42.558
Any money?

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:48.238
I have twenty-nine rupees and six
annas after paying the train fare

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.158
Can I get a room here?

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:59.510
I have only the one room,
but we'll manage with it

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:00.915
What rent?

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:04.869
Can you work in the printing shop?

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:10.270
At night, after classes?

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:17.997
Go upstairs and you'll find the room;
I'll be up in a moment

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:41.952
Dear mother, I have arrived safely.
Akhil-babu has arranged for my stay

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:47.951
I won't pay rent, I'll work
in the printing shop

01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:04.996
Couldn't you find a better place
to sleep than CCB's class?

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:07.957
Are you crying?

01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:14.359
Come on, we've two free periods
after this. Let's go for a walk

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:35.951
Apu, don't you wish to go abroad?

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:39.394
Find me a job on a ship

01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:44.953
I'm serious.
Let's go together, shall we?

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:50.992
No ambitions?

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:55.273
You'll stay like a frog in a well,
even if you get the chance?

01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:01.950
Mother will never let me go

01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:09.273
She didn't even want me to come here,
although it's only 3 hours by train

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:15.359
I have ambitions, or I'd have stayed
there. I even had a job there

01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:19.277
- What job?
- That of a priest

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:25.032
The family profession? You wear the
sacred thread? No Brahman's pigtail?

01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:33.796
We've missed two classes today

01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:47.314
We slipped up. We should have told
Pranab to answer for us at roll call

01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:51.512
No problem in PNG's class

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:35.954
Have you grown taller?

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:39.395
So you're thinner

01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:41.559
Did you get my letter?

01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:43.638
I'm not speaking to you

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:47.480
You said holidays were from the 7th.
What's the date today?

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:49.353
I had some work

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:52.672
Admit you didn't want
to come to your mother

01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:07.192
Apu, you'll catch cold

01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:26.879
- What do they give you to eat there?
- Everything

01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:33.955
Lentils, rice, fish, vegetables

01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:37.312
- Who does the cooking?
- There's a cook

01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:39.318
A good cook?

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:09.478
Stop reading

01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:19.312
Talk to me.
What have you seen in Calcutta?

01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:23.309
- Everything
- Tell me, then

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:28.674
Victoria Memorial,
Whiteway Laidlaw...

01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:34.313
...Hogg Market,
the zoo, Fort William...

01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:38.711
The temple at Kalighat?

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:44.950
Yes, I went there the other day.
And Keoratala...

01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:47.551
What's in Keoratala?

01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:11.478
When will you pass your examinations
and get a job? Can I stay with you?

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:18.679
Rubbish

01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:24.318
What if I'm seriously ill?
Such things happen

01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:29.311
Every evening
I feel feverish and dizzy

01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:32.636
I've no appetite at all

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:37.312
I've often thought of telling you,
but I haven't

01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:44.918
When you're able to earn money,
will you arrange treatment for me?

01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:18.597
Want paan?
Did you hear what Niru said?

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.877
You'll go, won't you?

01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:29.949
- Why not? She's asked you many times
- I've classes on Monday

01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:34.119
What does it matter
if you are two days late?

01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:40.115
You have so few holidays

01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:44.911
There are no holidays
until New Year

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:28.631
There's never time for packing in the
morning. I have to run for the train

01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:54.313
Sunrise is at quarter past six
tomorrow. Wake me in good time

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:15.479
I'm late

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.310
- Won't you check everything?
- There's no time

01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:42.916
I missed the train

01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:48.554
I'll go tomorrow

01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:52.759
Won't it upset your studies?

01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:06.679
- Would you like something to eat?
- Later, mother

01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:43.713
Dear Apu,
why don't you write regularly?

01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:47.838
I worry when I don't hear from you

01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:53.513
If you have a holiday during
the Ganesh puja, come home

01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:58.920
I haven't seen you for two months

01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:03.512
If you haven't enough money,
I'll send you some

01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:13.314
There are no Ganesh puja holiday
in my college, and I have exams soon

01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:18.839
If I don't stay in Calcutta,
my studies will suffer

01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:50.832
Every day I think of calling,
but I never manage it

01:31:56.640 --> 01:31:58.073
Heard from Apu?

01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:02.317
Is he well?

01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:09.159
Your son is a gem. You should get him
married, your worries would be over

01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:13.155
You're alone, and every day
I think of visiting you,

01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:15.715
but there's never time

01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:19.510
Yesterday, my son-in-law
arrived from Kalna

01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:25.512
They have a shop there.
He and his father look after it

01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:30.669
But what goings-on there are

01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:35.317
Three sons, and grandchildren, too

01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:39.030
The mother died, and the father
soon remarried

01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:12.755
Cremation ground

01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:16.674
What shall I do with so much?

01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:25.829
I can't stay now. I must go and
prepare medicine for Kumi's cough

01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:28.680
I'll come this evening, if I can

01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:33.957
Don't be cross, but we've written
to your great-uncle

01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:38.915
Why? He's an old man

01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:40.514
Have you written to Apu?

01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:48.196
Apu has a holiday
today and tomorrow

01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:52.030
Is he coming? Shall I write to him?

01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:59.393
If he comes, he must come
because he wants to

01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:08.395
His examinations are around the
corner. It's best if he stays there

01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:10.591
You mustn't write to him

01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:14.717
Promise me you won't

01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:25.710
I'll come again,
and so will the others

01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:31.791
- Shall I shut the door that's open?
- I'll do it later

01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:35.390
All right, I'll leave these
on the veranda

01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:58.798
I never expected to find you here

01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:02.353
Didn't you say you were leaving town
for two days?

01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:06.559
To your village... Mansapota?

01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:13.194
I can't study there, I fall asleep

01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:16.159
- Won't your mother be angry?
- No, I've fixed that

01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:22.951
I've sent her a money order,
from the bonus Akhil-babu gave me

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:28.038
Aren't you nervous?

01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:32.393
A little. I'm not quite ready
for the chemistry paper

01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:08.155
There's a letter for you

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:19.479
Is it from your mother?

01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:22.951
From Niri-di. Mother is ill

01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:25.197
Is it serious?

01:41:56.800 --> 01:42:01.749
Don't cry, Apu.
Parents don't stay with you forever

01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:09.597
It's what had to happen

01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:16.715
Now you'd better perform
the shraddha and then stay here

01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:22.554
You'll earn enough as a priest

01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:58.197
Where are you off to?

01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:08.590
- Why Calcutta?
- For my examinations

01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:12.951
And your mother's shraddha?

01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:15.800
I'll take care of that in Calcutta,
at Kalighat

01:43:16.305 --> 01:43:22.555
