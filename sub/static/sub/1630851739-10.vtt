00:21.000 --> 00:25.041
-Encore.
-Encore.

00:25.125 --> 00:28.166
-Encore.
-Encore.

00:28.250 --> 00:30.750
-Do you know what the encore song is?
-Encore.

00:30.833 --> 00:31.750
-What is it?
-Encore.

00:31.833 --> 00:33.583
-Encore.
-Encore.

00:33.666 --> 00:35.250
-You'll see.
-Encore.

00:35.333 --> 00:37.625
-Encore.
-Encore.

00:42.166 --> 00:43.416
Thank you.

00:43.500 --> 00:45.750
I'm so happy that you're here.

00:45.833 --> 00:49.375
It's a mini-concert
for the fans and the VIPs.

00:49.458 --> 00:50.791
Coming up.

00:50.875 --> 00:52.791
This is really the last song.

00:52.875 --> 00:55.458
When I was growing up,

00:55.541 --> 00:57.583
this song got me through a lot.

00:57.666 --> 01:00.666
When I'm sad and frustrated,

01:00.750 --> 01:03.041
I will sing this song.

01:03.125 --> 01:04.666
It keeps me company.

01:04.750 --> 01:06.875
Through this song,

01:06.958 --> 01:08.666
I hope I can make you feel it too.

01:08.750 --> 01:11.250
I'll always keep you company. Thank you.

02:04.666 --> 02:07.416
I wish, one day,
A-Lin can sing one of my songs too.

02:09.291 --> 02:10.916
Then I'll write the lyrics for you.

02:33.416 --> 02:35.208
<i>I thought for every sad love song,</i>

02:35.291 --> 02:37.166
<i>the stories behind them</i>

02:37.250 --> 02:40.333
<i>are the saddest thing in the world.</i>

02:43.833 --> 02:45.291
<i>I found out later that</i>

02:46.916 --> 02:48.875
<i>when the story is forgotten</i>

02:49.583 --> 02:52.041
<i>and the love song is left alone,</i>

02:53.708 --> 02:56.875
<i>that's sadder than sad.</i>

03:04.666 --> 03:09.708
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SHORE

03:11.666 --> 03:14.791
<i>Have a good trip.
Remember to bring souvenirs back.</i>

03:14.875 --> 03:15.750
<i>Okay.</i>

03:29.083 --> 03:31.083
It's done.

03:37.666 --> 03:39.750
Hey, you put it on wrongly.

03:39.833 --> 03:42.208
Who cares? It doesn't matter.

03:42.291 --> 03:43.583
It's so pretty.

03:43.666 --> 03:45.000
It's very good.

03:55.291 --> 03:56.458
Kai-kai.

04:13.833 --> 04:15.583
Does it hurt?

04:23.666 --> 04:25.291
I'm sorry.

04:32.125 --> 04:35.041
I'm sorry.

04:38.375 --> 04:39.958
How have you been?

04:44.708 --> 04:45.708
Good.

05:00.416 --> 05:01.875
As long as you're doing well,

05:05.125 --> 05:06.958
nothing else matters.

05:13.375 --> 05:14.458
Look at you.

05:36.666 --> 05:38.125
-Mom.
-Yes?

05:40.500 --> 05:42.291
How did you know I was here?

05:46.166 --> 05:47.875
I heard it from Dr. Chen.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.708
<i>Ma'am, I'm sorry.</i>

05:52.000 --> 05:54.083
That was for Chang Che-kai.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.583
Please go see him.

06:05.666 --> 06:06.750
Really?

06:16.125 --> 06:18.416
Chang Che-kai,
I'm checking your blood pressure.

06:26.416 --> 06:28.458
The patient in room 911 is gone.

06:29.416 --> 06:31.250
He was still there this afternoon.

06:33.416 --> 06:34.375
Okay.

06:35.333 --> 06:36.291
Okay.

06:38.458 --> 06:39.541
All right, I understand.

07:07.458 --> 07:10.166
<i>You look especially happy today.</i>

08:29.791 --> 08:32.458
You look better this way.

08:32.541 --> 08:34.041
-Why are you laughing?
-Why are you laughing?

08:52.208 --> 08:53.416
An Yi-chi.

09:03.041 --> 09:04.208
Po-han.

09:13.708 --> 09:14.916
Why are you here?

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
My assistant was gone when I woke up.

09:18.083 --> 09:19.958
She's not replying to my texts.

09:20.041 --> 09:21.333
What am I supposed to do?

09:22.708 --> 09:24.208
I quit my job.

09:24.291 --> 09:25.666
Did I approve that?

09:33.166 --> 09:34.416
Are you avoiding me?

09:47.125 --> 09:48.958
I'm happy to see you.

09:52.208 --> 09:53.375
Really.

09:58.083 --> 10:00.125
But I don't deserve to be happy.

10:01.666 --> 10:03.625
Ke-le's gone now.

10:03.708 --> 10:05.041
I don't deserve to be happy.

10:05.625 --> 10:06.958
I can't be happy.

10:13.166 --> 10:16.416
Po-han, I really miss Ke-le.

10:16.500 --> 10:17.541
What should I do?

10:19.500 --> 10:22.416
-I know.
-I miss Ke-le so much.

10:25.500 --> 10:26.666
Idiot.

10:26.750 --> 10:28.583
Of course you can miss him.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.375
Nobody said you can't.

10:35.500 --> 10:36.958
When I was unconscious,

10:38.041 --> 10:39.250
I saw Ke-le.

10:42.958 --> 10:45.000
He asked me to take good care of you.

10:45.083 --> 10:47.416
Don't make me break my promise.

10:52.958 --> 10:54.125
He's fine.

10:55.583 --> 10:57.541
No school, no homework.

10:58.166 --> 11:00.541
He can play video games and draw all day.

11:01.125 --> 11:02.583
It's awesome.

11:05.666 --> 11:07.250
That really sounds like him.

11:11.125 --> 11:12.583
So don't worry too much.

11:13.250 --> 11:14.666
It's just that he can't see us,

11:15.291 --> 11:16.708
and we can't see him either.

11:17.791 --> 11:19.750
We live in different worlds.

11:21.833 --> 11:23.750
But if we think about him every day,

11:24.916 --> 11:26.375
he won't be lonely.

11:27.208 --> 11:28.375
Okay?

11:35.041 --> 11:36.916
Then don't you ever disappear on me again.

11:57.750 --> 11:59.208
You're awake.

11:59.291 --> 12:00.916
Do you feel better?

12:02.083 --> 12:04.375
Let's go to the hospital later, okay?

12:06.541 --> 12:08.500
How did you find me?

12:08.583 --> 12:11.500
Come on. I'm Cream.

12:12.250 --> 12:13.916
I'll always find you.

12:20.458 --> 12:21.750
I'm warning you.

12:21.833 --> 12:24.000
You can't eat instant noodles,

12:24.666 --> 12:26.041
you can't have ice cream,

12:27.500 --> 12:29.708
and you can't run far away again.

12:31.458 --> 12:33.166
You promised me.

12:34.166 --> 12:37.125
We still have so many birthdays to go.

12:38.416 --> 12:40.541
We'll stay together until we're very old.

12:40.625 --> 12:41.833
Won't we?

12:53.625 --> 12:54.666
Don't be afraid.

12:56.375 --> 12:57.625
I'll keep you company.

13:23.083 --> 13:24.083
K.

13:25.583 --> 13:27.666
Why did you come to the beach?

13:32.750 --> 13:34.208
The sound of waves

13:34.791 --> 13:36.416
gives me inspiration for my song.

13:40.583 --> 13:42.458
Are you working on a new song?

13:42.541 --> 13:43.583
Yes.

13:45.541 --> 13:46.625
Do you remember

13:46.708 --> 13:48.791
when we went to A-Lin's concert together?

13:49.833 --> 13:51.250
I'll never forget it.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.083
Didn't I tell you

13:57.500 --> 13:59.166
that I want her to sing my song?

14:00.791 --> 14:02.375
How is your writing going?

14:05.083 --> 14:06.625
I wrote a little.

14:08.625 --> 14:10.458
Once you finish it,

14:10.958 --> 14:14.833
I'll write the greatest,
most incredible lyrics for you.

14:14.916 --> 14:16.375
When A-Lin wins an award,

14:16.458 --> 14:17.916
everyone will know

14:18.000 --> 14:21.041
that K and Cream are the best duo.

14:38.875 --> 14:40.833
Does Yu-hsien know that you're here?

14:43.083 --> 14:44.000
Don't worry.

14:45.083 --> 14:46.125
He's fine.

14:46.833 --> 14:48.708
He knows you're the only family I have.

14:50.125 --> 14:51.833
I have to take care of my family.

14:55.291 --> 14:56.416
Thank you.

15:00.416 --> 15:02.291
Idiot. What are you thanking me for?

15:19.708 --> 15:22.166
<i>After hearing the story of K and Cream,</i>

15:24.083 --> 15:25.541
I started to believe

15:26.791 --> 15:29.291
that there's a song so powerful

15:29.916 --> 15:32.041
and a relationship so deep,

15:33.166 --> 15:35.958
that you can feel happiness

15:36.041 --> 15:37.958
and sadness at the same time.

15:43.750 --> 15:44.791
Po-han.

15:46.666 --> 15:48.541
Why did you want to become a musician?

15:53.416 --> 15:55.041
Because one day, I hope

15:57.166 --> 15:58.583
I can make a song

15:59.416 --> 16:01.125
and play it to the person I like.

16:05.916 --> 16:06.750
I see.

16:10.791 --> 16:12.708
I wrote a new song.

16:13.291 --> 16:14.208
Do you want to hear it?

16:23.833 --> 16:24.875
Yes.

16:53.958 --> 16:55.125
Delicious, right?

20:22.958 --> 20:28.666
G KEY "THE SADDEST THING"

20:28.750 --> 20:32.291
G KEY "THE SADDEST THING"

21:10.708 --> 21:12.250
It's really good.

21:19.291 --> 21:20.291
Cream.

21:22.833 --> 21:25.666
Can we go home?

21:27.375 --> 21:29.583
It's going to be your birthday soon.

21:30.416 --> 21:32.208
Let's celebrate it.

21:43.333 --> 21:44.333
Okay.

21:44.416 --> 21:45.666
Let's go home.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.000
Don't clean up for me. I'll do it myself.

22:16.083 --> 22:17.583
It's okay. I'll do it.

22:20.958 --> 22:22.208
Hello, your delivery.

22:22.291 --> 22:24.541
-We didn’t--
-An Yi-chi?

22:25.125 --> 22:26.125
Do you live here?

22:26.208 --> 22:28.041
Why did you quit all of a sudden?

22:28.125 --> 22:30.083
I couldn't find you.
I've been calling you.

22:30.166 --> 22:32.750
I wanted to have coffee with you,
but you didn't pick up.

22:32.833 --> 22:33.958
When are you free?

22:34.666 --> 22:35.500
She's not available.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
Thank you.

22:38.083 --> 22:39.791
-I'm sorry.
-Call me back.

22:40.333 --> 22:42.625
We didn't order this.

22:42.708 --> 22:43.833
I did.

22:43.916 --> 22:45.041
I see.

22:51.416 --> 22:54.250
This is too much.
How can we finish all this?

22:54.333 --> 22:55.791
Do you think I'm a pig?

22:57.291 --> 22:59.166
I want to try all of them.

22:59.250 --> 23:00.416
That's why I ordered so much.

23:00.500 --> 23:01.625
What if it goes to waste?

23:03.375 --> 23:05.750
That's why we have to finish everything.

23:33.916 --> 23:35.125
-Is it good?
-Yes.

23:35.208 --> 23:36.583
Then have some more.

23:40.250 --> 23:41.666
Did everyone quit?

23:42.541 --> 23:44.208
Why are you always the one
coming to see me?

23:45.875 --> 23:47.541
If it wasn't me,

23:47.625 --> 23:50.166
the kids from my company
would've already been kicked out by you.

23:55.041 --> 23:57.916
I think you should have this back.

24:00.208 --> 24:01.375
Have you finished it?

24:02.958 --> 24:04.583
Is it good?

24:05.958 --> 24:07.333
I'm really sorry.

24:07.416 --> 24:08.916
If you want,

24:09.000 --> 24:10.375
I'll take full responsibility.

24:13.958 --> 24:16.000
I can accept this case

24:16.083 --> 24:17.291
but on one condition.

24:20.333 --> 24:21.666
I'll do the album cover.

24:21.750 --> 24:23.875
But I'd like to recommend
my assistant for the rest.

24:24.541 --> 24:25.833
She'll take the photos.

24:27.666 --> 24:29.916
Then we can still contract each other…

24:35.291 --> 24:37.125
-A-Lin.
-Hi.

24:38.500 --> 24:40.791
This is my student, Chen Hsien-an.

24:40.875 --> 24:42.708
Hello, A-Lin. Just call me Hsiao-kuai.

24:42.791 --> 24:43.875
Hi, Hsiao-kuai.

24:43.958 --> 24:45.458
Make me look pretty later.

24:45.541 --> 24:46.708
-No problem.
-Thank you.

24:58.416 --> 24:59.708
Very nice. Very beautiful.

25:00.458 --> 25:02.000
Good. Nice.

25:33.666 --> 25:37.000
LUZHOU ELECTRIC DRILL MURDERER
SCRIPTWRITER: HUANG SHU-HUI

25:38.083 --> 25:39.125
Okay.

25:41.125 --> 25:43.625
CHIN MEI DENTAL CLINIC

25:43.708 --> 25:44.958
Mr. Yang.

25:46.750 --> 25:47.916
What are you doing here?

25:48.000 --> 25:49.833
Didn't I tell you I'd find you?

25:49.916 --> 25:51.625
I wanted to show you this
as soon as I got it.

25:54.375 --> 25:55.375
Dad.

25:55.875 --> 25:56.708
Look.

25:57.458 --> 25:58.791
Cindy took this photo.

26:01.083 --> 26:02.083
Good.

26:02.166 --> 26:03.041
THE SADDEST THING

26:03.125 --> 26:04.083
Mr. Yang.

26:04.166 --> 26:07.291
Yu-hsien and I are going out to eat later.

26:09.041 --> 26:10.750
Would you like to join us?

26:33.916 --> 26:36.000
Hey, it's my birthday.

26:36.083 --> 26:37.541
Can you at least look happier?

26:39.291 --> 26:41.791
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

26:41.875 --> 26:44.250
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

26:44.333 --> 26:46.416
<i>-Happy birthday to--</i>
-Okay, that's enough.

26:46.500 --> 26:47.625
I'm making my wishes.

27:01.208 --> 27:02.416
Okay?

27:06.500 --> 27:07.750
One,

27:07.833 --> 27:09.583
two, three.

27:18.666 --> 27:19.708
Happy birthday.

27:21.708 --> 27:23.500
What did you wish for?

27:24.875 --> 27:25.875
It's a secret.

27:27.375 --> 27:29.333
You can't even tell me?

27:29.416 --> 27:31.125
You got your wish from me.

27:32.250 --> 27:33.833
If I tell you, it won't come true.

27:34.916 --> 27:36.416
I don't believe that.

27:37.875 --> 27:39.500
What did you wish for then?

27:46.208 --> 27:47.500
I hope

27:50.916 --> 27:53.416
I can meet you sooner in the next life.

27:58.625 --> 27:59.708
Idiot.

28:03.125 --> 28:04.625
We'll definitely meet each other.

28:07.583 --> 28:08.791
Promise me.

28:10.708 --> 28:12.291
You have to…

28:12.375 --> 28:14.666
You have to find me as soon as possible.

28:16.375 --> 28:18.375
I have a poor sense of direction.

28:19.416 --> 28:21.291
I might get lost.

28:35.750 --> 28:37.000
Don't be scared.

28:40.416 --> 28:41.708
I will find you no matter what.

28:51.625 --> 28:53.000
Do you remember this?

28:59.333 --> 29:01.041
We look like a family.

29:01.625 --> 29:03.291
It's because we are a family.

29:09.750 --> 29:10.708
Cream.

29:12.041 --> 29:13.750
Can we take another one?

29:26.750 --> 29:28.083
Are you ready?

29:52.041 --> 29:53.833
<i>From now on,</i>

29:54.708 --> 29:56.041
<i>your name will be K.</i>

29:56.833 --> 29:57.708
<i>Why?</i>

29:58.291 --> 30:01.458
K and Cream have the same phonetic "k."

30:03.041 --> 30:05.291
Don't you think that sounds like a family?

30:08.916 --> 30:09.916
Family?

30:11.333 --> 30:12.375
Yes.

30:12.458 --> 30:13.500
Family.

30:14.041 --> 30:15.666
From now on,

30:15.750 --> 30:17.375
we're family.

31:09.416 --> 31:12.541
COMPOSER: K, LYRICIST: CREAM

31:12.625 --> 31:16.208
<i>Regrets are never far</i>

31:16.291 --> 31:20.041
<i>But happiness</i>

31:21.166 --> 31:23.958
<i>Is already gone</i>

31:24.041 --> 31:25.583
THE SADDEST THING

31:25.666 --> 31:28.375
<i>A-Lin's new title track,
"The Saddest Thing,"</i>

31:28.458 --> 31:30.083
<i>-has been number one for three weeks</i>
-Okay.

31:30.166 --> 31:31.583
<i>-in a row on the chart.</i>
-Stop crying.

31:31.666 --> 31:33.625
<i>-I believe the story behind this song</i>
-It's okay.

31:33.708 --> 31:35.541
-It's okay.
<i>-has already touched a lot of fans.</i>

31:35.625 --> 31:37.291
<i>According to the producer,</i>

31:37.375 --> 31:40.666
<i>this song was a promise made
between the composer, K,</i>

31:40.750 --> 31:43.875
<i>at the final moment of his life,
and the lyricist, Cream.</i>

31:48.666 --> 31:51.166
THE SADDEST THING

32:04.583 --> 32:05.791
<i>For three years,</i>

32:07.083 --> 32:08.958
<i>I was all alone.</i>

32:11.791 --> 32:13.375
<i>But in my world,</i>

32:13.916 --> 32:15.708
<i>there are always two people,</i>

32:18.666 --> 32:21.333
<i>K and Cream.</i>

32:32.458 --> 32:34.583
Why did you write such a difficult song?

32:39.791 --> 32:40.916
<i>I thought</i>

32:41.791 --> 32:44.625
<i>if I remember my every moment with K,</i>

32:47.166 --> 32:48.916
<i>that means he never went away.</i>

32:50.958 --> 32:52.916
<i>And all the sad moments</i>

32:53.791 --> 32:55.250
<i>have never existed.</i>

33:01.291 --> 33:02.958
I missed you.

33:05.958 --> 33:06.875
<i>So…</i>

33:06.958 --> 33:08.166
<i>If you ask me</i>

33:09.791 --> 33:12.041
<i>how to stop missing someone,</i>

33:13.541 --> 33:15.208
<i>I don't have an answer.</i>

33:16.583 --> 33:19.208
<i>Because I've been in love with K
for 11 years.</i>

33:20.500 --> 33:22.875
<i>I can't imagine myself not loving him.</i>

33:25.916 --> 33:28.500
<i>Thank you, Bonnie.</i>

33:28.583 --> 33:29.625
Okay.

33:29.708 --> 33:32.500
<i>I wouldn't have finished the song
without your encouragement.</i>

33:35.250 --> 33:37.208
<i>Now that the song is finally done,</i>

33:38.083 --> 33:39.666
<i>I've fulfilled my promise with K.</i>

33:42.166 --> 33:43.208
<i>I have no regrets.</i>

33:48.750 --> 33:49.708
<i>K.</i>

33:50.500 --> 33:52.541
<i>I'm grateful to have met you in this life.</i>

33:55.708 --> 33:57.708
<i>Thank you for being my family.</i>

34:14.041 --> 34:15.333
<i>I'll find you</i>

34:16.625 --> 34:18.250
<i>in my next life.</i>

34:29.250 --> 34:30.208
Cream.

34:52.208 --> 34:54.500
<i>After "The Saddest Thing" was released,</i>

34:54.583 --> 34:57.250
<i>Cream disappeared again.</i>

34:58.750 --> 35:00.458
<i>No one knows where she went.</i>

35:01.375 --> 35:05.375
TOMB OF SUNG YUAN-YUAN
AND CHANG CHE-KAI

35:14.708 --> 35:15.791
What is this?

35:18.166 --> 35:19.666
This belonged to Yuan-yuan.

35:22.708 --> 35:25.250
I want to put her things with Che-kai's.

35:26.875 --> 35:27.916
All right.

35:37.708 --> 35:40.708
When you and I finished crying,
let's stop it.

35:41.708 --> 35:42.833
K and Cream,

35:43.416 --> 35:45.666
they're together happily.

35:47.166 --> 35:48.000
That's right.

35:48.083 --> 35:51.375
The two of them must be so happy now.

35:52.333 --> 35:53.708
Mr. Chi.

35:53.791 --> 35:55.166
You have to promise me.

35:55.250 --> 35:57.208
Don't die before me.

35:57.291 --> 35:59.208
Okay. I promise.

35:59.291 --> 36:00.625
We'll live a long life.

36:00.708 --> 36:03.583
Our story will be happier than happy.

36:03.666 --> 36:04.833
Yes.

36:11.791 --> 36:14.333
<i>Although K and Cream have gone,</i>

36:15.166 --> 36:18.833
<i>their story has turned into a melody,</i>

36:18.916 --> 36:20.833
<i>staying here in their place.</i>

36:21.625 --> 36:23.750
<i>And it made me realize</i>

36:23.833 --> 36:26.416
<i>that things still exist
even if they disappeared.</i>

36:28.166 --> 36:31.416
<i>I believe K and Cream hoped</i>

36:31.500 --> 36:33.416
<i>that everyone who hears this song</i>

36:33.500 --> 36:35.000
<i>and this story,</i>

36:35.666 --> 36:38.333
<i>even in sadness,</i>

36:38.416 --> 36:40.208
<i>can still be brave</i>

36:40.958 --> 36:43.125
<i>to embrace all the happiness and sadness</i>

36:43.208 --> 36:45.041
<i>that life brings.</i>

36:45.708 --> 36:47.583
I'm sure they're very happy now.

36:49.916 --> 36:51.958
Who said that the saddest story

36:52.625 --> 36:54.333
can't have a happy ending?

37:05.166 --> 37:06.166
What's wrong?

37:07.541 --> 37:08.666
Nothing.

37:08.750 --> 37:09.916
-Let's go.
-Okay.

37:13.833 --> 37:14.875
Do you want to go to the beach?

37:15.375 --> 37:16.208
Sure.

37:22.958 --> 37:24.958
<i>I read this article before.</i>

37:25.041 --> 37:26.041
<i>It says</i>

37:26.125 --> 37:28.833
<i>the ocean separates us from the afterlife.</i>

37:29.791 --> 37:31.041
So if one day,

37:31.125 --> 37:32.916
when we're gone,

37:33.000 --> 37:35.708
a ferryman would carry us
to the end of the sea.

37:36.333 --> 37:37.541
That's the other side.

37:40.625 --> 37:44.166
After reading it,
I really wanted to go to the beach.

37:44.250 --> 37:46.375
I feel like when I get there,

37:48.125 --> 37:49.916
I'll find them.

37:51.125 --> 37:53.500
If you want to go, we'll go.
