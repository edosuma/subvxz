00:20.540 --> 00:22.290
There were rumors
the Empire was working

00:22.290 --> 00:25.290
on a weapon
to neutralize
Mandalorian armor,

00:25.290 --> 00:27.750
that it had even
been tested
on our people.

00:27.750 --> 00:29.330
I... I didn't
believe it.

00:29.920 --> 00:31.670
Not the Empire.

00:31.670 --> 00:34.960
Me. This is all my fault.

00:34.960 --> 00:36.880
Sabine, you can't blame
yourself for this.

00:36.880 --> 00:38.040
You tried...

00:38.040 --> 00:40.670
Everything my father
said was true, Ezra!

00:40.670 --> 00:42.250
This is my work!

00:42.250 --> 00:44.120
I created
the weapon
that did this,

00:44.120 --> 00:47.080
and because of me,
the Empire is going
to turn my world

00:47.080 --> 00:48.960
into a graveyard!

00:48.960 --> 00:52.540
Because of me,
Mandalorians are
going to die!

01:12.330 --> 01:16.000
Mother, Tristan,
I... I thought I lost you.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.790
We were caught
at the edge
of the weapon's range.

01:18.790 --> 01:21.620
Thanks to your warning,
we made it out.

weren't so lucky.

02:28.960 --> 02:31.290

to leave now!

02:31.920 --> 02:34.540
All right. Let's go.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.380
I can keep us
in the air,

03:14.380 --> 03:16.000
but we can't take
another hit like that.

03:18.120 --> 03:19.080
Where are you going?

...Mandalorian?

Hey!

Huh?

Whoa! Whoa!

04:27.790 --> 04:28.960
In this recording,
you will see

04:28.960 --> 04:30.460
the first test trial

04:30.460 --> 04:32.580
of the weapon
used against Clan Wren.

04:43.540 --> 04:45.120
(SIZZLING)

04:48.540 --> 04:51.330
As you see,
the Arc Generator's
energy pulse

04:51.330 --> 04:55.620
is drawn to
the beskar alloy
in the Mandalorians' armor,

04:55.620 --> 04:57.000
superheating it

04:57.000 --> 05:00.080
and instantly
vaporizing the target,

05:00.750 --> 05:02.000
and all the while,

05:02.000 --> 05:06.580
doing no harm
to our Imperial
stormtroopers.

05:06.580 --> 05:09.500
The weapon is fully
operational, as promised,

05:09.500 --> 05:11.170
Grand Admiral.

05:11.170 --> 05:14.960
Effective, yes,
but you miss
the true artistry

05:14.960 --> 05:16.790
of this weapon,
Governor Saxon.

05:16.790 --> 05:19.460
It turns an armor
legendary for its strength

05:19.460 --> 05:21.120
into a crippling weakness,

05:21.120 --> 05:24.710
and it strikes at
the very heart
of your people's tradition.

05:24.710 --> 05:26.170
You said
the Emperor wanted

05:26.170 --> 05:28.210
this uprising
dealt with quickly.

05:28.210 --> 05:29.540
This will end it.

05:29.540 --> 05:32.290
You're different
than your brother.

05:32.290 --> 05:35.960
How would Gar Saxon
feel about you
betraying your heritage?

05:35.960 --> 05:37.960
He no longer feels
anything.

05:37.960 --> 05:39.170
I have evolved.

05:39.170 --> 05:42.000
Mandalore must
evolve with me.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.290
Once your people see

05:43.290 --> 05:45.710
their sense of security
turned against them,

05:45.710 --> 05:49.250
do you believe
they'll swear loyalty
to the Empire?

05:49.250 --> 05:50.880
A Mandalorian
without armor

05:50.880 --> 05:53.170
is no more than
a common soldier.

05:53.170 --> 05:56.250
Fear will compel them
to join the Empire.

05:57.210 --> 05:58.540
We shall see.

05:58.540 --> 06:01.540
Of course,
the weapon's range
is far more limited

06:01.540 --> 06:03.290
than you promised.

06:03.290 --> 06:06.210
Or perhaps you thought
I wouldn't notice?

06:06.210 --> 06:08.170
I only had pieces
of the prototype.

06:08.170 --> 06:09.790
I've done
everything I could.

06:09.790 --> 06:11.380
You cannot make it
work properly

06:11.380 --> 06:14.000
because you do not
truly understand it.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.460
You need
the weapon's creator.

06:16.460 --> 06:18.080
You need Sabine Wren.

06:21.960 --> 06:24.580
Governor, I mean
no disrespect,

06:24.580 --> 06:26.120
but what will
stop the Empire

06:26.120 --> 06:28.210
from using the weapon
on us as well?

06:28.210 --> 06:31.290
Unquestioning loyalty,
Captain.

06:31.290 --> 06:33.670
Now, find Sabine Wren.

06:46.580 --> 06:48.380
You told us
you destroyed it.

06:48.380 --> 06:51.330
I did. The Empire
must have rebuilt it. They...

06:51.330 --> 06:53.000
(YELLS)

06:53.000 --> 06:54.380
You're a Mandalorian!

06:54.380 --> 06:57.080
Why would you create
such an abomination?

06:57.080 --> 06:59.330
This is the weapon
of a coward.

07:01.620 --> 07:03.210
I was young.

07:03.210 --> 07:05.920
It was a challenge,
and I was arrogant.

07:05.920 --> 07:08.290
But when I realized
the Empire tested it

07:08.290 --> 07:10.330
and actually
planned to use it,

07:10.330 --> 07:13.960
I sabotaged the prototype
and destroyed the plans.

07:13.960 --> 07:15.290
I thought
that was the end of it,

07:15.290 --> 07:17.000
I swear to you!

07:23.580 --> 07:25.580
Okay, so this weapon
only targets

07:25.580 --> 07:27.290
Mandalorian armor, right?

07:27.290 --> 07:29.540
So why not make your armor
out of something different?

07:32.920 --> 07:36.170
Ezra, the armor I wear
is 500 years old.

07:36.170 --> 07:38.250
I reforged it
to my liking,

07:38.250 --> 07:40.790
but the battles,
the history, the blood,

07:40.790 --> 07:42.420
all lives within it,

07:42.420 --> 07:45.080
and the same goes
for every Mandalorian.

07:45.080 --> 07:47.750
This armor is part
of our identity.

07:47.750 --> 07:51.210
It makes us Mandalorians
who we are.

07:51.210 --> 07:53.330
And now it's going
to make us dead.

08:19.670 --> 08:21.250
Sabine Wren!

08:21.250 --> 08:22.830
We know you built
that weapon.

08:22.830 --> 08:24.170
You betrayed us all!

08:24.170 --> 08:25.290
You're a traitor
to Mandalore!

08:27.500 --> 08:29.380
Lower your weapons!

08:29.380 --> 08:32.000
Sabine did everything
she could to stop
this from happening.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.500
You must believe us.

08:33.500 --> 08:39.290
Any attack on my daughter
is an attack on Clan Wren.

08:40.830 --> 08:42.080
No.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.420
Sabine!
What are you doing?

08:45.420 --> 08:48.670
I'm prepared
to take responsibility
for my actions.

08:48.670 --> 08:50.250
It's true.

08:50.250 --> 08:53.460
I designed the weapon
as a loyal student
at the Imperial Academy.

08:53.460 --> 08:56.250
The Empire
is using my prototype,

08:56.250 --> 08:59.580
but it's only functioning
at a fraction
of its capacity.

08:59.580 --> 09:03.250
At full power,
it will destroy armies.

09:03.250 --> 09:05.540
So you've got
a choice to make.

09:05.540 --> 09:07.330
We can fight each other,

09:07.330 --> 09:10.540
or we can
destroy this weapon
once and for all.

09:12.880 --> 09:15.170
I understand
your anger.

09:15.170 --> 09:17.460
In many ways,
I feel the same.

09:17.460 --> 09:19.750
But Sabine is right.

09:19.750 --> 09:22.500
Now is not the time
for us to be divisive.

09:22.500 --> 09:24.290
She knows the most
about this weapon

09:24.290 --> 09:26.000
and how to destroy it.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.380
We need her.

09:36.880 --> 09:40.170
It's time for you
to prove your loyalty,

09:40.170 --> 09:44.460
not just to your family,
but to all of Mandalore.

09:58.290 --> 10:00.790
Saxon has worked
hard to keep
the weapon a secret,

10:00.790 --> 10:03.880
so he likely
has it aboard his
Imperial Star Destroyer,

10:03.880 --> 10:05.380
outside of Sundari.

10:05.380 --> 10:08.420
Needless to say,
it will be
very well guarded.

10:08.420 --> 10:11.040
Once we get inside that ship,
we'll need two teams,

10:11.040 --> 10:12.460
one to find the weapon,

10:12.460 --> 10:14.540
and one to wipe out
every shred of data on it

10:14.540 --> 10:16.460
from the Imperial
computer systems.

10:16.460 --> 10:18.500
This weapon...
Is there any way

10:18.500 --> 10:20.420
it could be turned
against the Empire?

10:20.420 --> 10:22.420
I've studied
stormtrooper armor,

10:22.420 --> 10:25.420
and while the thought
has crossed my mind,

10:25.420 --> 10:27.500
that... That
isn't our mission.

10:27.500 --> 10:29.580
No. No, we have
to destroy it.

10:29.580 --> 10:31.500
I will lead
the attack team.

10:31.500 --> 10:34.750
With respect,
Countess, you can
barely hold a blaster.

10:34.750 --> 10:37.540
I'm just as good
with my other hand.

10:37.540 --> 10:40.380
Yes, Mother,
but we'll need you
for tactical support.

10:40.790 --> 10:42.500
So be it.

10:42.500 --> 10:45.330
If I can get
to the weapon, I can
make sure it's destroyed.

10:45.330 --> 10:46.830
I'll get you there.

10:46.830 --> 10:48.960
Ezra and I
will take Chopper
to the data core.

10:48.960 --> 10:51.380
SABINE: All right,
let's go over
our infiltration path.

10:51.380 --> 10:54.170
I'm surprised to see you
so swayed by Sabine Wren.

10:54.170 --> 10:56.460
You seem to be
as impressed
with her as I am.

10:56.460 --> 10:58.540
I had my doubts, Rau,

10:58.540 --> 11:00.120
but she came back
to face her past,

11:00.120 --> 11:02.420
and her bold initiative
has impressed me.

11:02.420 --> 11:05.330
She has become
a courageous leader.

11:05.330 --> 11:08.210
She reminds me
of the best
of who we were

11:08.210 --> 11:12.080
and could inspire us
to become more than
we have been of late.

11:12.080 --> 11:13.960
I will not allow
her efforts
to be wasted.

11:48.540 --> 11:51.540
(SCANNER HUMMING, BEEPS)

11:51.540 --> 11:52.620
I can't help but notice

11:52.620 --> 11:54.420
the weapon's core
isn't here.

11:54.420 --> 11:56.710
SABINE: Thank you,
Fenn Rau. That's helpful.

11:56.710 --> 11:59.080

on The Duchess up there.

BO-KATAN:
"The Duchess"?

12:03.080 --> 12:06.420
You named
your weapon
after my sister?

12:06.420 --> 12:08.250
The former ruler
of Mandalore?

12:08.250 --> 12:10.620
It was a series
of bad decisions, okay?

12:14.540 --> 12:15.380
Hey. Hey!

12:24.830 --> 12:26.710
Bo-Katan and I
will get to the weapon.

12:40.500 --> 12:42.580

complicate things.

12:48.120 --> 12:49.120

so dangerous like this.

13:32.380 --> 13:36.620
You truly are brilliant,
except for thinking

13:36.620 --> 13:39.000
you could infiltrate
my ship unnoticed.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.500
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

Sadly, as much as
I would like
to end your life,

13:48.620 --> 13:50.420
I need you alive.

13:50.420 --> 13:53.500
You are going to upgrade
your little experiment

13:53.500 --> 13:55.750
and deliver a weapon
that operates

13:55.750 --> 13:57.040
at its full potential.

13:58.040 --> 14:00.210
(PANTING) Never!

14:00.210 --> 14:02.540
Let's see
if I can
persuade you.

14:02.540 --> 14:04.670
Governor, stop!
This is too much.

14:04.670 --> 14:07.460
I understand
using the weapon
against rebels,

14:07.460 --> 14:09.290
but if she makes it
more powerful,

14:09.290 --> 14:10.580

a lesson that,
in the end,

you can do better.

You're doing
the right thing, Sabine.
