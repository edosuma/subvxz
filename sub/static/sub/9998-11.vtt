WEBVTT

00:02.410 --> 00:05.913
Okay, folks... show is over!

00:06.372 --> 00:10.375
It's time for Elvis
to leave the building.

00:10.687 --> 00:12.638
It's a long way down, friend.

00:12.871 --> 00:14.906
Oh.

00:16.856 --> 00:18.714
Who are you?

00:18.478 --> 00:20.446
Where the hell
did you come from?

00:20.513 --> 00:22.381
That doesn't matter.

00:22.449 --> 00:24.383
What matters
is you.

00:26.453 --> 00:28.520
Do you understand
you are about to embark

00:28.588 --> 00:30.756
on a course of action
from which there is

00:30.824 --> 00:32.825
no turning back?

00:33.927 --> 00:36.061
Oh, such a waste!

00:36.129 --> 00:39.498
You're so young,
so filled with promise.

00:41.201 --> 00:43.469
Promise?

00:43.520 --> 00:46.872
In the last two weeks,
I've lost my job,

00:46.940 --> 00:50.476
I lost my apartment,
lost a fight...

00:50.543 --> 00:53.579
So if it's promise
that you're looking for...

00:56.549 --> 01:00.286
I think you may have me
confused with someone else.

01:05.025 --> 01:06.625
Michael...

01:06.693 --> 01:08.027
I can help you.

01:08.094 --> 01:10.429
I can show you how to
turn your life around.

01:10.497 --> 01:12.665
How'd you do that?

01:12.732 --> 01:16.769
Weren't you just over there?

01:16.836 --> 01:19.838
And how'd you
know my name?

01:19.906 --> 01:23.776
I know everything.

01:23.843 --> 01:25.644
I can see
everything.

01:27.414 --> 01:30.115
Come on, Michael,
say yes.

01:30.183 --> 01:33.052
Say yes to me.
Say yes to success.

01:34.187 --> 01:36.789
Yes to success.

01:36.856 --> 01:40.960
Wow. If it was
only that easy.

01:41.027 --> 01:42.461
But it is.

01:42.529 --> 01:44.463
Come on!

01:44.531 --> 01:46.465
Look at yourself.

01:46.533 --> 01:48.367
What have you got to lose?

01:51.871 --> 01:54.273
Sure.

01:54.341 --> 01:55.874
Absolutely!

01:55.942 --> 01:58.744
Yes!

01:58.795 --> 01:59.979
Yes to suc...

02:09.489 --> 02:10.823
Everything okay?

02:10.889 --> 02:15.561
Yeah.
Just had a horrible dream.

02:15.612 --> 02:17.429
My brother Michael.

02:17.497 --> 02:19.531
I'm worried; I think
he might be in trouble.

02:19.599 --> 02:21.900
You needed a dream
to tell you that?

Yo?

03:22.069 --> 03:23.869
Is that you?
Is this Michael?

03:23.937 --> 03:26.172
I don't know. Who is this?

03:26.239 --> 03:28.174
It's your sister Allison.

03:28.241 --> 03:29.942
Hey, Al!

03:30.010 --> 03:31.077
That is so weird.

03:31.144 --> 03:33.012
I was just going to call you.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.113
After I landed.

03:34.181 --> 03:35.281
Landed?

03:35.348 --> 03:37.083
Are you traveling somewhere?

03:37.150 --> 03:38.084
Yeah, for work.

03:38.151 --> 03:40.052
In fact, I'm going to Phoenix.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.488
That's why I was
going to call you.

03:42.556 --> 03:43.489
You sound good.

03:43.557 --> 03:46.425
You sound happy.

03:46.493 --> 03:47.726
Did you say work?

03:47.794 --> 03:48.727
Yeah, work.

03:48.795 --> 03:49.995
And I am good.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.098
I... I'm happy.

03:52.165 --> 03:55.768
I have a great new job,
a great new life.

03:55.836 --> 03:59.438
So you're not...
depressed or anything?

03:59.506 --> 04:00.840
No.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.374
Why? Should I be?

04:02.442 --> 04:04.310
MAN
Now boarding Flight 72404...

04:04.361 --> 04:05.611
Oh!

04:05.678 --> 04:07.146
Hey, sorry, Al, uh,
my plane's taking off.

04:07.197 --> 04:08.147
I'm gonna have to run.

04:08.215 --> 04:09.782
Hey, when am I going to see you?

04:09.850 --> 04:11.717
What are you doing
for dinner tonight?

04:11.785 --> 04:12.918
I don't know.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.320
What are you
doing for dinner tonight?

04:14.387 --> 04:16.922
Well, come by the house--
around 7:00.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.390
All right, you got it.

04:18.458 --> 04:20.159
Okay, fly safe.

04:22.796 --> 04:24.864
Hey. Hey, sorry I'm late.

04:24.931 --> 04:27.833
Uh, I rushed over
as soon as Devalos called.

04:29.636 --> 04:31.504
Oh, my God.

04:31.571 --> 04:33.339
Ask me if we have
a cause of death.

04:33.406 --> 04:34.390
Okay.

04:34.474 --> 04:35.908
Do we have
a cause of death?

04:35.976 --> 04:37.743
Oh, yeah. Several.

04:37.811 --> 04:39.678
Broken neck, broken back,
punctured lung,

04:39.746 --> 04:43.082
and two or three others I can't
think of off the top of my head.

04:43.150 --> 04:45.017
And all accomplished without
the use of a weapon.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.720
You mean somebody did this
with their bare hands?

04:47.787 --> 04:48.954
That's what the folks

04:49.022 --> 04:50.406
at the medical examiner's
are telling me,

04:50.490 --> 04:53.108
so obviously we're looking
for a very big boy.

04:54.411 --> 04:56.028
His name was Warren Cheswick.

04:56.096 --> 04:57.496
None of his
valuables are missing,

04:57.564 --> 04:59.031
no signs of forced entry.

04:59.099 --> 05:02.401
Neighbors said he's
an absolute peach.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.270
What a horrible
way to die.

05:04.337 --> 05:05.938
Yeah.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.673
Ordinarily, I wouldn't
pull you in so early;

05:07.741 --> 05:09.875
it's just with these new
Charlie Dalton For Mayor ads

05:09.943 --> 05:11.477
that started running
on TV last night...

05:11.545 --> 05:14.213
What are you talking about?
What ads?

05:14.264 --> 05:16.048
You haven't seen 'em?
Oh, you'll love 'em.

05:16.116 --> 05:18.384
According to these ads,
Manny's soft on crime.

05:18.451 --> 05:20.986
Just a big bleeding heart
wearing a fancy suit.

05:21.054 --> 05:23.722
Needless to say, the sooner we
catch the guy who did this,

05:23.790 --> 05:25.925
and turn him over
to Manny, the better.

05:25.992 --> 05:29.361
You know I'm happy to try,
but I'm not very good at this.

05:29.429 --> 05:31.263
I mean, whenever I
go looking for clues,

05:31.331 --> 05:33.465
I almost never find any.

05:33.533 --> 05:36.502
I just... you know,
I'm not a Geiger counter.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.571
Yes, ma'am.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.786
Sorry I'm not a Geiger counter.

06:20.747 --> 06:22.414
Lee!

06:22.482 --> 06:24.366
Find some uranium?

06:24.451 --> 06:27.036
The man that we, we just found
murdered in this room,

06:27.120 --> 06:29.588
I-I-I, I just saw him
taking pictures of a girl

06:29.656 --> 06:32.658
that he had...
he had bound and gagged.

06:32.709 --> 06:35.261
She was... she was dying,

06:35.328 --> 06:37.129
he kept taking pictures
of her, and then he,

06:37.197 --> 06:39.131
he hid the camera
in that book over there.

06:39.999 --> 06:41.467
There.

07:00.053 --> 07:03.389
He's got pictures of at least

07:03.456 --> 07:05.357
three other
girls in here.

07:05.408 --> 07:10.162
I guess Warren Cheswick wasn't
such a peach after all.

07:10.230 --> 07:13.699
<i>Manuel Devalos says he's</i>
<i>the law and order candidate.</i>

07:13.767 --> 07:15.801
<i>But let's look at the facts.</i>

07:15.869 --> 07:18.137
<i>Homicides in Phoenix</i>
<i>are up 12%</i>

07:18.204 --> 07:19.905
over the last four years.

07:19.973 --> 07:23.208
Gun violence is up 14%.

07:23.276 --> 07:26.512
Does that sound like
law and order to you?

07:26.579 --> 07:29.281
Charlie Dalton for Mayor.
Real law.

07:29.349 --> 07:30.382
Real order.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.785
I don't know.

07:32.852 --> 07:35.354
Sounds kind of desperate,
if you ask me.

07:35.422 --> 07:36.689
Mr. District Attorney...

07:36.740 --> 07:40.392
Charlie Dalton has been a
councilman for... half a term.

07:40.443 --> 07:42.728
He's got no record to speak of,
so he's attacking mine.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.296
People see through
this kind of thing.

07:44.364 --> 07:46.565
Look, Manny, you know the
numbers aren't encouraging.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.067
We're down.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.935
And this gap is only
going to get bigger

07:50.003 --> 07:51.620
once this ad goes
into heavy rotation.

07:51.705 --> 07:54.306
We need to hit back.
We have to hit back.

07:54.374 --> 07:56.475
I told you when
I hired you, Justine,

07:56.543 --> 07:59.261
I won't indulge in negative
campaigning. I know,

07:59.346 --> 08:00.679
which is why, up until now,

08:00.747 --> 08:02.931
we have run a very
polite campaign.

08:03.016 --> 08:05.517
a very polite,
ineffective campaign.

08:09.556 --> 08:11.623
Can I ask you something?

08:11.691 --> 08:13.659
As long as you're
polite about it.

08:13.727 --> 08:16.295
Allison DuBois--
why aren't we using her?

08:16.363 --> 08:18.564
What do you mean, "using her"?
Using her how?

08:18.631 --> 08:21.500
Well, for starters, we could
give her everything we have

08:21.568 --> 08:24.169
on Charlie Dalton and see
what she comes up with.

08:24.237 --> 08:25.838
Who knows? Maybe she'll
dream about something

08:25.905 --> 08:27.373
that we can use
against him.

08:27.440 --> 08:28.741
Absolutely not.

08:28.808 --> 08:31.043
I like that.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.910
Speaking without thinking.

08:32.962 --> 08:35.179
Very desirable in
a public official.

08:36.950 --> 08:41.186
Look... with all due respect,
Mr. District Attorney,

08:41.254 --> 08:43.155
what is your
problem with winning?

08:43.222 --> 08:45.891
I don't have a problem
with winning, Ms. Godrich.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.259
I do have a problem

08:47.327 --> 08:48.927
with compromising
friends and colleagues.

08:48.995 --> 08:50.996
Allison DuBois is
an employee of this city,

08:51.064 --> 08:52.531
not my campaign.

08:52.599 --> 08:55.517
So how about we stop wasting
time and energy figuring out

08:55.602 --> 08:57.169
how we can stoop to
Charlie Dalton's level,

08:57.237 --> 08:59.338
and see what we can
do to focus the voters

08:59.406 --> 09:01.974
on the issues that actually
matter in this election?

09:03.610 --> 09:05.327
Yes, sir.

09:05.412 --> 09:06.978
No Allison DuBois.

09:07.030 --> 09:08.280
Change the focus.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.332
Thank you.

09:14.921 --> 09:16.889
200 envelopes, Ms. Godrich.

09:16.956 --> 09:19.024
Stuffed and ready to go.

09:19.092 --> 09:21.627
Would you like me to take
these to the mail room?

09:23.630 --> 09:25.631
No.

09:28.635 --> 09:30.235
Uh, you've been working
on the campaign

09:30.303 --> 09:31.720
for a while now,
huh, Bridgette?

09:31.805 --> 09:33.472
About three weeks.

09:33.540 --> 09:34.540
Why do you ask?

09:34.607 --> 09:38.243
Eh, well, I was just
thinking that maybe,

09:38.311 --> 09:41.079
uh, maybe a little
promotion was in order.

09:43.183 --> 09:44.566
Ta-da!

09:44.651 --> 09:46.185
Oh, look at you!

09:46.252 --> 09:48.370
Oh, look at you,
look at you, look at you.

09:48.455 --> 09:50.989
Give me a hug,
already.

09:51.057 --> 09:53.125
Wow, nice suit! What'd
you do, mug an undertaker?

09:53.193 --> 09:54.743
Yeah, I know I'm a
little overdressed,

09:54.828 --> 09:57.663
but I came here right from work
'cause I didn't want to be late.

09:57.730 --> 09:59.298
I'm sorry, you
came from where?

09:59.365 --> 10:01.133
Yeah, I know.
I know.

10:01.201 --> 10:02.935
Come in!
Thanks.

10:03.002 --> 10:04.386
If you'd told me a year ago

10:04.471 --> 10:06.405
I'd be working as
a pharmaceutical rep,

10:06.473 --> 10:08.006
I would've laughed
in your face.

10:08.074 --> 10:11.009
I mean, if you'd told me a year
ago I'd be working at all,

10:11.077 --> 10:12.444
I would've laughed.

10:12.512 --> 10:14.746
So what is it
you actually do?

10:14.814 --> 10:17.916
Well, basically,
I sell drugs to doctors.

10:17.984 --> 10:20.085
Are you a
drug dealer?

10:20.153 --> 10:21.620
Marie!

10:21.688 --> 10:23.188
Well, kind of, but...

10:23.256 --> 10:25.457
the kind of drugs I sell
are the kind you take

10:25.525 --> 10:27.125
when you're sick
and trying to get better.

10:27.193 --> 10:28.794
So how'd you hear
about this job?

10:28.862 --> 10:30.445
Did you see an ad
in the paper?

10:30.530 --> 10:33.999
Uh, heard about it
through a friend.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.134
A friend? Who?

10:37.670 --> 10:39.671
Ooh, ooh, it's past 9:00.

10:39.739 --> 10:41.206
Ah, busted.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.775
All right. Come on, girls.

10:43.843 --> 10:46.111
Say good night to
your uncle Michael.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.113
Girls, I'll check
in on you.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.648
Good night, sweetie.

10:49.716 --> 10:51.717
Love you,
sweetheart.

10:57.390 --> 11:00.025
All right, quit staring at me.

11:00.093 --> 11:03.795
I'm sorry, I'll... I'll try.

11:03.863 --> 11:06.431
I just been worried about you.

11:06.499 --> 11:07.633
I dreamt about you.

11:07.700 --> 11:09.101
Uh-oh.

11:09.168 --> 11:10.669
That's never good.

11:10.737 --> 11:13.539
You were pretty messed up.

11:13.606 --> 11:17.109
You were standing
on this bridge.

11:19.145 --> 11:23.415
Yeah, well... I've stood
on a few bridges in my time,

11:23.483 --> 11:27.519
but don't worry,
I'm not that guy anymore.

11:27.587 --> 11:30.856
In my dream, this guy showed up.

11:30.924 --> 11:32.424
He talked you out of it.

11:32.492 --> 11:33.592
Is he the one?

11:33.660 --> 11:35.827
Is he the one who told you
about this job,

11:35.895 --> 11:38.130
who helped you straighten up?

11:38.197 --> 11:40.198
Hey, look.

11:42.201 --> 11:43.602
<i>The Best You</i>
<i>You Can Be.</i>

11:45.004 --> 11:45.938
Yeah, turn it over.

11:45.989 --> 11:47.739
Do you recognize him?

11:47.807 --> 11:48.974
I sure do.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.443
Hey, thanks for
helping my brother.

11:53.079 --> 11:54.713
Carson Churchill.

11:54.781 --> 11:57.950
Yeah, he'd written, like,
15 books before he died.

11:58.017 --> 12:01.587
He's helped thousands of people,
and now he just helps me.

12:01.654 --> 12:03.055
Still?

12:03.122 --> 12:04.122
Every day.

12:04.190 --> 12:05.290
Mom!

12:05.358 --> 12:06.925
All right.

12:06.993 --> 12:08.860
Looks like
you're needed.

12:08.928 --> 12:12.497
I'll, um, go and say
good night with you

12:12.565 --> 12:14.166
and then head back
to the hotel.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.435
Hotel? Aren't you
staying on the couch?

12:16.502 --> 12:19.838
No. Like I said, I'm...
I'm not that guy anymore.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.974
But I got an extra key,
so if the kids

12:22.008 --> 12:23.942
want to come use the pool
after school tomorrow.

12:25.979 --> 12:27.679
<i>Let me get this straight.</i>

12:27.747 --> 12:30.315
Your little brother's got
himself a dead life coach?

12:30.383 --> 12:32.284
Or should I say,
a life coach who's dead.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.252
Or maybe I got it right
the first time.

12:34.320 --> 12:35.754
Stop it.
That's not funny.

12:35.822 --> 12:37.089
Really? I don't know.

12:37.156 --> 12:39.925
Speaking only for myself,
I find this very amusing.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.994
My brother really believes
in this guy.

12:46.466 --> 12:49.067
"My life is my success,
my success is my life."

12:49.135 --> 12:50.669
What does that
actually mean?

12:50.737 --> 12:53.538
Oh, wait, I didn't read
the most important part.

12:53.606 --> 12:58.110
"$14.99. Also available in
audio book and e-book formats."

12:58.177 --> 13:00.979
Sorry, but I'm very dubious
about people who charge money

13:01.047 --> 13:03.215
to tell you how to
succeed in life,

13:03.282 --> 13:04.783
when their secret
is so obvious.

13:04.851 --> 13:06.218
Oh, really? It's obvious?

13:06.285 --> 13:07.903
Sure, just charge
people like your brother

13:07.987 --> 13:09.121
money for the secret.

13:09.188 --> 13:10.389
You know,
you're not being fair.

13:10.456 --> 13:11.857
There's some pretty interesting
things in here.

13:11.924 --> 13:13.025
Like what?

13:13.092 --> 13:17.029
Like, "Success comes
from good judgment,

13:17.096 --> 13:20.265
"good judgment
comes from experience,

13:20.333 --> 13:22.501
experience comes from
bad judgment."

13:22.568 --> 13:24.736
Well, if that's true, then
your brother is gonna be

13:24.804 --> 13:27.139
the most successful
man on the planet.

13:27.206 --> 13:29.207
I'm just saying,

13:29.275 --> 13:32.411
life is a, is a long-distance
run, not a one-month sprint.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.913
And I, for one, am not
breaking out the champagne

13:34.964 --> 13:36.214
for your brother.

13:36.265 --> 13:37.916
Not yet.

13:47.293 --> 13:50.128
Nerve-racking, isn't it?

13:53.616 --> 13:57.936
Just remember, she's just
as nervous as you are.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.873
Everyone else he's interviewed
for the position

14:01.941 --> 14:03.809
was just as nervous
as you are.

14:03.876 --> 14:05.043
This is crazy.

14:05.111 --> 14:06.978
I'm never gonna
get this job.

14:07.046 --> 14:08.847
In case you
haven't heard,

14:08.915 --> 14:10.082
I'm a loser.

14:10.149 --> 14:12.300
You know, when I walk
down the street,

14:12.385 --> 14:14.019
beggars give me money.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.353
Look at my resume.

14:15.421 --> 14:17.556
It's got more holes in
it than a golf course.

14:17.623 --> 14:21.193
None of that matters.

14:21.260 --> 14:22.227
Not today.

14:22.294 --> 14:24.863
Everyone's a loser
at some point.

14:24.931 --> 14:29.367
Some people just choose
not to accept it.

14:29.435 --> 14:32.504
My birth name's not
Carson Churchill.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.906
It's Hobart Carson.

14:34.974 --> 14:37.275
Hobie Carson.

14:38.411 --> 14:42.214
I chose to become
Carson Churchill.

14:42.281 --> 14:45.484
Just like you are choosing
to become somebody else today.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.088
I don't know.

14:50.156 --> 14:52.624
Okay, Michael.

14:52.675 --> 14:55.160
I need you to do
something for me.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.229
Close your eyes.

14:59.265 --> 15:02.267
Now take a deep breath.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.606
Look, I am trying
to get a job here,

15:07.673 --> 15:09.074
I'm not trying to
give birth, okay?

15:09.142 --> 15:12.043
I am trying
to help you relax.

15:12.111 --> 15:14.112
Now close your eyes.

15:18.151 --> 15:21.453
Breathe in
through your mouth...

15:21.521 --> 15:23.555
and out through your nose.

15:25.558 --> 15:27.559
One more time.

15:35.234 --> 15:36.568
Talk to you soon.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.053
Look forward to it.

15:38.137 --> 15:39.054
Nice.

15:40.756 --> 15:43.642
It seems you hit it
out of the park in there.

15:43.709 --> 15:47.078
What the hell
just happened?

15:47.146 --> 15:48.547
I helped you a little.

15:48.614 --> 15:50.916
I hope you don't mind.

15:50.983 --> 15:53.118
What do you
mean "helped"?

15:53.186 --> 15:55.954
I don't even remember
having the interview.

15:56.022 --> 16:00.125
I helped you relax,
then when you loosened up a bit,

16:00.193 --> 16:04.446
I, uh, took the wheel
for a while.

16:04.530 --> 16:06.431
I jumped in.

16:06.499 --> 16:07.999
I took the controls.

16:09.735 --> 16:13.071
I did the interview for you.

16:13.139 --> 16:15.173
And I was brilliant.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.244
What do you mean,
"took the controls"?

16:19.312 --> 16:20.879
Is that even possible?

16:20.930 --> 16:23.715
Mm, tricky, but doable.

16:23.766 --> 16:27.886
It's easier if you're relaxed,
you know, open to the process.

16:27.937 --> 16:29.938
And you can't
argue with results.

16:30.022 --> 16:32.824
Uh, but here's
the thing, though.

16:32.892 --> 16:36.828
You got a brand-new job now,
you got promise,

16:36.896 --> 16:39.331
but if you're gonna
be a success at it,

16:39.398 --> 16:41.299
you're gonna need my help.

16:41.367 --> 16:42.300
Don't I know it.

16:42.368 --> 16:43.702
But I'm not finished yet.

16:43.769 --> 16:47.672
My willingness to help you
is conditional.

16:47.740 --> 16:51.076
I need a little quid pro quo.

16:51.143 --> 16:53.078
Uh, you want to push

16:53.145 --> 16:57.015
the elevator
button, Michael?

16:57.083 --> 17:00.552
What kind of quid pro quo
are you talking about?

17:00.619 --> 17:04.556
I died before my life's
work was finished.

17:04.624 --> 17:08.727
I got things I need to do,
people I need to inspire.

17:08.794 --> 17:13.064
And to do that,
I need a body.

17:13.132 --> 17:15.032
Your body,
to be exact.

17:15.101 --> 17:16.367
My body?

17:16.435 --> 17:17.502
Yeah.

17:17.569 --> 17:20.571
Uh, the thing is,
I'm kind of using it now.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.040
No, no, I know.

17:22.108 --> 17:26.044
What I'm proposing
is, um...

17:26.112 --> 17:30.849
I guess you'd call it a
time-share arrangement.

17:30.917 --> 17:33.785
I help you with
your career,

17:33.853 --> 17:36.121
we build a new and
better Michael Benoit,

17:36.188 --> 17:37.689
and in exchange,

17:37.757 --> 17:41.676
you let me... get
behind the wheel.

17:41.761 --> 17:43.895
For a couple hours,
every now and then.

17:47.266 --> 17:49.601
You want me
to loan my body to you?

17:59.956 --> 18:02.490
- Sis.
-  Okay, who am I talking to?

18:02.542 --> 18:03.492
Right now.

18:03.559 --> 18:05.293
Are you you or are you him?

18:05.361 --> 18:06.452
What the hell are you--

18:06.520 --> 18:08.587
Are you Carson
or are you Michael?

18:10.182 --> 18:12.667
Have you completely
lost your mind?!

18:13.186 --> 18:16.188
I think you are making way
too big a deal out of this.

18:16.272 --> 18:18.206
Am I?
Hey, is that even possible?

18:18.274 --> 18:21.409
You've given control of your
body to another person, Michael.

18:21.477 --> 18:23.445
I don't think there's any
bigger deal than that,

18:23.512 --> 18:24.696
or a dumber one.

18:24.780 --> 18:27.349
It's not dumb,
it's business, okay?

18:27.416 --> 18:29.784
He helps me,
I help him, end of story.

18:29.852 --> 18:31.786
He could do anything
when he's in control!

18:31.854 --> 18:32.854
Anything.

18:32.922 --> 18:35.240
Doesn't that even concern you?

18:40.413 --> 18:41.997
This is what he's doing.

18:42.048 --> 18:46.251
This is what he's using me for:
his new book.

18:54.477 --> 18:57.646
After he died, he knew
he had another book in him,

18:57.713 --> 19:00.782
but he had no way of writing it
until he met me.

19:00.850 --> 19:02.934
He types, Allison.
That's what he does.

19:03.019 --> 19:04.186
While I'm sleeping,

19:04.237 --> 19:06.288
he takes over my body,
and he types.

19:06.355 --> 19:07.722
He types?

19:07.790 --> 19:09.658
Yeah.

19:09.742 --> 19:12.427
While I'm sleeping.

19:14.030 --> 19:15.447
That's the only catch.

19:15.531 --> 19:18.333
He can only take over the wheel
when I'm completely relaxed.

19:18.401 --> 19:20.669
But the nice thing is...

19:20.736 --> 19:23.205
I never feel
as if I've lost any time.

19:23.272 --> 19:26.041
So now you know everything.

19:26.108 --> 19:28.443
You know, in a couple weeks,
once he's finished,

19:28.511 --> 19:31.813
I'll miraculously discover
his completed manuscript

19:31.881 --> 19:33.548
at a yard sale or something.

19:33.616 --> 19:36.384
I'll take it to his
old publisher who can sell it,

19:36.452 --> 19:38.453
and then Carson
will get the credit,

19:38.521 --> 19:40.455
his widow
will get the cash,

19:40.523 --> 19:43.225
and after that,
we are done.

19:43.292 --> 19:45.327
Say something.

19:49.448 --> 19:50.732
Hello.

19:50.800 --> 19:53.134
Lee.

19:53.202 --> 19:54.836
Yeah.

19:54.904 --> 19:57.739
Okay, I can be there
in about 15 minutes. See you.

19:57.790 --> 19:59.307
It's work. I got to go.

19:59.375 --> 20:01.376
Believe me, I understand.

20:03.546 --> 20:05.814
What can
I tell you?

20:05.881 --> 20:08.149
You got me?

20:08.217 --> 20:11.186
I killed Warren Cheswick,
and I'd do it again.

20:11.254 --> 20:12.787
He had it coming.

20:12.855 --> 20:14.923
Why do you say that,
Mr. Bumgarner?

20:15.891 --> 20:17.892
He murdered my sister.

20:24.233 --> 20:26.568
Carla Bumgarner.

20:26.636 --> 20:28.470
She disappeared three years ago.

20:28.537 --> 20:31.806
You guys claimed you never
figured out who took her.

20:31.874 --> 20:33.975
But when I found out
the truth...

20:35.845 --> 20:38.013
Well, you know the rest.

20:38.080 --> 20:40.015
Wait a second.

20:40.082 --> 20:43.251
What do you mean, the truth?

20:43.319 --> 20:45.120
Warren Cheswick
was never a suspect

20:45.187 --> 20:47.722
in your sister's disappearance,
or in any crime, for the matter.

20:47.790 --> 20:51.293
We had no idea what he was up to
until we found him dead.

20:51.360 --> 20:54.296
Well, maybe
you didn't suspect Cheswick,

20:54.363 --> 20:56.931
but someone at the Phoenix PD
sure as hell did.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.868
What are you talking about?

20:59.935 --> 21:01.336
A few days ago,

21:01.404 --> 21:04.039
I was in the waiting room
of my cardiologist's office.

21:04.106 --> 21:08.076
Takes a lot supplements
to get a body like this.

21:08.144 --> 21:09.711
Left me with a bad heart.

21:09.779 --> 21:12.747
Doc says, without a transplant,
I'll be lucky to see 50.

21:12.815 --> 21:15.717
Anyway, there's this other
guy waiting that day,

21:15.785 --> 21:17.152
and we got to talking.

21:17.219 --> 21:20.221
Said he used to be a detective
with the Phoenix PD.

21:20.289 --> 21:22.290
Had to retire
after a heart attack.

21:22.358 --> 21:25.160
Anyway, he recognizes my
last name-- Bumgarner.

21:25.227 --> 21:27.262
Not easy to forget, right?

21:27.330 --> 21:30.332
Said he worked, uh,
Carla's case.

21:30.399 --> 21:31.766
That it was a shame

21:31.834 --> 21:34.436
that you guys couldn't take
down the guy who did it.

21:34.503 --> 21:36.538
You knew it was Cheswick,

21:36.605 --> 21:38.973
but you just couldn't
pin it on him.

21:39.041 --> 21:40.875
What was this officer's name?

21:42.712 --> 21:45.513
Uh, Federer.

21:45.581 --> 21:48.817
Isaac Federer, I think.

21:52.288 --> 21:53.571
It's weird.

21:53.656 --> 21:54.906
What's that?

21:54.990 --> 21:56.424
You know, I worked
the disappearance

21:56.492 --> 21:57.609
of Carla Bumgarner.

21:57.693 --> 21:59.494
I don't remember anyone
named Isaac Federer

21:59.561 --> 22:00.829
on that task force.

22:00.896 --> 22:02.464
As a matter of fact,
I can't remember

22:02.531 --> 22:05.633
ever meeting a detective
named Isaac Federer.

22:08.437 --> 22:10.438
I'm home.

22:12.641 --> 22:15.510
Keep your applause to a minimum.

22:16.545 --> 22:17.912
Hello, Bridge.

22:17.963 --> 22:19.247
Where's Mom?

22:19.298 --> 22:21.383
She and Marie went to go
get chicken for dinner.

22:21.450 --> 22:22.717
Chicken! Excellent.

22:22.768 --> 22:24.152
What you got going on here?

22:24.220 --> 22:25.487
What is this, homework?

22:25.554 --> 22:28.123
No. This is all
for the campaign.

22:28.190 --> 22:30.024
Actually, I got a promotion.

22:30.092 --> 22:32.227
Really!
Yep.

22:32.294 --> 22:34.195
The lady who's running
the campaign gave me

22:34.263 --> 22:37.265
all this stuff about the man
Mr. Devalos is running against.

22:37.333 --> 22:39.634
She wants to see
if I can dream about him.

22:39.702 --> 22:41.503
Really.

22:41.570 --> 22:43.805
Does your mom know about this?

22:43.873 --> 22:45.573
No.

22:45.641 --> 22:48.376
<i>Manuel Devalos is going to be</i>
<i>the next mayor of Phoenix.</i>

22:48.444 --> 22:51.212
You can either get on board now,
or you can miss the boat.

22:51.280 --> 22:52.547
It's your call.

22:52.615 --> 22:55.049
Yeah, I don't call that number
getting on board.

22:55.117 --> 22:57.419
You're going to have to dig
a little deeper.

22:57.486 --> 23:00.455
Yeah, well, keep digging.

23:00.523 --> 23:02.524
Uh, you know what?
I have to call you back.

23:02.591 --> 23:04.559
Is everything
all right?

23:04.627 --> 23:06.361
I don't know.

23:06.429 --> 23:08.263
Did you actually ask
a 12-year-old girl

23:08.330 --> 23:10.965
to help us find information
we could use against Dalton?

23:12.201 --> 23:13.968
What's the issue, Manuel?

23:14.036 --> 23:15.403
She's not an employee.

23:15.471 --> 23:17.205
She's 12.

23:17.273 --> 23:18.840
Gosh.

23:18.908 --> 23:20.642
I just thought she
was kind of short.

23:22.111 --> 23:24.579
So did she see something?

23:24.647 --> 23:26.281
Wow.

23:26.348 --> 23:28.783
You really don't
have a problem with this.

23:28.851 --> 23:32.120
With what? Wanting to win?

23:32.188 --> 23:34.088
Let me tell you
a little something

23:34.156 --> 23:35.924
about elections,
Mr. District Attorney.

23:35.991 --> 23:38.326
And I know you've been
through your fair share of them,

23:38.394 --> 23:40.728
but you only have to think
about it every four years.

23:40.796 --> 23:44.699
Me? This is my job all year,
every year.

23:44.767 --> 23:46.634
No one is going
to remember you

23:46.702 --> 23:48.436
for the wonderful
campaign you ran.

23:48.504 --> 23:50.405
They're only going
to remember you for winning

23:50.473 --> 23:52.907
or, worse still, losing.

23:52.975 --> 23:55.210
You're down ten points, Manny.

23:55.277 --> 23:56.711
Ten.

23:56.779 --> 23:58.780
So, what's it going to be?

23:58.848 --> 24:01.115
Do you want to be
the next mayor of Phoenix,

24:01.183 --> 24:04.285
or are you running
for Miss Congeniality?

24:07.256 --> 24:09.724
<i>Hardly a day goes by</i>

24:09.792 --> 24:11.059
I don't think
about him.

24:11.126 --> 24:13.261
That son of a bitch that
killed your sister.

24:13.329 --> 24:14.963
We knew it was him.

24:15.030 --> 24:17.465
Those bureaucrats at
the prosecutor's office

24:17.533 --> 24:20.502
told us we didn't have
enough evidence to convict.

24:20.569 --> 24:22.136
But trust me.

24:22.204 --> 24:26.374
A cop knows when he's
looking at his perp.

24:26.442 --> 24:28.977
So this guy got a name?

24:29.044 --> 24:30.945
The one you're certain
killed my sister.

24:31.013 --> 24:32.947
Yeah, he's
got a name.

24:33.015 --> 24:35.316
Warren Cheswick.

24:45.644 --> 24:47.912
Al, what are
you doing here?

24:47.980 --> 24:51.383
Does the name Jason Bumgarner
mean anything to you?

24:51.825 --> 24:53.426
How about Warren Cheswick?

24:54.461 --> 24:55.895
No. Never heard of him.

24:55.963 --> 24:57.230
Never heard of
either of them.

24:57.297 --> 24:59.031
And I imagine
you don't remember going

24:59.099 --> 25:00.900
to a cardiologist
a few days ago?

25:00.968 --> 25:02.968
Three days ago... nope.

25:03.020 --> 25:05.004
Three days ago was
all headshrinkers.

25:05.072 --> 25:06.706
Your friend Carson
is lying to you.

25:06.774 --> 25:09.075
When he takes over,
he's not just typing.

25:09.143 --> 25:10.743
Three days ago,
he went

25:10.811 --> 25:12.044
into a cardiologist's office.

25:12.112 --> 25:14.414
He talked to this man,
Jason Bumgarner.

25:14.481 --> 25:17.250
He was inhabiting your body
when he did it.

25:17.317 --> 25:20.086
Okay, so maybe he knows
this Bumgarner guy

25:20.153 --> 25:21.754
from when he was alive.
No, Michael.

25:21.822 --> 25:24.006
Carson pretended he
was a police officer.

25:24.091 --> 25:26.692
He told Bumgarner he knew
the name of the man

25:26.760 --> 25:29.662
who killed his sister--
a man named Warren Cheswick.

25:29.730 --> 25:32.365
And the next day,
Bumgarner killed Cheswick.

25:32.433 --> 25:34.901
Michael, you gotta...
you gotta put a stop to this.

25:34.968 --> 25:37.937
You gotta tell him
that this deal is off.

25:38.005 --> 25:39.605
Why?
I just told you why.

25:39.673 --> 25:42.225
He used you
to get somebody killed.

25:42.309 --> 25:45.044
No, he used me to get
a murderer killed.

25:45.112 --> 25:47.046
That's what you
just said, right?

25:47.114 --> 25:50.316
That this one guy murdered
the other guy's sister?

25:50.384 --> 25:51.901
That's not the point.

25:51.985 --> 25:53.619
Well, it is to me.

25:53.687 --> 25:55.521
So maybe Carson was just trying

25:55.589 --> 25:58.458
to bring this guy's sister
a little justice.

25:58.525 --> 26:00.326
Is that such a bad thing?

26:00.394 --> 26:02.028
Yes. Yes. It's a very bad thing.

26:02.095 --> 26:04.196
He might have made you
an accessory to murder.

26:04.248 --> 26:05.531
I don't think so.

26:05.582 --> 26:07.333
All I did was
say something to somebody.

26:07.384 --> 26:09.735
The rest of it--
that was their doing.

26:09.803 --> 26:13.172
Michael, I know you respect him,

26:13.223 --> 26:15.975
I know that he's done
a lot for you,

26:16.043 --> 26:18.478
but he's not being honest
with you.

26:19.513 --> 26:20.913
Well, I disagree.

26:21.949 --> 26:23.266
So, I'm sorry if you

26:23.350 --> 26:24.884
don't like what's
going on here,

26:24.952 --> 26:27.153
but I'm not backing
out of anything.

26:27.221 --> 26:30.189
I owe this guy too much.

26:34.428 --> 26:35.928
Yes?

26:35.996 --> 26:37.997
The lady at security
said you wanted

26:38.064 --> 26:40.266
to see me when
I got in.

26:40.334 --> 26:42.435
Please, have a seat, Bridgette.

26:42.503 --> 26:44.637
Listen.

26:44.705 --> 26:47.807
I just wanted to apologize about
what happened the other day.

26:47.875 --> 26:50.243
Ms. Godrich should never
have asked you to look

26:50.310 --> 26:52.778
for information that we could
use against Charlie Dalton.

26:52.846 --> 26:53.946
That's okay.

26:54.014 --> 26:55.515
No, it isn't.

26:55.582 --> 26:58.117
But I just wanted to tell you
how much I really appreciate

26:58.185 --> 26:59.886
the work you're doing
on my campaign.

26:59.953 --> 27:01.854
And, provided you still
feel comfortable here,

27:01.922 --> 27:04.056
I'd very much like you
to stay on.

27:04.124 --> 27:07.326
Sure. It's not as if
I was going anyplace.

27:07.394 --> 27:10.796
And besides, I think you're
going to be a great mayor.

27:10.864 --> 27:12.131
Thank you.

27:12.199 --> 27:14.000
Coming from you,
that means a lot.

27:17.604 --> 27:18.971
Is there something else?

27:19.039 --> 27:22.174
Actually, there is.

27:22.242 --> 27:24.744
You know, I did see something

27:24.811 --> 27:27.813
when I was looking at that
stuff that lady gave me.

27:27.881 --> 27:29.148
Now that I've seen it,

27:29.216 --> 27:31.918
I can't exactly unsee it,
you know?

27:31.985 --> 27:33.986
Well, maybe you can't unsee it,

27:34.054 --> 27:36.556
but I can still choose
not to ask you about it.

27:36.623 --> 27:38.925
It's just not how I want
to win this election.

27:38.992 --> 27:42.261
But what if you end up losing
'cause I didn't tell you?

27:43.397 --> 27:44.964
That's a risk I'm willing
to take.

27:45.032 --> 27:47.733
If Charlie Dalton has
a few skeletons in his closet,

27:47.801 --> 27:49.869
well, I'm willing
to leave them there.

27:49.937 --> 27:51.304
But that's the thing.

27:51.371 --> 27:53.806
What if I told you
he's not the only one

27:53.874 --> 27:56.142
with skeletons you need
to worry about?

27:58.178 --> 28:00.947
Oh, wow.

28:01.014 --> 28:04.116
I don't mean to
intrude, but, uh...

28:04.184 --> 28:06.886
you look how I feel.

28:08.288 --> 28:10.189
I beg your pardon.

28:10.257 --> 28:12.658
Well, uh, this
bench-- this is where

28:12.726 --> 28:16.028
I usually come when
I've had a crappy day.

28:16.096 --> 28:20.533
So imagine my surprise when
I show up and see someone

28:20.601 --> 28:24.337
who looks just about as
depressed as I feel.

28:24.404 --> 28:28.074
What's the matter,
if you don't mind me asking?

28:29.893 --> 28:33.212
I proposed to my wife
on this bench.

28:35.816 --> 28:37.450
She died two weeks ago.

28:37.517 --> 28:39.452
Oh.

28:39.519 --> 28:41.621
So sorry to hear that.

28:45.092 --> 28:46.909
Thank you.

28:46.994 --> 28:49.412
I'm Ken.
Ken Corrigan.

28:49.496 --> 28:52.031
Carson.

28:52.099 --> 28:54.333
So what happened
to you today?

28:54.401 --> 28:57.770
Ah... just job stuff.

28:57.838 --> 29:00.106
Just stress.
Nothing like your thing.

29:02.092 --> 29:05.011
Mind if I, uh,
de-stress?

29:07.931 --> 29:10.216
Mmm.

29:13.654 --> 29:15.021
Ah.

29:15.072 --> 29:17.406
Want to tip one
back for your wife?

29:23.630 --> 29:25.297
Wish I could.

29:25.365 --> 29:28.284
God, I wish I could.

29:28.368 --> 29:31.504
I'm an alcoholic.

29:31.571 --> 29:36.075
Kathy-- my wife--

29:36.143 --> 29:39.879
she stayed with me
for a decade

29:39.946 --> 29:42.415
when I was
a falling-down drunk.

29:42.482 --> 29:46.285
Been on the wagon
for more than a year now.

29:46.353 --> 29:48.287
Well, suit
yourself, but, uh,

29:48.355 --> 29:50.322
the good thing
about the wagon is,

29:50.390 --> 29:52.591
you can always
get back on.

29:57.497 --> 29:59.298
Yeah.

30:01.768 --> 30:04.203
Just a nip, right?

30:04.270 --> 30:06.839
That's right.

30:25.008 --> 30:26.592
Whoa.

30:26.660 --> 30:28.961
Easy there, champ.

30:30.564 --> 30:32.848
Oh, my God.

30:32.933 --> 30:34.600
What am I doing?

30:35.635 --> 30:37.186
I'm sorry.

30:37.270 --> 30:39.138
I have to go.

30:46.213 --> 30:48.547
Yeah, 911?

30:48.615 --> 30:50.449
I'd like to report
a drunk driver.

30:50.517 --> 30:53.352
He's, uh, pulling out
of Boyd Park right now.

30:53.420 --> 30:56.689
Someone should really pick
him up before he hurts somebody.

30:59.326 --> 31:01.594
<i>Yeah. Ken Corrigan.</i>

31:01.661 --> 31:03.262
Says here that, uh,

31:03.330 --> 31:05.564
the guy blew just over
the limit for a DUI.

31:05.632 --> 31:07.716
Why do you care?
I'm not sure.

31:07.801 --> 31:09.385
What else does it
say in that report?

31:09.469 --> 31:12.738
Corrigan begged the arresting
officer not to write him up.

31:12.806 --> 31:15.107
Apparently, he's, uh,
got a heart condition.

31:15.175 --> 31:17.693
He's on the waiting list
for a transplant.

31:17.778 --> 31:20.079
It turns out the guy's
a recovering alcoholic,

31:20.147 --> 31:22.181
so they won't transplant him
until he spends

31:22.249 --> 31:24.150
a certain amount of time
on the wagon.

31:24.217 --> 31:26.051
The guy says a DUI
would bump him

31:26.119 --> 31:27.720
way back down the waiting list.

31:27.788 --> 31:29.421
Hey, wait a second.

31:29.489 --> 31:32.291
That big guy we arrested
the other day--

31:32.359 --> 31:34.627
the one who killed
Warren Cheswick--

31:34.694 --> 31:36.629
didn't he have
a bad heart?

31:36.696 --> 31:38.898
Wasn't he waiting for
a heart transplant?

31:38.965 --> 31:40.266
That's what he said.

31:40.333 --> 31:41.734
Why do you ask?

31:41.802 --> 31:42.885
I got to run.

31:42.969 --> 31:44.303
Thanks for your
help, Lee.

31:47.674 --> 31:49.208
Uh, I got to talk to you.

31:49.276 --> 31:50.609
About what?

31:50.677 --> 31:53.579
About the fact that Carson
wasn't writing yesterday?

31:53.647 --> 31:55.931
That he was, in
fact, at Boyd Park

31:56.016 --> 31:59.385
trying to talk an alcoholic
into taking a drink?

31:59.452 --> 32:01.754
Yeah, I know
all about it.

32:05.892 --> 32:10.830
They have apps where you can
record things with these phones.

32:10.897 --> 32:12.531
So, before I went to sleep,

32:12.599 --> 32:16.035
I started recording
and just let it keep recording.

32:16.102 --> 32:18.404
I got some pretty
interesting stuff.

32:18.471 --> 32:20.506
MICHAEL The good
thing about the wagon is,

32:20.574 --> 32:22.308
you can always get back on.

32:27.514 --> 32:30.816
Michael, I think
I know what Carson is doing.

32:30.884 --> 32:33.452
I mean, both
of these people

32:33.520 --> 32:35.421
that he's interfering with,
they're both sick.

32:35.488 --> 32:38.791
They're both in line
to get heart transplants.

32:38.859 --> 32:40.442
The thing is, they keep a list

32:40.527 --> 32:42.461
of who's eligible
for those hearts.

32:42.529 --> 32:45.865
And these things that he's
trying to convince them to do--

32:45.932 --> 32:48.934
commit a felony, get a DUI--

32:49.002 --> 32:51.320
they bump you
down the list.

32:53.907 --> 32:56.842
His wife, she's sick.

32:56.910 --> 32:59.845
He told me about it
the first time we met.

32:59.913 --> 33:03.148
She has heart disease
and needs a transplant.

33:03.216 --> 33:05.784
Carson was worried that she
wouldn't be healthy enough

33:05.852 --> 33:08.954
for the operation by the time
a heart became available to her.

33:09.022 --> 33:11.790
So he's trying to move her
up the list.

33:11.858 --> 33:14.193
But how many people are ahead
of her on that list?

33:14.261 --> 33:16.996
Six? 12? 20?

33:17.063 --> 33:19.465
And even if I told them
the deal was off,

33:19.532 --> 33:20.900
what difference does it make?

33:20.967 --> 33:23.302
He's still gonna take over
my body once I fall asleep

33:23.370 --> 33:26.071
whether I allow
him to or not.

33:26.139 --> 33:28.807
How do we stop him?

33:28.875 --> 33:31.944
I have no idea.

33:45.456 --> 33:46.457
I guess I should
have known

33:46.554 --> 33:48.622
he'd end up on
our couch eventually.

33:49.561 --> 33:51.629
They just go together.

33:51.680 --> 33:53.281
Hey, he needs
this right now.

33:53.348 --> 33:54.338
He's devastated.

33:54.372 --> 33:54.838
Oh, really?

33:54.878 --> 33:56.946
The last time I checked,
the cure for devastation

33:57.013 --> 33:59.115
wasn't a fistful of NoDoz
and a pot of coffee.

33:59.182 --> 34:00.349
We have
to keep him awake.

34:01.466 --> 34:03.367
If he falls asleep,
Carson Churchill takes over.

34:04.836 --> 34:06.137
It's the only way
I can think of

34:06.153 --> 34:07.383
to keep Michael <i>Michael.</i>

34:08.259 --> 34:09.862
Do me a favor.
Fill this up with water.

34:09.962 --> 34:12.563
I gotta get his laundry
out of the dryer.

34:16.902 --> 34:19.704
We have a name
for people like you:

34:19.771 --> 34:22.907
"success blockers."

34:22.975 --> 34:24.708
Sometimes they're
our friends.

34:24.775 --> 34:26.744
More often than not,
they're family.

34:26.812 --> 34:30.915
You think you want Michael
to live up to his potential,

34:30.983 --> 34:34.085
but the truth is
you prefer him this way:

34:34.152 --> 34:38.723
broken, sleeping on
your couch, dependent.

34:38.790 --> 34:39.956
It's a shame.

34:40.025 --> 34:42.493
He and I were making
so much progress.

34:42.561 --> 34:43.860
Progress, right.

34:43.929 --> 34:45.730
Using him to bump people
with heart problems

34:45.797 --> 34:47.465
off a transplant list.

34:47.532 --> 34:49.000
That was about helping him.

34:49.067 --> 34:50.868
I saved your brother's life

34:50.936 --> 34:54.672
Without me,
he's a bent penny

34:54.739 --> 34:56.639
someone finds on
the railroad tracks.

34:56.708 --> 34:59.176
Don't you think I deserve
something for that?

34:59.244 --> 35:00.678
You want to know what I think?

35:00.746 --> 35:02.246
I think what you're doing's
reprehensible.

35:02.314 --> 35:04.682
Look, I'm sorry
that your wife is sick,

35:04.750 --> 35:07.184
but the people who are on
that list ahead of her

35:07.252 --> 35:08.986
are there for a reason.

35:09.054 --> 35:11.789
You make it sound like
I murdered them.

35:11.857 --> 35:12.523
Didn't you?

35:12.591 --> 35:14.158
I put them in situations

35:14.226 --> 35:16.093
where they were forced
to make decisions.

35:16.161 --> 35:17.862
Jason Bumgarner decided

35:17.929 --> 35:20.731
he'd rather have revenge
than a new heart.

35:20.799 --> 35:23.167
Ken Corrigan decided he'd rather
have a drink.

35:23.235 --> 35:26.937
Everything those men did,
they did of their own volition.

35:27.005 --> 35:28.706
Yeah, you just put them
on cliffs,

35:28.757 --> 35:30.174
it's not like you pushed.

35:30.242 --> 35:32.843
You need to let him
go to sleep, Mrs. DuBois.

35:32.911 --> 35:34.311
What?

35:34.379 --> 35:36.180
You heard me.

35:36.248 --> 35:38.849
It's going to happen eventually,
it might as well be tonight.

35:38.917 --> 35:40.718
There are still a few
names on that list

35:40.786 --> 35:42.386
he and I need to attend to.

35:42.454 --> 35:44.021
You are insane.

35:44.089 --> 35:47.191
Ultimately, it won't be
up to you.

35:47.259 --> 35:49.260
You can't keep him awake
forever.

35:49.327 --> 35:52.863
And when he nods off,
I'll be back at the wheel.

35:52.931 --> 35:54.999
Or I could always
accelerate things,

35:55.067 --> 35:56.867
stop putting people on cliffs,
as you put it,

35:56.935 --> 35:59.537
start strangling them
with my own bare hands.

35:59.604 --> 36:03.307
My bare hands will be
Michael's bare hands, of course.

36:03.375 --> 36:05.376
You go to Hell.

36:24.229 --> 36:25.813
Smoke bothering you?

36:25.897 --> 36:27.364
I can move if you want.

36:27.432 --> 36:29.700
Yeah, I'd like
you to move.

36:29.768 --> 36:32.303
Closer.

36:32.370 --> 36:34.155
Right.

36:34.239 --> 36:36.507
Fellow traveler, huh?

36:36.575 --> 36:37.508
You want one?

36:37.576 --> 36:39.110
Do I want one?
Absolutely.

36:39.161 --> 36:40.611
Can I have one?
Absolutely not.

36:40.679 --> 36:42.980
I quit cold turkey
six months ago.

36:43.048 --> 36:44.331
Wow.
Good for you.

36:44.416 --> 36:46.016
Well, I ruined the
heart God gave me,

36:46.084 --> 36:47.351
now I'm waiting
for another one.

36:47.419 --> 36:49.787
and the doctors tell me
I won't get it

36:49.838 --> 36:51.839
if I have one of those.

36:51.923 --> 36:53.924
Well, have they offered you
a new heart yet?

36:55.260 --> 36:58.179
So one smoke,
for old times' sake.

36:58.263 --> 36:59.630
How are they gonna know?

36:59.681 --> 37:03.267
Nah, they say the call
could come in any day.

37:05.270 --> 37:07.037
Well, that seems
kind of vague.

37:07.105 --> 37:10.541
Could be tomorrow, could be
six months from now.

37:10.609 --> 37:12.309
I won't tell if you won't.

37:19.284 --> 37:21.068
I guess one won't hurt.

37:22.871 --> 37:24.889
You got a light?
Indeed I do.

37:45.710 --> 37:47.711
It hasn't happened yet.

37:49.147 --> 37:51.182
You wanted to see me?

37:51.249 --> 37:53.517
Shut the door, would you?

37:59.824 --> 38:02.459
So, Bridgette DuBois did
see something the other day.

38:02.527 --> 38:05.062
You're welcome.

38:05.113 --> 38:08.065
So? Tell me, tell me, tell me.

38:08.116 --> 38:09.366
Well, do you
remember

38:09.434 --> 38:11.569
when I interviewed you
about managing my campaign?

38:11.636 --> 38:13.237
You told me I should hire you

38:13.305 --> 38:14.772
because you had
worked with Charlie Dalton,

38:14.839 --> 38:16.874
managed his first run
for city council?

38:16.942 --> 38:18.709
Sure. Okay.

38:18.777 --> 38:21.212
And as I'm sure you'll recall,

38:21.279 --> 38:24.215
Charlie's district was largely
comprised of families of means.

38:24.282 --> 38:27.218
His kind of people,
I think he called them.

38:27.285 --> 38:29.353
But there was also
a less moneyed

38:29.421 --> 38:31.822
part of his district that
absolutely despised him.

38:31.890 --> 38:33.590
Okay... yes... yeah.

38:33.642 --> 38:35.059
Uh, what did Charlie do?

38:35.126 --> 38:37.261
It's not what Charlie did,
Justine, it's what you did.

38:38.563 --> 38:39.730
I beg your pardon?

38:39.798 --> 38:42.533
You were paying an
election worker named Eugene

38:42.601 --> 38:45.803
to destroy the ballots at his
polling place on election day.

38:45.870 --> 38:48.672
Took me a few days,
but with Bridgette's help

38:48.740 --> 38:51.375
I was able to identify
that worker as Eugene Krebs.

38:51.443 --> 38:53.043
He manned the polling place

38:53.111 --> 38:55.679
in the poorest part of
Charlie's district that year.

38:56.715 --> 38:59.617
This is... this is crazy.

38:59.684 --> 39:02.519
We're talking about something
some kid saw in her head.

39:02.587 --> 39:04.255
You can't prove it.

39:04.322 --> 39:05.956
But I can try.

39:06.024 --> 39:08.492
How about if I launch
an official investigation,

39:08.560 --> 39:10.594
see what Eugene Krebs has
to say on the matter?

39:10.662 --> 39:13.697
I think that
both you and I know

39:13.765 --> 39:16.033
that I'm not a big fan of
mud-slinging, dirty politics,

39:16.101 --> 39:17.735
negative anything.

39:17.802 --> 39:19.970
So why don't you
pack your things and go?

39:22.907 --> 39:24.808
Justine...

39:24.876 --> 39:27.278
there is one more phone call
I'd like you to make.

39:27.345 --> 39:28.612
Call Charlie Dalton.

39:28.680 --> 39:30.247
Tell him what
we discussed here this morning.

39:30.315 --> 39:31.482
And make it clear to him

39:31.549 --> 39:33.317
that if he continues
to campaign negatively,

39:33.385 --> 39:36.120
I will start that investigation.

39:46.931 --> 39:49.300
Carson?

39:49.367 --> 39:51.502
Hobie. Do you mind if
I call you "Hobie"?

39:51.569 --> 39:53.804
I mean, my brother
told me you hate that,

39:53.872 --> 39:56.807
but you seem more like a
Hobie than a Carson to me.

39:56.875 --> 39:59.777
This is just sad.

39:59.844 --> 40:01.979
Why are you so
bound and determined

40:02.030 --> 40:04.898
to stand in the way
of your brother's success?

40:04.983 --> 40:07.818
Perhaps you'd rather
just visit him in jail.

40:07.886 --> 40:09.820
You know what's funny?

40:09.888 --> 40:13.357
My brother, even after all this,

40:13.425 --> 40:15.759
he likes you.

40:15.827 --> 40:17.378
He thinks that you helped him.

40:17.462 --> 40:19.163
I mean,
he hates what you're doing.

40:19.230 --> 40:20.798
He hates that you lied to him,

40:20.865 --> 40:22.466
but he doesn't think
you're a monster.

40:24.636 --> 40:26.870
Even after I told him
what you said last night,

40:26.938 --> 40:29.473
about being willing to commit
murder to get what you wanted,

40:29.541 --> 40:31.759
being willing to send him
to prison forever,

40:31.843 --> 40:33.610
he didn't believe it.

40:33.678 --> 40:36.613
He thinks
you're better than that.

40:36.681 --> 40:38.649
Well, he's wrong.

40:38.716 --> 40:39.850
No, I know.

40:41.219 --> 40:43.020
You know what? You can
put those cigarettes away.

40:43.071 --> 40:45.122
You're not going to trick anyone
into smoking today.

40:45.190 --> 40:47.591
What's this?

40:47.659 --> 40:49.660
Those are my brother's
reenlistment papers.

40:49.727 --> 40:51.195
Yeah.

40:51.262 --> 40:53.113
We stopped by the recruiting
office this morning,

40:53.198 --> 40:54.965
before he fell asleep.

40:55.033 --> 40:57.034
If you don't leave
my brother alone,

40:57.085 --> 41:00.070
and if you don't end this
right here, right now,

41:00.138 --> 41:01.839
I'll file those papers.

41:01.906 --> 41:03.640
He'll do another tour of duty.

41:03.708 --> 41:06.126
They'll deploy him,
and who knows where,

41:06.211 --> 41:07.778
but it's not going
to be in Phoenix,

41:07.846 --> 41:09.246
It's not going
to be anywhere near

41:09.314 --> 41:12.149
any of those people who are
ahead of your wife on that list.

41:12.217 --> 41:14.852
Smart play.

41:17.772 --> 41:20.491
Well, I'll tell Michael
that you said so.

41:20.558 --> 41:21.859
It was his idea.

41:23.595 --> 41:25.696
Boy's got promise.

41:25.764 --> 41:28.332
He's just a late bloomer.

41:32.120 --> 41:33.603
Do me a favor.

41:33.655 --> 41:35.406
Tell him there's nothing
I did for him

41:35.473 --> 41:37.941
that he can't keep doing
for himself.

41:38.009 --> 41:40.411
Tell him...

41:40.478 --> 41:43.347
that he can
still be a success.

41:43.415 --> 41:46.350
Tell him he can still be
the best Michael he can be.

41:46.418 --> 41:49.153
Well, I think
he knows that already,

41:49.220 --> 41:52.389
but I'll pass
that message along.

42:02.767 --> 42:05.152
Hey, Carson. Michael.

42:05.236 --> 42:07.004
Hey, hey.
You can't sleep here.

42:09.407 --> 42:12.159
Wow. We're here.

42:12.243 --> 42:13.944
So what's the verdict?

42:14.012 --> 42:15.412
Am I back in the Army?

42:15.480 --> 42:17.664
Ah, no, not today.

42:17.749 --> 42:19.850
No, you know what?
You read him exactly right.

42:19.918 --> 42:21.218
Much better than I did.

42:21.286 --> 42:23.587
See, that's why you're
such a great salesman.

42:23.655 --> 42:25.706
Pardon me.

42:25.790 --> 42:28.959
Would you mind scooting
over a bit, so I can sit?

42:29.010 --> 42:30.711
You know what?
We were just leaving.

42:30.795 --> 42:32.463
I have to get
back to work.

42:32.530 --> 42:34.348
It's all yours.
