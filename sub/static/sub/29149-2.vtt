10:00.856 --> 10:03.882
LAWRENCE YEE: Ah, dude. Anytime.

10:03.883 --> 10:04.973
Hey, Lawrence.

10:04.974 --> 10:07.550
I heard you were drying
out in a <i> Schloss,</i>

10:07.551 --> 10:09.684
doing shitty yoga with <i> hausfrau?</i>

10:09.685 --> 10:11.320
- KENDALL: Right. right.
- (ROMAN LAUGHS)

10:11.321 --> 10:12.512
Nope.

10:12.513 --> 10:15.724
He is back. He is back,
like a pedo on parole.

10:15.725 --> 10:17.759
KENDALL: Yeah, man, we're
just here for a catch-up.

10:17.760 --> 10:20.963
You know? Super casual, feet
on the table, whatever the fuck.

10:20.964 --> 10:22.497
Just, uh, just help you out.

10:22.498 --> 10:23.999
LAWRENCE: O... Obviously,
I'm always pleased

10:24.000 --> 10:25.034
to get your insights,

10:25.035 --> 10:27.135
but, like, who am I talking to?

10:27.938 --> 10:29.104
Co...

10:29.105 --> 10:30.105
COOs.

10:30.106 --> 10:31.273
Who's in charge here?

10:31.274 --> 10:34.343
My brother and I have
a joint responsibility.

10:34.344 --> 10:35.669
You know, we're sharing duties,

10:35.670 --> 10:38.896
but we're on the same page
operationally. Right, Rome?

10:38.897 --> 10:41.155
I don't know what the
fuck he's talking about.

10:41.156 --> 10:42.384
KENDALL: There's just, uh,

10:42.385 --> 10:45.821
a lot of, uh, crackle
in the air right now.

10:45.822 --> 10:48.156
External pressures
with the proxy battle,

10:48.157 --> 10:49.290
- that whole...
- LAWRENCE: Yeah.

10:49.291 --> 10:51.960
So you're defusing the bomb you planted.

10:51.961 --> 10:53.328
(ROMAN LAUGHS)

10:53.329 --> 10:57.231
Yes, precisely. See,
he gets it. He sees.

10:57.232 --> 11:00.335
We're just here for a
routine health check.

11:00.336 --> 11:01.436
That's all this is.

11:01.437 --> 11:02.595
Where's this coming from?

11:02.596 --> 11:04.354
- It's coming from us.
- ROMAN: It's coming from Dad.

11:04.355 --> 11:05.912
No. What, why are we
dancing around this?

11:05.913 --> 11:07.713
It's coming from Dad.
Dad's worried about you.

11:08.045 --> 11:09.203
Okay.

11:09.204 --> 11:10.761
ROMAN: I mean, come
on, you know how he is.

11:10.762 --> 11:12.917
He doesn't get it. He still has
a plant out in the Philippines

11:12.918 --> 11:14.850
manufacturing Xerox machines.

11:14.851 --> 11:16.684
But he's fucking shrewd.

11:16.685 --> 11:18.886
And, right now...

11:18.887 --> 11:21.254
right now, his giant cyclops eye

11:21.255 --> 11:23.724
is looking in this direction,
and he's feeling like

11:23.725 --> 11:26.393
maybe he bought a
giant pile of bullshit.

11:26.394 --> 11:27.828
So now here I am

11:27.829 --> 11:30.464
to enquire in the
politest terms possible

11:30.465 --> 11:32.500
what the fuck is going on.

11:32.501 --> 11:34.368
Dad thinks maybe you fucked him.

11:34.369 --> 11:37.605
Our numbers were solid
when you bought us,

11:37.606 --> 11:38.839
and they're solid now.

11:38.840 --> 11:40.474
ROMAN: Dude, really,
don't take it personally.

11:40.475 --> 11:41.822
Dad thinks everyone's fucking him.

11:41.823 --> 11:43.377
KENDALL: I know you're on the level.

11:43.378 --> 11:44.769
Help me make him see that.

11:44.770 --> 11:45.794
What do you need?

11:45.795 --> 11:48.488
I need metrics, I need KPIs,

11:48.489 --> 11:50.783
and, uh, I need an office.

11:50.784 --> 11:53.252
ROMAN: Me too, I need an office as well.

11:53.253 --> 11:55.287
Separate from his. Nicer.

11:55.288 --> 11:58.124
It's on, me versus the Peach.

11:58.125 --> 11:59.392
Okay, I'm gonna s...

11:59.393 --> 12:01.394
I'm gonna swing the old meat mallet.

12:01.395 --> 12:03.763
I'm gonna sit on her
right out of the box.

12:03.764 --> 12:05.164
Okay, so I could be calling

12:05.165 --> 12:06.966
for a little bit of
the old punch-bagging,

12:06.967 --> 12:08.001
okay, buddy?

12:08.002 --> 12:10.503
- GREG: Uh-huh.
- Ready to play the bag?

12:10.504 --> 12:12.671
- Y... Yeah, yeah. Give it to me.
- Okay.

12:14.174 --> 12:15.174
What?

12:16.410 --> 12:17.576
What is it, Greg?

12:18.846 --> 12:21.514
Being in at ATN, you
know, it's kinda like

12:21.515 --> 12:23.683
the one thing I didn't wanna do.

12:23.684 --> 12:25.084
Oh, okay. So, what...

12:25.085 --> 12:26.652
Should I have left you at Parks to sink?

12:26.653 --> 12:27.719
I mean, it's...

12:27.720 --> 12:29.555
it's ATN, man. It's the fuckin' news.

12:29.556 --> 12:31.390
- I know.
- It's Logan's G-spot.

12:31.391 --> 12:33.059
I can finger-bang him all night long.

12:33.060 --> 12:35.394
I'm a direct direct report. What?

12:35.395 --> 12:36.694
Sure, just...

12:38.498 --> 12:39.564
ATN?

12:40.233 --> 12:42.768
It's... It's like...

12:42.769 --> 12:45.604
- kind of against my principles.
- Your principles?

12:45.605 --> 12:48.207
Greg, don't be an asshole.
You don't have principles.

12:48.208 --> 12:50.909
Dude, ATN is a very toxic
element in the culture.

12:50.910 --> 12:54.447
Oh, seriously? Okay, name me
one principle that you have.

12:54.448 --> 12:56.482
I don't know, like, I'm against racism.

12:56.483 --> 13:00.209
Bullshit. I'm against racism.
Everybody's against racism.

13:00.210 --> 13:01.219
What else?

13:01.220 --> 13:03.254
- Like, don't lie.
- Fuck off.

13:03.255 --> 13:04.790
- Like, if you're the news, you...
- Fuck off!

13:04.791 --> 13:06.483
- That's your principle?
- Yeah, dude.

13:06.484 --> 13:09.595
Greg, this is not fucking
Charles Dickens world, okay?

13:09.596 --> 13:12.363
You don't go around
talking about principles.

13:12.364 --> 13:13.999
We're all trying to do the right thing,

13:14.000 --> 13:15.100
of course we are.

13:15.101 --> 13:16.901
But come on, man!

13:18.337 --> 13:19.737
Man the fuck up!

13:20.873 --> 13:23.508
(MUTTERING) Okay, I am manned, man.

13:23.509 --> 13:24.843
Here comes Cyd.

13:24.844 --> 13:26.612
Hey, Cyd! The Peach!

13:26.613 --> 13:28.046
The legend!

13:28.047 --> 13:29.305
Oh, Tom!

13:29.306 --> 13:30.315
- Tom!
- Hey!

13:30.316 --> 13:31.950
It's great to have you aboard.

13:31.951 --> 13:33.418
I know that this is gonna be

13:33.419 --> 13:35.853
a really productive collaboration.

13:35.854 --> 13:37.221
I just hope

13:37.222 --> 13:39.857
that there's no... weirdness

13:39.858 --> 13:42.093
with our fuzzy boundaries, right?

13:42.094 --> 13:44.528
Are you kidding? If you...
If you wanna go fast,

13:44.529 --> 13:47.865
go alone. If you wanna
go far, go together.

13:47.866 --> 13:49.275
- Right?
- Exactly.

13:49.276 --> 13:50.315
Yeah.

13:50.316 --> 13:51.941
- Come meet the team.
- Amazing!

13:51.942 --> 13:53.366
You wanna lead in there?

13:53.367 --> 13:55.292
Oh, fuck no.

13:55.293 --> 13:57.185
- You lead, Tommy.
- Okay.

13:57.186 --> 13:59.011
You mind if I big-ball the first one?

13:59.012 --> 14:01.278
Do it! Your funeral, buddy.

14:01.279 --> 14:03.114
- (APPLAUSE)
- SPEAKER: <i> Thank you, thank you.</i>

14:03.115 --> 14:05.650
So did he actually even see my draft?

14:05.651 --> 14:06.708
Uh... no.

14:06.709 --> 14:08.800
In the end, I just thought
the draft Kelly and I did

14:08.801 --> 14:11.160
had more, uh, goodness.

14:11.161 --> 14:12.218
As in... ?

14:12.219 --> 14:13.810
As in it had the quality of being good

14:13.811 --> 14:15.425
rather than the
attributes of being shitty.

14:15.426 --> 14:18.395
NATE: Um, just also re
Kelly, little sidebar.

14:18.396 --> 14:20.096
Can you not tell people about us?

14:20.097 --> 14:21.365
Oh, but there is no us.

14:21.366 --> 14:23.400
Right. but there was an
us, and the problem is,

14:23.401 --> 14:24.668
my wife doesn't know about it.

14:24.669 --> 14:26.870
Oh, but my husband
absolutely does know about it,

14:26.871 --> 14:29.306
so I guess that's,
what, it's your problem?

14:29.307 --> 14:30.607
We had the affair.

14:30.608 --> 14:32.008
We didn't have the conversation

14:32.009 --> 14:33.644
about telling people we had the affair.

14:33.645 --> 14:35.379
I'm sorry, Nate, did you
want a conference call

14:35.380 --> 14:37.680
to discuss how to tell
your wife we fucked?

14:39.584 --> 14:41.184
- (APPLAUSE)
- GIL EAVIS: Thank you, everyone.

14:41.185 --> 14:43.452
Great event. Great event.

14:43.453 --> 14:46.121
Thank you, everyone, so much.

14:46.122 --> 14:47.290
And the polling!

14:47.291 --> 14:49.958
My God! I mean, nobody's
getting carried away,

14:49.959 --> 14:51.727
just one set of numbers,

14:51.728 --> 14:54.863
one pretty big set of
numbers. (CHUCKLES) Right?

14:54.864 --> 14:59.468
Right, so thank you. And
testament to your faith.

14:59.469 --> 15:00.836
Thank you. Please,

15:00.837 --> 15:03.105
indulge yourselves in some, uh,

15:03.106 --> 15:05.374
gluten and melted cheese. Why not?

15:05.375 --> 15:07.009
- (LAUGHTER)
- Thank you, thank you.

15:07.010 --> 15:08.744
- (APPLAUSE)
- GIL: Mm.

15:08.745 --> 15:10.346
Hey, uh, how was the call?

15:10.347 --> 15:13.281
Great. They're eating
out of my ass crack.

15:13.282 --> 15:16.418
Offered me use of the
fucking jet on the weekend.

15:16.419 --> 15:18.320
Uh, yeah, I mean, the legals are wonky

15:18.321 --> 15:21.089
and the optics are shitty,
but (CHUCKLES) go ahead.

15:22.759 --> 15:23.926
Look.

15:23.927 --> 15:26.428
You don't look a gift
Boeing in the teeth.

15:26.429 --> 15:27.996
Right? Right?

15:27.997 --> 15:29.597
- No.
- I'll be so much fresher.

15:31.067 --> 15:33.401
Excuse us for a second. I just wanna...

15:33.402 --> 15:34.970
Ma'am, listen.

15:34.971 --> 15:36.839
Long road to travel and all of that,

15:36.840 --> 15:39.674
but the compass points
to Pennsylvania Avenue.

15:39.675 --> 15:41.809
I have to start thinking
about appointments.

15:43.546 --> 15:45.279
I'm thinking about Chief of Staff.

15:46.249 --> 15:48.950
Uh... Oh, wow.

15:48.951 --> 15:50.218
- Yeah.
- (CHUCKLES)

15:50.219 --> 15:53.621
I mean, can you imagine the look of fear

15:53.622 --> 15:56.224
in their eyes when they
see you coming at them?

15:56.225 --> 15:58.659
Those corpulent old white fucks.

15:58.660 --> 16:00.161
- (CHUCKLES)
- Huh?

16:00.162 --> 16:01.795
How's that for a carrot?

16:02.197 --> 16:03.329
Hm?

16:04.933 --> 16:07.268
So that's where we shape the debate.

16:07.269 --> 16:09.670
Ooh, cool shit.

16:09.671 --> 16:12.273
And I love the way the
debate keeps on getting shaped

16:12.274 --> 16:14.375
like a burning cross. (LAUGHS)

16:14.376 --> 16:16.277
You don't share our news values.

16:16.278 --> 16:17.478
Oh, I'm kidding.

16:17.479 --> 16:19.546
I'm kidding. I get it.
I'm from the Midwest.

16:19.547 --> 16:22.183
You know, my mom's friend,
Deb, weighs, like, 300 pounds,

16:22.184 --> 16:24.351
and she's pissed as fuck
about practically everything,

16:24.352 --> 16:26.353
so, you know, trust me,

16:26.354 --> 16:27.921
I'm down. I get it.

16:27.922 --> 16:31.057
Besides, what Logan
wants, Logan gets, right?

16:31.058 --> 16:33.661
Logan doesn't set our news agenda.

16:33.662 --> 16:36.497
Oh. (LAUGHS) No, of course he doesn't.

16:36.498 --> 16:38.131
I know, it's so weird, huh?

16:38.132 --> 16:40.167
He happens to own a news company

16:40.168 --> 16:42.569
and they say exactly what he thinks.

16:42.570 --> 16:44.305
If Logan had to tell me

16:44.306 --> 16:46.072
or any of my news editors

16:46.073 --> 16:48.342
what to run or what the angle was,

16:48.343 --> 16:51.278
we would be fucked.
That is not how it works.

16:51.279 --> 16:52.713
This isn't mind control.

16:52.714 --> 16:55.248
We hire people who want to work here.

16:55.249 --> 16:56.683
and we serve a demographic

16:56.684 --> 16:59.885
of highly, highly intelligent viewers,

16:59.886 --> 17:01.954
who are really tired

17:01.955 --> 17:04.056
of being patronized elsewhere

17:04.057 --> 17:06.826
by latte-sipping douchebags

17:06.827 --> 17:08.560
with hundred-dollar haircuts.

17:10.464 --> 17:12.565
You've got the cool job title,

17:12.566 --> 17:13.833
you've got freedom of movement.

17:13.834 --> 17:17.036
Why don't you take a
look somewhere more comfy?

17:17.037 --> 17:18.069
Entertainment?

17:18.070 --> 17:19.771
'Cause this is where the action is.

17:19.772 --> 17:21.840
This is the profit center.

17:21.842 --> 17:25.611
The median age of our audience is 68.

17:25.612 --> 17:29.514
The ads are all adult
diapers and shit pills.

17:29.515 --> 17:31.450
Our lead in the news demo has halved.

17:31.451 --> 17:33.052
You know, maybe I can

17:33.053 --> 17:35.520
lend a hand to take a
look at some of that.

17:35.521 --> 17:36.922
You know,

17:36.923 --> 17:39.725
he sends me one of you every four years.

17:39.726 --> 17:42.328
- That train is never late.
- Interesting.

17:42.329 --> 17:45.030
And tell me, these others that he sends,

17:45.031 --> 17:46.865
were they his son-in-law too?

17:47.633 --> 17:49.634
I'm curious.

17:49.635 --> 17:53.105
Efficiencies, Cyd! I'm
here to trim the flab.

17:53.106 --> 17:55.007
Have you told Logan this?

17:55.008 --> 17:57.042
I spy savings, Cyd.

17:57.043 --> 17:58.911
Oh, good, Tom.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.212
That's very good.

18:00.213 --> 18:03.013
Because I run a pretty tight ship.

18:03.649 --> 18:04.649
So...

18:05.651 --> 18:06.785
good luck to you.

18:06.786 --> 18:10.154
I'm sure you've got
him very, very excited.

18:10.155 --> 18:11.955
I hope you can deliver.

18:15.127 --> 18:16.495
Well... (CLEARS THROAT)

18:16.496 --> 18:17.996
Thank you very much.

18:17.997 --> 18:19.931
And, uh, fuck you.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.133
And, uh, I'll catch up with you later.

28:22.225 --> 28:23.759
CONNOR: "I wanna stay on the ranch.

28:23.760 --> 28:25.161
Maybe I'll get me a new girlfriend."

28:25.162 --> 28:26.828
- (LAUGHTER)
- CONNOR: I'm kidding.

28:26.829 --> 28:27.878
(WILLA CHUCKLES)

28:27.879 --> 28:29.498
WILLA: No, I mean, it's true.

28:29.499 --> 28:32.168
It was pretty hard to wheedle
the old man out of the dessert.

28:32.169 --> 28:33.202
(LAUGHTER)

28:33.203 --> 28:35.648
But, um, we're here now

28:35.649 --> 28:38.807
in our, um, not-so-humble home...

28:38.808 --> 28:40.342
hotel. Um.

28:40.343 --> 28:42.970
But, uh, friends, family, please,

28:42.971 --> 28:44.872
you know, feel free to drop in anytime,

28:44.873 --> 28:47.041
and, um, don't worry about all this,

28:47.042 --> 28:50.244
'cause it's on our tab. (LAUGHS) So...

28:50.245 --> 28:51.577
Okay. Great.

28:52.380 --> 28:53.814
Cheers! (CHUCKLES)

28:53.815 --> 28:55.348
Okay. (CHUCKLES)

28:56.818 --> 28:58.518
Hey, Con, thank you so much

28:58.519 --> 29:00.587
for taking care of the
sliders and all this shit.

29:00.588 --> 29:02.656
Yeah, and the champagne.
It's very big of you.

29:02.657 --> 29:04.791
And I love what you haven't
done with the place as well.

29:04.792 --> 29:06.760
Yeah, well, you know we
got a really good deal.

29:06.761 --> 29:08.295
And rehearsals are
right around the corner.

29:08.296 --> 29:09.796
Plus, I needed a place in the city

29:09.797 --> 29:11.298
'cause I'm gonna start ramping up soon.

29:11.299 --> 29:13.733
So I needed campaign headquarters.

29:13.734 --> 29:14.969
(COUGHING) Wait.

29:14.970 --> 29:16.971
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

29:16.972 --> 29:19.306
- Are you still doing that?
- Very funny. Yes.

29:19.307 --> 29:20.807
I'm still applying for the job

29:20.808 --> 29:22.443
of President of the United States.

29:22.444 --> 29:23.877
WILLA: Oh, good for you.

29:23.878 --> 29:25.111
Yeah. Do you...

29:25.112 --> 29:26.912
Do you think that that's
like a natural progression

29:26.913 --> 29:28.814
from "never done nothing, never,"

29:28.815 --> 29:30.483
to "most important job in the world?"

29:30.484 --> 29:31.884
- CONNOR: Well...
- Like, could you maybe

29:31.885 --> 29:34.187
get a little experience at,
like at a CVS, something, first?

29:34.188 --> 29:36.755
Yeah, yeah, or just, like,
nickel hand jobs under a bridge.

29:36.756 --> 29:38.636
- Start small.
- You guys have big plans for me.

29:39.226 --> 29:41.027
Place is a time machine.

29:41.028 --> 29:44.163
It's like 45 minutes every
time they need file tape,

29:44.164 --> 29:46.099
all the way to some warehouse in Queens.

29:46.100 --> 29:47.133
Okay, so?

29:47.134 --> 29:48.601
So, I don't know. I mean...

29:48.602 --> 29:50.503
How come it isn't digitized?

29:50.504 --> 29:53.172
The whole of ATN, it's
totally analog, Tom.

29:53.173 --> 29:55.008
So I could fire people?

29:55.009 --> 29:57.643
Correct? If we did
this? If we digitized?

29:57.644 --> 30:00.145
I... (SIGHS) I mean,
you'd be removing, like,

30:00.146 --> 30:02.514
two links from the production
chain of every show.

30:02.515 --> 30:03.781
- But would it be...
- Okay, okay, okay.

30:03.782 --> 30:06.051
But... but in terms of skulls,

30:06.052 --> 30:08.520
how many skulls, do you think?

30:08.521 --> 30:10.155
- That we can lose?
- Yeah.

30:10.156 --> 30:12.924
I dunno. I... I guess, like, 30 or 50?

30:12.925 --> 30:14.425
Fifty skulls?

30:17.463 --> 30:18.763
I'm slavering, pig man!

30:18.764 --> 30:20.456
Fifty skulls is a lot of skulls!

30:20.457 --> 30:21.533
Yeah.

30:21.534 --> 30:24.202
I know, it's goo... It's... tons.

30:24.203 --> 30:26.203
Oh, look at this fuckin' prick.

30:27.640 --> 30:29.574
Yikes, I almost feel sorry for him.

30:29.575 --> 30:30.842
SHIV: Oh yeah? Why?

30:30.843 --> 30:32.644
ROMAN: Just emptied the
contents of his scrotum

30:32.645 --> 30:33.645
at Dad's feet.

30:34.713 --> 30:35.914
We're gutting Vaulter.

30:35.915 --> 30:37.481
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

30:37.482 --> 30:39.316
Is that a good idea?

30:39.317 --> 30:40.852
Fucking great idea.

30:40.853 --> 30:43.387
It's Kendall's baby, and
now we're gonna burn it.

30:43.388 --> 30:44.689
(SNICKERS)

30:44.690 --> 30:47.491
Hey, um... So, we we're thinking, uh...

30:47.492 --> 30:49.126
me and, uh, Tabitha and I,

30:49.127 --> 30:52.663
uh, that we'd like to have
you and Tom over for dinner.

30:53.432 --> 30:55.299
Uh... sorry, what? Do you...

30:55.300 --> 30:57.401
Roman Roy, did you just
invite us to dinner?

30:57.402 --> 30:58.770
Oh, fuck you. All right, shut up.

30:58.771 --> 31:00.972
Yes, I did. Metro poser bullshit.

31:00.973 --> 31:02.373
(HIGH VOICE) Napkins and chitchat.

31:02.374 --> 31:04.441
Ooh, race relations. Kale.

31:19.626 --> 31:20.716
Hey.

31:20.717 --> 31:21.809
Hey.

31:21.810 --> 31:23.401
Do you reckon if I called room service

31:23.402 --> 31:25.322
and asked them to poke
me in the eye, they would?

31:26.731 --> 31:28.164
It's pretty unbearable in there.

31:30.602 --> 31:31.667
Can I get a drag?

31:32.404 --> 31:33.404
Yeah.

31:36.308 --> 31:38.274
I hear Dad's got Vaulter in a crosshair.

31:41.178 --> 31:42.178
Roman?

31:42.916 --> 31:44.106
(SCOFFS)

31:44.107 --> 31:45.982
He shouldn't be talking
to you about that.

31:45.983 --> 31:48.518
Just seems like a bad move to me.

31:48.519 --> 31:50.885
I'm just saying, I always liked it.

31:52.789 --> 31:54.055
Yeah, well.

31:55.626 --> 31:56.825
Dad's right.

31:58.429 --> 31:59.828
Are you with him on this?

32:02.266 --> 32:04.133
He sees everything, Shiv.

32:05.769 --> 32:07.537
You have a hard time
finding a happy medium

32:07.538 --> 32:10.573
between worshipping him
and wanting to kill him.

32:10.574 --> 32:11.640
Huh?

32:12.809 --> 32:14.777
(SHIV LAUGHS)

32:14.778 --> 32:15.810
(GLASSES CLINK)

32:15.811 --> 32:17.446
- The Vaulter thing.
- TABITHA: Mm.

32:17.447 --> 32:18.813
Gutting it.

32:18.814 --> 32:20.549
What if it's the wrong thing?

32:20.550 --> 32:22.050
I thought your dad agreed with you?

32:22.051 --> 32:24.853
Uh, yeah, he did. And
now they're doing it.

32:24.854 --> 32:27.155
They're actually doing
the thing that I said.

32:27.890 --> 32:29.158
TABITHA: Fuck.

32:29.159 --> 32:31.960
Think maybe you just did your job.

32:31.961 --> 32:33.327
Shall we get some more champagne?

32:33.829 --> 32:35.531
I mean...

32:35.532 --> 32:38.366
It could be right. It might
not be, but it could be.

32:39.802 --> 32:40.934
Maybe I'm smart.

32:41.904 --> 32:42.936
Sure.

32:43.739 --> 32:44.739
Maybe.

32:46.142 --> 32:47.609
You did a thing.

32:47.610 --> 32:48.742
Mazel tov.

32:49.388 --> 32:50.578
You know, I'm gonna...

32:50.579 --> 32:52.714
I'm gonna schedule
some time with your dad,

32:52.715 --> 32:54.415
and take him out for dinner
and wine him and dine him

32:54.416 --> 32:56.751
and make love to him
with my ideas, you know?

32:56.752 --> 32:58.419
This could be huge, Shiv.

32:58.420 --> 33:00.454
SHIV: Tom, I think...

33:00.455 --> 33:02.056
I think we should talk.

33:03.425 --> 33:04.993
Uh...

33:04.994 --> 33:06.293
You wanna get out of here?

33:08.974 --> 33:09.998
Okay.

33:09.999 --> 33:11.232
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

33:11.233 --> 33:13.068
TOM: Is this about ATN?

33:13.069 --> 33:14.903
Hey, you... you want something?

33:14.904 --> 33:16.504
I'll get you something.

33:16.505 --> 33:18.073
(CORK POPS)

33:18.074 --> 33:19.206
(GLASS CLINKS)

33:21.677 --> 33:23.377
TOM: Ooh, that's a biggie.

33:23.378 --> 33:25.145
Is this about the arrangement?

33:25.146 --> 33:26.780
Look, Tom, it's...

33:26.781 --> 33:28.147
no, it's Waystar.

33:30.018 --> 33:31.251
This is never gonna happen,

33:31.252 --> 33:33.721
and I don't even trust
him, and even if I did,

33:33.722 --> 33:35.654
I'm not even sure that I would want it.

33:37.058 --> 33:38.390
But, uh...

33:41.529 --> 33:42.829
he offered it to me.

33:44.565 --> 33:45.565
To be next.

33:45.967 --> 33:46.999
Dad.

33:49.838 --> 33:50.871
Oh.

33:50.872 --> 33:52.439
- Oh my...
- Mm.

33:52.440 --> 33:54.574
Shiv... when?

33:54.575 --> 33:56.342
SHIV: Uh, the Hamptons.

33:57.311 --> 33:58.744
TOM: The Hamptons?

34:00.214 --> 34:02.382
Oh, my God, Shiv, that's...

34:02.383 --> 34:04.517
- That's like a week ago.
- (SHIV SIGHS)

34:04.518 --> 34:06.185
Congratulations! What the fuck!

34:06.186 --> 34:08.054
SHIV: (LAUGHING) I know!

34:08.054 --> 34:10.357
I mean, I... I... I
don't know what to think.

34:10.358 --> 34:12.292
Holy shit! I mean,

34:12.293 --> 34:14.326
this is... huge!

34:15.329 --> 34:16.420
S...

34:16.420 --> 34:20.447
- So, I mean, do you...
- Want it? No!

34:20.449 --> 34:22.735
And I don't even trust him, so I...

34:22.737 --> 34:24.536
Because I thought that it was something

34:24.538 --> 34:26.273
that we wanted for me...

34:26.274 --> 34:27.440
- We do.
- ... to have it?

34:27.440 --> 34:28.608
- We do!
- That was... I mean,

34:28.609 --> 34:29.876
that was just the plan.

34:29.877 --> 34:31.510
That's st... still the plan.

34:31.511 --> 34:34.013
Me is just a modification of the plan.

34:34.014 --> 34:35.915
TOM: No, sure.

34:35.916 --> 34:37.817
It's q... quite a big modification.

34:37.818 --> 34:39.418
But d... d... so, did...

34:39.418 --> 34:40.652
d... did he...

34:40.654 --> 34:42.855
We... Uh, paint the
picture for me. What'd he...

34:42.856 --> 34:45.257
He asked me, and I said yes.

34:45.259 --> 34:47.126
But only as a play.

34:47.127 --> 34:48.594
TOM: Totally.

34:48.594 --> 34:50.763
So what was the play?

34:50.764 --> 34:53.732
SHIV: Well, he's asked
before, obviously,

34:53.733 --> 34:56.234
and this time was real...

34:57.681 --> 34:58.972
so...

34:58.973 --> 35:02.032
I thought I would be
deleveraging power if I said no.

35:02.033 --> 35:03.599
Exactly. Yes.

35:05.077 --> 35:08.681
Tom, this is 100 percent
not going to happen.

35:08.682 --> 35:11.450
But it's smart to say yes, right?

35:11.451 --> 35:13.118
I am so...

35:13.119 --> 35:14.886
excited for you!

35:14.887 --> 35:16.522
- Thank you.
- For us!

35:16.523 --> 35:18.590
I am.

35:18.591 --> 35:22.860
And you know, it's okay for
you to say that you want it.

35:23.797 --> 35:25.030
I'd support you.

35:25.031 --> 35:26.632
SHIV: Well, look, I mean...

35:26.633 --> 35:29.234
Say I did want it,
w... and I... I don't,

35:29.235 --> 35:30.969
you know, you...

35:30.970 --> 35:33.339
if I was CEO of Waystar, I mean...

35:33.340 --> 35:34.606
(BOTH LAUGH)

35:34.607 --> 35:36.843
I mean, you, honey, are
gonna be something huge.

35:36.844 --> 35:37.935
Yeah.

35:37.936 --> 35:39.260
Sure. Like what?

35:39.261 --> 35:40.551
I... I don't know.

35:40.552 --> 35:41.601
But we'll figure it out.

35:41.602 --> 35:44.049
Yeah, that's for later
on down... down the road.

35:44.050 --> 35:45.930
- Whenever. Just whenever.
- (SHIV EXHALES) Wow.

35:46.776 --> 35:48.475

35:50.356 --> 35:52.290
I mean, it's hilarious, right?

35:52.291 --> 35:53.524
Oh, yes!

35:53.525 --> 35:55.625
- It's fucking funny!
- (SHIV LAUGHS)

- Hey, come here.
- Hey.

36:02.168 --> 36:03.467
- Mm.
- Hey.

36:04.203 --> 36:06.171
Oh. Oh, now?

36:06.172 --> 36:07.739
- Mm. Why not?
- Well, let me just...

36:07.740 --> 36:09.531
Hang on. Let me just
go and brush my teeth.

36:09.532 --> 36:10.574
No.

36:10.575 --> 36:12.108
- No, come here.
- Okay.

36:14.645 --> 36:17.514
I... I hear your brother's
running for president.

36:17.515 --> 36:19.316
Maybe we should get him here.

36:19.317 --> 36:21.618
He seems like the... the serious one.

36:21.619 --> 36:24.120
Right. Lawrence, we have a problem.

36:25.038 --> 36:26.428
- (LAWRENCE CLEARS THROAT)
- Okay?

36:26.429 --> 36:28.162
My dad wants to shut you down.

36:29.694 --> 36:32.696
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah.

36:32.697 --> 36:34.899
But I don't want you
to worry about my dad.

36:34.900 --> 36:36.500
Okay? I can handle my dad.

36:36.501 --> 36:37.701
The fuck you talking about?

36:37.702 --> 36:39.236
I know what's going on here.

36:39.237 --> 36:41.972
Right? It's a... It's a...
It's a Potemkin village.

36:41.973 --> 36:43.607
I mean, the engagement and bounce rate

36:43.608 --> 36:45.675
have been inflated and
fucked around so much

36:45.676 --> 36:47.310
they're impossible to verify.

36:47.311 --> 36:49.279
your share stats, the... the churn,

36:49.280 --> 36:51.581
the SEO traffic KPIs are all bullshit.

36:51.582 --> 36:55.251
I mean, you suckered me
in, and, uh, I bought it.

36:55.252 --> 36:58.121
We had a couple shitty traffic months...

36:58.122 --> 37:00.281
Uh, Facebook changed their algorithm.

37:00.282 --> 37:01.306
Uh-huh.

37:01.307 --> 37:02.683
- We got face-fucked, okay?
- All right.

37:02.684 --> 37:04.008
We're turning the corner now.

37:04.009 --> 37:05.009
Okay.

37:05.763 --> 37:07.096
O... Okay.

37:07.097 --> 37:09.331
What? Yeah, o... okay.
Is... Is that real?

37:10.802 --> 37:12.868
- From Logan?
- Look, I can fix this.

37:13.771 --> 37:15.872
Okay? But no more obfuscation.

37:15.873 --> 37:17.541
No more shitty data.

37:17.542 --> 37:20.576
I need the full, fiber-optic,
clear-channel shit.

37:20.577 --> 37:23.346
CT scan the whole
place, and we move fast.

37:23.347 --> 37:24.713
Okay.

37:24.714 --> 37:26.848
Do you like double-crossing your dad?

37:28.152 --> 37:29.618
Oh, that's your favorite.

37:29.619 --> 37:31.220
Isn't it?

37:31.221 --> 37:35.824
I'm of the opinion he can be
persuaded he's making a mistake.

37:38.562 --> 37:39.727
- Okay?
- Okay.

37:41.098 --> 37:42.332
Oh yeah, w... Uh, one more thing.

37:42.333 --> 37:46.402
I... I... I need everyone
to cool it on unionizing.

37:46.403 --> 37:47.937
Okay, they're not gonna do that.

37:47.938 --> 37:50.173
Half of them are about
to sign union cards.

37:50.174 --> 37:51.239
Let me speak to them.

37:53.243 --> 37:55.410
Everyone here fucking hates you.

37:57.814 --> 37:59.313
I think I can take it.

38:00.216 --> 38:02.184
Hey, everyone. Thanks for...

38:02.185 --> 38:04.587
Thanks for gathering.
This'll just be a minute.

38:04.588 --> 38:06.455
Can you... Can you guys
hear me in the back?

38:06.456 --> 38:08.055
- (INDISTINCT CHATTER)
- Yeah?

38:08.625 --> 38:09.657
Uh...

38:10.727 --> 38:11.727
Vaulter.

38:12.696 --> 38:15.764
Hey, um... Okay.

38:15.765 --> 38:18.033
Look, some of you might
have noticed this already,

38:18.034 --> 38:21.103
but, uh, just so you're
getting it direct from me,

38:21.104 --> 38:24.673
uh, Waystar management has been
taking a look at the business

38:24.674 --> 38:25.908
over the last week.

38:25.909 --> 38:28.209
But I just wanna say
this to you in person...

38:29.382 --> 38:32.575
I believe Vaulter is the
future of this company.

38:32.576 --> 38:33.667
WOMAN: Sure.

38:33.668 --> 38:36.217
I'm Se... I'm fuckin' s... dead serious.

38:36.218 --> 38:38.052
Just... You can't question my belief

38:38.053 --> 38:40.622
in what you've all built here.

38:40.623 --> 38:43.758
You know, in... in... in
what Lawrence has built.

38:43.759 --> 38:45.459
But if we're gonna come through here,

38:45.460 --> 38:47.395
we need to be light on our feet.

38:47.396 --> 38:49.330
That's why I personally think

38:49.331 --> 38:52.433
it would be a mistake
for you to unionize.

38:52.434 --> 38:53.735
(STAFF MUTTERING)

38:53.736 --> 38:54.936
Just... Just hear me out.

38:54.937 --> 38:56.170
Okay, we will get you

38:56.171 --> 38:58.907
a really punchy independent
arbitration panel,

38:58.908 --> 39:00.174
we'll get you a pay bump.

39:00.175 --> 39:02.308
I know a lot of you are
flirting with the guild,

39:02.309 --> 39:04.344
and I'm just asking you to consider

39:04.345 --> 39:05.779
putting that on ice.

39:05.780 --> 39:08.147
And let's try and
figure this out inside.

39:08.917 --> 39:10.483
We keep it in the...

39:10.484 --> 39:14.021
fuckin' super cheesy,
but in the Waystar family.

39:14.022 --> 39:18.158
'Cause we do not want an
adversarial situation here.

39:18.159 --> 39:20.727
Okay, we want communication,

39:20.728 --> 39:22.495
we want engagement.

39:22.496 --> 39:24.097
So let's all pull together

39:24.098 --> 39:25.465
and go back to your desks

39:25.466 --> 39:28.735
and generate me five, ten, 100 ideas

39:28.736 --> 39:30.402
and hit me and my man here up.

39:30.838 --> 39:31.838
Okay?

39:33.174 --> 39:34.207
Thank you.

Yeah, I don't know, Stanley.

39:36.477 --> 39:38.477
I... I just don't know if I could ever

39:38.478 --> 39:40.646
practically make use of this area.

39:40.647 --> 39:43.849
That's just a mezzanine.
You know, it's just a bonus.

39:43.850 --> 39:47.251
you have a... a living room
with under-stair storage.

39:49.790 --> 39:52.825
the thing I need storage for
most urgently of all, Stanley,

39:52.826 --> 39:53.992
is me.

39:57.631 --> 40:00.032

40:39.905 --> 40:42.040
Uh, of this? I think...

40:42.041 --> 40:43.474
it's...

40:43.475 --> 40:47.345
huge. It's, um, it's a very large space.

40:49.281 --> 40:51.015
Uh, I don't know.

40:51.016 --> 40:53.017
Developers overestimated demand,

40:53.018 --> 40:56.420
so I bought all five units
and my guy's gonna flip 'em.

40:56.421 --> 40:58.088
Yeah, 'cause i... it's...

40:58.089 --> 40:59.990

we could stand around and
watch you do a nasal wash.

turning over in my mind is...

do I tell Dad?

43:35.445 --> 43:37.645

I'm just not moving as fast as you.

with your body, man?

nothing wrong with his body,

laughed about it before.

- Yeah.
