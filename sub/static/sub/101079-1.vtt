WEBVTT

01:28.589 --> 01:33.754
- All right.
- So... save the day...

01:33.844 --> 01:37.177
All right. All right.
Here we go. Okay.

01:37.264 --> 01:39.050
Think about the future,
think about...

01:40.851 --> 01:45.015
The power is in... future.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.642
- Tommy, let's go!
- Is inside all of us.

01:47.733 --> 01:50.270
- That's good.
- Let's do this!

01:50.360 --> 01:52.920
- Get rid of the cheap bike!
- Hold on, I'm coming, I'm coming...

01:55.657 --> 01:57.613
- Damn it.
- Come on.

01:59.786 --> 02:00.901
- Tommy.
- I'll take...

02:00.996 --> 02:02.056
Sorry, sorry. Yeah, I know...

02:02.080 --> 02:03.933
- Did you have sex last night?
- No, I didn't...

02:03.957 --> 02:05.727
- I didn't have sex last night.
- I know. But listen, this is important.

02:05.751 --> 02:07.103
This is the biggest meeting of our lives...

02:07.127 --> 02:09.021
- I know, I know, I know. I'm... I'm...
- And you look stressed out,

02:09.045 --> 02:11.399
and I think you really need
to just go to that conference room

02:11.423 --> 02:13.914
and just jerk one off.
It will make you operate.

02:14.009 --> 02:15.590
Like, through the body.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.113
- I'm not doing this.
- You know what I mean?

02:17.137 --> 02:19.378
Oh, today's a nice day.

02:20.390 --> 02:22.472
You know, you guys are my best friends.

02:22.559 --> 02:25.471
I really mean it. Okay, puppies.

02:25.562 --> 02:27.393
Don't be mean.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.563
Just come this way. Come on.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.231
Oh.

02:31.318 --> 02:33.809
Oh, god. Uh... oh.

02:33.904 --> 02:36.395
No, that's my leg.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.697
Come on.

02:38.784 --> 02:41.901
Come on. You're gonna go this way.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.031
- Oh, that's the phone.
- Crazy. Yeah...

02:44.122 --> 02:46.864
Oh, my god. Oh, no.
Okay. This is him.

02:46.958 --> 02:50.667
It's him. Oh, god. This is him.

02:54.716 --> 02:56.832
(Get over here. No.

02:56.927 --> 02:58.292
Oh, god.

03:03.558 --> 03:05.298
Come on.

03:05.394 --> 03:07.635
- Get inside.
- Ooh. Now, where have you been?

03:07.729 --> 03:10.141
Come, come, come, come, come.
Come. Gonna make this.

03:10.232 --> 03:13.850
Come on. Come on.

03:13.944 --> 03:15.104
I was walking the dog.

03:16.113 --> 03:18.149
Right... okay.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.855
Nervous energy before the show.

03:19.950 --> 03:22.236
Yeah... you look like shit.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.869
What's wrong with the way I look?

03:28.959 --> 03:31.701
You're not gonna believe
who called me today.

03:31.795 --> 03:34.377
I got a call from the fashion house.

03:34.464 --> 03:35.795
And?

03:35.882 --> 03:38.089
I didn't listen to it,
because I was a little scared...

03:38.176 --> 03:40.588
Okay.
You need to stop being so chickenshit.

03:40.679 --> 03:43.449
- I just wanted to listen to it with you.
- You can handle more than you think.

03:43.473 --> 03:44.963
- Okay. Well...
- Give it to me.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.472
Bonjour. I regret to inform you

03:49.563 --> 03:51.849
that we are declining
to carry your designs.

03:51.940 --> 03:54.352
We wish you the best of luck
with your future endeavors.

03:54.443 --> 03:55.979
Au revoir.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.214
It's okay. There's another message,
there's another one.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.399
Hi, honey. It's mom.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.690
I'm trying to send you
that thousand dollars you need...

04:05.537 --> 04:08.028
Are you borrowing money
from your parents again?

04:08.123 --> 04:10.785
- I'm such a mess.
- Oh, no, babe...

04:10.876 --> 04:12.958
- Everything's gone wrong.
- No, you're not a mess.

04:13.044 --> 04:15.581
You just... you just need
a little bit of tlc.

04:15.672 --> 04:16.832
That's all.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.630
Hey, look. You're gonna be great.

04:19.718 --> 04:23.085
Okay? I'll fix you up.
I'll fix all of this.

04:23.180 --> 04:24.949
They're gonna love you.
They're gonna love your designs,

04:24.973 --> 04:26.534
the buyers are going to give you an order

04:26.558 --> 04:29.265
that'll transcend
your wildest dreams, yeah?

04:29.352 --> 04:32.014
- Yeah?
- I don't know. If you say so.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.061
Okay. All right, love.

04:34.149 --> 04:36.856
Um, but maybe you should just
have 3 little shower first.

04:38.695 --> 04:42.153
Hello, thank you
for calling schmiegel ad agency.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.080
How can I direct your call?

04:52.375 --> 04:55.583
Tom? One day,
this will all be yours.

04:58.381 --> 05:01.248
I built this whole empire,

05:01.343 --> 05:05.928
and my number one achievement to this day,
mofo moonshine.

05:06.014 --> 05:08.096
I ook at this art. Look at it.

05:08.183 --> 05:10.925
"Lick, swallow, and suck.
No limes needed."

05:11.019 --> 05:15.638
It's like a Picasso of jizz
that came out of me onto this canvas.

05:15.732 --> 05:17.142
Yeah.

05:23.281 --> 05:25.897
I cannot do no wrong.

05:27.911 --> 05:30.152
He's early, so we are leaving.

05:31.248 --> 05:32.863
- Now.
- All right.

05:40.924 --> 05:43.711
Whoa... whoa, check this out.

05:43.802 --> 05:46.043
- Holy smokes!
- Hey, hey, wait. No, no, no, no...

05:46.137 --> 05:47.377
How do you turn this thing on?

05:47.472 --> 05:48.866
You're gonna break your neck.
Those things are death traps.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.993
They kill people all the time.
You can't even ride a bike.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.298
You're gonna shoot through the roof...

06:19.421 --> 06:21.787
Mr. Johnson,
if you can wait one moment to...

06:21.882 --> 06:25.170
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
No man stands in front of the boss.

06:26.469 --> 06:28.175
Unless little Jerry says so.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.509
Little Jerry, what do you say?

06:35.353 --> 06:36.559
He said it's okay.

06:36.646 --> 06:38.136
All right.
What do you got, Irene?

06:38.231 --> 06:40.688
Um, well, we have the projection
all set up for you.

06:40.775 --> 06:42.561
Come on. Wow me.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.563
Right. Okay. Well, you know,

06:44.654 --> 06:47.771
we were thinking to focus on this amazing
innovation you created, and...

06:47.866 --> 06:50.733
Well, uh, elon musk, he has innovation.

06:50.827 --> 06:53.239
- Next.
- Let's take the future technology

06:53.330 --> 06:55.821
and make it available
for the consumer today.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.248
Apple. Smart and affordable. Next.

07:02.088 --> 07:04.625
- What do you got?
- Bye-bye.

07:08.303 --> 07:11.170
"Johnson jetpacks.
Making the future fun again."

07:15.060 --> 07:16.846
What did you say?

07:16.937 --> 07:19.394
"Making the future fun again.”

07:19.481 --> 07:22.223
Well, Mr. Johnson, we're a quarter
of the way into the 21st century,

07:22.317 --> 07:25.730
but the future isn't nearly
as cool or wild as we dreamed.

07:25.820 --> 07:28.402
Until today.

07:28.490 --> 07:31.323
By making the future fun,
we open the world's imagination.

07:31.409 --> 07:32.470
- I mean, look at this thing.
- No, I...

07:32.494 --> 07:33.904
It is a beauty!

07:33.995 --> 07:35.598
This isn't just a jetpack
that you created.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.829
It's like a... it's like, uh...

07:37.916 --> 07:40.202
- A vibrator for the mind.
- Yes!

07:40.293 --> 07:41.874
It's like a vibrator for your mind.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.814
And what does the world need
more than vibration right now?

07:43.838 --> 07:45.703
Nothing. The world needs vibration.

07:45.799 --> 07:49.542
So why don't you get over here,
just strap on, ride hard,

07:49.636 --> 07:53.675
and blast off in a Johnson jetpack?

07:55.225 --> 07:57.557
Tomorrow...

07:57.644 --> 07:58.884
Is today.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.055
Idiots...

08:07.195 --> 08:09.186
You're saying it's like sex?

08:09.280 --> 08:12.317
Riding them hard and wet?
Tomorrow is today?

08:12.409 --> 08:13.740
Is that what you're telling me?

08:13.827 --> 08:15.818
I just wanna apologize, that was...

08:15.912 --> 08:18.324
It's genius! It's brilliant!

08:18.415 --> 08:20.810
Where were you hiding this guy?
You got a Don draper on your team.

08:20.834 --> 08:24.042
And you, vibrations.
Genius, genius.

08:24.129 --> 08:26.711
Why do you act so stupid?
And who are you?

08:26.798 --> 08:28.629
Uh, my name's Tom.

08:28.717 --> 08:29.877
- Tom.
- Tom,

08:29.968 --> 08:32.254
you're gonna be the new face
of the Johnson jetpack.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.802
Now put that helmet on.
Let me see you in that jetpack.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.133
- Good, good.
- Uh...

08:39.227 --> 08:41.808
- Model that baby.
- Uh, okay.

08:41.895 --> 08:43.102
Oh, I like it.

08:43.188 --> 08:45.555
I think it's... I think it's on, man.

08:45.650 --> 08:47.770
I think it's on. Get this off of me.

08:49.070 --> 08:50.856
Oh... shit.

08:53.825 --> 08:55.781
You pushed the wrong button.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.734
I told you this was stupid.

08:59.414 --> 09:01.996
Excellent! Watch your head.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.323
Stop!

09:04.961 --> 09:07.452
Man, that thing's way faster
than I thought it would be.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.879
Oh! That's gotta hurt.

09:09.966 --> 09:12.673
Oh, my gosh!

09:12.761 --> 09:14.297
What's he doing?

09:14.387 --> 09:16.673
Oh. Good thing he's wearing a helmet.

09:24.189 --> 09:26.896
Fuck you, Ricky!

09:26.983 --> 09:28.939
Look out!

09:34.699 --> 09:35.859
Hmm.

09:36.951 --> 09:39.067
Okay. The finishing touches.

09:40.371 --> 09:42.908
- All right.
- Don't do too much of that stuff.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.832
- Okay.
- Okay. Just a little.

09:45.919 --> 09:49.082
Why is this mascara so clumpy?

09:49.172 --> 09:51.254
Did it expire?
Does mascara expire?

09:51.341 --> 09:54.208
I don't know. Honestly,
I don't really care what I look like.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.133
It's not like I'm trying to get picked up.

09:56.221 --> 09:58.303
Yeah, because that would be a nightmare.

09:58.389 --> 10:01.426
Men are a pointless distraction.

10:01.518 --> 10:03.429
That's kind of the point, babe.

10:04.521 --> 10:08.935
Speaking of distractions,
I sent Molly out for the night.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.357
Thank god.
She's a roommate from hell.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.047
I don't know.
I think that I have enough on.

10:13.071 --> 10:15.187
Is this... am I good?
Do I look...

10:15.281 --> 10:16.987
You look beautiful.

10:24.624 --> 10:28.742
Honestly, I just really need this to work.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.252
It's going to be great.

10:32.340 --> 10:33.955
It's gonna be a hit.

10:34.050 --> 10:37.383
Those bitches have never looked better.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.711
- Do you really mean that?
- Yes, I do.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.046
Okay.

10:44.102 --> 10:46.388
Well, let's go kill it.

10:46.479 --> 10:49.061
Yeah, let's go kill it.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.891
And we have miss kesha
rockefeller Jones.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.067
She will go "boom, boom" in your room

10:54.154 --> 10:59.148
in a custom jumpsuit
made of authentic Jersey polyester.

11:04.873 --> 11:08.741
Is that my boxed wine?
Someone's gonna have to pay for that.

11:08.835 --> 11:11.542
Molly? What are you doing here?

11:11.629 --> 11:14.371
Tonight is my doggy fashion show.

11:14.465 --> 11:16.251
I thought you were joking.

11:16.342 --> 11:18.082
Uh, okay.

11:18.178 --> 11:21.045
So, Laura, why don't you get
our next doggy model ready?

11:21.139 --> 11:24.302
And, Molly,
why don't you go to your room?

11:24.392 --> 11:27.304
Now. We can...
Kind of little busy here.

11:27.395 --> 11:29.727
I brought Laura a friend.

11:31.399 --> 11:33.890
Because everyone knows
that she could use a good fuck.

11:33.985 --> 11:37.773
Okay. That's enough.
Just... go to your room.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.195
This one's for you.

11:39.282 --> 11:42.695
- Meet Mateo.
- I'm Matias. He's Mateo.

11:45.622 --> 11:49.035
Mateo. Ma-tat-o.
Who gives a fuck?

11:49.125 --> 11:50.615
He's hot and horny,

11:50.710 --> 11:53.873
and he has hasn't shot a load
in over two weeks.

11:53.963 --> 11:57.421
Get ready because his dick's gonna be like
a McDonald's milkshake machine.

12:00.345 --> 12:03.837
Okay. Isn't she a riot?

12:03.932 --> 12:06.799
Okay. Can you please just leave?

12:06.893 --> 12:08.178
Yeah.

12:08.269 --> 12:09.805
Fine.

12:09.896 --> 12:12.057
I was gonna share,
but since you're being so rude,

12:12.148 --> 12:14.264
I won't. Come on.

12:14.359 --> 12:17.851
Where were we?

12:20.990 --> 12:24.107
Are you sure
these people are real buyers?

12:25.286 --> 12:27.948
Yes. I found them online.
They had great reviews.

12:28.039 --> 12:30.405
Huh. Who's the charmer?

12:30.500 --> 12:33.708
He's a pet core representative.
Employee of the month.

12:33.795 --> 12:39.131
- And the cat lady?
- Uh, she's the owner of feline's behinds.

12:40.134 --> 12:43.376
- And... Judas?
- Uh, he just showed up.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.342
Oh, okay.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.077
- Laura, why don't you get...
- This isn't happening,

12:48.101 --> 12:50.262
- this isn't happening.
- Our next doggie model?

12:58.945 --> 13:02.028
Yeah, that's my boy, whoo-hoo!

13:04.742 --> 13:08.655
Fuck, yeah! Oh, yeah!
Oh, daddy, hit the spot!

13:08.746 --> 13:10.577
Oh, fuck!

13:10.665 --> 13:12.265
Oh, yeah!

13:12.292 --> 13:13.828
Oh, fuck!

13:13.918 --> 13:15.454
Oh, fuck, daddy! Keep going.

13:15.545 --> 13:17.331
Keep going. Oh, yeah!

13:17.422 --> 13:19.708
Oh, fuck. Slap that ass! Slap it!

13:19.799 --> 13:21.960
Fuck, yeah.

13:22.051 --> 13:25.293
Oh, yeah.

13:25.388 --> 13:26.468
Oh, yeah!

13:26.556 --> 13:29.468
- This house needs an exorcism.
- Oh! Oh, yeah!

13:29.559 --> 13:32.266
Uh, okay.
Look, look, um, just wait.

13:32.353 --> 13:35.140
The... the... tuxedo. Tuxedo.

13:35.231 --> 13:39.349
You haven't seen anything yet.
This is the grand finale.

13:39.444 --> 13:43.778
What kind of bridal party would it be
if your little furry friends,

13:43.865 --> 13:47.198
furry friends couldn't
walk down the aisle with them?

13:47.285 --> 13:53.406
You'll say "I do"
to the exquisite designs of doggie style.

14:03.801 --> 14:06.167
Look, I'm just the cashier for pet core.

14:06.262 --> 14:08.469
I think I responded
to the wrong ad. Sorry.

14:08.556 --> 14:11.047
Um, do these come in human sizes”?

14:11.142 --> 14:14.634
Um, also I need to pee,
where's your litter box? Meow.

14:14.729 --> 14:18.938
Uh, where did you find these morons?

14:22.528 --> 14:24.109
Who's next?

14:25.698 --> 14:28.690
- This was an awful idea.
- Hey, no, no, no, no.

14:28.785 --> 14:31.401
We will come up with a plan, okay?

14:32.955 --> 14:35.492
Speaking of plans,
either of you have a plan b pill?

14:35.583 --> 14:38.495
Mr. Argentina forgot to pull out.

14:40.129 --> 14:46.170
Okay, look, you lazy, selfish,
irresponsible nympho alcoholic.

14:46.260 --> 14:48.251
I am not lazy.

14:49.389 --> 14:53.132
And you look awfully tense.
Wanna fuck?

14:56.187 --> 15:00.556
Our roommate is going through
a very difficult time right now.

15:00.650 --> 15:04.643
I think that some words of encouragement
would be very much appreciated.

15:04.737 --> 15:08.229
Sure. Rent's due tomorrow.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.651
I'm gonna kill her in her sleep.

15:12.745 --> 15:13.825
Hey.

15:18.584 --> 15:21.166
Let's have a drink, babe.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.710
We'll get it next time.

15:23.798 --> 15:24.878
Next time.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.874
Jj

15:29.470 --> 15:32.712
Gold. Something gold.

15:32.807 --> 15:34.343
Gold, uh... gold, um...

15:34.434 --> 15:36.846
Gold ideas... gold idea...

15:44.610 --> 15:46.646
Here's your order.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.901
Hey, uh, are you guys hiring?

15:50.992 --> 15:53.108
I've never worked in a food truck before.

15:53.202 --> 15:55.818
Benny...
Benny and the jetpacks, yup.

15:55.913 --> 15:57.824
That's a good one.
That's a good... that...

15:57.915 --> 15:59.405
We can put some good music to that.

15:59.500 --> 16:02.333
- You want an application?
- I'd... yeah. Sure. Okay.

16:02.420 --> 16:03.751
Thank you.

16:03.838 --> 16:06.119
Oh, lady, and take one of these.
It'll help you chill out.

16:07.467 --> 16:10.550
Thanks. I guess.

16:12.555 --> 16:14.420
Hey, do you have a pen?

16:14.515 --> 16:17.598
Excuse me, do you have a pen?

16:17.685 --> 16:21.928
Nobody has a pen. Great.

16:22.023 --> 16:23.479
I have a pen if you...

16:23.566 --> 16:25.648
Don't mind red.

16:25.735 --> 16:27.726
I love red.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.811
- Thanks.
- Uh, here.

16:29.906 --> 16:32.113
- Is this lingerie?
- No, I got it. Don't...

16:32.200 --> 16:33.235
Don't worry about it.

16:33.326 --> 16:36.443
- They're tutus.
- Tutus for dogs. Wow.

16:36.537 --> 16:37.537
I'm a designer.

16:37.622 --> 16:39.203
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:40.208 --> 16:41.914
That's pretty, uh...

16:42.001 --> 16:43.366
- Kind of stupid.
- Brilliant.

16:45.254 --> 16:47.290
- You really think so?
- Yeah. Yeah.

16:47.381 --> 16:49.622
I mean, can I buy one from you?

16:49.717 --> 16:51.048
Do you have a dog?

16:51.135 --> 16:52.841
I don't...
No, I don't have a dog.

16:54.305 --> 16:56.466
Yeah, I'd probably
fit it around one of my legs.

17:00.102 --> 17:02.593
That is the first time
I've smiled in over a week.

17:02.688 --> 17:04.598
Well, you have a nice smile.

17:04.690 --> 17:07.477
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, you do.

17:08.486 --> 17:10.897
No one wants to buy any of my designs.

17:12.323 --> 17:14.405
Well, I mean, I...
I work in advertising.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.983
I can help you come up
with some new stuff maybe and...

17:17.078 --> 17:18.693
Over dinner or, uh...

17:20.540 --> 17:23.577
Okay. But it...
As long as it's not a date.

17:23.667 --> 17:26.125
What, you got something against...

17:26.212 --> 17:27.452
- Against dating dudes?
- No.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.788
I just told myself
I'm not gonna date anybody

17:29.882 --> 17:32.123
until I make
my first business transaction.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.379
Oh, well, then we...
We gotta get on this.

17:34.470 --> 17:35.755
- Yeah.
- Time's wasting.

17:41.394 --> 17:42.554
Poodle skirts.

17:42.645 --> 17:44.260
Poodle skirts for poodles.

17:44.355 --> 17:47.847
- Okay, you got some good ideas.
- Right? Rottweilers in leather.

17:47.942 --> 17:49.342
Leather jackets around their butts.

17:53.239 --> 17:56.322
It was electric from the day we met.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.149
Thanks to everyone for coming

17:58.244 --> 18:01.532
and spending some time with us
before the big day.

18:01.622 --> 18:05.285
We're really looking forward
to the trip with both families.

18:05.376 --> 18:06.866
I've never been happier.

18:08.170 --> 18:10.536
Thank you so much for saying yes, Laura.

18:10.631 --> 18:12.838
Of course. That was beautiful.

18:13.843 --> 18:15.959
That was beautiful.
Thank you so much.

18:16.053 --> 18:18.465
Hey, did everybody get enough to eat?

18:18.556 --> 18:19.556
- Oh, yeah.
- It was good.

18:19.640 --> 18:20.951
- I could use...
- It was good. Thank you.

18:20.975 --> 18:22.619
- Another one of these.
- You guys are adorable.

18:22.643 --> 18:24.975
I'm so happy to be
joining your family,

18:25.062 --> 18:26.290
Mr. and Mrs. rothstein.

18:26.314 --> 18:28.020
Always a pleasure.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.847
- Ahem.
- I'm sorry. It's jetlag.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.356
Oh, what's the matter, Lance?

18:37.450 --> 18:40.112
Nothing.
I'm really happy for you two.

18:40.202 --> 18:41.567
But can I ask?

18:41.662 --> 18:43.323
Why do we all have to fly down

18:43.414 --> 18:46.406
to this Caribbean hellhole
for these nuptials?

18:46.500 --> 18:48.456
Why not have them at home?
Why not Canada?

18:48.544 --> 18:50.000
Lance, you're not even Canadian.

18:52.757 --> 18:54.668
Lance, what's wrong with you?

18:54.759 --> 18:57.029
- Don't you know where you're from?
- Ricky, please shut up.

18:57.053 --> 18:59.089
Oh, you hadn't heard?

18:59.180 --> 19:00.761
I'm an orphan.

19:00.848 --> 19:02.008
Oh, here we go.

19:02.099 --> 19:03.839
I didn't know you were adopted.

19:03.934 --> 19:05.595
Oh, that's true. I'm an orphan.

19:05.686 --> 19:08.678
All I ever really wanted
was to be taken in...

19:08.773 --> 19:10.751
By a kind family and then finally...

19:10.775 --> 19:12.002
Manfred? Manfred...

19:12.026 --> 19:14.563
These loving parents
came along and adopted me

19:14.654 --> 19:16.986
because they couldn't have
children on their own.

19:17.073 --> 19:18.188
It's. It's true.

19:19.617 --> 19:21.733
Until they did have a real kid, right?

19:21.827 --> 19:23.692
They were finally able to conceive

19:23.788 --> 19:27.747
and they had the miracle biological child,
the golden girl,

19:27.833 --> 19:31.576
and she just kind of, I don't know,
just took up all the love

19:31.671 --> 19:34.834
and old Lance just kind of got
lost in the shuffle.

19:36.634 --> 19:39.250
- The hell am I missing here?
- My life.

19:39.345 --> 19:42.257
- Well, that's nice.
- Okay. Well...

19:42.348 --> 19:44.179
You sound successful.

19:44.266 --> 19:48.680
- Wow. It's so soft.
- Sherry, manfred, Lexi, thank you.

19:48.771 --> 19:53.640
And to your son, Tom,
I'd just like to say, uh,

19:53.734 --> 19:58.319
son, if you break her heart,
I'll kill you.

20:06.747 --> 20:08.578
That's a joke. It's just a joke.

20:08.666 --> 20:10.577
Good speech.

20:11.711 --> 20:14.578
- He's joking, he's joking. It's a joke.
- It's such a funny joke.

20:30.688 --> 20:32.644
Hi, super cute couple.

20:32.732 --> 20:35.599
Can I offer you
a pre-wedding trip beverage?

20:35.693 --> 20:37.024
Actually, I had a question.

20:37.111 --> 20:38.772
Um, when I was coming onto the plane,

20:38.863 --> 20:41.821
somebody was telling me
about, um, a club mile high,

20:41.907 --> 20:44.523
and I was wondering if...

20:44.618 --> 20:48.952
Um, is that like a credit card thing
where you have to sign up or do you, um...

20:49.039 --> 20:52.156
Do you get extra miles from that? Is it...

20:57.506 --> 21:00.213
Rude... rude people on this plane...
Hey, baby, hey.

21:00.301 --> 21:01.632
- What happened?
- Nothing...

21:01.719 --> 21:03.300
I'm just checking.
Are you... you okay?

21:03.387 --> 21:06.220
You... you seem like
you were just like zoned out.

21:06.307 --> 21:09.470
Not... not really, no.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.892
Yeah, what's... what's going on?

21:11.979 --> 21:14.846
- I just feel anxious and I...
- Oh, the flight?

21:14.940 --> 21:16.430
No, it's just the wedding.

21:16.525 --> 21:18.390
I just wanna make sure
everybody has fun.

21:18.486 --> 21:19.942
I just want this to be great.

21:20.029 --> 21:22.987
Babe, it's gonna be fantastic.
We prepped...

21:23.073 --> 21:24.813
- Okay.
- The shit out of this wedding.

21:24.909 --> 21:26.553
Okay. Just keep telling me that.
I need to hear it.

21:26.577 --> 21:28.305
We prepped the shit out of this wedding.
Say it with me.

21:28.329 --> 21:29.681
- We prepped the shit...
- Prepped the shit

21:29.705 --> 21:31.036
out of this wedding, yeah.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.283
- Okay.
- Yeah, we're good.

21:32.374 --> 21:33.910
Okay. Thanks, babe.
I feel better.

21:34.001 --> 21:35.812
- Great. Now just...
- I feel... I'm just gonna try to sleep.

21:35.836 --> 21:39.078
- Great. Just relax and...
- Okay.

21:52.353 --> 21:54.218
Do you wanna move over one?

21:55.564 --> 21:57.805
No, I really like the middle seat.

21:57.900 --> 22:00.642
Okay. I need you to take
your hand off my leg.

22:00.736 --> 22:02.522
- That's your leg?
- Yes.

22:02.613 --> 22:03.853
Do you moisturize it?

22:04.949 --> 22:06.689
I need you to remove your hand,

22:06.784 --> 22:10.322
or I'm going to show you
why my favorite movie is rocky!

22:10.412 --> 22:12.198
Jesus.

22:13.290 --> 22:14.496
Hey.

22:49.910 --> 22:51.571
It's just turbulence.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.322
Ricky doesn't care.

22:59.920 --> 23:03.629
Oh, shit, you broke my nose!

23:03.716 --> 23:05.047
Damn it.

23:05.134 --> 23:07.195
Ladies and gentlemen,
due to severe weather,

23:07.219 --> 23:09.631
we're being rerouted
to the island of Jamaica.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.758
Cabin crew, prepare for landing.

23:21.275 --> 23:22.731
Babe...

23:22.818 --> 23:26.606
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Uh... put your seatbelt on.

23:27.615 --> 23:29.697
- We're here?
- We're close.

23:29.783 --> 23:32.525
Okay. Okay.

23:38.626 --> 23:39.895
Until further notice,

23:39.919 --> 23:43.411
all flights to the Bahamas are cancelled
due to severe weather.

23:43.505 --> 23:46.838
We're supposed to be
getting married in four days.

23:46.926 --> 23:48.862
Babe, it's gonna be fine, okay?
We're gonna get...

23:48.886 --> 23:50.071
How are we gonna find a resort?

23:50.095 --> 23:52.449
I'm... I'll... I'll take care of it.
It's just gonna be a minor hurdle.

23:52.473 --> 23:54.509
- There's no way.
- I think this is very exciting.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.181
Yeah. And pretty scary, eh?

23:56.268 --> 23:58.179
Representative, please.

23:58.270 --> 24:01.683
Your call
is very important to us. Please...

24:01.774 --> 24:03.627
- Get our flights figured out.
- No, no... it's gonna be okay.

24:03.651 --> 24:05.629
It's gonna be great. Okay?
And I'm gonna get a hotel for us,

24:05.653 --> 24:06.922
and we're gonna...
I'm gonna find...

24:06.946 --> 24:08.652
I didn't pack...

24:15.037 --> 24:17.119
- Yeah, mon.
- No seeds and stems, all right?

24:17.206 --> 24:18.571
No guarantees, mon.

24:18.666 --> 24:21.203
Come on, dude, hook me up, hook me up.

24:21.293 --> 24:23.659

24:29.635 --> 24:32.547
Hey, mon! Welcome to my island.

24:32.638 --> 24:35.755

You like them girls?

an emergency land here,

24:42.731 --> 24:44.250

Oh, I'm not into you in that way,
uh, I'm not gay or anything.

25:48.422 --> 25:50.358
Not... not that I have any problem
with anybody who is gay.

25:50.382 --> 25:52.748
It's just I tried it out once
before I got married,

25:52.843 --> 25:55.755

you know what I mean?

25:55.846 --> 25:58.883

Welcome, friends.

26:36.845 --> 26:38.005
My name is Winston and...

26:38.097 --> 26:39.928
We... we've had a very long day.

26:40.015 --> 26:41.505
Ira said our rooms would be ready.

26:42.518 --> 26:44.725
Sorry, we're just really tired, eh.

26:44.812 --> 26:47.428
- And a little emotional.
- Where's the bar?

27:01.620 --> 27:03.235
- Papa?
- Hmm?

27:03.330 --> 27:07.414
Our daughter is only getting
married once... I hope.

27:07.501 --> 27:10.538
And if you wanna sit back,
relax, and massage those toes,

27:10.629 --> 27:11.789
you deserve it.

27:11.880 --> 27:16.294
No, no, no. We deserve it, mama.

27:16.385 --> 27:19.172
Should I slip into something
more comfortable?

27:19.263 --> 27:21.504
Ooh, I like that idea.

27:21.598 --> 27:23.509
This was my mama's muumuul.

27:23.600 --> 27:25.682
I always liked your mama, eh?

27:25.769 --> 27:28.602
I'll be back.

27:42.369 --> 27:44.280
Not bad.

27:44.371 --> 27:45.781
Not bad at all.

27:47.207 --> 27:48.207
Hmm.

27:54.381 --> 27:56.497
Ooh, jackpot.

27:57.509 --> 27:58.919
Hey, blondie, where you going?

27:59.011 --> 28:00.811
I'm going back to my room.
What are you doing?

28:01.763 --> 28:04.300
Can I join you?

28:04.391 --> 28:05.847
Sure.

28:05.934 --> 28:08.346
- Are you sure?
- Why not?

28:08.437 --> 28:11.600
- Me? Really?
- Yeah.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.021
- Let's go.
- Okay.

28:13.108 --> 28:15.815
- Are you sure?
- Are you gonna take good care of me?

28:15.903 --> 28:17.985
I mean, this isn't a prank, is it?

28:21.617 --> 28:24.825
Baby, I am the luckiest guy in the world.

28:24.912 --> 28:28.905
Tell me about it. Maybe we should
just stay here for the rest of vacation.

28:28.999 --> 28:30.739
So down.

28:30.834 --> 28:33.746
Hey, look, I know that this,
you know, isn't what we planned,

28:33.837 --> 28:36.232
and I know the past few days have been
an emotional rollercoaster,

28:36.256 --> 28:37.256
to say the least.

28:37.341 --> 28:40.583
But I promise you, you're gonna have
the wedding of your dreams, okay?

28:40.677 --> 28:42.838
- You do?
- Yeah.

28:42.930 --> 28:44.730
I have a really good feeling
about this place.

28:45.599 --> 28:49.387
Okay. I know it's not
what we planned, but...

28:49.478 --> 28:50.968
I trust you.

28:51.063 --> 28:54.226
- I love you.
- I love you,

28:54.316 --> 28:58.184
- Mr. mcgursky-Fairfax rothstein.
- Oh, no, no, no.

28:58.278 --> 29:00.735
It's Mr. Fairfax rothstein-mcgursky
if we're gonna do that.

29:00.822 --> 29:03.029
Oh, well, looks like you have
some convincing to do.

29:03.116 --> 29:04.902
I don't think so. Okay.

29:05.994 --> 29:07.985
Jj

29:27.808 --> 29:29.548
This is where you'll be married...

29:31.228 --> 29:33.469
On your very special day.

29:33.563 --> 29:35.053
What do you think?

29:36.233 --> 29:37.769
We love it.

29:37.859 --> 29:39.690
Wonderful.

29:45.993 --> 29:48.234
Look at these trees!

29:48.328 --> 29:50.535
This place is paradise!

29:52.374 --> 29:54.990
- You all right there, papa?
- Right behind you, mama.

29:55.085 --> 29:57.167
Exactly where I like you.

29:57.254 --> 29:58.835
I trained you well.

29:58.922 --> 30:00.958
- Oh, oh!
- What is it? What is it?

30:02.384 --> 30:03.999
Do you know what that is?

30:04.094 --> 30:06.050
- What is it?
- If I'm right,

30:06.138 --> 30:08.129
the girls at simonson's
portage trail nature club

30:08.223 --> 30:09.679
are gonna be green with envy.

30:09.766 --> 30:12.678
I think
that's a lesser antilles bullfinch.

30:12.769 --> 30:14.760
- The less... the lesser?
- The lesser.

30:14.855 --> 30:17.096
The only species of bird

30:17.190 --> 30:20.774
where the female eats her mate
after she copulates.

30:22.279 --> 30:24.770
- Oh.
- What's that?

30:27.617 --> 30:29.027
Yes.

30:33.874 --> 30:36.581
Oh, oh, you okay? - Yes!

30:36.668 --> 30:39.660
Oh, bird spunk!

30:39.755 --> 30:41.711
Nice.

30:41.798 --> 30:42.958
A souvenir!

30:43.050 --> 30:44.460
Oh, yeah.

30:44.551 --> 30:46.712
Betty Jean Davidson
can't top that.

30:46.803 --> 30:48.803
All right.
Close your eyes, keep them closed.

30:50.974 --> 30:53.135
You're... you're...
Don't ruin the surprise.

30:53.226 --> 30:55.538
All right. Here we go.
All right. Open your mouth, give me...

30:55.562 --> 30:56.562
Give me a little tongue.

30:58.523 --> 31:00.418
And, okay, what do you...
What do you think of that one?

31:00.442 --> 31:01.978
- So good.
- Right?

31:02.069 --> 31:03.184
- So good.
- Yeah.

31:03.278 --> 31:04.609
- So, now...
- That's the one.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.466
No, no, no, you gotta try more,
you gotta try them all.

31:06.490 --> 31:08.026
- Oh, my gosh.
- All right.

31:09.659 --> 31:12.992
All right. What do you
think of that one? Oh.

31:13.080 --> 31:14.160
Okay.

31:14.247 --> 31:17.159
That one's really good, too.
Did you try that one?

31:18.502 --> 31:19.502
What?

31:30.847 --> 31:32.633
I think...
I think it's a Caribbean thing.

31:34.059 --> 31:35.424
Yeah. It's the...

31:35.519 --> 31:37.885
Probably the only person
like that we're gonna see.

31:37.979 --> 31:40.436
She probably...
She's a native, I think.

31:51.201 --> 31:53.317
Okay. Okay.

31:53.412 --> 31:56.575
Mr. manfred, sir.
How you doing, mon?

31:56.665 --> 31:57.745
Bloody Mary, please.

31:57.833 --> 32:01.417
Look, I know you're a very busy man,
you're here on vacation with your family,

32:01.503 --> 32:05.212
but I would love to schedule some time
to talk about my business proposal.

32:05.298 --> 32:07.664
Open up the dry cleaning
here on the island.

32:07.759 --> 32:10.717
Get this, one-hour dry cleaning.

32:10.804 --> 32:13.090
Well, hello, handsome.

32:13.181 --> 32:15.797
Sorry, I'm, uh, I'm actually
married, I don't swing.

32:15.892 --> 32:19.476
- I love me a silver fox.
- We'll talk, Mr. manfred.

32:19.563 --> 32:21.303
What's your name?

32:21.398 --> 32:24.078
What's a silver fox?
I'm sorry, do we know each other?

32:39.916 --> 32:43.374
- Hi, darling.
- Hi, ladies.

32:47.382 --> 32:50.249
You know, it's been years since I've had
a professional massage.

32:51.553 --> 32:55.762
Not quite sure how I feel about another
man's hands running all over my body.

32:55.849 --> 32:59.842
I think papa would prefer it
if I had a lady.

32:59.936 --> 33:01.426
Where's the fun in that?

33:01.521 --> 33:04.763
Uh, when's the last time
your husband gave you a proper massage?

33:04.858 --> 33:06.223
You know, you're right.

33:06.318 --> 33:09.105
Papa usually just likes
to get right to it.

33:09.196 --> 33:12.154
Last time your father used his mouth
for anything other than...

33:12.240 --> 33:13.676
- Mom, come on.
- Yes, dear, you're right.

33:13.700 --> 33:16.032
- That's too much information.
- No! Too much. Uh-uh.

33:16.119 --> 33:17.305
I'm sorry. Yes, you're right.
You're right.

33:17.329 --> 33:18.535
- No.
- I apologize. I don't...

33:18.622 --> 33:21.705
I just hope that my masseur has,
like, strong hands, you know.

33:57.953 --> 34:01.741
Hello. Are you ladies ready?

34:02.749 --> 34:05.661
Oh... oh.

34:06.962 --> 34:08.418
Take that off. Take that ring off.

34:09.880 --> 34:12.418
Oh, my god, yes.

34:12.509 --> 34:13.748
Uh-huh.

34:13.842 --> 34:15.208
Mmm...

34:24.312 --> 34:27.224
Uh-huh.

34:27.315 --> 34:29.522
Mm-hm.

34:31.860 --> 34:33.567
That's great. Yeah.

34:36.199 --> 34:37.860
Mmm...

34:37.951 --> 34:39.235
You know, my family's here.

34:39.327 --> 34:41.283
I didn't realize
how stressful it was gonna be.

34:41.371 --> 34:45.239
Family is just
so boring, you know.

34:45.333 --> 34:48.791
Why bring family?
You should choose your friends.

34:48.878 --> 34:53.087
And I tell you what,
I can be your little friend.

34:55.510 --> 34:57.321
You know, actually,
I'm really excited, though,

34:57.345 --> 35:00.337
I can't wait to move on with Tom.

35:00.432 --> 35:03.139
I mean, I'm in it for life.
I'm excited.

35:03.226 --> 35:04.636
I can't wait, either.

35:04.728 --> 35:08.516
You see, uh, sometimes
the unexpected detours in life

35:08.607 --> 35:13.021
make the greatest adventure.

35:14.029 --> 35:15.314
That's a little low, sir.

35:15.405 --> 35:18.818
You were booked for the full package.

35:18.908 --> 35:21.024
- I'm getting married.
- I know.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.950
Congratulations.

35:26.082 --> 35:29.495
This is not what I meant
by full package!

35:29.586 --> 35:31.668
I'm sorry for the bad touch!

35:32.797 --> 35:35.129
Well, that got weird quick.

35:35.216 --> 35:36.706
I know, right?

35:36.801 --> 35:37.945
- Get out!
- Okay.

35:37.969 --> 35:40.426
Nobody touches
the honey pot but papa bear!

35:40.513 --> 35:42.049
That is one crazy white woman.

35:42.140 --> 35:45.974
Ah, just what the doctor ordered.
What are you looking at?

35:46.061 --> 35:48.518
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Mom?

35:48.605 --> 35:51.062
Oh, my god, what kind of a resort is this?

35:51.149 --> 35:53.390
I don't know, but I love it.

35:53.485 --> 35:56.648
Hey, where's the ocean?
That's what I'm talking about.

35:56.738 --> 36:00.401
Yay, get a little pina colada.
Pursue pleasure, indeed.

36:00.492 --> 36:01.857
A swingers resort, Tom?

36:01.951 --> 36:03.691
There is no way this is gonna work.

36:03.787 --> 36:07.154
We don't have food, flowers,
the little doily things for the table.

36:07.248 --> 36:09.268
Did you see that guy?
He was like a dick with teeth!

36:09.292 --> 36:12.284
So, is this what's it like
in your big American cities, then?

36:12.379 --> 36:13.664
No, it's Jamaica, man.

36:13.755 --> 36:15.211
Fortunately, I'm not a prude,

36:15.298 --> 36:17.058
because everything
around here is having sex,

36:17.133 --> 36:19.340
especially the birds.

36:19.427 --> 36:23.011
Well, this place is paradise!

36:23.098 --> 36:25.635
Lance, my boy.
How was your trip in, son?

36:25.725 --> 36:26.885
Pretty good. Pretty good.

36:26.976 --> 36:28.182
- Hi, Lance.
- Hi, mom.

36:28.269 --> 36:32.137
- Oh, where are we?
- This is the...

36:32.232 --> 36:35.645
I'm sorry, I'm just a little confused.
Why is everybody so upset?

36:35.735 --> 36:37.896
I mean, what's going on?
I mean, how happy are we

36:37.987 --> 36:40.603
that we're not up in manitoba
for this wedding, right?

36:44.160 --> 36:46.993
I'm getting married at a swingers resort.

36:50.500 --> 36:53.082
A swingers resort,
like a nudist colony?

36:53.169 --> 36:54.909
What... are you kidding me?

36:55.004 --> 36:57.666
All right, this all goes back to Tom.
This is Tom's fault.

36:57.757 --> 37:00.965
This is a nudist colony?
You're sick, buddy!

37:01.052 --> 37:05.011
All right. Everybody just calm down,
let's figure out a plan b.

37:09.561 --> 37:11.222
- Yup.
- Hi, there.

37:11.312 --> 37:13.177
I'm Lance,
are you the manager of this place?

37:13.273 --> 37:16.640
Absolutely. Make yourself comfortable,
take your jacket off.

37:16.735 --> 37:18.726
Okay, thank you.

37:18.820 --> 37:20.811
Thanks.

37:20.905 --> 37:22.508
Hey, while you're at it, go ahead
and take your pants off, too.

37:22.532 --> 37:25.069
- I'm sorry?
- If you want.

37:25.160 --> 37:27.572
My pants?

37:27.662 --> 37:29.323
Well, I'm okay, thanks.

37:32.292 --> 37:33.657
How can I help you, Larry?

37:33.752 --> 37:35.333
It's Lance, but that's okay.

37:35.420 --> 37:38.287
- Well, I wanted to lodge a com...
- Oh, you like that?

37:38.381 --> 37:40.463
It's my ex-wife, former guest.

37:40.550 --> 37:41.915
I wanted to lodge a complaint.

37:42.010 --> 37:43.625
Ooh...

37:44.637 --> 37:46.468
You had me worried for a second.

37:46.556 --> 37:49.423
I have a lot of guests come in
here wanting to lodge something,

37:49.517 --> 37:50.723
usually not complaints.

37:52.979 --> 37:58.849
Upper management, at a beautiful
adult swingers resort.

37:58.943 --> 38:00.149
And for the life of me,

38:00.236 --> 38:04.320
I cannot walk out those office doors
without a top or bottom.

38:04.407 --> 38:06.318
Can I help you, Larry?

38:06.409 --> 38:11.119
Well, uh, first of all, this is a topnotch
resort, so congratulations to you.

38:11.206 --> 38:13.309
Um, I was just... had a question
about the activities.

38:13.333 --> 38:17.076
There's zip line, paragliding,
bungee jumping.

38:17.170 --> 38:21.254
All nude. Those are all totally nude
activities you've mentioned.

38:21.341 --> 38:23.172
That's true.

38:23.259 --> 38:26.797
Actually, the bungee jump is closed
due to an incident last week.

38:26.888 --> 38:30.597
A guy, older fellow...
Late 70s, early 80s... jumps.

38:30.683 --> 38:34.551
Old-timer's got incredible form,
his head is at a safe distance,

38:34.646 --> 38:39.185
but his balls extend just enough
to tap the sand really hard.

38:40.193 --> 38:42.149
Put him in the hospital...

38:42.237 --> 38:43.727
Died the next day.

38:44.823 --> 38:46.609
I'm sorry to hear that.

38:46.699 --> 38:50.112
Nothing related to the bungee jump.

38:50.203 --> 38:52.194
My condolences.

38:52.288 --> 38:53.682
I think I understand
what's happening here.

38:53.706 --> 38:55.992
Look, my sister is getting married
this weekend,

38:56.084 --> 38:57.665
albeit to a total putz,

38:57.752 --> 38:59.868
but still, I wanna make sure
it's special for her

38:59.963 --> 39:01.874
and not a sex surge, do you understand?

39:01.965 --> 39:03.956
Jj

39:12.851 --> 39:15.092
I got to thank you for your concerns.

39:15.186 --> 39:20.351
I'm taking baby steps to improving
the staff tact around here,

39:20.441 --> 39:21.726
you know what I mean?

39:21.818 --> 39:24.025
I think you do.

39:24.112 --> 39:26.068
Here's what I'm gonna do for you, Vance.

39:26.155 --> 39:28.441
To make sure your stay is comfortable,

39:28.533 --> 39:32.071
I'm gonna give you groupons
to our best clothing optional classes.

39:32.161 --> 39:34.868
Try to enjoy yourselves.
Take it slow, too.

39:37.166 --> 39:40.454
And that's my advice to you,
Vince, that you do the same.

39:43.089 --> 39:46.047
Oh, look, yoga class, look at that move.

39:46.134 --> 39:48.045
Oh...

39:48.136 --> 39:52.129
Well, no, that is nude yoga.
She is flexible.

39:55.101 --> 39:57.092
Jj

40:12.201 --> 40:14.237
No, bill, can you hear me?

40:15.788 --> 40:17.699
Sure you don't wanna
come with us?

40:20.752 --> 40:25.621
Look, I hate to have to say this, pal,
but, uh, we're enemies now.

40:25.715 --> 40:28.457
You ought to know something about me, Tom.

40:28.551 --> 40:31.793
I have a certain set of skills.
Do you know what krav maga is?

40:32.805 --> 40:34.045
No.

40:34.140 --> 40:36.802
See this, Tom? It's a fist.

40:36.893 --> 40:40.681
And it might be small,
delicate even, like a snowflake,

40:40.772 --> 40:44.356
but it's not the size that matters.
It's what you do with it.

40:44.442 --> 40:49.027
If you so much as harm
my baby sister in the slightest,

40:49.113 --> 40:52.355
not even the splendid Canadian
nationalized healthcare system

40:52.450 --> 40:54.065
will be able to save you.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.993
And by the way,
that hat's fucking stupid.

40:58.539 --> 41:00.905
Lance, you should come, buddy.

41:01.000 --> 41:05.164
We got a bunch of guys,
no women, it's a perfect sausage-fest.

41:05.254 --> 41:08.496
I like you, Rick, I do,
but, uh, I got a meeting.

41:08.591 --> 41:10.377
Lance, son.

41:10.468 --> 41:12.834
That boy...

41:12.929 --> 41:17.969
Won't swim, won't play hockey,
always got an excuse.

41:34.450 --> 41:36.486
This day has been so good.

41:36.577 --> 41:38.818
You boys done got your sea legs, mon?

41:38.913 --> 41:40.073
Yeah, mon.

41:40.164 --> 41:42.200
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Yeah.

41:43.751 --> 41:45.707
Canadian beer, looks good...

41:47.839 --> 41:49.750
Wow, but it's not.

41:49.841 --> 41:53.584
Moose knuckle, that's funny.

41:53.678 --> 41:56.010
Tom, mama says
you designed this label.

41:56.097 --> 41:57.337
Yeah, I did.

41:57.432 --> 41:59.093
Wait, wait.
You designed this label, Tom?

41:59.183 --> 42:00.593
Mm-hmm.

42:00.685 --> 42:02.676
- Oh, that's pretty cool, pal.
- Thanks, dad.

42:02.770 --> 42:04.476
Can I get you boys some weed?

42:04.564 --> 42:08.102
Home grown,
I call it the rasta Jew, man.

42:08.192 --> 42:09.545
- That's what I call it, man.
- No, I...

42:09.569 --> 42:12.311
I'd end up on the front of that boat
passed out.

42:12.405 --> 42:14.111
That's what happened to the captain.

42:14.198 --> 42:16.439
That's why I'm driving the boat.

42:16.534 --> 42:18.149
- Rasta Jew?
- Yeah, man.

42:18.244 --> 42:19.905
- I'm in.
- Yeah, man.

42:55.698 --> 42:57.734
Goddamn.

42:57.825 --> 43:00.282
This is exactly what my old buns needed.

43:01.871 --> 43:03.407
- Mine, too.
- Oh, oh.

43:03.498 --> 43:05.238
What do you all know about being old?

43:05.333 --> 43:08.040
I have shoes older than the both of you.

43:08.127 --> 43:11.540
- I have a present for you.
- Georgia, where'd you get...

43:11.631 --> 43:13.963
- Nice.
- You light that thing up.

43:14.050 --> 43:18.919
Oh! Oh, it's been over 30 years
since I've had a whiff of them, um...

43:19.013 --> 43:22.050
Weed, grass, ganja, gateway drug, yeah.

43:23.559 --> 43:25.675
You know, it seems like just yesterday

43:25.770 --> 43:30.355
we were at kappa delta pi,
doing jello shots off the swim team boys.

43:30.441 --> 43:31.919
Honestly, we'd start with one up here

43:31.943 --> 43:33.962
- and then you sort of work your way down.
- Hey, Georgia?

43:33.986 --> 43:37.353
Stop, that's my mother-in-law.

43:37.448 --> 43:40.190
At the end of the semester,
I had no gag reflex.

43:40.284 --> 43:42.366
That's the only thing
I got out of college, too.

43:42.453 --> 43:45.536
- Right?
- Honey, I am sure that Sherry and I

43:45.623 --> 43:49.207
both have done things we're not
necessarily proud of in our past.

43:49.293 --> 43:51.284
- I used to be a very dirty girl.
- Mom, stop it.

43:51.379 --> 43:52.940
- No.
- Very. They used to call me mud pie.

43:52.964 --> 43:53.964
Nol

44:05.935 --> 44:08.096
How you doing?
You got anything, uh,

44:08.187 --> 44:11.679
kind of healthy for somebody
who's trying to get back into shape?

44:11.774 --> 44:15.141
- I got that weed.
- Okay. Thank you.

44:15.236 --> 44:16.851
Looks great. Appreciate it.

44:16.946 --> 44:17.981
I'll have one of those.

44:20.575 --> 44:23.487
You know what?
It's on me, there you go.

44:23.578 --> 44:25.614
It's all-inclusive.

44:25.705 --> 44:27.536
Okay, well, second one's on me, too.

44:27.623 --> 44:29.739
Oh, you're such a gentleman.

44:29.834 --> 44:31.290
Where I come from, I believe...

44:31.377 --> 44:33.288
It's my theory that a woman
such as yourself

44:33.379 --> 44:35.836
should, you know, be treated like a lady.

44:35.923 --> 44:38.039
Where are you from?

44:38.134 --> 44:41.626
I'm from Canada
by way of, uh, Mississippi.

44:42.763 --> 44:45.254
How can you be Canadian from Mississippi?

44:46.309 --> 44:51.303
Well, it's...
Uh, it's a little complicated, you know?

44:51.397 --> 44:54.264
I know complicated.
I was left at the altar.

44:54.358 --> 44:56.895
I woke up yesterday
and my fiancé was gone.

44:58.946 --> 45:03.189
Uh... you were left at the altar?

45:04.619 --> 45:06.905
I'd like to meet the son of a bitch,
excuse my language,

45:06.996 --> 45:08.406
that left you at the altar.

45:08.497 --> 45:10.863
That was crazy enough
to leave you at the altar

45:10.958 --> 45:13.040
and teach him a thing or two
about chivalry.

45:13.127 --> 45:15.038
What, teach him...
Teach him about some weed?

45:15.129 --> 45:16.494
No, thanks. Not right now, hoss.

45:16.589 --> 45:17.749
You know what?

45:17.840 --> 45:20.377
Let's not even think about it, all right?

45:20.468 --> 45:22.083
Here's to new beginnings.

45:23.804 --> 45:26.090
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

45:26.182 --> 45:29.049
Mango-carrot fusion.
Here's to it.

45:29.143 --> 45:33.352
J Jamaica is my home j

45:33.439 --> 45:36.806
j oh, Jamaica is my home j

45:36.901 --> 45:38.562
- get it?
- Mm-hmm.

45:38.653 --> 45:41.110
- J Jamaica is my home j
- That's a small fish.

45:41.197 --> 45:42.758
I know, I thought
it would be a lot bigger.

45:42.782 --> 45:45.194
Sounds like you've been
enjoying yourself, mon.

45:45.284 --> 45:46.740
Yeah, mon.

45:46.827 --> 45:48.943
You gotta get yourself
3 nice Jamaican woman

45:49.038 --> 45:51.905
to make you some
of that good jerk chicken, man.

45:51.999 --> 45:53.910
Hey, anybody else
wanna go out for a swim?

45:54.001 --> 45:55.582
No, mon. Don't do it.

45:55.670 --> 45:59.003
The water's beautiful.
Why can't we jump in?

45:59.090 --> 46:02.207
What happens at hedonism
stays at hedonism.

46:02.301 --> 46:04.883
But the sea, she remembers, man.

46:07.723 --> 46:09.839
Few years back,
some of the more adventurous guests

46:09.934 --> 46:13.426
would have the hotel ferry them
out right to this spot here.

46:13.521 --> 46:15.887
They'd take the current
all the way back in,

46:15.982 --> 46:17.688
screwing the whole way.

46:17.775 --> 46:19.936
Called it riding the dolphin, man.

46:20.027 --> 46:22.234
What the hell are you talking about?

46:23.406 --> 46:26.273
That was before
the real dolphins joined in.

46:26.367 --> 46:30.701
Maybe it was the smell,
all them juices percolating in the water.

46:30.788 --> 46:35.407
First they followed them into the shore,
almost like they was protecting them, mon.

46:36.627 --> 46:42.293
Then one sunset, the dolphin jump up,
knocked the man right off his woman.

46:49.807 --> 46:52.344
Empty bikini washed up on shore, mon.

46:53.436 --> 46:56.394
Ever since, no fucking in the lagoon.

46:56.480 --> 46:59.142
And no swimming in this spot right here.

46:59.233 --> 47:01.519
- I'm not going swimming.
- I'm not going in.

47:03.571 --> 47:06.529
I'm fucking with you guys.

47:16.959 --> 47:18.950
Jj

47:21.005 --> 47:22.370
Why does...

47:22.465 --> 47:27.129
Why do people
always misinterpret who I actually am?

47:27.219 --> 47:30.006
I don't get it.
Everybody seems to like this guy.

47:30.097 --> 47:33.305
I don't get it. I'm just... it's over.

47:33.392 --> 47:35.553
Dolphins?

47:36.854 --> 47:39.687
Sherry, Sherry, tell us
some of your wild tales.

47:39.774 --> 47:41.376
All right, that's...
That's it, stop.

47:41.400 --> 47:45.018
I don't think we need to go there.
Maybe just another time?

47:45.112 --> 47:46.227
Chill out.

47:46.322 --> 47:47.937
Chill out, babe, come on.

47:48.032 --> 47:49.112
Oh.

47:53.621 --> 47:55.737
You ladies mind if I join?

47:55.831 --> 47:56.946
Yeah... no.

47:57.041 --> 47:58.702
No. No. Please.

47:59.710 --> 48:01.200
Please.

48:11.013 --> 48:14.176
Um, would you like, um, to...
To suck... I mean, blow...

48:14.266 --> 48:17.975
Um, do... do you want some?

48:18.062 --> 48:21.725
Ladies, ladies.

48:21.816 --> 48:24.182
- I don't bite.
- Really?

48:24.276 --> 48:26.141
Unless you want me to.

48:36.997 --> 48:38.362
- Fish up.
- Pull, pull it in.

48:38.457 --> 48:40.493
Got it. He's coming up.
He's coming up.

48:40.584 --> 48:42.979
- Pull it and get the hook, Tom.
- He's coming up. He's coming up.

48:43.003 --> 48:44.664
Get the gaff.

48:44.755 --> 48:46.191
Get the hook.
There we go. Keep coming.

48:46.215 --> 48:47.500
You got him. You got him.

48:47.591 --> 48:50.708
Coming up, coming up,
he's coming up.

48:50.803 --> 48:52.589
Grab him, somebody grab him.

48:52.680 --> 48:54.241
- Let me get a pole.
- Here, hold... hold my pole.

48:54.265 --> 48:55.534
- That's a bigger fish than you.
- Look at that.

48:55.558 --> 48:57.719
- Whoo.
- Yeah, baby. Look at that, Tom!

48:59.228 --> 49:01.139
Oh, he's in the water.

49:01.230 --> 49:03.186
- He's in the water.
- Oh, shit, man.

49:04.400 --> 49:06.311
- He's dolphin meat, man.
- Look, you got him.

49:11.323 --> 49:14.065
Ah, dolphin! Dolphin!

49:14.160 --> 49:17.744
- Oh, shit. I'll get him, mon.
- You get him! It's your boat.

49:17.830 --> 49:20.287
Dolphin!

49:23.377 --> 49:26.119
Something got my leg!
Something's touching my leg!

49:46.984 --> 49:49.896
Ayo, weary traveler.

49:52.948 --> 49:56.941
You care for some dark Jamaican rum?

49:57.036 --> 49:59.493
Don't mind if I do.

49:59.580 --> 50:01.696
I'll take a belt right out of the bottle.

50:01.790 --> 50:02.870
Okay. Yeah.

50:02.958 --> 50:05.540
Yeah, change my perspective a little.

50:07.546 --> 50:10.458
- Yeah.
- It's good. That's good.

50:16.972 --> 50:20.635
I'm Lance. What do you go by?

50:21.644 --> 50:23.976
Island man.

50:24.063 --> 50:25.553
Ain't got no name.

50:25.648 --> 50:28.640
You got this crafty boat here.

50:28.734 --> 50:32.147
Obviously. You can't be no island man
if you don't have a ship.

50:34.532 --> 50:38.616
Oh. Oh, I am still
thinking about that incredible massage.

50:38.702 --> 50:42.866
Oh... me too.

50:42.957 --> 50:45.118
Oh, the face he did.

50:47.169 --> 50:50.081
Can't remember the last time
manfred took me dancing.

50:50.172 --> 50:53.414
Wow. Wow.

50:53.509 --> 50:57.422
Wow. Oh, try this, Georgia.
It's really fun!

50:57.513 --> 51:00.880
You're like a cross
between a unicorn and a stork.

51:00.975 --> 51:03.591
- A stork.
- Georgia.

51:03.686 --> 51:05.267
Oh, oh, oh...

51:05.354 --> 51:06.414
- There you go.
- Are you okay?

51:06.438 --> 51:07.791
Oh, yeah.
Something just popped out.

51:07.815 --> 51:09.000
- Are you sure?
- No, it just popped out.

51:09.024 --> 51:10.514
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

51:10.609 --> 51:13.225
Then they eventually
had their own child,

51:13.320 --> 51:17.063
you know, their real kid.
Their biological child.

51:17.157 --> 51:20.069
And then they tried to get rid of you?

51:20.160 --> 51:24.403
No. She never made me feel less than,
she made me feel like her real brother.

51:24.498 --> 51:26.659
And you know what I did?
I acted like a jerk.

51:26.750 --> 51:28.866
I didn't even protect her
the way I should have.

51:29.878 --> 51:32.540
So like you were the one abandoning them?

51:33.549 --> 51:35.005
All right, look.

51:36.176 --> 51:38.258
Let's go and find your destiny.

51:38.345 --> 51:40.552
Oh, right now?

51:40.639 --> 51:41.845
All right. Let's do it.

51:43.058 --> 51:45.845
I'll have another old swig of that rum.

51:45.936 --> 51:47.676
Go ahead, son.

51:47.771 --> 51:49.636
Tell your tale to the ocean.

51:49.732 --> 51:52.815
They really never stopped loving me.

51:52.901 --> 51:54.437
It was more just me.

51:54.528 --> 51:58.237
It was what was going on inside of me,
and I was just insecure of it.

51:58.324 --> 52:01.361
I mean, I never even
did this with my old man.

52:01.452 --> 52:03.989
All right. I'll be your Poppy.

52:04.079 --> 52:07.617
Should I be nervous?
I can't quite see the bottom here, Poppy.

52:10.502 --> 52:13.414
Gentlemen,
I hope you had a great day at sea.

52:13.505 --> 52:15.585
- You ready for a party?
- I need to go to bed.

52:15.633 --> 52:17.248
I think I got way too much sun today.

52:17.343 --> 52:19.263
What the hell
are you talking about, Tom?

52:19.303 --> 52:22.064
I've been waiting this whole darn time
to get into some nasty trouble.

52:22.097 --> 52:23.462
All right. Fine. One drink.

52:53.962 --> 52:56.669
Let's take some shots and get fucked up.

53:10.020 --> 53:12.932
Welcome to the par-Ty.

53:48.851 --> 53:50.842
Jj

54:35.105 --> 54:39.064
I think I've died and gone to heaven.

54:39.151 --> 54:41.107
Oh! What have you done to yourself?

54:41.195 --> 54:42.731
I don't know, I pulled something.

54:42.821 --> 54:44.716
- Oh, god.
- Oh, and how did you pull that, miss?

54:44.740 --> 54:47.277
Well, it's either dancing
or looking at that beautiful man.

54:47.367 --> 54:49.574
Classic mud pie.

54:49.661 --> 54:51.598
Mud pie and cotton candy
are like Thelma and Louise.

54:51.622 --> 54:53.704
Most beautiful bride,
well, this is my stop.

54:53.791 --> 54:54.871
Goodnight, ladies.

54:54.958 --> 54:58.121
- That was fun.
- That was fun.

55:00.172 --> 55:03.084
Your father and I are so happy for you.

55:04.092 --> 55:06.253
Of course, we were very worried
about you for a while.

55:06.345 --> 55:07.755
I know.

55:07.846 --> 55:10.462
You know, I'm so excited, too.

55:10.557 --> 55:14.800
He really is the man of my dreams.

55:14.895 --> 55:16.556
Your father's the man of my...

55:20.442 --> 55:22.808
Mom?

55:22.903 --> 55:25.440
Did you...
Did you fall asleep with...

55:25.531 --> 55:27.772
- I'm right here. I'm right here.
- Your eyes open?

55:27.866 --> 55:30.482
- Again?
- I'm right here.

55:31.495 --> 55:32.735
I'm worried about you.

55:32.830 --> 55:35.412
It looked like you fell asleep
with your eyes open. Mom?

55:35.499 --> 55:36.739
Are you okay?

55:36.834 --> 55:38.620
I'll just...

55:53.433 --> 55:55.424
Tits, tits, tits...

55:55.519 --> 55:57.430
Tits, tits, tits, tits,
tits, tits...

55:57.521 --> 55:59.978
Sweet... tits, tits, tits, tits, tits,
tits, tits, tits

56:00.065 --> 56:00.895
swweeeetttt

56:00.983 --> 56:03.086
I can't stand these goddamn tourists.

56:03.110 --> 56:04.566
Did you hear...?

56:04.653 --> 56:06.268
No. What?

56:06.363 --> 56:08.854
I heard one of them blew the other one...

56:09.408 --> 56:11.945
His fiancé is gonna be pissed!

56:12.369 --> 56:15.782
Not as much as she will be
during the wedding.

56:16.206 --> 56:19.619
Yeah... if there's a wedding... haha.

56:19.710 --> 56:21.229
Tits, tits, tits, tits, tits...

56:21.253 --> 56:23.744
Nnnnn... dicks. Dicks. Dicks. Dicks.
Dicks...

56:23.839 --> 56:27.548
Biniggggg...
Dicks. Dicks. Dicks. Dicks. Dicks...

56:33.515 --> 56:35.426
I feel like shit.

56:38.145 --> 56:39.385
Oh, hey, sexy.

56:41.023 --> 56:42.729
You really went all out last night.

56:43.942 --> 56:45.273
Shit.

56:47.863 --> 56:49.069
Don't go.

56:51.283 --> 56:53.274
Jj

57:00.959 --> 57:02.745
Ricky!

57:02.836 --> 57:04.872
Ricky! Ricky!

57:07.716 --> 57:10.583
Yo, get up, man.
What the fuck happened last night?

57:11.678 --> 57:13.669
Hey, hey, what happened?

57:13.764 --> 57:15.675
- We took some pills.
- We took some pills?

57:15.766 --> 57:18.428
Yeah, I'm sorry.
We got fucked up, had some bananas.

57:18.518 --> 57:20.258
Fuck!

57:20.354 --> 57:21.474
What happened with the girl?

57:21.563 --> 57:24.521
I woke up in her room and...

57:24.608 --> 57:26.586
- Oh, shit. You fucked her.
- No, I didn't fuck her, okay?

57:26.610 --> 57:28.100
- Nice.
- No, that's not nice!

57:28.195 --> 57:30.436
Oh, this is a bachelor party well done.

57:30.530 --> 57:32.691
- No.
- Yes.

57:32.783 --> 57:35.320
Well, I had my pants on.
I had my shoes on. And...

57:35.410 --> 57:36.991
Oh, that doesn't mean anything.

57:37.079 --> 57:38.740
This is all your fault.

57:41.541 --> 57:43.497
Fuck!

57:43.585 --> 57:45.041
It was a good night.

57:45.128 --> 57:47.210
Let's do it again.

57:48.674 --> 57:52.667
Remember, every man is an island

57:52.761 --> 57:55.719
trying to find his way home.

57:55.806 --> 57:57.762
What did I drink?

57:57.849 --> 58:00.591
Time to go home.

58:02.020 --> 58:05.888
Have faith, and always follow the current,

58:05.983 --> 58:10.101
no matter how rough and tough
the seas may be.

58:17.828 --> 58:20.319
Now, go on and find your next adventure.

58:20.414 --> 58:24.953
Ow! Where the hell am 1?
I mean, was this guy real?

58:25.043 --> 58:27.659
But not that direction. Lord god!

58:27.754 --> 58:29.870
You're going the wrong way.

58:29.965 --> 58:32.047
Gosh, I'm so hung over.

58:32.134 --> 58:33.840
You were supposed
to look after him, Ricky.

58:33.927 --> 58:35.588
I did, I think.

58:39.307 --> 58:41.013
What did you guys do last night?

58:41.101 --> 58:43.467
We just passed out after the hot tub.

58:43.562 --> 58:46.395
I would love to pass out
in a hot tub with you.

58:46.481 --> 58:48.597
I would, I would, I would.

58:48.692 --> 58:51.058
Okay. For the last time, Ricky,

58:51.153 --> 58:54.862
there is no scenario in which
I will ever sleep with you.

58:54.948 --> 58:58.361
Not even... not even
if there was a nuclear holocaust

58:58.452 --> 59:00.238
and we were
the last people left on earth.

59:00.328 --> 59:03.991
Not even if I thought it would cure
cancer, ebola, and aids!

59:04.082 --> 59:07.870
Not even if it stopped people
from voting republican.

59:07.961 --> 59:09.397
I don't wanna get political with you.

59:09.421 --> 59:11.628
I just wanna have some sex
with you on the beach.

59:11.715 --> 59:13.751
Okay. Ignore them.

59:13.842 --> 59:16.083
What are we gonna do today?

59:16.178 --> 59:20.763
Uh, I think we should probably
just fall asleep on the beach and just...

59:20.849 --> 59:22.339
Hey, banana boy?

59:24.603 --> 59:25.934
I think he's talking about us.

59:26.021 --> 59:27.352
Yeah. I'm banana boy.

59:27.439 --> 59:29.100
Deep throat!

59:30.108 --> 59:32.394
Yep. That's me.

59:34.696 --> 59:36.632
- He's... he's talking to me.
- He's talking to Rick.

59:36.656 --> 59:38.817
This is one of Ricky's things.

59:38.909 --> 59:41.150
- I'm sorry.
- He's a banana...

59:41.244 --> 59:42.513
We... we should just get out of here

59:42.537 --> 59:44.744
- and go hiking around, or something.
- Yeah.

59:44.831 --> 59:46.116
- Bye, guys.
- Love you, bro.

59:46.208 --> 59:47.664
Bye.

59:51.254 --> 59:54.371
So? That was strange.

59:54.466 --> 59:57.424
What exactly did you two
get up to last night?

59:57.511 --> 01:00:00.969
We acted like true gentlemen
last night, if you must know.

01:00:01.973 --> 01:00:04.339
Okay. This was fun.

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:06.641
- See you soon.
- In hell.

01:00:06.728 --> 01:00:07.843
Miss you already.

01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:12.014
Oh, hello.

01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:15.693
We're here.
The... the... oh, the...

01:00:15.779 --> 01:00:18.987
What she's trying to say is we are here
to see the psychosexual kinesiologist,

01:00:19.074 --> 01:00:21.781
who also happens
to be a subdural neuromanipulator.

01:00:21.868 --> 01:00:24.530
She's actually a sex coach.

01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:27.533
Okay. Well, I just like to say
subdural neurologist

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:29.990
because it makes me feel smart.

01:00:32.129 --> 01:00:34.461
Could you go ahead and sign
these first for me, please?

01:00:34.548 --> 01:00:38.040
Oh, sure. Sure.

01:00:38.135 --> 01:00:41.548
Oh, oh, oh...

01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:43.174
I got it.

01:00:43.265 --> 01:00:44.425
Oh, you're all right.

01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:48.759
"Mindful sexuality." Uh-huh.

01:00:48.854 --> 01:00:52.563
"Water work. Love your leather.

01:00:52.649 --> 01:00:58.895
How to dom your inner sub,
candle play: Don't get burned."

01:00:58.989 --> 01:01:00.695
Sign me up for everything.

01:01:00.782 --> 01:01:03.990
Name.

01:01:04.077 --> 01:01:05.442
What address?

01:01:07.122 --> 01:01:08.783
All right.

01:01:11.418 --> 01:01:13.579
Uh, what's "safe word"?

01:01:26.558 --> 01:01:29.140
Whoo. Oh, that's refreshing.

01:01:29.227 --> 01:01:33.937
Oh. Howard Freeman, upper management
and dodc here at hedo il.

01:01:34.024 --> 01:01:37.266
I've been watching you very, very closely

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:40.352
since your arrival here, and...

01:01:40.447 --> 01:01:44.861
And I have to say,
you really have a nice way about you.

01:01:44.951 --> 01:01:47.784
You're light on your feet, agile,

01:01:47.871 --> 01:01:51.409
and I notice when you walk
into a room, just lights up.

01:01:51.499 --> 01:01:53.455
Thanks.

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:55.784
You ever done any professional dancing?

01:01:55.879 --> 01:01:58.791
No, I... I did a high school,
uh, sound of music.

01:01:58.882 --> 01:02:00.463
J the hills are alive I

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:02.916
I bet you gave old plummer
a run for his money, huh?

01:02:03.011 --> 01:02:05.923
Hey, speaking of plumbing,
how are your pipes doing, Tom?

01:02:06.014 --> 01:02:07.629
They're good.

01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:08.993
The dry-cleaning for your wedding,

01:02:09.017 --> 01:02:12.805
it's gonna be nothing short
of perfection and gratis.

01:02:12.896 --> 01:02:14.511
What's, uh, what's gratis?

01:02:14.606 --> 01:02:17.222
That means on the house, Tommy boy.

01:02:17.317 --> 01:02:19.729
I'll see you at the wedding.

01:02:21.655 --> 01:02:24.067
Who the hell was that?

01:02:29.871 --> 01:02:31.236
Hi.

01:02:35.126 --> 01:02:36.787
This is a double, right?

01:02:36.878 --> 01:02:38.743
- Lance, Lance.
- Oh, hi.

01:02:38.838 --> 01:02:40.794
Okay. So, something is going on.

01:02:40.882 --> 01:02:41.943
- The boys were acting...
- Yeah.

01:02:41.967 --> 01:02:43.444
So weird
at breakfast this morning.

01:02:43.468 --> 01:02:46.926
- Super suspicious.
- Something's going on.

01:02:47.013 --> 01:02:51.507
Something very, very odd
is happening around here.

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:54.343
People were walking past
and they were shouting things like,

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:57.099
"oh, banana blowjob,
cock cowboy," and "deep throat."

01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:59.101
And I think...

01:02:59.192 --> 01:03:03.060
Ricky gave Tom
a blowjob last night.

01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:08.156
Uh... okay.

01:03:08.243 --> 01:03:10.950
Well, that's absolutely
gonna devastate Laura.

01:03:11.037 --> 01:03:14.074
But nobody wants to listen
to old Lance. No.

01:03:14.165 --> 01:03:16.907
No one wants to listen to Lance.

01:03:17.002 --> 01:03:18.993
I've had an idea. All right.

01:03:19.087 --> 01:03:21.043
I'm gonna go.
I'm gonna fix this.

01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:23.234
I'm gonna figure it out.
And then I'm gonna come find you, okay?

01:03:23.258 --> 01:03:24.258
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:03:24.342 --> 01:03:25.627
Okay. Just call me in my room.

01:03:26.928 --> 01:03:29.044
So, you wanna go check out the nude pool?

01:03:30.056 --> 01:03:32.217
Ah, there's a nude pool.

01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:37.435
Strange winds are blowing around here.

01:03:45.071 --> 01:03:47.528
A perfect orgasm

01:03:47.615 --> 01:03:52.450
is a confluence of all five senses:

01:03:53.455 --> 01:03:54.991
Touch...

01:03:57.917 --> 01:03:59.157
Taste...

01:04:05.592 --> 01:04:06.877
Smell...

01:04:08.219 --> 01:04:09.880
Sound...

01:04:10.889 --> 01:04:12.550
And sight.

01:04:16.436 --> 01:04:20.395
And unroll to reveal your tools.

01:04:20.482 --> 01:04:24.566
We will focus on one sense at a time.

01:04:24.652 --> 01:04:27.689
Placing all of your tools...

01:04:33.578 --> 01:04:38.493
Let your hands and your bodies
express your sensations.

01:04:49.344 --> 01:04:51.756
Gentlemen.

01:04:51.846 --> 01:04:54.383
We are ready for you to enter us.

01:04:55.809 --> 01:05:00.348
You can do this. Yeah!
Yeah, you can.

01:05:02.065 --> 01:05:03.896
No, no, stop it.

01:05:03.983 --> 01:05:05.974
All right. Come on.

01:05:08.321 --> 01:05:10.277
God, I'm a good friend.

01:05:28.049 --> 01:05:29.710
Hey, Mr. Ricky.

01:05:32.011 --> 01:05:35.174
Do you wanna order
a cold drink for a thirsty girl?

01:05:35.265 --> 01:05:38.507
Yeah, I do.
A lot of tits and ass everywhere.

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:41.051
Hey, Ricky!

01:05:42.981 --> 01:05:44.221
Whoa!

01:05:45.692 --> 01:05:48.775
I knew you come around
for some of that Ricky dick.

01:05:48.862 --> 01:05:52.446
Let's go make a Ricky flick.
Come on.

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:57.192
Tantric sexual stimulation,

01:05:57.287 --> 01:06:00.029
it's about admitting a desire.

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:06.952
Share a desire.

01:06:19.267 --> 01:06:21.223
That's my finger.

01:06:21.311 --> 01:06:24.553
Share a fantasy
you've never admitted.

01:06:26.232 --> 01:06:27.517
Meow.

01:06:27.609 --> 01:06:31.522
Now, experience your sensations.

01:06:58.598 --> 01:07:00.839
- Huh?
- There's a beautiful girl, mon.

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:10.853
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
She's attractive all right.

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:15.612
Something about her.

01:07:17.075 --> 01:07:19.316
You should go talk to her, mon.

01:07:19.410 --> 01:07:22.447
Oh, uh, yeah.
Actually, we already met.

01:07:22.539 --> 01:07:25.155
She's, you know,
she's going through kind of a hard time.

01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:27.992
- She got left at the altar.
- Yeah, mon.

01:07:28.086 --> 01:07:29.667
- Yeah. Very sad.
- Broken heart, mon.

01:07:29.754 --> 01:07:30.960
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

01:07:31.047 --> 01:07:33.663
You should mend that heart
with big Janelle right there.

01:07:33.758 --> 01:07:36.465
Get an orgy going. I can watch.

01:07:36.553 --> 01:07:40.137
You take her to the romper room, mon,
and you tie her up like a goat.

01:07:40.223 --> 01:07:42.134
No. You're not hearing what I'm saying.

01:07:42.225 --> 01:07:44.807
She's a nice girl.
She just got left at the altar.

01:07:44.894 --> 01:07:46.497
She's going through kind of a rough time.

01:07:46.521 --> 01:07:49.558
If I were to say something to her,
it'd be like, I don't know.

01:07:49.649 --> 01:07:52.253
"Would you like to go for a walk
on the beach?" Something like that.

01:07:52.277 --> 01:07:53.879
- You see what I'm saying?
- Yeah, mon. Yeah, mon.

01:07:53.903 --> 01:07:58.693
- Yeah.
- She is a really pretty woman.

01:08:00.368 --> 01:08:02.859
It does seem like she's looking
over here, though.

01:08:02.954 --> 01:08:04.819
She's definitely
looking right at you, mon.

01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:07.280
- Hold the gaze.
- Yeah. You think so?

01:08:07.375 --> 01:08:09.616
She's almost as beautiful as my wife.

01:08:09.711 --> 01:08:11.702
- You're married?
- Yeah, mon.

01:08:11.796 --> 01:08:15.004
So, what are you doing
in this cabana right beside me?

01:08:16.676 --> 01:08:18.041
I was noticing your pants.

01:08:18.136 --> 01:08:19.671
They're, uh, really nice.

01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:22.575
- What kind of pants are those?
- Oh, you're not Jamaican? Where you from?

01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:26.433
I'm actually from long island.
But, uh, dual citizen, mon.

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:29.727
Uh... let me, uh...

01:08:29.814 --> 01:08:31.457
Let me press
these pants for you, for real.

01:08:31.482 --> 01:08:33.268
No, thank you.

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:37.272
By the way, my wife think
you look like Matt lauer, man.

01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:39.024
Oh, yeah?
Well, I don't know if you heard,

01:08:39.115 --> 01:08:41.777
he got into a little trouble
back in the states.

01:08:41.868 --> 01:08:44.609
Oh, no, mon.
She's gonna be devastated.

01:08:44.703 --> 01:08:45.738
Is he gonna be okay?

01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:49.072
Have you been here the whole time?

01:09:03.305 --> 01:09:07.595
All right. I think I hear
the waterfall right over here somewhere.

01:09:07.685 --> 01:09:10.596
All right. It's just right over here.

01:10:29.142 --> 01:10:30.382
So...

01:10:32.729 --> 01:10:34.720
You wanna just take our clothes off?

01:10:38.735 --> 01:10:40.726
Jj

01:10:49.036 --> 01:10:51.072
Are you okay?

01:10:51.164 --> 01:10:54.031
Georgia, what did you discover
about Tom and Ricky?

01:10:54.125 --> 01:10:55.740
- Uh...
- Did Ricky fellate Tom?

01:10:59.630 --> 01:11:06.047
So, uh, Ricky...
Ricky is, um, straight, yeah.

01:11:06.137 --> 01:11:08.173
Straight as an arrow for you, babe.

01:11:08.264 --> 01:11:12.177
And, you know,
he's a surprisingly, uh...

01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:16.307
Deep and, um, spiritual...
Philosophical individual.

01:11:16.397 --> 01:11:19.981
Very philosophical.
Um, Shakespeare once said...

01:11:20.067 --> 01:11:22.103
- Did you blow Tom?
- Uh...

01:11:22.195 --> 01:11:23.526
Why are you looking at her?

01:11:23.613 --> 01:11:26.275
Simple question;
Did you go down on him?

01:11:26.365 --> 01:11:29.653
I'm not sure what happened.
It was a big night out.

01:11:29.744 --> 01:11:33.612
We took some pills and Tom
woke up in some chick's room.

01:11:33.706 --> 01:11:35.225
- But it's all my fault.
- Okay.

01:11:35.249 --> 01:11:37.956
I'm gonna, uh, go grab a wet wipe.

01:11:40.379 --> 01:11:42.370
Jj

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:48.592
Okay. A guy as dumb as Tom

01:11:48.679 --> 01:11:51.762
has to leave a few clues
here and there.

01:11:51.849 --> 01:11:54.431
Jesus Christ.

01:11:54.519 --> 01:11:55.554
Just you, Lance.

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:09.105
Oh, gee.

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:24.332
Shit. Luckily, this is all inclusive.

01:12:39.897 --> 01:12:41.387
- Ooh.
- Oh.

01:12:41.482 --> 01:12:42.767
- Okay.
- Can you get it off?

01:12:42.859 --> 01:12:44.099
- Yup.
- Oh.

01:12:46.988 --> 01:12:47.988
Ooh!

01:13:03.671 --> 01:13:05.957
Dude, what the fuck, man? Shit.

01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:09.381
Don't you have any boundaries?

01:13:09.468 --> 01:13:10.958
Yeah, I got boundaries.

01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:15.968
I also got a couple of questions
for this guy right here, your fiancé.

01:13:16.058 --> 01:13:19.300
I just had a little chat
with your best man.

01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:21.727
- Yeah?
- Yeah, okay. Yeah.

01:13:21.814 --> 01:13:25.227
Look, Lance, Tom is a good guy.

01:13:25.318 --> 01:13:27.434
I love him and we're getting married,

01:13:27.528 --> 01:13:30.770
and you have to learn
how to just deal with it.

01:13:30.865 --> 01:13:32.696
Oh, you want me to deal with it?

01:13:32.783 --> 01:13:36.071
Let me tell you something about
this so-called "good guy," all right?

01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:41.326
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, no.

01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:43.829
Sit down! That's right, honey.

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:45.876
He fornicated with another girl.

01:13:45.963 --> 01:13:48.295
- What?
- Yeah. Tell her.

01:13:48.382 --> 01:13:51.749
- Explain it to her.
- What is he talking about, Tom?

01:13:51.844 --> 01:13:53.764
Yeah, what am I talking about, Tom?

01:13:53.804 --> 01:13:57.012
You know what?
I et me handle this one.

01:13:57.099 --> 01:14:00.216
My investigation so far
has yielded the information

01:14:00.311 --> 01:14:03.519
that, uh, there is a woman named Anna.

01:14:03.606 --> 01:14:07.269
Does that ring a bell, Tom,
if that's even your real name?

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:10.734
[-L-i... I don't...
I don't know... I don't... I don't...

01:14:10.821 --> 01:14:13.028
=I.

01:14:13.115 --> 01:14:14.509
What, is english your second language?

01:14:14.533 --> 01:14:15.818
- I... okay...
- Speak!

01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:18.151
- Okay.
- Just tell me what happened.

01:14:18.245 --> 01:14:21.328
I... I woke up in another
woman's room and I don't...

01:14:21.415 --> 01:14:22.976
- I don't think I did anything.
- Oh, oh, oh.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.456
You woke up in another woman's room?

01:14:24.543 --> 01:14:26.454
- Are you hearing this, honey?
- I... okay.

01:14:26.545 --> 01:14:29.708
I had... I had... I had no
shirt on but my shorts were on.

01:14:29.799 --> 01:14:31.026
- My shorts were on...
- His shirt was off

01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:32.881
but he thinks he had his underoos on.

01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:34.237
What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:14:34.261 --> 01:14:35.656
But my... my shoes was...
My shorts were on...

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:36.740
- She's furious.
- And my...

01:14:36.764 --> 01:14:38.284
My shoes were on and... and I don't...

01:14:38.349 --> 01:14:40.681
I wouldn't... I wouldn't do anything.
I know myself.

01:14:40.768 --> 01:14:42.474
He thinks that he had clothes on.

01:14:42.561 --> 01:14:43.892
Starting to see what I mean here?

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:46.141
L... dude, that's not...

01:14:46.232 --> 01:14:47.792
It's not what you think.
I didn't cheat.

01:14:47.858 --> 01:14:50.565
Go walk it off, sis.
I'm right behind you.

01:14:50.653 --> 01:14:54.066
You're disgusting. I agree
with what she said a hundred percent,

01:14:54.156 --> 01:14:55.692
and so far as I can tell,

01:14:55.783 --> 01:14:59.196
you're just one more guy
who cheats on his fiancée.

01:14:59.286 --> 01:15:02.244
And I think that that's just horrible.

01:15:03.541 --> 01:15:05.907
And this room's a goddamn pigsty.

01:15:10.715 --> 01:15:12.192
Mom, dad, I have to tell you something.

01:15:12.216 --> 01:15:14.502
Oh. What the...

01:15:16.595 --> 01:15:18.631
What the fuck?

01:15:18.723 --> 01:15:20.964
You must be the bride.
Congratulations.

01:15:21.058 --> 01:15:22.389
- Hi, honey.
- Mom?

01:15:49.503 --> 01:15:51.459
He had us all fooled.

01:15:51.547 --> 01:15:54.539
I got to admit,
you did seem pretty happy.

01:15:55.551 --> 01:15:59.920
And I'm sorry that I wasn't
more happy for you.

01:16:00.014 --> 01:16:04.132
Well, I didn't exactly always
make it easy for you to be happy for me.

01:16:04.226 --> 01:16:07.218
You don't have to say that.

01:16:08.522 --> 01:16:12.310
I'm just sorry that I never
really tried to understand you.

01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:15.108
Hey, to me, you were the only person

01:16:15.196 --> 01:16:19.405
that never really
did understand me, all right?

01:16:19.492 --> 01:16:24.953
And, well, I'm sorry I didn't
treat you like a real brother.

01:16:25.039 --> 01:16:28.577
Lance, you're better than any real brother
I could ever ask for.

01:16:29.585 --> 01:16:31.871
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:16:40.304 --> 01:16:42.115
- Please, just talk to me. Please.
- Don't talk to me.

01:16:42.139 --> 01:16:43.549
I can't even look at you.

01:16:43.641 --> 01:16:45.097
Excuse me. Is everything okay?

01:16:45.184 --> 01:16:46.944
No, I need a car to the airport.
I'm leaving.

01:16:47.019 --> 01:16:49.601
- What about your beautiful wedding?
- It's not happening.

01:16:49.688 --> 01:16:51.053
At this point, it's too late.

01:16:51.148 --> 01:16:53.981
There is no cabs, no flights out.

01:16:54.068 --> 01:16:55.979
Winston, she's got to fly out tonight.

01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:58.340
I'll get her a cab
and the first flight out in the morning.

01:16:58.364 --> 01:16:59.979
It's a great idea.

01:17:00.074 --> 01:17:02.736
Tonight, you either stay with Georgia
or you stay with myself.

01:17:02.827 --> 01:17:04.658
And buddy, your ticket's been punched.

01:17:04.745 --> 01:17:07.452
Laura, come this way.
Thank you, Winston.

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:13.576
You know, it would've been
such a wonderful wedding.

01:18:39.131 --> 01:18:42.498
- Morning, son.
- Morning, dad.

01:18:55.356 --> 01:18:58.644
I don't really know what to do.

01:18:58.734 --> 01:19:02.101
I thought it was
what you and mom have.

01:19:03.113 --> 01:19:07.106
Well, your mom and I have...
Discovered new things, too.

01:19:07.201 --> 01:19:12.696
We've been together a long time
and the flame starts to die a little bit,

01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:14.851
you know, not like that seven-year itch
kind of thing,

01:19:14.875 --> 01:19:17.537
but something a whole lot more.

01:19:19.255 --> 01:19:21.837
You know, so you try something.

01:19:21.924 --> 01:19:25.633
You don't think you're gonna
like it, but you do.

01:19:25.719 --> 01:19:28.426
So you try something else.

01:19:29.431 --> 01:19:32.798
You know, every time I see you
and Laura Jane together, I...

01:19:32.893 --> 01:19:36.477
I just think,
"boy, don't ever lose that."

01:19:40.192 --> 01:19:42.899
You think it's too late to fix this?

01:19:42.987 --> 01:19:46.696
Well, son, in the end, nothing's too late.

01:19:46.782 --> 01:19:49.740
Dad, what do I do?

01:19:49.827 --> 01:19:51.988
I can't tell you that, son.

01:19:52.079 --> 01:19:53.694
That's up to you to decide.

01:19:53.789 --> 01:19:57.077
Worst fucking day ever.

01:19:57.167 --> 01:19:59.909
Hey, man, can I get a couple,
um, a couple shots, just...

01:20:00.004 --> 01:20:02.620
Just line them up here,
and I'll take them.

01:20:14.935 --> 01:20:19.019
Tommy, you look ridiculous.

01:20:22.276 --> 01:20:25.018
So what? You fucked up.

01:20:25.112 --> 01:20:26.727
Now listen to me carefully.

01:20:26.822 --> 01:20:28.483
I have three words
of advice for you, kid.

01:20:28.574 --> 01:20:31.782
Chase your dreams, fulfill your destiny,
and go get a haircut.

01:20:31.869 --> 01:20:32.869
You look like a moron.

01:20:35.873 --> 01:20:37.909
Quit feeling sorry for yourself.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.288
Sober up, take a shower and go get her.

01:20:41.378 --> 01:20:45.337
And use deodorant. I'm a hallucination,
I can still smell you.

01:20:46.759 --> 01:20:48.841
Mr. Tom, hurry up, mon.

01:20:50.054 --> 01:20:51.419
She's a runaway, mon.

01:20:51.513 --> 01:20:52.753
All right, let's go, let's go.

01:20:52.848 --> 01:20:55.305
All right, Andy.
Rip these roads, mon.

01:20:55.392 --> 01:20:57.929
All right, let's go.
How long until we get there?

01:20:58.020 --> 01:20:59.760
- Two hours, mon.
- Fuck.

01:20:59.855 --> 01:21:01.391
He's cute.

01:21:01.482 --> 01:21:02.722
- He is hot.
- So wasted.

01:21:02.816 --> 01:21:04.522
I couldn't even take his shoes off.

01:21:04.610 --> 01:21:05.754
- That's how loyal he is.
- Wow.

01:21:05.778 --> 01:21:07.564
Oh. Who's Laura, anyways?

01:21:07.654 --> 01:21:09.770
I don't know. I don't care.

01:21:09.865 --> 01:21:11.480
- Oh, man.
- I just love him.

01:21:11.575 --> 01:21:14.157
- Laura, I need to throw up.
- It's a shame.

01:21:14.244 --> 01:21:16.610
- Laura.
- He loved his fucking girlfriend.

01:21:16.705 --> 01:21:20.323
- Who's Laura?
- Oh, fuck!

01:21:20.417 --> 01:21:21.702
- Laura.
- \who's that?

01:21:21.794 --> 01:21:23.000
All right, thanks, guys.

01:21:23.087 --> 01:21:24.623
All right, Tom.

01:21:24.713 --> 01:21:26.624
Make sure you tell her
that you love her

01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:29.422
and that she's
the only woman in the world,

01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:33.048
and you take her to the romper room
and you tie her up like a goat.

01:21:34.056 --> 01:21:35.466
All right. Thanks. Yeah.

01:21:44.858 --> 01:21:46.769
- Hello?
- Laura?

01:21:47.778 --> 01:21:50.269
- Georgia?
- I have something to tell you.

01:21:50.364 --> 01:21:51.524
Laura, can you hear me?

01:21:51.615 --> 01:21:53.815
- I can't... I can't hear you.
- Laura, he didn't do it.

01:21:55.953 --> 01:21:57.944
Jj

01:22:05.087 --> 01:22:06.543
I really... l really messed up,

01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:08.746
and I can't stop
thinking about you and I was...

01:22:08.841 --> 01:22:10.985
I was... I was running around
the hotel looking for you and...

01:22:11.009 --> 01:22:14.046
Stop. I know you would
never do anything to hurt me.

01:22:14.138 --> 01:22:15.924
This weekend has been...
It's been crazy,

01:22:16.014 --> 01:22:19.677
and with, you know, the family and...

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:21.304
I can't imagine my life without you.

01:22:21.395 --> 01:22:24.355
- I just-l just had... had to tell you.
- Can you just shut up and kiss me?

01:24:00.452 --> 01:24:03.034
Hey, uh, Mr. manfred, sir.

01:24:03.121 --> 01:24:05.237
- Mr. manfred, sir?
- Oh, my god.

01:24:05.332 --> 01:24:07.539
I'm sorry.
This isn't a bad time, is it?

01:24:07.626 --> 01:24:09.729
I was hoping I could maybe talk to you
about that business proposal.

01:24:09.753 --> 01:24:11.914
Do you have a few minutes to talk?

01:24:16.718 --> 01:24:18.174
How much?

01:24:20.264 --> 01:24:23.131
Uh, I'm sorry. I don't...

01:24:23.225 --> 01:24:25.557
How much?

01:24:25.644 --> 01:24:30.138
How much for you to leave me
and my family alone

01:24:30.232 --> 01:24:31.847
for the rest of our lives?

01:24:38.282 --> 01:24:39.362
Five hundred?

01:24:42.035 --> 01:24:43.400
Half million dollars?

01:24:43.495 --> 01:24:45.861
Oh, no, no. No, no, no.
Not a half million dollars,

01:24:45.956 --> 01:24:48.413
like, I was thinking $500.

01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:50.616
L... I... I already got 1,500 saved up

01:24:50.711 --> 01:24:53.703
so that would put me at 2,000
which should be a nice nest egg

01:24:53.797 --> 01:24:55.567
to open a little dry cleaner
right here on the island.

01:24:55.591 --> 01:24:58.799
Who do I make that out to?

01:25:00.095 --> 01:25:01.926
Ira Goldstein, sir.

01:25:05.225 --> 01:25:06.761
Good job.

01:25:06.852 --> 01:25:08.092
Good doing business with you.

01:25:09.730 --> 01:25:14.144
On second thought,
would you maybe, uh, pay me in cash?

01:25:14.234 --> 01:25:17.567
Check's totally fine.
Don't even worry about it.

01:25:18.572 --> 01:25:20.528
Thanks, Mr. manfred.

01:25:24.453 --> 01:25:27.866
Uh, first off, I've been
down here a couple of days now,

01:25:27.956 --> 01:25:30.538
and I've gotten the chance
to know both families

01:25:30.626 --> 01:25:32.992
and talk to a lot of people
about Tom here,

01:25:33.086 --> 01:25:37.580
and I've heard what a charming,
kind, smart fella he is.

01:25:37.674 --> 01:25:39.756
And, uh, I'm the luckiest guy
in the world,

01:25:39.843 --> 01:25:43.006
because he's gonna take care
of my baby sister, which is great.

01:25:43.096 --> 01:25:45.462
And I wouldn't have it any other way.
Thank you.

01:25:47.601 --> 01:25:50.559
- Great job, Tommy. I'm proud of you.
- Well, we did it, didn't we folks?

01:25:50.646 --> 01:25:52.056
Huh?

01:25:52.147 --> 01:25:53.512
Yeah.

01:25:53.607 --> 01:25:57.350
I don't think that any of us
thought that we would end up here.

01:25:57.444 --> 01:26:00.732
Two great, very different families.

01:26:00.822 --> 01:26:03.188
Laura Jane, I am honored
to call you my daughter.

01:26:03.283 --> 01:26:06.696
Um, if I... if I could just take
one more second

01:26:06.787 --> 01:26:08.869
to say something
to my beautiful wife, Sherry.

01:26:08.955 --> 01:26:12.288
For so many years I have been
obsessed with my work.

01:26:12.376 --> 01:26:17.336
But I've realized that... the only
thing that matters is you.

01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:22.461
But the one thing I hope these kids learn

01:26:22.552 --> 01:26:28.172
is that it doesn't matter
where you are or when it is.

01:26:29.184 --> 01:26:33.177
But if you have the person you love

01:26:33.271 --> 01:26:36.354
standing next to you by your side...

01:26:36.441 --> 01:26:39.228
You're in the right place
at the right time.

01:26:43.573 --> 01:26:45.234
And if you have that,

01:26:45.325 --> 01:26:49.739
you will have something that will see you
through a whole host of hard times,

01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:52.287
which include, but are not limited to,

01:26:52.374 --> 01:26:55.582
the occasional dalliance,
premature ejaculation,

01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:58.752
no ejaculation, hemorrhoids,

01:26:58.839 --> 01:27:01.455
that thing they do
where they grind their teeth,

01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:06.044
insomnia, loose teeth,
failing vision, halitosis.

01:27:06.138 --> 01:27:07.628
Menopause.

01:27:09.391 --> 01:27:11.507
I can't wait to spend
the rest of my life with you.

01:27:14.521 --> 01:27:17.809
Give it, boy. Give it. Go.

01:28:25.967 --> 01:28:27.878
There's a...

01:28:27.969 --> 01:28:29.800
There's a... you got a dolphin...

01:28:31.348 --> 01:28:34.055
Hey! Hey!
Look! Look to your left!

01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:37.384
To your left! No, I'm not
waving to you. No!

01:29:05.799 --> 01:29:06.834
Retreat.

01:29:09.302 --> 01:29:11.258
We'll be back.

01:29:25.026 --> 01:29:26.186
I'm great.

01:29:27.195 --> 01:29:28.856
You saved my life.

01:29:28.947 --> 01:29:32.155
If you can believe it,
I'm terrified of the water.

01:29:32.242 --> 01:29:33.948
At least I used to be.

01:29:34.035 --> 01:29:36.196
You're my hero.

01:29:36.288 --> 01:29:37.824
I'm not a hero.

01:29:37.914 --> 01:29:39.825
I'm just Lance.

01:29:39.916 --> 01:29:42.749
Lance, kiss me, you fool.

01:29:45.547 --> 01:29:47.538
Tits, tits, tits...

01:29:47.632 --> 01:29:52.501
Tits, tits, tits, tits,
tits, tits...

01:29:52.596 --> 01:30:00.560
Sweet... tits, tits, tits, tits,
tits, tits, tits,

01:30:00.645 --> 01:30:02.601
jj

01:31:12.717 --> 01:31:15.675
The director is losing it
in the background.

01:31:39.828 --> 01:31:41.764
Just because
you don't know where you are,

01:31:41.788 --> 01:31:43.619
doesn't mean you're lost, Lance.

01:31:43.707 --> 01:31:45.347
It sounds like something Poppy would say.

01:31:45.417 --> 01:31:47.453
I guess it all worked out for the best.

01:31:47.544 --> 01:31:50.377
That being said, where the hell am I?

01:31:53.216 --> 01:31:55.047
We are about to have our sixth kid.

01:31:55.135 --> 01:31:58.002
And Mr. manfred, sir,
we're gonna name that kid after you,

01:31:58.096 --> 01:32:00.178
and I don't care
if it's a boy or a girl.

01:32:13.278 --> 01:32:14.278
Take me.

01:32:30.587 --> 01:32:34.171
But you see, that's an area I actually
don't have a complaint about.

01:32:34.257 --> 01:32:39.627
Papa, although he looks
large and heavy...

01:32:40.805 --> 01:32:43.262
Is large and heavy.

01:32:49.481 --> 01:32:51.517
I'd like to dedicate a song

01:32:51.608 --> 01:32:54.145
to all the girls that slept with Ricky.

01:32:55.779 --> 01:32:58.361
Uh, uh, uh...

01:32:58.448 --> 01:32:59.528
Come back.

01:32:59.616 --> 01:33:01.106
