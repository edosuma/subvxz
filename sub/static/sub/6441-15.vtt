01:46.406 --> 01:49.000
Very lucky tonight.

02:12.699 --> 02:14.189
Sorry, Dirk.

03:17.564 --> 03:20.465
- Come on!
- Who the hell are you?

03:21.734 --> 03:23.929
Lucas, I'm your brother.

03:25.772 --> 03:27.467
Well, come on!

04:38.644 --> 04:41.204
Sure is peaceful in here
this early in the morning.

04:41.380 --> 04:43.405
I never took you to be a coffee junkie...

04:43.582 --> 04:46.642
...but I have the first pot brewing,
if you want to wait a sec.

04:46.852 --> 04:49.116
Anything else I can get you?

04:51.257 --> 04:53.157
Just a job.

04:56.295 --> 04:57.819
Here?

04:58.063 --> 05:00.759
If I'm gonna work,
why not do it where my friends are?

05:00.933 --> 05:02.491
Don't take this the wrong way...

05:02.668 --> 05:06.729
...but you don't have the best track record
when it comes to keeping appointments.

05:09.041 --> 05:12.704
But talk to Hank, I hear they're hiring
over at the hardware store.

05:12.878 --> 05:14.539
Ouch.

05:14.980 --> 05:16.641
Guess that was kind of harsh.

05:23.589 --> 05:27.081
I can put you in the running
with the other applicants.

05:32.231 --> 05:34.859
No, no, no,
it's a very important vote tomorrow.

05:35.034 --> 05:37.764
I'm not moving the day
to accommodate Dobkin's fetish...

05:37.937 --> 05:39.370
...for antique clocks.

05:39.538 --> 05:45.238
I want him back from Prague now,
Steven, do you understand me?

05:45.578 --> 05:47.375
Hello, Dad.

05:47.613 --> 05:49.103
Lex.

05:49.815 --> 05:53.114
To what do I owe the pleasure
of this unexpected visit?

05:53.586 --> 05:56.521
I thought you might be interested
in meeting your youngest heir.

05:56.689 --> 05:59.624
Lucas, this is your father.

05:59.792 --> 06:01.555
Mr. Luthor.

06:03.829 --> 06:05.319
Lucas.

06:06.732 --> 06:08.222
Lucas.

06:12.371 --> 06:13.633
Son.

06:13.806 --> 06:16.673
At least biologically speaking, right?

06:18.477 --> 06:22.743
I see we both share a passion
for Asian weaponry.

06:23.649 --> 06:27.710
By the placement of the dragon,
it must be worn on the right hip.

06:27.887 --> 06:30.412
A rare left-handed sword.

06:32.858 --> 06:34.758
But it's a fake.

06:35.794 --> 06:38.319
That's a very keen observation.

06:38.497 --> 06:40.692
Especially from someone
you told me was dead.

06:42.134 --> 06:47.333
Imagine my surprise to learn that Lucas
was alive and well, living in Edge City.

06:47.506 --> 06:50.805
Come on, Dad.
You knew he was alive.

06:52.711 --> 06:54.201
Lucas?

07:00.653 --> 07:04.851
My chef will fix you anything
your heart desires.

07:09.628 --> 07:12.825
Don't talk about me behind my back.

07:18.737 --> 07:20.728
So the prodigal son returns.

07:20.906 --> 07:23.932
But unlike his envious brother
in the gospel...

07:24.109 --> 07:28.478
...it looks like you have welcomed Lucas
with open arms.

07:28.647 --> 07:31.138
What do you expect to get out of it, Lex?

07:31.317 --> 07:32.716
Just a new brother.

07:32.885 --> 07:36.343
One who's just turned 18,
if I remember correctly...

07:36.522 --> 07:39.889
...and is now entitled
to claim his inheritance.

07:40.492 --> 07:43.222
It was generous of you
to set up your living trust...

07:43.395 --> 07:46.660
...so heirs automatically get
10 percent of your LuthorCorp shares.

07:46.832 --> 07:49.858
It's the vital 10 percent you need
to vote me out of power.

07:52.538 --> 07:56.770
Is that why half my board
has suddenly found a myriad excuses...

07:56.942 --> 08:01.743
...for not taking my calls?
Oh, my word, you're staging a coup.

08:07.553 --> 08:09.043
Careful, Lex...

08:09.221 --> 08:13.885
...there are parables of many kinds
to be found in the Good Book.

08:15.160 --> 08:16.650
Selma...

08:17.296 --> 08:18.991
...get me my next call, please.

08:25.537 --> 08:28.506
Working at the Talon.
Could you be any more obvious?

08:28.674 --> 08:31.040
What happened to the Pete Ross rule
of proximity?

08:31.210 --> 08:34.179
You wanna get in the game,
you gotta get on the court.

08:34.346 --> 08:36.211
Clark, Lana will be your boss.

08:36.381 --> 08:40.182
She's gonna take out her frustrations
for all the times you've ever let her down.

08:40.352 --> 08:43.844
You won't be in the game. You'll be
in the locker room cleaning the toilets.

08:46.191 --> 08:48.887
I'm probably not gonna
get the job anyway.

08:51.530 --> 08:52.827
Guys...

08:52.998 --> 08:55.262
...I want you to meet somebody.

08:55.534 --> 08:59.061
This is Lucas. My brother.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.840
What's up, guys?

09:03.442 --> 09:07.037
- Lucas, you wanna shoot some hoops?
- Yeah, sure.

09:08.480 --> 09:09.708
- Here you go.
- Come on.

09:09.882 --> 09:11.372
All right.

09:13.052 --> 09:15.885
Didn't mean to drop a bombshell on you.

09:16.221 --> 09:19.156
I thought he was supposed to be,
well, dead.

09:19.324 --> 09:20.723
Just buried by my father.

09:20.893 --> 09:23.487
I've been looking for him
for several months.

09:24.329 --> 09:25.956
Why didn't you say something?

09:26.398 --> 09:28.923
Because I wasn't sure
what I was gonna find.

09:34.373 --> 09:38.139
I've gotta straighten something out with
the bank. Lucas, we have to get going.

09:38.310 --> 09:40.471
Hey, you can hang out here if you want.

09:40.646 --> 09:43.012
Give me a chance to get to know him
a little bit.

09:43.182 --> 09:44.979
Yeah, sure, absolutely.

09:45.818 --> 09:47.479
I'll be back in an hour.

09:48.320 --> 09:49.981
Here you go, Pete.

09:53.092 --> 09:55.151
So you and Lex seem close.

09:56.128 --> 09:59.325
What, are you kidding?
They're like brothers.

10:03.735 --> 10:05.930
So, Lucas, where'd you grow up?

10:07.206 --> 10:08.901
All over.

10:09.141 --> 10:11.905
Must be kind of weird
not knowing your mom or your dad.

10:12.077 --> 10:15.410
Not really. Parents always try
to make you versions of themselves.

10:15.581 --> 10:18.607
Grow up without those constraints,
you can become your own person.

10:18.784 --> 10:21.480
It's an interesting theory.
I don't think I buy it, though.

10:21.653 --> 10:24.178
All right. Let's...

10:24.356 --> 10:26.847
Let's take you and Lex, for example.

10:27.459 --> 10:30.189
If he was raised by your parents
and you by Lionel...

10:30.362 --> 10:32.694
...you wouldn't grow up
to be different people?

10:32.865 --> 10:36.062
Trust me. You'd be rich and miserable
and he'd be wearing flannel.

10:36.235 --> 10:38.203
But if you were left alone, abandoned...

10:39.037 --> 10:41.369
...how do you think you'd turn out?
- I'm not sure.

10:41.840 --> 10:44.502
That's when you find out
what you're really made of.

10:45.244 --> 10:48.509
We gonna stand around and chitchat,
or are we gonna play some ball?

10:48.680 --> 10:50.147
Clark, let's see what you got.

10:53.852 --> 10:55.615
Check it up.

11:05.564 --> 11:07.429
Is that all you got, Clark?

11:08.000 --> 11:09.900
Be cool, man.

11:50.709 --> 11:54.167
Hey, Rocket Man,
we don't want anybody to get hurt.

11:55.247 --> 11:56.578
- All right.
- All right.

11:56.748 --> 11:57.976
Come on.

12:13.065 --> 12:16.432
Sorry, man, no hard feelings, right?
It's just a game.

12:17.603 --> 12:19.093
Right.

12:20.505 --> 12:23.497
Felt like you had a steel plate
in there or something.

12:23.675 --> 12:27.304
- Any chance I can get a ride back?
- Yeah, I'll give you a lift.

12:35.921 --> 12:37.354
Hello, Lana.

12:37.522 --> 12:39.956
- Hey. Almond mocha with extra whip?
- Yeah.

12:40.125 --> 12:45.427
And can you add an extra jolt of caffeine?
I'm in my postlunch-predeadline coma.

12:45.597 --> 12:47.326
Thank you.

12:48.567 --> 12:52.094
Katrina, could you get me an almond latte,
please, with extra whip?

12:54.206 --> 12:56.800
- Clark Kent applied for part-time?
- Yeah.

12:56.975 --> 12:59.739
And he didn't put me as a reference.
What's up with that?

12:59.911 --> 13:02.709
- Doesn't matter, I'm not gonna hire him.
- Why not?

13:02.881 --> 13:06.681
You work with him at the Torch,
isn't it strange supervising your friend?

13:06.852 --> 13:10.788
Are you kidding? Bossing around Clark
is the highlight of my day.

13:10.956 --> 13:14.915
Besides, he always comes through,
even if it is in his own special Clark time.

13:15.093 --> 13:17.653
Yeah, that's kind of what
I'm worried about.

13:17.963 --> 13:20.830
Lana, you and I both know
that Clark can do this job.

13:20.999 --> 13:23.126
What's the real reason
you don't want him here?

13:23.302 --> 13:24.530
I...

13:27.406 --> 13:29.636
Yeah, that's what I thought.

13:34.112 --> 13:36.342
I just spent the last two hours
at the bank.

13:36.515 --> 13:39.006
Any idea why my accounts
would be frozen?

13:39.184 --> 13:43.245
You know, Lex, I'm tired
of your constant attempts at mutiny.

13:43.422 --> 13:46.323
You didn't leave me too many options.
It was that or the plank.

13:46.491 --> 13:50.291
It wasn't wise of you, son,
to wager all of your assets as collateral...

13:50.462 --> 13:53.090
...against LexCorp
when you took out your loan.

13:53.265 --> 13:57.463
You see, now that your company
is a LuthorCorp property...

13:57.636 --> 14:00.696
...everything you own belongs to me.

14:01.773 --> 14:03.798
I want you out of the mansion.

14:05.177 --> 14:09.113
Come on, Dad, isn't this a little futile?

14:09.648 --> 14:12.776
Lucas and I will be back home
after we vote you out.

14:14.453 --> 14:16.683
Don't be so sure about that, Lex.

14:17.856 --> 14:21.622
Lucas and I had a very interesting
father and son chat.

14:21.793 --> 14:23.818
Long overdue.

14:23.995 --> 14:27.396
It'd be hard for you to imagine, Lex...

14:27.766 --> 14:30.929
...but some sons don't ever question
their allegiance to family.

14:32.938 --> 14:36.999
You're being incredibly naive
if you think you can trust him.

14:37.175 --> 14:41.009
Something you pick up at the tables, Lex.
You size up your options.

14:41.646 --> 14:44.843
You never know when you might
have to change your strategy midhand.

14:46.885 --> 14:50.116
Well, Lex, looks like you lose.

14:58.630 --> 15:00.291
I'll get it.

15:04.603 --> 15:06.696
- Hey, Lex.
- Clark, I'm sorry to bother you.

15:07.072 --> 15:09.597
- No problem. Is everything all right?
- No, it's not.

15:10.008 --> 15:12.203
Lex, what is it?

15:13.478 --> 15:17.915
According to my father,
I'm no longer a Luthor.

15:18.083 --> 15:21.382
He's left me with nothing,
not even a place to live.

15:22.654 --> 15:25.452
So I was wondering...

15:26.525 --> 15:28.254
...if...

15:28.894 --> 15:30.885
...I could stay with you for a while?

15:54.551 --> 15:57.952
- You're up early, even for you.
- I couldn't sleep.

15:58.121 --> 16:00.919
Does that have anything to do
with our new houseguest?

16:01.090 --> 16:03.888
- Can you blame me?
- We can't turn our backs on Lex now.

16:04.060 --> 16:07.223
Believe me, I have no intention
of turning my back on Lex now.

16:07.864 --> 16:09.525
- Morning.
- Good morning.

16:09.699 --> 16:12.793
- Anyone seen Lex?
- Yeah, he's out in the barn.

16:14.237 --> 16:18.230
He got up at the crack of dawn and insisted
on doing some chores to earn his keep.

16:18.408 --> 16:20.467
You got him mucking out
the stalls already?

16:20.643 --> 16:22.008
Yes.

16:22.912 --> 16:24.607
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

16:24.781 --> 16:26.214
Yeah. Hey, son.

16:26.382 --> 16:30.318
All kidding aside, I don't want you to forget
that he did investigate you for a year.

16:30.487 --> 16:33.081
Remember what's in the storm cellar?

16:33.256 --> 16:35.281
- Dad, I trust Lex.
- Clark...

16:35.458 --> 16:38.655
...I don't want him left alone on this farm.

16:49.305 --> 16:51.330
Well, I was gonna give you some tips...

16:51.508 --> 16:54.272
...but it looks like you have everything
under control.

16:55.011 --> 16:57.445
My family had a ranch in Montana.

16:57.614 --> 17:00.412
I used to go there in the summer
with my mom.

17:00.583 --> 17:01.811
Sounds like fun.

17:03.052 --> 17:05.953
We would work right alongside
the ranch hands.

17:06.122 --> 17:08.420
Everyone did their fair share.

17:08.590 --> 17:11.617
It was the only time I felt... normal.

17:11.794 --> 17:13.454
Did you ever go back?

17:15.298 --> 17:17.925
After my mother died,
my father sold the property.

17:19.402 --> 17:24.135
I guess you could say
he was never a man of the people.

17:24.941 --> 17:26.499
Let me give you a hand with that.

17:26.675 --> 17:29.702
Thanks, but I'd like to prove to your father
once and for all...

17:29.879 --> 17:33.508
...that some Luthors pull their own weight.

17:44.027 --> 17:45.585
Lucas?

17:48.598 --> 17:50.293
We've got to talk.

17:52.235 --> 17:53.532
Sure, Dad, what's up?

17:53.703 --> 17:58.037
What's up is that you have yet to sign over
your shares to me as we'd agreed.

17:58.207 --> 18:00.266
Please, turn that off.

18:01.811 --> 18:05.178
Lucas, please, turn that off. Now!

18:06.950 --> 18:10.511
Let's see, what's wrong
with this picture?

18:10.687 --> 18:14.088
I trick Lex, I play along with your
little game, and you offer me, what...

18:14.257 --> 18:16.452
...10 million dollars to walk away?

18:17.460 --> 18:20.759
I'd say it's a little more lucrative
than your card scams.

18:21.998 --> 18:26.059
Well, Dad, the deal sounded
really good at the time...

18:26.235 --> 18:30.433
...but that is until I realized
what a Luthor goes for these days.

18:30.607 --> 18:33.007
You see, I went through
the LuthorCorp financials...

18:33.176 --> 18:36.202
...and it turns out I'm worth five times
what you're offering me.

18:36.379 --> 18:40.042
And that only takes into account
what you report to Uncle Sam.

18:40.950 --> 18:44.818
Don't be getting delusions of grandeur,
my boy.

18:45.154 --> 18:47.554
- Tell me something, Dad.
- What?

18:47.724 --> 18:50.693
Why didn't you try and find me
before I was 12?

18:53.096 --> 18:58.227
Because your mother lied to me.
She told me you'd died as a baby.

18:58.401 --> 19:00.062
But I'm still not worth your time.

19:00.236 --> 19:03.933
I took care of you the best way
I knew how, Lucas.

19:05.108 --> 19:10.102
- At arm's length with a checkbook.
- There are worse scenarios.

19:11.314 --> 19:12.804
Lucas...

19:13.016 --> 19:18.283
...now it's your turn to live up
to our agreement.

19:19.322 --> 19:21.950
Please. Just sign.

19:22.258 --> 19:24.419
Please, son.

19:27.296 --> 19:28.786
Okay.

19:29.098 --> 19:30.861
Okay, Dad.

19:40.143 --> 19:43.408
You might want to have your lawyers
look over that.

19:47.250 --> 19:52.950
No, I trust that everything is in order.

19:58.227 --> 19:59.717
Dad.

20:00.563 --> 20:02.087
Lucas?

20:06.269 --> 20:08.737
What the hell are you doing?
You could have killed me.

20:08.905 --> 20:11.601
We both know you saw that ball coming.

20:12.008 --> 20:15.500
- You're way out of line, son.
- When blind man pours a drink...

20:15.678 --> 20:19.011
...he holds his finger on the inside rim
to feel when the glass is full.

20:19.182 --> 20:21.275
Yesterday, you didn't do that.

20:22.685 --> 20:27.782
And just now, you couldn't hide
your reaction to my lack of signature.

20:33.796 --> 20:35.923
What do you want, Lucas?

20:36.933 --> 20:38.833
Lex is the past...

20:39.001 --> 20:40.992
...I'm the future.

20:49.479 --> 20:51.709
Lana, I got your message.
What's up?

20:51.881 --> 20:55.180
Oh, I just wanted to let you know
that I filled that position.

20:55.785 --> 20:57.150
Great.

20:57.320 --> 21:00.619
- You didn't have to consult me about it.
- Yeah, I did.

21:00.790 --> 21:04.021
Congratulations, Clark, you got the job.

21:04.193 --> 21:05.683
Really?

21:05.995 --> 21:07.223
What changed your mind?

21:07.396 --> 21:10.763
A glowing recommendation
from the editor of the Torch.

21:11.234 --> 21:14.294
- So the job's yours, if you still want it.
- Of course.

21:14.470 --> 21:15.903
Are you sure about this?

21:16.072 --> 21:20.099
No. But I remember Lex believed in me
when I wanted to start this place.

21:20.276 --> 21:23.905
We all need someone to take a chance
on us. So when can you start?

21:24.080 --> 21:26.480
Don't you think you should check
with the boss first?

21:28.651 --> 21:31.620
Lana, this is Lucas, Lex's brother.

21:33.756 --> 21:38.284
- Lex never mentioned he had a brother.
- I wasn't exactly on his Christmas card list.

21:38.961 --> 21:42.488
I like the whole Egyptian/ Assyrian vibe.

21:42.732 --> 21:45.496
It's clear you put a lot of time
and effort into this place.

21:45.668 --> 21:47.329
Yeah, so did Lex.

21:47.770 --> 21:48.998
Well, Lex, is...

21:49.172 --> 21:51.766
He's not exactly in the picture anymore.

21:51.974 --> 21:53.737
Lionel threw Lex out of the mansion.

21:54.010 --> 21:55.807
How's he doing down on the farm, Clark?

21:55.978 --> 21:57.536
He's doing great.

21:57.713 --> 22:01.080
- He's a survivor.
- I hope that he can survive on nothing...

22:01.250 --> 22:04.811
...because anything that was his
is now mine.

22:04.987 --> 22:06.978
Including this place.

22:09.258 --> 22:12.159
You should know that Lex wasn't my boss,
he was my partner.

22:13.229 --> 22:14.890
Even better.

22:32.682 --> 22:37.449
- Hey. I didn't know the Talon delivered.
- I decided to make an exception.

22:37.620 --> 22:39.110
I assume you got the job, then.

22:39.288 --> 22:42.519
Apparently, the editor of the Torch
put me over the top.

22:42.825 --> 22:44.986
So how does it feel
to be a minimum-wage earner?

22:45.161 --> 22:46.389
Great.

22:46.562 --> 22:49.360
Though there seems to be some
personnel changes at the Talon.

22:49.532 --> 22:51.796
Are you talking about Lucas Luthor?

22:52.235 --> 22:53.759
Yeah, how'd you know?

22:53.936 --> 22:56.234
Are you kidding?
The prodigal Luthor son returns.

22:56.405 --> 22:59.340
And to top it all off,
the new heir has taken over the castle.

22:59.508 --> 23:03.444
That's a story that could land you a byline
on the front page of the Daily Planet.

23:03.613 --> 23:06.946
I just... I don't trust Lucas.
I think he's hiding something.

23:07.116 --> 23:09.846
Come on. Cut the guy a break.
He's had a really tough life.

23:10.019 --> 23:12.988
He bounced from foster home
to foster home. He never got adopted.

23:13.155 --> 23:16.613
When you were looking at his past,
you didn't find anything weird at all?

23:16.792 --> 23:18.692
Just the source.

23:24.133 --> 23:26.397
"Metropolis United Charities."

23:26.569 --> 23:30.562
Chloe said Lucas' file didn't even exist
two weeks ago. Suddenly, there it is.

23:30.740 --> 23:32.469
Like somebody wanted him to be found.

23:32.642 --> 23:35.702
The detectives I hired didn't say
where they got their information.

23:35.878 --> 23:38.972
- Think your father knew about Lucas?
- Do you even have to ask?

23:39.148 --> 23:43.676
- Lucas was in on this from the beginning.
- Why would he suddenly let you find him?

23:43.853 --> 23:47.755
Because ever since he took LexCorp, he
knows I've been looking to get back at him.

23:47.924 --> 23:50.051
He co-opted Lucas before I could.

23:50.226 --> 23:53.923
While I've been playing checkers,
my father's been playing chess.

24:07.043 --> 24:08.533
Wow.

24:09.612 --> 24:12.581
Say, I love what you've done
with the place.

24:12.782 --> 24:18.516
Is this your newest scam?
Corporate titan in training?

24:22.792 --> 24:26.284
Unlike you, Lex,
I don't live in my father's shadow.

24:26.462 --> 24:28.259
My training's over.

24:28.431 --> 24:30.592
What can I do for you?

24:31.801 --> 24:34.565
Feeling pretty good about yourself
right now, aren't you?

24:34.737 --> 24:37.865
I got to admit,
you and my father played me brilliantly.

24:38.040 --> 24:42.136
Just out of idle curiosity,
when did he contact you?

24:42.311 --> 24:45.178
Three weeks ago.
He told me who he was...

24:45.348 --> 24:50.411
...said you were looking for me,
wanted to use me for some corporate raid.

24:53.489 --> 24:54.751
Let's face it, Lex...

24:56.759 --> 24:58.852
...I'm the son he wants.

25:00.029 --> 25:04.159
Careful, Lucas, you're showing your hand.

25:04.934 --> 25:08.836
Come on, what is it you're really after?

25:09.305 --> 25:11.068
His affection?

25:12.441 --> 25:15.342
Do you really believe if you stick around
he's gonna love you?

25:18.347 --> 25:21.475
Trust me, you don't know him at all.

25:22.485 --> 25:25.977
Get out, Lex. You lost.

25:31.894 --> 25:34.556
I found you because he wanted me to.

25:34.730 --> 25:39.133
- High school kids can track you down.
- You mean your friend Clark Kent.

25:41.203 --> 25:43.694
I bet a lot of people are out
looking for you.

25:43.873 --> 25:49.368
- Like your friends from Edge City.
- Oh, wow, Lex. Is that a threat?

25:49.545 --> 25:53.003
You know, Lucas,
the Luthor gene pool is a shark tank...

25:53.182 --> 25:56.379
...and our father's
just chummed the waters.

25:58.654 --> 26:00.246
Good luck.

26:09.565 --> 26:11.226
There you go.

26:13.169 --> 26:15.831
- Where's Clark?
- Good question.

26:16.005 --> 26:18.132
Lana! Sorry I'm late.

26:18.307 --> 26:22.004
Don't worry about it. You can make it up
by taking these lattes to table three.

26:23.546 --> 26:26.811
- I want you to fire him.
- Fire me? For what?

26:26.982 --> 26:30.713
You're half an hour late to work. Were you
helping Lex dig up more dirt about me?

26:30.886 --> 26:33.582
Lucas, I am not gonna fire Clark.

26:33.756 --> 26:35.485
Okay, then I'll fire you too.

26:35.658 --> 26:38.991
Check our partnership agreement.
You can't do that. Lex made sure of it.

26:42.731 --> 26:46.565
Lex is history, and so is this place.
You can count on it.

26:51.607 --> 26:55.668
- Lucas, wait. You can't do this!
- I'm a Luthor. I can do anything I want.

26:55.845 --> 26:58.939
If you want me to quit, I will,
just leave Lana alone!

27:01.083 --> 27:02.573
Too late.

27:55.938 --> 27:57.235
You okay?

28:21.396 --> 28:23.990
- Dad.
- Lucas.

28:24.199 --> 28:26.429
I heard about last night.

28:26.868 --> 28:30.770
Well, you know, you wouldn't be a Luthor
if somebody wasn't trying to kill you.

28:32.107 --> 28:34.507
It didn't hurt that Clark Kent was there.

28:35.610 --> 28:37.407
I don't know how he reacted so quickly.

28:38.246 --> 28:42.706
Well, Clark is a very special young man.

28:45.353 --> 28:47.344
Did you recognize the shooter?

28:47.522 --> 28:51.356
His name's Dirk. I did some business
with him back in Edge City.

28:51.526 --> 28:53.653
Interesting euphemism.

28:53.995 --> 28:56.486
You don't sound too surprised.

28:56.665 --> 29:00.328
Where do you think you are, Walton
Mountain? Come on, Lucas, think a minute.

29:00.502 --> 29:04.529
You walk in here, you take everything
that belongs to Lex.

29:04.906 --> 29:07.568
You think he's just gonna give up
without a fight?

29:07.743 --> 29:12.737
You know, that's funny because Lex said
that you wanted me out of the picture.

29:13.782 --> 29:15.773
Of course he did.

29:16.952 --> 29:18.442
But you're my son.

29:20.589 --> 29:22.648
Why should I believe you, Dad?

29:22.858 --> 29:24.348
Lucas.

29:25.127 --> 29:27.960
- Look...
- You wanted me out of your life.

29:28.930 --> 29:32.161
You even tried to buy me off.

29:32.968 --> 29:34.458
Why the sudden change of heart?

29:36.238 --> 29:39.799
It was a test.
But you stood up to me...

29:39.975 --> 29:43.411
...turned the tables,
showed me your strength.

29:43.578 --> 29:45.910
That's what it takes to win.

29:46.915 --> 29:49.145
Lex doesn't have that.

29:50.152 --> 29:52.518
Why do you think he's afraid of you?

29:56.992 --> 30:00.325
You've thrown down the gauntlet, Lucas.

30:00.495 --> 30:02.895
You willing to go the distance?

30:03.999 --> 30:06.092
Lex obviously is.

30:11.206 --> 30:14.334
- Hey, Clark.
- Chloe, what'd you find out?

30:14.509 --> 30:18.468
So they caught Lucas' shooter
outside of Metropolis. His name is Dirk Lee.

30:18.647 --> 30:21.343
They tracked him down
with the license plate you gave them.

30:21.516 --> 30:24.713
- Did he tell the police who tipped him off?
- Not exactly.

30:24.886 --> 30:28.287
Somewhere between the booking desk
and a holding cell, Dirk mysteriously...

30:28.456 --> 30:30.822
...keeled over and died.

30:31.459 --> 30:33.120
Someone didn't want him to talk.

30:33.295 --> 30:36.787
Yeah, someone who had enough power
to kill him in a police station.

30:36.965 --> 30:39.627
- You have anyone that comes to mind?
- Cover for me, okay?

30:39.801 --> 30:44.204
No, Clark. I drink coffee,
I do not serve it. Clark!

30:52.981 --> 30:54.471
Mr. Kent.

30:58.486 --> 31:02.183
I wanted to say thank you for everything
you and your family have done for me.

31:03.058 --> 31:04.582
What, you going somewhere, Lex?

31:05.493 --> 31:07.484
Well, I need to talk to my brother...

31:07.662 --> 31:11.098
...and you know what they say about fish
and houseguests after three days.

31:15.036 --> 31:17.368
You're welcome back anytime.

31:19.341 --> 31:21.172
That's nice of you to say.

31:21.343 --> 31:25.177
Look, I gave you every single
crappy farm job I could think of.

31:25.347 --> 31:28.145
But you did them all,
you didn't complain, not once.

31:29.317 --> 31:31.842
You would have made
one hell of a farmer.

31:33.154 --> 31:34.587
Thanks, Mr. Kent.

31:35.056 --> 31:36.614
Sure.

31:40.495 --> 31:45.364
- Lucas, what are you doing?
- Finishing what you started.

31:51.706 --> 31:54.072
- Who is that?
- It's Clark Kent.

31:54.242 --> 31:56.301
Clark. Oh, Clark.

31:56.478 --> 32:00.676
I'm sorry, I meant to call and thank you
for saving Lucas.

32:01.516 --> 32:06.317
Your rescues are becoming
a bit of a Luthor family tradition.

32:07.856 --> 32:10.586
I understand they caught the shooter
in Metropolis.

32:10.759 --> 32:12.488
Yes, I heard that.

32:13.528 --> 32:17.658
So I can assume you've also heard
that he died while in police custody?

32:18.934 --> 32:21.129
That's unfortunate...

32:21.937 --> 32:23.529
...but it happens.

32:23.705 --> 32:25.605
It's just awfully convenient, isn't it?

32:25.774 --> 32:28.743
Kind of like how Lex was able
to track down Lucas.

32:28.910 --> 32:32.141
I think you've inherited
your father's paranoia.

32:32.314 --> 32:35.841
We're not talking about my family,
Mr. Luthor. We're talking about yours.

32:39.387 --> 32:40.979
Good night, Clark.

32:46.328 --> 32:48.694
Send my regards to your mother.

32:55.370 --> 32:56.860
Yeah.

32:57.605 --> 32:59.095
What?

32:59.975 --> 33:02.000
Lucas, where are you?

33:03.611 --> 33:09.106
All right, all right, I'll take the chopper.
Be there in half an hour, my office.

33:09.284 --> 33:12.879
Don't do anything rash,
you understand me?

33:19.327 --> 33:21.022
Lucas?

33:22.030 --> 33:23.622
Glad you could make it.

33:25.567 --> 33:27.228
What the hell are you doing?

33:27.402 --> 33:30.530
Come on, Dad.
This is exactly what you wanted.

33:31.573 --> 33:35.771
Pitted us against each other, and we
played in your Cain and Abel fantasy.

33:39.147 --> 33:42.480
You put the gun down, Lucas.
Put it down.

33:46.087 --> 33:47.714
How do you know he's got a gun?

34:00.869 --> 34:02.996
You twisted son of a bitch!

34:03.171 --> 34:05.935
You're the one who told me
to finish what I started.

34:06.107 --> 34:10.100
Well, as long as Lex is around, I'll always
have to fight for my place in this family.

34:10.277 --> 34:13.770
Lucas, you are not going
to shoot your brother.

34:15.116 --> 34:16.606
You're right.

34:19.821 --> 34:21.447
You are.

34:28.763 --> 34:32.164
What do you expect to achieve, Lucas?
Tell me.

34:32.333 --> 34:35.166
Isn't it obvious, Dad?
Once we're both out of the picture...

34:35.335 --> 34:38.737
...young Lucas here inherits everything.
- Pull the trigger.

34:54.355 --> 34:57.984
Lucas, think. Just think, Lucas.

34:58.526 --> 35:01.757
Think this through.
I'm not your enemy, Lucas.

35:01.929 --> 35:04.523
I'm not the one who deliberately
kept you in foster care.

35:04.699 --> 35:08.066
- You're not helping things, Lex.
- Ever wonder why you were never adopted?

35:08.236 --> 35:11.262
If you were in trouble, how you
got bailed out at the last minute?

35:11.439 --> 35:13.930
Don't tell me you thought
you were just lucky.

35:14.108 --> 35:17.566
We're a social experiment. One son
gets everything, the other gets nothing.

35:17.745 --> 35:20.339
That's ludicrous.
I would never do that.

35:20.515 --> 35:23.450
You would.
Just like you tipped off the shooter.

35:23.618 --> 35:27.520
Your friend Dirk was on our father's payroll.
Edge City was a setup.

35:27.688 --> 35:31.351
- You wanted to use me too.
- Yes, I did and for that I am truly sorry.

35:31.526 --> 35:35.394
But trust me, trying to gain
his love and respect is not worth it.

35:35.863 --> 35:38.832
Is it true?
Is that what you did to me?

35:39.333 --> 35:42.029
We've got a lot to talk about, son.

35:42.203 --> 35:43.864
After you kill Lex.

35:44.472 --> 35:48.738
For once, I want the blood
to be on your hands.

35:53.981 --> 35:55.209
Time's up, Dad.

36:08.996 --> 36:11.396
- No. I can't do it.
- Well, that's just too bad.

36:11.566 --> 36:15.832
Lucas, please, don't.
I will not kill my son.

36:20.641 --> 36:23.542
Psychotic little bastard!

36:29.784 --> 36:31.877
It must be in the genes.

36:38.459 --> 36:40.324
It's blanks.

36:48.703 --> 36:50.534
This one too.

36:54.909 --> 36:56.604
Checkmate.

37:12.059 --> 37:13.856
Come on, Lucas.

37:42.823 --> 37:45.257
- Good night.
- Thanks.

37:52.066 --> 37:55.593
Lana. I realize you're locking up,
but I just need to explain.

37:55.770 --> 37:58.967
It's not necessary. I understand.

37:59.240 --> 38:02.107
- You're not mad.
- Somehow, when you let people down...

38:02.276 --> 38:05.768
...you make it really hard for them
to be mad at you.

38:07.715 --> 38:09.876
- Lana, I just...
- Clark, it isn't you...

38:13.955 --> 38:15.217
So I guess that's it.

38:16.290 --> 38:19.225
The shortest career in the history
of the coffeehouse business.

38:19.393 --> 38:24.092
Second shortest.
Don't forget my one day at the Beanery.

38:27.602 --> 38:30.230
Hope this doesn't change things
between us.

38:32.907 --> 38:36.775
I don't see how things are ever
gonna change between us, Clark.

39:05.239 --> 39:08.174
- That can stay.
- Yes, sir.

39:11.145 --> 39:12.635
Lex.

39:15.483 --> 39:19.544
Glad to see that you're making yourself
at home again, son.

39:19.887 --> 39:23.015
I read your fascinating piece of fiction
in the Daily Planet.

39:26.260 --> 39:29.093
People love to read about triumph
over adversity.

39:30.131 --> 39:32.224
And your stock jumped five points.

39:36.303 --> 39:38.066
How long have you been able to see?

39:40.541 --> 39:42.236
Few weeks.

39:44.612 --> 39:47.945
Playing the handicapped card is low,
even for you.

39:48.115 --> 39:53.109
But I was able to see more clearly
than ever.

39:53.287 --> 39:57.656
It's amazing what people try and get
away with right in front of your eyes...

39:57.825 --> 40:00.293
...when they think you can't see.

40:01.696 --> 40:03.891
I can only imagine.

40:08.035 --> 40:10.026
All right, Lex.

40:12.306 --> 40:17.972
How are we gonna repair
this rift between us?

40:21.115 --> 40:26.314
You mean, how are you gonna
keep the whole Lucas affair quiet?

40:33.761 --> 40:37.527
I was thinking
of giving you LexCorp back.

40:37.698 --> 40:41.190
- Majority stake, no strings attached.
- Except for my silence.

40:42.536 --> 40:45.994
I've always believed that family business
should be kept within the family.

40:46.607 --> 40:49.633
And Lucas is under my protection now.

41:03.624 --> 41:06.718
You remember the fable of the frog
and the scorpion, Lex?

41:09.630 --> 41:11.655
Yeah, Dad.

41:12.233 --> 41:15.100
The frog helped the scorpion
across the river.

41:15.269 --> 41:18.761
The scorpion repaid his kindness
by stinging the frog.

41:18.939 --> 41:21.373
"Why did you do it?"
The dying frog asked him.

41:21.542 --> 41:24.909
And the scorpion replied,
"Because it is my nature."

41:25.679 --> 41:28.512
Believe me, Lex,
your brother will never change.

41:28.783 --> 41:31.775
I've watched him over the years.
The boy's a sociopath.

41:33.187 --> 41:36.054
And I wonder which side of the family tree
he got that from.

41:40.327 --> 41:44.764
Good night, Dad.
I'll be sure to give Lucas your love.

42:01.448 --> 42:04.849
My mom told me you were gonna
come back and get the rest of your stuff.

42:05.653 --> 42:08.713
Surprisingly, my dad's had
a change of heart.

42:08.889 --> 42:11.483
Sorry Lucas didn't turn out to be
the brother you wanted.

42:11.692 --> 42:15.219
Considering his father,
I'm surprised he's still alive at all.

42:16.497 --> 42:17.759
Where is Lucas now?

42:18.399 --> 42:19.889
Safe.

42:20.100 --> 42:23.365
But I'm gonna have some work to do
to regain his trust.

42:24.872 --> 42:27.932
You will. You're not your father.

42:28.442 --> 42:31.639
Sometimes, Clark, we're all held hostage
by the will of our fathers.

42:32.246 --> 42:34.612
The only difference is,
your dad's a good man.

42:34.782 --> 42:37.273
All my father does is push people away.

42:37.818 --> 42:41.083
Your dad opened his home to me,
no questions asked.

42:45.159 --> 42:48.424
As long as I live, I don't think
I'm ever gonna understand your family.

42:48.596 --> 42:50.063
Neither will I.

42:50.231 --> 42:51.562
Just remember...

42:51.899 --> 42:54.766
...my father may try and rule the world...

42:55.002 --> 42:56.902
...but yours will inherit the earth.
