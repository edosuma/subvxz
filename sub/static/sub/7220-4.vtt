00:02.080 --> 00:03.525
<i>Previously on</i> Justified...

00:03.600 --> 00:06.922
Never saw a pizza place with a...
What is that thing?

00:07.000 --> 00:08.080
It's a bank vault.

00:08.440 --> 00:10.522
There ain't no version of
this story that ends with

00:10.600 --> 00:12.921
us selling our home
to some peacock.

00:13.240 --> 00:14.969
You call me
a peacock?

00:15.080 --> 00:16.809
How's Ava doing, Boyd?

00:16.880 --> 00:17.961
It must have been quite a shock,

00:18.080 --> 00:20.082
her getting out of
prison the way she did.

00:20.640 --> 00:22.404
We can't gang up
on him, Katherine.

00:22.480 --> 00:24.847
You're as concerned about
her release as I was.

00:25.440 --> 00:27.090
It is outlining
the terms of your

00:27.160 --> 00:30.050
confidential informant arrangement
with the U.S. Attorney's office

00:30.120 --> 00:32.487
where you stipulate
that you will obtain

00:32.560 --> 00:35.530
relevant information that may lead
to charges against Boyd Crowder.

00:35.600 --> 00:38.410
I was enjoying my
morning constitutional,

00:38.480 --> 00:40.687
and lo and behold,
what do I find

00:40.760 --> 00:42.125
<i>but a stack of real estate deeds</i>

00:42.200 --> 00:44.931
<i>and a ledger that
I believe belong to you.</i>

00:45.000 --> 00:47.207
Since you got out,
sometimes I feel like

00:47.280 --> 00:48.805
I don't know
who you are anymore.

00:49.920 --> 00:51.081
Tell you what.

00:51.160 --> 00:53.811
You come on over here,
and I'll remind you.

01:15.880 --> 01:18.770
Morning.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.287
Are you off somewhere?
I am.

01:23.320 --> 01:25.926
Thought about letting you sleep,

01:26.000 --> 01:28.321
take full advantage
of this king size.

01:29.440 --> 01:32.125
Sneaking out just
didn't seem right. Mmm.

01:32.800 --> 01:34.689
When you think you'll be back?

01:34.760 --> 01:37.081
Little bit?
You gone all day?

01:37.520 --> 01:39.090
I'll be back this afternoon.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.884
Good.
Good?

01:40.960 --> 01:43.930
Wait a second. Ain't
that supposed to be bad?

01:45.680 --> 01:47.728
No. I was just thinking

01:48.040 --> 01:50.088
take advantage,
see about a massage.

01:50.160 --> 01:51.764
I don't know.
Something nice.

01:51.880 --> 01:53.370
Getting used
to the good life, uh?

01:53.440 --> 01:54.441
Mmm-hmm.
Well,

01:54.520 --> 01:56.090
go on.

01:56.160 --> 01:59.482
I'm just happy I got to hear
your voice before I go.

02:03.200 --> 02:04.281
Wait.

02:09.639 --> 02:10.721
Be careful.

02:11.039 --> 02:12.201
Always.

02:44.560 --> 02:46.528
What brings you to Lexington?

02:46.600 --> 02:48.967
Boyd came to meet his masters.

02:49.040 --> 02:50.326
And he brought you along?

02:50.440 --> 02:53.683
Oh, he sprung for
the lovebird package.

02:53.760 --> 02:56.047
Ava, if you're trying to tell
me you're sleeping with him,

02:56.120 --> 02:57.770
just so we're clear,

02:57.840 --> 02:59.524
I ain't asking you to do that.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.045
Are you asking me not to?

03:01.880 --> 03:03.848
I understand you got to do
what you got to do

03:03.920 --> 03:05.365
in a situation like yours.

03:05.440 --> 03:07.283
You think everything
is something else.

03:07.360 --> 03:08.640
You don't think
it could be real?

03:09.480 --> 03:10.720
I'm a person.

03:10.800 --> 03:12.404
I get lonely, scared.

03:12.480 --> 03:14.164
Remind me why we're here.

03:14.240 --> 03:16.049
You mean in this stairwell

03:16.120 --> 03:20.045
instead of a room, two
of us, champagne on ice?

03:29.760 --> 03:32.604
What's it like, holding
someone's fate in your hands?

03:33.480 --> 03:35.448
Drinking make you
a deep thinker?

03:35.520 --> 03:36.646
Oh, I'm straight.

03:36.720 --> 03:39.166
I want to know is it a burden,

03:39.280 --> 03:41.487
or is it what gets you
out of bed in the morning?

03:41.560 --> 03:43.528
What gets me out of bed lately

03:43.600 --> 03:45.762
is helping you fulfill
your agreement with us

03:45.840 --> 03:47.649
so you don't have
to go back to prison.

03:51.080 --> 03:54.368
Avery Markham paid us
a visit yesterday.

03:57.520 --> 03:59.010
Sounds vaguely familiar.

04:00.480 --> 04:02.084
Has a smell of sulfur to him.

04:02.160 --> 04:04.447
Boyd knew him by reputation.

04:04.520 --> 04:05.681
Seemed respectful.

04:06.240 --> 04:07.480
So it wasn't a friendly chat.

04:09.760 --> 04:12.650
He brought along
a real psycho case.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.609
Warned Boyd off
any future pursuits.

04:15.720 --> 04:17.084
Dyed hair, bushy beard?

04:18.760 --> 04:22.287
So, Boyd thought he was pulling
off a small potatoes heist,

04:22.360 --> 04:26.445
and what he was doing was
pissing off the big bad wolf.

04:27.240 --> 04:28.366
This helps, don't it?

04:29.480 --> 04:31.164
Nice to put a face
to the shot caller.

04:32.040 --> 04:33.121
So...

04:34.800 --> 04:39.362
Don't say you and me don't
have a special relationship.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.126
Did I say that?

04:43.720 --> 04:45.085
Boyd must be wetting his pants

04:45.160 --> 04:48.528
thinking about all them
piles and piles of money.

04:50.840 --> 04:52.808
No wonder you're scared.

05:02.760 --> 05:03.966
I'm so sorry, darling.

05:04.040 --> 05:06.486
I didn't mean to startle you.

05:06.560 --> 05:07.721
Can I help you?

05:07.840 --> 05:09.763
Where's my manners?

05:09.840 --> 05:10.966
I'm Katherine Hale.

05:11.080 --> 05:13.082
They gave me a key 'cause
I'm paying for the room.

05:13.560 --> 05:14.721
I did call you,

05:14.800 --> 05:16.643
but, um, you didn't pick up.

05:17.800 --> 05:19.882
I was just out having a smoke.

05:20.080 --> 05:21.650
Ah.

05:21.720 --> 05:25.930
Anyway, I thought it would be
nice if you and I had lunch.

05:27.320 --> 05:28.446
Okay.
Great.

05:29.760 --> 05:32.491
I'll order room service
to my suite.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.886
Noon?

05:33.960 --> 05:35.166
Sure.

05:35.240 --> 05:36.287
423.

05:36.840 --> 05:38.649
Did you forget your cigarettes?

05:38.720 --> 05:39.846
Excuse me?

05:40.680 --> 05:42.364
When you went out.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.923
I just smoke 'em one at a time.

05:48.920 --> 05:51.890
Next time you step out for
one, you let me know.

05:51.960 --> 05:56.648
I don't smoke anymore, but I love
standing next to people who still do.

05:56.760 --> 05:58.364
Okay.

05:58.440 --> 05:59.441
Next time.

06:04.760 --> 06:08.401
I don't have too much
unofficial case memory, Raylan.

06:08.480 --> 06:10.881
Just give me whatever your
addled old brain can muster.

06:11.440 --> 06:15.081
I pulled in a few of Markham's
men over the years.

06:15.160 --> 06:18.209
Maybe one or two run-ins
with the man himself, but...

06:18.960 --> 06:20.121
14 years ago.

06:20.200 --> 06:21.770
Why are you so crotchety?

06:21.840 --> 06:25.049
Don't act like you ain't thrilled to
use your old cop head for a minute,

06:25.120 --> 06:27.930
or did you want to get back to
the 400th hour of cable news?

06:28.240 --> 06:30.720
It obviously hasn't occurred
to you that this pain bullshit

06:30.800 --> 06:32.480
gets in the way of
a lot of clear thinking.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.285
I apologize.
Not to mention

06:35.360 --> 06:37.806
the fact that Leslie's been
waiting on me hand and foot

06:37.880 --> 06:41.089
and feeling sorry for me,
and that shit gets old.

06:41.440 --> 06:43.602
And I know she's sick of me,
and I know she'd rather be

06:43.680 --> 06:45.330
doing yoga with her
hippie friends,

06:45.400 --> 06:47.562
so I had to practically
shove her out the door,

06:47.640 --> 06:51.247
'cause I'm hungry and I'm sick
of eating all of her healthy

06:51.320 --> 06:53.004
twigs and cat food and shit.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.169
Well, you tell her
I said hey, uh?

06:55.360 --> 07:00.890
Grady Hale and Markham, his partner,
made their mint slinging weed.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.685
Grady Hale being Katherine
Hale's husband? Yeah.

07:03.920 --> 07:06.082
And when Grady Hale
went to jail,

07:06.160 --> 07:08.845
Markham went nobody knew where.

07:08.920 --> 07:10.922
You saying Markham flipped?

07:11.000 --> 07:12.047
Somebody did.

07:12.680 --> 07:14.842
As far as I know, the only
person that ever knew

07:14.920 --> 07:18.367
the name of the snitch was U.S.
Attorney Simon Poole,

07:18.440 --> 07:20.886
and he forgot that when
they blew half his head off

07:21.000 --> 07:23.924
with a shotgun on the corner
of Limestone and Barr.

07:24.760 --> 07:26.091
Was Markham a rat?

07:27.280 --> 07:29.886
Seems like Poole
let it slip one time that

07:29.960 --> 07:32.725
his snitch was out of the
weed business, but...

07:33.840 --> 07:37.367
You know, maybe when my
cable runs out, I'll look into it.

07:38.240 --> 07:39.321
Hmm.

07:41.040 --> 07:42.929
Now, that's how
you fry a damn egg.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.047
Why?

07:44.120 --> 07:45.485
Why what?
Any of it.

07:46.920 --> 07:48.445
What's it all mean?

07:48.520 --> 07:50.488
Well, you're gonna nail Boyd
Crowder and move to Florida,

07:50.560 --> 07:52.403
what do you care?
It's interesting.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.603
Spins this thing a whole
another way, hmm?

07:54.680 --> 07:56.205
Mmm-hmm.

07:56.280 --> 07:58.806
Sheds new light on an
ever spreading circle of

07:58.880 --> 08:01.360
greed and evil
and murder and mayhem.

08:01.440 --> 08:02.885
Oh, okay.

08:03.720 --> 08:06.007
When you stray from
the trail, Raylan,

08:06.080 --> 08:07.445
that's when you get lost.

08:07.880 --> 08:09.803
I know that, Art.
I do.

08:10.840 --> 08:13.286
But something's pulling me on.
Mmm-hmm.

08:13.720 --> 08:17.008
Something's pulling you away from nailing
Boyd and getting down to Florida.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.161
Your mama asks you
to take out the trash,

08:18.240 --> 08:21.050
you do as she says, but you see
a copperhead on the way out,

08:21.120 --> 08:23.691
you don't go back inside,
say you didn't do nothing,

08:23.760 --> 08:26.650
because all she asked
was take out the trash.

08:26.720 --> 08:28.927
You take out the trash
and the snake.

08:29.240 --> 08:31.891
Didn't your mama ever tell you
that there's always another snake?

08:32.799 --> 08:34.039
I knew you'd say that.

08:34.120 --> 08:37.363
Raylan, if you declare
war on them all,

08:37.440 --> 08:40.443
they're just gonna
outbreed you and outlast you

08:40.520 --> 08:41.885
and bring you down for good.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.967
You telling me
not to do the job?

08:44.760 --> 08:45.807
No.

08:47.120 --> 08:49.885
I'm telling you not
to get your ass bit.

09:22.280 --> 09:24.203
We can't make sense
of your CYA book.

09:25.120 --> 09:28.203
Safe to assume the names
herein are landowners?

09:32.160 --> 09:33.525
This room ain't bugged.

09:33.600 --> 09:35.250
Won't nobody know we spoke.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.161
These landowners are
in the ledger

09:37.240 --> 09:39.208
'cause Avery Markham
has designs on buying?

09:41.240 --> 09:42.480
Or has already bought.

09:42.640 --> 09:44.768
How many? How many have
lines through them?

09:44.840 --> 09:46.251
Many.

09:46.320 --> 09:48.971
A line through a name means...

09:51.360 --> 09:53.283
Cash was offered and accepted.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.601
What's it mean a name has a
line through it and a circle?

09:55.680 --> 09:59.082
Means first offer declined,
counteroffer accepted.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.567
Red Crowell's name was circled
and a line through it.

10:01.640 --> 10:02.926
How'd you sweeten the deal?

10:03.000 --> 10:04.490
Upped the offer $50,000.

10:04.560 --> 10:05.561
Nothing else?

10:06.040 --> 10:08.042
You know there was
a fire there a week ago?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.047
Sad.

10:10.800 --> 10:13.963
Red lost everything. Had to move
in with his kin down in Nashville.

10:14.040 --> 10:15.121
We stopped by.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.884
Place burned to the
concrete footings.

10:17.160 --> 10:20.562
The house was a wreck. There was
wires hanging out everywhere.

10:20.680 --> 10:21.727
Mess, too.

10:22.200 --> 10:24.123
Looked like he was
hoarding for the rapture.

10:24.200 --> 10:26.407
Talked to the chief.
He ruled out foul play,

10:26.520 --> 10:29.285
though he did note there were
more fires in town as of late.

10:29.360 --> 10:33.206
Murphy's law, simplest
explanation is usually correct.

10:33.320 --> 10:34.651
You mean Occam's razor.

10:34.720 --> 10:37.485
Occam's razor, Thor's
hammer, who gives a shit?

10:37.560 --> 10:40.689
Like as not, it's folks
looking for the insurance.

10:40.760 --> 10:42.569
No, not Red Crowell.

10:43.520 --> 10:47.411
Look, they're big talkers,
but that's real estate.

10:47.640 --> 10:48.880
I don't think they're bad men.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.731
And yet you're spooked so much
that we got to pull it out of you.

10:52.040 --> 10:54.327
I'm just saying
Markham wants land,

10:54.400 --> 10:56.050
he doesn't have to work
that hard for it.

10:56.120 --> 10:58.407
He goes five miles
down the road.

10:58.480 --> 10:59.845
He can buy whatever he wants.

10:59.920 --> 11:03.163
Not if the pot king of Colorado's
got his sights set on Harlan.

11:03.240 --> 11:04.730
If he and his coadjutors

11:04.800 --> 11:06.689
want to seize an opportunity

11:06.760 --> 11:09.240
in the land of the
Christmas tree weed,

11:09.320 --> 11:11.004
who are we to fetter progress?

11:11.080 --> 11:14.004
Don't give a shit about
his business agenda.

11:14.080 --> 11:17.209
Though I worry about those
who stand in his way.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.603
That include you.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.728
Look, fellas, I've
been helpful, right?

11:22.040 --> 11:23.724
Are we wrapping this up?

11:23.800 --> 11:25.370
I have a speech to write.

11:26.440 --> 11:28.727
Twisting my stomach in knots.

11:28.800 --> 11:30.131
Running for mayor again?

11:30.360 --> 11:32.044
No. I've had
a rough day.

11:32.120 --> 11:34.487
I have to eulogize
a friend tonight.

11:34.560 --> 11:36.369
Sorry to hear it.
Pillar of the community.

11:36.800 --> 11:39.451
She and her husband died in
the damn strangest accident.

11:41.800 --> 11:42.961
What kind of accident?

11:43.280 --> 11:45.089
Furnace took a shit.

11:45.760 --> 11:48.286
Carbon monoxide killed
them both in their sleep.

11:49.080 --> 11:50.286
Who we talking about?

11:50.480 --> 11:52.164
Betty and John-O Hutchins.

11:53.040 --> 11:54.690
Betty Hutchins
the English teacher?

11:54.760 --> 11:55.886
Same.

11:55.960 --> 11:57.769
Hutchins was a name on the list.

11:58.600 --> 12:00.762
Circled and X'd out.

12:01.480 --> 12:05.246
That means more than
one offer was made.

12:05.320 --> 12:06.810
Both refused.

12:11.160 --> 12:12.969
You were a cheerleader
in high school.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.081
I was.

12:15.160 --> 12:16.924
I always wanted
to be a cheerleader.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.001
Football games,

12:18.360 --> 12:21.682
I'd sit high up in those stands

12:21.800 --> 12:25.202
and watch those girls
bouncing in their skirts,

12:25.280 --> 12:26.645
see how all the players

12:27.160 --> 12:29.970
well, everyone, really,

12:30.040 --> 12:32.168
was just mesmerized by them.

12:32.640 --> 12:35.610
It was a lot of work. We
practiced five days a week.

12:35.680 --> 12:37.762
What power those girls had.

12:39.840 --> 12:42.525
Yet so few knew how to use it.

12:43.720 --> 12:46.291
But you did, huh?

12:47.200 --> 12:50.409
You got one of those football
players to marry you.

12:50.480 --> 12:51.641
I did.

12:52.920 --> 12:54.604
Doesn't mean I had
any real power.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.407
Because he beat you senseless?

12:59.680 --> 13:00.966
You know a lot about me.

13:01.520 --> 13:04.364
I know you blew
a hole through his chest.

13:05.480 --> 13:08.723
Did you invite me to lunch
to talk about my past?

13:10.040 --> 13:12.850
I invited you to lunch
to ask you a question.

13:13.720 --> 13:16.530
I'm not sure I want to hear it.

13:17.280 --> 13:19.886
I was married to Grady
for 20 years.

13:20.200 --> 13:23.443
And I loved that man
with all my heart.

13:23.520 --> 13:25.887
But there were days...

13:26.440 --> 13:28.249
Weeks...

13:29.040 --> 13:30.565
Months, really.

13:33.560 --> 13:35.801
My question is this

13:37.040 --> 13:41.443
when you pulled that
trigger, how did it feel?

13:42.960 --> 13:45.406
'Cause I have to think
it felt great.

13:50.520 --> 13:53.251
Are you wondering
what's under here?

13:55.120 --> 13:57.043
Should I be?

13:57.120 --> 13:59.600
It is the best part
of this lunch.

14:08.040 --> 14:09.610
That's never been my thing.

14:12.120 --> 14:15.283
Well, darling,
this is the good stuff.

14:15.800 --> 14:18.804
This is pharmaceutical grade.
And believe me...

14:19.400 --> 14:22.483
You are gonna need it
for what I've got planned.

14:22.560 --> 14:26.360
None of the barons can deposit
in legit FDIC backed banks,

14:26.440 --> 14:29.444
marijuana being legal
only at the state level.

14:29.800 --> 14:33.407
Hence mercenaries guarding
a pizza place full of dough.

14:35.320 --> 14:37.209
Did you see what I did there?

14:37.280 --> 14:40.887
Well, a man's wit is never
lost on me, Wynn Duffy. Hey.

14:42.280 --> 14:44.362
So, you're telling me that
Avery Markham really believes

14:44.440 --> 14:46.283
that legal weed is coming
to the state of Kentucky?

14:46.360 --> 14:48.249
Probably sooner than later.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.049
The way the smoke's blowing.

14:50.920 --> 14:54.686
FYI, my guy's a handful,
irritating.

14:54.760 --> 14:57.730
His brain's fried from who
knows what kind of drugs.

14:57.800 --> 15:00.326
You're gonna want to punch
him, but he's very good.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.728
I'm saying have fun with it.

15:10.840 --> 15:12.285
They're here, baby.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.921
Looky here!

15:15.000 --> 15:16.126
Wynn Duffy!

15:16.920 --> 15:18.126
You're looking healthy.

15:18.200 --> 15:19.611
Been a long time.

15:19.680 --> 15:22.524
What can I say? I save you for the
big jobs, man of your talent.

15:22.600 --> 15:24.409
Oh, yeah.
And my price.

15:24.520 --> 15:26.761
- You must be the man with the vault problem.
- Now, Mr. Wiz,

15:26.840 --> 15:29.684
I prefer discussing
my business in private.

15:29.800 --> 15:31.245
Bridge is cool.

15:31.320 --> 15:32.606
I didn't say she wasn't cool.

15:34.520 --> 15:35.931
What's the matter?

15:36.000 --> 15:37.161
Rudy likes you.

15:39.360 --> 15:41.806
So, uh, just spitballing
on the ride over,

15:41.880 --> 15:43.689
we were thinking, uh, Emulex?

15:46.320 --> 15:47.526
Emulex?

15:47.600 --> 15:51.241
Emulex to blow
an Excelsior 5200?

15:51.320 --> 15:53.288
That was part of the plan, yeah.

15:53.360 --> 15:55.283
Are you ser...
Oh, my God.

15:55.360 --> 15:57.567
Excelsior's old school!

15:57.640 --> 16:00.484
It's 16 inches of
Youngstown steel, dude.

16:00.560 --> 16:01.766
You need something massive

16:01.880 --> 16:03.769
C-4?
To get through that shit.

16:03.840 --> 16:06.684
No, man, I'm talking,
like, C-11, dude.

16:06.760 --> 16:09.730
New military issue, like
asymmetrical warfare shit.

16:09.880 --> 16:11.370
That shit only you got,
huh, baby?

16:11.440 --> 16:13.568
Damn straight
only the shit I got!

16:13.640 --> 16:14.846
And if they catch you with it,

16:14.920 --> 16:16.524
they're taking you
to Guantanamo Bay

16:16.600 --> 16:18.240
and hooking your nuts up
to a car battery.

16:18.480 --> 16:19.845
Oh!

16:19.920 --> 16:21.206
Where's my manners?

16:21.280 --> 16:22.691
Would you guys like a Negroni?

16:22.720 --> 16:24.290
I don't know what that is.
It's Italian.

16:24.360 --> 16:25.960
Tastes like grapefruit.
I don't want one.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.411
Missing out.

16:29.880 --> 16:31.484
So, you got it
all worked out, uh?

16:31.560 --> 16:32.721
I do.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.889
Would you mind taking
me through the steps?

16:34.960 --> 16:37.008
Trust, brother, trust.

16:37.080 --> 16:38.764
Well, that's the thing, Wiz.

16:40.160 --> 16:42.049
I wasn't asking, so...

16:42.760 --> 16:44.330
Oh, whoa, easy, easy, easy.

16:44.440 --> 16:46.681
No static, bro.

16:46.760 --> 16:49.491
I got us another Excelsior.

16:50.480 --> 16:53.689
Yeah. It's in a derelict foundry
on the outside of town.

16:53.760 --> 16:57.162
It's too big to move,
too expensive to dismantle.

16:57.240 --> 16:58.600
Place is empty.
We can get in there

16:58.640 --> 16:59.840
and make all the noise we want,

16:59.880 --> 17:00.881
do some test runs.

17:00.960 --> 17:02.166
I could talk about it
here all day,

17:02.240 --> 17:03.890
or we could go in there
and just do it.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.650
Then why are we still here?

17:05.960 --> 17:07.484
Let's go do the shit!

17:14.800 --> 17:17.007
Goddamn!

17:17.640 --> 17:19.961
Just the smell of the
metal makes me hard.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.727
That the same one
as the pizza place?

17:22.800 --> 17:24.290
Well, I ain't the manufacturer.

17:25.079 --> 17:26.286
But it looks close enough.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.371
Looks like it's in pretty good
shape, too, for being abandoned.

17:29.440 --> 17:31.329
Hell, an A-bomb
could go off,

17:32.080 --> 17:34.162
this baby would still be
standing in the rubble.

17:34.280 --> 17:36.408
Well, Wiz, that doesn't exactly
inspire a lot of confidence

17:36.480 --> 17:38.448
in your ability to
get inside this thing.

17:38.520 --> 17:40.966
Dude, I get through time locks,

17:41.360 --> 17:43.886
magnetic seals,
shit you wouldn't understand

17:44.000 --> 17:45.650
even if I drew you a diagram.

17:45.720 --> 17:47.370
This old pile of tungsten,

17:47.440 --> 17:48.805
this is just pure brute force.

17:49.560 --> 17:50.686
Drill and kill.

17:51.160 --> 17:52.366
You want to see what I can do?

17:54.040 --> 17:55.405
Next time, make it tough.

17:55.840 --> 17:57.524
One job at a time, Wiz.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.126
Okay.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.843
Give me your cellphones.

18:14.520 --> 18:17.649
Ava, come over here and
meet the classiest jeweler

18:17.720 --> 18:19.324
this side of the Mississippi.

18:19.400 --> 18:21.448
Oh, so nice to
meet you, Winston.

18:21.520 --> 18:23.522
Beautiful pieces you have here.

18:23.800 --> 18:26.883
I feel like I should've worn my
sunglasses, all the sparkling around.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.206
Okay, he gets it.

18:28.520 --> 18:30.284
Oh! Speaking of diamonds,

18:30.360 --> 18:31.441
may I?

18:31.520 --> 18:32.681
Of course.

18:32.760 --> 18:34.250
The tennis bracelet.

18:34.320 --> 18:36.368
Oh, I love that.
Hmm.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.365
There we are.

18:39.440 --> 18:42.091
Oh, my goodness,
what a sight.

18:43.040 --> 18:45.008
Winston, would you
do me a favor?

18:45.080 --> 18:47.048
Would you let Ava
try on something pretty

18:47.120 --> 18:48.884
to just give her
a little thrill?

18:48.960 --> 18:50.200
Surely.

18:52.120 --> 18:53.963
Is there anything

18:54.040 --> 18:55.166
that strikes your fancy?

18:55.560 --> 18:57.130
Oh, the whole store does.

18:57.240 --> 18:59.004
One thing prettier
than the next.

18:59.720 --> 19:02.326
Well, now, let's see.

19:03.400 --> 19:05.767
How about these?

19:07.080 --> 19:11.051
That's okay. I feel funny even
picking up something that expensive.

19:11.120 --> 19:12.804
Afraid I might drop it
or something.

19:12.920 --> 19:14.888
No, they won't bite.
Here.

19:14.960 --> 19:16.121
Okay.

19:17.440 --> 19:18.487
Oh.

19:19.240 --> 19:20.241
Oh, my.

19:20.920 --> 19:22.684
I look like a movie star.

19:22.760 --> 19:24.603
You do.
Matches your eyes.

19:25.360 --> 19:26.964
Thank you so much.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.087
Of course...
Shit!

19:28.560 --> 19:30.240
I just knew I was gonna drop it.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.927
No problem, ma'am.
Happens all the time.

19:37.440 --> 19:39.044
There we go.

19:39.880 --> 19:41.480
Is there anything else
you'd like to see?

19:41.720 --> 19:44.371
Uh... I think
that's enough for me.

19:44.440 --> 19:47.364
Winston, I'm gonna pass on
the tennis bracelet for now.

19:47.440 --> 19:48.646
Maybe next time.

19:48.720 --> 19:49.926
So good to see you.

19:50.040 --> 19:51.883
It's always a pleasure.
All right.

19:57.720 --> 19:58.926
Whoo-hoo.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.729
My heart's beating
like a jackrabbit!

20:00.800 --> 20:03.280
Just run with it, honey.
It's all part of the fun.

20:03.360 --> 20:04.771
That place was covered
in cameras.

20:04.880 --> 20:06.370
What if he decides to call the...
Oh, Winston

20:06.440 --> 20:08.647
is not gonna do jack shit.

20:08.720 --> 20:11.644
He's too afraid I still have
the juice to have him killed,

20:11.720 --> 20:13.643
him or one of his
mongoloid sons.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.881
When Grady was at his peak,

20:16.960 --> 20:18.724
I had a charge account
at that store

20:18.800 --> 20:20.643
and a dozen others just like it.

20:21.600 --> 20:22.840
Shit...

20:23.400 --> 20:25.721
Winston used to greet me
at that door with champagne.

20:25.800 --> 20:27.882
Now he locks it on me.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.724
Screw him.

20:40.080 --> 20:42.003
When you gonna tell me? What?

20:42.080 --> 20:43.650
The story of Mrs. Hutchins?

20:43.760 --> 20:45.091
Was she the teacher who cared?

20:45.160 --> 20:47.447
She watered little Raylan
so he could blossom?

20:47.520 --> 20:49.249
I hated her.
She hated English.

20:49.320 --> 20:51.004
Nearly turned me off of books.

20:51.080 --> 20:54.050
Only thing she taught me was
don't do a job just for money.

20:54.120 --> 20:56.327
Well, now you're doing
what you love.

20:56.440 --> 20:57.965
Miss Hutchins, American hero.

20:58.240 --> 20:59.640
How much do you want
to bet that she

20:59.680 --> 21:01.842
and Mr. Hutchins didn't die
peacefully in their sleep?

21:01.920 --> 21:04.048
Oh, but it's such
a nice thought.

21:04.440 --> 21:06.249
It's how I want to go.

21:06.320 --> 21:07.321
I'm kidding.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.971
I want Sigourney Weaver to
choke me out with her thighs.

21:10.080 --> 21:12.526
You understand I'm
formulating a theory here?

21:13.360 --> 21:17.649
You think Markham's "Coadjutors"
made it look that way?

21:17.960 --> 21:19.610
Mmm-hmm. Made an offer
on the property,

21:19.680 --> 21:21.808
got refused.
Good theory, right?

21:21.880 --> 21:24.884
Seeing as how Harlan isn't much
in the way of farmland, yeah.

21:25.520 --> 21:28.410
Those names in Calhoun's books
are probably the primo spots.

21:28.480 --> 21:31.484
Markham gets those, he can
plant a shit ton of pot crops,

21:31.600 --> 21:33.284
betting Kentucky goes legal.

21:33.360 --> 21:36.364
Which, if it does,
good for Kentucky.

21:37.280 --> 21:40.648
But if he's acting like one
of them Old West black hats

21:40.720 --> 21:43.200
forcing homesteaders
off their land,

21:44.080 --> 21:45.650
that ain't gonna stand.

21:45.720 --> 21:48.929
It's just with fire, you
could maybe prove arson.

21:49.760 --> 21:51.489
It's a failed furnace
in an old house?

21:51.560 --> 21:53.130
It's a theory.

21:53.200 --> 21:55.646
This is what you get with
a teacher's pension, uh?

21:58.240 --> 21:59.810
Congratulate me.

22:01.920 --> 22:03.081
What is that?

22:03.160 --> 22:05.766
Window's covered in plastic
and taped shut.

22:06.320 --> 22:09.688
I bet you a silver dollar
they got no next of kin,

22:09.760 --> 22:12.889
house goes up for auction,
Markham gets it for a song.

22:13.960 --> 22:15.246
Okay, then.

22:21.520 --> 22:23.602
Maui.
Maui?

22:24.560 --> 22:27.245
Where I grew up, the
mean streets of Paia.

22:28.280 --> 22:30.328
Surfed the bay every
morning before school.

22:32.120 --> 22:35.920
Wynn Duffy on a surfboard. That's
something I have a hard time picturing.

22:36.240 --> 22:38.322
I'll show you
my trophies one day.

22:38.400 --> 22:41.370
A million dollars does afford
a man a lot of sex wax.

22:41.440 --> 22:43.488
Although given
what we're about to do,

22:43.560 --> 22:44.721
I'm surprised
you ain't planning to surf

22:44.840 --> 22:46.524
somewhere far,
far away from here.

22:47.840 --> 22:49.410
That your plan?

22:49.480 --> 22:53.041
Sequester yourself in some
lost corner of the globe?

22:53.680 --> 22:55.648
You speak Farsi, do ya?

22:55.720 --> 22:56.960
Tunisian?

22:57.520 --> 22:59.966
For one thing, they speak
Arabic in Tunisia.

23:00.040 --> 23:03.089
Second, my future address
has yet to be decided.

23:03.480 --> 23:04.845
Hey, does it swing
right or left?

23:05.320 --> 23:07.049
I'm assuming you mean
the vault door?

23:07.120 --> 23:09.407
Well, I ain't talking about
your little white pee-pee.

23:09.480 --> 23:10.527
Yeah. Which way?

23:10.960 --> 23:12.041
Let's go right.

23:12.160 --> 23:13.207
And what year was it?

23:13.280 --> 23:14.441
Why?

23:14.520 --> 23:17.444
Because in 1970, Excelsior
changed their design.

23:17.520 --> 23:19.841
They started sandwiching
out the copper alloy.

23:19.960 --> 23:22.247
They were...
You know what?

23:22.320 --> 23:23.970
Never mind.
It's all good.

23:24.040 --> 23:26.327
The Wiz always has it covered.

23:29.720 --> 23:31.927
I told you assholes to leave
your cellphones in the car!

23:47.800 --> 23:49.404
Ho, ho!

23:50.000 --> 23:51.445
What up, pimps?

23:53.080 --> 23:57.847
To what do I owe these particular
splinters in my asshole today?

23:58.600 --> 24:01.046
If splinters are all you're
getting back there, Dickie,

24:01.120 --> 24:02.360
prison has treated you well.

24:02.440 --> 24:03.771
Isn't that
just like you?

24:03.840 --> 24:05.569
Isn't that just like him?

24:05.640 --> 24:10.123
To find hurtful potty mouth
humor in sexual assault.

24:10.200 --> 24:11.361
Maybe I should apologize.

24:11.440 --> 24:13.249
Maybe I should tease you
about the wheelchair.

24:13.680 --> 24:15.728
I get conflicting impulses
when I see you.

24:15.800 --> 24:17.802
Sure you lovers
don't want a conjugal?

24:18.920 --> 24:20.160
Candy? Cookies?

24:20.680 --> 24:23.126
Chocolate donuts in a box?

24:23.200 --> 24:24.281
Don't forget soda pop.

24:24.400 --> 24:25.401
And soda pop.

24:27.520 --> 24:29.648
I get it. I get it.
I see you two.

24:29.880 --> 24:32.281
This right here,
this is a, what you call it?

24:32.360 --> 24:34.522
A revelation.
This is... Yeah!

24:34.600 --> 24:38.127
This is one of them
ecstatic visions

24:38.200 --> 24:39.361
I've been having of late.

24:39.440 --> 24:42.091
All right, all right!
Here we go.

24:42.840 --> 24:44.285
Mighty spirit.

24:44.360 --> 24:45.691
Dickie Bennett,

24:46.040 --> 24:48.168
this is archangel Raylan,

24:48.960 --> 24:51.850
here to deliver unto thee

24:51.920 --> 24:55.891
a loaded up commissary in
exchange for your cooperation

24:55.960 --> 24:58.611
in a Federal Criminal
Investigation. Oh!

24:58.680 --> 25:01.160
Message received,
but I'm afraid what you ask...

25:01.240 --> 25:04.005
It's just, it's too great.

25:04.080 --> 25:05.080
It really is.

25:05.120 --> 25:07.726
I cannot see a way
to answer your call.

25:08.240 --> 25:09.480
Search your soul, numb nuts.

25:09.560 --> 25:14.009
Can you not see the Lord
herself hath damned me with...

25:15.560 --> 25:17.722
Incipient diabetes?

25:19.160 --> 25:20.207
You shitting me?

25:20.440 --> 25:21.851
Negatory.

25:21.920 --> 25:23.649
So barter the sweets.
Get what you want.

25:24.320 --> 25:26.129
There you go.

25:27.160 --> 25:30.243
I don't believe you,
you're hearing me.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.129
What I'm trying to say is,
I'll break it down here...

25:39.800 --> 25:41.609
Well, we can go the other way.

25:42.280 --> 25:44.123
Just make life
in here unpleasant.

25:44.200 --> 25:46.168
- More unpleasant.
- The threats, yes.

25:46.560 --> 25:48.324
Here they come.
Bring it on.

25:48.440 --> 25:50.886
This is my favorite part.

25:50.960 --> 25:52.803
We're upsetting you?
You want us to leave?

25:52.880 --> 25:54.405
You could just tell us
who bought your land.

25:54.480 --> 25:57.131
Records indicate
LM Consolidated.

25:57.240 --> 25:59.004
The broker's name
turned out to be a fake.

25:59.080 --> 26:01.321
Who was it wanted their
identity concealed?

26:01.400 --> 26:02.606
Yes,
you're absolutely right.

26:02.680 --> 26:05.889
I would be delighted
to tell you why I sold it.

26:06.680 --> 26:08.489
Would you like to?

26:08.560 --> 26:09.721
This ought to be good.

26:10.200 --> 26:11.690
I hope you made a tidy sum

26:11.760 --> 26:12.921
for your dumbassedness.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.526
Drove a hard bargain,
yeah, yeah.

26:15.600 --> 26:17.921
But I did I managed to.
I pushed her back.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.082
I did, and I ended up with...

26:20.160 --> 26:22.208
A tidy sum.

26:22.920 --> 26:24.160
Her?
Yeah, her.

26:24.240 --> 26:28.768
The guy behind the guy
is said to have been,

26:28.840 --> 26:30.490
after all that, a she.

26:30.960 --> 26:32.928
You follow that?

26:35.200 --> 26:38.010
She was a she?
LM Consolidated?

26:38.080 --> 26:39.241
You never met her?

26:39.320 --> 26:41.687
That's what I said the last five times.
I'll give you six.

26:44.280 --> 26:48.126
You were so hot to start a feud
with me that had long since ended,

26:48.200 --> 26:52.125
you sold your ancestral
land to Loretta McCready?

26:53.440 --> 26:54.680
Loretta?

26:57.840 --> 26:59.080
Loretta?

27:00.040 --> 27:03.123
That good land has
more to it than rich soil.

27:03.200 --> 27:05.089
It has history.

27:05.160 --> 27:07.970
And we know your desire
to build on that history,

27:08.040 --> 27:10.850
which is in line
with our desire.

27:10.920 --> 27:12.888
In short, the future.

27:14.600 --> 27:16.443
Now, the other thing
I wanted to tell you

27:16.880 --> 27:19.008
is to forget our first offer.

27:19.080 --> 27:21.003
We're now prepared
to pay you twice that

27:21.240 --> 27:22.890
to show you how committed we are

27:22.960 --> 27:25.406
to the preservation and
prosperity of this land.

27:25.960 --> 27:28.122
Well, I'll need
to think about that.

27:28.200 --> 27:32.603
Well, consider that if you
invest that money wisely,

27:32.680 --> 27:35.081
hell, you can burn
through half of it first.

27:37.080 --> 27:38.920
And you'll still never
work a day in your life.

27:41.920 --> 27:44.287
I like to drink when I think.

27:44.360 --> 27:45.407
Care to join?

27:45.920 --> 27:47.046
Sure.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.441
I got this from a dear friend.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.530
She called it apple pie.

27:54.600 --> 27:55.931
Not too sweet, I hope.

27:57.080 --> 27:59.048
Too sweet gives me a headache.

27:59.600 --> 28:01.489
It's not sweet, but...

28:03.040 --> 28:04.963
It might still give you
a headache.

28:22.520 --> 28:23.567
What's this shit?

28:24.280 --> 28:26.203
Good evening to you,
too, Loretta.

28:26.280 --> 28:27.327
Can we talk?

28:27.400 --> 28:28.606
She's right
in the middle of something.

28:28.760 --> 28:29.841
That doesn't bother us.

28:30.360 --> 28:31.885
Actually, we're done.

28:31.960 --> 28:33.520
But that don't mean
I feel like talking.

28:33.800 --> 28:35.928
Done?
No, we're not done.

28:36.200 --> 28:37.565
Don't be silly.

28:37.640 --> 28:38.801
Oh, we're done.

28:38.880 --> 28:41.406
I was about to pour you
a drink and show you out.

28:41.880 --> 28:43.080
So you're rejecting our offer?

28:43.280 --> 28:44.441
I am.

28:44.640 --> 28:47.166
But we didn't even negotiate.

28:47.240 --> 28:48.844
- No means no.
- Hey!

28:48.920 --> 28:50.081
I'm not talking to you.

28:50.560 --> 28:51.846
Loretta, do me a favor.

28:52.440 --> 28:54.169
Take a big old step
to your right.

28:58.520 --> 28:59.601
Okay.

28:59.680 --> 29:01.842
You ain't talking to me.
She's done talking to you.

29:02.760 --> 29:04.171
Now, you want to
get your ass out,

29:04.240 --> 29:06.000
or is there something else
you're here to do?

29:17.680 --> 29:18.681
Mr. Markham.

29:38.280 --> 29:39.691
Avery Markham, I presume.

29:40.160 --> 29:41.730
You must be Givens.

29:42.040 --> 29:43.883
Deputy U.S. Marshal Givens.

29:45.480 --> 29:47.528
This young woman
must be Loretta.

29:48.040 --> 29:49.690
Pleased to meet you, Miss.

29:49.920 --> 29:52.810
Though I envisioned it under
different circumstances.

29:54.560 --> 29:57.689
Why don't we sit down, have
a civilized conversation?

29:58.120 --> 29:59.201
We'll be brief.

29:59.280 --> 30:02.682
Well, these bones
are gonna take a chair

30:03.560 --> 30:04.686
either way.

30:08.280 --> 30:10.248
Well, what have we here?

30:11.760 --> 30:13.364
Mmm.

30:13.440 --> 30:14.601
That takes me back.

30:15.080 --> 30:16.684
This yours?
Yes, sir.

30:16.760 --> 30:18.524
You mind?
Of course not.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.081
Go ahead, darling.

30:21.280 --> 30:23.806
Stick your little pinkie
in there and have a lick.

30:35.960 --> 30:37.291
Okay, now.

30:38.320 --> 30:41.449
I'll give you this. You've
done your homework.

30:44.240 --> 30:46.129
Homework, hell.

30:46.240 --> 30:47.924
I'm a corn cracker
through and through.

30:48.720 --> 30:50.449
Grew up with
my hands in the dirt.

30:51.280 --> 30:53.931
My daddy was a 'bacca
farmer out in Cynthiana,

30:55.560 --> 30:57.130
raising up burley.

30:57.200 --> 30:58.770
Traded one leaf for another.

31:02.800 --> 31:06.122
I've spent many days
in this neck of the woods.

31:07.480 --> 31:08.891
Knew Miss McCready's daddy

31:09.600 --> 31:11.125
and her mama.

31:11.240 --> 31:14.323
Bennetts, too,
us being in the same line.

31:16.200 --> 31:19.841
How I knew to check
that glass, darlin'.

31:22.440 --> 31:25.410
I knew a Crowder or two,

31:25.480 --> 31:27.642
but no one
by the name of Givens.

31:27.960 --> 31:31.043
Arlo's wannabe kingpin ass
would be heartbroken.

31:31.120 --> 31:34.602
Six generations of Bennetts
grew up in Harlan County.

31:35.440 --> 31:38.364
Now all's left is
a cripple stuck in lockup.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.923
Story is that's thanks to you.

31:42.640 --> 31:44.529
The Bennetts were my problem.

31:44.600 --> 31:45.726
Now you are my problem.

31:45.840 --> 31:48.047
Somebody please tell me what
all you're talking about.

31:48.120 --> 31:51.567
The man is making you
an offer you can't refuse.

31:51.680 --> 31:53.364
Sell or he kills you.

31:53.440 --> 31:55.169
Oh, come on, now.

31:55.680 --> 31:58.047
I may make you an offer
you can't refuse.

31:58.120 --> 32:00.881
But that's because I'm offering you
more money than you ever imagined.

32:01.360 --> 32:03.488
And if I don't want it
at any price?

32:03.560 --> 32:06.131
Then you'd be a bird so rare

32:06.200 --> 32:09.363
as to never before
have been sighted.

32:09.440 --> 32:11.488
The negotiation has ended.

32:12.200 --> 32:14.407
I told you,
you can't have my land.

32:14.480 --> 32:15.606
I'm adding hers to the list.

32:16.680 --> 32:20.287
I don't see how you can do
that, legally speaking.

32:20.360 --> 32:22.761
You want to follow
that thread, be my guest.

32:22.840 --> 32:26.208
Till then, you can put away
your suitcase of money.

32:26.600 --> 32:28.125
Or what?

32:28.200 --> 32:30.441
You gonna give me 24 hours
to get out of town,

32:30.520 --> 32:33.126
Deputy U.S. Marshal
Raylan Givens?

32:33.200 --> 32:35.043
And he said he didn't
do his homework.

32:36.080 --> 32:38.890
I'm just saying there's
no deal to make here.

32:39.680 --> 32:42.081
First you turn me down.
Now this.

32:42.160 --> 32:43.650
What's next?

32:43.720 --> 32:44.767
Third time?

32:45.080 --> 32:47.765
You gonna tell me that,
by the power vested in you,

32:47.840 --> 32:50.286
that there's something else
I ain't allowed to do?

32:51.480 --> 32:53.448
This is still America,
last time I checked

32:53.520 --> 32:55.010
the flagpole.

32:55.480 --> 32:58.484
What's next is entirely based

32:58.560 --> 33:00.881
on the next choice you make.

33:09.200 --> 33:12.010
I think I'll burn one
on the way out.

33:12.080 --> 33:13.570
Helps me think.

33:15.800 --> 33:16.961
You gonna haul me in?

33:17.280 --> 33:19.328
No, not for weed.

33:19.400 --> 33:21.084
I can assure you of that.

33:26.400 --> 33:27.765
Okay, then.

33:29.080 --> 33:30.570
I'll be seeing you.

33:37.720 --> 33:39.006
Okay.

33:39.680 --> 33:42.047
Heard this one back in the '90s.

33:43.880 --> 33:45.848
Bill Clinton and Hillary

33:45.960 --> 33:48.167
sneak away from
the Secret Service

33:48.240 --> 33:51.210
and go for a drive,
backwoods Arkansas.

33:51.280 --> 33:54.807
And they come
to a gasoline station,

33:55.480 --> 33:57.687
and Hillary recognizes
the attendant,

33:57.760 --> 34:00.286
saying that was her
boyfriend before Bill.

34:00.800 --> 34:03.849
And Bill laughs, saying...

34:04.120 --> 34:08.920
"Imagine where you would be
now if you married that guy."

34:09.000 --> 34:11.650
And Hillary, quick
as a minute, says“.

34:12.360 --> 34:16.409
"I would be married to the
President of the United States."

34:19.080 --> 34:20.730
That's funny.
No.

34:21.239 --> 34:23.083
That's Grady and me.

34:23.920 --> 34:27.163
He was the face,
and I got it done.

34:30.880 --> 34:34.646
Must be frustrating,
Grady getting all the glory.

34:34.760 --> 34:35.966
Well...

34:36.960 --> 34:40.442
Taking his partner as my lover
made it a little easier.

34:40.800 --> 34:41.801
Avery Markham.

34:41.880 --> 34:45.009
Best lover I had ever had.

34:45.080 --> 34:46.320
Still is.

34:46.960 --> 34:50.168
Nevertheless, I know
he ratted out Grady

34:50.239 --> 34:54.449
and was responsible for
all that ensued, down to

34:54.520 --> 34:58.366
me pulling vindictive, low class,
little stunts in a jewelry store.

35:00.040 --> 35:02.122
Smart of you, though,

35:02.840 --> 35:04.649
sleeping with him.

35:04.720 --> 35:06.449
Can't imagine he'd suspect

35:06.520 --> 35:09.285
the man trying to rob him is
the woman underneath him.

35:09.760 --> 35:11.489
Not always underneath him.

35:13.680 --> 35:17.002
Yeah, I doubt that his money is
gonna feel as good as he does,

35:17.080 --> 35:20.766
but I sure cannot wait
to get my hands on it.

35:21.840 --> 35:25.845
I mean, a man as much
as kills your husband,

35:25.920 --> 35:28.048
you got to do
something about it.

35:29.040 --> 35:30.690
He killed Grady?

35:31.720 --> 35:35.725
Well, the prison assholes claimed
it was suicide, but...

35:36.520 --> 35:40.889
There was a lot of Dixie Mafia
muscle inside at that time,

35:40.960 --> 35:43.645
and those guys know how to fix
a murder to look like suicide

35:43.720 --> 35:45.324
easy as baking a pie.

35:49.240 --> 35:50.605
Oh, my goodness.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.650
That's my massage.

35:54.840 --> 35:56.251
I guess you better go.

35:56.920 --> 35:57.967
Oh.

35:58.760 --> 35:59.841
Okay.

36:05.240 --> 36:07.447
Thank you for a...

36:09.520 --> 36:11.409
A very interesting day.

36:12.080 --> 36:13.320
Anytime.

36:14.440 --> 36:15.487
Hey.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.241
It sure was lucky the way that

36:20.320 --> 36:24.530
guard of yours, the one
who said you stabbed him,

36:24.600 --> 36:28.366
how fortunate that he came
clean the way he did.

36:30.160 --> 36:32.322
What was his name? Uh...

36:32.400 --> 36:34.562
Albert Fekus?

36:34.640 --> 36:36.563
You ever thought about
thanking him?

36:38.160 --> 36:40.686
The guy was a crazy
piece of shit.

36:40.800 --> 36:42.529
All he did was finally
tell the truth.

36:42.600 --> 36:44.523
Yeah, but...

36:44.600 --> 36:47.922
Something made him step up

36:48.000 --> 36:50.446
and do the right thing, so...

36:51.920 --> 36:55.925
You know, if you ever want to get to the
bottom of his crisis of conscience,

36:56.000 --> 36:58.128
I could find him for you.

36:58.200 --> 36:59.770
It would be a breeze.

37:00.200 --> 37:02.248
Mmm.
That's so kind of you.

37:04.120 --> 37:06.805
But I'd probably just
stab him in the eye.

37:09.320 --> 37:10.970
You really are a firecracker.

37:20.840 --> 37:22.365
<i>Stop acting
like a badass</i>

37:22.440 --> 37:23.805
older than you are.

37:23.880 --> 37:25.689
Well, stop acting like my daddy.

37:25.760 --> 37:27.842
You're a kid.
Enjoy it.

37:28.120 --> 37:31.283
No need to take over the goddamn
world with your ambition.

37:31.360 --> 37:33.044
I don't even know how you're
thinking on this scale.

37:33.120 --> 37:35.885
What am I, stupid?
Look around.

37:35.960 --> 37:38.804
Five years, not even, it'll
be legal across the land.

37:38.880 --> 37:40.928
Oh, don't give me that bullshit.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.207
You're gonna sell dope
whether it's legal or not.

37:43.320 --> 37:44.970
But you set your sights
this high,

37:45.040 --> 37:46.840
you're gonna keep running
into folks like him.

37:46.880 --> 37:49.008
Is that what your daddy
would want?

37:53.200 --> 37:54.406
You didn't know him.

37:54.680 --> 37:56.170
Well, I know what
all daddies want.

37:56.240 --> 37:57.685
They want their kids to be safe.

38:00.040 --> 38:02.327
So, you're saying
walk away from weed?

38:02.400 --> 38:03.401
Look.

38:03.680 --> 38:05.569
It's good that you have goals.

38:05.880 --> 38:07.962
But for me, next couple weeks,

38:08.040 --> 38:10.611
just put two big guys out front.

38:11.040 --> 38:13.281
Help me sleep at night?

38:14.880 --> 38:16.370
Thanks for the heart to heart.

38:16.480 --> 38:18.244
Really changed my mind.
We done?

38:18.320 --> 38:21.051
Hmm'?
Uh, No.

38:21.520 --> 38:22.726
Loretta.

38:26.400 --> 38:27.481
God damn it.

38:28.400 --> 38:29.640
You mean to send three 5's?

38:29.720 --> 38:31.040
'Cause that's the
bat signal, Ava.

38:31.120 --> 38:33.240
That's what you send when a
grenade's about to go off.

38:33.280 --> 38:34.611
<i>Albert Fekus.</i>

38:34.840 --> 38:36.729
<i>What?</i>
She asked me about Fekus.

38:36.840 --> 38:38.683
You need to slow down.

38:39.200 --> 38:43.569
Katherine Hale asked me about
Albert Fekus, the guard!

38:43.640 --> 38:45.840
<i>The little shithead!</i> How the
hell did that even come up?

38:45.880 --> 38:47.370
Out of literally
goddamn nowhere.

38:47.440 --> 38:50.523
She just started asking why he
had a "crisis of conscience,"

38:50.640 --> 38:52.290
<i>why he changed his testimony.</i>

38:52.400 --> 38:55.882
Okay, at best, she's just testing you.
<i>I'm telling you...</i>

38:56.400 --> 38:57.845
She knows.
No.

38:57.920 --> 38:59.524
Trust me, she does not know.

38:59.800 --> 39:00.847
Why?

39:00.920 --> 39:04.003
Because she didn't put a bullet
in my head right then and there?

39:04.080 --> 39:06.128
Jesus Christ,
I have to get out of here.

39:06.200 --> 39:07.281
Where are you right now?

39:07.520 --> 39:09.090
I'm still in the hotel.
Okay.

39:09.200 --> 39:11.521
I want you to go down
to the Horseshoe Diner.

39:11.600 --> 39:13.520
Wait there. I'm gonna have
someone come meet you.

39:13.760 --> 39:15.205
Get where'?
<i>The Horseshoe Diner.</i>

39:15.280 --> 39:16.406
Shit.

39:16.560 --> 39:17.607
Ava?

39:21.120 --> 39:22.451
Hey, baby.

39:23.280 --> 39:24.327
Hey.

39:25.120 --> 39:26.929
You packing already?

39:27.440 --> 39:29.044
Thought I'd get a jump on it.

39:29.800 --> 39:32.087
We're heading home
tonight, right?

39:32.160 --> 39:33.730
Well, when they say
late checkout,

39:33.800 --> 39:35.689
I don't think they mean
10:00 at night.

39:37.440 --> 39:39.090
Are you sure

39:40.000 --> 39:44.369
you don't want to crawl
into this Egyptian cotton,

39:44.960 --> 39:47.531
order a pint of ice cream?

39:48.000 --> 39:49.445
Come on, now.

39:49.520 --> 39:50.965
They got free cable.

39:52.960 --> 39:55.566
I think I just want to get home,

39:55.640 --> 39:58.246
sleep in my...
In our own bed.

40:01.320 --> 40:02.651
All right.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.445
You Okay?

40:06.520 --> 40:08.648
Yeah, I'm fine.

40:08.760 --> 40:11.366
Duffy said that

40:11.440 --> 40:14.046
Katherine Hale wanted to
have lunch with you today.

40:14.280 --> 40:16.681
What did you two talk about?

40:16.760 --> 40:18.603
Mmm. Nothing.

40:18.680 --> 40:20.011
Nothing?

40:20.080 --> 40:21.923
Why, I didn't think it was
possible for two women

40:22.000 --> 40:23.604
to get together
and talk about nothing.

40:23.680 --> 40:25.808
She didn't talk about me?

40:25.880 --> 40:26.927
No.

40:27.360 --> 40:29.442
She didn't even bring up
how good-looking I am?

40:29.720 --> 40:31.245
No. She ju...

40:32.120 --> 40:33.451
We just had lunch.

40:33.720 --> 40:35.927
Well, I guess she was just

40:36.000 --> 40:39.209
looking forward to enjoying
the pleasure of your company.

40:40.040 --> 40:42.611
I can't say that I blame her.

40:42.680 --> 40:45.331
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

40:45.400 --> 40:46.731
Come here.

40:46.840 --> 40:48.330
Sit right here.

40:51.440 --> 40:53.329
Let me see them hands.

41:01.160 --> 41:02.366
Boyd, there's something that

41:03.200 --> 41:04.645
I need to talk to you about.

41:04.720 --> 41:07.200
Baby, I know what
you're gonna say.

41:07.600 --> 41:11.047
But before you do, I want to
tell you something first.

41:12.480 --> 41:14.767
I'm taking you home,

41:14.840 --> 41:17.571
and we never have to
leave Harlan County again.

41:17.680 --> 41:19.330
What do you mean?

41:20.160 --> 41:22.128
I got us a whole new endgame.

41:22.720 --> 41:24.768
Reason Markham's got that money

41:24.840 --> 41:28.401
he's looking to buy up land
to grow pot legally.

41:29.080 --> 41:31.040
Now, a man like him doesn't
make that kind of move

41:31.080 --> 41:33.321
unless he knows what's
coming around the corner.

41:33.400 --> 41:36.165
Now, I'm talking
about judges, baby.

41:36.240 --> 41:37.810
I'm talking about police.

41:37.880 --> 41:40.486
I'm talking about
State Senators.

41:40.600 --> 41:42.887
Now, I'm already on point
to steal his money.

41:42.960 --> 41:45.088
I'm gonna use it to
steal his idea, too.

41:45.200 --> 41:48.886
Boyd... Baby, legal weed
in the state of Kentucky.

41:50.920 --> 41:52.331
We're gonna make a killing.

41:52.720 --> 41:56.691
And we're gonna bring hope and prosperity
back to this beautiful county,

41:56.760 --> 41:59.684
our home, Harlan County,
once again.

41:59.960 --> 42:02.770
What happened to us
ending up on a beach?

42:03.240 --> 42:06.130
Come on, baby, you know how these
legs look in a bathing suit.

42:06.480 --> 42:07.766
Huh.

42:10.120 --> 42:12.441
We're gonna have it all, Ava,

42:12.520 --> 42:14.204
and we're gonna have it right
here in Harlan County.

42:14.280 --> 42:16.362
No running, no hiding.

42:17.720 --> 42:19.210
I don't know what to say.

42:19.280 --> 42:21.089
You ain't got to say anything.

42:22.040 --> 42:24.646
Now, I'm gonna take a shower.

42:24.720 --> 42:26.085
Then we're gonna hit the road,

42:26.160 --> 42:28.128
and I'm gonna have
you back in Harlan County

42:28.200 --> 42:29.770
before the sun comes up!

42:30.560 --> 42:31.971
Whoo!
