WEBVTT

00:33.072 --> 00:34.008
What?

00:34.108 --> 00:35.274
- We have pastelitos
in the oven.

00:35.374 --> 00:36.962
Another verse,
they might be flat.

00:37.062 --> 00:38.228
- Mm,
laugh now,

00:38.328 --> 00:39.878
but when I become rich
and famous,

00:39.978 --> 00:42.026
I want you to remember
this moment
and your lack of faith.

00:42.126 --> 00:44.596
- Who lacks faith?
Pay these when you hit it big.

00:44.696 --> 00:46.591
- Yeah.
You got the keys to the truck?

00:46.691 --> 00:48.126
- No, no, no, Daniel needs it
for the Connor wedding.

00:48.226 --> 00:50.144
- No, I'm making that delivery.

00:50.643 --> 00:51.847
- Pop, I told you.

00:51.947 --> 00:53.458
I'm taking Vanessa out
for our anniversary.

00:53.558 --> 00:56.758
- Mm, fourth anniversary.
Ask him where she's
making him go.

00:56.858 --> 00:58.139
Paolo's.

00:58.239 --> 01:00.057
Paolo's, the most expensive
place in Miami.

01:00.157 --> 01:01.822
Dinner there is like a weekend
at the Bahamas, right?

01:01.922 --> 01:03.740
- Vanessa Princessa, eh?

01:03.840 --> 01:06.234
She makes you take her
to dinners like this yet wonders
why you live at home.

01:06.334 --> 01:08.497
- Whoo!
- First of all,
she's not making me take her.

01:08.597 --> 01:10.953
Second, I live here because Mom
would have a heart attack

01:11.053 --> 01:12.449
if I moved out before
I was married.

01:12.549 --> 01:14.904
- You're getting married?
- No one is getting married.

01:15.004 --> 01:17.052
- Yeah, but you know
she's expecting a proposal
soon, right?

01:17.152 --> 01:19.738
Mom, that fan looks ridiculous.

01:19.838 --> 01:22.155
Besides, the AC's on fully.

01:22.255 --> 01:24.457
You know, who needs a fridge
when we can just leave
the milk out?

01:24.557 --> 01:25.684
It's only menopause.

01:25.784 --> 01:29.406
- I birth you,
I raise you,
I cook for you.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.424
I support every one

01:31.884 --> 01:34.700
I support every one
of your crazy dreams,
even this DJing thing,

01:34.800 --> 01:38.214
and in return when
my body's betraying me,
this is the thanks I get?

01:41.514 --> 01:42.948
- He's the one marrying
a lunatic.

01:43.048 --> 01:45.312
- I'm not getting married.
- They're right, Daniel.

01:45.887 --> 01:46.731
You can stick your head
in the sand,

01:46.808 --> 01:48.780
but a woman like Vanessa,

01:48.880 --> 01:50.161
pretty soon she's gonna
give you an ultimatum.

01:50.261 --> 01:51.619
- Now I have to hear it
from you too?

01:51.719 --> 01:52.961
- Well, I worry about you.

01:53.061 --> 01:54.573
- You are my little sister.

01:54.673 --> 01:55.839
It's my job to worry about you.

01:55.939 --> 01:57.373
- Natalie Garcia,

01:57.473 --> 01:58.662
what do you think you're doing
with that pricing gun?

01:58.739 --> 02:00.404
- Uh
- Is your homework done?

02:00.504 --> 02:03.128
- Yes.
- Calculus too?

02:03.228 --> 02:05.391
- Dad, give her a break.
She just wanted to help Mom.

02:05.491 --> 02:07.501
- She wants to help her mother,
she'll get into Princeton.

02:07.601 --> 02:09.687
We have already two idiotas
to take over the bakery.

02:09.788 --> 02:13.908
You are smart enough
to be President, eh?
Presidente.

02:14.008 --> 02:16.939
- Yo, how come she's always
the genius
and we're the idiotas?

02:17.039 --> 02:18.934
- This I ask myself every day.

02:19.034 --> 02:20.929
- Daniel, sing with me.
Everybody, sing with me.

02:24.865 --> 02:27.259
- I know you all think
Vanessa's a bit much,

02:27.359 --> 02:30.175
but she's driven, and that's one
of the things I love about her.

02:30.275 --> 02:32.208
She's smart, ambitious,
and yes,

02:32.308 --> 02:34.625
one day she might be my wife.

02:34.725 --> 02:36.543
But honestly,
tonight is just dinner.

02:37.679 --> 02:39.113
- Noa, over here!

02:39.213 --> 02:40.763
Did he cheat on you?
- Are you speaking to him?

02:40.863 --> 02:43.410
- Just when I think
you've hit rock bottom,
you start digging.

02:43.510 --> 02:46.249
- First up, the news breaking
the Internet today.

02:46.349 --> 02:49.702
Reports are Noa Hamilton,
the model turned fashion mogul,

02:49.802 --> 02:53.385
and Colin Davis,
the actor recently chosen
to be the next Batman,

02:53.485 --> 02:55.457
have broken up.
- Oh, my God.

02:55.557 --> 02:58.104
- This coming only days
after photos surface

02:58.204 --> 03:00.175
of Colin
getting a little too cozy

03:00.275 --> 03:02.669
with the costar of his most
recent film, "Red Line."

03:02.769 --> 03:04.741
- Ooh!
- What a jerk.

03:04.841 --> 03:06.352
- Aye, cry me a river.

03:06.452 --> 03:07.656
- But Ma
- Por favor.

03:07.756 --> 03:08.769
Her father's a billionaire.

03:08.869 --> 03:10.572
She never worked a hard day
in her life.

03:10.672 --> 03:12.912
- She started her own
fashion label when she was 16

03:13.012 --> 03:15.176
and her own cosmetics line
at 18.

03:15.276 --> 03:19.242
Plus, her YouTube channel,
50 million subscribers.

03:19.342 --> 03:20.777
I followed when there
were only 30.

03:20.877 --> 03:23.731
- Now, no comment from Noa
on the breakup just yet,

03:23.831 --> 03:28.450
but the Australian entrepreneur
was all smiles last night
at a fundraiser in New York.

03:30.276 --> 03:32.708
- That's exactly how
your mom looked the day we met.

03:57.591 --> 03:58.566
- In addition
to those selections,

03:58.666 --> 04:00.522
we have our
inspirational tasting

04:00.622 --> 04:03.591
where Paolo channels
his energies into a unique
dining experience for two.

04:03.691 --> 04:06.008
- That's $300 per person.

04:06.108 --> 04:08.425
- We'll do that.
- Give us a minute.

04:08.525 --> 04:10.343
- Yes, perhaps a minute.
Thank you.

04:14.203 --> 04:17.019
It's like a dream come true.

04:17.119 --> 04:19.358
- Happy anniversary.

04:19.459 --> 04:20.740
You look so handsome.

04:23.027 --> 04:24.308
So did you look
at the house I sent you?

04:24.408 --> 04:26.073
- Mm-hmm.
- And?

04:26.173 --> 04:27.991
- You're the expert.
- Okay.

04:28.091 --> 04:29.372
I know it doesn't seem
like a lot,

04:29.472 --> 04:30.983
but I've sold four homes
in that neighborhood this month.

04:31.083 --> 04:32.863
It's the next Little Haiti.
- Mm.

04:32.963 --> 04:35.395
- I know it's small
and I know it's a wreck,
but we can fix it up.

04:35.495 --> 04:38.196
Think about it.
A place of our own.

04:38.296 --> 04:40.383
For our future.

04:40.483 --> 04:42.186
It's even got room
for a nursery.

04:44.588 --> 04:46.176
- Have you decided?

04:46.276 --> 04:47.518
- Actually, could you direct me
to the restroom?

04:47.618 --> 04:48.861
- Right this way.

04:48.961 --> 04:50.242
- Be right back.

05:07.031 --> 05:10.292
Turn around.
Can't go with you staring.

05:14.435 --> 05:18.440
Mateo's right.
You heard her out there.

05:18.540 --> 05:22.238
Thing is, I feel like if I don't
propose soon, I'm screwed.

05:22.338 --> 05:24.908
At the same time I feel like
if I do propose soon,
I'm screwed.

05:26.596 --> 05:28.937
I must sound so crazy.

05:49.385 --> 05:51.510
- You know, if you have
to talk yourself into something,

05:51.610 --> 05:54.464
maybe you should
just stop talking.

05:54.564 --> 05:57.456
- Excuse me?

05:57.556 --> 05:59.566
- You didn't seem like you were
making a lot of headway.

06:02.122 --> 06:05.244
- Oh, you mean when I was on
the phone talking to my brother.

06:05.344 --> 06:08.030
- No, I mean when you were
talking to the picture
while you peed.

06:11.291 --> 06:13.109
- You should see what I do
in the shower.

06:13.209 --> 06:15.027
I hold conference calls
with the U.N.

06:15.127 --> 06:18.403
When I really want a challenge,
I'll do it in Japanese.

06:22.877 --> 06:24.541
- Oh, come on.

06:27.519 --> 06:32.138
- First time here?
Try the soup.
Everything else here sucks.

06:39.105 --> 06:40.654
- How's the soup?

06:40.754 --> 06:42.918
Daniel.
How's the soup?

06:43.018 --> 06:44.606
- It's good.
- Mm.

06:44.706 --> 06:48.596
- How's your
- Oh, it's wonderful.
Everything is wonderful.

06:53.415 --> 06:54.926
- Do you remember
our first date?

06:55.026 --> 06:56.959
You took me to that little
topless bar on 8th

06:57.059 --> 06:58.839
and then we went dancing?

06:58.939 --> 07:00.911
- Yeah.
How come we don't dance anymore?

07:01.011 --> 07:04.133
- I was waiting all night
for you to kiss me.

07:04.233 --> 07:06.473
Finally I couldn't wait
any longer,
so I just grabbed you.

07:06.573 --> 07:08.952
- Even back then,
when you wanted something,
you went right after it.

07:10.563 --> 07:12.995
- You like that about me, right?

07:13.095 --> 07:14.837
- Sure.
Why?

07:14.937 --> 07:16.947
- This is why.

07:22.034 --> 07:24.313
May I please have
everyone's attention?

07:24.413 --> 07:26.331
- Vanessa, what are you doing?

07:27.904 --> 07:31.640
- Tonight marks four years,
four days, and one hour

07:31.740 --> 07:35.692
since Daniel and I fell
in love at first sight.

07:36.958 --> 07:39.582
Aww, he's shy.
It's one of the things
I love about him.

07:39.682 --> 07:43.380
Anyway, he's always teasing me
about being larger than life,

07:43.480 --> 07:47.753
so when he told me we were
coming here to this
amazing restaurant,

07:47.853 --> 07:50.078
I thought,
"What better place than this?"

08:33.277 --> 08:38.010
Daniel,
light of my life,

08:38.110 --> 08:39.429
will you marry me?

08:51.001 --> 08:52.919
- Daniel.

08:53.878 --> 08:55.159
- Sit down, okay?

08:55.259 --> 08:58.152
- Once you say yes
and put the ring on my finger.

09:01.398 --> 09:03.599
- I don't wanna answer you
here like this.

09:03.699 --> 09:06.477
- Then just give me
a temporary yes
and we'll talk about it later.

09:13.712 --> 09:15.492
- Say yes.

09:19.467 --> 09:20.940
- No.

09:22.728 --> 09:24.163
- That's a million views
on YouTube.

09:24.263 --> 09:26.181
- Lewis, put the phone away.

09:31.398 --> 09:33.317
- Vanessa...

09:34.889 --> 09:36.746
Wait, hang on.
I'll get the check.

09:36.846 --> 09:39.662
- Get the check?
Four years, Daniel.

09:39.762 --> 09:40.966
We've been together four years.

09:41.066 --> 09:42.083
What have you been doing
all this time

09:42.179 --> 09:43.613
if you were just gonna say no?

09:43.713 --> 09:45.647
- I didn't know, I was
- I'm a woman, Daniel.

09:45.747 --> 09:48.639
I'm a 28-year-old woman.
This is what we do.

09:48.739 --> 09:50.964
We diet, we get married,
we have kids,
and we diet again.

09:51.655 --> 09:53.665
Look at what I did
for you tonight.

09:53.765 --> 09:55.683
Look how much I love you.

09:58.023 --> 09:59.941
Is a yes too much?

10:11.527 --> 10:14.343
- Everyone, my name
is Vanessa Sanchez.

10:14.443 --> 10:17.604
I can cook,
I have my own business,
and as of this moment,

10:17.704 --> 10:20.942
I am officially single.

10:21.042 --> 10:22.476
- Ooh.

10:22.576 --> 10:24.126
- Google me
if you're interested.

10:26.106 --> 10:28.423
- Good for her.
- I'm gonna Google her.

10:38.114 --> 10:39.510
I keep calling,
but she's not answering.

10:39.610 --> 10:41.006
- Of course not, bro.

10:41.106 --> 10:42.963
I mean, you dropped
a nuclear bomb on her head.

10:43.063 --> 10:44.919
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I'm really proud of you.

10:45.019 --> 10:47.858
I'd never think
of having the balls
to crush her like that.

10:48.856 --> 10:49.983
- How soon can you pick me up?

10:50.083 --> 10:52.439
- Uh, Daniel, uh,

10:52.539 --> 10:54.280
this is a pretty big gig,
and it's about to start.

10:54.380 --> 10:55.661
Or did you forget?

10:55.761 --> 10:57.771
- I'm broke,
I'm soaked,

10:57.871 --> 10:59.382
I'm probably single,
and now I'm gonna have
to walk home.

10:59.482 --> 11:00.687
Is that what you're telling me?

11:00.787 --> 11:03.703
- Well, you know,
at least it's a nice night.

11:10.340 --> 11:12.081
- What is up, mi gente?

11:12.181 --> 11:17.183
I'm MC Cubano,
and let's get
this party started!

11:17.283 --> 11:19.984
All right, Deering High School.
Let's dance!

11:20.084 --> 11:22.132
- Kill me now.
- Pump it up!

11:22.232 --> 11:24.319
Pump it up!
Pump it up!

11:30.673 --> 11:32.030
- Slow down.
- Are you serious?
You want me to slow down?

11:32.130 --> 11:35.752
- Hey.
You want a ride?

11:35.852 --> 11:37.593
Come on.
It's the least I can do.

11:37.693 --> 11:39.895
After all,
I feel kind of responsible.

11:39.995 --> 11:42.105
I did tell you to get the soup.

11:43.947 --> 11:46.264
- No, the soup was good,
actually.
I'm taking some home.

11:46.364 --> 11:47.952
- Let me take you home.

11:48.052 --> 11:50.560
- Oh, here we go.
- I meant to his home.

11:50.660 --> 11:52.517
- Hamilton, are you serious?
I mean, come on.

11:52.617 --> 11:53.936
- What do you say?

11:54.036 --> 11:55.624
In ten seconds,
TMZ's gonna be all over us,

11:55.724 --> 11:58.732
so are you in or are you out?

12:08.807 --> 12:12.006
- So, Daniel,
this is Piper, my best friend,

12:12.106 --> 12:13.886
my stylist Zoe,

12:13.986 --> 12:17.876
and this rude man is my manager,
Lewis.

12:17.976 --> 12:21.712
Ladies, Daniel's
had a really hard night.

12:21.812 --> 12:24.014
I think we should cheer him up,
right?

12:24.114 --> 12:26.032
What do you wanna do?

12:26.646 --> 12:28.771
Anything.
Sky's the limit.
You wanna go somewhere?

12:28.871 --> 12:31.303
- How 'bout Bermuda?
- We just flew here.

12:31.403 --> 12:32.953
- You are so...
-  Stop!

12:33.053 --> 12:35.753
- I have to work in the morning.
- Relax, Cinderella.

12:35.853 --> 12:38.017
I'll have you home before
you turn into a pumpkin.

12:38.117 --> 12:41.585
What do you wanna do more than
anything in the whole world?

12:43.795 --> 12:45.958
- Change my shirt.
- Practical man.

12:46.058 --> 12:47.454
How refreshing.

12:47.554 --> 12:49.948
- Lewis, can I please
have your shirt?

12:50.048 --> 12:51.368
- Uh, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

12:51.468 --> 12:52.365
I beg your pardon?

12:52.465 --> 12:53.746
- I know that you're
wearing layers.

12:53.846 --> 12:54.782
- This is Gucci.

12:54.882 --> 12:57.429
- Please?
-  All right.

12:57.529 --> 12:59.884
If you ever question
how much I love you, Hamilton,

12:59.984 --> 13:02.340
I am going to remind you
of this moment.

13:02.440 --> 13:03.606
- I'm so grateful.

13:03.706 --> 13:05.754
- This is cashmere.

13:05.854 --> 13:07.327
- You're such a snob.

13:11.379 --> 13:13.043
- Is that making
you uncomfortable?
We can look away.

13:13.143 --> 13:15.384
Girls, look away.
- No, I'm gonna keep looking.

13:15.484 --> 13:17.455
- Wow.
- Keep your eyes on the road,
honestly.

13:17.555 --> 13:19.642
- Keep your eyes forward too.

13:19.742 --> 13:21.483
- Thank you.

13:21.583 --> 13:25.627
- Okay,
that was your first wish.
A shirt.

13:25.727 --> 13:29.924
Now, I'm gonna ask you what
you want for your second wish,
but before that,

13:30.024 --> 13:31.497
I really need your help
with something.

13:31.597 --> 13:34.681
- I'm almost afraid to ask.
- Oh, he catches on quick.

13:34.781 --> 13:38.901
- With what?
- My mustache.

13:44.410 --> 13:46.382
- Long time.
Good to see you.

13:46.482 --> 13:47.609
Long time.

13:47.709 --> 13:50.142
And this is my new friend,
Daniel.

13:50.242 --> 13:51.066
- Daniel.
- Daniel, nice to meet you.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.605
Nice.
- Never looked better.

14:23.772 --> 14:25.513
- Point of no return, brother.

14:28.376 --> 14:30.961
- Hey, can I get you anything?

14:31.061 --> 14:32.457
- You mean like a gun?

14:32.557 --> 14:34.299
One of those little
kitchen knives

14:34.399 --> 14:36.716
chefs use to dice up carrots
into tiny slices?

14:45.831 --> 14:49.453
Okay.

14:49.553 --> 14:51.678
Maybe I'm overreacting.

14:51.778 --> 14:55.361
In fairness, my proposal
was more sort of my thing
than his.

14:55.461 --> 14:57.279
I spooked him.

14:57.379 --> 14:58.890
Plus he's Cuban,
so he has that whole
macho thing.

14:58.990 --> 15:00.732
- Yes, yes, he does.

15:00.832 --> 15:04.415
- Maybe I overstepped
in depriving him
the chance to ask me?

15:04.515 --> 15:05.872
I mean, I know he loves me.

15:05.972 --> 15:07.522
He said he loved the idea
of the house.

15:07.622 --> 15:09.939
He even said he wanted me
to go dancing more,

15:10.039 --> 15:12.509
and everyone knows dancing
is just a metaphor for sex.

15:12.609 --> 15:16.192
- After four years
to still have all that passion,
that is incredible.

15:16.292 --> 15:18.034
- Right?

15:18.134 --> 15:20.758
Oh, I'm so dramatic,
aren't I?

15:20.858 --> 15:23.597
- The greats always are.
- Oh!

15:23.697 --> 15:25.438
Poor Daniel.

15:25.538 --> 15:29.006
He's probably curled up
somewhere scared to death
he's lost me forever.

15:32.827 --> 15:35.259
Hey. You doing okay?

15:35.359 --> 15:39.211
- Is this a typical night?
- Uh, with Noa,
there's no such thing.

15:39.311 --> 15:41.628
Well, it's her father's hotel,
and he used her image
without her approval,

15:41.728 --> 15:45.272
so we're turning it into
an image she does approve of.

15:45.372 --> 15:47.651
- That's right.
Come down.

15:53.237 --> 15:55.247
Are you happy you got
in the car?

15:55.347 --> 15:58.071
Ask me when I'm back on Earth.

15:59.299 --> 16:01.769
Should I worry that you feel
the need to deface yourself?

16:01.869 --> 16:03.189
- Should I worry
that when I told you

16:03.289 --> 16:04.761
you could do
anything you want,

16:04.861 --> 16:08.022
the best you could come up with
was change your shirt?

16:08.122 --> 16:10.194
- Yeah, but it is a nice shirt.

16:14.376 --> 16:17.115
- This is the Gordon hotel,
right?
- Yeah.

16:17.215 --> 16:20.261
- There's a wedding down there.
My family made the pastries
for it.

16:23.161 --> 16:26.130
- You're a baker?
- My dad has a place
in Little Havana.

16:26.230 --> 16:29.391
Rafael's,
but we all work there.

16:29.491 --> 16:31.540
- Who's we?

16:31.640 --> 16:34.532
- Me, my brother,
my sister,
and my parents.

16:34.632 --> 16:36.796
- Are you all close?

16:36.896 --> 16:39.941
- Sometimes maybe too close.
What about you?

16:46.141 --> 16:50.607
- Are you turning my mustache
into a butterfly?

16:50.707 --> 16:52.410
That's amazing.

16:54.236 --> 16:56.054
- I like to paint.

16:56.154 --> 16:58.740
- Full of surprises.

17:21.244 --> 17:23.163
- I know.

18:01.143 --> 18:03.614
- Aye, uh-oh.
Aye, Papa.

18:03.714 --> 18:05.532
That's the home phone.
It must be one of the kids.

18:05.632 --> 18:07.412
Hello?
Is everything all right?

18:07.512 --> 18:09.829
- Mari, it's Vanessa.

18:09.929 --> 18:12.246
I'm sorry to disturb you but I
was hoping to talk to Daniel.

18:12.346 --> 18:16.005
- Isn't he with you?
- No.

18:16.105 --> 18:19.880
So you haven't heard from him
about anything, then?

18:19.980 --> 18:21.185
- Why?
Is something wrong?

18:21.285 --> 18:22.144
- Que paso?
Baby, que paso?

18:22.244 --> 18:25.712
- No.
I

18:25.812 --> 18:28.282
I wasn't feeling well
so I asked him to take me home.

18:28.382 --> 18:30.584
I just wanted to let him know
my fever broke,
but his phone is off.

18:30.684 --> 18:32.602
Anyway, gotta go.
Bye.

18:35.441 --> 18:37.144
Get ready.

18:46.682 --> 18:48.960
- Um, you're
you're Natalie, right?

18:50.058 --> 18:52.566
- Yeah, yeah.
Why?

18:52.666 --> 18:54.485
- Just someone said that DJ's
your brother.

18:58.153 --> 19:00.891
- Oh.

19:00.991 --> 19:02.886
I do

19:02.986 --> 19:05.073
No. What?
No.

19:05.173 --> 19:06.262
No, he's not.

19:08.357 --> 19:10.483
- Mom?
- Have you talked
to your brother?

19:10.583 --> 19:12.861
I've been trying to call,
and he's not answering the phone

19:12.961 --> 19:14.434
and Vanessa called here
sounding very strange.

19:14.534 --> 19:15.854
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He's fine.

19:15.954 --> 19:17.618
She proposed to him
and he told her no.

19:17.718 --> 19:20.265
- She proposed and he said no?

19:20.365 --> 19:22.284
And you didn't think to call me?
Mateo...

19:23.588 --> 19:25.368
- Okay, Mom, Mami, relax.
Listen.

19:25.468 --> 19:27.708
I'll find him and I'll tell him
to call you, okay?

19:33.754 --> 19:35.343
- Bro, where are you?

19:35.443 --> 19:36.877
Mom's worried
you're gonna kill yourself.

19:36.977 --> 19:38.910
- You're not gonna believe this.

19:39.010 --> 19:40.483
I'm hanging off of the side
of a building.

19:40.583 --> 19:41.903
I'm with Noa Hamilton.

19:42.003 --> 19:43.246
She was at the restaurant.

19:43.346 --> 19:44.972
We met in the bathroom,
and now I'm at the Gordon Hotel

19:45.072 --> 19:46.698
painting over
a giant picture of her.

19:46.798 --> 19:47.964
- Daniel, Daniel,
I know you're mad at me

19:48.064 --> 19:48.908
for not picking you up,
all right?

19:48.985 --> 19:50.727
So fine.
I'm sorry.

19:50.827 --> 19:53.128
I'll let Mom know
that you're okay.

19:54.049 --> 19:56.289
- Hello?
- Hey, Noa, hurry up!
You wanna get caught?

19:56.389 --> 19:58.399
There's a crowd gathering.

19:58.499 --> 20:00.011
Let's go.

20:13.193 --> 20:14.973
- Yeah, yeah.
- Do you like it so far?

20:15.073 --> 20:17.812
- Honestly, no.

20:17.912 --> 20:20.382
I haven't really gotten time to,
like, know anyone, so...

20:20.482 --> 20:21.495
- Yo, I need your help.

20:23.896 --> 20:27.019
- Natalie.
Natalie.

20:27.119 --> 20:29.037
If you keep ignoring me,
I'm gonna stand here all night.

20:31.493 --> 20:34.385
Yo, you know everything
about Noa Hamilton, right?

20:34.485 --> 20:35.613
Yes, yeah.
Why?

20:35.713 --> 20:37.070
- Do you know if she's in town?

20:37.170 --> 20:40.447
- Let me just check her tracker.
No, Matehey!

20:45.035 --> 20:46.968
- Holy mother of mothers.

20:47.068 --> 20:50.153
- I'm telling mom you did this.
- You do that!

20:58.654 --> 21:01.815
- It was her.
I have photos.
- Yo, let me see that.

21:01.915 --> 21:04.463
- Can I s
I wanna see that.
Just an emergency, I'm sorry.

21:10.586 --> 21:12.442
You wouldn't happen
to know where they went, huh?

21:12.542 --> 21:14.015
- No.

21:18.527 --> 21:19.923
- Is this Julio Z's new place?

21:20.023 --> 21:21.688
- You said you were hungry.
- Don't fight it.

21:21.788 --> 21:24.450
- And here's Julio.

21:24.550 --> 21:25.985
- How are you, gorgeous?
- You're a lifesaver.

21:26.085 --> 21:27.826
- Yeah, don't worry.
Go right in. Hey.

21:36.366 --> 21:38.285
- You wanna talk about it?

21:38.898 --> 21:41.599
- No.
- Hey. It's me.

21:41.699 --> 21:47.339
I know the difference between
hurt Noa and really hurt Noa.

21:49.103 --> 21:51.919
Okay, fine.

21:52.019 --> 21:54.911
But what are we doing
with baker boy over there?

21:55.011 --> 21:56.369
- We're having fun.

21:56.469 --> 21:58.211
- Yeah, and when he sells
his story to "The Enquirer"?

21:58.311 --> 22:01.050
- You're so paranoid.
- So you don't have to be.

22:01.150 --> 22:02.699
- Should I just cry myself
to sleep?

22:02.799 --> 22:05.308
- These are my options?

22:05.408 --> 22:08.416
Look, when the time comes,

22:08.516 --> 22:10.602
you tell me
and I'll take care of it, okay?

22:10.702 --> 22:12.175
Oh.

22:12.275 --> 22:14.899
Roger, hey.

22:14.999 --> 22:17.470
How would you like an exclusive?

22:17.570 --> 22:19.733
She'll tell her side
of the breakup,

22:19.833 --> 22:23.493
and you get to write
about all the girls' schools
she's funding around the world.

22:28.849 --> 22:30.322
- Leave any room for dessert?

22:30.422 --> 22:33.429
- Actually, Daniel here's
a baker, and I was thinking

22:33.529 --> 22:35.769
he could maybe make something
in your kitchen?

22:35.869 --> 22:38.838
- Noa, please.
You don't ask a chef
- By all means.

22:38.938 --> 22:40.948
Any friend of Noa
is a friend of mine.

22:41.048 --> 22:42.982
- Let's see what you got.

22:55.934 --> 22:58.021
- What?
What's that look?

22:58.121 --> 23:00.859
- This is my supportive face.

23:00.959 --> 23:03.468
Really.

23:03.568 --> 23:06.154
All right, you wanna roll it,
not kill it.

23:06.254 --> 23:07.190
Here, let me show you.

23:07.290 --> 23:08.954
So, see?

23:09.054 --> 23:10.988
You just want to give it
a little muscle,

23:11.088 --> 23:13.520
especially on the edges.
See?

23:13.620 --> 23:15.054
I'll flip it for you, okay?

23:17.072 --> 23:19.044
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- You know,
just, like, make it rain.

23:19.144 --> 23:20.233
There you go.
- Okay.

23:20.333 --> 23:21.653
- There it is.
There it is.

23:21.753 --> 23:25.182
- Too much guava.
Too much guava?

23:25.282 --> 23:27.714
- Yes.

23:31.114 --> 23:35.042
How come you're spotless
and I look like a crime scene?

23:37.099 --> 23:39.070
- You should not
be hard on yourself.

23:39.170 --> 23:41.295
Honestly, you've definitely
shown me something.

23:41.395 --> 23:42.370
- What?

23:42.470 --> 23:43.712
- Most people,

23:43.812 --> 23:45.439
when you ask them
to do something new,

23:45.539 --> 23:47.050
something you know
nothing about,

23:47.150 --> 23:50.426
and they're totally afraid
to look foolish.

23:50.526 --> 23:52.905
But you
- Careful.

23:55.820 --> 23:57.638
- You're fearless.

24:01.613 --> 24:02.933
- Thank you.

24:12.701 --> 24:17.012
- Mmm-mmm.
- Mmm.

24:17.112 --> 24:19.007
Mmm.

24:19.107 --> 24:21.539
- No, no.
We gotta let them cool off.

24:21.639 --> 24:24.133
- What are we supposed
to do until then?
- We clean.

24:25.437 --> 24:27.294
I know where you should start.

24:27.394 --> 24:28.944
- Oh, really?

24:29.044 --> 24:30.708
Oh, careful.
This is Gucci.

24:30.808 --> 24:32.473
- Oh, yeah?
You haven't heard?

24:32.573 --> 24:34.468
I'm known to spill things.

24:34.568 --> 24:36.808
- Seems that word
of our little feast
has gotten out,

24:36.908 --> 24:40.491
so either you two wrap up
the Great Miami Bake-Off,

24:40.591 --> 24:43.292
or Julio winds up
with 100 customers
he does not want.

24:43.392 --> 24:44.443
All right?

24:46.960 --> 24:50.006
- Oh, my God.
This is amazing.

24:51.985 --> 24:53.689
- 24 hours a day they're glued
to their phone,

24:53.789 --> 24:56.029
and now when there's
a real emergency, nothing.

24:56.129 --> 24:58.369
- He's fine.
- Aye.

24:58.469 --> 25:01.438
- They're all fine.
- I can't believe she proposed.

25:01.538 --> 25:02.704
I mean,
I can believe she proposed.

25:02.804 --> 25:04.929
I just can't believe
he said no.

25:05.029 --> 25:07.154
- And how do we feel about that?

25:07.254 --> 25:09.495
- Relieved!
- Ah.

25:09.595 --> 25:10.876
Aye, please.

25:10.976 --> 25:12.027
I mean,
she had her good qualities,

25:12.127 --> 25:14.252
but he could do
way better than that.

25:14.352 --> 25:17.129
- Vanessa was easy to tease,

25:17.229 --> 25:19.239
but I'm not so sure
she'll be easy to replace.

25:23.099 --> 25:25.799
- Oh, it's you.

25:25.899 --> 25:28.293
- And you wonder why
I have self-esteem issues.

25:28.393 --> 25:32.091
- No, honey, I'm sorry.
It's just this night
has been crazy.

25:32.191 --> 25:36.503
- Yeah, I got that after Mateo
went running from the dance.

25:36.603 --> 25:38.843
'Cause it wasn't enough
that everyone at that school
thinks that I'm a freak

25:38.943 --> 25:40.646
or a charity case.
No.

25:40.746 --> 25:45.388
Now I'm also the sister
of MC Cubano!

25:59.430 --> 26:01.348
Go away.

26:04.302 --> 26:06.005
- Sorry.

26:06.105 --> 26:07.770
You didn't get the mom
that goes away.

26:07.870 --> 26:09.980
You got the mom that smothers.

26:11.821 --> 26:14.867
Sweetheart,
I'm not going to pretend

26:14.967 --> 26:17.092
to understand
what you're going through.

26:17.192 --> 26:20.277
A new school,
honors classes,

26:20.377 --> 26:22.847
but there is one thing
that I do know,

26:22.947 --> 26:24.957
and that is what it's like
to be 15

26:25.057 --> 26:26.975
dealing with teenage boys.

26:27.742 --> 26:30.903
Now, I know the church doesn't
approve of birth control,

26:31.003 --> 26:34.241
but there's nothing wrong with
a woman being prepared and

26:34.341 --> 26:37.234
- Yo, Natalie!
Are you here?
Where's my phone?

26:37.334 --> 26:38.139
- Oh, thank God.
- Do you have my phone?

26:38.216 --> 26:40.188
- Por que?
- Here.

26:40.288 --> 26:41.991
You're welcome.

26:42.091 --> 26:43.947
- Have you spoken to Daniel?

26:44.047 --> 26:45.674
- Can I get some privacy,
please?

26:45.774 --> 26:47.366
What's going on?
- I'm just checking my messages.

26:47.462 --> 26:48.781
- Well, is one of them
from Daniel?

26:48.881 --> 26:50.968
- Yeah, I just spoke
to him once briefly.
Um...

26:51.068 --> 26:52.848
- And?
- Okay.

26:52.948 --> 26:57.260
I, umI need to figure out
how to present
this information to you.

26:57.360 --> 27:00.712
- Oh, my God.
- Words.
Use words.

27:00.812 --> 27:02.976
- Okay.

27:03.076 --> 27:06.659
As you know,
Vanessa proposed tonight.

27:06.759 --> 27:09.306
And as you know,
Daniel said no.

27:09.406 --> 27:11.071
- Mateo, I swear to God,

27:11.171 --> 27:12.414
if you don't start
saying something new,

27:12.514 --> 27:14.739
I'm gonna shove this fan
down your throat.

27:16.695 --> 27:17.976
- I have reason to believe...

27:24.368 --> 27:26.915
Based on compelling
circumstantial evidence...

27:27.015 --> 27:28.933
- One.

27:29.969 --> 27:31.557
- Where's Daniel?

27:31.657 --> 27:33.245
- That Daniel...

27:39.445 --> 27:43.143
Is out with Noa Hamilton.

27:43.243 --> 27:45.161
- What?

27:49.803 --> 27:51.698
- MamiMami, Papi, listen.
I know it sounds crazy, okay?

27:51.798 --> 27:53.271
But his story checks out.

27:53.371 --> 27:55.290
- Oh, my God.
He's right.

27:56.249 --> 27:58.167
Mateo's right.

28:03.154 --> 28:06.354
- Aye, dios mio.

28:06.454 --> 28:08.348
- Didn't I tell you?

28:08.448 --> 28:10.367
- Daniel.

28:10.827 --> 28:11.916
- That was Vanessa.

28:12.016 --> 28:13.144
- Daniel, are you home?

28:13.244 --> 28:15.024
- Vanessa.

28:15.124 --> 28:17.556
She's outside.
- No, no.

28:17.656 --> 28:18.438
- Daniel!
- Talk to her.

28:18.538 --> 28:19.397
- What do you mean?

28:21.109 --> 28:22.298
- I don't know Spanish.
What are you
what are you telling me?

28:22.375 --> 28:23.502
I'm not

28:26.710 --> 28:28.068
- Daniel, are you home?

28:31.505 --> 28:32.863
- Daniel!

28:32.963 --> 28:34.283
Mateo!

28:34.383 --> 28:36.354
- Hey, uh, just, uh,
keep it down, okay?

28:36.454 --> 28:39.692
- I need to talk to Daniel.
- Yeah, here's the thing.
He's asleep.

28:39.792 --> 28:42.669
- How can he sleep?
- Well, because he's upset.

28:43.744 --> 28:46.406
He's very, very, very upset.

28:46.506 --> 28:48.424
So, you know, I...

28:49.575 --> 28:54.117
Gave him some of the pills that
the doctor prescribed
for my mom's hot flashes.

28:54.217 --> 28:56.611
It knocked him right out, so
- Okay, Mateo, let me in, okay?

28:56.711 --> 28:59.718
Vanessa, I know you think you
need to charge in there
and talk to Daniel

28:59.818 --> 29:01.713
about his incredibly
stupid answer
and reaffirm your love,

29:01.813 --> 29:03.731
but you're wrong,
and I'll tell you why.

29:05.112 --> 29:07.031
- Why?

29:08.719 --> 29:11.189
- Because you did something
great for my brother.

29:11.289 --> 29:13.414
You did.

29:13.514 --> 29:18.248
Tonight you gave him a chance
to see what life
would be like without you.

29:18.348 --> 29:20.205
And as a result,

29:20.305 --> 29:24.310
the entire family's
spent half the night
worried sick about him.

29:26.213 --> 29:29.527
So go home,
get some rest,

29:29.627 --> 29:32.826
and when you both have had
the chance to, like,
sleep this crazy night off,

29:32.926 --> 29:34.898
then come back in the morning.

29:36.341 --> 29:38.811
Hey.

29:38.911 --> 29:40.269
Tomorrow's a new day.

29:45.165 --> 29:46.522
Okay?

30:16.662 --> 30:20.743
- That's Alexi Yevich.
He owns the place.

30:20.843 --> 30:22.853
But he's got nothing on you.

30:22.953 --> 30:24.119
Get down there.

31:31.894 --> 31:33.175
- I'm ready for my second wish.

31:35.347 --> 31:37.510
- Okay.

31:43.710 --> 31:46.295
- Tell me everything,
and don't skip
even a microsecond.

31:46.395 --> 31:48.981
- Well, we met
at the restaurant.

31:49.081 --> 31:50.324
Um...
- Ooh!

31:50.424 --> 31:53.416
- Caught him at a
a vulnerable moment.

31:55.104 --> 31:58.841
But there was something
about him, you know?

31:58.941 --> 32:01.910
- Oh, my God,
Miss Hamilton, you're

32:02.010 --> 32:04.825
I just think you're amazing
and really talented

32:04.925 --> 32:07.396
and an incredible role model.

32:07.496 --> 32:09.467
And Colin Davis is an ass.

32:09.567 --> 32:11.999
- So Daniel tells me that you're
starting at a new school.

32:12.099 --> 32:14.071
I know how hard that can be.

32:14.171 --> 32:16.642
I was always starting
at some new school,

32:16.742 --> 32:19.174
and I always had a tough time
making friends.

32:19.274 --> 32:20.670
- Really?
- Yeah.

32:20.770 --> 32:22.780
But it gets better,

32:22.880 --> 32:27.345
and if you're even half
as charming as your brother,
you'll be fine.

32:27.445 --> 32:31.066
- Okay, thank you.
Good-bye.
All right.

32:31.166 --> 32:32.793
Hey, how was the dance?

32:32.893 --> 32:35.325
- Don't talk to me.
Talk to her.

32:35.425 --> 32:37.343
She likes you.

32:42.407 --> 32:44.264
- Thank you.

32:44.364 --> 32:46.067
I'll be the cool brother
for months now.

32:48.047 --> 32:50.172
What?

32:50.272 --> 32:52.013
- All night,
my friends and I flirt with you,

32:52.113 --> 32:54.085
and then when I ask you
what your wish is,

32:54.185 --> 32:55.581
it's that I talk to your sister.

32:55.681 --> 32:58.075
- When you put it that way,
it sounds pretty bad.

32:58.175 --> 33:00.453
- No, I think it sounds great.

33:00.553 --> 33:03.062
When I asked my ex what
he wanted for his birthday,

33:03.162 --> 33:06.055
his wish was a threesome
with my best friend.

33:06.155 --> 33:07.743
- That's not cool.

33:07.843 --> 33:10.543
- I should have known better,
you know?

33:10.643 --> 33:14.840
But I just wanted to believe.

33:14.940 --> 33:18.216
Seemed so right
'cause he knew my world
and he knew what it was like.

33:18.316 --> 33:19.751
- It should work.

33:19.851 --> 33:24.431
You think it's working,
and then you realize it isn't.

33:26.296 --> 33:29.725
- Are you thinking about
your girlfriend?

33:29.825 --> 33:32.641
- About how to be fair to her.

33:32.741 --> 33:34.866
If I even know what fair is.

33:34.966 --> 33:37.091
- And what about you, Daniel?

33:37.191 --> 33:39.700
What about what you want?

33:41.757 --> 33:46.490
- I guess I want what
my parents have.

33:46.590 --> 33:48.984
It's magic,
the two of them.

33:49.084 --> 33:52.936
They fight,
they have their moments,

33:53.036 --> 33:54.355
but they make each other better.

33:57.563 --> 33:59.995
- If you really believe
that that's out there,

34:00.095 --> 34:03.946
then you shouldn't settle
for anything less.
Go find it.

34:04.046 --> 34:08.128
- It's easy for you to say
when you have an entire world
to choose from.

34:08.228 --> 34:10.737
Me, I don't even have
a passport.

34:10.837 --> 34:13.576
- So we'll get you one.

34:13.676 --> 34:16.415
I mean,
you still have a third wish.

34:29.060 --> 34:31.185
- Let's go inside, yeah?

34:31.284 --> 34:33.755
Get a drink,
go dance.

34:38.266 --> 34:40.123
- Hey, can you get me a drink?

35:12.756 --> 35:14.536
- You don't make it easy.

35:23.115 --> 35:25.662
- What, you're stalking me now?
- I'm not stalking you.

35:25.762 --> 35:28.424
You wouldn't answer
any of my calls.
- So you flew to Miami?

35:28.524 --> 35:31.033
- Look, I had to come
and see you to tell you
that none of this is true.

35:31.133 --> 35:32.452
All right?
None of it.

35:32.552 --> 35:34.984
My agent thought it would be
good publicity for the film.

35:35.084 --> 35:36.404
Supposedly it's tracking low
or something.

35:36.504 --> 35:37.938
- Oh, please.
The press hates you.

35:38.038 --> 35:39.550
That's why you're here.

35:39.650 --> 35:41.775
- Since when do I care
about the press?
Noa, come on.

35:41.875 --> 35:44.691
Noa, come on.
I just flew
halfway across the planet

35:44.791 --> 35:46.709
to come and tell you
that I love you.

35:50.852 --> 35:53.745
- Bravo.
Nice performance.

35:53.845 --> 35:55.624
- Noa, this is me.

35:57.451 --> 35:58.885
This is real.

36:03.742 --> 36:05.868
- Leave now and it's a win.

36:05.968 --> 36:08.361
- What?

36:08.461 --> 36:11.454
- When you do what I do
as long as I've done it,
you get a nose for people.

36:12.758 --> 36:15.190
I think you're a good guy,
Daniel.

36:15.290 --> 36:19.525
That's why it's my hope
that you leave now
before you get humiliated.

36:19.625 --> 36:21.543
- I get it, Gucci.
You don't like me.

36:22.196 --> 36:23.592
- Sometimes she finds them
at dinner.

36:23.692 --> 36:25.932
Sometimes at a party.

36:26.032 --> 36:29.462
One time she even found somebody
at a hot dog stand
near Rockefeller Center.

36:29.562 --> 36:32.876
Normal guys
who she takes a shine to.

36:32.976 --> 36:36.367
Next thing you know,
they're along for the ride.

36:36.467 --> 36:39.229
She does this after
every heartbreak.

36:41.148 --> 36:43.656
I think she likes to see
the world through your eyes.

36:43.756 --> 36:45.881
Feel your excitement.

36:45.981 --> 36:48.490
And then just when you start
to feel like you might
be friends,

36:48.590 --> 36:51.483
or fall in love,

36:51.583 --> 36:54.667
she has me quietly return you
to your reality.

36:57.069 --> 37:00.959
I don't think she realizes
how hard a landing that can be.

37:01.059 --> 37:04.258
You can stay and watch it happen
for the next few hours,

37:04.358 --> 37:07.596
or you can leave now
with your dignity.

37:12.491 --> 37:14.540
No, no, it's okay.
I'll give you my card. You can send it to me.

37:14.640 --> 37:17.916
- The last thing I want
is anything from any of you.

37:33.822 --> 37:35.179
- Whoo-hoo!

37:35.279 --> 37:36.829
- Put a shirt on!

38:48.593 --> 38:50.987
- Here you go.
- Beautiful.
Thank you.

38:53.581 --> 38:57.624
- Nat, what happened?
- Your girlfriend happened.

38:57.724 --> 39:00.486
Uh-uh.
BoHo Barbie, you were in the back.

39:03.018 --> 39:06.563
The hashtags.
She's changed our lives.

39:06.663 --> 39:09.555
Hi, sorry about that.
Thank you for waiting.

39:09.655 --> 39:11.896
- Oh, my God.
Oh.

39:11.996 --> 39:14.581
The hero returns.
Hey, did you sleep with her?

39:14.681 --> 39:16.599
- Hey!

39:17.290 --> 39:19.323
Okay, you don't call
your mother, huh?

39:26.114 --> 39:28.239
- Hang on.
Did you?

39:28.339 --> 39:31.998
- Yo. Yo!

39:37.469 --> 39:38.942
- Why does my phone
keep blowing up

39:39.042 --> 39:40.961
when I'm preparing to be
gracious to give Daniel a second chance?

39:44.720 --> 39:46.638
What?

39:58.340 --> 39:59.697
Hey!
- Excuse you!

40:02.636 --> 40:04.339
- Hey!

40:06.127 --> 40:08.751
- Where's Daniel?
- Hey, Vanessa.How was your sleep?

40:11.460 --> 40:13.854
- Where is Daniel?

40:17.752 --> 40:19.670
- Papa.
Papa.

40:20.361 --> 40:21.949
There's someone here to see you.
Get up.
