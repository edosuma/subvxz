00:00.133 --> 00:02.835
♪♪

00:24.491 --> 00:26.291
You're sure
you don't need help?

00:26.293 --> 00:28.694
I'm sure everything
will go horribly wrong.

00:28.696 --> 00:31.663
We'll be fine.
We got a Clone Wars
veteran with us.

00:31.665 --> 00:33.665
Ready, Captain?
Yes, sir.

00:33.667 --> 00:36.535
Uh, General. Kanan.

00:46.713 --> 00:48.847
There was a battle here
during the Clone War.

00:48.849 --> 00:50.849
This old transport's
the perfect place

00:50.851 --> 00:55.988
to find weapons, ammo,
maybe even some proton bombs.

00:55.990 --> 00:58.690
Hey, was this
a Separatist battle droid?

00:58.692 --> 01:01.860
Oh, yeah. Little piece
of one anyway.

01:01.862 --> 01:03.762
This place used to
be crawling with 'em.

01:03.764 --> 01:05.664
We called 'em clankers.

01:05.666 --> 01:08.367
Clankers. (CHUCKLES)
I like that.

01:08.369 --> 01:10.669
How many of these things
do you think you blasted?

01:10.671 --> 01:12.438
I don't know. Thousands.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.506
Probably tens of thousands.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.842
Never kept count
like some of the boys.

01:16.844 --> 01:18.744
They don't look
very dangerous.

01:18.746 --> 01:23.015
Listen, those droids
wiped out a lot of
Republic troopers.

01:23.017 --> 01:26.251
Many of them
were my friends.

01:27.620 --> 01:29.555
Rex has been
through a lot.

01:29.557 --> 01:32.357
Battles leave scars,
some you can't see.

01:39.799 --> 01:42.301
Hold up.
Let me recon first.

01:50.310 --> 01:53.445
Well, look at that.
We hit pay dirt.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.781
The munitions depot
is fully loaded.

01:55.783 --> 01:58.283
More proton bombs in there
than we can carry.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.786
Good job, Rex.
Way to go, Captain.

02:02.555 --> 02:04.857
VOICE: Roger, roger.
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)

02:06.893 --> 02:08.594
Hey, careful, kid.

02:08.596 --> 02:10.762
The droids used to
protect their armories
with ray shields.

02:10.764 --> 02:12.464
What's a ray shiel...

02:14.467 --> 02:16.735
This is a ray shield.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.737
Look! Aren't those
battle droids?

02:18.739 --> 02:20.005
I thought they were
all shut down.

02:20.007 --> 02:22.174
ZEB: Well, these weren't.

02:22.176 --> 02:26.578
You have been captured
by the Separatist Alliance.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.180
Huh?
Separatists?

02:32.185 --> 02:35.287
BATTLE DROID: Prepare to
blast the Republic invaders.

02:35.289 --> 02:37.456
Republic invaders?

02:37.458 --> 02:41.193
Belay that order.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
(CHATTERING OVER COMLINK)

02:41.195 --> 02:44.096
Roger, roger.
Wait, who's Roger?

02:44.098 --> 02:47.366
We have new orders,
incapacitate and capture.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.701
Activating stunner.
ALL: No!

02:49.703 --> 02:51.003
(ALL GRUNTING)

02:51.005 --> 02:53.238
Take them
to the command center.

02:54.774 --> 02:57.342
We haven't captured
anyone in years.

02:57.344 --> 02:59.444
We haven't captured
anyone ever.

02:59.446 --> 03:01.513
(GRUNTING)

03:03.783 --> 03:05.884
Ugh.

03:05.886 --> 03:09.021
Where... Where are we?

03:09.023 --> 03:13.492
DROID: How intriguing.
Well done, B1-268.

03:13.494 --> 03:14.927
BATTLE DROID: Roger, roger.

03:19.566 --> 03:22.801
Oh, no. The war,
it's not over!

03:22.803 --> 03:24.403
KANAN: Rex. Rex!

03:24.405 --> 03:25.637
Cody!

03:25.639 --> 03:26.672
Talk to me.

03:26.674 --> 03:27.839
Ah, Kanan.

03:27.841 --> 03:30.909
I'm sorry. I thought
you were someone else.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.344
I need you
here now, buddy.

03:32.346 --> 03:33.845
We're in the usual mess.

03:33.847 --> 03:36.481
I think the commander's
a super tactical droid.

03:40.520 --> 03:43.088
Ah, you're right.
He is.

03:43.090 --> 03:45.857
Is that bad?
It's really bad.

03:45.859 --> 03:48.093
That droid's
extremely intelligent.

03:48.095 --> 03:51.597
Near the end of the war,
Separatist droids

03:51.599 --> 03:54.433
significantly outnumbered
Republic units.

03:54.435 --> 03:57.669
By my calculations,
our probability
of being defeated

03:57.671 --> 04:00.505
was only 23.6%.

04:00.507 --> 04:05.711
After Clone Order 66,
the whole droid army
was given a shutdown command.

04:05.713 --> 04:07.846
How are you even operating?

04:07.848 --> 04:11.383
The Jedi betrayal
ended the war
for most of the galaxy.

04:11.385 --> 04:14.753
But here on Agamar,
I assumed it was
a Republic trick

04:14.755 --> 04:17.689
and prevented
the shutdown command.

04:17.691 --> 04:21.226
Well, it doesn't matter
how it ended.
The war is over.

04:21.228 --> 04:22.594
Let us go.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.363
Negative, Captain.

04:24.365 --> 04:27.432
I calculate
that this will be
my only opportunity

04:27.434 --> 04:30.736
to end the Clone Wars
as I planned,

04:30.738 --> 04:33.805
with a victory for
the Separatist Alliance.

04:33.807 --> 04:36.875
What do you want us
to do, surrender?

04:36.877 --> 04:40.912
On the contrary,
I want you to fight,

04:40.914 --> 04:45.584
to prove, once and for all,
whose tactical strategy
was superior.

04:45.586 --> 04:49.421
Well, you can count me out.
I'm not playing some
stupid war game.

04:49.423 --> 04:51.790
That is correct, Lasat.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.293
Your species were not
in the Clone Wars,

04:54.295 --> 04:57.996
so you will be the hostage
your allies must save.

04:57.998 --> 05:00.465
The "Jedi Rescue" is
a recurring scenario

05:00.467 --> 05:03.268
based on 132 battles
I have reviewed.

05:03.270 --> 05:05.504
Yeah, we've done it
a few times.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.939
Jedi, is this
your Padawan?

05:07.941 --> 05:10.108
Most of the time.
Good.

05:10.110 --> 05:13.645
A complete set
of Republic opponents
will make this authentic.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.114
No, it won't,
because we're not fighting.

05:16.116 --> 05:20.018
If you will not fight,
you will be terminated.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.687
I'll fight your Clone War.
What?

05:21.689 --> 05:22.988
Ezra, no!

05:22.990 --> 05:24.823
Hey, you both talk
about the Clone Wars.

05:24.825 --> 05:27.492
What it was like,
the good and the bad.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.828
I wanna help you win
this last battle.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.998
Besides, look at them.
How can we lose?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.633
Uh, hey.

05:34.635 --> 05:36.001
(SIGHS)

05:36.003 --> 05:37.369
Okay, it might be easier
to fight them head-on

05:37.371 --> 05:39.004
than to get out
of our current dilemma.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.807
(EXHALES) Fine.
Fine, we'll do it.

05:41.809 --> 05:44.042
Okay, but if we win,
Zeb goes free,

05:44.044 --> 05:46.945
and we take
all the proton bombs
in the hangar.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.947
I accept your terms.

05:52.285 --> 05:55.387
The commander has
initiated Battle Plan Zeta.

05:55.389 --> 05:57.322
Take your positions
at once.

05:57.324 --> 06:00.225
ALL: Roger, roger.

06:00.227 --> 06:02.894
BATTLE DROID:
Battle Plan Zeta? Finally!

06:08.334 --> 06:09.768
(GRUNTING)

06:22.081 --> 06:24.316
(BEEPING)

06:32.859 --> 06:34.926
How much fuel did we get
before the ambush?

06:34.928 --> 06:36.995
Enough for the whole fleet.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.931
I just hope Kanan and Rex
aren't expecting us back
on Agamar anytime soon.

06:47.173 --> 06:49.174
If Kanan needs help,
he'll call us.

06:49.176 --> 06:50.776
Since when?

06:50.778 --> 06:52.744
Fine. If Chopper's
in over his head,

06:52.746 --> 06:54.379
he'll hide and call us.

06:54.381 --> 06:56.081
SABINE:
That's more believable!

07:03.122 --> 07:04.756
Congratulations.

07:04.758 --> 07:08.927
Your plan to ambush them
at the fuel depot
worked like a charm.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.762
Only if we catch them.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.264
Excuse me, Governor.

07:12.266 --> 07:15.200
We've intercepted
a rebel transmission
from the Agamar system

07:15.202 --> 07:17.402
before it was received
by the rebel ship.

07:17.404 --> 07:21.640
The message is encrypted,
but it repeats like
a distress signal.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.108
Interesting.

07:23.110 --> 07:26.278
The rebels there must
be desperate for help

07:26.280 --> 07:27.946
that will never come.

07:27.948 --> 07:31.450
Locate the nearest
Imperial outpost to Agamar
and deploy them.

07:31.452 --> 07:32.517
Immediately.

07:32.519 --> 07:35.987
TACTICAL DROID: (ON PA)
<i>The objective of this battle</i>
<i>is simple.</i>

07:35.989 --> 07:38.990
<i>You must fight your way</i>
<i>back to my command center</i>

07:38.992 --> 07:41.626
<i>and capture it</i>
<i>to free your friend.</i>

07:41.628 --> 07:44.763
Rex, you've got more
battlefield experience
than either of us.

07:44.765 --> 07:45.964
You lead.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.934
All right. Our first goal
is to get inside the hangar.

07:48.936 --> 07:51.102
Kalani is a war machine,
programmed to kill,

07:51.104 --> 07:53.638
and he's got the numbers
and the firepower to do it.

07:53.640 --> 07:57.142
Our only chance
is to be aggressive,
surprise him,

07:57.144 --> 07:59.144
hopefully put him
on the defensive.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.979
How many droids
do you think he has?

08:00.981 --> 08:04.349
KALANI: <i> The last battle</i>
<i>will begin now.</i>

08:08.754 --> 08:11.289
A lot.
He has a lot of droids!

08:11.291 --> 08:13.992
We've gotta scatter them.
Use the sword and shield
maneuver.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.494
Wait. What does that mean?

08:15.496 --> 08:17.095
We block, he fires.

08:21.968 --> 08:23.668
Everybody ready?
Yep!

08:23.670 --> 08:24.936
Let's go!

08:29.008 --> 08:30.942
Ezra, get ready to duck!

08:31.611 --> 08:33.011
Okay!

08:34.046 --> 08:35.247
Now!

08:40.520 --> 08:41.920
Again!

08:47.627 --> 08:50.228
That scattered 'em!
Everybody forward!

08:55.301 --> 08:57.002
Ezra, form it up!

08:57.004 --> 08:58.236
(GRUNTS)

08:58.238 --> 08:59.471
We've gotta stay together.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.578
The hangar looks clear.
Let's go.

09:06.580 --> 09:10.715
Wait. That's not how
it normally goes.
What's wrong?

09:10.717 --> 09:14.185
The droids usually
keep coming,
wave after wave.

09:14.187 --> 09:17.255
That tactical droid
has had a long time
to think about this.

09:17.257 --> 09:20.025
And remember,
he wants to win.

09:20.027 --> 09:22.093
I'm surprised
it means so much to him.

09:22.095 --> 09:24.262
Yeah, it means a lot
to his programming.

09:24.264 --> 09:26.231
It means a lot
to mine as well.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.532
Your programming?

09:27.534 --> 09:29.868
We clones were bred
for combat.

09:29.870 --> 09:33.505
With few exceptions,
there was no other way
of life for us.

09:33.507 --> 09:35.040
We should move.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.142
Right, Commander.
Uh, Kanan.

09:42.181 --> 09:44.849
Looks like my friends
are doing pretty good.

09:44.851 --> 09:46.585
You might as well
surrender now.

09:46.587 --> 09:50.121
I am not programmed
to comprehend your humor.

09:50.123 --> 09:51.957
I'm not joking.

09:51.959 --> 09:55.226
Ha, ha, ha.

09:55.228 --> 09:58.296
Your Republic friends
have taken the bait.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.765
Send in the destroyers.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.341
Incoming!

10:11.978 --> 10:13.878
KANAN: Ezra, get back!
They're too dangerous.

10:23.723 --> 10:26.124
Can't advance with
those destroyers up there.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.826
There's no way
to breach their shields.

10:29.128 --> 10:31.062
Look! That crane!

10:31.064 --> 10:33.898
I bet we can use it
to take out the catwalk.

10:33.900 --> 10:36.234
I'll make a run for it.
We'll draw their attention.

10:36.236 --> 10:37.469
There's gonna be
a lot of fire.

10:37.471 --> 10:38.637
We'll have to be quick.

10:38.639 --> 10:41.172
Ezra, move as fast
as you can.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.574
You can count on me.

10:58.190 --> 11:02.360
Ah, the Jedi have split up,
as they do 76% of the time.

11:02.362 --> 11:04.429
Squad six, advance.

11:04.431 --> 11:06.331
Move in!

11:07.366 --> 11:09.567
REX: More droids!
We've gotta take cover.

11:12.004 --> 11:13.438
Hey!

11:16.308 --> 11:18.643
(GASPS)
(GRUNTS)

11:18.645 --> 11:20.545
Hmm, Chop,
where've you been?

11:20.547 --> 11:23.815
(GRUNTING)
How'd you send
a distress signal?

11:23.817 --> 11:25.884
(GRUNTING)

11:25.886 --> 11:28.019
Mmm! I'm kinda
in the middle of something.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.355
(INSISTENT GRUNTING)
Okay, okay!

11:34.126 --> 11:36.394
A shuttle!
It's a good find, Chop.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.396
But we're not leaving
without Zeb.

11:38.398 --> 11:41.599
So you get it running
and I'll get the others.
(GRUNTING)

11:43.335 --> 11:45.470
Where is that kid?

11:45.472 --> 11:47.238
We're gonna get
trapped here.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.040
We need to move. Now.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.875
No, Rex. Wait!

12:17.903 --> 12:20.405
You all right?
(CHUCKLES)

12:20.407 --> 12:23.842
I'm good.
Generation one armor
always holds up.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.445
No ray shields
this time.

12:27.447 --> 12:30.715
Well, that went
just as planned,
more or less.

12:30.717 --> 12:32.250
I make a pretty good
soldier, huh?

12:32.252 --> 12:35.186
No. A good soldier
follows orders.

12:35.188 --> 12:38.556
That plan was based
on timing and execution.

12:38.558 --> 12:40.391
And you took too long!

12:40.393 --> 12:41.526
But Chopper
wanted to show me...

12:41.528 --> 12:44.262
This is not a game!
This is life and death!

12:44.264 --> 12:46.698
Every move you make
affects the rest of us.

12:46.700 --> 12:49.033
If we're gonna survive this,
we're gonna do it

12:49.035 --> 12:51.302
with strategy and discipline.

12:53.405 --> 12:54.739
It's not you.

12:54.741 --> 12:57.509
He needs to finish
this battle his way.

12:59.145 --> 13:00.745
Just like that droid.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.556
Rex, get between us!

13:11.558 --> 13:13.291
REX: Ezra, incoming!

13:18.998 --> 13:20.732
Push and fire, now!

13:29.408 --> 13:30.675
(GROANS)

13:40.686 --> 13:42.020
It worked!

13:46.425 --> 13:49.327
Shield overheated.
That droid's too old.

13:50.596 --> 13:52.831
Huh. Just like me.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.532
You okay?

13:54.534 --> 13:56.501
Yeah, I'll be fine.

13:58.337 --> 14:00.038
(DOOR OPENS)

14:04.710 --> 14:07.345
Well, looks like we win.

14:08.214 --> 14:10.748
I disagree, Captain.

14:12.484 --> 14:15.353
Rex, no! Don't!

14:15.355 --> 14:18.656
We didn't win.
These droids are so old,
they malfunctioned.

14:18.658 --> 14:21.459
If they hadn't,
we'd be goners.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.394
The boy is correct.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.563
The droid army
would have prevailed.

14:25.565 --> 14:28.666
So, technically,
victory is ours.

14:28.668 --> 14:31.469
No, it's not! I never
really thought about it.

14:31.471 --> 14:32.570
I never asked.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.405
I know the Jedi
were wiped out,

14:34.407 --> 14:36.708
the clones were
decommissioned,

14:36.710 --> 14:39.344
and the droid army
was just shut down.

14:39.346 --> 14:42.247
The Clone War ended,
but why?

14:42.249 --> 14:44.482
If none of you won,
who did?

14:49.488 --> 14:51.589
ZEB: Uh, the Empire.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.491
Zeb, that's right!

14:53.493 --> 14:55.059
How did you know?

14:55.061 --> 14:57.061
Because they're here,

14:57.063 --> 14:58.830
and they're about
to win again.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.770
I've got a new
calculation for you.

15:05.772 --> 15:09.007
What are the chances
your droid army
can defeat the Empire?

15:09.009 --> 15:10.875
My resources are depleted.

15:10.877 --> 15:13.845
However, the droid army
is not currently at war

15:13.847 --> 15:15.446
with the Galactic Empire.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.181
You wanna bet?

15:17.183 --> 15:20.618
Unit B1-268,
analyze the threat.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.186
Roger, roger.

15:22.188 --> 15:23.588
Move in.

15:31.563 --> 15:33.331
(WEAPONS COCKING)

15:34.533 --> 15:36.067
Is that what I think it is?

15:36.069 --> 15:38.937
Greetings.
I am unit B1-268.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.705
My commander has sent me

15:40.707 --> 15:42.373
to report your intentions.
Yeah. Clone Wars
battle droid.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.575
Surprised its battery
hasn't run out.
Um, are we...

15:44.577 --> 15:46.477
Don't see many
of these anymore.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.980
Oh, no. And when you do,
there's usually
a bunch of them.

15:48.982 --> 15:51.316
All right,
you know the drill.

15:51.318 --> 15:52.817
Greetings.

15:52.819 --> 15:55.320
(SCREAMING)

15:55.322 --> 15:56.554
Oh, my...

15:59.625 --> 16:01.826
I think we face
a common enemy now.

16:01.828 --> 16:03.628
Ah, wait a minute!

16:03.630 --> 16:05.496
Let him finish, Captain.

16:05.498 --> 16:08.666
Clones? Battle droids?
You destroyed each other.

16:08.668 --> 16:12.303
And when you were
both weak enough,
the Empire took over.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.742
General, what were
the Separatists fighting for?

16:17.744 --> 16:19.978
According to
my programming,

16:19.980 --> 16:22.513
freedom from the tyranny
of the Republic.

16:22.515 --> 16:23.982
Hmm, fighting tyranny.

16:23.984 --> 16:26.517
Sounds like the Empire
has always been your enemy.

16:26.519 --> 16:30.521
You are against the Empire.
I am against the Republic.

16:30.523 --> 16:33.725
Now the Republic
has become the Empire.

16:34.693 --> 16:36.361
I accept your logic.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.529
We are on the same side.
Sorry.

16:39.498 --> 16:40.999
I guess we are.

16:41.001 --> 16:44.335
However, as I stated,
my forces are
too depleted

16:44.337 --> 16:47.705
for me to plan
a successful
counterattack.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.207
Fighting
insurmountable odds?

16:49.209 --> 16:50.675
We can help you with that.

16:55.147 --> 16:57.515
(AGITATED GRUNTING)

16:57.517 --> 17:00.018
Yes, Chopper, we know
the Empire is here.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.386
How's the shuttle coming?

17:01.388 --> 17:03.121
Shuttle?
What shuttle?

17:03.123 --> 17:05.723
The one I tried
to tell you about earlier.

17:05.725 --> 17:10.628
We have three
Sheathipede-class shuttles,
but they have no weapons.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.830
No, but they can
get us outta here.

17:12.832 --> 17:15.566
A successful retreat
is improbable.

17:15.568 --> 17:19.537
The walkers will destroy
the ships before they
escape the hangar.

17:19.539 --> 17:22.006
We don't have
the firepower to
take on walkers.

17:22.008 --> 17:23.808
What about the bombs
we came here for?

17:23.810 --> 17:26.344
We have no cannon
to fire the shells.

17:26.346 --> 17:29.680
Otherwise, I would have
used them on you.
Oh, thanks.

17:29.682 --> 17:32.417
We're running out of time!
REX: Ah, we roll 'em!

17:32.419 --> 17:34.652
The proton bombs.
We roll 'em across
the hangar

17:34.654 --> 17:36.587
and into the feet
of the walkers.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.022
Then we blast 'em!

17:38.024 --> 17:40.658
My battle droids
are not accurate.

17:40.660 --> 17:43.694
However, you are,
Master Jedi.

17:43.696 --> 17:45.596
I don't understand.

17:45.598 --> 17:49.600
My droids will
line up and fire at you
and your apprentice.

17:49.602 --> 17:52.336
You two will then
redirect their
blaster bolts

17:52.338 --> 17:54.572
toward the shells
more accurately,

17:54.574 --> 17:56.741
thus setting off
more targets

17:56.743 --> 17:58.576
than my droids
could hit alone.

17:58.578 --> 18:02.213
Well, this takes trust
to a whole new level.

18:02.215 --> 18:03.948
(SIGHS)

18:03.950 --> 18:06.651
Chopper, get the munitions
ready to roll.

18:10.689 --> 18:12.123
REX: Ready, Zeb?

18:13.592 --> 18:15.526
(SIGHS)
One last glorious day

18:15.528 --> 18:18.729
in the Grand Army
of the Republic.

18:18.731 --> 18:20.865
Chopper, have the shuttle
ready to go!

18:20.867 --> 18:22.667
KANAN: D squad, get ready!

18:24.703 --> 18:28.573
I have never attempted
such a desperate strategy.

18:28.575 --> 18:30.975
That's why we always won.

18:30.977 --> 18:32.443
Not always.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.445
Hey, guys,
focus on the present.

18:34.447 --> 18:37.048
Once those shells explode,
get to your shuttles.

18:37.050 --> 18:38.349
BOTH: Roger, roger.

18:43.288 --> 18:44.689
(BEEPING)

18:59.004 --> 19:00.338
Now!

19:05.144 --> 19:06.410
Fire.

19:14.286 --> 19:17.321
This might be
our only chance.
Get to the ships!

19:25.931 --> 19:27.999
I made it!
I made it!

19:28.001 --> 19:29.333
Aaah!

19:32.638 --> 19:34.138
Lead shuttle,
bank right!

19:34.140 --> 19:35.540
Bank right!

19:52.057 --> 19:54.458
We made it!
General, do you read us?

19:54.460 --> 19:56.861
<i>Affirmative. We have</i>
<i>survived the battle.</i>

19:56.863 --> 20:00.965
<i>It was not a victory,</i>
<i>but a successful strategy</i>
<i>nonetheless.</i>

20:00.967 --> 20:03.301
No, it was a victory.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.971
We all just won
the Clone War,

20:06.973 --> 20:09.640
and you ended it, Ezra.

20:09.642 --> 20:12.210
A galaxy of senators
couldn't do that.

20:12.212 --> 20:16.180
An army of Jedi, clones
and droids couldn't find
the middle ground,

20:16.182 --> 20:18.883
but you did.

20:18.885 --> 20:22.920
Rex, all I did
was point out that none
of you were meant to win.

20:22.922 --> 20:25.289
You couldn't.
And we needed to hear it.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.191
KALANI: <i> Agreed.</i>

20:27.193 --> 20:30.528
<i>I am satisfied</i>
<i>if you are, Captain.</i>

20:30.530 --> 20:32.029
I am.

20:32.031 --> 20:33.164
<i>Very good.</i>

20:33.166 --> 20:34.899
<i>Now, based upon this battle,</i>

20:34.901 --> 20:37.835
<i>I calculate that</i>
<i>you have less than</i>
<i>a one percent chance</i>

20:37.837 --> 20:41.372
<i>of staging a successful</i>
<i>rebellion against</i>
<i>the Empire,</i>

20:41.374 --> 20:45.209
<i>so this is where</i>
<i>we must part ways.</i>

20:45.211 --> 20:47.044
Roger, roger.

20:47.046 --> 20:50.248
I can't imagine
fighting that many
droids all the time.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.783
(CHUCKLES) Well, if you
think that was bad,

20:52.785 --> 20:55.152
let me tell you about
the Battle of Geonosis.

21:02.628 --> 21:05.963
HERA: (ON COMLINK)
<i>This is</i> Ghost <i> to away team.</i>
<i>Spectre-1, are you there?</i>

21:05.965 --> 21:08.199
Hera, I was just
about to call you.

21:08.201 --> 21:09.934
How was your day?

21:09.936 --> 21:12.103
<i>We're tracking two shuttles</i>
<i>leaving the system.</i>

21:12.105 --> 21:15.906
<i>Is everything all right?</i>
<i>Did you have trouble</i>
<i>securing the bombs?</i>

21:15.908 --> 21:18.876
<i>Well, the bad news is,</i>
<i>we didn't get the bombs.</i>

21:18.878 --> 21:20.978
<i>The good news is,</i>
<i>we don't need a pickup</i>

21:20.980 --> 21:22.913
<i>because we found</i>
<i>a new</i> Phantom.

21:22.915 --> 21:24.815
<i>Tell Sabine she's gonna</i>
<i>need a paint job.</i>
