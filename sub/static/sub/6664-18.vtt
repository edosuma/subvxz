00:00.066 --> 00:01.467
Adult adam: <i> Back in the '80s,</i>
<i> before you could</i>

00:01.469 --> 00:02.835
<i> Buy music</i>
<i> with the click of a button,</i>

00:02.837 --> 00:05.804
<i> You'd go to an actual</i>
<i> record store to purchase</i>
<i> your favorite cassette tapes.</i>

00:05.806 --> 00:08.507
<i> We thought we'd reached</i>
<i> the height</i>
<i> of musical technology,</i>

00:08.509 --> 00:10.142
<i> Until this happened.</i>

00:10.144 --> 00:11.910
Whoa!
Whoa!

00:11.912 --> 00:14.279
Adult adam: <i> Behold, the cd,</i>

00:14.381 --> 00:15.714
<i> A disc surrounded by a case</i>

00:15.716 --> 00:18.951
<i> Within another,</i>
<i> larger rectangular case.</i>

00:18.953 --> 00:20.786
It's a compact disc.

00:20.788 --> 00:22.121
Oh, it's so beautiful.

00:22.123 --> 00:23.522
I can't wait to go home
and throw away

00:23.524 --> 00:26.191
My hundreds
of useless cassettes.

00:27.961 --> 00:30.863
We need to have this
right now!

00:30.865 --> 00:32.164
You! Sam goody!

00:32.166 --> 00:35.034
That's the name of the store.
My name's jared.

00:35.036 --> 00:36.535
How much for a cd player?

00:36.537 --> 00:38.237
$900, plus tax.

00:38.239 --> 00:38.937
We will never own one.

00:38.939 --> 00:41.206
We will when I convince
dad to buy us one.

00:41.208 --> 00:42.441
And how do you plan
on doing that?

00:42.443 --> 00:47.079
A little something
I like to call
"barry goldberg charm."

00:48.248 --> 00:49.415
Buy us a cd player!

00:49.417 --> 00:50.449
I don't know what that is,

00:50.451 --> 00:53.285
But I'm sure
it's unnecessary
and expensive.

00:53.287 --> 00:54.053
It's the opposite of that.

00:54.055 --> 00:58.624
Engineers in lab coats have
created a musical experience

00:58.626 --> 01:00.726
That is so crisp
and clean,

01:00.728 --> 01:03.128
It can literally
improve your hearing.

01:03.130 --> 01:03.796
No more music crap.

01:03.798 --> 01:07.933
First, I bought you records,
then eight-tracks,
then cassettes.

01:07.935 --> 01:10.469
Where does it end?
Barry: Here!

01:10.471 --> 01:12.404
The technology ends here.

01:12.406 --> 01:16.608
Cds are so good
that scientists have
given up and quit.

01:16.610 --> 01:19.244
It's all over the paper.
They're unemployed.

01:19.246 --> 01:22.014
Let me take
a swing at it, pal.

01:22.016 --> 01:23.615
Dad, this is crazy important.

01:23.617 --> 01:27.553
Music means everything to me.
It's, like, my thing.

01:27.555 --> 01:28.153
It's my thing, too.

01:28.155 --> 01:31.890
Big tasty needs
a cd player to keep up
with the changing times.

01:31.892 --> 01:33.659
See, that's the problem
with you kids,

01:33.661 --> 01:34.827
Everything is your thing!

01:34.829 --> 01:37.429
Last month,
I had to buy you tap shoes

01:37.431 --> 01:38.363
'cause dance
was your thing.

01:38.365 --> 01:43.302
And before that,
fashion and skiing
and horseback riding...

01:43.304 --> 01:44.069
Why do <i> I</i> get punished

01:44.071 --> 01:46.238
'cause she can't find
something she's good at?

01:46.240 --> 01:47.739
Oh, don't get me started
with you,

01:47.741 --> 01:51.844
With your hockey and karate
and break-dancing.

01:51.846 --> 01:52.711
Dad, this is different.

01:52.713 --> 01:55.581
And so are
the last hundred things.
It's not happening.

01:55.583 --> 01:56.615
Oh, it'll happen
when I go upstairs

01:56.617 --> 01:59.952
And write the greatest song
in the history of the world.

01:59.954 --> 02:01.153
With a vicious
rap interlude.

02:01.155 --> 02:02.621
And when you hear
my angelic song,

02:02.623 --> 02:06.258
You will weep and clap
and be so moved

02:06.260 --> 02:09.761
That you will demand
that we have a cd player.

02:09.929 --> 02:12.397
I'm not
an unreasonable man.

02:12.399 --> 02:12.998
If you two write

02:13.000 --> 02:15.234
The greatest song
in the history of the world,

02:15.236 --> 02:18.737
I will indeed buy you
a cd player.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.672
Great! Then I will

02:20.674 --> 02:22.674
Go write the greatest song
in the world.

02:22.676 --> 02:24.943
With a vicious
rap interlude.

02:24.945 --> 02:27.146
Good luck to you.

02:28.748 --> 02:29.715
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:29.717 --> 02:34.119
<i> ¶ but nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

02:36.055 --> 02:37.089
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

02:37.091 --> 02:40.492
<i> ¶ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

02:40.494 --> 02:44.596
Adult adam: <i> It was April 2,</i>
<i> 1980-something, my birthday.</i>

02:44.598 --> 02:45.531
<i> And that meant one thing,</i>

02:45.533 --> 02:49.568
<i> Desperately avoiding</i>
<i> an onslaught of love</i>
<i> from my mom.</i>

02:49.570 --> 02:51.770
Birthday boy sighting!
Oh!

02:51.772 --> 02:52.437
(laughs)

02:52.439 --> 02:55.007
It's my little
love muffin's birthday.

02:55.009 --> 02:55.574
And how do I know?

02:55.576 --> 02:58.010
Because I grew
your body in my body.

02:58.012 --> 02:59.411
Will you stop
bringing that up?

02:59.413 --> 03:01.046
We all know
where I came from.

03:01.048 --> 03:04.049
We are gonna go all out
and party hearty.

03:04.051 --> 03:04.783
Yeah, about that...

03:04.785 --> 03:07.986
I was thinking this year,
I just hit the arcade
with chad.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.655
Oh, poop.
It's your big day.

03:09.657 --> 03:11.690
We've got to do
something special.

03:11.692 --> 03:12.658
Mom, I know
I've said this

03:12.660 --> 03:14.459
Every day
for the past two weeks,

03:14.461 --> 03:15.761
But I'm in
middle school now,

03:15.763 --> 03:18.597
And birthday parties
are not cool.

03:18.599 --> 03:19.398
Fine, moody judy.

03:19.400 --> 03:22.668
You can celebrate
with no family
and no fanfare.

03:22.670 --> 03:26.438
But before you go,
can I at least
give you my present?

03:26.440 --> 03:27.639
It's down
in the basement.

03:27.641 --> 03:30.008
I think you're really
gonna love it.

03:32.378 --> 03:32.945
All: Surprise!

03:32.947 --> 03:35.214
Adult adam: <i> And there it was,</i>
<i> my mom went behind my back</i>

03:35.216 --> 03:39.017
<i> And invited my friends over</i>
<i> for a stupid little-kid party!</i>

03:39.019 --> 03:40.219
(whispering)
what have you done?

03:40.221 --> 03:42.187
All my friends are gonna think
this is super-lame.

03:42.189 --> 03:46.425
Yo, mrs. G,
digging this "o" dip.
Mmm.

03:46.526 --> 03:48.126
And why did you invite
garry ball?

03:48.128 --> 03:50.095
He's super-cool
and gets away with murder

03:50.097 --> 03:51.830
'cause his dad's
the principal!

03:51.832 --> 03:53.432
Oh, nonsense.

03:53.434 --> 03:54.967
Okay, kiddos,

03:54.969 --> 03:56.668
I've scored everything
you're gonna need

03:56.670 --> 03:58.770
To have a raging
slumber party.

03:58.772 --> 04:02.341
Jolt cola, pixy stix,
<i> mad libs,</i> ouija board,

04:02.343 --> 04:06.445
And a pen to draw
on the first dorkus
who falls asleep.

04:06.447 --> 04:08.280
I'm looking at you,
dave sirota.

04:08.282 --> 04:09.748
(beverly laughs)

04:09.750 --> 04:10.349
Burn!

04:10.351 --> 04:12.951
I am a funny mom.
Jam on.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.286
Adult adam: <i> My friends</i>
<i> were gonna give me hell.</i>

04:14.288 --> 04:16.321
<i> This was the epitome</i>
<i> of uncool!</i>

04:16.323 --> 04:17.956
Dude, this is gonna be
so rad.

04:17.958 --> 04:22.494
Really? You guys are
actually stoked about
a slumber party?

04:22.496 --> 04:25.597
Slumber party?
I thought this was
a sleepover.

04:25.599 --> 04:26.298
What's the difference?

04:26.300 --> 04:29.234
Ha! Stupid chad kremp
doesn't know the difference.

04:29.236 --> 04:31.136
Someone should tell him
in great detail

04:31.138 --> 04:32.404
So he knows
what to expect tonight.

04:32.406 --> 04:35.841
Slumber parties
are for little kids
with sleeping bags.

04:35.843 --> 04:38.744
But at a sleepover,
we break all the rules.

04:38.746 --> 04:40.579
Um, chad is wondering
if you could give

04:40.581 --> 04:42.281
Some specific rules
we're gonna break.

04:42.283 --> 04:44.082
Garry: (scoffs)
whatever we want, man.

04:44.084 --> 04:46.652
We can dip some 'chaw,
make some prank calls,

04:46.654 --> 04:49.821
Light off some fireworks,
sneak out, make out.

04:49.823 --> 04:50.589
Is your sister home?

04:50.591 --> 04:53.659
Chad's now wondering
if part of the sleepover

04:53.661 --> 04:54.793
Is making your host
feel uncomfortable.

04:54.795 --> 04:58.463
Adult adam: <i> Nothing could</i>
<i> prepare me for what</i>
<i> my friends had in store.</i>

04:58.465 --> 05:00.866
<i> Dave kim brought</i>
<i> his great-grandfather's pipe.</i>

05:00.868 --> 05:04.169
<i> Sirota topped that with</i>
<i> his brother's throwing stars.</i>

05:04.171 --> 05:05.637
<i> But both paled</i>
<i> in comparison</i>

05:05.639 --> 05:08.173
<i> To what garry ball</i>
<i> offered up.</i>

05:08.308 --> 05:12.210
<i> A real, grown-up,</i>
<i> ice-cold beer!</i>

05:12.212 --> 05:13.945
<i> Served warm.</i>

05:13.947 --> 05:14.646
All: Whoa.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.281
Adult adam: <i> While I was</i>
<i> trying to keep my cool,</i>

05:16.283 --> 05:17.883
<i> Barry and erica</i>
<i> were trying to write</i>

05:17.885 --> 05:19.651
<i> The greatest song</i>
<i> known to man.</i>

05:19.653 --> 05:23.188
Okay, here we go,
greatest song of all time.

05:23.190 --> 05:25.057
Let's do this.

05:25.191 --> 05:26.792
(keyboard playing)
<i> ¶ music</i>

05:26.794 --> 05:31.263
<i> ¶ singin' music</i>
<i> with my mouth ¶</i>

05:31.265 --> 05:32.564
That's it! We did it!

05:32.566 --> 05:35.033
Yeah, I think
we should keep working.

05:35.035 --> 05:36.301
Let's break this down.

05:36.303 --> 05:37.836
What are the greatest
songs about?

05:37.838 --> 05:40.172
Well, obviously you got
to start with
a guy in a mill.

05:40.174 --> 05:41.106
No.
And he's working

05:41.108 --> 05:44.876
His fingers to the bone
on some type of metal thing
where sparks fly.

05:44.878 --> 05:48.347
And he's dead-broke,
definitely lives in jersey.

05:48.349 --> 05:49.014
Why jersey?

05:49.016 --> 05:51.316
That's the heartland,
where all
the real people live

05:51.318 --> 05:53.618
And die,
'cause millwork is dangerous.

05:53.620 --> 05:56.154
Forget the mills.
We need to think bigger.

05:56.156 --> 05:58.890
The greatest songs
are always about love,

05:58.892 --> 06:00.392
About loss and yearning,

06:00.394 --> 06:03.829
About driving all night
and islands in the stream

06:03.831 --> 06:05.630
And seconding that emotion.

06:05.632 --> 06:07.599
Love is a battlefield.

06:07.601 --> 06:08.967
Exactly!

06:08.969 --> 06:09.568
It's a battlefield,

06:09.570 --> 06:13.105
And you got to crush
your enemies like a ninja,

06:13.107 --> 06:14.840
A ninja of love!

06:15.441 --> 06:16.241
Both: Love ninja!

06:16.243 --> 06:19.211
That's it! We did it!
We changed the world!

06:19.213 --> 06:21.046
<i> ¶ she's a love ninja</i>

06:21.048 --> 06:23.215
<i> ¶ love ninja ¶</i>
yes, yes.

06:23.217 --> 06:23.849
Now sing something

06:23.851 --> 06:25.817
About how she snaps necks
and takes no prisoners.

06:25.819 --> 06:29.087
It's a love song.
She can't be snapping necks.

06:29.089 --> 06:32.057
But she can be
breaking hearts.

06:32.059 --> 06:34.960
Or breaking
the neck of the heart.

06:34.962 --> 06:38.230
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
That's so good!

06:38.364 --> 06:41.867
Adult adam: <i> An hour later,</i>
<i> their musical opus was ready.</i>

06:41.869 --> 06:42.734
Okay, pops,
I need to make sure

06:42.736 --> 06:45.971
That this is the greatest
song of all time
before dad hears it.

06:45.973 --> 06:48.440
Just give me
your honest opinion.

06:48.875 --> 06:51.777
(keyboard plays)
<i> ¶ well, it was</i>
<i> just outside of jersey</i>

06:51.779 --> 06:54.246
<i> ¶ but not in</i>
<i> the actual state</i>

06:54.248 --> 06:56.982
<i> ¶ donny drilled</i>
<i> metal things in a mill</i>

06:56.984 --> 06:58.617
<i> ¶ danger was his fate</i>

06:58.619 --> 07:00.886
<i> ¶ but his desire</i>
<i> burned like fire</i>

07:00.888 --> 07:03.422
<i> ¶ for a stealthy gal</i>
<i> named kate</i>

07:03.424 --> 07:06.625
<i> ¶ she's a love ninja</i>

07:06.627 --> 07:08.427
<i> ¶ a love ninja</i>

07:08.429 --> 07:12.264
<i> ¶ love ninja,</i>
<i> snapped the neck of my heart</i>

07:12.266 --> 07:14.933
<i> ¶ she's a love ninja</i>

07:14.935 --> 07:16.134
<i> ¶ nunchucked my life apart</i>

07:16.136 --> 07:17.836
(rapping)
<i> ¶ roundhouse, crane kick,</i>
<i> elbow chop</i>

07:17.838 --> 07:20.539
<i> ¶ ninja stole my heart,</i>
<i> and she wouldn't stop</i>

07:20.541 --> 07:22.774
<i> ¶ bo staff, blow dart,</i>
<i> samurai blade</i>

07:22.776 --> 07:24.376
<i> ¶ ninja went off</i>
<i> like a ninja grenade</i>

07:24.378 --> 07:26.845
<i> ¶ girl, you threw</i>
<i> a smoke bomb,</i>
<i> vanished with a spark</i>

07:26.847 --> 07:28.947
<i> ¶ she's more deadly</i>
<i> than a robot shark</i>

07:28.949 --> 07:31.082
<i> ¶ a robot shark,</i>
<i> how sweet would that be?</i>

07:31.084 --> 07:34.119
<i> ¶ mechanical beast</i>
<i> swimming out to sea</i>

07:34.121 --> 07:38.056
<i> ¶ love ninja,</i>
<i> a love ninja ¶</i>

07:38.058 --> 07:39.825
(music stops)
blah, blah, blah.
(chuckles)

07:39.827 --> 07:42.227
Yeah, it's just a taste,
but what do you think?

07:42.229 --> 07:45.030
You two are my grandkids,
and I love you,

07:45.032 --> 07:48.800
So if you want me to say
this confusing fakakta song

07:48.802 --> 07:52.904
About ninjas and robot sharks
is actually good,

07:52.906 --> 07:54.339
I'll say it.

07:54.341 --> 07:55.040
Great! Do that!

07:55.042 --> 07:58.210
I'm sorry. I thought I could,
but I can't.

07:58.212 --> 07:58.677
Damn it!

07:58.679 --> 08:00.378
How else are we
supposed to convince dad

08:00.380 --> 08:01.413
That music is our thing?

08:01.415 --> 08:03.682
Can't be done.
You're dealing with a man

08:03.684 --> 08:06.918
Who has no interest
in music whatsoever.

08:06.920 --> 08:07.919
Everyone likes music.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.754
Oh, my god.
I think pops is right.

08:09.756 --> 08:11.356
How can he actually
not like music?

08:11.358 --> 08:15.427
Some dads just don't.
It's more common
than you think.

08:15.429 --> 08:17.496
Well, that's perfect.

08:17.498 --> 08:18.563
Dad's a blank slate.

08:18.565 --> 08:20.599
We don't have to write
the world's greatest song.

08:20.601 --> 08:24.336
We can just sing
someone else's
and say that it's ours.

08:24.338 --> 08:25.370
That's genius!

08:25.372 --> 08:26.171
That's not genius.

08:26.173 --> 08:29.975
Genius is coming up
with an idea that makes sense.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.276
Your idea's terrible.

08:31.278 --> 08:34.779
Barry, come on.
We got to go steal a song.

08:36.682 --> 08:37.516
(sniffs)

08:37.518 --> 08:39.518
The beer smells
kind of funky.

08:39.520 --> 08:40.252
That's the point, dude.

08:40.254 --> 08:43.421
This is craft brew,
fancy kind, trust me.

08:43.423 --> 08:45.257
Shouldn't it say, like,
"schlitz" or something?

08:45.259 --> 08:46.558
Nah, it's better
than real beer.

08:46.560 --> 08:49.661
My dad brews it
in the downstairs bathtub.

08:49.663 --> 08:50.862
Dave kim, you're up.

08:50.864 --> 08:51.630
Adult adam: <i> This was it.</i>

08:51.632 --> 08:53.832
<i> Sure, we were nervous,</i>
<i> but it was my birthday,</i>

08:53.834 --> 08:57.035
<i> And we would</i>
<i> become men together.</i>

08:57.136 --> 08:57.869
(gags)

08:57.871 --> 08:59.137
<i> Well, everyone but me.</i>

08:59.139 --> 09:00.438
<i> Sirota immediately booted.</i>

09:00.440 --> 09:03.108
<i> Cool guy garry ball</i>
<i> wasn't far behind.</i>

09:03.110 --> 09:03.775
<i> Chad was next.</i>

09:03.777 --> 09:06.444
<i> And finally, dave kim,</i>
<i> who had no options left.</i>

09:06.446 --> 09:10.048
<i> That first sip came up</i>
<i> as quickly as it went down.</i>

09:10.050 --> 09:11.683
Not the washing machine!

09:11.685 --> 09:12.284
Stop judging me!

09:12.286 --> 09:14.252
Adult adam: <i> There was no way</i>
<i> it could get worse.</i>

09:14.254 --> 09:15.687
Beverly: Squishy.
Adult adam: <i> Until it did.</i>

09:15.689 --> 09:19.291
Look who I found
moseying around
the balloon corral.

09:19.293 --> 09:21.493
It's cowboy josh,
and today, he's gonna...

09:21.495 --> 09:23.628
Oh! Sweet creamed corn!

09:23.630 --> 09:24.829
Adult adam:
<i> It was either think fast</i>

09:24.831 --> 09:26.731
<i> Or be grounded</i>
<i> for the rest of my life.</i>

09:26.733 --> 09:29.000
I think
it was the "o" dip.

09:30.202 --> 09:33.138
Adult adam:
<i> And grounded it was.</i>

09:33.506 --> 09:36.274
I'd like to thank you all
for coming to this meeting

09:36.276 --> 09:37.976
On such short notice.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.144
Let me begin by saying

09:39.146 --> 09:42.514
I'm not here today
as principal ball.

09:42.516 --> 09:46.051
I'm just earl,
concerned parent.

09:46.053 --> 09:47.452
Understood, earl.

09:47.454 --> 09:48.687
(inhales deeply)

09:48.689 --> 09:50.121
I know you all have
some questions

09:50.123 --> 09:52.757
About the messy incident
that took place

09:52.759 --> 09:53.959
In our basement
this weekend,

09:53.961 --> 09:58.263
But let's agree
to have an open dialogue,

09:58.265 --> 10:00.699
Free of any
finger-pointing, okay?

10:00.701 --> 10:03.935
That said, I blame
you and you and you

10:03.937 --> 10:04.869
And, back up, you.

10:04.871 --> 10:06.771
Okay, okay.
Let's calm down.

10:06.773 --> 10:10.542
Our kids only got into
one of my unfermented batches,

10:10.544 --> 10:13.445
So, luckily,
they just drank pure mold.

10:13.447 --> 10:13.979
Oh, no!

10:13.981 --> 10:16.348
You will not lump adam
in with your band
of beer sippers.

10:16.350 --> 10:20.585
He didn't get sick,
which means he never
drank the mold.

10:20.587 --> 10:22.621
Oh, please, I've seen
adam doing horseplay

10:22.623 --> 10:26.157
When I have specifically
requested no horseplay.

10:26.159 --> 10:27.225
He's no angel.

10:27.227 --> 10:27.826
Oh, he is an angel.

10:27.828 --> 10:31.096
He could literally
sprout wings and take flight
at any moment!

10:31.098 --> 10:32.731
I know dave kim
better than anyone,

10:32.733 --> 10:34.866
And there's no way
he'd ever drink a beer,

10:34.868 --> 10:38.069
Unless he was
peer-pressured.

10:38.071 --> 10:39.304
Don't you point at me.

10:39.306 --> 10:39.938
From what I heard,

10:39.940 --> 10:42.574
Your little smokey the bear
brought a pipe.

10:42.576 --> 10:43.208
My son hurt no one

10:43.210 --> 10:45.577
And looked like
an elegant ship captain.

10:45.579 --> 10:46.645
Adult adam: <i> And with that,</i>

10:46.647 --> 10:47.779
<i> The open dialogue</i>
<i> free of finger-pointing</i>

10:47.781 --> 10:50.882
<i> Broke down into</i>
<i> a profanity-laced</i>
<i> free-for-all.</i>

10:50.884 --> 10:53.818
<i> This absurdity went on</i>
<i> for another 25 minutes.</i>

10:53.820 --> 10:56.021
(all shouting)
indoor voices, everybody!

10:56.023 --> 10:58.990
Adult adam: <i> And absolutely</i>
<i> nothing was accomplished.</i>

10:58.992 --> 10:59.858
Now, that's enough!

10:59.860 --> 11:03.728
It seems there is
only one thing
we can all agree on,

11:03.730 --> 11:05.964
And that is that
the goldberg sleepover

11:05.966 --> 11:09.401
Was the last time
our boys ever hang out.

11:09.403 --> 11:11.002
Agreed.
Fine with me.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.171
Wait, the last time?

11:13.173 --> 11:14.105
What does that mean?

11:14.107 --> 11:16.041
It means we separate
our little drinking buddies

11:16.043 --> 11:17.342
Before they end up
as winos on the street.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.811
Adult adam:
<i> While my social life</i>
<i> was being dismantled,</i>

11:19.813 --> 11:22.047
<i> Erica and barry's plan</i>
<i> was coming together,</i>

11:22.049 --> 11:24.582
<i> Steal a song</i>
<i> and pass it off as their own.</i>

11:24.584 --> 11:25.650
<i> ¶ now that it's done</i>

11:25.652 --> 11:29.521
<i> ¶ I hope you don't mind,</i>
<i> I hope you don't mind</i>

11:29.523 --> 11:31.589
<i> ¶ that I put down in words</i>

11:31.591 --> 11:35.760
(rapping)
<i> ¶ words, words,</i>
<i> adjectives and verbs</i>

11:35.762 --> 11:40.165
<i> ¶ how wonderful life is</i>

11:40.167 --> 11:44.769
<i> ¶ now you're in the world ¶</i>

11:44.771 --> 11:46.337
That was incredible.

11:46.339 --> 11:49.674
Yeah? You really like
our original song

11:49.676 --> 11:51.042
That we wrote together?

11:51.044 --> 11:51.576
I really do.

11:51.578 --> 11:53.611
I think we proved that
we deserve a cd player.

11:53.613 --> 11:55.880
You mean elton john
deserves a cd player.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.415
He knows the song.
He knows the song.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.551
You know the song?
Of course
I know the song!

11:59.553 --> 12:01.686
But you don't
listen to music.

12:01.688 --> 12:02.520
But I live on earth!

12:02.522 --> 12:04.856
You do realize
when elton john says

12:04.858 --> 12:07.258
"you can tell everybody
that this is your song,"

12:07.260 --> 12:10.395
It's not actually
your song, right?

12:10.397 --> 12:11.463
Okay, so maybe we lied,

12:11.465 --> 12:14.499
But we did write
an original masterpiece.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.167
Erica, quick,
play <i> love ninja.</i>

12:16.169 --> 12:17.736
Please, no <i> love ninja.</i>

12:17.738 --> 12:19.904
Let's make this simple.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.574
You're not getting
a cd player.

12:22.576 --> 12:26.878
I hereby declare this
a cassette house.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.546
So it is written.

12:28.548 --> 12:30.482
So it is done.

12:31.684 --> 12:34.452
You were right, pops.
He'll never understand.

12:34.454 --> 12:36.154
The man
just doesn't get music.

12:36.156 --> 12:38.123
Did you ever stop
to think why?

12:38.125 --> 12:41.726
When your dad was your age,
there was no music.

12:41.728 --> 12:43.328
'cause it wasn't
invented yet.

12:43.330 --> 12:45.530
No. There was
no time for music.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.165
Back then,
his father gave him nothing.

12:47.167 --> 12:51.169
Your dad's only "thing"
was raising
his little brother.

12:51.171 --> 12:54.539
Maybe you should think about
what he sacrificed

12:54.541 --> 12:55.707
And give him
something back.

12:55.709 --> 12:58.877
Adult adam: <i> While barry</i>
<i> and erica were realizing</i>
<i> the error of their ways,</i>

12:58.879 --> 13:02.113
<i> My friends and I were</i>
<i> still being punished for ours.</i>

13:02.115 --> 13:04.082
Hey, guys.
Hello.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.283
Hi.
Yo.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.451
How was everyone's day?

13:06.453 --> 13:07.852
Don't put us
in this position, dude.

13:07.854 --> 13:10.588
You know we can't
exchange pleasantries.

13:10.590 --> 13:13.391
Well, I miss you guys.

13:13.393 --> 13:14.425
Even you, dave kim.

13:14.427 --> 13:16.561
Who's that talking?
What's happening?

13:16.563 --> 13:19.364
You know what?
I'm not ready
to lose you dudes.

13:19.366 --> 13:20.365
I don't care
what my mom thinks.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.567
She thinks we're a band
of alcoholic roughnecks

13:22.569 --> 13:24.736
And you're a snuggly,
little angel.

13:24.738 --> 13:28.072
Then it's time I show her
this angel has fallen.

13:28.074 --> 13:30.608
What angel?
What's happening?

13:30.610 --> 13:33.044
Adult adam: <i> It was go time.</i>

13:33.046 --> 13:34.212
We need to talk, lady!

13:34.214 --> 13:35.847
Okay, well,
before you start stomping

13:35.849 --> 13:37.348
Your little buster browns,
you need to know

13:37.350 --> 13:39.884
I'm not the one who wanted
you guys to stop hanging out.

13:39.886 --> 13:43.021
Oh, please. Thanks to you,
I lost all of my friends.

13:43.023 --> 13:44.222
Well, maybe
it was for the best.

13:44.224 --> 13:48.393
I mean, those bad apples did
ruin my angel's slumber party.

13:48.395 --> 13:51.362
They're not bad apples.
And I'm no angel.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.932
Of course you are.
You didn't drink the mold.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.401
Well, I was going to
drink the mold.

13:56.403 --> 13:57.869
But you drank no mold.

13:57.871 --> 14:00.138
I'll drink the mold
right now.

14:00.140 --> 14:03.508
Adult adam:
<i> Drink the mold, I would,</i>
<i> and nothing would stop me.</i>

14:03.510 --> 14:06.644
Don't you dare
drink that mold!

14:06.646 --> 14:09.614
Consider this mold dranken.

14:09.616 --> 14:11.082
(gasps)

14:11.750 --> 14:13.117
Cuddle bear, no.

14:13.119 --> 14:15.086
You drank the mold!

14:15.088 --> 14:15.787
But I'm glad I did.

14:15.789 --> 14:18.523
Because now you see me
for what I am,

14:18.924 --> 14:20.658
A regular kid,

14:20.660 --> 14:21.426
Who needs a bathroom.

14:21.428 --> 14:23.361
Adult adam: W<i> hile I could</i>
<i> no longer ignore the nausea,</i>

14:23.363 --> 14:24.696
<i> Erica and barry</i>
<i> listened to pops</i>

14:24.698 --> 14:26.431
<i> And decided</i>
<i> to give back to my dad.</i>

14:26.433 --> 14:29.100
Barry: Hey!
There's the merman!

14:29.102 --> 14:31.369
Shedding those slacks
like a champ.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.537
What the hell is that?

14:32.539 --> 14:33.872
That is your new cd player.

14:33.874 --> 14:36.174
(angelic music plays)
it's a marantz ta-100

14:36.176 --> 14:38.910
With tuner, equalizer,
and monster speakers.

14:38.912 --> 14:40.178
This is for me?

14:40.180 --> 14:40.979
Sure is.
Barry: Yep.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.780
The thing you've been
desperate to get?

14:42.782 --> 14:44.682
Absolutely.
That is correct.

14:44.684 --> 14:45.650
Was this your idea?

14:45.652 --> 14:47.151
I don't even know anymore.

14:47.153 --> 14:48.586
Actually,
pops reminded us about

14:48.588 --> 14:51.456
How much you had
to sacrifice as a kid.

14:51.458 --> 14:52.190
So we did the same.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.792
And we traded in
all the stuff
you ever bought us

14:54.794 --> 14:55.660
For this one cd player.

14:55.662 --> 14:58.463
Now we, too, know
what it's like to suffer.

14:58.465 --> 15:02.100
I sacrificed my unused stilts
and abandoned aquarium,

15:02.102 --> 15:05.203
Just like you sacrificed
your whole childhood

15:05.205 --> 15:07.038
To raise your brother.
We are the same.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.440
Of course, if you want to
let us listen to it from

15:09.442 --> 15:10.441
Time to time,
we won't stop you.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.844
But that's up to you,
'cause this is yours.

15:12.846 --> 15:14.846
Yeah!
Unless you're not home.

15:14.848 --> 15:15.513
Then it's ours.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.315
So, what we have here
is a self-gift.

15:17.317 --> 15:18.850
A what, now?
A self-gift.

15:18.852 --> 15:20.752
You bought it for you
but gave it to me.

15:20.754 --> 15:22.620
This was not
a self-gift!

15:22.622 --> 15:26.691
Fine! If it really is mine,
then you can't use it ever.

15:26.693 --> 15:27.759
No way!
You can't do that!

15:27.761 --> 15:30.361
What about sharing?
We need to learn
life lessons.

15:30.363 --> 15:33.965
Oh, that's what this is.
It's mine, all of it.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.233
Oh, what you got
playing here?

15:35.235 --> 15:37.602
That's my rare, imported
public enemy cd!

15:37.604 --> 15:39.637
You can't touch that.
You hate rap.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.906
Not anymore,
'cause it's mine.

15:41.908 --> 15:43.374
What?

15:43.776 --> 15:46.044
Oh, boy.
That's aggressive.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.312
Those guys are angry!

15:47.314 --> 15:50.748
I don't know what about,
and I don't care.

15:50.750 --> 15:51.783
But I'm on board!

15:51.785 --> 15:54.152
<i> Fight the power</i> is my jam,
not yours!

15:54.154 --> 15:55.753
Well, now I fight the power!

15:55.755 --> 15:58.222
You can't fight the power.
You are the power.

15:58.224 --> 15:59.457
Murray: No. You are.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.992
And chuck d agrees.

16:00.994 --> 16:03.861
Don't you dare
say chuck d's name!

16:03.863 --> 16:07.065
Oh, I'll say it.
And I'll say
"professor griff,"

16:07.067 --> 16:09.467
And "terminator x,"
and "flavor flav."

16:09.469 --> 16:12.570
They all agree that
you're the power
worth fighting!

16:12.572 --> 16:16.574
You have no idea how much
that hurts my feelings!

16:16.942 --> 16:19.177
I am not as emotional
about chuck d,

16:19.179 --> 16:21.779
But I am really upset
about the stereo.

16:21.781 --> 16:25.683
Adult adam: <i> While my dad</i>
<i> had intended to teach</i>
<i> erica and barry a lesson,</i>

16:25.685 --> 16:30.021
<i> All he did was turn himself</i>
<i> into a real public enemy.</i>

16:30.489 --> 16:32.256
<i> It had been one day</i>
<i> since I drank the mold,</i>

16:32.258 --> 16:34.759
<i> And my mom had finally</i>
<i> accepted that I was no better</i>

16:34.761 --> 16:36.728
<i> Than the other beer-sippers.</i>

16:36.730 --> 16:39.964
Hello, everyone.
Thanks for coming.

16:40.099 --> 16:41.366
Uh, last time
we were all here,

16:41.368 --> 16:44.102
There was a lot
of finger-pointing,

16:44.104 --> 16:45.536
Mostly by me.

16:45.538 --> 16:46.537
But I just want
to say that

16:46.539 --> 16:48.473
Earl's idea
to keep our kids apart

16:48.475 --> 16:50.508
Is the stupidest thing
he's done

16:50.510 --> 16:53.044
Since mandatory shorts day
last June.

16:53.046 --> 16:54.512
Hey, there was
a heat wave.

16:54.514 --> 16:55.046
Shh.

16:55.048 --> 16:58.750
Point is, I think our kids
should be friends again.

16:58.752 --> 16:59.817
And you're not worried
that our band

16:59.819 --> 17:02.620
Of crazed suburban
hooligans will corrupt
your little angel?

17:02.622 --> 17:06.124
Look, I realize
they're not monsters.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.658
They're just growing up.

17:07.660 --> 17:11.796
Which means they're still
sweet and cute and kind.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.765
But now they're also
little (bleep)sticks

17:13.767 --> 17:14.866
That need to be watched
at every turn.

17:14.868 --> 17:19.303
Why did they have to
turn slumber parties
into sleepovers?

17:19.305 --> 17:20.438
They were so adorable

17:20.440 --> 17:22.140
Snuggled up
in those sleeping bags.

17:22.142 --> 17:24.342
I don't even punish garry
to his room anymore.

17:24.344 --> 17:27.412
My wife and I,
we just lock ourselves
in the bedroom,

17:27.414 --> 17:29.247
Let him have
the run of the house.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.983
Growing up is so hard on them,
you know?

17:31.985 --> 17:33.484
They need each other.

17:33.486 --> 17:34.018
They really do.

17:34.020 --> 17:37.021
But the truth is,
we need each other, too.

17:37.023 --> 17:38.256
We can't do this alone.

17:38.258 --> 17:41.959
So from here on out,
we're a united front.

17:41.961 --> 17:42.693
What do you say?

17:42.695 --> 17:46.697
Adult adam: <i> That day,</i>
<i> our parents finally found</i>
<i> some real common ground.</i>

17:46.699 --> 17:49.233
<i> Back at home, my mom decided</i>
<i> to make things right</i>

17:49.235 --> 17:50.935
<i> With her grounded son.</i>
(knock on door)

17:50.937 --> 17:53.137
Hey, schmoo.
How you feeling?

17:53.139 --> 17:56.607
I'm regretting my decision
to drink the mold.

17:56.942 --> 17:59.644
Well, when
you feel better, um...

17:59.646 --> 18:00.878
These are for the arcade.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.681
Thought you could
have the birthday
you actually wanted.

18:03.683 --> 18:07.785
Thanks, but there's no point
in playing air hockey alone.

18:08.320 --> 18:09.720
(smacks lips)

18:09.722 --> 18:11.389
About that...

18:11.391 --> 18:14.392
I had a chat
with the other parents.

18:14.394 --> 18:15.259
The ban's been lifted.

18:15.261 --> 18:16.961
But I thought
those guys were bad apples.

18:16.963 --> 18:20.231
Well, you know what they say
about bad apples.

18:20.233 --> 18:21.199
They make the best pies.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.701
Adult adam:
<i> That wasn't a real saying,</i>

18:23.703 --> 18:24.769
<i> But it was my mom's way</i>
<i> of admitting</i>

18:24.771 --> 18:29.774
<i> That I was gonna grow up</i>
<i> whether she liked it or not.</i>

18:31.176 --> 18:31.742
Wait.

18:31.744 --> 18:34.412
<i> ¶ my gift is my song, and...</i>

18:34.414 --> 18:36.481
I know I'm in middle school
and all,

18:36.483 --> 18:40.318
But could you stay
and rub my upset tummy?

18:40.853 --> 18:41.786
You got it, angel.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.088
<i> ¶ and you can tell everybody</i>

18:44.356 --> 18:47.225
<i> ¶ this is your song</i>

18:47.392 --> 18:52.196
<i> ¶ it may be quite simple,</i>
<i> but now that it's done</i>

18:52.198 --> 18:55.500
Adult adam: <i> Truth is,</i>
<i> none of us</i>
<i> were perfect angels.</i>

18:55.502 --> 18:57.201
<i> But our parents</i>
<i> weren't perfect, either.</i>

18:57.203 --> 18:58.102
<i> ¶ I hope you don't mind</i>

18:58.104 --> 18:59.637
Adult adam: <i> That's the thing</i>
<i> about growing up,</i>

18:59.639 --> 19:03.307
<i> After a while, it's better</i>
<i> to accept the way things are</i>

19:03.309 --> 19:06.978
<i> Than to stay hung up</i>
<i> on the way things used to be.</i>

19:06.980 --> 19:10.181
<i> ¶ while you're in the world ¶</i>

19:10.183 --> 19:11.616
Adult adam:
<i> Which is why my dad decided</i>

19:11.618 --> 19:15.019
<i> To give a little something</i>
<i> back to erica and barry.</i>

19:15.021 --> 19:17.255
I know
this was a gift for me,

19:17.257 --> 19:19.657
But I think you'll get
more use out of it.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.292
Really? But I thought
that you said...

19:21.294 --> 19:25.062
Look, I know
I got a little bit crazy.

19:25.064 --> 19:27.765
Sometimes it's hard
because the two of you,

19:27.767 --> 19:31.002
Your lives are so different
than the way mine was.

19:31.004 --> 19:34.505
But truthfully,
that's the way I want it.

19:35.774 --> 19:39.177
Now go ahead,
enjoy your music.

19:39.179 --> 19:40.144
I know it's your thing.

19:40.146 --> 19:41.479
Adult adam:
<i> All it took was a cd player</i>

19:41.481 --> 19:44.081
<i> For my dad to stop punishing</i>
<i> his kids for his past</i>

19:44.083 --> 19:47.185
<i> And start supporting</i>
<i> their dreams for the future.</i>

19:47.187 --> 19:50.288
<i> As for my mom, she got</i>
<i> the support she always needed</i>

19:50.290 --> 19:51.088
<i> From her new group of friends.</i>

19:51.090 --> 19:54.425
<i> Once a month, our parents got</i>
<i> together for a homemade stout</i>

19:54.427 --> 19:57.962
<i> And to talk about the hell</i>
<i> we put them through.</i>

19:57.964 --> 20:00.865
<i> And me, I not only</i>
<i> got my old friends back,</i>

20:00.867 --> 20:03.167
<i> But I gained a new one.</i>

20:04.469 --> 20:06.604
<i> Sure, garry was cool</i>
<i> and I was far from it,</i>

20:06.606 --> 20:09.674
<i> But together,</i>
<i> we cooked up some memories</i>

20:09.676 --> 20:11.375
<i> That would last a lifetime.</i>

20:11.377 --> 20:15.313
(swedish accent)
welcome to <i> the swedish chef</i>
<i> cooking hour.</i>

20:15.315 --> 20:16.847
Bork, bork.

20:18.217 --> 20:22.353
(swedish accent)
first is monkey soup.

20:23.255 --> 20:25.590
Monkey... Monkey soup.

20:25.592 --> 20:27.825
(all grunting)

20:28.327 --> 20:29.827
No monkey!

20:29.829 --> 20:30.761
No monkey soup today!

20:30.763 --> 20:34.031
No monkey.
No monkey soup today!

20:37.569 --> 20:41.339
Dude, you got a discman?
That's unbelievable!

20:41.341 --> 20:45.042
I know! Look.
It's so small and sleek

20:45.044 --> 20:46.944
And fits in the palm
of both hands together.

20:46.946 --> 20:49.880
So, how is it?
Uh, it has some kinks.

20:49.882 --> 20:51.716
It skips a lot
if you run with it.

20:51.718 --> 20:54.085
Or walk, or breathe heavily.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.119
Negative thoughts
also affect it.

20:55.121 --> 20:59.190
That's nuts.
You're just listening wrong.
Let me try.

21:01.226 --> 21:03.761
Oh, wow. Yeah, that's...
That's skipping.

21:03.763 --> 21:04.562
Just... Just hold it steady.

21:04.564 --> 21:06.030
I can't.
God, it just keeps skipping.

21:06.032 --> 21:07.164
Try pressing it
to your body.

21:07.166 --> 21:10.101
Stop skipping
while I barely move!
It'll stabilize.

21:10.103 --> 21:10.801
Oh! I got it! Ha!

21:10.803 --> 21:13.204
The trick is to
fully extend your arm

21:13.206 --> 21:14.672
And hold it up
as high as you can.

21:14.674 --> 21:17.475
(chuckles)
yeah, this is awesome!

21:17.743 --> 21:21.045
Oh. No.
No, it's skipping again.
