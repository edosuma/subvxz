WEBVTT

00:05.239 --> 00:10.242
[ominous music building up]

01:43.604 --> 01:44.770
Behonkus.

01:50.878 --> 01:51.877
Behonkus.

01:55.216 --> 01:59.518
Behonkus, booty. Erica, get
your booty over here.

01:59.520 --> 02:02.688
Yeah, this is a couch
of love, a love seat.

02:02.690 --> 02:04.156
God dammit. No.

02:05.826 --> 02:08.160
[patting the sofa]

02:13.567 --> 02:15.400
-What's happening?
-Love.

02:15.402 --> 02:18.370
I'll have you know, you have
to memorize every single line

02:18.372 --> 02:20.606
to this cinematic masterpiece
before you graduate.

02:20.608 --> 02:24.243
We don't know what any of it
means, but Tori's communist
grandpa owns it for some reason.

02:24.245 --> 02:26.211
All right, yeah.

02:26.213 --> 02:30.482
He's probably, definitely
a communist but on an equally
important note,

02:30.484 --> 02:33.352
we would like to
officially welcome you
to your first river house trip

02:33.354 --> 02:35.921
-A.K.A. "Baby Shower Break."
-Baby Shower Break?

02:35.923 --> 02:38.624
Yeah! You know because this is
like our last hoorah together

02:38.626 --> 02:42.427
before you bring your new
freshman into our little Delta
family with rush.

02:42.429 --> 02:46.765
My little baby
Erica's all grown up.
I'm gonna be a grandma.

02:48.669 --> 02:53.739
So, enjoy some pregnancy wine
before you push that little
bastard out,

02:53.741 --> 02:56.875
though I'm sure that little
bastard will be great.

02:56.877 --> 02:59.878
You'll make a good choice,
just like Britt did with you.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.613
Aww.

03:01.615 --> 03:04.616
-Uh, are we playing a game?
-Shut up.

03:04.617 --> 03:07.618
Of course, we are!
Why else would I be wearing
my Christmas socks?

03:07.621 --> 03:10.222
I'm sorry, what socks
were those again?

03:10.224 --> 03:12.458
They're my competition socks.

03:12.459 --> 03:14.693
You wore those to like every
single house dinner last year.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.895
-Yeah, for purposes
of competition.
-Okay, Brittany.

03:16.897 --> 03:19.198
So anyway, we
will be playing several games,

03:19.200 --> 03:22.601
while at the same time paying
close attention to this landmark
in film history.

03:22.603 --> 03:25.804
So, whose team
do you want to be on?

03:29.476 --> 03:31.977
-I'll be with Britt.
-[Tori] Bitch! You're a bitch.

03:31.979 --> 03:35.647
Kidding. I love you all.
So, let's start, bitches.

03:35.649 --> 03:39.484
And I'll have you know, this is
my week off, so, I'm drinking
you dip-shits into the ground.

03:39.486 --> 03:40.686
What are the rules?

03:40.688 --> 03:41.753
I don't know.

03:42.957 --> 03:45.224
He hit a woman. Wine chug.

03:58.272 --> 04:01.273
[muted laughs]

04:18.791 --> 04:19.725
[Erica] Good morning.

04:36.710 --> 04:37.909
[Britt] Morning, little one.

04:47.021 --> 04:47.986
[Britt] I'd watch out.

04:49.290 --> 04:50.623
Why?

04:50.624 --> 04:51.957
[Britt] There might
be jellyfish in there.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.061
[Britt] You see any?

05:07.574 --> 05:08.774
I don't see anything.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.445
Tori will probably know.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.616
You ever been stung by one?

05:17.618 --> 05:20.819
[Britt] No. And I don't plan
on it. Have you?

05:20.821 --> 05:22.888
There aren't that
many in Detroit.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.957
[Britt] I smell sass.

06:19.680 --> 06:23.148
This part right here is
called the "Heel Stomp" and it's
the deepest part of the cove,

06:23.150 --> 06:25.951
but, more importantly, it's
where I learned to swim.

06:25.953 --> 06:26.885
Aw.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.553
Anyone care for a throwback?

06:29.456 --> 06:30.722
Let's swim, people!

06:30.724 --> 06:32.557
Are there jellyfish in there?

06:33.494 --> 06:34.459
I don't know.

06:34.461 --> 06:35.660
Yeah, I'm out.

06:37.131 --> 06:38.130
Erica?

06:41.168 --> 06:43.735
Would a tube work better
for you, princess?

06:43.737 --> 06:45.670
I mean if they're in
there they can still...

06:45.672 --> 06:47.839
You're fine in a tube.

06:47.840 --> 06:50.007
They're not known for jumping
unless those bastards
at SeaWorld force them to.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.512
So, who's going first?

06:53.514 --> 06:55.747
You've got this, Little.
Be the crash test dummy.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.583
Yeah, like shit. You just
nominated yourself.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.085
-I'll go.
-[Britt] Yeah, go Little.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.721
No. No. Man up, Brittany.

07:02.723 --> 07:06.792
Okay, fine. I'll go if you
stop calling me that.

07:06.794 --> 07:07.726
No deal.

07:10.464 --> 07:12.731
Take pictures for my parents!

07:14.835 --> 07:15.767
Wah!

07:18.739 --> 07:20.205
[Tori] Watch for her signals.

07:20.207 --> 07:21.206
[Erica] Yes, Captain.

07:28.215 --> 07:29.714
She says, "faster."

07:30.684 --> 07:31.616
Roger.

07:36.523 --> 07:40.225
[Erica] Woo! Go, Britt!

08:06.653 --> 08:07.886
Faster.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.622
Roger Dodger!

08:16.997 --> 08:18.497
She says, "faster."

08:19.666 --> 08:21.933
All right, I can do faster.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.675
She says, "slow down."

08:33.647 --> 08:34.813
Slower.

08:35.649 --> 08:37.649
I can't hear you,
it's too windy.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.284
[Erica] Oh, shit.

08:41.288 --> 08:42.953
Tori, she fell.

08:47.528 --> 08:48.527
Tori.

08:49.596 --> 08:51.963
Oh my God! She's fine.

08:51.965 --> 08:52.964
[Erica] Come on.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.735
It's a joke. Relax.

08:56.737 --> 08:58.904
[Britt] <i> Okay, now we're even.</i>

08:58.905 --> 09:01.072
[Britt] Man, you looked like you
were going to shit your pants
out there,

09:01.074 --> 09:03.775
but you held on longer
than I would have, though...

09:06.246 --> 09:11.750
[girls chattering]

09:13.086 --> 09:19.124
Hey. Team Britt
is winning tonight.
I've got the socks for it.

09:19.126 --> 09:21.993
Okay, Britt. She's
so unique. Wow.

09:21.995 --> 09:24.563
Oh, yeah.
It's awesome, Brittany.

09:24.565 --> 09:26.765
Hey, could you actually
stop calling me that?

09:26.767 --> 09:27.699
No.

09:29.002 --> 09:31.670
Mm! Kid smoking.

09:31.672 --> 09:34.606
[thunder roaring]

09:38.845 --> 09:40.946
All right, let's play this game.

09:40.948 --> 09:41.880
Shit.

09:42.783 --> 09:43.715
We need more cards.

09:43.717 --> 09:45.617
More cards? What is this game?

09:45.619 --> 09:49.688
-How dare you question the game!
-Shut up, shut up. I'm focusing.

09:49.690 --> 09:52.857
Oh wait! Before we start, you
should go upstairs and change
into your pajamas.

09:52.859 --> 09:53.792
Mm!

09:57.230 --> 09:58.196
Wait!

09:59.933 --> 10:04.269
Uh, actually yeah,
but choose a team first.

10:07.708 --> 10:08.673
I'll be on yours.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.727
[thud]

11:35.462 --> 11:37.962
-[knocking on door]
-Erica.

11:39.866 --> 11:42.367
-[knocking on door]
-Erica?

11:44.404 --> 11:46.204
[gasps]

12:02.222 --> 12:03.354
Oh God!

12:38.125 --> 12:39.057
[Britt] No.

12:40.227 --> 12:43.294
No. She's okay.
She's okay, right?

12:47.000 --> 12:48.166
She's okay, right?

12:51.805 --> 12:53.304
She's okay.

12:54.841 --> 12:56.007
She's fine.

12:56.877 --> 12:57.876
She's fine.

13:04.251 --> 13:07.852
[muttering]

13:09.289 --> 13:10.421
[Britt] What are you doing?

13:12.125 --> 13:13.091
[Britt] Tori?

14:17.591 --> 14:21.626
[Britt] No. We can't do this,
we have to call somebody!

14:21.628 --> 14:23.278
We can't call anyone.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.929
No! I think we can, we can
just explain to them...

14:24.931 --> 14:27.932
What can we explain?
That we killed her?

14:29.469 --> 14:30.568
We killed her.

14:33.106 --> 14:34.572
Something bad happened.

14:36.009 --> 14:37.141
She's gone,

14:38.612 --> 14:41.079
but we need to save
our lives now.

14:41.081 --> 14:42.647
Please, just wait
for a second! We can...

14:42.649 --> 14:45.283
Britt! Focus.

14:47.587 --> 14:49.120
She's not coming back,

14:50.290 --> 14:53.224
and we can cry later,
but we need to do this now.

14:56.596 --> 14:59.330
It was just an accident, Tori.

15:02.335 --> 15:04.986
Let's just call...

15:04.987 --> 15:07.638
We are fucked if we call
anyone! Do you understand?

15:09.542 --> 15:10.942
She's dead.

15:10.944 --> 15:17.081
Ruining our lives
isn't going to stop her
from being fucking dead.

15:20.553 --> 15:22.553
Something bad happened,

15:23.990 --> 15:25.156
and it happened,

15:26.226 --> 15:28.359
but we need to protect us now.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.329
It's what she would have wanted.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.098
No.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.133
Look, Erica!

16:09.436 --> 16:10.368
Tori.

16:10.370 --> 16:14.672
Get pillows. One for her head
and two for her feet,
to keep them elevated.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.699
Look at me. Look at me!

16:41.701 --> 16:45.003
Everything is fine. She's okay.

16:45.005 --> 16:45.770
Tori.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.638
Stop! She's fine.

16:49.275 --> 16:50.575
She's soaking wet.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.578
We're soaking wet.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.079
I'll think of something.

17:01.054 --> 17:03.654
Mom I... [mumbling]

17:03.656 --> 17:07.058
Erica. It's me, Tori.

17:07.761 --> 17:10.795
[Erica moaning] My head.

17:10.797 --> 17:16.534
Ugh! My neck! Oh, my neck!

17:16.536 --> 17:18.036
Britt, can you get her ice?

17:20.073 --> 17:22.773
[breathing rapidly]

17:24.711 --> 17:26.176
Erica, do you know
where you are?

17:26.179 --> 17:29.280
My head hurts.
My head-- my head hurts.

17:29.282 --> 17:34.052
Focus. Erica, focus. Do you
know where you are?

17:37.090 --> 17:39.057
I'm--

17:39.059 --> 17:42.593
at my friend's house--
my friend's house.

17:42.595 --> 17:45.830
Good. Good.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.473
-What happened?
-Do you remember your name?

17:55.475 --> 17:56.808
I was on a boat.

17:58.278 --> 17:59.477
Do you know your name?

18:00.313 --> 18:01.746
-Come on.
-Ah...

18:01.748 --> 18:03.414
Do you remember who you are?

18:07.487 --> 18:09.087
I'm Erica.

18:11.424 --> 18:14.092
It hurts really bad,
Tori! It hurts!

18:14.094 --> 18:15.493
Britt, come on!

18:15.495 --> 18:17.361
Argh!

18:21.101 --> 18:22.733
Erica, do you remember
what happened?

18:27.807 --> 18:28.840
No.

18:33.313 --> 18:36.747
-What happened?
-You had an accident.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.720
We just need you
to lay still, okay?

18:43.790 --> 18:46.457
I'm wet. I'm wet.

18:52.198 --> 18:54.132
[Tori] We're going to take you
up to Britt's room.

18:54.134 --> 18:56.167
We'll explain
everything in the morning.

18:56.169 --> 18:58.202
We just need to get you dry
and rested.

19:03.843 --> 19:06.511
[Erica moaning]

19:18.892 --> 19:21.826
[Erica]
You don't think I should go to
the hospital, just to be safe?

19:21.828 --> 19:24.529
[Tori]
No. It's storming too hard out.
We're going to keep you here.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.740
Can you change
into those yourself?

19:40.246 --> 19:41.179
Erica?

19:46.953 --> 19:47.885
Yeah.

19:51.191 --> 19:52.223
I'm okay.

19:54.627 --> 19:55.560
All right.

19:57.630 --> 20:02.300
Well, we'll be back up
so just change into them
and then don't fall asleep.

21:00.827 --> 21:04.929
[mumbling]

21:24.050 --> 21:28.019
[Britt and Tori arguing]

21:42.769 --> 21:44.969
Stop. She's fine.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.704
-No, she's really--
-She's not that...

21:57.850 --> 21:58.783
[Tori] Erica?

22:01.487 --> 22:02.486
[Erica] Everything.

22:04.691 --> 22:05.756
Everything.

22:08.027 --> 22:09.427
Everything.

22:16.069 --> 22:17.568
What the fuck?

22:21.541 --> 22:23.374
You were burying me.

22:33.853 --> 22:34.985
[Tori] Where are you going?

22:34.987 --> 22:37.621
I think I have to go.

22:38.558 --> 22:41.075
[Erica] Please.

22:41.076 --> 22:43.593
-I have to go.
I need to go home.
-Erica, stop. You're upset.

22:43.596 --> 22:45.996
Why? Why would you do that?

22:47.967 --> 22:50.668
Give me my phone.
I need my phone.

22:50.669 --> 22:53.370
We were just pulling a prank.
We didn't mean
for anything to happen.

22:53.373 --> 22:54.638
I just-- I need my phone.

22:56.509 --> 22:59.076
[Tori] Erica, if you tell
anyone, our lives are ruined.

22:59.078 --> 23:00.644
I want my phone!

23:04.150 --> 23:05.883
Britt, hold her down!

23:05.885 --> 23:09.954
[struggling noises]

23:24.837 --> 23:26.971
-Wait, let me go.
-Tori, what are we doing?

23:28.808 --> 23:29.740
I don't know.

23:30.810 --> 23:33.010
-Wait, let me go.
-[Britt] Tori.

23:33.880 --> 23:35.846
We can't let her go.
We have to now.

23:35.848 --> 23:37.148
Just wait a second.
Just talk to me.

23:37.150 --> 23:39.417
Oh my God! Oh my God!

23:39.419 --> 23:41.819
Hey, I'm right here, okay?
I'm right here.

23:41.821 --> 23:43.654
I can fix this.
I just need time.

23:43.656 --> 23:45.756
What do you mean, fix this?

23:45.757 --> 23:47.857
I'm right here. Please, I'm
right here. I'm right here!

23:47.860 --> 23:49.693
I don't know. I don't know yet.

24:14.754 --> 24:16.821
[screaming]

24:41.013 --> 24:45.182
[Tori] You need to get up.
Come on. Come on.

25:39.739 --> 25:41.138
Anyone want breakfast?

25:45.978 --> 25:46.911
No?

25:51.117 --> 25:52.082
Okay.

25:54.220 --> 25:55.252
Shit.

26:19.979 --> 26:22.846
Britt. I'm gonna need
you in here for this.

26:26.819 --> 26:27.885
So,

26:29.855 --> 26:32.189
things got a bit dramatic
last night,

26:32.191 --> 26:35.159
but I just wanna say that I'm so
happy that you're okay.

26:35.161 --> 26:37.962
-Tori, please untie me.
-Just don't interrupt me.

26:39.265 --> 26:41.231
We're going to keep you
in the chair for now,

26:41.233 --> 26:43.167
but we need you to help us.

26:46.339 --> 26:47.838
You're not serious.

26:49.809 --> 26:52.176
Guys, this hurts.
This really fucking hurts.

26:52.178 --> 26:55.145
-No, I have to go to a hospital.
-Stop yelling.

26:55.147 --> 26:57.948
You're in a chair,
you're not on fire.

26:59.385 --> 27:01.218
I'm sorry
that this happened to you,

27:02.154 --> 27:05.289
but I can't let you go,
you understand?

27:07.059 --> 27:10.160
-I need to know that you're
not going to tell anyone.
-I'm not going to tell anyone.

27:10.162 --> 27:11.128
I know.

27:12.131 --> 27:13.163
I believe you,

27:15.001 --> 27:17.735
but I just need to find
a way to be sure.

27:20.406 --> 27:24.274
So, help us and then we
can get back to having fun.

27:31.651 --> 27:33.684
You know,
believe it or not, Erica,

27:34.920 --> 27:36.186
we're in this together.

27:42.328 --> 27:44.061
What if I have to go
to the bathroom?

27:45.031 --> 27:46.096
Well, just yell.

27:46.098 --> 27:47.831
I have to go to the bathroom.

28:06.419 --> 28:07.384
Watch her.

30:59.592 --> 31:01.024
I guess now we know.

31:50.643 --> 31:54.278
[music playing in earphones]
¶<i> Lead me astray</i> ¶

31:57.249 --> 31:59.182
¶<i> Go tell</i> ¶

32:01.487 --> 32:04.554
¶<i> My baby sister</i> ¶

32:06.692 --> 32:08.358
¶<i> Don't...</i> ¶

32:46.098 --> 32:50.300
What the fuck? He didn't say
anything about workers.

32:50.302 --> 32:52.302
[Britt] They must be here
because of the storm.

32:52.304 --> 32:54.471
[Tori] Fuck. Do you think
that they saw her?

32:54.473 --> 32:56.373
I mean, they would be
doing something, right?

32:56.375 --> 32:58.508
[knocking on door]

32:59.378 --> 33:00.577
[Tori] Well, shit.

33:06.251 --> 33:09.086
Good afternoon, my name's
Calvin and you must be Tori.

33:09.088 --> 33:13.256
-Yeah.
-Well, it's so nice to finally
meet you, may I step in?

33:15.694 --> 33:16.626
Sure.

33:19.164 --> 33:23.033
[trying to scream]

33:23.035 --> 33:26.103
[Calvin] Funny thing is,
last time we met, you were
about up to my ankles.

33:26.105 --> 33:29.272
-[music playing]
-[Calvin] Anyhow, I should
probably tell you why I'm here.

33:29.274 --> 33:30.207
We've got some...

33:37.249 --> 33:39.049
[Calvin]
We've got another guy out front,

33:39.051 --> 33:40.751
taking care of one that's
blocking the driveway

33:40.753 --> 33:43.253
so you're going to hear
a little noise, but...

34:09.782 --> 34:13.717
[stifled moans]

34:16.321 --> 34:19.489
[Calvin] Another fella
out front, working on one that's
blocking the driveway.

34:19.491 --> 34:22.559
We get some
pretty bad storms here,
but nothing like that one.

34:22.561 --> 34:25.529
Yeah. Yeah, I bet. Yeah.

34:25.531 --> 34:28.197
Uh thank you, it was really
nice meeting you.

34:28.199 --> 34:31.568
My pleasure, little lady. So
where are you going to school?

34:38.377 --> 34:40.744
[mouthing]

34:45.484 --> 34:47.417
[turning up the music]

34:47.418 --> 34:50.152
-It was really nice to meet you.
-Everything good here?

34:53.625 --> 34:55.425
You weren't expecting
us, were you?

34:56.661 --> 34:57.861
What?

34:59.364 --> 35:02.416
Oh heck, I won't tell
your granddaddy.

35:02.417 --> 35:05.469
I just want to make sure you
know these boys and they're not
up to something stupid.

35:05.471 --> 35:09.806
It's my boyfriend and his
friends. They're from school.
Please don't tell my grandpa.

35:09.808 --> 35:13.376
Oh, don't you worry about it.
A hundred years ago,
I was a boy, myself.

35:25.891 --> 35:28.725
[game buzzing]

35:30.863 --> 35:32.796
[inhaling and coughing]

35:32.798 --> 35:34.698
-Let me go.
-[Tori] What happened in there?

35:35.601 --> 35:37.200
[Tori] Did they just fall?

35:38.670 --> 35:41.638
Work with us!
It's not like you're doing
anything else!

35:42.641 --> 35:43.640
God!

36:08.867 --> 36:11.535
Hi. Yes, this is
his granddaughter.

36:12.538 --> 36:15.672
No, absolutely wonderful.

36:15.673 --> 36:18.807
<i> I just talked to Grandpa Craig</i>
<i> and he said that since more</i>
<i> storms are coming,</i>

36:18.810 --> 36:21.745
<i>we're just going to hold off on</i>
<i>the yard service until the end.</i>

36:24.950 --> 36:27.751
Ah-ha. Hm-hm.

36:29.555 --> 36:31.621
You too. Okay, buh-bye!

39:55.127 --> 39:56.726
Did you take my phone?

39:57.996 --> 39:59.496
Did you take everything?

40:04.569 --> 40:05.502
Hey!

40:05.504 --> 40:09.572
Do you even have a plan,
or have you just gone
completely insane?

40:12.544 --> 40:14.477
[Tori]
Got someone you need to call?

40:17.182 --> 40:19.149
We can't do this to her.

40:20.652 --> 40:21.818
It's Erica.

40:24.689 --> 40:26.489
This has to stop!

40:26.491 --> 40:28.425
Can we skip this fucking part?

40:28.427 --> 40:31.194
Can we skip this whole bit
where you think you're
innocent in this?

40:31.196 --> 40:34.431
I'm a fucking monster
and you're just a bystander?

40:35.100 --> 40:39.536
How about the part
where we go to fucking jail
over an accident?

40:39.538 --> 40:44.841
The constant fucking work
that I've done my entire life
is just ruined?

40:47.512 --> 40:52.482
We have three days, Britt,
to figure this shit out
so wake the fuck up!

40:54.186 --> 40:55.885
It doesn't end here.

40:57.589 --> 40:58.688
It can't.

41:01.993 --> 41:04.027
So, what do you think
is going to happen?

41:05.530 --> 41:09.132
Is she just going to start
loving us again and forget
about this whole thing?

41:10.469 --> 41:13.503
Are we just waiting it out?

41:15.173 --> 41:17.907
Please just tell me
what the end game is.

41:19.945 --> 41:22.512
We have the endgame, Britt.

41:24.015 --> 41:26.516
I just would really
rather change it.

42:10.095 --> 42:13.229
[water sizzling]

43:10.188 --> 43:14.123
I learned this from <i> Elmo's</i>
<i> World</i> . I'm very classy.

43:22.133 --> 43:25.668
So, I heard you're going
to Prague next year.

43:25.670 --> 43:28.171
You'll have to learn proper
spaghetti eating before you go.

43:32.210 --> 43:35.311
I don't know if spaghetti is
actually a thing there.

43:35.313 --> 43:37.146
I don't know anything
about Prague.

43:37.148 --> 43:40.950
But it'll be great
to hear about.

43:40.952 --> 43:44.754
I mean, that'll be fun.
That'll be a really
good experience for you.

45:53.284 --> 45:54.217
[Erica] Please.

45:56.321 --> 45:58.321
Please. Tori.

46:01.092 --> 46:03.826
Tori, come on,
I need food or something.

46:09.834 --> 46:10.833
Please.

46:13.004 --> 46:14.003
Please.

46:22.013 --> 46:22.945
Hello.

46:42.367 --> 46:44.033
Tori can I please
have some more?

46:45.436 --> 46:46.402
Tori,

46:48.406 --> 46:50.072
can I have some
more water?

46:51.943 --> 46:52.875
Please.

47:03.188 --> 47:05.021
I'm sorry.

47:05.023 --> 47:09.292
I'm so sorry.
I didn't want any
of this to happen to you.

47:13.398 --> 47:14.831
Please forgive me.

47:15.900 --> 47:17.533
I thought you were my friend.

47:19.470 --> 47:23.139
-We had to. Things just
got out of hand.
-You're a coward.

47:25.443 --> 47:27.610
Do you think you would have
done any differently?

47:29.380 --> 47:32.048
I never would have done
this to anyone.

47:34.552 --> 47:35.852
I don't believe you.

47:38.056 --> 47:39.555
Bad shit happens

47:40.625 --> 47:43.125
and that just as easily
could have been me.

47:43.127 --> 47:45.394
I know you
and I've watched you.

47:45.396 --> 47:47.930
Oh, yeah? What do you
know about me?

47:47.932 --> 47:50.133
Go ahead.

47:50.134 --> 47:52.335
I know that you definitely
wouldn't have done
anything for me.

47:53.271 --> 47:55.638
Not if it meant going
against your idol.

47:58.243 --> 47:59.375
You know what?

48:02.480 --> 48:04.280
You're the lucky
one in that chair.

48:06.351 --> 48:10.987
This whole thing is out
of your hands, so you just get
to sit there and relax.

48:12.924 --> 48:13.956
Not me.

48:15.560 --> 48:17.226
So, why don't you make
yourself useful

48:17.228 --> 48:19.562
and think about what you would
do if you were me?

48:19.564 --> 48:22.198
What you would actually do,

48:22.200 --> 48:24.467
because I know what I'd be
doing if I were you.

48:26.404 --> 48:27.670
I never would have
done this to you.

48:32.010 --> 48:33.309
But I would now.

49:24.128 --> 49:25.695
[thud]

51:54.212 --> 51:57.580
[buzzing]

52:03.788 --> 52:07.690
[buzzing and thumping]

53:13.324 --> 53:15.824
[Tori] Come on!
Get in the fucking car.

54:41.846 --> 54:43.045
[Tori] There she is.

54:46.050 --> 54:47.583
[Tori] Son of a bitch.

54:49.487 --> 54:54.323
[Tori yelling] Where ya going?
There's nobody that way!

54:56.961 --> 54:58.827
Aw, atta girl!

55:00.598 --> 55:03.699
Come on bitch, run!

55:04.602 --> 55:06.502
You're doing great!

55:07.838 --> 55:09.905
Run, bitch, run!

55:11.075 --> 55:13.809
Run, bitch, run!

55:14.812 --> 55:16.845
Run, bitch, run!

55:16.847 --> 55:18.981
Run, bitch, run!

55:18.983 --> 55:21.417
Run, bitch, run!

55:21.419 --> 55:24.653
Oh, my fucking hero!

55:26.390 --> 55:27.856
Okay, Britt, get out.

55:28.859 --> 55:30.426
Britt, get out!

55:34.799 --> 55:38.767
Erica, please, just get
in the car. Please? Come on.

55:38.769 --> 55:40.069
[Tori] Britt, just grab her!

55:42.573 --> 55:44.506
What the fuck are you doing?

55:46.544 --> 55:47.676
Brittany!

55:49.880 --> 55:52.081
[Tori] Move! Move!

55:52.083 --> 55:55.084
[car running and stopping]

56:01.525 --> 56:02.558
[Tori] Fuck!

56:02.559 --> 56:03.592
[Tori]
It's stuck. Go get the ATV!

56:14.505 --> 56:16.905
Get up! Keep running!

56:16.907 --> 56:18.040
[firing a shot]

56:19.076 --> 56:20.709
I'm not fucking around!

56:22.012 --> 56:24.680
Keep going.
You like to run? Run.

56:24.682 --> 56:25.848
-[shooting]
-Ah!

57:17.535 --> 57:18.567
More.

57:28.679 --> 57:29.611
More.

57:39.190 --> 57:40.589
More.

58:04.849 --> 58:05.981
[knocking on door]

58:08.886 --> 58:10.619
[knocking on door]

58:25.736 --> 58:26.969
When this is over,

58:28.038 --> 58:29.605
whatever happens,

58:30.274 --> 58:32.174
we're never going
to see each other again.

58:34.912 --> 58:36.678
Yeah. Okay.

58:37.548 --> 58:38.514
I don't care.

58:39.717 --> 58:44.586
I need to know if we have
a plan. A real plan.

58:44.588 --> 58:46.121
I'm working on it.

58:46.123 --> 58:47.756
That's not good enough.

58:59.737 --> 59:01.303
I think Calvin knows.

59:04.642 --> 59:06.708
What do you mean? Is that him?

59:10.080 --> 59:11.013
Is that him?

59:19.790 --> 59:22.658
You think he knows? Why
do you think he knows?

59:25.029 --> 59:26.728
A truck's been coming by.

59:28.332 --> 59:29.865
So what if he knows?

59:31.268 --> 59:32.734
What do we do about it?

59:32.736 --> 59:34.636
We need to figure this out.

59:34.638 --> 59:36.605
That's what I'm doing.

59:36.607 --> 59:39.241
I don't think I trust
you, to be honest.

59:41.312 --> 59:42.878
Yeah. Okay.

59:44.715 --> 59:45.647
What?

59:47.818 --> 59:48.750
Nothing.

59:55.726 --> 59:57.960
You know that place
where I learned to swim,

59:58.996 --> 01:00:00.228
in the middle of the cove?

01:00:04.001 --> 01:00:05.901
Well, Grandpa tried
to teach me at shore.

01:00:07.004 --> 01:00:11.273
So, he'd hold his arms out,
and I'd paddle towards him,

01:00:11.275 --> 01:00:13.675
and he'd back away slowly.

01:00:15.679 --> 01:00:17.245
And I'd panic of course,

01:00:18.849 --> 01:00:21.183
but my brothers were always
there to jump in after me

01:00:22.052 --> 01:00:23.952
even though
Grandpa yelled at them for it.

01:00:26.991 --> 01:00:28.090
And you know what?

01:00:29.727 --> 01:00:32.227
I didn't learn to fucking swim.

01:00:35.232 --> 01:00:38.667
So, he took me out on the boat,
out to where I took you.

01:00:42.172 --> 01:00:43.939
He gave me a big hug

01:00:43.941 --> 01:00:46.108
for the first time
in I don't know when.

01:00:48.379 --> 01:00:51.179
And then he picked me up,
he threw me over the side,

01:00:51.181 --> 01:00:55.183
and then he drove away so fast
that my brothers didn't even
have time to jump in after me.

01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:58.186
And he left me there

01:01:00.024 --> 01:01:01.690
in the deepest part.

01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:04.960
And he didn't come back
for a few minutes.

01:01:07.331 --> 01:01:11.266
Sure, as hell, I learned to swim
in under thirty seconds.

01:01:13.937 --> 01:01:16.338
You're nearing
the deep end, Brittany.

01:01:19.410 --> 01:01:20.742
Start paddling.

01:01:27.251 --> 01:01:28.383
You wanna see the plan?

01:01:32.256 --> 01:01:33.188
Come with me.

01:02:29.446 --> 01:02:31.747
All right. I think I'm funny.

01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:34.783
I wonder how you...

01:02:34.785 --> 01:02:37.886
No. No. Sorry, not sorry.

01:02:37.888 --> 01:02:40.405
We're not doing this tonight.

01:02:40.406 --> 01:02:42.923
Jesus, like I get it, but it
kinda just is what it is
at this point.

01:02:48.465 --> 01:02:50.499
Is that just from a few days?

01:02:50.501 --> 01:02:52.801
Jeez, you drew
a genetic short straw.

01:02:52.803 --> 01:02:56.004
I feel for you girl, but
I am not shaving them.

01:02:56.006 --> 01:02:58.940
I will, however,
fix your gasoline breath

01:02:58.942 --> 01:03:00.408
because you're stinking
up the place.

01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:02.878
Think that one SpongeBob episode
where SpongeBob--

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.913
well, you know
what I'm talking about.

01:03:35.546 --> 01:03:36.478
Open.

01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:47.222
Tongue.

01:03:55.899 --> 01:03:57.065
[choking]

01:03:59.102 --> 01:04:00.969
Really? That's it?

01:04:27.397 --> 01:04:30.899
It's not looking good,
is it? This.

01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:37.272
No.

01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:42.244
Well, let's make
the most of it then.

01:04:42.246 --> 01:04:44.079
We came here
to have a week off.

01:05:05.302 --> 01:05:06.334
That'll do, pig.

01:05:15.512 --> 01:05:18.446
Yeah, that's something.
Your turn.

01:05:20.951 --> 01:05:22.450
Oh, for fuck's sake.

01:05:57.654 --> 01:05:59.721
[music playing]

01:05:59.723 --> 01:06:04.392
¶<i> But I'm a different man</i>
<i> When I think about</i> ¶

01:06:04.394 --> 01:06:08.997
¶<i> The way she broke my heart</i>
<i> Until the day she left</i> ¶

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:15.170
¶<i> I'm the part that loves her</i>
<i> And wants her for my own</i> ¶

01:06:15.172 --> 01:06:18.673
¶<i> I'm the part that hates her</i>
<i> 'Cause she's gone...</i> ¶

01:06:46.103 --> 01:06:47.135
I win!

01:06:48.205 --> 01:06:50.005
Fuck, yeah.

01:06:50.007 --> 01:06:51.139
T-Dog!

01:06:52.709 --> 01:06:54.342
I just keep winning.

01:06:54.344 --> 01:06:56.378
What ya got? What ya got?

01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:58.179
Ten of diamonds?

01:06:59.416 --> 01:07:01.383
You give the worst clues.

01:07:01.385 --> 01:07:03.184
Absolutely horrible.

01:07:03.186 --> 01:07:04.319
Do better.

01:07:16.333 --> 01:07:18.066
God, I'm exhausted.

01:07:19.102 --> 01:07:20.435
Are you exhausted?

01:07:24.574 --> 01:07:26.141
Yeah.

01:07:26.143 --> 01:07:27.308
I'm exhausted.

01:07:34.251 --> 01:07:35.183
Yeah,

01:07:37.421 --> 01:07:38.787
but you don't give up though.

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:45.460
I'm sorry that this had
to happen to you.

01:07:47.130 --> 01:07:48.563
I actually really like you.

01:07:50.267 --> 01:07:53.701
I've just been
working my whole life.

01:07:53.703 --> 01:07:58.106
It was all starting to come
together and then this.

01:07:59.342 --> 01:08:01.276
None of this needed to happen.

01:08:04.281 --> 01:08:05.213
Yeah.

01:08:06.383 --> 01:08:07.315
Maybe.

01:08:09.553 --> 01:08:11.286
But this part
doesn't come yet.

01:08:13.256 --> 01:08:17.625
You've got a fire in you
and you need to let it out.

01:08:42.586 --> 01:08:43.718
What are you doing?

01:09:53.256 --> 01:09:54.756
Careful.

01:09:54.758 --> 01:09:56.257
I might miss.

01:10:57.654 --> 01:10:58.753
Night.

01:11:54.077 --> 01:11:55.410
It's me.

01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:32.447
Get up. Get the fuck up.

01:12:32.449 --> 01:12:33.981
Jesus! What, Brittany?

01:12:33.983 --> 01:12:36.617
Did you do something to her?
Did you do something to her?

01:12:36.619 --> 01:12:37.852
She got her monthly visit.

01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:39.620
I don't even know
if I can believe you.

01:12:39.622 --> 01:12:42.090
What, do you think
I fucking raped her?

01:12:42.092 --> 01:12:44.892
You are crazy. I don't
know what to believe.

01:12:44.894 --> 01:12:46.728
Hey. Watch yourself, Brittany.

01:12:46.730 --> 01:12:47.862
Call me that again.

01:12:49.099 --> 01:12:51.366
Calm down.

01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:53.634
Is this your master plan?
Is that what this shit is--
your plan?

01:12:53.636 --> 01:12:56.220
I needed to test her.

01:12:56.221 --> 01:12:58.805
Test her? You're not testing
her, you are torturing her.

01:12:58.808 --> 01:13:01.142
How's your plan coming
along, St. Brittany?

01:13:01.144 --> 01:13:03.778
Don't you dare put shit
on me. You did this.

01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:06.547
I'm sorry. Is that what you
actually think?

01:13:06.549 --> 01:13:07.982
It was your trap.

01:13:09.119 --> 01:13:10.885
I just covered your stupid ass.

01:13:10.887 --> 01:13:14.021
No, you were the one who
dragged her downstairs...

01:13:14.023 --> 01:13:16.124
We did, we dragged her.

01:13:16.126 --> 01:13:19.927
You're seriously going to try
that selective memory shit
this late in the game?

01:13:19.929 --> 01:13:24.432
I am trying to save us.
I'm trying to save her life.

01:13:24.434 --> 01:13:27.001
From what? It's just you.

01:13:27.003 --> 01:13:29.771
You have done nothing
but cover your own tracks,

01:13:29.773 --> 01:13:32.907
so if you're not going to help
me just let me fucking do it

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:35.710
because I can't fucking take
this. I can't take this.

01:13:35.712 --> 01:13:37.578
So, what? Am I
supposed to trust you?

01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:39.814
How am I supposed to trust you?

01:13:39.815 --> 01:13:42.049
How do I know you're not
going to go to the police and
just tell them everything?

01:13:42.051 --> 01:13:43.418
Why would I do that?

01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:45.686
Because you're a coward.

01:13:45.688 --> 01:13:48.689
Okay, Tori. So, what are
you going to do?

01:13:48.691 --> 01:13:52.093
Are you going to shoot me
in the fucking head?
Is that part of your plan too?

01:13:53.730 --> 01:13:55.496
Read it yourself, Brittany.

01:14:18.087 --> 01:14:19.821
You're fucking insane.

01:14:19.823 --> 01:14:21.522
Watch yourself, Brittany.

01:14:21.524 --> 01:14:23.708
Or what, Tori?

01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:25.893
-You're going to lose
your goddamn teeth.
-Excuse me?

01:14:25.895 --> 01:14:26.861
Wow.

01:14:27.964 --> 01:14:29.730
Big, brave girl.

01:14:31.534 --> 01:14:35.536
You are such a fucking cunt.

01:14:46.816 --> 01:14:47.882
[Erica, faintly] Britt.

01:14:50.019 --> 01:14:51.619
You have to do something.

01:14:53.623 --> 01:14:55.590
She's going to kill me.

01:14:56.259 --> 01:14:57.992
Then she's going to kill you.

01:15:00.630 --> 01:15:01.996
She's not right.

01:15:18.915 --> 01:15:22.550
[thumping]

01:16:37.894 --> 01:16:39.860
You just have to forget.

01:16:39.862 --> 01:16:41.028
What are you doing?

01:16:45.168 --> 01:16:48.836
[Erica moaning]
Stop! Please! This won't work.

01:17:20.937 --> 01:17:22.370
[Erica screaming]

01:17:26.976 --> 01:17:28.776
[Tori screaming in pain]

01:17:29.879 --> 01:17:31.312
Kill her, Britt!

01:17:43.059 --> 01:17:45.926
[Tori] Britt, what the fuck
are you doing?

01:17:45.928 --> 01:17:46.861
Ah!

01:17:50.033 --> 01:17:51.132
[moaning]

01:17:59.442 --> 01:18:02.443
I fucking want to.

01:18:03.346 --> 01:18:05.212
Ruin it for me.

01:18:05.214 --> 01:18:07.014
Come on, ruin it.

01:18:15.958 --> 01:18:18.793
He's coming back early
because of the storms.

01:18:25.435 --> 01:18:27.201
He'll be here in the morning.

01:18:28.137 --> 01:18:29.170
Britt.

01:18:32.275 --> 01:18:33.340
We have tonight.

01:18:34.177 --> 01:18:36.110
For all this we have tonight.

01:18:37.113 --> 01:18:38.345
Shit, right?

01:18:40.049 --> 01:18:41.949
Why does that change anything?

01:18:43.386 --> 01:18:45.052
What do you think
is going to happen?

01:18:46.723 --> 01:18:51.192
Explain it to everyone and then
they'll be cool with it?

01:18:51.194 --> 01:18:55.963
Or are you just going to try
to cover my blood and guts
in a night

01:18:56.799 --> 01:18:58.399
and hope that Erica
plays along?

01:18:59.368 --> 01:19:01.736
Because as far
as she's concerned,

01:19:03.005 --> 01:19:05.172
as far as anyone's concerned,

01:19:05.174 --> 01:19:07.174
she's innocent

01:19:07.176 --> 01:19:09.110
and somebody
has to take the blame.

01:19:12.448 --> 01:19:13.380
I get it.

01:19:14.417 --> 01:19:15.449
I'm crazy,

01:19:15.451 --> 01:19:20.921
but I have to be on your side
and you have to be on mine.

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:25.326
We both need the same thing.

01:19:29.098 --> 01:19:30.030
Britt.

01:19:38.975 --> 01:19:42.376
Fuck you. Fuck you both!

01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:22.977
[Tori] <i> What's the password?</i>

01:21:27.617 --> 01:21:28.549
Come on.

01:21:33.356 --> 01:21:34.455
What are you going to do?

01:21:36.225 --> 01:21:38.092
See if there's anything
to blackmail you with.

01:21:41.664 --> 01:21:43.230
8224.

01:21:56.545 --> 01:21:58.178
Do you have anything?

01:22:00.316 --> 01:22:01.482
No.

01:22:02.518 --> 01:22:03.450
Nothing?

01:22:22.338 --> 01:22:23.971
Were those from my mom?

01:22:27.443 --> 01:22:29.310
What did she say?

01:22:32.181 --> 01:22:34.348
Tell me what she said, please.

01:22:36.986 --> 01:22:39.286
Please tell me what she said.

01:22:40.423 --> 01:22:41.388
Please.

01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:43.390
-She loves you.
-So, help.

01:22:49.699 --> 01:22:52.132
This happens now, either way.

01:22:52.134 --> 01:22:54.201
Why?

01:22:54.202 --> 01:22:56.269
I want you to know what
we're fucking capable of.

01:22:56.272 --> 01:22:58.472
Are you still going to tell
people what happened here?

01:22:58.474 --> 01:23:00.007
I won't.

01:23:05.348 --> 01:23:06.613
That's what I was afraid of.

01:23:09.685 --> 01:23:11.251
Don't move.

01:23:13.356 --> 01:23:14.355
Relax.

01:23:16.258 --> 01:23:18.692
Just know
that I'm only going to hurt you
because I have to.

01:23:21.530 --> 01:23:23.764
And take this moment to think
about the process

01:23:23.766 --> 01:23:27.301
and how you can help
speed it along because
we're out of time.

01:23:29.271 --> 01:23:30.270
You ready?

01:23:34.677 --> 01:23:35.609
Good.

01:23:39.715 --> 01:23:43.684
Make me believe you.
I don't believe you.

01:23:45.621 --> 01:23:50.457
-I won't tell anyone.
-I don't fucking believe you.

01:23:50.459 --> 01:23:52.593
Don't make me do this.

01:23:55.197 --> 01:23:57.731
-I won't tell anyone, I swear!
-Bullshit!

01:23:57.733 --> 01:24:00.067
What do you want? I'll take
naked pictures.

01:24:00.069 --> 01:24:01.468
What, are we in sixth grade?

01:24:01.470 --> 01:24:03.470
No, no, no, I think
we're done with that

01:24:03.472 --> 01:24:05.773
so why don't you just make me
smell it on your breath?

01:24:05.775 --> 01:24:08.375
Do you know what will happen
if you tell anyone?

01:24:08.377 --> 01:24:09.710
Are you going to tell anyone?

01:24:09.712 --> 01:24:12.312
No. I fucking swear!

01:24:12.314 --> 01:24:13.380
Fuck that.

01:24:35.438 --> 01:24:36.703
You watch the news?

01:24:37.673 --> 01:24:39.773
You should.
It's got some interesting stuff.

01:24:41.310 --> 01:24:42.509
Pour it.

01:24:55.091 --> 01:24:56.590
Are you going to tell anyone?

01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:05.365
Just say the safe word.

01:25:12.441 --> 01:25:15.843
Are you going to tell anyone?

01:25:15.845 --> 01:25:17.578
I won't. I won't.

01:25:18.881 --> 01:25:20.180
[Tori] Fill it back up.

01:25:26.722 --> 01:25:28.722
Relax. Relax.

01:25:29.892 --> 01:25:31.525
Breathe.

01:25:31.527 --> 01:25:32.626
Breathe.

01:25:47.409 --> 01:25:48.542
Your turn.

01:26:01.924 --> 01:26:03.223
Harder.

01:26:08.564 --> 01:26:10.164
[Erica] I don't care anymore.

01:26:11.834 --> 01:26:12.799
Do it.

01:26:33.756 --> 01:26:35.822
[Tori]
Are you going to tell anyone?

01:26:36.825 --> 01:26:38.492
Are you going to tell anyone?

01:26:39.628 --> 01:26:44.198
Yes. I'll tell everyone.
I'll tell everyone.

01:26:45.334 --> 01:26:46.466
[Tori] I don't believe you.

01:27:15.264 --> 01:27:17.231
How many shots
do you think that was?

01:27:18.968 --> 01:27:20.400
You haven't eaten in a while.

01:27:20.402 --> 01:27:22.236
A few more, you'll be drunk.

01:27:22.238 --> 01:27:24.622
A few more, you pass out.

01:27:24.623 --> 01:27:27.007
Then after that, you're just
a cautionary tale for people
on prom night.

01:27:27.009 --> 01:27:29.243
I'm done fucking with you.

01:27:29.878 --> 01:27:32.479
Shut the fuck up.

01:27:33.849 --> 01:27:34.948
It's over.

01:27:36.385 --> 01:27:37.584
It's fucking over.

01:27:37.586 --> 01:27:41.788
You're just getting off on this
shit so just do it already.

01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:45.292
I don't even care. Just do it.

01:27:56.739 --> 01:28:00.007
I want you to live,
even if you don't.

01:28:02.678 --> 01:28:04.044
I don't believe you.

01:28:05.381 --> 01:28:06.947
Maybe another drink would help.

01:28:16.759 --> 01:28:20.060
You know, you've got an awful
lot of vodka on you.

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:26.400
It'd be a shame if someone...

01:28:26.401 --> 01:28:28.001
[voice from fire alarm]
<i> Fire. Please vacate</i>
<i> the premises. Fire.</i>

01:28:28.904 --> 01:28:32.973
-<i> Fire. Please, vacate</i>
<i> the premises. Fire.</i>
-Get the alarm.

01:28:32.975 --> 01:28:36.376

<i> Fire. Please, vacate</i>

01:28:40.749 --> 01:28:44.318
<i> Fire. Please, vacate</i>

01:28:45.421 --> 01:28:47.654
-Fuck.
-<i> Fire. Please, vacate</i>
<i> the premises. Fire.</i>

01:28:47.656 --> 01:28:49.523
Cancel. Cancel.

01:28:49.525 --> 01:28:51.825
<i> Fire. Please, vacate</i>
<i> the premises. Fire.</i>

01:29:00.369 --> 01:29:01.468
Are they coming?

01:29:03.072 --> 01:29:04.004
I don't know.

01:29:05.841 --> 01:29:07.808
Get the keys to the boat.
Bring the vodka.

01:29:58.160 --> 01:29:59.092
The gun.

01:30:10.572 --> 01:30:12.105
[man] You smell that?

01:30:12.107 --> 01:30:14.441
[man] It's like
something's burning.

01:30:14.443 --> 01:30:16.476
[man] Shouldn't we be kind
of concerned about that?

01:30:18.147 --> 01:30:19.546
[man] What in the hell?

01:30:41.637 --> 01:30:42.569
What?

01:30:46.842 --> 01:30:48.192
What do we do?

01:30:48.193 --> 01:30:49.543
Is there anyone else
in the house?

01:30:49.545 --> 01:30:50.510
You just missed them.

01:30:50.512 --> 01:30:51.912
Calvin, she saw our faces.

01:30:51.914 --> 01:30:55.849
I know! Go start on the safe.

01:30:55.851 --> 01:30:57.451
-Jesus Christ!
-Hey.

01:31:04.726 --> 01:31:06.193
What happened
to you, sweetheart?

01:31:24.012 --> 01:31:27.080
You're not going to call
the cops, are you?

01:31:30.486 --> 01:31:31.518
No.

01:31:33.188 --> 01:31:36.590
I thought the place
was empty. No car.

01:31:38.126 --> 01:31:39.159
<i> No lights.</i>

01:31:40.262 --> 01:31:41.728
Who did this?

01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:46.800
-Where's Tori and her friend?
-Just shoot me.

01:31:52.808 --> 01:31:54.174
What happened to you?

01:31:56.945 --> 01:31:58.111
Just shoot me.

01:32:19.101 --> 01:32:20.634
What's your name?

01:32:22.304 --> 01:32:23.670
How old are you?

01:32:35.551 --> 01:32:38.051
-When God spoke to Abraham...
-Don't make a fucking speech.

01:32:39.087 --> 01:32:41.721
Just shoot me.

01:32:44.259 --> 01:32:45.559
I'm tired.

01:32:48.730 --> 01:32:53.266
I'm tired
and so if you're going to do it,

01:32:54.570 --> 01:32:56.803
please just shoot me.

01:32:58.106 --> 01:32:59.873
-Sweetheart...
-Please.

01:33:02.110 --> 01:33:03.143
Come on.

01:33:04.279 --> 01:33:07.314
Come on,
you coward. Come on.

01:33:10.319 --> 01:33:11.851
Shoot me!

01:33:15.257 --> 01:33:16.690
I'm right here.

01:33:17.693 --> 01:33:18.825
I'm right here!

01:33:20.662 --> 01:33:21.928
I'm right here.

01:34:14.783 --> 01:34:17.117
It's okay. It's okay.

01:34:23.659 --> 01:34:24.858
You're okay.

01:34:25.927 --> 01:34:27.861
Nobody's going
to hurt you, okay?

01:34:29.731 --> 01:34:30.897
You're okay.

01:34:32.167 --> 01:34:33.667
You're okay, darling.

01:34:43.412 --> 01:34:44.778
[firing a shot]

01:35:42.204 --> 01:35:43.203
Thank you.

01:36:14.369 --> 01:36:18.972
[Tori on the phone]
<i> Hello? We need police</i>
<i> or an ambulance.</i>

01:36:21.476 --> 01:36:25.411
<i> Two men broke</i>
<i>into the house we're staying in</i>
<i> and attacked us.</i>

01:36:33.522 --> 01:36:36.189
<i> No. We were able</i>

01:36:41.797 --> 01:36:45.198
<i> I think they're dead,</i>
<i> but please send help quick.</i>

01:36:47.135 --> 01:36:49.569
<i> Thank you. I'm really scared.</i>

01:37:42.357 --> 01:37:43.857
[Erica] <i> Yeah, everything's fine.</i>

01:37:47.095 --> 01:37:49.195
I promise. Just tired.

01:37:51.399 --> 01:37:52.332
Yeah.

01:37:55.036 --> 01:37:57.337
Hey, I have to go.
It's starting.

01:38:00.876 --> 01:38:01.608
Okay.

01:38:04.379 --> 01:38:05.445
I love you too.

01:38:08.183 --> 01:38:09.115
Bye.

01:39:40.108 --> 01:39:42.275
