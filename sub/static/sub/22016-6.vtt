WEBVTT

00:01.683 --> 00:03.935
Behold
the Quantum Flux --

00:03.985 --> 00:05.653
a magic portal to the past,

00:05.738 --> 00:08.507
what some might call
a "time machine."

00:08.574 --> 00:10.575
This is where you guys go
"Oooh."

00:10.642 --> 00:11.543
No, thank you.
Just get on with it.

00:11.610 --> 00:13.027
"Ooh," indeed.

00:13.095 --> 00:15.163
I'm throwing Dad and Gloria's
10th anniversary party,

00:15.214 --> 00:16.614
and Phil is part
of the entertainment.

00:16.682 --> 00:18.699
I'm gonna make Gloria
seemingly dematerialize,

00:18.751 --> 00:20.702
then wondrously travel
back through time,

00:20.769 --> 00:23.138
and then rematerialize
in her wedding dress.

00:23.205 --> 00:24.489
She's gonna change her clothes
in a box.

00:24.557 --> 00:26.040
This is why I'm nervous
about you introducing me.

00:26.108 --> 00:28.593
I'm kidding!
You're gonna be great.

00:28.661 --> 00:29.744
He <i> better</i> be great.

00:29.811 --> 00:32.479
I want Dad and Gloria's party
to be perfect.

00:32.515 --> 00:34.516
I was kind of a pill
at their wedding.

00:34.583 --> 00:36.568
I hadn't
fully accepted Gloria yet.

00:36.636 --> 00:39.487
And I feel a little
responsible for what
happened with my mom.

00:39.572 --> 00:42.040
I fed her, like, three drinks
at the reception.

00:42.108 --> 00:43.674
You know,
just to take the edge off.

00:43.742 --> 00:46.127
I'm Gloria!
Kiss me!
Oh, hey, kiss me!

00:47.446 --> 00:49.280
No, no! Oh, geez!

00:49.282 --> 00:50.231
Mom! Mom!

00:50.299 --> 00:52.200
She almost took
the doorframe off.

00:52.268 --> 00:54.685
Into the wormhole she goes.
Ow.

00:54.753 --> 00:56.087
Clocks turn backwards,

00:56.155 --> 00:58.656
calendar pages
re-attach themselves...
Hey!

00:58.724 --> 01:00.141
...and behold!

01:00.208 --> 01:03.445
The beautiful bride!

01:03.512 --> 01:05.597
Guys! This isn't exciting
to you?

01:05.765 --> 01:06.998
Use your imaginations.

01:07.066 --> 01:09.216
Picture me standing
next to Gloria

01:09.301 --> 01:10.351
in a wedding dress.

01:10.436 --> 01:12.136
We're done.

01:13.305 --> 01:14.956
Mitchell,
did you get the cake?

01:15.023 --> 01:16.374
Yeah, yeah.
I got everything.

01:16.441 --> 01:17.742
Okay, good.
I'll have to meet you
at Dad's.

01:17.809 --> 01:20.094
I need to go with Phil
to pick up his magic box.

01:20.162 --> 01:21.179
Oh, and, hey,
you told Phil

01:21.247 --> 01:23.264
not to mention the trick
to Cam, right?

01:23.332 --> 01:24.782
If Cam finds out,
he's just gonna want us

01:24.850 --> 01:26.350
to do some kind
of performance, too.

01:26.418 --> 01:28.302
Pretty sure I told him
not to say anything.

01:32.158 --> 01:33.725
Yeah, pretty sure
you didn't.

01:46.105 --> 01:47.655
So, uh, what's all this?

01:47.723 --> 01:49.207
This is redemption.

01:49.275 --> 01:50.892
Maybe just
a straight answer.

01:50.960 --> 01:52.910
The year was 2007 --

01:52.978 --> 01:55.413
the wedding reception
of Jay and Gloria.
Oh.

01:55.481 --> 01:58.433
Our gift to the newlyweds
was a duet performance

01:58.518 --> 02:00.217
of "Islands in the Stream."
"Islands in the Stream."

02:00.269 --> 02:01.936
A gift that would never be,
because...

02:02.004 --> 02:03.087
I remember.

02:03.155 --> 02:05.440
I fed my mom a few drinks
at the reception.

02:05.507 --> 02:07.875
I really did not want to sing,
so I figured

02:07.943 --> 02:10.527
if I got her a little tipsy,
I wouldn't have to perform

02:10.596 --> 02:12.080
because I'd have to
hold her hand...

02:12.148 --> 02:14.198
No, no, no!
Oh, geez!

02:14.266 --> 02:15.666
Mom, Mom!

02:15.734 --> 02:17.885
...and later
hold her hair back.

02:17.953 --> 02:20.354
Well, your family has wondered
for 10 years "What if?"

02:20.422 --> 02:22.890
Today,
they find out what for.

02:22.958 --> 02:24.242
Mm, I don't know, Cam.

02:24.293 --> 02:25.477
I'm a little rusty,

02:25.544 --> 02:28.012
and acoustics are never good
inside a tent.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.931
And -- Oh!
This party isn't about us.

02:29.999 --> 02:31.549
There's a whole slate
of performers.

02:31.617 --> 02:33.134
Gloria's changing
in a box.

02:33.201 --> 02:34.685
Which makes our medley
all the more welcome.

02:34.753 --> 02:36.805
It's a medley now?
No! No.

02:36.872 --> 02:38.523
In no way, shape, or form

02:38.591 --> 02:40.992
am I performing today in front
o my judgmental family.

02:41.059 --> 02:43.445
Fine. We'll just...
go to the party.

02:43.512 --> 02:44.612
Thank you.

02:44.680 --> 02:46.113
No medley.
Exactly.

02:46.181 --> 02:47.732
Wait.
This isn't a trick --

02:47.799 --> 02:49.400
Just three
un-related songs.

02:49.468 --> 02:51.219
You just agreed.
Rehearsal starts right now.

02:51.287 --> 02:53.120
Jump in
when you're ready.

02:57.927 --> 02:59.510
Why are <i> you</i> cooking?

02:59.578 --> 03:01.179
Are you allowed
back there?

03:01.246 --> 03:03.781
It's our anniversary.
Can't I do something nice
for your mother?

03:03.849 --> 03:05.499
Maybe.

03:05.584 --> 03:06.951
Morning, beautiful.

03:07.019 --> 03:08.920
We have huevos,
we have chorizo,
we have tortilla.

03:08.987 --> 03:10.671
What we <i> ain't</i> got
is Manny.

03:10.706 --> 03:13.825
Unfortunately, he's gonna be
a no-show at the party today.

03:13.876 --> 03:15.143
Aha.

03:15.211 --> 03:16.410
What can I get you?

03:16.478 --> 03:18.162
Take that garbage away
from me.

03:18.230 --> 03:20.097
I'm going for a walk.

03:21.267 --> 03:23.034
Manny was a big part
of our wedding.

03:23.102 --> 03:25.670
He walked Gloria
down the aisle,
did the calligraphy.

03:25.737 --> 03:28.372
And I knew him not showing up
to our anniversary party

03:28.440 --> 03:30.542
would put Gloria
in a bad mood.

03:30.610 --> 03:32.426
In some ways,
I feel responsible.

03:36.265 --> 03:37.915
You're home again?

03:37.983 --> 03:39.050
You're in college.

03:39.118 --> 03:41.035
You can't come back
every weekend!

03:41.037 --> 03:42.437
So no hug?
I love you,

03:42.439 --> 03:44.289
but you're not making the most
of your college experience

03:44.356 --> 03:45.539
by being here
all the time.

03:45.607 --> 03:47.825
My father dropped me off
my freshman year,

03:47.960 --> 03:49.494
and I didn't see him again
till the spring.

03:49.561 --> 03:51.095
You want to know why?
I don't know.

03:51.163 --> 03:52.163
Something about dames
and fistfights?

03:52.214 --> 03:54.215
Exactly --
too busy making friends,

03:54.282 --> 03:56.300
chasing skirts,
and things of that nature.

03:56.352 --> 03:58.135
But your mother and I think
it's bad for you

03:58.203 --> 03:59.421
to be here all the time.

03:59.488 --> 04:00.338
So hit the road,

04:00.405 --> 04:02.107
and we'll see you
at Thanksgiving.

04:02.174 --> 04:03.524
Wait.
I'm banned from my house?

04:03.526 --> 04:05.226
Don't think of it
that way.

04:05.294 --> 04:07.044
You're banned
from <i> my</i> house.

04:09.515 --> 04:12.483
Technically, Gloria
was not in on this decision,

04:12.551 --> 04:14.102
in the sense that...

04:14.170 --> 04:17.004
she was not
in on this decision.

04:17.072 --> 04:18.990
Ruff, ruff, ruff!

04:20.142 --> 04:21.909
I was a little grumpy.

04:21.976 --> 04:23.961
I had agreed
to do this magic trick

04:24.029 --> 04:25.613
at the party with Phil.

04:25.680 --> 04:26.998
I go into a box,

04:27.065 --> 04:29.634
and then I come out
in my wedding dress.

04:29.702 --> 04:30.968
But there was a problem.

04:31.036 --> 04:32.086
Pull!

04:32.221 --> 04:33.371
She won't budge!

04:34.540 --> 04:35.974
The only logical explanation

04:36.042 --> 04:38.342
is that somebody
snuck into my closet

04:38.410 --> 04:40.345
and shrunk my wedding dress.

04:40.412 --> 04:42.530
Like, probably my sister.

04:42.598 --> 04:43.731
So for the past week,

04:43.798 --> 04:45.766
I've had to, like,
get even skinnier

04:45.834 --> 04:48.169
than I was at my wedding.

04:48.237 --> 04:50.021
Oh, shut up.

04:53.808 --> 04:54.993
Be cool.

04:55.060 --> 04:56.143
Phil,
it's a magic shop.

04:56.211 --> 04:58.163
I'm the coolest person
that's ever been in here.

05:01.417 --> 05:03.884
Oh!

05:03.952 --> 05:05.470
How does he do it?

05:05.537 --> 05:07.204
I'm kidding.
I know how he does it.

05:07.272 --> 05:09.390
Claire, meet the legendary
Mister Ekshun.

05:09.458 --> 05:10.642
Hello.

05:10.793 --> 05:12.493
And what's this
behind your ear?

05:12.561 --> 05:14.595
Oh,
just some sweater fluff.

05:14.663 --> 05:16.097
Well,
the place looks great.

05:16.165 --> 05:17.681
Can you imagine
coming here every day?

05:17.749 --> 05:19.667
I <i> wish</i>
it was every day.

05:19.735 --> 05:22.553
I have less and less time
for the old Illusionatorium,

05:22.621 --> 05:24.522
with all the road jobs
I still book.

05:24.589 --> 05:26.140
Would you mind quickly
walking me through

05:26.208 --> 05:28.259
the Quantum Flux Illusion?
Uh-huh.

05:28.327 --> 05:30.544
Well,
according to magic bylaws,

05:30.612 --> 05:32.463
I can't disclose
the secret

05:32.531 --> 05:35.866
in the presence
of a non-licensed magician.

05:35.934 --> 05:37.986
Not a problem.
I can just step outside.

05:38.053 --> 05:38.953
Nonsense!

05:39.021 --> 05:41.706
We prepare
for such things.

05:41.774 --> 05:45.343
Ah! The old
sensory-deprivation helmet.

05:45.410 --> 05:46.377
Oh!
I put that baby on,

05:46.445 --> 05:48.480
it's almost like
I don't have roommates.

05:48.547 --> 05:50.481
Yeah, I, like I said,
could just step out--

05:50.549 --> 05:51.749
Outside would be fine.

05:53.152 --> 05:54.519
She's lovely.

05:54.586 --> 05:56.287
Yeah.
I'm super lucky.

05:56.355 --> 05:59.540
Thank you so much
for helping me with this.

05:59.608 --> 06:00.457
Are you kidding?

06:00.626 --> 06:02.060
I wouldn't have this life

06:02.128 --> 06:03.711
if you hadn't turned down
the magician gig

06:03.778 --> 06:05.713
on that Ixtapa cruise
years ago.

06:05.781 --> 06:07.832
What? I-I was
never offered that job.

06:07.899 --> 06:10.501
Yeah, they said
they called you
and never heard back,

06:10.569 --> 06:12.403
so they moved on to <i> me.</i>

06:12.471 --> 06:14.555
I never got that call!

06:14.623 --> 06:15.890
Oh!

06:15.958 --> 06:17.942
I couldn't breathe!
I couldn't breathe!

06:17.944 --> 06:20.227
Well, you forgot
to turn on the ventilator.

06:20.295 --> 06:21.763
That was
supposed to be <i> my</i> job?

06:21.830 --> 06:23.164
No.

06:23.231 --> 06:26.183
This was supposed to be
<i>my</i> job.

06:26.251 --> 06:27.852
I look stupid.

06:27.919 --> 06:29.370
Hey, you see what a bad mood
your mother's in?

06:29.488 --> 06:30.788
That's because
she misses Manny.

06:30.856 --> 06:31.890
Today, you're Manny.

06:31.957 --> 06:33.607
But wouldn't she miss Joe
then?

06:33.675 --> 06:34.709
Don't overthink.

06:34.776 --> 06:36.761
Just go in there,
act all heartsick,

06:36.829 --> 06:38.797
and tell her
you want to have high tea.

06:40.682 --> 06:43.901
Hey, Mom.
Why are girls such a mystery?

06:43.969 --> 06:45.386
Have a scone!

06:45.454 --> 06:47.988
Get out of here.
I cannot even look at that.

06:50.476 --> 06:51.492
Yikes!

06:51.560 --> 06:53.144
Shake it off.
That's okay.

06:53.211 --> 06:55.863
That's a good first try.
Go grab his pan flute!

06:57.850 --> 06:59.617
How's my bride?

06:59.684 --> 07:01.836
Ay! So big now.

07:01.904 --> 07:03.655
I know.
It snuck up on me, too.

07:03.722 --> 07:06.307
But remember, letting go
is a natural part of life.

07:06.374 --> 07:08.809
No.
It's terrible, Jay.

07:08.877 --> 07:12.212
And sending Joe in here
with scones made it worse!

07:14.199 --> 07:17.518
<i>Silencio,</i> Fulgencio!

07:17.586 --> 07:22.390
♪ That old black magic
has me in its spell ♪

07:22.457 --> 07:26.260
♪ That old black magic
that you weave so well ♪

07:26.395 --> 07:27.645
Take it, Daddy!

07:31.166 --> 07:32.266
Oh!
Hi, Mitchell.

07:32.334 --> 07:34.084
You know what?
I def traded up with Lily.

07:34.152 --> 07:35.769
I'm glad you backed out.

07:35.854 --> 07:37.838
Lily, why don't you
go rest your instrument?

07:37.906 --> 07:41.242
So, uh, just to break down
this "foolproof" plan,

07:41.310 --> 07:42.944
you thought
this would make me so jealous

07:43.012 --> 07:45.062
that I'd beg to be back
in the act, didn't you?

07:45.130 --> 07:47.982
Um, no. I just found
a younger talent
that I clicked with.

07:48.050 --> 07:51.319
Okay, well, I look forward
to watching you two perform.

07:51.387 --> 07:55.390
Well, I envy you
getting to <i> watch</i> us perform.

07:55.457 --> 07:57.241
Lily, sweetheart,
get in here!

07:57.308 --> 07:58.709
The rehearsal's not over!

07:58.777 --> 08:01.829
Y-Y-Yeah, time's a-wasting,
my little thrush!

08:01.897 --> 08:03.831
And hurry!
The party starts real soon!

08:03.899 --> 08:05.750
Okay, you know what?
You win.

08:05.817 --> 08:08.286
You know I'm never
taking the stage
with that screech owl.

08:08.353 --> 08:09.904
Just sing.

08:09.971 --> 08:11.538
It would be very important
for you.

08:11.606 --> 08:13.124
For <i> me?</i>
Yes.

08:13.191 --> 08:17.428
Your family has been entranced
by my performances many times.

08:17.496 --> 08:19.647
I don't need this,
but over the last 10 years,

08:19.715 --> 08:22.733
I've watch you shrink
in their presence.

08:22.801 --> 08:24.368
And you love to sing.

08:24.436 --> 08:25.769
I like it fine.

08:25.837 --> 08:27.638
And when we go out,
you're the first person

08:27.706 --> 08:29.941
to grab the karaoke mic
and scat the night away,

08:30.008 --> 08:31.209
and you're good at it.

08:31.276 --> 08:33.594
You know what people
are calling you?
No.

08:33.662 --> 08:34.929
"Fella Fitzgerald."

08:34.996 --> 08:36.179
They do not!

08:36.248 --> 08:37.932
Yes, they do.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.384
And just once, I would love
to watch your talent soar

08:40.452 --> 08:43.270
in front of your family
and shut them up for good.

08:43.337 --> 08:44.889
But if you don't
want to --
You know what? Screw it.

08:44.957 --> 08:47.424
I don't even care that
I'm mostly sure you're
manipulating me right now.

08:47.492 --> 08:48.943
We're doing this.

08:49.011 --> 08:50.511
I knew you'd come around.
Welcome back to the act.

08:50.796 --> 08:52.679
Okay, now, this is
a bit much for me.

08:52.747 --> 08:54.632
So...

08:58.303 --> 09:01.221
Hey, Beardy.
Have you seen Manny Delgado?

09:01.273 --> 09:03.324
I think the make-out king
is a little occupied.

09:09.264 --> 09:11.799
Have you no respect
for the ascot?!

09:12.734 --> 09:14.335
What are you doing here?

09:14.402 --> 09:16.320
I need you to come
to our anniversary party.

09:16.388 --> 09:17.705
I thought I was
persona non grata.

09:17.772 --> 09:20.074
Now I'm halfway
into flagrante delicto.

09:20.142 --> 09:21.109
This, I don't miss.

09:21.176 --> 09:23.694
Your mother is upset
you're not gonna be there.

09:23.762 --> 09:25.597
Well, then maybe she shouldn't
have banished me
from the house.

09:25.664 --> 09:27.781
I may have accidently
led you to believe

09:27.849 --> 09:29.700
that she was part
of that decision,

09:29.768 --> 09:31.352
when actually --
I knew it!

09:31.420 --> 09:33.771
I knew my mom wouldn't be
that mean to her little papi.

09:33.839 --> 09:34.906
Manny?

09:34.973 --> 09:36.424
One minute, baby.

09:36.492 --> 09:38.308
- That's been working?
- Shut up.

09:38.477 --> 09:41.011
So, I've been icing my mother
for a week because of <i> you?</i>

09:41.079 --> 09:42.547
She must think
I'm the worst son.

09:42.614 --> 09:44.181
Then come home
and make her day.

09:44.249 --> 09:46.984
I'm not dropping everything
to come home and bail you out.

09:47.052 --> 09:49.070
Tomorrow, maybe --
and I'm telling her

09:49.138 --> 09:50.488
you're the reason
I haven't been around.
Hold on. Hold on.

09:50.556 --> 09:52.456
It's better
if she hears it from <i> me.</i>

09:52.524 --> 09:53.858
I just have to spin it

09:53.925 --> 09:56.193
as if it's something
I did in your best interest.

09:56.261 --> 09:57.145
And I'm supposed
to back that up

09:57.212 --> 09:58.796
like I'm somehow better off
because --

09:58.863 --> 10:00.331
Where'd you go,
baby bear?

10:00.398 --> 10:01.582
Coming, baby bear.

10:01.650 --> 10:02.816
You're welcome.

10:02.884 --> 10:04.318
But two baby bears?

10:04.386 --> 10:06.253
I'm new at this.

10:06.321 --> 10:08.822
Hey, Claire.
Quick question.
Uh-huh.

10:08.890 --> 10:11.492
I see that you only have
Mitch and I down for one song.

10:11.560 --> 10:13.694
Mm-hmm.
Which isn't enough time
to tell a story.

10:13.762 --> 10:16.714
So we would be willing to cut
our set list to six songs.

10:16.782 --> 10:17.631
Cool.
So we'll keep it at one?

10:17.699 --> 10:19.200
Okay,
so five quick songs, then?

10:19.267 --> 10:20.267
<i>One</i> song.
Okay, I would be willing

10:20.335 --> 10:22.469
to close this right now
at three songs.

10:22.537 --> 10:24.004
One <i> quick</i> song,
and if you so much

10:24.072 --> 10:26.540
as begin
to introduce the band,
I'll cut the power off.

10:26.608 --> 10:29.593
Okay, that is not the way
you talk to talent.

10:29.661 --> 10:31.596
Gloria?

10:31.613 --> 10:34.281
I'm in the bathroom!
Come in!

10:34.349 --> 10:36.483
Oh, uh...

10:36.551 --> 10:38.168
i-it's Phil.

10:38.236 --> 10:39.920
Come in!

10:39.988 --> 10:41.221
Phil Dunphy.

10:41.289 --> 10:42.557
Phil!

10:44.042 --> 10:46.059
Hey.

10:46.127 --> 10:47.945
The dress
is in that bag over there.

10:48.012 --> 10:50.531
Oh, great. I'll hide it
in the back
of the time machine.

10:50.599 --> 10:52.183
You, uh...

10:52.251 --> 10:54.384
You got a big wrestling match
coming up?

10:54.452 --> 10:56.069
I am having a bad day.

10:56.137 --> 10:57.905
I don't feel like doing
the chitchatting.

10:57.972 --> 10:59.473
Not having a great day
myself.

10:59.541 --> 11:00.958
Missed a phone call
15 years ago

11:01.026 --> 11:03.427
that could have launched
a second career as a magician.

11:03.478 --> 11:05.012
I could've had it all.

11:05.080 --> 11:07.181
Realtor by day,
magician by night.

11:07.249 --> 11:09.634
Just like the hero
of that rock opera
I never finished.

11:09.701 --> 11:11.735
Phil, this feels like
the chitchatting.

11:11.803 --> 11:13.720
Well, I should probably
get going.

11:13.788 --> 11:15.589
The steam's starting
to pucker up my suit.

11:15.657 --> 11:18.058
Whew! Done.

11:18.126 --> 11:19.660
It's the same suit
I wore to your wedding.

11:20.879 --> 11:22.379
Can't believe
how loose it's gotten.

11:25.517 --> 11:26.900
And now it is my pleasure

11:26.968 --> 11:30.004
to bring up the first of
our very special entertainers.

11:30.072 --> 11:32.807
Here to perform <i> one</i> song,

11:32.874 --> 11:34.192
Cameron and Mitchell.

11:35.827 --> 11:36.844
Just relax.

11:40.315 --> 11:42.032
Okay, now, remember --
it's just like karaoke.

11:42.100 --> 11:43.367
Yeah, yeah, I-I got it.
I got it.

11:43.435 --> 11:45.369
Sing a little and then
throw to the drum solo.

11:45.436 --> 11:47.388

12:23.308 --> 12:25.559
Now he's a strong,
capable man

12:25.627 --> 12:28.345
making nonsense noises that
sound a lot like instruments.

Hey!

13:05.700 --> 13:08.219
Thank you!
Thank you so much!

13:08.287 --> 13:09.436
One more ti--

13:09.504 --> 13:12.022
Okay. Nope.

13:18.647 --> 13:19.863
Thank you very much.

13:19.998 --> 13:21.749
Uh, muy kind, pero
I know you're only doing it

13:21.816 --> 13:23.450
to make me feel
mas better.

13:23.518 --> 13:26.119
Wow. Somebody's been listening
to Rosetta Stone in the car.

13:26.187 --> 13:29.023
Cam, come on.
Talk to me.

13:29.090 --> 13:31.709
What in the skibbity doo wop
was that?

13:33.462 --> 13:34.946
Did you bring
your own studio audience?

13:35.013 --> 13:36.180
No.
They're Gloria's family.

13:36.248 --> 13:38.399
Unlike some people,
they feel things.

13:38.467 --> 13:40.751
Cam, look, I'm sorry.
I got carried away.

13:40.818 --> 13:42.186
It seemed
deliberately hurtful.

13:42.253 --> 13:43.537
Every musician got a solo

13:43.604 --> 13:45.523
except the one you promised
to have and to hold.

13:45.840 --> 13:47.508
Aww!
Okay, do you mind?

13:47.576 --> 13:48.809
Thank you.

13:48.894 --> 13:51.044
Look, Cam, I-I'm sorry
I forgot to throw it to you,

13:51.112 --> 13:53.430
but I-I was just
swept up in the moment.

13:53.565 --> 13:55.316
It -- That was --
It was exhilarating.

13:55.384 --> 13:58.285
I-I -- Did you hear
those people cheering?

13:58.353 --> 14:00.988
Well...
you <i> were</i> brilliant.

14:01.055 --> 14:02.973
Not the most generous
of performances, but --

14:03.041 --> 14:06.244
I was completely free in front
of my entire judgy family,

14:06.311 --> 14:09.280
and none of that would have
happened without you.

14:09.347 --> 14:10.747
Well, I think I hear
what you're saying --

14:10.799 --> 14:13.300
that half of that applause
was mine

14:13.385 --> 14:15.119
'cause I transformed you.
Okay.

14:15.187 --> 14:17.304
Well, that's better
than any 10-minute drum solo.

14:17.372 --> 14:18.806
So you'll tell everyone
this was my doing?

14:18.874 --> 14:21.041
Of course I wil.
Come here.

14:21.109 --> 14:21.609
Ooh!

14:25.614 --> 14:28.248
Okay, I'll spin the box
two times,

14:28.316 --> 14:30.818
you'll have 30 seconds
to change
into your wedding dress.

14:30.886 --> 14:33.787
Or I change
into an old pair of pajamas

14:33.855 --> 14:35.472
to show the people
how comfortable

14:35.540 --> 14:36.974
I have always been
with Jay.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.158
Oh, yeah.
Sure, Gloria.

14:38.226 --> 14:39.226
Why don't we just
throw the script out

14:39.294 --> 14:40.328
and you can say
whatever you want,

14:40.395 --> 14:41.445
'cause the audience
already thinks

14:41.496 --> 14:43.547
the actors make it all up
anyway?!

14:43.615 --> 14:44.915
I'm sorry!

14:44.983 --> 14:45.816
What's going on?

14:45.884 --> 14:47.418
It's okay, Phil.

14:47.486 --> 14:49.586
He's very upset
because 15 years ago,

14:49.654 --> 14:53.441
he missed a phone call
for a job to do boat magic.

14:53.508 --> 14:55.642
That's why you've been sulking
all afternoon?

14:55.710 --> 14:57.278
My life would be
completely different

14:57.345 --> 14:58.979
if not for stupid fate!

14:59.047 --> 15:00.031
Fate?

15:00.098 --> 15:01.098
Let me ask you
something.

15:01.165 --> 15:03.784
And there's
a real lesson here.

15:03.852 --> 15:06.904
Do you like
how your life turned out?
Yeah, sure.

15:06.971 --> 15:09.840
Great family, steady work,
bus benches?

15:09.908 --> 15:11.509
I got that call
when you weren't home

15:11.576 --> 15:13.276
and never gave you
the message.

15:13.344 --> 15:16.063
What -- question mark,
exclamation point?!

15:16.131 --> 15:17.782
Why would you do something
like that?!

15:17.849 --> 15:19.616
To save him
from himself.

15:19.684 --> 15:21.752
People sometimes need
a gentle nudge

15:21.820 --> 15:23.320
to make the right choice.

15:23.388 --> 15:24.905
And, luckily for everyone,
I'm here to do it.

15:24.973 --> 15:26.490
And not just for Phil.

15:26.557 --> 15:28.592
I know you're wondering
why Manny isn't here.

15:28.660 --> 15:30.660
I b--
Who's ready
for some magic?

15:30.728 --> 15:32.212
Phil, Gloria, you're up.

15:35.567 --> 15:36.884
Honey, you okay?
Nope!

15:36.952 --> 15:39.086
Ladies and gentlemen,

15:39.153 --> 15:40.954
the scientists
would have you believe

15:41.022 --> 15:42.923
that time travel
is poppycock.

15:43.058 --> 15:46.427
But today, on the anniversary
of the wonderful Gloria

15:46.494 --> 15:47.845
and <i> Jay,</i>

15:47.912 --> 15:50.080
I shall confound
the skeptics

15:50.148 --> 15:52.482
and transport
this beautiful woman

15:52.550 --> 15:55.185
back in time
to the day of her wedding.

15:55.237 --> 15:58.138
Gloria, get in the box!

15:59.057 --> 16:01.675
Drumroll, please.

16:24.266 --> 16:26.917
Whoo!
Yes, drums!

16:26.985 --> 16:28.953
Yes!

16:29.020 --> 16:32.305
Anyway, watch
as she disappears
into the wormhole.

16:32.373 --> 16:33.791
That's my trick.
I'm done.

16:33.858 --> 16:36.377
What do you mean, you're done?
Bring her back.

16:36.444 --> 16:38.011
Okay, I'm ready!

16:38.079 --> 16:39.996
You made <i> my</i> dream
disappear.

16:40.064 --> 16:41.999
Now <i> yours</i> is gone.

16:42.066 --> 16:44.184
iHola!
I want to come out!

16:44.235 --> 16:47.004
Phil. Phil, you are
Dede-ing my party.

16:47.072 --> 16:48.688
Your father Dede'd
my <i> life.</i>

16:48.756 --> 16:50.991
He's the one who got
the phone call 15 years ago

16:51.059 --> 16:53.093
about the magic job
and never told me.

16:53.161 --> 16:53.977
Oh, Phil.

16:54.045 --> 16:56.563
Your family has always
treated me like a child

16:56.565 --> 16:57.764
who can't make
his own decisions.

16:57.832 --> 16:59.717
I couldn't even make
an outfit choice
for the wedding

16:59.784 --> 17:01.501
without your mother
commenting on it.

17:01.619 --> 17:03.537
That's why I slipped her
those three drinks
at the reception.

17:03.604 --> 17:05.606
It's very warm back here!

17:05.674 --> 17:07.674
You need to let Gloria
out of that box.

17:07.759 --> 17:08.742
And...

17:08.810 --> 17:11.077
my dad had
nothing to do with that.

17:11.145 --> 17:13.364
I'm the one who told him
not to give you the message.

17:13.431 --> 17:15.415
Did I miss the "Ta-da"?

17:15.483 --> 17:16.349
Phil, I'm so sorry.

17:16.416 --> 17:18.102
But your business
was just taking off,

17:18.169 --> 17:19.853
and the kids
were really little.
No, no. I-I --
I don't want to hear it.

17:19.921 --> 17:22.723
My own wife is the reason I
don't have a career
in magic --

17:22.790 --> 17:24.773
a thing
I was born to do?!

17:32.483 --> 17:33.617
Look at me!

17:33.684 --> 17:36.153
I haven't changed in 10 years!

17:37.389 --> 17:38.789
Aaah!
Oh!

17:38.857 --> 17:40.257
Aah!

17:44.279 --> 17:46.463
Gloria!

17:46.531 --> 17:48.532
You came! Thank God!

17:48.600 --> 17:49.733
Not because of <i> you.</i>

17:49.801 --> 17:51.167
I couldn't enjoy
my time with Denise

17:51.219 --> 17:52.586
knowing
my mother needed me.

17:52.653 --> 17:54.304
I mean,
I enjoyed it a <i> little.</i>

17:54.372 --> 17:56.874
She's a dance major
trying to replace
food with affection.

17:56.941 --> 17:57.925
I really don't care.

17:57.992 --> 17:59.276
Gloria!

18:00.829 --> 18:02.145
I have a surprise
for you!

18:02.213 --> 18:03.480
I'm here!

18:03.482 --> 18:04.381
Okay.

18:04.449 --> 18:06.450
I was kind of expecting
a bigger reaction.

18:06.517 --> 18:08.885
Yeah, I thought for sure
Manny being here
would tip the scales.

18:08.953 --> 18:12.706
No! I don't need anyone
to do that for me!

18:12.773 --> 18:14.391
Just leave me alone.

18:14.459 --> 18:15.992
What kind of sick game
are you two playing?

18:16.060 --> 18:17.945
Do you have any idea
what I gave up to be here?

18:18.012 --> 18:19.646
What's going on with you,
Gloria?

18:20.715 --> 18:23.483
This dress
doesn't fit me anymore!

18:23.551 --> 18:25.085
That's it?!

18:25.170 --> 18:27.020
I drove all the way
to Manny's dorm for nothing?

18:27.088 --> 18:28.839
Oh, because <i> you've</i> made
the sacrifice today.

18:30.257 --> 18:31.925
You don't understand.

18:31.993 --> 18:34.611
I tell people
that I work hard

18:34.679 --> 18:36.697
to stay fit
and to stay young,

18:36.764 --> 18:40.417
but the reality is
that I barely do anything.

18:40.484 --> 18:42.819
But now my body
is getting...

18:44.289 --> 18:45.405
Bigger?

18:45.473 --> 18:47.641
How dare you!

18:47.709 --> 18:48.842
But yes.

18:48.909 --> 18:51.945
But I've always
looked a certain way.

18:52.012 --> 18:55.282
And now that I don't,
then what am I?

18:55.350 --> 18:59.836
Just a self-trained
hairdresser
ith a hot-sauce business.

18:59.904 --> 19:01.672
You still have that?

19:01.740 --> 19:05.475
Gloria, you're so much more
than how you look.

19:05.543 --> 19:07.061
That's what you say
to people

19:07.128 --> 19:09.046
that are not that pretty
anymore.

19:09.113 --> 19:10.430
Are you insane?

19:10.498 --> 19:13.166
You could be my age
and 30 pounds heavier,

19:13.234 --> 19:15.969
and you would still be
unbelievably out of my league.

19:16.004 --> 19:19.439
Listen, you gain a couple --
who cares?

19:19.507 --> 19:21.441
These have been
the best 10 years of my life.

19:21.509 --> 19:25.412
I'm in it for every pound,
every wrinkle,

19:25.480 --> 19:26.896
every gray hair.

19:28.233 --> 19:31.284
Aww!
Aww!
Aww! Aww!

19:37.075 --> 19:38.859
Come on!

19:40.462 --> 19:42.329
Let's go.
Get in the car.

19:42.464 --> 19:44.264
Where are we going?
Don't worry about it.

19:44.382 --> 19:47.517
Oh. Why should I start making
my own decisions now?

19:51.539 --> 19:53.990
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about the job.

19:54.058 --> 19:55.809
You're just such
a "Go for it" kind of guy --

19:55.876 --> 19:57.528
and I love that
about you --

19:57.595 --> 19:59.663
but in that case,
we had three little kids,

19:59.764 --> 20:01.815
a mortgage,
and I was nervous.

20:01.882 --> 20:03.767
You could have at least
included me in the decision.

20:03.834 --> 20:05.652
You're right!
You're right.

20:05.720 --> 20:08.272
And I know "I'm sorry"
doesn't begin to cover it.

20:08.306 --> 20:09.139
Why are we stopping?

20:09.223 --> 20:10.657
Well, our kids are grown,

20:10.725 --> 20:12.926
I run a company,
you've got a great day job.

20:12.994 --> 20:16.664
I thought maybe it was time
you picked up an old hobby.

20:16.731 --> 20:17.898
Are those -- Uh...

20:19.100 --> 20:20.150
Keys
to your new magic shop.

20:20.217 --> 20:22.152
Oh, my God!

20:24.455 --> 20:25.556
Go on!

20:25.623 --> 20:27.691
What?!
I know!

20:27.759 --> 20:30.110
And Mister Ekshun
was willing to let it go
for next to nothing.

20:30.211 --> 20:31.878
Which,
now that I think of it,

20:31.963 --> 20:33.881
is probably
not a great sign.

20:33.948 --> 20:36.766
This is awesome!

20:36.834 --> 20:39.419
And "Mister Ekshun" --
I just got that!

20:39.487 --> 20:41.004
It's kind of funny
that you're making up

20:41.072 --> 20:43.073
for making a decision
that should have been mine

20:43.140 --> 20:45.108
by making another decision
for me.

20:46.877 --> 20:49.146
Do you want it
or not?

20:49.213 --> 20:50.597
I love you.
I love <i> you.</i>

20:50.665 --> 20:51.798
Mwah!
