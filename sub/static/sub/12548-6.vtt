WEBVTT

00:01.145 --> 00:04.410
I'm not going to annihilate
4.3 million Pakistanis

00:04.545 --> 00:07.480
without hearing from someone
whose authority I recognize.

00:07.590 --> 00:08.991
Our own people
tried to sink us?

00:09.101 --> 00:10.078
We have commandeered

00:10.200 --> 00:11.333
the NATO early warning station

00:11.438 --> 00:12.759
on the island of Sainte Marina.

00:12.876 --> 00:15.001
I am declaring
a 200-mile no-man's-land

00:15.122 --> 00:16.239
around this island.

00:16.360 --> 00:19.540
Test us, and we will all burn.

00:19.650 --> 00:20.883
You've been warned.

00:21.286 --> 00:23.309
_

00:24.061 --> 00:25.876
The intel is all wrong.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.287
What did we do?
We killed the wrong people.

00:30.043 --> 00:32.583
You guys bug out of Pakistan
with a wounded man,

00:32.746 --> 00:35.051
and a few hours later,
the US is nuking the joint?

00:35.165 --> 00:36.564
How do you connect the dots?

00:36.677 --> 00:37.470
You should've killed
those SEALs

00:37.574 --> 00:38.705
when you had the chance.

00:41.496 --> 00:42.737
This is my island.

00:43.343 --> 00:44.622
If I allow your presence,

00:44.742 --> 00:46.506
it comes with certain terms
and conditions.

00:47.066 --> 00:48.789
I could kill you right now.

00:48.966 --> 00:51.097
Do you <i>want</i> a war?

00:51.751 --> 00:53.515
My son is dead.

00:53.629 --> 00:55.277
There will be
no burial for your son

00:55.396 --> 00:56.580
until you surrender.

00:56.707 --> 00:57.678
You're Sam's friend.

00:57.799 --> 00:59.279
Yes. From college.

01:00.475 --> 01:01.281
Mrs. Kendal...

01:01.424 --> 01:02.764
What do you think
about your husband's actions?

01:02.862 --> 01:05.132
He's a government agent
sent to spy on me

01:05.275 --> 01:06.655
and turn me against Sam.

01:06.758 --> 01:08.208
You ever give a damn
about getting home?

01:08.315 --> 01:09.161
Sam, if you had objections--

01:09.274 --> 01:10.827
Maybe you have nowhere to go,
but I do.

02:10.122 --> 02:11.811
What are you doing?

02:25.187 --> 02:26.731
I'm gonna be home soon.

04:09.332 --> 04:09.924
You take it easy.

04:10.023 --> 04:11.479
There's a hundred people
passed out back there.

04:11.599 --> 04:14.482
Listen, my friend.
You're bleeding, okay?

04:14.596 --> 04:15.440
Let me help you. I brought--

04:15.556 --> 04:16.874
You didn't tell me
what happened

04:16.988 --> 04:18.769
to all those people back there.

04:19.094 --> 04:20.262
You don't remember?

04:21.009 --> 04:21.927
Look, it's okay.

04:22.024 --> 04:23.241
You're not well.

04:23.758 --> 04:27.005
You, those people back there,
you've all been drugged.

04:27.602 --> 04:30.783
You need to lie down.
Wait for it to pass.

04:33.658 --> 04:34.619
There's blood on your shoes.

04:34.712 --> 04:35.763
- What? Look--
- Why is there blood on your shoes?

04:35.881 --> 04:36.882
No. I'm just helping--

04:36.987 --> 04:38.646
Tell me what the hell
is going on!

04:38.770 --> 04:40.295
Don't hurt me, please.

04:40.958 --> 04:42.780
I swear on my mother,

04:43.202 --> 04:45.719
your friends were already dead
when I got here.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.227
Aah!

05:14.321 --> 05:16.536
Rest easy, <i>ma puce.</i>

05:17.151 --> 05:18.854
It will end soon enough.

05:18.969 --> 05:20.602
You might even be grateful.

05:21.592 --> 05:22.927
One more for luck.

05:23.386 --> 05:24.634
Aah!

05:25.345 --> 05:30.186
_

05:45.336 --> 05:46.785
Thought you were dead.

05:46.906 --> 05:48.402
I haven't slept like that
in years.

05:48.494 --> 05:49.926
You talk in your sleep.

05:50.038 --> 05:51.087
What do I say?

05:51.174 --> 05:55.016
That's between you and whoever
comes in your dream.

05:55.500 --> 05:58.061
Wouldn't be polite to listen.

06:01.598 --> 06:03.118
Petty Officer
First Class Barry Hopper,

06:03.301 --> 06:04.608
Captain Marcus Chaplin.

06:04.731 --> 06:06.254
It's good to see you're
getting your strength back.

06:06.603 --> 06:08.851
We appreciate you guys coming,
but he actually needs his rest.

06:08.957 --> 06:09.806
Only gonna take a minute.

06:09.927 --> 06:12.050
As I'm sure you're now aware,
the world's a bit different

06:12.222 --> 06:13.579
since we pulled you
out of the water.

06:13.687 --> 06:15.447
Yeah, the guys
have been filling me in.

06:15.546 --> 06:17.202
Well, they can't tell you
what they don't know.

06:17.519 --> 06:18.622
In recent negotiations,

06:18.727 --> 06:21.176
the Secretary of Defense took
a keen interest in all of you.

06:21.306 --> 06:23.027
He seemed quite determined
to have you and your team

06:23.162 --> 06:25.158
- back under his control again.
- It seem odd

06:25.283 --> 06:26.969
that someone that high up
is so concerned with you?

06:27.062 --> 06:28.830
Like I said, we appreciate
you stopping by and all--

06:28.934 --> 06:30.817
No, no, no, they got a point.
Let 'em get to it.

06:30.932 --> 06:32.289
You do have a point, don't you?

06:32.438 --> 06:33.464
Here it is--

06:33.724 --> 06:35.390
If your mission in Pakistan--

06:35.506 --> 06:37.321
something you know about it
or something you did--

06:37.462 --> 06:39.200
makes it unsafe
for you to go back home,

06:40.099 --> 06:41.101
you're welcome here.

06:41.212 --> 06:42.965
Are you kidding me?
Who do you think you are?

06:43.138 --> 06:45.433
You nuked your own country,
you piece of--

06:45.578 --> 06:47.818
You're dead already,

06:47.953 --> 06:49.189
you arrogant son of a bitch.

06:49.298 --> 06:51.418
You're just too stupid
to fall down.

06:57.225 --> 06:59.467
The ones that look like
round doughnuts, the wax apples.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.588
No more, no more.
This is it.

07:01.742 --> 07:03.875
You want more?
Let in some boats.

07:03.989 --> 07:05.378
- So King and Hopper--
- Hey.

07:06.250 --> 07:07.713
You owe me more.

07:09.841 --> 07:12.161
After you leave, they have
a little bedside chat.

07:12.287 --> 07:14.031
Then king puts the other two
gorillas on the door.

07:14.141 --> 07:15.109
He bugs out.

07:15.225 --> 07:16.267
I don't even know how
to eat these things.

07:16.385 --> 07:17.555
- Sirs.
- COB.

07:17.698 --> 07:18.382
How's the crew, COB?

07:18.498 --> 07:19.860
Firing like a one-kick harley.

07:19.975 --> 07:21.302
Just swapping out the crew now.

07:21.554 --> 07:22.854
Sir, you gonna eat
those hairy balls?

07:22.953 --> 07:24.415
I don't even know
what they are.

07:24.524 --> 07:26.284
Chom chom.
It's like litchi.

07:26.383 --> 07:28.027
Hadn't pegged you for
an exotic fruit man, COB.

07:28.141 --> 07:29.653
Don't ask, don't tell.

07:31.237 --> 07:33.041
So the SEALs are
starting to close ranks?

07:33.162 --> 07:34.481
Yeah, they're definitely
hiding something.

07:34.657 --> 07:36.689
I don't see a shoving match
getting us anywhere, though.

07:36.807 --> 07:38.254
Secretary Curry
nearly popped an eyeball

07:38.396 --> 07:39.753
last time I mentioned
those boys.

07:39.917 --> 07:40.637
Let's see what happens

07:40.740 --> 07:42.450
when I tell him
they want to meet the press.

07:47.272 --> 07:49.261
_

07:49.373 --> 07:50.283
That's Sam's wife.

07:50.412 --> 07:53.192
I know, but who's that
handsome gentleman she's with?

07:53.291 --> 07:54.815
- Ms. Girard.
- Get rid of it.

07:54.932 --> 07:56.183
I want to talk
to Secretary of Defense Curry.

07:56.302 --> 07:56.974
Can you work your magic?

07:57.097 --> 07:57.966
Yes. A few minutes.

07:58.079 --> 07:59.194
And I'm gonna need
a video feed.

07:59.306 --> 08:00.735
I'd like to see his reaction
to what I have to say.

08:00.847 --> 08:01.901
We have cameras.

08:02.007 --> 08:04.160
We do have, uh, cameras.

08:04.357 --> 08:05.365
Hey, Sam.

08:05.663 --> 08:06.725
Have a look.

08:11.410 --> 08:12.935
What the hell is that?

08:13.258 --> 08:15.444
That's the guy
keeping your wife warm.

08:15.548 --> 08:16.487
I'm sorry.
You think that's funny?

08:16.591 --> 08:18.098
I think it's sad, actually.

08:18.211 --> 08:19.925
Well, you stand up if you're
gonna talk to me like that, man.

08:20.039 --> 08:21.433
Easy, XO stay on target.

08:21.569 --> 08:24.553
Hey, you, get rid of that
and get me my video feed. Now.

08:24.897 --> 08:26.412
Hey.

08:26.982 --> 08:29.793
I'm sorry. I don't know
what's wrong with him today.

08:29.904 --> 08:32.063
No, it's fine. It's fine.
It's just a picture.

08:45.427 --> 08:47.398
I thought you'd be pleased.

08:47.866 --> 08:50.221
You said you couldn't go home
because Hopper was hurt,

08:50.357 --> 08:52.357
but now he's okay, so--

08:52.482 --> 08:53.383
So now I can go.

08:53.497 --> 08:54.532
Yeah.

08:54.858 --> 08:56.000
I'm ecstatic.

08:56.850 --> 08:57.997
So...

08:59.274 --> 09:00.587
are you...

09:01.576 --> 09:02.560
going home?

09:02.673 --> 09:03.594
I haven't decided.

09:03.712 --> 09:04.685
But you want to.

09:04.797 --> 09:06.027
Doesn't matter what I want.

09:06.149 --> 09:06.932
I got a job to do,

09:07.016 --> 09:08.563
and the bay bridge
doesn't reach this far.

09:08.681 --> 09:10.489
I've always wanted
to see the...

09:11.708 --> 09:13.001
Oh, my God.

09:14.421 --> 09:16.093
That looks like my mom.

09:16.614 --> 09:17.413
What?

09:17.774 --> 09:18.699
Hey. Hey.

09:18.838 --> 09:20.538
- Aah!
- Hold on!

09:25.157 --> 09:25.762
Ah!

09:27.795 --> 09:30.030
Why does my head hurt so much?

09:39.850 --> 09:40.581
You getting through?

09:40.685 --> 09:42.741
Trouble with the relay,
but soon, I think.

09:44.034 --> 09:45.038
You need anything?

09:45.309 --> 09:46.411
No, I'm okay.

09:46.626 --> 09:47.850
And what about my video feed?

09:47.962 --> 09:48.728
I'm working on it.

09:48.814 --> 09:49.683
Well, the sooner the better.

09:49.839 --> 09:52.336
Look, mate, unless you know
how to do my job,

09:52.481 --> 09:55.219
why don't you just chill out
and let me do my job?

09:56.505 --> 09:57.620
Okay.

09:58.133 --> 10:00.097
We got a serious issue in town.

10:00.212 --> 10:00.856
One second, COB.

10:00.965 --> 10:02.682
- Okay, your line is open.
- Yeah, hold the line.

10:02.807 --> 10:03.905
Nigel, I need the video feed.

10:04.026 --> 10:05.515
Cross your legs, sister.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.069
I said I was working on it.

10:07.203 --> 10:08.404
I don't know
what your problem is,

10:08.546 --> 10:11.263
but you sort it out,
and you sort it out right now.

10:18.234 --> 10:21.851
Problem sorted.

10:22.262 --> 10:25.298
Please, everyone, just--
just stop talking.

10:25.442 --> 10:26.367
Please.

10:26.498 --> 10:28.174
Oh, it's so loud in here.

10:28.665 --> 10:30.584
Same thing's happening
all over town.

10:30.698 --> 10:32.483
I've seen this party before,
and it's not good.

10:32.582 --> 10:33.770
We've been dosed.

10:34.149 --> 10:36.324
It's a pretty serious drug
called BZ.

10:36.447 --> 10:38.379
Military designed it,
nickname Buzz.

10:38.488 --> 10:39.237
I was a Guinea pig.

10:39.349 --> 10:41.933
Me and some buddies volunteered
back when music didn't suck.

10:42.044 --> 10:43.169
Extra cash was nice,

10:43.277 --> 10:45.012
but even at a low dose,
it was no picnic.

10:45.108 --> 10:46.006
There any good news?

10:46.101 --> 10:46.997
Well, it doesn't kill you.

10:47.112 --> 10:47.714
Found it.

10:47.823 --> 10:50.308
Um, "BZ is an odorless
military incapacitating agent.

10:50.460 --> 10:52.693
The central effects include
delusions, poor judgment,

10:52.814 --> 10:56.611
memory blackouts, paranoia,
illusions, hallucinations.

10:56.895 --> 10:59.660
Ultimately, the victims
will lose consciousness."

10:59.769 --> 11:01.454
Symptoms last
about eight hours.

11:01.990 --> 11:03.216
This is a coordinated attack.

11:03.328 --> 11:04.222
Yeah, but how'd it get here?

11:04.332 --> 11:06.381
Well, in the experiment,
they mixed it with lemonade.

11:06.517 --> 11:08.119
Well, the island's only got
one main water supply.

11:08.215 --> 11:10.135
- They dose that, they knock out everyone.
- Smart.

11:10.289 --> 11:10.936
Countermeasures?

11:11.068 --> 11:12.989
Well, the docs used adrenaline
to snap me out of it.

11:13.096 --> 11:15.375
Can also use epinephrine,
epipens, allergy shots.

11:15.509 --> 11:17.012
Colorado has those
in the med locker.

11:17.119 --> 11:18.519
Hospital here
would have some, too.

11:18.651 --> 11:19.946
We gotta move fast.

11:20.505 --> 11:21.889
All right, COB,
Lieutenant, you're with me.

11:21.997 --> 11:23.140
We're gonna dive
and hide the sub.

11:23.317 --> 11:25.028
Ride it out with the meds
we have on board.

11:25.127 --> 11:26.520
XO, you've got the island.

11:26.669 --> 11:27.965
Get the epipens
from the hospital,

11:28.077 --> 11:29.356
inject yourself
and enough crewmen

11:29.478 --> 11:31.436
to repair and defend the EWS.

11:31.621 --> 11:33.703
Stay awake and alive
for the next eight hours,

11:33.865 --> 11:35.199
'cause something bad's coming.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.058
Just entering deep water, sir.

11:42.164 --> 11:43.215
Heading 1-5-3.

11:43.385 --> 11:45.481
Ahead two-thirds.
Steady as she goes.

11:46.946 --> 11:48.372
Are you still with me,
Lieutenant?

11:48.809 --> 11:49.735
All the way, sir.

11:49.853 --> 11:50.450
Report, COB.

11:50.632 --> 11:51.364
According to
this drug inventory,

11:51.475 --> 11:53.638
Cortez should be coming back
with 20 epipens.

11:53.772 --> 11:54.626
Only 20?

11:54.730 --> 11:56.818
There's not a lot of bees
on submarines, ma'am.

11:57.572 --> 12:00.197
Essential personnel on the conn
and engine room get shots first.

12:00.300 --> 12:01.332
Department heads after that.

12:01.441 --> 12:02.418
That's gonna leave
a whole lot of the crew

12:02.527 --> 12:03.558
crawling out of their skins.

12:03.659 --> 12:06.289
So we babysit
and hope for the best.

12:06.406 --> 12:07.905
Why should today
be any different?

12:08.195 --> 12:09.892
Sir, they're gone.

12:10.015 --> 12:12.850
Sir, the epi shots--
medical locker was broken into.

12:12.957 --> 12:14.567
- What are you talking about?
- Someone stole 'em.

12:14.752 --> 12:15.522
So we have nothing?

12:15.656 --> 12:17.037
And some of the crew's
already freaking out,

12:17.137 --> 12:18.183
acting weird.

12:18.788 --> 12:20.314
What do we do, sir?

12:22.290 --> 12:23.406
We dive.

12:30.943 --> 12:32.781
You owe me!
You owe me more!

12:32.895 --> 12:34.345
Hey, get off of me!

12:38.289 --> 12:39.525
Aah!

12:41.260 --> 12:42.847
Christine, what are you doing?

12:44.819 --> 12:46.707
<i>You're never coming home,</i>
<i>are you?</i>

12:46.945 --> 12:47.672
What?

12:49.031 --> 12:51.328
I'm sorry, sir.
Just really thirsty.

12:51.456 --> 12:52.955
Pitts, it's okay.
Come with me. We gotta--

12:53.064 --> 12:53.919
I need water.

12:54.415 --> 12:55.518
I need water.

12:55.623 --> 12:57.729
Hey, Pitts. Pitts, Pitts,
Pitts, listen to me.

12:57.850 --> 12:59.357
We're under attack, okay?

12:59.457 --> 13:01.022
We have been drugged.
I need your help. Come on.

13:01.126 --> 13:01.993
Yes, sir.

13:02.092 --> 13:03.309
But I gotta get water!

13:03.680 --> 13:05.669
It's <i>in</i> the water, Pitts!

13:08.794 --> 13:13.321
_

13:45.743 --> 13:46.591
You may find also

13:46.728 --> 13:50.054
yourself feeling lightheaded
or sleepy.

13:50.167 --> 13:51.148
That's fine.

13:51.424 --> 13:52.750
When that happens,

13:52.871 --> 13:54.682
I want you to step away
from your position

13:54.895 --> 13:57.623
and secure yourself
in your bunk.

13:57.729 --> 13:59.159
I realize we're running...

14:00.521 --> 14:02.192
I realize we're running
a skeleton crew.

14:02.569 --> 14:04.212
But we will ride out this storm

14:04.588 --> 14:07.157
hovering here at s--
a safe depth

14:07.663 --> 14:08.972
and return to port unharmed.

14:09.080 --> 14:10.458
Captain out.

14:28.981 --> 14:30.290
Hey, man.

14:30.888 --> 14:31.688
Hey, man.

14:31.788 --> 14:34.274
You messed up?
You don't seem too messed up.

14:34.389 --> 14:35.213
Neither do you.

14:35.322 --> 14:37.161
Popped some "go pills." Where
you goin' with the toothpick?

14:37.257 --> 14:38.873
Got some business with Serrat.

14:40.729 --> 14:42.704
Guess that makess u partners.

14:51.980 --> 14:53.070
Ah, she's still out of it.

14:53.393 --> 14:54.735
That BZ hit her hard.

14:54.844 --> 14:56.318
Probably a vegetarian.

14:56.829 --> 14:58.289
I think she likes me, though.

14:59.418 --> 15:01.014
Come on! Wake up, already!

15:02.296 --> 15:04.821
Here.
Give her these.

15:04.930 --> 15:06.615
- Two?
- Whatever it takes to bring her back.

15:06.712 --> 15:07.965
It's too much.
You're going to stop her heart.

15:08.069 --> 15:09.147
Try to hit a vein or something.

15:09.250 --> 15:10.487
I want that comm up in 15.

15:10.582 --> 15:12.331
You're not going to get
anything fixed if you kill her.

15:12.432 --> 15:14.198
She's French.
She's all heart.

15:14.319 --> 15:15.528
She'll be fine.

15:17.762 --> 15:18.863
They got cross-fire.

15:18.965 --> 15:20.460
We won't get three steps.

15:20.662 --> 15:22.311
Let's go, sweetheart.
Up and at 'em.

15:22.623 --> 15:23.372
Are you mad?

15:23.459 --> 15:24.366
What is wrong with you?
There's no need for you to--

15:24.460 --> 15:25.485
Oh, my God. Shut up.

15:25.579 --> 15:28.060
Look, I don't have time
to do it the nice way.

15:28.169 --> 15:30.216
We made
a very simple arrangement.

15:30.337 --> 15:31.358
This was not a part of it.

15:31.465 --> 15:34.557
Neither was killing you,
but everything's negotiable.

15:38.878 --> 15:41.808
I gotta tell you,

15:42.172 --> 15:44.646
I'm really kind of pissed
you broke my arm.

15:45.019 --> 15:45.911
They got Hopper.

15:46.030 --> 15:47.446
You should drink more milk.

15:47.774 --> 15:50.274
Did you enjoy your
cavity search, by the way?

15:50.380 --> 15:51.149
Did you?

15:51.251 --> 15:52.899
Now that we know
where it is not,

15:53.392 --> 15:55.212
let's talk about where it is.

15:55.337 --> 15:57.271
Told you,
I don't know where it is.

15:58.056 --> 16:00.649
That attitude is gonna get
a lot of people killed

16:01.299 --> 16:02.604
for no reason.

16:04.684 --> 16:06.219
Who are these guys?

16:06.609 --> 16:08.621
What the hell
are they looking for?

16:12.003 --> 16:13.179
_

16:13.318 --> 16:14.155
We're under attack, okay?

16:14.266 --> 16:15.594
We have been drugged.
I need your help. Come on.

16:15.679 --> 16:17.244
Yes, sir.
But I gotta get water!

16:17.350 --> 16:19.913
It's <i>in</i> the water, Pitts!

16:42.156 --> 16:44.297
<i>You're never</i>
<i>coming back, are you?</i>

16:47.026 --> 16:48.785
Oh, God. You're not real.
I know you're not real.

16:48.887 --> 16:50.539
<i>Don't you trust me?</i>

16:52.500 --> 16:54.359
<i>Don't you trust yourself?</i>

17:03.019 --> 17:04.327
Aah!

17:11.194 --> 17:12.050
Ah.

17:15.308 --> 17:16.655
Who are you?

17:17.125 --> 17:18.059
What are you talking about?

17:18.156 --> 17:18.905
Who are you?

17:19.003 --> 17:21.121
Whoa. XO, hang on.
You know me.

17:21.248 --> 17:22.834
I don't know you.
What are you doing in here?

17:22.941 --> 17:25.016
My arm was broken.
I had to-- I had to set it.

17:25.384 --> 17:26.467
Did you kill those men
out there?

17:26.589 --> 17:28.573
No, no, no, no, no,
it was-- it was Hopper, sir.

17:28.662 --> 17:30.942
He went-- he went...
He went crazy,

17:31.042 --> 17:32.158
attacked us.

17:33.714 --> 17:35.054
He broke my arm.

17:37.221 --> 17:40.364
No. I don't know you.
I don't know you.

17:40.954 --> 17:43.205
It's that drug, sir.
It's messing with your mind.

17:43.392 --> 17:45.151
I'm Jim McClure.
I'm in supply.

17:45.256 --> 17:46.237
No, no, no, no.

17:46.303 --> 17:47.675
Hang on. You know me.

17:47.895 --> 17:49.349
You're Lieutenant Commander
Sam Kendal.

17:49.460 --> 17:50.897
You're the XO on the Colorado.

17:51.105 --> 17:52.897
It's just the drugs, sir.
It's--

17:52.998 --> 17:54.201
It gets you confused.

17:54.360 --> 17:55.604
That drug is making
everyone crazy.

17:55.712 --> 17:58.279
It makes you see things,
think things that aren't--

17:58.405 --> 17:59.395
aren't real.

18:01.721 --> 18:02.847
You okay?

18:04.267 --> 18:05.071
I...

18:05.170 --> 18:06.659
You need help?
I can help you.

18:07.133 --> 18:08.979
I, uh, I need epi shots.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.712
Epinephrine, it-- it helps
counteract the...

18:14.866 --> 18:16.091
Already checked.

18:16.280 --> 18:17.477
They're-- they're gone.

18:24.913 --> 18:26.158
- He's unconscious.
- Yeah.

18:26.286 --> 18:28.056
Did you want me to try
and get him to a bunk or--

18:28.178 --> 18:29.912
We'll move him
when the COB gets back.

18:30.046 --> 18:32.846
Sir, I'm feeling a lit--
I--

18:32.955 --> 18:35.000
I need you here, Lieutenant,
with me.

18:35.312 --> 18:35.775
With me.

18:35.876 --> 18:36.983
Can you handle that?

18:37.231 --> 18:38.397
Yes, sir.

18:38.915 --> 18:39.826
I'm here, sir.

18:45.803 --> 18:47.069
We got a fire in machinery one.

18:47.173 --> 18:49.358
If that fire gets to the air
in the storage tanks--

18:49.463 --> 18:51.874
I'm aware. Shut down
the oxygen header, Lieutenant.

18:52.063 --> 18:53.535
How much air
does that leave us?

18:53.654 --> 18:55.098
Whatever you can smell.

19:02.516 --> 19:03.718
Machinery one, conn.
Report.

19:03.820 --> 19:05.570
Report status on the fire.

19:08.030 --> 19:09.605
They could all be passed out
down there.

19:09.700 --> 19:11.005
COB!

19:12.610 --> 19:13.896
COB, where are you?

19:16.310 --> 19:17.692
Lieutenant Shepard,
you have the conn.

19:17.844 --> 19:18.847
Sir.

19:19.412 --> 19:21.664
If someone doesn't get that fire
out and the air back on,

19:21.779 --> 19:24.059
we all go to sleep,
never wake up.

19:26.075 --> 19:27.345
Keep her steady.

19:32.166 --> 19:33.212
I need to get ahold
of the Colorado

19:33.325 --> 19:34.580
to see if they need any help.

19:34.684 --> 19:36.096
Oh, there's power.

19:36.271 --> 19:38.398
Can you key the signal
for me, XO?

19:38.504 --> 19:39.564
Mm-hmm.

19:45.309 --> 19:47.103
<i>How come</i>
<i>we don't have kids, Sam?</i>

19:49.947 --> 19:51.553
<i>Is it 'cause you're never home?</i>

19:52.724 --> 19:53.741
Look...

19:53.831 --> 19:55.253
We gotta wake up
your French friend.

19:56.254 --> 19:57.055
You hear me?

19:57.211 --> 20:00.773
Hey. We gotta get that French
señorita back on her feet.

20:00.875 --> 20:02.547
Only way this thing's
getting fixed.

20:11.288 --> 20:13.589
Hey. Sophie, wake up.

20:13.708 --> 20:15.090
_

20:15.203 --> 20:16.001
Hey, look at me.

20:16.113 --> 20:18.007
Look, look--
hey, open your eyes.

20:18.108 --> 20:19.400
You need to focus on me.
Here, look.

20:19.508 --> 20:21.978
_

20:22.077 --> 20:23.177
Sophie, you gotta wake up.

20:23.292 --> 20:24.639
I need to get
the radio fixed now.

20:24.744 --> 20:27.565
He will kill us...
all for money.

20:29.583 --> 20:30.577
XO...

20:30.726 --> 20:32.419
need you
to key the signal again.

20:42.019 --> 20:43.748
I was hoping
to avoid this, but...

20:49.174 --> 20:51.211
I guess I can always
kill you later.

21:21.775 --> 21:23.362
<i>Hi, daddy.</i>

21:26.919 --> 21:28.086
Jeffrey?

22:25.100 --> 22:26.662
<i>You came home!</i>

22:28.439 --> 22:30.335
<i>I am so happy</i>
<i>you're here, babe.</i>

22:31.312 --> 22:33.543
<i>Aren't you gonna sit down?</i>

22:45.607 --> 22:46.674
<i>You were gone for so long,</i>

22:46.806 --> 22:48.494
<i>I thought you were never</i>
<i>coming home.</i>

22:50.421 --> 22:52.664
<i>Why are you always</i>
<i>leaving me alone, Sam?</i>

22:52.811 --> 22:54.715
I don't want to leave you alone.
But I have to. I'm sorry.

22:54.816 --> 22:56.120
<i>You're not sorry.</i>

22:56.227 --> 22:57.637
<i>When Marcus offered</i>
<i>you that desk job,</i>

22:57.748 --> 22:59.356
<i>your first thought was...</i>

22:59.992 --> 23:02.954
<i>God, I hope Christine</i>
<i>doesn't find out about that.</i>

23:05.514 --> 23:06.964
No, it wasn't.

23:07.157 --> 23:09.523
<i>Hmm? It wasn't?</i>

23:13.489 --> 23:15.463
Look, I just want
my own command. That's all.

23:15.579 --> 23:16.715
<i>Is that just another</i>
<i>one of those things</i>

23:16.830 --> 23:18.798
<i>that you hope Christine</i>
<i>doesn't find out about?</i>

23:18.900 --> 23:19.998
You don't know what it's like.

23:20.097 --> 23:22.464
<i>To be tortured?</i>

23:22.790 --> 23:24.475
<i>What did they do to you?</i>

23:25.789 --> 23:26.901
<i>I love you.</i>

23:27.011 --> 23:28.052
<i>Don't you want me to love you?</i>

23:28.161 --> 23:28.954
Of course I do.

23:29.056 --> 23:29.793
<i>Then why don't you trust me?</i>

23:29.907 --> 23:30.779
I do trust you.

23:30.879 --> 23:32.120
<i>What is it then?</i>

23:38.209 --> 23:40.159
I don't trust myself.

23:40.957 --> 23:42.358
<i>Well, you shouldn't.</i>

23:44.222 --> 23:46.234
<i>And you shouldn't trust him.</i>

23:48.469 --> 23:50.665
Help me out, would you?

23:50.757 --> 23:51.941
I only got one arm.

23:52.082 --> 23:53.140
Damn, that hurts.

23:56.822 --> 23:58.150
Um...

24:02.903 --> 24:04.225
Are you okay?

24:04.350 --> 24:05.382
_

24:05.543 --> 24:07.433
She'll come around.
Just give her a minute.

24:21.244 --> 24:22.687
Hey, remind me of your name.

24:24.101 --> 24:24.844
McClure.

24:24.954 --> 24:26.422
- McClure in supply.
- Yeah.

24:26.523 --> 24:27.814
And you report to
senior watch...

24:27.959 --> 24:30.306
Chief Arnold.
Bill Arnold from Ohio.

24:30.458 --> 24:32.979
Right. Right, Bill Arnold.

24:34.092 --> 24:36.080
Right, right, right. Sorry.

24:36.727 --> 24:38.809
He got promoted last month.

24:43.744 --> 24:44.685
Ohh!

24:48.324 --> 24:49.360
Oh!

25:23.174 --> 25:23.947
Who are you?

25:24.112 --> 25:25.749
Huh?! Why are you here?

25:31.218 --> 25:32.526
What are you doing, Sam?

25:32.643 --> 25:34.463
I'm gonna fix everything.
You'll see, Christine.

25:35.906 --> 25:37.949
I'm gonna be home soon.
I promise.

25:38.226 --> 25:39.168
I promise.

25:43.225 --> 25:44.624
Who are you?

25:46.915 --> 25:47.914
Tell me.

25:49.231 --> 25:50.420
Tell me!

25:52.765 --> 25:57.532
_

25:57.877 --> 25:58.978
I don't know.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.170
Guess.

26:00.510 --> 26:01.608
"U"?

26:02.420 --> 26:03.537
Hmm.

26:06.321 --> 26:07.805
You're terrible at this.

26:07.973 --> 26:09.465
By the way,
it was "gypsy."

26:09.928 --> 26:10.994
How are we doing back there?

26:11.096 --> 26:12.265
One second.

26:12.716 --> 26:13.934
Yeah, you keep saying that.

26:14.048 --> 26:16.290
You do know how long
one second is, right?

26:16.387 --> 26:18.304
It takes how long it takes.

26:18.776 --> 26:19.576
Mm.

26:21.385 --> 26:23.479
Hey, hey!
Like a Christmas tree.

26:23.596 --> 26:25.573
<i>Joyeux Noel,</i> huh, <i>mon ami?</i>

26:25.704 --> 26:26.855
You are not my friend.

26:26.964 --> 26:29.438
Devastating. So do we have
a working comm or what?

26:29.539 --> 26:34.043
I have to, um, reset power
for the antenna downstairs.

26:36.212 --> 26:37.424
Go with her.

26:38.212 --> 26:40.277
Almost out of your hair,
Mr. Serrat.

26:40.388 --> 26:41.398
I'll miss you.

26:41.510 --> 26:42.946
Yeah, well,
I'm gonna bring this up now

26:43.056 --> 26:44.602
'cause I don't want you
pitching a fit later.

26:44.778 --> 26:47.223
When she's done, she's dead.

26:47.377 --> 26:48.189
What?

26:48.317 --> 26:49.843
No, no, this isn't-- no!

26:49.942 --> 26:50.987
Good, get it out now

26:51.102 --> 26:53.078
'cause, yeah, she's seen
a lot of faces.

26:53.195 --> 26:54.362
I will be responsible for her.

26:54.480 --> 26:55.312
I will make sure--

26:55.527 --> 26:57.082
What was that?

26:58.059 --> 26:59.511
There's no reason to--

27:00.563 --> 27:02.479
It's a long game.

27:02.743 --> 27:05.360
Don't get yourself hanged
on the first day.

27:08.132 --> 27:09.698
Get Hopper ready to move.

27:09.942 --> 27:11.267
And tie him up good this time

27:11.389 --> 27:13.626
so he doesn't screw
anyone's health plan.

27:19.325 --> 27:20.230
That's it?

27:20.350 --> 27:21.405
One more.

27:23.867 --> 27:25.894
Easy. Easy.
Easy. You okay?

27:26.006 --> 27:28.339
I'm gonna get you out of here,
but we need your help.

27:28.461 --> 27:30.059
We're gonna go back upstairs
like there's nothing wrong.

27:30.192 --> 27:31.353
I'm gonna be right behind you.

27:31.451 --> 27:32.474
And I'll be right behind him.

27:32.568 --> 27:33.849
When you go in, you go in fast.

27:33.951 --> 27:35.390
You get to the comm,
get down on the floor.

27:35.584 --> 27:36.323
You understand?

27:36.425 --> 27:38.442
Yes, I understand.

27:38.659 --> 27:39.283
Okay.

27:39.385 --> 27:42.193
Hey.
I got the cross-fire twins.

27:42.327 --> 27:43.237
You take the other one.

27:43.331 --> 27:44.836
Okay, remember,
broken arm stays alive.

27:44.981 --> 27:47.046
I don't know what you think
you're fighting for, friend.

27:47.143 --> 27:50.145
Flag waving, saluting,
world policing--

27:50.259 --> 27:52.065
It's all just part of
the commercial.

27:53.084 --> 27:53.953
Well?

27:54.061 --> 27:56.143
Almost. Almost.
I-I am very close.

27:56.255 --> 27:59.136
A few final connections.

27:59.249 --> 28:00.254
Good.

28:00.369 --> 28:02.278
Will you key the signal for me?

28:02.379 --> 28:03.528
Say when.

28:03.696 --> 28:04.772
Almost.

28:08.210 --> 28:09.257
Aah!

28:13.715 --> 28:15.252
Who are these people?
Who sent them?

28:15.362 --> 28:15.969
I don't know.

28:16.091 --> 28:18.478
What are you doing?
He just saved your life.

28:18.573 --> 28:19.279
What do they want?!

28:19.381 --> 28:21.761
Him and his friend Hopper.

28:23.197 --> 28:24.450
There was to be no harm.

28:24.935 --> 28:26.807
They told me, put their drug
in the water,

28:26.909 --> 28:27.975
and you would go to sleep.

28:28.077 --> 28:30.019
When you woke, there would be
no reason for you to stay.

28:30.988 --> 28:32.906
They promised me
my island back!

28:33.845 --> 28:34.930
They lied.

28:38.121 --> 28:40.875
That is what I know.
The rest is as you see.

28:51.958 --> 28:53.524
Get out of here.

29:02.091 --> 29:05.344
- Please help me get the comm back online.
- Hopper.

29:05.600 --> 29:07.714
Hopefully there's still
a sub out there somewhere.

29:33.480 --> 29:34.573
Air.

29:34.740 --> 29:37.143
You gotta turn
the oxygen back on.

30:04.017 --> 30:05.379
You sleepy?

30:06.186 --> 30:07.310
Yeah?

30:08.813 --> 30:10.002
Me too.

30:15.206 --> 30:16.419
What story
you want to do tonight?

30:16.508 --> 30:18.109
<i>The-- the peacock.</i>

30:19.444 --> 30:21.017
That's a good one.

30:21.687 --> 30:23.634
Okay.

30:33.634 --> 30:35.373
A peacock...

30:35.480 --> 30:36.912
spreading his gorgeous tail

30:38.100 --> 30:40.761
made fun of a crane
that was passing by.

30:42.030 --> 30:43.400
The peacock...

30:44.603 --> 30:47.201
laughed at the dusty color
of the crane's feathers

30:47.299 --> 30:48.622
and said...

30:50.011 --> 30:52.091
"I am robed like a king,

30:52.665 --> 30:56.027
while you have not
a bit of color on your wings."

30:56.136 --> 30:58.462
"That's true,"
replied the crane.

30:59.220 --> 31:01.716
"But I soar to the heights
of heaven.

31:02.158 --> 31:07.158
While you only walk below,

31:07.278 --> 31:08.730
like a...

31:10.179 --> 31:12.135
like a rat."

31:21.803 --> 31:24.590
EWS to Colorado.
Come in, Colorado.

31:26.426 --> 31:27.973
Are you sure it's working?

31:28.503 --> 31:30.596
Yes, it should be.

31:31.683 --> 31:33.999
Come in, Colorado.
This is the XO.

31:37.216 --> 31:39.209
Can you please, can you
just recheck the signal?

31:39.479 --> 31:41.737
The signal is good.
I have checked.

31:41.867 --> 31:43.247
Um, perhaps they have
a problem--

31:43.350 --> 31:45.529
<i>Can you please</i> just
recheck the signal? Please.

31:45.643 --> 31:48.204
Don't get angry, okay?
I'm doing my best.

31:48.475 --> 31:49.550
I'm not. I'm not.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

31:49.633 --> 31:51.496
I'm sorry. I'm not.
I'm not.

31:51.618 --> 31:54.676
It is difficult in this place

31:54.799 --> 31:56.169
for everyone.

31:56.842 --> 31:58.218
You seem to be handling it
very well.

31:58.321 --> 32:00.070
I promise you, I'm not.

32:01.989 --> 32:05.346
There is a line of morals,
okay?

32:05.701 --> 32:08.970
When you cross this line,
you never have peace.

32:14.162 --> 32:15.371
Mm.

32:15.513 --> 32:18.078
You-- you have
some blood on your forehead.

32:22.645 --> 32:24.123
Sorry.

32:28.221 --> 32:31.645
Uh, EWS to Colorado.
Come in, Colorado.

33:23.742 --> 33:26.503
EWS to Colorado.
Come in, Colorado.

33:29.173 --> 33:31.967
EWS to Colorado.
Come in, Colorado.

33:34.142 --> 33:35.502
Roger, EWS.

33:35.619 --> 33:37.115
We're about 5 miles out,

33:37.230 --> 33:38.798
and it looks like
the sub's all right.

33:38.923 --> 33:40.401
We'll wait for the crew
to wake up, and we'll

33:40.508 --> 33:42.589
make our way back
once we get an all clear.

33:42.870 --> 33:44.116
How are things on the beach?

33:44.224 --> 33:45.636
EWS is secure, sir.

33:45.790 --> 33:47.111
Not without a body count,
though,

33:47.214 --> 33:48.786
including two
of the SEALs--

33:48.926 --> 33:50.502
Vogler and Monk.

33:50.973 --> 33:53.099
Roger that. Colorado out.

33:57.201 --> 33:58.552
Why'd those guys
want me and you?

33:58.656 --> 33:59.410
Why do you think?

33:59.509 --> 34:00.827
We were the two
in the room in Pakistan.

34:00.928 --> 34:02.656
We're the only ones who know
why the bullets started flying.

34:02.759 --> 34:05.331
All I know is, we killed the guy
we were sent in to save.

34:05.568 --> 34:07.198
I still don't know why.

34:07.762 --> 34:09.154
The mission directive
got changed

34:09.261 --> 34:11.244
from extraction to elimination.

34:11.431 --> 34:12.972
I wasn't given new orders.

34:13.924 --> 34:15.456
I was.

34:20.632 --> 34:21.661
Enter.

34:23.295 --> 34:25.137
Sir, relief crew is on board.

34:25.268 --> 34:26.536
Everyone else
is already ashore.

34:26.641 --> 34:28.426
I've got a skiff waiting to
take you back if you're ready.

34:28.532 --> 34:30.324
I'm just gonna scrape off
the fuzz, Lieutenant.

34:30.489 --> 34:31.766
After 30 years of shaving
in the Navy,

34:31.868 --> 34:33.344
I have a tendency
to cut myself on land.

34:33.446 --> 34:34.878
Understood. Don't think
I'll be holding anything sharp

34:35.047 --> 34:36.083
for a little while.

34:36.197 --> 34:37.219
I'll be right up.

34:54.261 --> 34:56.001
Serrat was obviously
the man on the inside.

34:56.107 --> 34:57.134
I don't know how he got the BZ,

34:57.245 --> 34:58.652
but he got it in the water.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.458
If their leader
survives the gunshot,

35:00.572 --> 35:01.901
maybe we can ask him.

35:02.153 --> 35:03.826
It's interesting that someone
was able to contact him

35:03.957 --> 35:05.209
and set up the attack.

35:05.985 --> 35:08.595
Maybe he's got a radio
or-- or a sat phone?

35:08.933 --> 35:10.792
Or maybe someone
on our crew helped him.

35:11.828 --> 35:13.584
You think someone on our crew
is working...

35:14.067 --> 35:15.158
Working for who?

35:15.711 --> 35:16.677
I don't know.

35:16.775 --> 35:19.817
But when I was unconscious,
someone took my firing key.

35:20.884 --> 35:23.696
We now have no nuclear
launch capabilities.

35:24.028 --> 35:25.043
If the plan was
to steal the key,

35:25.152 --> 35:26.202
then how come
we're still alive?

35:26.316 --> 35:28.041
That doesn't make any sense.

35:28.575 --> 35:30.730
We are defenseless
without our firing key.

35:30.849 --> 35:31.978
Maybe they want
to make us sweat.

35:32.084 --> 35:33.284
Maybe they're on the way here.

35:33.407 --> 35:35.083
Maybe their plan was to
extract their men first.

35:35.225 --> 35:37.774
Either way,
we have to find the key.

35:38.907 --> 35:40.461
You should get that
taken care of.

35:41.111 --> 35:42.488
I will.

35:42.618 --> 35:43.833
Must have been
a hell of a fight.

35:47.510 --> 35:49.484
Honestly, I don't remember.

35:51.825 --> 35:53.406
It'll come back to you.

35:53.624 --> 35:55.060
Most of it, at least.

36:08.512 --> 36:10.035
Who are you?

36:10.972 --> 36:12.618
What are you doing here?

36:15.292 --> 36:16.384
Tell me.

36:17.675 --> 36:18.783
Tell me!

36:18.887 --> 36:19.740
<i>Stop it.</i>

36:19.855 --> 36:22.654
<i>Stop lying to me, Sam.</i>

36:22.755 --> 36:23.445
What?

36:23.578 --> 36:25.629
<i>Hey, Sam. I haven't</i>
<i>seen you for a while.</i>

36:27.438 --> 36:29.172
Paul?

36:29.368 --> 36:31.052
Why are you in my house?

36:31.837 --> 36:33.571
What are you doing
with my wife?

36:34.193 --> 36:34.965
<i>You think Christine's</i>

36:35.101 --> 36:36.457
<i>the kind of woman</i>
<i>that's gonna wait forever</i>

36:36.575 --> 36:37.973
<i>for you to come home?</i>

36:38.139 --> 36:39.374
<i>I mean, God, look at her.</i>

36:39.479 --> 36:41.064
It's not forever. Why is he
saying forever? I told you--

36:41.168 --> 36:42.945
<i>Look how beautiful she is.</i>

36:43.039 --> 36:44.868
<i>And you're gonna leave this</i>
<i>unattended, buddy?</i>

36:45.117 --> 36:46.291
<i>Women have needs.</i>

36:46.410 --> 36:49.613
<i>If you don't...</i>
<i>I sure as hell will.</i>

36:49.741 --> 36:51.563
<i>This is the beginning</i>
<i>of the end, Sam.</i>

36:51.675 --> 36:53.060
What are you talking about?
No, it's not.

36:53.162 --> 36:54.637
<i>Look.</i>

37:00.940 --> 37:02.837
<i>Look what you did to him.</i>

37:03.509 --> 37:05.335
<i>You almost killed him.</i>

37:10.332 --> 37:12.270
<i>I'll always love you.</i>

37:17.139 --> 37:17.948
<i>Don't leave me.</i>

37:18.070 --> 37:19.651
I can't lose you.
I'm not gonna lose you.

37:19.755 --> 37:21.332
<i>Then come home.</i>

37:24.080 --> 37:25.779
I have to finish this.

37:25.905 --> 37:27.231
If I don't, my people will die.

37:27.338 --> 37:28.536
I'm not gonna let that happen.

37:28.638 --> 37:30.137
<i>What about us, Sam?</i>

37:32.081 --> 37:33.433
<i>You do that...</i>

37:34.715 --> 37:36.042
<i>I'll be gone,</i>

37:37.659 --> 37:40.042
<i>and you may never see me again.</i>

37:40.178 --> 37:41.701
<i>Why would you do that?</i>

37:44.024 --> 37:45.747
<i>Stay.</i>

37:52.644 --> 37:54.089
I'm sorry.

37:56.382 --> 37:58.891
<i>You're never coming back,</i>
<i>are you?</i>

38:01.291 --> 38:02.564
Everything's gonna be
different now.

38:02.669 --> 38:03.866
<i>Stop it.</i>

38:03.972 --> 38:06.265
I always find my way back,
don't I?

38:09.866 --> 38:11.412
<i>What are you doing?</i>

38:39.565 --> 38:41.311
I'm gonna be home soon.

38:42.169 --> 38:43.693
I promise.

38:53.795 --> 38:56.255
I just, uh, wanted to
say good night

38:56.364 --> 38:59.091
and, uh, to apologize again
for anything I may have--

38:59.191 --> 39:01.438
You weren't yourself, so...

39:01.539 --> 39:03.193
No, I, um...

39:03.480 --> 39:04.767
I suppose not.

39:07.212 --> 39:08.950
Uh, what are you working on?

39:09.208 --> 39:11.755
The cameras were still recording
during the attack.

39:11.895 --> 39:13.748
Oh, brilliant.
Can I-- can I see?

39:13.881 --> 39:15.034
Oh, tomorrow?

39:15.174 --> 39:17.429
Um, it's been
a long day, right?

39:30.747 --> 39:33.451
<i>Everything's gonna be</i>
<i>different now. I promise.</i>
