WEBVTT

00:01.660 --> 00:03.500
GIORGIO A. TSOUKALOS:
This design has been taken

00:03.500 --> 00:05.040
from a text that's at least

00:05.040 --> 00:08.210
1,800 years old.

00:08.210 --> 00:10.420
TRAVIS TAYLOR:
Our vehicle

00:10.420 --> 00:11.920
was showing positive lift,

00:11.920 --> 00:13.470
like an aircraft would.

00:13.470 --> 00:15.430
TSOUKALOS:
So the information contained

00:15.430 --> 00:19.260
in the ancient texts
is indeed accurate.

00:19.260 --> 00:22.600
PRAVEEN MOHAN:
Now, this is a vast medical text

00:22.600 --> 00:24.350
and it's considered
the foundation

00:24.350 --> 00:25.850
of traditional Indian medicine.

00:25.850 --> 00:27.190
TSOUKALOS:
Oh, so this is the basis

00:27.190 --> 00:28.480
for Ayurvedic medicine?

00:28.480 --> 00:30.610
MOHAN:
Yes. This book was written

00:30.610 --> 00:33.650
more than a 100 years
before Hippocrates,

00:33.650 --> 00:35.410
the father of modern medicine.

00:35.410 --> 00:37.160
Incredible.

00:37.160 --> 00:39.660
There is information
about science,

00:39.660 --> 00:41.540
technology, and medicine

00:41.540 --> 00:43.870
preserved in ancient India.

00:43.870 --> 00:47.250
Where did the ancestors
receive this information?

00:47.250 --> 00:50.340
Aliens.
People from other planet.

00:50.340 --> 00:52.260
♪ ♪

01:20.120 --> 01:21.830
NARRATOR:
India.

01:21.830 --> 01:25.210
Home to over 1.3 billion people.

01:25.210 --> 01:28.540
It is the second most populous
nation in the world.

01:28.540 --> 01:30.750
Although it is home

01:30.750 --> 01:33.590
to some of mankind's
oldest civilizations,

01:33.590 --> 01:37.050
India has, in recent years,

01:37.050 --> 01:40.390
also undergone
rapid modernization.

01:40.390 --> 01:43.770
The city of Bangalore,
for example,

01:43.770 --> 01:45.930
is the headquarters
of literally thousands

01:45.930 --> 01:48.730
of information technology
companies,

01:48.730 --> 01:51.980
and has been ranked as
one of the most high‐tech cities

01:51.980 --> 01:54.400
in the world.

01:54.400 --> 01:57.570
But these advancements
also coexist

01:57.570 --> 02:00.570
with the country's
ancient origins.

02:00.570 --> 02:04.160
Roughly 80%
of the Indian population

02:04.160 --> 02:06.960
practices Hinduism.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.540
And for the Hindu faithful,

02:09.540 --> 02:12.920
their gods are not
mythological creatures,

02:12.920 --> 02:15.090
but are real
flesh‐and‐blood beings

02:15.090 --> 02:18.470
that have, at times,
been present here on Earth.

02:18.470 --> 02:20.340
For the Indian people,

02:20.340 --> 02:23.640
the basis of their religion
is essential

02:23.640 --> 02:27.020
to the fabric of their lives.

02:27.020 --> 02:30.690
JONATHAN YOUNG: Many
of the faithful, to this day,

02:30.690 --> 02:33.900
see these accounts
not as fanciful, but as history.

02:33.900 --> 02:35.820
They take it literally

02:35.820 --> 02:37.940
that the gods
walked among human beings

02:37.940 --> 02:39.990
and conveyed knowledge.

02:39.990 --> 02:41.780
MOHAN:
In the Hindu tradition,

02:41.780 --> 02:44.200
these ancient gods
are not considered

02:44.200 --> 02:46.660
just symbolic
or mythical beings.

02:46.660 --> 02:50.170
They are considered
as flesh‐and‐blood beings

02:50.170 --> 02:53.840
that came down from the sky
and existed in real life.

02:55.880 --> 02:58.050
NARRATOR:
The foundation of Hinduism

02:58.050 --> 03:01.720
is carefully preserved
in India's most ancient texts.

03:01.720 --> 03:03.850
And according
to their traditions,

03:03.850 --> 03:05.760
these texts are accounts

03:05.760 --> 03:08.640
given directly
by the gods themselves,

03:08.640 --> 03:12.020
and only transcribed by humans.

03:12.020 --> 03:14.770
This collection
includes the <i>Vedas,</i>

03:14.770 --> 03:16.440
or Hindu scriptures,

03:16.440 --> 03:18.570
as well as other manuscripts

03:18.570 --> 03:21.320
written in the early
Sanskrit language.

03:21.320 --> 03:23.820
Vedic scholars suggest knowledge

03:23.820 --> 03:26.990
pertaining to architecture,
science,

03:26.990 --> 03:30.710
technology, weaponry,
and medicine

03:30.710 --> 03:34.630
are preserved in meticulous
detail in these works.

03:34.630 --> 03:36.840
DEEPAK SHIMKHADA:
The origins of the Vedic text

03:36.840 --> 03:39.670
goes back to cosmic time.

03:39.670 --> 03:41.260
They have been around

03:41.260 --> 03:44.340
for thousands of thousands
of years.

03:44.340 --> 03:47.260
It is believed
that the knowledge

03:47.260 --> 03:50.060
came directly from gods.

03:50.060 --> 03:52.690
DAVID WILCOCK: We are seeing
a handbook of the gods.

03:52.690 --> 03:56.650
We are looking at an endowment
from some superior intelligence

03:56.650 --> 03:59.990
that appears to have been given
to us as a very practical guide

03:59.990 --> 04:02.110
in ways that benefit humankind

04:02.110 --> 04:04.870
all across the board.

04:04.870 --> 04:08.290
NARRATOR: But if the ancient
texts of India

04:08.290 --> 04:11.620
are truly attributable
to the extraterrestrial gods,

04:11.620 --> 04:14.830
just what information
do they contain?

04:20.460 --> 04:22.880
Sirpur, India.

04:22.880 --> 04:25.680
The Surang Tila Temple.

04:25.680 --> 04:27.680
This structure,

04:27.680 --> 04:30.850
which dates back
to the seventh century AD,

04:30.850 --> 04:33.480
was recently unearthed
after being buried

04:33.480 --> 04:35.400
by a powerful earthquake

04:35.400 --> 04:37.860
that occurred
in the 11th century.

04:37.860 --> 04:40.360
Although the rest of the area

04:40.360 --> 04:41.820
was completely leveled,

04:41.820 --> 04:43.650
the structure itself

04:43.650 --> 04:46.820
remained largely intact.

04:46.820 --> 04:49.370
Archaeologists suggest

04:49.370 --> 04:52.500
that this is due to the advanced
construction techniques,

04:52.500 --> 04:55.830
known as Ayurvedic
or Vedic architecture,

04:55.830 --> 04:58.670
utilized by its builders.

04:58.670 --> 05:01.630
The principles they used
are derived

05:01.630 --> 05:03.970
from the ancient science
of design

05:03.970 --> 05:07.390
that can be traced back
to the ancient Indian texts.

05:09.470 --> 05:11.930
In March 2017,

05:11.930 --> 05:15.560
researcher and ancient astronaut
theorist Giorgio Tsoukalos

05:15.560 --> 05:17.770
traveled to India

05:17.770 --> 05:20.860
to meet with archaeologist
Dr. Arun Sharma,

05:20.860 --> 05:22.530
who headed the dig.

05:22.530 --> 05:25.030
This is beautiful.

05:32.160 --> 05:33.660
Mm‐hmm.

05:43.260 --> 05:44.550
Really?

05:44.550 --> 05:46.420
Now, is this considered

05:46.420 --> 05:48.050
Ayurvedic architecture,
right here?

06:01.770 --> 06:04.070
That's amazing. Huh.

06:07.150 --> 06:08.660
Okay.

06:08.660 --> 06:11.280
NARRATOR:
Although much of the site

06:11.280 --> 06:14.370
has been renovated
using modern concrete,

06:14.370 --> 06:17.000
blocks held together
by the Ayurvedic paste

06:17.000 --> 06:18.830
can still be found.

06:26.590 --> 06:29.300
It seems to be almost like a...
s‐some type of glue.

06:44.900 --> 06:47.280
NARRATOR:
The glue‐like substance

06:47.280 --> 06:49.570
is said to form a bond

06:49.570 --> 06:53.120
that is at least 20 times
stronger than concrete.

06:53.120 --> 06:55.290
But modern builders
have been unwilling

06:55.290 --> 06:58.660
to entertain the notion
that such an ancient concoction

06:58.660 --> 07:01.880
could be superior
to today's building materials.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.500
Wow, look at this.

07:03.500 --> 07:05.000
Beautiful.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.630
NARRATOR:
The detailed instructions

07:06.630 --> 07:08.550
for making this paste
can be found

07:08.550 --> 07:10.220
in an ancient Indian text

07:10.220 --> 07:13.180
known as the <i>Mayamatam‐‐</i>

07:13.180 --> 07:17.020
a manuscript dedicated
to construction techniques.

07:17.020 --> 07:19.890
The information
contained within the document

07:19.890 --> 07:22.770
is understood to have been
passed down to humans

07:22.770 --> 07:24.560
from Mayasura,

07:24.560 --> 07:27.190
the ancient king
of the demigods,

07:27.190 --> 07:28.940
who was said to oversee

07:28.940 --> 07:31.530
various construction projects
on Earth,

07:31.530 --> 07:34.070
including cities in the sky.

07:43.540 --> 07:45.380
This, right here?

07:45.380 --> 07:47.170
NARRATOR: Curiously,
there is a more astounding

07:47.170 --> 07:50.010
earthquake‐proof feature
at the site

07:50.010 --> 07:52.130
which indicates
that advanced knowledge

07:52.130 --> 07:55.430
was used in its construction.

07:55.430 --> 07:59.350
Located at key points
within the Surang Tila Temple

07:59.350 --> 08:02.270
are several 80‐foot long shafts

08:02.270 --> 08:04.810
designed to form air pockets

08:04.810 --> 08:07.900
that can dissipate the impact
of seismic events.

08:13.200 --> 08:15.280
Yes, please.

08:16.320 --> 08:17.990
All right.

08:17.990 --> 08:20.040
Wow.

08:20.040 --> 08:21.540
Oh, wow, this is big.

08:21.540 --> 08:23.210
It's a huge book.

08:23.210 --> 08:25.210
And‐and this text
has been around

08:25.210 --> 08:28.040
for 4,500 years?

08:34.010 --> 08:36.760
In your opinion, where
did this knowledge come from?

08:40.930 --> 08:41.850
Uh‐huh.

08:48.730 --> 08:51.360
And you think
that this knowledge

08:51.360 --> 08:53.820
originated from the stars?

08:57.910 --> 09:00.200
That's amazing.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.080
NARRATOR:
According to the Hindu faithful,

09:02.080 --> 09:03.910
the construction techniques used

09:03.910 --> 09:05.790
at the Surang Tila Temple

09:05.790 --> 09:09.090
are just one example
of advanced technology

09:09.090 --> 09:12.550
detailed in the ancient
Sanskrit texts.

09:12.550 --> 09:15.340
Other works are said
to contain information

09:15.340 --> 09:19.100
far beyond the scope
of early man‐‐

09:19.100 --> 09:22.770
perhaps even providing
concrete proof

09:22.770 --> 09:25.940
of extraterrestrial activity
on Earth.

09:31.520 --> 09:32.980
Coming up...
NARRATOR:
The Indus Valley.

09:32.980 --> 09:35.240
Northwest India and Pakistan.

09:35.240 --> 09:38.870
June 2011.

09:38.870 --> 09:42.830
Paleontologists discover
a 4,300‐year‐old skull

09:42.830 --> 09:46.080
featuring multiple
drilled holes in it.

09:46.080 --> 09:49.670
Remarkably, they conclude

09:49.670 --> 09:53.380
these are signs that
brain surgery was performed.

09:53.380 --> 09:57.300
And it even appears that
the operation was successful,

09:57.300 --> 10:00.100
as the wound showed signs
of advanced healing.

10:02.470 --> 10:04.560
NOORY: In ancient India,
they performed

10:04.560 --> 10:07.810
incredible kinds of medicine

10:07.810 --> 10:10.860
and surgical procedures
on people.

10:10.860 --> 10:13.940
Things like
operating on the skull.

10:13.940 --> 10:16.030
What's fascinating
about this is...

10:16.030 --> 10:18.660
is this kind
of advanced medical knowledge

10:18.660 --> 10:21.570
goes way back, way back.

10:21.570 --> 10:23.910
And they were able
to use those techniques

10:23.910 --> 10:25.790
to heal people.

10:28.580 --> 10:31.540
NARRATOR: Vedic scholars
suggest that not only

10:31.540 --> 10:35.000
were the ancient Hindus
able to perform brain surgery,

10:35.000 --> 10:38.720
but other
advanced procedures as well.

10:38.720 --> 10:40.970
And much of this
medical knowledge

10:40.970 --> 10:43.640
was set to record
in a Sanskrit text

10:43.640 --> 10:46.850
dating back to 800 BC,

10:46.850 --> 10:49.140
known as the <i>Sushruta Samhita.</i>

10:51.310 --> 10:55.070
In 2017 at a local library

10:55.070 --> 10:57.070
in Mahabalipuram, India,

10:57.070 --> 10:59.150
Giorgio Tsoukalos

10:59.150 --> 11:01.530
meets with fellow
ancient astronaut theorist

11:01.530 --> 11:06.040
Praveen Mohan to take
a closer look at the text.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.830
Now this is a, uh,
vast medical text

11:08.830 --> 11:11.210
that contains information

11:11.210 --> 11:16.420
about more than
11,000 illnesses.

11:16.420 --> 11:19.340
Uh, it talks about
700 medicinal plants,

11:19.340 --> 11:23.930
64 preparations
from mineral resources,

11:23.930 --> 11:26.970
57 preparations
from animal resources,

11:26.970 --> 11:29.270
and it's considered the
foundation of Ayurveda,

11:29.270 --> 11:31.390
the traditional Indian medicine.

11:31.390 --> 11:33.020
Oh, so this is the basis

11:33.020 --> 11:35.770
‐for Ayurvedic medicine
right here. ‐Yes, yes.

11:35.770 --> 11:38.820
I was able to find a passage.
I thought you might find it,

11:38.820 --> 11:40.070
‐you know, interesting.
‐Mm‐hmm.

11:40.070 --> 11:41.650
Right here.

11:41.650 --> 11:43.780
Now you can see where it says

11:43.780 --> 11:46.910
that surgical operations
are of eight types.

11:46.910 --> 11:49.580
They are incising,

11:49.580 --> 11:54.000
excising, scraping, puncturing,

11:54.000 --> 11:57.300
probing, extracting,

11:57.300 --> 12:00.970
secreting fluids,
and even suturing.

12:00.970 --> 12:04.760
‐So imagine, we had suturing
2,600 years ago. ‐Mm‐hmm.

12:04.760 --> 12:06.930
And this book was written

12:06.930 --> 12:10.100
more than a hundred years
before Hippocrates,

12:10.100 --> 12:12.520
the father of modern medicine.

12:12.520 --> 12:15.770
That is amazing. And how was
this information obtained?

12:15.770 --> 12:17.980
Like, what's the story
behind this?

12:17.980 --> 12:20.820
Well, the title Sushruta Samhita

12:20.820 --> 12:23.780
means that the author Sushruta

12:23.780 --> 12:25.950
is not really the author.

12:25.950 --> 12:28.120
He did not write this book.

12:28.120 --> 12:33.080
He got this information from
a character called Dhanvantari,

12:33.080 --> 12:36.460
who was an otherworldly being.

12:36.460 --> 12:39.420
NARRATOR:
Dhanvantari is believed

12:39.420 --> 12:41.630
to be the physician to the gods

12:41.630 --> 12:45.390
and the father
of Ayurvedic medicine.

12:45.390 --> 12:48.180
SHIMKHADA: Dhanvantari himself
has a divine origin

12:48.180 --> 12:50.770
associated with the churning
of the milky ocean.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.520
The churning of the milk of sea

12:53.520 --> 12:56.940
refers to, perhaps, uh,
the Milky Way.

12:56.940 --> 12:59.360
Dhanvantari came out of that

12:59.360 --> 13:02.280
and then he was
the god of medicine.

13:02.280 --> 13:04.990
And he, then, gave this
knowledge of medicine

13:04.990 --> 13:07.570
to human beings.

13:07.570 --> 13:09.410
TSOUKALOS:
Dhanvantari was said

13:09.410 --> 13:12.370
to have originated
from the Milky Way.

13:12.370 --> 13:15.330
And so, all of a sudden,
you have a connection

13:15.330 --> 13:17.920
with this deity arriving
from the Milky Way.

13:17.920 --> 13:20.210
Well, what more do you want?

13:20.210 --> 13:22.170
The knowledge contained
in this document,

13:22.170 --> 13:26.840
known as the Sushruta Samhita,
was brought here

13:26.840 --> 13:29.390
by an extraterrestrial visitor.

13:29.390 --> 13:33.350
NARRATOR:
Ayurvedic medicine is considered

13:33.350 --> 13:38.150
one of the world's oldest and
most detailed healing sciences.

13:38.150 --> 13:41.770
Is it possible that it was
really handed down to mankind

13:41.770 --> 13:44.240
by alien sources?

13:44.240 --> 13:47.570
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

13:47.570 --> 13:51.200
and suggest that other texts
clearly reveal

13:51.200 --> 13:54.450
this extraterrestrial
connection.

13:57.420 --> 14:00.330
Mumbai University.

14:00.330 --> 14:02.340
Kalina, India.

14:02.340 --> 14:05.130
January 2015.

14:05.130 --> 14:08.800
The Indian Science Congress

14:08.800 --> 14:12.140
presents talks on various
technical disciplines

14:12.140 --> 14:16.890
to an audience of some of
India's top engineers.

14:16.890 --> 14:20.610
Included in the list
of presentations

14:20.610 --> 14:24.900
is a lecture on "Ancient Indian
Aviation Technology"

14:24.900 --> 14:28.320
given by retired pilot
and flight instructor

14:28.320 --> 14:31.870
Captain Anand J. Bodas.

14:31.870 --> 14:36.500
In his lecture, Captain Anand
Bodas told young engineers

14:36.500 --> 14:41.250
that they should recreate what
is given in ancient Vedic texts,

14:41.250 --> 14:45.130
because in the field
of aviation,

14:45.130 --> 14:48.510
there are much more
advanced devices mentioned

14:48.510 --> 14:51.550
than what we have today.

14:51.550 --> 14:53.720
NOORY: This was a very
controversial talk

14:53.720 --> 14:55.600
because you had one camp
that thought

14:55.600 --> 14:58.310
that the ancient civilizations
of India

14:58.310 --> 15:00.440
possessed incredible
flying technology,

15:00.440 --> 15:02.650
yet you then had that other camp

15:02.650 --> 15:04.770
that said this is crazy,
it's nonsense.

15:07.150 --> 15:09.200
But something was going on

15:09.200 --> 15:13.030
many, many, many, many thousands
of years ago,

15:13.030 --> 15:15.790
and they presented evidence
and documented facts

15:15.790 --> 15:17.950
that they had flying machines

15:17.950 --> 15:20.750
that were capable of doing
incredible things.

15:20.750 --> 15:22.580
How did they know this?

15:26.500 --> 15:29.300
NARRATOR: Captain Bodas
is just the latest

15:29.300 --> 15:32.220
in a long line
of researchers to suggest

15:32.220 --> 15:35.810
that the ancient texts
contained actual information

15:35.810 --> 15:39.600
about lost technology
pertaining to aerial vehicles,

15:39.600 --> 15:42.980
often referred to in the texts
as "vimanas."

15:45.230 --> 15:50.280
In 1895, a full
eight years before

15:50.280 --> 15:53.870
the Wright Brothers successfully
launched their flying machine,

15:53.870 --> 15:56.200
Sanskrit scholar Shivkar Talpade

15:56.200 --> 16:00.540
tested an aircraft he fashioned
based solely on information

16:00.540 --> 16:03.620
gleaned from
the ancient Indian writings.

16:03.620 --> 16:05.840
JOHN BRANDENBURG:
Talpade, in India,

16:05.840 --> 16:08.670
was a student of
the Vedic scriptures.

16:08.670 --> 16:11.630
And he decided to try
and construct

16:11.630 --> 16:14.590
one of the vimana flying craft

16:14.590 --> 16:18.180
that were seen in the, um,
Vedic scriptures.

16:18.180 --> 16:22.520
MOHAN:
The first aircraft of Talpade

16:22.520 --> 16:24.020
was called, "Marutsakha,"

16:24.020 --> 16:27.190
which means,
"friend of the wind."

16:27.190 --> 16:30.480
He was able to fly this aircraft

16:30.480 --> 16:34.860
in front of thousands of people
in Mumbai Beach.

16:34.860 --> 16:36.910
TAYLOR: The legend has it
that he flew for,

16:36.910 --> 16:39.410
like, 30 seconds at 1,500 feet.

16:39.410 --> 16:43.540
The Wright brothers only went
120 feet for 12 seconds.

16:43.540 --> 16:48.340
If this is true, that changes
aviation history dramatically.

16:48.340 --> 16:52.260
But even more exciting
is that he based his design

16:52.260 --> 16:54.970
on something written
thousands of years

16:54.970 --> 16:59.220
before mankind even thought
flying was possible.

16:59.220 --> 17:04.440
NARRATOR:
In 2017, Kavya Vaddadi,

17:04.440 --> 17:07.650
an aircraft design engineer
in Delhi, India,

17:07.650 --> 17:10.780
was able to re‐create
the <i>Marutsakha</i>

17:10.780 --> 17:15.110
as a digital 3D model utilizing
the same information contained

17:15.110 --> 17:18.370
in the texts
that Talpade studied.

17:18.370 --> 17:21.990
She shared her digital file

17:21.990 --> 17:24.580
with aerospace systems engineer
Travis Taylor,

17:24.580 --> 17:27.540
so he could 3D print it
in order to test

17:27.540 --> 17:31.460
its aerodynamic properties
in a wind tunnel.

17:31.460 --> 17:33.670
But just how would
this ancient design hold up

17:33.670 --> 17:35.970
when put to the test?

17:41.260 --> 17:43.270
NARRATOR: University of
California at Irvine.

17:43.270 --> 17:46.270
April 2017.

17:49.360 --> 17:52.480
Aerospace engineer Travis Taylor

17:52.480 --> 17:54.110
has obtained a model
of an aircraft

17:54.110 --> 17:57.240
whose design specifications
are based solely

17:57.240 --> 17:58.820
on information gleaned

17:58.820 --> 18:01.490
from ancient Indian texts
that are believed

18:01.490 --> 18:06.460
to have been formally set
to writing in 500 BC.

18:06.460 --> 18:10.840
He is going to subject it
to wind tunnel analysis

18:10.840 --> 18:13.750
to determine if it is
a viable flying machine.

18:16.420 --> 18:19.970
So explain to me what we've set
up here with that wind tunnel.

18:19.970 --> 18:23.260
Okay, so this is our
aerospace vehicle model.

18:23.260 --> 18:25.020
It's connected to this boom.

18:25.020 --> 18:27.140
The armature has
a force gauge on it.

18:27.140 --> 18:28.890
But we're gonna have airflow
go past it

18:28.890 --> 18:30.940
‐at about 50 miles per hour
or so. ‐Okay.

18:30.940 --> 18:33.900
And then we're gonna measure
forces against it

18:33.900 --> 18:36.780
to determine if, uh,
if it's gonna fly or not.

18:36.780 --> 18:40.280
And so, what are the signs
that you're looking for

18:40.280 --> 18:42.530
in order to determine
whether this is,

18:42.530 --> 18:44.790
‐in fact, aerodynamically sound?
‐Right.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.540
So we're gonna measure
the, uh, normal force.

18:47.540 --> 18:49.540
And the normal force
is up or down.

18:49.540 --> 18:52.040
Uh, if it starts to move up,
then that'll be exciting,

18:52.040 --> 18:54.250
because it's actually
going to be rising

18:54.250 --> 18:56.170
and that's how you get flight.
You know, when the airplane

18:56.170 --> 18:58.300
turns up, and it starts to move,
it's because it's getting lift.

18:58.300 --> 18:59.840
Uh, the other thing is,
I don't want to see it

18:59.840 --> 19:01.890
going real bad side to side,

19:01.890 --> 19:03.930
or real bad chatter up and down,

19:03.930 --> 19:05.390
because that would mean
it's unstable.

19:05.390 --> 19:06.930
All right. Well, let's do it.

19:06.930 --> 19:08.020
Let's fire her up
and see what happens.

19:08.020 --> 19:09.060
Yeah, let's do it.

19:11.520 --> 19:13.520
(whirring)

19:16.820 --> 19:18.570
‐The flow's coming up to speed.
‐Yep.

19:20.610 --> 19:24.030
NARRATOR: While being subjected
to 50‐mile‐an‐hour winds,

19:24.030 --> 19:26.450
the craft exhibits
a slight lift upwards

19:26.450 --> 19:28.370
yet remains relatively steady.

19:28.370 --> 19:29.750
TAYLOR:
No side‐to‐side wobble.

19:29.750 --> 19:33.080
Okay.

19:33.080 --> 19:36.170
NARRATOR: Sensors record the
measurements of various forces,

19:36.170 --> 19:39.420
as well as torque and pitch,
to determine

19:39.420 --> 19:42.760
just how aerodynamic
the body is.

19:42.760 --> 19:45.970
It looks very stable.

19:51.390 --> 19:52.650
All right.

19:52.650 --> 19:54.900
So let's look at the results.

19:54.900 --> 19:58.440
So what happened during the test
was the normal force,

19:58.440 --> 20:01.320
which is where
we measure the lift,

20:01.320 --> 20:04.990
it was positive between .03
and .06 pounds of force.

20:04.990 --> 20:07.490
‐That means we <i>were</i>
measuring lift. ‐Okay.

20:07.490 --> 20:10.910
So our vehicle
in the wind tunnel experiment

20:10.910 --> 20:14.290
was showing positive lift
like an aircraft would.

20:14.290 --> 20:18.420
Did you expect these results
from a shape that's like that?

20:18.420 --> 20:21.090
Well, the shape looks like
a lifting body to me.

20:21.090 --> 20:23.300
But you never know until you
actually do the experiment.

20:23.300 --> 20:26.100
And we have experimental results
now that says it is.

20:26.100 --> 20:28.260
So that's the exciting part.

20:28.260 --> 20:31.390
And‐and what do you say
to anyone who questions

20:31.390 --> 20:34.520
the idea that this information
has been taken

20:34.520 --> 20:37.860
from a text that's at least
1,800 years old?

20:37.860 --> 20:40.650
The only thing you can say is

20:40.650 --> 20:44.200
we performed a good
scientific experiment.

20:44.200 --> 20:46.280
And the results were

20:46.280 --> 20:49.540
that the shape
made from those texts

20:49.540 --> 20:51.660
is a viable
aerodynamic structure.

20:54.170 --> 20:56.670
NARRATOR:
The aircraft model created

20:56.670 --> 20:59.040
using details garnered from
the ancient Indian texts

20:59.040 --> 21:02.260
has proven to be flight‐worthy.

21:02.260 --> 21:07.300
Is it possible that, by studying
the ancient Indian texts,

21:07.300 --> 21:10.720
we may be able to recreate
advanced technology

21:10.720 --> 21:15.640
that existed thousands
of years ago in India?

21:15.640 --> 21:18.310
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest

21:18.310 --> 21:21.230
that the texts
may also contain details

21:21.230 --> 21:24.360
for advanced spacecraft.

21:28.780 --> 21:31.910
Hindu scholars point out
that stories of space travel

21:31.910 --> 21:34.370
can be found
throughout the pages

21:34.370 --> 21:36.540
of the ancient Sanskrit texts.

21:36.540 --> 21:39.540
There are even detailed accounts

21:39.540 --> 21:41.960
of humans entering flying crafts

21:41.960 --> 21:45.550
and being transported
to other solar systems.

21:45.550 --> 21:49.260
MOHAN: In the ancient text
of <i>Vishnu Purana,</i>

21:49.260 --> 21:52.640
Lord Vishnu decides
to take Dhruva,

21:52.640 --> 21:54.430
a human being,

21:54.430 --> 21:57.810
through an interstellar journey.

21:57.810 --> 22:01.110
We know this because
it is specifically stated

22:01.110 --> 22:03.570
that Dhruva
would be taken beyond

22:03.570 --> 22:05.570
planets like Mercury, Venus,

22:05.570 --> 22:09.660
and even beyond
some other stars.

22:09.660 --> 22:10.990
DAVID CHILDRESS:
According to the text,

22:10.990 --> 22:14.410
he went past
seven planetary systems

22:14.410 --> 22:16.410
in a physical craft,

22:16.410 --> 22:19.170
and eventually
he reached the solar system

22:19.170 --> 22:21.840
and planet of Vishnu Loka,

22:21.840 --> 22:26.300
the planet that Vishnu
is said to have come from.

22:26.300 --> 22:29.760
So here we have the story
of extraterrestrials taking

22:29.760 --> 22:32.180
a human to another solar system.

22:35.430 --> 22:37.640
NARRATOR:
Although few details exist

22:37.640 --> 22:40.190
of the craft Dhruva
was transported in,

22:40.190 --> 22:43.980
scholars have noted that
highly specific descriptions

22:43.980 --> 22:48.320
of space vehicles can be found
throughout the texts.

22:48.320 --> 22:50.870
In 2014,

22:50.870 --> 22:53.410
in an article
in the <i>Journal of Engineering</i>

22:53.410 --> 22:55.120
<i>and Innovative Technology</i>

22:55.120 --> 22:57.660
titled "Vedic Ion Engine,"

22:57.660 --> 23:01.580
a team of aerospace scientists
posed the theory

23:01.580 --> 23:05.090
that what is being described
in a 1,000‐year‐old text

23:05.090 --> 23:07.720
called
the <i>Samarangana Sutradhara</i>

23:07.720 --> 23:10.800
is a modern ion
mercury vortex engine

23:10.800 --> 23:14.390
used for space travel.

23:14.390 --> 23:17.060
TAYLOR: In the <i>Samarangana</i>
<i>Sutradhara</i> text,

23:17.060 --> 23:20.310
there's a description
of an engine that uses mercury,

23:20.310 --> 23:22.940
and the mercury swirls
in a vortex

23:22.940 --> 23:25.730
and it uses the heat
from, perhaps, solar power

23:25.730 --> 23:29.820
to create some type
of flying capability.

23:29.820 --> 23:35.200
My thought on this is it sounds
a lot like an ion engine.

23:35.200 --> 23:37.700
MARC RAYMAN: The concept for ion
engines has actually been around

23:37.700 --> 23:39.080
for more than 100 years.

23:39.080 --> 23:41.580
Now, the way it works
is xenon gas,

23:41.580 --> 23:43.960
which is like helium or neon
but heavier,

23:43.960 --> 23:46.170
is introduced
into a chamber here.

23:46.170 --> 23:48.800
And it's ionized, which means
it's given an electric charge.

23:48.800 --> 23:51.800
And once it has
an electric charge, a voltage

23:51.800 --> 23:55.050
applied between this grid
and one just behind it

23:55.050 --> 23:58.020
causes the xenon to shoot out
of the engine.

23:58.020 --> 24:01.390
Well, the action of the xenon
going out this direction

24:01.390 --> 24:03.650
causes a reaction
that pushes the spacecraft

24:03.650 --> 24:05.900
in the other direction.

24:05.900 --> 24:08.940
And that's how the ion thruster
propels the spacecraft.

24:08.940 --> 24:11.780
You heat the ions up,

24:11.780 --> 24:15.450
and then you accelerate them out
the back end of the spacecraft.

24:15.450 --> 24:17.330
It puts out
a small amount of thrust,

24:17.330 --> 24:19.330
but for a very long time.

24:19.330 --> 24:22.500
And that's why ion engines
are uniquely perfect

24:22.500 --> 24:24.670
for interspace travel.

24:30.130 --> 24:31.880
NARRATOR:
In 2007,

24:31.880 --> 24:34.430
NASA launched
the Dawn spacecraft,

24:34.430 --> 24:38.260
which used a conventional
multistage chemical rocket

24:38.260 --> 24:41.060
to blast off from Earth,

24:41.060 --> 24:42.810
but then switched
to an ion engine

24:42.810 --> 24:46.940
for its journey
through deep space.

24:46.940 --> 24:49.820
Crucial to that mission
was an ion thruster.

24:49.820 --> 24:53.820
And it gets its energy
from solar panels.

24:53.820 --> 24:58.160
So here you have
this solar‐powered ion thruster

24:58.160 --> 25:00.450
with this vortex
in the middle of it going out

25:00.450 --> 25:01.950
to the asteroid belt,

25:01.950 --> 25:06.000
and it's described
in Sanskrit texts.

25:09.460 --> 25:11.460
NARRATOR:
If information detailing

25:11.460 --> 25:14.680
previously lost technology
was purposely left

25:14.680 --> 25:17.010
for humans to rediscover,

25:17.010 --> 25:22.390
are we now sufficiently advanced
to successfully replicate it?

25:22.390 --> 25:26.350
And if so, are there
any other developments beyond

25:26.350 --> 25:29.400
ancient space travel
that scientists have been able

25:29.400 --> 25:30.570

25:41.080 --> 25:44.960
NARRATOR:
Mahabalipuram, India.

25:44.960 --> 25:47.880
While at a local library

25:47.880 --> 25:51.840
with fellow ancient astronaut
theorist Praveen Mohan,

25:51.840 --> 25:55.720
Giorgio Tsoukalos gets
a firsthand look at early copies

25:55.720 --> 25:59.600
of some of India's most
important ancient texts.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.220
And now let me show you
the other book.

26:01.220 --> 26:03.640
This is the <i>Bhagavad Gita.</i>

26:03.640 --> 26:05.680
NARRATOR:
Among the most influential

26:05.680 --> 26:07.140
is the <i>Bhagavad Gita,</i>

26:07.140 --> 26:09.900
part of the 13,000‐page epic

26:09.900 --> 26:11.520
called the <i>Mahabharata,</i>

26:11.520 --> 26:14.690
which contains
19 individual books.

26:14.690 --> 26:19.740
Historians think this text
was written around 500 BC,

26:19.740 --> 26:22.450
so this book is 2,500 years old.

26:22.450 --> 26:26.000
‐Okay.
‐But according to "mythology,"

26:26.000 --> 26:29.540
this was supposed to be written
at least 10,000 years ago.

26:29.540 --> 26:31.630
(chuckling):
Okay.

26:31.630 --> 26:35.590
It's a very popular book,
and some people even say

26:35.590 --> 26:39.220
atomic science is hidden
in this book.

26:39.220 --> 26:43.850
Not just regular people,
but modern physicists.

26:43.850 --> 26:47.640
So the argument can be made
that the knowledge of,

26:47.640 --> 26:51.150
‐for example, the atom
is contained in a book ‐Mm‐hmm.

26:51.150 --> 26:55.070
‐Yes. ‐...that is at least
2,500 years old?

26:55.070 --> 26:57.690
And some stories say

26:57.690 --> 27:02.160
‐that it was given
by an otherworldly being. ‐Yes.

27:02.160 --> 27:04.240
‐Okay.
‐Even Robert Oppenheimer,

27:04.240 --> 27:06.120
who is the father
of atomic bomb,

27:06.120 --> 27:08.960
‐uh, was fascinated
by this book. ‐Mm‐hmm.

27:08.960 --> 27:11.210
‐Really? Wow.
‐Yes.

27:11.210 --> 27:12.960
TSOUKALOS:
Okay, that's interesting.

27:20.470 --> 27:23.260
NARRATOR: Jornada
del Muerto Desert, New Mexico.

27:23.260 --> 27:27.270
July 16, 1945.

27:27.270 --> 27:30.690
In the middle
of the barren Alamogordo Bombing

27:30.690 --> 27:32.940
and Gunnery Range,

27:32.940 --> 27:38.280
scientists detonate the first
man‐made nuclear weapon.

27:42.450 --> 27:47.080
The destruction was comparable
to no other weapon known to man.

27:49.200 --> 27:52.750
The father of the atomic bomb
was J. Robert Oppenheimer,

27:52.750 --> 27:55.790
the leader
of the Manhattan Project,

27:55.790 --> 27:58.590
a secret government program
created

27:58.590 --> 28:02.130
to develop such a weapon.

28:02.130 --> 28:05.510
Oppenheimer, when he saw
the successful nuclear test

28:05.510 --> 28:10.810
and realized what a terrible
weapon he was unleashing,

28:10.810 --> 28:13.350
he quoted the <i>Bhagavad Gita's</i>

28:13.350 --> 28:16.690
"I am become death,
the destroyer of worlds."

28:22.110 --> 28:25.820
NARRATOR: Oppenheimer's interest
in ancient Sanskrit literature

28:25.820 --> 28:27.870
began while he was a professor

28:27.870 --> 28:30.700
at the University of California,
Berkeley

28:30.700 --> 28:32.620
and was introduced to the texts

28:32.620 --> 28:36.460
by renowned scholar
Arthur W. Ryder.

28:36.460 --> 28:38.550
Under Ryder's tutelage,

28:38.550 --> 28:41.800
Oppenheimer extensively studied
the Vedic scriptures

28:41.800 --> 28:45.300
and became proficient
in Sanskrit.

28:45.300 --> 28:48.140
According to his biographers,

28:48.140 --> 28:52.680
he kept a hardcover of the
<i>Bhagavad Gita</i> on his bookshelf

28:52.680 --> 28:56.270
and was known to give copies
away to his friends as gifts.

28:56.270 --> 28:59.320
BRANDENBURG:
One of the ideas that's deep

28:59.320 --> 29:01.490
within the Vedic scriptures,
the <i>Bhagavad Gita,</i>

29:01.490 --> 29:04.240
is the idea of duty.

29:04.240 --> 29:06.780
He felt it was his duty
to do this,

29:06.780 --> 29:09.830
even though it would be
a terrible thing, he realized,

29:09.830 --> 29:12.700
to develop
this new nuclear weapon.

29:12.700 --> 29:16.960
So he believed
he was part of a cosmic cycle

29:16.960 --> 29:20.050
and we had to do this
to advance.

29:20.050 --> 29:24.970
Perhaps he knew that
by developing the atomic bomb,

29:24.970 --> 29:27.930
we were actually reconnecting
with technologies

29:27.930 --> 29:32.060
that we had been exposed to
many thousands of years before.

29:34.270 --> 29:37.440
NARRATOR: One of the key ideas
found within the Indian texts

29:37.440 --> 29:41.860
is the concept of the cyclical
nature of existence,

29:41.860 --> 29:44.610
that once we complete
a cosmic cycle,

29:44.610 --> 29:48.370
it just begins once more.

29:48.370 --> 29:51.160
Oppenheimer himself came to see

29:51.160 --> 29:55.580
that he was, in a sense,
fulfilling some ancient destiny

29:55.580 --> 29:58.130
and that this weapon
could ultimately be used

29:58.130 --> 30:01.040
to stop a major war,
which is exactly what happened.

30:01.040 --> 30:04.050
It totally broke the momentum
of World War II.

30:04.050 --> 30:07.180
In that sense, he was seeing
that he was, in some way,

30:07.180 --> 30:09.850
fulfilling a destiny
that came to him

30:09.850 --> 30:12.850
from a seemingly
supernatural source,

30:12.850 --> 30:17.810
i.e. extraterrestrial gods
who influenced ancient India.

30:17.810 --> 30:20.940
NARRATOR: If Oppenheimer's work
on the atomic bomb

30:20.940 --> 30:24.440
was inspired
by the ancient Indian texts,

30:24.440 --> 30:28.240
could this mean that similar
weapons actually existed

30:28.240 --> 30:32.120
on Earth thousands of years ago?

30:37.500 --> 30:39.290
Thar Desert.

30:39.290 --> 30:41.540
Rajasthan, India.

30:41.540 --> 30:44.130
1992.

30:44.130 --> 30:48.300
Engineers conducting
soil sampling at a site

30:48.300 --> 30:51.050
where a housing development
was to be built

30:51.050 --> 30:56.730
discover a heavy layer of
radioactive ash under the soil.

30:56.730 --> 31:01.400
Further examination reveals
the contamination stretches

31:01.400 --> 31:05.820
across a three‐square‐mile area
of the desert.

31:05.820 --> 31:08.240
MOHAN:
After cordoning off the area,

31:08.240 --> 31:11.660
scientists unearthed a city

31:11.660 --> 31:15.160
with completely demolished
buildings.

31:21.250 --> 31:25.000
HENRY: Scientists have
discovered a radioactive ash

31:25.000 --> 31:28.880
that they believe dates
to 8,000 to 12,000 years ago

31:28.880 --> 31:32.930
that shows evidence of a nuclear
blast in ancient times.

31:32.930 --> 31:37.140
This is very interesting
because the Sanskrit texts

31:37.140 --> 31:40.940
describe exactly this type
of occurrence in this era

31:40.940 --> 31:42.810
in ancient times.

31:44.820 --> 31:46.730
NARRATOR:
In the <i>Ramayana,</i>

31:46.730 --> 31:50.030
one of the major
ancient Sanskrit epics,

31:50.030 --> 31:53.410
a mighty weapon of the god
Brahma called the Brahmastra

31:53.410 --> 31:56.830
is described as a weapon
of immense power

31:56.830 --> 31:59.700
intended to rain down
destruction from above.

31:59.700 --> 32:04.000
Brahma provided this weapon
to the hero Rama

32:04.000 --> 32:08.340
as a last resort after all
conventional means of warfare

32:08.340 --> 32:11.380
failed in his battle
against the demon king.

32:13.390 --> 32:16.640
SHIMKHADA: The Brahmastra
is the deadliest weapon there is

32:16.640 --> 32:18.770
in the history of humankind.

32:18.770 --> 32:23.520
It is like a nuclear device,
uh, that can be detonated,

32:23.520 --> 32:27.150
and then it will have
a very devastating effect.

32:27.150 --> 32:32.150
Once it was fired, its effect
fell on a lot of animals,

32:32.150 --> 32:34.030
and then they dropped dead.

32:34.030 --> 32:37.080
And also, people started
losing their nails,

32:37.080 --> 32:40.080
their hair,
and they could not breathe.

32:40.080 --> 32:43.420
LAYNE LITTLE: Rama fires
the Brahmastra weapon

32:43.420 --> 32:46.080
upon Dhrumatulya.

32:46.080 --> 32:50.880
It is commonly accepted that
this is in Rajasthan,

32:50.880 --> 32:52.010
in Pakistan.

32:52.010 --> 32:56.220
It's the 19th‐largest desert

32:56.220 --> 32:58.100
in the world.

32:58.100 --> 33:00.640
NARRATOR: Does the layer
of radioactive ash,

33:00.640 --> 33:04.060
recently discovered
in the Thar Desert of Rajasthan,

33:04.060 --> 33:07.650
provide proof that
the stories recorded

33:07.650 --> 33:10.150
in the ancient scriptures
have merit?

33:14.030 --> 33:16.070
NARRATOR:
Nuclear warfare,

33:16.070 --> 33:20.740
space travel, flying craft...

33:20.740 --> 33:24.330
might there be greater truth
about our technological past

33:24.330 --> 33:27.710
revealed in the ancient
Indian texts?

33:27.710 --> 33:31.380
And if so,
are they simply a guide

33:31.380 --> 33:35.760
to move us forward,
as a warning

33:35.760 --> 33:38.510
for mankind's impending fate?

33:44.770 --> 33:46.770
NARRATOR:
Ranakpur, India.

33:46.770 --> 33:49.560
The Chaumukha Jain Temple.

33:49.560 --> 33:54.650
Built in the 15th century AD,
this place of worship

33:54.650 --> 33:59.320
is dedicated to the Jains' first
teacher god, Rishabhanatha,

33:59.320 --> 34:03.120
who is credited with the task
of civilizing human beings

34:03.120 --> 34:05.660
and teaching them writing,
mathematics,

34:05.660 --> 34:08.630
science and agriculture.

34:10.590 --> 34:13.260
Jainism is an ancient
Indian religion

34:13.260 --> 34:15.630
that predates Hinduism.

34:15.630 --> 34:19.680
Jains and Hindus hold
a similar belief system

34:19.680 --> 34:23.470
relating to the cyclical nature
of the Universe, karma,

34:23.470 --> 34:28.850
and reincarnation,
yet worship different gods.

34:28.850 --> 34:33.280
For Jains, the quest for
knowledge is essential

34:33.280 --> 34:36.030
for their spiritual liberation.

34:36.030 --> 34:39.990
And the iconography of the
temple is meant to symbolize

34:39.990 --> 34:44.660
Rishabhanatha's attainment
of cosmic enlightenment.

34:44.660 --> 34:46.540
MOHAN:
The most uncanny feature

34:46.540 --> 34:49.250
in the Temple of Ranakpur

34:49.250 --> 34:51.420
is not on the ground,
it's not on the walls,

34:51.420 --> 34:54.050
but it is on the ceiling.

34:57.470 --> 35:01.600
The ceiling is almost identical
to images

35:01.600 --> 35:04.640
of the Large Hadron Collider,

35:04.640 --> 35:09.770
a particle accelerator
in Switzerland.

35:13.730 --> 35:17.280
WILCOCK: If you look
at the carving on the ceiling,

35:17.280 --> 35:20.820
you're seeing something that has
a curious radial structure.

35:20.820 --> 35:23.580
It's circular.
There's bands within bands.

35:23.580 --> 35:25.290
And then you have
all of these lines that go

35:25.290 --> 35:27.080
towards the center.

35:27.080 --> 35:29.620
Now, there is a
more‐than‐passing similarity

35:29.620 --> 35:33.130
between the carving and what
we're actually seeing

35:33.130 --> 35:35.960
in the Large Hadron Collider.

35:38.590 --> 35:41.720
NARRATOR: The 17‐mile‐long
Large Hadron Collider,

35:41.720 --> 35:45.970
or LHC, is the world's largest
and most powerful

35:45.970 --> 35:49.100
particle accelerator.

35:49.100 --> 35:52.810
It was created to smash
tiny protons together

35:52.810 --> 35:57.570
at speeds of nearly
670 million miles per hour,

35:57.570 --> 36:01.530
roughly the speed of light.

36:01.530 --> 36:05.330
The total energy produced
by the collisions is believed

36:05.330 --> 36:08.620
to reproduce similar states
to those that existed

36:08.620 --> 36:10.960
moments after the Big Bang,

36:10.960 --> 36:15.420
the event that many scientists
believe was responsible

36:15.420 --> 36:17.550
for the creation of the cosmos.

36:19.710 --> 36:23.840
By examining these collisions,
scientists can attempt to answer

36:23.840 --> 36:27.350
the question of just how
the universe began.

36:29.430 --> 36:31.850
BRANDENBURG:
The Hadron supercollider:

36:31.850 --> 36:33.980
its purpose is to duplicate,
basically,

36:33.980 --> 36:36.110
conditions of the Big Bang,

36:36.110 --> 36:39.820
when the universe
was first created.

36:39.820 --> 36:43.910
But one of the concerns is
that since we're recreating

36:43.910 --> 36:48.790
conditions like the Big Bang at
the beginning of the universe,

36:48.790 --> 36:50.250
some of the things
running around

36:50.250 --> 36:51.870
at the beginning of the universe

36:51.870 --> 36:53.870
we don't want to encounter.

36:53.870 --> 36:57.000
And this is a very
difficult thing,

36:57.000 --> 36:59.210
to face so many unknowns.

37:04.260 --> 37:08.510
NARRATOR: Work on this subatomic
realm, or quantum mechanics,

37:08.510 --> 37:12.640
can be traced to two
scientific pioneers‐‐

37:12.640 --> 37:15.650
Austrian physicist
Erwin Schrodinger,

37:15.650 --> 37:19.520
and German physicist
Werner Heisenberg.

37:19.520 --> 37:23.820
According to biographers,
both Schrodinger and Heisenberg

37:23.820 --> 37:27.280
were highly influenced
by the ancient Indian texts.

37:27.280 --> 37:29.870
WILCOCK:
Heisenberg is on record saying

37:29.870 --> 37:33.250
quantum theory will not look
so unusual to anyone

37:33.250 --> 37:35.420
who is a student of the Vedanta,

37:35.420 --> 37:37.540
the Hindu sacred scriptures.

37:37.540 --> 37:39.960
Well, why would he say
something like that?

37:39.960 --> 37:42.340
The Hindus had
a very interesting way

37:42.340 --> 37:46.050
of looking at the world,
including this concept

37:46.050 --> 37:49.260
of a quantum reality through
what they call "trutis,"

37:49.260 --> 37:53.520
which appear to be magnificently
tiny particles that ultimately

37:53.520 --> 37:56.730
make up all of physical reality
as we know it.

37:56.730 --> 37:59.480
BRANDENBURG: It is fascinating
how these very old texts

37:59.480 --> 38:02.070
are still relevant today,

38:02.070 --> 38:05.360
and, in fact, may be largely
responsible for the progress

38:05.360 --> 38:07.990
in quantum mechanics
in the early 20th century.

38:10.160 --> 38:11.280
WILCOCK:
This suggests that the culture

38:11.280 --> 38:12.660
that wrote those texts

38:12.660 --> 38:15.870
had knowledge
of quantum mechanics.

38:15.870 --> 38:19.540
The Hindu texts
in some ways mirrors,

38:19.540 --> 38:23.590
or foreshadows,
things that will come later.

38:23.590 --> 38:27.760
Perhaps these people were being
guided by extraterrestrials

38:27.760 --> 38:30.390
to protect that knowledge,
so that in our time we would

38:30.390 --> 38:34.390
look back at that
and notice the similarity.

38:34.390 --> 38:36.810
And we have to look
at the possibility

38:36.810 --> 38:39.650
that this is an endowment
that has been given to us

38:39.650 --> 38:43.480
by these extraterrestrials
for a greater divine purpose.

38:45.690 --> 38:49.410
The texts could serve
as a window into our future,

38:49.410 --> 38:53.490
and a warning that if we don't
alter the course that we're on,

38:53.490 --> 38:55.500
it could be catastrophic.

38:58.040 --> 39:01.500
NARRATOR: If extraterrestrials
instructed our ancestors

39:01.500 --> 39:04.050
to record lost advanced
technological knowledge

39:04.050 --> 39:06.260
and principles,

39:06.260 --> 39:09.090
was it meant to serve
as a guidebook

39:09.090 --> 39:12.550
to our scientifically
enlightened age?

39:12.550 --> 39:15.470
Or might it, instead,
be a warning

39:15.470 --> 39:19.890
to prevent us from repeating
the mistakes of the past?

39:19.890 --> 39:23.230
If so, what do the texts say

39:23.230 --> 39:26.440
about where
mankind is headed next?

39:33.870 --> 39:35.540
NARRATOR:
New Delhi, India.

39:37.750 --> 39:40.870
Scholars at the National
Mission of Manuscripts

39:40.870 --> 39:43.330
set out to translate
and preserve

39:43.330 --> 39:45.960
what they estimate to be
over four million

39:45.960 --> 39:49.760
rare ancient texts related
to various disciplines,

39:49.760 --> 39:52.840
including ancient science.

39:52.840 --> 39:56.600
Many of these texts have been
preserved on palm leaves,

39:56.600 --> 39:59.600
and are believed to be scattered
in obscure locations

39:59.600 --> 40:01.640
throughout the subcontinent.

40:01.640 --> 40:05.730
Currently, less than ten percent
of the ancient writings

40:05.730 --> 40:07.980
of India have been published.

40:07.980 --> 40:10.570
And no one is certain
what secrets lie hidden

40:10.570 --> 40:13.620
in these remaining
undeciphered manuscripts.

40:15.490 --> 40:18.290
Is it possible that
the road map for our future

40:18.290 --> 40:20.910
is yet to be revealed
by studying

40:20.910 --> 40:23.670
these ancient Indian texts?

40:23.670 --> 40:26.750
BRANDENBURG:
These texts should be consulted

40:26.750 --> 40:31.510
as we evolve into a world that
is full of so many unknowns,

40:31.510 --> 40:36.140
and the Vedic scriptures are
a vast storehouse of knowledge.

40:36.140 --> 40:39.930
And by not consulting them,
who knows‐‐

40:39.930 --> 40:42.520
we may be missing
something vital.

40:44.350 --> 40:46.110
HENRY:
We would be well served

40:46.110 --> 40:49.610
to go back to the Hindu texts

40:49.610 --> 40:52.950
and recognize that perhaps
we've been here before.

40:52.950 --> 40:57.910
The Vedic text offers the key
to us to move forward.

40:57.910 --> 41:00.750
Conversely, it could well be
that ignoring it

41:00.750 --> 41:03.000
will be at our own peril,

41:03.000 --> 41:06.040
and that we could, in fact,
face our end.

41:06.040 --> 41:08.750
CHILDRESS: What I really think
is important here

41:08.750 --> 41:12.840
is that we pay more attention
to these ancient texts,

41:12.840 --> 41:15.220
and try to learn
what we can from them,

41:15.220 --> 41:17.970
because this is the gods,
the extraterrestrials,

41:17.970 --> 41:19.760
giving us this information.

41:22.980 --> 41:24.980
NARRATOR:
Do the voices of the gods,

41:24.980 --> 41:28.110
as written in the pages
of India's ancient texts,

41:28.110 --> 41:32.990
really contain information
left for us to discover,

41:32.990 --> 41:35.490
or do they convey knowledge

41:35.490 --> 41:38.700
that we were meant to avoid?

41:38.700 --> 41:40.540
For ancient astronaut theorists,

41:40.540 --> 41:42.410
one fact is certain‐‐

41:42.410 --> 41:45.750
that mankind's
extraterrestrial past

41:45.750 --> 41:50.340
provides the key
to its future.

41:50.340 --> 41:54.220
A future that will either see us
successfully avoid

41:54.220 --> 41:56.550
the mistakes of our ancestors,

41:56.550 --> 41:58.890
or warn us
of the deadly mistakes

41:58.890 --> 42:01.810
we are destined...

42:01.810 --> 42:07.600
to repeat.
