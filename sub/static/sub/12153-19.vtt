Listen. Please.
What did I do?

00:05.500 --> 00:07.300
Shh.

00:09.500 --> 00:12.900
No. No. Wait!

[Groaning]

00:36.500 --> 00:39.300
Find it. Find...

00:39.300 --> 00:44.100
Gunn. Charles Gunn.
You're... Fred?

00:44.100 --> 00:46.100
You look terrible.

00:47.400 --> 00:49.700
[Grunts]
Illyria.

00:50.700 --> 00:52.600
- Move.
- Can't.

00:52.600 --> 00:56.600
Can't leave this dimension unless someone
else puts on the necklace, takes my place.

01:07.900 --> 01:09.300
[Screams]

01:09.300 --> 01:11.700
<i>I didn't send her.</i>
<i>We were discussing Gunn.</i>

01:11.700 --> 01:15.200
I explained his situation,
our inability to get him out.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.700
She nodded, created a portal
and disappeared.

01:17.700 --> 01:20.800
So she's just, what, helping you out?
She's your little helper?

01:20.800 --> 01:23.900
- I would hardly call...
<i>- Well, she sure was helpful beatin'me up.</i>

01:23.900 --> 01:26.500
Wes, do you have any idea why
she's doing all this for you?

01:26.500 --> 01:28.900
Does it matter?
She may be able to get him out.

01:28.900 --> 01:31.500
Or she might get him killed.

01:31.500 --> 01:34.300
<i>It doesn't track, Wes.</i>
<i>Why would she take on any risk for us?</i>

01:34.300 --> 01:37.300
<i>I doubt this poses a risk to her.</i>
<i>She has the power of a god.</i>

01:37.300 --> 01:39.000
She has the ego of a god.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.600
She was ruler of the world, after all.
Sort of thing goes to one's head.

01:41.600 --> 01:44.800
- Apparently.
- I am making progress.

01:44.800 --> 01:49.500
There's distance, of course.
She would never accept any of us as peers.

01:49.500 --> 01:54.700
But I afford her some amusement at the
very least. It may be why she's still here.

01:54.700 --> 01:58.000
She's still here because this place reeks
of influence. She had everything, Wes.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.300
<i>Everything. You think she's not</i>
<i>looking to get that back?</i>

02:01.300 --> 02:04.100
I wouldn't presume to know
what she wants.

02:04.100 --> 02:06.400
<i>But I understand the resource...</i>

02:06.400 --> 02:08.800
the power she represents.

02:08.800 --> 02:12.500
If we could just find
some way to integrate her.

02:12.500 --> 02:15.700
<i>- To convince her to...</i>
- To do what? Join the team.

02:17.900 --> 02:20.400
- Gunn!
- Illyria.

02:23.100 --> 02:26.200
- [Groans]
<i>- This thing.</i>

02:26.200 --> 02:29.100
- Let him go.
- It's important to you.

02:29.100 --> 02:32.600
- Illyria, stop.
- It holds value. Worth beyond price.

02:32.600 --> 02:35.100
- I said, let him...
- Yes, great worth.

02:35.100 --> 02:38.600
A great debt.
You're talking of the debt, aren't you?

02:38.600 --> 02:40.900
<i>What we owe you.</i>

02:40.900 --> 02:44.100
- [Groans]
- Of what you owe me.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.900
Go, team.

03:40.700 --> 03:43.200
<i>[Chattering]</i>

04:01.700 --> 04:05.200
All pre-Christian works
dealing with the Demon Age.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.300
Same for Primordium.

04:07.300 --> 04:09.800
<i>Index any mention of the Old Ones.</i>

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
<i>Hey.</i>

04:19.000 --> 04:20.600
Gunn.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.700
- First day back?
- Yeah.

04:33.800 --> 04:36.200
I stabbed you.
I should apologize for that.

04:36.200 --> 04:41.200
But I'm honestly not sure how.
I think it'll just be awkward.

04:42.500 --> 04:45.400
- Good call.
- Okay.

04:45.400 --> 04:50.800
<i>I ain't lookin'for a "sorry."</i>
<i>Don't know if I'd accept it.</i>

04:50.800 --> 04:54.200
Besides, I just got my heart cut out of
my chest every day for two weeks straight.

04:54.200 --> 04:56.500
<i>Compared to what,</i>
<i>a littlejab in the gut?</i>

04:56.500 --> 04:58.300
Kinda over it.

04:58.300 --> 05:01.300
So, uh, what are you looking for?

05:03.900 --> 05:08.300
I don't know.
A compass maybe.

05:08.300 --> 05:13.900
The thing that killed my friend
just saved my life. No one knows why.

05:13.900 --> 05:16.700
This place just went
Poseidon on my ass.

05:16.700 --> 05:18.700
I don't know which way is up.

05:18.700 --> 05:21.600
Everything is...

05:21.600 --> 05:23.400
a bit odd.

05:25.600 --> 05:28.400
I suppose we have to adjust.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.400
I imagine that's what all this is.

05:30.400 --> 05:35.300
- Adjustment.
- Adjustment?

05:35.300 --> 05:39.100
To things. To myself.

05:39.100 --> 05:41.600
To this place.

05:41.600 --> 05:45.300
To Illyria.

05:45.300 --> 05:48.100
She definitely takes adjusting to.

05:48.100 --> 05:52.500
You can't look at her without seeing...

05:58.600 --> 06:02.600
her body's previous owner.
[Chuckles]

06:06.500 --> 06:09.600
<i>But then, what comes out ofher mouth...</i>

06:09.600 --> 06:13.100
pure, unadulterated vertigo.

06:13.100 --> 06:15.300
We look so tiny to her.

06:15.300 --> 06:17.600
But you got her on a leash
or something, right?

06:17.600 --> 06:22.800
No. [Chuckles] No.

06:22.800 --> 06:27.600
She is monumentally self-possessed.

06:29.200 --> 06:32.300
She still thinks she's
the god-king of the universe.

06:32.300 --> 06:34.200
So she's like a TV star.

06:34.200 --> 06:36.800
No. Nothing that bad.

06:38.100 --> 06:40.000
A bit more violent though.

06:41.900 --> 06:44.300
[Panting]
All right, Grandma.

06:45.400 --> 06:47.500
I'll give you that.
Good one.

06:55.700 --> 06:57.900
This shell.

06:59.600 --> 07:02.200
You had affection for it.
For Fred.

07:02.200 --> 07:04.500
Uh-huh. Tons.
Loved the bird.

07:04.500 --> 07:09.500
- Yet you strike at her form without sentiment.
- You ain't her.

07:09.500 --> 07:13.300
I can see it.
Lord knows, I can smell it.

07:13.300 --> 07:16.400
And I got no problem hitting it.

07:19.300 --> 07:22.100
- You are adapting.
- We do that.

07:22.100 --> 07:24.000
Adaptation is compromise.

07:25.700 --> 07:28.700
It's called learning. But then I guess
you know everything there is to know.

07:28.700 --> 07:33.000
When the world met me,
it shuddered, groaned.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.900
It knelt at my feet.

07:34.900 --> 07:38.400
"Dear Penthouse, I don't normally
write letters like this, but..."

07:40.400 --> 07:42.800
[Chuckles]

07:42.800 --> 07:46.300
- Illyria was all they needed to know.
- Then came the Internet.

07:48.700 --> 07:50.800
You have nothing.

07:50.800 --> 07:53.000
Your kind has pulled this domain apart.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.400
Each of you has snatched
a tiny piece of it.

07:56.400 --> 07:59.300
Even those with the mightiest
hordes are paupers.

07:59.300 --> 08:02.500
The one who dies with
the most toys wins, eh?

08:02.500 --> 08:06.500
<i>To never die and to conquer all...</i>
<i>that is winning.</i>

08:18.600 --> 08:20.600
Now, that's cheating.

08:23.700 --> 08:26.000
<i>[Angel]</i>
<i>Spike. Talk to you for a minute?</i>

08:30.700 --> 08:32.799
- You may go.
- [Chuckles]

08:32.799 --> 08:36.500
Yeah. Great.
Thanks so much.

08:40.799 --> 08:43.900
<i>That time-stop thing's a royal bitch.</i>

08:43.900 --> 08:46.200
But I'm starting to suss out
her million-year-old moves.

08:46.200 --> 08:48.900
Cheeky mix.
A little tae kwon do...

08:48.900 --> 08:51.600
a little Brazilian ninjitsu,
ancestrally speaking.

08:51.600 --> 08:55.400
- We have to stop these sessions.
- Hang on. Just now gettin' into it.

08:55.400 --> 08:57.800
Testing her has sharpened technique
I didn't even know was rusty.

08:57.800 --> 09:01.300
We're not testing her, Spike.
She's testing us.

09:01.300 --> 09:06.100
<i>- [Panting]</i>
<i>- [Spike] Got her winded at least, didn't I?</i>

09:06.100 --> 09:09.200
That's right, little Shiva.
Reckon you'll think twice next time.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.100
<i>[Knocking]</i>

09:29.100 --> 09:32.700
Hey. Shoulder to
the wheel already, huh?

09:32.700 --> 09:36.700
Got to start sometime.
That's what I keep telling myself anyway.

09:36.700 --> 09:39.300
So you good?
I mean, you look good, considering.

09:41.900 --> 09:44.700
I just thought I'd, uh, drop in to...

09:44.700 --> 09:46.800
to see if you were good,
which you are.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.800
[Clears Throat]
Good.

09:48.800 --> 09:50.900
What's, uh, with the incognito?

09:50.900 --> 09:52.900
Oh, I'm about to go on assignment.

09:52.900 --> 09:56.200
Angel wants me to start tailing Illyria,
keep tabs on her.

09:56.200 --> 09:58.700
Got a little walkie-talkie
and everything.

09:58.700 --> 10:01.700
<i>Guess Illyria is still</i>
<i>the headline around here.</i>

10:01.700 --> 10:07.300
Front page news and a walking obituary.
Strange times, huh?

10:08.400 --> 10:13.400
Strange times.
Have you talked to Wes?

10:13.400 --> 10:17.700
Well, we've exchanged words.
I wouldn't exactly call it talking.

10:17.700 --> 10:20.500
He's still reeling since
Our Lady of the Blue Bummer arrived.

10:20.500 --> 10:23.900
- Yeah, I was just in his office, and he was...
- Oh, God, don't go in there!

10:23.900 --> 10:27.300
- That's where he keeps his full-strength crazy.
- Yeah, caught a whiff of that.

10:27.300 --> 10:30.500
L-It's like he's two different people.
One is almost catatonic.

10:30.500 --> 10:33.300
He's the guy you see doing
the impatient shuffle around the hallways.

10:33.300 --> 10:36.100
And the other is just
cooped up in there all day...

10:36.100 --> 10:38.100
jittering like
a bug on a hot plate...

10:38.100 --> 10:40.700
obsessing over every single tidbit
he can find on Illyria.

10:40.700 --> 10:44.600
- What's Angel say about it?
- Oh, he's not very talky these days either.

10:44.600 --> 10:49.000
<i>- [Walkie-talkie Beeping]</i>
<i>- Lorne, it's Angel. Can you hear me?</i>

10:49.000 --> 10:51.300
Uh, 10-4, good buddy.

10:51.300 --> 10:56.200
<i>- Lorne, we're gonna meet in my offiice, now.</i>
- Uh, copy that.

10:56.200 --> 11:00.700
Okay. Upshot is you don't like Babe the Blue
Ox, in your house and you want to get rid of her.

11:00.700 --> 11:03.500
- Yeah.
- So? Are we talking pasture...

11:03.500 --> 11:05.700
or slaughterhouse?

11:07.200 --> 11:10.100
She didn't have a problem
with killing Fred, did she?

11:10.100 --> 11:15.800
Illyria infected Fred with no
more malice than a viral phage.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.800
<i>Hey, look, Wes, I know you're</i>
<i>bonding with her, but...</i>

11:17.800 --> 11:22.300
But she's unpredictable, dangerous, too
powerful a being, too close to being an enemy.

11:22.300 --> 11:24.800
Yes, Angel, it's self-evident.

11:24.800 --> 11:26.700
Which means we have to
find some kind of weakness.

11:26.700 --> 11:30.200
<i>- Some point of vulnerability.</i>
<i>- You want me to find a way to kill her.</i>

11:31.200 --> 11:35.100
- You got a problem with that?
- No.

11:35.300 --> 11:37.800
Good. Because we got more than
enough problems to worry about.

11:37.800 --> 11:40.800
Yeah. For example,
what about the apocalypse?

11:40.800 --> 11:44.000
Still trying to get my head around that one.
Lindsey said we're in the middle of it?

11:44.000 --> 11:47.600
Oh, yes, the thousand-year war of
good versus evil is well underway.

11:47.600 --> 11:51.100
<i>Evil just hasn't told anyone about it yet,</i>
<i>which is probably why they're winning.</i>

11:51.100 --> 11:53.900
Oh, by the way,
we're apparently on the wrong side.

11:53.900 --> 11:56.100
Or the right side,
if you like winning.

11:56.100 --> 11:59.300
- Sounds like you guys are buying it.
- Next time you go out there...

11:59.300 --> 12:02.900
take a good look around,
'cause it's true, Gunn.

12:04.400 --> 12:07.000
Works for me.
So what's that mean for us?

12:07.000 --> 12:10.800
Tell us how we fight an invisible war.
I don't even know who we're fighting.

12:12.300 --> 12:14.300
All the evil we've stopped so far...

12:14.300 --> 12:18.000
- and we're still the partners' number-one earner.
<i>- [Hamilton] Not anymore.</i>

12:18.000 --> 12:20.400
<i>Let me ask you something, Angel.</i>

12:20.400 --> 12:23.800
You ever heard the term
"surgical strike?"

12:23.800 --> 12:25.700
Ever heard of the term "appointment?"

12:25.700 --> 12:29.000
Illyria destroyed 11 torture units
before she found your man...

12:29.000 --> 12:31.500
<i>two troop carriers,</i>
<i>an ice cream truck...</i>

12:31.500 --> 12:34.100
and eight beautifully
maintained lawns.

12:34.100 --> 12:37.300
<i>Not to mention dozens of employees</i>
<i>rendered useless to the company.</i>

12:37.300 --> 12:39.700
- Bill me.
- Oh, we will.

12:39.700 --> 12:42.400
The damages are coming
directly out of this division's profits.

12:42.400 --> 12:45.300
Congratulations.
In one swift stroke...

12:45.300 --> 12:48.900
you've gone from leader
of the pack to staggering at the rear.

12:48.900 --> 12:51.200
- And?
<i>- Angel...</i>

12:51.200 --> 12:54.700
you're a motivated go-getter
at the top of the corporate ladder.

12:54.700 --> 12:56.600
Why don't you figure out
what comes after "and."

12:56.600 --> 12:59.200
- We're workin' on that.
- Yes, I'm sure you are.

12:59.200 --> 13:03.000
In the meantime, the partners have
a small task they'd like you to oversee.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
I'm sending Gunn the file.
It's good to see you again, by the way.

13:07.100 --> 13:10.500
<i>It's a simple matter,</i>
<i>but with some very big players.</i>

13:10.500 --> 13:13.100
If this is our chance to get into
a better grace with the head office...

13:13.100 --> 13:15.000
I'd have to say it's not my priority.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.800
Oh, no, don't think about us, Angel.
Think about profits.

13:18.800 --> 13:23.200
It's profits that let you keep this plucky
little boatload of good above water.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.800
It's business, boys,
not a bat cave.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.700
<i>[Door Closes]</i>

13:27.700 --> 13:31.400
Well, I'll tell you what.
I still like him better than Eve.

13:36.100 --> 13:38.500
This day.

13:38.500 --> 13:43.200
What name is it given
in your cycle of days?

13:43.200 --> 13:45.200
I give it...

13:47.200 --> 13:49.100
Monday.

13:49.100 --> 13:51.000
This conversation.

13:53.900 --> 13:57.300
- We've had it before.
- Well, yes.

13:57.300 --> 14:02.000
We've discussed our system
of temporal measurement...

14:02.000 --> 14:07.700
and our technology, weights and measures,
local customs, world history...

14:07.700 --> 14:11.500
- You're my guide.
- Apparently.

14:11.800 --> 14:15.300
You're more than that.

14:15.300 --> 14:17.300
Really?

14:19.700 --> 14:22.700
You're my betrayer.

14:22.700 --> 14:25.600
When you shattered the Window of Orlon,
you meant to change the past.

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
To rewrite your history
and the history of this body.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.200
And instead, I brought back
more painful memories.

14:35.300 --> 14:37.300
It was a failure.

14:37.300 --> 14:40.000
I've come to understand how irreversible
the works of time are.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.700
- But you intended to alter them.
- I wanted to bring back Fred.

14:42.700 --> 14:45.700
- And destroy me.
- As an unavoidable consequence.

14:49.200 --> 14:51.500
Does it sting you?

14:51.500 --> 14:53.400
<i>My betrayal?</i>

14:55.100 --> 14:57.200
Betrayal was a neutral word in my day.

14:58.800 --> 15:02.000
As unjudged a word
as "water" or "breeze."

15:02.000 --> 15:03.900
No.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.800
Or perhaps...

15:08.800 --> 15:12.100
I am only bothered
because I am bothered.

15:15.400 --> 15:18.800
That sounds very close to human.

15:18.800 --> 15:20.800
Motes of dust.

15:20.800 --> 15:24.700
Mayflies who die so soon after they're born
they might as well not live at all.

15:24.700 --> 15:27.700
Now, now. Manners.

15:27.700 --> 15:31.300
Just got the file from Hamilton.
Skimming it now.

15:31.300 --> 15:33.600
Looks like some sort
of ceremonial demon pact.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.700
- You have to sign as witness for the firm.
- You've met Hamilton.

15:36.700 --> 15:41.100
- Sorry?
- The new liaison. You met him before today?

15:41.100 --> 15:43.100
Yeah.

15:43.100 --> 15:46.900
Came down to my basement for a visit while
I was getting carved. Offered to get me out.

15:46.900 --> 15:49.300
And what'd you say?

15:49.300 --> 15:51.700
You really have to ask me that?

15:51.700 --> 15:53.800
I really do.

15:53.800 --> 15:58.700
I turned him down.
Not into making deals. Not anymore.

15:58.700 --> 16:01.200
Well, that's gonna make it
tough to be a lawyer.

16:01.200 --> 16:03.100
It was tough already.

16:03.100 --> 16:06.300
Making business go smoothly
for a bunch of hideous, scaly, evil clients.

16:06.300 --> 16:08.900
<i>Excuse me.</i>

16:08.900 --> 16:10.900
I'm here about the demon pact.

16:12.600 --> 16:15.400
They found me. They said that
they had these seer people...

16:15.400 --> 16:19.100
who told them that my baby
was some kind of holy one.

16:19.100 --> 16:21.100
They said it was a prophecy.

16:21.100 --> 16:23.200
<i>How much do you know</i>
<i>about the Fell Brethren?</i>

16:23.200 --> 16:25.500
Well, they're really religious.

16:25.500 --> 16:29.200
I mean, their religion,
not the God one.

16:29.200 --> 16:31.600
<i>But they've been really supportive.</i>

16:31.600 --> 16:34.900
They're always bringing me
special shakes and vitamins.

16:34.900 --> 16:38.900
- You realize they're demons.
- Uh-huh. They're very open about it.

16:39.100 --> 16:41.700
<i>Well, any demonic pact</i>
<i>should be entered into with caution.</i>

16:41.700 --> 16:44.500
Uh, they can be riddled with
obscure clauses and double-talk.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.900
- As our client, we have to advise you to...
<i>- She's not your client.</i>

16:48.500 --> 16:50.400
We are.

16:58.400 --> 17:01.300
Odd.

17:01.300 --> 17:04.300
It doesn't exist until it cracks apart.

17:04.300 --> 17:06.000
What's that?

17:07.500 --> 17:09.400
Time.

17:11.900 --> 17:13.900
You don't look altogether well.

17:16.200 --> 17:18.700
Your opinion of me
weighs less than sunlight.

17:21.700 --> 17:23.800
- Illyria!
- Wes, do it now!

17:25.700 --> 17:28.200
<i>[Spike]</i>
<i>Got her winded at least, didn't I?</i>

17:28.200 --> 17:31.300
That's right, little Shiva.
Reckon you'll think twice next time.

17:38.200 --> 17:40.700
<i>[Spike] Good knee to the ribs does</i>
<i>tend to catch up on you, doesn't it?</i>

17:52.200 --> 17:54.500
Illyria?

17:56.400 --> 17:59.000
You tried to murder me.

18:01.100 --> 18:04.400
- Again.
- What? I haven't.

18:04.400 --> 18:07.600
I don't want you dead, believe me.

18:07.600 --> 18:11.200
I was there. I saw it.

18:18.700 --> 18:21.200
Bluebird is in flight.

18:23.300 --> 18:26.200
<i>[Whispering, Indistinct]</i>

18:27.700 --> 18:30.400
Okay, Angel just needs
another few minutes.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.300
Can I go ahead and grab you
anything to drink?

18:32.300 --> 18:36.200
Coffee? Tea?
Got blood.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.500
What's he doing in there
with the Holy Vessel?

18:38.500 --> 18:40.600
And a variety of organic colas.

18:40.600 --> 18:44.000
The Brethren have a delicate
relationship with the vessel.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
If she's presenting any problems,
we should be the ones to...

18:47.000 --> 18:51.400
Believe me, Angel will take care
of everything. That's what he does.

18:51.400 --> 18:55.800
Yep. I'm sure he's in there,
you know, getting into her head.

18:55.800 --> 18:58.200
Sowing the seeds of fear.

18:58.200 --> 19:01.500
Don't you worry.
He will snap her like a pregnant twig.

19:02.600 --> 19:05.200
[Whispering, Indistinct]

19:07.300 --> 19:09.200
We'll try an organic cola.

19:11.900 --> 19:14.500
- Thank you.
- [Whispering, Indistinct]

19:14.500 --> 19:17.900
- You sure you want to do this?
- Yeah, because it's not too late, Amanda.

19:17.900 --> 19:21.500
This contract has some wiggle room
somewhere in there. They always do.

19:21.500 --> 19:24.400
But aren't you the guys that
are supposed to tell me to do it?

19:24.400 --> 19:29.400
- We are, and, well, we're not. We, uh...
- [Beeping]

19:29.400 --> 19:32.300
[Lorne] Angel-ears,
this is Secret Demon. Come in.

19:32.300 --> 19:36.600
[Sighs] Listen, I've had
this talk before, believe me.

19:36.600 --> 19:41.800
I know it sounds bad giving up your
unborn baby to a supernatural cult, but...

19:41.800 --> 19:44.800
- [Beeping]
- Sorry.

19:44.800 --> 19:47.500
- [Beeps]
- Go on.

19:47.500 --> 19:52.000
See, their entire nation believes
my child is their next...

19:52.000 --> 19:55.400
you know, like the Dalai Lama.

19:55.400 --> 19:57.800
They're gonna worship him.

19:57.800 --> 19:59.800
He'll be cared for better
than we could ever.

19:59.800 --> 20:02.000
And he'll be someone.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.800
Somebody important.
We'd never be able to give him that.

20:06.100 --> 20:10.400
<i>Amanda, the Fell Brethren leader makes</i>
<i>Jim Jones look like a Sunday school teacher.</i>

20:12.100 --> 20:15.200
- Who's Jim Jones?
- It doesn't matter.

20:15.200 --> 20:18.700
Mr. Gunn, we can't afford this baby.

20:20.200 --> 20:23.400
My husband, he was hurt at work.

20:23.400 --> 20:26.900
<i>Brain damage, doctors say.</i>
<i>Incurable.</i>

20:26.900 --> 20:29.900
We're scraping by on
food stamps and disability.

20:31.900 --> 20:37.100
But the Brethren,
they say they can make him whole again.

20:37.100 --> 20:41.100
Make him remember who I am.

20:42.600 --> 20:47.000
I mean, how does a person
turn all that down?

20:56.500 --> 20:59.300
[Sighs]
Excuse us.

21:04.300 --> 21:06.300
[Sighs]

21:07.800 --> 21:09.800
I'm not feelin' so good.

21:09.800 --> 21:13.100
Well, first day back from a vacation
in hell. You know, I'm not surprised.

21:13.100 --> 21:15.000
<i>You know what the worst part</i>
<i>of that place was?</i>

21:15.000 --> 21:19.700
It wasn't the basement.
At least there, you knew where you stood.

21:19.700 --> 21:22.900
Demon was gonna cut your heart out
and show it to you.

21:22.900 --> 21:26.700
No. It was the fake life
they gave you upstairs.

21:26.700 --> 21:29.900
<i>Wife, kids, all the icing</i>
<i>on the family cake.</i>

21:31.500 --> 21:33.700
But somewhere underneath it...

21:33.700 --> 21:36.600
there was the nagging certainty
that it was all lies.

21:36.600 --> 21:39.900
<i>That all the smiles</i>
<i>and the birthday candles...</i>

21:39.900 --> 21:43.400
and the homework were just
there to hide the horror.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.300
Is that all we're doin' here?

21:45.300 --> 21:48.100
- Just hidin' the horror?
- No.

21:48.100 --> 21:50.800
'Cause I don't think I can stomach it anymore.
Not after all that's happened.

21:50.800 --> 21:53.700
You have to.
Listen to me, Gunn.

21:53.700 --> 21:55.700
I need you to get through this.

21:55.700 --> 21:59.200
<i>To get through all of it so we can figure out</i>
<i>the big picture and plot our next move.</i>

21:59.200 --> 22:02.900
Angel, she is our next move.

22:02.900 --> 22:06.500
Um, the Brethren have
finished their colas, Angel...

22:06.500 --> 22:09.000
- and the sugar high isn't making them any less...
- Send them in, Harmony.

22:17.400 --> 22:20.900
<i>[Footsteps]</i>

22:22.500 --> 22:24.600
Curing cancer, Mr. Wyndam-Pryce?

22:25.800 --> 22:28.300
Wouldn't be cost-effective.

22:28.300 --> 22:30.500
I'm sure we make a lot from cancer.

22:30.500 --> 22:33.700
Yes. The patent holder is a client.

22:35.800 --> 22:39.800
So, how's the science game?

22:39.800 --> 22:42.000
I realize you're just filling in.
But, uh...

22:42.000 --> 22:44.900
Do you have a specific need,
Mr. Hamilton?

22:44.900 --> 22:47.300
I'm just wondering if anything
turned up on Illyria.

22:47.300 --> 22:49.200
We have our concerns
about her, too, you know.

22:50.500 --> 22:54.500
Common ground.
Mystifying.

22:54.500 --> 22:57.400
<i>- She's a walking nightmare, isn't she?</i>
- Well put.

22:57.400 --> 22:59.700
And yet you seem to be
the closest thing she has to a friend.

22:59.700 --> 23:03.100
[Laughing]

23:03.100 --> 23:08.100
If you knew her, you'd realize
the absurdity of that statement.

23:08.100 --> 23:11.900
Well, the partners know her, Wesley.

23:12.200 --> 23:15.800
Yes, they go way back.
They don't want her here.

23:15.800 --> 23:19.800
<i>They don't want her anywhere at all.</i>

23:20.000 --> 23:23.200
<i>But they consider this to be your problem,</i>
<i>so have a nice fight.</i>

23:23.200 --> 23:28.900
<i>Oh. You might want to try taking a look</i>
<i>at the low-emanation scanner readouts.</i>

23:28.900 --> 23:30.700
Just a thought.

23:39.600 --> 23:42.300
<i>[Keyboarding]</i>

23:42.300 --> 23:44.200
[Beeping]

23:46.400 --> 23:51.700
<i>[Lorne] I repeat... Bluebird got wise.</i>
<i>Secret Demon's cover is blown.</i>

23:51.700 --> 23:56.200
- Over... H-Hello? Is this on?
- [Beeping]

23:56.200 --> 24:01.100
Hey, Lyri, when did you catch onto me?
In the elevator? That was a tough one.

24:01.100 --> 24:04.900
- The vampire plays children's games.
- Oh, tag, you're it, honey.

24:06.000 --> 24:10.500
Amanda.
You look wonderful! Huh?

24:10.500 --> 24:13.000
Huh? So full of life.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.600
<i>So, how's our little oven-bun?</i>
<i>Still kicking up a storm, I hope.</i>

24:15.600 --> 24:20.300
- Third trimester!
- Any more pressure? Shortness of breath?

24:20.300 --> 24:22.500
Well, that's normal.

24:22.500 --> 24:24.400
- Are you taking the black cohosh we sent?
<i>- [Amanda] Mm-hmm.</i>

24:24.400 --> 24:27.400
<i>Lovely. Gripmack clipped some articles</i>
<i>out of this month's</i> Fit Pregnancy.

24:27.400 --> 24:29.300
<i>- We'll send those along.</i>
- If we can we get underway.

24:29.300 --> 24:31.400
Ahh. Mm-hmm. Good.

24:34.300 --> 24:39.300
And there and done.

24:39.300 --> 24:42.600
- There you are, Amanda.
<i>- Wait a minute. "Gordabach"?</i>

24:42.600 --> 24:46.400
Yes, Gordabach.
Just sign right there, Mom.

24:46.700 --> 24:48.800
<i>No, hang on.</i>
<i>I just want to get this clause straight.</i>

24:48.800 --> 24:50.800
"The child will be
pampered, worshipped...

24:50.800 --> 24:53.600
and fed a holy diet of berries,
panda meat and urine."

24:53.600 --> 24:57.200
- Well, it's consecrated urine.
<i>- "And on the eve ofhis 13th year...</i>

24:57.200 --> 24:59.100
he will be prepared for
the rites of Gordabach."

24:59.100 --> 25:03.800
- That's what, like a bar mitzvah?
- Well, there'll be gifts.

25:03.800 --> 25:07.800
- Amanda, it's a ritual sacri...
- Whose lawyer are you?

25:09.600 --> 25:12.500
- You will speak to me.
- In the middle of something.

25:12.500 --> 25:14.900
- Then I will end it.
- Yeah, okay.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.400
- Who's this?
- Come with me.

25:21.400 --> 25:24.200
Well, do you copy ever? Over!

25:24.200 --> 25:26.100
Hey, is your thingy on?

25:26.100 --> 25:28.000
Oh, I'll just wait here then.

25:30.500 --> 25:32.700
You don't interrupt our work,
you understand me?

25:32.700 --> 25:35.700
What is it?
Poison? Magics?

25:35.700 --> 25:38.000
It impresses me, the power of it.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
<i>Whatever you've done,</i>
<i>it can't save you.</i>

25:41.000 --> 25:44.500
To do anything but bow to my will is absurd,
yet you conspire...

25:44.500 --> 25:47.400
We haven't done anything to you.

25:47.400 --> 25:52.300
Jealous. Plankton envying
the ocean that holds them.

25:52.300 --> 25:54.600
Yeah, that's great.
Listen, I got things...

25:54.600 --> 25:56.500
Ridiculous apes.

25:56.500 --> 25:59.000
My death won't prevent your dying.
What have you done to me?

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Get your damn hands off me.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.600
You don't know.
Not yet.

26:04.600 --> 26:06.600
It's too early.

26:08.500 --> 26:12.200
You gotta keep your thingy on for
this to work, okay? Oh, that's mature.

26:13.500 --> 26:15.500
Boss, it's getting a little
shouty in your office.

26:15.500 --> 26:18.400
- Let Gunn take care of it.
- [Sighs]

26:18.400 --> 26:21.300
Illyria's blown all her gaskets, man.
She's out of her mind.

26:21.300 --> 26:26.100
How can you tell? Yesterday she spent
two hours mind-melding with a potted fern.

26:26.100 --> 26:28.500
- She thinks I'm trying to kill her.
- Aren't you?

26:28.500 --> 26:31.800
Tell me you have something, Wes.
Just anything.

26:31.800 --> 26:36.300
She is unstable.
Overloading, to be more accurate.

26:36.300 --> 26:40.300
The fusion between her demon essence and
her host's body seems to be deteriorating.

26:40.500 --> 26:45.200
It's as if the human part of her can no
longer contain the demonic power within.

26:45.200 --> 26:47.200
We're thinkin' that she
cracked her engine block...

26:47.200 --> 26:50.300
- and now she's leakin' petrol
all over the building.
- She's going to self-destruct.

26:50.300 --> 26:54.300
<i>- Violently and soon.</i>
- And you were going to tell me this when?

26:54.500 --> 26:57.800
- I wasn't. Spike and I were dealing with it.
- We're motivated go-getters.

26:57.800 --> 27:01.400
<i>The good news is the crack in her engine</i>
<i>block may give us a chance to get to her.</i>

27:02.800 --> 27:04.800
This is a Mutari generator.

27:04.800 --> 27:08.000
<i>It creates a pinhole to an infinite</i>
<i>extra-dimensional space.</i>

27:08.000 --> 27:11.300
A negatively charged pocket universe
that should draw her radiant essence...

27:11.300 --> 27:14.500
- her power, into itself by process of a...
<i>- Wes?</i>

27:14.500 --> 27:17.900
Will it kill her?

27:17.900 --> 27:19.900
Yes. Shall we go?

27:19.900 --> 27:23.200
- We have to find out where she, uh...
- Oh, here.

27:23.200 --> 27:26.200
- [Beeping]
- Training room, looks like.

27:26.200 --> 27:29.300
<i>- [Beeping Continues]</i>
- And gushin' petrol like a geyser.

27:32.100 --> 27:35.500
So what sort of damage are we lookin' at
if Illyria Chernobyls on us?

27:35.500 --> 27:38.700
- Conservative guess, several city blocks.
- And what about unconservative?

27:38.700 --> 27:41.500
Rand and McNally will
have to redraw their maps.

27:41.500 --> 27:43.800
- She in there?
- Do you even know how to use this thing?

27:45.200 --> 27:47.300
Well, that's funny.
I didn't see her leave.

27:50.900 --> 27:53.300
Well, that's the problem.
You don't always see her when...

27:55.000 --> 27:56.600
- Illyria!
- Wes, do it now.

28:30.400 --> 28:33.000
- [Panting]
<i>- [Angel] We haven't done anything to you.</i>

28:34.300 --> 28:39.100
Jealous. Plankton envying
the ocean that holds them.

28:39.100 --> 28:41.400
Yeah, that's great.
Listen, I got things...

28:41.400 --> 28:43.400
Ridiculous apes.

28:43.400 --> 28:45.900
My death won't prevent your dying.
What have you done to me?

28:45.900 --> 28:48.300
Get your damn hands off me.

28:48.300 --> 28:51.300
<i>[Wes]</i>
<i>You all right?</i>

28:51.300 --> 28:53.600
No, I'm not all right.
What the hell did you do to me?

28:53.600 --> 28:56.900
- Angel...
- You weren't here before.

28:56.900 --> 28:58.800
Where did...
What just happened?

28:58.800 --> 29:00.800
An aberration in the time line.

29:00.800 --> 29:03.400
It wasn't like this.

29:03.400 --> 29:05.300
[Groaning]

29:07.100 --> 29:09.200
<i>Damn it.!</i>

29:09.200 --> 29:11.100
What the hell is this?

29:11.100 --> 29:13.600
You followed me.

29:13.600 --> 29:17.300
- Gunn?
<i>- You've been swept up in my wake.</i>

29:17.300 --> 29:20.500
- This is the holding dimension.
- How did you worms accomplish this?

29:20.500 --> 29:22.900
We didn't. We...
Accomplish what?

29:22.900 --> 29:24.900
You ripped me out
of linear progression.

29:24.900 --> 29:27.900
Tore my time line into shreds
and stitched it back together out of sequence.

29:27.900 --> 29:31.700
- Are you kidding?
- You caged me in this fractured time frame...

29:31.700 --> 29:35.700
in moments that repeat themselves
over and over without deviation.

29:35.900 --> 29:38.500
But I don't say these words.

29:41.200 --> 29:45.700
I rip the necklace off.
I lift him from the table. We speak.

29:45.700 --> 29:47.900
And the demon attacks again.

29:50.000 --> 29:54.700
Is it of your sciences?
How do you unweave time in this way?

29:54.700 --> 29:57.300
This isn't us.
We don't have the power to...

29:58.500 --> 30:01.400
Do you know what you were
when I was young?

30:01.400 --> 30:03.800
You were the muck at our feet.

30:03.800 --> 30:05.900
We called you
"the ooze that eats itself."

30:08.400 --> 30:12.400
You were pretty at night.
You sparkled and you stank.

30:12.400 --> 30:15.500
- You still stink of it.
<i>- Will you just shut up for once?</i>

30:15.500 --> 30:18.400
- What?
- My God, the speechifying.
Has it ever occurred to you...

30:18.400 --> 30:21.600
that now might not be the best time
for "when we were muck" stories?

30:21.600 --> 30:24.200
- You dare to speak to me in this...
- Yes, I dare!

30:24.200 --> 30:27.000
And, yes, we are looking for a way of
controlling you any way that we can.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.400
I can't have an X-factor like you
bouncing around unchecked.

30:30.400 --> 30:34.300
- Bouncing around?
- I know you would do the same thing.
I know that for a fact.

30:34.600 --> 30:37.400
- But this is my kingdom, lady, not yours.
- Your kingdom?

30:37.400 --> 30:41.700
I am Illyria, God-King of the Primordium,
Shaper ofThings!

30:41.700 --> 30:44.400
- Yeah, well, that was then. This is...
- [Screaming]

30:45.700 --> 30:47.600
Now.

30:47.600 --> 30:51.200
Yes. Nothing's what
it used to be, is it?

30:54.100 --> 30:58.100
- No.
<i>- These are the fruits</i>
<i>of your attempt to murder me.</i>

30:58.300 --> 31:01.600
<i>Your kingdom turned</i>
<i>to ash and stale wind.</i>

31:05.000 --> 31:06.900
I slew the white-haired one first.

31:08.200 --> 31:11.100
- But this can't be.
- And then Wesley...

31:11.100 --> 31:15.700
<i>as he raised his weapon and your</i>
<i>demon clown as he wilted in terror.</i>

31:15.700 --> 31:20.100
- And I'm next.
- No, vampire.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.300
You were last.

31:24.300 --> 31:27.100
Why?

31:27.100 --> 31:29.100
You know nothing of this.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.300
You're from an earlier point
in the time line.

31:35.300 --> 31:38.200
You're a paradox.
You're impossible.

31:40.300 --> 31:42.600
- We attacked you.
- I didn't give you the chance.

31:42.600 --> 31:45.300
That you learn
when you become a king.

31:45.300 --> 31:47.200
<i>[Groans]</i>

31:47.200 --> 31:51.600
You learn to destroy everything
that's not utterly yours.

31:51.600 --> 31:54.400
<i>All that matters is victory.</i>

31:54.400 --> 31:56.200
That's how your reign persists.

31:59.400 --> 32:02.500
You're a slave to an insane construct.

32:04.700 --> 32:07.000
You are moral.

32:07.000 --> 32:11.300
[Scoffs]
A true ruler is as moral as a hurricane.

32:11.300 --> 32:15.300
Empty but for the force of his gale.

32:19.100 --> 32:21.700
But you...
[Panting]

32:21.700 --> 32:25.000
<i>Trapped in the web of the wolf,</i>
<i>the ram, the hart.</i>

32:25.000 --> 32:28.100
So much power here.

32:28.100 --> 32:30.500
And you quibble at its price.

32:33.100 --> 32:38.200
If you want to win a war, you must
serve no master but your ambition.

32:39.300 --> 32:42.600
[Groaning]

32:42.600 --> 32:45.200
You have not lied.

32:45.200 --> 32:49.200
<i>My undoing is beyond you, your people.</i>

32:49.200 --> 32:51.100
Something is broken inside me.

32:51.100 --> 32:54.400
[Groans]
My power is too great.

32:54.400 --> 33:00.100
I know this now, as I know it
every time I come to this moment.

33:00.100 --> 33:03.800
Illyria, if I am here, if I am paradox,
then this can all change, can't it?

33:03.800 --> 33:07.000
<i>You said things have been altered. What you</i>
<i>said, did. You can change this outcome.</i>

33:07.000 --> 33:09.800
Change is constant.

33:09.800 --> 33:11.900
Yet things remain the same.

33:18.000 --> 33:21.200
<i>[Spike] So what sort of damage are</i>
<i>we lookin'at if Illyria Chernobyls on us?</i>

33:21.200 --> 33:25.100
- Conservative guess, several city blocks.
- Wes, you're alive.

33:25.300 --> 33:27.500
Illyria, she's self-destructing.
She's a time bomb.

33:27.500 --> 33:29.500
- Read today's paper, did you?
- What?

33:29.500 --> 33:31.400
You've been yappin' about bloody nothin'
but that for the last 10 minutes.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.100
No, no. I just left a meeting with Illyria.

33:33.100 --> 33:35.200
<i>She grabbed me and we phased through</i>
<i>time. I don't think she meant to do it.</i>

33:35.200 --> 33:38.400
- Look, she's overloading. She's gonna explode.
<i>- [Wes] Yes, we know.</i>

33:38.400 --> 33:41.000
Angel, we've been over all this.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.200
Do you even know
how to use this thing?

33:43.200 --> 33:46.400
She's come unstuck in time, Wes.
She knows what happens. She's seen it.

33:46.400 --> 33:48.500
She-She knows we want to kill her.

33:48.500 --> 33:50.300
Yes, she said that to me as well.

33:51.600 --> 33:55.200
Oh, guys, this isn't good.

33:55.200 --> 33:58.300
- That's funny. I didn't even see her leave.
- Well, that's the problem.

33:58.300 --> 34:00.800
"Slew the white-haired one first."

34:00.800 --> 34:04.000
- Don't always see her when she's bugger...
- [Yells]

34:07.200 --> 34:09.900
[Groans]
Wait. Wait!

34:11.800 --> 34:14.400
Illyria, wait, please.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.500
Wes, put that thing down.
Spike, nobody move.

34:17.600 --> 34:21.500
This too. All changing.
[Groans]

34:21.500 --> 34:23.500
I know what happens.
I know you kill us all.

34:23.500 --> 34:25.199
Oh, a bit pessimistic, aren't you?

34:25.199 --> 34:27.100
And then you shudder
and you convulse with pain...

34:27.100 --> 34:29.699
- and then the power inside you explodes.
<i>- You are the Angel from the past.</i>

34:29.699 --> 34:32.100
You were swept up in my wake.

34:32.100 --> 34:35.199
You're not a king anymore.
Your domain is gone, swallowed by time.

34:35.199 --> 34:38.400
- We've had this conversation.
- You explode. I was there.

34:38.400 --> 34:40.300
It was powerful enough
to blow me back through time.

34:40.300 --> 34:42.100
<i>I have no idea what</i>
<i>it does to the building.</i>

34:42.100 --> 34:44.300
More like the continental shelf, actually.

34:44.300 --> 34:47.800
I have to stop that. Do you understand?
I cannot have your death blow away my...

34:47.800 --> 34:51.100
- Your kingdom?
- Yeah, sure. Whatever.

34:53.600 --> 34:57.900
- You ask me to allow you to murder me.
- It's not murder if you say yes.

34:57.900 --> 35:01.100
<i>No one is murdering you.</i>
<i>This device won't kill you.</i>

35:01.100 --> 35:04.900
- What? You said...
- I lied.

35:07.600 --> 35:10.400
Illyria, this device will draw
the energy away from you safely.

35:10.400 --> 35:14.700
- It will allow you to live.
- Your intent is not murder?

35:14.700 --> 35:18.100
- It never was.
- Well, no harm, no foul.

35:18.100 --> 35:21.100
But you tried to destroy me.
To bring back Fred.

35:21.100 --> 35:25.600
That didn't work.
It was a failure.

35:25.600 --> 35:30.200
<i>- But now I know you're all that's left.</i>
<i>- You want to take my power...</i>

35:30.200 --> 35:32.800
to let me live.

35:32.800 --> 35:35.000
But I am my power.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.100
And I would rather be a titanic crater
than to be like unto you.

35:43.200 --> 35:46.800
I kill you.
That's how this ends.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.600
Gettin' ahead of ourselves a bit.

36:02.400 --> 36:05.900
Illyria, the future can change here.
You can choose a different path.

36:05.900 --> 36:08.900
- And be nothing.
- And be what you are.

36:08.900 --> 36:14.100
- [Groans]
- Fighting to hold on to what you were,
it's destroying you.

36:16.100 --> 36:18.500
You would do this to me?

36:18.500 --> 36:22.000
I'd try, anyway.
Every time.

36:25.100 --> 36:27.100
I possess so much grace.

36:27.100 --> 36:32.000
More grace than this
bag of sticks could express.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.200
I was the immaculate
embodiment of rule.

36:37.500 --> 36:39.900
I blame this on the weakness
of your species.

36:39.900 --> 36:41.700
Fair enough.

36:54.600 --> 36:57.300
Illyria?

36:57.300 --> 37:00.500
Touch me and die, vermin.

37:01.600 --> 37:03.500
Not a very dramatic difference, really.

37:06.400 --> 37:08.300
Everything is different.

37:16.300 --> 37:19.400
So what's the prognosis?

37:19.400 --> 37:22.300
She won't be stopping time...

37:22.300 --> 37:25.300
or walking through dimensions.

37:25.300 --> 37:29.200
And I suspect her physical strength
has decreased somewhat.

37:29.400 --> 37:31.500
That's what I wanted to hear.

37:34.500 --> 37:36.300
You're gonna stay with her,
aren't you?

37:40.500 --> 37:43.300
Yes.

37:43.300 --> 37:45.700
[Sighs]
Wes...

37:46.700 --> 37:48.800
I don't like where this is going.

37:50.400 --> 37:52.300
I don't like where this has been.

37:54.100 --> 37:57.200
I'm not in love
with this thing, Angel.

37:57.200 --> 38:02.000
But for some reason,
I need it right now.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.300
Yeah. That's just weird.

38:09.800 --> 38:12.300
I know.

38:15.600 --> 38:17.900
She could still prove
to be problematic for us.

38:17.900 --> 38:20.200
Much of what she was is still intact.

38:20.200 --> 38:24.600
I doubt she'll ever stop
trying to conquer...

38:24.600 --> 38:26.500
everything.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.300
"Serve no master
but your ambition."

38:31.300 --> 38:35.700
- What's that?
- I think you may have been right before.

38:35.700 --> 38:38.900
About Illyria being a resource.

38:40.200 --> 38:42.300
She just might make the team yet.

38:47.100 --> 38:49.700
<i>[Fell Demon] We've sought this child for</i>
<i>decades. We're not letting go of it now.!</i>

38:49.700 --> 38:52.100
<i>[Gunn] Only the mother's consent</i>
<i>will sanctify this transaction.</i>

38:52.100 --> 38:53.900
<i>- That's exactly what we have.</i>
<i>- Oh, yeah? Show it to me.</i>

38:53.900 --> 38:56.500
It's an agreement in principle.
The child is ours.

38:56.500 --> 38:58.400
I can tear that apart in a courtroom.
Just watch me.

38:58.400 --> 39:01.300
- But we're paying you.
- We're not taking your money!

39:01.300 --> 39:03.200
I understand, Your Holiness, fully.

39:03.200 --> 39:05.700
If this gets fouled here
by that lunatic...

39:05.700 --> 39:07.800
<i>our hordes will fall on this place.</i>

39:07.800 --> 39:10.800
<i>There won't be so much</i>
<i>as an eyetooth left of any of them.!</i>

39:10.800 --> 39:14.000
Yes, well, that would be more
Angel's business than mine.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
<i>[Fell Demon] She won't make it</i>
<i>through another day.</i>

39:16.000 --> 39:20.300
- You think we can't protect her?
- The Fell are everywhere.
We are a force of nature.

39:20.300 --> 39:22.900
Gunn, the baby belongs to the Fell.

39:22.900 --> 39:26.100
What? She hasn't signed anything.
There's nothing on paper.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.900
Gentlemen.

39:34.700 --> 39:37.000
Angel.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.100
What are you doin'?

39:39.100 --> 39:41.500
What we're supposed to.

39:43.000 --> 39:46.800
