 slowed it down.

 something to this.

 was definitely slowed down,

 All right, you guys. How do you
 want to test this one?

07:24.844 --> 07:26.812
 I think the biggest issue
 is gonna be the fact

 that she didn't have
 a lot of room to punch.

07:28.314 --> 07:29.748
 She only had about three inches.

09:08.915 --> 09:11.915
 [ Birds chirping ]

09:12.151 --> 09:14.753
 So now it's time
 to crunch the numbers.

09:14.754 --> 09:16.755
 GRANT: We've brought
 our whole measurement system,

09:16.756 --> 09:18.657
 and we're going to measure
 his punch force.

09:18.658 --> 09:21.658
 I'll take
 his actual fighting glove

09:21.761 --> 09:24.095
 and calibrate that
 with our punching bag

09:24.096 --> 09:26.364
 and see exactly
 how hard he can punch.

09:26.365 --> 09:28.700
 TORY: So, this is
 our makeshift casket.

09:28.701 --> 09:30.101
 You're gonna lay down
 on your back

09:30.102 --> 09:31.770
 and punch up at the sensor.

09:31.771 --> 09:33.905
 NARRATOR:
 "The Fist" assumes the position.

09:33.906 --> 09:35.774
 Cramped as though in a casket,

09:35.775 --> 09:38.775
 it's this punch
 that's key to this myth.

09:40.346 --> 09:41.546
 So, what's the verdict?

09:41.547 --> 09:42.948
 GRANT:
 So, check this out.

09:42.949 --> 09:45.949
 Your force on your back at
 coffin height -- 1 ,482 pounds.

09:47.887 --> 09:50.887
 NARRATOR: So a trained fighter
 can three-inch punch

09:50.890 --> 09:53.325
 with 1 ,500 pounds of force.

09:53.326 --> 09:56.326
 So, now the boys need to
 bury themselves in this myth.

09:57.997 --> 10:00.031
 Next, we got
 another relatively hard object

10:00.032 --> 10:02.233
 that you might find
 in the average shirt pocket --

10:02.234 --> 10:03.568
 the MP3 player.

10:03.569 --> 10:06.569
 Supposedly stopped a round
 from an AK-47.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.407
 Looks like a little bit bigger
 of a target.

10:09.408 --> 10:11.843
 You think you can hit it?

10:11.844 --> 10:13.979
 Yeah.

10:13.980 --> 10:16.681
 I think I can hit it, old man.

10:16.682 --> 10:19.682
 Let's go.

10:20.219 --> 10:23.219
 NARRATOR: So, this story goes
 that an AK-47 slug

10:23.956 --> 10:26.956
 was stopped
 by a soldier's MP3 player.

10:26.959 --> 10:29.959
 But Adam, for one,
 ain't convinced.

10:30.329 --> 10:32.163
 What's in there?
 Well, I'll tell you.

10:32.164 --> 10:34.532
 This back metal plate
 is actually pretty thin --

10:34.533 --> 10:35.767
 about 1/32 of an inch.

10:35.768 --> 10:37.402
 It's stamped metal.

10:37.403 --> 10:39.237
 This front part
 is polycarbonate.

10:39.238 --> 10:41.006
 In there
 is a spinning hard drive

10:41.007 --> 10:44.007
 and a single board of
 electronics and not much else.

10:44.777 --> 10:46.645
 Not a lot
 of bullet-stopping potential.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.447
 That is my expert opinion.

10:49.448 --> 10:52.448
 NARRATOR: With the MP3 player
 ready to rock 'n' roll,

10:52.652 --> 10:55.652
 that just leaves the gun --
 a 100 % genuine AK-47.

10:58.457 --> 11:00.959
 I kind of... have a penchant
 for firing it.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.627
 Do you mind?

11:02.628 --> 11:03.628
 No.

11:03.629 --> 11:06.031
 NARRATOR: So, while Jamie
 tackles the tunes,

11:06.032 --> 11:08.800
 Adam feels okay with the A. K.

11:08.801 --> 11:10.402
 Here we go.

11:10.403 --> 11:13.403
 JAMIE:
 AK-47 into an MP3 player.

11:15.207 --> 11:18.207
 NARRATOR: Okay, it's a smash
 hit, but there's a problem.

11:18.511 --> 11:19.878
 [ Laughs ]

11:19.879 --> 11:22.714
 Well, that's one way
 to get the battery out.

11:22.715 --> 11:25.715
 NARRATOR: Our sharpshooter
 wasn't so sharp.

11:25.885 --> 11:28.885
 From just 10 feet away,
 he barely hit it.

11:29.088 --> 11:32.088
 For a reliable result,
 they're going to have to reload.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.559
 Yeah, I think we need to
 take another shot.

11:34.560 --> 11:36.094
 Yeah, I think I do.

11:36.095 --> 11:38.363
 Or maybe I get to take
 another shot.

11:38.364 --> 11:39.931
 No, no, no.

11:39.932 --> 11:41.733
 I get to make this work.

11:41.734 --> 11:44.002
 NARRATOR:
 So Adam, determined to get

11:44.003 --> 11:46.004
 at least one round
 on the charts,

11:46.005 --> 11:49.005
 sets up for a repeat run.

11:49.442 --> 11:52.442
 This time, the MP3 is down,
 but did the bullet go through?

11:53.579 --> 11:55.146
 Oh!

11:55.147 --> 11:57.348
 [ Laughs ]

11:57.349 --> 11:58.950
 Oh. Wait.

11:58.951 --> 12:00.685
 I can see you.

12:00.686 --> 12:02.620
 All the way through that.

12:02.621 --> 12:05.621
 NARRATOR:
 Yep, just like this MP3 player,

12:05.758 --> 12:07.859
 this myth is full of holes.

12:07.860 --> 12:10.495
 Like any good myth, this one
 has a grain of truth in it.

12:10.496 --> 12:13.364
 And our researchers did,
 in fact, turn up evidence

12:13.365 --> 12:16.365
 that a soldier was hit
 by an AK-47 round,

12:17.436 --> 12:20.436
 it went through his MP3 player,
 and he survived.

12:20.506 --> 12:23.506
 But here's the catch --
 he was also wearing body armor.

12:23.776 --> 12:26.776
 Now, body armor, MP3 player,

12:27.913 --> 12:29.714
 what do you think
 stopped the round?

12:29.715 --> 12:32.117
 My money has it
 on the body armor.

12:32.118 --> 12:34.452
 NARRATOR: And after
 all that sharpshootin',

12:34.453 --> 12:37.453
 time to tackle
 an even tastier tale.

12:37.523 --> 12:39.724
 Supposedly,
 a pizza-delivery boy

12:39.725 --> 12:42.725
 finds himself being fired upon
 by a shotgun,

12:43.896 --> 12:46.197
 holds his bag of pizzas
 in front of him,

12:46.198 --> 12:47.532
 and it saves his life.

12:47.533 --> 12:50.335
 Okay, well,
 let's lock and load.

12:50.336 --> 12:52.604
 NARRATOR:
 How's this for pizza pizzazz?

12:52.605 --> 12:54.839
 The story goes
 that a delivery boy,

12:54.840 --> 12:57.840
 peppered by shotgun pellets,
 was saved by three pizzas.

12:59.011 --> 13:01.112
 Well, not just his pizzas.

13:01.113 --> 13:03.414
 Don't forget about
 the warmer pack.

13:03.415 --> 13:04.582
 We've got your standard

13:04.583 --> 13:06.818
 pizza-delivery
 insulating bag here

13:06.819 --> 13:09.819
 with some
 heavy synthetic fabric,

13:09.855 --> 13:12.724
 webbing,
 some stuffing for insulation.

13:12.725 --> 13:15.460
 Inside --
 satiny kind of synthetic,

13:15.461 --> 13:18.196
 three cardboard boxes
 full of three pizzas.

13:18.197 --> 13:19.664
 That's six layers of cardboard.

13:19.665 --> 13:21.099
 That's a lot of stuff
 to get through,

13:21.100 --> 13:23.401
 but something tells me --

13:23.402 --> 13:24.803
 Little bird just tells me

13:24.804 --> 13:27.472
 that it's not gonna give that
 shotgun blast much resistance.

13:27.473 --> 13:28.840
 NARRATOR:
 But that all depends

13:28.841 --> 13:31.075
 on the shotgun rounds
 you choose,

13:31.076 --> 13:33.845
 something that's mysteriously
 missing from the myth.

13:33.846 --> 13:36.614
 My guess is that he would
 have been shot with bird shot,

13:36.615 --> 13:38.183
 and that's what's in here.

13:38.184 --> 13:41.184
 It's a really fine shot --
 little, tiny BBs.

13:42.454 --> 13:45.454
 And these aren't gonna have a
 whole lot of penetrating power.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.358
 So I wouldn't be surprised

13:47.359 --> 13:49.260
 if pizza will stop them
 sooner or later.

13:49.261 --> 13:51.796
 Bird shot into three pizzas.

13:51.797 --> 13:54.797
 3, 2, 1.

 NARRATOR: Jamie bangs off
 the bird shot from 10 feet.

13:58.871 --> 14:01.871
 Dude, not a lot
 made it through that pizza box.

14:04.143 --> 14:06.978
 NARRATOR: In fact,
 only about a half-dozen BBs

14:06.979 --> 14:08.546
 made it all the way through.

14:08.547 --> 14:10.815
 I don't think we could call it
 "definitively lethal."

14:10.816 --> 14:12.116
 Dangerous, yes.

14:12.117 --> 14:14.619
 But I don't think we can
 call that a lethal hit.

14:14.620 --> 14:17.620
 Seems like this actually
 did something useful

14:18.424 --> 14:20.491
 against bird shot.

14:20.492 --> 14:21.893
 I would say so.

14:21.894 --> 14:24.028
 Another reason to love
 pepperoni pizza!

14:24.029 --> 14:27.029
 NARRATOR: And that's probably
 what the pizza guy felt, too.

14:27.266 --> 14:30.266
 But what about if a badass
 shot buckshot, not bird shot?

14:31.337 --> 14:34.205
 These are effectively like
 plain-old bullets,

14:34.206 --> 14:36.875
 and they'll penetrate
 quite well.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.876
 Buckshot in 3.. .2... 1.

14:42.615 --> 14:44.182
 ADAM: Dude!

14:44.183 --> 14:47.018
 NARRATOR: So, how did
 the buckshot stack up?

14:47.019 --> 14:50.019
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

14:51.156 --> 14:54.156
 Almost all of them, if not
 all of them, made it through.

14:54.159 --> 14:56.461
 ADAM: Yeah.

14:56.462 --> 14:59.063
 NARRATOR: With the buckshot
 penetrating with ease,

14:59.064 --> 15:02.064
 the Mythbusters can't help but
 take this one to the extreme.

15:03.135 --> 15:05.970
 Both Jamie and I
 are now compelled to answer

15:05.971 --> 15:07.405
 the following burning question,

15:07.406 --> 15:10.208
 which is,
 how many pizzas does it take

15:10.209 --> 15:13.209
 to attain something that is
 totally resistant to buckshot?

15:14.046 --> 15:16.948
 And that's
 what we're about to answer.

15:16.949 --> 15:18.082
 NARRATOR:
 Call it random,

15:18.083 --> 15:21.083
 but they pit 15 pizzas
 in five warmer packs

15:21.854 --> 15:24.422
 against a nine-pellet
 buckshot blast.

 NARRATOR:
 And what do you know?

15:39.838 --> 15:42.838
 The buckshot cleared the crusts
 clean through to box number 5.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.210
 [ Laughs ]

15:46.211 --> 15:48.046
 It didn't make it
 through the back.

15:48.047 --> 15:49.847
 Wait!
 We got to open this up.

15:49.848 --> 15:51.082
 Pizza number 14.

 Oh! It stopped.

15:52.851 --> 15:54.519

 So it kind of worked.

15:56.255 --> 15:59.255
 The buckshot stopped
 at pizza number 14.

15:59.692 --> 16:02.692
 But would it sell
 as a bulletproof vest?

 Oh, check out

16:17.042 --> 16:19.510
 if you can cuff your way
 out of a coffin.

 from martial-arts expert

 next, the team needs a casket.

16:25.684 --> 16:28.684

16:28.954 --> 16:30.655
 I'm gonna make it
 as realistic as possible,

16:30.656 --> 16:32.123
 so I'm gonna use
 all the same materials,

16:32.124 --> 16:33.391
 I'm gonna make it
 all the same size,

 for ourselves if we can

 It's 3/4-inch pine

 and movie specifications

 Then there's the gravesite.

16:46.472 --> 16:48.539
 That's Tory's contribution.

 TORY: So I've come up with
 a design to test this safely.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.176
 What I'm gonna do
 is build a box

16:52.177 --> 16:54.345
 that will hold
 the six feet of dirt.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.981
 And then what I'm gonna do
 is raise that up off the ground

16:56.982 --> 16:59.283
 four feet with steel legs.

16:59.284 --> 17:01.019
 And then what I'm gonna do
 is put the casket

17:01.020 --> 17:02.987
 underneath that box.

17:02.988 --> 17:05.757
 Once I have the casket in,
 we have the dirt in place,

 whether or not it's possible

 to break through the casket and
 dig through six feet of dirt.

17:11.696 --> 17:14.499

 because right now,

17:14.500 --> 17:16.501
 it's onto the punch itself.

17:16.502 --> 17:19.502
 With Jon Fitch unavailable,
 that's down to Grant,

 and no prizes
 for guessing his design.

17:23.008 --> 17:25.542
 That's right.
 I'm gonna build a robot.

17:25.544 --> 17:26.810
 Using the robot,

17:26.811 --> 17:29.013
 we'll match it
 to Jon Fitch's punching strength

17:29.014 --> 17:31.716
 and then try and punch
 through the coffin lid.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.818

 to the wonder of editing,

17:33.819 --> 17:36.819

 a fearful cuffin'.

17:45.731 --> 17:48.499
 I think it's working!

 NARRATOR: And that means
 "Robofist" is ready for a test.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.738
 And I'm just gonna
 dial up the pressure

17:53.739 --> 17:56.739
 until the robot can punch
 as hard as Jon Fitch.

17:57.543 --> 18:00.543
 NARRATOR: Remember, even with
 a tiny three-inch punch,

18:00.813 --> 18:03.813
 Jon Fitch managed
 a whopping 1 ,400-pound wallop.

18:04.483 --> 18:07.483
 Grant is going to have to
 match that exactly.

18:08.253 --> 18:11.253
 Grant gets things rolling
 just short of 200 psi.

18:12.624 --> 18:14.225

 NARRATOR:
 And what do you know?

18:19.131 --> 18:22.131
 You beauty!

18:22.234 --> 18:25.234
 So, at 185 psi, the robot
 is punching at 1 ,430 pounds,

18:27.372 --> 18:30.372
 which is exactly the range
 that Jon Fitch can punch.

18:30.509 --> 18:33.010
 And it's punching
 at the right speed.

18:33.011 --> 18:36.011
 So now it's time
 to bring in a casket

18:36.148 --> 18:39.148

 does against that.

 is there a shape or size

18:51.196 --> 18:53.598
 that could render
 someone bulletproof --

18:53.599 --> 18:56.334
 i.e., could someone provide
 enough fatty tissue

18:56.335 --> 18:58.035
 or muscle tissue
 to where a bullet

18:58.036 --> 19:00.238
 wouldn't get
 to their vital organs?

19:00.239 --> 19:02.940
 I don't know why,
 but that's kind of twisted.

19:02.941 --> 19:04.942
 -Which means you like it.
 -Yeah.

19:04.943 --> 19:07.943
 All right.
 Back to the range!

19:09.181 --> 19:12.181
 NARRATOR: People come in
 all sorts of shapes and sizes,

19:12.651 --> 19:15.651
 but can you ever be so big,
 be it muscly or obese,

19:16.722 --> 19:19.722
 that you can be bulletproof?

19:20.526 --> 19:23.526
 Well, back at the range, knowing
 Jamie's fondness for lard,

19:24.263 --> 19:26.864
 the boys are starting with fat.

19:26.865 --> 19:29.865
 That is what is in your gut.

19:30.068 --> 19:33.004
 NARRATOR: Actually, Adam,
 it's what's in a cow's gut --

19:33.005 --> 19:35.039
 pure bovine blubber.

19:35.040 --> 19:36.240
 Oh, yeah.

19:36.241 --> 19:38.109
 NARRATOR: To be
 at the correct consistency,

19:38.110 --> 19:40.945
 the fat needs to be
 at human body temperature

19:40.946 --> 19:42.513
 of 98 degrees.

19:42.514 --> 19:45.514
 So, first up,
 it gets a nice, warm bath.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.852
 That is wrong.

19:47.853 --> 19:50.853
 NARRATOR: But how much fat might
 they need to stop a bullet?

19:52.958 --> 19:55.693
 The record
 for the greatest gut ever

19:55.694 --> 19:57.762
 was awarded to Walter Hudson,

19:57.763 --> 20:00.763
 who had a ginormous girth
 of nearly 10 feet.

20:01.466 --> 20:04.466
 That equates
 to a layer of 16 inches of fat

20:04.937 --> 20:06.237
 right 'round his belly.

20:06.238 --> 20:09.238
 So that's the number to beat.

20:10.075 --> 20:12.243
 You ready to pack some fat?

20:12.244 --> 20:14.612
 [ Sighs ] I don't like
 the sound of that.

20:14.613 --> 20:17.415
 NARRATOR: With no time
 to "chew the fat,"

20:17.416 --> 20:20.416
 the boys load the 16 inches
 of lard into the dummy's tummy

20:21.286 --> 20:23.421
 to replicate Walter's waistline.

20:23.422 --> 20:25.623
 Now you're gonna need
 all the fat for this recipe,

20:25.624 --> 20:28.426
 so don't lick the mixing spoon.

20:28.427 --> 20:31.329
 NARRATOR: The acrylic tube
 of fat represents belly.

20:31.330 --> 20:34.330
 The tube of ballistics gel
 represents vital organs.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.801
 For fat to be
 an effective bullet stopper,

20:36.802 --> 20:38.102
 it's gonna have to be stopped

20:38.103 --> 20:40.004
 before it makes it through
 all of this fat,

20:40.005 --> 20:42.740
 into the ballistics gel
 in the torso here.

20:42.741 --> 20:44.075
 Is it gonna actually do that?

20:44.076 --> 20:47.076
 My guess is, it might
 actually make it through.

20:47.212 --> 20:49.046
 NARRATOR:
 And they're starting slow

20:49.047 --> 20:52.047
 by using a .45 handgun that
 fires at just 900 feet a second.

20:54.019 --> 20:56.554
 Which means, if this makes it
 all the way through

20:56.555 --> 20:57.922
 our fat and vital organs,

20:57.923 --> 21:00.923
 every other kind of round
 we could fire would, as well.

21:01.226 --> 21:04.061
 NARRATOR: In other words, if
 the world-record amount of fat

21:04.062 --> 21:07.062
 can't foil the slowest slug,
 it's mayday for the myth.

21:08.066 --> 21:10.334
 Eyes and ears!
 Clear to fire.

21:10.335 --> 21:12.937
 Firing in 3...

21:12.938 --> 21:15.239
 2... 1.

21:15.240 --> 21:17.174
 [ Gunshot ]

21:17.175 --> 21:19.877
 Well, nice, clean center hit.

21:19.878 --> 21:21.445
 Ah!

21:21.446 --> 21:23.247
 It made it all the way through.

21:23.248 --> 21:25.549
 So not only did the fat
 not stop it,

21:25.550 --> 21:27.418
 the internal organs
 didn't either.

21:27.419 --> 21:28.719
 -lt went right out his back...
 -No.

21:28.720 --> 21:30.688
...and kept on going.

21:30.689 --> 21:32.023
 NARRATOR:
 So there you have it --

21:32.024 --> 21:34.625
 the idea that an obese human
 is carrying

21:34.626 --> 21:37.626
 a homegrown bulletproof vest
 is blown away.

21:38.297 --> 21:41.297
 So, the question --
 will fat stop a bullet?

21:41.300 --> 21:44.300
 Sure, eventually,
 but not in anything human.

21:45.237 --> 21:48.237
 NARRATOR: So Adam and Jamie
 move on to a more meaty medium.

21:48.940 --> 21:51.242
 Our stunt double
 for muscle today

21:51.243 --> 21:54.243
 is going to be what's called
 knuckle meat, or top round,

21:54.346 --> 21:57.346
 and it comes from
 the rump of a cow.

21:57.983 --> 22:00.685
 NARRATOR: And how much rump
 is on the table?

22:00.686 --> 22:03.686
 We found a guy with pectorals
 that were three inches thick

22:05.424 --> 22:07.692
 and biceps
 that were 11 inches thick.

22:07.693 --> 22:10.594
 And then we posited, what if you
 were shooting at him,

22:10.595 --> 22:13.164
 and what if he then took
 that massive bicep,

22:13.165 --> 22:15.366
 put it in front
 of that massive pectoral

22:15.367 --> 22:18.367
 and became
 superhumanly bulletproof?

22:20.238 --> 22:22.340
 NARRATOR:
 It's true that body builders,

22:22.341 --> 22:25.341
 with all that rippling muscle,
 sure look tough.

22:26.311 --> 22:29.013
 But are they tough enough
 to stop a bullet?

22:29.014 --> 22:32.014
 Firing into muscle
 with .45 caliber,

22:32.217 --> 22:35.217
 in 3.. .2... 1.

22:36.254 --> 22:38.522
 NARRATOR: The bullet made
 a neat entry hole.

22:38.523 --> 22:40.591
 But did the muscle man make it?

22:40.592 --> 22:43.461
 Dude, check it out.
 When I move it...

22:43.462 --> 22:45.296
 JAMIE: Yeah, I can see it
 clear as day.

22:45.297 --> 22:47.298
 That's an exit hole.

22:47.299 --> 22:49.600
 That it is.

22:49.601 --> 22:52.601
 NARRATOR: Yep, sure enough,
 it too is busted.

22:54.000 --> 23:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

23:01.513 --> 23:03.881
 Back at M7,
 Kari, Grant, and Tory

23:03.882 --> 23:05.883
 have built a robot to punch

23:05.884 --> 23:08.884
 with the power of
 martial-arts expert Jon Fitch.

23:09.521 --> 23:12.521
 Now it's time to test
 the "Kill Bill" myth --

23:12.791 --> 23:15.791
 can you really punch your way
 out of a pine box?

23:16.061 --> 23:19.061
 The team lays
 the Robofist to rest...

23:19.164 --> 23:20.998
 This is how they do it
 in Hollywood, Kari.

23:20.999 --> 23:22.767
 Ah!
 That's got to hurt.

23:22.768 --> 23:24.335
 NARRATOR:
...nails down the lid,

23:24.336 --> 23:27.336
 and they're ready for
 a dirt-free preliminary test.

23:27.939 --> 23:29.673
 Now, sharp-eyed viewers may note

23:29.674 --> 23:32.443
 that there's no dirt
 on top of our casket.

23:32.444 --> 23:35.444
 But right now, we're just trying
 to isolate the casket

23:35.447 --> 23:37.581
 and see whether, in theory,

23:37.582 --> 23:39.583
 it's possible
 to punch your way through.

23:39.584 --> 23:41.619
 NARRATOR:
 Meanwhile, Kari's worked out

23:41.620 --> 23:44.620
 the correct punch-to-air ratio
 if you get buried alive.

23:45.390 --> 23:47.124
 After about 45 minutes,

23:47.125 --> 23:48.826
 you're gonna lose air
 inside your casket

23:48.827 --> 23:50.261
 and you're gonna pass out.

23:50.262 --> 23:53.262
 Now, Jon Fitch says that he can
 punch about 20 times per minute.

23:53.398 --> 23:55.633
 So we figure the parameters
 for our myth should be set

23:55.634 --> 23:57.835
 at about half an hour,
 or 600 punches.

23:57.836 --> 24:00.805
 If you can't get out
 after 600 punches,

24:00.806 --> 24:03.207
 well, you might not be
 getting out.

24:03.208 --> 24:04.675
 -Okay, you guys ready?
 -Yeah.

24:04.676 --> 24:05.676
 -Ready.
 -Break him out.

24:05.677 --> 24:08.379
 NARRATOR: So Robofist
 comes out swinging.

24:08.380 --> 24:10.948
 -Oh!
 -Oh! Wow!

24:10.949 --> 24:12.750
 NARRATOR:
 And almost immediately,

24:12.751 --> 24:14.685
 cracks start to appear.

24:14.686 --> 24:17.421
 He's alive!

24:17.422 --> 24:19.690
 NARRATOR:
 Yep, the lid is split.

24:19.691 --> 24:21.492
 Punch through!

24:21.493 --> 24:23.060
 NARRATOR:
 But progress is, should we say,

24:23.061 --> 24:26.061
 not exactly progressing.

24:26.364 --> 24:27.531
 That crack looks like
 it's wider.

24:27.532 --> 24:28.532
 Kind of.

24:28.533 --> 24:30.701
 NARRATOR:
 300 punches on

24:30.702 --> 24:33.702
 and Tory, for one,
 is losing focus.

24:34.840 --> 24:35.906
 Tails.

24:35.907 --> 24:37.107
 NARRATOR:
 But after 30 minutes,

24:37.108 --> 24:40.108
 the coffin puncher
 would be on his last legs,

24:40.245 --> 24:43.245
 so to speak,
 with very little air left.

24:43.248 --> 24:46.217
 So Kari rings the bell
 on the final round.

24:46.218 --> 24:47.351
 [ Bell dings ]

24:47.352 --> 24:50.352
 600 punches, and it still
 didn't punch its way out.

24:50.822 --> 24:53.557
 NARRATOR: Yep,
 the casket cracked, all right,

24:53.558 --> 24:56.558
 but even without dirt on top,
 Robofist couldn't break through.

24:58.697 --> 24:59.830
 The robot worked great.

24:59.831 --> 25:02.566
 However, we were not able to
 punch through the casket,

25:02.567 --> 25:05.567
 and that is 600 punches
 at full strength the whole time.

25:06.972 --> 25:09.773
 A person probably would
 get tired if they were in there.

25:09.774 --> 25:11.342
 They would be
 running out of oxygen.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.310
 The robot didn't have
 any of those limitations,

25:13.311 --> 25:16.311
 and it still wasn't able to
 break through the casket top.

25:17.015 --> 25:20.015
 NARRATOR: But all is not lost
 because for test 2,

25:20.452 --> 25:22.786
 the guys are going to
 get down and dirty.

25:22.787 --> 25:25.787
 They're going to bury the casket
 six feet under,

25:25.891 --> 25:28.891
 and that might just give them
 the cracking they're after.

25:29.728 --> 25:32.728
 Their coffin is eight feet long,
 three feet wide,

25:33.365 --> 25:35.766
 and will be buried
 six feet deep.

25:35.767 --> 25:38.767
 That means it's covered
 with over 12,000 pounds of dirt.

25:39.671 --> 25:42.373
 This extra pressure
 may do nothing at all.

25:42.374 --> 25:45.374
 But it could create
 such a serious strain on the lid

25:45.477 --> 25:47.978
 that it's actually easier
 to break through.

25:47.979 --> 25:50.748
 So, bring on
 Tory's masterpiece --

25:50.749 --> 25:53.749
 a mobile graveyard with a box on
 top to house six feet of dirt,

25:55.887 --> 25:58.822
 and the casket
 fits snug underneath.

25:58.823 --> 26:01.823
 Tory's rig right there,
 with a coffin six feet under,

26:02.427 --> 26:05.427
 with a pallet of 4x8 dirt,

26:05.730 --> 26:08.730
 will give you between 12,000 and
 16,000 pounds, approximately,

26:10.502 --> 26:13.502
 all resting on a lid
 made of 3/4-inch pine.

26:15.140 --> 26:17.207
 NARRATOR:
 And your prediction, Kari?

26:17.208 --> 26:18.909
 I think you might be able to
 punch your way out.

26:18.910 --> 26:21.045
 I just think you're gonna die
 once it happens.

26:21.046 --> 26:23.113
 NARRATOR:
 And on that cheery thought,

26:23.114 --> 26:25.282
 Grant gets things cracking.

26:25.283 --> 26:26.383
 GRANT:
 Here we go!

26:26.384 --> 26:29.384
 3.. .2... 1.

26:29.721 --> 26:32.721
 TORY: Look at it. It's already
 starting to crack the lid.

26:34.392 --> 26:36.160
 NARRATOR:
 Just like last time,

26:36.161 --> 26:38.596
 Robofist immediately starts
 lifting the lid.

26:38.597 --> 26:41.597
 But will it be able to
 punch a hole clean through?

26:42.834 --> 26:44.435
 That's 150 punches.

26:44.436 --> 26:46.604
 He still hasn't broken through.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.539
 You wouldn't be able to
 punch that many times.

26:48.540 --> 26:50.841
 You would have run out of oxygen
 way before this.

26:50.842 --> 26:53.842
 And your wrists would be broken,
 your knuckles would be bloody.

26:54.346 --> 26:56.480
 NARRATOR:
 But also, just like last time,

26:56.481 --> 26:59.481
 the initial splits do not
 turn into escapable cracks,

27:00.585 --> 27:02.953
 even after 600 punches.

27:02.954 --> 27:05.089
 Well, the coffin lid
 cracked a little bit.

27:05.090 --> 27:07.124
 -But it didn't cave in.
 -I know.

27:07.125 --> 27:10.125
 This is not looking good for
 this myth. It's looking busted.

27:10.261 --> 27:11.328
 I was thinking.

27:11.329 --> 27:12.696
 Uh-oh.

27:12.697 --> 27:14.064
 Yeah.

27:14.065 --> 27:15.532
 I was thinking that we've got

27:15.533 --> 27:17.434
 so much stuff
 laying around this shop

27:17.435 --> 27:19.136
 that we could
 roust something up

27:19.137 --> 27:21.071
 that is not terribly exotic

27:21.072 --> 27:23.440
 that we can make
 bulletproof armor out of.

27:23.441 --> 27:25.976
 Homegrown bulletproof.

27:25.977 --> 27:27.311
 I love that!

27:27.312 --> 27:28.812
 You've already
 got some ideas, I'll bet.

27:28.813 --> 27:29.713
 Oh, yeah.

27:29.714 --> 27:31.715
 I reckon I could
 come up with something.

27:31.716 --> 27:32.716
 Let's do it!

27:32.717 --> 27:34.918
 NARRATOR: So with their myths
 checked off,

27:34.919 --> 27:36.720
 Jamie has issued a challenge --

27:36.721 --> 27:39.456
 can the Mythbusters
 build a slug stopper

27:39.457 --> 27:41.325
 out of everyday materials?

27:41.326 --> 27:44.326
 Well, first up is Adam,
 and he reaches straight for...

27:45.163 --> 27:46.730
 uh, custard?

27:46.731 --> 27:48.599
 This is just
 cornstarch and water,

27:48.600 --> 27:50.668
 and it's known
 in science circles

27:50.669 --> 27:52.236
 as a non-Newtonian fluid,

27:52.237 --> 27:55.237
 and I'm thinking its property
 of acting sometimes like a solid

27:56.841 --> 27:58.976
 and sometimes like a liquid...

27:58.977 --> 28:01.045
 NARRATOR:
 As illustrated to perfection

28:01.046 --> 28:02.746
 in the "Ninja Special."

28:02.747 --> 28:05.582
 When Adam-san
 jumped on the cornstarch,

28:05.583 --> 28:08.583
 it immediately hardened,
 so it supported his weight.

28:09.120 --> 28:11.755
 When he stood still,
 he sank like a stone.

28:11.756 --> 28:14.756
 But will it be strong enough
 and act fast enough

28:15.393 --> 28:16.994
 to stop a bullet?

28:16.995 --> 28:18.796
 Meanwhile in the other corner,

28:18.797 --> 28:21.797
 Jamie's foregone custard
 and focused on soda.

28:22.567 --> 28:24.368
 Well, the can, at least.

28:24.369 --> 28:26.870
 What I'm noticing
 as I crush this can is

28:26.871 --> 28:29.871
 that it's getting
 progressively more resistant

28:30.141 --> 28:31.275
 to me crushing it.

28:31.276 --> 28:33.644
 NARRATOR:
 So, by crushing it to the max,

28:33.645 --> 28:35.479
 will it roadblock a round?

28:35.480 --> 28:37.881
 I don't really think it's
 gonna stop a bullet by itself,

 but what if I have
 a whole bunch of them?

 Can the custard cut the mustard?

28:54.766 --> 28:57.701
 Oh, it definitely
 went through the aluminum.

28:57.702 --> 29:00.702
 One layer is clearly not enough.

29:02.373 --> 29:05.373
 NARRATOR: Having beaten his
 aluminum cans into submission,

29:05.744 --> 29:08.744
 Jamie adds a dash
 of home-brewed glue to the mix,

29:09.514 --> 29:12.514
 known domestically
 as FGR-95 cement.

29:13.218 --> 29:14.985
 JAMIE:
 Okay, that's one down.

29:14.986 --> 29:17.986
 That's FGR-95 and propylene
 fiber with aluminum cubes.

29:20.291 --> 29:22.459
 NARRATOR:
 Adam amps up his testing.

29:22.460 --> 29:25.362
 It's now a two-custard cluster
 to fire at.

29:29.501 --> 29:32.501
 Two layers still doesn't
 look like enough.

 NARRATOR: Meanwhile,
 Jamie's ready to point the Glock

29:35.874 --> 29:37.574

 right in the face of it.

 There it is.

29:53.358 --> 29:55.859
 NARRATOR:
 So, Jamie's first prototype

29:55.860 --> 29:58.860
 has left him feeling pumped,
 while Adam is feeling pressure.

29:59.831 --> 30:02.831
 In desperation, he maxes his mix
 up to six layers of custard.

 Jamie's testing has now shown

30:30.228 --> 30:32.362
 that cement with fiber and cans

30:32.363 --> 30:34.131
 is okay at stopping
 a 9-millimeter.

30:34.132 --> 30:37.132
 It collapsed the aluminum,
 but it did not make it through.

30:37.368 --> 30:38.902

 But he wants more,

30:38.903 --> 30:41.903
 and a sudden
 restroom-renovation revelation

30:42.540 --> 30:44.041
 delivers the solution.

 Even though I'm kind of attached
 to my recycled aluminum cans,

30:47.612 --> 30:49.546
 I'm gonna try these tiles.

 they might break up a bullet,

 NARRATOR: Tory, Grant,
 and Kari have found that

31:30.355 --> 31:33.355
 trying to clout your way out
 of a casket "Kill Bill" style

31:33.958 --> 31:35.926
 ain't all it's cracked up to be.

31:35.927 --> 31:38.927
 But as a potential final nail
 in this myth's coffin,

31:39.831 --> 31:42.065
 there is one last part to test.

31:42.066 --> 31:43.233
 We've busted
 the part of the myth

31:43.234 --> 31:44.735
 where you can punch
 through a casket.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.904
 But now we're gonna
 test the part of the myth

31:46.905 --> 31:48.772
 that if you did
 bust through the casket,

31:48.773 --> 31:50.707
 could you dig
 through six feet of dirt?

31:50.708 --> 31:53.708
 So what I need to do is, I need
 to reconfigure this rig here

31:53.845 --> 31:55.646
 so that we can get inside of it

31:55.647 --> 31:58.647
 and safely
 try to dig our way out.

31:59.083 --> 32:01.952
 NARRATOR: Now, if the movie
 heroine was superhuman

32:01.953 --> 32:04.588
 or the coffin lid
 riddled with woodworm,

32:04.589 --> 32:06.556
 maybe she could have
 punched through.

32:06.557 --> 32:09.557
 And if so,
 could she then have escaped?

32:09.661 --> 32:11.128
 To find out,

32:11.129 --> 32:14.129
 Tory replaces the casket lid
 with a sliding hatch

32:14.365 --> 32:16.733
 to hold back the dirt above.

32:16.734 --> 32:19.136
 All right,
 so this is the trapdoor.

32:19.137 --> 32:20.337
 It's gonna open like that,

32:20.338 --> 32:23.338
 and then we'll start
 digging our way out.

32:23.408 --> 32:25.309
 NARRATOR: He's also built
 an acrylic casket,

32:25.310 --> 32:27.711

 escape hatch

32:27.712 --> 32:30.113
 that's all ready
 for a trial run.

 So, the new casket's in place,
 and what I'm gonna do right now

32:32.617 --> 32:35.617
 is just test the trapdoor
 and see if it's working.

 It works.

 Well... sort of safely.

 Better than... dying.

 NARRATOR: Meanwhile,
 Grant's got the dirt on dirt.

32:52.203 --> 32:55.203
 So dirt weighs between
 65 and 88 pounds per cubic foot,

32:56.007 --> 32:58.442
 and we know from our
 "buried in the sand" experiment

32:58.443 --> 33:00.811
 that those types of pressures
 on your chest cavity

33:00.812 --> 33:02.879
 can get very dangerous
 very quick.

33:02.880 --> 33:05.880
 Now, traditionally, caskets
 are buried six feet under dirt.

33:07.251 --> 33:10.251
 But, for safety, we're gonna
 start out with just two feet.

33:11.389 --> 33:13.056
 NARRATOR:
 But even only two feet under,

33:13.057 --> 33:16.057
 Kari, for one, is sure
 Tory is digging his own grave.

33:17.695 --> 33:19.296
 I have a feeling
 the coffin's gonna fill up

33:19.297 --> 33:21.965
 and pin him before he's able
 to dig his way out.

33:21.966 --> 33:24.234
 NARRATOR: So, pepped up
 by Kari's confidence,

33:24.235 --> 33:26.803
 Tory puts on
 an anti-crush suit...

33:26.804 --> 33:29.506

 from compressing my lungs.

 later, and it's "go" time.

33:39.550 --> 33:40.984
 Be careful in there.

33:40.985 --> 33:43.985
 NARRATOR: Tory carefully
 slides his way into the coffin

 put his life on the line.

 this seems like a horrible idea.

 Tory's burial ritual begins.

33:56.768 --> 33:58.702
 Kari releases the trapdoor,

33:58.703 --> 34:01.703
 exactly as if he'd been able to
 punch a hole in that coffin lid.

34:02.707 --> 34:05.707
 The trickle of dirt
 begins to fall in on him.

34:08.946 --> 34:11.348
 Okay, keep going.
 Yeah, keep going.

34:11.349 --> 34:13.116
 NARRATOR:
 Kari opens it wider,

34:13.117 --> 34:15.284
 and it rapidly
 becomes an avalanche,

34:15.286 --> 34:17.621
 and it's panic stations below.

34:26.998 --> 34:28.831
 I'm all right.

34:28.833 --> 34:31.400
 NARRATOR: The two feet of dirt
 has caved in on him,

34:31.402 --> 34:32.735
 but there's a bonus.

34:32.737 --> 34:35.605
 It's opened up
 a rabbit hole above.

 TORY:

34:40.078 --> 34:42.512
 NARRATOR:
 But still trapped,

34:42.513 --> 34:45.513
 he pushes the dirt
 to the bottom of the coffin,

34:46.016 --> 34:49.016
 wriggles, and then
 scrapes his way upright,

34:49.353 --> 34:50.821
 and with a massive effort,

34:50.822 --> 34:53.822
 actually triumphs
 in tunneling his way out.

 Ahh!

34:57.295 --> 34:59.062
 I'm alive!

34:59.063 --> 35:01.531
 NARRATOR: Tory has proved
 that at two feet under,

35:01.532 --> 35:04.034
 assuming you could
 open the coffin lid,

35:04.035 --> 35:06.736
 escape is just conceivable.

35:06.737 --> 35:09.737
 But the myth
 calls for a normal burial.

35:09.841 --> 35:12.841
 Now, our next setup is gonna be
 under the full six feet of dirt.

35:14.145 --> 35:15.812
 NARRATOR:
 Yep, you heard right, folks --

35:15.813 --> 35:18.813
 Grant is going to be buried
 a full six feet under.

35:19.450 --> 35:22.450
 But, so he doesn't die,
 his plan is to sit up,

35:22.887 --> 35:24.888
 not lie down, in the coffin.

35:24.889 --> 35:27.791
 Okay, let's pause
 for Kari's prediction.

35:27.792 --> 35:30.792
 I think about four feet,
 it's all gonna collapse down

35:30.928 --> 35:32.729
 and completely go pear-shaped.

35:32.730 --> 35:34.965
 GRANT:
 Okay, Kari, go ahead.

35:34.966 --> 35:37.834
 NARRATOR: Kari at last
 "dishes the dirt" on Grant.

35:37.835 --> 35:40.704
 GRANT:
 Keep going.

35:40.705 --> 35:43.705
 NARRATOR: Thousands of pounds
 of soil slither south.

35:43.975 --> 35:45.342
 Okay, stop! Stop!

35:45.343 --> 35:46.643
 NARRATOR:
 And almost immediately,

35:46.644 --> 35:49.446
 Grant is buried to the neck,
 unable to move,

35:49.447 --> 35:52.447
 at least until the rig breaks
 under the pressure.

35:52.817 --> 35:55.817
 It's easy to see that
 if Grant had been lying down,

35:56.120 --> 35:57.587
 he'd be dead.

35:57.588 --> 36:00.588
 Well, I guess that worked well.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.994
 Yeah, I think
 that pretty much sums it up.

36:03.995 --> 36:06.530
 NARRATOR:
 The air tunnel that Tory used

36:06.531 --> 36:08.431
 never opened up for Grant,

36:08.432 --> 36:11.432
 and that meant
 escape was totally impossible.

36:11.903 --> 36:14.903
 NARRATOR: So let's go inside and
 put the epitaph on this myth.

36:15.873 --> 36:18.141
 All right, you guys, where do
 we stand with coffin punch?

36:18.142 --> 36:19.676
 We definitely have to
 bust this one.

36:19.677 --> 36:21.278
 There's no way we were even able

36:21.279 --> 36:22.879
 to punch through the lid
 of the casket,

36:22.880 --> 36:25.081
 and that's with the full
 strength of the martial artist,

36:25.082 --> 36:28.082
 both in the shop
 and when the casket was buried.

36:28.119 --> 36:30.287
 Say you could punch a hole
 in the casket and you could

36:30.288 --> 36:32.355
 punch that hole big enough
 that you could crawl out of,

36:32.356 --> 36:34.257
 there's no way you're crawling
 through six feet of dirt.

36:34.258 --> 36:35.825
 Look how much trouble you had
 with two feet.

36:35.826 --> 36:38.161
 And I had a mask on
 and a respirator.

36:38.162 --> 36:39.529
 Yeah, if you didn't have that,

36:39.530 --> 36:41.531
 you wouldn't be able to
 see or breathe.

36:41.532 --> 36:43.733
 Yeah, so this one
 is definitely busted.

36:43.734 --> 36:45.001
 -Busted.
 -Busted.

36:45.002 --> 36:48.002
 I just hope
 I never get buried alive.

36:48.105 --> 36:51.105
 Oh, that's what I was gonna
 get you for Christmas.

36:54.078 --> 36:55.512
 This is my improvised armor.

36:55.513 --> 36:58.381
 Now, it's made of
 a high-strength gypsum cement

 called FGR-95, which is filled
 with polypropylene fiber,

37:02.720 --> 37:05.720
 and we've also inserted two
 layers of common bathroom tiles

37:06.324 --> 37:08.058
 a little bit back
 from the front.

37:08.059 --> 37:11.059
 NARRATOR: With its
 gel vital organs as backstop,

37:11.062 --> 37:14.062
 the mannequin will take the hit
 if the tile proves permeable.

37:15.499 --> 37:16.833
 Well, here at
 the Mythbusters armory,

37:16.834 --> 37:19.002
 Jamie said he wanted to
 test the Jamie tile.

37:19.003 --> 37:20.637
 We wanted to give it
 a good solid test.

37:20.638 --> 37:23.638
 We chose wide bandwidth of your
 basic armaments and ammunition.

37:25.142 --> 37:27.444
 So let me give you
 a tour of today's arsenal.

37:27.445 --> 37:29.546
 Starting off with a handgun,
 9-millimeter.

37:29.547 --> 37:31.715
 Moving on to the handgun,
 .45 caliber.

37:31.716 --> 37:34.716
 Then to the shotgun, both with
 buckshot and the deer slug.

37:35.019 --> 37:37.120
 Finally, finishing off with
 the high-speed rifle round,

37:37.121 --> 37:38.822
 the .223.

37:38.823 --> 37:41.524
 That ought to give this thing
 a run for its money.

37:41.525 --> 37:43.126
 Going hot!

37:43.127 --> 37:45.528
 NARRATOR:
 And suited, locked, and loaded

37:45.529 --> 37:47.197
 for the first big test,

37:47.198 --> 37:49.299
 let's pause
 for a prediction from Jamie.

37:49.300 --> 37:52.300
 As far as pistols go, the
 9-millimeter has a reputation

37:52.303 --> 37:54.571
 for penetrating quite well.

37:54.572 --> 37:57.107
 I'm gonna go out
 on a limb here, though, and say,

37:57.108 --> 37:59.576
 I think my Jamie tile
 is gonna stop it.

37:59.577 --> 38:00.677
 [ Gun clicks ]

38:00.678 --> 38:03.678
 NARRATOR: But will confidence
 be confirmed by the conclusion?

38:04.115 --> 38:07.017
 Firing in 3...

38:07.018 --> 38:08.151
 2...

38:08.152 --> 38:10.987
 1.

38:10.988 --> 38:12.289
 It stopped it.

38:12.290 --> 38:15.025
 It totally stopped it.

38:15.026 --> 38:17.093
 -There you go.
 -JAMIE: It's a 9-millimeter.

38:17.094 --> 38:19.829
 I'd say it's Jamie tile, 1,
 bullet, 0.

38:19.830 --> 38:22.830
 NARRATOR: It's a good start
 for Jamie's tile,

38:22.967 --> 38:25.967
 but next, it's staring down
 the barrel of a .45 handgun.

38:28.372 --> 38:31.372
 ADAM:
 Oh, that looks like a nice stop.

38:31.776 --> 38:32.976
 Beauty.

38:32.977 --> 38:34.110
 Hardly a dent in the back.

38:34.111 --> 38:35.545
 [ Laughs ]

38:35.546 --> 38:38.546
 Jamie tile, 2.
 Bullets, zilch.

38:38.849 --> 38:41.251
 NARRATOR: Next up
 in the ramp-up, it's buckshot.

38:41.252 --> 38:43.320
 After watching what it did
 against the handgun rounds,

38:43.321 --> 38:46.321
 I don't think buckshot is gonna
 make it through the Jamie tile.

38:47.191 --> 38:50.026
 -[ Gunshot ]
 -Wow!

38:50.027 --> 38:53.027
 [ Laughs ]
 Look at that.

38:53.030 --> 38:54.497
 JAMIE:
 Well, I tell you what,

38:54.498 --> 38:57.233
 buckshot is one of the scariest
 things you can go up against,

38:57.234 --> 39:00.036
 and the Jamie tile stopped it,
 and it stopped it cold.

39:00.037 --> 39:02.739
 NARRATOR: But now
 things get really serious

39:02.740 --> 39:05.740
 as buckshot takes a backseat,
 replaced by the deer slug.

39:07.144 --> 39:09.379
 This is almost an ounce of lead.

39:09.380 --> 39:12.349
 It's a huge amount of force
 coming out of that gun.

39:12.350 --> 39:15.051
 I don't know whether
 we'll be able to stop it or not.

39:15.052 --> 39:18.052
 MAN: Range is hot!
 Eye and ear protection on.

39:20.624 --> 39:22.892
 [ Chuckles ]
 I see dead people.

39:22.893 --> 39:25.195
 NARRATOR:
 And the fears are founded.

39:25.196 --> 39:27.397
 ADAM:
 Wow, look at that hole!

39:27.398 --> 39:29.199
 You'd be hurting.

39:29.200 --> 39:32.200
 You'd be dead.

39:33.104 --> 39:35.772
 NARRATOR: The deer slug
 went straight through the tile

39:35.773 --> 39:38.773
 and took out
 the vital organs, too.

39:39.510 --> 39:41.745
 Oh, it looks like the champion's
 been taken down

39:41.746 --> 39:44.746
 by an upstart named "Deer Slug."

39:45.549 --> 39:47.083
 NARRATOR:
 And after the slow-moving

39:47.084 --> 39:49.252
 but deadly deer shot...

39:49.253 --> 39:51.554
 Now we're gonna
 move on to the .223.

39:51.555 --> 39:53.323
 this is the opposite end
 of the scale.

39:53.324 --> 39:56.324
 It's a really small bullet, but
 it's moving really, really fast.

39:56.427 --> 39:59.427
 NARRATOR: But can it take out
 a Jamie tile?

39:59.463 --> 40:02.463
 Range is hot!
 Eye and ears!

40:03.934 --> 40:06.636
 NARRATOR:
 And it's the last man standing.

40:06.637 --> 40:08.671
 What do you think?
 You think it went through?

40:08.672 --> 40:09.806
 JAMIE:
 I think it went through.

40:09.807 --> 40:11.141
 ADAM: You do?
 Oh, look at that.

40:11.142 --> 40:13.943
 There's the bullet.
 That would be a kill.

40:13.944 --> 40:16.379
 Wow!
 Look at that.

40:16.380 --> 40:18.548
 You certainly
 slowed that bullet down

40:18.549 --> 40:21.549
 for it to end up in the gel,
 but he's dead.

40:25.756 --> 40:28.756
 NARRATOR: And there's no arguing
 with that.

40:28.759 --> 40:31.094
 [ German accent ] Well, it seems
 that the halcyon days

40:31.095 --> 40:33.263
 where we all wished
 the Jamie tile was bulletproof

40:33.264 --> 40:34.931
 are all going to go,

40:34.932 --> 40:37.932
 for the .223
 has pierced it completely.

40:37.935 --> 40:40.935
 However, it is still
 Jamie tile, 3,

40:41.405 --> 40:44.405
 bullets and ammunition, 2.

40:46.811 --> 40:48.278
 Well, our armor
 is full of holes,

40:48.279 --> 40:49.679
 the dummy is full of holes.

40:49.680 --> 40:50.847
 I think we're done here.

40:50.848 --> 40:53.848
 I think our work is done.
 Let's go.

40:56.954 --> 40:59.589
 JAMIE: I think I need to try
 Portland cement next.
