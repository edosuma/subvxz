00:55.166 --> 00:56.083
- Yeah?

00:56.166 --> 00:57.583
- Hey, did you get my text?

00:57.667 --> 00:59.625
- Uh, I did.

00:59.709 --> 01:02.125
Essentials, is that okay?

01:02.208 --> 01:03.125
(woman sighing on the phone)
- Anything's fine.

01:03.208 --> 01:06.125
- Okay, perfect.
- Actually, no. Get, um...

Promise Ultra.
Promise Ultra.

01:09.458 --> 01:11.583
- Uh...

01:11.667 --> 01:13.375
Okay.

01:13.458 --> 01:15.250
(sighing)
You know, they say
it's normal,

01:15.333 --> 01:18.458
But I've had
some crap come out
of my vag'.

01:18.542 --> 01:20.083
That's some real sci-fi shit.

01:20.166 --> 01:24.917
- Are you trying to get me
aroused? Because if you are,
erection accomplished.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.375
- Hmm... sexy.

01:28.417 --> 01:30.583
- How is he?
- Almost out.

01:30.667 --> 01:34.208
Dear Jesus, let him be out.
(sighing)

01:34.291 --> 01:36.417
(phone chiming)
Oh, hang on.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:40.375 --> 01:43.083
Oh... what did she say?

01:43.166 --> 01:46.166
Purpose... promise!

01:46.250 --> 01:48.291
- Ken?
- Yeah.

01:48.375 --> 01:51.500
- That was your mom.

01:51.583 --> 01:53.208
It's your dad.

01:54.750 --> 01:57.166
- Why would my mom be...

01:57.250 --> 02:00.375
(rock music)

02:05.458 --> 02:08.709
Okay, Mom.
Alright, me too.

02:08.792 --> 02:10.834
Bye.

02:10.917 --> 02:13.583
- Did she say what happened?

02:13.667 --> 02:15.709
(sighing)

02:15.792 --> 02:18.417
- Yeah, he has a... aneurysm.

02:20.667 --> 02:23.333
(sighing)

02:23.417 --> 02:24.542
- Ah!
- Oh, sorry.

02:24.625 --> 02:26.375
(moaning)
Boobs.

02:27.250 --> 02:29.417
- Do aneurysms hurt?

02:29.500 --> 02:32.333
- I have no idea.

02:33.542 --> 02:35.542
- You didn't pump?

02:35.625 --> 02:39.375
- I fell asleep with the milker
in my hand like some
narcoleptic cow.

02:39.458 --> 02:40.875
- That was my band's name
in high school.

02:40.959 --> 02:43.458
The Narcoleptic Cows.

02:44.542 --> 02:45.792
- I know you didn't talk much.
(sniffing)

02:45.875 --> 02:47.750
(Ken scoffing)

02:47.834 --> 02:50.625
- Or ever.

02:53.542 --> 02:54.834
(moaning)

02:55.959 --> 02:58.792
You think I should go?

03:00.667 --> 03:02.625
- To your dad's funeral?

03:05.417 --> 03:07.583
Your... your dad's funeral.

03:07.667 --> 03:10.500
- I know, but I mean, it's a
last-minute plane ticket and--

03:10.583 --> 03:13.500
- Who gives a fuck? It's your
dad! It's your dad's funeral!

03:13.583 --> 03:17.542
Yeah, you have to go!
What are you, dead inside?!

03:17.625 --> 03:18.917
(sobbing)

03:19.000 --> 03:22.250
- Oh, hey, hey, hey...

03:22.333 --> 03:24.417
It's alright.

03:24.500 --> 03:26.333
- It's these fucking hormones.

03:28.875 --> 03:32.291
Is your mom gonna go?
- Um...

03:32.375 --> 03:36.458
I don't know. She doesn't
really go anywhere.

03:37.959 --> 03:40.875
- Promise me we'll never get
divorced!

03:42.250 --> 03:46.500
- It's a big ask, sweetie.
- Promise me and when I die,

03:46.583 --> 03:51.417
you fucking make our son go
to my funeral, even if I was
the worst mom in the world!

03:52.291 --> 03:55.583
- There are a lot of
assumptions there.

03:55.667 --> 03:57.000
- Ken, you listen to me, man!

03:57.083 --> 04:00.834
I'm still as big as the house,
and my boobs feel like
cement and--

04:00.917 --> 04:03.375
- Whoa, okay, okay, I promise.
We'll go.

04:03.458 --> 04:07.333
I'll bring my hot new
girlfriend and... you know...
what's his name, in the crib?

04:11.834 --> 04:15.750
(sniffling)
- We really have to name him!

04:15.834 --> 04:18.375
Are we like
the worst parents ever?

04:20.166 --> 04:22.875
- Maybe top ten.
(laughing)

04:30.959 --> 04:34.333
- Hey...
- Mm?

04:34.917 --> 04:37.542
- Did you get diapers?

04:37.625 --> 04:39.000
- Did you ask me to get...

04:39.083 --> 04:41.875
What are you doing?

04:42.792 --> 04:46.542
- I don't know.
It's been a while and...

04:46.625 --> 04:49.333
I thought maybe this could,
uh...

04:50.083 --> 04:52.542
...cheer you up.
(zipper opening)

04:52.625 --> 04:53.792
- Oh...

04:53.875 --> 04:55.917
Are you sure?

04:58.792 --> 05:01.166
(grunting)

05:01.250 --> 05:02.583
- There...

05:05.834 --> 05:08.542
- Oh... a little cold.

05:12.542 --> 05:15.667
- Ow, no!
- Sorry. I forgot.

05:19.333 --> 05:21.208
- God, I...

05:21.291 --> 05:22.959
(yawning): ...love your dick.

05:26.417 --> 05:30.208
- Maybe we could, uh...
try something a little more fun.

05:30.291 --> 05:33.417
(baby crying)
- And time.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.583
- Wait, oh...

05:35.667 --> 05:37.667
- Would you please get that,
babe? I have to go swap out
my pad.

05:40.125 --> 05:42.709
(baby crying)
- Yeah, on it.

05:46.792 --> 05:47.709
(moaning)

05:47.792 --> 05:51.750
Okay, coming, you little...
cock-blocker.

05:56.834 --> 06:00.667
(indistinct dialogue)

06:05.417 --> 06:06.500
- Ken?!

06:09.834 --> 06:11.834
Listen, about that, um...

06:12.959 --> 06:15.709
Ah, there's the little one!

06:15.792 --> 06:19.291
Right where the corporate screen
saver should be, huh?

06:19.375 --> 06:22.917
- Yeah, I realized I didn't have
any pictures on my desk, so...

06:23.000 --> 06:26.917
- Ah, well, at least, it's not a
YouTube video of the actual
birth, am I right?

06:27.000 --> 06:28.959
(chuckling)
- I guess.

06:29.041 --> 06:31.834
- God, you know, I remember
our first...

06:31.917 --> 06:34.375
Up every 15 minutes, couldn't
get any sleep,

06:34.458 --> 06:36.333
the wife and I are at each
other's throats...

06:36.417 --> 06:38.000
- Yeah, I know
what you're saying.

06:38.083 --> 06:40.834
Sometimes, I just...
wanna hop in the car

06:40.917 --> 06:46.709
and drive till my whole life
is just a memory fading
in the rearview.

06:48.709 --> 06:51.917
- What the hell is wrong
with you?
(scoffing)

06:52.000 --> 06:54.583
Ken, this is a...
family company.

06:54.667 --> 06:57.542
- Right, no, I just thought we
were... uh...

06:58.166 --> 07:04.917
Speaking of families, would it
be okay if I took a couple of
personal days?

07:05.000 --> 07:07.709
I have a funeral.
- Oh...

07:07.792 --> 07:10.834
I'm sorry, who?
- Uh, my dad.

07:13.542 --> 07:15.667
- Bring it in here. Come on.
- What?

07:15.750 --> 07:18.875
- Come here. Come on!
- Okay...

07:18.959 --> 07:21.959
(grunting)
Okay.

07:22.917 --> 07:27.000
- What happened?
- Um... it's an aneurysm.

07:27.083 --> 07:30.500
(sighing)
- Those are awful.

07:31.750 --> 07:34.500
- Yeah, I've heard they're--
- So when do you think
you'll be back?

07:34.583 --> 07:37.375
- Um... I can probably be back
by Monday?

07:38.417 --> 07:42.125
- Oh, well, at least, you're not
gonna miss the wine and liquor
convention, right?

07:42.208 --> 07:44.875
(chuckling)

07:44.959 --> 07:47.792
God, doesn't it seem
like we just had WIZDIC
the other day?

07:47.875 --> 07:49.083
Hey, listen, how's that
PowerPoint coming?

07:49.166 --> 07:52.625
- Good, good, good. I thought
I'd just finish it on the plane.

07:52.709 --> 07:56.625
- No, no, no. You are going to
grieve on the plane.

07:56.709 --> 07:59.667
- Right.
- Of course, we do need it,
so...

07:59.750 --> 08:03.667
- Yeah. Do we need it, though?
Just...

08:03.750 --> 08:08.792
because, I feel like I...
I do one every year.

08:08.875 --> 08:12.041
And it seems like the client
never actually looks at it.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.500
(chuckling)
- And the one time you leave
your house

08:14.583 --> 08:18.542
without your spare tire...
- Is the time you get a flat.
(clicking fingers)

08:19.792 --> 08:20.709
- Alright.

08:20.792 --> 08:23.083
- So look, do we send flowers

08:23.166 --> 08:25.625
or is there some kind of
aneurysm fun run?

08:28.083 --> 08:28.959
- The flowers works.

08:31.500 --> 08:33.917
I'll see you in two whole days.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.875
- Hey, and I sent you that list
of names, just so you have it.

08:39.417 --> 08:41.625
- Alright.
- Oh, my God!

08:41.708 --> 08:43.833
You're finally throwing him
out!?

08:43.917 --> 08:48.208
- He's just going on a trip and
I'm seeing him off 1950's
housewife style.

08:48.291 --> 08:49.917
- Well, when the husband's
away...

08:50.000 --> 08:53.458
What time should I come over?
- Any time is a good time.

08:53.542 --> 08:55.667
- Okay...
- You better hurry home, Daddy.

08:57.959 --> 08:59.875
- Alright, try to get some sleep
on the plane.

08:59.959 --> 09:00.500
(taxi honking)
- I should go.

09:00.583 --> 09:03.500
- Okay.
- Love you.

09:04.041 --> 09:06.959
- Um, hello!

09:07.250 --> 09:08.709
Dad?

09:19.333 --> 09:23.208
It's fine. He's not yours
anyway! So...

09:24.834 --> 09:26.041
- Hi, are you here for Ken?

that anymore.

10:11.458 --> 10:14.250
It's not like you can miss
something that was never there
in the first place.

10:14.333 --> 10:17.709
- Don't start.
- I'm not starting.

10:17.792 --> 10:20.917
- I did the best I could.
- I wasn't talking about you.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.208
- I worked incredibly hard to
give you a good, normal home.
Don't be so sensitive.

10:25.291 --> 10:26.875
- I'm not being sensitive.

10:26.959 --> 10:28.583
- You're being defensive.

10:29.625 --> 10:31.375
So, how are the bar plans going?

10:31.458 --> 10:33.959
- Gastropub, watch out.

10:34.041 --> 10:38.000
Uh... kind of on hold.
I had a space picked out,

10:38.083 --> 10:40.875
but money's a little tight
since the baby came.

10:40.959 --> 10:44.875
- It's a shame your father never
got to meet his grandson.

10:44.959 --> 10:47.667
Dare I hope there's a name?

10:47.750 --> 10:50.000
- Working on it.
- For the love of God!

10:50.083 --> 10:53.041
- Okay, look, it's not like you
come to visit anyway.

10:53.125 --> 10:55.375
- Maybe if I were invited.
- I shouldn't...

10:55.458 --> 10:58.083
(sighing)
How about next month?

10:58.166 --> 11:00.750
- Next month?
It's our busiest time.

11:00.834 --> 11:04.125
- Ah... busiest time in office
management?

11:04.208 --> 11:06.625
- Ah, it's pre-pre tax planning
season.

11:06.709 --> 11:10.041
Plus we have two birthdays
and a retirement.

11:10.125 --> 11:12.959
Can't imagine the mess
I'd come back to.

11:13.041 --> 11:14.834
- Can't imagine.

11:17.583 --> 11:19.625
(talk radio, indistinct)

11:22.583 --> 11:24.000
- Oh!
(honking)

11:24.083 --> 11:26.542
Wow, my ex-husband is dead.

11:26.625 --> 11:27.959
Guess it's my turn next.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.959
- That's a happy thought.

11:33.750 --> 11:37.583
Are you still... seeing that guy
with the thing?

11:37.667 --> 11:38.834
What's his name? Oscar.

11:38.917 --> 11:43.041
- Oscar? No, he and his wife
moved to Florida.

11:44.667 --> 11:46.542
- Huh...
- I'm joking.

11:46.625 --> 11:49.291
He had a stroke.
Everyone's dying.

11:50.834 --> 11:54.667
(tires squealing, car honking)
- I think it might be...
- Motherfucker!

11:54.750 --> 11:55.834
So, where's the service?

11:59.333 --> 12:01.542
Or should I guess?

12:01.625 --> 12:04.333
(light music)

12:06.208 --> 12:08.667
- Welcome to Niakwa
Golf and Country.

12:08.750 --> 12:10.750
Would you like to sign
the condolence book?

12:10.834 --> 12:13.750
- Oh, uh... sure.

12:16.792 --> 12:19.000
Who gets this after?

12:19.083 --> 12:20.834
- Uh...

12:20.917 --> 12:24.709
It condoles the family.
Are you related?

12:24.792 --> 12:29.166
- I am, yeah. I'm his son.
- Dude.

12:30.041 --> 12:33.875
- Oh, thanks. It's always nice
to... hear...

12:36.041 --> 12:38.000
- Someone wanted to talk to you.

12:42.709 --> 12:44.417
Mr. Kendall?

12:49.166 --> 12:52.125
- I'm guessing you're Ken?
Andy's son, hi.

12:52.208 --> 12:56.792
Vince Kendall, your dad's
attorney and part of his
Friday foursome.

12:56.875 --> 12:58.083
- I guess not anymore, though.

12:59.750 --> 13:01.333
I don't know why I said that.

13:01.417 --> 13:02.333
- Your dad always told me about
your great sense of humour.

13:02.417 --> 13:05.041
- Oh, he did?

13:06.166 --> 13:09.834
- Hey! Why don't we go talk
in the Hazelton room?

13:10.917 --> 13:12.458
Yeah, the Hazelton room, named
after Vic Hazelton,

13:12.542 --> 13:18.208
great, great golfer, but an
even greater alcoholic.
And a mean alcoholic.

13:18.291 --> 13:20.208
- Really?
- I was afraid of him.

13:20.291 --> 13:21.250
He once killed a horse
with a 9 iron.

13:21.333 --> 13:24.041
- Well...

13:24.125 --> 13:28.166
So I assume this is about
my dad's will?

13:28.250 --> 13:31.709
- The vultures are three deep
at the bar, passed apps are
almost gone.

13:31.792 --> 13:35.959
I swear to God. Half those guys
never even met Andy, but you put
a pig in a blanket...

13:36.041 --> 13:40.083
- Ken, Jeff Stedmon. Jeff's the
executive of your dad's will.
Jeff, Ken.

13:40.166 --> 13:41.166
- Ken, nice to meet you.

13:41.250 --> 13:43.083
I'm sorry about your dad, but
if I know Andy,

13:43.166 --> 13:46.875
he's trying to dig Jesus for a
50-dollar Nassau as we speak.

13:46.959 --> 13:49.000
(laughing)
- He would do that,
wouldn't he?!

13:49.083 --> 13:53.333
"Excuse me, Mr. Christ, but
isn't that a hurricane about to
hit India?!"

13:53.959 --> 13:56.625
- Whoop! Classic Andy
foot wedge!

13:56.709 --> 13:58.208
- I have no idea
what's happening.

13:58.291 --> 13:59.750
- You need a drink.
- Uh, I'm okay.

13:59.834 --> 14:00.959
- I wasn't asking.
- Oh...

14:02.417 --> 14:05.250
- Rachel!

14:06.417 --> 14:07.625
Your dad's paying!

14:07.709 --> 14:11.083
Open bar, passed apps,
part of his last will and
testament.

14:11.166 --> 14:13.250
- First and last time he ever
bought a round.

14:13.333 --> 14:15.333
- Rachel, can you get Ken here
a little something?

14:15.417 --> 14:18.458
- Yeah, just a light beer.
- Kid, it's a wake.

14:18.542 --> 14:20.792
Bring him one of these,
freshen mine up.

14:22.333 --> 14:23.875
There's a hole in the glass.

14:25.458 --> 14:28.000
- So... shall we get down to it?

14:34.834 --> 14:37.458
- You guys do a lot of this
estate work at the golf course?

14:37.542 --> 14:39.875
- Well, business goes where
business gets done.

14:39.959 --> 14:42.166
That's why so many
Koreans are... Here we go!

14:43.625 --> 14:46.375
This is for you.

14:49.291 --> 14:50.583
- Oh... this is...

14:50.667 --> 14:53.458
- Your dad's ashes.

14:56.208 --> 14:59.125
Gentlemen, I am proud to
present...

15:00.875 --> 15:03.166
Andy Wall's final words.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.208
- It's slower than a ladies'
foursome.

15:19.291 --> 15:21.792
(Vince chuckling)

15:21.875 --> 15:26.500
- My name is Andy Wall,
and this is my last
will and testament.

15:26.583 --> 15:29.083
Do I say that? Okay.

15:29.166 --> 15:31.125
I've only one request
of my son,

15:31.208 --> 15:36.333
and that's that he scatter
my ashes in the middle of the
field at Investors Stadium.

15:36.417 --> 15:40.000
If he does this, then,
he gets everything.

15:40.083 --> 15:42.875
It's not much, but then,
when my dad passed,

15:42.959 --> 15:44.583
I got shit all, and the
government took most of that.

15:44.667 --> 15:47.083
- That's the feds for you.

15:47.166 --> 15:49.041
- Now, if he doesn't get it
done, well, then,

15:49.125 --> 15:55.041
my estate goes to the club
for the construction of a
members-only steam room,

15:55.125 --> 15:57.875
which could have been done
last fiscal,

15:57.959 --> 16:02.125
but Steve London
isn't much of an accountant,
so now, it's up to me.

16:02.208 --> 16:05.542
- Boy, do not get him started
on Steve London.

16:05.625 --> 16:08.875
- And it has to be done within
two days of my service.

16:08.959 --> 16:11.291
I don't wanna sit
on some shelf
somewhere while my son

16:11.375 --> 16:15.250
slaps his dick
around trying to
figure out what's what.

16:15.333 --> 16:16.333
(Jeff and Vince laughing)

16:16.417 --> 16:17.959
Uh, Vince has the details

16:18.041 --> 16:23.250
and Jeff'll make sure it gets
done before the money
gets handed over.

16:23.333 --> 16:25.542
Okay, that's it.

16:25.625 --> 16:29.083
Would you... go find that
oriental nurse, you know,
the one with the--

16:33.625 --> 16:36.458
- Why did he look like that?
I thought he had an aneurysm?

16:36.542 --> 16:39.959
- Well, the aneurysm was one
of the side effects of
the lung cancer.

16:40.041 --> 16:40.959
- Lung cancer?

16:41.041 --> 16:43.375
- And a lifetime of
self-medicating.

16:43.458 --> 16:45.417
- Yeah, we all thought his liver
would go first.

16:45.500 --> 16:47.417
- Yeah, he never even got
to the chemo, you know.

16:47.500 --> 16:50.083
By the time he got his saggy
ass to the doctor,

16:50.166 --> 16:52.291
he was already line seven with a
marshal up his ass.

16:52.375 --> 16:55.041
- Nothing to do but pick up
and head in...

16:55.125 --> 16:57.959
to that 19th hole in the sky.

16:58.041 --> 17:01.083
- Golf terms.
(Vince): Golf terms.
(Jeff): Mm-hmm.

17:01.166 --> 17:02.750
- Any questions?

17:02.834 --> 17:03.750
- Well, uh...
- Thanks, Rachel.

17:03.834 --> 17:06.416
- A few, yeah. Um...

17:06.500 --> 17:09.959
- We really don't amount to
much in the end, do we?

17:10.040 --> 17:14.666
- Why would... why would he want
his ashes scattered at Investors
Stadium?

17:14.750 --> 17:17.040
- It was his only request.

17:17.125 --> 17:19.040
- That and the open bar!
- And the passed apps.

17:19.125 --> 17:20.959
- And the estate...?

17:21.040 --> 17:24.000
- I'm not allowed to tell you
the amount until it's all done.

17:24.083 --> 17:28.208
- 40 years in sales. God, that
bastard knew how to incentivize.

17:31.667 --> 17:34.208
(Ken): Uh... how would I even...

17:35.125 --> 17:37.083
- Look, we're not gonna
force you.

17:37.166 --> 17:38.959
- No one's got a gun
to your head.
- This is not China.

17:39.041 --> 17:40.250
- I read a thing, when the next
generation of this country

17:40.333 --> 17:42.667
is gonna come out the chute
speaking Mandarin.

17:42.750 --> 17:45.125
- Really?
- Listen, I have...

17:45.208 --> 17:47.625
a lot of stuff on my plate
right now, uh...

17:47.709 --> 17:49.917
Could I have a little time
to think about it?

17:50.000 --> 17:51.458
- Of course, absolutely.

17:51.542 --> 17:53.750
Though we should get this show
on the road.

17:53.834 --> 17:56.000
Some mourners have
their T-times.

17:56.083 --> 17:59.458
Not that they'd walk or
anything, but your dad really
hated slow play.

17:59.542 --> 18:03.375
- "While we're young!"
- He said that a lot.
(chuckling)

18:03.458 --> 18:05.542
- Rest in peace.

18:07.417 --> 18:09.125
Shall we go?
- Yeah.

18:11.333 --> 18:14.417
- Well, I'd like to thank
everyone for coming

18:14.500 --> 18:18.375
to this celebration of life.

18:18.458 --> 18:21.250
The other day, we lost a friend,
a colleague,

18:21.333 --> 18:24.333
and a man who couldn't hit a
7-iron to save his life.

18:24.417 --> 18:26.041
(scattered laughs)

18:26.125 --> 18:29.250
So to that end, we are putting
Andy's name on a plaque,

18:29.333 --> 18:32.333
on the ball washer on Number 9,
Andy's favourite hole.

18:32.417 --> 18:34.667
- Not his favourite!
- Yeah, okay.

18:34.750 --> 18:40.166
- My fondest memory of Andy was
when he hit a wedge off a tree

18:40.250 --> 18:44.166
and it landed in that tiny
hollow where a pipe was broken.

18:44.250 --> 18:48.291
And he wanted to call it...
ground under repair.

18:48.375 --> 18:50.125
But...
(chuckling)

18:50.208 --> 18:53.291
- Serving on the logistics
committee is a thankless task.

18:53.375 --> 18:56.375
But Andy was always good about
stepping up.

18:56.458 --> 18:57.417
(phone chiming)
Oh!

18:59.709 --> 19:04.500
- The specialty ad game is more
than just logos on pens.

19:04.583 --> 19:05.375
And he knew that.

19:07.500 --> 19:09.166
He got that.

19:10.458 --> 19:14.417
- We said, "Andy, that's not
ground under repair.

19:14.500 --> 19:17.125
That's a water hazard!"

19:18.458 --> 19:23.166
- Uh... so when you see the new
compressed air spikes cleaner,

19:23.250 --> 19:26.083
you should know
Andy fought for that.

19:26.166 --> 19:30.583
Also, Spring Fling tickets
are now on sale. Thank you.

19:32.542 --> 19:34.917
- Now, some of you
may know that...

19:35.000 --> 19:38.500
Andy left behind a son.

19:38.583 --> 19:40.709
Ken.

19:40.792 --> 19:42.458
Ken, would you stand for the
people?

19:45.792 --> 19:47.750
And now, Ken's gonna
say a few words.

20:01.750 --> 20:04.250
- Hello.

20:04.333 --> 20:07.083
Uh... I didn't really
prepare anything,

20:07.166 --> 20:11.208
so I'm not sure why I'm looking
through my jacket...

20:11.291 --> 20:13.125
Wow...

20:13.208 --> 20:16.375
Uh, what can I say about my dad?

20:16.458 --> 20:18.625
Well, he...
Oh!

20:18.709 --> 20:20.208
Thank you.

20:20.291 --> 20:23.333
- The apple doesn't fall far
from the tree!

20:23.417 --> 20:24.458
(chuckling)

20:25.542 --> 20:31.583
- Last time I saw him was
at my wedding five years ago.

20:31.667 --> 20:33.291
He flew in late and left early.

20:33.375 --> 20:38.375
Last time I talked to him was
last Christmas.

20:38.458 --> 20:40.834
Yeah, well...
I tried to talk to him.

20:40.917 --> 20:46.125
If you called after 4,
you really never knew
what you were gonna get.

20:46.208 --> 20:47.500
(scoffing)

20:49.709 --> 20:51.250
My dad was, uh...

20:51.750 --> 20:53.542
He was...

20:54.917 --> 20:57.500
He worked a lot.

20:58.583 --> 21:01.542
He... must've liked his job.

21:01.625 --> 21:06.375
He always paid his child
support on time. I think.

21:07.834 --> 21:10.166
He loved golf,

21:10.250 --> 21:10.834
probably more than...

21:10.917 --> 21:14.250
anything, really.

21:16.041 --> 21:18.834
I remember...

21:18.917 --> 21:23.000
he used to love
telling this one joke

21:23.083 --> 21:25.667
when I was a kid, over and over.

21:26.583 --> 21:31.333
It was about this golfer who got
home late

21:31.417 --> 21:36.375
and his wife was worried, upset.

21:36.458 --> 21:40.542
And the golfer explained
that on the...

21:40.625 --> 21:45.959
on the course, one of the
foursome had a heart attack
and died.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.291
Yeah... Uh...

21:50.375 --> 21:53.417
And the wife says, "Wow, that's
awful."

21:53.500 --> 21:58.375
And then the husband says,
"Yeah, it was terrible.

21:58.458 --> 22:01.375
Just... just terrible.

22:01.458 --> 22:06.625
The rest of the day was just:
Hit your ball, drag Walter.

22:08.667 --> 22:10.834
Hit your ball, drag Walter."

22:11.375 --> 22:14.542
(scattered laughs)

22:16.667 --> 22:18.792
Here's to you, Dad.

22:18.875 --> 22:22.375
I may not have known you well,
but... you brought me into this
world,

22:22.458 --> 22:24.667
served on some committees,

22:25.500 --> 22:28.792
and the ninth hole was
your favourite.

22:28.875 --> 22:30.667
One man's legacy. Cheers.

22:39.500 --> 22:41.250
- Thank you, Ken.

22:41.333 --> 22:45.583
Well, there's gonna be a brief
PowerPoint presentation,

22:45.667 --> 22:48.834
and then, in honour of Andy,
we can all go stand
in the sand trap.

22:49.834 --> 22:51.083
Rachel, would you grab
the lights?

22:51.166 --> 22:54.083

back for this.

23:21.458 --> 23:24.542
- Yeah, it's a gut-punch
to the nads alright.

23:25.542 --> 23:28.625
Say, how's your mom?
I thought she might come.

23:28.709 --> 23:31.458
- Guy disappears from my life
for 20 years and expects me

23:31.542 --> 23:34.959
just to... grant his final wish.

23:35.041 --> 23:39.458
- You wanna know why he wants
his ashes scattered on
the field?

23:39.542 --> 23:41.333
- It's not like he was a fan.

23:41.417 --> 23:43.875
Didn't go to the games.

23:43.959 --> 23:45.583
Didn't go anywhere.

23:46.583 --> 23:49.458
- He had season tickets
before you were born.

23:49.542 --> 23:51.041
- What?
- Yeah, and then,

23:51.125 --> 23:54.875
you came along and...
you know, he just...

23:54.959 --> 23:59.375
He let them go.
You know, said it was just too
expensive with a kid and all.

23:59.458 --> 24:00.709
And it broke his heart.

24:00.792 --> 24:03.792
But he never went
to another game. For you.

24:05.542 --> 24:06.583
- Is that true?

24:07.750 --> 24:09.917
(Vince): Hey!

24:10.000 --> 24:11.625
- Your dad came from a
generation that knew

24:11.709 --> 24:15.291
how to sacrifice without
putting it on Facebook.

24:15.375 --> 24:18.000
Hey, everybody,
I'm selfie-ing myself
washing oil off an owl.

24:18.083 --> 24:20.625
Give me a thumbs up and
a government grant.

24:20.709 --> 24:24.709
- I hate to rush you, Ken,
but I have some other legal
stuff that I should attend to.

24:24.792 --> 24:25.667
- Oh, yeah. Uh...

24:25.750 --> 24:28.709
Listen, I'm... I'm sorry, guys,
but--

24:28.792 --> 24:30.875
- Look, kid, I know how you
feel, but...

24:30.959 --> 24:32.875
trust me, it'll be worth
your while.

24:32.959 --> 24:35.542
- Jeff, the legal terms of
Andy's will quite clearly
state--

24:35.625 --> 24:38.542
- The legal terms can lick
my shitter.

24:38.625 --> 24:41.542
You want it done or not?
- Yes I want it done.

24:41.625 --> 24:43.875
And you know what,
with no funny stuff--
- Oh, here we go!

24:43.959 --> 24:46.041
Happens every time.
Five drinks in, never fails.

24:46.125 --> 24:48.000
- You know what the odds are
of the same person

24:48.083 --> 24:52.041
winning the three main prizes
at the Spring Fling Raffle lot?

24:52.125 --> 24:54.875
- You know, why don't you
just come out and say it?

24:54.959 --> 24:57.000
Say you think
I rigged the draw.

24:57.083 --> 24:59.709
- If the Boneco 7114
humidifier fits!

24:59.792 --> 25:00.875
(man screaming): Ball!

25:00.959 --> 25:02.792
(ball clanking)
- What the...?

25:02.875 --> 25:04.667
(both): Marty.

25:04.750 --> 25:08.917
- Hey, we're trying to play
through here! Am I right, guys?

25:09.000 --> 25:10.083
- No, that's not right.

25:10.166 --> 25:11.750
- No, we're standing
on a bridge.

25:11.834 --> 25:13.875
- This... this is not part of
the course.

25:14.750 --> 25:16.500
- Can we just rewind a little?
What were you saying there?

25:16.583 --> 25:21.875
- I'm just saying it could go a
long way towards setting up a
young family. You know?

25:21.959 --> 25:24.083
Well, unless you want your kid
to end up like Vinnie's.

25:24.166 --> 25:25.125
One felon and
one felon in training.

25:25.208 --> 25:27.291
What? Tell me I'm wrong.

25:27.375 --> 25:28.667
- Look, my oldest is...

25:32.083 --> 25:34.750
...is truly awful.

25:34.834 --> 25:36.500
Even the social worker says so.
- Yeah, lot of good she did.

25:36.583 --> 25:39.500
I'm from the government,
I'm here to help.

25:39.583 --> 25:43.000
- She says that
some teens just...
like to show it in public.

25:43.083 --> 25:47.500
There's nothing you can do other
than hope they grow out of it.

25:47.583 --> 25:51.875
Does your kid, uh... unzip his
fly and run through the
school yelling:

25:51.959 --> 25:54.625
"I'm the teacher,
I'm the teacher!
Learn this! Learn this!"

25:54.709 --> 25:57.959
Does your kid...?
Is that a normal kid thing...

25:58.041 --> 26:01.208
- Well, he's just a baby. So...

26:03.875 --> 26:07.125
- Okay, fine. Tell him.
(Jeff sighing)

26:07.208 --> 26:10.792
But the two-day timeline,
consider that carved in stone!

26:10.875 --> 26:12.291
- Ah...
- Oh, and I will also require

26:12.375 --> 26:17.792
what we call in the law business
evidence of disposal
of human remains.

26:19.208 --> 26:21.417
- What do they call it outside
the law business?

26:22.208 --> 26:24.542
- Lots of things.
There's lots of names for it.

26:24.625 --> 26:27.500
- Holy shit! $200,000?!
- I know!

26:27.583 --> 26:30.709
All I have to do is take
the ashes and scatter them
on a football field.

26:30.792 --> 26:33.125
- College fund, hello!

26:33.208 --> 26:35.709
- I know, that's what
I was thinking.

26:35.792 --> 26:38.542
Plus, we now can really talk
about the other thing that we
were, you know, were gonna do.

26:40.041 --> 26:43.500
- What other thing?
The gastropub thing?
That's still on the table?

26:43.583 --> 26:45.000
- Of course,
it's still on the table.

26:45.083 --> 26:47.583
Why would that not
be on the table?

26:47.667 --> 26:49.792
Just because there's
a kid at the table now?

26:49.875 --> 26:51.250
- Okay, easy, Cranky Pants.

26:51.333 --> 26:52.667
I had to put some stuff
on hold too, you know.

26:52.750 --> 26:55.917
(Ken sighing)
- I know. I'm sorry. It's...

26:56.000 --> 26:58.875
you know, still dealing with
a death in the family.

26:58.959 --> 27:01.667
- Hmm. Still milking that,
are we?

27:01.750 --> 27:07.333
- Okay. You realize that
there's a half-naked man
behind you holding our baby.

27:07.417 --> 27:09.750
- Yeah. I just needed a break.

27:09.834 --> 27:10.834
- Hmm.

27:10.917 --> 27:12.750
Did his shirt need a break too?

27:12.834 --> 27:16.542
- It's covered in your son's
puke. Not that I mind.

27:16.625 --> 27:20.709
- Hmm. You're lucky that
I am very secure.

27:20.792 --> 27:22.250
- Hmm?

27:22.333 --> 27:25.667
Nothing wrong with looking,
is there, Mr. Clear Browser
History?

27:25.750 --> 27:29.166
Hey, um...
wanna see somethin'?

27:30.667 --> 27:33.041
- Yeah, sure, I mean,
is it okay?

27:33.125 --> 27:35.834
Oh!

27:35.917 --> 27:39.166
- Does this look normal to you?
'Cause the Internet says it is,
but I do not think so.

27:39.250 --> 27:42.542
- No, it does not look normal!
What's wrong with you?

27:42.625 --> 27:44.750
(chuckling): Trust me,
it's even worse in person.

27:44.834 --> 27:45.709
- Alright. You know what?
I have to go.

27:45.792 --> 27:49.083
Love you.
- Yeah, you fucking better.

27:49.166 --> 27:52.125
'Cause he's great
with our kid
and I bet I can flip him.

27:52.208 --> 27:56.125
(mother chatting on the phone)

27:56.208 --> 27:59.667
You have an appointment
with the team's PR person
at 10 a.m. tomorrow.

27:59.750 --> 28:04.083
- Uh, okay.
What did you tell them?

28:04.166 --> 28:07.125
- That you wanted to discuss a
donation...

28:07.208 --> 28:08.291
...which was kind of true.

28:08.375 --> 28:11.000
- Thanks, Mom.

28:11.083 --> 28:15.750
Hey, did you know that Dad used
to have season tickets?

28:17.333 --> 28:18.291
- I did.

28:18.375 --> 28:22.041
- Oh.
- Andy...

28:22.125 --> 28:25.875
- Did I know that?
- Ashes to ashes...

28:25.959 --> 28:28.083
Whoa!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

28:28.166 --> 28:29.625
- Oopsie, all good. Easy fix.

28:29.709 --> 28:33.041
- Easy fix!? There's like,
what's equivalent to a foot
on the floor now.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.625
- It comes at you faster than
you think, you know.

28:37.709 --> 28:40.959
I hope I'm not all alone
at the end.

28:41.041 --> 28:43.125
- You're not gonna be alone,
Mom.

28:43.208 --> 28:47.750
- My son moved to another city,
my husband is in a plastic bag.

28:47.834 --> 28:49.083
- Ex-husband! Who you hated.

28:49.166 --> 28:54.125
- Who stole the best years of
my life and wore me out,

28:54.208 --> 28:55.583
so nobody else
would ever want me.

28:55.667 --> 29:01.041
"Oh, I got time." You get
pregnant at 19, you do what
you have to...

29:01.125 --> 29:03.667
Ah-ha!

29:04.583 --> 29:07.333
These never tear.
- Ah...

29:07.417 --> 29:11.208
Okay, let's move Dad over here.

29:14.500 --> 29:16.834
Let's just...
- There's a lot of him.

29:16.917 --> 29:20.125
- Mm-hmm.
- I feel like a drug dealer.

29:22.417 --> 29:24.959
- So here's something I was
always curious about.

29:26.750 --> 29:29.959
When did you know that you and
Dad weren't gonna work out?

29:30.041 --> 29:32.000
- Why do you ask?

29:32.083 --> 29:34.250
- Uh... just wondering.

29:36.041 --> 29:39.750
- I'd have to say the second day
of our honeymoon.

29:41.917 --> 29:46.083
Do you remember that
popsicle-stick fort we made
when you were in grade school?

29:47.834 --> 29:48.917
It's fun doing activities.

29:50.792 --> 29:52.208
Go on.

29:52.291 --> 29:55.000
(phone alarm ringing)

30:11.458 --> 30:14.750
- You go in the backseat
in there, Dad.

30:16.834 --> 30:18.083
(sighing)

30:39.458 --> 30:41.166
(phone ringing)

30:54.834 --> 30:56.333
Hello.

30:56.417 --> 31:01.250
- Hey, it's Jeff. What number
came up when you got this?

31:01.333 --> 31:04.250
- What... what... my dad's!
What number you think came up?

31:04.333 --> 31:07.000
- Yeah, okay, yeah. Well,
he said I could
have his phone.

31:07.083 --> 31:11.709
So I got some roll-over minutes
to use up before I switch
the number. Where are you?

31:11.792 --> 31:14.333
- I'm at the Stadium.
- Wow!

31:14.417 --> 31:17.291
Just remember, we need
a picture, evidence
or some shit.

31:17.375 --> 31:18.959
And there's a box of stuff
for you at your dad's house.

31:19.041 --> 31:23.250
- Yeah, I'll swing by after.
Probably...

31:24.458 --> 31:26.291
I just realize I don't even know
where he lived.

31:26.375 --> 31:28.917
- I'll send you the address.
I can meet you there.

31:29.000 --> 31:34.125
If you get there first,
he keeps the key under
a rusty can by the back door.

31:34.208 --> 31:35.250
- Rusty can. Alright.

31:35.333 --> 31:37.208
- Lady, I know there's no phone
at the tables--

31:43.875 --> 31:46.542
(soft music)

32:01.959 --> 32:03.166
- Hello!

32:05.083 --> 32:07.083
Hi, are you Ken?

32:07.166 --> 32:10.166
- Ah, yes.
- I'm Katherine. Hi.

32:10.250 --> 32:13.000
Your assistant said on the phone
your father recently passed.

32:13.083 --> 32:14.667
I'm so sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

32:14.750 --> 32:19.208
- Have you considered a
contribution in your father's
name to our Foundation?

32:19.291 --> 32:23.458
You know, we can actually put
his name on a brick

32:23.542 --> 32:24.750
on our Wall of Super Fans.

32:24.834 --> 32:29.166
- Well, that's kind of why I'm
here. Now this may sound odd,

32:29.250 --> 32:34.500
but my dad really wanted his
ashes scattered on the field.

32:34.583 --> 32:38.041
- Hmm...
- Your field.

32:38.125 --> 32:39.041
- Hmm...

32:42.458 --> 32:44.125
- That one.

32:46.208 --> 32:48.917
- I totally understand and
we can't do that.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.125
Just health issues for
the players, coaches, staff...

32:53.208 --> 32:57.208
- And I thought of that,
so what if, in addition
to a sizeable donation,

32:57.291 --> 33:01.083
I had a professional cleaning
service come in with a...

33:01.166 --> 33:04.542
you know, like a Shop-Vac?
Or something better.

33:04.625 --> 33:07.500
So that I could just, you know,
get a picture with the ashes

33:07.583 --> 33:09.000
being scattered or placed.
- Right.

33:09.083 --> 33:12.375
- And they can vacuum up
everything and...

33:12.458 --> 33:14.417
like we were never here.
- Right, right.

33:14.500 --> 33:18.125
Yeah, no, we can't do that.
It's just... it's club policy.

33:19.000 --> 33:23.458
- Really? Do you really get
that request enough that
there's a rule?

33:23.542 --> 33:28.500
- Well, I mean, anything that's
not authorized is considered
unauthorized, so...

33:28.583 --> 33:30.083
- Mm-hmm! Right.

33:30.166 --> 33:33.250
So what if this one time...
you just...

33:33.333 --> 33:36.041
authorize something that
was unauthorized?

33:36.125 --> 33:39.000
- I'm not authorized, yeah.

33:39.083 --> 33:43.959
- Could I speak to someone
who is?

33:44.041 --> 33:45.250
- You know, why don't you send
us an email?

33:48.375 --> 33:51.250
Now, is there anything else
I can help you with?

33:51.709 --> 33:55.375
- Well... no.

33:55.458 --> 33:57.875
- All the best. Yeah, again,

33:57.959 --> 34:00.208
sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

34:07.709 --> 34:10.333
(soft music)

34:10.417 --> 34:13.125
(phone ringing)

34:13.208 --> 34:18.000
Yeah?
- Hey, buddy, it's your boss.

34:18.083 --> 34:20.250
Just wanted to see
how the funeral went.

34:20.333 --> 34:24.458
- It went... about as well as
could be expected.

34:24.542 --> 34:25.875
- Oh, great, awesome.

34:25.958 --> 34:30.125
So, hey, any progress
on the old PP,
Senor El Power Pointo?

34:30.208 --> 34:34.625
I hate to ask, but it's...
crazy around here.

34:34.708 --> 34:35.792
We're down a guy,
so it's nuts.

34:35.875 --> 34:38.625
- Uh... I'm working on it.

34:38.708 --> 34:41.458
- Listen, you do what you need
for you first, okay?

34:41.542 --> 34:44.458
Just let me know later today.

34:44.542 --> 34:47.208
- Yeah. Alright.

34:56.375 --> 34:59.375
(soft music)

35:15.792 --> 35:20.625
(metal clanging)

35:28.709 --> 35:31.750
(grunting)

35:50.000 --> 35:52.333
- Hey.
- Oh, shit!

35:52.417 --> 35:53.542
Hey, man.

35:53.625 --> 35:56.125
- What the hell you think
you're doing?

35:56.208 --> 36:00.000
- Uh, yeah. Funny story.
Actually, I was just...

36:00.083 --> 36:03.458
meeting with your PR department.

36:03.542 --> 36:07.291
- Get off the gate, nutjob.
- Yeah, I got you.

36:07.375 --> 36:10.500
Um... If you could just hand me
my... my bag real quick.

36:12.542 --> 36:13.458
- What's in it?

36:15.375 --> 36:17.166
You got a bomb in here?

36:17.250 --> 36:22.250
Is this some alt-right
false flag operation?

36:22.333 --> 36:25.333
- What, no? No flags...

36:25.417 --> 36:28.208
No, no, no, don't open that,
please.

36:28.291 --> 36:29.417
- I think I better get the cops.

36:31.750 --> 36:33.291
- Wait, wait, wait, no!
It's my dad.

36:35.125 --> 36:36.542
It's my dead dad.
It's his ashes.

36:36.625 --> 36:37.834
- Don't play me, kid.
- I'm not playing you.

36:37.917 --> 36:41.458
- How do I know you're just not
some jock-sniffing pervert?

36:43.166 --> 36:45.500
- Well, I mean...

36:45.583 --> 36:48.583
It's kinda hard
to prove a negative.

36:48.667 --> 36:52.250
Is that a big problem around
here? Jock sniffers?

36:53.083 --> 36:54.709
- I've seen some things.

36:55.834 --> 37:00.333
- Huh.
- Would you mind getting off
my gate, please?

37:00.417 --> 37:02.500
- Yeah. Yes, absolutely.

37:05.625 --> 37:07.542
Alright, here I go.

37:07.625 --> 37:10.625
Okay.

37:10.709 --> 37:13.583
Just hand me my bag, please.
- Sure.

37:14.709 --> 37:16.583
What's it worth to you?

37:17.792 --> 37:21.000
- How's 20 bucks?

37:21.083 --> 37:23.500
- Deal.
- Alright.

37:26.750 --> 37:29.333
Or... uh...

37:29.417 --> 37:31.166
how about...

37:31.250 --> 37:33.333
I give you everything in my
wallet

37:33.417 --> 37:38.375
if you just take those ashes
and sprinkle them at midfield?

37:39.917 --> 37:41.792
- How much is everything?

37:44.375 --> 37:45.500
- I got...

37:45.583 --> 37:49.333
20... 40... 50...

37:50.583 --> 37:53.458
I can head to an ATM.
- No!

37:54.834 --> 37:57.417
Better off no paper trail.

37:57.500 --> 37:59.333
These guys'll be done in a
couple hours.

37:59.417 --> 38:03.208
I'm already off,
but I'll come back.

38:03.291 --> 38:04.500
- Perfect.

38:04.583 --> 38:06.625
I'll just wait for you here.
- Can't wait.

38:06.709 --> 38:09.333
Security does sweeps,
you'll get us caught.

38:09.417 --> 38:12.667
- Okay, here, here.
Take my card, okay?

38:12.750 --> 38:16.792
Kenneth Wall, that's me.
Here's my phone number, okay?

38:16.875 --> 38:18.917
Take that, if you could text me

38:19.000 --> 38:22.792
a picture of you dumping
the ashes at midfield.

38:22.875 --> 38:24.709
- Sure, yeah.
- Okay?

38:24.792 --> 38:26.208
You got a phone?
- Yeah.

38:26.291 --> 38:27.625
- You know how to text?

38:29.709 --> 38:33.291
Alright, cool. Thanks, man.
- You...

38:34.291 --> 38:36.500
If you want... I should say
something when I dump him?

38:36.583 --> 38:40.542
- Uh... if the mood strikes you.
- I know a poem.

38:40.625 --> 38:44.000
- Cool. That'd be great.

38:44.083 --> 38:46.333
- "Do not stand on my grave
and weep.

38:46.417 --> 38:50.208
I am not there,
I do not sleep.

38:50.291 --> 38:52.875
I'm a thousand winds that blow.

38:52.959 --> 38:57.208
I'm the diamond glints on snow.

38:57.291 --> 39:00.000
I am the sun
on ripened grain.

39:00.083 --> 39:03.333
I am the gentle autumn rain."

39:03.417 --> 39:06.917
- It's beautiful. Thank you.
Alright.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.834
- "When you awaken..."
- Not done yet, okay.

39:09.917 --> 39:12.083
- "...in the morning hush.

39:12.166 --> 39:15.959
I am the swift uplifting rush

39:16.041 --> 39:18.417
of quiet birds in circled
flight.

39:18.500 --> 39:21.667
I am the soft stars
that shine at night.

39:21.750 --> 39:24.625
Do not stand at my grave
and cry.

39:24.709 --> 39:29.000
I am not there; I did not die."

39:39.875 --> 39:41.583
(soft music)

40:17.792 --> 40:19.875
(car beeping)

40:55.625 --> 40:58.083
(creaking)
Hmm...

40:59.583 --> 41:01.625
(whirring)

41:04.583 --> 41:05.959
(phone ringing)

41:06.041 --> 41:08.583
- Hey, buddy!

41:08.667 --> 41:10.041
How's it going?

41:10.125 --> 41:12.959
(whispering):
I'm in my dad's house.

41:13.041 --> 41:15.834
- Why are you whispering?

41:15.917 --> 41:17.542
- I don't know.

41:18.417 --> 41:19.834
Check this out.

41:21.041 --> 41:24.709
- What is that?
- A drill press, I think.

41:24.792 --> 41:26.208
- He wasn't a serial killer,
was he?

41:26.291 --> 41:30.208
- Um, I'm gonna go with...

41:30.291 --> 41:32.458
...maybe.
- That's not funny,

41:32.542 --> 41:33.583
that shit's fucking genetic.

41:35.500 --> 41:37.583
- Oh, found the remote.

41:41.625 --> 41:43.875
- Did someone already clear out
his stuff?

41:43.959 --> 41:46.000
- No, I think this is just

41:46.083 --> 41:47.667
how he lived.

41:49.208 --> 41:52.083
- Wow... it's really...

41:52.166 --> 41:53.917
lonely.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.917
- Creepy.

41:59.750 --> 42:02.000
Holy shit.

42:03.875 --> 42:06.041
What the...
- Wow...

42:06.125 --> 42:09.166
Okay, I guess he had a thing
for planes.

42:09.250 --> 42:11.500
- Apparently.

42:12.709 --> 42:14.500
- And Halloween-themed
carpeting.

42:14.583 --> 42:18.083
What if he had this like,
weird secret fetish that...

42:18.166 --> 42:21.417
Holy shit, Ken, behind you!
- What the fuck?!

42:21.500 --> 42:23.750
- Easy, A-Rod!
The door was open.

42:23.834 --> 42:25.625
- You scared the shit out of me.
Sorry.

42:27.583 --> 42:29.125
Oh, that's my wife, Laurie.

42:29.208 --> 42:33.709
Laurie, this is Jeff, he's
the executor of my dad's will.

42:33.792 --> 42:36.709
- Nice to meet you, pretty lady.
- Hi! Nice to meet you.

42:36.792 --> 42:39.000
Sorry to scream,

42:39.083 --> 42:41.625
I just didn't exp--
(baby crying)

42:41.709 --> 42:43.583
Fuck, Ken. Not again.

42:43.667 --> 42:45.500
- What did I do?

42:45.583 --> 42:48.709
- They really stay filled out
after they pop one, don't they?

42:50.291 --> 42:51.792
I'm talking about her titties.
- Yeah, I got it.

42:55.875 --> 42:58.000
- Here's that box I was telling
you about.

42:58.375 --> 43:00.709
- Yeah.

43:02.250 --> 43:04.125
Native-American man
in a loin cloth.

43:04.208 --> 43:05.792
That's not mine.

43:07.166 --> 43:08.542
Ah...

43:08.625 --> 43:12.250
Sports Illustrated
calendar from 2007.

43:16.667 --> 43:19.792
What's this?
- Your dad was quite an athlete.

43:19.875 --> 43:24.083
- Yeah, this is mine.
From like... 25 years ago.

43:25.125 --> 43:27.834
Peewee division C tournament
champion.

43:27.917 --> 43:30.625
Smallest guy on the team.
I, uh... I scored the winning
touchdown.

43:30.709 --> 43:33.917
Interception, free safety,
of course.

43:34.000 --> 43:37.959
Forty-yard run, got tackled at
the one...

43:38.041 --> 43:40.375
fumbled, came up
with the ball... ah!

43:40.458 --> 43:44.250
Rob Seydoff, the biggest guy
on the team fell on my arm,
broke it in three places.

43:44.333 --> 43:46.125
Mom never let me play again.
- Wow.

43:46.208 --> 43:49.125
And he kept that souvenir
all these years.

43:49.208 --> 43:53.667
He probably had some fond
memories of you... out there,
playing your heart out.

43:53.750 --> 43:58.709
- Yeah, no, he... he missed it.
Last-minute meeting.

43:59.500 --> 44:01.083
- You know, a man's gotta work.

44:01.166 --> 44:02.250
- Last-minute meeting means
he'd get drunk at lunch.

44:02.333 --> 44:04.625
(clattering)

44:05.291 --> 44:07.959
- Anything else you wanna take?
- No, I'm good.

44:13.792 --> 44:16.750
So what's the deal with all
the airplane stuff?

44:16.834 --> 44:19.709
- You didn't know? Your dad
always wanted to be a pilot.

44:19.792 --> 44:21.041
- Really?
- Yeah.

44:21.125 --> 44:22.917
He even took flying lessons
when he was y...

44:23.000 --> 44:25.083
Oh, my God!

44:26.291 --> 44:28.291
Yeah, I guess this was
the next best thing.

44:31.083 --> 44:32.834
You know, I should probably...

44:32.917 --> 44:35.917
I should probably keep these.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.917
You know, I just wouldn't want
the guys at Goodwill getting

44:39.000 --> 44:40.917
the wrong idea about
your old man.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.083
- Knock yourself out.

44:44.166 --> 44:45.542
- You hungry?

44:45.625 --> 44:48.583
(soft lounge music)

44:48.667 --> 44:50.750
- It'll be fine.
- Oh, I don't know.

44:50.834 --> 44:53.667
I'm the executor, I'm supposed
to witness any ash-related
activity.

44:53.750 --> 44:55.333
I'll be signing an affidavit.

44:55.417 --> 44:57.959
- Well, it's the only way
it was gonna happen.

44:58.041 --> 44:59.166
- Well, I guess.

44:59.250 --> 45:01.583
- Good food here?
- No, no, terrible.

45:01.667 --> 45:03.291
Your dad's favourite spot.

45:03.375 --> 45:04.417
Ah, looks like someone got their
suspension lifted.

45:04.500 --> 45:06.667
It's a grabby Irish fuck.

45:06.750 --> 45:09.625
Don't get the wrong idea
about your dad.

45:09.709 --> 45:12.959
He wasn't some pervert.
Never liked to sit right up
in sniffer's row.

45:13.041 --> 45:16.333
He said:
"Too close ruins the mystery."

45:16.417 --> 45:19.000
- Try watching a kid come out of
there.

45:19.083 --> 45:20.917
- What kind of sick bastard
are you?

45:21.917 --> 45:23.291
- So, uh...

45:23.917 --> 45:26.709
was my dad seeing anyone?

45:27.333 --> 45:29.959
- Yeah, women get to a certain
age, they don't wanna bone
anymore.

45:30.041 --> 45:33.917
And your dad was very private
about that kind of thing.

45:34.000 --> 45:34.875
And I prefer women of a certain
vintage,

45:34.959 --> 45:38.125
but given the choice
between nothing and

45:38.208 --> 45:39.959
a young pro with a
kung fu grip...

45:40.041 --> 45:41.417
this is not ideal.

45:41.500 --> 45:43.083
- So, the AA meeting broke
early.

45:43.166 --> 45:44.917
You got 20 minutes left
to the buffet. Get you a drink?

45:45.000 --> 45:47.208
- Oh, thanks, it's a little
early for me.

45:47.291 --> 45:48.834
(both): There's a two-drink
minimum, honey.

45:48.917 --> 45:50.250
- Well, I guess, uh...

45:50.333 --> 45:51.875
- My God!

45:51.959 --> 45:55.166
You look exactly
like this guy I know.

45:55.250 --> 45:58.834
- Yeah, maybe because
it's Andy's kid.

45:58.917 --> 46:00.000
- No, shit.

46:01.083 --> 46:03.125
No fucking shit!

46:03.208 --> 46:05.750
Cindy! Get your tits over here!

46:05.834 --> 46:09.291
- Hey, Velvet, could you, uh...
get me a Bloody Mary
and her sister?

46:09.375 --> 46:10.208
- Lunch of champions.

46:10.291 --> 46:12.667
And you?
- Does it have to be alcoholic?

46:13.417 --> 46:16.208
- What are you? A comedian?
- I'll just have a Coke.

46:16.291 --> 46:17.375
- Two Jack and Cokes.

46:18.583 --> 46:20.792
- Some horny boys over here
looking for a little lap love?

46:20.875 --> 46:22.834
- Who does he look like?

46:23.917 --> 46:25.709
(whispering): Who does
he think he looks like?

46:28.375 --> 46:29.417
- Hello.

46:30.750 --> 46:32.250
- It's like a little Andy.

46:32.333 --> 46:35.208
I mean, not what Andy calls
his little Andy, but...

46:35.291 --> 46:37.750
Wow!

46:37.834 --> 46:40.041
- That's his kid.

46:40.125 --> 46:41.333
- Aw...

46:42.291 --> 46:44.250
Hey, I can do
a father-son discount.

46:44.333 --> 46:45.875
Where is the old rascal?

46:45.959 --> 46:48.458
- He's uh... he's gone, honey.

46:50.250 --> 46:51.083
He's dead.

46:51.458 --> 46:53.834
- What?

46:54.500 --> 46:57.208
- Well, that's poopy.

46:57.291 --> 46:58.917
(man): Miss, the check, please!

47:01.333 --> 47:03.417
- I knew he was sick.

47:03.500 --> 47:05.875
I'm so sorry--
- For my loss, yes.

47:05.959 --> 47:07.125
Thank you very much.

47:08.166 --> 47:09.083
- How about a dance
on the house?

47:09.166 --> 47:12.542
I mean, you guys can still tip
if you want.

47:12.625 --> 47:14.375
- I'm okay.
- That'd be swell.

47:14.458 --> 47:17.959
- Oh, yay! I've been so horny
all morning.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.792
- Stroke of luck for me then.

47:22.417 --> 47:23.959
(Jeff moaning)
- Your dad was so great.

47:24.041 --> 47:25.750
- Thank you, very sweet of you.

47:25.834 --> 47:27.417
- She's not just saying that.

47:27.500 --> 47:29.375
When Cindy needed braces, her...

47:29.458 --> 47:31.083
Maggie's son's lawyer -

47:31.166 --> 47:32.834
Friday Maggie,
not pierced Maggie -

47:32.917 --> 47:34.291
when he turned out to be a
total piece of shit,

47:34.375 --> 47:36.875
Andy was the first one
with his wallet out.

47:36.959 --> 47:40.166
- Did you know he invented
cutting the pockets out of the
inside of your sweat pants?

47:40.250 --> 47:42.166
- I did not. But no doubt that
he said that.

47:42.250 --> 47:46.125
- Yeah. I mean, even toward
the end, when he couldn't...

47:47.250 --> 47:49.959
express his affection
the way most guys do,

47:50.041 --> 47:52.458
he would still come in here
just to talk.

47:52.542 --> 47:54.000
- Wait a minute.

47:54.083 --> 47:57.458
You knew he was sick
and you didn't tell me?!

47:58.625 --> 48:01.417
- Client-dancer confidentiality,
you taught me that.

48:01.500 --> 48:04.208
- Don't worry about it.
I'm his kid and he didn't
even tell me.

48:04.291 --> 48:07.250
It's not like he's... a decent
human being in any way.

48:07.333 --> 48:08.500
- Hey!

48:08.583 --> 48:11.208
Shut your mouth.

48:11.291 --> 48:14.083
- It's okay. It's okay...

48:16.834 --> 48:18.208
- Hey, I'm sorry.

48:18.291 --> 48:21.959
I mean, he wasn't the greatest
guy all the time, but...

48:22.041 --> 48:24.125
you know,
we all have our faults.

48:25.083 --> 48:26.250
- Did you guys...?

48:26.792 --> 48:29.041
- A long time ago.

48:29.875 --> 48:31.750
- Guesstimate for me.

48:31.834 --> 48:34.125
- 20 years...

48:34.208 --> 48:36.458
The 90's are a little fuzzy
for me.

48:36.542 --> 48:39.166
- Before or after my parents
split up?

48:40.208 --> 48:41.542
- Hey, I'm sorry, kid.

48:41.625 --> 48:44.083
I didn't pull the ripcord
on your parents' marriage.

48:44.959 --> 48:47.333
I was just one of the many spots
he landed.

48:47.417 --> 48:51.166
(sighing)
Jesus! He was a charmer.

48:52.041 --> 48:55.125
You know, on our first date,
he bought this little stuffed
bear.

48:55.959 --> 48:59.041
God, we got shit-faced and
ended up in a tattoo parlour!

48:59.125 --> 49:00.500
(Ken): Oh, no, no, that's okay.
- That's it.

49:00.583 --> 49:02.166
- Yep, there it is.

49:03.083 --> 49:07.083
- I was a tight piece of ass
back then.

49:07.166 --> 49:08.875
- Oh, yeah, she was.

49:08.959 --> 49:10.750
I saw a VHS evidence tape
of her once.
(sniffing)

49:10.834 --> 49:13.000
- Your dad...

49:13.083 --> 49:16.125
He could treat a lady
like a f-ing lady!
(crying)

49:20.500 --> 49:22.375
- Aw...

49:22.834 --> 49:24.291
Don't be blue.

49:26.041 --> 49:28.542
- I'm okay.
- He's fine, he's fine.

49:28.625 --> 49:31.291
- No, look at him.
He's all frowny.

49:32.333 --> 49:35.458
- Yeah, that's just the way
my face kind of sits.

49:37.417 --> 49:39.458
- Let's see what you inherited
from your old man.

49:39.542 --> 49:40.834
- Huh?

49:40.917 --> 49:42.917
It's okay, thank you.
I'm sorry.

49:44.333 --> 49:45.583
- I got it, I got it.

49:52.333 --> 49:54.208
Hey, you alright?

49:54.291 --> 49:55.542
You didn't go hair-trigger,
did you?

49:56.458 --> 49:58.625
- This is all some big fucking
joke to you, huh?

49:58.709 --> 50:01.041
Hey, I know what'd be funny,

50:01.125 --> 50:05.417
is if the stripper that used to
jerk off my buddy Andy,
jerked off his son too!

50:05.500 --> 50:06.875
Oh, you know
what'd be even better?

50:06.959 --> 50:10.959
Is if that same stripper knew
that he was dying
before even I did.

50:11.041 --> 50:13.208
- Technically, you never even
knew he was dying, so--

50:13.291 --> 50:13.750
- No, technically,
he's an asshole.

50:13.834 --> 50:16.208
- A complex asshole.

50:16.291 --> 50:18.291
- A complex asshole
who left my mom for a stripper.

50:18.375 --> 50:20.792
- And who cared about
the juvenile justice system.

50:20.875 --> 50:22.583
- For a stripper's kid.

50:22.667 --> 50:26.291
- You're obsessed with
the erotic arts, aren't you?
(phone ringing)

50:30.208 --> 50:31.417
- Hello?

50:31.500 --> 50:33.959
- Son of a bitch!
If you came in town

50:34.041 --> 50:35.542
and didn't tell me,
I'll fucking kill you.

50:35.625 --> 50:36.125
- Cam!

50:36.208 --> 50:40.333
What's up, man? Uh...

50:40.417 --> 50:43.834
Sorry I didn't call you.
I'm here for my dad's funeral.

50:43.917 --> 50:45.625
- Oh... sorry for your loss.

50:45.709 --> 50:48.208
Is that what people say?

50:48.291 --> 50:49.208
- That's about all they say.

50:49.291 --> 50:52.458
How did you...
how did you know I was here?

50:52.542 --> 50:54.500
- Your wife and my wife started
Facebooking after the wedding.

50:54.583 --> 50:58.000
And she just posted
some diaper pick,
and blah, blah, blah...

50:58.083 --> 50:59.625
Who gives a shit? Come over
tonight, meet the child.

50:59.709 --> 51:03.041
See how your life
will be boned
for the next 18 years.

51:03.125 --> 51:06.875
- Well, as tempting as that
sounds, I think I'm gonna have
to catch the red-eye back, so...

51:06.959 --> 51:09.125
- Fuck you, motherfucker.

51:09.208 --> 51:11.041
Come over, I'm texting you
the address, 7 o'clock.

51:11.125 --> 51:13.834
Bring anything and die.
- Alright.

51:13.917 --> 51:15.375
- Also, I'm sorry I said "die".

51:15.458 --> 51:17.417
Later, asshole.

51:19.792 --> 51:22.291
- An old friend.

51:23.041 --> 51:24.250
So...

51:24.333 --> 51:26.291
I guess that's it.

51:27.333 --> 51:29.542
I'll just send you the picture
when I get it.

51:31.083 --> 51:32.333
- I guess so.

51:35.041 --> 51:35.792
- Just contact me...

51:35.875 --> 51:39.542
when the estate settles.

51:43.291 --> 51:45.125
Nice meeting you.

51:45.208 --> 51:46.709
- You too.

51:49.667 --> 51:50.375
- You're going back in?

51:52.208 --> 51:55.542
- We all grieve in our own way,
Ken.

51:57.542 --> 51:59.375
(club music)
We all grieve in our own way.

52:07.291 --> 52:08.667
(sighing)

52:08.750 --> 52:10.041
- 'Cause you'll be the person
that'll be handling this.

52:10.125 --> 52:12.250
I mean, I can't, you know,
leave it up to my--
(door closing)

52:12.333 --> 52:14.542
And there he is!

52:14.625 --> 52:15.250
Lori, I'll be right back.

52:17.291 --> 52:18.417
It rang and I picked up.

52:20.417 --> 52:22.083
- Hello.

52:22.166 --> 52:24.291
- How did it go?
- Uh...

52:24.375 --> 52:28.166
Good, good. I got a guy
dumping him as we speak.

52:28.250 --> 52:31.417
(chuckling)
- You got a guy, huh?

52:31.500 --> 52:34.250
- Yeah, you know. I got... I
found an ash-dumping guy.

52:34.333 --> 52:35.458
- Impressive.

52:35.542 --> 52:39.125
Daddy's coming home! Yay!

52:39.208 --> 52:42.625
(baby cooing)
- Oh, hi! There he is.

52:42.709 --> 52:45.583
(Lori singing
The Circle of Life)

52:45.667 --> 52:47.333
(Ken): Hi! There's my... child.

52:47.417 --> 52:50.709
So, what were you and my mom
talking about?

52:50.792 --> 52:55.166
- Your mom went to some holistic
funeral home

52:55.250 --> 52:57.583
and came back
with a bunch of pamphlets.

52:57.667 --> 52:59.250
I think she's really bored.

52:59.333 --> 53:01.166
- Well...
- So, Lori,

53:01.250 --> 53:03.083
the sandalwood one

53:03.166 --> 53:06.250
is 80% post-consumer fibre.

53:06.333 --> 53:08.583
- Mom, what are you doing?
You're in perfect health.

53:08.667 --> 53:11.083
- I know.
But there's nothing wrong
with preparing

53:11.166 --> 53:14.375
for the inevitable transition
into the next realm
of existence.

53:14.458 --> 53:17.792
So the super-eco option...
- I think she's talking
about Florida.

53:17.875 --> 53:21.417
- ...which seems better than
the mushroom death suit.

53:21.500 --> 53:24.375
Let me show. I'll be right back.
- Nobody likes the mushroom
death suit.

53:24.458 --> 53:26.417
(baby cooing)
- 20 minutes of that.

53:26.500 --> 53:29.041
Is she gonna be okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

53:29.125 --> 53:30.667
She'll be fine.

53:30.750 --> 53:33.667
I'll just remove all the sharp
objects before I come home.

53:33.750 --> 53:36.458
- What time
does your flight land?
- Uh...

53:36.542 --> 53:40.208
Actually, I'm gonna hop
on the first flight tomorrow
morning.

53:40.291 --> 53:43.667
- Tomorrow?
What happened to tonight?

53:43.750 --> 53:44.875
- Well, Cam called.

53:44.959 --> 53:47.083
So I thought I'd, you know,
since I'm here already,

53:47.166 --> 53:48.625
I'd swing by,

53:48.709 --> 53:50.583
maybe get some new dad tips.

53:50.667 --> 53:55.458
- Here's a dad tip, come hang
out with your actual family.

53:55.542 --> 53:59.417
- Okay. Just, can we not...
it's just been a long,

53:59.500 --> 54:00.792
weird, stressful day.

54:00.875 --> 54:03.583
- Oh, it's been stressful
for you?

54:03.667 --> 54:06.291
I'm so sorry to hear that.
No stress over here by the way.

54:06.375 --> 54:08.750
This kid kind of raises himself.

54:08.834 --> 54:10.500
I just leave out some Kibble

54:10.583 --> 54:12.333
and figured I'd check back in
before college.

54:12.417 --> 54:15.125
- So now, we're using the kid
as a weapon?

54:15.208 --> 54:18.333
- No, not until his skull
firms up.

54:18.834 --> 54:21.250
I know you're dealing
with a lot of stuff, Ken,

54:21.333 --> 54:22.750
but I could really use a hand,

54:22.834 --> 54:24.792
and you're off tearing it up
with your homies.

54:24.875 --> 54:27.250
- I'm not tearing it up
with anybody!

54:27.333 --> 54:29.458
I have no homies to tear it up
with. I don't know
what you're taking about.

54:29.542 --> 54:30.458
Okay? You said it was fine.
So I came.

54:30.542 --> 54:33.417
(baby crying)
- It's okay. It's alright.

54:33.500 --> 54:35.333
- It's just an extra 12 hours.
You'll be fine. Call Trent

54:35.417 --> 54:37.375
and have him come over
and take his shirt off.

54:37.458 --> 54:40.709
- Yeah. You caught us.
That's why I'm so exhausted.

54:40.792 --> 54:42.000
Just been gay-fucking

54:42.083 --> 54:43.875
his gay brains out all over
our gay fucking apartment.

54:43.959 --> 54:46.542
It's just a peg-a-palooza
out here.
- Okay, okay, alright.

54:46.625 --> 54:49.333
- Thank God I rush-ordered
that big, fat strap-on!

54:49.417 --> 54:51.875
- Please,
would you lower your voice!

54:51.959 --> 54:53.542
(baby cooing)
(sighing)

54:53.625 --> 54:56.542
- Well, you know, at least
someone's getting some action.

54:56.625 --> 54:58.667
- It took 16 hours to push

54:58.750 --> 55:01.333
our little bowling ball of love
out of my fucking vagina.

55:01.417 --> 55:04.542
And you wonder
why I'm not in the mood?

55:04.625 --> 55:06.709
- Okay. I regretted that

55:06.792 --> 55:09.500
the moment that I said it,
but, you know,
it has been six months.

55:09.583 --> 55:11.250
- You didn't want to fuck
a pregnant lady!

55:11.333 --> 55:13.667
(baby crying)
- Oh, see? Now, he's crying.

55:13.750 --> 55:15.959
It's okay.
- Shh, shh... It's okay.

55:16.041 --> 55:19.250
- It's okay. Sorry.

55:19.333 --> 55:21.583
Do you have to feed him?

55:21.667 --> 55:23.417
- Yeah. But you know what?

55:23.500 --> 55:26.750
Good news, left tit
stopped bleeding today. So...

55:26.834 --> 55:28.208
- Lori, hold...

55:28.542 --> 55:31.125
- So, this one seems
really interesting.

55:31.208 --> 55:32.500
This is the funeral pyre.

55:32.583 --> 55:35.291
The only problem is
it is weather dependent.

55:35.375 --> 55:38.834
- She's gone, mom.
She's not there anymore.

55:41.333 --> 55:43.291
- Sorry for the mess.

55:43.375 --> 55:46.834
- No. It's like
seeing into my future.

55:46.917 --> 55:50.583
- Yeah, well, hopefully, yours
isn't a bile-spewing monster
like ours is.

55:50.667 --> 55:51.917
- Yeah.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.250
- Hey, to your dad.
- Yeah.

55:54.333 --> 55:55.959
My dad...

55:56.458 --> 55:58.458
You know, he...

55:58.542 --> 56:01.250
He used to take flying lessons.

56:01.333 --> 56:03.000
- How the fuck
would I know that?

56:03.083 --> 56:07.709
- I don't know.
I just found out that... uh...

56:07.792 --> 56:11.166
he wanted to be a pilot
when he was younger.

56:11.250 --> 56:13.417
- Huh... Why'd he stop?

56:13.917 --> 56:16.417
- Not a hot clue.

56:16.917 --> 56:20.500
- You know,
when my grandfather died,
my grandma found all these like,

56:20.583 --> 56:21.250
men's "bodybuilding" magazines.

56:21.333 --> 56:23.709
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

56:23.792 --> 56:26.458
I'm only here because of
intolerance in the '50s.

56:26.542 --> 56:29.041
- Interesting.
- You never really know anyone.

56:29.125 --> 56:31.500
(birds chirping)

56:31.583 --> 56:33.583
Did you ever open that bar?

56:33.667 --> 56:33.959
- Gastropub.

56:34.041 --> 56:35.458
Brew pub.

56:35.542 --> 56:39.959
I'm still kind of trying
to decide between...

56:40.792 --> 56:42.041
Although they're both so trendy
now. I probably missed the bus.

56:42.125 --> 56:44.208
- Parenthood...

56:44.291 --> 56:45.083
where your plans go to die.

56:45.166 --> 56:48.375
- A hospice for your dreams.

56:48.458 --> 56:50.542
- Palliative care
for your balls.

56:50.625 --> 56:52.667
At least then,
you have an excuse, right?

56:53.417 --> 56:55.417
(whispering):
Oh, it's my neighbour.

56:55.500 --> 56:58.250
Tracey! Come meet one of the
assholes I went to college with!

56:58.333 --> 57:00.792
- You make it sound so tempting.

57:00.875 --> 57:03.709
- This is Ken. Ken, Tracey.
Tracey, Ken.

57:03.792 --> 57:05.792
- Nice to meet you.

57:05.875 --> 57:07.375
- College, huh?

57:07.458 --> 57:09.375
Same sorority?

57:09.458 --> 57:11.709
(fake laughing)
- Oh, enjoy your humour.

57:11.792 --> 57:14.667
Why don't you ask your pimp
if you can come over for a beer?

57:15.959 --> 57:17.667
Rude.

57:17.750 --> 57:21.000
She's not really a hooker, but
she did just get divorced.

57:21.083 --> 57:22.667
- That's too bad.
- Too bad for him.

57:22.750 --> 57:27.500
I heard them a few times.
She's... enthusiastic.

57:27.583 --> 57:31.750
- That's kind of... cliché,
isn't it, the horny divorcee?

57:31.834 --> 57:35.000
- Buddy, all clichés are true.
That's just science.

57:35.083 --> 57:36.750
Anne doesn't really trust her.

57:36.834 --> 57:39.041
(phone chiming)
It kind of makes it hotter
for me.

57:40.959 --> 57:42.125
- Hmm.
- What? Good news?

57:42.208 --> 57:44.375
- Uh... Yeah.

57:44.458 --> 57:47.709
It's about my dad's... affairs.

57:47.792 --> 57:50.208
(baby crying)
- Cam, can you help? Sorry, Ken.

57:50.291 --> 57:51.500
- Oh, did he--
- Yeah, yeah.

57:51.583 --> 57:52.500
And then, he--
(makes farting noise)

57:52.583 --> 57:55.500
- Alright, get the thing
and I'll...

57:56.583 --> 57:59.542
Hey. Untouched
by the lips of man.

57:59.625 --> 58:01.542
- Know that feeling.

58:05.500 --> 58:06.834
(grunting)
- Here, you need help there,
buddy?

58:06.917 --> 58:09.917
- Yeah, I need help getting
in my own house. Fuck off.

58:10.000 --> 58:11.917
- Geez.

58:12.917 --> 58:15.291
- Oh, children.
- Yeah.

58:16.917 --> 58:19.333
- You got any?
- Uh, one, yeah.

58:19.417 --> 58:21.250
You wanna see a picture?

58:21.333 --> 58:22.834
- I'm good.

58:27.458 --> 58:28.917
Do you mind?

58:29.000 --> 58:31.875
- No, please.
It's your... neighbour's house.

58:33.417 --> 58:36.333
- They occasionally partake.

58:37.625 --> 58:40.709
- Oh, no. Thanks.
I'm married... uh, driving.

58:42.375 --> 58:43.875
- And a little Freudian.

58:45.208 --> 58:47.583
- Yeah.

58:47.667 --> 58:51.917
- I figure weed has prevented
more new parents from killing
their spawn than any other drug.

58:52.000 --> 58:53.500
- That sounds about right.

58:53.583 --> 58:56.709
I bet you acid's probably
a parenting non-starter.

58:56.792 --> 59:00.500
Oh, my kid has fangs! Kill it!

59:00.583 --> 59:02.458
Kill it!

59:02.542 --> 59:04.917
- You've never done acid,
have you?

59:05.000 --> 59:06.083
- I have not.

59:06.166 --> 59:08.917
Although I did buy fake ecstasy
at a rave once.

59:09.000 --> 59:10.750
Cleared my sinuses right up.

59:12.041 --> 59:14.291

Two college boyfriends.

59:52.667 --> 59:55.458
Yeah!
- Yeah, like old times.

59:55.542 --> 59:57.917
- No, don't.

59:58.000 --> 59:58.750
- Photo-bomb, motherfuckers!

59:58.834 --> 01:00:00.875
- What? You're ruining our
picture!

01:00:00.959 --> 01:00:02.166
- Yeah, she did actually
ruin it.
(grunting)

01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:05.542
- Did you get it? Hold on, hold
on. Are you okay to drive?

01:00:05.625 --> 01:00:08.208
- Yes, I'm okay. I'm brilliant.
Brilliant!

01:00:08.291 --> 01:00:09.166
- Brilliant!

01:00:09.250 --> 01:00:11.166
- But text us when you get
home. Alright?

01:00:11.250 --> 01:00:12.792
- Yes, mom.

01:00:12.875 --> 01:00:14.959
- And a big kiss to your wife,

01:00:15.041 --> 01:00:17.834
because she is so awesome.
- Aw!

01:00:17.917 --> 01:00:19.667
- Yes, she is.

01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:21.709
- Now, get off my lawn,
crazy kids.

01:00:21.792 --> 01:00:25.000
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Yes, get out.

01:00:25.083 --> 01:00:27.417
- Man, I needed this.

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.500
- One for the ride.

01:00:30.583 --> 01:00:31.583
- Oh...

01:00:31.667 --> 01:00:34.917
yeah, I don't know.
- What?

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.875
You think I'm trying to pass
you out and date-rape you?

01:00:38.959 --> 01:00:41.834
- Everybody knows that rape is
about power and not about sex.

01:00:41.917 --> 01:00:44.875
- Oh, God!
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:00:44.959 --> 01:00:48.041
Okay, one more would be
perfection.

01:00:48.125 --> 01:00:49.166
- Only one more.

01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:52.458
Because I wouldn't want
the neighbours to talk...

01:00:54.417 --> 01:00:58.583
- Okay, I just should move
my car so they don't worry.

01:00:58.667 --> 01:01:01.834
- Oh, look at you,
always thinking of others.

01:01:05.542 --> 01:01:07.834
(phone ringing)
- Oh...

01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:11.250
Argh...
- What?

01:01:11.333 --> 01:01:13.542
- My boss,

01:01:13.625 --> 01:01:16.667
passive-aggressive ninja.

01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:19.542
- What exactly is it that you do
again?

01:01:19.625 --> 01:01:21.458
- Uh... business-to-business
marketing

01:01:21.542 --> 01:01:24.542
for a small brewery special...
(fake snoring)

01:01:24.625 --> 01:01:26.709
Yeah.

01:01:26.792 --> 01:01:29.709
But don't you worry, lady.
I got other plans.

01:01:30.542 --> 01:01:33.917
- Why don't you just quit? Now?

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.875
(chuckling)
- What?

01:01:38.542 --> 01:01:41.083
- Use your largesse to strike
out on your own in the world.

01:01:41.166 --> 01:01:42.583
(Ken chuckling)

01:01:42.667 --> 01:01:43.917
- Yeah, I'm working on it.

01:01:47.041 --> 01:01:48.875
- Wait, what's the word?

01:01:50.792 --> 01:01:51.917
Meow!

01:01:55.583 --> 01:01:57.500
- It's not that easy.

01:01:57.583 --> 01:02:00.375
- I double dog dare you.

01:02:00.458 --> 01:02:02.583
- Are you kidding?

01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:07.000
There's like, stuff that I've--

01:02:07.083 --> 01:02:09.959
- I triple triple... triple
dog dare you.

01:02:12.458 --> 01:02:15.625
- Well, now it's fucking on.
That last dog just, you know...

01:02:15.709 --> 01:02:17.000
- Just put you over the edge.

01:02:18.625 --> 01:02:20.083
(clearing throat)

01:02:20.583 --> 01:02:22.625
- Hi, we're not here right now--

01:02:22.709 --> 01:02:24.750
- Oh, went straight
to voice mail.

01:02:24.834 --> 01:02:27.875
- Scorch the earth,
motherfucker.

01:02:31.041 --> 01:02:31.458
(clearing throat)

01:02:31.542 --> 01:02:35.166
- Hey, it's Ken.

01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:36.959
Wall, uh...

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
About that PowerPoint,
I'm not gonna...

01:02:41.083 --> 01:02:43.959
I'm not gonna get to do it
because...

01:02:45.625 --> 01:02:47.834
I quit.
(Tracey gasping)

01:02:47.917 --> 01:02:49.000
Yeah.

01:02:51.333 --> 01:02:53.041
Uh... I quit. So, uh...

01:02:55.583 --> 01:02:57.250
And someone should probably
tell you this, but...

01:02:57.333 --> 01:03:01.875
The way you micromanage
the entire business makes
everyone hate you

01:03:01.959 --> 01:03:04.000
and wastes the company
a ton of money.

01:03:04.083 --> 01:03:07.166
And also, stop with the fucking
hugging! Uh... oh, yeah.

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:09.792
And also, an aneurysm is not
a disease,

01:03:09.875 --> 01:03:12.792
so you can't have
a fun run for it.

01:03:12.875 --> 01:03:14.041
So, alright, uh...

01:03:15.583 --> 01:03:17.917
- Yes!
- Oh!

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.917
- How does it feel?
- Fuck!

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.041
Like I'm gonna throw up?

01:03:22.125 --> 01:03:23.291
Do you have any water?

01:03:23.375 --> 01:03:26.000
- Yeah.

01:03:32.333 --> 01:03:34.041
(sighing)

01:03:40.125 --> 01:03:43.709
(Tracey): So how is the wifey
gonna feel about this?

01:03:43.792 --> 01:03:46.083
- She can't get any madder
than she already is, so...

01:03:46.166 --> 01:03:47.792
Yeah.

01:03:47.875 --> 01:03:50.625
Before I left, she asked me
if I was dead inside.

01:03:54.542 --> 01:03:55.041
- Are you?

01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:00.667
- Uh... I mean...

01:04:01.333 --> 01:04:03.583
There's all these feelings

01:04:03.667 --> 01:04:07.083
that I am supposed to have
as a new dad.

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:12.875
And I want to feel them.

01:04:22.208 --> 01:04:27.875
My wife is actually
a really amazing woman.

01:04:32.333 --> 01:04:34.291
- Yet you're sitting here
drinking with a strange woman
late at night.

01:04:34.375 --> 01:04:36.208
- Yeah.

01:04:39.625 --> 01:04:42.792
- You know, Ken, marriage isn't
a "one size fits all" situation.

01:04:42.875 --> 01:04:44.959
- Does that mean
I should be a Mormon?

01:04:45.041 --> 01:04:46.667
(chuckling)

01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:48.917
- Maybe what you need is
a one-off.

01:04:55.875 --> 01:04:59.083
And just so you know,
she never has to.

01:05:11.417 --> 01:05:13.125
(honking)

01:05:22.333 --> 01:05:23.125
(laughing)

01:05:25.291 --> 01:05:26.375
- Hey!

01:05:26.458 --> 01:05:28.667
- Hey, Jeff.
What are you doing here?

01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:29.959
- You know, I called you,
like, 50 times.

01:05:30.041 --> 01:05:33.041
I figured some hood rat
must've popped you.

01:05:33.125 --> 01:05:35.333
I mean, the crime rate
these days is--

01:05:35.417 --> 01:05:37.208
- Actually way down. So--

01:05:37.291 --> 01:05:39.750
- So he called my number.
Sounds like karma.

01:05:39.834 --> 01:05:43.000
- Or directory assistance.

01:05:43.083 --> 01:05:45.166
- Do you realize I haven't seen
Jeff in 20 years?

01:05:45.250 --> 01:05:49.250
- Really? So back
to my original question.

01:05:49.333 --> 01:05:51.959
- Little wrinkle
with your escape plan, Jacko.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.333
Your janitor friend... is lying.

01:05:55.417 --> 01:05:57.166
- So exciting.

01:05:57.250 --> 01:05:59.709
It's just like an episode
of Law and Order.

01:05:59.792 --> 01:06:03.083
The original one. I don't care
for the sexual assaults.

01:06:03.166 --> 01:06:06.250
Anybody wants some wine?
- Does a rabbi work for tips?

01:06:06.333 --> 01:06:08.709
Take a look at the grass.
You see what I mean?

01:06:08.792 --> 01:06:10.792
- Yeah. Now that it's bigger.

01:06:10.875 --> 01:06:13.208
- And the ashes.
- Wrong colour.

01:06:13.291 --> 01:06:16.083
Andy was more light gray.
- Your mom has a keen eye.

01:06:16.166 --> 01:06:18.250
- Why would he do that?
- Well, that is the question.

01:06:18.333 --> 01:06:21.208
What was the particular make
of your janitor?

01:06:21.291 --> 01:06:22.250
(Ken and Eve): Make?

01:06:22.333 --> 01:06:23.959
- Oh, come on, Mr. PC.

01:06:24.041 --> 01:06:25.166
Was he a recent arrival
to our fair country?

01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:28.625
Did he have a preponderance
of consonants in his name?

01:06:28.709 --> 01:06:31.917
Was he wearing a head covering
that was religious
and not decorative in nature?

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.166
- Jeff, you're so verbal!

01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:36.834
- Yeah, a verbal racist.
Oh, what are we gonna do?

01:06:36.917 --> 01:06:39.709
- Well, I'll tell you what...

01:06:39.792 --> 01:06:42.041
you call him and you tell him...

01:06:42.834 --> 01:06:44.709
I don't know what you tell him.

01:06:44.792 --> 01:06:46.166
You tell him you need the box
back for insurance purposes.

01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:49.750
Then, we get his locale,
we go pay him a visit.

01:06:49.834 --> 01:06:51.250
- Excellent idea.
- Thank you, lady Eve.

01:06:53.709 --> 01:06:56.041
- Okay, okay.

01:06:56.125 --> 01:06:59.875
I can't think about this right
now. I gotta go to sleep.

01:07:00.333 --> 01:07:03.250
Thanks for the info.
We'll figure it out tomorrow.

01:07:03.333 --> 01:07:05.208
I'm gonna crash.

01:07:07.083 --> 01:07:09.166
- Good night.
- Yeah.

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:11.417
- Okay, well, I guess...

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:13.250
I guess I should mosey.

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:17.375
- Yeah, it's late.

01:07:22.041 --> 01:07:26.083
So how's your night vision?
- I get by.

01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:28.458
- I bet you do.

01:07:29.083 --> 01:07:30.792
- You know, I remember
when we first met,

01:07:30.875 --> 01:07:33.875
it was... a wedding at the club.

01:07:33.959 --> 01:07:36.458
And Andy pointed you out to me
and I thought: Oh, my God.

01:07:37.291 --> 01:07:39.000
That was my best friend's
ex-wife.
- Stop.

01:07:39.083 --> 01:07:41.250
- You were wearing
that little blue dress

01:07:41.333 --> 01:07:43.583
with a button at the top
that just wouldn't stay

01:07:43.667 --> 01:07:45.250
buttoned.
(grunting)

01:07:47.583 --> 01:07:50.208
Oh!

01:07:51.959 --> 01:07:52.333
(phone ringing)

01:07:57.875 --> 01:08:00.667
- Hey.
- Good morning, sleepyhead.

01:08:00.750 --> 01:08:03.125
- How you doing?

01:08:03.208 --> 01:08:04.834
- Amazing.

01:08:04.917 --> 01:08:06.792
Your son actually slept
through the night.

01:08:06.875 --> 01:08:08.375
- Oh, good.

01:08:08.458 --> 01:08:10.959
- Unlike someone
who looks a bit rough.

01:08:11.041 --> 01:08:14.500
- Yeah, I didn't get the...

01:08:14.583 --> 01:08:16.332
best sleep, so...

01:08:16.417 --> 01:08:19.500
- Yeah, did your new friend
Tracey keep you up?

01:08:23.834 --> 01:08:25.332
- What?

01:08:25.417 --> 01:08:29.457
- Tall, brunette, looks like
a Romanian sex worker.

01:08:29.542 --> 01:08:31.375
- Tracey... Oh, Cam's neighbour.

01:08:31.457 --> 01:08:35.417
Uh, yeah, she stopped by.
How did you...

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:36.875
- Anne posted a photo
on Facebook.

01:08:36.959 --> 01:08:39.375
You look nice and toasty.

01:08:39.457 --> 01:08:42.166
- Oh, no, she was...
yeah, she was fun.

01:08:42.250 --> 01:08:46.125
It was, I mean, it was
good to see Cam and...

01:08:46.207 --> 01:08:47.082
- It looked like fun

01:08:47.166 --> 01:08:51.500
and I'm glad you got to...
go out.

01:08:54.125 --> 01:08:56.875
Sorry I haven't been
really fun lately.

01:08:56.959 --> 01:09:00.125
- No, no. I'm the one
in my own universe.

01:09:00.207 --> 01:09:03.041
I was such an asshole.
I'm sorry.

01:09:03.125 --> 01:09:06.000
- No. I was a total bitch.
- No, I was the bitch.

01:09:06.082 --> 01:09:10.875
I'm a super bitch.
(Lori laughing)

01:09:12.457 --> 01:09:15.250
- Speaking of bitches,
your boss called last night

01:09:15.332 --> 01:09:18.792
and left a weird message
on our machine.

01:09:18.875 --> 01:09:20.125
- Fuck.

01:09:20.625 --> 01:09:22.250
I mean... okay.

01:09:22.332 --> 01:09:25.082
- Hey, so when's your flight?
- Uh...

01:09:25.166 --> 01:09:28.291
(phone ringing)
Hold on one second.

01:09:28.625 --> 01:09:30.166
Where are you?

01:09:31.542 --> 01:09:33.834
Oh, sweetie,
I gotta get this real quick.

01:09:33.917 --> 01:09:36.750
- Sure, sure.
If it's my new sister wife,
tell her I said, "Whaddup!"

01:09:36.834 --> 01:09:37.582
- Ha-ha-ha. Not funny.

01:09:37.667 --> 01:09:40.082
I love you.

01:09:40.166 --> 01:09:41.959
- Alright, "shame spiral".
Get some coffee.

01:09:42.041 --> 01:09:42.417
- Okay, bye.

01:09:44.291 --> 01:09:45.834
Hey, this is Ken.

01:09:45.917 --> 01:09:47.959
Yeah.

01:09:48.041 --> 01:09:50.207
Yes, the one with the ashes.

01:09:51.417 --> 01:09:54.000
Do you have other people
that have ashes?

01:09:58.834 --> 01:10:01.208
(cheerful jazz music)

01:10:06.333 --> 01:10:07.542
(sighing)

01:10:19.959 --> 01:10:21.208
Jeff?

01:10:24.208 --> 01:10:26.000
- Hey.

01:10:26.083 --> 01:10:27.959
- What...
Didn't you get my text?

01:10:28.041 --> 01:10:29.041
We're supposed to meet there.

01:10:29.125 --> 01:10:32.250
- Yeah, uh, sorry. Just, uh...

01:10:32.333 --> 01:10:35.333
It's kind of a senior moment.
And...

01:10:35.417 --> 01:10:36.458
And I came here.

01:10:43.333 --> 01:10:45.291
Want to car pool?

01:10:45.375 --> 01:10:47.208
- Uh, uh... sure.

01:10:47.291 --> 01:10:50.291
- Yeah, great.
Let's go together.

01:10:50.375 --> 01:10:52.667
- Weren't you... Were you
wearing that yesterday?

01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:55.291
- No.

01:10:56.583 --> 01:10:59.041
So you just quit over the phone.

01:10:59.125 --> 01:11:01.667
- Yeah, I'm so screwed.

01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:02.959
Lori's gonna kill me.

01:11:03.041 --> 01:11:06.291
To my defense, there was a lot
of weed and alcohol involved.

01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:08.667
- Well, if weed and alcohol
were a defense,

01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:11.000
I'd be the CEO of Halliburton
right now.

01:11:11.083 --> 01:11:14.125
Don't sweat it, kid.
If Andy's ashes are in there,
we'll make it right.

01:11:15.208 --> 01:11:16.625
- Oh.

01:11:18.667 --> 01:11:21.083
Hey.

01:11:21.166 --> 01:11:22.375
Who's the nut?

01:11:23.166 --> 01:11:26.667
- Uh, this is my friend, Jeff.

01:11:29.166 --> 01:11:31.667
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:33.458
- Nice to meet you.

01:11:35.125 --> 01:11:37.875
20 bucks for my time, eh?
- Yeah.

01:11:37.959 --> 01:11:41.291
- Okay, come on in!

01:11:46.291 --> 01:11:48.125
- Wow. Nice.

01:11:53.792 --> 01:11:57.041
(truck rumbling outside)
(loudly): Yeah, so about
that photo you sent...

01:11:57.125 --> 01:11:59.709
(janitor, loudly): Yeah,
it's tough to do a selfie

01:11:59.792 --> 01:12:01.750
with a dead body, or a bag,
I guess.

01:12:01.834 --> 01:12:03.458
- Yeah.

01:12:03.542 --> 01:12:06.667
Yeah, I don't think
you'd actually know.

01:12:11.417 --> 01:12:13.333
- I don't follow.

01:12:13.417 --> 01:12:15.208
- You see, the...

01:12:15.291 --> 01:12:18.583
the field in that photo

01:12:18.667 --> 01:12:21.291
was the wrong colour.

01:12:21.375 --> 01:12:23.375
Astroturf has...

01:12:24.250 --> 01:12:26.333
has a certain
blue-ish hue to it.

01:12:26.417 --> 01:12:30.041
(dog barking in the distance)
And...

01:12:31.041 --> 01:12:33.166
unlike the...

01:12:33.250 --> 01:12:35.417
yard of a dog owner,

01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:38.208
there's not any brown spots
where the dog...

01:12:38.291 --> 01:12:39.625
- Shits.

01:12:39.709 --> 01:12:42.458
And the consistency
of the alleged ashes

01:12:42.542 --> 01:12:45.583
reminds one of say,
litter of the kitty.

01:12:48.250 --> 01:12:50.083
- Man, I'm sorry.

01:12:50.166 --> 01:12:52.291
I was gonna do it, but they got
cameras all over the stadium.

01:12:52.375 --> 01:12:55.667
- Just tell me you still have
the ashes.

01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:58.417
- I actually was gonna just
put them in the yard,

01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:00.458
but this is a human being
we're talking about,

01:13:00.542 --> 01:13:02.625
a person who lived,
who loved--

01:13:02.709 --> 01:13:05.625
- Yeah, who pooped and cried.
Yeah, we get it.
Where's our pen salesman?

01:13:05.709 --> 01:13:07.417
- My wife and I thought we
should put him in a cemetery.

01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:09.375
There's a big tree
by where my Nana's buried.

01:13:09.458 --> 01:13:12.291
We go up there
every other week.

01:13:12.375 --> 01:13:15.333
- The remains,
mop-jockey, Jesus H.
- Sorry, they gotta be here!

01:13:17.667 --> 01:13:18.625
- Ask for your money back.

01:13:20.709 --> 01:13:22.667
- Yeah, he meant well.

01:13:22.750 --> 01:13:24.625
- Well, okay, but it kind of
sets a precedent.

01:13:25.875 --> 01:13:28.542
- For what?

01:13:28.625 --> 01:13:31.417
Unlawful dumping
of human remains?

01:13:34.417 --> 01:13:37.625
- Hey, is your mom always so...

01:13:37.709 --> 01:13:40.750
- ...obsessed with death?
No, that's a new thing.

01:13:40.834 --> 01:13:42.250
- I was gonna say "forward".

01:13:42.333 --> 01:13:45.000
- What are you talking about?

01:13:45.083 --> 01:13:47.166
- Ah, forget it, then.

01:13:47.250 --> 01:13:49.458
I just wonder if I need a trip
to the clinic.

01:13:53.583 --> 01:13:54.625
- Did you...

01:13:55.583 --> 01:13:56.834
Wait, after I...

01:13:56.917 --> 01:13:58.000
Did you fuck my mom?

01:13:58.083 --> 01:14:01.083
- Hey, I told you, man.
We all grieve in our own way.

01:14:01.166 --> 01:14:04.333
- No, I bet very few of us
grieve by sleeping
with my mother,

01:14:04.417 --> 01:14:06.125
and then, worrying
that they have STDs.

01:14:06.208 --> 01:14:07.583
- Ken, cool your jets! I'm not
gonna start calling you "son".

01:14:07.667 --> 01:14:10.583
You don't have to buy me a card
on Father's Day.

01:14:10.667 --> 01:14:12.875
We're not gonna go
have a catch.

01:14:12.959 --> 01:14:15.291
But, by the way, there was
very little sleeping going on,
if you follow.

01:14:15.375 --> 01:14:17.625
- Got it!

01:14:17.709 --> 01:14:22.500
I put the bag in an empty cereal
box, but that's where we
normally keep the kitty litter.

01:14:22.583 --> 01:14:26.417
So I'm thinking the wife. She's
at work right now, but she's--

01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:27.542
- For the love of God, man.

01:14:27.625 --> 01:14:30.667
- They're probably outside
in the trash bin.

01:14:32.417 --> 01:14:33.709
(uptempo music)

01:14:35.583 --> 01:14:37.750
- Hey, Batman and Robin.

01:14:37.834 --> 01:14:40.125
You still owe me 20 bucks.

01:14:40.208 --> 01:14:41.834
- Hey, hey, wait!

01:14:43.667 --> 01:14:44.625
Hey, hey!

01:14:47.959 --> 01:14:50.834
Hey! Hey!

01:14:53.208 --> 01:14:55.709
Hey, hey!

01:14:55.792 --> 01:14:57.417
Stop the truck!

01:14:57.500 --> 01:14:59.333
(Ken hitting the floor)
(grunting)

01:14:59.417 --> 01:15:03.375
(mumbling in foreign language)

01:15:06.583 --> 01:15:08.917
- What the hell is going on?
- Sir!

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.750
We need to get into the back
of your truck!
- For why?

01:15:13.583 --> 01:15:16.625
- There's a baby in there.
- Oh, my God!

01:15:16.709 --> 01:15:19.291
- It crawled into a trash bag
and fell asleep.

01:15:19.375 --> 01:15:21.291
- Holy shit! Call 9-1-1.

01:15:21.375 --> 01:15:23.458
Call 9-1-1.
(Ken, grunting): No baby.
There's no baby in there.

01:15:23.542 --> 01:15:24.709
- Well, it's a puppy.
A dog baby.

01:15:24.792 --> 01:15:27.875
- There's no puppy.
It's not a puppy baby.
(panting)

01:15:27.959 --> 01:15:31.500
So, this is what a concussion
feels like.

01:15:31.583 --> 01:15:35.333
Sir, we just need to get
into the back of your truck
to retrieve something.

01:15:35.417 --> 01:15:37.583
- This is a storage unit?

01:15:37.667 --> 01:15:40.208
For you to retrieve,
there are many regulations.

01:15:40.291 --> 01:15:42.500
- Well, was it regulations you
ran down my friend here?

01:15:42.583 --> 01:15:45.834
- What are you accusing me of?
- We're not accusing you
of anything, sir.

01:15:45.917 --> 01:15:47.792
- Ivan, can I call you Ivan?
- Ivan.

01:15:47.875 --> 01:15:50.458
- My Slavic friend, you tell me
what I have to do

01:15:50.542 --> 01:15:52.917
to put us
in the back of that truck today.

01:15:53.667 --> 01:15:55.959
(Ken): You guys see the stars?

01:15:57.041 --> 01:16:00.875
- You like that?
It won't take us long.
- No.

01:16:02.417 --> 01:16:05.041
- Hi! My God, what happened?

01:16:05.125 --> 01:16:08.834
- Mom, what are you doing here?
- What?! I don't get a "me" day?

01:16:08.917 --> 01:16:11.083
- Yeah, a little bump
on the noggin. He's alright.

01:16:11.166 --> 01:16:12.625
- Did you find Andy?

01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:15.917
- Oh, yeah.
He's in the corn flake box.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.875
Jeff told the garbage man
about the dead puppies.

01:16:17.959 --> 01:16:20.458
So now, we're back
at square uno.

01:16:20.542 --> 01:16:24.917
- You think you could keep up
this spacey looking, drooling
idiot bit a little while longer?

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.542
- I think I have an actual
head injury.

01:16:26.625 --> 01:16:29.625
I should probably go
to the hospital.

01:16:29.709 --> 01:16:31.834
- Kids, these days.

01:16:31.917 --> 01:16:34.875
- Your uncle lost a foot
in a combine accident once.
He never made a peep.

01:16:34.959 --> 01:16:37.917
- Because maybe that's our play.
There's a saying
in the sales game:

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.667
A man in a good suit can get
almost anywhere

01:16:40.750 --> 01:16:42.333
if he walks with confidence.

01:16:42.417 --> 01:16:44.625
- More than anywhere.
- Do you know any gimps?

01:16:45.750 --> 01:16:47.125
What, like, otherly gifted.
Hello, anybody home?

01:16:47.208 --> 01:16:51.792
- A person with
activity limitation is
what we call them at work.

01:16:51.875 --> 01:16:53.750
- Okay.
- Like his oldest friend, Cam.

01:16:53.834 --> 01:16:55.709
He's been in a wheelchair
his whole life.

01:16:55.792 --> 01:16:59.458
- Now, that's the best news
I've heard all day.

01:17:01.542 --> 01:17:05.834
- I just want you to know
that I know how incredibly
offensive this is.

01:17:05.917 --> 01:17:08.959
Just say the word
and I won't do it.

01:17:09.917 --> 01:17:13.709
- Good. I'm glad you came
to your senses.

01:17:13.792 --> 01:17:16.458
Do you realize
how insensitive this is?

01:17:17.667 --> 01:17:19.917
- Yeah, man. I'm sorry.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.959
(laughing)
- I'm just shitting you, man.

01:17:22.041 --> 01:17:24.500
Take it, you fucking
wannabe able-ist.

01:17:24.583 --> 01:17:26.834
- Are you serious?
- Oh, yeah. No, dude.
I love this.

01:17:26.917 --> 01:17:28.250
People are terrified
of these things.

01:17:28.333 --> 01:17:32.000
I free-rolled into more concerts
than you can imagine.
- You have?

01:17:32.083 --> 01:17:32.959
- Young Jeezy.
First row.

01:17:33.041 --> 01:17:35.542
He was like, "Get on stage!"
I was like,

01:17:35.625 --> 01:17:37.542
"Uh, there's no ramp."
But it was like, a nice...

01:17:37.625 --> 01:17:39.875
it was nice of him
to invite him.

01:17:39.959 --> 01:17:42.625
Look, I got you this.
It might help.

01:17:42.709 --> 01:17:45.792
- What is this?
- I'm a fixer, buddy.
Solve your problems.

01:17:45.875 --> 01:17:47.917
- You're the best.
- That's true.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.583
- I love you.
- Alright, man. Go out there
and make me proud.

01:17:49.667 --> 01:17:52.458
- Alright, I will.
- Goddamn criminal.

01:17:52.542 --> 01:17:55.375
Remember not to move your legs.

01:17:57.041 --> 01:17:58.041
- Shit...

01:18:00.375 --> 01:18:04.875
- You know, I usually have men
bolt out of my house
after the fact.

01:18:04.959 --> 01:18:06.333
Not before.

01:18:06.417 --> 01:18:09.583
- Yeah. Sorry about that.

01:18:09.667 --> 01:18:11.041
- It's okay.

01:18:11.125 --> 01:18:14.125
You're a good guy.
There's not a lot of you around.

01:18:14.208 --> 01:18:15.542
- Well...

01:18:15.625 --> 01:18:19.750
it was 50-50 there
for a second.

01:18:19.834 --> 01:18:20.834
- No, it wasn't.

01:18:20.917 --> 01:18:24.417
Although,
you would've had a lot of fun.

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:27.458
I do a lot of Cirque du Soleil
kind of stuff.

01:18:27.542 --> 01:18:29.875
And I'm seriously good at it.

01:18:34.625 --> 01:18:37.542
- Well, that was just mean.

01:18:43.875 --> 01:18:45.750
Pop it, Jeff!

01:18:56.792 --> 01:18:58.917
No, no, that's okay. I got it.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.542
- God, your mom is so flexible.

01:19:05.792 --> 01:19:09.291
- Okay. You ready?
- Almost.

01:19:09.375 --> 01:19:10.917
- Hey! What the fuck?

01:19:15.125 --> 01:19:17.959
- You gotta trust me.
God is in the details.

01:19:19.417 --> 01:19:21.583
Just watch and learn.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.583
Excuse me, young lady,
that is a gorgeous blouse.

01:19:28.667 --> 01:19:31.083
Did you know this morning
when you got up

01:19:31.166 --> 01:19:32.583
how it would just
make your eyes pop?

01:19:32.667 --> 01:19:34.834
- Uh, how can I help you?

01:19:34.917 --> 01:19:38.125
- We are here to see John Travis
in special events.

01:19:38.208 --> 01:19:39.375
Can you tell him
Reggie Treehorne

01:19:39.458 --> 01:19:42.000
and his special friend from
Rolling for the Cure are here?

01:19:44.834 --> 01:19:47.583
(whispering): Remember,
you're mute.

01:19:47.667 --> 01:19:49.458
- Remember,
it's not Rolling for the Cure.

01:19:49.542 --> 01:19:52.500
It's Roll for the Cure.
Look at the fucking T-shirt.

01:19:52.583 --> 01:19:54.750
(receptionist): Uh, sorry.
He's still at lunch.

01:19:54.834 --> 01:19:56.542
- Oh, did I get the time...

01:19:56.625 --> 01:19:59.083
Oh! Yeah, that's my bad.

01:19:59.166 --> 01:20:01.542
Uh, well, perhaps
we could wait in his office.

01:20:01.625 --> 01:20:03.125
- I can't let you back there.

01:20:03.208 --> 01:20:05.917
- You know, I'm just not sure
you want the optics

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.834
of a special person
loitering in the...

01:20:08.917 --> 01:20:11.917
in the waiting area.
You know what I mean?

01:20:14.542 --> 01:20:15.375
- Sir.

01:20:15.458 --> 01:20:17.542
- It's a corporate image
kind of thing,

01:20:17.625 --> 01:20:19.792
but if you're okay with that,
I'm okay with that.

01:20:20.875 --> 01:20:22.625
We'll be right over here.

01:20:23.959 --> 01:20:25.875
Now.
- Hmm...?

01:20:25.959 --> 01:20:28.083
(grunting loudly)

01:20:28.166 --> 01:20:31.000
Oh!
- Is he okay?

01:20:31.083 --> 01:20:32.834
- Uh, you know, I don't know.

01:20:33.792 --> 01:20:34.959
Oh!

01:20:35.041 --> 01:20:37.083
Oh, he may need a bathroom.

01:20:37.166 --> 01:20:39.792
(sniffing)
Yeah, yeah, without question.

01:20:39.875 --> 01:20:41.000
- The only bathroom we have
is back there.

01:20:41.083 --> 01:20:43.792
- You know, that's okay.
I've got wet wipes.

01:20:43.875 --> 01:20:45.917
If you could just...
just get his belt for me.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.792
And be careful, you know,
you think adult diapers are
full on water-tight,

01:20:48.875 --> 01:20:51.208
but I've had some nasty
surprises in my day.
Haven't I, pal?

01:20:51.291 --> 01:20:52.333
(grunting)

01:20:52.417 --> 01:20:56.083
They call him the brown firehose
down at the centre.

01:20:56.166 --> 01:20:59.667
It's not because of his dick.
Thank you.
(Ken grunting)

01:21:02.875 --> 01:21:04.917
We're gonna need
more toilet paper.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.083
- Someone just checked
this morning--
- No, damn it, woman.

01:21:07.166 --> 01:21:09.959
This is not a drill.
We're in shit-con four.
You need to hustle up

01:21:10.041 --> 01:21:13.625
a pallet of double ply in a
hurry or you're gonna need to
repaint the whole bathroom.

01:21:13.709 --> 01:21:14.083
Is that what you want,
to repaint?

01:21:16.792 --> 01:21:18.667
Okay.

01:21:20.959 --> 01:21:23.166
(sighing)
- You are pretty good at this.

01:21:23.250 --> 01:21:24.125
- You should see me
with an angry husband

01:21:24.208 --> 01:21:26.792
when I'm nut-to-cheek
with his old lady.

01:21:26.875 --> 01:21:28.917
Come on, buddy, you got
all the time you need.

01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:40.250
(inspirational music)

01:21:50.250 --> 01:21:52.792
(Jeff): And I know
most guys would disagree,

01:21:52.875 --> 01:21:55.125
but I found something
incredibly erotic

01:21:55.208 --> 01:21:58.667
about control top undergarments.
You know, holding so much back.

01:21:58.750 --> 01:22:01.041
But I'm taking about the bustier
as a metaphor
for aspirations of the heart.

01:22:15.250 --> 01:22:18.208
(Jeff): It's funny
when you think about it.
I mean, the more you...

01:22:18.291 --> 01:22:21.000
the more you sort of
invite stuff to happen...
- I like it.

01:22:21.083 --> 01:22:24.250
- ...the more it can happen.
Do you know what I mean?
- Sure.

01:22:24.333 --> 01:22:27.041
- He's gonna need a seltzer,
I think.

01:22:36.834 --> 01:22:38.959
- Alright, bud.

01:22:39.041 --> 01:22:41.125
(uplifting music)

01:22:53.458 --> 01:22:55.625
(music stops)
(woman sighing)

01:22:55.709 --> 01:22:57.792
- Balls.

01:23:00.291 --> 01:23:02.166
(sighing)
Security?

01:23:02.625 --> 01:23:05.208
(tense music)

01:23:21.834 --> 01:23:24.166
(spitting)
(grunting)

01:23:28.166 --> 01:23:29.875
(grunting)

01:23:38.208 --> 01:23:40.875
- Do I have to get a Hazmat team
out here?

01:23:40.959 --> 01:23:42.041
- No.

01:23:42.125 --> 01:23:45.166
Like I said,
I'm not a terrorist.

01:23:45.250 --> 01:23:48.083
- Prove it. Make him eat some.
- How would that...

01:23:48.166 --> 01:23:50.917
I'm not going to eat
my dad's ashes.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.750
- See?
- See what?

01:23:53.834 --> 01:23:55.417
That I'm not a necro-cannibal?

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.041
- Okay, let's say that's true.

01:23:59.125 --> 01:24:01.417
- That would be nice.

01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:04.166
- You get why we can't have
people throwing human remains
on the playing surface?

01:24:04.250 --> 01:24:06.750
Hygiene, workplace
health and safety.

01:24:06.834 --> 01:24:09.500
You know, I started here
in high school.

01:24:09.583 --> 01:24:11.875
We've had drunks, streakers,

01:24:11.959 --> 01:24:15.875
a Morganna the Kissing Bandit
wannabe, but...

01:24:18.208 --> 01:24:19.750
never a corpse.

01:24:20.375 --> 01:24:22.208
- It was his dying wish.

01:24:22.583 --> 01:24:24.000
He, uh...

01:24:24.083 --> 01:24:27.917
gave up season tickets
for me and my mom.

01:24:28.917 --> 01:24:30.458
- What was your old man's name?

01:24:30.542 --> 01:24:33.291
- Andy Wall.

01:24:33.375 --> 01:24:36.000
- So a real fan, huh?

01:24:36.083 --> 01:24:39.125
- Why else would you want
large men

01:24:39.208 --> 01:24:43.083
bleeding and sweating all over
your final resting place?

01:24:51.083 --> 01:24:52.333
Why do you have
a picture of my dad?

01:24:54.917 --> 01:24:59.458
- I've never seen someone
that drunk run that fast.

01:25:00.917 --> 01:25:03.125
We figured he was trying
to piss on the team logo.

01:25:03.208 --> 01:25:06.000
To explain why his penis
was exposed.

01:25:06.333 --> 01:25:10.125
Although, we were 3 and 15
that year. So...

01:25:10.208 --> 01:25:11.208
I get the impulse.

01:25:15.166 --> 01:25:17.458
- You gotta be kidding me.

01:25:23.458 --> 01:25:25.917
- Your old man
could really hold a grudge.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.083
(knocking on door)

01:25:30.917 --> 01:25:33.041
- Well, do we need to evacuate?

01:25:33.125 --> 01:25:36.375
- Hmm... I think
we're good here.

01:25:39.041 --> 01:25:39.375
(door closing)

01:25:44.208 --> 01:25:45.375
Voluntary lifetime ban.

01:26:02.625 --> 01:26:03.375
Just like your old man.

01:26:17.458 --> 01:26:19.166
Hey, hey.

01:26:20.417 --> 01:26:23.166
You want to leave him out in the
parking lot by a sewer grate?

01:26:23.250 --> 01:26:25.125
We could turn a blind eye.

01:26:25.208 --> 01:26:26.291
- He obviously liked
to tailgate.

01:26:34.291 --> 01:26:37.291
- Hey, what hap-- Oh, God!
What?

01:26:37.375 --> 01:26:39.583
- He gave up the tickets
for his family, huh?

01:26:39.667 --> 01:26:40.750
- Oh, hey! Calm down!

01:26:40.834 --> 01:26:44.667
- The one decent thing I thought
he ever did is bullshit.

01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:48.083
- Look, he hoped the ashes
would maybe curse the team
for the rest of time.

01:26:48.166 --> 01:26:50.208
And in his defense,
his pain meds were kicking in
pretty good.

01:26:50.291 --> 01:26:53.375
You should hear
what I talked him out of.

01:26:53.458 --> 01:26:56.333
- Did he tell you to lie to me?
- It was an agreed upon
approach.

01:26:56.417 --> 01:26:59.291
I mean, if the money
didn't hook you,
we had the old heart-strings.

01:26:59.375 --> 01:27:01.667
- Does my mom know?
- What?

01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:03.542
Don't blame it on your mom.
She wanted you to have
one nice memory of your dad.

01:27:05.166 --> 01:27:07.375
- See you around, Jeff.

01:27:07.458 --> 01:27:10.125
- Hey! Where are you going?
You don't have a job.

01:27:10.208 --> 01:27:11.959
You need to do this.

01:27:12.041 --> 01:27:14.542
- Yeah, I wouldn't scatter
his ashes for a million dollars.

01:27:14.625 --> 01:27:18.417
- Oh, yeah. So you're just gonna
let the golf club build
a new steam room.

01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:19.458
Look, I can't defend the guy.

01:27:19.542 --> 01:27:22.542
But, you know,
I care about the old jackass.

01:27:22.625 --> 01:27:24.542
- Yeah, well,
that makes one of us.

01:27:24.625 --> 01:27:25.959
- Let me explain something
to you.

01:27:26.041 --> 01:27:31.083
Your dad was not proud
of some of the choices
he made in his life.

01:27:31.166 --> 01:27:34.250
And his biggest regret was
his estrangement from you.

01:27:35.709 --> 01:27:38.291
And the afternoon
he told me about it...

01:27:39.291 --> 01:27:42.000
I mean, it just broke my heart.

01:27:44.583 --> 01:27:46.166
- Fuck you.

01:27:46.250 --> 01:27:47.583
- Oh, I gave it a shot.
But fuck what he wants.

01:27:47.667 --> 01:27:52.125
And fuck that dumb part of your
ego that wants to spite him.

01:27:52.208 --> 01:27:54.000
Fuck your pride
two times on Sunday!

01:27:54.083 --> 01:27:56.166
Just fucking be
the better man!

01:27:57.125 --> 01:27:59.041
Or 20 years from now,

01:27:59.125 --> 01:28:01.375
you can look back on your life,
whatever it is you do,

01:28:01.458 --> 01:28:04.667
and you'll be able to say,
"Wow, was I ever a pussy!"

01:28:04.750 --> 01:28:07.375
- Yeah, well, at least
I'm a pussy who can provide
for his family.

01:28:07.458 --> 01:28:09.542
- Or a pussy who drinks himself
to sleep every night

01:28:09.625 --> 01:28:11.959
and starts banging
his overweight secretary

01:28:12.041 --> 01:28:14.542
just because her muted cries
of ecstasy from the copy room

01:28:14.625 --> 01:28:16.375
are the only thing that make him
feel half-alive.

01:28:17.542 --> 01:28:20.250
- Well, that was...
was really specific.

01:28:20.333 --> 01:28:23.542
- Because that's the way
it always happens.

01:28:23.625 --> 01:28:26.250
Your family can't be happy
unless you're happy.

01:28:26.333 --> 01:28:28.583
And you, my son, are one
mopey fuck.

01:28:31.375 --> 01:28:33.542
So your dad had me lie to you.

01:28:33.625 --> 01:28:35.625
You wanted to know more
about him?

01:28:35.709 --> 01:28:37.709
Well, maybe that's all
there is to know.

01:28:37.792 --> 01:28:39.500
So fucking what?

01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:42.208
Life is a series of trade-offs.

01:28:42.291 --> 01:28:44.750
And they don't all have
to be bad.

01:28:44.834 --> 01:28:47.333
Just...

01:28:48.208 --> 01:28:50.333
get this done.

01:28:50.417 --> 01:28:53.333
And then,
don't think about him again.

01:28:58.375 --> 01:29:01.542
- We were really close,
weren't we?

01:29:01.625 --> 01:29:02.750
- Yes!

01:29:02.834 --> 01:29:04.458
- You know, right on the field.

01:29:04.542 --> 01:29:07.291
- Inches from greatness.

01:29:07.667 --> 01:29:08.792
- Inches.
- Inches.

01:29:08.875 --> 01:29:13.166
As the ladies always tell me.
I kid. I get the job done.

01:29:17.041 --> 01:29:19.709
(plane whizzing by)

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.542
(grunting)
Come on!

01:29:25.834 --> 01:29:27.750
- What time is it?

01:29:31.875 --> 01:29:33.583
Got you.

01:29:36.291 --> 01:29:36.667
Oh, fuck.

01:29:36.750 --> 01:29:39.375
Uh...

01:29:40.667 --> 01:29:42.583
(uptempo music)

01:29:47.250 --> 01:29:48.709
(Ken): What time is it?

01:29:48.792 --> 01:29:51.000
(Jeff): Society really started
going the wrong way

01:29:51.083 --> 01:29:53.750
when they took prayer
out of schools. And then,
stopped wearing watches.

01:29:53.834 --> 01:29:54.625
(Ken): Can we focus, please?

01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:55.625
(Jeff): You really got
15 minutes?

01:29:58.583 --> 01:30:01.125
(man on video): If we're
a little bit too sensitive,

01:30:01.208 --> 01:30:03.000
you're gonna be
all over the place.

01:30:03.083 --> 01:30:05.625
So what you need to do
is you need to...
(indistinct)

01:30:05.709 --> 01:30:06.959
...so that you're not gonna be
flying all over...

01:30:07.041 --> 01:30:10.709
- Alright, I think I got this.
Alright. I need my dad's phone.

01:30:10.792 --> 01:30:11.959
- What?
- I need my dad's phone.

01:30:12.041 --> 01:30:15.041
I gotta tape it to the plane
so we could live stream it.

01:30:15.125 --> 01:30:17.125
- No. I'd really hate to burn
the roll over minutes.

01:30:17.208 --> 01:30:19.250
- Give me the phone.

01:30:21.583 --> 01:30:26.125
What's Vince's e-mail?
- Littleflatstick69@aol.com

01:30:27.333 --> 01:30:29.542
- Okay. Flip that over.

01:30:34.709 --> 01:30:37.125
Okay, Dad. Let's go.

01:30:37.208 --> 01:30:37.917
Put it right there.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.500
Here, hold this.

01:30:44.667 --> 01:30:46.792
Alright, we got power.
Here we go.

01:30:47.834 --> 01:30:49.500
There we go. Come on, come on.

01:30:49.583 --> 01:30:50.792
Oh!
- You're up, you're up.

01:30:54.834 --> 01:30:58.333
- Alright! Come on, baby.
Alright, oh!

01:30:58.417 --> 01:31:00.375
We got it.

01:31:00.458 --> 01:31:02.208
This is easy.
Wait, wait. It's going around.

01:31:02.291 --> 01:31:04.333
- It's coming right at us!
Oh, whoa!

01:31:04.417 --> 01:31:06.208
- Alright, come on.

01:31:06.291 --> 01:31:08.583
- Just stop moving!
- Alright, I'm not.
- Uh-oh!

01:31:08.667 --> 01:31:10.458
- There we go.
- Oh! That's a straight line.

01:31:10.542 --> 01:31:12.834
That's the whole job.
Right there.

01:31:15.333 --> 01:31:16.834
No, you're a natural.

01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:20.750
I can see right into
the stadium.

01:31:20.834 --> 01:31:22.792
That's it.
You got it, you got it. Look!

01:31:22.875 --> 01:31:25.291
- Come on.
- You gotta get higher.

01:31:28.375 --> 01:31:31.709
(humming Ride of the Valkyries)

01:31:36.375 --> 01:31:38.667
(humming together)

01:31:52.542 --> 01:31:56.291
(police siren beeping)
- Uh-oh!

01:32:00.375 --> 01:32:02.000
Hold it steady.
- How you doing?

01:32:02.083 --> 01:32:04.250
Just making a quick phone call.
- Come on, come on. Faster.

01:32:04.333 --> 01:32:06.750
(Ride of the Valkyries playing)

01:32:10.625 --> 01:32:12.250
Hold it steady.

01:32:12.333 --> 01:32:14.333
- Quick, behind
the serial killer van.

01:32:14.417 --> 01:32:15.875
- Hold it steady.

01:32:18.542 --> 01:32:20.250
- We're losing it,
we're losing it.

01:32:20.333 --> 01:32:21.750
- Slow and steady. I can't see.
- You got it.

01:32:21.834 --> 01:32:25.333
- Just need a little more.
(police siren beeping)

01:32:25.417 --> 01:32:27.208
- Nice and tight.

01:32:27.291 --> 01:32:29.458
(police officer):
Drop your weapon!
- Good evening, officer.

01:32:29.542 --> 01:32:32.500
Just... not a weapon.
- Drop whatever is in your hand!

01:32:32.583 --> 01:32:34.458
- Just a little more time.

01:32:34.542 --> 01:32:37.834
- Gonna get down very slowly.
- I'm not gonna ask you again.

01:32:37.917 --> 01:32:39.875
- Putting it down.

01:32:40.417 --> 01:32:41.667
(whispering): Got it.

01:32:44.875 --> 01:32:47.375
(suspenseful music)

01:32:51.041 --> 01:32:53.917
(crashing)

01:32:56.500 --> 01:32:57.375
- Got it.

01:32:57.458 --> 01:32:59.709
Rest in peace, asshole.

01:33:02.458 --> 01:33:04.375
- Hands on the van!

01:33:11.041 --> 01:33:14.333
- And I tell you, if we weren't
a couple of white guys,

01:33:14.417 --> 01:33:16.667
we would've been tased,
beaten and pepper-sprayed.

01:33:16.750 --> 01:33:20.083
It's nice to know being
a tax-paying citizen is still
good for some in this country.

01:33:20.166 --> 01:33:22.250
- Okay. Here we go.

01:33:23.375 --> 01:33:25.959
- Even though I lost a friend,
I feel like I gained...

01:33:27.083 --> 01:33:28.959
his hot ex-wife.

01:33:29.041 --> 01:33:30.625
To leave a woman that's so...

01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:33.291
- Don't be gross.
Please don't be gross.

01:33:33.375 --> 01:33:34.959
- ...vital.

01:33:35.959 --> 01:33:39.417
Juicy. I mean,
which at her age... come on.

01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:42.625
- I understand. The more
that I ask you to stop,
the more you keep going.

01:33:43.834 --> 01:33:46.542
Just like in my mom.
(chuckling)

01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:51.667
- What?
- For my grandson.

01:33:53.458 --> 01:33:57.375
Your father gave this to me
on our first date.

01:33:57.458 --> 01:34:00.041
- That's really... sweet.

01:34:00.125 --> 01:34:02.583
- He had his moments.

01:34:02.667 --> 01:34:04.750
- Okay, well,
if you'll excuse me.

01:34:04.834 --> 01:34:05.709
Your mom's coffee goes
through me

01:34:05.792 --> 01:34:08.417
like a welfare mom
through food stamps.

01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:09.792
(phone chiming)
- Oh.

01:34:11.125 --> 01:34:12.125
Oh, that's my Uber. Okay.

01:34:12.208 --> 01:34:14.792
Gotta go.

01:34:15.458 --> 01:34:17.917
So I guess I'll see you
when I get back here.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.625
- Oh.

01:34:19.709 --> 01:34:21.625
I thought you said I could
come visit you next month.

01:34:21.709 --> 01:34:22.375
- What about the...

01:34:22.458 --> 01:34:25.750
the office
and the birthdays?

01:34:25.834 --> 01:34:28.000
- There's more to life
than just work.

01:34:30.458 --> 01:34:33.542
- I would like that.
Bring Jeff if you'd like.

01:34:33.625 --> 01:34:35.041
- Oh, don't jump ahead.

01:34:35.125 --> 01:34:36.208
We're just friends.

01:34:36.291 --> 01:34:39.583
I mean... with the benefit.
Is that how you say it?

01:34:39.667 --> 01:34:42.625
- That is how you say it, yes.

01:34:42.709 --> 01:34:45.041
- He certainly has some
interesting views.

01:34:45.125 --> 01:34:47.166
- Mmm... yeah, you could...

01:34:47.250 --> 01:34:49.792
you could help him out.

01:34:49.875 --> 01:34:52.041
I always said
you needed a hobby.

01:34:52.125 --> 01:34:53.834
- It's kind of nice to be liked.

01:34:53.917 --> 01:34:57.709
It's a good reason
to get up in the morning.

01:34:58.625 --> 01:34:59.875
- Yeah.

01:35:01.959 --> 01:35:03.333
(sighing)
- Go.

01:35:03.417 --> 01:35:04.500
- Okay.

01:35:04.583 --> 01:35:07.417
Uh, hey, Jeff!
I gotta get going.

01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:08.917
(Jeff): Yeah.
I'd come and say goodbye,

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.959
but I'm dealing with a real
Cancun omelette in here.

01:35:12.041 --> 01:35:13.709
- Okay.

01:35:15.917 --> 01:35:17.542
(snoring)

01:35:25.667 --> 01:35:28.917
(baby cooing)
(Ken, on baby monitor):
It's okay. It's okay.

01:35:29.917 --> 01:35:32.542
I'm gonna read you
a little story here.

01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:38.500
Fully equipped
2,000 square-foot

01:35:38.583 --> 01:35:40.959
with incidental liquor.

01:35:41.041 --> 01:35:44.458
Sidewalk cafe patio.

01:35:44.542 --> 01:35:46.792
Hear that?

01:35:46.875 --> 01:35:48.792
Package good.

01:35:48.875 --> 01:35:50.625
Looks good.

01:35:50.709 --> 01:35:54.792
Tobacco license.
No smoking for you.

01:35:54.875 --> 01:35:56.125
(baby cooing)

01:35:56.208 --> 01:35:59.834
This one is 1,100 square-foot

01:35:59.917 --> 01:36:04.583
with an 800-square-foot
basement.

01:36:04.667 --> 01:36:08.500
C-3 zoned.

01:36:08.583 --> 01:36:10.583
Hot location.

01:36:10.667 --> 01:36:12.667
- Hot location?

01:36:12.750 --> 01:36:15.583
You know, that was my band's
name in high school.

01:36:17.250 --> 01:36:18.625
Oh, my God.

01:36:18.709 --> 01:36:22.333
Is that a smile? Did it hurt?

01:36:22.417 --> 01:36:25.792
- No. But this might.

01:36:26.667 --> 01:36:28.750
What would you say

01:36:28.834 --> 01:36:32.000
if I told you
that I quit my job?

01:36:33.250 --> 01:36:36.041
- I'd say,

01:36:36.125 --> 01:36:37.875
do you really think
the fact that what's-his-name's

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.375
almost out is gonna keep me
from yelling at you?

01:36:41.458 --> 01:36:43.041
- That was the plan.

01:36:47.917 --> 01:36:49.750
- Wake me up
when you come to bed.

01:36:49.834 --> 01:36:53.000
- You wanna talk about it
tonight?

01:36:53.333 --> 01:36:55.792
- No.

01:36:55.875 --> 01:36:58.000
I don't want to talk tonight.

01:36:59.291 --> 01:37:02.166
(soft music)

01:37:04.166 --> 01:37:05.542
- Oh.

01:37:06.917 --> 01:37:09.583
Okay. One more story.

01:37:11.709 --> 01:37:13.208
Once upon a time...

01:37:13.291 --> 01:37:16.000
there was...

01:37:17.458 --> 01:37:19.041
this golfer.

01:37:19.125 --> 01:37:23.083
And one day, he came home late
from the golf course.

01:37:23.166 --> 01:37:24.583
