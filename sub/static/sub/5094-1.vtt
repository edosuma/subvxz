WEBVTT

00:11.209 --> 00:13.210
You Reagan?

00:13.212 --> 00:15.079
Yeah.
Eddie Janko.

00:15.081 --> 00:18.549
Sarge says we're, uh...
we're riding together.

00:20.151 --> 00:21.418
Something wrong?

00:21.420 --> 00:23.354
No, um, I was expecting a...

00:23.356 --> 00:25.055
Fat, sweaty Hungarian guy?

00:25.057 --> 00:26.090
(laughs)

00:26.092 --> 00:27.324
Sorry to burst your bubble.

00:27.326 --> 00:28.993
Uh, no offense.

00:28.995 --> 00:32.262
Oh, no, trust me,
it's really hard to offend me.

00:32.265 --> 00:34.265
My real name's Edit,
after my grandmother,

00:34.267 --> 00:37.401
but Eddie's just
easier all around.

00:37.403 --> 00:40.437
Okay, um, who was
your last partner?

00:40.439 --> 00:43.974
Actually, I just graduated
from the academy last week.

00:46.511 --> 00:48.045
Oh, seriously.

00:48.047 --> 00:49.413
You're my first, Reagan.

00:49.415 --> 00:50.648
Be gentle.

00:50.650 --> 00:52.349
I just meant,
all of my other partners

00:52.351 --> 00:54.671
have had at least as much time
on the job as me.

00:54.672 --> 00:56.155
Oh.

00:56.157 --> 00:58.157
Should I come back
in a few years?

00:58.159 --> 01:00.043
I'll let you know
after our tour.

01:00.045 --> 01:02.428
DISPATCH (over radio): All
units, 10-13 from the officer.

01:02.430 --> 01:03.880
Shots fired, corner of

01:03.882 --> 01:06.132
three-two and nine.
Units responding.

01:06.134 --> 01:08.284
That's us. So much
for starting slow. Hey!

01:08.286 --> 01:09.502
Do you mind if I drive?

01:09.504 --> 01:10.887
I don't think...

Hey, hey, whoa!

01:15.627 --> 01:17.160

01:23.017 --> 01:25.818

as tires screech)

01:26.603 --> 01:28.087
Hey, what have you got?

01:28.089 --> 01:29.789
Responding
to a 10-30 in progress.

01:29.791 --> 01:31.824
That jewelry store, two perps.

01:31.826 --> 01:33.309
We took shots
when we came through the door.

01:33.311 --> 01:34.627
One of them flew out the back.

01:34.629 --> 01:35.712
I chased him, he got away.

01:35.714 --> 01:37.029
My partner went after
the other guy.

01:37.031 --> 01:38.665

01:48.976 --> 01:50.426

01:50.428 --> 01:51.678
We got a body.

01:51.680 --> 01:54.597
Hey... hey...

01:54.599 --> 01:55.848
(moaning)

01:55.850 --> 01:57.684
Collins...

01:57.686 --> 01:58.851
(gasping)

01:58.853 --> 02:01.404
Where are you hit?
(crying)

02:01.406 --> 02:03.156
Put pressure on it!
Put pressure on it!

02:03.158 --> 02:05.291
Lori, Lori,
where'd he go?

02:05.293 --> 02:07.226
(gasping):
He took off... through the park.

02:07.228 --> 02:09.946
Hang in there, Collins.
You're gonna be all right.

02:09.948 --> 02:11.164
JANKO: We have an officer shot.
Location: inside Lenox Avenue.

02:11.166 --> 02:13.282
Stay here.
Stay with her.

02:13.284 --> 02:15.067
Come on, come on!
Get her in!

02:17.371 --> 02:20.089
(Collins gasping rapidly)

02:23.877 --> 02:26.879
(Collins gasping)

02:26.881 --> 02:28.798
DISPATCH (over radio):
All units, 10-13.

02:28.800 --> 02:32.268
We have a confirmed officer shot
in Lenox Avenue park,

02:32.270 --> 02:34.086
vicinity of park house.

02:34.088 --> 02:35.855
Units respond.

02:35.857 --> 02:38.024
(sirens wailing)

02:44.198 --> 02:47.066
Officers Reagan and Janko
were first to respond.

02:47.068 --> 02:50.269
Officer Collins
is in surgery now.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.038
How bad?

02:52.040 --> 02:54.273
Took one to the
stomach under her vest.

02:54.275 --> 02:55.575
Lost a lot of blood.

02:55.577 --> 02:56.893
Commissioner.

02:56.895 --> 02:58.544
How's my officer?

02:58.546 --> 03:01.781
We did everything we could,
but there was too much damage.

03:01.783 --> 03:03.616
She died a few minutes ago.

03:03.618 --> 03:06.686
I'm sorry, Frank.

03:10.307 --> 03:12.558
Her husband's
in the chapel.

03:14.144 --> 03:15.511
I'll talk to him.

03:15.513 --> 03:17.597
With their
five-year-old daughter.

03:17.599 --> 03:20.466
Andrew and Katie.

03:23.103 --> 03:25.271
(sighs)

03:36.500 --> 03:38.701
We lost her.

03:44.157 --> 03:46.175
Sir, this is my partner.

03:46.177 --> 03:48.711
Officer Janko, sir.

03:48.713 --> 03:50.847
You going back to the scene?

03:50.849 --> 03:53.299
As soon as we talk
to the detectives.

03:53.301 --> 03:55.468
(sighs)

03:57.221 --> 03:59.839
We need to get
this son of a bitch.

Keep hearing the same name:
Angelo Reid.

04:54.527 --> 04:56.844
Angelo Reid-- can anyone
place him at the scene?

04:56.846 --> 04:57.995
No, but word is,

04:57.997 --> 05:00.831
he just finished
his ten upstate-- armed robbery.

05:00.833 --> 05:02.516
You get anything
on the other perp?

05:02.518 --> 05:04.619
Just Officer Salazar's
description.

05:04.621 --> 05:06.420
Stay on it, okay?

05:06.422 --> 05:07.922
You got it.

05:08.690 --> 05:10.758
WOMAN:
Detective Reagan?

05:14.730 --> 05:16.614
This is Miss Caruso.

05:16.616 --> 05:17.398
How are you?

05:17.400 --> 05:18.599
WOMAN:
Lives next

05:18.601 --> 05:19.867
to the jewelry store.

05:19.869 --> 05:21.986
Says she saw a man with a gun
running from the park.

05:21.988 --> 05:24.839
Ma'am, do you think if, um,
we showed you some photographs,

05:24.841 --> 05:26.724
you might be able
to identify this man?

05:26.726 --> 05:29.126
Well, it was dark,
but I can try.

05:29.128 --> 05:30.528
All right, why don't you put her
in a radio car,

05:30.530 --> 05:31.913
all right?
Bring her to our office.

05:31.915 --> 05:33.497
Come with me, ma'am.

05:39.454 --> 05:42.673
How much information you
want released to the press?

05:42.675 --> 05:44.425
Stick to the basics.

05:44.427 --> 05:46.410
Chief Arbogast is here.

05:46.412 --> 05:48.312
Dino.

05:48.314 --> 05:51.015
Hell of a week
to start a new job.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.299
Where are we, Dino?

05:52.301 --> 05:54.035
Working on an idea
of the shooter,

05:54.037 --> 05:55.419
nothing yet on the second perp.

05:55.421 --> 05:57.905
Got uniforms
at the house.

05:57.907 --> 05:59.857
Family's coming up from Philly.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.609
I knew this girl, Frank.

06:03.111 --> 06:06.697
I was at little Katie's
christening.

06:10.002 --> 06:11.652
Whatever it takes.

06:19.795 --> 06:22.647
It's hard to say for sure.

06:22.649 --> 06:25.299
It-it happened so fast.

06:27.302 --> 06:28.803
Okay.

06:31.139 --> 06:33.641
(sighs) I don't think she's
gonna make this guy, Danny.

06:33.643 --> 06:36.227
This guy Angelo-- he's got
a rap sheet a mile long.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.396
Surveillance video puts him
right outside the jewelry store

06:38.398 --> 06:39.914
a few hours before
the robbery.

06:39.916 --> 06:41.849
We need more than that
to make the collar.

06:41.851 --> 06:43.484
(sighs)
All right.

06:48.189 --> 06:49.407
(sighs)

06:49.409 --> 06:51.509
How you doing, Mrs. Caruso?

06:51.511 --> 06:52.960
Oh, hi.

06:52.962 --> 06:54.145
Can I get you some coffee?

06:54.147 --> 06:56.464
Nah. Just wish I could help.

06:56.466 --> 06:58.416
Yeah, me, too. So...

06:58.418 --> 07:00.384
why don't we take another
look at this, okay?

07:00.386 --> 07:01.552
Oh, okay.

07:01.554 --> 07:04.422
Now, you said that the guy
had short hair, right?

07:04.424 --> 07:05.673
Yes.
Okay.

07:05.675 --> 07:07.558
Well, that eliminates
those three.

07:07.560 --> 07:09.510
But he wasn't bald, right?
Correct.

07:09.512 --> 07:12.680
Okay, now, that
eliminates those two.

07:12.682 --> 07:16.383
Leaving...
only this one man.

07:16.385 --> 07:19.386
Is that the man that
you saw, Mrs. Caruso?

07:20.956 --> 07:24.525
I suppose it could be him.

07:26.728 --> 07:28.562
Okay, I need to
know for sure.

07:28.564 --> 07:31.065
I want you to take a
closer look, all right?

07:31.067 --> 07:33.901
It could be him,
couldn't it?

07:36.922 --> 07:38.906
That's him.

07:38.908 --> 07:41.092
Good. Just sign this.

07:41.094 --> 07:43.844
I'll have an officer
escort you out. Officer?

07:43.846 --> 07:45.429
CARUSO: Thank you.
DANNY: Thank you.

07:45.431 --> 07:47.465
Make sure she signs that.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.799
Got it.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.401
Kind of drew her
a diagram there.

07:50.403 --> 07:52.303
What do you want me to do?
(phone ringing)

07:52.305 --> 07:54.254
Someone takes out a cop,
all bets are off.

07:54.256 --> 07:56.807
Yeah. Got it.

07:56.809 --> 07:58.943
Transit cop spotted a guy
fitting Reid's description

07:58.945 --> 08:00.361
in Grand Central.

08:00.363 --> 08:03.314
Good.
Let's go catch a train.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.635
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

08:17.796 --> 08:20.397
BAEZ (over radio): Approaching
the main concourse now.

08:32.460 --> 08:34.461
You got eyes on him, partner?

08:34.462 --> 08:36.296
Not yet.

08:38.650 --> 08:40.900
(over radio):
Hang on.

08:40.903 --> 08:42.236
I got him.

08:42.238 --> 08:44.421
He's using the lady
with the stroller as a cover.

08:46.641 --> 08:48.642
Fits his MO.

08:49.978 --> 08:51.412
I'm going in.

08:52.531 --> 08:54.081
Police!

08:57.335 --> 08:59.170
(Reid grunts, woman screams)

09:01.790 --> 09:03.824
(grunting)

09:05.827 --> 09:07.294
Move!

09:12.284 --> 09:15.452
(Reid grunts)
You taking a trip, Angelo? Huh?

09:15.454 --> 09:16.770
Was I jaywalking again, Officer?

09:16.772 --> 09:18.022
Making jokes now, huh?

09:18.024 --> 09:19.840
I ain't kill no lady cop.

09:19.842 --> 09:21.192
Lady cop?

09:21.194 --> 09:24.361
Who said anything about
a lady cop, tough guy?

09:24.363 --> 09:25.846
I got ears.
You got nothing on me.

09:25.848 --> 09:27.448
I got an eyewitness saw you

09:27.450 --> 09:28.866
walking out of that park
last night.

09:28.868 --> 09:30.251
(gasping) Let me tell you
something, buddy.

09:30.253 --> 09:32.153
You're gonna burn in Hell
for this one.

09:37.525 --> 09:40.327
It's okay; take your time,
Mrs. Caruso.

09:44.332 --> 09:46.967
Exactly how old
is this witness?

09:48.253 --> 09:49.637
DANNY:
You see anyone you recognize,

09:49.639 --> 09:51.305
just tell me the number
and let me know

09:51.307 --> 09:53.207
where you recognize
him from, okay?

09:53.209 --> 09:55.960
CARUSO:
I... I-I think

09:55.962 --> 09:57.178
it might be...

10:00.932 --> 10:03.067
...number three?

10:03.069 --> 10:05.102
Number three.

10:05.104 --> 10:06.120
Are you certain, ma'am?

10:06.122 --> 10:08.372
Well, he looks different
from his picture,

10:08.374 --> 10:10.324
but I'm pretty sure
that's him.

10:10.326 --> 10:12.660
There you have it.

10:12.662 --> 10:13.727
Number three.

10:13.729 --> 10:15.496
All right.

10:15.498 --> 10:17.114
Clear out
the lineup, please,

10:17.116 --> 10:18.616
and escort Mrs. Caruso over

10:18.618 --> 10:20.751
to Sergeant Gormley's office
for me, all right?

10:20.753 --> 10:22.086
Thank you.

10:22.088 --> 10:23.571
Thank you.

10:23.573 --> 10:25.405
Good job.
Thanks.

10:28.510 --> 10:30.211
That's your eyewitness?

10:30.213 --> 10:31.912
What?

10:31.914 --> 10:33.130
She picked the right guy.

10:33.132 --> 10:35.299
"I'm pretty sure that's him"?

10:35.301 --> 10:37.935
If I put her on the stand,

10:37.937 --> 10:39.770
Reid's attorney is going
to eat her for lunch.

10:39.772 --> 10:42.756
Well, I'm sure your office
will have her prepped.

10:42.758 --> 10:44.508
What else do you have?

10:44.510 --> 10:47.278
We got Reid hanging
around the jewelry store

10:47.280 --> 10:49.230
a few hours
before it was robbed.

10:49.232 --> 10:50.597
He lives in the neighborhood.

10:50.599 --> 10:52.733
We need something solid
to charge this guy.

10:52.735 --> 10:55.769
A weapon, possession of
stolen goods, something.

10:55.771 --> 10:58.939
Well, the MO of the heist
fits two of Reid's

10:58.941 --> 11:01.575
previous burglaries, all right?

11:01.577 --> 11:02.993
(stammers) Hm...

11:02.995 --> 11:04.878
"Crowbar on the lock.

11:04.880 --> 11:06.630
Cut the alarm."

11:06.632 --> 11:08.682
Not exactly a signature, Danny.

11:08.684 --> 11:11.285
Come on, this guy knew
why we were picking him up.

11:11.287 --> 11:13.304
Doesn't qualify as confession.

11:13.306 --> 11:14.672
We don't need a confession.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.591
Mrs. Caruso picked this guy
out of a photo array!

11:17.593 --> 11:18.842
Which is not admissible
in court.

11:18.844 --> 11:19.960
Not to mention...

11:19.962 --> 11:21.461
You don't have
to mention anything!

11:21.463 --> 11:22.796
He killed a cop!

11:22.798 --> 11:26.517
I know that, which is why
I pulled rank to get this case.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.352
I want him
as badly as you do.

11:28.354 --> 11:31.405
But I cannot put that lineup
in front of a judge!

11:34.776 --> 11:37.945
You cannot or you will not?

11:39.281 --> 11:41.048
Excuse me?

11:41.050 --> 11:42.416
This guy's a cop killer,
and you're worried

11:42.418 --> 11:43.667
about your batting average?

11:43.669 --> 11:45.669
You seriously think
that I am worried

11:45.671 --> 11:47.338
about a loss on my record?

11:47.340 --> 11:48.505
Reid is our guy.

11:48.507 --> 11:51.041
You toss that lineup
and I gotta cut him loose!

11:51.043 --> 11:53.127
Then give me something
I can use,

11:53.129 --> 11:55.162
and I will charge him.

11:55.164 --> 11:57.614
Until then, he is free to go.

12:00.652 --> 12:02.636
(door opens)

12:02.638 --> 12:04.438
(sighs heavily)

12:14.231 --> 12:16.783
I can't believe the son of
a bitch is still on the street.

12:16.785 --> 12:18.785
Reid's probably on his way
out of town right now.

12:18.787 --> 12:20.987
I doubt it. The moron
thinks he got away with it.

12:20.989 --> 12:23.239
Maybe he did.
That's not gonna happen.

12:23.241 --> 12:25.375
We got anything
on the second perp?

12:25.377 --> 12:27.577
Maybe we find this guy,
he rolls over on Reid,

12:27.579 --> 12:29.879
we can all sleep at night.
But the problem is,

12:29.881 --> 12:31.848
we got nothing;
he's a ghost.

12:31.850 --> 12:34.934
Hey, there's no such
thing as ghosts.

12:34.936 --> 12:36.353
Let's see who
he's hanging out with.

12:36.355 --> 12:37.937
All right.

12:37.939 --> 12:40.940
According to his sheet,
Reid pulled burglaries

12:40.942 --> 12:42.592
with four other lowlifes:

12:42.594 --> 12:44.027
Brandon Lefko...

12:45.413 --> 12:48.598
Doing 12 years upstate.

12:48.600 --> 12:49.649
Great.

12:49.651 --> 12:53.102
Manuel Hernandez, DOB: 12/16/81.

12:53.104 --> 12:54.070
(tapping keyboard)

12:54.072 --> 12:57.490
Deported to
the Dominican Republic.

12:57.492 --> 12:59.743
Ed Garvey.

12:59.745 --> 13:01.411
(tapping keyboard)

13:03.347 --> 13:05.715
OD'd in Jersey last year.

13:05.717 --> 13:07.217
Reid's not exactly hanging out

13:07.219 --> 13:09.302
with the National
Honor Society here.

13:09.304 --> 13:10.970
Which leaves Joey Fabrizio.

13:10.972 --> 13:12.672
Let me guess.

13:16.227 --> 13:17.594
On probation.

13:17.596 --> 13:19.479
We got two felonies on him,

13:19.481 --> 13:21.347
but he's out on the street.

13:21.349 --> 13:23.650
Let's get a warrant card
out on him.

13:23.652 --> 13:25.101
This guy's hiding
in a hole somewhere.

13:25.103 --> 13:28.154
We're gonna dig him out.

13:31.642 --> 13:34.494
You may be sorry, Tom, but I've
got an officer in the morgue

13:34.496 --> 13:36.162
and a cop killer on the street.

13:36.164 --> 13:38.364
I'll be expecting your call.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.217
District Attorney.

13:41.219 --> 13:43.570
Wasn't his call
to let Reid walk.

13:43.572 --> 13:44.904
Whose call was it?

13:44.906 --> 13:47.707
Deputy Bureau Chief,
in the Trial Division.

13:47.709 --> 13:50.193
GARRETT: Please tell me
that Deputy Bureau Chief

13:50.195 --> 13:52.495
doesn't share
the PC's last name.

13:52.497 --> 13:54.347
Wish I could.

13:54.349 --> 13:56.800
GARRETT: We got another
problem, Frank.

13:56.802 --> 13:58.101
Angelo Reid called the <i>Post.</i>

13:58.103 --> 13:59.936
Says he's getting
threatening phone calls,

13:59.938 --> 14:01.888
and someone tossed a brick
through his window.

14:01.890 --> 14:03.223
Claims police harassment.

14:03.225 --> 14:05.108
There's zero proof
it was cops.

14:05.110 --> 14:06.359
Still doesn't look right.

14:06.361 --> 14:07.710
GARRETT:
And if Reid happens

14:07.712 --> 14:09.896
to end up dead
at the hands of cops,

14:09.898 --> 14:11.281
all hell's gonna break loose.

14:11.283 --> 14:13.366
Put a radio car on Reid's house.

14:13.368 --> 14:17.020
Well, we are gonna give
this skel protection?

14:17.022 --> 14:18.721
If anything happens,
it'll look like

14:18.723 --> 14:20.707
we're behind it
or let it happen.

14:20.709 --> 14:22.492
The rank and file
are gonna go nuts.

14:22.494 --> 14:24.410
Put a car on Reid.

14:26.464 --> 14:27.580
You're the boss.

14:30.384 --> 14:32.585
What are you gonna
do about Erin?

14:32.587 --> 14:35.755
Give me a minute.

14:39.977 --> 14:42.145
(sighs)

14:43.397 --> 14:46.048
(phone ringing)

14:48.319 --> 14:50.553
How are you holding up?

14:50.555 --> 14:54.824
I'm gonna ask you something,
and you can say "no."

14:54.826 --> 14:55.859
Okay.

14:55.861 --> 14:58.077
I'm putting a car
on Angelo Reid.

14:58.079 --> 14:59.496
There have been threats.

14:59.498 --> 15:02.248
I want to ask Renzulli
to put you on the detail.

15:02.250 --> 15:03.533
No one will know.

15:03.535 --> 15:05.502
I thought
I was just another cop.

15:05.504 --> 15:07.053
You are.

15:07.055 --> 15:08.338
You're also a lawyer,

15:08.340 --> 15:11.741
and you will understand the why
of this more than most.

15:13.294 --> 15:16.412
Do what you have to do,
Commissioner.

15:17.247 --> 15:18.915
(phone beeps off
as Frank sighs)

15:20.751 --> 15:22.101
Have you lost your mind?

15:22.103 --> 15:23.553
There was no
compelling reason

15:23.555 --> 15:25.221
to charge Angelo Reid.

15:25.223 --> 15:28.491
Except for the fact that
he killed a police officer.

15:28.493 --> 15:31.060
The sole eyewitness
could barely I.D. the guy.

15:31.062 --> 15:32.862
You would never
have proceeded.

15:32.864 --> 15:34.814
Don't be so sure.

15:34.816 --> 15:36.699
Now the cops are certain
they've got the right guy.

15:36.701 --> 15:38.267
Do you disagree?

15:38.269 --> 15:40.236
No. He's most
likely the shooter.

15:40.238 --> 15:42.288
And yet, you still
let him go.

15:42.290 --> 15:44.574
We decline
to charge suspects every day.

15:44.576 --> 15:47.744
A lot of them are guilty,
but you still need evidence.

15:47.746 --> 15:51.047
There are rules
in situations like this.

15:51.049 --> 15:52.215
I know there are rules,

15:52.217 --> 15:54.717
but there has to be
reasonable limits.

15:54.719 --> 15:55.919
Probable cause just doesn't

15:55.921 --> 15:58.221
disappear because
a cop is shot.

15:58.223 --> 16:00.456
Maybe not, but it damn well
takes a backseat

16:00.458 --> 16:02.625
when a member of the justice
system is the victim.

16:02.627 --> 16:04.844
Amanda...
The effectiveness

16:04.846 --> 16:08.147
of this office depends on
its relationship with the NYPD.

16:08.149 --> 16:10.466
They set 'em up,
we knock 'em down,

16:10.468 --> 16:12.235
and the bad guys land in jail.

16:12.237 --> 16:15.772
I know how important
the relationship is.

16:15.774 --> 16:18.641
It is a lot more than that.

16:20.411 --> 16:24.614
Are you ordering me
to charge Angelo Reid,

16:24.616 --> 16:27.116
despite the clear
lack of evidence?

16:27.118 --> 16:29.168
Oh, no... you don't
get off that easily.

16:29.170 --> 16:31.170
This one is all yours.

16:32.823 --> 16:33.957
You fix this.

16:42.216 --> 16:43.583
EDDIE:
<i>I can't believe</i>

16:43.585 --> 16:46.235
we're protecting
this piece of garbage.

16:46.237 --> 16:48.371
Yeah, someone had
to get the assignment.

16:48.373 --> 16:50.440
At least we pulled
night shift...

16:50.442 --> 16:51.991
you know, it should
be pretty quiet.

16:51.993 --> 16:54.110
It doesn't bother you,
sitting on this guy's house?

16:54.112 --> 16:55.862
Yeah, I wish Reid was
rotting in a cell.

16:55.864 --> 16:57.780
At least we can
keep an eye on him,

16:57.782 --> 16:59.015
make sure he
doesn't skip town.

16:59.017 --> 17:01.651
Do you think it was cops who
called in those threats?

17:01.653 --> 17:02.702
Could be.

17:02.704 --> 17:04.353
Collins had a lot of
friends on the job.

17:04.355 --> 17:06.623
They deserve a shot at him.

17:06.625 --> 17:07.773
An eye for an eye...

17:07.776 --> 17:09.242
...leaves the whole
world blind.

17:09.243 --> 17:10.292
Last time I checked,

17:10.295 --> 17:11.678
Gandhi wasn't a cop.

17:11.680 --> 17:14.414
(laughs)

17:14.415 --> 17:16.449
You're not the only one
that went to school, Reagan.

17:16.451 --> 17:18.300
(wry laugh)

17:19.837 --> 17:21.337
Here we go.

17:24.340 --> 17:25.374
What do you want?

17:25.376 --> 17:27.376
Uh, good evening,
Officers.

17:27.377 --> 17:30.763
I just want to tell you guys
how safe I feel,

17:30.765 --> 17:32.315
knowing you're out here.

17:32.317 --> 17:33.599
Watch your mouth.

17:33.601 --> 17:35.318
Yeah, whatever, chief.

17:35.320 --> 17:38.187
Thing is... I really
need some cigarettes.

17:38.189 --> 17:40.623
Well, that sounds like
a personal problem.

17:40.625 --> 17:43.993
There's a drugstore
right on the corner.

17:43.995 --> 17:46.162
I know you got my back.

17:48.332 --> 17:49.732
Tell me we're not
giving this guy

17:49.734 --> 17:51.467
an armed escort to buy
a pack of smokes.

17:51.469 --> 17:52.785
That's the assignment.

17:52.787 --> 17:53.920
Look on the bright side.

17:53.922 --> 17:55.538
Maybe he'll trip
and break his neck.

17:57.124 --> 17:59.659
DANNY:
<i>Okay, if you get anything</i>

17:59.661 --> 18:01.928
on his whereabouts,
would you give me a call?

18:03.047 --> 18:05.214
Yeah, I'd appreciate it.
Thanks.

18:07.968 --> 18:10.536
I got nothing from
Fabrizio's parole officer.

18:10.538 --> 18:12.038
You check with his family?

18:12.040 --> 18:13.806
I spoke to a cousin
in Hell's Kitchen.

18:13.808 --> 18:15.308
Hasn't seen Fabrizio
in four years.

18:15.310 --> 18:16.425
(Danny sighs)

18:16.427 --> 18:18.111
We're chasing our
tails here, partner.

18:18.113 --> 18:20.363
(sighs) We gotta
face facts, Danny.

18:20.365 --> 18:21.764
This guy may
have blown town.

18:21.766 --> 18:22.949
Maybe.

18:24.735 --> 18:27.036
Or maybe not.

18:27.038 --> 18:29.489
Take a look at that.

18:29.491 --> 18:31.457
MARIA:
Fabrizio was busted

18:31.459 --> 18:33.409
for shooting up
in prison. So?

18:33.411 --> 18:34.827
Yeah, but he was popped twice

18:34.829 --> 18:36.963
for scoring heroin
in-between felonies.

18:36.965 --> 18:39.448
So this guy's
a needle head.

18:39.450 --> 18:40.550
If he's got a habit,

18:40.552 --> 18:41.718
he's got to have
a dealer, right?

18:41.720 --> 18:43.636
Which means he's
sticking close to home

18:43.638 --> 18:45.304
in order to score
the drugs that he needs.

18:45.306 --> 18:46.723
Exactly.

18:46.725 --> 18:47.974
Says here
he was collared

18:47.976 --> 18:51.094
scoring off a local dealer
named Trevor Powell.

18:51.096 --> 18:52.562
You don't say.

18:52.564 --> 18:54.697
Let's go chat with Trevor.

19:01.238 --> 19:03.356
Trevor Powell.

19:05.142 --> 19:07.026
Got a few questions
for you, tough guy.

19:07.028 --> 19:08.694
I ain't holding nothing, okay?

19:08.696 --> 19:09.812
Shut up.

19:10.313 --> 19:11.313
(grunts)

19:11.315 --> 19:12.498
A New York City cop
was killed last night.

19:12.500 --> 19:13.482
That has my partner

19:13.484 --> 19:15.134
and I in
a pretty bad mood.

19:15.136 --> 19:16.836
So we'd appreciate
your cooperation.

19:16.838 --> 19:17.920
Give him a toss.

19:17.922 --> 19:19.622
We're looking for Joey Fabrizio.

19:19.624 --> 19:20.957
Who?
Joey Fabrizio.

19:20.959 --> 19:21.908
You got collared

19:21.910 --> 19:23.325
selling drugs to the guy.

19:23.327 --> 19:25.428
It doesn't ring a bell.

19:26.496 --> 19:29.899
But you're holding
something, hmm?

19:31.135 --> 19:32.385
What's this?

19:33.637 --> 19:35.054
Son of a bitch.

19:35.056 --> 19:36.889
Would you
look at that?

19:36.891 --> 19:39.692
Funny, but Joey Fabrizio's
wanted in connection

19:39.694 --> 19:41.477
for a jewelry store robbery.

19:41.479 --> 19:42.695
Stuff similar to this.

19:42.697 --> 19:44.030
How much heroin
does a rock

19:44.032 --> 19:45.448
like that buy you, Trevor?

19:45.450 --> 19:48.034
I don't know where they...
Hey!

19:48.036 --> 19:49.452
Shut your mouth.

19:49.454 --> 19:50.837
I'm gonna give
you two choices:

19:50.839 --> 19:52.371
you're gonna give me
an address where

19:52.373 --> 19:54.190
I could find Joey,
or I'm gonna stick this

19:54.192 --> 19:55.832
down your lying throat,
you understand me?

19:58.361 --> 19:59.361
Good.

19:59.363 --> 20:00.863
Start talking.

20:06.369 --> 20:08.187
I want this guy alive.

20:08.189 --> 20:10.723
Two, that way. Go.

20:18.765 --> 20:20.983
Two more. Come on, go.

20:35.565 --> 20:36.565
(rattling)

20:36.567 --> 20:37.566
Shh!

20:39.369 --> 20:42.171
Hey! Hold up!
He's on the run!

20:42.173 --> 20:44.406
(officers shouting)

20:44.408 --> 20:46.008
Hold it, Joey!

20:48.679 --> 20:50.847
OFFICER:
...somebody cover the windows!

20:54.101 --> 20:56.936
Subject exited
a window onto the alley.

21:00.891 --> 21:01.941
OFFICER:
Freeze!

21:01.943 --> 21:04.026
Put your hands in the air

21:04.028 --> 21:06.095
and drop to your knees.

21:07.364 --> 21:08.597
OFFICER:
On your knees!

21:08.599 --> 21:10.066
On your knees!

21:10.068 --> 21:11.200
You got nowhere to go, Joey.

21:12.619 --> 21:14.820
Got nowhere to go.

21:17.607 --> 21:19.792
Hey!

21:20.994 --> 21:22.879
I'm not dying in jail.

21:22.881 --> 21:24.964
You don't have to die at all.

21:24.966 --> 21:27.116
Just take it easy.
All right?

21:28.118 --> 21:29.385
Lower your weapons.

21:29.387 --> 21:31.787
Everyone, lower your weapons
right now!

21:32.973 --> 21:35.374
It's just me and you
here, all right?

21:35.376 --> 21:37.009
Okay?

21:37.011 --> 21:38.761
You cooperate here,
we can work something out.

21:38.763 --> 21:40.930
With a dead cop?

21:43.150 --> 21:44.667
It ain't happening.

21:44.669 --> 21:46.452
Let's talk.

21:46.454 --> 21:47.803
Joey...

21:47.805 --> 21:49.272
don't do that.

21:49.274 --> 21:51.473
Joey, we could
work something out.

21:51.475 --> 21:52.825
Do not put your hand
on that weapon.

21:52.827 --> 21:54.377
Joey!

21:54.379 --> 21:56.112
Do not put your hand
on that weapon!

21:56.997 --> 22:00.499
No! No! Hold your fire!

22:00.501 --> 22:01.650
Hold your fire!

22:05.622 --> 22:07.423
Hey, hey...

22:07.425 --> 22:08.874
you're not gonna make it.

22:09.760 --> 22:10.927
Look at me.

22:10.929 --> 22:13.045
You understand me?
You're gonna die.

22:13.047 --> 22:14.130
This is your last chance
to make

22:14.132 --> 22:15.214
something good
out of your useless life.

22:15.216 --> 22:16.549
You understand me?

22:18.719 --> 22:21.137
Tell me who was in
on that score with you.

22:21.139 --> 22:22.805
Joey...

22:22.807 --> 22:25.024
Joey! Tell me!

22:25.026 --> 22:27.860
Tell me! Joey!

22:33.317 --> 22:36.285
We just lost our best shot
at nailing Angelo Reid.

22:53.974 --> 22:56.275
(sighs)

23:01.197 --> 23:03.198
I thought that
Officer Collins' father gave

23:03.200 --> 23:05.000
a beautiful eulogy.

23:06.402 --> 23:07.903
You did good, too, Dad.

23:07.905 --> 23:11.023
I've had a lot of practice.

23:11.025 --> 23:12.541
Was a strong turnout.

23:12.543 --> 23:13.825
Yeah.

23:13.827 --> 23:16.211
I saw badges from
Rockland county and Westchester.

23:16.213 --> 23:18.764
My office has started
a fund for the girl.

23:20.450 --> 23:21.767
Good.

23:22.602 --> 23:24.636
SEAN: Grandpa?

23:24.638 --> 23:25.771
Did you know Officer Collins?

23:25.773 --> 23:27.189
No, I didn't.

23:27.191 --> 23:28.840
Then why did you go
to her funeral?

23:28.842 --> 23:32.778
For the same reason hundreds
of other guys in uniform went.

23:33.930 --> 23:35.747
Out of loyalty.

23:37.901 --> 23:41.353
Okay, obviously,
some of you are mad at me.

23:41.355 --> 23:43.521
Figured that out all by
yourself, did you?

23:45.058 --> 23:45.958
What's going on?

23:45.960 --> 23:47.559
Jack...

23:47.561 --> 23:49.694
Everyone's got a job to do,
and each one's different.

23:49.696 --> 23:52.080
Your dad is chasing someone

23:52.082 --> 23:54.082
that may have done
something really bad.

23:54.084 --> 23:55.968
DANNY (clears throat):
"May have."

23:55.970 --> 23:58.420
The guy's a stone
cold killer, Erin.

23:58.422 --> 24:00.389
Okay, unfortunately in my job
you can't just say it.

24:00.391 --> 24:02.891
You need to prove it.

24:02.893 --> 24:04.576
Are we talking about the guy
who killed Officer Collins?

24:04.578 --> 24:06.311
Yes.

24:06.313 --> 24:09.014
And it's a complicated issue.

24:09.016 --> 24:10.649
Guys, why don't you take
your plates and...?

24:10.651 --> 24:11.767
And go in the other room?

24:11.769 --> 24:12.834
There's a big shock.

24:12.836 --> 24:14.386
ERIN:
Okay, well...

24:14.388 --> 24:17.272
I think this is really a good
opportunity for them to learn

24:17.274 --> 24:18.890
about what a lawyer
can and cannot do.

24:18.892 --> 24:20.859
For instance,
a lawyer cannot charge

24:20.861 --> 24:23.078
someone man with a crime,
especially a murder,

24:23.080 --> 24:26.081
without sufficient evidence.

24:26.083 --> 24:27.716
I heard there's a witness.

24:27.718 --> 24:29.201
Who I.D.'d the shooter.

24:29.203 --> 24:30.936
So, what's the problem?

24:30.938 --> 24:32.754
It is highly unlikely
that the witness

24:32.756 --> 24:36.341
will hold up
on cross-examination.

24:36.343 --> 24:38.160
LINDA: So that guy who left
a five-year-old girl

24:38.162 --> 24:40.562
without a mother walks free?

24:40.564 --> 24:42.464
Not if the police
can establish

24:42.466 --> 24:45.100
probable cause
to make an arrest.

24:45.102 --> 24:46.885
And there it is.

24:46.887 --> 24:48.437
The classic DA line.

24:48.439 --> 24:49.771
Detective, could you please

24:49.773 --> 24:51.773
hand me this case
on a silver platter?

24:51.775 --> 24:52.891
That...

24:52.893 --> 24:54.042
Your sister never said that.

24:54.044 --> 24:56.061
Thank you.

24:56.063 --> 24:57.262
Look, I hear
what you're saying, Erin,

24:57.264 --> 24:58.363
but I'm guarding this guy
that you let go.

24:58.365 --> 25:01.266
And he's laughing in our faces.

25:01.268 --> 25:03.418
That's not Mom's fault.

25:03.420 --> 25:05.704
Look, I'm sorry, but I cannot
charge someone without proof.

25:05.706 --> 25:06.905
I took an oath.

25:06.907 --> 25:09.157
So did that officer
we buried today.

25:09.159 --> 25:11.710
Pop...
All the men at this table

25:11.712 --> 25:12.661
took an oath.

25:12.663 --> 25:14.129
To put their lives on the line

25:14.131 --> 25:15.797
to protect the people
of this city.

25:15.799 --> 25:17.282
I know that.

25:17.284 --> 25:19.334
And all we ask is
one thing in return;

25:19.336 --> 25:21.503
the one thing
that brought all those cops

25:21.505 --> 25:22.771
to that funeral today.

25:22.773 --> 25:24.656
You think I'm being disloyal?

25:26.259 --> 25:27.809
Is that how you feel about this?

25:27.811 --> 25:29.627
That I'm betraying the family?

25:30.897 --> 25:32.230
I think you were in a tough spot

25:32.232 --> 25:34.099
and you did
what you thought was right.

25:34.934 --> 25:37.436
I see.

25:38.321 --> 25:40.689
Okay, well, clearly I am
not welcome here.

25:40.691 --> 25:41.673
So, bye.

25:41.675 --> 25:43.775
Mom...!
Wait, Erin, don't go.

25:43.777 --> 25:44.776
You know, for the record--

25:44.778 --> 25:46.978
loyalty is a two-way street.

25:54.921 --> 25:56.455
How did the direct go
on the Benson case?

25:56.457 --> 25:58.173
It didn't.

25:58.175 --> 26:00.158
Oh, I thought you were putting
the arresting officer

26:00.160 --> 26:01.593
on the stand today.

26:01.595 --> 26:04.346
I would have if he'd
bothered to show up.

26:04.348 --> 26:05.964
No phone call, nothing.

26:05.966 --> 26:08.433
Same thing happened to Paul
on his domestic assault case.

26:08.435 --> 26:10.969
Call the ICO
of the precinct and...

26:10.971 --> 26:14.172
Don't bother.
Would you excuse us?

26:15.625 --> 26:18.560
Walk with me.

26:18.562 --> 26:19.945
What's going on?

26:19.947 --> 26:21.863
So far we've had
five reported no-shows

26:21.865 --> 26:24.116
by police officers
scheduled to testify.

26:24.118 --> 26:25.867
All from the same precinct.

26:25.869 --> 26:27.703
Officer Collins' precinct?

26:27.705 --> 26:29.687
Blue Flu is bad
for business, Erin.

26:29.689 --> 26:31.990
And it has a nasty habit
of spreading.

26:31.992 --> 26:34.192
So this precinct intends
to boycott our office

26:34.194 --> 26:35.961
until we charge Angelo Reid?

26:35.963 --> 26:36.995
That's blackmail.

26:36.997 --> 26:38.547
That's payback.

26:38.549 --> 26:40.916
They know most criminal
convictions can't be secured

26:40.918 --> 26:42.167
without their testimony.

26:42.169 --> 26:44.152
Well, we can force them
to appear.

26:44.154 --> 26:45.420
Word of advice.

26:45.422 --> 26:46.888
When your house is on fire,

26:46.890 --> 26:48.890
don't reach for the gasoline.

26:52.311 --> 26:54.146
How many cases
we talking about?

26:54.148 --> 26:55.781
Five no-shows

26:55.783 --> 26:56.915
in Collins' precinct,

26:56.917 --> 26:58.984
another three from the 15th.

26:58.986 --> 27:01.086
Can't be sure they're connected.

27:01.088 --> 27:03.488
I've never been a big believer
in coincidence.

27:03.490 --> 27:05.107
Press have it yet?

27:05.109 --> 27:06.475
<i>Daily News</i> is running

27:06.477 --> 27:08.276
a Blue Flu cover
in the morning.

27:10.079 --> 27:11.163
Dino?

27:11.165 --> 27:12.697
They're pretty pissed
down there.

27:12.699 --> 27:14.449
Reid walking was a
slap in the face,

27:14.451 --> 27:17.319
and now we're protecting him.

27:17.321 --> 27:18.703
Who's behind it?

27:18.705 --> 27:20.689
I'd rather not say.

27:22.108 --> 27:23.625
(sighs)
Who ordered it?

27:23.627 --> 27:25.427
Jim Kelsey.

27:25.429 --> 27:27.212
Suspend him.

27:29.515 --> 27:30.916
Why didn't you tell me
about this?

27:30.918 --> 27:33.084
They lost a fellow officer.

27:33.086 --> 27:36.555
That kind of sacrifice
deserves respect.

27:36.557 --> 27:38.590
Not like this.

27:38.592 --> 27:40.258
Kelsey put the department
in a hell of a spot.

27:40.260 --> 27:42.928
We've got a major PR problem.

27:42.930 --> 27:43.995
You're talking PR?

27:43.997 --> 27:45.447
No offense, Garrett,
but you never walked

27:45.449 --> 27:47.149
a beat a day in your life.

27:47.151 --> 27:48.366
I'm doing my job.

27:48.368 --> 27:49.785
Maybe you should give it a try.

27:49.787 --> 27:50.786
You don't know what it's like

27:50.788 --> 27:52.988
to watch your partner
die in your arms.

27:52.990 --> 27:55.240
I do.

27:57.210 --> 27:59.411
Blue Flu stops now.

28:11.624 --> 28:13.675
Hi.

28:13.677 --> 28:16.595
Hey.

28:21.350 --> 28:23.218
You want to sit?

28:29.692 --> 28:32.194
(clears throat)

28:32.196 --> 28:34.979
I want to thank you.

28:34.981 --> 28:38.416
I understand the officers
will be testifying again.

28:38.418 --> 28:40.585
They weren't too
happy about it.

28:40.587 --> 28:42.921
I figured.

28:42.923 --> 28:46.424
It takes a lot to push them
into something like this.

28:46.426 --> 28:48.910
So, you do think I screwed up.

28:48.912 --> 28:51.496
I think...

28:51.498 --> 28:54.616
that your grandfather
went too far.

28:54.618 --> 28:58.186
This isn't a question
of your loyalty to our family.

28:58.188 --> 29:00.789
Thank you.

29:00.791 --> 29:02.340
Cops and prosecutors...

29:02.342 --> 29:04.726
have different sets of rules.

29:04.728 --> 29:06.444
Meaning?

29:07.346 --> 29:09.865
Well...

29:09.867 --> 29:13.017
I got a hunch you remember
the four by 100 relay

29:13.019 --> 29:15.070
at the state high school finals.

29:15.072 --> 29:16.821
Yeah, I dropped the baton.

29:16.823 --> 29:18.790
Thank you for reminding me.

29:18.792 --> 29:21.159
When the baton gets dropped,

29:21.161 --> 29:23.345
both runners are responsible.

29:24.330 --> 29:26.281
You and I both know

29:26.283 --> 29:28.466
your brother can go too far.

29:30.703 --> 29:32.370
But he is doing everything

29:32.372 --> 29:34.923
he can possibly do

29:34.925 --> 29:37.092
to get justice here.

29:38.594 --> 29:39.678
Are you?

29:50.356 --> 29:52.991
Yo, yo, yo!
Checking in for the night!

29:52.993 --> 29:54.559
(groans)

29:54.561 --> 29:56.661
I'd really love to slap
that guy around.

29:56.663 --> 29:59.347
A few more hours, we'll be
off this detail for good.

29:59.349 --> 30:02.167
You think they'll
make a case for him?

30:02.169 --> 30:03.518
I don't know.

30:03.520 --> 30:06.104
(sighs)

30:08.240 --> 30:11.026
We got company.

30:13.179 --> 30:14.029
That's Ricky Salazar.

30:14.031 --> 30:15.297
Collins' parer.

30:15.299 --> 30:16.414
Come on, let's go.

30:16.416 --> 30:17.849
W-Wait, you're-you're gonna go

30:17.851 --> 30:20.752
against Salazar and the guy
who killed his partner?

30:20.754 --> 30:22.938
No, but we don't really
have much choice.

30:22.940 --> 30:25.807
Yeah, I didn't take this job
to go against other cops.

30:25.809 --> 30:26.775
Fine, stay here.

30:26.777 --> 30:28.276
If things go bad, call a 10-85.

30:29.695 --> 30:30.895
Hey, Ricky.

30:30.897 --> 30:32.230
Hey!
This doesn't concern you, Reagan.

30:32.232 --> 30:34.065
Hey, hey! Hey!

30:34.067 --> 30:35.951
I've got unfinished business
with this guy.

30:35.953 --> 30:37.736
You don't want to do this.

30:38.955 --> 30:39.988
Reid needs to pay
for your partner.

30:39.990 --> 30:41.556
But this is
not the way to do it.

30:41.558 --> 30:43.625
Are you standing up
for this guy?

30:45.077 --> 30:46.294
Huh?

30:46.296 --> 30:47.912
Hurting Reid won't bring
your partner back.

30:47.914 --> 30:49.347
And you'll go to jail.

30:49.349 --> 30:51.949
Which means Reid
takes out two cops.

30:51.951 --> 30:54.302
It's not worth it, Ricky.

30:54.304 --> 30:56.221
Go home.

30:56.223 --> 30:57.555
What if I don't?

30:57.557 --> 31:00.091
You guys leave right now,
and this never happened.

31:00.093 --> 31:02.126
You want Reid...

31:02.128 --> 31:04.396
then you got to
go through me.

31:10.803 --> 31:12.570
Me, too.

31:26.702 --> 31:27.985
(quietly):
Let's get out of here.

31:27.987 --> 31:30.038
Let's go.

32:04.546 --> 32:06.881
I know I'm not your
favorite person right now.

32:06.883 --> 32:08.766
You're not welcome
around here.

32:08.768 --> 32:10.068
We need to talk, Danny.

32:10.070 --> 32:11.385
So, talk.

32:11.387 --> 32:13.771
You blame me for Reid walking.

32:13.773 --> 32:15.191
No argument here.

32:15.192 --> 32:18.110
Okay, well,
maybe I could've done better,

32:18.112 --> 32:19.995
but you did manipulate
that witness.

32:19.997 --> 32:22.114
Maybe I crossed the line.
So what?

32:22.116 --> 32:23.698
I did what the
hell I had to do

32:23.700 --> 32:25.450
to get that scumbag
off the street.

32:25.452 --> 32:27.235
Yeah, and then
you stonewalled me,

32:27.237 --> 32:31.206
which I...
may have taken personally.

32:31.208 --> 32:33.959
Okay, so maybe
I made it personal.

32:33.961 --> 32:35.760
Okay, so neither of us

32:35.762 --> 32:38.847
did our best work here.

32:38.849 --> 32:40.765
I guess we didn't.

32:40.767 --> 32:44.352
But now there's a cop killer
on the street.

32:49.725 --> 32:52.611
Appreciate you
coming back in.

32:52.613 --> 32:54.095
Well, it's the least
I can do.

32:54.097 --> 32:56.764
You guys have been taking
such good care of me.

32:56.766 --> 32:58.283
You understand you're
not under arrest.

32:58.285 --> 32:59.568
You're free to leave
at any time.

32:59.570 --> 33:01.036
The rights I read
to you still apply,

33:01.038 --> 33:03.004
even though you've declined
to have an attorney.

33:03.006 --> 33:04.939
I don't need a lawyer
to deal with you.

33:04.941 --> 33:06.992
No, you don't need one yet.

33:06.994 --> 33:08.643
You are aware
of the fact

33:08.645 --> 33:11.213
that Joey Fabrizio
gave you up, right?

33:11.215 --> 33:12.497
(chuckles)

33:12.499 --> 33:14.916
Yeah, nice try.

33:14.918 --> 33:16.084
In his dying declaration,

33:16.086 --> 33:17.785
he copped to robbing
that jewelry store

33:17.787 --> 33:20.955
and made you as his partner...
and also,

33:20.957 --> 33:22.340
as the shooter.

33:22.342 --> 33:24.009
Then why not
just arrest me, hmm?

33:24.011 --> 33:25.960
Stick me
in front of a judge right now.

33:25.962 --> 33:28.063
That'll happen soon enough;
but in the meantime,

33:28.065 --> 33:30.098
I wanted to be
the first person on earth

33:30.100 --> 33:32.400
to let you know that you will
spend the rest of

33:32.402 --> 33:35.153
your miserable life
behind bars, you piece of crap.

33:38.824 --> 33:39.791
What do you want?

33:39.793 --> 33:41.026
Good afternoon, Mr. Reid.

33:41.028 --> 33:42.827
I'm Erin Reagan
with the D.A.'s Office.

33:42.829 --> 33:45.280
AKA his guardian angel.

33:45.282 --> 33:46.831
You already let
this guy walk once.

33:46.833 --> 33:48.867
What the hell are you doing?
I'm not done questioning him.

33:48.869 --> 33:51.786
Has the detective informed
you about the new information?

33:51.788 --> 33:54.105
He never proved Joey gave me up.

33:54.107 --> 33:56.658
Hopefully, I won't have to.
I'm here to offer you a deal.

33:56.660 --> 33:57.876
You're what?!

33:57.878 --> 33:59.177
If you plead guilty,

33:59.179 --> 34:00.595
I am authorized to offer you

34:00.597 --> 34:03.882
a sentence of seven years parole
after five.

34:03.884 --> 34:07.385
Whoa! Seven years for
a cop killer?! Are you crazy?!

34:07.387 --> 34:09.271
In light of the controversy
surrounding this case

34:09.273 --> 34:11.273
and the fact that the critical
witness is deceased,

34:11.275 --> 34:13.275
my office would like
to avoid a trial.

34:13.277 --> 34:15.277
That is ridiculous.
This is not happening.

34:15.279 --> 34:17.445
This is not your call,
Detective.

34:17.447 --> 34:20.916
I think you're dealing 'cause
you know you can't win.

34:20.918 --> 34:22.183
You are free to reject the deal.

34:22.185 --> 34:24.034
In which case,

34:24.036 --> 34:26.054
this will go to trial
on a charge of

34:26.056 --> 34:29.107
murder one, punishable
by life without parole.

34:29.109 --> 34:30.574
Life without parole.
That's right.

34:30.577 --> 34:32.694
That's exactly what
he's gonna get and no less.

34:39.368 --> 34:41.703
I need to think about it.

34:41.705 --> 34:44.356
The deal expires in one hour.

34:44.358 --> 34:48.009
You can write your statement
and then make your decision.

34:48.011 --> 34:50.195
But even if I write down
my statement,

34:50.197 --> 34:53.063
I could still turn down
the deal, right?

34:53.065 --> 34:55.016
Absolutely.

34:58.638 --> 35:00.071
What do you think
you're doing?

35:00.073 --> 35:01.723
You're not making...
Hey...

35:01.725 --> 35:03.158
you got a pen?

35:03.160 --> 35:05.577
Stick this thing
in your eye.

35:11.701 --> 35:13.835
The "guardian angel"
was a little over the top.

35:13.837 --> 35:15.337
Everyone's a critic.
All right, so, what?

35:15.339 --> 35:16.671
We get him to sign
the confession,

35:16.673 --> 35:18.607
and then we got him
on murder one, right?

35:18.609 --> 35:19.708
No, not exactly.

35:19.710 --> 35:22.427
We need him
to explicitly reject the deal.

35:22.429 --> 35:25.079
And what if we don't?

35:25.081 --> 35:28.633
Then I need to honor
the terms of the agreement.

35:28.635 --> 35:30.518
No, no, no,
you're-you're telling me

35:30.520 --> 35:33.138
that he could actually only get
seven years for killing a cop?

35:33.140 --> 35:34.639
I had to dangle the deal
in front of him

35:34.641 --> 35:35.857
to make sure that he confessed.

35:35.859 --> 35:37.942
If-if we can get him
to turn it down,

35:37.944 --> 35:40.445
then we have the confession,
we put him away.

35:40.447 --> 35:42.981
And if we can't get him
to reject the deal?

35:42.983 --> 35:48.236
Well, then I'll have a lot more
free time on my hands.

35:49.372 --> 35:51.039
So what do we do now?

35:51.041 --> 35:54.826
You keep playing bad cop, and
I'll keep my fingers crossed.

36:04.954 --> 36:06.838
I hope I didn't keep
you waiting.

36:06.840 --> 36:09.290
You didn't.

36:09.292 --> 36:11.976
Henry Haywood's
buried over there.

36:11.978 --> 36:14.612
Motor patrolman, volunteered
for Teddy's Rough Riders,

36:14.614 --> 36:16.164
died on San Juan Hill.

36:16.166 --> 36:18.400
We've been burying
New York cops here

36:18.402 --> 36:20.635
for over a century.

36:20.637 --> 36:25.139
Police Arlington is like a history
of our department,

36:25.141 --> 36:27.642
history of the fallen.

36:27.644 --> 36:30.795
We're not doing enough
to honor their memory.

36:30.797 --> 36:33.832
I'd like to help with
the restoration campaign.

36:36.118 --> 36:37.836
Somehow I knew
I wouldn't have to ask.

36:37.838 --> 36:38.953
Thank you.

36:38.955 --> 36:40.655
Yes, sir.

36:40.657 --> 36:42.990
Tough couple of days.

36:42.992 --> 36:44.776
Yeah.

36:44.778 --> 36:47.796
You crossed a line, Dino.

36:47.798 --> 36:50.865
I'm sorry
you feel that way.

36:50.867 --> 36:54.436
How I feel... isn't the point.

36:56.439 --> 37:00.341
How you understand your job,
that is the point.

37:00.343 --> 37:03.845
Sometimes you're not gonna
like yourself very much

37:03.847 --> 37:06.197
for the decisions
you have to make;

37:06.199 --> 37:12.353
knowing how the men feel
about the decision you made...

37:12.355 --> 37:14.989
but you're gonna have
to make that tough decision

37:14.991 --> 37:17.692
again and again

37:17.694 --> 37:19.878
because that is the job
you accepted.

37:19.880 --> 37:21.679
I get that.

37:21.681 --> 37:23.698
No, you don't.

37:26.419 --> 37:28.720
But you will.

37:31.173 --> 37:33.925
I made you my Chief of
Department because I had

37:33.927 --> 37:36.928
every confidence
in your ability to do that job.

37:36.930 --> 37:38.897
Thank you.

37:38.899 --> 37:41.850
But if you ever withhold vital
information from me again,

37:41.852 --> 37:43.518
you'll be gone in a heartbeat.

37:57.366 --> 37:59.784
Have you completed
your statement, Mr. Reid?

37:59.786 --> 38:01.920
Yeah, it's all here.

38:01.922 --> 38:03.037
Thank you.

38:03.039 --> 38:06.424
And have you decided
to accept the plea deal?

38:06.426 --> 38:09.761
Seven years, parole in five.

38:11.180 --> 38:12.647
You'll put that in writing?

38:12.649 --> 38:14.081
Of course.

38:15.267 --> 38:17.235
This is baloney. Hey.

38:17.237 --> 38:19.304
You can't do this.
What the hell

38:19.306 --> 38:20.638
did I come up
with that fake story

38:20.640 --> 38:22.423
about Joey Fabrizio
giving him up for

38:22.425 --> 38:24.392
if you're gonna give him
a sweetheart of a deal?!

38:24.394 --> 38:26.311
Detective, you shut up!
You're supposed to put him away!

38:26.313 --> 38:27.729
Do not listen to the detective!

38:27.731 --> 38:28.596
You can't do...
Hey!

38:28.598 --> 38:29.931
You stop!

38:29.933 --> 38:30.899
Hold on a second.

38:30.901 --> 38:32.099
Hold-hold-hold on a second.

38:33.202 --> 38:34.936
He just said
Joey never gave me up.

38:34.938 --> 38:37.071
No...
He's right. I did say that.

38:37.073 --> 38:39.023
Which means you got no case.

38:39.025 --> 38:41.793
No, no, no, we have a deal
in place, Mr. Reid.

38:41.795 --> 38:43.277
You said I could reject
that offer

38:43.279 --> 38:46.080
even if I wrote down
a statement...

38:46.082 --> 38:47.465
right?

38:47.467 --> 38:50.468
That's right, she did say that.

38:55.908 --> 38:58.810
Then consider it rejected.

39:00.029 --> 39:02.797
Did you just hear the subject
reject the deal, Detective?

39:03.415 --> 39:05.233
Yes, I did, in fact,

39:05.235 --> 39:07.986
hear the subject
reject the deal, Counselor.

39:09.021 --> 39:10.905
Then, in light of
Mr. Reid's confession,

39:10.907 --> 39:13.908
please book him on
a charge of murder one.

39:13.910 --> 39:14.976
Get on your feet.
Get on...

39:14.978 --> 39:15.977
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

39:15.979 --> 39:17.144
What the hell
you talking about?!

39:17.146 --> 39:19.480
I only confessed
'cause you offered me a deal!

39:19.482 --> 39:21.332
Which you just rejected.
I never said

39:21.334 --> 39:23.918
that your confession would be
thrown out with that deal.

39:23.920 --> 39:25.319
Did I ever say that, Detective?

39:25.321 --> 39:27.255
No, you didn't
say that, Counselor.

39:27.257 --> 39:29.424
No, your confession remained
perfectly valid

39:29.426 --> 39:31.276
and admissible evidence.

39:31.278 --> 39:32.377
No, you set me up.

39:32.379 --> 39:33.628
No, you set yourself up.

39:33.630 --> 39:35.830
You lying bitch!
Hey!

39:35.832 --> 39:38.349
You...! (grunts)

39:38.351 --> 39:41.386
And you are going
to die in prison.

39:42.504 --> 39:44.022
DANNY:
Come on.

39:50.813 --> 39:52.730
EDDIE:
Hey!

39:52.732 --> 39:54.015
Hey.

39:58.353 --> 40:01.739
I feel like I owe you
an apology.

40:01.741 --> 40:03.024
No, you don't.

40:03.026 --> 40:04.191
No, I do.

40:04.193 --> 40:05.526
What happened with Salazar,

40:05.528 --> 40:08.079
I wasn't...
sure how to handle that.

40:08.081 --> 40:10.298
It's a difficult situation.

40:10.300 --> 40:11.833
You backed me up.

40:11.835 --> 40:12.834
We're good.

40:12.836 --> 40:14.201
Listen...

40:14.203 --> 40:16.037
I became a cop because

40:16.039 --> 40:18.723
I thought there was always
gonna be a clear line

40:18.725 --> 40:20.141
between right and wrong.

40:20.143 --> 40:22.143
Usually is.

40:22.145 --> 40:27.849
Well... I wanted you to know
that I respected what you did.

40:29.551 --> 40:32.053
I'm really glad
we're riding together.

40:39.194 --> 40:41.245
Is that yours?

40:41.247 --> 40:46.200
Oh, yeah, it's a high school
graduation present from my dad.

40:46.202 --> 40:48.353
It's really fast.

40:48.355 --> 40:50.371
Don't hold it against me.

41:03.535 --> 41:05.937
This photographer actually
did a pretty good job.

41:05.939 --> 41:09.641
Yeah. I like this one.

41:11.193 --> 41:12.727
Danny's making

41:12.729 --> 41:13.978
a pretty funny face, though.

41:13.980 --> 41:15.697
That's why I like it.

41:17.066 --> 41:18.599
FRANK:
Hey.

41:18.601 --> 41:19.734
Hi.

41:19.736 --> 41:20.918
What's going on?

41:20.920 --> 41:22.370
Nothing.

41:22.372 --> 41:24.756
I was just in the neighborhood.

41:28.594 --> 41:30.094
I see.

41:30.096 --> 41:33.297
And maybe I could use a drink.

41:33.299 --> 41:34.782
You got it.

41:37.720 --> 41:39.470
I smell cookies.

41:39.472 --> 41:40.722
Hey.

41:41.757 --> 41:46.144
Hey, don't use the one of me
with the funny face.

41:46.146 --> 41:48.096
It's not that bad.

41:48.098 --> 41:51.132
You know...

41:51.134 --> 41:53.634
when one of our own goes down,
we step it up a notch...

41:55.487 --> 41:57.355
...especially this family.

41:57.357 --> 42:00.692
We're all in the same business,

42:00.694 --> 42:02.777
but we all have different jobs.

42:05.964 --> 42:08.616
Sometimes it's easy to forget

42:08.618 --> 42:10.418
we're all on the same side.

42:10.420 --> 42:12.420
Anyway...

42:12.422 --> 42:16.174
I understand that Angelo Reid
was booked on murder charges.

42:17.276 --> 42:20.595
Must be a hell of a story.

42:21.847 --> 42:23.681
I'd like to hear it.

42:23.683 --> 42:25.266
Me, too.

42:26.351 --> 42:29.137
He confessed.

42:31.807 --> 42:32.924
That's it?

42:32.926 --> 42:35.309
Yeah. No big deal.

42:38.914 --> 42:40.531
Okay.

42:43.035 --> 42:44.952
To Officer Lori Collins.

42:46.822 --> 42:48.823
To all the fallen.

42:50.409 --> 42:52.627
And to Joe.
