WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:01.502
.

00:01.535 --> 00:02.002
- We gotta protect Leon.

00:03.371 --> 00:05.139
Cruz, he's gotta
get out of town.

00:05.173 --> 00:06.140
- How long?
- For a long time.

00:06.174 --> 00:08.776
Maybe forever.

00:08.809 --> 00:10.511
- You're really lucky,
you know that?

00:10.544 --> 00:13.614
You're such a close-knit group.
It's like family.

00:13.647 --> 00:16.384
- Your friend Hope has been
visiting the firehouse a lot.

00:16.417 --> 00:19.153
- I think she might be dealing
with something back at home.

00:19.187 --> 00:20.288
- Don't forget you
made a promise

00:20.321 --> 00:22.190
we'd hang out before I left.

00:22.223 --> 00:24.425
- That's not the kind of thing
that slips my mind.

00:30.731 --> 00:33.701
[upbeat music]

00:33.734 --> 00:41.142
*

00:50.518 --> 00:54.422
- Yo, Kelly!

00:54.455 --> 00:57.258
Train is leaving the station.

01:00.661 --> 01:02.830
- Hey.

01:02.863 --> 01:06.134
- Hi, hey.
- [giggles]

01:07.835 --> 01:09.503
Do you guys,
um, want some coffee?

01:09.537 --> 01:11.805
I could run out to--
- Oh, we get coffee at work.

01:11.839 --> 01:14.842
- Oh, right, sure.
[giggles]

01:14.875 --> 01:16.577
- [grunts]

01:16.610 --> 01:19.813
I'm just gonna get myself
to the house this morning.

01:19.847 --> 01:21.449
- Okay, cool.
Sounds good.

01:21.482 --> 01:25.319
Uh, I'll see you up there.
And, uh...

01:25.353 --> 01:27.888
Hope, right?
- Yeah.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.291
- Great seeing you.

01:31.492 --> 01:32.660
- [giggles]

01:35.763 --> 01:37.331
- Whose buggy is that?

01:37.365 --> 01:39.433
- Ah, Boden's out first
half of shift.

01:39.467 --> 01:43.337
We got some chief named Mullins.
- You know him?

01:43.371 --> 01:45.439
- I heard he was a bear.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.710
- Is that everyone?

01:52.646 --> 01:55.149
As I always tell
the men serving under me--

01:55.183 --> 01:58.319
- Hey, uh,
sorry, Chief.

01:58.352 --> 02:00.454
- As I was saying,
on my watch,

02:00.488 --> 02:03.191
if you're not 15 minutes early,
you're 15 minutes late.

02:03.224 --> 02:05.393
The shift before you
appreciates your punctuality,

02:05.426 --> 02:08.229
as I'm sure you do
the shift that follows.

02:08.262 --> 02:10.464
That said, I'm only at 51
for half a shift,

02:10.498 --> 02:13.167
and I've got nothing but respect
for Wallace Boden.

02:13.201 --> 02:14.802
So let's all power through
the next few hours

02:14.835 --> 02:16.404
and get you back
in his capable hands.

02:16.437 --> 02:17.771
Sound good.?
all: Yes, sir.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.907
- Okay, good.
Assignments.

02:19.940 --> 02:22.310
Let's empty out all
the compartments on the rigs.

02:22.343 --> 02:24.212
We'll clean, check, and do
maintenance on the equipment

02:24.245 --> 02:25.813
and you can scrub and wax
the inside shelving.

02:25.846 --> 02:29.417
Once that's complete--

02:30.284 --> 02:31.919
Is there a problem?
- No, Chief.

02:31.952 --> 02:35.389
It's just, Tuesdays we usually
only do the side compartments.

02:35.423 --> 02:37.458
And like you said,
it's only half a shift.

02:38.959 --> 02:41.862
- What's your name, Lieutenant?
- Matt Casey, Chief.

02:41.895 --> 02:46.834
- The firefighting alderman.
- Former alderman.

02:47.735 --> 02:49.703
- Once that's complete,
let's get the app floor

02:49.737 --> 02:53.341
swept and mopped--
if you don't mind.

02:53.374 --> 02:55.809
- Consider it done,
Chief.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.678
- Dismissed.

02:57.711 --> 03:00.681
[tense music]

03:00.714 --> 03:04.952
*

03:04.985 --> 03:06.354
- Sorry, guys.
- It's fine.

03:06.387 --> 03:07.621
Half a shift.

03:07.655 --> 03:09.557
What's the worst
that could happen?

03:09.590 --> 03:11.925
- Question asked by nearly
every Darwin Award winner.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.327
[phone vibrates]

03:13.361 --> 03:15.463
- Uh, hey, guys.
I texted my buddy

03:15.496 --> 03:17.798
who served under Mullins
over at 78.

03:17.831 --> 03:19.333
- Yeah?
What'd he say?

03:19.367 --> 03:20.901
- "That man has killed
more careers

03:20.934 --> 03:23.537
in the CFD than actual fire."

03:23.571 --> 03:26.374
- Well, let's knuckle down
and not give him

03:26.407 --> 03:28.709
any reason to look our way.

03:28.742 --> 03:31.779
- You got it, Lieutenant.
[alarm blares]

03:31.812 --> 03:35.015
- Ambulance 61,
4200 North Walcott Avenue.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.016
Bicycle accident.

03:36.049 --> 03:39.019
[sirens wailing]

03:39.052 --> 03:42.022
[intense music]

03:42.055 --> 03:48.996
*

03:49.029 --> 03:52.366
- Oh, God.
Oh, God.

03:53.033 --> 03:54.835
It's like she came out
of nowhere.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.337
I didn't see her.

03:56.370 --> 03:57.971
I looked down for one second.

03:58.005 --> 04:01.275
*

04:01.309 --> 04:03.477
- Hi, honey.
What's your name?

04:03.511 --> 04:05.979
- Ella.
- Ella?

04:06.013 --> 04:07.681
- I'm Sylvie.
This is Gabby.

04:07.715 --> 04:10.351
We're here to help.
Can you tell me what hurts?

04:10.384 --> 04:12.586
- Just my wrist.
- Is she gonna be okay?

04:12.620 --> 04:14.054
- Ella, can you lie down for us?

04:14.087 --> 04:15.889
We're gonna slide
this under you.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.959
- She said it's her wrist.
- Sir, you need to let us work.

04:18.992 --> 04:20.994
- Here you go.

04:21.028 --> 04:23.331
*

04:23.364 --> 04:25.733
- [groans]

04:25.766 --> 04:27.501
*

04:27.535 --> 04:29.903
- Is he okay?
- Don't worry about him.

04:29.937 --> 04:32.373
Can you squeeze my hand?

04:32.406 --> 04:34.342
- I think there's something
wrong with him.

04:34.375 --> 04:39.813
*

04:39.847 --> 04:40.981
- You gotta be kidding me.

04:41.014 --> 04:44.785
*

04:44.818 --> 04:46.887
No pulse.
This is 61

04:46.920 --> 04:49.790
requesting a backup ambulance
for a possible cardiac arrest.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.959
- Copy that, 61.

04:51.992 --> 04:58.766
*

04:58.799 --> 05:00.334
[beeping]

05:00.368 --> 05:01.402
- He's in V-tach.
We need to shock him.

05:01.435 --> 05:03.571
- Is he okay?

05:05.839 --> 05:07.441
What happened?

05:07.475 --> 05:09.477
- All right,
let's concentrate on you, okay?

05:09.510 --> 05:11.011
- I'm okay.
What happened?

05:11.044 --> 05:13.347
- Okay, Ella, listen to me.
The best way that you

05:13.381 --> 05:14.748
can help him
is to stay calm.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.750
That way Gabby can concentrate,
okay?

05:16.784 --> 05:19.086
- Shocking.
[electric shocks]

05:19.119 --> 05:20.421
He's back.

05:20.454 --> 05:21.955
- [heavy breathing]

05:21.989 --> 05:23.657
- Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.426
- I gotta get out of here.
I gotta get somewhere.

05:25.459 --> 05:26.694
- Sir, you lost consciousness.

05:26.727 --> 05:28.396
We need to get you
to a hospital.

05:28.429 --> 05:29.963
Dispatch, where's
that second ambo?

05:29.997 --> 05:31.832
- I had a heart attack?
- Just lie back down for me,

05:31.865 --> 05:32.866
okay?

05:32.900 --> 05:34.368
- Hey, eyes on me, okay?

05:34.402 --> 05:35.969
Where are your parents?
- Work.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.138
I know my mom's number.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.707
- Had a mix up, 61.
Ten minutes.

05:39.740 --> 05:42.109
I'll start you in a company.

05:42.142 --> 05:44.111
- What's wrong?

05:44.144 --> 05:46.514
*

05:46.547 --> 05:48.048
- Okay, Ella,
we're gonna take you both

05:48.081 --> 05:50.017
in the same ambulance, okay?
We're gonna call your mom

05:50.050 --> 05:51.685
on the way.
- Okay.

05:51.719 --> 05:52.520
- Okay.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.588
*

05:54.622 --> 05:56.457
- We gotta take them to Med,
and we can't leave her alone.

05:56.490 --> 05:57.458
It's our only choice.

05:57.491 --> 05:59.126
*

05:59.159 --> 06:00.594
Dispatch, we're gonna
transport two patients

06:00.628 --> 06:03.130
to Chicago Med.
One, two, three.

06:03.163 --> 06:10.571
*

06:16.777 --> 06:19.513
- [whistles]

06:19.547 --> 06:21.715
- What are you whistling
sunshine about up there?

06:21.749 --> 06:25.486
- Ah, nothing.
Toss me that rag.

06:25.519 --> 06:27.455
- All right, spill it.

06:27.488 --> 06:30.624
- What, I can't find
cleaning therapeutic?

06:30.658 --> 06:33.060
- No.

06:33.093 --> 06:35.496
- All right.

06:38.198 --> 06:41.101
I flew Leon in
for Cruz's birthday.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.771
- What?
- Who is Leon?

06:43.804 --> 06:47.007
- Cruz's kid brother.
- Cruz's kid brother who lives

06:47.040 --> 06:49.176
in Florida now because it's
not safe for him to be here.

06:49.209 --> 06:50.644
- That's all blown over.

06:50.678 --> 06:52.546
Trudy checked with
the gang unit.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.515
The street corners have
changed over three times.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.484
Nobody even knows
who Leon is anymore.

06:56.517 --> 06:58.519
- You sure about that?

07:00.120 --> 07:02.490
- Do you doubt my wife?

07:02.523 --> 07:05.493
[tense music]

07:05.526 --> 07:07.194
*

07:07.227 --> 07:09.597
That's what I thought.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.999
- Cruz would love to see him.
- All we gotta do

07:12.032 --> 07:15.102
is get the birthday boy
to Molly's after shift,

07:15.135 --> 07:18.205
and in the meantime,
shh.

07:18.238 --> 07:20.508
*

07:20.541 --> 07:24.144
- This is gonna be great.
- [chuckles]

07:24.177 --> 07:28.949
*

07:31.251 --> 07:33.186
- So.
- So.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.922
- Brett's friend?
- Yep.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.924
- Mmm.
- What?

07:36.957 --> 07:38.959
- She's only here for, like,
another week.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.193
- Uh, tomorrow, actually.

07:40.227 --> 07:41.829
- Wow.
- All the information

07:41.862 --> 07:44.464
was on the table.
- Pfft.

07:46.700 --> 07:49.069
- Hey, how was it?
- It was a weird one.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.203
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

07:50.237 --> 07:52.239
We had this, um--
- 61.

07:52.272 --> 07:54.742
- Yes, Chief.
Brett and Dawson, sir.

07:54.775 --> 07:57.645
- Oh, I know your names.
You've just been reported to me.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.680
- Reported?
- You took two patients at once.

07:59.713 --> 08:01.014
- Chief, it was an
extraordinary situation.

08:01.048 --> 08:02.750
- Which is not to be done.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.918
Under any circumstances
without expressed consent

08:04.952 --> 08:06.987
from Chief Hatcher in
a triage event situation.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.856
- The second ambo was
nowhere to be found,

08:08.889 --> 08:10.658
and we had a crucial
cardiac patient.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.626
- You put an injured girl
in an ambulance

08:12.660 --> 08:14.528
with the man who
hit her with his car.

08:14.562 --> 08:15.929
That's a lawsuit
waiting to happen.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.731
- Sounds like they made
a judgment call

08:17.765 --> 08:19.900
in a challenging circumstance,
Chief.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.903
[intense music]

08:22.936 --> 08:24.137
*

08:24.171 --> 08:25.639
- I'm taking you out of service.

08:25.673 --> 08:26.774
- What?
- So you can fill out

08:26.807 --> 08:28.742
a detailed incident report.

08:28.776 --> 08:30.177
If you wanna defend
your actions,

08:30.210 --> 08:31.979
and if you want me as
acting battalion chief

08:32.012 --> 08:33.781
to defend your actions,
you need to do it

08:33.814 --> 08:35.182
with every "I" dotted
and every "T" crossed.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.750
You can return to service

08:36.784 --> 08:38.318
when I'm satisfied
with that paperwork,

08:38.351 --> 08:41.121
which I want on my desk
before I leave.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.990
- Chief,
all due respect--

08:43.023 --> 08:47.928
- Due respect would be
letting me handle this.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.763
Unless there's something
other than Lieutenant

08:49.797 --> 08:50.898
in front of your name.

08:50.931 --> 08:57.971
*

09:10.784 --> 09:10.951
.

09:10.984 --> 09:11.384
- [laughs]
Wow.

09:13.253 --> 09:15.723
Mullins just asked us
to wash the rigs.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.691
He didn't ask us
to itemize the work.

09:17.725 --> 09:18.792
- [sighs]
Maybe I should talk to him.

09:18.826 --> 09:20.327
Smooth things over.

09:20.360 --> 09:23.063
- Or just keep your head down
and stay out of his way.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.131
Works every time.

09:26.166 --> 09:30.638
- Sure.
Every time.

09:30.671 --> 09:33.206
- [laughs]

09:38.712 --> 09:41.882
How's it going?
- I already missed two calls

09:41.915 --> 09:44.117
because of this busywork.

09:44.151 --> 09:46.754
- Aww, we're almost done.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.388
- I really stepped in it
with this guy.

09:48.421 --> 09:51.391
- Oh, don't beat yourself up.
- Yeah, seemed unavoidable.

09:51.424 --> 09:54.728
- Well, I still
feel responsible.

09:54.762 --> 09:56.396
- Nonsense.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.899
- Is that how you're
gonna turn it in?

09:58.932 --> 10:00.400
A little hard to read.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.935
Like, I think you
rushed through it.

10:03.170 --> 10:05.272
I just think, with a stickler
like Chief Mullins,

10:05.305 --> 10:07.841
you probably want to put
your best foot forward and...

10:07.875 --> 10:11.945
You know what?
I'm just gonna...

10:16.784 --> 10:19.152
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Paul Pogue!

10:19.186 --> 10:21.021
What's up, man?
- Can't complain.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.690
We borrowed your strong arm
for that South Loop call.

10:22.723 --> 10:23.757
Where do you want it?

10:23.791 --> 10:25.759
- Right there is fine.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.828
- Hey, Cruz.
I gotta tell you, man.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.096
Leon looks great.
I didn't know

10:29.129 --> 10:30.163
he was back in Chicago.

10:31.331 --> 10:32.800
- He's not.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.234
- Really?
I could've sworn I saw him

10:34.267 --> 10:36.036
at Wiener Circle this morning
with a lady cop.

10:36.069 --> 10:38.171
- Hey, that must have been
somebody else.

10:38.205 --> 10:40.674
- You sure?

10:40.708 --> 10:42.876
- I think I would know
if my brother were in town

10:42.910 --> 10:44.311
for the first time
in three years.

10:44.344 --> 10:47.247
- [both laughing]

10:47.280 --> 10:49.917
- Must've been
his long lost twin, I guess.

10:49.950 --> 10:52.820
See you, guys.
- Later.

10:56.456 --> 10:58.258
[phone beeps]

10:58.291 --> 11:00.994
[ringing]

11:01.028 --> 11:02.162
- Hey, Leon.

11:02.195 --> 11:05.332
Give me a call
when you get this.

11:05.365 --> 11:08.435
- You're blown, man.
It's time to come clean.

11:08.468 --> 11:11.004
- We can still save this.
Number one,

11:11.038 --> 11:14.341
I will contact Leon and tell him
to throw Cruz off the scent.

11:14.374 --> 11:15.342
- That's good.
- Good?

11:15.375 --> 11:16.777
It's a disaster.

11:16.810 --> 11:19.813
- Yeah, what's number two?

11:19.847 --> 11:22.482
- I haven't gotten that far yet.

11:22.515 --> 11:26.219
*

11:26.253 --> 11:27.220
[knocking]

11:27.254 --> 11:28.822
- Yeah?

11:28.856 --> 11:30.290
- I just got
an interesting phone call.

11:30.323 --> 11:32.225
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

11:32.259 --> 11:34.461
You remember Captain Patterson?
- Of course.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.797
- He's been spending a lot
of time down at headquarters.

11:36.830 --> 11:39.366
And he says that Mullins
is on the short list

11:39.399 --> 11:42.102
to be the next Commissioner.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.403
- This is a joke.

11:43.436 --> 11:45.973
- Happening next summer.
According to Patterson.

11:46.006 --> 11:48.375
- Oy.
- Yeah.

11:48.408 --> 11:51.144
So, remember what I said
about not saying something?

11:53.480 --> 11:55.148
Maybe you should say something.

11:56.984 --> 12:00.954
- You wanna check my penmanship?
Be my guest.

12:00.988 --> 12:04.124
Fix this so I can get back
to doing my job.

12:15.836 --> 12:18.906
- How's it going?
- Got me reorganizing

12:18.939 --> 12:22.776
the red files.
Short staffed already.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.446
- He available?

12:26.479 --> 12:28.148
- Be my guest.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.319
[knocking at door]

12:33.486 --> 12:35.989
- Chief.
- Lieutenant.

12:38.258 --> 12:41.461
- Paramedics finished
the IR-3s and the IR-7s.

12:41.494 --> 12:43.330
Double-checked them myself.

12:48.435 --> 12:51.171
Listen, uh...

12:51.204 --> 12:54.842
I just want to apologize
for stepping on your toes.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.844
It won't happen again.

12:58.078 --> 12:59.980
I got off on
the wrong foot with you,

13:00.013 --> 13:01.815
and that's on me.

13:01.849 --> 13:04.317
So, I'm sorry.
Sincerely.

13:09.456 --> 13:12.525
I want you to know,
these are good people at 51.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.027
To a man.

13:14.061 --> 13:15.929
And they all take
the job seriously.

13:15.963 --> 13:19.066
They're all smoke eaters.
Even our paramedics.

13:21.869 --> 13:23.236
- You know what
I saw this morning

13:23.270 --> 13:25.973
when I parked on your apron,
Lieutenant?

13:27.941 --> 13:31.211
Two cigar butts,
half chewed,

13:31.244 --> 13:33.580
just lying on the pavement
outside the northeast door,

13:33.613 --> 13:36.183
tossed there without
a care in the world.

13:36.216 --> 13:39.086
And I said to myself,
what kind of pride

13:39.119 --> 13:41.221
does this house have?

13:41.254 --> 13:43.490
Who would disrespect
their home like that?

13:43.523 --> 13:45.092
[tense music]

13:45.125 --> 13:49.529
Well, I guess I found out.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.932
*

13:51.965 --> 13:54.935
- That's your response
to my apology?

13:54.968 --> 13:56.603
[alarms blare]

13:56.636 --> 14:00.040
- Truck 81, Ambulance 61,
515 North Monroe Street,

14:00.073 --> 14:01.574
possible jumper.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.610
- When is Boden back?
- In a couple of hours.

14:03.643 --> 14:06.279
*

14:06.313 --> 14:07.580
- Hallelujah.

14:07.614 --> 14:11.018
[sirens wailing]

14:12.619 --> 14:20.027
*

14:24.697 --> 14:26.366
- Negotiator's up
there with him,

14:26.399 --> 14:27.367
but it's gotten quiet.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.202
*

14:29.236 --> 14:31.538
- Herrmann, grab a rope bag
and come to the roof with me.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.974
Kidd, pike poles,
then you, Mouch, and Otis

14:34.007 --> 14:37.077
get access to the
top floor apartments.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.612
- Let's go.
- What you thinking, Lieutenant?

14:39.646 --> 14:42.415
- Saving Joe Citizen,
whether he wants it or not.

14:42.449 --> 14:49.456
*

14:56.529 --> 14:58.966
- This is the best idea
I've had in a long time.

14:58.999 --> 15:03.203
- No, Dan.
Trust me, it's not.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.672
I like you alive.
Why don't you come back

15:05.705 --> 15:08.375
from the edge, there?
It'd make me feel a lot better,

15:08.408 --> 15:10.510
and then we could have
a face-to face conversation.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.179
- No.
- Okay.

15:12.212 --> 15:15.582
Just one foot back.
Can you do that for me?

15:15.615 --> 15:19.719
Just the length of your foot,
just back a little bit?

15:19.752 --> 15:22.355
- Who's he?
- Hi, I'm Matt.

15:22.389 --> 15:24.057
I'm a firefighter.
- Get back.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.325
Don't come any closer.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.360
- I'll talk to him, Dan.
Don't worry.

15:27.394 --> 15:31.264
Matt and I are gonna talk
right over here, okay?

15:31.298 --> 15:35.168
I got a bad feeling.
He is way too calm.

15:35.202 --> 15:39.072
He said he's made up his mind.
- He been repeating it?

15:39.106 --> 15:40.440
- Twice.
- Damn.

15:40.473 --> 15:43.743
- Yeah.
You wanna try snatch and pull?

15:43.776 --> 15:45.478
- He'd jump before I got to him.

15:45.512 --> 15:48.448
*

15:48.481 --> 15:50.383
What's your comfort level
with something risky?

15:50.417 --> 15:52.719
- This guy's going.
Whatever you wanna try,

15:52.752 --> 15:54.187
I'm good with that.

15:54.221 --> 15:55.755
- I know you're
talking about me.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.490
I know what you're saying.
Same as everyone.

15:57.524 --> 15:59.759
Look at the loser.
- Just keep his focus.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.162
*

16:02.195 --> 16:04.731
- Come on now, Dan.
Nobody's talking about you.

16:04.764 --> 16:09.236
We're not talking about you.
We are not talking about you.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.504
- Yes you are, just like Rachel.
- Who's Rachel, Dan?

16:11.538 --> 16:12.705
- Nobody.

16:12.739 --> 16:14.374
- Hey, hey, hey,
look at me.

16:14.407 --> 16:17.077
Focus on me, Dan.
Is Rachel your girlfriend?

16:17.110 --> 16:18.411
Your wife?
- Sister.

16:18.445 --> 16:21.281
- Okay, okay, see?
See, there you go.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.650
I guarantee you Rachel
would want you

16:23.683 --> 16:25.518
to live through today, Dan.
- What are you doing?

16:25.552 --> 16:27.254
What are you doing?

16:27.287 --> 16:29.089
- There's a crowd down there.
We have to make sure

16:29.122 --> 16:30.190
they stay back.
- You want them to get back

16:30.223 --> 16:31.791
so I don't fall on them?

16:31.824 --> 16:35.662
- I just want everyone safe.
- You know what he's doing?

16:35.695 --> 16:36.763
- Whatever he has to.

16:36.796 --> 16:39.366
*

16:39.399 --> 16:41.134
- Talk to me about Rachel, Dan.

16:41.168 --> 16:42.535
Is there a number
I could reach her at?

16:42.569 --> 16:44.271
Let her know that
you're up here?

16:44.304 --> 16:45.405
- She can read about it
on the Internet.

16:45.438 --> 16:46.806
I've already made up my mind.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.476
*

16:49.509 --> 16:52.412
- Okay, just back a foot, Dan.
Can you do that for me?

16:52.445 --> 16:55.048
*

16:55.082 --> 16:58.051
Just back the length
of your foot.

16:58.085 --> 17:00.153
Just a little bit.

17:00.187 --> 17:01.754
Come on, Dan.
Let's get Rachel on the phone

17:01.788 --> 17:03.456
and see what she says.

17:03.490 --> 17:06.126
Ah, it'll just take a minute.
What's her number?

17:06.159 --> 17:07.160
Dan, what's her number?

17:07.194 --> 17:11.231
*

17:11.264 --> 17:13.066
- Lieutenant!

17:16.503 --> 17:16.669
.

17:16.703 --> 17:16.903
- Now!

17:18.738 --> 17:21.574
- [grunts]
No, no, no!

17:21.608 --> 17:22.775
- Call the medics
to the roof.

17:22.809 --> 17:24.644
- We're clear for
medical support.

17:24.677 --> 17:28.415
- You've ruined everything.
I made up my mind.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.483
I made up my mind.

17:30.517 --> 17:33.486
[dramatic music]

17:33.520 --> 17:36.789
*

17:36.823 --> 17:39.192
- Nice work, Matt.
That was a hell of a thing.

17:39.226 --> 17:40.193
- Nice work, yourself.

17:40.227 --> 17:45.698
*

17:45.732 --> 17:48.168
- [groans]
We got him sedated.

17:48.201 --> 17:50.103
- His blood pressure's high,
and his back is bruised,

17:50.137 --> 17:51.671
but he's gonna be fine.
- I'll track down his sister

17:51.704 --> 17:53.140
and let her know.
Where you taking him?

17:53.173 --> 17:54.274
- Med.
- Okay.

17:54.307 --> 18:01.281
*

18:01.314 --> 18:03.250
- Hallelujah.

18:03.283 --> 18:04.817
*

18:04.851 --> 18:07.187
- Yeah, I guess you couldn't
see it from down here,

18:07.220 --> 18:08.288
but that guy was gonna go.

18:08.321 --> 18:09.689
No question about it.

18:09.722 --> 18:11.491
He was calm.
He was using trigger words,

18:11.524 --> 18:13.160
so I made a call.

18:13.193 --> 18:14.694
Now, if it's liability
you're worried about,

18:14.727 --> 18:17.197
put it on me.
I'll take the heat.

18:17.230 --> 18:20.567
*

18:20.600 --> 18:21.834
Let's go.

18:21.868 --> 18:24.837
[dramatic music]

18:24.871 --> 18:32.111
*

18:33.180 --> 18:36.149
- We need some new games.
- What's wrong with dominos?

18:36.183 --> 18:37.684
- It's too much math.

18:41.188 --> 18:43.490
- Welcome back, Chief.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.731
- Hey there.
- Hi, Stella.

18:51.764 --> 18:53.333
- You looking for Kelly?
'Cause he's--

18:53.366 --> 18:56.336
- Oh, oh, no.
I, um...

18:56.369 --> 18:59.639
I'm actually here to, um--

19:00.707 --> 19:04.611
see Sylvie.
There she is.

19:04.644 --> 19:07.914
- Yep.
There she is.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.685
- [chuckles]
Am I crazy,

19:12.719 --> 19:14.887
or is there a weird
vibe here today?

19:14.921 --> 19:16.956
'Cause everyone seems way tense
out on the floor.

19:16.989 --> 19:20.493
- It's been a crazy shift.
What's up?

19:21.394 --> 19:23.763
- I've had the best time
being here in Chicago.

19:23.796 --> 19:25.632
- I'm so glad you came.
- You are?

19:25.665 --> 19:27.234
- Of course.
- 'cause I would never want

19:27.267 --> 19:29.236
to put you out or--
or get in your way.

19:29.269 --> 19:31.238
- You're not putting me out.
I've loved having you here.

19:31.271 --> 19:32.939
- [laughs]
Thanks.

19:32.972 --> 19:36.476
Oh, my mom sent me
a box of those cookies

19:36.509 --> 19:38.978
that you've always loved.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.547
The pecan ones.

19:40.580 --> 19:43.350
- That's so sweet.
Please thank her for me.

19:43.383 --> 19:46.353
I'm gonna see you again before
you leave for Fowlerton, right?

19:46.386 --> 19:47.454
- Definitely.
- Good.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.556
[sniffs]
- [laughs]

20:00.367 --> 20:02.001
- Maybe it's not that bad.

20:02.034 --> 20:05.605
- Herrmann said Mullins is pals
with half of Headquarters.

20:07.640 --> 20:10.577
I'm sure it'll be fine.
I'm just saying,

20:10.610 --> 20:12.812
his is not a good
naughty list to be on.

20:12.845 --> 20:15.282
- Guy wants to ding me,
let him ding me.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.817
He's got a stick up his ass
the size of the Sears Tower.

20:17.850 --> 20:20.753
- Mullins? He's gone.
I just saw Boden pull up.

20:20.787 --> 20:23.590
- Oh, thank God
for small favors.

20:27.594 --> 20:30.563
[goofy music]

20:30.597 --> 20:37.770
*

20:46.946 --> 20:48.748
- Don't shoot the messenger.

20:48.781 --> 20:51.718
- Why is there
said messenger to shoot, huh?

20:56.789 --> 20:58.958
What is he doing here?
- How should I know?

20:58.991 --> 21:01.794
I'm not part of
this cockamamie plan.

21:01.828 --> 21:03.363
- What are you doing here?

21:03.396 --> 21:04.964
- Joe keeps leaving
me messages, man.

21:04.997 --> 21:07.033
It's getting weird.
I just wanna tell him.

21:07.066 --> 21:10.036
Hey.
- Sup?

21:10.069 --> 21:11.738
- What's up with you?
- Leon.

21:11.771 --> 21:14.006
Focus.
We cannot tell your brother.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.075
We've come this far.
- Well, it's gotten stupid.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.945
- He's right, Mouch.
When he's right, he's right.

21:19.779 --> 21:22.815
- It's a surprise party.
- So we do the surprise now.

21:22.849 --> 21:24.751
- Yeah, Mouch, before
it gets out of hand.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.419
- O--okay.
All right.

21:26.453 --> 21:30.390
- Imagine, if you will,
Cruz walking into Molly's

21:30.423 --> 21:32.024
after shift.
Suddenly,

21:32.058 --> 21:36.363
all of his dearest friends
shout, "Happy Birthday."

21:36.396 --> 21:39.666
Oh, he's overjoyed.
Could it get any better?

21:39.699 --> 21:42.034
Yes, it could,
because out of the back

21:42.068 --> 21:46.038
comes the most important person
to him in the world.

21:46.072 --> 21:47.574
Leon.

21:47.607 --> 21:49.476
- Yeah, that does sound dope.
- I know, it does.

21:49.509 --> 21:51.711
I know it sounds dope.

21:51.744 --> 21:52.779
Hide him.

21:52.812 --> 21:59.986
*

22:02.922 --> 22:05.057
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

22:05.091 --> 22:07.794
What's going on with you?
- Not much.

22:07.827 --> 22:10.029
*

22:10.062 --> 22:12.765
- Chief wants everyone
in the bullpen.

22:12.799 --> 22:15.768
Five minutes.
- Uh, you mean right now?

22:15.802 --> 22:17.770
- What?
- I mean, he probably

22:17.804 --> 22:19.472
wants us there now?

22:19.506 --> 22:20.940
*

22:20.973 --> 22:22.809
- Hey, I'm just gonna--
- Why don't you just go--

22:22.842 --> 22:24.811
- I just wanna have my sandwich.
- Come on, let's go.

22:24.844 --> 22:28.381
- Check it out.
- So, I'm sorry I was gone

22:28.415 --> 22:31.083
this morning.
I had a seminar to teach

22:31.117 --> 22:33.820
at the academy, and, uh,
feeling pretty good about it,

22:33.853 --> 22:35.888
if I'm being honest.

22:35.922 --> 22:39.091
Shaping young minds.
So, since, uh, I missed

22:39.125 --> 22:41.060
the morning briefing,
I wanted to get back

22:41.093 --> 22:43.095
to normal business
as soon as possible.

22:43.129 --> 22:46.599
So, as you all may have noticed,
the bullpen has been

22:46.633 --> 22:49.068
a bit short-staffed since
Mrs. Donovan retired.

22:49.101 --> 22:52.839
So, um, fortunately that
has all been addressed.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.974
We have a new member
of our support team,

22:55.007 --> 22:57.844
and I believe some
of you already know her.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.512
Can you come out here, please?

22:59.546 --> 23:02.482
Finish that paperwork later.
So please welcome

23:02.515 --> 23:06.619
to the Firehouse 51 family
Hope Jacquinot.

23:06.653 --> 23:09.722
[applause]

23:09.756 --> 23:12.725
[dramatic music]

23:12.759 --> 23:16.028
*

23:22.068 --> 23:22.401
.

23:22.435 --> 23:22.635
- Hey.

23:24.203 --> 23:26.172
- Hope, what's going on?

23:26.205 --> 23:27.840
- I'm sure you're a little
freaked I didn't tell you

23:27.874 --> 23:30.076
I was applying for the job,
but the thing is,

23:30.109 --> 23:32.111
I knew that if I did,
you'd feel pressured

23:32.144 --> 23:34.046
to talk to Chief Boden for me,
and I didn't want

23:34.080 --> 23:36.015
to do that to you.
I figured that,

23:36.048 --> 23:37.817
I'll get this job
on my own merits,

23:37.850 --> 23:39.819
or I don't deserve it.

23:39.852 --> 23:42.522
- I didn't even know that
you were looking in Chicago.

23:42.555 --> 23:44.123
- I wasn't.

23:44.156 --> 23:46.793
These last three weeks,
they've been amazing.

23:46.826 --> 23:49.195
I mean, I see you,
and I'm just so impressed

23:49.228 --> 23:51.598
and blown away.
Anyway, I was up here

23:51.631 --> 23:54.066
and I saw the job posting
on the bulletin board,

23:54.100 --> 23:57.203
and I thought,
"Why the hell not, Hope?

23:57.236 --> 24:00.172
What's stopping you?
Fowlerton?"

24:00.206 --> 24:02.208
Ugh.

24:02.241 --> 24:04.811
- I just--I wish
you had told me.

24:04.844 --> 24:07.246
- Well, now I do, too.

24:07.279 --> 24:09.616
But I really thought that
I was being a good friend

24:09.649 --> 24:15.221
by leaving you out of it.
And I was hoping

24:15.254 --> 24:19.992
that you'd be happy
if I got the job.

24:20.026 --> 24:22.228
- I am.
I-I really am.

24:22.261 --> 24:23.963
- Oh, my God.
Thank you.

24:23.996 --> 24:27.634
[laughs]
You're the best, Sylvie.

24:27.667 --> 24:30.603
I mean that.

24:30.637 --> 24:32.739
Okay.

24:32.772 --> 24:35.742
[dramatic music]

24:35.775 --> 24:42.815
*

24:44.917 --> 24:46.719
- [chuckles]
- Don't.

24:46.753 --> 24:49.021
- Well, it seems we've got
a little breakdown

24:49.055 --> 24:50.823
at the air traffic
control tower.

24:50.857 --> 24:52.124
- No, I mean it.
I'm serious.

24:52.158 --> 24:53.993
- A little crash
on the runway action.

24:54.026 --> 24:55.995
Just planes knocking
into each other.

24:56.028 --> 25:01.500
Ooh, it's rough.
Wreckage everywhere.

25:02.635 --> 25:04.537
Everywhere!

25:07.039 --> 25:09.842
- Life classes--
okay, bye.

25:09.876 --> 25:12.812
- Hey, so, uh,
what do you know

25:12.845 --> 25:14.146
about this Hope chick?

25:14.180 --> 25:16.683
- Seems, um,
well, I don't know.

25:16.716 --> 25:18.651
I've spent all
of five minutes with her.

25:18.685 --> 25:20.186
What's Brett saying?
- She's--

25:20.219 --> 25:22.789
- She's what?
- Supposed to be great.

25:26.025 --> 25:27.594
Oh, do you need to--
- Yeah.

25:27.627 --> 25:29.762
- Okay.

25:31.230 --> 25:34.166
- I need to get all of your
current incident reports.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.302
- I don't turn those in
until the 31st.

25:36.335 --> 25:38.337
- Chief Mullins' office
requested them

25:38.370 --> 25:42.341
along with your personnel file.
- What?

25:42.374 --> 25:44.744
- I just do what I'm told.

25:44.777 --> 25:47.680
[dramatic music]

25:47.714 --> 25:48.848
*

25:48.881 --> 25:50.249
- [groans]

25:50.282 --> 25:57.657
*

25:57.890 --> 25:59.626
[ringing]

25:59.659 --> 26:02.061
- Hey, what's up, buddy?
You seem stressed.

26:02.094 --> 26:03.596
- Do I?

26:03.630 --> 26:05.297
Twice now I've reached
out to Leon,

26:05.331 --> 26:06.799
and it's gone straight
to voicemail.

26:06.833 --> 26:08.367
He's declining my calls.

26:08.400 --> 26:11.237
- Why would he do that?
- I don't know, Otis.

26:11.270 --> 26:12.939
But something's not right.
I know it.

26:12.972 --> 26:15.241
- Well, he's probably
just got bad reception.

26:15.274 --> 26:18.210
I read a study that
a lot of carriers do that.

26:18.244 --> 26:21.347
Send a call to voicemail
when the reception's bad.

26:21.380 --> 26:25.117
- They did a study on that?
- Ah, well, yeah.

26:25.151 --> 26:27.654
- Yeah, yeah.

26:32.058 --> 26:34.160
- Come on,
he bought it.

26:35.862 --> 26:37.630
- Hello?

26:37.664 --> 26:39.298
- Hi, yes.
Can, uh--

26:39.331 --> 26:41.333
Can I help you?

26:41.367 --> 26:44.303
- Uh, I was told the people who
helped my brother work here.

26:44.336 --> 26:46.973
- Who?
- Dan Harris.

26:47.006 --> 26:51.243
He was...
He was on a roof today.

26:51.277 --> 26:54.046
- Rachel?
- Yeah.

26:54.080 --> 26:57.249
- Yeah, he, uh...
He talked about you.

26:57.283 --> 26:59.652
- He did?
- Yeah.

26:59.686 --> 27:01.954
Come on in.

27:01.988 --> 27:04.223
- How is he?
- Sedated.

27:04.256 --> 27:07.226
They did an MRI on his back.

27:08.160 --> 27:09.428
- He took a pretty hard hit.

27:09.461 --> 27:13.966
- I'm--I'm just so happy
that he's alive.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.368
*

27:16.402 --> 27:18.738
- Um, have a seat.

27:18.771 --> 27:22.408
*

27:22.441 --> 27:26.879
- It's not that we didn't know
that he had problems.

27:26.913 --> 27:33.052
He--He saw a therapist before,
but he stopped going.

27:33.085 --> 27:36.122
He stopped taking
his medication.

27:36.155 --> 27:40.192
"Maybe he's better,"
I told myself.

27:40.226 --> 27:42.428
Magically better.

27:44.130 --> 27:47.099
- Well, best thing now is you
can get him back into it.

27:47.133 --> 27:52.238
*

27:52.271 --> 27:54.040
- This was found
at the hospital.

27:54.073 --> 27:55.908
*

27:55.942 --> 27:59.879
My baby brother was on a roof
today with a will in his pocket.

28:05.184 --> 28:06.919
If it wasn't for you,
I would be planning

28:06.953 --> 28:09.021
a funeral right now.
But instead we're

28:09.055 --> 28:10.790
figuring out treatment.

28:10.823 --> 28:14.160
*

28:14.193 --> 28:19.065
I wanted to take
a moment and thank you.

28:19.098 --> 28:21.467
Thank you all.
It's probably just

28:21.500 --> 28:24.804
another alarm bell to you,
but to some of us,

28:24.837 --> 28:27.106
what you do for us
is the whole world.

28:27.139 --> 28:31.944
- Yeah, we're grateful
you're there for him.

28:31.978 --> 28:34.213
Keep him healthy.

28:34.246 --> 28:37.817
- I will.

28:37.850 --> 28:44.891
*

28:49.896 --> 28:51.030
- [grunts]

28:51.063 --> 28:53.800
Okay, come on.
Nope.

28:53.833 --> 28:55.501
You little bastard.
- I've been thinking.

28:55.534 --> 28:57.503
- Joe.
Yeah?

28:57.536 --> 29:01.874
- All this talk of Leon,
maybe I should reach out

29:01.908 --> 29:05.845
to the Insane Kings.
See if things have blown over.

29:05.878 --> 29:07.914
- Yeah, you know, Joe,
they have, uh,

29:07.947 --> 29:10.082
they have the word "insane"
right there in the title.

29:10.116 --> 29:11.283
So I--You know, I wouldn't--

29:11.317 --> 29:13.052
- Come with me.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.822
Strength in numbers.
I would feel so much better

29:15.855 --> 29:18.757
if I had backup.

29:20.459 --> 29:23.830
- Okay.
- Thanks, brother.

29:27.366 --> 29:28.868
- [sighs]
- Oh, wow.

29:28.901 --> 29:31.270
Don't ever do that.
- Abort, okay?

29:31.303 --> 29:33.539
Abort.
- We're on the two yard line.

29:33.572 --> 29:35.908
- He wants to go
to gang corners, okay?

29:35.942 --> 29:38.344
And ask around about Leon.
- Aww.

29:38.377 --> 29:39.979
- No, not "Aww."
It's not a good idea.

29:40.012 --> 29:42.481
- We'll get him to Molly's
before he can travel

29:42.514 --> 29:45.051
to gang corners.
- I got cold feet, Mouch.

29:45.084 --> 29:48.420
Scared, cold feet.
- Keep it together.

29:48.454 --> 29:50.957
- Be strong, man.

29:50.990 --> 29:54.160
*

29:54.193 --> 29:56.362
- Lieutenant Casey.
- Yeah?

29:56.395 --> 29:58.164
- Chief Boden would like
to see you.

29:58.197 --> 30:00.399
You, too, Dawson.

30:06.338 --> 30:08.507
- Lieutenant.

30:11.277 --> 30:12.945
- Chief.
- Anything you wanna tell me

30:12.979 --> 30:15.181
about a jumper call
while I was out?

30:15.214 --> 30:18.184
[dramatic music]

30:18.217 --> 30:22.354
*

30:26.025 --> 30:26.192
.

30:26.225 --> 30:26.993
- Chief, it was a
complicated situation.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.963
But I stand by my decision
and my team.

30:30.997 --> 30:32.865
- Lieutenant, I came to 51
knowing

30:32.899 --> 30:35.634
this house has a reputation
for doing things its own way.

30:35.667 --> 30:39.138
And I know Chief Boden has
a sharp eye for leadership,

30:39.171 --> 30:41.040
but let me tell you something,
Lieutenant.

30:41.073 --> 30:43.375
That rope rescue was like
nothing I've ever seen.

30:43.409 --> 30:46.478
No other firefighter I know
would have risked it.

30:46.512 --> 30:49.882
But if any other truck had
responded to that call,

30:49.916 --> 30:52.118
that young man would be
dead right now.

30:52.151 --> 30:55.421
You put the victim first.
Even after you knew

30:55.454 --> 30:57.924
I was on scene.
And you knew you were already

30:57.957 --> 31:00.359
on my hit list.

31:00.392 --> 31:03.996
You put his life ahead
of your career.

31:04.030 --> 31:08.334
*

31:08.367 --> 31:10.269
- All of Truck 81 did.

31:10.302 --> 31:13.005
*

31:13.039 --> 31:15.908
- Spoken like a true leader.

31:15.942 --> 31:18.978
Which is why I've recommended
you for a meritorious promotion.

31:19.011 --> 31:26.185
*

31:27.119 --> 31:30.156
- I don't know what to say.

31:30.189 --> 31:31.690
- You don't have
to say anything.

31:31.723 --> 31:33.692
You earned this, Matt.

31:33.725 --> 31:38.430
Not just on this call,
but every shift and every bell.

31:38.464 --> 31:41.700
Look, it's not gonna be official
until the ceremony,

31:41.733 --> 31:43.669
but let me be
the first to tell you.

31:43.702 --> 31:46.372
Congratulations,
Captain Casey.

31:46.405 --> 31:49.675
*

31:49.708 --> 31:51.510
- Thanks, Chief.
I'll do my best

31:51.543 --> 31:52.979
to make you proud.

31:53.012 --> 31:54.713
- I know you will.
Go get them.

31:54.746 --> 31:57.616
- [chuckles]

31:57.649 --> 32:01.520
*

32:01.553 --> 32:04.991
- Chief, thank you.

32:05.024 --> 32:07.193
*

32:07.226 --> 32:08.727
- All right,
so look for anything

32:08.760 --> 32:11.597
that's obviously out of date.
Use your discretion.

32:11.630 --> 32:14.266
- Okay, I can do that.
- I mean, if Capp hasn't

32:14.300 --> 32:16.402
sold this ab lounger by now--

32:16.435 --> 32:17.469
- [laughs]

32:18.537 --> 32:20.739
- Technically, it's not part
of the job description,

32:20.772 --> 32:22.274
but the Chief does not
like clutter.

32:22.308 --> 32:25.511
- Got it.
Any other tips I should know?

32:27.113 --> 32:29.148
Things to look out for?
Chief Boden?

32:29.181 --> 32:32.051
- Don't turn this Firehouse
into "Melrose Place."

32:32.084 --> 32:33.419
You'll do just fine.

32:33.452 --> 32:36.422
[dramatic music]

32:36.455 --> 32:42.028
*

32:42.061 --> 32:44.430
- Hey.

32:44.463 --> 32:45.664
You got a minute?

32:45.697 --> 32:49.101
- Sure.

32:49.135 --> 32:50.569
- Just so you know,
I think it's better

32:50.602 --> 32:56.208
if we leave what happened
as what happened.

32:56.242 --> 33:01.113
- Oh, okay, yeah.
- I mean, you're great.

33:01.147 --> 33:03.249
And I had a really
good time last night.

33:03.282 --> 33:05.651
But now that I'm working here,
I just don't want it

33:05.684 --> 33:08.454
to be a thing.
You know?

33:08.487 --> 33:10.389
- Yeah, no.
That makes total sense.

33:10.422 --> 33:12.391
- I just want to make
a good impression,

33:12.424 --> 33:16.262
and I get a feeling that Connie
has eyes on everything.

33:16.295 --> 33:19.565
- Yeah, I'm sure she does.
- So, we're cool?

33:19.598 --> 33:21.533
- Uh, yeah.
Absolutely.

33:21.567 --> 33:23.502
- [laughs]
Great.

33:23.535 --> 33:30.342
*

33:30.376 --> 33:32.111
- Okay, Otis.
Let's beat the bushes.

33:32.144 --> 33:34.413
- Oh, yeah.
Um--

33:34.446 --> 33:36.382
I actually have
to cover Molly's tonight.

33:36.415 --> 33:39.651
But--But,
uh, we can go after shift.

33:39.685 --> 33:42.288
At, like, two in the morning,
when all the finest

33:42.321 --> 33:44.556
gang members are out there.
- That's a good point.

33:44.590 --> 33:47.159
- Hey, Joe,
you know what you need?

33:47.193 --> 33:49.061
A good old-fashioned night

33:49.095 --> 33:51.163
of sucking the apple
from the barrel.

33:51.197 --> 33:53.332
- What?
- That is not a thing.

33:53.365 --> 33:55.701
- Sure it is.
It means tying one on.

33:55.734 --> 33:57.403
At Molly's, tonight.

33:57.436 --> 34:00.339
- That is a thing.
- Otis has to work anyway,

34:00.372 --> 34:03.209
and our Lieutenant got promoted.
That, my friends,

34:03.242 --> 34:04.710
is a cause for celebration.

34:04.743 --> 34:07.679
And Herrmann and Otis
have generously offered

34:07.713 --> 34:09.281
a buy one get one free.

34:09.315 --> 34:11.717
- Oh.
- Eh, wrong, no.

34:11.750 --> 34:14.686
Buy one, get one.
No free.

34:14.720 --> 34:16.388
- Still.

34:16.422 --> 34:19.258
- Okay, okay.
But after shift,

34:19.291 --> 34:20.759
we go gang hunting.

34:20.792 --> 34:23.195
- After shift, absolutely.

34:25.897 --> 34:28.467
- I wasn't even worried.
- Really?

34:28.500 --> 34:30.702
'Cause I thought I was gonna be
working airport duty

34:30.736 --> 34:32.771
for the next ten years.
- I'd do something like that,

34:32.804 --> 34:36.542
I'd end up in jail.
With you, it's "meritorious."

34:36.575 --> 34:38.844
- Hey, hey, why don't
you meritoriously

34:38.877 --> 34:40.312
go and get us some more beers?

34:40.346 --> 34:42.748
[rock music playing]

34:42.781 --> 34:43.815
- Aye aye, Captain.

34:43.849 --> 34:46.685
[laughs]

34:46.718 --> 34:47.886
*

34:47.919 --> 34:49.755
Three?

34:49.788 --> 34:50.756
- Ah.

34:50.789 --> 34:55.694
*

34:55.727 --> 35:01.867
Did you need one more?
For, uh, Hope over there?

35:01.900 --> 35:04.370
- Nah, we're cool.
We talked.

35:04.403 --> 35:06.138
- Mmm-hmm.
- She didn't want

35:06.172 --> 35:07.373
to make it a thing.
- Oh, when they say

35:07.406 --> 35:09.175
they don't wanna
make it a thing,

35:09.208 --> 35:12.811
it's already a thing.
- You're paranoid.

35:12.844 --> 35:14.313
- I'm para-right.

35:14.346 --> 35:16.782
[cell phone jingles]
You'll see.

35:16.815 --> 35:18.650
*

35:18.684 --> 35:20.519
Oh, hey!
[whistles]

35:20.552 --> 35:22.721
I just got
the signal from Mouch.

35:22.754 --> 35:24.723
Incoming.
Incoming.

35:24.756 --> 35:27.259
all: [cheers]
- Guys!

35:27.293 --> 35:29.495
- Let's go.
Let's go.

35:29.528 --> 35:31.163
- I'm going.

35:32.664 --> 35:33.865
- You know what, you guys,
I can't do this.

35:33.899 --> 35:35.167
I'm just gonna go home.

35:35.201 --> 35:36.535
- Oh.
- What? No.

35:36.568 --> 35:38.370
Celebrating, remember?
- I'm just not

35:38.404 --> 35:39.938
in the mood for people.
- You know what's good

35:39.971 --> 35:41.373
when you're not
in the mood for people?

35:41.407 --> 35:42.941
Beer.
- I have beer at home.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.476
- One drink.
You wanna support Casey,

35:44.510 --> 35:46.178
don't you?
- I'm gonna see Casey

35:46.212 --> 35:47.546
every shift for
the rest of my life.

35:47.579 --> 35:49.315
I can support him later.
- Come on, Joe.

35:49.348 --> 35:50.916
What kind of
an attitude is that?

35:50.949 --> 35:54.320
- Exactly. I'm just gonna
bring everybody down.

35:54.353 --> 35:56.955
- You know, you know,
now that I think about it,

35:56.988 --> 35:59.458
We should do that
buy one get one free.

35:59.491 --> 36:00.526
- Oh.

36:02.461 --> 36:04.263
- Fine.
One drink.

36:04.296 --> 36:06.565
- Attaboy.
- [sighs]

36:06.598 --> 36:07.833
- Just one, though.
- I swear.

36:07.866 --> 36:09.368
I promise.
I know.

36:09.401 --> 36:10.536
- I don't wanna be
here all night.

36:10.569 --> 36:12.971
[cheering]

36:13.004 --> 36:16.675
- Happy birthday, bro!

36:22.548 --> 36:25.384
- Surprise!
- Happy birthday!

36:25.417 --> 36:27.353
- You were surprised, right?
- Are you kidding me?

36:27.386 --> 36:29.321
I've been so spun out
about this whole Leon thing

36:29.355 --> 36:31.223
I completely forgot
it was my birthday.

36:31.257 --> 36:32.558
[laughter]

36:32.591 --> 36:34.526
Thank you, guys.
- Don't thank us yet,

36:34.560 --> 36:36.728
because here's an
even bigger surprise.

36:36.762 --> 36:40.866
Funny you should mention Leon,
because here he is.

36:40.899 --> 36:42.768
- What?
[party horn wails]

36:48.507 --> 36:52.878
- I said, regarding Leon,
here he is.

36:52.911 --> 36:54.780
[cheers]

36:58.284 --> 36:59.451
- Is this supposed to be
some sort of joke?

36:59.485 --> 37:00.919
- What? No.
He's--he's here.

37:00.952 --> 37:02.988
- Right.
- No, no, he really is.

37:03.021 --> 37:05.624
- No, Mouch brought him here.
- Yeah, and Otis helped him.

37:05.657 --> 37:07.326
-Okay, just stop, guys,
all right?

37:07.359 --> 37:08.460
I don't know what
game you're pulling.

37:08.494 --> 37:11.363
- I swear, he was just here.

37:11.397 --> 37:14.032
- Mouch, what did you do?
- I--I--I'll--

37:14.065 --> 37:16.835
- Wait, I know what you did.

37:16.868 --> 37:18.437
- You do?
- Mmm-hmm.

37:18.470 --> 37:22.908
Because Leon is
right over there.

37:22.941 --> 37:26.312
- Ha ha!
[cheers]

37:28.880 --> 37:31.850
[laughs]

37:31.883 --> 37:33.319
- I don't understand.

37:33.352 --> 37:34.520
- You can't beat
the Cruz brothers.

37:34.553 --> 37:36.522
It can't be done.
Can't do it.

37:36.555 --> 37:38.690
- How long have you known?
- Since I was at the Firehouse.

37:38.724 --> 37:40.659
He told me he figured it out,
and we were gonna spin it

37:40.692 --> 37:42.928
back on you.
- Oh, he did, huh?

37:42.961 --> 37:44.796
- Ah, and that whole thing about
you wanting me to go with you

37:44.830 --> 37:47.399
and meet those gang members?
- That's what you get

37:47.433 --> 37:51.069
for helping Mouch.
- Oh, thank God.

37:51.102 --> 37:53.905
- Seriously, Mouch.
This is amazing.

37:53.939 --> 37:56.742
I really appreciate it.
- Hey, the way you

37:56.775 --> 37:58.644
took care of me
after my heart attack,

37:58.677 --> 38:01.813
I'll never forget that.
Least I could do.

38:03.582 --> 38:06.952
- Hey, everybody.
Buy one get one free

38:06.985 --> 38:08.687
all night long.
[cheering]

38:08.720 --> 38:12.991
- Aw, come on!
I saved you from a heart attack!

38:13.024 --> 38:14.693
- Get over here.
Get over here.

38:14.726 --> 38:19.365
- Aww.
Happy birthday, buddy.

38:22.534 --> 38:25.704
- Sylvie.
- Hey, Connie.

38:27.673 --> 38:29.608
- What?
- I just got a call

38:29.641 --> 38:32.110
from Fowlerton.
- Uh, what do you mean?

38:32.143 --> 38:34.446
- Did you know that
your friend Hope

38:34.480 --> 38:37.048
stole 10 grand
from her last boss?

38:37.082 --> 38:40.051
[tense music]

38:40.085 --> 38:45.824
