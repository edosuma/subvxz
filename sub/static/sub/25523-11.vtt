WEBVTT

00:20.729 --> 00:23.565
SATURDAY, JULY 11TH, 2015

00:43.877 --> 00:45.754
Sir, you have a call.

00:50.216 --> 00:51.176
Hello?

00:55.430 --> 00:56.389
Understood.

00:58.349 --> 00:59.642
Do we have the situation
under control?

01:00.977 --> 01:01.853
Negative.

01:02.645 --> 01:03.897
We've lost him.

01:04.522 --> 01:06.107
We don't know where he's headed.

01:09.235 --> 01:10.987
Follow the security protocols,

01:11.821 --> 01:12.697
and first thing tomorrow morning

01:12.781 --> 01:14.407
I want you to give
the necessary announcements.

01:35.970 --> 01:36.888
Mr. President...

01:38.348 --> 01:39.557
a moment, please.

01:45.355 --> 01:46.689
What happened?

01:50.360 --> 01:51.361
El Chapo got away.

01:53.738 --> 01:55.240
Through a tunnel, apparently.

02:05.458 --> 02:06.918
How can that be, Conrado?

02:07.043 --> 02:08.753
How can anybody escape from Altiplano?

02:10.421 --> 02:11.589
They're already investigating.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.426
I'll keep you posted
with any developments.

02:17.095 --> 02:18.221
Be sure that

02:19.013 --> 02:20.598
all responsible for this will pay.

02:21.474 --> 02:23.226
This will hit us hard.

02:24.561 --> 02:25.979
What are we going to do
about France?

02:27.147 --> 02:29.357
It's an official visit,
you can't cancel it.

02:31.109 --> 02:32.485
I'll return to Mexico immediately.

02:32.610 --> 02:34.362
I'll handle and coordinate everything.

02:34.779 --> 02:35.864
Find him, Conrado.

02:36.489 --> 02:37.657
Get him back in jail.

02:41.411 --> 02:42.620
You have my word, sir.

02:57.302 --> 03:01.431
I feel the warmth
from my boiling blood

03:01.764 --> 03:05.977
I feel the fear sweat dripping away

03:06.060 --> 03:10.231
There's a stillness
that nothing transmits

03:10.690 --> 03:15.862
I'm a breeze that grows stronger

03:17.447 --> 03:20.491
Even when the clouds drift away

03:21.659 --> 03:24.996
Even when my skin dries away

03:25.747 --> 03:29.250
I'll be back someday

03:30.293 --> 03:34.172
To unleash my return

03:39.052 --> 03:42.555
I have the dust
that protects the road

03:43.056 --> 03:47.602
I have the branches
of a leafless tree

03:47.727 --> 03:51.606
I'm the guardian of the tired night

03:52.232 --> 03:57.570
There are silhouettes
that come to meet me

03:58.988 --> 04:01.991
Even when the clouds drift away

04:03.159 --> 04:06.454
Even when my skin dries away

04:07.330 --> 04:10.917
I'll be back someday

04:11.834 --> 04:16.047
To unleash my return

04:19.801 --> 04:21.219
Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman,

04:21.302 --> 04:22.553
leader of the Sinaloa cartel,

04:22.679 --> 04:24.055
has escaped for a second time

04:24.180 --> 04:26.474
from a maximum security prison
in our country.

04:26.557 --> 04:27.809
Joaquin Guzman Loera,

04:27.934 --> 04:29.936
the world's biggest drug dealer,

04:30.103 --> 04:33.231
-has escaped...
-...from a maximum security prison.

04:33.314 --> 04:35.566
He's considered one of the most powerful

04:35.692 --> 04:37.485
drug lords in the world,

04:37.694 --> 04:38.861
and he's escaped prison.

04:38.987 --> 04:41.197
The search operations to re-capture him

04:41.322 --> 04:43.616
have strengthened and extended

04:43.741 --> 04:45.368
throughout the entire country.

04:45.493 --> 04:46.452
Yesterday...

04:46.619 --> 04:47.495
NATIONAL SECURITY COMMISSION
MEXICO CITY

04:47.578 --> 04:49.747
...at Federal Social Readaptation Center

04:49.872 --> 04:50.999
No. 1, Altiplano,

04:53.042 --> 04:55.336
Joaquin Guzman Loera escaped.

04:58.172 --> 05:00.216
Around 8:52 p.m.,

05:00.967 --> 05:04.595
after noticing his absence
via security cameras,

05:05.346 --> 05:07.724
the prison staff went to his cell
to check on him,

05:09.767 --> 05:10.852
and they found the entrance of a tunnel.

05:11.227 --> 05:13.563
El Chapo escaped using a tunnel

05:13.688 --> 05:15.231
that opened up inside his shower stall.

05:15.481 --> 05:17.942
It was 550 feet high

05:18.067 --> 05:19.777
and 31 inches wide,

05:20.403 --> 05:23.323
and more than 4,900 feet long.

05:23.489 --> 05:24.991
The tunnel ends at a property

05:25.450 --> 05:27.827
that is located in the Santa Juanita.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.871
In that property there was furniture,

05:30.371 --> 05:31.497
as well as equipment

05:32.582 --> 05:33.958
and other objects

05:34.125 --> 05:36.210
that show there were
some workers living there.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.337
A security operative
was deployed

05:38.463 --> 05:40.840
around Altiplano prison

05:40.965 --> 05:42.050
in the state of Mexico,

05:42.467 --> 05:46.054
as well as highways
in adjacent institutions.

05:52.268 --> 05:54.520
PRESIDENTIAL SUITE
PARIS, FRANCE

05:55.646 --> 05:56.481
Hello?

05:59.817 --> 06:01.235
I've already given out instructions

06:01.360 --> 06:02.445
to my government secretary

06:02.570 --> 06:03.863
so he can begin a thorough investigation.

06:04.113 --> 06:05.198
He's back in Mexico and...

06:06.491 --> 06:07.825
soon he'll have answers for us.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.460
This time it will be different,

06:17.668 --> 06:18.586
you have my word.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.797
As soon as we catch him,
he'll be extradited.

06:29.764 --> 06:31.390
What happened
proves there's corruption

06:31.474 --> 06:32.600
in the highest ranks,

06:32.683 --> 06:33.976
and also, the government's inability

06:34.102 --> 06:35.770
to deal with organized crime.

06:36.187 --> 06:37.980
How is it possible that there was a tunnel

06:38.106 --> 06:39.982
built inside a maximum security prison

06:40.191 --> 06:41.859
without anybody noticing?

06:42.318 --> 06:44.737
What kind of internal
and external support

06:44.821 --> 06:45.947
does El Chapo Guzman count on?

06:46.072 --> 06:47.490
-We're screwed.
-This outrageous fact,

06:47.573 --> 06:50.243
is a direct humiliation
for Esteban Prieto...

06:50.368 --> 06:51.494
Did Conrado already land?

06:51.619 --> 06:53.830
...whose approval rate
has been the lowest in history,

06:54.163 --> 06:56.582
following the disappearance of 43 students

06:56.707 --> 06:57.834
in Ayotzinapa,

06:58.292 --> 07:00.962
and the scandal regarding
his wife's real estate holdings.

07:04.966 --> 07:07.593
ARE YOU IN MEXICO?

07:07.677 --> 07:10.721
I JUST LANDED. WE'LL TALK TONIGHT.

07:10.930 --> 07:13.266
...might be impossible
to turn around for him.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.308
Nonetheless,

07:14.434 --> 07:17.186
even though his administration
is going through a serious crisis,

07:17.353 --> 07:20.440
the President decided
to continue his trip to France.

07:26.362 --> 07:28.698
NATIONAL SECURITY AND
INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT, MEXICO CITY

07:32.827 --> 07:34.454
General, is everything running?

07:34.620 --> 07:35.830
Yes, Mr. Secretary.

07:35.997 --> 07:37.623
All the security protocols
have been activated.

07:37.999 --> 07:40.418
There have been search operations
around the entire country,

07:40.835 --> 07:43.087
but most of all in Culiacan
and the Golden Triangle.

07:43.421 --> 07:45.548
Let's monitor all the entrances
and exits from La Tuna.

07:46.174 --> 07:49.218
In the next hours, we should be able
to pinpoint Guzman's exact location

07:49.844 --> 07:51.220
and make the first arrest.

07:52.847 --> 07:55.308
I came as fast as I could.
What do you need?

07:55.683 --> 07:57.310
They're coming for me any minute now.

07:57.685 --> 07:59.520
It was part of Joaquin's arrangement.

07:59.979 --> 08:02.190
I didn't tell you before
to not get you involved.

08:03.024 --> 08:04.358
Did you come to any arrangements?

08:04.525 --> 08:05.568
The best ones.

08:07.361 --> 08:09.989
I need you to handle everything
that comes next.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.991
They'll be contacting you soon.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.576
The clock is running,

08:13.743 --> 08:15.703
and even though the search
has been extended

08:15.953 --> 08:17.246
throughout most of the country,

08:17.872 --> 08:21.709
there's no news about
El Chapo Guzman's location...

08:22.126 --> 08:23.836
You need to search his main territories.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.714
I want you to find out which
government officials answer to him.

08:28.007 --> 08:29.550
We need to get to him before he's caught.

08:30.051 --> 08:30.927
Hurry.

08:34.430 --> 08:36.933
SECURITY CABIN
GOLDEN TRIANGLE

08:54.075 --> 08:55.409
El Chilo answered your call.

08:58.162 --> 08:59.372
It's so nice to see you, man.

08:59.705 --> 09:00.706
We're standing tall here, Mr. Joaquin.

09:00.790 --> 09:01.832
CHILO
GUAMUCHIL TURF BOSS

09:01.916 --> 09:03.084
Me and my people
are getting you out of the country.

09:03.251 --> 09:05.419
Not everyone is ready to leave
their squares as soon as I call.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.338
If I'm a turf boss
it's because of you, sir.

09:08.714 --> 09:09.715
Did Ismael call you?

09:09.799 --> 09:10.800
Yeah, he's on his way.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.722
ALTIPLANO PRISON
ALMOLOYA DE JUAREZ, MEXICO

10:16.824 --> 10:17.908
Where are the guards?

10:28.586 --> 10:29.670
How much do they know?

10:31.255 --> 10:32.548
They don't know anything
about the escape plan.

10:34.967 --> 10:37.136
As we discussed, we only told them
that the noise was coming

10:37.219 --> 10:38.971
from the construction site
on Cutzamala River.

10:42.933 --> 10:44.060
What about the DISE agents?

10:45.227 --> 10:46.228
They're in their area.

10:46.979 --> 10:48.898
Nobody was allowed out of the prison.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.233
-Are they still with us?
-Yes, sir

10:51.901 --> 10:54.195
They knew that as security heads,

10:54.362 --> 10:56.113
they'd be the first to be suspected.

11:01.911 --> 11:02.787
Bring them to the yard,

11:03.579 --> 11:05.623
but before that,
I need them to turn in all the videos.

11:09.418 --> 11:10.670
Also, delete any copies.

11:16.342 --> 11:18.344
All right, Martin, the moment is here.

11:19.053 --> 11:20.221
You'll be in prison for two years,

11:21.180 --> 11:23.224
but then you'll get out scot-free.

11:24.308 --> 11:25.601
Your family will be fine,

11:26.352 --> 11:28.604
they'll get a generous salary.

11:29.647 --> 11:31.982
I'll take care of them
and handle their security.

11:33.484 --> 11:34.485
Of course...

11:35.653 --> 11:37.321
as long as you don't betray me.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.740
Don't worry,

11:40.616 --> 11:41.700
I'll be true to my word.

11:59.427 --> 12:00.428
Conrado.

12:00.761 --> 12:03.973
Mr. President, we've finished
the prison inspection

12:04.056 --> 12:05.307
and interrogated the staff.

12:05.683 --> 12:07.977
Guzman Loera didn't need
any outside support.

12:08.060 --> 12:10.229
All the information
he needed for his escape

12:10.354 --> 12:12.982
was given to him by the director himself

12:13.607 --> 12:15.484
and the prison staff.

12:15.651 --> 12:17.361
Are you absolutely sure?

12:17.486 --> 12:18.612
I have no doubts, sir.

12:18.737 --> 12:21.490
The knowledge that the staff

12:21.991 --> 12:24.076
and security heads that handled
the surveillance cameras

12:24.201 --> 12:26.954
had of the building was enough
to help Guzman build that tunnel.

12:27.037 --> 12:28.456
What measures have you taken
up until now?

12:29.039 --> 12:32.293
I've ordered the arrest
of 34 people.

12:33.085 --> 12:34.879
Both staff members and officials.

12:35.087 --> 12:37.047
They'll be at the mercy
of the justice system.

12:37.715 --> 12:40.301
Their degrees of complicity
will be duly clarified.

12:40.759 --> 12:41.719
Also,

12:42.428 --> 12:44.972
I've relieved the prison director
of his duties

12:45.097 --> 12:47.892
and ordered his immediate arrest.

12:48.267 --> 12:50.811
If his participation in this event
is confirmed,

12:51.145 --> 12:53.731
it would be a case of corruption,

12:54.106 --> 12:55.858
disloyalty and treason

12:56.358 --> 12:58.486
to the Mexican people and state.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.113
To the press I say,

13:02.865 --> 13:04.992
as long as I'm in charge,

13:05.326 --> 13:06.994
there will be no place for impunity.

13:08.370 --> 13:11.499
Everyone responsible
for El Chapo's escape will fall.

13:12.583 --> 13:14.418
I've given precise instructions

13:14.543 --> 13:16.337
for the surveillance and capture

13:16.462 --> 13:18.923
of the people closest
to this drug trafficker.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.801
The search for Joaquin Guzman Loera
won't stop.

13:24.094 --> 13:26.222
There won't be rest for this criminal.

13:26.847 --> 13:29.058
And we will be able to catch him.

13:29.767 --> 13:31.852
That's my promise to you.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.209
Buddy.

13:55.960 --> 13:56.794
Buddy.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.714
Thank you for taking the risk
and coming all the way here.

14:01.590 --> 14:03.592
They're searching for you
across the entire country.

14:04.218 --> 14:05.219
When are you leaving?

14:05.427 --> 14:07.221
As soon as I finish what I need to do.

14:08.389 --> 14:09.682
Is Damaso on his way?

14:10.224 --> 14:11.684
He shouldn't be long.

14:12.977 --> 14:14.103
Joaquin...

14:15.604 --> 14:17.189
I wasn't able to get in touch
with your mother.

14:19.066 --> 14:20.609
Things are complicated.

14:22.611 --> 14:24.071
The government won the game this time,

14:24.989 --> 14:26.365
and they've got surveillance on all of us.

14:28.742 --> 14:30.119
But the plan is still in motion.

14:30.828 --> 14:32.955
We've sent someone trustworthy
to locate her.

14:50.514 --> 14:52.725
Go after a truck in La Tuna. Over.

15:08.532 --> 15:09.825
Mrs. Esperanza.

15:11.869 --> 15:12.703
Who are you?

15:13.370 --> 15:14.997
I've come here on Ismael's behalf.

15:15.164 --> 15:16.540
I'll take you to see your son.

15:27.051 --> 15:27.885
Damaso.

15:32.848 --> 15:33.849
Come in.

15:39.563 --> 15:40.981
We don't have time,
and I'm not interested

15:41.065 --> 15:42.232
in talking about the past.

15:43.817 --> 15:45.986
Before I leave for Colombia,
I wanted to get everything in order.

15:47.071 --> 15:49.615
Sinaloa has to be united
against enemies like Isidoro.

15:51.659 --> 15:53.410
Everyone has their own territory

15:53.494 --> 15:55.204
and can handle those as they see fit.

15:55.371 --> 15:57.831
But this problem
between you two has to end,

15:58.707 --> 16:01.293
or we'll end up dead and our families
with no business to operate.

16:02.544 --> 16:04.213
I'm not willing to lose another son...

16:05.756 --> 16:06.590
or another friend.

16:07.174 --> 16:09.343
You're fighting over something
that only exists in your heads.

16:09.927 --> 16:11.720
What made you think
that the power was in dispute?

16:12.513 --> 16:14.098
Here, the power is for everyone!

16:14.765 --> 16:15.724
We're all part of this organization!

16:16.100 --> 16:17.810
And only if we stick together,
we'll continue to be what we are.

16:21.730 --> 16:24.817
During my absence,
Ismael will administer my territories

16:26.360 --> 16:27.528
and will work my routes.

16:29.029 --> 16:30.239
If something were to happen to me,

16:31.198 --> 16:32.241
Quino, because he's my son,

16:33.534 --> 16:34.493
will be my successor.

16:37.579 --> 16:38.998
But he won't get it all.

16:40.457 --> 16:43.544
Damaso will have a part
of my territories for his loyalty.

16:45.212 --> 16:46.714
That distribution will be done by Ismael,

16:47.089 --> 16:48.215
and you will respect it.

16:50.509 --> 16:51.969
No more fighting. Is that clear?

17:03.981 --> 17:04.815
Will it take much longer?

17:05.357 --> 17:06.525
No, we're almost there.

17:39.141 --> 17:40.184
What are we going to do?

17:40.726 --> 17:42.978
Don't worry. Just follow me.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.367
Confirming. His mother is here.

17:57.618 --> 17:59.620
Copy that. Let's close the perimeter.

18:06.752 --> 18:07.669
Hurry up!

18:18.430 --> 18:19.264
Anything?

18:20.682 --> 18:22.101
We should leave soon.

18:22.684 --> 18:24.436
It's getting late and the road is long.

18:24.812 --> 18:27.106
The army might comb this area
any minute now.

18:27.689 --> 18:28.565
No, son.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.692
I can't leave
without seeing your grandma.

18:32.027 --> 18:34.238
You can leave
and make sure everything is ready

18:34.363 --> 18:35.948
to welcome Elba and the girls.

18:36.907 --> 18:37.741
Let's go.

18:40.160 --> 18:41.120
Go pick them up.

18:42.162 --> 18:43.831
As soon as I say goodbye to my mother,

18:43.997 --> 18:45.332
I'll leave for the ranch.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.919
-We'll see each other there.
-Done, Joaquin.

18:49.461 --> 18:50.337
Hector.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.341
Take all the precautions I explained.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.553
The government will want
to use them as bait.

18:58.262 --> 18:59.930
Take alternate routes.

19:00.764 --> 19:02.349
That's the only way you
will be able to shake them off.

19:02.808 --> 19:03.934
Don't worry.

19:04.351 --> 19:06.478
We'll use the roads
that only we know about.

19:06.603 --> 19:08.689
If in any moment you feel
you're in danger, turn back.

19:09.523 --> 19:11.608
Don't risk my girls
for anything in the world.

19:12.401 --> 19:13.360
I promise.

19:37.092 --> 19:39.219
They shouldn't have left
at the same time, man.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.849
The less movement seen
around here, the better.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.310
That might be,
but time is running out for me,

19:46.435 --> 19:47.978
and I still have some things to resolve.

19:48.645 --> 19:50.439
As a matter of fact,
I need your help in another matter.

19:51.106 --> 19:52.983
Valdovinos is out of the game,

19:53.108 --> 19:55.194
but we've got his partner, Garduño.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.614
I need you to call him and tell him
I want to talk about the movie project.

20:00.407 --> 20:01.450
What movie?

20:02.534 --> 20:04.453
A movie so people won't ever forget me.

20:05.996 --> 20:07.331
He'll know what I'm talking about.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.708
Tell him I want to meet with our contact.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.129
MEXICO CITY

20:14.254 --> 20:16.840
Chapo's escape is a catastrophe.
Fucking Esteban.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.718
He brought disgrace not only on himself,
but on all of us as well.

20:19.801 --> 20:20.969
Esteban is a burden

20:21.470 --> 20:23.722
that we will have to carry,

20:24.598 --> 20:25.599
especially you.

20:26.600 --> 20:27.851
This will hit the government hard.

20:27.976 --> 20:29.228
Have you given any thought to resigning?

20:30.062 --> 20:30.938
No.

20:33.941 --> 20:35.734
You're far too calm, Conrado.

20:36.985 --> 20:38.111
What are you planning?

20:39.321 --> 20:41.323
Someone from the outside
helped Guzman to escape.

20:42.866 --> 20:45.994
The support he had inside the prison
never would've been enough.

20:47.496 --> 20:48.747
It's all lies.

20:51.583 --> 20:54.169
Someone gave him the plans
for that tunnel to be built,

20:55.212 --> 20:57.047
and protected him during that entire time.

20:58.757 --> 20:59.591
Who?

21:05.055 --> 21:07.724
Someone that's interested
in hitting the president's image so hard,

21:07.849 --> 21:09.935
it discredits him.

21:11.311 --> 21:12.604
Someone from the party

21:13.188 --> 21:15.315
that might be convinced
that Esteban's incompetence

21:15.983 --> 21:17.317
would lead them to disaster.

21:18.860 --> 21:19.695
A traitor?

21:20.988 --> 21:22.739
No, a savior.

21:23.824 --> 21:25.701
Someone that knew
he'd be able to handle the crisis

21:25.867 --> 21:27.619
and come out of it stronger...

21:29.162 --> 21:30.455
and as the perfect presidential candidate.

21:30.998 --> 21:31.832
You?

21:33.792 --> 21:34.668
Yes.

21:36.753 --> 21:38.046
I gave him the plans.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.216
And now, I'll go after him,

21:42.050 --> 21:44.011
-and when I catch him...
-You'll be a hero.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.180
And Esteban will keep being
an incompetent.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.849
But he'll still be the president,

21:49.224 --> 21:51.601
so he'll take advantage of this situation
to clean up his image.

21:51.810 --> 21:53.228
Berta.

21:53.520 --> 21:54.813
He's not even here.

21:55.105 --> 21:56.189
There's a power void.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.607
A void that you will fill?

22:00.819 --> 22:01.653
Brilliant.

22:02.779 --> 22:03.655
It's insane.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.116
Esteban Prieto was ruining us.

22:07.075 --> 22:08.118
We had to do something.

22:09.411 --> 22:11.580
But you have to catch
El Chapo and soon, Conrado.

22:11.872 --> 22:12.873
If you don't,

22:14.082 --> 22:16.793
-none of this will matter.
-This is insane, it's foolish.

22:17.711 --> 22:19.463
If he doesn't manage to catch him,
he'll sink us all.

22:19.588 --> 22:21.548
But if he catches him,
we'll be contenders in the race.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.430
-You didn't know anything about this?
-No!

22:29.723 --> 22:31.475
If I had known,
I would've never supported him.

22:35.228 --> 22:36.480
I support you.

22:37.355 --> 22:38.815
And I'll take the risk for you, Conrado.

22:41.359 --> 22:43.820
It's the best bet for us
to get back in the game.

23:14.768 --> 23:16.228
Why didn't you tell me about your plan?

23:18.355 --> 23:19.731
I couldn't share it with anybody.

23:20.107 --> 23:22.609
I looked like a fool
in front of my godfather.

23:24.402 --> 23:26.196
But whatever comes next,
it will benefit the three of us.

23:26.321 --> 23:27.322
From now on,

23:27.697 --> 23:30.242
you'll tell me all about
your brilliant ideas.

23:30.617 --> 23:33.245
You won't make any important choices
without consulting with me first.

23:34.788 --> 23:36.456
I will do anything, Conrado.

23:36.873 --> 23:38.625
Even exposing your secret.

23:39.334 --> 23:41.711
I don't care if I ruin
my godfather's plans.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.797
I don't care if everything goes to shit.

23:44.339 --> 23:46.800
I won't be the fool because of you,

23:47.092 --> 23:47.926
understood?

23:51.096 --> 23:51.930
Yes.

24:13.201 --> 24:14.077
Son,

24:14.953 --> 24:16.204
what is going to happen now?

24:17.789 --> 24:19.082
Nothing's going to happen, Mom.

24:20.250 --> 24:22.419
But I have to go where I won't be found.

24:23.920 --> 24:24.838
Where are you going?

24:27.757 --> 24:29.926
I'll go further in,
until I reach the coast

24:31.303 --> 24:32.304
and travel to Colombia.

24:37.893 --> 24:39.603
They know where to look for me here.

24:41.188 --> 24:42.731
Over there, they won't even know
where to start.

24:45.066 --> 24:46.985
But I couldn't leave without first
saying goodbye to you.

24:48.486 --> 24:49.863
When will I see you again?

24:52.699 --> 24:53.533
I'm not sure.

25:49.381 --> 25:50.799
JOAQUIN'S SAFE HOUSE
COSALA, MEXICO

25:50.966 --> 25:52.467
The rooms are ready,

25:53.718 --> 25:55.220
and the surveillance system is organized.

25:56.096 --> 25:57.472
Make sure there's food for the girls.

25:57.597 --> 25:58.932
My dad will be here any minute.

26:06.690 --> 26:09.317
I need you to investigate anything
you're able to find about my wife.

26:10.902 --> 26:13.321
-Anything in particular?
-Everything.

26:14.781 --> 26:17.367
I want to be able to know her
better than she knows herself.

26:18.618 --> 26:20.704
Understood, sir. Excuse me.

26:25.583 --> 26:28.962
INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY
DEPARTMENT MEXICO CITY

26:35.302 --> 26:36.136
Hello?

26:36.344 --> 26:37.345
Mr. Secretary,

26:37.595 --> 26:39.723
we have something on El Chapo
that might interest you,

26:40.598 --> 26:42.684
but we're going to need
some help from the gringos.

26:44.019 --> 26:44.978
There's not much time.

26:46.813 --> 26:48.106
I need you to look for someone for me.

26:49.190 --> 26:50.358
An actress.

26:52.027 --> 26:52.861
Vanessa Espinoza.

26:53.194 --> 26:55.238
I don't think
she lives in Mexico, Joaquin.

26:55.697 --> 26:57.449
As far as I know, she lives in the U.S.

26:57.574 --> 26:58.491
Look for her.

26:59.826 --> 27:01.953
I want her to put together a movie
about my life.

27:06.499 --> 27:07.751
I know that you've got
a lot of doubts

27:07.876 --> 27:10.170
about our intention
to extradite Guzman Loera.

27:10.879 --> 27:12.130
I shared this information with you

27:12.213 --> 27:14.215
to show you that
we have a common objective.

27:18.887 --> 27:20.680
I think the actress is a good lead.

27:27.562 --> 27:28.396
On the contrary,

27:29.731 --> 27:30.732
I know him.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.068
I think it's worth a shot.

27:33.860 --> 27:36.988
You can intervene with Vanessa Espinoza
in your own territory,

27:38.156 --> 27:39.115
and we can do the same here.

27:40.992 --> 27:42.994
We've arrested El Chapo's attorney

27:43.745 --> 27:45.246
and we've got surveillance
on all his family,

27:45.747 --> 27:47.707
but we haven't been able
to find anything of value.

27:48.833 --> 27:50.585
If he contacts that actress again,

27:51.461 --> 27:52.670
we have to be prepared.

28:03.098 --> 28:04.099
You have my word.

28:06.684 --> 28:07.852
Sir, it's me.

28:08.186 --> 28:10.355
Go ahead, sir, what is it?

28:11.231 --> 28:12.690
Joaquin has a task for you.

28:14.150 --> 28:16.736
He wants to take that movie project
he started with Valdovinos up again.

28:17.570 --> 28:19.739
-Are you up to speed?
-Yes, sir.

28:20.031 --> 28:21.366
We managed to contact...

28:22.492 --> 28:23.701
the actress.

28:24.994 --> 28:25.995
Vanessa Espinoza.

28:26.079 --> 28:27.747
Tell her Joaquin
wants to meet her.

28:27.997 --> 28:29.624
She's a public figure, sir.

28:30.083 --> 28:31.334
It would attract a lot of attention.

28:31.459 --> 28:33.044
If my partner already contacted her,

28:33.545 --> 28:35.088
she might be under surveillance.

28:36.047 --> 28:37.465
I think the same thing, but it's no use.

28:39.134 --> 28:41.344
It's a priority for Joaquin
to start this.

28:42.804 --> 28:44.097
And he's willing to take the risk.

28:45.765 --> 28:47.308
MEXICO CITY

29:08.496 --> 29:10.123
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

29:11.541 --> 29:12.792
I thought you weren't coming.

29:13.835 --> 29:15.837
With everything that's going on,
I thought I wouldn't be able to come.

29:18.256 --> 29:19.549
But things are back on track.

29:20.216 --> 29:23.344
We've got a new lead
in our pursuit of El Chapo.

29:23.928 --> 29:25.346
Also, Berta is being investigated.

29:27.265 --> 29:28.975
I've grown tired of her threats.

29:31.144 --> 29:32.979
I'm glad. It seems as if
you've got it under control.

29:33.354 --> 29:34.189
Almost.

29:35.064 --> 29:36.483
What I don't have much of, is time.

29:38.193 --> 29:39.569
I also have something to tell you.

29:43.198 --> 29:46.326
I was offered the vice-director position
in the NGO, at the Monterrey branch.

30:04.844 --> 30:05.970
You can't leave.

30:09.516 --> 30:11.351
If you leave,
it'll be even harder to see each other.

30:13.102 --> 30:14.354
I'm tired, Conrado.

30:15.146 --> 30:16.022
Don't leave.

30:19.317 --> 30:21.486
This is not enough,
none of this is enough.

30:21.611 --> 30:22.737
They're killing everything we have.

30:29.369 --> 30:30.745
Don't say that, Sebastian.

30:33.289 --> 30:34.499
Have a little patience.

30:37.418 --> 30:39.295
I know I've said this many times before,
but it's the truth.

30:40.046 --> 30:41.172
Things will change.

30:41.756 --> 30:42.715
When?

30:44.676 --> 30:45.844
I don't know when, but...

30:47.178 --> 30:48.471
I know that this,

30:49.806 --> 30:52.183
even though it's not much, is better
than not having you in my life.

30:56.104 --> 30:57.230
Isn't it the same for you?

30:59.107 --> 30:59.941
Not anymore.

31:00.900 --> 31:02.610
I can't. I'm tired
of living in the shadows.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.571
You're never going to stop chasing
your political career,

31:04.696 --> 31:06.072
and I need to take my life back.

31:40.440 --> 31:41.608
Please don't do this.

31:51.576 --> 31:52.410
I'm sorry.

32:28.446 --> 32:30.114
-How's Joaquin?
-He's fine.

32:30.490 --> 32:32.450
Get your things, we're going to see him.

32:33.076 --> 32:34.202
Take it Perez, take it.

32:35.078 --> 32:35.912
Take it.

32:36.579 --> 32:37.830
Take it, Perez.

32:42.377 --> 32:43.503
Ready?

32:44.295 --> 32:45.296
Yeah. Let's go.

32:45.421 --> 32:46.339
Like the mom.

32:47.674 --> 32:49.217
Mom, what about Perez?

32:49.509 --> 32:51.219
Where we're going we can't take Perez.

32:52.929 --> 32:55.056
It's too risky,
and we'd draw too much attention.

32:55.765 --> 32:57.725
Perez! Perez!

32:57.850 --> 33:00.186
Perez is here! I don't want to!

33:00.311 --> 33:01.187
Let's go.

33:20.707 --> 33:21.541
We're heading out.

33:47.817 --> 33:48.985
Report back immediately.

33:50.737 --> 33:51.612
Any news?

33:53.072 --> 33:55.199
We still haven't seen
any suspicious movement.

34:00.663 --> 34:02.457
Did you distribute units where I asked?

34:02.540 --> 34:03.624
Yes, sir.

34:06.711 --> 34:08.046
Did you increase the checkpoints?

34:08.171 --> 34:09.464
Affirmative, Mr. Secretary.

34:10.256 --> 34:12.717
Apart from the main roads,
we've covered alternate roads

34:12.800 --> 34:14.218
that lead towards the entrances
and exits in Culiacan.

34:38.534 --> 34:42.246
JOAQUIN'S SAFE RANCH
COSALA, SINALOA

34:49.128 --> 34:50.463
Any news from Hector?

34:52.090 --> 34:53.091
They're on their way.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.403
They're checking the cars.

35:15.822 --> 35:17.281
Here too.

35:18.908 --> 35:20.952
Open your map and follow my instructions.

35:24.497 --> 35:25.373
Look.

35:28.501 --> 35:30.294
Turn around as soon as you can.

35:30.378 --> 35:32.004
Look for the dirt road.

35:39.679 --> 35:41.055
We turned around.

35:46.144 --> 35:47.186
Me too.

35:56.529 --> 35:57.363
How are you doing?

35:57.905 --> 35:59.323
I'm on the dirt road.

36:00.199 --> 36:01.325
Keep going straight.

36:05.621 --> 36:06.455
I can't.

36:06.956 --> 36:07.790
Why?

36:08.416 --> 36:10.001
There's a police check-point, Hector.
They're going to get us.

36:11.294 --> 36:12.336
Turn back, Elba.

36:12.837 --> 36:15.089
Get back home. I'll meet you there.

36:33.608 --> 36:34.483
Dad.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.862
Elba and the girls weren't able
to get out of Culiacan.

36:37.987 --> 36:39.363
-Are they okay?
-Yeah.

36:39.530 --> 36:40.865
They're safe at home now,

36:40.948 --> 36:41.782
but they won't be able to make it.

36:45.453 --> 36:47.246
We'll come up with another plan
to get them here.

36:48.414 --> 36:50.833
That might take days or weeks,
and you have to leave.

36:51.626 --> 36:53.669
I might have to leave, but I won't leave
without seeing them first.

37:00.718 --> 37:03.054
LOS ANGELES
CALIFORNIA, USA

37:19.445 --> 37:21.072
TEXT MESSAGE
VALDOVINOS

37:21.656 --> 37:23.324
Can you give me a moment alone, please?

37:44.971 --> 37:45.846
Hello?

37:46.013 --> 37:48.557
Miss? My name is Garduño,

37:48.766 --> 37:50.351
I'm an attorney who
was Valdovinos' partner.

37:50.768 --> 37:52.436
I'm calling on behalf of the boss.

37:52.853 --> 37:55.189
I didn't think you'd be contacting me,
after everything that's happened.

37:55.690 --> 37:58.234
My partner contacted you
to propose a project.

38:00.528 --> 38:02.613
Well, our client wants
to get it back on track.

38:04.240 --> 38:05.366
But how?

38:06.575 --> 38:08.619
We'll deal with the logistics.

38:08.744 --> 38:10.830
The important thing is knowing
if you're still interested.

38:13.749 --> 38:15.626
My client would like
to have a meeting with you,

38:15.918 --> 38:17.545
but we don't have much time to do that.

38:21.215 --> 38:22.049
I wouldn't go alone.

38:23.092 --> 38:25.344
No problem,
we can coordinate that.

38:25.428 --> 38:26.595
HEADQUARTERS FOR TELEPHONE RESEARCH, DEA
UNITED STATES

38:26.679 --> 38:28.556
All right, we'll be ready.

38:39.191 --> 38:41.777
GUADALAJARA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

38:59.337 --> 39:00.421
They're with me.

39:01.881 --> 39:03.215
We're headed over to the plane.

39:03.799 --> 39:04.842
We're on our way.

39:04.967 --> 39:06.093
I'll pick you up at the runway.

39:07.011 --> 39:08.596
My dad will wait for us at the meet point.

39:44.090 --> 39:46.342
Gentlemen,
I'll ask that for your own safety,

39:46.842 --> 39:48.302
you turn off your cell phones

39:48.719 --> 39:50.805
and electronic devices
and store them here, please.

40:03.526 --> 40:05.945
They've deactivated their telephones,
but we've tracked them.

40:06.362 --> 40:07.947
They're boarding a plane.

40:09.990 --> 40:11.200
Can we track them?

40:11.742 --> 40:13.619
As soon as they take flight,
Mr. Secretary.

40:40.146 --> 40:40.980
We've got them.

40:50.573 --> 40:55.453
LONG: 60° EAST
LAT: 20° NORTH

41:05.963 --> 41:08.174
WILDLIFE RESERVE
SINALOA

41:26.609 --> 41:28.110
Thank you for your help,
professor.

41:29.028 --> 41:30.112
Here's what we agreed on.

41:30.613 --> 41:32.198
The guys will take you back into town.

41:33.073 --> 41:33.908
Thank you, sir.

41:52.176 --> 41:53.469
They must be close to landing.

41:54.136 --> 41:56.430
When they're close to their destination,

41:56.680 --> 41:59.558
traffickers tend to lower their planes
because they know they can evade radars.

42:00.100 --> 42:02.436
-Can we locate the landing zone?
-Yes, sir.

42:03.229 --> 42:04.063
Enlarge the map.

42:50.109 --> 42:53.112
How many officers can go
to Cosala at this moment?

42:53.237 --> 42:55.114
Have the search and location operation

42:55.197 --> 42:56.865
focus across 12 miles
around the location.

42:59.577 --> 43:01.245
I want all the forces available.

43:09.336 --> 43:10.713
Chapo's luck has run out.

43:17.928 --> 43:18.762
Nice to meet you.

43:23.517 --> 43:24.602
Welcome, friend.

43:30.357 --> 43:32.276
