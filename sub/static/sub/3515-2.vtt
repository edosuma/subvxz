00:05.640 --> 00:08.119
I was not able to find out why
your brother went to Portland.

I know why.
He took the Grimm.

He's not here.

We think he may have
survived the crash.

He may not be himself.

00:33.480 --> 00:35.608
So you need to
prepare yourselves.

00:41.040 --> 00:42.280
Can you follow him?
I can try.

00:42.360 --> 00:43.407
Go.

You lose him?

faster than I thought.

REPORTER: (ON LAPTOP) Just after 8:00 p.m.
this evening in Vienna, Austria,

14:48.520 --> 14:50.887
Eric Renard, crown prince
of the Kronenberg family,

14:50.960 --> 14:52.724
was killed when his car exploded

14:52.800 --> 14:55.087
en route from the Vienna
International Airport.

14:55.160 --> 14:58.130
No one has yet claimed responsibility
for this tragic event.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.726
All of Vienna is in mourning.

15:00.800 --> 15:03.007
All of Portland isn't.

15:11.360 --> 15:15.968
I mean, if the Royals are going to
this extent to try to get a Grimm...

15:16.040 --> 15:17.246
This might hurt...

15:17.320 --> 15:18.526
A lot!

15:19.320 --> 15:20.321
Ow!

15:20.680 --> 15:21.920
Not kidding.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.650
Sorry.
That cut's a little deep.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.404
MONROE: I didn't
know that until now.

15:25.480 --> 15:26.527
All right, wait...

15:26.600 --> 15:27.601
Okay, let me have it.

15:27.680 --> 15:29.728
That's what I'm thinking. If they're
willing to do what they did,

15:29.800 --> 15:32.690
there's got to be some
serious stuff in the works.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.048
Nick, can you hear me?

15:40.080 --> 15:42.208
Hey, he's waking up.

15:43.280 --> 15:44.361
Nick!

15:45.320 --> 15:46.446
Can you hear us?

15:47.520 --> 15:49.170
What's going on?

15:51.240 --> 15:52.241
What are you doing?

15:55.320 --> 15:56.526
Checking your pulse.

15:57.120 --> 15:58.167
Why?

15:58.480 --> 16:02.530
That's got kind of a long
answer attached to it.

16:02.600 --> 16:04.329
What's going on?

16:05.680 --> 16:07.603
Why am I handcuffed?

16:08.000 --> 16:09.445
We didn't want you to fall over.

16:11.720 --> 16:12.721
Oh.

16:12.880 --> 16:15.167
Okay.
That is a bad headache.

16:17.120 --> 16:18.451
How'd I get here?

16:18.520 --> 16:20.124
We brought you.

16:24.600 --> 16:26.250
I'm really sore.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.081
Kind of everywhere.

16:28.160 --> 16:30.925
But you look a lot better.

16:31.440 --> 16:32.965
A lot better.

16:37.040 --> 16:38.929

Of a sort.

HANK: You don't
remember anything?

16:44.120 --> 16:45.849
You got your cast off.

16:46.920 --> 16:48.120
Yeah, I did.
You remember that.

16:48.960 --> 16:51.645
I remember you
saying you were going to.

16:51.720 --> 16:54.041
What's the last
thing you remember?

16:54.200 --> 16:56.521
Uh, I'm not really sure.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.204
We were at the shipping yard.

16:59.280 --> 17:01.203
Yeah, I remember that.

17:02.520 --> 17:04.045
We were trying to stop
what was happening...

17:04.119 --> 17:05.645
And you had the medicine.

17:06.720 --> 17:10.202
But we got separated,
and I was chasing somebody.

17:10.280 --> 17:11.611
Baron...
Samedi.

17:11.960 --> 17:12.960
The guy with the hat.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.240
The hat dude. You got it.

17:14.319 --> 17:15.445
I was chasing him.

17:17.720 --> 17:19.131
And then we fell.

17:20.359 --> 17:21.361
Ah!

17:22.800 --> 17:25.121
And I found
a passport with my photo.

But somebody else's name...

17:30.880 --> 17:32.484
Thomas something.

17:33.440 --> 17:35.329
And that's pretty much it.

17:37.320 --> 17:38.606
I must've gotten hit.

17:39.320 --> 17:41.891
And I guess you guys found me
and brought me here, right?

17:47.000 --> 17:48.445

Juliette should go.

Okay.

I screwed it up
and they got away?

No, Nick, there's much
more to it than that.

involved in that bar fight

19:29.760 --> 19:31.888

a Thomas Schirach

as the probable.

That would make
sense. He...

19:42.120 --> 19:44.726
He was identified as a possible
source of the outbreak.

19:44.800 --> 19:45.961

more than a description

surveillance at the bar,

destroyed the system,

were under the influence of...

we gonna explain it?

to us in a very physical way,

wanna share with anybody else.

what the cause of death was.

what the cause of death was.

Very carefully.

with Rosalee and Juliette.

and so will they.

has to be the same story.

Now right now, they think they're
looking for Thomas Schirach,

24:49.080 --> 24:51.924
and we need to make sure that
they keep thinking that way.

you're asking us to do?

fought at the bar has died.

He wasn't himself.

You can't defend
what you can't explain.

26:10.480 --> 26:12.369
So Nick is a murderer.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.570
Technically.
But...

26:17.480 --> 26:19.164
So far, no one knows
Nick was in the bar.

responsible for the death

26:20.480 --> 26:23.165
has been identified
as Thomas Schirach.

26:23.440 --> 26:24.771
Which works for me,
because I don't think

26:24.840 --> 26:26.285
we can blame Nick
for what happened.

26:26.360 --> 26:28.442
He was poisoned.
He would've died.

26:29.920 --> 26:31.445
As long as they're looking
for Thomas Schirach,

26:31.520 --> 26:33.443
Nick is in the clear.

26:33.520 --> 26:34.726
Ironically, the false identity

26:34.800 --> 26:36.768
my brother created to get
Nick out of the country

26:36.840 --> 26:38.046
is working in our favor.

What if they see Nick in the
surveillance recordings?

26:42.960 --> 26:45.201
So far, none has been found.

26:47.120 --> 26:48.121
Okay.

26:48.200 --> 26:50.282
Two detectives have been
assigned to the case.

26:50.360 --> 26:51.600
From the police reports,
they're gonna know

26:51.680 --> 26:53.125
that there were two women
with me that night,

26:53.200 --> 26:54.840
and they're gonna
wanna talk to all of us.

not the truth.

26:58.920 --> 27:00.001
Right.

27:03.120 --> 27:04.406
Hank, are you good with this?

27:07.840 --> 27:09.251
I'm not good with
Nick going to prison

27:09.320 --> 27:11.561
for something he didn't
even know he was doing.

27:12.880 --> 27:14.211
You heard him.

27:14.600 --> 27:16.887
He doesn't remember anything.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.240

27:21.320 --> 27:24.688
So we are all going
to lie to protect Nick.

What happens if he finds out?

27:26.480 --> 27:28.244
Hopefully he throws
us a little party.

27:30.640 --> 27:31.846
He's not going to find out.

27:33.440 --> 27:35.044
At least,
not for a little while.

27:37.360 --> 27:39.931
Now look, we all have
to agree on three things.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.082
We were chasing
down infected suspects,

27:42.160 --> 27:44.401
one of them was identified
as Thomas Schirach,

27:44.480 --> 27:45.686
and you two were there

27:45.760 --> 27:47.330
because you had a treatment
that was effective.

27:47.400 --> 27:49.607
See? Not so bad.

27:50.040 --> 27:51.201
Some of it's true.

27:52.600 --> 27:54.284
Now we have to
decide on the details.

27:55.160 --> 27:57.049
Because that is
how you get caught.

27:57.640 --> 27:58.641
Hmm.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.251
BAUER: What time was that?

28:11.960 --> 28:12.961
Uh-huh.

28:13.360 --> 28:15.249
Anybody else with him?

28:16.120 --> 28:17.485
Hey.

28:17.920 --> 28:19.809
Heard you guys got
the bar fight kill.

28:20.240 --> 28:22.447
Yeah. Hell of a case.

28:22.960 --> 28:25.247
All the witnesses say
this Thomas Schirach guy

28:25.320 --> 28:26.765
was a freaking monster.

28:26.840 --> 28:28.444
Big, bad.

28:28.720 --> 28:30.449
There was nothing they
could do to stop him.

28:30.760 --> 28:34.003
After the bar fight, apparently he
accosted some family in their house.

28:34.400 --> 28:35.401
Really?

28:35.480 --> 28:36.720
Thanks.

28:37.720 --> 28:39.051
Guess what I found out.

28:39.200 --> 28:41.328
That family that was
attacked in that house...

28:41.600 --> 28:45.002
Mr. Avery claims some guys showed
up before the unis got there.

28:45.080 --> 28:47.890
Said they were cops. Told
them to go back inside.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.564
He says Schirach got away

28:49.640 --> 28:52.007
because when the unis got
there, they were all gone.

28:52.080 --> 28:53.411
They have
surveillance at the bar?

28:53.480 --> 28:55.323
There was at the time.
It was trashed in the fight.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.561
All the files were missing.

28:56.680 --> 28:58.330
Maybe he was smart
enough to take it.

28:58.400 --> 28:59.561
He didn't take anything else.

28:59.840 --> 29:01.120
He was just looking for trouble.

29:03.240 --> 29:04.969
Well, if there's anything I can
help you with, let me know.

29:05.040 --> 29:07.247
You can stay here and fill out
all these reports for us.

29:07.320 --> 29:08.367
Bye.

29:09.600 --> 29:10.601
(KNOCKING)

29:10.680 --> 29:11.841
Yeah?

29:15.520 --> 29:17.921
Just talked to Holtby and Bauer.
Mmm-hmm.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.765
Surveillance system
at the bar got trashed.

29:21.800 --> 29:22.961
That so?

29:23.040 --> 29:25.008
That was convenient.

29:27.080 --> 29:29.003
What do you think happened?

29:29.480 --> 29:31.084
I think somebody
took the flash drive,

29:31.160 --> 29:34.050
trashed the office to make it look
like it happened in the fight.

29:34.120 --> 29:36.168
That's lucky for us.
Yeah.

29:36.520 --> 29:38.648
As long as it doesn't turn up.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

29:39.400 --> 29:40.970
Got a minute?
Yeah.

29:42.960 --> 29:44.803
Sorry to bother you, sir.
Just a couple questions.

29:44.880 --> 29:46.848
Report says you were
at the bar last night.

29:46.920 --> 29:48.126
That's right.

29:48.200 --> 29:50.646
BAUER: There were two women with you.
The report doesn't give their names.

29:50.720 --> 29:52.210
We need to follow up.

29:53.160 --> 29:55.128
I'll write them down for you.

30:18.920 --> 30:20.365
Nick?

30:21.840 --> 30:24.081
Hey, what's wrong?
You feel cold.

30:26.360 --> 30:28.044
Hey, wake up!

30:30.760 --> 30:33.001
Nick! Nick!

30:33.840 --> 30:35.171
Nick!

30:39.320 --> 30:40.606
Nick!

30:41.600 --> 30:42.965
Nick!

30:51.280 --> 30:52.520
What time is it?

30:52.920 --> 30:54.968
OPERATOR: (OVER PHONE)
911. What is your emergency?

30:55.360 --> 30:57.124
Who are you calling?

30:57.360 --> 30:58.566
What's wrong?

30:59.080 --> 31:00.923
OPERATOR:
What is your emergency?

31:02.040 --> 31:04.611
Nothing. I made a
mistake, I'm sorry.

31:07.320 --> 31:08.810
How do you feel?

31:09.600 --> 31:11.887
Like, I don't know. Fine.

31:13.520 --> 31:15.363
Except my face
hurts a little bit.

31:15.440 --> 31:17.329
You need to see a doctor.

31:18.080 --> 31:19.411
Why?

31:22.280 --> 31:24.044
What are you doing
that for? I feel fine.

31:24.120 --> 31:25.167
You didn't look fine.

31:25.960 --> 31:27.450
Well, how did I look?

31:29.120 --> 31:30.326
You looked dead.

31:31.320 --> 31:32.731
And you were really
cold to the touch,

31:32.800 --> 31:36.168
and I couldn't find your pulse,
and it's still really slow.

31:36.960 --> 31:38.564
Are you sure you feel okay?

31:38.880 --> 31:40.689
Well, I did until
you told me I was dead.

31:40.760 --> 31:42.171
I'm serious.
You're seeing a doctor.

31:42.320 --> 31:43.481
Does a vet count?

31:44.000 --> 31:46.526
Nick. I'm just trying to
get my heart rate up.

31:47.520 --> 31:48.521
You really scared me.

31:49.400 --> 31:50.447
Hey.

31:51.920 --> 31:54.161
I'm sorry, but I really
do feel okay.

31:57.160 --> 31:58.640
I think you need to
just lie back down

31:58.680 --> 32:00.762
and we'll take this
a little bit more slowly.

32:02.920 --> 32:04.604
I can do that.

32:10.320 --> 32:11.845
Hey.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.843
I'm really okay.

32:23.360 --> 32:24.486
It's time.

32:27.080 --> 32:28.491
For what?

32:28.680 --> 32:30.967
To reap what you have sewn.

32:33.360 --> 32:35.010
You'll want to fill that up.

32:35.080 --> 32:36.730
With what?

32:59.160 --> 33:02.403
It's really very
good for the skin.

33:03.080 --> 33:04.809
And for your child.

33:06.240 --> 33:07.241
Mmm.

33:17.920 --> 33:21.288
Looks like our voodoo hordes
used up all our acorus calamus

33:21.360 --> 33:23.840
and the erythroxylum
novogranatense.

33:23.920 --> 33:25.524
I'll order some
more just in case.

33:25.600 --> 33:27.170
Do you know how old
that stuff was anyway?

33:27.240 --> 33:28.287
I think my dad ordered it.

33:28.400 --> 33:30.721
Good thing it didn't go
bad, 'cause, you know...

33:30.800 --> 33:34.486
One zombie romp every
generation or so was plenty.

33:34.920 --> 33:36.410
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

33:45.480 --> 33:47.369
Hello. Can I help you?

33:47.440 --> 33:49.124
Rosalee Calvert?
Yes.

33:49.200 --> 33:51.441
I'm Detective Bauer.
This is Detective Holtby.

33:51.800 --> 33:52.961
We'd like to ask
you a few questions

33:53.040 --> 33:54.565
about what happened
the other night at the bar.

33:54.640 --> 33:56.165
We understand you were there.

33:56.240 --> 33:58.208
Yes, I was.
Please come in.

34:00.360 --> 34:02.408
You were there with Police
Captain Sean Renard.

34:03.120 --> 34:04.121
Yes.

34:08.199 --> 34:10.885
HOLTBY: What is it that
you do, Ms. Calvert?

34:10.960 --> 34:12.166
ROSALEE: I'm an apothecary.

34:12.239 --> 34:15.322
We offer herbal and organic
treatments and remedies

34:15.400 --> 34:16.889
for a variety of health issues.

34:17.600 --> 34:19.045
That's why I was
with the captain.

34:19.159 --> 34:20.366
We were attempting to treat

34:20.440 --> 34:23.409
an apparent outbreak of a
highly infectious neurotoxin

34:23.480 --> 34:25.369
that causes Lazarus syndrome.

34:25.440 --> 34:26.760
I was familiar
with the treatment,

34:26.800 --> 34:29.087
as was this woman
who was with me.

34:29.159 --> 34:30.810
That would be
Juliette Silverton?

34:31.159 --> 34:32.286
Yes.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.764
Have you ever heard
of a Thomas Schirach?

34:36.520 --> 34:39.409
Yes, I was told he's the
possible source of the outbreak

34:39.480 --> 34:42.290
and the man responsible for the
fight that happened at the bar.

34:42.360 --> 34:43.646
Could you describe him?

34:44.679 --> 34:47.331
ROSALEE: No, I'm sorry.
I never saw him.

34:54.080 --> 34:55.081

36:02.400 --> 36:03.401
Hey.

36:03.480 --> 36:05.289
Two detectives were
just here at the shop.

36:05.360 --> 36:06.850
They left about 15 minutes ago.

36:06.920 --> 36:09.241
I waited to make sure
they weren't coming back.

36:09.320 --> 36:10.321
How did it go?

36:10.400 --> 36:11.526
I stuck to the story.

36:11.600 --> 36:12.806
They believe you?

36:12.880 --> 36:14.041
I think so.

36:14.200 --> 36:16.248
(KNOCKING ON DOOR) Got it!

36:17.200 --> 36:18.201
Um...

36:18.360 --> 36:20.600
(WHISPERING) I can't really talk right now.
Nick's awake.

36:21.760 --> 36:22.921
What are you guys doing here?

36:23.040 --> 36:25.281
Uh... We're looking
for Juliette Silverton.

36:26.280 --> 36:27.691
Oh, it's your girlfriend.

36:28.440 --> 36:30.204
We didn't put two
and two together.

36:30.280 --> 36:31.281
Is Juliette home?

36:32.280 --> 36:33.327
Is there a problem?

36:33.400 --> 36:35.243
Not for her. The captain
gave us her name.

36:35.480 --> 36:37.528
As a possible
witness to a bar fight.

36:38.200 --> 36:40.168
You wanna talk to
her about a bar fight?

36:40.240 --> 36:42.208
Yeah, well, one of
the guys in the fight died.

36:43.800 --> 36:45.450
It's just a couple of questions.
It won't take very long.

36:45.520 --> 36:46.521
When did he die?

36:46.640 --> 36:48.210
In the hospital,
after the fight.

36:48.360 --> 36:50.442
I guess he was
beat up pretty bad.

36:50.560 --> 36:52.528
Anyway, now it's
murder and we got it.

36:52.680 --> 36:54.364
But it's better than those
crazies you were dealing with.

36:54.480 --> 36:55.527
Well, come on in.

36:55.600 --> 36:58.490
I will answer whatever
questions you guys have.

37:01.800 --> 37:04.531
HOLTBY: You were there with
Police Captain Sean Renard?

37:04.600 --> 37:05.601
JULIETTE: Yes.

37:07.360 --> 37:09.203
You ever hear of
a Thomas Schirach?

37:09.280 --> 37:11.681
Yeah, I believe he was

37:11.760 --> 37:14.161
the one they said was
responsible for the bar fight.

37:14.680 --> 37:16.125
And what were you doing there?

37:16.560 --> 37:17.561
We were

37:17.640 --> 37:20.120
attempting to help the
situation with the outbreak.

37:20.400 --> 37:21.970
The woman I was with,
Rosalee Calvert,

37:22.040 --> 37:23.485
and I, were familiar
with the treatment

37:23.560 --> 37:24.925
for this rare neurotoxin.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.765
It's highly infectious
and causes Lazarus syndrome.

37:27.840 --> 37:29.520
HOLTBY: You ever get
a look at the suspect?

37:30.280 --> 37:31.611
No.

37:31.720 --> 37:34.007
No, he was gone by
the time we got there.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.286
Nick, you okay?

37:40.200 --> 37:42.168
Yeah. Just broke
a coffee cup.

37:42.840 --> 37:44.330
We're done here.

37:44.400 --> 37:46.004
Be careful with
that coffee, Burkhardt.

37:46.120 --> 37:48.043
It might be loaded.
(LAUGHS)

37:48.160 --> 37:50.208
Wouldn't want you to get burned.

37:54.040 --> 37:56.202
JULIETTE: Thanks, guys.
Thank you.

37:59.520 --> 38:01.966
Someone died in that bar fight?
Why didn't you tell me?

38:02.040 --> 38:03.804
You didn't know what you were doing.
You weren't yourself.

38:03.880 --> 38:05.211
That doesn't matter.

38:05.280 --> 38:07.681
If I killed somebody,
I have to turn myself in.

38:07.760 --> 38:09.524
We all agreed on a story.

38:09.880 --> 38:13.043
Who agreed? Me, Monroe,
Rosalee, Hank, your captain.

38:13.120 --> 38:14.531
So you're all lying?

38:15.360 --> 38:16.521
To protect you.

38:17.840 --> 38:18.966
You can't do that.

38:20.800 --> 38:22.643
I killed someone.

38:23.080 --> 38:25.686
Nick, if you turn yourself
in, we're all in trouble.

You can't do this.
Get out of my way, Hank.

38:50.880 --> 38:53.042
I'm already in the way,
and so are the rest of us.

38:53.120 --> 38:55.327
We made a decision. You
were not in good shape.

38:55.400 --> 38:57.004
You had no idea
what you were doing.

38:57.080 --> 38:58.844
I've heard it all, Hank.

39:00.320 --> 39:02.607
You tried to kill me, Nick.

39:05.960 --> 39:08.531
You tried to kill
Monroe and the captain.

39:08.600 --> 39:10.250
And you would have
had we not worked together

39:10.320 --> 39:11.924
to take you down.

39:14.280 --> 39:16.681
And ask Juliette how it
felt to get hit by you.

39:18.600 --> 39:20.443
Now, you wanna turn
yourself in, go ahead.

39:20.520 --> 39:22.602
But you're going to do it alone.

Yes. Tragic.

do the right thing.

You're gonna try to
talk me out of it.

40:18.240 --> 40:19.321
Let me show you something.

40:30.920 --> 40:32.763
Recognize yourself?

40:39.520 --> 40:41.409
Pay close attention to
the guy with the knife.

40:43.360 --> 40:44.725
His name was Mitchell Zinc.

40:45.680 --> 40:48.809
He died in the hospital
at 5:40 in the morning.

40:48.880 --> 40:51.247
And if you hadn't done what you
did, you probably be dead.

40:53.200 --> 40:55.806
This is one of those times, Nick,
where you walk in two worlds.

40:55.880 --> 40:58.326
You know why you did it.
You just can't explain it,

40:58.400 --> 40:59.686
at least not in a court of law.

41:02.040 --> 41:04.566
Sometimes justice isn't obvious.

41:10.560 --> 41:12.403
You have to understand
something, Nick.

41:12.480 --> 41:13.970
My brother did this to you.

41:15.560 --> 41:17.164
It was all part of a
plan to destroy a Grimm,

41:17.240 --> 41:18.760
or at least to get
one to work for him.

41:21.760 --> 41:23.603

you will give them
exactly what they want.

How's it going?

42:08.440 --> 42:09.646
Okay.
