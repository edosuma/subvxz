NARRATOR: Previously on
Once Upon A Time...

00:02.962 --> 00:04.668
REGINA:
When we face our deepest fears,

00:04.755 --> 00:05.881
our true courage comes out.

00:05.965 --> 00:09.128
When you used the hilt of your sword
to vanquish your fears, she took it.

00:09.260 --> 00:10.295
You're amazing!

00:10.428 --> 00:12.384
GOLD: You’ll never get close
to Snow White’s baby.

00:12.471 --> 00:16.339
It no longer matters.
I have your beautiful brain.

00:16.434 --> 00:19.016
ZELENA: The next time your lips
touch Emma Swan’s,

00:19.103 --> 00:21.719
all of her magic will be taken.

00:21.814 --> 00:23.930
Would you mind holding onto this
for a bit longer?

00:24.650 --> 00:25.981
REGINA:
Our mother taught me one thing,

00:26.110 --> 00:28.066
never bring your heart to a witch fight.

00:28.154 --> 00:29.485
I will get your heart.

00:29.614 --> 00:30.774
Not today.

00:36.662 --> 00:37.947
(DOORBELL RINGS)

00:53.179 --> 00:54.385
A gift.

01:01.979 --> 01:03.355
From sister to sister.

01:05.149 --> 01:06.514
What are you doing here?

01:08.027 --> 01:11.485
I saw your tree, and I thought
you could use something better.

01:11.572 --> 01:14.405
Red apples are so sickly sweet,
don't you think?

01:14.492 --> 01:17.950
People tend to like
something a little sharper.

01:18.037 --> 01:20.870
And green apples are just bitter.

01:21.999 --> 01:23.580
That's not yours.

01:23.960 --> 01:24.949
(SCOFFS)

01:25.044 --> 01:26.159
Story of my life.

01:26.254 --> 01:27.539
Why are you here?

01:27.880 --> 01:31.668
Oh, sisterly concern, sisterly advice,
you know.

01:32.426 --> 01:35.463
Wanted to make sure you were all right
after our little showdown.

01:35.554 --> 01:37.385
I'm fine. Are you?

01:37.515 --> 01:38.925
Getting there.

01:39.016 --> 01:40.005
Wow.

01:40.268 --> 01:41.724
This is nice.

01:42.853 --> 01:44.514
So luxurious.

01:44.855 --> 01:47.392
You really don't appreciate
what you have, do you?

01:47.525 --> 01:52.019
Right, because I got everything
and you have nothing.

01:52.571 --> 01:56.063
If you want your superpower to be envy,
go right ahead.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.482
Envy's just another word for "ambition."

01:58.577 --> 02:00.829
Well, that's just not true.

02:00.913 --> 02:04.201
See, I strive for things. I work.

02:04.709 --> 02:06.290
You? (SCOFFS)

02:06.377 --> 02:09.210
You cast a curse that was just
a fancy form of running away.

02:09.755 --> 02:10.870
With every advantage,

02:10.965 --> 02:13.957
you still turn your back
on every opportunity for happiness.

02:14.051 --> 02:16.087
You, Regina,

02:16.220 --> 02:17.926
you just don't take risks.

02:18.055 --> 02:22.424
You don't live your life.
It's just such a waste.

02:24.562 --> 02:26.894
I can see why our mother
was so disappointed in you.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.555
Disappointed in me?

02:30.943 --> 02:32.729
She gave you away.

02:35.448 --> 02:38.281
You have no idea what really happened.

02:38.409 --> 02:40.445
That's exactly what's going to hurt you.

02:41.370 --> 02:43.031
(LAUGHS)

02:43.247 --> 02:45.829
You didn't come here
to give me sisterly advice.

02:46.292 --> 02:47.657
Why are you really here?

02:47.752 --> 02:49.083
So perceptive.

02:50.254 --> 02:51.460
I'm here, Regina,

02:51.589 --> 02:54.501
because I wanted to make sure
that you weren't someplace else.

02:54.592 --> 02:56.583
So I could take what I need.

02:57.261 --> 02:59.172
Or, rather, the Dark One could.

02:59.263 --> 03:01.094
Do you feel it, sis?

03:01.599 --> 03:02.964
He's taking your heart.

03:04.769 --> 03:05.758
(LAUGHS)

03:07.480 --> 03:08.469
(GRUNTS)

03:09.231 --> 03:10.641
ROBIN HOOD: Stop right there!

03:15.738 --> 03:17.945
You know,
this arrow never misses its mark.

03:18.074 --> 03:19.985
If I could stand down, I would.

03:21.327 --> 03:22.316
Heed me.

03:23.746 --> 03:24.826
Give me the heart.

03:24.997 --> 03:25.986
No.

03:26.957 --> 03:27.946
(SIGHS)

03:29.960 --> 03:31.746
And who is this?

03:32.129 --> 03:33.460
Roland! Go back!

03:33.798 --> 03:34.878
Come here, little boy.

03:34.965 --> 03:36.091
Don't.

03:37.593 --> 03:38.582
Please.

03:38.969 --> 03:40.095
I don't want to.

03:42.139 --> 03:43.515
I really don't.

03:44.141 --> 03:46.006
Come closer, little boy.

03:47.269 --> 03:48.884
(GRUNTS) Daddy!

03:48.979 --> 03:50.059
And stop!

03:50.147 --> 03:51.136
(RUMBLING)

03:52.858 --> 03:54.143
Daddy! Help!

03:54.276 --> 03:56.358
I didn't want to do this, either. But...

03:57.780 --> 03:59.611
It never misses its target.

04:01.283 --> 04:03.319
And I've just changed the target.

04:04.995 --> 04:06.656
If I drop my finger...

04:06.789 --> 04:07.824
No!

04:08.707 --> 04:09.833
I don't want to.

04:11.001 --> 04:12.127
But I will.

04:13.462 --> 04:14.497
Daddy!

04:14.672 --> 04:15.957
Wait!

04:17.049 --> 04:18.164
Wait!

04:26.517 --> 04:27.723
(HEART BEATING)

04:28.561 --> 04:29.550
(SIGHS)

04:31.188 --> 04:33.975
Thank you. And I am sorry.

04:34.483 --> 04:35.472
Truly.

04:36.110 --> 04:37.099
(GASPS)

04:43.284 --> 04:44.740
(PANTING)

04:44.869 --> 04:48.077
Oh, it's okay. It's okay, boy, you're safe.
You're safe.

04:50.749 --> 04:53.206
You're okay. It's okay.

04:56.088 --> 04:57.373
Go with Friar Tuck.

04:59.049 --> 05:00.550
What happened?

05:01.051 --> 05:02.882
I'm sorry. It's gone.

05:05.222 --> 05:06.382
Was anyone hurt?

05:08.267 --> 05:09.347
I want this one...

05:09.727 --> 05:10.762
Luckily, no.

05:11.562 --> 05:14.269
Again, I must apologize.
You trusted me, and I let you down.

05:14.398 --> 05:17.515
No, you didn't.
Nothing is worth the loss of a child.

05:17.902 --> 05:21.190
But now, we have a problem. I'm alive.

05:22.072 --> 05:23.232
I don't follow.

05:23.574 --> 05:25.860
She has my heart.
Gold's taken it for her.

05:25.951 --> 05:27.407
And since she hasn't
crushed it and killed me,

05:27.495 --> 05:30.157
that means she needs it
for something far worse.

05:30.247 --> 05:32.738
Worse than murder?
What is she planning?

05:32.875 --> 05:34.240
It doesn't matter.

05:35.461 --> 05:37.372
Because I'm going to stop her.

05:48.098 --> 05:50.225
(CLATTERING)

05:53.729 --> 05:55.390
This is all useless crap!

05:55.481 --> 05:57.972
Hey, hey! Hey, stop! Stop it!

05:58.609 --> 05:59.769
What are you looking for?

06:00.152 --> 06:02.108
I need to destroy my sister.
She has my heart.

06:02.279 --> 06:03.439
-(EXHALES SHARPLY)
-Relax,

06:03.531 --> 06:05.988
she can't control me with it.
I protected it from that.

06:06.617 --> 06:10.326
The problem is, I don't know what
she's planning on using it for.

06:10.454 --> 06:12.945
Which is why I need to take her out.

06:13.624 --> 06:15.455
That's why I need your help.

06:16.585 --> 06:17.620
What do you have here?

06:18.003 --> 06:19.743
What do I have here?

06:20.464 --> 06:21.749
Self-respect!

06:22.800 --> 06:25.462
Why on Earth, or any realm,
would I help you?

06:25.719 --> 06:26.708
(SCOFFS)

06:26.804 --> 06:29.671
The woman who imprisoned me
in a tower in her castle.

06:30.516 --> 06:34.008
Then put me in an asylum for 28 years,

06:34.144 --> 06:38.262
who's done nothing but
mentally and physically torture me

06:38.357 --> 06:40.268
ever since we've known each other.

06:40.359 --> 06:41.348
Huh.

06:41.652 --> 06:42.858
Bookworm's got teeth.

06:43.362 --> 06:44.818
(SCOFFS) Get out.

06:45.114 --> 06:46.149
Yes,

06:46.824 --> 06:49.031
I did all those horrible things

06:49.827 --> 06:51.363
in the past.

06:51.495 --> 06:54.453
But right now, I need something

06:54.540 --> 06:58.283
to defeat the woman who's
puppet-mastering your boyfriend.

06:58.377 --> 06:59.457
She has your Rumple.

06:59.545 --> 07:02.378
And unless you help me,
you may never see him again.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.670
I'm sorry, Belle.

07:08.804 --> 07:11.671
I really, really am.

07:13.601 --> 07:14.590
(SCOFFS)

07:17.730 --> 07:19.391
So I've been trying to match

07:19.523 --> 07:21.855
the ingredients
that Zelena's been collecting

07:21.984 --> 07:25.021
to whatever spell she intends to cast.

07:25.154 --> 07:30.148
But it would really help if! knew
what is so special about your heart.

07:30.242 --> 07:33.075
Does she just want it
because you're sisters, or...

07:33.203 --> 07:34.704
I have no idea.

07:36.832 --> 07:37.867
The candle.

07:38.292 --> 07:39.281
(SNAPS FINGERS)

07:39.376 --> 07:40.491
Where's the candle?

07:41.920 --> 07:42.955
Here?

07:43.047 --> 07:44.207
Not that, Liberace.

07:44.340 --> 07:47.423
The two-sided candle Snow used
to kill my mother. Where's that?

07:48.177 --> 07:49.166
(SIGHS)

07:49.261 --> 07:51.718
Its power is gone. Now it's just a relic.

07:53.891 --> 07:55.882
Yes, that's it.

07:56.393 --> 07:58.509
This isn't about how my mother died.

07:59.396 --> 08:01.887
This is about how she lived.

08:02.191 --> 08:03.556
There you go, Cora.

08:04.276 --> 08:05.311
Whoop! (CHUCKLING)

08:05.402 --> 08:06.858
Cora! There she is.

08:08.113 --> 08:09.694
And there you go!

08:11.033 --> 08:12.113
Off with you!

08:12.284 --> 08:13.319
-(MAN LAUGHING)
-Ah!

08:13.410 --> 08:14.866
Give us a dance, lassie. Come on!

08:14.953 --> 08:16.113
Let it go, Charlie!

08:17.122 --> 08:18.111
(GASPS)

08:18.207 --> 08:19.367
I'm so sorry!

08:19.583 --> 08:20.789
Sit down, Cora.

08:21.251 --> 08:23.458
You've already worked
past the end of your shift,

08:24.296 --> 08:25.911
and, I dare say, you've earned it.

08:26.423 --> 08:27.412
Thank you.

08:30.135 --> 08:33.252
You know, I've watched you
this whole week that I've been here.

08:33.389 --> 08:35.596
You work in a tavern,
but you move like a lady.

08:36.767 --> 08:39.975
I'm just a miller's daughter.
I earn a little extra here.

08:40.604 --> 08:43.061
Someone once told me
to act like what you plan to be,

08:43.148 --> 08:45.230
so I try to be
a little better than what I am.

08:46.652 --> 08:47.937
Iwish I could stay.

08:48.821 --> 08:51.358
But tomorrow I must press on.

08:51.448 --> 08:53.188
I've already stayed
longer than I planned.

08:53.283 --> 08:55.239
Have you? Why?

08:55.327 --> 08:56.612
(CHUCKLING) I think you know why.

09:00.290 --> 09:03.782
Oh, that's... I didn't want you to...
(SIGHS)

09:03.919 --> 09:05.500
The royal crest.

09:07.005 --> 09:10.463
I wanted you to know me as me,
not as Prince Jonathan.

09:10.592 --> 09:11.798
Prince Jonathan.

09:12.177 --> 09:13.166
(SIGHS)

09:13.762 --> 09:14.717
With all the noblewomen,

09:14.805 --> 09:18.138
I end up feeling like the last kernel
of corn in the henhouse.

09:18.225 --> 09:21.217
But you? You put me in my place
when I'm wrong.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.602
And you are wrong pretty often.

09:24.690 --> 09:25.679
(BOTH LAUGHING)

09:29.611 --> 09:32.068
This isn't how it's supposed to go, but...

09:33.574 --> 09:35.565
I hoped to only ask this question
once in my life,

09:35.659 --> 09:37.900
but I'm going to ask it twice.

09:37.995 --> 09:39.656
Once now,

09:40.831 --> 09:44.619
with this ring made of straw.

09:46.587 --> 09:48.999
But I will come back in two weeks,

09:49.131 --> 09:50.996
and turn this ring into gold.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.500
Well, I'll bring you a gold one.
(CHUCKLING)

09:55.012 --> 09:58.004
And I'll whisk you away to the castle
as Princess Cora.

10:01.518 --> 10:02.678
Will you marry me?

10:05.647 --> 10:07.308
Yes. Yes!

10:07.566 --> 10:08.897
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

10:09.318 --> 10:10.854
You've made me so happy,

10:11.320 --> 10:13.606
oh, but these next two weeks
are going to be torture.

10:14.031 --> 10:16.363
Meet me at the crossroads,
so we don't waste any time!

10:16.492 --> 10:19.359
I'll be there!
When do you have to leave?

10:19.453 --> 10:21.159
Very early tomorrow, I'm afraid.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.450
The tavern closes soon.

10:26.043 --> 10:27.158
Well, then.

10:28.712 --> 10:32.045
But seeing as how
we are essentially married,

10:33.884 --> 10:37.001
perhaps I could
keep you company in your room?

10:55.906 --> 10:57.646
I'd watch out
for the apples in this house.

10:59.243 --> 11:00.232
Aye.

11:00.369 --> 11:02.576
It was a joke.
Where's your sense of humor?

11:03.247 --> 11:05.078
It left when the witch arrived.

11:05.207 --> 11:07.573
Well, we're gonna take care of that.
Regina said she has a plan.

11:07.668 --> 11:08.657
I'm sure she does.

11:08.752 --> 11:10.253
Emma, will you please tell your mother

11:10.379 --> 11:12.415
that we're not gonna
name your brother Leopold.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.497
Uh, why not? It was my father's name.

11:14.591 --> 11:15.671
People will make fun of him.

11:15.759 --> 11:16.999
My father was a king.

11:17.094 --> 11:18.254
Which is why nobody made fun of him.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.427
Okay, what about Eva, after my mother?

11:20.514 --> 11:22.596
I don't know how well that'll work
with a boy.

11:22.724 --> 11:24.009
It might not be a boy.

11:24.434 --> 11:25.685
REGINA: Sorry to keep you waiting.

11:25.769 --> 11:27.930
I was making this special tea.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.766
No, don't drink it!

11:33.902 --> 11:36.109
It's a deadly poison
for summoning the dark vortex.

11:36.572 --> 11:38.108
I prefer Earl Grey.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.233
The dark what?

11:39.950 --> 11:41.440
Zelena came by this morning.

11:43.120 --> 11:46.032
While the Dark One
was stealing my heart,

11:46.123 --> 11:48.284
she was here gloating.

11:48.417 --> 11:52.080
She said that my weakness was that
I don't know enough about her past.

11:52.462 --> 11:54.953
So, I've decided to summon
someone who does.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.291
We have to talk to my mother.

12:09.104 --> 12:10.093
(CHATTERING)

12:13.233 --> 12:16.896
Yes, I know it looks battered,
but that's the point.

12:31.335 --> 12:32.324
(SIGHS)

12:35.297 --> 12:36.503
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

12:36.840 --> 12:38.751
This will do perfectly.

12:38.884 --> 12:39.873
(SQUAWKS)

12:40.093 --> 12:41.082
(GRUNTING)

12:42.304 --> 12:43.840
Oh, don't be jealous.

12:46.183 --> 12:48.344
What do you want me to do with this?

12:48.435 --> 12:50.847
What do you think? Wear it.

12:52.314 --> 12:55.647
I've got Regina's heart,
Charming's courage,

12:56.360 --> 12:59.147
and right in here, ready to be plucked,

12:59.863 --> 13:01.524
your lovely brains.

13:02.032 --> 13:03.522
We've got everything we need.

13:04.201 --> 13:05.782
It's a good time to celebrate,
don't you think?

13:05.869 --> 13:07.200
You don't have everything.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.618
The baby will come.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.283
-Now, let's get you dressed.
-l'm not your doll.

13:11.375 --> 13:12.455
Aren't you?

13:13.126 --> 13:15.538
I'm not using the dagger. But I could.

13:16.838 --> 13:19.454
A certain baby could be here
at any minute,

13:19.549 --> 13:21.631
so I'm going to give you a choice

13:21.718 --> 13:24.334
on how you want
to live out the rest of this time.

13:24.721 --> 13:27.884
One choice is screaming agony.

13:29.059 --> 13:31.550
But the other is much more pleasant.

13:33.021 --> 13:35.558
Choose well, doll.

13:47.744 --> 13:51.737
It's a fairly simple ritual.
But not often performed.

13:52.249 --> 13:54.535
If it's easy to talk to the dead,
why not do it more?

13:54.876 --> 13:58.414
Well, because to do it, you need
the murder weapon and the murderer.

14:14.896 --> 14:16.181
What do we need to do?

14:17.024 --> 14:18.059
Focus on Cora.

14:18.942 --> 14:20.102
Welcoming thoughts?

14:20.235 --> 14:21.270
Whatever you've got.

14:25.115 --> 14:26.400
-ls it...

14:48.472 --> 14:49.757
We did it.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.303
Cora?

14:52.809 --> 14:54.140
Mother, can you hear us?

14:55.812 --> 14:57.598
Cora, give us a sign.

15:00.650 --> 15:03.062
Do not ignore me now, Mother!

15:04.571 --> 15:06.232
Please, you owe me this!

-Oh!

15:10.494 --> 15:11.825
Sorry, love.

15:11.912 --> 15:14.073
That was me. I crossed my legs
and bumped the table.

15:19.002 --> 15:19.991
(SIGHS)

15:25.967 --> 15:27.002
Do we try it again?

15:27.094 --> 15:28.834
No, there's no point.

15:28.929 --> 15:30.669
It worked. The portal opened,

15:32.015 --> 15:34.097
but nothing came from it.

15:34.184 --> 15:36.015
She doesn't want to talk to me.

15:38.021 --> 15:41.764
Guess whatever secrets lie in her past,
she wants to keep buried there.

15:56.081 --> 15:57.537

Jonathan!

16:41.001 --> 16:42.741
Jonathan, it's me!

16:43.503 --> 16:45.835
What happened? It's been two months!

16:46.756 --> 16:49.338
My friends said it was a trick,
but I said no.

16:49.426 --> 16:52.589
There must be an accident
or a misunderstanding,

16:52.721 --> 16:54.177
that I'd find out at the castle!

16:54.764 --> 16:56.265
And here you are!

16:58.602 --> 17:00.263
You are a stubborn one, aren't you?

17:09.070 --> 17:10.276
Are you

17:11.865 --> 17:13.071
a gardener?

17:13.450 --> 17:14.906
Well, I'm not Prince Jonathan.

17:15.744 --> 17:17.951
Of course, there is no Prince Jonathan.

17:18.038 --> 17:19.278
You lied to me.

17:20.040 --> 17:23.453
You took my heart, my virtue, my...

17:24.961 --> 17:26.041
My good name.

17:26.129 --> 17:27.118
I took?

17:27.464 --> 17:28.624
(LAUGHS)

17:28.965 --> 17:32.708
You practically forced it into my hands
when you thought that l was a prince.

17:33.428 --> 17:35.464
A harlot is a harlot.

17:37.224 --> 17:38.760
I'm with Child.

17:41.311 --> 17:43.302
I'm going to have a baby.

17:45.565 --> 17:48.557
There may be no Prince Jonathan,
but there is a prince,

17:48.652 --> 17:51.485
and how will he feel
when I tell him what you've done?

17:53.406 --> 17:55.613
Give me enough to support this child.

17:56.159 --> 17:57.490
You stole before, do it again...

17:57.577 --> 17:59.158
Yeah, go ahead and tell him.

17:59.287 --> 18:01.448
And good luck finding me.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.410
Guards! Guards!

18:05.502 --> 18:08.164
There's a scoundrel in the garden!
Guards! Help me!

18:08.672 --> 18:09.661
Ah!

18:20.100 --> 18:21.761
MAN: Are you all right?

18:23.103 --> 18:25.765
What happened to you?
You were calling for help.

18:27.816 --> 18:28.976
He got away.

18:30.360 --> 18:34.524
There was a bandit on the road.
He took everything I had.

18:36.116 --> 18:37.652
I'm so sorry to hear that.

18:38.159 --> 18:40.195
Come with me.
We'll do everything we can for you.

18:41.037 --> 18:43.528
There's nothing you can do for me.

18:43.623 --> 18:46.865
Allow me to try. I'm Prince Leopold.

18:56.845 --> 18:58.381
Thank you, Your Highness.

19:06.730 --> 19:07.810
Maybe Belle will have more luck.

19:07.897 --> 19:09.979
There has to be
something that can help us.

19:10.066 --> 19:11.977
Right. My magic gets more powerful
every day.

By the time this all goes down,
I'll be ready.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.493
You know what? Go ahead.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.076
I'm gonna stay and talk to Regina.

19:27.167 --> 19:28.907
I'll help clean up.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.914
I'm not in the mood for a heart-to-heart.

19:32.255 --> 19:34.997
I'm not sure
that's physically possible right now.

for the whole village to see,

20:03.828 --> 20:04.817
(CHUCKUNG)

20:04.954 --> 20:07.821

20:09.042 --> 20:11.124
Did you ever get revenge for that?

20:11.211 --> 20:12.701
That's a long-term plan.

20:12.796 --> 20:15.208
You see, there aren't that many
young people in my village,

20:15.298 --> 20:19.132
and, odds are, one of them
will end up married to me.

20:19.469 --> 20:22.211
-That should do it.
-(LAUGHS)

20:23.390 --> 20:24.971

(CHUCKLES)
It's a bit frosty, but I'm okay.

20:33.358 --> 20:36.145
Uh, I'd build a fire for you,

20:36.236 --> 20:39.603
but I'm embarrassed to say
I don't know how.

20:40.573 --> 20:41.983
I do.

20:51.668 --> 20:53.158
I'm going to be king.

20:53.336 --> 20:55.452
I gather that happens
when you're a prince.

20:56.131 --> 20:57.587
And I want to do right by that gift.

20:57.674 --> 20:59.915
I keep telling myself
I wanna be a "man of the people,"

21:00.009 --> 21:03.672
then I realize I can't even build a fire,
a task any peasant can do.

21:04.180 --> 21:06.262
Well, this peasant can fix that.

21:25.034 --> 21:28.026
See? Just have to let air get in it.

21:34.627 --> 21:38.040
When the throne becomes mine,
I'll need to provide an heir of my own.

21:38.631 --> 21:39.791
You'll have to marry.

21:39.883 --> 21:41.544
And start a family immediately.

21:43.344 --> 21:44.880
That actually sounds nice.

21:46.556 --> 21:47.887
Anyone in mind?

22:06.159 --> 22:07.399
That's tonight.

22:08.161 --> 22:09.742
You don't sound very excited.

22:10.497 --> 22:11.486
I'm sure she's

22:12.749 --> 22:13.864
a lovely choice.

22:14.250 --> 22:16.582
Well, I'm sure she is.
She's just not a choice

22:18.171 --> 22:19.411
I made.

22:23.718 --> 22:25.754
What's the use of having power

22:26.262 --> 22:28.753
if you can't choose whom to wed?

22:37.273 --> 22:38.774
I want to apologize, Regina.

For Cora, for...

Murdering her?

22:43.446 --> 22:45.061
Right. Yeah.

I don't take it lightly.
I think about it every day.

22:55.750 --> 22:57.081
So do I.

22:59.087 --> 23:01.624
And when I do think about it,

23:02.423 --> 23:04.209
I remember

23:04.968 --> 23:07.209
that she did kill your mother.

23:08.638 --> 23:10.549

a lot of her life from me.

-Mmm.
-She wasn't the warmest mother,

27:06.542 --> 27:07.793
(CHUCKLES)

27:08.795 --> 27:10.956
Magic doesn't fail.

27:12.131 --> 27:13.246
People fail.

27:14.300 --> 27:15.915
Laws only exist

27:16.302 --> 27:19.886
until they're broken
by someone superior.

27:21.057 --> 27:22.046
You?

27:22.350 --> 27:23.339
(CHUCKLES)

27:25.978 --> 27:27.934
You've deciphered
the laws of time travel.

27:29.732 --> 27:31.097
When that baby's born,

27:31.818 --> 27:35.686
I am going back to claim
the life that l deserved.

27:36.072 --> 27:38.859
And there's no reason
that you can't come with me.

27:38.950 --> 27:40.190
To find my boy.

27:43.746 --> 27:45.737
Perhaps, never give him up.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.455
REGINA: This can't be.

27:48.668 --> 27:51.501
The spell opened
a limited portal for talking.

27:53.005 --> 27:55.462
It's me. I killed Cora.

27:55.550 --> 27:56.881
She sensed my presence

27:56.968 --> 27:58.833
and found a way
to bleed through into our world.

27:58.928 --> 28:00.509
Watch out!

28:00.638 --> 28:02.720
Back down, Mother!

28:02.932 --> 28:05.139
You will answer my questions!

28:05.226 --> 28:08.468
Now, tell me,
what did you do to Zelena?

28:12.859 --> 28:13.848
(GASPS)

28:16.779 --> 28:17.814
-(WHOOSH)
-(GASPS)

28:21.075 --> 28:22.064
(GASPS)

28:24.996 --> 28:26.236
MARY: You're holding her off!

28:26.622 --> 28:28.283
But I can't hold her forever.

28:34.213 --> 28:35.498
Well, lo and behold.

28:36.215 --> 28:37.671
It turned into gold after all.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.507
How dare you!

28:40.970 --> 28:42.631
You must have
the brain the size of a pixie

28:42.722 --> 28:44.428
to show your face in this kingdom.

28:44.515 --> 28:45.755
Well, I had to see for myself

28:45.850 --> 28:48.683
if the commoner
who said "yes" to Prince Leopold

28:48.769 --> 28:50.600
was the same one who said it to me,

28:51.230 --> 28:52.345
several times.

28:53.065 --> 28:55.226
In one night. It's quite impressive.

28:55.443 --> 28:57.855
In two days, I will be a princess,

28:58.529 --> 29:00.315
and you will bow down

29:00.406 --> 29:03.022
and count yourself lucky
to pull the weeds at my feet.

29:03.117 --> 29:04.106
Oh! (CHUCKLES)

29:04.869 --> 29:07.235
Been practicing
in front of the mirror, eh?

29:07.330 --> 29:09.366
You're as much of a fraud as I ever was.

29:09.457 --> 29:11.493
My love for Prince Leopold is true,

29:12.919 --> 29:14.159
as is his for me.

29:15.338 --> 29:18.546
But does he know
how much of you there is to love?

29:19.550 --> 29:22.212
Or were you hoping
to keep our baby a secret?

29:22.553 --> 29:24.089
What is it you want?

29:24.388 --> 29:25.468
Gold? Jewels?

29:25.556 --> 29:26.636
Mmm, yes, whatever you can get.

29:27.099 --> 29:29.806
Enough for me to live happily
for the rest of my days,

29:29.894 --> 29:31.759
just like you wanted from me.

29:33.105 --> 29:35.016
Bring it here, tomorrow night,

29:35.107 --> 29:38.065
and your secret shall remain just that.

29:42.198 --> 29:43.608
It will be done.

29:43.950 --> 29:45.861
Now leave before someone sees you.

29:58.047 --> 30:00.538
WOMAN: Princess Eva,
your carriage awaits.

30:03.260 --> 30:04.511
Princess Eva?

30:05.846 --> 30:07.222
I'm coming.

30:16.357 --> 30:18.313
I don't know how much longer
I can hold her off!

30:19.485 --> 30:20.474
(GROANS)

30:20.653 --> 30:22.814
Cora, I'm sorry.

30:22.905 --> 30:24.611
Please, forgive me.

30:25.408 --> 30:26.397
(GASPS)

30:26.742 --> 30:29.700
Save your breath. Your mother was
nothing like my mother.

30:29.787 --> 30:32.153
She only understands
power and weakness.

30:32.248 --> 30:35.035
But if she wants to kill you,
she's gonna have to go through me!

30:36.502 --> 30:37.742
This isn't about you.

30:38.129 --> 30:40.996
This is about her and me!

30:43.884 --> 30:46.045
It's time for answers, Mother.

30:47.513 --> 30:49.128
What did you do to Zelena?

30:49.265 --> 30:50.254
-(GROWLS)
-(GRUNTS)

30:50.850 --> 30:52.090
No!

31:06.657 --> 31:07.646
(GASPS)

31:07.992 --> 31:08.981
My love.

31:10.202 --> 31:11.487
You frightened me.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.119
What are you doing in the Great Hall
at this hour?

31:18.836 --> 31:21.202
Well, the wedding won't plan itself,

31:21.297 --> 31:24.084
and there's endless amounts of work
to be done.

31:26.635 --> 31:28.250
Is something wrong?

31:28.345 --> 31:30.927
Word has spread throughout the castle

31:33.893 --> 31:35.679
that you are with child.

31:37.480 --> 31:38.845
(SIGHS) My love,

31:39.482 --> 31:40.722
I am so sorry

31:41.942 --> 31:45.355
for the terrible trouble
that this lie has brought upon you.

31:45.446 --> 31:47.277
Gossip means nothing to me.

31:47.740 --> 31:49.355
I've pledged to marry you, clear Cora,

31:49.450 --> 31:53.693
and I will keep that pledge
as long as I know I can trust you.

31:59.627 --> 32:00.867
There is no baby.

32:02.838 --> 32:04.169
Only my love for you.

32:05.466 --> 32:07.172
PRINCESS EVA: You only love yourself.

32:09.345 --> 32:10.630
What is she doing here?

32:11.055 --> 32:13.717
Princess Eva is here because
she overheard your rendezvous

32:14.141 --> 32:15.301
in the garden yesterday.

32:16.102 --> 32:17.763
And just as I said,

32:18.104 --> 32:20.060
the miller's daughter is a worthless liar.

32:20.815 --> 32:21.895
You awful child.

32:22.358 --> 32:24.223
Yes, I was in the garden yesterday.

32:24.860 --> 32:27.021
There was a man roaming the grounds.

32:27.113 --> 32:29.900
I feared he might steal something,
so I made him leave.

32:30.407 --> 32:33.149
Whatever else Eva has told you

32:33.744 --> 32:37.111
is the invention of a jealous brat
who would say anything to marry you.

32:37.873 --> 32:38.953
Check her pockets.

32:52.847 --> 32:53.927
No.

32:54.014 --> 32:55.299
There's nothing left to say.

32:55.391 --> 32:57.552
You deserve better than her lies.

33:01.897 --> 33:03.762
(EXHALES SHARPLY) Leopold!

33:05.442 --> 33:06.693
Don't let me go!

33:08.320 --> 33:09.355
Come, Eva.

33:10.030 --> 33:12.692
Help me break this terrible news
to the King.

33:13.742 --> 33:15.323
Today, your heart aches,
Your Highness,

33:16.871 --> 33:18.031
but I promise,

33:18.455 --> 33:21.618
a more worthy wife will give you
the child that you deserve.

33:22.668 --> 33:24.283
One that will be pure.

33:25.963 --> 33:27.373
Pure as snow.

33:29.967 --> 33:31.423
REGINA: Mary Margaret!

33:33.971 --> 33:35.757
Hold on. I won't let you go!

33:38.058 --> 33:39.047
(GRUNTING)

33:53.991 --> 33:55.026
What the hell was that?

33:55.117 --> 33:56.357
Cora.

33:56.452 --> 33:57.487
Is she okay?

33:57.578 --> 33:58.784
Mary Margaret, can you hear me?

33:59.163 --> 34:02.030
(WEAKLY) It's Cora.
Not what we thought.

34:02.541 --> 34:03.872
She's trying to communicate.

34:03.959 --> 34:06.041
She was? What did she say?

34:06.128 --> 34:07.584
Leopold,

34:08.631 --> 34:09.916
my mother. My mother...

34:10.007 --> 34:11.963
Shh. Mary Margaret, relax.

34:12.051 --> 34:13.416
She's not making sense.
We need to call a doctor.

34:13.510 --> 34:15.125
If she knows
something that could help us...

34:15.221 --> 34:17.303
-Regina, it's gonna have to wait.
-It can't wait!

34:17.640 --> 34:18.675
If we wanna stop Zelena,

34:18.766 --> 34:20.677
we have to know
what the hell she's doing and why.

34:20.893 --> 34:22.303
I can help with half of that.

34:23.312 --> 34:24.347
What?

34:24.438 --> 34:25.939
She's planning on going back.

34:26.857 --> 34:27.972
Back in time.

34:28.609 --> 34:29.724
Are you certain?

34:30.402 --> 34:32.893
No one's ever been able
to cast a spell to go back in time.

34:33.614 --> 34:35.605
Well, clearly,
she thinks she can succeed.

34:36.200 --> 34:39.658
Hey, brains, courage, a resilient heart.

34:40.371 --> 34:44.239
Those ingredients
are in every time travel spell I've found.

34:44.333 --> 34:45.823
DAVID: But then why go back in time?

34:45.918 --> 34:48.159
I mean, we have no idea
what she's trying to accomplish.

34:48.254 --> 34:49.369
I do.

34:51.173 --> 34:52.413
She didn't...

34:52.508 --> 34:53.497
Don't push yourself.

34:54.343 --> 34:55.799
She didn't wanna give up Zelena.

34:56.887 --> 34:59.845
She was forced to by... Mmm.

35:00.933 --> 35:02.889
By my mother, Princess Eva.

35:03.352 --> 35:04.387
She told a secret,

35:06.105 --> 35:07.094
just like I did.

35:08.816 --> 35:11.307
Wait, lthought
our family were the good guys.

35:11.402 --> 35:12.437
(SIGHS)

35:12.528 --> 35:14.769
Life is too messy
for it to ever be that simple.

35:14.863 --> 35:16.603
DAVID: You're saying
if it wasn't for Snow's mother,

35:16.991 --> 35:18.856
Cora would've kept Zelena?

35:19.159 --> 35:21.992
She would've been
tutored by Rumplestiltskin.

35:22.079 --> 35:24.616
And all if it weren't
for this Princess Eva?

35:25.249 --> 35:26.284
So, that means...

35:26.375 --> 35:28.616
Zelena is going back to kill my mother.

35:30.838 --> 35:32.328
You'll have never been born.

35:32.423 --> 35:34.664
I'm guessing
this is where your help ends.

35:35.175 --> 35:36.335
Now, think it through, Miss Swan.

35:36.427 --> 35:38.759
That means
you'll have never been born.

35:38.846 --> 35:40.211
And neither will Henry.

35:41.390 --> 35:44.223
And on this different path, Regina,
you may not be either.

35:44.727 --> 35:45.842
HOOK: It's a good thing

35:45.936 --> 35:48.052
no one has ever succeeded
with this time travel nonsense.

35:48.147 --> 35:49.387
The baby.

35:49.898 --> 35:50.887
What?

35:50.983 --> 35:52.974
That's what's missing.
That's why none have succeeded.

35:53.068 --> 35:55.059
Somehow, some way,
our baby is the key.

35:55.863 --> 35:58.195
Zelena went to a lot of effort
to get close to our unborn child.

35:58.282 --> 35:59.397
That's what she's after.

35:59.491 --> 36:00.526
What is she going to do with it?

36:00.617 --> 36:02.949
It doesn't matter. She's not gonna get it.
We're gonna stop her.

36:03.037 --> 36:05.699
And since our baby's not born,
she's stuck.

36:06.123 --> 36:07.954
And we have what we need,

36:08.208 --> 36:09.243
time.

36:12.796 --> 36:14.252

For showing me
something I should've seen long ago.

37:30.457 --> 37:32.197
It's never easy
for a man to admit he's wrong.

37:34.711 --> 37:37.919
But I wronged you and hurt us both.

37:39.967 --> 37:43.585
Those mistakes can't haunt us.

My son gave his life

38:52.748 --> 38:54.488

And I can see
only one way to honor that sacrifice.

And that's by killing you.

has a surprising tolerance

she had such darkness in her past.

Well, we can never
know our past completely.

40:33.890 --> 40:37.929
If we had, I probably wouldn't have
spent so much time trying to kill you.

40:39.605 --> 40:42.267
We would have found
something to fight about. I mean,

40:43.400 --> 40:45.015
l was such a brat.

40:46.570 --> 40:48.902
-Your mother's child.
-(CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

40:51.867 --> 40:55.109
I think we've wasted our last day
being haunted by the past.

40:55.537 --> 40:58.495
Now we can focus
on being haunted by our

40:59.416 --> 41:00.781
impending lack of a future.

41:00.876 --> 41:03.913
Zelena isn't going to win.
Not with all of us united against her.

41:04.421 --> 41:06.662
Hope isn't easy
when I know she holds my heart.

41:06.923 --> 41:08.914
Which you'll get back,
stronger than ever.

41:09.009 --> 41:11.295
That's what it means
to be the most resilient.

41:11.386 --> 41:13.047
That could be
another one of her tricks, too.

41:13.263 --> 41:15.504
Regina, I've seen what
life has thrown at you.

41:15.599 --> 41:19.183
And you still fight against the darkness,
every single day.

41:19.269 --> 41:22.761
Sooner or later,
your heart will find its way to happiness.

41:23.023 --> 41:24.183
(HUFFS)

41:24.274 --> 41:25.855
That doesn't feel possible.

41:25.942 --> 41:27.352
But it is.

41:29.029 --> 41:30.235
I know you.

41:30.614 --> 41:32.900
And you feel things deeply,

41:34.284 --> 41:35.444
with or without it.

41:35.535 --> 41:38.402
You feel things with your whole soul.

41:39.122 --> 41:40.908
Don't let anything hold you back.

41:43.669 --> 41:44.658
(SIGHS)

41:50.384 --> 41:51.749
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

41:53.470 --> 41:54.755
My lady.

41:55.347 --> 41:57.929
I'm sorry, I let you down.

41:58.433 --> 42:00.515
Your heart was lost to Zelena
on my watch.

42:00.602 --> 42:03.594
But I promise you, lwill get it back.
