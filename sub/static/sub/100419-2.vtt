WEBVTT

00:11.440 --> 00:13.760
- She's gonna love it.

00:13.840 --> 00:14.880
You all right with that?

00:14.960 --> 00:16.920
Yeah. The police station's
just around the corner.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.200
Great. See you tomorrow. Thank you.

00:19.280 --> 00:20.320
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:20.400 --> 00:22.000
Oh, shall I add a balloon?

00:22.080 --> 00:24.000
Yes, a helium one, please.

00:24.080 --> 00:25.440
You know where to tie it.

00:50.280 --> 00:51.120
Bye, love!

00:52.040 --> 00:53.040
See ya.

00:57.840 --> 00:58.800
-Oh.
-Sorry.

00:59.600 --> 01:02.360
-No, it was my fault, 'cause I was--
-Hi. How are you?

01:03.160 --> 01:04.720
It's "Heidi," right? Heidi Doyle?

01:04.800 --> 01:06.600
Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.

01:07.480 --> 01:08.320
What is this?

01:08.920 --> 01:10.480
FindYourSugarBaby.com.

01:11.040 --> 01:12.040
What?

01:12.400 --> 01:16.240
Well, it's a site for men
with disposable income,

01:16.320 --> 01:18.000
and they're set up with sugar babies.

01:18.640 --> 01:19.840
I'm sorry.

01:19.920 --> 01:21.800
What is this? Who are you?

01:21.880 --> 01:22.920
How'd you know my name?

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
The men are usually in their 40s to 60s.

01:26.080 --> 01:27.080
They make a selection,

01:27.160 --> 01:29.760
and if the young women
are interested, they, uh...

01:30.360 --> 01:31.720
open negotiations.

01:32.320 --> 01:34.760
Let's say the man wants
to spend time with a woman

01:34.840 --> 01:36.760
five times in a month on particular days

01:36.840 --> 01:38.480
away from home when he's free,

01:38.560 --> 01:39.400
as it were.

01:39.560 --> 01:42.840
He may offer her a thousand pounds
a month, she asks for two,

01:42.920 --> 01:45.040
they settle on 1,300
and draw up an agreement.

01:45.680 --> 01:47.120
It's all in there.

01:48.080 --> 01:50.600
You can read all their correspondence.
It covers everything,

01:50.680 --> 01:53.480
-even non-insistence on condom use--
-All right, stop this.

01:53.960 --> 01:55.800
Why are you telling me this?
What do you want?

01:55.880 --> 01:57.800
Well, I want you to know what's going on.

01:58.440 --> 01:59.960
If someone you love is lying to you,

02:00.040 --> 02:01.880
we think you deserve to know the truth.

02:02.480 --> 02:04.800
After all those years of devotion,
you've earned it.

02:05.600 --> 02:06.920
It's your right to know.

02:10.040 --> 02:11.160
I'll kill him.

02:11.800 --> 02:13.040
-Sorry?
-Ian.

02:13.880 --> 02:15.000
My husband.

02:15.080 --> 02:17.160
Twenty-three years
I've been with that bastard.

02:17.240 --> 02:19.520
We're not talking
about your husband, Heidi.

02:21.600 --> 02:22.440
What?

02:22.520 --> 02:23.920
We're talking about your daughter.

02:26.560 --> 02:27.400
Kimberley.

02:29.160 --> 02:31.080
She's got three men on the go
at the moment.

02:31.160 --> 02:32.160
But listen.

02:33.160 --> 02:36.160
Pay us 10,000 pounds
in the next three days...

02:37.080 --> 02:40.040
and no one ever hears of this,
not even your husband, Ian.

02:40.640 --> 02:42.040
Know what? I'm going to the police.

02:43.240 --> 02:44.160
Yeah, you can do that.

02:44.680 --> 02:46.960
Yeah, watch me. I'm going to.

02:47.040 --> 02:48.520
Yeah, of course you can.

02:49.200 --> 02:50.840
But if you fail to pay,

02:50.920 --> 02:55.080
your daughter's FindYourSugarBaby pages,
her pictures, her video clips,

02:55.160 --> 02:57.800
her name, everything, goes viral.

02:58.360 --> 03:00.280
Her career is over before it's even begun.

03:01.160 --> 03:02.600
And if she's vetted by an employer...

03:04.520 --> 03:05.840
this'll pop up.

03:07.240 --> 03:08.880
She won't even get interviews.

03:13.520 --> 03:14.800
Ten thousand pounds.

03:15.800 --> 03:16.680
It's all in there.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.920
Come on, Corinne, we don't do this, do we?

04:39.800 --> 04:40.800
We talk.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.280
This is so unlike you.

04:45.880 --> 04:46.960
Just, um...

04:47.040 --> 04:48.000
Just ring me.

04:49.800 --> 04:51.400
Ring me so that I know you're okay.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.280
Whatever this is, we can...

04:54.920 --> 04:56.440
sort it out together.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.160
Just call me.

05:10.000 --> 05:10.920
- Oh, cheers.
-Oi!

05:11.440 --> 05:12.400
Ahh!

05:13.000 --> 05:13.960
Come on.

05:15.560 --> 05:17.000
-Oh, Dad!
-Ryan, grow up.

05:17.080 --> 05:18.680
- Dad, where's Mom?
-Uh...

05:18.760 --> 05:20.720
I don't know.
Maybe she went into school early.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.760
-Are you going into work today?
-Uh, yeah.

05:22.840 --> 05:24.280
D-Day on the Killane case.

05:24.360 --> 05:26.600
Meeting at the council offices. Why?

05:27.520 --> 05:28.360
Just wondered.

05:28.440 --> 05:29.480
See ya.

05:29.560 --> 05:30.560
Yeah, bye.

05:32.560 --> 05:35.080
Hey, um, maybe Mom's doing
breakfast club this morning.

05:35.880 --> 05:37.040
Uh...

05:37.120 --> 05:38.120
Yep, she is.

05:38.640 --> 05:40.560
She's probably
in the school cafeteria right now.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.640
Well, see you later, Dad.

05:44.240 --> 05:45.640
Hey, Ryan, do you want a lift?

05:45.720 --> 05:47.600
-To school?
-Yeah.

05:54.080 --> 05:57.120
Okay, Dad's out all day so we'll come back
later and get rid of the head.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.760
Hang on. He's leaving. We can do it now.

05:59.680 --> 06:01.040
No, no, can't. Sorry.

06:01.600 --> 06:04.800
-I'm not giving my dad a lift.
-Hey, wait! I want a lift! Oh, come on!

06:04.880 --> 06:06.960
Come on, you have to have seen me!

06:07.040 --> 06:08.320
'Course he did.

06:09.040 --> 06:11.640
Darling, who's gonna wanna
give you a lift, dressed like that?

06:11.720 --> 06:12.640
Dressed like what?

06:13.160 --> 06:14.560
Usain Bolt wears these.

06:14.960 --> 06:16.360
On Usain Bolt, fine.

06:16.920 --> 06:17.840
On you...

06:18.280 --> 06:20.280
just hope those in-built briefs
are intact.

06:20.640 --> 06:22.680
Not that you'd frighten the horses
if they're not.

06:22.760 --> 06:24.240
Oh, hang on. Adam?

06:25.120 --> 06:27.160
Adam, is, uh, is Corinne still here?

06:27.240 --> 06:28.520
Only I'm looking for a lift.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.960
Uh... uh, no, she's not. Sorry.

06:31.040 --> 06:32.520
Uh...

06:32.600 --> 06:34.560
-No worries, I'll get a cab.
-I'm going that way.

06:34.640 --> 06:35.800
-Really?
-Yeah.

06:35.880 --> 06:37.360
Oh, mate, I owe you one.

06:37.800 --> 06:40.360
Farewell, my love.
Can I throw this in the boot?

06:40.440 --> 06:42.400
-Footballs?
-Lunch.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.880
Last night's chicken jalfrezi.

06:50.040 --> 06:52.000
Best sandwich ever.

06:53.400 --> 06:55.400
-Do you want one?
-You're okay, mate.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.640
-That stinks.

06:59.720 --> 07:00.840
Stinks like heaven.

07:01.360 --> 07:04.160
Oh, what time
did Corinne go in this morning?

07:04.240 --> 07:06.240
-I didn't see her car.
-Yeah, I know, she...

07:07.160 --> 07:09.480
Early bird.
She's doing the breakfast club.

07:09.560 --> 07:14.120
I heartily approve
but 8:30 till 3:00 is enough for me.

07:14.960 --> 07:16.880
That's what gets you
"Teacher of the Year" award.

07:16.960 --> 07:18.480
Eh? Where was she last night?

07:18.560 --> 07:19.680
What happened?

07:19.760 --> 07:22.040
Pupils give you the top prize
and you don't show.

07:22.120 --> 07:23.160
Watch me miss that.

07:23.240 --> 07:24.720
Watch me get that.

07:25.240 --> 07:27.040
Not prying or anything, you know,

07:27.120 --> 07:28.840
if I'm sticking my nose in
just tell me to--

07:28.920 --> 07:30.560
No, no, it's, you know, she's...

07:31.440 --> 07:32.280
Stomach cramps.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.160
Oh, mate.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.440
Put me off my sandwich, why don't you?

07:38.440 --> 07:40.960
Right. Let's see what you're listening to.

each other's business?

08:28.080 --> 08:29.000
Who told you?

08:29.640 --> 08:31.200
Told me what? What do you mean?

08:31.280 --> 08:32.440
Do you know where she is?

08:33.160 --> 08:34.280
Did she stay at yours?

08:35.000 --> 08:35.840
Who?

08:36.440 --> 08:38.640
Corinne. She didn't come home last night.

08:38.880 --> 08:41.320
No. I'm just covering her breakfast club.

08:42.560 --> 08:44.160
Vicky, what is it?

08:44.880 --> 08:45.920
Not here.

08:52.120 --> 08:52.960
Hey.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.120
I... I don't know what to do,
and I should,

08:58.200 --> 09:00.120
'cause I'm her mom, and if I don't know--

09:00.200 --> 09:02.360
Whoa, wait.
What are we talking about here?

09:02.440 --> 09:03.560
It's Ella.

09:04.080 --> 09:07.240
-Ella?
-The photos from Ella's phone

09:07.680 --> 09:09.160
have been posted online by someone.

09:09.240 --> 09:11.000
Close-up photos of...

09:11.400 --> 09:12.360
her privates.

09:13.040 --> 09:13.960
What?

09:14.040 --> 09:15.800
-Whoa, okay, hey.

09:16.760 --> 09:18.200
What do I do, though?

09:18.280 --> 09:20.920
You know, I've taken the photos down
but if they've been shared,

09:21.000 --> 09:23.080
then they're out there,
so how do I protect her?

09:23.760 --> 09:25.920
You say someone else posted these?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.920
Yeah, but they were sent from her phone.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.760
Right, well, Ella's 14,

09:29.840 --> 09:33.080
so this would be considered child abuse.
You're gonna have to go to the police.

09:33.920 --> 09:35.440
Ella says the photos aren't of her.

09:35.520 --> 09:37.800
Someone's claiming they are,
someone's done this to her.

09:39.240 --> 09:40.960
Uh... All right, look...

09:41.560 --> 09:43.320
This is a family lawyer.

09:43.400 --> 09:46.120
Why don't you give her a call first?

09:47.080 --> 09:48.400
Thanks.

09:50.320 --> 09:52.400
And Corinne's where, sorry?

09:53.120 --> 09:54.640
She's not missed school since...

09:55.120 --> 09:56.360
since she lost the baby.

09:57.720 --> 10:00.720
Sorry. I know that's not something
I should just casually refer to.

10:00.800 --> 10:01.880
It's fine.

10:02.280 --> 10:03.120
Where is she?

10:06.960 --> 10:07.800
Uh...

10:10.240 --> 10:11.880
That's it, I, uh...

10:12.800 --> 10:13.720
I have no idea.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.120
I don't know.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.680
All I've got is this...

10:17.440 --> 10:20.400
text saying that she needs time.

10:20.960 --> 10:21.800
Okay.

10:22.640 --> 10:24.040
She texted me as well last night.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.440
What, she texted you? What did she say?

10:26.520 --> 10:27.800
That she won't be in today.

10:27.880 --> 10:29.800
Show me. Show me.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.080
I don't have my phone on me.

10:31.160 --> 10:32.360
But it was just that.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.560
That's what staff do when they need cover.

10:36.440 --> 10:39.200
-I know you two have been having issues.
-What?

10:39.760 --> 10:42.400
-I don't wanna get in the middle.
-She said we've been having issues?

10:42.480 --> 10:44.960
Sorry, Vicky, Olivia's being sick,

10:45.040 --> 10:46.360
like, constantly and everywhere.

10:46.440 --> 10:47.920
- I'll be right with you.
-Okay.

10:49.360 --> 10:50.440
I have to go.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.640
Vicky...

10:53.440 --> 10:54.840
do you know something that I don't?

10:55.760 --> 10:57.520
No. I don't.

11:07.280 --> 11:08.960
It's okay. Come, Olivia.

11:09.120 --> 11:10.200
I'll call your mom.

11:16.960 --> 11:18.240
Can you help out Dante?

11:20.400 --> 11:21.840
You guys helping out Dante?

11:36.320 --> 11:37.160
Good morning.

11:37.240 --> 11:38.880
<i>Definitely could be</i>
<i>for you, yeah.</i>

11:38.960 --> 11:41.520
You've, um, had a gift-wrapped delivery.

11:42.480 --> 11:43.800
Could be something edible.

11:43.880 --> 11:44.840
Should I have a look?

11:44.920 --> 11:46.720
Thank you, no, leave it.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.000
It's got a balloon attached.

11:48.080 --> 11:49.480
<i>Leave it, all right?</i>

11:49.560 --> 11:50.560
<i>Is this why you called?</i>

11:50.640 --> 11:51.920
Oh, no, no.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.320
Katz has just handed me the hospital
toxicology report on Dante Gunnarsson.

11:55.840 --> 11:56.760
I'm looking at him.

11:56.840 --> 11:59.080
<i>Okay, well,</i>
<i>he must've been partying that night,</i>

11:59.160 --> 12:02.800
because aside from the nine units
of alcohol and cannabis in his system,

12:02.880 --> 12:04.920
he's also tested positive for MDMA.

12:05.840 --> 12:07.280
Oh, has he?

12:07.360 --> 12:11.000
So much for the parental, "He only smokes
home-grown weed in moderation."

12:11.720 --> 12:13.480
<i>Maybe they're cooking up Mandy as well.</i>

12:13.560 --> 12:14.600
Yeah.

12:14.680 --> 12:17.080
<i>We need to find out what Dante</i>
<i>was up to that night.</i>

12:17.160 --> 12:19.680
I'm heading to see how the tech team
are doing with his phone.

12:19.760 --> 12:21.960
<i>Good, yeah, anything</i>
<i>that lets us know where he was</i>

12:22.040 --> 12:23.760
<i>and who he was with.</i>

12:23.840 --> 12:24.760
Yeah.

12:28.480 --> 12:30.840
We'll have to be quick
so they don't miss us at school.

12:39.960 --> 12:43.080
-We could just take it down to the dump.
-They've got CCTV all over that place.

12:51.560 --> 12:52.960
What the fuck are you doing?

12:56.200 --> 12:57.440
Oh, it stinks.

12:57.520 --> 12:59.640
- What the...?
-That's a fucking llama!

12:59.720 --> 13:00.800
Alpaca.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.680
Why have you got a llama head in here?

13:02.760 --> 13:03.720
Alpaca, actually.

13:03.800 --> 13:05.360
Because after the rave the other night,

13:05.440 --> 13:07.480
this clown starts throwing stones
at my window.

13:08.240 --> 13:09.200
<i>When I look out...</i>

13:11.800 --> 13:14.280
...he's off his face more than
you can believe, holding that up.

13:14.760 --> 13:16.120
But why is it here?

13:16.640 --> 13:19.800
'Cause he couldn't go home.
Really, you have no idea how bad he was.

13:19.880 --> 13:21.000
-He had to stay here.
-Okay.

13:21.440 --> 13:22.440
Why is it still here?

13:22.520 --> 13:24.680
That's what we're trying to sort,
how to get rid of it.

13:28.640 --> 13:30.720
Mike? What? What is it?

13:32.320 --> 13:33.880
What are you doing?

13:40.880 --> 13:42.920
Bloody hell. You both looked weird.

13:43.480 --> 13:44.320
That was...

13:44.720 --> 13:47.120
That was like the other night,
like whatever I took

13:47.200 --> 13:49.280
is still in my system.

13:50.200 --> 13:52.880
Like, someone must've
spiked my drink or something.

13:54.080 --> 13:55.200
No, I was in Crazyville.

13:55.280 --> 13:57.760
Yes, from mixing weed and vodka.

13:57.840 --> 13:58.880
I've seen you like that.

13:58.960 --> 14:00.800
-No, never, not like that.
-Yeah.

14:01.200 --> 14:02.680
I saw you have a go at Dante.

14:04.200 --> 14:05.520
And I saw you going off with him.

14:05.600 --> 14:07.880
Okay, can we deal with what we're gonna do
with this head?

14:07.960 --> 14:08.960
-Oh no!
-What?

14:09.040 --> 14:10.040
My dad.

14:32.440 --> 14:33.800
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:36.400 --> 14:37.640
What is your mum doing?

14:38.480 --> 14:40.840
It's just some yoga gardening thing.

14:41.160 --> 14:43.160
Well, my dad's gonna see us
if we stay here.

14:44.200 --> 14:45.720
Gotta get rid of that head today.

15:09.360 --> 15:11.920
<i>Hello, you've reached</i>
<i>the Prices' family phone.</i>

15:12.000 --> 15:14.360
-If you'd like to leave a message for--
-Ryan!

15:14.760 --> 15:16.600
-Ow!
-Oh, come on, please.

15:16.680 --> 15:19.440
-Why do I have to be last anyway?
-Because you're the little one.

15:19.520 --> 15:21.400
But why have a landline anyway?

15:21.480 --> 15:22.920
Boys! Boys!

15:23.000 --> 15:23.880
Very...!

15:24.560 --> 15:26.520
Ow! Hey! What are you doing?!

15:26.600 --> 15:28.640
Because it hurts, doesn't it? Exactly.

15:28.720 --> 15:29.640
Now stop, please.

15:29.720 --> 15:32.040
Come on,
it's one little thing I ask you to do.

15:33.320 --> 15:35.600
Hello. You've reached
the Prices' family phone.

15:35.680 --> 15:37.200
if you'd like to leave a message for...

15:37.280 --> 15:38.120
-Adam.
-Corinne.

15:38.200 --> 15:39.840
-Thomas.
-Or Ryan.

15:39.920 --> 15:41.600
...you can do so after the beep.

15:41.680 --> 15:42.840
-Beep!

15:42.920 --> 15:44.400
-See?
-Easy.

15:44.480 --> 15:45.960
Now this, this is a family phone.

15:46.040 --> 15:48.960
Because whether you like it or not,
we are a family!

15:49.040 --> 15:49.920
That was great.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.520
-Oh, stop it!

15:52.600 --> 15:53.720
Oh, my God!

16:00.440 --> 16:01.400
<i>If I were you...</i>

16:02.400 --> 16:04.760
I'd run DNA checks on your two boys.

16:08.960 --> 16:10.200
Sure, sure. One moment.

16:11.760 --> 16:12.920
Yep.

16:14.720 --> 16:15.560
Hi.

16:16.120 --> 16:17.160
Do you sell...

16:17.840 --> 16:20.480
-DNA kits, testing kits?
-We do, yeah.

16:45.920 --> 16:46.960
What about the boys?

16:47.040 --> 16:48.560
-The boys?
-Are they mine?

16:59.960 --> 17:01.720
-Are they mine?
-Yes!

17:01.800 --> 17:03.920
How can you even ask me that?

17:13.600 --> 17:14.800
<i>There was this woman.</i>

17:15.280 --> 17:16.560
Suzanne Hope.

17:16.920 --> 17:18.200
So she faked a pregnancy?

17:41.480 --> 17:43.360
-Hey.
-Hey.

17:43.440 --> 17:44.320
What's up?

17:44.800 --> 17:47.640
Nothing. I've just got a meeting
with the developers at the town hall.

17:48.320 --> 17:50.640
It's, you know, procedural, legal stuff.

17:50.720 --> 17:51.680
Yeah, you told me.

17:52.720 --> 17:54.160
This is the big one with the council.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.080
Yeah.

17:55.520 --> 17:57.400
Well, everything's in order.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.320
So what's on your mind?

18:00.080 --> 18:01.640
I mean, it's nice to see you,

18:01.720 --> 18:04.360
but you didn't come here
just to tell me nothing, did you?

18:05.480 --> 18:06.320
No.

18:08.920 --> 18:11.680
Can you track down a woman for me?

18:11.760 --> 18:12.640
Suzanne Hope.

18:13.920 --> 18:14.840
She's...

18:15.400 --> 18:18.840
mid- to late 20s, probably lives
within a 30-mile radius of here.

18:19.360 --> 18:20.520
Who do you think I am?

18:21.560 --> 18:23.960
An ex-copper who'll do a better job
of it than I will.

18:24.800 --> 18:27.400
And not for nothing.
I'll knock today's meeting off the bill.

18:28.480 --> 18:30.200
Nah, feed your kids.

18:31.000 --> 18:31.960
Charge me.

18:32.880 --> 18:33.720
Uh...

18:34.200 --> 18:35.040
Suzanne Hope?

18:35.880 --> 18:37.360
What else do you know about her?

18:38.800 --> 18:41.680
She sometimes goes around
pretending to be pregnant.

18:42.560 --> 18:44.560
Like, eight months pregnant.
She wears a fake...

18:45.040 --> 18:45.880
bump.

18:46.640 --> 18:47.880
It's a friend of my wife.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.080
So ask your wife where she is.

18:54.160 --> 18:55.800
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

18:56.680 --> 18:58.000
And you go and save my home.

19:33.680 --> 19:35.760
-Hey--
- <i>Hello. Just the person.</i>

19:35.840 --> 19:38.840
You know that little thing you sent to me?
Does it come with a balloon?

19:39.160 --> 19:40.000
<i>Oh.</i>

19:40.720 --> 19:42.400
What is it? 'Cause I haven't seen it yet.

19:42.480 --> 19:44.880
You might wanna open that
when you're on your own.

19:44.960 --> 19:45.840
Why?

19:45.920 --> 19:47.800
No, never mind.

19:47.880 --> 19:50.720
What are you doing tonight?
'Cause I want to see you. I can drop in.

19:50.800 --> 19:53.120
Well, not before 6:00,
'cause I'm on my way up to town.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.120
<i>Oh, you going to see Kimberley?</i>

19:55.200 --> 19:56.400
Hoping to.

19:56.480 --> 19:59.880
Well, great, listen, I just need to pick
your brains later about something.

19:59.960 --> 20:02.880
-Dante's phone.
<i>-</i>Oh, Heidi, I'm gonna have to go.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.160
Where am I coming to tonight?

20:04.720 --> 20:05.920
<i>House or café?</i>

20:06.920 --> 20:08.640
Café. Come to the café.

20:08.720 --> 20:10.200
<i>Okay, love, I'll see you about 8:00.</i>

20:11.360 --> 20:12.920
-Okay, bye.
<i>-Bye.</i>

20:17.520 --> 20:19.360
Have a look at this.
He's got this weird app.

20:19.440 --> 20:21.360
It's a map without place names.

20:21.920 --> 20:23.880
There's nothing, no road numbers, nothing.

20:23.960 --> 20:26.000
But if you know the area...

20:26.720 --> 20:29.160
-That's around here.
-Have a look at this. Middle of nowhere.

20:29.600 --> 20:32.760
There's a pin drop. And less than a mile
from where that alpaca was found.

20:33.520 --> 20:35.320
There's a list of anonymous messages

20:35.400 --> 20:37.720
indicating there was something happening
three nights ago.

20:37.800 --> 20:39.040
"On our way."

20:39.120 --> 20:40.800
"Hunting you down." "I can see you."

20:41.120 --> 20:42.360
But nothing specific.

20:42.840 --> 20:45.320
Yeah, so people like us
don't know what they're on about.

20:45.800 --> 20:46.640
Hmm.

20:46.880 --> 20:49.160
Right, take us to the pin drop.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.200
Do you wanna open that box
with the balloon on it first?

20:52.280 --> 20:53.120
No thanks.

20:53.880 --> 20:55.040
Why? Have you had a look?

20:55.120 --> 20:56.040
Of course not.

21:10.880 --> 21:11.920
Edgar.

21:21.720 --> 21:24.240
Ten years ago,
cross-party councilors

21:24.320 --> 21:26.840
deemed this street
as fit for slum clearance.

21:27.600 --> 21:28.720
And now here we are,

21:28.800 --> 21:31.240
offering 240 highly desirable

21:31.320 --> 21:33.160
one, two and three bedroom apartments,

21:33.240 --> 21:34.560
twenty-five percent of which

21:35.280 --> 21:37.240
are for affordable housing,
and yet, one...

21:38.000 --> 21:39.080
one man...

21:39.160 --> 21:40.240
his client,

21:40.320 --> 21:43.520
wants to derail a better life
for 500 people for no better reason than

21:43.600 --> 21:45.640
his derelict home is his castle.

21:45.720 --> 21:46.640
My client has rights.

21:46.720 --> 21:49.520
The council issued a compulsory
purchase order against him.

21:49.600 --> 21:52.200
We will fight them and you
and your company every inch of the way.

21:52.280 --> 21:54.760
Because you have no intention
of providing affordable housing.

21:54.840 --> 21:57.720
No. Once construction starts,
you'll claim that costs are rising

21:57.800 --> 22:00.760
and that this 25 percent will shrink
to 20 percent and then ten percent--

22:00.840 --> 22:02.440
This project is properly costed.

22:02.520 --> 22:04.840
Well, thankfully,
we may never find out if that's true.

22:04.920 --> 22:05.800
Thankfully?

22:06.800 --> 22:08.040
What do you mean, "Thankfully"?

22:09.120 --> 22:10.200
The council needs this.

22:10.280 --> 22:11.720
The country needs this.

22:11.800 --> 22:13.040
More housing is everything.

22:13.120 --> 22:16.280
-A man without a home ceases to be a man.
-You're just trying to make a killing.

22:16.360 --> 22:18.560
I'm offering to empower 500 people

22:18.640 --> 22:20.840
for your single, solitary one.

22:21.440 --> 22:23.720
Please, are you doing this pro bono?
I don't think so.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.280
So how much do you charge?

22:25.360 --> 22:28.080
Your annual income
for the past three years, what's that?

22:28.160 --> 22:29.320
This is not about my salary--

22:29.400 --> 22:31.120
Are we looking at a charity here

22:31.200 --> 22:33.200
or a successful lawyer?

22:33.760 --> 22:34.720
Think I can guess.

22:44.360 --> 22:45.760
Adam, you got a moment?

22:47.640 --> 22:48.760
Why didn't you warn me?

22:49.520 --> 22:52.240
Why didn't you phone or text?
I had no idea you owned that company.

22:52.880 --> 22:55.320
-I'm a silent partner.
-Or not so silent.

22:57.320 --> 22:58.520
Dad...

22:58.600 --> 23:01.280
-That street is where I grew up, you know.
-It was a shithole then.

23:01.760 --> 23:03.800
But some of my earliest memories
are of that shithole.

23:03.880 --> 23:06.800
Okay, look, I have...
I have feelings about the place too.

23:06.880 --> 23:09.400
So don't just make a profit out of it,
give something back.

23:09.480 --> 23:11.320
Come on, Adam, you're being sentimental.

23:12.400 --> 23:14.440
Who in their right mind
would wanna live there now?

23:15.080 --> 23:16.000
Martin Killane.

23:16.560 --> 23:17.960
I said, "In their right mind."

23:19.840 --> 23:22.480
Oh, come on.
I'm offering to improve the area.

23:23.360 --> 23:25.000
How are Thomas and Ryan?

23:25.080 --> 23:26.680
If you ever called them, you'd know.

23:26.760 --> 23:28.800
Yes, well, you may never experience this,

23:28.880 --> 23:31.320
but having a second family
is very time-consuming.

23:31.400 --> 23:32.440
They're your grandsons.

23:32.880 --> 23:34.400
And my two boys are your brothers.

23:34.480 --> 23:35.440
Half brothers.

23:35.520 --> 23:36.800
When do you ever call them?

23:38.720 --> 23:40.880
-Mr. Price, car's here.

23:42.160 --> 23:45.320
Well, when all this is done,
let's try and see more of each other.

23:45.400 --> 23:48.680
All of us: Wendy, Corinne, the boys.
How is Corinne, by the way?

23:48.760 --> 23:50.200
What's she up to? Is she well?

23:51.480 --> 23:52.480
Yeah, yeah, she's fine.

23:52.880 --> 23:54.400
Good, good. I like Corinne.

23:58.480 --> 24:01.760
She updates me about Thomas and Ryan
every month, of course.

24:21.600 --> 24:22.840
Hey, Mom.

24:23.240 --> 24:24.720
Oh, are you all right?

24:25.840 --> 24:27.360
-Nice surprise.
-Yeah.

24:27.440 --> 24:29.560
-How come you're here?
-Thought you might have lectures.

24:29.640 --> 24:31.200
Oh, yeah, I have one first thing.

24:31.280 --> 24:33.600
Multicellularity and cell communication.

24:33.680 --> 24:34.960
-Oh.
-How come you're here?

24:36.720 --> 24:37.840
Nice bag, isn't it?

24:37.920 --> 24:40.280
Yeah. Is this a shopping expedition, then?

24:40.840 --> 24:42.000
-I suppose.
-Great.

24:42.080 --> 24:44.440
Well, I won four numbers
on the lottery last night,

24:44.520 --> 24:45.520
so lunch is on me.

24:45.600 --> 24:47.800
Yeah, I'm taking you out. Four out of six.

24:47.880 --> 24:51.280
So I was thinking hundreds of pounds
at least, maybe a thousand, but 62.

24:51.360 --> 24:52.920
It still buys us lunch. No arguments--

24:53.000 --> 24:54.400
What if I told you

24:54.480 --> 24:56.480
I know exactly why you can afford it?

24:57.600 --> 25:00.280
And this, as in I know everything.

25:01.280 --> 25:02.880
FindYourSugarBaby.com.

25:04.520 --> 25:06.240
Mom, that's... Listen.

25:06.320 --> 25:09.320
That's literally just old men
wanting to take young women out to dinner.

25:09.400 --> 25:10.720
Nothing beyond that happens.

25:10.800 --> 25:12.040
Oh, plenty happens.

25:15.440 --> 25:17.480
And you've got three on the go
at the moment.

25:17.560 --> 25:18.600
What does that make you?

25:18.680 --> 25:19.920
-Who showed you?
-Doesn't matter.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.200
-It does matter.
-All right.

25:21.280 --> 25:23.600
Never seen them before.
They stopped me in the street.

25:23.680 --> 25:24.880
Why? Wanting what?

25:25.360 --> 25:26.280
Ten thousand pounds.

25:26.800 --> 25:29.080
-What?
-Or all this...

25:29.160 --> 25:31.120
-...goes online

25:31.200 --> 25:33.040
for everyone to see, Kimberley.

25:33.120 --> 25:35.560
I mean, it's hidden for now,
but they've hacked the site.

25:36.520 --> 25:39.680
And if I don't pay,
where's your glorious future then?

25:40.080 --> 25:42.360
You wanna be a research scientist,
forget it.

25:42.440 --> 25:45.720
You wanna teach, you wanna get kids
excited about science...

25:46.320 --> 25:48.920
Employers screen everyone nowadays.

25:49.560 --> 25:52.080
They're all over your social media,
and this...

25:52.160 --> 25:54.080
will be all over yours.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.400
Oh, God, what have I done?

25:58.280 --> 25:59.120
Why?

25:59.560 --> 26:01.920
It just...  It got out of hand.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.760
Why'd you have to do it
in the first place?

26:03.840 --> 26:06.560
Because three years of uni
gets you 60 grand in debt.

26:06.640 --> 26:09.360
-Oh, go on.
-No, Mom, it's true, 60 grand.

26:09.440 --> 26:12.280
Which you don't have to pay
until you're earning enough.

26:12.360 --> 26:13.360
And then it's nothing.

26:13.440 --> 26:15.640
Nothing to you. It's not nothing to me.

26:17.880 --> 26:18.800
Sorry.

26:18.880 --> 26:20.880
Oh, darling.

26:20.960 --> 26:22.720
Mom, I'm so sorry.

26:26.320 --> 26:27.840
Okay, it'll be all right.

26:29.040 --> 26:30.840
I'll pay them,
they'll get their money today.

26:30.920 --> 26:31.880
From where, Mom?

26:31.960 --> 26:34.480
Oh, from the café,
from the trip fund with Johanna.

26:34.560 --> 26:36.080
No, you saved so long for that.

26:36.160 --> 26:38.840
What, you think I'm gonna
wanna do anything if this isn't fixed?

26:39.800 --> 26:41.400
Look, Mom, I will pay you back.

26:41.480 --> 26:43.440
-Mom, I will.
-No, no. No, no, no.

26:43.520 --> 26:46.040
You promise me that this stops now.

26:46.120 --> 26:48.600
I promise, it will never happen again.

26:48.680 --> 26:49.640
-Just...
-Okay?

26:49.720 --> 26:51.920
Just please, please don't tell Dad.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.640
All right, Dad will never know.

26:54.520 --> 26:55.520
This never happened.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.080
Okay?

27:00.240 --> 27:01.440
Oh, God.

27:20.040 --> 27:21.320
Here, we wanna head this way.

27:37.960 --> 27:39.160
Oh, party time.

27:40.360 --> 27:41.360
Bonfire too.

27:42.600 --> 27:44.760
This is the place. The pin drop's here.

27:46.520 --> 27:48.440
The alpaca was where from here?

27:49.000 --> 27:50.680
A mile that way.

27:50.760 --> 27:52.720
And we found Dante Gunnarsson...?

27:52.800 --> 27:54.560
That-a-way, quarter of a mile, so...

27:55.200 --> 27:57.120
bonfire, alpaca...

27:58.280 --> 27:59.160
Dante.

28:01.040 --> 28:02.880
Looks like there were
a lot of people here.

28:03.160 --> 28:04.640
How come we got no complaints?

28:09.240 --> 28:10.480
Dante's come round.

28:10.560 --> 28:12.520
Right, we're gonna need
a search team here

28:12.600 --> 28:14.080
while we go and speak to him.

28:14.760 --> 28:16.320
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>my dad was involved.</i>

28:16.400 --> 28:17.520
This is my home!

28:17.600 --> 28:19.920
He owns a lot of companies.
I didn't know he owned this one.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.720
-Why, that piece of shit!
-I know.

28:21.800 --> 28:23.520
He used to be my neighbor!

28:23.600 --> 28:25.920
It doesn't make a difference.
The law is still on your side.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.920
Him and his company
are not gonna win this.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.160
I certainly hope that's true.

28:32.400 --> 28:33.680
Come on up here.

28:33.760 --> 28:35.880
I found you your Suzanne Hope.

28:36.520 --> 28:41.280
Well, found three of them,
but only one of them was in her 20s.

28:42.280 --> 28:43.440
I've never been up here.

28:47.320 --> 28:48.400
Oh, what's all this?

28:50.240 --> 28:52.960
Oh, my wife.
Before she ran off, I couldn't stand them.

28:53.040 --> 28:55.680
Then when she left,
I kind of grew to like them.

28:56.680 --> 28:57.720
Come on in here.

29:00.280 --> 29:03.600
I still work on an odd cold case,
missing persons.

29:03.680 --> 29:04.520
Well...

29:05.080 --> 29:07.040
If there's nobody to help you
find a loved one,

29:07.120 --> 29:10.000
it's a pretty cold world out there...

29:10.840 --> 29:11.680
not knowing...

29:12.600 --> 29:14.360
why they've gone, where they are.

29:15.600 --> 29:16.640
It's the worst.

29:17.640 --> 29:18.520
So...

29:18.600 --> 29:21.840
it's good to at least be able
to give some of them a little hope.

29:22.920 --> 29:24.120
Speaking of which,

29:24.200 --> 29:25.200
here you go.

29:26.440 --> 29:27.360
Suzanne Hope.

29:28.120 --> 29:29.400
An address, anyway.

29:30.120 --> 29:31.320
-Thanks.

29:31.400 --> 29:32.240
Sorry.

29:33.160 --> 29:34.160
My youngest.

29:35.160 --> 29:36.480
Hello, mate. Has your mom called?

29:36.560 --> 29:37.400
No.

29:37.880 --> 29:39.920
And I'm locked out, Dad. I can't get in.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.840
Where is she? I'm starving.

29:41.920 --> 29:44.400
-What do you mean, you can't get in?
<i>-I don't have a key.</i>

29:44.480 --> 29:45.960
Mate, it's under the plant pot.

29:46.040 --> 29:47.160
It's not there.

29:47.600 --> 29:49.560
<i>Okay, why don't you go over to Tripp's?</i>

29:49.640 --> 29:50.960
Dad, I've got homework.

29:51.040 --> 29:52.040
<i>Three lots.</i>

29:52.880 --> 29:54.000
<i>And my books are inside,</i>

29:54.080 --> 29:56.880
and I'm hungry and I wanna go to the loo.

30:38.080 --> 30:39.360
That's Tom's girl.

30:46.680 --> 30:47.560
Excuse me.

30:47.640 --> 30:49.520
-Dante?
-Dante? Nurse?!

30:51.840 --> 30:53.600
-What's wrong with him?
-Okay, don't panic.

30:53.680 --> 30:55.080
What...? Don't... What do you mean?

30:55.160 --> 30:56.680
I think it's best if...

31:11.600 --> 31:13.280
Excuse me. Excuse me, guys.

31:13.360 --> 31:14.320
Can I have a word?

31:16.600 --> 31:18.400
Hi, I'm DS Griffin,

31:18.480 --> 31:19.920
this is DC Ross.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.360
You're Dante's friends, right?
You all go to the same school?

31:22.440 --> 31:24.080
-Yeah--
-We're not really friends.

31:24.840 --> 31:27.520
I mean, we're not best friends.

31:27.600 --> 31:30.080
We're his friends, he's our friend.
What are you talking about?

31:30.160 --> 31:31.280
It's okay. It's okay.

31:31.840 --> 31:33.400
He's in the right place now though.

31:34.160 --> 31:36.840
While we've got you,
do any of you know about a gathering

31:37.200 --> 31:38.520
the other night in the woods?

31:39.120 --> 31:41.280
Three nights ago,
the night Dante was hurt.

31:42.400 --> 31:43.600
-No.
-Sorry.

31:44.560 --> 31:47.080
Dante took a fall.
He fell quite a way, which...

31:47.800 --> 31:50.560
for us begs questions.
You know, was he on his own, or...

31:51.120 --> 31:54.040
were others around maybe involved?

31:55.160 --> 31:57.520
'Cause if there were,
this could get serious.

31:58.200 --> 32:00.360
Especially if he doesn't pull through.

32:05.440 --> 32:06.560
What else can I tell you?

32:07.240 --> 32:09.320
-Toxicology?
-Oh, yeah.

32:09.400 --> 32:11.960
Dante had... cannabis

32:12.040 --> 32:14.400
and MDMA in his system, so...

32:14.920 --> 32:17.400
any of you know,
does he do ecstasy regularly?

32:18.560 --> 32:19.560
I don't know.

32:20.680 --> 32:21.520
Okay.

32:22.440 --> 32:23.440
Have you left your names?

32:23.520 --> 32:24.360
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

32:24.440 --> 32:25.520
-Earlier.
-Yeah, earlier.

32:25.600 --> 32:26.440
Great.

32:26.880 --> 32:28.640
'Cause if we don't make enough progress,

32:28.720 --> 32:30.800
you ought to know
we'll do a blanket drug test

32:31.640 --> 32:34.000
on Dante's friends,
probably do it through school.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
Okay, cheers.

32:38.480 --> 32:39.320
Thanks.

32:45.920 --> 32:47.560
You can't drug test the whole year.

32:47.640 --> 32:48.720
I don't need to.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.880
I've got what I want.
Did you see their faces?

32:50.960 --> 32:52.320
They're hiding something.

32:56.160 --> 32:57.520
Where've you been?

32:58.360 --> 32:59.440
Hurry up, I'm starving.

32:59.520 --> 33:00.400
All right.

33:00.480 --> 33:01.560
What's for tea?

33:01.640 --> 33:02.480
Uh...

33:03.000 --> 33:04.680
I don't know. Should we get a pizza?

33:05.320 --> 33:06.680
Yeah, okay.

33:06.760 --> 33:08.120
-Card.

33:08.800 --> 33:09.880
Dad, card.

33:10.320 --> 33:11.760
-What?
-Card for pizza.

33:11.840 --> 33:12.720
Oh, yeah.

33:13.400 --> 33:14.240
Here.

33:15.040 --> 33:16.080
No anchovies, right?

33:17.280 --> 33:18.720
Get one for Thomas as well.

33:20.360 --> 33:22.320
-Hey.
-Hey, has she called?

33:22.400 --> 33:23.600
No. No, nothing.

33:24.240 --> 33:25.880
Okay. Well, look.

33:26.680 --> 33:29.400
In case you thought I wasn't
telling you something earlier...

33:29.480 --> 33:30.560
That's her text.

33:31.240 --> 33:32.080
"Won't be in."

33:32.840 --> 33:33.800
That was it.

33:37.720 --> 33:40.680
You said you knew that Corinne and I
have been having issues for a while.

33:41.280 --> 33:44.400
-Well, something's been getting to her.
-What makes you say that?

33:45.200 --> 33:47.280
She's been tense
these last few weeks, you know?

33:47.360 --> 33:49.920
Looking like, I don't know...
like you, now.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.120
Stressed.

33:52.400 --> 33:53.880
Have you called the police?

33:53.960 --> 33:57.240
And tell them what? She sent a message
saying that she needed a few days.

33:57.320 --> 33:58.880
You don't know why she said that?

34:00.520 --> 34:02.320
-Sorry.
-No, it's...

34:05.280 --> 34:07.520
Did you call that lawyer about Ella?

34:09.000 --> 34:12.320
I'm worried that once I start the process,
it'll run away with itself

34:12.400 --> 34:14.320
and make things even worse for Ella.

34:15.480 --> 34:17.440
So, still thinking it over.

34:18.280 --> 34:19.200
Hey, though,

34:19.280 --> 34:22.240
if you wanna come over anytime
to talk or whatever,

34:22.880 --> 34:23.880
just come.

34:24.480 --> 34:25.360
Okay.

34:27.160 --> 34:28.120
Thanks.

34:28.200 --> 34:29.160
Oi, oi.

34:29.240 --> 34:32.000
-Your secret's safe with me.
- Cheers, Vicky.

34:34.600 --> 34:36.800
Daisy, want a lift home?

34:36.880 --> 34:37.760
No thanks.

34:37.840 --> 34:39.200
What time will you be back?

34:39.280 --> 34:40.280
I don't know, Mom.

34:40.360 --> 34:43.120
Not now, not soon, not late.

34:43.200 --> 34:46.560
Oi! Hey, Mike, I was expecting a lift
from you this morning.

34:46.640 --> 34:49.160
Yeah, and I was expecting my dad
to wear trousers.

35:02.840 --> 35:05.800
Okay, I think I might have found a way
to get rid of that alpaca head.

35:05.880 --> 35:06.800
Yeah, no, shh.

35:07.640 --> 35:10.280
"Urine tests show cannabis for 13 days."

35:10.360 --> 35:12.120
What about
what it was I was spiked with?

35:12.200 --> 35:14.760
-At least you'll find out what it was.
-We know: weed and vodka.

35:14.840 --> 35:16.000
Oh, f...

35:16.080 --> 35:17.440
Daisy, why are you even here?

35:17.520 --> 35:19.680
I might have found a way
to get the police off your back.

35:20.400 --> 35:21.640
But if you're not interested...

35:23.800 --> 35:25.320
Okay, so I'm thinking,

35:25.400 --> 35:28.160
we link it to this,
which was five miles away, two months ago.

35:28.240 --> 35:29.200
So...

35:30.560 --> 35:33.120
We bury the head in the woods
surrounded by satanic symbols.

35:34.880 --> 35:35.760
Like this.

35:57.480 --> 35:58.600
God's sake.

36:06.640 --> 36:08.520
Ohh.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.840
-Ha!

36:15.560 --> 36:16.480
Look at this.

36:19.200 --> 36:22.800
It's an erect penis,
in case you haven't seen one before.

36:30.040 --> 36:30.880
Oh.

36:31.600 --> 36:33.600
I'm on Dante's anonymous app,

36:33.680 --> 36:36.120
and these have just started moving.

36:38.600 --> 36:41.480
It's like GeoZilla or Glympse.

36:42.560 --> 36:43.960
It shows locations of friends,

36:44.040 --> 36:46.080
except this one doesn't show
who you're looking at.

36:47.480 --> 36:49.240
Maybe the colors tell you who they are.

36:51.320 --> 36:52.600
Where was it from here?

36:53.320 --> 36:55.680
So we're close enough
for the police to make a connection.

36:58.080 --> 36:59.200
Further on.

37:06.040 --> 37:07.200
Listen, babe, I'm here.

37:07.960 --> 37:10.440
Yeah, I've gotta go. I'll call you later.

37:10.880 --> 37:12.680
I love you. Bye.

37:14.840 --> 37:17.000
Home. You, home, come on.

37:17.080 --> 37:18.800
-I can finish this.
-Are you sure?

37:18.880 --> 37:20.560
Yeah, go home. I'll do the accounts.

37:21.200 --> 37:22.560
I like to do it.

38:16.960 --> 38:18.440
-Hi.
-Yeah.

38:19.520 --> 38:22.440
Sorry, I'm looking for Suzanne Hope.

38:23.120 --> 38:24.400
You're looking for my wife?

38:25.440 --> 38:26.840
Yeah, but, um...

38:27.440 --> 38:29.000
-She's not in.
-No, you don't understand.

38:29.080 --> 38:30.160
Your wife knew my wife.

38:32.440 --> 38:33.560
Corinne Price.

38:33.640 --> 38:34.720
They met maybe--

38:35.080 --> 38:36.960
-You fuck!
-Fuck are you doing?

38:37.040 --> 38:38.920
-You fucking...!

38:39.000 --> 38:41.120
Stop it! Stop! Stop!

38:41.200 --> 38:43.240
-Stop!

38:43.320 --> 38:45.160
Stay away from my family! Do you hear me?!

38:46.040 --> 38:47.560
Get inside. Get inside.

38:52.760 --> 38:54.080
Suzanne!

38:57.160 --> 38:58.880
I just wanna talk to you about my wife.

38:59.840 --> 39:02.440
- Oi, I'm calling the police.

39:04.200 --> 39:05.640
Call the fucking police.

39:08.520 --> 39:11.600
-Hello, mate.
<i>-Dad? Dad, come home now.</i>

39:11.680 --> 39:13.680
-Why? What's happened?
<i>-The police are here!</i>

40:01.760 --> 40:03.160
Uh, no, we're not open tonight.

40:03.240 --> 40:04.080
Police.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.880
Hi. Mrs. Doyle.

40:11.960 --> 40:13.920
Is this about Kimberley?
Has something happened?

40:14.000 --> 40:15.520
-Your daughter's absolutely fine.
-Oh.

40:16.280 --> 40:18.080
But we do need to talk about Kimberley.

40:18.720 --> 40:19.960
Okay. Um...

40:20.360 --> 40:22.360
I'm sorry, I didn't really see your ID.

40:22.440 --> 40:24.920
I'm with the CCU, the Cyber Crime Unit.

40:26.200 --> 40:27.320
-Cyber crime?
-Yeah.

40:27.400 --> 40:30.800
We're looking into a website
called FindYourSugarBaby.com.

40:30.880 --> 40:31.720
Oh, no.

40:32.120 --> 40:34.920
Look, I don't think I should speak to you
without a solicitor.

40:35.760 --> 40:37.720
Mrs. Doyle, we're not interested
in your daughter.

40:37.800 --> 40:40.200
As far as we're concerned,
Kimberley's a victim in all of this.

40:40.280 --> 40:42.120
Yeah, well, people won't understand that.

40:42.200 --> 40:44.120
The second this goes public,
her life is ruined.

40:44.200 --> 40:46.400
Yes, but we will guarantee her anonymity.

40:46.480 --> 40:47.600
You have my word on that.

40:47.680 --> 40:51.160
I'm interested in finding the people
that put this site out there, okay?

40:51.240 --> 40:53.280
People that are using young women
like Kimberley,

40:53.360 --> 40:54.560
as bait for blackmail.

40:55.440 --> 40:57.400
Which is something
you know all about, of course.

40:58.200 --> 41:00.560
Can you tell me how
they first made contact with you?

41:01.880 --> 41:06.280
I was leaving here and two women
approached me in the car park.

41:06.360 --> 41:07.280
Two women?

41:07.680 --> 41:08.560
Yeah.

41:08.880 --> 41:11.280
-How would you describe them?
-Uh, they were...

41:11.720 --> 41:13.800
young, 20s, pretty.

41:14.120 --> 41:16.800
One had a baseball cap,
one had blond hair.

41:17.360 --> 41:19.720
It was just a setup.
Look, they gave me this.

41:24.480 --> 41:25.600
Thank you.

41:25.680 --> 41:26.520
Ta.

41:46.680 --> 41:48.120
How'd you know I'd been blackmailed?

41:48.760 --> 41:50.760
Oh, we spoke with Kimberley.

41:52.360 --> 41:53.200
When?

41:54.560 --> 41:55.520
This morning.

41:55.920 --> 41:56.800
Oh.

42:03.120 --> 42:05.800
Yeah, I'm gonna call my husband
because I said I'd ring.

42:05.880 --> 42:07.800
Can you not make phone calls
until we've finished?

42:07.880 --> 42:10.720
Well, no, he'll think that's really odd.
If I don't call him now--

42:10.800 --> 42:12.440
-Yeah.
-Would you give that back?

42:12.520 --> 42:14.040
-When we're finished.
-Give it back!

42:19.720 --> 42:20.880
Think this will work?

42:20.960 --> 42:22.960
You bury the head,
I'll make it look satanic.

42:26.120 --> 42:27.120
Can you be quiet?

42:28.800 --> 42:29.920
Okay, tip it in.

42:35.440 --> 42:38.320
Fuck.

42:38.400 --> 42:39.760
What's actually wrong with you?

42:39.840 --> 42:40.920
I don't like the dark.

42:41.560 --> 42:42.400
All right.

42:44.400 --> 42:45.240
Close your eyes.

42:46.160 --> 42:48.000
-It's still gonna be dark.
-Just breathe.

42:57.760 --> 42:58.600
There you go.

43:02.040 --> 43:03.440
Perks of having a small brain.

43:03.880 --> 43:06.480
He's always been able to do that. Okay.

43:15.760 --> 43:16.640
So...

43:17.640 --> 43:18.960
the other night with Dante...

43:19.520 --> 43:20.480
I mean...

43:21.080 --> 43:22.760
-did anything happen? Did you--?
-Shh!

43:23.560 --> 43:24.560
Turn the torch off.

43:25.160 --> 43:26.120
What?

43:29.440 --> 43:30.680
Run!

44:13.560 --> 44:14.400
Hi.

44:15.320 --> 44:16.440
We spoke earlier.

44:17.240 --> 44:18.160
Oh.

44:18.760 --> 44:19.880
No sign of your friends?

44:21.200 --> 44:22.440
Do you want Wes to take that?

44:55.200 --> 44:56.120
What's going on?

44:56.200 --> 44:59.440
You're gonna sit down,
we're gonna continue our conversation.

45:11.040 --> 45:13.640
-In your own time.
-Who are you? What do you want?

45:13.720 --> 45:16.760
You're gonna tell me everything
about the two women who gave you that.

45:18.160 --> 45:19.280
-No.
-No?

45:19.800 --> 45:22.200
You know why? Because I know
you never spoke to Kimberley.

45:22.280 --> 45:24.080
So get the fuck out of my café.

45:33.920 --> 45:34.880
Be quiet.

45:36.600 --> 45:39.760
Shut the fuck up or I will finish you off

45:39.840 --> 45:41.720
and then I'll go start
with your Kimberley.

45:47.200 --> 45:48.160
Thank you.

45:49.320 --> 45:51.640
Now, tell me about the lady
with the baseball cap.

46:01.400 --> 46:02.400
Jason?

46:03.040 --> 46:04.280
What is it? What's wrong?

46:05.520 --> 46:07.080
We need to know where Corinne is.

46:07.480 --> 46:09.040
No one wants to take this further.

46:10.960 --> 46:12.280
Go to your room, mate.

46:14.160 --> 46:15.600
It's okay. I'll be up in a minute.

46:20.880 --> 46:22.080
Take what further?

46:22.560 --> 46:25.200
A substantial sum of money's
been stolen from the football club.

46:25.280 --> 46:26.880
We need to talk to her about it.

47:08.280 --> 47:09.960
Katz. Good.

47:10.560 --> 47:11.600
Just the man we need.
