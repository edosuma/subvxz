01:21.667 --> 01:23.633
Oh, yeah.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.434
Aw, yeah.

01:38.667 --> 01:41.133
Excuse me, miss.

01:41.167 --> 01:44.767
Is this man
bothering you?

01:50.934 --> 01:54.800
Bud, I warned you
about eating all that cheese.

01:57.367 --> 01:58.600
Where are
the old people?

01:58.634 --> 02:00.233
Oh, uh...

02:00.267 --> 02:04.600
well, Dad's down at, uh...
the store.

02:05.467 --> 02:07.333
They're having that, uh,
midnight sale.

02:07.367 --> 02:09.400
You know, you probably heard it
on the radio.

02:09.434 --> 02:10.900
They keep playing
that old song:

02:10.934 --> 02:13.800
<i>After Midnight We're Gonna Sell
A Lot Of Shoes.</i>

02:15.300 --> 02:16.733
Work's a bummer.

02:16.767 --> 02:19.834
I'm glad I'm a pretty girl,
so I'll never have to.

02:20.634 --> 02:22.567
Oh, that reminds me,
where's Mom?

02:22.601 --> 02:24.166
Oh, uh, she went
to pick him up.

02:24.200 --> 02:26.867
We got a call. Something about
him flipping out.

02:36.901 --> 02:38.333
* After midnight *

02:38.367 --> 02:41.201
* We're gonna sell
A lot of shoes *

02:42.133 --> 02:43.133
Hi, Daddy.

02:43.167 --> 02:44.133
Hello, miss.

02:44.167 --> 02:46.700
You wanna buy
a lot of shoes?

02:46.734 --> 02:49.133
Uh, I have shoes,
Daddy.

02:49.167 --> 02:51.500
Uh, he doesn't
recognize you, honey.

02:51.534 --> 02:53.066
Shoes?

02:53.100 --> 02:55.633
Come on, sweetheart.
Sit down over here.

02:55.667 --> 02:57.600
Uh, we're home now,
sweetie.

02:57.634 --> 02:58.966
You remember.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.767
Two kids, a dog,

03:00.801 --> 03:04.667
a room upstairs
where you disappoint your wife.

03:07.067 --> 03:10.600
Well, there's only one way
to snap him out of this.

03:17.434 --> 03:20.301
That's how
I like to see you.

03:20.634 --> 03:23.333
Oh, Peg,
it was horrible.

03:23.367 --> 03:26.333
Sixteen straight hours
of shoe-selling mayhem.

03:26.367 --> 03:28.700
Last thing I remember,
I was down on one knee,

03:28.734 --> 03:31.734
waiting on an overflowing
glacier of a woman.

03:32.934 --> 03:34.266
The first thing they teach you

03:34.300 --> 03:35.867
when you're
a rookie shoe salesman

03:35.901 --> 03:39.834
is when you got a fat one
in the chair, never look up.

03:39.868 --> 03:42.700
I looked up, Peg.

03:42.734 --> 03:45.301
I saw underwear.

03:46.567 --> 03:49.934
It said, "Saturday."

03:51.267 --> 03:52.233
So what?

03:52.267 --> 03:55.134
Today's Wednesday!

03:58.334 --> 04:02.233
Anyway, the next thing I knew,
I was insane.

04:02.267 --> 04:06.133
Take a good look
at your future, rat boy.

04:06.167 --> 04:09.033
So, honey, tell us
what the doctor said.

04:09.067 --> 04:11.633
Well, he found
two interesting things.

04:11.667 --> 04:13.500
Well, that's two more
than I've ever found.

04:13.534 --> 04:15.401
I wonder where
was he looking.

04:18.233 --> 04:19.666
I'm just kidding, honey.

04:19.701 --> 04:21.166
We really do care.

04:21.200 --> 04:23.633
So, what did
the doctor say?

04:23.667 --> 04:26.500
Well, he said
from your home cooking,

04:26.534 --> 04:29.467
my stomach
is the size of a quarter,

04:29.501 --> 04:32.266
and that I suffer
from stress.

04:32.300 --> 04:34.233
Stress?

04:34.267 --> 04:36.333
How could you
get stress?

04:36.367 --> 04:38.300
You don't do anything
but get up and go to work.

04:38.334 --> 04:43.900
Well, maybe he got it
from a toilet seat.

04:44.667 --> 04:47.800
It would've shown up
long before this, honey.

04:48.300 --> 04:50.733
Stress?
Al, that is ridiculous.

04:50.767 --> 04:53.934
I mean, how in the world would
someone like you get stress?

04:54.901 --> 04:59.234
Well, the doctor thinks
it might be the wife.

05:01.100 --> 05:02.567
Well, very nice.

05:02.601 --> 05:04.500
So now it's my fault

05:04.534 --> 05:06.066
that you have
a go-nowhere job

05:06.100 --> 05:08.333
and absolutely
no ambition at all.

05:08.367 --> 05:11.500
Why, you know, if it wasn't for
me telling you day after day

05:11.534 --> 05:14.600
to get up, get to work,
and do something for God's sake,

05:14.634 --> 05:16.600
you wouldn't be bringing home
the chump change

05:16.634 --> 05:17.700
that you already are.

05:17.734 --> 05:20.600
Stress.

05:20.634 --> 05:23.099
Mom, don't you think that we
should be nice to Daddy,

05:23.133 --> 05:25.433
you know, with him
being out of his, uh...

05:25.467 --> 05:29.101
M- I-N-E-D?

05:29.901 --> 05:32.099
Yes, honey,
you're right.

05:32.133 --> 05:34.300
It is the woman's
lot in life

05:34.334 --> 05:36.266
to always carry the man.

05:36.300 --> 05:39.066
Always the helper,
never the helped.

05:39.100 --> 05:41.500
So, what'd the doctor
say you should do,

05:41.534 --> 05:44.166
you big sissy?

05:44.200 --> 05:47.900
Well, he said I should maybe
find myself a relaxing hobby.

05:47.934 --> 05:51.767
You know, uh, start
a vegetable garden.

05:52.767 --> 05:54.099
A vegetable garden?

05:54.133 --> 05:57.468
Well, you started one of those
when you had Kelly.

06:06.968 --> 06:08.900
Hey.

06:08.934 --> 06:12.900
I thought we were supposed to be
making fun of Dad here.

06:12.934 --> 06:14.133
You're right, honey.

06:14.167 --> 06:16.434
A vegetable garden.

06:17.834 --> 06:20.667
Oh, can you see your father
in a vegetable garden?

06:20.701 --> 06:23.733
Hey, I can see myself
in a vegetable garden.

06:23.767 --> 06:26.633
Out in the open air,
working with the land.

06:26.667 --> 06:28.767
You know, growin' stuff
and eatin' it.

06:28.801 --> 06:30.900
Yep, that's what
I'm gonna do.

06:30.934 --> 06:33.133
I'm gonna grow myself
the bestest vegetable garden

06:33.167 --> 06:34.300
in the world.

06:34.334 --> 06:36.700
I'm gonna grow me beans
and tomaters.

06:36.734 --> 06:38.633
Potaters.

06:38.667 --> 06:41.800
Ham...corn...uh...

06:41.834 --> 06:45.401
I'm gonna fish...fish them
little shrimps that I like.

06:45.767 --> 06:48.200
And...bread.
Homegrown bread.

06:48.234 --> 06:49.200
And butter.

06:49.234 --> 06:52.401
And pizza
with extra cheese.

06:53.133 --> 06:56.166
Kids, does anyone else
sense doom around here?

06:56.200 --> 06:58.999
* Dum dee-dee, dum dee-dee
Dum dee-dee *

06:59.033 --> 07:01.934
* Vegetable garden! *

07:03.434 --> 07:05.333
I think
we all sense it, Mom.

07:05.367 --> 07:07.433
* Dum dee-dee, dum dee-dee
Dum dee-dee *

07:07.467 --> 07:09.700
* Dum-dum, corn *

07:22.100 --> 07:26.434
Kids, soon all this
will be yourn.

07:29.767 --> 07:32.401
Well, golly.

07:33.901 --> 07:37.133
Hey, where'd you learn to farm
and speak like a hick, Daddy?

07:37.167 --> 07:40.900
Well, kids, all you really need
for farmin' is the right tools,

07:40.934 --> 07:42.900
a farmin'
state of mind,

07:42.934 --> 07:47.067
<i>and your very own copy
of Farmer Iggy's Almanac.</i>

07:47.868 --> 07:50.800
Let's see what the Igster
has to say this morning.

07:50.834 --> 07:55.034
"Plant in the mornin',
vegetables a-bornin'."

07:59.734 --> 08:01.266
Thanks a lot, Mom.

08:01.300 --> 08:03.967
Keen choice o' dads.

08:04.834 --> 08:06.033
Look, Peg.

08:06.067 --> 08:09.633
The corn is as high
as an elephant's eye.

08:09.667 --> 08:12.733
Oh, honey, I couldn't
be prouder of you

08:12.767 --> 08:14.934
if you thought
you were Napoleon.

08:14.968 --> 08:18.033
Come, look at my beans, Peg.

08:18.067 --> 08:21.967
Been a long time since you seen
a bean that size, eh, babe?

08:23.167 --> 08:25.500
Yeah, you sure know
how to grow 'em, honey.

08:26.100 --> 08:28.999
Soon we will have
a bountiful harvest,

08:29.033 --> 08:32.232
and you'll be cookin',
a- cannin' and a-servin'.

08:32.267 --> 08:35.433
And I'll be eatin',
a- belchin' and a-purgin'.

08:36.534 --> 08:38.567
Yep, it's been a long time

08:38.601 --> 08:42.633
since we've been
this happy, eh, babe?

08:42.667 --> 08:45.800
Want a cheek
of Redman?

08:47.300 --> 08:49.467
You're still not well,
are you?

08:49.501 --> 08:52.200
Not by a long shot.

08:52.234 --> 08:53.700
But I'm happy.

08:53.734 --> 08:56.300
Now get thee
in the house, woman.

08:56.334 --> 08:57.867
As farmer Iggy says,

08:57.901 --> 09:01.967
"Wife standin' near,
soon comes a tear."

09:07.934 --> 09:10.099
Well, I thought
she'd never leave.

09:10.133 --> 09:13.333
Now it's just you and me,
hey, guys?

09:13.367 --> 09:16.133
* Old McBundy had a farm *

09:16.167 --> 09:17.867
* B-U-N-D-Y *

09:17.901 --> 09:20.366
* And on this farm
There was no wife *

09:20.400 --> 09:21.867
* B-U-N-D-Y *

09:21.901 --> 09:23.834
* With a no wife here
And a no kids there *

09:23.868 --> 09:27.134
* A hooker comin' over
On Friday nights *

09:29.133 --> 09:32.567
* Big luscious hooters
And a pizza and a beer there *

09:32.601 --> 09:35.366
* Old McBundy had a farm *

09:35.400 --> 09:38.800
* B-U-N-D-Y *

09:46.734 --> 09:49.700
I never felt so relaxed.

09:58.267 --> 09:59.233
Hey.

09:59.267 --> 10:01.633
Rabbit, give me back
my carrots!

10:01.667 --> 10:03.667
Ow!

10:03.701 --> 10:05.166
Bite me, will you?

10:05.200 --> 10:06.767
Well, listen to this,
buddy.

10:06.801 --> 10:10.334
No one bites Al Bundy
and lives.

10:11.567 --> 10:15.967
Kiss your bonnie,
bunny butt goodbye, rabbit...

10:16.434 --> 10:19.001
'cause you're one dead--

10:21.834 --> 10:25.001
Peg, he peed on me!

10:33.567 --> 10:36.867
Hey, Kel, did you hear
about Billy's dad?

10:36.901 --> 10:40.800
He just made
vice president of his company.

10:40.834 --> 10:43.700
Hey, Bud, did you know
that Holly's dad,

10:43.734 --> 10:45.667
after many long years
of work,

10:45.701 --> 10:48.467
started his own company?

10:48.501 --> 10:51.834
Well, this must be the year
of the successful dad, ha.

10:51.868 --> 10:54.234
Let's see how yours
is doing.

10:56.667 --> 10:58.700
Let's see if you can swim
as well as you can steal,

10:58.734 --> 11:01.500
you bucktoothed
bandit.

11:02.634 --> 11:05.867
Is he not successful too,
who foams from the mouth

11:05.901 --> 11:08.500
and lies sputtering
on the ground?

11:08.534 --> 11:10.166
Gardening has calmed me down,

11:10.200 --> 11:13.201
and you just can't stand it,
can ya?

11:13.701 --> 11:15.033
Well, you'll be cheering me

11:15.067 --> 11:17.700
when this bunny
comes floating belly-up.

11:18.567 --> 11:20.767
Yeah, you'll be
a real hero, Dad.

11:20.801 --> 11:22.500
We can hear 'em
singing now:

11:22.534 --> 11:26.067
"Killed him a bunny
when he was 43."

11:26.767 --> 11:29.266
No rabbit's foot for you,
young lady.

11:29.300 --> 11:31.633
Dad, you've had the hose on
for four hours now,

11:31.667 --> 11:33.166
and the ground
isn't even wet.

11:33.200 --> 11:34.633
Where's all that
water going?

11:34.667 --> 11:36.500
How the hell should I know
where it's going?

11:36.534 --> 11:38.200
I don't even know where
it's coming from

11:38.234 --> 11:40.368
when it comes out
of the hose.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.433
I just-- I just wish
I could go with it.

11:43.467 --> 11:46.934
Shh! I hear
some squishing sounds.

11:54.934 --> 11:56.533
Oh!

11:56.567 --> 11:58.800
What did you do?

11:58.834 --> 12:02.166
Gee, Marcie,
what happened to you?

12:02.200 --> 12:03.567
What happened to me?

12:03.601 --> 12:05.400
I finally got a date.

12:05.434 --> 12:08.700
A successful man.
A handsome man.

12:08.734 --> 12:11.767
Sure, he was married,
but he was gonna leave her.

12:11.801 --> 12:13.333
He told me so.

12:13.367 --> 12:15.633
He told me his wife
didn't understand him.

12:15.667 --> 12:17.233
Like, what's so hard to
understand

12:17.267 --> 12:18.333
about
a 40-year-old man

12:18.367 --> 12:21.967
who likes to be
spanked for his sins?

12:22.667 --> 12:24.934
Anyway, we get back
to my house,

12:24.968 --> 12:28.700
I open the door, and step into
my living-room pond.

12:29.501 --> 12:32.366
It seems that some idiot
stuck a hose in the ground

12:32.400 --> 12:34.467
and left the water on
all day.

12:34.501 --> 12:35.667
So I was wondering,

12:35.701 --> 12:38.267
have you seen an idiot
with a hose anywhere?

12:38.934 --> 12:40.667
Hey, Marcie, you've given me
a good idea.

12:40.701 --> 12:42.400
Bring your head
over here by the hole.

12:42.434 --> 12:45.167
He'll think it's a cabbage,
and then we'll have him.

12:51.167 --> 12:54.667
Look, Al, we all appreciate
the fact that you're insane

12:54.701 --> 12:56.900
and that you need
a relaxing hobby,

12:56.934 --> 12:59.800
but maybe this gardening thing
is just a little too challenging

12:59.834 --> 13:01.500
at this point in your life.

13:01.534 --> 13:05.700
Have you tried Silly Putty
on the comics page?

13:05.734 --> 13:09.300
He has. He just couldn't get
the egg open.

13:09.334 --> 13:11.500
Oh. Well.

13:11.534 --> 13:13.934
I will be sending you
a bill for the damage.

13:13.968 --> 13:15.300
And if you do not pay,

13:15.334 --> 13:18.099
I will sue you
for everything you've got,

13:18.133 --> 13:23.001
and that includes
my garbage cans.

13:25.200 --> 13:28.167
Great. That leaves us
with nothing in the will.

13:30.267 --> 13:32.333
Well, I guess
we're just gonna have to make it

13:32.367 --> 13:34.533
on our good looks.

13:34.567 --> 13:37.201
See you on skid row,
bacon face.

13:40.167 --> 13:42.533
We're all
getting cranky, Al.

13:42.567 --> 13:44.433
Did you get
that rabbit yet?

13:44.467 --> 13:45.834
Are you kiddin' me?

13:45.868 --> 13:48.567
I must have poured a million
gallons of water down that hole.

13:48.601 --> 13:50.999
I flooded the whole block
and every living thing in it.

13:51.033 --> 13:53.099
Now, if that rabbit's
still alive,

13:53.133 --> 13:56.034
I'm yours tonight.

14:04.033 --> 14:06.166
You know,
the sad part is, I--

14:06.200 --> 14:08.934
I don't
really want him. Hm.

14:10.067 --> 14:13.167
But a promise
is a promise.

14:13.901 --> 14:16.133
Now look
what you've done!

14:16.167 --> 14:18.633
You'll be screaming
worse than me, I'm telling you!

14:18.667 --> 14:20.567
I'll get you for this!

14:20.601 --> 14:23.434
I'll make you pay for this,
I'm telling you...!

14:39.400 --> 14:42.200
Okay, I'm all through
with the poison now.

14:42.234 --> 14:43.700
You can take off
your masks.

14:43.734 --> 14:47.267
Um, not you, Peg.
Uh, yours wasn't working anyway.

14:49.868 --> 14:53.967
Bud, Dad said that you could
take your mask off.

14:56.467 --> 14:57.700
Eat Dad's okra.

14:57.734 --> 14:59.667
Lick his onions.

14:59.701 --> 15:01.533
Kids!

15:01.567 --> 15:06.001
Kids, let's not forget
that Daddy is the enemy here.

15:09.133 --> 15:11.233
There, now,
that's better.

15:11.267 --> 15:13.200
Honey,
do you think it's wise

15:13.234 --> 15:16.333
to indiscriminately spray
poison on a windy day?

15:16.367 --> 15:18.200
Peg, if you wanna make
a rabbit omelet,

15:18.234 --> 15:20.467
sometimes you gotta
break some eggs.

15:20.501 --> 15:21.700
But don't worry about it.

15:21.734 --> 15:23.500
I read the directions
very carefully.

15:23.534 --> 15:26.834
It's nontoxic to everything
but rabbits.

15:34.567 --> 15:35.733
Hi there.

15:35.767 --> 15:37.900
Anyone been spraying poison?

15:42.667 --> 15:44.166
Why do you ask?

15:44.200 --> 15:46.500
Well, there I was,
out in our backyard,

15:46.534 --> 15:49.800
you know, drying my TV
from the flooding,

15:49.834 --> 15:53.166
when a bald eagle came to drink
from my bird feeder.

15:53.200 --> 15:56.800
Wow. We haven't had a bald eagle
spotted in this area for years.

15:56.834 --> 15:59.133
I know. They're very rare
and beautiful,

15:59.167 --> 16:01.800
except when they're twitching
and hacking their guts out

16:01.834 --> 16:03.900
on my lawn.

16:03.934 --> 16:05.300
You really should have seen it.

16:05.334 --> 16:07.333
It was quite
an excruciating death.

16:07.367 --> 16:08.667
Way to go, Al.

16:08.701 --> 16:10.834
Why don't you throw
one of your socks out the window

16:10.868 --> 16:14.099
and try for the last dodo?

16:14.133 --> 16:17.800
Well, I like to think
that I'm the last dodo, Peg.

16:17.834 --> 16:20.200
But more importantly,
I'm gonna have some vegetables,

16:20.234 --> 16:21.667
'cause there's no way
in the world

16:21.701 --> 16:23.966
that rabbit could have
have survived that death cloud

16:24.000 --> 16:26.234
I let loose
on the neighborhood.

16:29.834 --> 16:31.434
It lives.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.633
Okay, fine.

16:34.667 --> 16:36.200
I didn't ask
for a hobby.

16:36.234 --> 16:37.966
I hate vegetables.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.101
But I need that garden
to relieve my stress, damn it!

16:42.400 --> 16:44.133
And I will have that garden

16:44.167 --> 16:47.033
if I have to kill
every single living thing

16:47.067 --> 16:49.467
in this entire,
stinking planet.

16:49.501 --> 16:51.900
This is war.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.900
Al, what are you doing?

17:12.300 --> 17:15.733
Be vewy, vewy quiet.

17:16.901 --> 17:20.001
I'm huntin' wabbit.

17:23.032 --> 17:25.300
Oh, boy.

17:25.867 --> 17:28.165
Daddy, let me give you
some advice.

17:28.200 --> 17:32.700
Um, I've been watching these
television show about rabbits.

17:34.200 --> 17:36.934
Don't put the barrel of the gun
down the hole,

17:36.968 --> 17:38.700
because what they do

17:38.734 --> 17:40.133
is they'll tie it in a knot

17:40.167 --> 17:43.434
so that it explodes
in your face.

17:46.033 --> 17:47.533
Or sometimes
what they'll do

17:47.567 --> 17:49.600
is they'll make it
really long and curved

17:49.634 --> 17:52.500
so that it comes out
from a hole behind you,

17:52.534 --> 17:55.934
and you shoot yourself
in the butt.

17:58.567 --> 18:03.034
To be forewarned
is to have four arms.

18:09.601 --> 18:14.067
Well, Princeton's loss
is The Gap's gain.

18:14.467 --> 18:17.967
Oh, Mr. Wabbit!

18:18.834 --> 18:22.334
Come and get
a tasty cawwot!

18:25.067 --> 18:27.934
Well, at least he didn't
shoot himself in the foot.

18:27.968 --> 18:30.067
Hmph.
Give him a minute.

18:30.567 --> 18:33.533
Ah! Ow, my foot!

18:37.734 --> 18:40.300
What's he doing now?

18:40.334 --> 18:43.600
Well, he's got
the flamethrower.

18:44.334 --> 18:46.233
He's aiming it
at the hole.

18:46.267 --> 18:48.001
He shoots...

18:50.400 --> 18:52.099
and misses.

18:52.133 --> 18:54.166
Garden on fire?

18:54.200 --> 18:56.133
Yup.

18:56.167 --> 18:59.201
And so is
Mrs. Rhoades' fence.

18:59.934 --> 19:03.001
Whoa!
Look at her big tree go.

19:04.901 --> 19:07.200
Well, at least he didn't
shoot himself in the foot.

19:07.234 --> 19:09.700
Hmph.
Give him a minute.

19:11.767 --> 19:15.067
Ow, my foot! Ow, my-- Ow!

19:15.834 --> 19:17.633
Oh, fire!
Ow, my foot!

19:17.667 --> 19:20.600
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh!

19:35.067 --> 19:37.900
So this is how it ends,
eh, Mom?

19:38.100 --> 19:40.266
As long as it ends.

19:40.300 --> 19:42.101
Daddy?

19:42.667 --> 19:44.368
What?

19:45.934 --> 19:47.433
Nothing.

19:47.467 --> 19:49.433
Good.

19:49.467 --> 19:52.999
Now, I put this down
his little hole,

19:53.033 --> 19:54.400
and I light the fuse,

19:54.434 --> 19:56.767
and bye-bye rabbit.

20:08.467 --> 20:09.767
The fuse is lit,

20:09.801 --> 20:13.733
and we'll be hit by bunny bits
any second now.

20:13.767 --> 20:17.567
Now do you see the importance
of an education, kids?

20:17.901 --> 20:18.934
Uh, Dad...

20:18.968 --> 20:21.333
before your fingers
hit pay dirt,

20:21.367 --> 20:23.934
are you sure you didn't use
too much dynamite?

20:23.968 --> 20:25.834
Son, if dynamite was dangerous,

20:25.868 --> 20:29.067
do you think they'd sell it
to an idiot like me?

20:29.634 --> 20:31.266
Now, nothing can go wrong.

20:31.300 --> 20:33.099
I've taken every precaution.

20:33.133 --> 20:36.368
Including making sure
it was nowhere near a gas line?

20:44.467 --> 20:46.067
Hit the dirt.

21:01.801 --> 21:05.700
You know, it's such
a beautiful day.

21:05.734 --> 21:09.033
I hardly miss
the house at all.

21:09.067 --> 21:12.733
It was a nice explosion,
wasn't it?

21:12.767 --> 21:13.900
But on the good side,

21:13.934 --> 21:17.600
the ensuing fire
did dry out my living room.

21:17.634 --> 21:19.366
But the sun
would have done that anyway,

21:19.400 --> 21:22.167
since I no longer
have a roof.

21:22.901 --> 21:26.434
Well, that's odd.
We have two.

21:26.968 --> 21:29.667
Yeah, one for each wall
in my room.

21:29.701 --> 21:33.400
Nobody's asked me
how my stress is.

21:33.434 --> 21:35.934
Oh, we're sorry.

21:35.968 --> 21:39.167
How's your stress,
lint-for-brains?

21:39.667 --> 21:40.733
I'm mellow.

21:40.767 --> 21:42.033
You know why?

21:42.067 --> 21:45.099
You don't see a rabbit out here,
do you?

21:45.133 --> 21:46.567
Sure don't, honey.

21:46.601 --> 21:48.133
You did real good.

21:48.167 --> 21:50.934
That's all I wanted to hear.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.600
You know,
I really feel good.

22:10.634 --> 22:12.533
Carrot?

22:15.300 --> 22:18.201
That's Al, folks.
