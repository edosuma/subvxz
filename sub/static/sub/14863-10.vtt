00:01.898 --> 00:05.225
I'm sorry, Daniel. I
won't be calling you again.

00:05.244 --> 00:07.036
Previously on "Mistresses"...

00:07.037 --> 00:09.303
It's Paul. Please don't hang up.

00:09.337 --> 00:10.303
I'm in trouble.

00:10.337 --> 00:11.604
And it's serious.

00:11.637 --> 00:13.270
I got mixed up with some bad people.

00:13.303 --> 00:15.138
Paul, who is after you?

00:15.171 --> 00:17.238
You like when people need you.

00:17.270 --> 00:19.504
Dom doesn't need you. He just loves you.

00:19.537 --> 00:21.138
Savi doesn't deserve you.

00:21.171 --> 00:22.238
She never did.

00:31.270 --> 00:32.837
I needed more time.

00:32.871 --> 00:35.171
But he said, "it's our
wedding night. We have to."

00:35.204 --> 00:36.704
He raped you.

00:36.737 --> 00:41.303
I didn't want to feel like this anymore.

00:41.337 --> 00:43.804
You're okay.

00:43.837 --> 00:45.837
You're okay.

01:03.437 --> 01:04.937
Good morning.

01:04.971 --> 01:06.037
Morning.

01:06.071 --> 01:09.037
Did you sleep all right?

01:09.071 --> 01:12.570
Uh, like a rock, actually.

01:14.204 --> 01:15.971
Thanks for letting me crash here.

01:16.004 --> 01:18.238
You had a pretty grueling night.

01:18.270 --> 01:20.537
If you want to talk some more...

01:20.570 --> 01:23.303
I think I'm all talked out for now.

01:23.337 --> 01:25.204
That's okay, too.

01:25.238 --> 01:28.771
Uh, but I could really use a cup of coffee.

01:28.804 --> 01:30.504
Would that be weird?

01:30.537 --> 01:33.470
I think it's safe to say that
we've passed that boundary.

01:33.504 --> 01:35.238
Uh, milk and sugar?

01:35.270 --> 01:37.370
Yes, please.

01:42.771 --> 01:45.403
You can answer it if you want.

01:45.437 --> 01:48.337
I can call back.

01:50.737 --> 01:52.971
So, what does your day look like?

01:53.004 --> 01:54.704
I have work in an hour.

01:54.737 --> 01:55.704
Work?

01:57.171 --> 01:59.537
I'm a waitress at Sammy's. It's downtown.

01:59.570 --> 02:02.403
Oh. I don't think I've ever been.

02:02.437 --> 02:04.771
I don't blame you. It's
just a crappy diner.

02:04.804 --> 02:06.837
Do you feel up to working today?

02:06.871 --> 02:09.402
I need the money.

02:09.437 --> 02:11.537
Um, they've already cut
our hours like crazy.

02:11.570 --> 02:15.370
At this point, I'm gonna
have to head straight there.

02:15.403 --> 02:20.004
Could I use your bathroom
to wash up real quick?

02:21.238 --> 02:23.104
Of course.

02:23.138 --> 02:25.771
Let me just... let me
just move some things.

02:25.804 --> 02:28.104
And I'll get you a towel.

02:49.670 --> 02:52.270
Hey, boss. Wanted to see me?

02:52.303 --> 02:53.937
Yeah. Uh, close the door.

02:56.204 --> 02:57.470
So, um...

03:00.238 --> 03:01.437
the other night...

03:01.470 --> 03:02.804
Was the other night.

03:02.837 --> 03:04.737
I drank too much. You drank too much.

03:04.771 --> 03:06.837
Whatever happened, happened.

03:06.871 --> 03:08.470
Let's just call it what it is, right?

03:08.504 --> 03:10.837
Right.

03:10.871 --> 03:12.537
Look, I'm not looking for anything, Dom.

03:12.570 --> 03:14.604
You don't have to worry
about me getting attached.

03:14.637 --> 03:16.470
No, I-I didn't mean it like that.

03:16.504 --> 03:18.303
Well, I'm telling you anyways.

03:18.337 --> 03:19.670
And I appreciate it.

03:19.704 --> 03:22.004
I just, um...

03:22.037 --> 03:24.437
I don't even believe I have to say this.

03:24.470 --> 03:28.104
Uh, I need this all to stay between us.

03:28.138 --> 03:29.971
Naturally.

03:30.004 --> 03:32.104
It wouldn't look good for me, either.

03:32.138 --> 03:33.771
Yeah, but you're leaving, though.

03:33.804 --> 03:35.971
And gossip is the last
thing I need following me.

03:36.004 --> 03:37.171
Of course.

03:37.204 --> 03:39.289
So, um... oh, speaking of which,

03:39.290 --> 03:41.008
when, uh, when are you
planning on telling Mitchell

03:41.009 --> 03:42.337
and the other partners about that?

03:42.370 --> 03:43.470
Today, actually.

03:45.270 --> 03:48.303
Oh. Uh...

03:48.337 --> 03:49.370
Okay, then.

03:49.403 --> 03:50.403
Uh...

03:52.804 --> 03:55.071
Anything else?

03:55.104 --> 03:58.204
No. No, that was, uh... that was it.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.470
Bueno.

04:03.570 --> 04:07.004
Can I talk to you for a second?

04:07.037 --> 04:09.104
Someplace else?

04:09.138 --> 04:10.704
Um... Sure.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.470
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

04:19.504 --> 04:21.137
Ta-da!

04:21.171 --> 04:23.665
Yeah, that is... that's really good.

04:23.666 --> 04:24.637
- Yeah?
- Yep.

04:24.670 --> 04:26.853
Uh, the goat-cheese tarts
are still a "maybe," though.

04:26.854 --> 04:29.701
Oh, that's fine. I can just move
up the grass-fed-beef carpaccio.

04:29.702 --> 04:31.325
- No problem.
- Not till I tell you you can.

04:31.326 --> 04:32.971
Oh. Mm-hmm-hmm-hmm.

04:33.004 --> 04:35.303
Oh.

04:35.337 --> 04:36.504
Oh, it's Scott.

04:36.537 --> 04:38.204
Oh, my package.

04:38.238 --> 04:39.604
He sent you a selfie?

04:39.637 --> 04:42.765
Ew! No! This package I've been
waiting for finally arrived.

04:42.766 --> 04:43.732
Look. See?

04:43.766 --> 04:45.933
His grandma's turning 97 tomorrow.

04:45.966 --> 04:48.166
Yeah, so, they're having a big
thing at his parents' house.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.149
I had to get her something.

04:49.150 --> 04:51.353
You already gave her your
dog. What more does she need?

04:51.354 --> 04:53.533
I was so nervous it
wouldn't get here in time.

04:53.567 --> 04:55.567
Hmm.

04:55.599 --> 04:57.999
Okay.

04:58.033 --> 04:59.567
That's the, uh...

04:59.599 --> 05:01.599
That's the only thing
you were nervous about?

05:01.632 --> 05:03.100
What do you mean?

05:03.133 --> 05:05.533
Well, aren't you meeting
Scott's whole family

05:05.567 --> 05:06.393
for the first time?

05:06.394 --> 05:08.366
His mother and all?

05:08.400 --> 05:10.266
That's kind of a big deal, right?

05:10.300 --> 05:11.467
Well, I guess.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.540
But in case you hadn't
noticed, I'm kind of likable.

05:14.567 --> 05:15.699
Yeah, my mom hated you.

05:15.732 --> 05:16.465
What?!

05:16.466 --> 05:17.985
Well, to be fair, she loved Savi,

05:17.986 --> 05:20.266
so her judgment might have been a bit off.

05:20.300 --> 05:21.835
Well, I-I thought she loved me.

05:21.836 --> 05:23.300
Well, she does now.

05:23.333 --> 05:25.732
The point is, most mothers
aren't like yours, Joss...

05:25.766 --> 05:28.066
you know, none of this
hippie, free-love stuff.

05:28.100 --> 05:29.732
They've got their own protocol,

05:29.766 --> 05:31.433
and let's face it... protocol...

05:31.467 --> 05:33.300
...not your forte.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.599
Okay, that's rude!

05:34.632 --> 05:37.066
Oh, you know I'm saying this
with love, but you're, uh...

05:37.100 --> 05:39.467
You're a bit of a tornado, you know?

05:39.500 --> 05:42.100
And then all the sex
jokes... it's like a tic.

05:42.133 --> 05:44.166
Wow! Well, someone's been
holding some things in.

05:44.200 --> 05:46.053
I'm so sorry. I didn't
realize I was such a liability.

05:46.054 --> 05:46.819
No, you'll be all right.

05:46.820 --> 05:49.186
Just... just don't talk
so fast or swear so much

05:49.187 --> 05:51.128
or tell your lesbian stories.

05:51.129 --> 05:52.307
Okay, I got to go.

05:52.308 --> 05:54.790
No, come on. Don't get mad.
I'm just trying to help.

05:54.791 --> 05:55.856
Well, you're freaking me out!

05:55.857 --> 05:57.162
Now I have to get a different outfit

05:57.163 --> 05:59.766
and a different gift and
a different everything!

06:00.833 --> 06:02.433
Probably shouldn't drink, either.

06:02.467 --> 06:05.599
Seriously?! Wha...

06:11.333 --> 06:14.200
So, uh, about last night...

06:16.100 --> 06:18.022
Did you get my message?

06:18.023 --> 06:19.999
Message?

06:20.033 --> 06:21.567
Yeah.

06:21.599 --> 06:25.533
I, uh, called you because I
wanted to tell you that I...

06:25.567 --> 06:27.166
I went to see my dad.

06:28.632 --> 06:29.866
Your dad?

06:29.899 --> 06:31.100
Um... How?

06:31.133 --> 06:34.567
I drove to Paso Robles.

06:34.599 --> 06:35.699
Well, you asked me

06:35.732 --> 06:37.866
to think about what I was doing with Zack,

06:37.899 --> 06:42.632
so I've been asking myself
some tough questions...

06:42.666 --> 06:47.433
about me and... and men, mostly.

06:47.467 --> 06:50.266
And I thought I'd pay a visit
to the first man in my life

06:50.300 --> 06:52.467
and see if I could get any answers.

06:53.866 --> 06:55.133
So, how'd that go?

06:56.866 --> 07:01.632
It was like... sitting with a neighbor...

07:01.666 --> 07:04.166
an acquaintance, not a dad.

07:07.933 --> 07:10.785
He left me when he left my
mom, and he never looked back.

07:10.786 --> 07:11.507
Savi...

07:11.508 --> 07:13.200
No, I was disposable.

07:13.233 --> 07:14.400
No, you're not.

07:14.433 --> 07:16.400
I am to him.

07:18.233 --> 07:20.440
So since then, I've promised myself

07:20.441 --> 07:24.100
that I would never feel like that again.

07:24.133 --> 07:24.912
Right?

07:24.913 --> 07:28.366
So I-I chose men that needed me.

07:28.400 --> 07:32.833
You know, I was... I was the together one,

07:32.866 --> 07:36.966
the stable one, the one with the drive

07:36.999 --> 07:40.567
or... or the one with the money.

07:40.599 --> 07:45.533
But when... I started seeing you...

07:45.567 --> 07:47.999
I mean, you had the house

07:48.033 --> 07:51.632
and the job and the... and the plan.

07:51.666 --> 07:53.799
You were together.

07:53.833 --> 07:56.467
You were fine.

07:58.233 --> 07:59.966
Well, what does Zack have to do with this?

07:59.999 --> 08:05.533
Well, Zack came to my
door a sad, broken puppy,

08:05.567 --> 08:09.599
and I thought I could fix him, help him,

08:09.632 --> 08:11.533
and that made me feel good.

08:11.567 --> 08:15.899
So, are you saying you need me to need you?

08:15.933 --> 08:18.999
- Because...
- No. No.

08:19.033 --> 08:21.933
I'm saying that I need to learn

08:21.966 --> 08:27.699
how to be with someone
that just... wants me.

08:30.133 --> 08:32.899
And I-I really want
that someone to be you.

08:38.467 --> 08:39.666
Okay.

08:41.433 --> 08:42.666
Okay?

08:42.698 --> 08:44.366
Okay.

08:49.999 --> 08:51.833
Brynn, hi. I know I'm running late.

08:51.866 --> 08:53.799
Do you think you can open without me?

08:53.833 --> 08:56.100
I am leaving the house
this second, I swear.

08:56.133 --> 08:57.599
Bye.

09:00.133 --> 09:01.799
April Malloy?

09:01.833 --> 09:04.033
I don't know who you are, but I
am calling the police right now.

09:04.066 --> 09:05.533
Agent Adam Thomas, FBI.

09:05.567 --> 09:09.133
I'm here to talk to you
about your husband, Paul.

09:22.171 --> 09:25.171
Have you ever heard of a
man named Domingo Olivos?

09:25.204 --> 09:25.905
Who?

09:25.906 --> 09:27.440
Cuban. Came up in Miami.

09:27.474 --> 09:29.750
Currently runs one of the biggest

09:29.751 --> 09:32.484
drug-distribution operations
on the east coast...

09:32.518 --> 09:36.251
cocaine, marijuana, heroin most recently.

09:36.284 --> 09:38.317
Your husband's been working for him.

09:38.351 --> 09:39.918
What?

09:39.951 --> 09:42.017
For over a year.

09:42.050 --> 09:44.484
I don't know what you're talking about.

09:44.518 --> 09:46.417
Well, we've been tapping his phone.

09:46.451 --> 09:47.951
We heard his calls to you.

09:51.384 --> 09:53.815
This can't be. This isn't him.

09:53.816 --> 09:56.384
I mean, Paul has affairs
and gets women pregnant.

09:56.417 --> 09:58.651
He's an idiot. He's not a gangster.

09:58.684 --> 10:01.351
He doesn't go work for
some Cuban drug lord.

10:01.384 --> 10:03.017
He faked his own death

10:03.050 --> 10:05.484
and showed up here last
year resurrected, am I right?

10:06.985 --> 10:08.985
Well, then, let's assume
you don't know everything

10:09.017 --> 10:10.257
that your husband's capable of.

10:11.684 --> 10:14.217
We think that's how he got involved

10:14.251 --> 10:17.150
with Olivos' organization
in the first place.

10:17.184 --> 10:18.451
How?

10:18.484 --> 10:21.017
Well, after he blew up the
boat that he was supposedly on,

10:21.050 --> 10:22.751
he needed a completely new identity,

10:22.784 --> 10:24.551
including a new social security number.

10:24.584 --> 10:27.751
Those aren't easy to come by,
except on the black market.

10:27.784 --> 10:30.784
And where there's a black
market, there's Olivos.

10:30.818 --> 10:32.818
We believe that Olivos' people

10:32.851 --> 10:35.751
helped establish a new
identity for your husband

10:35.784 --> 10:37.684
in exchange for his services.

10:37.718 --> 10:39.851
As a drug dealer?

10:39.885 --> 10:42.323
No... computer guy.

10:42.324 --> 10:46.251
Hacking into bank accounts,
establishing online companies

10:46.284 --> 10:47.918
for their money-laundering operation...

10:47.951 --> 10:50.951
under the name Paul Benson, as it were.

10:50.985 --> 10:52.150
I see.

10:55.317 --> 10:58.217
It's not really your husband
we're after here, Mrs. Malloy.

10:58.251 --> 11:01.188
We've been building a
case against Domingo Olivos

11:01.189 --> 11:02.370
for almost four years.

11:02.371 --> 11:03.798
Oh.

11:03.799 --> 11:06.094
But Paul's position in the organization

11:06.095 --> 11:07.618
has given him quite a bit of knowledge

11:07.651 --> 11:10.851
and access to Olivos' money.

11:10.885 --> 11:12.050
Like you said,

11:12.084 --> 11:14.251
Paul's not really the
hardened-criminal type, right?

11:14.284 --> 11:17.152
We thought he might be
receptive to a way out,

11:17.153 --> 11:18.851
so three months ago, we approached him

11:18.885 --> 11:21.417
and offered him immunity
on the fraud charges

11:21.451 --> 11:23.851
in exchange for testifying against Olivos.

11:23.885 --> 11:25.217
Did he agree?

11:25.251 --> 11:26.651
He did.

11:26.684 --> 11:28.150
Then he backed out.

11:28.184 --> 11:31.751
He moved his other wife
and kid to Jacksonville.

11:31.784 --> 11:34.551
He disappeared, not a trace of him...

11:34.584 --> 11:37.050
that is, until the other
day, when he called you.

11:39.050 --> 11:41.584
So, Mrs. Malloy, as you
can see, we need your help.

11:51.951 --> 11:53.251
Need some help there?

11:54.484 --> 11:55.584
I got it.

11:55.618 --> 11:56.751
What is it?

11:56.784 --> 11:58.150
I'm returning it.

11:58.184 --> 12:00.084
Well, now I have to know.

12:00.117 --> 12:01.914
Stop... no, careful!

12:01.915 --> 12:03.104
That's 300 bucks you're holding,

12:03.105 --> 12:04.749
and they don't take back broken items.

12:05.539 --> 12:07.689
300 bucks for this?

12:07.690 --> 12:08.885
Why?

12:08.918 --> 12:11.718
Be... it's a genuine
antique Verlys soap dish

12:11.751 --> 12:13.050
in the deco tradition.

12:13.084 --> 12:15.384
I-I thought Grandma June would like it,

12:15.417 --> 12:17.017
and then... I thought not.

12:17.050 --> 12:19.034
You don't have to spend that kind of money.

12:19.035 --> 12:20.337
Just put your name on my card.

12:20.338 --> 12:21.985
- Why? What did you get her?
- An iPad.

12:22.017 --> 12:24.733
An iPad?! She's like 110 years old.

12:24.734 --> 12:25.738
Very hip lady.

12:28.017 --> 12:31.387
Sweetheart, your presence
is her gift, okay?

12:31.388 --> 12:33.254
She and my mother are dying to meet you.

12:33.288 --> 12:34.765
They've been talking about it all week.

12:34.766 --> 12:37.671
Mm-kay. Want to put some more pressure on?

12:37.672 --> 12:39.672
They're all gonna love you.

12:39.705 --> 12:41.438
What's not to love?

12:41.472 --> 12:42.438
Exactly.

12:42.472 --> 12:44.139
And who cares?

12:44.173 --> 12:45.906
If they hate me, screw 'em.

12:48.739 --> 12:51.139
Not sure you have to go
that far with it, right?

12:51.173 --> 12:52.438
Why? What do you mean?

12:52.472 --> 12:55.505
Well, I mean, this is my
mother we're talking about here.

12:55.539 --> 12:57.305
You know, I-I definitely care.

12:59.106 --> 13:01.006
Oh. Wow. Okay.

13:01.039 --> 13:02.806
- So, you're that guy?
- What guy?

13:02.839 --> 13:04.505
If your mom doesn't like
me, you're not gonna like me?

13:04.539 --> 13:05.672
I think if my mom doesn't like you,

13:05.705 --> 13:07.505
it just makes things a
little more difficult for...

13:07.539 --> 13:08.705
Why are we arguing about this?

13:08.739 --> 13:10.214
You're gonna make an
effort tomorrow, right?

13:10.215 --> 13:11.966
You know what? At the moment, I
don't even want to go tomorrow.

13:11.967 --> 13:13.839
Honestly, I'd rather you not go,
either, if you're gonna act like this.

13:13.872 --> 13:15.772
Wh... are you un-inviting me?

13:15.806 --> 13:17.639
You just said...

13:17.672 --> 13:19.084
No! I'm going!

13:19.510 --> 13:20.505
For Grandma June.

13:20.539 --> 13:21.939
And I'm bringing my soap dish.

13:21.972 --> 13:24.006
It was good enough for Eleanor Roosevelt.

13:32.572 --> 13:34.505
Remind me to call Halpern in the morning

13:34.539 --> 13:36.505
to, uh, check on those phone records.

13:36.539 --> 13:37.205
Got it.

13:37.206 --> 13:39.672
Tomorrow, you have a
Griggs meeting at 9:30,

13:39.705 --> 13:42.206
staff meeting at 11:00, and
lunch with Michael Rosen.

13:42.239 --> 13:43.273
Great. Thanks.

13:43.305 --> 13:45.739
Oh, and, uh, Chloe? Go home.

13:45.772 --> 13:46.906
Got it.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.647
I really know how to pick them, don't I?

14:07.672 --> 14:09.206
Paul, Daniel.

14:09.239 --> 14:10.705
Why am I such an idiot?

14:10.739 --> 14:12.705
Honey, you're not an idiot.

14:12.739 --> 14:14.605
Seriously, who could've imagined this?

14:14.639 --> 14:16.739
You know, I'm not actually that surprised.

14:16.772 --> 14:19.927
I mean, dead Paul coming
back from the dead? Shocking.

14:19.928 --> 14:22.207
Back-from-the-dead Paul
working for a Cuban drug lord?

14:22.208 --> 14:23.332
Sure. Why not?

14:23.333 --> 14:24.195
I don't understand.

14:24.196 --> 14:26.997
So, if the FBI is looking for
this Olivos guy and not Paul,

14:27.030 --> 14:28.630
then what do you have to do with it?

14:28.663 --> 14:31.363
They need Paul to get to Olivos,
and they need me to get to Paul.

14:31.396 --> 14:33.162
How is Paul the key witness?

14:33.196 --> 14:34.863
Apparently, he knows where the money is.

14:34.896 --> 14:36.663
And he's the only one who answered the door

14:36.696 --> 14:37.896
when the FBI came knocking.

14:37.930 --> 14:39.696
Well, him and me, of course.

14:39.730 --> 14:42.997
But you don't know where he
is any more than the FBI does.

14:43.030 --> 14:44.196
Do you?

14:44.229 --> 14:45.363
Of course not!

14:45.396 --> 14:47.496
But the last time he called me, I told him

14:47.529 --> 14:50.129
I needed a way to contact
him in case of an emergency,

14:50.162 --> 14:52.262
and he told me he would send me something.

14:52.296 --> 14:53.392
Like, what kind of something?

14:53.393 --> 14:56.529
Phone number, an e-mail address.

14:56.563 --> 14:59.262
Whatever it is and whenever it comes,

14:59.296 --> 15:02.229
the FBI knows about it, and they want it.

15:02.262 --> 15:04.563
You know what? Screw the FBI.
You don't owe them anything.

15:04.596 --> 15:06.097
Right?!

15:06.129 --> 15:06.851
Yeah.

15:06.852 --> 15:09.563
Well, actually, uh... you kind of do.

15:09.596 --> 15:11.463
I mean, you knew that Paul was alive,

15:11.496 --> 15:13.296
so, technically, you committed fraud

15:13.329 --> 15:14.930
by keeping the insurance money,

15:14.963 --> 15:17.663
not to mention the
social security benefits.

15:17.696 --> 15:19.930
And now the FBI knows all of that.

15:19.963 --> 15:23.030
So they may be asking for your help today,

15:23.063 --> 15:25.496
but they might not ask tomorrow.

15:25.529 --> 15:29.630
You know, I mean, they
have stuff on you now.

15:30.763 --> 15:33.097
Sweetie, I'm so sorry,
and I hate to say this,

15:33.129 --> 15:35.730
but, honestly, I-I don't
think you have a choice.

16:03.377 --> 16:06.010
What's going on? Why
can't you just come I...

16:07.843 --> 16:09.810
I was thinking about
what you said last night

16:09.843 --> 16:11.043
about Paul and the FBI,

16:11.077 --> 16:13.143
and one thing's bothering me about it.

16:13.177 --> 16:15.130
Really? Only one thing?

16:15.131 --> 16:17.277
If Paul disappeared on the FBI,

16:17.310 --> 16:18.987
how are they tracking his phone calls?

16:18.988 --> 16:19.672
Technology?

16:19.673 --> 16:21.884
Yes, but if they had a
trace on Paul's phone,

16:21.885 --> 16:23.776
wouldn't they know where he was?

16:23.810 --> 16:25.457
If they really did lose him,

16:25.458 --> 16:27.876
how did they hear his calls to you?

16:27.910 --> 16:29.810
So you think...

16:29.843 --> 16:32.743
They must have heard
it from your end, April.

16:34.210 --> 16:36.123
You think they bugged my phone?

16:36.124 --> 16:38.491
Your phones, your house,
the shop... who knows?

16:38.525 --> 16:41.024
They could be watching you with cameras...

16:41.057 --> 16:42.425
maybe watching Lucy.

16:42.458 --> 16:43.425
Oh...

16:43.458 --> 16:44.794
oh, my God.

16:44.795 --> 16:46.124
Well, how would I know?

16:46.158 --> 16:47.991
I have a guy... a P.I. I used last year

16:48.024 --> 16:49.458
with the Elizabeth situation.

16:49.491 --> 16:51.324
There's an endorsement.

16:51.358 --> 16:53.158
He's smart, and he has the equipment.

16:53.191 --> 16:54.725
I'll call him today.

16:54.758 --> 16:58.057
In the meantime, just...
watch what you say.

17:13.223 --> 17:16.625
Uh, Chloe, what the hell is going on?

17:16.657 --> 17:18.057
Dom.

17:18.090 --> 17:20.791
We need to talk.

17:28.725 --> 17:31.892
Thanks for calling me back, George.

17:31.924 --> 17:34.957
Oh, you're out of town?

17:34.991 --> 17:38.491
Do you know anyone who
can help my friend April?

17:38.525 --> 17:41.124
It's obviously a very sensitive situation.

17:43.892 --> 17:46.558
George, can I call you back?

17:48.324 --> 17:49.391
Anna?

17:49.425 --> 17:51.057
I-I'm really sorry.

17:51.091 --> 17:53.453
I-I didn't want to call, but, um...

17:53.454 --> 17:55.924
I'm glad you did. What's going on?

17:55.957 --> 17:57.525
I don't really know, exactly.

17:57.558 --> 17:59.481
I-I'm supposed to be at work,

17:59.482 --> 18:01.525
but I don't think I can
leave my place right now.

18:01.558 --> 18:02.591
Okay.

18:02.625 --> 18:05.258
I-I can't breathe.

18:05.291 --> 18:07.858
My heart is beating so fast.

18:07.892 --> 18:10.591
Have you taken anything?
Any medication or...

18:10.625 --> 18:12.258
No, I didn't take anything.

18:12.291 --> 18:15.124
I'm coming to you right now, okay?

18:15.158 --> 18:17.391
Tell me your address.

18:26.024 --> 18:27.057
Ready?

18:27.091 --> 18:28.391
Ready, ready.

18:28.425 --> 18:29.391
All right.

18:31.425 --> 18:32.525
Joss! Welcome!

18:32.558 --> 18:34.924
Oh, my goodness! We're so glad you're here!

18:34.957 --> 18:37.491
It's so nice to finally meet you!

18:37.525 --> 18:39.124
Mwah! How are you?

18:42.924 --> 18:45.792
Hey. You've reached Josslyn
Carver at Events By Josslyn.

18:45.825 --> 18:48.258
Please leave a message
at the beep, and party on.

18:49.291 --> 18:51.091
Hey, Joss, uh, it's me.

18:51.124 --> 18:53.458
I, um...

18:53.491 --> 18:54.892
Uh, I just called to say...

18:54.924 --> 18:56.291
You know what?

18:56.324 --> 18:59.957
I-I just called to apologize
for being a jerk yesterday.

18:59.991 --> 19:02.658
I didn't mean... to get into your head.

19:02.691 --> 19:05.858
So please... just... be yourself, okay?

19:05.892 --> 19:07.892
And... and... and definitely have a drink.

19:07.924 --> 19:09.224
I'll have one, too.

19:09.258 --> 19:11.057
Not sure why I'm still talking now.

19:11.091 --> 19:12.725
Good stuff.

19:12.758 --> 19:14.358
Hey, have fun.

19:17.191 --> 19:19.736
Okay, you... you can't be serious.

19:19.737 --> 19:22.224
The firm takes allegations
of sexual harassment

19:22.258 --> 19:24.758
very seriously, so let me ask again...

19:24.792 --> 19:27.859
did you have a sexual
relationship with Antonia Ruiz?

19:30.525 --> 19:32.924
This will go a lot faster if
you just answer the questions.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.670
Yes, technically...

19:36.671 --> 19:38.858
and did you or did you not ask Ms. Ruiz

19:38.892 --> 19:40.691
to not tell anyone of said relationship?

19:40.725 --> 19:42.632
Yes.

19:42.633 --> 19:44.258
But this whole situation
is being misinterpreted.

19:44.291 --> 19:47.057
Listen, she asked me to get a drink,

19:47.091 --> 19:49.849
to celebrate her new job...
at Gallagher, Wilmore.

19:49.850 --> 19:51.825
Or did she not tell you about that?

19:51.858 --> 19:54.658
I'm not aware of any new job.

19:54.691 --> 19:56.391
Either way, Ms. Ruiz's future plans

19:56.425 --> 19:57.729
have nothing to do with the fact

19:57.730 --> 20:00.324
that she worked here when
the incident occurred.

20:00.358 --> 20:03.176
And this is not your first
relationship with a subordinate.

20:03.177 --> 20:05.566
- What do you mean?
- Savannah Davis.

20:05.567 --> 20:07.792
Oh, okay. No, no. Savi and
I are completely different.

20:07.825 --> 20:10.198
We did everything right.
We... we came to you.

20:10.199 --> 20:11.631
Not initially, you didn't.

20:11.632 --> 20:15.298
The fact remains, you were
Ms. Davis' superior, as well.

20:15.331 --> 20:18.398
There is at least the
appearance of a pattern,

20:18.432 --> 20:20.099
and the firm has to protect itself.

20:20.132 --> 20:23.217
And I think, as a partner,
you understand that.

20:23.519 --> 20:25.607
We'll, of course, have
to document this incident,

20:25.608 --> 20:27.630
and we'll need you to
complete an eight-hour seminar

20:27.631 --> 20:30.257
on the firm's sexual-harassment policies.

20:30.258 --> 20:32.391
Well, do I get a chance
to even defend myself?

20:32.425 --> 20:34.358
You could submit a statement.

20:34.391 --> 20:36.691
These things aren't worth the fight, Dom.

20:36.724 --> 20:39.924
Just take the seminar, and
let's all move on, okay?

20:45.091 --> 20:46.325
Can I go now?

21:04.258 --> 21:05.891
Savi, please.

21:05.924 --> 21:06.947
Did you sleep with her?

21:06.948 --> 21:08.336
She lied about...

21:08.337 --> 21:10.191
Did you sleep with her?!

21:11.158 --> 21:12.332
Yes.

21:13.143 --> 21:14.567
But it was a mistake.

21:14.568 --> 21:17.624
Get out of my office.

21:46.018 --> 21:47.458
Thanks for coming.

21:48.618 --> 21:50.584
How are you feeling?

21:50.618 --> 21:52.052
A little better.

21:52.085 --> 21:55.152
I'm... I'm sorry for bothering you.

21:55.217 --> 21:56.885
It wasn't a bother.

21:56.918 --> 21:59.718
I just felt the walls
were closing in on me.

21:59.751 --> 22:02.818
I-I-I thought my heart was
gonna beat out of my chest.

22:02.851 --> 22:04.985
And you're sure you didn't take anything?

22:05.018 --> 22:06.317
I'm sure.

22:06.351 --> 22:08.651
I-I know what you're nervous
about, but it wasn't like that.

22:08.685 --> 22:11.551
I-I just got really anxious.

22:11.584 --> 22:14.451
Do you still feel anxious?

22:16.484 --> 22:17.551
Not as bad.

22:17.584 --> 22:20.451
Would you mind if I checked your pulse?

22:23.418 --> 22:25.418
Okay.

22:27.618 --> 22:29.251
It's still a little fast.

22:29.284 --> 22:31.085
I'd like to take you to the hospital...

22:31.118 --> 22:32.184
Uh...

22:32.217 --> 22:33.785
...to check it out a little more thoroughly

22:33.786 --> 22:35.118
to make sure it's nothing physical.

22:35.152 --> 22:36.651
I've really got to get to work.

22:36.685 --> 22:38.052
You're not going to work today.

22:38.085 --> 22:41.018
If I don't show up, I'm
for sure gonna get fired,

22:41.052 --> 22:43.651
and I can't afford to get fired.

22:43.685 --> 22:45.918
I'll call your boss if I have to.

22:48.217 --> 22:52.685
Let's just take it one
step at a time, okay?

22:52.718 --> 22:53.685
Hospital?

22:56.018 --> 22:57.184
Okay.

22:57.217 --> 22:59.052
Okay.

23:33.618 --> 23:35.085
Savi?

23:36.418 --> 23:37.785
Dom slept with Toni.

23:37.818 --> 23:39.184
Oh, my God.

23:40.384 --> 23:42.518
We shouldn't talk about it over the phone.

23:44.351 --> 23:47.518
...because that is so awful.

23:47.551 --> 23:49.718
You should... get out of the office,

23:49.751 --> 23:53.052
come over here so we can
talk about it in person.

23:53.085 --> 23:54.085
I have cake.

23:54.118 --> 23:55.985
I can't leave. I have meetings all day.

23:56.018 --> 23:57.584
Can you have breakfast tomorrow?

23:57.618 --> 23:58.618
Of course.

23:58.651 --> 24:00.351
Okay.

24:10.484 --> 24:11.584
No, no. No words, though.

24:11.618 --> 24:13.317
You can't say anything.
You can't say anything.

24:13.351 --> 24:16.018
Sounds like...

24:16.052 --> 24:17.618
Come on. Um...

24:25.284 --> 24:27.403
I know! "Psycho"! It's "Psycho"!

24:28.651 --> 24:29.618
Oh, my...

24:29.651 --> 24:31.152
How did you get that?

24:31.184 --> 24:33.118
All right, all right.

24:33.152 --> 24:35.484
Who's up? Who's up?

24:35.518 --> 24:36.685
Joss, Joss, you're up. Your turn.

24:36.718 --> 24:38.317
No, no, no. I haven't had
any time alone with Joss.

24:38.351 --> 24:40.052
Scotty, you go.

24:40.085 --> 24:42.018
- Come on.
- All right. Okay.

24:42.052 --> 24:45.018
All right, Scotty. Let's see what you got.

24:46.384 --> 24:47.584
Your home is lovely.

24:47.618 --> 24:49.584
Oh, you're so sweet.

24:49.618 --> 24:51.685
I hope I'm not being too forward,

24:51.718 --> 24:55.284
but I love to shop, and I have three boys.

24:55.317 --> 24:56.718
I love shopping!

24:56.751 --> 24:58.618
Well, don't tell Scotty.

24:58.651 --> 25:00.384
He'll... he'll think it's weird.

25:00.418 --> 25:02.451
But I got you a little something.

25:02.484 --> 25:04.641
Just a little something.

25:04.651 --> 25:06.985
Oh.

25:08.484 --> 25:11.251
It's silly, isn't it? I
mean, I hope it's not weird.

25:11.284 --> 25:12.951
I-I didn't think you needed soap.

25:12.985 --> 25:15.918
I just... I thought they smelled so nice.

25:15.951 --> 25:17.718
No. They're beautiful.

25:17.751 --> 25:19.217
- Oh!
- Thank you so much.

25:19.251 --> 25:21.118
Everyone needs soap.

25:21.152 --> 25:22.317
Well, thank you.

25:22.351 --> 25:24.985
I don't think I have
ever seen my son so happy,

25:25.018 --> 25:26.184
so thank you.

25:28.018 --> 25:29.052
"The Proposal"!

25:29.085 --> 25:30.118
No!

25:30.152 --> 25:31.885
You guys, it's "Lord of the Rings."

25:31.918 --> 25:34.152
I was like this. I did like this.

25:34.184 --> 25:36.418
Dude, Middle-Earth is below us, rookie.

25:36.451 --> 25:38.052
Dude, get over here!

25:38.085 --> 25:40.818
Stop that!

25:40.851 --> 25:43.118
All right, who's gonna
help me clean this up?

25:43.152 --> 25:44.718
Come on, now. This is crazy.

26:11.484 --> 26:14.284
You never had another offer, did you?

26:14.317 --> 26:18.918
The meetings, the flowers,
the drinks... all fake.

26:18.951 --> 26:19.851
I warned you.

26:19.885 --> 26:21.685
You what?

26:21.718 --> 26:24.118
I told you you wouldn't see it happening.

26:24.152 --> 26:26.518
You'd just suddenly find yourself here...

26:26.551 --> 26:28.451
on the losing end of this game.

26:30.951 --> 26:34.551
Not from where I sit
in my partner's office.

26:34.584 --> 26:36.317
I got a slap on the wrist,

26:36.351 --> 26:39.152
but as far as I can see,
you got exactly nothing.

26:39.184 --> 26:42.152
In a month, nobody will
even remember this happened.

26:42.184 --> 26:43.618
Until you touch me again.

26:43.651 --> 26:45.818
Yeah, well, that's not gonna
happen, so you're not gonna win.

26:45.851 --> 26:48.551
I already have, you simple, silly man.

26:48.584 --> 26:51.317
All the groundwork's been laid.

26:51.351 --> 26:53.383
All you have to do is accidentally touch

26:53.384 --> 26:55.352
my knee underneath the conference table

26:55.353 --> 26:57.918
or brush against me in the hallway.

26:57.951 --> 26:59.685
Then it will be hard to deny

26:59.718 --> 27:02.251
your pattern of disturbing behavior.

27:02.284 --> 27:05.951
And I'll have no choice but
to request some compensation

27:05.985 --> 27:08.317
for all the discomfort.

27:08.351 --> 27:09.484
Why are you doing this?

27:09.518 --> 27:12.418
I like to live a certain way.

27:12.451 --> 27:14.551
- Why me?
- Oh, it's nothing personal.

27:14.584 --> 27:16.751
You were just the newest partner...

27:16.785 --> 27:18.651
the easiest target, you know?

27:18.685 --> 27:21.785
But I can't say it hasn't been a pleasure

27:21.818 --> 27:24.951
doing business with you.

27:24.985 --> 27:26.785
Night, Dom.

28:07.687 --> 28:09.119
Hey.

28:09.153 --> 28:11.286
Hey.

28:11.320 --> 28:13.020
I'm sorry.

28:13.054 --> 28:15.219
Sorry for what?

28:15.253 --> 28:17.820
You know, when we were talking
about me meeting your family

28:17.853 --> 28:19.820
and how you wanted it all to go.

28:21.386 --> 28:23.987
I handled it all wrong, babe.

28:24.020 --> 28:25.054
It's okay.

28:25.086 --> 28:26.420
No, it's not.

28:26.453 --> 28:30.020
Honey, I don't think I even
understood what you meant,

28:30.054 --> 28:31.820
because...

28:31.853 --> 28:34.153
...my mom hated all of our grandparents,

28:34.186 --> 28:36.720
and she was only around
half the time, anyway,

28:36.753 --> 28:39.453
so, usually, it was just me and Savi.

28:39.486 --> 28:42.119
That's pretty sad.

28:42.153 --> 28:43.353
No. No, no.

28:43.386 --> 28:45.853
It's just... it's just different.

28:45.887 --> 28:49.653
But if I had a family that
big, who loved me that much,

28:49.687 --> 28:53.020
I would definitely care
what they thought, so...

28:53.054 --> 28:54.153
Sorry.

28:54.186 --> 28:56.720
I really love you.

28:56.753 --> 28:58.954
I love you, too.

29:00.520 --> 29:01.620
Come here.

29:01.653 --> 29:03.753
Mm.

29:03.787 --> 29:06.520
What did you think of them?

29:08.386 --> 29:11.054
There aren't words.

29:15.720 --> 29:17.687
I thought you guys were on a break.

29:17.720 --> 29:21.987
Mm. On a break, not broken up.

29:22.020 --> 29:24.420
And it doesn't make it
right. You know what I mean?

29:24.453 --> 29:25.987
And it doesn't change the fact

29:26.020 --> 29:29.687
that he chose the one person
that would hurt me the most.

29:29.720 --> 29:31.520
But it is kind of a gray area.

29:31.553 --> 29:33.787
You guys were technically not together.

29:33.820 --> 29:34.954
On a break.

29:34.987 --> 29:37.386
A break you were on partly because of Zack.

29:37.420 --> 29:40.119
Yeah, but I never slept with Zack.

29:40.153 --> 29:43.553
You had an emotional affair.
Like I said, gray area.

29:45.753 --> 29:46.954
Anything?

29:49.853 --> 29:51.119
Son of a bitch.

29:51.153 --> 29:53.353
They've been in my house!

29:54.687 --> 29:55.987
Oh...

29:56.020 --> 29:58.789
I-I, uh... I don't think
the... that it was that gray...

29:58.790 --> 30:01.653
the... area.

30:02.753 --> 30:04.054
Right.

30:06.887 --> 30:08.620
You feel betrayed.

30:08.653 --> 30:10.553
I get it. Believe me.

30:10.587 --> 30:14.687
But Dom said it was a mistake,
and I believe that he loves you.

30:14.720 --> 30:16.020
Who are you, all of a sudden?

30:16.054 --> 30:17.020
What do you mean?

30:17.054 --> 30:18.787
Being all cool with the cheating.

30:18.820 --> 30:20.954
I am not cool with the cheating.

30:20.987 --> 30:22.687
Thought it wasn't technically...

30:23.720 --> 30:25.320
Okay, to you, it was.

30:25.336 --> 30:27.096
Look, I'm just saying
it doesn't have to mean

30:27.097 --> 30:29.853
the end of your relationship
if you don't want it to.

30:29.887 --> 30:32.207
If you want to take him back,
no one will fault you for it.

30:36.253 --> 30:38.620
Oh, my God.

30:38.653 --> 30:40.320
What is it?

30:40.353 --> 30:43.386
It's Lucy's. It's in her room.

30:43.420 --> 30:45.787
They were in her room!

30:50.687 --> 30:52.020
What a night, huh?

30:52.054 --> 30:55.587
All this for an anxiety
attack... so embarrassing.

30:55.620 --> 30:57.820
I'll bet you're pretty tired.

30:57.853 --> 30:58.887
And grateful.

30:58.920 --> 31:01.119
You don't have to put me up.

31:01.153 --> 31:02.453
It's really fine.

31:02.486 --> 31:04.520
You can't go back to
that apartment of yours.

31:06.153 --> 31:08.086
Just so you know, I-I'm not totally blind.

31:08.119 --> 31:09.438
I know it's kind of crappy.

31:09.439 --> 31:13.387
It's a health risk. I should
report your landlord to the city.

31:13.720 --> 31:15.787
It's not like I wanted to live there.

31:15.820 --> 31:17.787
It was just... what I could afford.

31:17.820 --> 31:20.887
I guess I just got used to it.

31:20.920 --> 31:22.054
I know.

31:22.086 --> 31:25.820
And I know I can't live here, either.

31:25.853 --> 31:28.553
We'll figure it out, one day
at a time, starting tonight.

31:28.587 --> 31:30.054
I'll get you a fresh towel,

31:30.086 --> 31:33.386
and I think I have an
extra toothbrush somewhere.

31:33.420 --> 31:35.587
In the meantime...

31:35.620 --> 31:38.054
Think of what you want for dinner.

31:59.286 --> 32:01.353
Hey. Thanks for calling.

32:02.453 --> 32:05.020
Thanks for coming.

32:08.286 --> 32:09.553
Look, um...

32:14.386 --> 32:16.020
Savi, I-I am so sorry.

32:16.054 --> 32:19.320
I-I was drunk and pissed
off, and I-I made a mistake...

32:19.353 --> 32:20.520
the worst mistake.

32:20.553 --> 32:22.576
But it... it obviously
didn't mean anything.

32:22.577 --> 32:23.965
You know what? I-I'm sorry. I just don't

32:23.966 --> 32:25.502
think that I need to hear any more

32:25.503 --> 32:26.902
about this Toni situation.

32:27.720 --> 32:28.954
Right.

32:28.987 --> 32:32.186
Uh, the truth is...

32:33.853 --> 32:35.687
...we have bigger issues than Toni.

32:35.720 --> 32:40.420
We haven't been honest with
each other for a while...

32:40.453 --> 32:42.054
About a lot of things.

32:42.086 --> 32:44.486
Mm-hmm. Like this house.

32:44.520 --> 32:46.020
What?

32:46.054 --> 32:48.386
You didn't tell me that
you were keeping the house.

32:49.954 --> 32:52.553
We weren't speaking when
I made that decision.

32:52.587 --> 32:54.054
But... but we were after.

32:54.119 --> 32:56.920
You know, and it was still
a decision that affected me...

32:56.954 --> 32:58.281
affected us.

32:58.282 --> 33:00.620
We talked about a plan, remember?

33:00.653 --> 33:01.920
Living together?

33:01.954 --> 33:04.520
Yeah, I-I wasn't thinking about you,

33:04.553 --> 33:06.920
about not being with you.

33:06.954 --> 33:09.186
It's not what it was about.

33:09.219 --> 33:12.954
No, and that's the problem.
It's never about me with you.

33:12.987 --> 33:15.219
I mean, even Zack... you weren't seeing him

33:15.253 --> 33:18.169
because you were mad at me
or because you were thinking

33:18.170 --> 33:19.633
that there was something
I wasn't giving you.

33:19.634 --> 33:20.687
Would that have made it better?

33:20.720 --> 33:22.520
Yeah. Yeah, it would.

33:22.553 --> 33:25.920
Because I'm... I'm always
thinking about you.

33:25.954 --> 33:28.219
Were you thinking about me the other night,

33:28.253 --> 33:30.253
when you were with Toni?

33:30.286 --> 33:31.386
Absolutely.

33:31.420 --> 33:34.553
I was angry with you, hurt by you.

33:34.587 --> 33:36.486
And I know that doesn't excuse it,

33:36.520 --> 33:38.219
but the truth is, for me...

33:38.253 --> 33:41.954
for me, it's always about you,

33:43.054 --> 33:44.853
About... about us.

33:44.887 --> 33:47.219
And that's not the way it is for you.

33:47.253 --> 33:48.286
It's never been.

33:48.320 --> 33:49.920
That is not fair.

33:49.954 --> 33:51.353
You're telling me.

33:51.386 --> 33:54.954
No, y-you know... you're right.

33:56.753 --> 34:01.853
I was never fully about us.

34:01.887 --> 34:03.853
But you know why that is?

34:03.887 --> 34:07.086
Because I didn't really
have that luxury, Dom.

34:07.119 --> 34:11.420
There was always another us
that I had to worry about.

34:11.453 --> 34:16.186
You know, I was also... I
was also an us with Harry.

34:16.219 --> 34:22.148
So there were consequences
and... and... and wreckage.

34:23.219 --> 34:29.215
I just couldn't be as... as
clean and carefree, like you.

34:31.853 --> 34:35.620
That's what you wanted from me, Savi.

34:35.652 --> 34:39.420
I was a second chance, a clean start.

34:39.453 --> 34:43.353
If you wanted all that other baggage...

34:43.386 --> 34:45.620
You would have stayed.

35:11.054 --> 35:13.553
We never had a chance, did we?

35:23.386 --> 35:25.653
I'm so sorry.

35:27.787 --> 35:29.787
Yeah, me too.

35:46.086 --> 35:47.420
So? How was it?

35:48.953 --> 35:52.273
It was horrible. Everyone was amazing.

35:53.008 --> 35:54.647
- Come again?
- Oh, yeah.

35:54.648 --> 35:56.914
His... his mom gave me
these adorable little soaps,

35:56.915 --> 35:59.116
and Grandma June taught
me how to play mah-jongg,

35:59.148 --> 36:00.515
and Uncle Carl invited me

36:00.548 --> 36:02.715
to cousin Katie's sweet
16 party next month.

36:02.749 --> 36:05.715
Whew. Wow. Look at you.

36:05.749 --> 36:07.982
From the girl who couldn't
commit to a second date

36:08.016 --> 36:10.418
to cousin Katie's sweet 16.

36:10.419 --> 36:11.265
Exactly!

36:11.266 --> 36:13.511
Harry, it's like I'm suddenly

36:13.512 --> 36:15.261
in the middle of this life with this guy,

36:15.262 --> 36:17.049
and I don't even understand how I got here.

36:17.904 --> 36:20.637
I just... I really don't think I can do it.

36:20.671 --> 36:22.261
Well, I hate to break it to you, Joss,

36:22.262 --> 36:24.394
but, uh... you're already doing it.

36:24.395 --> 36:26.481
No, because I'm obviously
gonna screw it up, right?

36:26.482 --> 36:28.524
- You are, with that attitude.
- But I always do, Harry.

36:28.525 --> 36:29.972
But this time, you know,

36:29.973 --> 36:31.904
it's not just gonna be
one person that gets hurt.

36:31.905 --> 36:33.403
If Scott and I break up, I have to break up

36:33.404 --> 36:36.042
with the whole family, the whole damn clan.

36:36.043 --> 36:39.609
I mean, my point is... you were right.

36:39.643 --> 36:41.210
Uh, about what?

36:42.843 --> 36:45.576
I don't do serious.

36:45.609 --> 36:48.709
Joss...

36:48.743 --> 36:50.442
Look here.

36:50.476 --> 36:52.843
You have found a good thing.

36:52.876 --> 36:54.776
Just...

36:54.809 --> 36:56.743
Just go with it.

36:58.076 --> 36:59.643
It is good, isn't it?

36:59.676 --> 37:01.976
I mean, Scott... h-he's great.

37:02.010 --> 37:04.377
His family is great.

37:04.409 --> 37:06.598
But this... don't you find it weird?

37:06.599 --> 37:07.920
Like, why was the guy even single

37:07.943 --> 37:09.367
when I met him in the first place?

37:09.368 --> 37:11.101
Maybe has some... some horrible thing

37:11.134 --> 37:12.702
that I don't even know about yet.

37:13.744 --> 37:16.101
Or maybe he was just waiting
his whole life for you.

37:24.668 --> 37:27.763
They didn't have any splenda,
so I got you sugar instead.

37:27.764 --> 37:30.098
Anna's staying with me.
I don't know for how long.

37:30.131 --> 37:31.330
I gave her a bathrobe,

37:31.364 --> 37:33.698
and we shared an order
of pad Thai last night.

37:33.731 --> 37:35.798
And before you say it, yes, this is bad.

37:35.831 --> 37:37.197
How?

37:37.230 --> 37:40.698
She had a severe panic attack
and ended up at my house.

37:40.731 --> 37:42.230
Okay...?

37:42.264 --> 37:43.531
I couldn't help myself.

37:43.564 --> 37:45.531
She called, and I had to go to her.

37:45.564 --> 37:47.798
But then her apartment was just so awful

37:47.831 --> 37:49.764
that I had to, you know,
get her out of there.

37:49.765 --> 37:52.764
Then I had nowhere else
to take her, so I took her.

37:54.018 --> 37:55.431
What's wrong with me?

37:55.464 --> 37:57.098
Nothing.

37:57.131 --> 38:00.431
Did you miss the part where
Anna's staying on my couch?

38:00.464 --> 38:01.564
No.

38:01.597 --> 38:04.004
You... you are who
you've always been, Karen,

38:04.005 --> 38:05.781
and you're doing what you've always done.

38:06.571 --> 38:07.292
I am?

38:07.293 --> 38:09.194
I remembered this thing
from back in grad school.

38:09.195 --> 38:11.330
Remember that patient
you had as an intern...

38:11.364 --> 38:13.597
15-year-old kid, wasn't
showing up for school?

38:13.631 --> 38:14.597
Dante.

38:14.631 --> 38:15.664
You were so frustrated

38:15.698 --> 38:17.497
'cause nothing was really motivating him.

38:17.531 --> 38:20.330
And I remember when you told
me you realized something...

38:20.364 --> 38:22.497
that it wasn't actually about motivation.

38:22.531 --> 38:23.798
His mom had two jobs.

38:23.831 --> 38:25.838
He literally had nobody around

38:25.839 --> 38:27.631
to wake him up for school in the morning.

38:27.664 --> 38:29.165
So you bought him an alarm clock.

38:29.197 --> 38:32.131
I got in trouble for that...
buying a gift for a patient.

38:32.165 --> 38:34.330
And it worked. The kid started
showing up for class on time.

38:34.364 --> 38:36.264
And he graduated on time.

38:36.297 --> 38:39.464
You have always led with your heart,

38:40.631 --> 38:41.764
despite the rules.

38:41.798 --> 38:44.798
Now, whether that's the
appropriate thing to do

38:44.831 --> 38:46.431
as a therapist...

38:46.464 --> 38:48.631
Okay, it's definitely not
the appropriate thing to do

38:48.664 --> 38:49.831
as a therapist,

38:49.864 --> 38:52.531
but it's who you are.

38:53.731 --> 38:55.264
And that's why I love you.

38:57.297 --> 38:58.464
You love me?

38:58.497 --> 39:00.264
Unfortunately.

39:00.297 --> 39:03.431
I think I'm gonna have
to break another rule.

39:21.497 --> 39:23.065
Surprise.

39:23.098 --> 39:24.764
Oh.

39:24.798 --> 39:26.297
You're home early.

39:26.330 --> 39:28.297
Yeah, well, you know, I
didn't have any surgeries,

39:28.330 --> 39:30.503
so I figured I'd clear my afternoon

39:30.504 --> 39:31.984
and see what my girlfriend was up to.

39:32.698 --> 39:35.394
Your girlfriend is up to her
eyeballs in accounts payable.

39:35.395 --> 39:36.196
Hmm.

39:36.197 --> 39:37.330
Does she have time for this?

39:37.974 --> 39:40.053
Maybe.

39:40.054 --> 39:41.236
You were such a good sport yesterday,

39:41.237 --> 39:43.597
I wanted to do something to make you smile.

39:43.631 --> 39:45.165
Aww.

39:45.197 --> 39:47.254
Hmm. I'm smiling.

39:48.131 --> 39:49.397
Well, try them on.

39:53.098 --> 39:54.497
Ow!

39:54.531 --> 39:56.631
There's something in this one.

39:56.664 --> 39:58.297
- Ow. Yeah.
- What is it?

40:03.864 --> 40:05.431
That's Grandma June's.

40:05.464 --> 40:07.998
She, um...

40:08.031 --> 40:10.698
She said that you were the only woman

40:10.731 --> 40:12.131
she would give it to.

40:14.197 --> 40:15.964
Oh, my God.

40:20.864 --> 40:24.031
Josslyn Carver...

40:24.065 --> 40:26.597
Will you marry me?

40:28.564 --> 40:29.531
Yes!

40:29.564 --> 40:31.364
Yes!

40:34.197 --> 40:36.330
Oh, my God.

40:44.431 --> 40:45.431
Ma'am?

40:45.464 --> 40:47.846
April Malloy here to see Agent Thomas.

40:47.847 --> 40:49.112
Do you have an appointment?

40:49.113 --> 40:51.943
I am here to find out why the FBI bugged

40:51.944 --> 40:53.613
my 12-year-old
daughter's bedroom.

40:53.614 --> 40:55.713
Do I need an appointment for that?

40:58.480 --> 41:02.247
Yes, sir. I've got an April Malloy here...

41:02.280 --> 41:04.347
Yes, sir.

41:04.380 --> 41:06.646
Okay, ma'am, you can follow me.

41:32.779 --> 41:34.282
Daniel?
