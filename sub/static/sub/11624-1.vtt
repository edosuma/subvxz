03:28.300 --> 03:30.567

THE VICTORY

03:32.200 --> 03:35.100
OF REASON
OVER RIGHTEOUSNESS.

03:37.233 --> 03:40.200
IT'S VERY EASY
TO LOSE FAITH IN THE SYSTEM

03:40.233 --> 03:43.367
WHERE THE STRONG
TREAD ON THE WEAK.

03:43.400 --> 03:46.000

TO MY CONSCIENCE.

THAT I LIKED HIM VERY WELL.

WOULDN'T GO AWAY.

05:19.033 --> 05:20.967

05:21.000 --> 05:23.167
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS
THEY TEACH YOU

05:23.200 --> 05:26.267
IS THAT MORALITY IS
A PRIVATE AND COSTLY LUXURY.

06:21.133 --> 06:23.000
MY FATHER USED TO SAY

06:23.033 --> 06:25.300
THAT JURISPRUDENCE
WASN'T EQUIVOCAL

06:25.333 --> 06:27.367
AS LONG AS YOU KEPT IN MIND

YOUR CLIENT?

07:22.200 --> 07:23.167
YES.

07:23.200 --> 07:24.767
AND HIS REACTION
WAS...

07:24.800 --> 07:25.967
HE WAS UNHAPPY.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.967
I SHOULD THINK
HE WOULD BE.

IS LOSING IT, THURMAN.

08:10.200 --> 08:11.967
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME?

A MONUMENTAL MISTAKE,

08:14.200 --> 08:16.167

08:16.200 --> 08:18.933
MY CLIENT
WAS THURMAN PARKS III.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.033
I GREW UP WITH THURMAN.

08:23.067 --> 08:25.433
HIS DADDY WAS A FORMER
MAYOR OF NEW ORLEANS

08:25.467 --> 08:28.067
AND ONE NASTY SON
OF A CAN OF HUMAN CUR.

08:28.100 --> 08:31.200
BUT THURMAN
WAS EVEN MEANER.

08:31.233 --> 08:33.167
HE WAS ON TRIAL FOR
THE BRUTAL RAPE AND MURDER

TO JUDGE GUILT AND INNOCENCE.

08:52.867 --> 08:54.067

HAS THE BETTER LAWYER.

KNEW THURMAN WAS GUILTY,

NOT TO THINK ABOUT THAT.

TO CUT OFF THE BAD LEG.

WILL BE RAPED

16:20.633 --> 16:22.600
OR MOLESTED
IN THIS COUNTRY?

16:22.633 --> 16:24.700

16:34.000 --> 16:35.967
I SHOULD BE PROUD

TO PROTECT THE INNOCENT
AND PUNISH THE GUILTY.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.767

HAVE BEEN PROUD.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.467
THEY TOOK YOUR LICENSE,
NOT YOUR BALLS.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.867
THERE'S SO MANY THINGS
YOU CAN DO.

17:11.900 --> 17:13.032

IS KILL ALL THE LAWYERS."

AFTER THE BAD GUYS,

THAT IT'S THE LAWYERS

43:28.000 --> 43:29.100
SIT DOWN.

43:30.400 --> 43:31.600
CAN YOU ACCESS FILES

43:31.633 --> 43:32.967
FROM THE OTHER
POLICE DEPARTMENTS

43:33.000 --> 43:34.967
IN THE SURROUNDING STATES?
YES, SIR.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.567
CAN YOU ACCESS THOSE FILES
AS PER VICTIMS' OCCUPATIONS?

43:37.600 --> 43:38.967
UH...

43:39.000 --> 43:39.967
YES, SIR. I--

43:40.000 --> 43:41.033
THEN TYPE IN THERE
"LAWYER."

43:42.200 --> 43:43.567
LAWYER?

43:43.600 --> 43:45.467
THAT'S RIGHT. LAWYER.

43:51.600 --> 43:53.367
Clifford: START
WITH MISSISSIPPI--

43:53.400 --> 43:54.600
BILOXI.

43:56.533 --> 43:59.067
M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I.

44:05.000 --> 44:06.500
ALL RIGHT, BRING IT ON.

44:15.067 --> 44:16.400
LAWSON RUSSELL?

44:16.433 --> 44:17.867
WHO WANTS TO KNOW?

44:17.900 --> 44:20.067
I DO. I'M THE MOTHERFUCKER
YOU'VE BEEN PLAYIN' WITH.

44:20.100 --> 44:21.967
HEY!

44:22.000 --> 44:22.967
HEY!

44:23.000 --> 44:24.400
GET HIS LEFT ONE.

44:24.433 --> 44:25.967
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

44:26.000 --> 44:28.233
YOU'RE GOIN' DOWNTOWN.

44:28.267 --> 44:29.800
ON WHAT CHARGE?

44:31.000 --> 44:31.967
ARROGANCE.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.267
OK.

44:34.333 --> 44:35.867
RIGHT THIS WAY.

44:37.600 --> 44:39.900
NOW, WATCH YOUR HEAD.

44:39.933 --> 44:43.300
READ HIM HIS RIGHTS
AND FASTEN HIS SEAT BELT.

44:49.933 --> 44:52.500
[SIREN]

45:06.000 --> 45:08.500
Lawson: I HAD NO IDEA
WHAT WAS GOING ON,

45:08.533 --> 45:11.100
BUT WHEN YOU'RE GUILTY,
YOU EXPECT THE WORST.

45:31.400 --> 45:34.467
AH, YES. BILLY RAY.

45:34.500 --> 45:35.933
HELLO, LAWSON.

45:37.600 --> 45:39.667
GUESS YOU ALREADY
MET DETECTIVE DUBOSE.

45:39.700 --> 45:42.067
YEAH. I OFFERED HIM
A BREATH MINT,

45:42.100 --> 45:43.233
BUT YOU KNOW
HOW HE IS.

45:43.267 --> 45:44.800
WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

45:44.833 --> 45:46.000
NO.

45:47.100 --> 45:48.500
BUT IT'S MY JOB.

45:50.600 --> 45:52.833
IT'S ABOUT
YOUR BOOK, LAWSON.

45:52.867 --> 45:54.033
WHAT ABOUT IT?

45:54.067 --> 45:58.133
WELL, IT SEEMS
IT'S ALL TRUE.

45:59.600 --> 46:01.300
WHAT?

46:01.333 --> 46:03.667
IT'S ALL TRUE.

46:03.700 --> 46:06.367
ALL 5 OF THE MURDERS IN
YOUR BOOK REALLY HAPPENED,

46:06.400 --> 46:07.567
JUST AS YOU DESCRIBED THEM,

46:07.600 --> 46:09.367
RIGHT DOWN
TO THE LAST DETAIL.

46:09.400 --> 46:13.800
ALL OF THE VICTIMS
WERE LAWYERS.

46:13.833 --> 46:16.800
ALL OF THE DEATHS WERE
LISTED AS ACCIDENTS OR SUICIDES,

46:16.833 --> 46:18.000
EXCEPT FOR THE FIRST ONE,

46:18.033 --> 46:20.167
WHICH APPEARED TO BE
A FAILED ROBBERY ATTEMPT,

46:20.200 --> 46:23.167
AND ALL OF THE MURDERS
ARE CONNECTED

46:23.200 --> 46:24.967
BY A SINGLE MOTIVE--

46:25.000 --> 46:26.700
EACH OF THE VICTIMS

46:26.733 --> 46:29.367
HAD JUST WON
A MAJOR LEGAL VICTORY

46:29.400 --> 46:31.367
FOR AN UNSAVORY CLIENT,

46:31.400 --> 46:33.600
JUST AS YOU DESCRIBE
IN YOUR BOOK.

46:33.633 --> 46:34.667
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

46:34.700 --> 46:37.067
I MEAN, IT'S SOME KIND
OF COINCIDENCE.

46:37.100 --> 46:38.567
OH...

46:38.600 --> 46:40.500
I'M AFRAID IT'S NOT.

46:42.200 --> 46:46.567
SEE, WE'RE NOT TALKIN' ABOUT
SIMILARITIES HERE, LAWSON.

46:46.600 --> 46:48.767
WE ARE TALKIN'...

46:48.800 --> 46:50.967
ABOUT EXACT DETAILS
OF EACH CRIME,

46:51.000 --> 46:54.467
DETAILS THAT WERE NEVER
RELEASED TO THE PRESS.

46:54.500 --> 46:57.767
I MEAN,
MINUTE DETAILS, MAN,

46:57.800 --> 47:00.233
RIGHT DOWN
TO THE COLOR OF THE CAR.

47:00.267 --> 47:03.367
WE ARE TALKIN' ABOUT THINGS
ONLY THE VICTIMS

47:03.400 --> 47:05.900
OR THE KILLER
COULD'VE KNOWN.

47:09.000 --> 47:12.367
SO I NEED TO ASK YOU,
LAWSON,

47:12.400 --> 47:16.067
WHERE DID YOU GET
ALL OF THE INFORMATION

47:16.100 --> 47:17.667
FOR YOUR BOOK?

47:17.700 --> 47:20.900
Lawson: MY LEGS WENT NUMB,
AND I COULDN'T BREATHE.

47:23.800 --> 47:26.367
I'D BEEN SO CAREFUL.

47:26.400 --> 47:28.467
I'D DESTROYED THE ONLY
EVIDENCE THAT COULD PROVE

47:28.500 --> 47:30.100
THAT I DIDN'T
WRITE THE BOOK.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.833
OH, OF COURSE, THERE'S
THE DISTINCT POSSIBILITY

47:35.867 --> 47:38.100
THAT NOBODY TOLD YOU
ANY OF THE DETAILS

47:38.133 --> 47:39.867
OF THESE MURDERS.

47:42.000 --> 47:43.800
THERE'S
A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY

47:43.833 --> 47:45.700
THAT ONE DISGUSTED,
DISGRUNTLED,

47:45.733 --> 47:47.233
DISBARRED LAWYER,

47:47.267 --> 47:49.400
ANGRY AT THE SYSTEM
THAT SHUT HIM OUT,

47:49.433 --> 47:51.767
TOOK REVENGE
ON THE VERY MEN

47:51.800 --> 47:54.000
WHO REFUSED TO MAKE
THE SAME MORAL SACRIFICE

47:54.033 --> 47:55.067
HE DID.

47:55.100 --> 47:57.233
NOBODY HAD TO TELL YOU
ANY OF THESE DETAILS

47:57.267 --> 48:00.433
BECAUSE YOU WERE THERE,
MR. RUSSELL.

48:00.467 --> 48:02.233
YOU KILLED THOSE MEN.

48:02.267 --> 48:04.733
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND.

48:12.000 --> 48:13.667
WHY'D YOU
SEND ME YOUR BOOK?

48:13.700 --> 48:15.767
WHAT?

48:15.800 --> 48:18.467
IS THAT NOT
YOUR HANDWRITIN'?

48:18.500 --> 48:20.367
YOU JUST COULDN'T
STAND THE IDEA

48:20.400 --> 48:21.467
OF PEOPLE NOT KNOWING

48:21.500 --> 48:22.567
ABOUT
YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS,

48:22.600 --> 48:23.767
COULD YOU?

48:23.800 --> 48:25.167
I MEAN, WHAT'S THE SENSE

48:25.200 --> 48:26.967
OF COMMITTING
THE PERFECT CRIME

48:27.000 --> 48:28.367
IF NOBODY
KNOWS ABOUT IT?

48:28.400 --> 48:31.167
SO YOU SET IT DOWN

48:31.200 --> 48:34.967
DETAIL-PER-DETAIL,
DIDN'T YOU?

48:35.000 --> 48:36.967
AND YOU SENT A COPY
TO THE ONE PERSON

48:37.000 --> 48:38.567
YOU KNEW
COULD UNDERSTAND IT:

48:38.600 --> 48:40.467
THE DETECTIVE THAT
WORKED THE FIRST CASE.

48:42.200 --> 48:45.667
YOU SENT ME THAT BOOK,
DIDN'T YOU, COUNSELOR?

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
BECAUSE YOU WANTED ME
TO CATCH YOU.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.067
DIDN'T YOU?

48:55.400 --> 48:58.500
I'D LIKE TO SPEAK
TO AN ATTORNEY.

48:58.533 --> 48:59.967
HMM...

49:00.000 --> 49:02.700
GOOD LUCK FINDIN' ONE.

49:23.000 --> 49:24.567
THANKS FOR COMING.

49:24.600 --> 49:26.967
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOIN' ON, LAWSON?

49:27.000 --> 49:27.967
[SIGHS]

49:28.000 --> 49:29.967
A REALLY BIG
MISUNDERSTANDING.

49:30.000 --> 49:33.367
YOU ARE BEING INVESTIGATED
FOR 5 COUNTS OF HOMICIDE.

49:33.400 --> 49:35.000
WELL, I'M TELLIN' YOU,
IT'S SOME KIND OF MISTAKE.

49:35.033 --> 49:37.567
NO. THERE'S NO MISTAKE.

49:37.600 --> 49:39.367
THAT'S THE LIST
OF VICTIMS.

49:39.400 --> 49:41.367
THEY DIED EXACTLY
HOW YOU DESCRIBED IT

49:41.400 --> 49:42.767
IN YOUR BOOK.

49:42.800 --> 49:45.233
I DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY,
I PROMISE YOU THAT.

49:45.267 --> 49:47.167
THEN YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO THEM

49:47.200 --> 49:48.967
WHERE YOU GOT
YOUR INFORMATION.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.167
AM I BEING CHARGED?
NO, NOT YET.

49:51.200 --> 49:53.100
THEY WANT TO HEAR
YOUR STORY FIRST.

50:00.600 --> 50:02.367
THEY WON'T BELIEVE IT.

50:02.400 --> 50:04.100
TRY ME, THEN.

50:07.133 --> 50:08.833
WHAT ARE MY OPTIONS?

50:08.867 --> 50:10.967
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.500
YOU HAVE TO COOPERATE.

50:12.533 --> 50:14.100
TELL THEM WHERE YOU
GOT YOUR FACTS.

50:14.133 --> 50:15.233
OH!

50:15.267 --> 50:17.967
THE LAW DOES NOT RESPECT
PROTECTION OF SOURCES

50:18.000 --> 50:19.067
IN CAPITAL CRIMES.

50:19.100 --> 50:21.567
HELL,
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT.

50:21.600 --> 50:23.833
IT'S OBSTRUCTION
OF JUSTICE,

50:23.867 --> 50:25.967
PLUS ACCESSORY
AFTER THE FACT,

50:26.000 --> 50:27.167
HARBORING A FUGITIVE.

50:27.200 --> 50:29.067
MAN, IF THEY REALLY
WANT TO GET NASTY:

50:29.100 --> 50:30.167
INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER.

50:30.200 --> 50:32.000
YOU'LL GO TO JAIL,
LAWSON.

50:32.033 --> 50:33.200
OK, OK, ALL RIGHT.

50:33.233 --> 50:35.800
TELL THEM THAT I NEED TIME
TO CONFER WITH COUNSEL

50:35.833 --> 50:37.400
AND TO PREPARE A STATEMENT.

50:37.433 --> 50:39.100
TELL THEM I'LL BE MORE
THAN HAPPY TO COOPERATE

50:39.133 --> 50:42.567
IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE,
INCLUDING NAMING MY SOURCE,

50:42.600 --> 50:44.167
BUT I NEED OUT OF HERE NOW.

50:44.200 --> 50:45.367
LAWSON--

50:45.400 --> 50:46.667
POPE, PLEASE...

50:46.700 --> 50:48.033
JUST DO IT.

50:50.000 --> 50:51.100
MAN.

50:59.600 --> 51:01.000
HE'S GUILTY.

51:02.200 --> 51:04.067
HOW CAN YOU TELL?

51:04.100 --> 51:06.667
WATCH. HE'LL LOOK BACK.

51:06.700 --> 51:08.567
WHEN THE PERP'S HOLDIN',
THEY ALWAYS LOOK BACK.

51:08.600 --> 51:09.767
DUBOSE HERE.

51:09.800 --> 51:11.567
RABBIT'S ON THE TRACK.

51:11.600 --> 51:13.167
SET THE HOUNDS LOOSE.

51:13.200 --> 51:14.767
BILLY RAY, OLD BUDDY,

51:14.800 --> 51:16.567
I NEED A SEARCH WARRANT.

51:16.600 --> 51:19.200
OH, I KNOW JUST THE JUDGE.

51:30.133 --> 51:32.400
SATISFIED?

51:32.433 --> 51:33.967
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

51:34.000 --> 51:35.600
Lawson: BUT IT WAS TRUE.

51:35.633 --> 51:37.967
EACH ONE OF THE MURDERS
IN THE BOOK

51:38.000 --> 51:39.900
DOCUMENTED
AN ACTUAL KILLING.

51:43.400 --> 51:45.967
I WAS--
TO USE THE VERNACULAR--

51:46.000 --> 51:47.167
FUCKED.

51:47.200 --> 51:49.100
I DIDN'T WRITE THE BOOK.

51:49.133 --> 51:50.067
WHAT?

51:50.100 --> 51:52.967
I DIDN'T WRITE THE BOOK.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.067
Patron: SHH! SHH!

51:54.100 --> 51:55.467
IT WAS GIVEN TO ME

51:55.500 --> 51:57.067
BY AN OLD MAN
I MET IN KEY WEST.

51:57.100 --> 51:59.100
HE GAVE ME THE ORIGINAL
MANUSCRIPT TO READ,

51:59.133 --> 52:02.067
AND THEN HE DIED
OF A HEART ATTACK.

52:02.100 --> 52:04.967
I GOT GREEDY.
I PUT MY NAME ON IT.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.067
I SUBMITTED IT,

52:06.100 --> 52:09.900
AND IT
BUP BUP BUP BUP!

52:09.933 --> 52:12.400
YOU EXPECT ME
TO BELIEVE THAT?

52:12.433 --> 52:13.967
NO, NO. HELL,
I DON'T EVEN BELIEVE IT,

52:14.000 --> 52:15.167
BUT IT'S TRUE.

52:15.200 --> 52:16.967
LISTEN, YOU SAID YOURSELF
WHEN YOU READ IT

52:17.000 --> 52:18.967
IT DIDN'T SOUND
ANYTHING LIKE ME.

52:19.000 --> 52:22.200
I'M GUILTY OF PLAGIARISM,
NOT MURDER.

52:22.233 --> 52:25.367
SO WHERE'S
THE ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPT?

52:25.400 --> 52:27.967
I BURNED IT.

52:28.000 --> 52:28.967
GREAT.

52:29.000 --> 52:30.967
SO THE OLD MAN
FROM KEY WEST

52:31.000 --> 52:32.567
IS THE REAL KILLER,

52:32.600 --> 52:34.300
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE TELLIN' ME?

52:34.333 --> 52:35.567
YES.

52:35.600 --> 52:37.767
MAYBE. I DON'T KNOW.

52:37.800 --> 52:39.067
MAYBE HE
JUST KNEW THE KILLER.

52:42.600 --> 52:43.967
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.100
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO BELIEVE.

52:47.467 --> 52:49.100
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

52:49.133 --> 52:51.600
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD
SAY ANY MORE TO ME.

52:51.633 --> 52:53.867
WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?
THIS IS PRIVILEGED.

52:53.900 --> 52:55.567
NO, IT IS NOT.

52:55.600 --> 52:57.967
I AM NOT REPRESENTING
YOU IN THIS.

52:58.000 --> 52:59.700
OH, POPE.

52:59.733 --> 53:01.233
I THINK YOU'D BETTER
SEEK OTHER COUNSEL.

53:01.267 --> 53:02.233
NO. POPE, LISTEN.

53:02.267 --> 53:03.167
POPE, LISTEN,
LISTEN, LISTEN.

53:03.200 --> 53:04.867
I'M SORRY, LAWSON.

53:04.900 --> 53:06.867
I NEED YOUR HELP.

53:09.600 --> 53:10.967
THERE WAS A TIME

53:11.000 --> 53:13.167
WHEN I WOULD HAVE
DONE ANYTHING FOR YOU,

53:13.200 --> 53:17.000
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHO
YOU ARE ANYMORE, LAWSON.

53:17.033 --> 53:18.967
I CAN'T HELP YOU.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.900
I'M NOT SURE
ANYBODY CAN.

53:26.867 --> 53:29.033
POPE.

53:29.067 --> 53:30.000
POPE.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.700
YOUR PARENTS
SURE MUST BE PROUD.

54:00.467 --> 54:01.600
VERY FUNNY.

54:09.800 --> 54:11.067
MAY I HELP YOU?

54:13.100 --> 54:15.900
HEY! WHAT THE HELL'S
GOIN' ON HERE?!

54:15.933 --> 54:18.700
MAYBE THIS'LL EXPLAIN
THINGS, COUNSEL.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.367
NOW, LET ME ASK YOU,

54:22.400 --> 54:24.167
A FINE LEGAL MIND
LIKE YOURSELF,

54:24.200 --> 54:25.833
ARE YOU COOPERATIN'?

54:25.867 --> 54:27.167
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT--

54:27.200 --> 54:28.867
I'M COOPERATING.

54:28.900 --> 54:29.967
EXCELLENT!

54:30.000 --> 54:31.567
OH, BOYS!

54:31.600 --> 54:34.267
MR. RUSSELL'S
JUST GIVEN US PERMISSION

54:34.300 --> 54:36.967
TO BE PARTICULARLY
DESTRUCTIVE.

54:37.000 --> 54:37.967
CARRY ON.

54:38.000 --> 54:39.267
[GLASS SHATTERS]

55:01.033 --> 55:03.800
LIKE A DRINK, DETECTIVE?

55:03.833 --> 55:06.567
NAH. NEVER TOUCH IT.

55:06.600 --> 55:07.733
MAKES ME HAPPY.

55:16.033 --> 55:20.433
YOU KNOW, RUSSELL,
I KIND OF ADMIRE YOU.

55:20.467 --> 55:22.200
YEAH.

55:22.233 --> 55:25.367
I THINK
IT'S A HELL OF AN IDEA,

55:25.400 --> 55:27.700
KNOCKING OFF THOSE
SCUMBAG LAWYERS,

55:27.733 --> 55:30.900
LETTING ALL THESE
GUILTY MEN GO FREE

55:30.933 --> 55:32.967
TO CONTINUE

NO, I'M
THE FUCKING EASTER BUNNY.

01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:22.133

TOWARDS SOMETHING ELSE."

OF THE 5 LAWYERS MURDERED.

01:23:53.100 --> 01:23:55.767
I REASONED THAT IF THERE
WAS ANY PERSONAL CONNECTION

01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:57.567
BETWEEN THE VICTIMS
AND THE KILLER,

01:23:57.600 --> 01:23:59.500
IT WOULD BE
WITH THE FIRST MURDER.

01:23:59.533 --> 01:24:01.667

NEARLY 3 YEARS

WAS BORN.

WELL...

01:27:04.133 --> 01:27:07.433
I GOT TO TELL YOU,
I'M IMPRESSED.

YOU HAVE GIVEN ME
QUITE A DAY,

WHEN YOU CALLED
JUDGE BANNING,

IT IMPRESSED ME SO MUCH

THAT I DECIDED
NOT TO KILL YOU.

01:27:35.467 --> 01:27:37.767

COMPELLED TO SHARE IT.

AFTER HE KILLED THEM.

01:28:24.667 --> 01:28:28.567
YOU SEE, I COULD TELL
FROM HIS EYES

01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:31.067
THAT HE WAS REMORSEFUL
FOR WHAT HE'D DONE.

01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:36.033
BUT HIS LAWYER...
HIS LAWYER SMILED...

01:28:36.067 --> 01:28:38.367

ON THE BACK.

SOMETHING, LAWSON.

I FELT A RAGE INSIDE OF
ME, AND I SWEAR TO GOD,

I TRIED TO PUT IT
OUT OF MY MIND.

01:28:48.433 --> 01:28:51.000
I TRIED TO TURN
THE OTHER CHEEK.

"VENGEANCE IS MINE,
SAITH THE LORD."

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.867
BUT I COULDN'T
WAIT FOR IT.

PRACTICING LAW!

01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:00.267
HE WAS HIDING BEHIND IT!

01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:03.000
HE WAS USING IT
AS A HAMMER

01:29:03.033 --> 01:29:05.400
