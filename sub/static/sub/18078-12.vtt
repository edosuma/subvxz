00:01.484 --> 00:04.113
Who knows better
about Mr. Tree...

00:04.196 --> 00:09.952
than our bestest buddy,
Ruff the Bear?

00:11.203 --> 00:13.038
I ain't taking no orders
from no chipmunk.

00:13.163 --> 00:16.667
Let's do it. I want to waste
that chipmunk once and for all.

00:17.459 --> 00:20.337
I send you out
to whack a chipmunk...

00:20.420 --> 00:22.381
and you come back
with a mouthful of excuses.

00:22.464 --> 00:24.967
You can't hurt me.
You can't hurt my people.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.387
They're snatching
Uncle Buckle-Up!

00:28.428 --> 00:31.807
Why would somebody resort to
kidnapping over a few stuffed animals?

00:31.932 --> 00:35.018
Their heads are not supposed to come
off until we want them to come off.

00:35.144 --> 00:37.062
Then we'll take care
of all of them.

00:37.312 --> 00:38.814
All of them, including...

00:38.897 --> 00:40.357
Chipmunks are a dime a dozen.

00:40.440 --> 00:43.527
An actor can tell when his
career's coming to an end.

00:46.989 --> 00:49.491
<i>In 1972,
a crack commando unit...</i>

00:49.616 --> 00:51.160
<i>was sent to prison
by a military court...</i>

00:51.285 --> 00:52.661
<i>for a crime they didn't commit.</i>

00:52.786 --> 00:53.912
<i>These men promptly escaped...</i>

00:54.037 --> 00:55.622
<i>from a maximum-security
stockade...</i>

00:55.747 --> 00:57.332
<i>to the Los Angeles underground.</i>

00:57.416 --> 00:58.959
<i>Today, still wanted
by the government...</i>

00:59.042 --> 01:00.961
<i>they survive
as soldiers of fortune.</i>

01:01.044 --> 01:03.547
<i>If you have a problem,
if no one else can help...</i>

01:03.630 --> 01:04.923
<i>and if you can find them...</i>

01:05.007 --> 01:07.593
<i>maybe you can hire the A-Team.</i>

03:43.165 --> 03:47.919
And so, chiperoos, be very,
extra, chipmunk careful...

03:48.045 --> 03:51.923
with Safety Enemy Number 1...

03:53.300 --> 03:56.219
especially around...

03:56.303 --> 03:58.472
Mr. Tree.

03:58.930 --> 04:01.975
And who knows better
about Mr. Tree...

04:02.100 --> 04:04.686
than our bestest buddy...

04:04.853 --> 04:08.023
Ruff the Bear?

04:08.357 --> 04:10.150
Shall we visit him?

04:14.905 --> 04:17.616
Hello, Ruff!

04:20.452 --> 04:24.456
Well, it looks like Ruff
the Bear is hibernating.

04:24.831 --> 04:26.458
You know what that means?

04:26.625 --> 04:30.170
That means we're getting
close to Christmas.

04:30.420 --> 04:31.546
So...

04:31.630 --> 04:35.634
pay extra-special chipmunk
attention to these words...

04:35.717 --> 04:40.180
from our bestest friends
at World of Toys.

04:40.472 --> 04:42.682
And we're in commercial.

04:43.517 --> 04:47.396
It looks like Ruff the Bear has
been visiting his bestest buddy...

04:47.521 --> 04:49.106
Mr. Whiskey.

04:49.398 --> 04:51.066
I know we're family, Jorge...

04:51.191 --> 04:54.361
and Aunt Josie asked me to give you
a job while you're out on parole...

04:54.486 --> 04:56.610
but frankly, you're starting
to try my patience.

04:56.688 --> 05:00.075
Listen, Syd, I can't help it if it
was Mueller's coming-out party.

05:00.158 --> 05:02.160
I had to share
in his joy, you know?

05:02.244 --> 05:03.620
You know,
I have news for you, pally.

05:03.703 --> 05:06.957
You're not supposed to party
with your former cellmates.

05:07.165 --> 05:10.168
This show is called <i>Uncle Buckle-Up
Safety Program</i>...

05:10.293 --> 05:12.254
not <i>The Known Associates Show</i>.

05:12.337 --> 05:14.172
I am up to here
with the bear, Syd.

05:14.297 --> 05:17.134
Yeah, well, we stand for something
fine, something beautiful.

05:17.175 --> 05:18.593
Now get into the car.

05:19.010 --> 05:22.389
Syd, I just need a ride to my car.
I don't need a sermon.

05:23.014 --> 05:25.225
Get into the car.

05:25.851 --> 05:28.270
We want a clean kill here.
Hit-and-run...

05:28.478 --> 05:31.314
no questions asked.
- Got it.

05:36.945 --> 05:39.406
Come on, man,
they close the lot at 8:00.

05:39.865 --> 05:40.782
Buckle up.

05:40.866 --> 05:42.367
Could you maybe
cut me a break here, Syd?

05:42.492 --> 05:44.411
I got a hangover
that'd kill a bull.

05:44.619 --> 05:46.997
- Seat belt.
- Jerk!

05:57.924 --> 05:59.301
What are you, nuts?

05:59.676 --> 06:01.511
You know, after the show,
a lot of kids come out here...

06:01.595 --> 06:03.138
and I have an image to protect.

06:03.221 --> 06:07.934
I wouldn't want the chiperoos knowing that
their bestest buddy, Ruff the Bear...

06:08.059 --> 06:10.604
is a candidate
for a halfway cave.

06:12.564 --> 06:16.234
All right, that's it. That's it.
I have had it with you.

06:16.318 --> 06:17.861
I have had it with you!

06:17.986 --> 06:21.948
Come on, Syd, I need my car. I'm
taking Mueller to the strip show.

06:23.492 --> 06:25.995
That's it. That's it.

07:01.696 --> 07:03.949
Get an ambulance!
Get an ambulance!

07:10.705 --> 07:12.749
Ruff the Bear?

07:12.958 --> 07:14.376
This is gonna be it, Face.

07:14.459 --> 07:16.211
This is gonna be the part
that takes off.

07:16.294 --> 07:18.088
But, Hannibal, a bear?

07:18.213 --> 07:21.716
And on TV? TV's not for you.
You know, you're a powerhouse.

07:21.841 --> 07:25.136
You need 28 feet of canvas
to explode out of.

07:25.303 --> 07:28.431
- You'll get lost in a little screen.
- I've been thinking about that, Face.

07:28.557 --> 07:31.601
But, you know, television
is an intimate medium...

07:31.726 --> 07:34.271
and I'm an intimate
kind of a guy.

07:34.354 --> 07:36.773
Like Rambo's
an intimate kind of guy.

07:37.148 --> 07:38.733
What you have to do is...

07:38.858 --> 07:40.485
you have to get to the bear...

07:40.610 --> 07:43.238
in his undisturbed
state of mind.

07:43.363 --> 07:44.781
I see.

07:51.663 --> 07:53.832
- What do you think?
- I think you've lost your mind.

07:53.999 --> 07:56.001
And what's so important
about this job...

07:56.084 --> 07:58.295
that you schlep all of us
down to the zoo?

07:58.378 --> 08:00.338
You seem awfully uptight
about this.

08:00.422 --> 08:03.133
I mean, you know, you've lost
other jobs to other actors.

08:03.258 --> 08:05.302
They're just not writing
my kind of picture anymore.

08:05.427 --> 08:08.054
Yeah, romance and comedy,
you know. Who needs it?

08:08.079 --> 08:09.030
Yeah, but you know...

08:09.055 --> 08:12.726
that shark at Universal,
he worked for years.

08:12.809 --> 08:15.645
Yeah, but, Hannibal,
this is a kids' show.

08:15.770 --> 08:19.691
This bear sings and dances. You
know, you could look foolish.

08:19.858 --> 08:23.486
Clint Eastwood and Lee Marvin
did <i>Paint Your Wagon</i>...

08:23.570 --> 08:26.197
and they danced and they sang.
Now, did they look foolish?

08:26.323 --> 08:28.575
Indescribably so.

08:28.700 --> 08:30.118
But they went on
to bigger things.

08:30.243 --> 08:32.828
Not singing,
and definitely not dancing.

08:32.953 --> 08:35.789
Well, it was a gap
in their technique.

08:35.957 --> 08:38.501
A gap I do not intend to have.

08:38.585 --> 08:42.922
And what do you know about the technique
involved in doing a children's show?

08:43.048 --> 08:44.174
Well, that's why
I called Murdock.

08:44.341 --> 08:46.926
As soon as he gets here, we head
to the studio. Now, Face...

08:47.427 --> 08:48.511
watch.

09:10.408 --> 09:14.329
This is not working out
for me, Preston.

09:14.704 --> 09:18.708
For 15 years, we had a deal with
Tamco Toys, without a snag.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.543
Perfect toys every time.

09:20.627 --> 09:22.358
And we got letters.
You wanna see some letters?

09:22.398 --> 09:24.881
- I'll show you some letters.
- I don't wanna see no letters, Sydney.

09:25.006 --> 09:26.800
Well, and then...

09:26.966 --> 09:30.095
you switched us over to this...
- Kam Jeoung Ree.

09:30.720 --> 09:31.888
Whatever.

09:32.055 --> 09:35.350
And these bozos
send us nothing but junk.

09:35.433 --> 09:39.062
Sydney, I told you before. It is
cheaper making the dolls in Asia.

09:39.187 --> 09:40.355
I don't know about that.

09:40.438 --> 09:42.273
I've got some figures that say it's a
lot cheaper to make them over here--

09:42.399 --> 09:44.484
Honey, I want you
to stay out of this.

09:51.324 --> 09:53.785
This is junk!

09:53.952 --> 09:56.538
Look at this!
The heads come off!

09:56.705 --> 09:59.165
The heads come off,
for crying out loud.

09:59.249 --> 10:00.834
Now we really get letters.

10:00.917 --> 10:04.295
Last week, some kid
swallowed one of my eyes.

10:04.379 --> 10:08.299
Me, Uncle Buckle-Up, an international
symbol of child safety...

10:08.383 --> 10:11.845
and kids are swallowing my
eyes like they're jelly beans.

10:11.970 --> 10:13.179
Syd, watch your blood pressure.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.181
I'm going to the Safety
Commission with this.

10:15.348 --> 10:16.766
I wouldn't do that, Syd.

10:17.267 --> 10:18.685
Watch me.

10:23.189 --> 10:26.067
Hey, honey? You better
talk some sense into him.

10:26.151 --> 10:28.862
If you're looking for an ally,
you're in the wrong shop.

10:35.201 --> 10:37.662
Four, five, six, seven.

10:41.958 --> 10:45.545
A one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

10:45.628 --> 10:48.965
And a one,
two, three, four, five...

10:51.551 --> 10:55.430
This is it! This is it.

10:55.513 --> 10:57.182
This is the <i>Uncle Buckle-Up</i> set.

10:57.265 --> 11:01.102
This is the cave
where Ruff the Bear lives.

11:01.227 --> 11:04.022
I used to watch this show all
the time when I was a kid.

11:04.105 --> 11:05.565
- John Smith?
- Yes.

11:05.690 --> 11:07.400
- John Smith.
- Yes, ma'am.

11:08.004 --> 11:09.694
- Are you John Smith?
- Yes.

11:09.778 --> 11:11.488
You're late, John...

11:11.780 --> 11:13.490
but don't worry about it.

11:13.698 --> 11:15.533
You're gonna have to do better
in the future, though, huh?

11:15.658 --> 11:17.869
I'm Jackie, and
I'm the associate producer.

11:21.164 --> 11:24.959
Hannibal! Hannibal, if you want
this part, if you want this part...

11:25.084 --> 11:27.504
I can get it for you.
For the usual 10%.

11:27.670 --> 11:29.547
But you're gonna
have to really want it.

11:29.672 --> 11:32.008
You're gonna have to sing
<i>Blueberries in my Cave</i>...

11:32.091 --> 11:33.551
you're gonna have to
do the sunrise dance--

11:33.635 --> 11:36.387
<i>Blueberries in my Cave</i> ? It's a
song that encourages kids...

11:36.471 --> 11:37.847
to eat a nutritious
breakfast. It's like this.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.599
♪ There's a signal
in my tummy ♪

11:39.682 --> 11:41.226
♪ It wants something
sweet and yummy ♪

11:41.267 --> 11:43.436
♪ But I know that
it's not good for me ♪

11:43.520 --> 11:45.730
♪ So I can put blueberries
in my cave ♪

11:45.814 --> 11:47.816
♪ Breads and cereals,
they're okay ♪

11:47.899 --> 11:49.025
Like that.

11:49.859 --> 11:51.653
- You know, Murdock's right.
- Yeah?

11:51.736 --> 11:54.447
These roly-polies can play it.
I can act it.

11:54.572 --> 11:57.700
Besides,
kids' shows run forever.

11:57.784 --> 11:59.911
I ain't taking no orders
from no chipmunk.

12:00.078 --> 12:03.081
I'm not gonna be a chipmunk, B.A.
I'm gonna be a bear.

12:03.122 --> 12:04.290
Oh, yeah?

12:04.415 --> 12:06.251
- Let me see your résumé.
- I only got two.

12:06.334 --> 12:07.544
Give me one.

12:12.882 --> 12:15.552
Well, now, you can't cross out <i>The
Killgator</i>, that's one of my favorites.

12:15.635 --> 12:17.804
Not a good role model
for kids. Nope.

12:18.054 --> 12:20.682
Murdock, you can't take out
<i>The Aquamaniac</i>.

12:20.765 --> 12:22.642
I'm proud of <i>The Aquamaniac</i>.

12:25.311 --> 12:26.604
I'm sorry, Murdock.

12:28.606 --> 12:30.608
I've got to stand on my credits.

12:31.317 --> 12:33.194
Ruff the Bear...

12:33.862 --> 12:35.822
Ruff the Bear...

12:35.989 --> 12:39.409
would never, never smoke.

12:47.542 --> 12:52.088
I see here that you were the
Killgator, John, and the Aquamaniac.

12:52.213 --> 12:53.256
Yes, that's right.

12:53.339 --> 12:55.758
Those are very frightening
characters, aren't they, John?

12:56.009 --> 12:59.512
Well, I tried to play them
with an air of vulnerability.

12:59.804 --> 13:02.432
I'm sure you did. But
this is a children's show.

13:02.640 --> 13:05.518
We're a little worried that since you've
played so many frightening characters...

13:05.643 --> 13:09.230
you're not gonna be able to adjust to
the roly-poliness of Ruff the Bear.

13:09.314 --> 13:12.859
I'm sure, if I get a chance, I could
play this role with dimension.

13:12.942 --> 13:14.986
Well, that's why you're here,
to get just that chance.

13:15.111 --> 13:16.696
Can you roar for us, John?

13:16.779 --> 13:19.365
I thought I was reading
for Ruff the Bear.

13:19.532 --> 13:21.367
So roar like a bear, John-O.

13:21.492 --> 13:23.953
- But bears don't roar.
- I beg your pardon?

13:24.037 --> 13:26.623
Bears don't roar, they growl.

13:26.998 --> 13:29.042
Well, ours roars.

13:29.125 --> 13:30.960
Never underestimate children.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.212
They know a lot more
than adults think.

13:33.296 --> 13:35.632
They're very aware,
and if you talk down to them--

13:35.715 --> 13:37.383
Can I just hear a roar?

13:37.508 --> 13:41.137
- What kind of a roar?
- Just roar with your best judgment.

14:01.324 --> 14:04.202
What was that?
That wasn't much of a roar.

14:04.369 --> 14:06.746
It sounded more like the Cowardly
Lion from <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>.

14:06.871 --> 14:09.457
That's it, Bert Lahr.
It's my favorite roar.

14:09.624 --> 14:11.584
Okay, next.

14:11.668 --> 14:13.211
You'll be hearing from us, John.

14:13.294 --> 14:16.047
Well, if I could just read
for the part.

14:16.130 --> 14:19.050
- You'll be hearing from us, John.
- I've done a lot of research.

14:19.133 --> 14:21.594
Well, I've
really been thinking "bear."

14:21.719 --> 14:23.721
Okay, okay, okay.

14:25.139 --> 14:27.600
Show us how you drink water
with your paw.

14:27.684 --> 14:31.104
Well, bears don't drink
with their paws.

14:31.229 --> 14:32.313
Next.

14:34.440 --> 14:36.526
He comes out the stage door
right over there.

14:36.609 --> 14:39.070
This time we'll use
the heavy artillery.

14:46.244 --> 14:48.287
Syd, what's wrong?

14:49.497 --> 14:50.999
I'll be all right, kid.

14:51.250 --> 14:53.297
Maybe we should cancel
your appearance tonight, huh?

14:53.322 --> 14:54.625
No, I've gotta be there.

14:55.545 --> 14:57.797
All right. Well, if you change
your mind, let me know.

15:00.633 --> 15:02.552
One, two, three, four.

15:02.927 --> 15:05.638
And a one, two, three, four...

15:09.976 --> 15:11.477
Hannibal, how'd it go?

15:11.686 --> 15:13.187
Well, I...

15:13.438 --> 15:14.772
This is it, guys.

15:14.981 --> 15:17.984
An actor can tell when his
career's coming to an end.

15:18.818 --> 15:22.071
You can only play the Aquamaniac
a certain number of times...

15:22.280 --> 15:24.991
before you've explored every
aspect of his character.

15:26.034 --> 15:27.118
That...

15:27.577 --> 15:30.705
was my chance
at television immortality.

15:30.830 --> 15:33.666
Yeah, but, Hannibal,
it was just a bear.

15:34.083 --> 15:35.877
They weren't looking
for the definitive Hamlet.

15:36.002 --> 15:39.130
They just wanted a guy who wouldn't
sweat too much in a fur coat.

15:39.213 --> 15:39.964
Right?

15:40.048 --> 15:41.090
You want this part?

15:41.674 --> 15:42.925
You want this part?

15:43.509 --> 15:44.844
You got this part.

15:57.065 --> 15:59.192
Stay away
from the toy convention.

16:02.028 --> 16:05.782
Now listen, you two-bit,
washed-up, no-talent bum...

16:05.948 --> 16:09.077
a dead actor gets no residuals.
You hear what I'm saying?

16:12.872 --> 16:14.749
Hold it right there, pal.

16:27.386 --> 16:29.180
They're snatching
Uncle Buckle-Up!

17:57.727 --> 17:59.604
Come on.
Sydney, are you all right?

18:05.151 --> 18:06.903
Whoever you are, I owe you one.

18:06.986 --> 18:09.572
Sydney, I'm H.M. Murdock...

18:10.031 --> 18:12.116
and this is my client...

18:12.408 --> 18:14.619
John "Hannibal" Smith.

18:15.995 --> 18:17.496
You're the Aquagator.

18:18.080 --> 18:19.498
You want the job, you got it.

18:19.624 --> 18:23.628
I mean, Jorge may have rhythm,
but you are Ruff the Bear.

18:34.430 --> 18:36.891
I've always been interested
in child safety.

18:37.558 --> 18:40.478
Then about three months ago,
Herman Price...

18:40.561 --> 18:43.940
the man who's been handling my
merchandising for the past 25 years...

18:44.023 --> 18:45.066
retired.

18:45.149 --> 18:47.902
- You been a chipmunk for 25 years?
- Longer.

18:48.027 --> 18:50.404
He's had his own show
since 1956.

18:50.488 --> 18:53.574
'Cause I know, when I was a kid, I
always wanted to be a Helpful Hamster.

18:53.741 --> 18:56.786
Well, all I can say is, after the
way you jumped on those guys...

18:56.869 --> 18:58.649
you're the most helpful
hamster in the world.

18:58.674 --> 18:59.764
Any time, Syd.

18:59.789 --> 19:02.333
So you think the trouble's coming
from inside your own company?

19:02.667 --> 19:04.669
Maybe.
After Herman left...

19:04.835 --> 19:09.131
the syndication people wanted to bring
somebody in from outside the company.

19:09.423 --> 19:10.925
A real fire-eater.

19:11.008 --> 19:12.593
That's when
they brought in Preston.

19:13.010 --> 19:14.845
And he brought
his own people with him.

19:15.554 --> 19:19.850
And then the creep goes ahead and
breaks the contract with Tamco Toys...

19:20.309 --> 19:24.397
and jobs the dolls to some company
in Asia nobody ever heard about.

19:24.522 --> 19:26.857
And they start sending us junk.

19:26.941 --> 19:29.151
But the price goes up.

19:29.735 --> 19:31.737
And the quality goes down.

19:31.946 --> 19:33.906
Suddenly, I find myself
selling the very thing...

19:34.031 --> 19:35.449
I've been fighting
my whole life against.

19:35.491 --> 19:38.077
Anyway, this Preston fellow
must be tied into it somehow.

19:38.202 --> 19:40.121
All this is over some dolls?

19:40.371 --> 19:41.664
Yeah, B.A.'s right.

19:41.789 --> 19:45.918
Why would somebody resort to
kidnapping over a few stuffed animals?

19:46.252 --> 19:49.088
- They almost killed my nephew.
- Your nephew?

19:49.213 --> 19:50.881
Your predecessor, Ruff.

19:51.257 --> 19:52.883
You know, at first
I thought it was an accident.

19:53.050 --> 19:55.136
Now I see it was a warning.

19:56.262 --> 19:58.264
I'm afraid somebody's
gonna get killed.

19:59.974 --> 20:01.851
What can you do
with people like this?

20:02.018 --> 20:03.352
You find their toy box...

20:03.477 --> 20:05.563
and then you pull all the
wheels off their little trucks.

20:07.481 --> 20:09.400
Oh, yeah.

20:15.698 --> 20:18.576
I send you out
to whack a chipmunk...

20:18.659 --> 20:20.745
and you come back
with a mouthful of excuses.

20:20.828 --> 20:22.997
Look, Nick, the guy had guards.

20:23.164 --> 20:25.708
Do you know
what you made happen to me?

20:26.667 --> 20:29.128
I was sitting at a luncheon at
a businessman's association...

20:29.253 --> 20:31.172
getting a plaque for my...

20:34.300 --> 20:38.888
"For my many contributions to the
welfare of the children of Encino."

20:39.055 --> 20:41.891
And this maitre d' comes up to
me and taps me on my shoulder...

20:42.099 --> 20:44.268
and says there's a gentleman
here to see me.

20:44.435 --> 20:46.854
I look up
and I see this clown...

20:46.937 --> 20:49.023
in a yellow and green
plaid sports jacket...

20:49.106 --> 20:52.068
and I say to the maître d',
"That's impossible, sir.

20:52.193 --> 20:54.653
"I have no business here
with this man."

20:55.404 --> 20:57.031
And the maître d' says...

20:59.116 --> 21:00.451
real loud...

21:01.660 --> 21:03.537
like he's rooting
for the Dodgers...

21:03.829 --> 21:08.376
"He claims to, sir. Says
he's a bail bondsman, sir."

21:08.501 --> 21:10.920
Nicky, I can't operate
if my people are in jail.

21:11.003 --> 21:12.254
It's like I'm in
a monster movie.

21:12.338 --> 21:14.256
Nick, if I tried to make bail,
I would've blown my cover.

21:14.298 --> 21:15.758
I turn into a punk.

21:16.133 --> 21:18.177
And all these manicureds
are staring at me.

21:19.470 --> 21:22.223
And suddenly I'm wearing a
double-breasted pinstripe suit...

21:22.306 --> 21:25.935
and I'm a punk holding onto a cheap piece
of wood with some tin nailed to it.

21:28.562 --> 21:31.065
- You think that's funny?
- I'll take care of it, Nick.

21:31.190 --> 21:32.983
That's what you said yesterday.

21:33.526 --> 21:35.528
We've got millions of dollars
riding on this thing.

21:35.611 --> 21:37.613
Hey, Nick, I know exactly
what we got on this thing.

21:37.696 --> 21:40.199
Then when the hell are you gonna get
a hold of that punk again, huh?

21:40.282 --> 21:42.076
When are you gonna get
a hold of him?

21:42.451 --> 21:44.995
That crumb's probably hiding
somewhere in some hole somewhere.

21:45.121 --> 21:48.457
No, Nick, not our Syd. No, he
called that PR broad, that Kelly.

21:48.541 --> 21:51.043
He said he's gonna make that
appearance at the toy convention.

21:51.168 --> 21:54.088
Oh, that's just great.

21:55.714 --> 21:58.134
Our shill's gonna be at a toy
convention, in the middle of a floor...

21:58.259 --> 21:59.343
standing in front
of our booth...

21:59.468 --> 22:02.012
yapping at the top of his lungs
to the ever-loving mommies...

22:02.179 --> 22:04.265
how much garbage our toys are.

22:04.431 --> 22:05.933
That'll never happen, Nick.

22:06.016 --> 22:08.352
- You seem pretty sure about that.
- I am.

22:10.146 --> 22:11.689
Yeah, well, I hope so...

22:12.481 --> 22:15.609
'cause your life
depends upon it.

22:18.112 --> 22:19.613
Get out of here.

22:26.579 --> 22:28.747
Well, everything
seems to be quiet here.

22:28.873 --> 22:30.541
Man, I can't believe all this.

22:30.666 --> 22:33.002
I'm telling you,
kids' stuff is big business.

22:33.127 --> 22:34.712
If Hannibal takes this job...

22:34.879 --> 22:38.257
you looking at $25,000 just
for a personal appearance.

22:38.340 --> 22:39.800
$25,000?

22:39.967 --> 22:42.553
That's right. Just
for opening a supermarket.

22:42.678 --> 22:44.346
You know, Hannibal
might look pretty good...

22:44.471 --> 22:46.557
in that Ruff the Bear costume,
don't you think?

22:48.309 --> 22:50.853
Listen, Syd,
it's better if I do it.

22:50.978 --> 22:53.147
We don't know who's out there,
or what they're gonna do.

22:53.272 --> 22:55.983
You look at him. He hasn't even played
the bear yet and now he wants my part.

22:56.100 --> 22:58.436
Syd, I don't like this. I think
that we should call the police.

22:58.469 --> 22:59.729
And what do we tell them?

22:59.754 --> 23:01.888
There's been a kidnapping
and attempted murder.

23:02.031 --> 23:04.158
Oh, they're a lot of help.
They're a lot of help.

23:04.283 --> 23:05.701
You know, they arrested
the kidnappers...

23:05.743 --> 23:07.620
in an hour
they let them out on bail.

23:08.537 --> 23:10.247
Would you talk
to this man, please?

23:10.623 --> 23:12.499
You'll be a
target out there, Syd.

23:12.625 --> 23:13.876
It's better if I do it.

23:13.959 --> 23:15.961
I've been a target
all my life. It's my hobby.

23:16.045 --> 23:18.130
Your friends can
take care of us.

23:18.214 --> 23:21.133
Besides, if you go out there, the
kids will know the difference.

23:21.425 --> 23:23.427
You know, it's not
just that I'm a clown.

23:23.594 --> 23:25.221
There's only one me.

23:25.346 --> 23:26.889
Syd, you've got a phone call.

23:26.972 --> 23:29.099
- Now?
- He said it was important.

23:35.397 --> 23:38.275
- What do you do with a man like that?
- Keep him off the stage.

23:38.567 --> 23:39.526
How?

23:39.693 --> 23:41.528
For a man who makes his
living playing a chipmunk...

23:41.612 --> 23:43.781
he's about as pigheaded
as they come.

23:44.073 --> 23:45.532
It's all quiet
out there, Hannibal.

23:45.616 --> 23:47.826
- And we're all set in the theater.
- Good.

23:48.035 --> 23:49.161
We'll go with the plan.

23:49.245 --> 23:51.038
You guys answer me one question.

23:52.456 --> 23:53.290
Who are you?

23:53.374 --> 23:56.752
Oh, well, I'd be glad
to explain it to you.

23:57.086 --> 23:58.504
So explain.

23:58.587 --> 24:00.422
Oh, no, I didn't mean here.

24:00.714 --> 24:04.551
What I had in mind
was someplace quiet.

24:04.760 --> 24:09.598
A quiet filled with the gentle
strains of gypsy violins.

24:09.890 --> 24:12.726
A quiet where the soft bubble
of champagne...

24:12.810 --> 24:16.981
mixes mystically
with the sizzle of moussaka.

24:17.189 --> 24:20.484
Yes, a place where the sound of
two hearts beating as one...

24:20.609 --> 24:23.320
drowns out the murmur of lovers.

24:24.196 --> 24:26.907
Something tells me
we'd never get to the answer.

24:33.080 --> 24:34.456
What was it?

24:40.546 --> 24:42.923
They just told me
if I went on, they'd kill me.

24:46.093 --> 24:49.013
<i>And now, without further ado...</i>

24:49.096 --> 24:53.642
<i>it's my great pleasure to
introduce a friend to us all...</i>

24:53.726 --> 24:57.521
Uncle Buckle-Up
<i>and his woodland chums</i>.

24:57.646 --> 24:59.189
<i>Hello, chiperoos...</i>

24:59.315 --> 25:02.609
Let's do it. I'm gonna waste
that chipmunk once and for all.

25:04.945 --> 25:06.864
<i>First thing,
we are going to meet...</i>

25:06.947 --> 25:11.118
<i>all of our little friends, the ones we
have learned to love and live with...</i>

25:31.221 --> 25:34.641
It's those guys again!
Let's get out of here!

26:26.777 --> 26:28.320
Let's chat.

26:36.036 --> 26:37.663
You blew it again?

26:41.291 --> 26:44.294
And this time you lost a man?

26:44.420 --> 26:46.797
Nicky, they got this guy guarded like
he was a president or something.

26:46.922 --> 26:47.923
Nicky, it's spooky.

26:48.006 --> 26:49.925
All of a sudden they got machine
guns, they're blowing us apart.

26:50.008 --> 26:51.760
Nick, I was lucky to get out
of there with my life.

26:51.919 --> 26:53.379
That remains to be seen.

26:53.512 --> 26:55.536
All right, Nick, I can still handle this.
I got an idea.

26:55.561 --> 26:56.904
You got an idea, huh?

26:57.182 --> 26:58.517
You can't handle a chipmunk...

26:58.600 --> 27:00.811
and you tell me you got an idea?

27:02.563 --> 27:03.730
I got an idea, too.

27:03.755 --> 27:05.274
- Oh, good, Nick.
- Yeah.

27:05.524 --> 27:08.068
I'm gonna throw you
right through this window, you see?

27:08.235 --> 27:11.780
And before you hit this pavement, you
could tell me what your idea is.

27:11.864 --> 27:14.575
Nick, you know we can't get
to this guy directly, right?

27:14.658 --> 27:15.826
You already proved that.

27:15.909 --> 27:17.619
I'm looking for some
side door, you know?

27:17.703 --> 27:20.622
So, like, we can get something
on this guy, right?

27:20.789 --> 27:23.459
Guess what I found, Nick?
A daughter.

27:24.835 --> 27:26.211
Wait till you see this, Nick.

27:26.670 --> 27:29.256
Look here, Nick.
This is a tax form.

27:29.548 --> 27:31.133
Nick, do you want my glasses?

27:31.467 --> 27:33.635
It says this guy has a daughter.

27:34.470 --> 27:38.682
Okay? So I say,
get the girl, we got the man.

27:41.393 --> 27:42.603
Maybe.

27:43.020 --> 27:45.689
- It'll work, Nick.
- You better not mess this one up.

27:45.981 --> 27:47.399
It's done, Nick.
It's done.

27:47.566 --> 27:49.067
And what about this guy
you left behind?

27:49.151 --> 27:52.362
Cobb? He's a good soldier, Nick. He
knows just when to keep his mouth shut.

27:52.529 --> 27:55.991
His name is Gretsch.
G-R-E-T-S-C-H.

27:59.369 --> 28:01.288
Help me. Come on, please.

28:02.080 --> 28:03.665
Pull me up, please.

28:05.959 --> 28:07.920
Oh, come on, please, please.

28:09.922 --> 28:12.257
Come on, please, please, please.

28:12.508 --> 28:15.344
It'll be interesting
to see who gets tired first...

28:15.469 --> 28:17.095
B.A. or the lion.

28:17.429 --> 28:20.057
That's all I know.
I promise.

28:20.140 --> 28:21.642
Try not to sweat too much.

28:21.767 --> 28:24.102
Lions tend to look on it
as au jus.

28:24.186 --> 28:26.688
I swear
I'm telling you the truth.

28:26.813 --> 28:29.816
Actually, you're pretty lucky.
These are African lions.

28:29.983 --> 28:32.027
The Asiatics are the jumpers.

28:32.194 --> 28:33.362
Please.

28:33.487 --> 28:35.906
They're not man-eaters.
Only when they're hungry.

28:36.740 --> 28:38.825
They do look
kind of underfed, don't they?

28:39.368 --> 28:41.578
Where would we find
Mr. Gretsch?

28:41.745 --> 28:45.249
Fun 4 All Amusements. 2750
Marshall Boulevard, Santa Monica.

28:45.374 --> 28:47.834
<i>He's there now. Go see him.
He's the one you want.</i>

28:48.835 --> 28:50.462
Kelly, take
Syd back to the studio...

28:50.546 --> 28:52.297
and set up a press conference
for tonight.

28:52.381 --> 28:54.883
- We'll go look up Mr. Gretsch.
- I'm going with you.

28:55.342 --> 28:56.593
You'd be safer at the studio.

28:56.760 --> 28:58.095
Look, this man
has fouled my nest.

28:58.178 --> 28:59.846
I wanna look in his eye
when I tell him so.

28:59.930 --> 29:02.641
- Be reasonable, Syd.
- Face, you take her.

29:02.766 --> 29:04.351
It'll be my pleasure.

29:04.476 --> 29:07.062
And check Preston's office.
See what you can dig up.

29:07.087 --> 29:07.860
All right.

29:07.885 --> 29:10.243
If he comes in, bag him
and call us in the van.

29:13.026 --> 29:14.319
Syd, shall we?

29:14.403 --> 29:17.155
<i>Wait, where are you going?
I told you, come back here.</i>

29:35.132 --> 29:36.842
We're here to see Mr. Gretsch.

29:49.646 --> 29:52.232
Wouldn't he make a great doll?

29:52.983 --> 29:54.484
I don't like it.

29:55.861 --> 29:59.156
Their heads are not supposed to come
off until we want them to come off.

29:59.323 --> 30:01.241
Mr. Preston said this is the
only way he could do it.

30:01.491 --> 30:04.286
The first shipment is at the warehouse now.
We'll see how it worked.

30:05.329 --> 30:08.457
If you mess this up, we'll see
how easy your head comes off.

30:08.540 --> 30:09.833
Hi, guys.

30:15.714 --> 30:17.674
Nice toys
they've got around here.

30:17.966 --> 30:19.301
Would you look at this?

30:22.721 --> 30:24.556
Well, it looks like
it's made to come off.

30:24.681 --> 30:26.308
- But why?
- I don't know.

30:26.391 --> 30:29.227
But I'll bet he's got a warehouse full
of them. Maybe we should take a peek.

30:29.353 --> 30:31.938
- You ain't too smart, mister.
- Maybe not.

30:32.064 --> 30:34.816
But I'm a real expert at telling
other people what to do.

30:35.651 --> 30:37.069
Now, here are your orders.

30:37.194 --> 30:38.654
You're going to take us
to the warehouse...

30:38.779 --> 30:41.990
and then you're gonna get out of
the Uncle Buckle-Up business.

30:42.115 --> 30:43.325
Now let's go.

30:53.960 --> 30:56.046
How many Buckle-Up
dolls did you sell last year?

30:56.171 --> 30:57.631
About 100,000.

30:57.798 --> 31:00.133
Hey, that's interesting.
According to this audit...

31:00.300 --> 31:04.012
this year Preston's imported
nearly 200,000 dolls.

31:04.471 --> 31:06.515
Have the ratings of the show
been going up?

31:06.765 --> 31:09.685
No. As a matter of fact, the show's
been slipping this last season.

31:09.851 --> 31:13.313
Well, why would he import twice as
many dolls as he could possibly sell?

31:13.563 --> 31:14.606
I don't know.

31:14.773 --> 31:17.109
Well, we'll just have to
ask Preston, won't we?

31:17.609 --> 31:19.820
Hey, you better go back to the office
and set up the press conference.

31:19.903 --> 31:22.030
Okay. A couple of calls
should do that.

31:22.155 --> 31:25.701
Great. And meet me down on the stage.
We'll wait for Preston there.

31:27.327 --> 31:28.578
Yeah.

32:15.500 --> 32:18.420
We're just about set. I just have to call
them back in five minutes to confirm.

32:18.503 --> 32:21.715
Terrific. We can wrap this whole
thing up before tomorrow's show.

32:21.840 --> 32:25.135
You know, I really do appreciate
everything that you're doing for Sydney.

32:25.302 --> 32:29.181
Well, what would the world be
without Uncle Buckle-Up?

32:29.389 --> 32:31.016
You mean you're a fan, too?

32:31.141 --> 32:35.228
Me? The biggest. I've been
watching the show for years.

32:35.353 --> 32:40.066
Yeah, all the way back to
when Rob Parker played Ruff.

32:41.318 --> 32:44.362
What happened
to the Truthful Turtle here?

32:45.739 --> 32:47.574
- Who?
- The Truthful Turtle.

32:47.699 --> 32:48.992
Truthful? He sits right
here in front of the log.

32:49.075 --> 32:50.243
People keep stepping on him.

32:50.368 --> 32:51.953
I don't know. It...

32:54.068 --> 32:56.416
- Just...
- You know...

32:57.959 --> 33:02.714
the Truthful Turtle can always tell
when a chiperoo is exaggerating.

33:03.173 --> 33:06.927
You're right. I don't really
watch the show.

33:07.052 --> 33:09.179
I'd be a little concerned
about you if you did.

33:09.638 --> 33:11.348
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

33:12.349 --> 33:16.978
You know, you don't have to
play the Good Manners Mole...

33:17.437 --> 33:18.980
to make friends with me.

33:31.117 --> 33:34.663
I had better go
call the agency back.

33:39.751 --> 33:41.962
Okay, hot rod, the party's over.

34:24.629 --> 34:28.675
Okay, pal, we're gonna
go talk to Uncle Buckle-Up.

34:33.513 --> 34:37.141
Well, Sydney is no longer your
shill, so you can forget it.

34:37.266 --> 34:38.768
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

34:38.893 --> 34:40.228
Well, let's see
what he's got to say...

34:40.312 --> 34:42.688
when we got his daughter
hanging out the window.

34:44.065 --> 34:46.650
Uncle Buckle-Up's daughter?

34:51.031 --> 34:52.197
Hold it.

34:55.827 --> 34:57.621
That's it. That's the junk.

35:07.172 --> 35:09.925
Yeah, this is, like, a new model.
I don't have one of these yet.

35:10.675 --> 35:13.678
Colonel, I think you'd better
take a look at this stuff.

35:19.643 --> 35:20.894
Heroin.

35:21.645 --> 35:23.229
I think I'm gonna be sick.

35:23.355 --> 35:24.856
We've got the girl, Nick.

35:26.358 --> 35:27.609
Hi, guys.

35:30.695 --> 35:32.280
I'm sorry, Dad.

35:32.781 --> 35:34.032
Dad?

35:34.824 --> 35:37.535
Give us your guns
unless you want the girl hurt.

35:38.828 --> 35:40.455
All right, over there.

35:41.539 --> 35:43.208
After you.

35:47.170 --> 35:48.463
No, not you.

35:49.506 --> 35:51.007
We got a little business.

35:56.554 --> 35:59.099
You keep them here while I
dicker with the chipmunk.

35:59.224 --> 36:00.433
Right, Nick.

36:10.318 --> 36:12.570
You were messing around
with Uncle Buckle-Up's daughter?

36:12.737 --> 36:14.239
You animal!

36:21.663 --> 36:23.610
All right, let's think
about getting out of here.

36:23.942 --> 36:27.085
Now, go through everything until
you find something we can use.

36:36.302 --> 36:38.596
From now on, you're gonna
play ball in my court.

36:38.805 --> 36:39.973
And the first thing
you're gonna do...

36:40.015 --> 36:41.891
is you're gonna cancel that
press conference of yours.

36:41.975 --> 36:44.185
- Forget it.
- I'm not fooling around with you, Sydney.

36:44.310 --> 36:46.062
I've got your daughter
and I've got your friends...

36:46.187 --> 36:49.107
and if you don't play ball with me,
I'm gonna feed them to the dogs.

36:49.274 --> 36:52.819
Now, the first think I want you to
do is to endorse my dolls from Asia.

36:53.737 --> 36:55.113
What's so funny, Sydney?

36:55.280 --> 36:58.408
You can't hurt me.
You can't hurt my people.

36:58.867 --> 37:01.036
Without me, you got nothing.

37:01.202 --> 37:03.621
Don't be stupid, old man.

37:04.456 --> 37:07.125
There's a world
full of animals out there.

37:07.417 --> 37:09.502
I'll get myself
a rabbit or something.

37:09.669 --> 37:11.588
You ain't indispensable.

37:18.219 --> 37:19.512
You got them locked up?

37:19.679 --> 37:21.431
It's all taken care of, Nick.

37:22.307 --> 37:23.600
Good.

37:32.650 --> 37:34.402
I want this mess
cleaned up today.

37:34.486 --> 37:36.571
Then I'm gonna take this chipmunk
here down to the studio...

37:36.696 --> 37:38.448
where he's gonna make the most
heartwarming endorsement...

37:38.531 --> 37:40.200
the American public
has ever heard.

37:40.784 --> 37:43.995
And then I want you to go to the factory
and I want you to take care of business.

37:44.245 --> 37:45.455
Consider it done, Nick.

37:45.538 --> 37:49.793
I'll be dropping by with the old man
right after he makes the commercial.

37:50.960 --> 37:52.629
Then we'll take care
of all of them.

37:53.213 --> 37:54.756
All of them, including...

37:54.839 --> 37:56.466
Chipmunks are a dime a dozen.

37:56.591 --> 37:58.700
We'll get ourselves a new
shill after the accident.

37:58.725 --> 37:59.748
Accident?

37:59.787 --> 38:01.284
They're all gonna be
at the factory, right?

38:01.309 --> 38:02.049
Yeah.

38:02.074 --> 38:04.849
- We got fire insurance, right?
- Right.

38:05.517 --> 38:07.268
Then make me a tragedy.

38:24.119 --> 38:25.328
How does it look, B.A.?

38:25.411 --> 38:27.122
It's solid as a rock.

38:27.622 --> 38:28.915
Colonel?

38:33.044 --> 38:34.379
Look at this.

38:36.381 --> 38:37.799
And this.

41:25.633 --> 41:27.510
Hey, Hannibal, you smell that?

41:27.719 --> 41:29.053
Gasoline.

42:00.877 --> 42:02.795
Stand by, everybody.

42:03.171 --> 42:04.589
Here we go.

42:12.263 --> 42:13.890
Where did they get the dynamite?

43:20.998 --> 43:23.167
- Is that them?
- Yeah.

43:23.376 --> 43:25.795
- Then it's over?
- Not quite.

43:27.880 --> 43:31.217
And that's why I think
these Uncle Buckle-Up dolls...

43:31.300 --> 43:34.095
are the best
Uncle Buckle-Up dolls yet.

43:35.596 --> 43:36.931
Hi, slime.

43:46.315 --> 43:47.608
Jorge?

43:50.570 --> 43:53.156
Actually, I kind of wanted
to do that to him myself.

43:53.406 --> 43:54.782
I understand that, Colonel...

43:54.866 --> 43:57.451
'cause that's what a Good
Manners Mole would have done.

44:25.897 --> 44:28.191
Hannibal, that was wonderful.
You, too, Syd.

44:28.316 --> 44:30.318
Gee, thanks, Murdock.

44:31.277 --> 44:34.864
Oh, come on, guys. I'm dancing
my heart out, out there.

44:35.656 --> 44:39.202
Hey, give me my bear costume.
What are you guys doing here?

44:40.953 --> 44:42.288
Excuse me.

44:49.128 --> 44:51.422
Ruff the Bear doesn't drink.

44:51.505 --> 44:53.925
What are you, nuts?
Sydney!

44:54.508 --> 44:56.260
You wanna tell me
what's going on?

44:57.553 --> 44:59.138
It's not that I don't
appreciate what you've done...

44:59.222 --> 45:02.683
but in this business,
it's not courage that counts.

45:03.267 --> 45:05.186
It's nepotism that's important.

45:05.311 --> 45:07.521
Thank you, Sydney.
That's right.

45:08.147 --> 45:09.941
If you'll excuse me...

45:10.274 --> 45:12.610
I must rehearse.

45:13.694 --> 45:15.029
Pardon me.

45:22.995 --> 45:26.290
You're going to AA, Jorge.

45:27.083 --> 45:28.417
Not a bad rhyme, huh?

45:28.542 --> 45:29.886
<i>Ten seconds to air.</i>

45:29.911 --> 45:31.837
Listen, so long
as you're here...

45:31.963 --> 45:33.798
what do you say
to one performance?

45:33.923 --> 45:35.174
Are you kidding?

45:36.342 --> 45:37.843
This is it, guys.

45:38.594 --> 45:40.346
This is like 42nd Street.

45:40.846 --> 45:42.932
I'm going out there
like a kid...

45:43.057 --> 45:45.810
and I'm coming back a star!
