00:16.454 --> 00:19.334
It seems a bit snug, Mrs McCarthy.

00:19.334 --> 00:21.574
There. That wasn't so difficult now,
was it?

00:23.214 --> 00:25.614
I just wanted to wish you
all the best.

00:25.614 --> 00:27.334
And I will be praying for you.

00:27.334 --> 00:28.894
Thank you, Father.

00:28.894 --> 00:30.374
We'll need it.

00:30.374 --> 00:31.494
Ah, Kembleford!

00:31.494 --> 00:34.774
I have to say, how brave of you
all to come back after last year.

00:34.774 --> 00:35.774
Well done, you!

00:37.214 --> 00:40.534
We got the lowest marks
in the history of the competition.

00:40.534 --> 00:43.694
We've been working very hard
since then, I can assure you.

00:43.694 --> 00:45.934
As have the Hambleston Harmonisers.

00:45.934 --> 00:49.574
We might be reigning champions,
but one can't rest on one's laurels.

00:49.574 --> 00:51.534
Break a leg.

00:54.094 --> 00:57.934
Well, I think
you are going to be marvellous.

THEY APPLAUD

02:46.814 --> 02:49.054
The moment of truth.

02:49.054 --> 02:52.094
Which three of our
Gloucestershire entrants

02:52.094 --> 02:54.854
will be progressing to
the Grand Final

02:54.854 --> 02:57.974
of the Three Counties Choir
Competition,

02:57.974 --> 03:02.214
to be held here, in
Worcester Cathedral, next weekend?

03:03.454 --> 03:06.934
Whatever happens,
you have done Kembleford proud.

03:06.934 --> 03:07.934
Hear, hear.

03:09.734 --> 03:11.974
The three Gloucestershire
finalists are...

03:15.654 --> 03:17.054
..Shepherd Magna.

03:23.534 --> 03:27.094
Last year's champions,
the Hambleston Harmonisers.

03:33.134 --> 03:35.734
And last but not least...

04:17.613 --> 04:21.254
I still can't believe you came back
all this way just for the final.

04:21.254 --> 04:24.294
Mrs M would never have forgiven me
if I'd missed it.

04:24.294 --> 04:26.334
I've never seen her in such a tizz.

04:26.334 --> 04:28.014
You are a good friend.

04:28.014 --> 04:30.894
And fortunately, Monty had
some business in London

04:30.894 --> 04:33.054
and the timing was perfect.

04:33.054 --> 04:36.614
Now, not so bad, if I say so myself.

04:36.614 --> 04:37.934
Indeed.

04:37.934 --> 04:41.174
And I'm not the greatest
admirer of the humble omnibus.

04:41.174 --> 04:43.814
In fact,
perhaps we should take your car.

04:43.814 --> 04:47.934
Oh, you know perfectly well that Mrs
M wants us to all travel together.

04:47.934 --> 04:51.494
She's terrified that something bad
will happen if she lets us

04:51.494 --> 04:53.014
out of her sight.

04:53.014 --> 04:54.854
I'm sure you're right.

04:54.854 --> 04:58.614
And, for her sake,
I shall rough it just this once.

04:58.614 --> 04:59.654
THEY LAUGH

04:59.654 --> 05:01.694
Ah! There you are!

05:01.694 --> 05:04.134
You excited about your big day?

05:04.134 --> 05:05.934
Exasperated, more like.

05:07.574 --> 05:09.814
Harriet Whitley has dropped out.

05:09.814 --> 05:11.654
Dropped out? Why?

05:11.654 --> 05:14.374
She claims to have picked up
a stomach bug

05:14.374 --> 05:16.294
and says she can't get out of bed.

05:16.294 --> 05:19.934
The rules state clearly that each
choir must have six members.

05:19.934 --> 05:21.254
Three men and three women.

05:21.254 --> 05:22.414
What will you do?

05:23.894 --> 05:25.254
Well, don't look at me.

05:25.254 --> 05:26.854
My music teacher once paid me

05:26.854 --> 05:29.094
to bunk off on the day
of the school concert.

05:29.094 --> 05:32.574
She said that my soprano could be
used as an offensive weapon.

05:34.214 --> 05:35.294
No!

05:37.374 --> 05:38.334
SHE TUTS

05:48.534 --> 05:50.294
KNOCK ON DOOR

05:50.294 --> 05:52.734
Right, then, sir, I'm going.

05:52.734 --> 05:55.854
Going?
Yes, sir, my afternoon off.

05:55.854 --> 05:56.974
Afternoon off?!

05:56.974 --> 05:58.974
For the choir competition, sir.

05:58.974 --> 06:00.334
I did tell you...

06:00.334 --> 06:01.774
..on several occasions.

06:01.774 --> 06:02.774
What time is it?

06:04.454 --> 06:06.254
Just gone quarter to 12, sir.

06:09.934 --> 06:11.534
Is there a problem, sir?

06:12.974 --> 06:16.654
My daughter's performing in the
competition with her youth choir.

06:16.654 --> 06:18.654
How exciting for her.

06:18.654 --> 06:19.894
Isn't it just?

06:19.894 --> 06:22.294
That's why I promised the wife,
under pain of death,

06:22.294 --> 06:24.254
that I'd be back in time
to go with them.

06:24.254 --> 06:27.014
Only it slipped my mind,
what with all these burglaries.

06:27.014 --> 06:30.494
I'm sure she'll understand, sir.
You know, duty calls, and all that.

06:30.494 --> 06:32.294
Understand?

06:32.294 --> 06:34.494
I'll be in the doghouse so long,

06:34.494 --> 06:37.854
I'll have to get the postman to
start delivering my mail there!

06:37.854 --> 06:39.774
Well, you could come with us
on the bus, sir.

06:39.774 --> 06:42.014
There's bound to be a spare seat.

06:42.934 --> 06:44.734
Are you sure there's room?

06:44.734 --> 06:46.774
The more, the merrier, sir,
you know?

06:46.774 --> 06:49.734
You might have to put up with us
practising some of our songs,

06:49.734 --> 06:51.414
but, well...

06:51.414 --> 06:53.014
That's all right, Goodfellow.

06:53.014 --> 06:56.054
I knew I wouldn't escape
punishment entirely.

07:00.694 --> 07:02.934
No doubt they will be here soon.

07:03.934 --> 07:05.494
When I was choir leader,

07:05.494 --> 07:08.934
I'd instruct everyone to be
here at least ten minutes early.

07:08.934 --> 07:13.174
Well, I'm choir leader now,
and I'm sure they are on their way.

07:13.174 --> 07:14.734
Now, there they are.

07:14.734 --> 07:16.214
My apologies, Mrs McCarthy.

07:18.374 --> 07:20.534
Where have you been?
Sorry, Mother.

07:20.534 --> 07:23.054
My fault. I wanted to show Nicholas
some hotel brochures

07:23.054 --> 07:24.254
for the honeymoon.

07:24.254 --> 07:26.734
Waste of money, in my opinion.

07:26.734 --> 07:29.614
My Henry and I made do with
a slap-up meal at the Red Lion.

07:29.614 --> 07:31.494
He was back at the factory
next morning.

07:31.494 --> 07:34.014
Yes, well, Audrey deserves the best.

07:35.334 --> 07:37.534
Setting up home together
isn't cheap, you know.

07:37.534 --> 07:41.014
But, as you're friends,
I'll give you a special

07:41.014 --> 07:43.854
discount on our bumper
pack of cleaning products.

07:43.854 --> 07:47.014
It has everything you
need for a sparkling home.

07:47.014 --> 07:49.374
Well, we'll definitely
think about it, Wesley.

07:49.374 --> 07:50.934
Promise.

07:50.934 --> 07:52.854
I already have everything we need.

07:52.854 --> 07:56.374
And the soap he sold me last week
left stains all over my basin.

07:56.374 --> 07:58.414
No, that can't be right.

07:58.414 --> 08:00.854
My products are top-of-the-range.

08:00.854 --> 08:02.654
Afternoon. I hope you don't mind.

08:02.654 --> 08:04.134
I offered the Inspector a lift.

08:05.454 --> 08:07.334
Why ever would I mind?

08:07.334 --> 08:08.614
Hello, everyone.

08:10.174 --> 08:11.694
Mr Summerton.

08:11.694 --> 08:13.334
Inspector.

08:13.334 --> 08:14.454
Good to see you again.

08:17.054 --> 08:19.294
Oh, Audrey...

08:19.294 --> 08:20.734
..these are for you.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.974
They were left on the presbytery
doorstep.

08:22.974 --> 08:24.214
INSPECTOR SNEEZES

08:26.134 --> 08:28.414
Did I mention that I hate buses?

08:28.414 --> 08:30.734
Who's been sending you flowers?

08:30.734 --> 08:33.134
They're from the children
in my class, silly,

08:33.134 --> 08:34.974
to wish me good luck.

08:34.974 --> 08:40.813
Now that everyone is here, I've a
very important announcement to make.

08:40.813 --> 08:46.214
We have received news from Canon Fox
that the winner of the competition

08:46.214 --> 08:50.934
will get to perform at this year's
Royal Variety Performance

08:50.934 --> 08:57.454
at the London Coliseum, in front
of Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth.

08:57.454 --> 09:00.334
Now, there will be
a lot of press there today,

09:00.334 --> 09:04.694
so, I beg you,
on your best behaviour, all of you.

09:04.694 --> 09:06.334
Whenever are we not, Mrs M?

09:08.134 --> 09:10.734
All right Derek, we're ready to go.

09:10.734 --> 09:11.734
Right you are.

09:21.694 --> 09:24.374
Hm. Help yourself, sir.

09:24.374 --> 09:27.174
No, thank you, Goodfellow.
I know what fate awaits me

09:27.174 --> 09:29.334
when I see my wife
and daughter in Worcester.

09:29.334 --> 09:33.254
I don't want my last meal to be
a stale, half-eaten teacake!

09:33.254 --> 09:37.294
Now, I want you all
back in the bus in five minutes.

09:39.974 --> 09:42.734
What have
I said to you about smoking?

09:42.734 --> 09:45.374
You two need to take care
of your voices!

09:45.374 --> 09:47.294
Sorry, Mrs McCarthy.

09:47.294 --> 09:49.694
I've been smoking since I was
knee-high to a grasshopper,

09:49.694 --> 09:51.134
Mrs McCarthy.

09:51.134 --> 09:54.214
One more's not going to make
any difference.

09:54.214 --> 09:58.814
Er, I wanted to have
a word about our robes.

09:58.814 --> 10:02.294
Did you see what Hambleston
were wearing last week?

10:02.294 --> 10:06.574
I don't wish to look like
anybody's impoverished cousin.

10:06.574 --> 10:10.814
Lawrence Ashton is
chaplain at HMP Sonning.

10:10.814 --> 10:15.534
Now, he has a whole prison full
of ladies with nothing better to do

10:15.534 --> 10:17.334
than make robes for him.

10:17.334 --> 10:21.774
Whereas I, on the other hand,
had to sew all the robes myself.

10:21.774 --> 10:24.774
And that's very much appreciated.

10:24.774 --> 10:28.894
But if, by some miracle,
we were to win, we might wish to

10:28.894 --> 10:32.974
improve our choral-wear prior to
performing for the Queen.

10:32.974 --> 10:36.254
Yes, well, we'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

10:38.134 --> 10:41.294
Does anyone know who's in there?
Because they are taking an age.

10:41.294 --> 10:42.334
Did you knock?

10:42.334 --> 10:44.774
Yes, but no-one answered. Oh.

10:44.774 --> 10:45.774
CLATTERING

10:45.774 --> 10:46.894

10:49.654 --> 10:50.694
Anybody in there?

10:52.294 --> 10:53.734
Goodfellow, barge this door down.

10:53.734 --> 10:54.894
Let me try.

10:57.334 --> 11:00.134
I've got a new hypothesis
about the Kembleford burglar.

11:00.134 --> 11:01.214
LOCK CLUNKS

11:08.734 --> 11:11.654
And you've no memory of what
happened? Not really.

11:11.654 --> 11:13.734
I thought I heard something
outside the window,

11:13.734 --> 11:15.214
so I opened it to take a look.

11:15.214 --> 11:17.534
And the next thing I remember is
all of you standing above me.

11:17.534 --> 11:22.014
Do you think it's possible that
you just fainted? Maybe.

11:22.014 --> 11:24.574
I don't know.
It's all so embarrassing.

11:24.574 --> 11:26.774
We should get you checked out.
Oh, no, I'm fine, really.

11:26.774 --> 11:28.814
Right, come along, come along.

11:28.814 --> 11:31.374
We don't want to be late, do we?

11:31.374 --> 11:32.894
Excuse me...

11:32.894 --> 11:33.974
Cigarette.

11:37.694 --> 11:40.214
Good. Now, we're all here.

11:40.214 --> 11:41.334

11:50.974 --> 11:53.934
Derek, let us be on our way.

11:53.934 --> 11:56.254
ENGINE TURNS OVER

11:56.254 --> 11:57.934
IT STRUGGLES

12:00.934 --> 12:02.974
ENGINE STARTS

12:34.134 --> 12:38.054
ENGINE BACKFIRES

12:49.294 --> 12:51.494
The fuel pipe has been punctured.

12:51.494 --> 12:53.334
How can it be punctured?!

12:53.334 --> 12:55.974
Something could've kicked up
off the road.

12:55.974 --> 12:57.214
If not that, then...

12:57.214 --> 13:00.054
The Hambleston Harmonisers.
They were there.

13:00.054 --> 13:02.054
Oh, come on, Mrs M.

13:02.054 --> 13:04.894
You honestly think they'd
stoop to sabotage?

13:04.894 --> 13:07.574
No, I suppose not. Can you fix it?

13:07.574 --> 13:09.254
Not without a replacement part.

13:09.254 --> 13:11.774
The pressure's too high on that
side of the fuel inlet

13:11.774 --> 13:13.214
for us to tape it up.

13:13.214 --> 13:16.094
We wouldn't even make it to the next
village, let alone Worcester.

13:16.094 --> 13:18.734
You all wait here. Goodfellow
and I will walk along the road

13:18.734 --> 13:20.414
until we find a house
with a telephone.

13:20.414 --> 13:23.414
We'll call for a mechanic and...
And how long is that going to take?

13:23.414 --> 13:26.174
I wanted to be in Worcester
by four o'clock.

13:26.174 --> 13:28.254
There is another solution.

13:28.254 --> 13:30.494
We could leave the coach
and the driver here

13:30.494 --> 13:32.094
and walk to Lower Swaddling.

13:32.094 --> 13:35.374
It can't be more than two miles, and
it's a stop on the Worcester line.

13:35.374 --> 13:37.854
Then we could catch a train
the rest of the way.

13:37.854 --> 13:42.294
Yes. Now, everyone, gather up
your music and the hampers.

13:42.294 --> 13:45.174
Look at me, Father.
A couple of miles in these shoes?

13:46.134 --> 13:47.214
Er...

13:50.014 --> 13:52.094
I told you we should have
brought your car!

14:06.334 --> 14:08.094
My point is, Father,

14:08.094 --> 14:10.974
that cleanliness is next to
godliness, am I right?

14:10.974 --> 14:14.214
And an official endorsement
from the church would be doing me

14:14.214 --> 14:16.414
a massive favour.

14:16.414 --> 14:18.254
Well, I'll certainly consider it.

14:18.254 --> 14:19.494
That's all I ask!

14:21.094 --> 14:23.374
I didn't like to say
anything in front of Mrs M

14:23.374 --> 14:26.454
as she's in enough of a flap
already, but I do think

14:26.454 --> 14:28.094
the coach was sabotaged.

14:28.094 --> 14:31.054
The fuel pipe looked like it had
been sawn through with a knife.

14:31.054 --> 14:33.014
But why would anyone want
to do that?

14:33.014 --> 14:34.734
To stop us getting to Worcester,

14:34.734 --> 14:36.134
take out the competition.

14:36.134 --> 14:39.174
Perhaps the same person was
responsible for what happened

14:39.174 --> 14:42.454
to Audrey. She is Kembleford's
star performer, after all.

14:42.454 --> 14:45.894
That's true. And, seeing as
Hambleston just happened to be

14:45.894 --> 14:48.614
passing by the scene of the crime...
It could have been anyone.

14:48.614 --> 14:53.854
For now, it's best to assume that
they were regrettable accidents.

14:53.854 --> 14:57.574
Whilst keeping our eyes open
for anything suspicious?

14:57.574 --> 15:00.494
Could you please pick up the pace?

15:00.494 --> 15:02.534
We're going as fast as we can.

15:02.534 --> 15:06.094
If we miss this train, we'll never
get to Worcester in time.

15:06.094 --> 15:07.814
Hardly our fault.

15:07.814 --> 15:10.254
And what's that supposed to mean?

15:10.254 --> 15:13.534
We never had any trouble
with the old bus company.

15:13.534 --> 15:16.574
It was you who decided to find
a cheaper option.

15:18.574 --> 15:20.214
FLY BUZZES

15:22.214 --> 15:25.694
Perhaps it would be quicker
if we went across country.

15:25.694 --> 15:28.334
How do we even know that's
the right way?

15:28.334 --> 15:30.974
Well, the Cotswolds Way heads
straight for Lower Swaddling

15:30.974 --> 15:32.374
as the crow flies.

15:32.374 --> 15:34.134
Anything to get this over with.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.254
Come on.

15:43.934 --> 15:46.294
What are you doing now?

15:46.294 --> 15:48.414
I thought I might stay here,

15:48.414 --> 15:50.894
try and flag down a passing car,

15:50.894 --> 15:54.134
preferably one with a picnic basket
and a bottle of Champagne.

15:54.134 --> 15:55.334
Please.

15:55.334 --> 15:57.614
You have travelled
halfway round the world.

15:58.974 --> 16:01.454
Another mile or two won't make
any difference now.

16:17.094 --> 16:20.334
Perhaps a sing-song,
help raise morale.

16:20.334 --> 16:22.574
Oh, that's a great idea, Father.

16:22.574 --> 16:25.414
Warm our voices up for later on, eh?

16:25.414 --> 16:26.814

No, thank you, Goodfellow.

If You fancy smiting someone with
a thunderbolt, be my guest.

16:45.294 --> 16:47.134
You'd be doing me a favour.

16:49.054 --> 16:51.814
The competition starts
promptly at five o'clock

16:51.814 --> 16:55.814
with a performance by
the Three Counties Children's Choir.

16:55.814 --> 17:00.254
You're on third, after
the Throckmorton Veterans' Choir.

17:00.254 --> 17:01.534
Thank you.

17:04.013 --> 17:06.414
You're with the Children's Choir,
I take it? Yes.

17:08.454 --> 17:10.493
This all looks fine.

17:10.493 --> 17:12.934
Welcome to Worcester, Miss Mallory.

Oh, well,

17:29.414 --> 17:31.014
He looks very enthusiastic.

17:31.014 --> 17:34.054
MAN: Look out behind you! I think
he's trying to tell us something.

17:34.054 --> 17:35.494
I think I know what that is.

17:37.374 --> 17:39.014
SHE SCREAMS

17:39.014 --> 17:40.334
Don't startle it!

17:40.334 --> 17:43.414
Oh! Sorry. Force of habit.

17:43.414 --> 17:47.094
Everybody start moving very slowly
towards the gate. Yes.

17:47.094 --> 17:49.334
BULL LOWS ANGRILY

17:49.334 --> 17:53.774
My father taught me an old trick to
deal with situations like this.

17:53.774 --> 17:55.534
What was that?

17:55.534 --> 17:58.694
Make sure you get a head
start on everyone else.

18:00.054 --> 18:02.494
Wait up! Oh! Oh, my shoe.

18:02.494 --> 18:03.774
Leave it!

18:03.774 --> 18:07.694
For all we know, it could be made
out of his cousin. What-ho!

18:07.694 --> 18:10.414
Oh! Ah! Oh!

18:14.094 --> 18:15.894
What's wrong, Mother?

18:15.894 --> 18:18.014
I think I may have sprained
my ankle.

18:33.774 --> 18:35.294
Well, I guess that's it, then.

18:35.294 --> 18:38.414
Mrs Curtley can hardly walk to Lower
Swaddling with a sprained ankle.

18:38.414 --> 18:39.654
Not to mention the rain.

18:39.654 --> 18:41.254
Or my lack of footwear.

18:42.134 --> 18:43.934
I feel terrible about what I did.

18:43.934 --> 18:45.374
And so you should.

18:45.374 --> 18:48.374
I panicked. I'm sorry.

18:48.374 --> 18:50.854
Let me go and find help,
make it up to you all.

18:50.854 --> 18:53.334
No. No, I think it's best...
I insist!

18:59.774 --> 19:02.014
Nicholas, please, just leave me be!

19:02.014 --> 19:03.814
Don't be like that. Audrey!

19:10.734 --> 19:12.654
Anything I can do to help?

19:12.654 --> 19:14.614
I wish.

19:14.614 --> 19:17.854
Pre-marriage nerves
are not uncommon.

19:17.854 --> 19:20.094
The course of true love.

19:20.094 --> 19:23.534
I thought true love was about being
honest with each other.

19:23.534 --> 19:27.614
You know, anything you say to me
is between us and God.

19:32.294 --> 19:35.134
I found this picture, in Audrey's
house, of her when she was younger,

19:35.134 --> 19:36.734
with this...

19:36.734 --> 19:38.534
..other fella.

19:38.534 --> 19:41.254
She'd told me she'd never been
with anyone else.

19:41.254 --> 19:43.014
So, I asked her about it.

19:44.174 --> 19:45.734
And what did she say?

19:45.734 --> 19:47.774
That it was her brother.

19:47.774 --> 19:50.294
She's never mentioned
a brother till now.

19:50.294 --> 19:53.334
And when I asked her some questions
about him, she wouldn't say a word.

19:53.334 --> 19:55.734
Now's she's in a mood with me
for not trusting her.

19:57.454 --> 19:59.294
Do you?

19:59.294 --> 20:00.654
Trust her?

20:00.654 --> 20:02.374
I want to. I...

20:02.374 --> 20:04.574
I love her, I really do.
It's just, what...

20:04.574 --> 20:05.774
What if the flowers...?

20:08.774 --> 20:10.054
I'm being daft, aren't I?

20:11.174 --> 20:12.214
I should go find her.

20:16.134 --> 20:17.174
Chin up, sir.

20:19.374 --> 20:20.654
Could be worse.

20:20.654 --> 20:24.494
Worse? We're stuck in a stinking
barn in the middle of nowhere.

20:24.494 --> 20:26.734
I should never have agreed to
get on that bloomin' bus

20:26.734 --> 20:28.134
in the first place.

20:28.134 --> 20:30.174
I was only trying to help, sir.

20:32.014 --> 20:34.694
Look, it's not just the rollicking
I'll be getting off the wife.

20:37.214 --> 20:38.614
You know what this job is like.

20:38.614 --> 20:41.014
When it comes to the kids,
I've missed a lot of...

20:42.374 --> 20:44.334
..you know...

20:44.334 --> 20:45.614
..important moments.

20:48.454 --> 20:50.374
I wanted to be there for this one.

20:51.414 --> 20:52.934
You never know, sir.

20:52.934 --> 20:54.734
We might still make it.

20:54.734 --> 20:58.134
Let's face it, Goodfellow,
it would take a miracle.

20:59.214 --> 21:00.734
WOMAN SCREAMS

21:02.174 --> 21:04.054
Well, don't look at me!

21:17.894 --> 21:20.734
Maybe it would be wise
if we all just went home.

21:20.734 --> 21:23.414
And give in to some bully? Never!

21:23.414 --> 21:26.454
Let's be sensible, Mrs M. Barbara
can't walk, I've got one shoe,

21:26.454 --> 21:28.774
and, even if we do make it to
Lower Swaddling,

21:28.774 --> 21:30.134
we'll never catch the train.

21:30.134 --> 21:32.374
Oh, yes, and somebody's
threatened to kill us!

21:32.374 --> 21:33.974
Here you are!

21:33.974 --> 21:35.614
And where have you been?

21:35.614 --> 21:37.454
In the woods.
I was looking for Audrey.

21:37.454 --> 21:40.334
I heard the scream, turned back,
got a bit lost.

21:40.334 --> 21:42.094
And I saw the writing.

21:42.094 --> 21:45.734
Somebody doesn't want the Kembleford
Choristers to perform tonight.

21:45.734 --> 21:49.614
Perhaps you're not keen on Audrey
singing in front of the Queen.

21:49.614 --> 21:52.254
Think she'll become a big star
and trade you in for a better model?

21:52.254 --> 21:55.094
I would never do that! And if you're
looking for a suspect,

21:55.094 --> 21:56.614
where's Wesley? That's right.

21:56.614 --> 21:59.334
He was having a good old moan
in rehearsals about Audrey

21:59.334 --> 22:00.894
getting all the best solos.

22:00.894 --> 22:03.934
He seems to think
he's the next Nat King Cole.

22:03.934 --> 22:07.014
And he's clearly already
well-known to the Inspector.

22:07.014 --> 22:09.654
To be fair, that was
a private matter.

22:09.654 --> 22:11.254
He sold the wife a feather duster

22:11.254 --> 22:13.734
that was rather too quick
to shed its plumage.

22:13.734 --> 22:16.614
Right. Still, he dropped us
all in it with that bull,

22:16.614 --> 22:18.254
and now he's done a runner again.

22:18.254 --> 22:19.654
MAN WHISTLES

22:22.254 --> 22:26.054
So, he made ready his chariot,
and took all his people with him.

22:26.054 --> 22:28.414
I managed to persuade
the farmer to give us

22:28.414 --> 22:30.254
a lift to the train station.

22:30.254 --> 22:33.054
On the back of that? What fun!

22:33.054 --> 22:34.734
That's very kind, sir.

22:34.734 --> 22:37.974
Kind? It cost me a pack of Brillo
pads and a tin of boot polish.

22:37.974 --> 22:39.854
But, still,
a small price to make amends.

22:41.214 --> 22:43.654
Do you still think we might
be able to make that train?

22:43.654 --> 22:45.654
Have faith, Mrs McCarthy.

22:45.654 --> 22:49.734
Not to put a dampener on things, but
what about Barbara and Aunt Fliss?

22:49.734 --> 22:51.574
Well, the Inspector and I
can help Mrs Curtley

22:51.574 --> 22:53.454
on the back of the trailer.

22:53.454 --> 22:57.854
And, as for the lovely Lady Felicia,
I have a present for her.

22:57.854 --> 22:58.894
Oh...

23:00.054 --> 23:02.254
Belonged to the farmer's wife.

23:02.254 --> 23:04.574
She loved these boots, he said.

23:04.574 --> 23:06.974
She was even wearing them
when she passed. Oh, well...

23:06.974 --> 23:09.014
I think they rather suit you.

23:09.014 --> 23:10.014
Ah...

23:11.654 --> 23:14.494
So, you don't think it was
Hambleston, after all?

23:14.494 --> 23:17.534
How would they find us
all the way out here?

23:17.534 --> 23:20.054
I reckon one of this lot
wrote that message.

23:20.054 --> 23:23.294
Why would one of us
want to sabotage our own choir?

23:23.294 --> 23:26.534
And why would anyone want to
do that to Audrey?

23:26.534 --> 23:28.534
FATHER BROWN CLEARS THROAT

23:28.534 --> 23:31.294
Pray, enlighten us, Padre.

23:31.294 --> 23:33.454
There are a number of possibilities.

23:36.614 --> 23:40.694
Resentment at another's success
after they themselves have failed...

23:41.974 --> 23:43.774
..fear of losing a loved one...

23:44.814 --> 23:48.094
..anger at not being
the centre of attention.

23:48.094 --> 23:49.654
Poppycock.

23:49.654 --> 23:52.814
It'll be about money, mark my words.

23:52.814 --> 23:55.334
Big deal,
performing in front of the Queen.

23:55.334 --> 23:58.734
Could lead to lucrative
career opportunities.

23:58.734 --> 24:02.654
Someone here has been
paid off by a rival choir.

24:02.654 --> 24:04.654
So, what do we do?

24:04.654 --> 24:06.894
Keep everyone together
and stay alert.

24:06.894 --> 24:09.534
They'll make a mistake.
They always do.

24:15.054 --> 24:17.894
Mr Ashton,
how delightful to have you back.

24:17.894 --> 24:21.134
I trust your team are in fine voice.

24:21.134 --> 24:24.454
They would give the cherubim
and seraphim a run for their money.

24:24.454 --> 24:27.214
I must say, performing
in the West End has always been

24:27.214 --> 24:28.534
a lifelong dream. Ah...

24:30.054 --> 24:32.334
You haven't seen the Kembleford lot,
have you?

24:32.334 --> 24:34.214
Time is...getting on.

24:35.174 --> 24:36.774
Can't say that I have.

24:40.854 --> 24:44.294
STEAM ENGINE CHUGS

24:44.294 --> 24:47.934
Quick! Would you put your foot down?

24:47.934 --> 24:52.214
I suspect, Mrs M,
we may already be at top speed.

24:52.214 --> 24:55.174
I'd suggest throwing
Inspector Mallory overboard

24:55.174 --> 24:58.294
to lighten the load, but I doubt
it would make much difference.

25:04.134 --> 25:06.574
TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS

25:13.534 --> 25:15.374
Wait here.

25:19.254 --> 25:22.254
Excuse me, was that the Worcester
train that's just departed?

25:22.254 --> 25:23.694
Sorry?

25:23.694 --> 25:26.214
Has the Worcester train
left already?

25:29.294 --> 25:31.894
Oh, why has Thou forsaken me?

25:31.894 --> 25:34.334
The train that has just left,

25:34.334 --> 25:36.974
was that the Worcester train?

25:37.934 --> 25:39.814
And when is the next one?

25:50.294 --> 25:52.854
Oh, I'm really in for it
this time, Goodfellow.

25:52.854 --> 25:56.374
There aren't enough chocolates and
flowers in the world to save me now.

25:58.414 --> 25:59.454
Goodfellow?

26:02.294 --> 26:03.334
Typical.

26:10.974 --> 26:12.894
We've worked so hard.

26:12.894 --> 26:14.694
There's always next year.

26:14.694 --> 26:16.694
Only if we don't get blacklisted.

26:16.694 --> 26:18.534
If it makes you feel any better,

26:18.534 --> 26:20.974
at least you're not wearing
a dead woman's shoes.

26:22.614 --> 26:25.454
Perhaps we should just head
back to Kembleford.

26:25.454 --> 26:27.294
What about the competition?

26:27.294 --> 26:29.974
It'll be over before
we get there, anyway.

26:29.974 --> 26:32.334
My head hurts, and...

26:32.334 --> 26:34.374
..I just want to go home.

26:38.254 --> 26:40.254
Were those flowers
really from the children?

26:41.694 --> 26:42.694
Of course.

26:45.574 --> 26:47.014
So much for singing for the Queen.

26:47.014 --> 26:49.454
Wesley, now's not a really good
ti... I know what you all

26:49.454 --> 26:50.814
think of me.

26:50.814 --> 26:53.694
But, since the day
I arrived in this country,

26:53.694 --> 26:55.894
all I've done is try to get by.

26:55.894 --> 26:57.334
That such a bad thing?

26:58.974 --> 27:02.014
I finally thought
I might achieve something.

27:03.294 --> 27:04.814
Win a bit of respect, you know?

27:06.774 --> 27:08.374
Who am I kidding?

27:09.854 --> 27:13.374
Now, where has Father Brown
disappeared to?

27:13.374 --> 27:14.574
HORN HONKS

27:25.574 --> 27:28.014
Courtesy of the
Lower Swaddling Constabulary.

27:28.014 --> 27:29.854
Father Brown's idea.

27:29.854 --> 27:31.414
And they just lent it to you?

27:31.414 --> 27:34.454
Turns out I used to play rugby with
the Superintendent.

27:34.454 --> 27:36.374
In that case, get out. I'm driving.

27:40.094 --> 27:42.214
Come on. Right.

27:46.774 --> 27:49.934
INDISTINCT CHATTER

27:52.814 --> 27:55.414
So, then, we are agreed?

27:55.414 --> 27:58.374
If the Kembleford Choristers
don't arrive by five o'clock...

28:00.734 --> 28:02.774
That gives them...

28:02.774 --> 28:04.374
..15 minutes.

28:06.614 --> 28:10.934
SHEEP BLEAT

28:20.014 --> 28:21.174
What's this?

28:21.174 --> 28:23.694
I hope they're the right size.
Wasn't much choice.

28:25.294 --> 28:28.134
Oh! Sergeant!

28:28.134 --> 28:30.374
How? Lower Swaddling Police Station.

28:30.374 --> 28:32.854
Please tell me
they're not taken from a corpse.

28:32.854 --> 28:34.214
No, nothing like that.

28:34.214 --> 28:37.574
Unclaimed lost property left over
from the May Day celebrations.

28:37.574 --> 28:40.534
Sergeant, I am going to
personally recommend you

28:40.534 --> 28:43.174
for the highest honour
the Police Force can bestow.

28:43.174 --> 28:44.814
No need for that, Your Ladyship.

28:44.814 --> 28:46.134
Oh!

29:02.094 --> 29:04.694
Right, quick! Everyone, follow me.

29:05.814 --> 29:08.374
Sergeant,
do you still have the robes?

29:09.574 --> 29:13.854
Now, you can all start getting
changed while I go and register.

29:13.854 --> 29:16.494
Father,
can you look after Mrs Curtley,

29:16.494 --> 29:19.094
see if you can find her
a walking stick or something?

29:19.094 --> 29:20.774
I need to spend a penny.

29:20.774 --> 29:23.014
Yes, all right, go. But be quick!

29:27.534 --> 29:30.134
The Children's Choir -
where are they performing?

29:30.134 --> 29:31.974
I'm afraid you've just missed them.

29:33.134 --> 29:35.054
The Kembleford Choristers.

29:35.054 --> 29:36.374
What about them?

29:36.374 --> 29:37.734
Well, we're here!

29:45.174 --> 29:47.214
Anything I can do to help?

29:47.214 --> 29:49.574
No, I don't think so,
thank you, Father.

29:51.094 --> 29:52.494
Where's Audrey?

29:52.494 --> 29:54.374
Still powdering her nose.

29:54.374 --> 29:57.494
The nerves do tend to play
havoc...with her digestive system.

29:58.734 --> 30:00.974
We don't all need to hear about it,
Nicholas.

30:00.974 --> 30:03.894
Is it just me or are we all wilfully
ignoring the fact that

30:03.894 --> 30:06.414
someone has threatened to kill us
if we sing tonight?

30:06.414 --> 30:09.694
I, for one, will not be
intimidated by an idle threat.

30:09.694 --> 30:10.934
SHE SCOFFS

30:10.934 --> 30:13.974
You weren't that courageous when
faced with that bull, Mr Summerton.

30:13.974 --> 30:16.894
I suppose it suits you, all of this.

30:16.894 --> 30:20.494
Even more of a disaster
than last year.

30:20.494 --> 30:23.174
You'll be angling for your old
job as choir leader back.

30:23.174 --> 30:25.374
What are you implying?

30:25.374 --> 30:27.414
Come on, let's not fall out.

30:27.414 --> 30:29.414
We've still got to sing together.

30:29.414 --> 30:32.254
No, you don't.

30:32.254 --> 30:34.534
What do you mean, Mrs M?

30:34.534 --> 30:36.214
We've been disqualified.

30:38.214 --> 30:39.454
What?!

30:46.654 --> 30:48.494
You!

30:48.494 --> 30:50.534
The rules are perfectly clear.

30:50.534 --> 30:53.534
All choirs must
register by five o'clock.

30:53.534 --> 30:55.614
Everyone else managed it.

30:55.614 --> 30:57.454
Surely you can make an exception.

30:57.454 --> 31:00.694
While I may have the honour of
organising the choir competition,

31:00.694 --> 31:03.134
it will not have escaped your notice
that we are in

31:03.134 --> 31:04.974
an Anglican Cathedral.

31:06.174 --> 31:08.614
I can hardly be seen to show
favouritism to a choir

31:08.614 --> 31:11.654
from a Catholic church
from my own patch.

31:11.654 --> 31:16.414
Surely, you don't... The perception
of fairness is paramount!

31:16.414 --> 31:20.374
And was it fair that our choir
had their star singer attacked,

31:20.374 --> 31:23.414
or their bus sabotaged?

31:23.414 --> 31:25.254
Sabotaged? I...

31:25.254 --> 31:27.454
Presumably by one of the
competitors.

31:27.454 --> 31:30.734
And it would hardly look good on the
competition, or the organisers

31:30.734 --> 31:33.614
of the competition, if such
goings-on were to find their way

31:33.614 --> 31:34.894
into the national press.

31:37.054 --> 31:39.694
CONGREGATION APPLAUDS

31:41.494 --> 31:43.134
He's going to allow us to sing!

31:43.134 --> 31:44.934
Oh, thank the good Lord.

31:44.934 --> 31:47.414
We must hurry.
We're on in a few minutes.

31:47.414 --> 31:50.454
What about Audrey? Oh, don't worry,
I'll find her.

31:51.654 --> 31:52.734
Can I help?

31:53.734 --> 31:55.294
No.

31:55.294 --> 31:57.174
Find Inspector Mallory.

31:57.174 --> 31:58.974
There's something he should know.

32:01.494 --> 32:06.254
"JERUSALEM" PLAYS IN BACKGROUND

32:07.974 --> 32:09.854
FATHER BROWN CLEARS THROAT

32:11.814 --> 32:13.014
I can't sing.

32:14.134 --> 32:15.854
Well, that is not true.

32:15.854 --> 32:17.254
You know what I mean.

32:18.414 --> 32:19.374
Yes.

32:21.414 --> 32:23.214
How's your head feeling now?

32:24.414 --> 32:25.574
A little sore.

32:27.854 --> 32:31.894
Well, it was an awkward window
to get through.

32:34.934 --> 32:36.774
After you sabotaged the coach.

32:36.774 --> 32:38.414
WHISPERS: How?

32:38.414 --> 32:42.374
There was dirt on the back
of your dress

32:42.374 --> 32:44.694
when we picked you up off the floor.

32:44.694 --> 32:47.934
Only the floor itself had
recently been cleaned.

32:49.734 --> 32:52.014
Your dress got dirty...

32:52.014 --> 32:55.054
..when you were underneath
the coach cutting the fuel line.

32:55.054 --> 32:58.294
But it proved more difficult
to climb back in.

32:58.294 --> 33:00.934
I couldn't be sure, of course.

33:00.934 --> 33:05.814
But then...it was you who found
the threatening sign

33:05.814 --> 33:07.254
on the barn wall.

33:09.014 --> 33:11.894
And you had plenty of time
to write it yourself.

33:11.894 --> 33:14.534
What reason could I possibly have?
Fear.

33:16.134 --> 33:19.614
You were being threatened by someone
who didn't want you to perform.

33:25.334 --> 33:27.734
The envelope was in the bunch of
flowers.

33:27.734 --> 33:29.174
It contained a card.

33:31.214 --> 33:32.774
What did the card say?

33:34.494 --> 33:36.694
It told you not to come here,
didn't it?

33:39.534 --> 33:42.174
I recognised the handwriting...

33:42.174 --> 33:44.374
..from the choir register.

33:44.374 --> 33:46.014
Father, please, just leave me be.

33:47.054 --> 33:48.974
Tell the others to perform
without me.

33:50.294 --> 33:52.774
So that your big secret
won't come out?

33:54.974 --> 33:59.454
That you spent time at Her Majesty's
Prison Sonning?

34:01.854 --> 34:06.694
Because that's where Lawrence Ashton
is chaplain, isn't it?

34:06.694 --> 34:09.574
You! Didn't you get my flowers?

34:11.414 --> 34:13.853
This is your last chance.

34:13.853 --> 34:16.293
Pull out of the competition
or everyone will know

34:16.293 --> 34:17.654
your dirty little secret.

34:22.014 --> 34:24.134
I presume you haven't told Nicholas.

34:25.454 --> 34:27.893
No, he mustn't find out. Ever.
He would leave me.

34:28.893 --> 34:32.974
I have a life, a future.
It would destroy everything!

34:34.574 --> 34:37.414
Don't be afraid of Lawrence Ashton.

34:37.414 --> 34:38.694
He's being taken care of.

34:40.654 --> 34:44.293
# All things bright and beautiful

34:44.293 --> 34:49.614
# All creatures great and small

34:49.614 --> 34:53.893
# All things wise and wonderful

34:53.893 --> 34:59.254
♪ The Lord God made them all. ♪

35:08.334 --> 35:10.334
We are so close to our prize.

35:10.334 --> 35:12.334
There are no excuses
for second place.

35:12.334 --> 35:13.774
INSPECTOR CLEARS THROAT

35:13.774 --> 35:15.414
A word. Sorry,
but I'm in the middle of...

35:15.414 --> 35:18.454
In private...if you'd be so kind.

35:19.854 --> 35:21.294
She's lying.

35:27.774 --> 35:29.214
Tell me about your brother.

35:34.734 --> 35:38.374
When Mum and Dad died,
it was just him and me in the house.

35:39.814 --> 35:41.854
It hit him hard, their deaths.

35:44.054 --> 35:46.094
He started drinking.

35:46.094 --> 35:48.334
Over time, he got worse and worse.

35:49.734 --> 35:53.014
He was always shouting at me,
wanting me to do everything for him.

35:53.014 --> 35:55.614
And then he started using his fists.

35:55.614 --> 35:57.414
You must have been terrified.

36:00.654 --> 36:04.134
One morning, I burnt his breakfast.

36:05.854 --> 36:08.374
And he stormed into the kitchen,

36:08.374 --> 36:10.654
threw the plate at me.

36:10.654 --> 36:12.334
Then he picked up a knife.

36:13.694 --> 36:14.854
And I...

36:16.254 --> 36:19.294
I still had the frying
pan in my hand, and...

36:19.294 --> 36:20.534
He died.

36:24.894 --> 36:29.654
The police thought I did it
for his share of the inheritance.

36:29.654 --> 36:31.974
Not that there was much to inherit.

36:34.014 --> 36:37.054
I pleaded guilty to manslaughter...

36:37.054 --> 36:39.134
..and did ten years.

36:39.134 --> 36:40.534
And you never told Nicholas?

36:43.534 --> 36:45.414
I was 19 when I went in.

36:47.014 --> 36:49.654
I'd never even
been on a date with a boy.

36:52.174 --> 36:55.574
I got out, moved to Kembleford,

36:55.574 --> 36:57.374
somewhere no-one knew me.

36:57.374 --> 36:58.614
Where you met Nicholas.

37:00.214 --> 37:05.174
He was so kind, so...gentle.

37:07.134 --> 37:09.134
I couldn't bear him
knowing what I had done.

37:10.774 --> 37:14.534
And, as the months went on,
it got harder to find the words.

37:16.974 --> 37:19.694
All I wanted was a new start,

37:19.694 --> 37:22.414
my own life, and now it's just being
ripped into pieces.

37:25.054 --> 37:28.014
The police will deal
with Lawrence Ashton.

37:30.094 --> 37:32.334
As for Nicholas...

37:32.334 --> 37:34.414
..you are engaged to be married.

37:36.134 --> 37:39.494
How can you give yourself to him
before God

37:39.494 --> 37:41.694
unless you are willing
to open your heart?

37:44.334 --> 37:47.374
If you love him, tell him the truth.

37:48.774 --> 37:51.774
If he loves you, he will understand.

37:55.894 --> 37:59.334
But, first,
you have some singing to do.

38:02.774 --> 38:04.454
I can't do this! What do you mean?

38:04.454 --> 38:06.814
I don't know what I'm doing.
I haven't rehearsed.

38:06.814 --> 38:09.094
I'm going to make an utter
fool of myself!

38:09.094 --> 38:11.614
It's like that nightmare you have
when you're back at school.

38:11.614 --> 38:13.054
Now, you listen to me.

38:13.054 --> 38:16.054
You have been singing these hymns
since you were a little girl.

38:16.054 --> 38:20.654
All you have to do is follow
the music and listen to the others.

38:20.654 --> 38:22.574
You can do this, Aunt Fliss.

38:24.414 --> 38:26.014
Right. You're on.

38:26.014 --> 38:27.974
Audrey's not back yet.

38:27.974 --> 38:29.694
Perhaps you could stand in for her.

38:29.694 --> 38:32.654
Me? Oh, no, I can't...
You could mime.

38:32.654 --> 38:35.294
I think you've kept us
all waiting long enough!

38:35.294 --> 38:36.734
What's it to be?

38:36.734 --> 38:37.934
Oh, here she is.

38:37.934 --> 38:39.854
Sorry!

38:39.854 --> 38:41.574
Right. Everyone ready?

38:50.334 --> 38:58.374
# Ave Maria

39:01.934 --> 39:09.814
# Gratia plena

39:09.814 --> 39:12.854
# Maria

39:12.854 --> 39:18.534
# Gratia plena

39:18.534 --> 39:26.054
# Maria, gratia plena

39:26.054 --> 39:33.774
# Ave, ave dominus

39:33.774 --> 39:37.694
# Dominus tecum

39:38.654 --> 39:42.934
# Benedicta tu

39:42.934 --> 39:47.014
# In mulieribus

39:47.014 --> 39:55.134
# Et benedictus

39:55.134 --> 39:59.214
# Et benedictus

39:59.214 --> 40:03.854
# Fructus ventris

40:03.854 --> 40:11.774
# Ventris tuae, Jesus

40:13.214 --> 40:21.134
# Ave Maria

40:45.054 --> 40:50.174
I still can't believe I won!
Be-believe...you won.

40:50.174 --> 40:52.254
Yes, we ALL won.

40:52.254 --> 40:54.134
The look on Canon Fox's face

40:54.134 --> 40:57.294
when he handed you that trophy
was an absolute treat.

40:57.294 --> 40:58.934
Hello, Father.

40:58.934 --> 41:01.254
Sergeant Goodfellow, I thought
you were on your way home.

41:01.254 --> 41:02.374
GOODFELLOW LAUGHS

41:02.374 --> 41:03.654
Not quite yet, Father.

41:03.654 --> 41:06.214
I just wanted to let you know that
Lawrence Ashton confessed

41:06.214 --> 41:07.254
to threatening Audrey.

41:07.254 --> 41:09.894
He's offered to pay for the damages
to the coach, so...

41:09.894 --> 41:12.534
Well, looks like he'll get off
with a slap on the wrist.

41:12.534 --> 41:15.374
Hardly punishment enough
after what he did.

41:15.374 --> 41:17.774
If it's any consolation, he will
almost certainly

41:17.774 --> 41:20.454
lose his job at the prison.
Thank you again, Sergeant,

41:20.454 --> 41:22.574
for saving me from
that dead woman's boots.

41:22.574 --> 41:25.494
If there's ever anything
I can do to repay you...

41:25.494 --> 41:28.534
Now that you mention it,
there is one thing.

41:28.534 --> 41:31.894
Hate to ask.
I know it's been a long day, but...

41:33.254 --> 41:34.854
..I could do with a favour.

41:37.694 --> 41:39.934
What on Earth are we doing here,
Goodfellow?

41:39.934 --> 41:42.574
I need to get home before
the wife finishes sharpening

41:42.574 --> 41:44.174
the carving knife!

41:44.174 --> 41:46.454
Well, I know how disappointed
you were, sir,

41:46.454 --> 41:48.254
that you missed her performance.

41:48.254 --> 41:51.334
And I told them how hard you tried
to get there on time.

ORGAN BEGINS "ABIDE WITH ME"

42:14.534 --> 42:18.254
# Abide with me

42:18.254 --> 42:25.214
# Fast falls the eventide

42:25.214 --> 42:30.494
# The darkness deepens

42:30.494 --> 42:35.814
# Lord, with me abide

42:35.814 --> 42:42.294
# When other helpers fail

42:42.294 --> 42:46.534
# And comforts flee

42:46.534 --> 42:51.134
# Help of the helpless

42:51.134 --> 42:57.694
# Oh, abide with me

43:00.974 --> 43:04.254
# Swift to its close

43:04.254 --> 43:10.334
# Ebbs out life's little day

43:11.494 --> 43:15.614
# Earth's joys grow dim

43:15.614 --> 43:22.654
# Its glories pass away

43:22.654 --> 43:26.574
# Change and decay

43:26.574 --> 43:33.934
# In all around I see

43:33.934 --> 43:38.774
# O Thou who changest not
