(audience applauds)

00:19.954 --> 00:21.453
Ah... wine.

00:21.455 --> 00:22.821
The last refuge.

00:22.823 --> 00:24.663
(canned laughter) Or the first.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.894
(canned laughter)

00:28.896 --> 00:30.195
Hey, Mom,

00:30.197 --> 00:31.663
did you call a car mechanic?

00:31.665 --> 00:32.898
Honey, the heater's broken.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.500
Why would I call
a car mechanic...?

00:34.502 --> 00:36.902
I most certainly did.

00:36.904 --> 00:38.570
(canned laughter)
Why'd you do that?

00:38.572 --> 00:40.172
Well, cars have heaters,
and I'm sure

00:40.174 --> 00:42.875
this lovely young gentleman
could help fix our radiator.

00:42.877 --> 00:44.410
No... ma'am.

00:44.412 --> 00:46.311
Oh, well, then I guess
this glass of wine

00:46.313 --> 00:48.347
is going in the microwave.

00:48.349 --> 00:50.582
(laughs)
They cut my second line.

00:50.584 --> 00:53.719
Without that, my character's
exit is completely unmotivated.

00:53.721 --> 00:55.821
You were great, honey.

00:55.823 --> 00:57.089
Oh, and look,

00:57.091 --> 00:59.525
there's your name
in the credits.

00:59.527 --> 01:00.592
Hot Mechanic?

01:00.594 --> 01:02.161
His name was Chip Lubbock.

01:02.163 --> 01:04.897
Well, Hot Mechanic works for me.

01:04.899 --> 01:07.499
No, honey,
this is important to me.

01:07.501 --> 01:10.235
I wrote an eight-page character
diary for Chip Lubbock

01:10.237 --> 01:11.837
of Galveston, Texas.

01:11.839 --> 01:13.372
His father was a deep-sea
oil rig worker

01:13.374 --> 01:14.940
who abandoned him at birth.

01:14.942 --> 01:18.444
How is the audience ever
supposed to get any of that now?

01:18.446 --> 01:20.612
I don't think
anybody was gonna get

01:20.614 --> 01:22.614
any of that anyway, hon.

01:22.616 --> 01:25.717
(scoffs)
Well, now we'll never know.

01:25.719 --> 01:28.153
¶ ¶

01:31.959 --> 01:33.792
Morning, Debrah.

01:33.794 --> 01:35.227
I cannot believe this.

01:35.229 --> 01:36.295
Baffling, right?

01:36.297 --> 01:37.996
Yeah. Yeah.

01:40.134 --> 01:41.600
This is crazy, huh, Claire?

01:41.602 --> 01:43.368
Who do you think did this?

01:43.370 --> 01:46.371
No idea, Todd. Yeah, me neither.

01:47.741 --> 01:48.974
The Big Man!

01:48.976 --> 01:50.375
Todd, get the hell out of here.

01:50.377 --> 01:51.477
Did I do something wrong?

01:51.479 --> 01:52.978
No, I'm trying to think.

01:52.980 --> 01:55.114
(quietly): Okay. Good luck.

01:55.116 --> 01:58.717
(singsongy, whispering):
Nobody, nobody, nobody knows.

01:58.719 --> 01:59.952
What the hell, Todd?

01:59.954 --> 02:01.153
Was all this really necessary?

02:01.155 --> 02:02.821
You said get him back because

02:02.823 --> 02:05.090
your dad won't let you represent
him without The Grinder.

02:05.092 --> 02:08.093
I said rough it up a little bit,
not destroy the place.

02:08.095 --> 02:09.728
Well, I had to sell it, Stewart.

02:09.730 --> 02:12.998
You think Dean has never seen
a "fake break-in" before?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.133
I had to go big.

02:14.135 --> 02:16.502
If anything,
I didn't go big enough.

02:16.504 --> 02:18.403
You burned photos
of my children, Todd.

02:18.405 --> 02:20.639
Whoa, whoa, Stew, what...
Put that down!

02:20.641 --> 02:22.307
This is a live crime scene.

02:22.309 --> 02:23.575
Now, has anybody called this in?

02:23.577 --> 02:24.810
Uh, I did, yes.

02:24.812 --> 02:26.278
I, uh, I telephoned
Captain, um...

02:26.280 --> 02:27.946
Phillips.

02:27.948 --> 02:30.015
Captain Phillips, yep.

02:30.017 --> 02:31.416
Good, so Phillips is
our point guy on this?

02:31.418 --> 02:32.684
All right,
what's his badge number?

02:32.686 --> 02:34.019
I should probably reach out.

02:34.021 --> 02:35.420
You know what, uh, Dean,
I'm glad you're back

02:35.422 --> 02:36.855
and I'm glad The Grinder's back.

02:36.857 --> 02:38.190
I think we're all very
excited about that.

02:38.192 --> 02:39.958
Guys, I just feel like, Dean,

02:39.960 --> 02:41.827
maybe we should focus
your energies

02:41.829 --> 02:44.096
on getting ready for the
deposition for Dad's case.

02:44.098 --> 02:45.197
Eh, the depo's a cake walk.

02:45.199 --> 02:46.665
Cake walk. It's a cake walk?

02:46.667 --> 02:48.333
Yeah, throw a few bluffs at him,

02:48.335 --> 02:50.369
sit back, watch him wet himself.

02:50.371 --> 02:51.503
Right, so you haven't
prepared at all?

02:51.505 --> 02:53.505
Stewart,
my entire life has been prep

02:53.507 --> 02:55.174
for this very moment.

02:55.176 --> 02:56.642
For this moment right now?
For this moment right now.

02:56.644 --> 02:57.643
I didn't know that.

02:57.645 --> 02:59.111
It's an easy grind.

02:59.113 --> 03:01.747
Guy will be wetting himself
in no time.

03:03.284 --> 03:06.018
Does he have a condition
that I don't know about?

03:06.020 --> 03:07.953
I don't know.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.454
DEBBIE: <i>So exciting</i>

03:09.456 --> 03:10.689
that we got to come out.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.224
Congrats on your engagement,
you guys.

03:12.226 --> 03:13.559
Yeah, I was just...

03:13.561 --> 03:16.962
Dean and I are so thrilled
to share this with you guys.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.964
Yes.

03:18.966 --> 03:19.998
Us, too.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.200
Uh, is there a story?

03:21.202 --> 03:24.403
Well, Kelly gave
me an ultimatum,

03:24.405 --> 03:25.904
and time ran out.

03:25.906 --> 03:27.039
It was so romantic.

03:27.041 --> 03:28.574
That is.

03:30.477 --> 03:33.879
Oh, um, we... we got to see your
episode of<i> Fran of the House.</i>

03:33.881 --> 03:35.314
Oh, Dean! It was amazing.

03:35.316 --> 03:36.348
That was huge!

03:36.350 --> 03:37.382
What's next?

03:37.384 --> 03:40.085
Kelly and I are
moving to Indiana.

03:40.087 --> 03:41.053
What? Why?

03:41.055 --> 03:42.554
Well, we... We feel like

03:42.556 --> 03:45.591
two years is a fair amount
of time to see if Dean

03:45.593 --> 03:47.259
could become a superstar.

03:47.261 --> 03:48.527
That time came and went.

03:48.529 --> 03:49.728
Right, Poops?

03:49.730 --> 03:51.029
It's just not my destiny.

03:51.031 --> 03:52.364
And that's okay.

03:52.366 --> 03:54.199
Because who's my superstar?

03:54.201 --> 03:55.500
I am.

03:55.502 --> 03:56.868
You are. 'Cause you're it.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.270
'Cause you're super-duper to me.

03:58.272 --> 04:00.105
Tell them about your new job.

04:00.107 --> 04:01.907
Oh, uh, so tomorrow,

04:01.909 --> 04:04.109
I'm going to be interviewing
with Kelly's father

04:04.111 --> 04:06.278
who owns a commercial
freezer door company.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.846
Dean, you're really
quitting acting?

04:07.848 --> 04:09.581
Well... Honestly...

04:09.583 --> 04:11.750
he's been much happier
ever since he gave up show biz.

04:11.752 --> 04:12.918
Right, Poops?

04:12.920 --> 04:14.353
Mm-hmm.

04:16.957 --> 04:19.224
What happened to
your, uh, office?

04:19.226 --> 04:21.360
Why don't you tell us. What?

04:21.362 --> 04:23.462
Uh, Mr. Manler,
in your statement,

04:23.464 --> 04:25.297
you allege that Sanderson & Yao
misrepresented you

04:25.299 --> 04:27.432
in your shoplifting dispute.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.201
Now, my...

04:30.137 --> 04:31.436
You know what that is?

04:31.438 --> 04:33.272
I think it's an envelope.

04:33.274 --> 04:35.474
Oh, uh, sorry, guys,
I wasn't rolling on that.

04:35.476 --> 04:36.908
So you... you need
the envelope toss again?

04:36.910 --> 04:37.909
Oh, my God.

04:37.911 --> 04:38.944
I don't think we need it.

04:38.946 --> 04:39.945
It would help, yeah.

04:39.947 --> 04:40.979
Here you go.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.748
TODD: Okay...

04:42.750 --> 04:45.317
and... three,

04:45.319 --> 04:46.818
two... (mouths)

04:48.922 --> 04:50.922
You know what that is?
It's an envelope.

04:50.924 --> 04:53.158
Inside that envelope is a name:

04:53.160 --> 04:57.129
The name of a man that you have
secretly been working with.

04:57.131 --> 04:59.331
The mastermind
behind all of this.

04:59.333 --> 05:00.999
Sounds like a bluff. It's not.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.234
So you can either be

05:02.236 --> 05:04.136
the bigger person
and just tell us who it is,

05:04.138 --> 05:05.404
or I will be forced

05:05.406 --> 05:06.972
to open that envelope.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.307
All right, op... You know what?

05:08.309 --> 05:10.108
I'll do it. Wait, wh-wh...

05:10.110 --> 05:12.177
(stammering)

05:12.179 --> 05:14.179
"Grinder rests"?

05:14.181 --> 05:15.347
Yeah, you see, I-I...

05:15.349 --> 05:17.149
you were supposed
to say the name...

05:17.151 --> 05:19.785
right... first
and then open the envelope,

05:19.787 --> 05:22.087
read "Grinder rests,"
and then be burned by that.

05:22.089 --> 05:23.369
Yeah, that would've been better.

05:25.359 --> 05:27.592
Why did you destroy
this office?!

05:27.594 --> 05:28.760
Who are you working with?!

05:30.364 --> 05:32.364
Uh, Dean, I didn't pan over,

05:32.366 --> 05:34.866
so you sort of
flew out of frame.

05:34.868 --> 05:35.834
I-I don't know.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.135
Do you mind doing it again?

05:37.137 --> 05:38.470
Sure.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.339
TODD: Sorry.

05:40.341 --> 05:42.207
DEAN: <i>"Are you sure?"</i>

05:42.209 --> 05:45.377
"I'm never not sure."

05:45.379 --> 05:46.878
"Okay."

05:46.880 --> 05:49.381
"I love you, Mitch.
There. I said it."

05:49.383 --> 05:51.950
"What we had was special,
but now

05:51.952 --> 05:53.552
"I'm in a committed
relationship,

05:53.554 --> 05:55.220
and I need you to respect that."

05:55.222 --> 05:58.690
"What's her name?"
"Her name is Lady Justice."

05:58.692 --> 06:01.326
I can't believe you're
not reading for this, man.

06:01.328 --> 06:02.728
This feels like you.

06:02.730 --> 06:04.529
No. Bro, it's you.

06:04.531 --> 06:07.399
I mean...
my acting days are over.

06:07.401 --> 06:08.700
The character though.

06:08.702 --> 06:09.868
I mean,

06:09.870 --> 06:12.471
I say the lines and, like,

06:12.473 --> 06:14.873
all I hear is you.
And look here, man.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.843
"Mitch's chiseled features
are handsome,

06:17.845 --> 06:19.177
almost beautiful."

06:19.179 --> 06:20.579
That's you, dawg.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.214
There's a lot of handsome men,
Benji.

06:22.216 --> 06:23.849
Say this line for me. I just...

06:23.851 --> 06:26.411
I just want to
hear how you do it.

06:27.221 --> 06:28.887
(clears throat)

06:30.657 --> 06:33.525
"Everybody dies.

06:33.527 --> 06:35.560
"But what if they didn't?

06:35.562 --> 06:38.363
Those are the questions
that we..."

06:38.365 --> 06:40.599
I-I can't do this. I'm sorry.

06:40.601 --> 06:45.003
I made a promise to someone,
and I intend to live up to it.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.875
(exhales)

06:49.877 --> 06:52.844
I-I couldn't do it.

06:52.846 --> 06:55.447
It's like... I forgot how.

06:55.449 --> 06:57.616
How to... grind? Is that what...

06:57.618 --> 07:00.419
Yeah, Mom. I mean, he was The
Grinder, and then he had to put

07:00.421 --> 07:02.721
all of that behind him, and
now he's trying to get it back.

07:02.723 --> 07:05.590
Yeah, and, I mean, it-it's hard.
What are you not understanding?

07:05.592 --> 07:07.359
Okay, yeah, that's on me. Sorry.

07:07.361 --> 07:08.727
You went in blind, Dean.

07:08.729 --> 07:11.129
You were relying on a bluff
without any facts.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.131
So you're saying I should
get the facts and<i> then</i> bluff?

07:13.133 --> 07:15.200
I'm saying you wouldn't need
to bluff if you had the facts.

07:15.202 --> 07:17.235
No, there's always a bluff,
regardless of the facts.

07:17.237 --> 07:19.638
Well, we have one fact and
that is there was a break-in.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.139
Right. So maybe you should
focus on that.

07:21.141 --> 07:22.641
Well...
So, it's all hands on deck,

07:22.643 --> 07:24.543
trying to figure out
who broke into the firm.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.077
Is that what we're saying?
I'm not.

07:26.079 --> 07:27.412
That's exactly right, Ethan.

07:27.414 --> 07:30.115
From now on,
I'm not gonna rest until

07:30.117 --> 07:31.716
whoever's responsible for this

07:31.718 --> 07:34.486
is brought to justice...
With facts.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.254
And bluffs.

07:36.256 --> 07:38.957
Great. Great.

07:38.959 --> 07:42.027
This, uh,
sounds like a perfect plan.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.266
He's gonna solve it.

07:48.268 --> 07:50.335
I've never seen him
so focused on something.

07:50.337 --> 07:52.571
Yeah.
We're gonna help him solve it.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.172
And who would that point him to,
Stewart?

07:54.174 --> 07:55.340
We're the ones behind it.

07:55.342 --> 07:56.808
Or did you forget that? No, no.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.643
We won't let him
actually solve it.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.345
We'll make him think
that he solved it.

08:00.347 --> 08:02.647
You look... you
look so confused.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.082
This is not a difficult
concept. I don't know...

08:04.084 --> 08:06.685
No. No, this totally
makes sense.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.954
Todd, all you have to do
is follow my lead

08:08.956 --> 08:10.455
and back up my story, okay?

08:10.457 --> 08:12.257
No. No. I get... I got it.

08:12.259 --> 08:13.091
Pretty straightforward.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.626
Yeah. Uh, just...

08:14.628 --> 08:16.695
Can you shoot it to me
in an e-mail?

08:22.135 --> 08:23.468
Whoa. Claire, your office is

08:23.470 --> 08:25.670
way worse than anyone else's.
That's weird.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.005
Yeah, I thought so, too.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.540
I don't see it. DEAN:
Hey, guys, could you just

08:28.542 --> 08:29.875
keep the chatter down?
I'm working here.

08:29.877 --> 08:32.310
Oh, right. Am I in your way?
No, it's mostly them.

08:32.312 --> 08:34.145
Uh, Dean, we were actually
just coming to look for you.

08:34.147 --> 08:35.780
Uh, Todd and I were
talking about the case.

08:35.782 --> 08:37.782
We were? We were. Remember?
Like, a second ago.

08:37.784 --> 08:40.385
We were, uh, talking about
this homeless guy that we saw.

08:40.387 --> 08:41.353
Remember?

08:41.355 --> 08:42.854
We-we both saw him out back.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.056
He was?
I haven't seen him in forever.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.491
Oh, no. He's been
around a lot lately.

08:46.493 --> 08:48.994
Yeah. Kind of just around the
time of the break-in, really,

08:48.996 --> 08:51.396
don't-don't you think, Todd? I-I
can't speak to the timing of it.

08:51.398 --> 08:52.898
Oh, my God. Okay.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.566
I'm just... I'm just saying, uh,

08:54.568 --> 08:56.568
I-I think we should take a look.

08:56.570 --> 08:57.903
No, I don't think
that he would do this.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.170
He's always been so nice.

08:59.172 --> 09:01.339
Guys...

09:01.341 --> 09:03.408
here are the facts.

09:03.410 --> 09:07.045
The hamburger wrappers tell us
the perp is a disgusting slob.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.580
Huh. He targeted Claire,

09:08.582 --> 09:09.881
which tells us he has something

09:09.883 --> 09:11.550
weird and unhinged with women.

09:11.552 --> 09:13.151
This guy does not get laid.

09:13.153 --> 09:16.154
Uh... are we sure about that?

09:16.156 --> 09:17.522
All right,
here's what's gonna happen.

09:17.524 --> 09:19.658
Todd, you're gonna go put on
a fresh pot of coffee,

09:19.660 --> 09:20.692
On it. And you are gonna

09:20.694 --> 09:22.193
walk me through
every single exchange

09:22.195 --> 09:23.562
you've ever had with this guy.

09:23.564 --> 09:25.530
Okay.
Maybe not in my office though.

09:25.532 --> 09:27.252
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

09:29.836 --> 09:30.835
Oh.

09:30.837 --> 09:32.571
Where were you?

09:32.573 --> 09:35.340
I was with Benji.

09:35.342 --> 09:36.541
Doing what?

09:36.543 --> 09:39.077
Just... helping him.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.046
You've been acting, haven't you?

09:41.048 --> 09:42.547
I wouldn't say "acting."

09:42.549 --> 09:44.616
Were you helping Benji
with his lines?

09:44.618 --> 09:45.450
A few.

09:45.452 --> 09:48.019
A few lines or an entire scene?

09:48.021 --> 09:50.121
Look, he needs to book
this gig, okay?

09:50.123 --> 09:51.623
If he doesn't, he has to

09:51.625 --> 09:53.191
dip into his grandmother's
trust fund.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.460
Damn it, Dean, we talked about this!
I know, b-but, listen...

09:55.462 --> 09:56.795
Do you even care
about this interview at all?

09:56.797 --> 09:58.463
Yes. No, I-I swear to you
that I am done acting!

09:58.465 --> 10:00.298
Okay, because if you did,
then you would've been preparing

10:00.300 --> 10:02.300
for that instead of working
on some stupid audition!

10:02.302 --> 10:03.635
No, I swear. I'm done acting.

10:03.637 --> 10:05.604
I swear. I'm absolutely done.
It's over.

10:05.606 --> 10:07.772
When you go in
to sit down with my father,

10:07.774 --> 10:09.140
he is gonna ask you,
point-blank,

10:09.142 --> 10:12.877
are you an actor or are you
a freezer door salesman?

10:12.879 --> 10:14.145
I'm gonna tell him the truth.

10:14.147 --> 10:17.816
Freezer doors is who... I am!

10:26.326 --> 10:28.226
Deb.

10:28.228 --> 10:31.563
Hmm. Huh? Hmm? Debbie. Deb. Deb.

10:31.565 --> 10:33.665
What? What? Why are you doing that to me?
Deb, I... I want...

10:33.667 --> 10:34.899
I got to tell you something.
What?

10:34.901 --> 10:35.900
I ransacked the office.

10:35.902 --> 10:38.003
What?

10:38.005 --> 10:39.304
Well, I mean, Todd
actually did it,

10:39.306 --> 10:40.972
but I was the one
that told him to.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.173
Stewart, why would you do that?

10:42.175 --> 10:44.075
I-I just organized
that whole place.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.677
Dean cannot find out about this.

10:45.679 --> 10:47.012
Dean can't find out about...

10:47.014 --> 10:48.346
That's what you're worried about?
Mm. Yeah.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.281
Not even, like, a sorry or anything?
I am sorry.

10:50.283 --> 10:52.784
Are you? Yeah. I'm sorry. I feel
very bad about it, but could we just

10:52.786 --> 10:55.253
push past my feelings right now?
We got to focus on the break-in.

10:55.255 --> 10:58.923
Oh. Oh, you want Dean
to solve the break-in,

10:58.925 --> 11:01.526
and so that's why you keep
pushing this homeless guy stuff.

11:01.528 --> 11:03.028
I'm walking a very
fine line here, Debbie.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.496
Very little margin for error.

11:04.498 --> 11:06.598
And you only have Todd
on your side.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.701
Good luck with that.

11:09.703 --> 11:11.803
Are we done talking about this?
Mm-hmm.

11:11.805 --> 11:14.365
Well, I don't feel
better at all now.

11:15.876 --> 11:18.209
Hey, man. I got your message.

11:18.211 --> 11:20.211
But, listen,
my old lady's really on my ass.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.180
I'm not even supposed
to be here. So what's up?

11:22.182 --> 11:24.049
You're not gonna
believe this, man.

11:24.051 --> 11:25.283
You know that chick Rachel...

11:25.285 --> 11:26.618
The assistant casting chick

11:26.620 --> 11:28.453
I've been boning
the last few weeks?

11:28.455 --> 11:29.954
Yeah, what about her?

11:29.956 --> 11:32.724
Well, out of nowhere,
she goes dark on me.

11:32.726 --> 11:34.659
Couldn't get any feedback
on that audition

11:34.661 --> 11:36.561
from that show
I was telling you about.

11:36.563 --> 11:38.196
What,<i> The Grinder?</i> Yeah.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.998
So, turns out,
they're changing the part

11:40.000 --> 11:42.701
of Mitch Grinder into a woman.

11:42.703 --> 11:44.002
What? Yeah.

11:44.004 --> 11:45.837
Damn it, what is wrong
with this business?

11:45.839 --> 11:47.639
Every good part goes to a woman.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.842
It's just not fair, Benji.

11:50.844 --> 11:53.511
They read every actor
between the age

11:53.513 --> 11:56.514
of 18 and 60.

11:56.516 --> 11:58.583
Everybody in L.A.,

11:58.585 --> 12:02.187
New York, Chicago,

12:02.189 --> 12:06.357
London, Orlando,

12:06.359 --> 12:08.919
but they couldn't find him.

12:10.363 --> 12:13.732
Well, why are you
telling me this?

12:13.734 --> 12:16.601
I don't know.

12:16.603 --> 12:19.838
I just thought you might
find it interesting, is all.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.015
So these are doorknobs
from the office?

12:31.017 --> 12:32.417
Stew! That's evidence.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.552
Oh, my God, Dad.
Oh, I'm so sorry, I almost...

12:34.554 --> 12:36.554
Tampered with the evidence.
Yeah, what an idiot.

12:36.556 --> 12:38.022
Guys, why don't you
bring him up to speed here.

12:38.024 --> 12:39.457
Okay, so this is what we know.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.192
Each of these doorknobs
have been tampered with.

12:41.194 --> 12:43.628
Yeah, but none of them show
any signs of forced entry.

12:43.630 --> 12:44.629
Which means, Deb?

12:44.631 --> 12:47.232
That it was an inside job.

12:47.234 --> 12:48.933
And your homeless guy
theory is out the window.

12:48.935 --> 12:51.703
What? That... That's ridiculous.
Is it?

12:51.705 --> 12:53.938
Stewart, I understand
you're scared.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.240
So am I.

12:55.242 --> 12:56.908
Because it means
someone we know...

12:56.910 --> 12:59.110
Someone we trust... did this.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.412
And I'm not gonna rest
until I bring that person

13:01.414 --> 13:02.714
to justice. Justice.

13:02.716 --> 13:04.783
Right.
Yeah, you always say that.

13:04.785 --> 13:06.284
Because it's always applicable.

13:08.622 --> 13:11.256
So, Dean, what's the
quitting acting all about?

13:11.258 --> 13:13.658
Well, Kelly says if I don't
quit, she'll leave me.

13:13.660 --> 13:14.826
It's adorable.

13:14.828 --> 13:16.294
Is it? Is that adorable?

13:16.296 --> 13:19.063
You know, I can't tell you
how good it is to have someone

13:19.065 --> 13:21.666
who just wants to jump
right into that captain's seat

13:21.668 --> 13:23.434
and take charge. There are times

13:23.436 --> 13:26.404
when I have an idea... she
doesn't even want to hear it.

13:26.406 --> 13:27.906
She's the best. Well, Deb and I

13:27.908 --> 13:31.409
just want to make sure that
you're leaving acting because

13:31.411 --> 13:32.644
<i>you</i> want to. Mm-hmm.

13:32.646 --> 13:34.946
I want to do
what Kelly wants to do.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.414
It's best for everyone.

13:36.416 --> 13:38.183
But long-term though, is it?

13:38.185 --> 13:40.185
Yeah, I mean, don't...
don't you owe it to yourself

13:40.187 --> 13:41.519
and to Kelly to-to make up

13:41.521 --> 13:42.821
your own mind?

13:42.823 --> 13:44.789
(sighs) Yeah.

13:44.791 --> 13:47.258
No, uh... I guess.

13:47.260 --> 13:50.428
We just want you to feel
like you gave it your all.

13:50.430 --> 13:51.863
No regrets.

13:53.834 --> 13:56.100
Do either of you
believe in destiny?

13:56.102 --> 13:59.704
Uh, yeah, I... I do.
Uh, yeah, sure, I guess.

13:59.706 --> 14:01.539
They couldn't find him.

14:01.541 --> 14:02.621
Who?

14:03.476 --> 14:05.210
The Grinder.

14:05.212 --> 14:07.111
Do you remember that show
I told you about?

14:07.113 --> 14:09.280
Oh, hey, everybody.

14:09.282 --> 14:10.381
Hey. Hi.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.350
Sweetie, that's not
what you're wearing

14:12.352 --> 14:13.384
to your meeting Daddy, is it?

14:13.386 --> 14:15.520
No, it's not.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.488
Because I'm not
meeting with Daddy.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.290
Um... you know what?

14:19.292 --> 14:21.626
We should be leaving. If
we're gonna go... Yeah.

14:21.628 --> 14:22.794
Make it to that... Mm-hmm.

14:22.796 --> 14:24.028
Going... Shh. Shh, shh,

14:24.030 --> 14:25.530
shh, shh.

14:25.532 --> 14:28.266
What do you mean?
My brother believes in me.

14:29.636 --> 14:31.703
And I'm starting to think
that he's the only one.

14:31.705 --> 14:34.706
Well, no, I also was just saying
that I believe... Deb does.

14:34.708 --> 14:37.308
What's going on, Pooper?
I'm not Pooper!

14:37.310 --> 14:39.978
And I'm also not a
freezer door salesman.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.246
If you go back to acting...

14:41.248 --> 14:42.714
I know. I...

14:42.716 --> 14:44.716
I wish it didn't have
to end like this

14:44.718 --> 14:46.885
and that I could be
who you want me to be.

14:46.887 --> 14:49.053
Because you are awesome,
and you deserve a man

14:49.055 --> 14:51.615
who's incapable of making
decisions for himself.

14:52.559 --> 14:53.725
I want that for you.

14:53.727 --> 14:56.694
You really think
you're gonna be a superstar?

14:56.696 --> 14:57.829
(laughs)

14:58.698 --> 15:00.698
Good luck with that.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.600
I'll be whatever I want to be!

15:02.602 --> 15:05.603
You'll see.

15:05.605 --> 15:08.239
All right, everybody,
phones in the box.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.041
Uh, I'm sorry, Dean,
why are we doing this?

15:10.043 --> 15:11.609
I'm gonna be taking statements
regarding everybody's

15:11.611 --> 15:13.578
whereabouts on the night
of the break-in.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.680
All right, well, I got nothing to hide.
Yeah, me neither.

15:15.682 --> 15:18.716
Uh, yeah, me neither.
Uh, totally clean over here.

15:18.718 --> 15:21.519
Stew? I'm not giving you
my cell phone, Dean.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.254
Stew, do you know who takes
his shoes off at the airport?

15:23.256 --> 15:26.357
Brian Austin Green.
Is he a terrorist?

15:26.359 --> 15:27.759
No. But he does it
because it sends

15:27.761 --> 15:31.296
an important message
that no one is above suspicion.

15:31.298 --> 15:34.365
Well, you make
a compelling argument.

15:40.206 --> 15:41.639
Good day, sir.

15:41.641 --> 15:44.475
Uh, I'm here to repair
Mr. Alan Thicke's Maserati.

15:44.477 --> 15:46.077
I'm Chip. I'm his auto mechanic.

15:46.079 --> 15:47.645
I don't see anything
in the computer about it.

15:47.647 --> 15:48.646
What was your name again?

15:48.648 --> 15:50.114
Chip. Chip Lubbock.

15:50.116 --> 15:51.249
Oh, you from Lubbock, Texas?

15:51.251 --> 15:52.450
Galveston, actually.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.818
Get out of here, man.

15:53.820 --> 15:55.286
Born and raised.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.121
What was your high school?
Victorville.

15:57.123 --> 15:59.457
No way. You play ball?

15:59.459 --> 16:00.658
I did, I did.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.660
A little special teams,
a little DB.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.729
Who was your coach?
Coach McCandless.

16:04.731 --> 16:07.432
And I'm guessing
you played for Coach Cordle.

16:07.434 --> 16:08.933
You're good.

16:08.935 --> 16:11.169
I haven't been good
since my daddy was killed

16:11.171 --> 16:14.772
in a massive explosion
on an oil rig in the gulf.

16:14.774 --> 16:17.108
Whoa. I'm sorry to hear that.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.843
Don't be.

16:18.845 --> 16:21.879
It's these details
that build character.

16:28.755 --> 16:32.423
¶ ¶

16:43.703 --> 16:46.971
Where were you on March 13?
At my house.

16:46.973 --> 16:48.606
(echoing):
The hours of 7:00 p.m.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.008
Where you on the night
of March 13?

16:50.010 --> 16:51.442
I was at home.

16:51.444 --> 16:52.877
<i>Inside job.</i>
Tell me what really happened.

16:52.879 --> 16:54.445
You were at the grocery store?

16:54.447 --> 16:55.980
I was at
the Boise Garden Suites...

16:55.982 --> 16:57.715
I was with Claire all night.

16:57.717 --> 16:59.817
At the Boise Garden Suites?
I've already said too much.

16:59.819 --> 17:02.120
Where were you?! I remind you,
sir, you are under oath.

17:02.122 --> 17:04.288
How would I know where I was?
Aha!

17:04.290 --> 17:05.456
<i>I want the truth!</i>

17:05.458 --> 17:07.358
Where were you on March 13
from the hours of...

17:07.360 --> 17:10.428
(echoing): <i>It was an inside job.</i>

17:12.565 --> 17:14.132
(sighs)

17:14.134 --> 17:15.833
So are you satisfied, Dean?

17:15.835 --> 17:17.468
Can I get my phone back now,
please?

17:17.470 --> 17:19.904
Take it. Take 'em all.

17:19.906 --> 17:22.373
Uh, no, just... just need mine.

17:23.910 --> 17:26.511
What do you do
when you have forgotten

17:26.513 --> 17:30.248
<i>how</i> to do the one thing

17:30.250 --> 17:32.016
that you were born to do?

17:32.018 --> 17:34.218
Well, you know, Dean,
these, um...

17:34.220 --> 17:36.054
these things take time.

17:36.056 --> 17:37.755
I mean, I asked
all the right questions,

17:37.757 --> 17:39.424
I followed all the right leads,

17:39.426 --> 17:41.893
and we're no closer
to finding out who did this.

17:41.895 --> 17:44.695
Uh, well, you know, uh,
hang on a second there.

17:44.697 --> 17:45.997
Uh, didn't someone

17:45.999 --> 17:47.065
jump out at you?

17:47.067 --> 17:48.666
Uh, Todd maybe?

17:48.668 --> 17:51.202
Well, there was one thing
that was weird with Todd.

17:51.204 --> 17:52.437
But Todd didn't do this.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.338
Todd didn't destroy the office.

17:54.340 --> 17:55.606
Did he not?

17:55.608 --> 17:57.675
I mean, do we really know that?

17:57.677 --> 17:59.877
You think he's capable of...?

17:59.879 --> 18:04.715
I don't know what
Todd is capable of, Dean.

18:04.717 --> 18:07.452
Okay, I need a minute
to take that in.

18:07.454 --> 18:08.786
Yeah? That's a lot.

18:08.788 --> 18:11.022
You know, I'm just
gonna take a walk.

18:14.761 --> 18:17.261
What happened? We good?

18:17.263 --> 18:19.597
No, Todd, we are not good.
We're not good?

18:19.599 --> 18:21.265
I don't know what you said,
but he's onto you.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.101
Damn it! I pushed it too far.

18:23.103 --> 18:25.570
My alibi with Claire...
I just pushed it too far!

18:25.572 --> 18:28.406
That's what it was. You
pushed the alibi. Oh.

18:28.408 --> 18:31.409
Well, look, we tried, but
it's time for you to own it now.

18:31.411 --> 18:33.644
Okay, you got to take one
for the team, Todd. Oh.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.546
I have to? You got to do it.

18:35.548 --> 18:36.914
Hey. I'm sorry, Stew.

18:36.916 --> 18:38.549
I forgot my phone.
Could you just grab it for me?

18:38.551 --> 18:40.451
Oh, uh, yeah, sure.

18:40.453 --> 18:41.486
Here you go.

18:41.488 --> 18:42.987
Oh, look at this.

18:42.989 --> 18:44.555
It was recording...

18:44.557 --> 18:46.290
(gasps) ...this whole time.

18:46.292 --> 18:47.558
Oh.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.060
Should we listen to it?

18:49.062 --> 18:50.528
Mm...

18:55.268 --> 18:56.601
No. Don't.

18:56.603 --> 18:58.336
Dean, you don't...
you don't have to.

18:58.338 --> 18:59.303
I-I did it.

18:59.305 --> 19:00.938
Okay? It was me.

19:00.940 --> 19:03.307
I was the one who told Todd

19:03.309 --> 19:06.944
to<i> lightly</i> mess up the office.

19:06.946 --> 19:08.012
Why would you do that?

19:08.014 --> 19:09.680
We needed you.

19:09.682 --> 19:10.962
<i>I</i> needed you.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.017
We needed The Grinder.

19:13.019 --> 19:14.352
Really?

19:14.354 --> 19:15.520
How'd you know?

19:15.522 --> 19:17.522
Oh, I didn't.

19:17.524 --> 19:19.157
Phone isn't even recording.

19:19.159 --> 19:21.192
There's always a bluff.

19:21.194 --> 19:23.961
You.

19:23.963 --> 19:26.197
You, you, you, you.

19:27.267 --> 19:29.767
You are the missing piece.

19:29.769 --> 19:32.870
You are what allows me to grind.

19:33.806 --> 19:35.473
Do you remember ten years ago,

19:35.475 --> 19:38.142
when I would've been happy
to never have grinded at all,

19:38.144 --> 19:40.111
and you weren't having it?

19:41.047 --> 19:42.847
Do you remember
what you said to me?

19:42.849 --> 19:45.149
I'm-I'm blanking, so...
You told me

19:45.151 --> 19:46.951
to find my destiny.

19:49.222 --> 19:52.823
And find it, I did.

19:52.825 --> 19:54.759
Hmm.

19:56.629 --> 20:00.231
A woman like you
needs protection.

20:00.233 --> 20:02.633
I see you like my brassiere.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.835
Here, you can have it.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.404
Because the only support I need

20:06.406 --> 20:08.573
is the United States
Constitution.

20:08.575 --> 20:10.508
Stop!

20:10.510 --> 20:11.742
What the hell is this?

20:11.744 --> 20:13.811
We are in the middle of
a casting session, sir,

20:13.813 --> 20:15.479
for a television pilot!

20:15.481 --> 20:16.514
This is wrong.

20:16.516 --> 20:17.582
How did he get on the lot?

20:17.584 --> 20:19.750
As an actor,

20:19.752 --> 20:22.420
we all just want the same thing.

20:22.422 --> 20:24.255
A fair shot.

20:24.257 --> 20:25.890
An honest look

20:25.892 --> 20:27.191
for an honest effort.

20:27.193 --> 20:28.492
Jeff, call security.

20:28.494 --> 20:29.774
Hang on, Jeff.

20:34.601 --> 20:37.635
It's not my fault
that I was born a man.

20:39.172 --> 20:40.838
That's my cross to bear.

20:41.841 --> 20:43.374
And mine alone.

20:43.376 --> 20:44.709
But when Hollywood

20:44.711 --> 20:50.581
insists on giving
all of the best parts to women,

20:50.583 --> 20:53.951
it is my duty, my obligation

20:53.953 --> 20:56.921
to rectify that injustice

20:56.923 --> 21:00.258
and give voice to the voiceless.

21:00.260 --> 21:01.626
And to say

21:01.628 --> 21:05.863
shame... on... you.

21:06.899 --> 21:08.132
Mitchard Grinder

21:08.134 --> 21:09.634
is a man.

21:09.636 --> 21:14.038
A strong, proud<i> man.</i>

21:17.243 --> 21:19.744
And I am that man.

21:19.746 --> 21:23.914
You think the character's name
is<i> Mitchard</i> Grinder?

21:23.916 --> 21:26.617
Well, yeah. What-what else
would "Mitch" be short for?

21:26.619 --> 21:28.286
Mitchell?

21:28.288 --> 21:29.720
Who are you?

21:29.722 --> 21:32.123
I'm the one
you've been looking for.

21:32.125 --> 21:35.926
I'm Cliff Bemis, show creator.

21:35.928 --> 21:37.962
It's a pleasure to meet you...

21:37.964 --> 21:41.332
Sanderson. Dean Sanderson.

That's awesome.
