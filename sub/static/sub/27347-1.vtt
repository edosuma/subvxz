02:05.917 --> 02:08.752
They told me you were dead.

02:08.752 --> 02:10.463
I knew you weren't.

02:12.924 --> 02:14.801
How long has it been?

02:17.846 --> 02:19.180
- I'm not sure.

02:20.265 --> 02:22.642
- Well, we were just girls.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.813
It seems like yesterday.

02:54.382 --> 02:56.718
(thunder rumbling)

02:56.718 --> 02:59.304
- I wanna show you something.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.897
This is my favorite thing.

03:20.533 --> 03:22.535

03:23.620 --> 03:25.914

03:25.914 --> 03:29.250
- True. (laughing)

03:42.805 --> 03:44.766
- [Nurse] We usually askthat visitors sign in

03:44.766 --> 03:46.392
at the front desk.

03:46.392 --> 03:47.936
- She doesn't have to sign in.

03:47.936 --> 03:49.103
She's family.

03:50.271 --> 03:54.359
- I only have Margaret and Jenon your visitor list, Rose.

03:55.109 --> 03:57.236
- Oh, for heaven's sakes,

03:57.236 --> 03:59.530
she is my big sister Abby.

04:00.823 --> 04:04.118
Can't you see thefamily resemblance?

04:06.537 --> 04:08.581
- [Nurse] What's your name?

04:08.581 --> 04:11.209

04:35.400 --> 04:37.402
(thunder rumbling)

04:37.402 --> 04:38.403
- [Maggie] No.

04:38.403 --> 04:39.529

This is your Great Aunt Abby.

(gentle instrumental music)

04:52.250 --> 04:53.126
Tell them, Abby.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.335

04:54.335 --> 04:55.128
Thank you.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.004
Come on, young lady.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.255
It's time to go.

04:57.255 --> 04:58.381
- [Rose] She's tired.

04:58.381 --> 05:01.342
She needs clean clothesand a place to sleep.

05:01.342 --> 05:03.428
You have a guest bedroom.

05:03.428 --> 05:04.512
- Grandma--

05:04.512 --> 05:05.555
- We need to figureout where she came from

05:05.555 --> 05:07.181
and if anyone islooking for her.

05:07.181 --> 05:09.017
- No one is looking for me.

05:09.017 --> 05:10.268
- [Rose] Maggie.

05:10.268 --> 05:12.478
- You don't evenknow who she is.

05:12.478 --> 05:14.105
- Margaret.

05:14.105 --> 05:16.149
(thunder rumbling)

05:16.149 --> 05:18.985
Some things simplycannot be explained

05:18.985 --> 05:20.236
all in a rush.

05:21.946 --> 05:22.989
Now please.

05:25.033 --> 05:25.950
- When we last spoke,

05:25.950 --> 05:27.076
and granted it was a while ago,

05:27.076 --> 05:28.953
Michael had mentionedthat you might have room

05:28.953 --> 05:31.080
for an additional child.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.043
- Did he?

05:35.043 --> 05:35.877
- [Carol] It's late.

05:35.877 --> 05:36.961
The office is closed.

05:36.961 --> 05:40.214
What if you take herhome just for the night?

05:40.214 --> 05:41.382
- I don't know, Carol.

05:41.382 --> 05:42.759
- She can't stay here.

- I'll come backas soon as I can.

06:27.095 --> 06:30.890
(gentle instrumental music)

06:37.438 --> 06:40.149
(rain falling)

06:44.320 --> 06:46.322
Sometimes life grabs us

06:46.322 --> 06:48.699
and pulls us to places unknown.

06:48.699 --> 06:51.369
(rain falling)

06:52.286 --> 06:54.539
All we can do is hopethat where we end up

06:54.539 --> 06:57.750
is better than whatwe leave behind.

07:00.795 --> 07:01.921
There you are.

07:01.921 --> 07:03.464
(rain falling)

07:03.464 --> 07:07.260

07:50.970 --> 07:53.681
- [Maggie] Jen, this is Abby.

07:53.681 --> 07:56.434

07:56.434 --> 07:59.645
- Show Abby to theguest room, okay?

08:00.813 --> 08:01.731
- Come on.

08:04.775 --> 08:06.319
- It's okay.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.987
It's just upstairs.

08:07.987 --> 08:09.113
Get settled in,

08:09.113 --> 08:11.199

08:18.706 --> 08:22.502
(gentle instrumental music)

08:43.356 --> 08:44.815
- Was that your cat?

08:44.815 --> 08:46.859
- Nothing here is mine.

08:52.823 --> 08:55.243
- Hey, she's juststaying tonight.

08:55.243 --> 08:58.079
She had nowhere else to go.

08:58.079 --> 09:00.248
Hey, it's a school night.

09:00.248 --> 09:03.209
(thunder rumbling)

09:06.587 --> 09:09.173
A bathroom is down the hall,

09:09.173 --> 09:12.385

10:06.814 --> 10:09.442

10:19.577 --> 10:21.370
I like your lantern.

10:22.621 --> 10:24.332
Looks like Gizmo does too.

10:24.332 --> 10:27.084
(laughing)

10:27.084 --> 10:28.002
Peter Pan?

10:29.170 --> 10:31.339
Oh, I love that book.

10:31.339 --> 10:33.841
Looks like it's areally old copy.

10:33.841 --> 10:35.968
- Yeah, it's the oldest.

10:38.054 --> 10:40.139
- [Maggie] You gettingsettled in okay?

10:40.139 --> 10:41.015
- Yes.

10:42.767 --> 10:45.978

11:10.878 --> 11:12.088

almost exactly.

11:15.883 --> 11:17.593
- [Abby] I'm sorry.

11:20.262 --> 11:21.347
- Thank you.

11:24.433 --> 11:26.310
- [Abby] You still wear it.

11:29.563 --> 11:32.566
Everything happens for a reason,

11:32.566 --> 11:33.984
don't you think?

11:39.115 --> 11:42.326
- Gizmo never letsanyone touch her.

11:44.412 --> 11:45.955
What's your name?

11:47.289 --> 11:48.791
What's your real name?

11:48.791 --> 11:51.711
My grandmother, she getsthings confused sometimes and--

12:08.644 --> 12:11.605
- Honey, what areyou talking about?

12:11.605 --> 12:15.651

12:56.484 --> 12:59.278
(phone ringing)

13:02.323 --> 13:03.324
- [Jen] Hey, it's Jen.

13:03.324 --> 13:04.617
I'm not around.

13:05.701 --> 13:07.161
(electronic beeping)

13:07.161 --> 13:09.413
- Jen, it's 2:00 in the morning.

13:09.413 --> 13:10.664
Where are you?

13:12.458 --> 13:13.292
Don't do this to me.

13:13.292 --> 13:15.252
It scares me to death.

13:50.579 --> 13:53.666
(thunder rumbling)

14:01.465 --> 14:03.884
(murmuring)

14:28.951 --> 14:32.371
I'll be back after my morningclasses to check on you.

14:32.371 --> 14:33.414
- I'll be fine.

14:33.414 --> 14:34.957
I like libraries.

14:41.964 --> 14:45.801
(gentle instrumental music)

15:02.818 --> 15:05.237
(murmuring)

15:06.196 --> 15:09.408

15:35.267 --> 15:37.144
(murmuring)

15:37.144 --> 15:40.981
(gentle instrumental music)

15:44.693 --> 15:46.195
- [Abby] Sometimes Ifeel like I'm sitting

15:46.195 --> 15:48.489
beside a rushing river.

15:48.489 --> 15:49.990
I try to dip my feet in,

15:49.990 --> 15:52.284
but the tide is so strong,

15:52.284 --> 15:54.036
I'm afraid I'll be carried away.

15:54.036 --> 15:57.873
(gentle instrumental music)

16:15.516 --> 16:19.395
(indistinct classroom noise)

16:20.312 --> 16:23.732
(a guitar playsfrom down the hall)

16:27.194 --> 16:30.197

17:08.986 --> 17:10.362

- How do you know Maggie?

17:13.281 --> 17:16.617
- [Abby] She's lookingafter me today.

17:16.617 --> 17:20.204

17:43.103 --> 17:45.773

- I've had a few lessons,

17:46.815 --> 17:49.985
but that was areally long time ago.

17:56.033 --> 17:58.118
(laughing)

17:58.118 --> 18:01.121
- Alright, show mewhat you got, kid.

18:01.121 --> 18:02.289
Wow.

18:02.289 --> 18:04.333
(guitar playing)

18:04.333 --> 18:06.627
Not bad, I think Ican work with that.

18:06.627 --> 18:08.796

18:08.796 --> 18:09.963
(bell ringing)

Oh, there's thebell, saved by it.

18:12.216 --> 18:15.886
Have a great day (murmuring).

18:18.931 --> 18:20.307
- You just have tostretch your fingers

18:20.307 --> 18:22.267
all the way right there.

18:22.267 --> 18:23.477
(guitar strum)

18:23.477 --> 18:25.270
(laughing)

18:25.270 --> 18:27.689
(footsteps)

- Okay.

18:49.711 --> 18:52.339
- Thank you for keepingan eye on her for me.

18:52.339 --> 18:54.174
- Not for you,

18:54.174 --> 18:55.676
she wandered in here.

18:55.676 --> 18:56.844
- [Maggie] Fine.

18:56.844 --> 18:58.554
- Maybe she gottired of waiting.

18:58.554 --> 18:59.471
- John.

19:00.430 --> 19:03.851
- [John] I gottaget ready for class.

19:03.851 --> 19:05.352
- Abby, come on.

19:05.352 --> 19:07.312
- See you around, kid.

19:08.897 --> 19:12.151
(instrument chiming)

19:23.871 --> 19:27.833
- Did you know that Mr. Griffinteaches private lessons?

19:27.833 --> 19:29.877
- Yes, I did know that.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.885
- Where are we going?

19:40.679 --> 19:43.223
- To talk with a social worker.

19:43.223 --> 19:45.517
- So you're trading me in.

19:47.394 --> 19:49.688
(Jen humming)

19:51.064 --> 19:54.234
(car engine running)

19:58.238 --> 20:01.116
(metal clanging)

20:05.871 --> 20:07.706
- Hi, Sam, I'm runninga few minutes late.

20:07.706 --> 20:10.000
You can wait in my office.

20:13.253 --> 20:15.756
Maggie, we can step in here.

20:23.263 --> 20:25.182
So here's the situation.

20:25.182 --> 20:26.934
There's no record ofher in the system.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.101
I have nowhere to place her

20:28.101 --> 20:31.521
until I find a morepermanent solution.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.442
I know that you brought her here

20:35.442 --> 20:37.319
because you were planningto bring her back,

20:37.319 --> 20:39.488
but I'm gonna ask youto keep her just a few

20:39.488 --> 20:41.615
more days until I finda more permanent home.

20:41.615 --> 20:43.867
I know it's morethan you asked for.

20:43.867 --> 20:45.452
I think it's what'sbest for her,

20:45.452 --> 20:47.287
just a few more days.

21:18.402 --> 21:20.988
- Would you like to staywith us for a while?

21:20.988 --> 21:22.239
- Really?

21:22.239 --> 21:24.616
- Yeah, I mean, onlyfor a little while

21:24.616 --> 21:27.703
until Carol gets things sorted.

21:27.703 --> 21:30.414
- [Abby] Yes, I would.

21:30.414 --> 21:31.581
- Okay, good.

21:32.499 --> 21:34.167
We'll just have to,

21:34.167 --> 21:35.627
we'll schedule afollow up appointment

21:35.627 --> 21:37.713
with one of their doctors.

21:37.713 --> 21:38.630
- But why?

21:39.506 --> 21:42.467
- [Maggie] Oh, standardprocedure, I think.

21:42.467 --> 21:43.719
- I don't need to go.

21:43.719 --> 21:44.636
I'm fine.

21:45.554 --> 21:48.223
- Well, it isn't up to me, so,

21:49.141 --> 21:52.477
it's nothing to beworried about, I'm sure.

21:58.650 --> 22:01.153
Stay here for a minute, okay?

22:13.707 --> 22:15.292
- Are you serious?

22:16.793 --> 22:18.837
- You would prefer Ijust leave her here

22:18.837 --> 22:20.380
to be put back into the system

22:20.380 --> 22:22.382
like you were forall those years?

22:22.382 --> 22:23.300
- It's not even like that.

22:23.300 --> 22:25.594
It's like you don't even ask me.

22:25.594 --> 22:27.721
You don't even tell mewhat you're going to do.

22:27.721 --> 22:29.056
You just do it.

22:29.056 --> 22:32.059
- Okay, I don't have torun things past you, Jen.

22:32.059 --> 22:33.894
- Michael adopted me.

22:33.894 --> 22:35.187
I'm a Stevens too.

22:35.187 --> 22:36.897
Does that mean anything to you?

22:36.897 --> 22:38.273
- We adopted you.

22:38.273 --> 22:41.151
- Okay, if that's whatyou need to tell yourself.

22:41.151 --> 22:44.029
- And what is thatsupposed to mean?

22:44.029 --> 22:45.447
- Forget it.

22:45.447 --> 22:46.365
- What?

22:48.075 --> 22:50.035
- [Jen] We don't needto add another member

22:50.035 --> 22:52.871
to this screwed up family, okay?

22:54.873 --> 22:57.918
- What do you want from me, Jen?

22:57.918 --> 22:59.377
- Nothing.

22:59.377 --> 23:03.757
Honestly, I wish Michaelwere here instead of you.

23:45.632 --> 23:46.800
- You hungry?

23:58.019 --> 24:00.897
- I didn't mean tocause problems for you.

24:00.897 --> 24:01.815
- Oh, no.

24:02.899 --> 24:04.276
No, you didn't.

24:05.485 --> 24:09.823
No, she and I had problemslong before you showed up.

24:13.243 --> 24:15.662
We'll figure it out though.

24:24.171 --> 24:27.215
So now that you areofficially staying with us,

24:27.215 --> 24:28.884
I thought it might be fun

24:28.884 --> 24:33.138
to set up some guitarlessons with Mr. Griffin.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.514
- Really?

24:34.514 --> 24:36.725
- Yeah, it looked like youwere having fun with it.

24:36.725 --> 24:38.018
- Yes.

24:38.018 --> 24:42.189
- Okay, and Jen, I'm gonnasign you up for lessons too.

24:43.231 --> 24:45.066
- [Jen] No thanks.

24:45.066 --> 24:47.068
- It's not optional.

24:47.068 --> 24:49.488
- I don't wannalearn the guitar.

24:49.488 --> 24:52.199
- Oh no, not guitarlessons, voice lessons.

24:52.199 --> 24:54.034
(birds chirping)

24:54.034 --> 24:54.951
- Why?

24:55.911 --> 24:58.038
- Well, you liketo sing don't you?

24:58.038 --> 25:02.375
- That doesn't mean thatI want to be a singer.

25:03.084 --> 25:05.921
- It's this or summer school,

25:05.921 --> 25:07.005
your choice.

25:13.470 --> 25:15.889
You sure this is where youwanna spend the morning?

25:15.889 --> 25:18.600
I can't promise a good time.

25:18.600 --> 25:19.726
- I'm sure.

25:19.726 --> 25:20.644
- Okay.

25:29.611 --> 25:31.696
Is she doing any better today?

25:31.696 --> 25:33.823
- Not that I can tell.

25:33.823 --> 25:36.284
Are you sure thisis a good idea?

25:36.284 --> 25:38.703
(murmuring)

25:41.081 --> 25:41.957
- [Maggie] Hi, Grandma.

25:41.957 --> 25:43.041
- Ah, hello.

25:43.750 --> 25:44.709
- [Maggie] How are you feeling?

25:44.709 --> 25:46.711
- Oh, I can't complain.

25:50.173 --> 25:51.883
- You remember Abby.

25:51.883 --> 25:54.678
- Now that is a silly question.

25:55.637 --> 25:58.390
I have somethingI wanna show you.

26:02.102 --> 26:03.770
Are you staying, Margaret?

26:03.770 --> 26:05.605
- Oh, no, I've gottarun into school

26:05.605 --> 26:07.816
and grade the kids' finals,

26:07.816 --> 26:10.777
and so I'll be a few hours.

26:10.777 --> 26:12.779
- Oh, that's fine.

26:12.779 --> 26:14.823
- Are you sure it'sokay to leave her here?

26:14.823 --> 26:17.158
- I'm not crazy, Margaret.

26:18.076 --> 26:19.411
- No, I didn't mean--

26:19.411 --> 26:21.538
(electronic beeping)

26:21.538 --> 26:24.874
- We have a lot ofcatching up to do.

26:25.792 --> 26:27.127
- I'm sorry.

26:27.127 --> 26:28.670
It's just been an insanefew weeks with the finals

26:28.670 --> 26:33.091
and Jen just challengingeverything I do and--

26:33.675 --> 26:34.593
- Well, that's okay.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.303
We've got help now.

26:36.303 --> 26:38.263
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

26:38.263 --> 26:41.558
(electronic clicking)

26:43.435 --> 26:46.104
Okay, well, I'll be back soon.

26:48.481 --> 26:49.733
Bye.

26:49.733 --> 26:52.611
(birds chirping)

26:56.865 --> 26:59.409
(laughing)

26:59.409 --> 27:03.038
(electronic beeping)

27:03.038 --> 27:05.707
Okay, well, I have to run, so.

27:10.003 --> 27:10.962
I love you.

27:12.339 --> 27:13.882
- I love you too.

27:18.053 --> 27:18.970
Okay.

27:27.354 --> 27:28.605
- Is that you?

27:29.773 --> 27:31.941
- During the war, a lotof us gals had to pitch in

27:31.941 --> 27:34.319
when the men left to fight.

27:35.362 --> 27:37.864
We built those bombers.

27:37.864 --> 27:39.407
- You look happy.

27:39.407 --> 27:40.784
- Oh, I was.

27:40.784 --> 27:44.412
We were doing our partto save the world.

27:48.124 --> 27:49.042
Now that,

27:50.210 --> 27:51.503
that was Greg.

27:52.754 --> 27:54.964
I wish you'd known him.

27:54.964 --> 27:56.383
He died in 1945.

27:58.301 --> 28:00.720
He was shot down in Germany.

28:01.805 --> 28:03.682
He was very handsome,

28:04.391 --> 28:06.601
and this, this was Harry,

28:07.352 --> 28:09.979
and this was little Benjamin.

28:10.772 --> 28:12.524
- You raised them on your own?

28:12.524 --> 28:14.401
- Well, they relied on me.

28:14.401 --> 28:17.445
All I could do wasrely on myself.

28:19.155 --> 28:22.033
Look, now that'sMaggie's mother.

28:24.911 --> 28:26.079
That's Helen.

28:30.375 --> 28:32.419
- What happened to her?

28:33.586 --> 28:35.880
- Well, Helen got pregnant

28:37.048 --> 28:38.466
when she was 17,

28:40.635 --> 28:41.970
and she died in a car crash

28:41.970 --> 28:43.930
when Maggie was three.

28:44.931 --> 28:49.018
- So you raised Maggieas well, all alone?

28:49.018 --> 28:52.439
- Well, anyone wouldhave done the same.

28:52.439 --> 28:55.400
- That hasn't beenmy experience.

29:00.947 --> 29:02.282
- Well, anyway,

29:03.741 --> 29:06.953
that's not what Iwas gonna show you.

29:06.953 --> 29:08.288
This.

29:08.288 --> 29:12.083
(gentle music)

29:15.628 --> 29:17.130
- Of course.

29:17.130 --> 29:21.593
- This picture was taken aweek before you disappeared.

29:22.510 --> 29:26.431
Mother didn't come outof her room for weeks.

29:26.431 --> 29:27.474
- I'm sorry.

29:27.474 --> 29:29.934
(gentle instrumental music)

29:29.934 --> 29:33.480
- Why did you waitso long to come back?

29:34.898 --> 29:37.317
- I couldn't remember,

29:37.317 --> 29:39.277
so I just kept moving.

29:40.195 --> 29:41.696
I'm happy I found you.

29:41.696 --> 29:44.782
(instrumental music)

29:45.617 --> 29:47.243
Can I keep this?

29:47.952 --> 29:50.455
- I thought you might want to.

30:04.844 --> 30:06.763
- I'm staying with Maggie.

30:06.763 --> 30:08.515
They placed me there for now.

30:08.515 --> 30:09.390
- Good.

30:11.893 --> 30:14.521
- She doesn't know about me yet.

30:14.521 --> 30:15.438
I don't think I'll be able

30:15.438 --> 30:17.398
to keep it a secret for long.

30:17.398 --> 30:19.526
- Oh, she's a good girl.

30:20.527 --> 30:21.778
- I like her,

30:21.778 --> 30:24.989
but most peoplearen't like you, Rose.

30:24.989 --> 30:26.950
They don't understand.

30:28.952 --> 30:32.497
- Abby, I need youto make me a promise.

30:34.249 --> 30:35.667
- What?

30:35.667 --> 30:37.961
- I need you to take care of her

30:37.961 --> 30:39.587
and sweet Jen too.

30:40.838 --> 30:43.466
Can you do that for me?

30:43.466 --> 30:45.885
- She can look after herself,

30:45.885 --> 30:47.303
just like you did.

30:47.303 --> 30:48.721
- Well, perhaps.

30:50.765 --> 30:53.810
- And I might haveto leave again.

30:55.228 --> 30:59.607
- Well, do your bestas long as you can.

31:10.618 --> 31:12.871
- You can see her, can't you?

31:12.871 --> 31:13.913
- Her?

31:13.913 --> 31:14.873
- My fairy.

31:16.791 --> 31:17.917
- I knew it.

31:17.917 --> 31:20.253
Oh, I just knew it.

31:20.253 --> 31:22.380
Oh, Abby, Abby, show me.

31:23.715 --> 31:24.507
Show me.

31:24.507 --> 31:26.259
Help me see.

31:26.259 --> 31:27.343
- Okay.

31:27.343 --> 31:29.596
(fairy buzzing)

31:29.596 --> 31:32.557
(instrumental music)

31:37.020 --> 31:39.355
(laughing)

31:50.241 --> 31:53.745
- John, can I talkto you for a minute?

32:01.127 --> 32:02.211
How are you?

32:03.463 --> 32:05.465
- Come on, Maggie.

32:05.465 --> 32:07.467
- I'm doing the best I can.

32:07.467 --> 32:09.177
- What do you want?

32:10.970 --> 32:14.724
- I want to sign up thegirls to take lessons

32:14.724 --> 32:16.100
with you this summer.

32:16.100 --> 32:17.268
- [John] Why?

32:18.978 --> 32:21.856
- Well, Abby wasreally taken with you,

32:21.856 --> 32:25.985
and Jen needs somethingto keep her distracted.

32:27.320 --> 32:28.529
- Distracted?

32:30.239 --> 32:32.742
- And I trust you with them.

32:35.745 --> 32:37.580
- I gotta go.

32:37.580 --> 32:38.790
- I will pay you for your time.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.291
Just tell me what you charge.

32:40.291 --> 32:41.167
- 40 an hour.

32:41.167 --> 32:42.543
- Fine.

32:42.543 --> 32:43.419
- Great.

32:43.419 --> 32:45.004
- When would be good for you?

32:45.004 --> 32:48.007
- Whenever's goodfor you, Maggie.

32:52.011 --> 32:53.763
- Tuesdays andThursdays at 2:00,

32:53.763 --> 32:56.974
and we'll just dothem back to back.

32:58.393 --> 32:59.310
- Okay.

33:14.200 --> 33:16.536
So, who wants to go first?

33:19.872 --> 33:20.790
- She can.

33:21.749 --> 33:22.667
- Sure.

33:23.835 --> 33:27.255
- Okay, Jen if you wannawait out on the porch.

33:27.255 --> 33:29.716
You have something toentertain yourself?

33:29.716 --> 33:33.010
- I think I canfigure something out.

33:36.389 --> 33:37.682
- She's cheerful.

33:37.682 --> 33:39.726
(laughing)

33:39.726 --> 33:41.144
So, the guitar.

33:43.730 --> 33:46.232
- Can you play that song youwere playing the other day?

33:46.232 --> 33:47.817
- [John] What song?

33:47.817 --> 33:49.527
- You know, the one at school.

33:49.527 --> 33:51.070
- [John] Ah, yeah, that,

33:51.070 --> 33:54.574
that's just somethingI've been playing with.

33:54.574 --> 33:56.242
It's not finished

33:56.242 --> 33:57.618
- I don't care.

33:58.578 --> 34:02.248
- Okay, but this isyour lesson, not mine,

34:02.248 --> 34:03.833
so once I play it,

34:05.168 --> 34:08.170
we work on chords andfinger placements.

34:08.170 --> 34:10.047
- [Abby] Sounds good.

34:12.675 --> 34:15.969
- So how's it goingover at Maggie's?

34:17.679 --> 34:20.391
I guess you're staying.

34:20.391 --> 34:21.309
- For now.

34:22.185 --> 34:23.770
- [John] That's good.

34:23.770 --> 34:25.271
(tuning the guitar)

34:25.271 --> 34:27.315
- Why are you so mad at her?

34:27.315 --> 34:29.567
- I'm not mad at anybody.

34:30.525 --> 34:33.404
- [Abby] Grownupsalways say that.

34:35.072 --> 34:38.826

34:44.248 --> 34:46.501
(humming)

35:18.825 --> 35:21.119
([Jen] singing scales)

35:24.956 --> 35:27.041
- [John] And let'sdo one higher.

35:27.041 --> 35:29.001
(singing)

35:29.001 --> 35:33.464
- Okay, look, I don't wannasing like opera or anything.

35:33.965 --> 35:35.258
- Fair enough.

35:35.258 --> 35:37.009
- How much longer?

35:37.009 --> 35:40.137
- The warmup's really important,

35:40.137 --> 35:41.806
just a few more exercises.

35:41.806 --> 35:42.974
(sighing)

35:42.974 --> 35:45.518
But it's good to start thinking

35:45.518 --> 35:47.144
about what kind of musicyou'd be interested

35:47.144 --> 35:48.396
in working on.

35:50.940 --> 35:51.774
- I don't know,

35:51.774 --> 35:53.484
like good stuff.

35:53.484 --> 35:55.528
- Good stuff, specific.

35:56.696 --> 35:59.574
Okay, (singing scales).

36:01.659 --> 36:04.495
- Okay, like the stuffyou used to sing.

36:04.495 --> 36:06.372
- Which stuff?

36:06.372 --> 36:08.291
- [Jen] In your band.

36:08.291 --> 36:10.877
- Didn't realizeyou knew about that.

36:10.877 --> 36:13.045
- I know a lot of things.

36:18.551 --> 36:19.427
- Right.

36:21.095 --> 36:22.013
Okay, so,

36:24.891 --> 36:27.143
we'll focus on some rock,

36:27.143 --> 36:29.020
maybe some bluegrass.

36:30.104 --> 36:31.022
- Cool.

36:32.023 --> 36:32.899

It's amazing how people canmake themselves feel invisible

44:05.851 --> 44:08.354
right in front of your eyes.

44:10.689 --> 44:12.524
They don't realizehow lonely it is

44:12.524 --> 44:13.817

44:46.058 --> 44:48.352
- Sure, sure, climb on up.

45:10.582 --> 45:13.043
Do you wanna read out loud?

- Jen?

47:04.488 --> 47:05.656
What's this?

47:16.208 --> 47:18.168
I've seen this before.

47:23.882 --> 47:26.844
- One night, I heard myparents talking about

47:26.844 --> 47:29.680
what I was to be when I grew up.

47:31.223 --> 47:33.559
I didn't wanna grow up,

47:33.559 --> 47:37.020
so I ran away to livewith the fairies.

47:38.397 --> 47:39.731
I thought thattime would pick up

47:39.731 --> 47:41.316
where it left off,

47:42.568 --> 47:43.860
but it hasn't.

47:44.778 --> 47:48.073
It just keeps whirlingby without me.

48:02.671 --> 48:05.340
- Your secret is safe with me.

48:07.968 --> 48:09.052
- Thank you.

48:16.268 --> 48:19.730
- You think you canget some sleep now?

(fairy buzzing)

48:26.445 --> 48:30.240
(gentle instrumental music)

48:41.460 --> 48:44.004
Goodnight, sleep tight.

48:44.004 --> 48:46.965
- Don't let the bed bugs bite.

48:46.965 --> 48:49.426
- See you in the morning light.

48:49.426 --> 48:53.805
- Where we'll do ourbest with all our might.

48:54.473 --> 48:55.641
Never say goodbye

48:55.641 --> 48:59.436
because saying goodbyemeans going away,

48:59.436 --> 49:02.189
and going away means forgetting.

49:28.215 --> 49:29.132
- Abby?

49:31.843 --> 49:34.513
- This won't take long.

49:34.513 --> 49:35.722
Are you okay?

49:45.565 --> 49:48.819
- Hey, sweetheart,tell me your name.

49:50.070 --> 49:50.987
- Abby.

50:03.583 --> 50:05.877
that you are absolutely safe

50:05.877 --> 50:09.256
to reveal anythingwithin these walls.

50:11.758 --> 50:14.136
- What if I don't pass?

50:14.136 --> 50:16.096
Will you send me back?

50:17.222 --> 50:18.348
- Back where?

50:20.976 --> 50:22.144
There's nothing to pass or fail.

50:22.144 --> 50:25.147
I just wanna talkwith you a little bit.

50:25.147 --> 50:26.940
- They all say that.

50:28.066 --> 50:30.569
- [Dr. Gordon] Willyou tell me your story?

50:30.569 --> 50:33.572
(fairy buzzing)

50:40.871 --> 50:42.164
- Alright.

50:42.164 --> 50:46.001
(gentle instrumental music)

50:50.922 --> 50:52.591
- [Dr. Gordon] It mustbe quite a lonely life

50:52.591 --> 50:54.593
moving around all the time,

50:54.593 --> 50:58.346
not being able to share thetruth about who you are,

50:58.346 --> 51:00.265
and for so many years.

51:01.933 --> 51:03.185
- Yes, it is.

51:06.563 --> 51:07.481
It can be.

51:08.565 --> 51:10.233
- You look worried.

51:11.109 --> 51:13.945
- [Abby] I'm not ready to leave.

51:15.322 --> 51:18.617
- What if you didn'thave to leave at all?

51:18.617 --> 51:20.744
- But that's impossible.

51:23.538 --> 51:24.956
- Do you ever wishyou could grow up

51:24.956 --> 51:26.666
like everyone else?

51:30.128 --> 51:32.756
- I wish always to be a girl

51:33.632 --> 51:35.092
and to have fun.

51:36.510 --> 51:38.178
(laughing)

51:38.178 --> 51:39.721
- There are wonderfulthings you can only do

51:39.721 --> 51:41.765
when you're grown up.

51:41.765 --> 51:44.684
- What about theterrible things?

51:52.400 --> 51:54.653
I should be able to fly.

51:54.653 --> 51:57.030
I just never got the knack.

52:03.203 --> 52:06.039
Sometimes I have to run instead,

52:06.039 --> 52:08.083
as fast as I can,

52:08.083 --> 52:11.294
so fast it almostfeels like flying.

52:14.130 --> 52:15.549
- Did that hurt?

52:16.716 --> 52:17.634
- No.

52:39.531 --> 52:42.951
- I'm going to need to takeyou over for some X-rays, okay?

52:42.951 --> 52:44.286
- It's nothing.

52:47.164 --> 52:48.832
- It's not nothing.

53:12.230 --> 53:14.691
(office sounds)

53:22.824 --> 53:25.118
- You shouldn't be in here.

53:25.118 --> 53:26.036
- Sorry.

53:27.495 --> 53:29.581
What happened to her?

53:29.581 --> 53:31.374
- The doctor will come outand explain everything,

53:31.374 --> 53:32.792
but you need to wait out here.

53:32.792 --> 53:34.920
(murmuring)

53:34.920 --> 53:36.129

(apprehensiveinstrumental music)

53:46.806 --> 53:50.101
(car engines running)

53:51.728 --> 53:53.188
- Somebody should havebeen watching her.

53:53.188 --> 53:54.564
- Okay, why don'tyou take the car

53:54.564 --> 53:55.440
and head towards home,

53:55.440 --> 53:56.942
and I'll walk around for a bit

53:56.942 --> 53:58.235
and see if I can find her?

53:58.235 --> 54:01.947
(music begins to build)

54:14.417 --> 54:17.712
Hey, woah, man, you walk fast.

54:17.712 --> 54:19.631
Slow down, Speed Racer.

54:19.631 --> 54:21.841
Okay, home's that way.

Come on.

54:29.140 --> 54:30.058
Okay.

54:32.310 --> 54:34.479
I'll text Mom, okay?

54:34.479 --> 54:35.397
- [Abby] Okay.

54:35.397 --> 54:38.608
(electronic beeping)

54:55.875 --> 54:58.628
- Let's get somefor Rosemary too.

54:58.628 --> 54:59.462
- What?

54:59.462 --> 55:02.007
- I think she likes chocolate.

55:02.007 --> 55:03.133
- Rocky Road.

55:03.133 --> 55:05.510
She likes Rocky Road.

55:05.510 --> 55:07.929
- Can we get a pint please?

55:11.141 --> 55:13.351
- Who did that to you?

55:13.351 --> 55:14.853
Was it Michael?

55:14.853 --> 55:18.565
- No, that would befoster dad number two,

55:21.693 --> 55:23.528
and then yours truly,

55:23.528 --> 55:25.488
the cuts, I mean.

55:25.488 --> 55:28.700
Michael was thefirst decent person.

55:30.869 --> 55:34.289
- How did you end upwith Maggie and Michael?

55:34.289 --> 55:36.541
- Turns out mydeadbeat birth parents

55:36.541 --> 55:40.211
are second cousins toMichael or something.

55:40.211 --> 55:44.632
He found out after the factthat they'd abandoned me.

55:45.216 --> 55:46.885
He tracked me down.

55:47.594 --> 55:49.012
He even became a foster parent

55:49.012 --> 55:51.723
just so he could bring me home.

55:51.723 --> 55:52.974
He adopted me.

55:53.892 --> 55:56.227
So like I said, decent guy.

56:19.751 --> 56:21.753
How are the music lessons going?

56:21.753 --> 56:22.587
- Good.

56:22.587 --> 56:24.255
You should hear Jen sing.

56:24.255 --> 56:25.423
She's wonderful.

56:25.423 --> 56:28.259
- Well, I'd like that very much.

56:31.262 --> 56:34.099
(gentle instrumental music)

56:34.099 --> 56:35.725
Well, look at you.

56:37.852 --> 56:38.770
Come here.

56:43.483 --> 56:45.402
Now that's my Maggie.

56:47.737 --> 56:49.280
The girls brought me ice cream.

56:49.280 --> 56:50.365
- [Maggie] Oh?

56:50.365 --> 56:53.576
- And we have beendiscussing my birthday.

56:53.576 --> 56:54.452
- Right.

56:55.286 --> 56:57.163
- I want to have a party.

56:57.163 --> 57:00.125
I haven't had a party in years.

57:00.125 --> 57:02.919
- Sure, sure, I'llspeak with the staff.

57:02.919 --> 57:04.504
- No, no, not here.

57:04.504 --> 57:08.675
Somewhere far away fromthis stuffy old place.

57:08.675 --> 57:10.718
- We thought we couldhave it in the backyard.

57:10.718 --> 57:12.887
- Yeah, with music and dancing.

57:12.887 --> 57:15.181
- We could decoratewith lights and candles,

57:15.181 --> 57:16.933
reaching all the waydown to the woods.

57:16.933 --> 57:20.603
- And right intofairy land. (laughing)

57:20.603 --> 57:24.232
- Well, if the girlswill help me plan it.

57:24.232 --> 57:25.692
- We'll take care of everything.

57:25.692 --> 57:27.861
- Except for paying for it.

57:27.861 --> 57:28.945
- Oh, right.

57:35.660 --> 57:37.620
Grandma, are you okay?

57:38.329 --> 57:40.832
- Maggie, I wanna come home.

57:43.960 --> 57:45.170
- [Maggie] We talked about this.

57:45.170 --> 57:46.379
I can't offer youthe proper care,

57:46.379 --> 57:48.047
and then what if yourheart gives out again?

57:48.047 --> 57:49.215
- It's okay.

57:49.215 --> 57:50.133
I'm ready.

57:51.259 --> 57:54.929
I wanna be with my familywhen my time comes.

57:55.805 --> 57:58.016
- Please don't talk like that.

57:58.016 --> 58:00.143
- [Rose] Tell her, Abby.

58:03.730 --> 58:04.856
(knocking on door)

58:04.856 --> 58:05.773
- Yes?

58:13.948 --> 58:18.077
Thank you for takingcare of Abby today.

58:18.077 --> 58:20.914
I really appreciate all you did.

58:22.040 --> 58:25.335
- Someone messedher up pretty badly.

58:30.215 --> 58:31.549
- Are you okay?

58:35.720 --> 58:36.721
What is it?

58:38.640 --> 58:40.183
- I miss Michael.

58:41.976 --> 58:44.562
I could talk to him, I guess,

58:45.313 --> 58:47.899
the way Abby can talk to you.

58:49.692 --> 58:50.777
- I'm sorry.

58:52.570 --> 58:53.863
I miss him too.

58:55.573 --> 58:56.491
What?

58:57.534 --> 59:00.453
- [Jen] It's kindof hard to believe.

59:00.453 --> 59:01.371
- Why?

59:03.456 --> 59:04.541
- Nevermind.

59:07.460 --> 59:08.545
- Jen, what?

59:11.297 --> 59:15.093
- I know about theaffair with Mr. Griffin.

59:18.304 --> 59:19.597
- You read my journal.

59:19.597 --> 59:23.268
- I had just startedfeeling like I had a family.

59:23.268 --> 59:24.352
Did you even love Michael,

59:24.352 --> 59:25.895
or was it always a money thing?

59:25.895 --> 59:27.105
- [Maggie] Oh, that's not fair.

59:27.105 --> 59:28.147
- What?

59:28.147 --> 59:29.482
He was like 20 yearsolder than you.

59:29.482 --> 59:31.025
What was I supposed to think?

59:31.025 --> 59:32.485
- [Maggie] It'scomplicated, Jen.

59:32.485 --> 59:34.696
- You think I'm not smartenough to understand?

59:34.696 --> 59:36.531
- [Maggie] I loved him,but I was too young,

59:36.531 --> 59:38.616
and I was just startingmy writing career.

59:38.616 --> 59:40.535
- What writing career?

59:40.535 --> 59:43.746
- I'm trying toexplain that to you.

59:45.415 --> 59:47.333
You know, we neverhad much in common,

59:47.333 --> 59:50.295
and we grew apartover the years.

59:51.462 --> 59:52.588
I was invisible,

59:52.588 --> 59:55.341
and he never took me seriously,

59:56.467 --> 59:58.261
and I lost track of myself,

59:58.261 --> 59:59.387
and then I met John,

59:59.387 --> 01:00:00.638
and he saw me.

01:00:11.983 --> 01:00:13.067
I messed up.

01:00:16.362 --> 01:00:17.488
I messed up.

01:00:25.830 --> 01:00:27.999
- Michael was good to me.

01:00:29.334 --> 01:00:30.752
- He adored you.

01:00:32.503 --> 01:00:34.672
You know, when Michael wasfirst trying to track you down,

01:00:34.672 --> 01:00:36.257
he didn't tell me,

01:00:39.594 --> 01:00:40.762
and then he came home with you,

01:00:40.762 --> 01:00:42.639
and he said youwere staying with us

01:00:42.639 --> 01:00:44.474
and that he wanted to adopt you,

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:48.436
and it was just like hedropped a bomb on me.

01:00:51.064 --> 01:00:54.817
- Kind of like whenyou brought Abby home.

01:00:56.486 --> 01:00:58.696
- I guess so, yeah, yeah.

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:05.453
- I didn't know all of that.

01:01:05.453 --> 01:01:07.038
- [Maggie] No, of course not.

01:01:07.038 --> 01:01:08.289
How could you?

01:01:10.708 --> 01:01:14.754
- I didn't mean to ruinyour life or anything.

01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:20.760
- I didn't have a dad either,

01:01:23.054 --> 01:01:24.472
and I know what that's like,

01:01:24.472 --> 01:01:28.559
and I should have knownhow much you wanted that.

01:01:34.857 --> 01:01:37.610
It's not your fault, any of it.

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:41.697
I'm so sorry.

01:01:45.576 --> 01:01:46.869
- I like Abby.

01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:50.331
I'm glad you brought her home.

01:01:50.331 --> 01:01:51.958
- [Maggie] Me too.

01:01:56.045 --> 01:01:59.257
- Mr. Griffin still loves you.

01:01:59.257 --> 01:02:00.383
It's obvious.

01:02:01.134 --> 01:02:03.761
- I don't know about that.

01:02:03.761 --> 01:02:06.097
- But you love him, right?

01:02:06.889 --> 01:02:08.724
You haven't moved on?

01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:12.770

01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:17.024
