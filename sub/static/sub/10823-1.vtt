WEBVTT

00:01.100 --> 00:03.386
My name is Caleb Rivers.

00:03.408 --> 00:05.419
Last night I got on a bus
to Ravenswood,

00:05.441 --> 00:08.180
thinking I was going to help
my girlfriend, Hanna.

00:08.202 --> 00:10.223
She's the one who asked me
to stay and take care of Miranda.

00:11.361 --> 00:13.305
I just met Miranda
earlier that night,

00:13.330 --> 00:15.194
but we had an immediate
connection.

00:16.229 --> 00:18.252
So, then, who're you
living with now?

00:18.279 --> 00:20.294
- It's complicated.
- Foster home?

00:20.322 --> 00:21.612
You don't have to say
it like that.

00:21.629 --> 00:22.805
You're not gonna
catch something because

00:22.822 --> 00:23.732
we're sharing a seat.

00:23.759 --> 00:25.403
I've spent some time
in a few of them myself.

00:27.311 --> 00:30.076
I came to Ravenswood to find
my only living relative,

00:30.109 --> 00:32.329
an uncle who shipped me
off to strangers

00:32.347 --> 00:34.724
before I can even
memorize his face.

00:35.343 --> 00:36.712
Hanna and I hardly
knew this girl,

00:36.739 --> 00:38.285
but neither one of us
wanted to leave her

00:38.321 --> 00:39.929
alone in a town where
people throw party

00:39.946 --> 00:41.086
in cemeteries.

00:42.968 --> 00:44.921
I'm not scared easily,

00:44.938 --> 00:47.660
not when I need answers
about a family I've never known.

00:47.780 --> 00:50.143
Last night, I found a tombstone
in that cemetery

00:50.166 --> 00:51.637
with my name and face
on it.

00:52.971 --> 00:55.225
And there's a dead Miranda
buried there too.

00:56.170 --> 00:57.858
There's no way either one of us

00:57.884 --> 01:00.827
is getting out of that little bus
until we found out why

01:02.000 --> 01:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:14.797 --> 01:16.664
( Phone beeps )

01:16.666 --> 01:21.502
Ravenswood has to be the only town
in the country without a website.

01:21.504 --> 01:23.871
You know what? It's probably
just a coincidence.

01:23.873 --> 01:26.107
I bet I have relatives here
or something like that.

01:26.109 --> 01:27.941
Yeah, 'cause I'm sure
that happens all the time.

01:27.943 --> 01:29.710
Seeing your name and your face
on a gravestone.

01:29.712 --> 01:31.545
Miranda, I'm not saying
it happens all the time,

01:31.547 --> 01:33.080
but it happened.

01:33.082 --> 01:36.150
There's an explanation,
and we'll find it.

01:36.152 --> 01:38.284
You sound like the guy
in the horror movies,

01:38.286 --> 01:40.653
the one who's all logical
and scientific.

01:40.655 --> 01:43.189
He usually doesn't make it
to the end credits.

01:43.191 --> 01:44.891
Where are you going?

01:44.893 --> 01:47.327
My uncle's house.
Maybe he's back now.

01:52.566 --> 01:54.366
So, how'd you find out
you had an uncle, anyway?

01:54.368 --> 01:56.701
I got a letter from some lawyer
about my parents.

01:56.703 --> 01:59.405
At the bottom, it said a copy
was sent to my mom's brother...

01:59.407 --> 02:02.807
Mr. Raymond Collins,
Sawmill Road, Ravenswood.

02:02.809 --> 02:04.476
Instant family.

02:04.478 --> 02:07.879
I went from excited to
ticked-off in about ten seconds.

02:07.881 --> 02:10.214
- I know the feeling.
- You do?

02:10.216 --> 02:12.350
Yeah. Like I told you
on the bus, I know

02:12.352 --> 02:15.719
what it means to be
a pinball foster kid.

02:15.721 --> 02:19.857
Hey, Caleb, this is it...
my uncle's house.

02:19.859 --> 02:21.426
One hell of a bed-
and-breakfast.

02:23.762 --> 02:27.997
- Is that him?
- I don't know. I haven't seen him since I was three years old.

02:27.999 --> 02:31.834
Maybe he knows about our lookalikes
buried out there in the cemetery.

02:31.836 --> 02:33.803
Yeah.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.919
Mr. Collins?

02:50.921 --> 02:54.156
You are?

02:54.158 --> 02:55.458
Don't you remember me?

02:57.793 --> 02:59.860
I'm Miranda.

02:59.862 --> 03:02.430
Your niece?

03:02.432 --> 03:04.765
What are you doing here?

03:04.767 --> 03:07.868
I think you're supposed
to start off with "hello."

03:07.870 --> 03:10.505
I'm very busy.

03:13.208 --> 03:15.242
You know, I didn't get
to introduce myself.

03:15.244 --> 03:16.876
I'm Caleb Rivers.

03:16.878 --> 03:19.179
Am I supposed to be
related to you, as well?

03:21.082 --> 03:22.449
Miranda wanted to surprise you,

03:22.451 --> 03:24.118
maybe this wasn't
the best way to do it.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.586
Maybe she should've
called first.

03:25.588 --> 03:27.887
You know what,
the point is she's here.

03:27.889 --> 03:29.723
It's been a long night.

03:29.725 --> 03:32.092
I'm sure whoever's
in this bag wouldn't mind

03:32.094 --> 03:34.560
you spending a little time
with your niece.

03:34.562 --> 03:36.162
Did you say your name
is Rivers?

03:36.164 --> 03:38.331
That's right.
Caleb Rivers.

03:38.333 --> 03:41.768
Maybe you recognize it from the
headstone in the cemetery,

03:41.770 --> 03:43.402
the one with the guy
that looks just like me.

03:43.404 --> 03:46.005
I know every tombstone
out there.

03:46.007 --> 03:47.506
There's no Caleb Rivers.

03:48.975 --> 03:52.444
Carla, please show my niece
where she can rest.

03:52.446 --> 03:55.247
Come inside, dear.

04:01.754 --> 04:04.522
Make yourself useful.

04:06.424 --> 04:08.526
( Thunder rumbling,
crow squawking )

04:10.810 --> 04:15.940
<font color="#40bfff">Sync & corrections by</font> <font color="#FFA500">wilson0804</font>
<font color="#40bfff">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

04:16.434 --> 04:18.267
Does he treat
everyone like that,

04:18.269 --> 04:20.370
or does he just save it
for his family?

04:20.372 --> 04:22.706
He has no family left.

04:22.708 --> 04:24.240
I'm his family.

04:24.242 --> 04:26.710
Maybe I'm just a crummy niece,
but I'm family.

04:26.712 --> 04:29.345
Then you're all he has.

04:29.347 --> 04:31.114
How long have you worked here?

04:31.116 --> 04:33.216
Oh, a very long time.

04:33.218 --> 04:35.117
But there was a brief period

04:35.119 --> 04:37.452
where I worked
at a college nearby.

04:37.454 --> 04:38.988
- You came back?
- Mm-hmm.

04:38.990 --> 04:41.791
- Why?
- Mr. Collins asked me to.

04:41.793 --> 04:44.393
By that time, I was ready.

04:44.395 --> 04:49.665
College girls can be
very unstructured.

04:49.667 --> 04:51.966
( Water running )

04:54.804 --> 04:57.505
If you have any influence
with my niece,

04:57.507 --> 05:00.308
I suggest you use it
to get her to leave.

05:00.310 --> 05:03.678
It's better for everyone.

05:03.680 --> 05:05.246
Obviously better for you.

05:05.248 --> 05:07.715
Don't think this
is about me, Mr. Rivers.

05:07.717 --> 05:11.085
I promise you, you'd be wrong.

05:13.354 --> 05:17.224
Miranda found her name, too.
And her picture

05:17.226 --> 05:19.860
on a headstone, which made
me double curious.

05:19.862 --> 05:21.595
Made me want to dig in there

05:21.597 --> 05:23.696
and really find out
what's going on.

05:23.698 --> 05:26.099
I can be very annoying
when I get like that.

05:33.540 --> 05:35.208
He just moved.

05:35.210 --> 05:37.610
Spinal cord,
Mr. Rivers.

05:37.612 --> 05:40.545
It works even
after the brain stops.

05:40.547 --> 05:44.049
Um, where did that lady
take Miranda?

05:44.051 --> 05:47.252
Mrs. Grunwald probably
took her upstairs.

05:47.254 --> 05:48.519
The house is through that door.

06:00.565 --> 06:03.500
( Rumbling )

06:08.373 --> 06:09.806
( Door opens )

06:10.975 --> 06:12.475
What?

06:12.477 --> 06:13.877
Did you hear that?

06:13.879 --> 06:16.146
Hear what?

06:16.148 --> 06:19.749
Uh... nothing.

06:19.751 --> 06:22.185
Nothing. Never mind. Um...

06:22.187 --> 06:24.120
Did you talk to my uncle?

06:24.122 --> 06:28.657
Yeah. You get all your charm from
your father's side of the family.

06:30.660 --> 06:32.294
Hey, so what happened
to you out there?

06:32.296 --> 06:33.896
You kind of choked
when you met him.

06:33.898 --> 06:36.631
- I didn't choke.
- Dude, you choked.

06:36.633 --> 06:38.566
Okay, what is this,
my employee review?

06:45.674 --> 06:47.675
- How's the scenery?
- Different.

06:52.981 --> 06:55.850
Why would she be
cleaning a headstone?

06:55.852 --> 06:58.185
( Scrubbing )

06:58.187 --> 07:00.353
Mom, please, let me do it.

07:00.355 --> 07:02.122
Or let me tell someone.

07:02.124 --> 07:05.758
You shouldn't be
doing this yourself.

07:05.760 --> 07:08.361
- Mom!
- Hand me the other brush.

07:08.363 --> 07:09.796
Why are you letting her do this

07:09.798 --> 07:11.397
she won't let me tell anyone.

07:11.399 --> 07:13.333
Well, I already did.

07:13.335 --> 07:16.001
The cops need to know
about this, mom.

07:16.003 --> 07:17.937
Because they've been
so helpful to us.

07:17.939 --> 07:19.438
Mom, come on.

07:19.440 --> 07:21.807
They know what the people
in this town think of me,

07:21.809 --> 07:23.775
and they think it themselves.

07:26.179 --> 07:27.679
What did you tell them?

07:27.681 --> 07:29.181
Nothing. They
wouldn't talk.

07:29.183 --> 07:31.850
Mom! If you want to help,
grab a brush.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.718
They're just gonna do it again.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.019
Then we'll clean it again.

07:35.021 --> 07:36.487
It's not gonna change anything.

07:36.489 --> 07:37.856
People will still
say she did it.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.390
It doesn't matter
what they say, Luke.

07:39.392 --> 07:41.226
- It isn't true.
- The cops don't know that.

07:41.228 --> 07:43.862
Liv, all they know is
that somebody killed dad,

07:43.864 --> 07:46.196
and there's no one else
on the radar but mom.

07:46.198 --> 07:47.497
Fine. You win.

07:47.499 --> 07:50.067
You know what, I'm gonna
live my life.

07:50.069 --> 07:52.269
And mom should, too,
because hiding in her room

07:52.271 --> 07:53.937
is obviously not helping
her cause.

08:03.480 --> 08:06.515
Hey, if you're leaving,
I'm coming with you.

08:11.488 --> 08:13.756
Where'd they go?

08:13.758 --> 08:16.259
I don't know.

08:19.262 --> 08:22.063
What the hell is going on?

08:22.065 --> 08:25.867
Who are those kids?
Who's the black widow?

08:25.869 --> 08:30.405
Come on. Let's take pictures
of our tombstones.

08:30.407 --> 08:32.107
We'll show your uncle.

08:32.109 --> 08:34.942
He can't deny what he sees
in a photograph.

08:43.919 --> 08:45.286
What is this?

08:45.288 --> 08:46.520
Carl Ridgley?

08:49.891 --> 08:51.624
Is this the right place?

08:51.626 --> 08:53.092
Yes, it is the right place.

08:53.094 --> 08:56.195
I counted all the rows
and the stones last night.

08:56.197 --> 08:58.197
Are you saying we didn't see
what we saw last night?

08:58.199 --> 08:59.698
Because I know what we saw.

08:59.700 --> 09:02.468
No, Miranda, we saw it,
it's just not here now.

09:02.470 --> 09:04.804
So, somebody
switched headstones?

09:04.806 --> 09:06.571
Who would do that? Why?

09:06.573 --> 09:08.907
The only person I told
about this was your uncle.

09:08.909 --> 09:11.076
Hey, where are you going?

09:11.078 --> 09:13.111
You can only learn
so much in a graveyard.

09:13.113 --> 09:14.379
I'm going into town.

09:14.381 --> 09:16.381
There has to be
a newspaper or a library

09:16.383 --> 09:17.749
where I can look up obituaries.

09:17.751 --> 09:19.418
Are you okay if I go?

09:19.420 --> 09:23.187
If you're okay with me taking
another run at Mr. charm.

09:23.189 --> 09:25.189
I came here for answers.

09:25.191 --> 09:27.658
I'm not leaving until I get
something from him.

09:35.100 --> 09:37.401
♪

09:41.505 --> 09:44.474
They'll close Central Avenue
for the parade at 6:00.

09:44.476 --> 09:46.076
It's, uh, the only time

09:46.078 --> 09:48.911
that officer hogan
ever gets to write tickets,

09:48.913 --> 09:51.581
so, um, park at the school
and then walk over.

09:51.583 --> 09:54.283
By the way, I need
my physics book back by Monday.

09:54.285 --> 09:56.953
I'll see you tonight, then.

09:56.955 --> 10:00.756
Hey. So, are you guys actually
"the source since 1862"?

10:00.758 --> 10:03.359
Not me personally, but the
paper's been here that long.

10:03.361 --> 10:06.361
Well, um, I need to talk to
somebody about an obituary.

10:06.363 --> 10:07.596
I'm sorry to hear that.

10:07.598 --> 10:08.997
No, not a new one.
It's actually

10:08.999 --> 10:10.499
from a long time ago.
Relative.

10:10.501 --> 10:12.333
- What's the name?
- Caleb Rivers.

10:12.335 --> 10:14.636
That's your name
or the relative's?

10:14.638 --> 10:17.606
- Both.
- You know when he died?

10:17.608 --> 10:19.673
It'd have to be 100 years ago.

10:19.675 --> 10:21.775
Well, we have copies
of all the editions

10:21.777 --> 10:23.276
since the civil war downstairs.

10:23.278 --> 10:24.778
You can take a look
if you'd like.

10:24.780 --> 10:26.881
Are you finished
with those classified ads?

10:26.883 --> 10:28.315
- Almost, dad.
- Almost?

10:28.317 --> 10:30.818
Why don't I help the young man.

10:30.820 --> 10:33.888
So, can I go down and find the
old papers and find my relative?

10:33.890 --> 10:35.889
I'm afraid I can't let you
down in the morgue alone.

10:35.891 --> 10:39.091
- The morgue?
- That's where we keep all the old editions.

10:41.695 --> 10:43.630
It's not like a library
down there.

10:43.632 --> 10:45.965
I just can't have people
browsing around.

10:45.967 --> 10:48.968
But if you want, I'll find out
more about this relative of yours.

10:48.970 --> 10:51.070
I suggest you check the county
records over at Driscoll.

10:51.072 --> 10:53.572
You come back with a specific
date, I'll see what I can do.

10:53.574 --> 10:56.742
Thanks.

11:14.026 --> 11:17.394
I was looking for you.

11:17.396 --> 11:20.064
It's a big house.

11:20.066 --> 11:22.332
It's easy to get lost.

11:22.334 --> 11:25.602
Especially when the person you're
looking for doesn't want to be found.

11:25.604 --> 11:28.738
This is what you do
for a living?

11:28.740 --> 11:31.708
And my father, and his father.

11:31.710 --> 11:34.778
Did you do it
for my parents when they died?

11:34.780 --> 11:37.948
No. I was
unqualified then.

11:37.950 --> 11:40.216
You were too young
to remember that.

11:40.218 --> 11:42.952
I was too young to remember
all sorts of things, actually.

11:42.954 --> 11:46.456
You were at their funeral.
I remember that.

11:46.458 --> 11:50.126
You were my only living relative,
and you left me with strangers.

11:50.128 --> 11:53.429
Why did you do that?

11:53.431 --> 11:56.631
There was no way I could
explain it to you then.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.267
You've had plenty
of time since.

11:59.269 --> 12:02.537
You could've called me.
You could've written a letter.

12:02.539 --> 12:05.207
- You could've sent a Christmas card...
- I thought that was best.

12:05.209 --> 12:07.775
Well, you were wrong.

12:07.777 --> 12:10.178
I realized that when I
saw you this morning...

12:11.947 --> 12:13.780
But the damage is done.

12:13.782 --> 12:16.450
You should go back
to your foster family.

12:16.452 --> 12:19.487
I would go back if I could,
and I can't.

12:19.489 --> 12:23.457
You know what, I was afraid
of you this morning outside,

12:23.459 --> 12:26.727
and I was so afraid that I had
forgotten how angry I am,

12:26.729 --> 12:30.463
but I'm better now, and we have
a lot of catching up to do.

12:30.465 --> 12:33.065
I don't think that would do
either one of us much good.

12:33.067 --> 12:34.434
Hey, I'm over here.

12:34.436 --> 12:37.770
Your actual live niece,
remember?

12:37.772 --> 12:40.973
Now, I'm not going anywhere
until you answer some questions

12:40.975 --> 12:43.409
about me, about my parents,
about what happened to them.

12:43.411 --> 12:47.312
Mr. Collins,
the Shuberts are here.

12:47.314 --> 12:49.948
Excuse me.

12:54.854 --> 12:57.222
Hey.

12:58.424 --> 13:00.358
Be patient with him.

13:00.360 --> 13:04.728
You brought questions,
but you also brought memories.

13:04.730 --> 13:07.031
What do I have to do
to get his attention,

13:07.033 --> 13:09.200
crawl in one of those boxes?

13:19.132 --> 13:22.001
It's too messy for
voicemail, but I'm okay.

13:22.003 --> 13:26.339
I'm gonna head home as soon
as Miranda settles in.

13:26.341 --> 13:28.507
I love you, Hannah.

13:28.509 --> 13:29.908
Call me.

13:32.645 --> 13:36.314
Two-fisted coffee drinker.
That's serious.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.616
Uh, one's for my friend.

13:38.985 --> 13:41.420
Um, is this your relative?

13:41.422 --> 13:45.022
I haven't found the obituary,
but does this help?

13:45.024 --> 13:48.092
He looks just like you.

13:50.228 --> 13:52.363
So, what time are we
meeting tonight?

13:52.365 --> 13:54.665
- I'm not even sure I'm going.
- Does Dillon know that?

13:54.667 --> 13:57.167
What, is Luke
not going, either?

13:57.169 --> 14:00.871
I have no idea.
Ask him yourself.

14:00.873 --> 14:04.875
Livy, are you not going
tonight because of your dad?

14:04.877 --> 14:08.311
You know he'd want you
there, and Luke, too.

14:08.313 --> 14:09.713
I know it won't be the same,

14:09.715 --> 14:11.715
but the police are
gonna figure this out,

14:11.717 --> 14:13.383
and in the meantime
you can't hide.

14:13.385 --> 14:15.552
I'm not my mom.
I'm not hiding, Tess.

14:15.554 --> 14:17.686
Okay, you're half hiding,
like your brother.

14:17.688 --> 14:19.722
- I'm not my brother.
- In two months,

14:19.724 --> 14:23.126
Luke went from Mr. popular
to lone-wolf-hermit boy.

14:23.128 --> 14:25.028
People are literally
scared of him.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.695
He's more scared than they are.

14:26.697 --> 14:29.132
I get it, but how
does that help?

14:29.134 --> 14:31.801
If you keep thinking there
are monsters under your bed,

14:31.803 --> 14:33.101
you're never gonna
get out of it.

14:33.103 --> 14:34.336
Might as well be dead.

14:34.338 --> 14:35.971
I can't believe
I just said that.

14:35.973 --> 14:38.540
Please smack me.

14:38.542 --> 14:41.443
♪ ( Rock )

14:41.445 --> 14:44.212
What do you guys think?
It's my parade car.

14:44.214 --> 14:45.447
It's okay.

14:45.449 --> 14:47.950
- Okay?
- She's beautiful, Dillon.

14:47.952 --> 14:53.087
Well, ahh... why don't
you try her on for size?

14:53.089 --> 14:55.256
- Go ahead.
- In the middle of town? I...

14:55.258 --> 14:57.325
royalty must never be shy.

15:01.163 --> 15:02.930
Thank you.

15:02.932 --> 15:05.966
I feel silly.

15:05.968 --> 15:08.935
You look like what a homecoming
queen's supposed to look like.

15:08.937 --> 15:10.736
You and me,
makeovers at 6:00.

15:10.738 --> 15:12.939
Gonna make some
magic. And you...

15:12.941 --> 15:14.640
practice driving nice and slow.

15:14.642 --> 15:17.010
I don't want my best friend
getting bugs in her teeth.

15:17.012 --> 15:18.544
Anything you say.

15:29.422 --> 15:32.191
You know, I'm telling you
some pretty weird stuff,

15:32.193 --> 15:35.961
and you're acting like I'm giving
the weather report. Why is that?

15:35.963 --> 15:38.963
We have a different kind
of ordinary in this town.

15:38.965 --> 15:41.699
What's that supposed to mean?

15:49.941 --> 15:52.643
When I was 11, I went
to sleepaway camp.

15:52.645 --> 15:57.280
And one night, all of us kids were sitting
around the campfire telling ghost stories.

15:57.282 --> 16:00.217
One kid talked about
a haunted house in Ravenswood.

16:00.219 --> 16:03.686
And the next kid talked about a ghost
in the Ravenswood movie theater.

16:03.688 --> 16:06.490
And then I finally said,
"hey, I live in Ravenswood.

16:06.492 --> 16:09.425
That's my town,"
and they all got really quiet.

16:11.028 --> 16:12.661
That was the first time
I realized

16:12.663 --> 16:14.830
that people look at
this place differently.

16:14.832 --> 16:16.399
All that stuff doesn't
just come out of nowhere.

16:16.401 --> 16:17.699
Something had to have happened.

16:17.701 --> 16:20.469
See the mark on the wall?

16:20.471 --> 16:26.074
That's the level
the floodwaters reached in 1896.

16:26.076 --> 16:29.844
The reservoir burst, and a couple
of billion gallons of water

16:29.846 --> 16:32.680
came through the middle
of town like a freight train.

16:32.682 --> 16:35.550
They were pulling bodies
out of trees for six months.

16:35.552 --> 16:39.154
People said this town would
just go away, but it didn't.

16:39.156 --> 16:42.722
They rebuilt, and it's
beautiful, and I love it here.

16:42.724 --> 16:44.658
- But-
- But there's so much death.

16:44.660 --> 16:46.527
It's like the town's
soaked in it.

16:46.529 --> 16:48.695
It's a part of who we are.

16:48.697 --> 16:52.499
Hey, Luke.
Where's your sister?

16:52.501 --> 16:55.502
- Shut up, springer.
- What happens if she loses tonight?

16:55.504 --> 16:57.870
Think she'll go after
the judges with a knife?

16:57.872 --> 17:01.274
You know what they say.
Like mother, like daughter.

17:08.815 --> 17:10.883
- Have a problem here?
- No, we're good.

17:10.885 --> 17:12.984
Mm.

17:15.421 --> 17:17.155
I'm gonna remember you.

17:19.058 --> 17:21.792
It's like this town
invented hospitality.

17:21.795 --> 17:24.194
Luke.

17:24.196 --> 17:28.933
Hey, I know it's hard,
but you can get through this.

17:28.935 --> 17:31.636
I'm not the one
with the problem.

17:31.638 --> 17:34.137
It's the rest of this town.

17:41.245 --> 17:43.413
You one of Remy's friends?

17:43.415 --> 17:46.917
Uh, yeah, friend of the family.

17:46.919 --> 17:49.086
Benjamin price.

17:49.088 --> 17:50.586
I'm one of her teachers.

17:50.588 --> 17:51.654
Caleb Rivers.

17:55.425 --> 17:57.226
Are you okay?

17:57.228 --> 17:58.728
I'm great.

17:58.730 --> 18:01.063
My father was murdered,
but you know all about that,

18:01.065 --> 18:03.799
because according to your dad's
newspaper my mom killed him.

18:03.801 --> 18:05.167
I'm sorry.
I know what happened,

18:05.169 --> 18:06.835
but you haven't spoken
to me in weeks,

18:06.837 --> 18:08.436
and I'm just asking
how you are.

18:08.438 --> 18:10.171
Don't treat me like springer.

18:10.173 --> 18:11.906
I'm sorry.

18:11.908 --> 18:13.574
I'm sorry.

18:13.576 --> 18:15.510
It's okay.

18:15.512 --> 18:17.679
It's not, 'cause I
miss talking, you know?

18:17.681 --> 18:19.981
Why did you stop?

18:19.983 --> 18:23.416
Heard your mom's back home.

18:23.418 --> 18:27.021
Yeah, she got back from
Afghanistan a couple days ago.

18:27.023 --> 18:30.323
That must feel good,
having her home.

18:30.325 --> 18:31.892
It does.

18:33.762 --> 18:35.029
You okay?

18:37.632 --> 18:40.633
I came here to take care of you,
not the other way around.

18:40.635 --> 18:42.535
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

18:42.537 --> 18:44.671
- Sorry.
- It'll be okay.

18:44.673 --> 18:47.073
It's okay.

18:47.075 --> 18:52.812
Remy, I thought you were
coming back with coffee.

18:52.814 --> 18:56.081
I got a little busy.

18:56.083 --> 18:58.116
Come on.
I'll walk you back.

20:03.846 --> 20:05.613
( Gasps )

20:13.212 --> 20:18.371
It was wet, not damp, okay?
A puddle.

20:18.373 --> 20:20.506
Maybe there's
a broken pipe or something.

20:20.508 --> 20:21.775
This is not about a broken pipe.

20:21.777 --> 20:23.210
Miranda, this house is old.

20:23.212 --> 20:25.011
I know, it's huge,
it has its own weather,

20:25.013 --> 20:26.946
but this is not about
bad plumbing, Caleb!

20:26.948 --> 20:29.382
There was somebody
behind those curtains!

20:29.384 --> 20:32.017
- Maybe it was the wind.
- This wind had hands.

20:32.019 --> 20:35.087
You know what, we don't
have to do this, okay?

20:35.089 --> 20:37.089
There's a bus
that leaves tonight.

20:37.091 --> 20:39.225
Wait. I haven't even heard
from my dad.

20:39.227 --> 20:42.394
Seriously, even if he told you
your family once owned this town,

20:42.396 --> 20:44.429
is that gonna make you
want to stick around?

20:44.431 --> 20:47.032
- Not me.
- Okay, but don't you at least want to know

20:47.034 --> 20:49.068
who switched out those graves?

20:49.070 --> 20:51.137
- If that was your uncle...
- Don't call him my uncle.

20:51.139 --> 20:53.906
He's a stranger, and he clearly
wants to stay that way.

20:53.908 --> 20:55.775
Okay, but why?

20:55.777 --> 20:58.576
Why is he lying to you?
Why is he lying to me?

20:58.578 --> 21:01.212
He doesn't even know me.
What is he hiding?

21:01.214 --> 21:04.249
- I want answers.
- ( Knocking )

21:08.254 --> 21:11.222
Mr. Collins would like you
to join him for dinner.

21:11.224 --> 21:14.925
Uh, sorry, I've got
a bus to catch.

21:14.927 --> 21:17.494
Sounds great.
I'll wait here.

21:17.496 --> 21:19.629
If you'd like to wash
up, there's a bathroom

21:19.631 --> 21:22.933
you can use down the hall.
There's a tub.

21:22.935 --> 21:24.601
Oh, I'm more a shower
kind of guy.

21:24.603 --> 21:29.239
We have a tub. It's deep.
You won't be disappointed.

21:29.241 --> 21:32.508
I'll let your uncle know
that you'll be staying.

21:32.510 --> 21:34.243
You'll be pleased.

21:37.480 --> 21:40.983
This has to be
her idea, not his.

21:40.985 --> 21:43.186
It's just dinner.
Let's play nice.

21:43.188 --> 21:44.854
Maybe we'll get some answers.

21:44.856 --> 21:47.189
Will you be there?

21:47.191 --> 21:48.723
The parade?

21:50.492 --> 21:52.593
Gotta study
for a chemistry test.

21:52.595 --> 21:54.429
You have all day tomorrow.

21:54.431 --> 21:56.597
Assigned tonight.

22:03.671 --> 22:06.340
If that's for mom,
don't bother.

22:06.342 --> 22:08.408
She's already asleep.

22:15.483 --> 22:19.152
It'd be nice if someone from the
family could be there tonight.

22:19.154 --> 22:21.221
I can't believe
you're even going.

22:21.223 --> 22:23.289
You saw what was
on that headstone.

22:23.291 --> 22:26.226
You know what this town
thinks of mom, of us.

22:26.228 --> 22:28.161
It's not the whole town, okay?

22:28.163 --> 22:29.729
Tess doesn't think...

22:29.731 --> 22:31.597
Tess is not your friend.

22:31.599 --> 22:33.333
What is that supposed to mean?

22:33.335 --> 22:36.835
She's not. She... she uses you
to feel better about herself.

22:36.837 --> 22:38.636
Luke, I know
who my friends are.

22:38.638 --> 22:42.607
Really? Which one of them is
missing a can of red spray paint?

22:48.581 --> 22:49.748
( Door slams )

22:49.750 --> 22:52.684
( Clock chimes )

22:57.523 --> 22:59.991
Thanks.

22:59.993 --> 23:02.326
Thank you.

23:02.328 --> 23:06.030
So, this town
sure likes to party.

23:06.032 --> 23:08.665
Big bash in the cemetery one
night, parade on the next.

23:08.667 --> 23:10.166
Do you plan on attending that?

23:10.168 --> 23:12.202
Sure. Why not?

23:12.204 --> 23:14.170
I love a parade.

23:14.172 --> 23:17.875
Did you explore the town, too?

23:17.877 --> 23:19.943
Did she grow up in this house?

23:19.945 --> 23:22.779
- Who?
- My mother.

23:22.781 --> 23:25.515
The bedroom that you
put me in... was it hers?

23:25.517 --> 23:26.816
( Utensil clatters )

23:26.818 --> 23:30.520
It was. Why?

23:30.522 --> 23:33.756
It's just a little...
Suffocating?

23:33.758 --> 23:35.625
For a teenager.

23:35.627 --> 23:38.294
I can see why she may have wanted
to run away and get married.

23:38.296 --> 23:42.263
I think your mother had many
reasons for running away.

23:42.265 --> 23:44.933
If I'd had her imagination,

23:44.935 --> 23:47.335
I might've joined her.

23:56.912 --> 24:00.147
This belonged to your mother.

24:06.487 --> 24:09.055
Last year, the French club
tried to turn Don Rollen's car

24:09.057 --> 24:10.723
into a giant
chocolate croissant.

24:10.725 --> 24:12.559
But it wasn't really
well executed,

24:12.561 --> 24:15.495
and everyone thought it was
a giant exploding diaper.

24:15.497 --> 24:17.830
Heh. Well, you had
a few of those.

24:17.832 --> 24:19.565
Ha ha ha!

24:19.567 --> 24:20.899
Sorry, did I say that out loud?

24:20.901 --> 24:24.937
Oh, come on,
I'm still eating here.

24:24.939 --> 24:27.539
I don't know about you,
but mine is getting cold.

24:27.541 --> 24:29.608
- I'm gonna go reheat...
- No, no, let me.

24:29.610 --> 24:32.010
I remember where
the microwave is.

24:38.316 --> 24:40.918
I don't want to do this
in front of your mother,

24:40.920 --> 24:42.687
but we need to talk about Luke.

24:42.689 --> 24:44.889
Wow, am I allowed
to say his name now?

24:44.891 --> 24:47.291
What do you want me to do,
treat him like a stranger?

24:47.293 --> 24:49.459
I told you to put
some distance between you.

24:49.461 --> 24:52.362
You did that for me, dad.
He can read.

24:52.364 --> 24:55.164
Look, Remy, he's made
some bad choices.

24:55.166 --> 24:57.534
This isn't the same boy who used
to sit in our den playing...

24:57.536 --> 25:00.169
Yes, it is.
If he lied to the police,

25:00.171 --> 25:01.805
he did it to protect
his mother.

25:01.807 --> 25:03.172
My job is to protect you.

25:03.174 --> 25:04.940
I don't want you
seeing him anymore.

25:04.942 --> 25:06.041
Period.

25:14.183 --> 25:17.686
Do you have any idea what made him
break down and give it to you?

25:17.688 --> 25:20.688
Um, maybe Grunwald
convinced him?

25:20.690 --> 25:22.390
She wants to talk, I can tell,

25:22.392 --> 25:23.892
every time she looks at me.

25:23.894 --> 25:26.394
Really? Every time
she looks at me,

25:26.396 --> 25:29.296
I feel like someone's taking
a potato peeler to my skin.

25:29.298 --> 25:31.799
She knows more
about my family than I do.

25:36.738 --> 25:38.872
Who's that?

25:38.874 --> 25:41.107
My mother, I think.

25:47.081 --> 25:49.583
Well, I'm gonna go
take that bath now.

25:49.585 --> 25:51.652
You gonna be okay if I...?

25:51.654 --> 25:52.852
Yeah.

25:52.854 --> 25:54.086
Okay.

25:58.025 --> 25:59.592
( Door closes )

26:11.737 --> 26:13.672
<i>My dearest Miranda,</i>

26:13.674 --> 26:16.708
<i>your father and I can't wait</i>
<i>for you to be born,</i>

26:16.710 --> 26:19.578
<i>to see your face,</i>
<i>your eyes, your smile;</i>

26:19.580 --> 26:23.582
<i>to find out what you like,</i>
<i>what you love.</i>

26:23.584 --> 26:25.616
( Slams )

27:14.395 --> 27:17.531
Ugh!
( Gasping )

27:26.174 --> 27:28.742
( Coughing )

27:49.822 --> 27:51.322
We didn't get off
on this street.

27:51.324 --> 27:53.992
Are you sure the bus
station is down here?

27:53.994 --> 27:57.849
- Caleb?
- What? Uh, yeah.

27:57.867 --> 27:59.700
I passed by this morning.

27:59.702 --> 28:01.401
I saw someone buying a ticket.

28:01.403 --> 28:04.604
Well, let's hope
it wasn't the last one.

28:04.606 --> 28:09.008
So, uh, it wasn't just
photos in the album.

28:09.010 --> 28:10.710
There was a letter from my mom.

28:10.712 --> 28:13.179
She wrote to me
right before I was born.

28:13.181 --> 28:17.217
Yeah, I guess I was, um, kind
of an unwelcome surprise,

28:17.219 --> 28:21.221
but by the time I was kicking,
she really wanted to meet me.

28:21.223 --> 28:22.722
When did you read this?

28:22.724 --> 28:24.789
While you were taking
the longest bath

28:24.791 --> 28:26.291
in the history of bathing.

28:26.293 --> 28:28.894
I wasn't bathing.
Your uncle tried to drown me.

28:28.896 --> 28:31.830
- Wait, what?
- Yeah, I closed my eyes,

28:31.832 --> 28:34.132
and next thing I knew
I was being held underwater.

28:34.134 --> 28:37.169
You know, we...
we haven't slept...

28:37.171 --> 28:39.337
Miranda, it wasn't
dozing, okay?

28:39.339 --> 28:42.106
Your wind had hands?
My shower curtain had shoulders.

28:42.108 --> 28:43.975
Why would he go after you?

28:43.977 --> 28:45.142
You tell me.

28:45.144 --> 28:47.144
Apparently switching
those headstones

28:47.146 --> 28:48.679
wasn't enough
to get us to leave.

28:48.681 --> 28:52.183
( Phone ringing )

28:52.185 --> 28:54.918
Oh, hey, it's my dad.
Um, I'm gonna take this.

28:54.920 --> 28:57.587
Okay, you just stay here.
I'll get the tickets.

29:08.132 --> 29:09.266
Hey.

29:11.434 --> 29:14.203
Mom, are you having
nightmares again?

29:16.172 --> 29:18.640
I hate disturbing your dad.

29:18.642 --> 29:21.777
I wake up and he wakes up...

29:21.779 --> 29:23.779
Neither one of us
falls back asleep.

29:23.781 --> 29:26.382
It's just better
if I'm down here.

29:26.384 --> 29:28.182
If you want, I could
stay down here with you.

29:28.184 --> 29:30.118
So I can disturb you?

29:30.120 --> 29:33.121
No, so if you wake up
and you need to talk, I'm here.

29:33.123 --> 29:34.890
You always used
to do that for me.

29:36.659 --> 29:40.161
Did dad tell you that we
found a huge office space just...

29:40.163 --> 29:42.130
I'm not looking
to run a clinic.

29:42.132 --> 29:44.164
Why not? I mean,
we could use another one.

29:44.166 --> 29:46.233
Nobody wants to go to Dr. Frankle anymore.
He's so old!

29:46.235 --> 29:49.303
- He's not that old.
- Mom, when he coughs, there's dust.

29:49.305 --> 29:51.171
It's like when you beat a rug.

29:51.173 --> 29:53.507
Well, I'm not ready
to treat the whole town.

29:53.509 --> 29:56.911
Sure you are.
We need you.

29:56.913 --> 30:00.179
( Sighs ) You're gonna be late.

30:00.181 --> 30:02.816
Mom, what can I do?
I wanna help.

30:02.818 --> 30:04.918
Honey, I don't need help.

30:04.920 --> 30:06.385
I just need some time

30:06.387 --> 30:08.054
to figure it out, okay?

30:08.056 --> 30:11.524
Everyone else
in my unit is gone.

30:11.526 --> 30:14.894
I don't Eve know why I'm here.

30:14.896 --> 30:16.762
It doesn't make
any sense that I'm

30:16.764 --> 30:19.631
the only one that
survived the attack.

30:23.703 --> 30:26.572
If you see Luke tonight...

30:26.574 --> 30:28.674
Tell him I said hello.

30:30.242 --> 30:32.009
I was sorry to hear
about his father.

30:51.395 --> 30:55.397
I made up the room
across the hall from your niece.

30:55.399 --> 30:58.400
I'm guessing you'll want
to be close to her.

30:58.402 --> 31:02.605
I don't expect them
to be coming back here.

31:02.607 --> 31:06.375
It's not too late to fix this.

31:21.390 --> 31:22.857
( Gasps )

31:32.600 --> 31:34.402
( Gasps )

31:34.404 --> 31:36.070
You okay?
What just happened?

31:36.072 --> 31:39.440
I... I thought I saw her
again in the window...

31:39.442 --> 31:42.376
that woman from my room.

31:47.681 --> 31:50.816
What? What is it?

31:50.818 --> 31:52.618
Is that the girl that you
spoke to this morning?

31:52.620 --> 31:54.954
Yeah, and our answer's
in that basement.

31:54.956 --> 31:58.525
I wonder if she'd give us a little
tour now that daddy's not around.

31:58.527 --> 32:00.292
Well, what about the bus?

32:00.294 --> 32:03.262
We have time.
Come on.

32:16.923 --> 32:19.525
( Band playing,
bystanders cheering )

32:53.458 --> 32:57.061
- ( Door rattles )
- Hello? Dad?

33:30.393 --> 33:33.661
( Gasps ) What the hell?
You scared me to death!

33:33.663 --> 33:35.163
Sorry, that wasn't the plan.

33:37.266 --> 33:38.766
Miranda, this is Remy.

33:38.768 --> 33:41.769
It's kind of late
to be working, isn't it?

33:41.771 --> 33:44.873
It's kind of illegal for you
to be here, isn't it?

33:44.875 --> 33:48.075
Look, I'm not the only one who saw
my face on a grave last night.

33:48.077 --> 33:51.411
There's also Miranda Collins
buried in that cemetery.

33:51.413 --> 33:53.881
And she looks just like me.

33:53.883 --> 33:56.717
So they're related to you...
distant aunts, uncles.

33:56.719 --> 33:58.919
It makes sense.
We get it, but...

33:58.921 --> 34:01.688
what doesn't make sense is that somebody
doesn't want us to know about it.

34:01.690 --> 34:03.356
Last night we saw their graves,

34:03.358 --> 34:04.958
and then when we
went back today,

34:04.960 --> 34:06.459
somebody had changed them out.

34:10.063 --> 34:11.998
Let's find out why.

35:13.023 --> 35:15.291
Olivia, wait!

35:20.596 --> 35:22.764
Did you see who did it?

35:22.766 --> 35:23.932
No.

35:36.778 --> 35:39.380
Please don't say
"I told you so."

35:47.823 --> 35:49.990
Let's go home.

36:07.808 --> 36:10.643
They died on the same day.

36:10.645 --> 36:14.279
They were a couple.
It was a boating accident.

36:14.281 --> 36:17.749
- There were five of them.
- How old were they?

36:17.751 --> 36:20.151
All the drowning victims
were classmates.

36:20.153 --> 36:22.220
They were seniors.

36:22.222 --> 36:26.925
Can you flip back
to the week before?

36:35.901 --> 36:40.337
( Murmuring )

36:40.339 --> 36:41.706
What?

36:41.708 --> 36:43.440
What is it?

36:45.009 --> 36:47.343
♪

36:47.345 --> 36:50.446
- Remy.
- Hey, guys?

36:50.448 --> 36:52.348
I don't think we're
alone down here.

36:57.788 --> 36:59.122
Let's get out of here.

37:18.846 --> 37:20.947
Mr. price asked me
to stay after class last week.

37:20.949 --> 37:24.450
He's "concerned" about me.

37:24.452 --> 37:27.123
He told me the two
hardest things in life

37:27.141 --> 37:28.573
are knowing what you want

37:28.575 --> 37:30.642
and being able
to say it out loud.

37:30.644 --> 37:33.779
Well, it's none
of his business.

37:33.781 --> 37:36.314
I finally figured out
what I want.

37:36.316 --> 37:40.285
I want to leave this town
and disappear from everything.

37:40.287 --> 37:42.453
You know, you never
told me this.

37:42.455 --> 37:45.757
Mom locked in a room
and you lashing out

37:45.759 --> 37:48.325
at everyone who looks
at you the wrong way?

37:48.327 --> 37:51.129
It's been easier to pretend
that I was okay.

37:51.131 --> 37:55.233
Well, you know, you can
always tell me stuff.

37:55.235 --> 37:58.135
I mean, I don't want you feeling
like you're alone in this.

37:58.137 --> 37:59.836
But I have been alone.

37:59.838 --> 38:02.939
Since dad died, you haven't
just pushed other people away.

38:02.941 --> 38:04.507
You've cut me out, too.

38:04.509 --> 38:08.211
Look, I get why you're sad,

38:08.213 --> 38:11.381
but why are you so damn mad?

38:14.117 --> 38:17.219
Same goes for you, Luke.

38:17.221 --> 38:20.022
You don't have to go
through this alone.

38:20.024 --> 38:23.793
I think mom did it.

38:30.666 --> 38:33.467
I think she killed dad.

38:41.043 --> 38:43.211
The reason why I was
at the paper tonight

38:43.213 --> 38:45.745
was because of
something my mom said.

38:45.747 --> 38:48.215
She just got back
from Afghanistan,

38:48.217 --> 38:50.517
and she doesn't understand
why she's here.

38:50.519 --> 38:52.719
Her entire troop was killed
in an ambush,

38:52.721 --> 38:54.087
and she was the sole survivor.

38:54.089 --> 38:56.489
Sounds like your mom's
a lucky woman.

38:56.491 --> 38:58.058
That's what it looks like.

38:58.060 --> 39:00.527
It must be really hard
for her. I'm sorry.

39:00.529 --> 39:03.729
I'm not telling you this story because
I want you to be sorry for me.

39:03.731 --> 39:07.166
I'm telling you this story because I
think you both might be a part of it.

39:07.168 --> 39:11.470
What... I'm not
connecting the dots.

39:11.472 --> 39:13.139
Your relatives
both died just after

39:13.141 --> 39:14.606
a Ravenswood soldier came home.

39:14.608 --> 39:16.475
Last year, I wrote
a history paper

39:16.477 --> 39:17.876
on another Ravenswood vet

39:17.878 --> 39:20.378
who miraculously
survived an ambush,

39:20.380 --> 39:22.680
and when he came home he said
exactly what my mom said.

39:22.682 --> 39:24.349
"I don't know
why I'm still here.

39:24.351 --> 39:26.384
I shouldn't be alive."

39:26.386 --> 39:28.186
Tonight I found out
that a few days later,

39:28.188 --> 39:30.655
five Ravenswood teens were
killed in a car accident.

39:30.657 --> 39:31.789
They were hit by a tree.

39:31.791 --> 39:34.358
So, the idea is these kids died

39:34.360 --> 39:36.727
because those soldiers
got lucky like your mom?

39:36.729 --> 39:39.263
I'm not saying it's because.
I'm just saying it happened.

39:39.265 --> 39:41.798
- Twice.
- Once is happenstance,

39:41.800 --> 39:44.768
twice is coincidence,
three times is enemy action.

39:44.770 --> 39:48.272
- That's profound.
- It's <i>Goldfinger.</i>

39:48.274 --> 39:50.740
- Bond?
- Heh.

39:50.742 --> 39:52.742
Hey, how much further
to that diner?

39:52.744 --> 39:54.677
I have an uneasy feeling
in my stomach.

39:54.679 --> 39:56.479
I need some greasy fries
to settle it.

39:56.481 --> 39:57.981
It's just over the river.

39:57.983 --> 40:01.050
So, I guess we're not
making that bus?

40:01.052 --> 40:02.551
No, we'll catch the next one.

40:04.988 --> 40:07.222
Guys, that's my boyfriend
and his sister.

40:07.224 --> 40:10.658
( Sighs ) Let's keep this
to ourselves.

40:10.660 --> 40:12.995
I don't even know
what "this" is.

40:24.873 --> 40:26.340
Want a lift?

40:26.342 --> 40:28.242
Gonna pour any second.

40:28.244 --> 40:29.777
What are you doing with him?

40:29.779 --> 40:32.914
I really don't want
to walk home in the rain.

40:32.916 --> 40:35.016
Fine.

40:49.830 --> 40:52.032
How was the parade?

40:53.533 --> 40:57.136
Uh, Remy, you mind
