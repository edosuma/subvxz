02:08.044 --> 02:10.756
Which came first...

02:10.881 --> 02:12.883
the chicken or the egg?

02:16.887 --> 02:19.181
Did the universe
have a beginning...

02:19.306 --> 02:22.392
and if so,
what happened before then?

02:26.772 --> 02:29.733
Where did the universe
come from...

02:29.858 --> 02:31.985
and where is it going?

03:03.767 --> 03:07.062
Luck. Luck. Well...

03:07.187 --> 03:09.773
we have been very lucky...

03:09.898 --> 03:13.026
I mean, my family
and Stephen and everybody.

03:13.151 --> 03:16.113
You have your disasters,
but the point is that we have survived.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.615
Everybody has disasters,
and yet some people disappear...

03:18.782 --> 03:20.617
and are never seen again.

03:32.963 --> 03:35.757
Flying bombs are very alarming.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.926
They came buzzing over...

03:38.051 --> 03:39.970
and then they would cut out.

03:41.805 --> 03:44.600
And when you heard the bang,
you knew it wasn't you...

03:44.725 --> 03:47.019
so you went back
to your meal or whatever.

03:47.144 --> 03:50.147
But one did fall
quite close to our house...

03:50.272 --> 03:52.691
and it blew
the back windows out...

03:52.816 --> 03:56.320
so that the glass was sticking dagger
points all out of the opposite wall.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.825
When Stephen was born,
we decided...

04:01.992 --> 04:04.369
he'd better be born
in Oxford.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.663
So while I was staying
in the hospital...

04:07.706 --> 04:10.334
I went to Blackwell's
in Oxford...

04:10.459 --> 04:13.462
and I bought
an astronomical atlas.

04:14.922 --> 04:17.382
One of my sisters-in-law said...

04:17.507 --> 04:20.344
"This is a very prophetic thing
for you to have done."

04:26.350 --> 04:28.477
How real is time?

04:29.853 --> 04:32.439
Will it ever come
to an end?

04:35.859 --> 04:37.986
Where does the difference...

04:38.111 --> 04:41.198
between the past
and the future come from?

04:43.367 --> 04:45.702
Why do we remember
the past...

04:45.869 --> 04:47.955
but not the future?

04:52.543 --> 04:54.378
I can remember the day...

04:54.545 --> 04:58.507
when we traveled through London
and the blackout was over.

05:02.344 --> 05:05.347
And the trains,
instead of being shut in...

05:05.472 --> 05:08.016
by blinds so that you
just traveled in a train...

05:08.141 --> 05:10.227
we were coming over
one of the bridges...

05:10.394 --> 05:13.730
and all the lights...
well, such lights as were left...

05:13.897 --> 05:17.192
were on in London, but it was also
a completely starry night...

05:17.317 --> 05:20.112
and you could see the light.
It was beautiful.

05:24.533 --> 05:29.079
I remember we all used to lie on the grass,
looking straight up through a telescope...

05:29.246 --> 05:32.416
and seeing the wonders
of the stars.

05:32.541 --> 05:36.086
Stephen always had
a strong sense of wonder...

05:36.253 --> 05:39.423
and I could see that
the stars would draw him...

05:39.590 --> 05:41.508
and further than the stars.

05:44.219 --> 05:47.055
I was born
exactly 300 years...

05:47.181 --> 05:49.600
after the death of Galileo.

05:52.519 --> 05:56.273
I estimate that
about 200,000 other babies...

05:56.440 --> 05:58.901
were also born that day.

06:01.278 --> 06:03.405
I don't know
whether any of them...

06:03.530 --> 06:05.782
was later interested
in astronomy.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.371
My first memory is of Isobel...

06:11.496 --> 06:14.291
pushing a rather antiquated...

06:14.416 --> 06:17.127
carriage-built pram
along North Road...

06:17.294 --> 06:19.796
with Stephen and Mary in it...

06:19.922 --> 06:22.424
sort of looking very large...

06:22.549 --> 06:26.720
because they had large heads and pink
cheeks, and they were very noticeable.

06:26.845 --> 06:30.140
They all looked different
from ordinary people.

06:32.100 --> 06:35.896
I can remember visiting
the Hawking home...

06:36.021 --> 06:37.814
oh, several times.

06:38.065 --> 06:41.693
It was the sort of place where,
if invited to stay to supper...

06:41.818 --> 06:43.862
you might, uh...

06:43.987 --> 06:46.198
be allowed to have
your conversation with Stephen...

06:46.323 --> 06:49.117
but the rest of the family
would be sitting...

06:49.243 --> 06:51.453
at the table
reading a book...

06:51.578 --> 06:55.082
a behavior which was not really
approved of in my circle...

06:55.207 --> 06:57.251
but which was tolerated
from the Hawkings...

06:57.376 --> 06:59.545
because they were
recognized to be...

06:59.670 --> 07:03.090
very eccentric,
highly intelligent...

07:03.215 --> 07:05.217
very clever people...

07:05.342 --> 07:08.011
but still a bit odd.

07:09.429 --> 07:13.475
My impression of the Hawking family
was that they were all like that...

07:13.600 --> 07:15.853
except for Stephen,
who seemed to be...

07:16.019 --> 07:18.105
the only normal member
of the family.

07:20.899 --> 07:23.485
Stephen used to reckon
he knew, I think it was...

07:23.610 --> 07:27.155
11 ways of getting into the house,
and I could only find ten.

07:28.532 --> 07:30.951
I'm not sure where the other way was.

07:32.452 --> 07:36.331
On the north side of the house
was a bicycle shed.

07:36.456 --> 07:39.960
It had a door at the front
and a door at the back.

07:40.085 --> 07:43.964
Above that, there was a window
into the L-shaped room...

07:45.507 --> 07:48.677
and at the front you could get
sort of around the corner...

07:48.802 --> 07:51.221
onto the roof...

07:51.346 --> 07:54.057
and from that level...

07:54.183 --> 07:56.226
you could get
onto the main roof.

07:57.728 --> 07:59.479
I think one of the ways...

07:59.605 --> 08:01.899
Stephen could get in
was on the main roof.

08:04.985 --> 08:08.030
As I say, he was
a much better climber than I was.

08:10.532 --> 08:13.118
I still didn't know
what the 11th one was.

08:17.247 --> 08:19.750
Before the 20th century...

08:19.875 --> 08:24.004
it was thought that the universe
had existed forever...

08:24.129 --> 08:27.758
or had been created
at some time in the past...

08:27.925 --> 08:30.761
more or less
as we observe it today.

08:32.971 --> 08:36.099
People found comfort
in the thought...

08:36.225 --> 08:39.061
that even though
they may grow old and die...

08:39.186 --> 08:42.648
the universe was eternal
and unchanging.

08:45.192 --> 08:48.779
I gave up playing games
with Stephen...

08:50.113 --> 08:53.992
oh, when he was ill that time
when he was about 12...

08:54.117 --> 08:56.870
because he started
taking games terribly seriously.

08:57.955 --> 09:00.791
We had Monopoly...

09:00.916 --> 09:02.918
and first of all...

09:03.043 --> 09:07.005
the Monopoly board sprang
railways going across it...

09:07.130 --> 09:09.299
to add to the complications...

09:09.466 --> 09:12.261
and then Monopoly
just wasn't adaptable enough.

09:12.386 --> 09:15.264
He ended up with a fearful game
called Dynasty...

09:16.390 --> 09:19.601
which, as far as I can make out...
I never played it...

09:19.726 --> 09:22.813
went on forever because
there was no way of ending it.

09:23.272 --> 09:26.817
It was almost a substitute for living,
as far as I could make out.

09:26.984 --> 09:29.486
It took hours
and hours and hours.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.947
I thought it was
a perfectly terrible game.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.825
I couldn't imagine anyone
getting taken up with that.

09:34.950 --> 09:37.744
But Stephen always had
a very complicated mind...

09:37.870 --> 09:39.705
and I felt
as much as anything...

09:39.830 --> 09:42.332
it was the complication of it
that appealed to him.

09:44.418 --> 09:47.671
When I was in high school,
I learned that light...

09:47.796 --> 09:51.175
from distant galaxies
was shifted to the red.

09:53.093 --> 09:56.513
This meant that they were
moving away from us...

09:56.638 --> 09:58.974
and that the universe
was expanding.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.519
But I didn't believe it.

10:06.023 --> 10:10.194
A static universe seemed
much more natural.

10:11.570 --> 10:13.655
It could have existed...

10:13.780 --> 10:17.034
and could continue to exist forever.

10:20.621 --> 10:23.040
We were discussing
the possibility...

10:23.165 --> 10:26.126
of the spontaneous
generation of life...

10:26.251 --> 10:29.713
and I think
that Stephen made a remark...

10:29.838 --> 10:32.132
which indicated not only
that he'd thought of this...

10:32.257 --> 10:34.676
but he'd even also...

10:34.801 --> 10:37.012
come across
some calculations...

10:37.137 --> 10:39.890
as to how long it might take.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.684
At that time,
I think I made a comment...

10:42.809 --> 10:45.395
to one of my friends,
John McClenahan...

10:45.562 --> 10:48.106
"I think that Stephen...

10:48.232 --> 10:50.651
will turn out to be
unusually capable."

10:50.776 --> 10:53.278
I don't think I put it
in quite those words...

10:53.403 --> 10:55.489
but I made
some such remark to him...

10:55.614 --> 10:58.408
and he disagreed.

10:58.534 --> 11:01.161
And so we made
a bet on the subject.

11:01.286 --> 11:03.247
In our childish way,
we bet...

11:03.372 --> 11:06.041
a bag of sweets
on the issue.

11:06.375 --> 11:10.587
And incidentally, I reckon
that my bet has come correct...

11:10.754 --> 11:12.965
and I think
I'm entitled to payment...

11:13.090 --> 11:15.843
which has not yet
been made.

11:19.096 --> 11:21.431
The expansion
of the universe...

11:21.557 --> 11:23.767
suggested the possibility...

11:23.934 --> 11:26.019
that the universe
had a beginning...

11:26.144 --> 11:28.438
at some time in the past.

11:30.399 --> 11:34.611
The point at which the universe
may have started out...

11:34.736 --> 11:37.322
became known
as the Big Bang.

11:45.080 --> 11:47.791
The first year
he was at St. Albans School...

11:47.916 --> 11:52.379
he came, I think,
third from the bottom.

11:52.504 --> 11:54.506
I said, "Well, Stephen...

11:54.631 --> 11:57.968
do you really have to be
as far down as that?"

11:58.093 --> 11:59.970
And he said, "Well...

12:00.137 --> 12:02.598
a lot of other people
didn't do much better."

12:02.723 --> 12:04.808
He was quite unconcerned.

12:06.810 --> 12:08.979
Somehow he was
always recognized...

12:09.104 --> 12:10.981
as being very bright...

12:12.149 --> 12:15.819
and in fact they gave him
the Divinity Prize one year.

12:15.944 --> 12:19.156
That was not surprising because
his father used to read him...

12:19.323 --> 12:21.366
Bible stories
from a very early age...

12:21.491 --> 12:23.660
and he knew them all
very well...

12:23.785 --> 12:26.330
and he was quite well-versed
in religious things...

12:26.497 --> 12:30.250
although I don't think he makes
a great deal of practice of it now.

12:30.584 --> 12:33.337
Everybody
used to argue theology.

12:34.671 --> 12:37.841
That's a good, safe subject.

12:37.966 --> 12:40.761
You don't need any facts or...

12:40.886 --> 12:43.347
distracting things like that.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.141
If you go in for arguing...

12:48.018 --> 12:52.314
you know, debating... you can
quite happily debate about anything...

12:52.439 --> 12:54.775
including theology...

12:54.900 --> 12:57.653
and the existence
or otherwise of God.

13:00.864 --> 13:02.866
And then someone
gets bored...

13:03.033 --> 13:06.203
or Journey Into Space comes on,
or something like that...

13:06.328 --> 13:09.289
and the argument
breaks up.

13:11.416 --> 13:13.544
In an unchanging universe...

13:13.669 --> 13:17.256
one can imagine
that God created the universe...

13:17.381 --> 13:20.884
at literally any time
in the past.

13:21.969 --> 13:24.221
On the other hand...

13:24.388 --> 13:26.723
if the universe is expanding...

13:26.890 --> 13:29.101
there may be
physical reasons...

13:29.226 --> 13:31.854
why there had to be
a beginning.

13:33.397 --> 13:37.234
An expanding universe
does not preclude a creator...

13:37.359 --> 13:39.236
but it does place limits...

13:39.361 --> 13:42.781
on when he might have
carried out his job.

13:46.910 --> 13:49.621
When the family went to India...

13:49.746 --> 13:53.250
it was arranged that Stephen should
come and live with us for a year.

13:54.418 --> 13:56.753
He decided
it would be nice...

13:56.879 --> 13:59.256
that we should have...

13:59.423 --> 14:01.800
Scottish dancing
in the evening.

14:01.925 --> 14:04.678
Mind you, this was
quite an ordinary house...

14:04.803 --> 14:07.973
but we had rather a lot of room
and a large hall...

14:08.098 --> 14:11.768
and so we bought
some records...

14:11.935 --> 14:15.814
and a book
about what to do...

14:15.939 --> 14:18.775
and Stephen took charge.

14:18.942 --> 14:22.821
And he insisted
you put on a jacket and a tie.

14:22.946 --> 14:27.451
And then he was
the master of the proceedings.

14:27.576 --> 14:29.786
And Stephen took it
very seriously.

14:29.953 --> 14:32.289
But then he liked dancing,
you see?

14:35.792 --> 14:39.129
There were
four physicists in my year...

14:39.254 --> 14:41.131
Gordon Berry...

14:41.256 --> 14:43.133
Richard Bryan...

14:43.258 --> 14:45.135
Stephen...

14:45.260 --> 14:47.095
myself.

14:48.639 --> 14:51.892
I first remember Stephen...

14:52.017 --> 14:55.854
on an occasion when Gordon and I
went up after dinner to his room...

14:55.979 --> 14:59.316
to try to find him.

14:59.483 --> 15:01.318
And Stephen
was up there...

15:01.485 --> 15:03.820
with a crate of beer...

15:03.946 --> 15:06.156
slowly drinking
his way through it.

15:07.241 --> 15:10.953
He was only 17.
He couldn't legally go into a pub.

15:11.078 --> 15:13.956
He'd gone up to Oxford
ridiculously early.

15:19.127 --> 15:22.130
We used to have
what we called a gathering net.

15:23.715 --> 15:27.427
We used to organize a beer party
and various things like that...

15:27.553 --> 15:30.722
to gather all these... collar
as many freshman as we could get...

15:30.848 --> 15:32.891
to get them to join
the Boat Club.

15:33.016 --> 15:36.186
And that's how
we collected him, you see?

15:42.860 --> 15:45.654
But the question always
with Stephen was...

15:46.738 --> 15:49.241
"Should we make him
the cox of the first eight...

15:49.366 --> 15:52.035
or the second eight?"

15:52.161 --> 15:55.664
Well, coxes can be
adventurous...

15:55.789 --> 15:59.459
and some coxes can be
very steady people.

15:59.585 --> 16:02.671
He was rather
an adventurous type.

16:04.214 --> 16:06.717
You never knew quite
what he was going to do...

16:06.884 --> 16:08.802
when he went out
with the crew.

16:13.891 --> 16:17.644
I think he used to bring his work
with him into the boat sometimes.

16:17.769 --> 16:19.980
His sort of thinking gear
was going...

16:20.105 --> 16:22.566
on different levels.

16:24.651 --> 16:29.072
We were asked
to read chapter 10...

16:29.239 --> 16:32.075
in a book called
Electricity and Magnetism...

16:32.242 --> 16:34.745
by Bleaney and Bleaney,
an unlikely combination...

16:34.912 --> 16:36.997
a husband-and-wife team...

16:37.122 --> 16:40.375
and at the end of that chapter,
there were 13 questions...

16:40.501 --> 16:44.004
all of them
final honors questions.

16:44.129 --> 16:48.467
I discovered very rapidly
that I couldn't do any of them.

16:48.592 --> 16:50.886
Richard and I worked together
for the week...

16:51.011 --> 16:53.597
and we managed to do
1 1/2 questions...

16:53.764 --> 16:55.682
which we felt very proud of.

16:55.807 --> 16:57.768
Gordon refused
all assistance...

16:57.893 --> 17:01.146
and managed to do one
all by himself.

17:01.271 --> 17:04.023
Stephen, as always,
hadn't even started...

17:04.148 --> 17:08.278
but the next morning,
he went up to his rooms at 9:00...

17:09.488 --> 17:12.824
and we came back about 12:00,
maybe five past 12:00...

17:12.950 --> 17:17.037
and down came Stephen, and we were
in the college gateway, the lodge.

17:17.162 --> 17:20.790
"Ah, Hawking," I said, "how many
have you managed to do, then?"

17:20.958 --> 17:24.795
"Well," he said, "I've only had time
to do the first ten."

17:26.128 --> 17:30.425
I think at that point we realized that
it's not just we weren't in the same street.

17:30.551 --> 17:32.636
We weren't
on the same planet.

17:36.431 --> 17:38.475
I once calculated...

17:38.600 --> 17:41.603
that I did
about 1,000 hours' work...

17:41.728 --> 17:45.148
in the three years
I was at Oxford...

17:45.315 --> 17:47.985
an average of an hour a day.

17:48.944 --> 17:51.697
I am not proud
of this lack of work.

17:51.822 --> 17:55.158
I am just describing
my attitude at the time...

17:56.451 --> 18:00.455
an attitude that nothing
was worth making an effort for.

18:04.042 --> 18:07.796
He used to produce his work
every week for tutorial...

18:07.921 --> 18:11.175
and, as he never
kept any notes...

18:11.341 --> 18:13.927
or papers
or that sort of thing...

18:14.052 --> 18:18.515
on leaving my room, he would normally
throw it in my wastepaper basket.

18:18.640 --> 18:22.853
And when he was with
other undergraduates at the tutorial...

18:23.020 --> 18:25.522
and they saw this happen,
they were absolutely horrified...

18:25.647 --> 18:29.067
'cause they thought, he did
this work in probably half an hour...

18:29.193 --> 18:33.697
If they could have done it in a year, they
wouldn't have thrown it in the wastepaper basket.

18:33.864 --> 18:36.283
They would've put it
in a frame on their walls.

18:37.951 --> 18:40.204
Because of my lack of work...

18:40.370 --> 18:43.332
I had planned
to get through the final exam...

18:43.457 --> 18:46.668
by doing problems
in theoretical physics...

18:46.793 --> 18:51.548
and avoiding any questions
that required factual knowledge.

18:53.467 --> 18:55.844
I didn't do very well.

18:57.387 --> 19:01.975
I was on the borderline between
a first- and second-class degree...

19:02.100 --> 19:06.522
and I had to be interviewed
to determine which I should get.

19:08.148 --> 19:11.318
They asked me
about my future plans.

19:12.778 --> 19:16.240
I replied,
if they gave me a first...

19:16.365 --> 19:18.534
I would go to Cambridge.

19:20.118 --> 19:22.412
If I only got a second...

19:22.579 --> 19:24.915
I would stay in Oxford.

19:26.625 --> 19:28.752
They gave me a first.

19:35.509 --> 19:38.637
I drove Stephen
and his young brother...

19:38.762 --> 19:41.181
out to Woburn Park...

19:41.306 --> 19:43.308
and he climbed a tree.

19:43.433 --> 19:46.103
He was testing himself out, I think.
I didn't realize.

19:46.228 --> 19:48.063
He did manage
to climb a tree...

19:48.188 --> 19:51.233
and go along a branch of it
and get himself down.

19:51.358 --> 19:54.820
I think he began to notice
that his hands...

19:54.945 --> 19:57.573
were less useful
than they had been...

19:57.698 --> 19:59.616
but he didn't tell us.

20:02.369 --> 20:04.872
Univ has these square staircases...

20:04.997 --> 20:07.666
which are round
but they're square.

20:07.791 --> 20:10.711
It was just coming down
from one of the rooms.

20:10.836 --> 20:14.381
Steve actually fell on the stairs
coming downstairs...

20:14.506 --> 20:17.759
and kind of bounced
all the way down to the bottom.

20:17.885 --> 20:22.222
I don't know if he lost consciousness,
but he lost his memory.

20:23.640 --> 20:27.019
We took him to either my room
or someone's room.

20:27.144 --> 20:29.605
The first question of course
was, "Who am I?"

20:29.730 --> 20:32.149
We told him,
"You're Steve Hawking."

20:32.274 --> 20:36.737
Right away he would ask again,
"Who am I?"

20:36.862 --> 20:38.614
"Steve Hawking."

20:38.739 --> 20:42.534
Then, after a couple of minutes,
he remembered he was Steve Hawking.

20:42.659 --> 20:45.871
Then we'd say, "Do you remember
going down to the bar...

20:45.996 --> 20:48.332
and having a drink
on Sunday night?"

20:48.499 --> 20:51.919
Or, "Do you remember coxing
on the river on Monday?"

20:52.044 --> 20:54.421
And his memory
came back gradually...

20:54.546 --> 20:58.133
until he could remember the previous
day's events, and then the previous hour...

20:58.258 --> 21:02.179
and by the end of the two hours,
he could remember everything.

21:02.304 --> 21:04.598
The question was,
"Well, maybe you've lost...

21:04.723 --> 21:06.683
some of your mind
because of this."

21:06.808 --> 21:10.979
And so Steve decided,
"Well, I'll take the Mensa test."

21:11.104 --> 21:13.065
We said,
"Of course you'll get in."

21:13.190 --> 21:16.777
But he came back delighted
he was able to get into Mensa.

21:16.902 --> 21:18.862
Absolutely delighted.

21:29.873 --> 21:31.959
I felt that there were two areas...

21:32.084 --> 21:34.253
of theoretical physics...

21:34.378 --> 21:36.547
I might study at Cambridge.

21:38.757 --> 21:43.136
One was cosmology,
the study of the very large.

21:45.848 --> 21:49.685
The other was
elementary particles...

21:49.810 --> 21:52.396
the study
of the very small.

21:54.064 --> 21:56.859
However, I thought
elementary particles...

21:56.984 --> 21:58.652
were less attractive...

21:58.777 --> 22:01.822
because there was
no proper theory.

22:03.115 --> 22:04.867
All they could do...

22:04.992 --> 22:08.078
was arrange
the particles in families...

22:08.245 --> 22:10.164
like in botany.

22:12.916 --> 22:15.669
In cosmology,
on the other hand...

22:15.794 --> 22:18.589
there was
a well-defined theory...

22:18.755 --> 22:22.050
Einstein's general theory
of relativity.

22:29.057 --> 22:31.268
It was a very cold year...

22:33.020 --> 22:37.691
and the ice
on Verulamium Pond...

22:37.816 --> 22:40.277
it was frozen there...

22:40.444 --> 22:43.697
and we all went skating.

22:43.822 --> 22:46.366
And Stephen managed
to skate fairly well...

22:46.492 --> 22:48.952
but then, he and I
were close together.

22:49.119 --> 22:51.163
He wasn't skating
in a very advanced way...

22:51.288 --> 22:54.166
but nor was I,
if it comes to that.

22:54.291 --> 22:56.001
He fell...

22:56.126 --> 22:58.295
and he couldn't get up.

22:59.505 --> 23:03.091
So I took him to a café
to warm up...

23:03.217 --> 23:05.719
and he told me then
all about it.

23:07.179 --> 23:09.515
And it was diagnosed.

23:10.891 --> 23:13.936
I insisted on going
to see his doctor...

23:14.061 --> 23:17.314
because it seemed to me
however long you're going to live...

23:17.481 --> 23:19.775
there's probably something
someone can do about it...

23:19.900 --> 23:22.861
at least anyhow to make
things easier for people.

23:22.986 --> 23:25.405
I won't mention
the doctor's name...

23:25.531 --> 23:29.201
but I got to see him
at the London Clinic.

23:29.326 --> 23:32.996
He was rather surprised that I should
bother to come 'round to see him.

23:33.121 --> 23:35.749
After all, I was only
Stephen's mother.

23:35.874 --> 23:39.837
He was quite nice. He agreed
to see me in a rather grand way.

23:39.962 --> 23:41.964
And he said,
"Yes, it's all very sad.

23:42.089 --> 23:44.967
Brilliant young man cut off
in the prime of his youth."

23:45.092 --> 23:47.594
But of course I said,
"What can we do?

23:47.719 --> 23:49.638
What can we do
to sort of...

23:49.763 --> 23:51.849
Can we get physiotherapy?

23:51.974 --> 23:55.185
Can we get anything like that
that will help in any way?"

23:55.352 --> 23:57.396
He said,
"Well, actually, no.

23:57.521 --> 24:00.524
There's nothing I can do, really.
More or less, that's it."

24:04.194 --> 24:07.406
Shortly after my 21st birthday...

24:07.531 --> 24:10.367
I went into hospital for tests.

24:12.661 --> 24:15.497
They took a muscle sample
from my arm...

24:15.622 --> 24:17.583
stuck electrodes into me...

24:17.708 --> 24:21.712
and injected some radiopaque
fluid into my spine...

24:21.879 --> 24:24.715
and watched it going
up and down with X-rays...

24:24.882 --> 24:27.009
as they tilted the bed.

24:29.136 --> 24:32.598
I was diagnosed
as having ALS...

24:32.723 --> 24:35.642
amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis...

24:35.767 --> 24:40.105
or motor neuron disease,
as it is also known.

24:41.690 --> 24:44.067
The doctors
could offer no cure...

24:44.234 --> 24:47.654
and gave me
2 1/2 years to live.

24:57.706 --> 25:00.918
I went into the graduates'
common room...

25:01.084 --> 25:03.754
looking, really, for someone
to have lunch with.

25:03.921 --> 25:07.132
There was nobody around that
I particularly wished to have lunch with...

25:07.257 --> 25:09.051
and then Stephen walked
through the door.

25:09.176 --> 25:12.763
I don't know what he was doing at Oxford.
I've certainly forgotten now.

25:12.888 --> 25:16.433
And so Stephen
generously went off...

25:16.558 --> 25:18.519
to buy the drinks...

25:18.644 --> 25:20.938
and brought them
and put them on the table.

25:21.063 --> 25:23.357
And as he put his pint
of beer down...

25:23.482 --> 25:25.275
he spilled it.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.611
I sort of said genially...

25:27.778 --> 25:31.073
"Oh, heavens.
Drinking at this time of day!"

25:31.198 --> 25:35.619
He then told me he'd been
in Addenbrooke's for three weeks...

25:35.786 --> 25:38.121
and they'd done
a whole series of tests...

25:38.247 --> 25:40.916
and they'd decided...

25:41.041 --> 25:42.960
what was wrong with him.

25:43.085 --> 25:47.005
And he told me
very straight and flat...

25:47.130 --> 25:49.716
that he was gradually
going to lose...

25:49.842 --> 25:52.386
the use of his body...

25:52.511 --> 25:54.888
that eventually...

25:55.013 --> 25:58.141
only his heart and his lungs...

25:58.308 --> 26:01.687
would still be operating,
and his brain...

26:01.812 --> 26:03.897
and that
they'd told him that...

26:04.022 --> 26:08.277
eventually he would essentially
have the body of a cabbage...

26:08.402 --> 26:11.780
but his mind would still be
in perfect working order...

26:11.905 --> 26:15.492
and he would be unable to communicate
with the rest of the world.

26:18.829 --> 26:22.040
My dreams at that time
were rather disturbed.

26:24.126 --> 26:27.004
Before my condition
had been diagnosed...

26:27.129 --> 26:29.840
I had been
very bored with life.

26:31.592 --> 26:35.179
There had not seemed to be
anything worth doing.

26:37.389 --> 26:40.350
But shortly after
I came out of hospital...

26:40.517 --> 26:44.104
I dreamt that I was
going to be executed.

26:45.355 --> 26:48.984
I suddenly realized there were
a lot of worthwhile things...

26:49.109 --> 26:52.029
I could do
if I were reprieved.

26:58.702 --> 27:03.040
I knew perfectly well
that he had no faith...

27:03.165 --> 27:04.833
and...

27:05.876 --> 27:08.337
to me, that made it
the more difficult...

27:08.462 --> 27:11.215
because you must ask yourself,
"Why me?

27:11.381 --> 27:14.551
Why this? Why now?"

27:14.718 --> 27:18.138
But he just totally,
flatly accepted...

27:18.263 --> 27:20.807
that this was what was going
to happen to him.

27:20.933 --> 27:24.978
As far as I can gather, at that point
he started to do some work.

27:26.897 --> 27:29.775
At first, there did not
seem much point...

27:29.900 --> 27:31.944
in working at my research...

27:32.069 --> 27:34.821
because I didn't expect
to live long enough...

27:34.947 --> 27:37.908
to finish my PhD.

27:39.117 --> 27:41.662
However, as time went by...

27:41.787 --> 27:44.248
the disease
seemed to slow down.

27:46.250 --> 27:49.586
I began to understand
general relativity...

27:49.753 --> 27:52.005
and made progress
with my work.

27:54.174 --> 27:56.718
But what really made
a difference was...

27:56.844 --> 28:01.098
I had got engaged
to a girl called Jane Wilde.

28:02.724 --> 28:05.602
This gave me
something to live for...

28:05.769 --> 28:08.605
but it also meant
I had to get a job...

28:08.772 --> 28:11.024
if we were to get married.

28:13.068 --> 28:16.446
Stephen was already ill.
Jane knew it.

28:16.572 --> 28:20.409
And it was another instance
of Stephen's luck, you know...

28:20.534 --> 28:23.245
meeting the right person
at the right time...

28:23.370 --> 28:28.542
because Stephen was
very, very badly depressed...

28:28.667 --> 28:32.171
and he wasn't very much inclined
to go on with his work.

28:32.296 --> 28:34.631
He'd been told
he's only got 2 1/2 years.

28:34.756 --> 28:36.800
What can you do
in that time?

28:36.967 --> 28:40.679
But meeting Jane really
put him on his mettle...

28:40.804 --> 28:42.806
and he started to work.

28:45.601 --> 28:47.686
I wanted to understand...

28:47.811 --> 28:49.813
how the universe began.

28:52.065 --> 28:54.943
Einstein's theory
of general relativity...

28:55.068 --> 28:57.946
showed that the universe
was expanding.

28:59.490 --> 29:02.993
But there was no answer
to the crucial question...

29:03.160 --> 29:05.704
"Must there have been
a Big Bang...

29:05.829 --> 29:07.789
a beginning to time?"

29:09.833 --> 29:12.961
Then, in my third year
at Cambridge...

29:13.086 --> 29:15.714
Roger Penrose made
his discovery...

29:15.839 --> 29:18.467
about the death of stars.

29:19.927 --> 29:23.680
I remember talking to this friend,
Ivor Robinson...

29:23.805 --> 29:27.142
and we were having
this animated conversation...

29:27.267 --> 29:30.479
and then we had
to cross a road...

29:30.604 --> 29:33.524
and as we crossed the road,
of course, the conversation stopped...

29:33.649 --> 29:35.651
and then we got
to the other side.

29:35.776 --> 29:38.403
Evidently, I had some idea
crossing the road...

29:38.529 --> 29:42.533
but then the conversation started up,
and it got completely blotted out of my mind.

29:42.658 --> 29:46.703
It was only later,
after my friend had gone home...

29:46.829 --> 29:51.291
and I began to have
this strange feeling of elation...

29:51.416 --> 29:53.252
feeling wonderful.

29:53.377 --> 29:57.714
I couldn't figure out why I should feel
like that, so I went back over the day...

29:57.840 --> 30:01.051
thinking all possible things which might
have contributed to such a feeling...

30:01.176 --> 30:04.054
and then gradually
I unearthed this thought...

30:04.179 --> 30:06.181
which I'd had
while crossing the street.

30:06.598 --> 30:09.393
Penrose announced
this result...

30:09.560 --> 30:12.271
that when stars
collapse indefinitely...

30:12.396 --> 30:14.439
they will become singular...

30:14.565 --> 30:17.943
as long as some
very broad conditions are satisfied...

30:18.068 --> 30:20.821
that everybody would have
regarded as reasonable.

30:20.946 --> 30:23.615
And I remember Stephen Hawking,
who was then approaching...

30:23.740 --> 30:26.201
his third year
as a research student, saying...

30:26.326 --> 30:28.412
"What very interesting results.

30:28.579 --> 30:30.706
I wonder whether
they could be adapted...

30:30.831 --> 30:33.625
to understanding
the origin of the universe."

30:33.750 --> 30:37.296
And what he had in mind, you see,
was that if, just mentally...

30:37.421 --> 30:39.464
you reverse
the sense of time...

30:39.590 --> 30:42.801
you can think of the expanding
universe as a collapsing system.

30:42.926 --> 30:45.888
It's a bit like
a very giant star collapsing.

30:47.097 --> 30:49.057
Roger Penrose proved...

30:49.183 --> 30:53.395
that a dying star,
collapsing under its own gravity...

30:53.520 --> 30:57.191
eventually shrinks
to a singularity...

30:57.316 --> 31:01.778
a point of infinite density
and zero size.

31:04.615 --> 31:08.452
I realized that if I reversed
the direction of time...

31:08.577 --> 31:11.622
so that the collapse
became an expansion...

31:11.747 --> 31:13.582
I could prove that...

31:13.707 --> 31:15.792
the universe had a beginning.

31:19.505 --> 31:21.381
But my proof...

31:21.507 --> 31:25.135
based on Einstein's theory
of general relativity...

31:25.260 --> 31:28.639
also showed that
we cannot understand...

31:28.764 --> 31:31.141
how the universe began...

31:32.309 --> 31:36.438
because it showed
that all scientific theories...

31:36.563 --> 31:39.983
including
general relativity itself...

31:40.108 --> 31:43.737
break down
at the beginning of the universe.

31:55.332 --> 31:57.167
We had this meeting...

31:57.334 --> 32:00.337
at the Institute of Space Physics
in New York.

32:00.462 --> 32:03.382
I said, "Before we reach
a final conclusion...

32:03.507 --> 32:06.218
we ought
to throw into the pot...

32:06.343 --> 32:08.387
still another object...

32:08.512 --> 32:12.766
a gravitationally
completely collapsed object.

32:12.891 --> 32:15.018
Well, after you've used
the phrase...

32:15.143 --> 32:19.690
"a gravitationally completely
collapsed object" ten times...

32:19.815 --> 32:22.901
you conclude you've got
to get a better name.

32:23.026 --> 32:25.154
So that's when I switched...

32:25.279 --> 32:27.531
to the word "black hole".

32:27.990 --> 32:31.410
The word "black hole," which John
Wheeler coined, suddenly caught on.

32:31.535 --> 32:34.788
Everybody adopted it,
and from then on...

32:34.913 --> 32:37.749
people around the world...
in Moscow...

32:37.875 --> 32:40.335
in America...

32:40.460 --> 32:42.337
in England and elsewhere...

32:42.462 --> 32:45.340
could know they were speaking
about the same thing.

32:45.465 --> 32:48.552
And not only that,
but suddenly...

32:48.677 --> 32:51.430
the whole range of concepts
got through to the general public...

32:51.555 --> 32:54.474
and even science-fiction writers
all of a sudden...

32:54.600 --> 32:56.560
could talk about it.

32:58.061 --> 33:00.480
Tonight, my friends...

33:00.606 --> 33:04.276
we stand on the brink
of a feat unparalleled...

33:04.401 --> 33:06.445
in space exploration.

33:07.613 --> 33:09.740
If the data
on my returning probe ship...

33:09.907 --> 33:12.284
matches my computerized
calculations...

33:12.409 --> 33:16.038
I will travel where no man
has dared to go.

33:17.247 --> 33:19.541
Into the black hole?

33:19.666 --> 33:21.251
In...

33:22.419 --> 33:24.087
through...

33:25.380 --> 33:27.257
and beyond.

33:29.009 --> 33:31.136
Why, that's crazy!

33:31.261 --> 33:33.764
Ha! Impossible!

33:36.433 --> 33:38.936
As a massive star contracts...

33:39.061 --> 33:41.480
its gravity becomes so strong...

33:41.605 --> 33:44.441
that light can no longer escape.

33:46.360 --> 33:49.571
The region from which
nothing can escape...

33:49.696 --> 33:52.115
is called a black hole...

33:52.241 --> 33:55.536
and its boundary is called
the event horizon.

33:58.247 --> 34:00.958
One might say
of the event horizon...

34:01.124 --> 34:04.044
what Dante said
of the entrance to hell...

34:05.587 --> 34:09.216
"Abandon all hope,
ye who enter here."

34:13.762 --> 34:16.139
I was once asked
to actually...

34:16.306 --> 34:18.475
be an adjudicator...

34:18.641 --> 34:22.478
on an essay
of which the subject was...

34:22.603 --> 34:25.315
"How to fall through
a black hole and live."

34:25.440 --> 34:28.527
Now, the problem I had
was that I wouldn't know...

34:28.652 --> 34:30.654
how to give out the prize...

34:30.821 --> 34:34.158
because if I said,
"That looks like a good essay"...

34:34.283 --> 34:37.161
the only real way
of showing this was right...

34:37.327 --> 34:41.248
was to actually follow it,
to do the experiment and fall in.

34:41.373 --> 34:43.333
But then,
having fallen in...

34:43.500 --> 34:46.587
I would assume taking the person
who wrote the essay with you...

34:46.712 --> 34:49.922
the question would be,
how do you tell the rest of the world?

34:50.047 --> 34:52.634
Do you take the prize in
that you give to them...

34:52.759 --> 34:55.429
and what do they do with it
when they get to the center?

34:56.513 --> 34:58.640
Believe me...

34:58.765 --> 35:01.685
I've been waiting a long time
for someone like you...

35:01.810 --> 35:03.687
to record this moment.

35:03.812 --> 35:06.440
Thank you, Doctor.

35:06.565 --> 35:08.275
Then I'm ready.

35:09.693 --> 35:13.405
Ready to embark
on man's greatest journey.

35:13.530 --> 35:15.741
Certainly his riskiest.

35:15.866 --> 35:18.869
The risk is incidental
compared to...

35:18.994 --> 35:23.081
the possibility to possess
the great truth of the unknown.

35:23.207 --> 35:25.375
There...

35:25.501 --> 35:28.378
long-cherished
laws of nature...

35:28.545 --> 35:30.672
simply do not apply.

35:30.797 --> 35:32.466
They vanish.

35:33.550 --> 35:35.719
And life?

35:37.179 --> 35:38.847
Life?

35:41.558 --> 35:43.477
Life forever.

36:08.252 --> 36:10.712
If you were watching an astronaut...

36:10.838 --> 36:14.007
foolhardy enough
to jump into a black hole...

36:14.132 --> 36:16.677
at some time
on his watch...

36:16.802 --> 36:18.846
say, 12:00...

36:18.971 --> 36:21.598
he would cross
the event horizon...

36:21.723 --> 36:23.976
and enter the black hole.

36:25.727 --> 36:28.605
But no matter
how long you waited...

36:28.730 --> 36:33.443
you would never see
the astronaut's watch reach 12:00.

36:34.778 --> 36:37.114
Instead, each second
on the watch...

36:37.281 --> 36:40.033
would appear to take
longer and longer...

36:40.159 --> 36:42.828
until the last second
before midnight...

36:42.953 --> 36:45.080
would take forever.

36:46.665 --> 36:49.626
Thus, by jumping
into a black hole...

36:49.793 --> 36:53.463
one could ensure that
one's image lasted forever.

36:55.132 --> 36:57.885
But the picture
would fade very rapidly...

36:58.010 --> 37:01.972
and grow so dim
that no one could see it.

37:05.893 --> 37:08.437
As somebody disappears
into a black hole...

37:08.562 --> 37:11.481
as seen from the outside,
it looks as though...

37:11.648 --> 37:15.652
time actually slows down,
and the person who's moving...

37:15.819 --> 37:18.155
at least he's thinking
he's moving...

37:18.280 --> 37:21.116
he's perhaps talking
in his spaceship at a normal rate...

37:21.241 --> 37:24.161
seems to slow down
and ends up being frozen...

37:24.328 --> 37:26.997
in a particular position...

37:27.122 --> 37:29.875
as seen by somebody
watching him from the outside.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.295
And as seen from the outside,
you never see what happens after that.

37:40.010 --> 37:43.222
The astronaut
wouldn't notice anything special...

37:43.347 --> 37:46.433
when his watch
reached midnight...

37:46.558 --> 37:49.102
and he crossed
the event horizon...

37:49.228 --> 37:51.271
into the black hole...

37:53.023 --> 37:57.194
until, of course,
he approached the singularity...

37:57.319 --> 37:59.696
and was crushed
into spaghetti.

38:06.787 --> 38:09.122
One can fall
through this event horizon...

38:09.248 --> 38:12.042
without feeling anything,
without noticing it.

38:12.167 --> 38:15.587
After about a week of falling,
one begins to feel the pinch...

38:15.712 --> 38:18.382
and one extends
longer and longer...

38:18.507 --> 38:20.676
and gets slightly thinner.

38:20.801 --> 38:24.429
And, of course,
one begins to get squeezed...

38:24.555 --> 38:27.558
until one gets
very long and very thin...

38:27.724 --> 38:29.893
and rather nasty.

38:30.018 --> 38:34.314
By the end of two weeks, one's fallen right
into the center and is, of course, dead.

38:35.065 --> 38:37.901
Before you lose sight
of the outer world...

38:38.026 --> 38:41.196
you would see things happening
and see them at a greater rate...

38:41.321 --> 38:43.907
so that it would look like
a firework display.

38:44.324 --> 38:47.411
The frustration would be that,
although you would be able to see...

38:47.536 --> 38:50.581
everything that happens in the future,
it would be going so fast...

38:50.747 --> 38:54.251
that from a scientific point of view,
you'd have no time to analyze it.

38:54.376 --> 38:56.420
You wouldn't be able
to take it in.

38:56.545 --> 38:58.714
Eventually things
would be going off so fast...

38:58.839 --> 39:01.633
and it would be so explosive
that you yourself would be...

39:01.758 --> 39:05.220
destroyed by the explosion,
and that would be the end.

39:05.345 --> 39:09.099
But it would be a very exciting way
to end one's life.

39:09.266 --> 39:12.644
It would be the way
I would choose if I had the choice.

39:15.939 --> 39:18.734
In the long history of the universe...

39:18.859 --> 39:22.529
many stars must have burned up
their nuclear fuel...

39:22.654 --> 39:25.115
and collapsed in
on themselves.

39:27.242 --> 39:30.162
The number of black holes
may be greater...

39:30.287 --> 39:32.664
than the number
of visible stars...

39:32.789 --> 39:35.375
which totals about
a hundred thousand million...

39:35.501 --> 39:37.461
in our galaxy alone.

39:39.963 --> 39:42.132
We also have evidence...

39:42.257 --> 39:45.219
that there is
a very large black hole...

39:45.344 --> 39:48.305
at the center
of our own galaxy.

39:54.937 --> 39:58.232
Friends ask me,
"Well, if a black hole is black...

39:58.357 --> 40:00.359
how can you see it?"

40:00.484 --> 40:04.112
And I say,
"Have you ever been to a ball?

40:04.238 --> 40:06.573
Have you ever watched
the young men...

40:06.698 --> 40:10.202
dressed in their black
evening tuxedos...

40:10.327 --> 40:12.496
and the girls
in their white dresses...

40:12.621 --> 40:15.666
whirling around,
held in each other's arms...

40:15.791 --> 40:17.793
and the lights turned low...

40:17.918 --> 40:20.504
and all you can see
is the girls?

40:20.629 --> 40:23.549
Well, the girl is
the ordinary star...

40:23.674 --> 40:26.593
and the boy
is the black hole.

40:26.718 --> 40:30.806
You can't see the black hole
any more than you can see the boy...

40:30.931 --> 40:34.643
but the girl going around
gives you convincing evidence...

40:34.768 --> 40:38.689
there must be something there
holding her in orbit."

40:40.983 --> 40:45.696
One evening, shortly after
the birth of my daughter, Lucy...

40:45.863 --> 40:48.657
I started to think
about black holes...

40:48.782 --> 40:50.868
as I was getting into bed.

40:53.453 --> 40:57.332
My disability makes this
rather a slow process...

40:57.457 --> 41:00.669
so I had plenty of time.

41:00.794 --> 41:03.672
Suddenly I realized...

41:03.797 --> 41:06.300
that the area
of the event horizon...

41:06.425 --> 41:09.094
must always increase with time.

41:11.430 --> 41:14.933
The increase in the area
of the event horizon...

41:15.058 --> 41:18.228
was very reminiscent
of a quantity called entropy...

41:18.395 --> 41:22.107
which measures the degree
of disorder of a system.

41:23.317 --> 41:25.944
It is a matter
of common experience...

41:26.069 --> 41:29.323
that disorder tends
to increase with time...

41:29.448 --> 41:32.117
if things are left
to themselves.

41:35.871 --> 41:40.292
Jacob Bekenstein
came into the office one day.

41:40.417 --> 41:42.544
"Jacob," I said...

41:42.669 --> 41:44.713
"It always troubles me...

41:44.838 --> 41:48.050
when I put a hot teacup
next to a cold teacup.

41:48.175 --> 41:51.678
I've increased, by letting heat
flow from one to the other...

41:51.803 --> 41:54.056
the amount of disorder
in the universe.

41:54.181 --> 41:57.726
But Jacob,
if a black hole swims by...

41:57.851 --> 42:01.230
and I drop
both teacups into this...

42:01.355 --> 42:04.900
I've concealed the evidence
of my crime, have I not?"

42:06.902 --> 42:10.072
Bekenstein's a man
of great integrity...

42:10.197 --> 42:13.492
and he looked troubled,
and he came back to me later...

42:13.617 --> 42:15.911
and he said,
"No, you have not...

42:16.036 --> 42:18.747
concealed the evidence
of your crime.

42:18.872 --> 42:22.417
The black hole records
what's happened to you."

42:22.543 --> 42:26.338
Stephen Hawking
read the paper...

42:26.463 --> 42:29.967
in which Bekenstein
announced this result...

42:30.092 --> 42:32.094
thought it was preposterous...

42:32.219 --> 42:34.805
and decided to prove
it was wrong.

42:38.809 --> 42:42.646
My discoveries led
Jacob Bekenstein to suggest...

42:42.813 --> 42:44.940
that the area
of the event horizon...

42:45.065 --> 42:49.319
actually was the entropy
of a black hole.

42:50.612 --> 42:52.823
But there was one fatal flaw...

42:52.948 --> 42:55.159
in Bekenstein's idea:

42:56.577 --> 42:58.996
If black holes
have an entropy...

42:59.163 --> 43:01.665
they ought to have
a temperature.

43:04.001 --> 43:06.086
And if they have
a temperature...

43:06.211 --> 43:08.797
they ought
to give off radiation.

43:10.883 --> 43:13.343
But how could they
give off radiation...

43:13.468 --> 43:16.722
if nothing can escape
from a black hole?

43:20.726 --> 43:22.477
As it turned out...

43:22.603 --> 43:25.189
Bekenstein
was basically correct...

43:25.314 --> 43:28.192
though in a manner
far more surprising...

43:28.358 --> 43:32.154
than he or anyone else
had expected.

43:36.283 --> 43:39.286
As he gradually lost
the use of his hands...

43:39.411 --> 43:44.041
he had to start developing...

43:44.208 --> 43:47.044
carefully choosing
research projects...

43:47.169 --> 43:50.380
that could be tackled
and solved...

43:50.547 --> 43:54.801
through geometrical arguments
that he could do pictorially in his head.

43:54.927 --> 43:59.348
And he developed a very powerful
set of tools nobody else really had.

43:59.640 --> 44:03.268
So in some sense,
when you lose one set of tools...

44:03.393 --> 44:05.771
you may develop other tools,
but the new tools...

44:05.896 --> 44:08.774
are amenable to different kinds
of problems than the old tools.

44:08.899 --> 44:12.194
And if you're the only master
in the world of these new tools...

44:12.319 --> 44:15.739
that means certain kinds of problems
you can solve and nobody else can.

44:17.574 --> 44:20.577
My work up to 1973...

44:20.744 --> 44:22.996
was in general relativity...

44:23.121 --> 44:27.334
and was summarized in a book
I wrote with George Ellis called...

44:27.459 --> 44:30.379
The Large Scale Structure
of Space-Time.

44:33.006 --> 44:37.219
Even then, it was difficult
for me to write things down...

44:38.971 --> 44:42.516
so I tended to think
in pictures and diagrams...

44:42.641 --> 44:45.102
that I could visualize
in my head.

45:20.053 --> 45:22.514
I remember
visiting Stephen and Jane...

45:22.639 --> 45:24.850
at their home in Cambridge.

45:24.975 --> 45:27.936
After supper in the evening...

45:28.061 --> 45:31.231
when it was time
for Stephen to go to bed...

45:31.356 --> 45:35.068
Jane insisted and Stephen acquiesced...
I guess this was standard...

45:35.194 --> 45:37.154
that Stephen
make his way up...

45:37.321 --> 45:40.574
I've forgotten whether it was
one flight of stairs or two... alone...

45:40.699 --> 45:43.494
and this was a period
when he could no longer walk.

45:43.660 --> 45:47.289
The way he got up the stairs was,
he grabbed hold of the pillars...

45:47.414 --> 45:50.501
that support the banister
and pulled him up with the strength...

45:50.626 --> 45:53.629
pulled himself up the stairs
with the strength of his own arms...

45:53.754 --> 45:55.672
dragging himself up...

45:55.797 --> 45:58.509
from the ground floor
up to the second story...

45:58.675 --> 46:02.346
in a long, arduous effort.

46:02.471 --> 46:05.265
Jane explained that...

46:05.390 --> 46:08.060
this was an important part
of his physical therapy...

46:08.185 --> 46:12.272
to maintain
his coordination...

46:12.397 --> 46:15.818
and strength
as long as possible.

46:15.943 --> 46:18.445
At first it was
sort of heartrending...

46:18.570 --> 46:22.199
to watch what appeared to be
the agony of pulling himself up the stairs...

46:22.324 --> 46:26.036
until I understood
it's just part of life...

46:26.203 --> 46:28.622
pulling himself up
the stairs like that.

46:32.793 --> 46:35.712
General relativity
is what is called...

46:35.838 --> 46:37.756
a classical theory.

46:39.550 --> 46:42.052
It predicts
a single definite path...

46:42.219 --> 46:44.137
for each particle.

46:45.806 --> 46:48.308
But according
to quantum mechanics...

46:48.433 --> 46:51.728
there is an element
of chance or uncertainty.

46:53.814 --> 46:56.900
A particle does not have...

46:57.025 --> 47:01.405
just a single path
through space and time.

47:02.281 --> 47:05.742
Instead, there is
an uncertainty principle...

47:05.909 --> 47:09.079
according to which
both the exact position...

47:09.204 --> 47:13.041
and velocity of a particle
can never be known.

47:19.506 --> 47:22.134
I began investigating...

47:22.259 --> 47:25.262
the effect quantum mechanics
might have...

47:25.387 --> 47:28.724
on particles
near a black hole.

47:28.849 --> 47:31.727
I found that particles
could escape...

47:31.852 --> 47:33.896
from a black hole...

47:34.021 --> 47:38.066
that black holes
are not completely black.

47:38.192 --> 47:41.403
At first I didn't believe it.

47:42.613 --> 47:45.657
But when I redid
the calculations...

47:45.782 --> 47:49.745
I couldn't get
the effect to go away.

47:49.870 --> 47:53.707
I met Martin Rees, and he was
shaking with excitement...

47:53.832 --> 47:56.168
and he said, "Have you heard?
Have you heard...

47:56.293 --> 47:58.003
what Stephen has discovered?

47:58.128 --> 47:59.963
Everything is different!
Everything is changed!"

48:00.088 --> 48:03.634
I was still unsure of my discovery...

48:03.759 --> 48:06.970
so I only told
a few colleagues...

48:07.095 --> 48:10.724
but word soon spread.

48:10.849 --> 48:14.269
Roger Penrose
phoned up on my birthday.

48:15.521 --> 48:18.982
He was very excited
and went on so long...

48:19.149 --> 48:22.486
that my birthday dinner
got quite cold.

48:24.154 --> 48:27.616
It was a great pity,
because it was goose...

48:27.741 --> 48:30.911
which I'm very fond of.

48:31.036 --> 48:34.790
To me it's a miracle, 'cause it's
a complicated and messy calculation.

48:34.915 --> 48:37.835
We can now do these things
very much better...

48:37.960 --> 48:40.212
and it's more transparent
what happens.

48:40.337 --> 48:43.507
But out of this messy calculation,
he showed that black holes...

48:43.632 --> 48:45.926
aren't black with this
quantum mechanical effect.

48:46.051 --> 48:48.178
There was
a residual radiation.

48:48.345 --> 48:50.347
Stephen came to a meeting...

48:50.472 --> 48:52.057
and people
were flabbergasted.

48:52.182 --> 48:54.685
I remember someone saying,
"You must be wrong, Stephen.

48:54.852 --> 48:56.687
I don't believe a word of it."

48:57.020 --> 48:59.606
I once said
that I was unhappy...

48:59.731 --> 49:03.861
with the explanation given in terms
of negative energy particles being created.

49:04.153 --> 49:07.030
But I feel this is part
of the controversy of science.

49:07.197 --> 49:11.201
You must have the give and take,
and I'm delighted to be a part of that.

49:11.368 --> 49:13.370
That's what makes it fun.

49:13.495 --> 49:16.206
If you all sat down and said,
"Oh, lovely"...

49:16.331 --> 49:18.709
when you do have
niggling questions in your mind...

49:18.876 --> 49:21.003
that's not doing
a service to science.

49:21.128 --> 49:24.047
But I was not antagonistic
to it in any way...

49:24.214 --> 49:27.384
except for that one time
when I questioned.

49:29.052 --> 49:31.138
I finally convinced myself...

49:31.263 --> 49:33.223
that black holes radiate...

49:33.348 --> 49:37.019
when I found a mechanism
through which this could happen.

49:38.395 --> 49:41.398
According
to quantum mechanics...

49:41.523 --> 49:44.443
space is filled
with virtual particles...

49:44.568 --> 49:46.445
and antiparticles...

49:46.570 --> 49:49.698
that are constantly
materializing in pairs...

49:49.823 --> 49:52.910
separating,
coming together again...

49:53.076 --> 49:55.329
and annihilating each other.

49:58.499 --> 50:01.084
In the presence
of a black hole...

50:01.251 --> 50:04.046
one member of a pair
of virtual particles...

50:04.171 --> 50:06.131
may fall into the hole...

50:06.256 --> 50:08.842
leaving the other member
without a partner...

50:08.967 --> 50:11.136
with which to annihilate.

50:12.679 --> 50:16.517
The forsaken particle
appears to be radiation...

50:16.642 --> 50:18.852
emitted by the black hole.

50:23.106 --> 50:26.985
And so black holes
are not eternal.

50:29.571 --> 50:32.950
They evaporate away
at an increasing rate...

50:33.075 --> 50:37.079
until they vanish
in a gigantic explosion.

50:40.207 --> 50:44.545
Quantum mechanics has allowed
particles and radiation...

50:44.670 --> 50:47.714
to escape
from the ultimate prison...

50:47.840 --> 50:50.217
a black hole.

50:52.302 --> 50:55.597
Einstein never accepted
quantum mechanics...

50:55.722 --> 50:59.101
because of its element
of chance and uncertainty.

51:00.644 --> 51:04.439
He said,
"God does not play dice."

51:05.774 --> 51:09.486
It seems that Einstein
was doubly wrong.

51:12.197 --> 51:14.867
The quantum effects
of black holes...

51:14.992 --> 51:18.537
suggest that not only
does God play dice...

51:18.662 --> 51:20.664
he sometimes throws them...

51:20.831 --> 51:23.000
where they cannot be seen.

51:24.626 --> 51:26.879
He says himself...

51:27.004 --> 51:28.922
that, uh...

51:29.047 --> 51:32.593
he wouldn't have got to where he is
if he hadn't been ill.

51:32.718 --> 51:34.595
And I think
that's quite possible...

51:34.720 --> 51:37.055
because
it's like Johnson said:

51:37.181 --> 51:39.766
The knowledge you're to be
hanged in the morning...

51:39.892 --> 51:41.768
concentrates
the mind wonderfully.

51:41.894 --> 51:44.188
And he has concentrated
on this in a way...

51:44.354 --> 51:47.357
I don't think he would have,
because he took a great interest...

51:47.524 --> 51:49.359
in a lot of things in life...

51:49.485 --> 51:52.529
and I don't know that he'd have
applied himself the same way...

51:52.654 --> 51:56.909
if he'd been able to get around
as he used to do, so in a way...

51:57.034 --> 52:00.704
No, I can't think anyone's lucky
having an illness like that, even so.

52:00.829 --> 52:05.375
But it's less bad luck for him
than it would be for some people...

52:05.501 --> 52:08.545
because he can so much
live in his head.

52:08.962 --> 52:11.965
When I lived with the Hawking family,
I would usually get up...

52:12.090 --> 52:14.885
around 7:15 or 7:30
and take a shower...

52:15.010 --> 52:18.013
and then read in my Bible some
in the morning and pray...

52:18.138 --> 52:20.933
and then go down at 8:15
to get Stephen up.

52:21.058 --> 52:25.062
And at breakfast I would often tell him
what I'd been reading in the Bible...

52:25.229 --> 52:28.774
hoping that this would eventually
have some influence.

52:28.899 --> 52:31.443
So then
we would go into work...

52:31.568 --> 52:35.155
and usually we'd go in and see
if there were any scientific papers...

52:35.280 --> 52:37.282
that people sent out.

52:37.407 --> 52:41.787
I did discover that despite Hawking's
great brilliance, he does read quite slowly.

52:41.912 --> 52:44.706
I could read
about twice as fast as he.

52:44.832 --> 52:48.085
But of course he would have
to read to remember it...

52:48.252 --> 52:52.047
because it would be very difficult
for him to go back and access the thing...

52:52.172 --> 52:54.925
whereas I could skim the paper
rather quickly and see...

52:55.050 --> 52:56.760
"Is there something
interesting in this?"

52:56.885 --> 53:01.098
If I wanted to work on it,
I could pick the thing up and look at it.

53:02.182 --> 53:04.476
Black hole radiation...

53:04.601 --> 53:07.771
has shown us
that gravitational collapse...

53:07.938 --> 53:10.774
is not as final
as we once thought.

53:12.693 --> 53:15.988
If an astronaut falls
into a black hole...

53:16.113 --> 53:19.491
he will be returned
to the rest of the universe...

53:19.616 --> 53:22.452
in the form of radiation.

53:23.620 --> 53:25.455
Thus, in a sense...

53:25.581 --> 53:28.041
the astronaut will be recycled.

53:30.335 --> 53:34.381
However, it would be
a poor sort of immortality...

53:34.506 --> 53:37.551
because any personal
concept of time...

53:37.676 --> 53:41.013
would come to an end
as he is torn apart...

53:41.138 --> 53:43.098
inside the black hole.

53:46.351 --> 53:48.228
All that would survive...

53:48.353 --> 53:51.148
would be his mass,
or energy.

53:56.820 --> 53:59.156
One year,
the Hawkings took me along...

53:59.281 --> 54:02.117
when we went
to a cottage in Wales...

54:02.242 --> 54:03.785
near the River Wye...

54:03.911 --> 54:06.330
and this cottage
was up a hill...

54:06.455 --> 54:09.750
and there was a bit of...

54:09.875 --> 54:13.337
a paved little sidewalk
that went up to the cottage...

54:13.504 --> 54:16.048
which I had not been up,
and of course...

54:16.173 --> 54:19.843
I wanted to do it in the least
number of trips I could imagine...

54:19.968 --> 54:22.137
so we put Stephen's batteries
under his chair...

54:22.262 --> 54:25.349
his wheelchair has space for batteries...
and put extra batteries under there...

54:25.516 --> 54:27.809
which Stephen didn't realize
that I'd put under there...

54:27.935 --> 54:30.437
so he didn't realize his wheelchair
was as heavily laden.

54:30.854 --> 54:34.650
Stephen got quite a bit ahead of me,
and he was turning the corner...

54:34.775 --> 54:37.861
to go around to his house,
but that was on a slope...

54:38.028 --> 54:41.782
so I looked up, and I noticed Stephen's
wheelchair slowly tipping backward.

54:41.907 --> 54:45.702
Of course,
I was about ten meters away...

54:45.869 --> 54:49.373
and tried to run up there,
but I was not able to get there...

54:49.498 --> 54:53.043
rapidly enough before he toppled
backward into the bushes.

54:53.168 --> 54:55.963
So it was
a bit of a shocking sight...

54:56.088 --> 54:58.382
to see this master of gravity
getting overcome...

54:58.507 --> 55:01.385
by the weak gravitational
force of Earth.

55:02.302 --> 55:06.640
One of the worst things for me would be
having people there all the time.

55:06.765 --> 55:09.017
Never alone.
I couldn't bear that.

55:09.142 --> 55:12.396
And yet he finds
things funny...

55:12.521 --> 55:16.275
and he enjoys life and he goes
dashing about all over the place...

55:16.400 --> 55:18.235
and I think
this is tremendous.

55:18.402 --> 55:20.779
But it's a sort of courage
I haven't got...

55:20.904 --> 55:24.658
and his father hadn't got it,
and we cannot but admire it...

55:24.783 --> 55:27.995
but wonder how on earth
he got it, really.

55:28.328 --> 55:30.455
There must have been
50 people there...

55:30.581 --> 55:33.333
and I was standing off
in a corner...

55:33.458 --> 55:36.628
sort of watching quietly...

55:36.753 --> 55:38.755
for a few minutes, relaxing...

55:38.922 --> 55:41.633
and Stephen was over there,
not far from me.

55:41.758 --> 55:44.052
Jane walked over to Stephen
and looked at him.

55:44.178 --> 55:46.680
He was sitting there
with his head in his lap...

55:46.805 --> 55:49.433
like only Stephen can put
his head in his lap.

55:49.558 --> 55:52.019
And Jane said to Stephen...

55:52.144 --> 55:55.272
"You look miserable, Stephen.
Sit up straight.

55:55.439 --> 55:57.232
Some of your guests
don't understand...

55:57.357 --> 55:59.902
that you're thinking about physics
and having a wonderful time.

56:00.027 --> 56:03.530
It looks like you're in pain.
Sit up and go talk to your guests."

56:05.782 --> 56:07.784
In 1979...

56:07.951 --> 56:12.039
I was elected
Lucasian Professor of Mathematics.

56:13.916 --> 56:18.712
This is the same chair
once held by Isaac Newton.

56:20.422 --> 56:24.718
They have a big book
which every university teaching officer...

56:24.843 --> 56:26.929
is supposed to sign.

56:28.430 --> 56:32.059
After I had been Lucasian Professor
for about a year...

56:32.184 --> 56:34.770
they realized I had never signed.

56:36.855 --> 56:39.483
So they brought the book
to my office...

56:39.608 --> 56:42.444
and I signed
with some difficulty.

56:44.196 --> 56:47.825
That was the last time
I signed my name.

56:59.294 --> 57:02.881
My interest in the origin
and fate of the universe...

57:03.006 --> 57:05.217
was reawakened
when I attended...

57:05.342 --> 57:08.804
a conference on cosmology
in the Vatican.

57:10.931 --> 57:13.183
Afterwards,
we were granted...

57:13.308 --> 57:16.228
an audience with the pope.

57:16.353 --> 57:18.939
He told us
that it was all right...

57:19.064 --> 57:21.650
to study the evolution
of the universe...

57:21.775 --> 57:24.319
after the Big Bang...

57:24.444 --> 57:28.031
but we should not inquire
into the Big Bang itself...

57:28.198 --> 57:31.118
because that was
the moment of creation...

57:31.243 --> 57:33.996
and therefore
the work of God.

57:36.331 --> 57:39.209
I was glad
that he did not know...

57:39.376 --> 57:42.796
the subject of the talk
I had just given...

57:44.590 --> 57:48.635
the possibility that the universe
had no beginning...

57:48.760 --> 57:51.054
no moment of creation.

57:56.560 --> 58:00.355
There were theories in the early '70s...
the first type of creation theories...

58:00.481 --> 58:04.318
where the people concerned started off
with a fixed, external space and time...

58:04.443 --> 58:06.570
which for eternity was empty...

58:06.737 --> 58:09.740
and then suddenly, for some
unknown reason, the universe nucleates...

58:09.865 --> 58:12.743
at a particular point
and then, bang, it blows apart.

58:12.868 --> 58:16.538
But the trouble is that when space
and time appear in the classical theory...

58:16.663 --> 58:20.083
that actual point itself
is a singular point in the mathematics.

58:20.209 --> 58:22.169
Mathematics breaks down,
and so...

58:22.294 --> 58:25.088
you cannot use that
to give you a creation theory.

58:27.007 --> 58:29.092
If one goes back in time...

58:29.218 --> 58:32.596
one comes
to the Big Bang singularity...

58:32.721 --> 58:35.599
where the laws
of physics break down.

58:37.392 --> 58:40.145
But there's
another direction of time...

58:40.270 --> 58:44.650
that one can go in
which avoids the singularity.

58:46.485 --> 58:50.781
This is called
the imaginary direction of time.

58:52.324 --> 58:54.451
In imaginary time...

58:54.618 --> 58:57.538
there need not be
any singularities...

58:57.663 --> 59:01.500
which form a beginning
or end to time.

59:04.878 --> 59:08.006
When you come to imaginary time,
you have this rather peculiar possibility...

59:08.131 --> 59:10.300
of having a "now,"
as it were...

59:10.467 --> 59:12.636
without necessarily having
a sort of a chain...

59:12.761 --> 59:15.973
of past moments.

59:16.139 --> 59:19.935
If we start where we are at the moment
and start running backwards in time...

59:20.060 --> 59:22.521
then for a long time,
things work perfectly normally.

59:22.646 --> 59:25.524
But as you begin to get
further and further back towards...

59:25.649 --> 59:28.819
what would be the origin point
in the conventional real-time picture...

59:28.986 --> 59:31.905
you'd find that
the nature of time changes...

59:32.030 --> 59:35.617
that the imaginary component
becomes more and more prominent...

59:35.742 --> 59:39.121
until what ought to have been
the singular point in the classical theory...

59:39.246 --> 59:41.582
gets smoothed away,
and you have this beautiful picture...

59:41.707 --> 59:44.501
of these bowls where the creation
of the universe is pictures...

59:44.626 --> 59:47.504
of where we are now,
and a smooth bowl of the past...

59:47.629 --> 59:50.757
where there's no initial point,
just a sort of smooth shape.

59:59.266 --> 01:00:02.478
So long as the universe
had a beginning...

01:00:02.603 --> 01:00:05.689
we could suppose
it had a creator.

01:00:07.316 --> 01:00:11.153
But if the universe
is completely self-contained...

01:00:11.278 --> 01:00:13.822
having no boundary or edge...

01:00:15.199 --> 01:00:18.827
it would neither be
created nor destroyed.

01:00:18.952 --> 01:00:21.705
It would simply be.

01:00:24.374 --> 01:00:27.544
What place, then, for a creator?

01:00:31.882 --> 01:00:34.384
All you can really say
is that the universe is...

01:00:34.551 --> 01:00:36.512
because it's a self-consistent
mathematical structure.

01:00:36.637 --> 01:00:39.681
There's no past because,
unlike the creation-as-a-point scenario...

01:00:39.806 --> 01:00:41.850
there's nothing for it
to be created in.

01:00:41.975 --> 01:00:45.354
So to say it's created from nothing
is a bit of a misnomer.

01:00:45.479 --> 01:00:47.481
It's a misleading use
of the word "nothing".

01:00:47.606 --> 01:00:52.152
It's not just that there was empty space in which
the universe appeared, which you might call "nothing".

01:00:52.277 --> 01:00:55.572
There was really nothing at all,
because there wasn't even a creation event.

01:00:55.739 --> 01:00:59.493
The use of a past tense in a verb
becomes inappropriate in these theories.

01:00:59.618 --> 01:01:02.913
Unfortunately, tenses were set up when
people believed in real time, of course...

01:01:03.038 --> 01:01:06.917
and we don't yet have a linguistic form
to describe tenses in imaginary time.

01:01:07.334 --> 01:01:11.547
The word "time" was not
handed down from heaven...

01:01:11.672 --> 01:01:13.799
as a gift from on high.

01:01:13.924 --> 01:01:16.969
The idea of time
is a word...

01:01:17.094 --> 01:01:19.263
invented by man...

01:01:19.429 --> 01:01:22.057
and if it has puzzlements
connected with it...

01:01:22.182 --> 01:01:24.768
whose fault is it?
It's our fault.

01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:29.982
Where does the difference...

01:01:30.107 --> 01:01:32.776
between the past and the future
come from?

01:01:35.112 --> 01:01:38.073
The laws of science
do not distinguish...

01:01:38.198 --> 01:01:40.534
between the past
and the future.

01:01:41.994 --> 01:01:44.621
Yet there is a big difference...

01:01:44.788 --> 01:01:48.458
between the past and future
in ordinary life.

01:01:54.923 --> 01:01:58.385
You may see a cup of tea
fall off a table...

01:01:58.510 --> 01:02:01.638
and break into pieces
on the floor...

01:02:01.763 --> 01:02:05.517
but you will never see the cup
gather itself back together...

01:02:05.642 --> 01:02:08.020
and jump back on the table.

01:02:11.106 --> 01:02:14.109
The increase of disorder,
or entropy...

01:02:14.234 --> 01:02:17.779
is what distinguishes
the past from the future...

01:02:17.905 --> 01:02:20.407
giving a direction to time.

01:02:26.663 --> 01:02:28.999
He fell ill in Switzerland.

01:02:29.166 --> 01:02:32.294
When he came back,
he was on a ventilator.

01:02:32.419 --> 01:02:35.547
Because he's on a ventilator,
you've got a tube down your throat...

01:02:35.672 --> 01:02:38.008
and therefore you can't speak,
just for that reason.

01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:41.386
For that period, which may
have been a couple of months...

01:02:41.512 --> 01:02:46.183
I spent probably one in two nights,
one in three nights, at the hospital...

01:02:46.308 --> 01:02:49.728
because when he was
in hospital...

01:02:49.853 --> 01:02:52.022
he couldn't communicate
with the nurses.

01:02:52.189 --> 01:02:54.525
It's not just like
being seriously ill...

01:02:54.650 --> 01:02:58.278
but you're in a position where the nurses
couldn't understand what Stephen wanted.

01:02:58.403 --> 01:03:01.365
If Stephen was uncomfortable,
they couldn't tell why.

01:03:04.159 --> 01:03:06.411
Before I caught pneumonia...

01:03:06.537 --> 01:03:09.331
my speech had been getting
more slurred...

01:03:09.456 --> 01:03:13.001
so that only a few people
who knew me well...

01:03:13.126 --> 01:03:15.045
could understand me.

01:03:16.547 --> 01:03:19.049
But at least
I could communicate.

01:03:21.385 --> 01:03:23.387
I wrote scientific papers...

01:03:23.512 --> 01:03:25.889
by dictating to a secretary...

01:03:26.056 --> 01:03:28.892
and I gave seminars
through an interpreter.

01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:33.021
And then,
a tracheostomy operation...

01:03:33.147 --> 01:03:36.400
removed my ability
to speak altogether.

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:43.615
After a long time...
well, it seemed like a long time...

01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:46.410
somebody came up
with this brilliant gadget.

01:03:46.535 --> 01:03:49.246
They didn't have it
at the Cambridge hospital.

01:03:49.413 --> 01:03:51.415
They got it
from somewhere in London.

01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:55.294
This was high technology... how you can
communicate with a person with no voice.

01:03:55.419 --> 01:03:59.173
It's a plastic piece of Perspex
about so big...

01:03:59.298 --> 01:04:03.760
and you've got the letters of the alphabet
arranged like that, and a hole in the middle.

01:04:03.927 --> 01:04:06.430
You hold it up between you
and the other person.

01:04:06.555 --> 01:04:10.476
They look at a letter, and you can see
which letter they're looking at...

01:04:10.601 --> 01:04:13.228
most of the time.
Sometimes you can't be sure.

01:04:13.353 --> 01:04:16.607
So you would get the patient
to spell out what they wanted.

01:04:16.773 --> 01:04:19.610
So each letter...
they have to look to pick out the A.

01:04:19.776 --> 01:04:22.779
You say, "A?" Did you get it right?
It's like a guessing game.

01:04:45.010 --> 01:04:49.389
Stephen wasn't willing to accept
that he wasn't going to speak again...

01:04:49.515 --> 01:04:51.683
and he thought
he would be giving in...

01:04:51.809 --> 01:04:55.646
by trying to find a method
of communicating other than speech.

01:04:56.063 --> 01:04:59.817
I remember
I went in one evening...

01:04:59.983 --> 01:05:02.653
and this was the first time
that he asked...

01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:05.364
to be gotten out of bed
to use the computer.

01:05:05.489 --> 01:05:09.117
Sometimes they'd sit him up
so he wasn't lying in bed all the time...

01:05:09.243 --> 01:05:12.496
as you do with a patient,
but this time when I turned up...

01:05:12.663 --> 01:05:15.457
he asked the nurse,
could he be gotten out of bed...

01:05:16.792 --> 01:05:19.086
so he could use the computer,
and he did.

01:05:19.211 --> 01:05:22.422
I remember the first thing he typed
on there after saying hello...

01:05:22.548 --> 01:05:25.425
Stephen's always very polite
about things like that...

01:05:25.551 --> 01:05:29.346
was, "Will you help me
finish my book?"

01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:37.771
A computer expert in California...

01:05:37.896 --> 01:05:39.898
heard of my plight...

01:05:40.023 --> 01:05:42.359
and sent me
a computer program...

01:05:42.526 --> 01:05:44.319
called Equalizer.

01:05:46.405 --> 01:05:48.907
This allowed me to select words...

01:05:49.032 --> 01:05:52.035
from a series of menus
on a screen...

01:05:52.161 --> 01:05:54.997
by pressing
a switch in my hand.

01:05:59.042 --> 01:06:03.297
These words could then be sent
to a speech synthesizer...

01:06:03.422 --> 01:06:05.799
attached to my wheelchair.

01:06:08.093 --> 01:06:10.095
Much to my surprise...

01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:12.890
I found I was able
to communicate...

01:06:13.056 --> 01:06:15.058
much better than before.

01:06:18.562 --> 01:06:21.607
When eventually
he went home from hospital...

01:06:21.732 --> 01:06:24.651
he was told he needed 24-hour nursing,
and everyone was saying...

01:06:24.776 --> 01:06:27.362
"How is he going
to go in and do work?

01:06:27.488 --> 01:06:30.908
Is he going to trail around
with nurses after him in the office?"

01:06:31.074 --> 01:06:33.076
And of course he did.

01:06:33.202 --> 01:06:36.705
They talked originally of him
working at home...

01:06:36.830 --> 01:06:39.082
which he wasn't happy with.

01:06:40.792 --> 01:06:44.171
And so, after a period
of recuperation at home...

01:06:44.296 --> 01:06:46.757
he just decided
to go back into the office.

01:06:46.924 --> 01:06:50.135
And he'd make the trip
from his house to the office...

01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:53.055
which is, I don't know,
half a mile in his wheelchair...

01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:54.932
with a nurse walking
along with him.

01:06:55.098 --> 01:06:57.851
This is at the time
when he was still driving around...

01:06:57.976 --> 01:06:59.895
with the bag
and the nasal drip...

01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:03.941
going into the department,
working, going back home.

01:07:07.778 --> 01:07:10.280
I began to wonder what would happen...

01:07:10.447 --> 01:07:13.200
when the universe
stopped expanding...

01:07:13.325 --> 01:07:15.702
and began to contract.

01:07:17.204 --> 01:07:19.456
Would we see broken cups...

01:07:19.581 --> 01:07:22.251
gather themselves together
off the floor...

01:07:22.376 --> 01:07:25.003
and jump back onto the table?

01:07:27.297 --> 01:07:30.801
Would we be able
to remember tomorrow's prices...

01:07:30.968 --> 01:07:34.054
and make a fortune
off the stock market?

01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:38.267
It seemed to me...

01:07:38.392 --> 01:07:41.562
the universe had to return
to a smooth and ordered state...

01:07:41.687 --> 01:07:43.647
when it recollapsed.

01:07:46.483 --> 01:07:49.736
If this were so,
time would go backwards...

01:07:49.862 --> 01:07:52.656
when the universe
began to collapse.

01:07:54.992 --> 01:07:59.163
People in the contracting phase
would live their lives backward.

01:07:59.288 --> 01:08:01.832
They would die
before they were born...

01:08:01.957 --> 01:08:05.544
and get younger
as the universe got small again.

01:08:06.795 --> 01:08:10.174
Eventually, they would
return to the womb.

01:08:13.427 --> 01:08:15.929
He gave me
my first problem to do.

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:20.267
He asked me to look
at this mathematical problem.

01:08:20.392 --> 01:08:23.270
Usually when he gives a problem,
he has a good idea...

01:08:23.395 --> 01:08:25.439
of what the answer
should be.

01:08:25.564 --> 01:08:29.109
I went to look at it,
and it took me a few months...

01:08:29.234 --> 01:08:33.279
to understand what it was about, and I
came back and said, "I get this answer."

01:08:33.404 --> 01:08:36.867
And he said to me,
"No, that is not what I expected."

01:08:37.033 --> 01:08:41.078
I said, "That's what I get." So I went
to the blackboard, explained what it was.

01:08:41.205 --> 01:08:45.000
He said, "Did you think about that
particular case?" I said, "No, I didn't."

01:08:45.125 --> 01:08:47.169
So I went back...

01:08:47.294 --> 01:08:50.005
and I calculated
what he'd talked to me about.

01:08:50.130 --> 01:08:54.259
I came back a few weeks after,
and I said, "Stephen, I don't get this thing.

01:08:54.384 --> 01:08:57.513
I still get the same answer
I had originally."

01:08:57.638 --> 01:09:00.307
So he said to me,
"No, no, no, no.

01:09:00.432 --> 01:09:02.434
This doesn't work.
Did you think about that?"

01:09:02.559 --> 01:09:05.229
I said, "Oh, no. I'd forgotten
about that particular case."

01:09:05.354 --> 01:09:08.689
So I went back to the drawing board
and started calculating again...

01:09:08.816 --> 01:09:10.818
and again
I got the same answer.

01:09:10.943 --> 01:09:14.988
So I went back to see Stephen, and
this dragged on for two or three months.

01:09:16.573 --> 01:09:18.867
Finally he said to me...

01:09:18.992 --> 01:09:21.245
"Maybe one of your approximations
is not valid."

01:09:23.037 --> 01:09:26.582
So me and a colleague decided
to do the thing with computers.

01:09:26.707 --> 01:09:29.837
This takes a lot of time
to write the programs...

01:09:29.962 --> 01:09:31.712
and to be sure
the program was correct.

01:09:31.839 --> 01:09:35.425
We get the answer, and it was still
the way I'd said before...

01:09:35.551 --> 01:09:39.763
and not the way Stephen said, so we went
to see Stephen and said, "See? Again."

01:09:43.767 --> 01:09:45.810
I had made a mistake.

01:09:48.188 --> 01:09:52.109
I had been using
too simple a model of the universe.

01:09:54.444 --> 01:09:56.405
Time will not reverse direction...

01:09:56.530 --> 01:09:59.449
when the universe
begins to contract.

01:10:02.953 --> 01:10:05.831
People will continue
to get older...

01:10:05.956 --> 01:10:10.127
so it is no good waiting
until the universe recollapses...

01:10:10.252 --> 01:10:12.296
to return to our youth.

01:10:28.437 --> 01:10:31.231
Einstein once
asked the question...

01:10:31.356 --> 01:10:33.650
"How much choice
did God have...

01:10:33.817 --> 01:10:36.278
in constructing the universe?"

01:10:38.489 --> 01:10:43.243
If my proposal that the universe
has no boundary is correct...

01:10:43.368 --> 01:10:45.496
he had no freedom at all...

01:10:45.621 --> 01:10:48.207
to choose
how the universe began.

01:10:50.167 --> 01:10:52.586
He would only have had
the freedom...

01:10:52.711 --> 01:10:55.672
to choose the laws
the universe obeyed.

01:10:57.633 --> 01:10:59.885
This, however,
may not have been...

01:11:00.010 --> 01:11:02.262
all that much of a choice.

01:11:04.097 --> 01:11:07.643
There may well be
only one unified theory...

01:11:07.768 --> 01:11:10.479
that allows for the existence
of structures...

01:11:10.604 --> 01:11:13.357
as complicated
as human beings...

01:11:13.524 --> 01:11:17.110
who can investigate
the laws of the universe...

01:11:17.236 --> 01:11:19.822
and ask
about the nature of God.

01:11:27.955 --> 01:11:30.999
I don't know how clear-cut
these experiments are...

01:11:31.124 --> 01:11:35.295
but there are experiments that have been
done on the timing of consciousness...

01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:38.382
and they seem to lead
to a very odd picture...

01:11:38.549 --> 01:11:41.343
which doesn't even quite
make consistent sense.

01:11:41.468 --> 01:11:43.554
Whether refinement
of these experiments...

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:46.557
might get rid of this kind
of anomaly I'm not sure...

01:11:46.682 --> 01:11:50.561
but it does look a little as though there
is something very odd about consciousness...

01:11:50.727 --> 01:11:54.314
and somehow almost as though
the future affects the past in some way...

01:11:54.439 --> 01:11:57.943
over a very tiny, limited scale,
but something maybe of the order...

01:11:58.068 --> 01:12:00.028
of a reasonable
fraction of a second.

01:12:00.362 --> 01:12:02.406
And there's no reason
to believe...

01:12:02.531 --> 01:12:05.284
that one's
conscious experience...

01:12:05.409 --> 01:12:08.328
shouldn't be part
of somebody else's...

01:12:08.453 --> 01:12:10.247
at some other stage.

01:12:10.414 --> 01:12:13.709
I don't know if it's fair to say
what happens after one dies...

01:12:13.834 --> 01:12:16.003
but it's a plausible picture...

01:12:16.128 --> 01:12:17.921
that you could be
somebody else...

01:12:18.046 --> 01:12:22.050
and that somebody else could be somebody
that lived in the past, not in the future.

01:12:25.387 --> 01:12:29.516
Even if there is only
one possible unified theory...

01:12:29.641 --> 01:12:32.895
that is just a set
of rules and equations...

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:37.858
what is it that breathes fire
into the equations...

01:12:37.983 --> 01:12:41.487
and makes a universe
for them to describe?

01:12:43.447 --> 01:12:47.743
Why does the universe
go to all the bother of existing?

01:12:49.953 --> 01:12:52.623
Is the unified theory
so compelling...

01:12:52.748 --> 01:12:55.792
that it brings about
its own existence?

01:12:57.127 --> 01:12:59.379
Or does it need a creator?

01:13:00.672 --> 01:13:02.549
And, if so...

01:13:02.674 --> 01:13:04.635
who created him?

01:13:13.727 --> 01:13:17.022
I think I would say
that the universe has a purpose.

01:13:17.147 --> 01:13:20.317
It's not somehow
just there by chance.

01:13:20.442 --> 01:13:23.111
I think it's... Yeah.

01:13:23.237 --> 01:13:25.697
So...

01:13:25.823 --> 01:13:28.283
it's... it's...

01:13:28.408 --> 01:13:31.662
Some people, I think, take the view
that the universe is just there...

01:13:31.829 --> 01:13:35.290
and it sort of runs and runs,
and it just sort of computes...

01:13:35.415 --> 01:13:38.627
and we happen somehow by accident
to find ourselves in this thing.

01:13:38.752 --> 01:13:41.797
But I don't think
that's a very fruitful...

01:13:41.922 --> 01:13:45.342
or helpful way
of looking at the universe.

01:13:45.467 --> 01:13:48.345
I think that there is something
much deeper about it.

01:13:50.681 --> 01:13:54.560
In real time,
the time in which we live...

01:13:54.685 --> 01:13:58.647
the universe has
two possible destinies:

01:13:58.772 --> 01:14:02.442
It may continue
to expand forever...

01:14:04.236 --> 01:14:07.406
or it may recollapse
and come to an end...

01:14:07.531 --> 01:14:09.491
at the Big Crunch.

01:14:11.326 --> 01:14:14.246
It would be rather like
the Big Bang...

01:14:14.371 --> 01:14:16.373
but in reverse.

01:14:18.292 --> 01:14:22.212
I now believe that the universe
will come to an end...

01:14:22.379 --> 01:14:24.506
at the Big Crunch.

01:14:25.632 --> 01:14:28.719
I do, however,
have certain advantages...

01:14:28.844 --> 01:14:31.388
over many other
prophets of doom.

01:14:33.765 --> 01:14:37.227
Whatever happens
ten billion years from now...

01:14:37.352 --> 01:14:41.106
I don't expect to be around
to be proved wrong.

01:14:43.817 --> 01:14:48.280
Of all the pictures
that I know...

01:14:48.405 --> 01:14:51.241
the simplest
of any cosmology...

01:14:51.366 --> 01:14:54.578
is that in which
the universe is closed...

01:14:54.745 --> 01:14:56.872
has a finite lifetime...

01:14:56.997 --> 01:15:00.250
and collapses
with the same kind of collapse...

01:15:00.375 --> 01:15:02.252
that a black hole does.

01:15:04.546 --> 01:15:06.882
If it should turn out
that indeed...

01:15:07.007 --> 01:15:10.093
the universe
is limited in its life...

01:15:12.262 --> 01:15:15.432
how is that different
from the life...

01:15:15.599 --> 01:15:17.434
of each one of us?

01:15:27.277 --> 01:15:29.780
On the evening
of Tuesday, March 5th...

01:15:29.905 --> 01:15:32.366
at about 10:45...

01:15:32.491 --> 01:15:35.452
I was returning
to my flat in Pinehurst.

01:15:37.955 --> 01:15:39.873
It was dark and raining.

01:15:41.667 --> 01:15:43.794
I came
up to Grange Road...

01:15:43.961 --> 01:15:46.255
and saw
headlights approaching...

01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:49.132
but judged that they were
far enough away...

01:15:49.258 --> 01:15:51.343
that I could cross safely.

01:15:54.138 --> 01:15:57.683
The vehicle must have been
traveling very fast...

01:15:57.808 --> 01:16:01.395
for when I got just past
the middle of the road...

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:04.273
my nurse screamed,
"Look out!"

01:16:06.692 --> 01:16:08.986
I heard tires skidding...

01:16:09.111 --> 01:16:12.906
and my wheelchair was struck
a tremendous blow in the back.

01:16:14.992 --> 01:16:16.869
I ended up in the road...

01:16:16.994 --> 01:16:20.372
with my legs over the remains
of the wheelchair.

01:16:22.166 --> 01:16:25.127
The accident destroyed
my wheelchair...

01:16:25.252 --> 01:16:27.671
and damaged
my computer system...

01:16:27.796 --> 01:16:29.715
with which I communicate.

01:16:32.217 --> 01:16:35.846
I required 13 stitches
in my head...

01:16:37.514 --> 01:16:42.019
but I was able to go back to work
several days later.

01:16:47.274 --> 01:16:50.861
The memories I have
are very much...

01:16:51.028 --> 01:16:52.905
kind of...

01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:55.991
visual pictures
of what Stephen was...

01:16:56.116 --> 01:17:00.287
of seeing Stephen
in certain situations.

01:17:00.412 --> 01:17:03.415
He was always moving.

01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:05.209
Always.

01:17:05.334 --> 01:17:07.294
Well, hardly ever still.

01:17:08.378 --> 01:17:12.716
It was the same thing
about his face and gesture...

01:17:12.841 --> 01:17:15.135
which he used a great deal,
I should say...

01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:18.013
but it's only memory.

01:17:19.306 --> 01:17:22.017
I found some photographs
recently...

01:17:22.142 --> 01:17:25.729
which reminded me
of the general look of everybody...

01:17:25.854 --> 01:17:29.817
and I must say Stephen looked
very much like he does now...

01:17:31.068 --> 01:17:34.029
if one thinks of him like that.

01:17:40.536 --> 01:17:43.664
He does believe
very intensely...

01:17:43.789 --> 01:17:49.336
in the almost infinite
possibility of the human mind.

01:17:49.711 --> 01:17:51.964
You have to find out
what you can't know...

01:17:52.089 --> 01:17:54.091
before you know you can't,
don't you?

01:17:54.258 --> 01:17:58.595
So I don't think that thought
should be restricted at all.

01:17:58.762 --> 01:18:02.933
Why shouldn't you go on
thinking about the unthinkable?

01:18:03.058 --> 01:18:05.102
Somebody's
got to start sometime.

01:18:05.269 --> 01:18:08.689
Think how many things
were unthinkable a century ago...

01:18:08.814 --> 01:18:10.858
and yet people
have thought them.

01:18:10.983 --> 01:18:13.193
And often they also seemed
quite unpractical.

01:18:14.695 --> 01:18:17.364
Not all the things
Stephen says probably...

01:18:17.489 --> 01:18:19.658
are to be taken
as gospel truth.

01:18:19.783 --> 01:18:22.244
He's a searcher.
He's looking for things.

01:18:22.369 --> 01:18:26.123
And sometimes he probably
talks nonsense. Well, don't we all?

01:18:26.290 --> 01:18:28.500
But the point is...

01:18:29.626 --> 01:18:31.920
people must think.

01:18:32.045 --> 01:18:33.922
People must go on thinking.

01:18:34.047 --> 01:18:37.468
They must try to extend
the boundaries of knowledge...

01:18:37.593 --> 01:18:40.095
and they don't sometimes
even know where to start.

01:18:41.972 --> 01:18:45.100
You don't know where
the boundaries are, do you?

01:18:45.225 --> 01:18:48.479
You don't know what
your taking-off point is.

01:18:57.571 --> 01:19:01.325
If we do discover
a complete theory of the universe...

01:19:01.450 --> 01:19:03.660
it should in time
be understandable...

01:19:03.827 --> 01:19:06.580
in broad principle
by everyone...

01:19:06.705 --> 01:19:09.249
not just a few scientists.

01:19:14.004 --> 01:19:15.964
Then we shall all...

01:19:16.089 --> 01:19:20.511
philosophers, scientists,
and just ordinary people...

01:19:20.677 --> 01:19:24.848
be able to take part
in the discussion of why it is...

01:19:25.015 --> 01:19:28.519
that we
and the universe exist.

01:19:32.064 --> 01:19:34.858
If we find
the answer to that...

01:19:34.983 --> 01:19:37.236
it would be
the ultimate triumph...

01:19:37.361 --> 01:19:39.321
of human reason...

01:19:42.366 --> 01:19:45.035
for then we would know...

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:47.538
the mind of God.
