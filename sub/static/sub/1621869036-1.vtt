14:26.160 --> 14:28.160
We're still detecting the ripples.

14:28.240 --> 14:31.160
They're consistent
at one-point-seven-three-six gigahertz.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.360
We located the source.

14:34.240 --> 14:35.320
Where is it?

14:35.480 --> 14:39.920
30AU from earth.
It's beyond the edge of our system.

14:40.520 --> 14:42.480
It makes no sense.
There's nothing there.

14:43.240 --> 14:45.280
Could it be something to do
with the original attack?

14:45.960 --> 14:48.120
I don't see how.
The attack was over six months ago.

14:55.960 --> 14:57.640
Theo asked me
if we were going to get married.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.480
Seriously?

15:00.200 --> 15:02.960
He's very protective of you.

15:04.120 --> 15:08.000
Then you should be nice to me
or he'll beat you up.

15:12.440 --> 15:13.480
I've got to go.

15:14.320 --> 15:15.320
Seriously!

17:10.280 --> 17:11.480
Oh, my God, that's disgusting.

30:29.880 --> 30:31.080
Nathan, what's going on?

30:31.160 --> 30:32.680
We found him in the snow.

30:32.960 --> 30:34.040
Take him to Greta.

30:40.160 --> 30:41.160
Search his bag.

40:15.840 --> 40:16.840
He's conscious.

41:57.880 --> 41:59.320
We should give him the antibiotics.

41:59.400 --> 42:01.000
We need to understand
what he's talking about.

42:01.080 --> 42:02.800
And if we need them
to treat someone else?

42:02.880 --> 42:04.360
Maybe this is more important.

42:04.440 --> 42:06.600
More important than the lives
of the other people here?

42:07.800 --> 42:09.320
What if your sister is hurt?

42:10.120 --> 42:11.480
It's more important than her life?

42:14.320 --> 42:15.320
No.

42:16.920 --> 42:19.400
Then we don't give him the antibiotics.

43:15.800 --> 43:17.080
What's this?

43:18.200 --> 43:21.080
It belongs to the alien guy.
I think it's his journal.

43:22.200 --> 43:23.560
They keep journals?

43:26.560 --> 43:27.560
What is all that?

43:27.960 --> 43:29.240
They're quantum equations.

43:29.920 --> 43:31.320
This is the Planck constant.

43:31.400 --> 43:34.360
I think this represents
wave particle duality.

43:34.480 --> 43:36.480
The rest I don't understand.

43:37.640 --> 43:39.240
His handwriting's
even messier than yours.

43:41.960 --> 43:43.840
Who's Bill Ward?

43:45.440 --> 43:46.760
I don't know.

43:49.160 --> 43:51.000
He said he was looking for him.
