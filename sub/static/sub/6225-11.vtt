and a time of magic,

00:05.089 --> 00:10.178
the destiny of a great kingdom
rests on the shoulders of a young boy.

00:10.261 --> 00:13.139
His name, Merlin.

00:27.028 --> 00:28.196
Halt!

01:08.569 --> 01:10.029
Didn't they teach you that?

01:16.244 --> 01:19.455
Well? Aren't you going to beg
for your life?

01:19.538 --> 01:22.041
A Knight of Camelot does not beg.

01:27.630 --> 01:30.049
-Indulge me.
-I'd rather die.

01:30.466 --> 01:32.802
Who am I to deny a man
his last request.

01:33.094 --> 01:34.512
(GROANING)

01:41.352 --> 01:44.772

I'd never see you again.

| found the boy
wandering in the woods.

05:34.043 --> 05:36.462
Lost and alone.
Hunted by Uther's men...

05:36.545 --> 05:38.756
-Who are you?
-My name is Alvarr.

05:40.466 --> 05:43.344
| too have been
hunted by Uther since I was a child.

05:43.427 --> 05:46.847
-You have magic?
-Yes, my Lady.

05:48.682 --> 05:52.603
As did my parents.
And their parents before them.

05:53.312 --> 05:55.689
They were fortunate to live
in a time of peace.

05:55.856 --> 05:58.484
Before your King
declared war on sorcery.

05:59.818 --> 06:01.529
| too have known
Uther's cruelty.

06:07.117 --> 06:11.539
Magic is not a crime.

06:15.834 --> 06:17.419
It is a gift.

06:18.796 --> 06:20.714
| wish to walk
free and without fear.

06:23.259 --> 06:25.135
The boy said you
would understand.

06:26.095 --> 06:30.349
What are you doing in Camelot?
You take a great risk in coming here.

06:30.432 --> 06:31.850
We came to see you.

06:37.523 --> 06:39.525
-Are you sure about this?
-Definitely.

06:39.608 --> 06:42.194
- Saw them with my own eyes.
-What were you doing there?

06:42.278 --> 06:44.071
-I heard voices in my...
-In your...

06:44.154 --> 06:47.283
In my chambers.
And I thought I should investigate.

06:47.366 --> 06:50.119
-Frankly, Merlin, it's hard to believe.
-I...

06:50.202 --> 06:52.496
For once you've shown
some real initiative.

06:54.748 --> 06:57.334
| will not stand by
and watch innocent people destroyed.

06:59.336 --> 07:02.089
And I am not alone.
Many have already joined me.

07:02.172 --> 07:05.342
-Many more join every day.
-However, this is a war you can't win.

07:05.426 --> 07:06.927
Uther has an army
at his disposal.

07:07.011 --> 07:08.637
Doesn't matter
how many you are,

07:09.513 --> 07:11.348
if you wield a weapon
powerful enough.

07:12.933 --> 07:16.687
When I was a child my
parents told me of a crystal.

07:18.564 --> 07:22.151
It was taken from the sorcerers
in the last days of The Great Purge.

07:22.401 --> 07:24.612
Taken? By Uther?

07:24.862 --> 07:27.531
It is here in Camelot.

07:28.157 --> 07:31.327
-Locked within the vaults beneath us.
-The vaults are impregnable.

07:31.952 --> 07:36.040
-You could never get it out.
-No, I could not.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.043
But you could.

07:44.006 --> 07:46.383
-Me?
-You are the King's ward.

07:46.759 --> 07:48.844
No one would suspect you.

07:50.846 --> 07:53.349
Morgana,
you are our only hope.

07:55.559 --> 07:58.020
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

08:08.656 --> 08:10.115
What on Earth
do you think you're doing?

08:13.243 --> 08:15.954
| had reason to believe
that there was an intruder in here.

08:16.038 --> 08:17.706
Right now, Arthur,
the only intruder is you.

08:17.790 --> 08:19.249
Camelot has been infiltrated.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.669
-Didn't you not hear the warning bell?
-Of course I did!

08:22.211 --> 08:24.505
Was hoping
I'd be safe in my chambers.

08:25.464 --> 08:28.676
Well, if you'll just permit me
to search your room.

08:28.759 --> 08:30.302
You'll do no such thing!

08:30.386 --> 08:32.304
Do you really think that
if there was someone in my room

08:32.388 --> 08:33.722
| wouldn't know about it?

08:36.975 --> 08:39.144
Please accept my apologies.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.948
-I don't understand.
-Oh.

08:51.198 --> 08:54.284
I'm sorry, Merlin,
which bit didn't you understand?

08:54.368 --> 08:57.037
The making a fool out of me,
or making a fool out of yourself?

08:57.121 --> 09:01.333
There was someone in there.
| know there was.

09:01.417 --> 09:05.462
Word of advice, Merlin. In the
future, stick to what you do best,

09:05.921 --> 09:07.214
nothing!

09:29.737 --> 09:32.072
-We owe you our lives, my Lady.
-You're safe for now.

09:32.156 --> 09:34.116
But Uther'll not rest
until he's found and killed you both.

09:34.199 --> 09:37.953
-You will help us, then?
-Please, Morgana. We need you.

09:40.330 --> 09:42.666
Yes. I will. Of course I will.

09:49.548 --> 09:51.759
(BELL TOLLING)

09:55.804 --> 09:57.598
-Late night?
-You could say that.

09:57.681 --> 10:00.559
| hear there was a disturbance,
an intruder in the city.

10:00.684 --> 10:04.605
Yeah,
| heard talking in my head.

10:05.898 --> 10:07.483
They had magic?

10:07.816 --> 10:10.611
| recognized the voice.
It was Mordred.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.906
The Druid boy?
What's he doing here?

10:13.989 --> 10:16.283
He was guiding someone
to Morgana's chambers.

10:16.492 --> 10:17.868
Are you sure?

10:20.704 --> 10:22.623
She and the boy
had a kind of bond.

10:22.748 --> 10:25.417
Yeah, but this,
is about more than that.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.337
-What do you mean?
-What if they'd been caught?

10:29.129 --> 10:33.383
Whatever they were doing,
they were prepared to die for it.

10:52.528 --> 10:55.948
-Merlin, I was looking for Arthur.
-He's out training.

10:56.824 --> 10:59.201
-Of course.
-Yeah. He trains every day.

10:59.785 --> 11:01.703
Same time. Same place.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.123
| just wanted to apologize
for last night.

11:05.707 --> 11:07.626
Another time, perhaps.

12:16.778 --> 12:19.406
-Come on, Merlin! I'm starving.
-You know what they say,

12:19.489 --> 12:21.825
good food takes
time to prepare!

12:23.035 --> 12:27.122
And this taste sensation
took exactly how long?

12:27.247 --> 12:30.500
-Nearly five minutes.
-Really? Five minutes.

12:30.584 --> 12:34.212
You need that long, you see,
to let it thicken.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.215
Thicken.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.261
(BELLS TOLLING)

12:57.653 --> 12:59.613
The Crystal of Neahtid.

13:01.156 --> 13:03.992
The locks are not damaged.

13:04.910 --> 13:06.119
What does that tell you?

13:07.913 --> 13:10.123
It tells me that somebody
stole my keys.

13:14.211 --> 13:16.797
-Was it precious, this crystal?
-Of course it was precious!

13:16.880 --> 13:18.507
It wouldn't been
down here otherwise, would it?

13:18.590 --> 13:19.716
-Right.
-Whoever it was,

13:19.800 --> 13:22.469
knew exactly what they were looking for.

13:22.552 --> 13:25.555
-Apparently.
-Apparently?

13:26.556 --> 13:27.641
That's all you've got to say?

13:27.975 --> 13:28.976
Tell me, Merlin,

13:29.059 --> 13:30.644
whose job is it to ensure

13:30.727 --> 13:32.479
that my chambers
are locked at all times?

13:33.563 --> 13:37.234
Whose job is it to ensure that
something like this never happens?

13:41.238 --> 13:42.572
Sorry!

13:46.201 --> 13:47.661
You're sorry?

13:49.579 --> 13:51.581
That's not good enough.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.585
-Did they force their way in?
-No, Sire.

13:56.628 --> 13:58.255
Then how did they
gain access to the vault?

14:01.508 --> 14:03.635
-They stole the keys.
-How is that possible?

14:05.303 --> 14:06.847
Someone broke
into my chambers.

14:08.140 --> 14:10.017
This is a grievous loss, Arthur.

14:10.100 --> 14:12.769
The Crystal of Neahtid
was locked away for good reason.

14:13.020 --> 14:15.897
-Why is it so important?
-It is an instrument of magic.

14:16.773 --> 14:21.278
In the days of The Purge, a great many
sorcerers died trying to protect it.

14:21.862 --> 14:24.281
Whatever it is,
it's important to them.

14:26.033 --> 14:28.869
I'll search the town.
Find out what I can.

14:29.286 --> 14:32.998
Arthur, this crystal cannot
fall into enemy hands.

14:34.833 --> 14:36.293
Yes, Sire.

14:43.717 --> 14:46.553
Arthur, thank you.

14:46.636 --> 14:48.430
-For what exactly?
-For...

14:48.513 --> 14:51.558
Lying to my father
to save your worthless hide?

14:51.641 --> 14:54.478
-Yes.
-You ever put me in that position again,

14:54.561 --> 14:55.937
I'll clap you in irons myself.

14:56.730 --> 15:00.984
And, Merlin, you'd better hope
we find that crystal.

15:06.323 --> 15:08.575
GAIUS:
Morgana stole the crystal?

15:08.658 --> 15:11.328
I'm certain of it, I caught
her in Arthur's chambers.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.080
She must have taken his keys.

15:14.331 --> 15:16.583
-Can you prove any of this?
-Not exactly...

15:16.666 --> 15:20.045
-Merlin...
-She did it. I'd bet my life on it.

15:20.170 --> 15:22.714
Merlin, you are accusing
the King's ward without proof

15:22.839 --> 15:26.009
-that's exactly what you'd be doing.
-I know. You're right.

15:28.011 --> 15:32.349
It doesn't make sense.
Why would Morgana steal such a thing?

15:32.516 --> 15:34.643
Uther said it was
an instrument of magic.

15:35.227 --> 15:37.521
There are many legends
about the crystal.

15:38.522 --> 15:41.733
-Is it some kind of weapon?
-That I don't know.

15:41.983 --> 15:44.986
-You have heard of it?
-Indeed. Sorcerers of the past believed

15:45.070 --> 15:46.738
it held the secret of time itself.

15:46.863 --> 15:49.533
-What did they mean by that?
-I'm not sure.

15:49.825 --> 15:52.661
The crystal is
an artifact of the Old Religion.

15:54.204 --> 15:56.540
There is only one
that could tell you more.

16:01.419 --> 16:05.757
- I need your help.
-I'm sure you do, young warlock.

16:05.882 --> 16:08.385
But first, you must
honor your promise.

16:08.593 --> 16:10.929
| said I would set you free
and I will!

16:11.555 --> 16:16.017
-When?
-When I know that Camelot is safe.

16:16.268 --> 16:19.729
-Please trust me.
-Why should I?

16:21.064 --> 16:23.108
Because you
don't have a choice!

16:24.526 --> 16:28.029
What is it that
you wish to know?

16:29.614 --> 16:31.825
What is
the Crystal of Neahtid?

16:32.742 --> 16:37.998
To those who know how to use it,
the crystal holds great knowledge.

16:38.081 --> 16:41.084
-What kind of knowledge?
-The knowledge of what is,

16:41.418 --> 16:45.881
what has been,
and what is yet to come.

16:46.423 --> 16:48.216
Do you mean,
it can show you the future?

16:48.300 --> 16:50.719
Amongst other things, yes.

16:53.430 --> 16:56.099
-The crystal has been stolen.
-By whom?

16:58.310 --> 16:59.394
The Lady Morgana.

16:59.477 --> 17:01.438
(LAUGHS)

17:02.606 --> 17:06.943
That witch does not have
the power to wield the crystal.

17:08.653 --> 17:13.157
-Does the Druid boy?
-Mordred? It is possible.

17:13.407 --> 17:14.910
Why do you ask?

17:15.076 --> 17:17.162
| believe they are involved
in this together.

17:17.412 --> 17:20.207
Once before I warned you
of the Druid boy.

17:20.290 --> 17:24.461
It is his destiny
to bring about Arthur's doom.

17:25.753 --> 17:29.424
-It may be that time is upon you.
-What do you mean?

17:29.507 --> 17:33.553
The ancient prophecies
speak of an alliance

17:33.637 --> 17:36.348
of Mordred and Morgana,

17:36.765 --> 17:39.476
united in evil.

17:40.268 --> 17:43.313
But this union
must be stopped.

17:45.523 --> 17:47.317
Whatever the cost.

17:49.861 --> 17:52.489
-Thank you, Gwen. That will be all.
-Nearly done.

17:55.617 --> 17:58.245
-It's fine, Gwen. You can go.
-It won't take a moment...

17:58.328 --> 17:59.829
| said you can go!

18:03.959 --> 18:05.252
My Lady.

19:11.568 --> 19:12.902
(HORSE NEIGHING)

19:24.205 --> 19:25.498
Morgana!

19:48.104 --> 19:53.318
It is my hope that, with time,
Mordred will master the crystal.

19:54.110 --> 19:56.237
And when he does,
we will strike Uther down.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.948
Uther and all who serve him.

19:59.783 --> 20:03.036
-All who serve him?
-If we are to win this war,

20:03.119 --> 20:04.621
there can be no half measures.

20:06.956 --> 20:08.291
| see this troubles you.

20:09.751 --> 20:12.253
Yes. Yes, it does.

20:12.420 --> 20:17.300
My Lady, we fight
for our very survival. As do you.

20:19.135 --> 20:21.471
The boy,
he told me you have magic.

20:26.017 --> 20:29.562
-You need not be afraid.
-I know.

20:30.522 --> 20:35.485
I'm sorry I have become so
used to concealing the truth.

20:35.568 --> 20:40.281
Believe me,
| understand what that feels like.

20:41.116 --> 20:42.867
Every day
| must look Uther in the eye.

20:42.951 --> 20:46.621
Knowing that if
he were to discover who I really am

20:46.704 --> 20:48.248
he would have me killed.

20:55.713 --> 20:56.923
You have been very brave.

20:57.924 --> 21:01.719
| don't want to be brave,
| just want to be myself.

21:04.097 --> 21:05.849
| don't want to
be alone anymore.

21:07.892 --> 21:13.189
You are not alone.
You are here with us.

21:14.107 --> 21:16.067
You need never be alone again.

21:26.619 --> 21:27.996
| must be heading back.

21:30.123 --> 21:32.000
The castle will
be waking soon.

21:38.548 --> 21:43.219
Farewell then,
my Lady Morgana.

22:02.489 --> 22:05.408
-Where is Morgana?
-She could not stay.

22:06.034 --> 22:10.121
-Will we be seeing her again?
-Yes, Mordred, you can be sure of that.

22:13.625 --> 22:18.171
Nicely done.
You played her well.

22:18.379 --> 22:22.175
It was not hard.
She is very beautiful after all.

22:27.055 --> 22:29.933
-Alvarr has a fearsome reputation.
-You know of him?

22:30.016 --> 22:32.977
| know he is a sorcerer and he
and his band of renegades

22:33.061 --> 22:35.897
-have threatened to overthrow the King.
-He sounded determined.

22:35.980 --> 22:39.776
He is a fanatic. And his
supporters follow him unthinkingly.

22:40.235 --> 22:43.613
-Blinded by his charisma.
-Well, it worked on Morgana.

22:44.072 --> 22:46.741
-So it would seem.
-And the Druid boy.

22:47.700 --> 22:48.868
Alvarr's using him, too.

22:48.952 --> 22:51.246
He seems to think the boy can harness
the power of the crystal.

22:52.622 --> 22:54.332
We can't let this happen, Merlin.

22:54.415 --> 22:56.960
But if we can't go to Uther
what can we do?

22:58.711 --> 23:00.463
We can bend
the truth a little.

23:02.924 --> 23:04.259
You know the whereabouts
of the crystal?

23:04.342 --> 23:05.677
| believe so, Sire.

23:06.010 --> 23:08.721
| see.
How did you come by this information?

23:09.180 --> 23:11.516
In my capacity as physician,

23:11.599 --> 23:13.017
| have dealings
with many different people.

23:13.101 --> 23:16.563
They hear things, Sire,
and they see things.

23:17.230 --> 23:19.566
Last night I was confronted
by one such man.

23:19.649 --> 23:21.276
He told me
that the crystal had been stolen

23:21.359 --> 23:23.444
by a band of renegades,

23:23.611 --> 23:26.489
led by a man called Alvarr.

23:27.699 --> 23:29.659
Who exactly was
this informant?

23:29.993 --> 23:32.870
| think it would only be fair
to protect their identity, Sire.

23:32.954 --> 23:35.331
If news of their betrayal
were to reach the renegades,

23:35.456 --> 23:38.376
-it could indeed endanger their life.
-Very well.

23:38.960 --> 23:41.170
-Where is this Alvarr hiding?
-He was last seen

23:41.254 --> 23:44.090
in the Valley of Chemary, Sire.

23:44.173 --> 23:45.341
Summon the guards, Arthur.

23:45.425 --> 23:46.968
| want this matter
investigated without delay!

23:47.051 --> 23:49.095
-Yes, Father.
-UTHER: Thank you, Gaius.

23:49.721 --> 23:51.764
Once again I am in your debt.

23:55.101 --> 23:57.562
Arthur, you're not seriously thinking
of going on this mission, are you?

23:57.645 --> 24:00.940
No, I'm not thinking of going,
| am going on this mission.

24:01.024 --> 24:03.610
-But you're chasing nothing but a rumor.
-True.

24:03.693 --> 24:06.029
But for now it's the only lead
we have to go on.

24:07.780 --> 24:10.158
You'll be wasting your time,
| assure you.

24:13.036 --> 24:16.581
-Morgana, I never knew you cared.
-What are you talking about?

24:16.831 --> 24:18.583
| can look after myself,
you know.

24:18.666 --> 24:20.001
It's a combination of

24:20.084 --> 24:23.129
raw talent
and hard training that makes me...

24:23.212 --> 24:25.590
Yes, I know.
That makes you so utterly obnoxious.

25:00.875 --> 25:03.586
Gaius had better
be right about this.

25:11.135 --> 25:12.220
(GASPS)

25:12.303 --> 25:15.056
-Morgana? What brings you here?
-Alvarr.

25:15.431 --> 25:17.642
Arthur's been sent
to capture the crystal.

25:18.184 --> 25:20.228
The Knights of Camelot
are almost upon us.

25:22.188 --> 25:24.190
-How has this happened?
- I don't know.

25:24.273 --> 25:26.150
| only know that
we've been betrayed.

25:26.901 --> 25:29.404
-How much time do we have?
-An hour. Maybe two.

25:29.487 --> 25:33.199
-I cannot say for sure.
-Then we must be prepared for them.

25:33.282 --> 25:34.325
What can I do to help?

25:34.409 --> 25:36.786
You can flee
while you still have the chance.

25:36.869 --> 25:39.706
Morgana, I am grateful
for all that you have done.

25:39.789 --> 25:42.041
But a battlefield
is no place for you.

25:55.054 --> 25:57.014
| don't know why I bring
you on these expeditions.

25:57.098 --> 26:00.143
-You spend the whole time terrified.
-I'm not terrified.

26:00.226 --> 26:02.770
-Yes, you are. I can tell you are.
-No, you can't.

26:02.854 --> 26:05.314
If you weren't scared,
you'd be talking rubbish as usual.

26:05.648 --> 26:10.653
Well, I am talking rubbish as usual.
| mean, I am talking as usual.

26:10.737 --> 26:12.488
So, clearly, I'm not scared.

26:25.626 --> 26:27.587
-Where now?
-No idea.

26:28.171 --> 26:30.006
| thought you said Gaius
gave you directions.

26:30.089 --> 26:34.719
He did, he...
He just didn't tell me about this part.

26:39.223 --> 26:42.560
Merlin, this is your fault.

26:43.978 --> 26:46.063
If you'd just guarded the keys
to the vault...

-They're coming. Hurry!

-It's that way.
-And you know this because?

| know it because of...

| give up.

27:17.220 --> 27:18.554
Because of this!
