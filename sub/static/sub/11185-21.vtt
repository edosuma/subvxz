WEBVTT

00:01.034 --> 00:02.411
You know guys, we're gonna do it.

00:02.469 --> 00:04.846
We're really gonna all make it to the top.

00:04.905 --> 00:06.578
Next, on Airwolf.

00:07.307 --> 00:10.151
They're scaling the back
side of San Jacinto Peak.

00:13.847 --> 00:16.053
You can leave, or you can die.

00:19.219 --> 00:21.495
Pack it up! We gotta get moving!

00:21.889 --> 00:24.460
It looks like they might
have run into the Cat Man.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073

02:31.418 --> 02:32.726
Good shot.

02:35.188 --> 02:36.929
How's it going?

02:38.425 --> 02:40.029
You killed a felis.

02:43.030 --> 02:44.100
What?

02:44.798 --> 02:48.041
Felis Canadensis… bobcat.

02:49.036 --> 02:50.174
You shot him.

02:51.071 --> 02:52.516
What the hell you do’n?

02:52.572 --> 02:54.279
You can't do that to a man's gun!

02:54.341 --> 02:57.686
You can leave, or you can die.

03:02.115 --> 03:03.526
What?

03:04.051 --> 03:05.325
It's your choice.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.866
Don't let me make the decision.

03:07.921 --> 03:09.992
Tom, maybe we should just clear out, huh?

03:10.057 --> 03:11.764
You know, this is public land.

03:11.925 --> 03:13.666
We got a right to be here.

03:14.594 --> 03:16.767
You got no right to kill my cats.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.742
Hey… um…

03:20.267 --> 03:22.076
how about we just leave, huh?

03:22.369 --> 03:23.712
Fine.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.122
We'll leave,

03:32.179 --> 03:34.557
but that doesn't mean we're gonna stay gone.

03:35.515 --> 03:36.858
I'll be watching you.

03:37.684 --> 03:39.322
You've been warned!

03:40.587 --> 03:42.123
Go, go!

03:44.224 --> 03:45.430
Come on, String!

03:55.402 --> 03:56.904
String, come on!

04:07.047 --> 04:08.958
You got him! You got him!

04:20.459 --> 04:21.995
Come on!

04:34.975 --> 04:36.352
Thank you.

04:37.077 --> 04:39.353
I don't even wanna begin to
tell you what you cost me.

04:39.412 --> 04:40.652
I don't even wanna hear about it.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.159
I love it! I love it!

04:42.549 --> 04:44.051
You had him all the way, Kirk.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.596
Caitlin, you're a traitor.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.497
Hey, a bet's a bet, you
gotta go with the odds.

04:54.628 --> 04:55.971
He almost had you, sweetheart.

04:56.029 --> 04:57.940
Now don't tell me you were betting on Hawke!

04:58.064 --> 05:01.477
Are you kidding me? I know
which side my bread's buttered on.

05:01.535 --> 05:02.605
You're a smart lady.

05:02.669 --> 05:04.342
I'm a lucky lady.

05:05.105 --> 05:06.584
You're a lucky guy.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.587
Hey, no way pal, I beat you fair and square.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.282
Next time I go up against
you with one of those things,

05:12.345 --> 05:14.552
I'm gonna hijack that wheelchair of yours,

05:14.614 --> 05:16.252
go do an extra long workout.

05:17.884 --> 05:20.694
Now tell me, is this a snivel?

05:21.688 --> 05:23.031
Not.

05:30.030 --> 05:32.943
Just don't tell me you're gonna
backstroke out of our agreement.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.273
Agreement? What agreement?

05:34.334 --> 05:37.338
Hey friend, you promised
you'd be here tomorrow,

05:37.404 --> 05:39.907
and we're counting on you as our safety man.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.247
Snivel, snivel.

05:41.308 --> 05:44.187
Snivel not. I said I'd
be here, I'll be here.

05:44.611 --> 05:46.557
Not to worry, we'll be there.

05:46.613 --> 05:49.685
I already got a chopper that's gonna
bring you guys down off the mountain.

05:50.283 --> 05:52.820
Now, what exactly is this POINT outfit?

05:52.886 --> 05:55.867
Oh, it's Paraplegics On
Independent Nature Trips.

05:56.189 --> 05:59.636
This time, they're scaling the
back side of San Jacinto Peak.

06:01.127 --> 06:02.572
Boy, sounds torturous.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.568
Who wants a street curb

06:06.766 --> 06:08.575
when you can climb the mountain?

06:18.578 --> 06:20.057
Don't worry.

06:22.115 --> 06:23.389
Everything's gonna be all right.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.656
I'll keep you all from harm.

06:26.820 --> 06:27.992
I'll protect you.

06:28.455 --> 06:29.729
Your family.

06:30.690 --> 06:32.033
I have to.

06:32.592 --> 06:34.162
Loved ones.

06:49.676 --> 06:52.748
Okay, your signature goes here,
and your initials here and here.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.150
What's with all this legalese?

06:55.215 --> 06:56.592
Oh, it's just standard waivers.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.721
That's just in case this climb kills you,

06:58.785 --> 07:01.766
see, the rest of us guys can
divvy up your earthly goods.

07:01.821 --> 07:04.131
You're gonna have to fight
that one out with my wife.

07:04.190 --> 07:06.136
She's got dibs on everything.

07:06.192 --> 07:08.934
I'm still trying to figure out
what you're trying to prove.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.175
Maybe nothing.

07:13.333 --> 07:15.040
Maybe everything.

07:21.241 --> 07:22.811
Now, this is only an over-nighter.

07:22.876 --> 07:24.685
You think you've got
enough gear there, Hawke?

07:25.912 --> 07:29.223
You tell me Captain, you're supposed
to be leader of this expedition.

07:35.522 --> 07:37.365
A little more diverse than I expected.

07:37.424 --> 07:39.267
Hey, hey, hey, look at that guy.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.137
He'll have no trouble get’n
up to the top of that mountain!

07:42.195 --> 07:43.833
Yeah, Rudy's a survivor, all right.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.433
He was a professional car thief.

07:45.498 --> 07:47.910
High-speed Police pursuit
put him in that chair.

07:48.835 --> 07:50.473
Blond guy's awful familiar.

07:50.603 --> 07:52.583
Yeah, probably from the Olympics.

07:52.639 --> 07:53.845
Ben Foran's his name.

07:54.441 --> 07:55.943
Pole vaulter.

07:57.911 --> 08:00.687
Right, I remember reading
about his accident.

08:00.747 --> 08:03.728
Say, isn't that Maurice,
your old golfing partner?

08:04.884 --> 08:08.661
Man, he could hit a ball
farther than I like to walk.

08:09.689 --> 08:13.432
You should’ve seen his swing before
a land mine blew his legs off in Nam.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.370
Guy was really a pro.

08:15.695 --> 08:16.901
Kirk, who's the cop?

08:16.963 --> 08:20.501
That's Charlie Callahan. Retired after
a shootout with some bank bandits.

08:21.067 --> 08:23.638
Says the gun's for snakes,
but you know ex-cops.

08:23.703 --> 08:25.774
Once a cop, always a cop.

08:26.239 --> 08:28.241
We'll be go’n up that hill, right up there.

08:29.109 --> 08:30.782
Cuts back in on a pack trail,

08:30.844 --> 08:33.552
and there are a lot of little switchbacks.

08:33.613 --> 08:35.785
And it gets real hairy.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.595
I'll stick real close to you.

08:40.086 --> 08:41.621
Yeah, big bad ex-con.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.169
Hey man, this ain't no
exercise yard at the county jail.

08:45.225 --> 08:46.863
This is “Smokey the Bear” country.

08:46.926 --> 08:48.132
You oughta know about that.

08:52.565 --> 08:53.669
Hey, what's happen’n?

08:53.733 --> 08:55.144
All right.

08:55.201 --> 08:56.475
Good to see you guys.

08:58.972 --> 09:01.475
Hey, in case you haven't met him yet,

09:02.142 --> 09:03.485
Stringfellow Hawke,

09:03.743 --> 09:05.552
- he's our safety man,
- Hi, Hawke.

09:05.612 --> 09:07.455
We'll try not to run over you, man.

09:09.015 --> 09:10.392
and Caitlin O'Shaughnessy.

09:10.450 --> 09:11.793
Hope she's our safety lady.

09:14.421 --> 09:17.459
Actually, Cate and the
duffer in the red satin cap,

09:18.324 --> 09:19.735
Dominic Santini,

09:20.460 --> 09:22.064
they are our pilots.

09:22.128 --> 09:24.165
I hope he's a better pilot
than he is a golfer, man.

09:26.533 --> 09:29.571
Now, Dom and Cate will pick us up
tomorrow in the chopper and bring us

09:29.636 --> 09:32.242
back <i>down</i> from the top of the mountain.

09:32.305 --> 09:33.875
- You got it.
- Yeah, that's the plan.

09:33.940 --> 09:37.046
Let's get up there and start look’n
down on everybody else for a change.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.090
You called it man. Let's go for it!

09:39.145 --> 09:40.988
Hey, let's get it together.

09:41.047 --> 09:43.186
Come on, guys. Come on.

09:43.483 --> 09:45.190
All right. How we gonna do it?

09:45.618 --> 09:46.892
The hard way!

09:47.053 --> 09:48.327
Which way?

09:48.621 --> 09:50.259
The only way! The only way! To the top!

09:50.323 --> 09:52.132
- All the way to the top!
- All the way!

09:52.192 --> 09:53.227
That's right!

09:53.293 --> 09:54.431
Do it! Do it!

09:54.494 --> 09:55.768
Right, let's hit it!

09:55.829 --> 09:57.001
You got it.

09:57.063 --> 09:58.337
All right.

10:00.533 --> 10:01.534
Keep up there.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.012
Take it easy, boys.

10:03.069 --> 10:04.605
See you at the top.

12:34.020 --> 12:35.124
What's this?

12:35.421 --> 12:36.491
A poacher?

12:36.556 --> 12:39.230
No, he wouldn't be hang’n a
kill out in the open like that.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.294
He's probably a bounty hunter.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.307
Farmers down in the valley.

13:05.251 --> 13:06.889
Hey, watch out for this one.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.023
No sweat.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.843
Man, that was some ride, huh?

13:23.036 --> 13:24.140
You all right?

13:24.203 --> 13:25.705
Well, pretty good.

13:29.042 --> 13:31.113
Hey man, you could've broke your neck!

13:32.478 --> 13:34.754
I could have broke my legs.

13:35.448 --> 13:37.359
Gimp, you ain't got no legs!

13:38.017 --> 13:39.792
I can at least dream, can't I?

13:41.921 --> 13:43.832
Hey, what do you say?

13:44.290 --> 13:45.701
Let's take a break and have a beer.

13:45.758 --> 13:47.260
Hey, my kind of safety man!

13:47.327 --> 13:48.670
Yeah, let's have a beer.

13:48.728 --> 13:49.866
All right.

13:49.929 --> 13:51.533
Okay. Come on, break ‘em out.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.268
What do you think, crew?

14:23.329 --> 14:24.501
It wasn't too bad for a first day, was it?

14:24.564 --> 14:25.702
No.

14:29.869 --> 14:30.939
You sore?

14:31.003 --> 14:32.175
I ache.

14:32.238 --> 14:34.343
Crew, why don't you stop clowning
and come help me out back here?

14:34.407 --> 14:36.353
I'm busy, I'm building up the fire…

14:36.409 --> 14:37.786
You're always busy.

14:37.844 --> 14:40.848
Come on, Ellison, you always got
a problem. Use that rock, all right?

14:40.913 --> 14:42.256
Okay, Kirk.

14:42.749 --> 14:45.161
I guess we'll have to
go on up the next hill.

14:57.296 --> 14:58.536
God almighty!

14:59.232 --> 15:00.370
Tom!

15:01.567 --> 15:04.275
That's the first cat I seen since sunup.

15:06.572 --> 15:08.552
You know, I say it's time we clear out.

15:09.942 --> 15:13.685
You know, you've been spooked ever
since we ran into that cat tracker.

15:13.946 --> 15:15.152
Has he been around lately?

15:15.214 --> 15:16.352
No.

15:18.351 --> 15:19.728
But I can feel him.

15:21.988 --> 15:26.334
Besides, when a bunch of crips come
rolling through your hunting camp

15:27.727 --> 15:31.300
in wheelchairs, then these damn
mountains are too crowded for me.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.535
Wheelchairs.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.202
I swear to God!

15:34.267 --> 15:36.474
They came rolling right through here.

15:36.536 --> 15:39.107
Like a troop of disabled boy scouts

15:39.272 --> 15:42.116
on their way to a handicapped
jamboree or something.

15:42.175 --> 15:44.485
You're getting awfully shaky.

15:45.111 --> 15:48.092
Listen, that tracker may have
kitty litter for brains,

15:48.147 --> 15:51.356
but he's not crazy enough to try
to chase us off the mountain.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.761
Unless he want us to end
up like one of his cats.

you didn't play it that way, but
it sounds like a blues song.

17:24.443 --> 17:25.580
Maybe it should have been.

17:25.645 --> 17:26.817
Gimme a blues song, Hawke.

17:27.980 --> 17:29.653
- Play it that way.
- Here.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.463
I'll tell ya.

17:37.356 --> 17:39.734
If I lost my legs,

17:40.059 --> 17:42.539
it'd make me real angry, you know.

17:42.695 --> 17:44.868
Just mad as hell for a while.

17:46.232 --> 17:47.336
We all were.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.708

18:16.228 --> 18:19.835
What do you say, Charlie? Let's
do it again the right way.

19:29.935 --> 19:31.243
Ah, Johno?

19:31.871 --> 19:33.179
you know,

19:33.673 --> 19:35.380
we do have a schedule to make.

19:36.042 --> 19:38.955
I don't think I'm gonna be able to keep it.

19:40.212 --> 19:42.624
Man, you made it this far, you can go on.

19:42.915 --> 19:45.088
Man, my blisters have blisters.

19:48.154 --> 19:49.258
All right.

19:49.321 --> 19:52.734
I think I'm gonna wait here till
the chopper comes picks me up here.

19:55.327 --> 19:57.432
You can do that if you want.

19:58.364 --> 20:00.275
But you'd probably regret it.

20:03.469 --> 20:05.676
What difference does it make?

20:08.307 --> 20:10.617
Only you can answer that part.

20:28.427 --> 20:29.667
Good morning.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.265
Yeah, isn't it?

20:31.330 --> 20:33.776
Expression of speech,
I'm not really sure yet.

20:33.833 --> 20:36.245
Hey, maybe some hot coffee would help.

20:36.368 --> 20:38.348
Oh, probably save a life.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.979
How about some breakfast?
You know, we have plenty.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.520
Oh, that'd be asking too much.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.419
No, I don't think so.

20:45.478 --> 20:48.823
Besides, it doesn't look like you came
prepared with any creature comforts.

20:48.881 --> 20:51.657
Well, my idea of roughing
it is a condo in Aspen.

20:53.319 --> 20:55.731
If you don't like the
outdoors, why'd you come?

20:57.089 --> 20:58.898
Oh, I like the out of doors, all right.

20:58.958 --> 21:02.303
I saw Robert Redford in
Jeremiah Johnson 3 times.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.632
Actually,

21:05.698 --> 21:08.838
my husband talked me into
letting him make the trip.

21:12.171 --> 21:14.378
I think he may have pushed
himself too far this time.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.215
Oh, no, don't worry about him.

21:16.542 --> 21:19.648
Really. If anything was wrong,
they would have radioed in by now.

21:23.149 --> 21:26.528
Just hope it's not just one more thing
that's gonna help tear us apart.

21:29.321 --> 21:30.732
Base Camp.

21:31.490 --> 21:33.128
Do you copy? It's Hawke.

21:33.192 --> 21:34.933
Dom, can you get that?

21:36.362 --> 21:38.103
Dom, are you up?

21:38.164 --> 21:39.438
What?

21:39.598 --> 21:41.168
Can you get the radio?

21:41.233 --> 21:43.304
You get it!

21:43.602 --> 21:45.980
I've got my hands full
with your breakfast.

21:54.413 --> 21:55.653
You're gonna catch a cold.

21:56.248 --> 21:58.854
Dom, Cate, are you there?

22:08.093 --> 22:09.868
Base camp. Go ahead.

22:09.995 --> 22:12.271
Now, Dom, I didn't wake you, did I?

22:14.200 --> 22:15.975
"Did I wake you, Dom?"

22:16.035 --> 22:19.448
No. No, no. You didn't wake me.

22:20.272 --> 22:21.842
What do you want?

22:23.742 --> 22:25.813
I just wanted to hear your voice, Dom,

22:25.878 --> 22:27.858
tell you everything was all right.

22:28.581 --> 22:30.583
I'll be check’n in with
you in a couple hours.

22:30.649 --> 22:32.720
We're right on schedule.

22:33.018 --> 22:34.497
See you at the top.

22:34.553 --> 22:35.623
Out.

23:41.954 --> 23:44.127
Hawke, can you do us a favor?

23:45.124 --> 23:48.003
I’m not gonna carry you up that
hill, if that's what you mean.

23:49.461 --> 23:51.168
Look, do you mind go’n on ahead?

23:52.298 --> 23:54.904
If we gimps are gonna make it up this one,

23:55.067 --> 23:56.671
it’s important that we do it on our own.

23:56.735 --> 23:58.009
You know what I mean?

24:02.374 --> 24:04.149
Yeah, I sure do.

24:04.944 --> 24:06.116
See you all at the top.

24:06.178 --> 24:07.418
Thanks, buddy.

24:10.049 --> 24:11.494
Come on, we can do it.

24:13.052 --> 24:14.827
- Let's go!
- To the top!

27:04.957 --> 27:06.459
Yeah, gimme some of that!

27:06.692 --> 27:08.103
All right!

27:10.863 --> 27:13.207
Man, you are one go-get’n gimp.

27:14.700 --> 27:15.872
Thanks, man.

27:17.236 --> 27:18.442
- Good climb.
- Thanks.

27:19.371 --> 27:22.181
4 more of those, and we'll be home free.

27:22.341 --> 27:23.649
No! No!

27:24.877 --> 27:25.878
No!

27:33.051 --> 27:34.860
You know guys, we're gonna do it.

27:34.920 --> 27:37.093
We're really gonna all make it to the top.

27:37.723 --> 27:39.168
Did you have your doubts, man?

27:41.126 --> 27:42.264
Yeah, I did.

27:42.728 --> 27:45.038
I guess you don't think
of me like that, huh?

27:45.097 --> 27:47.168
Having my doubts and all.

27:48.167 --> 27:49.840
Let me tell you someth’n.

27:50.102 --> 27:53.572
I was so scared I wasn't
gonna make it on that last climb,

27:54.039 --> 27:55.814
I couldn't even spit.

27:55.874 --> 27:57.979
Who had spit?

28:04.183 --> 28:08.063
For what it's worth, I just
thought ya’ll might wanna know that.

28:08.720 --> 28:11.667
Well Sarge, coming from
you, that means a lot.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.337
Get down, damn it! Take
cover! Get outta sight!

28:18.397 --> 28:19.774
Get down, guys! Down!

28:19.831 --> 28:21.105
Down, now!

28:21.833 --> 28:22.971
There he is!

28:25.737 --> 28:26.943
Get down!

28:27.005 --> 28:28.951
Get down and stay down!

28:32.344 --> 28:34.221
Who the hell's up there, anyway?

28:34.279 --> 28:35.417
Why'd they get Charlie?

28:35.480 --> 28:37.824
Maybe they just saw his
baseball cap and figured…

28:37.883 --> 28:39.988
- Figured what?
- figured he was a cop!

28:40.052 --> 28:42.794
He couldn't walk! None of us can walk!

28:43.088 --> 28:45.090
Charlie wasn't a threat to anybody!

28:46.091 --> 28:47.434
Well, come on!

28:47.526 --> 28:49.130
Pack it up! We gotta get move’n!

28:49.194 --> 28:51.367
Moving? What the hell are you talk’n about?

28:51.430 --> 28:53.637
I'm talk’n about we gotta get
off this ridge. Let's move it!

28:53.699 --> 28:57.078
Man, we're not like you! We
can't just get up and run away!

29:00.839 --> 29:02.512
Damn, the radio's broken.

29:02.574 --> 29:03.951
Now what?

29:04.243 --> 29:07.281
We gotta get off of here and under
the trees and get some cover.

29:07.346 --> 29:10.418
Yeah, by then, if we're not at the top, Dom
and Cate will come in with the chopper.

29:10.482 --> 29:12.985
That's easy for you to do
alone, but help’n us?

29:13.385 --> 29:15.729
This guy could follow!
He could kill us easy!

29:15.787 --> 29:17.095
Yeah, John's right!

29:17.356 --> 29:19.802
We gotta stay put, right
here and wait for help.

29:19.858 --> 29:23.431
Man, I'll be damned if I'm gonna
sit here, and play bull's eye!

29:23.595 --> 29:25.233
Yeah, like Charlie.

29:27.633 --> 29:30.477
Look, we made it up,
we can make it back down.

29:31.637 --> 29:33.241
Yeah, that's right. We can do it.

29:33.305 --> 29:34.477
We gotta do it.

30:15.614 --> 30:16.718
Come on, guys.

30:16.782 --> 30:18.659
It looked pretty smooth.
It looked pretty smooth.

30:18.717 --> 30:20.993
Slow it down, you guys!
We're losing control, here!

30:21.086 --> 30:22.724
Brake! Brake!

30:37.302 --> 30:38.872
All right, come on, we gotta keep move’n.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.015
Get down, get down!

31:05.564 --> 31:06.975
I see him!

31:07.232 --> 31:09.610
- Think he's dead?
- I don't care, Hawke is my friend.

31:09.668 --> 31:11.614
And I can't let him lie
down there, not knowing,

31:11.670 --> 31:13.581
not knowing one way or another.

31:13.638 --> 31:15.515
I gotta do someth’n!

31:16.208 --> 31:18.313
But I can't do this one alone.

31:18.844 --> 31:20.653
Okay. All right.

31:21.847 --> 31:23.451
We know what we gotta do.

31:23.515 --> 31:26.189
But you're not going down. You obviously
know how to use one of those,

31:26.251 --> 31:28.162
so you stay up here and cover us, okay?

31:31.022 --> 31:32.433
All right.

31:32.491 --> 31:33.595
Come on.

31:36.628 --> 31:39.541
Dom, he said they'd be on
schedule. That's what he said.

31:39.598 --> 31:42.010
Can't you try him on the radio again?

31:42.868 --> 31:44.643
Okay, worry-wart.

31:58.049 --> 32:00.222
String? Come in. This is Dom.

32:04.623 --> 32:07.126
String? This is Dom. Come in, will ya?

32:12.631 --> 32:13.939
String?

32:20.205 --> 32:22.116
Come on, get in. We'll go find ‘em.

32:22.274 --> 32:23.344
Great.

32:27.078 --> 32:29.217
Come on, come on… real slow.

32:32.117 --> 32:34.290
Easy, easy now.

32:35.654 --> 32:36.928
You all right, John?

32:38.156 --> 32:40.563
All right, let's move it, don't lose him.

32:41.493 --> 32:43.530
- Firm. Don't lose the hands.
- Okay.

32:43.628 --> 32:46.040
All right, we've got it.
Slow down just a little.

32:46.097 --> 32:47.269
Okay.

32:49.434 --> 32:50.742
Hawke?

32:53.738 --> 32:55.547
Easy does it.

32:57.342 --> 32:59.015
Man, what a fall.

33:06.184 --> 33:07.754
How you do’n?

33:07.819 --> 33:09.093
I broke my leg.

33:10.622 --> 33:11.726
Is he alive?

33:11.790 --> 33:13.599
Yeah, but he's hurt bad.

33:17.128 --> 33:19.130
We gotta get you outta here somehow.

33:20.632 --> 33:22.873
Where'd you come from?
How'd you get down?

33:22.934 --> 33:24.880
Well…

33:26.605 --> 33:29.245
I may have my limitations,

33:29.774 --> 33:32.118
but brains aren't one of them.

33:34.646 --> 33:35.852
Come on.

33:37.716 --> 33:39.718
- Let's go.
- All right! All right.

33:45.023 --> 33:48.596
We haven't heard from him since
this morning. He said he'd check in.

33:48.660 --> 33:52.699
Well, it could be they're in an area
that's cut’n off the radio signals.

33:53.465 --> 33:55.843
He'll call if he's in trouble. Don't worry.

34:06.077 --> 34:08.387
Don't let that line slip.

34:21.760 --> 34:23.205
Steady. Steady.

34:27.232 --> 34:29.007
Keep it going. He's come’n up fine.

34:29.100 --> 34:30.170
Keep coming.

34:30.302 --> 34:31.746
Keep coming.

34:31.902 --> 34:33.438
- Almost there.
- Okay.

34:33.605 --> 34:35.141
Okay. Okay.

34:35.306 --> 34:37.514
Steady! Steady!

34:48.253 --> 34:49.891
We've got him!

35:06.338 --> 35:07.646
There!

35:16.448 --> 35:17.688
Keep him coming.

35:17.749 --> 35:19.990
Okay. Okay.

35:27.892 --> 35:29.394
Good job, good job!

35:30.495 --> 35:31.940
All right.

35:32.530 --> 35:34.669
- Right on, over here.
- All right.

35:43.408 --> 35:44.478
All right Dom,

35:44.542 --> 35:46.681
we've backtracked the whole trail.

35:46.745 --> 35:48.918
Now, they have to have
taken a different way up.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.118
Or down.

35:52.217 --> 35:53.753
Maybe they <i>are</i> in trouble.

35:54.452 --> 35:57.160
What do you think? Should
we call in the Sheriff?

35:57.222 --> 35:58.758
Could be.

35:59.257 --> 36:01.362
And maybe we'd better break out the Lady.

36:01.793 --> 36:05.104
We can cover a whole lot
more territory that way.

36:15.540 --> 36:16.985
Hey, Dom!

36:19.177 --> 36:20.247
Dom!

36:24.816 --> 36:26.727
Hey! Up here!

36:26.785 --> 36:28.355
Here! Down here! Come on!

36:28.753 --> 36:30.892
Down here man, down here!

37:11.196 --> 37:13.836
Okay, he's up there and
we're down here, now what?

37:14.632 --> 37:16.737
I figure he's come’n back.

37:18.136 --> 37:20.810
There's not much we can do about it, either.

37:20.872 --> 37:24.649
Well, whatever we can do about it,
we're gonna have to do it now.

37:24.709 --> 37:25.710
Do what?

37:26.077 --> 37:28.114
Bait him. Draw him out.

37:28.413 --> 37:30.689
We've still got Charlie's gun.

37:34.686 --> 37:36.290
Got one good bullet left.

37:36.354 --> 37:37.662
What if you miss, man?

37:37.722 --> 37:39.360
Then we use whatever we got.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.862
Just like Nam.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.864
Just like Nam.

37:58.109 --> 37:59.349
Sheriff Tuttle?

37:59.544 --> 38:00.989
Caitlin O'Shaughnessy.

38:01.045 --> 38:02.115
Dominic Santini.

38:02.180 --> 38:05.024
My God! This isn't any of our group, is it?

38:05.083 --> 38:07.154
Couple of varmint hunters working the hills.

38:07.218 --> 38:10.222
- Oh, thank God. Well… I mean…
- That's okay.

38:10.522 --> 38:13.526
It looks like they might
have run into the Cat Man.

38:13.758 --> 38:14.862
The who?

38:15.727 --> 38:17.900
His name is Paul McClelland.

38:17.996 --> 38:21.341
And it also looks like he's
probably tracking your group.

38:21.599 --> 38:23.510
Tracking the… What for?

38:23.568 --> 38:25.980
Wait a minute Sheriff, there's
something about the way you said that.

38:26.037 --> 38:27.846
Could be, I'm hoping not.

38:28.006 --> 38:29.986
What's that supposed to mean, Sheriff?

38:30.041 --> 38:33.113
Well, this man McClelland,

38:33.211 --> 38:34.986
used to be some kind of Professor.

38:35.046 --> 38:36.719
A naturalist or something like that.

38:36.781 --> 38:40.092
Anyway, he came up here about 8
years ago to study the wildcats.

38:40.318 --> 38:41.820
Ended up writing a book.

38:41.886 --> 38:43.422
“Cry of the Cougar.”

38:43.788 --> 38:45.165
Kind of interesting.

38:45.223 --> 38:47.635
About how he had to learn
how to live like a cat

38:47.692 --> 38:49.729
in order to track and study them.

38:49.961 --> 38:51.565
Yeah, well, that's all
well and good Sheriff,

38:51.629 --> 38:53.870
but what's that got to do
with our missing group?

38:53.932 --> 38:56.776
Well, we've also got people missing
up here in these mountains.

38:56.835 --> 38:58.246
People we think

38:58.369 --> 39:00.872
might have had run-ins with
McClelland over his cats.

39:01.339 --> 39:04.320
That's what looks like
happened to these hunters.

39:04.375 --> 39:06.878
Well, are you saying that
he might be after our guys?

39:08.980 --> 39:10.550
That's what I'm saying.

39:25.597 --> 39:28.203
Cate, what do we got on the scanners?

39:35.006 --> 39:37.612
I've got nothing but a
bunch of mountain goats.

40:26.324 --> 40:27.769
Let's roll!

41:36.627 --> 41:38.231
You, hold it!

42:03.488 --> 42:04.831
Dom!

42:06.624 --> 42:09.036
Get the man on the hill!

43:22.033 --> 43:24.513
You are not all right, Stringfellow Hawke!

43:24.769 --> 43:26.976
You know what, sometimes you
can be the most stubborn man!

43:27.038 --> 43:28.676
We gotta get you to the hospital.

43:28.739 --> 43:31.015
I'm not go’n to any hospital.

43:31.209 --> 43:32.882
Hawke, your leg is maybe busted,

43:32.944 --> 43:35.151
and you got shot with an arrow.

43:37.215 --> 43:38.558
I'm okay.

43:38.916 --> 43:40.589
I was so afraid.

43:42.320 --> 43:44.357
I was so afraid of losing you!

43:50.761 --> 43:54.436
I don't think we're ever gonna have
to be afraid of anything else again.

43:57.902 --> 43:59.142
I love you.

44:12.283 --> 44:14.263
Think Charlie would mind?

44:15.253 --> 44:16.823
He'd be proud, Rudy.

44:17.822 --> 44:19.529
More than proud.

44:22.727 --> 44:24.206
Ben, you okay?

44:24.462 --> 44:26.032
Yeah, I'm okay. Yeah.

44:26.330 --> 44:27.809
You sure?

44:28.199 --> 44:31.373
Well, I do have a cut right here, you know.

44:34.539 --> 44:35.677
Over here, too.

44:37.742 --> 44:39.050
You do.

44:58.496 --> 45:01.943
Well, I guess you guys didn't make
it to the top of the mountain,

45:01.999 --> 45:05.003
but we sure are glad to have you back.

45:07.238 --> 45:08.717
We made it!

45:10.741 --> 45:12.379
Yeah, we all made it.
