01:31.593 --> 01:33.261
<i>Whenever I saw her...</i>

01:34.304 --> 01:35.680
<i>I knew...</i>

01:37.223 --> 01:39.642
<i>I was dreaming again.</i>

01:42.145 --> 01:44.606
<i>And once you know you're dreaming...</i>

01:45.982 --> 01:48.068
<i>it's an out-of-body experience.</i>

01:49.986 --> 01:52.197
<i>Sometimes you float upwards.</i>

01:54.532 --> 01:56.451
<i>In my dreams,</i>

01:57.452 --> 01:59.162
<i>I would always wonder...</i>

02:00.497 --> 02:03.124
<i>if my body were made of hydrogen.</i>

02:05.376 --> 02:06.920
<i>If so...</i>

02:08.545 --> 02:10.381
<i>then my memories...</i>

02:11.424 --> 02:13.593
<i>must be made of stone.</i>

03:25.915 --> 03:28.418
Do you know
you've been talking in your sleep?

03:33.089 --> 03:34.799
Did I wake you up?

03:39.888 --> 03:41.848
What did you dream about?

03:42.849 --> 03:45.727
Someone who disappeared.

03:50.815 --> 03:54.736
Whenever I'm about to forget her...

03:56.112 --> 03:57.697
I dream of her again.

03:59.199 --> 04:00.366
Your lover?

04:02.285 --> 04:03.661
I guess.

04:04.537 --> 04:08.917
But I never knew her real name or age...

04:10.126 --> 04:14.005
or anything about her past.

04:14.923 --> 04:19.928
That sounds like a story
from that book with the green cover.

04:23.640 --> 04:26.476
I told you not to go through my stuff.

04:35.068 --> 04:37.654
I wanted to know more about you.

06:39.108 --> 06:40.485
Luo Hongwu!

07:07.178 --> 07:13.059
<i>I might never have gone back to Kaili
if my father hadn't died.</i>

07:14.936 --> 07:21.859
<i>It seems now that everything began
with the death of a friend.</i>

07:25.738 --> 07:29.409
<i>His nickname was Wildcat,
and he was always dodging gambling debts.</i>

07:30.827 --> 07:32.286
<i>The last time I saw him,</i>

07:32.495 --> 07:36.457
<i>I helped him pull a cart of apples
he was going to sell that night</i>

07:36.666 --> 07:39.168
<i>to a man named Zuo Hongyuan.</i>

07:39.377 --> 07:41.754
<i>But I'd just gotten divorced at the time.</i>

07:42.296 --> 07:44.048
<i>I was a little forgetful.</i>

07:45.341 --> 07:49.595
<i>When I remembered those apples,
they were already rotten.</i>

07:51.931 --> 07:55.935
<i>Later, my ex-wife's friend,
an auxiliary police officer,</i>

07:56.769 --> 08:00.731
<i>told me Wildcat's body
was found in a mine shaft.</i>

08:03.109 --> 08:05.987
<i>While I was cleaning up the rotten apples,</i>

08:06.195 --> 08:08.573
<i>I found a gun there.</i>

08:09.782 --> 08:11.742
<i>After that...</i>

08:13.286 --> 08:15.872
<i>I always found myself attracted to danger.</i>

09:21.020 --> 09:22.605
Before your father died,

09:22.813 --> 09:25.775
he always drank alone
in front of that broken clock.

09:28.069 --> 09:29.862
I couldn't get him to stop.

09:38.496 --> 09:41.624
In his will,

09:41.832 --> 09:47.004
he left you the van
and left me the restaurant.

09:47.213 --> 09:49.465
That's okay with you, right?

09:53.761 --> 09:57.139
He once told me that you were away
working all this time.

09:57.348 --> 09:58.975
Is that right?

10:00.476 --> 10:02.645
I was managing a casino.

10:06.816 --> 10:10.194
I'm going to remodel the restaurant.

10:11.946 --> 10:14.907
Do you have anywhere else to stay?

10:21.038 --> 10:25.209
Best not change the sign.
That's my mother's name.

10:33.718 --> 10:36.095
FENG RESTAURANT

10:51.902 --> 10:54.989
<i>Over the next week,
Kaili will see persistent periods of rain,</i>

10:55.197 --> 10:58.075
<i>with heavy downpours,</i>

10:58.284 --> 11:01.287
<i>turning into thunderstorms in some areas.</i>

11:01.495 --> 11:04.832
<i>The risk of landslides and mudslides
in these areas is high.</i>

11:05.041 --> 11:07.960
<i>Please exercise caution on the road.</i>

13:25.431 --> 13:28.017
TAI ZHAOMEI
0851-82709507

14:07.807 --> 14:09.892
<i>After Wildcat died,</i>

14:10.309 --> 14:14.605
<i>I saw his ghost on the train.</i>

14:17.316 --> 14:20.945
<i>Perhaps we'd gone through
a very long tunnel</i>

14:21.153 --> 14:23.239
<i>and I was hallucinating.</i>

14:25.533 --> 14:27.827
<i>It was the summer solstice.</i>

14:28.702 --> 14:31.288
<i>That day,
the noonday sun was at its zenith.</i>

14:33.123 --> 14:37.127
<i>Zuo Hongyuan had vanished from Kaili...</i>

14:39.547 --> 14:41.924
<i>but I had tracked down his lover.</i>

14:45.594 --> 14:48.222
<i>Assuming it wasn't a hallucination...</i>

14:49.890 --> 14:53.936
<i>I also remember that a mudslide...</i>

14:55.729 --> 14:57.857
<i>had stopped the train.</i>

15:10.995 --> 15:12.621
Got a light?

16:04.757 --> 16:06.926
I don't know where he is.

16:08.052 --> 16:10.095
The police are looking for him, too.

16:53.639 --> 16:56.141
You thought I was afraid of you?

17:01.188 --> 17:04.358
<i>The number you have dialed does not exist.</i>

17:04.566 --> 17:07.111
<i>Please check the number and try again.</i>

17:13.826 --> 17:16.286
- Give me a phone card.
- For 50 yuan or 100?

17:16.494 --> 17:17.871
Whatever.

18:01.373 --> 18:07.880
<i>I don't know how a detective
investigates a strange woman.</i>

18:09.381 --> 18:12.051
<i>So I took her back to the Feng restaurant.</i>

18:13.135 --> 18:17.139
<i>My mom once told me
that when people are eating,</i>

18:17.347 --> 18:19.475
<i>they're too distracted to lie.</i>

18:21.560 --> 18:24.313
<i>Wildcat was a liar from an early age.</i>

18:25.397 --> 18:29.151
<i>He took advantage of my trust in him
to involve me in dangerous deals...</i>

18:30.569 --> 18:34.323
<i>and he tried to extort money
using the secret behind the gun.</i>

18:36.950 --> 18:39.411
<i>I didn't keep questioning her.</i>

18:39.620 --> 18:42.915
<i>I thought that was the end of the story...</i>

18:44.875 --> 18:47.878
<i>but it was only the beginning.</i>

18:52.925 --> 18:55.052
<i>That night at dinner...</i>

18:56.095 --> 19:00.849
<i>her makeup reminded me
of a photo of my mother.</i>

19:03.560 --> 19:05.854
<i>I remember it said on the calendar,</i>

19:06.063 --> 19:09.024
<i>"Today, the noonday sun is at its zenith."</i>

19:09.983 --> 19:11.902
<i>After that,</i>

19:12.611 --> 19:17.658
<i>the days grow shorter
and the nights longer.</i>

19:51.859 --> 19:53.819
You said I could leave after we ate.

19:54.945 --> 19:56.905
Why are you still following me?

20:01.410 --> 20:02.786
I think...

20:04.371 --> 20:07.916
you look a lot like someone I know.

20:22.764 --> 20:24.933
I'm not falling for that old trick.

20:26.435 --> 20:28.020
What is it you want?

20:28.604 --> 20:29.980
I mean it.

20:36.486 --> 20:39.865
She disappeared
when I was only a few years old.

20:41.867 --> 20:43.577
I remember that day.

20:44.745 --> 20:46.705
There was a fire nearby.

20:48.373 --> 20:49.625
Look.

21:12.648 --> 21:14.358
For some reason...

21:15.984 --> 21:18.987
I remember, in the photo,
her makeup was smeared, too.

21:24.868 --> 21:26.995
The train was rocking.

21:27.955 --> 21:30.207
It made a mess of my face.

21:36.630 --> 21:38.590
You're not from Kaili, are you?

21:39.549 --> 21:41.134
How do you know?

21:43.428 --> 21:45.013
Your accent.

21:46.515 --> 21:48.767
I've got a Kaili accent.

21:51.270 --> 21:54.856
Your name, say it in the Kaili dialect.

21:55.190 --> 21:56.858
Wan Qiwen.

22:01.655 --> 22:03.365
Wan Qiwen.

22:07.995 --> 22:09.997
Sounds like a movie star's name.

22:24.928 --> 22:26.972
How much longer will you follow me?

22:31.810 --> 22:36.064
Did I frighten you today?

23:00.672 --> 23:04.051
How can I make it up to you?

23:08.263 --> 23:10.223
I want to eat a pomelo fruit.

23:15.771 --> 23:18.065
Where can I get a pomelo in summer?

23:19.066 --> 23:20.901
Let's make a deal.

23:25.614 --> 23:27.949
If I can find a wild pomelo...

23:29.659 --> 23:32.037
help me make a wish come true.

24:12.911 --> 24:13.995
Hello?

24:14.621 --> 24:15.622
<i>Luo Hongwu.</i>

24:15.831 --> 24:20.001
<i>That nonworking number once belonged
to a women's prison in Guiyang.</i>

24:20.210 --> 24:21.920
<i>Has something happened?</i>

24:22.129 --> 24:25.090
Nothing. Just off to see a friend.

24:25.715 --> 24:27.175
Hey, Pager.

24:28.677 --> 24:32.764
Could your husband get me a permit
to get inside the prison?

24:34.516 --> 24:35.475
<i>Sure.</i>

24:36.768 --> 24:37.853
Good.

26:18.453 --> 26:19.955
Tai ZHAOMEI?

26:30.840 --> 26:32.592
Are you Tai ZHAOMEI?

26:34.052 --> 26:35.262
I am.

26:38.181 --> 26:40.517
Do you know Wan Qiwen?

26:43.520 --> 26:44.813
No.

26:47.190 --> 26:50.694
Did you once mail a photo
to the Feng restaurant?

26:54.281 --> 26:55.615
I don't recall.

27:17.387 --> 27:19.055
This photo.

27:21.266 --> 27:24.019
So she left you her green book.

27:26.271 --> 27:29.274
We were only 15 or 16 at the time.

27:30.775 --> 27:33.111
We'd never stolen anything before.

27:35.238 --> 27:38.450
We had watched this house for a long time.

27:40.577 --> 27:42.162
Then finally, one day...

27:44.414 --> 27:46.708
we saw that the couple had gone out.

27:48.543 --> 27:54.841
So that night,
we broke their door down and ran in.

27:56.593 --> 27:59.387
She was holding the flashlight...

28:00.847 --> 28:02.766
and shone it all around.

28:04.225 --> 28:08.647
She told us she'd discovered
that the house could spin.

28:10.106 --> 28:13.693
So we all sat down
and kept perfectly still,

28:13.902 --> 28:15.612
like a bunch of idiots.

28:16.237 --> 28:18.740
We wasted a lot of time waiting.

28:20.784 --> 28:23.745
Then we started going through their stuff.

28:25.830 --> 28:31.670
We found some rings, necklaces,
gold, and money.

28:34.255 --> 28:37.384
But just then, the couple came back.

28:38.968 --> 28:40.679
We all panicked.

28:42.013 --> 28:43.598
We didn't know what to do.

28:47.394 --> 28:48.853
In that instant...

28:50.522 --> 28:57.445
we decided we'd each grab
the most valuable thing we could and run.

28:59.447 --> 29:02.951
When we got out into the woods
to divide it all up,

29:03.159 --> 29:06.830
we saw that she had come out
with only a book.

29:08.915 --> 29:12.043
We stayed in the woods and read it.

29:13.670 --> 29:15.714
It was a love story.

29:17.340 --> 29:19.217
We only heard half the story...

29:20.593 --> 29:22.595
but we all liked it a lot.

29:23.972 --> 29:30.520
And she told us that she'd save the book
for the person she liked most.

29:51.541 --> 29:52.959
And this photo?

29:55.420 --> 29:59.507
How did you get it?

30:00.842 --> 30:02.719
She gave it to me.

30:02.927 --> 30:05.138
There's a funny story behind it.

30:06.264 --> 30:08.558
Mr. Ace tricked us into going to Kaili.

30:09.392 --> 30:11.686
He sold her to a man with bald spots...

30:13.396 --> 30:15.648
who liked her singing voice.

30:16.357 --> 30:19.152
When she left with him,
I asked her if she was upset.

30:20.403 --> 30:24.574
She replied, "Why should I be upset?

30:24.783 --> 30:28.536
I can go to the movies with him."

30:29.120 --> 30:34.918
She only regretted it a little that she
hadn't taken a photo of herself first.

30:35.794 --> 30:40.465
She didn't know what kind of person
she would become.

30:41.841 --> 30:44.844
Twelve years ago--

30:45.053 --> 30:49.516
I think it was her birthday--
she came to visit me.

30:51.059 --> 30:56.648
As she was leaving,
she asked me if the photo looked like her.

30:57.732 --> 30:59.359
I said no.

31:01.569 --> 31:04.113
Then she left it with me.

31:05.657 --> 31:08.827
Later, all of us were arrested.

31:11.079 --> 31:15.291
Around the time of the Spring Festival,
I met a prisoner from Kaili.

31:15.500 --> 31:17.460
She looked at that photograph

31:18.378 --> 31:21.214
and told me the address of the place
where the photo was taken.

31:22.173 --> 31:24.008
So I mailed it there.

31:25.343 --> 31:27.470
Maybe she had already left.

31:32.392 --> 31:34.352
What did they lock you up for?

31:38.982 --> 31:40.149
Plenty.

31:44.153 --> 31:47.031
Theft, fraud...

31:48.283 --> 31:50.076
making fake ID's.

31:52.495 --> 31:54.789
I don't know where she is either.

31:55.832 --> 31:57.792
You knew her better than I did.

31:58.918 --> 32:01.629
I want to give you this book.

32:53.514 --> 32:56.059
Do you believe the love story in the book?

32:57.560 --> 32:59.771
And that if you say the spell
on the first page,

33:00.438 --> 33:03.107
the lovers' house will begin to spin?

33:27.048 --> 33:28.216
Hold it!

33:35.682 --> 33:37.392
I told you to stop!

33:39.477 --> 33:40.770
What is it?

33:45.441 --> 33:46.901
It's from Tai ZHAOMEI.

33:48.361 --> 33:49.487
Thanks.

35:10.401 --> 35:13.029
<i>She was always disappearing
and reappearing...</i>

35:14.864 --> 35:18.242
<i>as mysterious as that abandoned house.</i>

35:20.161 --> 35:24.665
<i>Besides our trysts,
we always went to see movies.</i>

35:25.708 --> 35:31.422
<i>The difference between a movie and memory
is that movies are always false.</i>

35:32.715 --> 35:35.468
<i>In a movie,
one scene follows after another.</i>

35:37.011 --> 35:39.263
<i>But memories mix truth and lies.</i>

35:40.431 --> 35:42.642
<i>They appear and vanish before our eyes.</i>

36:18.386 --> 36:21.264
CHEN HUIXIAN, PANGHAI COUNTY, GUIZHOU

36:25.309 --> 36:29.814
Isn't that the name of a Cantopop singer?

36:30.273 --> 36:32.567
Plenty of people have the same name.

36:35.528 --> 36:39.240
There are two people named Chen HUIXIAN
in PANGHAI.

36:41.450 --> 36:43.411
One's a lot older.

36:45.913 --> 36:48.207
Her registration records end in 1999.

37:03.973 --> 37:05.641
The other Chen...

37:07.602 --> 37:11.147
she's 36, married.

37:13.191 --> 37:15.151
That's all I know.

37:24.368 --> 37:25.953
And her husband?

37:32.293 --> 37:34.045
His name is Wang Zhicheng.

37:35.755 --> 37:39.008
He runs a hotel
next to a gas station in PANGHAI.

38:48.077 --> 38:49.870
They've already left.

38:53.958 --> 38:59.171
There's something
I'm not sure I should tell you.

39:04.927 --> 39:09.307
Everything about you is a mystery.

39:46.761 --> 39:48.346
I'm pregnant.

40:02.651 --> 40:05.780
I have a feeling it's a boy.

40:16.624 --> 40:20.461
A boy who would grow up to be an athlete.

40:23.672 --> 40:27.426
I'll teach him to play Ping-Pong.

40:36.352 --> 40:37.686
Don't worry.

40:43.234 --> 40:45.403
While I was gone last time...

40:48.322 --> 40:50.282
I had an abortion.

40:54.078 --> 40:55.246
Why?

40:56.414 --> 40:58.707
Zuo is coming back to Kaili.

41:01.252 --> 41:06.132
Why don't we leave Kaili...

41:07.925 --> 41:09.927
go someplace far away?

41:10.803 --> 41:12.763
You think I don't want to?

41:16.308 --> 41:20.312
Everything you're thinking,
I've already thought about.

41:27.069 --> 41:29.822
There was one time...

41:31.449 --> 41:33.534
when Zuo was singing a karaoke song,

41:33.742 --> 41:36.996
he turned to me with the microphone
and said...

41:40.374 --> 41:44.211
"No matter where you run...

41:48.340 --> 41:50.384
I will always find you."

41:53.554 --> 41:55.764
Every time I remember that,

41:55.973 --> 41:57.600
I know...

42:00.269 --> 42:03.981
no matter what,
I'll never escape in this lifetime.

42:11.655 --> 42:13.240
You have to believe in me...

42:15.659 --> 42:17.828
like you believe in that spell.

42:32.343 --> 42:33.844
Luo Hongwu.

42:37.640 --> 42:39.475
We cannot survive...

42:41.143 --> 42:43.437
unless we hide away together
among the stars.

42:57.535 --> 43:02.790
Some people said
the world would end in 1999.

43:05.417 --> 43:07.586
Now it's the year 2000.

43:08.963 --> 43:11.465
And we're all still fucking alive.

43:27.189 --> 43:31.277
I have a friend
who runs a casino in Burma.

43:35.364 --> 43:36.991
Go back and wait for me.

43:40.786 --> 43:44.790
Pack your things overnight. Then we'll go.

45:39.446 --> 45:41.407
KAILI - PANGHAI

45:48.330 --> 45:50.124
What's that sound?

45:50.332 --> 45:52.167
No idea. I'll check later.

45:54.837 --> 45:57.548
Show me your license.

47:25.010 --> 47:27.221
<i>Falling in love with you</i>

47:28.138 --> 47:31.642
<i>I erase everything</i>

47:31.975 --> 47:38.232
<i>I hold my breath
Silently, secretly, gently</i>

47:39.191 --> 47:41.735
<i>Is it really so?</i>

47:41.944 --> 47:46.281
<i>I know you are leaving me</i>

47:46.490 --> 47:50.202
<i>But I cannot stop</i>

47:50.410 --> 47:53.288
<i>The tears falling down</i>

48:23.193 --> 48:25.779
<i>Falling in love with you</i>

48:26.405 --> 48:29.825
<i>I erase everything</i>

48:30.033 --> 48:36.748
<i>I hold my breath
Silently, secretly, gently</i>

48:37.374 --> 48:39.835
<i>Is it really so?</i>

48:40.043 --> 48:44.381
<i>I know you are leaving me</i>

48:44.590 --> 48:48.051
<i>But I cannot stop</i>

48:48.260 --> 48:51.471
<i>The tears falling down</i>

49:46.318 --> 49:47.611
Boss.

49:48.570 --> 49:49.988
You scared me to death.

49:50.197 --> 49:52.157
It's fake. Why so jumpy?

49:55.661 --> 49:57.621
All you do all day is sleep.

49:58.455 --> 50:01.208
The TV's broken,
but you won't get it fixed.

50:01.959 --> 50:04.378
No one watches TV these days.

50:04.586 --> 50:06.338
Bag anything today?

50:07.506 --> 50:11.343
The dog has no stamina,
and it gets overheated.

50:12.511 --> 50:16.056
Always sniffing the ground,
and the ground is hot.

50:16.264 --> 50:18.308
Even running makes it dizzy.

50:19.142 --> 50:22.145
Boss, someone's waiting for you.

50:33.031 --> 50:34.616
What do you want?

50:36.952 --> 50:38.745
I'm looking for someone.

50:48.630 --> 50:50.340
What are you to her?

50:51.341 --> 50:53.176
A friend from Kaili.

50:56.847 --> 50:57.806
Kaili!

51:01.435 --> 51:02.394
Kaili!

51:09.317 --> 51:10.277
Kaili!

51:15.699 --> 51:19.745
Dad, Kaili ran off with my egg!

51:24.207 --> 51:26.001
Are you Luo Hongwu?

51:52.903 --> 51:56.907
<i>Since the day we were found out...</i>

51:58.658 --> 52:01.536
<i>I worried about the people
flying away to the stars.</i>

52:03.080 --> 52:05.165
<i>They must be so exhausted...</i>

52:06.875 --> 52:12.047
<i>with nothing to lean on, nowhere to rest.</i>

53:17.112 --> 53:18.822
Have you made up your mind?

53:20.115 --> 53:21.700
The water's freezing.

53:45.140 --> 53:47.100
I'm afraid I'll fail.

54:07.245 --> 54:09.206
It's so dark in the movie theater.

54:09.831 --> 54:12.626
If you fire at the same time
as the killer on the screen...

54:14.336 --> 54:17.464
everyone will think it was a sound effect.

54:20.091 --> 54:24.304
We'll leave Kaili
and use his money to open a hotel.

54:24.512 --> 54:27.140
We'll find those lights
that look like the sun

54:27.349 --> 54:29.267
and put them up outside the hotel.

54:29.476 --> 54:32.103
And the guests will sleep
free from nightmares.

54:48.620 --> 54:51.206
Ever since she moved in,

54:51.414 --> 54:55.585
she stayed locked inside
and never went out.

54:58.588 --> 55:00.090
Spit it out!

55:01.925 --> 55:05.178
When she ran out of money to pay...

55:06.638 --> 55:10.976
she'd tell me a story every day
in place of the rent.

55:15.105 --> 55:16.731
She told me stories...

55:21.820 --> 55:23.530
until we got married.

55:41.214 --> 55:42.924
Will she be back tonight?

55:47.345 --> 55:49.681
We just finalized the divorce.

55:52.559 --> 55:56.646
One day,
she told me she was going for a walk.

55:59.566 --> 56:01.651
And she never came back.

56:04.988 --> 56:06.990
Do you ever hear from her?

56:14.998 --> 56:17.459
She sings in a karaoke parlor in Dangmai.

56:19.085 --> 56:24.215
After she left,
I'd occasionally go to hear her sing.

56:27.594 --> 56:30.555
And it was always that same song.

56:32.807 --> 56:35.810
Later, I went less and less often.

56:56.122 --> 56:58.500
Is that child yours?

57:06.841 --> 57:09.094
She was a master storyteller.

57:09.302 --> 57:12.972
I didn't know what was real
and what was false.

57:17.602 --> 57:23.066
Anyway, she told me
that she had been born infertile.

58:06.359 --> 58:08.736
HAIRDRESSING - PERMS

59:17.972 --> 59:19.349
Need a haircut?

59:19.724 --> 59:20.892
Our water's off.

01:00:18.032 --> 01:00:21.286
You haven't been here since Wildcat died.

01:00:22.078 --> 01:00:25.373
And now you show up like some detective.

01:00:27.166 --> 01:00:29.961
Why are you asking
about that killer's girlfriend?

01:00:31.588 --> 01:00:34.674
She took something valuable from me.

01:00:36.175 --> 01:00:38.428
You'd better stay away from her.

01:00:39.762 --> 01:00:44.517
Back then, Zuo borrowed a gun from
Wildcat's father to kill a man for her.

01:00:45.310 --> 01:00:48.062
Then she became his lover.

01:00:48.271 --> 01:00:53.026
But later, I heard that she had affairs
with several men.

01:00:53.776 --> 01:00:55.570
That's all I know about her.

01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:04.746
When I was a kid...

01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:10.877
there was a beekeeper
who lived next door for a while.

01:01:11.419 --> 01:01:17.550
My mom would sneak over there
and bring me back lots of honey.

01:01:20.595 --> 01:01:22.263
Your mother wasn't stung?

01:01:24.098 --> 01:01:27.852
Beekeepers
wear special protective clothing.

01:01:29.729 --> 01:01:34.233
My mom said all you had to do
was light a smoky torch

01:01:34.442 --> 01:01:36.402
and the bees would disperse.

01:01:46.287 --> 01:01:48.498
<i>Sometimes when she didn't get any,</i>

01:01:48.706 --> 01:01:52.627
<i>she'd be upset and eat an apple.</i>

01:01:54.128 --> 01:01:59.175
<i>I remember she told me
that when people were very sad,</i>

01:01:59.384 --> 01:02:03.930
<i>they would eat an apple--
the whole thing, core and all.</i>

01:04:00.797 --> 01:04:04.050
<i>The Kaili weather channel issued
a red-alert storm warning</i>

01:04:04.258 --> 01:04:06.135
<i>at 6:14 p.m. today.</i>

01:04:06.344 --> 01:04:09.305
<i>Kaili will see more than
50 millimeters of precipitation</i>

01:04:09.514 --> 01:04:10.556
<i>over the next three days,</i>

01:04:10.765 --> 01:04:13.100
<i>bringing severe danger of mudslides.</i>

01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:16.687
<i>Mudslides are a disastrous
geological phenomenon</i>

01:04:16.896 --> 01:04:19.524
<i>often associated with flooding
in mountainous regions</i>

01:04:19.732 --> 01:04:23.945
<i>and tend to strike suddenly,
carrying with them massive boulders.</i>

01:04:25.154 --> 01:04:28.991
If the storm does hit soon...

01:04:31.369 --> 01:04:32.954
what will you do?

01:04:33.746 --> 01:04:35.915
Weather forecasts are often wrong.

01:04:41.254 --> 01:04:44.298
Do you remember how to dye hair?

01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:49.428
I taught you, but you must have forgotten.

01:04:52.056 --> 01:04:55.768
When you were here in the shop,
you never worked very hard.

01:04:55.977 --> 01:04:58.437
Always hanging out with Wildcat.

01:04:58.646 --> 01:05:03.150
Actually, when we snuck out together,
I went with him to visit his father.

01:05:03.985 --> 01:05:08.322
When we were kids, he lied and told me

01:05:08.531 --> 01:05:11.868
his dad had an awesome nickname--
the Eagle.

01:05:13.703 --> 01:05:18.040
Later, I found out
that his father was in prison.

01:05:19.876 --> 01:05:21.878
Guess what color I'm gonna dye my hair.

01:05:23.045 --> 01:05:27.383
Maybe a color
that only shows up in the sunshine?

01:05:31.804 --> 01:05:34.181
What color would your mother choose?

01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:37.476
I don't know.

01:05:38.102 --> 01:05:39.729
Maybe red.

01:05:39.937 --> 01:05:41.314
Red?

01:05:42.398 --> 01:05:45.776
Nonsense. Who wants red hair?

01:05:46.903 --> 01:05:48.779
I still think it's too dangerous.

01:05:49.363 --> 01:05:54.994
When I was on the train, a mudslide
forced us to turn back to Kaili.

01:05:57.747 --> 01:06:02.501
It's living in the past that's scary,
not mudslides.

01:06:15.348 --> 01:06:18.225
<i>I no longer remember
what that movie was called.</i>

01:06:19.644 --> 01:06:25.066
<i>And I don't remember
if she gave me that green book</i>

01:06:25.733 --> 01:06:28.569
<i>or simply forgot it on top of the wall.</i>

01:06:30.655 --> 01:06:34.033
<i>I only remember that when
I returned to that leaky house...</i>

01:06:35.618 --> 01:06:37.578
<i>she was already gone.</i>

01:06:39.538 --> 01:06:41.415
<i>And that night...</i>

01:06:42.625 --> 01:06:45.962
<i>I memorized the spell...</i>

01:06:47.421 --> 01:06:49.799
<i>that would make the house spin.</i>

01:06:52.176 --> 01:06:53.552
<i>But...</i>

01:06:54.971 --> 01:06:57.640
<i>even if it really did spin,</i>

01:06:58.599 --> 01:07:00.393
<i>so what?</i>

01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:56.759
Hey there. Want to play?

01:09:00.261 --> 01:09:02.305
Is the karaoke parlor open at night?

01:09:02.515 --> 01:09:04.390
We open at 9:00.

01:09:05.017 --> 01:09:06.644
We can make you happy.

01:09:08.104 --> 01:09:11.357
Will the singers on the poster be there?

01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:14.859
It's their last night.
The place is being torn down at dawn.

01:09:40.719 --> 01:09:43.764
One song, you get a fruit plate.
Three, you get a girl.

01:09:45.099 --> 01:09:47.225
Is there a singer here called Wan Qiwen?

01:09:47.434 --> 01:09:51.729
Wan Qiwen, Meng Tingwei, Momoe Yamaguchi--
they're all here.

01:09:55.025 --> 01:09:57.319
Does Wan Qiwen sing Japanese songs?

01:09:57.528 --> 01:09:59.822
They sing whatever you want.

01:10:02.575 --> 01:10:04.118
How old is the singer?

01:10:04.326 --> 01:10:06.245
At night, who can tell?

01:10:08.289 --> 01:10:10.749
What's painted on the parlor wall?

01:10:11.375 --> 01:10:14.795
We'll be open in three hours.
Go see a movie, relax a bit.

01:10:15.004 --> 01:10:16.797
See for yourself when you come back.

01:14:29.508 --> 01:14:31.885
WINTER SOLSTICE

01:16:12.945 --> 01:16:14.154
Who are you?

01:16:21.036 --> 01:16:22.996
I was going to ask you the same thing.

01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:29.836
I'm lost.

01:16:32.714 --> 01:16:34.424
What's with the lamp?

01:16:34.633 --> 01:16:37.886
Lost, huh? You look pretty shifty to me.

01:16:46.853 --> 01:16:48.564
Where'd you come from?

01:16:52.985 --> 01:16:55.195
I fell asleep in a movie theater.

01:16:55.988 --> 01:16:59.408
When I woke up,
everyone had left the theater.

01:17:01.827 --> 01:17:05.664
It was pitch dark in there, like a maze.

01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:09.334
I followed a narrow passageway

01:17:10.252 --> 01:17:13.380
and found myself in this cave.

01:17:15.090 --> 01:17:18.844
Only porn theaters are built like that.

01:17:21.221 --> 01:17:23.807
- You know it all, don't you?
- Of course.

01:17:29.605 --> 01:17:32.399
- You know the way out of this maze?
- No idea.

01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:53.086
Why are you burning that photo?

01:17:56.131 --> 01:18:00.719
Looks like I'm stuck here for the night.

01:18:02.971 --> 01:18:04.973
But tonight's my last chance to see her.

01:18:05.849 --> 01:18:08.852
Moping won't do you any good.
I was just fooling.

01:18:09.269 --> 01:18:12.356
Beat me at Ping-Pong
and I'll take you out of here.

01:18:18.612 --> 01:18:19.946
Ping-Pong?

01:18:20.155 --> 01:18:21.114
Scared?

01:18:24.493 --> 01:18:28.121
That door with the map on it,
bring it over. Just lift it up a bit.

01:18:30.499 --> 01:18:31.792
You're not fooling?

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.128
I drew that map. What do you think?

01:19:04.783 --> 01:19:05.992
Hurry up!

01:19:31.476 --> 01:19:34.771
- What are the rules?
- Rules? Look at us!

01:19:36.064 --> 01:19:37.232
Change sides.

01:19:37.691 --> 01:19:39.276
You talk too much.

01:19:40.902 --> 01:19:42.487
We play the proper way.

01:19:45.824 --> 01:19:47.200
I'll serve first.

01:19:48.744 --> 01:19:50.412
Think I'm scared of you?

01:19:53.498 --> 01:19:54.666
Come on!

01:19:56.877 --> 01:19:59.004
You can't even serve right.

01:19:59.921 --> 01:20:00.964
Come on.

01:20:06.636 --> 01:20:07.888
Come on.

01:20:14.311 --> 01:20:15.687
Rubbish!

01:20:19.816 --> 01:20:22.235
- I'm playing for real now.
- Come on, serve.

01:20:27.991 --> 01:20:29.659
What kind of serve was that?

01:20:29.868 --> 01:20:31.286
Spin serve.

01:20:31.495 --> 01:20:33.455
Spin serve. Again!

01:20:38.585 --> 01:20:39.878
All right then.

01:20:45.425 --> 01:20:46.635
Give up?

01:20:47.928 --> 01:20:49.095
I lose.

01:20:50.722 --> 01:20:52.808
Spin serve. Goddamn.

01:20:54.643 --> 01:20:56.228
You beat me fair and square.

01:20:58.104 --> 01:20:59.689
I'll take you out of here.

01:21:04.194 --> 01:21:05.153
Catch.

01:21:06.446 --> 01:21:09.950
It'll keep you warm on the scooter.

01:21:43.984 --> 01:21:45.569
Aren't you going to lock up?

01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:48.488
You're not worried about thieves?

01:21:48.697 --> 01:21:51.992
Who'd come and steal anything besides you?

01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:54.828
Get on.

01:21:57.998 --> 01:21:59.165
Hurry it up.

01:22:13.930 --> 01:22:15.765
- Are you on?
- I'm fine.

01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:40.332
How'd you end up living in a mine?

01:22:40.916 --> 01:22:42.709
Because I'm a ghost.

01:22:43.752 --> 01:22:46.880
There are many kinds of ghosts.
Which kind are you?

01:22:47.297 --> 01:22:48.882
The most naive kind.

01:22:50.634 --> 01:22:52.677
- How old are you?
- Twelve.

01:22:54.304 --> 01:22:57.432
You lie a lot for such a young kid.

01:22:58.099 --> 01:23:00.894
- Did nobody teach you right from wrong?
- How about you?

01:23:01.519 --> 01:23:04.105
- Can I ask you a question?
- What about?

01:23:04.314 --> 01:23:05.774
Have you ever kissed a woman?

01:23:06.650 --> 01:23:09.235
Of course I have.

01:23:09.778 --> 01:23:11.446
What did it feel like?

01:23:11.655 --> 01:23:13.448
Like being in a dream.

01:23:19.871 --> 01:23:21.748
She must have been pretty.

01:23:22.791 --> 01:23:24.167
Very pretty.

01:23:25.460 --> 01:23:26.920
What did she look like?

01:23:28.088 --> 01:23:29.297
I've forgotten.

01:23:31.299 --> 01:23:33.593
Why is it so cold today?

01:23:34.678 --> 01:23:36.805
What are you talking about? It's winter.

01:23:38.890 --> 01:23:41.434
Where'd you learn to lie so much?

01:23:41.643 --> 01:23:42.769
You're the liar.

01:23:42.978 --> 01:23:45.355
How could you forget how she looked?

01:23:46.856 --> 01:23:49.234
It was a long time ago. I've forgotten.

01:23:51.277 --> 01:23:52.862
The road ahead is blocked.

01:23:54.072 --> 01:23:56.700
I'll push the scooter around it. Get off.

01:23:57.367 --> 01:24:00.286
- Whose coat is this?
- My dad's.

01:24:01.204 --> 01:24:02.622
Where's your dad?

01:24:02.831 --> 01:24:04.416
Why do you ask so many questions?

01:24:04.624 --> 01:24:06.084
How come you've got a gun?

01:24:06.626 --> 01:24:08.211
Because I'm a killer.

01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:11.172
There are many kinds of killers.
Which kind are you?

01:24:11.673 --> 01:24:13.633
The most naive kind.

01:24:22.809 --> 01:24:26.271
Go down that way and follow the high wall.

01:24:27.063 --> 01:24:30.859
Go through the prison ruins
and you'll find the way back out.

01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:33.862
Down that way?

01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:35.655
I got here from there.

01:24:35.864 --> 01:24:37.657
Find the way out yourself
if you don't believe me.

01:24:37.866 --> 01:24:40.618
This way takes you straight in.

01:24:47.208 --> 01:24:49.210
This paddle is for you.

01:24:51.421 --> 01:24:55.300
Hoping for a rematch someday?

01:24:55.508 --> 01:24:58.720
If you spin the paddle,
you can fly down there.

01:24:58.928 --> 01:25:00.305
Give it a try.

01:25:00.764 --> 01:25:06.352
You know, when a kid lies,
the moon will cut his ear off.

01:25:07.353 --> 01:25:08.938
Have a nice trip.

01:25:10.231 --> 01:25:12.901
It's so dark. Is it safe?

01:25:13.693 --> 01:25:15.820
A man should have some courage.

01:25:17.572 --> 01:25:18.573
Okay.

01:25:19.783 --> 01:25:21.951
What's your name?

01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:23.703
Why don't you give me one?

01:25:23.912 --> 01:25:25.538
No, I can't.

01:25:25.747 --> 01:25:27.916
I can't name you.
Only a father can do that.

01:25:28.708 --> 01:25:30.502
But how about a nickname?

01:25:30.710 --> 01:25:32.712
Like what-- Ping-Pong Superboy?

01:25:32.921 --> 01:25:34.089
That's cheesy.

01:25:35.673 --> 01:25:39.052
If I see you again, I'll call you Wildcat.

01:25:40.303 --> 01:25:43.389
And you'll teach me that spin serve?

01:25:44.557 --> 01:25:45.558
Sure.

01:25:46.684 --> 01:25:48.645
I'll light your way with the scooter.

01:29:22.525 --> 01:29:24.527
Hey, we're paying up!

01:29:38.207 --> 01:29:41.711
Thanks very much to our contestants!

01:29:41.919 --> 01:29:46.090
Weren't those songs enchanting?

01:29:46.966 --> 01:29:48.426
And thanks to all of you

01:29:48.634 --> 01:29:52.930
for attending tonight's
Wild Pomelo Karaoke competition.

01:29:53.473 --> 01:29:59.604
Let me remind you that we'll be selecting
a singer from among the contestants.

01:29:59.812 --> 01:30:04.192
Even you could become
a superstar overnight.

01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:07.403
Hurry up and register around the back.

01:30:50.029 --> 01:30:52.907
I'm closing up. Come back tomorrow.

01:30:56.244 --> 01:30:57.620
Are you deaf?

01:31:05.253 --> 01:31:08.423
You look a lot like a friend of mine.

01:31:11.968 --> 01:31:15.471
I'm in a bad mood tonight.
Don't bother me.

01:31:17.223 --> 01:31:20.810
I mean it. You remind me of her.

01:31:23.563 --> 01:31:24.981
What's her name?

01:31:26.023 --> 01:31:27.191
Wan Qiwen.

01:31:28.234 --> 01:31:32.405
Yeah, right. That's a movie star's name.
You think I don't know?

01:31:39.787 --> 01:31:41.456
Hey, what the hell?

01:31:43.249 --> 01:31:45.042
No scar, no mole, no tattoo.

01:31:45.251 --> 01:31:48.296
I'm not the woman you're looking for.

01:31:53.092 --> 01:31:55.344
Sorry. My mistake.

01:31:58.931 --> 01:32:01.434
I'm used to guys like you.

01:32:23.581 --> 01:32:25.917
Kaizhen! Cigarettes.

01:33:03.996 --> 01:33:06.374
When the game's over, I'm closing up.

01:33:08.668 --> 01:33:10.044
What's the rush?

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:26.352
What a wonderful night!

01:33:26.561 --> 01:33:28.729
You want to go down and give me a tune?

01:33:30.106 --> 01:33:31.857
You don't own the karaoke below.

01:33:43.244 --> 01:33:45.663
Let go of me! It hurts!

01:33:47.331 --> 01:33:49.333
I'll give you a chance.

01:33:49.542 --> 01:33:51.877
Sink this shot and you can piss off.

01:34:23.951 --> 01:34:27.580
When Jian's back,
I'll tell him you've got a new man!

01:34:32.418 --> 01:34:34.378
What are you doing back here again?

01:34:35.296 --> 01:34:37.256
Some kid tricked me.

01:34:37.965 --> 01:34:42.637
He said if I followed the prison wall,
I'd find the way out.

01:34:54.482 --> 01:34:56.275
Wait for me by the door.

01:34:58.152 --> 01:34:59.528
I'll take you down.

01:35:47.284 --> 01:35:48.953
Where's the key?

01:35:49.161 --> 01:35:50.621
On the wall there.

01:35:50.830 --> 01:35:52.289
It's not here.

01:35:58.546 --> 01:36:00.089
Locked in again.

01:36:00.673 --> 01:36:02.258
You don't have the key?

01:36:07.304 --> 01:36:09.265
Those two punks tossed it over there.

01:36:11.392 --> 01:36:13.227
Now what do we do?

01:36:13.936 --> 01:36:15.730
What do we do? We wait.

01:36:15.938 --> 01:36:18.566
We wait for someone
to come up here to play.

01:36:22.194 --> 01:36:23.362
Okay.

01:36:26.073 --> 01:36:27.742
But there's a show now.

01:36:27.950 --> 01:36:29.910
Who knows how long we'll have to wait?

01:36:32.747 --> 01:36:35.207
Then we'll wait until morning.

01:36:38.919 --> 01:36:43.132
I'm not standing up here
all night with you.

01:36:46.969 --> 01:36:51.557
By the time this song's over,
we can pry the door open.

01:36:55.478 --> 01:36:57.646
You're not a local, are you?

01:36:59.023 --> 01:37:00.608
None of your business.

01:37:04.862 --> 01:37:06.530
"Kaizhen."

01:37:08.365 --> 01:37:10.409
What does your name mean?

01:37:13.871 --> 01:37:16.248
It means "Pearl of Kaili."

01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:22.546
Kind of old-fashioned, huh?

01:37:23.214 --> 01:37:25.716
Not at all. I'm from Kaili.

01:37:34.016 --> 01:37:35.935
How about a game of pool?

01:37:36.936 --> 01:37:38.687
I'm no good at it.

01:37:38.896 --> 01:37:41.357
You run a pool hall and you can't play?

01:37:44.902 --> 01:37:47.321
This is my boyfriend's place.

01:37:57.248 --> 01:38:00.042
What the hell? Let's play.

01:38:01.168 --> 01:38:03.295
It's weird just standing here.

01:38:09.468 --> 01:38:11.387
Your boyfriend's name is Jian?

01:38:11.595 --> 01:38:12.763
Yeah.

01:38:13.514 --> 01:38:17.268
If those two start spreading rumors,
won't people get the wrong idea about you?

01:38:18.978 --> 01:38:23.232
Wrong ideas are the stuff of life.

01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:26.485
Will your boyfriend be back tonight?

01:38:31.657 --> 01:38:33.826
None of your business
whether he will or not.

01:38:38.747 --> 01:38:40.124
He's in Kaili.

01:38:41.584 --> 01:38:44.169
He's with his boss, collecting debts.

01:38:45.546 --> 01:38:51.176
He said once he's earned enough money,
he'll come for me and take me to Kaili.

01:38:52.094 --> 01:38:54.597
We'll take a plane ride.

01:38:57.558 --> 01:38:59.310
Kaili doesn't have an airport.

01:39:03.063 --> 01:39:04.857
I know he's lying.

01:39:06.066 --> 01:39:11.155
The fireworks seller down there told me
he'd seen Jian with another woman.

01:39:12.281 --> 01:39:15.910
Someone prettier than me,
someone who speaks the Kaili dialect.

01:39:17.620 --> 01:39:19.538
Why are you still waiting for him?

01:39:25.294 --> 01:39:27.838
Do you know
how to play that fruit machine?

01:39:28.047 --> 01:39:30.049
Wild pomelo is the hardest fruit to win.

01:39:33.677 --> 01:39:35.638
I made up my mind,

01:39:35.846 --> 01:39:37.973
that if I won a pomelo...

01:39:42.061 --> 01:39:43.520
I'd leave this place.

01:39:44.271 --> 01:39:46.899
Just now, after you left, I got one.

01:39:49.485 --> 01:39:51.403
Where do you want to go?

01:39:51.612 --> 01:39:54.406
If I could, I'd be a singer.

01:39:55.032 --> 01:39:57.701
I'd perform all over Guizhou...

01:39:59.411 --> 01:40:01.246
earn a lot of money

01:40:01.455 --> 01:40:03.499
and treat myself to an airplane trip.

01:40:11.382 --> 01:40:14.760
How does it feel to fly in a plane?

01:40:17.721 --> 01:40:20.391
- I get airsick.
- Airsick?

01:40:24.436 --> 01:40:26.522
Okay, the music has stopped.

01:40:31.235 --> 01:40:33.821
Can you get something
to pry open the lock?

01:40:44.957 --> 01:40:46.583
A paddle?

01:40:46.792 --> 01:40:48.919
That's how you'll get the door open?

01:40:50.004 --> 01:40:53.632
If we spin this, we can fly.

01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:56.468
Give me your hand.

01:40:57.344 --> 01:40:58.512
What for?

01:41:02.641 --> 01:41:05.102
Think I'm going to fall for that?

01:41:06.645 --> 01:41:10.357
That's not how you get to hold my hand.

01:41:12.401 --> 01:41:13.360
Hey!

01:41:14.653 --> 01:41:17.072
Let go of me! Where are you taking me?

01:41:19.533 --> 01:41:21.577
So that paddle's supposed to let us fly?

01:41:21.785 --> 01:41:23.662
You think that's going to work?

01:41:26.832 --> 01:41:28.417
And with this much wind!

01:41:29.626 --> 01:41:34.381
So if it stops spinning, will we fall?

01:41:34.590 --> 01:41:36.550
Let's give it a try.

01:43:03.971 --> 01:43:05.806
Has the moon gotten bigger?

01:43:07.724 --> 01:43:08.684
No.

01:43:10.227 --> 01:43:12.354
We're actually flying.

01:43:14.773 --> 01:43:17.526
The feeling of flying,

01:43:17.734 --> 01:43:21.488
it's like the feeling
of staying in that house.

01:43:23.198 --> 01:43:24.616
Which house?

01:43:27.327 --> 01:43:29.037
It belonged to a pair of lovers.

01:43:30.205 --> 01:43:35.169
They turned it into
the sweetest house in the world.

01:43:35.961 --> 01:43:37.504
I was so envious.

01:43:39.673 --> 01:43:42.467
Let's fly closer to the house, shall we?

01:43:44.928 --> 01:43:48.724
I've got to find that woman tomorrow.

01:43:51.226 --> 01:43:56.023
I wish she were you.

01:44:01.695 --> 01:44:04.865
- Let me down.
- Why?

01:44:08.035 --> 01:44:09.411
I'm getting airsick.

01:45:32.577 --> 01:45:35.247
There's the prison gate. You can go now.

01:45:41.044 --> 01:45:42.838
But it's not dawn yet.

01:45:43.046 --> 01:45:46.842
I'll stay long enough for a song.

01:45:48.010 --> 01:45:50.387
Go onstage and sing. Then I'll leave.

01:45:53.432 --> 01:45:54.891
No. And stop following me.

01:45:55.100 --> 01:45:56.268
Why?

01:46:02.524 --> 01:46:04.484
Go find that woman.

01:47:41.540 --> 01:47:43.250
Did your new lover dump you?

01:47:44.501 --> 01:47:45.710
None of your business.

01:48:47.647 --> 01:48:48.607
Two yuan.

01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:14.966
Got a light? A thief stole my lighter.

01:49:15.175 --> 01:49:18.136
Why would a thief steal your lighter?

01:49:19.262 --> 01:49:22.432
Look. That crazy woman is here again.

01:49:24.351 --> 01:49:26.269
How long will this sparkler burn?

01:49:26.478 --> 01:49:27.771
About a minute.

01:51:39.694 --> 01:51:40.862
Come out!

01:51:43.823 --> 01:51:45.116
Come out!

01:51:51.665 --> 01:51:53.625
How long will you keep acting crazy?

01:51:55.585 --> 01:51:57.754
How long will you keep avoiding me?

01:52:02.550 --> 01:52:05.637
My truck broke down on the road.
But I'm here, aren't I?

01:52:10.684 --> 01:52:14.896
I'll ask you one last time.
Will you come with me?

01:52:18.358 --> 01:52:21.194
You already burnt the house down.

01:52:22.612 --> 01:52:26.366
You think you have anything left
to threaten me with?

01:52:30.203 --> 01:52:32.497
That house was of no use anyway.

01:52:34.207 --> 01:52:36.835
Everything you told me was a lie!

01:52:55.687 --> 01:52:57.689
Are you really leaving with this man?

01:53:01.484 --> 01:53:03.862
Shut up. It's none of your business!

01:53:04.946 --> 01:53:06.448
Just stand there.

01:53:14.289 --> 01:53:16.124
Are you really going with him?

01:53:17.250 --> 01:53:21.212
Then tell me why you want to go with him.

01:53:22.338 --> 01:53:25.425
I can help you.

01:53:31.598 --> 01:53:33.391
I've tasted too much bitterness.

01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:37.312
At least he had sweet honey to give me.

01:53:39.481 --> 01:53:41.524
So you've made up your mind?

01:53:42.108 --> 01:53:45.862
Isn't there anyone you care about?

01:53:48.448 --> 01:53:50.950
There is someone.

01:53:51.159 --> 01:53:55.455
But he's too young to remember me.

01:54:04.047 --> 01:54:05.256
Open the gate.

01:54:07.634 --> 01:54:09.344
Come here.

01:54:11.638 --> 01:54:13.056
Hurry up.

01:54:22.357 --> 01:54:24.150
Give her the keys to the truck.

01:54:29.322 --> 01:54:30.281
Do it!

01:54:32.742 --> 01:54:36.037
Go wait in the truck.
I've got you in my sights.

01:54:46.214 --> 01:54:49.467
I was in a rush,
so I didn't bring you anything.

01:54:54.180 --> 01:54:55.974
You like apples, right?

01:55:01.729 --> 01:55:03.231
You're nuts.

01:55:21.249 --> 01:55:22.834
Do we know each other?

01:55:24.043 --> 01:55:25.003
No.

01:55:30.216 --> 01:55:31.759
Why are you crying?

01:55:33.469 --> 01:55:35.346
Why are you helping me?

01:55:38.391 --> 01:55:39.726
Because...

01:55:47.817 --> 01:55:50.445
I want your most valuable possession.

01:56:11.049 --> 01:56:13.176
This is all I have.

01:59:45.012 --> 01:59:46.097
Hey, man.

01:59:46.305 --> 01:59:47.723
Where's Kaizhen?

01:59:48.599 --> 01:59:50.184
She's backstage.

02:01:03.466 --> 02:01:06.302
I thought you'd already gone.

02:01:06.510 --> 02:01:08.596
Aren't you looking for someone?

02:01:10.223 --> 02:01:11.807
Why are you back again?

02:01:32.745 --> 02:01:34.247
This is for you.

02:01:43.798 --> 02:01:45.800
You can't just give watches to people.

02:01:46.884 --> 02:01:48.094
Why not?

02:01:51.973 --> 02:01:54.016
A watch is a symbol of eternity.

02:01:54.433 --> 02:01:55.893
And it's broken.

02:02:14.495 --> 02:02:16.330
This is for you.

02:02:18.708 --> 02:02:21.460
You can't just give fireworks to people.

02:02:23.671 --> 02:02:24.839
Why not?

02:02:26.424 --> 02:02:28.968
They're a symbol
of how brief existence is.

02:02:30.678 --> 02:02:32.847
Aren't our lives brief?

02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:41.230
How many singers are ahead of me?

02:02:45.026 --> 02:02:47.737
One more. You're the last one tonight.

02:02:53.993 --> 02:02:55.578
It's a while until dawn.

02:03:01.417 --> 02:03:04.378
I'll take you to the house
I was talking about.

02:03:06.339 --> 02:03:12.553
Do you believe
that everything I told you is true?

02:05:08.419 --> 02:05:10.713
It's completely burnt out.

02:05:21.682 --> 02:05:23.267
What happened?

02:05:40.618 --> 02:05:44.038
There used to be
a lovely crystal chandelier here.

02:05:46.165 --> 02:05:48.167
It was beautiful.

02:05:48.375 --> 02:05:50.294
I remember
the switch was on the wall there.

02:05:55.799 --> 02:05:59.678
When you turned it on, it was dazzling.

02:06:06.393 --> 02:06:08.479
That cabinet used to be locked up tight.

02:06:08.687 --> 02:06:10.648
It took me forever to get it open.

02:06:10.856 --> 02:06:15.611
The only things in there
were men's and women's clothes.

02:06:16.362 --> 02:06:18.405
There was a big dining table here.

02:06:18.614 --> 02:06:21.617
There was always
a lot of fresh fruit on the table.

02:06:22.993 --> 02:06:27.790
The ceiling always leaked. The floor too.

02:06:27.998 --> 02:06:33.963
When it rained,
the downstairs turned into a pool.

02:06:37.675 --> 02:06:42.763
One evening,
I overheard the man saying to the woman

02:06:42.972 --> 02:06:46.559
that if you recited a spell,
the house would begin to spin.

02:06:48.060 --> 02:06:49.812
Do you believe that?

02:07:09.999 --> 02:07:12.042
Do we know when we're dreaming?

02:07:14.753 --> 02:07:15.963
Maybe.

02:07:16.171 --> 02:07:19.675
On TV, they said that dreams
are lost memories.

02:07:22.386 --> 02:07:24.096
Suddenly I feel regret.

02:07:26.348 --> 02:07:27.558
About what?

02:07:29.893 --> 02:07:31.937
How short this night is.

02:07:39.278 --> 02:07:41.113
Can I kiss you?

02:07:44.908 --> 02:07:49.955
If you think the moon is bright enough.

02:07:55.252 --> 02:08:00.090
But the moon is pale tonight.

02:08:01.842 --> 02:08:06.972
Then if the house spins, you can kiss me.

02:08:08.140 --> 02:08:10.684
Using the point of a knife
to pierce the water.

02:08:10.893 --> 02:08:13.228
Examining snow with a microscope.

02:08:13.437 --> 02:08:15.731
Doing this over and over,

02:08:15.939 --> 02:08:18.150
one still wants to ask--

02:08:19.401 --> 02:08:21.945
have you counted the stars in the sky?

02:08:24.865 --> 02:08:27.034
They're like little birds...

02:08:29.203 --> 02:08:31.163
always skydiving on my chest.

02:18:48.655 --> 02:18:53.618
LONG DAY'S JOURNEY INTO NIGHT
