WEBVTT

00:01.094 --> 00:04.705
Previously, on MacGyver...

00:04.749 --> 00:07.119
I just want to give Mac and
Desi the space they deserve.

00:07.143 --> 00:07.970
Is that what you're telling yourself?

00:08.013 --> 00:09.406
Don't make me say it.

00:09.450 --> 00:10.929
I'm Auntie Gwen.

00:10.973 --> 00:13.280
File 47 is a hypothetical plan

00:13.323 --> 00:15.195
that would plunge
the world into chaos.

00:15.238 --> 00:17.023
It's a reset switch.

00:17.066 --> 00:19.068
You can't save everyone.

00:22.463 --> 00:23.594
When I fed you that lie

00:23.638 --> 00:24.745
about wanting to join Codex,

00:24.769 --> 00:25.901
you lapped it up.

00:25.944 --> 00:28.077
Of course, you were lying.

00:28.121 --> 00:30.732
Sure.

02:01.257 --> 02:03.607
Gorgeous day, isn't it?

02:05.435 --> 02:07.002
Gwen. Yeah, I am

02:07.045 --> 02:10.396
always starving after
a good nature hike.

02:10.440 --> 02:11.789
What do you say?

02:11.833 --> 02:13.513
A little breakfast
with your dear ol' aunt?

02:14.749 --> 02:18.100
Doesn't seem like
I have much of a choice.

02:19.057 --> 02:20.146
Come on, kiddo.

03:00.011 --> 03:01.970
You're here early.

03:02.013 --> 03:03.754
Or should I say late?

03:03.798 --> 03:07.062
You know we have techs
working around the clock.

03:07.105 --> 03:08.257
You really need to go home
and get some sleep.

03:08.281 --> 03:09.543
I'm concerned about Angus.

03:10.892 --> 03:13.024
I think he may have fallen
under Codex's spell.

03:13.068 --> 03:14.722
Why would you say that?

03:14.765 --> 03:16.047
Is there something
you know that I don't?

03:16.071 --> 03:18.421
No, it's just a feeling.

03:19.596 --> 03:23.296
Okay, well, since we
are sharing feelings,

03:23.339 --> 03:24.819
I'm concerned about you.

03:24.862 --> 03:26.734
Russ, listen to me.

03:26.777 --> 03:29.954
Don't mistake your pareidolia
for single-minded focus.

03:29.998 --> 03:33.044
You're brilliant,
but don't get crazy.

03:33.088 --> 03:35.960
I've made a lot of mistakes.

03:36.004 --> 03:39.007
Lost more to Codex
than I care to admit.

03:39.050 --> 03:41.662
I just don't want
to lose Mac, too.

03:41.705 --> 03:44.186
Well, there's only so much
weight any one of us can bear.

03:44.230 --> 03:45.840
It's time for next steps.

03:45.883 --> 03:47.363
What did you have in mind?

03:47.407 --> 03:48.886
Let me show you.

03:59.332 --> 04:02.117
You're eating like
this is your last meal.

04:02.160 --> 04:03.466
Mm.

04:03.510 --> 04:05.512
Help yourself.

04:05.555 --> 04:07.122
Blueberry were always
your favorite.

04:07.165 --> 04:08.993
How did you know that?

04:09.037 --> 04:10.038
You know, I remember

04:10.081 --> 04:12.214
giving you your first telescope.

04:12.258 --> 04:14.085
You used to huff it all
the way up to the roof

04:14.129 --> 04:15.565
to get a good look.

04:15.609 --> 04:17.132
Just like I used to.

04:17.175 --> 04:18.718
That telescope
that you're talking about

04:18.742 --> 04:20.309
was given to me by my father.

04:20.353 --> 04:22.050
Was it?

04:23.443 --> 04:25.880
Your father had many
admirable qualities... truth

04:25.923 --> 04:28.317
was not one of them.

04:31.451 --> 04:33.409
When Mom died...

04:33.453 --> 04:35.977
everyone said she was...

04:36.020 --> 04:38.109
looking down at me, so

04:38.153 --> 04:41.722
that telescope, in my mind,

04:41.765 --> 04:43.332
allowed me to...

04:43.376 --> 04:46.074
look back up at her, somehow.

04:46.117 --> 04:47.336
Yeah.

04:47.380 --> 04:49.382
I promised to look out for you.

04:49.425 --> 04:51.775
For her.

04:51.819 --> 04:53.386
Although...

04:53.429 --> 04:56.040
admittedly, I'm kind of the
world's worst guardian angel.

04:56.084 --> 04:58.260
You know, when you were born,

04:58.304 --> 05:00.218
you looked like
a little shriveled-up alien.

05:00.262 --> 05:02.873
Seriously ugly.
But I took one look at you,

05:02.917 --> 05:04.614
and my heart...

05:04.658 --> 05:06.399
just opened up.

05:06.442 --> 05:08.226
A biological response. Well,

05:08.270 --> 05:11.099
exactly. Key to the survival
of our species,

05:11.142 --> 05:13.144
but the feelings...

05:13.188 --> 05:15.886
The-the feeling...

05:15.930 --> 05:18.149
was surprising.

05:21.631 --> 05:23.372
Why am I here?

05:23.416 --> 05:25.113
Codex desperately
needs people like you.

05:25.156 --> 05:27.681
What, my engineering skills
make me worth saving?

05:27.724 --> 05:31.293
Yes. And besides, you're
all the family I got left.

05:32.338 --> 05:34.165
Right. You and I,

05:34.209 --> 05:37.517
together... we can rebuild.

05:37.560 --> 05:40.084
The world.

05:40.128 --> 05:41.825
Just like
your mom would have wanted.

05:41.869 --> 05:43.368
Invoking my dead mother
doesn't sell me

05:43.392 --> 05:45.089
on a plan that kills billions. The plan...

05:45.133 --> 05:47.918
Her plan... is world salvation.

05:47.962 --> 05:50.181
Well, look, if you really
want to get me on board,

05:50.225 --> 05:52.183
maybe now's the time
that you walk me through it.

05:53.446 --> 05:54.969
Nice try.

05:55.012 --> 05:57.319
You know, you have one

05:57.363 --> 05:59.365
of my top operatives... Scarlett.

05:59.408 --> 06:01.410
Her sister Ella's

06:01.454 --> 06:02.933
worried about her.

06:02.977 --> 06:05.153
She's the only family
Ella has left.

06:05.196 --> 06:06.589
She's fine.

06:06.633 --> 06:08.939
Unlike you, we don't like
to hurt innocent people.

06:08.983 --> 06:10.419
Yeah, your father

06:10.463 --> 06:13.204
has indoctrinated you to believe

06:13.248 --> 06:14.486
that you're working
for the good guys.

06:14.510 --> 06:17.600
Always owning the
moral high ground,

06:17.644 --> 06:19.646
but...

06:22.997 --> 06:24.999
It wasn't cancer
that took your mom.

06:26.348 --> 06:28.394
It was your government.

06:29.525 --> 06:31.919
The same CIA that
tried to kill me.

06:35.226 --> 06:37.272
I'm sorry. I...

06:37.315 --> 06:40.057
You must have at least suspected
l was telling you the truth.

06:41.668 --> 06:43.844
Maybe.

06:48.892 --> 06:52.287
Then you can finally see
the world the way I see it.

06:52.330 --> 06:53.984
The clock's run out.

06:54.028 --> 06:57.640
We are mere days away
from a long winter's night.

06:57.684 --> 07:00.382
And I would rather
you not be left...

07:00.426 --> 07:03.341
well, left out in the cold.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.911
That's up for you to choose.

07:07.955 --> 07:11.045
Phoenix or Codex.

07:12.655 --> 07:14.440
It's all gonna be
paper soon anyway.

07:22.796 --> 07:24.754
Has anyone seen Mac?

07:24.798 --> 07:26.582
He was gone before I woke up,

07:26.626 --> 07:28.018
and... assumed he was here.

07:28.062 --> 07:29.735
Nope, and I've been
here most of the night.

07:29.759 --> 07:31.282
Hey.

07:32.893 --> 07:34.068
Hey.

07:34.111 --> 07:35.722
What happened to you?

07:35.765 --> 07:37.593
Codex grabbed me
on my morning run.

07:37.637 --> 07:38.725
What? Yeah.

07:38.768 --> 07:40.596
It was my aunt.
What?

07:40.640 --> 07:42.511
Gwen just wanted to
have breakfast with me,

07:42.555 --> 07:43.512
but it felt like a last supper.

07:43.556 --> 07:44.774
So how did you get away?

07:44.818 --> 07:46.428
She just let me go.

07:47.385 --> 07:48.778
Right.

07:48.822 --> 07:50.693
She said we are "mere days away

07:50.737 --> 07:52.541
from a long winter's night."So whatever

07:52.565 --> 07:54.238
their plan is,
we don't have a lot of time.

07:54.262 --> 07:55.481
Riley, where are we

07:55.524 --> 07:58.005
with locating Codex's new headquarters?

07:58.048 --> 07:59.548
The number we got from
the merchant linked

07:59.572 --> 08:01.530
to a 56K hardwired modem.

08:01.574 --> 08:04.228
I'm using a brute force
attack on its encryption

08:04.272 --> 08:07.536
to isolate the network. It's not gonna be fast or guaranteed.

08:07.580 --> 08:09.538
I've been reaching out
to intelligence agencies,

08:09.582 --> 08:11.279
and things are getting
a little freaky.

08:11.322 --> 08:12.628
Well, it's the end of the world.

08:12.672 --> 08:13.910
They've got things to cross
off their bucket list.

08:13.934 --> 08:16.458
Not that kind of freaky,
you freak.

08:16.502 --> 08:17.633
Top-level scientists

08:17.677 --> 08:19.505
and military personnel
are going AWOL

08:19.548 --> 08:21.115
or-or straight-up missing.

08:21.158 --> 08:23.247
So, Codex agents
are going to ground.

08:23.291 --> 08:24.901
It's confirmation
of an imminent attack.

08:24.945 --> 08:27.382
Taylor and I are getting
on the jet to D.C.

08:27.425 --> 08:30.385
It is past time we ring alarm
bells at the highest level.

08:30.428 --> 08:31.908
No.

08:31.952 --> 08:34.017
I mean, you said it yourself...
We can't trust anybody.

08:34.041 --> 08:36.260
Certainly not the people
who murdered my mother

08:36.304 --> 08:37.871
and her whole team. But

08:37.914 --> 08:39.326
your mom died of cancer. That's what

08:39.350 --> 08:40.482
the CIA made it look like.

08:42.702 --> 08:44.573
Gwen filled me in.
Angus,

08:44.617 --> 08:46.357
Gwen's manipulating you. Look,

08:46.401 --> 08:48.316
letting in the CIA
or anybody else means

08:48.359 --> 08:50.207
more people who'll only
serve their own agendas.

08:50.231 --> 08:52.494
Mac, what would you do instead?

08:53.713 --> 08:56.498
I haven't figured that out yet. Codex is

08:56.542 --> 08:59.022
on the verge of attacking the
world, so we don't have time to

08:59.066 --> 09:00.197
not figure things out yet.

09:00.241 --> 09:01.521
I realize that.
Okay, Mac,

09:01.547 --> 09:03.026
I understand how you're feeling,

09:03.070 --> 09:04.767
but it's done.

09:04.811 --> 09:07.335
Taylor and I are calling in the
cavalry, and in the meantime,

09:07.378 --> 09:10.512
I need the four of you to use
every available resource

09:10.556 --> 09:12.470
Phoenix has to locate Codex.

09:12.514 --> 09:15.256
Starting with their operative... Scarlett.

09:15.299 --> 09:17.737
I've brought her in
for interrogation, so...

09:24.831 --> 09:26.789
Hey.

09:26.833 --> 09:28.680
What's with all the late-night
disappearing acts?

09:28.704 --> 09:30.401
You ever heard of leaving a note?

09:30.445 --> 09:32.597
I'm sorry. I've had a lot on my
mind. Let's see. My dad's dead.

09:32.621 --> 09:34.425
I killed that nice family
man at the power plant.

09:34.449 --> 09:36.427
And, oh, yeah, now my mom's
been murdered, so that's fun.

09:36.451 --> 09:38.279
That's why I'm here... to help you. Desi,

09:38.322 --> 09:41.151
there's no future for any of us
if we don't figure this out.

09:42.544 --> 09:43.589
Look...

09:45.286 --> 09:47.462
right now
what we need to focus on

09:47.505 --> 09:49.507
is just getting Scarlett
to talk.

10:04.087 --> 10:05.785
Hey, Scarlett.

10:07.438 --> 10:09.527
We really want to help you
get back to your sister,

10:09.571 --> 10:12.052
but we need to know
what Codex is planning.

10:12.095 --> 10:14.184
Help us stop them,

10:14.228 --> 10:16.273
and we are authorized to
give you whatever you need.

10:20.408 --> 10:21.801
That's the easy way.

10:21.844 --> 10:25.282
Oh, if you take these off,
I'm happy to do things

10:25.326 --> 10:26.762
the hard way.

10:26.806 --> 10:28.348
Look, I have to believe that
somewhere deep down you know

10:28.372 --> 10:29.654
that what Codex is
doing is wrong.

10:29.678 --> 10:31.506
Help us,

10:31.549 --> 10:33.856
we'll get Ella out.
We can reunite you two.

10:33.900 --> 10:36.076
Well, since we're talking
about family...

10:36.119 --> 10:37.512
what about all of you?

10:37.555 --> 10:39.993
Well, Angus here, an only child, but...

10:40.036 --> 10:42.952
Bozer was the closest thing
you had to a sibling.

10:42.996 --> 10:45.433
Desiree has a brother,
doing his residency

10:45.476 --> 10:46.869
at John Hopkins.

10:46.913 --> 10:48.566
Am I right?

10:48.610 --> 10:50.003
Yeah, you're right.

10:50.046 --> 10:52.166
Let's take those shackles off
and get to the fun part.

10:54.572 --> 10:56.444
You know, ever since
my parents were killed,

10:56.487 --> 10:59.316
my sister wanted to be a doctor.

10:59.360 --> 11:02.450
I mean, we're just soldiers

11:02.493 --> 11:03.843
who break things.

11:03.886 --> 11:06.149
Ah, but our siblings...

11:06.193 --> 11:07.803
They put it back together.

11:07.847 --> 11:09.936
You and me,

11:09.979 --> 11:11.111
we're not that different.

11:11.154 --> 11:12.479
And what's your sister think
of culling

11:12.503 --> 11:14.201
the global population?

11:14.244 --> 11:15.593
So much for "do no harm."

11:15.637 --> 11:17.726
She deserves so much better

11:17.770 --> 11:20.207
that the global climate disaster

11:20.250 --> 11:22.470
that's being left to her.

11:23.514 --> 11:25.908
How can you say
that you can protect her

11:25.952 --> 11:28.128
after what the government did

11:28.171 --> 11:30.652
to your aunt,
to your own mother?

11:30.696 --> 11:33.481
How could I possibly trust them?

11:33.524 --> 11:36.440
Gwen still thinks that
you're gonna come around.

11:36.484 --> 11:39.226
Over and over,
she was very clear:

11:39.269 --> 11:41.054
do not harm Angus.

11:41.097 --> 11:42.838
Even when it went
against orders.

11:45.275 --> 11:47.625
Gwen doesn't call the shots?

11:47.669 --> 11:49.018
No.

11:49.062 --> 11:50.779
Well, we all have to take
orders from somebody.

11:50.803 --> 11:52.152
Right, soldier?

11:52.195 --> 11:54.458
Isn't that how you justify

11:54.502 --> 11:57.113
all those people
you've killed, Desiree?

11:57.157 --> 11:58.593
Let me show you.

11:58.636 --> 12:00.551
No. Desi,

12:00.595 --> 12:01.552
let's go. You can beat me

12:01.596 --> 12:02.771
till I'm black and blue,

12:02.815 --> 12:04.512
but my loyalty is to my family.

12:04.555 --> 12:06.079
Get off of me!

12:06.122 --> 12:07.491
What are you doing?
She's about to talk,

12:07.515 --> 12:08.753
and then you nearly
take her head off?

12:08.777 --> 12:09.928
You're letting her get to you.

12:09.952 --> 12:11.475
I'm letting her get to me?

12:11.519 --> 12:12.888
Yes, you're playing
right into their hands.

12:12.912 --> 12:14.348
I'm playing right
into their hands?

12:14.391 --> 12:16.393
God, what is wrong with you?

12:16.437 --> 12:18.700
Why do you refuse to see what
is actually happening here?

12:18.744 --> 12:19.570
And what is that?

12:19.614 --> 12:21.398
You're compromised.

12:21.442 --> 12:23.879
Are you questioning my loyalty?

12:23.923 --> 12:27.143
You are so drunk on some
screwed-up cocktail of your mom,

12:27.187 --> 12:28.623
your aunt, Codex science...

12:28.666 --> 12:30.581
No, I'm not.
Things are just complicated.

12:30.625 --> 12:32.148
No, it is simple.

12:32.192 --> 12:33.802
It is us or them.

12:33.846 --> 12:35.282
Whose side are you on?

12:35.325 --> 12:37.588
I don't know what answer's
gonna get you off my back.

12:37.632 --> 12:38.894
Both? Neither?

12:38.938 --> 12:40.243
Wow.

12:42.463 --> 12:44.726
Clearly, you are not on mine.

13:07.183 --> 13:10.708
Matty, I hope you understand
this is your one and only call

13:10.752 --> 13:12.885
using the red bat phone. I understand
that, Danny,

13:12.928 --> 13:14.234
and I wouldn't waste it.

13:14.277 --> 13:16.279
But we need to mobilize
our nation's defenses

13:16.323 --> 13:17.759
like never before.

13:17.803 --> 13:18.847
Okay.

13:18.891 --> 13:20.544
FBI. NSA.

13:20.588 --> 13:23.286
ODNI. DHS.

13:23.330 --> 13:25.811
JSOC.
The whole alphabet's here.

13:25.854 --> 13:27.421
You have 90 seconds.

13:27.464 --> 13:28.639
All right, then.

13:28.683 --> 13:31.207
Let's get straight to it.

13:31.251 --> 13:33.209
This...

13:33.253 --> 13:34.863
this is Codex.

13:34.907 --> 13:37.126
A millenarianist doomsday

13:37.170 --> 13:40.216
international terrorist
organization that wraps itself

13:40.260 --> 13:43.219
in an eco-warrior ethos...

13:43.263 --> 13:44.655
You know, rather than just...

13:44.699 --> 13:47.093
rehash this brochure,
why I don't I just...

13:47.136 --> 13:48.834
jump to the good bits, hmm?

13:50.748 --> 13:53.664
Recent attacks and penetrations

13:53.708 --> 13:54.883
on sensitive facilities

13:54.927 --> 13:56.667
directed by their leader,
Gwendolyn Hayes,

13:56.711 --> 13:58.800
are soon to culminate

13:58.844 --> 14:00.715
in a global attack
that will wipe out

14:00.758 --> 14:03.718
a quarter of the
Earth's population.

14:03.761 --> 14:05.720
They believe that these attacks

14:05.763 --> 14:07.853
will save the planet
from an otherwise

14:07.896 --> 14:10.290
inevitable collapse
due to climate change.

14:11.813 --> 14:14.250
Nearly two billion people...

14:14.294 --> 14:15.773
dead.

14:17.775 --> 14:19.603
Now, we have intelligence

14:19.647 --> 14:21.605
that says this attack...

14:21.649 --> 14:23.694
is mere days away.

14:26.132 --> 14:27.916
Armageddon is

14:27.960 --> 14:30.701
scary stuff,
but where's the hard evidence?

14:30.745 --> 14:33.487
Well, they tend not to
leave anything behind, but...

14:33.530 --> 14:35.010
rest assured...

14:35.054 --> 14:36.751
this threat is real.

14:36.794 --> 14:38.405
How are they gonna do it?

14:41.756 --> 14:43.627
We don't know.

14:45.020 --> 14:46.892
Phoenix is close to finding

14:46.935 --> 14:48.806
the location
of Codex's headquarters,

14:48.850 --> 14:50.852
but we need to know
the rules of engagement

14:50.896 --> 14:53.072
and if we can rely on military support.

14:54.421 --> 14:55.813
This is exactly

14:55.857 --> 14:57.206
the kind of intransigence

14:57.250 --> 14:58.773
that has allowed Codex to recruit

14:58.816 --> 15:00.253
so many to its cause.

15:00.296 --> 15:02.777
We need to act, and act now.

15:07.303 --> 15:08.696
Yes?

15:08.739 --> 15:10.132
I hear you.

15:10.176 --> 15:11.568
Very clear.

15:13.744 --> 15:15.137
Look...

15:15.181 --> 15:17.313
the big boss had ears on us
and heard your pitch.

15:17.357 --> 15:19.402
The problem is POTUS
doesn't want to get caught

15:19.446 --> 15:21.230
holding a dookie sandwich
if you're wrong.

15:21.274 --> 15:22.884
A dookie sandwich?

15:22.928 --> 15:24.320
But, Danny,

15:24.364 --> 15:26.322
with all due respect,
this is no time for us

15:26.366 --> 15:27.758
to stick our heads in the sand.

15:33.808 --> 15:35.288
Right.

15:37.159 --> 15:38.421
Well...

15:40.554 --> 15:43.861
Plausible deniability
is a cloak I've worn before.

15:43.905 --> 15:44.950
Russ, excuse me.

15:44.993 --> 15:46.560
Mr. Taylor,
we're hereby giving you

15:46.603 --> 15:49.780
authorized authority, via
your private military company,

15:49.824 --> 15:51.739
Spearhead, to eliminate Codex.

15:51.782 --> 15:53.001
No chances taken.

15:53.045 --> 15:54.437
Understood? Gentlemen,

15:54.481 --> 15:55.675
I'm not comfortable
with the ramifications...

15:55.699 --> 15:58.485
You may assure
President Royce...

15:58.528 --> 16:00.704
that the enemy will be
chopped off at the head.

16:00.748 --> 16:02.402
I expect no less

16:02.445 --> 16:04.752
from a man of your...

16:04.795 --> 16:06.406
character.

16:15.328 --> 16:16.851
Somebody call

16:16.894 --> 16:18.026
to get the cable fixed?

16:18.070 --> 16:20.333
Riley, have you located Codex yet?

16:20.376 --> 16:21.856
I'm almost there.

16:21.899 --> 16:24.163
They're still in the western
U.S., but I need more time.

16:24.206 --> 16:25.599
Who are these guys?

16:25.642 --> 16:27.035
They're Reaper drone pilots.

16:27.079 --> 16:28.645
Good news, everyone.

16:28.689 --> 16:31.648
The president has sanctioned
Spearhead Operations

16:31.692 --> 16:33.694
to neutralize Codex.

16:33.737 --> 16:35.565
By any means necessary.

16:35.609 --> 16:36.871
Neutralize?

16:36.914 --> 16:39.004
Codex is on U.S. soil,
so to circumvent

16:39.047 --> 16:41.180
the law, it's you ordering
the missile strike

16:41.223 --> 16:42.703
instead of the president.

16:42.746 --> 16:45.619
Well, with so much at stake, all options are on the table.

16:45.662 --> 16:47.162
Look, what they're doing
is obviously very wrong,

16:47.186 --> 16:48.709
but there are good people there.

16:48.752 --> 16:51.190
There are civilians,
scientists, their families. Angus,

16:51.233 --> 16:52.887
you are distraught
by personal loss.

16:52.930 --> 16:54.889
Your vision is
completely clouded.

16:54.932 --> 16:56.301
We are all in this
fight because you

16:56.325 --> 16:57.892
wanted to make up for past sins,

16:57.935 --> 16:59.522
yet here you are,
resorting to the same method

16:59.546 --> 17:01.287
you swore off.
Okay, you two need

17:01.330 --> 17:02.916
to cool it. I'm sorry, Matty,
but this isn't

17:02.940 --> 17:05.006
how the Phoenix works...
We don't indiscriminately take

17:05.030 --> 17:07.467
innocent lives. But you're okay with Codex doing it?

17:07.510 --> 17:09.077
I don't... What are
you talking about?

17:09.121 --> 17:10.296
This.

17:10.339 --> 17:11.862
And why do you

17:11.906 --> 17:13.907
want to join Codex?

17:13.951 --> 17:15.953
Both of my parents are dead.

17:15.997 --> 17:17.912
I feel...

17:17.954 --> 17:19.521
free.

17:19.566 --> 17:22.002
Free to choose a path
of science and reason.

17:22.047 --> 17:23.396
And the whole...

17:23.439 --> 17:27.313
Codex planning on killing
billions of people...

17:27.356 --> 17:29.010
your friends...

17:29.054 --> 17:30.577
Phoenix...

17:30.620 --> 17:32.579
your girlfriend?

17:33.580 --> 17:35.756
Sometimes to do what's right

17:35.799 --> 17:38.976
you have to sacrifice
the things you love.

17:39.020 --> 17:41.936
Body language. Pupil dilation.
Electrocardio rhythms.

17:41.979 --> 17:44.504
All indicate the same thing:
that you're telling the truth.

17:44.547 --> 17:45.940
I knew it.

17:45.983 --> 17:47.028
No. I...

17:47.072 --> 17:49.117
I was playing a part. Yes, well,

17:49.161 --> 17:51.032
the data says otherwise. This is insane.

17:51.076 --> 17:53.339
Auntie Gwen got to you. You don't all believe this,

17:53.382 --> 17:54.949
do you? Riles.

17:54.992 --> 17:56.168
Boze.

17:56.211 --> 17:58.474
Unless you've been
taking acting classes...

17:58.518 --> 18:01.434
It's hard not to worry
about you, Mac.

18:01.477 --> 18:03.914
I'm sorry.

18:03.958 --> 18:06.003
But I needed to remove
all doubt, so that no one

18:06.047 --> 18:08.136
would question me
when I say to you

18:08.180 --> 18:09.703
that you are off this mission.

18:09.746 --> 18:11.444
Ma-Matty.

18:11.487 --> 18:12.967
You're not a machine, Mac.

18:13.010 --> 18:14.925
And a person
can only take so much.

18:14.969 --> 18:17.189
None of you get it.
It's... you're not...

18:17.232 --> 18:20.496
You're taking sides in
a war that nobody wins.

18:30.289 --> 18:31.551
I like your pom-pom.

18:31.594 --> 18:33.205
That's a good one.

18:40.995 --> 18:42.170
Would you excuse me?

18:42.214 --> 18:43.606
Sure.

18:46.305 --> 18:47.654
Roman.

18:47.697 --> 18:50.265
Your unsanctioned trip to
Los Angeles raised concern.

18:51.484 --> 18:54.008
Leland had you tail me.
That's lovely.

18:54.051 --> 18:55.966
I don't need a babysitter.
And you should know,

18:56.010 --> 18:57.794
muscle's easily replaced.

18:57.838 --> 18:59.187
Yeah, well, it's my job, ma'am.

18:59.231 --> 19:01.363
Head of security,
et cetera, et cetera.

19:01.407 --> 19:03.452
But you know that.
So don't take it personal.

19:03.496 --> 19:05.454
You can tell our boss

19:05.498 --> 19:07.456
that it was a
fact-finding mission.

19:07.500 --> 19:10.894
It turns out Scarlett is being
held by the Phoenix Foundation.

19:10.938 --> 19:12.069
She's alive,

19:12.113 --> 19:14.333
but... potentially compromised.

19:14.376 --> 19:15.899
Then we should up the timetable.

19:15.943 --> 19:18.902
No, Roman.
We proceed according to plan.

19:18.946 --> 19:20.208
My plan.

19:20.252 --> 19:22.210
So relax.

19:22.254 --> 19:25.170
Hang out, enjoy the sunset.

19:25.213 --> 19:28.129
It's a reminder of what
we're fighting for.

19:37.704 --> 19:40.097
I'm not saying Mac's
gone full Codex,

19:40.141 --> 19:42.250
but Taylor's always been right
with the psy-ops stuff.

19:42.274 --> 19:44.014
You're siding with
Taylor over Mac,

19:44.058 --> 19:46.365
who doesn't have an
evil bone in his body?

19:46.408 --> 19:47.627
Mac is just too good

19:47.670 --> 19:49.585
of a person to make hard choices

19:49.629 --> 19:51.021
in the best of times.

19:51.065 --> 19:52.458
Des.

19:52.501 --> 19:55.635
I think something inside him
is close to breaking.

20:03.120 --> 20:05.166
Here I am.

20:06.863 --> 20:10.171
The sum total of both of you.

20:10.215 --> 20:12.173
All the good.

20:12.217 --> 20:14.262
All the bad.

20:20.399 --> 20:23.271
You taught me
I could fix things, but...

20:25.186 --> 20:27.841
I don't know if I can this time.

20:30.539 --> 20:33.412
Really wish you guys
were here right now.

20:36.719 --> 20:39.113
Dad, you used
to always say that thing.

20:40.549 --> 20:43.857
The only real failure
is never having tried at all.

20:43.900 --> 20:45.162
So...

20:45.206 --> 20:47.339
I'm gonna try something.

20:49.515 --> 20:51.821
But it means risking everything.

20:52.866 --> 20:54.998
Everyone I love.

21:00.047 --> 21:02.223
Science is driven by cold logic,

21:02.267 --> 21:05.574
by equations you can test
and duplicate.

21:05.618 --> 21:08.011
But humankind's
greatest leaps forward

21:08.055 --> 21:10.231
were all born of instinct
and intuition,

21:10.275 --> 21:12.451
by the belief that the
impossible was within reach.

21:12.494 --> 21:16.063
So there comes a time
to put aside all logic

21:16.106 --> 21:19.240
and trust your gut
and do what you feel is right.

21:25.464 --> 21:27.074
Liftoff affirmed.

21:27.117 --> 21:28.684
Green lights
on missiles one and two.

21:29.729 --> 21:33.385
This is a last resort, correct?

21:33.428 --> 21:35.082
Of course.

21:53.492 --> 21:55.339
We got a security alert
in the interrogation room.

21:55.363 --> 21:57.060
Get Desi to meet me there.

21:58.018 --> 21:59.387
There's a high probability

21:59.411 --> 22:00.368
in the next 24 hours

22:00.412 --> 22:01.804
that the Codex base

22:01.848 --> 22:03.763
will be taken out
with a drone strike.

22:03.806 --> 22:06.853
Your sister, my aunt...
I need your help saving them.

22:06.896 --> 22:10.117
If I take you there, how do
l know you won't betray us?

22:10.160 --> 22:12.511
You don't.

22:19.822 --> 22:21.258
Angus,

22:21.302 --> 22:22.608
there's no way out, so just...

22:22.651 --> 22:24.174
just stop this.

22:24.218 --> 22:25.654
Mac,

22:25.698 --> 22:28.614
just put her back in her cell.
We can talk about this.

22:28.657 --> 22:32.008
I think we both know
it's too late for that.

22:32.052 --> 22:33.532
Don't do this.

22:39.189 --> 22:42.454
At my recommendation,
the Phoenix recently installed

22:42.497 --> 22:44.064
a hypoxic fire
prevention system,

22:44.107 --> 22:47.372
based on the simple principle
that fire needs oxygen.

22:47.415 --> 22:48.415
Wait.

22:49.461 --> 22:51.854
So, if you suck
most of the oxygen out

22:51.898 --> 22:55.684
and replace it
with nitrogen-rich air...

22:55.728 --> 22:57.991
breathing gets very hard.

23:19.012 --> 23:20.970
I'm sorry.

23:39.380 --> 23:41.817
Angus MacGyver has gone rogue.

23:41.861 --> 23:43.166
Get APBs out

23:43.210 --> 23:45.952
to every local and federal
law enforcement agency.

23:45.995 --> 23:48.302
Start running facial rec
on every camera

23:48.345 --> 23:50.565
located within a 60-mile radius.

23:50.609 --> 23:53.089
Report all progress
to Riley Davis.

23:53.133 --> 23:56.702
Angus MacGyver is now officially
an enemy of the state.

23:58.791 --> 23:59.792
Get to work.

24:10.542 --> 24:13.066
Is all this really necessary?

24:13.109 --> 24:15.851
Was leaving me and Desi without
any oxygen really necessary?

24:15.895 --> 24:17.679
There has to bean explanation.

24:17.723 --> 24:19.115
Mac does everything for a reason.

24:19.159 --> 24:20.508
Mac's not himself.

24:20.552 --> 24:22.336
He needs to be stopped
for his own good.

24:22.379 --> 24:24.164
I know only too well

24:24.207 --> 24:26.514
the evil that Codex nurtures
in even the best of us.

24:26.558 --> 24:28.821
Unfortunately,

24:28.864 --> 24:30.083
Mac is now a threat.

24:30.126 --> 24:32.128
And there's no telling

24:32.172 --> 24:33.086
what his next move will be.

24:33.129 --> 24:34.957
Desi.

24:35.001 --> 24:36.829
Put the Phoenix in lockdown.

24:44.314 --> 24:47.317
Riley, Bozer, you both know Mac best.

24:47.361 --> 24:49.842
Anticipate his moves and help
me bring him back in here

24:49.885 --> 24:51.104
before he does anything else

24:51.147 --> 24:52.540
he's gonna regret.

24:52.584 --> 24:54.455
None of us want him hurt.

24:54.499 --> 24:55.848
I'm counting on the both of you.

25:04.073 --> 25:05.553
Why the pit stop

25:05.597 --> 25:07.163
at the sketchy warehouse?

25:07.207 --> 25:08.861
A century-old secret.
A few weeks ago,

25:08.904 --> 25:10.491
Phoenix obtained a
weapon known as Shiva,

25:10.515 --> 25:11.820
made by Nikola Tesla...

25:11.864 --> 25:13.430
I know.
I was there, mans plainer

25:13.474 --> 25:16.042
Oh, yeah. Right. Well, anyways, we outfitted this building

25:16.085 --> 25:17.652
as a research facility
in the hopes

25:17.696 --> 25:19.674
that we could determine what
Codex is planning to use it for.

25:19.698 --> 25:21.134
So did you? No.

25:21.177 --> 25:23.136
I was hoping, since we're
on the same side now,

25:23.179 --> 25:25.462
you could spill the tea. I'm a soldier,
I'm not a scientist.

25:25.486 --> 25:27.532
I don't know why we want it.

25:27.575 --> 25:28.968
So we're gonna go grab it?

25:29.011 --> 25:31.231
Yeah. You're crazy.

25:31.274 --> 25:33.059
I like you.

25:33.102 --> 25:34.669
Wait.

25:34.713 --> 25:36.279
Hold on.

25:36.323 --> 25:38.586
Nothing on the west side.

25:38.630 --> 25:40.240
What you got?

25:40.283 --> 25:43.286
Hoping to catch Mac and Scarlett
stealing their getaway vehicle,

25:43.330 --> 25:45.680
so... I'm hacking doorbell cameras

25:45.724 --> 25:47.943
in the neighborhood
around the Phoenix.

25:47.987 --> 25:49.162
Smart.

25:49.205 --> 25:51.468
And disturbing that
you can do that.

25:51.512 --> 25:54.099
I can't believe we're running
a manhunt for Mac. Actually, this is

25:54.123 --> 25:55.168
my second time.

25:55.211 --> 25:56.909
In sixth grade,
he got in trouble

25:56.952 --> 25:59.259
for blowing up the
chemistry lab and ran away.

25:59.302 --> 26:01.391
The whole school went on
lockdown and a search party

26:01.435 --> 26:03.195
was formed to comb through
Mission City woods.

26:03.219 --> 26:04.177
Where'd he turn up?

26:04.220 --> 26:05.657
My house.

26:05.700 --> 26:08.355
Said he got scared and...
that's where he felt safe.

26:10.618 --> 26:12.925
Do you really think Gwen
could get into his head?

26:12.968 --> 26:14.013
Maybe.

26:14.056 --> 26:15.144
If it were me,

26:15.188 --> 26:17.190
I know she would
mess with my head.

26:18.321 --> 26:20.410
Mac's always wanted a
connection to his mom,

26:20.454 --> 26:22.108
and Gwen's giving him that.

26:27.287 --> 26:28.593
Got something?

26:28.636 --> 26:30.725
No.

26:30.769 --> 26:32.814
Mac's too smart to leave a trail.

26:32.858 --> 26:33.858
Yeah.

26:34.294 --> 26:35.034
Can you take a look at this?

26:35.077 --> 26:36.601
Mm-hmm.

26:52.704 --> 26:54.619
Hey, hey.

27:00.712 --> 27:03.105
Well, when it comes to partners, I guess I have a type.

27:03.149 --> 27:05.455
We are not partners.

27:12.506 --> 27:14.247
Knock, knock.

27:14.290 --> 27:16.684
We're here for Shiva
and we have no intention

27:16.728 --> 27:18.793
of hurting anybody. All of the emergency protocols...

27:18.817 --> 27:20.035
I designed them.

27:20.079 --> 27:21.360
So whatever you're thinking, I'm a step ahead.

27:21.384 --> 27:22.448
Look, we'd love to cooperate,

27:22.472 --> 27:24.387
but Mr. Taylor
made it very clear

27:24.431 --> 27:25.495
that you're persona non grata.

27:25.519 --> 27:26.519
Ahem.

27:28.087 --> 27:29.392
But, hey, who are we to judge?

27:29.436 --> 27:31.264
Knock yourselves out with Shiva.

27:31.307 --> 27:33.005
We literally have.

27:33.048 --> 27:34.310
A couple of times.

27:38.401 --> 27:39.533
Dude.

27:40.142 --> 27:40.882
Hold on.

27:40.926 --> 27:42.275
Before we shoot anybody,

27:42.318 --> 27:44.364
let's just... try locking 'em
in that supply closet.

27:44.407 --> 27:46.279
I'll work on the exit strategy.

27:51.197 --> 27:52.502
He's going after Shiva.

27:52.546 --> 27:54.374
Damn it, Angus.

27:55.418 --> 27:56.569
Lock down the building!

28:02.295 --> 28:03.688
Aw, come on!

28:03.731 --> 28:05.298
What now, genius?

28:05.341 --> 28:06.342
Working on it.

28:11.521 --> 28:13.523
Riles? Get in.

28:20.922 --> 28:22.489
Let's go!

28:23.098 --> 28:24.404
Hey. Stop!

28:39.549 --> 28:40.855
Looks like

28:40.899 --> 28:42.659
the ALPR blocker on the
plates is still working.

28:42.683 --> 28:44.032
Thank you.

28:44.076 --> 28:46.295
I'd hate to think where I'd be
if you hadn't shown up.

28:48.515 --> 28:49.734
Why did you do it?

28:51.736 --> 28:53.259
Because, at the end of the day,

28:53.302 --> 28:54.260
I trust you, Mac.

28:54.303 --> 28:55.783
But, seriously,

28:55.827 --> 28:57.306
man, what's going on?

28:57.350 --> 28:58.655
I know that everybody thinks

28:58.699 --> 28:59.894
that Gwen has cast
a spell on me,

28:59.918 --> 29:00.962
but look at Taylor.

29:01.006 --> 29:02.529
I can't figure it out,

29:02.572 --> 29:03.965
but he's obsessed with Codex.

29:04.009 --> 29:05.595
He pretends like there's
other options on the table.

29:05.619 --> 29:07.423
But, given the chance,
he's gonna press the button,

29:07.447 --> 29:09.231
no matter how many
innocent lives he takes.

29:10.363 --> 29:11.973
So now what?

29:12.017 --> 29:13.821
We ask your Aunt Gwen nicely
not to press her button

29:13.845 --> 29:15.803
to reset the world?

29:15.847 --> 29:18.501
I saw something in her, Riles.

29:18.545 --> 29:20.590
As estranged as we may be,

29:20.634 --> 29:22.462
I'm the only family that she has left.

29:25.508 --> 29:27.467
More importantly,

29:27.510 --> 29:29.208
she thinks
I'll join 'em. So,

29:29.251 --> 29:30.731
I use Shiva back there
to convince 'em

29:30.775 --> 29:31.732
that I've changed my mind.

29:31.776 --> 29:32.820
And once I'm inside Codex,

29:32.864 --> 29:34.604
I figure out a way to stop her.

29:34.648 --> 29:36.017
You know, without all the needless death.

29:36.041 --> 29:38.565
And how do we know
we're not walking into a trap?

29:38.608 --> 29:39.914
We don't.

29:39.958 --> 29:42.743
Gwen could welcome us with open arms, or...

29:42.787 --> 29:44.614
we could be marching to our deaths.

29:46.660 --> 29:48.159
You know you don't have to do this, right?

29:48.183 --> 29:49.315
What?

29:49.358 --> 29:50.751
And miss all the fun?

29:57.802 --> 30:01.501
If any of you had any doubts
about where Mac's loyalties lie,

30:01.544 --> 30:03.068
well, I hope they've been put to rest.

30:03.111 --> 30:04.983
There's got to be
another explanation.

30:05.026 --> 30:06.047
Then I suggest
that you find them,

30:06.071 --> 30:07.333
bring them back and ask them.

30:07.376 --> 30:09.378
Riley did a hell of a job
covering their tracks.

30:09.422 --> 30:12.425
I mean, no phone signals, no GPS, no nothing.

30:12.468 --> 30:15.689
Y'all believe what you want,
but Riley left us a clue.

30:15.732 --> 30:18.092
The trace on the modem finally
pinged a location in Montana.

30:18.126 --> 30:21.173
I'm accessing
satellite coverage now.

30:24.654 --> 30:26.526
Looks like a ranch complex.

30:26.569 --> 30:28.180
We've got
multiple power sources,

30:28.223 --> 30:29.897
heat signatures
for about a hundred people.

30:29.921 --> 30:31.618
I'll start a scan of the property.

30:31.661 --> 30:34.403
No, that's Codex headquarters.
We've got them.

30:34.447 --> 30:36.666
Desi, how long to get
a tactical assault team on site?

30:36.710 --> 30:37.992
We've got to gear up,
get airborne,

30:38.016 --> 30:39.669
add in flight time, HALO in.

30:39.713 --> 30:41.323
At best, four hours.

30:41.367 --> 30:42.910
Calculating from when
Mac and Riley left

30:42.934 --> 30:44.544
the research facility.

30:44.587 --> 30:45.762
They'll get there first.

30:45.806 --> 30:47.721
And warn Gwen, which
will give enough time

30:47.764 --> 30:48.722
to evacuate Codex.

30:48.765 --> 30:51.464
Or worse, set up a defense

30:51.507 --> 30:53.640
and turn our assault
into a suicide mission.

30:53.683 --> 30:55.294
We can take what they throw at us.

30:55.337 --> 30:57.078
Or we can call Washington
for other options.

30:57.122 --> 30:58.079
No, Matilda.

30:58.123 --> 30:59.254
Chain of command was clear.

30:59.298 --> 31:00.690
Cut off the head of the snake.

31:00.734 --> 31:02.823
How long before you can get
the Reaper in position?

31:02.867 --> 31:04.496
At top speed, we can get
to these coordinates

31:04.520 --> 31:05.478
in roughly an hour.

31:05.521 --> 31:06.566
All right.
Get on it.

31:06.609 --> 31:07.959
Uh, hold up.

31:08.002 --> 31:09.762
We don't know when Mac and
Riley are gonna get there,

31:09.786 --> 31:11.484
and we're talking about
dropping a missile?

31:11.527 --> 31:12.940
How do we even know
that will stop Codex?

31:12.964 --> 31:14.226
The drone

31:14.269 --> 31:16.750
could be our best option at taking out

31:16.793 --> 31:17.751
Codex leadership.

31:17.794 --> 31:19.361
Has everyone lost their minds?

31:19.405 --> 31:21.320
Desi, back me up here.

31:21.363 --> 31:23.167
Sometimes we need to sacrifice
the things we love

31:23.191 --> 31:24.540
for the greater good.

31:24.584 --> 31:26.301
Look, we all know what
you're going through, Bozer.

31:26.325 --> 31:27.674
Angus is family.

31:27.717 --> 31:30.111
But we can't risk billions
of lives to save his.

31:30.155 --> 31:31.983
If you could go back
in time and stop Hitler,

31:32.026 --> 31:34.768
stop 9/11, even if it meant
sacrificing innocent lives,

31:34.811 --> 31:35.812
wouldn't you do it?

31:35.856 --> 31:37.466
Let me I ask you something, Taylor.

31:37.510 --> 31:39.599
How's that so different
than what Codex is saying?

31:41.949 --> 31:43.168
Inform me

31:43.211 --> 31:44.406
when the Reaper's in firing position

31:44.430 --> 31:45.692
and wait for my command.

32:02.361 --> 32:04.276
Home sweet home.

32:11.805 --> 32:13.938
I have eyes on Scarlett,
MacGyver, and another

32:13.981 --> 32:15.417
Phoenix agent. Over.

32:15.461 --> 32:17.091
Scarlett's compromised. Take her out. Take 'em all out.

32:17.115 --> 32:19.595
Hey, Roman, we don't even
know why they're here.

32:19.639 --> 32:20.814
Don't be so naive.

32:20.857 --> 32:22.903
She led Phoenix right to us.

32:27.560 --> 32:30.171
All units,

32:30.215 --> 32:32.521
take out MacGyver. Do not
let them reach the perimeter.

32:35.742 --> 32:38.005
So is there a secret
password or signal?

32:38.049 --> 32:41.356
Or do we just drive up to the
front door and shout "Howdy"?

32:43.706 --> 32:45.360
Duck!

33:04.249 --> 33:06.089
Gwen sure knows how to
roll out the red carpet.

33:06.120 --> 33:08.601
We do tend to be suspicious
of outsiders.

33:16.696 --> 33:17.697
Hang on.

33:23.094 --> 33:25.009
Hold your fire!

33:28.925 --> 33:30.405
That's not good.

33:30.449 --> 33:32.190
They'll have us dead
to rights in a second.

33:33.800 --> 33:35.758
Can you do your Mac thing? Yeah. On it.

33:57.737 --> 33:59.913
Is this really time for arts and crafts?

33:59.956 --> 34:01.132
You know what?
It actually is.

34:13.795 --> 34:15.146
What the hell's

34:15.188 --> 34:16.886
going on down there?

34:16.929 --> 34:19.846
Are they fighting
with Codex agents?

34:26.853 --> 34:29.029
Since you're out of toys,
MacGyver, this one's mine.

34:47.960 --> 34:49.440
Reaper in position.

34:49.484 --> 34:50.485
Target acquired.

34:50.529 --> 34:51.791
There's more going on

34:51.833 --> 34:53.226
down there than we're aware of.

34:53.271 --> 34:56.012
Don't let your trigger finger get itchy.

34:56.056 --> 34:58.406
Come on, Taylor. Mac's fighting them.

35:02.497 --> 35:04.282
Missile One away.

35:04.325 --> 35:05.761
I didn't give the order to fire.

35:05.805 --> 35:08.242
My orders have been
clear all along, sir.

35:08.286 --> 35:10.462
Abort that missile. We've got people on the ground.

35:10.505 --> 35:12.551
I'm afraid I can't do that. I think you can.

35:20.994 --> 35:23.736
MacGyver could provide
valuable intel.

35:23.779 --> 35:25.912
What's the strategic
benefit of shooting him?

35:25.955 --> 35:27.392
Eliminating risk.

35:27.435 --> 35:30.134
I have my orders, and we don't
want to take chances. Hey.

35:30.177 --> 35:32.005
Do not let them near
the ranch house.

35:32.048 --> 35:34.094
Is that clear?
Yes, sir. You heard him.

35:34.138 --> 35:36.290
What now? Well, I just got a lot less
popular at group meals.

35:36.314 --> 35:39.317
We need to make contact with Gwen.

35:41.319 --> 35:42.363
Hey.

35:43.147 --> 35:44.148
Damn.

35:44.191 --> 35:45.279
Taylor pressed the button.

35:45.323 --> 35:46.846
Oh, God. Ella.

35:46.889 --> 35:48.500
We need to get everybody out.

35:48.543 --> 35:50.066
Tell me you got a plan, Mac.

35:50.110 --> 35:51.067
Get to the ranch house.

35:51.111 --> 35:52.199
Of course you'd say that.

36:03.950 --> 36:06.170
Everyone, just calm down.

36:07.606 --> 36:10.870
We're all on the same team here.

36:10.913 --> 36:11.914
Desi?

36:16.528 --> 36:18.269
It's easy.

36:18.312 --> 36:20.096
You can do it, too.

36:30.194 --> 36:31.760
Stand down.

36:34.937 --> 36:36.939
Green light, boys. Fire at will.

36:36.983 --> 36:39.115
Is this windshield bulletproof?

36:39.159 --> 36:41.161
Not against that kind of firepower.

36:41.205 --> 36:44.512
But I have an idea on how
to get through to Gwen.

36:47.559 --> 36:49.474
Wait.

36:50.953 --> 36:52.999
Wait, new orders.
Hold your fire.

36:54.479 --> 36:56.742
Come on, Gwen. He's doing Morse code.

36:57.786 --> 36:59.266
He's saying "Hellfire...

36:59.310 --> 37:01.225
inbound."

37:03.227 --> 37:04.445
Incoming missile.

37:04.489 --> 37:06.621
Emergency protocols. Get everyone to safety now.

37:06.665 --> 37:08.536
Everyone inside! In!

37:08.580 --> 37:10.059
Now! Get the kids. Get 'em in.

37:17.371 --> 37:19.051
Now it's my turn to be
your guardian angel.

37:20.722 --> 37:23.638
He's on our side,
Roman, and so am I.

37:29.470 --> 37:33.082
He brought us Shiva. You gonna shoot him for it?

37:33.126 --> 37:34.997
What's that gonna do
against a Hellfire?

37:35.041 --> 37:37.304
Hopefully it'll act as a
mini missile defense system.

37:37.348 --> 37:38.958
Thank you.

37:47.053 --> 37:48.446
Tesla designed Shiva

37:48.489 --> 37:50.752
to release a powerful
electromagnetic pulse,

37:50.796 --> 37:53.799
which should scramble
any electronics within range.

37:56.018 --> 37:58.238
In this case,
that'd be the guidance system

37:58.282 --> 38:00.284
in an incoming missile.

38:21.566 --> 38:22.741
It actually worked?

38:22.784 --> 38:23.872
Thanks for the doubt.

38:27.049 --> 38:29.878
Hey, Mac, how many missiles does

38:29.922 --> 38:30.792
a Reaper drone carry?

38:30.836 --> 38:32.490
I'm guessing two.

38:39.627 --> 38:41.910
You better hurry. Yeah, well, this thing takes
a minutes to crank.

38:41.934 --> 38:43.936
We don't have a couple minutes.

39:17.186 --> 39:19.406
I'll be hanging onto this.

39:19.450 --> 39:21.408
Thank you, Taylor. You made the right call.

39:21.452 --> 39:23.279
Let me make something
clear to you, Matilda.

39:23.323 --> 39:25.020
I am not on Mac's side.

39:26.457 --> 39:28.937
There's a concrete structure
under that ranch house there.

39:28.981 --> 39:30.156
Taking out Codex leadership

39:30.199 --> 39:31.418
was not 100% guaranteed.

39:31.462 --> 39:32.917
Otherwise, I would have
let that bomb drop,

39:32.941 --> 39:34.943
regardless of Mac or Riley.

39:36.031 --> 39:37.206
Well, then, thank you anyway.

39:37.250 --> 39:38.773
Bozer,

39:38.817 --> 39:40.079
we need to get in touch with Mac

39:40.122 --> 39:41.796
and find out exactly what's
going on down there.

39:41.820 --> 39:43.778
We still don't know
where his loyalties lie,

39:43.822 --> 39:45.737
and our priority is
to take out Codex.

39:45.780 --> 39:47.521
So if he gets in our way next time,

39:47.565 --> 39:50.350
I'm telling you,
I will not hesitate.

39:58.314 --> 39:59.315
Ella.

40:06.801 --> 40:08.716
Thank you.

40:11.632 --> 40:13.329
Roman,

40:13.373 --> 40:14.940
play nice with our guests.

40:22.208 --> 40:24.210
So what changed your mind?

40:26.952 --> 40:29.781
I can't find a hole in
the logic of File 47.

40:29.824 --> 40:32.523
I hate it, but I don't
have any other solutions.

40:33.741 --> 40:35.177
My mother was right.

40:37.005 --> 40:39.443
I'm really glad that you were
here to show me that, Gwen.

40:39.486 --> 40:41.923
So am I.

40:43.751 --> 40:46.145
And your girlfriend?

40:47.189 --> 40:48.626
You know I'm not his girlfriend.

40:48.669 --> 40:50.541
You also know

40:50.584 --> 40:51.759
the skills I have to offer.

40:51.803 --> 40:53.239
We're a package deal.

40:53.282 --> 40:55.459
Then you both understand
the commitment you're making?

40:57.069 --> 40:59.029
Any lingering doubt? We just betrayed our friends

40:59.071 --> 41:01.160
to stop a missile from
dropping on your head,

41:01.203 --> 41:02.901
so I'd say that ship has sailed.

41:06.339 --> 41:08.297
Okay.

41:37.892 --> 41:39.894
Welcome home, Angus.

41:47.293 --> 41:49.121
This is unbelievable.

41:49.164 --> 41:50.484
They built
a whole city down here.

41:54.169 --> 41:56.171
So what now?

41:57.172 --> 41:59.174
Improvise.

42:06.138 --> 42:09.097
