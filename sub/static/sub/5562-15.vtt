¶ ¶

00:23.591 --> 00:25.657
¶ ¶

00:43.677 --> 00:45.544
You can hang
your robe on the rack,

00:45.546 --> 00:47.312
And we'll start with you
face down on the table.

00:47.314 --> 00:49.381
I'll give you a moment
to get comfortable.

01:01.529 --> 01:03.095
I'm sorry,
you have the wrong room...

01:03.097 --> 01:05.197
(zapping, grunting)

01:16.544 --> 01:19.144
What the hell is...

01:37.565 --> 01:39.631
¶ ¶

01:58.619 --> 01:59.818
Callen:
Why would I want to know what

01:59.820 --> 02:02.121
Some guy I've never met
is having for lunch?

02:02.123 --> 02:03.622
I-it makes no sense to me.

02:03.624 --> 02:06.191
Course it doesn't, it's about
the greater collective.

02:06.193 --> 02:08.260
That's why it's
called social media.

02:08.262 --> 02:09.261
You're anti-social.

02:09.263 --> 02:10.462
I am not anti-social.

02:10.464 --> 02:13.132
I'm socially selective.

02:13.134 --> 02:14.133
You're socially challenged.

02:14.135 --> 02:16.268
Because I value my private life?

02:16.270 --> 02:19.304
Because you won't embrace,
for the first time in history,

02:19.306 --> 02:21.306
Our species is
globally connected.

02:21.308 --> 02:24.143
Think of what we could
accomplish as humans worldwide

02:24.145 --> 02:26.612
If we cooperated toward
a common goal.

02:26.614 --> 02:28.881
We could bring back the mcrib
any time we wanted.

02:28.883 --> 02:31.316
Clearly, the evolution
of shared human consciousness

02:31.318 --> 02:32.818
Is lost on some people.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.319
Shared human consciousness?

02:34.321 --> 02:36.388
Teamwork makes
the dream work, baby.

02:39.627 --> 02:42.427
Hey guys, I got something
you'll want to see.

02:42.429 --> 02:44.263
Oh, boy.
(laughs)

02:44.265 --> 02:45.264
Well, I'll tell you

02:45.266 --> 02:46.165
What I don't want to see.

02:46.167 --> 02:48.734
It's you wearing a skirt.

02:48.736 --> 02:49.768
This is a tactical work kilt.

02:49.770 --> 02:50.802
Callen: Yeah, well,

02:50.804 --> 02:51.904
Your work kilt ain't working.

02:51.906 --> 02:53.438
Has hetty seen that?

02:53.440 --> 02:55.307
She has, indeed.

02:55.308 --> 02:57.175
And for your information,
I have received

02:57.178 --> 02:59.178
A plethora of compliments

02:59.180 --> 03:00.646
This morning
on my chosen attire.

03:00.648 --> 03:02.814
Trust me, they were
just being nice.
Hm.

03:02.816 --> 03:03.815
Unlike you two.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.350
(callen whooping)

03:05.352 --> 03:08.353
Mcbeale counter punches.

03:08.355 --> 03:11.290
Boys, don't poke the bear
unless you want...

03:11.292 --> 03:12.891
A bear that's angry.

03:12.893 --> 03:14.660
An angry bear... In a dress.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.428
Now that would make
any bear angry.

03:16.430 --> 03:18.330
Eric:
It's a kilt!

03:20.267 --> 03:22.367
Kensi and deeks are
on their way in,

03:22.369 --> 03:24.436
But I thought you should see.

03:25.439 --> 03:26.905
(sam groans)

03:26.907 --> 03:28.440
I'm hating this already.

03:28.442 --> 03:29.441
Something happen to kirkin?

03:29.443 --> 03:31.543
Sam:
Lucky us.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.478
Looks like he was kidnapped.

03:33.480 --> 03:34.546
By who?

03:34.548 --> 03:35.547
Don't know yet,

03:35.549 --> 03:37.216
But he was grabbed at the spa

03:37.218 --> 03:38.450
Where he does most
of his business.

03:38.452 --> 03:39.451
How did they do that?

03:39.453 --> 03:40.752
He's surrounded by muscle.

03:40.754 --> 03:43.222
Well, today was
no exception, but, uh,

03:43.224 --> 03:44.456
Somebody got through.

03:44.458 --> 03:47.392
They used a stun gun
on the bodyguard

03:47.394 --> 03:49.661
And the massage therapist,
zip-tied and gagged them

03:49.663 --> 03:51.230
In a treatment room.

03:51.232 --> 03:52.764
By the time
they were discovered,

03:52.766 --> 03:54.499
Kirkin was long gone.

03:54.501 --> 03:56.802
How do we know kirkin
didn't fake his own kidnapping

03:56.804 --> 03:58.403
Just to disappear?

03:58.405 --> 03:59.571
Maybe he was just
trying to skip out

03:59.573 --> 04:00.939
On his plea bargain bond.

04:00.941 --> 04:02.007
It's possible.

04:02.009 --> 04:03.575
He was wearing an ankle monitor.

04:03.577 --> 04:04.943
And you tracked it?

04:04.945 --> 04:07.479
Lapd found it duct taped
to the bottom of a mail truck.

04:07.481 --> 04:08.847
That sounds like

04:08.849 --> 04:10.315
A job for the fbi.

04:10.317 --> 04:11.817
Does granger know about this?

04:11.819 --> 04:13.552
Uh, I doubt it.

04:13.553 --> 04:15.286
The assistant director
escorted jennifer kim

04:15.289 --> 04:17.689
On a red-eye
back to washington last night.

04:17.691 --> 04:19.758
(chuckles)
that explains the dress.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.260
No way you'd be brave enough

04:21.262 --> 04:22.861
To wear that thing
with granger around.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.963
Ho-hold on a second,
w-why the sudden interest

04:24.965 --> 04:26.965
In a north korean spy
we picked up two months ago?

04:26.967 --> 04:28.400
No idea.

04:28.402 --> 04:29.801
Maybe he didn't want to see

04:29.803 --> 04:32.671
Someone else's ass
get kicked on the flight.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.339
She did not kick my ass.

04:34.341 --> 04:38.510
Eric has surveillance footage
that says otherwise.

04:38.512 --> 04:40.279
There was...

04:40.281 --> 04:41.446
Surveillance footage of that?

04:42.449 --> 04:43.715
No.

04:45.619 --> 04:46.685
You're funny.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.387
All right,

04:48.389 --> 04:49.855
Let's check this out.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.292
Somebody may be moving
in on kirkin's territory.

04:53.294 --> 04:54.994
So?
So...

04:54.995 --> 04:56.695
We have a working relationship
with kirkin.

04:56.697 --> 04:59.431
The guy sold you out
to a guy called the gargoyle.

04:59.433 --> 05:00.532
Yeah, so he's
the devil we know.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.434
At the very least,
we check it out,

05:02.436 --> 05:03.869
We can rule out that
this is something

05:03.871 --> 05:05.304
We shouldn't be involved with.

05:05.306 --> 05:07.339
Right, right.

05:07.341 --> 05:09.341
Right. Have kensi and deeks
check out the spot,

05:09.343 --> 05:10.475
See if anyone saw anything.

05:10.477 --> 05:12.628
Got it.

05:12.629 --> 05:14.780
Mr. Callen,
a word in my office, please.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.782
(sighs)

05:18.952 --> 05:20.352
No.

05:20.354 --> 05:21.453
No, what?

05:21.455 --> 05:22.587
The answer to your question.

05:22.589 --> 05:23.855
I didn't ask you a question.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.857
You were going to ask me a
question,

05:25.859 --> 05:27.626
And the answer is
an unequivocal no.

05:27.628 --> 05:31.630
So, if you didn't grab him,
might you know who did?

05:31.632 --> 05:32.998
I would have said something
if that were the case.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.966
Kirkin has plenty of enemies,
even more so now

05:34.968 --> 05:38.070
After giving up his prison gang
contacts to avoid jail time.

05:38.072 --> 05:40.539
Hell, I'm surprised it took them
this long to catch him.

05:40.541 --> 05:43.475
Are you surprised
it wasn't an assassination?

05:43.477 --> 05:45.377
Well, I'm sure they want
to question him.

05:45.379 --> 05:47.112
And torture him?

05:48.082 --> 05:50.382
Probably.
Uh-huh.

05:50.384 --> 05:53.618
I assume you were going
to ask my permission

05:53.620 --> 05:55.454
Before looking into this.

05:55.456 --> 05:56.521
Absolutely.

06:01.495 --> 06:03.829
All right, you have until lunch.

06:03.831 --> 06:06.098
Then I want you
and agent hanna

06:06.100 --> 06:08.400
To get back
to your current cases.

06:08.402 --> 06:09.801
Deal.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.436
Uh, no, mr. Callen,

06:11.438 --> 06:13.372
It's not a deal.

06:13.374 --> 06:14.940
It's a directive.

06:25.786 --> 06:28.520
(indistinct tv noises)

06:43.804 --> 06:46.071
You know it's illegal
to smoke in here?

06:59.753 --> 07:00.752
Easy,

07:00.754 --> 07:02.821
Easy, we just want

07:02.823 --> 07:04.489
To ask a few questions.

07:04.491 --> 07:06.792
Everybody, relax.

07:19.773 --> 07:20.972
(screaming)

07:33.520 --> 07:34.986
(groaning)

07:37.458 --> 07:39.591
We got your attention now?

07:49.670 --> 07:51.736
Kirkin's bodyguard came
straight here.

07:51.738 --> 07:53.572
He doesn't remember anything
about the kidnapper,

07:53.574 --> 07:54.739
So we're gonna have to try

07:54.741 --> 07:56.541
And find some usable footage
from the spa.

07:56.543 --> 07:57.542
Eric: Yeah, all right.

07:57.544 --> 07:58.844
I'll see what I can do.

07:58.846 --> 08:00.512
Okay.

08:00.514 --> 08:01.646
What?

08:03.650 --> 08:04.883
Lapd is bringing them
in on weapons charges.

08:04.885 --> 08:06.017
It's a win.

08:06.019 --> 08:08.420
Seriously?

08:08.421 --> 08:10.822
If a guy puts an ak down
in front of me as a threat...

08:10.824 --> 08:13.091
You spit fire at the guy?

08:13.093 --> 08:15.560
Fire? Like a circus act?

08:15.562 --> 08:17.562
I knew you'd follow my lead.

08:18.765 --> 08:21.867
Next time lead by telling me
what the hell your plan is.

08:21.869 --> 08:24.569
I'll do that.

08:24.571 --> 08:26.805
Need some chapstick.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.874
I think I burned my lips.

08:33.647 --> 08:35.514
(grunts)
maybe we should get a treatment

08:35.516 --> 08:37.249
While we're here.
((sighs)

08:37.251 --> 08:38.984
Yeah, I didn't want
to say anything

08:38.986 --> 08:40.452
But you do need a mani/pedi.

08:40.453 --> 08:41.919
Those feet are starting
to look like hobbit feet.

08:41.922 --> 08:43.021
Yeah, I was thinking
more in the lines

08:43.023 --> 08:45.123
Of a nice,
relaxing couple's massage.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.124
I don't get that.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.125
What's not to get?

08:47.127 --> 08:48.927
Me, you, together,
lying naked...

08:48.929 --> 08:50.161
In the presence
of other people...

08:50.163 --> 08:52.163
Yeah, the more the merrier.
No.

08:52.165 --> 08:53.965
When I get a massage
it has to be deep tissue,

08:53.967 --> 08:56.167
And I just want my muscle
knots ground out by force.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.003
I don't want anybody else
in the room for that.

08:58.005 --> 09:00.289
Yeah, god forbid,

09:00.290 --> 09:02.574
Princess hardcore gets
a nice, relaxing shiatsu.

09:02.576 --> 09:04.075
I don't even like
little dogs.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.077
No, shiatsu,
not shih tzu.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.079
Oh my gosh,
I was joking, genius.
(groans)

09:08.081 --> 09:09.681
I know who shiatsu is.

09:09.683 --> 09:10.549
I read<i> the art of war.</i>

09:10.551 --> 09:11.983
No, that's sun tzu.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.218
(laughing):
Oh, my god, again.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.736
I was kidding.

09:14.737 --> 09:16.253
Wow, you are not on
your game today, beach boy.

09:16.256 --> 09:17.589
See? This just proves it.

09:17.591 --> 09:19.558
I need a massage.

09:19.560 --> 09:22.060
I didn't get a good look at her.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.562
Sorry, what? You said her?

09:23.564 --> 09:25.130
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
it was a woman.

09:25.132 --> 09:27.666
She had the hood of her robe up
so I didn't see her face,

09:27.668 --> 09:29.067
But I did get a look
at her legs.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.735
Was she with anybody?

09:30.737 --> 09:31.903
Not that I saw.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.071
Did she say anything?

09:33.073 --> 09:35.073
No.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.491
Was there anything
that you might remember?

09:36.492 --> 09:37.908
Jewelry, tattoo, uh,
the hair color, perhaps?

09:37.911 --> 09:41.246
It happened really fast, sorry.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.014
Nah, it's okay.
Thank you for talking to us,

09:43.016 --> 09:44.683
And if you think
of anything else just, uh,

09:44.685 --> 09:46.084
Go ahead and call me.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.118
Will do.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.970
Thank you.

09:48.971 --> 09:50.821
Uh, maybe I should get
your card, too?

09:50.824 --> 09:52.657
No, no, just my card
will suffice.

09:52.659 --> 09:54.359
Thank you so much, hans.

09:54.361 --> 09:55.627
See you later.

09:55.629 --> 09:57.095
(giggling)

09:57.097 --> 09:58.096
(chuckles wryly)

09:58.098 --> 09:59.998
I still got it.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.967
So, why do you think
they sent a woman?

10:01.969 --> 10:04.202
Why wouldn't they send
a woman, deeks?

10:04.204 --> 10:06.972
Uh, because not
all ladybirds have

10:06.974 --> 10:08.707
Your skill set, my love.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.875
Still pretty sexist,
"my love."

10:10.877 --> 10:12.677
Hmm...
Kirkin always has

10:12.679 --> 10:14.229
A bodyguard with him,
which means

10:14.230 --> 10:15.780
They weren't expecting
a woman to come after him.

10:15.782 --> 10:16.781
That's a good point.

10:16.782 --> 10:17.781
So, how'd she get him
out of here?

10:17.784 --> 10:19.317
Maybe she had help.

10:19.319 --> 10:20.752
But she still had to leave.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.387
True.

10:22.389 --> 10:23.755
(clears throat)

10:23.757 --> 10:24.756
Eric: What's up, kens?

10:24.758 --> 10:25.824
Hey, eric, I know you're already

10:25.826 --> 10:27.058
Reviewing the security footage

10:27.060 --> 10:28.927
From the spa, but we're looking

10:28.929 --> 10:30.829
Specifically for a female.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.197
A ladybird.

10:32.199 --> 10:33.331
Ladybird, copy.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.866
Thanks.

10:34.868 --> 10:37.669
This is surveillance footage
from the spa.

10:37.671 --> 10:38.803
Now, we checked for reflections,

10:38.805 --> 10:40.739
But we never get
a good look at her.

10:41.808 --> 10:44.709
That is some heavy laundry.

10:44.711 --> 10:45.810
Sam:
No driver.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.312
No back-up.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.080
Nell: I get sending in a woman
to be less obvious,

10:49.082 --> 10:51.883
But why was no one waiting there
to whisk her away?

10:51.885 --> 10:53.885
Whoever she is,
she's doing this on her own.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.754
With serious
operational skills.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.288
Which suggests
government training,

10:57.290 --> 10:59.424
But operating
without sanction.

10:59.426 --> 11:00.925
Any more information
on our mystery girl?

11:00.927 --> 11:03.194
Not yet, but we think
she acted alone.

11:03.196 --> 11:04.429
So, maybe it's personal.
Callen:
Yeah, maybe...

11:04.431 --> 11:05.864
Or she's a pro

11:05.866 --> 11:07.799
Hired by any one
of kirkin's enemies.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.834
Puts us right back
where we started.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.336
Hetty: Which would seem
as good a place

11:11.338 --> 11:13.338
As any to end this,

11:13.340 --> 11:15.006
Mr. Callen.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.075
Check your watch.

11:17.077 --> 11:19.811
We know it was a lone female
that grabbed kirkin.

11:20.747 --> 11:22.747
Your time is up.

11:23.984 --> 11:25.717
You want us to just walk away
from this?

11:25.719 --> 11:27.285
No, we'll let
the appropriate authorities

11:27.287 --> 11:30.221
Continue the investigation

11:30.223 --> 11:34.059
So that all of you can
go back to yours.

11:34.061 --> 11:35.360
Eric:
I found her.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.828
Found her. Well, I-I-I didn't,

11:36.830 --> 11:37.996
I didn't find her,

11:37.998 --> 11:38.997
Kaleidoscope found her.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.932
Well, kaleidoscope
didn't find her,

11:40.934 --> 11:43.268
But it found the van that was
used to grab kirkin.

11:43.270 --> 11:44.469
(monitor beeping)

11:44.471 --> 11:46.004
Where is that?

11:46.006 --> 11:47.205
Eric: Long beach.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.007
It's a holding yard
for containers

11:49.009 --> 11:50.075
Bound for the port.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.243
We have to have lunch anyway.

11:52.245 --> 11:54.979
We might as well do it
in long beach.

11:54.981 --> 11:56.715
(sighs)

11:57.451 --> 11:59.184
Make it quick.

11:59.186 --> 12:01.252
And keep your receipts!

12:07.394 --> 12:09.294
¶ ¶

12:28.348 --> 12:30.081
Sam:
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.282
Let me check for wires.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.124
Callen:
Good?

12:47.267 --> 12:49.167
Clear.

12:52.539 --> 12:54.239
Well, now the question is

12:54.241 --> 12:56.040
Did the kidnapper
just dump the van here,

12:56.042 --> 12:57.208
Or was it brought here
for a reason?

12:58.178 --> 13:00.078
Eric, you got eyes
in this area?

13:00.080 --> 13:01.412
Eric:
No, but we should.

13:01.414 --> 13:04.082
The security grid lists
cameras in the area,

13:04.084 --> 13:06.284
But if they're there,
they're offline.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.253
It's very convenient.

13:08.255 --> 13:09.755
Why would you disable cameras

13:09.756 --> 13:11.256
If you're just gonna ditch
a getaway car?

13:11.258 --> 13:12.824
You wouldn't...

13:12.826 --> 13:14.459
Unless you were planning
on coming back.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.261
For the van or something else?

13:16.263 --> 13:17.796
(camera shutter clicks)

13:17.798 --> 13:19.864
Hey, guys, we're
gonna send you

13:19.866 --> 13:21.432
Some bic codes
from these containers.

13:21.434 --> 13:23.234
Find out who owns them
and where they're going.

13:23.236 --> 13:26.004
You got it.

13:26.006 --> 13:27.839
Hey, so, I thought
hetty banned you

13:27.841 --> 13:29.274
From wearing
a kilt to work.

13:29.276 --> 13:32.477
Oh, it was, um,
more like a suspension

13:32.479 --> 13:36.114
Pending my agreement to
work-appropriate undergarments.

13:36.116 --> 13:39.484
So, you weren't wearing
work-appropriate undergarments,

13:39.486 --> 13:43.288
Or you weren't wearing
undergarments at all?

13:46.193 --> 13:47.492
On second thought,
don't answer that.

13:50.831 --> 13:51.896
Ew.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.034
(camera shutters clicking)

13:58.338 --> 14:00.471
(groaning, clattering)

14:02.909 --> 14:04.976
Deeks:
Guys, I got something!

14:21.194 --> 14:22.193
(screaming)

14:22.195 --> 14:23.228
Drop it!

14:23.230 --> 14:26.097
(whimpering):
Ncis?

14:26.099 --> 14:27.532
Oh, you're here

14:27.534 --> 14:29.267
To rescue me.

14:29.269 --> 14:30.869
I don't know what to say.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.170
Do yourself a favor,
don't say anything.

14:32.172 --> 14:34.105
(gulps, groans)

14:34.107 --> 14:36.024
Who put you in here?

14:36.025 --> 14:37.942
The big guy just said
not to say anything.

14:37.944 --> 14:39.244
Just answer the question.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.279
I don't know, sir,
I was drugged.

14:41.281 --> 14:42.614
(engine revving)

14:44.251 --> 14:46.517
Eric, nell, do we have company?

14:46.519 --> 14:48.186
Eric:<i> We're still blind.</i>
Wait, wait.

14:48.188 --> 14:49.354
Hey, what about me?

14:49.356 --> 14:51.456
Marty? Oh, come on.

14:55.095 --> 14:56.394
Don't let him get away!

15:20.487 --> 15:23.388
(panting)

15:36.970 --> 15:38.603
(tires screech)

15:38.604 --> 15:40.237
Federal agents,
get on the ground!

15:40.240 --> 15:41.372
Get down!

15:46.379 --> 15:49.013
(choking)

15:52.319 --> 15:54.953
(gasps)

16:02.062 --> 16:04.062
Anna?

16:14.507 --> 16:18.242
In moscow, you work
out of an elegant walk up,

16:18.244 --> 16:20.578
But in l.A. Your office
is a shack.

16:22.082 --> 16:23.281
It's a shed.

16:23.283 --> 16:24.716
A what?

16:24.718 --> 16:26.150
Boatshed.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.653
A boatshed?
Yeah.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.689
How very l.A.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.724
We use this place
for interrogations.

16:32.726 --> 16:35.059
Am I being interrogated?

16:35.061 --> 16:36.728
Do you need to be?

16:37.697 --> 16:39.731
I've been trying
to located arkady

16:39.733 --> 16:41.733
Ever since you left russia

16:41.735 --> 16:43.368
Without much luck.

16:43.370 --> 16:44.635
Have you found
anything that suggests

16:44.637 --> 16:46.704
Your father survived
his gunshot wounds?

16:46.706 --> 16:48.373
Yes.

16:48.375 --> 16:49.707
Does kirkin know
where arkady is?

16:49.709 --> 16:52.710
No, but the people
that want kirkin...

16:52.712 --> 16:55.013
They can help me.

16:55.015 --> 16:58.216
If you give them kirkin,
what do they promise in return?

16:58.218 --> 17:01.419
Proof that arkady is alive.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.221
I was told he has
a message for me.

17:03.223 --> 17:05.006
I would receive it if

17:05.007 --> 17:06.790
I kidnapped kirkin and put him
in that shipping container

17:06.793 --> 17:08.760
Bound for st. Petersburg.

17:08.762 --> 17:10.762
L.A. To st. Petersburg.

17:10.764 --> 17:14.298
That's 30 days, give or take,
in a steel shipping container.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.767
That is a...

17:15.769 --> 17:18.270
A hellish trip.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.772
Which was appealing to the man
I was bartering with.

17:23.510 --> 17:26.377
I hope kirkin knows how lucky
he is that we found him.

17:29.416 --> 17:32.083
Explain to me again
how ncis ruined your, uh,

17:32.085 --> 17:33.684
What'd you call it, again?

17:33.686 --> 17:36.754
My "me day."

17:36.756 --> 17:38.456
Your "me day?"

17:38.458 --> 17:41.459
It's important to take
time for yourself.

17:41.461 --> 17:42.994
The stresses

17:42.995 --> 17:44.528
Of the modern world...
They're a killer, believe me.

17:44.531 --> 17:47.098
If we, as a human race...

17:47.100 --> 17:48.733
Okay, let's stay on topic,
shall we?

17:48.735 --> 17:50.068
Uh, yes, you're right.

17:50.070 --> 17:52.336
What's important
to remember here

17:52.338 --> 17:54.505
Is that ncis

17:54.507 --> 17:56.808
Drugged and kidnapped me.

17:56.810 --> 17:58.276
(chuckles)
yeah, that didn't happen.

17:58.278 --> 17:59.610
When I saw

17:59.612 --> 18:01.813
Callen speaking
to that angry minx,

18:01.815 --> 18:04.115
I recognized her from the spa.

18:04.117 --> 18:06.784
She was part of the elite crew
that snatched me up.

18:06.786 --> 18:11.122
If, by elite crew, you mean
a single, solitary, 120 pound...

18:11.124 --> 18:12.857
115 pound, actually.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.525
I don't know,
she's pretty tall.

18:14.527 --> 18:15.827
I know,
but she's pretty athletic.

18:15.829 --> 18:17.728
W-w-w-w-wait, you're saying

18:17.730 --> 18:18.796
That girl...

18:18.798 --> 18:19.764
That woman.

18:19.766 --> 18:23.101
Excuse me, that woman...

18:23.103 --> 18:26.704
No, no, she could not
breach my security

18:26.706 --> 18:28.206
And kidnap me on her own.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.273
This didn't happen.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.342
Yeah, actually it did.

18:31.344 --> 18:32.343
She breached.

18:32.345 --> 18:33.578
She kidnapped.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.914
She bought the t-shirt.

18:35.915 --> 18:38.249
I'm sorry, does that violate
your sense of self?

18:38.251 --> 18:41.586
This playful arrogance
of yours, marty,

18:41.588 --> 18:43.154
It really works for you.

18:43.156 --> 18:44.489
You got it.

18:44.491 --> 18:46.424
On every level, you got it.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.427
(sighs) my "me day"

18:49.429 --> 18:51.329
Is beginning to look up.

18:51.331 --> 18:52.697
(chuckles)

18:52.699 --> 18:54.899
Dear god.

18:54.901 --> 18:57.768
Okay, I've placed photos
of kirkin in a secure file

18:57.770 --> 18:59.570
Just as anna
was instructed to do.

18:59.572 --> 19:00.771
Thanks, nell.

19:00.773 --> 19:02.573
No problem.

19:02.575 --> 19:03.841
What do we do now?

19:03.843 --> 19:05.610
Wait for your friends
in russia to respond.

19:05.612 --> 19:06.777
We wait.

19:06.779 --> 19:09.630
You go outside.

19:09.631 --> 19:12.482
Someone would like
to have a word with you.

19:30.436 --> 19:33.337
Anastasia kolchek.

19:33.339 --> 19:35.540
Henrietta lange.

19:35.542 --> 19:36.941
Have you been having issues

19:36.943 --> 19:38.876
With your cell phone connection

19:38.878 --> 19:41.946
Or your e-mail access?

19:41.948 --> 19:44.949
I've been busy.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.951
Ah.

19:50.623 --> 19:51.856
Did you ever stop to think

19:51.858 --> 19:53.424
That I was trying
to contact you

19:53.426 --> 19:56.561
To offer my assistance
in finding arkady?

19:56.563 --> 19:57.628
Were you?

19:59.966 --> 20:01.899
No, I wasn't.

20:01.901 --> 20:03.968
(chuckles)

20:05.438 --> 20:07.672
So why did you call?

20:07.674 --> 20:11.709
I called because there was

20:11.711 --> 20:14.645
An assignment
that you were right for.

20:15.982 --> 20:17.882
An assignment that paid money?

20:17.884 --> 20:19.217
Oh, yes.

20:19.219 --> 20:21.285
Who would I be working for?

20:21.287 --> 20:23.387
Me, of course.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.756
Of course. (chuckles)

20:26.693 --> 20:27.892
After you find

20:27.894 --> 20:29.260
Your father,

20:29.262 --> 20:30.928
We can discuss the assignment.

20:31.898 --> 20:35.299
It would be
a good move for you.

20:35.301 --> 20:37.868
Well, I don't know
about an assignment,

20:37.870 --> 20:40.905
But I should have
returned your call.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.807
That would have
been courteous,

20:42.809 --> 20:46.644
But not reaching out to me
when you were first in l.A...

20:46.646 --> 20:48.946
That was just dumb.

20:51.284 --> 20:53.017
I know.

20:53.019 --> 20:56.354
We have similar goals.

20:56.356 --> 20:58.422
A trust.

20:58.424 --> 20:59.690
Why go it alone?

21:01.628 --> 21:04.262
Alone works.

21:04.264 --> 21:06.030
It can.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.933
Alone is safe.

21:08.935 --> 21:11.736
A team's safer.

21:12.672 --> 21:14.772
But I don't have a team.

21:14.774 --> 21:17.041
(laughs)

21:17.043 --> 21:18.976
What?

21:18.978 --> 21:21.479
Well, ten years ago,

21:21.481 --> 21:24.048
I had this same conversation

21:24.050 --> 21:26.017
With someone.

21:26.019 --> 21:27.451
And how did that go?

21:27.453 --> 21:29.520
Well, it's still going.

21:29.522 --> 21:32.056
(laughs)

21:32.058 --> 21:35.926
Not having anyone
to depend on.

21:35.928 --> 21:38.829
Depending on no one.

21:40.767 --> 21:43.934
That's no way
of living life.

21:49.842 --> 21:51.909
'55 550 spyder.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.846
You know your cars.

21:55.848 --> 21:57.882
I know porsches.

21:59.018 --> 22:01.585
This is the same model
james dean was driving.

22:01.587 --> 22:05.323
A beautiful car
for a beautiful man.

22:05.325 --> 22:07.658
It's a stunning replica.

22:12.332 --> 22:14.398
Yes, it is.

22:15.568 --> 22:18.002
If we never cross paths
with kirkin again,

22:18.004 --> 22:19.970
It's gonna be too soon
in my book.

22:19.972 --> 22:20.971
What's wrong?

22:20.973 --> 22:22.673
A little lover's quarrel?

22:22.675 --> 22:24.075
Mm...
Did kirkin rub you
the wrong way?

22:24.077 --> 22:25.076
(sam laughs)

22:25.078 --> 22:26.344
Nice.

22:26.346 --> 22:27.912
Kirkin finds me attractive.

22:27.914 --> 22:29.347
Don't be jealous.

22:29.349 --> 22:30.014
Oh, yeah, that's it.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.682
Jealous.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.451
Listen, no one is immune
to the deeks-ness,

22:33.453 --> 22:34.785
Man or woman.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.254
It's a curse, really.
I've had to deal with it

22:36.255 --> 22:37.722
My whole entire life.
I think it's my kind

22:37.724 --> 22:39.123
And soulful blue eyes.
Wow.

22:39.125 --> 22:40.691
Anna:
Yeah...

22:40.693 --> 22:42.793
It's a burden you
must live with.
Yeah.

22:42.795 --> 22:44.528
Thank you.
See? Anna gets it.

22:44.530 --> 22:45.596
Don't encourage him.

22:45.598 --> 22:46.964
Or look into his kind

22:46.966 --> 22:48.699
And soulful blue eyes.

22:48.701 --> 22:51.135
Out of respect for kensi,
I will keep my distance

22:51.137 --> 22:52.370
From the deeks-ness.

22:52.372 --> 22:53.371
Both:
Thank you.

22:53.373 --> 22:55.139
Guys, it worked.

22:55.141 --> 22:58.809
We just received
a secure video message for anna.

22:59.746 --> 23:02.046
Anna, if you are seeing this,

23:02.048 --> 23:05.015
Then you did what was
asked of you.

23:05.017 --> 23:06.150
Thank you.

23:06.152 --> 23:08.419
My superior

23:08.421 --> 23:11.589
Mental toughness has allowed me
to survive this far,

23:11.591 --> 23:15.059
But I am hopeful that
I will be leaving soon

23:15.061 --> 23:17.061
With my...

23:17.063 --> 23:19.563
New comrade, balinski.

23:19.565 --> 23:21.031
I've learned little
about this man,

23:21.033 --> 23:22.967
But I believe he worked

23:22.969 --> 23:25.469
For a time in sevastapol

23:25.471 --> 23:27.972
(sighs) with my good friend, g.

23:27.974 --> 23:31.142
I ask nothing
more of you, anna.

23:31.144 --> 23:32.810
You owe me nothing.

23:32.812 --> 23:33.811
(footsteps)
and for...

23:33.813 --> 23:35.413
(man speaking russian)

23:35.415 --> 23:36.480
And that's all we have.

23:38.418 --> 23:40.751
Arkady's alive.

23:40.753 --> 23:42.486
Nell, any other information
embedded in that file?

23:42.488 --> 23:44.488
We just started combing
through the metadata,

23:44.490 --> 23:46.891
But we know the video
was shot two days ago.

23:49.128 --> 23:51.128
I need to get
him out of there.

23:54.066 --> 23:56.033
I'll help you.

24:19.225 --> 24:20.558
Arkady mentioned you worked

24:20.560 --> 24:22.993
With that prisoner
in sevastapol.

24:22.995 --> 24:24.962
You know him?

24:24.964 --> 24:26.931
No.

24:26.933 --> 24:29.834
But I did work in sevastapol
when I was with the agency.

24:32.004 --> 24:34.171
Think this guy's cia?

24:34.173 --> 24:36.640
Probably.

24:36.642 --> 24:37.775
How else would he know
where I worked?

24:37.777 --> 24:40.744
Arkady didn't know
I was in sevastapol.

24:40.746 --> 24:42.213
You sure?

24:47.954 --> 24:49.520
Thank you.

24:49.522 --> 24:51.956
For what?

24:51.958 --> 24:52.957
For not coming out here

24:52.959 --> 24:54.442
And telling me that

24:54.443 --> 24:55.926
I shouldn't be helping
anna rescue arkady.

24:55.928 --> 24:58.762
I got to be honest, g.

24:58.764 --> 25:01.699
What I'm saying
and what I'm feeling...

25:01.701 --> 25:03.767
They're at odds.

25:03.769 --> 25:05.836
But I get it.

25:07.707 --> 25:09.006
Arkady's a link
to you finding out

25:09.008 --> 25:12.176
What kind of man
your father was.

25:12.178 --> 25:14.044
Your history.

25:14.046 --> 25:15.779
Look, I have to do this.

25:15.781 --> 25:18.282
You don't.

25:18.284 --> 25:19.884
I know.

25:23.890 --> 25:25.055
But that's what we do.

25:29.295 --> 25:33.030
How should I know
what russian prison

25:33.032 --> 25:34.899
They're holding
arkady kolchek in?

25:34.901 --> 25:36.967
Okay, listen, you help us,
you get to leave.

25:36.969 --> 25:38.002
It's that simple.

25:38.004 --> 25:39.003
Or what?

25:39.005 --> 25:40.905
You hold me here forever?

25:40.907 --> 25:41.906
Nope.

25:41.908 --> 25:42.973
Just 30 days.

25:42.975 --> 25:46.010
What are you talking
about 30 days?

25:46.012 --> 25:46.944
You're a missing person.

25:46.946 --> 25:48.312
Nobody knows where you are.

25:48.313 --> 25:49.679
The only people who think
they know where you are,

25:49.682 --> 25:51.048
Think that you're
in a shipping container

25:51.050 --> 25:52.716
Some place in the pacific.

25:52.718 --> 25:54.318
And what happens
in 30 days when they

25:54.320 --> 25:56.086
Open said shipping container
that you should be in?

25:56.088 --> 25:57.888
You know, the one we just
rescued you from.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.890
Which, by the way, you've never
thanked us for, actually.

25:59.892 --> 26:01.725
What happens is

26:01.727 --> 26:03.294
They're gonna search for you.

26:03.296 --> 26:05.029
And then they find you.

26:05.031 --> 26:06.297
And then they kill you.

26:07.800 --> 26:10.200
You are more fun in bath houses.

26:10.202 --> 26:11.902
Yeah, I keep hearing that.

26:11.904 --> 26:13.604
We need to know
where arkady is being held,

26:13.606 --> 26:14.805
And we need to know
the name of the people

26:14.807 --> 26:15.906
On that cell block.

26:15.908 --> 26:17.274
How do we find that out?

26:17.276 --> 26:20.844
If I tell you how to do this,
I can go?

26:20.846 --> 26:24.782
Disappear before that ship
ever makes it to russia?

26:24.784 --> 26:25.983
I don't know, deeks,
are you gonna be okay

26:25.985 --> 26:27.117
If kirkin disappears for awhile?

26:27.119 --> 26:28.953
I mean,
I can try to be strong.

26:28.955 --> 26:30.121
And power through it?

26:30.122 --> 26:31.288
Probably gonna cry
myself to sleep.

26:31.290 --> 26:33.023
Kirkin:
(sighs) okay.

26:33.025 --> 26:34.858
Um...

26:34.860 --> 26:38.896
The only way to do
this is to access fsin.

26:38.898 --> 26:40.698
The russian prison system?

26:40.700 --> 26:44.969
Yes. Uh, but the section
of the fsin system

26:44.971 --> 26:46.971
Where you can find
this information

26:46.973 --> 26:48.906
Cannot be accessed remotely.

26:48.908 --> 26:52.109
So we need a direct connection
from a secure terminal.

26:52.111 --> 26:53.877
Mm-hmm.

26:53.879 --> 26:56.080
But you are in luck.

26:56.082 --> 27:00.017
There's one right here
in your golden state.

27:00.019 --> 27:01.285
Where?

27:02.321 --> 27:04.855
The russian consul general,
of course.

27:08.628 --> 27:11.629
The russian consul
general's computer.

27:11.631 --> 27:13.364
Sounds like an easy guy
to get close to.

27:13.366 --> 27:14.765
Yeah...

27:14.767 --> 27:16.700
I'm sure he loans out
his secured computer

27:16.702 --> 27:19.336
To strangers all the time.

27:22.008 --> 27:23.841
Think kirkin's
telling the truth?

27:23.843 --> 27:26.910
About needing a direct link
to access the fsin system?

27:26.912 --> 27:28.245
I mean, it makes sense.

27:28.247 --> 27:29.813
But what if he's lying?

27:29.815 --> 27:31.782
Well, we won't know that
until we can get someone

27:31.784 --> 27:33.117
In front of the
consul general's computer.

27:33.119 --> 27:35.819
Hmm, a federal agent...

27:35.821 --> 27:37.921
Caught accessing
a secure network

27:37.923 --> 27:39.223
In the russian consulate.

27:39.225 --> 27:40.924
Yeah, that doesn't sound
like a disaster at all.

27:40.926 --> 27:42.509
Yeah, especially given

27:42.510 --> 27:44.093
Our strained diplomatic
relations at the moment.

27:46.032 --> 27:47.998
Can you believe
anna came to l.A.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.833
And didn't ask us for help?

27:49.835 --> 27:51.101
Some people can't
ask for help.

27:51.103 --> 27:52.102
They don't know how.

27:52.104 --> 27:53.137
Ah, not me.

27:53.139 --> 27:54.371
I'm good with help.

27:54.373 --> 27:55.773
(sighs)
it's one way

27:55.775 --> 27:57.808
Anna and I are different.

27:57.810 --> 27:59.109
One way?

27:59.111 --> 28:01.445
Yeah, we're simpatico,
cut from the same cloth,

28:01.447 --> 28:03.747
Kind of in that misunderstood,

28:03.749 --> 28:05.349
Loner kind of way.

28:05.351 --> 28:07.918
(laughs)
sorry, loner?

28:07.920 --> 28:09.286
Yeah, I live alone.

28:09.288 --> 28:10.387
You're a member
of three different

28:10.389 --> 28:12.022
Live action
role-play groups.

28:12.024 --> 28:13.357
So, I'm down
with larping.

28:13.359 --> 28:15.025
And a dungeons
and dragons group.

28:15.027 --> 28:17.327
And a magic:
The gathering group.
Please,

28:17.329 --> 28:19.096
Those guys are more
like family at this point.

28:19.098 --> 28:20.614
Beale, you are
one of the most

28:20.615 --> 28:22.131
Socially scheduled
people I know.

28:22.134 --> 28:25.135
Hey, I keep sundays
free and clear...

28:25.137 --> 28:26.837
When they cancel trivia.

28:26.839 --> 28:28.138
Exactly.

28:28.140 --> 28:30.007
Point is, you and anna,
nothing alike.

28:30.009 --> 28:31.475
Oh, here's something.

28:31.477 --> 28:32.710
Okay, fine.

28:32.712 --> 28:34.178
You're both blonde.
No, no,

28:34.180 --> 28:35.879
No, check this out.

28:35.881 --> 28:37.481
What's up?
(clears throat)
normally,

28:37.483 --> 28:39.233
The consul general is

28:39.234 --> 28:40.984
In san francisco,
but for the past month

28:40.986 --> 28:42.720
He's been operating
out of l.A.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.455
Hopefully not that consulate
property in hancock park

28:44.457 --> 28:46.190
Callen and sam shot up?
No,

28:46.192 --> 28:48.425
It's an estate
in palos verdes.

28:48.427 --> 28:49.960
Question is...

28:49.962 --> 28:52.062
What has he been doing
in l.A. For the past month?

28:52.064 --> 28:54.164
Probably planning
this charity gala.

28:54.166 --> 28:55.733
It's tonight.

28:55.735 --> 28:57.167
It starts in an hour.

28:57.169 --> 28:59.103
Of course, it does.

28:59.105 --> 29:00.404
(sighs)
okay, well,

29:00.406 --> 29:02.106
We'll need to backstop
undercover identities

29:02.108 --> 29:03.307
For the entire team

29:03.309 --> 29:06.110
That will hold water
with the russian fsb.

29:06.112 --> 29:08.178
And add them all
to the guest list.

29:08.180 --> 29:10.047
Is that even possible
to do in an hour?

29:10.049 --> 29:11.448
For mere mortals, not a chance.

29:11.450 --> 29:13.317
For the beale, hells yeah.

29:13.319 --> 29:15.119
All right, great.

29:15.121 --> 29:17.121
Tell him what he's won, deeks.

29:17.123 --> 29:20.090
Anatoli kirkin, you've won
a 30 day head start

29:20.092 --> 29:22.192
From the russian mob.

29:22.194 --> 29:25.195
I'm always happy to be
of assistance, colleagues.

29:25.197 --> 29:28.532
Marty, when I get set up,
I will send for you.

29:28.534 --> 29:30.501
Well, that sounds promising.

29:30.503 --> 29:32.870
And pay no attention
to the critics.

29:32.872 --> 29:35.172
Your hairstyle is glorious.

29:35.174 --> 29:37.241
Driver.

29:37.243 --> 29:39.209
Means the world,
coming from you.

29:40.212 --> 29:42.212
He's gonna send for you.

29:42.214 --> 29:43.447
You better keep
your bags packed.

29:43.449 --> 29:44.815
Wow, anybody else?

29:44.817 --> 29:46.450
You got
something for me?
Oh, well...

29:46.452 --> 29:49.086
It is, uh...

29:49.088 --> 29:51.121
Glorious.

29:51.123 --> 29:53.223
Isn't it?
Oh, oh,
it's something.

29:53.225 --> 29:54.224
Mm-hmm.

29:54.226 --> 29:55.559
Hetty:
Right here.

29:56.529 --> 29:58.862
Thank you.

29:58.864 --> 30:02.166
You all look
woefully underdressed.

30:02.168 --> 30:04.101
We are if we're going
to a charity gala

30:04.103 --> 30:06.136
At the russian
consul general's.

30:06.138 --> 30:08.172
Were eric and nell able
to set up our covers?

30:08.174 --> 30:09.173
They were, indeed.

30:09.175 --> 30:10.374
Anna will be joining you.

30:10.376 --> 30:11.942
Having a russian along with you

30:11.944 --> 30:14.211
Should prove helpful.

30:14.213 --> 30:16.180
What identities
were backstopped?

30:16.182 --> 30:19.183
Anna is a russian billionaire
heiress slash aspiring pop star.

30:19.185 --> 30:21.018
Deeks:
Great.

30:21.019 --> 30:22.852
So, I go in as her
billionaire husband, then?

30:22.855 --> 30:24.087
Uh, well, actually,

30:24.089 --> 30:26.423
Mr. Callen will be playing
anna's boyfriend.

30:26.425 --> 30:28.091
Very nice.

30:28.093 --> 30:29.159
Deeks:
All right, so,

30:29.160 --> 30:30.226
A and r executives
to the stars,

30:30.229 --> 30:31.328
'cause I can rock that.

30:31.330 --> 30:34.264
No, sam will enter

30:34.266 --> 30:36.200
As the ceo of anna's

30:36.202 --> 30:38.101
Growing media empire.

30:38.103 --> 30:39.970
I picked that out myself.

30:39.972 --> 30:43.207
Hetty, your styling skills
get better with time

30:43.209 --> 30:45.108
Like fine wine,
you know that?

30:45.110 --> 30:46.109
All right,

30:46.111 --> 30:49.246
Now listen, get out of here.

30:49.248 --> 30:51.315
You need to be at the gala
in 30 minutes.

30:51.317 --> 30:53.951
Uh, so just quickly,
no more garment bags?

30:53.953 --> 30:55.152
Actually, no.

30:55.154 --> 30:56.520
Oh, I get it.
My tux is custom

30:56.522 --> 30:58.222
Because of my long arms
and broad shoulders.

30:58.224 --> 30:59.223
It's a struggle.

30:59.225 --> 31:00.157
A daily struggle.

31:00.159 --> 31:01.358
A curse, if you will.
Stop.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.359
(whispering):
Stop.

31:02.361 --> 31:04.261
Hetty:
You will find

31:04.262 --> 31:06.162
Your uniforms
when you collect the van.

31:06.165 --> 31:07.965
Uni-what?
What's our cover?

31:07.967 --> 31:09.533
Staff for the catering.

31:10.502 --> 31:12.135
So, no tux then.

31:12.137 --> 31:14.471
No tux, mr. Deeks.

31:14.473 --> 31:16.206
So, cater-waiter, then?

31:16.208 --> 31:17.207
Yes, right.

31:17.209 --> 31:18.976
Maybe a bow tie?

31:18.978 --> 31:20.611
Can I at least
have a bow tie?

31:27.253 --> 31:29.486
You were supposed to be
here 30 minutes ago.

31:29.488 --> 31:31.521
Uh, I'm so sorry.
We got lost.

31:32.491 --> 31:34.157
Unbelievable.

31:35.160 --> 31:36.360
Whoa.

31:37.296 --> 31:39.062
(indistinct conversation)

31:39.064 --> 31:41.198
Put it on the end counter.
Okay.

31:41.200 --> 31:42.499
Oh, there's
a really unique smell

31:42.501 --> 31:43.500
Coming off
of this thing.

31:43.502 --> 31:44.568
It's coulibiac.

31:44.570 --> 31:45.969
That's not helping me.

31:45.971 --> 31:48.071
Sturgeon, egg,
rice, and mushrooms

31:48.073 --> 31:49.690
Baked into
a loaf of bread.

31:49.691 --> 31:51.308
Oh, I think I just threw up
a little bit in my mouth.

31:51.310 --> 31:53.076
Yeah, just hold it
together, martina.

31:53.078 --> 31:55.145
God.

32:18.671 --> 32:19.703
Callen:
Eric, nell,

32:19.705 --> 32:21.939
You guys copy?

32:21.941 --> 32:23.040
Nell:
Oh, we got you.

32:23.042 --> 32:24.474
Your covers have
been uploaded

32:24.476 --> 32:26.109
And your names are
on the guest list.

32:26.111 --> 32:29.079
G, you tracking this?

32:29.081 --> 32:33.150
(camera shutter clicking)

32:33.152 --> 32:35.218
Guys, we got a problem.

32:35.220 --> 32:37.421
They're using
facial rec to verify I.D.

32:37.423 --> 32:40.123
(sighs)
copy that.

32:41.427 --> 32:42.592
We don't have it.

32:42.594 --> 32:44.127
We're next.

32:44.129 --> 32:46.697
I'll buy you some time
with a signal jammer.

32:46.699 --> 32:48.498
Coming to you now.

32:48.500 --> 32:49.499
What are you doing?

32:49.501 --> 32:50.500
W-w-wait, no, no,

32:50.502 --> 32:51.601
I-I don't-I don't
feel so good.

32:51.603 --> 32:53.078
Please,
get out of my way.

32:53.079 --> 32:54.554
You know, I'm doing this
for you, 'cause I tried

32:54.555 --> 32:56.030
Some of the sturgeon bread
and then I just...

32:56.031 --> 32:57.506
Oh, my god, it was like
a gey-I threw up in the pantry.

32:57.509 --> 32:59.309
Shh! Keep your voice down.

33:07.653 --> 33:09.720
(speaking russian)

33:11.423 --> 33:12.756
Yes, I'm everett.

33:12.758 --> 33:15.025
(speaking russian)

33:18.497 --> 33:21.665
I see that you have lived
in london and new york.

33:21.667 --> 33:24.201
Yes. Your english is superb.

33:24.203 --> 33:25.435
Thank you.

33:25.437 --> 33:30.273
I'm sorry, but we have
many security protocols.

33:30.275 --> 33:31.241
Hold on,

33:31.243 --> 33:32.609
These photos aren't

33:32.611 --> 33:34.111
Gonna turn up on tmz
or anything like that?

33:34.113 --> 33:35.379
No, sir.

33:37.182 --> 33:40.450
Oh, I thought you boys
might be hungry.

33:40.452 --> 33:41.685
I need you to leave

33:41.687 --> 33:43.253
The security area now.

33:43.255 --> 33:44.254
Eric: Keep stalling,
I need more time.

33:44.256 --> 33:45.789
And you?
I-I'm very sorry.

33:45.791 --> 33:47.557
She must have gotten lost.
Let's go.

33:47.559 --> 33:49.526
Oh, but these people
might be hungry.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.328
Perhaps I can interest
you in some endives

33:51.330 --> 33:53.063
With some chopped tomatoes.

33:53.065 --> 33:55.766
Yeah, why not?

33:55.768 --> 33:57.167
Beale?

33:57.169 --> 33:58.035
Uploading now...

33:58.037 --> 33:59.369
Done.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.138
Facial rec is in place.

34:01.140 --> 34:03.106
We have to go.
Okay.

34:03.108 --> 34:04.174
Have a lovely evening.
Pardon me.

34:04.176 --> 34:05.175
(whispering):
Sorry.

34:05.177 --> 34:06.743
We good here?

34:08.814 --> 34:11.048
(beeping)

34:12.184 --> 34:13.683
Please, enjoy the gala.

34:13.685 --> 34:15.352
Thank you.
(speaks russian)

34:20.325 --> 34:22.759
(sighs)

34:33.439 --> 34:35.305
Leaving the server room now.

34:35.307 --> 34:36.373
Eric:
Copy that, deeks.

34:37.076 --> 34:38.442
All right, we're in.

34:38.444 --> 34:39.643
And we have live feed

34:39.645 --> 34:41.278
From the consulate
surveillance system.

34:41.280 --> 34:43.346
¶ ¶

34:45.217 --> 34:48.251
You must, must, must come
to burn 60 with us

34:48.253 --> 34:49.352
While you're here in l.A.

34:49.354 --> 34:52.089
It is a fabulous workout.

34:52.091 --> 34:55.125
That sounds wonderful,
but while I'm in l.A.,

34:55.127 --> 34:56.426
My focus is on cal

34:56.428 --> 34:58.195
And my music.

34:58.197 --> 35:00.330
Oh, you're so sweet.

35:00.332 --> 35:02.299
How about you, sam?

35:02.301 --> 35:04.468
I'm sure getting sweaty

35:04.470 --> 35:07.537
With you is a time
to remember.

35:07.539 --> 35:09.206
You better believe it.

35:09.208 --> 35:10.207
(giggles)

35:10.209 --> 35:11.308
You're delicious.

35:11.310 --> 35:12.275
(chuckles)

35:12.277 --> 35:13.710
Okay, selfie time.

35:13.712 --> 35:15.212
Not before I have a dance

35:15.214 --> 35:16.179
With my girl.

35:16.181 --> 35:17.748
Sam:
Oh, you know what,

35:17.749 --> 35:19.316
I think I see a friend of mine
over there from samara.

35:19.318 --> 35:21.852
Oh, okay, well,
you hurry back.

35:21.854 --> 35:23.487
Okay.
Oh.

35:23.489 --> 35:24.554
(giggles)

35:24.556 --> 35:26.623
(singsongy):
Bye...

35:32.531 --> 35:34.297
You've done this before.

35:36.235 --> 35:38.335
So have you.

35:39.505 --> 35:42.806
Well, I worked as a janitor at
a country club when I was a kid.

35:42.808 --> 35:43.507
Just kind of picked it up.

35:47.913 --> 35:51.181
Ballroom dancing via osmosis.

35:51.183 --> 35:53.850
Impressive.

35:53.852 --> 35:56.486
You haven't seen
anything yet.

35:58.423 --> 36:01.558
Okay, guys, we've located the
computer with the direct link

36:01.560 --> 36:02.726
To fsin.

36:02.728 --> 36:04.928
It's upstairs in the southeast

36:04.930 --> 36:06.547
Corner bedroom.

36:06.548 --> 36:08.165
Now, the only problem is
we've got two security guards

36:08.167 --> 36:09.666
Posted at the door.

36:09.668 --> 36:11.301
Deeks: Kensi and I will take
care of security.

36:11.303 --> 36:12.435
Okay.

36:12.437 --> 36:14.471
Nell:
Kensi, one of the guards

36:14.473 --> 36:16.239
From the front entrance
is moving towards you.

36:18.177 --> 36:19.209
Deeks: He may have
figured out you had

36:19.211 --> 36:20.677
A signal scrambler.

36:20.679 --> 36:22.279
Callen: Kensi and deeks,
go deal with him.

36:22.281 --> 36:25.282
Anna and I will handle
the guards upstairs.

36:25.284 --> 36:27.350
I'm moving to the room
where the guards are going.

36:42.935 --> 36:44.935
What are you doing up here?

36:44.937 --> 36:47.237
I was just looking for candles.

36:47.239 --> 36:49.206
I need to search you.

36:52.611 --> 36:55.245
(yelling)

36:55.247 --> 36:56.213
You got this?

36:56.215 --> 36:57.347
Yeah, no, I definitely got him.

36:57.349 --> 36:57.981
Mmm.

36:57.983 --> 37:00.450
(grunting)

37:00.452 --> 37:02.252
Okay, for a second
I thought you didn't have him.

37:02.254 --> 37:03.653
No, no, I got him.
I told you I got him.

37:03.655 --> 37:04.821
(grunting):
Oh, my gosh.

37:04.823 --> 37:06.289
(grunting):
Like a russian bear.

37:06.291 --> 37:07.290
Guard secured.

37:07.292 --> 37:08.592
How do you want to play this?

37:08.594 --> 37:09.826
I've got a plan.

37:09.828 --> 37:10.994
Ah, that sounds good.

37:10.996 --> 37:11.995
What's the play?

37:11.997 --> 37:14.664
Just follow my lead.

37:14.666 --> 37:15.966
Just follow your lead?

37:15.968 --> 37:17.334
Yes.

37:17.336 --> 37:20.503
Just do what comes naturally.

37:26.311 --> 37:29.279
Excuse me, no one
is allowed up here.

37:29.281 --> 37:31.848
You need to go
back downstairs.

37:34.386 --> 37:36.386
Sir.

37:36.388 --> 37:37.554
Ma'am,
(moans)

37:37.556 --> 37:38.788
You need to go
back downstairs

37:38.790 --> 37:40.991
To gala immediately.

37:43.562 --> 37:45.428
Sam:
G, I'm in.

37:52.804 --> 37:54.371
Um,

37:54.373 --> 37:55.805
Yes, um,

37:55.807 --> 37:57.307
I'm sorry.
She got a little, uh...

37:58.777 --> 38:01.311
We'll go back... Downstairs.

38:14.860 --> 38:17.961
All right, usb drive
is in place.

38:17.963 --> 38:20.764
Eric: Good. All right, I can
disable the system password

38:20.766 --> 38:23.533
And connect you
to the fsin system, but, sam,

38:23.535 --> 38:26.436
From that terminal
you'll need to find and download

38:26.438 --> 38:28.305
The prisoner transportation log

38:28.307 --> 38:29.673
And the prisoner I.D. Log.

38:29.675 --> 38:30.974
Got it.

38:40.485 --> 38:41.518
Found it.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.086
Downloading now.

38:44.456 --> 38:45.855
Nell, what's my exfil?

38:45.857 --> 38:47.924
(sighs)
not the way you came in.

38:47.926 --> 38:49.492
The guards are back at the door.

38:52.631 --> 38:54.464
Download complete.

38:57.002 --> 38:58.501
Nell: Deeks, are you and kensie
in the van?

38:58.503 --> 38:59.502
Deeks:
Yeah.

38:59.504 --> 39:00.970
We're here.

39:00.972 --> 39:03.073
Kensi:
We got eyes on callen and anna.

39:08.113 --> 39:09.079
Come on, sam.

39:09.081 --> 39:10.597
Nell, talk to me.

39:10.598 --> 39:12.114
I'm with you, sam.
There should be a door

39:12.117 --> 39:13.383
On your left.

39:13.385 --> 39:14.417
There is.

39:14.419 --> 39:16.019
Good. It leads to a balcony,

39:16.021 --> 39:18.455
But from here you're gonna
be on your own.

39:18.457 --> 39:20.457
Good luck.

39:20.459 --> 39:21.524
Yeah.

39:50.389 --> 39:51.421
Kensi:
Let's go.

39:51.423 --> 39:53.123
(door closes)

39:53.125 --> 39:55.158
Deeks, let's roll.
Moving out.

39:57.562 --> 39:59.462
Nice assist on the signal jam
in there, kens.

39:59.464 --> 40:01.097
Any time.

40:01.098 --> 40:02.731
How'd you get the guards
away from the door?

40:03.702 --> 40:05.568
I had a plan.

40:05.570 --> 40:07.070
She had a plan.

40:09.841 --> 40:11.508
(sirens wail)

40:14.446 --> 40:15.478
What does this mean?

40:15.480 --> 40:17.147
This means
you were correct.

40:17.149 --> 40:19.416
The man being held
with arkady is cia.

40:19.418 --> 40:21.084
Yes, the man arkady

40:21.086 --> 40:23.420
Knows as balinski

40:23.422 --> 40:27.457
Is actually
cia officer randall sharov.

40:27.459 --> 40:30.160
He was believed dead
until this video surfaced.

40:30.162 --> 40:32.529
And they're in nazarovo prison?

40:32.531 --> 40:34.064
Yes.

40:34.065 --> 40:35.598
Are we being sanctioned
to go to russia and rescue them?

40:35.600 --> 40:37.066
No.

40:37.068 --> 40:38.535
Not them.

40:40.172 --> 40:42.939
Just sharov.

40:42.941 --> 40:45.108
The russians could be baiting
us with sharov,

40:45.110 --> 40:46.543
Forcing arkady to work
with them.

40:46.545 --> 40:47.544
Well, that may

40:47.546 --> 40:48.445
Very well be the case.

40:48.447 --> 40:50.263
Hetty,

40:50.264 --> 40:52.080
We're not gonna just leave
arkady to rot.

40:52.083 --> 40:54.918
You asked me

40:54.920 --> 40:56.953
If you were being sanctioned

40:56.955 --> 40:59.556
To rescue arkady.

40:59.558 --> 41:02.792
I already answered
that question.

41:03.762 --> 41:05.462
The agency

41:05.464 --> 41:07.897
Will help you with
some of their contacts,

41:07.899 --> 41:10.834
But they cannot guarantee
your safety.

41:10.836 --> 41:13.203
And if fsb intervenes?

41:13.205 --> 41:16.072
You're there as rogue agents

41:16.074 --> 41:18.241
On an unsanctioned mission.

41:21.246 --> 41:23.480
We'll leave tomorrow morning.

41:23.482 --> 41:25.515
I'll inform the team.

41:25.517 --> 41:26.649
No...

41:28.153 --> 41:31.120
Only the two of you are going.

41:33.992 --> 41:36.626
What do you want to do
about anna?

41:39.831 --> 41:43.600
Sharov is your objective.

41:43.602 --> 41:46.169
Anna's knowledge of russia

41:46.171 --> 41:48.705
Will be useful,
but the moment

41:48.707 --> 41:51.841
She or arkady
compromise your mission,

41:51.843 --> 41:53.276
You cut them loose.

41:55.280 --> 41:56.646
Understood.

42:09.094 --> 42:10.827
