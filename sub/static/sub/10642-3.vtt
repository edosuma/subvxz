WEBVTT

00:00.040 --> 00:01.911
Previously on "The Family"...

00:01.946 --> 00:06.146
I am announcing
my candidacy for governor.

00:06.207 --> 00:08.430
We need to influence
public perception with this.

00:08.497 --> 00:09.696
We'll need the whole family.

00:09.731 --> 00:10.949
I think we go traditional.

00:10.984 --> 00:13.233
Life isn't a straight shot, my friends.

00:13.268 --> 00:15.502
It's full of hills and valleys.

00:15.537 --> 00:17.837
Confront your grief,
and you'll take away its power.

00:17.873 --> 00:19.005
Tell me about the man in the woods.

00:19.041 --> 00:20.473
He has holes in his face.

00:20.509 --> 00:21.975
What about the place he kept you in?

00:22.010 --> 00:23.743
- What could you see?
- A red dragon.

00:23.779 --> 00:25.946
He was breathing fire right at me.

00:25.981 --> 00:27.814
An emergency hearing
was held this morning

00:27.849 --> 00:30.116
which declared Asher a free man.

00:30.152 --> 00:30.951
Where's my mom?

00:30.986 --> 00:32.686
- She passed, Hank.
- Oh.

00:32.720 --> 00:34.120
I didn't take that little boy's ship.

00:34.156 --> 00:35.522
I don't even know how it got there.

00:35.557 --> 00:37.290
My brother used to be a patient here,

00:37.326 --> 00:40.126
and we thought it might be nice
to have his dental records.

00:40.162 --> 00:41.428
Your sister already picked them up.

00:41.463 --> 00:42.529
Oh.

00:42.564 --> 00:45.298
M-My name is Adam.

Have you ever done
something you can't undo...

01:14.630 --> 01:17.931
... you can't forgive, you can't forget?

01:17.966 --> 01:19.216
So you tear yourself apart.

01:19.241 --> 01:20.654
_

01:40.455 --> 01:43.056
Why were you so sure that I was dead?

01:44.826 --> 01:46.393
I don't know.

01:46.428 --> 01:48.995
I was waiting.

01:49.031 --> 01:50.897
Adam...

01:50.932 --> 01:53.466
Why'd you stop looking for me?

01:56.738 --> 01:57.971
I don't know.

02:01.977 --> 02:05.378
Have you ever done something that wrong?

02:07.349 --> 02:09.416
I have.

02:09.451 --> 02:10.750
Daddy?

02:12.587 --> 02:13.887
Did you do it?

02:36.678 --> 02:38.078
What's that smell?

02:38.113 --> 02:40.146
Contempt.

02:40.182 --> 02:41.815
We'll see these on camera...

02:41.850 --> 02:44.017
"Bless this happy home."
"Coolest mom ever."

02:44.052 --> 02:46.886
Uh, "home," so it looks like
Claire crocheted it herself.

02:48.857 --> 02:51.558
The American people want
to know we're in a good place.

02:51.593 --> 02:52.441
We're not.

02:52.466 --> 02:54.461
This interview could get
Mom the endorsement,

02:54.496 --> 02:57.330
so I need you to stay
relatively sober till it's over.

02:57.365 --> 02:58.865
I can go two days without a drink,

02:58.900 --> 03:01.034
- so you don't really have to worry. 
- Just don't overreach.

03:01.069 --> 03:03.770
Just drink to maintain.

03:03.805 --> 03:05.672
Okay, you're gonna put him
on national TV,

03:05.707 --> 03:07.107
and you're worried about me?

03:08.176 --> 03:10.310
What does that say about you?

03:10.345 --> 03:12.145
- Bye, Ad.
- Bye.

03:12.180 --> 03:15.482
Hey, hey, um, is he going
to the dentist anytime soon?

03:15.517 --> 03:17.784
How should I know?

03:26.361 --> 03:29.929
Those bunkers are actually
part of the oil refinery.

03:29.965 --> 03:33.633
So basically anyone who has ever
worked at this refinery

03:33.668 --> 03:36.603
could've known how
to get into that tunnel.

03:36.638 --> 03:38.671
Uh, if you can get us
contact info for current

03:38.707 --> 03:40.940
and former employees,
that would be more than helpful.

03:40.976 --> 03:41.941
That I can do.

03:41.977 --> 03:43.443
How far along?

03:43.478 --> 03:45.044
Oh, technically, six months.

03:45.080 --> 03:46.856
When I try and get off the couch, 20.

03:46.891 --> 03:48.214
- Mm.
- You have kids?

03:48.250 --> 03:50.049
No.

03:50.657 --> 03:53.753
We're not the most modern around here.

03:53.789 --> 03:55.789
Uh, we're computerized from 2002.

03:55.824 --> 03:58.725
Before that, our records
are paper... so much paper.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.193
Paper, paper, paper.

04:00.228 --> 04:02.632
Just send it all over.

04:05.066 --> 04:07.867
Detective Meyer?

04:07.903 --> 04:08.968
Gabe Clements.

04:09.004 --> 04:11.304
I should've introduced myself before.

04:11.339 --> 04:12.972
I was taken with your board over there.

04:13.008 --> 04:15.208
Very, uh, "Beautiful Mind."

04:15.243 --> 04:16.709
Anything else you need from me?

04:17.274 --> 04:18.577
Why? You going somewhere?

04:18.613 --> 04:19.879
Aren't I?

04:19.915 --> 04:21.915
Oh, 'cause I'm the Fed,
I'm supposed to say,

04:21.950 --> 04:23.850
"This is my case
and we play by my rules,

04:23.885 --> 04:24.951
so you're on desk duty"?

04:24.986 --> 04:27.854
You live here. You know the players.

04:27.889 --> 04:29.889
We'll worry about you testifying
in court and all that

04:29.925 --> 04:32.058
when we catch our pock-marked man.

04:32.641 --> 04:34.754
'Cause I'll probably
only catch him if you help me.

04:35.096 --> 04:36.329
You drive.

04:36.364 --> 04:38.331
We'll stop for better coffee on the way.

04:38.366 --> 04:39.867
I like the coffee here.

04:40.969 --> 04:43.770
This is my case,
and we play by my rules.

04:46.174 --> 04:49.075
He set the fire to destroy
any potential forensic evidence,

04:49.110 --> 04:50.476
and so far it's worked.

04:50.512 --> 04:52.579
We're not getting prints or DNA.

04:52.614 --> 04:55.248
And you're sure it's the place?

04:59.955 --> 05:01.454
Oh, my God.

05:01.489 --> 05:02.789
So you came here to tell us that,

05:02.824 --> 05:04.691
or is there something you want?

05:04.726 --> 05:06.870
We'd like Adam to revisit the scene.

05:08.338 --> 05:10.263
The scene of his imprisonment
and torture?

05:10.298 --> 05:12.699
- I know it's a lot to ask for.
- You have no idea.

05:12.734 --> 05:14.567
Just hear her out, Claire.

05:15.323 --> 05:17.203
Our hope is that the visceral experience

05:17.239 --> 05:18.705
of being back there
might trigger some memory.

05:18.740 --> 05:20.440
Or a complete breakdown.

05:20.475 --> 05:22.675
I-I get you want to protect him,
but look at him.

05:22.711 --> 05:24.310
Look what he already survived.

05:24.346 --> 05:26.279
- He's strong.
- You don't hear him at night.

05:26.314 --> 05:27.547
He has nightmares.

05:27.582 --> 05:29.349
No, he's not ready. Let's wait a week.

05:29.384 --> 05:30.950
- I want to go.
- Till your interview's over?

05:30.986 --> 05:32.385
- This isn't about that.
- I want to go.

05:32.420 --> 05:34.546
- The hell it's not.
- I want to go!

05:38.960 --> 05:42.896
I'm not a little kid
that you need to protect.

05:42.931 --> 05:44.831
Not anymore.

05:58.580 --> 06:00.613
- So, when did it start?
- What?

06:00.649 --> 06:02.263
You sleeping with the dad.

06:02.984 --> 06:05.351
I'm FBI. We're perceptive.

06:05.387 --> 06:07.032
Few months after.

06:07.389 --> 06:08.521
I'm not judging.

06:08.556 --> 06:10.723
Just wondering if it ever
clouded your vision.

06:10.759 --> 06:12.529
Hmm, my vision was cloudy before that.

06:13.028 --> 06:14.827
You were looking at
the neighborhood sex offender.

06:14.863 --> 06:17.063
Who wouldn't? But statistically,
most child murders

06:17.098 --> 06:19.032
are someone in the family.

06:20.518 --> 06:21.871
_

06:21.937 --> 06:24.971
So, the kids went to get ice cream.

06:25.006 --> 06:26.439
Mm-hmm. Haven't we been through this?

06:26.474 --> 06:28.135
There are just a few gaps
in our time line.

06:28.510 --> 06:29.734
What gaps?

06:29.769 --> 06:32.478
Was John with you
at the rally the entire time?

06:32.514 --> 06:33.680
Yes, why?

06:33.715 --> 06:36.149
Didn't leave your side,
not even for a second?

06:36.637 --> 06:38.025
I don't think so.

06:38.320 --> 06:39.678
But you're not sure?

06:40.264 --> 06:42.756
I-I was shaking so many hands
that night, I don't...

06:42.791 --> 06:44.257
Maybe he went to the bathroom...

06:44.292 --> 06:46.392
Stoplight camera caught him
driving across town.

06:49.064 --> 06:52.332
Didn't clock him coming back
for over an hour.

06:54.669 --> 06:56.469
What are you trying to say?

07:15.949 --> 07:17.248
I want to know where you went, John.

07:17.284 --> 07:20.552
I went to get more fliers.
I told you that already.

07:21.275 --> 07:23.054
Well, they said that you
were gone for an hour.

07:23.090 --> 07:25.457
Why would it take an hour
to get fliers? I...

07:25.492 --> 07:28.090
I-I-I turned on the game, okay?

07:29.096 --> 07:30.228
It was the last quarter.

07:30.263 --> 07:32.497
The kids were off.
You were fine by yourself.

07:32.532 --> 07:37.869
So I drank a beer, and I turned
on the damn game, okay?

07:39.997 --> 07:41.172
Okay?

07:43.413 --> 07:45.381
- It sounds lame, John.
- What?

07:45.406 --> 07:47.459
It sounds like a made-up story.
I'm sorry. It just...

07:47.555 --> 07:48.826
Would... Would you
like to ask me something?

07:48.851 --> 07:49.688
No, don't. But, ye...

07:49.724 --> 07:50.703
'Cause it sounds like you
really, really want to.

07:50.728 --> 07:51.697
No, really. Stop it.

07:51.722 --> 07:54.193
- Stop, stop.
- If you honestly believe

07:54.228 --> 07:56.495
- that I am capable of hurting someone...
- Okay, all right.

07:56.530 --> 07:58.263
- All right. Do you want me to ask you?
- ...let alone my own son!

07:58.299 --> 08:00.199
- Where were you, John?!
- I told you!

08:00.234 --> 08:02.701
You are lying!

08:02.737 --> 08:04.670
I'm exhausted. I'm confused.

08:04.705 --> 08:08.109
I just... just want him back.

08:10.311 --> 08:11.843
You think I don't?

08:11.878 --> 08:13.598
Every day I want him back.

08:17.244 --> 08:19.562
But the hell if I'd ever turn on you.

08:43.070 --> 08:43.958
Honey...

08:45.005 --> 08:46.616
You don't need to do this.

08:53.247 --> 08:54.713
Ad?

08:54.748 --> 08:56.615
I want to.

08:58.213 --> 09:00.419
Careful... there's plastic on the steps.

09:00.454 --> 09:02.629
We're still processing
evidence down there.

09:12.266 --> 09:13.765
You coming?

09:13.801 --> 09:15.756
I just... I-I just need a minute.

09:16.470 --> 09:17.402
Mom?

09:18.906 --> 09:21.395
You don't have to do this, either.

09:39.441 --> 09:41.827
Hi. Can I help you?

09:41.862 --> 09:44.796
I want to buy a puppy.

09:55.609 --> 09:58.143
Bows on the girls
and bandanas on the boys.

09:58.178 --> 10:00.712
Otherwise, it's all
one big ball of cute.

10:03.717 --> 10:06.718
Okay, Mr. Hank, climb on in.

10:06.753 --> 10:08.653
Why?

10:08.689 --> 10:10.555
To pick your puppy.

10:25.572 --> 10:28.073
Or if you really want a friend for life,

10:28.108 --> 10:29.975
let the puppy pick you.

10:30.010 --> 10:32.210
Ooh! Oh, my!

10:33.447 --> 10:35.280
You're gonna be a great daddy, Hank.

10:35.315 --> 10:37.449
Anything coming back, Adam?

10:37.484 --> 10:38.984
Yeah.

10:39.019 --> 10:41.052
I remember everything.

10:41.088 --> 10:43.855
That's where I slept.

10:43.891 --> 10:45.590
Over there was the bathroom.

10:45.626 --> 10:48.326
- Did you have a... a...
- Bucket.

10:48.362 --> 10:50.792
This was my kitchen.

10:51.832 --> 10:54.582
But that right there...

10:56.069 --> 10:58.336
was the dining room.

11:00.607 --> 11:03.608
I saved it for when
he brought good food.

11:03.644 --> 11:05.143
What was good?

11:05.179 --> 11:07.377
Hamburgers and fries.

11:08.749 --> 11:12.304
Anything have a logo?
The bag or the boxes?

11:13.187 --> 11:15.554
No, he always unwrapped it first.

11:15.589 --> 11:18.490
Always? How often did he bring it?

11:18.525 --> 11:21.960
About once every seven sleeps.

11:21.995 --> 11:25.130
And was it warm, the food?

11:25.165 --> 11:27.465
That's what made it good.

11:27.501 --> 11:28.533
Three miles from the road

11:28.569 --> 11:29.901
and eight from the edge of the woods,

11:29.937 --> 11:31.469
but the food was warm?

11:31.505 --> 11:34.239
Maybe he hiked it in
in some kind of insulated bag.

11:34.274 --> 11:36.450
Yeah, or maybe he drove.

11:37.411 --> 11:39.911
We'll fan out, look for tire tracks.

11:39.947 --> 11:41.082
It's worth a shot.

11:50.891 --> 11:55.360
Could I have a minute... alone?

11:55.395 --> 11:56.946
Down here? You sure?

11:58.098 --> 11:59.544
Just a minute.

12:02.669 --> 12:05.837
I'll be right out there
if you need me, okay, bud?

12:05.872 --> 12:07.472
Yeah.

13:15.127 --> 13:16.393
Do you think I killed him?

13:16.428 --> 13:19.295
Do you think I killed my son?!

13:27.773 --> 13:29.205
Drink.

13:29.241 --> 13:31.408
That guy Asher...
I-I saw him this morning

13:31.443 --> 13:33.109
just walking in the bagel shop,

13:33.145 --> 13:35.612
buying a bagel and schmear
like it's a normal day.

13:35.647 --> 13:38.314
He's a regular guy...
nothing to see here.

13:38.350 --> 13:40.817
Trying to get a warrant
to search his house.

13:40.852 --> 13:42.318
It's just not that easy.

13:42.354 --> 13:44.421
Do you think I'm lying?

13:44.456 --> 13:45.855
My wife does.

13:47.135 --> 13:48.324
No.

13:48.360 --> 13:49.888
Do you think I did something?

13:51.096 --> 13:53.363
'Cause if you do, arrest me.
If not, then...

13:53.398 --> 13:55.304
I think you love your son.

13:56.742 --> 14:00.189
I think you love him so much
you're drowning without him.

14:25.997 --> 14:29.557
Tell me what it was like... down there.

14:30.765 --> 14:32.402
Thought you didn't want to know.

14:33.537 --> 14:35.587
Just tell me.

14:38.376 --> 14:40.915
Well, he, um...

14:41.680 --> 14:44.314
he set it up just like our house.

14:45.884 --> 14:47.548
Bathroom here,

14:48.019 --> 14:50.523
kitchen, bedroom,

14:51.203 --> 14:53.056
dining room.

14:55.760 --> 14:58.380
Even at 8 years old,
he remembered the layout.

14:59.833 --> 15:00.898
Do you want me to...

15:00.933 --> 15:02.298
It's okay. Keep going.

15:02.334 --> 15:05.368
Uh... big space.

15:07.305 --> 15:08.820
It's high, not wide.

15:09.474 --> 15:12.375
There's, um...

15:12.410 --> 15:15.612
smaller spaces inside it,
like niches, and...

15:17.149 --> 15:18.796
It was dark.

15:20.952 --> 15:22.519
Cold.

15:22.554 --> 15:24.687
No natural light.
The brick walls are concrete.

15:24.723 --> 15:27.257
In terms of optics, colors
can really make or break you.

15:27.292 --> 15:29.826
We've found that Republican
voters respond best

15:29.861 --> 15:32.028
to female candidates in red or blue.

15:32.063 --> 15:33.997
To think I might have worn green.

15:34.032 --> 15:35.165
Crisis averted.

15:37.035 --> 15:39.335
Uh, to keep you on message,
I've assembled a list

15:39.371 --> 15:41.271
of RNC talking points for the interview.

15:41.306 --> 15:44.374
- Oh, great.
- I need to be myself here.

15:45.577 --> 15:48.578
And we've gone the extra mile

15:48.613 --> 15:50.280
and hired you an image consultant.

15:50.315 --> 15:52.231
Perfect.
No, no.
That won't be necessary.

15:53.295 --> 15:54.318
You're going to be

15:54.352 --> 15:56.119
on the national stage tomorrow, Claire.

15:56.154 --> 15:57.820
It can be intimidating and exhausting.

15:57.856 --> 15:59.222
Are you getting enough sleep?

15:59.257 --> 16:01.291
- I will make sure of it.
- No, you know what's exhausting?

16:01.326 --> 16:03.793
Sleeping on a closet floor
with an innocent child

16:03.828 --> 16:05.895
who was kept in a bunker for 10 years.

16:08.833 --> 16:11.251
Tell me what color you want me
to wear, I'll wear it.

16:12.624 --> 16:15.906
She's a little on edge,
but when the time comes,

16:15.941 --> 16:17.874
she will knock it out of the park.

16:17.909 --> 16:19.909
The time is tomorrow.

16:20.460 --> 16:22.806
If you want our endorsement
and our money,

16:23.310 --> 16:25.748
we need to feel confident
that she'll toe the party line.

16:25.784 --> 16:29.619
And right now, we don't.

16:36.528 --> 16:37.994
You're a grad student where now?

16:38.029 --> 16:40.597
- Maine Tech... forensic science.
- That's right. Sorry.

16:40.632 --> 16:41.764
We've been pulling all-nighters

16:41.800 --> 16:44.367
trying to beta this baby...
tracking microchip.

16:44.402 --> 16:46.769
This one's bioengineered
to graft with human cells.

16:46.805 --> 16:48.285
It's gonna be huge. I mean,
I haven't stopped...

16:48.310 --> 16:48.805
Oh. You know what?

16:48.840 --> 16:51.774
But, actually, my focus is more
on DNA analysis.

16:51.810 --> 16:54.644
I heard you guys did
the I.D. test on Adam Warren.

16:54.679 --> 16:55.878
Where'd you hear that from?

16:55.914 --> 16:58.414
You did, though, right?
How did that all work?

16:58.450 --> 16:59.849
Like, what happened
when the samples came in?

16:59.884 --> 17:02.685
Um, I'm not really supposed
to talk about that.

17:03.223 --> 17:06.489
I-It would really help my thesis.

17:27.712 --> 17:29.846
Your leg is like shaving a lemur.

17:29.881 --> 17:32.448
- Shut up.
- You're like a college dude, Cruz.

17:32.484 --> 17:34.150
Oh, do you think we just sit around

17:34.185 --> 17:35.718
groomed and ready all the time?

17:35.754 --> 17:37.887
That's what you get for
booty-calling on a Tuesday.

17:37.922 --> 17:40.923
I'm not drinking, okay? So I needed sex.

17:40.959 --> 17:42.492
Oh, that's so romantic.

17:43.928 --> 17:44.994
- No, leave it.
- No, no.

17:45.030 --> 17:46.462
I-I... It might be my brother.

17:46.498 --> 17:48.264
I got to pick him up from therapy.

17:52.504 --> 17:55.438
Well, hurry up, because,
uh, I'm doing you next.

17:55.473 --> 17:57.273
All right, all right.

17:57.309 --> 17:58.441
Whew!

17:58.476 --> 18:01.477
Um, you live like
a college dude, too, Cruz.

18:01.513 --> 18:03.980
A clean house is a misspent life.

18:05.083 --> 18:07.050
You have three new messages.

18:07.085 --> 18:10.853
To listen to your messages,
press "1" now.

18:15.994 --> 18:17.393
Danny?

18:17.429 --> 18:18.695
Yeah, in a minute.

18:20.131 --> 18:22.598
So, how is he, your brother?

18:28.472 --> 18:30.584
Was it your brother?

18:34.845 --> 18:36.845
For real, you are like a stalker.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.352
Senior Executive Director
of Photocopying at Kinkos.

18:58.197 --> 19:00.197
Hey, is everything o...

19:11.697 --> 19:13.697
_

19:18.624 --> 19:20.957
Why were you in Hank Asher's house?

19:53.092 --> 19:54.691
We know who did this.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.126
Willa!

19:56.161 --> 19:59.196
It wasn't you.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.532
What did you do?

20:08.006 --> 20:09.439
Oh, I found Danny's secret stash.

20:09.475 --> 20:10.554
Guess where it was.

20:10.976 --> 20:12.509
I don't care.

20:12.544 --> 20:14.277
Mm, ah.

20:14.313 --> 20:17.030
I know alcoholics drink
for volume, not flavor,

20:17.657 --> 20:19.315
but this taste like burnt hair.

20:19.351 --> 20:21.451
Did you even look at the talking points?

20:21.487 --> 20:23.899
You know what? I didn't.

20:24.439 --> 20:26.523
I did not.

20:26.878 --> 20:29.793
This endorsement is the race.

20:30.303 --> 20:31.905
Your father saw it today...

20:32.999 --> 20:34.731
the place where Adam was kept.

20:37.436 --> 20:39.180
No windows.

20:39.505 --> 20:40.874
No sunlight.

20:41.473 --> 20:42.638
No weather.

20:43.041 --> 20:44.668
No clocks.

20:45.544 --> 20:48.076
A concrete pit.

20:50.460 --> 20:52.048
I'm so sorry.

20:54.052 --> 20:57.087
I'm sorry I spent all
those years taking showers

20:58.475 --> 21:00.359
and reading magazines

21:01.491 --> 21:03.959
and complaining
about I don't know what...

21:03.996 --> 21:05.865
Wi-Fi not working...

21:06.721 --> 21:10.867
while my little boy was alone,
growing up in a hole.

21:14.206 --> 21:16.162
They want me to say we're fine.

21:18.049 --> 21:20.169
They want to know you can win.

21:21.532 --> 21:23.313
I'm supposed to go
on national television

21:23.348 --> 21:26.783
and soft-pedal it... act like
it just didn't even happen.

21:27.078 --> 21:28.084
Yes.

21:28.411 --> 21:29.519
And what does that get me?

21:30.387 --> 21:31.688
Power.

21:32.634 --> 21:35.057
And power protects other kids.

21:44.536 --> 21:46.570
We find any tire tracks yet?

21:46.605 --> 21:48.472
Nothing that wasn't
from department vehicles

21:48.507 --> 21:49.439
or the fire crew.

21:49.475 --> 21:51.139
We just widened the perimeter.

21:51.810 --> 21:53.877
Well, if you need a break,
I can stand around here

21:53.912 --> 21:55.812
and look annoyed
and impatient for a while.

21:57.816 --> 21:59.182
You have kids, Detective?

21:59.218 --> 22:00.817
Why do people keep asking me that?

22:00.853 --> 22:02.352
Well, some agents think having kids

22:02.387 --> 22:04.154
makes them better
at working kid cases...

22:04.189 --> 22:07.257
makes them more intuitive,
more empathetic.

22:07.292 --> 22:09.087
Those agents are wrong.

22:10.386 --> 22:11.761
Being able to identify firsthand

22:11.797 --> 22:14.998
with a parent whose child
has been tortured, murdered?

22:15.435 --> 22:17.901
It'll help you
feel their pain, for sure.

22:18.609 --> 22:20.103
But they don't want you
to feel their pain.

22:20.138 --> 22:21.938
They want you to do your job.

22:21.974 --> 22:23.440
Treads... four sets.

22:23.475 --> 22:25.308
Looks like they're all
from the same vehicle.

22:25.344 --> 22:26.810
We're having them cast in plaster.

22:26.845 --> 22:28.411
We I.D. those tires,

22:28.447 --> 22:30.080
then see if anyone who's ever worked

22:30.115 --> 22:31.882
for the oil refinery
drives that vehicle.

22:31.917 --> 22:33.183
We're getting there!

22:33.218 --> 22:36.119
We better be,
before he hurts someone else.

23:28.040 --> 23:29.725
Oh! Oh, God.

23:30.658 --> 23:32.175
You are early.

23:32.210 --> 23:33.977
I am still cooking.

23:34.012 --> 23:35.946
I couldn't wait to see my baby.

23:35.981 --> 23:38.014
- Aww.
- Both my babies.

23:38.050 --> 23:39.449
Aww.

23:39.484 --> 23:41.184
- Hi.
- Hi.

23:41.219 --> 23:42.252
Mm.

23:42.287 --> 23:43.653
All four sets of tracks in the woods

23:43.689 --> 23:45.024
are from the same vehicle.

23:45.524 --> 23:47.791
We I.D.'d them as 22-inch
Achilles Desert Hawks.

23:47.826 --> 23:50.248
They're used in '04 and '08 Ram trucks.

23:50.896 --> 23:52.195
I would high-five you,

23:52.230 --> 23:53.997
but I want to keep
this moment cheese-free.

23:54.032 --> 23:55.298
We're cross-referencing

23:55.334 --> 23:57.400
the digital employment records
from the oil refinery.

23:57.436 --> 23:58.802
Come on, up top.

23:58.837 --> 24:02.368
- You know what I keep meaning to ask? 
- Hmm?

24:02.403 --> 24:05.809
Case file said a 911 call
got you into Asher's house.

24:05.844 --> 24:08.078
That's how you got around
not having a warrant?

24:08.113 --> 24:09.679
Yeah, so?

24:09.715 --> 24:12.749
So the caller said they heard
screaming coming from inside.

24:12.784 --> 24:13.783
Was there any?

24:13.819 --> 24:15.318
Not when I got there.

24:15.354 --> 24:17.554
Ever find out who made that call?

24:17.589 --> 24:19.623
Uh, I didn't have to. A-Asher confessed.

24:19.658 --> 24:21.324
He took a 30-year plea.

24:21.360 --> 24:22.792
Well, I guess you don't question it

24:22.828 --> 24:24.060
when you get what you want.

24:24.999 --> 24:26.086
_

24:28.266 --> 24:29.599
Daddy?

24:29.635 --> 24:31.334
Did you do it?

24:33.238 --> 24:34.358
Yeah.

24:34.940 --> 24:37.173
So what happens now?

24:41.046 --> 24:43.630
We wait.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.951
Got a 911 call of a disturbance

24:47.986 --> 24:49.686
at 18 White Knoll Terrace.

24:50.786 --> 24:52.422
That's Hank Asher's place.

24:52.457 --> 24:54.858
Screaming coming from
the upstairs is all they said.

24:54.893 --> 24:56.526
I'm on it. Send backup.

25:39.237 --> 25:41.271
- Move, move, move!
- Clear!

25:41.306 --> 25:43.306
Go! Go! Clear!

26:05.964 --> 26:07.864
Hey, got your message.

26:10.602 --> 26:12.068
Did you find something?

26:15.707 --> 26:17.707
911. What's your emergency?

26:17.743 --> 26:19.075
There's some, uh, screaming

26:19.111 --> 26:20.510
coming from an upstairs bedroom.

26:20.545 --> 26:22.178
I can't tell who it is... maybe a kid.

26:22.214 --> 26:23.346
Someone's being hurt.

26:23.381 --> 26:24.914
What number are you calling from?

26:24.950 --> 26:26.783
I can't make it out. It's a pay phone.

26:26.818 --> 26:28.218
Do you have an address, sir?

26:28.253 --> 26:30.086
18 White Knoll Terrace.

26:30.122 --> 26:31.454
I was just walking, and I heard it.

26:31.490 --> 26:34.224
Y-You need to send the police right now.

26:34.259 --> 26:35.992
Can I get your name, sir?

26:36.027 --> 26:37.861
- Sir?

26:44.002 --> 26:45.769
You needed to get in that house.

26:46.236 --> 26:47.816
And you got me in.

26:49.176 --> 26:50.907
I thought he did it, okay?

26:50.942 --> 26:53.042
I thought he took my son.

26:53.078 --> 26:54.677
And you framed him for it.

26:54.713 --> 26:56.179
Well, we all knew he was the guy.

26:56.214 --> 26:57.814
It was just a matter of proving it.

26:58.115 --> 26:59.982
The underwear drawer...
it was a nice touch.

27:00.685 --> 27:02.982
Little on the nose, but super creepy.

27:04.689 --> 27:08.091
I wanted to get him, just like you.

27:08.896 --> 27:10.675
Do you think that we're the same?

27:11.429 --> 27:15.365
I thought what I was doing was right.

27:16.332 --> 27:18.902
You knew what you were doing was wrong

27:18.937 --> 27:20.937
the second that you did it.

27:22.573 --> 27:25.208
Your kid in that hellhole...
that will always be on me.

27:25.587 --> 27:27.377
But it's on me 'cause of you.

27:33.785 --> 27:35.807
Get out of my sight.

27:53.091 --> 27:54.224
What are you doing?

27:54.259 --> 27:56.226
Looking for his dental records.

27:56.261 --> 27:57.627
What?

27:57.662 --> 27:58.895
Don't try lying, Willa.

27:58.930 --> 28:00.230
They already told me
that you picked them up.

28:00.265 --> 28:01.650
You need help.

28:01.685 --> 28:03.751
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

28:03.925 --> 28:05.258
Mom asked me to pick them up.

28:05.293 --> 28:06.993
- His doctors wanted them.
- Oh, come on.

28:07.028 --> 28:08.594
What is wrong with you?

28:08.630 --> 28:10.263
Why can't you just be happy he's back?

28:10.298 --> 28:12.064
Because he's not back.

28:15.069 --> 28:17.270
You really haven't done
enough damage here?

28:17.305 --> 28:18.504
What's that supposed to mean?

28:18.540 --> 28:19.939
You should've been watching us.

28:19.974 --> 28:21.027
Oh, so this is all my fault now?

28:21.074 --> 28:23.107
I was 13, and you left me alone
to handle it.

28:23.142 --> 28:26.511
- Kids get lost, okay? I'm sorry.
- No, people lose them!

28:31.584 --> 28:34.277
They're ready to mike you downstairs.

28:36.597 --> 28:38.550
Please don't screw this up for us, too.

28:41.995 --> 28:44.996
Past 10 years, you've lived
every family's nightmare.

28:45.031 --> 28:47.665
It's the worst day of your lives.

28:47.700 --> 28:49.567
The one moment you're together, happy,

28:49.602 --> 28:54.235
and the next, your son,
your brother is gone, vanished.

28:54.835 --> 28:57.808
But unlike countless
other families in this country,

28:57.844 --> 29:00.411
you actually got a happy ending.

29:01.020 --> 29:02.847
The nightmare became a wish come true.

29:02.882 --> 29:04.532
It did, Julia. Mm-hmm.

29:04.784 --> 29:08.152
So, I guess, for all the people
who have followed your story

29:08.187 --> 29:10.081
and are watching tonight,

29:10.116 --> 29:13.491
the obvious first question
has to be, how are you?

29:13.526 --> 29:15.059
We're doing great.

29:15.094 --> 29:17.828
We really are, Julia. We are.

29:17.864 --> 29:19.830
Um, you know, we have a long way to go,

29:19.866 --> 29:21.265
but I know we'll get there.

29:21.898 --> 29:24.891
Adam, it's so nice to see you
with your family.

29:25.378 --> 29:26.304
How are you doing?

29:26.339 --> 29:29.185
What's it like to be back?

29:30.043 --> 29:31.442
Good.

29:32.184 --> 29:35.780
I never stopped hoping
they would find me.

29:37.612 --> 29:38.937
And, Willa, Danny,

29:38.972 --> 29:40.959
how is it sitting
with your little brother?

29:41.059 --> 29:42.558
Did you ever think this was possible?

29:43.529 --> 29:46.230
I wanted to, but, as you said,

29:46.264 --> 29:49.201
so few people, uh,
have a happy ending like this.

29:50.027 --> 29:51.281
Danny, what about you?

29:55.840 --> 29:57.740
I thought he was dead, so...

30:00.574 --> 30:02.646
No, I didn't think we'd see him again.

30:04.915 --> 30:06.218
And now?

30:09.571 --> 30:11.131
It's like he never left.

30:11.923 --> 30:16.659
Let me ask you, John, Claire,
most marriages

30:16.694 --> 30:20.730
that go through the trauma
of losing a child can't recover.

30:20.765 --> 30:23.898
So what kept you two so strong
through all this?

30:27.071 --> 30:28.971
Um...

30:29.007 --> 30:32.174
I think it was just our bond, you know?

30:32.243 --> 30:34.644
Um, and also, we had two other kids,

30:34.679 --> 30:36.590
so we needed to be there for them.

30:37.949 --> 30:39.382
You were right.

30:40.718 --> 30:42.006
Tastes like ass.

30:43.621 --> 30:47.060
We got names and addresses
of the Ram truck owners.

30:47.778 --> 30:49.582
So, uh, unless you want
to keep watching,

30:50.015 --> 30:51.835
let's go get our pock-marked man.

30:52.402 --> 30:54.751
And what about now
that Adam's back, Claire?

30:54.966 --> 30:57.133
I mean, again, it's a dream come true.

30:57.168 --> 30:59.335
But at the same time, the readjustment

30:59.370 --> 31:01.971
and with the attention,
the media, the election,

31:02.006 --> 31:02.883
how do you handle all that?

31:02.919 --> 31:04.407
Well, it's not easy, Julia.

31:04.442 --> 31:06.295
It's, um... You know, we're...

31:07.962 --> 31:10.046
uh, just trying to take it slow.

31:17.943 --> 31:19.756
Claire, are you okay?

31:19.791 --> 31:21.590
No, I'm not.

31:23.494 --> 31:25.814
We are so lucky
to have gotten our son back,

31:26.264 --> 31:27.670
but we are not okay.

31:28.131 --> 31:30.499
And, honestly, I don't know
if we're ever going to be okay.

31:30.535 --> 31:34.470
A thing like this, it, uh...
it changes you forever.

31:34.825 --> 31:39.075
That's a very candid
and understandable perspective,

31:39.110 --> 31:41.711
but does it also enable
your detractors when they say

31:41.746 --> 31:43.212
that this might not be the best time

31:43.247 --> 31:44.947
for you to be entering
the governor's race?

31:44.982 --> 31:46.849
Well, you know,
how can I worry about that?

31:46.884 --> 31:48.484
Because it is exactly this experience

31:48.519 --> 31:50.340
that makes me want
to make our state safer.

31:50.988 --> 31:53.089
It is this experience

31:53.124 --> 31:55.958
that has informed and
strengthened me for that fight.

31:55.993 --> 31:58.794
And anyone who looks
at the violent-crime statistics

31:58.830 --> 32:00.830
in this country knows that a fight

32:00.865 --> 32:02.742
is exactly what we have on our hands.

32:02.778 --> 32:04.989
You think we're not doing enough
as a nation to fight crime?

32:05.025 --> 32:06.302
No, I know we're not.

32:06.337 --> 32:08.738
Um, there are monsters
all around us every day,

32:08.773 --> 32:10.051
and we need to protect ourselves.

32:10.608 --> 32:12.341
Monsters?

32:12.377 --> 32:15.144
Would you consider your neighbor
Hank Asher a monster?

32:15.179 --> 32:17.079
Yeah, absolutely. Yes, yes, I would.

32:17.115 --> 32:18.748
Even though Mr. Asher was innocent?

32:18.783 --> 32:20.583
He may have been innocent
of taking Adam,

32:20.618 --> 32:23.419
but, um, he's not innocent.

32:23.454 --> 32:25.988
He was a convicted sex offender,
Julia, after all.

32:26.023 --> 32:27.223
Let's not forget that.

32:27.258 --> 32:29.425
And statistics show
that sex criminals re-offend

32:29.460 --> 32:31.394
exponentially more often
than they don't.

32:31.462 --> 32:34.497
Even after incarceration, treatment,

32:34.532 --> 32:38.200
reha... after our best efforts
at rehabilitation,

32:38.236 --> 32:41.137
we let them report
their own whereabouts?

32:41.172 --> 32:43.157
We currently trust them to keep
current with their own parole?

32:43.182 --> 32:44.440
I hope that you and Annie...

32:44.475 --> 32:46.142
-We let these people police themselves. 
- ...will be very happy together, Hank.

32:46.177 --> 32:47.710
Here you go.

32:47.745 --> 32:49.478
Ooh.

32:49.514 --> 32:50.713
Oh.

32:53.050 --> 32:54.884
You're that guy.

32:54.919 --> 32:56.352
What?

32:56.387 --> 32:58.387
Mom, it's on TV right now.

32:58.423 --> 33:00.471
He's the guy they thought took that kid.

33:01.392 --> 33:02.804
What are you talking about, Sarah?

33:02.839 --> 33:04.687
He's a child molester.

33:08.332 --> 33:10.476
So, what's the solution, Claire?

33:10.511 --> 33:12.134
Trackable microchips.

33:12.170 --> 33:14.503
Y-You mean like the ones
people put in their dogs?

33:14.539 --> 33:15.938
Well, you can put them in anyone now.

33:15.973 --> 33:19.108
So it seems reasonable
to at least suggest

33:19.143 --> 33:21.110
that people who can't be trusted

33:21.145 --> 33:23.979
not to hurt our children
be chipped and tracked.

33:24.015 --> 33:27.750
If they've changed,
if prison has cured them,

33:27.785 --> 33:29.318
there would be nothing to track.

33:29.353 --> 33:32.154
But if it hasn't,
there would be nowhere to hide.

33:32.190 --> 33:33.456
And in the case

33:33.491 --> 33:35.443
of the rush to judgment of Hank Asher,

33:35.468 --> 33:39.094
if he had been chipped immediately

33:39.130 --> 33:41.063
after being convicted
of his first sex offense,

33:41.098 --> 33:42.131
we could've cleared him...

33:42.166 --> 33:44.967
of Adam's kidnapping, anyway.

33:45.002 --> 33:46.836
Trackable microchips.

33:46.871 --> 33:48.537
We've been pulling all-nighters trying

33:48.573 --> 33:50.339
to beta this baby... tracking microchip.

33:50.374 --> 33:51.474
It's gonna be huge.

33:51.509 --> 33:53.509
Did she just say that, as governor,

33:53.544 --> 33:55.478
she's gonna microchip perverts?

33:55.513 --> 33:56.979
And the lab that processed

33:57.014 --> 33:58.948
Adam's DNA tests could make millions.

33:58.983 --> 34:00.749
So work your source.

34:00.785 --> 34:03.018
I don't have one anymore.

34:03.054 --> 34:05.321
What's next for this family, Claire?

34:05.356 --> 34:06.822
A big campaign?

34:06.858 --> 34:08.864
Uh, well...

34:10.995 --> 34:14.697
I stayed in politics
because I truly believed

34:14.732 --> 34:18.100
that I could make a difference
and make us safer.

34:18.135 --> 34:19.824
I still want that.

34:20.737 --> 34:25.107
But if people need to know
that we're okay to vote for me,

34:25.141 --> 34:29.178
I don't think I should lie
and say that we are.

34:29.213 --> 34:32.248
It is a disservice to anyone

34:32.283 --> 34:33.882
who has experienced trauma

34:33.918 --> 34:36.568
and to their families
and to their children.

34:38.255 --> 34:41.456
I ca... I-I'm sorry.

34:41.492 --> 34:42.944
I just, uh... I have to stop.

34:43.494 --> 34:46.462
I, uh... I just can't right now.

34:57.825 --> 34:59.915
Hello? Nina.

35:01.061 --> 35:02.261
Oh, my God.

35:02.296 --> 35:04.696
- Did they arrest someone?
- Yeah. Uh...

35:04.732 --> 35:07.933
No, okay. Yeah, no, w-we'll be here.

35:07.968 --> 35:08.967
Thank you.

35:09.003 --> 35:09.935
What?

35:11.739 --> 35:13.005
Asher confessed.

35:13.040 --> 35:14.273
What did he say?

35:14.308 --> 35:16.408
She just said he confessed.

35:19.146 --> 35:20.989
Oh, my God.

35:32.560 --> 35:34.893
I'm sorry.

35:34.929 --> 35:36.061
I know.

35:36.096 --> 35:38.030
I never really thought it, John.

35:39.483 --> 35:40.898
No, I know.

35:55.316 --> 35:56.782
I thought you did great.

35:56.817 --> 35:59.551
Not that I matter, but what you said

35:59.587 --> 36:03.522
and how you said it, I-I heard
you in it... the old you.

36:04.069 --> 36:05.624
Might have cost me the race.

36:06.732 --> 36:08.298
Well, even better.

36:10.831 --> 36:13.365
# Mamabear is trending.

36:13.400 --> 36:16.168
Individually, those are
all words I understand.

36:16.203 --> 36:18.687
But together... no idea.

36:19.506 --> 36:23.408
Your message is out there
basically spinning itself.

36:23.444 --> 36:26.345
But next time, I need to know
what the plan is.

36:26.380 --> 36:28.180
Unless part of it is for me to look like

36:28.215 --> 36:29.982
I'm having a heart attack on nation TV,

36:30.017 --> 36:32.117
in which case, mission accomplished.

36:32.152 --> 36:33.885
What are you talking about?

36:33.921 --> 36:36.789
I-I should know
if you're gonna go rogue.

36:37.358 --> 36:39.558
Do you think that I planned all that?

36:39.917 --> 36:40.592
Didn't you?

36:41.557 --> 36:42.661
Oh.

36:42.696 --> 36:44.320
Don't be so cynical.

36:44.732 --> 36:47.833
It gives you wrinkles on your soul.

37:44.158 --> 37:46.591
Mayor Claire Warren lit up
social media tonight

37:46.627 --> 37:48.360
when she vowed to microchip

37:48.395 --> 37:50.996
convicted sex offenders
if elected governor.

37:51.031 --> 37:53.932
Stay tuned for more updates
on the story after this.

38:11.185 --> 38:12.951
I got your story.

38:37.811 --> 38:39.144
Have you always owned that truck?

38:39.179 --> 38:41.012
Never loaned it to anyone?

38:43.751 --> 38:45.851
Thanks. Have a good night.

38:54.795 --> 38:56.461
Ad?

38:56.497 --> 38:58.630
I'm sorry.

38:59.867 --> 39:02.067
It's okay.

39:02.102 --> 39:03.135
You didn't mean to.

39:03.170 --> 39:05.170
I messed up. I'm sorry.

39:05.205 --> 39:06.412
It's okay.

39:07.520 --> 39:09.207
You just...

39:11.178 --> 39:13.145
You can't look at me like that.

39:15.749 --> 39:18.984
I'm your sister, Ad.

39:23.424 --> 39:24.793
I-I know.

39:26.948 --> 39:29.294
I'm your sister.

39:31.598 --> 39:32.731
I know.

39:42.209 --> 39:44.943
Have you ever done
something you couldn't undo?

39:47.748 --> 39:50.348
It was a good idea, Meyer,

39:50.384 --> 39:52.417
but you'll have more ideas,

39:52.453 --> 39:55.654
and one of them
will be the one that gets him.

39:55.689 --> 39:56.712
Mint?

39:57.357 --> 39:59.724
An offer, not a hint.

39:59.760 --> 40:01.197
You're wrong, by the way.

40:02.029 --> 40:04.463
Why? You have onions
for lunch or something?

40:04.498 --> 40:07.314
You need to get close
to people to do what we do.

40:08.101 --> 40:10.902
If you don't connect,
you're lacking empathy.

40:10.938 --> 40:13.238
And... without empathy,

40:13.273 --> 40:17.241
a case is nothing more
than a puzzle to be solved.

40:17.978 --> 40:19.778
- So?
- So cases are not puzzles.

40:19.813 --> 40:21.675
They're people.

40:22.249 --> 40:24.716
He's a person. He will screw up.

40:24.751 --> 40:27.586
And that's how we'll get him.

40:30.157 --> 40:32.123
You can't let go of what you've done,

40:32.192 --> 40:33.892
so you punish yourself.

40:33.927 --> 40:35.961
That's what most of us do, anyway.

40:37.965 --> 40:39.664
Oh, gosh. I'm gonna fall.

40:39.700 --> 40:40.732
I'm too top-heavy.

40:40.767 --> 40:41.900
I got you. I got you.

40:41.935 --> 40:43.335
- Okay.
- We're almost there.

40:43.370 --> 40:45.403
Okay.

40:45.439 --> 40:46.938
You ready?

40:46.974 --> 40:48.173
Yeah.

40:48.208 --> 40:49.374
Surprise.

40:49.409 --> 40:53.044
Oh, Doug! We can't afford this!

40:53.113 --> 40:56.081
- I sold my truck.
- How...

40:56.116 --> 40:58.750
But a lucky few don't feel the guilt...

41:00.687 --> 41:04.789
... because they never had
a conscience to begin with.
