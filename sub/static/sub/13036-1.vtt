00:13.080 --> 00:14.912
You're blocking the TV!
Move!

00:15.360 --> 00:18.637
Who's gonna vacuum
the floor then? You?

00:20.200 --> 00:22.920
How can I watch TV
with your ass in the way?

00:23.400 --> 00:25.073
Let me finish this first!

00:28.160 --> 00:31.870
Stupid cow!
I'm missing my show!

00:32.960 --> 00:34.553
Go fix the light!

00:35.080 --> 00:37.436
You can stick your lights
up your ass!

00:40.080 --> 00:41.958
Vera, where's the money?

00:42.560 --> 00:43.914
What money?

00:44.280 --> 00:47.990
You know what money.
- I haven't got any.

00:48.520 --> 00:50.751
I spent the last of it
on bread yesterday.

00:50.920 --> 00:52.274
Nothing left till payday.

00:53.520 --> 00:56.319
I hid some under the shelf
in the cupboard.

00:56.720 --> 00:58.074
Oh yes?

00:58.800 --> 01:02.680
There's no food at home,
and you have a stash?

01:05.000 --> 01:09.153
Where's the money?
Can't you see I'm shaking?

01:10.760 --> 01:12.672
Kolya, I didn't take it.

01:13.320 --> 01:15.880
I'm gonna beat your face in.

01:16.840 --> 01:21.790
I swear I didn't take it.
Please don't hit me.

How on earth did I end up
with a lazy parasite like you?

01:33.400 --> 01:36.359
Laying on the couch
all day like a log!

01:36.880 --> 01:38.633
I can't take it anymore!

01:42.120 --> 01:43.395
Where's the money?

01:43.560 --> 01:46.075
You took it.
- I didn't. Go away.

01:46.560 --> 01:51.191
Get away from me, you freak!
- Where's my money?

01:51.360 --> 01:53.113
I'll strangle you.

01:53.560 --> 01:56.792
Where's my money, you whore?
- Are you nuts?

01:57.040 --> 01:59.714
Where is it?
- Get your hands off me!

02:00.040 --> 02:03.954
Where's my money?
Where is it, you whore?

02:04.240 --> 02:07.392
Let go of her! Get away from her,
you bastard!

02:07.560 --> 02:10.394
Don't you dare touch her!
- Where's my money, you scum?

02:10.560 --> 02:12.756
Don't touch her!
- Bitch!

02:50.800 --> 02:53.360
THE FOOL

02:57.600 --> 02:59.398
...He's come back drunk.

03:03.120 --> 03:06.431
<i>Dilapidated walls, collapsed ceilings,</i>
<i>and pervasive mould:</i>

03:06.600 --> 03:08.717
<i>all realities of life for residents living</i>

03:08.880 --> 03:10.997
<i>right opposite the local</i>
<i>government building</i>

03:11.160 --> 03:14.949
<i>but it seems that the window in the</i>
<i>governor's office faces the other way.</i>

03:15.160 --> 03:18.790
<i>These wooden shacks were built</i>
<i>back in 1950 as temporary dwellings</i>

03:18.960 --> 03:21.031
<i>and have not been repaired since.</i>

03:21.200 --> 03:24.830
<i>Meanwhile, across the road,</i>
<i>a construction project is well under way</i>

03:25.000 --> 03:27.959
<i>not for a residential building,</i>
<i>but a two-story parking lot</i>

03:28.120 --> 03:29.839
<i>for local government officials...</i>

03:49.080 --> 03:51.151
Do you really think
you'll pass?

03:52.320 --> 03:53.720
What do you think?

03:55.360 --> 03:57.511
Everyone says you've got
to bribe someone.

03:59.720 --> 04:01.439
So don't listen.

04:03.760 --> 04:05.513
You're not a kid, Dima.

04:06.320 --> 04:08.357
It's worth a try at least.

04:08.720 --> 04:11.474
Or should I drop everything
and go borrow some money?

04:13.880 --> 04:15.678
Why do you need this anyway?

04:15.840 --> 04:18.833
Well, I could take over
Fedotov's position.

04:21.120 --> 04:23.510
You'd need to be buddies
with everyone,

04:23.680 --> 04:25.990
and to them you're just
some student.

04:26.280 --> 04:28.272
They'll say you're trying
to be smart.

04:30.080 --> 04:33.357
They certainly will.
Definitely.

04:41.720 --> 04:43.996
Masha, go set the table.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.200
One moment...

04:46.720 --> 04:49.155
Dima, watch Anton please.

04:59.840 --> 05:02.992
Dad, they're breaking
the bench again!

05:03.880 --> 05:06.076
Where are you going?
- Mom...

05:06.400 --> 05:09.313
They'll rip your heads off!
- Stop it already.

05:09.640 --> 05:11.233
Get out of the way!

05:12.240 --> 05:15.153
Dima, enough chasing after them.
What's the point?

05:15.360 --> 05:17.431
I'm tired of repairing that bench.

05:17.800 --> 05:19.951
We'll catch them this time for sure.

05:22.440 --> 05:24.432
Come on, let's go.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.120
Scram!

05:39.040 --> 05:40.952
What the hell are you doing,

05:41.120 --> 05:42.679
you bastards?
- Suck it!

06:00.840 --> 06:03.355
These punks need to get
their legs ripped off.

06:03.520 --> 06:04.636
You didn't catch them?

06:05.080 --> 06:07.151
I'll find out who
hangs out around here

06:07.320 --> 06:08.879
and go talk to their parents.

06:09.320 --> 06:12.711
What's the point?
They'll just tell you to go to hell.

06:13.360 --> 06:16.831
Let's go eat.
I'll fix it later.

06:33.520 --> 06:36.831
Not too fatty?
Have some bread with it.

06:38.080 --> 06:39.753
You'll get heartburn otherwise.

06:40.880 --> 06:43.395
Want some more?
- Let me finish what I have first.

06:43.640 --> 06:45.154
Is it cold?

06:45.760 --> 06:47.319
It's fine, relax.

06:47.600 --> 06:50.320
Come on, sweetheart, yum-yum.
You like yum-yum?

06:50.720 --> 06:54.760
"Yum-yum"... You give him candy,
then expect him to eat real food?

06:55.000 --> 06:57.231
Please don't start.
Come on, yum-yum.

06:57.440 --> 07:01.514
When he gets hungry at night,
you'll be the one heating things up.

07:02.640 --> 07:04.074
Come on, eat some.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.915
Well, did you catch them?

07:10.960 --> 07:13.839
Who can keep up with them?
They're like galloping horses.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.357
Give up on that bench already.
You've repaired it a hundred times.

07:17.520 --> 07:20.911
The neighbors are laughing at you.
- Instead of repairing it themselves.

07:21.080 --> 07:23.959
Freezing their asses sitting
on the cold ground isn't funny.

07:24.120 --> 07:26.919
Those gorillas will realize
their strength any day now

07:27.240 --> 07:30.392
and next time, they'll bash
your heads in.

07:30.960 --> 07:33.839
We'll call the cops then.
- You think the cops care?

07:34.040 --> 07:36.475
They didn't even do anything
to stop the fight.

07:38.080 --> 07:39.560
Dima...

07:40.440 --> 07:41.920
You know what I was thinking?

07:42.080 --> 07:44.072
Ivlev is selling his garage,
his cottage

07:44.240 --> 07:45.833
and his car for next to nothing.

07:46.040 --> 07:48.509
He's a useless drunk nowadays.

07:49.040 --> 07:50.713
You should take out a loan.

07:50.880 --> 07:53.600
My driver's license
might come in handy.

07:54.600 --> 07:58.116
Mom, I told you I need
to pay for the semester.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.000
You tell him.

08:03.520 --> 08:06.797
What am I supposed to tell him?
He's his own master.

08:08.640 --> 08:10.791
Two dupes in a pod, I swear.

08:11.920 --> 08:15.516
You will never get anywhere
in life like that. Never.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.958
This one has spent his entire life

08:18.120 --> 08:19.634
righteously thumping his chest.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.951
and now my son plans on doing
the same thing.

08:22.760 --> 08:26.356
Mom, I only have 2 years left.
Then we'll buy the garage.

08:26.720 --> 08:28.916
You all can live as you like.

08:29.640 --> 08:31.871
What's wrong?
- Nothing!

08:32.240 --> 08:33.799
Other people have everything,

08:33.960 --> 08:35.917
I'm ashamed to look them in the face.

08:36.200 --> 08:37.839
Even our health is poor.

08:38.159 --> 08:40.356
Dad has a bad back
and high blood pressure.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.876
And my legs can barely
get me to the kitchen.

08:45.800 --> 08:50.397
Ivan, did we really think that
fortune would smile on us?

08:51.880 --> 08:55.157
I spent twenty years slaving away
as a doctor in the hospital.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.756
and now I'm mopping floors
in my old office.

08:58.920 --> 08:59.990
But I have no choice.

09:00.400 --> 09:01.880
Try living on a pension!

09:02.040 --> 09:04.600
And your dad has
one foot in the grave.

09:04.920 --> 09:08.231
He's been breathing in ashes
on that crane for almost 30 years.

09:08.680 --> 09:10.956
His lungs are clogged,
he's coughing.

09:11.120 --> 09:14.272
We'll see what will come first -
disability, or...

09:14.520 --> 09:16.398
I'll take you both
to get treatment.

09:16.560 --> 09:18.597
What do I want with
your treatments?

09:18.920 --> 09:21.480
Did we get all these
ailments for nothing?

09:22.880 --> 09:24.917
We did it so that you could
become a man

09:25.080 --> 09:26.912
and live life as it should be lived.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.237
And for Anton.

09:31.440 --> 09:34.751
And I'm not a man?
- You're a fool!

09:43.040 --> 09:46.511
Leave them alone already.
He's sitting here, studying.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.439
What do you want from them?

09:48.600 --> 09:49.511
I'm his mother.

09:49.680 --> 09:51.478
You're the one who
never needs anything.

09:51.640 --> 09:53.757
The apple didn't fall far
from the tree.

09:54.880 --> 09:56.758
Here we go.
- Am I wrong?

09:56.920 --> 09:59.879
You just say, "We don't need what
doesn't belong to us".

10:00.040 --> 10:01.759
And nothing ever belongs to us!

10:02.040 --> 10:05.716
So here you are, all righteous,
but living in dirt your whole life.

10:07.960 --> 10:09.838
Enough already.
I've had it with you.

10:10.120 --> 10:12.032
Look at you sitting here
gathering dust.

10:12.200 --> 10:14.157
Everyone here is sick
and tired of you.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.716
That's right!
You especially!

10:21.560 --> 10:23.756
People stealing left and right,
but not me!

10:23.920 --> 10:26.196
Exactly! You never brought
anything home!

10:26.360 --> 10:28.591
The pipes are leaking,
and you don't give a shit.

10:28.760 --> 10:30.240
Even the Karasevs replaced theirs!

10:30.400 --> 10:31.800
He stole them from the warehouse!

10:31.960 --> 10:33.758
So drown here with
your righteousness!

10:34.000 --> 10:37.198
People take things for themselves!
Why don't you?

10:37.360 --> 10:39.511
So that no one can point
their finger at you?

10:39.680 --> 10:40.716
In the end, everyone does!

10:40.880 --> 10:42.155
They avoid you like a leper!

10:42.320 --> 10:44.471
Nobody wants anything
to do with you.

10:45.160 --> 10:47.959
You old fool.
- Find a young one.

10:50.440 --> 10:52.591
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

10:53.840 --> 10:56.071
Dad...
- Let him go!

11:00.680 --> 11:04.720
What's gotten into you?
- Oh, so I'm the one to blame?

11:05.280 --> 11:08.352
First you raise them, and then...
- I've had it with you.

11:25.880 --> 11:28.190
What's wrong with kids nowadays?

11:32.560 --> 11:34.472
Don't listen to her, Dad.

11:45.440 --> 11:50.151
I came to work once and saw
a bunch of guys acting shifty.

11:51.680 --> 11:54.070
"Come over here."
I said, "What for?"

11:54.720 --> 11:58.760
"We need to steal some pipes
from the warehouse".

12:00.000 --> 12:03.118
So I said,
"They don't belong to us".

12:05.240 --> 12:07.391
And now they avoid me
like the plague.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.233
Don't even say hello anymore.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.719
Your mother is right.

12:15.360 --> 12:19.400
I've lived sixty years and have
neither friends, nor enemies.

12:19.960 --> 12:21.917
Everyone considers me a fool.

12:24.800 --> 12:29.079
At work, it's because I work
and don't steal.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.800
Here it's because I replace
stolen light bulbs.

12:34.720 --> 12:39.078
and because I repair
the bench every evening.

12:41.120 --> 12:42.793
I am a fool.

12:44.520 --> 12:46.034
You're not a fool.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.634
Oh, come on...

12:52.800 --> 12:55.998
Dima! Somebody from dispatch
called for you.

12:56.280 --> 12:58.078
Mom, tell them
I'm off duty today.

12:58.360 --> 13:01.398
They say it's urgent.
Filimonov went on a bender.

13:03.040 --> 13:04.952
I should go.
- Sure.

13:22.600 --> 13:23.954
<i>Tell us what happened.</i>

13:24.120 --> 13:27.431
<i>What's there to tell?</i>
<i>The pipes are 20 years old.</i>

13:28.600 --> 13:30.751
<i>Good thing I wasn't</i>
<i>taking a shower,</i>

13:30.920 --> 13:32.877
<i>or I would've been boiled alive.</i>

13:33.280 --> 13:35.351
<i>I don't care about the pipes.</i>

13:35.520 --> 13:38.558
<i>Why the hell did</i>
<i>you beat your family?...</i>

13:39.080 --> 13:42.152
Andrey, did you shut it
off downstairs?

13:42.360 --> 13:45.114
What, and leave the whole
building without water?

13:45.280 --> 13:48.557
I'm just worried...
Look at how it burst.

13:49.640 --> 13:51.552
<i>... Come on, chief,</i>
<i>it's family matters.</i>

13:51.720 --> 13:53.120
<i>We'll sort it out ourselves.</i>

13:53.280 --> 13:55.840
<i>Yeah right, and next time</i>
<i>we'll come here</i>

13:56.000 --> 13:57.354
<i>to collect dead bodies?</i>

13:57.840 --> 14:00.594
Let's just wait for
the chief to get here,

14:00.760 --> 14:02.035
and let him decide.

14:04.200 --> 14:06.954
You drank yourself to insanity.
- Aha, right.

14:07.160 --> 14:08.594
Don't talk back.

14:09.760 --> 14:12.832
<i>tverything's fine,</i>
<i>it's family matters.</i>

14:13.360 --> 14:15.795
When did you drink last?
- Why?

14:16.120 --> 14:20.114
Because the shot won't work.
- I hope it won't.

14:20.880 --> 14:22.837
Let the bastard suffer.

14:23.200 --> 14:26.113
Our daughter's covered in blood.
- Shut up, bitch.

14:26.360 --> 14:28.158
Quiet, you.

14:28.800 --> 14:31.190
I haven't touched the
stuff in three days.

14:31.560 --> 14:34.314
The hangover wasn't easing up.
I went for my stash - it was gone.

14:34.560 --> 14:37.394
Almost had a heart attack.
Put yourself in my shoes.

14:37.640 --> 14:41.236
My liver's not big enough
to fill your shoes.

14:41.760 --> 14:45.197
Well, the burn isn't serious.
It's just a scald.

14:45.600 --> 14:48.160
I'll give you some ointment,
put it on at night.

14:49.040 --> 14:52.238
But if you drink,
the shot won't work.

14:52.400 --> 14:53.834
Just so you know.

14:55.760 --> 14:57.638
Do you want us to take him in?

15:05.480 --> 15:10.191
He has to be at work tomorrow.
Or he won't get his bonus again.

15:11.760 --> 15:13.558
Sign the waiver then.

15:42.440 --> 15:44.557
<i>Do we really need all this hassle?</i>

15:44.720 --> 15:46.996
<i>Why should we be</i>
<i>dealing with this?</i>

15:47.400 --> 15:49.198
What, you can't handle
a burst pipe?

15:49.360 --> 15:51.795
Should we turn
the water off in the basement?

15:52.120 --> 15:54.760
What the hell for?
- Take a look yourself.

15:55.760 --> 15:57.638
What, you felt sorry for me?

15:57.920 --> 15:59.354
I felt sorry for our girl.

15:59.520 --> 16:02.115
Her boots are falling apart.
She needs new ones.

16:02.440 --> 16:05.433
Her feet are always wet and cold,
she'll get sick.

16:13.800 --> 16:16.076
Well, are you gonna fix it or not?

16:16.240 --> 16:19.153
Shut up, or you're gonna
fix it yourself.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.991
Is this a bearing wall?
- You should know better.

16:26.800 --> 16:28.393
Fuck!

16:30.280 --> 16:31.350
What's with him?

16:31.800 --> 16:32.916
Let's go.

16:35.440 --> 16:37.591
<i>Get ready for bed.</i>

16:39.360 --> 16:42.671
<i>Mom, let's stay over at Lena's place.</i>
<i>I'm scared of him.</i>

16:43.200 --> 16:45.192
<i>Do what you're told.</i>

16:46.160 --> 16:49.676
<i>There are too many people</i>
<i>in their room as it is.</i>

16:50.280 --> 16:52.511
<i>Go to bed, it's 10pm already.</i>

16:56.400 --> 16:58.551
<i>Well, are we gonna sleep or not?</i>

16:58.880 --> 17:03.193
<i>I'm not going to bed with you.</i>
<i>Go sleep on the sofa.</i>

17:03.680 --> 17:07.195
<i>Oh come on.</i>
<i>- Hands off me.</i>

18:47.520 --> 18:49.079
Come here.

18:52.160 --> 18:53.640
What happened?

18:54.600 --> 18:57.069
Have there been any other
complaints from the tenants?

18:57.280 --> 19:00.114
Not today, but this place is
a pain in the ass.

19:00.360 --> 19:02.920
It's an old building.
Been standing for 40 years.

19:03.720 --> 19:08.192
Why are you so agitated?
- Shit... This isn't my district.

19:08.840 --> 19:11.435
Has there been a thorough
overhaul of this building?

19:13.280 --> 19:16.318
What overhaul?
Like you don't know Fedotov.

19:16.560 --> 19:19.553
They painted the walls,
and he pocketed the rest.

19:20.080 --> 19:24.279
What about inspections?
Was everything in order?

19:24.720 --> 19:26.154
Are you joking?

19:26.320 --> 19:29.233
The inspectors were given cash
to shut up - problem solved.

19:29.520 --> 19:31.034
Time's up for this building.

19:31.200 --> 19:33.669
We're tired of always having
to come out here.

19:33.920 --> 19:36.515
The roof leaks,
the pipes are rusty.

19:36.680 --> 19:39.832
We patch a hole, and six new
ones appear the next day.

19:40.080 --> 19:41.070
What about Filimonov?

19:41.240 --> 19:42.720
Has he talked to
Fedotov about this?

19:42.960 --> 19:43.916
Why would he care?

19:44.080 --> 19:45.992
His wife left him,
so he's been drunk

19:46.160 --> 19:47.196
for 3 days straight.

19:48.840 --> 19:51.639
You'll probably be
transferred to our crew.

19:51.800 --> 19:54.031
The most problematic neighborhood.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.514
What's wrong, anyway?

19:57.440 --> 19:58.874
Hell knows.

19:59.600 --> 20:01.557
I think the foundation is shifting.

20:02.120 --> 20:03.349
Are you serious?

20:03.880 --> 20:07.271
There's a crack on the outside
from the first to the ninth floor.

20:07.680 --> 20:10.115
I looked around, it's a
through-wall crack.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.910
And the entire building's tilting.

20:14.800 --> 20:16.917
Fucking hell...

20:18.760 --> 20:21.275
What do we do now?
- Quiet, calm down.

20:23.520 --> 20:25.876
Just shut off the water for now
and go home.

20:26.040 --> 20:29.716
I'll go talk to Fedotov tomorrow.
That's all. Bye

22:22.520 --> 22:25.319
Dima, what are you doing?

22:26.120 --> 22:28.396
Go to sleep.
- I need to check something.

22:29.640 --> 22:32.872
You and your damn school.
You've got exams tomorrow?

22:33.360 --> 22:35.636
Close your eyes, Anton.

22:45.640 --> 22:48.360
Dima, are you nuts?
What are you doing?

22:49.040 --> 22:51.635
Where are you going?
- I don't know why he got up.

22:51.840 --> 22:53.718
I'm going to the 32nd dormitory.

22:54.040 --> 22:57.920
Where I was today. Got it?
- No. What are you talking about?

22:58.560 --> 23:02.315
The dormitory, remember?
- I guess. So what?

23:02.480 --> 23:05.552
Things are pretty bad there.
The building's barely standing.

23:05.720 --> 23:08.360
There's a crack, the building's tilting.
It's going to collapse.

23:08.520 --> 23:09.954
Are you joking?
- I'm serious.

23:10.120 --> 23:12.077
I just looked
at the stability calculations

23:12.240 --> 23:13.594
for a 9-story panel building.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.993
It's won't stand another 24 hours.
- Bite your tongue.

23:17.520 --> 23:19.079
So, go see Fedotov tomorrow.

23:19.280 --> 23:21.875
The foundation is crumbling.
We need to evacuate people now!

23:22.040 --> 23:24.999
And who's going to let you do that
without an inspection, you lunatic?

23:25.160 --> 23:27.277
Some people have been
there for 30 years.

23:27.440 --> 23:29.830
You want them out
in the middle of the night?

23:30.000 --> 23:31.878
It has to be done right now!

23:32.240 --> 23:36.029
But how? Do you have
Fedotov's number? Call him.

23:36.320 --> 23:39.358
He won't do anything.
He pocketed the overhaul money.

23:39.600 --> 23:42.832
Do you know anyone from the
administration?

23:43.680 --> 23:45.831
Your mother does.
- Whom?

23:46.120 --> 23:48.510
Razumikhina, the chief accountant
at the mayor's office,

23:48.680 --> 23:49.591
is your friend, right?

23:49.760 --> 23:51.319
We haven't seen each other in ages.

23:51.520 --> 23:54.592
I'm not going to bother her at this hour
with this nonsense.

23:54.800 --> 23:58.316
It's not nonsense, Mom!
People can die at any minute! Call her!

23:58.800 --> 24:00.917
Don't yell
- I said, call her!

24:05.520 --> 24:08.592
Here's her number, call her yourself,
you raving lunatic!

24:12.080 --> 24:14.515
Is it that serious?
- It's very serious.

24:14.680 --> 24:16.637
Don't you know that
you won't get anywhere?

24:16.800 --> 24:18.951
If they didn't care about
that building for 30 years,

24:19.120 --> 24:20.156
why would they start now?

24:20.320 --> 24:24.109
Yes, I know everything.
- You will raise a panic, and then what?

24:25.080 --> 24:27.993
People will have to be put up
somewhere for the night.

24:28.160 --> 24:29.355
They can't be on the street

24:29.520 --> 24:31.512
with their children
and suitcases in the cold.

24:31.680 --> 24:32.955
They will have to be resettled,

24:33.120 --> 24:34.759
and you know what
our town hall's like.

24:34.920 --> 24:35.990
A bunch of thieving rats.

24:36.160 --> 24:37.196
Complaints will come in,

24:37.360 --> 24:39.750
people will be fired and courts
will get involved.

24:39.920 --> 24:40.797
Stay out of it.

24:40.960 --> 24:43.794
What are they going to do, kill me?
- Idiot.

24:44.160 --> 24:46.720
Calm down. Go put Anton to bed.

24:47.200 --> 24:52.229
Hello, Galya? It's Dmitry Nikitin.
I apologize for calling so late.

24:53.120 --> 24:57.592
Galya, I really need your help
to contact someone.

24:59.640 --> 25:01.393
The mayor.

25:02.280 --> 25:03.919
Yes, with Galaganova.

25:04.400 --> 25:09.077
No, no, not during
office hours, no...

25:09.720 --> 25:12.235
Yes, it's urgent,
and no, I'm not joking.

25:14.560 --> 25:16.119
Really?

25:17.480 --> 25:18.800
Where?

25:22.680 --> 25:23.636
Got it.

25:24.320 --> 25:26.277
I'll be right there. Yes.

25:26.720 --> 25:27.756
What did she say?

25:27.920 --> 25:29.639
The entire administration is celebrating

25:29.800 --> 25:31.439
Galaganova's birthday
in a restaurant.

25:31.600 --> 25:33.751
There's my meeting -
couldn't be better.

25:34.720 --> 25:38.760
They're all drunk right now...
- Maybe they're better drunk.

25:38.960 --> 25:40.280
They'll be more kind.

25:40.600 --> 25:41.750
We'll see.

25:42.280 --> 25:43.475
Are you sure?

25:48.480 --> 25:49.800
Wait for me.

25:50.880 --> 25:54.590
Oh good Lord, what a mess...

25:56.080 --> 25:57.275
Oh God...

25:57.760 --> 26:01.470
Go put the kettle on.
- Oh God... Alright.

29:02.760 --> 29:05.036
Hey, careful, bro.
- You could step aside.

29:05.280 --> 29:07.670
I could do anything.
- I'm happy for you.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.152
Hey, let's get introduced.
- Later.

29:23.040 --> 29:25.839
Easy...
Is it that bad?

29:26.120 --> 29:28.589
The vodka's bad.
- Get some food in your stomach.

29:28.760 --> 29:30.991
Excuse me, where can
I find Nina Galaganova?

29:31.160 --> 29:32.514
She's in the dining hall.

29:32.840 --> 29:35.753
Thank you.
- Only she's married

29:36.960 --> 29:39.555
Good to know.
- But I'm not.

29:42.240 --> 29:44.436
Where are you going?
- Where I need to go

29:44.640 --> 29:47.200
To see her again?
- Go drink some more.

29:47.560 --> 29:50.712
I'll divorce you, you bastard!

29:51.120 --> 29:53.271
It's about time.
Been waiting for 3 years.

30:06.920 --> 30:08.593
Let's dance!

30:28.160 --> 30:30.391
Come on, girls!

30:59.280 --> 31:02.717
Dear friends!
May I have your attention please?

31:06.360 --> 31:09.717
I think we shouldn't
just raise our glasses

31:09.880 --> 31:12.270
to the health of our dear Nina

31:12.520 --> 31:15.957
but also say the most
important things about her!

31:20.040 --> 31:22.555
We've all wished her
good health, a long life,

31:22.720 --> 31:24.074
happy friends and family.

31:24.280 --> 31:25.396
But most importantly,

31:25.560 --> 31:28.553
we all owe her a debt of
gratitude for our thriving town

31:28.840 --> 31:31.719
that grows and gets more
beautiful every year.

31:35.680 --> 31:41.597
The life that every resident enjoys
is entirely thanks to her.

31:41.840 --> 31:45.880
I ask the people closest
to Nina to say a few words

31:46.040 --> 31:48.600
of gratitude on this fine evening.

31:54.680 --> 31:58.913
I came here about 20 years ago.

32:00.000 --> 32:03.232
I had to get the zoning documents
for the factory.

32:04.680 --> 32:08.151
So I walk into the records
office and see.

32:08.440 --> 32:14.550
a skinny girl in a dress that blends
into the filing cabinets.

32:14.960 --> 32:17.873
I ask her to bring me this,
give me that,

32:18.040 --> 32:20.714
but she acts like
she doesn't see me.

32:22.280 --> 32:25.956
I bark out an order -
and she tells me to go to hell.

32:26.320 --> 32:30.678
So then I look at her and say:

32:31.280 --> 32:33.397
"You're going to be
a big boss one day".

32:33.760 --> 32:37.720
That girl's name was Nina.

32:43.120 --> 32:47.512
Nina was from a small village.

32:47.920 --> 32:50.640
Her mother had six children,

32:50.800 --> 32:55.431
a cow and her husband's grave
in the backyard.

32:56.080 --> 33:01.792
This place was a real
pigsty twenty years ago.

33:03.280 --> 33:05.840
Unless you held your nose
and closed your eyes

33:06.000 --> 33:08.879
walking down the street,
you'd be driven to drink.

33:09.320 --> 33:12.279
This was one big shithole.

33:13.760 --> 33:17.151
But now,
twenty years have passed.

33:18.400 --> 33:21.632
I'm thinking of buying a house
somewhere on the outskirts.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.596
and moving there with my family
when I get old.

33:26.480 --> 33:30.030
And all thanks to you, Nina.
You're the boss.

33:31.640 --> 33:34.997
And others even call you
by a different name.

33:35.360 --> 33:38.194
Don't be shy, come on,
all together now!

33:38.600 --> 33:41.069
Mama!
Mama!

34:16.760 --> 34:19.514
Nina, this is Dmitry Nikitin,
a repair crew chief

34:19.679 --> 34:21.319
for the public utility works.

34:21.600 --> 34:22.670
Hello.
- Hello.

34:22.920 --> 34:24.672
I'm here on a work-related issue.

34:24.840 --> 34:26.877
Now? I'm celebrating.
Have a drink.

34:27.159 --> 34:29.436
Really, I can't.
It's an urgent matter.

34:29.600 --> 34:31.080
Have a drink, busy man.

34:33.960 --> 34:35.518
Do you know each other?

34:35.679 --> 34:38.639
No. He doesn't like
to do introductions.

34:39.280 --> 34:41.158
I'm Dmitry Nikitin.

34:42.440 --> 34:45.831
Nina, an incident has occurred.
- What incident?

34:46.560 --> 34:49.996
An emergency situation at one
of the 'A' district dormitories.

34:51.040 --> 34:53.714
Can't Fedotov or his assistants
handle this?

34:53.920 --> 34:57.994
I'm afraid he won't care,
because he never has before.

34:58.320 --> 35:00.437
This case could end
with many deaths

35:00.600 --> 35:01.954
in the next few hours.

35:02.400 --> 35:05.199
Please get all the department
heads together,

35:05.360 --> 35:07.113
firemen, police, ambulances.

35:07.280 --> 35:08.634
We need a plan of action.

35:08.800 --> 35:11.235
I will give a detailed account
of the situation.

35:14.960 --> 35:17.270
Mrs. Galaganova,
I understand that

35:17.440 --> 35:19.113
this is a party and all.

35:19.520 --> 35:23.309
But something terrible is
about to happen.

35:28.240 --> 35:29.879
I'm not joking.

35:34.080 --> 35:35.878
Emelyanov!

35:39.040 --> 35:41.760
Get all the chiefs together
in the other hall.

35:41.920 --> 35:43.798
Who exactly do you need,
Nina?

35:44.800 --> 35:48.874
They're all wasted.
Sayapin left already, blind drunk.

35:49.600 --> 35:52.320
And Tulsky's wife took
him home...

35:52.480 --> 35:55.712
Call them and tell them
to come back.

35:56.680 --> 35:59.115
I don't care if they puke
or take pills;

35:59.280 --> 36:00.600
they have to be here.

36:12.080 --> 36:17.030
Watch out, Dmitry Nikitin,
repair crew chief.

36:59.680 --> 37:00.909
Thanks.

37:15.840 --> 37:17.593
What are you stirring
shit up for?

37:17.920 --> 37:19.639
Sit down, Fedor.

37:31.640 --> 37:35.236
Well, go ahead and inform us.

37:48.360 --> 37:52.877
A crew was called to the 32nd
dormitory in district A,

37:53.040 --> 37:55.999
to repair a burst hot-water pipe.

37:56.280 --> 37:59.079
They saw that things
were bad and called me.

37:59.240 --> 38:02.119
Why not Filimonov?
He's the chief engineer.

38:04.720 --> 38:08.509
He went on a bender, Fedor.
It's been three days.

38:13.040 --> 38:17.353
The pipes burst due to the
displacement of bearing walls.

38:17.760 --> 38:18.910
The dormitory was built

38:19.080 --> 38:20.878
even before the town
was founded.

38:21.240 --> 38:25.598
So that was about
40 years ago... - 38.

38:27.440 --> 38:28.760
Whatever.

38:29.200 --> 38:31.078
A major overhaul
was never done...

38:31.360 --> 38:32.396
What do you mean?

38:32.560 --> 38:35.758
There was one in 1984,
and another three years ago.

38:35.920 --> 38:38.276
I'm not prepared to argue
about the quality

38:38.440 --> 38:39.920
of these repairs right now.

38:40.160 --> 38:42.038
The concern here is
that the building

38:42.200 --> 38:43.714
could collapse at any minute.

38:47.360 --> 38:51.240
Who gave you this idea?
Like this very minute?

38:51.720 --> 38:55.191
Yes. Practically as we speak.

38:55.600 --> 38:58.115
There are two huge cracks
on the bearing walls,

38:58.280 --> 38:59.919
from the first to the ninth floor.

39:00.080 --> 39:01.719
And the entire building's tilting.

39:01.880 --> 39:03.951
The foundation is crumbling
and shifting.

39:04.360 --> 39:07.876
The vibrations of the units are
visible to the naked eye.

39:09.480 --> 39:12.996
How many people live there?
- Who are you listening to, Tolya?

39:13.920 --> 39:18.039
This requires a regional inspection,
about 10 specialists.

39:18.200 --> 39:19.714
There are many aspects.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.756
He just probably fucking
some girl

39:22.920 --> 39:26.277
in that dorm and promised her
a new apartment.

39:26.760 --> 39:29.036
It's 2 am, Fedor...
- Shut up!

39:29.360 --> 39:33.593
That sounds about right.
Balls rolled up - now pay up.

39:34.160 --> 39:36.994
Go and look for yourselves.
Even a child can see...

39:37.200 --> 39:39.795
Maybe a child can, but
it's not clear to us.

39:41.680 --> 39:45.640
Are you the chief
housing engineer? - No.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.231
Exactly.
- Neither are you!

39:56.320 --> 39:57.470
Foundation, tilt -

39:57.640 --> 39:59.359
do you know
much about that?

39:59.520 --> 40:01.751
Yes, I'm studying construction,
second year.

40:01.920 --> 40:03.991
Need the diploma
to get promoted, right?

40:04.320 --> 40:06.516
I told you to be quiet!

40:08.080 --> 40:10.879
You can really see everything
with the naked eye.

40:11.080 --> 40:13.640
The stability factor of
a nine-story panel building

40:13.800 --> 40:15.917
doesn't allow for a
tilt of even 5 degrees.

40:16.080 --> 40:18.640
and that building is leaning
by around 10 degrees.

40:19.080 --> 40:22.710
The tilt is beyond the point
of maximum deviation

40:22.880 --> 40:25.873
from the gravity-bearing
perpendicular.

40:26.440 --> 40:30.195
This means that
the building is falling,

40:30.360 --> 40:33.432
and it will fall no matter what.

40:34.080 --> 40:37.357
Taking into account
the angle of deviation,

40:37.520 --> 40:40.752
the building won't stand
more than a day.

41:09.800 --> 41:12.360
Do you realize that in that case

41:12.640 --> 41:14.518
we need to declare an emergency

41:14.680 --> 41:16.911
and evacuate
the people immediately?

41:17.640 --> 41:18.596
Yes.

41:19.960 --> 41:21.872
How many are in there?
A thousand?

41:22.040 --> 41:23.360
There are 820 people.

41:24.560 --> 41:26.279
820 people.

41:28.560 --> 41:30.597
They will need to be resettled.

41:31.320 --> 41:33.676
And the town has a
housing shortage as it is.

41:34.080 --> 41:36.197
Go ahead,
call a regional inspection,

41:36.360 --> 41:39.114
let them check everything
and make a decision.

41:39.400 --> 41:41.756
Because I'm not taking
on these costs.

41:41.920 --> 41:44.071
You want to end up
in jail then?

41:45.080 --> 41:48.835
Sayapin can take care of that
as our friend.

41:54.120 --> 41:55.031
800 people.

41:55.200 --> 41:57.635
What if they all
get buried under there?

41:59.120 --> 42:00.952
You pocketed the money
for repairs,

42:01.120 --> 42:03.191
I never checked.
We're both going down.

42:03.480 --> 42:06.154
I pocketed the money?
- You did!

42:06.480 --> 42:08.278
Oh come on, Fedor!

42:08.640 --> 42:13.078
Did your daughter's
house build itself?

42:14.600 --> 42:16.637
Or did you help her
with your salary?

42:16.800 --> 42:17.836
Look who's talking!

42:18.040 --> 42:20.635
What about your house?
Or his house?

42:21.040 --> 42:25.751
Why don't we tell this kid here
who pocketed what.

42:26.120 --> 42:30.160
Or how we survive around here,
washing each other's hands.

42:30.640 --> 42:33.758
What hands?
Watch what you say!

42:34.160 --> 42:36.311
I've got my own patch.
- What patch?

42:36.480 --> 42:39.552
The whole town together with its
30,000 residents is the patch.

42:39.760 --> 42:40.750
One of us gets caught,

42:40.920 --> 42:42.752
he'll take everyone down
with him.

42:42.920 --> 42:45.640
Journalists will come,
and up in smoke we go.

42:45.920 --> 42:48.435
I'm all clean.
I've had inspections already.

42:48.640 --> 42:50.871
Crime detection rate
was within norm.

42:51.040 --> 42:53.509
No drug addicts,
no prostitutes at all.

42:55.760 --> 42:57.797
But you and Matyugin
will be going up

42:57.960 --> 42:59.394
in smoke in his fire truck.

42:59.600 --> 43:01.478
Any more threats?

43:01.720 --> 43:04.030
What did you do
with the prostitutes?

43:04.200 --> 43:05.634
Are they at your harem?

43:06.640 --> 43:08.472
Quiet, all of you!

43:14.160 --> 43:16.231
A fish rots from the head down.

43:16.400 --> 43:19.074
If I'm tainted,
then so are all of you.

43:19.800 --> 43:22.474
They'll go through everything
with a fine-tooth comb.

43:22.640 --> 43:23.596
And for 800 people,

43:23.760 --> 43:25.797
they'll find shit
even in your "patch".

43:26.160 --> 43:28.516
What, do you have
the cleanest department?

43:38.160 --> 43:40.629
Right, go to the place with him.

43:41.520 --> 43:45.230
I'm...
- Have a look once you're there.

43:52.600 --> 43:54.796
If everything is as he says,

43:54.960 --> 43:57.759
then we'll think about
what to do.

44:02.560 --> 44:04.950
Let's go, shit-stirrer.

44:09.360 --> 44:11.033
Dima, stay for a moment.

44:16.680 --> 44:20.037
If he tries to threaten you,
don't listen.

44:20.200 --> 44:21.919
He's cunning and sly.

44:22.400 --> 44:25.199
If not him, then
we'll have to deal with it.

44:25.360 --> 44:27.477
Not to mention
those poor people.

44:34.440 --> 44:36.477
I'll go too. Fedotov's
angry right now,

44:36.640 --> 44:37.676
and the kid's naive.

44:38.040 --> 44:39.997
OK, good luck.

45:29.600 --> 45:32.240
Show us what you've got.
- It's this way.

45:38.960 --> 45:41.316
Here it is.
- What is it?

45:42.800 --> 45:45.315
The crack goes through
the whole building.

45:45.640 --> 45:48.439
So what? I saw this crack
two years ago.

45:49.880 --> 45:51.109
Fine.

45:52.440 --> 45:53.874
Look here.

45:57.680 --> 46:00.240
The wall is crumbling,
the foundation is shifting.

46:00.760 --> 46:02.558
Shifting where?

46:04.800 --> 46:07.679
In fall the soil gives
a little from the rain.

46:07.840 --> 46:09.399
Don't get smart, builder.

46:15.120 --> 46:17.476
OK, come with me.

46:21.280 --> 46:22.999
Come on, let's go.

46:46.400 --> 46:47.959
Man, it stinks in here.

46:48.240 --> 46:51.039
Fix the sewage pipes,
then it won't stink.

47:04.800 --> 47:06.871
You scum!
Stop torturing us!

47:07.200 --> 47:10.193
Your child is scared of you!
I'll call the cops.

47:10.520 --> 47:13.752
Go ahead, you piece of shit!
You think they'll show up?

47:13.920 --> 47:16.310
I'll cut you up, you bitch!
- Calm down, man.

47:16.480 --> 47:17.391
What did you say?

47:17.560 --> 47:19.677
Nothing, but you're asking
for a kicking.

47:20.880 --> 47:23.554
All right guys, no offence.

47:23.960 --> 47:25.599
My daughter steals
money from me,

47:25.760 --> 47:27.160
I need it for my treatment.

47:27.440 --> 47:29.511
The bitch buys smack with it.

47:33.120 --> 47:34.759
I'll go have a smoke.

47:40.520 --> 47:44.230
These people need their
brains repaired, not the pipes.

47:44.960 --> 47:46.952
That's why it stinks here.

47:48.560 --> 47:50.358
Different people live here.

47:51.760 --> 47:53.319
Go away.

47:53.720 --> 47:57.191
We're from the housing department.
I've got the chiefs here with me.

48:13.440 --> 48:15.909
Hello, Fedor.

48:18.760 --> 48:20.877
Can we take a look at your bathroom?

48:25.680 --> 48:27.239
Sure, sure, go ahead.

48:36.040 --> 48:37.918
It's one thing after another.

48:38.200 --> 48:41.318
Pipes burst, and then this
son of a bitch goes crazy.

48:41.600 --> 48:44.434
That scum beats his own daughter,
can you imagine?

48:46.000 --> 48:49.198
He needs to be taken away,
but the pigs,

48:49.360 --> 48:51.317
sorry, police, never do.

48:52.160 --> 48:54.834
Although, I let them go myself.

48:56.520 --> 48:57.795
Help us.

48:59.520 --> 49:00.954
With what?

49:01.480 --> 49:03.915
Sure, we'll deal with it.

49:08.000 --> 49:09.639
Will they fix the pipes soon?

49:09.960 --> 49:13.590
They shut the water off and we
can't wash or cook anything.

49:13.840 --> 49:15.354
Soon, soon.

50:07.560 --> 50:09.995
Go home.
- Yes sir!

50:10.760 --> 50:13.195
What did you say?
- Don't get involved.

50:13.360 --> 50:14.476
They're all punks.

50:20.560 --> 50:22.995
Look, the old bat is
going to crawl out.

50:23.480 --> 50:25.915
We're from the housing department.
May we come in?

50:26.720 --> 50:28.837
Get out of there, you punks!

50:29.080 --> 50:31.754
Chill out, granny. Come over here,
we'll get you stoned.

51:19.040 --> 51:20.759
They're all yours.

51:21.440 --> 51:23.272
I'm off for a piss.

51:34.600 --> 51:37.479
Oh, hi guys.
What are you doing here?

51:37.640 --> 51:40.394
We're from the housing department.
Checking the pipes.

51:40.720 --> 51:44.794
I don't give a fuck about the pipes.
I only shower once a week.

51:45.200 --> 51:47.112
There's plenty of water right now.

51:47.520 --> 51:51.878
I bring in snow from outside,
and problem solved.

51:52.360 --> 51:57.879
And if the building collapses,
I don't give a fuck as well.

51:59.040 --> 52:02.397
This is no life anyway, is it?

52:06.240 --> 52:11.031
Hey guys, how about
a shot or two, huh?

52:12.400 --> 52:16.519
Well? Come on!
Let's have some.

52:16.960 --> 52:18.599
Right...

52:19.880 --> 52:21.872
Let's get going.

52:25.520 --> 52:26.715
One more game?

52:26.960 --> 52:28.599
What did they want?
- Fuck knows...

52:28.800 --> 52:30.234
Hey...

52:32.320 --> 52:35.358
What are the chiefs doing here?
Something serious?

52:35.720 --> 52:37.871
We don't know yet.
- Listen...

52:38.520 --> 52:40.000
Trouble sleeping?

52:40.880 --> 52:42.758
What?
- It's late.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.913
Why do you even care
about us lowlives?

52:47.120 --> 52:50.511
Compassionate, are you?
- I am what I am.

53:12.160 --> 53:14.675
What were you doing there?
- Fuck off.

53:15.720 --> 53:18.474
That's some building...
- No kidding.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.878
Well?
- This way.

53:37.400 --> 53:40.120
What's the bottle for?
- Look.

54:14.240 --> 54:15.640
Come here.

54:30.480 --> 54:33.552
Look down.
Just be careful.

54:51.840 --> 54:54.833
Far from the wall?
- About three meters.

55:55.920 --> 55:59.152
Did you give everyone their tasks?
- Yes.

56:02.320 --> 56:05.154
Nina, what should I do
about the guests?

56:05.960 --> 56:07.633
Entertain them.

56:08.280 --> 56:10.397
Turn up the music.

56:11.280 --> 56:14.034
Tell the kitchen to hurry up
with the main course.

56:14.320 --> 56:15.834
Many are getting ready to leave.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.071
Vostrikov is upset that
you're not there.

56:18.400 --> 56:20.437
Well, make sure that he isn't upset.

56:20.600 --> 56:23.160
I can't be there.
I've got other things on my mind.

56:23.320 --> 56:26.199
Maybe we should let them go home?
- Yeah right!

56:27.440 --> 56:30.080
So they'd know we have a mess
on our hands?

56:30.960 --> 56:33.794
Give them enough booze
to put them to sleep.

56:34.560 --> 56:37.519
Tell them I had to leave,
but will be back shortly.

56:37.760 --> 56:38.876
Got it.

56:46.000 --> 56:47.992
The rumors will spread.

56:48.760 --> 56:52.071
The neighbors won't keep quiet.
They'll get more from the budget.

56:52.240 --> 56:55.472
The most important thing is that
the building does not collapse.

56:55.640 --> 56:58.075
Then there'll be facts, not rumors.

57:03.280 --> 57:04.350
Well?

57:05.960 --> 57:07.314
Speak!

57:08.000 --> 57:09.673
It's not good.

57:10.280 --> 57:12.078
It will probably collapse.

57:14.160 --> 57:15.480
Really?

57:16.240 --> 57:18.914
Don't know. Looks
like Nikitin was right.

57:19.920 --> 57:22.435
We need to get the people
out of there.

57:28.440 --> 57:35.870
I told you we needed to be careful
with district A.

57:37.280 --> 57:41.832
It was built in a rush,
on unstable soil.

57:42.880 --> 57:46.396
We should've resettled everyone and
demolished the building ages ago.

57:46.760 --> 57:49.070
Resettle them where, smart guy?

57:50.160 --> 57:52.959
Give me two buildings with
a hundred units each.

57:53.120 --> 57:56.557
We should have built them
when we had the money.

57:57.440 --> 57:59.272
But you were too greedy!

58:01.240 --> 58:03.436
Get out!
Get out!

58:08.880 --> 58:11.634
Half the budget goes up
to grease the palms

58:11.800 --> 58:13.280
at the regional office!

58:13.600 --> 58:16.479
Everyone there practically
lives at resorts!

58:16.640 --> 58:19.280
They all have cars, houses,
wives all decked in gold.

58:19.440 --> 58:22.035
And if I refuse - they won't
give us a penny.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.151
How much money did
we get this year?

58:30.480 --> 58:33.552
Just enough to tar a few roofs
and replace a few main pipes.

58:33.880 --> 58:37.920
Pensioners are going hungry,
three suicides a year.

58:38.080 --> 58:40.720
The disabled are waiting
to get treated by the state.

58:40.880 --> 58:43.918
What about orphanages,
and large family allowances?

58:44.640 --> 58:46.233
I built a new maternity hospital!

58:46.400 --> 58:47.959
Do you think I'm made
of money?

58:48.200 --> 58:51.113
And how am I supposed
to survive and raise my children?

58:52.840 --> 58:54.320
I'm constantly under stress.

58:54.480 --> 58:56.915
I lived in fear for
my life through the '90s.

58:57.120 --> 58:58.998
I'm responsible for everything:

58:59.160 --> 59:02.312
for taxes, for military enlistment,
for elections.

59:02.480 --> 59:05.314
They'll either send me to prison,
or pat me on the head.

59:07.400 --> 59:09.312
I want to live like a normal person!

59:09.480 --> 59:10.755
I have 3 scars on my head,

59:10.920 --> 59:12.912
hypertension,
ulcers and two divorces!

59:13.080 --> 59:17.120
I'm a woman, mother and wife -
I want to live like a normal person!

59:30.320 --> 59:31.959
And so do you.

59:34.520 --> 59:36.751
That's why you grab
a piece for yourself

59:36.920 --> 59:38.479
without a thought for others.

59:38.800 --> 59:41.838
You don't give a fuck whose
walls are crumbling

59:42.000 --> 59:43.639
or whose roof is leaking.

59:44.200 --> 59:47.398
Because you have to finish
laying down your own roof.

59:47.720 --> 59:52.636
Your house isn't much smaller
than mine, four stories tall.

59:53.480 --> 59:56.393
Your son, a spoiled brat,
rapist and drug addict

59:56.560 --> 59:58.597
with 6 arrests and 2 court cases.

59:58.800 --> 01:00:02.396
has an apartment in Moscow
and goes to a private school.

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:10.475
This one will soon have people
dying from simple infections,

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:13.109
while he steals all the supplies,
down to the antiseptics.

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:15.158
I bought new equipment
for the hospital,

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:16.197
he sold half of it.

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:17.476
If I wasn't helping,

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:20.235
you'd be treating people
with roadside herbs.

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:25.351
And this one has turned the
police department into a racket.

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:28.110
I looked the other way,
"Go ahead, Sergey.

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:29.236
Make some money".

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:33.000
I don't even know what you do.

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:35.277
Sit on your ass all day,
signing papers.

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:39.595
There hasn't been a fire
in the town for ten years.

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:43.439
but we still allocate
funds to get hoses,

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.796
equipment,
who knows what else!

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.595
Yeah, I make something
out of every deal.

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:02.551
But whose hands are clean here?

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:07.957
Perhaps one of you would like
to take my place? Be my guest!

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:17.354
Only you oafs won't be
able to hack it.

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:20.759
Sucking that teat dry,

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:24.118
but when something happens -
blame "mama".

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:29.197
And you call yourselves men?
Pussies.

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:30.271
Enough, Nina!

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:33.877
We all know that.
We weren't born yesterday.

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:39.114
I've always lived well,
never had to beg,

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:41.192
and don't plan on starting.

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:45.196
And I don't give a shit
what people think of me.

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:51.319
If you can't take what you need,
you'll live like a worm in shit.

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.679
This never-ending talk
about "corruption" -

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:58.196
the whole country lives on bribes!

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:10.997
Even in the Soviet days, when
my mother was dying of cancer

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:14.432
we had to grease some palms
to get her medication.

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:17.235
And now, you can't do anything
without money!

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:21.797
I hate to interrupt such nice
bureaucratic confessions,

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:25.870
but what are we going to do now?
Time's ticking.

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.437
What are we going to do?

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:35.594
Evacuate the people.

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:37.632
Is this official?
- Of course.

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:40.480
I'll call the regional office
and let them know.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:42.354
Why?

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:44.120
Regulations.

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:46.796
Let's not raise a stink right now.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.276
Get the people out,
and tomorrow we'll bring in

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:50.715
the experts and equipment.

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:52.519
Maybe it can still be repaired.

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:56.196
And who will be responsible for
the fuckups? Me or him?

01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:59.797
And what should we tell the tenants?
They're not a flock of sheep.

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:02.429
If they realize
that the building is failing,

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:03.636
they won't go back.

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:13.673
Well, then stage a fire,
or any emergency situation.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.072
Anything. We need to keep them
all out overnight.

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:20.876
And in the morning,
the experts will come.

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:23.271
If there are really no other options...

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:25.712
We'll have to resettle everyone.

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:29.791
I'll fall at Safronov's feet.
He's building an entire block.

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:45.276
Come on, go already!
Do something!

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:11.550
We found all the documents.
They're in the car.

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:14.838
If we need to, we can lose them.
- And what do you have?

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:17.113
Things are in pretty bad shape.

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:20.239
The deficit in the repairs budget
is 120 million.

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:22.074
Oh God...

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.312
We certainly could have spent it...

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:27.552
but what do we have to show for it?
That's a lot of money.

01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:30.590
A new construction site
could justify it,

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:33.195
but Safronov's investors
won't cooperate.

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:38.840
How much would it cost
to resettle the dormitory?

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.117
There are 820 residents.

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:44.791
An emergency means resettling
all of them, and fast.

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:48.955
At least 600 in the first two months.
That's about 200 families.

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.237
83 of those are multi-child families,

01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:53.551
there are 27 disabled,
and 10 veterans.

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:55.791
So we'll need about
60 two-room apartments,

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:57.280
and the rest are one-room.

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:01.917
I think that amounts
to approximately...

01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:05.518
...260 million

01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:10.477
God damn it...

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:14.353
Oh God...

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:19.395
I'm such an idiot...

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:23.475
Right...

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.119
Tanya, bring Safronov. Is he here?
- He left about two hours ago.

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:31.360
Then I need to go find him
- Wait, Nina.

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:32.875
There's no time.

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:36.477
If you have something
to say, come with me.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.071
Go and get another unit there!

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:56.959
So wake them up!
The gas workers too.

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.190
That dormitory uses gas.

01:05:58.360 --> 01:05:59.999
Although I'm not sure.
Find out.

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:02.356
Get the guys ready.
Two trucks at least

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:04.472
Check the fire hoses
and the equipment,

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:06.279
it's been ages since we used it.

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:09.792
Set up a blockade around
the perimeter. How long?

01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:11.719
How long is the perimeter?

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:14.316
We'll talk about overtime later.

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:17.917
Hey, watch your mouth,
or I'll get you fired.

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:22.394
Get me three ambulances, each with
a doctor and two paramedics.

01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:24.991
You guys ready? Let's go.

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:29.758
Wait!

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:32.635
What happened?
- Stand down for now.

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:34.599
Why?
- We have to wait.

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:37.554
For whom?
- I don't know. Nina said, wait.

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:01.116
Right... Let's go have a drink, guys.

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:12.436
Hey shit-stirrer, what are you
standing there for? Let's go!

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:14.837
You've got ulcers or what?

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:49.120
Let's talk here.
My relatives are visiting,

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:51.397
I don't want them to know anything.

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:54.030
I urgently need to resettle
600 people.

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:57.193
I need 200 apartments, 2 buildings.
Please help.

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:03.391
Are you insane?
How can I get you two buildings?

01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:08.992
The nine-story buildings you built
are still vacant, aren't they?

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.914
Those apartments were sold
even before we broke ground.

01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:18.758
Only for a couple of months.
I really need this, help me out.

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:21.389
My budget will be approved soon,
I'll buy them.

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:25.071
What? I could be locked up
for something like that.

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:30.270
For a month at least,
and then I'll think of something.

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:34.036
Then I'll resettle them
somewhere else.

01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:38.197
I have inspections
and showings every week.

01:08:38.359 --> 01:08:40.591
There can't be anyone there.

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:44.515
What are you doing, you bastard?

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:48.519
I sold you that land
for next to nothing.

01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:50.671
Don't you have a conscience?

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:56.800
I have 800 people living in a
dangerous building.

01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:00.112
I can't get them evacuated without
having a place to resettle them.

01:09:00.279 --> 01:09:02.272
The housing budget will come
under scrutiny.

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:05.796
They will put me away for 15 years,
like they did with Sorokin.

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:07.917
No one will touch you.

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:10.835
You pay a kickback to the governor,

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.754
giving him some votes.
There you go.

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:16.800
If he starts to pressure you,
threaten to give him up.

01:09:17.279 --> 01:09:20.000
He'll get you off the hook.
- Right, or kill me.

01:09:20.479 --> 01:09:22.711
I could be killed too.

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:30.551
Nina, I'm sorry, I can't.

01:09:33.359 --> 01:09:36.910
My investors used to tear people
to shreds back in the 1990s.

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:39.319
Sorry, I can't.

01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:05.192
Nina, you have no choice.

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:08.353
What do you mean?

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:12.792
You can't evacuate anyone
from that building.

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:18.200
So what should I do?
Bury them all in the rubble?

01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:23.193
Who said the building
will collapse for sure?

01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:26.840
Nikitin.
- That punk?

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:32.869
He just wants to sabotage Fedotov
and take his job.

01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:36.872
And don't listen to that idiot
waste-of-space Matyugin.

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:39.517
What about the risk?

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:43.310
The risk...
There's always a risk.

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:48.434
Are you one of Safronov's investors?

01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:51.598
Nina, stop it.

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:53.069
Are you?

01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:55.755
I saw how he looked at you.
Well?

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:00.554
I am.

01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:05.278
And what about the people?

01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:09.480
Living, breathing people,
you scumbag.

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:14.351
Shut your mouth, you bitch.

01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:27.192
When did you start worrying
about the people?

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:33.434
Only when 800 of them might
perish at once?

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:37.880
Were you worried about them
when they were dying one by one?

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:45.399
When you took a piece for yourself
out of every line in the budget.

01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:49.196
The roads are shit, one pot-hole

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:52.273
on top of another,
accidents every day.

01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:55.355
The people are drinking
themselves to death,

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:56.670
killing each other.

01:11:56.840 --> 01:12:00.914
because there are no decent jobs here,
and the wages wouldn't suit a beggar.

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:05.550
Kids are wasting their lives
and shooting up in basements.

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:11.077
The schools are a mess; teachers
and doctors can't afford to buy food.

01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:15.559
Old people and the disabled
are better off dying.

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:17.672
You and I have been through this.

01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:19.399
How much have I done for you?

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:22.029
You've been feeding
off me your entire life.

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:30.710
If it wasn't for me,
you'd still be a secretary.

01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:35.114
Because you're a nobody,
and I'm a somebody.

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:37.716
And the higher-ups know that.

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:40.271
Well?

01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:44.997
What's the matter with you?
Get yourself together.

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:48.519
Here, you either live like
a human being, or like cattle.

01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:51.315
There's not enough of the good life
to go around.

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:54.832
Divide it evenly, and
nobody will get anything.

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:57.430
Everyone will be equally poor.

01:12:58.560 --> 01:12:59.994
Come on...

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:04.875
Would that be better? No.

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:08.957
I helped you become somebody,

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:12.318
and you're biting the hand
that holds you.

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:25.395
Think about it long and hard -
are you with them or with us?

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:00.392
So what do we do now?

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:03.714
We'll think of something.
Get in the car.

01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:30.239
Look at them, all shitfaced,
and not giving a damn.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:32.956
What do they care?

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:37.080
They'll have different bosses,
but they will still have their jobs.

01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:40.870
Stop whining,
nothing's happened yet.

01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:48.472
Sometimes I think, why the hell
did I have to become the chief?

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:55.233
I could've continued
working as a surgeon;

01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:57.676
cut this, stitch that.

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:04.630
God forbid I'm ever on your
operating table.

01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:10.510
You will take out a kidney
and sell it.

01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:17.910
And you're an unselfish soul,
I suppose?

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:21.435
Catch a lot of crooks?

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:24.631
You're not so easy to catch.

01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:27.872
I try to put you away,
but you bribe me.

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:32.958
And I'm Russian,
can't help but take it.

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:41.949
Fedor, come dance with us...
- Get lost.

01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:52.194
Are you from another planet
or something?

01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:56.280
Anyone else
would've taken one look

01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:58.272
and gone back home to bed.

01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:02.153
Why do you care?

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:07.632
There are human beings in there.
- What human beings?

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:11.673
Trash...

01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:14.833
and rejects.

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:23.031
Maybe they should just die.
- Children too?

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:27.430
The ones smoking junk
and fucking in the attic?

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:32.679
What will they grow up to be?
You tell me!

01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:51.038
You shouldn't be grinding
that axe here, kid.

01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:57.473
We're old and seasoned.

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:02.919
We have seen a lot in this life.
Especially me.

01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:07.558
Every other person
in that dormitory either

01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:10.997
has an arrest or
a conviction to their name.

01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:14.111
If there were fewer
of those buildings,

01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:16.078
the world would be
a better place.

01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:20.314
and life would be easier
for normal people like us.

01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:31.714
Yes?

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:34.840
I'll be right back.

01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:36.796
Yes...

01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:06.075
One more round before we leave.

01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:25.917
So, looks like everything's back on.

01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:29.756
We're evacuating the tenants,
and waiting for inspectors.

01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:36.357
Nina wants to discuss something
with the three of you. On the spot.

01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:41.319
My boys will drive you there.
- We'll drive ourselves.

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:43.160
What, drunk?

01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:47.477
I forbid it as the chief of police.

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:16.591
...That's two more years of work.
I'm so sick of it.

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:19.751
Hey...
- Go home.

01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:27.553
Look, our very own bodyguards.
- Very funny. Get in.

01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:26.353
Well, are you happy now?

01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:35.354
Why is there so few of you guys?

01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:39.472
More are on their way.

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:47.319
Where are we going?
The 32nd is the other way.

01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:52.360
Don't listen,
drive where you were told.

01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:56.117
Why? He's driving
in the wrong direction.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.356
He's driving where we need to go.

01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:03.032
Hey, if you don't know the way,
let me drive.

01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:05.478
Shut up already!

01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:11.359
Watch who you're talking to.

01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:29.520
Galaganova...
That ruthless bitch...

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:33.198
What's the matter with you?

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:38.555
Tolya, that building will collapse.

01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:42.355
And we "ran away".

01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:45.038
What was it you said?

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:47.476
I "pocketed the money,
kicked some back to you",

01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:49.472
and you "never bothered to check"?

01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:52.394
They will blame everything
on the two of us.

01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:55.475
Sayapin is a bitch too.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.310
We're done for, Tolya.

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:07.631
What are you, nuts?
There are 800 people there.

01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:14.749
She'll get them out,
and blame us for the building.

01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:26.592
Hey guys, are you going to kill us?

01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:33.678
Well? Answer me!

01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:42.200
Shut your mouth and sit still.

01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:29.514
Stop here.

01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:55.794
Get back here.

01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:16.677
Let the kid go.

01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:20.511
He's just a plumber.

01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:25.158
He won't say anything.

01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:27.991
Are you fucking crazy?

01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:30.754
What the fuck is all this?

01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:32.793
Shut up!
- What?

01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:49.469
Go.

01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:53.438
Take your family and
leave town tonight.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.153
If you give us away,
we'll find you and kill you.

01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:20.919
What are you waiting for?

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.992
You really are a fucking fool.

01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:26.915
Get lost! Now!

01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:01.752
Take him to his bed.
- Leave it.

01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:11.877
Where is he?

01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:18.630
At work, that's where.
- What's this work at 3am?

01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:21.874
It is what it is.

01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:28.312
Get packing.
Mom, help her.

01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:31.160
Her things, Anton's and mine
- What happened?

01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:32.999
There's no time!
Get ready!

01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:35.072
Oh dear Lord...

01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:37.080
What happened?
- Don't ask.

01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:38.469
I barely made it out alive.

01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:40.632
We need to leave, for a long time.
Otherwise...

01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:45.431
Oh God! Holy Mother...
- Shut it and do as you are told!

01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:49.279
Let's get you a taxi.
- Too risky. We'll catch a ride.

01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:52.319
I'll go ask the neighbor for his car.
- I won't be able to return it!

01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:55.632
We won't get any poorer. Go pack.
I'll pull up to the entrance.

01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:56.995
Thanks.

01:26:57.320 --> 01:26:58.800
Should I take the summer clothes?

01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:00.599
Take everything.
And all money we have.

01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:02.956
How long will you be gone?
- Forever, Mom.

01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:08.910
Masha!
- Easy, easy. Sit down!

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:23.876
My baby, oh dear God...

01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:25.760
My son...

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.152
Oh dear God!
- Quit it, you'll wake everyone up.

01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:32.556
Oh Masha...

01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:36.038
Where are you headed?
- I'll think about it on the way.

01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:39.597
We must get out of town.
I'll call you when we get there.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:40.956
Mom.

01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:45.359
I knew you'd get yourself in trouble!
- Enough already, stop it.

01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:50.595
Off you go.
She'll keep wailing until you leave,

01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:52.797
and wake everyone up. Go!

01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:57.669
Oh God...
- Calm down, calm down.

01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:04.760
Dima! Son! My son...

01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:08.039
My son...
- Easy, easy, calm down.

01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:10.232
Dima...

01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:23.157
Good thing we got everyone drunk.

01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:25.717
And found all the documents.

01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:30.153
In the morning, nobody will
remember a thing.

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:34.035
Yes?

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:41.320
It's done?

01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:47.869
All clean?

01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:51.676
Good. Go home now.

01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:54.193
Get rid of the guns.

01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:58.031
I know they are government-issue,
but we'll write them off.

01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:04.678
God forbid they find the bodies and
we get caught over something stupid.

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:06.596
Bye.

01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:20.955
It's done.

01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:25.758
God forgive us.

01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:31.237
God created this life
and made us live it.

01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:35.958
All the documents are here.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:38.956
Do it.

01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:34.238
My husband is with Polosuhina
right now. Bastard.

01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:38.358
Quit sobbing.

01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:42.837
We'll send her away. Let her shake
her ass somewhere else.

01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:46.511
And send your husband in to see me.

01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:50.153
I'll explain to him how a man
ought to treat his wife.

01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:34.879
Has he calmed down?

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:37.080
He's asleep.

01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:42.154
What happened?

01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:46.511
Everything's rotten there, Masha.

01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:48.429
Where?

01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:51.632
The administrative board.

01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:58.273
It's a snake pit.

01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:03.993
A bunch of crooks.

01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:09.554
Ready to eat each other alive.
Vampires.

01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:14.116
When they realized
that they fucked up,

01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:16.192
they decided to frame their own.

01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:24.472
They put me, Fedotov
and the fire chief into a police car.

01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:27.717
And drove us to a quiet place.

01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:37.229
Fedotov turned out to be
a decent person

01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:41.712
I didn't expect that.

01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:45.597
He stood up for me

01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:49.117
and they let me go.

01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:07.756
So where are we going now?

01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:13.077
We need to get out of town.

01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:17.511
We'll spend the night in a hotel

01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:22.120
and think of something
in the morning.

01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:24.319
I promise.

01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:31.158
Well, thank you very much.

01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:35.112
We had a normal life.

01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:38.758
What were you thinking?

01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:42.191
I was thinking about
the people, dear.

01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:44.632
And Anton and I are not people?

01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:46.955
There are 800 people there.

01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:49.032
Are all of them your wives
and children?

01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:50.794
Masha, don't.
- Don't what?

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.151
I didn't know it would end this badly.

01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:57.634
How else could it have ended?

01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:02.317
They've been stealing for years.
They sucked the town dry.

01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:04.997
Did you go there to preach
and open their eyes?

01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:08.637
Did you expect them to start
righting their wrongs?

01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:09.711
Saving people?

01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:13.158
For them other people do not exist!
- For me they do!

01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:15.318
And I had to try.

01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:18.311
I will not be responsible
for the deaths

01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:19.675
of 800 people, got it?

01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:22.079
I get it.

01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:25.759
I get everything now.

01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:29.910
I get to suffer because
I live with you. - So don't!

01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:43.240
I'm sorry.

01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:47.120
I'm sorry.

01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:50.795
But I proved to them that
the building will collapse.

01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:53.919
At least they're getting the people
out of there right now.

01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:57.234
Out of where?
There's your dormitory over there.

01:34:57.400 --> 01:34:59.551
No one's around -
everyone's asleep!

01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:34.158
What the fuck are you
standing here for? Let's go!

01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:37.236
No one is there.
No firemen, no cops.

01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:40.472
Say that louder -
maybe they'll appear.

01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:42.359
They were supposed to be here.

01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:46.557
And supposed to do what?

01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:50.592
You sound like a kid.
What world do you live in?

01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:53.992
You were almost killed!
Snap out of it and let's go!

01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:57.513
What's the matter with you?

01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:02.038
Take Anton and go.

01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:08.200
You mean without you?

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.593
Yes, I'm staying.

01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:15.398
Are you leaving us behind?

01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:21.196
Masha, I'm not leaving
anyone behind.

01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:24.234
Can't you see? They're not getting
the people out.

01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:27.831
They decided to just leave
them there. - So what?

01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:31.833
Don't make me angry.

01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:34.955
Get in the car and go -
you have a license.

01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:39.558
What are you doing, you freak?
- Listen to yourself, you idiot.

01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:43.552
There are hundreds
of people in there.

01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:45.234
Have you no heart?

01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:48.590
Dima...

01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:50.914
they're nobodies to us.

01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:56.233
Shut your mouth.

01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:12.673
Masha, dear,
get in the car and leave.

01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:17.509
Don't you see that
I hate you right now?

01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:23.591
Don't you understand?

01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:27.951
We live like animals
and die like animals

01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:31.238
because we are nobodies
to each other.

01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:09.114
Tonya...

01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:13.752
Have a drink.
You'll feel better.

01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:34.159
Why are you here?
- I had to come back.

01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:36.949
Bastard!
Are you out of your mind?

01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:41.160
Leave, you hear me?
They'll catch you, you fool!

01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:44.393
Leave!
- Calm down.

01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:52.951
Why didn't you leave?
- I just couldn't.

01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:56.834
People will die.

01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:01.752
We drove past the dormitory -
nothing is happening.

01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:05.750
They are not evacuating.

01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:08.389
Because it's just
your stupid idea, you fool!

01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:12.873
The administration knows better.
It's not going to collapse!

01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:14.878
Who would want
to be responsible

01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:16.633
for so many deaths?
Fedotov?

01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:18.837
They killed Fedotov!

01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:32.350
Is Galaganova covering
her tracks?

01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:35.120
So what are you going to do?

01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:39.876
If anyone spots me, they'll kill me.

01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:42.958
Do the people
in the dormitory know

01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:44.634
that the building's unstable?

01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:46.510
No.

01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:50.115
So what are you waiting for?
Go tell them.

01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:51.800
Who's gonna listen to me?

01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:54.396
Who wants to be left out
on the street?

01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:55.915
I need an official order.

01:40:56.080 --> 01:40:58.151
The information has
to come from the top.

01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:01.120
Who am I?
I'm just a plumber.

01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:05.517
Are you sure that it will collapse?

01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:08.520
I'm sure.

01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:20.756
Forgive your mother and me, son.

01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:24.954
What for, Dad?

01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:30.592
What did we ever give you?

01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:33.074
Life.

01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:38.240
And what are you supposed
to do with this life?

01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:44.352
Look at your mom and I -
we argue every day.

01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:48.589
There's no love or joy left
between us.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.595
And we never taught you
how to live.

01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:02.273
We are to blame for everything
that's happened to you.

01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:05.639
Stop it, Dad.

01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:12.279
People are stealing
by the truckload.

01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:13.669
By the millions.

01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:17.716
They step over each other
and don't think twice.

01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:20.998
And you repair shitty pipes
for a living.

01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:24.679
You wanted to help,
to save people's lives -

01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:26.559
and they almost killed you.

01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:39.913
Leave, son.

01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:49.231
Things will never change
around here.

01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:54.518
Never.

01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:10.519
The building is collapsing!
Get outside! Quickly!

01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:14.752
Get outside, hurry!

01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:23.349
Get out of the building.

01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:25.870
What happened?
- The building is collapsing!

01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:28.231
Quickly! Get out!

01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:35.920
Olya, get dressed.
I said, get dressed! Move it!

01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:39.274
Get up! Run, outside!
The building is collapsing!

01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:50.230
Go outside!

01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:53.074
The building is falling,
you hear me?

01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:36.949
The building is falling.

01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:40.031
Oh yeah? Really?

01:46:40.600 --> 01:46:42.956
Even I don't drink that much!

01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:49.470
The building is falling.

01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:12.750
Let's go.

01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:20.037
Anyone here?

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:27.437
What's all this about?
Is this a set-up?

01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:39.669
Why are you standing here?
Move away!

01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:42.953
The building is collapsing!
Do you understand?

01:48:46.760 --> 01:48:49.514
Listen to me!
If you don't believe me...

01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:52.833
Quiet, everyone!
Calm down!

01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:56.395
Here's our hero!

01:48:57.200 --> 01:48:59.317
He's the man!

01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:02.713
Don't...
- Everything's fine.

01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:07.354
He is so brave!
Look how many people he saved!

01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:09.159
Stop it...
- Quiet!

01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:12.114
There are decent people
left in this world!

01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:15.756
You're fired!

01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:17.240
He's been sneaking around here.

01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:19.232
since yesterday, stirring
shit up! Get him!

01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:44.514
Go home, everyone!
Everything's fine.

01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:47.758
Don't touch me, you scum!

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:49.038
