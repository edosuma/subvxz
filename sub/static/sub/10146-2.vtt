WEBVTT

00:04.887 --> 00:07.047
These people should be
making demands, they should be

00:07.207 --> 00:09.767
asking for money. So whatever's
going on here, it's about a lot

00:09.887 --> 00:11.207
more than Chloe, and you know it.

00:11.367 --> 00:13.887
Keep the girl alive
until we are done.

00:14.047 --> 00:17.647
After that, kill her, sell her,
it does not matter.

00:17.807 --> 00:21.007
This character here,
he's part of a local gang.

00:21.167 --> 00:23.447
Aaron, muscle for his cousin,
Ray McQueen.

00:23.607 --> 00:25.927
Ensure Foster takes
this to the right place.

00:26.047 --> 00:28.807
You want me to bomb my own embassy?

00:28.927 --> 00:30.247
Clock's ticking, ambassador.

00:30.367 --> 00:31.367
Move! Move!

00:31.487 --> 00:33.607
I've got eyes on the girl.

00:33.767 --> 00:36.247
We have the girl. I repeat,
we have Chloe.

00:36.367 --> 00:37.367
General Ong Ji-Woo.

00:38.967 --> 00:40.807
I am so sorry.

00:40.927 --> 00:42.847
'They have the girl.' Chloe's safe!

00:42.967 --> 00:43.887
Go!

Robin.

01:16.727 --> 01:17.647
Robin!

01:18.847 --> 01:24.367
Talk to me. Chloe! She's fine.
Robin! We got her back.

01:24.527 --> 01:27.887
You didn't have to do this.
Robin! Robin!

01:28.007 --> 01:30.367
Oh, my God! What happened?

01:30.527 --> 01:34.007
Who told him to do this, Mei?
Don't touch him!

01:34.127 --> 01:35.887
This is because of you and your men!

01:36.047 --> 01:38.167
You listen to me!

01:38.287 --> 01:40.687
This is important. I need to know.

01:40.847 --> 01:44.727
Did Robin talk to you about what he
was doing today, where he was going?

01:46.567 --> 01:50.527
He said he trusted you.
He believed in you.

01:59.327 --> 02:00.287
Careful.

02:21.727 --> 02:24.127
OK, Chloe, look, listen to me.

02:24.287 --> 02:28.687
Your dad's been injured but he's
going to be OK. Dad? Chloe.

02:28.807 --> 02:29.727
Sir?

02:34.087 --> 02:36.767
Sir, where to?
Will you just give me a minute?

02:39.887 --> 02:43.007
We're going to need a new base.
Somewhere off the grid.

02:44.607 --> 02:46.687
Away from this bloody mess.

02:46.847 --> 02:49.567
What about Stonebridge's
civilian contact?

02:49.687 --> 02:53.167
Garland. That is a very good idea.

02:53.287 --> 02:54.807
We'll set up the crib there.

02:54.927 --> 02:56.367
Scott and Stonebridge?

02:56.487 --> 02:58.087
They're bringing in McQueen.

03:07.887 --> 03:11.687
How's the shoulder, Mikey? You have
to pop it back in. Yeah, I know.

03:11.807 --> 03:14.047
I will. Just keep moving.

03:14.167 --> 03:15.927
Bravo One and Two, send sit-rep.

03:16.047 --> 03:17.327
We have McQueen.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.887
We're regrouping at Garland's place.

03:20.047 --> 03:22.327
Listen, Michael, someone's
just blown the hell out of

03:22.487 --> 03:24.247
the North Korean delegation
at the embassy.

03:24.407 --> 03:26.367
McQueen's our only link
to the people behind it.

03:26.487 --> 03:29.007
You get him back fast. Roger that.

03:29.167 --> 03:31.887
They're not going to
let you take me. Shut up.

03:32.047 --> 03:33.967
We're doing a pretty good job of it
so far.

03:34.087 --> 03:35.047
No, no, no. Not them.

03:36.207 --> 03:37.127
Them.

03:41.687 --> 03:43.807
'This is the police!

03:43.967 --> 03:47.087
'Lower your weapons
and raise your hands.

03:47.247 --> 03:50.247
'If you do not comply,
we will open fire.'

03:50.407 --> 03:53.447
We're from the embassy.
We're British officials.

03:53.567 --> 03:56.087
'You have five seconds to comply.

03:56.207 --> 03:57.487
'Five...

03:59.367 --> 04:00.367
'..four...'

04:00.487 --> 04:01.447
Any ideas, Mikey?

04:01.607 --> 04:02.487
- Hm.
- '..three...'

04:02.647 --> 04:04.607
Yeah, let's put the guns down
and raise our hands.

04:04.767 --> 04:07.007
'..two...'
All right, all right, all right.

04:08.167 --> 04:09.927
'The other hand!
Raise the other hand!'

04:10.047 --> 04:12.647
I can't. It hurts.

04:12.767 --> 04:13.687
Pussies.

04:15.607 --> 04:18.927
I'm taking this man into custody.
You can't do that. He's ours.

04:19.087 --> 04:21.807
- 'Hands up!'
- All right, all right, all right.

04:21.927 --> 04:23.247
It's always negotiable.

04:24.967 --> 04:26.887
You take care of yourselves, boys.

04:30.487 --> 04:31.447
Shit.

04:32.887 --> 04:35.007
'Keep your hands up!'

04:35.127 --> 04:36.207
Un-cuff me.

04:38.047 --> 04:40.367
Un-cuff me, Janjai. I have him.

04:40.487 --> 04:44.287
Good. Kill him. 'I can't. Not here.

04:44.407 --> 04:45.607
'Not all these men are mine.'

04:45.727 --> 04:48.727
'He is a liability.' Don't worry.

04:48.887 --> 04:52.487
He won't talk. I'll make sure
he gets... Lee, we had a deal.

04:52.647 --> 04:56.087
I told you what would happen
if you failed. No failure on my end.

04:59.847 --> 05:02.807
Get him! They're going to kill me.
What do you want to know?

05:02.927 --> 05:03.847
Aargh!

05:16.487 --> 05:18.127
Brilliant. There goes the one link

05:18.287 --> 05:20.567
into finding out
who's behind all this.

05:20.687 --> 05:22.327
You know what, Mikey?

05:22.487 --> 05:24.687
I predict this is going to
end in some big gunfight,

05:24.847 --> 05:28.127
a lot of bloodshed,
you and me stuck in the middle.

05:28.247 --> 05:29.567
As always.

05:29.687 --> 05:30.887
Well...

05:31.007 --> 05:32.527
what are we waiting for?

06:10.727 --> 06:15.007
Philip, in one hour I have to explain
to the PM how our own ambassador

06:15.167 --> 06:18.327
facilitated the assassination of the
North Korean delegates. I understand.

06:18.487 --> 06:20.247
And how the hell some
low-level British thug

06:20.407 --> 06:22.887
like McQueen can be behind it all.
'Well, I don't think he is.'

06:23.007 --> 06:26.767
I think he was working for someone
else. 'Who?' Well, I don't know yet.

06:28.527 --> 06:31.207
What I do know is that someone paid
him to kidnap Foster's daughter

06:31.367 --> 06:33.967
and then forced the ambassador
to carry a bomb through security.

06:34.087 --> 06:35.407
And you couldn't stop it?

06:37.207 --> 06:39.647
We got his daughter back... alive.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.487
But not McQueen.

06:41.647 --> 06:43.767
Well, we had him
and then we lost him.

06:43.927 --> 06:46.047
Philip, I understand things
happen in the field

06:46.207 --> 06:48.047
but if your men
aren't up to the task...

06:48.207 --> 06:50.807
They are and you know they are.
We have a lead on McQueen.

06:50.967 --> 06:53.287
I'm on my way there now.
'Bring him in.'

06:53.407 --> 06:55.887
Because the fallout from this is...

06:56.047 --> 06:59.607
Look, I've always backed you
in the past. That hasn't changed

06:59.727 --> 07:02.447
so, please, don't let me down.

07:14.127 --> 07:17.247
This is the safe house?
What do you want? The Four Seasons?

07:17.407 --> 07:22.047
Shit, I'd settle for one season.
Not on our budget.

07:22.167 --> 07:23.167
Ladies, this way.

07:33.887 --> 07:34.847
Yeah.

07:34.967 --> 07:36.327
All right. All right, OK.

07:36.447 --> 07:38.727
Brilliant. Brilliant.

07:38.847 --> 07:40.527
Of course. Here you go, ladies.

07:42.127 --> 07:44.407
Hello. Hey, Michael.

07:45.887 --> 07:47.527
How you doing, Mike? Yeah, good.

07:47.647 --> 07:49.007
Does this stuff even work?

07:49.127 --> 07:50.967
It old but it's good equipment.

07:51.127 --> 07:53.647
I keep it squared away for any
operators that come through.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.527
Anything more I can do, you let me
know. Thanks for everything, Tom.

07:56.647 --> 07:58.687
Cheers, mate. Hey, cheers.

08:00.887 --> 08:03.047
'Officials in Pyongyang
are calling the death of

08:03.167 --> 08:05.127
'General Ong Ji-Woo an act of war.

08:05.287 --> 08:08.327
'They warn that reprisals
will be swift and aggressive.'

08:22.527 --> 08:23.487
Sir.

08:25.207 --> 08:26.687
Anything?

08:26.807 --> 08:28.567
Not yet.

08:28.687 --> 08:30.287
They went in about an hour ago.

08:31.567 --> 08:35.527
I made some calls. The Thai police
are saying they don't have him.

08:35.647 --> 08:39.047
That's funny. I saw him walk in.

08:39.167 --> 08:40.847
'Bravo Two, are you in position?'

08:42.886 --> 08:45.767
Yes, I am, Michael.
How's your shoulder?

08:45.927 --> 08:48.367
Hey, it's fine, it's fine.
I should be out there with you.

08:48.487 --> 08:50.807
'Sit-rep?' Got eyes on McQueen.

08:55.687 --> 08:56.647
He's on the move.

09:08.327 --> 09:11.567
Go, go, go. No, no, no. Move!

09:11.687 --> 09:13.767
No. Move! Move!

09:13.927 --> 09:16.367
We're not going anywhere
in that fucking car.

09:19.047 --> 09:20.607
Hey. Hey.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.847
Bravo Two, are you in pursuit?

09:22.967 --> 09:24.647
'Well, kind of, Mikey.'

09:33.607 --> 09:34.767
What is that?

09:34.887 --> 09:36.087
Benz.

09:36.207 --> 09:38.007
Yeah, yeah, Benz. That's me.

09:39.327 --> 09:42.367
Well, Mr Benz, you follow
that police car.

09:42.487 --> 09:44.647
That one?

09:44.767 --> 09:47.087
Wherever they go, we go. Got it.

10:02.487 --> 10:06.967
Mike, there is still no record
of McQueen in the Thai system.

10:07.127 --> 10:12.007
OK. Bravo Two, wherever they're
taking McQueen, it's not official.

10:12.127 --> 10:14.807
We cannot afford to lose him again.

10:14.967 --> 10:17.647
So is that an order to
take down a Thai police convoy?

10:19.727 --> 10:22.327
No, I want us to retrieve a prisoner
that you lost, Scott.

10:23.887 --> 10:25.207
Is something funny?

10:25.327 --> 10:27.487
Yeah, funny, sure.

10:27.647 --> 10:31.207
You take down police convoy
with a couple of water pistols.

10:31.327 --> 10:32.647
You don't think that's funny?

10:32.807 --> 10:35.767
Look, you want out, I'll give you
100 baht for this piece of junk.

10:35.927 --> 10:38.007
Hey, you get tuk-tuk,
you get nothing.

10:38.127 --> 10:39.767
Driver is everything.

10:39.927 --> 10:42.727
But anyway this sanuk, OK?
You know sanuk?

10:42.847 --> 10:44.207
Yeah, it means fun, huh?

10:44.367 --> 10:49.087
Yeah, and I haven't had fun
like this since I was a monk.

10:49.247 --> 10:51.687
You were a monk? Of course.
You were not a monk?

10:51.807 --> 10:53.687
Yeah, Scott, you should try it.

10:53.847 --> 10:57.247
Oh, no, I think Michael's
got that monk thing covered.

11:05.007 --> 11:09.647
Shit. What, you're taking a call
now? Yeah. I've got to, boss.

11:09.767 --> 11:12.287
It's my ex. She never calls me.

11:12.407 --> 11:14.807
Kelly. Yeah, hi.

11:14.927 --> 11:16.247
Don't get too close.

11:16.407 --> 11:19.807
No, I'm kind of in the middle of
something right now.

11:19.927 --> 11:20.847
Yeah, working.

11:22.007 --> 11:23.687
Yes, I'm in Bangkok.

11:23.807 --> 11:25.767
Don't lose them, Benz.

11:25.887 --> 11:27.247
Lose them? Never.

11:27.367 --> 11:29.807
I am number one tuk-tuk in Bangkok.

11:29.927 --> 11:33.047
Are you fucking kidding me? When?

11:36.047 --> 11:37.927
All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:38.047 --> 11:39.727
Thanks.

11:39.847 --> 11:41.607
Fuck me.

11:44.247 --> 11:47.367
I missed my kid's 16th birthday.

11:47.487 --> 11:49.847
He got drunk and boosted a car.

11:50.007 --> 11:53.087
Got on a plane to Bangkok.
He's going to be here in 17 hours.

11:54.727 --> 11:57.687
You have a son? Yeah.

12:17.287 --> 12:20.167
OK, good. I wait here for you, OK?
What? You're not going to come?

12:20.327 --> 12:22.007
What about your sense of sanuk, huh?

12:22.167 --> 12:25.967
Sanuk OK, but if I die, many, many
unhappy ladies!

12:26.087 --> 12:29.047
Me too! Hey, for you.

12:29.207 --> 12:32.207
For me? Yeah, too many people
here don't like to pay.

12:32.327 --> 12:34.207
Exactly what kind of monk were you?

12:35.687 --> 12:37.207
Angry kind.

13:09.127 --> 13:10.487
I know what you're doing.

13:12.367 --> 13:14.927
I've put a dozen bodies
in here myself.

13:18.847 --> 13:20.207
I made you a rich man.

13:23.767 --> 13:27.167
This is how you want to
repay me, yeah? You snake.

13:27.287 --> 13:30.327
You just another fucking farang.

13:30.487 --> 13:33.887
You marry a Thai and you
think you can be one of us.

13:34.007 --> 13:35.567
But you're not.

13:35.687 --> 13:38.807
I count four SWATs with MP5s.

13:38.927 --> 13:40.887
There's another guy with a shot gun.

13:42.327 --> 13:44.687
So, here's what we... Scott.

13:44.807 --> 13:46.487
Yeah? Are you ready?

13:48.207 --> 13:50.767
Nah, not really.

13:50.927 --> 13:53.447
He's my own son.
I've never even fucking met him.

13:53.607 --> 13:56.847
And what do I tell him I do
for a job? Sergeant.

13:56.967 --> 13:58.327
I meant this.

13:58.487 --> 14:04.007
Oh, this? Saving the bad guy from
the worse guy? That's the easy part.

14:06.847 --> 14:08.607
You come to bleed my country.

14:11.727 --> 14:12.847
I bleed you instead.

14:16.367 --> 14:17.807
So what's our plan?

14:17.927 --> 14:19.887
I was getting to that.

14:20.007 --> 14:21.647
What have you got?

14:23.407 --> 14:24.967
Nice.

14:25.087 --> 14:26.207
You ride shotgun.

14:28.807 --> 14:30.607
Now, you listen to me, Changrok.

14:30.670 --> 14:32.130
When Lee's got no more use for you,

14:32.190 --> 14:34.790
he will find someone to put
a bullet through your head.

14:34.910 --> 14:36.470
Police are always useful.

14:37.990 --> 14:39.830
Criminals?

14:39.990 --> 14:41.990
Turn over a rock,
and a dozen like you.

14:44.870 --> 14:46.950
But I'm sorry about
your wife and baby.

14:52.390 --> 14:57.230
Go near my family and I'll
cut your fucking eyes out.

15:01.150 --> 15:02.270
I have my order.

15:21.830 --> 15:24.510
Raise the fucking bucket! Sir!

15:24.670 --> 15:27.670
These things are a lot more
complicated than they look.

15:30.670 --> 15:31.630
Got it.

15:48.990 --> 15:51.110
Here. Cover me. I'll get McQueen.

16:05.470 --> 16:06.990
Hey, scumbag.

16:07.150 --> 16:09.470
All right, dickhead, you going
to kill me, then, or what?

16:09.590 --> 16:11.070
You don't get off that easy.

16:18.390 --> 16:19.750
Scott, talk to me!

16:19.910 --> 16:22.710
Coming to you, boss.
I got the package. Get up!

16:22.830 --> 16:24.070
Come on.

16:24.230 --> 16:28.110
Changrok! You go near my family,
I'll fucking skin you!

16:28.230 --> 16:30.230
Get up there. On me!

16:34.510 --> 16:36.510
In. Get in!

16:36.630 --> 16:38.590
Come on! Go! Go!

16:49.630 --> 16:52.790
Who begged you to take that girl?
Changrok?

16:54.470 --> 16:56.510
Not going to talk?

16:58.670 --> 17:00.670
Don't talk, I will shoot you.

17:00.790 --> 17:01.710
Do it.

17:02.870 --> 17:03.830
Do it!

17:04.990 --> 17:06.349
Boss? Just hit him again.

17:08.390 --> 17:11.109
Argh, motherfuck...!

17:12.470 --> 17:13.670
Talk now?

17:13.790 --> 17:16.270
Come on! Fucking talk!

17:19.630 --> 17:22.790
There's only two lives I care
about, you fucking dickhead.

17:22.910 --> 17:24.230
Neither of them are mine.

17:25.990 --> 17:28.190
His wife. All right, scumbag.

17:29.510 --> 17:32.270
We get your wife safe and you tell
us who's behind the kidnapping,

17:32.390 --> 17:34.150
the bombing, everything.

17:36.950 --> 17:40.030
You get her safe,
I'll tell you whatever you want.

17:40.150 --> 17:42.630
You got that, Mikey? His wife?

17:42.790 --> 17:44.990
Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.
Oh, no, no, no.

17:45.110 --> 17:47.550
We've got this one, boss.

17:47.670 --> 17:49.670
Then go. Go.

18:07.510 --> 18:10.110
Get in there. Welcome home.
Stick him in there. Yeah.

18:10.270 --> 18:14.510
McQueen, you better start thinking
about what you're going to tell us.

18:14.630 --> 18:16.470
When my wife is safe.

18:19.990 --> 18:22.710
Move. I'll tell you one thing.

18:24.270 --> 18:28.070
You guys are going to
need more men. Come on.

18:28.230 --> 18:30.310
You still have operational
command until I get back.

18:30.470 --> 18:33.590
Yeah, Roger that, boss.
Can I ask where you're going?

18:33.710 --> 18:34.630
Out.

18:37.270 --> 18:39.550
Stay there, shit-head.

18:39.670 --> 18:42.030
Where's he going?

18:42.150 --> 18:44.390
Out. Huh! Yeah.

18:45.590 --> 18:47.590
Beer? It's my kind of crib.

18:47.710 --> 18:48.710
How was the old man?

18:48.830 --> 18:51.070
You know what, Michael?

18:51.190 --> 18:52.910
He wasn't half bad. Really?

18:53.030 --> 18:55.230
No, seriously.

18:55.350 --> 18:56.750
No, I'm all right, thanks.

19:01.270 --> 19:03.070
All right.

19:04.870 --> 19:07.630
How's this whole operational
command going for you?

19:07.790 --> 19:10.710
To tell you the truth, it's not
really my cup of tea. No? No.

19:10.870 --> 19:15.270
That kind of suits you.
Oh, really? Yeah.

19:15.430 --> 19:17.710
Bet you could get used to it.
Why's that?

19:19.710 --> 19:22.230
Well, old Locke can't run
the unit forever, can he?

19:22.390 --> 19:24.150
One of us is going
to have to step up.

19:24.270 --> 19:25.830
Yeah, well, it's not going to be me.

19:25.950 --> 19:28.270
And it ain't going to be me. Yeah.

19:32.350 --> 19:33.830
Seriously, though.

19:33.990 --> 19:36.390
Have you given it some thought?
Just a little bit?

19:36.510 --> 19:37.990
Yeah, I think about it all the time.

19:38.150 --> 19:39.750
Me sitting in here
stuck behind a desk

19:39.910 --> 19:42.230
while you're out there
having all the fun.

19:43.910 --> 19:45.430
Sounds kind of good to me.

19:57.110 --> 19:59.950
You want to tell me what's wrong or
are you just going to drink it away?

20:04.030 --> 20:05.350
Well...

20:08.230 --> 20:10.910
..working on being father
of the year in about 16 hours.

20:12.430 --> 20:14.150
That's when Finn lands in Bangkok.

20:35.950 --> 20:38.270
Zero from Bravo Three,
we're at the location.

20:44.590 --> 20:46.670
Shit. Changrok's boys beat us to it.

20:51.510 --> 20:53.110
Clear.

20:53.230 --> 20:54.910
Zero? Police already here.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.350
All right, I'm Zero.

21:01.190 --> 21:03.630
'Zero from Brave Three and Four, '

21:03.750 --> 21:06.270
proceed,

21:06.390 --> 21:07.630
watch your corners...

21:09.950 --> 21:11.910
'..and your fine little asses.'

21:12.030 --> 21:13.630
Thanks for the tip, Zero!

21:15.230 --> 21:16.470
And you can kiss my ass.

21:59.830 --> 22:01.670
Contact. Shots fired.

22:01.790 --> 22:04.390
Malai! I'm here to help you.

22:10.230 --> 22:12.110
My name is Kim Martinez.

22:12.230 --> 22:13.350
Ray sent me.

22:18.550 --> 22:20.190
Ray sent me!

22:20.310 --> 22:22.110
You think I'm stupid?

22:22.270 --> 22:24.470
The police are here.
The choice is yours.

22:28.990 --> 22:31.230
He told me to tell you

22:31.390 --> 22:34.310
that your daughter's going to be
a Muay Thai champion.

22:41.950 --> 22:44.750
Give me the gun.
Give me the goddamn gun!

22:55.830 --> 22:57.110
Move your ass.

22:59.230 --> 23:01.070
Get up the stairs.

23:01.190 --> 23:02.750
What took you so long?

23:02.870 --> 23:04.190
Housework.

23:25.710 --> 23:28.830
What are you doing here?
Mei, I just wanted to talk to him.

23:28.990 --> 23:31.110
This happened because of you.
Please leave!

23:31.270 --> 23:32.750
I don't want you to be
talking to him.

23:34.110 --> 23:35.750
Why is that?

23:35.870 --> 23:37.310
Out, OUT!

23:38.670 --> 23:41.990
Hmm, why is that? What would he say?

23:44.190 --> 23:46.310
If you know something,
you have to tell me.

23:46.430 --> 23:48.550
What, so you can bury him?

23:48.710 --> 23:51.750
No, so I can help him.
So, what would he say?

23:53.950 --> 23:55.950
What would he tell me? Do you know?

23:56.070 --> 23:57.030
No.

23:57.150 --> 23:58.630
Don't you dare lie to me!

23:58.750 --> 24:00.510
He killed those people,

24:00.670 --> 24:02.990
he knew there would be
terrible consequences.

24:03.150 --> 24:06.790
To save our daughter's life. What
would you have done for your son?

24:08.590 --> 24:10.750
No-one gave me that choice.

24:10.910 --> 24:15.390
If they had,
you would have done the same thing.

24:15.510 --> 24:17.590
Tell me that isn't true.

24:27.070 --> 24:29.870
Somebody has to take
the blame for this.

24:31.230 --> 24:33.990
But, Philip,
it doesn't have to be Robin.

24:34.110 --> 24:37.350
No, no, it doesn't.

24:37.510 --> 24:41.230
Because we have the man
who took Chloe. You do? Good.

24:41.350 --> 24:43.590
Has he said anything? No, not yet.

24:43.750 --> 24:46.670
He's just a puppet for someone else,
but...

24:46.790 --> 24:48.990
I promise you, Mei, he will talk.

24:49.150 --> 24:51.910
We'll gain leverage
and he will tell us everything.

24:53.070 --> 24:55.390
And then we'll find out
who's really behind this.

25:03.110 --> 25:05.910
Ray! Everything is going
to be OK, sweetheart.

25:06.070 --> 25:08.230
Everything is going to be OK,
honey bunny.

25:08.390 --> 25:11.470
Shut her up, that's enough.
Put her over there. Satisfied?

25:13.270 --> 25:14.550
Now...

25:14.670 --> 25:16.030
talk.

25:17.702 --> 25:20.262
The man I deal with is called Lee.

25:20.839 --> 25:23.014
He's not Thai, he's North Korean.

25:23.047 --> 25:25.007
You're saying a North Korean
paid you? Mm-hmm.

25:25.039 --> 25:26.439
To kidnap the ambassador's daughter

25:26.474 --> 25:27.934
and make the ambassador
plant a bomb?

25:27.969 --> 25:29.969
To blow up some North Koreans.

25:30.028 --> 25:33.188
Look,
Lee is no ordinary North Korean.

25:35.189 --> 25:36.549
He's Office 39.

25:39.349 --> 25:41.069
As in North Korea's
government-sponsored

25:41.189 --> 25:42.269
crime syndicate, yeah?

25:45.029 --> 25:47.109
It meant nothing to me
the first time I heard it.

25:47.229 --> 25:48.309
Office 39 are pretty much

25:48.469 --> 25:50.909
the most ruthless covert
organisation on the planet.

25:51.069 --> 25:53.669
Into drugs,
human trafficking, murder,

25:53.829 --> 25:56.309
anything that generates
hard currency

25:56.469 --> 25:59.589
for the North Korean
nuclear missile programme.

25:59.709 --> 26:01.189
What doesn't make sense to me

26:01.349 --> 26:04.429
is why would they blow up
their own diplomats?

26:04.589 --> 26:07.949
So they can blame the West for
the incident. Escalate tension...

26:09.828 --> 26:11.108
..and maybe start a war.

26:12.869 --> 26:15.709
The embassy bomb was
just the first step.

26:15.869 --> 26:19.109
We need hard intel, anything
that points to their next move.

26:19.229 --> 26:21.629
Where do we find them, McQueen?

26:21.789 --> 26:24.469
They operate out of an abandoned
high-rise near the docks.

26:24.629 --> 26:27.229
Lee's main base is
the top of the tower.

26:27.389 --> 26:29.349
He's got hacking stations,
a crystal meth lab,

26:29.509 --> 26:33.509
smuggles fake currency, arms,
fuck knows what else.

26:33.669 --> 26:37.549
The place is locked down.
Guards everywhere.

26:37.669 --> 26:39.429
No way in, no way out.

26:55.589 --> 26:56.669
Hey, Mikey...

26:58.749 --> 26:59.829
..going up?

26:59.949 --> 27:01.669
Oh, shit!

27:03.669 --> 27:05.509
Inside or outside?

27:07.669 --> 27:09.069
Oh, bollocks! Yeah!

27:39.549 --> 27:43.269
Sir? I've got a face to the name.

27:43.429 --> 27:45.389
I checked Lee Dae-Ho
against all known aliases.

27:45.509 --> 27:46.469
If he's Office 39,

27:46.629 --> 27:49.469
he probably would've worked through
the North Korean First Bureau,

27:49.589 --> 27:51.709
which led me to this.

27:57.823 --> 28:00.143
What the hell?
How did Changrok know we were here?

28:00.253 --> 28:01.533
Were you tailed, Colonel?

28:01.652 --> 28:03.332
No, I wasn't. I'm sure of it.

28:03.493 --> 28:05.853
I told you -
Office 39 know everything.

28:05.903 --> 28:06.943
Will you shut up?

28:07.103 --> 28:09.903
Richmond, give Bravo Team
a sit-rep then exfil.

28:10.063 --> 28:13.463
'Bravo team, crib has been
compromised. SWAT incoming.

28:13.623 --> 28:15.863
'We're on the move and going dark.'
Do we need back-up?

28:15.983 --> 28:18.503
Do you want us to abort?

28:18.623 --> 28:19.863
Shit!

28:20.023 --> 28:22.543
Should we abort?
What, you're asking me? Yeah.

28:22.703 --> 28:25.903
You're the one being groomed
for command, Mikey. Says you.

28:26.023 --> 28:26.943
Haha! Get in.

28:28.783 --> 28:31.663
Right, take the hard drives. Destroy
everything else. We need to move.

28:31.783 --> 28:33.703
Now!

28:37.703 --> 28:39.543
Move!

28:39.663 --> 28:41.623
Martinez...

28:41.743 --> 28:43.543
Malai, you stay close to me.

28:43.703 --> 28:46.823
All right, put your hand there
and you keep it there.

28:46.943 --> 28:48.183
Move, go!

28:49.583 --> 28:50.943
Exfil via the roof, one floor up.

29:04.223 --> 29:07.543
Four more floors. We go in,
we grab the intel and we get out.

29:07.703 --> 29:10.823
That was already the plan.
It's a good plan.

29:10.983 --> 29:13.103
You know what they say about plans,
Mikey.

29:13.263 --> 29:15.943
They never survive contact
with the enemy. Wow!

29:16.103 --> 29:18.343
You didn't know I knew that one,
huh? Who said it?

29:18.463 --> 29:20.023
Miley Cyrus?

29:39.743 --> 29:41.063
Martinez, cover our six.

29:41.183 --> 29:42.543
Copy that, sir.

29:55.543 --> 29:57.823
We should get these boys
to clean the crib.

30:03.183 --> 30:04.743
Contact!

30:12.023 --> 30:13.823
Three, two, one...

30:16.903 --> 30:17.943
Incoming!

30:27.103 --> 30:29.223
Where is that exit? Exit secure!

30:31.303 --> 30:32.943
Don't even think about it.

30:33.103 --> 30:36.383
Let me out, give me the gun.
Give me that!

30:36.503 --> 30:38.903
Ray! Go! Ray, no! Go! No!

30:39.023 --> 30:40.903
You've got to go! Come on!

30:41.063 --> 30:43.543
Cover us
and I can get her out of here.

30:43.663 --> 30:45.663
Make sure she remembers her daddy.

30:45.783 --> 30:47.943
Please! Move!

31:15.583 --> 31:18.423
You know you're dying.
If you have a God, pray.

31:19.783 --> 31:22.223
This is the world which you
used to live in, Ray.

31:23.463 --> 31:24.863
We are not the bad men.

31:26.023 --> 31:28.263
We are the pawns for
the greater power.

31:29.343 --> 31:31.583
Easy for you to say, Changrok.

31:31.743 --> 31:34.903
You believe in reincarnation
and all that shit.

31:35.063 --> 31:38.263
It's good to believe in something,
right?

31:38.423 --> 31:40.343
Yeah.

31:40.503 --> 31:45.063
Well, let's hope you come back as
the fucking cockroach you really are.

31:47.623 --> 31:49.503
See you in the next life, motherf...

32:04.907 --> 32:08.707
25th floor, Mikey. Meth lab.

32:12.457 --> 32:14.177
Follow that wire.

32:27.033 --> 32:28.793
Three, two, one...

33:10.856 --> 33:13.496
Someone told Changrok where we were.
Yeah, but who?

33:13.577 --> 33:16.937
Did you tell the ambassador? I didn't
talk to him. I saw his wife...

33:18.618 --> 33:20.138
..and their assistant Lawan.

33:21.458 --> 33:23.618
Lawan was there for everything.

33:23.778 --> 33:26.138
Handed over the first message
from the kidnappers.

33:26.298 --> 33:29.458
She could have tipped them off
about you in the nightclub

33:29.618 --> 33:31.698
and she could have followed me
from the hospital.

33:31.858 --> 33:33.578
Well, let's question her.
Where is she?

33:33.738 --> 33:37.338
She's at the hospital with Foster
and Mei. Richmond? Yes, sir.

33:44.138 --> 33:46.378
Mrs Foster,
I've arranged the car to take you

33:46.538 --> 33:48.978
and Chloe back to the residence.
No, I'm not leaving.

33:49.138 --> 33:53.098
I want to stay here with Dad.
He needs to rest and so do you.

33:54.538 --> 33:57.138
And you're not going to listen
to a word I say, are you?

33:59.218 --> 34:01.538
At least go with Lawan
to get something to eat.

34:01.658 --> 34:03.098
Come. Come on.

34:09.818 --> 34:12.578
You go. It's OK.

34:12.697 --> 34:14.658
I love you.

34:19.338 --> 34:21.138
Come on.

34:21.297 --> 34:24.257
Gentlemen, there's a lot of
equipment up here. What's it for?

34:24.418 --> 34:30.138
You two been naughty? Hmm? Online
gambling? Been looking up some porn?

34:30.297 --> 34:34.458
Whatever it is, I'm going to find
out. English, do you speak it?

34:34.618 --> 34:38.178
But you understood that.
That's convenient, isn't it?

34:38.297 --> 34:40.338
What's Office 39 doing here?

34:40.498 --> 34:42.418
Whatever it is,
this little machine here

34:42.578 --> 34:45.578
is going to find out exactly
what he's up to. Yeah, eventually.

34:45.697 --> 34:47.297
Shut up, dude. I'm not Richmond!

34:47.458 --> 34:50.138
Well, maybe you should be.
Up! This way.

34:52.058 --> 34:54.257
You take the lead.
You, you sit down.

34:54.378 --> 34:57.978
And you, oi! Look that way.

34:58.098 --> 35:00.458
You, look right here.

35:00.578 --> 35:02.338
Shit!

35:03.458 --> 35:04.698
Scott!

35:04.858 --> 35:08.538
Super notes.
What's this, huh? Huh?

35:08.658 --> 35:10.298
You're going to flood the market

35:10.458 --> 35:12.738
with your counterfeit currency,
is that it?

35:21.098 --> 35:22.898
Shit!

35:23.018 --> 35:24.458
Scott...

35:24.578 --> 35:27.858
It's Chloe. Fucking scumbags!

35:31.698 --> 35:33.258
"Sasam." "Sasam".

35:33.378 --> 35:36.458
Yeah, that's right, what is "Sasam"?

35:38.858 --> 35:41.938
English, dickhead.
We know you speak it. Fuck you!

35:43.818 --> 35:45.738
I understand that. Fuck me?

35:48.338 --> 35:51.778
Hey, he's got cyanide!
Come here. Hey! Shit! I've got him.

35:51.898 --> 35:53.458
You pick up that folder.

36:23.338 --> 36:25.658
Scott, I'm on the north side
of the building.

36:25.778 --> 36:27.138
I've got about 12 x-rays inbound.

36:27.298 --> 36:28.898
I could use a little
fucking help here!

36:34.018 --> 36:35.738
Coming up on your six, Mike.

36:37.378 --> 36:39.458
Bravos from Zero, sit-rep.

36:40.818 --> 36:45.178
'We've got the hard drives and the
intel from Office 39.' OK, good job.

36:45.338 --> 36:47.378
We are heading towards the hospital.
RV there.

36:53.338 --> 36:56.218
Nice to see you.
They're on my six. Can you exfil?

36:56.378 --> 36:59.618
Yeah, that's easier said than done,
boss. You said it, Mikey.

36:59.778 --> 37:02.218
'Just make sure you
bring me that intel.'

37:16.018 --> 37:19.298
Mate, this is a hell of a time to be
checking your Facebook status.

37:19.418 --> 37:21.338
Poor planning, Michael.

37:21.458 --> 37:22.498
Poor planning.

37:22.698 --> 37:25.538
Speaking of which, there must be
half a tonne of meth in those barrels.

37:27.298 --> 37:28.418
Here we go.

37:41.938 --> 37:46.658
There is nowhere for you to go.
Come out. You will be unharmed.

37:46.818 --> 37:49.338
North Korea's got a shitty
track record on human rights.

37:51.578 --> 37:54.938
That's a no. Then you will die
up here. I don't think so.

37:55.098 --> 37:57.938
I think you got that
the wrong way round, buddy.

37:59.658 --> 38:02.618
You will kill me?
I serve a higher power.

38:03.938 --> 38:06.778
It would be an honour to die for
my country.

38:06.898 --> 38:08.578
Yeah, I can arrange that.

38:08.698 --> 38:10.818
Come out. Now.

38:12.618 --> 38:14.178
NOW!

38:14.298 --> 38:16.218
We're coming, we're coming.

38:16.338 --> 38:17.698
Here's the guns.

38:18.858 --> 38:19.938
Here you go.

38:23.258 --> 38:24.498
Shit!

38:27.418 --> 38:30.418
So...

38:30.578 --> 38:33.458
You had the ambassador kill
the general of your country.

38:33.618 --> 38:35.658
You need to clear that up for me
before we die.

38:38.138 --> 38:41.458
I follow orders, as you do.

38:41.578 --> 38:43.538
Well, in that case...

38:43.658 --> 38:46.138
I want to meet your boss.

38:46.258 --> 38:47.378
You will.

38:47.538 --> 38:50.458
Sorry?

38:53.538 --> 38:56.498
Bring them. Right.

38:56.618 --> 38:57.618
Not today.

39:05.458 --> 39:08.698
Whoo! Yeah!

39:10.058 --> 39:13.818
Let them fucking burn, Mikey!
Let them fucking burn!

39:16.098 --> 39:18.378
Mate, when a Bangkok tuk-tuk
is your go-to exfil plan,

39:18.538 --> 39:20.898
I seriously have to
question your tactical choices.

39:21.058 --> 39:24.258
This isn't just any tuk-tuk.
This is Benz' tuk-tuk.

39:24.378 --> 39:26.258
Benz, this is Mikey, my partner.

39:26.458 --> 39:29.578
Yeah, I'm best number one tuk-tuk
in Bangkok. Brilliant, mate, brilliant.

39:29.698 --> 39:31.738
Zero? Yeah, we are inbound.

39:31.938 --> 39:35.858
We've got the intel and took out the
entire meth shipment in the process.

39:36.018 --> 39:37.818
'Good. I'll brief you
when you get here.'

39:39.338 --> 39:40.778
What's Finn's ETA?

39:41.978 --> 39:44.138
Ten hours.

39:44.258 --> 39:45.498
Think I can make it?

39:47.098 --> 39:48.258
Do you want to?

39:48.378 --> 39:50.938
Of course I want to. He's my son.

39:54.098 --> 39:57.098
I'm thinking about taking
Julia along. What, for back-up?

39:57.258 --> 39:59.938
Something like that.
Things have been going real nice.

40:01.698 --> 40:04.538
Instant family! Good.

40:08.578 --> 40:12.738
Thanks, my man. Here.
Ah, you two very good together.

40:12.858 --> 40:14.138
Maybe you two get married, yeah?

40:14.338 --> 40:16.218
Yeah, well, your invite's
in the post.

40:16.378 --> 40:18.578
Which one of you will wear the dress?
He will. She will.

40:20.218 --> 40:21.698
It's Foster's assistant Lawan.

40:21.858 --> 40:24.378
Her file says her parents
are South Korean,

40:24.538 --> 40:27.178
but we have intel that says
her father is from the North.

40:27.298 --> 40:28.418
So she's involved in this?

40:28.578 --> 40:31.138
Well, someone's on the inside
feeding them intelligence.

40:32.538 --> 40:35.858
I'm so sorry.
You did what you had to do.

40:37.818 --> 40:41.818
No. After what I did, I deserved
to die in that explosion.

40:41.938 --> 40:44.618
Deserved? No.

40:46.578 --> 40:50.298
But you should have. It would
have been easier that way.

40:51.698 --> 40:53.698
What?

40:53.858 --> 40:57.818
Colonel Locke? It's Philip, please.
How are you holding up? Fine.

40:57.978 --> 41:00.898
We came to see your dad.
I could take you to see him. Hmm?

41:01.058 --> 41:04.058
No, thank you. Why doesn't Chloe
take me? We can talk.

41:04.178 --> 41:05.178
You want to come with us?

41:05.298 --> 41:06.338
Come on.

41:09.858 --> 41:13.458
What are they doing? Hmm?
Oh, that's nothing to worry about.

41:13.578 --> 41:14.778
Chloe, listen to me.

41:15.898 --> 41:18.818
Whatever anyone says about
your father in the days to come,

41:18.938 --> 41:20.258
he is one of the few men I know

41:20.418 --> 41:22.538
who still believes in honour.
You got that?

41:22.698 --> 41:25.618
I've thought about this moment
for a long time.

41:27.498 --> 41:33.218
In the dark hours, during dinners,
drinks, family outings,

41:33.338 --> 41:35.378
our life together...

41:37.738 --> 41:41.978
I wondered, Robin,
how I'd feel at the end of it all.

41:43.178 --> 41:46.178
I was even scared to think that,
at the final moment,

41:46.298 --> 41:47.858
the love that I claimed for you

41:48.018 --> 41:51.258
would turn itself
into something real.

41:51.378 --> 41:54.098
What are you saying?

41:55.538 --> 41:58.578
I suppose I'm almost disappointed.

42:00.618 --> 42:07.218
Because there's nothing there.
What's happening? I don't understand.

42:07.338 --> 42:08.498
I feel nothing at all.

42:12.778 --> 42:14.498
Why are you doing this?

42:14.618 --> 42:16.058
Because it is time.

42:17.258 --> 42:20.898
Better to be an ambassador's
widow than a wife.

42:21.018 --> 42:23.818
All the freedom without this.

42:25.938 --> 42:27.658
No, Mei...

42:27.778 --> 42:30.098
My name is not Mei.

42:30.218 --> 42:34.098
My name has never been Mei.

42:34.218 --> 42:36.378
For God's sake...

42:36.498 --> 42:37.978
No.

42:38.098 --> 42:40.138
For the sake of the humiliated

42:40.298 --> 42:43.058
and suffering people
of North Korea, Robin.

42:44.298 --> 42:45.578
For their sake.

42:57.538 --> 43:00.298
Somebody help me!

43:03.578 --> 43:07.058
Somebody help me!

43:07.178 --> 43:10.858
Dad? Dad!

43:10.978 --> 43:12.538
No! No! Chloe...

43:12.658 --> 43:14.338
Dad, no, no!

43:14.458 --> 43:16.178
No, please!
