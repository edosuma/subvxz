WEBVTT

00:06.651 --> 00:09.319
- This never gets old.
- Why are you doing this?

00:09.388 --> 00:11.329
Because this job is
incredibly boring.

00:11.398 --> 00:13.994
So, Kelly, do you,
like, hate Amy now?

00:14.063 --> 00:15.095
What? No.

00:15.164 --> 00:17.573
This was before I even
started working here...

00:17.642 --> 00:19.377
- Yes.
- And... and it was just a kiss.

00:19.432 --> 00:21.643
Yes, exactly.
Thank you, Kelly.

00:21.712 --> 00:22.746
Uh-oh...

00:22.815 --> 00:25.236
Looks like we got ourselves
a catfight.

00:25.305 --> 00:26.699
Amy frenched her man,

00:26.768 --> 00:28.573
and now they're gonna
throw down.

00:28.642 --> 00:30.394
How did you get there from...

00:37.228 --> 00:42.119
<font color=#FF00FF>*SUPERSTORE*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 03    Episode 15
</font> Episode Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"Amnesty"</font>

00:44.374 --> 00:46.473
So, then I go,
"I'm undocumented,"

00:46.542 --> 00:48.377
and then Jeff goes,
"that's why you dumped me?"

00:48.519 --> 00:51.137
And I go, "yeah,"
and he goes, "whoa,"

00:51.206 --> 00:52.542
And I go, "mm-hmm."

00:52.611 --> 00:55.456
- And what'd he go?
- He was... Weird.

00:55.745 --> 00:57.994
He said he didn't know
what to do and he just left.

00:58.063 --> 00:59.190
I mean, what if he hates me?

00:59.259 --> 01:02.243
- He doesn't hate you.
- He might.

01:02.335 --> 01:04.090
For all I know,
he's reported me by now.

01:04.159 --> 01:06.097
I'm sure he didn't.
If he did, then,

01:06.175 --> 01:07.606
You know,
a bunch of guys in uniform

01:07.675 --> 01:09.431
would've busted in here by now
all like,

01:09.500 --> 01:10.892
"everyone, down on the ground!

01:10.961 --> 01:12.931
Black-bag that guy
and throw him in the van."

01:13.000 --> 01:14.798
Soldiers would pop
out of the ceiling,

01:14.867 --> 01:16.378
and just start
pounding on you,

01:16.456 --> 01:18.088
like, knee to the face,
knee to the head,

01:18.157 --> 01:19.696
Crotch-punch, crotch-punch!

01:19.765 --> 01:22.118
And then, you'd probably
get sent to guantanamo.

01:22.187 --> 01:23.220
Uh-huh.

01:25.095 --> 01:26.251
Probably.

01:26.723 --> 01:28.485
Man, how weird are sponges?

01:31.512 --> 01:33.142
You guys looking for condoms?

01:34.334 --> 01:36.563
- They're right here.
- Shut up, Corey.

01:36.720 --> 01:38.790
You know I have the power
to fire you.

01:39.337 --> 01:41.360
- Do you?
- I don't know.

01:41.429 --> 01:42.751
I'm just so annoyed
with everybody

01:42.820 --> 01:44.368
and this stupid video.

01:44.437 --> 01:45.556
It'll pass.

01:45.660 --> 01:48.602
You remember Robin
with that whole sexting thing?

01:48.748 --> 01:50.415
Nobody even mentions it
anymore.

01:50.554 --> 01:52.321
Robin killed himself.

01:52.390 --> 01:53.509
Oh...

01:54.344 --> 01:56.478
- Still, though.
- Uh-oh.

01:56.547 --> 01:58.649
Back to the scene of the crime,
you guys.

01:58.854 --> 02:03.276
That's... ♪ Pom, pom..♪ porn music,
it's not "seinfeld."

02:03.345 --> 02:05.181
We get it. Point taken.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.735
- Yeah, you really zinged us.
- You really zinged each other.

02:07.970 --> 02:09.798
You should write
for Craig Ferguson.

02:09.910 --> 02:11.732
- Just ignore it.
- That's what I'm doing.

02:11.801 --> 02:13.571
You guys looking
for the condoms?

02:13.640 --> 02:15.001
Corey already said that.

02:15.316 --> 02:18.032
Hey, corey,
you stole my condom joke.

02:20.194 --> 02:21.483
I just keep thinking about

02:21.552 --> 02:23.460
Jonah and Amy
kissing each other.

02:23.553 --> 02:24.975
Okay...
are you imagining

02:25.044 --> 02:26.375
that you're the Jonah
or you're the Amy?

02:26.443 --> 02:28.850
What? No.
I mean, Amy was married.

02:28.919 --> 02:30.387
I thought they were
both good people,

02:30.456 --> 02:32.127
and then... and then they...
they still wound up

02:32.196 --> 02:33.262
committing adultery.

02:33.331 --> 02:34.691
I don't know
why you're so shocked.

02:34.760 --> 02:36.550
People are basically
just monsters hiding behind

02:36.619 --> 02:38.019
the thin veneer
of social convention.

02:38.088 --> 02:40.413
Oh, come on.
I mean, uh, yeah, sure,

02:40.482 --> 02:42.264
there's a few naughty nathans
out there,

02:42.302 --> 02:44.502
But most people
are basically good.

02:44.571 --> 02:45.760
I watch security footage

02:45.829 --> 02:47.535
of people who don't know
they're on camera.

02:47.604 --> 02:49.260
Do you have any idea
how many customers

02:49.329 --> 02:51.010
have taken poops
on the floor of the store.

02:51.079 --> 02:53.331
- Because they think they're alone?
- I don't wanna know!

02:54.129 --> 02:56.104
- Is it zero?
- 17.

02:56.456 --> 02:58.127
Well, that's on me
for asking.

02:58.196 --> 02:59.565
People are monsters.

02:59.620 --> 03:00.996
Take away the threat
of punishment,

03:01.065 --> 03:03.534
and you'd be horrified by
what people admitted to doing.

03:04.565 --> 03:07.559
One of you has committed
a serious malfeasance,

03:07.628 --> 03:09.558
and I'm not talking
about Amy's adultery.

03:09.627 --> 03:12.030
All right,
"adultery" is a strong word.

03:12.099 --> 03:13.129
Heck yeah it is.

03:13.198 --> 03:15.207
What I'm talking about
is something else.

03:15.276 --> 03:17.276
This is a fireable offense.

03:17.518 --> 03:20.112
However, we're giving
that person one chance.

03:20.181 --> 03:22.449
You come forward today,
admit what you did,

03:22.518 --> 03:23.737
and we will forget everything.

03:23.806 --> 03:26.237
Okay, but how do we know
if the thing that we did

03:26.354 --> 03:28.230
Is the thing
you're talking about?

03:28.299 --> 03:30.431
That's why anyone
who comes to us today

03:30.524 --> 03:32.174
and admits to doing
something wrong

03:32.243 --> 03:34.391
will be granted full amnesty.

03:34.509 --> 03:35.667
How do we know
if we tell you something,

03:35.735 --> 03:38.112
you're not gonna,
you know, call corporate

03:38.181 --> 03:40.955
- Or the government or something?
- Yeah, sounds like a trap.

03:41.024 --> 03:43.641
No, I promise,
you will not be punished,

03:43.743 --> 03:46.806
I swear on the...
On the grave of my father.

03:48.492 --> 03:49.805
I swear on my birds.

03:49.915 --> 03:51.268
- Okay.
- Oh, wow.

03:51.337 --> 03:54.106
- She does love birds.
- Yeah.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:03.485 --> 04:05.318
What do you think
someone did?

04:05.643 --> 04:07.712
- I don't know.
- Who do you think did it?

04:07.781 --> 04:09.227
Still don't know.

04:09.304 --> 04:11.116
- When do you think it even...
- I don't have

04:11.227 --> 04:13.516
any more information than
you do.

04:14.225 --> 04:16.079
Man, I just wish I had known
that they were

04:16.149 --> 04:18.375
giving out amnesty.
I would've broken a rule.

04:18.498 --> 04:19.640
Hold on a second...

04:19.772 --> 04:21.992
We have till the end of the day
to confess, right?

04:22.060 --> 04:23.110
Yeah.

04:23.179 --> 04:25.625
I think we may have stumbled
onto a "purge" type situation.

04:25.731 --> 04:28.399
We can break one rule today
with no consequences.

04:28.468 --> 04:30.750
Oh... Like,
we could wear hats.

04:30.844 --> 04:32.047
That's against dress code.

04:32.116 --> 04:33.742
Okay, so you could do
anything you want,

04:33.811 --> 04:35.274
and you wanna waste it
on a hat?

04:35.343 --> 04:38.511
Okay, um...
How 'bout we steal a boat?

04:38.580 --> 04:39.922
Well, we don't sell boats,

04:39.991 --> 04:41.375
But I like that
you're thinking bigger.

04:41.443 --> 04:43.170
Right.
Also, I just remembered,

04:43.239 --> 04:44.481
I get kinda seasick,

04:44.550 --> 04:46.427
So the boat thing is
definitely a no-go.

04:46.496 --> 04:48.671
Okay, well, we were never
gonna do the boat thing,

04:48.740 --> 04:50.287
- But cool.
- Okay.

04:50.356 --> 04:52.443
Hey, Jeff, um, third call.

04:52.512 --> 04:54.592
Just still really wanting
to see how you were feeling

04:54.661 --> 04:56.944
about the whole
undocumented thing,

04:57.013 --> 04:58.810
or if you're mad at me or not,

04:58.998 --> 05:00.568
of if you told anyone
or didn't,

05:00.637 --> 05:01.841
or would or wouldn't.

05:01.910 --> 05:03.138
I...

05:03.640 --> 05:06.326
Sorry, this weird lady's
looking at me.

05:06.473 --> 05:07.732
Well, it's been over an hour

05:07.801 --> 05:10.502
and not one employee
has confessed,

05:10.571 --> 05:12.509
and I found a dollar
on the floor,

05:12.578 --> 05:15.193
- So eat peas.
- Ooh, an American dollar?

05:15.262 --> 05:16.983
It's all cryptocurrency now,
ya dino.

05:17.052 --> 05:18.662
Can someone please
open a register?

05:18.731 --> 05:20.186
I have kind of
a shrimp emergency.

05:20.255 --> 05:21.593
All the registers
should be open.

05:21.662 --> 05:23.115
Well, I'm not being dramatic.

05:23.279 --> 05:24.943
My wife is gonna murder me.

05:25.599 --> 05:27.076
Where is everyone?

05:27.591 --> 05:30.404
All right,
let's all take a number.

05:30.522 --> 05:32.193
We're gonna get to everyone.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.986
There's just so many of you.

05:37.102 --> 05:40.386
So, I um... I might have done
something wrong.

05:40.455 --> 05:41.534
But, um, I'm not sure

05:41.603 --> 05:43.292
If it's the same thing
you guys are talking about.

05:43.361 --> 05:45.334
Well, why don't you just
tell us what it is?

05:45.403 --> 05:46.652
Then we'll tell you
if your thing

05:46.720 --> 05:47.945
is the same thing
we're talking about.

05:48.013 --> 05:50.628
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, or, uh...

05:50.697 --> 05:52.472
why don't you tell me
your thing first,

05:52.541 --> 05:55.601
Then I'll say if it's
the same thing as... My thing?

05:55.670 --> 05:56.772
I mean, that sounds
better to me.

05:56.840 --> 05:58.905
How 'bout this, you tell us
the first letter of your thing,

05:58.973 --> 06:00.894
and then we'll know
if we're on the same page.

06:01.138 --> 06:02.513
Okay, fine.

06:03.505 --> 06:06.579
- Um, the letter "U"?
- Yes, "U."

06:06.648 --> 06:08.896
The thing we know about
also starts with "U."

06:08.965 --> 06:10.179
Okay, now give me
the second letter,

06:10.247 --> 06:11.200
and then we can just
go back and forth.

06:11.269 --> 06:13.303
- Just tell us what you know!
- You tell me what you know!

06:13.371 --> 06:14.405
Utah!

06:15.138 --> 06:17.997
Hey. What are you doing?

06:18.099 --> 06:19.474
Eating my lunch.

06:19.646 --> 06:21.630
Trying to stay away
from all the looks

06:21.699 --> 06:23.178
- and the comments and...
- Yeah.

06:23.247 --> 06:26.044
kinda tired of telling people
to mind their own business.

06:26.234 --> 06:28.188
So, I know this may
come as a surprise,

06:28.288 --> 06:30.866
but I actually got teased a lot
in middle school.

06:30.935 --> 06:31.945
No.

06:32.014 --> 06:34.022
Yeah, I don't know
if it was the rattail

06:34.091 --> 06:35.451
or the eighth grade
talent show

06:35.520 --> 06:37.087
where I did
a bossa nova rendition

06:37.156 --> 06:39.159
of "material girl"
on Alto Sax...

06:39.228 --> 06:40.683
That. It was that.

06:40.752 --> 06:43.066
But... the moment
I stopped fighting it

06:43.135 --> 06:45.831
and... and actually just
laughed along with them,

06:45.900 --> 06:47.753
- It wasn't fun for them anymore.
- Mm.

06:47.822 --> 06:49.620
They started teasing
this fat kid instead,

06:49.689 --> 06:52.636
which, long story short,
he's a male model now.

06:52.730 --> 06:55.898
Wow. You're really
the hero of that story.

06:55.990 --> 06:57.431
- I guess so.
- Uh-oh,

06:57.500 --> 07:00.657
hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

07:01.439 --> 07:03.024
What is that?

07:03.608 --> 07:04.798
Sex.

07:04.867 --> 07:07.032
No, it's not.

07:07.178 --> 07:09.399
I think you mean this.

07:11.322 --> 07:13.634
Oh, like this?
Yeah, there you go.

07:13.703 --> 07:14.884
Oh...

07:16.081 --> 07:17.204
This is nice.

07:17.376 --> 07:18.556
Okay, so, I'm the one

07:18.625 --> 07:20.268
Who's been stealing
the shopping carts,

07:20.337 --> 07:21.424
uh, but they're not for me.

07:21.493 --> 07:22.720
I give 'em to the homeless.

07:22.789 --> 07:25.532
- Tha... that's not too bad!
- I just give 'em the carts.

07:25.632 --> 07:27.797
They do the battling
on their own.

07:28.154 --> 07:29.679
What? Battling?

07:29.748 --> 07:31.383
I've been smoking weed
in the stock room

07:31.452 --> 07:33.868
- on wednesdays and fridays.
- Right under our noses. - What?

07:33.937 --> 07:35.110
- How awful.
- And on Mondays

07:35.179 --> 07:36.868
and Thursdays,
I just drink.

07:36.937 --> 07:38.079
And on Saturdays,

07:38.148 --> 07:40.280
I go to the cinnabon
and go nuts.

07:40.386 --> 07:42.857
- It's so good.
- I stole a pack

07:42.926 --> 07:44.856
of sour cherry bubblicious.

07:44.925 --> 07:47.435
- Well, that's not too bad.
- I liked the sour cherry,

07:47.504 --> 07:51.895
because it reminded me of
a jollytime zabra-dabra.

07:51.964 --> 07:55.866
My uncle Frank worked
for the jollytime factory.

07:55.935 --> 07:57.986
It's this new web series
thing I'm working on.

07:58.055 --> 08:00.918
The elevator pitch is
bum fights on crack.

08:00.987 --> 08:02.935
So, you know how me
and Carol hate each other...

08:03.004 --> 08:05.700
Well, I hate her.
Actually, she looks up to me.

08:05.839 --> 08:08.540
Anyway, I paid four different
guys to come into the store

08:08.612 --> 08:11.215
And ask her out
and then never show up.

08:11.284 --> 08:12.497
Nice.

08:12.737 --> 08:14.527
I've been doing things
to Sandra's lunch.

08:14.596 --> 08:16.668
♪♪

08:16.737 --> 08:19.137
An electrical spark
at the factory

08:19.206 --> 08:21.074
ignited the corn starch,

08:21.143 --> 08:24.887
Causing a big explosion
on the third floor...

08:24.948 --> 08:26.676
maybe it was the fourth floor.

08:26.745 --> 08:28.584
What floor did
uncle Frank work on?

08:28.653 --> 08:30.231
- The fourth floor!
- No!

08:30.300 --> 08:31.590
- Oh, gosh.
- Yes.

08:31.692 --> 08:33.239
So, you film homeless people

08:33.308 --> 08:34.761
smashing each other
with our carts?

08:34.831 --> 08:36.590
Sometimes, I'll just
give one of 'em a cart

08:36.644 --> 08:39.075
and the other a stick
or a trashcan lid.

08:39.246 --> 08:40.347
It's barbaric.

08:40.429 --> 08:42.145
What is happening
in this store?

08:42.214 --> 08:44.692
Aw, it's not just this store,
it's the whole world.

08:44.761 --> 08:47.052
Now, you just keep
that same face right there...

08:47.121 --> 08:48.387
Huh?

08:48.548 --> 08:50.016
That is going on my wall

08:50.085 --> 08:52.739
right next to the picture of me
with the guy who played balki.

08:52.825 --> 08:54.137
Bronson Pinchot.

08:54.206 --> 08:55.686
I don't know
what you're saying to me.

08:56.505 --> 08:58.934
..."not allowed."

08:59.088 --> 09:01.092
Okay, we're not
just hatting this.

09:01.161 --> 09:03.176
There has to be something
in-between maiming someone

09:03.245 --> 09:04.872
and putting on a fedora.

"'I for one am proud of
this Mexican's achievements.'"

09:13.847 --> 09:15.918
Most of this stuff
is stuff I don't wanna do

09:15.987 --> 09:17.348
Or doesn't even apply.

09:17.443 --> 09:20.333
"A female employee's skirt
shall start below the knee,

09:20.402 --> 09:22.223
And her bosom shall be
fully covered"?

09:22.292 --> 09:24.215
- That's a rule?
- Yeah.

09:24.284 --> 09:26.090
Most days,
I don't even wear underwear,

09:26.159 --> 09:28.208
Mainly 'cause mentioning that
gets me free donuts

09:28.277 --> 09:29.958
From whoever's working cafÃ©.

09:30.345 --> 09:31.950
Couldn't you just
lie about that?

09:32.019 --> 09:33.278
They would know.

09:34.608 --> 09:36.114
I would know.

09:52.731 --> 09:53.801
What?

09:53.847 --> 09:56.348
Or wait...
She has a daughter, right?

09:56.709 --> 09:59.606
Oh, she loves that daughter.

09:59.900 --> 10:02.606
Yeah, I... I like
her daughter too.

17:15.174 --> 17:16.902
We've... we've all, you know...

17:17.017 --> 17:19.117
And... and... and besides,
you know, I've...

17:19.417 --> 17:21.637
I'm with... I've got...
I'm with, um...

17:21.705 --> 17:23.042
- Kelly.
- I'm with Kelly.

17:23.112 --> 17:24.851
Yeah, no, I... I...
I know your name, obviously.

17:24.920 --> 17:26.999
- Guys, this is amazing.
- Yeah.

17:27.068 --> 17:28.435
Yeah, I'm generally a cynic.

17:28.505 --> 17:30.859
But this? Wow.

17:30.928 --> 17:33.757
She didn't know
that he didn't know,

17:33.870 --> 17:37.070
And now he knows
that she knows ****

17:37.139 --> 17:38.678
We get it, Sandra.

17:40.881 --> 17:43.373
So the guys, I think
it should be with Kelly or Amy

17:43.442 --> 17:45.334
- I'm kind of team Amy now.
- Yeah.

17:45.403 --> 17:47.148
I'm with you.
I'm fully shipping them.

17:47.217 --> 17:48.553
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

17:48.622 --> 17:50.326
Oh, hey, Ame.

17:50.427 --> 17:51.475
'sup?

17:52.379 --> 17:54.905
Oh, hey, guys. What's up?

17:56.187 --> 17:58.909
We're... we're just having
normal workplace conversations.

17:58.978 --> 18:00.017
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

18:00.086 --> 18:00.919
- Mm-hmm.
- Sure.

18:00.987 --> 18:03.733
Yep. How are you doing
with everything?

18:03.802 --> 18:06.117
There it is. You know me.

18:06.186 --> 18:08.116
Struggling to keep it
in my pants.

18:08.185 --> 18:10.257
With Jonah roaming
around here somewhere,

18:10.326 --> 18:12.842
I'm just like,
"give it to me, Jonah."

18:12.911 --> 18:13.928
- that's a good one.
- Yep.

18:13.996 --> 18:15.452
- Mm-hmm.
- Yep,

18:15.521 --> 18:16.889
gonna go find him now

18:16.958 --> 18:19.530
And just, like, do him,
you know?

18:19.662 --> 18:22.725
Soft lines? More like
hard lines.

18:23.693 --> 18:24.866
Get it?

18:29.248 --> 18:31.162
Watching your
world view get shattered

18:31.231 --> 18:32.992
has been the highlight
of my year.

18:33.061 --> 18:34.756
And that includes meeting
that balki guy.

18:34.825 --> 18:36.898
- Bronson Pinchot.
- What does that mean?

18:36.967 --> 18:38.342
Hey, guys, I'm taking off.

18:38.411 --> 18:41.679
Garrett...
Let's get this over with.

18:42.011 --> 18:44.054
- Get what over with?
- What did you do?

18:44.123 --> 18:46.037
Did you make two nuns
fight a prostitute?

18:46.106 --> 18:49.100
- Broil a child?
- Nah, I didn't do anything.

18:49.219 --> 18:50.735
I'm very, very sorry to say,

18:50.804 --> 18:52.507
but, uh, I haven't
broken any rules.

18:52.576 --> 18:55.608
Really? So, you've never
gotten stoned at work

18:55.677 --> 18:57.944
Or... or hit golf balls
off the checkout?

18:58.100 --> 19:00.530
You've never taken
a video game home,

19:00.599 --> 19:03.341
Played it, repackaged it,
and put it back on the shelf?

19:03.410 --> 19:04.428
No.

19:04.497 --> 19:06.750
I mean, those are all things
I probably could've done,

19:06.819 --> 19:08.670
But... did not.

19:10.133 --> 19:13.334
Garrett...
You little rule follower.

19:14.966 --> 19:17.336
I found a good one!

19:20.073 --> 19:21.534
His ability to delude himself

19:21.602 --> 19:23.215
is the only impressive thing
about him.

19:23.284 --> 19:25.230
I think I was just
disoriented in the moment,

19:25.299 --> 19:27.870
but I am not cool
with him kissing my head.

19:28.528 --> 19:29.589
Hey.

19:30.651 --> 19:34.018
- Kelly.
- Uh... yes, I know your...

19:34.328 --> 19:39.026
Look, uh, I was just flustered,
you know, back there.

19:39.095 --> 19:41.636
Yeah, sure.
Well, it's very flustering

19:41.705 --> 19:45.158
When you find out that the girl
you like likes you back.

19:45.227 --> 19:46.830
No, no, I just...

19:46.901 --> 19:48.947
Everything just got
blown out of proportion.

19:49.016 --> 19:50.229
Let me ask you this,

19:50.304 --> 19:53.033
If... if your crush had timed out
with Amy's crush,

19:53.102 --> 19:55.182
- would we be together right now?
- Yes.

19:55.263 --> 19:56.455
- Really?
- Really.

19:56.524 --> 19:59.358
Look, I don't want this whole
Amy thing to set us back.

19:59.427 --> 20:00.450
I wanna...

20:00.901 --> 20:03.565
I wanna move forward with you.

20:03.923 --> 20:05.423
Like move in together?

20:06.017 --> 20:08.638
Yeah.
Why not?

20:08.863 --> 20:10.514
I mean, if... if you want to.

20:10.583 --> 20:12.099
Do... do you want to?

20:12.168 --> 20:15.661
Do... well, sure, yeah.

20:16.083 --> 20:17.757
I mean, I would... yeah.

20:17.826 --> 20:18.826
Yeah, great, okay.

20:18.895 --> 20:20.983
Cool, then we're doing it.
We're... we're living together.

20:21.051 --> 20:22.051
Oh. Uh...
All right.

20:28.753 --> 20:30.300
Chad, it's Mateo.

20:30.369 --> 20:33.684
Do... I know I've said
some horrible things about you

20:33.753 --> 20:34.755
in the comments
of your instagram,

20:34.823 --> 20:36.667
but, you know,
I can't find Jeff,

20:36.845 --> 20:38.270
And I've been calling
the office...

20:38.339 --> 20:39.620
I quit my job.

20:40.573 --> 20:43.393
Uh, chad,
I'm gonna call you back.

20:43.462 --> 20:46.089
Uh, probably not, actually.

20:46.814 --> 20:49.346
Jeff...
You wanna get a drink?

20:51.362 --> 20:52.589
Sure.

20:54.229 --> 20:56.143
- Nice shirt.
- You think?

20:56.416 --> 20:57.572
It's the one matt damon wore

20:57.641 --> 20:59.238
at the end of
"the bourne identity."

20:59.838 --> 21:01.380
that's so cool.

21:01.449 --> 21:02.696
Right on.

21:03.397 --> 21:05.731
I can't do it...
