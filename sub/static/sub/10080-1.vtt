00:49.950 --> 00:54.240
{y:i}John Wilson.
{y:i}A violent man given to violent action.

00:54.660 --> 00:59.250
{y:i}Some ascribed his wild and troubled life
{y:i}to his personal mania for self-destruction.

00:59.460 --> 01:02.580
{y:i}These generalizations always seemed
{y:i}inaccurate to me.

01:02.880 --> 01:05.379
{y:i}That's why I had to
write all this about John.

01:05.500 --> 01:08.130
{y:i}A brilliant, screw-you-all
type filmmaker...

01:08.210 --> 01:12.800
{y: i}...who continually violated all the unwritten
{y: i}laws of the motion picture business...

01:12.890 --> 01:18.140
{y: i}...yet had the magic, almost divine ability
{y:i}to always land on his feet.

01:34.910 --> 01:36.990
Mr. Verrill?
Hello, I'm Miss Wilding.

01:37.200 --> 01:39.000
- How are you?
- Did you have a good flight?

01:39.080 --> 01:41.910
- Wonderful. Thank you.
- Mr. Wilson is expecting you.

01:52.220 --> 01:55.260
- How was Switzerland?
- Switzerland? Fine.

01:55.430 --> 01:57.010
Eggerton Gardens, please.

01:57.640 --> 01:58.890
Yes, ma'am.

01:59.520 --> 02:02.020
- I thought he was at Claridge's.
- He was.

02:02.440 --> 02:04.020
He's got a house now.

02:04.190 --> 02:06.810
One of his society friends
loaned it to him.

02:07.230 --> 02:08.900
You know what John is.

02:10.690 --> 02:12.780
I mean, Mr. Wilson.

02:37.890 --> 02:41.020
Hello, George. This is Mr. Verrill.
Is Mr. Wilson up yet?

02:41.140 --> 02:44.640
Oh, yes. He's been up hours.
Been riding.

02:45.730 --> 02:47.690
He's having his breakfast now.

03:12.300 --> 03:13.970
Come in.

03:23.270 --> 03:25.350
Mr. Verrill is here, Mr. Wilson.

03:28.980 --> 03:30.650
- Pete!
- Johnny!

03:30.860 --> 03:32.190
For God's sake!

03:33.030 --> 03:35.030
- How the hell are you?
- All right.

03:35.240 --> 03:36.780
Well, you're looking good, kid.

03:37.030 --> 03:40.240
- What have you been up to?
- Skiing and sitting in the sun.

03:40.450 --> 03:41.700
Isn't that swell?

03:41.910 --> 03:44.200
- I missed you, kid.
- I missed you too, John.

03:44.290 --> 03:45.450
- Same old Pete.
- Yeah.

03:45.660 --> 03:47.330
- Care for some coffee?
- I'm fine.

03:47.540 --> 03:49.630
- This is some joint you got.
- Isn't it?

03:49.710 --> 03:52.550
- Did you get a load of the living room?
- Did I ever!

03:52.750 --> 03:55.260
Isn't it the most hideous thing?
I'm crazy about it.

03:55.380 --> 03:59.430
Miss Wilding, you can get the hell
out of here. There's no work today.

04:00.390 --> 04:02.470
Well, what do you think of this outfit?

04:02.640 --> 04:05.890
Hey, that's some getup
you got there, Johnny.

04:06.100 --> 04:07.480
Of course it is.

04:07.560 --> 04:09.730
Now, what about you?
What about the book?

04:09.980 --> 04:12.060
I didn't get very much done on the book.

04:12.230 --> 04:14.320
Why? Or would you prefer
not to talk about it?

04:14.570 --> 04:16.529
I don't mind. I just couldn't get started.

04:16.740 --> 04:19.160
An then when I did,
I got hooked up with some dame.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.950
- Hell, isn't it?
- It sure is.

04:22.070 --> 04:25.580
And once it's over, you can't figure out
why it all seemed so damn important.

04:25.830 --> 04:28.000
There's nothing tougher
than trying to remember...

04:28.210 --> 04:30.290
why you chased a dame
once you've had her.

04:30.420 --> 04:33.840
Yeah, I'll say. And I didn't get
much skiing done because of her.

04:33.920 --> 04:37.920
Well, that's a shame. I think I've got
the cure for that, though: Africa.

04:38.090 --> 04:40.720
You come down there with me
and you work on this script.

04:40.840 --> 04:45.180
- You really think that's gonna help me?
- Even if it doesn't, you've got to do it.

04:45.390 --> 04:49.890
There are times when you can't wonder whether
it's the right or wrong thing to do.

04:50.020 --> 04:53.650
Not for guys like you and me, kid.
You just gotta pack up and go.

04:56.980 --> 04:58.780
I gotta get started on this book.

04:58.860 --> 05:01.160
If you didn't write it before,
you weren't ready.

05:01.280 --> 05:03.570
- You think so?
- I know so.

05:03.780 --> 05:05.660
Well, when do you plan on leaving?

05:06.040 --> 05:09.910
In a week or 10 days. We'll work here
and then we'll get our shots and take off.

05:10.120 --> 05:13.670
- And who's gonna be in this picture?
- We have Phil Duncan and Kay Gibson.

05:13.790 --> 05:16.380
That's good. How long are you
planning on staying there?

05:16.590 --> 05:19.630
Oh, four or five months.
Long enough to make a picture.

05:19.800 --> 05:22.340
- And have ourselves a safari.
- Safari?

05:22.550 --> 05:24.800
Yeah, haven't you ever wanted
to shoot an elephant?

05:25.010 --> 05:27.850
- No, I don't think so, John.
- Well, a lion or a buffalo.

05:27.970 --> 05:30.060
This is a safari, kid. The real thing.

05:30.230 --> 05:32.560
- Who's gonna pay for all this?
- Don't worry.

05:32.770 --> 05:34.730
What's your financial situation?

05:34.860 --> 05:37.230
- It remains unchanged.
- So you're broke?

05:37.730 --> 05:40.490
Depends on what you call broke.
I owe a quarter million.

05:40.650 --> 05:43.070
- Quarter of a million?
- Closer to 300,000.

05:43.280 --> 05:47.870
- $300,000, John, and you're not worried?
- I think about it now and then.

05:48.290 --> 05:50.580
- Do you see a way out?
- This picture.

05:50.790 --> 05:52.750
Now do you see why
I want to go to Africa?

05:52.870 --> 05:56.340
I've got nothing else to lose.
Even if a lion or a buffalo gets me...

05:56.420 --> 05:58.590
my last minute on earth
will be a happy one.

05:59.260 --> 06:02.880
I'll just think of my creditors when they
find out I've been eaten alive...

06:03.090 --> 06:06.010
and it'll all seem worthwhile.

06:06.350 --> 06:09.350
Okay, okay, John. How about a script?

06:09.970 --> 06:13.020
There's one around here somewhere.
We don't have a title yet.

06:13.100 --> 06:16.230
It's called African Trader
or African something.

06:16.440 --> 06:17.900
Miss Wilding?

06:21.780 --> 06:24.280
Where's a copy of that goddamned script?

06:24.450 --> 06:25.950
I haven't seen it, John.

06:26.120 --> 06:29.790
Then find it. What kind of a secretary
are you? What do you do all day?

06:29.990 --> 06:32.620
I've been typing your letters
and answering the telephone.

06:32.790 --> 06:34.580
- Balls.
- I have.

06:34.790 --> 06:37.080
You were competent
when you first got here.

06:37.290 --> 06:40.840
Now you just hang around all day
spying for Paul Landers.

06:41.050 --> 06:44.589
It's not true. I don't spy for anybody.
Especially Mr. Landers.

06:44.590 --> 06:45.970
Find the script, then.

06:46.050 --> 06:48.890
We have a meeting with Landers
and his money men in an hour.

06:48.970 --> 06:50.430
Right.

06:51.470 --> 06:53.980
- Paul Landers is producing this?
- That's right.

06:54.190 --> 06:56.480
And you know why I agreed
to work with him again?

06:56.690 --> 06:57.810
No.

06:58.560 --> 07:01.480
Because it's the wrong thing to do.

07:04.740 --> 07:07.820
- I'm so glad to see you, Pete.
- It's good to see you, Paul.

07:08.070 --> 07:11.290
- You can save all our lives.
- How's that?

07:11.490 --> 07:14.620
- The monster. I think he's losing his mind.
- He's in fine shape.

07:14.830 --> 07:18.170
You've only been with him half a day.
You don't know what he's been like.

07:18.380 --> 07:20.670
He's almost killed the deal five times.

07:20.880 --> 07:23.169
The only reason it's still alive
is because of me.

07:23.170 --> 07:26.090
- He wants to go to Africa.
- Paul, how the hell are you?

07:26.300 --> 07:29.510
Johnny boy! Did you have a good day?
Get a lot done?

07:29.760 --> 07:32.560
Hell, no. But Pete and I
did have a nice chat.

07:32.770 --> 07:35.270
- What do you think of the script?
- I haven't read it yet.

07:35.480 --> 07:38.190
- I think it's awfully good.
- You do?

07:38.400 --> 07:41.860
Well, it's a shame you don't know
a damn thing about it.

07:42.980 --> 07:44.940
- You see?
- He's always been like that.

07:45.190 --> 07:46.610
No, he's worse. He's insane.

07:46.860 --> 07:50.280
In a well-ordered society,
he'd be in a straitjacket right now.

07:50.910 --> 07:54.120
Where the question of color is concerned,
it's an extra expense.

07:54.370 --> 07:56.460
As far as I'm concerned,
of questionable value.

07:56.620 --> 07:58.830
- I quite agree.
- Well, I don't.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.800
Color's worth a million dollars
at the box office.

08:02.880 --> 08:05.090
Well, that's not important.

08:05.210 --> 08:10.089
What I'm trying to find out from Basil is
how much color complicates our operation.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.890
Well, I'm afraid it does, John.

08:11.970 --> 08:15.310
The camera is much heavier.
There are many more lighting problems.

08:15.520 --> 08:19.060
I'm telling you, color is essential
to the success of this venture.

08:19.270 --> 08:22.480
I'm not concerned with the success
of the venture at this moment.

08:22.730 --> 08:24.480
I just don't want to get bogged down.

08:24.690 --> 08:26.990
- Bogged down?
- Bogged down?

08:27.190 --> 08:31.490
Yes, I know how easy it is to get bogged
down with a company on location.

08:32.409 --> 08:35.539
- Have you ever been bogged down, John?
- No.

08:35.750 --> 08:38.870
- Then why bring it up?
- I think it's a very valid point.

08:39.080 --> 08:40.120
Well, I don't.

08:40.830 --> 08:42.419
Well, of course you don't, Paul.

08:42.630 --> 08:45.760
Because while we're in Africa,
sweating and killing ourselves...

08:45.960 --> 08:48.590
you'll be in Paris sending out memos.

08:48.670 --> 08:51.090
That's not true.
I'll be there in Africa with you.

08:51.180 --> 08:52.640
Like hell you will.

08:52.850 --> 08:57.350
If the picture was shot in a river in England,
and the second unit sent out to Africa...

08:57.520 --> 09:00.270
then the risk of using color
would be greatly minimized.

09:00.350 --> 09:04.110
- That would be with some other director.
- We have already discussed that.

09:04.520 --> 09:06.190
Oh, we have, have we?

09:07.530 --> 09:11.280
John, could I talk to you
in the bedroom for a moment?

09:14.620 --> 09:19.250
- What's this bullshit about another director?
- You know I wouldn't do that to you.

09:19.410 --> 09:22.460
You'd sell your mother
down the river to make a deal.

09:22.880 --> 09:26.630
What the hell is the matter with you, John?
Do you want to kill this project?

09:27.130 --> 09:29.220
No. No, I don't.

09:29.340 --> 09:34.350
Then why bring up the possibility of bogging
down? You scared the bejesus out of them!

09:34.970 --> 09:38.810
Then telling them that you'd quit if the
picture wasn't made in Africa. Good God!

09:39.060 --> 09:42.480
If one frame of this picture
is shot in England, I will quit.

09:42.690 --> 09:44.650
But it won't be.

09:44.770 --> 09:47.820
But you discussed it behind my back,
you son of a bitch.

09:47.980 --> 09:53.320
I didn't mention it because there isn't
a chance it could be done that way.

09:53.820 --> 09:56.160
You'll guarantee that, I suppose?

09:56.240 --> 09:59.160
Yes, goddamn it. I guarantee it!

10:00.080 --> 10:02.580
Well, your guarantee doesn't mean
a damn thing to me.

10:02.830 --> 10:06.880
I'm not gonna make some fake,
crappy mess just to please you.

10:07.090 --> 10:10.630
So I don't care if this picture's shot
in black and white or sepia tone...

10:10.760 --> 10:13.340
or we have to make
the whole damn thing in animation.

10:13.470 --> 10:15.850
Pete and I are going to Africa.

10:26.270 --> 10:30.530
- What's the effective range of this thing?
- About 100 yards, sir. Not much more.

10:30.780 --> 10:33.280
That's plenty for your buff
and your elephant.

10:33.450 --> 10:35.110
They kill them at 20 yards, kid.

10:35.360 --> 10:38.580
Well, even closer than that sometimes,
so they tell me.

10:38.780 --> 10:42.540
Of course, I've never been to Africa,
but this man has.

10:42.750 --> 10:44.210
Makes for invaluable reading.

10:44.420 --> 10:46.920
John Taylor.
{y:i}Big Game and Big Game Rifles.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.460
- We'll need two of these.
- We'll take two of these rifles right here...

10:50.670 --> 10:53.720
and two of the smaller ones,
the Mannlichers 256.

10:53.880 --> 10:56.090
And that's to shoot for the pot,
so to speak.

10:56.220 --> 11:00.470
- And then one 12-gauge shotgun.
- Always a useful thing to have along, sir.

11:00.680 --> 11:02.140
And cartridges, of course.

11:02.230 --> 11:07.150
- How many rounds, sir?
- Two hundred. Two hundred per weapon.

11:07.360 --> 11:09.860
- Planning to be away quite a while, sir.
- Yes.

11:09.940 --> 11:13.190
And Sunrise Films will send you the check.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.120
John! Be careful!

11:21.540 --> 11:25.080
Irene. For God's sake,
what are you doing here?

11:30.290 --> 11:32.380
You told me to meet you here.

11:32.590 --> 11:35.510
We had an appointment.
Drinks and dinner.

11:37.930 --> 11:40.010
- I dressed.
- Yes.

11:41.140 --> 11:45.020
Well, it plain slipped my mind.
Irene Saunders, this is Pete Verrill.

11:45.180 --> 11:46.270
Hello.

11:46.850 --> 11:49.480
I admired your last book enormously.

11:49.690 --> 11:51.770
I'm a writer too.

11:51.980 --> 11:55.610
John's promised to listen to an idea
I had for a film this evening.

11:55.740 --> 11:57.410
I do hope you'll join us.

11:57.610 --> 12:01.580
You can give me a few pointers.
One writer to another.

12:07.710 --> 12:12.130
It's about a dog. A puppy dog.
He's the hero, the star.

12:12.840 --> 12:16.590
Imagine, John, over the opening credits,
we'll see Horace.

12:16.720 --> 12:20.550
Wonderful, adorable dissolves
of Horace. In close-up. In long shot.

12:21.180 --> 12:23.890
Now, this is the part of the script
I'm not sure about.

12:23.970 --> 12:27.560
The censors might cut it.
It turns out that Horace is in heat.

12:27.730 --> 12:30.560
- Horace?
- It's a story of mistaken identity.

12:30.770 --> 12:34.320
You see, Horace has a twin. A bitch.
She's called Geraldine.

12:34.530 --> 12:39.410
Now, it's she that's in heat.
Isn't that a wonderful switch?

12:43.990 --> 12:50.369
We'll cut from the Hyde Park sequence, John,
to an early-morning shot of the river.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.040
The river.

12:53.090 --> 12:57.670
Horace is alone now. We dolly with him
as he trots slowly down a deserted street.

12:57.880 --> 13:00.380
- He turns into Grosvenor...
- What are you doing here?

13:00.590 --> 13:03.010
I have found a copy of the script.

13:04.140 --> 13:07.350
- I hope you like it as much as I do.
- I'm sure I will.

13:07.480 --> 13:09.270
Peter! Please.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.650
You must hear the ending.

13:11.850 --> 13:16.230
Horace is all alone. Now, we'll dolly with him
as he trots slowly down a deserted street.

13:16.360 --> 13:18.860
Now, from another angle...

13:19.030 --> 13:21.660
Geraldine can be seen
coming down Brook Street.

13:21.860 --> 13:24.580
She passes Claridge's,
then she enters the square.

13:25.280 --> 13:27.500
Suddenly, they see each other.

13:27.620 --> 13:30.210
Horace and Geraldine.

13:30.410 --> 13:34.290
There isn't a human being in sight. They
race toward each other! The music swells!

13:34.380 --> 13:39.380
Now, we hold the final picture
in an extreme long shot...

13:40.630 --> 13:43.640
as they meet...

13:44.390 --> 13:46.390
turn...

13:47.520 --> 13:49.390
and go off together.

13:54.190 --> 13:56.480
They've only just begun to live.

13:57.730 --> 13:59.190
Well, that's the end.

14:02.410 --> 14:04.320
They find each other.

14:08.370 --> 14:12.750
Well, isn't that something?
Isn't that something?

14:14.750 --> 14:16.290
Do you really like it?

14:17.550 --> 14:20.460
Well, darling, it's swell.

14:20.670 --> 14:23.180
Come on, we'll talk some more.

14:24.090 --> 14:25.680
Pete.

14:27.680 --> 14:30.680
If there's half as much love
in this old gal as there is talk...

14:30.890 --> 14:33.190
I may be dead in the morning.

14:42.450 --> 14:43.950
Hey, Johnny.

14:44.110 --> 14:45.780
- Morning.
- Morning.

14:46.620 --> 14:48.950
You look like you've been
run through the wringer.

14:49.120 --> 14:51.040
Just part of me.

14:52.040 --> 14:55.370
What's happening, kid?
What do you think of the script?

14:55.630 --> 14:57.790
Well, I'll tell you the truth. I like it.

14:57.880 --> 14:59.460
- I like it a lot.
- Good.

14:59.670 --> 15:03.970
It's original, it's exciting and it's moving.
I just have one little problem with it.

15:04.680 --> 15:06.140
The ending.

15:06.220 --> 15:09.680
- You don't like the ending?
- No, I didn't say I don't like the ending.

15:09.890 --> 15:13.140
I'm just not sure that it's the right one.

15:14.390 --> 15:17.400
Let me put it in Hollywood terms.
I think it's too downbeat.

15:17.610 --> 15:19.690
After everything
these two have gone through:

15:19.900 --> 15:23.240
They fought the river,
tropical storms, the Germans...

15:23.440 --> 15:28.160
And just when you've set the audience up
for a wonderfully comic ending...

15:28.240 --> 15:31.370
you blow the ship up and kill everybody.

15:31.790 --> 15:34.410
Well, Pete, there's an old saying:

15:34.580 --> 15:36.580
"God makes a man before he kills him."

15:36.790 --> 15:40.840
I've heard it, John. I've heard it.
But I don't think it applies in this case.

15:40.960 --> 15:43.460
You're beating the audience
over the head, John.

15:44.090 --> 15:47.510
People don't go to see pictures
to be lectured to.

15:47.760 --> 15:50.350
Tell me, Pete. Do you own
a percentage of this film?

15:50.550 --> 15:51.680
No.

15:52.220 --> 15:55.140
Then why are you so concerned
about the damn audience?

15:55.690 --> 15:58.270
Because we're in show business, John.

15:58.480 --> 16:02.650
Not me. And not you, either,
when we work together.

16:02.860 --> 16:04.610
You see, we're gods, Pete.

16:04.740 --> 16:08.489
Lousy little gods who control
the lives of the people we create.

16:08.490 --> 16:12.540
We sit up in some heavenly place
and decide whether they live or die...

16:12.660 --> 16:17.870
on the merits of what happens to them
in reel one, two, three, et cetera.

16:18.080 --> 16:20.380
And then we decide
if they have the right to live.

16:20.590 --> 16:23.380
And that's how we arrive at our ending.

16:23.630 --> 16:28.090
Well, that's what you say, John.
But I say I'm a swell god.

16:28.300 --> 16:31.850
I say they should live because of
everything they've gone through together.

16:32.050 --> 16:37.270
This world doesn't necessarily have to be
a hopeless and rotten place, John.

16:37.480 --> 16:41.230
We're not all destined and doomed to die
of radium poisoning.

16:41.440 --> 16:43.320
Now, I might be completely wrong...

16:45.480 --> 16:48.240
but that's what makes me a swell god.

16:48.320 --> 16:52.830
- That makes you a flea on an elephant's ass.
- Oh, balls to your pessimism.

16:54.160 --> 16:58.250
You know something? You're never gonna be
a good screenwriter, and you know why?

16:58.410 --> 17:00.630
No, John. Why don't you tell me why?

17:00.830 --> 17:04.670
Because you let 85 million popcorn eaters
pull you this way and that way.

17:04.800 --> 17:07.920
To write a movie, you must forget
anyone's ever going to see it.

17:08.010 --> 17:10.430
You're gonna make damn sure
nobody sees this one.

17:10.640 --> 17:14.510
Well, maybe I am. But I figure
there's two ways to live in this world.

17:14.680 --> 17:18.430
One is you can crawl and kiss ass
and write their happy endings...

17:18.560 --> 17:23.270
sign their long-term contracts and never
take a chance on anything and never fly...

17:23.440 --> 17:27.190
never leave Hollywood. Save all
your goddamn money, every cent of it.

17:27.440 --> 17:30.950
And then when you're a healthy-looking 50,
you die of a stroke...

17:31.070 --> 17:35.030
because whatever was wild in you
has eaten away the muscles of your heart.

17:35.240 --> 17:39.120
The other way is to let the chips
fall where they may.

17:39.290 --> 17:43.880
Refuse to sign their contracts and
tell off the guy who can cut your throat...

17:44.130 --> 17:47.460
and flatter the little guy
who's hanging by a thread that you hold.

17:47.630 --> 17:50.130
John, maybe you shouldn't be
in the picture business.

17:50.260 --> 17:53.180
Well, maybe you're right, kid.
Maybe I shouldn't.

17:53.390 --> 17:57.060
Maybe I should've wandered the planet
gambling on oil wells...

17:57.220 --> 18:00.479
or stolen diamonds
or pimped for maharajahs.

18:00.480 --> 18:03.310
Maybe you should've
but you know why you didn't?

18:03.400 --> 18:07.980
Because somewhere deep inside of you
is a small, tiny spark of hope.

18:08.190 --> 18:10.070
Hope, hell.

18:10.280 --> 18:15.280
I'll die broke in a downtown Los Angeles
flophouse. And I won't be bitter.

18:15.620 --> 18:19.580
I'll have contributed maybe five,
10 damn good pictures.

18:19.790 --> 18:23.080
They'll name a special Academy Award
for me. And you know something?

18:23.290 --> 18:27.380
All the wrong guys will get it.
And I'll be in hell, laughing my ass off.

18:29.550 --> 18:31.420
Romantic futility.

18:31.630 --> 18:34.470
- Your one true love.
- Nothing to be ashamed of, kid.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.350
No, no, no, I didn't say that.

18:36.550 --> 18:39.060
But I admit, you are right
about the ending, John.

18:39.270 --> 18:42.390
I think you should kill them all
and blow everything up!

18:43.100 --> 18:46.150
I knew you'd ultimately see it my way.

18:46.980 --> 18:48.770
Morning, boys.

18:48.860 --> 18:50.940
If it isn't the producer, right on cue.

18:51.070 --> 18:54.069
I have just come from a meeting...

18:54.070 --> 18:58.240
and I think the financial
deal is finally set.

18:58.370 --> 19:01.369
- Good. When do I get my take?
- Oh, you'll get it.

19:01.370 --> 19:04.620
- I'm glad to see you boys have been working.
- No, we're not working.

19:04.710 --> 19:07.210
We're just warming up,
doing some mental calisthenics.

19:08.130 --> 19:10.880
Well, if you take my advice,
you'll start with the ending.

19:11.170 --> 19:12.840
Oh, yeah?

19:13.050 --> 19:15.970
Now, look, Paul. Don't you go
interfering with the script.

19:16.090 --> 19:18.680
And don't try to influence
my writer, either.

19:18.890 --> 19:20.640
You're an obscene man.

19:20.890 --> 19:23.890
You witnessed the cultural disintegration
of central Europe...

19:24.100 --> 19:28.060
and you nevertheless persist on following
the same cheap, disastrous course...

19:28.270 --> 19:30.150
that led to Hitler over Europe...

19:30.360 --> 19:33.990
World War ll and the atomic bomb.

19:35.070 --> 19:37.450
Meaning the ending stays as it is.

19:38.280 --> 19:43.080
Except for one minor change. The Germans
kill you too. Over the end title.

19:46.500 --> 19:48.580
Do you have a coat
or something I could borrow?

19:48.790 --> 19:49.960
- Oh, Irene.
- Excuse me.

19:50.170 --> 19:51.630
I can't go out dressed like this.

19:51.840 --> 19:56.010
Irene, I'd like you to meet my partner.
Paul Landers, our producer.

19:56.090 --> 19:59.220
Irene has the most wonderful idea
for a film, Paul.

19:59.430 --> 20:02.060
Why don't you tell it to Paul
while Pete and I work?

20:02.180 --> 20:04.060
Start from the beginning, darling.

20:04.270 --> 20:07.770
It's about a dog. A puppy dog.
He's the hero, the star.

20:08.020 --> 20:09.270
The dog's name is Horace.

20:09.440 --> 20:11.940
Pete, I should've sent you back
to Switzerland!

20:12.480 --> 20:15.400
I love Paul. He's such a desperate man.

21:11.580 --> 21:15.460
- Are you coming to Africa with us, Peter?
- Yes, I am, Kay.

21:15.670 --> 21:19.930
Thank God. Did you hear that?
Peter's coming with us.

21:20.180 --> 21:23.510
At least we'll have one sane,
reasonable person along.

21:26.600 --> 21:29.230
Won't it be wonderful? I can't wait.

21:29.440 --> 21:31.850
I've never looked forward
to anything as much.

21:32.020 --> 21:34.770
I just hope John finds us
somewhere comfortable to stay.

21:35.270 --> 21:38.400
Not too comfortable.
I should like to rough it a little.

21:38.610 --> 21:40.910
I'm sure John will make sure
you get your wish.

21:41.030 --> 21:44.950
Probably get us off in some terrible hole
and watch us suffer.

21:46.040 --> 21:48.540
How's the script?
How's the script coming along?

21:48.700 --> 21:51.040
The script? Fine, Kay.
I think you'll like it.

21:52.790 --> 21:54.250
Kay.

21:58.210 --> 22:00.930
I would like to propose a toast...

22:01.130 --> 22:05.810
on behalf of John and myself,
to our British partners!

22:07.600 --> 22:09.890
Hands across the sea!

22:10.520 --> 22:11.770
Cheers!

22:12.400 --> 22:14.150
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

22:17.320 --> 22:19.689
And I also would like to propose a toast...

22:19.690 --> 22:22.910
to my partner and our producer,
Paul Landers.

22:23.990 --> 22:27.200
Paul, I hope I don't have to kill you
before this picture's finished.

22:31.580 --> 22:33.540
To Kay.

22:34.290 --> 22:37.210
And to Phil and his lovely blushing bride.

22:38.170 --> 22:41.590
And to Pete, probably the best skier
in the Screenwriters Guild...

22:41.670 --> 22:44.090
and the only man
I know who can keep up with me.

22:45.010 --> 22:47.760
The only man I know
who's capable of the dangerous life...

22:47.850 --> 22:51.810
because now he's making a move
on the producer's girlfriend.

22:52.350 --> 22:55.560
And that's right, honey.
He's hung like a stud horse.

23:46.990 --> 23:50.490
Now, doesn't that make you long
for the Dark Continent?

25:22.170 --> 25:23.840
- Thank you, dear.
- Bye-bye.

25:26.340 --> 25:28.340
Feel the mystery of it, kid?

25:38.640 --> 25:41.980
- Hello, John. You have a good trip?
- A little bit long, I'd say.

25:42.190 --> 25:44.770
John, may I introduce
squadron leader Alec Laing.

25:46.150 --> 25:48.860
- And Ralph Lockhart, our unit manager.
- Hello.

25:49.780 --> 25:53.450
This is Pete Verrill.
Tom Harrison, our art director.

25:53.660 --> 25:55.620
- Squadron leader Laing.
- Mr. Laing.

25:55.870 --> 25:59.290
- And yours...?
- Lockhart. Ralph Lockhart.

25:59.370 --> 26:00.750
Of course you are.

26:01.580 --> 26:03.880
Well, gentlemen,
shall we get in out of the sun?

26:04.090 --> 26:07.000
You chaps must be about ready
for a bath and a drink.

26:07.300 --> 26:10.220
I'll take care of the luggage
and see you later at the hotel.

26:10.760 --> 26:13.550
Well, the drink part
certainly sounds good to me.

26:23.690 --> 26:25.360
Get out of the way!

26:26.320 --> 26:27.980
Stupid buggers!

26:35.780 --> 26:37.660
Get out of the way!

26:38.830 --> 26:42.250
They knock off about 10 of them
a month along this road.

26:42.460 --> 26:46.090
It doesn't seem to make the slightest
bloody impression on them, though.

26:46.210 --> 26:48.090
Is that so?

26:54.010 --> 26:56.930
Will you get out of the bloody way?

27:31.670 --> 27:35.220
Hello, I'm Harry Longthorne,
general manager of the Lake Victoria Hotel.

27:35.430 --> 27:38.470
- Harry.
- I'll show you to your rooms.

27:43.980 --> 27:47.400
- Excuse me, Mr. Verrill, do you play soccer?
- Yes, I do. Why?

27:47.650 --> 27:51.070
We're having the annual staff soccer game.
We're minus one white.

27:51.280 --> 27:52.940
- Would you be interested?
- Certainly.

27:53.150 --> 27:56.490
- We'll have a practice the Saturday before.
- All right.

27:57.410 --> 27:59.830
Pete, this is Mrs. Margaret MacGregor.

27:59.910 --> 28:01.910
- Pleasure to meet you.
- And Mr. Marlowe.

28:02.120 --> 28:06.080
He's a licensed white hunter.
Pete's a crack shot, Marine-trained.

28:06.290 --> 28:07.750
Sit down, have a drink, kid.

28:08.790 --> 28:10.170
I'll have an iced tea, please.

28:10.340 --> 28:12.840
Oh, come on, don't embarrass me.
Give him a beer.

28:13.090 --> 28:14.840
I'll have a beer, please.

28:15.050 --> 28:17.550
We are interested in getting
a couple of elephants.

28:18.590 --> 28:21.430
An elephant is dangerous
because he's such a hearty bugger.

28:21.510 --> 28:24.020
To kill him, you have to hit him
in one of two places.

28:24.230 --> 28:26.190
Between the eyes or in the heart.

28:26.310 --> 28:30.690
Not right between the eyes.
Down about six inches.

28:37.030 --> 28:38.700
"There's been silence for hours now."

28:38.950 --> 28:43.120
She's sitting on the back, reading the
Bible. He's still working on the engine.

28:43.290 --> 28:49.130
Finally he says, 'Miss, I'm sorry
I got drunk. I apologize.

28:49.380 --> 28:52.380
What more can a man do
than say he's sorry?'

28:52.590 --> 28:55.800
She says, 'It's not only your drinking
I'm upset about.

28:55.920 --> 28:57.880
You promised to go downriver.'

28:58.720 --> 29:01.640
He says, 'Miss, listen
to me and understand.

29:01.890 --> 29:04.970
There's death a dozen times over
down that river.'

29:05.220 --> 29:09.270
She says, 'You promised.'
He says, 'I'm taking the promise back!'

29:09.810 --> 29:11.150
Silence.

29:12.190 --> 29:16.360
She picks up the Bible, starts reading
again, completely ignoring him.

29:17.490 --> 29:21.570
Now he can't take the silence any longer.
Finally he says, 'All right, miss. You win...

29:21.780 --> 29:24.700
which I'm sure the crocodiles
will be happy to hear.

29:25.330 --> 29:28.040
Down the river we go."'

29:32.210 --> 29:34.420
Well, what do you think, John?

29:34.590 --> 29:38.590
Not bad. But you're trying
to complicate it, Pete.

29:38.670 --> 29:40.760
Things are always good
if they're left simple.

29:40.840 --> 29:42.090
No, not always.

29:42.510 --> 29:46.390
Always. That's what creates truly
important art, is simplicity.

29:46.600 --> 29:48.890
John, there are no rules to art.

29:49.310 --> 29:52.100
There are hundreds of rules.
Hemingway understood that.

29:52.360 --> 29:55.360
That's why he always reduced life
to its simplest terms.

29:55.570 --> 29:59.200
Whether it's courage,
fear, impotence, death.

29:59.860 --> 30:04.530
People's lives just sort of unfold, and things
just happen to them one thing after another.

30:04.740 --> 30:07.540
They were never bogged down
with that nonsense of subplot...

30:07.790 --> 30:10.790
that we sweated over in the past.

30:11.620 --> 30:16.550
Stendhal understood that.
Flaubert. Tolstoy. Melville.

30:16.630 --> 30:18.800
Simplicity is what made them great.

30:19.130 --> 30:22.680
No, Pete. Don't complicate it.
You'll just be wasting your time.

30:23.390 --> 30:24.970
Wasting my time?

30:25.180 --> 30:29.480
I'm wasting my time trying to make the script
better? Isn't that why I'm here, John?

30:29.640 --> 30:31.850
And I think it's damn good.

30:32.480 --> 30:36.230
Well, I just wish the damn script
were finished...

30:36.320 --> 30:38.820
so you and I could go on safari.

30:39.070 --> 30:43.110
Safari? I thought we were gonna finish
the film first and then go on safari.

30:43.530 --> 30:46.240
If we wait till the film is finished,
we'll never get to it.

30:46.450 --> 30:49.370
We'll finish the script,
then go on safari...

30:49.580 --> 30:53.670
then we'll shoot the film
after we've shot our elephants.

30:58.250 --> 31:00.010
Damn lake flies.

31:00.210 --> 31:02.510
Good job they don't bite.

31:31.080 --> 31:32.870
Come on, whites!

31:33.790 --> 31:36.290
There's a spare man in the middle!

31:40.380 --> 31:43.800
- He tripped over my arm! Please.
- That was a fault.

31:48.180 --> 31:52.480
- That was a fault. Let's go!
- How can that be a penalty?

31:53.390 --> 31:56.810
- The local boys are quite good, aren't they?
- Yes.

31:56.940 --> 32:00.900
They went to England last year.
Of course, they didn't stand a chance.

32:01.110 --> 32:02.110
Why is that?

32:02.240 --> 32:06.740
They're clever with their feet, but against a
good British team, they're just too small.

32:06.820 --> 32:09.580
The old blocking and checking
throws them off.

32:09.660 --> 32:12.790
They don't go in for that sort
of thing at all, you see.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.920
Probably be lynched if they did.

32:16.540 --> 32:19.170
We're not like you Americans.

32:19.880 --> 32:22.170
Of course not.

32:35.020 --> 32:40.310
- Oh, well done.
- Hell of a man, that boy. Hell of a man.

32:45.610 --> 32:48.110
Where is the defense?!

33:05.130 --> 33:08.680
What? What? Watch it!

33:19.310 --> 33:20.980
You all right?

33:47.050 --> 33:48.720
Shit!

33:50.380 --> 33:53.100
We found everything you wanted, John,
but it's bloody awful.

33:53.300 --> 33:56.350
It's no place for a man to live.
It's the thickest jungle you've ever seen.

33:56.430 --> 33:57.890
Looks pretty interesting, John.

33:58.020 --> 34:01.440
There's a black-water river and a few huts.
At nighttime there are mosquitoes.

34:01.650 --> 34:06.440
During the day it rains.
There are elephants, crocodiles, Pygmies.

34:06.530 --> 34:11.110
- Lots of big game, is there?
- Antelope, buffalo.

34:11.239 --> 34:15.620
We saw an elephant from the plane
with tusks right down to the ground.

34:19.790 --> 34:22.500
Could you lay a plane on to take us there?

34:22.710 --> 34:25.130
No problem.
When you thinking of going?

34:26.050 --> 34:27.710
Pete?

34:28.969 --> 34:33.340
If I can manage to keep the script simple,
two or three days.

34:40.230 --> 34:41.889
Isn't this just swell...

34:42.100 --> 34:46.150
dining with a beautiful lady
right in the middle of Africa?

34:46.270 --> 34:50.150
- Would you care for some more champagne?
- Yes, I would, rather.

34:50.239 --> 34:53.780
Waiter, could you bring us another bottle
of champagne when you get the chance?

34:53.989 --> 34:56.909
- Yes. Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

34:56.989 --> 35:00.250
You know,
you spoil those boys dreadfully.

35:00.450 --> 35:03.579
Well, as good as they play soccer,
they should be spoiled.

35:03.580 --> 35:06.500
They'll be impossible now
for five or six days.

35:07.130 --> 35:12.130
I don't think so. I think they know
the difference between sport and real life.

35:13.180 --> 35:16.180
- So, Mrs. MacGregor...
- Margaret, please.

35:16.430 --> 35:20.470
Margaret.
Margaret, do you miss London?

35:21.100 --> 35:22.980
Yes, I do, rather.

35:23.190 --> 35:26.110
I don't miss London as much
as I miss the country.

35:26.310 --> 35:30.479
Especially the winter, when you're out there
with the hounds and they have the scent...

35:30.480 --> 35:34.360
- crossing a good bit of country.
- Oh, I do agree.

35:34.450 --> 35:36.450
I'm not keen on London.

35:36.530 --> 35:40.290
I had to live there during the war
and I got awfully fed up with it.

35:40.490 --> 35:44.790
Well, I rather enjoyed it during the war.
The people behaved so magnificently.

35:44.870 --> 35:49.250
They didn't all behave well.
You probably never left the West End.

35:49.340 --> 35:53.220
Not true, not true.
I did a film about the London Blitz.

35:53.420 --> 35:55.090
I was all over town.

35:55.300 --> 35:58.720
Well, you can't have spent much time
in Soho, where I lived.

35:59.680 --> 36:03.850
- Why do you say that, dear?
- I thought the people there were just horrid.

36:04.060 --> 36:06.560
There are an awful lot of Jews
in that neighborhood.

36:06.770 --> 36:09.270
- Mrs. MacGregor.
- Margaret.

36:09.480 --> 36:12.740
Margaret.
I must warn you, I'm a Jew.

36:13.150 --> 36:14.280
- You're not.
- I am.

36:14.490 --> 36:15.820
- No.
- Yes.

36:16.070 --> 36:20.740
- You're pulling my leg!
- No, I'm not pulling your leg, Margaret.

36:20.950 --> 36:22.500
I'm a Jew.

36:23.580 --> 36:25.750
I don't believe you.

36:27.330 --> 36:29.420
I know I shouldn't say this, but...

36:29.590 --> 36:32.920
that was the one thing about which
I thought Hitler was absolutely right.

36:33.050 --> 36:36.180
Now, Margaret, the man has
just got through warning you.

36:36.380 --> 36:39.930
Because the Jews
in London were awful.

36:40.560 --> 36:44.310
They ran the black market.
And they didn't go into the army.

36:44.520 --> 36:48.060
And when they did,
they got themselves cushy jobs.

36:48.480 --> 36:52.230
Of course, there were upper-class Jews,
but I'm not talking about them.

36:52.440 --> 36:54.740
I'm talking about the kikes in Soho.

36:54.940 --> 36:58.490
- The foreigners.
- Margaret. Margaret.

37:00.240 --> 37:04.410
My grandparents were kikes.
My father and my mother were kikes.

37:06.290 --> 37:09.880
- And I'm a kike.
- That's right, dear.

37:10.380 --> 37:12.670
You're not going to tell me
that you're Jewish too?

37:12.880 --> 37:17.880
No. Absolutely not, because that would be a
lie, and I wouldn't want to lie to you ever.

37:18.090 --> 37:20.390
But I would like to tell you
a little story, though.

37:20.890 --> 37:22.680
I love stories.

37:22.890 --> 37:26.850
Well, you mustn't interrupt now, because
you're way too beautiful to interrupt people.

37:27.140 --> 37:31.650
When I was in London
in the early '40s...

37:31.860 --> 37:35.690
I was dining one evening at the Savoy
with a rather select group of people...

37:35.940 --> 37:40.620
and sitting next to me was
a very beautiful lady, much like yourself.

37:41.240 --> 37:45.200
- Now you're pulling my leg.
- Now, just listen, dear.

37:45.410 --> 37:49.580
Well, we were dining and the bombs were falling,
and we were all talking about Hitler...

37:49.790 --> 37:55.000
and comparing him with Napoleon,
and we were all being really brilliant.

37:55.090 --> 37:58.970
And then, suddenly,
this beautiful lady...

37:59.180 --> 38:03.050
she spoke up and said that was the thing
she didn't mind about Hitler...

38:03.140 --> 38:06.060
was the way he was treating
the Jews.

38:07.100 --> 38:09.690
Well, we all started arguing with her,
of course.

38:09.940 --> 38:14.820
Though, mind you, no one at the table
was Jewish. But she persisted.

38:15.230 --> 38:17.190
Are you listening, honey?

38:17.650 --> 38:19.820
Mustn't interrupt Daddy.

38:20.030 --> 38:23.779
That's right.
You're way too beautiful for that.

38:23.780 --> 38:26.910
Anyway, she went on to say that
that's how she felt about it...

38:27.040 --> 38:31.500
that if she had her way, she would kill
them all, burn them in ovens, like Hitler.

38:31.710 --> 38:34.420
Well, we all sat there in silence.

38:34.630 --> 38:38.380
Then finally, I leaned over to her
and I said, "Madam, I have dined..."

38:38.590 --> 38:41.720
with some of the ugliest goddamn bitches
in my time.

38:42.340 --> 38:47.220
And I have dined with some of the
goddamndest ugly bitches in this world.

38:47.350 --> 38:51.100
"But you, my dear,
are the ugliest bitch of them all."

38:53.310 --> 38:57.480
Well, anyway, she got up to leave and she
tripped over a chair and fell on the floor.

38:57.650 --> 39:01.740
And we all just sat there.
No one raised a hand to help her.

39:01.950 --> 39:05.910
And finally when she picked herself up,
I said to her one more time:

39:06.120 --> 39:10.910
"You, my dear, are the ugliest goddamn
bitch I have ever dined with."

39:12.580 --> 39:14.250
Well, you know what happened?

39:14.460 --> 39:17.590
The very next day, she reported me
to the American Embassy.

39:17.800 --> 39:21.670
And they brought me in for reprimand.
And then when they investigated it...

39:21.760 --> 39:25.850
they found out that she was
a German agent. And they locked her up.

39:26.850 --> 39:28.930
Isn't that amazing?

39:29.680 --> 39:31.980
Why did you tell me that story?

39:33.850 --> 39:35.610
I don't know.

39:35.730 --> 39:38.650
It wasn't because I thought you
were a German agent, honey.

39:39.280 --> 39:42.190
But I was tempted tonight
to say the very same thing to you.

39:42.280 --> 39:45.870
I didn't want you to think
I had never said it before.

39:46.030 --> 39:50.620
You, madam, are the...
Well, you know the rest.

39:53.580 --> 39:55.880
- Care for some champagne, honey?
- No, thank you.

39:56.040 --> 39:57.290
Pete?

39:57.630 --> 40:00.960
Well, it's getting late.
I think I'd better go back to my room.

40:01.170 --> 40:03.170
- Pete and I will accompany you.
- There's no need!

40:03.380 --> 40:05.550
No bother at all.

40:06.180 --> 40:08.390
Good night, Margaret.

40:11.390 --> 40:13.390
Sorry, John.

40:13.980 --> 40:15.980
I know you wanted to get laid.

40:16.810 --> 40:18.980
That's all right, kid.

40:19.730 --> 40:22.440
You can't help it if you're a kike.

40:29.240 --> 40:33.500
He says, "Never mind the car keys.
Have you seen the car?"

40:39.340 --> 40:42.260
- You clumsy oaf!
- Dimwit!

40:42.460 --> 40:45.590
- Now look what you've done.
- I'm sorry, boss. I'm sorry.

40:46.090 --> 40:47.680
Come here.

40:48.090 --> 40:50.180
John, where you going?

40:51.010 --> 40:53.100
Pick up that glass, boy.

40:54.140 --> 40:56.350
Damn it, pick it up!

40:58.850 --> 41:01.440
John. What are you up to?

41:01.650 --> 41:04.990
I just want to go talk
to Harry for a moment.

41:08.860 --> 41:10.200
What happened here, Harry?

41:10.410 --> 41:13.870
Well, the little black bastard spilled
a drink all over this gentleman.

41:13.950 --> 41:18.210
- On purpose?
- Who knows? Black bastards.

41:20.920 --> 41:25.970
Harry, I think you're a yellow, rotten,
sadistic son of a bitch.

41:29.590 --> 41:31.679
Now, Mr. Wilson...

41:31.680 --> 41:34.180
I don't have to take that kind
of talk from anyone.

41:35.020 --> 41:36.680
That's right. You don't.

41:36.890 --> 41:40.980
How about going outside
and trying to kick me around?

41:41.270 --> 41:42.820
You're drunk, Mr. Wilson.

41:43.070 --> 41:46.490
I am, but that doesn't change
the fact that you're yellow, Harry.

41:46.690 --> 41:48.030
Bright yellow.

41:48.360 --> 41:52.120
I'm not supposed to fight
with the guests, Mr. Wilson.

41:52.200 --> 41:57.330
I'm not a guest tonight, you yellow
bastard. I happen to be an intruder.

41:58.790 --> 42:00.540
Let's go.

42:08.380 --> 42:10.679
What are you doing?
This doesn't make any sense.

42:10.680 --> 42:14.430
If Mrs. MacGregor had been a man,
wouldn't you have knocked him on his ass?

42:14.510 --> 42:17.230
Yes, I would have.
But this is different.

42:18.180 --> 42:20.060
We fought the preliminary
for the kikes.

42:20.270 --> 42:23.480
Now we're gonna fight
the main event for the niggers.

42:53.550 --> 42:55.220
Go, Harry!

42:59.890 --> 43:01.560
Come on!

43:03.730 --> 43:06.570
- Think the other hand knows how?
- Go, Harry. You got him now.

43:06.770 --> 43:08.320
You got him on the run.

43:26.380 --> 43:27.840
Finish him!

43:34.390 --> 43:36.800
Finish him off, why don't you?

43:37.510 --> 43:39.310
Come on!

43:39.520 --> 43:42.100
Yellow bastard.

43:43.690 --> 43:47.520
Steady on, old man.
Fair's fair, eh?

43:54.950 --> 43:57.580
Please don't get up, Mr. Wilson.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.370
Aren't you gonna stop it?

44:14.010 --> 44:15.590
Come on.

44:17.260 --> 44:19.640
Where is he?
I'll kill the bastard.

44:19.890 --> 44:21.560
He's called it quits, John.

44:21.640 --> 44:24.560
- I told you he was yellow.
- I think you had better get a doctor.

44:24.770 --> 44:27.270
He's hurt that bad?

44:28.730 --> 44:30.690
And he almost killed you.

44:30.940 --> 44:36.950
You're full of crap. I was about ready
to finish him off when you grabbed me.

44:40.620 --> 44:44.250
All right. You're back
in your room now, John.

44:44.370 --> 44:47.290
- I am.
- Yeah, it's all over.

44:47.380 --> 44:49.590
How about that?

44:52.710 --> 44:55.840
I feel pretty good, really.

44:56.880 --> 44:59.390
It's like I always tell you, kid.

44:59.680 --> 45:03.270
You gotta fight when you think
it's the right thing to do.

45:04.810 --> 45:08.150
Otherwise, you feel like
your gut's full of pus.

45:08.770 --> 45:14.610
Even if you get the hell beat out of you.
If you fight, you feel okay about it.

45:19.620 --> 45:23.290
"Dear Pete: Of all the wild animals in
Africa, John Wilson is the wildest.

45:23.450 --> 45:25.450
I beg you to do everything you can"...

45:25.660 --> 45:28.790
Everything you can
to bring him to his senses.

45:28.870 --> 45:33.590
Next time he picks a fight with an employee
of the hotel or the company...

45:33.800 --> 45:36.800
you have my permission
to hit him from behind.

45:37.880 --> 45:41.100
{y:i}Will arrive in Africa in 10 days.
{y:i}Paul.

45:41.300 --> 45:44.220
Good morning! How are we?

45:45.060 --> 45:46.100
Good morning.

45:46.310 --> 45:50.479
- Can I do something for you?
- No. No, you can't, Ralph.

45:50.480 --> 45:52.980
But you can do something
for yourself.

45:53.610 --> 45:55.070
What's that?

45:55.150 --> 45:57.780
Stick to your own job
and stop spying on Wilson.

45:57.990 --> 46:00.990
Spying?
What the hell do you mean?

46:01.120 --> 46:03.410
You told Landers Wilson provoked a fight,
didn't you?

46:03.620 --> 46:08.500
And that's bullshit. Someone should have
hit that bastard a long time ago, Ralph.

46:10.710 --> 46:13.090
You do realize you're backing
the wrong horse, don't you?

46:13.340 --> 46:16.550
Wilson is the boss, and there's not
a damn thing you can do about it.

46:16.760 --> 46:20.720
- Phone, Mr. Lockhart. London calling.
- Yes, all right.

46:20.930 --> 46:23.220
Just remember what I said.

46:25.310 --> 46:27.180
Have a pleasant day.

46:31.980 --> 46:34.690
I would have had him in no time
if you hadn't stopped me.

46:34.770 --> 46:38.440
No, I agree, John.
He only knocked you down 15 times or so.

46:38.530 --> 46:42.200
I was just getting onto his style.
Another 10 minutes, I would've killed him.

46:42.410 --> 46:46.160
- In any case, it was worth doing.
- It certainly was.

46:47.620 --> 46:50.330
I've arranged for you to fly
to a hunting camp on Lake Albert.

46:50.540 --> 46:53.250
You can pick up the Ruki River
there and scout it by boat.

46:53.460 --> 46:55.550
The camp's owned
by a man named Zibelinsky.

46:55.750 --> 46:59.800
- He's laid on a safari, if you have time.
- We'll have time.

47:00.050 --> 47:03.050
Mr. Wilson, Mr. Landers is
on the phone from London.

47:03.140 --> 47:05.890
Well, you tell him
you just missed me.

47:06.600 --> 47:10.770
- John, it might be important.
- You tell him that I've gone on a recce.

47:19.320 --> 47:22.860
Goodbye, you worthless son of a bitch.

47:27.660 --> 47:31.410
Goodbye, you pearl
of Central East Africa.

47:34.250 --> 47:36.920
Goodbye, you lake flies.

47:37.170 --> 47:40.920
Goodbye, you flat-chested,
bucktoothed women.

47:42.880 --> 47:45.180
Goodbye forever.

47:49.770 --> 47:52.270
Hello, anybody home?

47:57.060 --> 48:00.190
Hello. You chaps looking for me?

48:03.200 --> 48:06.240
The name's Hodkins.
Your new airplane driver.

48:06.950 --> 48:09.990
- This is Mr. Wilson, Pete Verrill.
- Call me Hod.

48:10.200 --> 48:14.790
If you don't mind, we better get going.
Don't want to start out late for the Congo.

48:18.210 --> 48:20.840
Hod, I understand you have never
flown in the Congo before.

48:21.050 --> 48:23.340
I should be able to find the way.
But if I can't, well...

48:23.550 --> 48:26.889
we'll just set down in one
of those big trees and spend the night.

48:26.890 --> 48:30.010
Only problem with that is, it's a little
difficult getting it up the next morning.

48:30.140 --> 48:35.020
Well, as a famous pilot once said, "It's
all worth it. Including the final crash."

48:35.230 --> 48:38.560
Well, that's Pete's philosophy too,
isn't it?

48:38.980 --> 48:41.070
I'll get the luggage.

48:48.490 --> 48:50.030
So, this is...

48:50.240 --> 48:52.830
This is really your first time
over the Congo, Hod?

48:53.080 --> 48:55.330
Yeah, quite. Yeah.

48:58.380 --> 49:00.880
Abyssinia!

49:37.160 --> 49:39.880
It's just like the airlines, eh?

50:32.220 --> 50:34.720
- Yes.
- I'll help you.

50:36.680 --> 50:39.020
- It's the spot.
- That's it.

50:45.360 --> 50:47.440
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

50:48.280 --> 50:50.450
You see this hill here?

50:50.570 --> 50:53.070
The hill. Right here! The hill!

50:54.330 --> 50:56.620
Christ! Where's the stick?

50:56.830 --> 50:58.370
Shit!

51:16.720 --> 51:20.180
Jesus.
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

51:20.480 --> 51:22.810
Thanks awfully, old boy.

51:23.230 --> 51:24.650
Pete.

51:26.320 --> 51:28.230
I'm gonna take myself a nap.

51:28.400 --> 51:31.860
Please don't wake me up unless you're
sure we're going to crash, because...

51:32.070 --> 51:34.780
I wouldn't want
to miss something like that.

51:37.290 --> 51:39.250
No.

52:28.040 --> 52:31.630
Hey, all that fancy flying back there
didn't bother you at all, did it?

52:31.710 --> 52:33.880
No, not at all.

52:34.130 --> 52:37.220
It was your friend's idea.
I think he thought it was a good joke.

52:37.470 --> 52:39.140
A joke?

52:39.640 --> 52:41.520
What if the engines
would've stalled out?

52:41.640 --> 52:47.360
Well, I was a bit worried, but the old boy
seemed awfully keen on his rib.

52:47.560 --> 52:49.730
The old boy's a pain in the ass.

52:49.980 --> 52:53.320
A bloody valet with wings.
That's what a pilot is out here.

52:53.490 --> 52:55.070
Ranks right up there
with writers.

52:55.280 --> 52:57.779
- That's what you do, is it?
- Yeah, that's what I do.

52:57.780 --> 52:59.450
I was wondering what your part was.

52:59.660 --> 53:02.250
I've got some very bloody funny stories
I should tell you.

53:02.500 --> 53:08.000
A particularly good one was
when the squadron dog bit me in Khartoum.

53:08.500 --> 53:11.250
- Was his name Horace?
- Horace? No, why?

53:11.420 --> 53:13.090
Forget it.

53:50.040 --> 53:52.710
- You must be Mr. Wilson.
- That's right. Mr. Zibelinsky.

53:52.960 --> 53:56.880
- Delighted.
- This is Pete Verrill and Hodkins, our pilot.

53:57.010 --> 54:00.890
- Quite a place you have here, Mr. Zibelinsky.
- Thank you.

54:00.970 --> 54:05.640
Well, by George, here they are.
The hunters from Hollywood.

54:07.230 --> 54:11.810
- How did you get here?
- Came with a pilot who knew the way.

54:12.150 --> 54:14.730
Right this way, Mr. Wilson.

54:28.830 --> 54:32.170
I think I found a steamboat
for you, Mr. Wilson.

54:32.340 --> 54:35.380
You have?
When can I take a look at it?

54:35.800 --> 54:37.670
Day after tomorrow.

54:37.880 --> 54:40.800
I'm having her put in dry dock
to check her bottom.

54:40.930 --> 54:43.930
The Belgians want a bloody great
bond posted before we can use it...

54:44.010 --> 54:46.100
but we'll talk them
out of that one.

54:46.770 --> 54:48.180
Where's Harrison this evening?

54:48.310 --> 54:51.440
Down on the other location,
near Ponthierville.

54:52.270 --> 54:55.400
Mr. Landers is still trying
to get in touch with you.

54:55.690 --> 54:57.489
I'm sure.

54:57.490 --> 55:01.030
We're going hunting in the morning.
Would you like to go with us, Ralph?

55:01.240 --> 55:05.700
Customs bloke's coming over
from Tatsumu to log all my stuff in.

55:15.000 --> 55:16.670
I say...

55:17.090 --> 55:20.130
is he always like this just
before a production starts?

55:20.630 --> 55:22.220
Like what, Ralph?

55:23.760 --> 55:26.470
He acts as if he couldn't care less.

55:26.680 --> 55:28.350
He'll be fine, Ralph...

55:28.560 --> 55:30.980
once he's killed an elephant.

55:32.520 --> 55:34.730
Good evening, gentlemen.

55:35.150 --> 55:38.650
John, this is my wife, Dorshka.

55:38.780 --> 55:41.490
- What a pleasure indeed, dear.
- Hello.

55:42.320 --> 55:45.320
You know Ralph Lockhart?

55:46.280 --> 55:50.160
- Yes, we met this afternoon.
- And this is Peter Verrill.

55:50.330 --> 55:51.910
- Hello.
- Hello. Welcome.

55:52.330 --> 55:56.290
- So you are a big-game enthusiast also?
- Well, more or less.

55:56.420 --> 56:01.300
Well, it's a pleasure to have you here.
It's a pleasure to have you all here.

56:01.510 --> 56:04.340
I hope you found
your quarters comfortable.

56:04.510 --> 56:07.140
This is simply paradise.

56:07.350 --> 56:09.220
Absolute paradise here.

56:09.850 --> 56:14.230
In fact, I'm seriously thinking
of staying here forever.

56:19.440 --> 56:22.570
Come on. Heave it!

56:26.870 --> 56:31.120
- Well, what do you think of her?
- She's beautiful. Perfect.

56:31.200 --> 56:33.210
Well, not quite.

56:33.410 --> 56:38.000
She's very old, you see? And according
to the skipper, not all that seaworthy.

56:39.050 --> 56:40.500
- Oh, she will be.
- Well, yes.

56:40.710 --> 56:43.630
For everything except
the white-water sequence.

56:44.380 --> 56:46.970
The skipper says
it would be far too dangerous.

56:47.050 --> 56:50.720
She'd fall apart if you attempted
to run the rapids with her.

56:51.140 --> 56:55.310
Actually, I called Mr. Landers
and told him about it.

56:55.390 --> 56:59.480
He suggested...
Well, I should say, he insisted...

56:59.690 --> 57:01.980
that you cut the sequence
out of the film.

57:02.190 --> 57:04.490
- He did?
- Right.

57:04.700 --> 57:06.360
Wrong.

57:07.490 --> 57:10.330
No, she looks sound to me.

57:11.490 --> 57:14.910
Of course, there's only one way
to find out, isn't there, Ralph?

57:56.960 --> 57:58.370
Do stop!

57:59.630 --> 58:01.630
Stop, please! Stop!

58:35.080 --> 58:37.080
Shit.

58:37.910 --> 58:41.880
Are you convinced, Ralph?
Or would you like to continue on?

58:45.630 --> 58:47.420
Oh, no!

58:48.670 --> 58:50.510
I'm convinced.

58:53.260 --> 58:55.510
So am I.

59:12.320 --> 59:15.240
Well, has anyone heard
from our chief hunter yet?

59:15.450 --> 59:18.040
He should be here soon.
I sent one of the boys over to fetch him.

59:18.290 --> 59:20.120
Good.

59:22.960 --> 59:27.210
- Our chief hunter.
- For God's sake, let's have him in.

59:30.550 --> 59:33.800
Explain to him what we want.
We want to go after some game.

59:33.890 --> 59:36.930
Buffalo, preferably an elephant.

01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:16.970
This man is wonderful.
What's his name?

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:18.930
Kivu.

01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:22.390
He's called Kivu because he went
on a trip there once.

01:00:41.370 --> 01:00:45.210
I must say, Kivu is amazing.
He found elephant tracks that big.

01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:51.710
A whole herd. Only darkness prevented us
from going on. Tell him to sit down.

01:00:56.050 --> 01:00:58.050
He says he prefers to stand.

01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:01.720
Oh! Good evening, gentlemen.

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:07.150
So did the Hollywood hunters
have any luck today?

01:01:07.310 --> 01:01:09.110
Tell Kivu to get a good night's rest.

01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:13.690
We'll be leaving at 5:00 in the morning.
We'll get our elephant then.

01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:31.500
I talked to Mr. Landers in London.
He's quite hysterical.

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:34.260
He wants to talk to you tomorrow.

01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:40.180
I told him that we could drive you down
to the border and use that phone there.

01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:45.390
- You did, did you?
- You'll be on safari, I suppose.

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:49.270
You're welcome to come along
with us if you'd like, Ralph.

01:01:49.770 --> 01:01:52.690
No Hollywood safaris for me.

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:04.290
That word has crept into the conversation
quite a few times, hasn't it?

01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:08.960
- Which word is that, sir?
- Hollywood.

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:14.380
I realize it's the name of a place, but
the way you say it has an added meaning.

01:02:14.590 --> 01:02:16.130
Like an insult.

01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:20.430
- Well, I didn't mean it like that.
- Don't contradict me, Ralph.

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.510
I've heard it all before.

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:24.310
In the Army, in New York...

01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:27.940
in the theater.
Hell, I've heard it everywhere.

01:02:28.350 --> 01:02:31.900
People say Hollywood
when they want to insult you.

01:02:32.650 --> 01:02:36.280
Well, really Hollywood is just a place
where they make a profit.

01:02:36.490 --> 01:02:41.820
It's a factory town like Detroit
or Birmingham or Schaffhausen.

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:46.160
Because the cheap element of the town
has been so overly advertised...

01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:50.040
it becomes an insult to remind
a man he's from there.

01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:53.590
They're not talking about the people
who work there...

01:02:53.790 --> 01:02:56.090
and that try to do
something worthwhile.

01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:59.630
They're talking about the whores
when they mention Hollywood.

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:02.350
You know what that word means,
don't you, Ralph?

01:03:04.010 --> 01:03:06.930
- Sure.
- Sure.

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:12.360
Whores have to sell the one thing that
shouldn't be for sale in the world.

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:14.020
And that's love.

01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:18.690
Of course, there are other kinds of whores
than the floozies you frequent, Ralph.

01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:24.240
There are whores who sell words
and ideas and melodies.

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:29.660
I know what I'm talking about because
I've done a little hustling in my time.

01:03:29.790 --> 01:03:33.540
A hell of a lot more
than I'd like to admit to.

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:38.630
And what I sold when I was whoring
I'll never get back.

01:03:40.510 --> 01:03:45.810
What I'm trying to say, it's the whores
who put Hollywood up as a big target.

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:49.140
Sure.

01:04:00.650 --> 01:04:04.070
Hell, John, I didn't realize you
were such a hometown boy.

01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:09.700
- Well, I am, kid. I am when I'm in Africa.
- Yeah.

01:04:10.250 --> 01:04:13.880
No, I'm serious. It took Africa
to bring all this out in me.

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:18.050
Africa and the smell
of my first wild elephant.

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:24.590
It's a shame Kivu couldn't have heard
you say that, John.

01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:29.180
Oh, Kivu knows. Kivu knows
without being told.

01:04:29.310 --> 01:04:32.350
John, why don't you ask Kivu to go
back to Hollywood with you?

01:04:32.850 --> 01:04:37.110
Not a bad idea, kid. He could be
mighty useful around there.

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:38.900
Yeah.

01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:49.330
Where are we going this morning, John?

01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:54.460
A place Kivu knows. And he says a lot
of elephant go there this time of year.

01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:58.500
I was wondering. How do
you two communicate?

01:04:58.630 --> 01:05:03.720
Oh, we get on. I asked him this morning
about going back to the States with me.

01:05:03.930 --> 01:05:07.470
Zib here actually
acted as my interpreter.

01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:10.890
- What did he say?
- Said he didn't know.

01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:16.150
Said he'd have to think about it.
That it was a very big decision.

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:32.290
He says we're getting close.

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:48.140
He says they're in there, but he thinks
it best if only two shooters go.

01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:52.850
- Pete, are you ready?
- No, you and Zib are plenty.

01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:55.430
- You're not coming?
- No, I'll wait here.

01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:59.110
Now, look, kid. I've never
given you much advice.

01:05:59.270 --> 01:06:02.939
I've never forced you to do anything.
But this time it's different.

01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:05.360
I think you should come.
I urge you as a friend.

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:07.860
No, you just go on in there,
John. I'll wait here.

01:06:08.450 --> 01:06:11.620
If you don't come, you'll regret this
as long as you can remember.

01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:14.620
- I don't want to shoot an elephant.
- That's besides the point.

01:06:14.830 --> 01:06:18.370
If you don't come, it's because
you're scared. And you know it.

01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:26.800
All right, well, I guess I'll just have
to live with that.

01:07:27.690 --> 01:07:30.950
John. John, hold your fire.

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:35.030
John, don't shoot!

01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:43.459
It's too dangerous. Hold your fire.
Come back slowly. Come on.

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:46.380
This is him. This is the one
I'm looking for.

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:50.970
It's not safe. There are too many cows
around. Come back slowly. Come on.

01:07:56.310 --> 01:07:58.810
Just come. Do as I tell you. Come on.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:24.330
I've never seen one before,
outside the circus or the zoo.

01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:30.800
They're so majestic. So indestructible.
They're part of the earth.

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:39.850
They make us feel like perverse little
creatures from another planet.

01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:45.520
Without any dignity.

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:50.939
Makes one believe in God.

01:08:52.779 --> 01:08:55.529
In the miracle of creation.

01:08:57.490 --> 01:08:59.790
Fantastic.

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:03.620
They're part of a world
that no longer exists, Hod.

01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:11.880
Feeling of unconquerable time.

01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:19.310
You certainly have a way with words,
Pete. No wonder you're a writer.

01:09:39.410 --> 01:09:43.370
So, what happened, John?
Weren't you able to get close enough?

01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:49.340
We got close enough,
but I wouldn't let him shoot.

01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:52.130
Too many cows around the big fellow.
They'd have charged.

01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:55.470
That was the biggest tusker
in all of Africa.

01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:01.720
It would have been a risk
well worth taking.

01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:12.130
- You all right?
- I'm all right.

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:14.800
John.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.590
Come on, let's face it.
This country's too tough for us.

01:11:18.970 --> 01:11:23.890
We're just characters from Vine Street.
We're not heroes out of one of your films.

01:11:25.970 --> 01:11:27.850
Come on.

01:11:28.270 --> 01:11:29.600
Get up.

01:11:29.850 --> 01:11:35.860
You know, kid, we're gonna end up
together. When we're old, that is.

01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:42.660
Probably live in a cabin up in the Sierras
and pan for gold. Have a couple mules.

01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:48.290
Sit around the campfire at night.
Tell lies to each other.

01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:52.040
- Yeah.
- About all the things we've done.

01:11:52.250 --> 01:11:58.380
The wars we fought. Books you've
written, movies I've made.

01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:01.720
You know, I don't doubt that, John.

01:12:05.470 --> 01:12:09.020
You'll need two, possibly three cameras
on the fire sequence, John.

01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:13.100
If you could just initial these plans,
I can go ahead and start construction.

01:12:13.190 --> 01:12:15.400
It was a risk to all of us.

01:12:15.610 --> 01:12:19.990
A herd of cows can go rogue very quickly
if they have their young with them.

01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:24.660
There have been rogue herds created in
Kenya and Tanganyika in just such a way.

01:12:24.910 --> 01:12:27.790
And then they have to go out and
shoot every bloody one of them.

01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:31.750
All right. All right. Forget it.
We'll try again tomorrow.

01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:37.090
Tomorrow morning. Tomorrow afternoon,
we leave. I have another safari.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.760
You have to get started
on the film, John.

01:12:42.090 --> 01:12:45.010
You can leave if you want. I'm staying.

01:12:45.090 --> 01:12:48.260
The company arrives in Entebbe
the day after tomorrow.

01:12:48.350 --> 01:12:49.600
I'm staying.

01:12:49.810 --> 01:12:53.560
- Jesus Christ! Will you be reasonable?
- I am being reasonable.

01:12:53.690 --> 01:12:58.360
I don't give a goddamn if the company gets
here tomorrow or got here three days ago.

01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:00.650
I'm staying till I get my elephant.

01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:03.150
You need someone with you.
You can't hunt alone.

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:06.910
- Kivu will go with me.
- What about that fellow at the fishery?

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:11.790
The one who used to be game warden
down on the Zambezi. Ogilvy?

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:17.130
Yes. Yes, that's the man. Yes, they say
he killed over 500 elephants in his day.

01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:21.300
- Well, let's get him up here.
- John, how long do you plan on staying?

01:13:22.130 --> 01:13:25.970
Well, that depends upon the elephants.
And on the guides.

01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:32.350
If Ogilvy turns out to be another old lady
like the rest of you, it may take months.

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:36.940
But if he's half the man Kivu is,
it may take no time at all.

01:13:48.910 --> 01:13:52.500
What's the matter, kid?
Go ahead and spit it out.

01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:56.960
You're sitting around stewing like
a dame who's just been kicked out of bed.

01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:01.340
You're either crazy...

01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:08.430
or the most egocentric, irresponsible
son of a bitch that I've ever met.

01:14:09.890 --> 01:14:13.850
You're about to blow this whole picture
out of your nose, John.

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:17.400
And for what?

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.520
To commit a crime.

01:14:21.570 --> 01:14:24.570
To kill one of the rarest,
most noble creatures...

01:14:24.690 --> 01:14:28.160
that roams the face
of this crummy earth.

01:14:29.490 --> 01:14:35.200
And in order for you to commit this crime,
you're willing to forget about all of us...

01:14:35.330 --> 01:14:38.460
and let this whole goddamn
thing go down the drain.

01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:45.420
You're wrong, kid.

01:14:46.050 --> 01:14:51.390
It's not a crime to kill an elephant.
It's bigger than all that.

01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:55.140
It's a sin to kill an elephant.

01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:59.230
Do you understand? It's a sin.

01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:03.610
It's the only sin that you can buy
a license and go out and commit.

01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:07.449
That's why I want to do it before
I do anything else in this world.

01:15:07.450 --> 01:15:12.240
Do you understand me?
Of course you don't.

01:15:12.450 --> 01:15:15.370
How could you?
I don't understand myself.

01:15:20.290 --> 01:15:24.550
Well, if you don't need me, then I'll
take the plane to London tomorrow.

01:15:25.170 --> 01:15:31.430
You do that. I've never been one to interfere
with anything a friend of mine wants to do.

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:17.310
- How do you do? It's nice to meet you.
- Welcome. My wife.

01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:19.480
- Hello. How do you do?
- Good morning, welcome.

01:16:19.730 --> 01:16:22.230
- Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.
- How do you do?

01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:24.480
- Well, hello.
- Welcome. Welcome.

01:16:24.730 --> 01:16:27.320
Miss Gibson. Right here.

01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:34.320
Pete!

01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:38.370
Pete! Where's John? Why isn't he here?

01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:41.160
I'm going back to London
on the next flight, Paul.

01:16:41.410 --> 01:16:43.920
What happened? Where's John?
Where's the script?

01:16:44.290 --> 01:16:47.550
- I sent you the script. Didn't you get it?
- I got half of it.

01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:50.670
- There's only one copy?
- No. John has the original.

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:53.510
If he hasn't lost it,
which he probably has.

01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:54.840
- How are you, Pete?
- Hi.

01:16:55.050 --> 01:16:59.350
- Where's the ogre?
- He's out scouting locations.

01:16:59.850 --> 01:17:02.140
I hope you boys have
improved the script.

01:17:02.350 --> 01:17:05.060
What Kay means is,
is her part gonna get bigger?

01:17:05.150 --> 01:17:08.520
Not at all. I don't mind if you do
the talking and I don't say a word.

01:17:08.730 --> 01:17:11.740
As long as I get to play
a real human being.

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:15.200
Beautiful, Kay. Come with me.
Come this way. To the side.

01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:18.120
Mr. Duncan! Can we have one of you
with your new bride?

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:21.250
How do you want it, boys?
Passionate or domestic?

01:17:21.950 --> 01:17:24.040
Can we have a kiss?

01:17:25.290 --> 01:17:26.960
Thank you very much.

01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:49.980
Peter, think. Think what will happen to
the morale of the company if you go back.

01:17:50.230 --> 01:17:54.820
They'll think something terrible is wrong.
I can't start a picture that way.

01:17:54.990 --> 01:18:01.370
Paul, don't you understand? Something
terrible is wrong! The man has the fever.

01:18:01.450 --> 01:18:06.580
It's just like any passion.
It's irresponsible and it's destructive!

01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:12.340
I understand how you feel, but we've got
a picture to make. You've got to stay.

01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:17.760
You've got to help me get him back. If he's
not back in three days, we'll all be ruined.

01:18:19.850 --> 01:18:22.430
Apologize to him.

01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:28.060
Go on, apologize to him.

01:18:33.070 --> 01:18:37.240
No. I won't apologize to him, Paul,
but I'll tell you what I will do.

01:18:37.450 --> 01:18:41.620
I'll get that script from him. Because
you hired me to write a script.

01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:43.700
And it's the best writing I've ever done.

01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:48.210
And I'll be goddamned
if I'll let that bastard destroy it!

01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:20.110
- Hello, chaps.
- Where's John?

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:23.330
- Well, believe it or not, he's gone.
- Gone where?

01:19:23.530 --> 01:19:28.660
He's visiting Kivu's village up
in Semuliki. It's the truth.

01:19:28.750 --> 01:19:32.500
Ogilvy and Kivu convinced him
that's the best place to find a big tusker.

01:19:32.630 --> 01:19:34.800
- So off they went.
- Shit.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.920
- And how far is that from here?
- About six miles.

01:19:38.130 --> 01:19:40.640
Most of it through swamp.

01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:43.850
- There's been a change in plans.
- What's that?

01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:47.600
The boss has decided to start
shooting the film there.

01:19:47.810 --> 01:19:52.940
Made up his mind yesterday when we
finally cleared the trucks through customs.

01:19:53.770 --> 01:19:57.740
He seems to think Kivu's village
is much more authentic.

01:19:57.940 --> 01:20:01.360
The company can stay
at the hunting camp.

01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:09.960
Have a pleasant day.

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:19.090
There it is, there.
That must be the village there.

01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:41.240
I don't believe it.

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:44.450
I just don't believe it.

01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:54.459
What about the village we built
at Masindi? It cost a fortune.

01:20:54.460 --> 01:20:57.090
Lockhart says John plans to use
that for the big fire.

01:20:57.170 --> 01:20:59.880
He'll move back there once
he's finished in the Congo.

01:21:00.090 --> 01:21:04.050
I'm not going to let him do it! I'm not
going to send people to a place like that.

01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:06.550
I'll call off the picture first!

01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:08.850
You've already invested
over 100,000 pounds, Paul.

01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:12.600
I'll pay it back if it takes
the rest of my life.

01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:16.980
Why don't you just tell everybody
that it'll be rough.

01:21:17.110 --> 01:21:20.610
- But it'll make for a distinguished film.
- No, we can't do that.

01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:22.610
- Why not?
- Because we can't!

01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:26.370
Either we call it off
or we play along with Wilson.

01:21:26.450 --> 01:21:30.450
We can be honorable or crooked.
There's no middle road.

01:21:31.370 --> 01:21:33.660
Well, I don't agree with you.

01:21:33.790 --> 01:21:36.880
I've always found that it's better
just to tell the truth.

01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:45.050
If I had always told the truth, Pete,
I would now be a cake of soap.

01:22:07.450 --> 01:22:12.450
- Does this look familiar to you, Pete?
- Yes, Paul, we're getting close.

01:22:12.660 --> 01:22:15.670
It's awfully primitive.
Where's the hotel?

01:22:45.190 --> 01:22:50.530
- Well, here it is. Home away from home.
- Well, I think this is quite lovely.

01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:53.740
Holy shit.

01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:19.190
Oh, do come in, chaps. Do come in.

01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:21.480
I've been looking forward
to seeing you again.

01:23:21.690 --> 01:23:26.280
May I present Madam Dorshka
and Mr. Zibelinsky, our hosts.

01:23:29.610 --> 01:23:33.580
Well, this is glorious.

01:23:40.250 --> 01:23:41.920
This is marvelous.

01:23:47.130 --> 01:23:50.050
And this is Count Ogilvy,
my new white hunter.

01:23:50.260 --> 01:23:51.930
Hello, John.

01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:56.600
- So wonderful to be here.
- Excuse my friend.

01:23:56.850 --> 01:23:59.640
- How do you do? Very glad to see you.
- Hello, John.

01:23:59.850 --> 01:24:02.149
- Hello, John.
- Pleasure to see you all.

01:24:02.150 --> 01:24:03.940
- How you doing?
- Cheers.

01:24:06.610 --> 01:24:10.360
Well, have some champagne,
everyone, and let's get with it.

01:24:10.490 --> 01:24:11.950
- Cheers, John.
- With the evening.

01:24:13.820 --> 01:24:16.740
I trust you all enjoyed
our borscht à la Russe?

01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:21.210
- Excellent. Absolutely first class.
- Spiffing.

01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:24.960
And now we have
the piêce de résistance.

01:24:39.770 --> 01:24:43.440
It's a freshly killed reedbuck
from Semuliki plain.

01:24:43.650 --> 01:24:48.860
The female of the species, just to prove
that God does not let man off the hook.

01:24:51.490 --> 01:24:58.040
So I told Anatole that he should not let
Paulette ever do that again.

01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:03.040
John, can we stop playing games?

01:25:05.250 --> 01:25:08.880
Playing games, dear fellow?
I don't quite understand.

01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:13.050
Well, we have to get started tomorrow.

01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:18.060
Red has to go out to the location.
You have to check the costumes.

01:25:18.260 --> 01:25:20.560
I'm willing to do anything
you suggest, dear boy.

01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:22.850
That is, within reason, of course.

01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:30.440
Well, first of all can you drop that phony
English accent? And for God's sakes...

01:25:30.570 --> 01:25:34.950
abandon your role
of the great white hunter...

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:38.620
and become a movie director again.

01:25:44.330 --> 01:25:47.540
Listen, you Balkan rug peddler...

01:25:47.790 --> 01:25:51.210
my role of the great hunter,
as you put it, is my own business.

01:25:51.420 --> 01:25:55.720
It has nothing to do with you.
It's a sacred subject.

01:25:55.890 --> 01:25:59.220
Much like the sex life of my mother.

01:25:59.970 --> 01:26:04.890
It's something you'll refrain from talking
about or even thinking about.

01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:09.900
It's way too difficult a subject
for your small little brain to grasp.

01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:13.110
It's a passion that's beyond you.

01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:18.530
I'd have to explain to you the sound
of the wind and the smell of the woods.

01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:21.240
I'd have to create you
all over again...

01:26:21.450 --> 01:26:27.290
and stamp out all those years you spent
on the dirty pavement in cramped shoes.

01:26:30.290 --> 01:26:33.340
I'm not interested in your hunting.

01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:39.390
It doesn't mean a thing to me except
when it interferes with the picture.

01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:42.810
How is it interfering
with the picture? When?

01:26:43.020 --> 01:26:47.100
I haven't even gotten the last section
of the script yet!

01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:52.860
Oh, dear. Well, I'll correct
that immediately.

01:26:52.940 --> 01:26:54.190
Kivu!

01:26:59.950 --> 01:27:01.700
You've finished your rewrites, have you?

01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:05.660
He polished it, Pete,
and gave it a little balls.

01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:11.290
It has to be typed.
Copies have to be made.

01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:17.050
The ape!

01:27:17.550 --> 01:27:20.680
Somebody get hold
of the goddamned ape!

01:27:53.340 --> 01:27:57.510
Frontal brain shot!
And for God's sake, don't miss!

01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:08.310
Oh, God. This makes
it all so worthwhile.

01:29:33.230 --> 01:29:37.480
- Oh, isn't this wonderful?
- My God, what a performance.

01:29:37.690 --> 01:29:42.070
- They really love him, don't they?
- They sure do.

01:29:47.830 --> 01:29:50.490
Or, if you've got time
this afternoon, we could...

01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:52.370
John, scene 244.

01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:57.210
Pete, I'm surprised to see you here,
last night. I thought you'd be in Paris...

01:29:57.290 --> 01:30:01.550
devoting yourself to literature and all
those things you know nothing about.

01:30:01.670 --> 01:30:05.720
Yeah? Well, I thought you'd have
your big tusker by now.

01:30:08.220 --> 01:30:11.890
Stick around, kid. Stick around.

01:30:23.780 --> 01:30:25.450
When do we start?

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:35.670
Shit.

01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:51.430
No shooting today, folks.

01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:54.100
Where you going, John? John!

01:30:54.230 --> 01:30:57.020
I'm going hunting. We can't shoot
the sequence in the rain.

01:30:57.140 --> 01:31:01.400
- Well, how long will the rain last?
- Oh, it could last for days.

01:31:01.610 --> 01:31:04.360
It's the beginning of the rainy season.

01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:07.570
Why didn't somebody tell us
about a rainy season?

01:31:07.700 --> 01:31:10.700
I did! I told Mr. Wilson.

01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:15.910
He just said, well, the days he couldn't
shoot the film, he could shoot elephant.

01:31:19.790 --> 01:31:23.630
At this rate, I'll be in debt
the rest of my life.

01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:41.150
- Come here, you little devil!
- Now, I feel this...

01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:46.150
this change is appropriate, but John
seems to think it's a bit complicated.

01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:47.820
Why complicated?

01:31:48.030 --> 01:31:54.080
That's a good question, Kay. And if I
could sit John down someday, I'd ask.

01:31:57.410 --> 01:32:00.540
No luck? No elephants?

01:32:01.170 --> 01:32:07.090
Well, we saw plenty of them. We just
didn't see the big tusker. The one I want.

01:32:07.340 --> 01:32:12.010
We'll get one. These rains won't
stop for another week yet.

01:32:12.510 --> 01:32:14.310
You think so?

01:32:20.770 --> 01:32:22.100
Shit.

01:33:28.340 --> 01:33:33.340
It's going to be a clear day.
We can finally start the picture.

01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:42.440
I'm sending the company
to Kivu's village.

01:33:48.570 --> 01:33:52.950
John, we've been sitting
here for five days.

01:33:56.280 --> 01:34:00.240
We're already a week behind.
We haven't even got one shot.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:10.460
All right.

01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:25.480
- All right! Let's make a movie!
- I'll believe that when I see it.

01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:43.000
Boss! Boss! Boss!

01:34:47.670 --> 01:34:50.920
He never looks at the script, does he?

01:34:51.340 --> 01:34:56.010
Nope. He's afraid he'll lose
his artistic spontaneity.

01:34:57.260 --> 01:35:01.260
What are you two grousing about?
What's wrong, Paul?

01:35:01.350 --> 01:35:04.770
I'm on the spot. I'm ready to make
magic. Make you rich.

01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:07.940
- What the hell's the matter with you?
- Nothing.

01:35:08.020 --> 01:35:13.650
Wait. John. Kivu sent him.
He's onto a big herd.

01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:16.359
- Is that right?
- About three miles from here.

01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:18.360
What are we waiting on?

01:35:20.450 --> 01:35:22.200
John, the sky is clear.

01:35:22.410 --> 01:35:26.160
You've got plenty of unloading to do.
Plenty of work. I'll be right back.

01:35:26.460 --> 01:35:32.420
- Well, how do I know you'll come back?
- Send your boy Pete if you don't trust me.

01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:36.470
Go with him. Make sure he doesn't forget
we're starting a picture.

01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:41.050
- He doesn't need me.
- That's right. And it may be risky.

01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:33.310
You're onto a big one?

01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:35.940
What's he saying?

01:36:39.570 --> 01:36:41.450
We'll leave the boy here.

01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:47.700
John.

01:36:49.580 --> 01:36:51.870
Please, let's go back.
They're waiting for us.

01:36:52.210 --> 01:36:54.290
Well, let them wait.

01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:19.070
Bad country, this. Walk right up to
a big tusker before you'd ever see him.

01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:53.390
- What's he saying?
- He says they're just beyond these trees.

01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:40.530
It's a big one, all right. But there
are cows and young ones with him.

01:38:40.730 --> 01:38:44.570
- What do we do?
- It's no good. I don't like it.

01:38:45.110 --> 01:38:48.160
- What does Kivu say?
- I don't care what he says.

01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:51.580
I've killed more than 500 of them.
And I'll tell you, this is not the day.

01:38:51.910 --> 01:38:55.120
How many chances does a man get?

01:38:56.170 --> 01:38:58.250
That's never a reason
to do something wrong.

01:38:58.460 --> 01:39:01.380
Would you ask Kivu what he thinks?

01:39:08.050 --> 01:39:11.810
- He says he's willing to try.
- Of course he's willing. He's got guts.

01:39:12.010 --> 01:39:14.930
Jesus Christ, John! Give it up.

01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:20.150
- It's his word against mine, Mr. Wilson.
- I'm asking, will you come along?

01:39:22.020 --> 01:39:23.690
Come on, Kivu.

01:41:14.550 --> 01:41:16.310
No!

01:44:38.930 --> 01:44:44.220
What are they saying, Ogilvy?
What are the drums saying?

01:44:44.430 --> 01:44:49.350
They're telling everybody what happened,
that's all. The bad news.

01:44:53.610 --> 01:44:57.360
- It always starts with the same words.
- What are they?

01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:04.240
White hunter. Black heart.

01:45:10.370 --> 01:45:14.460
White hunter. Black heart.

01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:36.150
You were right, Pete.
The ending is all wrong.

01:46:11.810 --> 01:46:14.520
John, we're ready.

01:46:35.580 --> 01:46:39.960
All right, quiet please, everyone.
Ready, Miss Gibson?

01:46:52.980 --> 01:46:54.560
Ready, Mr. Wilson?

01:46:56.650 --> 01:46:58.230
Roll them!

01:46:58.730 --> 01:47:00.400
Speed.

01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:08.950
- Mark it.
- Scene one, take one.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:23.550
Action.
