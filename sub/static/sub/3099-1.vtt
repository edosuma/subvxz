<i>Beautiful dreamer</i>

01:12.239 --> 01:13.740
<i>Wake unto me</i>

01:14.908 --> 01:19.371
<i>Starlight and dew drops
Are waiting for thee</i>

01:20.581 --> 01:25.127
<i>Sounds of the rude world
Heard in the day</i>

01:26.962 --> 01:31.508
<i>Lulled by the moonlight
Have all passed away</i>

01:32.843 --> 01:35.220
<i>Beautiful dreamer</i>

01:36.555 --> 01:37.723
<i>Queen of my song</i>

01:40.017 --> 01:41.643
<i>List while I woo thee</i>

01:41.727 --> 01:43.687
<i>With soft melody</i>

01:45.731 --> 01:47.566
<i>- Gone are the cares of...</i>

01:51.153 --> 01:53.655
Alfalfa? Are you okay?

01:54.072 --> 01:55.824
- Yeah, thanks, Darla.

01:55.908 --> 01:59.161
Well, thank you for
that lovely performance for Share Day.

01:59.244 --> 02:00.412
But I'm not finished yet.

02:00.495 --> 02:01.997
Yeah, you are.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.208
Allow me to show you how it's really done.

02:05.501 --> 02:07.878
All right, Waldo,
but this will be the last song today.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.714
Afterwards, we need to get back to work.

02:15.719 --> 02:17.679
Oh.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.728
<i>Well, she's all you'd ever want</i>

02:24.811 --> 02:26.772
<i>She's the kind they'd like to flaunt</i>

02:26.855 --> 02:28.440
<i>And take to dinner</i>

02:30.776 --> 02:32.819
<i>But she always knows her place</i>

02:32.903 --> 02:34.655
<i>She's got style, she's got grace</i>

02:34.738 --> 02:36.281
<i>She's a winner</i>

02:38.700 --> 02:40.619
<i>She's a lady</i>

02:41.161 --> 02:42.454
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa</i>

02:42.621 --> 02:44.706
<i>She's a lady</i>

02:45.415 --> 02:48.460
<i>Talkin' about that little lady</i>

02:49.795 --> 02:53.173
<i>And the lady is mine</i>

02:55.008 --> 02:58.720
<i>Well, she's never in the way
Always something nice to say</i>

02:58.804 --> 03:00.764
<i>What a blessing</i>

03:02.808 --> 03:06.770
<i>Well, to leave her on her own
Knowing she's okay alone</i>

03:06.854 --> 03:09.147
<i>And there's no messing</i>

03:10.399 --> 03:11.900
Psst, psst.

03:48.228 --> 03:51.565
- Huh? What? Hurry, it's the signal.
- Come on.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.942
<i>She's a lady</i>

03:54.026 --> 03:55.652
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa</i>

03:55.736 --> 03:57.529
<i>She's a lady</i>

03:58.238 --> 04:01.325
<i>Talkin' about that little lady</i>

04:02.201 --> 04:03.285
<i>- And the...</i>

04:03.368 --> 04:05.454
- Thank you so much, Waldo.
- But...

04:05.537 --> 04:07.247
- Please, take a seat, that was...
- Wait, but I'm...

04:07.331 --> 04:08.916
Nope, take a seat. Thank you very much.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.792
- That was, uh...

04:11.210 --> 04:12.961
Unique. That was very unique.

04:14.004 --> 04:16.507
Hold your horses, I'm coming.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.341
Oh. Hello.

04:19.510 --> 04:21.720
And what can I do for you two?

04:21.803 --> 04:25.599
Stymie has to come home.
Our daddy broke two of his legs.

04:25.682 --> 04:28.060
Two of his legs? Oh, my.

04:28.143 --> 04:31.522
Mary Ann has to come, too.
Her mama's havin' a baby.

04:31.897 --> 04:33.732
A baby? Since when?

04:33.815 --> 04:34.900
Since this morning.

04:34.983 --> 04:37.069
She found out about it
and now she's having it.

04:37.653 --> 04:42.449
And my mama says Spanky and Alfalfa have
to come home right away.

04:42.741 --> 04:44.451
Right away? Why?

04:44.701 --> 04:46.620
It's important business.

04:46.912 --> 04:49.373
Oh. What's the important business?

04:49.456 --> 04:52.167
Beats me. That's what
Spanky told me to say.

04:52.251 --> 04:53.335
Right, Spank?

04:58.215 --> 05:02.052
Spanky, Alfalfa, Stymie,
Mary Ann, get up here right away.

05:03.470 --> 05:04.847
They're in trouble.

05:06.932 --> 05:08.517
Something important has come up

05:08.600 --> 05:11.270
and you all need to go home right away.

05:12.646 --> 05:15.566
Well, Miss Crabtree, it's
been a real great year.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.067
Yeah, have a good summer, Miss Crabtree.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.485
See ya next year.

05:18.569 --> 05:19.987
Don't take any wooden nickels.

05:20.571 --> 05:21.613
Ah.

05:22.364 --> 05:23.448
Beep, beep.

05:23.532 --> 05:25.701
Miss Crabtree, I've got
your ice cream cake.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.327
- Oh, yes, bring it right in.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.960
All right, boys and girls,
I have a little surprise.

05:35.043 --> 05:37.004
We're not gonna do any more work today.

05:37.087 --> 05:39.590
Instead, we're gonna have
an end-of-the-year party

05:39.673 --> 05:42.176
with a great big ice cream cake.

05:44.052 --> 05:47.306
You know, Miss Crabtree,
I think our folks can wait a little while.

05:47.806 --> 05:51.977
Yeah! My mom's had babies before.
I'm sure she knows what to do.

05:52.769 --> 05:55.522
My daddy isn't goin' anywhere. He can't.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.191
His legs are broke.

05:57.733 --> 05:59.067
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

05:59.151 --> 06:02.029
You can't keep
your families waiting just for a party.

06:02.112 --> 06:04.489
Now run along now
and I will see you next fall.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.035
- No, please.
- Run along. See you next fall.

06:08.118 --> 06:10.120
- She had them before.
- Oh.

06:10.204 --> 06:12.039
You kids don't know what you're missing.

06:12.122 --> 06:13.332
Who wants cake?

06:13.415 --> 06:15.250
Me!

06:17.753 --> 06:20.714
Oh, man. Did you see that cake?

06:20.797 --> 06:23.592
Not just a cake, an ice cream cake.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.178
Yeah, ice cream and cake.

06:26.428 --> 06:29.848
The two best
things in the world all mixed together.

06:29.932 --> 06:32.017
Too many calories, men.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.895
And you all
could stand to lose a few pounds anyway.

06:35.646 --> 06:36.688
Mmm.

06:36.772 --> 06:38.440
Man, that cake was good.

06:38.524 --> 06:40.108
You said it, pal.

06:40.317 --> 06:42.569
No time to dwell on the past, men.

06:42.653 --> 06:45.447
Summer vacation has officially begun.

06:45.948 --> 06:50.202
No school, no homework,
no getting up early.

06:50.285 --> 06:53.789
- We're free. Come on, time's a-wastin'.
- All right!

06:53.872 --> 06:55.165
- Whoo-hoo!

06:57.251 --> 06:58.502
Hi!

06:58.961 --> 07:01.088
- Hiya, Pops!
- Hi there. Hi.

07:07.803 --> 07:08.971
Yay!

07:11.640 --> 07:12.683
Oh!

07:14.643 --> 07:17.354
- Kids! Watch where you're going.
- Sorry.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.690
- Sorry, Officer Kennedy.
- Wait a minute.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.733
Aren't you kids supposed to be in school?

07:21.817 --> 07:24.403
We got time off for good behavior.

07:24.486 --> 07:25.904
That would be a first.

07:25.988 --> 07:29.074
So who are the flowers for? Miss Crabtree?

07:29.157 --> 07:30.909
Yeah!

07:30.993 --> 07:32.035
They were.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.620
When are you finally gonna work up

07:33.704 --> 07:35.706
the nerve to ask her to marry you?

07:35.789 --> 07:39.251
I will, I will.
When school's out and the time's right,

07:39.334 --> 07:40.711
I'll be ready.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.046
I got the ring. Finally paid it off.

07:44.047 --> 07:45.128
- Ooh!
- Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

07:45.257 --> 07:47.968
Look, don't touch. You understand?

07:48.051 --> 07:51.138
Isn't there supposed to be a diamond on it?

07:53.307 --> 07:57.060
Oh, there it is.
It looks real nice when you can see it.

07:57.144 --> 08:00.147
- Well, good luck, Officer Kennedy.
- Thank you.

08:00.230 --> 08:02.816
Try not to blow it. Come on, guys.

08:11.617 --> 08:13.368
To the bakery!

08:19.750 --> 08:21.210
Hiya, Grandma.

08:21.293 --> 08:23.212
Oh, hi, kids. Oh, hi!

08:23.712 --> 08:25.130
Hi, Grandma.

08:25.464 --> 08:28.050
Oh, boy. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:29.343 --> 08:34.765
Oh, so, isn't there still
one more day left at school?

08:35.349 --> 08:39.436
They never do
anything important on the last day.

08:39.937 --> 08:42.063
Except eat ice cream cake.

08:42.147 --> 08:45.817
Okay. I don't suppose
I could interest you in cinnamon muffins.

08:46.068 --> 08:47.736
Yeah!

08:47.819 --> 08:49.571
- Here we go.
- Me, Grandma!

08:56.828 --> 08:58.330
I caught it!

08:58.622 --> 09:01.416
Thanks, Grandma. You are the best.

09:01.500 --> 09:04.294
Yeah! Thanks, Grandma!

09:04.419 --> 09:06.672
I didn't forget you.

09:07.965 --> 09:11.009
Come on, gang. To the tree house!

09:12.845 --> 09:14.096
See you later, Grandma.

09:15.556 --> 09:17.391
- After you, Petey.

09:18.809 --> 09:20.727
Home, sweet home.

09:20.811 --> 09:21.854
Mmm-hmm.

09:21.937 --> 09:23.730
Petey, do your stuff.

10:02.186 --> 10:04.688
Whoa! No! No, no, no!

10:08.692 --> 10:09.860
Kids.

10:12.571 --> 10:14.489
Are they gone, Miss Crabtree?

10:14.990 --> 10:16.825
Oh, they are indeed, Officer Kennedy.

10:17.367 --> 10:18.827
And now that they are,

10:18.911 --> 10:21.079
I think that we
can call each other by our first names,

10:21.163 --> 10:22.414
Ed.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.458
- Of course, June.

10:25.626 --> 10:26.919
What are those?

10:27.336 --> 10:28.504
Oh. Uh...

10:28.587 --> 10:31.298
They were flowers,
till your kids got a hold of them.

10:31.381 --> 10:32.591
Thank you.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.718
It's the thought that counts.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.386
Mmm.

10:36.470 --> 10:39.056
I was thinking,
maybe you and I could have lunch

10:39.139 --> 10:42.392
at this very special place
that I happen to know of?

10:42.476 --> 10:45.437
A date with my man. Why, I'd love to.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.022
Oh.

10:48.065 --> 10:50.859
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

10:52.194 --> 10:54.530
Me, me, me, me, me.

10:54.738 --> 10:55.781
Me.

10:59.368 --> 11:00.410
Ready, gang?

11:00.536 --> 11:01.995
- Yeah!
- Ready!

11:02.079 --> 11:03.205
Ready, indeed.

11:03.247 --> 11:05.332
Hi, ladies and gentlemen.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.918
Tonight, we're going to perform an oldie,
but a goodie

11:08.043 --> 11:09.837
called <i>I Got You, Babe.</i>

11:10.254 --> 11:12.589
My name is Spanky and we are

11:12.673 --> 11:16.093
the International Silver String
Submarine Band.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.177
Huh?

11:17.261 --> 11:18.345
The what?

11:18.428 --> 11:21.765
That's our band name? Since when?

11:21.890 --> 11:23.851
Since I just thought it up a second ago.

11:24.101 --> 11:26.770
Makes us sound important.

11:27.271 --> 11:28.355
- Okay.
- I agree.

11:28.438 --> 11:30.440
Okay, I like it.

11:30.524 --> 11:33.360
And a one and a two and a three.

11:43.245 --> 11:45.289
Hello, Mrs. Larson.

11:45.956 --> 11:47.040
Hi.

11:47.416 --> 11:50.127
You're early today. Here you go.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.795
On the house, as usual.

11:51.879 --> 11:54.298
- What is that noise?
- That's the kids' band.

11:54.548 --> 11:55.632
Oh...

11:55.716 --> 11:59.136
Well, tell them to keep practicing.

12:00.637 --> 12:02.890
Oh, and you got
a certified letter here from the bank.

12:03.140 --> 12:04.224
Oh.

12:04.308 --> 12:05.434
Sign here.

12:09.938 --> 12:11.982
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

12:12.316 --> 12:13.317
Thank you!

12:13.442 --> 12:14.484
You're welcome.

12:14.610 --> 12:16.069
They'll get better.

12:16.153 --> 12:17.779
I hope so.

12:25.996 --> 12:27.831
Oh. Oh.

12:30.834 --> 12:33.337
Hold it. Hold it. Why'd you stop?

12:33.462 --> 12:36.173
We were just
getting to the best part, where I sing.

12:36.298 --> 12:39.259
We're supposed to be playing,<i>
I Got You, Babe.</i>

12:39.343 --> 12:42.179
It sounds more like, <i>I
Got a Headache, Babe.</i>

12:42.304 --> 12:43.972
What's wrong with everybody?

12:44.014 --> 12:45.974
We're doing the best we can, Spank.

12:46.016 --> 12:48.352
You know, he's right.

12:48.435 --> 12:52.105
Our music lacks a certain <i>je ne sais quoi.</i>

12:52.940 --> 12:54.274
Like what?

12:54.358 --> 12:57.694
Like a girl singer.
That would complete our sound.

12:57.819 --> 13:00.489
And I know the perfect girl.

13:01.198 --> 13:02.866
Let me guess, Darla.

13:02.950 --> 13:03.992
Not again.

13:04.034 --> 13:05.661
- Great minds think alike.

13:05.702 --> 13:09.164
You've heard her sing in class before.
She's really good.

13:09.206 --> 13:11.333
No girls allowed in the gang.

13:11.375 --> 13:14.336
But Mary Ann's in the gang.
And she's a girl.

13:14.378 --> 13:16.547
I meant a real girl.

13:18.215 --> 13:20.384
I am a real girl.

13:20.509 --> 13:22.886
Okay. Okay. You're a real girl.

13:24.888 --> 13:27.474
Kids? Kids.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.726
What is it, Grandma?

13:29.852 --> 13:31.395
Would you all watch the bakery for me?

13:31.478 --> 13:34.523
Something urgent came up
and I've gotta go to the bank.

13:34.565 --> 13:36.859
- What's wrong, Grandma?
- Everything's fine.

13:36.900 --> 13:39.736
You just watch the shop
and I'll be back soon.

13:39.862 --> 13:44.074
Don't worry, Grandma.
I got everything under control.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.325
No problem.

13:48.078 --> 13:49.246
Hello?

13:49.746 --> 13:50.998
Anybody here?

13:51.915 --> 13:53.709
- Hi!
- Yes, ma'am. How may we help you?

13:54.168 --> 13:57.754
Is there somebody else
working here today who's a little older?

13:57.838 --> 14:01.592
Don't be fooled. We're older than we look.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.260
Why, I'm nearly nine.

14:03.385 --> 14:06.847
- And our combined ages equal over 45.
- Mmm-hmm.

14:07.097 --> 14:12.686
And if you count, Petey,
it's 103 in dog years.

14:13.270 --> 14:16.356
So, what can me
and my staff do you for today?

14:16.440 --> 14:20.068
I need a large birthday cake by 5:00.

14:20.194 --> 14:24.281
Don't worry. Our expert
bakers can have it ready for you in time.

14:24.364 --> 14:27.201
- What kind of cake do you want?
- Red velvet.

14:29.286 --> 14:32.789
- You want a cake made out of velvet?
- Yuck!

14:32.873 --> 14:34.958
Yes, red velvet.

14:35.876 --> 14:38.962
Okey-dokey. It'll be ready by 5:00.

14:39.213 --> 14:41.715
- 5:00 sharp.
- Okay. Thanks!

14:42.549 --> 14:45.052
5:00? But Grandma won't be back in time.

14:45.135 --> 14:47.596
That's why we're going
to make it ourselves.

14:48.138 --> 14:50.766
But what do you know about making cakes?

14:50.807 --> 14:54.645
How hard can it be?
I've been eating 'em my whole life.

14:57.105 --> 14:59.483
First off, a little vanilla.

15:02.319 --> 15:03.779
And flour.

15:07.282 --> 15:08.825
Don't forget the sugar.

15:09.159 --> 15:12.162
More. More. Just a little more.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.458
Perfect.

15:17.084 --> 15:19.127
Isn't this gonna be a little too sweet?

15:19.169 --> 15:22.965
No such thing as
too sweet when you're talking about cakes.

15:23.173 --> 15:24.508
Don't forget the eggs.

15:26.343 --> 15:28.846
Had to go out to
the garage to find it, but I got the oil.

15:28.929 --> 15:32.015
Hey. As long as it says
oil, it'll do the trick.

15:37.354 --> 15:38.814
- What's that?
- Yeast.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.524
It's something my mom always puts in cakes.

15:40.649 --> 15:42.693
It makes the cake grow big.

15:42.818 --> 15:45.362
Well, this woman wanted a big cake.
So let's put it all in.

15:46.196 --> 15:47.698
Got the main ingredient.

15:54.705 --> 15:59.209
Our red velvet cakes
are made with 100% pure red velvet.

15:59.334 --> 16:00.878
And how!

16:05.382 --> 16:07.801
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

16:08.135 --> 16:09.178
Mmm.

16:09.303 --> 16:13.640
I sure could go for one of those
delicious-looking cupcakes.

16:13.724 --> 16:16.059
But Spanky says
we can't eat the merchandise.

16:16.185 --> 16:17.394
We're not gonna eat them,

16:17.519 --> 16:20.480
we're just gonna test them out
to make sure they're still good.

16:25.152 --> 16:26.361
Well, this one's good.

16:26.403 --> 16:27.905
This one, too.

16:28.030 --> 16:29.323
Better test the rest.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.033
Good idea.

16:39.374 --> 16:41.752
This is gonna be some cake.

16:41.835 --> 16:43.420
Yeah.

16:48.884 --> 16:51.595
Well,
I've reviewed your paperwork, Mrs. Larson,

16:51.678 --> 16:53.388
and I'm very sorry,

16:53.430 --> 16:57.726
but you owe this bank $10,000,
and it is past due.

16:57.768 --> 17:01.772
You must pay it back or we will be
forced to take away your bakery.

17:02.439 --> 17:06.401
Oh. Would you like to
try one of my chocolate chip cookies?

17:06.859 --> 17:08.028
Ooh.

17:08.111 --> 17:10.948
No. No, I'm trying to watch my calories.

17:11.949 --> 17:13.909
Now, about the loan.

17:13.951 --> 17:16.411
Well, I don't think one would hurt.

17:16.453 --> 17:18.288
I mean, they're from my bakery,

17:18.413 --> 17:21.791
and you would just be doing due diligence.

17:29.967 --> 17:32.427
I'm sorry about not paying back the money,

17:32.469 --> 17:35.305
but if you could
just give me a little bit more time.

17:35.556 --> 17:37.391
Mmm...

17:37.724 --> 17:39.268
Oh, my gosh.

17:39.309 --> 17:41.770
That's the best
chocolate chip cookie I've ever had.

17:41.812 --> 17:44.481
It's got just the right
crunchy to chewy ratio.

17:44.565 --> 17:46.733
Ooh, I'm so glad you like them.

17:46.817 --> 17:47.943
This isn't a cookie.

17:48.777 --> 17:50.153
It's nirvana.

17:50.279 --> 17:51.655
It's bliss.

17:52.072 --> 17:53.156
It's a warm puppy.

17:53.240 --> 17:56.326
It's sleeping late on a summer morning,

17:56.451 --> 17:59.496
or walking barefoot on the beach at sunset.

18:00.107 --> 18:02.308
If this cookie were a woman,
I would ask it to marry me.

18:02.332 --> 18:04.501
You see? With a cookie like this,

18:04.626 --> 18:06.795
business is just bound to pick up.

18:06.837 --> 18:11.133
And I'm sure I could
pay back the $10,000 in two months.

18:11.675 --> 18:14.469
- Would you like another one?
- Yes. What? No.

18:14.511 --> 18:17.347
Look, I'm sorry, Mrs. Larson,
but you've already had three extensions.

18:17.431 --> 18:18.682
My hands are tied.

18:18.807 --> 18:22.186
You simply must pay back the
$10,000 by the end of the month.

18:22.269 --> 18:24.438
But that's only two weeks away.

18:24.521 --> 18:26.815
- Maybe it's time you retired.
- Oh.

18:26.857 --> 18:28.025
Yes, sell the bakery.

18:28.192 --> 18:29.526
Do what makes you happy.

18:30.611 --> 18:33.030
I'm happiest when I'm baking.

18:33.655 --> 18:35.032
Well...

18:41.747 --> 18:42.998
Do you mind?

18:43.874 --> 18:45.834
They're just so good.

18:53.592 --> 18:55.844
Our work here is done.

18:55.886 --> 18:57.763
What shall we have for dessert?

18:58.180 --> 18:59.723
Hmm? More!

19:01.934 --> 19:04.686
I can't wait to
see the expression on Grandma's face

19:04.728 --> 19:07.689
when she sees
how we made a cake on our own.

19:14.571 --> 19:16.949
I don't like the sound of that.

19:17.115 --> 19:18.242
Me neither.

19:21.912 --> 19:23.580
Is it supposed to be doing that?

19:30.087 --> 19:31.630
What was that?

19:31.755 --> 19:34.258
Sounds like a moose trying to sing.

19:34.383 --> 19:36.093
Maybe it's Alfalfa.

19:36.218 --> 19:38.637
Come on, let's go check it out.

19:40.556 --> 19:42.099
Take cover!

20:15.465 --> 20:16.633
Kids?

20:17.134 --> 20:20.179
I think we used a teeny bit too much yeast!

20:20.637 --> 20:21.930
You think?

20:21.972 --> 20:23.182
What do we do?

20:23.307 --> 20:25.976
Don't worry. I'll just
take some air out of it.

20:26.852 --> 20:28.312
Uh-oh.

20:29.354 --> 20:30.981
- Kids?

20:33.483 --> 20:34.902
Oh. Are you all right?

20:36.486 --> 20:38.989
Oh, my goodness.

20:39.114 --> 20:40.824
What happened?

20:46.205 --> 20:48.332
Guess that means the cake's ready.

20:56.298 --> 20:58.050
What a mess you are.

20:58.175 --> 21:01.178
- It was a delicious mess.
- Oh, good.

21:02.012 --> 21:04.556
- What's Waldo doing here?
- Where?

21:10.854 --> 21:11.897
Oh.

21:12.356 --> 21:14.858
Oh, this is sweet.

21:15.234 --> 21:16.318
Oh.

21:16.693 --> 21:17.903
Mrs. Larson?

21:18.153 --> 21:20.989
Ray Kaye, but my friends call me Big Ray,

21:21.031 --> 21:22.533
because I think big.

21:22.658 --> 21:24.535
Well, what can I do for you, Mr. Kaye?

21:24.660 --> 21:28.163
No, no, no. It's what can I do for you.

21:28.330 --> 21:31.166
I understand that your property here,
its loan is coming due.

21:31.208 --> 21:33.710
And I'm here to offer you
a business proposition.

21:33.919 --> 21:36.547
And I'm consulting on the deal.

21:36.588 --> 21:37.923
He's so cute.

21:38.048 --> 21:43.387
I'm gonna offer you
$100,000 here and now if you sell it to me.

21:43.929 --> 21:45.264
$100,000!

21:45.389 --> 21:47.266
That's a lot of money.

21:47.683 --> 21:50.769
Now, that's a...
That's a lot of cute little people.

21:50.894 --> 21:52.521
You wanna buy my bakery?

21:52.896 --> 21:54.231
Yes, I do.

21:54.439 --> 21:56.233
- Why?
- Progress.

21:56.358 --> 21:58.902
Look, here is your bakery right now.

21:58.944 --> 22:01.446
And as you can see, it's old, it's rundown,

22:01.572 --> 22:04.241
it's desperately in need of a face-lift.
And here's my plan.

22:04.283 --> 22:07.911
We're gonna tear it all down
and then in its place, this.

22:09.079 --> 22:11.290
Say, what happened to Grandma's bakery?

22:11.415 --> 22:12.875
Yeah!

22:12.916 --> 22:15.252
Who's that? It's you again.
Little short stack.

22:15.419 --> 22:18.755
I'll tell you what happened.
Mixed-use development.

22:18.881 --> 22:22.593
Retail stores, office space, luxury
apartments. All very modern.

22:22.718 --> 22:23.886
A mall?

22:23.969 --> 22:25.971
Oh, no, no, no.

22:26.096 --> 22:29.433
Not a mall. A Big Ray's Malltopia.

22:29.558 --> 22:31.638
All glass and steel.
It's gonna kick this sleepy city

22:31.643 --> 22:33.270
right in the 21st century.

22:33.395 --> 22:35.939
What, you're just gonna
tear down my bakery?

22:36.565 --> 22:37.774
No, no, no, no, no.

22:37.816 --> 22:41.445
No, I wanna offer you a very fair price,

22:41.820 --> 22:42.988
then tear it down.

22:43.113 --> 22:44.448
What about the tree house, Dad?

22:44.573 --> 22:45.782
No, don't worry about
the tree house, Waldo.

22:45.824 --> 22:47.242
We'll uproot the tree and the tree house,

22:47.284 --> 22:49.578
and we'll have it moved
right into our backyard.

22:49.620 --> 22:51.163
That's our tree house.

22:51.288 --> 22:53.081
Yeah!

22:53.290 --> 22:55.417
Not after my dad buys it.

22:55.459 --> 22:57.461
Then it will be my tree house.

22:58.086 --> 22:59.171
Members only.

22:59.630 --> 23:03.300
And none of you will be members.

23:03.425 --> 23:04.927
Isn't he cute?

23:04.968 --> 23:09.473
I'm sorry, Mr. Kaye,
but I can't imagine closing this place. No.

23:09.973 --> 23:12.768
See, my grandparents started this business.

23:13.310 --> 23:16.146
Oh, well, you can sell it to me,
or lose it to the bank in two weeks.

23:16.271 --> 23:18.482
Unless, of course, I don't know,

23:18.607 --> 23:20.776
you got $10,000 lying around. No.

23:21.276 --> 23:23.320
Look, you're gonna get a much better deal

23:23.362 --> 23:25.113
from me than you will from the bank.

23:25.155 --> 23:27.282
Well, I have two weeks to raise the money.

23:27.533 --> 23:29.493
Until then, I won't sell.

23:29.535 --> 23:32.287
Well, I'm just trying to
be the good guy here.

23:33.038 --> 23:35.499
All right. Have it your way.

23:36.041 --> 23:37.876
Two weeks. Bye-bye.

23:39.795 --> 23:44.341
Grandma, you owe the bank $10,000?

23:44.466 --> 23:45.509
Yes.

23:46.844 --> 23:47.970
I know.

23:48.011 --> 23:49.304
When we win the talent show, Grandma,

23:49.346 --> 23:51.682
we'll just give you the $10,000.

23:51.807 --> 23:52.891
Oh.

23:53.016 --> 23:55.352
Yeah. That's first prize.

23:55.394 --> 23:58.313
Did you hear
what we sounded like this afternoon?

23:58.355 --> 23:59.481
We were terrible.

23:59.523 --> 24:00.732
Speak for yourself.

24:00.858 --> 24:02.359
She's right.

24:02.734 --> 24:05.028
We'll never win the talent show.

24:05.696 --> 24:06.989
Sorry, Grandma.

24:07.030 --> 24:08.657
That's okay, kids.

24:08.699 --> 24:13.370
Please excuse me,
but I think I'm gonna clean up the kitchen

24:13.453 --> 24:16.290
while I still have a kitchen to clean.

24:23.172 --> 24:24.548
What are we gonna do?

24:24.673 --> 24:26.884
Not only will Grandma lose her bakery,

24:26.967 --> 24:29.553
but we're gonna lose our
tree house to Waldo.

24:29.636 --> 24:30.679
Hold on.

24:34.349 --> 24:36.393
I have a great idea

24:36.977 --> 24:41.315
and I'm gonna give it to you in one word.

24:41.690 --> 24:43.233
Jobs.

24:57.247 --> 24:58.999
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

25:16.600 --> 25:17.893
Hey, guys.

25:20.270 --> 25:21.688
Thank you!

25:22.439 --> 25:24.525
Oh, come on!

25:44.878 --> 25:46.296
Mr. Kaye!

25:47.381 --> 25:49.216
Here they are, gentlemen.

25:49.591 --> 25:50.634
Your new caddies.

25:51.218 --> 25:52.803
Is this some kind of a joke?

25:52.886 --> 25:54.972
I'm sorry,
but three of my caddies called in sick.

25:55.055 --> 25:56.723
They're all I've got right now.

25:57.975 --> 26:00.477
Haven't I seen you
two guys somewhere before?

26:01.770 --> 26:03.897
Where would you have seen us before?

26:03.981 --> 26:06.149
Yeah, we travel in
different social circles.

26:06.316 --> 26:08.485
I don't know. They're awful short.

26:09.319 --> 26:11.960
Hey, as long as they can carry a bag,
what difference does it make?

26:12.656 --> 26:15.075
Okay, let's go. We're late.
Come on, grab the bags.

26:16.159 --> 26:18.620
Now you two do exactly what Mr. Kaye says

26:18.662 --> 26:21.123
or you're out of a job. Understand?

26:21.164 --> 26:22.624
Yes, sir.

26:23.500 --> 26:26.003
Oh, Edgar, how did you
manage having lunch here?

26:26.128 --> 26:27.754
You're not even a member of this club.

26:27.838 --> 26:30.174
Let's just say
I have a few friends in high places.

26:30.257 --> 26:31.341
Oh, you mean the Chief?

26:31.466 --> 26:33.177
Yep, that's one.

26:33.302 --> 26:35.012
Ooh, fancy.

26:36.597 --> 26:40.684
Man, this working
for a living sure is a lot of work.

26:41.018 --> 26:43.937
Yeah, I think
I'm more cut out for executive work.

26:44.021 --> 26:46.023
You know, with a corner office.

26:46.106 --> 26:47.191
You said it, pal.

26:49.985 --> 26:51.862
Oh, Ed, this is lovely.

26:51.987 --> 26:54.031
Well, it is a special occasion.

26:54.323 --> 26:56.033
After all, we've been dating for

26:56.158 --> 26:58.994
one year, five months, three
weeks, four days and nine hours.

26:59.203 --> 27:00.829
But who's counting.

27:02.873 --> 27:05.375
Well, every minute of
it has been wonderful.

27:05.834 --> 27:07.544
It has, hasn't it?

27:10.881 --> 27:12.508
Who does he think he is, a pro?

27:12.549 --> 27:14.134
I don't know, but he sure is lame.

27:14.218 --> 27:16.178
It's gonna go...

27:16.803 --> 27:19.139
- That's exactly what it's gonna do.
- Yeah. Yeah.

27:19.223 --> 27:21.016
- I'm sorry, it's not gonna work.
- Lame.

27:21.058 --> 27:22.392
Maybe you'd like to share with us

27:22.518 --> 27:24.144
some of your golfing expertise.

27:24.686 --> 27:28.357
With pleasure. Watch and learn.

27:28.899 --> 27:31.068
Oh, good. I can't wait.

27:31.151 --> 27:33.487
Show him how it's done, Spank.

27:42.746 --> 27:43.830
Hmm.

27:46.041 --> 27:47.835
Hmm. Mmm!

27:48.001 --> 27:49.586
- Ooh.
- Mmm.

27:51.046 --> 27:52.246
You're not getting any taller.

27:53.215 --> 27:55.384
Simmer down, hot sauce.

27:57.208 --> 27:59.489
June, there's something
that I've been wanting to ask you.

27:59.513 --> 28:00.597
Yes, Edgar?

28:04.393 --> 28:05.602
Fore!

28:05.727 --> 28:07.104
June, will you...

28:13.735 --> 28:14.903
Ed, are you hurt?

28:14.945 --> 28:16.345
What in the world is going on here?

28:16.864 --> 28:19.616
I got hit by a golf ball.

28:20.617 --> 28:23.620
It came from over there.

28:27.291 --> 28:28.584
Kids.

28:28.625 --> 28:29.877
Those kids!

28:30.043 --> 28:31.795
Quick, Spank. Ditch the evidence.

28:33.964 --> 28:35.132
Oh.

28:40.554 --> 28:42.055
Fore.

28:44.266 --> 28:47.144
And stay out. You're fired!

28:47.311 --> 28:48.312
Ugh!

28:52.149 --> 28:54.151
What are we going to do now?

28:54.276 --> 28:56.778
Yeah, we all got fired from our jobs.

28:57.112 --> 29:00.741
Alfalfa and me didn't
get fired, we resigned.

29:01.283 --> 29:03.785
- Working conditions were terrible.
- Mmm-hmm.

29:04.119 --> 29:08.332
Okay, but how are we
gonna raise enough money to help Grandma?

29:08.790 --> 29:13.170
Nobody ever got rich
working for somebody else, right?

29:13.253 --> 29:14.505
Right.

29:14.588 --> 29:17.925
So we're going to start our own business.

29:18.175 --> 29:20.844
- Our own business? What kind of business?
- Hmm.

29:21.845 --> 29:23.388
Let me think.

29:26.767 --> 29:28.060
What's up, Petey?

29:30.354 --> 29:32.898
Petey just gave me an idea.

29:35.526 --> 29:37.361
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

29:38.111 --> 29:39.613
Hi, Alfalfa.

29:39.696 --> 29:40.781
Hi, Darla.

29:41.615 --> 29:45.285
Five whole dollars? I'm not sure.

29:45.494 --> 29:47.371
That seems like an awful lot of money.

29:47.704 --> 29:50.916
What exactly do you
get for five whole dollars?

29:50.999 --> 29:54.503
The question really is, what don't you get?

29:54.586 --> 29:59.258
Here at Komplete Pet Kare,
our expert staff will provide your pet

29:59.341 --> 30:02.386
with the finest services
known to man or beast.

30:02.594 --> 30:05.514
For the price of just $5,

30:05.597 --> 30:09.268
our deluxe spa package
includes pet walking and washing.

30:09.351 --> 30:11.103
But wait, there's more.

30:11.436 --> 30:14.898
Your pet will also be
groomed by our patented Groom-O-Lator.

30:15.607 --> 30:18.360
Well, that does seem very nice,

30:18.443 --> 30:21.613
but Princess Flufferina
means the world to me.

30:22.656 --> 30:25.200
And I've never left her
with anyone else before.

30:25.284 --> 30:27.619
She's my prized pet.

30:27.703 --> 30:30.622
You have nothing to worry about, Darla.
She's in good hands.

30:30.706 --> 30:33.709
In fact, people call me the Cat Whisperer.

30:34.751 --> 30:36.003
Hi there, kitty.

30:38.422 --> 30:41.717
Spanky here will escort
Princess Flufferina to the spa.

30:41.800 --> 30:43.510
Bye, Alfalfa.

30:43.969 --> 30:45.137
Bye.

30:45.345 --> 30:49.016
Come on, Romeo, time to make some moolah.

30:50.100 --> 30:51.727
How's the grooming going, Mary Ann?

30:51.810 --> 30:53.103
- Yeah?
- Pretty good.

30:53.604 --> 30:57.024
It took a while because he kept
trying to hide in his shell,

30:57.107 --> 30:59.026
but look at that smile now.

30:59.109 --> 31:00.444
Show them, Cecil.

31:02.112 --> 31:03.280
How are the fish comin'?

31:03.363 --> 31:05.449
They're on the rinse cycle.

31:05.532 --> 31:08.911
But I need both your help
bathing and grooming the other animals.

31:08.994 --> 31:12.664
- Alfalfa, fire up the Groom-O-Lator.
- Why can't you fire it up?

31:12.915 --> 31:16.210
- 'Cause I'm the leader. I'm supervising.

31:19.421 --> 31:21.632
Ready, Petey? Here we go.

31:37.898 --> 31:38.941
Here you go.

31:40.609 --> 31:42.861
First stop, the rinse station.

31:44.821 --> 31:47.616
Next stop, the soap-down station.

31:51.578 --> 31:55.332
Then onto the rub-a-dub-dub scrub station.

32:00.504 --> 32:03.841
After that, the dry-o-matic station.

32:05.259 --> 32:09.012
And finally, a little perfume
to make them smell sweet.

32:12.182 --> 32:13.684
Fresh and clean.

32:15.435 --> 32:19.565
If this isn't a license to print money,
I don't know what is.

32:19.731 --> 32:21.525
I gotta say, I had my doubts at first,

32:21.608 --> 32:23.277
but when you're right, you're right.

32:24.570 --> 32:27.155
Hey, Spanky, when you're done
signing autographs,

32:27.489 --> 32:29.074
we need more soap.

32:29.157 --> 32:30.325
Okay, okay.

32:30.701 --> 32:34.329
The way I figure it, if
we can see 50 pets a day,

32:34.413 --> 32:37.833
we'll have Grandma's money in no time flat.

32:38.584 --> 32:39.710
Here's another one.

32:41.587 --> 32:45.048
- Ready for grooming.
- Ready for grooming.

32:45.132 --> 32:47.926
Okay, guys, load up the other pets.

32:48.010 --> 32:50.429
- We've got a lot of animals to groom.
- Gotcha.

33:01.565 --> 33:03.942
Oh, Ed, this is lovely.

33:04.026 --> 33:06.986
I can't believe that you put this whole
thing together on your lunch break.

33:07.237 --> 33:10.157
Well, our last date didn't go so well,

33:10.240 --> 33:13.535
and there was something I wanted
to ask you before we got

33:14.119 --> 33:15.162
interrupted.

33:15.412 --> 33:17.372
Ask me anything, Officer Kennedy.

33:18.207 --> 33:19.249
Okay.

33:19.791 --> 33:21.793
Let's go to the park, little doggies.

33:21.877 --> 33:23.170
Giddy up.

33:23.921 --> 33:24.963
Whoa.

33:25.130 --> 33:26.256
Whoa, whoa! Slow down!

33:26.590 --> 33:28.675
Well, Miss Crabtree.

33:29.843 --> 33:32.763
I mean, June...

33:32.846 --> 33:34.473
- Officer Kennedy.
- Oh.

33:34.598 --> 33:36.850
- Hi, Miss Crabtree!
- Hi, Officer Kennedy!

33:36.934 --> 33:38.310
Are you guys having a picnic?

33:38.393 --> 33:39.686
- Yeah, a picnic.

33:42.439 --> 33:44.566
Here you go, little guy.

33:53.367 --> 33:54.535
Hold still!

34:08.799 --> 34:12.678
Spanky, maybe
you should handle Princess Flufferina?

34:12.969 --> 34:15.764
It's just a cat, not a mountain lion.

34:15.973 --> 34:19.601
All I know is, when Darla sees
how well I took care of her cat,

34:19.685 --> 34:22.228
she's gonna find me irresponsible.

34:22.312 --> 34:25.690
Don't you mean irresistible?

34:25.774 --> 34:27.860
Irresistible. Irresistible.

34:28.360 --> 34:30.027
Yeah, that, too.

34:36.243 --> 34:38.829
Oh, no. Guys, look.

34:41.206 --> 34:44.751
The machine is turning them all green.

34:48.422 --> 34:49.672
Remarkable.

34:49.840 --> 34:51.550
What did you do, Mary Ann?

34:51.675 --> 34:53.594
What do you mean, "What did I do?"

34:53.677 --> 34:56.013
You're the one that put the soap in.

34:56.388 --> 34:59.349
Look! It's green dye.

34:59.433 --> 35:01.435
You distracted me, Mary Ann.

35:02.227 --> 35:03.687
Oh, no. Darla's cat!

35:05.189 --> 35:08.692
Wait, come back! Watch out!

35:10.110 --> 35:12.112
Hurry! Make it stop.

35:20.370 --> 35:23.040
Mmm. That chocolate sure looks good.

35:23.081 --> 35:24.791
- Oh, would you like one?
- Yeah!

35:24.875 --> 35:26.716
No, no, no, no.
Those chocolates are expensive.

35:26.877 --> 35:28.629
Oh, there's plenty here.

35:28.712 --> 35:31.215
Here, take some.
Now, are these all your dogs?

35:31.298 --> 35:34.051
Nah, we're just
walking 'em to make money for Grandma.

35:34.092 --> 35:37.804
Aw, that is so nice.
Isn't that nice, Edgar?

35:37.888 --> 35:38.972
Uh, yeah, that's lovely.

35:39.056 --> 35:40.557
Now I'm sure you have
a lot of other dogs to walk,

35:40.599 --> 35:42.226
- so take chocolates to go. Okay?
- Oh.

35:48.315 --> 35:49.483
Oh. Oh...

35:49.566 --> 35:50.651
Ooh!

35:50.734 --> 35:53.946
No, sit! Stop, stop. No! Sit, doggie.

35:54.071 --> 35:57.115
No. Mush. No! No, no mush!
No, come on, sit, stop.

35:57.241 --> 35:58.742
No. No.

36:03.580 --> 36:06.416
Good thing that lamppost was there
to stop him.

36:06.500 --> 36:07.501
Mmm-hmm.

36:09.253 --> 36:10.420
Kids.

36:12.297 --> 36:14.842
Come back. If you don't like green,

36:14.925 --> 36:17.928
we can make them any other color you want.

36:18.262 --> 36:21.849
Alfalfa, what happened to you?

36:22.099 --> 36:24.643
Oh, just been working hard.

36:24.768 --> 36:27.855
I'm here to pick up Princess Flufferina.
Is she ready?

36:29.815 --> 36:31.275
Sure.

36:31.358 --> 36:34.695
And wait until you see
her exciting new look.

36:35.112 --> 36:36.280
What new look?

36:37.698 --> 36:41.451
Here you go. One Princess Flufferoni.

36:47.791 --> 36:49.459
Darla hates me now.

36:49.543 --> 36:52.004
At least we made a little
money for Grandma,

36:52.212 --> 36:54.214
thanks to my great idea.

36:54.298 --> 36:56.633
No, we actually lost money.

36:56.717 --> 36:59.469
Yeah, all the pet owners
wanted their money back.

36:59.553 --> 37:02.139
Did I mention Darla hates me now?

37:02.472 --> 37:05.517
Don't worry, I'll think of something else.

37:05.642 --> 37:07.978
- What?
- Yeah, what?

37:08.020 --> 37:09.521
I'm thinking.

37:10.022 --> 37:12.524
- Anything yet?
- No.

37:12.858 --> 37:14.651
Now? How about now? Anything yet?

37:15.319 --> 37:17.196
Not yet.

37:17.863 --> 37:18.989
Now? How about now?

37:19.072 --> 37:22.326
Don't rush me. Genius takes time.

37:23.535 --> 37:27.164
- Grandma!
- Hi, kids, I got some good news.

37:27.206 --> 37:33.003
I sold off some old stock,
and I was able to raise $5,000.

37:33.337 --> 37:36.048
That's great, Grandma.

37:36.131 --> 37:37.716
You're almost halfway there.

37:37.841 --> 37:41.720
And if I can drum up enough business,
I think I can get the rest.

37:41.845 --> 37:44.515
But I need your help.

37:44.598 --> 37:46.183
Sure, Grandma, no problem.

37:46.517 --> 37:50.854
Would you mind
handing out these flyers all over town?

37:51.897 --> 37:53.023
Sure. You bet!

37:53.190 --> 37:54.608
- Yay!

38:07.412 --> 38:08.539
Guys?

38:09.039 --> 38:11.542
What are they doing here?

38:14.795 --> 38:17.256
Hey. What do you think you're doing?

38:17.923 --> 38:20.634
Which color do you
think would look better for the tree house?

38:20.717 --> 38:23.720
Caribbean green or Georgia peach?

38:23.804 --> 38:25.430
It's fine just the way it is.

38:25.556 --> 38:28.058
Desiree doesn't think so. Do you, Desiree?

38:28.433 --> 38:29.476
Desiree?

38:30.644 --> 38:32.062
My decorator.

38:32.312 --> 38:34.439
This dump is gonna need a total makeover

38:34.565 --> 38:36.942
when my father moves it to our back yard.

38:37.442 --> 38:39.903
So, how do you even get in here?

38:40.112 --> 38:42.155
I wouldn't do that.

38:42.239 --> 38:44.116
The burglar alarm is set.

38:44.241 --> 38:47.119
A burglar alarm? On this dump?

38:47.411 --> 38:48.787
Get real.

38:53.917 --> 38:55.836
I told you.

38:55.919 --> 38:57.671
Yeah, he told you.

38:58.589 --> 39:00.257
That's hilarious.

39:08.599 --> 39:10.601
I really don't like him.

39:10.934 --> 39:12.311
Me neither.

39:12.686 --> 39:14.313
Me three-ther.

39:15.355 --> 39:19.109
No time to waste, men.
We're gonna distribute these flyers.

39:19.151 --> 39:22.279
And then I'm gonna come up
with another great plan

39:22.362 --> 39:25.449
to make money for Grandma.
Now, let's go. Come on!

39:25.532 --> 39:27.117
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

39:59.399 --> 40:03.070
<i>I call on you, my friend
A helping hand you lend</i>

40:03.153 --> 40:05.489
<i>In my time of need</i>

40:05.864 --> 40:07.491
<i>Whenever I'm down</i>

40:08.200 --> 40:11.995
<i>I call on you, my friend
I call on you, my friend</i>

40:12.538 --> 40:14.164
<i>I call on you, my friend</i>

40:14.706 --> 40:16.792
<i>Whenever I'm down</i>

40:17.125 --> 40:21.129
<i>I call on you, my friend
A helping hand you lend</i>

40:21.171 --> 40:23.173
<i>In my time of need</i>

40:23.715 --> 40:25.175
<i>Whenever I'm down</i>

40:25.968 --> 40:29.847
<i>I call on you, my friend
I call on you, my friend</i>

40:32.224 --> 40:34.184
<i>Whenever I'm down</i>

40:34.852 --> 40:36.812
<i>And all that's going on</i>

40:36.854 --> 40:38.689
<i>Is really going on</i>

40:38.814 --> 40:41.191
<i>Just one of those days in joy</i>

40:41.316 --> 40:45.404
<i>You say the right things
To keep me moving on</i>

40:45.904 --> 40:48.657
<i>To keep my going strong
Going strong, going strong</i>

40:48.699 --> 40:50.033
Hey, Alfalfa!

40:50.158 --> 40:51.410
Hi, Darla!

41:00.586 --> 41:02.379
Are you all right?

41:02.713 --> 41:05.757
I've died and gone to heaven.

41:06.550 --> 41:09.511
Actually, this is Maple Street.

41:09.553 --> 41:10.596
Let me help you up.

41:14.099 --> 41:16.101
You have a nice voice.

41:16.518 --> 41:18.395
Thanks. You have a nice voice, too.

41:18.562 --> 41:20.606
Why, thank you, Alfalfa.

41:20.898 --> 41:24.860
I'm really sorry about your cat.
I hope you're not still mad.

41:25.110 --> 41:26.195
It's all right.

41:26.236 --> 41:30.032
When my friends saw
Princess Flufferina, they got jealous.

41:30.073 --> 41:33.619
So now they all want green cats, too.

41:33.744 --> 41:35.787
Hey, are you going to the library?

41:36.079 --> 41:39.875
Yeah. I love books about cats. See?

41:40.125 --> 41:43.045
<i>Cats and You, Illustrated History of Cats,</i>

41:43.086 --> 41:45.923
<i>Heroic Cats, Great Cats of the Civil War.</i>

41:46.298 --> 41:49.927
Can I give you
a ride to the library on my bike?

41:50.594 --> 41:52.930
Yeah. That would be very nice of you.

41:54.598 --> 41:56.808
Hey, the gang and I, we have a band,

41:58.227 --> 42:00.437
the International
Silver String Submarine Band.

42:00.562 --> 42:02.606
- I.S.S.S.B. for short.
- Oh.

42:02.648 --> 42:05.651
And I was wondering
if you'd like to sing with us

42:05.776 --> 42:07.319
in the talent show next week.

42:07.945 --> 42:10.781
I'd love to, Alfalfa,

42:10.822 --> 42:13.951
but I already agreed
to be in the talent show with Waldo.

42:14.159 --> 42:15.494
Waldo?

42:20.290 --> 42:21.625
- Hi, Darla.

42:21.834 --> 42:24.461
Look at what my dad just bought me.

42:24.795 --> 42:26.088
Waldo!

42:26.338 --> 42:28.465
It's beautiful!

42:31.134 --> 42:33.971
Isn't it? Want to go for a ride?

42:34.346 --> 42:37.307
Do I? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

42:37.349 --> 42:39.643
But I thought we were going to the library.

42:39.768 --> 42:41.478
That's okay, I'll take her.

42:41.603 --> 42:43.313
I'd offer you a ride, too,

42:43.355 --> 42:46.817
but clearly there's not
enough room for three.

42:49.319 --> 42:51.613
Sorry. Bye, Alfalfa.

43:01.039 --> 43:03.041
Hold it! Hold it.

43:03.167 --> 43:05.836
And what happened to our lead singer?

43:06.003 --> 43:09.798
Darla and I could have
made such beautiful music together.

43:10.215 --> 43:12.885
What does she see in Waldo
and that car of his?

43:13.010 --> 43:16.305
Forget about her.
We need to rehearse for the talent show.

43:16.346 --> 43:18.849
But you don't
know how hard it is to get a girlfriend

43:18.974 --> 43:20.142
when you don't have wheels.

43:20.184 --> 43:21.226
- Hmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

43:22.686 --> 43:24.855
Wheels? Wheels!

43:25.189 --> 43:28.567
I've got it. I have my next great idea.

43:29.568 --> 43:31.403
- What do you have in mind?
- Yeah.

43:31.987 --> 43:34.031
Not only will we make money for Grandma,

43:34.072 --> 43:36.533
but you can impress Darla.

43:45.876 --> 43:49.213
Hey, Darla. Like a ride to the library?

43:49.546 --> 43:53.509
Alfalfa? Where did you get that?

43:53.926 --> 43:57.179
Me and the gang made it.
It's our new taxi cab service.

43:57.554 --> 43:59.097
What does it even run on?

44:02.726 --> 44:03.894
Petey power.

44:04.394 --> 44:06.855
And it gets 3 miles to the bone.

44:14.404 --> 44:16.365
So would you like a ride to the library?

44:16.406 --> 44:19.284
It's for a good cause,
to save Grandma's bakery.

44:19.576 --> 44:22.246
Okay, I'd love a ride.

44:26.750 --> 44:29.586
Hey! I'm supposed to drive Darla.

44:29.795 --> 44:33.924
Sorry, Waldo,
but Alfalfa already offered to take me.

44:36.093 --> 44:38.428
I'd offer you a ride, Waldo,

44:38.554 --> 44:42.057
but, clearly, there's not enough room.

44:42.099 --> 44:44.268
- Let's roll, Stymie.
- See ya.

45:00.284 --> 45:02.077
Home base calling dispatch.

45:02.119 --> 45:04.121
<i>Home base calling dispatch. Come in.</i>

45:04.204 --> 45:05.789
Dispatch here. What's up, Spank?

45:05.914 --> 45:07.916
Tickets are selling like hotcakes.

45:07.958 --> 45:11.295
When are you guys coming back
to pick up the next batch of passengers?

45:11.420 --> 45:13.714
Be back in an jiff.
Got one more stop to make at Walnut,

45:13.797 --> 45:15.048
then one more at the library.

45:15.132 --> 45:17.718
- Great. Over and out.
- Over and out.

45:21.471 --> 45:24.600
Step right up, folks.
One dollar for the ride of your life.

45:24.641 --> 45:28.145
This taxi's great, Alfalfa. I love it.

45:31.315 --> 45:33.442
Oh, no. It's Butch and Worm.

45:34.109 --> 45:35.277
Uh-oh.

45:36.737 --> 45:38.906
Well, well, well.

45:39.323 --> 45:41.408
Nice set of wheels you got here.

45:41.491 --> 45:42.910
Yeah, nice.

45:43.285 --> 45:46.163
Fancy running into you on our street.

45:46.830 --> 45:49.249
How's about giving me and Worm a ride?

45:49.458 --> 45:53.003
- Huh?
- Okay, Butch. That'll be one dollar.

45:53.128 --> 45:56.507
I was thinking more like you pay me.

45:56.673 --> 45:59.218
How much you got on you?

45:59.426 --> 46:01.595
A robbery.

46:04.264 --> 46:05.349
Yes!

46:06.016 --> 46:08.435
You guys are gonna get it now.

46:08.644 --> 46:11.021
- Hey, look. The cops!
- Where?

46:12.606 --> 46:13.690
Whoa!

46:16.610 --> 46:18.946
- Yeah!
- That was awesome, Alfalfa.

46:19.029 --> 46:21.198
I'm gonna get you guys.

46:21.990 --> 46:24.535
See ya! Wouldn't wanna be ya!

46:27.204 --> 46:28.705
See you later, guys!

46:33.377 --> 46:35.546
Next stop, Walnut Street.

46:36.046 --> 46:38.632
And we have officially arrived.

46:42.386 --> 46:44.721
Thank you for riding
with Komplete Taxi, sir.

46:44.847 --> 46:46.306
Tell all your friends.

46:46.390 --> 46:48.976
- Next customer?
- Here, here, here, here. Thank you.

46:49.184 --> 46:51.854
Ladies and gents,
it'll be a few minutes.

46:51.895 --> 46:53.730
Gotta cool off the engine.

46:53.856 --> 46:55.399
How about a little music, Darla?

46:55.524 --> 46:57.067
- Sure.
- Okay.

47:18.922 --> 47:21.925
Okay, Petey.
This ought to wet your whistle.

47:39.026 --> 47:43.614
Alfalfa? Do you suppose
you could change the station?

47:44.615 --> 47:46.241
Of course, no problem.

47:58.921 --> 48:01.298
Can't it play anything else?

48:01.882 --> 48:03.091
Sure.

48:04.092 --> 48:06.720
<i>With a moo moo here
And a moo moo there</i>

48:06.803 --> 48:09.056
<i>Here a moo, there a moo
Everywhere a moo moo</i>

48:09.139 --> 48:13.227
<i>Old MacDonald had a farm E-I-E-I-O</i>

48:13.310 --> 48:14.978
Can't you play anything else?

48:15.103 --> 48:17.231
It's the only song I know.

48:19.483 --> 48:22.778
We'll just have to enjoy
the silence for a while.

48:22.819 --> 48:25.280
Okay, everybody. All set to go.

48:31.578 --> 48:34.414
Next stop, the library.

48:37.918 --> 48:39.670
Have a nice trip.

48:41.338 --> 48:43.298
Ladies and gentlemen,

48:43.340 --> 48:46.677
we will be arriving
at our destination in five minutes.

48:46.802 --> 48:50.013
But in the meantime,
please allow me to be your tour guide

48:50.138 --> 48:53.016
pointing out all the
sights of our fair city.

48:53.100 --> 48:54.852
On the left, you will see the home

48:54.977 --> 48:56.687
of 11-year-old Freddie Gillespie,

48:56.812 --> 49:00.274
the only person to
eat 27 Atomic FireBalls at once

49:00.357 --> 49:02.526
and live to tell the tale.

49:02.651 --> 49:05.821
Alfalfa, aren't we going a little fast?

49:06.029 --> 49:08.532
Don't worry, we're fine.
This is the express taxi.

49:09.700 --> 49:11.869
- Uh...
- And on your right, you will see the very spot

49:11.994 --> 49:13.829
where Miss Mugilicutty's rottweiler ate...

49:13.871 --> 49:17.499
- Alfalfa?
- Stymie, I'm conducting a tour here.

49:17.541 --> 49:20.335
- It's important.
- What's so important that it can't wait?

49:21.712 --> 49:23.130
No brakes!

49:24.006 --> 49:25.048
No brakes?

49:26.842 --> 49:30.387
I'm too young
and handsome to die.

49:32.723 --> 49:34.474
- Watch out!

49:38.312 --> 49:41.732
- Stymie! Do something!
- Like what?

49:41.815 --> 49:43.525
Like don't crash!

49:45.903 --> 49:47.321
Slow down!

49:47.404 --> 49:49.031
Speed up!

49:52.910 --> 49:54.745
Watch out! Get out of the way!

49:54.828 --> 49:55.913
Whoa! Hey!

50:01.376 --> 50:03.754
- Watch the road!
- I can't see!

50:09.927 --> 50:11.887
Hurry. Be careful!

50:13.597 --> 50:14.681
Hurry!

50:18.018 --> 50:19.811
- Watch out!

50:34.535 --> 50:37.579
Oh, remember this spot?
It's where we first met.

50:37.955 --> 50:39.039
Aw.

50:39.122 --> 50:42.292
That's right. You gave
me a parking citation.

50:42.626 --> 50:43.752
Oh.

50:43.794 --> 50:45.087
That's right. I did.

50:45.128 --> 50:48.257
Oh, it's okay, Ed. It
was dismissed in court.

50:48.590 --> 50:49.633
- Oh.

50:49.758 --> 50:52.970
Yeah, yeah. Well, I mean,
technically... I did.

50:53.053 --> 50:56.473
Attention passengers,
the taxi is arriving at Gate 1.

50:56.598 --> 50:58.725
Please have your tickets
ready to give to the...

51:00.978 --> 51:02.729
Come on, guys!

51:04.147 --> 51:06.483
Anyway, uh, June.

51:06.733 --> 51:11.321
We've been spending a lot of time
together and I've been thinking...

51:12.948 --> 51:14.408
- Oh.
- June.

51:14.491 --> 51:15.909
What's that?

51:16.159 --> 51:17.327
I don't know.

51:17.411 --> 51:19.663
- All right, stay here, I'll handle this.
- Oh.

51:24.960 --> 51:26.253
Get out of the way.

51:26.336 --> 51:28.589
- Watch out!
- Hey, you kids!

51:33.468 --> 51:34.511
Whoa...

51:47.524 --> 51:49.193
Is everyone all right?

51:49.693 --> 51:51.278
What happened?

51:54.656 --> 51:56.200
Are you guys okay?

51:56.283 --> 51:58.368
I think we need a tow truck.

51:58.493 --> 52:01.079
That was amazing! Let's do it again!

52:02.706 --> 52:05.209
My ring! Where's my ring?

52:09.379 --> 52:12.424
I'm so sorry, Darla.
I don't know what went wrong.

52:12.549 --> 52:14.510
What went wrong was me accepting

52:14.551 --> 52:16.595
this ride from you in this death trap.

52:17.596 --> 52:19.389
You kids have really done it!

52:19.890 --> 52:21.600
Do you know how many laws you've broken?

52:21.725 --> 52:23.393
I have had it with you kids!

52:23.519 --> 52:26.605
Edgar, calm down. They're just children.

52:26.730 --> 52:29.942
They're not children. They're monsters.

52:30.067 --> 52:32.569
Public menaces. Dangers to society.

52:32.611 --> 52:34.738
They're future criminals.

52:34.780 --> 52:37.032
Sorry, Officer Kennedy.

52:38.200 --> 52:39.910
He seems a little mad.

52:41.912 --> 52:44.790
Darla, I heard the crash.
Are you all right?

52:44.915 --> 52:47.376
Thank you, Waldo. I'm fine.

52:47.543 --> 52:49.044
Just a little dizzy.

52:49.086 --> 52:51.880
We were just trying
to make money for Grandma's bakery.

52:51.922 --> 52:53.298
I don't wanna hear your excuses.

52:53.423 --> 52:56.385
And if I had my way, I'd lock each
one of you up in jail right now

52:56.426 --> 52:58.804
and save the world
a whole lot of trouble in the future.

52:58.929 --> 53:00.722
You know what, Edgar?

53:01.056 --> 53:04.393
I don't think
you and I should see each other anymore.

53:04.434 --> 53:06.270
What? Why not?

53:06.770 --> 53:10.649
What kind of future do I have with a man
who doesn't even like children?

53:11.942 --> 53:13.569
- Goodbye!
- Junebug.

53:14.444 --> 53:15.946
Junebug, I like kids...

53:15.988 --> 53:17.072
From a distance.

53:17.447 --> 53:19.783
Would you like that ride
to the library now?

53:19.825 --> 53:21.493
With pleasure.

53:22.327 --> 53:23.787
Darla, wait.

53:27.833 --> 53:30.335
Hope you have insurance, Alfalfa.

53:42.681 --> 53:45.475
Officer Kennedy, I found this.

53:45.601 --> 53:47.436
I thought you might want it back.

53:48.353 --> 53:51.523
Women.
I don't think I'll ever understand them.

53:51.648 --> 53:53.192
Join the club.

53:59.823 --> 54:01.533
<i>Well, I don't know</i>

54:01.658 --> 54:02.701
<i>If all that's true</i>

54:02.826 --> 54:06.955
<i>'Cause you got me and baby, I got you</i>

54:09.500 --> 54:10.667
<i>Babe</i>

54:11.835 --> 54:15.172
Hold it, hold it. That sounded terrible.

54:15.839 --> 54:18.383
Alfalfa, what's the problem?

54:18.509 --> 54:20.677
The problem is I don't got the babe.

54:20.719 --> 54:23.639
And I don't got Darla.
I'm too depressed to sing.

54:23.972 --> 54:25.849
Face it, Spank, we're never gonna be

54:25.974 --> 54:27.851
ready in time for the talent show.

54:27.893 --> 54:30.854
And we're never gonna make enough
money to save Grandma's bakery.

54:30.896 --> 54:32.356
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

54:32.481 --> 54:35.692
Okay, so we had a little
setback with the taxi service.

54:35.817 --> 54:39.363
A little setback? We lost money again.

54:39.863 --> 54:42.574
And I lost Darla again.

54:42.699 --> 54:45.369
To Waldo. Boy, do I hate that guy.

54:45.410 --> 54:48.038
Want another reason to hate him?

54:48.705 --> 54:51.917
Look. The brake lever from the taxi cab.

54:52.459 --> 54:55.128
The cables didn't snap, they were cut.

54:56.255 --> 54:59.633
And who would want to
see us fail more than anyone?

54:59.800 --> 55:03.053
- Waldo.
- Exactly.

55:03.095 --> 55:05.931
That's it. I'm gonna
tear him limb from limb.

55:06.056 --> 55:08.225
Boy, Waldo messed with the wrong guy.

55:08.308 --> 55:10.102
And he's gonna be sorry he did.

55:10.227 --> 55:13.438
'Cause I'm a caged tiger. A hurricane.

55:13.564 --> 55:16.441
And when someone crosses me, they unleash

55:16.942 --> 55:18.735
the sledgehammer!

55:23.574 --> 55:24.992
Did I win?

55:26.952 --> 55:31.164
Alfalfa, you're a genius.
You've given me a great idea.

55:31.248 --> 55:33.834
How we can raise money
and help you get Darla back.

55:34.418 --> 55:36.587
Isn't that what you said last time?

55:36.628 --> 55:38.463
And the time before that?

55:38.589 --> 55:39.840
Yeah.

55:39.923 --> 55:43.135
This time, it's a sure thing.

55:50.434 --> 55:52.269
Here you are, Darla.

55:52.352 --> 55:56.356
One refreshing
jumbo strawberry fizz supreme.

55:56.815 --> 55:58.275
Two straws.

55:58.692 --> 56:00.694
Thank you, Waldo. It's so nice of you.

56:00.777 --> 56:03.322
Anything for my partner in the talent show.

56:04.031 --> 56:06.783
You and I are going to be unstoppable.

56:08.785 --> 56:11.371
Come see
the wrestling match of the century.

56:11.455 --> 56:15.292
- Tell your friends!
- Alfalfa versus the Masked Marvel.

56:15.792 --> 56:18.462
Yeah, you don't want to miss it.

56:18.504 --> 56:20.130
One day only.

56:21.381 --> 56:25.219
Alfalfa's gonna wrestle the Masked Marvel?

56:26.053 --> 56:27.346
Sounds dangerous.

56:27.471 --> 56:30.557
Sounds ridiculous.
He couldn't wrestle a teddy bear.

56:31.141 --> 56:34.811
I think he's pretty brave to do this.

56:35.479 --> 56:37.981
Something fishy here.

56:38.190 --> 56:40.526
Would you excuse me a moment, Darla?

56:40.651 --> 56:42.653
Well, of course, Waldo.

56:44.821 --> 56:47.574
Alfalfa is gonna
beat the Masked Marvel.

56:47.658 --> 56:49.409
Yeah, tell your friends.

56:49.493 --> 56:50.994
Excuse me, my good man.

56:51.203 --> 56:55.040
You don't happen to know
who this Masked Marvel is, do you?

56:55.165 --> 56:57.042
Yeah. But it's a secret.

56:57.167 --> 57:00.587
Yeah, a big secret.
Spanky told us we're not supposed to tell.

57:00.671 --> 57:02.089
I don't believe it.

57:02.172 --> 57:05.175
Spanky would never tell you
who the Masked Marvel is.

57:05.259 --> 57:06.760
You're too little.

57:06.844 --> 57:08.679
We're not too little. We know.

57:08.762 --> 57:11.515
Yeah, we know exactly who it is.

57:11.598 --> 57:12.891
My friend,

57:13.851 --> 57:17.104
Abraham Lincoln here, says you don't.

57:17.521 --> 57:21.400
I bet you $5
you don't know who the Masked Marvel is.

57:21.692 --> 57:23.944
Yeah? Well, guess what.

57:24.027 --> 57:26.405
I'm going to be the Masked Marvel.

57:26.530 --> 57:30.117
Yeah, Porky's gonna be the Masked Marvel.
Now pay up.

57:30.284 --> 57:32.911
Well, you guys sure showed me.

57:33.370 --> 57:36.707
Here, don't spend it all on gum balls.

57:41.628 --> 57:43.172
- Yes!
- Yeah!

57:44.590 --> 57:45.674
Gentlemen.

57:46.800 --> 57:49.011
Who you callin' a gentleman?

57:49.386 --> 57:50.888
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

57:51.305 --> 57:53.473
I'm here to make you a proposition.

57:53.557 --> 57:56.351
Yeah? What kind of proposition?

57:56.435 --> 57:58.729
Yeah? What kind of proposition?

57:58.812 --> 58:00.397
The best kind.

58:00.772 --> 58:02.482
A profitable one.

58:02.816 --> 58:03.901
Give me that.

58:05.360 --> 58:07.487
Oh, there's more where that came from.

58:08.572 --> 58:10.240
Follow me, there's a secret entrance.

58:10.324 --> 58:11.575
Hurry, I hope it hasn't started yet.

58:11.658 --> 58:12.784
I don't wanna miss it.

58:12.868 --> 58:15.454
- Me neither.
- Two tickets, please.

58:15.537 --> 58:17.456
Thanks for inviting me, Waldo.

58:17.539 --> 58:20.042
Normally, I abhor violence,

58:20.250 --> 58:22.794
but this seemed too good to miss.

58:23.170 --> 58:25.506
Enjoy the match. Next!

58:28.300 --> 58:30.344
Popcorn! Get your popcorn!

58:30.427 --> 58:34.806
Can't enjoy a wrestling match
without a big old bag of popcorn.

58:36.016 --> 58:37.392
Thank you.

58:40.270 --> 58:42.272
Popcorn! Get your popcorn!

58:42.439 --> 58:43.857
Welcome to the match.

58:45.108 --> 58:46.193
Welcome.

58:47.152 --> 58:49.279
Psst. Spank. How we doing so far?

58:49.363 --> 58:51.073
Great. We got a full house.

58:51.156 --> 58:52.950
Boy, are we gonna clean up.

58:56.078 --> 58:58.121
- I'll take that.

58:58.580 --> 59:00.666
I paid good money for that.

59:05.921 --> 59:10.467
I just hope Alfalfa doesn't
hurt the Masked Marvel too badly.

59:10.551 --> 59:13.804
Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.

59:23.355 --> 59:26.900
Hey, this area is for wrestlers only.

59:27.150 --> 59:30.112
- There's been a change of plan.
- Yeah.

59:33.282 --> 59:34.867
Hello, Spanky.

59:35.367 --> 59:38.745
Waldo? I didn't think of you
as the wrestling type.

59:39.913 --> 59:42.124
I couldn't pass up the opportunity

59:42.207 --> 59:45.627
to see the Masked Marvel
wipe the floor with Alfalfa.

59:45.711 --> 59:48.088
Oh, yeah?
You're gonna be disappointed, Waldo.

59:48.172 --> 59:50.632
There's no way Alfalfa's going to lose.

59:50.716 --> 59:53.343
Oh, really? Care to make it interesting?

59:53.635 --> 59:55.262
What do you mean?

59:55.846 --> 59:59.349
I'll bet you all the money
you've made from collecting admissions

59:59.433 --> 01:00:02.561
that Alfalfa is going to lose.

01:00:04.438 --> 01:00:06.690
You're on, Waldo. It's a bet.

01:00:17.701 --> 01:00:19.244
Sucker.

01:00:23.457 --> 01:00:25.083
Showtime, Porky.

01:00:25.167 --> 01:00:28.128
Wow, Porky. The costume looks great on you.

01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:31.215
You even look taller.

01:00:32.132 --> 01:00:34.718
Oh, and remember,
when I give you the high sign,

01:00:34.843 --> 01:00:36.470
that's your cue to take a dive. Got it?

01:00:47.356 --> 01:00:50.234
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:00:50.317 --> 01:00:54.738
Welcome to the world
championship wrestling match of all time.

01:01:03.497 --> 01:01:06.750
Are you ready to wrestle?

01:01:10.337 --> 01:01:15.175
In this corner,
the most dangerous man in wrestling.

01:01:15.425 --> 01:01:20.764
Let's hear it
for the undefeated "Wildcat" Alfalfa.

01:01:25.727 --> 01:01:28.272
Alfalfa! Alfalfa!

01:01:28.772 --> 01:01:32.401
How is he undefeated
if he's never wrestled before?

01:01:32.442 --> 01:01:34.528
That's why he's undefeated.

01:01:35.195 --> 01:01:36.280
Ah...

01:01:36.405 --> 01:01:38.949
In this corner, his opponent,

01:01:39.074 --> 01:01:41.952
the most feared man in wrestling.

01:01:42.077 --> 01:01:45.038
The man, the myth, the legend,

01:01:45.122 --> 01:01:48.208
the Masked Marvel!

01:01:50.961 --> 01:01:53.213
Whoo! Go, Masked Marvel!

01:01:56.925 --> 01:01:59.386
Okay, men, bring it in. Shake hands.

01:01:59.469 --> 01:02:01.763
Men, I wanna see a fair fight.

01:02:02.389 --> 01:02:04.641
Good luck and may the best man win.

01:02:04.766 --> 01:02:06.643
And remember, Porky, make it look real.

01:02:13.483 --> 01:02:15.110
And, fight.

01:02:16.153 --> 01:02:17.487
Yeah! Alfalfa!

01:02:17.571 --> 01:02:19.114
Ooh, yeah!

01:02:27.497 --> 01:02:28.665
Oh.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.460
- Ooh.

01:02:33.504 --> 01:02:35.130
Are you okay?

01:02:35.172 --> 01:02:36.757
He knows he's supposed to lose, right?

01:02:37.007 --> 01:02:39.009
Yeah. He's just makin' it look good.

01:02:39.092 --> 01:02:40.761
Now get back in there, champ.

01:02:41.345 --> 01:02:43.347
Go, Alfalfa!

01:02:45.807 --> 01:02:47.518
Go, Masked Marvel.

01:02:47.684 --> 01:02:49.186
Okay, Masked Marvel.

01:02:49.311 --> 01:02:52.606
Get ready for my
signature move, the pulverizer.

01:02:52.689 --> 01:02:55.025
It puts the "ow" in pow!

01:03:02.199 --> 01:03:05.202
Alfalfa! Alfalfa!

01:03:13.043 --> 01:03:16.046
Alfalfa! Alfalfa!

01:03:28.183 --> 01:03:31.061
Holy guacamole. What happened?

01:03:35.232 --> 01:03:36.233
Hmm?

01:03:41.113 --> 01:03:42.239
And, fight.

01:03:42.698 --> 01:03:45.075
Alfalfa! Alfalfa!

01:03:50.914 --> 01:03:52.207
Yes!

01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:54.877
Whoa!

01:03:58.130 --> 01:03:59.423
Porky.

01:04:00.257 --> 01:04:02.467
Don't you see he's giving
you the high sign?

01:04:02.593 --> 01:04:04.928
- Oh, I can't watch!
- I can.

01:04:05.929 --> 01:04:07.431
You're supposed to make it look real.

01:04:09.391 --> 01:04:10.601
Not that real!

01:04:12.769 --> 01:04:15.272
I don't remember this as part of the plan.

01:04:15.397 --> 01:04:16.773
Me neither.

01:04:18.984 --> 01:04:19.985
Spanky!

01:04:20.068 --> 01:04:21.987
- Spanky! Spanky!

01:04:23.614 --> 01:04:25.490
- Psst.

01:04:26.450 --> 01:04:27.618
Alfalfa.

01:04:31.121 --> 01:04:33.624
If Porky's there, then who's...

01:04:37.794 --> 01:04:38.962
Butch.

01:04:40.172 --> 01:04:42.132
- Butch!

01:04:47.513 --> 01:04:50.641
Run, Alfalfa, run! Run for your life!

01:05:03.779 --> 01:05:05.322
Ooh!

01:05:06.156 --> 01:05:07.950
What are you doing?

01:05:18.293 --> 01:05:19.336
Ooh!

01:05:20.045 --> 01:05:21.171
Oh, no.

01:05:24.633 --> 01:05:27.386
Yeah! And the winner is Butch!

01:05:32.391 --> 01:05:35.853
This isn't fair.
You cheated by putting Butch in the match.

01:05:37.062 --> 01:05:40.190
And you cheated
by rigging the match with Porky.

01:05:40.232 --> 01:05:42.025
I just cheated better.

01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:44.528
But don't worry, it's
going to a good cause.

01:05:44.862 --> 01:05:48.490
I'm going to use the money
to put a security system in the tree house,

01:05:49.032 --> 01:05:51.535
so I can keep you all out for good.

01:05:51.994 --> 01:05:53.495
Come on, Darla.

01:05:55.747 --> 01:05:57.374
Sorry, Alfalfa.

01:05:58.041 --> 01:06:01.003
You lost all our money, Spank?

01:06:01.170 --> 01:06:03.922
How come you didn't ask us
before you did that?

01:06:04.047 --> 01:06:05.382
Yeah!

01:06:05.549 --> 01:06:07.718
Because I'm the leader and I had to make

01:06:07.843 --> 01:06:10.179
a split-second, executive decision.

01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:12.055
I almost got killed for nothing.

01:06:12.181 --> 01:06:14.683
Okay, so I made a bad call.

01:06:14.725 --> 01:06:16.810
But don't worry. I'll come up with one

01:06:16.894 --> 01:06:18.937
of my great ideas any second now.

01:06:19.062 --> 01:06:21.440
Every time you come
up with one of your great ideas,

01:06:21.565 --> 01:06:22.900
something bad happens.

01:06:22.941 --> 01:06:24.067
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:06:24.109 --> 01:06:26.653
Well, someone has
to do the thinking around here.

01:06:26.904 --> 01:06:30.908
You guys would be helpless without me.
Right, Alfalfa?

01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:34.411
Alfalfa?

01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:35.954
They're right, Spank.

01:06:36.079 --> 01:06:39.666
We're all supposed to act as a team,
but you never act that way.

01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:40.792
Ever.

01:06:40.918 --> 01:06:44.254
And now, thanks to you,
it's too late to save Grandma's bakery.

01:06:44.338 --> 01:06:47.007
It's over. We lost. Come on, guys.

01:06:48.342 --> 01:06:50.594
Hey. Where are you going? Come back.

01:06:50.802 --> 01:06:52.679
We still have a little time left.

01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:55.432
Porky? Buckwheat?

01:06:55.974 --> 01:06:58.769
You're too bossy, Spanky.

01:06:58.810 --> 01:07:00.646
Yeah, too bossy.

01:07:03.023 --> 01:07:04.107
Petey?

01:07:50.988 --> 01:07:52.698
Oh, Spanky!

01:07:54.908 --> 01:07:57.536
Want a muffin? It's hot.

01:07:57.661 --> 01:08:00.831
No, thanks, Grandma. I'm not really hungry.

01:08:01.665 --> 01:08:03.667
A Rascal doesn't want a muffin?

01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:06.044
I've never heard of that before.

01:08:08.172 --> 01:08:10.340
Never get tired of this.

01:08:11.008 --> 01:08:12.176
Oh...

01:08:13.218 --> 01:08:16.013
I'm gonna miss this old bakery.

01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:19.183
I'm really sorry, Grandma.

01:08:19.265 --> 01:08:22.352
Been trying so hard to
make money to save it.

01:08:22.728 --> 01:08:28.024
Spanky, I do appreciate
all of you trying to help me, honey.

01:08:28.942 --> 01:08:31.236
But you're losing your bakery.

01:08:31.778 --> 01:08:34.113
And we're losing our tree house.

01:08:34.198 --> 01:08:37.783
You have your friends.
That's what's important.

01:08:37.868 --> 01:08:40.953
Not anymore. They're all mad at me.

01:08:41.078 --> 01:08:42.747
They say I'm bossy.

01:08:42.872 --> 01:08:44.917
Well, is that true?

01:08:45.042 --> 01:08:48.629
I'm not bossy. I just
tell people what to do.

01:08:49.046 --> 01:08:51.881
That sounds kind of bossy to me.

01:08:52.716 --> 01:08:55.219
Well, someone has to give the orders.

01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:57.970
Otherwise, nothing would ever get done.

01:08:58.055 --> 01:09:01.934
A good leader has to be
also a good listener.

01:09:02.059 --> 01:09:06.104
'Cause you can't just give orders.
You have to inspire.

01:09:06.772 --> 01:09:09.358
What difference does it make now?

01:09:09.483 --> 01:09:11.276
They don't need me anymore.

01:09:11.359 --> 01:09:14.696
Oh, they do need you, and you need them.

01:09:16.073 --> 01:09:17.491
Let me show you something.

01:09:20.118 --> 01:09:22.453
This is pure cocoa powder.

01:09:22.537 --> 01:09:23.538
I want you to smell it.

01:09:25.791 --> 01:09:28.210
Mmm, smells great.

01:09:28.292 --> 01:09:30.796
And now, try to taste it.

01:09:36.718 --> 01:09:38.428
Yuck. It tastes bitter.

01:09:38.511 --> 01:09:41.014
That's because it's cocoa.

01:09:41.098 --> 01:09:44.100
And not until it gets mixed in
with all those other ingredients

01:09:44.184 --> 01:09:47.062
does it become a wonderful cupcake.

01:09:49.022 --> 01:09:53.151
Okay, but what does
this have to do with me and my friends?

01:09:53.234 --> 01:09:55.195
Well, it's because you and your friends

01:09:55.279 --> 01:09:57.614
are like the ingredients of my cupcakes.

01:09:58.156 --> 01:10:00.617
Not until you all come together

01:10:00.701 --> 01:10:03.120
do you become something wonderful.

01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:15.799
Oh, June. June! I was
just coming to see you.

01:10:15.883 --> 01:10:16.967
We need to talk.

01:10:17.050 --> 01:10:19.511
I think we've
said everything we need to say, Edgar.

01:10:19.595 --> 01:10:22.723
No, then I need to say more.
I can't sleep, I miss you.

01:10:22.806 --> 01:10:24.308
Junebug, I miss you. And I feel terrible

01:10:24.391 --> 01:10:26.351
- about the way I acted the other day.
- Oh?

01:10:26.435 --> 01:10:28.770
I'm really, really sorry
about what I said to the kids.

01:10:28.854 --> 01:10:31.064
It's just every time they're around,

01:10:31.148 --> 01:10:34.776
our dates get ruined, bad things happen
to us, every time.

01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:36.069
Well, they're just children, Edgar.

01:10:36.153 --> 01:10:38.033
They're not trying to
make your life miserable.

01:10:38.071 --> 01:10:39.823
They don't have to try, they're succeeding.

01:10:40.038 --> 01:10:41.718
Oh, if you can't be patient with children,

01:10:41.742 --> 01:10:43.035
you shouldn't date a school teacher.

01:10:43.118 --> 01:10:46.330
I'll be patient.
I'll be patient. Just give me a chance.

01:10:46.413 --> 01:10:48.290
I know I can be the kind of guy you want,

01:10:48.373 --> 01:10:51.376
the kind of guy that likes kids.

01:10:51.502 --> 01:10:53.462
Loves... I love kids.

01:10:53.545 --> 01:10:55.214
Let me prove it.

01:10:55.672 --> 01:10:58.884
You wanna prove it?
Well, tonight is the kids' talent show.

01:10:58.967 --> 01:11:00.719
How would you like to be my date?

01:11:02.554 --> 01:11:03.972
Are those kids gonna be there?

01:11:04.056 --> 01:11:06.517
Yes, Edgar, those kids.

01:11:07.643 --> 01:11:09.478
You wanted a chance to prove yourself.

01:11:11.271 --> 01:11:13.857
That sounds great.

01:11:14.024 --> 01:11:15.651
- Good.
- I love kids.

01:11:15.734 --> 01:11:17.069
Now, are those flowers for me,

01:11:17.152 --> 01:11:18.695
or are they just there
to make you look pretty?

01:11:18.779 --> 01:11:21.823
No, they're for you. And the balloons.

01:11:24.368 --> 01:11:26.662
- I like chocolate, too.
- Okay, okay.

01:11:26.954 --> 01:11:28.705
Ready to commence? Here we go.

01:11:28.789 --> 01:11:31.416
Two, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:33.502
And here we go, spinning in an orbit

01:11:33.585 --> 01:11:35.671
like the Mars Rover and spinning out.

01:11:35.754 --> 01:11:38.841
Spinning in and dipsy-doodle.

01:11:39.508 --> 01:11:41.677
Stop. Stop. Stop.

01:11:41.885 --> 01:11:44.471
- What's wrong?
- It's very nice, Waldo.

01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:47.057
But when you make this gesture...

01:11:49.768 --> 01:11:53.146
I want to see a little more,
"I'm a pre-teen idol, worship me,"

01:11:53.230 --> 01:11:55.732
and a little less,
"I'm your next president, vote for me."

01:11:55.816 --> 01:11:57.693
Gotcha. Thanks, Sergio.

01:11:57.734 --> 01:12:00.863
Now, about you, Darla,
when you come out of the double spin,

01:12:00.904 --> 01:12:03.740
I want to see a bigger smile, like this.

01:12:08.662 --> 01:12:09.705
Ha!

01:12:11.748 --> 01:12:12.749
Bigger.

01:12:13.417 --> 01:12:14.501
Bigger.

01:12:14.918 --> 01:12:16.003
Bigger!

01:12:16.753 --> 01:12:18.213
That's it.

01:12:18.255 --> 01:12:20.424
My cheeks are starting to hurt.

01:12:22.009 --> 01:12:23.510
Trust me on this, honey.

01:12:23.594 --> 01:12:25.929
I was a smile consultant to presidents,

01:12:26.013 --> 01:12:28.265
captains of industry, and super models

01:12:28.348 --> 01:12:31.727
before I became
a choreographer and musical director.

01:12:31.768 --> 01:12:34.563
Darla, Sergio's the best there is.

01:12:34.605 --> 01:12:36.106
Okay.

01:12:37.065 --> 01:12:39.776
Now for the finale.

01:12:40.444 --> 01:12:42.279
I want you both to watch me

01:12:42.362 --> 01:12:43.947
very, very,

01:12:44.698 --> 01:12:48.952
very, very, very closely.

01:12:49.244 --> 01:12:50.621
One, two, three!

01:12:50.746 --> 01:12:53.290
Showgirl, showgirl, showgirl, showgirl.

01:12:53.415 --> 01:12:54.958
Huh? Huh? Huh?

01:12:55.042 --> 01:12:58.295
And the bunny hop!
Bunny hop! Bunny hop! Bunny hop!

01:12:58.420 --> 01:13:01.215
And the fishing.
We are fishing. We are fishing.

01:13:01.423 --> 01:13:03.467
The big one got away.

01:13:03.592 --> 01:13:07.304
And we go into the La-Z-Boy!

01:13:07.429 --> 01:13:09.473
And then the butterfly.

01:13:09.556 --> 01:13:10.599
Ooh!

01:13:10.766 --> 01:13:12.559
And for the big finish...

01:13:12.643 --> 01:13:14.061
Ha!

01:13:17.272 --> 01:13:20.984
Thank you. Thank you. Now, follow me.

01:13:21.235 --> 01:13:24.738
Your costumes have arrived
from the tailor in Paris.

01:13:32.621 --> 01:13:34.957
Remember when we carved these?

01:13:35.624 --> 01:13:38.585
It was the day we finished
building this place.

01:13:38.669 --> 01:13:42.589
Do you ever think we'll have another
tree house as good as this one?

01:13:42.673 --> 01:13:45.509
Even if we did, it wouldn't be this one.

01:13:49.346 --> 01:13:50.472
What do you want?

01:13:50.514 --> 01:13:54.685
Guys, we gotta go for broke.
We have to do the talent show.

01:13:54.768 --> 01:13:56.979
We don't take orders from you anymore.

01:13:57.020 --> 01:13:58.355
Yeah. You said it.

01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:00.983
We're tired of
being bossed around all the time.

01:14:01.024 --> 01:14:06.029
Okay, I admit that lately
on some select occasions,

01:14:06.613 --> 01:14:10.117
- I may have been a little on the bossy side.
- Huh?

01:14:11.368 --> 01:14:14.705
Okay, okay, I've been a
lot on the bossy side.

01:14:14.830 --> 01:14:16.331
You happy?

01:14:16.373 --> 01:14:19.835
And I shouldn't have bet that
money without asking you all first.

01:14:20.335 --> 01:14:22.671
- Hmm.
- But this is our last chance to save

01:14:22.713 --> 01:14:25.382
Grandma's bakery and our tree house.

01:14:25.799 --> 01:14:27.384
You're not the leader anymore.

01:14:27.509 --> 01:14:29.052
Well, then who is the leader?

01:14:29.553 --> 01:14:31.221
I guess we're all the leaders now.

01:14:31.346 --> 01:14:32.723
It's a democracy.

01:14:32.848 --> 01:14:34.975
Yeah, democracy.

01:14:35.559 --> 01:14:36.643
Fair enough.

01:14:36.727 --> 01:14:39.188
So I'd like to propose something

01:14:39.229 --> 01:14:41.690
to all the leaders of the club.

01:14:43.192 --> 01:14:47.487
The grand prize to the
talent show is $10,000.

01:14:47.738 --> 01:14:51.366
That's more than enough
to stop Big Ray and Waldo.

01:14:51.742 --> 01:14:53.368
But we've hardly practiced.

01:14:53.410 --> 01:14:55.579
And when we have, we've been terrible.

01:14:55.662 --> 01:14:56.872
Stinky.

01:14:56.914 --> 01:14:59.917
What chance do we
really have of winning that show?

01:15:01.251 --> 01:15:02.336
None, if we don't try.

01:15:04.546 --> 01:15:08.175
You know, this club
is like one of Grandma's cupcakes.

01:15:09.259 --> 01:15:11.553
You mean bad for our teeth?

01:15:11.762 --> 01:15:15.015
No. We're like the ingredients.

01:15:15.098 --> 01:15:17.601
Separately, we don't taste very good.

01:15:18.227 --> 01:15:21.772
- Huh?
- But together, we're like an awesome cupcake

01:15:22.731 --> 01:15:23.857
or something.

01:15:25.943 --> 01:15:29.071
All I'm saying is,
we're better together than we are apart.

01:15:29.530 --> 01:15:31.073
Now who's in?

01:15:31.281 --> 01:15:32.533
Anyone?

01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:34.117
Anyone?

01:15:58.767 --> 01:16:00.143
All right, guys,

01:16:00.227 --> 01:16:04.982
the International Silver String
Submarine Band is playing tonight.

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:07.234
Gather up your instruments.

01:16:07.442 --> 01:16:09.486
Okay!

01:16:18.287 --> 01:16:19.746
For Grandma.

01:16:19.830 --> 01:16:22.749
For Grandma!

01:16:25.169 --> 01:16:27.004
Come on, hurry, guys.

01:16:28.505 --> 01:16:30.299
Hello, Greenhaven!

01:16:31.008 --> 01:16:34.678
Please give a warm welcome
for our host with the most,

01:16:34.761 --> 01:16:37.181
Mr. Leo McCarey!

01:16:37.681 --> 01:16:38.765
<i>Thank you!</i>

01:16:39.641 --> 01:16:41.852
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:16:42.477 --> 01:16:43.687
<i>welcome</i>

01:16:44.271 --> 01:16:46.106
<i>to the talent show!</i>

01:16:52.362 --> 01:16:54.198
Who let you in here?

01:16:54.281 --> 01:16:58.952
Since it's a talent show, we thought
there ought to be some talent in it.

01:16:59.453 --> 01:17:00.871
Come on, Darla.

01:17:01.038 --> 01:17:02.956
Good luck, Alfalfa.

01:17:03.207 --> 01:17:05.709
You, too, Darla. I hope you win.

01:17:05.959 --> 01:17:07.711
Or at least come in second.

01:17:11.882 --> 01:17:13.967
<i>All right, then, help
me give a warm welcome</i>

01:17:14.051 --> 01:17:16.053
<i>to our esteemed panel of judges</i>

01:17:16.136 --> 01:17:20.349
<i>who will be deciding
which act is going to take home</i>

01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:25.020
<i>the $10,000 grand prize tonight!</i>

01:17:26.230 --> 01:17:29.191
<i>Our first act tonight,
an amazing duo of tap dancers.</i>

01:17:29.233 --> 01:17:33.570
<i>Please put your hands
together for Tap Tenacity.</i>

01:17:51.171 --> 01:17:53.048
They're really good.

01:17:53.257 --> 01:17:54.591
Uh-huh.

01:18:01.932 --> 01:18:03.600
Yeah, that was good.

01:18:04.893 --> 01:18:07.855
<i>Next on stage, please welcome</i>

01:18:07.938 --> 01:18:10.232
<i>McKible the Magnificent.</i>

01:18:12.192 --> 01:18:13.944
- For my first trick...
- No.

01:18:14.027 --> 01:18:16.530
I'll pull a rabbit out of this hat.

01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:18.282
Alakazam.

01:18:37.467 --> 01:18:41.638
I will now shuffle the deck
and magically make your card reappear.

01:18:44.224 --> 01:18:45.976
- Um, is that it?
- No.

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:48.270
- That one?
- No.

01:18:48.812 --> 01:18:50.564
- That one?
- No.

01:18:50.772 --> 01:18:51.982
Amateurs.

01:19:10.626 --> 01:19:12.503
For my grand finale,

01:19:12.586 --> 01:19:16.006
I will escape from these
solid steel handcuffs

01:19:16.131 --> 01:19:17.841
in three seconds.

01:19:18.842 --> 01:19:22.137
One, two, three.

01:19:30.979 --> 01:19:32.314
Ta-da!

01:19:39.530 --> 01:19:40.948
<i>- Mystical, wasn't it?</i>

01:19:41.031 --> 01:19:43.534
<i>Please help me welcome to the stage</i>

01:19:43.617 --> 01:19:46.286
<i>the new musical stylings</i>

01:19:46.370 --> 01:19:49.540
<i>- of Waldo and Darla.</i>

01:19:52.042 --> 01:19:55.045
Notice how Waldo's name is first.

01:19:55.128 --> 01:19:56.338
Mmm-hmm.

01:19:57.005 --> 01:19:58.674
<i>I've been a-searching</i>

01:19:58.715 --> 01:20:01.301
<i>All this big wide world</i>

01:20:01.468 --> 01:20:04.346
<i>Now finally I found</i>

01:20:04.388 --> 01:20:09.184
<i>My candy girl</i>

01:20:09.226 --> 01:20:12.020
<i>Candy girl</i>

01:20:13.730 --> 01:20:17.693
<i>I found me a girl</i>

01:20:17.734 --> 01:20:20.153
<i>Candy girl</i>

01:20:20.529 --> 01:20:25.534
<i>She sets my heart awhirl</i>

01:20:25.576 --> 01:20:27.911
<i>Candy girl</i>

01:20:27.995 --> 01:20:29.162
<i>With hugging</i>

01:20:29.246 --> 01:20:30.998
<i>- Hugging
- And kissing</i>

01:20:31.081 --> 01:20:34.668
<i>- Kissing
- And loving</i>

01:20:34.751 --> 01:20:37.171
We're fishing. The big one got away.

01:20:38.172 --> 01:20:39.840
- <i>Mine</i>
- <i>Mine</i>

01:20:40.215 --> 01:20:41.258
<i>Whoa</i>

01:20:41.550 --> 01:20:42.593
And he twirls her around.

01:20:48.515 --> 01:20:51.894
- They're super good.
- Yeah, I'd vote for them.

01:20:51.935 --> 01:20:53.187
- What?
- Okay, what?

01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:55.022
<i>Candy girl</i>

01:20:55.105 --> 01:21:00.110
- <i>She vows eternally</i>
- <i>Candy girl</i>

01:21:00.194 --> 01:21:02.279
Three, two, four.

01:21:02.404 --> 01:21:03.780
<i>To hold me</i>

01:21:03.864 --> 01:21:05.449
- <i>Hold me</i>
- <i>And love me</i>

01:21:05.574 --> 01:21:08.744
<i>- Love me
- Until the end of time</i>

01:21:09.953 --> 01:21:12.247
<i>- He's mine
- Mine</i>

01:21:12.289 --> 01:21:13.624
<i>- Mine
- Mine</i>

01:21:14.541 --> 01:21:17.085
<i>Whoa</i>

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:21.757
<i>Candy girl</i>

01:21:21.798 --> 01:21:24.760
<i>Candy girl</i>

01:21:31.934 --> 01:21:35.103
Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

01:21:36.522 --> 01:21:37.606
Number one!

01:21:37.689 --> 01:21:39.316
Bravo!

01:21:40.359 --> 01:21:41.485
Thank you.

01:21:41.568 --> 01:21:42.903
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:21:42.986 --> 01:21:44.196
Thank you.

01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:46.406
Thank you.

01:21:53.539 --> 01:21:54.790
<i>That was amazing.</i>

01:21:54.873 --> 01:22:00.045
<i>It looks like Waldo and Darla
are the act to beat.</i>

01:22:01.213 --> 01:22:04.842
Spanky, I don't think
we can compete with Waldo and Darla.

01:22:05.592 --> 01:22:08.053
Oh, come on.
What do they have that we don't?

01:22:08.470 --> 01:22:10.806
Uh, fancy costumes.

01:22:10.889 --> 01:22:12.599
Great choreography.

01:22:12.850 --> 01:22:14.643
And a pretty girl singer.

01:22:14.726 --> 01:22:17.229
Face it, we don't stand a chance.

01:22:17.563 --> 01:22:20.858
Okay, men.
Maybe we don't have all those things.

01:22:20.941 --> 01:22:23.068
Maybe Waldo has more money than we do.

01:22:23.151 --> 01:22:24.871
Maybe he has more of everything than we do.

01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:27.489
But this it. Let's go in there together,

01:22:27.573 --> 01:22:29.658
as a team and give it our best.

01:22:29.741 --> 01:22:31.535
At least we'll know we tried.

01:22:31.785 --> 01:22:33.120
<i>And now,</i>

01:22:33.203 --> 01:22:36.832
<i>last but certainly not least,</i>

01:22:37.416 --> 01:22:39.042
<i>our final act.</i>

01:22:39.334 --> 01:22:41.628
<i>I'm intrigued by their name when I saw it.</i>

01:22:42.254 --> 01:22:44.673
<i>Please welcome the one and only</i>

01:22:45.299 --> 01:22:51.138
<i>International Silver String Submarine Band.</i>

01:23:16.496 --> 01:23:17.789
<i>Hi, everybody.</i>

01:23:19.124 --> 01:23:22.628
<i>Tonight,
we're going to perform</i> I Got You, Babe.

01:23:22.711 --> 01:23:24.087
<i>It's an oldie, but a goodie.</i>

01:23:24.171 --> 01:23:28.550
<i>And we'd like to dedicate it
to a very special lady who's here tonight.</i>

01:23:29.009 --> 01:23:30.928
- Ready, gang?
- Ready.

01:23:34.348 --> 01:23:36.850
And a one and a two and a...

01:23:43.232 --> 01:23:46.276
<i>They say we're young
And we don't know</i>

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:51.073
<i>We won't find out until we grow</i>

01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:55.827
<i>Well, I don't know if all that's true</i>

01:23:55.911 --> 01:24:00.207
<i>'Cause you got me and baby, I got you</i>

01:24:02.793 --> 01:24:04.044
<i>Babe</i>

01:24:05.629 --> 01:24:07.047
<i>I got you, babe</i>

01:24:09.132 --> 01:24:10.467
<i>I got you, babe</i>

01:24:12.302 --> 01:24:18.141
<i>I got flowers In the spring</i>

01:24:18.767 --> 01:24:20.769
<i>I got you</i>

01:24:21.645 --> 01:24:24.690
<i>To wear my ring</i>

01:24:25.107 --> 01:24:28.235
<i>And when I'm sad</i>

01:24:28.318 --> 01:24:30.279
<i>You're a clown</i>

01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:34.658
<i>And if I get scared</i>

01:24:34.950 --> 01:24:37.828
<i>You're always around</i>

01:24:38.537 --> 01:24:41.623
<i>- Don't let them say your hair's too long</i>

01:24:41.707 --> 01:24:44.835
<i>'Cause I don't care
With you I can't go wrong</i>

01:24:44.918 --> 01:24:48.338
Excuse me a second.
I have to handle something.

01:24:48.422 --> 01:24:49.464
Okay.

01:24:49.548 --> 01:24:52.009
<i>Then put your little hand in mine</i>

01:24:52.092 --> 01:24:56.847
<i>There ain't no hill
Or mountain we can't climb</i>

01:24:58.682 --> 01:25:01.101
Waldo? What are you doing?

01:25:01.602 --> 01:25:03.270
Setting off the fire alarm.

01:25:03.353 --> 01:25:07.691
Those Silver String Slimeballs can't win
if they can't finish their act.

01:25:07.774 --> 01:25:09.568
But that would be cheating.

01:25:09.693 --> 01:25:13.030
That would be winning.
You want to win, don't you?

01:25:13.447 --> 01:25:17.409
It's not winning if you
don't win fairly, Waldo.

01:25:17.576 --> 01:25:21.705
I just can't believe
you would do something this sleazy.

01:25:21.872 --> 01:25:23.874
Like my dad always says,

01:25:23.957 --> 01:25:26.793
"It's not how you play the game,
it's winning that counts."

01:25:27.211 --> 01:25:28.879
Oh, no, you're not, Waldo.

01:25:28.962 --> 01:25:30.047
Huh?

01:25:32.132 --> 01:25:33.759
What kind of girl are you?

01:25:33.884 --> 01:25:36.720
The kind who doesn't like cheaters

01:25:36.803 --> 01:25:39.431
and who has a brown belt in karate.

01:25:41.266 --> 01:25:44.436
Doesn't matter. They'll never win anyways.

01:25:44.895 --> 01:25:47.272
<i>When I'm sad</i>

01:25:47.397 --> 01:25:50.400
<i>You're a clown</i>

01:25:50.609 --> 01:25:53.820
<i>And if I get scared</i>

01:25:53.904 --> 01:25:57.241
<i>You're always around</i>

01:25:57.908 --> 01:26:01.078
<i>Don't let them say your hair's too long</i>

01:26:01.119 --> 01:26:02.788
<i>'Cause I don't care</i>

01:26:02.913 --> 01:26:06.333
<i>With you I can't go wrong</i>

01:26:07.417 --> 01:26:11.088
<i>Then put your little hand in mine</i>

01:26:11.129 --> 01:26:15.801
<i>There ain't no hill
Or mountain we can't climb</i>

01:26:16.176 --> 01:26:17.427
Aw...

01:26:17.678 --> 01:26:18.846
<i>Babe</i>

01:26:20.472 --> 01:26:22.516
<i>I got you, babe</i>

01:26:23.767 --> 01:26:25.602
<i>I got you, babe</i>

01:26:26.812 --> 01:26:28.438
<i>I got you, babe</i>

01:26:30.315 --> 01:26:32.192
<i>I got you, babe</i>

01:26:34.111 --> 01:26:36.780
<i>I got you to hold my hand</i>

01:26:36.864 --> 01:26:40.284
<i>I got you to understand</i>

01:26:40.325 --> 01:26:43.036
<i>I got you to walk with me</i>

01:26:43.620 --> 01:26:46.790
<i>I got you to talk with me</i>

01:26:53.463 --> 01:26:56.675
<i>I got you</i>

01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:58.302
<i>Babe</i>

01:26:58.343 --> 01:26:59.469
Everybody!

01:27:01.221 --> 01:27:02.639
<i>I got you, babe</i>

01:27:04.641 --> 01:27:06.518
<i>I got you, babe</i>

01:27:07.728 --> 01:27:09.479
<i>I got you, babe</i>

01:27:11.231 --> 01:27:12.482
<i>I got you, babe</i>

01:27:14.359 --> 01:27:15.986
<i>I got you, babe</i>

01:27:17.696 --> 01:27:19.323
<i>I got you, babe</i>

01:27:20.991 --> 01:27:22.492
<i>I got you, babe</i>

01:27:23.869 --> 01:27:28.248
<i>I got you, babe</i>

01:27:49.186 --> 01:27:52.397
<i>Oh. Looks like the judges
have made their decision.</i>

01:27:55.901 --> 01:27:57.945
<i>And the winner is</i>

01:27:58.028 --> 01:28:00.864
<i>the International
Silver String Submarine Band!</i>

01:28:37.067 --> 01:28:38.402
Bravo!

01:28:38.443 --> 01:28:39.903
Grandma.

01:28:41.530 --> 01:28:44.741
Oh, you, kids. Thank you so much.

01:28:45.409 --> 01:28:47.409
How are we gonna fit this
check in the ATM machine?

01:28:49.079 --> 01:28:50.956
I don't know!

01:28:55.043 --> 01:28:57.963
Hey, Alfalfa. You were great tonight.

01:28:58.547 --> 01:29:00.257
Thanks. So were you.

01:29:00.382 --> 01:29:02.926
But what about Waldo?

01:29:03.260 --> 01:29:05.762
He just became a solo act.

01:29:05.929 --> 01:29:08.932
And I'm looking for a new band to sing in.

01:29:09.641 --> 01:29:11.393
Any ideas?

01:29:14.104 --> 01:29:16.940
Well, Mrs. Larson,
I hope you're proud of yourself.

01:29:17.274 --> 01:29:18.442
Not at all.

01:29:18.567 --> 01:29:21.111
I'm just so proud of my Little Rascals.

01:29:21.570 --> 01:29:23.322
Well, what about the tree house, Dad?

01:29:23.447 --> 01:29:25.157
I'll build you
another new tree house from the ground up.

01:29:25.282 --> 01:29:27.284
- But I want that tree house.
- Look, I've got a great architect.

01:29:27.409 --> 01:29:28.827
- I want... They don't deserve it! I do!
- You know.

01:29:28.952 --> 01:29:31.432
- I want! I want! I want it!
- I'll take care of it, all right?

01:29:31.622 --> 01:29:34.458
Congratulations, kids. You were great.

01:29:34.583 --> 01:29:35.959
You really were.

01:29:36.502 --> 01:29:39.796
I'm even thinking you could perform

01:29:39.838 --> 01:29:43.133
at the policemen's
Fourth of July picnic next month.

01:29:45.928 --> 01:29:47.346
That would be awesome.

01:29:47.679 --> 01:29:50.641
Or we could perform
at your wedding instead?

01:29:50.849 --> 01:29:53.602
Uh, my wedding?

01:29:54.978 --> 01:29:55.979
No. Alfalfa.

01:29:56.104 --> 01:29:58.148
Yeah, hasn't he asked you to marry him yet?

01:29:58.273 --> 01:30:00.150
He showed us the ring and everything.

01:30:00.442 --> 01:30:01.818
Uh...

01:30:03.654 --> 01:30:07.491
He certainly has, and I just told him...

01:30:08.492 --> 01:30:09.826
"Yes."

01:30:11.787 --> 01:30:13.038
- You have?

01:30:15.165 --> 01:30:16.458
She has.

01:30:16.708 --> 01:30:18.001
Yes?

01:30:21.171 --> 01:30:23.131
- Aw.

01:30:44.027 --> 01:30:46.738
- Hi, Grandma.
- Well, you're just in time.

01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:49.491
- Who wants muffins?
- Me!

01:30:50.993 --> 01:30:53.036
Get in line. Ready?

01:30:53.495 --> 01:30:54.538
Okay.

01:31:05.841 --> 01:31:07.176
I caught it.

01:31:07.426 --> 01:31:10.262
Thank you, Grandma!

01:31:11.930 --> 01:31:12.931
Here we go.

01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:18.187
Come on, gang.

01:31:39.917 --> 01:31:41.293
Wow!

01:31:42.085 --> 01:31:44.087
Home, sweet home.

01:31:44.254 --> 01:31:46.590
And how!

01:31:46.632 --> 01:31:47.758
And how.

01:34:08.899 --> 01:34:11.318
Keep your eyes closed. Ready?

01:34:13.862 --> 01:34:14.905
Wow.

01:34:15.072 --> 01:34:18.492
Yes, it is "wow." It's
got all the amenities.

01:34:18.575 --> 01:34:22.037
Central air and heat,
Italian marble floors, granite countertops.

01:34:22.538 --> 01:34:24.248
It's amazing, Dad.

01:34:24.373 --> 01:34:26.416
Yes, it is. Here, you do the honors.

01:34:28.752 --> 01:34:31.922
I christen thee "Club Waldo."

01:34:32.005 --> 01:34:35.217
Members only, no riffraff.

01:34:40.430 --> 01:34:42.266
Well, built to last.

01:35:02.953 --> 01:35:04.788
Didn't see that coming.

01:35:07.708 --> 01:35:09.688
I think I still have the receipt.
