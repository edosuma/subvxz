01:35.302 --> 01:36.137
Hey.

02:58.219 --> 03:02.806
SHOPLIFTERS

03:07.062 --> 03:08.605
Five croquettes, please.

03:08.812 --> 03:12.191
Five croquettes, sure.
That'll be 450 yen.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.528
- How much?
- 450 yen.

03:18.073 --> 03:19.407
A crusher...

03:20.532 --> 03:23.161
is shaped like a hammer.

03:24.788 --> 03:27.957
One blow with that thing
shatters any glass to bits.

03:28.832 --> 03:30.085
How much is it?

03:31.086 --> 03:32.254
About 2,000 yen.

03:34.004 --> 03:34.965
Expensive.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.718
- If you buy it.
- Here you go.

03:41.596 --> 03:42.597
Tasty.

03:44.598 --> 03:47.476
That store makes
the best croquettes.

03:48.770 --> 03:49.813
You're right.

03:52.106 --> 03:53.525
Man, it's cold.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.070
- What?
- I forgot shampoo.

03:58.112 --> 04:00.782
Let's get it the next time.
It's so cold.

04:05.453 --> 04:07.122
Feels like it's going to snow.

04:07.538 --> 04:08.581
Yeah.

04:19.718 --> 04:20.886
She's there again.

04:26.725 --> 04:27.766
Say...

04:30.019 --> 04:31.103
What's wrong?

04:33.814 --> 04:34.899
Where's your mommy?

04:36.192 --> 04:37.360
Hey, let's go.

04:37.651 --> 04:39.987
They'll get cold.

04:41.447 --> 04:42.698
But, she's...

04:44.951 --> 04:48.163
Say, want to eat a croquette?

04:50.206 --> 04:51.458
Want to eat a croquette?

04:59.882 --> 05:03.510
Can't you bring home
something to make us money?

05:04.637 --> 05:07.139
Your husband isn't good
at sniffing out profits.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.060
Shota, where's the shampoo?

05:10.476 --> 05:11.435
I forgot.

05:11.685 --> 05:12.937
Got a name?

05:15.357 --> 05:16.399
What?

05:17.942 --> 05:18.901
It's Yuri.

05:19.110 --> 05:20.946
How do you write Yuri?

05:21.487 --> 05:22.529
How old?

05:25.783 --> 05:26.825
Pre-school.

05:27.619 --> 05:29.537
- She's so frail.
- Your nail's flying.

05:29.788 --> 05:32.415
After you've fed her,
take her home.

05:32.624 --> 05:36.586
It's so cold out.
I'll take her home tomorrow.

05:36.795 --> 05:40.048
No, we're not a foster home.

05:40.257 --> 05:43.468
But look, we've got our very own
guardian angel here.

05:43.802 --> 05:45.387
Don't point your chopsticks.

05:45.595 --> 05:46.763
Ping!

05:49.682 --> 05:51.767
That's disgusting, Grandma!

05:51.976 --> 05:53.686
Your spit's flying everywhere.

05:54.187 --> 05:57.899
I told you not to throw your
nails in the entryway.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.651
Eat another one?

06:00.151 --> 06:03.153
You live off my pension
but you're so unreliable.

06:03.404 --> 06:04.446
Shut up.

06:07.658 --> 06:10.036
You're so skinny.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.288
Let's have a look at your arm.

06:13.456 --> 06:14.915
What happened here?

06:15.291 --> 06:16.458
I fell.

06:17.836 --> 06:18.879
Does it hurt?

06:20.838 --> 06:22.464
Let's have a better look at you.

06:25.759 --> 06:27.219
You're covered in scars.

06:35.144 --> 06:36.979
Take her home
before the cops get here.

06:37.187 --> 06:40.692
She's right, can't get involved.

06:42.151 --> 06:43.986
Grandma,
your noodles will get cold.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.661
- Straight?
- No, right, right.

06:52.161 --> 06:53.203
Here.

06:55.665 --> 06:56.833
Hey, hey.

06:57.334 --> 06:58.418
Is she asleep?

06:59.084 --> 07:02.004
She got a good deal.
She ate three croquettes.

07:03.464 --> 07:04.548
Ring the bell?

07:04.757 --> 07:07.927
No, no,
put her down by the door.

07:08.386 --> 07:10.472
She'll freeze to death.

07:11.096 --> 07:13.098
In that case...

07:14.642 --> 07:18.562
Put her down,
ring the bell and run?

07:18.812 --> 07:20.189
Like Santa Claus?

07:24.110 --> 07:27.322
That's what you always say!
You're never here!

07:29.115 --> 07:31.076
- I told you.
- I'm the one looking after her!

07:31.242 --> 07:32.493
I'll go take a look.

07:33.202 --> 07:34.703
You get her?

07:36.831 --> 07:40.001
Hell knows
who the real father is.

07:42.836 --> 07:44.964
- Don't!
- Shut up!

07:46.341 --> 07:48.259
That hurts! Why?

07:48.509 --> 07:51.346
I didn't want to
have her either!

07:52.430 --> 07:53.848
Now's our chance.

07:55.516 --> 07:56.560
Hey.

08:18.038 --> 08:18.998
It's cold.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.167
So cold.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.463
She wet the bed.

08:28.675 --> 08:29.800
Stinks.

08:35.764 --> 08:37.225
Say you're sorry.

08:37.433 --> 08:38.851
I'm sorry.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.061
I'm sorry.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.023
I'm sorry.

08:43.273 --> 08:45.191
That's enough.
Shhh, be quiet.

08:45.774 --> 08:47.818
We should have
taken her home last night.

08:48.068 --> 08:49.194
Maybe.

08:49.613 --> 08:51.907
Hey, those are mine.

08:52.115 --> 08:54.116
But they don't fit you anymore.

08:54.783 --> 08:56.952
- Where's my belt?
- OK, raise both arms.

08:59.331 --> 09:02.292
It's so cold today,
I should take the day off.

09:03.125 --> 09:05.086
Send an email saying
I caught a cold.

09:06.086 --> 09:07.338
Here's your belt.

09:12.427 --> 09:13.385
He's going out.

09:13.595 --> 09:16.431
I'm just pouring it now.

09:16.639 --> 09:17.890
Wait a minute.

09:18.642 --> 09:20.060
Oh, throw that out.

09:21.311 --> 09:22.812
Here you are, here.

09:26.942 --> 09:27.984
Ouch!

09:36.158 --> 09:37.201
Your nail, bad luck.

09:37.369 --> 09:38.536
Oh, my nail.

10:05.062 --> 10:06.146
It's all garbage.

10:09.359 --> 10:13.572
Another one ran away.

10:15.072 --> 10:16.574
It was Koga.

10:19.410 --> 10:22.329
No, he sent an email
saying, "I quit."

10:25.166 --> 10:26.877
He was useless anyway.

10:27.793 --> 10:29.587
When I see him,
I'll beat him up.

11:27.437 --> 11:28.812
Show me your arm.

11:35.570 --> 11:38.114
Many scars.

11:38.782 --> 11:41.993
The pain went away,
went away already.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.329
Now, the other side.

11:45.371 --> 11:46.455
Hello!

11:47.581 --> 11:49.833
I'm Yoneyama,
here to check up on you!

11:50.251 --> 11:51.293
Coming.

11:51.503 --> 11:52.629
Hatsue, are you there?

11:52.879 --> 11:54.505
Hey, this girl...

11:55.506 --> 11:56.465
Coming!

12:00.803 --> 12:01.762
Coming.

12:05.350 --> 12:07.686
Oh, hello there, I'm Yoneyama.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.653
The other side.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.404
This way? Sure.

12:24.369 --> 12:26.162
Hello, excuse me.

12:45.307 --> 12:47.225
Your neighbor Kaneko...

12:48.100 --> 12:51.104
finally moved into an apartment.

12:52.647 --> 12:55.317
Even though she had
three grown kids.

12:55.649 --> 13:00.029
So that's why I haven't seen her
around recently.

13:01.322 --> 13:04.617
Hatsue, you should talk things
over with your son.

13:06.076 --> 13:07.495
Does he live in Hakata?

13:07.745 --> 13:10.414
Did some real estate agent
send you here?

13:10.581 --> 13:11.875
No, no.

13:13.543 --> 13:15.754
I know how hard it is...

13:16.254 --> 13:18.632
for an old person to live alone.

13:20.466 --> 13:24.471
How much money are you making
to move me out of here?

13:27.974 --> 13:30.268
That's all in the past.

13:30.684 --> 13:32.394
I don't flip properties anymore.

14:04.385 --> 14:08.347
Only kids who can't study
at home go to school.

14:10.307 --> 14:17.231
YAMATOYA

14:29.910 --> 14:31.870
Hey, mister.

14:34.124 --> 14:35.375
I need a pack of cigarettes.

14:37.626 --> 14:40.170
- It's getting so cold.
- It's cold.

14:40.797 --> 14:41.923
I want Wakaba.

14:46.135 --> 14:47.469
320 yen.

15:19.961 --> 15:22.379
The baby doesn't look like
either of them.

15:23.173 --> 15:24.341
Plastic surgery?

15:25.008 --> 15:26.634
The father could be anyone.

15:26.884 --> 15:28.595
She used to be a call girl.

15:29.011 --> 15:30.304
But she's hiding it,

15:31.096 --> 15:34.558
- pretending she's lousy in bed.
- Amazing.

15:34.808 --> 15:36.937
This is for helping me out
this morning.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.774
You don't have to,
we help each other.

15:40.981 --> 15:43.192
- I'd like a drink, too.
- I'd like a hot lemon.

15:43.902 --> 15:45.487
I'm not treating you guys.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.199
What was it? A fever?

15:50.408 --> 15:53.870
Mumps, from the other kids
at pre-school.

15:59.042 --> 16:01.002
Do you have mumps, too?

16:01.211 --> 16:04.714
Hey, I don't have mumps.

16:05.923 --> 16:08.509
I'll catch it, too.

16:08.717 --> 16:09.677
Oh, no.

16:09.885 --> 16:11.929
- Hey, you already...
- Caught it?

16:12.054 --> 16:13.180
I caught it?

16:47.090 --> 16:48.675
I'm home.

16:55.181 --> 16:58.100
Hey, Shota.

17:16.868 --> 17:18.162
How did you get hurt?

17:19.497 --> 17:20.624
I fell.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.292
You got burned.

17:26.127 --> 17:27.588
Who did it to you?

17:30.342 --> 17:31.343
Your mom?

17:33.094 --> 17:34.554
My mom is nice.

17:34.971 --> 17:36.972
She buys me clothes, too.

17:39.142 --> 17:41.144
Then what were you
doing outside?

17:58.662 --> 17:59.788
What will you do?

18:01.373 --> 18:02.499
Go back to your home?

18:19.223 --> 18:20.641
I took the shampoo.

18:21.851 --> 18:23.353
Merit Shampoo.

18:23.979 --> 18:26.523
- Yamatoya only has Merit.
- Merit smells bad...

18:26.647 --> 18:28.857
Don't be so picky.

18:30.693 --> 18:34.572
Hey, it looks like
we kidnapped her.

18:35.281 --> 18:36.782
No, it doesn't.

18:37.491 --> 18:40.703
We're not confining her and we
haven't asked for a ransom.

18:41.078 --> 18:42.038
That's not the point.

18:42.247 --> 18:46.000
They haven't reported her
missing to the police?

18:47.501 --> 18:49.587
I bet they're relieved
she's gone.

18:51.213 --> 18:53.090
It's all Chinese cabbage.

18:54.092 --> 18:56.094
Chinese cabbage is good for you.

18:56.595 --> 18:58.430
It absorbs the meat broth.

18:59.597 --> 19:01.432
The gluten cake is cooked.

19:02.308 --> 19:03.643
What? Gluten cake?

19:05.353 --> 19:06.313
Look.

19:10.817 --> 19:11.984
You like gluten cake?

19:13.111 --> 19:14.321
Come over here.

19:22.828 --> 19:23.788
It's hot.

19:31.212 --> 19:32.379
Is that tasty?

19:34.465 --> 19:35.883
Have you eaten it before?

19:38.510 --> 19:39.471
With whom?

19:41.556 --> 19:42.641
Grandma.

19:46.560 --> 19:47.686
There's more.

19:48.605 --> 19:51.232
If you feed her too much,
she'll wet the bed again.

19:51.566 --> 19:54.818
She can sleep in my bed.

19:55.069 --> 19:56.820
No, I sleep with Grandma.

19:59.074 --> 20:00.366
This...

20:02.451 --> 20:03.327
What?

20:03.452 --> 20:04.913
Hold out your hand.

20:05.288 --> 20:06.248
Salt?

20:06.957 --> 20:10.418
This keeps you from
wetting the bed.

20:10.961 --> 20:13.380
Go ahead, lick it.

20:14.673 --> 20:16.007
It's salty.

20:16.799 --> 20:20.761
She licked it, licked it.
That's how we used to cure it.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.222
Sounds fishy to me.

20:23.682 --> 20:25.392
- I swear it's true.
- She's licking it.

20:30.313 --> 20:31.605
He's home.

20:37.820 --> 20:39.446
It's cold, Shota.

20:39.823 --> 20:41.740
- It's cold.
- It's cold.

20:42.491 --> 20:44.451
Hey, please close it.

20:44.702 --> 20:46.037
This is fine, here.

20:47.830 --> 20:49.248
He's hurt!

20:50.291 --> 20:51.292
On crutches!

20:51.500 --> 20:53.336
Is he drunk?

20:55.046 --> 20:56.631
I'm fine now.
I'm all good, no, no.

20:58.299 --> 21:01.051
Shota, you made such a mess.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.305
Make some tea.

21:03.512 --> 21:05.432
This room is fine.

21:05.640 --> 21:07.309
Her nail was a bad omen,

21:07.517 --> 21:10.644
but you forced me to go to work.

21:11.563 --> 21:15.108
What is this? You can't work
for about a month?

21:15.317 --> 21:17.359
Even day laborers get
workers' compensation, right?

21:17.568 --> 21:19.361
- Well, probably...
- Really?

21:19.570 --> 21:20.613
Really?

21:20.821 --> 21:22.948
So, it would be better
if you broke it,

21:23.115 --> 21:24.408
rather than cracked it?

21:24.659 --> 21:28.204
Stop joking around. I thought
I was going to die, ouch!

21:28.454 --> 21:30.039
You get compensation?

21:34.211 --> 21:35.211
Oh, thank you.

21:36.880 --> 21:37.964
She's cute.

21:38.173 --> 21:39.798
- Grandma?
- The other one.

21:40.090 --> 21:42.176
- My wife's sister.
- Different mothers.

21:43.761 --> 21:45.137
So, you have a family.

21:45.763 --> 21:47.431
I thought you were single.

21:47.682 --> 21:48.933
I hear that a lot.

22:10.747 --> 22:12.289
I'll teach you how, someday.

22:20.464 --> 22:22.384
This is your favorite,
gluten cake.

22:26.637 --> 22:28.013
Was your grandma nice?

22:32.560 --> 22:33.644
Did you live with her?

22:36.272 --> 22:37.940
Now she's in heaven.

22:42.695 --> 22:45.155
Then forget about her.

22:51.871 --> 22:53.290
Sorry to keep you waiting.

22:53.999 --> 22:55.165
Thank you so much.

22:58.252 --> 23:01.505
Enter your code now.

23:02.214 --> 23:05.467
1192, everybody knows
the year of the Kamakura regime.

23:06.678 --> 23:08.138
Just say it in your head.

23:08.512 --> 23:09.805
I am.

23:10.015 --> 23:12.642
No, you're not.
No one else should find out.

23:19.231 --> 23:21.317
What does MVK stand for?

23:21.526 --> 23:22.986
Male virgin killer.

23:23.694 --> 23:25.070
What exactly do you do?

23:25.529 --> 23:26.780
Well...

23:27.490 --> 23:31.577
You wear a knit dress that
shows your sideboob a little.

23:35.498 --> 23:36.790
Sideboob.

23:37.166 --> 23:39.168
That's what's popular now?

23:40.420 --> 23:44.925
It's 3,000 yen. The shop
and the girl split it 50-50.

23:46.509 --> 23:49.679
How great you can get paid
just for that.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.139
You're getting paid, too.

23:52.973 --> 23:55.684
I get paid for damages.

23:56.728 --> 23:58.188
- Damages?
- Right.

23:59.189 --> 24:00.148
Your pension is?

24:01.857 --> 24:04.277
Right, my pension.

24:05.319 --> 24:06.570
I guess, in a way.

24:11.284 --> 24:12.451
Mr. Four?

24:12.661 --> 24:13.953
- Yeah.
- Yours.

24:14.162 --> 24:15.247
I should go.

24:16.288 --> 24:17.624
Was that your rice cake?

24:18.708 --> 24:21.753
Why do you use Sayaka,
your sister's name?

24:22.420 --> 24:23.755
What do you mean, why?

24:26.090 --> 24:27.800
You're so mean.

24:30.386 --> 24:31.637
Just like who?

24:33.890 --> 24:35.392
Oh, good, good.

24:35.683 --> 24:38.936
That's good timing.
Try it again, good.

24:44.733 --> 24:48.279
That's right You've gotten
really good.

24:50.073 --> 24:52.909
Yuri,
you're getting the hang of it.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.165
You're late going to work today.

25:00.584 --> 25:02.168
It's work-share today.

25:03.086 --> 25:04.086
What is that?

25:04.753 --> 25:08.340
They can't pay us all,
so ten of us start at noon.

25:11.094 --> 25:14.514
So, everybody gets
a little poorer.

25:14.931 --> 25:16.516
Something like that.

25:16.682 --> 25:18.225
I'm not finished yet.

25:26.026 --> 25:29.988
But no workers' compensation
is a real drag.

25:31.364 --> 25:34.366
A real drag. What a waste,
being so nice to you.

25:37.077 --> 25:39.038
Do you think that guy was OK?

25:41.540 --> 25:43.125
He doesn't care about us.

25:44.294 --> 25:46.630
He sure was good looking.

25:46.837 --> 25:49.173
Hey, what's this?

25:51.384 --> 25:53.595
A tie pin.

25:55.387 --> 25:56.388
It's yours.

25:57.307 --> 25:58.516
But it's fake.

26:08.234 --> 26:09.485
Is he full-time?

26:10.653 --> 26:11.654
Yeah.

26:13.781 --> 26:15.282
So lucky to be full-time.

26:15.407 --> 26:16.367
Want it?

26:16.617 --> 26:17.618
Yes.

26:18.662 --> 26:19.871
You can't have it.

26:23.500 --> 26:26.211
Granny's pension is 70,000 yen
a month, right?

26:28.212 --> 26:29.380
60,000 yen.

26:30.839 --> 26:31.966
But lucky her,

26:32.092 --> 26:34.344
she gets that 'til she dies,
because of her husband.

26:34.803 --> 26:39.224
She talks big, like she's
actually earning that money.

26:40.224 --> 26:41.600
We take care of her.

26:46.522 --> 26:48.148
It's so damn cold.

26:49.025 --> 26:50.026
Welcome home.

26:50.151 --> 26:51.236
I'm home.

26:52.112 --> 26:53.196
Welcome home, Grandma.

26:53.320 --> 26:56.323
The pond at the shrine was
frozen over.

26:56.532 --> 26:59.702
We can't have you slipping
and breaking your hip.

26:59.911 --> 27:01.203
Where's Aki?

27:01.413 --> 27:03.707
She went to go
shake her breasts.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.500
- What's this?
- Sweet bean jelly.

27:11.006 --> 27:12.298
You're heading out?

27:13.383 --> 27:16.052
Hey, it's cold, you should
wear another layer.

27:16.595 --> 27:18.680
Look after Yuri, Grandma.

27:18.971 --> 27:19.931
Yes, yes.

27:21.057 --> 27:24.477
Go ahead and fix up
whatever there is to eat.

27:28.647 --> 27:29.815
Until the morning?

27:30.066 --> 27:33.068
- I was up hostessing all night.
- Go to sleep.

27:33.278 --> 27:35.404
- Ayu.
- Yes.

27:35.529 --> 27:37.824
You're booked
for the chat room at 3:30.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.451
Yay!

27:42.244 --> 27:44.747
- You're raking it in.
- I have to save money.

27:44.914 --> 27:46.415
- Sayaka.
- Yes.

27:47.250 --> 27:50.295
A customer complained
you wear double panties.

27:50.461 --> 27:52.504
Take one off.

27:52.923 --> 27:54.382
You think you're
too good for this.

27:54.548 --> 27:55.674
No, I just get cold.

27:55.799 --> 27:57.344
- Harumi.
- Me?

27:57.760 --> 28:00.221
No fingers in underwear here,
so watch it.

28:00.387 --> 28:02.014
You could shut us all down.

28:02.140 --> 28:04.142
- Right.
- Thanks.

28:04.768 --> 28:06.644
You take this too seriously.

28:06.853 --> 28:08.313
Shut up.

28:17.821 --> 28:19.949
- You're up, Sayaka.
- Right.

28:28.833 --> 28:30.000
Hello.

28:31.294 --> 28:33.004
Is today your day off?

28:43.222 --> 28:44.974
I DIDN'T GO TO WORK TODAY.

28:45.182 --> 28:47.434
I played hooky today, too.

28:51.105 --> 28:55.192
Mr. Four, you're a breast man,
not a butt man, right?

29:06.037 --> 29:07.538
BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE.

29:07.663 --> 29:08.623
OK.

29:09.708 --> 29:12.043
I'll start now.

30:01.092 --> 30:02.969
- Break time.
- Right.

30:12.686 --> 30:13.812
Excuse me.

30:15.856 --> 30:18.902
I'd like to catch a sea bass.

30:19.277 --> 30:22.239
What's the difference between
a plug and a pencil popper?

30:22.489 --> 30:24.658
I'll show you
the pencil poppers.

30:26.576 --> 30:27.786
There are so many,
it's confusing.

30:27.911 --> 30:28.953
Happy to help.

30:29.621 --> 30:32.749
A plug is the generic name
for plastic fishing lures.

31:08.492 --> 31:10.662
That worked out great, right?

31:11.913 --> 31:13.664
Yuri, you did a great job, too!

31:14.415 --> 31:15.500
Yay!

31:17.544 --> 31:18.753
In those situations,

31:19.587 --> 31:24.634
the trick is not to panic and
wait for a clerk to go on break.

31:25.926 --> 31:27.303
We don't need her help.

31:29.055 --> 31:32.267
This is what you
call work-share.

31:32.808 --> 31:33.976
What's that?

31:35.729 --> 31:38.189
It means what it sounds like,

31:38.898 --> 31:40.482
we all share the work.

31:41.442 --> 31:42.693
She's in the way.

31:43.028 --> 31:45.279
Don't say that,
she's your sister.

31:45.614 --> 31:46.948
She's not my sister.

31:47.656 --> 31:50.826
She's your sister.
Yuri is your sister!

31:56.499 --> 31:58.500
You're his sister, right?

32:01.630 --> 32:02.756
It's no big deal.

32:07.469 --> 32:09.221
He doesn't mean it.

32:10.387 --> 32:11.847
He's just rebelling now.

32:17.979 --> 32:19.689
How much can you get for those?

32:21.066 --> 32:22.983
About 40,000 to 50,000 yen.

32:25.069 --> 32:29.490
With these, I won't have
to work anymore this month.

32:29.782 --> 32:31.992
Hey Aki,

32:32.535 --> 32:35.622
you should contribute, too.
You're making money, right?

32:35.747 --> 32:39.834
She doesn't have to.
That's the deal we made, right?

32:40.794 --> 32:43.838
She gets her big ideas
because you always spoil her.

32:44.631 --> 32:46.383
You're the one
with the big ideas.

32:46.508 --> 32:48.218
You're preying on her pension.

32:48.468 --> 32:50.387
"Preying" is not a nice word.

32:50.886 --> 32:52.972
Try preying on me if you can.

32:53.765 --> 32:55.267
No one can prey on her.

32:55.849 --> 32:59.144
Oh, I got myself
an insurance plan.

33:00.355 --> 33:04.358
Because I don't want
a lonely death.

33:05.859 --> 33:09.697
What do you call
that kind of insurance?

33:13.201 --> 33:16.413
- You're so warm, Grandma.
- Watch out.

33:16.621 --> 33:18.999
I'm mending with a needle,
watch out.

33:19.164 --> 33:20.541
Whose clothes?

33:20.750 --> 33:22.626
That girl, the little girl's.

33:27.464 --> 33:30.259
Did something bad happen?

33:31.344 --> 33:32.345
Why?

33:32.721 --> 33:35.015
Your feet are colder than usual.

33:36.516 --> 33:38.810
You know everything,
don't you, Grandma?

33:39.769 --> 33:42.564
You're lucky to have
such a pretty nose.

33:42.730 --> 33:45.442
You think so?
I don't like it very much.

33:46.651 --> 33:48.028
Don't stare at me.

33:51.573 --> 33:53.783
Yuri! Lick salt
before you go to bed!

33:54.326 --> 33:55.535
She's right there.

33:56.243 --> 33:57.578
What? Why?

34:00.080 --> 34:02.208
What's going on? You must be
cold, sitting out here.

34:05.211 --> 34:06.462
Will he come home?

34:09.465 --> 34:11.134
You're worried about Shota?

34:19.726 --> 34:21.311
It's not your fault, Yuri.

34:30.987 --> 34:35.367
How about the name "No lonely
death" for the insurance plan?

34:42.039 --> 34:44.750
Even though she's being
abused by her parents...

34:47.170 --> 34:48.588
You mean Yuri?

34:49.880 --> 34:53.551
She should be more worried about
her own troubles.

34:54.594 --> 34:57.681
With a mother who wishes
she hadn't given birth to you,

35:00.099 --> 35:01.934
usually,
you'd turn out more like us.

35:06.815 --> 35:07.816
You're right.

35:10.360 --> 35:13.070
You don't grow up
to care about others.

35:15.155 --> 35:17.116
You're right.

35:31.672 --> 35:32.798
Here you are.

35:38.889 --> 35:39.972
I figured.

35:42.601 --> 35:43.434
Ouch.

35:44.059 --> 35:45.103
It's so cold.

35:47.230 --> 35:49.106
Yuri's so worried,

35:49.231 --> 35:51.942
she's been waiting for you
by the door the whole time.

35:54.528 --> 35:56.405
You don't like Yuri?

35:58.282 --> 35:59.534
So, what's wrong?

36:01.744 --> 36:03.621
It's more fun with just us guys.

36:04.204 --> 36:05.706
Of course, it is.

36:07.208 --> 36:08.292
But for Yuri,

36:08.418 --> 36:10.211
if she helps us out,

36:11.213 --> 36:13.006
it's easier to live with us.

36:14.798 --> 36:15.925
Right?

36:18.802 --> 36:19.721
Got it?

36:20.347 --> 36:21.389
Got it.

36:23.266 --> 36:25.684
Yuri is your what?

36:28.313 --> 36:29.314
My sister.

36:29.481 --> 36:31.691
That's right, right, right.

36:31.942 --> 36:33.985
In that case, what am I?

36:34.360 --> 36:35.694
I'm your...

36:37.322 --> 36:40.157
Da...

36:40.367 --> 36:42.160
- It's OK.
- Say it, c'mon.

36:42.284 --> 36:44.370
Just try saying it, once.
Go ahead.

36:44.579 --> 36:46.331
I will, someday.

36:46.539 --> 36:48.458
Shoot, not fair.

36:49.208 --> 36:50.626
Oh well.

36:51.753 --> 36:53.505
OK. Someday, then.

36:58.134 --> 37:00.010
Let's go home, it's cold.

37:13.525 --> 37:16.068
Hey, did you
sell the fishing rods?

37:17.570 --> 37:18.904
They are still there.

37:19.447 --> 37:20.699
OK, then.

37:21.865 --> 37:23.742
What, you want to fish?

37:28.206 --> 37:31.166
Do you know what Swimmy is?

37:34.753 --> 37:38.507
Your dad can't speak English.

37:40.302 --> 37:43.387
It's not English.
It's in the Japanese textbook.

37:46.224 --> 37:49.227
Your dad's Japanese
is even worse.

37:50.603 --> 37:54.148
Swimmy is a story about
a bunch of little fish,

37:54.900 --> 37:58.193
that beat up a great big tuna.

37:58.695 --> 38:00.155
Do you know why?

38:00.530 --> 38:01.489
Why?

38:03.490 --> 38:06.452
Must be because
tuna tastes good, right?

38:06.786 --> 38:07.913
I don't think so.

38:08.996 --> 38:11.290
We haven't eaten
any tuna recently.

38:36.440 --> 38:38.651
I'm going to eat you all up!

38:57.753 --> 38:59.422
- Hey, hey.
- What?

39:00.422 --> 39:02.800
Did you know
there used to be a pond here?

39:03.635 --> 39:04.678
Yeah.

39:05.302 --> 39:07.888
Apparently, Grandpa used to
keep carp in it.

39:09.266 --> 39:11.476
You couldn't keep carp
in a place like this.

39:12.143 --> 39:14.061
I'm sure that's one of
Grandma's tall tales.

39:15.438 --> 39:19.568
The last time Juri was seen
was February 8th.

39:20.318 --> 39:25.657
A neighbor remembers seeing her
playing alone outside her home.

39:26.115 --> 39:29.661
She has been missing for over
two months, but her parents

39:30.036 --> 39:32.871
never filed a missing persons
report with the police.

39:32.998 --> 39:35.416
Was it really Yuri?

39:40.255 --> 39:43.215
What are you smelling me for.

39:43.425 --> 39:44.384
Hey, don't.

39:45.719 --> 39:47.846
Hey, Yuri's on TV.

39:56.021 --> 39:57.856
She was reported missing when

39:58.023 --> 40:00.525
Child Welfare Service
contacted the police.

40:01.775 --> 40:05.279
Why did her parents
tell lie after lie?

40:05.655 --> 40:07.615
Why did they
hide her disappearance

40:07.782 --> 40:08.950
for over two months?

40:09.701 --> 40:11.411
The police are
questioning them

40:11.619 --> 40:12.871
as important
material witnesses.

40:13.121 --> 40:16.541
The cops think her parents
killed her.

40:19.460 --> 40:23.005
What? So, her name is Juri,
not Yuri.

40:26.592 --> 40:28.052
This looks bad. Really bad.

40:28.302 --> 40:30.346
It's too late for that now.

40:32.641 --> 40:34.726
Hey, Yuri, listen.

40:37.228 --> 40:39.772
Can you find your way home
by yourself?

40:41.148 --> 40:43.902
She can't do that,
it's too late.

40:44.152 --> 40:45.362
What will you do?

40:46.655 --> 40:48.073
Try going home?

40:49.490 --> 40:51.076
You'll stay here, right?

40:59.501 --> 41:02.504
How about Hana? I had
wanted to name a girl that.

41:02.753 --> 41:04.213
Hana?

41:04.713 --> 41:06.465
She doesn't look like a Hana.

41:09.302 --> 41:10.512
Let's see.

41:11.596 --> 41:12.931
Lin?

41:13.181 --> 41:15.099
- Do you write it like a bell?
- No.

41:15.266 --> 41:17.810
You know, that other way.

41:25.277 --> 41:26.570
It's short.

41:27.320 --> 41:28.405
All done!

41:28.862 --> 41:30.447
You look cute!

41:31.282 --> 41:33.617
- It's a good disguise.
- You look so cute.

41:33.827 --> 41:35.245
Want to see a mirror?

41:35.954 --> 41:37.289
Looking good.

41:37.664 --> 41:39.040
A real beauty.

41:39.583 --> 41:40.750
Looks good.

41:44.795 --> 41:46.130
Short, isn't it?

41:47.382 --> 41:48.465
What do you think?

41:51.052 --> 41:52.762
- It's cute.
- It's cute.

41:53.597 --> 41:54.639
You're cute.

41:55.931 --> 41:58.267
Your hair's naturally brown.

41:59.393 --> 42:01.270
I'm jealous of your hair.

42:04.733 --> 42:05.817
Say...

42:08.903 --> 42:13.365
I have another name, too.

42:15.034 --> 42:16.118
What is it?

42:17.871 --> 42:18.997
Sayaka.

42:24.835 --> 42:26.253
I like Lin better.

42:31.425 --> 42:32.760
I like Lin better, too.

42:35.012 --> 42:36.096
I'm Lin.

42:38.224 --> 42:39.601
Hello, I'm Lin.

42:40.936 --> 42:42.019
Like this.

42:59.536 --> 43:01.664
The man saved you, right?

43:05.126 --> 43:07.211
Do you like Auntie and Grandma?

43:10.632 --> 43:12.634
So, you can stand it?

43:14.010 --> 43:15.136
I can.

43:18.264 --> 43:21.643
I was sure
she'd want to go home.

43:23.436 --> 43:26.606
Do you think she... chose us?

43:27.273 --> 43:29.608
Usually, you can't choose
your own parents.

43:30.277 --> 43:33.989
But then, maybe it's stronger
when you choose them yourself.

43:34.114 --> 43:35.072
What is?

43:35.282 --> 43:36.575
What is...

43:38.284 --> 43:39.493
The bond.

43:40.661 --> 43:41.745
The bond.

43:42.581 --> 43:46.710
I chose you, too.

43:56.510 --> 43:58.429
- Amazing.
- Right?

44:01.266 --> 44:02.434
- Do that again.
- Again?

44:31.795 --> 44:33.964
Shota!

44:36.134 --> 44:39.054
You're so cool, Dad!

44:39.804 --> 44:40.972
Are you a kid?

44:42.514 --> 44:43.599
Shut up.

44:45.893 --> 44:46.852
Tell me.

44:48.813 --> 44:49.940
What?

44:51.273 --> 44:53.067
When do you and Nobuyo...

44:54.902 --> 44:56.153
do it?

45:00.574 --> 45:03.577
We don't need that anymore.

45:06.289 --> 45:07.415
Is that true?

45:11.001 --> 45:12.086
We're...

45:13.672 --> 45:16.632
connected in our hearts,
not down here.

45:16.840 --> 45:18.551
Cut it out.

45:19.594 --> 45:20.637
Sounds fishy.

45:23.097 --> 45:25.224
How do you think
we're connected?

45:32.398 --> 45:33.525
Money.

45:34.693 --> 45:35.819
Normally.

45:38.989 --> 45:40.865
But we're not normal.

45:48.123 --> 45:49.541
You're so cool, Dad!

45:52.793 --> 45:54.253
Just a normal one is fine.

45:58.173 --> 46:00.634
Say, Lin, have you ever been
to a beach?

46:03.262 --> 46:04.597
How about you?

46:05.056 --> 46:07.641
What? Sure, I think so.

46:08.226 --> 46:09.811
You think so.

46:14.106 --> 46:15.442
Coming in.

46:16.985 --> 46:18.737
She looks so cute.

46:18.987 --> 46:20.363
What's this?

46:21.072 --> 46:22.949
Your bag won't fit all that.

46:23.742 --> 46:26.952
Then just wear it out.

46:27.161 --> 46:29.747
Just wear it out.

46:31.916 --> 46:33.210
Which looks better?

46:33.960 --> 46:35.586
She looks so good in yellow.

46:35.836 --> 46:38.255
Her hair is brown.

46:39.673 --> 46:41.050
We'll get this one, then.

46:41.259 --> 46:42.427
Great, great.

46:44.471 --> 46:45.554
You don't want it?

46:47.014 --> 46:48.016
Why not?

46:48.432 --> 46:49.809
Won't hit me?

46:51.518 --> 46:53.187
You won't hit me later?

47:01.153 --> 47:02.739
I'm not going to hit you.

47:04.782 --> 47:09.578
Three, four, knock at the door

47:10.496 --> 47:15.417
Five, six, pick up sticks

47:16.168 --> 47:17.295
Time to get out?

47:36.021 --> 47:37.273
What's that?

47:38.650 --> 47:39.651
An octopus.

47:42.487 --> 47:44.072
I'm going to catch fish.

47:44.864 --> 47:45.990
Catch a fish?

47:47.367 --> 47:48.535
It looks so real.

47:54.039 --> 47:55.666
What happened to you there?

47:57.460 --> 48:01.798
This?
I got burned with a hot iron.

48:05.010 --> 48:06.261
Me, too.

48:11.224 --> 48:12.350
We're the same.

48:21.275 --> 48:23.819
It's OK. It's all better.

48:29.034 --> 48:31.744
OK, OK. Thank you.

48:35.956 --> 48:40.377
"He taught them
to swim close together,

48:40.628 --> 48:42.797
each in his own place,

48:43.380 --> 48:48.802
and when they had learned to
swim like one giant fish,

48:49.387 --> 48:50.722
he said, 'I'll be the eye.'

48:50.847 --> 48:53.642
And so they swam
in the cool morning water,

48:53.849 --> 48:58.020
and joining together
in the midday sun,

48:58.230 --> 49:02.067
they chased the big fish away".

49:03.275 --> 49:05.486
Yay! Great job.

49:06.278 --> 49:08.907
But don't you feel sorry
for the big fish?

49:09.324 --> 49:12.117
That's not true, after all,
he ate all your friends, right?

49:12.327 --> 49:13.745
That's true, but...

49:34.557 --> 49:35.891
Come, sit here.

49:50.949 --> 49:52.032
Let's burn it.

49:53.909 --> 49:54.952
OK?

50:13.804 --> 50:15.514
The reason they hit you...

50:17.726 --> 50:19.728
isn't because you are bad.

50:23.898 --> 50:26.483
If they say they hit you
because they love you,

50:27.485 --> 50:28.612
that is a lie.

50:30.864 --> 50:32.115
If they loved you,

50:33.867 --> 50:35.410
if they really loved you,

50:37.579 --> 50:38.997
this is what you do.

50:48.505 --> 50:49.673
This is what you do.

51:27.878 --> 51:29.713
There's really a bug.

51:32.217 --> 51:33.677
Look, a boat.

51:36.012 --> 51:37.138
Hey!

51:54.239 --> 51:55.490
Brother!

51:55.907 --> 51:56.992
Yes.

51:58.702 --> 51:59.703
What is it?

52:05.250 --> 52:06.251
A cicada.

52:06.668 --> 52:07.626
Where?

52:07.835 --> 52:10.129
It hasn't grown up
and come out of its shell yet.

52:14.175 --> 52:15.969
A caterpillar, don't get itchy.

52:16.094 --> 52:17.177
It touched.

52:21.932 --> 52:26.771
Go for it, go for it, go for it!

53:02.056 --> 53:03.098
Hey!

53:16.112 --> 53:17.239
I'll give you these.

53:23.494 --> 53:25.204
Don't make your sister do it.

53:47.601 --> 53:49.311
Are you firing one of us?

53:50.855 --> 53:52.356
Why is it between us?

53:53.942 --> 53:56.860
Well, we're in a real bind too.

53:58.195 --> 54:00.239
If we have to cut back,

54:00.739 --> 54:04.618
it has to be one of you
with the higher hourly wages.

54:07.871 --> 54:11.500
Can the two of you
please talk it over?

54:23.054 --> 54:24.764
Why does it have to be me?

54:25.389 --> 54:26.932
I said, I'm asking you.

54:27.559 --> 54:30.644
But that's not...
We're both hard up,

54:30.769 --> 54:32.980
it's not just you, you know.

54:34.690 --> 54:36.108
If you let me stay,

54:36.943 --> 54:38.153
I'll keep quiet.

54:39.695 --> 54:41.655
You were stealing stuff, too.

54:42.574 --> 54:43.617
Not about that.

54:45.702 --> 54:46.828
The news...

54:48.871 --> 54:50.248
I saw you...

54:51.166 --> 54:53.793
when you were
with that little girl.

55:09.226 --> 55:10.184
OK.

55:14.063 --> 55:15.898
But if you talk,
I will kill you.

55:35.793 --> 55:39.922
How is father's former wife
related to you now?

55:41.048 --> 55:43.802
I know, but I can't help it.

55:44.260 --> 55:45.594
But she keeps visiting.

55:45.762 --> 55:47.681
Don't mind me.

55:48.389 --> 55:51.893
I just stopped by
to honor his memory.

55:52.226 --> 55:53.478
- Yes.
- Yes.

56:01.443 --> 56:03.112
Is everyone doing well?

56:04.614 --> 56:06.699
I haven't seen them
since my father's funeral.

56:09.494 --> 56:12.079
You can't fight blood.

56:12.246 --> 56:14.373
This area is...

56:25.467 --> 56:26.427
Welcome.

56:26.594 --> 56:27.511
I'm off.

56:27.637 --> 56:29.222
Sayaka, dinner tonight?

56:29.514 --> 56:31.099
- What?
- Cabbage rolls tonight.

56:31.224 --> 56:33.643
Yay, I'm in. But with tomato,
not white sauce.

56:33.893 --> 56:35.102
Off you go.

56:35.603 --> 56:37.897
- Save me my slice of cake.
- The Mont Blanc.

56:38.023 --> 56:39.774
- I'm off.
- Off you go.

56:39.983 --> 56:42.611
She's so grown up.

56:42.860 --> 56:43.819
Yes.

56:44.695 --> 56:46.572
She's a sophomore.

56:49.826 --> 56:51.702
And your older daughter?

56:55.039 --> 56:56.166
You mean, Aki?

56:56.750 --> 56:57.918
Yes.

56:58.168 --> 56:59.501
She's abroad, right?

57:00.878 --> 57:04.715
Yes, she seems to be
enjoying Australia.

57:06.217 --> 57:07.176
Right?

57:07.469 --> 57:10.347
She didn't come home
for summer vacation,

57:10.512 --> 57:12.473
which made her father sad.

57:13.057 --> 57:16.769
Oh, I see, that's wonderful.

57:22.233 --> 57:23.067
Here.

57:24.402 --> 57:25.653
It's not very much, but...

57:26.445 --> 57:28.614
Oh, I see.

57:29.282 --> 57:30.784
Well, in that case, thanks.

57:30.992 --> 57:34.663
I'm very sorry about what
happened with my mother.

57:35.204 --> 57:39.708
Well, it's hardly your fault.

57:54.682 --> 57:56.476
Shoot, only 30,000 yen again.

58:06.735 --> 58:08.279
Thank you so much.

58:10.782 --> 58:12.617
I hope you enjoyed it.

58:16.454 --> 58:17.539
Mr. Four,

58:19.373 --> 58:21.834
let's go to the chat room.

58:24.461 --> 58:26.297
I'd like to see your face, too,

58:27.340 --> 58:28.633
Mr. Four.

58:38.726 --> 58:40.019
Great.

58:42.731 --> 58:44.190
What shall we do?

58:45.650 --> 58:46.693
Cuddle?

58:47.652 --> 58:49.862
Hug? Sleep on my lap?

58:54.742 --> 58:56.244
My little sister...

58:57.202 --> 59:01.081
Her mother bought her
a bathing suit,

59:01.541 --> 59:03.793
and she just loves it.

59:04.126 --> 59:08.172
She wears it around the house,
even when she takes a bath.

59:09.298 --> 59:12.885
And it just reminds me
how I used to do that.

59:13.677 --> 59:16.096
I used to do
the exact same thing.

59:20.059 --> 59:22.770
It's OK to talk to me,
in this room.

59:25.148 --> 59:26.274
I mean...

59:35.074 --> 59:36.408
What happened here?

59:44.458 --> 59:45.793
You hit someone?

59:48.713 --> 59:49.714
Who?

59:54.635 --> 59:55.804
I've...

59:59.224 --> 01:00:00.976
hit myself, too.

01:00:03.561 --> 01:00:06.815
It hurts, doesn't it?

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:10.568
It hurts, right?

01:00:20.036 --> 01:00:21.329
It's all right.

01:00:46.771 --> 01:00:48.148
It's warm together.

01:01:03.579 --> 01:01:04.706
Does it hurt?

01:01:05.414 --> 01:01:06.541
Yeah.

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.546
I can feel it's going to rain.

01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:14.382
Your leg comes in handy.

01:01:23.099 --> 01:01:25.434
Cold noodles
hit the spot in summer.

01:01:25.809 --> 01:01:26.894
Yup.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.336
Why'd you put makeup on?

01:01:55.090 --> 01:01:58.425
The department store clerk
recommended it.

01:02:03.681 --> 01:02:04.682
This, too.

01:02:09.938 --> 01:02:11.273
Hey, how did you afford it?

01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:13.275
I just got fired.

01:02:15.193 --> 01:02:16.444
They found you out?

01:02:16.777 --> 01:02:19.697
Something like that.

01:02:23.492 --> 01:02:27.038
We could open
another bar, together.

01:02:27.371 --> 01:02:28.831
Way downtown.

01:02:29.748 --> 01:02:32.167
If we hire Aki,
we might do well.

01:02:32.293 --> 01:02:35.170
No, you're still
looking good, you.

01:02:35.338 --> 01:02:39.009
If you wear makeup,
like in the old days.

01:02:41.010 --> 01:02:44.471
Here comes the rain, see?

01:02:55.858 --> 01:02:59.737
I'm just so tired.

01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:13.335
You got this too?

01:03:15.586 --> 01:03:16.838
You can tell?

01:03:18.882 --> 01:03:21.967
1,980 yen.
Looks more expensive, right?

01:03:23.929 --> 01:03:24.971
It looks great.

01:04:08.306 --> 01:04:11.226
Hey, hey what, what...

01:04:11.893 --> 01:04:13.269
Oh, oh.

01:04:21.443 --> 01:04:22.445
Oh, oh.

01:04:30.244 --> 01:04:33.581
I can't run any more.

01:04:38.003 --> 01:04:40.755
Does this mean
thunder is coming?

01:04:43.173 --> 01:04:44.134
Hurry!

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.594
There'll be thunder, right?

01:05:05.697 --> 01:05:08.074
What are you acting cool for?

01:05:10.534 --> 01:05:11.786
I did it.

01:05:14.371 --> 01:05:16.290
Hey, I did it, right?

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.293
Yeah, well.

01:05:22.005 --> 01:05:24.965
What's with you, looking like
you're not totally satisfied.

01:05:25.759 --> 01:05:27.885
I hardly broke a sweat.

01:05:28.177 --> 01:05:29.721
You're a liar, you.

01:05:29.887 --> 01:05:30.971
Gimme.

01:05:45.402 --> 01:05:46.362
Another round?

01:05:46.570 --> 01:05:49.782
No, hey,
how old do you think I am?

01:05:50.824 --> 01:05:53.327
Let me bask in the afterglow
a little longer.

01:05:53.869 --> 01:05:57.039
Your afterglow is a lot longer.
You're soaked in sweat.

01:06:01.753 --> 01:06:03.296
I did it, right?

01:06:11.387 --> 01:06:15.683
Hey, look, you've got leeks
on your back.

01:06:15.849 --> 01:06:16.893
What?

01:06:18.103 --> 01:06:19.186
Where?

01:06:20.896 --> 01:06:23.190
Where? What?

01:06:25.485 --> 01:06:29.280
Don't, stop, that tickles.

01:06:34.952 --> 01:06:38.081
Tastes salty, the leek.

01:06:45.255 --> 01:06:47.215
Oh, they're back.
They're home, home!

01:06:49.259 --> 01:06:50.510
We're home!

01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:53.889
Oh, you got caught in the rain!

01:06:54.806 --> 01:06:56.557
We found a cicada grub.

01:06:56.766 --> 01:06:58.393
What, a cicada, OK.

01:06:58.643 --> 01:07:00.519
I'm soaked.

01:07:00.728 --> 01:07:02.230
It just started pouring.

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:05.400
That's right, pouring rain.
All right, OK.

01:07:05.983 --> 01:07:07.235
Pouring rain!

01:07:07.485 --> 01:07:09.195
What were you doing?

01:07:09.445 --> 01:07:11.572
Look, it's raining, raining.

01:07:11.947 --> 01:07:13.115
It poured.

01:07:13.490 --> 01:07:16.911
Take your cicada and
go take a bath, a bath, go!

01:07:18.454 --> 01:07:21.958
Make a hole in the center,
and let's...

01:07:22.291 --> 01:07:25.211
put it in there, young lady.

01:07:25.461 --> 01:07:29.215
Here goes, yes, watch carefully.

01:07:31.425 --> 01:07:33.260
How many kids?

01:07:33.802 --> 01:07:34.929
- Three.
- Three?

01:07:35.137 --> 01:07:38.724
The daughter-in-law
sweet talked her son,

01:07:39.266 --> 01:07:41.101
and they moved out.

01:07:42.519 --> 01:07:45.231
Oh, yeah. That happens a lot.

01:07:45.481 --> 01:07:46.775
I'm home.

01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:48.568
Welcome home.

01:07:49.610 --> 01:07:52.239
- Did you get rained on?
- I was fine.

01:07:55.367 --> 01:07:57.452
- What?
- Did something good happen?

01:07:59.286 --> 01:08:01.538
I'll tell you soon, Grandma.

01:08:01.789 --> 01:08:03.041
I see.

01:08:03.166 --> 01:08:04.543
I see, she says.

01:08:04.708 --> 01:08:06.085
Was it a guy?

01:08:06.795 --> 01:08:07.878
That's right!

01:08:08.713 --> 01:08:10.131
What kind of guy?

01:08:10.297 --> 01:08:13.050
Just a regular customer
where I work.

01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:15.262
- What?
- He was a customer.

01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:19.807
So, we're the same.

01:08:20.182 --> 01:08:21.810
Even if that's the same...

01:08:22.185 --> 01:08:24.229
But it's important.

01:08:24.729 --> 01:08:25.814
What?

01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:27.064
Is he handsome?

01:08:28.314 --> 01:08:29.733
Yeah, you could say so.

01:08:29.899 --> 01:08:31.027
That's different.

01:08:31.528 --> 01:08:32.612
It's different.

01:08:33.069 --> 01:08:34.447
So, what's he like?

01:08:35.657 --> 01:08:36.658
The quiet type.

01:08:36.865 --> 01:08:40.118
The quiet type is good,
the quiet types are...

01:08:40.328 --> 01:08:44.457
Talkative men are no good,
talkative men are bad!

01:08:44.582 --> 01:08:45.916
You calling me?

01:08:46.126 --> 01:08:48.002
- Not calling you!
- Not calling you!

01:08:49.377 --> 01:08:51.087
Here goes, here goes!

01:08:51.381 --> 01:08:52.631
Here goes, blow!

01:08:53.925 --> 01:08:54.926
It disappeared again!

01:08:55.051 --> 01:08:57.845
Look! Look.

01:08:58.054 --> 01:09:00.765
- Where'd it go?
- Look, where'd it go?

01:09:01.224 --> 01:09:02.434
- Amazing, right?
- It's really gone.

01:09:02.559 --> 01:09:03.935
Where was it before?

01:09:04.269 --> 01:09:05.520
- Where was it before?
- Here.

01:09:05.770 --> 01:09:09.482
Maybe it's here again?
Maybe it's here again, or here?

01:09:09.649 --> 01:09:10.859
No, no, it's not there.

01:09:11.109 --> 01:09:13.528
Where, where, what?
Where, where.

01:09:13.653 --> 01:09:15.238
Look, it's gone!

01:09:16.279 --> 01:09:17.323
What's that?

01:09:17.448 --> 01:09:19.701
What are you doing!

01:09:21.953 --> 01:09:23.872
Idiot! Cut it out, cut it out.

01:09:24.122 --> 01:09:25.582
- That's all?
- No, no, no.

01:09:25.707 --> 01:09:27.584
- That's all.
- No!

01:09:27.707 --> 01:09:28.835
Ouch!

01:09:29.461 --> 01:09:31.046
I had thought it was amazing.

01:09:31.252 --> 01:09:32.212
Don't do that.

01:09:32.462 --> 01:09:33.546
All right, hey!

01:09:33.796 --> 01:09:35.050
I can do some of it, too.

01:09:35.216 --> 01:09:37.551
I'll show you a more amazing
trick. You'll be shocked!

01:09:37.801 --> 01:09:40.054
- Bring the deck of cards.
- I know that trick.

01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:42.932
Don't tell them, you dummy!

01:09:43.099 --> 01:09:45.475
Don't get up!
Do that over there.

01:09:47.645 --> 01:09:48.729
Find it?

01:09:49.229 --> 01:09:51.398
- No.
- Below the red one.

01:09:52.649 --> 01:09:53.609
Hey.

01:09:55.487 --> 01:09:57.404
He said,
"Don't make your sister do it".

01:09:57.655 --> 01:09:58.739
Do what?

01:09:59.490 --> 01:10:00.617
This.

01:10:02.452 --> 01:10:03.536
Who did?

01:10:04.203 --> 01:10:05.663
The Yamatoya guy.

01:10:06.831 --> 01:10:08.875
Of course, it's still too early
for Lin to...

01:10:10.292 --> 01:10:11.252
Find it?

01:10:11.836 --> 01:10:12.837
I can't.

01:10:14.005 --> 01:10:17.300
What are you doing?
It shouldn't be hard to find.

01:10:40.823 --> 01:10:43.826
You old fart,
you'll catch a cold.

01:10:47.122 --> 01:10:48.539
Oh, fireworks.

01:10:49.082 --> 01:10:51.084
On the Sumida River.

01:10:52.042 --> 01:10:54.461
In the old days,
we went every year.

01:10:54.962 --> 01:10:57.965
After I got rained on one year,
I stopped going.

01:10:58.091 --> 01:10:59.843
Rain cancels fireworks.

01:11:00.010 --> 01:11:01.344
Can't see them, right?

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:03.137
Sounds only.

01:11:03.345 --> 01:11:04.305
Can't see them.

01:11:04.514 --> 01:11:05.806
It's almost over.

01:11:06.891 --> 01:11:08.100
The show's over.

01:11:08.976 --> 01:11:10.144
All over?

01:11:13.856 --> 01:11:16.984
That huge one.
What's it called? The Peony?

01:11:19.904 --> 01:11:22.114
The one that tumbles down
is the Willow.

01:11:28.121 --> 01:11:29.914
See, look.

01:11:30.164 --> 01:11:32.751
- I can't see a thing.
- Can't see, but listen to it.

01:12:04.365 --> 01:12:05.324
What else?

01:12:05.533 --> 01:12:07.786
A cloud that looks like a fish.

01:12:07.993 --> 01:12:09.078
You're right.

01:12:10.247 --> 01:12:11.623
Does it look like a whale?

01:12:11.831 --> 01:12:13.792
- A fish.
- Is it?

01:12:36.564 --> 01:12:39.525
Shota, hurry up and blow it up!

01:12:45.239 --> 01:12:47.367
A huge wave!

01:12:54.373 --> 01:12:55.708
Amazing.

01:12:57.252 --> 01:13:00.839
Shota, you like boobs?

01:13:01.088 --> 01:13:02.047
Not especially.

01:13:02.298 --> 01:13:04.091
Liar, I saw you looking.

01:13:05.385 --> 01:13:06.552
Why?

01:13:06.802 --> 01:13:09.555
It's all right.
All men like boobs.

01:13:11.099 --> 01:13:12.559
Your Daddy loves them, too.

01:13:15.979 --> 01:13:17.021
Tell me.

01:13:18.439 --> 01:13:21.692
Are you getting big down there
in the mornings?

01:13:21.902 --> 01:13:23.444
Why?

01:13:24.487 --> 01:13:25.572
Right?

01:13:26.197 --> 01:13:27.239
Everybody does?

01:13:27.489 --> 01:13:30.117
Everybody does. All men do.

01:13:31.328 --> 01:13:32.579
Feel better?

01:13:33.287 --> 01:13:34.872
I thought maybe I was sick.

01:13:35.081 --> 01:13:36.123
You're healthy!

01:13:37.167 --> 01:13:38.001
Great!

01:13:46.635 --> 01:13:47.761
Feels good?

01:13:56.144 --> 01:13:57.354
It's cold!

01:14:02.484 --> 01:14:03.443
Say...

01:14:04.277 --> 01:14:05.904
it's just like I said, right?

01:14:06.154 --> 01:14:08.573
It's not going to last long.

01:14:09.365 --> 01:14:10.908
I know that.

01:14:13.619 --> 01:14:17.539
But sometimes, it's better
to choose your own family.

01:14:17.957 --> 01:14:22.002
If only not to
have expectations.

01:14:22.671 --> 01:14:23.755
Yeah, it is.

01:14:27.884 --> 01:14:32.471
Lady, when I look closely,
you're a good-looking woman.

01:14:36.393 --> 01:14:37.476
What did you say?

01:14:38.185 --> 01:14:39.311
Your face.

01:14:46.069 --> 01:14:47.279
I'm off.

01:15:01.710 --> 01:15:06.172
Oh, look at all the age spots.

01:15:22.271 --> 01:15:27.860
Thank you.

01:15:34.408 --> 01:15:36.493
Watch out, Shota!

01:15:40.916 --> 01:15:41.875
Watch out!

01:15:42.082 --> 01:15:43.792
Hey, those...

01:15:46.128 --> 01:15:48.797
That's not a swimsuit,
they're underpants.

01:16:32.967 --> 01:16:34.010
What is it?

01:16:35.302 --> 01:16:36.805
Don't open it suddenly.

01:16:38.014 --> 01:16:39.599
My tooth came out.

01:16:39.849 --> 01:16:40.891
Your tooth?

01:16:58.368 --> 01:17:02.080
You say, "Please grow a strong
tooth" and then you throw it.

01:17:03.832 --> 01:17:06.459
Say, "Grow back in,"
and throw it.

01:17:08.837 --> 01:17:10.171
Grandma.

01:17:13.382 --> 01:17:14.634
Wake up.

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:17.220
Wake up.

01:17:19.389 --> 01:17:20.806
Wake up.

01:17:23.393 --> 01:17:24.978
C'mon, wake up.

01:17:29.149 --> 01:17:30.442
Hey, Grandma.

01:17:31.234 --> 01:17:32.319
Grandma!

01:17:33.319 --> 01:17:34.487
Oh, no, Aki!

01:17:34.779 --> 01:17:36.489
Get me the phone!

01:17:38.867 --> 01:17:40.118
Move.

01:17:43.579 --> 01:17:45.789
- What the hell!
- She's dead.

01:17:46.875 --> 01:17:49.002
Look at her, she's not
coming back to life.

01:17:52.087 --> 01:17:53.840
We can't call an ambulance here.

01:18:01.389 --> 01:18:02.806
There's nothing we can do.

01:18:03.475 --> 01:18:05.644
We each get our turn.

01:18:11.774 --> 01:18:14.693
What about a funeral?
Or cremation?

01:18:14.903 --> 01:18:16.820
We don't have money for that.

01:18:17.197 --> 01:18:18.323
But, you...

01:18:21.408 --> 01:18:23.327
Let's just stay by her side
a little longer.

01:18:24.703 --> 01:18:27.623
She gets lonely too, right?

01:18:35.215 --> 01:18:37.217
What? No, you...

01:18:37.801 --> 01:18:39.678
Lin, you...

01:18:40.427 --> 01:18:43.430
You don't want to say goodbye
to Grandma, do you?

01:18:43.681 --> 01:18:44.640
No.

01:19:30.145 --> 01:19:33.106
Listen, this is a big secret.

01:19:34.815 --> 01:19:36.818
Grandma was never here.

01:19:37.444 --> 01:19:39.237
It's been always
five in our family.

01:19:40.654 --> 01:19:41.614
Got it?

01:19:42.990 --> 01:19:44.033
Yeah.

01:20:11.478 --> 01:20:13.646
I can't believe
we're burying another one.

01:20:15.148 --> 01:20:18.318
But this is really different
from that time.

01:20:20.319 --> 01:20:21.487
You're right.

01:20:23.657 --> 01:20:26.618
Depending on
how you think about,

01:20:28.703 --> 01:20:29.955
Grandma must be happy.

01:20:30.622 --> 01:20:32.249
Of course she is.

01:20:32.666 --> 01:20:34.918
So much better than dying alone.

01:20:42.716 --> 01:20:44.009
There's more.

01:20:57.274 --> 01:20:59.067
You know, when I die...

01:20:59.442 --> 01:21:01.403
What?

01:21:06.658 --> 01:21:08.702
Bury me under the pond
in the yard.

01:21:14.666 --> 01:21:17.168
That pond isn't big enough.

01:21:18.752 --> 01:21:19.962
You're right.

01:21:29.389 --> 01:21:32.225
Wait, you always walk out wet.
Wipe your feet.

01:21:32.434 --> 01:21:33.643
I know that.

01:22:02.671 --> 01:22:03.881
How much?

01:22:04.506 --> 01:22:06.425
116,000 yen.

01:22:07.927 --> 01:22:09.136
Whose money?

01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:11.263
It's Grandma's money.

01:22:12.932 --> 01:22:14.184
So, it's not bad.

01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:15.935
It's not bad.

01:22:19.021 --> 01:22:20.564
What about shoplifting?

01:22:22.692 --> 01:22:24.319
What does your father say?

01:22:25.612 --> 01:22:29.449
Whatever's in a store
doesn't belong to anyone yet.

01:22:37.791 --> 01:22:41.211
Well, as long as the store
doesn't go bankrupt, it's OK.

01:22:52.264 --> 01:22:54.849
Hello, young mother, croquettes
for your son?

01:22:58.103 --> 01:23:00.230
Do you like being called mother?

01:23:01.314 --> 01:23:02.440
By whom?

01:23:03.649 --> 01:23:04.733
By Lin.

01:23:05.777 --> 01:23:07.529
I won't know until she does.

01:23:10.239 --> 01:23:12.617
Why do you ask me that?

01:23:13.702 --> 01:23:17.122
Because he wants me
to call him "Dad."

01:23:19.164 --> 01:23:20.332
But you can't.

01:23:21.292 --> 01:23:22.710
No, not yet.

01:23:27.923 --> 01:23:31.552
It's really not a big deal.
So, don't worry about it.

01:23:33.095 --> 01:23:34.138
OK.

01:23:44.940 --> 01:23:46.318
What was that?

01:23:48.612 --> 01:23:49.779
You try it.

01:23:58.496 --> 01:24:00.414
Grandma's amazing,

01:24:00.623 --> 01:24:03.042
she keeps helping us out
even after she's dead.

01:24:03.752 --> 01:24:06.713
Well, the really helpful one
is the old man.

01:24:11.885 --> 01:24:13.261
What can you see?

01:24:14.136 --> 01:24:15.471
What? The ocean.

01:24:18.682 --> 01:24:19.893
The universe.

01:24:20.685 --> 01:24:21.811
Universe?

01:24:22.645 --> 01:24:25.023
Found it! Found it!
I knew she'd stashed some away!

01:24:25.231 --> 01:24:26.858
With her dentures.

01:24:27.234 --> 01:24:28.360
For real?

01:24:28.984 --> 01:24:31.320
There it is, amazing!

01:24:35.533 --> 01:24:38.495
It's in there? It is.

01:24:38.703 --> 01:24:41.164
- Wow, amazing!
- 10, 11, 12.

01:24:41.372 --> 01:24:44.500
13, 14, 15!

01:24:46.795 --> 01:24:49.172
Amazing! That's 30,000 yen each.

01:24:49.838 --> 01:24:51.841
Did Grandma have a scam going?

01:24:52.384 --> 01:24:53.551
Money is money.

01:25:09.024 --> 01:25:10.025
Hey.

01:25:10.527 --> 01:25:11.528
What?

01:25:12.570 --> 01:25:14.447
Don't these belong to someone?

01:25:20.953 --> 01:25:22.079
So, what?

01:25:25.625 --> 01:25:26.585
What?

01:25:31.881 --> 01:25:32.840
Hey.

01:25:34.717 --> 01:25:37.804
You want to try this, too?

01:25:38.637 --> 01:25:40.556
Hey, hey!

01:25:43.350 --> 01:25:45.603
In that case, hey...

01:25:46.896 --> 01:25:49.440
You be the lookout
by the stairs, OK?

01:26:11.212 --> 01:26:12.838
This is amazing.

01:26:17.051 --> 01:26:18.302
Back when...

01:26:20.012 --> 01:26:21.305
When you saved me...

01:26:21.472 --> 01:26:22.515
What!

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:26.186
Were you trying to steal
something from the car, too?

01:26:27.270 --> 01:26:28.730
No, you dummy.

01:26:29.104 --> 01:26:32.817
That time, I was just trying
to save you.

01:26:37.529 --> 01:26:39.198
Shoot! Hey! Come!

01:27:01.805 --> 01:27:03.847
"In mourning."
What does this mean?

01:27:16.027 --> 01:27:17.194
Day off?

01:27:18.738 --> 01:27:20.155
Did it go bankrupt?

01:27:29.082 --> 01:27:30.542
Welcome!

01:27:31.417 --> 01:27:32.543
You wait here.

01:27:42.595 --> 01:27:43.888
Welcome!

01:28:27.474 --> 01:28:28.475
Hey.

01:28:36.899 --> 01:28:37.858
Hey!

01:28:55.710 --> 01:28:57.212
Hey, you!

01:29:31.704 --> 01:29:32.663
Hey!

01:29:59.064 --> 01:30:01.400
- Shibata Shota.
- Shibata Shota.

01:30:01.902 --> 01:30:03.360
How do you write that?

01:30:04.570 --> 01:30:06.155
The standard Shibata,
like the ballplayer.

01:30:06.363 --> 01:30:07.531
Like the ballplayer.

01:30:07.740 --> 01:30:10.409
For "Sho,"
the character with sheep

01:30:10.743 --> 01:30:12.871
and for "ta,"
the character for thick.

01:30:13.078 --> 01:30:15.206
- How old is he?
- Oh, wait.

01:30:19.336 --> 01:30:21.838
He broke his leg,
but he didn't hit his head.

01:30:22.546 --> 01:30:24.924
Excuse me,
are you Shota's mother?

01:30:25.591 --> 01:30:26.467
Yes.

01:30:26.592 --> 01:30:28.636
You'll need to come with us
to the police precinct.

01:30:28.761 --> 01:30:30.846
Oh, I just came to get him.

01:30:30.971 --> 01:30:33.182
I left my other child at home.

01:30:33.307 --> 01:30:35.560
We have to get
his insurance card and things.

01:30:35.769 --> 01:30:38.188
- We'll be right back.
- I'm sorry, our other child...

01:30:38.354 --> 01:30:40.856
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:30:45.237 --> 01:30:46.529
Listen.

01:30:46.738 --> 01:30:48.405
- Give me that.
- No.

01:30:48.907 --> 01:30:50.367
- Why not?
- No!

01:30:51.993 --> 01:30:54.663
OK, that's OK.

01:30:55.329 --> 01:30:58.123
Listen, if they ask your name,
you tell them it's Lin.

01:30:58.416 --> 01:30:59.543
And if they ask you
about Grandma,

01:30:59.708 --> 01:31:00.710
tell them you don't know her.

01:31:00.877 --> 01:31:02.462
What about Brother?

01:31:02.712 --> 01:31:04.089
Shota? We'll go get him later.

01:31:04.296 --> 01:31:07.716
That's right. They'll feed him
at the hospital.

01:31:07.926 --> 01:31:09.427
Let's put Lin's shoes on here.

01:31:09.636 --> 01:31:10.887
Don't bother.

01:31:39.916 --> 01:31:42.752
Wow, what a pretty color.

01:31:45.546 --> 01:31:47.464
So, it was a beautiful day.

01:31:47.882 --> 01:31:49.509
Amazing.

01:31:53.805 --> 01:31:54.847
Juri.

01:31:56.515 --> 01:31:58.643
How many of you
went to the beach?

01:32:01.479 --> 01:32:02.606
Five people.

01:32:02.730 --> 01:32:04.189
- Five people.
- Five people.

01:32:05.649 --> 01:32:07.192
What were you doing
at the beach?

01:32:07.610 --> 01:32:08.612
Jumping.

01:32:08.819 --> 01:32:09.862
Jumping?

01:32:13.574 --> 01:32:16.493
Was your grandma with you then?

01:32:24.461 --> 01:32:27.672
Where were you living?

01:32:29.841 --> 01:32:31.092
In a car.

01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:33.470
In a car?

01:32:34.511 --> 01:32:35.846
All alone?

01:32:36.347 --> 01:32:37.306
Yes.

01:32:41.185 --> 01:32:44.063
Are you covering up for someone?

01:32:48.359 --> 01:32:49.818
When we got to the house,

01:32:50.819 --> 01:32:52.780
they were all

01:32:53.698 --> 01:32:57.410
packing their things up
and trying to run away,

01:32:58.036 --> 01:32:59.412
abandoning you.

01:33:01.622 --> 01:33:04.500
A real family would
never treat you like that.

01:33:16.971 --> 01:33:19.181
The man's real name is
Enoki Shota,

01:33:19.724 --> 01:33:21.601
the woman is Tanabe Yuko.

01:33:26.064 --> 01:33:28.108
They had killed someone?

01:33:30.944 --> 01:33:32.237
Her previous husband.

01:33:33.738 --> 01:33:35.657
Stabbed him, killed him
and buried him.

01:33:36.658 --> 01:33:38.326
Tangled up
in a crime of passion.

01:33:42.247 --> 01:33:43.414
That's how those two...

01:33:44.416 --> 01:33:45.917
are connected.

01:33:49.671 --> 01:33:52.257
That was self-defense, right?

01:33:53.507 --> 01:33:56.051
If we hadn't killed him,
he would've killed us both.

01:33:58.345 --> 01:34:00.431
Well, that's how
the judge ruled.

01:34:03.435 --> 01:34:05.979
And what does that
have to do with this situation?

01:34:08.355 --> 01:34:10.817
No, it wasn't a kidnapping.

01:34:11.609 --> 01:34:14.362
She looked like
she was starving,

01:34:14.945 --> 01:34:17.407
so Nobuyo brought her home.

01:34:18.033 --> 01:34:20.368
And the girl was happy
to come with her.

01:34:22.119 --> 01:34:23.329
When was that?

01:34:25.623 --> 01:34:26.875
Last February.

01:34:28.710 --> 01:34:30.837
That's what we call kidnapping.

01:34:31.796 --> 01:34:33.882
That's what I told her too,

01:34:35.132 --> 01:34:36.425
but she said...

01:34:37.176 --> 01:34:40.221
we weren't demanding a ransom,

01:34:40.805 --> 01:34:42.349
so we were protecting her.

01:34:44.475 --> 01:34:47.436
Thank you for coming.

01:34:48.063 --> 01:34:49.564
How is Juri doing?

01:34:50.148 --> 01:34:51.190
Yes.

01:34:51.774 --> 01:34:55.778
I guess she was relieved.
She fell fast asleep.

01:34:56.404 --> 01:34:59.991
Nozomi,
what did Juri eat yesterday?

01:35:01.618 --> 01:35:03.078
Her favorite,
omelet with rice.

01:35:03.286 --> 01:35:04.412
You cooked it
for your daughter?

01:35:05.329 --> 01:35:07.122
Yes, I cooked it.

01:35:18.426 --> 01:35:19.636
That's because...

01:35:20.761 --> 01:35:24.056
Grandma asked me to
move in with her.

01:35:28.019 --> 01:35:31.648
But that wasn't out of kindness.

01:35:36.944 --> 01:35:39.154
She was getting money
from the family

01:35:39.738 --> 01:35:41.699
that stole her husband.

01:35:46.371 --> 01:35:47.454
Money?

01:35:48.038 --> 01:35:49.582
From my parents?

01:35:50.958 --> 01:35:53.295
They paid her
every time she visited.

01:35:56.213 --> 01:36:01.760
What? So, my parents knew
that I was living with her?

01:36:03.137 --> 01:36:05.681
Your parents say
they didn't know, but...

01:36:24.158 --> 01:36:25.409
So, Grandma...

01:36:28.371 --> 01:36:30.498
only wanted their money?

01:36:33.710 --> 01:36:34.920
Not me.

01:36:41.426 --> 01:36:44.512
Where is your grandma now?

01:36:51.770 --> 01:36:55.732
We're outside the house where
Shibata Hatsue was discovered.

01:36:55.940 --> 01:36:58.359
Several weeks have passed since
she died,

01:36:58.568 --> 01:37:00.654
and the police
are investigating,

01:37:00.819 --> 01:37:03.113
including the possibility
of murder.

01:37:03.948 --> 01:37:07.076
What the people who
pretended to be her family

01:37:07.284 --> 01:37:11.581
were doing in this house
remains shrouded in mystery.

01:37:15.126 --> 01:37:17.753
So, you say you did it
all by yourself?

01:37:19.588 --> 01:37:20.548
Yes.

01:37:24.051 --> 01:37:26.595
The digging and the burying.

01:37:28.974 --> 01:37:30.225
That's right.

01:37:31.475 --> 01:37:32.893
I did it all myself.

01:37:34.061 --> 01:37:36.689
Corpse disposal carries
a heavy sentence.

01:37:38.149 --> 01:37:39.359
Do you understand?

01:37:41.653 --> 01:37:43.070
I didn't throw her away.

01:37:45.614 --> 01:37:46.740
Yes, you did.

01:37:46.949 --> 01:37:48.284
I didn't throw her away.

01:37:52.079 --> 01:37:53.206
I found her.

01:37:57.668 --> 01:37:59.671
Someone threw her away
and I found her.

01:38:05.260 --> 01:38:07.887
It was someone else
who threw her away.

01:38:12.100 --> 01:38:13.602
Didn't you feel guilty

01:38:14.728 --> 01:38:16.354
making children shoplift?

01:38:22.444 --> 01:38:23.528
I...

01:38:25.279 --> 01:38:29.242
don't know anything else
to teach them.

01:38:33.037 --> 01:38:34.455
But still...

01:38:38.542 --> 01:38:42.546
Why did you name the boy Shota?

01:38:45.216 --> 01:38:46.884
That's your real name, right?

01:39:10.242 --> 01:39:11.534
Is it an apartment?

01:39:12.827 --> 01:39:14.371
A two-story house.

01:39:18.082 --> 01:39:21.835
You'll live there
with six other children.

01:39:23.921 --> 01:39:25.673
- Just with other kids?
- Yes.

01:39:27.259 --> 01:39:31.346
You could commute to school
from there, Shota.

01:39:35.766 --> 01:39:39.019
I thought only kids who can't
study at home go to school.

01:39:44.775 --> 01:39:46.110
There are some things

01:39:46.903 --> 01:39:48.655
you can't study at home.

01:39:49.447 --> 01:39:50.489
Like what?

01:39:55.119 --> 01:39:56.537
Meeting people.

01:39:57.913 --> 01:39:59.498
Making new friends.

01:40:02.042 --> 01:40:03.545
How is Lin doing?

01:40:10.594 --> 01:40:12.345
She went back to her family.

01:40:13.137 --> 01:40:14.471
Her real family?

01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:16.766
Yeah.

01:40:22.730 --> 01:40:26.025
Shota, if you, too...

01:40:27.652 --> 01:40:30.070
But I don't remember anything.

01:41:08.109 --> 01:41:09.653
You know, this...

01:41:09.778 --> 01:41:14.032
Listen, I'm busy. Go away.

01:41:18.536 --> 01:41:19.788
That hurts.

01:41:21.581 --> 01:41:23.458
I told you not to touch me.

01:41:24.542 --> 01:41:25.960
Just go away.

01:41:32.132 --> 01:41:33.467
Say you're sorry.

01:41:37.889 --> 01:41:39.599
Say you're sorry.

01:41:51.653 --> 01:41:52.695
Juri...

01:41:54.238 --> 01:41:57.491
I'll buy you new clothes,
so come over here.

01:42:01.829 --> 01:42:03.414
Why not? Come here.

01:42:10.171 --> 01:42:12.465
Lin said she wanted to go back?

01:42:13.257 --> 01:42:15.217
Yes, Juri is her name.

01:42:18.054 --> 01:42:21.307
No, she would never say that.

01:42:24.603 --> 01:42:28.648
Children need their mothers.

01:42:33.944 --> 01:42:36.697
That's just what
mothers imagine.

01:42:43.454 --> 01:42:45.707
Giving birth automatically
makes you a mother?

01:42:49.377 --> 01:42:51.546
You can't become a mother
unless you do.

01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:59.387
I understand it's tough
for you that can't give birth.

01:43:01.472 --> 01:43:02.765
Were you jealous?

01:43:03.807 --> 01:43:05.351
Is that why you kidnapped her?

01:43:12.900 --> 01:43:14.193
Maybe.

01:43:16.820 --> 01:43:19.114
Maybe I hated her, my mother.

01:43:22.452 --> 01:43:24.204
What did the two children

01:43:25.497 --> 01:43:27.539
call you?

01:43:34.965 --> 01:43:36.091
Mommy?

01:43:37.759 --> 01:43:38.885
Mother?

01:44:18.382 --> 01:44:19.842
I wonder...

01:44:39.988 --> 01:44:41.364
I wonder...

01:45:58.149 --> 01:46:00.777
There are two types of lures.

01:46:00.985 --> 01:46:04.029
There are soft lures,
made of rubber.

01:46:04.530 --> 01:46:07.826
They look like small fish
or worms,

01:46:07.993 --> 01:46:10.912
to catch other fish, they say.

01:46:12.831 --> 01:46:16.251
And the other type...

01:46:16.835 --> 01:46:20.963
is the hard lure,
it's called the hard lure.

01:46:21.171 --> 01:46:24.341
They're made from
wood or plastic,

01:46:25.426 --> 01:46:30.055
and they're used to catch
big fish and things like that.

01:46:32.516 --> 01:46:34.269
Where did you learn all that?

01:46:36.313 --> 01:46:37.480
It was in a book.

01:46:37.771 --> 01:46:38.939
In a book.

01:46:44.820 --> 01:46:46.614
I'm sorry,
you're doing my time, too.

01:46:46.907 --> 01:46:48.574
You've got a record.

01:46:50.159 --> 01:46:52.287
You wouldn't get away
with just five years.

01:46:53.496 --> 01:46:54.706
But you...

01:46:55.332 --> 01:46:57.417
I had such a good time,

01:46:59.627 --> 01:47:01.837
this is nothing, really.

01:47:04.298 --> 01:47:05.507
I'm sorry.

01:47:07.135 --> 01:47:08.845
It's because I got caught.

01:47:12.306 --> 01:47:15.268
Don't worry about it.
Things don't always work out.

01:47:16.853 --> 01:47:17.811
Right?

01:47:18.939 --> 01:47:20.606
How is the facility?

01:47:21.315 --> 01:47:23.234
Are you going to school
every day?

01:47:23.443 --> 01:47:26.320
Yes, I got 8th place
in my Japanese test.

01:47:28.030 --> 01:47:30.033
You're smart, Shota, right?

01:47:31.993 --> 01:47:33.787
Did you cut your hair?

01:47:36.538 --> 01:47:38.582
You look good, let's see.

01:47:38.832 --> 01:47:40.251
He looks good, right?

01:47:40.502 --> 01:47:42.754
You look cute, cute.

01:47:42.962 --> 01:47:45.005
Doesn't he look handsome?

01:47:47.384 --> 01:47:48.592
You look sweet.

01:47:53.472 --> 01:47:54.431
Shota.

01:47:55.684 --> 01:47:56.685
Listen...

01:47:57.894 --> 01:47:59.436
We found you...

01:48:00.479 --> 01:48:02.189
at the pachinko parlor.

01:48:03.024 --> 01:48:04.651
The pachinko parlor in Matsudo.

01:48:05.734 --> 01:48:08.153
The car was a red Toyota Vitz.

01:48:10.864 --> 01:48:13.158
The license plate was Narashino.

01:48:15.036 --> 01:48:16.078
Hey.

01:48:18.622 --> 01:48:20.000
If you really want to,

01:48:20.375 --> 01:48:22.752
you can find your
real mom and dad.

01:48:26.715 --> 01:48:27.673
Hey, you.

01:48:29.509 --> 01:48:32.511
Did you tell me to bring Shota
here so you could tell him that?

01:48:32.929 --> 01:48:33.930
That's right.

01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:39.059
You know it, too.

01:48:41.229 --> 01:48:44.106
We're not good enough for him.

01:49:00.206 --> 01:49:01.416
I'm done.

01:49:05.045 --> 01:49:06.087
Hey.

01:49:10.675 --> 01:49:11.676
Bye.

01:49:13.052 --> 01:49:14.011
Hey.

01:49:27.484 --> 01:49:28.652
Wow, amazing!

01:49:40.747 --> 01:49:44.292
So tasty, a super combo.

01:49:44.501 --> 01:49:45.627
Right?

01:49:47.796 --> 01:49:49.338
Who taught you this?

01:49:54.511 --> 01:49:55.387
Me?

01:50:01.893 --> 01:50:05.313
Do you live here all alone?

01:50:07.856 --> 01:50:09.192
It's tiny

01:50:10.277 --> 01:50:12.194
but the bath is brand new.

01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:14.530
Want a bath later?

01:50:17.658 --> 01:50:18.909
I'm not sure.

01:50:19.202 --> 01:50:21.121
You're more than welcome to.

01:50:22.413 --> 01:50:23.747
The bath is super clean.

01:50:25.332 --> 01:50:26.960
Maybe I'll spend the night here.

01:50:29.753 --> 01:50:31.422
But won't they get mad at you?

01:50:33.966 --> 01:50:35.676
No different if I go back now.

01:50:38.721 --> 01:50:39.764
Right.

01:50:56.030 --> 01:50:57.073
Hey, Shota.

01:50:58.324 --> 01:50:59.326
Shota!

01:51:00.659 --> 01:51:01.827
Come out here.

01:51:08.627 --> 01:51:10.045
The snow's piling up.

01:51:15.257 --> 01:51:16.509
Hey, be careful.

01:51:26.101 --> 01:51:27.645
Let's make a snowman!

01:52:29.623 --> 01:52:32.001
Tomorrow, you go home, right?

01:52:34.045 --> 01:52:35.005
Yup.

01:52:36.338 --> 01:52:37.506
Right.

01:52:42.887 --> 01:52:43.846
Say...

01:52:46.307 --> 01:52:48.393
Did you try to run away
without me?

01:53:02.239 --> 01:53:03.198
Yeah.

01:53:06.077 --> 01:53:07.369
It's true.

01:53:10.748 --> 01:53:12.833
But we got caught, first.

01:53:15.337 --> 01:53:16.463
I see.

01:53:19.090 --> 01:53:20.257
I'm sorry.

01:53:29.266 --> 01:53:30.476
From now on...

01:53:33.729 --> 01:53:35.564
I'm not your dad.

01:53:47.953 --> 01:53:48.912
Yup.

01:54:11.434 --> 01:54:13.103
You tell them you're sorry.

01:54:16.398 --> 01:54:18.817
Tell them I made you
spend the night.

01:54:20.318 --> 01:54:21.903
Right, I'll do that.

01:54:26.574 --> 01:54:28.867
I'm sorry, I can't see you.

01:54:28.993 --> 01:54:30.452
I got caught.

01:54:32.413 --> 01:54:34.748
I got caught on purpose.

01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:42.882
I see.

01:54:56.645 --> 01:54:57.646
Hey, Shota.

01:55:15.539 --> 01:55:17.333
Shota! Shota!

01:55:50.783 --> 01:55:52.117
Dad.

01:55:58.875 --> 01:56:02.420
One... Two...

01:56:02.671 --> 01:56:05.840
Buckle my shoe

01:56:06.048 --> 01:56:09.761
Three, four, knock at the door

01:56:11.762 --> 01:56:15.600
Five, six, pick up sticks

01:56:16.475 --> 01:56:19.853
Seven, eight, lay them straight

01:56:20.063 --> 01:56:24.275
Nine, ten, a big fat hen

01:56:24.734 --> 01:56:26.695
One, two...
