00:15.330 --> 00:16.470
Oh.

00:25.610 --> 00:26.480
Hi.

00:27.680 --> 00:29.550
- You're Peter Maldonado?
- Yeah.

00:30.380 --> 00:32.549
The one who's making
this American Vandal thing?

00:32.619 --> 00:34.320
Yeah, yeah, it's a documentary.

00:34.380 --> 00:37.250
- Thank you so much for taking the time...
- Yeah, so, we've had, um,

00:37.320 --> 00:40.120
hundreds of phone calls,
all hours of the night,

00:40.190 --> 00:43.630
about some Kiefer Sutherland message
on my father's answering machine?

00:43.690 --> 00:46.130
That's why I'm here.
Any way I could get the tape?

00:46.200 --> 00:48.800
- I would be really grateful.
- The tape? Oh, I... This one?

00:49.060 --> 00:50.070
- Yes. Yes.
- Tape?

00:50.130 --> 00:51.500
- Thank you so mu...
- This tape...

00:53.300 --> 00:55.740
This tape is now trash.

00:56.370 --> 01:00.410
So, you can tell everyone to stop calling,
because it's harassment.

01:29.540 --> 01:32.540
The theory that Dylan
did the dicks to win back Mackenzie

01:32.610 --> 01:33.510
makes sense.

01:34.310 --> 01:36.550
Out of anyone with access
to the security footage,

01:36.610 --> 01:38.450
Dylan still seems the most likely.

01:38.710 --> 01:41.550
So, more than ever, he needed good news.

01:42.420 --> 01:45.790
That's why watching Mrs. Janson
destroy the Kiefer Sutherland voicemail

01:45.890 --> 01:47.420
was such a punch to the gut.

01:48.360 --> 01:52.800
If we'd heard Dylan on that voicemail,
it would've given him a solid alibi.

01:53.800 --> 01:57.170
Mrs. Janson destroyed the tape
because she claims she felt harassed.

01:57.230 --> 01:59.540
And I can't help
but feel responsible for that.

02:00.600 --> 02:03.140
I started posting the documentary
a few weeks ago.

02:03.210 --> 02:06.510
And almost immediately,
people started getting involved.

02:07.610 --> 02:09.150
It comes down to this.

02:09.610 --> 02:12.920
If I hadn't uploaded the doc,
then that tape would still exist.

02:13.420 --> 02:17.550
But it's lost forever,
because American Vandal has gone viral.

02:18.550 --> 02:20.460
- Dylan, I got some news.
- What's up?

02:20.520 --> 02:22.760
I went to Mr. Janson's house...

02:23.560 --> 02:28.200
and, um, his daughter
answered the door...

02:29.430 --> 02:31.930
and she destroyed the voicemail.

02:36.310 --> 02:37.510
Fuck, dude.

02:41.910 --> 02:43.210
Fuck.

02:46.220 --> 02:47.250
It's okay, man.

02:47.850 --> 02:49.920
You have a lot of people
believing in you now.

02:50.520 --> 02:52.520
You should see the school. It's crazy.

02:59.630 --> 03:01.660
It's either Dylan
or Kiefer Sutherland.

03:01.730 --> 03:04.630
Kiefer Sutherland's,
like, a super-rich actor.

03:04.700 --> 03:07.240
You know, why would he be prank-calling
some old guy?

03:08.500 --> 03:09.370
Okay, medium.

03:10.370 --> 03:11.670
There you go. Have a good one.

03:12.270 --> 03:14.540
The documentary is killing it right now.

03:14.610 --> 03:17.450
What, you have hundreds of thousands
of views or something?

03:18.650 --> 03:20.250
This isn't about dicks.

03:20.350 --> 03:25.690
This is a commentary on the justice system
and how it's failed everyone.

03:25.750 --> 03:28.490
When you were making it,
I thought it was gonna be like...

03:28.560 --> 03:30.830
You were just gonna show it
to kids in the school.

03:31.760 --> 03:35.460
Between me and you,
I didn't know it'd go viral.

03:35.530 --> 03:38.370
We lost Pizza Hut, and Jack in the Box.

03:38.430 --> 03:40.700
I'm the off-campus lunch guy,
is what they call me.

03:40.770 --> 03:42.640
It's really cool. People buy my lunch.

03:42.710 --> 03:45.240
Our YouTube channel?
Skyrocketing right now, man.

03:45.310 --> 03:48.880
We had 260 subscribers.
Now it's, like, pushing 700.

03:49.880 --> 03:53.920
Kind of wish I hadn't, heh,
said some of the stuff that I said.

03:53.980 --> 03:58.490
You know, I'm not gonna say
one of my students is unbelievably hot...

03:59.790 --> 04:01.260
But, oh, my God, dude.

04:01.690 --> 04:04.790
Man, that's like... I really wish
I hadn't said a lot of that stuff.

04:06.330 --> 04:09.370
I have to admit,
it's a lot for me to process.

04:09.600 --> 04:12.370
No one ever listened to me
when I hosted the Morning Show,

04:12.430 --> 04:13.900
but everyone is listening now.

04:14.900 --> 04:17.640
Pete.
People love American Vandal, dude.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.740
- I know, man. It's crazy.
- Hi.

04:20.540 --> 04:22.280
Honestly,
I think Sam's being soft.

04:22.340 --> 04:25.510
You say soft.
I think Peter went a little too far.

04:25.580 --> 04:28.880
If I were Sam, I'd have reacted
the same way. You're his best friend.

04:28.950 --> 04:32.590
I think... I don't think
that it is that farfetched that...

04:32.660 --> 04:35.560
I mean, Sam, he did have motive.
He did have access.

04:35.620 --> 04:36.730
I just don't... I don't...

04:36.790 --> 04:40.300
You're fine if I tell the school
you're in love with Ashley Hanson,

04:40.360 --> 04:44.330
you're fine with that? Cool, thanks.
Or how about I tell everyone

04:44.400 --> 04:46.640
that you jerk off
to American Apparel catalogs, huh?

04:46.700 --> 04:48.940
How does that feel, Peter?
Does that feel nice?

04:49.410 --> 04:52.880
Yo, this kid jerks off
to the American Apparel catalog.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.510
No, it doesn't feel nice.

04:54.940 --> 04:58.510
But some of the show's popularity
is pretty cool, I'm not gonna lie.

04:58.580 --> 05:01.050
Hey, Peter, do you think
I could do an interview, too?

05:01.320 --> 05:02.620
Everyone wants to be involved,

05:02.690 --> 05:06.360
with interviews, new information,
new theories. Some of it's helpful.

05:06.420 --> 05:08.420
- What are you filming?
- Yeah, where's Sam?

05:08.490 --> 05:09.990
- Most of it isn't.
- Peter.

05:10.060 --> 05:11.590
Peter, Baxter did it.

05:12.930 --> 05:14.730
Free Dylan is now a movement.

05:14.800 --> 05:17.000
Even though
he's not allowed at school to see it,

05:17.500 --> 05:19.900
Dylan is feeling the love back at home,
as well.

05:20.940 --> 05:24.710
"Our boy Dylan,
you are the motherfucking man."

05:25.370 --> 05:26.780
Stay strong, bro.

05:28.740 --> 05:29.880
"Your biggest fan."

05:33.080 --> 05:36.890
I think there was, like,
some Facebook group with my address in it.

05:39.090 --> 05:41.890
People have just been sending me
all these letters and shit,

05:41.960 --> 05:43.390
of, like, pictures of dicks.

05:44.860 --> 05:46.830
And there's,
like, a bunch of vaginas, too.

05:48.130 --> 05:49.030
Look at that shit.

05:50.630 --> 05:52.430
Look how skinny this vagina is.

05:52.970 --> 05:53.870
This one's, like...

05:54.800 --> 05:55.870
sad vag?

05:56.710 --> 05:58.970
This one's more
of, like, a shocked vagina.

06:00.680 --> 06:03.650
A lot of them have hair,
you know, in honor of my drawings.

06:04.680 --> 06:06.750
The ladies just kind of love me, I guess.

06:07.880 --> 06:09.790
I got a bunch of e-mails myself.

06:10.150 --> 06:11.150
Oh, vaginas?

06:11.550 --> 06:13.720
No, no, no,
I just got a bunch of fan theories.

06:13.790 --> 06:16.090
Hashtag "who drew the dicks" is trending
on Twitter.

06:16.160 --> 06:18.830
- Really?
- Yeah. Uh, hashtag "Sara Pearson did it,"

06:18.890 --> 06:21.760
hashtag "the janitor did it,"
which I didn't even think about.

06:23.100 --> 06:24.530
Dick deniers?

06:25.800 --> 06:29.000
Yo, these people are saying
there was never any dicks

06:29.070 --> 06:30.740
and it was just Photoshop.

06:32.840 --> 06:33.840
You think about that?

06:34.740 --> 06:38.980
Well, I mean... people were there,
they saw the dicks, so...

06:40.750 --> 06:42.080
I mean, I didn't see them.

06:42.890 --> 06:45.050
- Did you see them?
- It was on the news.

06:48.720 --> 06:50.190
Over the past two weeks,

06:50.460 --> 06:53.000
I've received dozens of theories
about who drew the dicks.

06:53.160 --> 06:57.130
I'm not gonna bore you with all of them,
but here are few high-trending theories.

06:57.500 --> 07:01.540
The most popular theory by far
is that Alex Trimboli drew the dicks.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.910
People have actually been mean about it.

07:04.740 --> 07:06.680
"It's obvious Trimboli drew the dicks.

07:07.110 --> 07:09.080
Why aren't you looking into Trimboli?"

07:09.140 --> 07:13.450
How come no one's looking into that?
Ever heard of "whoever smelt it dealt it"?

07:13.850 --> 07:14.920
Well, here's why.

07:14.980 --> 07:18.950
The security footage in the parking lot
was deleted between two and 2:30.

07:19.490 --> 07:22.090
But the security cameras inside
were running the whole time.

07:22.490 --> 07:26.130
We see Alex here at 2:13,
getting books from his locker.

07:26.200 --> 07:29.730
Then here at 2:15,
running to alert the teachers.

07:30.200 --> 07:33.540
So, unless Trimboli has some sort
of superhuman speed,

07:33.600 --> 07:34.740
we can rule this one out.

07:35.740 --> 07:37.010
Next we have Mr. Baxter.

07:37.470 --> 07:39.070
The teacher in charge of the Morning Show

07:39.140 --> 07:41.980
should be considered a suspect.
It makes sense.

07:42.040 --> 07:44.980
Mr. Baxter does have access
to the security footage,

07:45.050 --> 07:47.780
and a potential motive
to lash out against the school.

07:47.920 --> 07:50.590
It's rumored he's being pushed
into early retirement.

07:50.920 --> 07:53.820
Mr. Baxter,
where were you on March 15th,

07:53.890 --> 07:56.490
specifically between two and 2:30?

07:56.560 --> 08:02.100
Okay, okay. I was running the slide show
during the faculty meeting.

08:02.160 --> 08:04.170
This is a solid alibi.

08:04.230 --> 08:05.800
And even if he is lying,

08:05.870 --> 08:08.000
I just don't think Mr. Baxter
could've done it.

08:08.840 --> 08:11.570
Could he have deleted
the security footage? Yes.

08:11.640 --> 08:14.840
But could he have drawn 27 dicks
in 8.1 minutes?

08:15.510 --> 08:16.880
No. He's too fat.

08:17.680 --> 08:19.950
Another trending theory
is that the janitor did it.

08:20.620 --> 08:23.090
He did mysteriously discover
the spray paint can

08:23.150 --> 08:25.850
at the scene of the crime,
but most people are focusing on the fact

08:25.920 --> 08:27.660
that he looks creepy AF.

08:30.030 --> 08:31.190
Yeah, that dude's sketchy.

08:31.260 --> 08:33.960
Not just like janitor sketchy,
but like murder sketchy.

08:34.559 --> 08:36.770
Yeah, he's fucking weird, man.
Have you seen him?

08:37.130 --> 08:39.669
Yeah, he...
You guys gotta look into that guy.

08:39.740 --> 08:42.100
That guy might've... pulled some shit.

08:42.740 --> 08:44.970
Do you remember where you were
on March 15th?

08:45.040 --> 08:46.810
I know I was
nowhere near those cars.

08:47.740 --> 08:51.080
I was dealing with a... clog
in the shower.

08:52.110 --> 08:53.680
And a nasty one, too.

08:54.280 --> 08:55.680
Like, so much hair.

08:56.850 --> 08:58.950
Vice Principal Keene
backed up his alibi.

08:59.020 --> 09:02.690
And a quick trip to the boys'
locker room revealed tangible evidence.

09:03.630 --> 09:05.190
Here's an even crazier one.

09:05.560 --> 09:06.660
Sara Pearson.

09:07.660 --> 09:09.670
Her motive varies,
depending on who you ask.

09:10.100 --> 09:13.840
Some say she snapped after getting asked
to Spring Fling by too many freshmen.

09:13.900 --> 09:17.170
Others claim that she was angry
about the school's new wardrobe policy,

09:17.240 --> 09:18.310
which banned crop tops.

09:18.570 --> 09:19.310
But motives aside,

09:20.010 --> 09:23.010
most people agree
that her hairless dick-drawing style

09:23.080 --> 09:25.050
was based on the penis
of her ex-boyfriend,

09:25.110 --> 09:27.780
swim team captain Scott Winter.

09:28.050 --> 09:29.590
So, to put this one to rest,

09:29.650 --> 09:31.990
I went straight to the source,
Scott's penis.

09:32.050 --> 09:36.960
I just wanna know if you, like, you know...
If you... If you're, like, clean... If you...

09:37.030 --> 09:37.890
Oh!

09:38.230 --> 09:39.730
Is that what you wanna see?

09:39.800 --> 09:42.330
I can confirm
that he matched the parking lot dicks.

09:42.600 --> 09:45.600
And while I can't entirely dismiss
this strange theory,

09:45.730 --> 09:48.270
I think I may have figured out
who's clogging the showers.

09:49.910 --> 09:52.980
Not to mention,
Sara's alibi is rock-solid.

09:53.040 --> 09:57.250
She was down in San Diego with her family,
so, I'm not buying this fan theory.

09:57.310 --> 09:59.110
And that goes for most of these.

09:59.180 --> 10:00.880
They're outlandish.

10:00.950 --> 10:02.350
There may be some truth to them.

10:02.620 --> 10:05.790
Like Mr. Baxter did have access
to the security footage.

10:06.220 --> 10:07.960
The janitor does look pretty creepy.

10:08.020 --> 10:10.290
Scott Winter shaves his pubes.

10:10.660 --> 10:13.660
But there's one fan theory
that stands out from the rest.

10:13.830 --> 10:17.700
One that doesn't involve Mr. Kraz,
or the ghost of Joey Themelis.

10:21.640 --> 10:24.070
The theory is that Dylan didn't act alone.

10:24.310 --> 10:26.980
The Wayback Boys helped Dylan
plan the prank

10:27.040 --> 10:29.650
at the kegger
at Rachel Balducci's grandmother's house,

10:29.710 --> 10:31.810
known commonly as Nana's party.

10:32.180 --> 10:33.920
Multiple people said they heard it.

10:33.980 --> 10:35.880
And I have to admit,

10:35.950 --> 10:40.290
when this one started popping up,
my heart dropped, because it makes sense.

10:40.360 --> 10:43.890
Dylan was going off about the dicks
with the Wayback Boys at Nana's party.

10:43.960 --> 10:46.960
I, for sure, heard the word "dick"
at least more than once,

10:47.030 --> 10:50.200
and it seemed really strange
that a bunch of dudes

10:50.270 --> 10:52.930
were just talking about dicks
that intensely.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.100
Now looking back on it, it's pretty clear,
they were planning the vandalism.

10:56.670 --> 10:58.070
Tank Top Todd can back me up.

10:58.140 --> 11:02.080
I was chilling, Dylan
and the Wayback Boys were right there,

11:02.140 --> 11:04.350
and I overheard them talking
about the vandalism.

11:04.410 --> 11:07.680
I was only two beers deep,
so, I know it was about the dicks.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.990
You've heard
about Nana's party before.

11:10.220 --> 11:12.850
It's where Alex Trimboli claimed
to drink 11 beers.

11:12.920 --> 11:13.920
I had 11 beers.

11:13.990 --> 11:16.460
It's where Brandon
made his promposal to Gabi.

11:16.730 --> 11:18.038
Babe, will you go to prom with me?

11:19.390 --> 11:23.100
And it's where Mackenzie dumped
Dylan three days before the vandalism.

11:27.040 --> 11:30.710
Yo, Nana's party was insane.

11:30.770 --> 11:31.440
Yes!

11:32.070 --> 11:36.450
Lit as fuck, man.
There was titties, beer, a lot of candy.

11:37.080 --> 11:39.080
Dudes were dressing up in Nana's clothes.

11:39.150 --> 11:43.250
Like, mad props to Rachel for fucking
ruining her nana's house like that.

11:43.850 --> 11:46.960
'Cause we destroyed that place, dude.

11:47.020 --> 11:50.730
I just feel so bad for Rachel Balducci's
grandma, like, seriously.

11:50.790 --> 11:53.800
Her house is fucked.
It's fucked.

11:53.860 --> 11:56.300
Nana's party
was all over social media.

11:56.360 --> 11:58.770
Ari's sister brought weed from Vermont.

11:59.130 --> 12:01.100
Ryan Gould drank a fifth of vodka.

12:01.840 --> 12:04.940
Julia Perez wasn't wearing a bra.
And she shit on the floor.

12:06.210 --> 12:07.403
Everyone from school was there.

12:08.010 --> 12:09.950
Well, everyone but me and Sam.

12:10.510 --> 12:13.320
Well, Mackenzie broke up with Dylan
in front of everybody,

12:13.950 --> 12:15.450
and that really fucked his shit up.

12:15.520 --> 12:17.520
So, he met up with his homeys,

12:17.790 --> 12:21.220
and I feel like right then and there,
that's when the dicks were born.

12:21.860 --> 12:25.260
It's the Dylan-and-Mackenzie
breakup that's really concerning to me.

12:25.490 --> 12:27.830
It happened three days
before the vandalism.

12:28.830 --> 12:32.500
And we know Dylan has a history of doing
outrageous things to win Mackenzie back.

12:33.500 --> 12:36.940
So, it would make sense that
Dylan's inspiration to draw the dicks

12:37.010 --> 12:39.410
originated from the breakup
at Nana's party.

12:40.140 --> 12:42.840
To me, this isn't just another fan theory.

12:43.250 --> 12:45.280
This one could be legit.

12:45.880 --> 12:47.250
All right, I gotta take a shit.

12:48.250 --> 12:50.920
- Just use my bathroom.
- I gotta go to Priceless Moments.

12:50.990 --> 12:54.160
Now, we know the Wayback Boys
couldn't have drawn the dicks,

12:54.220 --> 12:58.030
because we have footage of them at Lucas'
house during the time of the vandalism.

12:58.090 --> 13:01.030
They could have conspired
to help Dylan by giving him an alibi.

13:02.030 --> 13:04.400
The boys all deny planning the dicks
at Nana's.

13:05.030 --> 13:07.370
But we have hundreds of videos
of the party,

13:07.440 --> 13:10.870
and if just one of them has footage
of them plotting the vandalism...

13:10.940 --> 13:13.110
well, that's pretty much it for Dylan.

13:17.010 --> 13:20.250
Tank Top Todd claims he heard
the Wayback Boys planning the prank

13:20.320 --> 13:21.550
on the couch by the stairs.

13:22.050 --> 13:24.520
From a video at 10:51 p.m.,

13:24.590 --> 13:28.160
we can see Dylan and the Wayback Boys
exactly where Todd said they were.

13:28.860 --> 13:31.060
That cell phone video
taken from the kitchen

13:31.130 --> 13:33.530
is the first evidence we have
of the conversation

13:33.600 --> 13:35.460
where they allegedly planned the dicks.

13:35.930 --> 13:39.230
And it proves
that a conversation did take place.

13:43.540 --> 13:46.170
At 10:56, they're still on the couch.

13:46.240 --> 13:48.440
Again, we can't really hear
what they're saying.

13:49.840 --> 13:51.350
- It's Ming's first beer, okay?
- No.

13:53.280 --> 13:56.020
Ming, Ming, Ming.

13:56.080 --> 13:57.850
Ming, Ming, Ming.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.990
Ming, Ming, Ming...

14:05.460 --> 14:06.490
I thought you guys...

14:08.160 --> 14:11.600
But there's enough we can do
with audio manipulation and lip-reading

14:11.870 --> 14:15.000
to make some...
Let's call them educated guesses.

14:15.070 --> 14:16.470
Ming, Ming, Ming.

14:21.110 --> 14:21.980
Yo, come on.

14:22.040 --> 14:24.280
Behind all the excitement
of Ming's first beer

14:24.350 --> 14:28.180
we can hear Spencer loudly talking
about something epic.

14:35.460 --> 14:39.130
Ten fifty-nine, from behind the couch,
they're still talking.

14:39.190 --> 14:41.130
- Come here. Come look at this.
- Hey.

14:41.560 --> 14:42.530
They're focused.

14:43.060 --> 14:45.100
It does look like
they're planning something.

14:45.170 --> 14:46.200
Nana's home!

14:48.140 --> 14:49.500
This time we're closer.

14:50.070 --> 14:53.040
We can see Dylan talking to Lucas,
Spencer, and Ganj.

14:53.310 --> 14:55.540
He says something about Tuesday.

14:55.610 --> 14:57.080
Come here. Come look at this.

14:57.150 --> 14:59.950
Tuesday, though? Okay.

15:01.080 --> 15:02.150
Nana's home!

15:02.220 --> 15:07.260
The Tuesday after Nana's party
is March 15th, the day of the vandalism.

15:07.320 --> 15:10.290
Hold up.
Are we for sure thinking Tuesday, though?

15:11.260 --> 15:13.530
Eleven-oh-two,
a few minutes later,

15:14.030 --> 15:16.000
Max Goldblum and Anthony Bianchi

15:16.060 --> 15:19.170
film Nick Cotterman trying to get
his head from out of the banister.

15:19.230 --> 15:21.300
I'm stuck. I'm fucking stuck.

15:22.370 --> 15:25.270
- Can you go get me some fucking butter?
- I'm on it. Come on.

15:27.340 --> 15:28.480
No. Fucking like that.

15:29.640 --> 15:32.380
From Max's phone,
we can see the Wayback Boys.

15:32.980 --> 15:37.350
From Anthony's phone, we can hear them.
It's brief, but it's damning.

15:37.420 --> 15:39.390
- So what, dude?
- If the cops show up,

15:39.450 --> 15:40.520
we just run, fucking run.

15:40.590 --> 15:43.160
"If the cops show up,
we just run."

15:43.960 --> 15:46.730
Eleven-oh-four,
Blake Wexler walks through the party

15:47.000 --> 15:49.460
trying to get people to kiss
for Facebook Live.

15:50.600 --> 15:53.270
Hey, guys, it's the kiss cam.
You gotta kiss.

16:02.610 --> 16:03.710
Kiss cam.

16:04.680 --> 16:06.250
Yeah. There's gotta be, like...

16:07.420 --> 16:08.580
The first one's gonna be...

16:08.650 --> 16:09.720
- Kiss cam.
- Get the fu...

16:10.550 --> 16:14.160
When he goes to Ganj and Lucas,
we can hear her for a moment.

16:15.560 --> 16:16.620
Kiss cam.

16:17.230 --> 16:18.660
- Yeah.
- Gotta be like...

16:19.290 --> 16:21.730
- The first one's gonna be fucking key...
- Kiss ca...

16:22.000 --> 16:23.600
"The first one
is going to be key."

16:24.400 --> 16:27.300
It's clear that they're still planning
something on the couch,

16:27.400 --> 16:30.510
while Pat Micklewaite talks
to Julia Perez and Allie Cabrera.

16:30.740 --> 16:34.040
Which also means that Pat Micklewaite
was invited to this party.

16:34.410 --> 16:36.540
So, good for Pat, I guess.

16:37.180 --> 16:41.650
Anyway, the last time we clock Dylan
is at 11:07 from Brad Henson's phone

16:41.720 --> 16:43.350
as he films towards the couch.

16:50.030 --> 16:50.690
I don't know.

16:50.760 --> 16:54.500
This one is tough to hear,
but what Dylan says is very important.

16:58.200 --> 16:59.630
Yeah, I hope we don't kill him.

16:59.700 --> 17:01.200
"I hope we don't kill him."

17:01.400 --> 17:03.100
I've thought about this one a lot,

17:03.170 --> 17:05.369
trying to interpret it
in a dozen different ways.

17:06.670 --> 17:11.079
But to me, the only context
that makes sense refers to Mr. Janson.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.680
As in, "I hope we don't kill him,"
the old man,

17:13.750 --> 17:15.280
by giving him a heart attack.

17:15.349 --> 17:17.619
And everything we hear
from them on the couch

17:17.690 --> 17:21.060
applies to them prepping
for the Mr. Janson prank calls.

17:21.490 --> 17:23.560
- Hey!
- Dude, epic, man. Let's do it.

17:23.630 --> 17:26.359
- Both pranks are epic.
- Come here. Come look at this.

17:26.430 --> 17:28.359
Are we for sure
thinking Tuesday, though?

17:28.430 --> 17:29.360
Yeah, we are.

17:29.430 --> 17:32.270
They both take place
on that next Tuesday.

17:32.600 --> 17:34.700
If the cops show up,
we just run. Fucking run.

17:34.770 --> 17:37.470
Both pranks are, well, illegal.

17:37.610 --> 17:39.610
And the first one's
gonna be fucking key.

17:39.670 --> 17:41.640
"The first one is key,"
that could refer

17:41.710 --> 17:43.680
to the first car or the first prank call.

17:43.750 --> 17:45.510
Shit, man,
I hope we don't kill him.

17:45.610 --> 17:47.520
But, "I hope we don't kill him"?

17:47.580 --> 17:49.620
They must be talking about Janson.

17:50.090 --> 17:51.850
I've heard him say stuff like that before.

17:52.120 --> 17:53.320
We got Janson so bad.

17:54.120 --> 17:55.760
Honestly, I'm surprised he didn't die.

17:57.560 --> 17:58.430
Yeah.

17:59.660 --> 18:02.600
I spend days searching through
the footage of Nana's party,

18:02.660 --> 18:06.230
looking for a single shot of the
Wayback Boys talking about the dicks.

18:06.500 --> 18:09.240
Just one clip
could have ended this whole thing.

18:09.870 --> 18:12.270
I didn't find the evidence
I was looking for.

18:12.810 --> 18:16.410
But the evidence I did find
could change everything.

18:20.820 --> 18:24.150
On the right is a police photo
of the spray paint can

18:24.220 --> 18:26.890
found in the staff parking lot
on the day of the vandalism.

18:27.290 --> 18:31.860
On the left is a freeze frame
from a cell phone video from Nana's party.

18:33.160 --> 18:37.300
Note the red cap
and the black label with the blue trim.

18:37.370 --> 18:41.770
I, uh... I saw all the spray-painted cars,
and so, I went looking around

18:41.840 --> 18:43.910
and I saw the spray paint can
in the trash.

18:44.170 --> 18:46.240
So, I picked it out,
gave it to the police.

18:46.310 --> 18:50.650
This brand, Crimpton,
was discontinued in 1996.

18:50.910 --> 18:54.280
Twenty years later,
it's nearly impossible to find.

18:54.680 --> 18:58.490
So, I think it's safe to say,
the can that was used to draw the dicks

18:58.550 --> 18:59.890
came from Nana's party.

19:00.920 --> 19:01.920
This is big.

19:03.830 --> 19:07.600
Hey, you've reached
Sam Ecklund, a.k.a. Ketchup Packet.

19:07.660 --> 19:09.700
Sorry I missed your call.
I'll call you back,

19:09.760 --> 19:12.330
or, you know, just text me.
It'll probably be easier.

19:12.400 --> 19:13.430
Hey, Sam, it's Peter.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.740
Um, I got evidence
that you may be interested in,

19:15.800 --> 19:17.740
so, give me a call when you get a chance.

19:17.810 --> 19:20.340
That'd be great.
I'd love to fill you in. Okay, bye.

19:21.740 --> 19:23.850
I told Sam that we had some evidence.

19:24.210 --> 19:25.650
That's a bit of an undersell.

19:25.810 --> 19:28.450
This is the Holy Grail, the murder weapon.

19:29.480 --> 19:32.820
Sam hadn't been responding to any
of my calls or texts since the argument,

19:32.890 --> 19:35.860
but he wouldn't be able
to resist seeing this new evidence.

19:35.920 --> 19:38.660
I was going through some of the footage
from Nana's party.

19:38.890 --> 19:41.260
- Yeah?
- And I found something that you're...

19:41.730 --> 19:42.930
You're gonna wanna see.

19:51.210 --> 19:52.970
Sorry things went like that the other day.

19:53.240 --> 19:55.440
Hey, don't be weird, all right?
We're good.

19:59.880 --> 20:00.980
All right, look at that.

20:04.820 --> 20:06.990
- Oh, shit, that's the same can.
- Yeah.

20:07.390 --> 20:09.590
But who's the person on the banister?

20:12.630 --> 20:13.960
Pay attention to the shirt.

20:14.830 --> 20:16.460
No way. No way.

20:16.530 --> 20:18.700
Hold on, hold on, wait, wait.
Are you serious?

20:19.330 --> 20:20.840
Oh, my good God.

20:21.270 --> 20:24.610
That is too good. That's too perfect.
He's totally the type of person...

20:29.810 --> 20:32.510
Brandon, we both know
that you're not the type of guy

20:32.850 --> 20:34.380
to do something like this.

20:34.720 --> 20:38.320
But I'm just wondering if...
Is this you in this video?

20:41.020 --> 20:43.420
- I just need the butter, please.
- Come on.

20:43.490 --> 20:44.860
- Talk to him.
- Yeah.

20:45.560 --> 20:48.730
Dude, I took a can from Nana's shed
for the promposal,

20:48.800 --> 20:52.300
but I didn't draw dicks,
or whatever you're talking about.

20:52.530 --> 20:54.840
Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no, I'm not...

20:55.940 --> 20:57.510
I'm not accusing you of that.

20:58.340 --> 20:59.910
No, I was just wondering if you...

20:59.970 --> 21:02.010
- Do you know how the cans got to school?
- No.

21:03.040 --> 21:05.050
I mean, there were other cans in the shed.

21:05.310 --> 21:08.450
This was plastic-wrapped to another can.

21:08.520 --> 21:10.650
You can check the shed
if you don't believe me.

21:17.430 --> 21:20.060
Yeah, it was pretty crazy.
Everyone bounced so fast.

21:20.560 --> 21:22.000
- Really?
- Remember the cops came?

21:23.030 --> 21:25.670
- Uh, no, we weren't there.
- Yeah.

21:26.670 --> 21:27.570
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:30.310 --> 21:31.670
Was it locked during the party?

21:32.610 --> 21:33.780
I think somebody broke it.

21:40.650 --> 21:41.520
Here.

21:41.950 --> 21:42.820
That's it.

21:44.090 --> 21:46.950
Wait, don't pick it up.
There could be fingerprints on there.

21:47.520 --> 21:49.360
All right, it's too late for that now.

21:50.090 --> 21:51.560
Fingerprints? We don't have...

21:52.590 --> 21:55.930
Here's what we know.
The spray paint can came from Nana's shed,

21:56.500 --> 21:58.700
and while we can't place Dylan
with the can,

21:58.870 --> 22:01.840
we have a video
of Brandon clearly holding it.

22:02.600 --> 22:05.510
But Brandon denies leaving
with the can.

22:05.570 --> 22:07.110
I didn't take that can home.

22:07.380 --> 22:10.680
The only thing I took home
that night was... I took Gabi home.

22:11.880 --> 22:13.080
Why don't you ask her?

22:14.820 --> 22:16.480
Yeah, no, I will. I will.

22:16.880 --> 22:19.120
He's telling the truth
about where he got the can,

22:19.390 --> 22:22.360
but doesn't mean he didn't take
the can home and draw the dicks.

22:22.420 --> 22:24.130
Sam, I get it. You hate Brandon.

22:24.560 --> 22:25.660
I don't hate Brandon.

22:26.590 --> 22:29.500
I think if he did the dicks,
he's letting it all fall on Dylan.

22:29.560 --> 22:31.500
That's pretty fucked-up of him.
That's it.

22:31.930 --> 22:33.430
I was with him, okay?

22:33.800 --> 22:37.110
He asked me to prom,
and then we went home to my house,

22:37.510 --> 22:38.770
and he didn't have the can.

22:38.970 --> 22:41.910
And on the day of the vandalism,
we were also at my house.

22:43.580 --> 22:47.580
So, if Brandon didn't leave the party
with the can, who did?

22:48.450 --> 22:50.650
Pretty much what I did
is I took all the footage

22:50.720 --> 22:52.620
from Nana's party that was time-stamped,

22:52.690 --> 22:54.790
- and I created a timeline using it.
- Okay.

22:54.860 --> 22:56.890
I used that same footage
to create a timeline

22:56.960 --> 22:59.090
of the journey of the can
throughout the party.

22:59.990 --> 23:03.730
There are a few holes in both timelines,
but the entire night is accounted for.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.930
Awesome.
When's the first time we clock the can?

23:06.470 --> 23:08.900
Um, at 11:02
when Brandon goes into the shed.

23:10.970 --> 23:12.010
It's right here.

23:12.770 --> 23:15.440
As John Harrahan plays guitar
on the patio,

23:15.610 --> 23:17.650
we clock Brandon breaking into the shed.

23:20.650 --> 23:23.080
The next time
we see the can is on the stairs.

23:23.680 --> 23:26.990
Presumably, he's coming back
from the master bathroom,

23:27.050 --> 23:29.090
where he grabbed one of Nana's towels.

23:31.630 --> 23:33.760
He goes outside to spray-paint the towel.

23:33.930 --> 23:37.930
Bro, I think Gabi is expecting
one of those fucking lame promposals.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.700
What you got?
What are you gonna do?

23:39.770 --> 23:41.640
- I'll show you what I'm gonna do.
- What?

23:41.700 --> 23:43.100
- I'll show you.
- All right, what?

23:44.910 --> 23:47.180
This video
is time-stamped at 11:10.

23:47.440 --> 23:48.740
- Okay, hold on.
- All right.

23:53.050 --> 23:55.450
- Yeah. It's hot.
- Technical difficulties.

23:55.520 --> 23:57.450
- One moment, please.
- She's gonna love it.

23:58.190 --> 23:59.650
Ah!

24:01.920 --> 24:03.960
Gabi. I or Y?

24:05.060 --> 24:08.600
- It's an I, you fucking idiot.
- I know how to spell my girlfriend's name.

24:08.660 --> 24:10.122
- Do you? Okay.
- I'm fucking with you.

24:11.930 --> 24:12.800
That's a master...

24:12.870 --> 24:15.100
- He tosses the can.
- That's how you win prom king.

24:15.640 --> 24:17.670
And it lands
in the bushes behind him.

24:18.640 --> 24:22.540
All right, everybody.
Hottest Nanas 2016 right here.

24:22.610 --> 24:23.610
Competition right now.

24:23.680 --> 24:26.850
For the next 30 minutes,
Mike Bertha, James Snyder

24:26.910 --> 24:29.750
and Chris McFarland parade around
in Nana's clothes

24:29.850 --> 24:31.720
for the Hottest Nana competition.

24:32.050 --> 24:35.760
We see the can is still in the bushes here
at 11:35.

24:37.160 --> 24:42.160
It's still there at 11:41,
and we catch another glimpse at 11:52.

24:46.200 --> 24:47.670
Just seven minutes later...

24:48.670 --> 24:50.710
This is Ming's ninth beer!

24:50.970 --> 24:52.910
- Come on, Ming!
- Ming! Ming! Ming!

24:52.970 --> 24:54.810
- You got it, bud.
- Ming! Ming! Ming!

24:54.880 --> 24:57.510
- Ming! Ming! Ming!
- Oh, shit.

24:57.580 --> 24:58.850
Yo.

25:00.110 --> 25:04.050
As Ming funnels another beer,
Julia Perez notices the can...

25:04.120 --> 25:05.950
- No way.
- Yeah!

25:08.920 --> 25:10.660
...and brings it into the gazebo.

25:12.230 --> 25:14.900
The can stays on the bar
for only three minutes

25:15.130 --> 25:17.700
as Julia uses it
to crush up some Adderall.

25:18.700 --> 25:19.930
You think you're gonna puke?

25:20.100 --> 25:22.240
Alex Trimboli. Look.

25:23.540 --> 25:25.940
Dude, I'm fucked up, man. It's crazy.

25:26.940 --> 25:29.280
- This your first time?
- Yeah.

25:29.640 --> 25:32.710
First time you're...
Yeah. Dude, it's fucked up the first time.

25:34.680 --> 25:36.880
Isn't that the same beer
he was drinking earlier?

25:38.050 --> 25:39.920
- How do you know?
- Look at the label.

25:41.620 --> 25:42.960
Come over here!

25:43.020 --> 25:43.890
Wait, let me try.

25:45.190 --> 25:47.060
Well, she took it down to the barbecue.

25:47.760 --> 25:49.700
- Dude, that is the same label.
- It is?

25:50.130 --> 25:51.000
Same exact beer.

25:51.200 --> 25:53.270
If that really is his first beer,

25:53.700 --> 25:58.040
it's another example of the school board's
key witness lying for attention.

25:58.110 --> 26:01.310
The most drunk anyone at our high school's
ever been in their life.

26:05.880 --> 26:09.650
At 12:04,
Matt Zordich tries spraying Carl Wolf.

26:13.120 --> 26:14.190
Nothing comes out.

26:15.060 --> 26:18.690
- You're lucky the can won't spray.
- So, he places it on this column.

26:23.200 --> 26:26.730
Rachel Balducci...
best party ever, man.

26:26.800 --> 26:31.770
It's still there 30 minutes later
when Jimmy Arizini toasts Rachel Balducci.

26:36.810 --> 26:38.310
Oh, shit, the cops are here.

26:39.280 --> 26:40.720
Fuck the police!

26:40.780 --> 26:45.220
At 1 a.m. the cops come,
break up the party, and it's gone.

26:46.220 --> 26:52.060
So, someone who was in Nana's backyard
between 12:41 and 1:02 a.m. took the can.

26:52.690 --> 26:54.730
And it's likely that, three days later,

26:54.800 --> 27:00.700
that same someone drew 27 dicks
on 27 cars in the staff parking lot.

27:02.370 --> 27:04.040
As the school year winds down

27:04.110 --> 27:06.810
and Dylan Maxwell's
criminal hearing approaches,

27:06.910 --> 27:11.050
the videos from Nana's party allowed us
to narrow our pool of suspects.

27:11.780 --> 27:15.980
More importantly,
it led Sam to our biggest theory yet.

27:16.920 --> 27:18.390
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.

27:19.090 --> 27:21.090
- How are you?
- Good.

27:22.260 --> 27:23.960
- Here you go.
- Thank you very much.

27:26.330 --> 27:31.270
Um... Okay. Can you hold this for me
right there on that corner?

27:32.330 --> 27:34.240
Right there. Splatter, right there.

27:35.740 --> 27:37.140
- Yeah, that is splatter.
- Yeah.

27:37.200 --> 27:39.070
Okay. So, you know how in the videos,

27:39.140 --> 27:41.280
everyone has a super hard time
using the can?

27:41.340 --> 27:42.810
They have to shake 20 times?

27:42.880 --> 27:44.250
- Yeah?
- Because the can's old.

27:44.310 --> 27:45.780
It's, like, 1993.

27:45.850 --> 27:48.320
- They stopped making it in '96.
- Let me see the towel.

27:48.380 --> 27:50.020
Stopped selling it the same year.

27:54.720 --> 27:57.190
Using the identical can
we borrowed from Nana's shed,

27:57.290 --> 27:58.930
we ran a ballistics test.

27:59.930 --> 28:01.300
And Sam's theory was right.

28:02.930 --> 28:05.330
Nothing comes out.
That's me pressing as hard as I can.

28:05.400 --> 28:06.270
Go ahead, try.

28:09.370 --> 28:11.140
- Ditto.
- Nothing comes out, right?

28:11.210 --> 28:13.310
Every time the can sat
for more than ten minutes,

28:13.370 --> 28:15.010
we had to shake it again.

28:15.440 --> 28:17.750
And if the can wasn't primed,
it splattered.

28:18.250 --> 28:23.120
Which means the first car vandalized
on March 15th would have splatter on it.

28:23.280 --> 28:25.850
Here, look,
you can see it perfectly in the video.

28:30.160 --> 28:32.490
- See, right here he's shaking the can.
- There you go.

28:36.200 --> 28:37.830
That's what I'm talking about.

28:38.900 --> 28:41.140
Right there.
Right there you can see the splatter.

28:41.470 --> 28:43.270
- Yeah, that's splatter.
- You see?

28:44.210 --> 28:46.510
So, the first car hit
would have splatter.

28:47.370 --> 28:49.810
Take a look at the dick
on Ms. Shapiro's car.

28:50.750 --> 28:54.180
All of the lines, the shaft, the balls,
they're clean.

28:54.420 --> 28:55.420
No splatter.

28:55.980 --> 28:58.050
Her car couldn't have been
the first one hit.

28:58.890 --> 29:01.460
Mr. Maxwell targeted my vehicle.

29:02.090 --> 29:04.430
It makes logical sense.

29:04.490 --> 29:08.500
If you have a vendetta against someone,
and a limited amount of time,

29:08.760 --> 29:10.830
wouldn't you strike your target first?

29:11.270 --> 29:13.430
But maybe Shapiro
wasn't entirely wrong.

29:14.440 --> 29:18.470
Is it possible the first vehicle hit
could be the vandal's target?

29:19.340 --> 29:24.040
By identifying the car with splatter,
we'll hopefully identify the true victim,

29:24.110 --> 29:26.980
and from that,
we can unearth who drew the dicks.

29:28.180 --> 29:29.420
This is our best lead yet,

29:29.480 --> 29:33.250
and it leaves me wondering,
if Shapiro wasn't the target...

29:34.090 --> 29:35.020
then who was?

29:36.305 --> 29:42.861
