11:04.430 --> 11:05.798
We have Omarosa,

11:05.798 --> 11:09.502
a brown-nosing reality
TV star from The Apprentice.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.205
She worked for Trump
until she was fired.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.373
Let me be Omarosa.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.275
Are we typecasting this?

11:15.275 --> 11:17.310
[all laugh]

11:17.310 --> 11:19.779
[Ra'Jah] I'm super excited
with the role of Omarosa

11:19.779 --> 11:22.015
because I see
a lot of myself in her.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.583
Although she's seen as a bitch,

11:23.583 --> 11:26.819
she most definitely owns
every room that she walks into.

11:26.819 --> 11:29.088
I think that we haven't done
a Kellyanne, right?

11:29.088 --> 11:31.291
Kellyanne Conway, tired, blonde,

11:31.291 --> 11:33.459
haggard press spokesperson
for Trump.

11:33.459 --> 11:36.863
Oh, you'd be
a sickening Kellyanne.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.097
[Ra'Jah] Yvie looks like
the crypt-keeper,

11:38.097 --> 11:40.767
so she had to be
Kellyanne Conway.

11:40.767 --> 11:42.769
[Scarlet] Mercedes,
so you're Trump's daughter.

11:42.769 --> 11:43.770
You're Ivanka, okay?

11:45.939 --> 11:47.807
I have no idea about anything
about Ivanka Trump.

11:47.807 --> 11:50.276
God, this is bad

11:50.276 --> 11:52.445
that I don't know
half of these people.

11:52.445 --> 11:56.049
I should have done a lot of
research before I got here.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.517
I didn't.

11:57.517 --> 12:00.787
And then there's the teen angel,
which is Oprah.

12:00.787 --> 12:02.488
Yeah.
[all laugh]

12:02.488 --> 12:04.624
I mean, I think that obviously--

12:04.624 --> 12:06.225
-[Yvie] Oprah.
-[Scarlet] Oprah, right?

12:06.225 --> 12:07.594
I think
that's a good move, yeah.

12:07.594 --> 12:09.696
I wouldn't mind taking Shandee.

12:09.696 --> 12:11.097
I think you should be Oprah,
girl.

12:11.097 --> 12:12.665
[Silky] That is just so obvious.

12:12.665 --> 12:14.300
Why do I have to be Oprah?

12:14.300 --> 12:16.869
Like I've kind of been in the
back this entire competition.

12:16.869 --> 12:19.272
Like, I'm always
being typecast, like--

12:19.272 --> 12:21.608
It's not typecasting.
It's fierce.

12:21.608 --> 12:22.809
So let's go ahead
and make you Oprah.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.211
That bitch still gave me Oprah.

12:25.211 --> 12:28.881
Oprah has 40 seconds
in this entire role.

12:28.881 --> 12:30.817
I want the main character.

12:30.817 --> 12:34.053
Why I'm Oprah?

12:34.053 --> 12:37.190
After that six-way gangbang
last week,

12:37.190 --> 12:38.491
if we don't slay this rusical,

12:38.491 --> 12:41.594
we could possibly be
witnessing a 12-way lip sync.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.830
Stay tuned.

12:43.830 --> 12:46.799
♪ Trump High's the worst,
it's the worst ♪

12:46.799 --> 12:49.636
♪ Just the worst ♪

12:49.636 --> 12:51.237
[Shuga Cain]
This week's Maxi Challenge

12:51.237 --> 12:55.174
is a lip sync extravaganza,
Trump! The Rusical!, honey.

12:55.174 --> 12:57.577
This is so good.
"The future is female."

12:57.577 --> 13:00.780
It's literally on my...jacket.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.649
[Nina] This challenge
is tough, right,

13:02.649 --> 13:03.650
because you have
to get into character

13:03.650 --> 13:06.219
and kind of find
our acting ability.

13:06.219 --> 13:07.553
I'm Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

13:07.553 --> 13:09.088
I'm here to give you
the briefings.

13:09.088 --> 13:10.923
I'm channeling
my inner Meryl Streep.

13:10.923 --> 13:12.925
I'm like, hey,
"not without my daughter."

13:12.925 --> 13:14.827
Oh, that was Sally Field.

13:14.827 --> 13:16.229
[laughs]

13:16.229 --> 13:18.898
So I'm also channeling
my inner Sally Field.

13:18.898 --> 13:21.067
[Brooke Lynn] I'm kind of
drawing inspiration

13:21.067 --> 13:22.568
for my character,
obviously from Ivana,

13:22.568 --> 13:23.970
but a little bit from
Patsy Stone from Ab Fab.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.004
[Ariel]
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:25.004 --> 13:26.572
Very like...

13:26.572 --> 13:29.709
I get Ivana Trump,
who's exactly who I wanted.

13:29.709 --> 13:34.681
She just is like a plastic
surgery dream boat, like this.

13:34.681 --> 13:37.717
Just puffed and very bitchy.

13:37.717 --> 13:38.718
Which I like.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.355
Hey, kitty girls.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.791
-Hi.
-Hi.

13:44.791 --> 13:46.359
Are you feeling complicit?

13:46.359 --> 13:47.927
Yes, honey.
[all laugh]

13:47.927 --> 13:49.362
[Silky] This bitch is shaking.

13:49.362 --> 13:51.264
-Hi, ladies.
-Hi, Ru.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.833
Brooke Lynn, of course, there's
a lot of choreography here.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.802
They know you are a dancer.

13:55.802 --> 13:57.837
-I am.
-Are you a private dancer?

13:57.837 --> 13:59.272
I can be for the right amount.

13:59.272 --> 14:00.840
Exactly.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.875
I was a professional
ballet dancer for six years,

14:02.875 --> 14:05.011
so I'm ready to have a good time
with this challenge.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.879
You'll be fine.
What about the other girls?

14:06.879 --> 14:08.481
Well, I think
this one will be fine.

14:08.481 --> 14:09.916
She's a Texas Bucket queen.

14:09.916 --> 14:11.350
[Ariel] I have a musical theater
background,

14:11.350 --> 14:13.519
so I kind of have to
force myself, obviously,

14:13.519 --> 14:14.721
to pick up choreography.

14:14.721 --> 14:16.089
I don't really dance,

14:16.089 --> 14:18.224
but I have a cocktail in my hand
the entire time.

14:18.224 --> 14:20.126
-I love that.
-Lucky you.

14:20.126 --> 14:21.961
Well, listen,
a lot of lip syncing,

14:21.961 --> 14:24.163
a lot of preplanning
for you all.

14:24.163 --> 14:26.666
So I cannot wait
to see what you can do.

14:26.666 --> 14:28.000
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you, Ru.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.702
Bye.

14:29.702 --> 14:32.405
[Ru] Well, hello,
Prance-Suit Nation.

14:32.405 --> 14:33.506
Hi, Mama Ru.

14:33.506 --> 14:34.941
Is it anything like
the Rhythm Nation?

14:34.941 --> 14:38.177
[all laugh]

14:38.177 --> 14:42.849
[Ru] Now, this is
a politically-minded challenge.

14:42.849 --> 14:45.218
Are you registered to vote,
Dr. Ganache?

14:45.218 --> 14:46.686
I'm actually
a registered Republican.

14:51.290 --> 14:53.359
Girl, you're a Republican?
Bitch, bye.

14:53.359 --> 14:55.762
I'm a Republican
because of gentrification

14:55.762 --> 14:57.997
and re-movement of,
you know, the districts,

14:57.997 --> 15:00.166
it's very important
that people realize

15:00.166 --> 15:02.402
that if you want to stop that
within the political process,

15:02.402 --> 15:04.070
get smarter than them.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.571
-Register as a Republican.
-Yeah.

15:05.571 --> 15:07.140
And they don't have
to redo everything.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.375
Just because
I am a registered Republican

15:09.375 --> 15:12.545
doesn't mean that
I actually vote Republican.

15:12.545 --> 15:15.114
Bitch, I ain't never
voted for Trump.

15:15.114 --> 15:18.317
So you have a strategy to
infiltrate the Republican party

15:18.317 --> 15:20.953
and circumvent
their gerrymandering.

15:20.953 --> 15:22.054
Absolutely.

15:22.054 --> 15:24.056
That will help you
a lot in this challenge.

15:24.056 --> 15:26.692
[all laugh]

15:26.692 --> 15:28.261
And what role do you have,
Shuga?

15:28.261 --> 15:29.629
I am Miss Hillary Clinton.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.330
[Ru] What role did you get,
A'Keria?

15:31.330 --> 15:33.900
I'm actually Stormy Daniels,
the sex kitten.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.768
What role
did you get, Vanjie?

15:35.768 --> 15:37.403
I'm Miss Rosie O'Donnell.

15:37.403 --> 15:38.404
[RuPaul] All right, listen.

15:38.404 --> 15:40.306
This is another
lip sync challenge,

15:40.306 --> 15:44.210
and this is really crucial
that you get it right.

15:44.210 --> 15:46.112
All right,
I'll see you all later.

15:46.112 --> 15:48.247
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Ru.

15:48.247 --> 15:50.082
I'll be serving
like very attitude--

15:50.082 --> 15:52.285
-Hello.
-Hey, Ru.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.586
Are you all The Foxy Ladies?

15:53.586 --> 15:54.687
Yes, we are.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.923
Nina, are you
politically minded?

15:56.923 --> 15:58.124
I am. I grew up
in a really political family.

15:58.124 --> 15:59.525
-Really?
-Yeah.

15:59.525 --> 16:02.261
At the age of 12, I went to the
Republican National Convention.

16:02.261 --> 16:04.964
You did?
Did your party win that year?

16:04.964 --> 16:07.300
Well, it's not my party, but
I believe they did win, yeah.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.467
I believe it was George Bush.

16:08.467 --> 16:09.535
The first George.

16:09.535 --> 16:10.937
The first George,
yeah, the father.

16:10.937 --> 16:13.906
I met Barbara Bush
and I met Connie Chung.

16:13.906 --> 16:15.875
I come from
a very Republican family.

16:15.875 --> 16:18.110
I was the president
of the Young Republican Club.

16:18.110 --> 16:19.779
Then I started to realize
I was gay.

16:19.779 --> 16:22.148
So now I'm super liberal
and super progressive.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.450
And Mercedes,
you're playing who?

16:24.450 --> 16:27.987
Well, we went through, um...

16:30.089 --> 16:32.859
Come here and let me slap you.
[all laugh]

16:32.859 --> 16:34.360
Maybe I'll slap
some sense into you.

16:34.360 --> 16:36.128
What language do you speak?

16:36.128 --> 16:38.431
-Swahili. Yeah.
-Swahili.

16:38.431 --> 16:41.601
Well, how do you say, "Bitch,
you better wake up" in Swahili?

16:41.601 --> 16:43.169
[all laugh]

16:43.169 --> 16:44.337
[speaking Swahili]

16:44.337 --> 16:47.440
[repeats]...bitch

16:47.440 --> 16:50.209
-You got it.
-Yes.

16:50.209 --> 16:51.677
I'm playing Ivanka Trump.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.880
Do you have any
of her mannerisms?

16:53.880 --> 16:57.350
You know what? I... don't.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.517
But I'm gonna make it work.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.887
[RuPaul] Okay, well, we'll see.

17:00.887 --> 17:02.388
I don't know nothing
about the Trump family,

17:02.388 --> 17:04.590
but I'm gonna do
what I have to do.

17:04.590 --> 17:08.194
Bitch, I'm gonna show Mama Ru
I am the GOAT.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.596
Meaning: Greatest Of All Time.

17:10.596 --> 17:11.597
[goat bleats]

17:11.597 --> 17:12.698
[RuPaul] All right.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.500
Ra'Jah, are you any good
at choreography?

17:14.500 --> 17:16.569
I am technically trained
as a dancer,

17:16.569 --> 17:17.770
so I think
picking up the choreography

17:17.770 --> 17:19.305
for me will be easy.

17:19.305 --> 17:22.708
And then even if I need to help,
you know, some of my girls out

17:22.708 --> 17:24.477
with their two left feet
or three.

17:24.477 --> 17:25.845
[all laugh]

17:25.845 --> 17:28.581
Well, let's hope that
you can help your girls out

17:28.581 --> 17:30.216
more than you helped
the other girls out

17:30.216 --> 17:32.051
with the Mariah challenge.

17:32.051 --> 17:35.021
First dig.
Here we go again.

17:35.021 --> 17:38.491
Girl, can we not just leave
the past in the past?

17:38.491 --> 17:39.492
[RuPaul]
This is an important one,

17:39.492 --> 17:42.161
because the gangbang lip sync

17:42.161 --> 17:44.530
was a wakeup call for everybody.

17:44.530 --> 17:46.766
All eyes are on you, you know.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.000
-Thank you, Ru.
-Thank you.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.001
All right.

17:49.001 --> 17:51.037
Girl.

17:51.037 --> 17:52.038
All right, ladies, listen up.

17:52.038 --> 17:53.839
Now, in a few minutes,

17:53.839 --> 17:57.209
you'll meet with
the fantastique choreographer

17:57.209 --> 17:58.311
Yanis Marshall.

17:58.311 --> 18:01.347
[cheers]
Oh, my God!

18:01.347 --> 18:03.449
Heels, heels.

18:05.384 --> 18:07.753
[Nina] If you don't know Yanis,
he's Deadpool,

18:07.753 --> 18:09.322
in the Celine Dion
Deadpool video.

18:09.322 --> 18:12.692
He's known for being in heels
and being sassy.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.293
[Shuga Cain] I'm excited
and a little nervous,

18:14.293 --> 18:15.528
'cause I know he don't play.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.730
And I'm just anticipating

18:17.730 --> 18:19.999
what kind of crazy shit
we're about to do, girl.

18:19.999 --> 18:23.402
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.207
[Vanjie] Now it's time
to learn this choreography

18:28.207 --> 18:29.408
from Mr. Yanis.

18:29.408 --> 18:31.444
He's standing there
fiercely in heels

18:31.444 --> 18:34.347
feeling her fantasy,
about to fierce the house down.

18:34.347 --> 18:36.315
This about to be very extra

18:36.315 --> 18:38.017
Hi, ladies.

18:38.017 --> 18:39.385
[all] Hi.

18:39.385 --> 18:41.087
[Yanis]
We have a lot to learn today.

18:41.087 --> 18:42.788
And we are kind of looking

18:42.788 --> 18:45.825
of something like
Beyoncé meets Grease.

18:45.825 --> 18:46.959
[Vanjie] Come on, Beyoncé.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.995
Oh, that's all you heard
is Beyoncé.

18:48.995 --> 18:51.230
[Vanjie] And Grease and Grease
and Grease.

18:51.230 --> 18:54.433
Obviously I'm going to put a lot
of dance into this challenge.

18:54.433 --> 18:58.037
I would love to know if you have
a dance background or anything.

18:58.037 --> 19:01.607
I can't dance, but I've been
with plenty of dancers.

19:01.607 --> 19:03.743
[all laugh]
Okay.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.511
I do have a dance background.

19:05.511 --> 19:10.116
Ballet, modern dance,
jazz, tap, African.

19:10.116 --> 19:11.317
Ooh, all that.

19:11.317 --> 19:12.418
Whatever you ask,
whatever you need.

19:12.418 --> 19:14.153
Whatever I need? Okay.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.955
I used to be a professional
ballet dancer.

19:15.955 --> 19:17.623
-Oh.
-French training.

19:17.623 --> 19:20.026
Can you show me
a few ballet moves?

19:22.094 --> 19:23.262
-Yes!
-Okay.

19:23.262 --> 19:26.532
Oh. All right, now that
was a nice battement.

19:26.532 --> 19:29.135
Oh, arabesque.
Okay, we like it.

19:29.135 --> 19:32.571
[Ra'jah] So we doing
demonstrations now?

19:32.571 --> 19:34.040
[Yanis] All right,
so let's start.

19:34.040 --> 19:36.742
Can I have The Foxy Ladies?

19:36.742 --> 19:38.544
Let me show you first.

19:43.582 --> 19:47.386
♪ Trump High's the worst
it's absurd, spread the word ♪

19:50.556 --> 19:51.924
Fuck. I'm shaking
in my boots.

19:51.924 --> 19:55.294
This choreography
is like professional.

19:55.294 --> 19:56.595
This is about to be
real technical.

19:56.595 --> 19:58.130
It's not gonna be no one-two.

19:58.130 --> 20:00.800
Well, Yvie, can you let me see
your version of it?

20:00.800 --> 20:03.469
Turn, down, hold.

20:03.469 --> 20:06.172
Shimmy and touch and talk.

20:06.172 --> 20:08.307
Yeah, I actually like that.
I love the attitude.

20:08.307 --> 20:10.076
Ra'Jah, can I see that from you?

20:11.110 --> 20:13.712
Right, left, drop, open, turn.

20:13.712 --> 20:15.347
Oh, I'm sorry.

20:15.347 --> 20:19.919
[Yanis]
Drop, open, turn, shimmy.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.887
-Oop. I'm sorry.
-Uh-huh.

20:21.887 --> 20:25.191
[Yanis] Where did that
dance experience go?

20:25.191 --> 20:28.694
I actually danced,
technically, 15 years ago, so...

20:28.694 --> 20:29.695
Oh.

20:29.695 --> 20:31.597
Girl, 15 years ago.

20:31.597 --> 20:33.899
All right, you work on that.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.901
Can I see the Trump wives?

20:35.901 --> 20:38.671
It's all about
your body positions, right?

20:38.671 --> 20:39.939
You want to be hot.

20:39.939 --> 20:42.441
So this is hot.
This is not hot.

20:42.441 --> 20:44.443
Hot. Yes.

20:44.443 --> 20:46.112
-Can I see you do it?
-Yeah.

20:46.112 --> 20:47.279
So everybody watch Brooke Lynn.

20:47.279 --> 20:49.381
Sit, look, click.

20:49.381 --> 20:51.016
Click. And switch.

20:51.016 --> 20:53.552
Snap. Uh. Left, right.

20:53.552 --> 20:55.921
That was hot.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.390
All right, Betsy DeVos,
your turn.

20:58.390 --> 21:02.027
Sit, look, shoulder, shoulder.

21:02.027 --> 21:05.364
Huh, switch, uh, snap, snap.

21:05.364 --> 21:06.966
Ooh.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.300
[all laugh]

21:08.300 --> 21:11.003
[Yvie] Scarlet looks like

21:11.003 --> 21:13.706
a stick bug in a hurricane,
girl.

21:13.706 --> 21:15.407
[laughs]

21:15.407 --> 21:17.943
[Yanis]
Sit, look. Oh, my God.

21:17.943 --> 21:19.545
[all laugh]

21:19.545 --> 21:23.382
You just gave me, like,
3 A.M. Last call.

21:23.382 --> 21:25.151
I need another drink.

21:25.151 --> 21:28.154
Okay, can we have
the Prance-Suit Nation

21:28.154 --> 21:29.822
and Oprah please now.

21:29.822 --> 21:30.890
[Vanjie]
The prancing elites.

21:30.890 --> 21:32.725
So let me teach you another set.

21:32.725 --> 21:36.562
And sit and across, arms.

21:36.562 --> 21:38.831
So it's fast.
Yes, seven.

21:38.831 --> 21:39.965
You have a count for that?

21:39.965 --> 21:41.901
No, it's going to be
on the lyrics.

21:41.901 --> 21:44.436
It's the worst,
it's the worst--

21:44.436 --> 21:46.372
So this on one?

21:46.372 --> 21:47.907
It's the worst.
It's not a one.

21:47.907 --> 21:50.543
If you would just give me a one.

21:50.543 --> 21:51.977
[all laugh]

21:51.977 --> 21:54.346
Welcome to show biz.
You have to be fast.

21:54.346 --> 21:56.015
-All right.
-A'Keria, let me see.

21:56.015 --> 21:58.751
It's the worst,
it's the worst.

22:00.686 --> 22:02.888
-It is the worst.
-Oh!

22:02.888 --> 22:04.490
[all laugh]
Shade.

22:04.490 --> 22:05.524
Can we try something else?

22:05.524 --> 22:07.660
Okay. So watch.

22:07.660 --> 22:11.096
You're gonna go
from left to right, okay?

22:11.096 --> 22:16.001
Now, as you do this,
you're starting to go down here,

22:16.001 --> 22:18.437
and then sit.

22:18.437 --> 22:20.472
Okay, by the sound of it,

22:20.472 --> 22:21.907
I can already tell
that's not it.

22:21.907 --> 22:23.943
I'm just a little worried
about hitting my knees,

22:23.943 --> 22:26.278
'cause they
come out of place a lot.

22:26.278 --> 22:27.880
What do you mean
they come out of place?

22:27.880 --> 22:29.114
They just pop out?

22:29.114 --> 22:30.182
Yeah, it's part of my disease
I got, girl.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.617
All of my shit pops out.

22:31.617 --> 22:33.986
What is it that you have?
What's your issue?

22:33.986 --> 22:36.155
Uh, I have
a connective tissue disorder

22:36.155 --> 22:39.258
where all of my joints are,
while they're flexible,

22:39.258 --> 22:42.428
all of them pops out of place
if I hit the ground too hard.

22:42.428 --> 22:44.230
So I'm going to try to be soft.

22:44.230 --> 22:45.965
Of course, yeah.
Thank you for telling me.

22:45.965 --> 22:49.168
And, yeah, you should always
be careful with your body.

22:49.168 --> 22:52.137
I have a disease called
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type 3.

22:52.137 --> 22:54.340
I don't produce
a whole lot of collagen,

22:54.340 --> 22:58.143
so I have extra skin,
like everywhere.

22:58.143 --> 23:02.147
And I'm prone to dislocating
my knees and things like that,

23:02.147 --> 23:04.850
but it's not going to hold me
back in this competition.

23:04.850 --> 23:08.220
[Yanis] And breathe, and down.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.922
That's nice.
Ra'Jah, let me see.

23:09.922 --> 23:13.025
-And up, one.
-Ooh, I'm sorry.

23:13.025 --> 23:14.927
Keep the space, honey.
Keep the space, yes.

23:14.927 --> 23:15.928
Which way does the--

23:15.928 --> 23:16.929
This way, honey, this way, left.

23:16.929 --> 23:18.330
Give me drama.

23:18.330 --> 23:20.065
Five, six, seven,

23:20.065 --> 23:25.037
up, one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

23:25.037 --> 23:30.042
Open, one, two,
three, four, ooh.

23:30.042 --> 23:31.243
Ra'Jah, you shouldn't
have told me

23:31.243 --> 23:32.611
you had all this
dance experience, mama,

23:32.611 --> 23:35.214
because now I'm expecting
so much of you.

23:35.214 --> 23:38.550
[A'Keria] Omarosa,
she's ready to cut Yanis.

23:38.550 --> 23:43.389
Girl, please don't slap
that man, Miss Ra'Jah.

23:43.389 --> 23:45.457
Don't do it, Missy.

23:45.457 --> 23:48.027
[Yanis] Don't look down.
I want you to be alive.

23:48.027 --> 23:51.697
This was very, "I'm thinking,"
looking down.

23:51.697 --> 23:54.366
[Ra'Jah] Yanis is giving me
the fucking blues,

23:54.366 --> 23:56.068
and I'm not taking it.

23:56.068 --> 23:57.670
I'm not having it,
I'm not liking it,

23:57.670 --> 23:59.905
I'm not featuring it,
any of it.

23:59.905 --> 24:02.174
Imagine doing this
and lip syncing. Good luck.

24:02.174 --> 24:04.410
[Ra'jah] Yanis, aah!

24:04.410 --> 24:06.512
And he say--ooh.

24:08.180 --> 24:10.683
Lord, give me strength.

24:10.683 --> 24:11.717
Okay. Can we move on?

24:12.885 --> 24:17.389
Six, seven, eight,
up and down.

24:17.389 --> 24:19.058
Oh, Shandee,

24:19.058 --> 24:22.127
you're going to have
a lot to do in this rusical,

24:22.127 --> 24:23.962
so you're going to really
have to stay focused.

24:23.962 --> 24:25.631
[Ariel] I'm playing
the lead role,

24:25.631 --> 24:26.765
and I just know that
I'm not going to be able

24:26.765 --> 24:27.800
to pull this move off.

24:27.800 --> 24:30.235
Up, five, six, on the seven,

24:30.235 --> 24:31.603
eight, open, one.

24:31.603 --> 24:33.172
-Girl, don't lose your heel.
-I know.

24:33.172 --> 24:35.641
Oh, my God.
Shandee, keep it together.

24:35.641 --> 24:37.276
Put your heels-- [laughs]

24:37.276 --> 24:38.711
[Ariel] When I walked in,

24:38.711 --> 24:40.746
I was thinking like this
was going to be super fun.

24:40.746 --> 24:42.281
I did not expect it to be

24:42.281 --> 24:45.417
like we're doing the frickin'
Beyoncé halftime concert.

24:45.417 --> 24:49.688
Three, down, up, under...

24:49.688 --> 24:52.324
stretch, and sit.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.860
[Yanis] I'm worried
about Ariel the most.

24:54.860 --> 24:57.262
I don't see the star
in her right now.

24:57.262 --> 24:58.797
Everybody, last time.

24:58.797 --> 25:00.499
Five, six, seven,

25:00.499 --> 25:04.803
and breathe and down.

25:04.803 --> 25:06.171
[Scarlet] Girl.

25:11.877 --> 25:13.178
Everyone's just telling me
to do it,

25:13.178 --> 25:14.780
and I just--I look so stupid.

25:14.780 --> 25:18.751
And now I'm gonna be that girl
that can't get the choreography.

25:18.751 --> 25:20.519
I have to really
get it together

25:20.519 --> 25:22.488
or I'm really gonna bomb
this challenge.

25:27.159 --> 25:28.193
Ha!

25:28.193 --> 25:30.329
Whoo, another week, hey!

25:30.329 --> 25:33.031
-It is show day, bitch.
-I know, right?

25:33.031 --> 25:34.400
[Shuga Cain]
Today is elimination day,

25:34.400 --> 25:37.269
and we are about to perform
Trump! The Rusical!

25:38.370 --> 25:39.405
Oh, sis.

25:39.405 --> 25:41.740
How you feeling?

25:41.740 --> 25:46.478
I was just freaking myself out
like the psycho I am, so...

25:46.478 --> 25:51.116
I had my little breakdown,
but I practiced my ass off.

25:51.116 --> 25:54.052
I just hope that I can pull
my weight in this challenge,

25:54.052 --> 25:56.622
because I have the lead role,
so I need to kill it.

25:58.824 --> 26:00.859
Girl, this is the first time
I've saw you with no brows.

26:00.859 --> 26:02.394
I didn't have no time, girl.
I got out that shower, girl,

26:02.394 --> 26:04.329
I said, girl,
no eyebrows today.

26:04.329 --> 26:05.898
You need a permanent marker?

26:05.898 --> 26:07.332
No, bitch.
Is that what you use?

26:07.332 --> 26:08.634
That's what I use. It's like
my old faithful, honey.

26:08.634 --> 26:10.736
It works.

26:10.736 --> 26:13.772
Silky puts her brows on
with a Sharpie.

26:13.772 --> 26:15.107
Like, what?

26:15.107 --> 26:17.042
They're $2.00, honey.

26:17.042 --> 26:18.644
Silky gets her makeup
from Office Depot.

26:18.644 --> 26:20.179
Like, that's crazy to me.

26:21.947 --> 26:23.782
[Nina] I'm loving that
it's a political challenge.

26:23.782 --> 26:25.717
Can I just say
that I really wish

26:25.717 --> 26:28.520
the country would get back
to how it was when Obama ran?

26:28.520 --> 26:29.988
About the idea of hope.

26:29.988 --> 26:32.291
I want people
to have equal access.

26:32.291 --> 26:33.525
I want people to feel like

26:33.525 --> 26:34.960
they're a part of
the conversation.

26:34.960 --> 26:38.397
It's so baffling that, like,
a human could say

26:38.397 --> 26:41.066
I don't want another human
to have the same rights as me.

26:41.066 --> 26:42.468
[Nina] Girl, it's fear.

26:42.468 --> 26:45.771
You know, my sophomore year,
I was openly gay in college,

26:45.771 --> 26:47.873
and I ran
for student government.

26:47.873 --> 26:50.576
And so this
underground hate group

26:50.576 --> 26:53.812
that was on our really small
conservative college campus

26:53.812 --> 26:56.148
took it upon themselves
to harass me,

26:56.148 --> 26:58.317
to break into my dorm room,

26:58.317 --> 27:01.487
to like threaten my life and say
they were going to kill me.

27:01.487 --> 27:03.121
What the fuck?

27:03.121 --> 27:06.492
I came home, and there was
"fag" carved on my door.

27:06.492 --> 27:09.428
There was a paper
shoved underneath my door

27:09.428 --> 27:11.630
threatening me.
The next night,

27:11.630 --> 27:14.266
there was a voice distortion
message on my phone

27:14.266 --> 27:16.034
that said, "You dirty faggot,
we're coming to kill you."

27:16.034 --> 27:18.704
One of my students came
and knocked on the door

27:18.704 --> 27:21.807
and said, "Someone's trying
to break into the building."

27:21.807 --> 27:23.575
And I picked up the phone,

27:23.575 --> 27:27.112
and it was that distorted voice
saying "We're getting inside.

27:27.112 --> 27:28.747
We're gonna get you."

27:28.747 --> 27:31.850
It was so scary.

27:31.850 --> 27:34.152
I can remember thinking...

27:40.125 --> 27:43.996
That I was in trouble.

27:43.996 --> 27:46.164
I had to move out
of my dorm room

27:46.164 --> 27:48.333
and move into an all-girls dorm,

27:48.333 --> 27:50.102
and basically hide
for two weeks,

27:50.102 --> 27:51.570
until they found the person
who was--

27:51.570 --> 27:53.605
[Brooke Lynn] Oh, my God.

27:53.605 --> 27:55.674
-Horrible. I'm so sorry.
-It was awful.

27:55.674 --> 27:58.677
This is during the time period
of Matthew Shepard.

27:58.677 --> 28:01.513
Matthew Shepard was
a college student in Wyoming

28:01.513 --> 28:02.915
who went out to a bar,

28:02.915 --> 28:06.018
and these monsters
picked him up,

28:06.018 --> 28:07.786
they beat him to death,

28:07.786 --> 28:11.089
and hung him on a fence.

28:11.089 --> 28:15.093
The Matthew Shepard murder
changed my life.

28:15.093 --> 28:17.796
This is why I'm involved
in gay rights issues,

28:17.796 --> 28:20.866
because I don't anyone to
ever feel that way that I felt,

28:20.866 --> 28:23.368
that I was suicidal
or that I wasn't good enough

28:23.368 --> 28:25.070
or that I didn't belong.

28:25.070 --> 28:26.371
That's why I do what I do,

28:26.371 --> 28:28.206
'cause I never want anyone
to feel that way.

28:28.206 --> 28:31.510
Because it's--it is awful,
you know?

28:31.510 --> 28:34.479
You don't want to ever
feel like you don't matter.

28:34.479 --> 28:37.449
We live in a culture right now

28:37.449 --> 28:39.284
where divisive rhetoric
is winning.

28:39.284 --> 28:41.053
It is our responsibility

28:41.053 --> 28:43.288
to create the world
that we want to live in.

28:43.288 --> 28:46.024
Don't let anyone tell you
your voice doesn't matter.

28:46.024 --> 28:48.927
We all have the power
to hopefully exact change.

28:50.529 --> 28:52.764
[Mercedes] Hearing Nina's story,
I feel the same.

28:52.764 --> 28:55.467
Like, being Muslim,
I can relate to that.

28:55.467 --> 28:56.935
And I was like, you know what?

28:56.935 --> 28:59.271
I should be--

28:59.271 --> 29:01.273
I should be open
about my religion,

29:01.273 --> 29:03.742
because last week,
I walked off.

29:03.742 --> 29:06.912
In your culture,
how do y'all worship Allah?

29:06.912 --> 29:08.647
I gotta get ready.

29:09.982 --> 29:12.050
Can you come real quick?

29:12.050 --> 29:14.453
So today I'm pulling them
to the side

29:14.453 --> 29:17.322
and tell them the reason why.

29:17.322 --> 29:19.625
-Hey, y'all.
-Hey, girl.

29:19.625 --> 29:23.595
Remember last time we were
talking about different religion

29:23.595 --> 29:25.764
and I just like stormed off?

29:25.764 --> 29:27.833
And it was kind of rude
for me to do that,

29:27.833 --> 29:31.103
because I didn't--I basically
don't talk about religion.

29:31.103 --> 29:33.905
And the reason why
it's really hard,

29:33.905 --> 29:35.340
especially in this country

29:35.340 --> 29:37.242
where people, like,
if it was, something happens

29:37.242 --> 29:39.344
and, you know,
involving Muslims,

29:39.344 --> 29:41.346
it's like, oh, they're
terrorists, you know.

29:41.346 --> 29:43.148
And I don't want people to feel

29:43.148 --> 29:45.450
like every Muslim
is a terrorist.

29:45.450 --> 29:47.586

really talk about it,

29:47.586 --> 29:49.388

to you guys.

29:54.426 --> 29:55.961

comfortable about it.

42:20.438 --> 42:23.641
[Yvie] I'm serving you

shaking my big-top tent,

42:25.476 --> 42:28.346

big-bottom tent.

42:28.346 --> 42:29.814
I might be all bows and smiles,

42:46.030 --> 42:47.632
This corset
is the actual piece

43:00.344 --> 43:03.414
[Ra'Jah] I'm wearing
a sickening badass catsuit

43:03.414 --> 43:04.749
with the chaps to match,

43:04.749 --> 43:08.186
and I'm rocking
this super sickening pixie cut.

43:23.935 --> 43:26.337
[Nina] I'm wearing this
Hello, Dolly inspired look

43:26.337 --> 43:27.738
because I wanted to reference

43:27.738 --> 43:30.308
my favorite liberal activist,
Barbra Streisand.

43:30.308 --> 43:31.676
I like to serve a character.

43:31.676 --> 43:33.010
I want to be theatrical
on the runway.

43:33.010 --> 43:34.045
[Ross] To get those feathers,

she had to pluck
a cock-or-two.

45:03.267 --> 45:05.803
[Ariel] Orange isn't typically
a color I would wear

45:05.803 --> 45:07.371
unless it's on my skin,
because, you know,

You always do the unexpected.

48:17.728 --> 48:19.630
I think you look so great.

48:19.630 --> 48:20.631
Did you make
this little headpiece?

48:20.631 --> 48:21.632
My hair?

48:21.632 --> 48:22.833
-[laughs]
-[Yvie] Yes, I did.

48:22.833 --> 48:25.236
When you can't see anybody else

48:25.236 --> 48:26.771
doing what somebody does,

48:26.771 --> 48:29.473
that's when you know you're
doing something new and unique.

I can't wait to see
what Yvie Oddly does next.

48:59.336 --> 49:00.871
Your makeup's beautiful.

49:00.871 --> 49:02.039
Yeah, you look great.

49:02.039 --> 49:04.809
You look like
on-fire Liza Minnelli.

49:04.809 --> 49:06.177
[RuPaul laughs]

49:06.177 --> 49:07.311
Let's talk about Omarosa.

49:07.311 --> 49:08.479
Okay.

49:08.479 --> 49:11.182
I have a little experience
with Omarosa.

49:11.182 --> 49:14.385
Okay, I shared a toilet
for 29 days with Omarosa.

49:14.385 --> 49:16.220
[all laugh]

49:16.220 --> 49:19.156
She owns any room that she's in.

49:19.156 --> 49:24.128
The problem with your Omarosa
is that we didn't notice you.

49:24.128 --> 49:25.563
When you think Omarosa,

49:25.563 --> 49:27.665
you don't think pretty,
you don't think sweet.

49:27.665 --> 49:28.866
I wanted to loathe you more.

49:28.866 --> 49:31.068
That's the villain
that she plays.

49:31.068 --> 49:33.504
I didn't get that.
I kind of lost you.

49:33.504 --> 49:36.674
I really didn't see you
punch it up,

49:36.674 --> 49:39.343
and I was left
a little disappointed.

49:39.343 --> 49:43.914
[Rupaul] Up next,
Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

49:43.914 --> 49:45.950
You are painted on point,
darling.

49:45.950 --> 49:49.386
You are just serving it
all the way tonight.

49:49.386 --> 49:53.023
Listen, a plus-size woman
really needs to be celebrated.

49:53.023 --> 49:56.627
And I love the style and
silhouette of dress you chose.

49:56.627 --> 49:59.430
♪ Silky Ganache ♪

49:59.430 --> 50:01.632
[all laugh]

50:01.632 --> 50:03.834
-That was so good.
-Thank you.

50:03.834 --> 50:05.102
[Ross] You looked like her,

50:05.102 --> 50:07.938
and my eyes
went directly to you.

50:07.938 --> 50:09.840
I bought that you were Oprah.

50:09.840 --> 50:12.309
You came out for your moment,
nailed it,

50:12.309 --> 50:15.779
and I would like to sign you
to your own spinoff show

50:15.779 --> 50:17.348
after RuPaul's Drag Race.

50:17.348 --> 50:19.316
I'm gonna hold you
to your word on that, honey.

50:19.316 --> 50:20.985
Yeah, you'll have to pay
for everything, but...

50:20.985 --> 50:22.686
[all laugh]

50:22.686 --> 50:24.688
What would your spinoff show
be called?

50:24.688 --> 50:27.391
Chocolate Flavor of Love.

50:27.391 --> 50:29.059
[all laugh]

50:29.059 --> 50:31.195
Bitch, Silky's
in the motherfucking house.

50:31.195 --> 50:33.664
[all laugh]

50:33.664 --> 50:36.200
Mercedes Iman Diamond.

50:36.200 --> 50:39.036
You look ama-zing.

50:39.036 --> 50:40.838
A black woman with blonde hair

50:40.838 --> 50:43.173
is not celebrated enough
in this country.

50:43.173 --> 50:45.209
Ru, can I get a hello?

50:45.209 --> 50:46.210
Hellurrrr.

50:46.210 --> 50:48.112
[all laugh]

50:48.112 --> 50:51.015
Like the neck up, super happy.

50:51.015 --> 50:53.851
But the neck down
is just too ordinary for me.

50:53.851 --> 50:56.220
Here's your problem
with Ivanka Trump tonight.

50:56.220 --> 50:58.889
You had a very small part,
so you have to pop.

50:58.889 --> 51:01.926
And it wasn't screaming
Ivanka Trump.

51:01.926 --> 51:04.461
You have to go overboard,
like Yvie did.

51:04.461 --> 51:06.397
You just sort of disappeared.

51:07.698 --> 51:10.567
Up next, Vanessa Vanjie Mateo.

51:10.567 --> 51:12.603
This is exquisite.

51:12.603 --> 51:15.773
High-priced showgirl.
I love this look.

51:15.773 --> 51:17.875
But I think this is probably
the third time

51:17.875 --> 51:20.678
with the corset, panties, and
chest glitter that we've seen.

51:20.678 --> 51:24.848
So though you look beautiful,
I want to see something new now.

51:26.116 --> 51:28.385
Rosie O'Donnell
is a great character to get

51:28.385 --> 51:30.087
because there's so much there.

51:30.087 --> 51:32.723
But, honey,
you were Rosie No'Donnell.

51:32.723 --> 51:35.793
[Tiffany] I want to say
I've always had the fantasy

51:35.793 --> 51:37.695
of sitting
on Rosie O'Donnell's face.

51:38.862 --> 51:40.431
-Oh.
-But...

51:40.431 --> 51:42.900
Tell us more.
[all laugh]

51:42.900 --> 51:45.002
But tonight, Rosie O'Donnell
wasn't present,

51:45.002 --> 51:47.705
because I kept my legs closed
the whole time you performed.

51:47.705 --> 51:50.107
[all laugh]

51:50.107 --> 51:51.709
You obviously know how
to perform and dance

51:51.709 --> 51:53.444
and work it and sell it.

51:53.444 --> 51:55.579
[Ross] You're good. I'd watch
you do just about anything.

51:55.579 --> 51:56.981
You want to take a nap?
I'll watch you do it.

51:56.981 --> 51:59.183
[all laugh]

51:59.183 --> 52:02.052
But the challenge is to be
Rosie O'Donnell out there.

52:02.052 --> 52:04.555
We got a lesbian flygirl.

52:04.555 --> 52:06.790
Up next, Brooke Lynn Hytes.

52:06.790 --> 52:08.492
I love your take
on orange alert.

52:08.492 --> 52:11.762
It's just so chic
and so futuristic.

52:11.762 --> 52:13.230
And I love a boot
you can check your teeth in.

52:13.230 --> 52:14.465
[all laugh]

52:14.465 --> 52:16.600
What's your background?
Are you Norwegian?

52:16.600 --> 52:18.936
I'm Swedish, actually.
I'm Swedish and French.

52:18.936 --> 52:20.704
Oh, okay.
Is that near "Norwegia?"

52:20.704 --> 52:23.374
Yeah, it's Scandinavia.
It's up there.

52:23.374 --> 52:26.110
Okay. I knew
that you were regal.

52:26.110 --> 52:29.780
That performance, that look
is why you're back in the top.

52:29.780 --> 52:32.549
I get that you have
the "Norwegia" bone structure.

52:32.549 --> 52:35.486
[all laugh]
But, uhh...

52:35.486 --> 52:37.821
when you first came out,
I knew you were Ivana.

52:37.821 --> 52:39.323
It was so good.

52:39.323 --> 52:41.625
You filled up a character
while doing all the dance moves.

52:41.625 --> 52:42.626
Well done.

52:42.626 --> 52:44.294
Guess who's back in the top?

52:44.294 --> 52:47.331
[laughs]

52:47.331 --> 52:49.566
-Thank you, Brooke Lynn.
-Thank you, Ru.

52:49.566 --> 52:52.469
While you untuck backstage,

52:52.469 --> 52:54.438
the judges and I
will deliberate.

52:55.806 --> 52:57.541
All right, now just between
us squirrel friends,

52:57.541 --> 53:00.077
what do you think?

53:00.077 --> 53:01.445
Yvie Oddly.

53:01.445 --> 53:04.948
She is the most distinct
of the entire group.

53:04.948 --> 53:06.316
I loved it.

53:06.316 --> 53:10.020
She had it hard as Kellyanne
Conway, and she nailed it.

53:10.020 --> 53:12.589
Yvie is like a big bold flavor,
you know.

53:12.589 --> 53:14.892
And it doesn't go
with everything,

53:14.892 --> 53:16.994
but when it works,
oh, my God, it works.

53:16.994 --> 53:19.163
[RuPaul] I think
it's really refreshing,

53:19.163 --> 53:22.666
because no one else is doing
what Yvie Oddly is doing.

53:22.666 --> 53:24.568
Ra'Jah O'Hara.

53:24.568 --> 53:26.737
Orange alert look was on.

53:26.737 --> 53:30.808
She was just reading
Lady Sings The Blues.

53:30.808 --> 53:33.777
Dreamgirls, Supremes,
all that good stuff.

53:33.777 --> 53:36.080
I see Diana Ross.
I see Lola Falana.

53:36.080 --> 53:37.748
But unfortunately
in the challenge,

53:37.748 --> 53:39.917
I did not see Omarosa.

53:39.917 --> 53:42.119
Listen, I'm not going
to throw shade at Omarosa,

53:42.119 --> 53:43.654
and I'll tell you why.

53:43.654 --> 53:45.489
-'Cause you're scared.
-'Cause I'm scared of her.

53:45.489 --> 53:46.723
That's exactly why.

53:46.723 --> 53:48.125
[all laugh]

53:48.125 --> 53:50.794
Omarosa has
an unforgettable presence,

53:50.794 --> 53:53.230
but I lost Ra'Jah tonight.

53:53.230 --> 53:55.499
You, ma'am, are no Omarosa.

53:55.499 --> 53:58.135
No-marosa.

53:58.135 --> 54:00.537
[RuPaul] Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

54:00.537 --> 54:03.373
That was a star-making turn
as Oprah, I think, for Silky.

54:03.373 --> 54:05.976
It wasn't just
"I dressed up as Oprah

54:05.976 --> 54:07.411
and now I'm walking out here."

54:07.411 --> 54:10.581
She really did
a great impression of her.

54:10.581 --> 54:13.650
Undeniably,
she's got the star quality.

54:13.650 --> 54:16.754
[RuPaul] Mercedes Iman Diamond.

54:16.754 --> 54:17.988
Tonight on the runway
she looked gorgeous.

54:17.988 --> 54:20.791
But it doesn't deflect
from the fact

54:20.791 --> 54:22.926
that she just got
completely lost as Ivanka.

54:22.926 --> 54:24.027
There was nothing.

54:24.027 --> 54:25.496
[Ross] Mercedes
should have played Donald,

54:25.496 --> 54:26.864
'cause she had no character.

54:26.864 --> 54:28.098
[Michelle] Oh, no.

54:28.098 --> 54:29.266
[Ross] Ivanka's
a tougher character,

54:29.266 --> 54:31.468
but she didn't do
anything with it.

54:31.468 --> 54:33.737
[RuPaul]
Vanessa Vanjie Mateo.

54:33.737 --> 54:37.975
Vanjie's Rosie O'Donnell
reminded me of when I have sex.

54:37.975 --> 54:40.577
You know, like she tried really
hard and everybody laughed,

54:40.577 --> 54:42.446
but it just missed the mark.

54:42.446 --> 54:44.481
[Joel] Ross, you are
too hard on yourself.

54:44.481 --> 54:47.484
No, you've never
had sex with me.

54:47.484 --> 54:50.754
But she is so watchable.

54:50.754 --> 54:52.189
[RuPaul] She reminds
of Alyssa Edwards

54:52.189 --> 54:55.592
in that everything she does
is so exciting and funny.

54:55.592 --> 54:58.395
But she hasn't been able
to hone it into a character

54:58.395 --> 55:00.731
in a way that would get her
a SAG card.

55:00.731 --> 55:02.199
Brooke Lynn Hytes.

55:02.199 --> 55:03.433
Her orange alert look,

55:03.433 --> 55:06.203
she was a huge beautiful
piece of fruit leather.

55:06.203 --> 55:08.438
And I say that
as a compliment.

55:08.438 --> 55:10.541
And she killed it
in the challenge.

55:10.541 --> 55:12.876
She's a big threat
in this competition.

55:12.876 --> 55:15.946
It was like she came out here
renewed with vim and vigor.

55:15.946 --> 55:16.947
Wait, what did you just call me?

55:16.947 --> 55:18.215
Oh, I'm sorry.

55:18.215 --> 55:19.483
Vigor, with a "V".

55:19.483 --> 55:22.519
Silence.
I've made my decision.

55:22.519 --> 55:25.022
Bring back my girls.

55:25.022 --> 55:26.423
[Joel] Yeah!

55:28.158 --> 55:30.327
[RuPaul] Welcome back, ladies.

55:30.327 --> 55:32.196
I've made some decisions.

55:34.998 --> 55:36.033
Yvie Oddly.

55:37.734 --> 55:38.835
You're safe.

55:38.835 --> 55:40.370
Thank you.

55:41.405 --> 55:43.674
Silky Nutmeg Ganache,

55:43.674 --> 55:47.878
Tonight, you own everything.

55:47.878 --> 55:49.413
Con-drag-ulations.

55:49.413 --> 55:50.581
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.

55:50.581 --> 55:52.149
Oh, my God.

55:52.149 --> 55:53.150
[applause]

55:53.150 --> 55:54.151
This is crazy.

55:54.151 --> 55:56.853
You've won a fabulous getaway

55:56.853 --> 55:58.855
to the Grand Resort And Spa,

55:58.855 --> 56:03.827
Fort Lauderdale's premiere
gay resort and day spa.

56:03.827 --> 56:04.928
Well, thank you.

56:04.928 --> 56:08.298
Hell, no.
I won, bitch.

56:08.298 --> 56:09.600
Whoop-whoo-de-whoo-whoo-whop.

56:14.338 --> 56:15.372
Brooke Lynn Hytes.

56:16.940 --> 56:18.809
-You're safe.
-Thank you very much.

56:18.809 --> 56:20.877
[applause]

56:20.877 --> 56:24.047
[RuPaul] Mercedes Iman
Diamond...

56:24.047 --> 56:27.184
your Ivanka was feckless.

56:28.585 --> 56:31.922
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

56:34.925 --> 56:37.995
Ra'Jah O'Hara...

56:37.995 --> 56:40.264
your Omarosa
got trumped by the other queens.

56:41.765 --> 56:44.334
Vanessa Vanjie Mateo...

56:44.334 --> 56:46.970
your Rosie was not
in a league of her own.

56:50.540 --> 56:51.508
Vanjie,

56:54.111 --> 56:55.145
You are safe.

56:59.516 --> 57:00.550
You may join the other girls.

57:02.419 --> 57:03.687
[RuPaul] Ra'Jah, my dear,

57:03.687 --> 57:07.157
I am sorry, but you are up
for elimination.

57:07.157 --> 57:11.528
[Ra'Jah] How in the fuck

57:11.528 --> 57:14.931
did I end up in the bottom
again this fucking week?

57:14.931 --> 57:17.434
Like, really?

57:17.434 --> 57:20.637
Two queens stand before me.

57:20.637 --> 57:25.075
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

57:25.075 --> 57:28.312
and save yourself
from elimination.

57:30.847 --> 57:32.749
The time has come...
[thunder]

57:32.749 --> 57:35.252
for you to lip sync...

57:35.252 --> 57:39.556
