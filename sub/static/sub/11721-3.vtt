00:02.803 --> 00:05.137
<i>Previously on</i> Hawaii Five-O...

00:05.839 --> 00:07.505
Grace?

00:07.507 --> 00:09.173
<i>What are you doing in my house?</i>

00:09.175 --> 00:11.175
Who are you?
I'm Marco Reyes.

00:11.177 --> 00:12.560
Your brother never
mentioned me to you?

00:12.562 --> 00:14.262
What is it
that I can do for you?

00:14.264 --> 00:15.847
Your brother took something
from me.

00:15.849 --> 00:18.149
And you're gonna help me
get it back.

00:18.151 --> 00:19.734
<i>When your brother</i>

00:19.736 --> 00:21.185
disappeared,
he was in possession

00:21.187 --> 00:23.321
of a significant amount
of my money.

00:23.323 --> 00:24.489
Okay, how much money?

00:24.491 --> 00:26.691
18 and a half million dollars.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.993
Well, I, unfortunately,
don't know anything about that.

00:28.995 --> 00:31.012
I haven't seen or spoken
to my brother in three years.

00:31.014 --> 00:33.414
Do you really think
that I'm the kind of guy

00:33.416 --> 00:35.483
who doesn't get what he wants?

00:35.485 --> 00:36.617
I strongly suggest that you just

00:36.619 --> 00:37.952
get on a plane
and never come back.

00:37.954 --> 00:39.537
As soon as I get my money,

00:39.539 --> 00:41.005
that's exactly what I'll do.

00:41.007 --> 00:42.256
I don't know where
your money is. I don't have it.

00:42.258 --> 00:44.842
Matthew tells a
very different story.

00:44.844 --> 00:48.880
Of course people tend to
say anything when they have

00:48.882 --> 00:51.182
a gun to their head.

00:55.555 --> 00:57.688
Hey.

00:57.690 --> 01:00.474
Marco Reyes has my brother.

01:02.195 --> 01:03.611
What are you talking about?
Matt?

01:03.613 --> 01:04.861
Yeah, how do you...
how do you know?

01:04.864 --> 01:06.197
What did he say exactly?

01:06.199 --> 01:08.983
He said that he has him,
he put a gun to his head and...

01:12.205 --> 01:14.405
Did Matt tell you
where that money is?

01:14.407 --> 01:16.791
No, he did not tell me
where the money is.

01:16.793 --> 01:19.160
Then how do you know
Reyes wasn't bluffing, okay?

01:19.162 --> 01:21.245
Telling you he had Matt to get
you to turn over that cash?

01:21.247 --> 01:24.549
Okay, uh, what if he's not? Huh?

01:24.551 --> 01:26.918
Danny, your brother's been a
fugitive for three years, okay?

01:26.920 --> 01:28.419
If that money existed,

01:28.421 --> 01:30.638
he'd be using it
to stay under the radar.

01:30.640 --> 01:32.807
And if that's the case,
Reyes doesn't have your brother,

01:32.809 --> 01:34.342
because he'd know
where the money is.

01:34.344 --> 01:35.927
What the hell
are you talking about?

01:35.929 --> 01:37.511
What, are you trying
to confuse me?

01:37.513 --> 01:39.430
I'm angry.
You want to make me more angry?

01:39.432 --> 01:40.598
What does that mean?

01:40.600 --> 01:42.066
Listen to me: My point is,

01:42.068 --> 01:44.685
if Matt stole 18 and
a half million dollars,

01:44.687 --> 01:46.270
maybe Reyes is rattling
your cage

01:46.272 --> 01:48.689
to see if you know
where your brother is.

01:48.691 --> 01:50.575
And if that's

01:50.577 --> 01:52.944
the case, I say,
you rattle back.

For those of you
who just joined us,<i> aloha kakahiaka!</i>

02:42.745 --> 02:44.578
Couldn't have picked
a better day to see

02:44.580 --> 02:46.914
the enchanting beauty of Oahu.

02:46.916 --> 02:48.833
The name “Oahu” means

02:48.835 --> 02:52.670
“the gathering place,” and it
certainly lives up to its name.

02:52.672 --> 02:54.722
<i>There's so much</i>
<i>to see and experience</i>

02:54.724 --> 02:57.291

So, on our right,
is the exquisite

03:05.351 --> 03:07.518
Moana Surfrider Resort and Spa.

03:07.520 --> 03:10.371
<i>Opened in 1901,</i>

03:10.373 --> 03:15.443
this legendary landmark is known
as the “First Lady of Waikiki.”

03:18.715 --> 03:20.448
Aloha.

03:20.450 --> 03:23.534
Aloha. Aloha.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.720
Aloha.

03:26.756 --> 03:30.107
Further down on your right,
keep your eye out

03:30.109 --> 03:32.793
for one of our most popular
sights on Waikiki Beach,

03:32.795 --> 03:34.762
the Duke Kahanamoku Statue.

03:34.764 --> 03:38.866
Duke is one of the most beloved
legends in Hawaiian history.

03:38.868 --> 03:41.886
Hollywood actor, Olympic legend

03:41.888 --> 03:45.039
and the father
of modern-day surfing.

03:45.041 --> 03:47.842
So, take a picture,
leave your leis,

03:47.844 --> 03:49.210
and rub...

03:49.212 --> 03:51.896
Don't move. Pull over.

03:51.898 --> 03:54.231
I said, pull over! Now!

03:54.233 --> 03:56.450
What?
Donation time.

03:56.452 --> 03:59.120
That's right!
This is a gun!

03:59.122 --> 04:01.122
It puts holes in people.

04:01.124 --> 04:02.957
Now if you don't want
to leave this island

04:02.959 --> 04:05.493
in a box, you'll do as we say.

04:05.495 --> 04:09.930
Everyone, pass your valuables
to my new friend here.

04:09.932 --> 04:11.565
Now!

04:11.567 --> 04:12.750
Phones,

04:12.752 --> 04:14.301

Let's go! Let's go!
Come on, move it! Move it!

04:16.589 --> 04:19.223
Hand it over.
Hand it over.

Let's go! Move it!

04:20.610 --> 04:23.127
Get 'em out.

04:23.129 --> 04:25.046
You, aloha shirt gone bad...

04:25.048 --> 04:26.480
- get up.
- Please.

04:26.482 --> 04:30.217

So, we're up here.

06:12.705 --> 06:14.505
Not exactly
your picture-perfect postcard

06:14.507 --> 06:15.706
of a tropical
dream vacation.

06:15.708 --> 06:17.424
What do we know
about our Vic?

06:17.426 --> 06:18.709
His name is
Nathan Wagner.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.711
He's president of a major
I.T. security firm

06:20.713 --> 06:23.380
specializing in encryption,
network administration

06:23.382 --> 06:24.932
and some type
of hi-tech firewall

06:24.934 --> 06:27.051
that I'm not even going
to try to pronounce.

06:27.053 --> 06:28.719
He was here
for a tech conference.

06:28.721 --> 06:29.887
He tried to resist,

06:29.889 --> 06:32.223
and one of the perps
put a slug in his chest.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.441
And his wife Monica caught
a round in the arm.

06:35.228 --> 06:38.145
Please just let me see
my husband.

06:38.147 --> 06:40.231
Mrs. Wagner, there's nothing
you can do for him now.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.867
I just want to see him
one more time.

06:42.869 --> 06:44.118
I'm so sorry.

06:44.120 --> 06:46.120
What about the shooters?

06:46.122 --> 06:49.123
Three women, early 20's-- a
redhead, brunette and a blonde.

06:49.125 --> 06:51.876
They were all wearing bikinis,
backpacks, sunglasses and hats.

06:51.878 --> 06:53.911
Oh, good.
That, uh, really

06:53.913 --> 06:55.996
narrows it down.
All right.

06:55.998 --> 06:57.831
So, as soon as they
got off the bus,

06:57.833 --> 06:59.583
they blended right
into the crowd.

06:59.585 --> 07:02.253
You know, these girls
are pulling old-school

07:02.255 --> 07:03.504
stagecoach robberies.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.839
It's a lot of exposure,
but they're also smart.

07:05.841 --> 07:08.509
HPD has them hitting four tour
buses in the past six months,

07:08.511 --> 07:10.177
but they're switching it up
every time.

07:10.179 --> 07:12.396
Different outfits, different
buses, times and stops.

07:12.398 --> 07:13.931
But they never hurt anyone.

07:13.933 --> 07:16.433
- Yeah, until now.
- Kono,

07:16.435 --> 07:17.768
I want traffic cam footage.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.436
Get HPD out there
shaking the trees.

07:19.438 --> 07:21.088
Canvass every pawn
shop on the island.

07:21.090 --> 07:22.990
Let's see if they're
moving the stolen merch

07:22.992 --> 07:24.441
through online sites
or known fences.

07:24.443 --> 07:26.777
Probably wouldn't hurt
to compile a list

07:26.779 --> 07:28.946
of the passengers' cell phones.
Might be able to lock

07:28.948 --> 07:30.247
onto a GPS signal.
That's good.

07:30.249 --> 07:32.283
On it.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.784
What about the wife?
She give you anything?

07:33.786 --> 07:35.035
Yeah. Good look
at the shooter

07:35.037 --> 07:36.754
after her sunglasses
came off in the struggle.

07:36.756 --> 07:38.005
After she's released
from the hospital,

07:38.007 --> 07:39.924
I'll put her in front of some photos.
All right.

07:39.926 --> 07:42.293
So our Vic puts up a fight,
and ends up in the morgue.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.961
I'm sure these girls
weren't expecting

07:43.963 --> 07:45.879
resistance, but it's
clear they're not gonna

07:45.881 --> 07:47.214
hesitate to
pull the trigger.

07:47.216 --> 07:48.549
With all due respect, Commander,

07:48.551 --> 07:51.435
I think Nathan Wagner was a
lot more than a random victim.

07:53.055 --> 07:56.023
If you're soliciting
opinions, I mean.

07:56.025 --> 07:57.641
Does Dr. Bergman concur?

07:57.643 --> 07:59.193
He's back at the ranch.

07:59.195 --> 08:01.946
Took the training wheels off, is
letting me fly solo on this one.

08:01.948 --> 08:03.897
Well...!
Good for you.

08:03.899 --> 08:05.032
Welcome to the big leagues.

08:05.034 --> 08:06.483
All right, kid, you're up.

08:06.485 --> 08:08.319
Well...

08:08.321 --> 08:11.438
I think your victim was actually
the target of this robbery.

08:14.493 --> 08:16.160
During my preliminary
examination,

08:16.162 --> 08:18.996
I ran ALS over the deceased,
and I discovered this.

08:20.916 --> 08:23.334
Well, I can't imagine

08:23.336 --> 08:24.718
the perps were carrying an ALS,

08:24.720 --> 08:26.754
so, what makes you think
they saw it?

08:26.756 --> 08:28.339
These UV glasses.

08:28.341 --> 08:31.508
CSU recovered them on
the top deck of the bus.

08:31.510 --> 08:35.763
Witnesses said they saw one
of our suspects wearing them.

08:37.099 --> 08:40.851
All right,

08:40.852 --> 08:43.703
I already did.
He's the only one.

08:45.024 --> 08:46.190
That's impressive work,
Dr. Shaw.

08:46.192 --> 08:49.360
Mahalo, Commander.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.528
So, if this guy's

08:51.530 --> 08:53.530
clothes were marked
before he got on the bus,

08:53.532 --> 08:54.698
these girls had help.

08:54.700 --> 08:55.916
Hmm. All right.

08:55.918 --> 08:57.868
Well, Wagner and his wife
were both staying

08:57.870 --> 08:58.919
at the Grand Aupuni, right?

08:58.921 --> 09:00.337
Yeah.

09:00.339 --> 09:02.539
I'll contact the hotel,
put together an exact timeline

09:02.541 --> 09:04.708
of their day
before they ended up here.

09:06.545 --> 09:09.713
This guy's a successful
business man, right?

09:09.715 --> 09:12.049
So, any property or cash
that was taken from him

09:12.051 --> 09:14.218
could easily
have been replaced.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.853
Why put up a fight?

09:15.855 --> 09:17.721
Not to mention,
the guy's with his wife.

09:17.723 --> 09:20.557
Only reason I can even see him
putting her in danger is

09:20.559 --> 09:22.810
if these girls were after
something he couldn't replace.

09:22.812 --> 09:25.896
Whatever it was...

09:25.898 --> 09:29.149
cost him his life.

09:53.661 --> 09:54.693
<i>Matty.</i>

09:54.695 --> 09:56.328
Matty.

09:56.330 --> 09:59.615
- Matthew Williams, hey!
<i>- Matty.</i>

10:02.753 --> 10:04.060
Gonna shoot me, Danny?

10:04.084 --> 10:06.005
I should shoot you,
you stupid son of a bitch!

10:06.006 --> 10:07.372
Huh? Laundering

10:07.374 --> 10:09.541
money for drug dealers?!
What the hell's

10:09.543 --> 10:11.176
the matter with you?
I had no choice.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.545
You did have a choice.
You had a choice.

10:13.547 --> 10:15.431
I gave you a choice.
I said I was gonna help you.

10:15.433 --> 10:18.383
I said I was gonna get you
through this, didn't I?

10:18.385 --> 10:20.886
This ends  two ways,
big brother.

10:20.888 --> 10:23.388
You either shoot me,

10:23.390 --> 10:25.557
or you say good-bye.

11:06.322 --> 11:07.910
I know you're supposed
to be good at your job,

11:07.911 --> 11:09.694
but I see you everywhere I go.

11:09.696 --> 11:11.279
Well, it's not an accident,
you know?

11:11.281 --> 11:12.947
You're wasting your time.

11:12.949 --> 11:15.961
It'd be better spent going out
and getting my money.

11:15.962 --> 11:17.035
Your money, okay.
Well, here's the thing.

11:17.037 --> 11:18.586
Screw you.
Screw your money.

11:18.588 --> 11:20.755
You say you got my brother?
Where is he?

11:20.757 --> 11:23.091
Matty's gonna be fine
as long as I get what I want.

11:23.093 --> 11:24.876
Yeah?

11:26.546 --> 11:28.212
Huh?

11:28.214 --> 11:32.300
You know I could..press
charges for that, Detective.

11:32.302 --> 11:35.269
Yeah?
But that would only waste more time.

11:37.390 --> 11:39.640
My money...
for your brother.

11:39.642 --> 11:42.477
You see, here's the thing,
I don't believe you, okay?

11:42.479 --> 11:44.228
You are bluffing.

11:44.230 --> 11:46.948
Do you really want
to take that chance?

11:46.950 --> 11:50.234
Okay... okay,
then I want to talk to Matt.

11:50.236 --> 11:52.320
When I get what
I came here for.

11:52.322 --> 11:54.989
Lo, I fly home tonight.

11:56.743 --> 11:59.460
You have until Monday
to bring my money to this address.

11:59.462 --> 12:01.412
That's three days.

12:01.414 --> 12:04.832
Okay, what happens
if I don't bring you the money?

12:04.834 --> 12:08.252
You'll get a package
with your brother's head in it.

12:16.012 --> 12:19.180
Have a nice rest of your day,
Detective.

12:32.362 --> 12:33.694
Your suspects were
wearing these wigs.

12:33.696 --> 12:35.496
HPD found them dumped
near the crime scene.

12:35.498 --> 12:38.416
Okay, they tell you anything?
I was able to recover

12:38.418 --> 12:40.752
human hair samples from all three.
Nice.

12:40.754 --> 12:43.004
Your suspects are actually
two brunettes and a blonde.

12:43.006 --> 12:45.807
Okay, tell me you have a hit
in CODIS, and lunch is on me.

12:45.809 --> 12:48.009
Sorry, their DNA wasn't
in the system.

12:48.011 --> 12:50.512
But I did find something
else for you.

12:50.514 --> 12:52.514
I've recovered a substance
from the back of our vic's

12:52.516 --> 12:54.215
shirt sleeve--
likely transferred

12:54.217 --> 12:56.651
from the perp to our victim
during the struggle.

12:56.653 --> 12:59.554
It contained elements
of beeswax, paraffin

12:59.556 --> 13:00.855
and pine resin.

13:00.857 --> 13:02.290
That's surf wax.

13:02.292 --> 13:05.260
And I think I have an idea
of where our shooter

13:05.262 --> 13:06.074
catches her breaks.

13:06.098 --> 13:08.435
I am gonna end up
buying you lunch, aren't I?

13:08.699 --> 13:12.067
I found traces of sand
embedded in the surf wax.

13:12.069 --> 13:14.336
It contains a higher ratio
of olivine to carbonate

13:14.338 --> 13:15.570
than most sand on the island.

13:15.572 --> 13:16.971
And it can be found

13:16.973 --> 13:19.341
in one particular place
in great abundance:

13:19.343 --> 13:20.809
right off Diamond Head.

13:20.811 --> 13:21.910
South shore.

13:21.912 --> 13:23.778
Fong, you're a rock star.

13:23.780 --> 13:26.448
Pick a day--
shrimp's on me.

13:29.085 --> 13:31.019
<i>We ran</i>
<i>Nathan Wagner's credit cards.</i>

13:31.021 --> 13:32.654
There's been no activity
since before the robbery.

13:32.656 --> 13:34.556
According to the last receipt,
he spent breakfast

13:34.558 --> 13:37.058
at the hotel restaurant
just prior to boarding the tour bus.

13:37.060 --> 13:40.161
Okay, well, if he didn't leave the hotel
before he got on that bus,

13:40.163 --> 13:41.296
somebody must've
marked him there.

13:41.298 --> 13:43.031
<i>Which means</i>
<i>someone at the hotel</i>

13:43.033 --> 13:45.367
<i>is working with these girls--</i>
<i>whoever that was,</i>

13:45.369 --> 13:48.269
they did recon on Nathan Wagner,
I.D.'d him as a whale,

13:48.271 --> 13:50.538
and marked him before he
left the hotel this morning.

13:50.540 --> 13:52.073
You wanted a smoking gun?

13:52.075 --> 13:53.375
Well, chew on this.

13:53.377 --> 13:55.043
Not that one
chews on a gun.

13:55.045 --> 13:57.345
I'm kind of mixing metaphors
there, but you get the point.

13:57.347 --> 13:58.480
Also, hi. How's it going?

13:59.549 --> 14:01.583
Hey, Lou,
give us a minute?

14:01.585 --> 14:05.320
I got a feeling you're
gonna need more than one.

14:06.756 --> 14:09.023
Okay.

14:09.792 --> 14:12.560
Jerry, this has got to stop.
Okay.

14:12.562 --> 14:14.329
I know I said I'd
back off, but...

14:14.331 --> 14:16.700
I couldn't help myself--
curiosity got the best of me.

14:16.724 --> 14:17.400
Okay, what you call

14:17.401 --> 14:20.101
curiosity, the law
calls stalking, Jer.

14:20.103 --> 14:23.371
But this guy is counterfeiting money.
I'm sure of it.

14:23.373 --> 14:24.939
Look, the shop gets

14:24.941 --> 14:27.809
regular deliveries on
Monday and Thursday.

14:27.811 --> 14:29.744
Rare books from the mainland--
we know that's how

14:29.746 --> 14:31.546
he's sourcing his paper
for the counterfeit bills.

14:31.548 --> 14:33.481
Nope, we don't know that.
Stay with me.

14:33.483 --> 14:35.917
Because last Friday there
was a break in the pattern.

14:35.919 --> 14:38.119
Random delivery--
definitely not books.

14:38.121 --> 14:40.555
So I did a little
Dumpster diving, and...

14:40.557 --> 14:43.024
Hey, and surprise,
you found some garbage.

14:43.026 --> 14:44.726
Not garbage;
a delivery slip.

14:44.728 --> 14:46.895
The guy is now
the proud owner

14:46.897 --> 14:51.232
of a brand-new inkjet printer
using optimized DPI.

14:52.234 --> 14:54.702
Dots Per Inch.
Trust me, it's important.

14:54.704 --> 14:57.272
Okay, so what you're saying

14:57.274 --> 14:59.607
is, uh, the only thing
this printer can be used for

14:59.609 --> 15:00.909
is making counterfeit money.

15:00.911 --> 15:04.012
Well, no, of course not,
but 60% of all counterfeit bills

15:04.014 --> 15:06.881
recovered in the past year
were made on printers

15:06.883 --> 15:08.550
just like this one.
Jerry...

15:08.552 --> 15:11.119
Steve, the guy's got a
stockpile of old paper

15:11.121 --> 15:12.854
and a badass printer.

15:12.856 --> 15:15.123
All he needs is the
right kind of ink

15:15.125 --> 15:16.149
and he's printing Benjamins.

15:16.173 --> 15:18.123
Yeah, except HPD's
got nothing on this guy.

15:18.361 --> 15:20.662
Thomas Farrow is clean.
His business is legit.

15:20.664 --> 15:23.231
There's no evidence at all
of any counterfeiting.

15:23.233 --> 15:25.358
No evidence? What do you
think you're looking at?

15:25.382 --> 15:26.802
Nothing.

15:26.803 --> 15:29.471
Nothing, Jerry. You're gonna
get yourself into trouble.

15:30.473 --> 15:32.140
I see.

15:32.142 --> 15:33.274
Listen, listen to me.

15:33.276 --> 15:35.510
Hey, I'm trying
to protect you, all right?

15:35.512 --> 15:39.047
Just 'cause you want to believe
something doesn't make it true.

15:39.882 --> 15:41.416
I understand.

15:43.986 --> 15:46.187
Have a wonderful afternoon...

15:46.189 --> 15:47.889
Commander.

15:53.762 --> 15:56.397
You're joking.

15:56.399 --> 15:59.667
Hey, don't look at me--
this is McGarrett's idea.

15:59.669 --> 16:01.369
Huh?

16:01.371 --> 16:02.804
I'm not wearing this.

16:02.806 --> 16:04.672
These girls are surfers;
we know where they hang out.

16:04.674 --> 16:07.642
The only way we're gonna find them is if
they don't see us coming.

16:07.644 --> 16:10.111
What's the problem?
Okay, then it falls on me?

16:10.113 --> 16:11.746
Well, you're the surfer,
ain't ya?

16:11.748 --> 16:13.081
Yeah. Plus,
you're the only one

16:13.083 --> 16:14.482
who can walk down
on that beach

16:14.484 --> 16:16.184
without broadcasting "cop""

16:16.186 --> 16:18.386
Hey, listen, we need
eyes out there, okay?

16:18.388 --> 16:20.688
Somebody on that beach must
know who these girls are,

16:20.690 --> 16:23.525
plus, the alternative is
Grover in a Speedo.

16:23.527 --> 16:24.559
Hey.

16:24.561 --> 16:25.894
Couple of years ago,

16:25.896 --> 16:28.263
I could've pulled it off,
but, well, you know.

16:30.500 --> 16:31.799
Fine.

16:31.801 --> 16:33.868
But I pick the suit.
Fine.

16:33.870 --> 16:35.470
That'll be five dollars.

16:35.472 --> 16:37.472
Okay, thank you
very much.

16:37.474 --> 16:39.140
Hey, what's up?

16:39.142 --> 16:41.776
That was the Grand Aupuni,
where our Vic was staying.

16:41.778 --> 16:44.078
According
to the hotel manager,

16:44.080 --> 16:45.880
Wagner was staying there alone.

16:45.882 --> 16:47.682
Alone?

16:47.684 --> 16:51.119
What about his wife?
Well...

16:51.121 --> 16:53.054
according to this,

16:53.056 --> 16:56.157
she died five months ago,
from cancer.

16:56.159 --> 16:59.060
Then who the hell
was the woman on the bus?

17:08.871 --> 17:10.571
Mrs. Wagner.

17:10.574 --> 17:13.141
I-I'm, uh, I'm so sorry
for your loss.

17:13.143 --> 17:14.675
How can I help you?

17:14.678 --> 17:16.144
Um, I'm trying
to make arrangements

17:16.146 --> 17:17.945
to have my husband's body
sent home.

17:17.948 --> 17:20.601
Lieutenant Kelly told me
I should come down here.

17:20.625 --> 17:21.450
Yeah, of course.

17:21.451 --> 17:23.318
Uh, please, uh,

17:23.319 --> 17:25.353
have a seat.

17:31.927 --> 17:34.295
<i>So it turns out</i>

17:34.297 --> 17:36.931
our Mrs. Wagner
is actually an ex-con

17:36.933 --> 17:38.967
by the name of Vanessa Hansen.

17:38.969 --> 17:41.102
She's worn bracelets
in multiple states.

17:41.104 --> 17:44.606
Grand larceny, forgery, fraud--
mostly white-collar stuff.

17:44.608 --> 17:46.708
Never did any significant time.

17:46.710 --> 17:48.710
It's possible she's
working with our girls.

17:48.712 --> 17:50.745
Yeah, but why
stick around the crime scene

17:50.747 --> 17:52.046
pretending to be Wagner's wife?

17:52.048 --> 17:54.482
I mean, she had to know
we'd find out who she was.

17:54.484 --> 17:55.583
Right? Why take a chance?

17:57.454 --> 17:59.087
Yeah. McGarrett.

17:59.089 --> 18:02.023
Dr. Shaw, slow down, slow down.

18:02.025 --> 18:03.558
What happened?

18:03.560 --> 18:05.026
I was not expecting
to see the wife.

18:05.028 --> 18:06.828
She came in, I gave
her a moment alone,

18:06.830 --> 18:07.895
and after she left,

18:07.897 --> 18:09.931
I started my examination
and I found this.

18:11.166 --> 18:12.967
Wasn't here when
he was brought in.

18:14.536 --> 18:16.437
She took his thumbprint.

18:16.439 --> 18:18.706
Wait a minute,
that's why Vanessa Hansen

18:18.708 --> 18:20.241
stuck around the crime scene

18:20.243 --> 18:22.443
and pretended to be his wife--
she needed that print.

18:22.445 --> 18:24.412
Our Vic owns
an I.T. security firm.

18:24.414 --> 18:26.280
He's got clients
on the Fortune 500 list.

18:26.282 --> 18:28.616
No telling what that print
would get her access to.

18:28.618 --> 18:30.351
Okay, wait a minute.
What are the odds?

18:30.353 --> 18:32.687
All right, Hansen targets
Nathan Wagner on that tour bus,

18:32.689 --> 18:34.856
but right before she
can get what she wants,

18:34.858 --> 18:36.290
there's a stickup.
Right.

18:36.292 --> 18:38.426
Got a better chance
of getting struck by lightning.

18:38.428 --> 18:40.328
Yeah, or winning the lottery.

18:40.330 --> 18:41.896
Plus, there's
no evidence

18:41.898 --> 18:45.099
that she's working with our
little all-girl wild bunch.

18:45.101 --> 18:49.137
All right, we treat this
as two separate crimes.

19:19.884 --> 19:21.952
Good to see you,
little sistah.

19:21.954 --> 19:23.954
Hey. Howzit, Mamo?

19:23.956 --> 19:25.622
Long time no.
Yeah.

19:25.624 --> 19:28.692
You know, I sit out here
every day watching these young kids,

19:28.694 --> 19:31.028
and not one of them, not one...

19:31.030 --> 19:33.364
can shred those waves like you.

19:33.366 --> 19:35.499
I was all right.
That was a long time ago, Mamo.

19:35.501 --> 19:38.502
All right?
You were the best.

19:39.337 --> 19:41.138
So, what brings you
to my beach?

19:41.140 --> 19:43.540
Come to show these clowns how it's done?
Well, unfortunately,

19:43.542 --> 19:46.010
I'm not here for the surf;
I'm on the job.

19:46.012 --> 19:49.013
I'm looking for three girls--
late teens, early 20s.

19:49.015 --> 19:51.715
Two brunettes and one blonde.
Look around.

19:51.717 --> 19:53.217
You got your pick out here.

19:53.219 --> 19:55.519
Yeah, well,
they're most likely <i>Kama'aina.</i>

19:55.521 --> 19:57.588
Probably surf here
all the time.

19:57.590 --> 20:00.024
The swells were coming in
from the west this morning.

20:00.026 --> 20:01.425
But the wind shifted.

20:01.427 --> 20:03.994
Now the best breaks
are coming in from the south.

20:03.996 --> 20:06.130
If they're true
<i>kanaka maoli...</i>

20:06.132 --> 20:08.332
that's where they'll be.

20:08.334 --> 20:09.299
Okay.

20:09.301 --> 20:11.301
It's good to
see you, Mamo.

20:11.303 --> 20:14.004
Mahalo.
Anytime, sistah.

20:14.006 --> 20:15.372
You be careful.

20:15.374 --> 20:18.375
<i>Malama aku no.</i>
Go show 'em how it's done!

20:20.212 --> 20:22.212
Alert's out
on Vanessa Hansen.

20:22.214 --> 20:24.148
HPD's sitting
on her house now.

20:24.150 --> 20:26.183
Believe me, she knows
we're onto her.

20:26.185 --> 20:27.818
So I doubt she's
going home.

20:27.820 --> 20:29.787
Now, where are we
with Wagner's thumbprint?

20:29.789 --> 20:32.456
Well, I spoke to one
of the partners at his firm.

20:32.458 --> 20:34.291
He uses it
as a biometric key.

20:34.293 --> 20:35.659
It allows him to access files

20:35.661 --> 20:38.462
that contain highly sensitive
information about his clients.

20:38.464 --> 20:41.065
Well, information like that on
blue-chip companies could be

20:41.067 --> 20:43.500
very valuable to someone
who knows how to leverage it.

20:43.502 --> 20:45.769
You better believe it.
That's what Vanessa Hansen's after.

20:45.771 --> 20:47.071
That's my guess.

20:47.073 --> 20:48.806
Company's notifying its clients
of a potential breach.

20:48.808 --> 20:51.639
All right, we get any word
from Kono on our surfer girls?

20:51.663 --> 20:52.544
Nothing yet.

20:52.545 --> 20:54.478
HPD's still running background
on any hotel employee

20:54.480 --> 20:56.680
that might have had access
to the vic's room.

20:56.682 --> 20:59.750
Whoever marked Wagner
should lead us to our crew.

21:01.287 --> 21:03.787
- It's DC.
- Oh, that's for me. I put a call in

21:03.789 --> 21:05.055
to the Secret Service
for Jerry.

21:05.057 --> 21:06.924
You guys give me a second, please?
Sure.

21:11.863 --> 21:13.497
Agent Keane.
Thanks for getting back to me.

21:45.897 --> 21:47.965
No good waves?

21:51.202 --> 21:54.304
Surf report said it was firing
out here this morning.

21:54.306 --> 21:57.274
Do we know you?
No.

21:57.276 --> 21:59.309
Just making
friendly conversation.

21:59.311 --> 22:03.380
Well, take your friendly
conversation someplace else.

22:08.253 --> 22:10.587
You got a problem, sistah?

22:10.589 --> 22:13.056
No, it's all good.

22:13.058 --> 22:15.259
Everything's cool.

22:16.294 --> 22:18.862
That's just some nasty bruise
you got there.

22:23.301 --> 22:24.768
Cop.

22:44.756 --> 22:48.392
Where do you think you're going?
Let go of me.

23:16.454 --> 23:18.055
That was the most fun

23:18.057 --> 23:20.257
I had on a board
in a long time.

23:22.994 --> 23:24.394
Don't look at me like that.

23:24.396 --> 23:26.997
I just did you
a huge favor.

23:29.033 --> 23:32.202
First one in gets the deal.
All you have to do

23:32.204 --> 23:35.005
is tell me who your friends are
and where I can find 'em.

23:36.307 --> 23:37.908
I want a lawyer.

23:39.644 --> 23:41.211
Yeah.

23:41.213 --> 23:43.213
You're gonna need one.

23:43.215 --> 23:45.916
'Cause we found the wigs that
you dumped after the robbery.

23:45.918 --> 23:49.519
And there's still
strands of your hair inside.

23:49.521 --> 23:52.122
So when I compare
your DNA

23:52.124 --> 23:54.891
to that hair sample,

23:54.893 --> 23:57.094
we both know you're
going down for this.

24:02.601 --> 24:05.202
Lea, Lea.

24:05.204 --> 24:07.938
I know exactly who you are.

24:07.940 --> 24:10.941
You never
finished high school.

24:10.943 --> 24:12.943
You'd rather chase the waves
than get a real job, so you just

24:12.945 --> 24:15.379
knock off some, uh, unsuspecting
haoles to make ends meet.

24:15.381 --> 24:17.781
Is this the
part where you

24:17.783 --> 24:20.417
tell me you used to be like me?

24:20.419 --> 24:22.419
That we're not
all that different?

24:24.022 --> 24:26.823
No, this is the part
where I tell you I know

24:26.825 --> 24:30.027
your cousin works as a bellhop
at the Grand Aupuni.

24:30.029 --> 24:32.863
The same hotel
where the man

24:32.865 --> 24:34.998
you and your friends
murdered was staying.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.968
'Cause that's how
you've been doing this.

24:37.970 --> 24:40.370
<i>He picks out the big fish,</i>
<i>lets you know</i>

24:40.372 --> 24:42.673
<i>when they book a bus tour.</i>
<i>He gets into their room,</i>

24:42.675 --> 24:44.374
<i>marks their clothes and you</i>
Hey, Five-O!

24:44.376 --> 24:46.610
<i>and your friends do the rest.</i>

24:54.652 --> 24:56.987
Didn't your mother
tell you to look both ways?

24:56.989 --> 24:59.623
Come on.
Let's go to jail.

25:08.132 --> 25:10.734
It's over, Lea.

25:10.736 --> 25:13.704
This is the most important
decision of your life.

25:15.073 --> 25:17.274
If you ever want
to surf a break again,

25:17.276 --> 25:20.677
tell me where your friends are.

25:23.247 --> 25:25.082
Go to hell.

25:31.522 --> 25:33.690
Hey, you got a sec?

25:39.430 --> 25:40.697
Not getting anywhere.

25:40.699 --> 25:41.965
Doesn't matter--
we don't need her.

25:41.967 --> 25:44.000
The cousin just flipped
on the other two girls.

25:44.002 --> 25:45.235
We got an address.

25:45.237 --> 25:46.870
Let's go.

26:17.034 --> 26:18.668
Five-O! Freeze!

26:20.405 --> 26:22.939
Steve!
I got movement!

26:27.912 --> 26:30.414
Vanessa Hansen! Freeze!

26:41.092 --> 26:42.292
Go, go, go!

27:15.553 --> 27:19.156
No, Vanessa Hansen didn't just
stop by for a friendly visit.

27:19.602 --> 27:21.568
She was looking for something.

27:21.570 --> 27:23.103
Well, gotta be
something them girls

27:23.105 --> 27:24.538
took off Nathan Wagner.

27:24.540 --> 27:27.541
Wallet...
maybe his phone...

27:27.543 --> 27:30.477
Oh, yeah. His phone.

27:30.479 --> 27:32.713
She needed his thumbprint
to access his phone.

27:32.715 --> 27:35.816
Well, whatever's on that thing,
Hansen's willing to kill for it.

27:35.818 --> 27:37.684
And she's not gonna stop
until she gets it.

27:37.686 --> 27:40.687
We find those girls,
we find Vanessa Hansen.

27:42.557 --> 27:44.424
All right!

27:45.960 --> 27:47.227
When was this caught?

27:47.229 --> 27:48.428
This morning.

27:48.430 --> 27:51.164
Any fresher you'd be
eating it underwater.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.500
Sure about that?

27:56.671 --> 27:59.806
Choose your next words
carefully, bruddah.

27:59.808 --> 28:01.708
It's okay.

28:01.710 --> 28:03.210
I'm not hungry anyway.

28:03.212 --> 28:04.411
I'm here for a favor.

28:04.413 --> 28:06.647
You <i>are</i> Five-O.

28:06.649 --> 28:09.816
What's going on, man?

28:09.818 --> 28:13.053
There's a, uh, vintage
bookshop in town

28:13.055 --> 28:15.489
that's a cover for a
counterfeiting operation.

28:15.491 --> 28:17.424
That's no joke.

28:17.426 --> 28:20.160
My cousin Bobo used
a home printer and bleach

28:20.162 --> 28:22.129
to turn fives into 50.

28:22.131 --> 28:24.464
Now he's doing 20
up in Halawa.

28:24.466 --> 28:27.434
Let me guess-- he forgot
to change Lincoln to Grant?

28:28.469 --> 28:29.736
You tell McGarrett about this?

28:29.738 --> 28:31.138
Of course, but
he's convinced

28:31.140 --> 28:32.439
there's nothing
going on in there.

28:32.441 --> 28:35.275
Which is why I need
some hard evidence.

28:38.313 --> 28:40.747
I don't read.
I'm more of a visual guy.

28:40.749 --> 28:42.582
It's not for you.
It's my way to get

28:42.584 --> 28:44.885
ears inside the operation.
There's a listening device

28:44.887 --> 28:45.953
implanted in the spine.

28:45.955 --> 28:47.721
I just need someone to
walk into that store

28:47.723 --> 28:49.556
and sell it for me.

28:52.060 --> 28:55.329
How do you know they're even
gonna want to buy this thing?

28:55.331 --> 28:57.264
It's not even
in English.

28:57.266 --> 29:00.600
It's Latin, it's rare,
it's worth a grand, easy.

29:00.602 --> 29:03.003
So if you let it go for
a couple hundred bucks,

29:03.005 --> 29:05.072
they're not gonna say no.

29:05.940 --> 29:07.341
You got legs.

29:07.343 --> 29:10.110
I can't do it.
I'm too close to this thing.

29:10.112 --> 29:13.313
I need an op with
undercover experience.

29:13.315 --> 29:15.782
Chin told me you helped
Five-O with a situation

29:15.784 --> 29:17.417
a few years back.

29:17.419 --> 29:20.120
Yeah, and I almost
ended up worm food.

29:20.122 --> 29:22.556
So with all due respect
to my existence,

29:22.558 --> 29:25.325
my various
thriving enterprises,

29:25.327 --> 29:28.428
I'm gonna have to pass.
Sorry, brah.

29:28.430 --> 29:31.498
W-Wait, wait, wait.
Just hear me out.

29:32.900 --> 29:35.068
Have you ever been
sure of something?

29:35.070 --> 29:37.104
Something you knew to be true,

29:37.106 --> 29:39.006
but no one believed you?

29:43.411 --> 29:45.879
Starting my own business.

29:45.881 --> 29:48.415
Going legit.

29:48.417 --> 29:51.451
You should have seen
the looks that I got.

29:51.453 --> 29:54.755
And I'm not just
talking about my friends.

29:55.823 --> 29:59.092
Now I got a truck,

29:59.094 --> 30:02.629
shave ice stand, helicopter,

30:02.631 --> 30:06.533
and a few other tricks
up my sleeve.

30:06.535 --> 30:08.068
There, you see?

30:08.070 --> 30:10.804
I mean, at least you had a
chance to prove everyone wrong.

30:13.976 --> 30:16.143
My dad...

30:16.145 --> 30:18.278
was a brilliant engineer.

30:18.280 --> 30:21.014
All he ever wanted to do
was build things better.

30:21.016 --> 30:23.683
When the company he was
working for started to

30:23.685 --> 30:26.753
take shortcuts and put people
at risk, he went to his boss.

30:26.755 --> 30:28.255
Nothing happened.

30:28.257 --> 30:31.591
Two months later, he went
to the division supervisor.

30:31.593 --> 30:34.261
Same response. Silence.

30:34.263 --> 30:37.264
Four months later, he went to
the president of the company.

30:37.266 --> 30:39.833
And two days after that,
they promoted him.

30:41.803 --> 30:43.737
They paid him to shut up?

30:44.839 --> 30:47.307
My father lived the rest
of his life with the regret

30:47.309 --> 30:50.644
of not having done
the right thing.

30:50.646 --> 30:52.746
I watched how it
ate away at him.

30:52.748 --> 30:55.382
How weak it made him feel.

30:55.384 --> 30:58.585
Compromising his integrity
instead of doing what was right.

31:01.022 --> 31:03.156
I loved my father,

31:03.158 --> 31:05.158
but that's not gonna be me.

31:05.160 --> 31:06.593
I'm not gonna shut up

31:06.595 --> 31:09.763
and I'm not gonna
walk away from this.

31:12.333 --> 31:13.667
I'm in.

31:13.669 --> 31:15.769
Gonna do this.

31:17.772 --> 31:19.139
Thank you.

31:21.008 --> 31:22.709
I don't think
you understand, Lea.

31:22.711 --> 31:24.144
If those people
find Keilani and Alana

31:24.146 --> 31:26.446
before we do,
they're as good as dead.

31:30.184 --> 31:32.652
Okay, look, you stole a cell
phone from the guy who was

31:32.654 --> 31:34.454
killed on the bus
this morning, all right?

31:34.456 --> 31:37.290
Some very dangerous people
are trying to find it.

31:37.292 --> 31:39.025
Is that right?

31:41.696 --> 31:43.763
Lea...

31:43.765 --> 31:46.133
you recognize this place?

31:46.135 --> 31:48.235
That guy was tearing
apart your house.

31:48.237 --> 31:50.937
And he wasn't the type
to surrender, okay?

31:50.939 --> 31:52.739
Now, if your two friends

31:52.741 --> 31:54.241
had shown up instead of us,

31:54.243 --> 31:56.610
it would've been
them in that photo.

31:56.612 --> 31:57.978
These people

31:57.980 --> 32:00.347
will not hesitate to kill
to get what they're after,

32:00.349 --> 32:01.815
so if you know
where your friends are,

32:01.817 --> 32:03.984
you need to tell us.

32:12.426 --> 32:15.662
Keilani's tutu has a house
up in Waimanalo.

32:17.598 --> 32:20.300
We always said if things
went bad, that's where we'd go.

32:32.413 --> 32:34.614
Would you please sit down.

32:34.616 --> 32:37.217
You're stressing me out.

32:37.219 --> 32:39.452
Pardon me for being human.
I killed a guy today.

32:39.454 --> 32:41.488
It was his idea
to play hero.

32:41.490 --> 32:44.191
It was either him or you.
Doesn't matter.

32:44.193 --> 32:46.560
Dead is dead.
And the cops know who we are.

32:46.562 --> 32:48.795
So yeah, I'm a little stressed.
We're gonna be fine.

32:48.796 --> 32:49.886
They got Lea.

32:49.910 --> 32:51.974
Relax. She's not gonna
tell the cops anything.

32:54.068 --> 32:55.869
Sit down.

32:55.871 --> 32:57.204
I said sit down!

33:02.843 --> 33:05.445
Good. Now that I have
your attention...

33:05.447 --> 33:07.080
I want the stuff you stole
this morning.

33:22.663 --> 33:24.497
Where's the rest of it?

33:24.499 --> 33:27.100
Huh?
I don't know...

34:03.247 --> 34:06.249
Gun! Second story!
Got it.

34:16.952 --> 34:19.462
Stay down!

34:25.205 --> 34:28.474
Take another step
and she dies.

34:28.476 --> 34:30.175
From the looks
of that wound,

34:30.177 --> 34:32.744
she's already got one
foot in the grave.

34:32.746 --> 34:34.980
The way she's leaking blood, I give her
about ten minutes before it's both.

34:34.982 --> 34:36.288
I will put a bullet
in her head right now.

34:37.284 --> 34:39.051
Go ahead.

34:39.053 --> 34:41.487
We don't give a damn about her.
Or you.

34:41.489 --> 34:44.456
I'll tell you what,

34:44.458 --> 34:47.525
when she's done bleeding out,
why don't you come out front

34:47.527 --> 34:48.893
and we'll talk, all right?

35:15.388 --> 35:17.990
I got her.

35:17.992 --> 35:20.192
I'm going inside.

35:24.497 --> 35:26.365
Central, this is
Captain Grover, Five-O.

35:26.367 --> 35:28.834
I have a shooting victim,
heavy bleeder, conscious.

35:28.836 --> 35:29.801
I need a medevac.

35:29.803 --> 35:31.436
Put a rush on it.

35:41.381 --> 35:42.814
<i>So it turns out</i>

35:42.816 --> 35:45.817
that one of Nathan Wagner's
clients was Union Liberty Bank.

35:45.819 --> 35:47.786
He managed the data
transfer codes,

35:47.788 --> 35:50.088
which he kept stored on his phone.
What?!

35:50.090 --> 35:52.024
Well, that doesn't seem
like a very savvy way

35:52.026 --> 35:54.826
to secure valuable information,
especially for a tech guy.

35:54.828 --> 35:56.328
Yeah, but this wasn't
just any phone--

35:56.330 --> 35:57.930
it was equipped
with a state-of-the-art firewall

35:57.932 --> 35:59.498
that made it resistant
to hacking.

35:59.500 --> 36:01.900
The only way in
was his thumbprint.

36:01.902 --> 36:03.569
Vanessa Hansen was
gonna use those codes

36:03.571 --> 36:05.037
to drain millions
from the bank.

36:05.039 --> 36:06.677
Well, that would explain
why Wagner put up a fight.

36:06.701 --> 36:08.041
Mmm.

36:08.042 --> 36:11.243
So she said she followed him
from the hotel to the bus...

36:12.312 --> 36:14.146
<i>...put a gun in his side,</i>
<i>said "We're gonna</i>

36:14.148 --> 36:16.448
<i>get off in a few stops,"</i>
<i>where there was a car waiting</i>

36:16.450 --> 36:17.616
<i>with a laptop inside</i>

36:17.618 --> 36:20.485
to do a wire transfer
to an offshore account.

36:20.487 --> 36:23.355
Those girls had no idea
what they were walking into

36:23.357 --> 36:24.856
when they got onto that bus.

36:27.827 --> 36:31.063
For them, life as they knew it
<i>was simple.</i>

36:31.065 --> 36:33.198
<i>It was waking up every day</i>

36:33.200 --> 36:34.766
<i>with a desire</i>
<i>to catch a better wave</i>

36:34.768 --> 36:38.036
<i>than the day before.</i>

36:38.038 --> 36:40.439
<i>The adrenaline you feel</i>
<i>paddling out knowing</i>

36:40.441 --> 36:43.675
that at any time you could get
<i>the ride of your life.</i>

36:46.145 --> 36:49.448
<i>And then there's the rush</i>
<i>of walking on water.</i>

36:49.450 --> 36:51.683
<i>Only gods do that.</i>

36:53.486 --> 36:56.388
<i>Everything they did was</i>
<i>to preserve that life.</i>

36:56.390 --> 36:58.523
<i>To surf is to get up</i>

36:58.525 --> 37:00.292
<i>every day with a desire</i>
<i>to battle something</i>

37:00.294 --> 37:01.760
<i>greater than yourself.</i>

37:01.762 --> 37:04.730
<i>And those girls just wanted</i>
<i>to ride that wave</i>

37:04.732 --> 37:07.099
<i>as long as they could.</i>

37:07.101 --> 37:11.370
<i>And now their endless summer</i>
<i>is over.</i>

37:20.913 --> 37:22.547
Hey. Come in.

37:23.383 --> 37:26.418
Heard you solved the case.

37:26.420 --> 37:27.853
Kudos.

37:27.855 --> 37:28.920
Yeah, thanks, man.

37:28.922 --> 37:30.989
Uh, thanks for
coming by, too.

37:30.991 --> 37:32.257
Look, I, um...

37:32.259 --> 37:34.359
I felt bad about the way
we left things this morning,

37:34.361 --> 37:35.560
so I called in a favor.

37:35.562 --> 37:37.996
I had my friend

37:37.998 --> 37:39.631
at Secret Service
run Thomas Farrow

37:39.633 --> 37:40.953
through their
counterfeiting unit.

37:42.702 --> 37:46.571
I'm sorry, but, uh,
he's clean, Jerry.

37:48.708 --> 37:51.743
Well, I guess no one's right
100% of the time.

37:51.745 --> 37:54.579
You bet.

37:54.581 --> 37:57.783
Can I ask you something?
Of course.

37:57.785 --> 37:59.217
Do you think I'm a crackpot?

37:59.219 --> 38:01.953
No. Absolutely not.

38:01.955 --> 38:04.723
Listen, you've been right
about so many things:

38:04.725 --> 38:05.991
the Medici rings,

38:05.993 --> 38:07.626
the black unicorn,
my Champ Box...

38:07.628 --> 38:11.096
Yeah, well, not that
I'm keeping score or anything.

38:11.098 --> 38:12.698
Yeah, but we are, Jerry.

38:12.700 --> 38:15.167
You've become an incredible
asset to this team.

38:15.169 --> 38:18.070
I don't want you getting in trouble
over something stupid like this.

38:18.072 --> 38:19.137
You know?

38:19.139 --> 38:21.173
You're <i>'ohana</i> now.

38:21.175 --> 38:23.408
Bring it in, man.
Come on.

38:28.414 --> 38:30.248
Thanks for this, McGruff.

38:30.250 --> 38:32.484
Glad I could put your mind
at ease.

38:47.333 --> 38:50.202
It's on.

38:54.374 --> 38:55.974
Good evening, sir.

38:55.976 --> 38:57.776
Can I help you with something?

38:57.778 --> 39:02.147
My uncle
passed away recently.

39:02.149 --> 39:04.416
I found this in his attic.

39:04.418 --> 39:07.419
Looks like
it might be worth something.

39:08.254 --> 39:10.155
Ah.

39:10.157 --> 39:12.591
Lecanto's
<i>Doctrinam DE Homine,</i>

39:12.593 --> 39:14.760
originally
published in 1590.

39:14.762 --> 39:17.295
This looks to be an
early 17th century edition

39:17.297 --> 39:20.832
with, uh, quarter vellum
and speckled paper sides.

39:20.834 --> 39:25.337
Well, your uncle had
most excellent taste.

39:25.339 --> 39:26.838
Thanks.

39:26.840 --> 39:28.907
Now, how much for the book?

39:28.909 --> 39:32.711
Well, um, it's certainly
a strong copy

39:32.713 --> 39:34.780
with a very pleasing
provenance.

39:34.782 --> 39:37.716
Um...

39:37.718 --> 39:39.017
May I handle it?

39:39.019 --> 39:41.420
Absolutely.

39:44.457 --> 39:46.391
Just be careful with it, brah.

39:46.393 --> 39:48.126
I certainly will.

40:00.173 --> 40:04.443
All those provinces good, brah?

40:04.445 --> 40:06.278
Most impressive.

40:07.780 --> 40:10.749
Well, then, um...

40:10.751 --> 40:14.119
I am prepared
to offer you...

40:14.121 --> 40:16.021
$300.

40:18.057 --> 40:19.991
I'm prepared to accept...

40:19.993 --> 40:22.694
no less than $400.

40:22.696 --> 40:26.364
Hmm. You drive rather
a hard bargain, sir.

40:26.366 --> 40:29.701
You have yourself a deal.

40:29.703 --> 40:30.936
Cheers.

40:30.938 --> 40:32.838
Mahalo, brother.

40:37.711 --> 40:40.278
<i>Hey.</i>

40:40.280 --> 40:43.281
Hey. I tried calling you before.
You didn't pick up.

40:43.283 --> 40:44.483
What's going on?
What happened with Reyes?

40:44.485 --> 40:45.450
He gave me

40:45.452 --> 40:47.219
till Monday
to-to get him his money,

40:47.221 --> 40:49.721
and, Steve, I do not think
that he is... he's lying.

40:49.723 --> 40:52.757
I think that, um...
I think he has Matt.

40:52.759 --> 40:54.493
Okay.

40:54.495 --> 40:57.229
Then, uh, I vote we go
to Colombia and get him back.

40:57.231 --> 40:58.964
No, that we can't do,
all right?

40:58.966 --> 41:00.966
This guy Reyes is the type
of guy I think he is,

41:00.968 --> 41:02.901
uh, he's gonna have an army
around him.

41:02.903 --> 41:06.071
If we go down there, Matt's dead
before we get in the front door.

41:06.073 --> 41:09.007
But, uh, I think I may have

41:09.009 --> 41:11.743
a-a... another way
of getting Matt back.

41:11.745 --> 41:13.278
How's that?

41:13.280 --> 41:15.747
How? Uh, I pay him his money.

41:15.749 --> 41:18.416
You mean the money that doesn't exist?
You say it doesn't exist.

41:18.418 --> 41:20.819
I'm starting to think
that maybe it does.

41:20.821 --> 41:23.388
In fact, I'm thinking
it's right here on this island.

41:23.390 --> 41:24.489
Now, wait, what are you
talking about?

41:24.491 --> 41:25.724
Just stick with me here
for a second.

41:25.726 --> 41:27.659
Three years ago,
Matt gets on that plane.

41:27.661 --> 41:29.628
Okay? Not a single piece
of luggage.

41:29.630 --> 41:31.463
But he's supposed
to have $18.5 million.

41:31.465 --> 41:33.164
If that's the case,
then it's here on the island.

41:33.166 --> 41:35.233
Correct?
Okay.

41:35.235 --> 41:38.837
So, say he did-- so what?
How are you supposed to find it?

41:38.839 --> 41:39.905
About a month
after he disappeared,

41:39.907 --> 41:41.940
he sent me a postcard-- Matt.

41:41.942 --> 41:43.074
Yeah? What'd it say?
Did it mention the money?

41:43.076 --> 41:44.509
No, he didn't mention the money.

41:44.511 --> 41:45.944
He just wrote
"Wish you were here."

41:45.946 --> 41:48.346
It's a picture
of this remote area on Oahu.

41:48.348 --> 41:50.882
"Wish you were here"
with a rock formation

41:50.884 --> 41:52.651
and a couple of...
couple of palm trees.

41:52.653 --> 41:55.754
Hold on. I'm gonna take
a picture. Hold on.

42:01.260 --> 42:03.228
Did you get it?
"Wish you were here."

42:03.230 --> 42:04.963
So at first,
I'm just angry, right?

42:04.965 --> 42:06.498
I mean, this is all
this guy's got to say

42:06.500 --> 42:08.033
after everything that happened?
"I wish you were here"?

42:08.035 --> 42:09.601
That's all I get?
You know, I was confused.

42:09.603 --> 42:11.002
I don't understand
why he sent it.

42:11.004 --> 42:12.437
Then I looked at it again today.

42:12.439 --> 42:14.406
It started to make
a little bit more sense.

42:14.408 --> 42:16.575
Maybe he was sending me
the postcard to tell me

42:16.577 --> 42:17.776
where the location
of the money is.

42:17.778 --> 42:19.544
Danny...

42:19.546 --> 42:20.912
I know, I know, I know.

42:20.914 --> 42:22.147
I'm crazy, right?

42:22.149 --> 42:24.282
But I think literally
that the money could be

42:24.284 --> 42:26.217
directly at the spot
on the postcard.

42:26.219 --> 42:27.485
Okay, so wait a minute,

42:27.487 --> 42:30.355
you think this whole postcard
is-is some kind of a...

42:30.357 --> 42:32.591
Is a treasure map, yes.
Uh, I know.

42:32.593 --> 42:33.992
Go ahead. Say it. I'm crazy.

42:33.994 --> 42:36.127
No, I'm not gonna do that.
I appreciate that.

42:36.129 --> 42:37.228
Hey, Danny,

42:37.230 --> 42:38.863
listen to me,
I know where this place is.

42:38.865 --> 42:40.265
I can be there
in less than two hours

42:40.267 --> 42:41.399
to come help you dig it up.

42:41.401 --> 42:42.934
No, no, no, no, no, no.

42:42.936 --> 42:44.035
Don't worry about it. Listen...

42:44.037 --> 42:45.403
I'm already here,
and it might be nothing.

42:45.405 --> 42:46.671
All right?
All right, well,

42:46.673 --> 42:48.006
if you find something,
give me a call.

42:48.008 --> 42:49.207
All right, you got it.
