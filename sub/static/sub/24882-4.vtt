01:15.200 --> 01:16.467
Elmo:
Ha ha ha!

01:16.467 --> 01:18.100
Nina:
"And then the Prince said...

01:18.100 --> 01:22.100
All:
'Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
let down your hair.'"

01:23.567 --> 01:26.367
Oh, hi, and welcome
to "Sesame Street."

01:26.367 --> 01:28.200
Hi there.

01:28.200 --> 01:32.467
Elmo, Abby, and Nina were
just reading a fairy tale.

01:32.467 --> 01:33.567
- Mm-hmm.
- "Rapunzel."

01:33.567 --> 01:35.233
Yeah. That's right.

01:35.233 --> 01:36.834
"Rapunzel's" a story
about a girl

01:36.834 --> 01:38.700
who's been locked away
in a tower.

01:38.700 --> 01:40.600
Abby:
Yep, but there's a prince,

01:40.600 --> 01:43.467
and when he comes
to rescue her, he says...

01:43.467 --> 01:48.066
All:
"Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
let down your hair!"

01:49.967 --> 01:53.734
And then Rapunzel's hair
comes tumbling out the window,

01:53.734 --> 01:56.567
and the Prince climbs up
to rescue her.

01:56.567 --> 01:58.100
Oh, oh, oh!

01:58.100 --> 02:00.800
Nina, can you read
the "Rapunzel, Rapunzel"
part again?

02:00.800 --> 02:02.033
That's Elmo's favorite.

02:02.033 --> 02:04.600
Sure.
So here's the Prince.

02:04.600 --> 02:05.667
Elmo:
That's right. Uh-huh.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.867
He goes up to the tower,
and he says...

02:07.867 --> 02:12.700
All:
"Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
let down your hair."

02:12.700 --> 02:14.200
- Ha ha ha.
- Ha ha ha!

02:14.200 --> 02:15.800
- Huh?
- Huh?

02:15.800 --> 02:17.800
- Wha?
- Huh?

02:17.800 --> 02:19.533
What? What happened?

02:19.533 --> 02:22.266
Abby:
Rapunzel didn't
let down her hair.

02:22.266 --> 02:23.700
I've never seen
anything like this.

02:23.700 --> 02:25.600
How could the story
just change?

02:25.600 --> 02:27.300
Well, uh, maybe--

02:27.300 --> 02:29.233
maybe something's wrong
in Fairy Tale Land.

02:29.233 --> 02:30.333
Abby:
Yeah.

02:30.333 --> 02:31.867
Well, Abby,
you're a fairy.

02:31.867 --> 02:33.500
Maybe you could figure out
what happened to the story.

02:33.500 --> 02:34.967
Oh, yeah.
Elmo will help you.

02:34.967 --> 02:36.834
Oh, you will?

02:36.834 --> 02:38.667
Oh, well,
of course, Abby.

02:38.667 --> 02:41.734
Oh! Friends help friends
fix fairy tales.

02:41.734 --> 02:43.200
Nina:
That's right.

02:43.200 --> 02:44.734
You can be
the Fairy Tale Helpers.

02:44.734 --> 02:46.734
- Yeah.
- Ahh! Yeah.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.600
Okay, Elmo,
grab my hand.

02:48.600 --> 02:50.433
- Okay.
- Okay.

02:50.433 --> 02:53.667
We'll travel together,
hand in hand.

02:53.667 --> 02:57.367
Off we go
to Fairy Tale Land.

02:57.367 --> 02:59.200
Zippity-zap!

03:01.834 --> 03:04.367
You did it.
Good luck.

03:04.367 --> 03:06.100
¡Buena suerte!

03:09.467 --> 03:13.166
Wow! Oh, look,
we're in Fairy Tale Land.

03:13.166 --> 03:16.500
Fairies and monsters
poofing out of thin air.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.433
I don't know what's
going on here anymore.

03:18.433 --> 03:19.834
Oh, my.

03:19.834 --> 03:22.367
Hi, Mr. Prince.
I'm Abby Cadabby.

03:22.367 --> 03:23.767
I'm a fairy-in-training.

03:23.767 --> 03:25.467
And this is my friend Elmo.

03:25.467 --> 03:26.900
Oh,
how do you do, sir?

03:26.900 --> 03:28.600
Yeah, and we're here
to help you.

03:28.600 --> 03:31.800
Oh, well,
you're just in time.

03:31.800 --> 03:33.533
It's Rapunzel.

03:33.533 --> 03:36.400
She won't
let down her hair.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.367
Don't worry,
Mr. Prince.

03:38.367 --> 03:40.600
Elmo and I will
figure out what's wrong

03:40.600 --> 03:42.133
and we'll fix it.

03:42.133 --> 03:44.567
Because we are...

03:44.567 --> 03:47.467
Abby and Elmo:
The Fairy Tale Helpers.

03:47.467 --> 03:50.633
Ohh!
Fairy Tale Helpers?

03:50.633 --> 03:52.400
- Wonderful.
- Uh-huh.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.900
And while you do that,

03:54.900 --> 03:57.834
I'll find out if there's
another way into the tower.

03:57.834 --> 03:59.667
Elmo:
Oh! Ha ha ha!

03:59.667 --> 04:01.166
- Good idea!
- Ha ha ha!

04:01.166 --> 04:03.166
Okay, all right, Elmo,
grab my hand.

04:03.166 --> 04:04.734
- Okay.
- Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

04:04.734 --> 04:07.533
Rapunzel, Rapunzel
won't let down her hair,

04:07.533 --> 04:09.800
so poof
the Fairy Tale Helpers

04:09.800 --> 04:12.266
from here to there.

04:12.266 --> 04:13.667
Zippity-zap!

04:13.667 --> 04:15.233
- Oh!
- Ha ha ha!

04:15.233 --> 04:18.266
Wow!
Look at all this hair.

04:18.266 --> 04:20.700
Ha ha ha!
Uh, Rapunzel!

04:20.700 --> 04:22.233
Yo, Rapunzel!

04:22.233 --> 04:23.367
Oh.

04:23.367 --> 04:25.600
Hey, Abby,

04:25.600 --> 04:28.333
maybe if we follow
( spits ) the hair,

04:28.333 --> 04:30.133
we can find Rapunzel.

04:30.133 --> 04:31.600
Good idea.

04:31.600 --> 04:34.533
Rapunzel:
¡Hola!  Over here.

04:34.533 --> 04:36.800
Rapunzel,
is that you?

04:36.800 --> 04:39.533
Ooh! Yes, I'm stuck.

04:39.533 --> 04:42.533
Oh, Elmo, we're gonna
need your help.

04:42.533 --> 04:44.767
Pfft! Okay. Ha ha.

04:44.767 --> 04:46.467
- Elmo: Okay, ready?
- Rapunzel: Uh-huh.

04:46.467 --> 04:49.734
One, two, three!

04:49.734 --> 04:51.734
Ha ha ha!

04:51.734 --> 04:55.133
Oh! Oh, gracias.

04:55.133 --> 04:58.100
Oh, I thought
I was going to-- uhh--

04:58.100 --> 05:02.133
be trapped
in my own hair forever.

05:02.133 --> 05:03.934
Oh, well,
what happened?

05:03.934 --> 05:05.200
I started flipping,

05:05.200 --> 05:07.133
and, well,
before you know,

05:07.133 --> 05:09.066
I got twisted up.

05:09.066 --> 05:11.000
Wait, wait, wait.
Flipping?

05:11.000 --> 05:12.600
Yeah, that's right.

05:12.600 --> 05:16.600
You know,
my favorite thing
to do is gymnastics.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.734
- Ohh!
- Gymnastics?

05:18.734 --> 05:21.166
Yeah, you know,
jumping and tumbling

05:21.166 --> 05:24.100
and flipping all around
like this.

05:24.100 --> 05:25.633
Whee!

05:25.633 --> 05:27.900
- Wow! Oh, Rapunzel. Rapunzel.
- Rapunzel: Oh! Ow! Whoopsie.

05:27.900 --> 05:30.333
- Elmo: Are you okay?
- Rapunzel: Uhh!

05:30.333 --> 05:32.367
The problem is
all this hair

05:32.367 --> 05:35.433
really cramps my--
uhh-- flip.

05:35.433 --> 05:37.800
Yeah, it looks like
all that hair keeps Rapunzel

05:37.800 --> 05:39.600
from doing gymnastics.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.800
Yeah. Hey, uh,
what if you got a haircut?

05:42.800 --> 05:46.600
Well, I would,
but I cannot exactly escape

05:46.600 --> 05:48.633
and go to the hairdresser.

05:48.633 --> 05:50.567
No...

05:50.567 --> 05:53.700
but maybe we can bring
one to you.

05:53.700 --> 05:55.166
- Oh, ah, ha, ha!
- Ha, ha!

05:55.166 --> 05:56.266
What do you mean?

05:56.266 --> 05:57.734
- Hang on.
- Huh?

05:57.734 --> 05:59.333
Ahem. Ahh.

05:59.333 --> 06:01.734
Help Rapunzel be a flipper.

06:01.734 --> 06:04.467
Bring an expert
with a clipper.

06:04.467 --> 06:06.667
Zippity-zap.

06:06.667 --> 06:07.734
- Oh, oh.
- Ohh.

06:07.734 --> 06:09.467
You rang?

06:09.467 --> 06:11.000
Who are you?

06:11.000 --> 06:15.100
Ooh, I am Fairy Tale Land's
preeminent coiffeur.

06:15.100 --> 06:16.600
Huh?

06:16.600 --> 06:18.700
- I am a hairdresser.
- Of course!

06:18.700 --> 06:20.266
How would you
like it cut, huh?

06:20.266 --> 06:22.633
Oh, nice and short,
please.

06:22.633 --> 06:26.300
Yes, I want a haircut that
really fits my active lifestyle.

06:26.300 --> 06:28.567
One that is good
for flipping and jumping.

06:28.567 --> 06:30.100
No problem.

06:30.100 --> 06:31.734
Oh, wait-- wait--
wait a minute.

06:31.734 --> 06:33.500
- Wait a minute.
- What?

06:33.500 --> 06:36.166
- What? What?
- I cannot cut my hair.

06:36.166 --> 06:37.433
( sputters )
Wha?

06:37.433 --> 06:38.767
Well,
what's the matter?

06:38.767 --> 06:41.567
There's no stairway
in this place.

06:41.567 --> 06:43.567
Climbing my hair--
pfft--

06:43.567 --> 06:45.300
is the only way up.

06:45.300 --> 06:46.767
- Oh!
- Ahh.

06:46.767 --> 06:48.600
So if you cut
your hair--

06:48.600 --> 06:51.400
Yeah,
then Rapunzel's friends
won't be able to visit.

06:51.400 --> 06:54.066
- Ahh.
- Exactamente.

06:54.066 --> 06:55.633
How do we solve
this problem

06:55.633 --> 06:58.333
so that I can be
what I want to be,

06:58.333 --> 07:02.233
a gymnast, and still have
my friends come visit?

07:02.233 --> 07:04.934
Hmm.
I can fix that.

07:04.934 --> 07:06.266
- You can?
- Mm-hmm.

07:06.266 --> 07:07.433
How?

07:07.433 --> 07:10.000
Wait and see.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.867
I know how I'll get
into the tower.

07:13.867 --> 07:16.600
I'll simply launch
myself up there

07:16.600 --> 07:19.400
using this cannon.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.734
Hmm. Wha? What is this?

07:21.734 --> 07:23.900
Ahh! A ladder...

07:23.900 --> 07:26.500
made of hair?

07:26.500 --> 07:28.667
Well, that is much easier.

07:28.667 --> 07:32.233
Hmm. Uhh. Uhh.

07:32.233 --> 07:35.667
Uhh! ( grunts )

07:35.667 --> 07:39.433
Rapun... zel. Oop.

07:39.433 --> 07:43.700
Ahh. Rapunzel!

07:43.700 --> 07:47.400
What have you done
to your hair?

07:47.400 --> 07:50.367
I cut it.
Do you like it?

07:50.367 --> 07:52.700
Like it?

07:52.700 --> 07:54.834
I love it!

07:54.834 --> 07:58.633
Now you can flip and flop
the way you like.

07:58.633 --> 08:00.700
Why didn't
you do it sooner?

08:00.700 --> 08:03.834
Because you needed
a way up. Hmm.

08:03.834 --> 08:05.367
Oh, right.

08:05.367 --> 08:07.667
Luckily,
the hairdresser

08:07.667 --> 08:10.533
is also an expert braider.

08:10.533 --> 08:12.033
Hello.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.333
Yeah, he made my old hair
into a ladder

08:14.333 --> 08:17.800
so we can climb up and down
whenever we like.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.133
- Ha ha!
- Oh!

08:19.133 --> 08:22.467
I can be what
I want to be, a gymnast.

08:22.467 --> 08:25.433
I don't have to wait
anymore because...

08:25.433 --> 08:28.967
♪ I get to choose
what I want to be ♪

08:31.066 --> 08:35.066
♪ Don't need someone
to rescue me ♪

08:35.066 --> 08:38.400
♪ I can be whatever
I want to be ♪

08:39.500 --> 08:42.333
Come on, everyone.
Flip with me.

08:42.333 --> 08:44.100
Wow!

08:44.100 --> 08:47.400
All:
♪ I get to choose
what I want to be ♪

08:47.400 --> 08:49.100
Yeah!

08:49.100 --> 08:52.667
All:
♪ Don't need someone
to rescue me ♪

08:54.266 --> 08:58.300
♪ I can be whatever
I want to be. ♪

08:58.300 --> 09:00.333
- Yes!
- Ha ha ha!

09:00.333 --> 09:03.066
Now we just need
to fix your fairy tale

09:03.066 --> 09:05.066
to fit the new you.

09:05.066 --> 09:09.700
Actually,
this may sound surprising,
but I've always thought

09:09.700 --> 09:11.967
I would make
a terrific gymnast, too.

09:11.967 --> 09:13.100
Elmo:
Oh, ha ha ha!

09:13.100 --> 09:15.467
Oh, let's change
both our stories.

09:15.467 --> 09:17.033
Well, certainly.

09:17.033 --> 09:19.333
We can be
what we want to be.

09:19.333 --> 09:20.367
Yes.

09:20.367 --> 09:23.333
Thank you,
Fairy Tale Helpers.

09:23.333 --> 09:24.967
Oh, happy to help.

09:24.967 --> 09:27.367
- What do we do?
- Let's go, Elmo.

09:27.367 --> 09:31.200
- Ha ha ha.
- They flipped and flopped
and landed on their feet,

09:31.200 --> 09:34.600
so let's get back
to "Sesame Street."

09:34.600 --> 09:37.333
Zippity-zap!

09:37.333 --> 09:39.367
"And they flipped
happily ever after."

09:39.367 --> 09:40.600
- Yay!
- Ha ha ha!

09:40.600 --> 09:42.834
Wow, it worked.

09:42.834 --> 09:44.233
You guys did
a really good job,

09:44.233 --> 09:46.000
and Rapunzel and the Prince
seem really happy

09:46.000 --> 09:47.500
now that they can be
what they want to be.

15:10.934 --> 15:13.967
First,
the oats are steamed,

15:13.967 --> 15:17.100
and then they go through
rollers to flatten them.

15:22.133 --> 15:24.000
Then they're toasted.

15:26.166 --> 15:30.433
Then put into containers
to ship off to grocery stores.

Once upon a time
in a castle far away,

18:35.367 --> 18:38.166
there were
ten brave knights.

Let's count them.

Ten knights.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.333
( roaring )

18:53.333 --> 18:55.066
Boy:
What was that sound?

18:58.033 --> 19:00.033
It's a dragon,

19:00.033 --> 19:01.867
and he looks angry.

19:01.867 --> 19:04.033
He's heading straight
for the castle.

19:05.400 --> 19:08.533
He has to climb ten hills
to get there.

19:08.533 --> 19:12.400
One, two, three,

19:12.400 --> 19:16.033

Boy:
The dragon wasn't angry,
he was just hungry.

19:36.066 --> 19:40.133
So the knights fed him
ten turkey legs.

19:51.700 --> 19:53.233

Ten turkey legs.

( burping )

19:56.233 --> 19:59.200
Boy:
"Excuse me,"
said the dragon.

19:59.200 --> 20:04.333
The dragon wasn't hungry
anymore, he was happy.

20:04.333 --> 20:08.000
And they all lived
happily ever after.

20:26.100 --> 20:28.433
Welcome to "Elmo's World"!

20:28.433 --> 20:32.700
Oh, guess what Elmo
is wondering about today.

20:32.700 --> 20:34.567
Wait for it.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.400
Wai-ai-ait for it!

20:38.500 --> 20:41.800
Ahh, hey, hey.
Fairy tales.

20:41.800 --> 20:46.166
Oh, ha ha ha.
Here's Goldilocks
and the three bears.

20:46.166 --> 20:47.633
Oh, how's the porridge?

20:47.633 --> 20:49.100
Just right,
Elmo.

20:49.100 --> 20:50.400
Ha ha ha!

20:50.400 --> 20:52.834
Boy,
Elmo loves fairy tales

20:52.834 --> 20:55.900
and wants to find out
more about them.

20:55.900 --> 20:59.800
Ha hey! Let's ask
Elmo's friend, Smartie.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.734
Let's call her together.

21:01.734 --> 21:04.800
Elmo and kids:
♪ Oh, Smartie! ♪

21:04.800 --> 21:07.533
( chimes play "Elmo's Song" )

21:07.533 --> 21:09.200
Hiya, Elmo.

21:09.200 --> 21:11.533
Look, I'm dressed
like a knight

21:11.533 --> 21:14.433
from my favorite
fairy tales.

21:14.433 --> 21:17.767
Ooh, I'm ready
for adventure.

21:17.767 --> 21:19.500
Oh, well,
that's perfect, Smartie,

21:19.500 --> 21:23.266
because Elmo wants to learn
more about fairy tales today.

21:23.266 --> 21:26.333
Well, what do we do
to learn something new?

21:26.333 --> 21:29.300
All:
We look it up.

21:29.300 --> 21:30.633
Here we go.

21:30.633 --> 21:35.200
Once upon a time,
there were fairy tales.

21:35.200 --> 21:37.200
Fairy tales
are made-up stories.

21:37.200 --> 21:39.066
Sometimes
they're about heroes

21:39.066 --> 21:41.000
with exciting
and funny characters

21:41.000 --> 21:43.066
like the seven dwarfs,

21:43.066 --> 21:44.800
or even giants.

21:44.800 --> 21:48.066
Fairy tales can be in books,

21:48.066 --> 21:50.433
or you can pretend
you're in one.

21:50.433 --> 21:54.700
And best of all, they end
happily ever after.

21:54.700 --> 21:56.367
Whoa! Ha ha!

21:56.367 --> 21:59.266
Fairy tales are amazing.

21:59.266 --> 22:01.433
I'm late for a date
with a dragon.

22:01.433 --> 22:03.166
- See ya.
- Oh, ha ha ha!

22:03.166 --> 22:05.934
Thank you, Smartie.
Bye-bye.

22:05.934 --> 22:10.734
Boy, Elmo loves all
the different kinds
of fairy tales.

22:10.734 --> 22:14.600
Hey, that gives Elmo
an idea.

22:14.600 --> 22:17.400
Oh, come on, let's play
a game together.

22:17.400 --> 22:19.934
Yeah! Come on, come on.

22:23.300 --> 22:25.734
Elmo:
Okay, everybody,
let's help Jack

22:25.734 --> 22:28.033
get the golden egg
down the beanstalk

22:28.033 --> 22:29.700
and back home.

22:29.700 --> 22:31.633
Now, which way should
Jack go first?

22:31.633 --> 22:34.333
Kid:
Down. Go down.

22:34.333 --> 22:36.200
Kid #2:
Go that way, Jack.

22:36.200 --> 22:37.700
Elmo:
Not that way.

22:37.700 --> 22:39.333
Turn around.

22:39.333 --> 22:41.433
Kid:
Keep going down.

22:41.433 --> 22:43.667
Kid #2:
That's right, go down.

22:43.667 --> 22:45.200
He's doing it.

22:45.200 --> 22:46.800
Elmo:
Now which way
should Jack go?

22:46.800 --> 22:49.767
Kid:
Go between
the yellow flowers.

22:49.767 --> 22:51.200
Kid #2:
That's it.

22:51.200 --> 22:52.600
Almost there.

22:52.600 --> 22:53.734
Elmo:
We did it!

22:53.734 --> 22:55.100
Yay!

22:55.100 --> 22:57.633
Boy, Elmo loves
happy endings.

22:57.633 --> 23:01.333
Oh, and that makes
Elmo wonder even more.

23:01.333 --> 23:04.600
Oh, does Mr. Noodle
know any fairy tales?

23:04.600 --> 23:06.333
Ooh, let's ask him.

23:06.333 --> 23:09.400
- Elmo: Hey, Mr. Noodle!
- Kids: Mr. Noodle!

23:09.400 --> 23:12.333
Hey, it's
Mr. Noodle's sister,

23:12.333 --> 23:13.767
Ms. Noodle.

23:13.767 --> 23:16.000
Hi, Ms. Noodle.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.600
Oh, Ms. Noodle,
Elmo's wondering,

23:18.600 --> 23:21.633
do you know the fairy tale
"Jack and the Beanstalk"?

23:21.633 --> 23:23.967
You do? Oh, good.

23:23.967 --> 23:26.734
Can you show us how Jack
visits the giant's house

23:26.734 --> 23:28.667
in the fairy tale,
Ms. Noodle?

23:28.667 --> 23:31.567
Kids:
Yeah, show us how.

23:31.567 --> 23:32.600
( horse neighing )

23:32.600 --> 23:34.533
Elmo:
Ms. Noodle,

23:34.533 --> 23:37.200
that's not how Jack
reaches the giant.

23:37.200 --> 23:38.767
Okay, Elmo's gonna
give you a hint.

23:38.767 --> 23:41.600
Jack has to go
very high in the air

23:41.600 --> 23:43.767
to visit
the giant's house.

23:43.767 --> 23:45.734
Okay?

23:45.734 --> 23:48.500
Kid:
She's trying to fly.

23:48.500 --> 23:50.667
Elmo:
Is that how Jack gets
to the giant's house

23:50.667 --> 23:52.633
in the fairy tale,
Ms. Noodle?

23:52.633 --> 23:54.800
Kid:
No, that's not right.

23:54.800 --> 23:57.200
Elmo:
Show us how Jack visits
the giant

23:57.200 --> 24:00.500
in "Jack and the Beanstalk."

24:00.500 --> 24:01.834
Right, right.

24:01.834 --> 24:03.467
Oh, what does she have?

24:03.467 --> 24:05.633
Looks like a lot of dirt.

24:05.633 --> 24:07.633
What have you got?

24:07.633 --> 24:10.600
Oh, ho ho ho!
Magic beans.

24:10.600 --> 24:13.200
You're so clever.

24:13.200 --> 24:14.467
Sprinkle, sprinkle.

24:17.100 --> 24:19.166
Oh! Wait a minute.

24:19.166 --> 24:21.400
Wait a minute.
Look, look. You see?

24:21.400 --> 24:24.166
Oh, ho ho ho!

24:24.166 --> 24:25.367
Kid:
That's a beanstalk.

24:25.367 --> 24:26.934
Kid #2:
She's going to climb it.

24:26.934 --> 24:28.734
Elmo:
Yeah, that's right,
Ms. Noodle.

24:28.734 --> 24:30.667
You did it.

24:30.667 --> 24:33.900
Jack climbs the beanstalk
to visit the giant's house.

24:33.900 --> 24:35.033
Bye-bye.

24:35.033 --> 24:37.000
Boy, learning new things

24:37.000 --> 24:39.467
