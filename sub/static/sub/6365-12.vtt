00:00.001 --> 00:04.036
<i>Previously on</i> reign:
How did we die, mother?

00:04.038 --> 00:07.006
Henriette: <i>Do to claude</i>
<i>what she did to us.</i>

00:07.008 --> 00:08.774
Claude's a healthy
young woman. It'll take

00:08.776 --> 00:10.676
<i>A lot more poison</i>
<i>to bring her down.</i>

00:10.678 --> 00:12.544
This is what you've been
putting in my soup, isn't it?

00:12.546 --> 00:14.780
Why?
You murdered
your sisters.

00:14.782 --> 00:17.249
Do not betray
your other children.

00:17.251 --> 00:20.319
I realize I can't change
the fact that...

00:20.321 --> 00:22.021
You blame me for
what happened.

00:22.023 --> 00:24.223
I believe that we should
lead separate lives.

00:24.225 --> 00:26.792
The money I gave you was never
going to build a school.

00:26.794 --> 00:30.529
Tell me we didn't fund an
assassination on our king.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.698
There are plans to
have bash legitimized.

00:32.700 --> 00:35.167
You're talking about changing
the line of succession,

00:35.169 --> 00:36.568
And that's
the sort of talk

00:36.570 --> 00:39.238
That gets bastards
and mistresses beheaded.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.106
Give this to queen mary,
but not until tomorrow.

00:41.108 --> 00:43.509
I know I agreed to marry claude
<i>of behalf of France,</i>

00:43.511 --> 00:45.044
<i>But I've realized I can't--</i>

00:45.046 --> 00:46.578
<i>I've fallen in love</i>
<i>with a queen.</i>

00:50.750 --> 00:52.651
Francis:
Mary.

00:54.087 --> 00:55.754
I was wondering
where you were

00:55.756 --> 00:58.123
When you didn't come
for breakfast.

00:58.125 --> 01:00.225
I was weary from my trip.
I've been in my chambers.

01:00.227 --> 01:01.660
Not avoiding me?

01:01.662 --> 01:03.495
It's been two days.

01:03.497 --> 01:05.130
I know that
you want distance,

01:05.132 --> 01:06.799
But we are king
and queen.

01:06.801 --> 01:09.535
I saw you-- the
night I returned.

01:09.537 --> 01:12.171
You were sleeping with lola.

01:12.173 --> 01:14.106
The two of you and your baby.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.077
Well, the baby refused
to sleep for days.

01:18.079 --> 01:19.211
Lola and I were
just exhausted.

01:19.213 --> 01:20.846
There's no need to explain.

01:20.848 --> 01:23.115
I know that there is nothing
untoward going on between you.

01:24.617 --> 01:26.118
But it still hurt

01:26.120 --> 01:28.654
To see you at
peace with them.

01:28.656 --> 01:30.689
Gave me a glimpse of
the happier life you could have.

01:30.691 --> 01:32.424
I want a happier life
with you.

01:34.828 --> 01:36.862
I'm sorry.

01:37.831 --> 01:39.231
It's not you.

01:39.233 --> 01:41.300
If any man comes close,
I-I get uneasy.

01:41.302 --> 01:43.502
I still can't bear
to be touched.

01:43.504 --> 01:45.337
Even the sound of a man
breathing near me...

01:45.339 --> 01:47.706
I wish I knew
how to help.
Just give me time.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.741
All the time you need,
of course.

01:52.812 --> 01:55.180
And how can I help you?

01:55.182 --> 01:57.382
I hear that you've been
parceling out narcisse's land.

01:57.384 --> 01:58.684
That can't be easy.

01:58.686 --> 02:01.220
It's a feeding frenzy,
truth be told.

02:01.222 --> 02:02.888
Impartial advice
is difficult

02:02.890 --> 02:05.791
When every counselor wants
a piece of the prize himself.

02:05.793 --> 02:08.327
I have more lands than
I could ever need.

02:09.429 --> 02:10.562
Perhaps I could help.

02:10.564 --> 02:12.131
I'd love that.

02:12.133 --> 02:13.732
And as you said,

02:13.734 --> 02:16.535
We may be apart, but our
duties still remain.

02:19.906 --> 02:22.641
What took you from our bed
so early this morning?

02:22.643 --> 02:24.209
Francis sent for me.

02:24.211 --> 02:25.611
Ah, did he want you to do

02:25.613 --> 02:27.412
His dark bidding again,
or was it simply

02:27.414 --> 02:29.181
A mÃ©nage Ã  trois
with your sister claude?

02:29.183 --> 02:31.617
Well, he wanted to offer me
lands and a title,

02:31.619 --> 02:33.819
But I said, "my wife wants
a husband with honor,

02:33.821 --> 02:35.254
So I must decline."

02:35.256 --> 02:36.922
That's not funny.

02:36.924 --> 02:38.924
Perhaps not, but it's true.

02:38.926 --> 02:41.460
The lands and
title part anyway.

02:41.462 --> 02:42.661
I wasn't stupid
enough to refuse.

02:42.663 --> 02:43.929
Wait, you're serious?

02:45.198 --> 02:47.299
Really? Oh, bash!

02:47.301 --> 02:48.767
And all this time,
I've been bowing

02:48.769 --> 02:50.502
And scraping
to countesses and barons,

02:50.504 --> 02:53.238
And now you're saying
they can bow to me?

02:53.240 --> 02:54.706
Who will bowing to me,
by the way?

02:54.708 --> 02:56.208
Countesses?
Do we get a duchy?

02:56.210 --> 02:58.177
Are you even aware
you're undressing me?

02:58.179 --> 02:59.611
(babbles)
uh, kenna, uh,
there's other news.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.346
Diane: I'm beginning
to understand

03:01.348 --> 03:03.282
What henry saw in her.

03:03.284 --> 03:05.350
Mother, you're early.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.753
Well, since you're here,
I suppose, uh,

03:07.755 --> 03:10.222
I should formally
present my new wife.

03:10.224 --> 03:12.925
So sorry I missed
the wedding.

03:12.927 --> 03:15.260
I heard you wept through
the entire thing.

03:15.262 --> 03:17.296
Better now?

03:17.298 --> 03:20.299
Uh, kenna, this is the news
I was trying to tell you about.

03:20.301 --> 03:24.369
Diane, to what do we owe
this unexpected pleasure?

03:24.371 --> 03:26.205
Are you here
for the ice festival?

03:26.207 --> 03:27.372
Bash hasn't told you?

03:27.374 --> 03:29.308
My son has gifted me

03:29.310 --> 03:31.877
Some of the lands granted
to him by francis.

03:31.879 --> 03:34.646
And, as I was staying
nearby with friends,

03:34.648 --> 03:36.281
He invited me here

03:36.283 --> 03:38.951
To go over the details
of my new estate.

03:38.953 --> 03:40.953
Well, that's lovely.

03:40.955 --> 03:42.588
Bash, darling,

03:42.590 --> 03:46.458
Did your mother's estate come
with a title perchance?

03:46.460 --> 03:48.894
Oh, bash doesn't care
about titles.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.963
Or he wouldn't have
turned down the duchy

03:50.965 --> 03:51.964
The king offered.

03:51.966 --> 03:52.998
Instead, he took

03:53.000 --> 03:54.433
The barony closer to francis

03:54.435 --> 03:56.268
So he could
continue to serve

03:56.270 --> 03:57.569
As the king's deputy.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.938
I could have been
a duchess.

03:59.940 --> 04:02.307
Have I caused marital discord?

04:03.576 --> 04:05.377
Nothing could be further
from my mind.

04:13.386 --> 04:15.387
Makeup, jewelry.

04:15.389 --> 04:17.389
They're all just
distractions

04:17.391 --> 04:19.291
To hide the corrupt
flesh underneath.

04:19.293 --> 04:21.293
Your flesh is not nearly
corrupt enough

04:21.295 --> 04:24.296
Since you started this
campaign of self-flagellation.

04:24.298 --> 04:26.698
And not the enjoyable kind.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.268
I've made a mess of this family.

04:29.270 --> 04:31.036
If only I knew how
to make things right.

04:31.038 --> 04:33.438
Run and play while I
talk to your father.

04:34.374 --> 04:36.708
And try not to scare
anyone to death.

04:36.710 --> 04:37.943
Especially claude.

04:39.912 --> 04:41.546
When I chose
to let claude live,

04:41.548 --> 04:42.881
I thought they'd
never forgive me.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.283
But they're not angry anymore.

04:44.285 --> 04:45.450
How did you do it?

04:45.452 --> 04:46.852
I listened, catherine.

04:46.854 --> 04:48.320
I gave them time,

04:48.322 --> 04:50.289
Respect and love.

04:50.291 --> 04:53.292
That's what families ought to
offer each other, isn't it?

04:53.294 --> 04:55.594
In a perfect world, yes.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.729
Not a perfect
world, catherine.

04:57.731 --> 05:01.800
This world, which is
so close to yours,

05:01.802 --> 05:04.336
If only you'd choose to
be more a part of it.

05:04.338 --> 05:06.638
How can I choose
to be a part of your world?

05:06.640 --> 05:08.940
I don't even know
if it's real, if you're real.

05:08.942 --> 05:10.075
Am I going mad?

05:10.077 --> 05:12.411
What does "real"
even mean, hmm?

05:14.380 --> 05:15.814
Hello, brother.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.816
You don't seem in
very high spirits.

05:17.818 --> 05:20.085
Wife troubles?

05:20.087 --> 05:21.687
If so, I'm sorry.

05:21.689 --> 05:23.322
I mean it, bash.

05:23.324 --> 05:24.623
Kenna was rather kind
to me, after all.

05:24.625 --> 05:25.991
What are you after?

05:25.993 --> 05:27.626
Do I have to be
after something

05:27.628 --> 05:29.961
If, for one moment,
I'm not being beastly?

05:29.963 --> 05:31.630
Is that really what
people think of me?

05:31.632 --> 05:32.864
Only the ones
who know you.

05:32.866 --> 05:35.867
I suppose it's
no wonder, then.

05:35.869 --> 05:40.339
The leap between beast and
murderer isn't so great, is it?

05:40.341 --> 05:42.541
My mother thinks I
killed the twins.

05:42.543 --> 05:44.476
To the point that she
was trying to poison me.

05:44.478 --> 05:46.345
Kenna was right.

05:46.347 --> 05:47.713
I was five.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.348
Can you imagine
what that's like?

05:49.350 --> 05:50.549
Being accused
of something

05:50.551 --> 05:52.484
You're too young
to even remember.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.052
This new post
you've taken,

05:54.054 --> 05:56.521
You get to the bottom
of things, don't you?

05:56.523 --> 05:58.357
You help people.

05:58.359 --> 06:00.559
You want me to look into it.

06:00.561 --> 06:02.361
That's what you're
after, isn't it?

06:07.633 --> 06:09.601
Tell me everything
you know.

06:09.603 --> 06:13.438
I suggest retaining
the montagnol chateau

06:13.440 --> 06:15.907
With the northwest parcels.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.976
They contain grain fields,
while the eastern lands

06:17.978 --> 06:19.511
Are suitable
for sheep husbandry.

06:19.513 --> 06:20.946
Good.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.948
List montagnol
and the northwest parcels

06:22.950 --> 06:24.082
As one holding.

06:24.084 --> 06:26.485
Mary:
Lord narcisse.

06:26.487 --> 06:30.389
So good to see you cooperating
in carving up your empire.

06:30.391 --> 06:32.791
What crime did you
confess to in the end?

06:32.793 --> 06:37.696
I'm guilty of embezzling
from the crown, majesty.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.398
Ah, embezzlement.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.500
Excellent choice.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.835
If you had been guilty
of blackmailing us--

06:43.837 --> 06:45.670
Unthinkable, really--

06:45.672 --> 06:48.507
We would have taken your
lands and your head.

06:48.509 --> 06:51.443
I am grateful
for the king's mercy.

06:51.445 --> 06:54.045
I only hope that
I can be useful.

06:54.047 --> 06:57.048
Francis, since it's time for the
king to take trusted counsel,

06:57.050 --> 07:00.519
I think lord narcisse would be
more useful outside the door.

07:00.521 --> 07:03.588
Thank you for your help,
narcisse. You may go.

07:09.629 --> 07:11.696
I assume the best parcels
of land are to go

07:11.698 --> 07:13.131
To narcisse's allies?

07:13.133 --> 07:15.500
He may bow and scrape
to save his neck,

07:15.502 --> 07:17.469
But they won't, not
unless we buy them off.

07:17.471 --> 07:19.471
Of course.

07:19.473 --> 07:22.073
But there still is a great deal
of land to give away.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.443
I want to start
by restoring some lands

07:24.445 --> 07:26.578
To the protestants
that narcisse stole them from.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.713
As long as you take care
to send the right message

07:28.715 --> 07:30.148
So soon after the castle attack.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.584
That's why I plan
to only give lands to lords

07:32.586 --> 07:33.718
Who have proven
their loyalty.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.520
Like lord condÃ©, you mean?

07:35.522 --> 07:37.989
Few protestants have
been as loyal as he.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.825
Especially after
the attack.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.827
CondÃ©.

07:41.829 --> 07:43.161
Yes, why not?

07:44.597 --> 07:45.464
Queen mary,

07:45.466 --> 07:46.631
We have
troubling word

07:46.633 --> 07:47.699
About one of your ladies.

07:51.804 --> 07:54.139
I've received an unsettling
report from the guards.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.475
A prisoner that
they are questioning

07:56.477 --> 07:59.244
Made a rather
outrageous claim.

07:59.246 --> 08:01.713
He says that your husband
is tied to the radicals

08:01.715 --> 08:03.081
Who attacked
the castle.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.484
That castleroy
funded them.

08:05.486 --> 08:07.986
What prisoner?

08:07.988 --> 08:09.588
I'm afraid it
doesn't matter.

08:09.590 --> 08:11.223
If there is any truth
to these claims,

08:11.225 --> 08:12.657
Any truth whatsoever,

08:12.659 --> 08:15.160
Francis and I may not
be able to save you.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.561
I know this is
terrible news,

08:16.563 --> 08:18.497
And I'm sorry to put
you through this.

08:18.499 --> 08:19.498
Put me through this?

08:19.500 --> 08:20.899
What exactly?

08:20.901 --> 08:23.535
Greer, you are one of
my oldest friends,

08:23.537 --> 08:25.570
And I love
and trust you,

08:25.572 --> 08:27.572
But I need to know if
there is any chance

08:27.574 --> 08:29.908
You could be linked to
this, however unjustly.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.910
If castleroy gave
money to protestants,

08:31.912 --> 08:34.579
If the radicals
were in your home,

08:34.581 --> 08:36.948
If there is any traceable
link to your household.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.950
No.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.519
No, of course not.

08:40.521 --> 08:43.054
My husband has always been
loyal, and, for me, I...

08:43.056 --> 08:44.789
I have never doubted
your loyalty.

08:48.628 --> 08:50.662
Leith: You're searching
your chambers to make sure

08:50.664 --> 08:51.897
There's nothing to tie you

08:51.899 --> 08:53.965
To castleroy's
treason, aren't you?

08:53.967 --> 08:55.567
Please don't deny it.

08:55.569 --> 08:56.868
I work with the guards.
I hear everything

08:56.870 --> 08:57.969
That comes out of the dungeons.

08:57.971 --> 08:59.137
It's not his treason, leith.

08:59.139 --> 09:00.272
It's ours.

09:01.607 --> 09:03.542
You knew castleroy
funded the attack?

09:03.544 --> 09:04.976
Neither one of us knew it.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.811
My husband thought
he was funding a school.

09:06.813 --> 09:08.313
We were tricked

09:08.315 --> 09:09.948
By the radicals.
Dear god.

09:09.950 --> 09:12.684
I almost confessed
to mary.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.619
Now I wish I had,
but I was so afraid.

09:15.788 --> 09:17.789
I can tell her the truth.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.324
I can throw myself on her mercy.

09:19.326 --> 09:21.192
No, mary's mercy
can't save you.

09:21.194 --> 09:23.228
Too many people were
killed in the attack.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.664
Too many nobles would
happily dangle your fate

09:25.666 --> 09:27.866
To extract a price
from francis and mary.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.334
And if they
can't pay it...

09:29.336 --> 09:31.970
Well, then what
can I do?
Think.

09:31.972 --> 09:34.005
If there's evidence anywhere,
we need to find it.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.140
I've been searching
through letters

09:35.142 --> 09:38.677
Well, is there anything else
written down? Anywhere?

09:38.679 --> 09:40.679
Think hard.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.814
I have wondered
about the counting house.

09:42.816 --> 09:44.583
He left it to me
as a source of income.

09:44.585 --> 09:47.586
It would hold
his personal ledger.

09:47.588 --> 09:51.222
If it lists any payments to men
now known as radicals...

09:51.224 --> 09:53.325
You'll die
for treason.

09:53.327 --> 09:55.727
Please help me, leith.

10:02.702 --> 10:06.037
Ah, why, diane.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.372
I heard you were back
to visit your son.

10:07.374 --> 10:10.208
How daring of you
to return.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.043
After you banished me?

10:12.045 --> 10:14.913
After you took away everything
that henry promised me?

10:14.915 --> 10:16.715
Come, now.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.717
You gained something
since henry's death.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.919
A daughter-in-law, kenna.

10:20.921 --> 10:24.689
Well, granted, she was henry's
discarded girlfriend.

10:24.691 --> 10:26.758
The one that replaced you.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.227
Ah, with a twitch of her ass.

10:29.229 --> 10:31.963
Enjoy your
expanded family.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.298
And what of your family?

10:33.300 --> 10:34.666
If claude's looks

10:34.668 --> 10:36.234
Could kill,
I do believe

10:36.236 --> 10:38.370
You'd be bathing
in your own blood.

10:43.409 --> 10:45.310
Princess claude.

10:45.312 --> 10:48.279
Ah, have you come
to steal a glance

10:48.281 --> 10:49.914
At your old mistress?

10:49.916 --> 10:52.083
Is it just me,

10:52.085 --> 10:54.753
Or does diane look a little
the worse for wear?

10:54.755 --> 10:56.121
Say it.

10:56.123 --> 10:57.756
I want to hear you say it.

10:57.758 --> 10:59.758
She looks old and too thin.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.127
So many mistakes,
I see them all

11:02.129 --> 11:03.895
So clearly now.

11:03.897 --> 11:07.332
That was a very
expensive mistake.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.735
What jealous tantrum
did that necklace pay for?

11:10.737 --> 11:12.404
(scoffs) look at claude.

11:12.406 --> 11:15.173
She's rubbing my nose in it.

11:15.175 --> 11:18.910
Making sure I see her kindness
to everyone else but me.

11:18.912 --> 11:21.846
I don't know why you subject
yourself to this torment,

11:21.848 --> 11:23.748
When you have another family
that loves you

11:23.750 --> 11:24.816
Without blame

11:24.818 --> 11:27.052
Or judgment.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.223
Because I wonder
about all this.

11:32.225 --> 11:35.326
Your new devotion to me.

11:35.328 --> 11:36.795
And these girls,

11:36.797 --> 11:38.697
Grown into the very image

11:38.699 --> 11:40.365
I had of them in my mind.

11:40.367 --> 11:43.101
Are you all in my mind?

11:43.103 --> 11:44.903
Or are you really here?

11:44.905 --> 11:47.038
Here to soothe my guilt

11:47.040 --> 11:48.807
For all the mistakes
that I made?

11:48.809 --> 11:49.908
What mistakes?

11:49.910 --> 11:52.343
I heard that bash

11:52.345 --> 11:55.113
Is helping claude find out
if she really killed the twins.

11:55.115 --> 11:58.083
Shouldn't I have been asking
those questions?

11:58.085 --> 11:59.784
If you had,

11:59.786 --> 12:00.952
You would've only
spread suspicion

12:00.954 --> 12:02.353
That claude was a monster.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.122
Instead,
you kept the evidence,

12:04.124 --> 12:06.257
Ample evidence,
to yourself.

12:06.259 --> 12:07.926
You even kept it from me.

12:08.961 --> 12:10.261
And I'm glad that you did.

12:10.263 --> 12:11.362
All you've ever done

12:11.364 --> 12:13.164
For your children is love

12:13.166 --> 12:16.735
Love in return is what
you deserve, catherine.

12:16.737 --> 12:17.502
Come.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.170
Let's get away from here, hm?

12:21.340 --> 12:23.408
Yes, let's.

12:25.845 --> 12:28.179
You said you thought
of something. What is it?

12:28.181 --> 12:30.849
Royal children are never alone.

12:30.851 --> 12:33.184
Yet I managed to sneak in
and stuff flowers

12:33.186 --> 12:34.886
Down the twins' throats?

12:34.888 --> 12:35.954
Where were their nannies
that night?

12:35.956 --> 12:37.889
I had the same question.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.791
I sought out all the nannies
that were here at that time.

12:39.793 --> 12:41.860
One of them died of old age.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.294
The others I'm having
a harder time finding.

12:43.296 --> 12:44.763
If you locate them,

12:44.765 --> 12:46.831
I want to question them
with you.

12:46.833 --> 12:48.767
Louis.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.301
If I'd known you were
staying at court

12:50.303 --> 12:52.370
To make winter supply deals,
I would never have sent

12:52.372 --> 12:53.805
My letter through
your envoy.

12:53.807 --> 12:56.474
Well, I just received it.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.409
I assume you're pleased.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.512
I might be if I could accept
these holdings.

13:00.514 --> 13:02.380
What do you mean? Why can't you?

13:02.382 --> 13:03.982
It doesn't feel right.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.550
Other protestant lords
have sacrificed more.

13:05.552 --> 13:06.951
They're more deserving.

13:06.953 --> 13:09.053
But francis, your king,
has made this offer.

13:09.055 --> 13:11.556
He's going to wonder
why you would refuse him.

13:11.558 --> 13:13.892
Let him wonder, then.
Perhaps he should.

13:14.894 --> 13:16.227
Louis, is this about

13:16.229 --> 13:18.263
The attack on the castle? On me?

13:18.265 --> 13:19.564
It's about all the attacks.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.499
Blood for blood for blood,
none of it needed

13:21.501 --> 13:23.835
If francis had simply said no
to a few catholic thugs.

13:23.837 --> 13:25.236
It's not that simple,
believe me.

13:25.238 --> 13:26.571
I know what the politics were.

13:26.573 --> 13:27.806
Please, I can't listen to you

13:27.808 --> 13:28.973
Defend the man any longer.

13:28.975 --> 13:30.141
Just once, I'd like

13:30.143 --> 13:31.342
To hear him defend himself.

13:31.344 --> 13:32.443
Louis.

13:32.445 --> 13:33.845
Please, listen.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.847
If you'll excuse me.

13:45.291 --> 13:47.458
I've never met a lady who
knew how to read accounts.

13:47.460 --> 13:50.295
My husband felt I should
understand his businesses.

13:50.297 --> 13:52.864
I'll review this
in its entirety this evening.

13:52.866 --> 13:54.866
I'd also like
my husband's personal ledger.

13:54.868 --> 13:56.434
He asked me to fetch it
for safekeeping.

13:56.436 --> 13:57.869
(chuckles)

13:57.871 --> 13:59.871
Safekeeping from whom,
the crown?

13:59.873 --> 14:01.606
I don't know what you mean.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.842
Surely you've heard the rumors
if I have.

14:03.844 --> 14:05.009
Word of financial ties

14:05.011 --> 14:06.878
Between your lord husband

14:06.880 --> 14:08.079
And radical protestants.

14:08.081 --> 14:10.882
I can assure you
that no such ties exist.

14:10.884 --> 14:12.350
But if they did,

14:12.352 --> 14:14.252
The evidence would be
in his personal ledger.

14:14.254 --> 14:15.587
That's why I've taken

14:15.589 --> 14:17.522
The precaution of hiding it.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.924
The lady has asked
for her property.

14:19.926 --> 14:22.060
I think it'd be best
you deliver it.

14:22.062 --> 14:24.128
The lady and I are partners.

14:24.130 --> 14:25.530
It benefits neither of us

14:25.532 --> 14:26.865
For the book to be found.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.266
The crown confiscates

14:28.268 --> 14:30.468
Any business belonging
to traitors.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.270
You have me at a disadvantage.

14:32.272 --> 14:34.138
You know where the ledger is;
I do not.

14:34.140 --> 14:37.275
You're too good at business
not to expect some price.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.944
Your husband deeded me
51% of this business

14:39.946 --> 14:42.013
So it would be legally held
by a man.

14:42.015 --> 14:44.515
I should like my ownership
to be complete.

14:50.456 --> 14:51.623
Don't do it, greer.

14:51.625 --> 14:53.892
What choice do I have?

14:56.395 --> 14:59.097
Remember, if that book is found,

14:59.099 --> 15:01.165
I'll make sure the crown knows
you were my partner

15:01.167 --> 15:03.001
In its concealment as well.

15:03.003 --> 15:04.502
They might take your head,

15:04.504 --> 15:07.505
As well as your new
counting house.

15:07.507 --> 15:11.009
Bash: It took me longer
to find the twins' nanny.

15:11.011 --> 15:12.510
She changed her name
after marrying.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.245
She did more than marry.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.915
She married a noble.

15:16.917 --> 15:18.950
Wonder how she managed that.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.154
I hope I haven't kept you.

15:23.156 --> 15:26.057
It's a great honor being invited
to speak with your highness.

15:26.059 --> 15:27.258
If this is about
your charity project,

15:27.260 --> 15:29.427
My husband and I would
be honored to...

15:29.429 --> 15:30.695
Actually, we were hoping
to speak with you

15:30.697 --> 15:32.497
About your time at the castle.

15:32.499 --> 15:33.932
When you were a nanny.

15:33.934 --> 15:35.533
Oh.

15:35.535 --> 15:37.702
Lady yvonne,
I hope our questions

15:37.704 --> 15:39.003
Aren't making you uncomfortable.

15:39.005 --> 15:40.538
You seem...

15:40.540 --> 15:42.240
As if you might crawl
out of your skin.

15:42.242 --> 15:44.609
Do press on, bash.

15:44.611 --> 15:48.179
I'm upset because those
were such sad days.

15:48.181 --> 15:51.049
When the twins died,
we were all very distraught.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.350
You say you were there
when the bodies were found.

15:52.352 --> 15:54.686
Can you tell us exactly
what happened?

15:54.688 --> 15:58.056
I'd only gone out for a moment
or two to use the privy,

15:58.058 --> 15:59.090
And when I came back,

15:59.092 --> 16:00.725
They were dead.

16:00.727 --> 16:03.027
Both of them?

16:03.029 --> 16:04.729
Didn't you think that was odd?

16:04.731 --> 16:06.097
Were you there
when the doctor came?

16:06.099 --> 16:07.465
Did you see him

16:07.467 --> 16:08.633
Pull the flowers
from their throats?

16:08.635 --> 16:10.034
Yes, of course.

16:10.036 --> 16:11.202
Bash, it was her.

16:11.204 --> 16:12.737
I don't know what you mean.

16:12.739 --> 16:14.138
There were only three people

16:14.140 --> 16:15.273
Who knew
about the flowers, yvonne.

16:16.208 --> 16:17.342
The doctor who found them,

16:17.344 --> 16:19.010
Catherine, who alone was told,

16:19.012 --> 16:20.478
And the person
who put them there.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.080
You killed them.

16:22.082 --> 16:23.214
How could you do
such a thing? Why?

16:23.216 --> 16:25.083
I didn't, I swear.

16:25.085 --> 16:26.985
The babies were dead
when I found them.

16:26.987 --> 16:28.219
What are you talking about?

16:28.221 --> 16:30.054
And be very clear,
or you will hang,

16:30.056 --> 16:31.723
And I will cheer for your death.

16:31.725 --> 16:33.624
He was the king.

16:33.626 --> 16:37.428
How was I supposed to say no?

16:38.630 --> 16:40.365
<i>He was relentless.</i>

16:40.367 --> 16:42.400
<i>He'd come into the nursery.</i>

16:42.402 --> 16:45.303
<i>He'd follow me</i>
<i>to my chambers at night.</i>

16:45.305 --> 16:47.372
Then, one night,
he pulled me into a corner.

16:47.374 --> 16:51.042
<i>He wanted me to try some kind</i>
<i>of new turkish smoke.</i>

16:51.044 --> 16:52.643
<i>It was a simpler request</i>

16:52.645 --> 16:55.013
<i>Than his others.</i>

16:55.015 --> 16:57.215
After that,
I lost track of time.

16:57.217 --> 16:59.017
<i>Of myself.</i>

16:59.019 --> 17:00.718
<i>When I woke,</i>
<i>I ran back to the nursery,</i>

17:00.720 --> 17:03.454
<i>But hours and hours</i>
<i>had gone by,</i>

17:03.456 --> 17:05.556
<i>And I found the windows</i>
<i>blown open by the wind.</i>

17:05.558 --> 17:07.558
<i>It was freezing in there.</i>

17:07.560 --> 17:09.260
I must have forgotten
to latch them.

17:09.262 --> 17:11.095
<i>I ran to the babies,</i>

17:11.097 --> 17:12.764
<i>But they'd stopped breathing.</i>

17:12.766 --> 17:15.733
<i>I tried to warm them,</i>
<i>but it was no use.</i>

17:15.735 --> 17:17.769
And then I realized
what would happen to me

17:17.771 --> 17:19.470
If the queen found out.

17:19.472 --> 17:22.140
<i>I saw claude's little dress</i>
<i>in the corner--</i>

17:22.142 --> 17:24.342
<i>The one with the flowers</i>
<i>torn off--</i>

17:24.344 --> 17:26.144
And I knew the answer.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.179
So after my sisters
froze to death,

17:28.181 --> 17:30.615
You shoved flowers
into their mouths

17:30.617 --> 17:32.417
And waited for my mother
to blame me?

17:32.419 --> 17:34.585
I hoped she would think
you were too young

17:34.587 --> 17:36.354
To know what you'd done.

17:36.356 --> 17:38.056
I hoped she'd forgive you.

17:38.058 --> 17:40.158
She did not forgive me.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.292
Why weren't
you punished

17:41.294 --> 17:42.427
For leaving your post?

17:42.429 --> 17:43.828
Don't you see?

17:43.830 --> 17:46.064
Mother and father both
covered up for her

17:46.066 --> 17:47.632
Without realizing the
other was doing it.

17:47.634 --> 17:49.267
Mother didn't want
any questions asked,

17:49.269 --> 17:50.635
Because she told
that fever story

17:50.637 --> 17:52.103
So no one thought
me a monster.

17:52.105 --> 17:54.205
And father married you
off to some noble

17:54.207 --> 17:56.074
To make sure
you never told mother

17:56.076 --> 17:57.508
Where you really were that
night, isn't that right?

17:57.510 --> 17:59.544
Please, forgive me.

17:59.546 --> 18:01.345
I was afraid of your parents.

18:01.347 --> 18:03.214
Both of them.
Well, now you
can be afraid of me!

18:03.216 --> 18:04.415
You killed my sisters

18:04.417 --> 18:06.150
And made me pay for it

18:06.152 --> 18:07.452
My entire life!

18:07.454 --> 18:09.253
Claude, there will be justice,
I promise you.

18:09.255 --> 18:10.421
Guards, please take

18:10.423 --> 18:12.223
This woman away.
No!

18:12.225 --> 18:13.224
Oh, no, please!

18:13.226 --> 18:14.592
Please, your highness.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.194
Forget about her.

18:16.196 --> 18:18.262
What matters is
you're innocent.

18:18.264 --> 18:19.797
You've always been innocent.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.866
(sighs)

18:21.868 --> 18:24.168
God.

18:24.170 --> 18:26.137
Come on, mother!

18:26.139 --> 18:28.106
Coming.

18:28.108 --> 18:29.607
Forget the ice festival;
come with us!

18:29.609 --> 18:31.375
I need rest.

18:31.377 --> 18:32.877
Are you having
as much fun as I am?

18:32.879 --> 18:35.880
I am, as-as much as I can.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.348
As much as you can?

18:39.585 --> 18:42.720
I want to enjoy myself, I do,

18:42.722 --> 18:43.754
But how can I

18:43.756 --> 18:45.790
When you bring me such pleasure,

18:45.792 --> 18:48.226
But also such pain?

18:48.228 --> 18:51.562
I hid the truth
about your murders,

18:51.564 --> 18:56.200
But if claude killed you,
I raised a monster.

18:56.202 --> 18:58.903
And if she didn't, I have been
treating her like one

18:58.905 --> 19:00.271
For no reason.

19:00.273 --> 19:02.340
So long ago, catherine.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.875
Who could blame you?

19:03.877 --> 19:05.710
You lost your babies.

19:05.712 --> 19:07.378
Don't second-guess yourself,

19:07.380 --> 19:09.347
Or you will go mad.

19:09.349 --> 19:11.182
(girls giggling)

19:11.184 --> 19:12.850
What about claude?

19:12.852 --> 19:14.285
Shouldn't I be with her now?

19:14.287 --> 19:15.286
You think she needs you?

19:15.288 --> 19:16.921
That francis needs you?

19:16.923 --> 19:18.823
Not anymore.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.758
The girls need you.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.860
They have no one but us,

19:22.862 --> 19:25.830
And unlike your other children,
they're asking for you.

19:25.832 --> 19:29.200
Catherine, be the mother
they want.

19:29.202 --> 19:31.836
Be the mother they need.

19:31.838 --> 19:35.773
â™ª in hiding
from the front line â™ª

19:35.775 --> 19:38.242
â™ª it's been here

19:38.244 --> 19:39.443
(laughter)

19:39.445 --> 19:43.681
â™ª the whole time

19:43.683 --> 19:48.719
â™ª I sleep to keep my mind
at ease â™ª

19:48.721 --> 19:52.456
â™ª I wander through a dream

19:52.458 --> 19:56.827
â™ª of what I once believed

20:05.437 --> 20:07.705
â™ª my love

20:07.707 --> 20:11.809
â™ª the drums are calling

20:11.811 --> 20:15.713
â™ª a red sky

20:15.715 --> 20:18.816
â™ª a warning.

20:27.259 --> 20:29.327
(grunting)

20:36.435 --> 20:39.503
I understand you've had
some issues with my rule.

20:39.505 --> 20:41.439
You refuse my offers

20:41.441 --> 20:44.742
You-you don't like the way
I handle dissent?

20:44.744 --> 20:47.545
I've questioned a few
of your acts of repression, yes.

20:47.547 --> 20:50.381
Do you know where I hear
about most of your dissent?

20:50.383 --> 20:51.449
Mary tells you.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.317
My ambassadors tell me,

20:53.319 --> 20:54.619
My lords tell me,
everyone at court

20:54.621 --> 20:56.487
Tells me, except for my wife,

20:56.489 --> 20:57.788
Who says barely a word.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.457
You think mary's
still protecting me?

20:59.459 --> 21:01.392
I think it's lucky for you
that she does.

21:01.394 --> 21:04.462
I think it's sad that either of
us should need her protection.

21:05.497 --> 21:06.998
And that one of us
utterly failed

21:07.000 --> 21:08.899
To protect her
just when she needed it most.

21:11.803 --> 21:14.572
I warn you, cousin.

21:14.574 --> 21:16.574
Your words are unwise.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.378
Perhaps we should
leave our words aside.

21:20.380 --> 21:21.812
Air our differences
sportingly.

21:21.814 --> 21:23.481
You've played quarterstaff, yes?

21:28.520 --> 21:30.655
I should go back inside.

21:30.657 --> 21:32.356
It's so cold.

21:32.358 --> 21:33.391
Girls, enough
fun for now.

21:33.393 --> 21:35.493
Run back inside.

21:36.662 --> 21:39.530
Your mother and I
will be along shortly.

21:39.532 --> 21:42.066
Oh, my god, catherine...

21:42.068 --> 21:45.069
To see all this light again.

21:45.071 --> 21:47.571
It was so dark without you.

21:47.573 --> 21:49.540
And you...

21:49.542 --> 21:51.509
So beautiful.

22:03.755 --> 22:05.656
Henry, stop.

22:05.658 --> 22:08.025
I'm shivering.
And I'm offering warmth.

22:08.027 --> 22:09.627
More than warmth.

22:10.829 --> 22:13.464
Heat.
Oh.

22:13.466 --> 22:14.532
Do you feel it?

22:14.534 --> 22:16.834
Hmm?
Yes.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.436
Oh, keep doing that.

22:18.438 --> 22:21.472
(laughs)

22:21.474 --> 22:22.707
Trust me, I know what you need.

22:22.709 --> 22:24.608
What is that?

22:24.610 --> 22:26.544
Me.

22:27.512 --> 22:29.580
Us.

22:29.582 --> 22:31.082
Together forever.

22:32.451 --> 22:34.885
What did you used to say to me?

22:36.521 --> 22:39.557
When we'd make love
and I was so near...

22:43.962 --> 22:46.630
You're almost home.

22:54.506 --> 22:56.040
(exhales)

22:57.743 --> 22:59.877
(grunting)

23:07.652 --> 23:09.687
Is there something between
them we don't know about?

23:14.893 --> 23:17.661
(grunting)

23:17.663 --> 23:18.963
(spectators gasp)

23:24.536 --> 23:26.670
You're what's
between them.

23:29.908 --> 23:31.175
(grunting)

23:41.853 --> 23:43.587
Enough! Stop!

24:00.138 --> 24:02.773
Bash:
Catherine?

24:02.775 --> 24:04.542
Catherine!

24:05.777 --> 24:07.111
Henry.

24:08.113 --> 24:09.780
What on earth are you doing?

24:09.782 --> 24:12.116
You'll freeze to death.

24:12.118 --> 24:14.218
You're lucky I found you.

24:14.220 --> 24:16.220
I was looking for you.

24:16.222 --> 24:17.955
A servant saw you
by the garden door.

24:17.957 --> 24:20.124
I followed your
footprints.

24:20.126 --> 24:21.859
Why are you helping me?

24:21.861 --> 24:24.695
That's a very
good question.

24:24.697 --> 24:27.064
So henry lured the nanny away

24:27.066 --> 24:29.633
And the twins froze to death,
poor things.

24:30.802 --> 24:32.169
And then she framed claude

24:32.171 --> 24:33.838
To try to cover her neglect.

24:33.840 --> 24:36.040
Where is she now?
In the dungeon.

24:36.042 --> 24:38.576
She'll be punished,

24:38.578 --> 24:40.244
But who will punish me?

24:40.246 --> 24:42.012
You thought you were
protecting your daughter.

24:42.014 --> 24:43.981
Yes, I believed that.

24:43.983 --> 24:46.183
I think I was just trying
to protect myself

24:46.185 --> 24:48.185
By not asking questions

24:48.187 --> 24:50.654
I didn't want to know
the answers to.

24:51.656 --> 24:53.991
Was my daughter truly guilty?

24:53.993 --> 24:56.193
What damage did our
terrible marriage

24:56.195 --> 24:58.896
Do to our children?

25:00.732 --> 25:03.801
I knew they were hurt.

25:03.803 --> 25:07.071
I didn't know
it cost them their lives.

25:08.974 --> 25:12.276
Oh, he hurt your mother, too.

25:12.278 --> 25:14.545
I think she knew what
she was getting into.

25:14.547 --> 25:17.548
Oh, you're wrong about that.

25:17.550 --> 25:19.116
Once we had enough heirs,

25:19.118 --> 25:21.652
Henry convinced diane
that he'd be all hers.

25:21.654 --> 25:23.554
How do you know this?

25:23.556 --> 25:24.989
Because he told me

25:24.991 --> 25:27.558
There would be no more
carnal relations between us.

25:27.560 --> 25:30.528
He was going to try to be
faithful to his mistress.

25:30.530 --> 25:31.829
Of course, he never was.

25:31.831 --> 25:33.264
I know that

25:33.266 --> 25:34.932
Because of all the
things he bought her,

25:34.934 --> 25:36.934
Just to quell
her rage.

25:36.936 --> 25:39.303
It was quite a temper
your mother had,

25:39.305 --> 25:40.938
When she found out
he'd betrayed her.

25:40.940 --> 25:43.574
Oh, but
the gifts:

25:43.576 --> 25:44.942
Chateaus, jewels,

25:44.944 --> 25:47.244
That ridiculous chapel
he had built

25:47.246 --> 25:49.313
With all that stained glass.

25:49.315 --> 25:51.248
That was after the
twins were born.

25:51.250 --> 25:54.151
Carnal relations never
ended with us, either.

25:54.153 --> 25:56.954
What? What is it?

25:56.956 --> 25:58.789
It's nothing.

25:58.791 --> 26:00.824
I hope it brings you some peace

26:00.826 --> 26:03.060
To know your daughter
didn't kill the twins.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.895
I should go.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.230
Such haste.

26:06.232 --> 26:07.898
I haven't properly mocked you

26:07.900 --> 26:10.100
For saving the life
of your mother's worst enemy.

26:12.604 --> 26:15.105
(door closes)

26:16.241 --> 26:18.309
I shouldn't have
let him provoke me.

26:18.311 --> 26:21.078
But, mary, he did provoke me.

26:21.080 --> 26:24.782
There is something in condÃ©
that needs to be dealt with.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.083
His anger towards me

26:26.085 --> 26:27.751
Is not just about

26:27.753 --> 26:30.054
My mistakes as a ruler.

26:30.056 --> 26:31.989
He has feelings for you,

26:31.991 --> 26:34.959
And now everyone knows it.

26:38.263 --> 26:42.066
And you think that
I encouraged him?

26:42.068 --> 26:43.801
Francis, have you not
been hearing

26:43.803 --> 26:45.336
A word I've said?

26:45.338 --> 26:47.638
I can barely
stand to touch

26:47.640 --> 26:48.739
My own husband.

26:48.741 --> 26:51.141
Why would I...
Ever encourage another?

26:51.143 --> 26:54.178
I know you don't think
you will heal,

26:54.180 --> 26:56.947
But I know
that you will.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.649
You are a survivor

26:58.651 --> 27:00.317
And the strongest person
I've ever known.

27:00.319 --> 27:02.119
It may be too soon

27:02.121 --> 27:04.888
To talk about this,

27:04.890 --> 27:07.358
And it is excruciating

27:07.360 --> 27:09.760
To have to say this to you,
given what you've been through,

27:09.762 --> 27:11.729
But, mary,

27:11.731 --> 27:14.665
This notion of
"separate lives..."

27:14.667 --> 27:16.333
Living separate lives

27:16.335 --> 27:18.202
Is not a solution;
it is a threat.

27:18.204 --> 27:20.304
And not just to our marriage,
but to our rule.

27:20.306 --> 27:22.239
When you give us

27:22.241 --> 27:23.741
An heir someday,

27:23.743 --> 27:26.276
As I have every faith
that you will,

27:26.278 --> 27:28.879
There cannot be
the slightest doubt

27:28.881 --> 27:31.382
About our child's paternity.

27:31.384 --> 27:34.218
Doubts like these start wars.

27:34.220 --> 27:36.186
They put your
country at risk,

27:36.188 --> 27:37.688
As well as your life.

27:37.690 --> 27:39.423
My life.

27:39.425 --> 27:41.058
And not yours.

27:41.060 --> 27:43.193
I know. It is unfair.

27:43.195 --> 27:44.928
My mother was almost beheaded

27:44.930 --> 27:46.797
For infidelity,
while my father

27:46.799 --> 27:48.399
Had every woman
that he wanted.

27:48.401 --> 27:50.668
But that is the way that it is,

27:50.670 --> 27:51.902
Right or wrong.

27:51.904 --> 27:53.437
I remind you
of this

27:53.439 --> 27:54.772
Because I care for you.

27:54.774 --> 27:58.208
Oh, was that "caring"?

27:58.210 --> 28:00.144
It sounds to me like a man

28:00.146 --> 28:02.146
Trying to tighten
his grip on a woman.

28:02.148 --> 28:04.281
You'll understand

28:04.283 --> 28:07.251
If I don't stay to hear more.

28:16.728 --> 28:19.296
Oh, thank you, elise.

28:19.298 --> 28:20.431
There you are,
my queen.

28:20.433 --> 28:22.132
I'm sorry
for letting

28:22.134 --> 28:23.967
Our fun outside get out of hand.

28:23.969 --> 28:26.203
I'd forgotten what cold
can do to the living.

28:26.205 --> 28:28.005
You've forgotten a lot
of things, haven't you?

28:28.007 --> 28:31.041
Like the nanny
that let the twins die

28:31.043 --> 28:33.944
Because she was too busy
with you in bed.

28:35.146 --> 28:36.447
I beg your pardon.

28:37.882 --> 28:40.184
Maybe you honestly
don't remember.

28:40.186 --> 28:41.752
Maybe that's
not your fault,

28:41.754 --> 28:43.454
As I invited you here,
such as you are.

28:43.456 --> 28:44.888
Such as I am?

28:44.890 --> 28:45.889
What am I?

28:45.891 --> 28:47.991
You're a lie, henry.

28:47.993 --> 28:51.161
Because I brought you here
to ease my conscience.

28:51.163 --> 28:53.497
Oh, but you were a lie
in life, too.

28:53.499 --> 28:57.234
Everything you ever spoke of
or promised were all lies.

28:57.236 --> 28:59.269
Loyalty, duty...

28:59.271 --> 29:00.738
Even France.

29:00.740 --> 29:02.372
Nothing mattered more to you
than yourself.

29:02.374 --> 29:04.775
Why are you
arguing, mother?

29:04.777 --> 29:07.277
Because, my darlings,
I'm afraid

29:07.279 --> 29:10.147
Our time together
must come to an end.

29:10.149 --> 29:12.916
Now, you need
to find peace,

29:12.918 --> 29:14.418
Away from this place.

29:14.420 --> 29:17.087
I will be with you
one day, I promise.

29:17.089 --> 29:20.023
To you, it will seem very soon.

29:22.861 --> 29:24.161
Good-bye,

29:24.163 --> 29:25.462
My loves.

29:25.464 --> 29:28.031
Good-bye, mother.
Good-bye, mother.

29:36.307 --> 29:37.508
Oh...

29:37.510 --> 29:39.042
Oh, they're gone.

29:39.044 --> 29:40.310
Catherine...
It was that simple.

29:40.312 --> 29:41.545
Don't break up our family.

29:41.547 --> 29:44.014
Don't you dare speak of family.

29:44.016 --> 29:46.016
You have no idea
what that word means.

29:46.018 --> 29:47.484
A family is more
than one person.

29:47.486 --> 29:48.952
A family is loving people,

29:48.954 --> 29:51.522
Thinking of others
before themselves.

29:51.524 --> 29:55.192
I have always loved
you and the children.

29:55.194 --> 29:56.560
When it was convenient.

29:56.562 --> 29:57.995
When it didn't keep you

29:57.997 --> 29:59.797
From your indulgences
that you crave.

30:00.865 --> 30:02.499
I took you back into my bed

30:02.501 --> 30:04.802
Again and again,
because I loved you.

30:04.804 --> 30:06.470
I taught you

30:06.472 --> 30:08.472
That it was all right
to treat your family

30:08.474 --> 30:10.407
With scorn and neglect.

30:10.409 --> 30:13.544
And look how our children
suffered because of it.

30:13.546 --> 30:15.979
The twins are gone.

30:15.981 --> 30:17.881
I may have lost claude forever.

30:17.883 --> 30:19.983
I will never forgive myself
for that.

30:19.985 --> 30:21.251
Or you.

30:21.253 --> 30:23.520
I will always bear

30:23.522 --> 30:26.890
My guilt,
but I will not bear you.

30:26.892 --> 30:28.826
I want you out
of my life, henry.

30:28.828 --> 30:29.860
Do you hear me?

30:29.862 --> 30:32.329
I don't want you back!

30:32.331 --> 30:34.031
I don't want
you at all.

30:34.033 --> 30:35.833
You're nothing to me.

30:35.835 --> 30:37.167
You're dead.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.836
You're nothing
but dust and bile.

30:38.838 --> 30:39.870
It isn't that easy, catherine.

30:39.872 --> 30:41.104
Oh, begone,

30:41.106 --> 30:42.940
Ghost of my past,

30:42.942 --> 30:45.576
My mistakes,
my foolishness.

30:45.578 --> 30:47.578
Return to your hell

30:47.580 --> 30:49.580
And leave me to mine!

30:59.591 --> 31:01.592
Bash.

31:01.594 --> 31:02.960
What's wrong?

31:02.962 --> 31:04.962
When I was young,
you always told me

31:04.964 --> 31:07.197
That we were
father's real family.

31:07.199 --> 31:08.899
That catherine and her children

31:08.901 --> 31:10.500
Were just for show,
for politics.

31:10.502 --> 31:11.935
You said I shouldn't

31:11.937 --> 31:13.437
Be jealous of them,
and I wasn't.

31:13.439 --> 31:16.440
I loved my brothers and sisters.

31:16.442 --> 31:18.008
But what about you?

31:18.010 --> 31:19.443
Were you threatened by them

31:19.445 --> 31:21.612
In some way?
What are you on about, darling?

31:21.614 --> 31:24.281
Catherine mentioned the chapel
that father built for you.

31:24.283 --> 31:25.515
Do you remember it?

31:25.517 --> 31:27.918
With all that expensive
stained glass?

31:27.920 --> 31:30.187
Because I remember
a day in that chapel.

31:30.189 --> 31:32.122
Damn you, henry!

31:32.124 --> 31:33.924
Damn you!

31:33.926 --> 31:36.493
(screams)

31:36.495 --> 31:39.596
Father told me that that chapel
<i>wasn't built only for you,</i>

31:39.598 --> 31:41.331
But also for me.

31:41.333 --> 31:44.067
After it was unveiled,
he snuck me inside,

31:44.069 --> 31:47.004
And we etched our initials
in the lead, he and I,

31:47.006 --> 31:50.007
Along with the date.

31:50.009 --> 31:52.609
That's why I saved
this piece here, you see?

31:52.611 --> 31:55.679
'cause it was right after this
that you wrecked the window.

31:55.681 --> 31:57.080
I checked the book
of records, mother,

31:57.082 --> 31:58.949
And two days later,
the twins were dead.

31:58.951 --> 32:01.385
You were cursing at father
when you broke this glass.

32:01.387 --> 32:03.387
Were you still angry

32:03.389 --> 32:06.924
That he'd slept with catherine
to conceive the twins?

32:06.926 --> 32:09.493
Or was it about him
seducing the nanny?

32:09.495 --> 32:13.397
Or was it all part of the same
betrayal, eating you up inside?

32:14.933 --> 32:18.068
Do you think it was easy
being the king's mistress?

32:18.070 --> 32:19.469
Hmm?

32:19.471 --> 32:21.271
A position
easily gained.

32:21.273 --> 32:23.273
But held?

32:23.275 --> 32:25.275
For decades?

32:25.277 --> 32:27.644
Say it was an accident,
mother, please.

32:27.646 --> 32:30.347
Say that you only left
those nursery windows open

32:30.349 --> 32:33.583
To get the nanny dismissed,
to keep your hold on the king.

32:33.585 --> 32:35.585
I would like to say that.

32:35.587 --> 32:37.154
I would.

32:37.156 --> 32:39.990
I wanted catherine
to suffer.

32:39.992 --> 32:41.725
I wanted henry
to suffer.

32:41.727 --> 32:43.961
They did.

32:43.963 --> 32:46.697
The estate I offered
is no longer yours.

32:47.966 --> 32:49.299
I will protect your secret

32:49.301 --> 32:50.634
If you leave today.

32:50.636 --> 32:52.636
But I can't bear to look
at you as you are now,

32:52.638 --> 32:53.971
Much less hanging
from a rope.

32:53.973 --> 32:55.973
Go and never come back.

32:55.975 --> 32:57.341
I am your mother.

32:57.343 --> 32:59.176
Where is your forgiveness?

32:59.178 --> 33:00.677
You absolved your wife,

33:00.679 --> 33:02.179
Even though she was
your father's mistress.

33:02.181 --> 33:05.248
How can you even compare
kenna's affair to this?

33:05.250 --> 33:06.650
She was young
and naive.

33:06.652 --> 33:08.085
She was scared.

33:08.087 --> 33:09.419
You killed
two baby girls.

33:09.421 --> 33:11.121
Kenna, young
and naive?

33:11.123 --> 33:13.123
That doesn't describe
the girl who told catherine

33:13.125 --> 33:15.492
I was in rome
trying to get you legitimized.

33:16.661 --> 33:18.662
What are you talking about?

33:18.664 --> 33:20.130
Kenna would never do that.

33:20.132 --> 33:21.198
But she did.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.066
Ask catherine.

33:23.068 --> 33:26.136
Kenna knew that exposing my plan
could get us both killed,

33:26.138 --> 33:27.571
But she wanted
me gone.

33:27.573 --> 33:30.073
Determined to strike
at her rival for henry.

33:30.075 --> 33:33.143
Just as I was when I left
that nursery window open.

33:33.145 --> 33:36.713
If that's true, then neither
of you deserves my forgiveness.

33:36.715 --> 33:38.782
This is good-bye.

33:40.585 --> 33:41.785
We will never see
one another again.

33:41.787 --> 33:43.754
Bash.

33:51.429 --> 33:53.430
Is francis all right?

33:53.432 --> 33:55.499
Francis is fine.

33:56.601 --> 33:58.602
Lola, I have a favor
to ask of you.

33:58.604 --> 34:00.604
You won't like it,

34:00.606 --> 34:03.673
But if you are loyal to me,
you won't question it.

34:05.810 --> 34:08.712
Mary asked you to offer yourself
as a possible match for me?

34:08.714 --> 34:11.748
Not as directly
as that, but yes.

34:11.750 --> 34:14.084
What does she take us for?
A couple of game pieces

34:14.086 --> 34:15.819
She can shunt aside
to unclutter her board?

34:15.821 --> 34:18.755
Actually, she said she hoped
we'd admire each other

34:18.757 --> 34:20.757
As much as she
admires us.

34:20.759 --> 34:24.394
So we might find the happiness
she's found with francis.

34:28.066 --> 34:29.800
All very neat
and tidy, isn't it?

34:29.802 --> 34:31.268
Well, hardly.

34:32.437 --> 34:34.071
Perhaps you think you're some

34:34.073 --> 34:36.273
Gallant defender of mary's,
but look around.

34:36.275 --> 34:39.342
You've spawned harmful gossip
with your male pride,

34:39.344 --> 34:41.278
And she's doing everything
she can to stop it.

34:41.280 --> 34:44.114
I don't care if your heart
leads you my way or not,

34:44.116 --> 34:45.849
But I won't have it
lead you to mary.

34:45.851 --> 34:47.284
She's my oldest friend,

34:47.286 --> 34:49.352
And I'll see her protected
from any threat,

34:49.354 --> 34:51.254
Gallant or otherwise.

34:51.256 --> 34:53.590
You're quite fierce
when you want to be, aren't you?

34:53.592 --> 34:54.858
Are you mocking me?

34:54.860 --> 34:57.194
I'm admiring you.

34:58.863 --> 35:00.630
All right, then.

35:00.632 --> 35:03.166
Shall we take our royal orders
and see where they lead us?

35:12.610 --> 35:14.144
Your majesty.

35:14.146 --> 35:15.712
You asked for evidence

35:15.714 --> 35:17.380
Proving the castleroy's
innocence.

35:18.716 --> 35:21.451
This is castleroy's
personal ledger,

35:21.453 --> 35:23.854
Found in his counting house.

35:23.856 --> 35:28.258
Its contents will confirm guilt
rather than innocence.

35:42.340 --> 35:44.241
Mary?

35:45.843 --> 35:48.145
I don't know how
much time I have,

35:48.147 --> 35:49.880
But before
this is done,

35:49.882 --> 35:52.883
There are things I
need you to know.

35:52.885 --> 35:54.718
I lied to you, mary,

35:54.720 --> 35:57.254
And that is a
treason in itself.

35:57.256 --> 36:00.157
But aloisius did
nothing wrong...

36:00.159 --> 36:02.192
Greer, stop.

36:02.194 --> 36:04.728
The ledger we found
in your counting house is enough

36:04.730 --> 36:07.564
To prove your guilt in the eyes
of the catholic nobles.

36:09.400 --> 36:11.501
It is not quite enough
in the eyes of the king.

36:11.503 --> 36:13.937
No one can prove

36:13.939 --> 36:16.173
Which protestants you thought
you were giving your money to.

36:16.175 --> 36:17.507
Then I'll live.

36:17.509 --> 36:18.909
Francis and I have
made sure of that, yes.

36:18.911 --> 36:20.744
In the deal we made
with the nobles,

36:20.746 --> 36:23.847
You may keep your life,
but that is all you may keep.

36:23.849 --> 36:27.417
You will lose your title,
your lands, your holdings,

36:27.419 --> 36:28.952
Your rooms
here at the castle

36:28.954 --> 36:31.188
And your position with me.

36:31.190 --> 36:33.823
But where will I live?

36:33.825 --> 36:34.925
H-how will I live?

36:34.927 --> 36:37.761
That can no longer be
my concern.

36:37.763 --> 36:39.429
Or lola's.
Or kenna's.

36:39.431 --> 36:40.864
I'm sorry.

36:40.866 --> 36:42.866
Because I'm a traitor now.

36:42.868 --> 36:44.334
A pariah.

36:44.336 --> 36:46.503
(knocking on door)
one more moment, please.

36:46.505 --> 36:48.205
One more moment--
is that all we have?

36:53.878 --> 36:55.946
The wagon is ready
to take her away.

36:55.948 --> 36:58.281
Nobles are waiting.

36:59.317 --> 37:00.984
Promise me you'll take care.

37:00.986 --> 37:03.820
Promise me, greer,
for it is a dangerous world.

37:03.822 --> 37:04.955
I will.

37:04.957 --> 37:07.457
Thank you.

37:07.459 --> 37:08.858
Good-bye.

37:20.605 --> 37:23.607
I'm so tired of waiting
for liars to tell me the truth.

37:23.609 --> 37:25.242
It's exhausting,
you know that?

37:25.244 --> 37:26.243
Did you hear about greer?

37:26.245 --> 37:27.410
It's so awful.

37:27.412 --> 37:28.878
This time,
I don't want to wait.

37:28.880 --> 37:32.415
You should tell me the truth
without being asked.

37:32.417 --> 37:34.618
Did you tell catherine that
my mother was talking to rome

37:34.620 --> 37:35.685
About getting me legitimized?

37:37.021 --> 37:38.788
I could have been
executed, kenna.

37:38.790 --> 37:39.923
I wasn't thinking
about that.

37:39.925 --> 37:41.324
(groans in frustration)

37:41.326 --> 37:43.293
I just wanted your
mother out of the way.

37:43.295 --> 37:44.794
I was scared.

37:44.796 --> 37:46.029
I couldn't go
back to scotland,

37:46.031 --> 37:47.797
And I couldn't find
a husband here.

37:47.799 --> 37:49.432
I thought I might
lose everything.

37:49.434 --> 37:51.301
And which did you fear
losing the most?

37:51.303 --> 37:53.436
The gifts and privileges
of sharing a bed with the king?

37:53.438 --> 37:54.838
Or his love?

37:54.840 --> 37:56.006
Both.

37:56.008 --> 37:58.275
Is that what you
want to hear?

37:58.277 --> 38:00.343
Is that what I should have said
when we married?

38:00.345 --> 38:02.646
That, yes, I loved him.

38:02.648 --> 38:04.414
Before he went mad.

38:04.416 --> 38:06.283
You never told me that.

38:06.285 --> 38:07.517
Why would I?

38:07.519 --> 38:09.819
You asked me to give us
a chance, so I did.

38:11.656 --> 38:13.923
Bash, you have no idea what it's
like to be a girl in this world.

38:13.925 --> 38:16.026
Owning nothing,
having no power

38:16.028 --> 38:18.395
Except the effect
that you have on men.

38:19.497 --> 38:20.930
The king noticed me,

38:20.932 --> 38:23.033
And for the first
time, I mattered.

38:23.035 --> 38:24.834
What was I
supposed to do?

38:24.836 --> 38:26.503
Throw it away?

38:26.505 --> 38:28.705
Did you throw away mary's
love when you had it?

38:28.707 --> 38:31.441
Besides, why are we even
fighting about this?

38:31.443 --> 38:33.076
Everybody makes mistakes.

38:33.078 --> 38:34.778
It's in the past.

38:34.780 --> 38:36.713
Some things can't stay
in the past.

38:36.715 --> 38:38.715
Some things are
too unforgivable.

38:38.717 --> 38:41.718
When a person is willing
to sacrifice lives

38:41.720 --> 38:43.720
For their own petty interests--

38:43.722 --> 38:46.022
That is one of those things.

38:54.398 --> 38:55.865
Francis:
Mary?

38:55.867 --> 38:58.601
I hate to disturb you, but...

38:58.603 --> 38:59.869
Are you all right?

38:59.871 --> 39:01.938
After everything
that happened with greer.

39:01.940 --> 39:03.373
The truth?

39:04.508 --> 39:07.644
No, I'm not all right.

39:07.646 --> 39:11.047
I've been thinking about all
that we've been through,

39:11.049 --> 39:13.116
My ladies and I.

39:13.118 --> 39:14.617
And sometimes I wonder

39:14.619 --> 39:16.019
If I should have even
brought them with me.

39:16.021 --> 39:19.456
I would have felt
very alone if I hadn't.

39:19.458 --> 39:21.124
As I do now.

39:23.627 --> 39:26.463
Your words were hard to hear,
but they were true.

39:26.465 --> 39:29.499
Appearances matter
for people like us.

39:29.501 --> 39:32.902
CondÃ© and I can appear
to have no friendship

39:32.904 --> 39:34.704
That is more than political.

39:34.706 --> 39:37.040
I can't stand to see you hurt.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.577
I don't want you
to feel so alone.

39:40.579 --> 39:42.579
But I am alone.

39:42.581 --> 39:43.813
We both are.

39:43.815 --> 39:44.981
We don't have to be.

39:46.584 --> 39:49.119
I'd like to stay
with you tonight.

39:50.421 --> 39:53.056
Not for appearances
or politics

39:53.058 --> 39:56.493
Or because you are my wife.

39:56.495 --> 40:00.029
Just to watch over you
while you sleep.

40:00.031 --> 40:01.664
I could stay here.

40:01.666 --> 40:04.100
Happily.

40:09.607 --> 40:11.674
I would like that.

40:20.518 --> 40:21.785
My god...

40:21.787 --> 40:23.787
Catherine.

40:23.789 --> 40:27.624
I admit I was slow
to put it together,

40:27.626 --> 40:30.960
Much to my poor daughter
claude's misfortune.

40:30.962 --> 40:34.197
Then I heard-- bash has
taken away your estate,

40:34.199 --> 40:35.899
Told you to leave.

40:35.901 --> 40:37.434
I started thinking.

40:37.436 --> 40:39.436
The nanny may believe
that the wind

40:39.438 --> 40:42.439
Blew open the
nursery windows.

40:42.441 --> 40:44.207
That isn't possible.

40:44.209 --> 40:45.809
They have
latches on them.

40:45.811 --> 40:48.812
Human hands had to open them.

40:48.814 --> 40:50.814
Jealous hands.

40:50.816 --> 40:53.983
It never occurred to me
that a mother would do this

40:53.985 --> 40:56.186
To another mother's child.

40:57.721 --> 40:59.989
Don't you want to beg
for your life?

40:59.991 --> 41:02.225
You're a hypocrite.

41:02.227 --> 41:04.727
How many mother's children
have you killed?

41:04.729 --> 41:08.164
Oh, indignation
instead of groveling?

41:08.166 --> 41:10.633
I suppose that'll do.

41:17.908 --> 41:21.211
This is for killing my babies.

41:22.179 --> 41:25.181
This is for taking my husband.

41:25.183 --> 41:28.151
Tearing my
family apart.

41:28.153 --> 41:30.553
And this...

41:30.555 --> 41:33.156
Is for turning my daughter
against me.

41:33.158 --> 41:35.592
(gasping):
I did it for henry.

41:35.594 --> 41:37.026
All of it.

41:37.028 --> 41:38.228
How perfect!

41:38.230 --> 41:41.264
He did it all
for henry, too!

41:41.266 --> 41:42.499
You loved him so much?

41:43.200 --> 41:45.535
He's...

41:45.537 --> 41:47.871
All...

41:47.873 --> 41:49.239
Yours.
