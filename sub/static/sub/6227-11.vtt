WEBVTT

00:00.959 --> 00:02.176
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.252 --> 00:03.719
This definitely
belonged to a Grimm.

00:03.795 --> 00:05.923
These books belonged
to Joseph Nebojsa.

00:06.048 --> 00:07.516
You have more?
There are 20.

00:07.591 --> 00:09.264
I've heard of the guy that
your uncle got the books from.

00:09.384 --> 00:11.933
How? There's a Black Claw
on the wall of his house.

00:13.180 --> 00:14.181
Oh.

00:14.306 --> 00:15.906
Looks like we got
our trailer back.

00:15.974 --> 00:17.567
Oh, my God,
another key?

00:18.644 --> 00:21.272
Three of them. Go get the
other two keys from upstairs.

00:21.563 --> 00:23.110
We're going to
the Black Forest.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.707
If it's in Wolfach,
where is it?

00:35.786 --> 00:39.006
Well, these maps
aren't exactly to scale.

00:39.081 --> 00:44.929
So whatever it is could be
anywhere, I mean, in town or...

00:45.003 --> 00:47.927
Well, Wolfach was probably a lot
smaller then than it is now.

00:48.006 --> 00:51.510
Okay, according to this,
it's been around since 1084

00:51.969 --> 00:54.267
and probably goes as far
back as the Romans.

00:54.346 --> 00:56.466
Well, at least we know some
kind of village was there.

00:56.473 --> 00:57.725
But whatever is there now

00:57.808 --> 00:59.810
was probably built
on top of whatever was there.

00:59.893 --> 01:03.739
So wherever it was hidden, it's
gonna be that much harder to find.

01:03.814 --> 01:05.236
When they made the map,
they must have done something

01:05.315 --> 01:06.692
to pinpoint where they put it.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.823
Otherwise no one would
ever be able to find it.

01:08.902 --> 01:12.327
The only reason to make a map is
so you can find something again.

01:12.489 --> 01:15.538
They must have left a clue
somewhere on this map.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.169
Unless it's one of
the keys we don't have.

01:20.330 --> 01:23.834
I have a feeling this is gonna take
a while. I'll make some coffee.

01:25.002 --> 01:27.004
There's got to be
something.

01:28.297 --> 01:30.265
What isn't obvious?

01:48.400 --> 01:50.402
It's from a DEA sting
five years ago.

01:51.028 --> 01:54.532
Former Assemblyman and mayoral
candidate, Steven Gallagher,

01:55.073 --> 01:57.041
buying an eight ball
in a hotel suite.

02:00.162 --> 02:01.709
This can't be
tied back to you?

02:02.205 --> 02:03.206
It won't be.

02:03.707 --> 02:04.708
How come
I've never heard about it?

02:04.791 --> 02:07.044
Because they were looking for
the dealer, not Gallagher.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.845
And Gallagher
made it disappear?

02:08.919 --> 02:10.513
Friends in low places.

02:11.798 --> 02:12.890
How did you get it?

02:13.925 --> 02:15.017
Don't worry about it.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.222
We're doing this
for the right reasons.

02:18.889 --> 02:20.232
The people have
a right to know.

02:20.390 --> 02:22.518
If you're not smart enough
to bury your dirt,

02:22.601 --> 02:23.944
you don't belong in the game.

02:31.276 --> 02:35.747
I was thinking about going home,
but I'm not really tired.

02:36.490 --> 02:39.994
Whatever is not obvious,
is really not obvious

02:40.077 --> 02:43.172
because I am not seeing
anything remotely unapparent.

02:43.372 --> 02:45.215
Wish I knew what
I was looking for.

02:45.415 --> 02:47.338
Is it a letter,
a number, a word?

02:47.542 --> 02:50.591
I mean, why couldn't they have
just done an X marks the spot?

02:50.671 --> 02:54.050
That's what I would've done. Would've
done a big X marks the spot.

02:54.424 --> 02:55.425
Mmm-hmm.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.395
Maybe we do need
the other keys.

02:58.470 --> 02:59.813
Maybe they didn't
leave a mark.

03:00.097 --> 03:01.577
Then what's
the point of making a map?

03:01.723 --> 03:03.521
To drive whoever
has the map crazy.

03:03.600 --> 03:06.854
No, they did this so they could go
back and find whatever they took

03:06.937 --> 03:08.359
from the sack of
Constantinople.

03:08.438 --> 03:09.530
I mean,
you donâ€™t just make a map

03:09.606 --> 03:11.984
and imprint it on the side
of seven keys for fun.

03:12.401 --> 03:15.371
It's the Middle Ages, this type
of metallurgy took a lot of work.

03:16.571 --> 03:19.666
You see, legend has it
that there are seven keys.

03:19.783 --> 03:20.784
Seven?

03:20.867 --> 03:21.868
Forged by the knights

03:21.952 --> 03:24.751
who fought for the Seven Royal
Families in the Fourth Crusade.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.503
Now, when you put
the maps together,

03:28.625 --> 03:31.629
they make one big map,
leading to the location

03:31.795 --> 03:33.797
where the knights
hid the precious wealth

03:33.880 --> 03:37.180
they took from Constantinople
after they sacked and burned it.

03:37.718 --> 03:41.188
Those knights
are our ancestors.

03:45.892 --> 03:49.988
Seven knights
who were Grimms make a map

03:50.355 --> 03:52.983
because they thought whatever
they stole from Constantinople

03:53.066 --> 03:56.240
was worth hiding
so it could be found again.

03:57.612 --> 04:01.833
Um, there's three rivers that
all converge near Wolfach.

04:03.326 --> 04:04.498
Maybe that's the X.

04:04.578 --> 04:07.172
But rivers can change
their course over time.

04:07.622 --> 04:09.249
That would be a moving X.

04:10.167 --> 04:11.544
All right,

04:11.626 --> 04:13.970
there were seven Grimms,
all knights,

04:14.045 --> 04:15.922
fighting in the Fourth Crusade.

04:16.423 --> 04:17.675
Fighting for what?

04:17.757 --> 04:19.510
The power and
the glory of God.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.553
So maybe they buried it
in a church.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.641
I'm just saying, if you're
fighting for God...

04:26.099 --> 04:27.351
Check the churches.

04:27.476 --> 04:30.355
Well, I have been for
the last three hours.

04:30.687 --> 04:34.408
Some of these symbols aren't
churches, I think they're castles.

04:34.649 --> 04:36.071
All churches have steeples.

04:36.193 --> 04:38.287
How many churches
do we have near Wolfach?

04:38.361 --> 04:40.534
All right, on the Key Map

04:40.781 --> 04:45.082
we have one,
two, three, four, five.

04:45.535 --> 04:47.287
This part of the map
is missing.

04:48.622 --> 04:52.126
So here, on this map,
two more churches.

04:52.209 --> 04:53.631
Which makes seven churches.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.929
But they wouldn't have split
it up over seven churches.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.051
Wait a minute.

05:00.050 --> 05:03.475
All the churches have steeples,
except for this one.

05:04.471 --> 05:05.723
This one has a cross.

05:06.181 --> 05:07.182
Mmm.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.277
I don't think that's a cross,
it's too short.

05:12.771 --> 05:14.239
Looks kind of like an X.

05:14.856 --> 05:16.654
And it's right in Wolfach.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.070
That's why we couldn't see it.

05:19.236 --> 05:20.954
They hid it in plain sight.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.657
Maybe X does mark the spot.

05:43.593 --> 05:46.642
Holy ground! A sacred space!

05:46.930 --> 05:49.604
It makes perfect sense they
would bury it in a church!

05:49.766 --> 05:51.188
The church was a safe
place for the knights!

05:51.268 --> 05:52.440
And they had every
reason to believe

05:52.519 --> 05:54.362
it would be around
for hundreds of years.

05:54.437 --> 05:57.281
So, we found it. I mean, maybe.
Maybe we found it.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.030
Maybe we found
approximately where it is,

05:59.109 --> 06:00.782
we still don't
know what it is.

06:00.861 --> 06:03.865
We gotta find out. We've come
this far, we can't stop now.

06:03.947 --> 06:06.621
Five out of the seven keys?
I'm going with you.

06:07.576 --> 06:09.874
Ich spreche Deutsch, man, you don't.
You're gonna need me.

06:09.953 --> 06:12.297
He's right, Nick.
Can't do this alone.

06:13.790 --> 06:14.882
I'll be fine.

06:15.417 --> 06:18.045
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What if
Black Claw knows about the keys

06:18.128 --> 06:19.254
and knew they were
in the trunk?

06:19.337 --> 06:20.839
Black Claw doesn't
know we have the trunk,

06:20.922 --> 06:22.720
and the guys they sent
to find it are dead.

06:22.799 --> 06:26.053
But the trunk did belong to Joseph
Nebojsa, whose distant relative

06:26.136 --> 06:28.264
was a knighted Crusader.
And a Grimm.

06:28.346 --> 06:30.098
And since it was
seven Grimm knights

06:30.181 --> 06:31.854
who buried whatever
it is they buried...

06:31.933 --> 06:32.934
Black Claw
could know about it.

06:33.018 --> 06:34.698
Exactly. So we should
go sooner than later.

06:34.769 --> 06:37.238
Hey, you guys can't travel
under your real names.

06:37.314 --> 06:39.316
Black Claw knows
about you and Monroe.

06:39.649 --> 06:41.367
To be safe,
you can't go as you.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.030
I know somebody who could
get you fake passports.

06:45.196 --> 06:46.573
Better than
coming from us.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.495
So when do we go?

06:48.575 --> 06:50.452
Tomorrow,
first flight we can get.

06:51.036 --> 06:52.413
What are you
gonna tell Adalind?

06:54.039 --> 06:55.291
The truth.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.504
Looks like we're going
on a crusade.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.220
These keys lead to
nothing but death,

07:04.299 --> 07:05.596
you and I both know that.

07:05.717 --> 07:07.037
There are a lot
of powerful people

07:07.052 --> 07:08.645
who will do anything
to get their hands on these.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.597
Adalind, I'm...
It's not worth it!

07:11.014 --> 07:13.437
This is a fantasy
someone had 800 years ago.

07:13.683 --> 07:16.061
This might be a waste
of my time, but I have to go.

07:16.144 --> 07:18.397
My aunt gave me one of these
keys, she believed in it.

07:18.521 --> 07:20.148
It almost cost her
her life.

07:20.357 --> 07:21.529
And I owe it to her.

07:26.404 --> 07:27.451
You.

07:32.035 --> 07:33.878
I probably
owe it to her, too.

07:37.666 --> 07:39.043
Monroe's going with me.

07:39.334 --> 07:41.494
Rosalee will be here with you
and Kelly while I'm gone.

07:41.544 --> 07:42.966
When are you leaving?

07:43.880 --> 07:44.927
Tomorrow.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.395
Look, I know you're worried.

07:59.396 --> 08:00.864
Yeah, lam.

08:01.064 --> 08:03.192
But you're probably right,
it's probably nothing.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.201
What if I'm wrong?

08:05.276 --> 08:06.956
What if what they buried is
something evil,

08:07.028 --> 08:08.200
something they never
wanted found,

08:08.279 --> 08:09.280
and for good reason?

08:09.364 --> 08:10.536
Well, then they wouldn't
have made a map,

08:10.615 --> 08:12.083
they would have
just destroyed it.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.705
Or what if it
couldn't be destroyed?

08:14.202 --> 08:16.580
Then they would've
just buried it.

08:19.165 --> 08:20.667
I know I can't
keep you from going,

08:20.750 --> 08:22.343
it's something you have to do.

08:23.128 --> 08:26.428
But I also know there's a chance
that you won't come back.

08:28.550 --> 08:29.550
Adalind...

08:29.592 --> 08:34.563
And I can't let you go without you
knowing how I feel about you.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.533
And I don't care
if this is a mistake.

08:53.283 --> 08:54.500
I love you.

09:17.015 --> 09:18.688
Hanano's been here
a few days.

09:18.767 --> 09:21.441
If he's moving, a camera
should've picked him up by now.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.396
What's going on?

09:23.480 --> 09:24.840
We haven't been
able to locate him.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.824
No other sightings
of Marwan Hanano

09:26.900 --> 09:28.368
since he arrived in Portland.

09:28.693 --> 09:30.373
Guy looks different
in every photo.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.825
He's gonna be tough to find.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.407
We need to know
why he's here.

09:33.698 --> 09:37.748
Every place he goes, London,
Kiev, Osaka, people die.

09:38.453 --> 09:39.830
If Black Claw brought him
to Portland,

09:39.913 --> 09:41.460
it's not for a vacation.

09:42.207 --> 09:43.504
They could know about you.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.377
You could be the target.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.677
It's possible.

09:49.005 --> 09:50.928
Then the sooner
I find him, the better.

09:51.674 --> 09:52.994
I got it.
Mine, mine, mine.

09:54.219 --> 09:55.516
- Right here!
- Got it!

09:56.304 --> 09:57.430
Go, go!

09:57.555 --> 09:58.852
Oh, come on, man!

09:59.808 --> 10:01.025
Yo, little help?

10:06.064 --> 10:07.281
Where is he?

10:07.357 --> 10:08.609
He'll be here.

10:08.691 --> 10:09.863
I don't like waiting.

10:10.193 --> 10:12.195
Leave it.
He doesn't need a gun.

10:12.487 --> 10:13.784
The target has to be shot.

10:13.863 --> 10:14.910
Why?

10:16.032 --> 10:17.875
It can't look Wesen.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.711
Not my problem.
I'm out of here.

10:19.953 --> 10:23.378
You shouldn't get so excited. People
who get excited make mistakes.

10:23.498 --> 10:24.795
Then people die.

10:24.874 --> 10:25.966
Lucien.

10:26.042 --> 10:27.089
Marwan.

10:27.544 --> 10:28.796
Open it.

10:30.421 --> 10:31.798
.22 caliber?

10:31.881 --> 10:33.178
It's what you asked for.

10:33.424 --> 10:35.643
Extra narrow,
20 inch synthetic barrel,

10:35.718 --> 10:38.471
bolt action, threaded muzzle,
aluminum sound suppressor.

10:38.555 --> 10:39.727
Six times scope.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.900
I'll put it together for you.
No, you won't.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.810
If you made a mistake,
I'll find it.

10:57.323 --> 10:59.826
I don't need a scope.
Heeled bullets?

11:00.243 --> 11:01.961
I made them, one box.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.455
I only need one.

11:16.551 --> 11:17.598
What are you doing?

11:19.596 --> 11:20.893
Seeing if you're any good.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.026
Are you crazy?
You kill someone,

11:25.101 --> 11:26.661
and the cops are
gonna be all over this.

11:26.895 --> 11:29.023
Don't. Not here.

11:32.734 --> 11:33.735
What the hell?

11:39.240 --> 11:40.287
It'll do..

11:53.379 --> 11:55.427
I hope you
brought the key, Nick.

11:55.506 --> 11:57.679
Hank doesn't have
much more time.

11:57.926 --> 12:00.304
I would've thought he meant
more to you than that.

12:00.470 --> 12:01.972
See you at the funeral, Nick.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.141
I'll be sure to cry.

12:05.475 --> 12:06.522
Adalind,

12:07.518 --> 12:09.737
I think it's time
we settle our differences.

12:10.647 --> 12:11.648
Violently.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.500
You okay?

12:27.330 --> 12:28.502
Yeah.

12:29.374 --> 12:31.797
Really?
Are you?

12:33.628 --> 12:35.346
If anyone had said
what we did last night

12:35.421 --> 12:38.174
was even a possibility,
given how we met...

12:38.716 --> 12:40.593
No, I wouldn't have
believed them either.

12:40.843 --> 12:44.188
Everything in our lives
is so complicated,

12:44.264 --> 12:47.268
but last night,
that all kind of went away,

12:47.850 --> 12:49.693
if for a little while.

12:57.694 --> 12:59.196
Trubel?

12:59.529 --> 13:02.703
Nick, I gotta show you something.
Where are you?

13:03.574 --> 13:05.201
His name's Marwan Hanano.

13:05.702 --> 13:07.079
He works for Black Claw.

13:07.704 --> 13:09.297
We don't know much about him
but we've connected him

13:09.372 --> 13:11.500
to a bombing in London,
a riot in Kiev,

13:11.624 --> 13:13.877
and a building fire in Osaka,
all in the last year.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.467
He arrived a few days ago
at PDX on a flight

13:16.546 --> 13:17.946
that originated
from Quito, Ecuador.

13:18.423 --> 13:19.720
Why is he here?

13:20.341 --> 13:21.558
We don't know.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.012
We haven't been
able to find him.

13:24.762 --> 13:26.139
This guy stays
under the radar.

13:26.222 --> 13:28.395
Meisner thinks he might
be here on assignment,

13:28.474 --> 13:29.817
I just wanted
to let you know.

13:30.560 --> 13:33.939
And that's all we have on him,
which, honestly, isn't much.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.152
Hey, Rosalee.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.487
Hey, Nick.
Wu got you and Monroe

13:41.571 --> 13:43.494
on the 8:55 p.m. flight
to Stuttgart

13:43.573 --> 13:45.246
with one stop in Frankfurt.

13:45.325 --> 13:48.249
And Stuttgart's only, like,
a two-hour ride to Wolfach.

13:48.369 --> 13:49.791
But you have the passports?
She got them.

13:49.871 --> 13:50.918
I can be there at 5:00.

13:52.623 --> 13:54.091
We're on a flight
out tonight.

13:54.584 --> 13:55.676
Okay.

13:56.753 --> 13:57.800
Wish I was going with you.

13:57.879 --> 13:59.319
Well, someone's got to
find this guy.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.682
Gonna make sure
this goes out.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.763
Is Marwan Hanano
his real name or an alias?

14:02.842 --> 14:03.889
We don't know.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.769
How'd you get this information?
Meisner.

14:06.137 --> 14:07.559
He wanted us
to be aware of it.

14:07.638 --> 14:10.278
We got a Wesen terrorist working
for Black Claw, loose in Portland.

14:10.350 --> 14:13.854
We don't know where he is, what he
wants, or who his contacts are.

14:13.936 --> 14:16.780
I'm assuming Meisner wants us to
find him so HW can deal with him.

14:16.898 --> 14:17.945
Basically, yeah.

14:19.150 --> 14:21.619
All right, put out an APB, but
strictly a find and follow.

14:21.736 --> 14:23.738
Do not engage,
report contact only.

14:23.821 --> 14:24.947
You know
how to contact Meisner?

14:25.031 --> 14:26.032
We do.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.116
Let's find this guy.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.452
Yes, sir.

14:29.285 --> 14:31.629
Look, I'm gonna be off the
grid for a couple of days.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.173
Anything I need to know?

14:35.208 --> 14:36.630
I don't know yet.

14:38.669 --> 14:39.761
Okay.

14:45.968 --> 14:49.268
So, what is the charge on
this Marwan guy for the APB?

14:49.347 --> 14:50.690
Murder suspect.

14:50.765 --> 14:53.143
Keep it local. We don't want
the Feds in on this one.

14:53.768 --> 14:55.111
Look,
I'm out of here tonight

14:55.186 --> 14:56.779
so I'm gonna have to dump
this one on you guys.

14:56.854 --> 14:57.980
We got you.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.236
Hey, Nick.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.655
You be careful over there.

15:02.026 --> 15:03.198
What he said.

15:03.319 --> 15:04.912
Will do.

15:22.547 --> 15:24.891
You gotta take care of Mommy
while I'm gone.

15:25.383 --> 15:26.555
Here.

15:35.184 --> 15:36.356
You better come back.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.562
I will.

15:37.854 --> 15:41.279
'Cause I don't want to have to
explain to him why you didn't.

16:14.599 --> 16:16.522
Hey, Nick, come on in.
He's almost ready.

16:17.894 --> 16:19.862
I did a little more research
on those churches

16:19.937 --> 16:21.655
near Wolfach in
the Black Forest.

16:21.731 --> 16:24.575
There are 10 altogether, but only
three of those are Catholic.

16:24.734 --> 16:27.578
And it has to be Catholic,
because Martin Luther

16:27.653 --> 16:29.655
didn't nail his 95 Theses
onto the door

16:29.739 --> 16:34.165
of the All Saints Church in
Wittenberg until October 31,1517.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.247
So all the other churches
are way too young.

16:37.413 --> 16:39.093
Well, then those are
what we'll start with.

16:39.165 --> 16:40.758
Oh, and I have
your passports.

16:41.751 --> 16:45.597
I'm traveling under my uncle's
name, Felix Dietrich.

16:45.755 --> 16:48.275
And you're traveling under my
brother's name, Frederick Calvert.

16:48.424 --> 16:51.678
This is really good even for
something completely illegal.

16:51.761 --> 16:52.808
Thanks.

16:53.179 --> 16:55.523
Well,
guess we should hit it.

17:01.103 --> 17:03.731
I'll just put that stuff
in the car for you.

17:07.068 --> 17:09.036
You better be damn careful.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.532
I will.

17:14.534 --> 17:15.786
I love you.

18:18.514 --> 18:20.892
Hey, check it out.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.195
I think that's him.
Over at the food cart.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.443
I can't tell from here.
Are you sure?

18:26.522 --> 18:27.614
Close enough. Let's go.

18:27.690 --> 18:30.034
It's a find and follow,
it says not to engage.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.531
Call it in,
I'll stay with him.

18:33.738 --> 18:36.708
Possible suspect sighting.
Northwest off of Johnson...

18:38.492 --> 18:40.165
Two bicycle cops
just spotted Marwan.

18:40.369 --> 18:42.292
Where?
Lovejoy Fountain Park.

19:50.272 --> 19:53.776
Man, I haven't been to the Black
Forest since I was, like, 25.

19:54.568 --> 19:56.991
We used to come here every couple
of years when I was a kid.

19:57.113 --> 19:59.787
My family hunted here for,
like, hundreds of years.

20:00.950 --> 20:02.952
And when you say hunted,
you mean...

20:05.371 --> 20:08.625
Oh. You know, lots of stuff.

20:10.751 --> 20:12.003
Yeah.

20:19.135 --> 20:20.307
I've got something.

20:20.636 --> 20:21.808
APB just came in.

20:21.887 --> 20:24.106
Hanano was spotted near
Lovejoy Fountain Park.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.395
Did they take any action?

20:25.474 --> 20:26.754
No, but it looks like
Marwan did.

20:26.767 --> 20:28.735
There's a report of a cop being
attacked four blocks away.

20:28.811 --> 20:30.734
His partner is the one
who responded to the APB.

20:30.813 --> 20:32.156
Did he kill the cop?

20:32.231 --> 20:33.733
No. Reported as an assault.

20:33.816 --> 20:35.616
Bring up all the surveillance
in the vicinity.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.153
Let's figure out
where this guy went.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.580
Where's your officer?
Right over there.

20:40.823 --> 20:41.870
What happened?

20:41.949 --> 20:44.077
My partner, Officer Fogel,
spotted the suspect,

20:44.160 --> 20:45.320
followed while
I called it in.

20:45.327 --> 20:47.329
When I couldn't get Fogel on
the radio, I started looking

20:47.413 --> 20:49.336
and by the time I got here,
Fogel was covered in blood.

20:49.415 --> 20:50.535
Did he describe
his attacker?

20:50.624 --> 20:52.592
He was yelling about some
monster thing attacking him.

20:52.668 --> 20:54.011
I mean,
he was obviously in shock.

20:54.128 --> 20:56.096
Did you see the suspect you
were following leave the area?

20:56.172 --> 20:57.765
No, he was already gone
when I got here.

20:57.882 --> 20:59.259
Is this the man you saw?

20:59.341 --> 21:00.513
That's the guy
we were following,

21:00.593 --> 21:02.433
I don't know if that's
who attacked my partner.

21:02.678 --> 21:04.158
I'd really like to
get to the hospital

21:04.180 --> 21:05.352
to check on him,
if that's all right.

21:05.431 --> 21:06.557
Yeah, go ahead.

21:07.475 --> 21:09.068
Marwan must've known
he was made.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.362
Why didn't
Marwan kill Fogel?

21:11.687 --> 21:13.530
That'll put
the whole city on him.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.366
Let's start
checking surveillance.

21:18.194 --> 21:20.367
We really need you to come
out for this, Lindsay.

21:20.571 --> 21:22.699
Your support is
very important to us.

21:23.532 --> 21:25.159
That would be fantastic.

21:25.659 --> 21:26.876
See you then.

21:27.536 --> 21:30.130
Oh, I'm glad you're here. I just got
the head of the teachers' union

21:30.206 --> 21:31.298
to agree to show up
this afternoon.

21:31.373 --> 21:32.716
Well, that's a coup.

21:33.042 --> 21:34.419
Have you seen the news?
No.

21:34.502 --> 21:36.220
Our opponent's
little indiscretion

21:36.295 --> 21:37.342
has been playing
on every channel

21:37.421 --> 21:38.718
since the story broke.

21:39.006 --> 21:40.303
And we're up four points
because of you.

21:40.382 --> 21:41.474
Not because of me.

21:41.550 --> 21:43.928
He dug his own grave,
I just provided the shovel.

21:44.386 --> 21:45.512
And the dirt.

21:45.596 --> 21:46.722
A little of that, too.

21:46.889 --> 21:49.517
After you introduce Dixon
today, don't leave the stage.

21:50.434 --> 21:52.562
I don't want it to look like I'm
trying to hog the limelight.

21:52.728 --> 21:53.775
You aren't.

21:53.896 --> 21:56.490
Standing side by side with
Dixon gives people confidence,

21:56.565 --> 21:58.158
and that gives us votes.

21:58.234 --> 21:59.656
By the way,
here's a few points

21:59.735 --> 22:01.328
we'd like to include
in your intro.

22:01.445 --> 22:02.742
Well, I guess I better
read this.

22:02.988 --> 22:04.080
Yeah, you better.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.334
Hey, Rachel? Can you come
take a look at this?

22:06.408 --> 22:08.331
I think they're putting the
banners in the wrong place.

22:08.536 --> 22:09.537
Oh.

22:13.999 --> 22:15.876
No, no, no, not there.
The other side.

22:16.001 --> 22:17.002
Renard.

22:17.503 --> 22:20.256
We got a hit on Marwan.
We checked it out.

22:20.381 --> 22:23.142
He assaulted a rookie officer out of
the North Precinct that made him.

22:23.217 --> 22:24.969
How's the officer?
In the hospital.

22:25.094 --> 22:26.266
They got him sedated.

22:26.345 --> 22:29.474
He'll live, but he was freaking
out about "seeing a monster."

22:30.266 --> 22:31.859
So he Woged and let him live?

22:32.560 --> 22:33.857
Any idea why
he was in the area?

22:33.936 --> 22:35.153
No.

22:35.563 --> 22:36.735
Find this guy.

22:39.066 --> 22:40.659
We'll be there
before midnight.

22:40.776 --> 22:43.154
Just make sure you're ready to
go, we won't have a lot of time.

22:43.237 --> 22:44.580
I was made.

22:44.655 --> 22:45.952
I'll call you back.

22:46.532 --> 22:49.206
They were looking for me.
How did that happen?

22:49.326 --> 22:50.919
I don't know.
I should kill you.

22:51.078 --> 22:52.375
This is your fault.

22:52.454 --> 22:54.127
If you got made,
it's your screw up.

22:54.248 --> 22:55.248
They knew I was here.

22:55.291 --> 22:58.135
Even if they know you're here,
they don't know why.

22:59.086 --> 23:00.303
We'll do it later.

23:02.089 --> 23:06.139
We can't.
Too much depends on this now.

23:11.473 --> 23:13.191
This has to be done.

23:23.152 --> 23:25.405
You'll be out of the country
before morning.

23:28.616 --> 23:31.916
Once we find whatever it
is we're looking for, then what?

23:32.161 --> 23:33.361
Depends on what we find.

23:33.787 --> 23:36.631
What if it's something that
used to be important back then

23:36.707 --> 23:38.505
but isn't
a very big deal now?

23:38.667 --> 23:40.544
You know, like eyeglasses.

23:40.920 --> 23:41.967
Eyeglasses?

23:42.046 --> 23:43.468
Did you know
the first pair of eyeglasses

23:43.547 --> 23:44.924
was invented in
the 13th century?

23:45.007 --> 23:46.259
I did not.
But the thing is,

23:46.342 --> 23:48.515
nobody knows who actually
invented them.

23:48.594 --> 23:50.437
I mean, the idea of
magnifying an image

23:50.512 --> 23:52.640
using a convex lens,
that goes way back.

23:52.723 --> 23:54.691
But the poor guy
who created the first,

23:54.767 --> 23:57.270
like, wearable pair
gets no credit.

23:57.353 --> 23:59.105
Yeah, I don't think we're
looking for eyeglasses.

23:59.188 --> 24:01.441
Well, that's good.
'Cause I can never find mine.

24:05.194 --> 24:07.117
That's a nice looking
little dorf.

24:09.198 --> 24:10.700
I slept with Adalind.

24:14.328 --> 24:15.500
What?

24:15.871 --> 24:17.339
I just thought
I should tell you.

24:20.125 --> 24:23.299
Okay. I mean, it's not like you
haven't slept with her before.

24:23.379 --> 24:26.223
But this time you, like,
actually knew it was her.

24:27.091 --> 24:28.764
So that probably
made it different.

24:29.635 --> 24:31.729
I mean, did it?

24:35.099 --> 24:38.103
The first time I slept with Adalind
I thought it was Juliette.

24:39.895 --> 24:44.446
And when I slept with Adalind the
other time, it actually was Juliette.

24:45.609 --> 24:47.407
And this time,

24:48.237 --> 24:50.535
I was with
the mother of my child.

24:51.740 --> 24:53.460
So, yeah, I would say
it was very different.

24:55.452 --> 24:56.795
She's changed so much.

24:56.912 --> 24:58.789
Oh, yeah, she has.

25:00.874 --> 25:02.592
I just hope she stays
that way.

25:07.214 --> 25:08.591
You think
you're in love with her?

25:11.218 --> 25:12.515
I don't know.

25:15.764 --> 25:17.141
That's the church.

25:25.983 --> 25:27.326
Yeah, I think it is.

25:28.902 --> 25:30.370
Make a left.

25:44.084 --> 25:47.429
Well, this is the closest Catholic
church to what's on the map.

25:49.048 --> 25:51.392
Looks kind of newer
than I expected.

25:51.467 --> 25:53.561
Well, they've obviously
done a few renovations.

25:53.635 --> 25:55.012
Well, if they've done
renovations

25:55.095 --> 25:57.268
they might have already found
what we're looking for.

26:19.286 --> 26:21.380
Let's see if there's
someone to talk to.

26:22.998 --> 26:24.671
Oh, man.

26:25.125 --> 26:27.344
Empty churches
really give me the creeps.

26:27.503 --> 26:30.507
I always feel like
I'm being observed

26:30.589 --> 26:32.387
by someone who's
not really there.

26:36.512 --> 26:37.889
Hey, you never know.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.316
Well, I'll tell
you one thing.

26:41.391 --> 26:43.610
If this church was originally
built in the 13th century,

26:43.685 --> 26:45.645
whatever we're looking for
has gotta be underneath

26:45.687 --> 26:47.610
because this is way too new.

27:01.370 --> 27:02.542
I don't think
he can hear you.

27:20.222 --> 27:21.895
He just totally made you
as a Grimm.

27:22.975 --> 27:26.275
I am so sorry,
did Gottlob startle you?

27:26.687 --> 27:28.485
He is a dedicated
sacristan,

27:28.564 --> 27:31.488
but he cannot hear anything
and he frightens easily.

27:32.943 --> 27:34.911
You are Americans, yeah?

27:34.987 --> 27:36.330
Yes. I'm Nick...

27:36.405 --> 27:38.282
Frederick Calvert.

27:38.866 --> 27:40.038
Felix Dietrich.

27:46.081 --> 27:48.083
But English is easier.

27:48.458 --> 27:49.880
So, English it is.

27:50.252 --> 27:53.426
How can I help you? Are you here
for confession or just to look?

27:53.505 --> 27:55.633
We're just checking out
the sights of Wolfach,

27:55.716 --> 27:58.139
looking at some of the old
architecture in the Black Forest.

27:58.218 --> 28:01.017
With a particular interest in
some of the older churches.

28:01.471 --> 28:02.563
Yeah, yeah.

28:02.639 --> 28:05.392
It is a beautiful area with
many beautiful churches.

28:05.601 --> 28:08.400
Please, enjoy your time
in the Schwarzwald.

28:08.770 --> 28:11.398
Oh, could you, uh, tell us
how old this church is?

28:12.274 --> 28:15.118
Saint Laurentius
was built in 1594.

28:15.319 --> 28:18.038
It is the oldest church in
Wolfach and, as you can see,

28:18.113 --> 28:20.616
it still retains some
of the original style.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.248
I'm sorry, 1594?

28:24.620 --> 28:26.668
We thought this church
was older than that.

28:26.914 --> 28:29.008
Are there any older
churches in the area?

28:29.249 --> 28:32.298
Yeah. Something more Gothic, you
know, with the pointed arches,

28:32.377 --> 28:34.471
and the ribbed vaults,
maybe a flying buttress?

28:34.630 --> 28:38.351
You are talking about something
from the time of the Crusades.

28:38.425 --> 28:39.722
Yeah, we love that stuff.

28:39.801 --> 28:42.975
I am sorry, you will not find
anything that old near here.

28:43.513 --> 28:45.982
Well, thank you
for your time.

28:46.308 --> 28:50.734
Enjoy our village, and you
are welcome any time.

29:10.874 --> 29:13.252
Well, we're only
off by, like, 300 years.

29:13.794 --> 29:16.422
Church didn't even exist
during the Fourth Crusade.

29:19.299 --> 29:21.552
But this is the church that's
closest to the one on the map.

29:21.635 --> 29:23.308
Then we obviously
made a mistake.

29:23.679 --> 29:25.181
We gotta look
at the map again.

29:27.099 --> 29:29.898
All right. I know this map isn't
even, like, close to scale,

29:29.977 --> 29:33.356
but it clearly shows a church existed
here during the 13th century.

29:33.438 --> 29:34.690
But the map is
two dimensional.

29:35.190 --> 29:36.737
Uh... Yeah, so?

29:36.817 --> 29:39.616
So we're imagining the cross
to be on top of the church.

29:39.736 --> 29:41.033
That's usually how
they're built.

29:41.154 --> 29:45.375
What if that cross, or X really
does just mark the spot?

29:46.159 --> 29:48.958
Meaning the spot would be
further away from Wolfach

29:49.037 --> 29:50.789
than the church
looks on the map.

29:50.872 --> 29:53.000
Closer to the confluence
of these two rivers.

29:53.166 --> 29:55.794
Okay. That means
we're in the wrong place.

29:55.877 --> 29:57.157
We need to look
at the other map.

29:58.714 --> 29:59.931
All right.

30:00.424 --> 30:04.054
This mountain lines up
with that mountain,

30:04.845 --> 30:07.974
And the confluence of the
Wolf and the Kinzig rivers

30:08.056 --> 30:09.399
is right in
the middle of town.

30:09.474 --> 30:11.943
And that cross lines up
with the top of that hill,

30:12.019 --> 30:13.396
that's not too far
out of town.

30:13.729 --> 30:15.652
That makes sense. Right?

30:16.148 --> 30:18.526
Built a church on the high
ground above the village,

30:18.650 --> 30:19.890
before there even
was a village.

30:19.901 --> 30:21.653
But if there was
this ancient church,

30:21.737 --> 30:22.829
somebody would've known
about it.

30:22.904 --> 30:25.532
Right. And that priest
didn't say anything.

30:26.533 --> 30:29.082
Or maybe we're not
looking for a church.

30:29.786 --> 30:32.585
Maybe they just
buried it on top of a hill.

30:34.124 --> 30:35.751
Well, if we're gonna
get out there,

30:35.917 --> 30:37.557
better leave soon.
It's about to get dark.

30:37.586 --> 30:40.556
We're gonna need a shovel
and a couple of lanterns.

30:43.133 --> 30:45.261
Into the woods we go.

32:11.972 --> 32:13.599
Okay, so,
bear right here.

32:15.725 --> 32:18.695
And then right before
this bend, pull over.

32:24.317 --> 32:26.445
About four kilometers
up thataway

32:26.528 --> 32:28.030
should put us at
the top of the hill.

32:29.739 --> 32:30.786
Well, let's go find it.

32:30.866 --> 32:33.415
What if it's like the Ark of the
Covenant, or the Holy Grail,

32:33.493 --> 32:35.621
or I don't know, the Ten
Commandments or something?

32:36.246 --> 32:37.873
Why would they bury
the Ten Commandments?

32:38.290 --> 32:39.917
I don't know. Maybe there's
other commandments

32:40.000 --> 32:41.047
we know nothing about.

32:42.752 --> 32:44.299
Look at this turnout!

32:46.214 --> 32:49.218
This is what
I'm talking about, Portland!

32:50.427 --> 32:54.307
This is the kind of support that
will help make this city great.

32:54.639 --> 32:58.314
So, on election day, tell your
friends, tell your coworkers,

32:58.393 --> 33:00.737
tell anyone who loves
this city

33:00.812 --> 33:03.281
to get out there and
vote for Andrew Dixon.

33:06.193 --> 33:08.036
Let's make our voices heard!

33:19.247 --> 33:20.590
Just a sec.

33:21.500 --> 33:22.592
Who is it?

33:26.755 --> 33:28.475
I'm right in the middle
of work, what is it?

33:28.548 --> 33:31.097
This will just take a minute.
Is there anyone else home?

33:31.259 --> 33:32.431
No.

33:32.511 --> 33:34.684
Whatever it is you're selling,
I'm not interested.

33:34.888 --> 33:37.607
This one's free.

33:37.891 --> 33:40.064
Marwan attacked
a cop in broad daylight.

33:41.102 --> 33:42.149
Why?

33:42.270 --> 33:43.396
Because he recognized him.

33:43.480 --> 33:45.278
But why was Marwan there
in the first place?

33:45.815 --> 33:47.738
All of this guy's attacks
happen during

33:47.817 --> 33:49.069
major political upheavals.

33:49.152 --> 33:51.029
The bombing in London,
the riot in Kiev.

33:51.488 --> 33:53.206
He must have scouted
those locations first.

33:53.281 --> 33:54.658
Well, so maybe
he was scouting.

33:54.741 --> 33:55.993
And he likes crowds.

33:56.660 --> 33:57.912
What's in the area?

33:57.994 --> 33:59.166
Train station's too far.

33:59.246 --> 34:02.295
You got the shopping district,
movie theater, the park.

34:02.958 --> 34:04.631
Hold on. Park.

34:05.835 --> 34:07.132
Isn't the rally there today?

34:07.712 --> 34:10.056
Yeah, but a political rally
for a mayor in Portland?

34:10.130 --> 34:11.849
Little on the small side
for this guy.

34:11.925 --> 34:14.053
Unless his target is
somebody in the crowd.

34:14.803 --> 34:16.976
All right. Rally's about to
start, it's too late to stop it.

34:17.054 --> 34:18.523
Hey, listen,
we could be wrong.

34:18.639 --> 34:20.358
Let's hope,
but I'm calling the Captain.

34:21.643 --> 34:22.860
You've reached
Captain Sean Renard.

34:22.936 --> 34:24.152
Voicemail.
Let's get out there.

34:29.234 --> 34:32.704
Dixon! Dixon! Dixon! Dixon!

34:32.779 --> 34:36.079
Dixon! Dixon! Dixon! Dixon!

34:36.157 --> 34:37.750
Dixon! Dixon!

35:06.521 --> 35:07.568
Look at this.

35:07.647 --> 35:08.648
What is it?

35:08.898 --> 35:10.696
Hanano, seven minutes ago.

35:11.526 --> 35:12.778
He dyed his hair.

35:12.861 --> 35:14.033
He knows he's been made.

35:14.195 --> 35:15.287
Maybe he's on the move.

35:15.363 --> 35:17.457
Let's see where he might be going.
Mark his radius.

35:17.532 --> 35:20.001
Twenty miles an hour is about
as fast as he's going to ride.

35:20.076 --> 35:21.544
Mark it in
10-minute intervals.

35:26.875 --> 35:28.675
That's where he attacked
the cop this morning.

35:28.752 --> 35:30.272
He's headed back in
the same direction.

35:30.545 --> 35:32.388
Let's find out what's
happening in that area.

35:32.547 --> 35:36.051
And now, to
introduce the next mayor of Portland,

35:36.134 --> 35:38.387
Police Captain Sean Renard!

35:45.226 --> 35:46.398
Thank you.

35:46.478 --> 35:49.231
Okay, I know you've all been
waiting to hear from this guy,

35:49.648 --> 35:51.275
but before I hand over
the microphone,

35:51.358 --> 35:52.905
I just want to say
a few words.

35:53.360 --> 35:56.785
Now, for years I've worked alongside
Councilmember Andrew Dixon.

35:56.863 --> 36:00.913
But in the last few months, I really
got to know Andrew Dixon, the man.

36:01.368 --> 36:04.167
I've witnessed firsthand
his integrity under pressure,

36:04.245 --> 36:08.045
his passion for our city, and
the sacrifices that he's made

36:08.124 --> 36:10.468
to make this city
a better place for all of us.

36:12.253 --> 36:14.347
And I can tell you
that his insight

36:14.422 --> 36:17.175
into the real issues
that we face,

36:17.258 --> 36:20.432
his ability to find
common sense solutions,

36:20.512 --> 36:23.391
and his unwavering commitment
to address the needs

36:23.473 --> 36:26.022
of every single community
in this city

36:26.101 --> 36:28.274
is exactly what
Portland needs!

36:32.565 --> 36:34.158
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's my pleasure

36:34.234 --> 36:36.032
to introduce to you
my good friend

36:36.111 --> 36:38.284
and Portland's next mayor,
Andrew Dixon!

36:45.620 --> 36:46.963
Thank you, Sean.

36:49.624 --> 36:51.626
And thank all of you
for coming out today.

36:52.544 --> 36:54.638
Dixon! Dixon!

36:57.465 --> 37:00.890
Did you know that
between 1524 and 1526

37:00.969 --> 37:04.439
over 100,000 German peasants
were killed in these woods?

37:04.597 --> 37:06.395
I did not.
Does that surprise you?

37:06.766 --> 37:08.143
No, I guess not.

37:08.476 --> 37:10.023
It was called
the German Peasants' War.

37:10.145 --> 37:13.115
Peasants were being treated like
crap, so they invoked divine law,

37:13.189 --> 37:16.318
demanding freedom from the oppression
of their landlords and nobles.

37:16.484 --> 37:18.737
So they fled into these
woods for safety

37:18.820 --> 37:21.243
but they all ended up
getting slaughtered anyway.

37:21.322 --> 37:23.745
Imagine, the ground
we're walking on

37:24.033 --> 37:26.661
was once soaked with the blood
of these poor bastards.

37:26.745 --> 37:27.746
You don't say.

37:27.829 --> 37:30.878
Don't you half expect their
ghosts to rise from the ground...

37:30.957 --> 37:32.379
Hey, can you stop?

37:32.792 --> 37:34.339
I think
we're getting close.

37:37.505 --> 37:38.506
Sorry.

37:40.008 --> 37:41.351
There's a rally today.

37:42.677 --> 37:44.179
When?
Now.

37:44.471 --> 37:45.814
There'll be a crowd.
I'm going.

37:45.972 --> 37:47.394
If he's there, don't engage.

37:47.640 --> 37:48.641
What if he has a bomb?

37:48.725 --> 37:51.325
Well, do what you have to. But we
need everyone he's connected to.

37:52.937 --> 37:55.190
No, you got another job.

37:55.857 --> 37:57.359
Where?
Santiago.

37:57.776 --> 37:59.153
Pack your bags.
You're out of here in 30.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.279
They'll fill you in when you get there.
You need me here.

38:01.362 --> 38:02.614
They need you there more.

38:11.581 --> 38:14.460
I grew up 20 minutes
from where we're standing.

38:14.918 --> 38:17.137
And I have a bone-deep
understanding

38:17.212 --> 38:19.635
of the challenges
that we face every day.

38:20.048 --> 38:22.301
And that's why we work
with the city legislature,

38:22.717 --> 38:25.641
to propose bond measures
that fund an infrastructure...

38:25.720 --> 38:28.394
If he's got a device, it's gonna
be in a backpack or a briefcase.

38:28.473 --> 38:29.850
...and sustainable growth.

38:31.059 --> 38:35.155
One that preserves and increases
affordable low-income housing.

38:35.230 --> 38:37.232
We work with
the banking community

38:37.774 --> 38:40.994
to cut through the red tape
that sabotages the process

38:41.110 --> 38:42.987
of becoming
a small-business owner,

38:43.112 --> 38:45.991
fighting for legislation
that incentivizes

38:46.074 --> 38:48.418
the banks and
the credit unions

38:48.493 --> 38:50.666
to loan to new businesses.

38:54.415 --> 38:57.669
As your next mayor, I will make
Portland a city that shines

38:57.752 --> 39:00.505
as an example
of what can be accomplished

39:00.588 --> 39:03.967
when people are given the
opportunity to truly succeed.

39:04.217 --> 39:07.266
And that success,
real success,

39:07.345 --> 39:09.222
will come from
the genuine desire

39:09.305 --> 39:11.933
to see your neighbors
as well as yourselves thrive.

39:12.600 --> 39:14.318
Portland is a great place.

39:14.769 --> 39:16.817
I say we work together
to make it even greater.

39:40.420 --> 39:41.842
Hey, hey!

39:42.463 --> 39:43.806
Oh, my God!

39:46.259 --> 39:49.729
We've got an active shooter,
Lovejoy Fountain Park, one victim!

39:49.804 --> 39:52.478
All available units!
I repeat, all available units!

39:52.640 --> 39:53.892
Andy. Andy!

39:54.100 --> 39:55.818
Everybody, move out!
Paramedics!

39:57.478 --> 39:58.525
Andy, come on,
stay with me.

39:58.605 --> 40:00.482
Over here! Andy.

40:01.566 --> 40:04.410
Well, this is the top.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.038
There's nothing here.

40:07.113 --> 40:08.393
Well,
there's more trees.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.367
Take a look
at that map again.

40:12.243 --> 40:14.086
Good old GPS.

40:15.121 --> 40:20.093
Puts us exactly where X
supposedly marks the spot.

40:20.627 --> 40:23.176
Well, we're dealing
with a very old X.

40:24.881 --> 40:25.973
Hold on.

40:27.216 --> 40:29.014
There's a lot of
rocks over here.

40:30.845 --> 40:33.189
- Does that look weird to you?
- What?

40:34.390 --> 40:36.358
Those rocks look
like they're lined up.

40:40.521 --> 40:42.569
This is like some
kind of pattern?

40:43.024 --> 40:45.072
Yeah, looks like
kind of a rectangle.

40:45.193 --> 40:47.867
Looks like some kind
of Stonehenge thing.

40:49.530 --> 40:51.373
Dude,
that is not a normal rock.

40:51.908 --> 40:53.251
It's squared off.

40:53.326 --> 40:54.886
You think it could've
been a foundation?

40:55.203 --> 40:57.672
I mean, itâ€™s just sunk into
the ground at an odd angle.

40:57.872 --> 40:59.670
Maybe it's what's
left of the church.

41:01.709 --> 41:04.713
Well, if it's squared off on
all sides, it's gotta be.

41:04.837 --> 41:06.305
All right,
see if you can pry it up.

41:52.093 --> 41:54.095
Okay, here we go.

41:55.805 --> 41:57.227
It's loose.

41:59.100 --> 42:01.774
There, look at that.
Chisel marks.

42:01.853 --> 42:03.605
That is definitely
a foundation stone.

42:05.148 --> 42:06.570
Let's check out
the other stones.

42:07.567 --> 42:08.568
You feel that?

42:08.651 --> 42:10.198
Sounds like we might've
dislodged something.

42:10.278 --> 42:11.325
Nick. The ground!

42:11.446 --> 42:12.447
We should go!
