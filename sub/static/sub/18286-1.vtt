02:19.600 --> 02:23.969
Miss Bai, I think we can get food up ahead.

02:25.640 --> 02:27.210
Okay, Let's go see.

02:27.240 --> 02:28.002
Go.

02:31.360 --> 02:32.850
I just want one bowl.

02:32.880 --> 02:34.006
One bowl?

02:34.680 --> 02:37.411
For all of you?

02:49.080 --> 02:52.368
Teacher, I want to go back to Stone City!

02:54.640 --> 02:56.369
We're going to a new school.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.604
We're not going back.

02:59.320 --> 03:01.129
Here, reach out your hands.

03:01.960 --> 03:03.564
No matter what happened before,

03:04.320 --> 03:05.845
we must look ahead.

03:06.440 --> 03:09.011
We are the bravest and strongest.

03:10.720 --> 03:13.166
We're a family, and we'll always
stay together, remember?

03:13.200 --> 03:15.089
Yes!

03:15.280 --> 03:17.044
Food is coming

03:17.560 --> 03:18.482
Dry your tears!

03:20.920 --> 03:23.446
Look, it's Pigsy!

03:31.880 --> 03:32.961
Your noodles

03:33.360 --> 03:33.883
Here it is.

03:33.920 --> 03:34.443
Let's eat!

03:34.600 --> 03:35.726
I want some!

03:35.800 --> 03:36.881
Take it easy.

03:37.000 --> 03:37.842
Waiter!

03:38.160 --> 03:39.924
Sir, do you want the bill'?

03:40.360 --> 03:41.247
It's 10 dollars in total.

03:46.160 --> 03:46.888
This is a robbery!

03:50.640 --> 03:52.085
There's a robbery, run!

03:53.000 --> 03:54.331
If you wish to escape unharmed,

03:54.360 --> 03:57.728
Behave and put all your money on the table.

03:58.640 --> 03:59.402
Listen,

03:59.800 --> 04:01.370
Today our knives will fly.

04:01.400 --> 04:02.208
Your money better flow,

04:02.480 --> 04:03.163
Or else

04:03.640 --> 04:04.243
your blood will flow!

04:04.400 --> 04:05.049
You hear me?

04:06.280 --> 04:07.042
Don't move!

04:14.200 --> 04:17.010
R... robbery

04:21.120 --> 04:22.167
Goddammit!

04:24.000 --> 04:25.650
R... robbery

04:27.040 --> 04:28.280
Come on!

04:28.640 --> 04:30.005
Right now is lunch time!

04:30.200 --> 04:31.929
Everyone is supposed to be eating!

04:32.040 --> 04:34.361
It's so rude to rob us now!

04:34.600 --> 04:36.728
Food comas are very uncomfortable.

04:37.080 --> 04:38.730
I care about my health.

04:39.240 --> 04:41.288
After I eat, I want to sleep.

04:41.320 --> 04:43.641
When I sleep, I hate to be interrupted!

04:44.360 --> 04:46.328
Can't you be a more professional robber'?

04:46.360 --> 04:48.488
You should come back at night for a...

04:48.560 --> 04:50.767
...R-r-robbery.

04:59.960 --> 05:01.644
I'll show you robbery!

05:02.480 --> 05:03.686
I'll show you robbery!

05:07.080 --> 05:08.605
Shouldn't you hide yourself?

05:10.400 --> 05:11.481
You interrupted my nap!

05:11.560 --> 05:13.369
Food comas are very uncomfortable!

05:13.680 --> 05:16.570
Robbing by day is for amateurs!

05:17.440 --> 05:18.726
Come back at night!

05:24.960 --> 05:26.121
I feel much better.

05:41.720 --> 05:42.960
Stay here.

06:27.600 --> 06:29.602
My arm is breaking!

06:29.680 --> 06:32.684
Spare us, Hero!

06:41.080 --> 06:42.730
Bad boys!

06:53.240 --> 06:55.208
Hey Boss, keep the change.

07:06.720 --> 07:08.449
Pigsy is amazing!

07:10.320 --> 07:11.321
For the noodles.

07:14.440 --> 07:15.248
Hero!

07:16.240 --> 07:16.843
Hero?

07:17.200 --> 07:17.883
Who?

07:20.560 --> 07:21.482
Thank you.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.080
Thank you for helping us.

07:26.760 --> 07:28.125
Girls sure are brazen these days.

07:53.120 --> 07:53.882
Mantou,

07:54.480 --> 07:56.767
He's not Pigsy after all.

07:57.040 --> 07:58.371
He's the Monkey King!

08:13.840 --> 08:17.083
In 1914, China was divided by many powers,

08:17.120 --> 08:19.043
And warlords battled one another.

08:19.080 --> 08:22.050
Cao Ying was the most vicious among them.

08:22.080 --> 08:24.003
His army spread fear through slaughter,

08:24.080 --> 08:26.924
and everywhere he conquered became hell on Earth.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.924
People fled for their lives,

08:30.000 --> 08:32.321
losing everything they had.

08:55.720 --> 09:00.806
Pucheng

09:07.240 --> 09:08.605
Sheriff Yang is back!

09:10.320 --> 09:11.367
Sheriff Yang!

09:15.960 --> 09:16.768
Sheriff!

09:19.120 --> 09:20.167
Sheriff is back!

09:20.760 --> 09:21.568
Daddy!

09:21.760 --> 09:23.250
Sheriff is back!

09:27.840 --> 09:29.569
Meal time!

09:29.680 --> 09:30.727
I'm starving.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.245
I have an announcement.

09:34.760 --> 09:37.206
Warlord Cao Ying's army has taken Stone City.

09:37.440 --> 09:39.124
Due to this military emergency, our troops

09:39.160 --> 09:41.401
have been transferred to the front lines.

09:41.840 --> 09:43.490
Pucheng won't have military protection.

09:43.960 --> 09:45.041
For now, they will rely on us, the guardians.

09:48.600 --> 09:49.761
The army has gone to war

09:50.560 --> 09:52.403
while we maintain order.

09:52.960 --> 09:53.882
That's fine!

09:54.480 --> 09:56.608
We have Sheriff Yang to lead us.

09:56.800 --> 09:58.006
Isn't that right?

09:58.800 --> 09:59.210
Yes?

09:59.280 --> 10:00.042
Let's eat!

10:00.080 --> 10:01.730
Time to eat!

10:02.160 --> 10:03.082
Eat up, Sheriff.

10:03.200 --> 10:03.928
Sheriff!

10:04.480 --> 10:05.845
There are many refugees at the gate.

10:06.120 --> 10:07.565
Our villagers won't let them in.

10:07.760 --> 10:09.489
They're kicking up a big fuss!

10:12.040 --> 10:14.247
Stand back, everyone!

10:14.440 --> 10:15.930
Calm down, don't push!

10:17.160 --> 10:19.083
Stand back!

10:19.640 --> 10:20.368
Don't crowd!

10:20.400 --> 10:23.643
No, there is no more room in the city!

10:23.920 --> 10:24.887
Calm down.

10:24.920 --> 10:27.161
Sir, we escaped from Stone City!

10:27.200 --> 10:29.567
The Cao Army took our houses!

10:29.800 --> 10:31.564
We are homeless now!

10:31.600 --> 10:33.329
Please take us in!

10:33.600 --> 10:36.126
Please, we beg you!

10:39.760 --> 10:40.727
Get up now...

10:41.840 --> 10:43.171
Listen to me.

10:43.800 --> 10:48.010
Can you bear to watch refugees wander and starve?

10:50.240 --> 10:52.242
Many of you aren't Pucheng natives

10:52.280 --> 10:55.250
And came during the famine 20 years ago

10:56.480 --> 10:58.084
We accepted you then

10:58.120 --> 10:59.610
And have lived well together.

11:00.280 --> 11:00.883
That's right!

11:01.240 --> 11:02.002
Think about it.

11:02.440 --> 11:04.568
If we Pucheng people were the ones in trouble,

11:04.920 --> 11:06.081
Wouldn't we also want

11:06.160 --> 11:08.686
a temporary place to stay?

11:12.200 --> 11:13.645
Let's obey the Sheriff!

11:14.400 --> 11:15.731
We'll help in any way we can.

11:16.200 --> 11:17.167
All right'?

11:17.680 --> 11:19.125
Yes!

11:20.440 --> 11:21.566
I'll provide bread!

11:21.760 --> 11:22.727
Fellow villagers!

11:22.920 --> 11:24.410
Let's also help them!

11:24.880 --> 11:26.291
Some can stay at my home!

11:26.320 --> 11:27.082
Good!

11:30.400 --> 11:32.004
We'll help in any way we can!

11:36.280 --> 11:37.008
Cousin!

11:41.160 --> 11:42.002
Cousin!

11:42.760 --> 11:43.409
Cousin!

11:44.080 --> 11:44.922
Why are you...?

11:44.960 --> 11:45.768
Cousin!

11:46.480 --> 11:48.084
Let me take her.

11:49.960 --> 11:54.363
Cao soldiers charged into the school and

11:55.280 --> 11:58.090
killed many teachers and students

11:58.680 --> 12:02.082
because Cao Shaolun didn't like us reading.

12:03.760 --> 12:05.410
I saw Cao Shaolun when he killed.

12:05.440 --> 12:06.885
He looked like a demon!

12:08.360 --> 12:11.443
I was able to escape with some of the children.

12:15.920 --> 12:18.082
Teacher Bai, please settle here for now.

12:19.040 --> 12:22.681
We won't let ourselves be bullied.

12:25.800 --> 12:26.961
You'll be fine here.

12:28.240 --> 12:29.287
Once you're in Pucheng

12:29.880 --> 12:30.722
Have no fear!

12:31.320 --> 12:33.641
I'll take good care of you. Don't worry!

12:40.200 --> 12:40.803
Go take a look.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.162
Halt!

13:03.720 --> 13:04.642
What is your purpose here'?

13:04.880 --> 13:05.881
Halt, halt!

13:05.920 --> 13:07.046
Crashing around like that;
do you have a deathwish?

13:08.000 --> 13:08.967
Are you deaf?

13:09.600 --> 13:10.886
They told you to stop!

13:11.120 --> 13:12.167
You ran into people!

13:12.400 --> 13:13.481
What are you up to?

13:14.360 --> 13:15.725
Your city's richest man

13:15.760 --> 13:17.125
Boss Liu invited us here!

13:17.360 --> 13:18.566
Out of our way!

13:20.200 --> 13:22.407
You look like you're up to no good.

13:23.160 --> 13:24.571
Let me tell you,

13:24.600 --> 13:27.206
Everyone who comes here must register.

13:30.960 --> 13:32.325
You forced me into this.

13:32.360 --> 13:33.930
You're just a small local guard!

13:34.320 --> 13:35.401
I'm Wang!

13:35.440 --> 13:36.487
Since this is our first visit,

13:36.680 --> 13:38.682
We will give you a show of force!

13:38.720 --> 13:39.482
Men!

13:40.160 --> 13:40.763
Don't help me!

13:40.800 --> 13:41.801
Yes!

13:46.760 --> 13:47.966
Yes!

13:59.640 --> 14:01.130
This move is called "Eat Dog Poop"!

14:01.160 --> 14:02.286
That's it?

14:02.560 --> 14:03.368
Are you all right?

14:03.880 --> 14:05.609
Of course I'm fine, get him!

14:05.640 --> 14:06.129
Yes, sir!

14:21.440 --> 14:22.885
Stop now!

14:25.360 --> 14:26.441
Boss Liu!

14:28.400 --> 14:30.004
Kenan, please don't misunderstand.

14:30.040 --> 14:32.327
Don't make it worse.

14:32.680 --> 14:35.331
These are protectors I have hired.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.485
That's right.

14:37.560 --> 14:39.801
The army has abandoned your city.

14:39.840 --> 14:41.729
Cao Ying's army might be here any minute.

14:41.760 --> 14:43.330
You know that, don't you?

14:43.760 --> 14:45.683
If not for visionary Boss Liu's

14:45.720 --> 14:47.722
Foresight to hire protectors,

14:47.760 --> 14:49.205
Who will be in charge of our safety?

14:49.840 --> 14:51.285
You guardians?

14:51.320 --> 14:52.560
The few of you?

14:52.880 --> 14:55.008
In real combat, what use are they?

14:56.280 --> 14:57.327
Sheriff Yang!

14:57.800 --> 14:59.484
Why did the army abandon us?

14:59.560 --> 15:02.484
Will the battle begin tomorrow?

15:04.120 --> 15:05.121
Listen to me!

15:06.200 --> 15:07.884
The army has just gone to the front lines.

15:08.280 --> 15:09.725
They did not abandon us.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.240
Don't worry!

15:29.600 --> 15:30.886
Monkey King!

15:30.920 --> 15:32.604
Monkey King?

15:52.480 --> 15:53.970
Taiping!

15:54.600 --> 15:56.011
Taiping...

15:58.600 --> 16:01.490
How many times have I asked you to wake me up?

16:02.080 --> 16:03.320
We've been through this!

16:03.360 --> 16:05.249
You know I'm a lazy pig!

16:05.960 --> 16:07.325
You want me to fall to my death?

16:08.280 --> 16:09.691
I won't buy you any food next time!

16:14.080 --> 16:14.444
All right.

16:14.560 --> 16:15.368
Stand down.

16:16.880 --> 16:17.483
Sure!

16:17.920 --> 16:19.968
Men, do what Boss Liu wants.

16:20.320 --> 16:25.565
Monkey King...

16:26.960 --> 16:31.329
Monkey King...

16:31.400 --> 16:32.481
Quiet!

16:52.360 --> 16:52.963
Let's go.

16:57.320 --> 16:58.970
Boss, trim my beard.

16:59.320 --> 16:59.889
Have a seat.

16:59.920 --> 17:00.250
Sure,

17:00.280 --> 17:01.008
Right away.

17:23.560 --> 17:24.766
What style do you want?

17:25.480 --> 17:26.402
Who are you?

17:26.440 --> 17:27.601
Seems that I don't know you.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.767
I am the Sheriff of Pucheng.

17:32.880 --> 17:35.565
Handlebar, short moustache, goatee...

17:37.360 --> 17:38.327
What style would you like?

17:39.320 --> 17:41.607
Do your best; I'm so handsome anyway.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.841
Miss Bai said you rescued the children.

17:47.880 --> 17:50.008
What is your purpose in Pucheng?

17:50.240 --> 17:51.924
I didn't choose to come.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.642
I go wherever Taiping wants me to.

17:55.960 --> 17:56.927
Taiping?

17:57.160 --> 17:58.002
My horse.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.804
What style are you going to out?

18:01.320 --> 18:02.287
I'm still thinking.

18:04.360 --> 18:05.202
What do you do?

18:05.600 --> 18:06.931
I'd also like to know.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.770
I have nothing to do today and tomorrow.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.689
Hey man, can you concentrate?

18:11.760 --> 18:12.807
Trim my beard.

18:12.920 --> 18:15.651
A wanderer... passing through here?

18:17.000 --> 18:17.842
When are you leaving?

18:18.440 --> 18:19.646
Ask Taiping.

18:21.280 --> 18:22.406
Any ideas?

18:24.800 --> 18:25.608
None yet.

18:26.400 --> 18:27.561
Let me ask you...

18:27.840 --> 18:29.001
How about handlebar mustache?

18:29.040 --> 18:31.407
Would it make me more handsome?

18:32.040 --> 18:34.327
You would look lecherous.

18:35.080 --> 18:36.570
Like a bad guy!

18:38.440 --> 18:42.001
How can you tell who is good or bad?

18:42.480 --> 18:44.403
Bad guys have no morals.

18:45.800 --> 18:48.929
Don't you believe in justice?

18:48.960 --> 18:49.882
Yes.

18:51.160 --> 18:52.286
But believing is not enough.

18:53.280 --> 18:54.486
It must be enforced.

18:55.080 --> 18:57.401
There can be no justice, without enforcement.

18:57.760 --> 18:58.966
I still don't know...

18:59.000 --> 19:00.570
Your name.

19:00.640 --> 19:01.880
I'm Yang Kenan.

19:02.560 --> 19:03.891
"Ke" as in kissing?

19:04.000 --> 19:05.126
"Nan" as in Nancy?

19:07.800 --> 19:09.768
"Ke" as in conquer, "nan" as in hardship.

19:10.760 --> 19:11.568
Honoured.

19:12.600 --> 19:13.647
I'm Ma Fang.

19:16.480 --> 19:17.720
The nation is in chaos,

19:17.760 --> 19:19.285
But not in Pucheng.

19:19.480 --> 19:20.720
You should leave soon.

19:21.880 --> 19:23.006
All I want is simple:

19:23.560 --> 19:24.766
"Taiping" (Peace).

19:24.800 --> 19:26.484
Just like your horse's name.

19:29.320 --> 19:30.924
Remember to register!

19:32.240 --> 19:33.480
You're done?

19:34.000 --> 19:34.842
How much?

19:35.160 --> 19:36.844
Depends on how happy you are!

20:01.880 --> 20:02.881
So handsome!

20:27.600 --> 20:28.567
Hero!

20:37.600 --> 20:38.283
Hero!

20:40.600 --> 20:41.931
Come on!

20:42.880 --> 20:44.848
Can't you let me sleep in peace?

20:45.240 --> 20:46.321
I'm sorry

20:46.360 --> 20:47.850
to interrupt your rest.

20:48.720 --> 20:49.960
We've met.

20:50.360 --> 20:52.840
It's late, but I came to ask you a favour.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.284
I'm Bai Ling, a teacher.

20:56.080 --> 20:56.888
Just stop!

20:57.360 --> 20:58.725
I know what you want.

20:59.200 --> 21:00.611
Let me tell you,

21:01.080 --> 21:03.208
I'm not a loose man.

21:05.160 --> 21:06.366
Don't misunderstand.

21:07.160 --> 21:10.243
I'm taking some orphans to the Capital.

21:10.640 --> 21:12.483
But the route is fraught with danger.

21:12.560 --> 21:15.484
I'd like to ask you to protect us on the way.

21:18.720 --> 21:19.801
Do you know me?

21:21.080 --> 21:22.605
What kind of person am I?

21:23.320 --> 21:24.890
I know you are a good man.

21:28.800 --> 21:29.562
Wrong!

21:30.760 --> 21:33.684
I do everything except what is good.

21:33.720 --> 21:35.449
Please go home.

21:45.120 --> 21:45.962
Hero!

21:47.720 --> 21:49.165
I beg you, please help them!

21:49.400 --> 21:51.050
Their parents have been murdered!

21:51.320 --> 21:52.890
Only you can guarantee their safety

21:53.240 --> 21:54.969
And bring them to their
relatives in the Capital...

21:55.000 --> 21:57.128
Can you please stop talking?

21:57.160 --> 22:00.243
Besides being a bad guy, I'm a very busy man!

22:00.320 --> 22:01.890
Do I look like I have nothing to do?

22:02.880 --> 22:03.642
Hero...

22:03.720 --> 22:05.404
Do you have money?

22:05.840 --> 22:06.807
Money...

22:06.840 --> 22:07.443
Yes!

22:07.600 --> 22:09.250
I'm a very bad, very busy man

22:09.480 --> 22:11.005
who loves money!

22:11.160 --> 22:12.924
I work for money, not for people.

22:13.720 --> 22:15.722
$100 Republic dollars, do you have it?

22:16.640 --> 22:17.482
A hundred?

22:17.560 --> 22:18.641
Do you have it?

22:18.760 --> 22:20.364
If you do, I can help you.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.286
I have an idea.

22:29.320 --> 22:30.845
See if you're interested.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.691
You actually don't look bad.

22:36.880 --> 22:39.451
If you get dressed up and made up

22:39.800 --> 22:40.608
you could be sold at a good price.

22:40.640 --> 22:41.766
I won't disturb you anymore.

22:49.400 --> 22:51.402
I know you want me to give up on this.

22:52.480 --> 22:55.131
Get some rest; good night.

22:58.640 --> 22:59.687
Teacher!

23:01.960 --> 23:04.850
Why must you help those little urchins?

23:29.040 --> 23:29.848
Is she asleep?

23:29.880 --> 23:30.688
Yes.

23:31.760 --> 23:32.682
Look.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.206
That's you.

23:36.600 --> 23:37.567
The hairdo.

23:37.720 --> 23:38.642
Those eyebrows.

23:38.680 --> 23:40.205
Look, a hole.

23:41.040 --> 23:42.883
She has your eyebrows.

24:39.160 --> 24:41.766
Move those into the cart.

24:42.160 --> 24:43.844
We'll have some noodles and get going.

24:50.480 --> 24:51.402
Be careful!

24:51.440 --> 24:52.441
Take your time.

24:52.920 --> 24:53.364
Hurry!

24:53.440 --> 24:54.089
I'll put this here.

24:54.120 --> 24:55.201
Good.

24:55.480 --> 24:56.481
Go inside for noodles.

24:56.560 --> 24:58.244
Yes; let's eat.

25:14.600 --> 25:15.761
Good morning, sir!

25:15.960 --> 25:18.804
You're dressed to go hunting.

25:19.160 --> 25:20.161
Are you lost?

25:20.480 --> 25:21.481
Come in, have a seat.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.722
No one else is open yet.

25:37.080 --> 25:38.127
This way, please.

25:47.480 --> 25:49.130
We just opened; excuse the mess.

25:49.160 --> 25:50.889
The kid is sick, so I slept in a bit.

25:50.920 --> 25:51.842
Please sit down, sir.

25:52.240 --> 25:53.446
There are so many mountain trails

25:53.480 --> 25:55.801
so hunters always get lost around here.

25:56.400 --> 25:58.243
Where are you from?

25:59.840 --> 26:01.410
Did you come from Stone City?

26:02.280 --> 26:03.645
Really!

26:03.960 --> 26:05.883
You're so lucky to have escaped.

26:06.240 --> 26:07.969
Stone City must be hellish now,

26:08.000 --> 26:09.331
Being taken over by Cao.

26:09.360 --> 26:10.805
There's no peace there any more.

26:11.320 --> 26:12.731
That dog of a warlord!

26:13.240 --> 26:14.446
Dog of a warlord?

26:14.480 --> 26:15.925
Isn't Cao Ying a dog of a warlord?

26:16.360 --> 26:17.566
That dog of a warlord's bastard son,

26:17.600 --> 26:18.886
Cao Shaolun, is even more like a bastard!

26:19.080 --> 26:20.570
He's a beast among beasts!

26:21.720 --> 26:23.210
A beast among beasts?

26:23.240 --> 26:24.571
Do you have something against him?

26:25.040 --> 26:25.802
Yes.

26:27.400 --> 26:29.129
My cousin taught at Stone City.

26:29.760 --> 26:31.808
If it weren't for that cold-blooded killer,

26:31.840 --> 26:33.126
that inhuman Cao Shaolun,

26:33.160 --> 26:34.844
All those children wouldn't be orphaned!

26:35.440 --> 26:36.726
My cousin wouldn't suffer such hardship!

26:38.640 --> 26:40.165
Here comes my cousin now.

26:40.200 --> 26:41.406
If you don't believe me, ask her yourself!

26:41.480 --> 26:43.369
She watched the bastard commit murder!

26:52.040 --> 26:53.087
I, Li Tieniu, swear to

26:53.360 --> 26:54.646
Curse him all my life.

26:55.040 --> 26:56.007
May he go to hell when he dies!

26:56.480 --> 26:57.891
May he never be reincarnated!

26:58.280 --> 26:59.122
If he has a son,

26:59.640 --> 27:00.926
May he be cursed!

27:01.200 --> 27:02.361
Cousin, stop it!

27:03.400 --> 27:04.765
Let me talk to him.

27:08.920 --> 27:10.160
I'll make you some noodles!

27:10.200 --> 27:11.486
You must taste Tieniu's beef noodles.

27:11.560 --> 27:12.243
Sure.

27:12.440 --> 27:13.930
No scallions, please.

27:18.480 --> 27:19.686
You know me'?

27:24.400 --> 27:25.208
I do.

27:27.600 --> 27:28.965
Come, have some tea.

27:41.240 --> 27:43.288
I beg you, let them go.

27:44.840 --> 27:45.762
Sit.

27:49.800 --> 27:51.848
Do I look like a murderer of innocents?

28:02.200 --> 28:03.929
Then I'm finished!

28:04.880 --> 28:06.644
If I have a son, will he really be cursed?

28:07.040 --> 28:08.485
What will happen if I have a daughter?

28:09.560 --> 28:10.891
What did I do wrong?

28:12.000 --> 28:14.924
We are ordinary people.

28:15.400 --> 28:17.084
We don't know each other!

28:18.000 --> 28:19.764
Why do you kill people?

28:20.040 --> 28:21.166
Killing people is no big deal.

28:21.640 --> 28:22.880
I've been killing

28:23.160 --> 28:24.571
since I was 8.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.729
My father told me then,

28:26.960 --> 28:28.610
"Son, it's no problem!

28:28.880 --> 28:30.644
Kill whoever you want.

28:30.680 --> 28:32.330
You're Cao Ying's son."

28:37.120 --> 28:38.485
This is nonsense.

28:39.880 --> 28:41.405
You're a teacher and you

28:41.440 --> 28:43.249
don't understand such a simple fact?

28:43.320 --> 28:44.924
How can you teach the next generation?

28:45.400 --> 28:47.721
With brute power there is no justice.

28:47.760 --> 28:50.286
When you have power, others will fear you.

28:51.200 --> 28:53.043
Those who don't...

28:56.120 --> 28:57.963
Only meet with death.

28:59.400 --> 29:00.970
I'll play a game with you.

29:01.440 --> 29:03.124
If I lose I'll leave right away.

29:04.240 --> 29:05.366
If I win...

29:05.960 --> 29:07.962
You all must die.

29:14.240 --> 29:15.605
Let's bet on whether my noodles

29:16.120 --> 29:17.929
will come with scallions.

29:25.320 --> 29:26.651
You choose.

29:28.920 --> 29:30.410
No? Then I'll choose.

29:31.480 --> 29:33.164
Since he has been telling me off,

29:34.400 --> 29:37.927
I'm sure he's put a lot of scallions in it!

29:54.040 --> 29:54.768
Here you are, sir!

29:55.120 --> 29:56.360
Enjoy Tieniu's Beef Noodles

29:56.440 --> 29:57.362
while they're hot!

30:21.080 --> 30:22.445
I don't eat beef!

30:29.400 --> 30:30.845
Go see what's going on!

30:52.040 --> 30:54.042
Run, Dayuan!

30:54.240 --> 30:55.321
Dayuan!

30:55.560 --> 30:56.482
Run fast!

30:56.560 --> 30:57.482
Teacher Bai!

31:00.000 --> 31:00.603
Look!

31:00.680 --> 31:01.681
Run fast!

31:14.840 --> 31:16.683
I'll kill you!

31:17.760 --> 31:19.603
I'll kill you,

31:20.120 --> 31:21.884
you demon!

32:15.120 --> 32:17.009
It's really not my fault!

32:17.800 --> 32:18.449
Hurry, go see!

32:18.480 --> 32:19.447
What was that'?

32:23.200 --> 32:24.122
What's going on?

32:24.480 --> 32:25.766
What's going on?

32:26.840 --> 32:30.606
Teacher Bai...

32:31.920 --> 32:33.763
Teacher Bai...

32:46.880 --> 32:48.928
Murderer!

32:58.920 --> 33:01.446
Murderer; I'll fight you to the death!

33:01.480 --> 33:03.244
He must be punished!

33:11.440 --> 33:13.727
He's a killer; execute him!

33:14.320 --> 33:16.322
It should be done right here!

33:17.840 --> 33:19.410
Quiet, everyone!

33:21.160 --> 33:22.321
This man

33:22.360 --> 33:24.966
came to Pucheng and killed our Tieniu,

33:25.840 --> 33:29.925
A Stone City teacher, and a child today.

33:30.680 --> 33:32.762
Our governor has left the city

33:33.320 --> 33:35.209
So Sheriff Yang

33:35.240 --> 33:38.847
will be in charge of the murderer's trial.

33:45.200 --> 33:46.440
What is your name?

33:46.480 --> 33:47.811
Where did you come from?

33:49.000 --> 33:50.650
Why did you kill those three people?

33:52.800 --> 33:54.643
I just went in to eat noodles

33:55.680 --> 33:57.728
But the kid came and grabbed my gun!

33:58.120 --> 33:59.610
I was going to get it back

34:00.560 --> 34:01.721
but the gun went off!

34:01.760 --> 34:03.649
The boss came to beat me up.

34:04.360 --> 34:05.771
I asked him to stop; he didn't.

34:06.160 --> 34:09.243
I shot and killed him.

34:09.639 --> 34:11.210
I didn't mean to.

34:11.800 --> 34:12.766
Liar!

34:13.719 --> 34:15.848
You did it on purpose; stop arguing!

34:20.560 --> 34:22.960
So you killed all three of them?

34:23.600 --> 34:25.090
They were accidents.

34:25.440 --> 34:27.329
All three murders were accidents?

34:32.639 --> 34:34.369
You won't say your name

34:34.760 --> 34:36.364
Or where you're from.

34:37.800 --> 34:39.643
You're speaking only nonsense.

34:40.679 --> 34:42.011
Since you admit to the murders,

34:42.760 --> 34:44.762
As the Sheriff of Pucheng

34:44.840 --> 34:46.330
I must sentence you, the nameless, to death.

34:47.159 --> 34:48.321
Liao, summon the executioner.

34:48.400 --> 34:49.606
Yes, sir!

34:50.679 --> 34:51.966
According to the law,

34:52.280 --> 34:55.250
This man's dog of a head can be removed

34:55.280 --> 34:56.360
Early tomorrow morning.

34:56.600 --> 34:59.206
Hurrah...

35:06.560 --> 35:07.288
What's this?

35:29.000 --> 35:29.967
Halt!

35:31.720 --> 35:32.721
What is your purpose?

35:33.160 --> 35:34.730
I came to pick up Junior Commandant.

35:34.760 --> 35:36.489
What Junior Commandant? Go!

35:41.160 --> 35:41.968
Go now!

36:08.920 --> 36:11.048
Junior Commandant, I deserve to die

36:11.080 --> 36:12.161
For coming so late!

36:14.040 --> 36:15.371
Please spare us, Junior Commandant!

36:25.480 --> 36:26.891
Is everything all right?

36:27.160 --> 36:29.766
He is the son of General Cao Ying,

36:29.800 --> 36:30.881
Junior Commandant Cao!

36:31.360 --> 36:32.964
What? He's Cao Ying's son?

36:40.320 --> 36:41.128
Release him now!

36:41.680 --> 36:43.170
You're on my turf.

36:43.200 --> 36:44.690
You cannot demand his release.

36:45.360 --> 36:46.805
So what if Cao Ying is his father?

36:47.640 --> 36:49.085
He is a murderer.

36:49.360 --> 36:50.441
He will be executed tomorrow morning.

36:51.440 --> 36:53.010
My army will arrive tomorrow.

36:53.960 --> 36:55.689
When General Cao takes over Pucheng,

36:56.080 --> 36:57.127
We will be the law.

36:58.000 --> 36:58.728
Release him!

37:00.360 --> 37:01.964
We'll talk when you've fought your way in.

37:02.840 --> 37:04.171
If you dare to steal him away,

37:05.160 --> 37:06.685
I will execute him on the spot.

37:06.720 --> 37:08.210
Stop it, don't be reckless!

37:08.560 --> 37:09.766
Don't you dare!

37:09.800 --> 37:10.881
Try us.

37:13.720 --> 37:15.051
May I remind you,

37:15.360 --> 37:16.441
If he dies,

37:17.480 --> 37:19.801
The entire city will be buried with him!

37:22.200 --> 37:23.361
Colonel Zhang,

37:23.680 --> 37:25.409
Those who break the law must be punished.

37:26.640 --> 37:28.927
Even I, the Junior Commandant.

37:32.720 --> 37:33.846
Put down your guns!

37:36.640 --> 37:37.641
Go back.

37:43.640 --> 37:44.880
Yes, sir.

37:49.960 --> 37:51.371
You only have one day's time.

37:57.960 --> 37:59.325
Listen carefully!

37:59.920 --> 38:01.001
Tomorrow morning,

38:01.360 --> 38:02.964
I will lead the army into the city for him.

38:03.920 --> 38:06.161
If even a hair is missing on his head,

38:07.040 --> 38:08.121
This whole city

38:08.480 --> 38:09.720
will be covered with corpses

38:10.360 --> 38:11.486
And the rivers dyed red with blood!

38:54.360 --> 38:56.044
I'll play a game with you:

38:56.640 --> 38:57.880
In one day,

38:57.920 --> 39:00.651
I want you to release me with your own hands.

39:03.240 --> 39:03.923
Lock him up!

39:11.480 --> 39:13.960
What do we do now?

39:14.000 --> 39:15.286
Everyone, don't worry.

39:15.320 --> 39:16.128
Calm down.

39:16.160 --> 39:16.888
Kenan!

39:17.680 --> 39:18.647
Kenan!

39:18.680 --> 39:22.082
I think we should probably let him go.

39:22.760 --> 39:24.762
He is Cao Ying's son...

39:24.800 --> 39:26.564
The Junior Commandant!

39:27.040 --> 39:29.441
If we kowtowed and apologized,

39:29.720 --> 39:30.209
Perhaps...

39:30.240 --> 39:31.002
No!

39:31.560 --> 39:34.723
He's a murderer who will be executed tomorrow!

39:38.240 --> 39:40.607
Since that is how you feel,

39:40.640 --> 39:41.448
Kenan,

39:41.800 --> 39:43.165
I'm not going to die

39:43.360 --> 39:44.646
with you.

39:51.120 --> 39:52.485
Out of the way!

39:52.560 --> 39:53.482
What are you looking at?

39:53.560 --> 39:55.130
Go home and wait to die!

40:00.960 --> 40:03.122
I'll notify the army to back us up.

40:03.840 --> 40:04.921
Don't worry,

40:05.680 --> 40:06.806
Go home now.

40:22.480 --> 40:23.288
Colonel,

40:23.480 --> 40:24.925
Why didn't we grab Junior Commandant?

40:25.560 --> 40:27.927
If anything goes wrong, we'll die.

40:30.040 --> 40:32.281
Don't you know what kind of man he is?

40:33.840 --> 40:35.888
If he's having fun he won't stop.

40:37.400 --> 40:40.165
If he wanted them dead
we would have killed them already.

40:42.080 --> 40:44.890
Besides we want to reign a city,

40:44.920 --> 40:46.331
Not destroy it.

40:47.880 --> 40:49.609
They won't harm Junior Commandant.

40:51.920 --> 40:53.251
Come with me tomorrow morning to get him.

40:53.320 --> 40:54.003
But...

40:54.040 --> 40:55.007
Say no more!

40:57.840 --> 40:58.682
Bullocks!

40:59.680 --> 41:01.444
He thinks he's Commander pet.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.364
If anything happens to Junior,

41:04.120 --> 41:05.963
We will be the ones to die, not he.

41:06.120 --> 41:06.848
Yes.

41:07.160 --> 41:09.606
What's so scary about local guardians?

41:27.760 --> 41:29.285
Are you leaving now?

41:29.800 --> 41:31.768
Why would I stay?

41:39.360 --> 41:40.691
Here is a letter.

41:40.720 --> 41:42.927
I found it among Miss Bai's things.

41:43.360 --> 41:44.486
Sorry,

41:44.840 --> 41:46.888
It didn't have an envelope, so I opened it.

41:47.480 --> 41:48.891
The letter is for you.

41:59.440 --> 42:02.250
The children are now with the Guardians.

42:17.680 --> 42:18.408
Hero,

42:19.120 --> 42:21.361
You've helped us before,

42:21.400 --> 42:23.721
Sol know you have feelings.

42:24.440 --> 42:27.603
I didn't mean to interfere with your wanderings,

42:28.560 --> 42:29.766
But as a teacher

42:30.280 --> 42:32.851
I cannot leave my students in mortal danger.

42:33.720 --> 42:36.644
Unfortunately, I am weak and alone

42:36.680 --> 42:37.886
and unable to handle the prospect.

42:38.400 --> 42:39.845
I was desperate for a long time.

42:39.880 --> 42:41.120
I am writing this letter to you.

42:41.920 --> 42:46.005
Please take them safely to the Capital.

42:47.040 --> 42:48.724
I am willing to be your slave
for the rest of my life,

42:49.240 --> 42:50.287
Waiting on you hand and foot

42:50.640 --> 42:51.926
And doing all your bidding

42:52.440 --> 42:54.886
To make up for your $100 fee.

42:56.040 --> 42:57.326
Talk is cheap,

42:57.720 --> 42:59.324
So this letter shall serve as evidence

43:00.120 --> 43:02.009
Bai Ling bows to you.

43:37.600 --> 43:38.567
Sheriff,

43:38.720 --> 43:40.404
You have arrested the murderer for Bai Ling.

43:41.160 --> 43:42.241
I drink to you.

43:43.200 --> 43:44.565
I don't drink while on duty.

43:45.840 --> 43:47.001
Just one drink!

43:48.960 --> 43:50.007
I'll toast with tea.

43:55.720 --> 43:56.721
So stubborn!

44:00.720 --> 44:03.291
Let me ask you,

44:05.360 --> 44:06.885
This decision you made today...

44:08.440 --> 44:10.602
Aren't you afraid of harming your family?

44:12.560 --> 44:13.721
I am.

44:14.480 --> 44:17.131
And that's why I must not back down.

44:24.760 --> 44:26.808
The colonel who came today...

44:28.840 --> 44:29.727
We studied under the same Master.

44:30.160 --> 44:31.002
His name is Zhang Yi.

44:31.560 --> 44:32.243
He is

44:32.320 --> 44:33.446
a man of his word and

44:33.480 --> 44:34.447
a martial arts expert.

44:34.880 --> 44:35.927
You're no match for him.

44:36.760 --> 44:37.886
So what?

44:38.680 --> 44:39.886
Do you think I'll just give up like that?

44:41.280 --> 44:42.884
What about those three lives?

44:44.040 --> 44:45.769
Then why did you toast me earlier?

44:48.960 --> 44:50.291
One lives

44:51.360 --> 44:52.566
through one's conscience.

45:12.800 --> 45:13.847
I will bring the children

45:14.640 --> 45:16.165
to the Capital.

45:17.880 --> 45:18.847
You will?

45:19.080 --> 45:19.763
Yes.

45:24.000 --> 45:24.967
Because...

45:25.040 --> 45:26.326
One time, I received...

45:26.600 --> 45:27.761
a request I couldn't refuse.

45:31.880 --> 45:32.881
A test of one's conscience.

45:34.280 --> 45:36.009
I have to go out for a while, will be back soon.

45:40.640 --> 45:44.565
Be careful it doesn't catch fire!

45:47.560 --> 45:51.610
See that it doesn't catch fire!

46:02.000 --> 46:02.808
Don't you not want this?

46:12.040 --> 46:13.246
I see your forehead is dark,

46:13.320 --> 46:15.004
Nose hair is too long; ears stick out too much.

46:15.600 --> 46:17.090
You won't live past tonight.

46:23.960 --> 46:25.086
You don't believe me?

46:27.800 --> 46:29.131
Then never mind!

46:48.400 --> 46:49.447
Prison raid!

47:15.560 --> 47:16.402
Where is Junior Commandant?

47:16.800 --> 47:17.801
In hell!

47:17.960 --> 47:18.927
In hell?

47:25.200 --> 47:25.849
Guang!

48:36.640 --> 48:37.926
Release Junior Commandant!

49:34.360 --> 49:35.043
Shun!

50:21.840 --> 50:22.443
What is it?

50:22.560 --> 50:24.005
They are coming to raid the prison!

50:28.640 --> 50:29.323
Let's go!

50:42.680 --> 50:43.488
Don't go after them!

50:43.560 --> 50:44.846
Save Guang first!

50:48.600 --> 50:50.125
Guang!

50:53.880 --> 50:55.325
Guang!

51:17.480 --> 51:18.083
I'm going to kill him!

51:18.120 --> 51:18.962
Zhang Wu!

51:23.600 --> 51:24.681
Wu!

52:04.200 --> 52:06.123
Let him down now!

52:06.800 --> 52:07.323
Now!

52:09.080 --> 52:10.127
Lift him up!

52:10.160 --> 52:11.047
Let him down; quickly!

52:12.040 --> 52:13.246
He cannot die!

52:13.560 --> 52:14.641
Down!

52:16.440 --> 52:18.920
Wake up... you can't die!

52:18.960 --> 52:20.291
Wake up!

52:30.400 --> 52:31.731
So now I can't die?

52:34.800 --> 52:37.041
That look on your face...

52:46.720 --> 52:48.882
Why the hurry to hang yourself?

52:48.920 --> 52:50.809
I would have granted your wish tomorrow.

52:56.920 --> 52:57.762
Tomorrow

52:57.840 --> 52:59.922
At least half the people here will die.

53:13.600 --> 53:14.249
Halt!

53:14.480 --> 53:15.481
Who are you?

53:18.600 --> 53:19.362
Colonel,

53:19.440 --> 53:20.646
You have a visitor outside the tent.

53:21.120 --> 53:21.803
Bring him in.

53:22.160 --> 53:22.729
Yes, sir.

53:53.960 --> 53:54.688
Yi.

54:10.320 --> 54:11.128
It seems

54:12.480 --> 54:14.209
You have been very free these years.

54:14.680 --> 54:15.567
It's been all right.

54:19.680 --> 54:21.409
The facial hair

54:22.440 --> 54:23.282
suits you.

54:23.920 --> 54:24.842
Thank you.

54:25.560 --> 54:28.086
I can win on looks if not by fighting.

54:28.720 --> 54:29.721
Shameless!

54:29.800 --> 54:30.801
You don't believe me?

54:31.560 --> 54:32.766
Wanna try and see?

54:35.840 --> 54:36.841
Try and see?

54:38.560 --> 54:40.847
No one has dared to speak to me like this!

54:41.400 --> 54:42.208
You're bold.

54:42.240 --> 54:43.366
Of course.

54:43.400 --> 54:46.210
You're now the high and mighty

54:46.280 --> 54:47.281
Colonel Zhang.

54:48.000 --> 54:49.764
Who would dare to joke with you?

54:52.480 --> 54:54.642
Look at these two dragons.

54:55.600 --> 54:57.443
You've achieved your goal.

54:59.000 --> 55:00.968
This is just the start.

55:01.680 --> 55:03.250
I want to go further.

55:04.440 --> 55:05.362
Congratuations.

55:06.360 --> 55:07.009
And you?

55:07.440 --> 55:08.726
Your grand wanderings...

55:09.040 --> 55:10.041
How are they going?

55:10.960 --> 55:12.450
I just started.

55:13.160 --> 55:14.685
I want to see how far I will go.

55:15.200 --> 55:17.202
I already asked you to make a new world with me.

55:17.240 --> 55:18.321
But you wouldn't listen.

55:18.360 --> 55:19.486
Come work for me.

55:20.840 --> 55:22.171
Work for you?

55:22.800 --> 55:23.926
Doing what?

55:24.040 --> 55:25.246
Be a battalion commander for now.

55:25.800 --> 55:27.245
After a few battles,

55:27.400 --> 55:28.606
I will give you

55:28.760 --> 55:29.841
My rank of colonel.

55:30.120 --> 55:31.360
Battalion Commander sounds good.

55:33.560 --> 55:34.686
Battalion Commander...

55:35.760 --> 55:37.285
Does a battalion commander have to...

55:37.360 --> 55:38.600
Fight and kill

55:39.640 --> 55:41.130
From here...

55:41.160 --> 55:42.605
To here

55:43.040 --> 55:45.691
And then to here...

55:46.680 --> 55:48.045
Pucheng.

55:48.640 --> 55:49.766
Speaking of Pucheng,

55:50.360 --> 55:52.203
I pity the residents there.

55:52.800 --> 55:54.882
They'll all be dead tomorrow, right?

56:02.800 --> 56:03.767
I've already said

56:04.120 --> 56:05.406
To let the Junior Commandant go,

56:05.680 --> 56:08.001
And Pucheng residents will be unscathed.

56:09.960 --> 56:11.883
That Junior Commander of yours is a murderer!

56:12.440 --> 56:13.771
He killed three people.

56:14.440 --> 56:15.407
Two adults

56:15.800 --> 56:18.201
and an innocent child.

56:18.240 --> 56:19.730
Forget about 3 people!

56:20.880 --> 56:22.245
Even if he killed 300 people

56:22.280 --> 56:23.441
I must protect him!

56:23.480 --> 56:24.641
It's my job.

56:26.680 --> 56:28.728
I just don't want to see innocent people die.

56:29.000 --> 56:29.808
Exactly.

56:30.680 --> 56:33.445
Neither do I; so

56:33.800 --> 56:35.450
I'm giving them one day's time.

56:36.600 --> 56:37.726
Shall we take the side of justice...

56:37.760 --> 56:39.330
Don't talk to me about justice!

56:39.640 --> 56:41.768
Have you forgotten you ruined our business?

56:41.960 --> 56:43.485
Because of what you thought was justice,

56:43.840 --> 56:45.842
That dog of an official burned down our business!

56:46.320 --> 56:47.685
Our men became homeless,

56:47.720 --> 56:48.881
And many died or were injured.

56:48.960 --> 56:50.769
Have you forgotten that already?

56:56.400 --> 56:57.731
I remember.

57:18.080 --> 57:19.366
Do you have a deathwish?

57:19.400 --> 57:21.721
Robbing us with no martial arts skills.

57:22.320 --> 57:23.685
I'm not robbing you.

57:24.000 --> 57:25.161
Gods!

57:26.120 --> 57:28.009
Do you not have a sense of justice?

57:28.360 --> 57:29.566
That dog of an official

57:29.760 --> 57:31.364
Cheated me out of my money,

57:31.800 --> 57:33.484
Killed my parents,

57:34.040 --> 57:35.963
Took my wife...

57:36.320 --> 57:38.846
Give me back my wife!

57:39.200 --> 57:40.122
You dog of an official!

57:40.400 --> 57:42.402
Even if I fail in revenge,

57:42.720 --> 57:45.246
I will haunt you after my death!

57:47.840 --> 57:49.490
You can still escape now.

57:54.920 --> 57:56.206
Husband!

58:00.880 --> 58:01.563
Husband!

58:01.760 --> 58:02.841
Wife!

58:03.280 --> 58:04.247
Dog of an official!

58:04.360 --> 58:05.930
I'm going to kill you!

58:06.160 --> 58:07.491
Yi, ignore him.

58:18.400 --> 58:19.401
Scumbag!

58:21.960 --> 58:23.121
You may not kill him!

58:27.760 --> 58:28.727
You're crazy!

58:29.560 --> 58:30.686
If we escort him safely, the guards live.

58:31.120 --> 58:32.451
If not, the guards die.

58:32.960 --> 58:35.327
So we guards can ignore right from wrong

58:37.040 --> 58:39.327
And let this scumbag go free?

58:41.200 --> 58:42.611
If you kill him,

58:43.240 --> 58:45.288
over 300 of us in the company

58:46.080 --> 58:47.206
Will die!

58:58.600 --> 58:59.647
Feng

59:00.480 --> 59:01.925
That is reality.

59:20.320 --> 59:22.322
Brute force beats reason every time

59:39.840 --> 59:40.602
Yi,

59:41.040 --> 59:42.405
What results from this reality?

59:42.840 --> 59:45.650
Those bastard officials always demand payback.

59:46.160 --> 59:48.128
If you still consider me your senior classmate,

59:49.480 --> 59:50.970
Do not be my enemy.

59:57.800 --> 59:59.290
Thanks for the egg.

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:03.682
Feng!

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:07.325
Ask them to release him.

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:32.449
Junior Commandant...

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:33.447
I'm Ma Feng.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:35.164
Here to rescue you under Colonel Zhang's orders!

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:47.687
So, sir?

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.081
I have a question.

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:50.451
Please don't mind; I'm just curious.

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:52.322
So...

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.686
After you get out,

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:55.969
What will you do?

01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:58.005
Will you spare the people of Pucheng?

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:07.201
You think I'm an idiot?

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:08.761
After all that killing,

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:10.286
Your clothes are still white,

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:12.964
But your heart is definitely black.

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:14.962
Are you letting me go?

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:17.845
Yet another dog of an official!

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:53.962
He seems to mean for you to free him.

01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:59.330
Now you understand.

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:04.288
He's not worried if we'll let him go,

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:12.644
He just loves to kill.

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:14.730
If we let him go now,

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:17.801
We'd be giving him our lives unconditionally.

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:21.408
I hope the army will win on the front lines

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:22.601
And return soon.

01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:24.923
Only then will Pucheng's people be rescued.

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:26.926
Such crystal-clear vision!

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:29.005
But you will die, with or without

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:30.963
clear vision.

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:32.807
It will be dawn soon.

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:38.970
I don't know you,

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:42.646
But if you want to play a game

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:44.205
I'll join you.

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:18.045
Liao, you're here.

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:33.448
Liao,

01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:36.603
Bao said you needed to see me urgently.

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:37.402
What is it?

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:38.043
Yes...

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:40.327
Come with me.

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:40.883
Where to?

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:42.486
Let's talk as we walk.

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.000
So much has happened today.

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:53.041
I'll bet you haven't eaten.

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:54.127
Have a pastry.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.129
Why are you so secretive?

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:00.610
No; let's go.

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:03.241
In all the years I've known you,

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:06.442
Your stomach aches when you're nervous.

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:09.891
What is it?

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:15.290
Boss Liu wants to talk to you.

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:18.964
He has a way to resolve this crisis.

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:30.364
When did you meet with him?

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:32.891
His idea is

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:35.129
for me to release Cao Shaolun?

01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:37.690
You wouldn't believe him, would you?

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:41.091
Trust me this once.

01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:44.771
We've risked our lives together all these years.

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:47.361
Everything I do is for your good!

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:50.367
I trust you.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.331
But I won't do this.

01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:57.848
Cao Shaolun is not a regular guy!

01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:59.160
Who is his father?

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:00.201
A grand warlord!

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:01.605
With hundreds of thousands of troops!

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:02.402
And you?

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:04.010
Just a local guardian!

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:07.089
With the few of us; we're no match!

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:09.043
We can't afford this!

01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:11.891
Guang is dead; I fear you may be next.

01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:12.967
You fear you may be next!

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.924
You want me, a guardian, to release a murderer?

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.764
I didn't think you'd be the biggest coward.

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:20.966
I'm not afraid!

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.684
I want to save you!

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:25.042
I've been with you 30 years!

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:26.605
I've done everything you said!

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:29.206
I don't even mind being called a coward.

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:30.127
Because...

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:32.202
I trust you; you're my leader!

01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:33.969
I'll obey you in everything!

01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:35.924
But this time you must obey me!

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:37.446
Release him!

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:39.687
Someone told me the first day I became a guardian

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:41.444
A guardian doesn't have to be very learned,

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:43.323
But he must tell black from white.

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:45.129
Right from wrong.

01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:46.889
Do you remember who told me that?

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:49.000
You did.

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:50.960
I trusted you, too.

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.368
But many people will die!

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:56.883
Is that worth it, for one Cao Shaolun?

01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:01.731
Ask the people what they want.

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:04.242
Don't lecture them on justice

01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:05.725
or intergrity!

01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:08.761
Everyone just wants peace...

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:11.567
To have a safe home and good job.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.685
Don't give them a hard time!

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:21.046
You think we can solve everything

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:23.003
if we kneel down.

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:26.007
Just kneel first.

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:29.846
It's critical to stay alive!

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:39.610
If we kneel today,

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:42.404
Will we still be able to stand up tomorrow?

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:43.566
Can our future generations

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:46.490
live with their heads held high?

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.690
We are not slaves.

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:52.003
We are the owners of Pucheng.

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.929
The more we fear, the worse our fate.

01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:04.322
Cao Shaolun's arrival into our city

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:09.209
has sealed Pucheng's fate.

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:12.961
There is no escape for us.

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:16.403
Yes,

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:18.805
We may die,

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:23.450
But everyone dies.

01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:26.567
Let's not die in vain.

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:29.965
All right?

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:48.966
Yang Kenan!

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:10.126
What do you want?

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:12.004
Boss Liu invited us here!

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:13.640
You still don't understand?

01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:15.967
Sub-commander Liao

01:08:16.439 --> 01:08:18.408
Your job is done; go!

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:20.450
Boss Liu said you must pay for your mistakes

01:08:21.279 --> 01:08:22.406
by killing him!

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:24.921
Yang

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:27.611
Don't put the blame on us in the underworld.

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:29.450
We're just doing our jobs.

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:34.127
Kill me first, if you can!

01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:20.727
Leave me!

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:23.847
Go!

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.240
Sheriff!

01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:56.881
Liao!

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:04.050
You wouldn't go when I asked,

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:06.963
Sol must send you out!

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:19.842
Out of my way!

01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:20.767
Leave me!

01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:23.161
Wu!

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:25.808
Calm down!

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:27.046
Let go!

01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:28.002
Out of my way!

01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:28.723
Leave me alone!

01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:29.124
Wu!

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:29.843
All of you, let go!

01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:32.690
Calm down, it's useless!

01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:42.611
Why are you all standing here?

01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:44.288
Liu Cheng!

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.286
You sent men to kill Liao!

01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:47.606
I want your life for this!

01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:48.723
Wrong!

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:49.881
I'll tell you what happened.

01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:52.648
Yang offended Junior Commandant,

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:54.165
Caused the death of his man.

01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:59.246
And will kill all of us in Pucheng

01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:02.280
Listen to what the people are saying!

01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:20.086
Sheriff Yang,

01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:21.850
Once the Cao army storms the city,

01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:24.801
They will kill everyone

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:26.730
in the city!

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.047
Sheriff Yang

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:32.367
I beg you.

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:34.764
Can you let the Junior Commandant go?

01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:37.682
Please; Let him go!

01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:40.881
Kenan,

01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:43.289
My son is still young!

01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:46.210
I just want him to grow up in peace!

01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:49.048
You don't want to see your daughter

01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:51.401
killed by Cao's army tomorrow, do you?

01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:00.005
I am devastated

01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:03.442
by the deaths of Liao and Guang.

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:06.291
But this is not for revenge.

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:10.728
I believe murderers should be punished.

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:12.166
But, Sheriff Yang!

01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:13.925
What about us?

01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:31.804
Sheriff Yang!

01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:42.444
Sheriff Yang!

01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:48.362
My family has lived here for 5 generations.

01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:51.002
I am already in my eighties.

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:52.931
I beg you!

01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:56.202
Please let my descendants live!

01:17:56.240 --> 01:18:00.086
I beg you, give it up!

01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:36.321
Father!

01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:36.963
Mother!

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.048
Please get UP!

01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:41.970
Kneel with us and beg Sheriff Yang.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.411
Beg Sheriff Yang!

01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:45.044
Kneel down!

01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:48.606
Sheriff,

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:51.366
I...

01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:37.051
There is righteousness among the people.

01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:39.884
Justice is in everyone's hearts.

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:45.083
We Yangs have been guardians here
for 3 generations.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.083
We have been loyal and faithful;
our consciences are clear.

01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:52.449
Today, you don't need me anymore.

01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:55.009
I understand your fear.

01:19:58.400 --> 01:19:59.447
Before daybreak...

01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:01.770
I will resign as your Sheriff.

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:06.204
You all decide whether to let him go.

01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:10.362
The Guardians...

01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:13.285
are permenantly dismissed.

01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:56.290
Xianger will love Guangzhou.

01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:58.609
She will get to know many new schoolmates.

01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:01.883
Give the men an extra month's pay.

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:21.284
You're staying here by yourself?

01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:23.280
Is that useful?

01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:25.646
I'm the one he wants.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:26.922
With me here...

01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:29.449
He won't vent his anger on the people.

01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:32.968
I'm sorry.

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:41.805
Junior Commandant!

01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:44.447
Come on out!

01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:46.046
We're sorry!

01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:47.650
We're releasing you.

01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:50.887
Cut it open now!

01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:53.361
You may not open it.

01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:55.211
Please be serious, sir.

01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:56.289
Junior Commandant,

01:21:57.760 --> 01:21:59.205
Please come out!

01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:01.967
Please forgive us, come out!

01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:04.081
Junior Commandant...

01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:06.329
Junior Commandant!

01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:09.967
We all know that we were wrong!

01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:17.208
Daddy!

01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:21.168
You promised to play hide-and-seek
at Grandma's house.

01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:23.771
I'll wait for you; hurry up!

01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:26.401
I'll be very quick.

01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:28.323
Show me a punch.

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:29.043
Strike!

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:33.164
Really good!

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:34.241
That was so fast

01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:36.009
Daddy couldn't even see your fist.

01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:37.121
But it hurts a little.

01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:39.006
Give me a kiss.

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:40.843
One more.

01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:43.448
And one more.

01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:08.961
Sheriff!

01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:10.890
We don't care where you go,

01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:12.684
We just want to follow you.

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:14.645
What for?

01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:16.285
All good things must come to an end.

01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:18.888
You think I want to lead you monkeys around?

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:19.882
Go on.

01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:22.404
We're leaving.

01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:29.321
Sheriff.

01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:35.403
Thank you for all these years of care.

01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:37.966
I hope to have a chance

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:40.130
to repay you.

01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:49.688
Go.

01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:53.128
Take care.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.081
Sheriff Yang,

01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:53.771
They're leaving; why are you still here?

01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:56.720
I have an extra seat; I could give you a lift.

01:24:57.920 --> 01:24:59.365
Why do I need a lift from you?

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.240
Just take the children.

01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:06.491
You're really staying?

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:11.762
Yes.

01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:14.450
Knowing you will lose?

01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:16.290
I didn't do anything wrong

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:17.446
So what will I lose?

01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:39.722
Junior Commandant!

01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:41.842
Please forgive us for being late!

01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:43.890
Men, open the lock!

01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:47.243
It's not for you to open.

01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:49.361
Forgive me, Junior Commandant!

01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:54.208
If you were not one of my father's dogs

01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:55.480
I would have killed you long ago.

01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:57.561
Whoever cuffed me

01:26:57.600 --> 01:26:59.329
Will be the one to release me.

01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:00.721
Yes, Junior Commandant!

01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:03.802
Men!

01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:04.762
Bring Yang Kenan!

01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:06.046
I am here.

01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:19.326
Sheriff Yang...

01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:04.842
Come on.

01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:19.922
Well?

01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:22.165
Is the executioner here?

01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:24.490
I think he's lost his way.

01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:27.489
You need an executioner to chop off my head?

01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:29.005
My head is right here.

01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:32.246
Cut it off.

01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:37.046
Cut it off!

01:28:57.880 --> 01:28:59.405
How many hundred lives

01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:04.441
may I exchange with my life?

01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:09.004
I'm giving you my head, yet you won't cut!

01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:11.242
Fine.

01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:14.285
You want to defend the people so badly

01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:15.367
And you want to die so badly.

01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:16.807
I'll grant your wish.

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:19.927
Tie him up.

01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:21.082
Let me

01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:22.406
toy with him.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.161
Cheers!

01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:37.890
Junior Commandant is handsome and smart!

01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:39.160
Impressive!

01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:41.567
Truly a shining young hero!

01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:44.763
Thank you for gracing my home

01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:46.689
With your presence!

01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:48.722
I am so honoured.

01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:50.686
We are family from now on.

01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:52.165
I will do anything for you.

01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:00.726
Sir...

01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:03.081
Eat when you eat; stop talking.

01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:05.243
Let's eat!

01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:07.361
Please, eat!

01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:10.481
Oh, you're really eating?

01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:19.609
Let's go look over there.

01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:26.928
No... don't take that...

01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:36.568
Don't take it...

01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:46.761
Xianger, you're a good girl.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.445
When you grow up

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:52.962
I'm sure you'll be a brave, heroic person.

01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:57.049
Go to Grandma's house with Jiaoer.

01:30:57.480 --> 01:30:58.845
I'll go be with Daddy.

01:30:58.880 --> 01:30:59.688
All right'?

01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:23.560
Teachers!

01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:25.682
You're safe now; come.

01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:29.884
Miss Bai and Dayuan are dead!

01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:33.447
Teachers!

01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:35.851
I hand over these rascals to you.

01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:41.007
Monkey King!

01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:44.050
Don't go!

01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:45.402
Stop crying!

01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:47.722
Listen.

01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:53.728
Grow up to be good people, you hear?

01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:55.683
Yes, sir!

01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:04.327
Where are you going, Monkey King?

01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:08.367
To fight monsters!

01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:32.085
Madam Yang, we're back!

01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:07.207
Ma Feng

01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:08.686
You've returned, too?

01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:11.849
I don't charge a fee

01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:13.925
For some things that must be done.

01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:20.167
Well?

01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:22.248
Isn't it fun to drink wine upside-down?

01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:33.280
I told you last night, half of Pucheng will die.

01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:35.641
Now, I want everyone to die.

01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:37.245
And you'll be the last one!

01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:38.281
So, hang in there.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:43.762
Release.

01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:53.483
Halt!

01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:55.162
Who are you?

01:34:56.880 --> 01:34:58.689
I bring a gift to Junior Commandant.

01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:00.408
What gift?

01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:02.088
Let me see it!

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:04.967
You may see it,

01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:07.125
But I'm afraid your rank isn't high enough.

01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:08.602
It's very...

01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:10.803
very confidential.

01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:17.091
If you insist, I'll show it to you.

01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:20.647
I'm going to show you now.

01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:23.202
You really want to see it?

01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:31.210
Bring him to Junior Commandant, take his weapons!

01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:35.161
Quickly...

01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:39.322
Cheers!

01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:48.481
What's wrong?

01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:50.247
Stomach...

01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:53.127
Me too!

01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:56.007
Quick...

01:36:57.480 --> 01:36:58.561
My Turn!

01:36:58.800 --> 01:36:59.847
Quickly...

01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:07.483
Wait!

01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:17.609
Junior Commandant!

01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:18.961
Someone wants to see you outside.

01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:20.804
He says he has a gift for you.

01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:25.160
He came to join our game.

01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:27.849
Send him up.

01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:28.409
Yes, sir!

01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:35.961
Come up!

01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:37.088
Go!

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:45.728
Junior Commandant.

01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:48.288
You changed into black clothes.

01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:56.001
Behave.

01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:03.484
Congratulations on conquering Pucheng!

01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:06.651
I bring you a valuable gift.

01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:08.770
A... a gift?

01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:09.648
Of course.

01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:12.251
You want to rescue a cooked duck?

01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:14.561
Let me see what it is'?

01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:16.121
Don't get too excited!

01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:17.082
I'll get it for you right away.

01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:19.849
Bring it.

01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:20.722
What?

01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:22.640
What I just gave you.

01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:23.482
What?

01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:24.607
Where is the thing I just gave you?

01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:25.602
What thing?

01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:33.843
Junior Commandant!

01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:50.164
I knew you didn't have a gift.

01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:51.281
It's a trick.

01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:52.891
I'm not tricking you!

01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:55.801
My gift was to release Yang Kenan for you.

01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:57.166
To help you build up some karma points.

01:38:57.600 --> 01:38:58.362
But we don't need it anymore

01:38:58.400 --> 01:38:59.561
Since you killed another person.

01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:02.600
Why do I need karma points?

01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:04.564
Don't you know why I let you up here'?

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:05.728
It's because it's...

01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:07.205
Fun!

01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:22.726
There's an explosion at the army camp!

01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:25.723
Hurry; see what's going on!

01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:45.248
Sheriff!

01:42:58.240 --> 01:42:59.401
I told you to behave!

01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:01.401
Why must you get me in trouble?

01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:03.001
When did I do that'?

01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:05.290
I came to kill the bastard.

01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:06.602
If you kill him

01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:07.847
You'll destroy me!

01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:08.722
Get it?

01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:38.247
How's this

01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:40.405
Kill the bastard for me,

01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:41.687
And I'll kill his dad for you.

01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:43.611
I guarantee you'll be made Commandant.

01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:46.288
Can you?

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:21.129
Let's go!

01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:48.245
Yi!

01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:10.609
Kenan!

01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:13.327
Go,now!

01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:04.368
Sheriff!

01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:23.362
Stop pacing.

01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:09.282
Sheriff!

01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:09.005
The heavens...

01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:10.883
choose who will die.

01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:40.289
I am Cao Ying's son.

01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:42.681
I am Cao...

01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:53.484
Cao Ying is my father!

01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:06.444
Kill him!

01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:46.884
Remember when Master punished me

01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:49.208
and forbade me food and water

01:50:49.320 --> 01:50:50.731
for three days? thankfully, you...

01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:52.842
Enough, already!

01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:55.609
I brought you an egg.

01:50:56.320 --> 01:50:57.481
You're eternally grateful.

01:50:58.280 --> 01:51:00.487
You've told me hundreds of times.

01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:03.451
Because of the egg and Master,

01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:06.162
I will always give you a 30% advantage.

01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:07.602
So when I hit you

01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:09.245
you can't hit back.

01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:14.727
Always...

01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:17.046
Times have changed.

01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:19.928
Ours was not a long-term career.

01:51:22.440 --> 01:51:24.568
There is no 'always.'

01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:17.367
Thank you.

01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:20.601
You're welcome.

01:52:22.240 --> 01:52:23.162
It's just as you said:

01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:28.283
Justice exists only when maintained.

01:53:01.080 --> 01:53:04.562
Days later, Cao's army headed to Pucheng

01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:08.491
with orders to destroy; the Southern army

01:53:08.560 --> 01:53:11.086
fought the Cao army 10 miles outside Pucheng

01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:14.761
and defeated them, killing Cao.

01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:22.282
I should go.

01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:24.884
When you come again,

01:53:24.920 --> 01:53:25.887
Remember to look me up.

01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:27.561
I will trim your beard again

01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:28.329
Free of charge.

01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:30.850
If you want to roam the country

01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:31.961
And be a wanderer,

01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:33.167
You can look me up.

01:53:35.240 --> 01:53:36.048
I do...

01:53:36.600 --> 01:53:38.204
I want to roam the country,

01:53:38.240 --> 01:53:39.321
Uphold justice,

01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:40.850
And be a heroine!

01:53:43.480 --> 01:53:46.086
We'll talk when you're grown up.

01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:49.402
My friend Ma Feng,

01:53:49.920 --> 01:53:50.728
Take care of yourself.

01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:01.047
Take care.

01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:04.322
Take care.

01:54:11.120 --> 01:54:12.201
Ma Feng!

01:54:12.560 --> 01:54:14.050
Where will you go?

01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:16.921
I don't know.

01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:18.401
You'll have to ask...

01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:20.044
Taiping, here.

01:54:30.560 --> 01:54:31.163
Taiping!
