Yeah, except it's "Vick"-o-din

-This is not what I meant by help.
-What did you mean?

01:29.631 --> 01:32.425
[stammers] I think I meant someone
who could, like, help.

01:32.509 --> 01:34.385
[Grace] Where is my phone charger?

01:34.469 --> 01:37.180
-Oh, I saw it upstairs.
-Oh, I can get it.

No, that's why I'm here.

She knew exactly where that charger was.

-Did she though?
-Oh, God.

01:55.573 --> 01:59.744
I cannot be late today.
We're working on a hotel deal that--

[clears throat]

02:03.665 --> 02:05.083
Why did you rip today out of your planner?

02:05.166 --> 02:06.709
Because you ruined it.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.586
She's a little on edge.

02:08.670 --> 02:11.923
She and Brianna have been battling
for the mountaintop at work.

02:12.006 --> 02:14.092
I'm not battling. I'm winning.

02:14.175 --> 02:15.802
And I'm winning lunch.

Today, Joan-Margaret is taking me
to Zipper Snappers.

02:18.847 --> 02:21.266
-She's taking you to a strip club?
-I wish.

02:21.349 --> 02:23.434
No, it's the hot new buffet in town

02:30.608 --> 02:34.821
There's a lady at my casino
who says it's a sexy senior meat market.

02:34.904 --> 02:38.741
And we should get there fast
before all the man-meat spoils.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.451
-Okay, girls.

Joan-Margaret,
we found the charger.

02:44.414 --> 02:46.291
Oh, for fuck's sake.

She's everywhere.

-So on top of it.
-We made a deal in good faith.

Joan-Margaret isn't
keeping our agreement.

Point of order. Protractor.

Peter, you let me worry about how perfect
my Don Quixote is going to be.

03:33.338 --> 03:36.883
Your focus should be on finding me
the perfect Sancho.

03:36.966 --> 03:39.802
Our whole company is comprised of Sanchos.

03:39.886 --> 03:43.514
Then maybe you can concentrate
on working things out with Jeff.

03:43.598 --> 03:45.350
Jeff can't play Sancho.

I...

about finding me a stellar sidekick.

Our best bets are Donald, Reggie, or Enzo,

04:00.907 --> 04:03.076
who looks the part but has no talent.

04:03.159 --> 04:04.452
[Sol] Norman has talent.

04:04.911 --> 04:07.497
Talent to be a lovely house guest.

He's quiet and he brought his own food.

-Oliver.
-Hi.

Can I talk to you?

04:31.938 --> 04:33.982
Oh, boy. [sighs]

04:34.065 --> 04:36.442
-What did I do now?
-Will there be yelling, Oliver?

04:36.526 --> 04:38.278
'Cause I need to know
if there'll be yelling.

04:38.361 --> 04:40.613
No, no. It's nothing like that, but...

04:41.030 --> 04:42.865
it is kind of a bombshell.
[sighs]

04:44.367 --> 04:45.493
I'm gay.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.747
I'm sorry, what's the bombshell?

04:50.665 --> 04:53.835
Ugh... She's here.
Are you sure this isn't too much?

04:53.918 --> 04:55.962
She wore red, she sits at my desk,

04:56.045 --> 04:58.798
and she showed the entire staff
that video of my pad falling out

04:58.881 --> 05:00.717
during my jazz-tap recital.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.553
I felt so terrible for you that day.

but it's not quite... that number.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.440
-We thought you were 76, too--
-I am.

05:57.899 --> 06:01.402
Because last year I was 75
and we didn't have a party,

06:01.486 --> 06:04.447
the way I like it,
and this is a whole year later.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.366
-It is. It is.
-Yes!

06:06.449 --> 06:09.660
And yesterday, Barry brought me
some of your start-up paperwork

06:09.744 --> 06:12.121
and I noticed a few discrepancies.

06:12.955 --> 06:14.665
-So, I did a little diggin'.
-Actually, I did.

06:14.749 --> 06:17.543

06:27.970 --> 06:29.305
Barry, you're an accountant,

06:29.931 --> 06:33.434
so if she was born on this date,
how old does that make her now?

06:33.518 --> 06:34.936
I'm not really good at minus-ing.

06:35.019 --> 06:39.023
Guess what, everybody.
I found another video of Brianna.

06:39.107 --> 06:41.901

if that's the trampoline video...

Alright now, plan of attack.

06:56.541 --> 07:00.503
First, we hit the rib station,
fill both of our plates with ribs.

07:00.586 --> 07:02.588
-All the ribs.
-But I don't eat ribs.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.382
Neither do I. They're bait.

07:04.465 --> 07:06.217
Men want ribs.

07:06.300 --> 07:07.927
We're the ladies with the ribs.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.783
That seemed quick, didn't it?

07:30.867 --> 07:34.704
Not for the oldest laser tag player
in San Diego.

07:36.205 --> 07:37.415
We'll get this.

07:38.249 --> 07:39.375
[dog barks]

07:40.751 --> 07:42.170
Once you finally come out,

07:42.253 --> 07:45.423
it's like your whole life
just kind of... blows up.

07:45.506 --> 07:47.425
We'll try to remember that.

07:49.010 --> 07:52.013
But you're glad you'd someone
who cared enough to give you that push.

07:52.096 --> 07:54.432
It was more like a shove, but, yeah.

07:54.515 --> 07:56.267
But you're glad you had that someone.

07:56.350 --> 07:58.227
He's glad. He's glad.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.772
So, Oliver, how did Jo take the news?

08:01.856 --> 08:04.192
Already moved on with
a hot friend of ours. [chuckles]

08:04.275 --> 08:06.986

he's had a crush on me for years.

-I guess she's got a type.
-Yeah. [chuckles]

08:09.822 --> 08:12.408

most of our friends which is fine.

"hello again" to me.

Am I still talking?

10:46.187 --> 10:49.398
So, unless you have
anything else for us...

10:49.482 --> 10:51.859
-Aren't we gonna talk about packaging?
-We have.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.403
-Would you like to catch her up?
-Yes.

10:54.487 --> 10:57.239
So, the hotel wants to manage packaging

10:57.323 --> 11:00.409
and they prefer having
their names on the products.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.620
Then I think we have to take
another look at that.

11:02.703 --> 11:04.914
No. We're all set.

11:05.623 --> 11:08.584
And plus, it's really about the products,
which are eco-conscious--

11:08.668 --> 11:11.295
They are? Oh, Ron loves eco-conscious.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.005
It's huge with our demo.

11:13.089 --> 11:14.924
Which is why I mentioned it,

11:15.007 --> 11:18.594
just a few moments ago
in this very uncomfortable chair.

11:19.428 --> 11:20.930
I'm sorry, did you want this chair?

11:21.013 --> 11:24.392
-[stammers] Or a pillow?
-You guys, she said she's fine.

11:25.976 --> 11:26.852
[sighs]

11:26.936 --> 11:29.230
Not to be a bother,
but I wouldn't mind a pillow.

11:32.650 --> 11:33.484
Thank you.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.027
Back thing.

11:41.325 --> 11:43.244
I'll handle this bruiser.

11:43.661 --> 11:47.123
Hey, watch out, I'm coming through.
Watch out, hot stuff. Move it.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.208
Are you Fritz?

11:49.291 --> 11:50.751
It's "Fitz."

11:50.835 --> 11:52.253
Of course it is.

11:52.336 --> 11:54.880
We were told you're the guy
who can add some time

11:54.964 --> 11:57.925
to a crosswalk light at 2nd and Franklin.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.677
Or is it "Fanklin"?

11:59.760 --> 12:00.803
I'm the guy.

12:00.886 --> 12:01.971
Hello.

12:03.139 --> 12:04.140
Hi.

12:04.890 --> 12:07.435
-What are either of your names?
-We'll get to that.

12:07.518 --> 12:11.647
You think we don't see the clock ticking
in our heads every day?

12:11.731 --> 12:16.193
We don't need some crosswalk
reminding us how little time we have left.

12:16.277 --> 12:18.070
What are you going to do about it?

12:19.071 --> 12:20.406
Address it right away.

12:20.489 --> 12:22.908
Any complaint about a crosswalk
triggers an automatic audit.

12:22.992 --> 12:24.326
Address it right away,

12:24.410 --> 12:28.914
like, what, wrap it in red tape
and shove it in a pneumatic tube to hell?

12:29.290 --> 12:31.500
Frankie, I can't get audited.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.378
I just took over
an underground bingo game.

12:34.462 --> 12:36.589
An audit, in this case,

12:36.672 --> 12:39.925
is a pedestrian traffic test to see
if the timing of the light is correct.

12:40.384 --> 12:41.969
I can schedule one for...

12:43.053 --> 12:44.054
tomorrow.

12:44.722 --> 12:46.932
Tomorrow of what year?

12:47.016 --> 12:48.100
This year.

12:48.184 --> 12:50.853
Yeah, but... what day?

12:51.353 --> 12:52.980
Day after today,

12:53.063 --> 12:54.857
as in tomorrow...

12:55.858 --> 12:57.693
November tenth, 10:00 a.m.

12:58.652 --> 12:59.779
Oh.

13:01.197 --> 13:02.281
Okay.

13:03.199 --> 13:05.868
Thank you... Fitz.

13:08.871 --> 13:11.624
Wait! Today's the ninth?!

13:12.875 --> 13:16.337
What happened just now at that meeting
wasn't just humiliating,

13:16.420 --> 13:18.130
it was bad for business.

13:18.547 --> 13:20.382
Excuse me for celebrating you.

13:20.466 --> 13:24.220
Oh, is that what you were doing,
celebrating? [chuckles]

13:24.303 --> 13:27.056
How about I throw
a big party for your IBS?

13:27.139 --> 13:28.057
Okay.

13:29.183 --> 13:32.478
All I was trying to do
was to get you to hear me.

13:32.561 --> 13:36.816
Well, now that you've told everybody
how old I am, nobody hears me.

13:36.899 --> 13:39.610
Mom, I need to get this company
back on track.

13:39.693 --> 13:41.487
-And I'm stopping you?
-Yes.

13:41.570 --> 13:43.989
Because you say and do
whatever you want around here,

13:44.073 --> 13:45.783
which is not what we agreed to.

13:45.866 --> 13:48.160
And I am sorry about today,

13:48.244 --> 13:51.163
but the only way
that I could stop a steamroller

13:51.247 --> 13:53.415
was to ride in on another steamroller.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.543
You know what?
You think you know everything?

13:55.626 --> 13:58.087
You can handle
that meeting tomorrow on your own.

13:59.004 --> 14:00.506
Mom, please.

14:00.589 --> 14:01.465
No.

14:01.549 --> 14:04.552
You don't want my help,
you don't get my help.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.435
Happy birthday.

14:19.441 --> 14:21.360
-Happy 76th!
-Oh, my God!

14:22.528 --> 14:24.113
I forgot, but then I remembered,

14:24.196 --> 14:27.992
and how great is it I got this 76ers stuff
I bought at that garage sale

14:28.075 --> 14:29.743
you yelled at me about going to.

14:29.827 --> 14:32.371
I need vodka... now.

14:33.372 --> 14:35.165
I have news.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.376
Happy birthday
76

14:39.670 --> 14:41.714
Eighty?! You're eighty?!

14:41.797 --> 14:43.632
Stop saying that number.

14:44.341 --> 14:47.261
You are 23 years older than me?

14:48.804 --> 14:50.055
Learn math.

14:50.514 --> 14:54.768
-How have you been lying so long?
-People do it all the time.

14:55.561 --> 14:58.022
Only most of them don't have
a daughter from hell,

14:58.105 --> 14:59.899
so the chickens never come home to roost.

15:01.233 --> 15:04.153
Don't fixate on chickens now.

15:04.236 --> 15:05.362
I'll try.

15:06.071 --> 15:10.576
I just want to say, I do think it
bodes well for you getting to a hundred.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.745
A hundred chickens...

15:12.828 --> 15:14.163
-Frankie.
-Sorry.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.123
When did you start this?

15:16.206 --> 15:19.001
Oh, way back, pre-Robert.

15:19.543 --> 15:21.795
But in those days,
if you hadn't landed a husband

15:21.879 --> 15:24.715
and had kids before 30,
people thought you were an old maid.

15:24.798 --> 15:25.841
Or a lesbian.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.801
So I trimmed a few years.

15:27.885 --> 15:29.470
And back then, you could get away with it.

15:29.553 --> 15:32.139
You know, in the glory days
before Google and Facebook.

15:32.222 --> 15:34.767
Oh, but Facebook birthdays are the shit.

15:34.850 --> 15:38.354
You know you can send someone
fireworks and confetti now?

15:38.437 --> 15:42.358
I mean, it's animated,
but it's still very powerful.

15:42.441 --> 15:44.193
Please don't do that for me.

15:44.818 --> 15:47.279
I don't want the world to know
I'm as old as I am.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.907
Why? Eighty is amazing!

15:49.990 --> 15:53.035
If you were a tortoise,
you'd still be a teenager.

15:53.118 --> 15:55.621
Yeah, but if you're a person
at that number...

15:56.080 --> 15:58.958
everybody looks at you
like you have no future.

15:59.041 --> 16:02.878
Well, they just write you off,
or they want you to act your age.

16:02.962 --> 16:06.173
And when you do act your age,
they run out of snow crabs.

16:07.174 --> 16:08.008
What?

16:08.092 --> 16:11.512
That's why I marched
into city hall today with Joan-Margaret.

16:11.595 --> 16:15.557
You can't march into City Hall
every time a buffet runs out of food.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.434
We couldn't even get to the buffet.

16:17.518 --> 16:20.562
That's why we're going to get
that crosswalk light changed,

16:20.646 --> 16:23.315
to give more time to people like me

16:23.399 --> 16:24.942
and older folks, like you.

16:25.025 --> 16:27.236
-And you!
-That's my point.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.321
We can't be ruled by numbers.

16:29.863 --> 16:34.451
Not the ones people set for us
or the ones that we made up for ourselves.

16:34.535 --> 16:38.914
Our job is to say "fuck it"
to those numbers... and eat cake.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.876
Frankie, you can't have your cake
and "fuck it," too.

16:44.878 --> 16:47.381
-Can I "fuck it" and then eat it?

22:10.704 --> 22:11.997
I got your text.

22:13.081 --> 22:15.417
[mouthing] Slow.

22:16.668 --> 22:19.046
[walk signal beeping]

22:19.129 --> 22:20.797
Slow.

22:21.798 --> 22:24.593
Oh.

22:24.676 --> 22:28.096
Oh, God, he's doing so good.
Oh God, he's doing it. He's doing it.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.931
[walk signal]<i> Wait. Wait. Wait.</i>

22:30.015 --> 22:32.100
Oh, no.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.728
[barking]

22:34.811 --> 22:37.022
Oh, no! No! Oh, my God!

22:37.105 --> 22:38.023
Agh.

22:38.106 --> 22:41.568
When is this guy gonna stop boning me?
[gasps]

22:41.651 --> 22:43.695
So, if everything looks in order, Ron,

22:43.779 --> 22:45.906
I can broadly highlight the deal points.
Great.

22:47.157 --> 22:49.242
Grace. Everything okay?

22:49.326 --> 22:52.662
If you mean, did I get here
in one piece despite my advanced years?

22:52.746 --> 22:55.207
All good. Just here for support.

22:55.791 --> 22:57.084
-Hello.
-Hello.

22:57.167 --> 22:58.001
Hi.

23:01.296 --> 23:02.839
-Okey-dokey.
-[Grace] Mm-hmm.

23:03.507 --> 23:05.509
So, our terms are
for a five-year contract,

23:05.592 --> 23:07.636
the hotel will manage the packaging,

23:07.719 --> 23:09.763
and there'll be
no Say Grace branding on the product.

23:09.846 --> 23:11.014
Yes, very good.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.102
Grace, does it sound okay to you?

23:16.436 --> 23:18.021
Would you excuse us a moment, Ron?

23:22.359 --> 23:23.360
Yes?

23:24.361 --> 23:27.614
I see a play here.
You mind if I try something?

23:29.408 --> 23:30.617
Yes, fine. Take your shot.

23:30.700 --> 23:32.661
But we cannot blow this deal.

23:32.744 --> 23:33.745
Right.

23:36.832 --> 23:40.335
I saw that your packaging contract
is with Becker and Sons.

23:40.419 --> 23:43.171
Yes, we started using them
a few years ago.

23:43.255 --> 23:44.214
Very happy with them.

23:44.297 --> 23:46.299
Tommy Becker is the best.

23:46.758 --> 23:49.386
I've known Tommy and worked with him...
[clicks tongue]

23:49.469 --> 23:53.348
-Well, let's just say, going way back.
-Hmm.

23:53.432 --> 23:56.560
And he has given me the same deal
since we started out.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.479
Thirty percent lower than his normal fee.

24:00.230 --> 24:01.106
Thirty percent?

24:02.149 --> 24:04.651
Yes, and you have
a lot of packaging, don't you?

24:04.734 --> 24:05.944
Could you get that for us?

24:06.027 --> 24:08.613
Well, actually,
I called Tommy on the way here.

24:09.197 --> 24:10.907
He'd be happy to honor it.

24:11.908 --> 24:13.577
It's "grandmothered" in.

24:14.828 --> 24:16.037
-That would be wonderful.
-Yeah.

24:16.121 --> 24:18.373
However, for the 30 percent,

24:19.082 --> 24:21.042
we're going to need our name
on those products.

24:21.126 --> 24:23.753
-Oh, no.
-Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom.

24:24.629 --> 24:27.424
Please, this is about
the future of the company.

24:27.507 --> 24:30.302
Without our name,
the company has no future.

24:37.642 --> 24:40.604
Ron, does anyone enjoy thinking
their hotel made their shampoo?

24:41.897 --> 24:43.106
Interesting point.

24:44.065 --> 24:47.277
Grace is right.
We need our name or there's no deal.

24:48.236 --> 24:49.237
[groans]

24:53.450 --> 24:55.285
Thirty percent off...
[inhales]

24:58.497 --> 25:00.749
It's worth the name. We have a deal.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.418
You will not regret it.

25:04.169 --> 25:05.003
[whispers] Thank you.

25:05.086 --> 25:06.838
Oh, sorry, old ears.

25:06.922 --> 25:08.673
Could you say that a little louder?

25:08.757 --> 25:10.133
Thank you.

25:11.426 --> 25:12.469
You're welcome.

25:14.095 --> 25:17.265
I hate to make a fast exit,
but there's a place I have to be.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.684
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

25:22.771 --> 25:24.814
And Oliver can tap dance, too.

25:24.898 --> 25:27.609
Now, most Sanchos don't tap,
but the donkey does,

25:27.692 --> 25:29.569
so maybe there's something
we can work out.

25:30.487 --> 25:32.864
Okay, I'm out of here.

25:33.740 --> 25:34.991
What? You're leaving?

25:35.075 --> 25:38.578
So soon? I thought you and Jeff
had big problems.

25:38.662 --> 25:41.665
I let Jeff sleep with Stevie Mazza.

25:41.748 --> 25:42.707
We're all good.

25:43.583 --> 25:44.918
Come on, Norman.

25:50.006 --> 25:51.383
Wait.

25:51.466 --> 25:52.676
I need a moment.

25:56.638 --> 25:59.933
You know, you always have a place here.

26:00.684 --> 26:01.935
Here.

26:03.019 --> 26:04.020
And here.

26:04.104 --> 26:05.146
Oh, Jesus.

26:05.230 --> 26:07.774
Robert, I have some big news.

26:07.857 --> 26:09.901
I found the perfect Sancho.

26:09.985 --> 26:11.945
Oh, I know. I was just telling Sol.

26:12.028 --> 26:13.321
It's you!

26:15.365 --> 26:16.199
It's what?

26:16.283 --> 26:19.411
Oliver will play Don Quixote
and you will be Sancho.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.872
I sure have to go now. Bye.
Thanks for everything.

26:23.915 --> 26:25.625
[Peter] Say goodbye, Norman.

26:26.543 --> 26:27.502
[door closes]

26:29.796 --> 26:32.632
Sweetheart, I am so sorry.

26:41.850 --> 26:42.976
I'm Sancho?

26:43.518 --> 26:44.477
You're Sancho.

26:46.563 --> 26:48.898
But you have to believe me when I say...

26:50.817 --> 26:52.235
we need a dog.

26:53.945 --> 26:54.863
What?

26:57.282 --> 26:58.700
Three minutes left, ma'am.

26:58.783 --> 27:01.453
I'm sorry, I'm not gonna be able
to extend this light time.

27:01.536 --> 27:03.663
Fitz, please,
get your head out of the numbers

27:03.747 --> 27:05.457
and see how unfair this--

27:07.250 --> 27:08.418
Grace!

27:10.920 --> 27:12.380
How's it going?

27:13.757 --> 27:14.758
Oh.

27:14.841 --> 27:16.760
We need you to cross.

27:17.510 --> 27:19.387
But please, Grace...

27:19.971 --> 27:22.390
act your age.
