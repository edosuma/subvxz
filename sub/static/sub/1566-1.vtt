00:46.959 --> 00:52.715
- The coffin has your initials: JB.
- At this moment, rather him than me.

00:54.008 --> 00:57.011
At least you've been saved
the effort of removing him.

00:57.094 --> 01:00.514
Colonel Bouvar passed away in his sleep.

01:02.266 --> 01:05.603
You sound disappointed
you did not kill him yourself.

01:05.686 --> 01:10.566
I am. Jacques Bouvar murdered
two of my colleagues.

01:17.031 --> 01:21.827
Is there anything else our French station
can do for Monsieur Bond?

01:21.911 --> 01:23.579
Later, perhaps.

01:34.423 --> 01:37.093
As I said, later. Come on.

02:18.843 --> 02:20.553
Madame.

02:20.636 --> 02:24.140
I've come to offer
my sincere condolences.

02:26.308 --> 02:30.771
My dear Colonel Bouvar, you shouldn't
have opened that car door by yourself.

03:29.455 --> 03:31.791
<i>Ouvrez! Ouvrez!</i>

03:47.473 --> 03:49.975
<i>Viens! Il est là!</i>

04:15.626 --> 04:19.839
- No man should be without one.
- Yes, very practical.

04:19.922 --> 04:22.007
Get inside.

04:23.217 --> 04:25.469
Hurry!

07:52.760 --> 07:55.096
No parking here.

07:56.138 --> 07:58.599
Pardon, Monsieur Largo.

08:07.191 --> 08:11.987
The Brotherhood for Assistance of
Stateless Persons is purely philanthropic.

08:12.071 --> 08:15.533
We're only interested
in your rehabilitation.

08:15.616 --> 08:21.831
We have arranged for visas with the
Brazilian Consulate. The brotherhood...

08:21.914 --> 08:24.333
- Good morning, Mr Largo.
- Good morning.

08:24.417 --> 08:26.627
- Nice to have you back again.
- Thank you.

08:26.711 --> 08:29.255
- We pay back everything.
- No need.

08:29.338 --> 08:33.884
We have certain funds from
private individuals who share our aim.

08:33.967 --> 08:37.096
There are just one or two formalities...

08:54.989 --> 09:01.620
Sit down, Number Two.
We will discuss your NATO project later.

09:01.704 --> 09:05.875
I regret to inform you all
of the death of SPECTRE Number Six.

09:05.958 --> 09:09.503
Colonel Jacques Bouvar
was killed by an unknown assassin.

09:09.587 --> 09:12.590
His services will be greatly missed.

09:12.673 --> 09:16.844
We will now proceed with the
area financial reports. Number Seven?

09:18.262 --> 09:22.224
Blackmail of the double agent
Matsou Fujiwa.

09:22.308 --> 09:26.062
Unfortunately, only 40 million yen.

09:26.145 --> 09:28.272
- All the man had.
- Number Ten?

09:28.355 --> 09:33.569
Assassination of Perringe, the anti-matter
specialist who went over to the Russians.

09:33.652 --> 09:37.156
Three million francs
from the Quai d'Orsay.

09:37.239 --> 09:38.449
Number Five.

09:38.532 --> 09:43.120
Our consultation fee
for the British train robbery: £250,000.

09:44.622 --> 09:46.499
Number Eleven.

09:46.582 --> 09:52.797
Distribution of Red China narcotics
in the United States: $2,300,000.

09:52.880 --> 09:57.009
- Collected by Number Nine and myself.
- Two million, three?

09:57.093 --> 10:01.472
Our expectations
were considerably higher, Number Eleven.

10:01.555 --> 10:05.017
Competition from Latin America.
Prices are down.

10:05.101 --> 10:07.728
I anticipated that factor.

10:07.812 --> 10:10.898
Are you sure all monies
have been accounted for

10:10.981 --> 10:13.401
by yourself and Number Nine?

10:13.484 --> 10:17.113
- To the penny, Number One.
- On the contrary.

10:17.196 --> 10:22.076
I have satisfied myself that one of you
is clearly guilty of embezzlement.

10:22.159 --> 10:28.416
SPECTRE is a fraternity whose strength
lies in the absolute integrity of members.

10:28.499 --> 10:33.337
The culprit is known to me.
I have decided on the appropriate action.

10:54.275 --> 10:57.153
Let us now proceed with new business.

10:57.236 --> 11:01.282
We will hear from Number Two,
who is in charge of our NATO project,

11:01.365 --> 11:04.118
the most ambitious
SPECTRE has ever undertaken.

11:04.201 --> 11:06.245
Your report, Number Two.

11:06.871 --> 11:08.622
Thank you, Number One.

11:08.706 --> 11:13.669
Our intention is to demand a ransom
from the North Atlantic Treaty powers

11:13.753 --> 11:18.340
of $280 million, £100 million.

11:19.175 --> 11:23.304
I have sent SPECTRE agent Count Lippe
to the South of England,

11:23.387 --> 11:26.640
where he is making
the necessary preparations.

11:26.724 --> 11:32.480
He is at a health clinic conveniently
located near the NATO air base.

11:33.522 --> 11:36.484
Pat?
I'll see you when I've had a shower.

11:36.567 --> 11:39.403
I'll soon be finished.
Mr Bond, Count Lippe.

11:39.487 --> 11:44.575
You're not taking her away already?
She's the only joy in this dreary place.

11:44.658 --> 11:48.162
I see you've discovered that, too.

11:48.245 --> 11:50.581
- In about half an hour, Pat.
- I'll be ready.

11:50.664 --> 11:52.958
I've heard that before.

11:53.042 --> 11:55.628
Nice to have met you, Mr Bond.

11:57.630 --> 12:00.424
Funny-looking bruise. A fall?

12:00.508 --> 12:03.886
A poker, in the hands of a widow.

12:03.969 --> 12:07.973
I'm surprised. I'd have thought
you were just the type for a widow.

12:08.057 --> 12:11.477
Not this one.
He didn't like me at all.

12:13.396 --> 12:17.108
- A red square with a spike through it.
- Yes, I think it's a tong sign.

12:17.191 --> 12:20.444
The Red Dragon from Macao.
Ask Records to verify it.

12:20.528 --> 12:24.365
Sorry, sweetie. You're off duty.
File it till you get back.

12:24.448 --> 12:27.743
Moneypenny, next time I see you
I'll put you across my knee.

12:27.827 --> 12:32.707
On yoghurt and lemon juice?
I can hardly wait.

12:32.790 --> 12:37.336
- Come on, Pat. We're behind schedule.
- Coming.

12:37.420 --> 12:40.673
I can't hear you, James.
Have you fainted?

14:13.682 --> 14:16.394
You're late, Mr Bond.

14:17.436 --> 14:18.854
Me?

14:18.938 --> 14:21.565
Well, I'd never have recognised myself.

14:21.649 --> 14:25.403
- Do I seem healthy?
- Too healthy by far.

14:25.486 --> 14:28.489
Take off your bathrobe, please.

14:28.572 --> 14:33.077
- You never say that as if you meant it.
- Arms above your head, please.

14:46.298 --> 14:49.260
Behave yourself, Mr Bond.

14:49.343 --> 14:53.806
I can see there's only one place
to keep you quiet.

14:53.889 --> 14:58.477
- And what's this?
- A traction table for stretching the spine.

14:58.561 --> 15:01.897
- Some patients call it "the rack".
- I'm not surprised.

15:01.981 --> 15:04.066
Get on.

15:05.443 --> 15:11.449
- Where's the kick-starter?
- Stop fooling around. Face down, please.

15:11.532 --> 15:15.411
By the way, who is the man
in the room next to your Count Lippe?

15:15.494 --> 15:18.956
I really don't know too much about him.
A Mr Angelo.

15:19.040 --> 15:23.878
He's here with a private physician,
recuperating from an awful car crash.

15:25.171 --> 15:29.383
There now. First time
I've felt really safe all day.

15:31.844 --> 15:34.638
I'll look in and see how you're doing
in 15 minutes.

15:55.493 --> 15:58.746
Nice to have met you, Mr Bond.

16:01.999 --> 16:03.918
Come back.

16:11.008 --> 16:14.011
Help. Help.

16:25.272 --> 16:27.650
Mr Bond. Mr Bond.

16:27.733 --> 16:29.318
Thank God.

16:29.402 --> 16:32.446
Thank God. You could have been killed.

16:33.697 --> 16:36.283
I must be six inches taller.

16:36.367 --> 16:40.705
You poor dear.
I can't think how it could have happened.

16:40.788 --> 16:44.834
I can tell you,
it's a miracle I came back when I did.

16:44.917 --> 16:48.587
I can only think that you must have
pushed the switch accidentally.

16:48.671 --> 16:50.631
You'd better come with me.

16:50.715 --> 16:55.177
Spend a few minutes in the steam room.
It'll help to relax you.

16:55.261 --> 16:57.930
- Yes...
- It might even shrink you back to size.

16:58.013 --> 17:01.142
Somebody's going to wish
today had never happened.

17:01.225 --> 17:05.563
You wouldn't tell Dr Wain?
Please. I'd lose my job.

17:06.564 --> 17:10.233
Well, I suppose
my silence could have a price.

17:10.317 --> 17:12.486
You don't mean...?

17:12.569 --> 17:15.071
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

17:25.290 --> 17:27.877
See you later, alligator.

17:59.825 --> 18:03.204
- What are you doing?
- Don't worry. I'll tell the chef.

18:03.287 --> 18:06.791
Let me out of this bloody machine. Help.

18:06.874 --> 18:09.085
Help.

18:18.886 --> 18:20.679
Mink.

18:20.763 --> 18:24.183
It reduces the tensions.

18:25.101 --> 18:27.353
Not mine.

18:40.950 --> 18:44.954
- Major Derval's social secretary.
- I would like to speak to Mr Angelo.

18:45.037 --> 18:47.039
- What's that?
- Mr Angelo.

18:47.123 --> 18:50.501
I'm sorry. You got the wrong number.

18:50.584 --> 18:53.963
You'd be more comfortable
if you took off...

18:55.756 --> 18:57.383
- Yes?
- Major Derval?

18:57.466 --> 18:59.552
- Yes.
- Your car is waiting.

18:59.635 --> 19:03.514
I'll be down right away. Thank you.

19:03.597 --> 19:06.267
My car's here. Duty calls.
The story of my life.

19:06.350 --> 19:11.272
You'll be late at the air base.
Besides, it will give you time to cool off.

19:11.355 --> 19:13.649
You'll be here when I come back?

19:15.651 --> 19:19.113
But I may not be in the mood then.

19:19.196 --> 19:22.575
- Do you want to bet?
- You know your François, hm?

19:22.658 --> 19:25.619
- I know me.
- All right, all right.

19:25.703 --> 19:29.665
- I told him I'd be down.
- Your coat, sir?

19:30.833 --> 19:34.628
- Happy landing.
- Thank you.

19:34.712 --> 19:37.423
Be good, at least until I get back.

19:39.300 --> 19:41.385
<i>Ciao.</i>

19:51.353 --> 19:55.608
- Nobody saw us. The corridor is empty.
- Shut that door.

19:59.403 --> 20:03.407
He's dead. Lippe, take over.
Are the doctor and ambulance outside?

20:03.491 --> 20:06.410
- Everything, as arranged.
- Angelo.

20:07.453 --> 20:09.663
Your breathing equipment.

20:09.747 --> 20:13.376
Isolates you from the oxygen supply.

20:13.459 --> 20:16.837
Gamma gas. Instantaneous.
Type you just used.

20:16.921 --> 20:20.174
And most important...

20:23.761 --> 20:27.348
Not enough.
$100,000 is not enough.

20:27.431 --> 20:30.559
- What are you trying to say?
- I changed my mind.

20:30.643 --> 20:34.730
Two years of my life,
studying the film, the reports,

20:34.814 --> 20:39.110
plastic operations, voice lessons.

20:39.193 --> 20:42.571
Make it a quarter of a million
or get someone else.

20:42.655 --> 20:46.909
- There is no-one else.
- Exactly. I am Derval.

20:53.999 --> 20:57.044
Put that away.
Angelo is right.

20:57.128 --> 20:59.839
I'll inform Number One
we made a new arrangement.

20:59.922 --> 21:02.758
This is merely a down payment.

21:02.842 --> 21:05.428
All right, but against quarter of a million.

21:05.511 --> 21:07.430
Agreed.

21:07.513 --> 21:10.099
His watch. Identification disc.

21:13.936 --> 21:17.815
- <i>Au revoir.</i>
- No, no. He always says <i>ciao.</i>

21:17.898 --> 21:21.944
- <i>Ciao.</i>
- And the cap is too far back on your head.

21:24.405 --> 21:27.074
The rest of my money, just have it ready.

21:30.870 --> 21:33.998
Come on. Get him into his pyjamas.

21:47.553 --> 21:50.389
Sir. Identity, please, sir.

21:56.812 --> 21:58.481
Thank you, sir.

21:59.732 --> 22:01.817
This is a normal training sortie.

22:01.901 --> 22:06.072
You'll be accompanied by a NATO
representative, Commandant Derval.

22:06.238 --> 22:08.407
Major Derval of NATO.

22:08.491 --> 22:13.245
It's a routine flight.
You'll be flying a Vulcan at 45,000 feet,

22:13.329 --> 22:16.749
armed with two atomic bombs, MOS type.

22:16.832 --> 22:20.294
Fuses as usual in the white security box.

22:47.905 --> 22:50.825
Those damned aeroplanes.

22:50.908 --> 22:54.245
They're enough to drive you mad.

22:56.038 --> 23:01.293
Unless, of course,
it's that mink glove of yours.

23:01.377 --> 23:04.380
I'll shut out the noise.

23:26.694 --> 23:30.197
James? James, where are you going?

23:30.281 --> 23:35.077
Nowhere.
I thought I'd take a little exercise.

23:35.161 --> 23:37.246
You must be joking.

23:38.664 --> 23:40.750
Come on.

23:43.961 --> 23:46.213
Quiet.

25:46.792 --> 25:49.712
Windsor Police. Can I help you?

25:49.795 --> 25:51.881
County Police here. Hello? Hello?

25:58.429 --> 26:02.975
- What's happening? What's going on?
- Could it be the front door bell?

26:03.059 --> 26:06.437
- No, it most certainly could not.
- Hello.

26:06.520 --> 26:10.399
Haven't you had enough exercise
for one evening?

26:10.483 --> 26:13.027
It's funny you should say that.

26:17.448 --> 26:22.661
Point of return:
45 minutes, 30 seconds.

26:23.329 --> 26:27.708
- Switch from manual to auto.
- Right. Set on automatic.

26:27.792 --> 26:32.713
Commandant? Like to change places
with the co-pilot? Better view up here.

26:32.797 --> 26:35.007
I'd be delighted to.

27:03.327 --> 27:07.331
RAFJET Kilo Kilo Tango 56.

27:07.415 --> 27:13.379
This is Southern Radar.
You are now under positive radar control.

27:13.462 --> 27:19.343
This is avoiding action.
Turn onto a heading of 0.92 degrees...

28:13.355 --> 28:15.608
Request you report your position.

28:19.570 --> 28:22.323
RAFJET Mike Bravo X-ray.

28:22.406 --> 28:29.038
Request you report your position.
This is the bomber controller to RAFJET.

28:29.121 --> 28:31.957
Mike Bravo X-ray 79.

28:32.041 --> 28:33.751
Over.

28:36.170 --> 28:40.007
Report your position.
Report your position.

28:51.018 --> 28:52.269
Take this.

28:52.353 --> 28:56.190
- What's the flap, Dawson?
- OBNR, sir. NATO training flight.

28:56.273 --> 28:59.860
Air traffic lost it on radar
and we can't pick it up.

28:59.944 --> 29:02.613
- Was she losing altitude?
- Yes, rapidly.

29:02.697 --> 29:05.825
We can't scan below 300 feet.
She may have gone down.

29:05.908 --> 29:09.870
- Was she in trouble?
- Not according to the last report.

29:09.954 --> 29:13.290
- She is armed, isn't she?
- Two atomic weapons, sir. MOS type.

29:13.374 --> 29:15.918
Do a thorough search.

29:16.001 --> 29:21.549
Notify the Admiralty at once - top priority.
Ask them to contact Washington.

29:49.577 --> 29:53.164
- Is there anything else in sight?
- No, all clear.

29:53.247 --> 29:56.625
Switch on the underwater landing lights.

31:14.620 --> 31:18.624
- Open the underwater hatch.
- Open underwater hatch.

35:39.009 --> 35:43.431
- Stand by to winch in the submarine!
- Man the winches!

35:47.935 --> 35:50.980
- Give these bomb fuses to Mr Kutze.
- Right, sir.

35:53.858 --> 35:57.319
Get the submarine up quickly,
and the bombs loaded.

35:57.403 --> 36:00.489
And you, Kutze.
Are you pleased with your new toys?

36:00.573 --> 36:03.117
Some new safety device.
A secret control.

36:03.200 --> 36:06.787
What can they have that
the great Ladislav Kutze cannot handle?

36:06.871 --> 36:09.915
Life was much simpler
in my Warsaw laboratory.

36:09.999 --> 36:13.461
Your share will amount to
how many Nobel prizes?

36:13.544 --> 36:15.629
Bomb forward.

36:16.464 --> 36:19.633
More, more, more. Hold it.

36:42.865 --> 36:46.619
Paris, sir.
Number One on the scrambler.

36:48.204 --> 36:51.374
Number Two speaking.
Phase two completed.

36:52.041 --> 36:56.045
Number Two has done well,
unlike Count Lippe,

36:56.128 --> 37:00.674
whose choice of Angelo might have
jeopardised the success of our project.

37:00.758 --> 37:03.177
Send a message to the Execution Branch.

37:03.511 --> 37:06.097
You will write, or telephone?

37:06.180 --> 37:11.060
Day by day. I'm sorry to dash off.
There's been a bit of a flap at the office.

37:11.143 --> 37:14.021
- What kind of work do you do, anyway?
- I travel.

37:14.105 --> 37:17.400
A sort of a licensed trouble-shooter.

37:18.609 --> 37:21.487
Mr Angelo.
Heart attack last night.

37:21.570 --> 37:23.447
I'm not surprised.

37:24.865 --> 37:28.244
- Keep in touch.
- Any time, James. Any place.

37:28.327 --> 37:31.455
Another time, another place.

38:53.120 --> 38:55.122
You are late.

38:55.206 --> 38:57.666
Some people on the roads
really burn you up.

38:57.750 --> 39:02.421
In the conference room. Something big.
Every 00 man in Europe's been rushed in.

39:02.505 --> 39:07.301
- And the home secretary, too.
- His wife's probably lost her dog.

39:22.233 --> 39:24.610
Well, now that we're all here...

39:29.073 --> 39:35.413
The prime minister has asked the home
secretary to represent him here today.

39:35.496 --> 39:37.581
The home secretary.

39:37.665 --> 39:43.963
Gentlemen, the tape you are about to hear
was received at 10 Downing Street today.

39:44.880 --> 39:47.133
My dear Prime Minister.

39:47.216 --> 39:51.470
Two atomic bombs,
numbers 456 and 457,

39:51.554 --> 39:57.643
which were aboard NATO flight 759,
are now in the possession of SPECTRE.

39:57.727 --> 40:01.814
Unless within the next seven days
your government pays to us

40:01.897 --> 40:08.112
£100 million sterling,
in a manner to be designated by us,

40:08.195 --> 40:13.701
we shall destroy a major city in England
or the United States of America.

40:13.784 --> 40:16.996
Please signal your acceptance
of our terms by arranging

40:17.079 --> 40:23.252
for Big Ben to strike
seven times at 6pm tomorrow.

40:24.879 --> 40:29.258
The prime minister and the president
have talked together over the hotline

40:29.341 --> 40:34.680
and have agreed that,
unless the bombs are recovered,

40:34.764 --> 40:36.849
payment will have to be made.

40:36.932 --> 40:40.978
To avoid general panic,
complete secrecy will be maintained,

40:41.062 --> 40:43.147
and no press announcements.

40:43.230 --> 40:47.318
The prime minister asks that your
department take charge of the operation.

40:47.401 --> 40:49.570
Thank you, sir. Sir John.

41:06.003 --> 41:09.632
This circle represents
the full flying range of the Vulcan.

41:09.715 --> 41:13.844
Extensive search has failed to locate
any evidence of a crash or landing.

41:13.928 --> 41:18.849
Worldwide reports proved negative on all
airfields big enough to handle the Vulcan.

41:18.933 --> 41:21.852
- That's all we have, sir.
- Thank you, Sir John.

41:21.936 --> 41:24.563
Well, I'll leave you to carry on.

41:24.647 --> 41:29.026
- We'll keep you in touch from Number 10.
- Thank you, sir.

41:30.069 --> 41:33.239
You may now open
the folders in front of you.

41:41.622 --> 41:44.208
Code name: Thunderball.

41:47.044 --> 41:49.588
As you can see, we've very little to go on.

41:49.672 --> 41:53.634
All the members of the crew
had top security clearance.

41:53.718 --> 41:57.346
You'll find their photographs
and service records in your files.

41:57.430 --> 42:02.810
You'll be working with NATO, CIA,
and all allied intelligence units.

42:02.893 --> 42:08.149
That's all, until you discuss
your individual assignments with me.

42:08.941 --> 42:14.905
I've assigned you to Station C, Canada.
Captain Pritchard will be your liaison.

42:14.989 --> 42:18.200
Sir, I respectfully suggest
that you assign me to Nassau.

42:18.284 --> 42:23.289
Is there any other reason besides
your enthusiasm for water sports?

42:23.372 --> 42:25.791
Perhaps this, sir.

42:27.084 --> 42:28.669
Well?

42:28.753 --> 42:31.839
There was a photograph
of that man in your dossier.

42:31.922 --> 42:33.799
His name is Derval.

42:33.883 --> 42:37.553
I saw him last night at Shrublands,
but he was dead.

42:37.636 --> 42:41.932
Not possible. He was seen boarding
the Vulcan. Took off last night.

42:42.016 --> 42:46.228
If 007 says he saw Derval last night
at Shrublands and he was dead,

42:46.312 --> 42:49.190
that's enough for me to initiate enquiries.

42:49.273 --> 42:50.900
Of course.

42:50.983 --> 42:54.320
- Who is this girl?
- Derval's sister, sir.

42:56.113 --> 42:59.241
- Do you know where she is?
- Nassau.

42:59.325 --> 43:01.660
Do you think she's worth going after?

43:02.328 --> 43:06.457
- I wouldn't have put it quite that way.
- You've only got four days.

43:06.540 --> 43:11.212
- Don't spend your time sitting around.
- No, sir. I won't.

43:12.671 --> 43:14.840
Good luck.

43:14.924 --> 43:16.592
Thank you, sir.

43:16.926 --> 43:22.181
Smashing figure. I don't suppose
that has anything to do with your request.

43:22.264 --> 43:26.310
- Was ever a man more misunderstood?
- You can't pull the wool over my eyes.

43:26.394 --> 43:31.607
You may be able to con the old man,
but I know better. I could...

43:31.691 --> 43:33.859
So do I, Miss Moneypenny.

43:33.943 --> 43:38.447
And I'll thank you
not to refer to me as "the old man".

43:39.490 --> 43:42.201
I think I had a hat when I came in.

43:47.581 --> 43:49.208
James...

43:49.291 --> 43:51.585
How else will you recognise her?

43:51.669 --> 43:56.465
Couldn't miss. She has
two moles on the left thigh.

44:59.320 --> 45:02.573
- Thank you, Mr...?
- James Bond.

45:02.656 --> 45:06.327
I arrived soon after you went down.
I've been admiring your form.

45:06.410 --> 45:10.331
Have you now? Your name's James Bond
and you've been admiring my form?

45:10.414 --> 45:13.709
Most girls just paddle around.
You swim like a man.

45:13.793 --> 45:15.711
So do you.

45:15.795 --> 45:19.173
I've had quite a bit of practice.
Do you come here often?

45:19.256 --> 45:22.385
Whenever I'm bored.
Practically every day.

45:22.468 --> 45:26.806
- What else do you do, and where?
- You don't waste time, do you?

45:26.889 --> 45:28.682
- No.
- For effort.

45:28.766 --> 45:32.561
Thank you.
I'll wear it, so you'll know me next time.

45:32.645 --> 45:34.730
I was right. Couldn't miss.

45:34.814 --> 45:37.525
- I'm not with you.
- You soon will be.

45:41.195 --> 45:44.615
- Paula. Give me a hand, will you?
- Get in.

45:47.993 --> 45:50.454
Tell London I made contact with the girl.

45:50.538 --> 45:56.961
It's not what I'd call contact,
but I'll pass it through you've seen the girl.

45:57.044 --> 45:58.879
Keep trying.

45:58.963 --> 46:01.298
It won't start.

46:07.930 --> 46:11.976
Our motor's conked out.
Are you going near Coral Harbour?

46:12.059 --> 46:14.061
I wasn't, but I could.

46:14.145 --> 46:17.314
I've a very important appointment there.

46:17.398 --> 46:19.150
Come aboard.

46:19.233 --> 46:22.737
- You don't mind taking the service boat?
- Not at all.

46:23.487 --> 46:25.573
Hurry up.

47:04.904 --> 47:09.075
- Perhaps we could lunch by the pool.
- How about your appointment?

47:25.674 --> 47:29.428
- How long have you been out here?
- About three weeks.

47:29.512 --> 47:33.766
- Don't you ever stop asking questions?
- All right, change of tack.

47:33.849 --> 47:38.688
- Have some of my conch chowder.
- You've been reading the wrong books.

47:38.771 --> 47:41.732
- About conch chowder?
- Being an aphrodisiac.

47:41.816 --> 47:44.276
It just so happens
that I like conch chowder.

47:49.699 --> 47:53.369
- Friend of yours?
- Works for my guardian.

47:53.452 --> 47:57.456
- Your guardian has you watched?
- He likes to know where I am.

47:57.540 --> 47:59.959
I don't blame him.

48:06.215 --> 48:09.427
- Will you excuse me?
- You're not going so soon?

48:09.510 --> 48:13.514
I'm afraid so.
My guardian's yacht.

48:13.597 --> 48:16.809
- Really?
- He'll be expecting me.

48:16.892 --> 48:20.438
- May I come, meet your guardian?
- No.

48:20.521 --> 48:23.232
- Will I see you again?
- It's a small island.

48:23.315 --> 48:25.735
- Perhaps we can have dinner.
- No.

48:25.818 --> 48:29.488
- My dear, uncooperative Domino.
- How do you know that?

48:29.572 --> 48:32.575
How do you know
my friends call me Domino?

48:32.658 --> 48:34.744
It's on the bracelet on your ankle.

48:34.827 --> 48:37.747
What sharp little eyes you've got.

48:39.415 --> 48:41.542
Wait till you get to my teeth.

48:50.468 --> 48:53.596
Bye, then.
See you tomorrow on the beach.

49:26.921 --> 49:29.423
- £500, please.
- <i>Certainement, monsieur.</i>

49:29.507 --> 49:31.592
Thanks.

49:33.886 --> 49:36.097
Sorry.

49:36.180 --> 49:37.765
- There.
- Thank you.

49:37.848 --> 49:42.186
<i>Rien ne va plus.</i>
<i>Les jeux sont faits.</i>

49:48.567 --> 49:50.653
- 200.
- <i>Deux cents livres banco.</i>

49:53.114 --> 49:55.116
<i>Banco.</i>

50:03.457 --> 50:04.667
<i>Carte.</i>

50:09.839 --> 50:12.174
- Eight.
- <i>Huit à la banque.</i>

50:12.258 --> 50:14.552
Someone has to lose.

50:14.635 --> 50:18.180
Yes, I thought I saw
a spectre at your shoulder.

50:18.264 --> 50:20.141
What do you mean?

50:20.224 --> 50:23.519
The spectre of defeat.
That your luck was due to change.

50:23.602 --> 50:28.274
We'll soon find out.
Any objection to raise the limit, say £500?

50:28.357 --> 50:30.484
- Too big for me.
- Count me out, too.

50:30.568 --> 50:34.864
Perhaps you'd like to take the shoe.
My friend won't mind, Mr...?

50:34.947 --> 50:37.616
- Bond.
- Oh, yes. Mr Bond.

50:38.451 --> 50:41.287
One of my associates spoke about you.

50:41.370 --> 50:43.664
Nothing bad, I hope.

50:43.748 --> 50:48.753
- <i>Un banco de cinq cents livres.</i>
- It's your spectre against mine.

50:48.836 --> 50:50.921
You wish to put the evil eye on me, hm?

50:51.005 --> 50:54.133
We have a way to deal with that
where I come from.

50:54.216 --> 50:58.220
Well, you may hex me.
Let's see what it does for the cards.

50:58.304 --> 51:00.389
- No.
- <i>Non?</i>

51:00.473 --> 51:02.558
- Seven.
- Six.

51:04.769 --> 51:07.146
<i>- Suivi.</i>
<i>- Banco suivi.</i>

51:21.077 --> 51:22.912
- Eight.
- <i>Huit à la banque.</i>

51:22.995 --> 51:25.081
- Nine.
- <i>Neuf à la banque.</i>

51:26.207 --> 51:28.959
You seem to be unbeatable, Mr Bond.

51:29.043 --> 51:31.128
This sort of thing can't last.

51:31.212 --> 51:34.382
- Emilio, you promised me a drink.
- Soon, my dear.

51:34.465 --> 51:39.428
- I want to get my money back first.
- May I be allowed to buy the lady a drink?

51:39.512 --> 51:43.015
- I would appreciate that. Thank you.
- Then I must pass the shoe.

51:43.099 --> 51:45.685
<i>La main passe.</i>

51:46.310 --> 51:47.561
<i>Banco.</i>

51:47.645 --> 51:50.272
He'll be impossible
if his luck doesn't change.

51:50.356 --> 51:53.776
Somehow I don't think it will tonight.

51:54.610 --> 51:56.946
Beluga caviar,
Dom Perignon '55.

51:57.029 --> 51:59.115
- Monsieur.
- Thank you.

51:59.907 --> 52:03.119
I understand you're Mr Largo's niece.

52:03.202 --> 52:07.707
It sounds better than... What would
you say? Mistress? Kept woman?

52:07.790 --> 52:10.501
I wouldn't say that.
Where did you meet him?

52:10.584 --> 52:13.838
In Capri. I was there
with my brother François.

52:15.423 --> 52:20.136
Strange.
I found Emilio attractive then.

52:20.970 --> 52:24.473
- Does he live aboard the yacht?
- No. He has a house on the island.

52:24.557 --> 52:26.350
- Must we talk about him?
- No.

52:26.434 --> 52:30.021
- I'd much rather dance.
- So would I.

52:36.485 --> 52:39.113
- Where is your brother now?
- In England.

52:39.196 --> 52:44.326
He's a commandant with NATO.
He's a wonderful person.

52:44.410 --> 52:47.288
The trouble is,
I never meet anyone like him.

52:47.371 --> 52:49.874
Only men like Largo and myself.

52:49.957 --> 52:53.085
- You are not like Largo.
- Really?

52:54.003 --> 52:56.714
Why do you say that?

52:58.382 --> 53:01.135
The way you hold me.

53:05.139 --> 53:06.640
There.

53:12.396 --> 53:17.485
- How long are you staying in Nassau?
- We are going the day after tomorrow.

53:17.568 --> 53:20.780
As I said, we haven't got very much time.

53:20.863 --> 53:23.157
Emilio wants to leave.

53:26.369 --> 53:30.206
Are you sleeping aboard tonight?

53:30.289 --> 53:33.042
I hoped you'd not be so obvious.

53:33.125 --> 53:35.711
When one has little time,
one has to be obvious.

53:35.795 --> 53:38.547
- You know where you can find me.
- Mr Bond.

53:38.631 --> 53:41.175
Your niece is an excellent dancer.

53:41.258 --> 53:44.637
Let me prove I'm as good a loser
as you are a winner.

53:44.720 --> 53:47.807
Come to lunch on Sunday
at Palmyra, my house here.

53:47.890 --> 53:51.352
- Sunday at noon, then.
- My dear.

53:51.435 --> 53:53.604
- Good night.
- Good night.

53:53.688 --> 53:56.982
You must tell me what
Mr Bond had to say, word for word.

53:57.066 --> 54:00.820
- He talked about you, a little.
- What was he saying just then?

54:00.903 --> 54:05.491
- He asked if we'd sleep aboard tonight.
- Interesting.

54:21.298 --> 54:25.052
- My key. It's 304, please.
- Thank you. 304.

54:26.595 --> 54:29.682
- I'm sorry, no mail.
- Thank you.

54:57.877 --> 54:59.962
Paula?

56:02.775 --> 56:04.527
Paula?

56:33.431 --> 56:35.099
Well, hello, 00...

57:01.792 --> 57:03.961
That's a fine way to treat the CIA.

57:04.045 --> 57:07.590
Sorry about that, Felix,
but you were just about to say 007.

57:07.673 --> 57:09.759
Here.

57:11.135 --> 57:14.513
- Have you killed him?
- You know me better than that.

57:14.597 --> 57:17.099
There you go, smiler.

57:18.142 --> 57:22.646
Have you seen everything you came to
see? Go back to your friends and report.

57:22.730 --> 57:25.858
Tell them: The little fish
I throw back into the sea.

57:25.941 --> 57:29.570
- Give it to him.
- You're going to shoot me in the back?

57:29.653 --> 57:31.906
The gun, I mean.

57:35.242 --> 57:37.078
Now move.

57:37.161 --> 57:41.832
- Who was he?
- A small fish, working for a Mr Largo.

57:41.916 --> 57:44.919
He's got a yacht
we should take a look at, later.

57:49.590 --> 57:52.885
- Quist, to see Mr Largo.
- Open up.

58:05.022 --> 58:06.941
Yes?

58:07.024 --> 58:08.442
It's Quist.

58:11.070 --> 58:13.239
Gently, my friend. Gently.

58:14.156 --> 58:16.325
- What did you find?
- Nothing.

58:16.409 --> 58:19.120
- You saw Bond?
- Yes, I saw him.

58:19.203 --> 58:21.706
What happened?

58:25.292 --> 58:28.546
You let him get the better of you.

58:30.256 --> 58:33.467
No. He was a beast.

58:33.551 --> 58:35.261
No. No.

58:35.344 --> 58:37.054
No.

58:37.388 --> 58:39.473
No.

58:55.072 --> 58:58.492
- Hey there. Did you finally make contact?
- You're late.

58:58.576 --> 59:01.412
- Felix Leiter, Pinder, our man here.
- How do you do?

59:01.495 --> 59:03.581
This way, gentlemen.

59:03.664 --> 59:06.792
- Who's the girl?
- Paula Kaplan, my assistant here.

59:15.509 --> 59:19.722
Here is a special announcement
from the Overseas Service of the BBC.

59:19.805 --> 59:24.435
Big Ben struck seven times
at six o'clock this evening

59:24.518 --> 59:30.691
due to a mechanical failure which last
occurred during a violent storm in 1898.

59:30.775 --> 59:33.194
Once again, the headlines...

59:33.277 --> 59:36.530
Obviously stalling for time.

59:38.532 --> 59:40.868
- Oh, no.
- 007.

59:40.951 --> 59:43.704
- What a wonderful surprise.
- For me, too.

59:43.788 --> 59:48.542
I find thus business of equipping you
in the field, on the run, as it were,

59:48.626 --> 59:51.253
highly irregular.

59:51.337 --> 59:55.883
Here we have a Geiger counter.
Useful and unobtrusive.

59:56.342 --> 59:58.511
The sweep hand counts radioactivity.

59:58.594 --> 01:00:02.223
- It's waterproof, of course.
- But of course.

01:00:02.306 --> 01:00:05.935
Now here's something
I want you to use with special care.

01:00:07.478 --> 01:00:09.438
With special care.

01:00:09.522 --> 01:00:12.566
- Everything you give me...
- Is treated with contempt.

01:00:12.650 --> 01:00:18.864
But that's an underwater camera.
It takes eight pictures in rapid succession.

01:00:18.948 --> 01:00:24.036
- Is that clever?
- If it can take pictures in the dark, yes.

01:00:27.248 --> 01:00:30.751
Try to be a little less
than your usual frivolous self.

01:00:30.835 --> 01:00:36.841
Here's a miniature Very pistol,
which fires a red flare, a distress signal.

01:00:36.924 --> 01:00:41.595
- You should keep it on you day and night.
- I resent that remark.

01:00:41.679 --> 01:00:44.056
Here.

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:46.892
Look, do you mind?

01:00:46.976 --> 01:00:50.646
In the event of a rebreather
not being available, use this device.

01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:54.567
For short periods only, of course.
Say, about four minutes.

01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:57.862
- Clever.
- Obviously, you'd use it as a last resort.

01:00:57.945 --> 01:01:03.826
- It closes to a convenient pocket size.
- Assuming one has a convenient pocket.

01:01:04.618 --> 01:01:08.914
Now pay attention. A recently
developed harmless radioactive device.

01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:10.374
Harmless?

01:01:10.458 --> 01:01:16.047
It sends out a homing signal
to a special receiver.

01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:20.926
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- Obviously, you swallow it.

01:01:22.219 --> 01:01:23.512
Now?

01:01:27.224 --> 01:01:30.227
Let's hope she'll be lying
in the same place tonight.

01:01:30.311 --> 01:01:34.315
We'll use this catamaran
as a rendezvous place for later.

01:01:34.398 --> 01:01:37.902
- Good idea.
- Take her in.

01:01:38.569 --> 01:01:44.325
A container will be dropped off the
coast of Burma in the Mergui Archipelago,

01:01:44.408 --> 01:01:49.789
latitude 20 degrees north,
longitude 60 degrees east,

01:01:49.872 --> 01:01:54.752
at 2000 hours Greenwich Mean Time
on May 27th.

01:01:54.835 --> 01:02:00.674
It will hold blue-white flawless diamonds
between three and eight carats.

01:02:00.758 --> 01:02:06.555
Total value to be not less than
£100 million, present market price.

01:02:06.639 --> 01:02:10.976
After we have recovered the container
and verified its contents,

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:15.981
you will be notified
on radio frequency 16.23 megacycles

01:02:16.065 --> 01:02:18.651
where the atomic bombs
may be recovered.

01:02:20.319 --> 01:02:23.864
- Kenniston, get on to De Beers at once.
- Yes, sir.

01:02:23.948 --> 01:02:29.995
Gentlemen, unless the bombs are found,
I'm afraid we'll have to pay their price.

01:02:30.079 --> 01:02:32.289
Sir.

01:02:32.373 --> 01:02:37.420
Yes. Signal from 007 in Nassau.
One or two things that might interest us.

01:02:37.962 --> 01:02:43.259
The <i>Disco Volante</i> is still in the harbour.
The catamaran too, so we have our cover.

01:02:43.342 --> 01:02:46.429
Fine. Drop me in the water behind her.

01:02:46.512 --> 01:02:51.392
- Any further news from London?
- Zero hour is still 2000 hours on the 27th.

01:02:51.475 --> 01:02:55.771
- That's just 55 hours from now.
- Yes. Shall we go?

01:02:59.233 --> 01:03:02.153
- OK. This'll do here.
- We'll meet back at Pinder's.

01:03:02.236 --> 01:03:04.321
Good luck.

01:03:57.541 --> 01:03:59.627
Turn the underwater lights on.

01:04:07.385 --> 01:04:09.470
TV closed circuit.

01:04:30.741 --> 01:04:32.827
Hand grenades.

01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:36.455
Ready.

01:04:43.546 --> 01:04:45.715
Down there.

01:05:00.146 --> 01:05:02.148
There.

01:05:07.695 --> 01:05:09.780
Quick. Launch.

01:05:43.147 --> 01:05:44.815
There's something there.

01:05:51.822 --> 01:05:54.700
That's him. Turn around.

01:06:02.666 --> 01:06:04.835
Hold that.

01:06:04.919 --> 01:06:11.050
- We must have hit him with the propeller.
- Let's get back and tell Largo.

01:06:49.046 --> 01:06:51.132
- Can I have a lift?
- Sure.

01:06:51.215 --> 01:06:54.927
- Thank you. You just about saved my life.
- Really?

01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:59.348
My outboard capsized
so I had to swim ashore.

01:06:59.432 --> 01:07:02.143
How far do you go?

01:07:03.644 --> 01:07:07.314
You'd better fasten your safety belt.

01:07:08.816 --> 01:07:12.319
- What's your name?
- James Bond.

01:07:13.362 --> 01:07:15.656
Fiona Volpe.

01:07:33.299 --> 01:07:36.260
- Do you fly here often?
- Do I make you nervous?

01:07:36.344 --> 01:07:41.265
No. It's just that I have no desire
to be capsized twice in one night.

01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:43.851
At least you won't have to swim ashore.

01:07:49.398 --> 01:07:51.650
Have you been here before, Mr Bond?

01:07:51.734 --> 01:07:56.197
No, I haven't.
But this is the road to Nassau?

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:59.075
Yes, eventually.

01:08:22.305 --> 01:08:26.060
- Well, this is as far as I go.
- Yes, me too. This is my hotel.

01:08:26.143 --> 01:08:29.270
- What a coincidence.
- Yes. So convenient.

01:08:32.024 --> 01:08:34.443
I hope I didn't frighten you.

01:08:34.527 --> 01:08:38.279
- I'm a nervous passenger.
- Some men just don't like to be driven.

01:08:38.363 --> 01:08:42.618
No, some men just don't like
to be taken for a ride.

01:08:51.877 --> 01:08:55.715
Look at this.
An underwater hatch.

01:08:55.798 --> 01:08:58.718
That's how they could leave and get back.

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:02.971
So nobody saw them. The whole
operation was carried out underwater.

01:09:03.055 --> 01:09:05.975
That's where
we'll have to look for the plane.

01:09:06.058 --> 01:09:08.769
I'll bring the prints to the hotel.

01:09:15.234 --> 01:09:19.029
The air force searched the area
250 miles out of Nassau.

01:09:19.113 --> 01:09:21.490
It must be beyond that radius.

01:09:21.573 --> 01:09:24.118
If the <i>Disco Volante</i> was out that night.

01:09:24.201 --> 01:09:29.206
Sure she was, but Harbour Control
said only for six hours.

01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:33.794
She couldn't cover 500 miles
in that time, no.

01:09:33.877 --> 01:09:38.883
About 90 miles is her limit for six hours,
and that's out and back.

01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:45.514
We'll have to go further out.
We'll need more gas for that.

01:09:45.598 --> 01:09:48.768
Let's get back to Nassau.
We haven't got much time.

01:09:48.850 --> 01:09:51.437
You're right, James, we haven't.

01:10:10.081 --> 01:10:11.749
Pull.

01:10:12.416 --> 01:10:17.088
Of course they are watching us, my dear.
What else have they to do?

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:23.135
- You would like Bond dead.
- I can think of no better arrangement.

01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:26.305
Because he tries
to make love to your woman?

01:10:26.389 --> 01:10:30.351
Because he is Bond and, as an enemy
of SPECTRE, should be killed.

01:10:30.434 --> 01:10:31.936
Mark.

01:10:32.561 --> 01:10:35.981
If Bond had died last night
as a result of your hastiness,

01:10:36.065 --> 01:10:40.069
his government would have known
for certain the bombs are here.

01:10:40.152 --> 01:10:43.280
When the time is right,
he will be killed. Pull.

01:10:45.783 --> 01:10:48.244
I shall kill him.

01:10:52.206 --> 01:10:55.835
A separate pool.
For sharks, no less. Move in.

01:10:57.586 --> 01:11:00.089
Hold on that line.

01:11:02.425 --> 01:11:05.678
That's Largo's place, all right.
My next port of call.

01:11:26.073 --> 01:11:27.783
- Mr Largo?
- Yes, sir.

01:11:27.867 --> 01:11:29.368
Thank you.

01:11:46.177 --> 01:11:50.514
- Can I help?
- Why, Mr Bond. Of course you can.

01:11:50.598 --> 01:11:54.477
- That looks particularly inviting.
- Mr Bond.

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:56.896
- Welcome to Palmyra.
- It's a pleasure.

01:11:56.979 --> 01:12:00.191
- I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
- What do you mean?

01:12:00.274 --> 01:12:03.319
I thought perhaps you'd another visitor.

01:12:03.402 --> 01:12:05.696
No.

01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:09.116
That gun.
Looks more fitting for a woman.

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:14.497
- Do you know much about guns?
- No. I know a little about women.

01:12:15.623 --> 01:12:17.500
Mr Janni, Mr Vargas.

01:12:17.583 --> 01:12:20.795
- Mr Vargas, Mr Janni.
- Which is which?

01:12:20.878 --> 01:12:25.925
I thought you might have met
Mr Vargas the other night.

01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:29.011
- Yes, I believe I did.
- Drinks, sir.

01:12:29.095 --> 01:12:34.517
- Rum Collins, Mr Bond?
- Yes. Just about that hour, isn't it?

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:36.769
For you?

01:12:36.852 --> 01:12:40.398
Of course.
Vargas does not drink. Does not smoke.

01:12:41.649 --> 01:12:44.068
Does not make love.

01:12:44.151 --> 01:12:46.862
What do you do, Vargas?

01:12:47.988 --> 01:12:51.450
Every man has his passion.
Mine is fishing.

01:12:52.493 --> 01:12:54.787
What is yours, Mr Bond?

01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:58.833
Well, I'm not what you'd call
a passionate man.

01:13:04.588 --> 01:13:07.425
I think it's time I went to change.

01:13:08.467 --> 01:13:10.803
You must let me show you around.

01:13:10.886 --> 01:13:15.349
- I'd love that.
- I thought you might.

01:13:15.433 --> 01:13:16.934
Pull.

01:13:17.018 --> 01:13:20.229
- What could be easier?
- Perhaps you'd call one for me.

01:13:20.312 --> 01:13:23.691
- Of course. Pull.
- Seems terribly difficult.

01:13:26.527 --> 01:13:30.031
- No, it isn't, is it?
- No.

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:38.664
I collect big game fish
for various marine institutions.

01:13:38.748 --> 01:13:43.002
- Magnificent creatures.
- Charming.

01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:47.923
The notorious Golden Grotto sharks.
The most savage, the most dangerous.

01:13:48.007 --> 01:13:51.969
They know when it's time
for them to be fed.

01:13:52.053 --> 01:13:55.473
- That boat, is she yours?
- Yes. I'm very proud of her.

01:13:55.556 --> 01:13:57.683
What does she do?
About 15 knots?

01:13:57.767 --> 01:14:00.978
Better than that. Near 20.

01:14:01.062 --> 01:14:04.690
- Perhaps you'd like to see over her.
- Yes, I would, very much.

01:14:04.774 --> 01:14:07.777
- Emilio, lunch is ready.
- Thank you, my darling.

01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:10.738
Come, Mr Bond.
The conch chowder smells delicious.

01:14:10.821 --> 01:14:14.575
Domino, I was just thinking.
As I'll be busy this evening,

01:14:14.658 --> 01:14:18.329
perhaps Mr Bond will be kind enough
to take you to the Junkanoo.

01:14:18.412 --> 01:14:21.916
It's our local Mardi Gras.
You'll be my guest tonight.

01:14:21.999 --> 01:14:24.627
- That's very kind of you.
- My pleasure.

01:14:30.716 --> 01:14:34.387
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:37.390
Our Mr Bond must have
a very high opinion of himself.

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:39.767
- Opinion?
- Yes.

01:14:39.850 --> 01:14:41.977
He has a date with me, too.

01:14:45.481 --> 01:14:47.775
Excuse me.

01:15:02.915 --> 01:15:06.001
- Let me go. Let me go. No.
- Over here.

01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:07.920
No.

01:15:09.088 --> 01:15:12.299
Don't let her make so much noise.
Use the chloroform.

01:15:44.623 --> 01:15:47.793
Largo did promise he'd come, didn't he?

01:15:47.877 --> 01:15:50.796
He'll be here, don't worry.

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:53.341
James, I think that man's waving at you.

01:15:53.424 --> 01:15:56.302
James. Come down here.

01:15:56.385 --> 01:15:58.721
Quick.

01:15:59.221 --> 01:16:02.433
Excuse me for a second.

01:16:03.351 --> 01:16:05.436
James, Paula's gone.

01:16:05.519 --> 01:16:09.315
- What do you mean?
- She just checked out of the hotel.

01:16:09.398 --> 01:16:11.567
You look after Domino.

01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:16.322
- You think she was on to something?
- I've got to find out. Watch out for her.

01:16:16.739 --> 01:16:18.824
All right. Thank you.

01:16:20.117 --> 01:16:24.121
You'll have your power cut,
as requested, all over the island.

01:16:24.205 --> 01:16:28.959
- I just want the lights out in Palmyra.
- You'll have it.

01:16:58.114 --> 01:17:02.493
- What do you mean, she won't talk?
- Don't worry. She will.

01:17:02.576 --> 01:17:04.829
What's wrong?

01:17:08.791 --> 01:17:12.128
- Dimitri. Is it a power failure?
- Yes. All over the island.

01:17:12.211 --> 01:17:16.090
- Switch over to the emergency generator.
- Yes, sir.

01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:54.545
Largo told you to be careful.

01:17:54.628 --> 01:17:58.132
I didn't kill her.
She must have taken some poison.

01:17:58.215 --> 01:18:01.260
A capsule in the mouth. Cyanide?

01:18:02.887 --> 01:18:05.556
She's dead.

01:18:21.322 --> 01:18:24.200
- What's happened?
- Ricardo. Someone's got him.

01:18:31.874 --> 01:18:35.419
Search that way.
And you, the shark pool.

01:18:39.465 --> 01:18:43.427
What happened?
Leave him. This way.

01:18:49.725 --> 01:18:51.394
Stop it.

01:18:51.477 --> 01:18:55.106
You fools.
He's got you all shooting at each other.

01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:57.900
It started down there.

01:19:05.157 --> 01:19:07.243
Over here.

01:19:40.109 --> 01:19:42.570
No, no. I've got a better idea.

01:20:00.504 --> 01:20:04.592
- Lift the tunnel hatch and let them eat.
- Yes, sir.

01:21:16.789 --> 01:21:19.500
Sorry, old chap.
Better luck next time.

01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:29.969
Tell Leiter to stay with the girl.
I'll get back to him soon.

01:21:30.052 --> 01:21:32.555
- Anything else?
- Tell him Paula's dead.

01:22:12.011 --> 01:22:13.804
Hello.

01:22:13.888 --> 01:22:18.309
- Aren't you in the wrong room, Mr Bond?
- Not from where I'm standing.

01:22:20.478 --> 01:22:24.565
Since you are here, would you mind
giving me something to put on?

01:22:39.663 --> 01:22:44.293
- I'm very glad to see you again, Mr Bond.
- I'm glad to see you again.

01:22:45.044 --> 01:22:50.466
- I had a feeling you've been avoiding me.
- Well, I had no idea we were neighbours.

01:22:50.549 --> 01:22:55.388
They moved me down this afternoon.
It's extraordinary. Almost as if...

01:22:55.471 --> 01:22:57.932
As if it was intended.

01:22:58.015 --> 01:23:00.976
Yes, it is extraordinary.

01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:07.316
Shouldn't you get out of those wet
clothes? You'll catch your death of cold.

01:23:13.948 --> 01:23:16.742
Now look.
You know we're going to be too late.

01:23:16.826 --> 01:23:19.704
- Too late for what?
- The Junkanoo.

01:23:19.787 --> 01:23:25.876
I promised my friends I'd meet them there.
Perhaps you know them. The Largos.

01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:29.213
Questions, questions.
All I get is questions.

01:23:29.296 --> 01:23:31.757
But the music is gonna
go on all night anyhow.

01:23:31.841 --> 01:23:34.051
- Enough to drive you wild.
- Really?

01:23:34.135 --> 01:23:38.055
Do you like wild things,
Mr Bond, James Bond?

01:23:39.181 --> 01:23:42.518
Wild? You should be locked up in a cage.

01:23:48.357 --> 01:23:52.695
This bed feels like a cage.
All these bars.

01:23:52.778 --> 01:23:56.157
Do you think I'll be safe?

01:24:08.085 --> 01:24:12.340
You made a shocking mess
out of my hair, you sadistic brute.

01:24:12.423 --> 01:24:14.508
Will you zip me up, please?

01:24:17.386 --> 01:24:20.014
No wonder you can
get dressed so quickly.

01:24:20.097 --> 01:24:24.602
On the way we can have a little talk.
You may find it interesting.

01:24:24.685 --> 01:24:27.188
- Come on.
- I'm coming.

01:24:27.271 --> 01:24:30.399
I hate to think I'm gonna miss anything.

01:24:33.027 --> 01:24:37.865
- Now we can have an interesting talk.
- Friends of yours, no doubt.

01:24:37.948 --> 01:24:40.034
Come in.

01:24:42.119 --> 01:24:46.082
You dress quickly too.
I didn't see that gun in the mirror.

01:24:46.165 --> 01:24:51.379
Not that it matters,
but that was under the pillow all the time.

01:24:52.421 --> 01:24:58.344
- And when did you find out?
- You're wearing the same ring as Largo.

01:24:58.427 --> 01:25:01.597
- It's a ring I like to wear.
- Vanity has its dangers.

01:25:01.681 --> 01:25:06.602
Vanity, Mr Bond, is something
you know so much about.

01:25:06.686 --> 01:25:10.856
Don't flatter yourself. What I did
this evening was for king and country.

01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:14.235
You don't think it gave me
any pleasure, do you?

01:25:19.281 --> 01:25:22.326
But of course.
I forgot your ego, Mr Bond.

01:25:22.410 --> 01:25:28.040
James Bond, who makes love to a woman
and she hears heavenly choirs singing.

01:25:28.124 --> 01:25:32.920
She repents and returns
to the side of right and virtue.

01:25:34.255 --> 01:25:37.008
But not this one.

01:25:38.175 --> 01:25:42.638
What a blow it must have been,
you having a failure.

01:25:42.722 --> 01:25:45.766
Well, you can't win them all.

01:25:46.809 --> 01:25:49.812
We'll take him out the front way.
Go and get the car.

01:25:49.895 --> 01:25:52.189
Careful, Mr Bond. Careful.

01:26:08.497 --> 01:26:09.915
Now look.

01:26:12.835 --> 01:26:17.089
Get through to Palmyra. Tell them
we've been held up by the Junkanoo.

01:26:17.173 --> 01:26:20.551
- Like a drink, man?
- Get him away. Don't try anything.

01:26:20.634 --> 01:26:22.762
- Get out of here.
- It's real firewater.

01:26:22.845 --> 01:26:27.099
- Get out of it. Get out of here.
- Have a sip. It can't harm you.

01:26:33.397 --> 01:26:35.232
Go after him.

01:26:52.124 --> 01:26:54.210
- You haven't seen anything?
- No.

01:26:54.293 --> 01:26:55.961
Look.

01:26:56.045 --> 01:26:59.298
Follow it.
You, that side. You, there.

01:28:01.861 --> 01:28:04.780
Stay with us now.

01:30:01.731 --> 01:30:04.150
- Thank you. I'd love to.
- Love to what?

01:30:07.987 --> 01:30:10.322
You're mad.
Do you know that?

01:30:10.406 --> 01:30:12.908
Yes. Isn't everyone?

01:30:16.245 --> 01:30:19.665
- May I cut in?
- You should've said your wife was here.

01:30:31.177 --> 01:30:36.807
- Do you come here often?
- It's no good trying to escape, Mr Bond.

01:30:36.891 --> 01:30:38.976
I don't want to escape.

01:30:39.977 --> 01:30:44.857
Strange as it may seem,
I've grown accustomed to your face.

01:30:54.909 --> 01:30:58.371
Why don't you come with us quietly?

01:30:58.454 --> 01:31:02.083
You don't seem to understand.
You see, I enjoy my dancing.

01:31:40.830 --> 01:31:45.418
Mind if my friend sits this one out?
She's just dead.

01:31:55.761 --> 01:32:00.599
You'll leave here at 0600 hours
and land at Aden to refuel.

01:32:00.683 --> 01:32:04.520
You will then go to the Mergui
Archipelago to make your drop,

01:32:04.603 --> 01:32:08.315
precisely at 20 degrees north,
60 degrees east.

01:32:08.399 --> 01:32:11.277
The diamonds will be in a container...

01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:16.240
I hate to give in on this. Paying them
blood money. Letting them beat us.

01:32:16.323 --> 01:32:19.577
- Have you an alternative?
- I'm afraid I haven't.

01:32:19.660 --> 01:32:23.581
- I thought 007 was on to something.
- I thought so too, sir.

01:32:23.664 --> 01:32:25.750
- False alarm?
- Afraid so.

01:32:25.833 --> 01:32:29.337
He has a highly developed sense of...
shall we say drama?

01:32:29.420 --> 01:32:34.592
- If 007 thought he was on to something...
- Pity he didn't make sure first.

01:32:34.675 --> 01:32:37.428
We have exactly 14 hours and 50 minutes.

01:32:37.511 --> 01:32:41.807
Then we shall have to pay up
and look as happy as we can, shan't we?

01:33:19.428 --> 01:33:21.931
We've looked about everywhere.

01:33:22.014 --> 01:33:25.059
We've got to find that plane.

01:33:26.519 --> 01:33:31.315
You won't find it down there.
That's the Golden Grotto.

01:33:31.399 --> 01:33:33.275
Golden Grotto?

01:33:33.359 --> 01:33:36.487
Yeah. All you'll find down there is sharks.

01:33:37.613 --> 01:33:40.449
- Take it down. I want a closer look.
- At what?

01:33:40.533 --> 01:33:42.243
Quick.

01:33:49.583 --> 01:33:51.711
I think we've found it.

01:34:03.764 --> 01:34:07.727
There's something camouflaged
down there. I'll take a look.

01:34:07.810 --> 01:34:11.105
Shoot a shark.
It'll keep the others occupied.

01:34:21.115 --> 01:34:25.161
I don't know how long the others
will take, but they'll be back.

01:34:25.244 --> 01:34:28.205
- I'll keep an eye on them.
- Good.

01:36:33.706 --> 01:36:35.916
Take these.

01:36:39.545 --> 01:36:41.881
- She's down there.
- Are the bombs on board?

01:36:41.964 --> 01:36:42.715
No.

01:36:42.798 --> 01:36:46.886
- Great. What's our next move?
- We'll check on the <i>Disco Volante</i>.

01:36:46.969 --> 01:36:49.388
If the bombs aren't on board now,
they soon will be.

01:36:49.472 --> 01:36:52.141
Who are you going to ask? Largo?

01:36:52.224 --> 01:36:55.353
No, I don't think we'll have to.

01:37:49.031 --> 01:37:52.159
I hope we didn't frighten the fish.

01:37:55.788 --> 01:37:58.207
Sea egg spines.
They're poisonous.

01:37:58.290 --> 01:38:00.960
Here. Give me your arm.

01:38:03.713 --> 01:38:06.340
Sit down.

01:38:06.424 --> 01:38:08.551
Now turn over.

01:38:10.845 --> 01:38:13.556
This is going to hurt a bit.

01:38:21.814 --> 01:38:24.483
It's the first time I've tasted women.

01:38:24.567 --> 01:38:30.281
You're the only man to ever make me cry.
Except François, my brother.

01:38:30.364 --> 01:38:33.284
Domino, I have to tell you something.

01:38:35.411 --> 01:38:39.332
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to embarrass you,
speaking of love.

01:38:39.415 --> 01:38:42.835
- I must hurt you again.
- You're going away.

01:38:42.918 --> 01:38:46.922
- "Sorry, my dear. It's all over."
- No, it's about your brother.

01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:50.134
What about him?

01:39:02.355 --> 01:39:04.023
François...

01:39:09.195 --> 01:39:11.280
He's...

01:39:16.118 --> 01:39:18.954
He's dead?

01:39:21.499 --> 01:39:24.835
- What happened?
- It's a long story.

01:39:24.919 --> 01:39:27.880
And it involves your friend, Largo.

01:39:39.433 --> 01:39:41.560
Domino, I need your help.

01:39:41.644 --> 01:39:45.731
Of course.
That's why you made love to me.

01:39:45.815 --> 01:39:49.860
I can't explain what this is all about,
but you must trust me.

01:39:49.944 --> 01:39:54.532
- Because you want me to help you?
- Look, Largo had your brother murdered.

01:39:54.615 --> 01:39:59.829
Hundreds of thousands of people
will die soon if you don't help me.

01:40:04.750 --> 01:40:07.753
That much we do know.
But there's something we don't.

01:40:07.837 --> 01:40:11.132
The bombs - when they'll be loaded
aboard the <i>Disco Volante</i>.

01:40:11.215 --> 01:40:15.386
- How could I know that?
- That you'll have to find out.

01:40:16.429 --> 01:40:19.306
It won't be easy.
It could be very dangerous.

01:40:19.390 --> 01:40:22.351
What can he do to me
he hasn't already done?

01:40:22.435 --> 01:40:24.311
You'll do it?

01:40:26.397 --> 01:40:28.941
- Yes.
- Good.

01:40:29.025 --> 01:40:34.488
This is a Geiger counter. Press this.
If it starts clicking, the bombs are aboard.

01:40:34.572 --> 01:40:37.950
- What do I do then?
- Go straight up on deck.

01:40:38.034 --> 01:40:41.579
As the <i>Disco Volante</i> is being watched,
you'll be spotted.

01:40:41.662 --> 01:40:43.998
Vargas is behind you.

01:40:45.041 --> 01:40:46.792
Really?

01:40:49.086 --> 01:40:51.213
He must have followed us.

01:40:55.843 --> 01:41:00.222
- I think he got the point.
- It should have been Largo.

01:41:00.306 --> 01:41:01.849
Largo...

01:41:01.932 --> 01:41:04.643
- When did he expect you back?
- Very soon.

01:41:04.727 --> 01:41:08.564
He said not to be late.
He was most insistent.

01:41:08.647 --> 01:41:13.069
- You go back. I'll take care of Vargas.
- James...

01:41:13.152 --> 01:41:15.654
I'm doing this for my brother.
For what he did to him.

01:41:15.738 --> 01:41:19.158
Promise you will kill Largo for me,
whatever happens.

01:41:23.996 --> 01:41:26.165
- You haven't much time.
- All right.

01:41:26.248 --> 01:41:30.044
- It may not be important.
- Everything is.

01:41:30.127 --> 01:41:34.632
There's a small bridge over the canal.
Largo never allows strangers near it.

01:41:34.715 --> 01:41:38.135
- By it is a flight of steps.
- Where do they lead to?

01:41:38.219 --> 01:41:41.222
Down into the sea,
on the far side of Palmyra.

01:41:41.305 --> 01:41:43.933
Perhaps it is important, after all.

01:43:14.774 --> 01:43:17.693
Put on your equipment.

01:43:33.959 --> 01:43:37.588
- Did the girl go on board the <i>Disco</i> ?
- Yes, sir. Signal received at...

01:43:37.672 --> 01:43:41.425
- OK. If she is on board, where's 007?
- That's a question.

01:43:44.178 --> 01:43:46.472
Stand by. Five seconds.

01:43:47.223 --> 01:43:49.475
Watch my signal.

01:44:33.978 --> 01:44:36.897
Prepare to get under way.

01:44:40.359 --> 01:44:42.778
Captain, weigh anchor.

01:44:42.862 --> 01:44:44.947
Get under way immediately.

01:44:45.031 --> 01:44:50.036
Once we pick up the merchandise,
head for our target area, Miami.

01:44:57.960 --> 01:44:59.628
The <i>Disco</i>'s leaving.

01:49:08.878 --> 01:49:11.964
- I told you to stay in your cabin.
- I want a breath of air.

01:49:12.048 --> 01:49:14.550
My dear, did you not hear me?

01:49:14.633 --> 01:49:17.928
- Where did you get that?
- I bought it this morning.

01:49:24.727 --> 01:49:28.647
Mr Bond gave you this little toy, I imagine.

01:49:28.731 --> 01:49:31.442
And Vargas is dead.

01:49:33.861 --> 01:49:36.864
No, my dear, there is no escape for you.

01:49:36.947 --> 01:49:41.577
Like your friend, you've been a little
too clever, and now you are caught.

01:50:29.166 --> 01:50:32.962
You've given me much pleasure, Domino.

01:50:33.045 --> 01:50:37.049
But in return, unless you tell me
how much Bond knows,

01:50:37.133 --> 01:50:40.302
I'll be forced to cause you great pain.

01:50:40.386 --> 01:50:44.306
This for heat, these for cold.

01:50:44.390 --> 01:50:48.185
Applied scientifically and slowly.

01:50:48.269 --> 01:50:51.397
Very, very slowly.

01:51:02.450 --> 01:51:04.744
- What do you want?
- We're activating the bombs.

01:51:04.827 --> 01:51:06.912
- You said to tell you.
- Yes.

01:51:09.248 --> 01:51:13.461
A private little matter, my friend,
between the young woman and myself.

01:51:13.544 --> 01:51:15.171
Go.

01:51:15.254 --> 01:51:19.633
Do not live in hope, my dear.
There is no one to rescue you.

01:51:34.690 --> 01:51:36.484
Now go on.

01:51:36.567 --> 01:51:41.989
It's a good thing the homing capsule he
swallowed is still working. Straight ahead.

01:51:47.328 --> 01:51:49.622
Go right. Go on right.

01:52:10.726 --> 01:52:12.812
That's him.

01:52:28.077 --> 01:52:29.829
Hold it.

01:52:40.339 --> 01:52:41.257
Up.

01:52:55.396 --> 01:52:58.607
Get your radio man on to Orlando Beach.

01:52:58.691 --> 01:53:01.193
Warn them the target is Miami.

01:53:01.277 --> 01:53:06.365
The bomb is transferred from the <i>Disco</i>
<i>Volante</i> onto a wreck off Fowley Point.

01:53:06.449 --> 01:53:08.909
Right. Hang on to that.

01:55:57.745 --> 01:56:01.582
- And the kitchen sink.
- On you, everything looks good.

01:56:02.458 --> 01:56:04.543
Take this.

01:56:09.548 --> 01:56:11.467
Good luck.

02:03:15.933 --> 02:03:18.352
- Weigh anchor.
- Aye aye, sir.

02:03:46.297 --> 02:03:49.133
- Make smoke.
- Making smoke now.

02:03:56.724 --> 02:03:59.894
- Stand by for conversion.
- Standing by.

02:04:03.606 --> 02:04:05.775
Jettison cocoon.

02:04:12.865 --> 02:04:14.950
Cocoon's away.

02:04:27.463 --> 02:04:30.633
Keep firing. They're closing.

02:04:49.610 --> 02:04:53.572
Come on. Fire.
More. Over there.

02:05:05.543 --> 02:05:07.878
Away from there.

02:05:07.962 --> 02:05:10.715
We've still got one bomb aboard.

02:05:11.173 --> 02:05:15.594
He's gone mad.
Please talk to them for me.

02:05:15.678 --> 02:05:19.015
Tell them I only did what I had to do.
What I was told to do.

02:05:31.861 --> 02:05:35.448
- Where is he?
- The bomb cannot be exploded now.

02:05:35.531 --> 02:05:37.616
I threw the arming device into the sea.

02:05:37.700 --> 02:05:39.869
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

02:05:49.211 --> 02:05:51.005
Get him.

02:07:34.734 --> 02:07:38.612
- I'm glad I killed him.
- You're glad.

02:07:38.696 --> 02:07:42.116
- Who's he?
- I don't know but he helped me.

02:07:42.199 --> 02:07:45.745
- Look out. The rocks.
- The reef.

02:07:47.621 --> 02:07:49.915
He's jammed the controls. Come on.

02:07:49.999 --> 02:07:50.750
Jump.

02:07:50.833 --> 02:07:53.252
- I can't swim.
- Never too late to learn.

02:07:57.214 --> 02:07:59.425
Get down.

02:10:04.842 --> 02:10:07.970
