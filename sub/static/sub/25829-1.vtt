(chopping)

00:20.321 --> 00:23.257
(doorbell ringing)

00:39.307 --> 00:40.508
- Happy New Year.

00:40.541 --> 00:41.475
- Sharon.

00:41.509 --> 00:42.443
- Is my little man around?

00:42.476 --> 00:43.611
- Uh no, he's actually not,

00:43.644 --> 00:45.646
but he should be any minute.

00:45.679 --> 00:48.516
- Oh, I gotta give him
his New Year's present.

00:48.549 --> 00:49.350
- Right.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.318
His New Year's present.

00:50.351 --> 00:51.852
- Sure, silly.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.222
I get him one every year.

00:54.255 --> 00:56.524
Let's see, what did
I get him last year?

00:56.557 --> 00:57.591
Oh.

00:57.625 --> 01:00.428
The silk boxer shorts I got him.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.699
Hey, what do we have here?

01:06.667 --> 01:08.769
Some gobble gobble?

01:08.802 --> 01:11.439
It's New Year's,
not Thanksgiving.

01:11.472 --> 01:14.108
- Yeah, I thought it would
be a nice holiday dish.

01:14.142 --> 01:18.312
- Oh, honey, you cook it that
way you're gonna dry it out.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.216
- Did you,

01:22.250 --> 01:23.517
can you stay for dinner?

01:23.551 --> 01:24.352
- Hm?

01:24.385 --> 01:25.186
No, no, no.

01:25.219 --> 01:26.720
You two go ahead.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.456
Ken's taking me to one of
those shi-shi restaurants

01:28.489 --> 01:30.724
he's always so excited about.

01:30.758 --> 01:33.227
Made reservations months ago.

01:33.261 --> 01:34.094
Mm.

01:34.828 --> 01:35.629
Mm.

01:35.663 --> 01:37.365
Speaking of which,

01:38.566 --> 01:40.534
what's the date of
the wedding again?

01:40.568 --> 01:42.270
- August 27th.

01:42.303 --> 01:43.537
- I knew it.

01:43.571 --> 01:46.307
Can't make it, you'll
have to reschedule.

01:46.340 --> 01:47.441
- Reschedule?

01:48.576 --> 01:50.411
But you said you
were free all summer.

01:50.444 --> 01:51.712
- Well I am.

01:51.745 --> 01:53.181
We were.

01:53.214 --> 01:55.183
But, Ken's got this
cruise voucher and that's

01:55.216 --> 01:58.186
the only weekend they can
take us before it expires.

01:58.219 --> 02:00.788
- But I've already booked
the hall and everything.

02:00.821 --> 02:03.491
- So, book another weekend.

02:03.524 --> 02:05.293
Don't worry so much.

02:05.326 --> 02:07.161
It's still a ways off.

02:08.762 --> 02:10.398
Look,

02:10.431 --> 02:14.435
there is no way I am missing
my only child's wedding.

02:14.468 --> 02:17.538
You have to reschedule,
end of story.

02:19.540 --> 02:20.741
So,

02:20.774 --> 02:22.776
how is the baby?

02:22.810 --> 02:24.578
Happy and healthy?

02:24.612 --> 02:27.315
Oh yeah, he's coming
along alright.

02:27.348 --> 02:28.649
God, I can't believe
my little man

02:28.682 --> 02:29.917
is having a baby.

02:34.388 --> 02:35.223
Come on.

02:35.856 --> 02:36.690
Loosen up.

02:38.659 --> 02:41.262
You're liable to scare him off
with an attitude like that.

02:41.295 --> 02:42.630
Don't you think?

02:49.237 --> 02:50.671
- Thanks, Sharon.

02:56.844 --> 02:59.447
(slow instrumental music)

02:59.480 --> 03:01.749
(grumbling)

03:02.683 --> 03:06.854
(stomping)
(grumbling)

03:09.557 --> 03:12.860
(slow instrumental music)

03:24.705 --> 03:27.741
(slow, tinkling music)

03:38.752 --> 03:42.723
* I get so restless I feel
trapped inside my body

03:46.827 --> 03:50.898
* Won't someone reach out

03:50.931 --> 03:53.267
* And rescue me

03:53.301 --> 03:55.703
* I can't settle down,
settle down, settle down

03:55.736 --> 03:59.307
* Settle down, settle down

04:02.643 --> 04:04.512
* It's not the meds

04:04.545 --> 04:08.716
* It's not the
drag of decomposing

04:10.784 --> 04:14.888
* I can't help this feeling

04:14.922 --> 04:16.923
* I'm floating

04:16.957 --> 04:19.726
* But anchored down, to
the ground, to my bones

04:19.760 --> 04:23.331
* To my own mortal address

04:26.767 --> 04:30.938
* And if you would
only cut the cord

04:32.340 --> 04:35.743
* Well I wonder what my
grandfather would think

04:35.776 --> 04:39.780
* 50 years sweating
for his family

04:39.813 --> 04:42.916
* He knew how to settle down

04:42.950 --> 04:46.920
* Settle down, settle
down, settle down

04:53.461 --> 04:57.631
(upbeat acoustic
orchestral music)

05:13.814 --> 05:14.815
- Hey Pearly.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.750
Oh, did you have a good day?

05:16.784 --> 05:17.618
Oh.

05:18.719 --> 05:19.553
Hello?

05:26.627 --> 05:27.461
Hello?

05:29.162 --> 05:30.831
It smells fantastic.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.802
(slow music)

05:40.841 --> 05:42.676
- It's just one glass.

05:44.712 --> 05:46.380
Your mom stopped by.

05:47.848 --> 05:48.916
- I guess so.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.051
What'd she say?

05:54.187 --> 05:56.924
- Come on, open your
New Year's gift.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.392
- Yeah, I know.

05:59.593 --> 06:01.429
I know it's kind of weird.

06:01.462 --> 06:05.032
- Yeah, not to mention
you're 33 years old.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.001
- What did she,

06:09.169 --> 06:12.773
name some other ex-girlfriends
she likes so much more?

06:12.806 --> 06:16.910
- She told me we have to
move the fucking wedding day.

06:16.944 --> 06:18.178
- Oh, pants!

06:18.211 --> 06:20.648
Jean, look, pants.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.015
So, we'll move the date.

06:22.049 --> 06:22.950
It's not set in stone, is it?

06:22.983 --> 06:25.118
- I already booked the hall.

06:25.152 --> 06:27.020
- Well re-book it.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.221
- They're all booked up.

06:28.255 --> 06:31.859
I mean, they're not all booked
up but they're booking up.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.527
Excuse me, Pearl.

06:34.595 --> 06:35.896
- Hon.

06:35.929 --> 06:36.930
Come on.

06:36.964 --> 06:37.898
Relax.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.900
We'll just pick another date.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.068
Why couldn't she make it?

06:41.101 --> 06:43.504
- A fucking cruise.
(laughing)

06:43.537 --> 06:47.908
Ugh, her and Ken wanna go on
some goddamn wind jammer cruise

06:47.941 --> 06:50.478
to Turks and Caicos
or some shit.

06:50.511 --> 06:53.413
So I have to
reschedule everything.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.850
- Well it's just a hall, Jesus.

06:56.884 --> 06:57.718
Mm.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.921
You know what, I'll figure
it out after the holidays.

07:00.954 --> 07:01.755
I'll make some calls.

07:01.789 --> 07:03.857
What are havin',
Thanksgiving day?

07:03.891 --> 07:05.526
- Uh no, it is
not just the hall.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.695
It's trying to schedule
with my family.

07:07.728 --> 07:08.896
My friends.

07:08.929 --> 07:09.897
Do you realize how long
it took us to settle

07:09.930 --> 07:10.964
on August 27th?

07:12.800 --> 07:14.535
My parents are in and out
of town all summer long

07:14.568 --> 07:15.803
and when they're
not out of town,

07:15.836 --> 07:16.904
my dad's having his
corrective surgery.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.506
- Well it sounds like your
parents are the problem,

07:18.539 --> 07:19.773
not my parents.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.109
- No.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.777
No.

07:23.811 --> 07:25.713
They are not the problem
because I have been in touch

07:25.746 --> 07:27.581
with them and
scheduling with them

07:27.615 --> 07:30.884
for the past two months
to land on August 27th.

07:30.918 --> 07:33.053
Meanwhile your mom just
stays out of the conversation

07:33.086 --> 07:35.956
and says, "Oh, I'm just
loafing around all summer."

07:35.989 --> 07:37.591
(grumbling)

07:37.625 --> 07:39.693
And then she flippantly
unloads this horse shit on me

07:39.727 --> 07:42.930
about some fab fuck cruise
that's gonna expire.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.231
- That is not good,
now is it, honey?

07:44.264 --> 07:45.666
- No.

07:45.699 --> 07:47.267
And do you know how
many of my stupid

07:47.300 --> 07:49.537
fucking high school
friends decided to get

07:49.570 --> 07:51.772
married this summer?

07:51.805 --> 07:54.174
All the weekends are filled up.

07:56.109 --> 07:59.112
Will you please get a little
upset about this, please?

07:59.146 --> 08:01.515
(scraping)

08:03.016 --> 08:05.052
Cary, it's just some
dumb fucking cruise.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.254
Can't you talk to her?

08:07.287 --> 08:08.288
- Sure.

08:08.321 --> 08:11.124
Sure, I can talk to her.

08:11.158 --> 08:14.127
(soft acoustic music)

08:19.266 --> 08:21.802
- Just stand up to her, hon.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.907
It's our wedding,
she'll understand.

08:26.940 --> 08:27.841
- Eh, okay.

08:29.309 --> 08:32.980
- She's just doing it to
be confrontational anyway.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.914
I will forever be
the other woman.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.149
- Okay, god, don't
get into this.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.051
- What? It's true.

08:38.085 --> 08:40.053
You just don't know
how true it is.

08:40.087 --> 08:41.520
- Okay, whatever.

08:46.093 --> 08:49.196
(soft acoustic music)

08:49.229 --> 08:52.132
- Did you pick up the beets?

08:52.165 --> 08:53.133
- Oh, fuck.

08:53.166 --> 08:54.167
No, I did.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.169
I did, but I must've
left them at The Getaway.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.170
- What?

08:57.204 --> 08:58.739
Cary?

08:58.772 --> 09:00.007
- Fuck, I'm sorry.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.008
I'll just, I can go grab
'em, it's not a problem.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.010
- No, don't worry about it.

09:03.043 --> 09:03.977
I'm the only one who
likes them anyway.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.112
- Yeah, that's why I
should get 'em though.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.346
- No.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.280
- It'll just be
a second, though.

09:07.314 --> 09:09.583
- No, I said it doesn't matter.

09:11.719 --> 09:13.286
- But I feel bad now.

09:17.925 --> 09:20.293
- What were you doing
at The Getaway anyway?

09:20.327 --> 09:23.063
- I just stopped
in for a second.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.601
- Even though I was making
this nice dinner for us?

09:27.635 --> 09:29.637
- Hon, it was just a second.

09:29.670 --> 09:30.938
Just,

09:30.971 --> 09:32.105
they had this new girl
start so they asked me

09:32.139 --> 09:33.206
to train her.

09:37.077 --> 09:37.911
- Why would they ask you?

09:37.945 --> 09:38.912
- You know what?

09:38.946 --> 09:40.113
I left the beets
on the back bar,

09:40.147 --> 09:40.748
so that's where I'll
go get 'em form.

09:40.781 --> 09:41.615
- No.

09:42.650 --> 09:44.217
Fuck it, damage done.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.085
Too late.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.120
- Oh.

09:48.388 --> 09:51.892
I didn't wanna ruin
your nice little spread.

09:51.925 --> 09:52.826
- Bet you wouldn't
have left the bag

09:52.860 --> 09:53.894
if it was mac and cheese.

09:53.927 --> 09:54.862
- Oh!

09:54.895 --> 09:56.129
You're makin' mac and cheese!

09:56.163 --> 09:57.197
- Yeah.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.767
But I'm gonna spit in yours.

10:02.135 --> 10:05.773
Seriously, see how
these pants fit.

10:05.806 --> 10:06.640
- Okay.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.115
- [Jean] Other than the fact
that there's no such thing

10:15.148 --> 10:18.686
as New Year's gifts, it's
odd how close in proximity

10:18.719 --> 10:19.419
it is to Christmas.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.889
Didn't she just get you pants?

10:21.922 --> 10:22.756
- Yeah.

10:27.828 --> 10:28.662
And those,

10:30.297 --> 10:32.399
those were too small too.

10:32.432 --> 10:35.435
- She still thinks
you're her wittle boy.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.270
- 30/30?

10:38.305 --> 10:41.341
Why does she keep
buying me 30/30's?

10:41.374 --> 10:44.277
- It's what you wear, isn't it?

10:44.311 --> 10:47.681
(soft acoustic music)

10:50.217 --> 10:52.853
Why didn't she get me anything
for New Years, I wonder?

10:52.886 --> 10:55.889
- [Cary] You're
not her wittle man.

10:55.923 --> 10:58.258
- I'm gonna be her
daughter, soon, though.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.327
I practically am already.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.365
I know why.

11:05.398 --> 11:08.769
(soft acoustic music)

11:12.039 --> 11:15.108
She really was kind
of a bitch today.

11:26.854 --> 11:28.221
Well, we have about

11:29.923 --> 11:32.325
30 minutes 'til dinner's ready.

11:34.261 --> 11:35.062
What do you wanna do?

11:35.095 --> 11:37.998
- Oh man, no, I'm
really starving.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.801
Do we have any cheese or
crackers I could have?

11:40.834 --> 11:42.469
- I thought maybe you'd
wanna run and get my beets.

11:42.502 --> 11:43.303
- I can.

11:43.336 --> 11:44.972
Yes I can.

11:45.005 --> 11:45.939
Just give me a second, okay?
- No, no, no, no, no.

11:45.973 --> 11:47.374
Totally kidding, come on.

11:47.407 --> 11:48.341
We still have the
Thanksgiving day

11:48.375 --> 11:50.110
parade on the DVR to watch

11:50.143 --> 11:51.779
we never, ever, ever watched.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.046
- You know what?

11:53.080 --> 11:54.214
I thought you might
wanna play some bass.

11:54.247 --> 11:55.883
Yeah, come on.

11:55.916 --> 11:59.787
You're never gonna get
good if you never practice.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.321
- Alright, let's play bass.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.290
- I knew you'd want to.

12:08.862 --> 12:11.331
Okay, you're gonna start
with it open, open.

12:11.364 --> 12:12.265
Yeah, remember this?

12:12.299 --> 12:14.334
You gotta meet it though.

12:14.367 --> 12:17.470
Yeah, so.
(strumming)

12:19.272 --> 12:21.141
Then you're gonna go five, five.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.209
- Five, five.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.476
- Seven, seven.

12:23.510 --> 12:24.978
- Seven...

12:25.012 --> 12:26.346
- Seven, seven.

12:26.379 --> 12:27.180
Oh yeah, try it again.

12:27.214 --> 12:28.015
- Seven, seven.

12:28.048 --> 12:28.882
- Open.

12:29.582 --> 12:30.483
Okay.

12:30.517 --> 12:31.885
What's going on with you?

12:31.919 --> 12:32.820
You were playing
this fine last week.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.154
Have you been practicing?

12:34.187 --> 12:35.322
- No.

12:35.355 --> 12:36.123
- Jean, you're
never gonna get good

12:36.156 --> 12:38.091
if you don't keep at it.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.261
- Well, I do wanna
get good, but when

12:41.294 --> 12:44.164
am I supposed to practice?

12:44.197 --> 12:47.034
- Aren't you at home all day?
(strumming)

12:47.067 --> 12:48.368
- Cary, what do you
think I do all day?

12:48.401 --> 12:50.804
Sit around watching court TV?

12:50.838 --> 12:52.539
- Well no, but it's not
like you're working all day,

12:52.572 --> 12:53.406
every day.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.408
- Uh, yeah.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.278
Yeah, I kinda am.

12:58.311 --> 13:00.147
When I'm not getting the
PR stuff off the ground,

13:00.180 --> 13:01.514
I'm planning our wedding.

13:01.548 --> 13:03.984
Which doesn't have a
firm date, by the way.

13:04.017 --> 13:08.388
- All I'm saying is it takes
a lot of dedication is all.

13:08.421 --> 13:11.358
- Come on, show me
something harder.

13:11.391 --> 13:14.561
- You're not even getting
the easy stuff that well.

13:14.594 --> 13:17.430
- Fine.
(laughing)

13:17.464 --> 13:18.866
- Trust me, you'll never
have to learn anything

13:18.899 --> 13:21.969
more complicated than
that for our band.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.236
- Oh right.

13:23.270 --> 13:26.273
Our band.
(laughing)

13:27.607 --> 13:30.243
I'm starting to think easy
is just code for shitty.

13:30.277 --> 13:32.245
- It is, but it's cool.

13:32.279 --> 13:33.080
It's cool.

13:33.113 --> 13:34.481
But then we can
start doing shows.

13:34.514 --> 13:36.183
- Yeah, we can teach
our baby to play drums.

13:36.216 --> 13:37.450
- Fuck yeah.
(laughing)

13:37.484 --> 13:38.418
And we'll teach her
at a super young age

13:38.451 --> 13:40.287
so it'll be this crazy
novelty and everybody'll

13:40.320 --> 13:41.554
want to see it.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.423
- We could be like
awful child star parents

13:43.456 --> 13:45.425
but a shitty garage band.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.359
- Yes.

13:46.393 --> 13:47.294
So learn the bass already.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.262
- I gotta stir the gravy.

13:50.964 --> 13:53.300
(strumming)

14:00.507 --> 14:02.409
- [Cary] It'll be
fun though, right?

14:02.442 --> 14:05.045
We'll get to tour and stuff.

14:05.078 --> 14:07.414
(strumming)

14:19.526 --> 14:22.362
- [Jean] We should
work on a name.

14:22.395 --> 14:24.397
- I thought of
one the other day.

14:24.431 --> 14:26.099
Jessica Albatross.

14:26.133 --> 14:28.401
(laughing)

14:30.370 --> 14:32.372
- For the baby?

14:32.405 --> 14:33.941
- No, for the band.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.542
- I'm saying we should
work on baby names,

14:35.575 --> 14:37.277
but sure, yeah.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.947
Jessica Albatross, that's a
good name for a little girl.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.148
- Ooo.
(laughing)

14:41.181 --> 14:43.083
I thought of the perfect
one the other day.

14:43.116 --> 14:44.017
Doom Buggy.

14:45.152 --> 14:46.053
- Come on, I wanna
do baby names.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.220
- Oh yeah, boy or girl.

14:47.254 --> 14:48.455
Doom Buggy.

14:48.488 --> 14:49.990
- Right.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.925
What do you think about Olive?

14:51.959 --> 14:54.194
For a girl, obviously?
(people laughing outside)

14:54.227 --> 14:57.097
- Uh, I think those guys
upstairs are throwing

14:57.130 --> 14:58.631
a rager tonight.

14:58.665 --> 14:59.599
- Again?

14:59.632 --> 15:00.367
Fuck.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.634
For New Years?

15:01.668 --> 15:03.436
- Yeah.

15:03.470 --> 15:06.006
Saw 'em lugging a keg upstairs.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.474
- [Jean] Did they
say anything to you?

15:07.507 --> 15:09.042
- No, I never talk
to those dudes.

15:09.076 --> 15:10.243
- You'd think they'd
have the respect

15:10.277 --> 15:13.713
to at least warn us
they're having a party.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.215
Seriously though.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.583
Olive.

15:16.616 --> 15:17.684
It's kind of growing on me.

15:17.717 --> 15:19.386
- I like Magnolia.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.553
- I do, too.

15:20.587 --> 15:21.989
Sucks Kyle and Crystal
took it already.

15:22.022 --> 15:23.356
- Oh.

15:23.390 --> 15:25.058
I had the shittiest
work email today.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.426
- I wonder what
they're doing tonight.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.561
I should say hey to her,
see how she's doing.

15:28.595 --> 15:32.565
- Kyle's probably practicing
his stupid yogi yoga

15:32.599 --> 15:34.001
bullshit or whatever.

15:34.034 --> 15:36.269
He started doing it
on the lunch breaks.

15:36.303 --> 15:37.404
- It's healthy at least.

15:37.437 --> 15:38.471
(laughing)

15:38.505 --> 15:41.541
- He looks like a total doof.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.476
He does it in the break
room and he just lays out

15:43.510 --> 15:45.979
his mat and everything.

15:46.013 --> 15:49.216
- Well if he's
starting to be a yogi.

15:49.249 --> 15:50.450
Jesus, you ate all that cheese?

15:50.483 --> 15:51.618
- [Cary] You helped.

15:51.651 --> 15:53.486
- I hate like a bite.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.722
- Well, it's good.

15:55.755 --> 15:57.590
(laughing)

15:57.624 --> 15:58.458
- Yeah.

16:00.327 --> 16:02.195
But I'm cooking this
nice dinner for us.

16:02.229 --> 16:03.130
- I know, I'm hungry.

16:03.163 --> 16:04.764
- Yeah, are you still hungry?

16:04.797 --> 16:06.733
- I swear I am.

16:06.766 --> 16:09.669
(slow piano music)

16:12.605 --> 16:14.541
- I should've ran and
gotten those canned beets.

16:14.574 --> 16:15.775
- Jesus, I'm sorry
about the beets, okay?

16:15.808 --> 16:18.478
- No, no, it's just,
you've been drinking.

16:18.511 --> 16:20.180
You're probably full
now, so I at least

16:20.213 --> 16:21.748
could've have some
beets if I'm, you know,

16:21.781 --> 16:23.516
the only one enjoying the meal.

16:23.550 --> 16:25.018
- I'm gonna enjoy the meal.

16:25.052 --> 16:26.086
Come on, let's eat.

16:26.119 --> 16:27.120
I'm starved.

16:28.555 --> 16:29.789
- It's not ready yet.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.392
- Okay well then let's
finish this song, then?

16:32.425 --> 16:34.561
- I don't want to
play bass right now.

16:34.594 --> 16:35.662
- You never do,
that's the problem.

16:35.695 --> 16:36.496
- Oh.

16:36.529 --> 16:37.764
That's the problem?

16:37.797 --> 16:41.768
- Jesus, why are you so
pissed all of a sudden?

16:41.801 --> 16:43.603
- Why couldn't you
remember my canned beets?

16:43.636 --> 16:45.805
- God, that's it, I'm
grabbing the goddamn beets.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.407
- No, dinner's almost ready.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.541
- Well, you're obviously
not gonna be satisfied

16:48.575 --> 16:49.742
until I grab 'em.

16:49.776 --> 16:50.677
Let me just grab
'em, I'll be second.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.579
- No, just, it's too late.

16:52.612 --> 16:55.048
You've already forgotten them.

16:55.082 --> 16:56.249
Come on, let's
just we can start--

16:56.283 --> 16:58.551
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.

16:58.585 --> 17:01.621
(slow piano music)

17:03.823 --> 17:06.025
Everything's just crazy.

17:07.660 --> 17:10.630
I'm really hormonal
right now I think.

17:12.132 --> 17:13.300
You're just...

17:16.803 --> 17:19.571
You just run and get the beets.

17:21.241 --> 17:25.345
* I used to believe in the sound

17:27.614 --> 17:29.516
* The sound of the ocean

17:29.549 --> 17:33.720
* An infinite
current to carry us

17:37.857 --> 17:42.229
* Now there's a
silence in the air

17:44.364 --> 17:48.235
* Equally infinite
but utterly desolate

17:48.268 --> 17:50.737
* A desert hush

17:53.306 --> 17:57.477
* I padlocked my own childhood

17:57.510 --> 18:01.614
* And threw it in the abyss

18:01.648 --> 18:05.585
* If someone would
only dive down and

18:05.618 --> 18:07.854
* Recover it

18:10.190 --> 18:11.791
* Break

18:11.824 --> 18:13.826
* Me

18:13.860 --> 18:15.762
* Open

18:27.807 --> 18:29.742
If you wanna head
out tonight, you can.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.311
- Uh no, no way.

18:32.512 --> 18:34.247
I thought we were gonna
spend the night in.

18:34.281 --> 18:35.815
Solidarity, right?

18:35.848 --> 18:37.750
(banging)

18:37.784 --> 18:40.487
- You sure you don't wanna
do some keg stands upstairs?

18:40.520 --> 18:43.190
- Eh, I thought you'd never ask.

18:51.798 --> 18:54.334
(chuckling)

18:56.403 --> 18:57.504
What's going on?

18:57.537 --> 19:00.540
- Oh, no, nothing, just
joking around with Crystal.

19:00.573 --> 19:01.708
- Oh that reminds me.

19:01.741 --> 19:03.410
I haven't told you
about that shitty email.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.512
Mary sent out this
super negative,

19:05.545 --> 19:07.380
shitty email to the
whole staff right before

19:07.414 --> 19:09.516
we went home for New Year's Eve.

19:09.549 --> 19:10.517
Isn't that fucked up?

19:10.550 --> 19:11.751
- What'd it say?

19:11.784 --> 19:12.919
- Well it was pretty
much talking about

19:12.952 --> 19:16.189
that pamphlet I mocked up
for Clifton Medical Supply.

19:16.223 --> 19:18.825
And she's like, "Oh,
don't be creative

19:18.858 --> 19:21.194
"and pretty much do
all the boring stuff

19:21.228 --> 19:23.863
"that the client
wants you to do."

19:25.565 --> 19:28.901
- Well you probably
should do that, huh?

19:28.935 --> 19:30.670
- Well, yeah, but,
like why is it called

19:30.703 --> 19:32.705
creative resources then?

19:33.706 --> 19:35.308
- Cary, it's business writing.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.844
That's just an arbitrary name.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.447
- Why would Kyle lie to me?

19:40.480 --> 19:42.915
He told me that it was
this totally good job

19:42.949 --> 19:45.885
and that it was
super challenging.

19:45.918 --> 19:49.689
All we end up doing is just
writing this super lame

19:49.722 --> 19:51.658
business jargon.

19:51.691 --> 19:52.825
- It is a good job.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.427
Kyle probably
really does like it.

19:54.461 --> 19:55.395
He gets paid well.

19:55.428 --> 19:56.629
- It is really boring.

19:56.663 --> 19:58.998
There's no way he could
fucking like this job.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.367
- Cary,

20:00.400 --> 20:01.501
he has a kid.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.671
It's called growing up.

20:04.704 --> 20:05.605
- [Cary] Fuck that.

20:05.638 --> 20:06.739
I don't ever wanna grow up.

20:06.773 --> 20:08.608
- Right, but don't be like that.

20:08.641 --> 20:10.343
It can't be that bad.

20:10.377 --> 20:11.611
- Yeah?

20:11.644 --> 20:13.413
Well you should try it.

20:13.446 --> 20:14.747
- I did.

20:14.781 --> 20:16.015
Remember?

20:16.048 --> 20:18.885
For over two years
at Chellem-Howell?

20:19.819 --> 20:21.521
- Two years sounds pretty sweet

20:21.554 --> 20:22.755
compared to four fucking--

20:22.789 --> 20:23.890
- Cary, stop.

20:25.958 --> 20:27.327
- You know what?

20:27.360 --> 20:28.728
I'd love just to
stay at home all day

20:28.761 --> 20:31.731
and not go back to my
stupid, boring job.

20:31.764 --> 20:33.466
- Sweetie, it doesn't
work like that.

20:33.500 --> 20:37.003
You have to be making money
if you wanted to stay home.

20:39.806 --> 20:41.608
(groaning)

20:41.641 --> 20:43.310
Kyle and Crystal wanna stop by.

20:43.343 --> 20:44.611
- No fuckin' way.

20:44.644 --> 20:45.578
No, no, no.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.414
- What am I supposed to say

20:47.447 --> 20:48.047
if they know we're
just sitting around

20:48.080 --> 20:49.015
at home all night?

20:49.048 --> 20:50.750
- I don't know, say anything.

20:50.783 --> 20:51.851
Say that we're watching a
fucking movie or something,

20:51.884 --> 20:52.952
I don't know.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.790
- They wanna bring
Magnolia over.

20:57.824 --> 20:59.659
We've only seen
her that one time

20:59.692 --> 21:01.761
after she got home
from the hospital.

21:01.794 --> 21:02.929
- Fuck.

21:02.962 --> 21:04.997
This night couldn't
get any worse.

21:05.031 --> 21:05.865
- Hey.

21:06.933 --> 21:07.800
Thanks.

21:07.834 --> 21:08.635
Thanks a lot.

21:08.668 --> 21:09.869
- No, I don't mean.

21:09.902 --> 21:12.839
I don't mean you, I just mean
all this fighting, it sucks.

21:12.872 --> 21:15.542
- Okay, well, why don't we stop?

21:19.779 --> 21:20.613
Can we?

21:21.714 --> 21:25.885
- Sure whatever, I can.
(chuckling)

21:25.918 --> 21:26.753
- Such a--

21:27.720 --> 21:29.055
Oh, I nearly forgot.

21:29.088 --> 21:30.690
I got us an ice cream cake.

21:30.723 --> 21:32.091
You want a piece?

21:32.124 --> 21:33.826
- No, babe, I'm stuffed.

21:33.860 --> 21:34.794
- Come on, you have
to start working

21:34.827 --> 21:35.862
on your sympathy weight.

21:35.895 --> 21:37.764
- No, seriously,
I'm over-stuffed.

21:37.797 --> 21:38.865
I'm stuffed.

21:38.898 --> 21:39.899
- [Jean] It's all that
goddamn cheese and crackers

21:39.932 --> 21:40.800
you wolfed down.

21:40.833 --> 21:41.834
- You know what?

21:41.868 --> 21:43.603
I'm famished.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.572
Come here, serve it up.

21:57.049 --> 21:59.486
(laughing)

22:00.387 --> 22:00.987
- Hey.

22:02.455 --> 22:03.089
I'm sorry.

22:04.023 --> 22:05.892
- Oh, me too.

22:05.925 --> 22:06.959
- No, but,

22:07.960 --> 22:10.863
I'm sorry about last night.

22:10.897 --> 22:13.032
Especially about last night.

22:15.535 --> 22:18.004
- Forget it, you didn't mean it.

22:19.606 --> 22:21.808
- I had this plan to make you
this nice dinner and stuff

22:21.841 --> 22:23.976
and make it up to you, but,

22:24.010 --> 22:26.879
your mom stopped by and
shit all over everything.

22:26.913 --> 22:29.115
- What happened to
the "And stuff?"

22:29.148 --> 22:31.618
(laughing)

22:36.122 --> 22:38.558
- I know you hate your job.

22:39.959 --> 22:42.662
But we just have to start
making sacrifices, right?

22:42.695 --> 22:43.530
- I guess.

22:44.464 --> 22:45.097
- Cary?

22:46.666 --> 22:47.734
- No, I know.

22:48.901 --> 22:51.438
I'm just worried about the
Burning Daylights, you know?

22:51.471 --> 22:54.774
Or wondering if we're
ever gonna tour again.

22:54.807 --> 22:58.811
- Well, you guys never
really toured anyway, so,

22:58.845 --> 22:59.646
why does it matter?

22:59.679 --> 23:00.913
- Yeah, we did.

23:00.947 --> 23:02.815
We went that one time
to New York for a week

23:02.849 --> 23:05.885
(phone pinging)
and back.

23:05.918 --> 23:06.853
- Oh, yeah.

23:07.887 --> 23:10.089
(clearing throat)

23:10.122 --> 23:12.124
Uh, they're coming over.

23:15.862 --> 23:18.130
- God, really?
- Yeah.

23:18.164 --> 23:19.499
- I told them we
were watching a movie

23:19.532 --> 23:20.967
and they said
they'd just pop in.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.001
- God.

23:22.034 --> 23:24.471
Take a hint, Dingles.
- Yeah.

23:26.038 --> 23:29.542
(slow acoustic music)

23:29.576 --> 23:30.877
- Okay.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.211
I'm gonna go get some beer then.

23:32.244 --> 23:35.081
Alright, it'll
just take a second.

23:37.183 --> 23:39.051
(slow acoustic music)

23:39.085 --> 23:43.590
* You be the deer,
I'll float in the trees

23:43.623 --> 23:47.927
* Hide and seek, hide and seek

23:47.960 --> 23:52.699
* I'll be the snake
down in the weeds

23:52.732 --> 23:57.203
* Hide and seek, hide and seek

23:57.236 --> 24:01.908
* There's no beginning,
there's no end

24:01.941 --> 24:05.612
* Only a need to comprehend

24:06.579 --> 24:10.016
* What we're all missing

24:10.049 --> 24:13.553
* Hide and seek

24:13.586 --> 24:16.055
* Hide and seek

24:21.060 --> 24:24.564
(acoustic pop rock music)

24:45.985 --> 24:50.156
(soft rock music)
(people chattering)

24:56.195 --> 24:57.029
Hey.

24:59.198 --> 25:01.067
I don't think these
hipsters appreciate

25:01.100 --> 25:03.903
your nice decorations.

25:03.936 --> 25:07.006
- Well if they're hipsters
then what are you?

25:07.039 --> 25:09.208
- We met before, remember?

25:10.977 --> 25:13.913
Well I will have
a shot of whiskey.

25:17.016 --> 25:17.850
Hey, I'm,

25:19.085 --> 25:21.020
I'm a parent.

25:21.053 --> 25:22.121
- Yeah.

25:22.154 --> 25:23.756
So be extremely apparent.

25:23.790 --> 25:25.124
- No, I mean (laughing)

25:25.157 --> 25:27.760
I mean, like I'm a dad.

25:27.794 --> 25:29.195
I'm gonna be a dad.

25:30.863 --> 25:35.101
So, I'm not like all these
hipsters running around.

25:35.134 --> 25:36.068
- Congratulations.

25:36.102 --> 25:37.870
- Hey, I'm gonna take
it from here, okay?

25:37.904 --> 25:38.738
Shoo.

25:40.807 --> 25:42.174
How's New Years
going for you so far?

25:42.208 --> 25:44.076
- Oh, it's alright,
man, how's yours?

25:44.110 --> 25:47.046
- Beautiful, but
it's about to get

25:47.079 --> 25:48.314
this much better.

25:50.282 --> 25:51.918
Alright, what's this to?

25:51.951 --> 25:52.785
To, uh,

25:53.753 --> 25:55.221
to another shitfaced year.

25:55.254 --> 25:56.255
- I hope so.

26:00.159 --> 26:01.193
- Woo, okay.

26:01.227 --> 26:02.595
I'm gonna go restock some shit.

26:02.629 --> 26:03.796
Are you gonna be around?

26:03.830 --> 26:05.064
- Sure.

26:05.097 --> 26:05.732
- Okay, great, I'll
see you in a second.

26:05.765 --> 26:06.132
- Alright.

26:08.100 --> 26:11.137
(soft rock music)

26:15.775 --> 26:19.946
(soft rock music)
(people chattering)

26:36.228 --> 26:37.063
- Oh hey, do you want a bump?

26:37.096 --> 26:38.130
- Huh?

26:38.164 --> 26:39.098
Oh.

26:39.131 --> 26:40.166
Yeah, sure, why not?

26:40.199 --> 26:41.768
- Great.

26:41.801 --> 26:43.169
So, are you hanging
around tonight then?

26:43.202 --> 26:44.704
- Oh man, I wish.

26:44.737 --> 26:46.906
No I just, I came
by for a six pack.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.140
- Oh fuck man, that sucks.

26:48.174 --> 26:52.311
Well, I am gonna get
you nice and lit for

26:52.344 --> 26:55.214
game night or whatever
it is you're doin'.

26:55.247 --> 26:57.249
- Fucking hanging out
with Kyle and his wife

26:57.283 --> 26:58.651
is apparently what I'm doing.

26:58.685 --> 27:00.820
- Oh shit, man,
that's gonna be fun.

27:00.853 --> 27:02.188
- Yeah.

27:02.221 --> 27:03.022
I guess.

27:03.055 --> 27:04.256
Not likely, though.

27:04.290 --> 27:05.091
- Dude, what's the deal?

27:05.124 --> 27:06.726
I thought that you
and him had like

27:06.759 --> 27:08.160
a super awesome
bromance going on?

27:08.194 --> 27:09.228
(laughing)

27:09.261 --> 27:10.763
- I, I guess, man.

27:12.131 --> 27:14.133
Things were a lot cooler,
though, when we were

27:14.166 --> 27:15.968
focusing on the band and stuff.

27:16.002 --> 27:17.136
- But you know what, man?

27:17.169 --> 27:20.206
This is, like, the
fucking time, dude,

27:20.239 --> 27:22.875
where like, you're
fucking having babies.

27:22.909 --> 27:24.410
You're like, settling down,

27:24.443 --> 27:26.112
becoming old together.

27:26.145 --> 27:28.180
This is the time where you
just kind of hang it up.

27:28.214 --> 27:29.448
You know, you call it a day.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.117
- It's bullshit,
though, man, you know?

27:31.150 --> 27:32.384
I mean, you wouldn't
stop playing just because

27:32.418 --> 27:34.721
you were having
kids or whatever.

27:34.754 --> 27:35.955
- I don't know, man.

27:35.988 --> 27:37.356
You gotta grow up
sometime, you know?

27:37.389 --> 27:39.658
(sniffing)

27:43.730 --> 27:45.998
(sniffing)

27:47.366 --> 27:50.803
(slow, tinkling music)

28:07.954 --> 28:09.822
- [Bobby] Alright man,
it's time for me to just,

28:09.856 --> 28:11.457
hop back into the fray.

28:11.490 --> 28:12.324
- Yeah, and hey, man.

28:12.358 --> 28:14.326
Can I get that six pack?

28:14.360 --> 28:15.261
IPA or whatever.

28:15.294 --> 28:17.329
- Oh yeah, but, this
is for Kyle, right?

28:17.363 --> 28:18.164
- [Cary] Yeah.

28:18.197 --> 28:20.199
- And he is gluten free.

28:22.268 --> 28:26.305
And we are completely
out of gluten free, dude.

28:26.338 --> 28:27.139
- Ah, fuck.

28:27.173 --> 28:28.140
Alright, that's cool.

28:28.174 --> 28:29.241
Thanks, man.

28:29.275 --> 28:31.077
Hey, you mind if I just
chill back here for a bit?

28:31.110 --> 28:32.178
- Nah, it's all good.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.246
Can you just clean up a
little bit after yourself?

28:34.280 --> 28:35.748
- Yeah, I can.

28:35.782 --> 28:39.051
- [Bobby] Alright, see you man.

28:39.085 --> 28:42.354
(slow, tinkling music)

28:58.370 --> 29:01.240
* Holdin' out

29:01.273 --> 29:03.042
* You're holding out

29:03.075 --> 29:07.346
* So who are you waiting for

29:07.379 --> 29:11.750
* Do you really think another
love will fill the hole

29:14.954 --> 29:19.125
* Your sorrow is a curse
that keeps you holding out

29:21.460 --> 29:25.832
* Stop holding out when
you should be grabbing hold

29:38.210 --> 29:39.278
- Hi, you guys.

29:39.311 --> 29:41.213
- [Crystal] Hey, hello.

29:42.481 --> 29:45.184
- Oh, look at the
little inch worm.

29:45.217 --> 29:48.955
Ooo, look at that hand.
(laughing)

29:48.988 --> 29:50.389
Oh, come in.

29:50.422 --> 29:52.925
- Oh, your place is so adorable.

29:52.959 --> 29:54.126
Oh, I love your tree.

29:54.160 --> 29:54.994
- [Jean] Have you
guys been here before?

29:55.027 --> 29:56.195
- No, I guess not.

29:56.228 --> 29:57.063
- Oh wow.

29:58.264 --> 30:00.399
Cary will be back
in just a minute.

30:00.432 --> 30:02.334
And you remember Pearl.

30:02.368 --> 30:04.270
Um, he just went out
to get some beer.

30:04.303 --> 30:05.872
- Oh, he didn't have to do that.

30:05.905 --> 30:07.573
- [Jean] Oh, well.

30:07.606 --> 30:09.408
I'm not sure what's
taking him so long.

30:09.441 --> 30:11.410
And I don't think
it's just for you, so.

30:11.443 --> 30:13.612
- Well in that case, I think
he did have to do that.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.014
(laughing)

30:15.047 --> 30:16.215
- I brought dessert,
it's cherry pie.

30:16.248 --> 30:16.883
- Oh, oh.

30:17.950 --> 30:21.287
* I got a fever I can't shake

30:21.320 --> 30:25.424
* I got a sickness
I ain't gonna quit

30:25.457 --> 30:29.161
* I'm on a streak
that I can't break

30:29.195 --> 30:32.865
* Lighting the wick
of each relationship

30:32.899 --> 30:36.568
* Boy, I got a
secret to tell you

30:36.602 --> 30:40.372
* It's never as hard as
you're makin' it seem

30:40.406 --> 30:44.476
* Yeah, I got a
secret to tell you

30:44.510 --> 30:48.414
* You're out of truth
'cause you wanna be

30:48.447 --> 30:52.251
* I'm bustin' out of this coffin

30:52.284 --> 30:55.988
* I'm gonna run my
own bones in the dirt

30:56.022 --> 30:59.658
* Color the road
with my skeletons

30:59.691 --> 31:03.429
* Hastily hid and
they never stay put

31:03.462 --> 31:07.433
* Boy, I got a
secret to tell you

31:07.466 --> 31:11.303
* Nobody's ransacking
your dresser drawers

31:11.337 --> 31:14.974
* I got a secret to tell you

31:15.007 --> 31:19.178
* You're not even sure
what they're hiding for

31:20.980 --> 31:22.481
I have been sipping on this.

31:22.514 --> 31:24.416
I opened it last weekend,
but it still tastes okay.

31:24.450 --> 31:25.351
- Sure.

31:25.384 --> 31:26.552
I'll have a sip of the old wine.

31:26.585 --> 31:27.686
You're supposed to
let it age, right?

31:27.719 --> 31:29.188
- That's right.

31:30.089 --> 31:30.990
And you're okay?

31:31.023 --> 31:32.358
- Yeah, water's totally fine.

31:32.391 --> 31:34.393
I'm breast feeding so
I can't have any booze.

31:34.426 --> 31:35.461
Boo hoo.

31:36.395 --> 31:37.296
- Oh.

31:37.329 --> 31:39.365
Ooo, she is such a darling.

31:39.398 --> 31:41.367
- Oh, thank you.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.970
So, a baby on the
way, and a wedding.

31:44.003 --> 31:45.037
You must have your hands full.

31:45.071 --> 31:46.438
- Yeah, yeah.

31:46.472 --> 31:50.042
Oh well, I mean, nothing
like you guys, I'm sure.

31:50.076 --> 31:51.443
- Remind me of the date again.

31:51.477 --> 31:52.711
- Um.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.413
Funny you should mention that.

31:54.446 --> 31:58.517
It was August 27th and now
I'm not sure what's going on.

31:58.550 --> 31:59.551
- What?

31:59.585 --> 32:00.352
What do you mean?

32:00.386 --> 32:01.553
Is everything okay?

32:01.587 --> 32:04.190
- Oh yeah, no, it's
just Cary's mom.

32:05.224 --> 32:06.525
- Oh boy.

32:06.558 --> 32:08.194
What's she done now?

32:08.227 --> 32:09.561
- It's nothing really.

32:09.595 --> 32:12.464
She just stopped by
tonight with some

32:12.498 --> 32:15.567
cockamamie story about
this cruise she has to take

32:15.601 --> 32:16.702
that weekend or something.

32:16.735 --> 32:19.038
- That sounds about right.

32:19.071 --> 32:19.671
- I don't get it.

32:19.705 --> 32:21.573
Is she, like?

32:21.607 --> 32:23.109
- A kook.

32:23.142 --> 32:25.011
- To put it lightly.

32:25.044 --> 32:26.512
I'm sure you understand
why Cary is the way

32:26.545 --> 32:27.713
he is now, huh?

32:27.746 --> 32:29.481
- Yeah, well, yeah.

32:29.515 --> 32:31.750
She's not all that bad.

32:31.783 --> 32:35.487
I think she just sort of
lives in her own orbit.

32:35.521 --> 32:38.490
- Says the soon-to-be
daughter-in-law.

32:38.524 --> 32:40.026
(laughing)

32:40.059 --> 32:41.293
- I can't remember.

32:41.327 --> 32:43.295
How long have you
two been together?

32:43.329 --> 32:45.131
- Um, six years.

32:45.164 --> 32:46.065
- Wow.

32:46.098 --> 32:47.299
Just getting married now?

32:47.333 --> 32:50.336
I mean, not that
that's a bad thing.

32:52.504 --> 32:55.274
- Actually, I think
certain circumstances

32:55.307 --> 32:57.576
fast tracked the decision.

32:57.609 --> 32:59.611
- Well I could see us all
hanging out a lot more

32:59.645 --> 33:00.579
once we all have kids.

33:00.612 --> 33:01.613
I mean, wouldn't that be fun?

33:01.647 --> 33:02.481
- Yeah.

33:02.514 --> 33:04.716
Yeah, I would love that.
- It'll be fun.

33:04.750 --> 33:06.518
- Yeah, it's so hard now.

33:06.552 --> 33:08.254
With everyone being
so busy anymore.

33:08.287 --> 33:10.756
- And trying to pin Cary down
for more than five minutes.

33:10.789 --> 33:13.559
You know, I swear,
I never see anymore.

33:13.592 --> 33:16.128
Except for slaving away
in his cubicle at work.

33:16.162 --> 33:19.565
- You know, he told me about
that email that Mary sent?

33:19.598 --> 33:20.666
That sounds kind of brutal.

33:20.699 --> 33:21.533
- Brutal?

33:21.567 --> 33:22.801
Hardly.

33:22.834 --> 33:25.137
He never follows any of
the company guidelines.

33:25.171 --> 33:27.206
He doesn't even follow any
of the notes that his clients

33:27.239 --> 33:28.507
give him.

33:28.540 --> 33:30.309
Basically the tell
him to do one thing,

33:30.342 --> 33:32.478
and he does something
entirely different.

33:32.511 --> 33:33.312
- But do you really
think it was necessary

33:33.345 --> 33:35.681
to reprimand him
on a group email?

33:35.714 --> 33:37.116
- Trust me.

33:37.149 --> 33:39.485
She has reprimanded
him plenty in person.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.653
I think this is like,
her latest effort to try

33:41.687 --> 33:43.522
to get through to him.

33:44.656 --> 33:46.058
Okay.

33:46.092 --> 33:47.659
It's not like he's gonna
get fired or anything.

33:47.693 --> 33:50.529
He is a really good
writer, it's just,

33:50.562 --> 33:52.564
well, you know, he's Cary.

33:52.598 --> 33:55.767
He likes to do
things his own way.

33:55.801 --> 33:59.505
- Wow, I didn't realize
he was so difficult.

33:59.538 --> 34:00.706
(laughing)

34:00.739 --> 34:04.243
- You didn't realize that
Cary Lonegan was so difficult?

34:04.276 --> 34:05.311
- Honey.

34:05.344 --> 34:06.678
- No, no, no, no, that's okay.

34:06.712 --> 34:09.148
Of course I know how Cary is.

34:09.848 --> 34:12.217
That's why I love him.

34:12.251 --> 34:13.418
- Yeah, he's awesome.
- Yeah.

34:13.452 --> 34:17.556
I just didn't, yeah, I just
didn't realize he was having

34:17.589 --> 34:18.623
such a hard time at work.

34:18.657 --> 34:20.859
- Well, he's a
really good writer.

34:20.891 --> 34:22.694
It's just,

34:22.728 --> 34:24.763
well, like you said.

34:24.795 --> 34:25.630
He's Cary.

34:27.132 --> 34:29.168
And that's why we love him.

34:33.239 --> 34:37.309
(soft acoustic orchestral music)

35:03.669 --> 35:04.703
- Hey.

35:05.671 --> 35:06.505
Come here.

35:07.706 --> 35:08.774
Yeah, you.

35:08.807 --> 35:10.509
Come here.

35:10.542 --> 35:12.311
- Can I help you?

35:12.344 --> 35:13.312
- What's up, man?

35:13.345 --> 35:15.247
You partying tonight?

35:15.281 --> 35:16.715
- Yeah, kind of.

35:16.748 --> 35:17.649
- Kind of?

35:17.683 --> 35:19.385
How is that going?

35:20.386 --> 35:22.154
- Well, I mean, I am.

35:22.188 --> 35:24.256
But the dudes I'm
with aren't really.

35:24.290 --> 35:26.858
- She wants to ask if
you'll buy us a 12 pack.

35:26.892 --> 35:29.295
- [Cary] Of soda?

35:29.328 --> 35:32.798
- Yes, one 12 pack of vanilla
cream soda, please sir?

35:32.831 --> 35:34.900
- I am not gonna get busted
for your little antics.

35:34.933 --> 35:36.935
Don't you have an older brother

35:36.968 --> 35:38.370
or a cousin?

35:38.404 --> 35:39.705
- My brother's a
total dick licker.

35:39.738 --> 35:40.639
- Come on, dude.

35:40.672 --> 35:42.241
We're like totally cool chicks.

35:42.274 --> 35:44.376
And we're practically
21 anyways.

35:44.410 --> 35:45.544
- Aw, yeah, and
what's the law got to

35:45.577 --> 35:46.812
do with it anyway, right?

35:46.845 --> 35:47.679
- Exactly.

35:49.348 --> 35:51.583
They should make IDs cards
that say "Practically 21."

35:51.617 --> 35:53.185
- I tell you what, why
don't you show me your ID

35:53.219 --> 35:56.355
that says you're practically
21 and I'll go ahead

35:56.388 --> 35:58.857
and buy that vanilla cream soda.

36:01.293 --> 36:02.961
- Where is it?

36:02.994 --> 36:05.897
Fuck, I can't find it anywhere.

36:05.931 --> 36:07.733
I got this, though.

36:10.302 --> 36:11.637
Practically $21.

36:14.773 --> 36:15.807
Please?

36:16.675 --> 36:17.709
Ugh.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.529
- Disemboweled Vagina?

36:38.730 --> 36:39.965
- Work out music.

36:44.336 --> 36:45.837
(drum roll)

36:45.871 --> 36:46.672
- [Shawna] Is that for us?

36:46.705 --> 36:48.774
- Yeah, this one.

36:48.807 --> 36:50.008
I don't really know
what to do next.

36:50.041 --> 36:52.711
Feels like doing
a drug deal here.

36:54.380 --> 36:56.282
- Do you wanna hop in your
car for a sec and have a beer?

36:56.315 --> 36:57.849
- Uh yeah, let's go.

36:57.883 --> 36:58.717
- Okay.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.293
Who you sextin'?

37:07.326 --> 37:08.760
- Uh, huh?

37:08.794 --> 37:10.296
Oh, no one.

37:10.329 --> 37:11.430
Home.

37:11.463 --> 37:12.664
- Who's home?

37:12.698 --> 37:15.033
I mean, god, we're in
a strange man's car

37:15.066 --> 37:17.803
and we don't know a
single thing about him?

37:17.836 --> 37:19.004
What if he's a homicidal rapist?

37:19.037 --> 37:20.639
- Not funny.

37:20.672 --> 37:22.574
- You're not a homicidal
rapist, are you?

37:22.608 --> 37:23.609
- I'm Cary.

37:23.642 --> 37:24.843
- See?

37:24.876 --> 37:26.445
He's Cary, he's not a
homicidal rapist at all.

37:26.478 --> 37:28.480
- [Tracy] Scary Cary.

37:28.514 --> 37:31.350
- She's all bent out of shape
'cause her boyfriend's gay.

37:31.383 --> 37:32.884
- Oh, how does that work?

37:32.918 --> 37:35.987
- It doesn't, Scary
Cary, it doesn't.

37:39.891 --> 37:41.293
I'm Shawna.

37:41.327 --> 37:42.794
Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

37:42.828 --> 37:45.664
And this barrel of laughs
behind me is Tracy.

37:45.697 --> 37:46.965
- Oh, I,

37:46.998 --> 37:48.934
I used to have a
cat named Tracy.

37:48.967 --> 37:51.537
- So glad you're
not gonna rape us.

37:51.570 --> 37:52.438
- Who's back at home?

37:52.471 --> 37:53.305
A lady?

37:54.740 --> 37:57.743
- Oh yeah, um, it's just,
um, someone I live with.

37:57.776 --> 37:58.910
- Is she like your room mate

37:58.944 --> 38:00.312
or are you guys like a thing?

38:00.346 --> 38:01.813
- Yeah, you could
say that, I guess.

38:01.847 --> 38:02.648
- Say what?

38:02.681 --> 38:04.616
That you're a room
mate or a thing?

38:04.650 --> 38:06.051
- Um, both.

38:06.084 --> 38:08.620
I mean, you know,
she's my room mate

38:08.654 --> 38:11.457
and we're like, together.

38:11.490 --> 38:13.659
- Sounds pretty hot and heavy.

38:13.692 --> 38:16.995
- Actually it's kind
of hot and cold.

38:17.028 --> 38:19.030
Uh, what do you guys do?

38:22.033 --> 38:23.469
- We're at the Art Institute.

38:23.502 --> 38:24.470
We moved here from Kentucky.

38:24.503 --> 38:26.405
It's pretty awesome here.

38:26.438 --> 38:27.939
Are you from here?

38:29.074 --> 38:29.908
- Yeah.

38:30.842 --> 38:32.978
Yeah, the suburbs.

38:33.011 --> 38:33.979
- We live in the dorms.

38:34.012 --> 38:34.846
It sucks.

38:35.981 --> 38:36.815
- Yeah?

38:36.848 --> 38:38.384
What are you guys
doing way up here?

38:38.417 --> 38:39.751
- Oh this is our
favorite liquor store

38:39.785 --> 38:40.886
to pick up strange men.

38:40.919 --> 38:44.089
- Ah, I guess you're doing
a bang up job then, right?

38:44.122 --> 38:46.124
- We're going to some dumb
party Tracy's gay boyfriend

38:46.157 --> 38:47.593
told us about.

38:47.626 --> 38:48.960
We're going so we can
hold hands at midnight

38:48.994 --> 38:49.795
and talk about shoes--

38:49.828 --> 38:51.363
- He's not gay.

38:51.397 --> 38:52.598
I wish he was gay, though.

38:52.631 --> 38:54.733
I wish we were both gay dudes.

38:54.766 --> 38:57.669
- You'd get a lot more action.

38:57.703 --> 38:58.704
How about you?

38:58.737 --> 39:00.972
Do you get a lot of action
from your room mate?

39:01.006 --> 39:03.008
- I can't believe we're
still talking about this.

39:03.041 --> 39:04.543
- Oh, come on.

39:04.576 --> 39:06.712
Stop being so
sexually buttoned up.

39:06.745 --> 39:07.913
That's the problem
with this country.

39:07.946 --> 39:09.848
So freaking provincial.

39:11.049 --> 39:13.552
When did you guys meet?

39:13.585 --> 39:15.521
- Oh well, a while ago.

39:15.554 --> 39:16.822
A while.

39:16.855 --> 39:18.990
- Ooo, so you probably
don't get a lot of action

39:19.024 --> 39:20.992
at all anymore, huh?

39:21.026 --> 39:22.728
Sensitive subject.

39:24.863 --> 39:25.897
Um.

39:25.931 --> 39:27.499
How did you guys meet?

39:27.533 --> 39:29.968
Was it love at first sight?
- God, 20 questions.

39:30.001 --> 39:31.537
- Um.

39:31.570 --> 39:33.572
Oh, not exactly, I mean.

39:34.740 --> 39:36.141
You know, it was
actually business.

39:36.174 --> 39:37.843
She did the PR for my band.

39:37.876 --> 39:39.411
- You're in a band?

39:39.445 --> 39:40.912
What band?

39:40.946 --> 39:41.780
- Uh, yeah.

39:41.813 --> 39:42.914
The Burning Daylights.

39:42.948 --> 39:43.849
- Hm, never heard of them.

39:43.882 --> 39:45.617
My boyfriend's in
the band Cleanliness.

39:45.651 --> 39:46.818
You ever play with them?

39:46.852 --> 39:47.886
- Never heard of 'em.

39:47.919 --> 39:49.020
- Really?

39:49.054 --> 39:49.955
Oh god, they're like blowing up.

39:49.988 --> 39:50.922
You should totally go see 'em.

39:50.956 --> 39:54.826
- Yeah, I guess I'm a
little out of the loop.

39:56.628 --> 39:58.930
- The Burning Daylights, huh?

39:58.964 --> 40:00.131
When do you guys play next?

40:00.165 --> 40:01.533
- Oh, we haven't
booked anything yet.

40:01.567 --> 40:03.001
I mean, but, we
probably will soon.

40:03.034 --> 40:04.936
- Sweet, I wanna
come see you play.

40:04.970 --> 40:05.804
- Yeah?

40:06.938 --> 40:10.408
(slow, tinkling music)

40:15.747 --> 40:18.750
- [Tracy] He's
there, can we go now?

40:21.953 --> 40:23.722
- Hey, Scary Cary?

40:23.755 --> 40:27.759
Do you mind taking us to
this dumb little party?

40:30.095 --> 40:32.230
- He said he was coming back.

40:32.263 --> 40:34.533
No idea what's
taking him so long.

40:34.566 --> 40:35.867
- He really didn't
have to bother with

40:35.901 --> 40:37.235
gluten-free anything.

40:37.268 --> 40:40.138
This wine is totally fine.

40:40.171 --> 40:42.741
- Maybe we should
dig into that pie.

40:42.774 --> 40:43.909
- Yes.

40:43.942 --> 40:45.977
Yes, let's do it.

40:46.011 --> 40:47.012
Hey, forget Cary.

40:47.045 --> 40:48.647
More for us, right?

40:53.752 --> 40:55.554
- [Crystal] Oh, your
kitchen is so cute.

40:55.587 --> 40:57.022
- [Jean] Oh, thanks.

40:57.055 --> 40:59.090
- Yeah, Kyle and I
just redecorated.

40:59.124 --> 41:00.125
Stressful.

41:02.994 --> 41:04.262
Oh here, let me dish that up.

41:04.295 --> 41:07.032
It's a little bit runny.

41:07.065 --> 41:08.667
Should taste good.

41:08.700 --> 41:09.535
Thank you.

41:13.905 --> 41:14.840
Oh, thanks.

41:21.980 --> 41:23.549
- [Jean] I'm so
sorry about Cary.

41:23.582 --> 41:25.684
He can be so
inconsiderate sometimes.

41:25.717 --> 41:26.918
- Oh, that's alright.

41:26.952 --> 41:28.620
He's just trying to
be helpful, I'm sure.

41:28.654 --> 41:30.021
- [Jean] Um.

41:30.055 --> 41:32.090
Yeah, thanks, but,

41:32.123 --> 41:33.692
no, he's not.

41:33.725 --> 41:34.693
I'm sure.

41:34.726 --> 41:35.627
- What's up?

41:35.661 --> 41:37.028
Is everything okay with you two?

41:37.062 --> 41:38.096
- Uh yeah.

41:38.964 --> 41:40.131
It's fine, you know.

41:40.165 --> 41:41.600
Just

41:41.633 --> 41:44.069
ups and downs, but it's fine.

41:45.070 --> 41:46.972
- I'm really glad we
came over tonight.

41:47.005 --> 41:49.541
We don't get to see each
other that much, you know?

41:49.575 --> 41:53.178
- Yeah, yeah, it's good
to see you guys, too.

41:53.211 --> 41:54.980
It's so nice to--

41:55.013 --> 41:59.117
- I know we don't know
each other that well, but,

42:00.051 --> 42:01.887
I really like you, Jean.

42:01.920 --> 42:04.055
So, you know, if there's
anything that you

42:04.089 --> 42:05.223
wanna get off your chest that--

42:05.256 --> 42:07.793
- I don't know what's
happening to us.

42:07.826 --> 42:12.297
(sobbing)
- Hon, what's going on?

42:12.330 --> 42:14.700
(sobbing)

42:17.736 --> 42:19.104
- He just gets so
distant, alright?

42:19.137 --> 42:22.140
Disappears all together
like right now.

42:22.173 --> 42:24.109
It's like he keeps up this
facade but there's just,

42:24.142 --> 42:26.845
there's nobody behind it.

42:26.878 --> 42:28.179
- That's just guys, you know?

42:28.213 --> 42:29.047
They--

42:30.215 --> 42:34.586
(sobbing)
(slow music)

42:37.956 --> 42:41.159
- For all I know, we don't
even have a wedding date set.

42:41.192 --> 42:43.161
- [Crystal] You do...

42:43.194 --> 42:47.666
(soft music drowns out speaker)

42:47.699 --> 42:49.701
* Hello

42:53.171 --> 42:55.173
* Hello

42:59.077 --> 43:01.012
* Hello

43:04.415 --> 43:06.618
* Hello

43:19.164 --> 43:21.066
- He's such a child.

43:21.099 --> 43:23.101
Total arrested development.

43:23.134 --> 43:25.136
All 'cause of his mom.

43:25.170 --> 43:28.039
Unless there's some
other traumatic event

43:28.073 --> 43:30.241
I don't know about.
(laughing)

43:30.275 --> 43:31.843
Just being around her
is traumatic enough

43:31.877 --> 43:33.044
to fuck anybody
up for a lifetime.

43:33.078 --> 43:34.245
(laughing)

43:34.279 --> 43:38.149
- Yeah, Kyle told me
a little about her.

43:38.183 --> 43:40.351
- And I have been
saying such awful things

43:40.385 --> 43:44.656
to him lately and it's
like he doesn't even care.

43:45.991 --> 43:49.695
I called him a selfish,
spoiled brat right to his face.

43:49.728 --> 43:52.230
God, it made me feel like a
child calling names like that.

43:52.263 --> 43:54.165
No, but that's what
he reduces you to.

43:54.199 --> 43:57.168
Just last night, we
had this epic fight,

43:57.202 --> 44:00.005
which has been happening
more and more lately.

44:00.038 --> 44:02.107
I keep blaming my
hormones, but anymore,

44:02.140 --> 44:03.174
I'm not even sure--
- Oh gosh.

44:03.208 --> 44:05.243
It's not your hormones.

44:05.276 --> 44:08.213
Even if it was, I
hate that excuse.

44:08.246 --> 44:09.447
- Ugh, I know.

44:09.480 --> 44:12.050
I hate that I even offer
it as an excuse, but,

44:12.083 --> 44:15.053
so, last night, we're
arguing about houses.

44:15.086 --> 44:16.187
We're gonna buy a house.

44:16.221 --> 44:17.889
- Exciting.

44:17.923 --> 44:20.058
- Yeah, yeah, I guess.

44:20.091 --> 44:22.127
But he's fighting it
every step of the way.

44:22.160 --> 44:23.762
Apparently he'd be
happy renting this dump

44:23.795 --> 44:25.163
for the rest of his
life despite us hardly

44:25.196 --> 44:27.866
fitting into it
even without a baby.

44:27.899 --> 44:30.101
And when I exposed
the fact that he is,

44:30.135 --> 44:33.038
he is too scared to be
bogged down by a mortgage,

44:33.071 --> 44:35.273
he just sort of
shrugged like, "Yeah.

44:35.306 --> 44:36.842
"Yeah, so what?"

44:38.009 --> 44:39.745
So, I decided to
test him a little

44:39.778 --> 44:43.815
and I was like, "Well, why
don't I just buy a house?

44:43.849 --> 44:47.352
"And you can just pay
me rent, like a tenant."

44:47.385 --> 44:51.256
To which he actually
sat there, considering.

44:52.223 --> 44:53.224
Considering.

44:54.192 --> 44:55.927
So I really laid in on him.

44:55.961 --> 44:58.797
Called him a shitty, washed
up, never was musician

44:58.830 --> 44:59.965
who could just move
back into his mother's

44:59.998 --> 45:01.399
basement for all I cared.

45:01.432 --> 45:04.269
(door opening)

45:04.302 --> 45:07.338
(soft rock music)

45:15.246 --> 45:17.115
I know it was harsh.

45:19.017 --> 45:21.186
I was way out of line.

45:21.219 --> 45:23.121
But do you know how
difficult it is to discuss

45:23.154 --> 45:26.257
the future, your
own child's future,

45:26.291 --> 45:27.492
with someone who
doesn't give two shits

45:27.525 --> 45:29.094
about anything
other than himself?

45:29.127 --> 45:31.062
- Oh come on, he's not that bad.

45:31.096 --> 45:31.930
I mean,

45:31.963 --> 45:33.999
he loves you, he just,

45:34.032 --> 45:36.301
some people have a
hard time showing it.

45:36.334 --> 45:38.970
- Yeah, a real hard time.

45:39.004 --> 45:42.007
Wait, you wanna know what
the worst part of it was?

45:42.040 --> 45:45.310
- I said all that
awful stuff to him,

45:45.343 --> 45:49.080
and he just looked
at me with this

45:49.114 --> 45:51.416
like, totally blank expression

45:52.317 --> 45:54.853
and just left the room.

45:54.886 --> 45:57.288
And then this
morning he gets up,

45:57.322 --> 45:58.523
goes to work with
a smile on his face

45:58.556 --> 46:00.325
like nothing ever happened.

46:00.358 --> 46:04.963
It's like he still carries
this power over me,

46:04.996 --> 46:08.033
this authority, like he
knows something I don't.

46:08.066 --> 46:09.234
- Hm.

46:09.267 --> 46:12.070
Well, what would that be?

46:12.103 --> 46:13.839
- You know what I think it is?

46:13.872 --> 46:14.873
It's simple.

46:15.606 --> 46:17.242
He doesn't need me anymore

46:17.275 --> 46:18.076
- [Crystal] Oh come on.

46:18.109 --> 46:18.910
- No, no, no.

46:18.944 --> 46:19.544
He doesn't.

46:19.577 --> 46:21.512
He doesn't need me.

46:21.546 --> 46:24.382
He knows I don't
need him, really.

46:25.450 --> 46:27.052
I mean,

46:27.085 --> 46:29.154
I'm the one having our baby.

46:29.187 --> 46:32.123
At the end of the day, it's
my responsibility, not his.

46:32.157 --> 46:35.093
- But Jean, he
would never do that.

46:36.194 --> 46:39.397
- He knows I'm
financially stable.

46:39.430 --> 46:41.066
He knows I could
just work from home.

46:41.099 --> 46:44.035
Could even get a
nanny to help out.

46:47.205 --> 46:50.408
I don't know what
I want anymore.

46:50.441 --> 46:54.212
But it would be nice
if the baby had a dad.

46:56.081 --> 46:58.917
- Maybe you are a
little hormonal.

47:01.920 --> 47:05.290
- Oh my god, I was so drunk
at Kelly's last weekend.

47:05.323 --> 47:06.992
Did you hear about
Peter pissing her bed?

47:07.025 --> 47:08.626
- [Shawna] Yeah, little pervert.

47:08.659 --> 47:09.995
- Shawna.

47:10.028 --> 47:12.163
Shawna, I pissed her bed.

47:12.197 --> 47:13.932
- You slut bag.
- Totally.

47:13.965 --> 47:15.867
Peter totally took
the wrap for me.

47:15.901 --> 47:18.469
- You think that's bad?

47:18.503 --> 47:20.138
I peed myself.

47:20.171 --> 47:21.072
- What?

47:21.106 --> 47:22.240
- Yeah.

47:22.273 --> 47:23.975
It was a sleepover at her
house in the seventh grade.

47:24.009 --> 47:25.076
You didn't hear about this?

47:25.110 --> 47:26.044
- [Tracy] No.

47:26.077 --> 47:27.278
- [Shawna] Take a right up here.

47:27.312 --> 47:28.579
- Seriously?

47:28.613 --> 47:29.414
This is my street.

47:29.447 --> 47:30.348
- No way.

47:30.381 --> 47:32.017
You wanna come party with us?

47:32.050 --> 47:36.287
- [Cary] Oh, I mean, I
already have company over.

47:36.321 --> 47:37.455
- Oh.

47:37.488 --> 47:38.523
Okay.

47:39.357 --> 47:40.325
And,

47:40.358 --> 47:41.559
here it is.

47:41.592 --> 47:43.228
- [Cary] You gotta
be shittin' me.

47:43.261 --> 47:44.295
This is my apartment.

47:44.329 --> 47:46.031
- [Tracy] Wait, wait, what?

47:46.064 --> 47:47.198
What's going on?

47:47.232 --> 47:50.368
- This isn't your party is it?

47:50.401 --> 47:53.038
- Uh no, I live
on the main floor.

47:53.071 --> 47:54.272
You must be going
to my neighbors

47:54.305 --> 47:55.373
on the second floor.

47:55.406 --> 47:56.407
- Huh.

47:56.441 --> 47:57.375
Cute place.

47:57.408 --> 47:58.676
Small world, huh?

47:58.709 --> 47:59.544
- Tiny.

48:00.511 --> 48:01.379
Uh.

48:01.412 --> 48:02.948
Hey, uh.

48:02.981 --> 48:04.382
(laughing)

48:04.415 --> 48:05.350
I mean, it's not that crazy.

48:05.383 --> 48:07.418
You were in the
neighborhood, weren't you?

48:07.452 --> 48:11.022
- Yeah, um, I'll see
you later, Scary Cary.

48:12.190 --> 48:14.459
- Are you gonna come up?

48:14.492 --> 48:16.327
- Oh, uh, no, no.

48:16.361 --> 48:18.263
I don't think so.

48:18.296 --> 48:19.497
I have company.

48:19.530 --> 48:20.665
- Maybe I ought
to come down then.

48:20.698 --> 48:22.600
- Oh god, please don't.

48:28.073 --> 48:31.476
- If this is your place,
aren't you gonna park?

48:31.509 --> 48:32.410
- Um, no.

48:32.443 --> 48:35.046
My parking spot's in the back.

48:36.047 --> 48:37.048
- Okay.

48:37.082 --> 48:37.682
Well.

48:37.715 --> 48:39.650
Thanks for the ride.

48:39.684 --> 48:40.718
Happy New Year.

48:40.751 --> 48:42.387
- Happy New Year.

48:44.622 --> 48:48.159
(slow orchestral music)

49:08.013 --> 49:10.115
(chuckling)

49:10.148 --> 49:12.417
- I felt so bad about last
night that I was gonna

49:12.450 --> 49:16.554
tell him this story about
how, when we first met,

49:17.688 --> 49:19.590
it wasn't actually, you
know, the first time

49:19.624 --> 49:20.758
I had seen him.

49:20.791 --> 49:22.293
- How did you two meet?

49:22.327 --> 49:24.062
- Well we met at
a show, actually.

49:24.095 --> 49:25.096
One of his shows.

49:25.130 --> 49:26.131
Their shows.

49:28.133 --> 49:30.768
I gave him my business
card at the time.

49:30.801 --> 49:34.239
These flimsy Kinko's copy
cards that I had made

49:34.272 --> 49:37.575
for my short-lived
music PR company.

49:37.608 --> 49:39.510
And, it wasn't until
after they hired me

49:39.544 --> 49:41.446
that we started dating.

49:42.680 --> 49:44.715
What I never told him

49:44.749 --> 49:47.285
is that I had
actually seen him play

49:47.318 --> 49:49.154
a couple times already

49:50.555 --> 49:52.623
and I had, like, seen him
around town and stuff.

49:52.657 --> 49:56.661
But, I just didn't know
how to approach him

49:56.694 --> 49:59.764
without seeming,
you know, gross.

49:59.797 --> 50:01.099
So

50:01.132 --> 50:02.767
I started a PR company

50:04.402 --> 50:06.504
to give myself an excuse
to go up and talk to him.

50:06.537 --> 50:07.638
- What?

50:07.672 --> 50:09.574
That is so adorable.

50:09.607 --> 50:11.542
Why didn't you ever tell him?

50:11.576 --> 50:12.710
- I don't know.

50:12.743 --> 50:14.545
I mean, it seemed

50:14.579 --> 50:18.549
kind of unprofessional and I
actually took money from them.

50:19.750 --> 50:21.719
But to be fair, I really
did start a PR company.

50:21.752 --> 50:24.422
I just started it that day.

50:24.455 --> 50:26.091
And Iitdid pretty
well, actually.

50:26.124 --> 50:28.093
That's how I ended
up at Chellem-Howell.

50:28.126 --> 50:28.759
- Wow.

50:30.295 --> 50:33.531
I think you should tell
him, he'll love it.

50:33.564 --> 50:35.633
- It doesn't really matter.

50:36.767 --> 50:39.470
I just wanted to remind him of

50:41.606 --> 50:42.240
you know

50:43.474 --> 50:46.144
how important it felt back then.

50:47.678 --> 50:49.814
I practically altered
my life trajectory

50:49.847 --> 50:53.151
just to have a chance
to talk to him.

50:56.587 --> 51:00.258
He once drove overnight
for 18 straight hours

51:00.291 --> 51:03.561
from Austin just to
see me one day sooner.

51:07.332 --> 51:09.234
He'd never do that now.

51:13.138 --> 51:14.205
- Well how's work going now?

51:14.239 --> 51:17.108
How's the new company going?

51:17.142 --> 51:18.143
- Oh my god.

51:19.277 --> 51:21.346
I should be asking
you something.

51:21.379 --> 51:22.547
- Oh.

51:22.580 --> 51:24.515
- How's Magnolia?
(laughing)

51:24.549 --> 51:25.550
How's being a mom?

51:25.583 --> 51:26.817
How's...

51:26.851 --> 51:28.653
How is your work going?

51:28.686 --> 51:31.189
- You know, it's
tough, but it's good.

51:31.222 --> 51:32.890
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

51:32.923 --> 51:36.327
- God, I feel really
terrible asking you this,

51:36.361 --> 51:37.595
but what do you do again?

51:37.628 --> 51:38.696
- Oh, that's okay.

51:38.729 --> 51:41.166
I work with battered women.

51:43.768 --> 51:45.270
- Oh my god.

51:45.303 --> 51:46.571
Oh.

51:46.604 --> 51:48.739
This must just all sound
so petty to you and dull

51:48.773 --> 51:49.574
and awful.

51:49.607 --> 51:51.376
- Are you kidding me?

51:51.409 --> 51:54.712
I wish that more women
were as strong as you are.

51:54.745 --> 51:58.616
But then I guess I'd
be out of a job, so.

51:58.649 --> 52:00.518
- Maybe you should
be talking to Cary.

52:00.551 --> 52:01.719
I mean, really.

52:01.752 --> 52:03.154
- Yeah, have his people
contact my people--

52:03.188 --> 52:05.556
- Hey everyone, free beer!

52:05.590 --> 52:06.757
Hey.

52:06.791 --> 52:09.394
(laughing)

52:09.427 --> 52:11.362
Hey, what'd I miss?

52:11.396 --> 52:14.499
(upbeat jazzy music)

52:17.668 --> 52:18.736
Hey, whoa.

52:18.769 --> 52:19.937
- Cary.

52:19.970 --> 52:22.440
- It's alright,
it's fine, I'm fine.

52:22.473 --> 52:23.274
I'm fine.

52:23.308 --> 52:24.509
Hey.

52:24.542 --> 52:26.377
How about that email, huh?

52:26.411 --> 52:27.478
Jesus Christ.

52:28.746 --> 52:30.815
- Yeah, she was a little
miffed, I suppose.

52:30.848 --> 52:32.650
- A little miffed?

52:32.683 --> 52:34.785
She ripped everybody
a new asshole.

52:34.819 --> 52:35.786
- Really?

52:35.820 --> 52:38.456
I guess I didn't read it
as harshly as all that.

52:38.489 --> 52:39.790
She's been under a lot of
pressure, you know with

52:39.824 --> 52:41.659
some of the bigger clients.

52:41.692 --> 52:43.261
- You know,

52:43.294 --> 52:45.863
I think I know who
she's talking about.

52:45.896 --> 52:47.198
- Who?

52:47.232 --> 52:48.766
- Patterson.

52:48.799 --> 52:51.269
He's been doing real
shit work lately.

52:51.302 --> 52:53.438
I don't think he even
gives a fuck, you know?

52:53.471 --> 52:54.672
But still.

52:54.705 --> 52:55.973
That was bullshit that
she ripped into us

52:56.006 --> 52:57.708
on New Year's Eve?

52:58.676 --> 53:00.711
- Get a couple of drinks
while you were out?

53:00.745 --> 53:01.579
- I,

53:02.547 --> 53:04.282
I had one at the Getaway.

53:04.315 --> 53:06.584
Oh, that's where I
first stopped to get

53:06.617 --> 53:08.219
your gluten-free.

53:08.253 --> 53:09.987
- You really didn't have to.

53:10.020 --> 53:11.422
- No, man, it's okay.

53:11.456 --> 53:12.423
It's no worries, no.

53:12.457 --> 53:13.824
And sorry it took me so long.

53:13.858 --> 53:15.360
I probably should have
stopped after the second place

53:15.393 --> 53:17.495
but then it became
sort of a mission.

53:17.528 --> 53:18.696
- Well it tastes even
better knowing what you

53:18.729 --> 53:20.298
went through to track it down.

53:20.331 --> 53:21.732
- Ah.

53:21.766 --> 53:24.935
- So, do you have
a gluten allergy?

53:24.969 --> 53:28.506
- I just try to avoid
it whenever I can.

53:29.874 --> 53:31.576
Initially I thought
the whole gluten scare

53:31.609 --> 53:34.679
was just an excuse for
people to avoid eating carbs,

53:34.712 --> 53:36.714
but then like, my mom tried...

53:36.747 --> 53:40.718
(Kyle drowned out
by tinkling music)

53:48.959 --> 53:52.497
(slow orchestral music)

53:59.904 --> 54:02.540
Is it getting crazed
out there for New Years?

54:02.573 --> 54:03.474
- Oh, it's,

54:04.542 --> 54:06.444
they were not too wild.

54:07.612 --> 54:09.847
The liquor stores are
kind of busy though.

54:09.880 --> 54:12.283
Hey, hey you know
what we should do?

54:12.317 --> 54:14.319
We should set up a show.

54:15.085 --> 54:17.288
- Really?
- Yeah.

54:17.322 --> 54:18.723
- I thought we were
taking a break?

54:18.756 --> 54:21.692
Or a hiatus or whatever
you wanted to call it.

54:21.726 --> 54:22.960
- Oh, I know.

54:22.993 --> 54:24.662
I just think it would
be good to set up a show

54:24.695 --> 54:26.431
and create a local presence.

54:26.464 --> 54:27.598
- Cool with me.

54:27.632 --> 54:28.933
Set up a show, I'll be there.

54:28.966 --> 54:29.767
- Yeah?

54:29.800 --> 54:30.801
- Yeah.

54:30.835 --> 54:32.036
- Oh well, hell.

54:32.069 --> 54:35.706
Might as well parlay it into
some regional shows, too, man.

54:35.740 --> 54:36.574
- Yeah.

54:37.742 --> 54:41.912
I mean, there's work to
consider and everything, but,

54:41.946 --> 54:43.614
yeah.

54:43.648 --> 54:45.483
- Yeah, maybe it isn't the
best time to, you know,

54:45.516 --> 54:49.887
hit the road with a baby
on the way and the wedding.

54:49.920 --> 54:52.022
- I was thinking the
same thing, you know.

54:52.056 --> 54:54.892
I'm sure your hands
are very full.

54:56.494 --> 54:57.395
- I love your dog.

54:57.428 --> 54:59.096
She's so sweet.

54:59.129 --> 55:00.731
- Oh thanks.

55:00.765 --> 55:04.068
Yeah, sorry she smells
like a thousand butt holes.

55:05.970 --> 55:06.837
Oh.

55:06.871 --> 55:10.307
Your daughter, she
is a stone cold fox.

55:11.075 --> 55:13.478
- Oh, (laughing) thank you.

55:13.511 --> 55:16.814
I supposed she can smell
like one butt hole sometimes.

55:16.847 --> 55:19.116
(laughing)

55:19.149 --> 55:21.519
- Curse you, shitty neighbors.

55:21.552 --> 55:22.787
- [Crystal] At least
they have an excuse.

55:22.820 --> 55:24.622
- They didn't even
bother to tell us.

55:24.655 --> 55:26.391
- They didn't
bother to invite us.

55:26.424 --> 55:28.092
That's what Jean's
so upset about.

55:28.125 --> 55:29.494
- Yeah.

55:29.527 --> 55:31.929
Yeah, Cary, that's
what I'm upset about.

55:31.962 --> 55:35.633
- Oh, I didn't realize it
mattered so much to you.

55:35.666 --> 55:38.403
- And I didn't realize we
mattered so little to you.

55:38.436 --> 55:39.604
- We should get going.

55:39.637 --> 55:40.871
- No, no, stay.

55:40.905 --> 55:42.106
Stay.

55:42.139 --> 55:44.842
You just sat down
and Jean, well Jean

55:44.875 --> 55:46.811
is just getting warmed up.

55:46.844 --> 55:48.413
- They've been here
nearly an hour.

55:48.446 --> 55:50.581
You've just sat down.

55:50.615 --> 55:52.149
- [Kyle] Thanks
for the beer man.

55:52.182 --> 55:53.684
- Taking off, huh?

55:53.718 --> 55:57.555
Sorry my fiancee
cut the party short.

55:57.588 --> 55:58.956
- I cut the party short?

55:58.989 --> 56:01.959
You hardly even
showed up for it.

56:01.992 --> 56:03.561
Thank you for being here.

56:03.594 --> 56:04.228
Thank you.

56:05.195 --> 56:06.997
- Call me if you need anything.

56:07.031 --> 56:09.667
- [Cary] What is she gonna need?

56:09.700 --> 56:10.968
- Everything cool, then?

56:11.001 --> 56:13.738
- Yeah, everything's cool.

56:13.771 --> 56:15.973
Just having a baby, you know.

56:17.708 --> 56:19.477
- Jean's really great, man.

56:19.510 --> 56:21.011
Don't be too hard on her.

56:21.045 --> 56:22.947
- She's pretty great?

56:22.980 --> 56:24.148
What about me?

56:24.181 --> 56:25.783
I'm the one getting
reamed out here.

56:25.816 --> 56:27.017
- Just,

56:27.051 --> 56:28.018
take it easy.

56:28.052 --> 56:29.687
Cool?

56:29.720 --> 56:30.688
- Yeah.

56:30.721 --> 56:31.556
Cool.

56:32.757 --> 56:35.893
(slow orchestral music)

56:48.873 --> 56:50.941
(knocking)

56:50.975 --> 56:52.009
Jean?

56:54.011 --> 56:56.681
I'm gonna go walk the dog, okay?

57:02.920 --> 57:03.988
Come on, Pearly.
(cellphone ringing)

57:04.021 --> 57:05.189
Come on, girl.

57:08.192 --> 57:11.195
(cellphone ringing)

57:13.030 --> 57:15.600
(cellphone ringing)

57:15.633 --> 57:16.801
Hey, what's up?

57:16.834 --> 57:19.904
* Happy New Year to you

57:19.937 --> 57:22.607
* Happy New Year to you

57:22.640 --> 57:24.942
Okay, okay, that's enough.

57:24.975 --> 57:25.910
- [Sharon] How's my little man?

57:25.943 --> 57:27.945
Are you guys having
a nice night at home?

57:27.978 --> 57:28.779
- Yeah.

57:28.813 --> 57:29.780
Yeah, you know.

57:29.814 --> 57:31.048
It's okay.

57:31.081 --> 57:31.949
- [Sharon] Did you
open your present?

57:31.982 --> 57:34.084
- Yeah, yeah, they're
a little tight.

57:34.118 --> 57:36.186
- [Sharon] Meh, you're
just a ponchie, that's all.

57:36.220 --> 57:38.088
Can't you suck it in?

57:38.122 --> 57:39.590
- No, that's not it, mom.

57:39.624 --> 57:40.858
They're too small.

57:40.891 --> 57:42.092
You always buy me
a size too small.

57:42.126 --> 57:44.662
- [Sharon] Okay, I'll shop at
Men's Warehouse from now on.

57:44.695 --> 57:45.663
- Okay yeah.

57:45.696 --> 57:47.031
Can I go now?

57:47.064 --> 57:48.866
- [Sharon] "Can I go now?"

57:48.899 --> 57:50.535
What are you, four?

57:50.568 --> 57:52.102
- Well that's how you
treat me sometimes.

57:52.136 --> 57:55.205
- [Sharon] 'Cause that's
how you act sometimes.

57:55.239 --> 57:57.007
- Okay, what'd you
say to Jean today?

57:57.041 --> 57:58.809
She's all pissed off now.

57:58.843 --> 58:00.811
- [Sharon] She's all pissed off?

58:00.845 --> 58:02.680
She threatened not to
move her wedding date

58:02.713 --> 58:04.715
after I told her
I couldn't make it

58:04.749 --> 58:07.084
and she's all pissed off?

58:07.117 --> 58:09.520
Boy, you got a real fire
cracker on your hands.

58:09.554 --> 58:10.721
- But mom, you
could've said something

58:10.755 --> 58:12.089
a little bit earlier you know.

58:12.122 --> 58:15.025
- [Sharon] I am saying
something earlier.

58:15.059 --> 58:17.061
Cary, all she's done
is rented a hall

58:17.094 --> 58:19.129
so move the date, big deal.

58:19.163 --> 58:22.266
- Okay, well, there may
not even be a date now.

58:22.299 --> 58:24.134
- [Sharon] What?

58:24.168 --> 58:25.102
Why?

58:25.135 --> 58:25.936
What's going on?

58:25.970 --> 58:27.204
- Nothing, nothing.

58:27.237 --> 58:29.039
We have to reschedule now.

58:29.073 --> 58:30.274
I don't know.

58:30.307 --> 58:33.844
- [Sharon] Well, I don't know
what the big rush is anyway.

58:33.878 --> 58:35.312
- I don't know, ask Jean.

58:35.345 --> 58:36.246
- [Sharon] You sure
got your hands full

58:36.280 --> 58:38.282
with that one, don't you?

58:38.315 --> 58:42.687
- Mom, it doesn't help out to
cut her down like that, okay?

58:44.088 --> 58:45.189
- [Sharon] Well someone's
gotta stand up to her.

58:45.222 --> 58:48.092
It sure as hell
ain't gonna be you.

58:48.125 --> 58:49.259
- Mom.

58:49.293 --> 58:50.995
- [Sharon] I don't know how
you ended up so spineless.

58:51.028 --> 58:53.798
You're just like your
father sometimes, I swear.

58:53.831 --> 58:55.265
- Okay, um, you know what?

58:55.299 --> 58:57.968
I gotta go, so have
a good New Year.

58:58.002 --> 58:59.570
- [Sharon] Oh,
don't be so upset.

58:59.604 --> 59:01.906
Everything will
turn out just fine.

59:01.939 --> 59:03.173
And what's it matter if
you're married or not

59:03.207 --> 59:05.009
when the baby's born anyway?

59:05.042 --> 59:06.043
- I don't know.

59:06.076 --> 59:08.278
Thanks for the pants.

59:08.312 --> 59:10.848
- [Sharon] Love you sweetie.

59:10.881 --> 59:12.683
- Love you, too.

59:12.717 --> 59:13.550
- Elliot!

59:15.753 --> 59:16.587
Elliot!

59:18.222 --> 59:19.056
Elliot!

59:26.897 --> 59:28.132
- Go this way.

59:28.165 --> 59:29.199
- [Little Girl] Elliot!

59:29.233 --> 59:31.035
- [Man] Hey puppy puppy.

59:31.068 --> 59:34.038
Look at that loaf of bread.

59:34.071 --> 59:35.105
- [Little Girl] Elliot!

59:35.139 --> 59:36.807
- Hey pooch.

59:36.841 --> 59:38.308
Hey man, you want a beer?

59:38.342 --> 59:39.977
- [Cary] Come on.

59:40.878 --> 59:41.712
- Eh, yeah man.

59:41.746 --> 59:43.080
They're not mine.

59:43.113 --> 59:45.049
- Yeah, sounds right.

59:53.023 --> 59:55.059
- The party's upstairs man.

59:55.092 --> 59:56.193
Second floor.

01:00:05.369 --> 01:00:08.372
(upbeat rock music)

01:00:33.731 --> 01:00:37.367
* I get the feeling that
the worst isn't over

01:00:37.401 --> 01:00:39.103
- Hey, what up, man?

01:00:39.136 --> 01:00:40.137
Too loud for you down there?

01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:41.105
- Huh?

01:00:41.138 --> 01:00:42.106
Uh, nah.

01:00:42.139 --> 01:00:43.173
No, no, no.

01:00:43.207 --> 01:00:44.208
You're okay.

01:00:45.309 --> 01:00:46.310
Happy New Year.

01:00:46.343 --> 01:00:47.244
- Yeah, Happy New Year.

01:00:47.277 --> 01:00:49.747
Where's your wife?

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:52.116
- Oh no, man, we're not married.

01:00:52.149 --> 01:00:54.685
I think she went to bed.

01:00:54.719 --> 01:00:56.120
- [Man] Fuck it,
man, Happy New Years.

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:57.187
- Yeah.

01:00:58.488 --> 01:01:00.357
Hey, you guys are still here.

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:02.092
- Jake, it's Scary Cary.

01:01:02.126 --> 01:01:04.361
- No shit, look
everyone, Scary Cary.

01:01:04.394 --> 01:01:06.396
- Scary Cary, where's
your room mate?

01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:07.965
- Oh, um.

01:01:07.998 --> 01:01:09.867
I think she went to bed.

01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:10.801
- What about your
little shindig?

01:01:10.835 --> 01:01:12.202
Everyone pass out already?

01:01:12.236 --> 01:01:13.403
- Uh, yeah.

01:01:13.437 --> 01:01:16.473
They're just an
old married couple.

01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:18.175
Buddy duddies.

01:01:18.208 --> 01:01:19.844
- Fuck yeah.

01:01:19.877 --> 01:01:22.479
This place is totally lame
but we're kind of stuck here.

01:01:22.512 --> 01:01:24.148
I mean, at least until midnight.

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:25.315
We don't wanna be in like a
cab or something on New Year's.

01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:27.918
- No, that would totally suck.

01:01:27.952 --> 01:01:29.486
I mean, I remember when
I was in New York--

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:32.156
- What are you doing here?

01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:33.290
- I don't know.

01:01:33.323 --> 01:01:35.826
I mean, I live
downstairs so I thought

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:37.094
I'd just pop up.

01:01:37.127 --> 01:01:38.162
- Oh, you thought
you'd just pop up?

01:01:38.195 --> 01:01:39.864
- Hey.

01:01:39.897 --> 01:01:42.166
I just realized I didn't pay
you back for that 12 pack.

01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:43.200
- No.

01:01:43.233 --> 01:01:45.302
You completely did not.

01:01:45.335 --> 01:01:48.238
- I would offer you another
beer, but we're all out.

01:01:48.272 --> 01:01:50.274
Can you grab some
from downstairs?

01:01:50.307 --> 01:01:51.976
- Oh, uh.

01:01:52.009 --> 01:01:55.312
Well I probably should only
stay for a minute, but,

01:01:55.345 --> 01:01:57.381
you can, we can share this.

01:01:58.482 --> 01:02:01.018
(rock music)

01:02:04.855 --> 01:02:06.090
- Uh, we're going to
a party after this.

01:02:06.123 --> 01:02:07.191
Wanna come?

01:02:07.224 --> 01:02:10.327
- Uh, I think I should
probably stick around here.

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:13.063
- But, how am I ever
gonna pay you back?

01:02:13.097 --> 01:02:15.032
- Slut.
(coughing)

01:02:15.065 --> 01:02:16.266
(laughing)

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:17.968
- Wanna go have a smoke with me?

01:02:18.002 --> 01:02:19.303
- Okay.

01:02:19.336 --> 01:02:20.805
- [Jake] Hey bruh,
Happy New Years.

01:02:20.838 --> 01:02:22.172
- Oh thanks man.

01:02:24.308 --> 01:02:25.910
- Oh come on man, you
can drink more than that.

01:02:25.943 --> 01:02:28.078
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:02:28.112 --> 01:02:28.946
- Alright.

01:02:32.282 --> 01:02:34.451
(all exclaiming)

01:02:34.484 --> 01:02:36.320
- [Jake] Where'd you
learn to drink like that?

01:02:36.353 --> 01:02:37.154
- Are you alright, dude?

01:02:37.187 --> 01:02:38.422
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:02:39.824 --> 01:02:41.125
- Hey bruh, you might as
well finish the bottle.

01:02:41.158 --> 01:02:42.359
- No, I'm cool man.

01:02:42.392 --> 01:02:43.360
- [Jake] Come on, it's
New Years, drink up.

01:02:43.393 --> 01:02:44.328
- Yeah.

01:02:44.361 --> 01:02:47.231
One more won't hurt, right?

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:49.299
(coughing)
(laughing)

01:02:49.333 --> 01:02:51.468
- [Tracy] Oh shit.

01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:54.404
(rock music)

01:02:54.438 --> 01:02:56.006
(coughing)

01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:57.241
- What the fuck?

01:02:57.274 --> 01:02:58.375
(barfing)

01:02:58.408 --> 01:02:59.977
What the fuck, man?

01:03:01.912 --> 01:03:03.080
- Excuse me, excuse me.

01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:05.415
- [Woman] What the fuck?

01:03:05.449 --> 01:03:08.986
(slow orchestral music)

01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:22.366
* You should fold
up your telescope

01:03:22.399 --> 01:03:26.570
* Chuck your compass
at the unknown

01:03:29.439 --> 01:03:32.176
* You should shoot
out every star

01:03:32.209 --> 01:03:35.512
* All they've gotten you is lost

01:03:35.545 --> 01:03:39.383
* They burned out so long ago

01:03:42.452 --> 01:03:46.290
* Those twinkly little lights

01:03:47.257 --> 01:03:50.494
* Be hung from the window sill

01:03:50.527 --> 01:03:53.430
* Just above our bed

01:03:53.463 --> 01:03:57.434
* Our first studio, we
barely could make the rent

01:03:59.436 --> 01:04:03.340
* So we held our
world on a string

01:04:05.209 --> 01:04:09.379
* We had an answer
for everything

01:04:20.524 --> 01:04:25.062
(rock music in the distance)
(people chattering)

01:04:25.095 --> 01:04:27.464
- What were you doing in there?

01:04:28.665 --> 01:04:30.634
- I was just brushing my teeth.

01:04:30.667 --> 01:04:32.502
Getting ready for bed.

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:35.639
- It's not even midnight yet.

01:04:35.672 --> 01:04:37.307
Going to bed already?

01:04:37.341 --> 01:04:39.676
- Last I saw, you were in
bed, so I just figured that--

01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:41.278
- No.

01:04:41.311 --> 01:04:42.980
I wasn't in bed.

01:04:43.013 --> 01:04:45.049
I was in our bedroom, crying.

01:04:45.082 --> 01:04:49.186
Last you saw me, I was
slamming our bedroom door.

01:04:55.425 --> 01:04:58.495
I talked to Kyle
about that work email.

01:04:58.528 --> 01:04:59.529
- Oh yeah?

01:04:59.563 --> 01:05:00.998
What'd he say?

01:05:01.031 --> 01:05:01.966
- [Jean] Why does
everything have to be

01:05:01.999 --> 01:05:03.433
so difficult with you?

01:05:03.467 --> 01:05:05.369
- Who's being difficult?

01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:08.038
I just said, "What'd he say?"

01:05:09.239 --> 01:05:12.442
- He told me that
Mary is exhausted.

01:05:12.476 --> 01:05:13.510
She doesn't know
what to do with you.

01:05:13.543 --> 01:05:14.411
- What?

01:05:14.444 --> 01:05:15.645
Well how about I quit?

01:05:15.679 --> 01:05:16.446
And then she won't
have to worry about

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:17.647
what to do with me--

01:05:17.681 --> 01:05:19.183
- It's like trigger
response for everything.

01:05:19.216 --> 01:05:20.350
- Fuck her, you know.

01:05:20.384 --> 01:05:23.120
If she doesn't like my work,
she can just suck a dick.

01:05:23.153 --> 01:05:23.988
- Jesus.

01:05:25.455 --> 01:05:28.458
What has gotten
into you tonight?

01:05:28.492 --> 01:05:30.060
Are you wasted or something?

01:05:30.094 --> 01:05:31.228
- What?

01:05:31.261 --> 01:05:32.229
When do I have
time to get wasted?

01:05:32.262 --> 01:05:33.497
This is like the
tamest New Years

01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:35.399
since I watched the ball
drop with my grandma.

01:05:35.432 --> 01:05:36.266
- When?

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:38.435
You have been gone
all goddamn night.

01:05:38.468 --> 01:05:39.736
You tell me when.

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:41.405
- This is stupid.

01:05:44.174 --> 01:05:45.942
- What are you doing?

01:05:48.312 --> 01:05:49.479
We were having a conversation.

01:05:49.513 --> 01:05:51.581
- Well, I just figured that
if I'm gonna get reamed out

01:05:51.615 --> 01:05:55.585
for being drunk, I might
as well be having a beer.

01:05:57.687 --> 01:05:58.588
Gra-zoom.

01:05:58.622 --> 01:05:59.623
- God, Cary.

01:06:01.091 --> 01:06:02.659
When did you become
such a prick?

01:06:02.692 --> 01:06:03.593
- Me?

01:06:03.627 --> 01:06:06.063
I should be asking you that.

01:06:09.633 --> 01:06:12.569
- I know I've been
mean lately, okay?

01:06:12.602 --> 01:06:17.007
Do you know how awful
that makes me feel?

01:06:17.041 --> 01:06:19.009
I'm only reacting to
how absent you've been.

01:06:19.043 --> 01:06:23.213
You've been like on a
different planet for weeks now.

01:06:24.548 --> 01:06:29.186
Do you think I like yelling
at you all the time?

01:06:29.219 --> 01:06:30.720
I love you.

01:06:30.754 --> 01:06:33.223
You can't just quit your
job if you don't like it.

01:06:33.257 --> 01:06:35.059
We're having a baby.

01:06:35.092 --> 01:06:36.526
- I'm not gonna
quit my job, okay?

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:40.664
She just, the whole
company just pisses me off.

01:06:41.565 --> 01:06:44.301
- Is that how
you'd deal with us?

01:06:45.635 --> 01:06:46.603
Would you just quit?

01:06:46.636 --> 01:06:50.140
- I said I'm not gonna
quit my job, alright?

01:06:51.708 --> 01:06:53.043
- Where were you tonight?

01:06:53.077 --> 01:06:54.578
- What do you mean where was I?

01:06:54.611 --> 01:06:56.546
I was running around town
trying to get gluten-free

01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:59.449
piss beer for Benedict
Arnold or some shit.

01:06:59.483 --> 01:07:00.750
- No, what took you so long?

01:07:00.784 --> 01:07:02.752
How many drinks did you
have at The Getaway?

01:07:02.786 --> 01:07:03.687
- Why?

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.622
Are we counting beers now?

01:07:05.655 --> 01:07:06.623
I don't know.

01:07:06.656 --> 01:07:07.624
A couple?

01:07:07.657 --> 01:07:09.393
And if you must know,
they're having trouble

01:07:09.426 --> 01:07:10.827
with the new
bartender so I had to

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:13.097
jump behind the bar
and help 'em out.

01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:15.465
- You left me alone
with your friends

01:07:15.499 --> 01:07:17.667
so you could have--
- You invited them.

01:07:17.701 --> 01:07:19.569
- They invited themselves.

01:07:19.603 --> 01:07:21.338
They were coming
over to see you.

01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:22.839
And then you skipped
out, leaving me alone

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:25.542
to awkwardly dish up
small talk all night.

01:07:25.575 --> 01:07:28.545
- No you, no, no, you
are friends with Crystal.

01:07:28.578 --> 01:07:29.679
You guys were texting.

01:07:29.713 --> 01:07:31.515
- We are friends of convenience.

01:07:31.548 --> 01:07:33.683
Our fucking husbands
slash fiances,

01:07:33.717 --> 01:07:36.220
or whatever the fuck you
are now, are old friends,

01:07:36.253 --> 01:07:38.155
so we are just
picking up the slack,

01:07:38.188 --> 01:07:40.624
so social engagements
like tonight

01:07:40.657 --> 01:07:42.192
aren't so uncomfortable,
which it was,

01:07:42.226 --> 01:07:43.527
because you were
absent for most of it.

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:44.661
- I'm not gonna stand
here and be cussed out

01:07:44.694 --> 01:07:48.598
because Kyle decided to
come over and parade around

01:07:48.632 --> 01:07:50.600
his baby and his wife.

01:07:50.634 --> 01:07:52.669
- Oh my god, don't even
get me started on that.

01:07:52.702 --> 01:07:53.870
- On what?

01:07:53.903 --> 01:07:55.239
- I saw you checking
her out tonight.

01:07:55.272 --> 01:07:56.640
You think I'm that dim?

01:07:56.673 --> 01:07:58.575
Yeah, she's fucking hot.

01:07:58.608 --> 01:07:59.476
- What am I supposed to do?

01:07:59.509 --> 01:08:00.844
Stare at the floor
when I talk to her?

01:08:00.877 --> 01:08:02.746
- Oh my gosh, ugh,
just forget it, ugh!

01:08:02.779 --> 01:08:06.150
You make me act like a
fucking 14-year-old, I swear.

01:08:06.183 --> 01:08:07.184
- [Cary] Fine, what else?

01:08:07.217 --> 01:08:08.385
What's next?

01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:09.586
What else am I
doing wrong, Jean?

01:08:09.619 --> 01:08:10.520
- I'll tell you what
else bothers me.

01:08:10.554 --> 01:08:12.322
What bothers me

01:08:12.356 --> 01:08:14.424
is that you get so
riled up about Kyle

01:08:14.458 --> 01:08:16.560
and about work and
everything but when I said

01:08:16.593 --> 01:08:17.694
all those awful things
to you last night

01:08:17.727 --> 01:08:20.296
you basically just shrugged
it off and went to bed.

01:08:20.330 --> 01:08:21.531
- What?

01:08:21.564 --> 01:08:23.466
You tell me, let me
get this straight.

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:25.368
Now you're mad at me
because I wasn't mad at you?

01:08:25.402 --> 01:08:28.705
- I am mad because you
don't fucking care.

01:08:28.738 --> 01:08:30.807
I am like textbook
lashing out at you

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:32.841
and you just shrug it off
like I'm some stranger

01:08:32.876 --> 01:08:34.310
off the street.

01:08:34.344 --> 01:08:35.612
No, no, no.

01:08:35.645 --> 01:08:36.580
No, that's not even it.

01:08:36.613 --> 01:08:38.215
You would go off on a stranger.

01:08:38.247 --> 01:08:39.716
I'm like even less
than a stranger to you.

01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:41.651
You don't give a fuck
what I think about you

01:08:41.685 --> 01:08:43.752
'cause you don't
give a fuck about me!

01:08:43.787 --> 01:08:45.154
- Yeah, I do, of course I do.

01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:46.689
Why else do you think
I put up with you

01:08:46.723 --> 01:08:48.192
yelling at me everyday?

01:08:48.225 --> 01:08:49.658
- 'Cause you're too
chicken shit to leave.

01:08:49.693 --> 01:08:50.594
- What?

01:08:50.627 --> 01:08:51.728
Oh god, you want me to leave?

01:08:51.761 --> 01:08:53.162
You'd love that, huh?
- Cut it out.

01:08:53.197 --> 01:08:54.898
I don't wanna play
head games with you.

01:08:54.930 --> 01:08:56.765
- Who's playing games?

01:08:58.301 --> 01:09:02.138
(rock music in the distance)
(people chattering)

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:19.356
- I am sorry, for
what it's worth.

01:09:23.727 --> 01:09:25.729
Sorry for saying those
things last night.

01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:26.930
I didn't mean them.

01:09:26.962 --> 01:09:28.497
- Yeah, you did.

01:09:29.466 --> 01:09:30.700
It doesn't matter.

01:09:30.734 --> 01:09:32.602
I don't care anyway.

01:09:34.537 --> 01:09:35.372
- See?

01:09:38.375 --> 01:09:41.545
There's that shitty,
careless attitude.

01:09:41.578 --> 01:09:44.613
You truly don't give a
fuck what I think of you?

01:09:44.648 --> 01:09:47.484
- What, you think I'm
a loser, so fuck you.

01:09:47.517 --> 01:09:48.585
I don't care.

01:09:54.458 --> 01:09:57.761
- You really think I
think that about you?

01:10:00.797 --> 01:10:02.699
You're just some loser?

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:05.402
We're getting married.

01:10:05.435 --> 01:10:07.737
- [Cary] Supposedly, anyway.

01:10:07.771 --> 01:10:10.874
- Cary, I don't
think you're a loser.

01:10:13.477 --> 01:10:15.712
It kills me you think that.

01:10:16.746 --> 01:10:20.284
(slow orchestral music)

01:10:21.685 --> 01:10:23.753
Have you talked to your mom?

01:10:23.787 --> 01:10:24.621
- No.

01:10:30.794 --> 01:10:34.898
(slow acoustic orchestral music)

01:10:40.804 --> 01:10:44.808
* I fell down a well in my mind

01:10:46.743 --> 01:10:48.745
* And I can't traverse it

01:10:48.778 --> 01:10:52.949
* No, I can't reverse
it to save my life

01:10:56.986 --> 01:11:01.291
* If only you'd
throw down a rope

01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:05.395
* But you can't be bothered

01:11:05.429 --> 01:11:07.431
* You've got your own problems

01:11:07.464 --> 01:11:10.467
* You've had enough

01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:16.406
* Not that I could blame you

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:20.910
* Okay, we both
know that's a lie

01:11:20.944 --> 01:11:24.614
* You shoulder the blame
as I stomach the shame

01:11:24.648 --> 01:11:28.752
* In this bottomless cavern

01:11:28.785 --> 01:11:31.555
* If you'd break

01:11:31.588 --> 01:11:33.590
* Me

01:11:33.623 --> 01:11:35.559
* Open

01:11:43.867 --> 01:11:46.903
- I was meaning to
tell you about this,

01:11:48.572 --> 01:11:52.108
this kind of funny secret
about how when we first met,

01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:56.513
it wasn't, you know, the first
time I had seen you play.

01:11:57.947 --> 01:12:00.784
- Yeah, are you talking
about your fake PR company?

01:12:00.817 --> 01:12:01.818
- What?

01:12:01.851 --> 01:12:03.052
You knew about that?

01:12:03.086 --> 01:12:05.855
- Yeah, we all knew about that.

01:12:05.889 --> 01:12:06.890
- Oh my god.

01:12:07.724 --> 01:12:09.092
Why didn't you tell me?

01:12:09.125 --> 01:12:11.528
You just let me take
money from you and stuff?

01:12:11.561 --> 01:12:13.563
- Yeah, I made
the guys hire you.

01:12:13.597 --> 01:12:14.731
- You did?

01:12:14.764 --> 01:12:15.665
- Yeah.

01:12:15.699 --> 01:12:18.067
I wanted to sleep with you.

01:12:18.101 --> 01:12:19.769
- Oh no.

01:12:19.803 --> 01:12:23.573
I am such a slut.
(laughing)

01:12:24.541 --> 01:12:26.476
(laughing)

01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:28.912
Hey, I did a pretty decent
job, though, anyway.

01:12:28.945 --> 01:12:30.880
Despite not knowing what
the hell I was doing.

01:12:30.914 --> 01:12:32.982
- Oh yeah, I think you
did a real good job.

01:12:33.016 --> 01:12:35.519
(laughing)

01:12:35.552 --> 01:12:37.621
- Ah, all this time
we've been holding these

01:12:37.654 --> 01:12:39.989
little lies over each other.

01:12:41.691 --> 01:12:43.860
- That's everyone, though.

01:12:48.732 --> 01:12:51.835
It was a long time
ago, wasn't it?

01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:53.970
- Same year I got Pearly.

01:12:56.906 --> 01:12:58.708
Where is Pearl?

01:12:58.742 --> 01:12:59.943
- She isn't here?

01:12:59.976 --> 01:13:01.845
Oh, maybe I left
her in the back.

01:13:01.878 --> 01:13:02.679
- What?

01:13:02.712 --> 01:13:03.547
Why?

01:13:09.018 --> 01:13:10.920
How could you leave
her in the backyard?

01:13:10.954 --> 01:13:12.856
- [Cary] It's fine, it's not
even that cold out there.

01:13:12.889 --> 01:13:14.558
- [Jean] Yeah it is.

01:13:15.959 --> 01:13:18.127
- [Tracy] Hey, Scary Cary.

01:13:18.962 --> 01:13:20.396
Hey Scary Cary.

01:13:21.531 --> 01:13:25.034
(paper trumpet sounding)

01:13:25.068 --> 01:13:28.438
(slow acoustic music)

01:13:29.739 --> 01:13:31.207
- [Jean] That gate is open.

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:32.576
- Jean, Jean, I'll
check the alley.

01:13:32.609 --> 01:13:34.711
You check the front yard.

01:13:38.982 --> 01:13:40.016
Pearl!

01:13:41.017 --> 01:13:45.188
(tense acoustic
orchestral music)

01:13:54.564 --> 01:13:55.198
Pearl!

01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:57.934
Pearl!

01:13:59.903 --> 01:14:04.040
(tense acoustic
orchestral music)

01:14:06.776 --> 01:14:10.113
- Have any of you
seen a big yellow dog?

01:14:15.018 --> 01:14:18.021
(soft acoustic orchestral music)

01:14:18.054 --> 01:14:20.990
* All my life

01:14:21.024 --> 01:14:23.159
* Has led to this

01:14:23.192 --> 01:14:26.996
* And every moment after it

01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:30.567
* So why can't I commit

01:14:32.769 --> 01:14:35.772
* Snapshots flicker

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:38.207
* In my mind

01:14:38.241 --> 01:14:41.945
* A woman sings a lullaby

01:14:41.978 --> 01:14:45.682
* If only I could hear it

01:14:50.587 --> 01:14:54.991
(upbeat rock music
in the distance)

01:14:55.024 --> 01:14:56.660
- [Cary] Come on.

01:14:56.693 --> 01:14:57.827
- Pearly.

01:14:57.861 --> 01:14:59.028
Oh Pearly.

01:14:59.062 --> 01:15:00.029
Oh, hi baby.

01:15:01.164 --> 01:15:02.866
I was so worried about you.

01:15:02.899 --> 01:15:03.700
Where were you?

01:15:03.733 --> 01:15:04.934
God, you're so cold.

01:15:04.968 --> 01:15:06.035
- She was hanging out
with this neighbor girl.

01:15:06.069 --> 01:15:07.003
Totally safe.

01:15:07.036 --> 01:15:09.038
- Why did you leave her outside?

01:15:09.072 --> 01:15:10.607
She could've been hit by a car.

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:11.975
- I didn't leave her out there.

01:15:12.008 --> 01:15:14.110
I just, I came in and I forgot.

01:15:14.143 --> 01:15:15.078
- But why?

01:15:15.111 --> 01:15:15.945
Why would you leave
her out there at all?

01:15:15.979 --> 01:15:17.113
Didn't you just
take her for a walk?

01:15:17.146 --> 01:15:18.548
- Because I--

01:15:18.582 --> 01:15:20.083
- Did she not take
a dump or something?

01:15:20.116 --> 01:15:20.984
- I don't know.

01:15:21.017 --> 01:15:22.185
We were just getting
back from the walk

01:15:22.218 --> 01:15:24.554
and my mom called so I let
her out in the yard and then,

01:15:24.588 --> 01:15:25.989
I don't know--

01:15:26.022 --> 01:15:27.290
I thought you didn't
talk to your mom tonight?

01:15:27.323 --> 01:15:29.125
- Well I did, okay,
and I didn't tell you

01:15:29.158 --> 01:15:30.827
because I didn't wanna get
into a big fight about it.

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:32.128
- So you thought you'd
just lie to me instead?

01:15:32.161 --> 01:15:33.096
- Yeah.

01:15:33.129 --> 01:15:34.163
Yeah, to avoid a
screaming match like this?

01:15:34.197 --> 01:15:35.231
Yeah, I did, okay?

01:15:35.264 --> 01:15:37.033
So who cares?

01:15:37.066 --> 01:15:38.167
I mean Jesus.

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:45.675
(shouting in the distance)

01:15:45.709 --> 01:15:48.812
- Is this shit gonna
go on all night?

01:15:52.816 --> 01:15:53.650
- So?

01:15:54.918 --> 01:15:57.821
I forgot about her
for like a minute.

01:15:57.854 --> 01:15:59.322
It's not like you've
never done it before.

01:15:59.355 --> 01:16:02.025
- What is going on with you?

01:16:02.058 --> 01:16:05.061
I feel like completely
abandoned right now.

01:16:05.094 --> 01:16:07.030
- I left the dog outside.

01:16:07.063 --> 01:16:08.364
She didn't die.

01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:10.366
She probably had
a grand old time--

01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:12.636
- It's the dog, it's
ditching me when

01:16:12.669 --> 01:16:13.703
your friends come over.

01:16:13.737 --> 01:16:14.570
It's,

01:16:15.939 --> 01:16:18.107
you don't give a shit
about me anymore, you know?

01:16:18.141 --> 01:16:19.943
And it's obvious.

01:16:19.976 --> 01:16:22.045
And it's the fucking beets.

01:16:22.078 --> 01:16:24.080
How could you forget
about my fucking beets

01:16:24.113 --> 01:16:25.214
when you know how
much I love them?

01:16:25.248 --> 01:16:27.684
- Oh, would you drop
the fucking beets?

01:16:27.717 --> 01:16:29.085
Do you have any idea
how petty you sound?

01:16:29.118 --> 01:16:30.253
- Yes, yes!

01:16:31.254 --> 01:16:33.056
I am well aware of
how petty I sound.

01:16:33.089 --> 01:16:35.158
You've reduced me to
nagging you about beets

01:16:35.191 --> 01:16:37.961
and I fucking hate
myself for it.

01:16:37.994 --> 01:16:39.395
I don't know how else
to get through to you.

01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:40.229
- Don't, then.

01:16:40.263 --> 01:16:41.330
Don't bother.

01:16:42.766 --> 01:16:45.769
- What the fuck has
happened to you?

01:16:47.236 --> 01:16:50.940
And you are like totally
fucked up right now.

01:16:50.974 --> 01:16:53.810
- What are you, a
fucking cop now?

01:16:57.146 --> 01:17:00.083
- And you know what else it is?

01:17:00.116 --> 01:17:01.417
You haven't lifted
one fucking finger

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:02.351
to help with the wedding.

01:17:02.385 --> 01:17:04.153
What did your mom say anyway?

01:17:04.187 --> 01:17:05.822
- What does it matter?

01:17:05.855 --> 01:17:06.656
- Oh no.

01:17:06.690 --> 01:17:08.157
No, no, no.

01:17:08.191 --> 01:17:09.826
Don't give me that sullen
10-year-old bit you play

01:17:09.859 --> 01:17:10.760
with your mom.

01:17:10.794 --> 01:17:12.228
We're not doing that tonight.

01:17:12.261 --> 01:17:14.097
- You know what,
it doesn't matter.

01:17:14.130 --> 01:17:15.999
We're not fucking
getting married.

01:17:16.032 --> 01:17:16.866
- Oh.

01:17:17.934 --> 01:17:18.935
Oh.

01:17:18.968 --> 01:17:20.837
So, that's how it's gonna be?

01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:23.439
You're just calling the
whole thing off now?

01:17:23.472 --> 01:17:25.208
You're gonna quit
on your baby too?

01:17:25.241 --> 01:17:26.676
- No, I didn't say that.

01:17:26.710 --> 01:17:27.911
I just,

01:17:27.944 --> 01:17:28.945
I just don't know why
we're in such a rush

01:17:28.978 --> 01:17:29.879
to get married.

01:17:29.913 --> 01:17:31.748
It's not like that baby cares.

01:17:31.781 --> 01:17:34.083
- My family cares.

01:17:34.117 --> 01:17:35.719
I care.

01:17:35.752 --> 01:17:37.286
I thought we were in love, Cary.

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:38.722
Isn't that why you asked me?

01:17:38.755 --> 01:17:40.389
Wasn't this your idea?

01:17:42.826 --> 01:17:44.828
You knocked me up, Cary.

01:17:44.861 --> 01:17:49.032
You're supposed to make
an honest woman out of me.

01:17:51.467 --> 01:17:54.237
Come on, you're supposed
to teach me bass, remember?

01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:58.274
So we can quit life together
and go be in a band.

01:17:58.307 --> 01:18:01.310
Our baby's gonna learn
to play drums, remember?

01:18:01.344 --> 01:18:03.012
We're gonna live out of the
back of a van and change

01:18:03.046 --> 01:18:06.315
the baby's diapers
at truck stops.

01:18:06.349 --> 01:18:08.184
(people shouting)
Shut up!

01:18:08.217 --> 01:18:09.919
Shut the fuck up!

01:18:09.953 --> 01:18:11.354
Shut the fuck up!

01:18:12.488 --> 01:18:14.290
Shut the fuck up!

01:18:14.323 --> 01:18:15.959
Shut the fuck up!

01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:18.294
Shut up!

01:18:21.965 --> 01:18:24.133
(sobbing)

01:18:28.838 --> 01:18:31.240
(slow music)

01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:46.222
(sobbing)

01:18:47.356 --> 01:18:49.759
(slow music)

01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:56.099
What are you doing?

01:18:56.132 --> 01:18:58.902
- What does it look
like I'm doing?

01:18:58.935 --> 01:19:01.004
- You're really gonna leave?

01:19:01.037 --> 01:19:02.205
Just like that?

01:19:02.238 --> 01:19:03.372
- Yeah.

01:19:03.406 --> 01:19:04.841
Just like that.

01:19:07.911 --> 01:19:09.745
- Where are you going?

01:19:10.413 --> 01:19:11.981
What are you doing?

01:19:12.015 --> 01:19:12.916
- I don't know.

01:19:12.949 --> 01:19:14.383
I'm gonna hail a cab, I guess.

01:19:14.417 --> 01:19:15.318
- What is this?

01:19:15.351 --> 01:19:16.886
What's going on?

01:19:18.587 --> 01:19:20.857
Why were they calling
you Scary Cary?

01:19:20.890 --> 01:19:22.091
- Who?

01:19:22.125 --> 01:19:23.559
- The dipshits on
the backstairs.

01:19:23.592 --> 01:19:24.928
They were calling
you Scary Cary.

01:19:24.961 --> 01:19:26.162
Did you go up
there or something?

01:19:26.195 --> 01:19:27.363
- What, no?

01:19:27.396 --> 01:19:29.265
No, I didn't go up.

01:19:29.298 --> 01:19:31.801
I don't know why they were
calling me Scary Cary.

01:19:31.835 --> 01:19:34.203
Maybe because they
fucking hate us.

01:19:34.237 --> 01:19:35.304
Probably 'cause we're
yelling at each other

01:19:35.338 --> 01:19:36.539
all the goddamn time.

01:19:36.572 --> 01:19:39.008
- How else am I supposed
to get your attention?

01:19:39.042 --> 01:19:40.877
- Maybe act like
you're a friend,

01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:43.279
instead of a goddamn
lunatic all the time.

01:19:43.312 --> 01:19:47.283
- You don't need a friend,
Cary, you need a mommy.

01:19:48.952 --> 01:19:51.955
(people chattering)

01:19:53.322 --> 01:19:55.191
Well go, go already.

01:20:05.902 --> 01:20:08.171
Well what are you gonna do?

01:20:10.273 --> 01:20:11.174
Stay or go?

01:20:15.444 --> 01:20:19.248
I am buying a house for
us and for the baby.

01:20:19.282 --> 01:20:23.452
And no, you can't just rent
a room you fucking idiot.

01:20:24.487 --> 01:20:25.889
I want you there.

01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:29.292
We want you there.

01:20:30.559 --> 01:20:32.896
But not if you're gonna be
a fucking child about it.

01:20:32.929 --> 01:20:33.930
- [Party Goers] Nine,

01:20:33.963 --> 01:20:34.998
eight,

01:20:35.031 --> 01:20:36.332
seven...
- Come on.

01:20:39.035 --> 01:20:41.437
Grow the fuck up already.

01:20:41.470 --> 01:20:42.605
- [Partiers] One.

01:20:42.638 --> 01:20:44.073
Happy New Year!

01:20:45.574 --> 01:20:49.946
(cheering)
(shouting)

01:20:52.481 --> 01:20:55.484
* I am not over you

01:20:58.387 --> 01:21:01.090
* Being over me

01:21:02.591 --> 01:21:05.594
* I am not over you

01:21:09.098 --> 01:21:11.567
* Being over me

01:21:13.970 --> 01:21:17.140
(slow acoustic music)

01:21:29.218 --> 01:21:33.056
* A mother calls to her child

01:21:34.323 --> 01:21:38.494
* He brazenly remains
on the swing sets

01:21:46.402 --> 01:21:50.573
* She recalls those
formative years

01:21:52.441 --> 01:21:56.412
* When he clinged so
tight to her pant leg

01:22:04.587 --> 01:22:08.424
* I'm holding everything back

01:22:10.459 --> 01:22:14.630
* I can't let you get
the best of me again

01:22:22.705 --> 01:22:27.010
* In my head I'm packing my bags

01:22:28.511 --> 01:22:32.681
* But I won't get up
from this park bench

01:22:41.157 --> 01:22:44.160
* I am not over you

01:22:47.063 --> 01:22:49.532
* Being over me

01:22:52.101 --> 01:22:55.104
* I am not over you

01:22:58.141 --> 01:23:00.543
* Being over me

01:23:02.745 --> 01:23:05.748
* I am not over you

01:23:08.584 --> 01:23:11.487
* Being over me

01:23:17.593 --> 01:23:21.430
* The subtle roll of the eyes

01:23:23.366 --> 01:23:27.536
* When I can't find
my car keys again

01:23:35.611 --> 01:23:39.348
* That almost inaudible sigh

01:23:41.484 --> 01:23:45.654
* When I retell your
jokes to your friends

01:23:55.598 --> 01:23:59.568
(acoustic orchestral
indie music)

01:24:15.551 --> 01:24:18.554
* I am not over you

01:24:21.557 --> 01:24:24.227
* Being over me

01:24:26.562 --> 01:24:29.565
* I am not over you

01:24:32.668 --> 01:24:35.338
* Being over me

01:24:37.573 --> 01:24:41.744
(acoustic orchestral
indie music)
