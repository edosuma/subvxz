Are you lost?

00:14.098 --> 00:15.213

to live there.

00:15.349 --> 00:16.930
Well, we live here now.

Liber8 has three
possible bombing targets.

00:34.952 --> 00:36.658

00:41.792 --> 00:43.578

and lock down your gear.

one hell of a ride.

00:52.845 --> 00:55.587
Greg, are you still
with Mr. Sadler?

00:55.681 --> 00:57.296
He's just about
to speak. Why?

00:57.433 --> 01:00.470
CPS just got word
that Liber8 is going
to hit a high value target.

01:00.603 --> 01:02.639
/ am worried
SadTech could be it.

could get in here.

01:51.612 --> 01:52.727
Thank you, Sonya.

01:54.448 --> 01:57.861
Your loyalty to Travis
is inspiring to me.

02:00.121 --> 02:01.361
Thank you.

02:02.540 --> 02:04.531
You could be
forgiven otherwise.

02:11.215 --> 02:13.046
My loyalty to Travis

02:13.134 --> 02:16.592
is second only to mine
for you and our cause.

02:22.560 --> 02:24.096
I'll be in shortly.

02:28.524 --> 02:30.230
What are your
orders, Edouard?

02:31.444 --> 02:33.560
Due to the Protector's
presence here,

02:37.616 --> 02:39.356
By about 60 years.

02:40.036 --> 02:42.368
Our goals are
still the same.

02:42.455 --> 02:44.366
The Corporate Congress
may not yet exist,

02:44.457 --> 02:47.290
but its seeds
have been planted.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.497
We will ensure
it never grows.

02:50.880 --> 02:55.590
We will do this by
inspiring a new generation
to take up our cause

02:55.676 --> 02:57.507
and undermine
the very foundations

02:57.595 --> 02:59.426
that the Congress
will be built on.

03:00.389 --> 03:03.927
We will not do this
through open confrontation.

03:04.935 --> 03:06.345
We are still at war...

03:06.437 --> 03:08.098
A war we will never win

03:08.189 --> 03:10.851
unless we fight it
on the enemy's terms.

03:10.941 --> 03:14.399
We don't need guns to
transform the world.

03:14.487 --> 03:17.775
We have the knowledge
of what will happen

03:17.865 --> 03:19.981
and the power to
imagine better.

03:22.411 --> 03:24.117
You're a good soldier.

03:24.372 --> 03:27.284
In my absence, you did
what you thought was best.

03:27.375 --> 03:31.414
You kept our people together
and most of them alive.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.246
But now,

03:35.841 --> 03:37.581
from this point forward,

03:37.676 --> 03:40.008
instead of force
to win our battles,

03:40.096 --> 03:42.428
we use strategy
and knowledge.

03:43.808 --> 03:45.764
How do we begin?
By securing our position.

03:46.060 --> 03:47.266

03:47.436 --> 03:49.222

from C3.

07:41.712 --> 07:43.919
Someone very
powerful did this.

07:44.006 --> 07:47.248
You should take
a look at the bruising
around her mouth and chin.

How powerful?

07:50.012 --> 07:52.253
Mmm... Speculating,

07:52.348 --> 07:54.930
she was grabbed by
the throat like so,

07:55.059 --> 07:57.801
lifted off her feet,
straight up, one hand,

07:57.895 --> 07:59.601
then dumped here.

08:00.272 --> 08:02.058
Credit cards and money
still in her wallet.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.355
So it's not a robbery.

interrupted them.

that kind of brute strength

08:46.110 --> 08:47.771

the description
of Travis.

08:48.237 --> 08:49.522
I'm assuming
that's why we're here,

08:49.613 --> 08:50.773
because you have
some sort of a lead

08:50.864 --> 08:52.024
that connects
this to our gang?

08:53.867 --> 08:55.528
Lily Jones was
the name of a witness

08:55.619 --> 08:58.861
in a case that Section 6
was building against Liber8.

08:58.956 --> 09:00.742
The case fell apart.

She recanted
and when pressed
to testify, she ran.

09:05.129 --> 09:06.790
She just disappeared?

09:07.131 --> 09:10.544
Yeah. Her identity
was kept a secret
and her files were sealed.

09:11.719 --> 09:13.960
So you are actually
checking for identifying
marks over there.

09:19.143 --> 09:23.512
My Lily has a butterfly tattoo
on the inside of
one of her wrists.

09:23.647 --> 09:25.387
Wait, hold on,
your Lily?

09:25.482 --> 09:26.938
You actually know her?

09:27.192 --> 09:28.477
No.

09:28.610 --> 09:30.316
Of her.
We never met.

09:33.031 --> 09:35.408

either a robbery
gone wrong,

09:35.492 --> 09:37.824
or this is just
the tip of the iceberg.

09:39.371 --> 09:41.657
I should call my people,
get an assessment.

09:42.207 --> 09:43.583
Okay, I'll have
units re-canvas the area

09:43.667 --> 09:44.998
and see what we
can come up with

09:45.127 --> 09:46.367
as far as footage
from the cameras.

I understand you've
chosen your own path.

11:37.072 --> 11:40.815
Travis,
continue on the endeavor
we have begun.

11:41.702 --> 11:44.444
That will allow
Matthew and l
time to speak.

11:55.424 --> 11:57.255
Did you steal this?

11:58.051 --> 11:59.632
Nothing so crass.

12:00.971 --> 12:02.302
With just
a little memory recall,

turn a small fortune
in the market.

I don't want anything to do
with your money, Matthew.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.560
Of course not.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.229
But in terms of
funding a full revolution,

12:13.317 --> 12:14.807
it's a pretty good start,
don't you think?

back on the right foot,
where do we start?

before they
find the right one.

it's a coincidence,

12:51.897 --> 12:53.683
or are they really targeting
you through your family?

12:53.815 --> 12:55.897
lwish I knew but...
I got to go.

12:56.026 --> 12:58.859
Hey, so Betty is tracking
down all of the Lily Joneses
in the area.

12:58.987 --> 13:00.693
(MOBILE BEEPS)
Should have
word back soon.

13:04.576 --> 13:06.032
Ready to go?

13:06.662 --> 13:08.527
I'm gonna have to catch up.

13:12.876 --> 13:14.616
Have you found a solution?

13:14.711 --> 13:17.453
Yes, this is a DNA
testing kitwe can use

13:17.547 --> 13:19.083
to be definite
about the results.

13:19.716 --> 13:21.581
Lucas will modify it
to be instantaneous.

13:21.718 --> 13:24.551
But we still need
an original tissue sample
for a baseline.

13:24.888 --> 13:25.923
I'll get it.

13:26.014 --> 13:27.174
No. Sonya will go.

13:27.724 --> 13:29.885
Take Garza,
get what you need.

13:31.687 --> 13:33.552
(SlGHS)
What, no hello?

13:34.398 --> 13:37.140
The last time I
met you here you were
carrying a live grenade.

13:37.234 --> 13:39.020
Then, we almost got
blown up by a mine.

13:39.111 --> 13:41.102
So forgive me for
not being polite.

13:41.238 --> 13:42.978
I'm exciting to be around,
what can I say?

13:43.073 --> 13:44.734
So this is
a Kevlar optional affair?

13:45.117 --> 13:46.823
Foryou.
Not for your ancestors.

13:47.911 --> 13:50.072
ljust met with Kagame.
The danger is real.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.945
They're going
after your grandmother.

13:52.082 --> 13:54.573
I already know that.
Why?

13:55.002 --> 13:56.958
Well, to get rid
of you for starters.

13:57.087 --> 13:58.543
And it's all your fault.

13:58.630 --> 14:00.962
You had to threaten Lucas
with killing his grandparents.

14:01.091 --> 14:02.752
That got them all
going about
what might happen

14:02.843 --> 14:04.504
if one of our
ancestors were killed.

14:04.594 --> 14:07.381
And now Kagame,
he wants to try
a grand experiment

14:07.472 --> 14:09.178
to test our
paradoxical vulnerability.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.097
Cupcake?

14:11.935 --> 14:13.641
So that makes me what?

14:13.770 --> 14:15.180
The guinea pig?

14:15.272 --> 14:16.432
Squeak, squeak.

14:17.649 --> 14:19.480
How'd they even know
my grandmother's name?

14:20.027 --> 14:21.608
Kagame, he has his ways.

14:22.446 --> 14:24.812
But why would he
have that information
about my family?

14:25.532 --> 14:26.817
Hell if I know.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.820
Look,
I don't know
all the details

14:29.911 --> 14:31.651
about how our
escape was arranged,

14:31.788 --> 14:34.450
but I do know that
the guards were in on it.

14:36.460 --> 14:38.826
Who knows how high
the conspiracy went?

14:39.254 --> 14:41.540
Maybe whoever arranged it

14:43.050 --> 14:44.415
told him.

14:45.677 --> 14:49.261
So you're telling me
that I might be
here for a reason?

14:50.223 --> 14:51.679
Part of some
bigger plan?

14:51.767 --> 14:54.804
Given what's happened,
does anything seem
too far-fetched to you?

14:59.066 --> 15:02.433
What? lfyou think I
have ulterior motives,
join me on my yacht tonight.

15:02.652 --> 15:03.858
How about lunch?

15:04.863 --> 15:06.023
Deal.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.439
Thanks for the lunch.

15:09.701 --> 15:11.612
You can pick up
the check.

15:15.624 --> 15:16.864
Carlos.

15:17.084 --> 15:19.621
Yeah, look,
I spoke with my contact
at Section 6.

15:19.711 --> 15:21.292
They confirmed that the gang
is going after our witness

15:21.379 --> 15:22.755
and that she's in town.

15:22.839 --> 15:24.124
So they killed
the wrong girl.

15:24.216 --> 15:26.673
And they're just
gonna keep going
until they get the right one.

15:26.760 --> 15:29.342
Okay, then we need to
round up all the Lily Joneses
in the lower mainland,

15:29.429 --> 15:30.589
put them in
protective custody.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.341
Here you go, sir.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.301
Can we get it done?

15:34.893 --> 15:36.349
Well, we don't
have a choice.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.471
Thanks.

15:38.730 --> 15:40.061
(EXCLAIMS IN PAIN)

15:42.275 --> 15:43.481
Hey!

15:44.778 --> 15:45.858
Hey!

15:54.121 --> 15:55.531
(PANTING)

16:00.961 --> 16:03.077
Sorry, I'm late.
Where's...

16:04.506 --> 16:06.838
What the hell
happened to you?

16:07.467 --> 16:08.627
Bike messenger.

16:08.718 --> 16:10.583
I stepped out on the street,
and I didn't even see him.

16:10.846 --> 16:12.837
You kidding me?
Are you okay?
Yeah.

16:12.931 --> 16:14.262
What do you got?

16:14.349 --> 16:15.384
Uh...

16:15.851 --> 16:17.557
Well, I had Samantha
look up all the Lily Joneses

16:17.644 --> 16:19.350
in our age range.

16:19.437 --> 16:22.679
There's eight of them,
nine if you
count our dead girl.

16:22.816 --> 16:23.851
We've got their addresses.

16:23.942 --> 16:25.557
I've sent units
to their homes,
but it is daytime

16:25.652 --> 16:27.313
so they could be
at work or school.

16:27.737 --> 16:29.068
But at least
we've got some leads.

16:29.197 --> 16:30.858
We can cover more ground
if we split up.

16:31.199 --> 16:32.484
That's a good idea.

16:32.576 --> 16:33.691
Okay, I'll
requisition you a cruiser.

16:33.785 --> 16:34.900
Thanks.

16:46.590 --> 16:48.831
They're like drones,

16:48.925 --> 16:51.883
blissfully unaware
they're being
trained into subservience.

16:52.929 --> 16:55.261
Well, those that seek
the truth will find it.

16:55.724 --> 16:58.010
This has been programmed
for the Protector's DNA.

16:58.101 --> 17:00.513
You can use it to
match with the girls'.

17:00.854 --> 17:04.346
You think she's
going to just sit there
while I perform your test?

17:05.025 --> 17:06.606
Then kill her first.

17:06.902 --> 17:09.359
That's not what
Kagame wants.

17:11.781 --> 17:13.362
Why are you so sure
one of the Lilys is here?

17:13.450 --> 17:15.361
ljust know.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.446
You've searched her before,
haven't you?

17:17.537 --> 17:19.448
You've googled
your grandmother.

17:19.581 --> 17:22.197
I knew that she lived
here for a little while.

17:22.292 --> 17:25.329
So I looked up the names
and some of the data.

17:25.462 --> 17:30.331
This woman,
she's exactly like my mom
said her mother was.

17:30.926 --> 17:32.837
She's smart,
she's intelligent,

17:32.928 --> 17:34.338
she's involved
in the community.

17:35.180 --> 17:36.966
You've been stalking her.

17:38.266 --> 17:39.426
Maybe.

17:39.517 --> 17:41.599
What are you going to do?
You just gonna
walk up to her and say,

17:41.686 --> 17:43.472
"Hello, I'm your
future granddaughter"?

17:44.773 --> 17:46.479
Wait, there she is.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.651
Um, I got to go!

17:49.152 --> 17:51.017
There you are.
Here I am.

17:51.154 --> 17:52.610
And then I guess he
got a little upset
about that...

17:52.697 --> 17:54.153
KIERA: Lillian Jones?

17:55.158 --> 17:57.365

18:01.831 --> 18:03.492
Yeah, I'll see ya later.

18:05.335 --> 18:06.666
Miss Jones,
your life is in danger.

18:09.339 --> 18:11.079
Dad's waiting
for us to start.
Let's go.

18:11.174 --> 18:12.960
Uh,yeah,
about that, um...

18:13.051 --> 18:15.167
I'm gonna have to
take a pass
on the meeting today.

18:16.012 --> 18:17.422
I'm in the middle of
something really big.

18:19.099 --> 18:20.555
What, and you
think Dad isn't?

18:21.434 --> 18:23.720
Honestly? What Roland does
kind of gives me the creeps.

18:24.354 --> 18:26.140
So, ifyou'll excuse me
I have more
important things to do

18:26.231 --> 18:28.347
than sit around
with a bunch of
conspiracy freaks

18:28.441 --> 18:29.851
wearing tin foil hats.

18:30.527 --> 18:31.937
Whoa! Whoa, hold on.
Wait!

18:33.363 --> 18:36.230
You're always going on
about how important
whatever you do is.

18:36.408 --> 18:37.818
Like you're saving
the frickin' world
or something.

18:37.909 --> 18:39.820
How 'bout spending
a little more time
with your family, huh?

18:39.911 --> 18:41.367
You're not my family.

18:41.454 --> 18:44.287
This whole grass roots
activism of yours isn't
changing the world.

18:44.374 --> 18:45.784
It's a joke.

18:45.875 --> 18:48.708
You want to change the world,
you got to leave
the living room first.

18:52.924 --> 18:55.040
We may not be
a real family, Alec,

18:55.885 --> 18:58.217
but we're
the closest thing
you've got.

19:02.559 --> 19:05.175
And you're saying
terrorists are
killing women with my name

19:05.270 --> 19:06.885
and you can't
give me specifics?

19:06.980 --> 19:08.140
No.

19:08.231 --> 19:09.311
I think I might lose it.

19:09.399 --> 19:11.105
Please try and
stay calm.

19:11.735 --> 19:12.975
What do I do?

19:13.069 --> 19:15.185
Well, if you come with me,
I'll take you into custody,

19:15.739 --> 19:17.479
get you somewhere safe.

19:17.741 --> 19:19.072
Okay.

that a Lily Jones was
involved in an incident.

19:40.138 --> 19:41.298
An incident?

19:41.389 --> 19:42.595
Yeah, an assault
of some sort.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.138
Details are
pretty sketchy.
Where?

19:44.267 --> 19:46.599
Broadway and Granville.
They've got
the assailant, too.

19:46.811 --> 19:47.926
Tell them to use
extreme caution.

19:48.021 --> 19:49.101
Way ahead ofyou.

19:49.272 --> 19:50.933
Look, I'm leaving
the precinct now.

19:51.024 --> 19:53.561
You go and get Lily,
l'll deal with the assailant.

19:56.654 --> 19:59.612
You're at one of
the best universities
in the country.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.781
Your parents
must be very proud.

20:01.910 --> 20:03.775
Yeah, they are.
(CHUCKLES)

20:09.751 --> 20:13.289
They wouldn't be
named Jim and Alison
by any chance, would they?

20:15.048 --> 20:16.128
No.

20:16.466 --> 20:18.047
Kevin and Eve.

20:31.106 --> 20:32.892
Miss Jones.
I'm gonna need
you to come with me.

20:32.982 --> 20:34.313
Is this a joke?

20:34.442 --> 20:36.228
Uh, this is the victim.

20:36.611 --> 20:38.317
That's Lily Jones.

20:40.323 --> 20:41.312
Let's go!

20:41.783 --> 20:43.319
Get me the hell
out of here!

20:43.743 --> 20:44.778
Shit!

20:54.838 --> 20:56.169
Let's go!

get a tetanus shot.

21:01.010 --> 21:01.999
Thanks.

Are you done
eyeing me up?

21:08.017 --> 21:09.882
Are your parents'
names Jim and Alison?

21:10.645 --> 21:12.351
Did they send you
to come get me?
'Cause I'm not going.

21:12.480 --> 21:13.720
And you can't make me.
I'm emancipated.

21:13.857 --> 21:15.813
And that girl owed me money.
l was just trying to collect.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.481
I don't owe you anything,
you delinquent.

21:18.027 --> 21:19.016

21:19.112 --> 21:20.318
You can't arrest me
for a misunderstanding.

21:20.697 --> 21:22.187
I'm not arresting you.

21:22.323 --> 21:24.154
Then let me go.
No, you need to
come with me

21:24.242 --> 21:25.982
because your
life is in danger.

more than smoke a joint.

getting better.

killing women
named Lily Jones.

She's Lily Jones.

to the station
for your own protection.

you weren't going to
arrest me!

in a unique club.

you get chased by a terrorist.

It's very Terminator.
Shut up.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.359

trying to make the best
out of a bad situation.

know a bad situation

if it bit you on
your Dolce & Gabbanas.

22:20.089 --> 22:21.625
I'd rather take
my chances
against terrorists

22:21.716 --> 22:22.876
than sit here
listening to her.

22:22.967 --> 22:24.002
Just let me out anywhere.

22:24.093 --> 22:25.344
Not until you're both safe.

you aren't the danger?

22:27.764 --> 22:30.927

You could just be some
psycho kidnapping us.

going to be fine.

letting you out of this car
until we get to the Precinct.

38:14.710 --> 38:16.075
It's going to be okay.

38:17.004 --> 38:18.540
There's an ambulance
on its way.

38:19.173 --> 38:20.538
(MADDIE SOBBING)

38:20.757 --> 38:23.043
Ambulance is coming, okay?
Just stay...

38:23.343 --> 38:26.335
Don't die, don't die,
don't die, don't die!

38:26.430 --> 38:28.386
Don't die.
Listen, stay with me,
stay with me!

38:29.266 --> 38:30.881
(GRUNTS IN FRUSTRATION)
Stay awake!

38:32.561 --> 38:33.767
Hey...

38:46.200 --> 38:48.031
You're still alive.

38:49.745 --> 38:51.610
You think I care
about that?

38:53.415 --> 38:55.781
The ambulance is
on its way...

39:01.256 --> 39:02.757
(SNIFFLING)

39:04.760 --> 39:06.466
(WEEPING)

39:08.764 --> 39:10.800
Come here.
It's okay.

39:32.996 --> 39:34.202
Kiera!

39:34.790 --> 39:35.950
Sam!

39:36.124 --> 39:37.284
Dad!

39:38.460 --> 39:39.620
Hey, buddy.

39:39.711 --> 39:40.746
Where have you been?

39:40.837 --> 39:42.793
Sadler changed
the location of our meeting
at the last minute.

39:42.881 --> 39:45.122
He wouldn't let me tell you
for security reasons.

39:45.717 --> 39:48.049
We left SadTech
20 minutes
before the blast.

39:48.136 --> 39:49.967
I tried to call
but communications
were down...

39:50.055 --> 39:52.296
Don't you ever
disappear like that again.

39:52.683 --> 39:54.548
If I ever lost you...

39:55.143 --> 39:56.474
(SOBBING)

40:00.649 --> 40:02.185
Jake can do his
graphic design anywhere,

40:02.317 --> 40:04.979
so as long as this new place
has Internet access...

40:06.321 --> 40:08.186
You take care of her.

40:10.158 --> 40:11.284
Bye.

40:11.410 --> 40:12.525
Bye.

40:16.331 --> 40:18.037
Thank you, Kellog.

40:19.543 --> 40:21.158
I appreciate this.

40:22.170 --> 40:23.671
See you soon.

40:45.861 --> 40:48.102
You know,
Kellog is going to
cash in this favor.

40:48.196 --> 40:49.527
KIERA:
/ can handle Kellog.

40:50.407 --> 40:52.022
The bullet that
killed Maddie,

40:52.451 --> 40:54.316
according to
Kagame’s experiment,

40:54.411 --> 40:55.947
it should have
killed Kellog as well.

40:56.038 --> 40:57.118
Why didn't it?

40:57.205 --> 40:58.581
That's precisely
the problem.

40:58.874 --> 41:00.956
If Kellog had
died or disappeared
when Maddie was killed,

41:01.043 --> 41:02.908
then we would
have definitive proof
that this timeline

41:03.045 --> 41:04.205
is connected to
the one you left.

41:05.047 --> 41:06.628
So, what does this prove?

41:06.715 --> 41:08.626
(SIGHS)
Unfortunately nothing.

41:09.051 --> 41:12.088
Maybe Maddie wasn't
Kellog's
biological grandmother.

41:12.179 --> 41:14.135
Maybe you are on
a new timeline,

41:14.222 --> 41:16.178
or maybe you aren't
and there is no paradox.

41:16.266 --> 41:17.346
I don't know.

41:17.434 --> 41:19.265
The absence of proof
isn't proof of anything.

41:19.728 --> 41:22.470
Well, hopefully Kagame
now believes

41:22.564 --> 41:24.304
they can't get to me
through my family.

41:24.941 --> 41:27.227
That’s one less
thing to worry about.

41:31.615 --> 41:35.278
I gave my word.

41:38.830 --> 41:40.115
My word.

41:41.708 --> 41:46.919
You behave like a mad dog
and lwill put you down.

42:47.441 --> 42:48.556
Mom.

42:50.569 --> 42:53.402
I found the necklace.
It was underneath your bed.

42:54.156 --> 42:55.441
Thank you, sweetheart.

42:55.532 --> 42:57.739
It's really old,
isn't it?

42:58.452 --> 43:01.364
Yeah.
My grandmother gave it to me
when l was a little girl.
