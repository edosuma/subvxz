00:03.837 --> 00:05.714
Dad, Gemma's leaving.

00:05.714 --> 00:07.966
Wait, I want
to meet the famous Gemma!

00:09.718 --> 00:11.970
Oh, hey. Hi. Hello.

00:13.055 --> 00:15.182
"I like to be kneaded."
Good one.

00:16.308 --> 00:17.684
Oh, right. Yeah.

00:17.684 --> 00:18.852
Syd and I
are making bread tonight.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.854
Oh, what a great dad.

00:20.854 --> 00:24.107
I'm Gemma.
It's "dough" nice
to finally meet you.

00:25.400 --> 00:26.985
You too. I'm Max.

00:26.985 --> 00:29.154
Syd's been talking
about you nonstop.

00:29.154 --> 00:31.531
Do you really play
in an orchestra
and a rock band?

00:31.531 --> 00:34.910
I used to play in a band
but then I went classical.

00:34.910 --> 00:36.286
You think
rock‐and‐roll is crazy?

00:36.286 --> 00:38.121
You should see
the orchestra
after‐parties.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.706
Oh, yeah.
I always heard

00:39.706 --> 00:41.542
Beethoven was
the first one in the pool.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.043
(both laugh)

00:44.253 --> 00:48.173
Well, I‐I better go.
Great work today,
rock star.

00:49.591 --> 00:52.469
Um, it was nice
meeting you, Max.

00:52.469 --> 00:54.054
You, too, Gemma.

00:56.598 --> 00:57.808
(door closes)

00:57.808 --> 01:00.727
Dad, you have a crush
on my bass teacher!

01:01.645 --> 01:05.399
What? No.
Okay, maybe a little.

01:06.191 --> 01:08.277
Do you think Gemma is,
I don't know, single?

01:08.277 --> 01:10.445
Not sure, but I'm
happy to find out.

01:10.445 --> 01:12.864
No, I could never
ask you to do that.

01:12.864 --> 01:15.659
But when you do, don't say
that you're asking for me.

01:15.659 --> 01:17.035
Don't worry. I won't.

01:17.035 --> 01:19.871
"Dough nice to
finally meet you."
She's so funny.

Hey, Noodle.

Hey, possum.
You excited for your
last game of the season?

02:01.872 --> 02:04.791
Even more excited that
it's my last game as a mascot.

02:04.791 --> 02:07.252
I can't wait to break out
of this hot, furry prison.

02:08.420 --> 02:10.339
Wow, I can't believe
my grandma is not

02:10.339 --> 02:12.090
going to be
a possum anymore...

02:13.258 --> 02:15.260
are words not a lot
of kids get to say.

02:16.303 --> 02:19.181
Well, gotta go.
Take a good mental picture

02:19.181 --> 02:20.682
and then
it's goodbye forever.

02:25.395 --> 02:28.357
By the way, I'm not
just a print model,
I also do runway.

02:38.075 --> 02:39.743
Hey, Syd, what's going on?

02:39.743 --> 02:41.411
I need your help.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.413
My dad met Gemma

02:43.413 --> 02:46.083
and completely melted
into a love puddle,

02:46.083 --> 02:47.584
and I think she
might like him back.

02:47.584 --> 02:51.505
Mr. R's in love?
They grow up so fast.

02:51.505 --> 02:54.925
So I told my dad I'd find out
if Gemma's single,

02:54.925 --> 02:56.259
but I need to ask
in a subtle way

02:56.259 --> 02:58.679
so she doesn't know
he wants to know.

02:58.679 --> 03:02.099
Oh, what if I find out
whether she has a boyfriend

03:02.099 --> 03:05.477
by asking her what
I should get my boyfriend
for his birthday?

03:05.477 --> 03:07.354
But you don't have
a boyfriend.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.815
No, but I am
in a long‐term relationship

03:09.815 --> 03:11.900
with my very
active imagination.

03:13.485 --> 03:16.279
I don't know.
It's kind of a crazy idea.

03:16.279 --> 03:18.156
(doorbell rings)

03:18.156 --> 03:20.158
But that's Gemma,
so let's go with crazy.

03:22.244 --> 03:24.287
‐Hi, Syd.
‐Hey, Gemma.

03:24.287 --> 03:25.580
‐This is Olive.
‐What's up, Olive?

03:27.541 --> 03:29.918
I was just dropping by
to get Syd's advice

03:29.918 --> 03:32.629
on what b‐day gift to get
to get my boyfriend, Baxter.

03:32.629 --> 03:34.798
We met during a fire drill

03:34.798 --> 03:37.217
and he said the only thing
aflame was his heart.

03:38.176 --> 03:41.638
Wow. I mean,
what a cute story.

03:42.931 --> 03:45.767
Anyway, we could use
an expert here, Gemma.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.727
Have you ever been
in a relationship

03:47.727 --> 03:50.605

03:50.605 --> 03:52.357
I had a boyfriend
when I was living in Italy,

03:52.357 --> 03:54.860
but we broke up
when I moved here last year.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.403
I'm single now.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.280
Yes, that's perfect!

03:59.531 --> 04:01.450
For Baxter.

04:02.868 --> 04:05.287
Yeah, I'll get him
Italian cooking lessons

04:05.287 --> 04:06.788
for his birthday.
Thanks, Gemma.

04:06.788 --> 04:08.081
No problem.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.417
Well, I gotta get to Baxter's.

He hates when
we're apart this long.

Max, the ice cream
truck broke down

04:23.513 --> 04:25.807
and they're giving it
all away before it melts.

04:25.807 --> 04:27.142
If we don't take
advantage of this,

04:27.142 --> 04:28.393

04:29.895 --> 04:31.646
Dang, I wish I could,

04:31.646 --> 04:33.940
but I got to wait
for my science tutor.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.776
Since when do
you have a tutor?

04:35.776 --> 04:37.444
Since he's failing science.

04:38.987 --> 04:41.740
I hired a ninth grader
to help him pass his next test.

04:41.740 --> 04:44.117
Miss Reynolds, I'm hurt.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.869
Why wouldn't you
hire me to tutor Max?

04:45.869 --> 04:47.871
Because when you
tutored him in math,

04:47.871 --> 04:50.165
you guys spent the
whole lesson trying
to spell "tushy"

04:50.165 --> 04:51.458
on the calculator.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.418

Oh, and who is
this little fella?

05:21.488 --> 05:25.075
‐It's a laptop.
‐You're into computers?

05:25.075 --> 05:27.202
I'm a big computer

05:27.202 --> 05:29.496
What model
are you working with?

05:29.496 --> 05:32.332
It's a Danielle original.
I built it from spare parts.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.668
‐You built it yourself?
‐Yeah.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.503
I even coded
a little turtle icon

05:36.503 --> 05:38.839
to do the MC Gavel dance
whenever I turn it on.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.423
I love MC Gavel.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.059
Max, mind if
I go wash up?

05:53.812 --> 05:55.355
Who can say no to that?

06:02.529 --> 06:04.656

I'm standing in an oven...

06:06.908 --> 06:09.578
that's in a sauna
that's in the desert.

06:11.454 --> 06:12.873
At least you get
to go cool off

06:12.873 --> 06:13.957
with some of
that ice cream.

06:13.957 --> 06:15.542
Who needs ice cream?

06:16.418 --> 06:18.879
Maxwell, I'm in love.

06:22.924 --> 06:24.342
Hey, Grandma.

06:24.342 --> 06:26.720
What happened?
I thought you were
giving up the possum suit?

06:26.720 --> 06:29.723
Well, I was grabbing coffee
before the game and I tripped

06:29.723 --> 06:32.601
and out of nowhere
a mystery man caught me.

06:32.601 --> 06:34.352
I didn't see
his face, though,

06:34.352 --> 06:37.105
because this possum nose
fell and covered my eyes.

06:37.105 --> 06:39.566
It's hard being
a single possum
in this city.

06:40.942 --> 06:42.319
So you didn't get his number?

06:42.319 --> 06:44.613
There was no time.
I was late to the game.

06:44.613 --> 06:45.989
What are you going to do?

06:45.989 --> 06:47.365
I'm going to go
to that coffee shop

06:47.365 --> 06:49.075
and wait till
he comes back.

06:49.075 --> 06:51.578
I just hope
I'm the only possum
who's a regular.

06:55.874 --> 06:59.669
Hey, Syd, so how
was your bass lesson?

06:59.669 --> 07:01.296
You have anything to report?
Like, I don't know,

07:01.296 --> 07:03.423
something you found out
about your teacher.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.841
I sure did.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.301
And?

07:06.301 --> 07:08.762
Her cat has two
different colored eyes.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.138
That's it?

07:10.138 --> 07:10.889
Oh, and she's single.

07:10.889 --> 07:12.265
Yes!

07:12.891 --> 07:14.684
You should totally
call her and ask her out.

07:14.684 --> 07:17.854
Now? What if she says no?
What if I scare her away?

07:17.854 --> 07:19.189
Come on, Dad. I mean,

07:19.189 --> 07:21.149
what would you tell me
if I was the one with a crush?

07:21.149 --> 07:23.735
Swallow your feelings forever
to avoid risking embarrassment?

07:24.527 --> 07:26.863
No. Be brave.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.449
Okay. All right.
You're right.

07:32.827 --> 07:35.830
Gemma, hey. Hey,
it's Max Reynolds.

07:35.830 --> 07:39.542
Yes, Sydney's dad.
Uh, anyway, I was calling

07:39.542 --> 07:43.630
because I was wondering
if you're free tomorrow,

07:43.630 --> 07:47.676
if you want to get
coffee with me? And Syd.

07:49.135 --> 07:52.055
Oh, great.
Yeah, will do. 'Kay, bye.

07:53.431 --> 07:56.518
Wait, what happened between
the "with me" and the "and Syd"?

07:56.518 --> 07:57.477
I don't know, I panicked.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.895
I was afraid she was
going to say no.

07:58.895 --> 08:01.940
But the important thing
is we have a date.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.316
Yes, we do.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.276
And Syd, I owe you, okay?

08:05.276 --> 08:07.028
If you ever need me to go
on a date with you, I'm there.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.488
Thanks, Dad.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.864
I'll put that in my back pocket

08:09.864 --> 08:11.408
and then throw away the pants.

08:17.747 --> 08:19.457
Gemma's going to be
here any minute.

08:19.457 --> 08:21.543
How do I look?
Does my hair make
me look short?

08:22.335 --> 08:23.586
Dad, would you calm down?

08:23.586 --> 08:25.130
I'm sorry.
I'm just a little nervous.

08:25.130 --> 08:27.674
I mean, it's been a long time
since I've been on a date.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.467
Relax, Dad,
you're going to do great.

08:29.467 --> 08:31.344
Just promise you'll stay
with me until I'm comfortable.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.680
And if I can't think
of anything to say, jump in.

08:33.680 --> 08:36.641
Got it. But let's come up
with a code word

08:36.641 --> 08:38.059
so I know when to leave.

08:38.059 --> 08:41.688
How about,
I don't know, Picasso?

08:41.688 --> 08:44.858
Brilliant. I don't know
what I would do without you.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.693
You'd have a normal
one‐on‐one date

08:46.693 --> 08:48.028
that didn't strangely
include your daughter?

08:50.405 --> 08:53.700
‐Hey, Max, Syd.
‐Hey, Gemma.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.618
Hi, I got you
an extra special smoothie

08:55.618 --> 08:57.579
because I happen
to know the owner.

08:57.579 --> 08:59.039
<i>Moi.</i>

08:59.039 --> 09:01.708
Well, <i>moi</i>
thanks you very much.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.585
(laughs)

09:08.506 --> 09:09.674
So...

09:12.052 --> 09:13.887
How was your day?

09:13.887 --> 09:17.807
That's a good question.
I was just about to ask that.

09:18.808 --> 09:21.436
Well, I had a rehearsal
for our annual fundraiser

09:21.436 --> 09:22.771
at the modern art museum.

09:22.771 --> 09:24.064
Oh, I love that place.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.648
Did you check out
the exhibit on Picasso?

09:25.648 --> 09:27.358
‐I got to go.
‐What?

09:27.358 --> 09:29.402
No, no.
Did I say Picasso?

09:29.402 --> 09:32.697
I meant Van Gogh.
And speaking of Van Gogh, don't.

09:34.741 --> 09:38.828
So, Max, it's super cool
that you own this place.

09:38.828 --> 09:43.041
Smoothies, yum, bikes, rad,
put them together?

09:43.041 --> 09:44.959
(imitates explosion)

09:44.959 --> 09:46.836
(chuckles) Thanks.
It's so nice of you to say that.

09:50.048 --> 09:51.674
So...

09:52.509 --> 09:56.471
Gemma, you were telling me
about your tour in Costa Rica.

09:56.471 --> 09:59.724
Oh, it was awesome,
except for the ziplining.

09:59.724 --> 10:02.143
Too many birds.
I hate birds.

10:02.143 --> 10:04.354
No, way. I hate birds.

10:05.396 --> 10:07.482
Would you look at that?

10:07.482 --> 10:10.276
You both hate the same
adorable things.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.861
(both chuckle)

10:12.946 --> 10:15.198
Syd, didn't you say
you had something to do?

10:15.198 --> 10:16.950
Oh, but I haven't
finished my‐‐

10:18.868 --> 10:21.037
Oh, got to go, bye.

10:22.247 --> 10:24.082
Boy, when she leaves,
she leaves.

10:26.584 --> 10:31.214
Okay, uh, confession,
I wanted to ask you
on a real date,

10:31.214 --> 10:33.591
but I chickened out
and I made my daughter
come along.

10:33.591 --> 10:36.511
Well, I have
a confession too.

10:36.511 --> 10:38.388
When Syd asked if I was single,

10:38.388 --> 10:41.182
I was hoping that meant
you wanted to ask me out.

10:41.182 --> 10:41.891
Really?

10:42.725 --> 10:44.727
So if I ask you right now

10:44.727 --> 10:46.396
if you wanted to turn
this into a real date,

10:46.396 --> 10:47.856
you'd say yes?

10:47.856 --> 10:48.815
No.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.568
I'd say absolutely.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.828
Well, you look fancy.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.204
Of course I do.

11:03.204 --> 11:05.206
Today marks day one
of my mission

11:05.206 --> 11:07.333
to woo the lovely Danielle.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.627
I'm going to slowly charm her
over these tutoring sessions

11:09.627 --> 11:11.546
until she falls
hopelessly in love

11:11.546 --> 11:13.965
with the man
of her dreams.
That's me.

11:14.757 --> 11:15.842
(knocking)

11:19.679 --> 11:22.056
Hi, Max. Ready to get
your science on?

11:22.056 --> 11:23.391
Oh, hey, Leo.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.351
‐M'lady.
‐(door closes)

11:25.351 --> 11:27.061
I'm not here to intrude.

11:27.061 --> 11:30.106
I just came to watch a shaper
of young minds at work.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.232
Cool.

11:34.861 --> 11:36.321
So, Max,

11:36.321 --> 11:38.656
let's get started with
speed versus velocity.

11:38.656 --> 11:40.450
Before you
nourish your brain,

11:40.450 --> 11:41.993
care to nourish your soul

11:41.993 --> 11:45.163
with some warm
chocolate chip cookies?

11:45.163 --> 11:46.664
Thanks, Leo.

11:46.664 --> 11:48.750
I bought them
from two little girls
having a bake sale

11:48.750 --> 11:51.669
because I always support
female‐owned businesses.

11:52.629 --> 11:54.422
What do you mean always?

11:54.422 --> 11:56.341
We hit those girls
with water balloons last week.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.803
If you know a faster way
to share water on a hot day.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.639
I'd like to hear it.

12:04.140 --> 12:07.393
So Max, the formula
for speed is distance
over time.

12:07.393 --> 12:09.479
Why don't you see if you can
calculate that first problem?

12:11.231 --> 12:13.483
Where's my manners?
Let me get you a napkin.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.526
I think there's one in here.

12:19.489 --> 12:21.366
Hey, how did this

12:21.366 --> 12:23.868
framed article on me
being the founder

12:23.868 --> 12:26.579
and president of the school
computer club get in here?

12:27.956 --> 12:29.874
Wow, you started
a computer club?

12:29.874 --> 12:31.000
That's impressive.

12:32.210 --> 12:35.505
Hey, I finally
spelled it. "Tushy."

12:37.298 --> 12:39.259
It's one of my many honors.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.636
It's a shame all my awards
are too heavy to carry

12:41.636 --> 12:43.930
at the same time.
I'll bring them over

12:43.930 --> 12:45.431
one at a time
for the next few sessions.

12:45.431 --> 12:48.851
Oh, actually,
Miss Reynolds only
hired me through next week

12:48.851 --> 12:50.812
so I can help Max
pass this science test.

12:50.812 --> 12:53.815
Wait! But that's
not enough time!

12:55.066 --> 12:57.986
For Max... to learn.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.406
‐Actually, I'm good,
‐No, you're not.

13:02.865 --> 13:05.576
Am I the only one who cares
about this kid's future?

13:10.290 --> 13:12.417
Okay, I'm done
pretending to do homework.

13:13.251 --> 13:14.585
I've got to know

13:14.585 --> 13:16.587
how things are going
with your dad and Gemma.

13:16.587 --> 13:19.090
Amazing. Ever since
the smoothie date,

13:19.090 --> 13:21.092
they've been seeing
each other all the time.

13:21.092 --> 13:23.177
So when's the wedding?
My May is booked up,

13:23.177 --> 13:25.138
but I have some
openings in June.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.683
Come on, Olive, let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

13:28.683 --> 13:30.435
We have to plan
the proposal first.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.604
‐(Max whistles)
‐Hey, Dad.

13:33.604 --> 13:35.148
Oh, hey, girls.
I didn't see you there.

13:35.148 --> 13:38.109
‐I was just‐‐
‐Floating on a cloud of love?

13:38.109 --> 13:41.404
I'm dying for the deets
on this romance, Mr. R.

13:41.404 --> 13:43.656
So how many total dates
have you and Gemma been on?

13:43.656 --> 13:46.242
Oh, come on, Olive.
Who can count?
Four and a half.

13:47.410 --> 13:49.287
Have you taken
any couples pics yet?

13:49.287 --> 13:50.747
Have I?

13:50.747 --> 13:53.082
(chuckles, clears throat)

13:54.667 --> 13:58.629
Max:
Here we are getting pizza
and biking on the bridge

13:58.629 --> 14:00.715
and in the park having a picnic.

14:00.715 --> 14:03.551
And when a bird
swooped down on our picnic.

14:05.887 --> 14:08.389
Aw, have you ever seen
a cuter couple?

14:08.389 --> 14:09.891
Not since me and Baxter.

14:09.891 --> 14:11.934
‐Who's Baxter?
‐Don't go there.

14:12.977 --> 14:14.604
So are you two
going out again tonight?

14:14.604 --> 14:15.855
No, we have lives.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.732
We can't see each other
every night.

14:17.732 --> 14:19.317
(phone buzzes)

14:19.317 --> 14:21.069
Oh, hey, it's Gemma
asking if I'm free tonight.

14:21.069 --> 14:22.570
Better go change!

14:25.364 --> 14:28.242
Wow, I love seeing
my dad so happy.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.203
Totally, it's adorable.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.164
He's like a middle schooler.
Does that ever go away?

14:33.164 --> 14:35.208
Max: Girls, help!
I want to look cute,

14:35.208 --> 14:37.335
but not like
I'm trying too hard.

14:37.335 --> 14:39.921
Yup. Eighth grade's forever.

14:42.924 --> 14:45.343
Hey, you still
thinking about Danielle?

14:45.343 --> 14:46.928
What makes you say that?

14:46.928 --> 14:48.930
You spelled her name
in dinosaur erasers.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.475
Well, I was going to spell
her name in flower petals

14:52.475 --> 14:53.976
on your front lawn,

14:53.976 --> 14:55.770
but tulip season isn't
for three months.

14:55.770 --> 14:57.188
Curse you, Mother Nature!

14:58.940 --> 15:01.901
‐I'm sorry, Leo.
‐Thanks.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.569
I can't believe
she's only tutoring you

15:03.569 --> 15:05.321
for a few more days.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.323
My wooing plan is ruined.

15:07.323 --> 15:10.618
Once you pass that test,
I'm out of time.

15:10.618 --> 15:13.204
But what if I didn't
pass the test?

15:13.204 --> 15:16.290
‐What?
‐Yeah, I'll fail on purpose.

15:16.290 --> 15:18.417
That way, my mom
will have to keep Danielle

15:18.417 --> 15:21.963
and you'll have more time
to be all weird and woo‐y.

15:23.297 --> 15:24.924
Seriously?

15:24.924 --> 15:27.135
I'm probably going
to blow this test anyway,

15:27.135 --> 15:28.845
so I might as well
do it for you.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.639
Max, that's the most
beautiful thing

15:31.639 --> 15:32.849
you've ever said.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.851
♪ ♪

15:38.813 --> 15:40.356
Hey, Dad.

15:40.356 --> 15:42.775
So, how was your date?

15:43.734 --> 15:45.153
Not so good.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.822
Why? What happened?

15:47.822 --> 15:49.615
Gemma's ex‐boyfriend
came to Portland

15:49.615 --> 15:50.950
and they're getting
back together.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.661
What? But that means‐‐

15:53.661 --> 15:55.163
Yup.

15:55.163 --> 15:56.873
She broke up with me.

16:03.629 --> 16:07.008
No! How could
Gemma dump Mr. R?

16:07.008 --> 16:09.260
I know, I'm so sad.

16:09.260 --> 16:12.763
He's so sad.
I'm so sad to see him so sad.

16:12.763 --> 16:14.265
There's a lot of
sad going on.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.059
So what happened?

16:17.059 --> 16:19.520
She got back together
with her ex‐boyfriend.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.647
How could she choose
another guy over my dad?

16:21.647 --> 16:23.107
Have you met my dad?

16:23.107 --> 16:25.568
Many times. He's lovely.

16:26.861 --> 16:29.322
Too bad they only had
four and a half dates.

16:29.322 --> 16:33.075
Yeah, she never got the full
Max Reynolds experience.

16:35.203 --> 16:38.497
I know. I'll use
my lesson tomorrow
to show her

16:38.497 --> 16:40.750
all the sides of him
that she didn't get to see.

16:40.750 --> 16:43.294
Great!
You'll sell her on your dad

16:43.294 --> 16:46.130
and she'll realize he's
the perfect man for her.

16:46.130 --> 16:48.341
Like Baxter is for me.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.676
Oh, girl, you gotta let that go.

16:50.676 --> 16:51.928
Why?

16:51.928 --> 16:53.638
I invented
a really great guy,

16:53.638 --> 16:56.307
and I can't just
abandon my first love,

16:56.307 --> 16:57.600
even if he doesn't exist.

16:58.809 --> 17:00.519
Yeah, okay,
now I hear it.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.441
Hey, how'd the test go?

17:05.441 --> 17:07.193
Bad news.

17:08.611 --> 17:10.029
I passed.

17:11.989 --> 17:13.824
Somehow, Danielle
taught me stuff,

17:13.824 --> 17:16.452
even though I tried
my hardest not to learn.

17:16.452 --> 17:19.038
(sighs) I'm so ashamed.

17:20.039 --> 17:23.125
No, don't beat yourself up.
You did your worst.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.338
Anyway, Danielle is
on her way over to celebrate.

17:27.338 --> 17:29.632
This is your chance
to tell her how you feel.

17:29.632 --> 17:32.677
(sighs) I'm not at all ready,
but I guess I have no choice.

17:32.677 --> 17:35.388
I knew I should have
overnighted that top hat.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.598
(doorbell rings)

17:40.810 --> 17:42.645
Hey, Max, congrats, bud.

17:42.645 --> 17:43.604
Thanks.

17:44.605 --> 17:47.066
‐Hi, Leo.
‐Hello.

17:50.194 --> 17:52.280
My mom bought
a cake to celebrate

17:52.280 --> 17:56.951
and I'm going to get some
because I like cake.

17:59.662 --> 18:01.706
Uh, Danielle, can I
talk to you for a sec?

18:01.706 --> 18:03.207
Sure. What's up?

18:04.292 --> 18:09.088
Well, first of all,
imagine me with a top hat.

18:10.464 --> 18:13.551
Okay. Why?

18:13.551 --> 18:15.428
Because I like you.

18:15.428 --> 18:18.306
I know what you're thinking,
you're in ninth grade,

18:18.306 --> 18:21.058
I'm in eighth, you get out
of school at 3:15

18:21.058 --> 18:24.145
and I get out at 2:45.
We're from two
different worlds.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.565
But I think
we can make it work.

18:28.482 --> 18:32.695
Leo, I'm beyond flattered
and I think you're awesome,

18:32.695 --> 18:34.614
but I barely know you.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.617
How about next year
when you're in high school,

18:37.617 --> 18:38.743
we try hanging out?

18:38.743 --> 18:40.119
Like as friends.

18:42.038 --> 18:44.582
All right, I guess
I can live with that.

18:44.582 --> 18:46.917
Great. I'm going
to go grab some cake.

18:52.381 --> 18:54.759
So, how'd it go?

18:54.759 --> 18:56.052
Well, she was
nice about it,

18:56.052 --> 18:59.221
but it's not happening.
Man, this hurts.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.891
I hope romance gets easier
when we grow up.

19:02.850 --> 19:04.852
Who knows?

19:04.852 --> 19:08.814
But in the meantime,
there may be another
tutor in your future.

19:09.899 --> 19:11.400
I'm pretty sure
I'm flunking history.

19:13.319 --> 19:14.320
(doorbell rings)

19:19.659 --> 19:21.202
Hey, Gemma.

19:21.202 --> 19:23.120
Hey, Syd. You ready
for your lesson?

19:23.120 --> 19:24.914
Sure am.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.333
I'm so glad you called.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.460
I was worried
that you might not
want to continue

19:29.460 --> 19:31.045
after what happened
with me and your dad.

19:31.045 --> 19:34.382
Oh, that? It's all good.

19:34.382 --> 19:36.509
Anyway, I heard a song
with a bass riff

19:36.509 --> 19:38.135
that I thought
you could teach me.

19:38.135 --> 19:39.261
Cool. Let's hear it.

19:42.723 --> 19:45.935
Max:
<i>♪ I know you got a cold</i>
<i>and it's getting old ♪</i>

19:45.935 --> 19:49.605
♪ <i>So I wrote you this tune</i>
<i>to help you feel better</i>
<i>soon, hey</i> ♪

19:51.315 --> 19:54.443
Sorry, didn't mean
to play that.

19:54.443 --> 19:57.446
That was a voicemail
my dad left me
when I was sick.

19:57.446 --> 19:59.699
That's okay.
It was very sweet.

19:59.699 --> 20:04.161
Yeah. Sweet is just
one of his many
wonderful qualities.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.539
But let me get my bass.

20:09.667 --> 20:12.211
Whoops, wouldn't want
to break that.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.964
It's my dad's
Heart of Portland award.

20:14.964 --> 20:16.674
The mayor gave it to him

20:16.674 --> 20:20.177
for donating used bikes
to underprivileged kids.

20:20.177 --> 20:21.345
They're not going
to, like, come out

20:21.345 --> 20:22.930
and read a poem
about him, are they?

20:24.974 --> 20:26.934
He's sweet and generous.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.728
‐Hm.
‐(doorbell rings)

20:28.728 --> 20:31.063
I wonder who that could be.

20:37.445 --> 20:39.905
Hey, Syd.
Just returning
this cut‐out

20:39.905 --> 20:42.366
from your dad's
birthday party.
You know,

20:42.366 --> 20:45.327
the one everyone
signed saying how much
they loved him.

20:46.954 --> 20:49.290
Thanks.
That's so unexpected.

20:50.958 --> 20:53.252
Yeah, it took me
forever to sign it

20:53.252 --> 20:55.671
because I couldn't
decide what I loved
most about him.

20:55.671 --> 20:59.091
I mean, how many
great qualities
can one man have?

20:59.091 --> 21:00.468
Apparently quite a few.

21:07.391 --> 21:08.893
What's happening here?

21:09.810 --> 21:11.395
Um‐‐

21:11.395 --> 21:13.230
You forgot yourself
at my house,

21:13.230 --> 21:15.733
but now you're
both home, so bye!

21:18.819 --> 21:21.614
I think your daughter
was trying to get us
back together.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.032
Oh, boy.

21:24.033 --> 21:25.534
Gemma, can you
leave us alone to talk?

21:25.534 --> 21:28.829
Syd'll see you at
her next actual lesson.

21:28.829 --> 21:30.247
Sounds good.

21:30.247 --> 21:32.374
‐Bye, Max.
‐Bye.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.586
See ya, rock star.

21:40.257 --> 21:42.426
Syd, what's going on?

21:42.426 --> 21:47.223
I'm sorry, I just wanted Gemma
to get a full picture of you.

21:47.223 --> 21:49.141
Because if she
knew you like I do,

21:49.141 --> 21:51.143
she'd never
choose anyone else.

21:51.143 --> 21:54.104
Thanks for having my back, Syd,
but you didn't need to do that.

21:55.773 --> 21:58.442
I just hate seeing you
so hurt and upset.

21:59.652 --> 22:02.196
‐I know how much
you liked her.
‐I did.

22:02.196 --> 22:03.864
And I'm definitely
disappointed,

22:03.864 --> 22:06.408
but I'm going to be okay.

22:06.408 --> 22:10.162
You sure, Dad? You're not
totally heartbroken?

22:10.162 --> 22:14.375
Yes, I'm sure. In fact,
I'm grateful to Gemma.

22:14.375 --> 22:15.876
She helped me realize
that I can still feel

22:15.876 --> 22:17.795
the same kind of sparks
I felt for your mom.

22:19.380 --> 22:21.173
Now, I have hope
there's someone
out there for me.

22:22.383 --> 22:25.970
Wow, that is
extremely mature.

22:25.970 --> 22:28.347
Well, there is
a slight difference

22:28.347 --> 22:31.642
between being an adult
and being a middle schooler.

22:31.642 --> 22:33.102
Hey, take a picture of us.

22:38.315 --> 22:40.818
And we're back
to middle school.

22:40.818 --> 22:42.111
(camera clicks)

22:44.947 --> 22:47.575
Hey, Syd, where are
you going with my
Heart of Portland award?

22:47.575 --> 22:49.118
I'm putting it
back in your room.

22:49.118 --> 22:52.496
You know what?
Maybe it does
look better here.

22:52.496 --> 22:54.331
I mean,
the Heart of Portland
might as well be

22:54.331 --> 22:57.167
in the heart
of the living room.

22:57.167 --> 22:59.378
You want it sitting out
so you can impress
future dates

22:59.378 --> 23:01.505
and pretend to be
embarrassed, don't you?

23:01.505 --> 23:02.840
Oh, thank you
for believing

23:02.840 --> 23:04.425
that there are
dates in my future.

23:04.425 --> 23:05.509
(door opens)

23:06.594 --> 23:09.847
Hey, Grandma, did you ever
find your mystery man?

23:09.847 --> 23:12.099
Yeah, and it turns out
he's been looking everywhere

23:12.099 --> 23:13.309
for me, too.

23:13.309 --> 23:14.310
Yay!

23:14.310 --> 23:16.520
Yeah, until I found out why.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.731
He owns an
extermination company

23:18.731 --> 23:21.817
and wants me to dance
out front as the store's
new mascot.

23:21.817 --> 23:23.694
‐Bummer.
‐Most embarrassing part

23:23.694 --> 23:25.404
is I asked
how much it paid.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.156
I'm so sorry
it didn't work out, Mom.

23:27.156 --> 23:28.741
What do you mean?
I start next week.

23:32.328 --> 23:34.955
