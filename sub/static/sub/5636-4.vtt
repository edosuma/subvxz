WEBVTT

00:04.505 --> 00:06.246
Steve,
I just got a weird e-mail.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.922
Did you buy us
airline tickets?

00:08.007 --> 00:09.874
Aw, shoot. It was supposed
to be a surprise.

00:09.968 --> 00:11.333
I wanted
to thank you

00:11.428 --> 00:12.759
for letting me live here
all this time,

00:12.846 --> 00:14.587
so I'm treating the family
to a vacation!

00:14.681 --> 00:15.887
Steve,
you're so sweet.

00:15.974 --> 00:17.840
- Thanks, Uncle Steve!
- Best uncle ever.

00:17.935 --> 00:19.300
Look out, world.

00:19.394 --> 00:20.805
The Smith family
is going to Paris!

00:20.896 --> 00:22.478
Yeah! Awesome!

00:22.564 --> 00:24.521
Rick, I don't like glowing
rocks in the kitchen trash!

00:24.608 --> 00:26.224
Well,
I don't like

00:26.318 --> 00:28.730
your unemployed genes
in my grandchildren, Jerry,

00:28.820 --> 00:30.902
but life is made
of little concessions.

00:30.989 --> 00:32.354
I --
you know what?

00:32.448 --> 00:33.860
You're gonna land
on your feet, Jer.

00:33.951 --> 00:35.783
Some company out there's
gonna thank their lucky stars

00:35.869 --> 00:37.655
they hired
my little brother.

00:37.746 --> 00:38.656
Who the fuck are you?

00:38.747 --> 00:40.237
My goofy brother, Steve.

00:40.332 --> 00:42.448
He's been
living here almost a year now.

00:42.543 --> 00:43.704
Are you
losing your mind?

00:43.794 --> 00:45.376
Hey,
someone's been spending

00:45.462 --> 00:47.248
too much time
around glowing rocks.

00:47.339 --> 00:48.329
Am I right?

00:49.758 --> 00:50.668
- Oh, my god!
- Call an ambulance!

00:50.759 --> 00:51.669
Oh, god! Steve!

00:51.760 --> 00:52.795
What the hell, Rick?!
What the hell?!

00:52.886 --> 00:54.092
Will everybody just relax
for a second?

00:54.179 --> 00:56.637
There's no such thing
as an "Uncle Steve."

00:56.723 --> 00:58.885
That is an alien parasite.

01:00.269 --> 01:01.851
But I've known him
my whole life.

01:01.937 --> 01:03.268
No, you haven't,
Jerry.

01:03.355 --> 01:04.720
These telepathic
little bastards,

01:04.815 --> 01:06.431
they embed themselves
in memories,

01:06.525 --> 01:07.981
and th-then they use
those to multiply

01:08.068 --> 01:09.809
and spread out,
take over planets.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.109
It's --
it's disgusting.

01:11.196 --> 01:12.277
Steve wasn't real?

01:12.364 --> 01:13.570
He's a real
piece of shit.

01:13.657 --> 01:15.147
This is a big one.
Somebody probably

01:15.242 --> 01:16.778
tracked it in last week
on the bottom of their shoe

01:16.868 --> 01:18.324
on a piece of alien fruit.

01:18.412 --> 01:19.902
- Someone?
- Get off the high road, Summer.

01:19.997 --> 01:21.203
We all
got pink eye

01:21.290 --> 01:23.031
because you won't stop
texting on the toilet.

01:23.125 --> 01:25.036
But Uncle Steve taught me
how to ride a bike!

01:25.127 --> 01:27.118
No, "Steve" put that memory
in your brain

01:27.212 --> 01:29.328
so he could live in your house,
eat your food, and multiply.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.039
We could be infested
with these things.

01:31.133 --> 01:32.715
So we got to keep an eye out

01:32.801 --> 01:34.633
for any zany, wacky
characters that pop up.

01:34.720 --> 01:36.176
Ooh, whee!

01:36.263 --> 01:37.674
Whatever you want, Rick!
We're here to help!

01:37.764 --> 01:39.300
Thanks,
Mr. Poopybutthole.

01:39.391 --> 01:42.053
I always could
count on you.

01:42.144 --> 01:45.682
♪♪

02:13.967 --> 02:14.957
♪♪

02:16.386 --> 02:18.753
All right. There's six of us,
and that's it.

02:18.847 --> 02:21.635
Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth,
Mr. Poopybutthole, and Summer.

02:21.725 --> 02:24.217
Maybe you got the first one
in time, Rick!

02:24.311 --> 02:26.268
Can't afford to chance it.

02:31.485 --> 02:34.147
Dad, why does our house
have blast shields?

02:34.237 --> 02:35.523
Trust me, Beth,
you don't want to know

02:35.614 --> 02:36.820
how many answers
that question has.

02:36.907 --> 02:38.773
Ooh, gosh,
it feels claustrophobic!

02:38.867 --> 02:40.278
Reminds me
of that time

02:40.369 --> 02:42.451
we all got stuck
in the elevator together.

02:42.537 --> 02:46.405
Y-- remember that?
After "The Hulk" musical?

02:50.295 --> 02:52.502
Jerry, buttons don't work better
if you hit them harder,

02:52.589 --> 02:54.296
And foam fists
don't make you strong.

02:54.383 --> 02:56.340
I know.
Friends make you strong.

02:56.426 --> 02:58.508
I watched
the same musical you did.

02:58.595 --> 03:00.461
Why couldn't I bring
my portal gun?

03:01.973 --> 03:03.509
Why did all the drinks
have to be extra large?

03:03.600 --> 03:05.216
Oh, the Hulk.
I just got that.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.802
Just pee your pants. I did it
the minute we got stuck.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.682
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah,
shame me.

03:09.773 --> 03:12.390
At least when I'm disgusting,
it's on purpose.

03:12.484 --> 03:14.350
Oh, y'all,
we're gonna be fine.

03:14.444 --> 03:17.527
I've always been here for
you guys, and I always will be.

03:17.614 --> 03:20.857
Somebody call for repairs?

03:20.951 --> 03:22.362
Yay! Cousin Nicky!

03:22.452 --> 03:23.658
It's me, cousin Nicky.

03:23.745 --> 03:25.577
I'm walkin' here!
I mean, I'm not.

03:25.664 --> 03:27.530
I'm crouched
in the elevator shaft,

03:27.624 --> 03:30.241
but hey,
I'm walkin' here!

03:31.670 --> 03:33.252
It's true.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.545
We really do get into some
crazy situations as a family,

03:35.632 --> 03:37.748
mostly when
we're cooped up like this.

03:37.843 --> 03:39.834
Hey, maybe
Mr. Poopypants is right.

03:39.928 --> 03:41.384
L-Let's get
some fresh air.

03:41.471 --> 03:42.711
Come on, cousin Nicky.
You heard Rick.

03:42.806 --> 03:44.342
We have to
stay quarantined

03:44.433 --> 03:45.969
until we know that there's
no more of these things.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.470
I hear you, Morty.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.268
Back in Brooklyn,
we got a sayin' --

03:49.354 --> 03:51.265
"We're walkin' here!"

03:51.356 --> 03:52.562
Nicky, get --

03:52.649 --> 03:53.764
Oh!

03:53.859 --> 03:55.566
What the...?

03:55.652 --> 03:57.563
Cousin Nicky
was a parasite?!

03:57.654 --> 03:59.486
Six, Morty! There's supposed
to be six of us!

03:59.573 --> 04:01.735
If there's seven, then
that means somebody's not real.

04:01.825 --> 04:03.361
But how did you know
it was Nicky?

04:03.452 --> 04:04.942
I guessed. That's why I
aimed for his shoulder.

04:05.036 --> 04:06.868
So we can't trust
any of our memories now?

04:06.955 --> 04:09.071
Nicky was the reason we found
that old Nazi submarine.

04:09.166 --> 04:10.497
Did that
not even happen?

04:10.584 --> 04:12.621
Well,
of course it happened.

04:12.711 --> 04:16.295
Now that I possess
the mighty staff of Rah-gubaba,

04:16.380 --> 04:18.588
the world will tremble
before the Fourth Reich!

04:18.675 --> 04:19.880
This is
the last time

04:19.968 --> 04:22.130
I ask you for help
on my history final, Rick.

04:22.220 --> 04:25.554
Hey, we got a word for Nazis
back in Brooklyn, pal.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.301
I'm comfortable being
called a Nazi.

04:27.392 --> 04:30.555
You think there's some other
word that will hurt my feelings?

04:30.645 --> 04:32.932
Yeah. Think before
you talk shit.

04:33.023 --> 04:36.015
Rah-gubaba,
help me kill America!

04:36.109 --> 04:38.100
Mr. Beauregard!

04:38.195 --> 04:42.780
After due consideration,
I have elected not to retire.

04:42.866 --> 04:44.607
- Yeah!
- Oh, thank god!

04:44.701 --> 04:47.910
Now, I believe someone
has a final exam to attend.

04:47.996 --> 04:50.328
Set a course
for Morty's high school.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.782
Perhaps I'm biased, but if
that story never happened,

04:52.876 --> 04:55.618
then I wouldn't still be
the family butler.

04:55.712 --> 04:56.918
Dare to dream.

04:57.005 --> 04:57.995
Wait.

04:58.423 --> 05:00.334
And if Mr. Beauregard
wasn't our butler,

05:00.425 --> 05:03.793
it's safe to say the family'd be
in a <i>hell</i> of a lot of trouble.

05:03.887 --> 05:05.753
No! Don't flashback!

05:05.847 --> 05:07.212
You're just gonna make
more swelling.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.468
- Don't worry, Jerry.
- Just relax.

05:08.558 --> 05:09.639
We called
the fire department.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.637
You know they won't
come here anymore.

05:15.190 --> 05:16.806
Marmalade is served.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.516
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Yeah!

05:18.610 --> 05:19.941
Oh, whee!

05:20.028 --> 05:22.816
I guess I take back what I said
about British cuisine.

05:24.074 --> 05:25.109
Take that, Summer!

05:25.200 --> 05:26.782
We're trying
to sleep.

05:26.868 --> 05:28.654
I don't want
to go to the dance alone.

05:28.745 --> 05:32.579
Then perhaps you shouldn't.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.577
Aww.
Mr. Beauregard.

05:34.668 --> 05:37.751
- Shall we, master Morty?
- We shall.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.795
Oh, wait,
don't leave without letting

05:39.881 --> 05:41.667
Photography Raptor
take a picture.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.090
Everybody
stop remembering!

05:47.180 --> 05:48.841
These parasites
are like bed bugs,

05:48.932 --> 05:50.969
and every flashback
is another mattress. Look!

05:51.059 --> 05:53.596
There's only supposed to be
six people in this house.

05:53.687 --> 05:54.848
But there's always
been 10.

05:54.938 --> 05:55.928
No!

05:56.523 --> 05:57.684
Uh, the fact
that I wrote this number down

05:57.774 --> 05:58.855
means that
there's four parasites.

05:58.942 --> 06:00.103
You sure about that,
Rick?

06:00.193 --> 06:01.854
Begging your pardon,
master Rick,

06:01.945 --> 06:03.936
but I seem to recall
a great deal of confusion

06:04.030 --> 06:05.111
surrounding
that number.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.563
All right,
there's six of us.

06:06.658 --> 06:07.819
And that's it.

06:07.909 --> 06:10.526
Me, Morty, Jerry,
Beth, Mr. Poopybutthole,

06:10.620 --> 06:12.827
Frankenstein, Sleepy Gary,
Photography Raptor,

06:12.914 --> 06:14.200
Mr. Beauregard, and Summer.

06:14.291 --> 06:16.077
Uh, Dad,
that's like 10 people.

06:16.167 --> 06:18.033
6, 10,
what's the difference?

06:18.128 --> 06:20.620
I just love the number 6
for no reason!

06:20.714 --> 06:21.875
Where's my pencil at?

06:21.965 --> 06:23.251
Here, Rick!
Use me!

06:23.341 --> 06:25.048
Oh, thanks,
Pencilvester!

06:25.135 --> 06:27.172
Yeah, I-I g--
I guess that is what happened,

06:27.262 --> 06:29.128
but I-I don't get
why I would do that.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.883
Everybody makes
mistakes, Rick.

06:30.974 --> 06:32.885
Why do you think
I have one of these?

06:35.020 --> 06:36.306
That's it.
Photos.

06:36.396 --> 06:37.932
Hard evidence.

06:38.023 --> 06:40.731
You're not in any of my photos,
Mr. Poopybutthole.

06:40.817 --> 06:42.558
Well, what do you know
about this?

06:42.652 --> 06:45.019
You're not in
any of mine.

06:45.113 --> 06:49.152
All I have are pictures of me
and my friends from school.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.779
What? What teenage girl
has pictures of her family?

06:51.870 --> 06:53.702
It's not like we're
Mormon or dying.

06:53.788 --> 06:56.826
I will admit it's suspicious
that Summer's only friend

06:56.917 --> 06:59.705
is a magic ballerina lamb
that we've never seen.

06:59.794 --> 07:00.784
Summer!

07:01.254 --> 07:02.244

07:03.006 --> 07:05.043

- Summer, we're trying to sleep.

07:34.913 --> 07:36.403
It was Tinkles!

07:36.498 --> 07:37.488
Tinkles?

07:37.916 --> 07:39.202
That is su-- --
suspicious.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.203
We're always hearing about
this Tinkles character,

07:41.294 --> 07:42.910
- But we never get to --
- Hi, everybody.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.086
I'm Tinkles,
and these are my friends.

07:46.341 --> 07:47.923
See, everyone?
Tinkles is real.

07:48.009 --> 07:49.249
That means so am I.

07:49.344 --> 07:51.460
- Sorry, Summer.
- Man, I'm sorry, Summer.

07:51.554 --> 07:54.171
I was on the wrong side
of the pitchfork on this one.

07:54.265 --> 07:56.973
Okay, look, we shouldn't need
evidence or logic

07:57.060 --> 07:59.051
to know who's family
and who isn't.

07:59.145 --> 08:00.852
I know
who the Smiths are.

08:00.939 --> 08:02.930
I've known Beth
since High School.

08:03.024 --> 08:04.810
And her husband,
sleepy Gary,

08:04.901 --> 08:07.017
is hands down
my absolute best friend.

08:07.112 --> 08:08.227
Thanks, Jerry.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.107
Beyond that,
no offense to any of you,

08:10.198 --> 08:11.529
but all bets
are off.

08:11.616 --> 08:14.074
Look, I'm not used to being
this unsure for this long.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.525
I'm just gonna aim for shoulders
starting with the weird girl.

08:15.620 --> 08:16.610
Aah!

08:17.205 --> 08:18.991
- Grandpa Rick!
- Hold still, "Summer."

08:19.082 --> 08:21.244
Rick,
that is my daughter.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.871
Oh, yeah? Well, what if you just
think that, sleepy Gary?

08:23.962 --> 08:26.169
I've known you for 15 years.
Don't make me hurt you.

08:26.256 --> 08:28.497
Rick, these are
our family and friends,

08:28.591 --> 08:30.332
the people
we barbecue with.

08:30.427 --> 08:32.337
Have you forgotten
the barbecue?

08:32.429 --> 08:33.840
Wait,
why would you want me to --

08:33.929 --> 08:35.135
You're one of them,
aren't you?

08:35.222 --> 08:38.135
Rick. You love
those barbecues, Rick.

08:38.226 --> 08:39.466
You <i>love</i> them.
Hai!

08:39.561 --> 08:40.926
Remember it,
Rick?

08:41.020 --> 08:43.261
Shut up, Hamurai!
Shut up, Amish Cyborg!

08:43.356 --> 08:45.063
What is this?
'90s Conan?

08:45.150 --> 08:47.016
Remember the barbecue.

08:47.110 --> 08:50.102
Remember the barbecue.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.278
You know what, Pencilvester?

08:52.365 --> 08:54.356
It took me my whole life
to realize it,

08:54.451 --> 08:56.033
but I love barbecuing.

08:56.119 --> 08:57.860
- You're good at it, Rick.
- Watch me, baby.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.911
I'm like Tom Cruise from,
um, "Cuisine"

08:59.998 --> 09:02.581
or w-whatever that movie's
called where he makes drinks.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.032
Yeah,
check me out.

09:04.127 --> 09:05.617
I'm like Tom Cruise
from "Cuisine."

09:05.712 --> 09:07.043
Yeah.

09:07.130 --> 09:08.541
Is that what it's called?
"Cuisine"?

09:08.631 --> 09:10.087
Wow!
Hey, everybody

09:10.175 --> 09:12.337
Let's give it up
for the grillmaster Rick!

09:12.427 --> 09:13.588
Rick!
Rick! Rick!

09:17.599 --> 09:18.589
Wait.

09:21.770 --> 09:22.760
Noooooo!

09:23.271 --> 09:24.352
Shoot. Now look.

09:24.439 --> 09:25.600
It's like
a "Where's Waldo?" page.

09:25.690 --> 09:26.976
Can you find me?

09:27.067 --> 09:28.307
Check out
all these zany characters.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.267
We'll be right back
after these messages.

09:32.322 --> 09:34.154
I think
you should put down the gun

09:34.240 --> 09:35.696
and we should get you
to a doctor.

09:35.784 --> 09:37.570
What do you say we take down
these blast shields?

09:37.660 --> 09:39.116
- Yeah.
- I can't do that, sleepy Gary.

09:39.204 --> 09:40.615
All right,
everybody listen to me.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.116
I don't know
if any of you guys are real,

09:42.207 --> 09:44.118
but this house has been infested
with fake loved ones

09:44.209 --> 09:45.745
that spread
through fake memories,

09:45.835 --> 09:47.576
and our planet will be destroyed
if they get out.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.712
But, Rick,
even you have to admit

09:50.799 --> 09:53.040
you do tend
to overreact to stuff.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.499
You guys,
we got to hurry.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.050
I just got back
from Walmart.

09:56.137 --> 09:58.754
They're selling Nintendo 3DS
systems for $149.99 on sale,

09:58.848 --> 10:01.135
plus every time you buy one,
you get a $50 gift card.

10:01.226 --> 10:03.513
Brings the total price down
to $110 after tax.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.685
Now, listen, we can flip
those sons of bitches

10:05.772 --> 10:07.058
for 230 bucks
a piece easy!

10:07.148 --> 10:09.059
They're all limited-edition
"Zelda" ones.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.732
Hurry! Hurry!
Come with me!

10:10.819 --> 10:12.810
We can be rich,
and we also all get to keep one

10:12.904 --> 10:14.611
and we can play
Nintendo games!

10:14.697 --> 10:16.779
Nintendo,
give me free stuff.

10:16.866 --> 10:19.073
Okay, yes, I definitely
remember doing that,

10:19.160 --> 10:20.946
but also,
I would never do that.

10:21.037 --> 10:22.573
Don't overreact, Rick.

10:22.664 --> 10:24.655
- Sleepy Gary, a word?
- Sure, Jerry.

10:24.749 --> 10:26.239
Rick, keep a
level head, okay?

10:26.334 --> 10:28.996
'Cause I'll tell you a secret
about Frankenstein --

10:29.087 --> 10:33.206
He's actually
Frankenstein's monster.

10:34.926 --> 10:37.839
Sleepy Gary,
m-my head is filled

10:37.929 --> 10:39.215
with memories
of our friendship.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.761
I'm convinced
that you're Beth's husband

10:40.849 --> 10:42.089
and I'm your friend,

10:42.183 --> 10:44.265
but if those memories
can't be trusted, then...

10:44.352 --> 10:45.717
Jerry,
just say it.

10:45.812 --> 10:48.975
Sleepy Gary,
how do we know I'm real?

10:49.065 --> 10:50.976
Jesus, Jerry.

10:51.067 --> 10:52.478
No, you're real.

10:52.569 --> 10:53.855
Hey,
look at me.

10:53.945 --> 10:55.527
Now, I don't know
which way is up out there,

10:55.613 --> 10:58.150
but I know us,
and you're real, Jerry.

10:58.241 --> 10:59.857
Remember our vacation?

11:02.495 --> 11:05.237
They're filming that new "Star
Wars" movie down the coast.

11:05.331 --> 11:06.412
Should we
check it out?

11:06.499 --> 11:08.490
Sure. Why not?

11:15.508 --> 11:19.046
Maybe we'll see
Chewbacca.

11:19.137 --> 11:21.253
I'd like that.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.182
What are we doing?

11:35.278 --> 11:37.736
I don't give a damn
what else happens out there.

11:37.822 --> 11:40.405
You and I
are going to survive this.

11:40.491 --> 11:41.481
Okay.

11:42.076 --> 11:43.441
Hey,
we agreed.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.197
Never in the house.

11:47.332 --> 11:48.493
That's a cool watch
there, Rick.

11:48.583 --> 11:49.618
Can I
check it out?

11:49.709 --> 11:51.245
Uh, no thank --

11:51.336 --> 11:52.246
Okay.

11:52.337 --> 11:53.293
Trying
to figure out

11:53.379 --> 11:54.414
how to lower
the blast shields, huh?

11:54.505 --> 11:56.371
Anybody here
think it's suspicious

11:56.466 --> 11:58.833
that a lot of people in here
can't wait to get out of here?

11:58.927 --> 12:02.340
Ah, you're paranoid, Rick.
You've been paranoid since 'Nam.

12:02.430 --> 12:03.920
So,
what are you gonna do

12:04.015 --> 12:05.346
when you rotate back
to the world, Frankenstein?

12:05.433 --> 12:08.095
Shi-i-i-i-t.
I'mma bust a --

12:08.186 --> 12:11.144
No!
Get out of my head, parasite!

12:11.231 --> 12:12.062
- No!
- Drop it.

12:12.148 --> 12:13.229
Give me the gun,
Frankenstein!

12:16.152 --> 12:17.313
Give it back!

12:17.403 --> 12:19.269
Yeah!

12:19.364 --> 12:20.354
Frankenstein!

12:21.157 --> 12:22.943
Is anyone here even real?

12:23.034 --> 12:24.570
Am I the only real person
on Earth?!

12:24.661 --> 12:25.696
Maybe.

12:25.787 --> 12:28.529
Or maybe, just maybe,
we're all real.

12:28.623 --> 12:29.784
You know me.
I'm Reverse Giraffe.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.535
I have a short neck
and legs.

12:31.626 --> 12:33.082
- I went to college with Hamurai.
- Hai!

12:33.169 --> 12:35.251
I saved Ghost In A Jar's
life in Vietnam.

12:35.338 --> 12:37.249
- Boo rah!
- And, Beth, how many times

12:37.340 --> 12:39.331
have I been a shoulder
for you to cry on?

12:39.425 --> 12:41.211
Too many.

12:41.302 --> 12:43.134
Okay,
so maybe we're just all fake.

12:43.221 --> 12:44.711
That don't make
no sense!

12:44.806 --> 12:47.514
Or maybe there's only one
deceiver here --

12:47.600 --> 12:48.715
The person
that keeps telling us

12:48.810 --> 12:51.427
the path to salvation
is being held prisoner

12:51.521 --> 12:52.761
and mistrusting
each other.

12:52.855 --> 12:53.970
Hey,
don't blame me!

12:54.065 --> 12:55.351
I tried to shoot Summer
10 minutes ago!

12:55.441 --> 12:57.773
I know we all have
beloved memories of Rick,

12:57.860 --> 12:59.726
but are we really
supposed to believe

12:59.821 --> 13:02.483
that a mad scientist inventor
with a flying car

13:02.573 --> 13:06.032
just showed up on our doorstep
after being gone for years?

13:06.119 --> 13:07.530
Yeah, you know,
he does have

13:07.620 --> 13:10.032
a lot of really weird,
made-up sounding catchphrases.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.534
Wubba Iubba dub dub!

13:11.624 --> 13:13.831
Ricky ticky tavi, beyotch!

13:13.918 --> 13:16.956
And that's the wa-a-a-a-y
the news goes.

13:17.046 --> 13:18.161
Hit the sack,
Jack.

13:18.256 --> 13:19.997
Uh-oh!
Somersault jump.

13:20.091 --> 13:21.081
AIDS!

13:21.509 --> 13:25.127
And that's why I always say
shum shum shlippedy dop!

13:25.221 --> 13:28.213
Grasses tastes bad-ah.

13:28.933 --> 13:30.344
No jumpin'
in the sewer.

13:30.435 --> 13:31.550
Burger time!

13:31.644 --> 13:33.430
Rubber baby
baby bunkers!

13:33.521 --> 13:35.432
Lick, lick,
lick my balls!

13:35.523 --> 13:36.854
Yeah!

13:36.941 --> 13:38.147
Say that all the time.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.109
That's a fake-ass catchphrase
right there.

13:41.195 --> 13:43.357
Yeah, don't forget
his incredibly vague back story.

13:43.448 --> 13:44.984
Beth,
I'm your father!

13:45.074 --> 13:46.235
Oh, are you, Dad?
Are you?

13:46.326 --> 13:48.067
Rick, if you want
to prove you're real,

13:48.161 --> 13:50.277
just do what any of the rest
of us would do and --

13:50.371 --> 13:51.577
and -- and open
the blast shields

13:51.664 --> 13:53.371
and let us
the hell out of here!

13:53.458 --> 13:56.450
Why don't you make me,
implausibly naive pubescent boy

13:56.544 --> 13:59.036
with an old Jewish
comedy writer's name?

13:59.130 --> 14:00.370
Ooh!
Ooh! Ooh!

14:00.465 --> 14:02.581
In your face!

14:02.675 --> 14:04.291
Give me the gun.

14:04.385 --> 14:07.423
I'm not doing this
in front of Pencilvester.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.220
Bring him
to the garage.

14:10.683 --> 14:13.516
You listen to me, you
son of a bitch parasite scum.

14:13.603 --> 14:16.140
We could either do this
the easy way or the hard way.

14:16.230 --> 14:17.391
You know, y-y-y--
do you want to live?

14:17.482 --> 14:18.938
Then open
the blast shield doors.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.641
Shut up, Morty,
you brainwashed, little turd

14:20.735 --> 14:23.193
that might not even be real
because I'm brainwashed, too.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.986
You know, Rick,
this isn't easy for us.

14:25.073 --> 14:26.655
You know, w-we all remember
you as a friend.

14:26.741 --> 14:28.482
Oh, oh, oh,
really?

14:28.576 --> 14:30.362
Well, I remember you as a whiny,
little piece of shit, Morty!

14:30.453 --> 14:31.614
- Oh -- oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

14:31.704 --> 14:33.411
I've got
about a thousand memories

14:33.498 --> 14:35.660
of your dumb, little ass and
about six of them are pleasant.

14:35.750 --> 14:37.491
The rest
is annoying garbage.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.496
So why don't you do us both
a favor and pull the trigger?

14:39.587 --> 14:40.702
Do it!
Do it, motherfucker!

14:40.797 --> 14:43.710
Pull
the fucking trigger!

14:44.759 --> 14:46.375
Oh, wow.

14:46.469 --> 14:48.301
Baby Wizard
was a parasite?

14:48.388 --> 14:50.174
He set me up
with my wife.

14:50.264 --> 14:52.096
What the hell?

14:52.183 --> 14:53.639
I figured it out, Rick!

14:53.726 --> 14:55.182
The parasites can only create
pleasant memories.

14:55.269 --> 14:56.475
I know
you're real

14:56.562 --> 14:59.600
because I have a ton
of bad memories with you!

14:59.690 --> 15:04.776
♪ <i>These memories that we have</i> ♪

15:06.614 --> 15:12.405
♪ <i>These memories
that we cherish</i> ♪

15:12.495 --> 15:20.495
♪ <i>I wish that we can go
back to that time</i> ♪

15:22.213 --> 15:24.329
♪ <i>Ooh, ooh, ooh</i> ♪

15:24.424 --> 15:26.586
Holy crap, Morty,
you're right.

15:26.676 --> 15:28.667
Is -- is -- isn't that what you were trying
to make me understand by yelling at me?

15:28.761 --> 15:31.344
Well, yeah,
duh-doy.

15:31.431 --> 15:34.173
T-Took you
long enough.

15:35.643 --> 15:37.259
Now let's go, Morty.

15:37.353 --> 15:39.435
We got a lot of friends
and family to exterminate.

15:42.859 --> 15:45.476
Everybody remain calm! This is
gonna take some explaining.

15:45.570 --> 15:48.232
We need to kill everyone that
we can only remember fondly.

15:48.322 --> 15:50.404
Who's got a bad memory
about Mrs. Refrigerator?

15:50.491 --> 15:53.233
I-I-I-I -- everyone has
bad memories of me.

15:53.327 --> 15:55.159
You remember
that one time?

15:59.459 --> 16:02.247
Ooh, man,
we couldn't stop screaming.

16:02.336 --> 16:05.670
Uh, roller coasters aren't bad,
Mrs. Refrigerator.

16:05.756 --> 16:07.372
They're thrilling.

16:07.467 --> 16:10.801
And you've been a perfect
companion to me my entire life.

16:10.887 --> 16:12.252
The jig is up!

16:12.346 --> 16:13.836
Get me out of here.

16:13.931 --> 16:15.547
Get me out of here!

16:15.641 --> 16:17.257
Aah!

16:17.351 --> 16:18.807
Oh shit!

16:18.895 --> 16:20.681
Everybody back!
If you're not a parasite,

16:20.771 --> 16:22.728
you have nothing to fear.
So what about Summer?

16:22.815 --> 16:25.603
Why am I
always your go-to?

16:28.404 --> 16:30.771
- Never go in my room again.
- I didn't!

16:30.865 --> 16:31.775
She's real.

16:31.866 --> 16:33.527
She's my bitch
of a sister.

16:34.452 --> 16:35.533
Nice.

16:36.954 --> 16:37.944
♪♪

16:38.998 --> 16:40.614
Mom,
are you driving me to --

16:40.708 --> 16:42.415
Hmm?
Yeah, yeah, yes. What time?

16:42.502 --> 16:43.788
Oh, my god.
Are you drunk?

16:43.878 --> 16:45.368
What are you?

16:45.463 --> 16:46.749
- My wife coach?
- Your what?

16:46.839 --> 16:48.329
- Oh! God!
- Oh. Oh, my gosh.

16:48.424 --> 16:49.334
- Oh! God! Mom!
- Sweetheart, are you okay?

16:49.425 --> 16:50.586
I didn't mean to --

16:50.676 --> 16:52.838
I'm gonna have a bruise!
It's picture day!

16:52.929 --> 16:55.842
It's not -- don't overreact.
I can clean it up.

16:55.932 --> 16:57.843
I want the police to take me!

16:57.934 --> 16:59.766
Morty,
give a gun to the lady

16:59.852 --> 17:01.934
that got pregnant with me
too early

17:02.021 --> 17:04.308
and constantly makes it
our problem.

17:04.397 --> 17:06.059
Thank you,
sweetie.

17:06.150 --> 17:07.060
Beth, Beth, please!

17:07.151 --> 17:08.185
I thought it was too
good to be true

17:08.277 --> 17:10.518
that we'd have
compatible kidneys.

17:25.002 --> 17:26.458
Come on, man.

17:26.546 --> 17:27.957
Haven't we ever had
an uncomfortable silence

17:28.047 --> 17:29.754
or an awkward fart
on a road trip?

17:29.840 --> 17:31.751
Come on, Pencilvester.
Give me anything.

17:31.842 --> 17:33.082
Rick,
I'm Pencilvester.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.088
Listen to that name.
You can't kill me.

17:35.179 --> 17:37.170
You're right.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.548
Kill Pencilvester.

17:50.194 --> 17:51.901
Summer,
I've always loved you!

17:51.988 --> 17:54.025
Yep.

18:09.547 --> 18:10.537
Oh, my God!

18:10.631 --> 18:12.247
I-I-I thought you went
to a concert!

18:12.341 --> 18:15.459
We forgot the tickets!
Why in the kitchen?!

18:15.553 --> 18:17.339
I do it everywhere!
Stop shaming me!

18:17.430 --> 18:19.137
You're not
the victim here!

18:19.223 --> 18:21.089
I hate you, and I was thinking
about your friend Grace!

18:21.183 --> 18:22.173
Aaaaaah!

18:27.898 --> 18:29.764
Ah. Master Rick.

18:29.859 --> 18:31.770
Remember when you weren't
going to shoot me?

18:33.237 --> 18:35.569
I guess <i>I</i> did the Butler!
Ha ha!

18:35.656 --> 18:37.488
Does --
d-does that scan?

18:37.575 --> 18:38.815
Oh,
I-I get it.

18:38.909 --> 18:40.900
It's a play
on "The Butler Did It."

18:40.995 --> 18:42.360
Thanks,
Ghost In A Jar.

18:42.455 --> 18:45.538
You always were good at pointing
out potentially obscure comedy.

18:50.421 --> 18:52.378
You got to hide me,
sleepy Gary.

18:52.465 --> 18:53.796
Don't worry.
I have a plan.

18:53.883 --> 18:55.544
If we can get to my boat,
there's a --

18:57.803 --> 18:58.918
No. No!

18:59.013 --> 19:02.881
Just send me to Gary.
I want to be with Gary.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.091
Oh, God.

19:05.186 --> 19:06.972
Whoa.
What the hell?

19:07.063 --> 19:08.428
Look out
for that homeless guy!

19:08.522 --> 19:10.729
Open the door!
Open the door! Open the door!

19:10.816 --> 19:13.057
There isn't time!
Just run!

19:13.152 --> 19:14.734
Get out here and help me!

19:14.820 --> 19:17.482
They say you shouldn't do that!
Just run!

19:17.573 --> 19:20.361
Ugh. Sorry, Jerry.
You're real.

19:20.451 --> 19:22.567
I'm a parasite!

19:22.662 --> 19:24.744
Yeah,
but you're real.

19:24.830 --> 19:28.789
Uh, uh, I need time
to forget about sleepy Gary.

19:28.876 --> 19:30.287
Me, too.

19:33.464 --> 19:35.375
From now on, let's all be careful

19:35.466 --> 19:37.833
to wash our hands when
we get back from outer space.

19:37.927 --> 19:39.463
That goes
for everyone.

19:39.553 --> 19:40.759
This is depressing.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.803
We killed every good
person in the house.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.801
We're what's left?
What a family.

19:44.892 --> 19:46.474
At least we're real,
Jerry.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.221
We're real.
Ricky ticky tavi!

19:48.312 --> 19:50.804
Ooh, whee!
Amen to that.

19:50.898 --> 19:53.515
Now, this little Poopypants
is hungry.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.520
Will somebody
pass me a pork chop?

19:58.656 --> 19:59.771
Huh.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.731
I-Is -- is something wrong,
Beth?

20:01.826 --> 20:02.941
Ow!

20:03.035 --> 20:04.241
Oh, my God!

20:04.328 --> 20:05.443
No, Beth! Oh fuck!

20:05.538 --> 20:07.324
Wait, but I --

20:07.415 --> 20:08.576
- Oh, Beth! Why?!
- I need an ambulance!

20:08.666 --> 20:10.248
There's been a shooting.
My wife shot...

20:10.334 --> 20:13.076
Uh, my -- my wife shot
a long-time family friend.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.160
Why?

20:14.505 --> 20:15.870
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, Mr. Poopybutthole.

20:15.965 --> 20:17.547
- I-I thought --
- Keep breathing!

20:17.633 --> 20:19.294
- Oh, God. What's happening?
- Look at me!

20:19.385 --> 20:20.841
Look at me!
Don't -- don't fall asleep!

20:20.928 --> 20:22.885
Is -- is this what
bleeding to death is?

20:22.972 --> 20:24.713
Oh, whee.
Is this how I die?

20:24.807 --> 20:25.888
Oh, geez!
Oh, my god!

20:25.975 --> 20:27.557
Why would you
do this? Beth.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.429
It's not
supposed to hurt.

20:29.520 --> 20:30.305
I-I thought...

20:30.396 --> 20:32.387
Ooh, whee.

20:32.815 --> 20:36.649
♪♪

21:09.268 --> 21:12.056
Oh, he -- he's looking
a lot better.

21:12.146 --> 21:13.932
Listen, Beth, don't torture yourself.

21:14.023 --> 21:15.889
I made a similar mistake
years ago,

21:15.983 --> 21:18.350
but, you know,
on a planetary scale.

21:18.444 --> 21:19.900
Is, um,
is he mad at me?

21:19.987 --> 21:21.773
He's not
pressing charges.

21:21.864 --> 21:24.356
I mean, that's got to be
the "You shot me" equivalent

21:24.450 --> 21:26.657
of not being mad.

21:26.744 --> 21:28.451
Can he
have visitors?

21:28.537 --> 21:30.778
He'd like
to be alone.

21:30.873 --> 21:33.831
He told me
to tell you he's sorry

21:33.918 --> 21:35.875
you didn't have bad
memories of him?

21:37.546 --> 21:40.755
If you love him,
you should leave.

21:44.720 --> 21:47.553
And that's the wa-a-a-a-y
the news goes.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.347
Did you get any of that?

21:50.434 --> 21:52.550
It's-a good show-a.
