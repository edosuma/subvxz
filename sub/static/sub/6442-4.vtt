00:32.119 --> 00:33.485
Hi, Clark.

00:35.190 --> 00:38.523
Lana. I didn't think anybody else
was out here.

00:39.394 --> 00:42.124
Well, it looks like we had
the same idea for cooling off.

00:43.398 --> 00:44.729
Yeah, it's a scorcher.

00:50.705 --> 00:52.764
You know, I'll come back.

00:52.941 --> 00:55.136
Oh, no, why? It's a big lake.

00:55.310 --> 00:57.039
There's enough room for both of us.

00:59.414 --> 01:01.211
I'm game if you are.

01:05.720 --> 01:07.051
No peeking.

01:40.422 --> 01:41.980
Your turn, Clark.

01:42.157 --> 01:43.920
I promise I won't peek.

02:05.814 --> 02:07.076
Clark?

02:15.056 --> 02:16.318
Clark!

02:21.463 --> 02:22.930
Boo.

02:23.765 --> 02:25.562
Don't do that.

02:31.272 --> 02:34.571
You're...not funny.

02:42.584 --> 02:45.678
I always said there should be
nothing between us.

02:46.388 --> 02:47.912
Now there's not.

02:51.693 --> 02:53.160
Help!

02:54.496 --> 02:56.464
Help me!

03:13.982 --> 03:15.244
What's wrong?

03:23.124 --> 03:25.558
He's here. Run.

03:25.727 --> 03:27.194
Run!

03:28.229 --> 03:29.560
No!

03:31.266 --> 03:33.734
No! Don't let him take me!

04:40.001 --> 04:43.437
I dug holes. I used my x-ray vision,
but it's like she just vanished.

04:43.605 --> 04:45.698
Was anybody else out there with you?

04:45.874 --> 04:47.808
No. Just me.

04:48.076 --> 04:50.067
You were skinny-dipping alone?

04:51.579 --> 04:54.878
Well, it was kind of
a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing.

04:55.049 --> 04:57.483
All right, son,
I'll give the sheriff a call.

04:57.719 --> 04:59.710
Maybe I should skip school
and look for her.

05:00.054 --> 05:03.148
Clark, it's not your
responsibility to save everybody.

05:03.324 --> 05:05.019
Besides...

05:05.326 --> 05:07.590
...right now, we have a surprise for you.

05:07.962 --> 05:09.725
Outside.

05:16.971 --> 05:18.734
Wow, I didn't know
you got a new truck.

05:19.207 --> 05:21.141
It's not mine, Clark.

05:21.309 --> 05:22.571
It's yours.

05:22.744 --> 05:25.144
What? Oh, my God.

05:25.313 --> 05:26.575
Wait till I tell Pete.

05:26.748 --> 05:30.514
It's not just for fun, son. We needed
a new truck around here anyway.

05:30.685 --> 05:32.846
Well, how can we afford it?

05:33.021 --> 05:35.182
Well, the extra money
Lex gave us came in handy.

05:37.392 --> 05:39.917
Considering the source,
I'm surprised you used it.

05:40.094 --> 05:43.791
Yeah, I know. But I finally realized
that I wasn't giving him a fair shake.

05:43.965 --> 05:47.196
After all you've been through
the last couple of months...

05:47.368 --> 05:50.064
...we're really happy to have you home.

05:51.306 --> 05:53.103
I don't know what to say.

05:53.274 --> 05:55.469
Say that you will take good care of her?

05:56.177 --> 05:58.270
I'll take good care of her.

05:58.947 --> 06:00.209
-Thanks.
-All right.

06:00.381 --> 06:04.078
You better get to school. If Sheriff Adams
finds out anything about that girl...

06:04.252 --> 06:06.413
-...we'll let you know.
-Okay.

06:31.512 --> 06:32.843
Hey, Clark.

06:33.681 --> 06:35.273
Lana.

06:35.450 --> 06:38.647
-Look, about yesterday....
-Oh, it's okay.

06:39.387 --> 06:40.684
You're not mad?

06:40.855 --> 06:42.948
About you running off?

06:43.124 --> 06:45.684
No, I had a good view when you left.

06:46.094 --> 06:47.652
So who was screaming?

06:48.263 --> 06:50.754
-Some girl.
-ls she okay?

06:51.966 --> 06:54.161
I don't know.
She just kind of disappeared.

06:55.503 --> 06:57.471
I'm really sorry I just left you.

06:57.639 --> 06:58.901
Again.

06:59.841 --> 07:03.299
Well, it's not like we had a date
or anything.

07:03.478 --> 07:04.911
But I had fun.

07:08.383 --> 07:10.317
So did l.

07:10.952 --> 07:14.251
Our relationship has always
been about pain and angst.

07:14.422 --> 07:16.390
I guess a little levity is refreshing.

07:19.127 --> 07:22.824
Maybe after a while, you'll stop
torturing yourself and realize...

07:22.997 --> 07:26.160
...that there's no reason
why we shouldn't be together.

07:31.039 --> 07:32.438
It's okay, Clark.

07:34.242 --> 07:37.439
I'm willing to wait as long as you want.

07:48.756 --> 07:49.814
Hey.

07:51.426 --> 07:54.827
Hey, wait.
Hey, who are you?

07:55.596 --> 07:58.258
What happened? I saw
you get pulled into the ground.

07:58.766 --> 08:00.734
At least tell me your name.

08:01.336 --> 08:02.826
Sara.

08:03.004 --> 08:04.528
Sara Conroy.

08:05.340 --> 08:07.774
Okay, Sara, what's going on?

08:08.776 --> 08:11.643
-He's after me.
-Who?

08:12.113 --> 08:14.479
He's always after me.

08:21.089 --> 08:25.651
-Clark. Where were you?
-Pete, did you see that guy?

08:25.860 --> 08:27.521
-What guy?
-How could you miss him?

08:27.695 --> 08:31.256
He had a big red cape on.
He was standing right there.

08:31.432 --> 08:32.865
Sara, you must--

08:36.804 --> 08:38.101
Who's Sara?

08:38.306 --> 08:40.001
She was right there.

08:40.174 --> 08:43.268
The insanity defense.
It's working. I get it.

08:44.111 --> 08:45.807
I'm not insane.

08:45.980 --> 08:48.676
What do you call skipping an exam
worth 50% of your grade?

08:48.850 --> 08:51.182
-That's today?
-That was today.

08:51.652 --> 08:53.210
You flunked.

09:01.129 --> 09:02.619
Chloe, I need your help.

09:02.797 --> 09:04.697
Something came up
at the lake yesterday.

09:04.866 --> 09:06.925
Yeah, I heard.

09:07.101 --> 09:09.194
You are referring
to the Blue Lagoon moment...

09:09.370 --> 09:11.964
...with a certain
former girlfriend, right?

09:12.707 --> 09:17.076
-You know about that?
-This is high school. Everybody knows.

09:18.746 --> 09:20.577
The only--

09:22.116 --> 09:23.640
Did Sara Conroy tell you?

09:23.818 --> 09:26.480
Doubtful, since I've never
met anyone with that name.

09:26.921 --> 09:29.389
Well, she's a new student.
I think.

09:29.624 --> 09:32.286
I saw her in the woods,
and I just saw her in the hallway.

09:32.460 --> 09:34.690
She's definitely a candidate
for Wall of Weird.

09:34.862 --> 09:38.320
Well, that's too bad,
since the Wall of Weird has been retired.

09:41.536 --> 09:43.868
-Chloe, who did this?
-I did.

09:44.405 --> 09:46.737
It's time to leave childish
pursuits behind.

09:46.908 --> 09:48.341
You're not the only one who grew up.

09:48.509 --> 09:51.569
Besides, the Daily Planet was beginning
to frown on my obsession.

09:51.913 --> 09:54.279
-But we know these stories are true.
-Do we?

09:54.449 --> 09:57.941
-People have died because of that wall.
-And people have been saved too.

09:58.486 --> 10:00.078
I'm done chasing windmills, Clark.

10:00.254 --> 10:04.088
From now on, it's hard news
that can be backed up with facts.

10:14.268 --> 10:16.429
Lex, your message sounded urgent.

10:16.604 --> 10:18.265
Is something wrong?

10:18.973 --> 10:20.941
I'm not really sure.

10:21.108 --> 10:23.235
I'm having a rather strange day.

10:24.312 --> 10:26.075
Join the club.

10:27.181 --> 10:29.911
I was hoping you could help me
with a problem, Clark.

10:30.685 --> 10:32.482
What do you need?

10:33.054 --> 10:35.113
Would you hand me that sword?

10:42.129 --> 10:45.860
-ls this new?
-Depends on your definition.

10:47.468 --> 10:52.633
It was a ceremonial weapon used by
a group of 1 6th-century samurai warriors.

10:52.807 --> 10:54.331
The Katai.

10:54.509 --> 10:55.908
Ever heard of them?

10:56.978 --> 10:59.674
Japanese history
really isn't my strong suit.

11:01.115 --> 11:03.174
Let me give you your first lesson.

11:05.453 --> 11:10.857
Legend has it this sword was forged
in the fires of Mount Fuji.

11:11.759 --> 11:14.284
The blade can cut through anything.

11:17.498 --> 11:19.659
The Katai never took it into battle.

11:21.402 --> 11:23.063
They never had to.

11:24.305 --> 11:27.638
Till the day the strongest Katai
turned on his own.

11:28.743 --> 11:30.870
One by one, the Katai fell at his hand.

11:34.916 --> 11:37.350
Nothing left to lose...

11:37.518 --> 11:40.919
...the last of the Katai lunged
at the warrior with this sword...

11:42.323 --> 11:44.188
...the blade cut him clean in two.

11:44.792 --> 11:47.192
But when the warrior's armor fell away...

11:48.796 --> 11:51.560
...the Katai saw he wasn't even human.

12:06.013 --> 12:07.810
Just like you, Clark.

12:09.350 --> 12:12.012
See, I've always been honest with you.

12:12.186 --> 12:15.883
But it turns out you've been lying to me
from the first day I laid eyes on you.

12:18.926 --> 12:22.225
-No, Lex, I can explain.
-Too late!

12:23.864 --> 12:27.265
The irony is, all you had to do
was come to me, Clark.

12:28.002 --> 12:29.867
I was your friend.

12:30.338 --> 12:33.796
I would've protected your secret.
I would've protected you.

12:33.975 --> 12:35.840
But I couldn't be trusted.
I'm a Luthor.

12:36.010 --> 12:38.444
-No, that's not it.
-I don't care!

12:39.313 --> 12:41.281
I'm going to dedicate myself
to ensuring...

12:41.449 --> 12:43.883
...the whole world knows
who Clark Kent really is.

12:44.051 --> 12:46.713
Life as you know it is over.

12:51.492 --> 12:53.050
Lex.

12:54.395 --> 12:55.794
Lex!

13:06.974 --> 13:10.307
Mom! Dad! We got a big problem!

13:14.815 --> 13:16.646
Sara?

13:18.886 --> 13:20.217
What are you doing here?

13:20.388 --> 13:24.188
Lilacs. I haven't seen lilacs in years.

13:24.358 --> 13:27.452
They're my favorite.
My mother used to grow them for me.

13:28.696 --> 13:30.664
Where is your family?

13:31.899 --> 13:33.366
Listen.

13:33.901 --> 13:35.766
Please don't let him
take me again.

13:36.804 --> 13:38.066
Who?

13:39.040 --> 13:40.564
The Traveler, Clark.

13:41.575 --> 13:43.475
How do you know my name?

13:49.817 --> 13:51.978
Sara, you cannot escape me.

14:02.196 --> 14:06.132
No matter where you hide,
I will always find you.

14:07.034 --> 14:11.471
No! Please! No!

14:11.639 --> 14:13.368
Clark!

14:20.481 --> 14:22.381
No!

14:27.288 --> 14:30.519
Clark. Thank God,
we've been so worried.

14:31.726 --> 14:33.318
-What happened?
-You fell asleep...

14:33.494 --> 14:36.054
-...studying for your history exam.
-That was a day ago.

14:36.230 --> 14:39.256
-We've been trying to wake you since.
-You must've been dreaming.

14:39.433 --> 14:41.458
It was so real.

14:42.269 --> 14:45.727
I met this girl Sara Conroy,
and she was in trouble.

14:45.906 --> 14:48.898
Conroy. That's the name
of our new next-door neighbor.

14:49.076 --> 14:51.237
He has a teenage daughter.

14:51.946 --> 14:54.312
They moved into Lana's old house?

14:54.482 --> 14:57.007
There's been a moving truck
there since yesterday.

14:58.452 --> 15:01.182
How could I dream about someone
I've never even met?

15:24.111 --> 15:25.703
Wow.

15:25.880 --> 15:28.747
-Somebody's sure up early.
-Clark, have you been up all night?

15:28.916 --> 15:31.680
I was kind of afraid to go to sleep.

15:31.852 --> 15:33.945
I can't get over
how real that dream was.

15:34.121 --> 15:36.851
-I feel like checking on the Conroys.
-What would you say?

15:37.024 --> 15:39.322
-Sara was in danger in your dreams?
-Be careful.

15:39.493 --> 15:43.020
-Yeah. I gotta be careful when I'm sleeping.
-You weren't just asleep, son.

15:43.197 --> 15:44.459
You were out for 36 hours.

15:44.632 --> 15:47.999
That just happens to coincide
with that girl moving in next door?

15:48.169 --> 15:50.865
-You think she's keeping me asleep?
-I don't know, Clark.

15:51.038 --> 15:53.939
But with all the weird things going on,
you need to be careful.

15:54.108 --> 15:58.067
So, look, I'm asking you,
you stay away from the neighbors.

16:07.922 --> 16:10.220
Missed you at school
the last few days.

16:13.127 --> 16:15.186
I haven't been feeling so good.

16:16.163 --> 16:18.154
To be honest,
you look a little tired.

16:18.332 --> 16:20.163
-Maybe you should get some sleep.
-No.

16:22.369 --> 16:25.270
-I'll be fine.
-Okay.

16:25.472 --> 16:30.409
Well, I brought you your homework.

16:30.578 --> 16:33.240
Mr. Blair said that you could
make up your history exam...

16:33.414 --> 16:36.212
...as long as you have
a note from your parents.

16:37.451 --> 16:38.884
You're the best.

16:46.260 --> 16:49.718
-Can I tell you something?
-Sure.

16:51.298 --> 16:53.926
I had this dream,
and it's really freaking me out.

16:54.101 --> 16:55.591
What was it about?

16:55.769 --> 16:58.329
A lot of things. This girl.

17:00.207 --> 17:02.539
No, Lana, it's not like that.

17:02.710 --> 17:04.837
She needed help.

17:05.012 --> 17:07.344
Let me guess.
You had to save her.

17:07.513 --> 17:09.242
Except I couldn't.

17:09.415 --> 17:11.941
Her name's Sara,
and she moved into your old house.

17:12.118 --> 17:15.611
-When did you meet her?
-That's the thing. I haven't.

17:15.789 --> 17:17.915
How could I be dreaming about her?

17:19.894 --> 17:21.885
Maybe if you walked me
through the dream...

17:22.061 --> 17:24.121
...we could figure it out together.

17:24.298 --> 17:25.731
You don't think I'm nuts?

17:27.468 --> 17:29.698
Clark, I think you have a lot of issues...

17:29.870 --> 17:32.839
...but I do not think
you have lost your mind.

17:35.109 --> 17:38.909
-Okay, so where did you see her first?
-Crater Lake.

17:39.079 --> 17:42.913
-You were there.
-Really? What were we doing?

17:43.083 --> 17:45.017
Nothing.

17:45.185 --> 17:47.676
It's really hazy.

17:49.123 --> 17:52.217
Okay. Well, I have a better idea.

17:52.393 --> 17:55.123
Why don't we go see Sara in person?

18:07.107 --> 18:09.098
Wow, she seemed so....

18:13.247 --> 18:15.841
Do the doctors
think she'll come out of it?

18:16.016 --> 18:17.950
Well, there's always hope.

18:22.122 --> 18:25.319
It must be really hard
to see your daughter like this.

18:25.492 --> 18:27.483
Oh, Sara's my niece.

18:28.095 --> 18:31.258
So this is your old house, Lana.

18:32.132 --> 18:35.124
And you're the boy from next door.

18:35.302 --> 18:36.792
-What exactly happened?
-Clark.

18:36.971 --> 18:39.565
It's okay. It's no secret.

18:39.740 --> 18:41.332
It was a car accident.

18:41.508 --> 18:43.806
Sara and her parents
went off the Loeb Bridge...

18:43.978 --> 18:46.208
...on their way home
from a soccer game.

18:46.380 --> 18:50.714
The paramedics say Sara was asleep,
which is probably why she survived.

18:51.085 --> 18:53.781
-Sara's from Smallville?
-Grandville.

18:53.954 --> 18:55.717
Just over the county line.

18:55.889 --> 18:58.483
Lilacs. Those are Sara's favorite.

19:01.061 --> 19:02.460
Yes.

19:04.198 --> 19:06.029
How did you know that?

19:07.001 --> 19:09.060
They're my favorite too.

19:09.236 --> 19:12.171
It must be kismet,
living in the same house.

19:20.881 --> 19:22.974
That's an interesting medal.

19:23.584 --> 19:24.846
This?

19:25.586 --> 19:29.750
-Well, it's just good old St. Christopher.
-The patron saint of travelers, right?

19:30.591 --> 19:34.925
Yes, I say his prayer every night
in the hopes that Sara's journey will end...

19:35.095 --> 19:37.655
...and she'll come back to us.

19:39.633 --> 19:42.761
Look, I'm sorry.
You'll have to excuse me.

19:42.936 --> 19:45.268
It's time for Sara's medication.

19:46.807 --> 19:48.968
Thank you for stopping by.

20:11.065 --> 20:12.692
Dad, I thought I made it clear...

20:12.866 --> 20:16.427
...that I'm back, fully committed
to LuthorCorp and to you.

20:16.603 --> 20:18.662
And I'm delighted...

20:20.374 --> 20:22.171
...to hear it.

20:26.146 --> 20:28.637
Now, what's the problem?

20:28.816 --> 20:32.547
I've been blocked out of half
the computer files I need to do my job.

20:32.719 --> 20:34.846
Insufficient security clearance?

20:36.857 --> 20:38.449
Thank you, Meli.

20:42.563 --> 20:43.860
These...

20:45.966 --> 20:50.300
...security measures, Lex, are a necessary
evil. You should know that.

20:51.004 --> 20:53.529
-We have to protect our assets.
-From me?

20:53.874 --> 20:57.571
I applaud your renewed commitment
to LuthorCorp.

20:57.744 --> 21:02.044
After what you've been through,
it's remarkable.

21:02.216 --> 21:04.810
But you think I might betray you again.

21:06.553 --> 21:09.249
Betray me?
That's an interesting notion.

21:10.891 --> 21:12.518
Might you?

21:14.995 --> 21:16.758
I want this to work.

21:18.365 --> 21:20.333
I want us to be a family again.

21:20.501 --> 21:23.061
You have nothing to fear from me.

21:24.505 --> 21:28.168
Why have you refused to complete
the psychological profile?

21:29.042 --> 21:32.808
Come on, Dad. You've never believed
in that psychobabble, and neither do l.

21:32.980 --> 21:37.110
I believe that personal,
emotional problems...

21:37.284 --> 21:39.411
...may affect day-to-day decision-making.

21:39.586 --> 21:44.546
I think that dreams can often reveal
hidden dangers, serve as a warning--

21:44.725 --> 21:46.488
Spare me the Jungian cliff notes, Dad.

21:46.660 --> 21:48.958
It's five sessions, Lex. That's all.

21:49.963 --> 21:52.932
I thought you wanted
to reestablish our bond.

21:54.034 --> 21:55.399
I do.

21:55.569 --> 22:01.201
Then do it. Prove that my total
confidence in you is justified.

22:06.480 --> 22:08.448
Clark Kent dreaming of the girl next door.

22:08.615 --> 22:10.742
Isn't it nice to know
some things never change?

22:10.918 --> 22:12.545
Now I'm just trying to stay awake.

22:12.719 --> 22:17.088
Yeah, even Red Bull has its limits.
Trust me. I've tested them.

22:17.257 --> 22:20.090
I think Sara's reaching out
to me for help.

22:20.260 --> 22:22.160
Entering your dreams to communicate?

22:22.329 --> 22:26.163
How else would I know these details
of her life? Like the lilacs.

22:26.333 --> 22:29.894
There is a theory that telepathic
receptivity is increased during REM sleep.

22:30.070 --> 22:31.935
It has to do with frontal lobe activity.

22:32.105 --> 22:34.437
My frontal lobe is acting as a beacon.

22:34.608 --> 22:38.408
Well, I've never seen a case this dramatic,
but we all know that your brain...

22:38.579 --> 22:41.309
...is wired a little differently
than the rest of ours.

22:41.481 --> 22:45.417
Add that the river where she crashed
is a source for our favorite green stuff...

22:45.586 --> 22:48.851
...and you have the perfect Smallville
cocktail for weirdness.

22:49.022 --> 22:51.684
You think the meteor rocks
gave her this ability.

22:51.858 --> 22:53.655
Once she's in, she can keep you asleep.

22:53.827 --> 22:57.627
It certainly explains
the day-and-a-half snore-a-thon.

22:57.798 --> 23:00.892
I didn't wake up
until the Traveler appeared.

23:01.702 --> 23:02.930
And I think it's her uncle.

23:03.103 --> 23:05.663
Or a manifestation of fear
that she has for her uncle.

23:08.075 --> 23:11.101
Sorry. I didn't mean to get
all Freudian on you.

23:11.778 --> 23:14.941
No. Her uncle is all-powerful in her life.

23:15.115 --> 23:18.516
-Why wouldn't he be in her dreams?
-You're not buying the altruism angle?

23:19.286 --> 23:22.380
My faith in human kindness
is not what it used to be.

23:22.556 --> 23:26.322
Wanna go to the courthouse to see what
public records say about Uncle Nicholas?

23:26.493 --> 23:28.484
I have a deadline for the Daily Planet.

23:28.662 --> 23:31.722
And a Wall of Weird story doesn't
take precedence in their mind.

23:31.898 --> 23:34.765
-No time for childish pursuits anymore.
-Hey, that's not fair.

23:34.935 --> 23:36.527
You know that if I had a choice...

23:36.703 --> 23:40.161
...I would definitely be down there
pulling dusty records with you.

23:40.340 --> 23:42.604
I doubt that.
It's okay, I'll grab Lana.

23:42.776 --> 23:46.109
Yeah, at least she can provide
a constant source of caffeine.

23:59.159 --> 24:01.650
Now I know why
public records are public.

24:01.828 --> 24:03.455
They're incredibly boring.

24:03.630 --> 24:05.222
Not all of them.

24:05.399 --> 24:07.367
Take a look at this.

24:08.602 --> 24:11.366
Wow. Sara's parents were rich.

24:11.538 --> 24:13.403
When they died,
she inherited everything.

24:13.573 --> 24:15.768
One guess who's in control of the money.

24:15.942 --> 24:17.432
Uncle Nicholas.

24:18.378 --> 24:22.144
As long as she stays in a coma,
he controls the wealth.

24:23.083 --> 24:25.415
But he still hasn't done anything wrong.

24:25.585 --> 24:30.045
I mean, taking care of your niece and living
a nice life isn't exactly a smoking gun.

24:30.223 --> 24:32.714
Then why is Sara so scared of him?

24:32.893 --> 24:36.556
-I just don't get it.
-Hey, you're tired.

24:37.631 --> 24:39.997
I'm afraid to close my eyes.

24:41.001 --> 24:43.663
I'll go put on another pot of coffee.

24:46.506 --> 24:48.269
You don't have to stay.

24:49.443 --> 24:51.001
I want to, Clark.

25:10.897 --> 25:12.489
That was fast.

25:13.834 --> 25:16.029
-Sara.
-Hi.

25:17.671 --> 25:19.298
I must've fallen asleep.

25:20.107 --> 25:23.304
-Yeah.
-How do you get into my dreams?

25:24.444 --> 25:26.241
I don't know, Clark.

25:26.413 --> 25:29.473
This has never happened to me before.
I mean, just the other day...

25:29.649 --> 25:34.677
...suddenly I was in the woods and then
at school and then at your house....

25:34.855 --> 25:38.382
I realized what happened when
you and Lana came to see me.

25:38.558 --> 25:40.458
You can hear us?

25:41.228 --> 25:44.823
Yeah. It's like being
in a long, dark tunnel.

25:44.998 --> 25:48.900
I mean, sometimes it's open,
but sometimes it's not.

25:49.069 --> 25:50.900
I tried to reach out to you.

25:51.071 --> 25:54.006
You don't know what it's like
to be locked in your own body...

25:54.174 --> 25:56.074
...never any contact.

25:58.145 --> 26:00.613
Sara, who's the Traveler?

26:00.781 --> 26:03.909
Oh, we shouldn't talk about him.
He'll find us.

26:04.584 --> 26:05.846
Is it your uncle?

26:07.587 --> 26:10.579
Why are you so afraid of him?
What does he do to you?

26:10.757 --> 26:14.625
I don't know. I used to be able
to hear the doctors talking...

26:14.795 --> 26:16.922
...and they said I should've woken up.

26:17.097 --> 26:21.124
But every time I do feel just
a little bit better, he does something...

26:21.301 --> 26:23.792
...and I get sent back to a deep,
dark place...

26:23.970 --> 26:25.767
...that's like the bottom of the ocean.

26:27.140 --> 26:29.267
I almost woke up once.

26:29.643 --> 26:32.077
That's when he moved us here.

26:32.245 --> 26:34.770
Sara....

26:34.948 --> 26:36.779
God, he's here.

26:52.866 --> 26:54.766
Interesting theory, Clark.

26:54.935 --> 26:57.199
I know it sounds crazy,
but that's what happened.

26:57.370 --> 26:59.736
Now you're saving people
in your dreams too.

26:59.906 --> 27:01.806
A shrink would have
a field day with that.

27:01.975 --> 27:04.170
-You don't believe me?
-I believe you believe it...

27:04.344 --> 27:06.107
...and that's enough for me.

27:06.279 --> 27:10.272
You'll have to forgive me. I have
a personal bias against psychotherapy.

27:10.450 --> 27:12.918
You don't like
letting people in your head.

27:13.086 --> 27:14.348
Something like that.

27:14.521 --> 27:17.684
Well, this girl's in my head
until I figure out a way to help her.

27:17.858 --> 27:20.349
I made a few calls to Metropolis General.

27:20.527 --> 27:22.586
It's true. Sara was supposed to wake up.

27:22.762 --> 27:25.322
So her uncle is drugging her.

27:25.499 --> 27:27.558
They didn't have evidence of foul play...

27:27.734 --> 27:30.202
...but they've only performed
routine blood tests.

27:30.770 --> 27:32.431
Maybe the drug's untraceable.

27:32.606 --> 27:34.597
It doesn't appear
he's done anything wrong.

27:34.774 --> 27:37.709
We both know appearances
can be deceiving, Lex.

27:37.878 --> 27:40.176
Hearing it in a dream
won't get him arrested.

27:40.347 --> 27:42.144
I appreciate your help.

27:42.315 --> 27:43.782
Anytime.

27:48.622 --> 27:50.419
I always liked this sword.

27:51.124 --> 27:55.584
What is it, some sort of legendary
samurai antique?

27:55.762 --> 28:00.961
Hardly. It's a prop
from my favorite Kurosawa movie.

28:01.935 --> 28:03.527
Throne of Blood.

28:03.904 --> 28:05.838
I bought it at auction.

28:09.910 --> 28:12.606
Relax, Clark.
It can't hurt you.

28:12.779 --> 28:14.212
It's not real.

28:15.148 --> 28:16.775
Right.

28:17.617 --> 28:20.882
You've got to learn the difference
between reality and fantasy.

28:23.123 --> 28:24.750
Get some sleep.

28:31.731 --> 28:34.495
Clark. This is a pleasant surprise.

28:35.335 --> 28:38.065
I thought I'd bring Sara
some fresh flowers.

28:39.172 --> 28:40.537
Come in.

28:47.847 --> 28:49.678
This is real nice of you, Clark.

28:50.750 --> 28:53.048
Would you mind
if I sit with her for a while?

28:54.554 --> 28:56.249
Not at all.

29:00.894 --> 29:03.226
Can I get you something to drink?

29:03.730 --> 29:05.664
Anything with caffeine.

29:05.832 --> 29:07.823
I think I might have some soda.

30:04.758 --> 30:07.056
-Clark.
-Sara.

30:07.727 --> 30:09.888
He's so angry.

30:11.965 --> 30:15.765
Wait, if you're here, that means I'm....

30:37.957 --> 30:40.824
-Hello?
-Lana, hi. Come on in.

30:41.127 --> 30:43.061
I was looking for Clark.

30:43.229 --> 30:44.628
I brought him a pick-me-up.

30:44.798 --> 30:48.029
He's not back from Lex's,
but you're welcome to wait.

30:48.201 --> 30:49.463
Thanks.

30:51.638 --> 30:55.335
-So you finally have new neighbors.
-Yeah, not as good as the old ones.

30:58.178 --> 31:00.669
Mrs. Kent, could I ask you something?

31:00.847 --> 31:02.712
Of course, Lana.

31:12.125 --> 31:14.559
Do you know why
Clark pushed me away?

31:18.164 --> 31:20.359
Metropolis changed Clark.

31:21.367 --> 31:25.235
He's not the same boy he was
when he left this spring.

31:25.405 --> 31:27.566
Jonathan and I are trying
to figure it out too.

31:28.208 --> 31:31.268
I guess I just feel like...

31:31.678 --> 31:34.340
...if I stay in his orbit long enough...

31:34.514 --> 31:37.642
...he'll finally decide to open up.

31:39.252 --> 31:42.653
Martha! Come quick, it's Clark!

31:49.095 --> 31:50.619
Oh, my God!

31:50.797 --> 31:52.230
Jonathan!

31:53.266 --> 31:56.235
-What happened?
-He must've fallen asleep at the wheel.

31:56.402 --> 31:57.699
I'll call an ambulance.

31:57.871 --> 32:00.066
No, I think he just hit his head.
He'll be fine.

32:00.240 --> 32:03.175
Where was he coming from?
Lex's mansion is the other way.

32:03.343 --> 32:06.471
Oh, Clark, I told you
not to go to the Conroys.

32:06.646 --> 32:09.513
He was worried about Sara.
He kept seeing her in his dreams.

32:09.682 --> 32:11.115
It's my fault.
I took him there.

32:11.284 --> 32:15.186
Sweetie, don't blame yourself.
Clark will be fine.

32:15.688 --> 32:19.249
-What about Sara?
-I'm worried about her too.

32:32.305 --> 32:33.567
Sara, wait!

32:38.411 --> 32:41.073
-Sara!
-No!

32:41.414 --> 32:44.611
-We have to get away from him!
-You can't keep running.

32:45.785 --> 32:48.583
-I just want to be free!
-You can.

32:48.755 --> 32:51.656
In the real world.
You just have to face him.

32:53.760 --> 32:56.593
-I'm afraid.
-Sara, you're keeping us in this dream.

32:56.763 --> 32:59.960
I can't help you until I wake up.
I have no power.

33:00.133 --> 33:02.067
I'm sorry, Clark.

33:05.071 --> 33:06.333
Sara!

33:21.821 --> 33:24.585
How did he know about this?

33:25.992 --> 33:28.460
How did he know about the lilacs?

33:31.097 --> 33:35.158
I don't know what's going on
in there, but it's gonna stop.

33:37.570 --> 33:39.504
Don't put that needle in her.

33:44.310 --> 33:45.777
How did you get in here?

33:47.013 --> 33:49.413
We know you've been drugging Sara.

33:49.849 --> 33:51.282
Really.

33:53.019 --> 33:56.580
You and your boyfriend are a little
too neighborly for your own good.

33:56.756 --> 33:59.020
if you kill her, there's no more money.

33:59.792 --> 34:02.056
Who said anything about killing her?

34:29.822 --> 34:31.221
Sara, are you okay?

34:31.391 --> 34:33.518
I'm all right, Clark.

34:33.693 --> 34:35.320
She's in trouble.

34:36.129 --> 34:38.962
-Who?
-Lana.

34:44.504 --> 34:46.027
No.

35:01.721 --> 35:06.715
I warned you, Sara.
This is a fight you'll never win.

35:06.893 --> 35:09.191
-It's too late.
-Sara, we have to save Lana.

35:09.362 --> 35:12.490
He's too strong.
You can't stop him.

35:16.502 --> 35:18.993
Death will follow those who trespass.

35:19.172 --> 35:21.538
Sara! You have to help me!

35:28.081 --> 35:31.448
Sara, you cannot escape me.

35:32.785 --> 35:34.878
-Return with me.
-No.

35:35.054 --> 35:37.488
You're stronger than he is, Sara.
You know you are.

35:37.657 --> 35:39.124
-He cannot save you.
-Fight it!

35:39.292 --> 35:41.192
He did this to you.

35:41.361 --> 35:45.320
-Get angry. He took six years of your life.
-I control your destiny, Sara.

35:45.498 --> 35:49.298
Close your eyes
and return to your slumber.

35:49.469 --> 35:51.403
Don't be afraid, Sara.

35:52.338 --> 35:56.832
The more you resist, Sara,
the more you will suffer.

35:57.010 --> 35:59.808
I will not warn you again.

36:13.926 --> 36:15.450
Clark.

36:15.628 --> 36:17.687
Mom. Lana' s in trouble.

36:31.611 --> 36:32.600
Lana.

37:05.978 --> 37:07.639
Looking for this?

37:31.070 --> 37:32.594
Lex?

37:33.406 --> 37:35.237
What's so urgent?

37:35.408 --> 37:37.876
-I decided to do it.
-Do what?

37:39.112 --> 37:43.742
Meet with the psychiatrist,
submit to a full battery of mental tests.

37:43.916 --> 37:45.508
Curious.

37:46.786 --> 37:48.378
Tell me, what changed your mind?

37:48.554 --> 37:51.250
Because I was dealing
from a position of fear.

37:51.424 --> 37:54.951
If there's one thing you can sniff
out like a bloodhound, it's that.

37:55.128 --> 37:58.359
It's a gift, Lex, and it's useful.

38:00.600 --> 38:04.627
I know the only way I'm gonna
prove to you that I'm your rightful heir...

38:04.804 --> 38:07.364
...is to deal from a position of strength.

38:07.773 --> 38:09.070
I have nothing to hide.

38:11.744 --> 38:13.405
That would mean a lot to me, son.

38:14.881 --> 38:18.612
I figured, you're my father, and you
only have my best interests at heart.

38:18.784 --> 38:21.082
-Who's the good doctor?
-Claire Foster.

38:21.254 --> 38:25.691
Highly credentialed.
She's published a couple of books.

38:25.858 --> 38:28.588
She'll be able to help you
work through any problems.

38:31.197 --> 38:35.531
-That island didn't make me crazy, Dad.
-Crazy? No.

38:35.701 --> 38:37.635
Of course not.

38:40.173 --> 38:43.438
But it'll be good to have that
in writing, won't it?

38:49.348 --> 38:50.713
Lex.

38:53.819 --> 38:57.152
When you're rich, you're not crazy.

38:57.323 --> 38:58.915
You're eccentric.

39:22.782 --> 39:25.580
-Hi, Sara, how you doing?
-Hi.

39:28.187 --> 39:31.588
I brought you some fresh lilacs.
I know they're your favorite.

39:33.793 --> 39:35.852
It's Clark, isn't it?

39:36.262 --> 39:38.093
I didn't think you'd remember me.

39:38.264 --> 39:41.461
Yeah. We've been through
so much together...

39:41.634 --> 39:44.569
...even though we've never officially met.

39:44.737 --> 39:47.297
I still don't know
how I got in your dreams.

39:47.707 --> 39:50.801
The important thing is, you're safe.
And you're awake.

39:52.144 --> 39:54.942
You're obviously a special guy.

39:56.315 --> 39:59.443
I saw some of the things
you're able to do.

40:00.820 --> 40:03.186
Well, in our dreams, we're all super.

40:03.356 --> 40:04.618
I just....

40:05.358 --> 40:09.488
I know it's none of my business.
I know dreams are usually private.

40:10.696 --> 40:12.323
No.

40:16.435 --> 40:18.869
I'm curious to hear your perspective.

40:19.505 --> 40:21.132
What did you see?

40:22.541 --> 40:24.600
Someone who's clearly in love...

40:24.777 --> 40:26.938
...but who resists it.

40:27.713 --> 40:29.613
Lana, right?

40:33.786 --> 40:37.620
Clark, take it from someone
who's been trapped for six years.

40:37.790 --> 40:41.248
If you love her that much,
don't push her away.

40:43.362 --> 40:46.092
It's a long and complicated story, Sara.

40:46.265 --> 40:48.893
I only know what I saw.

40:49.068 --> 40:51.468
I may have been there...

40:53.506 --> 40:56.066
...but Lana's the girl of your dreams.

41:11.257 --> 41:13.521
Burning the midnight oil?

41:13.693 --> 41:18.027
I finally got some sleep.
My makeup history exam is tomorrow.

41:18.197 --> 41:22.463
-How are you feeling?
-Pretty stupid.

41:22.635 --> 41:24.102
Why?

41:24.537 --> 41:27.028
What you did was really brave.
You saved Sara's life.

41:27.206 --> 41:29.731
Yeah, and it almost cost me mine.

41:29.909 --> 41:31.433
It's lucky you got there.

41:32.278 --> 41:34.838
You believed in me when I thought
I was losing my mind.

41:35.014 --> 41:37.175
It was the least I could do.

41:38.551 --> 41:41.918
So I finally met Sara.

41:43.155 --> 41:45.589
All she could talk about was you.

41:46.792 --> 41:48.589
I told her I'd love to switch places.

41:48.761 --> 41:51.423
You know, find out what goes on
inside your head.

41:51.597 --> 41:53.224
It's not that exciting.

41:53.833 --> 41:57.667
Still, you know, maybe it would explain
why things between us....

41:58.738 --> 42:01.764
Lana, if I had the answers up here,
you'd be the first to know.

42:02.742 --> 42:06.838
You know, it's just the last few days
I felt like the girl next door again.

42:07.012 --> 42:08.479
And it was nice.

42:10.483 --> 42:12.451
Even though it almost got you killed?

42:16.489 --> 42:17.979
Lana.

42:19.291 --> 42:21.282
You'll always be the girl next door.

42:28.367 --> 42:31.598
So any chance we could
do something this weekend?

42:31.771 --> 42:33.170
You know, as friends?

42:34.273 --> 42:35.706
What did you have in mind?

42:36.375 --> 42:38.866
Well, it's been like an oven outside...

42:39.044 --> 42:42.343
...so I was thinking we could
go swimming at Crater Lake.

42:43.549 --> 42:47.280
I really don't think
skinny-dipping is a good idea.

42:49.021 --> 42:51.512
Who said anything
about skinny-dipping?

42:55.261 --> 42:57.752
Maybe in your dreams, Clark.
