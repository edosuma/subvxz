00:05.681 --> 00:06.655
You guys,

00:07.333 --> 00:10.637
Guess what all of us are
doing on sunday afternoon.

00:10.684 --> 00:14.120
Uh, I hope it's not
going antiquing again.

00:15.142 --> 00:17.864
I told you, Donna.
That's just for girls.

00:18.815 --> 00:20.842
Loved it.
Definitely in.

00:21.586 --> 00:23.156
No, during my radio show

00:23.192 --> 00:26.364
We did a promotion where the tenth
caller gets six tickets to the packers game.

00:26.440 --> 00:30.395
And since I turned off all the outside
phone lines after caller number nine,

00:30.645 --> 00:33.164
I was caller number ten.
We're going to the packers game !

00:34.816 --> 00:38.560
Oh, awesome ! We got six tickets,
and there's six of us !

00:39.713 --> 00:41.979
No, wait.
One, two, three...

00:42.050 --> 00:44.522
Fez, stop moving around.
You're confusing me.

00:45.187 --> 00:48.147
Wait, wait, wait. So we're
all gonna go to the game

00:49.518 --> 00:50.278
Together ?

00:50.314 --> 00:53.154
What, you won't go now 'cause
you and Hyde are broken up ?

00:53.582 --> 00:56.399
Well, I guess you'd rather stay
here and make sweet, short love to me.

00:57.152 --> 01:01.133
No, no, no, I'm fine with going, because
I'm the one who did the breaking up.

01:01.169 --> 01:03.260
Steven is the one
who's all devastated,

01:03.308 --> 01:05.721
So why don't you go make
sweet, short love to him?

01:07.380 --> 01:10.007
Um, I think something
got messed up here.

01:11.920 --> 01:14.095
Well, I'm going,
because I'm fine.

01:14.131 --> 01:16.032
Well, good, 'cause
I'm fine, too.

01:16.068 --> 01:18.457
In fact, I'm superfine.

01:18.939 --> 01:20.044
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:20.543 --> 01:22.433
I'm the one who's
superfine here, all right?

01:25.333 --> 01:27.817
I got the T-shirt that says so.

01:29.005 --> 01:33.256
Well, you also have a T-shirt that says "I'm with stupid,"
and the arrow's pointing straight up.

01:34.492 --> 01:37.099
Yeah, I hate that T-shirt.
It doesn't even make any sense.

01:37.134 --> 01:38.632
Who's above me?

01:42.257 --> 01:45.489
Okay, uh, I hate to
say it, you guys, but

01:45.703 --> 01:47.973
I think one of these tickets
has to go to my dad.

01:48.257 --> 01:51.193
So that means one of us
has to sit this out. Let me see.

01:51.252 --> 01:53.522
Eeny, meeny,
miney, Kelso.

01:54.354 --> 01:55.222
What?

01:55.400 --> 01:57.539
How could you choose
your dad over me?

01:57.575 --> 02:01.676
Look, my dad is a huge packers fan,
and he's never even been to a game.

02:01.723 --> 02:04.065
Forman, it's not a problem.
We can all go.

02:04.112 --> 02:06.869
Me, Kelso and Fez will
do the old ticket stub switch.

02:06.929 --> 02:08.259
That sounds dirty.

02:10.567 --> 02:11.625
Well, it's not.

02:12.920 --> 02:14.097
I'll do it anyway.

02:15.416 --> 02:18.768
What exactly sounds dirty
about "ticket stub switch"?

02:18.827 --> 02:20.032
Oh, come on.

02:21.196 --> 02:22.646
Stub, switch.

02:23.134 --> 02:24.417
What are you, frigid?

02:30.618 --> 02:32.210
Hey, dad, um,

02:32.246 --> 02:35.198
Say, could you give me a
ride this sunday afternoon at,

02:35.234 --> 02:36.660
I don't know, 1:00?

02:37.004 --> 02:38.811
Eric, this is football season.

02:38.835 --> 02:41.541
I know this doesn't mean much
to you since there are no

02:41.577 --> 02:43.966
Flying men with capes involved,

02:46.961 --> 02:50.717
But I can't drive you anywhere
on sunday until the spring.

02:51.002 --> 02:52.535
And then your mother can do it.

02:53.253 --> 02:56.711
Well, what if it was a ride
to legendary lambeau field

02:56.747 --> 03:00.051
Where the packers are playing the bears
and where you will be sitting next to me

03:00.087 --> 03:02.701
On the 50 yard line?

03:03.488 --> 03:04.270
Eric...

03:06.795 --> 03:08.766
What do you say, dad?
This'll be great, huh?

03:13.024 --> 03:13.897
Honey,

03:14.735 --> 03:16.364
Are you crying?

03:17.850 --> 03:18.617
No!

See this young man here?

03:59.873 --> 04:00.876
That's my boy.

04:01.100 --> 04:03.723
And he invited me to
come and see this game.

04:05.045 --> 04:06.000
I did that.

04:07.723 --> 04:08.655
That was me.

04:10.578 --> 04:13.219
Man, I can't go in there.
I've got all that stuff.

04:15.273 --> 04:17.007
Okay, listen, here's the plan.

04:17.053 --> 04:18.742
We've got two tickets,
and there's three of us.

04:18.789 --> 04:20.452
So I'm gonna go inside
with one of you guys.

04:20.476 --> 04:23.643
The guy who comes inside with me
takes the two stubs, comes back outside,

04:23.667 --> 04:26.062
Brings inside the guy who's
waiting outside. You got it?

04:29.404 --> 04:31.198
Why can't you wait outside?

04:31.870 --> 04:33.345
Yeah, why can't you?

04:33.581 --> 04:34.891
Because I have a ticket.

04:35.186 --> 04:36.767
- Oh, that makes sense.
- Okay, yeah.

04:39.096 --> 04:43.792
Okay, now to see who's coming in with me,
instead of drawing straws, we'll draw tickets, okay?

04:43.933 --> 04:45.833
So, Kelso, you go first.

04:46.742 --> 04:47.898
All right, I got one.

04:51.536 --> 04:52.410
Damn!

04:55.808 --> 04:56.386
Well,

04:57.188 --> 04:58.611
At leastit was fair.

05:03.933 --> 05:04.747
Jackie,

05:05.266 --> 05:07.353
Are you sure you're
okay being here with Hyde?

05:07.600 --> 05:09.536
Because I don't want you
to be sad the whole night.

05:10.125 --> 05:12.521
I have a feeling I'm gonna miss
a lot of this game if you're sad.

05:13.606 --> 05:16.963
Donna, please, okay? I'm past
the sad stage in the breakup.

05:17.222 --> 05:19.157
Now I just want
to make someone pay.

05:19.641 --> 05:23.346
Like when your uncle diedand you were
sad, so you hurt people by firing your maid?

05:24.338 --> 05:27.843
Okay, Donna, breaking up with Steven
was the hardest thing I ever had to do.

05:27.890 --> 05:31.678
I gave him my heart, and he stomped
on it. I can't pretend everything's okay.

05:31.737 --> 05:36.078
Oh, and we didn't fire Martina. We called
immigration and had them take care of it.

05:39.535 --> 05:41.966
Thanks again for inviting
me over for the game, Kitty.

05:41.989 --> 05:43.538
Well, it'll be fun.

05:43.574 --> 05:47.526
Red never lets me watch the game,
because one time seven years ago

05:47.550 --> 05:50.323
The Packers won at the last
minute while I was in the kitchen.

05:50.356 --> 05:53.400
Now I have to sit in the kitchen
every freakin' sunday.

05:55.500 --> 05:58.533
Okay, Kitty, I need the Packers
to win by more than 7.

05:58.568 --> 06:00.415
I got a hunsky
riding on it.

06:02.491 --> 06:05.405
We call them Hungarians now, Bob.

06:07.777 --> 06:09.704
No, I bet $100.

06:09.787 --> 06:11.049
Hey, you want in
for $10?

06:11.073 --> 06:12.324
Yes, please.

06:14.011 --> 06:16.253
Oh, I feel like
a gangster's wife.

06:17.256 --> 06:19.242
Ooh, how about
I get you some pretzels?

06:19.265 --> 06:20.420
I don't want to be
any trouble.

06:20.457 --> 06:22.121
Oh, it's no trouble
at all.

06:22.144 --> 06:23.242
You didn't
let me finish.

06:23.277 --> 06:26.027
I don't want to be any trouble, but
I'm gonna need something hot.

06:27.713 --> 06:31.350
Maybe something with refried beans
and a little cheese drizzled on it.

06:45.821 --> 06:47.792
You put a little schnapps
in the hot chocolate.

06:48.992 --> 06:52.391
Yeah, more like I put a little
hot chocolate in the schnapps.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.907
You kids talking
about booze?

06:56.662 --> 06:58.939
Well, schnapp it
over here.

07:02.007 --> 07:05.936
Eric, I think your dad's
been body-Snatched by a nice guy.

07:07.305 --> 07:08.155
I know.

07:08.320 --> 07:11.096
When the Packers got a first
down, he actually hugged me.

07:11.509 --> 07:12.666
It was, like,

07:13.126 --> 07:15.297
It was, like, warm, like
I imagined it might be.

07:19.506 --> 07:20.297
Hey,

07:20.899 --> 07:21.784
Kelso,

07:21.866 --> 07:23.860
Go bring in Fez now.
You know the plan, right?

07:23.908 --> 07:26.374
Take my stub and your
stuband bring him in.

07:26.397 --> 07:29.382
I got it, Hyde. Jeez,
I'm not 2, you know.

07:29.799 --> 07:32.407
Uh, what do I do
if I get lost?

07:33.068 --> 07:34.613
Dude, you're a cop.

07:35.014 --> 07:37.717
Yeah, what good is
shooting somebody if I'm lost?

07:38.554 --> 07:40.194
Hyde, you're no help.

07:43.144 --> 07:45.044
This is what
it's all about, huh ?

07:45.079 --> 07:47.923
Spending time
out here, us men.

07:48.466 --> 07:50.714
Eric, you should be
wearing a jersey. Here,

07:51.493 --> 07:52.732
Go buy yourself one.

07:55.104 --> 07:55.906
Whoa,

07:57.440 --> 07:58.564
Dad, thank you.

07:58.600 --> 07:59.733
Eric, please,

08:00.736 --> 08:02.352
Only on first downs.

08:09.563 --> 08:12.407
Wow, you actually got
food for everybody?

08:12.761 --> 08:14.991
How unnaturally
thoughtful of you.

08:15.935 --> 08:18.212
Oh, don't worry.
I have an ulterior motive.

08:18.255 --> 08:21.866
See, I got Steven caramel corn,
but Steven doesn't like caramel corn.

08:21.913 --> 08:24.072
And he knows I know
he doesn't like caramel corn,

08:24.120 --> 08:25.783
But I'm gonna
give it to him anyway.

08:27.635 --> 08:28.992
- Wicked.
- Yeah.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.640
Okay, boys,

08:31.688 --> 08:34.071
I got you all
your favorite snacks.

08:34.342 --> 08:36.525
Red, I got you a hot dog.

08:37.198 --> 08:38.057
Donna,

08:38.506 --> 08:40.642
I got you
three hot dogs.

08:46.128 --> 08:47.009
And,

08:47.669 --> 08:48.495
Steven,

08:49.475 --> 08:51.363
I got you
caramel corn.

08:52.720 --> 08:53.970
I don't like
caramel corn.

08:54.159 --> 08:55.106
Oh, my!

08:56.157 --> 09:01.195
Well, if I was still your girlfriend and not just someone
you couldn't see a future with, I might care.

09:03.205 --> 09:06.284
But I'm not, so I don't.
Buh-Burn!

09:11.500 --> 09:12.329
Hey, Red.

09:12.447 --> 09:14.324
Want to trade that hot dog
for the caramel corn?

09:14.359 --> 09:15.539
Yeah, sure.
I don't care.

09:18.040 --> 09:20.176
Damn ! I forgot
about tradesies.

09:23.560 --> 09:24.575
Now

09:25.401 --> 09:31.206
I could have sworn there was some refried
beans right here behind my emergency bourbon.

09:33.552 --> 09:37.564
Kitty, the game's on. I'll dip the
chips in crisco, whatever you got.

09:38.850 --> 09:40.077
Aw, Jeez!

09:40.113 --> 09:41.210
I got you.

09:49.753 --> 09:51.841
I wasn't falling, Bob.

09:53.666 --> 09:54.398
Oh.

09:56.628 --> 09:58.197
Well, then this is awkward.

10:01.371 --> 10:03.259
You can let go now, Bob.

10:19.098 --> 10:20.148
Where's Kelso?

10:20.644 --> 10:21.918
Outside, of course.

10:23.558 --> 10:24.337
Why?

10:24.555 --> 10:27.186
Um, we don't have
enough tickets.

10:30.690 --> 10:32.366
How can
you not get this?

10:34.401 --> 10:37.021
Moron, how many ticket
stubs do you have on you?

10:37.056 --> 10:40.478
I have two, mine and yours,
which, and try to keep up,

10:41.811 --> 10:44.481
Is why he's outside
and we're inside.

10:45.496 --> 10:50.169
Okay, good. Now go take both
ticket stubs and bring Kelso in.

10:50.747 --> 10:53.039
But then how would
you get into the game?

10:55.446 --> 10:57.912
I'm already in the
game! Now go!

10:57.948 --> 11:01.051
Okay, okay. But you catch
more flies with honey.

11:05.586 --> 11:07.297
Jackie wants to know

11:07.367 --> 11:10.541
If you could take a picture of
her having the best day of her life.

11:18.793 --> 11:20.091
Is she insane?

11:21.165 --> 11:23.104
Of course. What
are you, new here?

11:24.095 --> 11:24.933
Okay,

11:25.558 --> 11:30.384
Steven, now that I'm single, I am
very, very attractive to other men.

11:30.443 --> 11:33.375
And I don't want to make you
miserable or anything, but

11:33.410 --> 11:36.938
I think I'm gonna start dating one
of those big, stinky football fans.

11:37.174 --> 11:38.130
I'm single.

11:38.166 --> 11:39.971
No, not you, cheesehead.

11:41.833 --> 11:42.695
I mean...

11:42.766 --> 11:43.698
Whoo,

11:44.170 --> 11:45.491
Cheesehead!

11:47.214 --> 11:48.701
Uh, forget it. Oh!

11:50.766 --> 11:53.503
Why isn't this working?
What is wrong with me?

11:53.551 --> 11:54.554
I don't know.

11:54.849 --> 11:57.610
You don't have that normal
Jackie thing that you usually have.

11:57.893 --> 12:01.067
You know, most of the time, when you put
your mind to it, you can really hurt someone.

12:02.381 --> 12:03.183
Okay,

12:03.431 --> 12:07.348
Do you remember Ashley Caldwell when she
was talking about you behind your back?

12:07.384 --> 12:09.160
And then you told
all the other cheerleaders

12:09.214 --> 12:12.405
The reason that she couldn't do
a split is because she had a wiener?

12:17.413 --> 12:18.074
Well,

12:18.275 --> 12:19.596
Yeah, but, Donna,

12:19.631 --> 12:22.381
That was easy. I really
wanted to hurt her.

12:23.490 --> 12:25.401
And you don't really
want to hurt Hyde?

12:26.168 --> 12:28.012
Because you
still love him?

12:30.962 --> 12:33.452
Hey, some jerk's wearing
a Bears jersey!

12:33.487 --> 12:35.567
Let's all get together
and kick his ass!

12:40.134 --> 12:40.889
Man,

12:41.302 --> 12:44.456
All these guys are pissed off
at something, huh, dad?

12:45.129 --> 12:45.943
Dad?

12:46.556 --> 12:48.244
Who is this guy?

12:49.306 --> 12:50.821
Bears, boo!

12:50.904 --> 12:51.942
- Boo !
- Boo !

13:04.999 --> 13:05.849
Eric,

13:05.896 --> 13:09.389
How the hell can you wear
a Bears jersey at a packer game?

13:10.144 --> 13:12.433
Okay, maybe he doesn't
understand why it's wrong.

13:12.787 --> 13:15.142
Let me tell you in a way
how you can understand.

13:16.747 --> 13:19.189
The Packers
are like the Jedi.

13:24.310 --> 13:28.010
And you're wearing
a go, Darth Vader jersey.

13:28.765 --> 13:30.405
Uh, that's ridiculous.

13:30.535 --> 13:32.682
The Jedi don't play football.

13:33.449 --> 13:35.258
They play manu-Ka.

13:37.252 --> 13:38.090
Forman,

13:38.408 --> 13:42.255
This is worse than when you wore the
air supply T-shirt to the Aerosmith concert.

13:42.650 --> 13:46.395
For god sakes, will you just
take the damn jersey off?

13:46.430 --> 13:51.256
No. You know what? I like rooting for the
underdog, okay? I am the underdog in real life.

13:51.292 --> 13:54.183
I like Charlie Brown. I like
the little engine that could.

13:55.543 --> 13:56.770
I like the Bears.

13:57.466 --> 13:59.850
Excuse me, excuse me.

14:00.558 --> 14:02.210
Hey, I'm back.

14:10.303 --> 14:10.987
Uh,

14:12.391 --> 14:13.394
Where's Fez?

14:13.665 --> 14:15.990
Oh, I left him outside
like we always do.

14:19.011 --> 14:23.370
But I like how you made him come in and out just
to make him think we weren't screwing with him.

14:23.653 --> 14:24.904
Burn!

14:28.762 --> 14:31.040
Kelso, we're not trying
to burn Fez.

14:31.087 --> 14:33.430
We're just trying to all
watch the game together.

14:34.279 --> 14:36.875
Okay, this is Kelso
you're talking to here.

14:37.678 --> 14:41.312
All right, who's getting burned? Is it me?
Because if it is, I'll just let it happen.

14:42.468 --> 14:45.919
No, no one's getting burned.
Now go out and get Fez!

14:46.674 --> 14:48.315
All right, fine.

14:49.034 --> 14:51.630
I'll go get Fez, and you
can just surprise me.

14:56.170 --> 14:57.385
Okay, Steven,

14:57.904 --> 15:02.081
Certain people have implied
that I might still have feelings for you,

15:02.128 --> 15:05.213
But I want you to know
that I don't. In fact,

15:05.261 --> 15:09.760
Now that I'm single, I realize how big of a
loser you are, and I'm lucky to be rid of you.

15:09.808 --> 15:14.032
So I'm gonna go and celebrate with
a giant gold-And-Green cotton candy!

15:20.009 --> 15:23.100
Man, what the hell is her problem?
She's ruining the football game.

15:24.021 --> 15:26.569
I'm gonna go tell her where
she can stick that cotton candy.

15:28.960 --> 15:30.930
This is a very angry
section we're in.

15:31.957 --> 15:32.960
Very angry.

15:33.975 --> 15:36.881
Oh, it's not that bad. I mean, I've been
wearing this jersey ten minutes, and

15:36.905 --> 15:38.368
Nothing that bad
has happened.

15:41.448 --> 15:43.984
Although I did
just sit in nachos.

15:45.442 --> 15:46.905
Good one, Red!

16:18.127 --> 16:21.325
All right, Kitty, I think we need to talk
about what happened in the kitchen.

16:21.431 --> 16:23.744
Yeah, what the heck
were you doing, Bob?

16:24.829 --> 16:27.708
I haven't been goosed like
that since we won the war.

16:29.282 --> 16:30.898
I thought
you were falling.

16:30.945 --> 16:33.600
I wasn't falling. Why would
you think I was falling?

16:33.836 --> 16:37.506
You said, "Oh, Jeez," and that's what
I say when I'm gonna fall. "Oh, Jeez."

16:37.815 --> 16:41.591
I just said that because I couldn't
find your damn refried beans.

16:42.830 --> 16:44.883
And both hands, Bob?

16:45.402 --> 16:47.101
I needed leverage.

16:49.610 --> 16:52.217
Well, all I know is we have
to keep this a secret.

16:52.253 --> 16:55.096
If Red finds out,
he'll cut your hands off.

16:56.500 --> 16:57.220
Fine,

16:57.633 --> 16:59.371
We won't say
another word about it.

17:01.943 --> 17:04.492
Although about it,
may I say bravo.

17:08.378 --> 17:09.582
Jane Fonda.

17:15.540 --> 17:16.202
Hey,

17:16.921 --> 17:18.859
- What happened with Jackie ?
- Huh?

17:19.118 --> 17:20.617
Oh, nothing. I didn't find her.

17:21.195 --> 17:22.777
You might want to go
to look for her, though,

17:22.978 --> 17:24.310
By the snack bar.

17:25.809 --> 17:28.102
Behind the pillar,
concourse "A."

17:29.187 --> 17:31.075
Is that close to the
ice cream guy?

17:32.161 --> 17:32.998
I think so.

17:34.273 --> 17:35.488
All right, I'll go.

17:43.407 --> 17:44.847
Hyde, we need help.

17:45.743 --> 17:48.373
This whole ticket thing
is like calculus to us.

17:49.152 --> 17:52.573
Okay, Kelso is outside
with two ticket stubs.

17:52.609 --> 17:53.317
What?

17:54.414 --> 17:55.594
How did you get in?

17:55.645 --> 17:57.072
Oh, there's a hole
in the fence.

18:04.506 --> 18:05.288
Come on.

18:11.837 --> 18:15.454
Well, the Bears have pretty much lost
the game, so why don't you get lost?

18:15.489 --> 18:17.223
Look, I think you've
made your point.

18:17.259 --> 18:20.362
Yes, he's wearing
a Bears jersey,

18:20.657 --> 18:21.861
But he's my son.

18:21.896 --> 18:23.607
Son or daughter?

18:24.032 --> 18:26.065
All right, that's enough!

18:26.100 --> 18:28.184
No, you know what? You can say
anything you want about me, okay?

18:28.220 --> 18:29.308
It's not gonna bother me.

18:29.362 --> 18:31.221
Yeah, stay out of this, baldy.

18:32.578 --> 18:33.555
Okay,

18:33.591 --> 18:35.331
You can shut up
about my dad.

18:35.378 --> 18:37.361
Oh, well, who's
gonna make me?

18:37.396 --> 18:38.269
I am.

18:38.434 --> 18:39.614
No, wait,

18:39.748 --> 18:40.527
I am.

18:44.756 --> 18:46.164
Ooh! Eric's in a fight!

18:51.202 --> 18:52.453
No one's here!

18:52.665 --> 18:54.324
No one's gonna believe me!

18:54.984 --> 18:57.085
Why didn't I bring
my camera?

19:00.105 --> 19:02.256
Today was a miserable day.

19:02.315 --> 19:05.536
Now I want to hire Martina
back just so I can fire her again.

19:07.200 --> 19:08.828
You know what might
make you feel better?

19:08.879 --> 19:12.254
If you go wait in the car, while
I go watch the rest of the game.

19:13.339 --> 19:15.687
No, that's okay. You can come with me.

19:16.788 --> 19:17.567
Great.

19:20.505 --> 19:22.546
I'm vicious, all right!

19:25.366 --> 19:27.450
I will tear that ass up!

19:27.981 --> 19:29.574
Look at him go.

19:29.598 --> 19:31.450
He's got the Forman rage.

19:31.497 --> 19:33.102
Get off of me!

19:46.060 --> 19:46.851
Come on,

19:47.311 --> 19:49.871
Let's go tell your mom
about our day. Oh, hey,

19:50.084 --> 19:52.255
Where'd you learn all those
fighting moves, by the way?

19:53.364 --> 19:54.296
Spider-Man.

19:57.115 --> 19:58.354
I had to ask.

19:59.074 --> 20:03.546
Hey, Donna, you know, Fez and I are
free if you want tickets to a movie.

20:03.581 --> 20:04.679
Sure.

20:04.726 --> 20:07.412
But I only have enough money
for, like, two tickets.

20:09.583 --> 20:11.660
No problem. I know this
thing we can do.

20:13.251 --> 20:15.404
First, you take two tickets
and go inside,

20:15.451 --> 20:17.882
And then we wait outside
and sneak through the fence.

20:20.235 --> 20:21.738
Sounds foolproof.

20:22.718 --> 20:25.479
We are gonna
burn Fez so bad.

20:35.894 --> 20:37.227
Well, this sucks,

20:39.976 --> 20:42.214
'Cause before
we'd just kind of

20:43.476 --> 20:44.703
Hang out, you know?

20:44.739 --> 20:45.482
Yeah,

20:46.096 --> 20:47.335
Well, that was before.

20:47.818 --> 20:50.296
Obviously, hanging out
doesn't work so well now.

20:50.332 --> 20:51.130
Yeah.

20:52.156 --> 20:53.371
Want me to give
you a ride home?

20:53.560 --> 20:54.551
No, that's okay.

20:55.283 --> 20:56.321
I don't mind.

20:57.572 --> 20:58.665
No, I'll walk.

21:00.577 --> 21:01.485
But thank you.

21:06.244 --> 21:10.162
I can't believe you sat on my
couch with cheese on your pants!

21:11.778 --> 21:13.041
Okay, listen, mom,

21:13.548 --> 21:16.097
Cheese on my pants
is just who I am now.

21:16.938 --> 21:20.584
No more spending time with your
father. He's turned you into an animal.

21:25.040 --> 21:28.957
I can't believe you
got into a fight.

21:29.512 --> 21:31.636
You know, I'm thinking
about becoming a boxer.

21:32.462 --> 21:34.849
They may have to invent
a whole new weight class.

21:35.038 --> 21:35.793
Hey,

21:36.289 --> 21:38.117
What's lighter
than a feather?

21:39.840 --> 21:42.637
A packer win, and the boy
defends the family name.

21:42.672 --> 21:45.046
This is a great
day for the Formans.

21:45.553 --> 21:47.004
I touched your wife's butt.

21:51.939 --> 21:53.744
I made $10.

21:54.305 --> 22:00.604
