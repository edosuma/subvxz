- There he is.
- Spidey!

01:25.967 --> 01:28.067
With those long legs,
he does look like a spider.

[ Chuckles ]

01:29.500 --> 01:30.867
And just as creepy.

- [ Girl ] I hear he sleeps in there.
- [ Boy #2 ] I heard that too.

Come on, you guys.

- [ Gasps ] There he is!
- Very funny.

- I did not.

- Yeah, you did.
- Bird, be quiet.

- Hey, Bird!
- Yeah, what?

02:39.600 --> 02:42.467

- Cool camera!

- That was close.
- That was too close.

03:51.533 --> 03:55.200
I'm never ever doing anything
like that again.

03:55.700 --> 03:58.267
- Me neither.
- Greg, you took the camera!

03:58.767 --> 04:01.767
- I didn't even notice I had it.
- [ Girl ] We gotta put it back.

04:01.767 --> 04:04.100
[ Bird ] Well, ain't no way
we're goin' back now.

04:06.567 --> 04:08.800

It's a great action shot.

04:11.567 --> 04:13.700
Yeah, but...
I took the picture before you fell.

No, well, maybe
you only thought you did.

- I think it's excellent.
- What's that?

05:01.400 --> 05:05.400
Oh, just a camera.
Somethin' Shari gave me.

05:05.400 --> 05:10.033

It's a new process.

05:50.567 --> 05:52.533
Hey, is that picture ready yet?

Mmm, nuh-uh. I haven't taken

- Hmm?
- [ Chuckles ]

06:30.500 --> 06:32.333
I think you should take it back.

06:32.767 --> 06:33.700
Uh, just because, um,

06:34.200 --> 06:37.133
think how bad you would feel
if you got a scratch on it.

06:37.133 --> 06:40.900
And besides, it's too shiny.
It hurts my eyes.

ever since he came home.

- No weirder than usual. [ Scoffs ]

thrilled about the car.

you should slow down?

- We're only going 35, Greg.
- Yeah, put the pedal to the metal.

07:17.900 --> 07:20.700
- But watch the speed limit.
- What speed limit?

[ Scoffs ]
I'm not buying it.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.500

predicts the future or something.

09:26.500 --> 09:29.500

then I'll make a prediction.

[ Sighs ] No, but--
I mean, look at this thing.

the film, or no way to even open it.

- Thanks.

10:12.567 --> 10:14.500
Come on, Joey. Give it back.
It's not mine.

10:14.500 --> 10:16.767
That's 'cause it's mine.

10:16.767 --> 10:20.033
I don't think so.
Finders keepers, pal.

- Don't do it!
- What?

Well, because your face
is gonna break the camera.

to be permanent, Fish?

you brought the camera,

- Uh, earlier today at her house.

- Do you know where she is now?
- At her house, I guess.

must have happened to her.

- Well, um, because you guys are here.

I saw her was at her house.

- Is that the picture you took?

- Um, yeah, it is. But I--
- Can I see it, please?

- Just give her the picture.

a real bad photographer.

The camera knew, Bird. It knew
that Shari was gonna disappear.

14:38.900 --> 14:41.733
- Oh, man.
- No, no, look. Don't you get it?

14:43.233 --> 14:46.733
I-it predicts the future,
and it makes it bad.

14:46.733 --> 14:48.733
You gotta believe me.

14:48.733 --> 14:51.767
- Why didn't you tell the police?
- They'd think I was nuts.

14:53.267 --> 14:55.767
A-and now Shari's disappeared.

14:55.767 --> 14:58.500
It's all my fault.

Not a scratch.

Toss it. Throw it away.

15:25.100 --> 15:28.067
Man, then what if someone finds it
and takes a picture with it?

15:28.067 --> 15:31.633
Maybe it belongs to Spidey, and he
kidnapped Shari because we took it.

15:32.133 --> 15:34.067
Well, that's more of a reason
to take it back.

- Didn't Spidey kidnap you?
- No.

16:40.900 --> 16:45.900
It's so unreal. All of a sudden,
I was back in my backyard.

16:45.900 --> 16:49.400
[ Scoffs ]
I don't even know where I was.

16:49.400 --> 16:53.900
My parents are really upset.
They think I did it on purpose.

16:53.900 --> 16:56.667
When? I mean,
when did you come back?

16:57.167 --> 16:59.600
I don't know.
A few hours ago.

17:00.100 --> 17:03.100
That's about when
I tore up your photograph.

17:03.100 --> 17:06.367
It's the camera.
It made you disappear.

17:07.867 --> 17:09.900
I'm gonna bring it back.

17:10.900 --> 17:13.532
Yeah, I know. Bird told me.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.900
I couldn't let you do it by yourself.

17:16.900 --> 17:19.867
- Thanks. Come on.
- [ Cat Yowls ]

17:19.867 --> 17:22.200
Let's get this over with.

17:31.700 --> 17:35.300
[ Greg ] Okay.
I don't see Spidey. Come on.

17:35.300 --> 17:37.800
- [ Clattering ]
- What was that?

17:39.300 --> 17:42.667
I don't know. Come on.
Let's just do this and get out.

17:42.667 --> 17:44.167
Okay.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.167
[ Both Scream ]

17:51.300 --> 17:53.667
Primitive tribes fear the camera.

17:54.167 --> 17:58.367
They believe that if it takes their
picture, it will steal their soul.

17:58.367 --> 18:01.800
This camera is far worse,
far worse, far worse.

18:02.300 --> 18:04.967
We were just gonna bring it back.

18:04.967 --> 18:07.067
I figured you might,

18:07.067 --> 18:11.600
once you discovered
the kind of pictures it takes.

18:12.467 --> 18:14.933
[ Gasps ]

18:14.933 --> 18:17.467
Give it to me.

18:22.833 --> 18:28.333
A camera that predicts the future.
[ Chuckles ]

18:30.333 --> 18:32.567
It should have made me my fortune.

18:32.567 --> 18:35.033
- You invented it?
- What?

18:35.033 --> 18:39.033
Do you think I've always been a
wretched creature slinking about at night?

18:39.533 --> 18:42.633
Yes! Yes.

18:45.133 --> 18:47.700
Yes. [ Sighs ]

18:47.700 --> 18:52.667
I soon discovered it not only predicted
the future, it made it happen.

18:54.167 --> 18:57.167
And it was always disastrous.

18:58.667 --> 19:03.300
It can't be destroyed. That's why
I've kept it hidden all these years.

19:03.800 --> 19:07.967
Yeah, well, uh, it's back now, so--
Sorry we caused you so much trouble.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.600
Afraid that won't be possible.

19:13.600 --> 19:15.600
You got your camera back.
What else do you want?

19:15.600 --> 19:17.833
You know too much.
I can't let you leave.

19:17.833 --> 19:20.967
I've worked too long and hard
to keep this camera a secret.

19:21.467 --> 19:24.967
You don't have to worry.
Your secret's safe with us.

19:24.967 --> 19:28.133
- We won't tell anyone.
- I can't risk that.

19:28.133 --> 19:31.500
You can't keep us here forever.

19:33.500 --> 19:36.333
I'm sorry.
I have no choice.

19:38.333 --> 19:40.667
- [ Grunting ]
- No!

19:42.900 --> 19:45.733
[ Camera Warbling ]

19:45.733 --> 19:48.333
No!

19:51.400 --> 19:53.833
- Where'd he go?
- I-I don't know.

19:54.833 --> 19:56.833
But let's get out of here.

19:56.833 --> 19:58.867
[ Footsteps Departing ]

20:03.867 --> 20:06.167
[ Spidey's Voice ]
Release me!

20:06.600 --> 20:10.100
Release me!

20:10.100 --> 20:12.800
Someone! Anyone!

20:13.300 --> 20:16.767
Release me!

20:21.267 --> 20:23.233
[ Dog Barking ]

20:36.233 --> 20:39.233
[ Chuckles ]
Here it is.

20:39.233 --> 20:42.733
[ Chuckles ] Those jerks actually
thought they could hide it from us.

20:42.733 --> 20:45.733
- [ Chuckles ]
- Ah, here. Take my picture.

20:49.333 --> 20:51.267
All right.

20:51.267 --> 20:54.167
Say "Cheese."

20:54.167 --> 20:57.667
[ Camera Warbles ]

21:00.467 --> 21:02.900
Okay. Let's see.

21:02.900 --> 21:05.400
[ Chuckles ]

21:06.900 --> 21:09.400
[ Spidey Laughing ]
