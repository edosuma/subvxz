00:47.046 --> 00:48.913
What are you doing here?

00:48.981 --> 00:50.815
Doing what I promised to do.

00:52.718 --> 00:54.151
Looking after the crown.

00:56.456 --> 00:58.856
Is it a royal crown?

00:58.925 --> 00:59.924
Sort of.

00:59.992 --> 01:01.358
You know about this place?

01:01.427 --> 01:03.360
Yes.

01:03.429 --> 01:05.729
But I swore to keep it a secret...

01:05.798 --> 01:06.730
to William.

01:06.799 --> 01:08.232
Evie's father?

01:08.301 --> 01:09.366
That's right.

01:09.435 --> 01:10.968
But why is it in our house?

01:11.037 --> 01:14.038
Because this is the best place
to keep it safe.

01:15.908 --> 01:18.409
(ERIK) How did you find it?

01:18.478 --> 01:19.977
Long story.

01:20.046 --> 01:22.446
So, whose crown is it anyway?

01:22.515 --> 01:23.914
Well...

01:25.384 --> 01:28.419
The rightful owner of this crown...

01:35.595 --> 01:37.461
...is Evie.

01:42.768 --> 01:43.834
Wow.

01:47.273 --> 01:48.839
Your Majesty.

01:50.443 --> 01:52.877
And it's of the utmost importance

01:52.945 --> 01:55.613
that the crown remain safe.

01:59.218 --> 02:02.286
♪♪

02:06.025 --> 02:08.425
So Evie's father William Ruybosch.

02:08.494 --> 02:10.995
was leader of the Relatives.

02:11.062 --> 02:14.398
official rules dictate that
when a leader passes away

02:14.467 --> 02:18.536
his crown, or his leadership
passes on to the next of kin.

02:18.604 --> 02:20.037
In this case...

02:20.106 --> 02:21.171
It's Evie.

02:21.240 --> 02:22.172
Exactly.

02:22.241 --> 02:23.173
You're a queen, Evie.

02:23.242 --> 02:24.909
Can I be a princess too?

02:24.977 --> 02:26.911
You're a queen, you can
be whatever you want.

02:26.979 --> 02:29.280
Even a queen princess.

02:29.348 --> 02:31.582
So, Kate, did you know about this?

02:31.651 --> 02:34.985
I knew Erik swore to protect
the crown in secret, yes.

02:35.054 --> 02:37.588
But why hide the crown
if it belongs to Evie?

02:37.657 --> 02:38.756
To keep it safe.

02:40.393 --> 02:42.426
Evie's too young to lead the Relatives

02:42.495 --> 02:44.995
so a temporary leader is appointed.

02:45.064 --> 02:47.798
And Evie's father decided
that that should be...

02:47.867 --> 02:49.867
Me.

02:49.936 --> 02:52.436
Just until Evie's
old enough to lead herself.

02:52.505 --> 02:54.605
So you're the leader
of the Relatives now?

02:54.674 --> 02:55.673
No.

02:55.741 --> 02:57.608
I'm just here to look after Evie's

02:57.677 --> 03:00.144
and the Relatives' interests.

03:00.212 --> 03:01.612
But...

03:01.681 --> 03:03.480
since I'm being accused of a crime...

03:03.549 --> 03:04.915
Falsely accused.

03:04.984 --> 03:07.184
...I'm not allowed to lead.

03:07.253 --> 03:10.321
And since Evie's too young to lead...

03:10.389 --> 03:11.922
There's a power vacuum.

03:11.991 --> 03:15.392
Oh, man. Power vacuum, that's the worst.

03:15.461 --> 03:17.595
I once got my hand
stuck in a vacuum cleaner.

03:17.663 --> 03:20.164
- Remember?
- Yeah, and I had
to pull you out,

03:20.232 --> 03:21.765
but I don't think this
is the same thing.

03:21.834 --> 03:25.269
A power vacuum means no one is in power

03:25.338 --> 03:27.671
and anyone can step in...

03:27.740 --> 03:29.406
for better... or worse.

03:30.543 --> 03:32.876
So if someone got their
hands on the crown.

03:32.945 --> 03:35.245
They could become leader
of the Relatives

03:35.314 --> 03:37.214
<i>before Evie gets a chance to.</i>

03:37.283 --> 03:40.084
So someone's trying to become
leader of the Relatives

03:40.152 --> 03:41.452
by framing you for a crime.

03:41.520 --> 03:46.957
Exactly. But worst of all,
I'm the appointed guard of Evie,

03:47.026 --> 03:48.492
if I go to jail,

03:48.561 --> 03:51.528
the Relatives might find
a different guardian for Evie.

03:51.597 --> 03:52.997
But Evie has to stay with us.

03:53.065 --> 03:53.998
Of course.

03:54.066 --> 03:57.768
Which means I need to prevent the crown

03:57.837 --> 03:59.770
from falling into the wrong hands

03:59.839 --> 04:01.739
and stay out of jail

04:01.807 --> 04:04.642
or Evie could get a different guardian.

04:05.911 --> 04:09.113
I'd better put the crown back.

04:09.181 --> 04:13.150
Now luckily for us,
no one knows where it's hidden.
