00:20.000 --> 00:22.917
<i>Witness, if you will, a ghost town.</i>

00:23.721 --> 00:26.060
<i>A very advanced ghost town.</i>

00:26.120 --> 00:28.826
The architecture may indicate
an Earth ancestry.

00:33.201 --> 00:35.490
Aw, man!

00:36.479 --> 00:38.104
Any idea what this is?

00:38.161 --> 00:42.408
I hate to say it, sir, but it seems like
they might have a bit of a pigeon problem.

00:44.121 --> 00:46.851
I don't see pigeons.
There should be a lot of 'em.

00:46.920 --> 00:49.923
Well, whatever did this
did so pretty recently.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.215
Perhaps they suffered the same fate
as the inhabitants of this city.

00:54.322 --> 00:56.564
Conjecture, Captain?

00:58.481 --> 01:01.563
My data's consistent with the probe, sir.

01:01.642 --> 01:04.721
No radiation - the air's
almost 100% pollution-free.

01:04.801 --> 01:09.483
Teal'c, it doesn't seem very likely that
the Goa'uld are responsible for this.

01:09.602 --> 01:13.152
I mean, what with the indigenous people
of this planet being... gone.

01:13.242 --> 01:15.150
That is correct.

01:15.201 --> 01:18.206
A Goa'uld attack would have
resulted in much more damage.

01:18.283 --> 01:20.817
Any technology
would have been destroyed.

01:20.882 --> 01:22.257
Wow!

01:23.322 --> 01:24.945
You guys hear that?

01:42.323 --> 01:43.319
Ow!

01:45.121 --> 01:46.664
What are you gonna do?

02:03.082 --> 02:05.123
Aarrghh!

02:06.283 --> 02:08.359
- Carter, Novocaine.
- Sir.

02:09.801 --> 02:11.753
We'd better get outta here.

02:11.804 --> 02:13.180
No, really

02:13.242 --> 02:15.116
<i>No... Really.</i>

02:18.524 --> 02:19.639
Move!

02:20.405 --> 02:22.231
I'll dial!

02:34.683 --> 02:37.935
- Lock it up!
- Medical team!

02:43.685 --> 02:45.711
<i>What is that?</i>

02:45.764 --> 02:49.383
Those are bugs, sir. Big, ugly bugs!

02:59.963 --> 03:02.306
You're saying it's getting worse?

03:02.366 --> 03:04.405
I am.

03:08.245 --> 03:09.987
Agh...

03:10.045 --> 03:12.086
Easy...

03:13.085 --> 03:15.292
Looks like some kind of a reaction.

03:15.806 --> 03:19.003
Teal'c, shouldn't your
larval Goa'uld be helping?

03:19.085 --> 03:21.112
That is correct.

03:21.164 --> 03:23.204
But it is not.

03:24.605 --> 03:26.645
It is, in fact, getting worse.

04:37.768 --> 04:42.605
He's suffering from the side effects
of a viral infection - fever, aches, chills.

04:42.726 --> 04:45.100
- And his Goa'uld isn't helping?
- No.

04:45.968 --> 04:48.971
<i>- But that's not the worst part.
- What is?</i>

04:49.047 --> 04:50.997
The blood sample I took...

04:51.048 --> 04:54.480
...showed a disturbing amount of DNA
that doesn't match Teal'c's.

04:54.567 --> 04:56.608
<i>What does that mean?</i>

04:57.209 --> 04:59.588
Actually, I'm not sure.

04:59.648 --> 05:01.911
To be honest, I may be
out of my league here.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.841
General, if I may.

05:03.889 --> 05:07.204
At the Pentagon, I had the chance
to work with Dr. Timothy Harlow.

05:07.288 --> 05:10.995
He's one of the world's top geneticists
and has full security clearance.

05:11.088 --> 05:13.377
He'll be here before the end of the day.

05:19.848 --> 05:21.889
<i>Dr Harlow!</i>

05:22.889 --> 05:24.930
Sam! Well..!

05:26.249 --> 05:28.901
How many times have I told you
to call me Timothy?

05:28.970 --> 05:30.997
Timothy. You got here fast.

05:31.050 --> 05:33.973
For the chance to see this,
light speed isn't fast enough!

05:34.048 --> 05:36.115
It's not a bit disappointing either.

05:36.168 --> 05:39.446
- For a frontline setup.
- You haven't seen the best yet.

05:39.529 --> 05:41.908
I just wish it was under
better circumstances.

05:41.970 --> 05:44.348
Dr. Harlow has some bad news.

05:44.409 --> 05:47.178
Subsequent analysis
of the blood sample...

05:47.249 --> 05:51.346
<i>.. revealed none of
the subject's matching DNA.</i>

05:51.449 --> 05:53.595
Uh, the subject's name is Teal'c.

05:53.649 --> 05:55.677
And what are you talking about?

05:55.730 --> 05:59.317
The blood sample I took had only
a small percentage of alien insect DNA.

05:59.409 --> 06:00.869
Right.

06:00.930 --> 06:04.793
Now, when the exact same sample
of Teal'c's blood...

06:04.891 --> 06:07.620
...was tested only a few hours later,...

06:07.690 --> 06:10.108
...there was only one type
of DNA strand present.

06:10.170 --> 06:12.199
And it wasn't Teal'c's.

06:12.250 --> 06:14.552
Are you saying that the foreign DNA...

06:14.610 --> 06:18.237
...actually transformed Teal'c's DNA
in the blood sample?

06:18.331 --> 06:22.661
DNA doesn't alter DNA. There's probably
some sort of retrovirus present.

06:22.771 --> 06:24.978
OK, bottom line?

06:26.730 --> 06:29.071
I can't believe I'm going to say this.

06:29.130 --> 06:33.211
It appears...
that the alien insect's venom...

06:33.850 --> 06:36.463
...is rewriting Teal'c's genetic material.

06:36.531 --> 06:39.651
And it happened very quickly
in that blood sample.

06:39.731 --> 06:44.218
The Goa'uld Teal'c carries is supposed to
give him powerful immune capabilities.

06:44.331 --> 06:46.632
Yes, so I read on the plane. It's amazing.

06:46.691 --> 06:49.538
But in this case,
it's merely stemming the tide,...

06:49.610 --> 06:52.146
...rather than reversing the problem.

06:52.211 --> 06:54.750
What happens if the Goa'uld
loses the battle?

06:56.211 --> 06:58.981
Well, 30 years of research
into human DNA...

06:59.052 --> 07:03.466
<i>Until last year, I... didn't even
know there were aliens.</i>

07:04.492 --> 07:06.781
Right.

07:12.172 --> 07:14.247
I have felt great pain, O'Neill.

07:16.850 --> 07:18.891
But never sickness such as this.

07:22.413 --> 07:24.451
I do not enjoy it.

07:25.411 --> 07:27.156
Nobody does.

07:28.451 --> 07:32.581
I am also... feeling something else.

07:33.334 --> 07:35.360
Hey...

07:35.413 --> 07:37.737
I'd be scared, too.

07:38.932 --> 07:43.012
I do not want to become
something other than who I am.

07:43.932 --> 07:47.516
- Just let the doctors do their job.
- O'Neill.

07:49.213 --> 07:51.252
You are my friend.

07:53.572 --> 07:55.862
When there is no longer any hope,...

07:59.494 --> 08:01.533
...I would rather die.

08:05.413 --> 08:05.586
<i>Come in.</i>

08:05.613 --> 08:06.894
<i>Come in.</i>

08:07.934 --> 08:10.639
You wanted to see me, sir?

08:13.213 --> 08:15.254
Oh, for crying out loud!

08:16.053 --> 08:18.081
Colonel O'Neill.

08:18.134 --> 08:20.279
Hello, Maybourne.

08:20.334 --> 08:22.624
I thought you would want to see this.

08:31.973 --> 08:35.972
- You've got to be kidding.
- It's an official order. I have no choice.

08:38.014 --> 08:40.042
Well, uh... what about...

08:40.094 --> 08:42.706
The president is currently unavailable.

08:42.774 --> 08:47.259
This facility is frontline.
Your mandate is search and retrievaI.

08:47.374 --> 08:49.557
Mine is research and development.

08:49.614 --> 08:52.188
Teal'c has been invaluable
to your operation.

08:52.254 --> 08:55.091
Now he may prove
equally invaluable to mine.

08:55.894 --> 08:58.547
This organism could be
the biological weapon...

08:58.615 --> 09:01.892
He saved your smarmy ass
and everyone else on this planet.

09:01.975 --> 09:04.394
<i>Does that count for anything
in your world?</i>

09:04.456 --> 09:06.482
Absolutely.

09:06.534 --> 09:09.889
And I am thrilled to get the chance
to thank him personally.

09:09.975 --> 09:13.807
General Hammond, request permission
to beat the crap out of this man.

09:18.616 --> 09:20.408
You son of a bitch!

09:20.456 --> 09:22.081
Sam?

09:22.816 --> 09:26.755
It had to be you! Dammit, Timothy,
Teal'c is my friend. He's sick.

09:26.855 --> 09:31.538
Yes, he is, and he's going to get
the very best help available on this planet.

09:31.655 --> 09:35.947
But your facility is not equipped for
this kind of situation, and you know it.

09:36.056 --> 09:39.389
Don't tell me you're ignorant.
I don't wanna feel sorry for you.

09:40.216 --> 09:42.673
Maybourne's people
can be unscrupulous,...

09:42.735 --> 09:46.687
...but if Teal'c is to have
any chance, it is with me,...

09:47.616 --> 09:49.942
...and I will do the best that I can.

09:51.537 --> 09:55.125
<i>I have a right to stop this.</i>

09:55.216 --> 09:57.244
<i>He is not well enough to be moved.</i>

09:57.296 --> 09:58.625
Fortunately,...

09:58.697 --> 10:00.736
...I have a second opinion.

10:12.297 --> 10:14.323
How can we just let this happen?

10:14.375 --> 10:16.403
What do you want me to do?

10:16.456 --> 10:20.748
As much as I don't trust Maybourne,
I have to admit, Timothy is the best.

10:20.856 --> 10:23.857
And he gave me his word
he was gonna help Teal'c.

10:39.057 --> 10:41.086
What's with the chains?

10:41.138 --> 10:43.361
Maybourne.

10:43.418 --> 10:45.661
Of course.

10:52.698 --> 10:54.657
<i>Oh, God!</i>

11:03.259 --> 11:05.287
How long d'you figure he has?

11:05.339 --> 11:07.366
It's tough to say.

11:07.418 --> 11:10.187
Depends on how strong
the larval Goa'uld is.

11:10.258 --> 11:13.808
- We have drugs that may help.
- That won't be necessary.

11:13.899 --> 11:15.940
Of course it is, but...

11:17.899 --> 11:19.938
<i>You want him to change.</i>

11:44.140 --> 11:46.635
Notwithstanding
what happened to Teal'c,...

11:46.698 --> 11:49.546
...there may be invaluable technology
on that planet.

11:49.619 --> 11:53.911
Carter, there are bugs on that planet.
Big, huge, ugly, honkin' bugs!

11:54.019 --> 11:58.647
Colonel, we just picked up an emergency
communication from the driver.

13:18.022 --> 13:19.730
The driver's unconscious.

13:19.783 --> 13:21.657
<i>Jack.</i>

13:24.182 --> 13:25.807
It's alive.

13:33.344 --> 13:36.697
I want as many personnel
and canine units as this base has...

13:36.783 --> 13:38.811
...at my disposaI five minutes ago!

13:38.863 --> 13:42.764
All of whom report to me.
I'm running this search.

13:42.864 --> 13:44.892
This is still my responsibility.

13:44.943 --> 13:48.726
Oh, I'm holding you responsible,
Maybourne, don't you fret!

13:48.822 --> 13:51.240
But the troops are SGC.
I'm running the show.

13:51.302 --> 13:53.591
You got a problem with that,
see Hammond.

13:55.624 --> 13:57.663
I will.

14:00.063 --> 14:03.979
<i>Striking an officer
is a quick way to a court martiaI.</i>

14:05.504 --> 14:09.123
I'm not gonna hit you, Maybourne.
I'm gonna shoot you.

14:15.264 --> 14:19.437
<i>- All right, what the hell happened here?
- He just went crazy.</i>

14:19.543 --> 14:22.860
He was so strong.
I've never seen anything like that.

14:22.943 --> 14:24.605
And the larval Goa'uld?

14:24.664 --> 14:27.394
I don't know. He must have
taken that out himself.

14:27.463 --> 14:28.626
Why?

14:29.585 --> 14:30.700
Uh,...

14:30.783 --> 14:34.947
...he told me he'd rather die
than change into something else.

14:35.864 --> 14:39.181
There has to be quicker,
less painful ways to kill yourself.

14:39.265 --> 14:41.293
Even for a Jaffa.

14:41.346 --> 14:44.386
I don't think that's the way
it's going to happen.

14:44.463 --> 14:46.173
I doubt that he will die.

14:46.225 --> 14:48.977
He depends on that Goa'uld to live.

14:49.664 --> 14:53.956
The alien insect's venom
is affecting his physical make-up.

14:54.065 --> 14:58.864
<i>With every passing moment,
he is ceasing to be a... a Jaffa.</i>

14:58.985 --> 15:01.559
The larva may be the only thing...

15:01.625 --> 15:04.472
...that's holding that transformation back.

15:04.546 --> 15:09.006
So by taking the worm out,
he might be expediting this change?

15:10.945 --> 15:13.187
Why would he do that?

15:14.625 --> 15:18.457
The metamorphosis
could be altering his mind.

15:29.027 --> 15:31.951
- It's stable.
- I don't think it will be for long.

15:32.024 --> 15:34.717
I just wish I knew more
about Goa'uld physiology.

15:34.787 --> 15:36.971
The frustrating thing is, I might.

15:37.027 --> 15:40.264
Jolinar might have left me
with some information, but I...

15:40.346 --> 15:43.309
We've got samples of
the fluid from inside Teal'c's pouch.

15:43.385 --> 15:48.547
For now, we'll just have to do our best
to synthesise the environment.

15:56.868 --> 15:59.558
There's no sign of him
inside the perimeter.

15:59.626 --> 16:03.332
We don't have jurisdiction
if he's already gotten outside that.

16:03.427 --> 16:05.883
We got him!

16:09.106 --> 16:12.735
They were picking up a radio
in the field and patched him in here.

16:12.827 --> 16:14.868
<i>- Teal'c?
- O'Neill, it is I.</i>

16:15.668 --> 16:18.202
<i>Do not allow Colonel Maybourne
to follow me.</i>

16:18.268 --> 16:20.344
He's not going to. Where are you?

16:21.307 --> 16:23.335
I will not say.

16:23.386 --> 16:25.546
Come on, Teal'c. We can help you.

16:28.147 --> 16:30.174
It is too late.

16:30.226 --> 16:32.255
All right, listen.

16:32.307 --> 16:34.336
You're changing.

16:34.388 --> 16:38.136
You don't want this to happen -
you told me you'd rather die.

16:40.347 --> 16:41.926
Teal'c?

16:42.947 --> 16:44.692
<i>Teal'c?</i>

16:50.587 --> 16:54.684
<i>It is possible we can still
save your friend if we can get him back.</i>

16:54.789 --> 16:55.786
How?

16:55.868 --> 17:00.081
I have access to several variations
of experimental RNA inhibitors,...

17:00.188 --> 17:02.763
...which are being researched
at the moment.

17:02.828 --> 17:05.558
Combined with the healing abilities
of the symbiote...

17:05.627 --> 17:09.140
You knew this and didn't offer right away -
when it could have helped?!

17:09.230 --> 17:13.131
Maybourne was hoping Teal'c would
change, and you were gonna let him.

17:13.230 --> 17:16.154
No, I wasn't. Whatever you may think.

17:16.229 --> 17:18.518
Samantha, I am offering you my help.

17:21.108 --> 17:23.058
OK, what do you need?

17:23.108 --> 17:26.145
We have to find out
which of the drugs will work.

17:27.509 --> 17:28.755
How?

17:30.069 --> 17:32.228
We need the alien insect's venom.

17:36.670 --> 17:39.126
How do you know you can
trust Harlow this time?

17:39.190 --> 17:42.622
You think Maybourne put him up to this
to get a specimen of the insect.

17:42.709 --> 17:44.971
I wouldn't put it past him.

17:45.029 --> 17:46.653
We don't have a lot of options.

17:48.111 --> 17:50.919
- We got nothing.
- Must've covered 20 miles in an hour.

17:50.990 --> 17:54.736
- Maybourne is flying in his personnel.
- Any action on the red phone?

17:54.830 --> 17:56.241
Still indisposed.

17:56.310 --> 17:59.197
We have kind of a
good news/bad news scenario here.

17:59.269 --> 18:02.313
If we do find Teal'c soon,
we may have a way of saving him.

18:02.391 --> 18:03.968
OK. That's good news.

18:04.990 --> 18:09.789
But... someone has to go back to BP6-3Q1
and catch one of those alien insects.

18:09.911 --> 18:13.030
- Preferably alive.
- And that would be the bad news.

18:13.111 --> 18:15.567
- I'll go.
- You need someone to watch your back.

18:15.631 --> 18:17.698
And I'll go, too.

18:17.750 --> 18:20.247
It won't be for nothing. We'll find Teal'c.

18:20.310 --> 18:22.055
Pack your bug spray, kids.

18:34.592 --> 18:36.619
Check this dude out.

18:36.672 --> 18:38.711
Hey, man! Where you going?

18:39.593 --> 18:41.750
Cool tattoo, man. Where did you get that?

18:42.431 --> 18:44.092
Chulak.

18:44.152 --> 18:46.921
Chulak? Where's that? East Side?

18:46.991 --> 18:49.482
Remove yourself from my path.

18:50.872 --> 18:55.368
I'll remove myself when you tell me
how they do tattoos like that in Chulak.

18:57.632 --> 18:59.699
The skin is cut with an Orak knife...

18:59.751 --> 19:02.287
...and molten gold
is poured into the wound.

19:02.352 --> 19:04.096
Don't that hurt when they do that?

19:10.271 --> 19:12.311
Tremendously.

19:21.873 --> 19:23.902
That guy is cool!

19:23.953 --> 19:27.903
Ally, get outta here.
No one wants you around.

20:10.194 --> 20:12.221
Thank you.

20:12.273 --> 20:15.628
- Any word on the search?
- No. How's the Goa'uld doing?

20:15.714 --> 20:18.522
- Not well.
- Damned if I ever thought I'd be praying...

20:18.594 --> 20:20.550
...for one of those things to live.

20:21.034 --> 20:23.074
How long have they been gone?

20:24.953 --> 20:27.955
I'm about ready to send SG-3 after them.

21:27.557 --> 21:29.546
Incoming wormhole.

21:29.596 --> 21:31.092
It's SG-1.

21:42.477 --> 21:44.136
Lock it up!

21:50.037 --> 21:51.947
Close those doors!

21:54.517 --> 21:56.059
Where is it?

21:59.517 --> 22:00.928
Where is it?

22:00.998 --> 22:02.457
There!

22:17.959 --> 22:19.998
Just winged it.

22:24.199 --> 22:26.239
All right, all right! You got it!

22:35.397 --> 22:37.503
Not your garden-variety mosquito.

22:37.557 --> 22:40.211
There's no word on Teal'c yet,
but Maybourne...

22:40.278 --> 22:43.242
...put out a bulletin
to the state and local police.

22:43.318 --> 22:45.541
We gotta find him first, sir.

22:45.598 --> 22:47.979
Maybourne has the
manpower advantage.

22:48.039 --> 22:50.246
You really should see this, sir.

22:57.239 --> 22:59.930
We heard noises coming from
one of the buildings.

22:59.999 --> 23:03.582
The final stage of the metamorphosis
requires a dark place.

23:06.719 --> 23:09.333
<i>- That's a man!
- The inhabitants were human.</i>

23:09.400 --> 23:12.403
- Possibly from Earth.
- Daniel was right.

23:12.480 --> 23:16.342
But their entire civilisation
was obviously wiped out by this bug.

23:16.440 --> 23:18.662
All those inhabitants were changed.

23:18.719 --> 23:21.762
It's amazing.
With all our technology, maybe more,...

23:21.840 --> 23:25.546
...they couldn't prevent their demise
at the hands of a simple insect.

23:25.640 --> 23:29.720
Yeah, real simple! Take a look at this, sir.

23:36.640 --> 23:39.261
All those things came from one body?!

23:40.881 --> 23:42.909
Of course...

23:42.961 --> 23:45.333
Equal-matter conversion.

23:46.240 --> 23:48.385
It's how they reproduce.

23:48.441 --> 23:52.926
The insect's venom actually converts the
body's mass into its own DNA material.

23:53.040 --> 23:55.498
But a human's - or a Jaffa's - total matter...

23:55.560 --> 23:58.564
...is far greater than one of
the insects' natural mass.

23:58.641 --> 24:00.134
Thank you.

24:00.201 --> 24:03.478
<i>So Teal'c isn't going to
turn into just one of those things?</i>

24:03.560 --> 24:08.354
No, sir. He's going to turn into
a whole lot of those things.

24:17.801 --> 24:20.554
<i>Nobody move!</i>

24:22.641 --> 24:25.558
Sorry. Didn't know
the room was occupied.

24:27.121 --> 24:29.305
What type of weapon do you possess?

24:29.361 --> 24:33.808
This? Chill, dude, it's just a water gun.
I was just playing, see?

24:33.922 --> 24:34.787
Urgh...

24:38.280 --> 24:40.606
Sorry, man. Please don't freak on me.

24:42.442 --> 24:44.184
Leave me.

24:46.561 --> 24:49.267
You're not from around here, are you?

24:56.682 --> 24:59.295
Whoa! Man!

24:59.362 --> 25:01.624
If you ask me,...

25:01.682 --> 25:04.256
...you could use
a couple more days in rehab.

25:05.762 --> 25:08.432
No one must know that I am here.

25:09.803 --> 25:12.143
OK. Are you sure, though?

25:12.202 --> 25:17.234
I mean, you look worse than my dad did
after he got shot. And he died.

25:17.363 --> 25:19.521
You must leave.

25:21.962 --> 25:22.959
OK.

25:25.083 --> 25:27.241
- Wait!
- What?

25:32.684 --> 25:34.642
I must have nourishment.

25:36.124 --> 25:39.576
Oh, man! You want my chocolate bar?

25:40.723 --> 25:42.516
I must eat.

25:48.763 --> 25:50.802
OK. How about we share it?

26:12.565 --> 26:15.104
Peanuts and caramel. Pretty good, huh?

26:16.483 --> 26:18.310
Can you get more?

26:18.924 --> 26:20.585
Maybe.

26:20.644 --> 26:22.435
What's in it for me?

26:23.724 --> 26:25.909
Peanuts and caramel.

26:25.964 --> 26:27.992
No, dumb-ass. I mean...

26:28.045 --> 26:29.752
What do I get?

26:29.805 --> 26:32.260
I have nothing to offer you.

26:33.964 --> 26:36.800
How about... Let's say you owe me one.

26:37.724 --> 26:39.752
<i>Like in The Godfather.</i>

26:39.805 --> 26:41.512
How's that?

26:44.365 --> 26:47.780
- OK, back in a flash.
- No one must know.

26:49.846 --> 26:52.884
- Don't sweat it.
- I cannot prevent it.

26:54.925 --> 26:56.549
I meant, OK.

27:01.164 --> 27:04.165
Will you retract that flap for me, please?

27:05.965 --> 27:09.798
- Me?
- It's perfectly sedated.

27:13.646 --> 27:16.565
It's very tough armour our little friend has.

27:21.166 --> 27:23.207
Quite a creation, all right.

27:33.006 --> 27:35.046
There's the juice.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.633
I worked out a probability model.

27:38.688 --> 27:42.743
Absolute worst-case scenario, if the
mutation in Teal'c runs the full course.

27:42.846 --> 27:46.124
- How bad?
- The insect can multiply exponentially.

27:46.207 --> 27:49.913
So, every person who's stung
could turn into about ten bugs.

27:50.008 --> 27:53.205
Now, we don't have an exact time
on the incubation, but...

27:53.287 --> 27:55.030
We're guessing on the safe side.

27:55.087 --> 27:59.133
We could have swarms in the order
of millions in six to eight weeks.

28:29.688 --> 28:31.728
Hey.

28:39.209 --> 28:41.249
Are you a Kimble?

28:42.888 --> 28:44.929
What is a Kimble?

28:46.888 --> 28:51.491
<i>What planet are you from? You know,
Dr. Richard Kimble - The Fugitive.</i>

28:51.608 --> 28:53.989
I'm asking if you're wanted by the law.

28:54.049 --> 28:57.384
Looks like the cops
are asking about you on the street.

28:58.848 --> 29:00.877
They must not find me.

29:00.930 --> 29:02.589
What did you do?

29:05.048 --> 29:08.002
I have done nothing.

29:09.049 --> 29:11.089
Innocent until proven guilty!

29:16.329 --> 29:18.405
You must leave.

29:19.411 --> 29:20.989
Why?

29:21.049 --> 29:22.710
I am...

29:22.769 --> 29:24.347
...dangerous.

29:24.410 --> 29:26.901
No way. You won't hurt me.

29:29.329 --> 29:31.121
How can you know this?

29:32.131 --> 29:34.586
I got the sense. My old man gave it to me.

29:35.369 --> 29:39.414
He was a cop. He could tell who the
bad guys were just by smelling 'em.

29:40.810 --> 29:42.851
What is your purpose here?

29:43.730 --> 29:45.769
Got nothing better to do.

29:47.491 --> 29:50.221
Do you not attend
an educationaI institution?

29:50.290 --> 29:52.318
What planet are you from?!

29:52.371 --> 29:54.398
Duh!

29:54.451 --> 29:58.311
Nobody goes to school in the summer.
Unless you're stupid.

29:58.411 --> 30:00.945
What of the one who gave you birth?

30:01.009 --> 30:03.038
My mom?

30:03.089 --> 30:06.625
She works all day so I can
get dinner and a place to sleep.

30:09.092 --> 30:11.393
Listen, you're a sitting duck down here.

30:11.451 --> 30:13.859
And ducks are bad?

30:15.451 --> 30:18.203
Uh... the sitting kind are.

30:21.412 --> 30:24.163
If you can get up, I can
show you a place to hide.

30:30.531 --> 30:32.559
I understand. We will.

30:32.612 --> 30:35.265
The president has overruled
Maybourne's orders.

30:35.332 --> 30:38.101
So if local authorities find Teal'c,
we get him back.

30:38.172 --> 30:42.419
Yes. But Maybourne still has
jurisdiction to continue his search.

30:43.532 --> 30:45.157
Great.

30:45.211 --> 30:47.251
So the race is on.

30:47.731 --> 30:50.502
Shouldn't you really see a doctor?

30:50.573 --> 30:52.601
I must rest.

30:52.653 --> 30:55.968
No, it's just up...
it's just a bit more up there.

30:56.052 --> 30:58.093
Almost...

31:06.212 --> 31:08.252
All right, move it out! Let's go.

31:23.933 --> 31:25.972
We're through!

31:28.893 --> 31:31.384
It's up here. It's not a long way.

31:55.334 --> 31:57.243
I think we've got it.

31:57.294 --> 32:00.531
This drug is slowing the
transformation in the sample.

32:00.615 --> 32:03.034
Now, it wouldn't cure a normal human,...

32:03.095 --> 32:07.541
...but Teal'c may stand a chance with the
help of his symbiote's healing abilities.

32:07.654 --> 32:09.814
We may not have that for much longer.

32:13.214 --> 32:14.839
<i>What?</i>

32:14.894 --> 32:16.934
It's dying.

32:18.335 --> 32:20.374
What can we do?

33:39.656 --> 33:41.697
This is all we found.

33:41.936 --> 33:44.082
Hello, young lady.

33:44.136 --> 33:48.272
I'm Colonel Maybourne. I work for the
United States of America. The good guys.

33:48.377 --> 33:50.204
Yeah, right!

33:51.698 --> 33:54.349
We're here on a little investigation.

33:54.416 --> 33:56.835
Actually, we're looking for someone.

33:56.896 --> 33:59.315
He was last seen around this building.

33:59.376 --> 34:01.404
We think he could still be here.

34:01.457 --> 34:03.953
Maybe you could help us. Now, he's tall...

34:04.018 --> 34:07.920
I ain't seen nobody, and even
if I did, I wouldn't tell you.

34:08.018 --> 34:09.726
Why's that?

34:09.777 --> 34:12.565
Because I don't like the way you smell.

34:18.219 --> 34:21.338
Colonel,... from the looks of it,
we only have minutes.

34:23.338 --> 34:26.068
Captain, is there anything
your Tok'ra memories...

34:26.139 --> 34:30.782
I know, sir. I know. I can't just access
them at will. Believe me, I've been trying.

34:30.898 --> 34:34.800
<i>It's too bad you can't zap it
with those paddles like they do on ER.</i>

34:34.900 --> 34:37.143
That guy that's, um...

34:38.018 --> 34:39.512
What?

34:39.579 --> 34:42.777
- It couldn't be that simple.
- Defibbing would kill it.

34:42.858 --> 34:46.565
But we've done our best to synthesise
the environmental conditions...

34:46.659 --> 34:49.195
...the Goa'uld larval has
inside Teal'c's pouch.

34:49.260 --> 34:52.184
- Nutrition, temperature...
- Except electrical current!

34:52.259 --> 34:57.056
And there is a small electrical charge in
all our bodies. The Goa'uld may need that.

34:57.179 --> 34:59.635
So all we need is
a small enough power source.

35:01.659 --> 35:02.989
What?

35:16.780 --> 35:18.820
They're gone.

35:25.139 --> 35:27.179
Oh, my God!

35:32.061 --> 35:34.101
What happened to you?

35:45.900 --> 35:47.643
This is, like,...

35:48.701 --> 35:51.072
...serious alien stuff going on here.

35:56.021 --> 35:58.144
If you don't tell me what to do,...

35:58.782 --> 36:00.822
<i>.. I am gonna get the cops.</i>

36:01.822 --> 36:03.731
Oh,... God...

36:03.782 --> 36:07.282
My dad used to know
a couple of guys we can trust.

36:09.661 --> 36:11.452
No...

36:11.501 --> 36:13.530
Well, look at you.

36:13.581 --> 36:16.998
You don't really want
this to happen, do you?

36:27.222 --> 36:29.251
<i>It's getting better.</i>

36:29.302 --> 36:31.342
It was so simple.

36:32.702 --> 36:34.826
Well, I guess my work here is done.

36:41.541 --> 36:42.786
Fraiser.

36:42.862 --> 36:44.108
Yeah. Colonel.

36:48.103 --> 36:50.391
Hello. Is this Colonel Jack O'Neill?

36:51.023 --> 36:55.041
It's about time! I only had to talk
to about 15 people to get to you!

36:55.143 --> 36:57.351
Do you know a big dude named Teal'c?

36:58.862 --> 37:01.188
Yeah, man. I would hurry if I was you.

37:15.264 --> 37:17.304
Oh, my God!

37:20.623 --> 37:22.284
Teal'c.

37:27.262 --> 37:29.302
I'll go get help.

37:32.784 --> 37:34.824
Teal'c.

37:35.623 --> 37:37.885
<i>O'Neill?</i>

37:37.943 --> 37:40.067
Yeah. It's me.

37:40.704 --> 37:42.661
Kill me.

37:43.664 --> 37:45.871
Uh... no.

37:47.385 --> 37:49.543
The change cannot be stopped.

37:50.143 --> 37:52.445
I won't lie to you -

37:52.503 --> 37:54.543
...you don't look so great...

37:55.144 --> 37:57.268
But you're gonna make it.

37:58.304 --> 38:00.344
You're gonna be OK.

38:15.503 --> 38:18.585
- Why can't I go with you?
- I'm sorry, you just can't.

38:18.664 --> 38:21.036
These guys here
are gonna take care of you.

38:24.304 --> 38:27.853
- Is Teal'c gonna be OK?
- I hope so.

38:27.945 --> 38:29.653
Me, too.

38:31.666 --> 38:34.123
Hey!

38:34.186 --> 38:36.344
Tell him he still owes me one.

38:50.465 --> 38:54.483
His pouch had started to close,
but we were able to reopen it.

38:54.585 --> 38:57.940
The Goa'uld is back where it belongs,
and it seems to be doing OK.

38:58.025 --> 38:59.485
And Teal'c?

38:59.547 --> 39:01.574
With the help of the drug,...

39:01.626 --> 39:05.371
...it appears the symbiote
has stopped the metamorphosis.

39:05.467 --> 39:09.132
We're hoping the Goa'uld is able
to reverse the damage already done.

39:09.226 --> 39:10.768
It can't be easy,...

39:10.827 --> 39:12.856
...knowing the Goa'uld saved your life.

39:12.907 --> 39:14.652
<i>Even I'm happy he's got the snake.</i>

39:14.706 --> 39:16.367
This sounds like good news.

39:17.387 --> 39:18.847
Hope so.

39:19.867 --> 39:23.572
Maybourne has ordered the insect
specimen and related research...

39:23.666 --> 39:26.710
...transferred to the Area 51 facility.

39:26.788 --> 39:30.414
- I should have shot him.
- I regret that's impossible, sir.

39:30.507 --> 39:32.456
Why is that?

39:32.507 --> 39:35.277
As soon as Teal'c is fully recovered,...

39:35.347 --> 39:39.724
...the insect is going to be involved
in an unfortunate lab accident.

39:40.509 --> 39:43.711
I'm afraid I'll have to
take full responsibility.

40:11.228 --> 40:13.257
Teal'c!

40:13.309 --> 40:15.101
Hi!

40:15.148 --> 40:18.233
- Greetings, Ally.
- You're OK!

40:19.068 --> 40:21.253
Thanks to you, I am feeling much better.

40:21.309 --> 40:23.844
<i>Ah, man, it was no sweat.
You look way better.</i>

40:23.909 --> 40:26.835
I guess you can't really
tell me what happened -

40:26.909 --> 40:29.952
...all that top-secret
James Bond stuff, right?

40:30.030 --> 40:31.653
That is correct.

40:31.708 --> 40:35.063
But to show my gratitude,
I have brought you a new weapon.

40:35.148 --> 40:38.565
One with increased range and fire power.

40:39.469 --> 40:41.509
Wicked! This is so cool!

40:42.989 --> 40:45.018
Have any time to play?

40:45.070 --> 40:46.268
Actually, we...

40:52.309 --> 40:54.800
Guess we shouldn't have loaded it, huh?

40:58.231 --> 41:00.438
How else would she defend herself?

41:05.750 --> 41:07.789
How else?
