WEBVTT

00:02.293 --> 00:04.920
Chandler! Chandler!

00:08.508 --> 00:10.884
I saw what you were doing
through the window.

00:11.136 --> 00:14.179
I saw what you were doing to my sister,
now, get out here!

00:14.806 --> 00:17.683
Well, listen, we had a good run.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.768
You know? What was it?
Four, five months?

00:19.936 --> 00:22.104
I mean, that's more than most people
have in a lifetime.

00:22.272 --> 00:24.648
So goodbye, take care, bye-bye then.

00:25.775 --> 00:28.527
- What are you doing?
- Oh, I'm going on the lam.

00:28.903 --> 00:31.655
Come on, Chandler. Come on.
I can handle Ross.

00:32.281 --> 00:33.741
Hold on.

00:36.828 --> 00:38.454
Hey, Ross. What's up, bro?

00:40.832 --> 00:44.668
What the hell are you doing?

00:44.878 --> 00:45.919
Hey, what's going on?

00:46.171 --> 00:50.174
Well, I think... I think Ross knows
about me and Monica.

00:51.342 --> 00:53.927
Dude, he's right there.

00:56.097 --> 00:59.224
I thought you were my best friend.
This is my sister.

00:59.476 --> 01:02.478
My best friend and my sister.
I cannot believe this.

01:02.729 --> 01:06.482
We're not just messing around.
I love her.

01:06.858 --> 01:08.442
Okay? I'm in love with her.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.529
I'm so sorry that you
had to find out this way.

01:13.531 --> 01:16.784
I'm sorry, but it's true. I love him too.

01:23.166 --> 01:25.709
My best friend and my sister.

01:28.838 --> 01:31.006
I cannot believe this.

01:33.259 --> 01:36.762
You guys want to probably get
some hugs in too, huh? Big news.

01:36.971 --> 01:40.265
Oh, no, that's okay.
We've actually known for a while.

01:44.729 --> 01:46.939
What? What? You guys knew?

01:47.774 --> 01:49.775
You all knew and
you didn't tell me?

01:50.110 --> 01:52.653
Well, Ross, we were worried
about you, okay?

01:52.821 --> 01:54.488
We didn't know how you were
going to react.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.156
Mm-mm.

01:58.201 --> 02:01.120
You were worried about me?

02:01.746 --> 02:03.705
You didn't know how I was gonna react?

02:06.835 --> 02:09.169
Okay. All right. Whew.

02:09.336 --> 02:11.171
What do you say we all, uh,
clear out of here...

02:11.339 --> 02:14.216
...and let these two love birds
get back down to business.

02:16.761 --> 02:20.430
Hey, hey, hey. I'm just talking here.
He's the one doing your sister.

03:03.474 --> 03:05.142
Hey, you know what I just realized?

03:05.393 --> 03:08.228
- If you guys ever have kids...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're having kids?

03:08.479 --> 03:09.730
I call godfather.

03:11.608 --> 03:14.651
You can't just call godfather.

03:15.361 --> 03:17.779
Don't you think her brother
should be godfather?

03:17.989 --> 03:20.407
Sure. If you cared enough to call it first.

03:21.034 --> 03:26.330
- Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.
- Yeah, big zero-gravity moon steps.

03:26.789 --> 03:29.666
Oh, oh, I just thought of
the greatest wedding gift to get you.

03:29.876 --> 03:32.544
Oh, I'll go in on that with you.
I couldn't think of anything.

03:35.173 --> 03:36.465
Hey, Katie.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.050
- Hey, everyone, this is Katie.
- Hi.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.593
- Hi.
- You ready to go?

03:39.844 --> 03:41.678
- Yeah, just gotta run to the bathroom.
- Sure.

03:41.846 --> 03:44.973
- Hey, where are we going to lunch?
- I was thinking maybe Chinese food.

03:45.141 --> 03:46.600
I love Chinese.

03:46.851 --> 03:49.478
How did you know I love Chinese?

03:53.191 --> 03:54.608
She is so cute.

03:54.859 --> 03:56.860
You could fit her
right in your little pocket.

03:58.446 --> 04:02.407
I don't know. I mean, I like her a lot,
and she's really nice, but...

04:02.659 --> 04:04.201
But what?

04:05.912 --> 04:07.829
She keeps punching me.

04:09.958 --> 04:12.709
In the cute little, sweet way she just did?

04:12.961 --> 04:15.545
Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks, okay?

04:16.673 --> 04:19.091
She's hurting me.

04:19.591 --> 04:22.302
I know what you need.
You need a bodyguard.

04:22.553 --> 04:24.513
Hey, Ross, what is Ben doing
after preschool?

04:26.766 --> 04:31.019
Okay, come on, Joey is having a problem.
There's a little girl who's beating him up.

04:31.437 --> 04:33.939
Aw, Joey, come here. Look.

04:34.190 --> 04:37.567
Honey, I know. This must be
really, really difficult for you, and...

04:37.819 --> 04:39.486
Oh, I'm sorry, am I hurting you?

04:49.956 --> 04:50.998
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:51.207 --> 04:53.333
- I brought you some housewarming gifts.
- Oh.

04:53.501 --> 04:56.545
- Salt, so your life always has flavor.
- Ah.

04:56.713 --> 04:59.464
- Bread, so you never go hungry.
- Oh.

04:59.632 --> 05:02.509
And a scented candle for the bathroom.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.344
Because, well, you know.

05:05.596 --> 05:09.766
Well, thanks. Thanks.
And thanks, I guess.

05:11.227 --> 05:15.522
Hi. Welcome to the building. I'm Steve Cera,
President of the tenants' committee.

05:15.773 --> 05:18.608
Oh, hi. Ross Geller.
And, uh, this is my friend Phoebe.

05:18.901 --> 05:21.403
- Hi, Phoebe.
- Mr. President.

05:22.780 --> 05:24.906
I, uh, came to talk to you about Howard.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.199
Howard?

05:26.367 --> 05:28.827
Yeah, he's the handyman.
He's gonna be retiring next week...

05:28.995 --> 05:31.455
...and everyone who lives here is kicking in
a hundred bucks...

05:31.622 --> 05:33.999
...as a "thank you for all the hard work"
type of thing.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.625
- Oh, that's nice.
- Yeah.

05:35.793 --> 05:37.294
So you want to give me a check, or?

05:40.340 --> 05:41.381
Oh, uh...

05:41.549 --> 05:44.176
You don't have to give it to me now.
You can slip it under my door.

05:44.344 --> 05:48.972
No, no, it's not that. It's just...
I just moved in.

05:49.974 --> 05:53.060
Well, the guy's worked here
for 25 years.

05:53.311 --> 05:55.854
Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.

05:57.732 --> 05:59.358
Oh.

05:59.776 --> 06:01.777
Okay, I get it.

06:02.153 --> 06:06.823
Wait. Look, I'm sorry, it's just
I've never even met Howard.

06:07.075 --> 06:09.409
I mean, I don't know Howard.

06:09.660 --> 06:12.329
Howard's the handyman.

06:13.414 --> 06:17.250
Yes, but to me he's just "man."

06:17.919 --> 06:20.879
Okay. Fine. Whatever.

06:21.172 --> 06:23.590
Welcome to the building.

06:26.177 --> 06:28.178
Can you believe that guy?

06:28.346 --> 06:30.889
Yeah. I really like his glasses.

06:36.396 --> 06:39.689
So then President Steve
told everyone I was a cheapskate...

06:39.941 --> 06:41.942
...and now the whole building hates me.

06:42.151 --> 06:44.653
A little kid spit on my knee.

06:45.905 --> 06:50.242
You know what? I'm gonna throw a party.
That's right, for everyone in the building.

06:50.451 --> 06:54.413
And I'm gonna sit them all down and
explain to them that I am not a bad guy.

06:54.580 --> 06:57.165
I am not a cheap guy. I'm just a guy...

06:57.333 --> 06:59.960
...who stands up for what he believes in.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.671
A man with principles.

07:03.172 --> 07:04.881
- Sounds like a fun party.
- Mm.

07:07.009 --> 07:09.136
Look, Ross, if you want
your neighbors to like you...

07:09.303 --> 07:11.012
...why don't you just pay
the hundred bucks?

07:11.180 --> 07:14.599
- A party's gonna cost you way more.
- That doesn't matter.

07:14.767 --> 07:18.145
It's my principles.
We're talking about my principles.

07:18.604 --> 07:21.773
Okay, I thought it was about
your neighbors liking you.

07:22.024 --> 07:25.861
Oh, they'll like me once they come
to my awesome par-tay.

07:27.822 --> 07:30.574
Okay, I gotta run.
I gotta go get some nametags.

07:33.453 --> 07:36.913
And that crazy party animal
will be your brother-in-law.

07:38.541 --> 07:41.168
Very, very funny. But don't say things
like that in from of Monica.

07:41.335 --> 07:43.462
I don't want you putting any ideas
in her head.

07:43.629 --> 07:46.131
Um, Chandler, you do realize
that those ideas...

07:46.299 --> 07:48.425
...are probably already in Monica's head?

07:49.093 --> 07:50.552
Why?

07:51.888 --> 07:55.724
Well, because she loves you
and because you love her.

07:56.017 --> 07:58.310
Yeah, so? What's
that supposed to mean?

07:59.312 --> 08:03.106
Hey, Chandler, don't freak out. I'm
telling you something you already know.

08:03.316 --> 08:06.443
Come on. She broke up with Richard
because he didn't want to have babies.

08:06.652 --> 08:11.490
And she's a woman, and she's almost 30,
and, you know, it's Monica.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.409
I don't see it that way. Okay?
I see two Monicas:

08:14.660 --> 08:18.288
The one that was my friend who lives
across the hall and wanted a lot of babies.

08:19.248 --> 08:24.753
And the new Monica who I started to date.
Now, who is to say what she wants?

08:25.588 --> 08:29.299
I'm right. I'm right. Am I right?

08:31.552 --> 08:32.760
Yeah, you're right.

08:32.929 --> 08:35.764
You are absolutely right.
I mean, that makes everything different.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.515
Okay.

08:37.975 --> 08:39.308
It's not different, is it?

08:39.559 --> 08:41.727
Not unless "different" means the same.

08:43.813 --> 08:47.901
You were so funny with that waiter.
You're such a nut.

08:53.783 --> 08:56.743
You know, breadstick fangs
are always funny.

08:56.994 --> 09:00.080
No, you make them funny.
You're the funny one.

09:02.625 --> 09:06.044
Uh, look, Katie, uh, listen,
we need to talk, okay?

09:06.212 --> 09:11.383
Um, look, I like you.
I really do. I like you a lot, okay?

09:11.551 --> 09:15.011
But sometimes when you
playfully punch me like that...

09:15.263 --> 09:20.392
...it feels like someone's hitting me
with a very tiny, but a very real bat.

09:22.353 --> 09:25.105
Oh. Like I could hurt you.

09:25.314 --> 09:28.024
- Are you making fun of my size?
- No.

09:28.192 --> 09:31.361
Don't make fun of me because of my size.

09:36.784 --> 09:39.202
- Isn't this great?
- Mm.

09:39.370 --> 09:41.913
Couldn't you just stay like this forever?

09:45.001 --> 09:46.376
Chandler?

09:46.752 --> 09:48.753
Couldn't you just stay here forever?

09:48.963 --> 09:52.757
Yeah, here, somewhere else.
You know, wherever. Ha, ha.

09:54.093 --> 09:56.678
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm cool.

09:56.929 --> 09:58.346
Casual.

09:59.307 --> 10:00.599
What are you doing?

10:00.975 --> 10:05.353
Just hanging out. Having fun, you know,
uh, with the girl that I'm seeing casually.

10:07.106 --> 10:09.774
Man, I knew it.
I knew you were going to do this.

10:09.942 --> 10:11.151
What?

10:11.319 --> 10:14.613
Get all freaked out because everybody
was joking around about marriage.

10:15.239 --> 10:18.283
Well, you do want all that stuff, right?

10:18.534 --> 10:19.951
And you know what I want?

10:20.202 --> 10:23.121
Yes. You want babies.
You have baby fever.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.333
I do not have baby fever.

10:26.584 --> 10:29.461
Oh, please. You are obsessed
with babies and marriage...

10:29.712 --> 10:33.840
...and everything that's
related to babies and marriage.

10:34.008 --> 10:38.094
You know what? Why don't we turn
the heat down on this pressure cooker?

10:39.513 --> 10:41.348
Have you lost your mind?

10:41.599 --> 10:42.766
Chandler, this isn't about me.

10:42.933 --> 10:45.810
This is about you and all your weird
relationship commitment crap.

10:46.062 --> 10:50.523
Uh-uh. I know you, okay? I know the
thoughts that you have in your head.

10:51.442 --> 10:52.859
Well, you don't know everything.

10:53.110 --> 10:56.613
Did you know I'm going out with Rachel
tonight instead of you? Hmm?

10:56.781 --> 10:58.907
And that the only baby around here
is you?

10:59.116 --> 11:02.202
And did you know I can't even
look at you right now?

11:04.538 --> 11:05.914
Yeah, well, I did not know that.

11:10.544 --> 11:14.589
It's gonna be okay, right? I mean,
she's not gonna leave me. This is fixable.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.841
- Yeah, sure.
- Absolutely.

11:17.051 --> 11:19.386
- By me?
- Oh, no, no, no.

11:21.222 --> 11:24.391
Well, unless you make
some kind of big gesture.

11:24.558 --> 11:25.600
Yeah, big, though.

11:27.353 --> 11:28.395
Shh. The missus.

11:30.398 --> 11:32.607
Gunther, can I get a coffee?

11:33.693 --> 11:34.734
To go.

11:35.569 --> 11:36.611
Monica...

11:36.779 --> 11:38.571
I'm still not done
not wanting to talk to you.

11:38.823 --> 11:41.074
Just tell me what I need to do
to make things right.

11:41.283 --> 11:43.076
- What?
- That's what we do.

11:43.327 --> 11:46.413
I mess up, you tell me
how to fix it and I do.

11:46.664 --> 11:49.082
And then, you know,
you think I'm all cute again.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.712
I'm really tired of being
your relationship tutor.

11:53.921 --> 11:55.880
You're gonna have to
figure this out for yourself.

11:57.091 --> 11:59.718
You know what? If you're too afraid
to be in a real relationship...

11:59.885 --> 12:01.803
...then don't be in one.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.109
Right about now
Funk soul brother

12:16.277 --> 12:19.279
Check it out now
Funk soul brother

12:19.447 --> 12:38.423
Right about now
Funk soul brother

12:39.800 --> 12:44.554
Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard!

12:52.229 --> 12:53.980
Phoebe. Phoebe.

12:55.024 --> 12:56.316
Oh, hi, Ross.

12:58.110 --> 12:59.611
What are you doing here?

12:59.862 --> 13:03.531
Oh, I thought this was your party,
and it turns out it's a party for Howard.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.742
He's the sweetest little man.

13:06.869 --> 13:09.829
See you, Phoebe.
Oh, and, hey, thanks for chipping in.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.456
Oh, sure.

13:12.374 --> 13:13.875
You chipped in?

13:14.126 --> 13:15.627
Yeah, uh-huh, hundred dollars.

13:16.253 --> 13:18.755
Phoebe, I can't believe
you gave him money.

13:18.964 --> 13:23.218
I thought you agreed it was unreasonable
that they asked me for that money.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.094
Yeah, but they didn't ask me, you know?

13:25.262 --> 13:27.722
This way I'm just, you know,
the exotic, generous stranger.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.599
That's always fun to be.

13:30.309 --> 13:32.435
Yeah, but you're making me look bad.

13:32.686 --> 13:35.772
No, I'm not. No, if anything,
I'm making you look better.

13:36.023 --> 13:39.400
They'll see you talking to me,
and I'm a hit.

13:40.194 --> 13:42.111
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

13:42.363 --> 13:43.863
Oh, hey, Ross.

13:44.031 --> 13:46.491
Um, say, I was thinking
maybe you two could switch apartments.

13:46.700 --> 13:49.369
Because Phoebe is more
our kind of people.

13:49.578 --> 13:50.829
Something to think about it.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.292
Yeah, okay, my bad.

14:06.595 --> 14:08.304
- Hey.
- Hi.

14:11.600 --> 14:14.644
Wow. You look big.

14:15.437 --> 14:17.355
Thanks, I've been working out.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.900
Hey, listen, is it obvious
I'm wearing six sweaters?

14:21.068 --> 14:22.986
Uh, yeah.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.905
But it's not obvious why.

14:26.407 --> 14:29.784
Well, look, I'm breaking up with Katie,
so I had to put on some extra padding.

14:30.035 --> 14:32.161
You know, I mean,
if she hits me when she's happy...

14:32.329 --> 14:34.247
...can you imagine how hard
she's gonna hit me...

14:34.415 --> 14:36.958
...when I tell her I'm taking away
the Joey love?

14:39.628 --> 14:40.670
Hey.

14:42.631 --> 14:44.299
Hey. Hey, cute jacket.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.092
Oh, thanks.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.469
- That's so sweet.
- Whoa. Ow.

14:50.973 --> 14:52.181
Oh, "Ow."

14:52.474 --> 14:55.393
Did Joey tell you to say that?
You guys are too much.

14:55.561 --> 14:58.521
Whoa. Ha, ha.

14:58.689 --> 15:01.190
You know what? I gotta tell you...

15:01.358 --> 15:03.484
...I think you're the one that is too much.

15:06.322 --> 15:08.656
Joey has the nicest friends.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.910
And the nicest girlfriend.

15:13.871 --> 15:15.330
You're so sweet.

15:16.457 --> 15:19.042
- You're so sweet.
- Ow!

15:24.298 --> 15:25.590
Joey?

15:25.966 --> 15:27.842
She just kicked me.

15:28.093 --> 15:29.677
Huh.

15:32.723 --> 15:35.224
Well, aren't you gonna do something?

15:35.559 --> 15:36.601
Uh...

15:36.769 --> 15:39.520
You better do something or I'm gonna
walk out that door right now.

15:40.439 --> 15:43.483
Well, are you gonna?

15:44.860 --> 15:46.319
Nah.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.502
- Phoebe?
- Ha, ha. That's what I was saying.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.629
Phoebe? Phoebe?

16:05.589 --> 16:08.841
This is a disaster.
Can't I please just go?

16:09.093 --> 16:10.843
I'm talking you up to people.

16:11.053 --> 16:13.721
Just give it a little time, all right? Relax.
Get something to eat.

16:17.184 --> 16:20.311
So, uh, what did you tell them about me?

16:20.479 --> 16:24.065
Um, I told them about you and Emily.
You know, trying to get some sympathy.

16:24.316 --> 16:26.401
But somehow you came off
as the bad guy.

16:27.027 --> 16:29.737
- What?
- Yeah, I think I told it wrong.

16:31.281 --> 16:32.448
We should talk about that...

16:32.616 --> 16:35.618
...because I don't totally understand
what happened there.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.706
Oh. This cake is really good.

16:40.499 --> 16:42.083
Okay, see?
Things are looking up already.

16:42.251 --> 16:46.462
Oh, my God.
Someone cut Howard's cake.

16:50.134 --> 16:52.719
Who would do a thing like that?

16:58.600 --> 16:59.767
3-B.

17:02.229 --> 17:05.022
Okay, you got your free food,
you ruined everyone's fun.

17:05.273 --> 17:08.608
- Don't you think it's time you went home?
- Yeah.

17:08.777 --> 17:11.820
Yeah, go back to 3-B, 3-B.

17:11.989 --> 17:14.656
All right, everyone, calm down.
Everyone, calm down.

17:14.825 --> 17:16.784
I have something that I would like to say.

17:19.579 --> 17:21.204
Who here likes Ross?

17:26.420 --> 17:27.962
Of course you don't like him.

17:28.213 --> 17:29.964
He didn't give you any money.

17:30.299 --> 17:33.843
He raised his own hand when I asked,
"Who here likes Ross?"

17:34.011 --> 17:35.970
And he's wearing two nametags.

17:39.308 --> 17:43.269
I'll be honest with you guys. When I first
met Ross, I didn't like him at all.

17:45.481 --> 17:48.858
But then once I got to know him,
I saw that he's really sweet...

17:49.109 --> 17:52.487
...and caring and very generous.

17:52.738 --> 17:56.532
I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross
before you get to know him, all right?

17:56.784 --> 18:01.704
You know, I like all of you guys now.
But when I first met you, you know...

18:01.872 --> 18:04.207
Kurt? I thought, you know, abrasive drunk.

18:05.876 --> 18:10.004
Um, Lola, mind-numbingly stupid.

18:11.590 --> 18:16.052
And, okay, you guys:
Gold digger, cradle-robbing perv.

18:18.347 --> 18:21.974
So I think you all know what I mean.

18:28.065 --> 18:31.067
Obviously, I didn't think
they were gonna start throwing things.

18:32.820 --> 18:36.155
I just thought if I kept insulting them
you would jump in and defend everyone.

18:36.365 --> 18:38.366
Then you could look like the hero.

18:38.575 --> 18:40.993
Oh, wow, yeah.

18:41.161 --> 18:42.995
See, I did not get that.

18:47.501 --> 18:50.545
Where's Monica? Where is she? I need
to talk to her, it's urgent. Is she here?

18:51.380 --> 18:54.924
- I'm Monica.
- I need to talk to you. It's urgent.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.635
- Okay.
- Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking...

18:57.886 --> 19:01.639
...about us. You know,
a lot of, uh, "us" thinking.

19:01.890 --> 19:06.352
And, uh, well, I guess there's
only one way to do this.

19:09.898 --> 19:12.900
- Wait, wait. What are you doing?
- Monica...

19:13.068 --> 19:14.402
No, no, no. Don't do it.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.195
Will you marry me?

19:20.117 --> 19:22.535
- Oh, no, no, no.
- What a bad idea.

19:22.786 --> 19:24.745
Oh, I can't not look at it.

19:26.874 --> 19:28.708
Chandler, why are you doing this?

19:28.876 --> 19:30.376
I don't know.

19:31.044 --> 19:33.462
But I know I'm not afraid to do this.

19:34.089 --> 19:35.548
Chandler.

19:35.716 --> 19:38.176
I'm doing this because I'm sorry?

19:40.470 --> 19:44.807
Do you, um, really think the best reason
to get married is because you're sorry?

19:45.058 --> 19:47.768
Oh, no, the best reason to get married
is pregnancy.

19:50.731 --> 19:54.650
Sorry is pretty much fourth, behind being
ready and actually wanting to get married.

19:56.111 --> 19:58.029
Will you be my wife?

20:00.407 --> 20:02.742
Chandler, um,
I want you to take just a minute...

20:02.910 --> 20:06.078
...and I want you to think about
how ridiculous this sounds.

20:09.833 --> 20:12.960
Yeah, I'm kind of wishing
everyone wasn't here right now.

20:15.547 --> 20:17.340
You know that none of that stuff
came from me.

20:17.591 --> 20:21.135
I mean, I never said that I wanted
to have babies and get married right now.

20:21.386 --> 20:24.597
Yeah, I know, I was really confused,
and then I talked to these guys.

20:24.848 --> 20:27.141
Who? Two divorces and Joey?

20:28.393 --> 20:30.645
- Hey.
- She's right, you know.

20:32.314 --> 20:35.233
Yeah, but still, cheap shot.

20:37.027 --> 20:39.862
You know when I said that I want you...

20:40.113 --> 20:43.199
...to deal with relationship stuff
all on your own?

20:43.450 --> 20:47.495
- Well, you're not ready for that.
- I didn't think I was.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.376
Oh, my God.

20:53.543 --> 20:56.212
What would you have done
if I had said yes?

20:56.463 --> 20:58.381
Well, I would've been happy because...

20:58.590 --> 21:02.343
...I would have been able spend
the rest of my life with the woman I love.

21:03.595 --> 21:06.889
Or you would have seen
a Chandler-shaped hole in that door.

21:12.980 --> 21:16.440
- Hey, Ross, will you pass me that knife?
- No, I will not.

21:16.608 --> 21:18.985
It's okay.
You don't have to be so mean about it.

21:19.152 --> 21:22.196
You're right. I'm sorry.
Will you marry me?

21:26.034 --> 21:27.785
Oh, and I was going to ask you
to marry me...

21:27.953 --> 21:30.496
...because I forgot to say hello to you
last week.

21:30.956 --> 21:33.165
Oh, no, wait, Pheebs.
I think with something like that...

21:33.333 --> 21:36.210
...you just ask them to move in with you.
But I'm not sure. Chandler?

21:36.378 --> 21:38.254
Ha, ha, okay,
how long is this gonna go on?

21:38.505 --> 21:40.506
Well, I think the length of teasing...

21:40.716 --> 21:43.342
...is directly related
to how insane you were.

21:43.510 --> 21:45.094
So a long time.

21:45.804 --> 21:49.557
This is fun. Oh, hey, Rach, remember
that whole "we were on a break" thing?

21:49.725 --> 21:51.767
Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?

21:57.983 --> 21:59.483
That's not funny.
