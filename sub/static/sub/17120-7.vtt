WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:02.640
I was just a boy when they came
to my village.

00:02.726 --> 00:04.554
Who?
- Henry Reed.

00:04.599 --> 00:07.599
With his army friend, a man called Stone.

00:07.677 --> 00:10.029
It's Brigadier now, Nadia.

00:10.078 --> 00:12.077
Sorry - force of habit.

00:12.211 --> 00:13.739
Do you know Mrs Herz?

00:13.740 --> 00:16.740
I have had the pleasure.
Back in Iraq, she was a mess.

00:17.055 --> 00:19.454
Who was with you?
Who was it, Mr Stone?

00:19.526 --> 00:21.415
Give me the name!

00:24.051 --> 00:26.721
He attacked me. He hurt me.

00:26.775 --> 00:27.851
He was confused.

00:27.876 --> 00:32.484
I found pictures, Kristian.
Pictures of the girl.

00:33.142 --> 00:36.111
People need to know who you are.

00:36.136 --> 00:39.136
No-one here believes a word you say.
What are you doing?

00:39.213 --> 00:42.494
I couldn't lie in a hospital,
waiting for the devil to take me.

00:44.273 --> 00:47.679
What did you do to my sister? Go on!

00:49.740 --> 00:52.740
You got hurt. You have
fractured ribs. Don't try and move.

00:53.059 --> 00:56.059
You should come down to the station
and turn yourself in.

00:56.221 --> 00:58.009
For what you did to my dad.

00:58.010 --> 00:59.249
'You're lost.'

00:59.250 --> 01:02.648
I am not lost, Miss Stone.
I know exactly where I am.

01:02.908 --> 01:05.908
I believe that finding out the truth
of what happened all those years ago

01:05.933 --> 01:09.513
in Iraq, will help explain
why Alice Webster was taken.

01:09.917 --> 01:12.917
And, more importantly,
who it was that took her.

01:13.528 --> 01:16.113
I'll tell you what I know.

01:20.398 --> 01:22.406
This was us back then.

01:23.047 --> 01:26.055
Me, Henry Reed, Adrian Stone.

01:27.285 --> 01:28.820
Christ.

01:30.096 --> 01:33.096
I don't even remember
this photo being taken.

01:39.050 --> 01:40.643
Why do you keep looking out there?

01:40.668 --> 01:42.659
Please. Keep talking.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:56.214 --> 01:59.214
Tell me what happened with
Adrian Stone and Henry Reed.

02:00.486 --> 02:03.486
Stone talked about
"the three of us". Who did he mean?

02:06.078 --> 02:09.695
You know what I'm talking about.
Don't you, Mrs Herz?

02:11.530 --> 02:14.459
I have a witness. Still in Iraq.
Mirza Barzani.

02:14.484 --> 02:16.342
I can take this
to the military courts.

02:16.367 --> 02:17.866
I can take it to the press.

02:17.927 --> 02:21.888
But... time is not on my side.
And I want the truth.

02:38.530 --> 02:40.701
I've never told anyone this.

02:42.020 --> 02:44.420
Then, is it not time that you did?

02:53.908 --> 02:56.908
My time in the Gulf was... difficult.

02:59.177 --> 03:03.223
I was promoted too soon, younger
than most people I was commanding.

03:04.482 --> 03:07.903
Drinking the days away,
not sleeping, wired.

03:09.770 --> 03:12.982
Years later, I was diagnosed
with Gulf War Syndrome.

03:14.208 --> 03:16.012
But at the time...

03:17.091 --> 03:21.637
At the time, I just shut my mouth,
like a good soldier.

03:22.908 --> 03:24.317
Ma'am.

03:24.537 --> 03:27.537
Captains Stone and Reed to see you, ma'am.
- Wait!

03:33.820 --> 03:35.405
Send them in.

03:35.514 --> 03:38.514
Captain Stone,
the major will see you now.

03:43.091 --> 03:44.114
Yeah?

03:44.139 --> 03:46.618
Lieutenant Gettrick's been outside
the wire four days now.

03:46.643 --> 03:48.926
We need to take some troops
and look for him.

03:48.967 --> 03:50.200
He's gone walkabout.

03:50.225 --> 03:51.678
Isn't that what you're all doing?

03:51.703 --> 03:54.725
Going out and banging the locals before
going home to your wives and girlfriends?

03:54.750 --> 03:57.990
With respect...
- With respect, Adrian, he's a big boy.

03:58.048 --> 03:59.813
He knows we're being relieved
in two days.

03:59.838 --> 04:01.868
He'll come back when he remembers
that and realises

04:01.893 --> 04:03.292
just how many STDs he's racked up.

04:03.317 --> 04:07.043
Last thing I need is even more
of you buggering off to indulge yourselves.

04:07.162 --> 04:09.752
Stay put.
That's a bloody order, OK?

04:09.777 --> 04:10.777
But, ma'am...

04:10.802 --> 04:13.652
I don't remember asking
for your opinion, Captain Stone.

04:13.912 --> 04:15.245
Get out.

04:24.130 --> 04:25.899
Reed and Stone came to me for help,

04:25.900 --> 04:28.779
looking for Adam, and I...

04:28.780 --> 04:31.780
..I told them no.

04:32.530 --> 04:35.530
I thought he was out having fun
like the rest of them.

04:38.890 --> 04:41.890
If I'd had any idea...

04:49.647 --> 04:52.647
The war was over,
but it was far from safe.

04:54.137 --> 04:56.896
But Adrian was always
a reckless bastard.

04:56.897 --> 04:59.897
He took Henry Reed and went out
to find Adam Gettrick,

05:00.647 --> 05:03.647
against my orders, with no back up
and only each other for protection.

05:06.178 --> 05:07.456
Relax.

05:07.457 --> 05:08.646
Why?

05:08.647 --> 05:11.576
First we jump the wire, then we nick
a translator's car to do it.

05:11.577 --> 05:14.577
You medics worry too much.
You don't worry enough.

05:22.178 --> 05:23.816
Do you even know where he went?

05:23.817 --> 05:25.896
It was a house he showed
me on patrol.

05:25.897 --> 05:28.897
Girl he was seeing. We start there,
find out what the girl knows.

06:25.490 --> 06:27.659
American? British?

06:27.660 --> 06:29.749
I'm Captain Stone.
I'm looking for my friend of mine.

06:29.750 --> 06:32.750
Adam Gettrick.

06:33.700 --> 06:34.769
Leave it.

06:34.770 --> 06:36.769
I found him in bed with my daughter.

06:36.770 --> 06:38.589
You know how old my daughter?

06:38.590 --> 06:41.590
13. And I tell him get out.
Just like I tell you.

06:43.780 --> 06:45.860
And he ran off.

06:45.861 --> 06:48.861
I tell him never come back.

06:53.238 --> 06:56.238
OK, then.

07:05.691 --> 07:07.120
Jesus.

07:07.121 --> 07:09.050
Did you see that tattoo
on his hand?

07:09.090 --> 07:10.619
Republican Guard.

07:10.729 --> 07:12.768
So?
- The war's over.

07:14.051 --> 07:16.050
I'm just wondering.

07:16.051 --> 07:19.040
A guy like that finds Adam
with his 13-year-old daughter

07:19.041 --> 07:20.380
and he just lets him go?

07:20.381 --> 07:22.474
13. Christ. Did you have any idea
she was that young?

07:22.499 --> 07:25.216
Of course I didn't!
- 13's not much older than Eve.

07:25.241 --> 07:28.241
We can't take his word for it.
Not someone like that.

07:29.092 --> 07:31.201
We need to get a look
inside that house.

07:31.226 --> 07:33.619
For all we know, Adam could be
shacked up with someone else.

07:33.682 --> 07:36.804
You saw how he acted back there.
Do you really believe that?

07:38.972 --> 07:41.020
Look, if you're right,

07:41.021 --> 07:43.200
if that guy's done something
with Adam,

07:43.201 --> 07:44.849
then... we're out on our own.

07:44.874 --> 07:48.224
Adam's one of us, Henry. If he's
in trouble, he needs our help.

07:49.799 --> 07:51.615
I say we wait.

07:51.842 --> 07:53.740
Wait for our chance to get in.

07:53.741 --> 07:56.741
How long?
- As long as it takes.

08:00.251 --> 08:03.251
♪ Oh, my love

08:03.852 --> 08:06.852
♪ We pray each day

08:07.371 --> 08:10.371
♪ May you come home

08:11.241 --> 08:14.241
♪ And be OK

08:22.092 --> 08:24.620
♪ For now we'll wait

08:24.621 --> 08:27.621
♪ For you, for you

08:28.131 --> 08:31.131
♪ To come home. ♪

09:14.921 --> 09:17.921
Maybe we should go after her.
Ask her about Adam.

09:28.531 --> 09:31.531
I say now's our chance
to get in there.

09:33.211 --> 09:36.211
While he's still inside?

09:36.291 --> 09:39.101
Well, he's not going anywhere
and we need to get in!

09:39.102 --> 09:40.690
If Adam had really been turned away,

09:40.691 --> 09:43.691
he would have come back
to camp by now.

09:45.011 --> 09:47.920
This is wrong. This is all wrong.

09:47.921 --> 09:50.921
That's why we're here.
To make whatever this is right.

11:28.891 --> 11:31.891
Reed.

11:53.811 --> 11:55.250
Get the hell out!

11:55.251 --> 11:58.251
Back off, Stone.

13:28.901 --> 13:31.901
Jesus.

13:43.381 --> 13:45.290
Oh, Jesus.

13:45.291 --> 13:48.291
Bloody hell, Gettrick.
Let's get you out of here, eh?

13:59.621 --> 14:02.410
He's barely breathing. We need to
check the extent of his injuries.

14:02.411 --> 14:05.411
Help me put him on his side.

14:06.821 --> 14:09.060
Can you hear me, Adam?

14:09.061 --> 14:12.061
Stone? I'm here. Me and Reed.
You're going to be OK.

14:27.461 --> 14:30.461
Jesus Christ!

14:35.621 --> 14:38.180
The key, he has it.

14:38.181 --> 14:39.431
He has it.

14:54.070 --> 14:56.515
We need to get out of here.
I know!

14:57.456 --> 14:59.320
Get him on his feet.

15:10.357 --> 15:12.763
No-one can know we were here.

15:45.911 --> 15:48.620
She was 13!
What the hell was he thinking?!

15:48.621 --> 15:50.140
Leave off!

15:50.141 --> 15:53.141
Where... where is the rest
of the unit?

15:53.189 --> 15:56.148
We went to Nadia.
She ordered us to stay put.

15:56.376 --> 15:58.095
Come on. We've got to go!

15:58.120 --> 15:59.609
I've been gone four days!

15:59.711 --> 16:01.861
That bitch has slept through
the last week, why...

16:01.862 --> 16:04.060
why would she give an order
like that?

16:04.061 --> 16:06.370
Did she want me to die out here?
Four fucking days!

16:06.371 --> 16:08.420
She should have had people
looking for me.

16:08.421 --> 16:11.421
She was supposed to protect us!
We have to get out of here!

16:19.651 --> 16:21.300
We decided it would be best

16:21.301 --> 16:24.301
not to let Command know
what had happened to Adam.

16:27.191 --> 16:29.070
If they learned how
I'd been running the camp,

16:29.071 --> 16:32.071
what a shit-show I'd made of it...

16:34.621 --> 16:37.621
I let them all run riot.

16:37.631 --> 16:40.631
And then when Adam Gettrick
needed me, I didn't send help.

16:42.181 --> 16:45.181
Adam Gettrick.

16:48.393 --> 16:51.393
The third person
Stone spoke of is Adam Gettrick.

16:54.250 --> 16:57.250
He got taken on my watch.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
That's all you know?

17:06.711 --> 17:09.559
What do you mean?

17:09.560 --> 17:12.560
Mirza, the boy they let escape,
from Iraq.

17:14.680 --> 17:17.680
He told us everything he saw.

17:19.040 --> 17:22.040
The events that followed,
after what happened in that house.

17:24.240 --> 17:27.240
And you should know the truth.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
It's OK, it's OK.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
Stone,
there's another girl in the house!

18:27.721 --> 18:30.721
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

18:31.760 --> 18:34.760
I'm so, so sorry.

18:37.650 --> 18:40.650
We have to go. Now!

18:42.640 --> 18:45.640
What is your name? Your full name?

18:46.870 --> 18:49.870
Mirza Barzani. Reed!

19:04.680 --> 19:07.680
How old was the little girl?

19:07.711 --> 19:10.711
Nine years old.

19:11.800 --> 19:14.319
But nobody believed it was done
by English soldiers

19:14.320 --> 19:15.869
in the middle of the night.

19:15.870 --> 19:18.870
He was an imaginative child.
The father, a drunk.

19:19.400 --> 19:22.400
It was thought to be an accident.

19:27.480 --> 19:30.480
They told me what had happened
to Adam.

19:31.920 --> 19:34.920
They told me what they did
to the man who hurt him.

19:37.150 --> 19:39.199
And I kept quiet.

19:39.200 --> 19:41.429
You knew they killed a man
and you said nothing?

19:41.430 --> 19:43.489
Men had died.

19:43.490 --> 19:46.490
Better men than the one
they killed - one of Saddam's.

19:50.560 --> 19:52.399
And like I say, I wasn't there.

19:52.400 --> 19:55.149
I mean, I was, but I was...

19:55.150 --> 19:58.150
I was in pain and I was numbing it
with drink and pills.

20:00.690 --> 20:03.690
My mind had gone AWOL.

20:04.490 --> 20:07.039
If it got out, it'd undo everything
we did out there.

20:07.040 --> 20:10.040
I gave them an alibi.

20:12.961 --> 20:15.710
But I...

20:15.711 --> 20:18.711
I had no idea...

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
No idea about the girl. I swear.

20:25.200 --> 20:27.399
Tell me about Adam.

20:27.400 --> 20:30.400
He... he got injured
in Afghanistan in 2001.

20:33.601 --> 20:36.359
They offered him
a medical discharge,

20:36.360 --> 20:38.869
but he chose to stay with the Army.

20:38.870 --> 20:41.870
They moved him sideways.
Ended up as press liaison.

20:42.721 --> 20:45.721
Have you ever had any sense of...

20:47.570 --> 20:49.639
..another side to him?

20:49.640 --> 20:51.509
His life?

20:51.510 --> 20:54.510
That he might be capable
of taking someone?

20:55.240 --> 20:57.960
I don't understand.

20:57.961 --> 20:59.289
Taking who?

20:59.290 --> 21:02.209
Alice Webster and Sophie Giroux.

21:02.210 --> 21:05.210
But my husband...

21:07.280 --> 21:10.280
They found him guilty. It was...

21:13.870 --> 21:16.769
There were pictures on the camera.
It was my husband.

21:16.770 --> 21:19.770
Your husband was a prominent figure
in the community, yes?

21:21.880 --> 21:23.999
Did Adam Gettrick
ever come to the shop?

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
Er, yes. Sometimes, I suppose.

21:28.410 --> 21:31.410
He would have known your
husband's hobby. Bird-watching.

21:31.510 --> 21:32.919
Most people did.

21:32.920 --> 21:35.149
So he knew your husband
was often away.

21:35.150 --> 21:38.150
And it seems likely he bore
a grudge against you,

21:38.640 --> 21:41.159
that he blamed you for what
happened to him.

21:41.160 --> 21:44.160
You're saying he framed my husband?

21:46.800 --> 21:49.800
Well, that can't...
That's impossible. It can't be true.

21:51.360 --> 21:54.360
Just because you're tortured,
it doesn't mean...

21:55.050 --> 21:58.050
you abduct two little girls and
keep them prisoner in your house.

21:58.280 --> 21:59.590
Of course not.

21:59.591 --> 22:02.591
Adam Gettrick was a monster long
before he entered that basement.

22:07.711 --> 22:10.711
I've told you everything I know.

22:11.721 --> 22:14.721
Now get out of my house!

22:14.920 --> 22:17.850
I'm sorry to have upset you,
Mrs Herz.

22:17.851 --> 22:20.851
You should know only that
I believe your husband.

22:21.210 --> 22:23.649
And perhaps with luck,

22:23.650 --> 22:26.239
he will one day be a free man.

22:26.240 --> 22:29.240
I said get out!

23:13.490 --> 23:16.490
I'm just going down the shops.
Do you want anything?

23:16.650 --> 23:19.650
No.

23:20.410 --> 23:23.410
So, do you want me to leave
the house or, you know...?

23:31.280 --> 23:34.280
I meant to show you this
the other day, but...

23:35.130 --> 23:38.130
Well...

23:40.240 --> 23:43.079
Now look at that...

23:43.080 --> 23:46.080
..and tell me that I'm crazy.

23:50.718 --> 23:52.257
Where did you get this?

23:52.258 --> 23:54.037
Julien Baptiste and Jorn Lenhart...

23:54.038 --> 23:57.038
But it doesn't matter
where it came from.

23:57.692 --> 23:59.732
Look at it.

23:59.733 --> 24:02.733
Look at that and tell me
that that's not our daughter.

24:04.372 --> 24:06.031
That's our girl.

24:06.032 --> 24:08.681
This girl sitting next to her,
that could be anybody. No.

24:08.682 --> 24:10.881
No, Sam. That is Alice.

24:10.882 --> 24:13.882
And that girl came back
to live here, in our house.

24:14.372 --> 24:15.571
That's an impostor.

24:15.572 --> 24:18.572
You're just seeing what you
want to see. And you're not?

24:18.682 --> 24:21.682
You know I'm right.

24:22.522 --> 24:25.211
You know I am,
deep down you must do.

24:25.212 --> 24:27.031
And even if you didn't
in the beginning,

24:27.032 --> 24:30.032
by the time she set fire
to that shed, you knew.

24:31.242 --> 24:34.242
Why are you doing this to yourself?

24:35.002 --> 24:38.002
It's destroying you.

24:39.442 --> 24:42.442
I told Eve to keep the baby.

24:43.882 --> 24:46.882
Why?

24:47.132 --> 24:49.151
I don't understand.
This is her decision.

24:49.152 --> 24:51.401
Why would you do that?

24:51.402 --> 24:52.592
This is your mess.

24:52.593 --> 24:53.921
It was an accident.

24:53.922 --> 24:56.881
Yeah. You didn't mean
to get her pregnant.

24:56.882 --> 24:59.882
Sure. I know that.

25:00.652 --> 25:03.321
You didn't mean to have an affair
right under my nose.

25:03.322 --> 25:05.571
But it happened.

25:05.572 --> 25:08.572
And there are consequences.

25:12.128 --> 25:15.128
You know how much
I wanted another baby.

25:39.578 --> 25:42.578
Maybe if we'd got out of
this place...

25:42.878 --> 25:45.878
I wasn't ready to leave.

25:49.398 --> 25:52.398
I don't know if we can come back
from this...

25:53.518 --> 25:56.518
..but I want to try.

26:06.729 --> 26:09.729
I'm sorry.

26:10.368 --> 26:13.368
But it's too late.

26:25.928 --> 26:28.928
Matthew!

26:36.758 --> 26:38.517
What's wrong?

26:38.518 --> 26:40.107
I'm just tired. That's all.

26:40.108 --> 26:42.087
Who were you out with last night?

26:42.088 --> 26:44.858
A friend. Yeah, but which friend?

26:44.859 --> 26:46.728
All of a sudden you give a shit?

26:46.729 --> 26:49.729
Hey. Hey!

26:51.678 --> 26:54.678
What's that? What happened?

26:54.958 --> 26:57.958
You done? Cos I'm tired.

27:31.038 --> 27:32.287
Mr Baptiste.

27:32.288 --> 27:35.288
Please. Sit. We don't have long.

27:37.398 --> 27:40.398
What? Take a seat, Mr Gettrick.

27:50.729 --> 27:53.729
You are not a stupid man,
so I will not treat you as such.

27:56.518 --> 27:59.367
To do what you have done all these
years - to pull the wool over

27:59.368 --> 28:02.368
the eyes of the world
is no small feat.

28:04.398 --> 28:07.398
Why did you tell Sophie to pretend
she was Alice Webster?

28:10.368 --> 28:13.368
I'm sorry. I'm not sure...
We do not have time for this.

28:13.568 --> 28:16.568
I need to know if the real
Alice Webster is still alive.

28:17.859 --> 28:19.647
You've made a mistake, Mr Baptiste.

28:19.648 --> 28:22.157
Now... I only came down here
as a courtesy...

28:22.158 --> 28:25.158
I know what happened
back in 1991, in Iraq.

28:28.078 --> 28:31.078
I know your taste in women.

28:31.238 --> 28:34.238
Or girls, I should say.

28:36.218 --> 28:39.218
I know you had access to everything
we did during this investigation.

28:50.729 --> 28:53.729
They arrived sooner
than I'd anticipated.

28:59.008 --> 29:02.008
With respect, it sounds like you
don't have a damn clue, Detective.

29:04.018 --> 29:07.018
Aren't you seeing things?

29:07.378 --> 29:10.378
Hallucinating.

29:10.648 --> 29:12.647
I heard what you did
at the cookhouse.

29:12.648 --> 29:14.207
Yes!

29:14.208 --> 29:17.208
I am seeing things - clearly -
for the first time in a long time.

29:17.758 --> 29:20.758
Your mind is more diseased
than my own.

29:23.648 --> 29:26.648
Tell me, what have you
done with Alice?

29:27.758 --> 29:30.758
Why would you say such
an awful thing to me?

29:31.218 --> 29:34.218
What gives you
the right to accuse me?

29:35.368 --> 29:37.007
I know it was you.

29:37.008 --> 29:40.008
I'm coming, but I ask that you take
this man into custody also.

29:40.938 --> 29:43.938
On what grounds? On the grounds
that he abducted Sophie Giroux

29:44.398 --> 29:47.087
and Alice Webster.

29:47.088 --> 29:49.327
I honestly have no idea
what he's going on about.

29:49.328 --> 29:52.328
He asked to see me and then
he's just started accusing me.

29:52.489 --> 29:54.728
Started calling me Kristian Herz,

29:54.729 --> 29:57.729
like he thinks I'm him
or something.

29:58.198 --> 30:00.957
You need to come with us.
We need to ask you some questions.

30:00.958 --> 30:03.017
You're making a big mistake,
Sergeant!

30:03.018 --> 30:06.018
It's not a request.

30:06.058 --> 30:09.058
I'm coming.

30:10.888 --> 30:13.888
Don't touch me!

30:27.288 --> 30:30.288
Staff Sergeant Stone has informed
me you are not well,

30:30.479 --> 30:33.479
that you are seeing things
that are not there,

30:33.758 --> 30:36.117
that there have been
aggressive outbursts.

30:36.118 --> 30:38.097
I am of sound mind. Believe me.

30:38.098 --> 30:40.877
But this is a matter
of some urgency.

30:40.878 --> 30:43.878
The abduction of Alice Webster -
I don't believe Kristian Herz

30:44.128 --> 30:45.247
to be responsible.

30:45.248 --> 30:48.117
I believe it was another man -
Adam Gettrick.

30:48.118 --> 30:50.337
He is the press liaison
for the garrison.

30:50.338 --> 30:53.338
Mr Baptiste, you went to speak
with Adrian Stone last night?

30:53.688 --> 30:55.407
Listen, whatever it is you think...

30:55.408 --> 30:58.408
And you were ejected for aggravating
him. He is in hospital now.

30:59.898 --> 31:01.767
His injuries are severe.

31:01.768 --> 31:04.738
You cannot think me responsible...
You are a detective.

31:04.739 --> 31:06.478
You tell me how this looks.

31:06.479 --> 31:08.017
You were the last to see him.

31:08.018 --> 31:10.017
You were found physically
harassing him...

31:10.018 --> 31:12.367
He attacked me!
I was defending myself.

31:12.368 --> 31:14.927
So that is your position,
you were defending yourself?

31:14.928 --> 31:16.567
I didn't put him in the hospital.

31:16.568 --> 31:19.047
He says you did.
He is confused!

31:19.048 --> 31:22.048
With respect, Mr Baptiste,
so are you. Confused and angry.

31:23.118 --> 31:25.317
You need to bring in Adam Gettrick.

31:25.318 --> 31:28.318
Alice herself identified
Herr Kristian Herz.

31:29.088 --> 31:32.088
It wouldn't be the first thing
that girl lied about.

31:32.178 --> 31:33.767
Mr Baptiste, I have great respect

31:33.768 --> 31:35.767
for all the work you have
done in your life.

31:35.768 --> 31:38.728
And what happened last night,
I do not believe it was intended.

31:38.729 --> 31:41.677
But you are ill.

31:41.678 --> 31:43.608
The courts will understand that.

31:43.609 --> 31:46.609
But first you have to confess
to what you have done.

31:47.609 --> 31:50.609
Arrest me, or bring me a lawyer.
Everything else is wasting time.

31:51.538 --> 31:54.538
Very well, Mr Baptiste. Then
you will be our guest this evening.

31:55.678 --> 31:58.678
Vous faites perdre le temps de tout
le monde, vous etes tout incapable!

32:00.479 --> 32:02.197
Alter, kranker spinner.

32:02.198 --> 32:05.198
Imbeciles!

32:23.888 --> 32:26.488
Yeah, I need you to get me a number.

32:26.489 --> 32:29.489
Celia Baptiste.

32:42.658 --> 32:45.007
We don't have to do this.

32:45.008 --> 32:46.917
They're being re-deployed tomorrow,
Sam.

32:46.918 --> 32:49.017
They're your men.
You know we have to do this.

32:49.018 --> 32:51.687
All right, then, we go in and we
show our faces and then we leave.

32:51.688 --> 32:54.688
No-one needs to know about us.
All right?

32:57.128 --> 32:58.917
Oi-oi!

32:58.918 --> 33:01.207
Picked a great day for it, eh?

33:01.208 --> 33:04.207
Rock The Casbah
by The Clash

33:28.058 --> 33:31.058
Sorry.

33:48.408 --> 33:51.007
I didn't know you were
going to be here.

33:51.008 --> 33:53.047
Melissa and I are old friends.

33:53.048 --> 33:56.048
We were at Aldershot together.
Right.

33:56.168 --> 33:59.168
Yeah. So...
I should probablyjust...

33:59.558 --> 34:02.527
We're going to have to learn how to
deal with each other, aren't we?

34:02.528 --> 34:05.528
Especially when you start showing.

34:05.768 --> 34:08.768
It shouldn't be too complicated,
though, cos...

34:09.007 --> 34:12.007
it's over between me and Sam, so...

34:15.619 --> 34:18.619
Just so you know - that doesn't
mean that me and Sam will...

34:18.888 --> 34:21.556
I really don't care if it does, Eve.

34:21.558 --> 34:23.897
Well, I do. And I'm sorry.

34:23.898 --> 34:26.898
It sounds...

34:27.848 --> 34:30.848
But...

34:35.928 --> 34:38.277
I shouldn't have come.

34:38.277 --> 34:41.277
My dad's lying in a hospital bed
because a couple of nights ago,

34:41.888 --> 34:44.888
someone came and beat him
half to death at the care home.

34:47.688 --> 34:50.688
Christ.

34:52.257 --> 34:55.257
Do they know who did it?

34:57.458 --> 35:00.458
I'm sorry.

35:00.609 --> 35:03.609
Excuse me.

35:30.118 --> 35:32.777
What's wrong, Lucy?

35:32.778 --> 35:34.977
I left Mr Squibbles at home.

35:34.978 --> 35:37.618
Because you made us leave
so quickly.

35:37.619 --> 35:39.647
Well, we can't go back.

35:39.648 --> 35:42.217
We're going to the new house
sooner than we thought.

35:42.218 --> 35:45.127
You'll like it there.
I like Mr Squibbles.

35:45.128 --> 35:48.128
Well, we'll find you a new toy.
It won't be the same.

35:48.418 --> 35:51.418
It's the same if I say
it's the same! OK?

35:55.848 --> 35:58.848
Do you think she's OK?

36:01.268 --> 36:04.268
She's fine.

36:10.568 --> 36:12.567
Sorry. Sam. Sam, can I have a word?

36:12.568 --> 36:15.568
Yeah, sure.

36:15.619 --> 36:18.177
What is it?

36:18.178 --> 36:20.287
Brigadier Stone was attacked.

36:20.288 --> 36:22.807
Is he all right?
Well, he's in hospital.

36:22.808 --> 36:25.368
But on the same day, Julien Baptiste
came by and told me that...

36:25.369 --> 36:27.817
Well, he told me that he thought
that Stone was involved

36:27.818 --> 36:29.167
in Alice's abduction.

36:29.168 --> 36:31.047
Why would he say that?

36:31.048 --> 36:33.047
Matthew was there.
He heard the whole thing,

36:33.048 --> 36:35.488
and then he went storming off
to go and see those Adler boys.

36:35.489 --> 36:38.489
What, you think..?

36:41.698 --> 36:44.457
You know the reputation
those Adler twins have got.

36:44.458 --> 36:46.618
There are rumours that they put
Nadia Herz in hospital.

36:46.619 --> 36:47.897
You think Matthew assaulted him?

36:47.898 --> 36:49.618
You think he could do
something like that?

36:49.619 --> 36:52.087
You know what he's like these days.
You saw his hands.

36:52.088 --> 36:55.088
And the way he went off, honestly,
Sam, it does, it makes sense.

37:19.818 --> 37:22.727
Matthew!

37:22.728 --> 37:24.207
Matthew!

37:26.058 --> 37:27.137
What?

37:27.138 --> 37:30.138
Can you come downstairs, please?

37:30.268 --> 37:33.268
Now.

37:49.992 --> 37:51.811
Sit down.
I'm fine here.

37:51.812 --> 37:54.812
Sit down.

37:55.322 --> 37:57.482
What's happened to you, Matthew?

37:57.483 --> 38:00.483
What's happened to ME?
Take a look at you both.

38:01.363 --> 38:04.363
Those men you're hanging around
with, the Adler twins...

38:04.473 --> 38:07.041
They're my friends.
And anyway, I'm an adult, I can...

38:07.042 --> 38:09.271
You're an adult who lives in our
house. And you're our son.

38:09.272 --> 38:11.421
We're trying to help you
and if you can't see that...

38:11.422 --> 38:14.422
All you're trying to do is find
problems somewhere else... Stop it!

38:15.792 --> 38:18.191
Christ.

38:18.192 --> 38:21.192
Now what happened to your hand?

38:22.522 --> 38:25.321
I cut it. Broke a pint glass.

38:25.322 --> 38:27.711
Is that how you got
the bruising on there?

38:27.712 --> 38:30.712
You overheard Baptiste telling me
that he thought Stone was involved

38:31.353 --> 38:34.121
in Alice's disappearance.
And then you stormed out,

38:34.122 --> 38:36.321
and you went to the only place
that you ever go to.

38:36.322 --> 38:37.961
To see those Adler boys.

38:37.962 --> 38:40.962
So? So Brigadier Stone
is in hospital now.

38:42.613 --> 38:45.613
What, and you think I had something
to do with it? Well, did you?

38:47.353 --> 38:49.761
This is it, isn't it?

38:49.762 --> 38:51.551
This is who I am to you.

38:51.552 --> 38:54.552
I'm just the monster that locked his
sister in the shed to you, aren't I?

38:54.922 --> 38:57.711
The one that goes around
putting old men in hospital...

38:57.712 --> 39:00.321
Matthew... And what if
what you said was right? Huh?

39:00.322 --> 39:03.322
What if he did have something
to do with Alice being taken?

39:03.412 --> 39:06.412
And you're all sitting around
doing nothing. What then?

39:07.172 --> 39:08.791
I'm a hero, aren't I?

39:08.792 --> 39:11.761
So you admit it? You've been
following orders all your life -

39:11.762 --> 39:14.762
from the headmaster, from your
superiors, walking the line,

39:16.162 --> 39:18.321
ticking the boxes,
and where has that got you?

39:18.322 --> 39:21.322
That's enough... You're miserable.

39:22.032 --> 39:25.032
You're lying to each other.

39:27.402 --> 39:30.402
You know he's screwing
someone else, right?

39:38.473 --> 39:41.473
So before you go round
asking what's happened to me,

39:42.142 --> 39:45.142
why don't you take a look
at yourselves?

40:01.632 --> 40:04.271
Mr Baptiste.

40:04.272 --> 40:07.272
Mr Baptiste!

40:07.762 --> 40:09.472
You're free to leave.

40:09.473 --> 40:12.473
You've kept me for... what?

40:12.762 --> 40:15.762
So you might find evidence
that does not exist?

40:16.552 --> 40:19.352
Before you leave,
there is somebody to see you.

40:19.353 --> 40:22.353
If it's all the same to you...

40:51.122 --> 40:53.041
Eve Stone called you.

40:53.042 --> 40:56.001
Mm-hm.

40:56.002 --> 40:59.002
She's worried about you.

41:04.402 --> 41:05.991
Don't.

41:05.992 --> 41:08.992
If there is something you can solve,
there is no use in worrying.

41:11.142 --> 41:13.492
And if there is something
you cannot fix,

41:13.493 --> 41:16.493
there is still no use in worrying.

41:17.512 --> 41:20.512
It won't help you.

41:23.642 --> 41:26.642
How could you do this to us?

41:28.282 --> 41:31.282
How could you walk away
from that operation?

41:31.332 --> 41:34.151
I wasn't walking away from anything.

41:34.152 --> 41:37.152
I was walking towards
something else.

41:37.722 --> 41:40.721
Towards some kind of resolution
for two little girls

41:40.722 --> 41:43.612
whose lives were stolen from them.

41:43.613 --> 41:46.613
I was walking towards something...
I thought was bigger than myself.

41:50.412 --> 41:53.412
You're a brilliant, loving man,

41:54.233 --> 41:56.771
and an amazing detective

41:56.772 --> 41:59.772
and you've achieved
incredible things.

42:00.762 --> 42:02.791
But right now?

42:02.792 --> 42:05.792
You're a child, Julien.

42:06.712 --> 42:09.712
A selfish child.

42:09.872 --> 42:12.872
You'll storm into a building
armed with a loaded gun,

42:14.282 --> 42:16.362
risking your life to make an arrest,

42:16.363 --> 42:19.363
but you won't take the same risk
for the people who love you.

42:21.363 --> 42:23.612
This... job.

42:23.613 --> 42:26.352
This obsession.

42:26.353 --> 42:29.353
This addiction.

42:29.522 --> 42:32.522
You're no better than, than...
Tony Hughes.

42:35.072 --> 42:38.072
Getting lost in all the darkness
that surrounds you.

42:38.233 --> 42:41.233
Thinking you can fix everything
and find the light switch.

42:45.762 --> 42:48.352
It has to end.

42:48.353 --> 42:51.353
You have to come home.

42:52.613 --> 42:54.591
I am so close.

42:54.592 --> 42:57.592
You're always so close.

42:59.882 --> 43:02.882
But right now?

43:03.202 --> 43:06.202
You're dying.

43:06.872 --> 43:09.362
You're lost, my love,

43:09.363 --> 43:12.363
and the tide is coming in.

43:40.282 --> 43:43.071
Wait. Wait, come on. He's our son.

43:43.072 --> 43:45.601
This isn't right...
You think I want to do this?

43:45.602 --> 43:47.232
I've lost you.
I've lost my daughter...

43:47.233 --> 43:48.691
If I do this
then I lose my son as well.

43:48.692 --> 43:51.692
And if we do nothing,
isn't he lost anyway?

43:52.842 --> 43:54.841
If there's a chance
this will save him...

43:54.842 --> 43:56.151
By locking him up?

43:58.353 --> 44:00.871
Do you know what I think?

44:00.872 --> 44:03.872
Sometimes - and it's awful...

44:05.132 --> 44:07.851
..but we were happier
before she came back.

44:07.852 --> 44:10.852
You know, we were grieving...

44:11.332 --> 44:14.332
but we had her in common.

44:14.363 --> 44:17.363
The three of us.

44:22.412 --> 44:25.412
We have to save Matthew
from himself.

44:26.842 --> 44:29.842
Before he does something even worse.

44:41.692 --> 44:43.841
Mr and Mrs Webster,
I must talk with you.

44:43.842 --> 44:46.001
Get out of my way.
Listen, I have found something.

44:46.002 --> 44:47.411
This is on you, this is.

44:47.412 --> 44:49.761
Coming here, filling our family's
heads with crap,

44:49.762 --> 44:51.242
telling us Alice is still alive.

44:51.243 --> 44:53.731
Matthew has done what he's done
because he overheard you

44:53.732 --> 44:56.161
with your stupid accusations.
He's trying to help you!

44:56.162 --> 44:59.131
Well, he hasn't. Cos ever since he
turned up, bad things are happening.

44:59.132 --> 45:01.331
Listen, there's nothing more
in the world that I want

45:01.332 --> 45:02.761
than for my husband to come home.

45:02.762 --> 45:05.762
He's walked away from an operation
that could help save his life

45:05.842 --> 45:08.841
to come out here and find out
what happened to your girl.

45:08.842 --> 45:11.711
He's walked away from me,
from his daughter.

45:11.712 --> 45:14.411
And I'm telling you, there is
no way he would have done all that

45:14.412 --> 45:15.921
unless he thought it was worth it.

45:15.922 --> 45:18.321
I have no problem with you.

45:18.322 --> 45:20.691
But this - this is about
my life and my family.

45:20.692 --> 45:23.692
Listen, I have never lost hope
that we might learn the truth

45:23.872 --> 45:26.161
about your daughter
and Sophie Giroux.

45:26.162 --> 45:28.991
And now I have finally
found the truth.

45:28.992 --> 45:31.992
The man who abducted Sophie and
Alice works right here in Eckhausen.

45:34.762 --> 45:36.761
His name is Adam Gettrick.

45:36.762 --> 45:39.762
Gettrick?

45:40.562 --> 45:43.562
You're serious? I spoke with him,
before I was arrested.

45:43.842 --> 45:45.591
I saw it.

45:45.592 --> 45:47.001
In his eyes.

45:47.002 --> 45:49.081
You saw it in his eyes?!

45:49.082 --> 45:52.082
Jesus. Do you believe this?

45:55.122 --> 45:57.362
What are we going to do
about Matthew?

45:57.363 --> 45:59.931
He's what matters now.
What if he's right?

45:59.932 --> 46:02.932
My daughter died.

46:03.012 --> 46:06.012
How many times do you want me
to bury her?

46:06.852 --> 46:09.852
I won't do this.

46:10.002 --> 46:13.002
I can't do this.

46:31.132 --> 46:33.511
So what do we do now?

46:33.512 --> 46:36.512
Gettrick knows I suspect him.

46:36.932 --> 46:39.871
We will have to move quickly.

46:39.872 --> 46:42.031
Did you tell the police?
They don't believe me.

46:42.032 --> 46:45.032
Jorn Lenhart would be an ally,
but he is not answering.

46:45.042 --> 46:48.042
As I see it, there is one option
still open to us.

46:49.602 --> 46:50.851
Gettrick's house.

46:50.852 --> 46:53.852
No. If he's as dangerous
as you say he is...

46:54.322 --> 46:56.881
If I am right, he knows I have
seen him for who he is

46:56.882 --> 46:59.291
and he'll already be gone.

47:00.842 --> 47:03.842
Listen, that thing in your head?

47:04.092 --> 47:06.761
You can't run away from it, Julien.

47:06.762 --> 47:09.401
I know.

47:09.402 --> 47:10.601
OK.

49:34.082 --> 49:36.291
Are you sure you wish to do this?

49:36.292 --> 49:39.292
Well, I'm here, aren't I?

53:07.052 --> 53:10.052
Lucy. Lucy, wake up, darling.

53:10.742 --> 53:13.742
There you go.

53:14.123 --> 53:16.301
We'll find you something here,
won't we?

53:16.302 --> 53:19.302
Something to replace Mr Squibbles.

53:25.042 --> 53:28.042
What's wrong?
It's just I've...

53:28.302 --> 53:30.691
I must've left some cash at home.
But it's fine.

53:30.692 --> 53:33.692
It's fine. It doesn't matter.

53:36.932 --> 53:39.932
Look at him. He's nice, isn't he?

53:57.532 --> 54:00.532
Mummy! Lucy!

54:02.102 --> 54:05.102
I've missed you.

54:10.482 --> 54:13.482
It's amazing. Us all here together.

54:27.482 --> 54:29.481
It was worth it, wasn't it?

54:29.482 --> 54:32.091
Every second.

54:32.092 --> 54:35.092
Come on. You need to help me
with everything in the car.

55:12.652 --> 55:15.571
What is it?

55:15.572 --> 55:18.572
Look at that.

55:19.492 --> 55:22.492
Will you help me
move these boxes, Mrs Webster?

55:47.812 --> 55:49.611
Right.

55:49.612 --> 55:52.612
That's the last of it.

55:54.812 --> 55:57.101
Feels good, doesn't it?

55:57.102 --> 56:00.102
The air here... Shh.

56:01.182 --> 56:03.491
She must be tired
from the long journey.

56:03.492 --> 56:06.492
What's in the bag?

56:15.774 --> 56:18.163
She'll love it.

56:18.164 --> 56:21.164
No, it's not for her.

56:27.164 --> 56:30.124
She used to talk about one of these.
Remember?

56:30.125 --> 56:33.125
The one her brother used to keep
trying to steal from her.

56:34.834 --> 56:37.374
Back in the day.

56:37.375 --> 56:40.375
Back when she behaved.

56:41.245 --> 56:43.733
She was very good in the car,
though.

56:43.734 --> 56:46.633
I didn't hear a sound from the boot
the entire journey.

56:46.634 --> 56:49.634
So I thought I'd give her
a present...

56:49.804 --> 56:52.804
for being such a good girl.

56:58.375 --> 57:00.803
You can have this...

57:00.804 --> 57:03.804
if you're good.

57:10.274 --> 57:13.274
Stay.

57:15.534 --> 57:18.173
You will be good,

57:18.174 --> 57:21.174
won't you, Alice?

57:21.924 --> 57:22.924
I'll be good.
