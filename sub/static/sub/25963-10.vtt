Let me ask you, okay?
All right?

22:22.689 --> 22:27.171
Just suppose this Cerebellin
drug lobotomizes him in a way

22:27.215 --> 22:30.000

is no more.

22:30.044 --> 22:31.437
Yeah, but I don't believe
that to be the case.

Let's just suppose it is.

22:33.526 --> 22:37.007
So the old Brady is no more
and the new one

22:37.051 --> 22:41.751
bears no real psychological
or culpable-intent resemblance.

22:41.795 --> 22:43.884
So what you're suggesting
is that I go

22:43.927 --> 22:45.973
and I murder
a load of people

22:46.016 --> 22:48.410

filled out and we call it a day.

22:48.454 --> 22:49.846

what this is.

is a law-abiding, sane one.

Reporter Smith: We can confirm
that Brady Hartsfield

51:55.024 --> 51:58.506
was pronounced dead at 3:06
p.m. by the county coroner.

51:58.550 --> 52:01.683
Cause of death was a single

52:01.727 --> 52:03.772
And what we're learning,

is that the weapon that was

was, in fact, a 3-D-printable
gun that she made herself.

was ceramic,
