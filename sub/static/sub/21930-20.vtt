WEBVTT

00:01.871 --> 00:04.322
If Bruce Banner's driving
a rental car

00:04.323 --> 00:07.157
and turns into the Hulk,
do you think he's covered,

00:07.159 --> 00:11.829
or does he need to add the Hulk
as an additional driver?

00:11.831 --> 00:14.431
You really need
a girlfriend.

00:15.768 --> 00:19.036
Mailman's here!

00:19.038 --> 00:23.207
Aw. Remember when he used to
get that excited to see us?

00:23.209 --> 00:25.342
Do you have any mail
for Dr. Sheldon Cooper?

00:25.344 --> 00:27.645
I do, but I can't hand it
right to you...

00:27.647 --> 00:29.480
I have to put it in the box.

00:29.482 --> 00:31.949
And that is what separates
the U.S. Postal Service

00:31.951 --> 00:34.285
from those hippies at FedEx.

00:35.955 --> 00:37.321
Oh, goody!

00:38.958 --> 00:40.658
What is so exciting?

00:40.660 --> 00:42.426
It's a letter from Dr. Wolcott.

00:42.428 --> 00:45.396
We've been corresponding
about my string theory research.

00:45.398 --> 00:49.466
Wait. Robert Wolcott?
Like Wolcott's Theorem Wolcott?

00:49.468 --> 00:50.934
The very same.

00:50.936 --> 00:52.169
Didn't he go crazy

00:52.171 --> 00:54.238
and cut off all
contact with people?

00:54.240 --> 00:56.774
Yeah, he was driven mad
by a friend

00:56.776 --> 01:01.111
who kept wanting to talk
about the Hulk's car insurance!

01:01.113 --> 01:03.981
Oh. He's invited me to his cabin
for the weekend,

01:03.983 --> 01:06.317
to discuss
a breakthrough he's had.

01:06.319 --> 01:08.986
- His cabin?
- Yes. He lives off the grid,

01:08.988 --> 01:10.220
up in the mountains.

01:10.222 --> 01:12.222
So you're gonna go
to the middle of nowhere

01:12.224 --> 01:15.526
and spend the weekend with
a crazy man you've never met?

01:15.528 --> 01:17.394
Yes. Why?

01:18.397 --> 01:19.564
No reason. Have fun.

Hmm.

01:58.947 --> 02:01.247
Oh, nice one.

02:01.249 --> 02:04.050
Hey, Penny, that's what you
sound like when you read.

02:05.153 --> 02:07.286
- Hey!
- What?

02:07.288 --> 02:09.489
<i>He</i> said it.

02:09.491 --> 02:10.823
Sheldon, what are you doing?

02:10.824 --> 02:12.825
I am decoding
Dr. Wolcott's letter

02:12.827 --> 02:14.527
using this book as the key.

02:14.529 --> 02:17.063
Aren't conversations more fun
when they're in code?

02:17.065 --> 02:21.367
Yes. But I'm using a code
where "yes" means "no."

02:21.369 --> 02:22.735
Oh. I got it!

02:22.737 --> 02:24.837
He's given me directions
to his cabin.

02:24.839 --> 02:26.472
He seems a little paranoid.

02:26.474 --> 02:28.675
He is not paranoid.

02:29.778 --> 02:32.645
- What are you doing?
- Following his instructions.

02:39.621 --> 02:42.388
Leonard, you are not letting
Sheldon go alone this weekend.

02:42.390 --> 02:45.158
I am a grown man... I don't need
somebody to chaperone me.

02:45.160 --> 02:47.794
I just need him
to drop me off, pick me up,

02:47.796 --> 02:49.262
and pack me a sack lunch.

02:49.264 --> 02:50.797
Don't look at me.

02:50.799 --> 02:54.767
When the music stopped,
you were holding Sheldon.

02:54.769 --> 02:57.637
Amy can't take him... it's her
bachelorette party this weekend.

02:57.639 --> 02:58.638
Yes, it is...

02:58.640 --> 03:00.273
because I'm getting married!

03:00.275 --> 03:02.675
Are you gonna be doing that
all weekend?

03:02.677 --> 03:03.776
Yes. Do you know why?

03:03.778 --> 03:05.044
Because you're getting married!

03:06.114 --> 03:07.246
All right, Leonard,

03:07.248 --> 03:08.748
looks like you're driving me.

03:08.750 --> 03:11.184
But maybe you could drop me
at the bottom of the mountain.

03:11.186 --> 03:12.685
I want him to think I'm cool.

03:12.687 --> 03:15.822
That's great,
everyone's got weekend plans.

03:15.824 --> 03:17.290
Amy has her
bachelorette party,

03:17.292 --> 03:20.193
and Sheldon's gonna go
to the woods and get hunted for sport.

03:20.195 --> 03:22.295
Yeah, as someone
who has to track him every time

03:22.297 --> 03:25.698
he gets lost in IKEA, I feel
like I'd be really good at that.

03:25.700 --> 03:27.133
Leonard, you
cannot drop him off.

03:27.135 --> 03:29.469
You have to stay with him
and keep him safe.

03:29.471 --> 03:31.098
Howard, you have to go
and keep Leonard safe.

03:31.122 --> 03:32.206
Fine.

03:32.207 --> 03:35.374
I get it-- and you want me
to go and keep Howard safe.

03:35.376 --> 03:37.643
- Actually, I...
- Uh, just say yes, or he's gonna want

03:37.645 --> 03:39.378
to come to the
bachelorette party.

03:41.983 --> 03:44.383
Are you sure you're
gonna be okay this weekend?

03:44.385 --> 03:45.785
Of course.

03:45.787 --> 03:47.754
No, I'm much more concerned
about you.

03:47.756 --> 03:51.257
I know how you gals behave
when the men are away.

03:51.259 --> 03:53.192
You do?

03:53.194 --> 03:55.695
I've read <i>The Bacchae</i>
by Euripides.

03:55.697 --> 03:58.831
Drinking wine,
riding panthers...

03:59.934 --> 04:04.070
Proof that girls have gone wild
for over 2,500 years.

04:04.072 --> 04:06.706
Well, I wish I could say
none of that is gonna happen,

04:06.708 --> 04:08.908
but Penny is planning it,
and she is the reason

04:08.910 --> 04:11.778
I own those underwear
with writing across the butt.

04:12.781 --> 04:15.448
Well, just be careful,

04:15.450 --> 04:17.250
and use protection.

04:17.252 --> 04:20.519
What do you think
is gonna happen?

04:20.522 --> 04:22.789
I don't know.
But it's going to be sunny,

04:22.791 --> 04:25.224
and you burn easily.

04:25.226 --> 04:26.592
It'll be fine.

04:26.594 --> 04:28.795
I'm sure there'll be
some drinking and some dancing,

04:28.797 --> 04:31.097
and then a mailman'll
probably show up

04:31.099 --> 04:32.231
and take his clothes off...

04:32.233 --> 04:35.101
Nicholas is going to
take his clothes off?

04:35.103 --> 04:37.904
No, not <i>our</i> mailman.

04:37.906 --> 04:39.839
A dancer pretending
to be a mailman.

04:39.841 --> 04:42.008
Impersonating a
federal employee?

04:42.010 --> 04:44.544
Oh, where's the
after-party, prison?

04:46.414 --> 04:48.681
It's sweet that
you're worried about me.

04:48.683 --> 04:50.950
Well, of course
I'm worried about you--

04:50.952 --> 04:52.318
I want you to be safe.

04:52.320 --> 04:53.753
And I want you to be safe.

04:53.755 --> 04:55.855
I will be. I'll have
my friends with me.

04:55.857 --> 04:59.258
If anything should go wrong,
I can use them as human shields.

05:02.564 --> 05:04.730
For most of human history,

05:04.732 --> 05:08.701
time was believed to be
an objective part of reality.

05:08.703 --> 05:12.939
But with the contributions
of Immanuel Kant,

05:12.941 --> 05:14.473
science and philosophy...

05:14.475 --> 05:17.510
When I said you should make
a playlist for the road trip,

05:17.512 --> 05:19.979
I meant music.

05:21.516 --> 05:23.015
This is better than music--

05:23.017 --> 05:25.451
this is a lecture
on nonlinear time.

05:25.453 --> 05:27.653
Sounds like it's
just on regular time.

05:27.655 --> 05:29.422
Yes. But I put it
on shuffle.

05:32.493 --> 05:33.759
This is nice.

05:33.761 --> 05:36.128
The four of us haven't
taken a trip like this

05:36.130 --> 05:37.730
since Leonard's
bachelor party.

05:37.732 --> 05:39.866
And now here we are
for Sheldon's.

05:39.868 --> 05:41.534
Yeah, uh,
Leonard...

05:41.536 --> 05:44.003
As Sheldon's best man,
I need to inform you

05:44.005 --> 05:46.372
that this is not
a bachelor party.

05:46.374 --> 05:48.140
And tell them why.
Because you're

05:48.142 --> 05:49.675
a tiresome scold.

05:50.945 --> 05:53.246
No. It's because
a bachelor party

05:53.248 --> 05:55.248
is typically
a hedonistic blowout

05:55.250 --> 05:57.516
where no pleasures
of the flesh are denied.

05:57.518 --> 05:58.951
I'm not interested in that.

05:58.953 --> 06:02.755
How is that not
exactly what I said?

06:05.593 --> 06:07.159
Okay, now, I promised Sheldon

06:07.161 --> 06:09.228
things weren't gonna get
too crazy tonight.

06:09.230 --> 06:10.596
Should I be worried?

06:10.598 --> 06:13.332
Oh, just about who
you're marrying.

06:16.738 --> 06:18.671
Just come on.

06:18.673 --> 06:21.774
Welcome to
your...

06:21.776 --> 06:24.443
bachelorette
party!

06:28.149 --> 06:30.349
Oh...

06:32.086 --> 06:33.419
It's a quilting bee!

06:33.421 --> 06:36.088
My bachelorette party's
a quilting bee!

06:36.090 --> 06:37.356
Isn't it perfect?

06:37.358 --> 06:40.026
Yeah, instead of oiled-up
strippers and sex toys,

06:40.028 --> 06:43.329
we thought: what
does Amy like?

06:45.633 --> 06:47.900
Amy likes the quilting bee!

06:50.838 --> 06:53.439
Well, this place
is creepy.

06:53.441 --> 06:54.674
Why?

06:54.676 --> 06:57.143
Well, did you see
his vegetable garden?

06:57.145 --> 06:59.211
Heirloom tomatoes in April.

06:59.213 --> 07:01.414
Creepy.

07:01.416 --> 07:02.748
Okay, listen.

07:02.750 --> 07:05.518
Dr. Wolcott is
a brilliant topologist.

07:05.520 --> 07:08.287
We need to set some ground rules
so that you don't embarrass me.

07:08.289 --> 07:10.523
No magic.
No whining.

07:10.525 --> 07:12.091
You-- just no.

07:12.860 --> 07:14.160
Hey...

07:14.162 --> 07:17.663
Uh, how come
he gets to whine?

07:18.499 --> 07:19.966
Dr. Wolcott?

07:19.968 --> 07:22.802
Dr. Wolcott? Dr. Wolcott?

07:29.877 --> 07:31.444
That's a lot of locks.

07:31.446 --> 07:35.581
Mm. That was a lot of knocks--
they were made for each other.

07:38.186 --> 07:40.353
- Dr. Wolcott.
-Dr. Cooper.

07:40.355 --> 07:42.855
Uh, who are these people?

07:42.857 --> 07:45.458
Oh, these are my friends.
I wrote about them in my letter.

07:45.460 --> 07:47.960
Oh, letter?
I didn't get a letter.

07:47.962 --> 07:50.229
Well, that's because I just
sent it this morning, you know?

07:50.231 --> 07:53.065
So score one for linear time.

07:53.067 --> 07:56.802
Well, um, I don't normally
allow strangers into my house.

07:56.804 --> 08:00.973
But when you do, you-you
let them out, right?

08:00.975 --> 08:03.642
Dr. Cooper, if you
can promise me

08:03.644 --> 08:05.144
these men share
your intellect

08:05.146 --> 08:09.548
and academic rigor, yeah,
I suppose they can join us.

08:10.451 --> 08:13.152
You guys might need
to wait in the car.

08:17.096 --> 08:18.662
Well, let me
show you around.

08:18.664 --> 08:21.565
This is the chair where
I do most of my thinking,

08:21.567 --> 08:23.133
my thinking about work.

08:23.135 --> 08:26.303
Now, my thinking about people
who have <i>wronged</i> me,

08:26.305 --> 08:27.938
I do over there.

08:29.775 --> 08:32.109
I've always said that
<i>I</i> should get a grudge chair.

08:32.111 --> 08:33.251
Leonard, have I
not always said that?

08:33.275 --> 08:34.544
Mm, you have--

08:34.546 --> 08:36.544
but you were worried you'd
spend too much time in it.

08:36.568 --> 08:37.782
Yeah.

08:37.783 --> 08:40.917
That was a real concern.

08:40.919 --> 08:43.986
Oh, my God,
this tomato is amazing!

08:43.989 --> 08:46.723
I can eat it like an apple.

08:46.725 --> 08:51.261
My secret is I fertilize it
with my own manure.

08:56.468 --> 08:58.935
The look on your face.

09:00.539 --> 09:04.341
It's a sort of grin.
You want to know what kind?

09:07.779 --> 09:09.613
So, Dr. Wolcott,

09:09.615 --> 09:12.349
in your letter, you said you had
a new mathematical approach

09:12.351 --> 09:15.452
that would help me conceptualize
the dimensions in string theory?

09:15.454 --> 09:18.722
Uh, yes, yes, yes, yes.
But before we get started,

09:18.724 --> 09:22.259
I am going to need to collect
everybody's phone. Yeah.

09:22.261 --> 09:24.294
- Oh.
- Why?

09:24.296 --> 09:26.630
Because they're little
listening devices, aren't they?

09:26.632 --> 09:30.567
Yes, for people to spy on you
and steal your work.

09:30.569 --> 09:32.235
Yeah, what happened
to the good old days

09:32.237 --> 09:34.004
where if someone wanted
to steal your work,

09:34.006 --> 09:37.607
they had to hire a
prostitute to seduce you?

09:37.609 --> 09:40.076
Who told you about that?

09:40.913 --> 09:42.946
Just making a joke.

09:42.948 --> 09:45.649
Yeah, it's not funny
when it happens.

09:45.651 --> 09:47.450
All right, now,

09:47.452 --> 09:51.788
you're probably going to want to
start with this notebook here.

09:51.790 --> 09:54.558
- Oh. Oh, my.
- Here we are.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.059
Oh...

09:56.061 --> 09:57.794
Um...

09:57.796 --> 10:01.298
no offense, Dr. Wolcott, but I'm
not sure this makes any sense.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.400
That's because I've
written it all backwards.

10:03.402 --> 10:05.468
You... Wow.

10:06.305 --> 10:08.972
That's "wow" backwards.

10:09.808 --> 10:11.274
Hmm. You know...

10:11.276 --> 10:13.191
I still don't get it.

10:13.215 --> 10:14.312
Well, plus the numbers
are letters

10:14.313 --> 10:15.657
and the letters are numbers.

10:15.681 --> 10:17.114
Oh.

10:17.115 --> 10:19.616
I love him.

10:21.000 --> 10:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:30.996 --> 10:33.730
Are you having fun?

10:33.732 --> 10:35.498
Yeah.

10:35.500 --> 10:39.369
I just, uh, finished sewing this
top to bottom.

10:39.371 --> 10:43.006
Now I'm gonna sew it
side to side.

10:43.008 --> 10:44.474
Pace yourself.

10:45.544 --> 10:46.576
Some more tea?

10:46.578 --> 10:48.645
Oh, lovely.

10:53.986 --> 10:54.951
Oh.

10:56.688 --> 10:58.922
Seriously? What the hell?

10:58.924 --> 11:00.457
- Huh?
- What?

11:00.459 --> 11:02.359
This is my bachelorette party,

11:02.361 --> 11:04.494
tea and quilts?
Well, you said

11:04.496 --> 11:06.630
you didn't want anything crazy.
- Yes,

11:06.632 --> 11:08.698
but I said it like, "I
don't want anything crazy."

11:08.700 --> 11:11.701
Which clearly means
I wanted something crazy.

11:12.604 --> 11:14.904
I mean, is this how boring
you think I am?

11:14.906 --> 11:18.642
Penny, she asked
you a question.

11:19.411 --> 11:21.044
Of course not.

11:21.046 --> 11:23.213
So you thought that
I would like quilting?

11:23.215 --> 11:25.048
- Well, don't you?
- Of course I like quilting!

11:25.050 --> 11:27.651
It's the slowest way
to make a blanket!

11:28.820 --> 11:30.387
But this is
my bachelorette party!

11:30.389 --> 11:34.090
It's supposed to be fun and wild
and full of bad decisions.

11:34.092 --> 11:36.459
- Hey, we can make bad decisions.
- Yeah.

11:36.461 --> 11:38.795
She had two kids back-to-back
and I thought you'd like this,

11:38.797 --> 11:40.897
so we're off
to a good start.

11:42.267 --> 11:44.200
Come on, let's go somewhere
we can do body shots

11:44.202 --> 11:45.835
off shirtless bartenders.
Yes.

11:45.837 --> 11:48.138
I don't know.
That might be too much.

11:48.140 --> 11:50.073
All right, you know what,
why don't we stay home, have a little wine...

11:50.075 --> 11:52.409
What are you not
getting about this?!

11:55.080 --> 11:58.581
Dr. Wolcott, your work
on time is revolutionary.

11:58.583 --> 12:00.250
I would say
thank you,

12:00.252 --> 12:01.484
but, in my theory of time,

12:01.486 --> 12:03.119
you've already called my work
revolutionary,

12:03.121 --> 12:04.354
I've already thanked you,

12:04.356 --> 12:05.855
and I hate repeating myself,

12:05.857 --> 12:07.824
so let's move on.

12:09.261 --> 12:11.294
Wait a minute,
are-are you saying that time

12:11.296 --> 12:13.863
has multiple dimensions,
the same as space?

12:13.865 --> 12:15.565
No. No, I'm
not saying it--

12:15.567 --> 12:17.067
the math is
saying it.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.002
Though it is the math
that I invented,

12:19.004 --> 12:21.338
so, yes, I guess I am saying it.

12:22.240 --> 12:24.841
You understanding
any of this?

12:24.843 --> 12:29.612
I haven't understood
anything since poop tomato.

12:29.614 --> 12:31.147
My goodness,

12:31.149 --> 12:33.116
this is incredible.
See,

12:33.118 --> 12:35.251
I-I'm just not seeing
where string theory fits

12:35.253 --> 12:37.153
into all this, and that's
where I think that you and I

12:37.155 --> 12:38.621
could be of help to each other.

12:38.623 --> 12:40.190
Thank you. I'd be honored.

12:40.192 --> 12:43.126
All right. Allow me to show you
my most recent journal.

12:44.863 --> 12:46.996
Sheldon's right.

12:46.998 --> 12:49.165
This guy, this guy's brilliant.

12:49.167 --> 12:52.068
Yeah, I mean,
he's a little... kooky,

12:52.070 --> 12:54.237
but a mind
that can reconceptualize time

12:54.239 --> 12:55.905
probably has a reason
for keeping a jar

12:55.907 --> 12:58.375
of toenail clippings
that we just don't understand.

12:59.745 --> 13:02.645
I could spend months up here
just going through his math.

13:02.647 --> 13:03.780
I think Sheldon might.

13:03.782 --> 13:05.982
Great. Who's
gonna tell Amy

13:05.984 --> 13:09.319
we lost her fiancé
to a madman in the mountains?

13:10.722 --> 13:12.822
Hey, I drove.

13:15.560 --> 13:17.093
This is so exciting.

13:17.095 --> 13:18.461
Can we do a body shot?

13:18.463 --> 13:20.330
I've always wanted
to do a body shot.

13:20.332 --> 13:22.932
Also, what's a body shot?

13:22.934 --> 13:25.329
It's when you take a drink out
of a stranger's belly button.

13:25.353 --> 13:25.970
Ew.

13:25.971 --> 13:26.970
No, thanks.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.304
What if they have an outie?

13:28.306 --> 13:30.340
Does it just spill everywhere?

13:30.342 --> 13:32.375
Okay, look,
we've got all night.

13:32.377 --> 13:34.077
Let's just take it easy.
We can...

13:34.079 --> 13:35.378
I'm getting married!

13:37.716 --> 13:39.649
Here you go. First round
is on the house.

13:39.651 --> 13:41.217
- Ooh.
- Hey there.

13:41.219 --> 13:42.685
Do you do body shots?

13:42.687 --> 13:44.320
Oh, she said she
didn't want one.

13:44.322 --> 13:45.722
Mind your business.

13:45.724 --> 13:47.223
Cheers!

13:52.364 --> 13:54.364
Amy?

13:54.366 --> 13:56.533
Amy? Should we get her home?

13:56.535 --> 13:59.869
Why? She's sound asleep,
and we have sliders coming.

13:59.871 --> 14:01.871
One more round!

14:03.041 --> 14:05.041
So, how would this work

14:05.043 --> 14:06.810
in the context of
a singularity?

14:06.812 --> 14:09.312
Yes, that's-that's
a tricky bit to explain.

14:09.314 --> 14:12.248
I assume you're familiar
with non-abelian group theory.

14:12.250 --> 14:13.349
Oh, and how.

14:13.351 --> 14:15.251
You never forget your
first group theory.

14:15.253 --> 14:17.620
Listen, I'm gonna put on
a pot of coffee,

14:17.622 --> 14:19.789
because there is a lot
of math to go through.

14:19.791 --> 14:22.325
And he said he didn't want
a wild bachelor party.

14:22.327 --> 14:23.827
Excuse me?

14:23.829 --> 14:25.762
Oh, uh, Sheldon's
getting married in a month.

14:25.764 --> 14:26.863
Oh!

14:26.865 --> 14:28.398
Congratulations.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.967
Yeah, I'm a
married man myself.

14:30.969 --> 14:31.968
Oh, really?
Is she here?

14:31.970 --> 14:34.270
And alive?

14:35.140 --> 14:38.942
A-And can people other than you
see her?

14:40.645 --> 14:41.744
She lives in Munich.

14:41.746 --> 14:42.745
It's a perfect marriage.

14:42.747 --> 14:44.347
We focus
on our work

14:44.349 --> 14:46.883
and send each other cards
every year on our birthdays.

14:46.885 --> 14:49.486
Hey, wait,
what-what month is it?

14:49.488 --> 14:50.453
Uh, April.

14:50.455 --> 14:51.788
Most years.

14:51.790 --> 14:52.989
The point is

14:52.991 --> 14:54.190
we give each other space.

14:54.192 --> 14:56.593
I give her Europe,
she gives me South America.

14:56.595 --> 14:59.496
That's where she thinks
I'm living.

15:00.599 --> 15:04.434
I-I've never considered
a long-distance marriage.

15:04.436 --> 15:06.202
Well, listen, if you want
to be a great scientist,

15:06.204 --> 15:08.004
you can't afford
to be distracted.

15:08.006 --> 15:10.607
Hey, where are
my manners?

15:10.609 --> 15:12.375
You fellas
must be hungry.

15:12.377 --> 15:13.710
Do you like rabbit?

15:13.712 --> 15:15.311
- Yeah. - Sure.
- Sounds good.

15:15.313 --> 15:16.946
Okay.

15:16.948 --> 15:21.384
But can you tell the difference
between rabbit and squirrel?

15:21.386 --> 15:22.652
- No. - Don't think so.
- Probably not.

15:22.654 --> 15:24.988
Great!

15:24.990 --> 15:27.624
We're having rabbit.

15:29.461 --> 15:31.361
Be right back!

15:33.131 --> 15:35.999
It is amazing
how much he's accomplished

15:36.001 --> 15:39.802
by isolating himself from the
distractions of day-to-day life.

15:39.804 --> 15:42.372
Okay, please don't tell me
you want to live like this.

15:42.374 --> 15:44.574
See, that's
the strange thing.

15:44.576 --> 15:45.975
I don't.

15:45.977 --> 15:48.011
What is wrong with me?

15:48.013 --> 15:50.280
Why don't I want this?

15:50.282 --> 15:52.448
Look at how cool
it all is.

15:52.450 --> 15:55.585
Nothing is wrong with
you. You have friends,

15:55.587 --> 15:58.454
you have a fiancée,
you have a full life.

15:59.291 --> 16:01.891
You know what,

16:01.893 --> 16:03.660
you're right.

16:03.662 --> 16:07.697
Thank you
for bringing me up here.

16:07.699 --> 16:10.133
But I think
I'm ready to go home now.

16:10.135 --> 16:11.501
Really? You don't want
to stay for dinner

16:11.503 --> 16:12.869
and talk more science?

16:12.871 --> 16:14.203
No. No, we better go.

16:14.205 --> 16:15.805
I miss Amy.

16:15.807 --> 16:18.341
And my phone.

16:22.213 --> 16:24.547
Also, I'm from Texas,

16:24.549 --> 16:28.017
and I <i>can</i> taste the difference
between rabbit and squirrel.

16:35.794 --> 16:37.927
Oh, look who's back!

16:37.929 --> 16:39.596
There she is!

16:39.598 --> 16:42.432
What happened?
How did we get here?

16:42.434 --> 16:43.666
You don't remember anything?

16:43.668 --> 16:46.803
I remember taking some shots,
and then...

16:46.805 --> 16:48.371
that's it.

16:49.174 --> 16:51.207
Oh, my gosh, did I pass out?

16:51.209 --> 16:52.508
You kind of did.

16:52.510 --> 16:53.876
At my own bachelorette party?

16:53.878 --> 16:55.545
I'm so lame.

16:56.514 --> 16:58.781
Well, you didn't pass out
before you did

16:58.783 --> 17:00.383
all kinds of fun stuff.

17:00.385 --> 17:01.284
What did I do?

17:01.286 --> 17:03.953
What did you <i>do?</i>

17:03.955 --> 17:06.689
What'd she do?

17:06.691 --> 17:09.058
Um...

17:09.060 --> 17:12.862
well, you don't remember
Riverdancing on top of the bar?

17:17.469 --> 17:18.968
I did that?

17:18.970 --> 17:20.002
Yeah, you did!

17:20.005 --> 17:21.938
Mm-hmm.

17:21.940 --> 17:24.674
But I don't know how
to Riverdance.

17:24.675 --> 17:28.411
Didn't stop you from teaching
all those shirtless firemen.

17:29.914 --> 17:32.482
I saw shirtless firemen?

17:32.484 --> 17:35.652
Saw, smelled,
slid down like a pole.

17:36.488 --> 17:38.588
Did I flash anybody?

17:38.590 --> 17:41.324
How about <i>everybody?</i>

17:42.327 --> 17:44.394
I can't believe it.
I'm so embarrassed.

17:44.396 --> 17:47.463
You didn't take any pictures,
did you?

17:47.465 --> 17:49.032
Oh, no, we would
never do that to you.

17:49.034 --> 17:50.299
Yeah. But if there
were pictures,

17:50.301 --> 17:53.569
they would be <i>crazy.</i>

17:53.571 --> 17:56.139
- You guys are good friends.
- Mm.

18:08.053 --> 18:10.987
Dinner!

18:11.823 --> 18:14.023
Guys?

18:15.960 --> 18:19.228
I can't believe they left
without saying good-bye.

18:19.230 --> 18:22.465
Wait a minute,
what if they stole my work?

18:22.467 --> 18:25.134
Wait a minute!

18:25.136 --> 18:27.503
What if they were never here
at all?

18:27.505 --> 18:29.072
Wait a minute!

18:29.074 --> 18:31.107
What if they haven't
gotten here yet

18:31.109 --> 18:33.910
but they're on their way?!

18:33.912 --> 18:36.379
I better tidy up.

18:45.552 --> 18:46.943
Hello.

18:46.944 --> 18:48.810
Welcome back. How'd it go?

18:48.812 --> 18:51.780
Well, Dr. Wolcott's theories
of time

18:51.782 --> 18:55.117
might save my new interpretation
of string theory.

18:55.119 --> 18:56.618
Oh, well, that's exciting.

18:56.620 --> 18:58.053
It is.

18:58.055 --> 19:00.055
How was your
bachelorette party?

19:00.057 --> 19:02.824
Well, I was in a bar,

19:02.826 --> 19:05.927
and I saw
some shirtless men.

19:05.929 --> 19:08.930
They were firemen,
and they fought over me.

19:10.234 --> 19:11.833
But Penny and Bernadette
got me out of there

19:11.835 --> 19:14.870
before the victor got my spoils.

19:16.206 --> 19:18.707
I see.

19:18.709 --> 19:20.142
What's the matter?

19:20.144 --> 19:22.444
You look glum.

19:22.446 --> 19:25.447
Amy, would you
still love me

19:25.449 --> 19:27.849
if I wasn't who
you thought I was?

19:27.851 --> 19:29.851
What are you talking about?

19:29.853 --> 19:32.187
Well, what if it turns out

19:32.189 --> 19:36.258
I'm not the single-minded,
science-obsessed recluse

19:36.260 --> 19:39.194
who puts his work above
everything and everybody else

19:39.196 --> 19:40.662
that you fell in love with?

19:44.268 --> 19:46.535
What if I'm not
the straightlaced,

19:46.537 --> 19:49.237
buttoned-up, quilting queen
you thought I was?

19:50.140 --> 19:52.441
What if I'm a...

19:52.443 --> 19:55.911
Riverdancing wild woman?

20:01.385 --> 20:03.251
I'd still love you.

20:03.253 --> 20:05.487
I'd still love you, too.

20:06.924 --> 20:10.859
Do you really know
how to Riverdance?

20:16.500 --> 20:18.033
You tell me.

20:29.613 --> 20:32.481
I'm the only man
you do that for.
