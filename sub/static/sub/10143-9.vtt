00:56.530 --> 00:58.673
<i>Any doubts</i>

00:58.698 --> 01:01.263
<i>General Akmal Ramiz</i>
<i>to run for President of</i>

01:01.264 --> 01:04.159
<i>Pakistan were apparently</i>

01:04.339 --> 01:07.475
<i>He announced in Islamabad that</i>

<i>We are the servants of the</i>

01:19.623 --> 01:21.891
<i>That is why I</i>
<i>have made this decision.</i>

01:21.926 --> 01:23.632
<i>General</i>
<i>Ramiz's announcement is</i>

01:23.633 --> 01:25.867
<i>expected to be welcomed</i>
<i>by many of the western</i>

01:28.933 --> 01:32.235
<i>The stability of Pakistan,</i>
<i>which has nuclear weapons,</i>

01:32.270 --> 01:34.204
<i>is high on the</i>
<i>summit's agenda.</i>

01:34.238 --> 01:37.297
<i>General Ramiz is not going to</i>
<i>the summit, but he had this</i>

01:37.322 --> 01:39.438
<i>message for the delegates </i>
<i>there...</i>

01:39.678 --> 01:42.613
<i>Pakistan must</i>

01:42.647 --> 01:45.583
<i>Pakistan must be a</i>
<i>prosperous nation.</i>

01:45.617 --> 01:48.820
<i>But Pakistan must also</i>
<i>be a peaceful nation.</i>

01:48.854 --> 01:52.290
<i>We will be watching events in</i>
<i>Budapest with great interest.</i>

01:52.324 --> 01:54.291
<i>I would like to reassure</i>

01:54.359 --> 01:57.195

Oh, fuck...

Did you get room service?

Check that.

Call the Colonel.

Need a location

04:29.346 --> 04:32.048
Yeah?

04:32.083 --> 04:34.084
I've been trying
to reach you.

04:35.653 --> 04:38.856
I just, um, I just...

04:44.662 --> 04:46.395
Never mind.

04:46.429 --> 04:47.484
What? You come
here to show me a file?

04:47.509 --> 04:48.709
No, no. I, um...

04:50.833 --> 04:52.700
Just make sure
you're contactable.

04:52.734 --> 04:54.802
All right? You're
still on duty.

04:58.239 --> 04:59.572
Grant...

04:59.607 --> 05:02.342
<i>We've</i>

05:16.890 --> 05:18.091
So...

05:18.125 --> 05:20.894
That's cheeky.

05:22.830 --> 05:26.065
Attacking your enemy's
when his defenses are down.

05:28.469 --> 05:31.171
We could have
this every day.

05:31.205 --> 05:34.374
I know, um...

05:34.408 --> 05:37.243
Section 20's no
place for a father.

05:46.722 --> 05:48.556
This isn't a joke, Michael.

05:48.591 --> 05:51.126
Oh, for fuck's sake.

05:53.730 --> 05:55.664
Don't pick that up.

06:04.407 --> 06:06.508
I have to.

06:07.677 --> 06:09.645
Stonebridge.

06:10.780 --> 06:13.382
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.
Yeah, I'll be there.

06:21.091 --> 06:23.626
You have to
choose, Michael.

06:25.696 --> 06:29.365
It's Them...or us.

06:39.476 --> 06:41.978
We'll talk about
this when I get back.

06:44.482 --> 06:46.232
We've recovered the
communications log on

06:46.257 --> 06:47.607
John Allen's PDA.

06:47.652 --> 06:50.353
- What did we get?
- Not as much as we hoped.

06:50.388 --> 06:52.523
Certainly not whatever he
was passing on to Latif.

06:52.557 --> 06:54.691
But we do know
they were communicating.

06:54.725 --> 06:56.590
So, we checked the
IP signatures on every email

06:56.615 --> 06:57.866
sent and received.

06:58.296 --> 06:59.930
And most of
them are clean...

06:59.964 --> 07:02.800
All except this one...

07:02.834 --> 07:04.978
Which as you can see
has been bounced more than

07:05.003 --> 07:06.203
a Greek government check...

07:06.872 --> 07:08.907
But it originated here...

07:08.941 --> 07:10.988
Southern Russia, in
a remote part of the

07:11.013 --> 07:12.256
province of Chechnya.

07:12.312 --> 07:16.148
Near the home town of
this woman. Dr Irina Mullova.

07:16.182 --> 07:18.651
She's a surgeon by
profession, and an Islamic

07:18.676 --> 07:19.752
Chechen separatist.

07:19.753 --> 07:21.483
Wasn't she after
your organ, Mike?

07:21.508 --> 07:22.621
Right.

07:22.622 --> 07:25.757
And according to Stonebridge,
Mullova and Latif left Kosovo together.

07:25.791 --> 07:28.426
So, we have to assume Latif
is at that location with her.

07:28.460 --> 07:30.194
This...

07:30.228 --> 07:31.697
Is our geo-stationary
satellite image of the exact

07:31.722 --> 07:33.157
location of the IP address.

07:33.765 --> 07:35.732
Great. It's another
road in another forest.

07:35.766 --> 07:36.960
Well, that's what we thought.

07:36.985 --> 07:39.087
But this is an image we
recorded before dawn.

07:45.377 --> 07:47.944
So, where are they
going? What is that?

07:47.979 --> 07:49.846
Go to thermal imaging...

07:53.084 --> 07:55.719
There's a
bunker under the trees.

08:00.325 --> 08:03.067
Your target is the
bunker 25 clicks north of

08:03.092 --> 08:04.194
the Georgian border.

08:04.195 --> 08:07.398
Where we believe
Latif is located.

08:07.432 --> 08:09.800
You're going in with
Georgian Special Forces.

08:12.971 --> 08:16.894
Be aware you are entering
hostile territory controlled

08:16.919 --> 08:18.539
by the Chechen guerilla army.

08:20.378 --> 08:22.280
Since our surveillance
started, eight people have

08:22.305 --> 08:23.505
entered this building.

08:23.649 --> 08:27.118
None of those eight have left.

08:27.152 --> 08:30.141
Whatever and whoever
you find inside, I want

08:30.166 --> 08:31.903
recovered or killed.

08:32.124 --> 08:33.691
Copy that.

08:40.365 --> 08:42.166
Move!
Go!

08:55.382 --> 08:57.831
Colonel, this
mission is an incursion into

08:57.856 --> 08:59.606
Russian sovereign territory...

08:59.653 --> 09:02.587
- I am aware of that.
- It is my duty to remind you.

09:02.622 --> 09:05.393
If this goes wrong, we
could be committing what

09:05.418 --> 09:06.770
amounts to an act of war!

09:10.464 --> 09:13.564
An act of war by Latif
is precisely what I'm

09:13.589 --> 09:14.789
trying to stop.

09:19.072 --> 09:21.177
Zero this
is Alpha 1. In position.

09:21.202 --> 09:22.602
Visual on target.

09:22.842 --> 09:24.476
<i>Copy that.</i>

09:51.135 --> 09:53.236
Standby, standby.

09:56.140 --> 09:58.141
Grenade!

10:00.311 --> 10:02.012
<i>Entering building.</i>

10:02.047 --> 10:03.681
Copy that.

10:09.623 --> 10:11.591
- Clear!

10:11.625 --> 10:13.993
Clear!

10:14.028 --> 10:16.263
Go left!

10:18.366 --> 10:20.267
<i>Zero, we</i>
<i>have stairs going down.</i>

10:20.302 --> 10:22.003
Copy that, understood.

10:23.305 --> 10:24.972
Go nuts.

10:29.044 --> 10:30.078
Clear left.

10:30.112 --> 10:32.179
Clear!

10:32.214 --> 10:35.916
Zero, this is Alpha 1, we
have what appears to be...

10:35.951 --> 10:38.785
Alpha 1, please repeat.

10:38.819 --> 10:40.054
Comm is difficult.

10:40.079 --> 10:42.169
We have what appears to be
a communications bunker.

10:44.225 --> 10:46.793
Alpha! Alpha!

10:46.827 --> 10:48.328
The building is clear!

10:48.362 --> 10:51.398
Shit.

10:51.432 --> 10:56.669
They're gone! Did
you hear that? They're gone.

10:58.371 --> 11:01.373
You're looking down
on this place, right?

11:01.408 --> 11:04.394
So, tell me how the
all-seeing eye doesn't

11:04.419 --> 11:05.961
see them running away...

11:09.583 --> 11:11.483
Sinclair?

11:11.518 --> 11:14.954
What the hell is
that? Oi, Scott, come here!

11:14.989 --> 11:17.557
Did you get that, Sinclair?
Oh, shit.

11:17.592 --> 11:19.059
- Hey!
- What?

11:19.093 --> 11:21.929
Give me a hand moving
this. Towards you, yeah?

11:21.963 --> 11:23.464
Go.

11:34.678 --> 11:37.580
Shit! Zero, this is Alpha 1,
we have another exit.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.682
What did he say?

11:39.716 --> 11:42.751
Not sure.
Alpha 1, please repeat.

11:42.785 --> 11:47.589
Going down!

11:52.460 --> 11:54.661
Booby trap! Go, go, go!

11:58.299 --> 12:00.467
Oh!

12:03.005 --> 12:07.141
Alpha 1, Alpha 2,
this is Zero, do you copy?

12:07.175 --> 12:11.112
Alpha 1, Alpha 2, this
is Zero, do you copy?

12:11.147 --> 12:13.982
- Find the Georgians.
- Over.

12:21.325 --> 12:24.761
Zero, this
is Alpha 2, copy.

12:24.795 --> 12:26.362
Door's jammed.
Ah, shit!

12:26.397 --> 12:28.237
Sinclair,
can you read me?

12:28.238 --> 12:29.120
There's nothing.

12:29.145 --> 12:30.645
I'm not picking anything
up on my comms...

12:32.603 --> 12:37.507
Guess we got no choice, pal.
Should we go that way?

12:37.542 --> 12:39.676
Colonel!

12:41.213 --> 12:43.226
This is the signal for
the Georgian commandos,

12:44.153 --> 12:45.253
it's flatlined.

12:45.283 --> 12:47.151
Their comms are
completely dead.

12:47.185 --> 12:49.519
This is Stonebridge and Scott...

12:49.544 --> 12:51.872
Now the signal's
weak, but it's still there.

12:52.790 --> 12:54.191
Keep trying.

12:54.225 --> 12:57.394
Go left. Left.

12:58.396 --> 13:00.197
Clear left.

13:01.766 --> 13:04.869
You ever wonder if there's
anyone not trying to kill us?

13:04.903 --> 13:07.104
Prefer not to
think about it.

13:07.138 --> 13:10.608
That's funny. I think
about it all the time.

13:10.642 --> 13:12.542
I know John certainly did.

13:12.577 --> 13:15.212
What are you talking about?

13:15.246 --> 13:18.882
Come on. You know.

13:18.916 --> 13:21.284
Going right.

13:25.089 --> 13:26.965
- Look,...
- What?

13:26.990 --> 13:28.990
we both know Porter
had his suspicions...

13:29.194 --> 13:31.963
He had his suspicions?
He fucking knew.

13:31.997 --> 13:34.700
- Gonna go through the door, now?
- Yeah, open the bloody door.

13:39.106 --> 13:42.308
Going down.

13:42.342 --> 13:43.744
I've worked
with these people for years.

13:43.769 --> 13:44.643
Yeah...

13:44.644 --> 13:49.181
- I've had to trust them.
- Why? Porter didn't.

13:49.215 --> 13:51.750
He worked it out,
and he got killed for it.

13:51.784 --> 13:55.653
John was given up
by Allen, remember?

13:56.655 --> 13:58.356
No, he wasn't.

13:58.390 --> 14:00.191
What
are you on about?

14:00.225 --> 14:02.624
Allen told me in
Kosovo, just before he died

14:03.530 --> 14:05.152
he had nothing to do with Porter.

14:05.163 --> 14:06.630
You believe him?

14:06.664 --> 14:09.933
In my experience, people don't
usually lie before they die.

14:09.967 --> 14:12.002
This place is one
big wine cellar?

14:12.036 --> 14:14.738
I'm willing to bet it
doesn't end in a gift shop.

14:15.674 --> 14:17.708
- Going left.
- Going right.

14:19.277 --> 14:22.479
Holy shit,
what is this place?

14:27.451 --> 14:31.288
- Major?
- What have you got?

14:31.322 --> 14:33.223
I went back to the
thermal image

14:33.257 --> 14:36.259
and found these dark spots in
the forest that just seem odd.

14:36.294 --> 14:38.495
- Can you enlarge?
- Mmm.

14:40.899 --> 14:44.102
What the fuck is that?

14:47.005 --> 14:49.973
All right, if
Allen didn't give up Porter...

14:50.008 --> 14:52.176
It doesn't mean
Section 20 did.

14:52.210 --> 14:55.280
You and I promised to watch each
others' back and we're still alive.

14:55.314 --> 14:57.349
That's gotta count to count
for something, right?

14:57.383 --> 15:02.220
Yeah. But it's not gonna
count for much longer, is it?

15:02.254 --> 15:06.057
What?
What are you getting at?

15:06.091 --> 15:09.660
Come on. You must've
had that talk with Kerry.

15:09.694 --> 15:11.528
What talk?

15:11.562 --> 15:13.896
Soldier versus
Daddy talk?

15:13.931 --> 15:16.232
How the hell do you
know about that?

15:16.266 --> 15:18.666
Oh, Come on. You think
you're the first solider

15:18.691 --> 15:19.868
to be in this predicament?

15:19.869 --> 15:22.071
All right. What
should I do?

15:22.105 --> 15:24.673
- You're seriously asking me?
- I'm seriously asking you.

15:24.708 --> 15:28.244
Oh, I'm seriously touched.

15:28.278 --> 15:31.847
In my opinion, though,
you're seriously fucked.

15:31.882 --> 15:34.288
You son of a bitch.

15:34.313 --> 15:35.452
God, you're such an asshole.

15:35.453 --> 15:38.588
Yeah, but
you love me.

15:56.340 --> 15:58.875
Leutnant Schekter.
Thank you for coming.

15:58.909 --> 16:01.777
Sorry I had to re-arrange.
Circumstances.

16:01.811 --> 16:06.982
Of course. And a certain penchant
for the dramatic, I think.

16:09.185 --> 16:12.188
I'd like to know why you slept
with Damien Scott again.

16:13.824 --> 16:17.326
I enjoyed it the first time,
so I went back for more.

16:18.995 --> 16:21.281
You were sent in to
make a psychological

16:21.306 --> 16:22.506
appraisal of my man.

16:22.565 --> 16:26.768
"My man."
Interesting expression.

16:26.802 --> 16:29.337
To consort with him outside of
these parameters is entirely...

16:29.371 --> 16:32.406
I fuck who I like.

16:32.441 --> 16:36.243
You know, maybe it's you
who needs an appraisal.

16:36.277 --> 16:38.078
Excuse me?

16:38.112 --> 16:40.680
I mean why, when you could so easily
have ordered someone else to do it...

16:40.714 --> 16:43.783
Did you knock on
his door yourself?

16:43.818 --> 16:46.849
But then, I don't think I
need a psychology degree

16:46.874 --> 16:48.203
to work that one out.

16:50.358 --> 16:52.159
Tell Damien I'll call him...

16:59.335 --> 17:01.536
Do you hear that?

17:01.571 --> 17:05.473
Sounds like a jenny
going right.

17:05.508 --> 17:08.377
Colonel, We've
found something...

17:08.411 --> 17:10.699
This dark patch in the forest,

17:10.723 --> 17:13.799
signifies cold air coming from
deep under the ground.

17:13.884 --> 17:17.319
The spot are at regular intervals,
approximately 30 meters apart.

17:17.354 --> 17:19.888
I think we're looking at
some kind of structure.

17:19.923 --> 17:21.457
Can we get a
computer projection?

17:21.492 --> 17:24.260
Oh, I'll see what I can do.
All right, thank you.

17:26.530 --> 17:28.998
Going left!

17:43.947 --> 17:45.548
Clear left.

17:48.919 --> 17:54.090
Want a pay raise?
Suitcase full of cash.

17:58.295 --> 18:00.663
Fuck me.

18:00.697 --> 18:05.201
Found a shitload
of blank passports.

18:05.235 --> 18:09.005
All right, buddy.
Moving away, go...

18:10.107 --> 18:12.308
Scott, door right.

18:20.316 --> 18:22.117
Go.

18:27.723 --> 18:29.657
Scott, look at this.

18:31.393 --> 18:33.928
Jackpot, it's a VX.

18:40.535 --> 18:42.268
Shit.

18:46.073 --> 18:48.341
What d'ya make
of this little guy?

18:48.376 --> 18:50.344
Looks like a bomb to me.

18:50.378 --> 18:52.012
It looks like a bomb to me.

18:54.181 --> 18:56.283
Think that's C4
in the middle?

18:58.687 --> 19:00.054
Could be.

19:00.088 --> 19:02.890
Major, Colonel. I
finished the projection.

19:11.334 --> 19:14.236
Oh my God.

19:14.271 --> 19:16.940
Must be at least
fifty kilometers of tunnel.

19:16.974 --> 19:19.951
That's gotta be some
kind of abandoned facility

19:19.976 --> 19:21.767
left over from the Soviet era.

19:21.945 --> 19:24.715
My guess is it was used
to house nuclear or

19:24.740 --> 19:26.299
chemical materials...

19:29.887 --> 19:32.689
I think I found a way out.

19:33.791 --> 19:36.626
Awesome, time to
play dress up.

19:36.661 --> 19:40.364
Good man. Cheers.
Black or green?

19:41.866 --> 19:45.136
Alpha 1, Alpha 2, this is
Zero, are you receiving?

19:49.074 --> 19:53.611
Alpha 1, Alpha 2, this is
Zero, are you receiving?

19:53.646 --> 19:56.147
Hey, sports fans,
we're back...

19:56.181 --> 19:57.375
Get a fix on comms.

19:57.400 --> 19:59.369
Alpha 1, this is Zero,
are you receiving?

19:59.785 --> 20:01.652
<i>Receiving loud and clear.</i>

20:01.687 --> 20:03.588
Can you give me a sit rep?

20:04.623 --> 20:07.025
Standby, clearing rooms.

20:11.597 --> 20:13.298
Shit.

20:25.778 --> 20:27.826
Zero, this is Alpha 1.

20:27.851 --> 20:29.593
We found some sort
of lab underground.

20:30.883 --> 20:33.485
Evidence of VX. And possible
means of dissemination.

20:33.519 --> 20:36.755
I'm uploading
photos right now.

20:36.789 --> 20:38.824
I think I liked it
better down there.

20:43.396 --> 20:44.730
Oh, shit.

20:44.764 --> 20:47.066
Confirm,
receiving uploads now.

20:51.271 --> 20:53.772
I need an LZ for
a chopper evac.

20:53.807 --> 20:55.807
Tell the Georgians
to standby.

20:55.842 --> 20:59.511
Location is 2.7 clicks north
east of target building.

20:59.545 --> 21:01.479
Satellite feed
coming online.

21:01.514 --> 21:04.816
Scott!

21:06.352 --> 21:08.553
Clear, go, go, go!

21:08.587 --> 21:11.289
Move left.

21:11.324 --> 21:12.991
Shit.

21:13.025 --> 21:14.795
Zero, we have two
vehicles leaving the site!

21:15.698 --> 21:16.898
Seven people on board.

21:16.996 --> 21:18.930
<i>Possibly one woman.</i>

21:18.964 --> 21:20.698
Is it Mullova?

21:20.732 --> 21:23.167
Cannot confirm.

21:23.201 --> 21:25.302
Tracking vehicles
heading north east.

21:25.336 --> 21:26.671
Understood.

21:26.696 --> 21:30.706
Colonel, the Georgians will not
wait, we must evacuate now.

21:32.043 --> 21:35.410
No, gentlemen, I need you
to find some transport.

21:35.435 --> 21:36.794
I want you in pursuit.

21:37.081 --> 21:41.284
Come on, mate.
In pursuit.

21:56.901 --> 21:58.369
Alpha 1 this is Zero.

21:58.403 --> 22:01.238
We've tracked the vehicles to
the town of Pentnagorsk,

22:01.272 --> 22:03.974
7 clicks north east
of your position.

22:04.008 --> 22:05.875
Roger that.

22:05.910 --> 22:07.510
Come on.
All right.

22:07.545 --> 22:09.179
You want me to push?
Shut up.

22:09.213 --> 22:11.914
Targets are
entering the building now.

22:11.949 --> 22:13.616
Have you secured
a vehicle yet?

22:13.650 --> 22:15.479
Woo-hoo!

22:15.504 --> 22:17.228
How about that?
Look at that.

22:57.460 --> 22:59.795
What is Latif doing
in that building?

22:59.829 --> 23:02.230
You don't know that he
is in that building.

23:04.200 --> 23:05.468
What we do know...

23:05.502 --> 23:07.769
Is that the Chechens are
poor, radicalized Muslims

23:07.804 --> 23:10.306
fighting a vicious
separatist war.

23:10.340 --> 23:12.482
If there's one thing this
place has plenty of,

23:12.507 --> 23:14.171
it's potential suicide bombers.

23:35.931 --> 23:38.565
He says he is proud
to offer himself

23:38.600 --> 23:41.835
as a true son of Chechnya in
the fight against the infidel.

23:55.817 --> 23:58.085
Hey, Scott, pull up
there. Those are the vehicles.

24:06.361 --> 24:10.397
Zero, this is Alpha 2. We're
at the target location now.

24:11.266 --> 24:13.300
<i>Sitrep?</i>

24:13.334 --> 24:14.694
There's two armed guards
on the door,

24:14.719 --> 24:16.661
unknown number of
men on the inside.

24:17.605 --> 24:20.007
The place is
crawling with civilians, you copy?

24:21.309 --> 24:22.510
Aslan?

24:36.725 --> 24:38.092
Alpha 1, Alpha 2,

24:38.126 --> 24:40.527
<i>are you in position</i>
<i>to engage?</i>

24:40.562 --> 24:41.629
Roger that.

24:41.663 --> 24:42.696
Stand by.

24:42.731 --> 24:43.731
Hold position.

24:43.765 --> 24:45.199
What do you think
you're doing?

24:45.233 --> 24:48.803
If this goes wrong, if
are civilians are killed,

24:48.837 --> 24:51.105
this could trigger a full-blown,
international shitstorm!

24:51.140 --> 24:53.208
You are not in the
field, Major.

24:53.242 --> 24:54.309
And you are not
listening!

24:54.343 --> 24:55.544
Colonel.

25:28.712 --> 25:30.378
<i>We all know</i>
<i>that Latif made a fool</i>

25:30.403 --> 25:31.806
<i>of this section in Delhi.</i>

25:33.351 --> 25:34.785
You cannot let that
cloud your judgment.

25:36.121 --> 25:37.488
The risks of launching
an assault...

25:37.522 --> 25:41.158
We are in the business
of risks, Major.

25:42.861 --> 25:45.997
Risks are what real
soldiers have to take.

25:49.368 --> 25:50.568
What the hell are
we waiting for?

25:50.602 --> 25:52.003
<i>Stand by.</i>

25:52.037 --> 25:53.104
<i>Awaiting orders.</i>

25:53.138 --> 25:54.505
- Oh, shit.
- There ya go.

25:56.908 --> 25:58.142
She likes you.

25:58.176 --> 25:59.410
You know I'd just
end up breaking her heart.

26:01.113 --> 26:02.446
I don't think I'm
cut out for marriage.

26:02.481 --> 26:04.415
How would you know
if you haven't tried?

26:04.450 --> 26:05.684
How do you know
I haven't?

26:08.922 --> 26:10.523
Yeah, no thanks,
sweetie.

26:10.557 --> 26:13.025
- No, thank you.
- Not interested, honey, you know?

26:13.059 --> 26:14.927
Hey, fuck off.

26:14.961 --> 26:16.528
You know? Fuck offski?

26:16.563 --> 26:17.730
Hey, hey, hey.

26:19.066 --> 26:20.666
Jesus Christ.

26:22.536 --> 26:24.570
That was smooth.

26:24.604 --> 26:26.272
I don't speak
prostitute, dude.

26:39.252 --> 26:41.840
Come on. We're sitting
around like a T-ball waiting

26:41.865 --> 26:43.214
for someone to take a swing.

26:43.823 --> 26:45.924
Even the chance,

26:45.958 --> 26:48.060
that Latif is in
that building,

26:48.094 --> 26:52.431
and in possession of VX, is
reason enough to engage.

26:52.465 --> 26:55.915
I will not retreat now, to
find out what Project Dawn

26:55.940 --> 26:57.660
is on the 10 o'clock news!

27:01.241 --> 27:03.342
Gentlemen, you may engage.

27:03.376 --> 27:04.577
Good.

27:08.015 --> 27:09.148
Contact! Contact!

27:13.653 --> 27:15.888
Scott! Scott, get in! Move!

27:17.858 --> 27:19.859
Find an LZ for
immediate evac.

27:32.106 --> 27:33.706
The Georgians are refusing
to come back in.

27:33.741 --> 27:35.809
I'll deal with them. You
help Scott and Stonebridge.

27:47.522 --> 27:48.623
Grenade! Move, move, move!

27:54.129 --> 27:55.864
Shit.

27:55.898 --> 27:58.047
We count multiple armed
hostiles in pursuit. I repeat,

27:58.072 --> 27:59.558
multiple armed hostiles.

27:59.635 --> 28:01.169
Keep moving, Scott!
Keep moving!

28:06.775 --> 28:08.575
Michael! Move, move!

28:10.845 --> 28:13.313
You get them out of there now, or
I will call every Russian news station

28:13.347 --> 28:15.281
and tell them exactly who took
us in, in the first place!

28:15.315 --> 28:16.515
Shit!

28:18.485 --> 28:19.518
Out, out!

28:19.553 --> 28:20.887
Covering!

28:20.921 --> 28:24.424
Alpha 1, Alpha 2,
confirm your position.

28:24.458 --> 28:25.959
Position is we're fucked!

28:27.061 --> 28:28.395
We're taking fire
from two sides.

28:30.064 --> 28:31.264
I'm out! Changing!

28:34.170 --> 28:35.803
Michael, there's a
door on our rear!

28:35.838 --> 28:37.038
Cover me!

28:37.940 --> 28:39.308
Move it, move it, move it!

28:45.081 --> 28:46.681
Move, Scott!

28:46.715 --> 28:47.715
Michael!

28:47.749 --> 28:48.816
Just move!

28:48.850 --> 28:50.884
Comin' to ya!

28:59.226 --> 29:00.994
No good, buddy! No good!

29:02.363 --> 29:03.697
Goddammit!

29:03.731 --> 29:04.898
On me! On me!

29:06.601 --> 29:07.802
Michael, move!

29:09.238 --> 29:10.438
Fuck!

29:12.241 --> 29:13.943
Hostiles approaching
east flank.

29:22.386 --> 29:23.552
Grenade!

29:25.022 --> 29:26.222
Motherfucker!

29:29.659 --> 29:32.328
I have three hostiles flanking
west side of building.

29:32.362 --> 29:33.629
- On it!
- Yeah!

29:38.302 --> 29:39.468
Shit.

29:42.305 --> 29:43.472
Grenade!

29:44.574 --> 29:45.775
Fuck you!

29:53.551 --> 29:55.085
Scott!
Yeah?

29:55.120 --> 29:56.220
On me!

29:56.254 --> 29:57.655
Comin' to ya!

29:59.124 --> 30:00.524
<i>Clear, west side.</i>

30:00.559 --> 30:01.759
Fuck me!

30:10.167 --> 30:11.335
Major?

30:11.369 --> 30:13.236
The Georgians are en
route, ETA five minutes.

30:13.271 --> 30:15.539
Which way?

30:15.573 --> 30:17.908
Forty-seven-ten north,
nineteen-three east.

30:17.942 --> 30:18.942
Shut up, Sinclair!

30:18.977 --> 30:20.344
<i>Which fucking way?</i>

30:20.378 --> 30:21.645
Straight ahead, turn
right, then left.

30:22.514 --> 30:24.448
Thank you!

30:24.482 --> 30:26.450
Michael, move, move!

30:30.054 --> 30:31.222
Changing!

30:32.391 --> 30:33.858
Move, move, move!

30:47.673 --> 30:48.873
Move, Scott!

30:50.309 --> 30:52.076
Move, move, move, move, move!

30:52.111 --> 30:53.278
Fuck!

31:02.354 --> 31:03.955
Jesus Christ!

31:03.989 --> 31:05.356
Out! Changing!

31:05.390 --> 31:07.157
Go, go, go!

31:08.626 --> 31:10.527
Where the fuck
is our evac?

31:10.562 --> 31:12.330
<i>Stand by on ETA.</i>

31:16.034 --> 31:19.103
I'm out! Sidearm!

31:19.137 --> 31:20.732
How many of these guys
do you think we can take

31:20.757 --> 31:21.957
before we're fucked?

31:22.340 --> 31:23.273
More than you!

31:23.308 --> 31:24.508
Fuck you!

31:25.776 --> 31:27.844
- Hey, Scott!
- Yeah?

31:27.878 --> 31:29.012
Were you really married?

31:30.347 --> 31:31.781
Are you fucking serious?

31:49.298 --> 31:51.267
<i>On board, go, go!</i>

31:52.435 --> 31:54.103
Yee-fuckin'-hah, buddy!

31:54.137 --> 31:55.271
Whoo-hoo!

31:55.306 --> 31:56.673
Yeehah!

31:56.707 --> 31:58.141
Okay. Thank you.

32:12.793 --> 32:14.428
May I?

32:14.462 --> 32:17.030
It's safe to handle.
The detonator's been disconnected.

32:17.065 --> 32:18.732
Okay, thank you.

32:18.767 --> 32:20.554
It's basically
a container for highly

32:20.579 --> 32:22.138
pressurized liquid VX.

32:23.071 --> 32:24.815
It's made almost entirely
of Pyrex,

32:24.840 --> 32:26.352
ceramic, and carbon fiber.

32:27.509 --> 32:30.477
The central explosive
core is a form of PETN,

32:30.512 --> 32:32.612
similar to what the shoe
bomber was carrying.

32:32.647 --> 32:37.251
It's powerful, hard to
detect, extremely volatile.

32:37.286 --> 32:39.286
Michael thought
he was carrying C4.

32:39.320 --> 32:42.723
I know. This is far less
stable than that.

32:42.757 --> 32:43.657
Don't drop it
then, Sinclair.

32:43.691 --> 32:45.826
If this had taken
a stray bullet...

32:45.860 --> 32:48.863
It's all right.
Stonebridge was carrying it.

32:48.897 --> 32:50.665
Even the best get lucky.

32:50.699 --> 32:51.766
Yeah, yeah.

32:51.800 --> 32:52.900
Scott.

32:52.935 --> 32:54.235
Yeah?

32:54.270 --> 32:55.803
I looked into Trojan Horse.

32:55.838 --> 32:57.672
Yeah?

32:57.706 --> 33:00.664
I couldn't find anything,
except Porter mentioned it in

33:00.689 --> 33:02.113
his last report from Lahore.

33:02.277 --> 33:04.178
Who else would have
seen that report?

33:05.914 --> 33:07.647
Aside from the colonel?

33:07.681 --> 33:10.137
...by siphoning off the
liquid gas and putting it

33:10.138 --> 33:11.151
in smaller canisters,

33:11.152 --> 33:12.218
that's what I'd do.

33:12.253 --> 33:14.254
Got it.

33:14.288 --> 33:15.522
Thanks.

33:15.556 --> 33:16.723
Gotta go.

33:17.959 --> 33:19.893
Now, how much damage
could it do?

33:19.928 --> 33:21.762
I've created a
projection.

33:21.796 --> 33:23.631
Worst case scenario.

33:23.665 --> 33:27.101
If this device were to go off,
as an uncontained blast,

33:27.135 --> 33:30.239
in perfect conditions,
no wind, no obstacles,

33:30.273 --> 33:31.606
in somewhere like
Trafalgar Square...

33:31.641 --> 33:33.709
A pleasant thought.

33:33.743 --> 33:35.149
there would be
an instant radial spread

33:35.174 --> 33:36.767
of vaporized gas

33:36.980 --> 33:38.781
from the center of the blast.

33:38.815 --> 33:41.063
Within the first 65 meters,

33:41.088 --> 33:43.431
anyone enveloped in the vapor
cloud would be killed,

33:43.787 --> 33:44.987
instantly.

33:46.223 --> 33:48.390
As the cloud disseminates
to 80 meters,

33:48.425 --> 33:51.427
there will be irreparable
damage to lungs and liver,

33:51.461 --> 33:55.031
third-degree burning,
blindness.

33:55.065 --> 33:56.766
Death's inevitable.

33:56.834 --> 34:01.004
Up to 100 meters, providing
there's a perfect spread,

34:01.038 --> 34:06.408
it's long-term organ damage,
and death is highly probable.

34:06.443 --> 34:10.817
If this device goes off in a
crowd or in an enclosed area

34:10.842 --> 34:13.447
such as the subway system,
the casualties would be...

34:13.516 --> 34:15.317
Significant.

34:15.351 --> 34:16.819
To say the least.

34:22.024 --> 34:24.493
<i>Michael.</i>

34:24.527 --> 34:28.196
<i>There is nothing left to</i>
<i>discuss about our future,</i>

34:28.231 --> 34:30.032
<i>as a couple, and as a family.</i>

34:33.069 --> 34:35.971
<i>I can no longer wait around</i>
<i>for you to make up your mind.</i>

34:37.474 --> 34:38.940
<i>Your choice is simple.</i>

34:40.342 --> 34:42.444
<i>Either continue to</i>
<i>risk your life,</i>

34:44.481 --> 34:48.650
<i>or come home, and be a</i>
<i>father, and a husband.</i>

34:50.721 --> 34:52.655
<i>I love you.</i>

34:52.688 --> 34:53.889
<i>Kerry.</i>

35:00.964 --> 35:02.398
Not yet, not yet,
not yet.

35:02.432 --> 35:03.632
Oh!

35:07.605 --> 35:09.606
Ahh!

35:14.979 --> 35:16.613
Oh!
I'm sorry.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.383
Fuck.

35:23.054 --> 35:24.355
What's so funny?

35:25.791 --> 35:26.858
Just feel happy.

35:30.730 --> 35:31.930
I feel, uh...

35:35.803 --> 35:37.403
I feel, uh...

35:38.973 --> 35:40.173
You know what?

35:41.242 --> 35:42.442
Never mind.

35:43.577 --> 35:45.111
I understand you.

35:49.549 --> 35:53.819
Sex is an important release
if you're under pressure,

35:55.288 --> 35:58.289
suffering stress
at work...

35:58.323 --> 36:00.425
Yes I am.

36:00.459 --> 36:01.826
For example,

36:03.396 --> 36:07.031
like, your boss doesn't
understand you...

36:07.066 --> 36:08.733
Yeah.

36:08.767 --> 36:11.035
She definitely doesn't.

36:11.070 --> 36:14.305
Let's face it, Colonel Eleanor
Grant is a total bitch.

36:16.108 --> 36:17.842
She is.

36:24.417 --> 36:26.552
But how the fuck
would you know that?

36:29.122 --> 36:32.258
This was one of a stolen,
numbered batch of blank passports.

36:32.292 --> 36:34.793
We've got every airport and
transport hub covered.

36:34.828 --> 36:37.329
If any of the associated
passport numbers come up,

36:37.363 --> 36:40.099
it should flag up on our
system within the hour.

36:40.133 --> 36:42.701
I risk my life for you day in,
day out, and this is the thanks I get?

36:42.736 --> 36:43.869
What?

36:43.903 --> 36:46.505
You sent someone, you
ordered someone to fuck me,

36:46.540 --> 36:48.607
to see if I'm the one
spilling your goddamn secrets!

36:48.641 --> 36:50.309
I'm perfectly entitled to assess
whether I can trust you.

36:50.344 --> 36:51.811
You got a fuckin'
nerve, lady!

36:51.845 --> 36:53.980
- Scott...
- Michael, stay the fuck out of this.

36:54.014 --> 36:55.748
I'll give you a tip.
Stop looking for the dirt on

36:55.782 --> 36:57.984
me and start looking for a
breach in your own section!

36:58.018 --> 36:59.185
Make your point,
soldier.

36:59.219 --> 37:00.486
I'm making my
fucking point!

37:00.521 --> 37:01.654
Well then, what's
your evidence?

37:01.688 --> 37:03.956
I'm your fucking
evidence, lady!

37:03.991 --> 37:05.634
The only reason I'm standing
here is because somebody

37:05.635 --> 37:08.030
compromised John Porter,
and sold him down the river!

37:08.129 --> 37:09.295
So where is this breach?

37:09.330 --> 37:11.331
I don't know. You
tell me, Sinclair,

37:11.365 --> 37:12.899
where's the breach
coming from?

37:12.934 --> 37:14.534
That's enough,
Mr. Scott!

37:14.569 --> 37:16.636
Face the
facts, Colonel.

37:16.671 --> 37:19.306
I don't mind the odds being stacked
against me, but this is bullshit!

37:23.778 --> 37:25.719
Sergeant, we
have a hit.

37:25.744 --> 37:27.909
Passport scanned
entering Poland.

37:27.948 --> 37:29.115
Main screen.

37:30.050 --> 37:31.884
We have our first target.

37:31.918 --> 37:35.754
Passed immigration at Krakow
airport 57 minutes ago.

37:39.392 --> 37:43.094
Oi! What, so that's it? You're
just walking out now?

37:43.128 --> 37:44.729
I'm just sick of this
shit, Michael.

37:44.763 --> 37:46.364
I mean, why are you even here
when you could be at home?

37:46.398 --> 37:47.665
No, I'm not talking
about that.

37:47.699 --> 37:49.967
I am. I've got no one
at home to answer to.

37:50.002 --> 37:50.935
You do.

37:50.969 --> 37:52.370
No, I don't.
She left.

37:53.539 --> 37:55.873
Well, that fuckin' sucks.

37:55.908 --> 37:58.243
So why don't you go and fight for
her, instead of fighting for them?

37:58.277 --> 38:01.380
Because we have to finish
this first, that's why.

38:01.414 --> 38:03.649
Michael, you got a chance
to build a life together,

38:03.683 --> 38:05.885
instead of leaving behind
a trail of dead bodies.

38:05.919 --> 38:07.888
Only a fuckin' idiot
wouldn't take that chance.

38:07.922 --> 38:09.623
I can't leave the
section now.

38:09.657 --> 38:11.233
Well, then you are
a fuckin' idiot.

38:11.234 --> 38:12.732
Jesus, would you stop being
so selfish?

38:12.757 --> 38:14.061
Stop talking about
Scott for five seconds?

38:14.062 --> 38:15.964
I'm not, I'm talking about you.
Latif! Project Dawn! VX gas!

38:15.998 --> 38:17.632
Is any of that ringing a bell
in your head, mate?

38:17.667 --> 38:19.401
Huh?

38:19.435 --> 38:21.670
I can't pretend that
that doesn't exist,

38:21.704 --> 38:24.005
and just go out there and
play happy fuckin' family,

38:24.040 --> 38:25.907
hoping that it's someone
else's kids that get blown up!

38:25.941 --> 38:27.141
Listen.

38:29.044 --> 38:30.411
We have to stop Latif.

38:31.580 --> 38:34.081
We have to find out
who set Porter up.

38:34.116 --> 38:36.717
Now, whether or not we do it, or
we get killed in the process,

38:36.751 --> 38:39.352
we have to finish
this together.

38:43.324 --> 38:45.058
I need you back
in there with me.

38:50.899 --> 38:52.500
What was that last bit?

38:54.069 --> 38:55.236
You what?

38:56.672 --> 38:58.673
I need you back
in there with me.

38:58.707 --> 38:59.874
Heh.

39:00.976 --> 39:02.210
I complete you,
don't I?

39:02.244 --> 39:04.345
You complete me,
that's right.

39:04.379 --> 39:05.880
Heh.

39:05.914 --> 39:08.916
We have a hit on another
missing passport.

39:08.950 --> 39:10.722
It was used to enter
Bratislava airport

39:10.747 --> 39:11.994
less than an hour ago.

39:12.420 --> 39:13.920
There's our
second target.

39:13.954 --> 39:16.556
And, the same Swiss credit
card that paid for the flights

39:16.590 --> 39:18.991
was also used to hire
a van in Krakow.

39:19.025 --> 39:21.060
Bring me the license plate of
that vehicle. Can you get it?

39:21.094 --> 39:22.528
Mmm-hmm.

39:22.562 --> 39:25.931
Krakow, Bratislava.
Why those two cities?

39:25.965 --> 39:28.800
<i>...by large</i>
<i>numbers of international protestors</i>

39:28.834 --> 39:31.002
<i>descending on the city.</i>

39:31.037 --> 39:33.248
<i>Jessica Reid, our security</i>
<i>correspondent, is live for</i>

39:33.273 --> 39:34.473
<i>us in Budapest...</i>

39:34.774 --> 39:35.907
The security summit.

39:35.942 --> 39:38.910
Get that news report on
the big screen, please.

39:38.945 --> 39:42.326
<i>Well, as you can see,</i>
<i>things are quiet now, but, with</i>

39:42.327 --> 39:44.084
<i>the summit delegates arriving tomorrow...</i>
<i>Oh, my god.</i>

39:44.085 --> 39:45.928
Okay. I want you to hack into
every security camera within

39:45.953 --> 39:47.357
a 100-mile radius of Budapest.

39:47.553 --> 39:48.620
<i>...security is pretty</i>
<i>tight here.</i>

39:48.655 --> 39:49.821
<i>Given the security issues...</i>

39:49.856 --> 39:51.123
Get me the head of
Hungarian security.

39:51.157 --> 39:52.358
Roger that.

40:15.747 --> 40:18.454
<i>Thank you very much for your</i>
<i>report, Colonel. We will act</i>

40:18.479 --> 40:20.656
<i>on any sighting of these men.</i>
<i>But I can assure you</i>

40:20.657 --> 40:23.038
<i>the summit is absolutely</i>
<i>watertight.</i>

40:23.888 --> 40:26.695
Mr. Laszlo, can I stress that
we believe Latif is planning

40:26.720 --> 40:28.120
an imminent attack using...

40:28.158 --> 40:30.040
<i>Colonel, do you have any</i>
<i>evidence that Latif is</i>

40:30.065 --> 40:31.471
<i>actually in the city?</i>

40:31.862 --> 40:33.162
Not yet, but...

40:33.197 --> 40:36.032
<i>We are on the highest security</i>
<i>level this city has ever seen.</i>

40:36.067 --> 40:38.253
<i>We are prepared for every</i>
<i>eventuality.</i>

40:38.278 --> 40:40.404
<i>So once again,</i>
<i>I thank you,</i>

40:40.671 --> 40:43.332
<i>but you will kindly leave</i>
<i>Hungarian authorities</i>

40:43.357 --> 40:44.892
<i>to do their job.</i>

40:51.784 --> 40:54.219
I want the crib set
up in Budapest by dawn.

40:54.253 --> 40:56.388
No disclosure outside
this section.

40:56.422 --> 40:57.523
Colonel.

40:57.557 --> 40:58.991
Okay, you heard
the Colonel.

40:59.026 --> 41:00.788
I want everything de-rigged
and ready for transport

41:00.813 --> 41:02.013
within the hour.

41:26.851 --> 41:28.118
Comm relays
are in position.

41:28.153 --> 41:30.154
Okay.

41:30.188 --> 41:31.567
I want to make this clear.

41:31.719 --> 41:34.002
I will tolerate no further
insubordination.

41:34.226 --> 41:35.426
Understood?

41:35.460 --> 41:36.527
Yeah.

41:36.561 --> 41:37.628
Thank you.

41:37.662 --> 41:39.096
Julia?

41:39.130 --> 41:42.667
Yesterday evening we had
positive hits on two cameras.

41:42.701 --> 41:44.001
Twenty-hundred,
the target van,

41:44.036 --> 41:45.503
was spotted at the
intersection of the

41:45.528 --> 41:47.416
M31 and the M3.

41:48.007 --> 41:52.576
Twenty-oh-nine, the M31 and
Route 3 heading southwest.

41:52.611 --> 41:54.678
No further hits anywhere
along this ring road,

41:54.713 --> 41:56.581
which means they must
still be somewhere in

41:56.606 --> 41:57.806
the Kerepes district.

41:57.849 --> 41:59.049
Sergeant?

42:00.551 --> 42:02.185
We're waiting for our geostationary
satellite to come up.

42:02.220 --> 42:03.853
- What have you got?
- Black Mercedes.

42:03.888 --> 42:05.621
In the meantime, we're
piggybacking an ESA satellite feed

42:05.656 --> 42:07.089
to triangulate the area.

42:07.123 --> 42:08.958
I think we've
found the van.

42:11.594 --> 42:12.994
Here's the
location info.

42:13.029 --> 42:17.298
It's at an abandoned clinic on
the outskirts of Kerepes.

42:17.332 --> 42:19.166
We're gonna lose the
satellite feed in 30 minutes.

42:19.201 --> 42:20.234
I want you both out there now.

42:20.268 --> 42:21.769
On it.

42:21.803 --> 42:22.737
You drive.

42:22.771 --> 42:23.614
Good work.

42:23.615 --> 42:25.037
<i>Perhaps</i>
<i>the most pressing issue</i>

42:25.038 --> 42:28.251
<i>facing world leaders</i>
<i>is Pakistan's nuclear arsenal.</i>

42:52.638 --> 42:55.940
Losing satellite telemetry
in 10 seconds...

42:59.579 --> 43:02.815
3, 2, 1.

43:02.849 --> 43:04.583
Shit.

43:04.617 --> 43:06.218
<i>Blind on visuals.</i>

43:06.286 --> 43:07.453
Just you and me, mate.

43:07.487 --> 43:09.522
Eh, that's the
way I like it.

43:13.927 --> 43:15.295
Vehicle leaving site.

43:15.329 --> 43:17.030
<i>Registration?</i>

43:17.065 --> 43:18.231
Negative.

43:50.230 --> 43:51.797
Everything's finished.

44:31.675 --> 44:32.975
Shit!

44:33.009 --> 44:34.043
Michael!

44:34.077 --> 44:35.111
Ow!

44:35.145 --> 44:36.312
What the fuck are
you doing?

44:41.719 --> 44:42.919
Fuck!

44:54.332 --> 44:56.233
I'm sorry,
Colonel. Still no response.

44:56.267 --> 44:57.842
Try them again.

44:57.843 --> 44:59.578
Scott,
Stonebridge, this is 20,

44:59.603 --> 45:01.572
please respond, over.

45:04.041 --> 45:05.708
We've been trying to
get a hold of you for

45:05.733 --> 45:06.842
the past twenty minutes.

45:06.843 --> 45:08.844
Why the fuck did
you go off comms?

45:15.819 --> 45:17.319
Where's Stonebridge?

45:19.356 --> 45:20.790
Why isn't he...
