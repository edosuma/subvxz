01:24.209 --> 01:26.378
Psst!

01:29.298 --> 01:31.466
Got you!

01:46.648 --> 01:49.651
Now look here...

01:55.157 --> 01:56.408
But mum!

01:56.491 --> 02:00.579
Close the window, John.

02:17.012 --> 02:21.642
To Sherlock Holmes,
she was always "the woman,"

02:21.767 --> 02:27.773
the beautiful Irena Adler of
dubious and questionable memory.

02:45.499 --> 02:49.878
At the time of our involvement
in the Irena Adler case,

02:49.962 --> 02:52.714
Holmes and I had been sharing
rooms in Baker Street

02:52.840 --> 02:55.217
for some years.

02:55.300 --> 02:58.345
My practice had caused me
to be absent in the country

02:58.470 --> 03:00.305
for several days.

03:00.389 --> 03:04.643
As usual, after leaving
Holmes for any length of time,

03:04.726 --> 03:09.815
I returned filled with
apprehension as to his mood.

03:15.404 --> 03:16.029
Oh!

03:16.113 --> 03:17.656
Oh, hello, Mrs. Hudson.

03:17.739 --> 03:22.494
Dr. Watson, just look at you,
half soaked to the skin!

03:22.578 --> 03:23.412
Yes, well,
I am not surprised,

03:23.537 --> 03:26.707
I have just spent 20 minutes
standing in the pouring rain

03:26.832 --> 03:27.416
waiting for a cab.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.793
It won't do that
old wound of yours any good

03:29.918 --> 03:31.503
getting so wet, Doctor.

03:31.587 --> 03:32.337
I know.

03:32.421 --> 03:34.423
I'll just take this
coat and your hat

03:34.548 --> 03:36.049
and see that
they're properly dried.

03:36.133 --> 03:39.219
Mrs. Hudson,
I haven't eaten all day.

03:39.303 --> 03:41.221
I do hope supper
will be up very soon.

03:41.305 --> 03:42.931
That's very doubtful.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.558
I don't know what's
come over Mr. Holmes,

03:44.641 --> 03:46.393
he seems to be
all on edge.

03:46.476 --> 03:49.313
I'm not to bring up supper
until I'm called.

03:49.438 --> 03:52.065
Those are his orders.

03:52.191 --> 03:54.651
Thank you, Mrs. Hudson.

04:34.191 --> 04:36.443
My dear Holmes,

04:45.327 --> 04:50.249
what is it tonight,
morphine or cocaine?

04:50.332 --> 04:53.877
Well, I can
strongly recommend

04:54.002 --> 04:59.967
a seven percent solution
of cocaine.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.636
Would you care to try it?

05:02.719 --> 05:05.556
No, indeed!

05:05.681 --> 05:08.141
I speak not only as your friend,
but as a medical man.

05:08.225 --> 05:12.646
How can you risk such damage
to the great powers

05:12.729 --> 05:15.107
with which you have
been endowed?!

05:15.190 --> 05:15.607
I cannot tell you

05:15.691 --> 05:17.776
how it clarifies
and stimulates the mind.

05:17.860 --> 05:21.321
Yes, and destroys it in time!

05:24.074 --> 05:28.829
My mind rebels
at stagnation.

05:28.912 --> 05:33.625
Give me problems,
give me work,

05:33.709 --> 05:35.419
give me the most
abstruse cryptogram,

05:35.544 --> 05:40.591
the most intricate analysis,
and I'm in my proper atmosphere.

05:40.716 --> 05:45.345
Then I can dispense
with artificial stimulants.

05:45.429 --> 05:49.766
But I abhor the dull routine
of existence.

05:49.892 --> 05:54.688
I crave mental exultation.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.857
That is why I have chosen
my own profession,

05:56.982 --> 05:59.276
or rather created it,

05:59.401 --> 06:02.863
for I am the only one
in the world.

06:02.946 --> 06:05.699
The only unofficial detective.

06:05.824 --> 06:08.660
The only unofficial
consulting detective.

06:08.744 --> 06:10.913
I take no credit in my cases.

06:11.038 --> 06:11.705
The work itself,

06:11.830 --> 06:14.374
the pleasure of finding a field
for my particular powers

06:14.500 --> 06:17.461
is my highest reward.

06:22.591 --> 06:25.636
You can close that drawer.

06:25.761 --> 06:29.014
You have made the wrong
diagnosis, Doctor!

06:29.097 --> 06:34.436
I have my stimulant here.

06:39.525 --> 06:41.818
I hope you enjoyed your week
in the country.

06:41.944 --> 06:43.612
It was good
for the appetite.

06:43.737 --> 06:47.658
Incidentally, I do wish
you would ring for supper.

06:50.661 --> 06:52.913
What is this?

06:52.996 --> 06:56.083
Yes, I must get ready
for my visitor.

06:56.208 --> 07:00.212
It came by
the morning post.

07:02.798 --> 07:05.592
Give me your observations.

07:05.676 --> 07:10.681
Well, it's undated and without
either signature or address.

07:10.806 --> 07:14.518
Good, read it aloud.

07:14.643 --> 07:16.520
"Dear Mr. Holmes:

07:16.645 --> 07:19.815
There will call upon you tonight
at a quarter to eight

07:19.940 --> 07:21.859
a gentleman who"--

07:21.984 --> 07:23.527
good heavens, we've only
a few minutes, Holmes.

07:23.652 --> 07:26.280
Go on.

07:26.363 --> 07:28.365
"A gentleman who desires
to consult with you

07:28.490 --> 07:31.410
upon a matter of
the very deepest moment.

07:31.493 --> 07:33.620
Your recent services to one
of the royal houses of Europe

07:33.745 --> 07:35.622
have shown that you are one
who may be safely trusted

07:35.706 --> 07:38.167
with matters which
are of an importance

07:38.292 --> 07:41.170
which can hardly
be exaggerated.

07:41.253 --> 07:45.465
This account of you we have
from all quarters received,

07:45.549 --> 07:48.051
be in your chamber then."

07:48.177 --> 07:50.721
Good--good heavens,
this is a mystery, indeed.

07:50.846 --> 07:52.139
What do you
imagine it means?

07:52.222 --> 07:53.557
I have no data yet.

07:53.682 --> 07:56.226
It is a capital mistake
to theorize before one has data.

07:56.351 --> 07:56.727
Mm.

07:56.852 --> 07:57.853
But the note itself,

07:57.978 --> 08:01.148
what do you
deduce from it?

08:01.231 --> 08:02.065
It's a man's writing.

08:02.191 --> 08:03.859
Good.

08:03.984 --> 08:07.487
Presumably well-to-do,
it's expensive paper, this.

08:07.613 --> 08:09.156
It's peculiarly
strong and stiff.

08:09.281 --> 08:10.866
Peculiar,
that is the very word.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.701
It is not English
paper at all.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.579
Hold it up
to the light.

08:15.704 --> 08:20.709
Ah, large E,
small g, large P, and G

08:20.834 --> 08:24.129
with a small t
woven into the texture.

08:24.213 --> 08:26.423
And that is?

08:26.548 --> 08:28.550
Maker's monogram.

08:28.675 --> 08:29.843
Excellent, Watson!

08:29.927 --> 08:32.221
Come along!

08:33.472 --> 08:37.808
Let us consult
our continental gazetteer.

08:37.893 --> 08:40.687
Your cigars; you see, I was not
unmindful of your return.

08:40.812 --> 08:41.730
Oh, Holmes!

08:41.855 --> 08:43.232
Would you
care for some whiskey?

08:43.357 --> 08:45.526
Later, perhaps,
when we've eaten.

08:45.609 --> 08:49.363
The monogram is an abbreviation
for Papier Gesellschaft,

08:49.446 --> 08:51.740
which is the German
for "paper company."

08:51.865 --> 08:58.539
And the Eg,
Eglow, Eglonitz, Egria,

08:58.622 --> 09:00.541
a German-speaking district
of Bohemia

09:00.624 --> 09:02.584
noted for its numerous
glass factories

09:02.668 --> 09:04.378
and paper mills, there.

09:04.461 --> 09:06.922
Bohemia,
the kingdom of Bohemia.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.966
And the note is
written by a German.

09:09.091 --> 09:10.592
You see,
"this account of you

09:10.717 --> 09:12.469
we have from
all quarters received,"

09:12.594 --> 09:14.888
only a German is so
uncourteous to his words.

09:14.972 --> 09:18.767
So we are to expect
a German from Bohemia.

09:21.436 --> 09:24.356
Here he is,

09:24.439 --> 09:29.736
drawn by a pair,
a nice little brougham.

09:29.820 --> 09:32.239
There's money in this case,
Watson, if there's nothing else.

09:32.322 --> 09:34.783
Holmes, I think your visitor
will want me out of the way.

09:34.867 --> 09:37.452
Not a bit, Doctor,
stay where you are!

09:37.578 --> 09:40.455
I am lost without
my Boswell.

09:40.581 --> 09:44.084
But he sounded so secretive.

09:44.168 --> 09:46.420
I may need your help,
and so may he.

09:46.545 --> 09:48.755
Now, stay in that armchair,
and give me your full attention.

09:48.881 --> 09:50.424
Here he comes.

09:59.892 --> 10:00.434
I'm sorry, sir,

10:00.517 --> 10:02.603
but you cannot come in here
unannounced like this!

10:02.728 --> 10:06.356
Mr. Holmes does not see anybody
without appointment!

10:16.992 --> 10:18.619
Oh, I'm so sorry,
Mr. Holmes!

10:18.702 --> 10:20.537
There was nothing
I could do!

10:20.662 --> 10:23.540
It's perfectly all right,
Mrs. Hudson!

10:23.665 --> 10:24.875
If you would
kindly leave us.

10:25.000 --> 10:25.459
Yes.

10:25.584 --> 10:26.084
And close the door.

10:26.168 --> 10:26.668
Of course.

10:26.793 --> 10:29.463
Thank you.

10:41.183 --> 10:42.726
You read my note?

10:42.851 --> 10:44.394
Yes. Pray take a seat!

10:47.314 --> 10:49.233
This is my friend and
colleague, Dr. Watson,

10:49.358 --> 10:52.152
who is occasionally good enough
to help me in my cases!

10:52.236 --> 10:54.780
How do you do, sir.

11:00.077 --> 11:02.830
Who do I have
the honor to address?

11:02.955 --> 11:08.377
You may address me as the Count
Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman.

11:08.502 --> 11:11.505
I should much prefer to
communicate with you alone.

11:11.630 --> 11:14.299
No, it is both, or none.

11:14.383 --> 11:15.551
You may say
before this gentleman

11:15.676 --> 11:18.470
anything which you may wish
to say to me.

11:18.554 --> 11:19.888
Very well, I take your word

11:19.972 --> 11:22.891
that he is a man of honor
and discretion.

11:22.975 --> 11:26.603
But I must begin by binding
you both to absolute secrecy

11:26.728 --> 11:28.564
for a period of two years.

11:28.647 --> 11:29.898
Indeed?

11:30.023 --> 11:30.691
At the end of that time

11:30.774 --> 11:32.818
the matter will be
of no importance.

11:32.901 --> 11:34.319
At present it is
of such weight

11:34.403 --> 11:38.448
that it may have an influence
upon European history.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.787
I promise.

11:43.912 --> 11:47.124
And I.

11:49.918 --> 11:52.671
You will excuse this mask.

11:52.754 --> 11:54.423
The august person
who employs me

11:54.548 --> 11:57.676
wishes his agent
to be unknown to you.

11:57.759 --> 12:01.597
In fact, I may confess that
the title I have given you

12:01.680 --> 12:04.183
is not exactly my own.

12:04.266 --> 12:07.895
I was aware of that.

12:10.814 --> 12:13.775
The circumstances
are of great delicacy;

12:13.859 --> 12:17.070
every precaution must be taken
to prevent an immense scandal

12:17.154 --> 12:18.572
which would
seriously compromise

12:18.655 --> 12:22.618
one of the royal houses
of Europe.

12:22.701 --> 12:24.745
To speak plainly,

12:24.828 --> 12:27.498
the matter concerns
the great House of Ormstein,

12:27.623 --> 12:30.918
hereditary kings of Bohemia.

12:31.001 --> 12:35.255
I was aware of that, too,
your Majesty.

12:44.389 --> 12:49.478
You are right...

12:56.026 --> 12:58.904
I am the King.

12:59.488 --> 13:01.657
Why should I attempt
to conceal it?

13:01.782 --> 13:04.243
Why, indeed?

13:04.326 --> 13:05.494
Your Majesty had not spoken

13:05.619 --> 13:07.496
before I was aware
that I was addressing

13:07.621 --> 13:11.625
Wilhelm Gottsreich
Sigismond von Ormstein,

13:11.708 --> 13:15.504
Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein,
and hereditary King of Bohemia.

13:15.629 --> 13:19.091
And in passing,
the finest dualist in Europe.

13:19.174 --> 13:21.301
You have killed
four opponents.

13:21.426 --> 13:23.804
Honorably.

13:23.887 --> 13:26.139
Of course.

13:33.021 --> 13:35.190
The facts are briefly these:

13:35.315 --> 13:36.984
Ah!

13:37.067 --> 13:41.154
Some 10 years ago, during
a lengthy visit to Warsaw,

13:41.238 --> 13:44.867
I made the acquaintance
of the well known adventuress,

13:44.992 --> 13:50.372
Irena Adler.

13:50.455 --> 13:53.333
The name is no doubt
familiar to you.

13:53.417 --> 13:58.088
Kindly look her up in my index,
will you, Watson.

14:00.215 --> 14:05.387
So, I deduce that your Majesty
became entangled with this lady,

14:05.512 --> 14:06.680
wrote her some
compromising letters,

14:06.763 --> 14:08.807
and is now desirous
of getting them back.

14:08.891 --> 14:10.142
Precisely so.

14:10.225 --> 14:12.436
But how could
you know that?

14:15.939 --> 14:20.152
Italian general's staff...

14:20.235 --> 14:27.576
Ah, Adler, Irena,
born New Jersey, 1858.

14:27.659 --> 14:28.410
Is this the lady?

14:28.535 --> 14:30.662
New Jersey, let me see.

14:30.746 --> 14:32.498
Singer, contralto

14:32.581 --> 14:36.752
appeared at La Scala, opera
houses Petersburg and Warsaw,

14:36.877 --> 14:38.378
retired from
the operatic stage,

14:38.504 --> 14:39.838
now living in London,

14:39.922 --> 14:42.090
makes occasional
concert appearances.

14:42.216 --> 14:44.092
That is the lady.

15:31.640 --> 15:34.101
Was there a secret marriage?

15:34.184 --> 15:35.519
None.

15:35.644 --> 15:37.604
No legal papers
or certificates?

15:37.688 --> 15:38.939
None.

15:39.022 --> 15:40.774
Then I fail to follow
your Majesty.

15:40.899 --> 15:44.069
If this person
should produce your letters

15:44.152 --> 15:46.488
for blackmailing
or other purposes,

15:46.613 --> 15:50.576
how is she to prove
their authenticity?

15:50.659 --> 15:51.660
There is the writing.

15:51.785 --> 15:53.662
Pooh, pooh! Forgery.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.873
My private writing paper.

15:55.998 --> 15:57.624
Stolen.

15:57.749 --> 15:58.876
My own seal.

15:59.001 --> 16:00.627
Imitated.

16:00.711 --> 16:01.962
My photograph.

16:02.045 --> 16:04.631
Bought.

16:04.715 --> 16:08.260
We were both
in that photograph.

16:43.712 --> 16:47.466
Oh, dear, dear, dear.

16:47.549 --> 16:51.178
Yes, that is very bad.

16:51.303 --> 16:55.349
Your Majesty has certainly
committed an indiscretion.

16:55.474 --> 17:03.106
She was beautiful, bewitching,
clever, daring.

17:57.703 --> 18:01.456
I was only
Crown Prince then.

18:01.582 --> 18:03.834
I was young!

18:03.959 --> 18:06.753
I am but 30 now.

18:06.837 --> 18:07.462
Of course,
your Majesty

18:07.588 --> 18:10.966
has attempted to recover
the photograph?

18:11.049 --> 18:13.802
We have tried and failed.

18:13.927 --> 18:15.804
Then your Majesty must pay.

18:15.888 --> 18:17.222
It must be bought.

18:17.306 --> 18:18.932
She will not sell.

18:19.057 --> 18:21.059
Stolen, then.

18:21.143 --> 18:23.645
Five attempts
have been made.

18:23.770 --> 18:27.482
Twice burglars in my pay
ransacked her house.

18:27.608 --> 18:30.652
Once we diverted her luggage
when she traveled.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.780
Twice she has
been waylaid.

18:33.906 --> 18:36.200
There has been
no sign of it.

18:38.994 --> 18:42.372
You mock?!

18:42.498 --> 18:44.333
It is serious!

18:44.416 --> 18:45.334
Yes.

18:45.417 --> 18:48.003
Yes, it is
very serious, indeed.

18:48.128 --> 18:50.130
Well, what does she propose
to do with this photograph

18:50.255 --> 18:54.384
if not to extort money?

18:54.510 --> 18:58.013
To ruin me.

18:58.138 --> 18:59.890
How?

19:00.015 --> 19:02.184
I'm about to be married.

19:02.309 --> 19:03.977
So I've heard.

19:04.061 --> 19:06.522
To the Princess Clotilde
Lothman von Saxe-Meningen,

19:06.605 --> 19:08.607
and second daughter
to the King of Scandinavia.

19:08.690 --> 19:10.484
It is a brilliant match.

19:10.609 --> 19:11.401
Precisely.

19:11.527 --> 19:14.655
But you will know the
strict principles of her family.

19:14.780 --> 19:18.325
She's herself
the soul of delicacy.

19:18.408 --> 19:20.244
A shadow of doubt
as to my conduct

19:20.369 --> 19:22.162
would bring the matter
to an end.

19:29.378 --> 19:31.213
And Irena Adler?

19:31.338 --> 19:34.216
Threatens to send them
the photograph.

19:34.299 --> 19:36.426
And she will do it.

19:36.552 --> 19:39.471
She has a soul of steel.

19:39.555 --> 19:41.515
She's more beautiful than
any other woman I've known,

19:41.598 --> 19:43.892
more resolute
than any man.

19:44.017 --> 19:47.396
There are no lengths to which
she would not go, none,

19:47.521 --> 19:51.692
to prevent my marriage
to another woman!

19:53.735 --> 19:56.989
Your Majesty,

19:57.072 --> 20:02.661
why is this lady
so vindictive?

20:02.744 --> 20:06.373
Oh, there was once
some talk of marriage.

20:06.498 --> 20:08.041
Ha!

20:08.125 --> 20:13.797
She would not see
that it was impossible!

20:25.017 --> 20:29.021
You are sure that she has not
sent the photograph yet?

20:29.104 --> 20:30.397
I am sure.

20:30.480 --> 20:31.607
Why?

20:31.732 --> 20:33.609
It may be on its way
at this very moment.

20:33.734 --> 20:35.319
Because she has said
that she would send it

20:35.444 --> 20:39.156
on the day when the betrothal
was publicly proclaimed.

20:39.281 --> 20:41.617
That will be next Monday.

20:41.700 --> 20:43.368
But I must leave London
on Friday

20:43.452 --> 20:45.787
to be home
for the ceremony.

20:45.913 --> 20:49.291
Ah, then we do
have three days.

20:49.374 --> 20:50.501
Well, that is
very fortunate,

20:50.626 --> 20:54.129
for I do have
other matters in hand.

20:54.254 --> 20:56.798
Where can I find
your Majesty in London?

20:56.924 --> 21:00.093
At the Langham Hotel,

21:00.219 --> 21:02.262
as the Count Von Kramm,
remember.

21:02.387 --> 21:02.971
Yes, of course.

21:03.096 --> 21:04.973
And as to expenditure?

21:11.730 --> 21:17.861
Here are 300 pounds in gold,
and 700 in notes.

21:17.986 --> 21:24.284
And Miss Irena Adler's address?

21:24.368 --> 21:25.035
Goodnight, your Majesty,

21:25.160 --> 21:30.541
and I trust we shall soon
have good news for you.

21:49.852 --> 21:54.731
Holmes, we can dine
at Romano's,

21:54.857 --> 21:58.485
but we only have three days,
till Friday.

21:58.610 --> 22:01.196
Oh, it must be settled
by Friday.

22:01.321 --> 22:02.155
The composer Tchaikovsky

22:02.239 --> 22:04.283
is conducting his own works
at the St. James's Hall.

22:04.366 --> 22:05.409
No, no, no, no!

22:05.534 --> 22:09.163
It must be
settled by Friday.

22:11.707 --> 22:15.169
My dear Watson,
I'd like to be alone.

22:15.252 --> 22:16.003
You are hungry?

22:16.128 --> 22:17.171
Yes.

22:17.296 --> 22:19.381
I'm sure Mrs. Hudson will
bring you up a sandwich.

22:19.506 --> 22:20.007
A sandwich?

22:20.090 --> 22:22.759
We will not discuss this matter
until tomorrow afternoon.

22:22.885 --> 22:24.887
Goodnight.

23:36.917 --> 23:40.546
Better than working,
isn't it, mate?

23:40.629 --> 23:41.588
What is?

23:41.672 --> 23:43.131
Looking on.

23:43.215 --> 23:47.219
I'll change with you
any time, gov.

23:47.302 --> 23:49.388
And what
position are you?

23:49.471 --> 23:53.725
Eight weeks,
a mere first-class groom.

23:53.809 --> 23:55.811
Are ya?

23:55.936 --> 23:58.438
Well, you can give
me a hand if you like.

23:58.522 --> 24:03.277
I see you're all right.

24:03.360 --> 24:04.945
Why not?

24:05.070 --> 24:07.573
Give her the price
of the booze.

24:07.656 --> 24:13.871
I thought
it was the booze.

24:13.996 --> 24:20.043
Strap the mare,
show us what you can do.

24:49.448 --> 24:52.743
I spent a couple of hours
with the cabbie and his cronies.

24:52.868 --> 24:55.162
Miss Irena Adler

24:55.245 --> 24:58.999
has certainly turned all
men's heads in those parts.

24:59.124 --> 25:03.670
She is the daintiest thing
under a bonnet on this planet,

25:03.754 --> 25:09.510
so say the Serpentine-mews
fraternity, to a man.

25:09.593 --> 25:12.262
She lives quietly,

25:12.387 --> 25:14.640
drives out at five
in the evening,

25:14.723 --> 25:18.435
returns at
seven sharp for dinner.

25:18.560 --> 25:21.605
Seldom goes out at other times,
except when she sings.

25:21.730 --> 25:25.859
She has only one male visitor,
but sees a good deal of him.

25:25.943 --> 25:28.195
He never calls less than
once a day, and often twice.

25:28.278 --> 25:31.490
His name is a Mr. Godfrey
Norton, of the Inner Temple.

25:31.573 --> 25:35.202
You see the advantages of having
a cabman as a confidant.

25:35.285 --> 25:41.708
Mr. Godfrey Norton is a lawyer,
that is important.

25:41.792 --> 25:44.753
Ominous, perhaps.

25:44.837 --> 25:49.550
Why his repeated visits?

25:49.675 --> 25:55.389
Is she his client,
friend, or mistress?

25:55.472 --> 25:57.182
If he is her lawyer,

25:57.266 --> 26:02.271
he might have the photograph
to his strong box.

26:02.396 --> 26:08.110
If her lover, he might
not even know of it.

26:58.785 --> 27:01.788
She had just begun
to sing,

27:01.872 --> 27:04.208
she has the voice
of an angel, Watson,

27:04.333 --> 27:07.211
when a truly surprising
chain of events overtook me,

27:07.336 --> 27:08.295
starting with the arrival

27:08.420 --> 27:14.635
of someone I presumed to be
Mr. Godfrey Noble.

27:14.718 --> 27:16.803
Wait for me, will you.

27:23.769 --> 27:26.522
Fetch your
mistress's carriage.

28:15.028 --> 28:16.488
Drive like the devil,

28:16.613 --> 28:17.865
Church of St. Monica,
Edgeware Road.

28:17.990 --> 28:20.200
I must arrive there at least
five minutes before 12:00.

28:20.284 --> 28:24.538
That gives you 20 minutes.
Half a guinea if you do it.

29:00.365 --> 29:03.410
She is a lovely woman, Watson,

29:03.535 --> 29:07.164
with a face that
a man might die for.

29:07.289 --> 29:11.251
A face a man might die for--

29:11.335 --> 29:14.087
unusual language
for you, Holmes.

29:14.171 --> 29:15.797
A metaphor,
Watson, nothing else.

29:15.923 --> 29:18.800
I was just about to sprint after
the landau and perch on the back

29:18.926 --> 29:20.928
when another cab
came through the street.

29:21.053 --> 29:23.555
He looked twice
at such a shabby fare,

29:23.639 --> 29:26.266
but I jumped in before
he had time to object,

29:26.391 --> 29:27.684
showed him a handful
of sovereigns

29:27.809 --> 29:28.393
and promised him one

29:28.477 --> 29:31.021
if he would get me to the Church
of St. Monica within 20 minutes.

29:31.146 --> 29:33.857
Now, I don't think

29:33.982 --> 29:39.571
that I have ever been driven
faster in a cab.

29:39.655 --> 29:44.701
They were there before us.

30:01.552 --> 30:03.637
Look, I'm very sorry,
Mr. Norton, but l--

30:03.720 --> 30:05.681
For pity sake,
it's almost midday.

30:05.806 --> 30:07.683
The latest time
allowed by law.

30:07.808 --> 30:09.685
I would have called in one
of those confounded churchmen

30:09.810 --> 30:11.770
but I saw no reason to let them
know our business

30:11.854 --> 30:13.230
and I sent them
off for a drink.

30:13.355 --> 30:14.815
Oh, dear Lord!

30:14.898 --> 30:17.442
Godfrey.

30:21.029 --> 30:24.992
You, you,
come here, man!

30:27.202 --> 30:29.663
Yes, I mean you!

30:29.746 --> 30:31.665
We've only a few minutes left
or it won't be legal!

30:31.748 --> 30:34.918
Come man, come!

30:41.717 --> 30:46.180
Hold this and
do as you're told.

30:46.263 --> 30:49.266
You'll be paid.

30:50.267 --> 30:54.771
Ah, we have our witness.

30:54.897 --> 30:58.692
The ceremony may proceed.

31:00.736 --> 31:04.698
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
here in the sight of God

31:04.823 --> 31:08.368
to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony

31:08.452 --> 31:11.330
which is an honorable estate
instituted of God

31:11.413 --> 31:13.332
in the time of
man's innocency,

31:13.415 --> 31:15.751
signifying unto us
the mystical union

31:15.876 --> 31:18.253
that is betwixt Christ
and his church.

31:26.803 --> 31:27.387
Irena.

31:27.513 --> 31:30.140
I allowed you
to persuade me,

31:30.265 --> 31:34.394
now you must allow me
to persuade you.

31:34.478 --> 31:36.813
I shall see you tomorrow.

31:36.939 --> 31:40.400
At the very first moment.

31:40.526 --> 31:43.946
I love you.

32:01.255 --> 32:05.551
John.

32:06.760 --> 32:10.264
Hey, you!

32:14.768 --> 32:16.770
Come here, my man.

32:18.981 --> 32:21.441
Come here.

32:23.068 --> 32:26.446
Godfrey, let me.

32:38.834 --> 32:42.212
Sir, I want to thank you

32:42.337 --> 32:46.383
for being so miraculously
present when we needed you.

32:46.508 --> 32:49.803
How fortunate that you have
remained close by.

32:49.887 --> 32:54.141
Well, I'm in no hurry, mum.

32:54.224 --> 32:57.394
I hope you will accept this.

33:00.731 --> 33:03.066
I don't need no tip, mum.

33:03.192 --> 33:10.782
Oh, sir, let us call it
a little souvenir.

33:25.172 --> 33:28.300
She gave me a sovereign.

33:28.383 --> 33:29.218
Here it is.

33:29.343 --> 33:34.264
What an extraordinary
turn of events!

33:34.389 --> 33:36.225
I shall wear it
on my watch chain

33:36.350 --> 33:40.145
in memory
of the occasion.

33:40.229 --> 33:43.065
And what now?

33:43.190 --> 33:43.982
Well, during the ceremony

33:44.066 --> 33:46.151
I thought my plans
had been overthrown.

33:46.235 --> 33:47.861
If they had made
an immediate departure,

33:47.986 --> 33:48.737
it would have necessitated

33:48.862 --> 33:51.615
the most prompt and
energetic measures on my part.

33:51.740 --> 33:56.745
But, he went back to the Temple,
and she went to her own home,

33:56.870 --> 34:00.582
thus, giving us
time to act.

34:00.707 --> 34:02.876
How?

34:02.960 --> 34:06.421
Doctor, I shall require all
your courage and alertness.

34:06.547 --> 34:09.550
I shall be delighted!

34:09.675 --> 34:12.010
You don't mind
breaking the law?

34:12.094 --> 34:13.594
Not in the least.

34:13.679 --> 34:18.766
Nor running the chance
of arrest?

34:18.891 --> 34:22.563
Not in a good cause.

34:22.688 --> 34:24.481
Oh, the cause is excellent.

34:24.606 --> 34:26.108
Well, then I am your man.

34:26.233 --> 34:27.734
Splendid.

35:02.644 --> 35:07.900
Now, the--
the question is--

35:07.983 --> 35:12.488
Holmes, you really do
look quite remarkable!

35:14.823 --> 35:16.825
You know, the question is
where to find the photograph.

35:16.950 --> 35:18.869
I mean, the house
has twice been burgled.

35:18.994 --> 35:20.913
She was too clever for them.

35:20.996 --> 35:23.248
She is a remarkable woman.

35:23.332 --> 35:25.250
Well, they must
have searched very thoroughly.

35:25.334 --> 35:27.669
They did not know
how to look!

35:27.794 --> 35:30.172
And how will you look?

35:30.297 --> 35:32.883
I shall not look.

35:33.008 --> 35:34.843
What then?

35:34.968 --> 35:37.179
I will allow her
to show me.

35:40.474 --> 35:41.642
But she'll refused.

35:41.767 --> 35:42.809
She will not be able to.

35:42.935 --> 35:46.396
Ah, we draw near
the scene of action.

35:46.522 --> 35:48.315
We had better
walk from here.

36:07.626 --> 36:09.336
You know your instructions.

36:09.461 --> 36:11.713
When you raise your hand,
I act.

36:11.839 --> 36:14.299
And we meet at the rendezvous
in 10 minutes.

36:14.383 --> 36:16.969
Here she comes.

36:29.731 --> 36:30.941
Oh, no, you don't.

36:31.066 --> 36:32.484
I was here first.

36:32.568 --> 36:33.694
I opened the door, lady.

36:33.777 --> 36:35.445
He never,
no, it was me!

36:35.571 --> 36:38.031
Clear off, you two!

36:41.910 --> 36:44.163
Let-me-go!

36:44.246 --> 36:45.414
Opening carriage doors

36:45.539 --> 36:48.292
is a legitimate means of
livelihood, Mr. [inaudible].

36:48.417 --> 36:51.712
You ain't gonna stop
a man earning a copper, see.

36:51.795 --> 36:52.713
Let me pass.

36:52.796 --> 36:54.840
You there,
let go of my coachman!

36:54.923 --> 36:56.925
Take the bread
from me mouth, would 'ya?

36:57.050 --> 36:59.344
I'll fill your mouth, chum.

36:59.428 --> 37:00.596
Oh!

37:14.860 --> 37:17.237
Oh, no, no, please,
please don't, men,

37:17.321 --> 37:19.990
please, I beg you,
please I beg of you!

37:20.115 --> 37:23.911
Madam, I must protect you!

37:23.994 --> 37:27.956
Now stop that,
you and you, stop that.

37:28.040 --> 37:29.625
Oh!

37:30.501 --> 37:31.585
Stand back!

37:31.710 --> 37:34.796
You see what you've done!

37:37.090 --> 37:37.966
He's dead!

37:38.091 --> 37:41.929
Scamper, mate,
before the coppers come!

37:42.012 --> 37:44.598
He's still breathing,
but he's taken a bad knock.

37:44.723 --> 37:45.766
I am sorry, ma'am.

37:45.891 --> 37:47.100
You did your best, John.

37:47.226 --> 37:48.727
Is he badly hurt?

37:48.810 --> 37:52.272
It is only superficial,
but he needs attention, quickly.

37:52.356 --> 37:54.816
But he can't lie
on the street.

37:54.942 --> 37:57.945
Bring him into the house.

38:02.366 --> 38:04.785
All right, sir.

38:47.828 --> 38:49.496
Oh, you're conscious.

38:49.621 --> 38:53.834
Thank goodness,
you are a brave man.

38:53.959 --> 38:56.587
Over here, Willot.

38:59.923 --> 39:01.675
No, no, stand back,

39:01.758 --> 39:04.344
I shall look after
my friend in need.

39:04.469 --> 39:08.432
Sir, will you
look toward me.

39:08.557 --> 39:11.977
Oh, it is no sight
for a lady.

39:12.102 --> 39:14.980
I have strong nerves,
dear friend.

39:15.063 --> 39:16.857
No, no, I cannot permit.

39:16.982 --> 39:19.318
Thank you.

39:19.401 --> 39:22.321
A bandage.

39:22.404 --> 39:26.200
As you wish.

39:51.266 --> 39:54.311
I'm so relieved that
your wound isn't serious.

39:54.436 --> 39:59.816
Well, it is but shallow,
and the concussion wears off.

40:09.284 --> 40:12.579
How extraordinary.

40:12.663 --> 40:14.581
Madam?

40:14.665 --> 40:15.624
That so many people

40:15.749 --> 40:20.003
should gather in such
a quiet little turning.

40:20.128 --> 40:21.505
Well, it's the gang, madam,

40:21.630 --> 40:25.092
it was all pre-arranged
to rob you.

40:25.217 --> 40:28.220
All those men
to snatch one little purse.

40:28.303 --> 40:31.265
Oh, no, dear friend,
it wouldn't have paid them.

40:31.348 --> 40:34.017
My vocation takes me
much amongst the poor

40:34.142 --> 40:35.727
and even
the criminal classes, madam.

40:35.811 --> 40:38.605
Look at those people staring,

40:38.689 --> 40:44.736
curiosity is so unseemly,
but I fear universal.

40:44.820 --> 40:49.783
Oh, I am so sorry,
I think I'm going to faint.

40:49.908 --> 40:52.327
Oh, air, I need some air!

40:52.452 --> 40:54.538
Willot, the window1

40:58.083 --> 41:00.169
Oh!

41:08.802 --> 41:10.053
Some drinking water.

41:10.179 --> 41:15.559
Are there any smelling salts?

41:30.574 --> 41:34.453
Madam, madam,
I think I can smell fire.

41:34.536 --> 41:37.289
What?

41:37.372 --> 41:40.292
Fire, fire!

41:40.375 --> 41:42.753
Fire, fire, fire!

41:42.878 --> 41:46.673
There's a fire, is there?

41:51.512 --> 41:52.971
Madam, come out
of here quickly!

41:53.096 --> 41:55.057
I'll take care
of the old gentleman!

41:57.059 --> 42:00.187
I can't breathe.

42:03.148 --> 42:03.941
It's a false alarm!

42:04.066 --> 42:07.694
It's a false alarm, look!

42:07.778 --> 42:10.739
It's a trick, it's a--
tell them--tell them!

42:10.864 --> 42:13.408
There's a fire!

42:15.744 --> 42:18.747
It's a false alarm,
do you hear?

42:18.872 --> 42:22.167
We do not need
the fire engine!

42:29.341 --> 42:32.928
What is it?

42:33.053 --> 42:34.513
It is a plumber's rocket, madam,

42:34.596 --> 42:38.058
one of my flock
is a plumber.

42:38.141 --> 42:39.476
It is ignited by a cap,

42:39.601 --> 42:43.730
and sends smoke into pipes
to betray cracks and holes.

42:43.814 --> 42:45.023
No, no, no, no, no,
it's all right.

42:45.107 --> 42:47.651
It will disperse.

42:47.776 --> 42:50.946
You said it was a trick.

42:51.071 --> 42:53.240
Who would play
such a trick on me?

42:53.323 --> 42:54.992
One of the gang, madam.

42:55.117 --> 42:57.911
But to what purpose?
I've escaped them.

42:58.036 --> 43:00.038
Revenge.

43:02.457 --> 43:06.086
Revenge?

43:06.170 --> 43:08.422
Are there such
wicked people?

43:08.547 --> 43:10.591
There are people
in this world, madam,

43:10.716 --> 43:16.138
to whom revenge is
in itself a reward.

43:16.263 --> 43:21.643
I cannot
imagine such feelings.

43:21.768 --> 43:24.938
I'm sure you cannot, madam.

43:25.063 --> 43:28.609
Well, I am
feeling more myself.

43:28.692 --> 43:32.196
I must be on my way.

43:32.321 --> 43:35.282
Oh, please stay,
some refreshment.

43:35.407 --> 43:37.784
Well, one of my flock
expects me.

43:37.868 --> 43:40.162
Won't you let
my carriage take you?

43:40.287 --> 43:43.582
Oh, no, no, no,
the air will aid my recovery.

43:43.665 --> 43:49.087
At least your name,
your address,

43:49.171 --> 43:51.423
that I may thank you
adequately.

43:51.507 --> 43:55.260
Well, I am just
a humble servant, madam,

43:55.344 --> 44:00.057
of the all seeing
providence.

44:00.182 --> 44:01.058
Goodnight.

44:06.688 --> 44:09.191
Goodnight.

44:26.792 --> 44:29.127
You did it
very nicely, Doctor.

44:29.211 --> 44:30.295
You have the photograph?

44:30.379 --> 44:32.381
No, but I know where it is.

44:32.506 --> 44:34.007
How did you find out?

44:34.132 --> 44:36.260
She showed me,
as I told you she would.

44:36.385 --> 44:38.387
The trouble is, it still remains
in her possession.

44:38.512 --> 44:40.848
You may have lost
your one chance, Holmes.

44:40.931 --> 44:42.266
No.

44:42.391 --> 44:44.852
I shall call
early tomorrow morning.

44:44.977 --> 44:46.019
You'll call there?

44:46.103 --> 44:48.730
And as my own self,
and with the King.

44:48.856 --> 44:49.314
The King?!

44:49.439 --> 44:51.650
And with you, Watson!

44:51.733 --> 44:54.736
You must be a witness
at the end of our quest.

45:21.555 --> 45:24.474
I trust you will sleep well
tonight for a change, Holmes.

45:24.600 --> 45:28.395
Well, there's nothing like
success for curing insomnia.

45:28.478 --> 45:32.566
Goodnight,
Mr. Sherlock Holmes,

45:32.691 --> 45:34.902
and Watson.

45:35.027 --> 45:35.944
Holmes?

45:49.541 --> 45:50.918
But she could not love him.

45:51.001 --> 45:52.419
I am in hopes
that she does.

45:52.503 --> 45:53.128
Why?

45:53.253 --> 45:54.338
Because it would
spare your Majesty

45:54.463 --> 45:56.256
all fear of future annoyance.

45:56.340 --> 45:59.760
If she loves her husband, then
she does not love your Majesty.

45:59.843 --> 46:01.178
And if she does not
love your Majesty,

46:01.303 --> 46:05.307
why should she interfere
with your Majesty's marriage.

46:11.730 --> 46:14.733
Mr. Sherlock Holmes,
I believe.

46:14.817 --> 46:16.401
I am Mr. Holmes.

46:16.485 --> 46:19.530
My mistress told me
you were likely to call.

46:19.655 --> 46:22.825
She left this morning with
her husband by the 5:15 train

46:22.950 --> 46:25.410
from Charing Cross
for the Continent.

46:25.536 --> 46:27.120
She has left England?

46:27.204 --> 46:29.623
Never to return, sir.

46:29.706 --> 46:31.583
All is lost.

46:48.267 --> 46:50.561
Well then, get at it.

46:58.026 --> 46:59.778
This is not it!

46:59.862 --> 47:06.869
Holmes, this is
a different photograph!

47:12.583 --> 47:17.296
Do you hear me, man?!

47:17.379 --> 47:20.507
The letter.

47:20.591 --> 47:24.720
It is addressed to me.

47:24.845 --> 47:31.101
"My Dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes:
You did it very well.

47:31.226 --> 47:32.186
You took me in completely.

47:32.269 --> 47:35.606
Until after the alarm of fire,
I had not a suspicion.

47:35.731 --> 47:38.150
But then, when I found
that I had betrayed myself,

47:38.233 --> 47:39.276
it flashed into my mind

47:39.401 --> 47:42.196
that I had been warned
against you months ago.

47:42.279 --> 47:44.740
I had been told that if
the King employed an agent

47:44.865 --> 47:46.074
it would certainly be you.

47:46.200 --> 47:47.493
Yet, with all this,

47:47.576 --> 47:50.621
you made me reveal
what you wanted to know.

47:50.746 --> 47:53.081
Even before when the presence
of so many people in the street

47:53.207 --> 47:56.043
had sounded an alarm
in my instinct,

47:56.168 --> 48:01.590
I could not think evil of such
a dear, kind old clergyman.

48:03.509 --> 48:05.427
But, you know,

48:05.511 --> 48:08.430
I have been trained
as an actress myself,

48:08.555 --> 48:11.808
and male costume
is nothing new to me.

48:11.934 --> 48:16.230
Yes, it was I who followed you
to your door,

48:16.355 --> 48:16.855
just to make sure

48:16.939 --> 48:21.693
that you really were the
celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

48:21.777 --> 48:26.532
It was I who rather imprudently,
wished you goodnight.

48:26.615 --> 48:30.035
Then I started for the Temple
to see my new husband.

48:30.118 --> 48:31.328
We had married in secret

48:31.453 --> 48:35.249
in case we needed to leave
the country to elude the King.

48:35.332 --> 48:39.294
Your appearance on the scene
was the signal for flight.

48:39.378 --> 48:44.633
You are too formidable
an antagonist.

48:49.012 --> 48:52.641
You will find the nest empty
when you call tomorrow.

48:52.766 --> 48:58.939
As to the photograph,
your client may rest in peace.

48:59.064 --> 49:06.238
I love and am loved
by a better man than he."

49:09.867 --> 49:13.620
"The King may"--

49:21.211 --> 49:22.754
"The King may do
what he will

49:22.838 --> 49:27.509
without hindrance from one
whom he has cruelly wronged.

49:27.634 --> 49:30.304
I kept it only
to safeguard myself,

49:30.387 --> 49:33.974
and to preserve a weapon
which will always secure me

49:34.099 --> 49:38.478
from any steps
he may take."

49:55.621 --> 49:57.623
There is more.

49:57.706 --> 50:02.836
"I leave another photograph
which he might care to possess;

50:02.920 --> 50:04.796
and I remain,
dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,

50:04.880 --> 50:11.845
very truly yours,
Irena Norton, nee Adler."

50:14.097 --> 50:17.851
What a woman!

50:17.976 --> 50:22.773
What a queen
she would have made!

50:22.898 --> 50:27.444
Is it not a pity
she was not on my level.

50:30.239 --> 50:31.198
From what I have seen
of the lady,

50:31.281 --> 50:34.868
yes, indeed, she is on a very
different level to your Majesty.

50:34.952 --> 50:39.581
I am only so sorry that I have
failed in my commission.

50:39.706 --> 50:41.416
On the contrary,
my dear sir,

50:41.542 --> 50:44.169
nothing could be
more successful.

50:44.253 --> 50:46.839
I know that her word
is inviolate.

50:46.922 --> 50:50.551
The photograph is now as safe
as if it were in the fire.

50:50.676 --> 50:53.095
I am glad that
your Majesty thinks so.

50:53.220 --> 50:54.429
I am immensely
indebted to you.

50:54.555 --> 50:58.684
Pray, tell me in
what way I can reward you.

51:00.435 --> 51:02.354
This ring?

51:08.152 --> 51:09.528
Your Majesty has something

51:09.611 --> 51:12.156
which I should value
even more highly.

51:12.281 --> 51:17.202
You have but to name it.

51:17.327 --> 51:19.580
This.

51:19.663 --> 51:21.623
Irena's photograph?

51:21.748 --> 51:24.793
Certainly,
if you wish it.

51:24.918 --> 51:25.627
Then I have the honor

51:25.752 --> 51:29.673
to wish your Majesty
a very good morning.

51:38.182 --> 51:40.767
And that was
how a great scandal

51:40.893 --> 51:43.520
threatened the Kingdom
of Bohemia,

51:43.645 --> 51:46.940
and how the best plans
of Mr. Sherlock Holmes

51:47.024 --> 51:50.861
were beaten
by a woman's wit.

51:50.986 --> 51:53.447
He used to sneer much
at the cleverness of women,

51:53.572 --> 51:56.074
but I have not heard him
do it of late.

51:56.158 --> 51:58.994
And when he speaks
of Irena Adler,

51:59.119 --> 52:00.537
or when he refers
to that woman,

52:00.662 --> 52:06.710
it is always under the honorable
title of "the woman."

52:06.835 --> 52:10.839
In his eyes, she eclipses
the whole of her sex.

52:10.964 --> 52:13.550
It was not that he ever
betrayed any sign of love

52:13.675 --> 52:15.135
for Irena Adler,

52:15.260 --> 52:17.179
all emotions
such as that one

52:17.304 --> 52:21.266
are abhorrent to
his cold, precise mind.

52:21.350 --> 52:24.770
He only looks on women
pathologically,

52:24.853 --> 52:27.981
as the source
of motives, clues.

52:28.065 --> 52:35.739
And yet, he keeps her
photograph apart, locked up.

52:35.864 --> 52:39.535
There is but
one woman to him,

52:39.660 --> 52:48.794
the beautiful Irena Adler, of
dubious and questionable memory.
