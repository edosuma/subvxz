00:01.523 --> 00:03.524
It's your fault,
Normandy 1944,

00:03.526 --> 00:04.825
<i>Allied invasion.</i>

00:04.827 --> 00:06.921
<i>You were on French soil</i>
<i>when it happened.</i>

00:09.032 --> 00:10.331
Carentan?

00:10.333 --> 00:11.666
Carentan
is a very bad place.

00:11.668 --> 00:14.787
Why don't we just attack
this weather device?

00:14.789 --> 00:16.068
If we simply blow it up,

00:16.070 --> 00:16.939
the creature they're using
to power it

00:16.941 --> 00:18.601
could do massive damage.

00:18.603 --> 00:20.736
There's no way to really
kill a fire elemental.

00:20.738 --> 00:22.567
Is there a way
that you can force down?

00:30.906 --> 00:32.143
I appreciate it, Ravi,
thank you.

00:32.145 --> 00:33.681
I need you to visit
the Mumbai Sanctuary.

00:33.683 --> 00:35.717
Ravi is the head of house.

00:35.719 --> 00:36.786
Dr. Zimmerman,

00:36.788 --> 00:38.693
Ms. Freelander,
namaste.

00:38.695 --> 00:39.694
Call me Ravi.

00:39.696 --> 00:41.663
He pretty much
saved my life,

00:41.665 --> 00:42.797
twice.

00:42.799 --> 00:44.536
Will!

00:44.538 --> 00:45.671
What happened?

00:45.673 --> 00:46.705
Unbelievable!

00:53.151 --> 00:54.488
Did you say Carentan?

00:54.490 --> 00:55.823
In Normandy?

00:55.825 --> 00:57.058
<i>Yeah, I thought</i>
<i>it might ring a bell.</i>

00:57.060 --> 00:58.093
It does indeed.

00:58.095 --> 00:59.496
How many are missing?

00:59.498 --> 01:00.864
<i>Well, it's hard</i>
<i>to say exactly.</i>

01:00.866 --> 01:02.566
<i>There's a media blackout,</i>

01:02.568 --> 01:04.902
<i>and my usual sources</i>
<i>are strangely silent.</i>

01:04.904 --> 01:06.837
<i>You have the partial</i>
<i>list there.</i>

01:06.839 --> 01:09.173
Yeah, uh, a local farmer...

01:09.175 --> 01:11.075
<i>And his livestock.</i>

01:11.077 --> 01:13.110
A couple of
backpacking tourists,

01:13.112 --> 01:14.778
and a busload
of senior citizens.

01:14.780 --> 01:15.946
All disappeared without a trace

01:15.948 --> 01:18.149
within a ten-kilometer radius
of Carentan.

01:18.151 --> 01:19.519
<i>And no word from</i>
<i>any of the residents?</i>

01:19.521 --> 01:22.257
No response
to phone calls or emails,

01:22.259 --> 01:24.494
not even from the local police,

01:24.496 --> 01:26.196
and did you see
that sat-link I sent you?

01:26.198 --> 01:27.598
Yeah, I'm calling it up now.

01:29.267 --> 01:30.702
Censored?

01:30.704 --> 01:32.538
By whom?

01:32.540 --> 01:33.872
<i>There's the rub.</i>

01:33.874 --> 01:35.876
And Ravi went in five days ago?

01:35.878 --> 01:37.044
He was already in Paris

01:37.046 --> 01:38.113
wrapping up
the Bipedal Conference,

01:38.115 --> 01:39.348
so I figured--

01:39.350 --> 01:40.750
No, absolutely,
you made the right call.

01:40.752 --> 01:42.553
<i>I discovered</i>
<i>he was sending a video log</i>

01:42.555 --> 01:44.588
<i>back to his computer</i>
<i>at the Mumbai Sanctuary.</i>

01:44.590 --> 01:46.290
<i>I called up</i>
<i>his last post.</i>

01:46.292 --> 01:48.560
<i>Take a look at this.</i>

01:48.562 --> 01:50.195
<i>I'm inside the</i>
<i>first checkpoint now,</i>

01:50.197 --> 01:51.530
<i>and I think I'm getting closer</i>

01:51.532 --> 01:52.832
<i>to the perimeter</i>
<i>of the disturbance.</i>

01:52.834 --> 01:55.636
<i>According to my estimates,</i>
<i>it's within...</i>

01:55.638 --> 01:58.106
<i>I'm feeling a strange</i>
<i>tingling sensation--</i>

01:59.308 --> 02:00.675
<i>Since then,</i>

02:00.677 --> 02:01.777
nothing.

02:01.779 --> 02:03.279
<i>All contact was</i>
<i>instantly lost.</i>

02:03.281 --> 02:05.315
It was like he disappeared
off the face of the planet.

<i>Bastards!</i>

02:22.924 --> 02:24.419
That answers my question.

02:24.420 --> 02:25.586
The French government,
now Interpol.

02:25.959 --> 02:27.192
Complete stonewall.

02:27.194 --> 02:28.159
I know the feeling.

02:28.161 --> 02:28.994
C.I.A.?

02:28.996 --> 02:30.495
<i>Schtum</i> . MI-6?

02:30.497 --> 02:31.863
Waiting for a call back.

02:31.865 --> 02:32.831
I've got a bridge
I want to sell you.

02:32.833 --> 02:34.165
Precisely.

02:34.167 --> 02:35.567
Are you getting
the feeling

02:35.569 --> 02:36.969
we've been kicked
out of the treehouse here?

02:36.971 --> 02:37.936
It's like all our
reciprocal agreements

02:37.938 --> 02:39.070
have been rescinded
overnight.

02:39.072 --> 02:40.905
Which means whatever's
happening in Carentan

02:40.907 --> 02:42.607
must be terrifying
the hell out of them.

02:44.281 --> 02:45.681
<i>I've just come from</i>

02:45.683 --> 02:46.615
<i>the regional Magistrate's</i>
<i>office.</i>

02:46.617 --> 02:48.317
<i>Like blood from a stone,</i>

02:48.319 --> 02:51.020
<i>and apparently</i>
<i>the Surete now wants me</i>

02:51.022 --> 02:52.422
<i>to leave the country</i>
<i>within 12 hours,</i>

02:52.424 --> 02:53.723
<i>which, of course,</i>

02:53.725 --> 02:57.161
<i>only makes me</i>
<i>more determined to stay.</i>

02:57.163 --> 02:58.395
<i>I'm inside</i>
<i>the first checkpoint now,</i>

02:58.397 --> 02:59.730
<i>and I think</i>
<i>I'm getting closer</i>

02:59.732 --> 03:01.532
<i>to the perimeter</i>
<i>of the disturbance.</i>

03:01.534 --> 03:04.302
<i>According to my estimates,</i>
<i>it's within...</i>

03:04.304 --> 03:07.405
<i>I'm feeling a strange</i>
<i>tingling sensation--</i>

03:07.407 --> 03:09.073
Any abnormal
you heard of

03:09.075 --> 03:11.109
discharge energy
like that?

03:11.111 --> 03:12.644
Several, but they leave
radiation signatures

03:12.646 --> 03:14.112
in the atmosphere,

03:14.114 --> 03:16.248
and we don't have
any spikes in that area.

03:16.250 --> 03:17.582
Gulfstream's on standby.

03:17.584 --> 03:18.684
You ready?

03:18.686 --> 03:20.185
Almost.

03:20.187 --> 03:22.087
This would go a lot faster
with Hank's help, by the way,

03:22.089 --> 03:24.155
but apparently they don't
have phones in sweat lodges.

03:24.157 --> 03:26.224
That's the last time
we give him the weekend off

03:26.226 --> 03:28.626
to commune with his inner wolf.

03:30.363 --> 03:32.062
Okay, so we used
the background landscape

03:32.064 --> 03:33.163
from Ravi's video...

03:33.165 --> 03:35.598
And the towers the cell
signal bounced off...

03:35.600 --> 03:37.399
To geo-map
his last location, nice.

03:37.401 --> 03:38.367
Exactly.

03:38.369 --> 03:40.336
Oh, we got a hit.

03:40.338 --> 03:42.304
Looks like a couple miles
from the town center.

03:42.306 --> 03:44.073
Okay, so if Ravi did
find a way in,

03:44.075 --> 03:45.574
that would be our access point.

03:45.576 --> 03:47.509
Stay sharp.

03:49.346 --> 03:50.245
...And have
the TAC team standing by,

03:50.247 --> 03:51.914
just in case.

03:51.916 --> 03:53.549
<i>They're ready and waiting</i>
<i>at Plymouth Naval Base.</i>

03:53.551 --> 03:54.984
<i>It's just a 30-minute hop</i>
<i>across the channel, if need be.</i>

03:54.986 --> 03:56.619
Good.
I'm leaving now.

03:56.621 --> 03:57.953
<i>I'll meet you there.</i>

03:57.955 --> 03:59.388
Ah...

03:59.390 --> 04:01.057
Do you think
that's wise?

04:01.059 --> 04:02.725
We're already down
one Sanctuary head.

04:02.727 --> 04:04.059
Until I know what
we're dealing with--

04:04.061 --> 04:06.094
<i>I was the one</i>
<i>who sent Ravi in there.</i>

04:06.096 --> 04:07.696
<i>I'm responsible.</i>

04:07.698 --> 04:10.699
<i>So with all due respect, Guv,</i>
<i>I'll see you at De Gaulle.</i>

04:12.402 --> 04:14.969
Cheeky bugger.

04:16.000 --> 04:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:32.353 --> 04:34.488
So, 65 years later...

04:34.490 --> 04:35.756
Look a little different

04:35.758 --> 04:37.559
without the barbed wire
and swastikas?

04:37.561 --> 04:40.095
Ever so slightly.

04:40.097 --> 04:41.663
Heads up.

04:55.177 --> 04:56.544
What's the situation here?

04:56.546 --> 04:57.646
Industrial spill.

04:57.648 --> 04:59.714
We're asking everybody
to turn back.

04:59.716 --> 05:01.082
But I believe
one of my colleagues--

05:01.084 --> 05:02.250
Sorry, ma'am,
until clean-up is complete,

05:02.252 --> 05:03.285
the area is off-limits.

05:04.421 --> 05:05.720
Oh, bumpy roads...

05:05.722 --> 05:07.222
You're not going to
get carsick again?

05:07.224 --> 05:08.656
She's been very,
very sick.

05:08.658 --> 05:09.724
Oh, God...

05:09.726 --> 05:10.692
She's been
really sick.

05:17.398 --> 05:19.032
Nicely done.

05:25.607 --> 05:27.041
<i>Arretez!</i>

05:29.278 --> 05:31.145
Who's in charge here?

05:32.648 --> 05:33.782
I am.

05:33.784 --> 05:35.717
Dr. Magnus...

05:38.722 --> 05:39.722
Inside.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.859
Just you.

05:51.734 --> 05:53.368
You know who I am.

05:53.370 --> 05:54.436
Let's just say

05:54.438 --> 05:56.238
your reputation
precedes you.

05:56.240 --> 05:58.306
Wish I could say
the same about you.

05:58.308 --> 06:00.141
I don't have a name,

06:00.143 --> 06:01.375
not as far
as you're concerned.

06:01.377 --> 06:02.610
Right, then.

06:02.612 --> 06:04.779
Let's cut to the chase,
shall we?

06:04.781 --> 06:07.482
This Hazmat
dog-and-pony show is a joke.

06:07.484 --> 06:09.784
If there was a real
radiation risk,

06:09.786 --> 06:11.419
you and your boys
would be suited up.

06:11.421 --> 06:12.354
Atmospherics
from the area

06:12.356 --> 06:14.189
came back clean as a whistle.

06:14.191 --> 06:16.225
No large industries
for over a hundred kilometers.

06:16.227 --> 06:18.127
Oh, and, by the way,

06:18.129 --> 06:21.598
you've got at least
two trucks outside

06:21.600 --> 06:23.266
full of
surface-to-air missiles.

06:23.268 --> 06:25.569
<i>Starstreaks</i> ,
if I'm not mistaken.

06:25.571 --> 06:27.270
Now, I had no idea

06:27.272 --> 06:29.472
they could be used
to clean up a toxic spill.

06:29.474 --> 06:31.140
You know the only reason
you're still alive

06:31.142 --> 06:32.608
is because of who you are?

06:32.610 --> 06:34.843
And I'm not leaving
until I get some answers.

06:34.845 --> 06:36.478
Now, one of my colleagues--

06:36.480 --> 06:37.745
Ravi Ganapathiraman?

06:37.747 --> 06:39.814
Have you seen him?

06:39.816 --> 06:43.283
Six days ago.

06:43.285 --> 06:45.452
Like you, he was stopped
at our first checkpoint,

06:45.454 --> 06:47.387
and he was ordered to turn back.

06:47.389 --> 06:48.789
But he didn't.

06:52.593 --> 06:53.660
Is he alive?

06:56.698 --> 06:58.365
Take your people, leave.

06:58.367 --> 07:00.400
Now.

07:00.402 --> 07:02.136
You know who I am,

07:02.138 --> 07:03.804
therefore you know what I do.

07:03.806 --> 07:06.640
Whatever's going on here,
maybe I can help.

07:06.642 --> 07:09.543
This is above
your pay grade, doctor.

07:11.245 --> 07:13.313
Yeah, even you.

07:22.323 --> 07:24.257
Well, whoever he is,
he's clearly ex-military.

07:24.259 --> 07:25.692
He's not French army.

07:25.694 --> 07:28.162
Yeah, generic uniforms,
no markings on the vehicles.

07:28.164 --> 07:29.196
Some sort of private

07:29.198 --> 07:30.598
international
security force.

07:30.600 --> 07:31.733
Yet he's clearly acting

07:31.735 --> 07:32.867
with the approval
of the French government,

07:32.869 --> 07:35.337
and yet his mandate's
being rigorously shielded

07:35.339 --> 07:37.606
by intelligence agencies
worldwide.

07:37.608 --> 07:38.940
Well, something very big
and very bad

07:38.942 --> 07:40.742
is going on inside that town.

07:40.744 --> 07:41.844
Something no government

07:41.846 --> 07:43.312
wants to take
responsibility for.

07:43.314 --> 07:46.348
And yet all governments
want to cover up.

07:46.350 --> 07:48.517
That field, those trees.

07:48.519 --> 07:49.551
Pull over.

07:49.553 --> 07:52.654
I wonder if it's still there.

07:53.956 --> 07:56.824
A tunnel from the war.

07:56.826 --> 07:59.793
It leads under the field,

07:59.795 --> 08:02.829
and if memory serves,
should end beyond the base camp.

08:02.831 --> 08:04.564
Looks like
somebody used it recently.

08:04.566 --> 08:06.833
It must be how Ravi bypassed
perimeter security.

08:06.835 --> 08:07.734
Well, how did he
know about it?

08:07.736 --> 08:09.302
Well, it's in my old logs.

08:09.304 --> 08:10.771
It could've come up if he did
a Carentan search.

08:10.773 --> 08:13.641
Now, you two,

08:13.643 --> 08:15.309
until we know
what we're dealing with,

08:15.311 --> 08:16.911
I'm not willing to endanger
the entire team.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.446
Aw, come on.

08:18.448 --> 08:19.381
I could argue there's
strength in numbers.

08:19.383 --> 08:20.349
I'm sure you could,

08:20.351 --> 08:21.583
but not this time.

08:23.620 --> 08:25.888
I guess
I'll go first.

08:25.890 --> 08:28.357
Don't even think
about following.

08:41.602 --> 08:42.803
Check our coordinates.

08:42.804 --> 08:44.203
Yeah.

08:44.206 --> 08:48.342
Okay, GPS says we're now
behind enemy lines.

08:48.344 --> 08:52.280
The perimeter camp
is back that way.

08:53.815 --> 08:54.849
Shh!

08:55.951 --> 08:57.685
Listen.

08:59.955 --> 09:01.490
It's so quiet.

09:01.492 --> 09:02.791
Exactly.

09:02.793 --> 09:05.927
Not even any birds.

09:05.929 --> 09:09.397
The town's that way,
beyond the treeline.

09:20.877 --> 09:22.777
What the hell
just happened?

09:24.047 --> 09:25.580
Do you hear it?

09:25.582 --> 09:28.849
Yeah.

09:29.851 --> 09:31.452
Hey.

09:35.490 --> 09:38.591
Hello.

09:38.593 --> 09:40.693
<i>Anglais.</i>

09:40.695 --> 09:41.727
Newcomers.

09:41.729 --> 09:43.596
You were right.

09:43.598 --> 09:44.530
You from Carentan?

09:44.532 --> 09:46.933
<i>Oui.</i>

09:46.935 --> 09:48.468
Come with us.

09:48.470 --> 09:50.704
The last one will be
very excited to meet you.

10:19.101 --> 10:20.834
Check it out,

10:20.836 --> 10:22.803
the whole town's
gone green.

10:22.805 --> 10:24.871
It's not quite
as I remember it.

10:24.873 --> 10:26.473
I'm not sure
what I expected,

10:26.475 --> 10:27.708
but it certainly
wasn't this.

10:28.843 --> 10:30.845
I don't understand.

10:30.847 --> 10:32.847
Something's not right.

10:32.849 --> 10:34.015
Here he is.

10:34.017 --> 10:35.950
The last one.

10:39.121 --> 10:41.122
Helen, Will...

10:41.124 --> 10:42.857
Ravi!

10:45.952 --> 10:49.251
Helen, even though it's only
been six days for you,

10:49.351 --> 10:51.651
I'm now 74 years old.

10:51.653 --> 10:53.486
My mind says
it's not possible,

10:53.488 --> 10:54.454
and yet...

10:54.456 --> 10:55.655
I look at you.

10:55.657 --> 10:58.025
Um, I'm sorry, Ravi.

10:58.027 --> 11:00.327
My brain is still
playing catch-up here.

11:00.329 --> 11:03.831
You say that you arrived
in Carentan six days ago?

11:03.833 --> 11:05.633
In your time.

11:05.635 --> 11:08.836
But in this village,
40 years has passed.

11:08.838 --> 11:10.071
In "dome-time,"

11:10.073 --> 11:11.672
or at least,
that's what I call it.

11:11.674 --> 11:13.641
It's a massive
time dilation field,

11:13.643 --> 11:15.576
and you can't leave?

11:15.578 --> 11:17.645
Anyone who tries to pass
through the boundary

11:17.647 --> 11:19.046
and re-enter
the normal time stream

11:19.048 --> 11:20.748
is killed instantly.

11:20.750 --> 11:22.716
There's an intense
dimensional recoil.

11:22.718 --> 11:24.685
It's like being hit by a train.

11:25.887 --> 11:27.922
So we're trapped

11:27.924 --> 11:29.990
inside an invisible
time dome...

11:29.992 --> 11:31.692
In France.

11:31.694 --> 11:33.827
Awkward,

11:33.829 --> 11:36.597
but it does explain a lot.

11:36.599 --> 11:37.998
Oh, yeah, it makes
complete sense.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.401
Come with me.

11:40.403 --> 11:42.803
There's someone
I want you to meet.

11:42.805 --> 11:44.905
Anna!

11:47.609 --> 11:49.943
Newcomers.

11:49.945 --> 11:51.545
Welcome.

11:52.680 --> 11:54.081
Helen, Will,

11:54.083 --> 11:57.351
this is my wife, Anna.

12:03.758 --> 12:07.394
This used to be
an old Nazi bunker.

12:07.396 --> 12:08.662
Fond memories.

12:08.664 --> 12:09.930
Of course.

12:09.932 --> 12:11.765
But as I was saying,

12:11.767 --> 12:14.434
the time stream first erupted
just over three weeks ago

12:14.436 --> 12:15.769
your time.

12:15.771 --> 12:18.705
The epicenter was in
a cave off the cliffs.

12:18.707 --> 12:19.973
That's when the
disappearances started.

12:19.975 --> 12:21.174
The French government thought

12:21.176 --> 12:22.876
they had a Bermuda Triangle
on their hands,

12:22.878 --> 12:24.112
so at first
they sent in scientists.

12:24.114 --> 12:25.980
Who never returned.

12:25.982 --> 12:28.383
Then they sent in
the military,

12:28.385 --> 12:29.685
who also never returned,

12:29.687 --> 12:30.786
and then, no one.

12:30.788 --> 12:32.621
Until you...

12:32.623 --> 12:33.756
The last one.

12:33.758 --> 12:35.992
The rest, as they say,
is history.

12:35.994 --> 12:37.527
Literally.

12:37.529 --> 12:38.528
So all this equipment...

12:38.530 --> 12:39.663
Was already here,

12:39.665 --> 12:41.597
or brought in since.

12:41.599 --> 12:43.032
Previous experiments?

12:43.034 --> 12:44.500
The result of over
100 years of research

12:44.502 --> 12:46.002
by top scientists
in France

12:46.004 --> 12:47.303
and the military,

12:47.305 --> 12:49.672
trying to understand
the time stream,

12:49.674 --> 12:52.575
trying to solve it, dissolve it,

12:52.577 --> 12:53.676
and yet...

12:53.678 --> 12:54.910
Here we are.

12:56.413 --> 12:57.546
God, I can't believe it.

12:57.548 --> 12:59.881
What?

12:59.883 --> 13:01.950
I destroyed a massive
fire elemental

13:01.952 --> 13:04.753
back in 1944.

13:04.755 --> 13:07.890
Drove it into the Earth
less than half a mile from here,

13:07.892 --> 13:09.025
and now this?

13:10.928 --> 13:12.162
You don't think
this is your fault?

13:12.164 --> 13:14.398
Well, it can't be
a coincidence.

13:14.400 --> 13:15.766
I have to admit,

13:15.768 --> 13:17.669
the thought did occur to me,

13:17.671 --> 13:19.704
but I haven't been able
to find a connection.

13:22.642 --> 13:24.609
Anna told me we had newcomers.

13:24.611 --> 13:25.911
Josie, Helen, Will.

13:25.913 --> 13:28.046
Josie is
the granddaughter

13:28.048 --> 13:30.848
of the first French scientist
to enter Carentan.

13:30.850 --> 13:32.950
An excellent assistant.

13:32.952 --> 13:36.020
She's also a natural
at mathematics.

13:36.022 --> 13:37.455
I also make sure

13:37.457 --> 13:38.956
he does not forget
to eat his lunch.

13:40.059 --> 13:41.692
Of course.

13:41.694 --> 13:43.594
Let's go, Anna hates it
when I'm late.

13:44.863 --> 13:46.130
So easy to lose track of time

13:46.132 --> 13:49.700
when there's
three years of daylight.

13:54.039 --> 13:55.340
So one day of our time

13:55.342 --> 13:57.709
is equal to six years
inside Carentan.

13:57.711 --> 13:59.211
Three years
of daylight,

13:59.213 --> 14:01.046
followed by
three years of night.

14:01.048 --> 14:02.214
The dark time.

14:02.216 --> 14:03.282
Your 12-hour cycle

14:03.284 --> 14:05.017
translated into
our years.

14:05.019 --> 14:07.520
We're cut off, remember,
from the outside world,

14:07.522 --> 14:10.189
so we have to stockpile
all our resources.

14:10.191 --> 14:11.457
Food from
the harvests.

14:11.459 --> 14:12.991
Energy from
the solar panels,

14:12.993 --> 14:14.693
but it is
never enough.

14:14.695 --> 14:16.895
The stores of energy
are the first to go.

14:16.897 --> 14:19.598
Then the food runs out.

14:19.600 --> 14:22.234
The last few months...

14:22.236 --> 14:24.102
Only the youngest

14:24.104 --> 14:25.036
and the strongest

14:25.038 --> 14:26.471
make it through to the sunrise.

14:28.574 --> 14:30.008
How long
until the next dark time?

14:30.010 --> 14:31.109
Nine months, in dome time.

14:31.111 --> 14:32.577
But out there...

14:32.579 --> 14:34.679
Less than three hours.

14:38.184 --> 14:39.784
What if they don't come back?

14:39.786 --> 14:41.486
They will.

14:43.089 --> 14:45.190
Yeah, but what if
they don't?

14:45.192 --> 14:47.626
Then we'll go in
after them.

14:47.628 --> 14:49.161
What if we don't come back?

14:49.163 --> 14:52.865
Well, then at least
we'll be in there.

14:53.935 --> 14:54.901
This is pointless.

14:54.903 --> 14:56.101
You heard Magnus.

14:56.103 --> 14:57.436
Yeah, she said
"don't go in the tunnel."

14:57.438 --> 14:58.804
Right.

14:58.806 --> 14:59.905
But that doesn't mean
we're supposed to sit around

14:59.907 --> 15:00.773
with our thumb up--

15:00.775 --> 15:02.041
What is your point?

15:02.043 --> 15:04.877
My point is,
we're learning nothing here.

15:09.982 --> 15:11.749
Let's go.

15:13.052 --> 15:13.985
Freeze!

15:13.987 --> 15:15.052
Stay right there.

15:15.054 --> 15:18.822
Aw, crap...

15:18.824 --> 15:21.225
Your colleagues
did a very stupid thing.

15:21.227 --> 15:22.960
They may be lost forever.

15:22.962 --> 15:24.729
Look, you know
what's going on,

15:24.731 --> 15:25.697
so just tell us.

15:28.735 --> 15:29.768
Maybe he doesn't know.

15:31.037 --> 15:32.238
Maybe no one knows

15:32.240 --> 15:34.173
what's happening
in Carentan.

15:35.876 --> 15:37.644
Impound their vehicle,
put them in the supply tent.

15:37.646 --> 15:38.779
Sir.

15:38.781 --> 15:40.113
Let's go.

15:46.054 --> 15:49.224
Some of this handwriting
is practically indecipherable.

15:49.226 --> 15:50.892
A combination
of poor penmanship

15:50.894 --> 15:52.660
and homemade inks.

15:52.662 --> 15:54.862
French, German, English.

15:54.864 --> 15:56.830
Was none of this research
computerized?

15:56.832 --> 15:58.064
At first,

15:58.066 --> 16:00.333
but then they realized
how risky that was.

16:00.335 --> 16:04.204
Hard drives weren't built
to last 150 years.

16:05.841 --> 16:08.809
I barely feel like
I've made a dent at all.

16:08.811 --> 16:10.612
You've only
been at it a week.

16:10.614 --> 16:12.847
Give yourself time.

16:12.849 --> 16:14.016
Time...

16:14.018 --> 16:15.317
Time dilation.

16:16.586 --> 16:18.121
Adam Worth
and the time nodes.

16:18.123 --> 16:20.090
Yet this can't
have been his doing.

16:20.092 --> 16:21.725
He died months ago
in Hollow Earth.

16:21.727 --> 16:24.827
In all my years here,

16:24.829 --> 16:27.630
I've explored every square inch
of the boundary.

16:27.632 --> 16:29.098
There's no device anywhere.

16:35.772 --> 16:37.939
Do you never
feel like giving up?

16:37.941 --> 16:40.209
Just quitting?

16:40.211 --> 16:42.845
Every day.

16:42.847 --> 16:43.979
What keeps you going?

16:43.981 --> 16:45.714
You.

16:49.919 --> 16:51.887
I wanted to see
the look on your face

16:51.889 --> 16:53.388
when I cracked this mother.

16:58.928 --> 17:01.130
Well, let's get to
it, then, shall we?

17:05.336 --> 17:07.136
You take these
readings every week?

17:07.137 --> 17:09.805
The dome's like
a living thing.

17:09.807 --> 17:11.906
We're taking
its pulse.

17:11.909 --> 17:14.041
Looking for a weakening
in the energy.

17:14.044 --> 17:17.846
Have you ever found any?

17:17.848 --> 17:19.647
If it's so dangerous
to penetrate the dome,

17:19.650 --> 17:21.249
yet you can't see it,

17:21.251 --> 17:22.584
how do you...

17:22.586 --> 17:25.854
Careful, now,
we are close.

17:27.423 --> 17:29.190
Slowly.

17:34.364 --> 17:35.664
Yeah, I-I feel it.

17:35.666 --> 17:39.801
It's like
my skin is tingling.

17:39.803 --> 17:43.038
If we kept walking,
it would intensify.

17:43.040 --> 17:45.273
Let me show you.

17:58.689 --> 18:00.123
Another three meters, and...

18:02.827 --> 18:05.328
I saw it happen once.

18:07.064 --> 18:12.135
A young man,
just before dark time.

18:12.137 --> 18:15.004
He started screaming

18:15.006 --> 18:19.909
and ran, and ran,
and just...

18:19.911 --> 18:23.313
Blew apart.

18:23.315 --> 18:25.349
Hey...

18:25.351 --> 18:28.486
Don't think about that.

18:28.488 --> 18:31.088
There's gotta be
another way out, right?

18:35.093 --> 18:36.026
What?

18:37.296 --> 18:40.832
It's just, I was born here.

18:40.834 --> 18:43.935
This is the only world
I have ever known.

18:46.038 --> 18:47.839
There's a hell
of a lot more world

18:47.841 --> 18:50.109
outside of Carentan.

18:50.111 --> 18:51.978
You're gonna love it.

19:01.487 --> 19:02.821
Thanks.

19:02.823 --> 19:05.090
Nice bathrooms
you got there.

19:05.092 --> 19:07.893
Just keep moving.

19:07.895 --> 19:10.897
You know, it was real sweet
of you to wait for me.

19:12.333 --> 19:13.166
Get inside.

19:14.269 --> 19:16.871
Okay.

19:27.883 --> 19:30.418
Of course
I trust you.

19:30.420 --> 19:31.719
It's just that

19:31.721 --> 19:33.488
there are only two
functioning motherboards left.

19:33.490 --> 19:35.090
I can't give
any guarantees.

19:35.092 --> 19:36.491
But it is a chance

19:36.493 --> 19:38.293
to communicate
with the outside world.

19:38.295 --> 19:40.929
And on a frequency
we know will be monitored.

19:40.931 --> 19:42.064
But previous
transmissions

19:42.066 --> 19:43.266
have never
been answered.

19:43.268 --> 19:44.500
That's because of
the time differential.

19:44.502 --> 19:46.869
When a signal broadcast
from inside the dome

19:46.871 --> 19:48.237
is received on the outside,

19:48.239 --> 19:50.406
it's incredibly condensed.

19:50.408 --> 19:52.275
We're talking hundredths
of a nanosecond.

19:52.277 --> 19:54.377
It would barely register
on the most sensitive equipment.

19:54.379 --> 19:56.279
Which is why I'm
stretching out this signal,

19:56.281 --> 19:57.581
slowing it down.

19:57.583 --> 20:00.551
Even a simple message like,
"we are alive.

20:00.553 --> 20:02.319
Time dilation field."

20:02.321 --> 20:04.187
Will take up two weeks
to transmit.

20:04.189 --> 20:05.955
And we're going to need
uninterrupted power.

20:05.957 --> 20:08.124
I've dedicated
one of the solar panels.

20:08.126 --> 20:11.227
All set, then.

20:13.164 --> 20:15.030
I know they've only
been gone half an hour,

20:15.032 --> 20:17.165
but this whole set-up
gives me the creeps.

20:17.167 --> 20:18.399
Yeah, me too.

20:18.401 --> 20:20.501
I've got your location now.

20:20.503 --> 20:23.905
Also, there's a strong
satellite transmission

20:23.907 --> 20:24.973
coming from the same area.

20:24.975 --> 20:26.875
The command tent.

20:26.877 --> 20:28.210
Can you eavesdrop?

20:28.212 --> 20:29.545
<i>Signal's scrambled.</i>

20:29.547 --> 20:31.314
No surprise.

20:31.316 --> 20:33.350
<i>One more thing.</i>

20:33.352 --> 20:35.885
Just before your call came in,
I picked up something odd.

20:35.887 --> 20:37.220
<i>Specifically?</i>

20:37.222 --> 20:40.224
Short bursts of static,
like screeching white noise.

20:40.226 --> 20:41.358
Interference?

20:41.360 --> 20:42.426
<i>Yeah, could be.</i>

20:42.428 --> 20:43.861
I'll look into it.

21:00.382 --> 21:02.516
Ravi's asking that
the solar panels

21:02.518 --> 21:05.653
be re-routed back
to the battery stores.

21:05.655 --> 21:07.521
Uh-huh.

21:10.559 --> 21:12.460
You know,
it's been three weeks

21:12.462 --> 21:14.495
since our S.O.S. call.

21:14.497 --> 21:17.031
Yes, I know.

21:17.033 --> 21:19.366
If the outside hasn't
responded by now--

21:19.368 --> 21:22.203
I'm fully aware of
the situation, thank you.

21:28.945 --> 21:30.613
Is there something
I can help you with?

21:30.615 --> 21:32.282
Yeah, I could really
use a computer,

21:32.284 --> 21:34.684
or a proper pen and paper!

21:34.686 --> 21:36.720
God, even a bloody slide-rule!

21:42.092 --> 21:42.959
I'm sorry, Will.

21:55.006 --> 21:56.439
These energy readings
from the boundary?

21:56.441 --> 21:59.676
Over a century's
worth.

21:59.678 --> 22:00.544
Do you know that when
this time dilation field

22:00.546 --> 22:03.313
first came into existence,

22:03.315 --> 22:04.815
it was the size of a city block?

22:04.817 --> 22:08.351
And now it's over
12 kilometers in diameter.

22:08.353 --> 22:10.587
And every few decades,
the pressure builds,

22:10.589 --> 22:11.855
like before an earthquake.

22:11.857 --> 22:15.258
And when it breaks apart,
the dome grows.

22:15.260 --> 22:16.393
We know this.

22:16.395 --> 22:17.661
But what we didn't know

22:17.663 --> 22:19.096
was that it was happening
exponentially.

22:20.398 --> 22:22.265
The energy readings
from the past 20 years

22:22.267 --> 22:23.233
are climbing steadily,

22:23.235 --> 22:24.367
beyond anything

22:24.369 --> 22:26.336
we've ever measured.

22:26.338 --> 22:28.538
So the dome's getting ready
for another growth spurt.

22:28.540 --> 22:30.040
A massive one.

22:30.042 --> 22:32.276
Define "massive."

22:32.278 --> 22:33.711
Half the eastern coast
of France,

22:33.713 --> 22:37.214
and if it keeps
growing at this rate,

22:37.216 --> 22:39.383
in 120 years,

22:39.385 --> 22:42.520
the time dilation field
will blanket the entire Earth.

22:42.522 --> 22:46.123
120 years for us...

22:46.125 --> 22:47.692
In here, but out there--

22:47.694 --> 22:49.394
three weeks

22:49.396 --> 22:52.097
before the planet
is torn apart.

22:59.823 --> 23:01.481
This is ridiculous.

23:01.563 --> 23:02.498
Agreed.

23:02.499 --> 23:04.398
I mean, I didn't even work
on that time dilation node

23:04.400 --> 23:06.066
we salvaged
from Worth's warehouse.

23:06.068 --> 23:07.101
Right.

23:07.103 --> 23:08.001
Neither did you,
by the way.

23:08.003 --> 23:09.703
Right again.

23:09.705 --> 23:11.405
And yet here we are
trying to recreate it

23:11.407 --> 23:14.275
using pieces
of old laptops,

23:14.277 --> 23:17.011
and-and-and iPods,
and...

23:17.013 --> 23:18.580
What is that?

23:18.582 --> 23:20.549
Thermostat
from a toaster.

23:20.551 --> 23:22.318
I'm sorry I asked.

23:24.288 --> 23:25.855
Look...

23:25.857 --> 23:28.625
We know the epicenter
of the original eruption.

23:28.627 --> 23:31.428
Now, all subsequent growth
radiated from there.

23:31.430 --> 23:34.030
If I can nullify
the time dilation field

23:34.032 --> 23:35.065
at that spot--

23:35.067 --> 23:36.199
it would burst this bubble

23:36.201 --> 23:37.634
and return Carentan
to normal time?

23:37.636 --> 23:39.201
Come on,

23:39.203 --> 23:40.469
it can't be that simple.

23:40.471 --> 23:41.704
Well, unfortunately,
you're right.

23:41.706 --> 23:44.073
However, we are lucky

23:44.075 --> 23:46.408
in that we have
decades of research

23:46.410 --> 23:47.443
at our disposal.

23:48.511 --> 23:50.979
I sense a "but" coming.

23:50.981 --> 23:54.482
We are missing
a key element,

23:54.484 --> 23:57.252
an element found
in Worth's time node.

23:57.254 --> 23:58.319
Cerrelium.

23:58.321 --> 24:01.422
Okay, so where do we find that?

24:01.424 --> 24:03.024
Hollow Earth.

24:03.026 --> 24:05.059
Perfect.

24:05.061 --> 24:06.628
Or...

24:06.630 --> 24:08.663
From the time node
that Henry dismantled.

24:08.665 --> 24:10.065
At the Sanctuary?

24:10.067 --> 24:11.066
Mm.

24:11.068 --> 24:12.367
In case you've forgotten,

24:12.369 --> 24:14.270
we can't just reach out
and touch someone.

24:14.272 --> 24:16.139
You know, I've been
thinking about that,

24:16.141 --> 24:20.010
and I may have a way.

24:24.516 --> 24:25.783
You were right.

24:25.785 --> 24:28.520
This is the ultimate
slow-broadcast message.

24:28.522 --> 24:30.288
It's no wonder the satellites
couldn't pick up

24:30.290 --> 24:31.555
any movement in Carentan.

24:31.557 --> 24:32.590
In real-world time,

24:32.592 --> 24:33.591
we're moving
so fast,

24:33.593 --> 24:34.759
we're not even a blur.

24:34.761 --> 24:36.360
We are invisible.

24:36.362 --> 24:37.795
But this should get
somebody's attention.

24:45.569 --> 24:47.270
Look at him.

24:47.272 --> 24:49.605
I remember
the early days.

24:49.607 --> 24:51.207
It wasn't easy.

24:51.209 --> 24:55.312
Go, talk to him.

25:11.131 --> 25:12.465
Evening.

25:12.467 --> 25:14.800
May I sit down?

25:14.802 --> 25:17.770
Sure, please.

25:22.409 --> 25:23.409
So, how are you?

25:25.879 --> 25:26.745
I'm okay.

25:26.747 --> 25:28.648
You?

25:28.650 --> 25:30.482
Every day
a new bone creaks.

25:32.486 --> 25:34.553
But it does get easier,
you know.

25:38.258 --> 25:40.426
I'm not sure I want it to.

25:45.365 --> 25:46.799
When did you...

25:46.801 --> 25:48.201
Give up?

25:48.203 --> 25:50.203
I was going to say "surrender."

25:52.307 --> 25:54.507
I can't recall
a specific moment.

25:54.509 --> 25:56.709
I guess it happened
gradually,

25:56.711 --> 25:59.378
a day at a time.

25:59.380 --> 26:01.280
Next thing I knew,

26:01.282 --> 26:03.382
one day had
turned into decades.

26:05.418 --> 26:08.186
And you don't miss
the real world?

26:08.188 --> 26:09.488
Of course I do,

26:09.490 --> 26:11.523
but I've got a family here now,

26:11.525 --> 26:12.758
a life.

26:16.863 --> 26:18.797
<i>So it wasn't</i>
<i>just interference?</i>

26:18.799 --> 26:21.133
It was an extremely
compressed radio signal.

26:21.135 --> 26:22.000
From here?

26:22.002 --> 26:23.234
<i>From Carentan.</i>

26:23.236 --> 26:24.502
It's Magnus!

26:27.239 --> 26:30.140
Number 37...

26:30.142 --> 26:33.243
750 gauss.

26:33.245 --> 26:34.711
Probably
too much copper.

26:34.713 --> 26:36.646
Yeah.

26:36.648 --> 26:40.482
You know, I-I think
I need another coil here.

26:40.484 --> 26:42.885
Did I see one
in the tool box?

26:50.659 --> 26:52.694
Happy Birthday.

26:52.696 --> 26:55.798
I can't believe
you remembered.

26:55.800 --> 26:57.400
Neither can I.

26:57.402 --> 26:58.634
Can I open it?

26:58.636 --> 27:00.003
Yeah,

27:00.005 --> 27:01.705
but I-I don't want you
to get too excited, okay?

27:01.707 --> 27:04.208
It's nothing much.

27:06.177 --> 27:08.312
It's beautiful.

27:08.314 --> 27:09.647
See, I think
I screwed up the clasp--

27:09.649 --> 27:10.848
Oh, be quiet.

27:17.255 --> 27:18.321
See, I knew it.

27:22.392 --> 27:24.326
I love it.

27:37.374 --> 27:38.541
I'm glad you like it.

27:40.445 --> 27:41.945
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have--

27:41.947 --> 27:45.249
No, no, no, no...

27:46.752 --> 27:49.421
It's just complicated.

27:49.423 --> 27:51.357
Abby.

27:53.427 --> 27:54.561
Complicated.

27:55.796 --> 27:57.563
Not for me.

28:00.368 --> 28:02.602
But, see, you're...

28:04.338 --> 28:06.573
And she's the past, and...

28:08.476 --> 28:10.776
Dark time is coming.

28:10.778 --> 28:12.545
If we make it through
the famine years

28:12.547 --> 28:15.614
till sunrise...

28:15.616 --> 28:18.584
I want to have a baby.

28:24.724 --> 28:26.592
Hey, Magnus.

28:26.594 --> 28:27.693
How's everything?

28:27.695 --> 28:28.761
Great.

28:28.763 --> 28:30.529
Yeah.

28:30.531 --> 28:33.498
I'll go
get us some lunch.

28:37.504 --> 28:39.639
Anything you want to tell me?

28:42.943 --> 28:44.910
No.

28:44.912 --> 28:47.847
About the magnetic readings?

28:49.883 --> 28:51.383
Oh, that.

28:51.385 --> 28:52.418
Uh, yeah.

28:53.854 --> 28:56.388
None of the metals
that we smelted together

28:56.390 --> 28:58.924
have nearly enough
gauss as cerrelium.

28:58.926 --> 29:00.760
Damn.

29:00.762 --> 29:02.394
Means we'll
have to wait

29:02.396 --> 29:04.463
and hope that someone's
seen the rock signal.

29:06.699 --> 29:08.334
And what if they do?

29:10.970 --> 29:13.405
I mean, that could take years
in our time

29:13.407 --> 29:14.540
to get that node here,

29:14.542 --> 29:15.941
and even then,

29:15.943 --> 29:17.709
there's no guarantee
that it's going to work.

29:17.711 --> 29:20.011
No, there isn't.

29:20.013 --> 29:20.679
Yeah.

29:20.681 --> 29:21.746
Will--

29:21.748 --> 29:24.549
No, look...

29:24.551 --> 29:26.884
You're immortal,
essentially,

29:26.886 --> 29:29.486
but I'm not.

29:29.488 --> 29:30.887
I mean, has it ever
occurred to you

29:30.889 --> 29:34.391
that we may not solve
this problem in my lifetime?

29:47.408 --> 29:49.409
Time dilation field?

29:49.411 --> 29:50.810
Her message is
irrefutable evidence

29:50.812 --> 29:51.912
they're still alive!

29:51.914 --> 29:54.080
And they need help,
so let's move!

29:54.082 --> 29:55.448
Your colleagues
took it upon themselves

29:55.450 --> 29:56.549
to break through
the barrier.

29:56.551 --> 29:58.117
Their fate is
their own responsibility.

29:58.119 --> 29:59.985
So, what the hell are you
and your boys doing here, then?

29:59.987 --> 30:01.086
'Cause you're
certainly not helping

30:01.088 --> 30:02.655
anyone trapped
in Carentan.

30:02.657 --> 30:05.023
There is a plan.
It's in motion.

30:05.025 --> 30:05.890
Oh, yeah, right.

30:05.892 --> 30:07.025
Hey, this satellite feed...

30:07.027 --> 30:08.593
How long has this been here?

30:08.595 --> 30:09.427
A few minutes ago.

30:09.429 --> 30:11.362
It suddenly appeared.

30:11.364 --> 30:13.064
That's an elemental symbol.

30:13.066 --> 30:14.065
Not according to
my science guys.

30:14.067 --> 30:15.633
No element on earth
like that.

30:15.635 --> 30:16.700
True.

30:16.702 --> 30:18.669
It's the symbol
for cerrelium.

30:18.671 --> 30:19.604
An element found...

30:19.606 --> 30:22.573
Elsewhere.

30:22.575 --> 30:23.907
<i>All personnel.</i>

30:23.909 --> 30:24.975
<i>Project Greenhouse is a go.</i>

30:24.977 --> 30:27.511
<i>T-minus 37 minutes. Mark.</i>

30:27.513 --> 30:29.580
This is a message
from Magnus and Will.

30:29.582 --> 30:30.614
What does it mean?

30:30.616 --> 30:33.084
Uh, it's hard to explain,

30:33.086 --> 30:34.452
but give us time.

30:34.454 --> 30:35.387
Time, you don't have.

30:35.389 --> 30:37.556
The field is expanding.

30:37.558 --> 30:38.724
My job is to stop it.

30:40.393 --> 30:42.895
Project Greenhouse.

30:42.897 --> 30:43.897
It's an air strike.

30:45.600 --> 30:47.434
They're going to blow
Carentan off the map.

30:48.286 --> 30:49.985
there's no way we're
going to beat the air strike.

30:50.040 --> 30:51.645
Does it have to be cerrelium?

30:51.646 --> 30:54.080
<i>There must be something</i>
<i>else we can substitute.</i>

30:54.082 --> 30:55.080
I don't know...

30:56.649 --> 30:58.617
Okay, Biggie,
remember last week

30:58.619 --> 30:59.985
when you were making
that bouillabaisse,

30:59.987 --> 31:01.086
and you ran out of saffron,

31:01.088 --> 31:04.023
<i>so you used turmeric instead,</i>

31:04.025 --> 31:04.990
and it tasted just as good.

31:04.992 --> 31:06.125
Did not.

31:06.127 --> 31:07.860
You get my point.

31:07.862 --> 31:10.463
All right,
let's give it a shot.

31:10.465 --> 31:11.998
What do you got
in your kitchen over there?

31:20.975 --> 31:22.676
Should be
just up ahead.

31:22.678 --> 31:24.211
By the way, Will,

31:24.213 --> 31:26.514
Happy New Year.

31:26.516 --> 31:29.149
Somehow I don't
feel like celebrating.

31:29.151 --> 31:30.684
You see that sky?

31:30.686 --> 31:33.587
Sunset's beginning.

31:33.589 --> 31:34.887
45 days until nightfall.

31:34.889 --> 31:36.789
The solar panels
will go dead,

31:36.791 --> 31:39.058
we'll lose power
to the lab.

31:39.060 --> 31:41.594
Which is why we're
testing this node now.

31:41.596 --> 31:43.663
Here we are,

31:43.665 --> 31:45.866
the epicenter of
the original disturbance.

31:56.212 --> 31:57.813
You know,
without the cerrelium...

31:57.815 --> 31:59.214
I agree,

31:59.216 --> 32:01.616
and if time weren't
forcing my hand, I'd wait,

32:01.618 --> 32:05.253
but what choice do we have?

32:05.255 --> 32:07.956
Say a prayer.

32:27.009 --> 32:29.278
Turn it off!

32:32.582 --> 32:33.916
Bloody hell!

32:49.099 --> 32:50.666
Ravi?

32:51.702 --> 32:53.202
Ravi!

32:55.923 --> 32:57.548
Your experiment,
my God.

32:57.549 --> 32:58.548
What happened?

32:58.550 --> 32:59.683
People disappeared.

32:59.685 --> 33:02.052
What do you mean?

33:02.054 --> 33:03.220
Everything went very fast,

33:03.222 --> 33:07.325
then slow,
and then they were gone.

33:07.327 --> 33:08.993
Just vanished?

33:08.995 --> 33:11.128
I saw one of them
with my own eyes.

33:11.130 --> 33:12.563
Andre.

33:12.565 --> 33:14.265
He was re-sheeting
one of the solar panels.

33:14.267 --> 33:15.700
He fell,

33:15.702 --> 33:18.836
but vanished before
he hit the ground.

33:18.838 --> 33:19.904
Magnus, what have we done?

33:19.906 --> 33:22.074
Four people
were vaporized

33:22.076 --> 33:23.875
because our experiment failed.

33:25.111 --> 33:26.645
What if it didn't fail?

33:26.647 --> 33:28.046
What if,

33:28.048 --> 33:29.447
for a few seconds,

33:29.449 --> 33:31.349
we managed to diffuse
the time dilation field?

33:31.351 --> 33:33.318
Well, then why did
those people disappear?

33:33.320 --> 33:38.156
Because when Carentan resets
itself to real world time,

33:38.158 --> 33:40.826
they don't exist.

33:40.828 --> 33:43.261
In your time,
they haven't been born yet.

33:44.830 --> 33:47.232
Okay, okay, so...

33:47.234 --> 33:48.934
If we get the cerrelium,
stabilize the node,

33:48.936 --> 33:49.834
make it work properly...

33:49.836 --> 33:51.936
Then anything
inside this dome

33:51.938 --> 33:54.005
that was created
after its inception,

33:54.007 --> 33:56.708
equipment, animals, people,

33:56.710 --> 33:58.977
will cease to exist.

33:58.979 --> 34:01.079
And the only people
who'll survive

34:01.081 --> 34:03.381
the reset...

34:03.383 --> 34:05.784
The three of us.

34:05.786 --> 34:07.052
Everybody else...

34:07.054 --> 34:07.886
No!

34:07.888 --> 34:09.888
No...

34:09.889 --> 34:10.822
Josie...

34:10.824 --> 34:12.358
Josie, wait!

34:12.360 --> 34:13.958
Josie, wait!

34:27.806 --> 34:29.308
Hey, stop!

34:29.310 --> 34:30.141
Look at me!

34:30.143 --> 34:33.212
We didn't know!

34:33.214 --> 34:34.146
We didn't know.

34:35.648 --> 34:37.282
We didn't know.

34:37.284 --> 34:38.650
But now you do.

34:39.710 --> 34:43.079
So are you going to
continue your experiments,

34:43.081 --> 34:44.981
even though we would all just...

34:49.788 --> 34:52.991
How could you just...

34:52.993 --> 34:55.726
Disappear me?

35:08.740 --> 35:10.107
Oh, beauty.

35:10.109 --> 35:11.408
It's not going to be easy

35:11.410 --> 35:12.820
walking a surface-to-air missile
past these guys.

35:12.821 --> 35:14.187
We don't need
the whole missile.

35:14.189 --> 35:16.255
The alloy Biggie mentioned
is the thruster stage.

35:16.257 --> 35:18.224
It's part of the heat shield.

35:18.226 --> 35:20.393
Uh, I don't suppose
you have a screwdriver?

35:22.897 --> 35:23.931
Penknife?

35:23.933 --> 35:25.799
Yeah.

35:28.403 --> 35:30.505
Here.

35:32.742 --> 35:36.078
Oh, come to mama...

35:36.080 --> 35:36.913
Okay.

35:43.152 --> 35:45.253
You're going
to need this.

35:45.255 --> 35:47.221
Thanks.

35:56.497 --> 35:58.365
Hold your fire!

36:06.174 --> 36:09.977
What the hell
was that all about?

36:09.979 --> 36:11.045
It's not cerrelium,

36:11.047 --> 36:12.046
but I was able to use

36:12.048 --> 36:13.982
parts of
the missile they sent.

36:13.984 --> 36:16.384
How's it going?

36:16.386 --> 36:18.854
As usual,
slower than I'd like.

36:18.856 --> 36:22.824
Hopefully this new shielding
will do the trick.

36:30.265 --> 36:31.532
One more stunt like that,

36:31.534 --> 36:32.366
and the next bullet
goes in your head.

36:32.368 --> 36:33.334
To hell with you!

36:33.336 --> 36:35.202
There are people
alive in there!

36:35.204 --> 36:36.070
There's still a chance
to save them!

36:36.072 --> 36:37.505
Not in the next nine minutes.

36:37.507 --> 36:39.273
The birds are already
in the air.

36:39.275 --> 36:41.108
Let's go.

36:56.626 --> 36:58.527
I don't hate you.

37:01.532 --> 37:04.534
If the dome
continues to spread,

37:04.536 --> 37:10.273
continents shifting
at lightning speed...

37:10.275 --> 37:17.514
Oceans born
in the blink of an eye...

37:18.636 --> 37:24.640
The stress on the Earth's core
will rip this planet apart.

37:26.642 --> 37:30.378
I understand
all that.

37:30.380 --> 37:33.380
Like you,
I'm a scientist,

37:33.382 --> 37:36.984
but I'm also a husband.

37:41.189 --> 37:46.427
The sun has
almost set.

37:55.371 --> 37:57.639
Are you ready?

38:13.439 --> 38:14.839
Can I really
be doing this?

38:14.841 --> 38:16.274
Please, dear,

38:16.276 --> 38:18.477
I can't talk
about this anymore.

38:18.479 --> 38:24.451
If our small sacrifice
can save billions of people...

38:26.320 --> 38:29.389
You were always
the stronger one.

38:29.391 --> 38:31.124
Whenever the children got sick,

38:31.126 --> 38:32.792
I would worry so much,

38:32.794 --> 38:34.260
but you--

38:34.262 --> 38:37.897
we will never leave you,
I promise.

38:37.899 --> 38:40.166
If you don't see us here,

38:40.168 --> 38:41.701
look here.

38:41.703 --> 38:44.871
That's where
we will be.

38:44.873 --> 38:46.840
Always.

38:52.245 --> 38:54.212
Now, go, my love.

38:54.214 --> 38:58.416
It's time for you
to be the strong one.

39:06.924 --> 39:09.559
The shielding is as
secure as it'll ever be.

39:09.561 --> 39:11.695
It's been a long time,

39:11.697 --> 39:15.232
not a good time.

39:15.234 --> 39:18.902
I just wish I knew
how to say goodbye.

39:25.811 --> 39:27.612
It's Ravi!

39:33.518 --> 39:35.586
There's a crowd
in the street.

39:35.588 --> 39:37.621
I told them that you'd
come out and speak with them.

39:37.623 --> 39:39.857
They're watching the front
of the mayor's office.

39:39.859 --> 39:41.425
All right, we'll
go through the basement

39:41.427 --> 39:42.459
and out the back.

39:42.461 --> 39:43.561
I don't know how long
I can hold them.

39:43.563 --> 39:45.329
Every second
counts.

39:45.331 --> 39:47.798
Thank you.

39:51.335 --> 39:52.403
Just listen to us!

39:52.405 --> 39:53.670
The time dilation field's

39:53.672 --> 39:55.772
a massive
concentration of energy.

39:55.774 --> 39:57.140
You hit that sucker
with a bomb,

39:57.142 --> 39:59.543
and there is no telling
what the fallout will be!

39:59.545 --> 40:01.278
You still don't get it,
do you?

40:01.280 --> 40:04.515
The train has left the station.

40:04.517 --> 40:05.749
Whatever happens,

40:05.751 --> 40:06.650
it's all going to be over
in 60 seconds.

40:11.435 --> 40:12.435
Magnus!

40:12.437 --> 40:13.736
Will!

40:13.738 --> 40:15.238
What is it?

40:15.240 --> 40:16.773
You've got to hurry.
I couldn't hold them.

40:16.775 --> 40:19.409
They have found out
where you are.

40:19.411 --> 40:20.710
Stop!

40:24.448 --> 40:26.616
Stop!

40:26.618 --> 40:29.319
Josie...

40:31.322 --> 40:32.656
Josie, don't do this.

40:34.192 --> 40:37.261
Helen, get away
from that machine.

40:41.267 --> 40:42.934
Please.

40:44.504 --> 40:47.206
Who the hell are you to say
who lives and who dies?

40:55.517 --> 40:57.150
Josie!

40:57.152 --> 40:58.417
No!

41:28.211 --> 41:29.345
We made it.

41:35.218 --> 41:36.285
Ravi didn't.

41:46.863 --> 41:50.366
Anyone else?

41:57.943 --> 41:59.276
After the reset,

41:59.278 --> 42:02.647
we were found
in the field.

42:02.649 --> 42:04.683
Kate said something
about a...

42:04.685 --> 42:06.618
An air strike
that was called off

42:06.620 --> 42:08.354
at the last second,

42:08.356 --> 42:11.256
but I was still
pretty groggy.

42:11.258 --> 42:12.858
I could have
dreamt that.

42:16.629 --> 42:18.062
They had a million
questions,

42:18.064 --> 42:21.932
but I told them
to let you sleep.

42:21.934 --> 42:23.566
Thank you...

42:25.569 --> 42:29.639
But now we need to get to work.

42:29.641 --> 42:31.341
Something,

42:31.343 --> 42:32.609
or someone,

42:32.611 --> 42:35.512
is behind what happened
in Carentan.

42:35.514 --> 42:36.813
I feel it in my gut.

42:38.983 --> 42:40.984
You're not blaming
yourself, are you?

42:42.920 --> 42:44.788
Until I know differently.
