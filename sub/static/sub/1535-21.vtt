00:02.499 --> 00:04.366
Hey, would you like
to hear some songs

00:04.368 --> 00:07.836
I've rewritten to get children
interested in the hard sciences?

00:07.838 --> 00:09.038
Sure.
Really?

00:09.040 --> 00:11.040
Yeah. Well, I like
music, I like science,

00:11.042 --> 00:14.143
I like making fun

Thank you.

Do either of you know Beyoncé?

00:54.118 --> 00:56.051
I'd love her to get behind it.

00:56.053 --> 00:57.920
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Hey.

00:57.922 --> 00:59.354
Hey. - Hey.
Hello.

00:59.356 --> 01:01.323
You guys know the new
Discovery class missions

01:01.325 --> 01:02.691
that NASA's been working on?
Yeah.

01:02.693 --> 01:04.927
Well, they're looking
to include a message from Earth

01:04.929 --> 01:07.705
in case one of them
is encountered by alien life.

01:07.728 --> 01:08.363
LEONARD: Oh.

01:08.365 --> 01:10.365
When I encountered alien life,
I-I discovered

01:10.367 --> 01:13.902
that the key thing
was not to sit in its spot.

01:13.904 --> 01:17.673
All right, you can't breathe
our air without an inhaler,

01:17.675 --> 01:19.475
he's allergic
to Earth nuts,

01:19.477 --> 01:20.642
but I'm the alien.

01:20.644 --> 01:22.644
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Anyway,

01:22.646 --> 01:24.446
I'm among a handful
of scientists

01:24.448 --> 01:26.782
that have been asked to submit
a design proposal

01:26.784 --> 01:28.884
for the message
and its delivery system.

01:28.886 --> 01:30.919
Excellent. - Congratulations.
Good for you.

01:30.921 --> 01:32.988
And I was wondering
if any of you guys

01:32.990 --> 01:34.890
would like
to help me do it.

01:34.892 --> 01:37.126
Are you kidding? Yes.
What did you have in mind?

01:37.128 --> 01:39.895
I'll tell you exactly what you
should do: avoid the presumption

01:39.897 --> 01:42.931
of the Terran sensory input paradigm.
WOLOWITZ: Yeah, absolutely.

01:42.933 --> 01:44.800
You need a device capable
of delivering information

01:44.802 --> 01:47.569
across a wide range
of perceptual modalities.

01:47.571 --> 01:50.172
Any intelligent organism
would at the very least need

01:50.174 --> 01:52.508
the ability to locate the
position of objects in space.

01:52.510 --> 01:56.345
So the ideal interstellar
lingua franca would be haptic.

01:56.347 --> 01:58.447
Ooh, how about a 3-D
tactile communicator rigged

01:58.449 --> 02:00.115
for cross-sensory transposition?

02:00.117 --> 02:01.216
Exactly what I expected.

02:01.218 --> 02:02.918
Two people
forcing their ideas on me

02:02.920 --> 02:04.820
and only one gentleman
who could be bothered

02:04.822 --> 02:06.288
to ask me what my thoughts were.

02:06.290 --> 02:08.323
You two are out.
Congratulations, Leonard,

02:08.324 --> 02:10.092
you're on the team.

02:43.114 --> 02:44.815
Hey. Thanks
for coming by.

02:44.817 --> 02:46.517
Yeah. I'm excited to help.

02:46.519 --> 02:48.252
I would have included
the others, but...

02:48.254 --> 02:49.820
you know exactly
what would've happened.

02:49.822 --> 02:52.256
They would've taken over the
project and bossed us around.

02:52.258 --> 02:53.724
I get it.

02:53.726 --> 02:56.260
Uh, just this morning, Sheldon
wouldn't let me put almond milk

02:56.262 --> 02:57.495
on my Grape-Nuts because he said

02:57.497 --> 03:00.565
it was
a theoretical nut conflict.

03:00.567 --> 03:02.934
You should have told him
to mind his own business.

03:02.936 --> 03:05.436
Yeah. That's better
than what I did say, which was,

03:05.438 --> 03:08.206
“Fine, I'll eat them
with club soda.”

03:08.208 --> 03:11.809
What makes them think they're
always in charge of everything?

03:11.811 --> 03:12.977
Mmm, they're alpha males.

03:12.979 --> 03:14.579
(chuckles)
What does that make us?

03:14.581 --> 03:16.714
We could be betas.
They're second in charge.

03:16.716 --> 03:17.682
Okay, that sounds good.

03:17.684 --> 03:18.916
Or we could be omegas.

03:18.918 --> 03:21.686
They get pushed around
by the alphas and the betas.

03:21.688 --> 03:24.021
Okay, that sounds like us.

03:24.023 --> 03:26.290
Whatever. There's
no alphas here,

03:26.292 --> 03:28.092
and this is
your project.

03:28.094 --> 03:30.161
You're in charge.
How do you want to start?

03:30.163 --> 03:33.197
I don't know.
How do you want to start?

03:34.033 --> 03:36.467
I don't know.

03:37.770 --> 03:39.804
(sighs)

03:39.806 --> 03:42.306
Should we call Sheldon
and Howard?

03:42.308 --> 03:43.975
No. We can do this by ourselves.

03:43.977 --> 03:45.710
Okay. Great.
How do you want to start?

03:45.712 --> 03:47.311
I don't know.
How do you want to start?

03:52.952 --> 03:54.986
Sheldon. Sheldon.

03:54.988 --> 03:57.154
Sheldon.

04:03.463 --> 04:06.364
I bet that started off
as a joke,

04:06.366 --> 04:09.000
but by the third one
you realized

04:09.002 --> 04:12.703
there was something
strangely enjoyable about it.

04:12.705 --> 04:16.207
Yeah, I kind of want
to do it again.

04:16.209 --> 04:18.909
I don't recommend it. You'll be
doing it the rest of your life.

04:20.647 --> 04:23.514
Anyway, if you're looking for
Leonard, he's with Koothrappali.

04:23.516 --> 04:25.149
Uh, no, I actually came
to talk to you.

04:25.151 --> 04:27.585
How nice.

04:28.955 --> 04:30.588
Here are some topics
that interest me:

04:30.590 --> 04:33.858
quantum mechanics, trains, flags...
No, no.

04:33.860 --> 04:36.227
It's about my acting career.
Oh, sorry.

04:36.229 --> 04:37.528
That's not on the list.

04:37.530 --> 04:39.196
Well...
Oh, wait. No.

04:39.198 --> 04:40.364
How about
we split

04:40.366 --> 04:43.367
the difference
and discuss why Austria

04:43.369 --> 04:47.038
was an archduchy
and not just a regular duchy.

04:47.040 --> 04:50.041
Okay, look, here's the thing.
I like pharmaceutical sales--

04:50.043 --> 04:52.343
it's going great-- but I have
an audition for a movie,

04:52.345 --> 04:54.378
and if I get it,
it could screw everything up.

04:54.380 --> 04:57.648
Hmm. I know
exactly what you should do.

04:57.650 --> 05:00.084
Unfortunately,
I cannot tell you.

05:00.920 --> 05:03.587
Well, why?
(sighs)

05:03.589 --> 05:05.589
I'm attempting
to turn over a new leaf.

05:05.591 --> 05:07.358
Earlier today,
it was pointed out to me

05:07.360 --> 05:09.960
that I tend to force my ideas
on people.

05:11.364 --> 05:13.331
You're really
not gonna tell me?

05:13.333 --> 05:16.567
No, that train has left
the station.

05:16.569 --> 05:17.835
Now, we can
play this

05:17.837 --> 05:19.036
one of two ways.

05:19.038 --> 05:21.806
You can say,
“Trains, tell me more,”

05:21.808 --> 05:22.907
or...

05:22.909 --> 05:25.042
you can just look at me
like that

05:25.044 --> 05:26.911
and I'll start.

05:30.983 --> 05:32.683
What's going on
in here?

05:32.685 --> 05:35.619
I am making molecular cocktails.

05:35.621 --> 05:39.390
This sphere is actually
a cosmopolitan.

05:39.392 --> 05:40.524
(chuckles)
Oh.

05:40.526 --> 05:41.726
How do you drink it?

05:41.728 --> 05:44.829
Oh, just put it in your
mouth and pop it like a zit.

05:46.199 --> 05:48.499
I think I'll have a beer.

05:48.501 --> 05:49.967
First take a
picture with me.

05:49.969 --> 05:50.752
Why?

05:50.776 --> 05:53.036
Well, Raj and I always
talked about learning

05:53.039 --> 05:57.441
how to make cocktails like this
together, so I taught myself

05:57.443 --> 06:00.244
and I'm putting this on
Instagram so he can see it

06:00.246 --> 06:03.748
and feel like a turd.
Say cheese.

06:03.750 --> 06:06.517
Is this about the space probe
he's working on without you?

06:06.519 --> 06:08.085
You betcha. The very one.

06:09.956 --> 06:11.489
Howard, you're grown men.

06:11.491 --> 06:13.591
You guys don't have
to do everything together.

06:13.593 --> 06:17.561
I know. That's why I'm
spending tonight with you.

06:17.563 --> 06:19.697
Trying to hurt Raj's feelings.

06:19.699 --> 06:21.799
With my honeybunch.

06:22.668 --> 06:24.535
You're being childish.

06:24.537 --> 06:26.404
No. He is.

06:26.406 --> 06:28.706
So I have a dominant
personality.

06:28.708 --> 06:30.641
We all know that.

06:31.477 --> 06:34.044
I'm sorry. What do we know?

06:34.046 --> 06:36.013
In social groupings,

06:36.015 --> 06:40.217
I just naturally wind up
in charge.

06:40.219 --> 06:42.153
Don't take this the wrong way,
but how many

06:42.155 --> 06:44.622
of these little booze balls
have you had?

06:45.458 --> 06:47.258
You don't think I'm a leader?

06:47.260 --> 06:49.727
I was kidding.
Of course you are.

06:49.729 --> 06:51.929
Right. I couldn't change
if I wanted to.

06:51.931 --> 06:55.065
You better not change,
because I love who you are.

06:55.067 --> 06:57.668
Now, will you need help cleaning
all this up when you're done

06:57.670 --> 06:59.637
or can you do it
all by yourself?

06:59.639 --> 07:01.172
All by myself.

07:01.174 --> 07:03.474
There's my big boss man.

07:06.746 --> 07:10.381
So, often on the front
of the locomotive

07:10.383 --> 07:13.384
is a large iron wedge

07:13.386 --> 07:15.786
for clearing objects
off the tracks.

07:15.788 --> 07:18.556
Now, while commonly
known as a cowcatcher,

07:18.558 --> 07:22.560
I prefer the more
accurate “cow exploder”"

07:23.796 --> 07:26.530
Okay. Sheldon,
let me ask you a question.

07:26.532 --> 07:28.732
Mmm.
If I was at a train station

07:28.734 --> 07:31.335
and one train could take me
to my current job

07:31.337 --> 07:34.371
and the other train could take
me to an audition for a movie,

07:34.373 --> 07:36.740
which train should I get on?

07:39.212 --> 07:44.081
Are you using trains to trick me
into giving you advice?

07:44.083 --> 07:46.750
No.

07:46.752 --> 07:49.386
All right, then.

07:49.388 --> 07:51.655
You should take a third train

07:51.657 --> 07:53.991
where you audition
for the movie

07:53.993 --> 07:56.026
but hold off
on making a career decision

07:56.028 --> 07:57.862
until you have more information.

07:57.864 --> 07:59.530
Oh. You're right.

07:59.532 --> 08:01.932
I'm worried about something
that hasn't even happened yet.

08:01.934 --> 08:03.300
Huh.

08:03.302 --> 08:06.036
You are a wise man.

08:06.038 --> 08:08.205
Well, Penny, who's smarter:
the wise man

08:08.207 --> 08:12.576
or the person who comes to him
for advice?

08:13.412 --> 08:15.346
Oh, I guess you're right.

08:15.348 --> 08:17.581
Maybe it is the person who asks.

08:17.583 --> 08:20.050
No, it's the wise man.

08:23.256 --> 08:26.757
That's why he's called
the wise man.

08:26.759 --> 08:29.126
You know how I know that?

08:29.128 --> 08:31.595
I'm the wise man.

08:32.631 --> 08:34.932
I'm sorry. What was I thinking?

08:34.933 --> 08:36.500
Uh, just out
of curiosity,

08:36.501 --> 08:38.567
why didn't you ask Leonard
for advice about this?

08:38.568 --> 08:38.995
(groans)

08:39.038 --> 08:40.471
'Cause I already know
what he'll say.

08:40.472 --> 08:43.506
(whining voice): “Wah, wah, wah,
you shouldn't do it.”

08:43.509 --> 08:45.943
It's just like he's here!

08:48.447 --> 08:50.414
Okay, so we know
that previous attempts

08:50.416 --> 08:52.583
to send a message into space,
like the Golden Record

08:52.585 --> 08:54.785
on <i> Voyager,</i>
were heavily criticized.

08:54.787 --> 08:56.387
Well, aliens could only play
the Golden Record

08:56.389 --> 08:58.389
if they figured out
how to build a record player.

08:58.391 --> 09:01.725
Eh. Although, to be fair,
I watched E.T. build a telephone

09:01.727 --> 09:04.094
out of a Speak & Spell
and an umbrella.

09:05.131 --> 09:08.098
Dude was like
a little brown MacGyver.

09:08.100 --> 09:10.301
That would be more helpful
if E.T. were real.

09:10.303 --> 09:15.406
Well, my feelings were real
when he was about to die.

09:15.408 --> 09:19.877
My God, when he's on the table
and they use the paddles on him.

09:19.879 --> 09:21.211
And he's all white.

09:21.213 --> 09:22.980
They zip him up in that bag.

09:22.982 --> 09:25.716
And Gertie can't stop crying.

09:25.718 --> 09:27.451
The flower dies.

09:27.453 --> 09:29.887
Okay, let's talk
about something else.

09:29.889 --> 09:32.256
All right, all right.
So it-it sounds

09:32.258 --> 09:34.725
like we need a way
to communicate that's simple.

09:34.727 --> 09:36.727
And doesn't require
outside machinery

09:36.729 --> 09:38.195
to be built to access it.

09:38.197 --> 09:40.230
It's also a problem
because we don't even know

09:40.232 --> 09:41.999
if the aliens
who find this can see.

09:42.001 --> 09:43.200
I mean, they might
communicate

09:43.202 --> 09:44.902
in a totally
different way than us.

09:44.904 --> 09:46.870
Like when my dog is mad at me,

09:46.872 --> 09:49.773
she tells me
by peeing in my slippers.

09:49.775 --> 09:53.277
That's actually a valid example.

09:53.279 --> 09:55.946
Animals do deliver messages
through scent.

09:55.948 --> 09:57.715
Bees talk to each other
by dancing.

09:57.717 --> 09:58.882
Whales have their songs.

09:58.884 --> 10:01.485
Penny has about 20 different
ways of rolling her eyes

10:01.487 --> 10:03.621
that each mean
something different.

10:03.623 --> 10:06.123
Okay, so, what it
sounds like is,

10:06.125 --> 10:07.458
what we want is a device

10:07.460 --> 10:09.593
that can deliver a message
through not only sight,

10:09.595 --> 10:10.995
but other senses, as well.

10:10.997 --> 10:14.164
The most basic sense that any
space-faring civilization

10:14.166 --> 10:16.233
would have to possess is touch.

10:16.235 --> 10:18.268
Ooh. Ooh, ooh!

10:18.270 --> 10:20.504
We could make
a video-playing device

10:20.506 --> 10:22.606
that simultaneously translates
the information

10:22.608 --> 10:24.341
into a tactile medium.

10:24.343 --> 10:26.977
All we have to do is rig up
a 3-D communication system!

10:26.979 --> 10:28.078
We-we can totally do that!

10:28.080 --> 10:29.747
I know!
This is great!

10:29.749 --> 10:30.914
Yeah, you know what else it is?
What?

10:30.916 --> 10:32.716
Exactly what Sheldon
and Howard said.

10:35.054 --> 10:37.688
Well, thank you
for peeing in my slippers.

KOOTHRAPPALI:
Hey.

11:16.102 --> 11:17.235
Hello.

11:17.237 --> 11:19.403
Look,

11:19.405 --> 11:22.406
I know you guys are upset,
but we've talked about it,

11:22.408 --> 11:23.941
and we think it'd be beneficial

11:23.943 --> 11:26.244
for you to be part
of the project.

11:27.213 --> 11:30.681
Well, well, well,
did you hear that, Sheldon?

11:30.683 --> 11:33.150
I'm sorry. I was trying
to think of what rhymes

11:33.152 --> 11:35.786
with “nose of the aardvark.”

11:35.788 --> 11:37.121
LEONARD:
We want you

11:37.123 --> 11:39.223
back on the project with us.

11:39.225 --> 11:44.295
Well, well, well, did
you hear that, Howard?

11:44.297 --> 11:45.563
Look, we admit it.

11:45.565 --> 11:48.099
The idea that you guys came
up with was really good,

11:48.101 --> 11:50.101
and I'd love
your help.

11:50.103 --> 11:53.104
I suppose it couldn't have been
easy for you to say that.

11:53.106 --> 11:56.207
It wasn't, so...
are you in?

11:57.777 --> 11:59.143
Certainly.
Sure. Great.

11:59.145 --> 12:01.445
Now that we're all
on the same page,

12:01.447 --> 12:03.247
let's get together tonight
and work on it.

12:03.249 --> 12:04.448
“Get together tonight”?

12:04.450 --> 12:05.916
Leonard, stop trying
to control everything,

12:05.918 --> 12:08.619
and give poor Raj a chance to
come up with what we should do.

12:08.621 --> 12:09.720
Go ahead, Raj.

12:09.722 --> 12:11.622
Okay, I think
we should do it right now.

12:11.624 --> 12:13.024
Tonight works better for me.

12:13.026 --> 12:15.459
Okay.

12:19.732 --> 12:21.098
(sighs)

12:21.100 --> 12:23.601
<i>Okay, it's just an audition.</i>

12:23.603 --> 12:25.269
<i>Why am I nervous?</i>

12:25.271 --> 12:26.637
<i>Maybe it's a good thing.</i>

12:26.639 --> 12:28.539
<i>Just means I want it.</i>

12:28.541 --> 12:30.107
<i>And I can have it.</i>

12:30.109 --> 12:31.542
<i>This feels right.</i>

12:31.544 --> 12:33.744
<i>Why did I ever give this up?</i>

12:37.750 --> 12:41.085
I'm starting to remember.

12:43.222 --> 12:45.890
So, I'd like
to try a technique

12:45.892 --> 12:47.558
where no one gets steamrolled.

12:47.560 --> 12:49.093
When you talk,

12:49.095 --> 12:52.029
instead of bringing up
a new idea, respect what was

12:52.031 --> 12:54.865
just said by building on it.

12:54.867 --> 12:56.600
Uh, building on that...
Mm-hmm.

12:56.602 --> 12:59.203
...we should order dinner.

12:59.205 --> 13:01.505
How is that building
on what he just said?

13:01.507 --> 13:05.009
Building on what Sheldon said,
I could go for Chinese.

13:05.011 --> 13:06.744
Hang on.
Building on what Leonard said,

13:06.746 --> 13:08.145
no one built on what I said.

13:08.147 --> 13:10.081
Building on “building on that”"

13:10.083 --> 13:12.416
there's a new build-your-own
pizza place on Colorado.

13:13.553 --> 13:14.985
Building on that,
I'd like to remind you,

13:14.987 --> 13:16.087
I'm lactose intolerant.

13:16.089 --> 13:17.822
I saw the menu.
They have soy cheese.

13:17.824 --> 13:20.257
Ha, ha! You didn't say
“building on.” You're out!

13:20.259 --> 13:21.959
It's not Simon Says.

13:21.961 --> 13:23.728
Yeah, you're missing the point, Sheldon.
You're out, and you're out.

13:23.730 --> 13:25.229
I win! Who wants pizza?

13:29.135 --> 13:31.102
Penny?

13:31.104 --> 13:32.470
Oh, hey.
Hey.

13:32.472 --> 13:34.372
I haven't seen you
auditioning in a while.

13:34.374 --> 13:37.141
Yeah, uh, I got a job
as a pharmaceutical sales rep.

13:37.143 --> 13:39.243
You quit acting?
Well, kind of.

13:39.245 --> 13:40.711
But now I get to act like

13:40.713 --> 13:44.548
inflamed heart is only
a “mild side effect.” (laughs)

13:44.550 --> 13:46.751
I heard you can make
good money doing that.

13:46.753 --> 13:49.620
Yeah, it's going okay,
but I do miss this sometimes.

13:49.622 --> 13:51.155
Really?
Mmm.

13:51.157 --> 13:53.491
'Cause I got to tell
you, I am so sick

13:53.493 --> 13:56.527
of the humiliation and being
treated like a piece of meat.

13:56.529 --> 13:59.563
Chelsea?
Wish me luck. (laughs)

14:01.300 --> 14:03.467
They're gonna
love you.

14:04.537 --> 14:07.738
I heard she's pushing 40
and everything's fake.

14:08.508 --> 14:10.941
Yeah. I started
that rumor.

14:13.112 --> 14:15.813
Okay, since we agree
on the delivery system

14:15.815 --> 14:17.481
for the message,
maybe we should talk

14:17.483 --> 14:18.749
about what the message could be.

14:18.751 --> 14:21.519
Well, I think we should show
what earthlings look like.

14:21.521 --> 14:24.054
The plaque they sent up on the
<i>Pioneer</i> probe had a drawing

14:24.056 --> 14:25.790
of a naked man
and woman on it.

14:25.792 --> 14:27.191
Yeah, I never cared for that.

14:27.193 --> 14:29.693
It's advertising
to predator races

14:29.695 --> 14:33.597
just how soft
and squishy we are.

14:33.599 --> 14:35.633
Squeeze yourself!

14:35.635 --> 14:36.867
Oh, don't be offended.

14:36.869 --> 14:38.469
You know, of
the four of us,

14:38.471 --> 14:40.471
you have the most
veal-like consistency.

14:42.275 --> 14:44.475
Well, maybe there's a way
to appear nonaggressive,

14:44.477 --> 14:46.977
but also be able to protect
ourselves if necessary.

14:46.979 --> 14:49.513
Like smiling and waving
with one hand,

14:49.515 --> 14:52.883
but the other hand holding
the severed head of a tiger.

14:52.885 --> 14:54.885
You want to send
a passive-aggressive message

14:54.887 --> 14:56.053
out into the universe?

14:56.055 --> 14:57.254
That's ridiculous.

14:57.256 --> 14:58.789
Oh, you mean passive-aggressive

14:58.791 --> 15:00.825
like posting pictures
of you and your wife

15:00.827 --> 15:02.026
eating cosmopolitan balls

15:02.028 --> 15:04.895
that you know belong
in my mouth?

15:06.833 --> 15:08.766
Perhaps Howard meant
passive-aggressive

15:08.768 --> 15:11.402
like asking our group
to help on your project,

15:11.404 --> 15:13.103
and then only
choosing Leonard.

15:13.105 --> 15:15.973
(sighs) Look, I'm sorry
I hurt your feelings,

15:15.975 --> 15:18.476
but you do have
strong personalities

15:18.478 --> 15:20.411
and always end up taking over.

15:20.413 --> 15:21.712
It's not always.

15:21.714 --> 15:23.514
What about when we went
to Comic-Con

15:23.516 --> 15:25.015
and dressed like Jabba the Hutt?

15:25.017 --> 15:27.518
You got to be Jabba's head,
and I got to be

15:27.520 --> 15:29.720
his fat slug butt.

15:31.023 --> 15:33.958
We looked great.

15:33.960 --> 15:36.093
You let a guy sit on me.

15:36.095 --> 15:37.761
He was dressed as Princess Leia.

15:37.763 --> 15:39.830
It made a nice picture.

15:41.667 --> 15:45.102
I'm just saying, sometimes Raj
and I feel pushed aside.

15:45.104 --> 15:47.671
Yeah. Like when you
took Sheldon to Texas

15:47.673 --> 15:49.139
and showed him all around NASA--

15:49.141 --> 15:51.375
you didn't even think
to ask me and Leonard.

15:51.377 --> 15:53.344
You know what?
You're right.

15:53.346 --> 15:55.045
I should have asked you.

15:55.047 --> 15:57.248
Yeah, and if he does
ask you, go.

15:57.250 --> 15:59.216
It's amazing.

16:00.353 --> 16:01.719
Okay, and if
we're talking

16:01.721 --> 16:03.187
about being left
out of things,

16:03.189 --> 16:05.189
you guys went to Skywalker
Ranch without us.

16:05.191 --> 16:06.590
Oh, I recommend that, too.

16:06.592 --> 16:08.959
That was a magical
experience!

16:08.961 --> 16:10.394
LEONARD:
Wait a minute.

16:10.396 --> 16:12.630
Sheldon spent a whole day
with James Earl Jones

16:12.632 --> 16:13.898
and never told any of us.

16:13.900 --> 16:15.766
I sure did.

16:15.768 --> 16:17.201
Oh, my goodness!

16:17.203 --> 16:20.437
Well, from Jabba's head
to ice cream with Darth Vader,

16:20.439 --> 16:22.673
I'm having a heck of a ride.

16:22.675 --> 16:23.707
Yeah, look,

16:23.709 --> 16:25.075
clearly, good
things happen

16:25.077 --> 16:26.477
when I'm in charge.

16:26.479 --> 16:27.745
Now, why don't

16:27.747 --> 16:30.748
you boys step aside,
let me knock this project out?

16:30.750 --> 16:31.916
Sheldon,

16:31.918 --> 16:33.083
you're not in charge.

16:33.085 --> 16:34.385
Raj is in charge.

16:34.387 --> 16:36.520
Leonard, who's
really in charge?

16:36.522 --> 16:41.125
The person in charge, or
those who put him in charge?

16:41.127 --> 16:42.426
He's right.

16:42.428 --> 16:44.662
If you think about it,
we're all in charge.

16:44.664 --> 16:46.196
No, the guy in charge is in...

16:46.198 --> 16:49.166
Why is everyone so bad
at these?!

16:50.269 --> 16:52.102
I mean, the whole experience
reminded me

16:52.104 --> 16:54.305
about how much
I hated about that world.

16:54.307 --> 16:56.674
You-you know, the anxiety,
the depression, the negativity.

16:56.676 --> 16:58.676
I don't want
to feel those things.

16:58.678 --> 17:02.913
I want to sell drugs to people
who feel those things.

17:02.915 --> 17:05.214
I can't believe you got up
and walked out

17:05.217 --> 17:07.417
of an audition for a big movie.

17:07.420 --> 17:08.685
I did.

17:08.688 --> 17:10.521
I-I mean, I walked in,
read for the part,

17:10.522 --> 17:12.957
then stunk up the place,
but then I walked right out.

17:13.858 --> 17:15.059
Well, I'm glad

17:15.060 --> 17:17.094
you have a new
appreciation for your job.

17:17.096 --> 17:18.862
I do, and you know,
I don't think

17:18.864 --> 17:20.964
I've ever thanked you properly
for helping me get it.

17:20.967 --> 17:22.733
Properly, at all.

17:22.734 --> 17:25.868
It's just words
I've never heard.

17:25.871 --> 17:27.003
Well, thank you.

17:27.006 --> 17:29.139
You're a good friend,
and you changed my life.

17:29.141 --> 17:30.708
You're welcome.

17:30.710 --> 17:32.376
Hey, now that
you're making some real money,

17:32.378 --> 17:34.878
maybe you can take your friend
out for a nice thank-you dinner.

17:34.880 --> 17:37.414
Sure.

17:37.416 --> 17:39.216
And you probably have
to invite your other friend

17:39.218 --> 17:40.618
'cause she overheard you
talking about it,

17:40.620 --> 17:42.686
and it would be awkward
to exclude her.

17:42.688 --> 17:44.622
Okay.

17:44.624 --> 17:45.723
How about now?

17:45.725 --> 17:47.992
All right.

17:50.162 --> 17:51.695
Don't forget your wallet.

17:51.697 --> 17:53.864
I... (groans)

18:04.588 --> 18:07.122
Greetings from planet Earth.

18:08.693 --> 18:10.826
Just turn left
at Alpha Centauri.

18:10.828 --> 18:12.861
You can't miss it.
