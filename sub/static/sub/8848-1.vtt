00:45.896 --> 00:49.658
Unburden
yourself, my son.

00:52.005 --> 00:54.862
I was with General Sherman
on his march south.

00:57.202 --> 00:59.199
What we did...

01:01.016 --> 01:05.562
Evil... unspeakable things.

01:05.784 --> 01:07.669
You were a soldier.

01:07.736 --> 01:11.374
You were
following orders.

01:14.385 --> 01:16.147
No.

01:16.214 --> 01:18.568
No, not just orders.

01:20.219 --> 01:25.998
We opened a dark door...
And the devil stepped in.

01:26.041 --> 01:28.546
The only way to
cast out the devil...

01:28.606 --> 01:32.237
Is to confess to God.

01:33.592 --> 01:35.407
No.

01:36.364 --> 01:38.473
No, I can't, father.

01:39.784 --> 01:42.611
Tell me about Meridian.

01:46.229 --> 01:48.249
How do you know
about Meridian?

==SPREAD THE WORD==

03:04.667 --> 03:10.940
A nation which nearly
destroyed itself by Civil War

03:10.998 --> 03:15.262
between north and south
can only be healed

03:15.326 --> 03:20.040
by the binding together
of east and west.

03:21.508 --> 03:24.252
Mark my words, gentlemen,

03:24.320 --> 03:26.639
it will be built.

03:26.678 --> 03:29.689
The only question
which remains is...

03:29.758 --> 03:38.499
Which one of you will join
me in this mad, noble quest?

03:38.557 --> 03:43.854
Who among you will have
to say in years hence

03:43.946 --> 03:50.360
that he stood idly by as
this nation became an empire?

03:51.698 --> 03:56.879
And who among you will be
able to say he lent a hand

03:56.961 --> 04:01.696
in making manifest our
destiny as a great nation?

04:01.750 --> 04:03.379
Here, here.

04:10.201 --> 04:12.801
Bravo.

04:12.874 --> 04:14.981
It's all horse crap.

04:15.047 --> 04:17.983
The faster I shovel,
the faster they eat it up.

04:18.046 --> 04:19.882
But it was a truly
inspirational speech.

04:19.885 --> 04:22.906
Twattle and shy, I say.

04:22.987 --> 04:25.721
Then why am I here?

04:25.767 --> 04:29.560
You are here
to play your part.

04:33.986 --> 04:35.914
Credit mobilier.

04:35.991 --> 04:39.039
Credit mobilier
will be awarded

04:39.083 --> 04:42.998
all major construction contracts
on the Union Pacific railroad.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.627
I own it.

04:44.712 --> 04:47.749
I'm giving you the chance
to get in on the ground floor.

04:49.177 --> 04:50.775
So, you'll be
paying yourself

04:51.011 --> 04:54.767
to build a railroad with
government subsidies.

04:54.854 --> 04:57.111
Now that, my friend,
is inspirational.

04:57.189 --> 05:00.631
Yes, it is, but...

05:00.633 --> 05:04.864
I can't afford these
on a senator's salary.

05:04.945 --> 05:09.049
As head of the congressional
oversight committee on railroads,

05:09.273 --> 05:11.859
I'm sure you will
find a way to pay

05:11.929 --> 05:15.387
for them over and over
and over again.

05:15.454 --> 05:17.636
Might I ask how many
shares are here?

05:17.638 --> 05:19.791
200. I think you'll
find that's fair.

05:19.874 --> 05:22.177
400 sounds fairer.

05:24.056 --> 05:27.322
Are you trying
to renegotiate a bribe?

05:27.377 --> 05:32.297
No. Bribe is such
a dirty word. Hmm?

05:32.400 --> 05:35.011
Why don't you think
on it, doc, hmm?

05:35.090 --> 05:38.812
Ahem. We've got to vote before
the committee next Tuesday.

05:38.901 --> 05:43.401
Good luck with your land
speculation in Nebraska.

05:43.460 --> 05:49.146
Oh, 50,000 acres bought
on the cheap, hmm?

05:50.481 --> 05:53.937
What would happen
to the value of that land

05:54.063 --> 05:57.648
if I decided to route
the railroad around it?

06:01.080 --> 06:03.670
Take the stocks, Jordan.

06:08.652 --> 06:12.491
But I've decided
to renegotiate.

06:16.331 --> 06:18.712
100 shares.

06:25.687 --> 06:34.523
"He was gun... gunned...

06:34.669 --> 06:37.363

06:38.704 --> 06:39.865

06:39.956 --> 06:41.358
I... I was getting it.

06:43.525 --> 06:45.160
"Prayed...

06:49.915 --> 06:52.051

06:53.913 --> 06:55.377
Conference.

06:55.424 --> 06:57.891
Prayed
in the conference?

06:59.722 --> 07:02.488
Confessional.

07:02.545 --> 07:05.876
Someone killed the poor bugger
whilst he was confessing?

07:05.925 --> 07:08.889
What is the world
coming to, eh?

07:08.939 --> 07:12.493
Well, I suppose
the only consolation

07:12.555 --> 07:16.084
is that he got to heaven
that much faster.

07:16.156 --> 07:18.431
How did you come
by that conclusion?

07:18.563 --> 07:20.889
Well, he confessed
his sins.

07:20.943 --> 07:22.751
He died in Grace.

07:22.836 --> 07:29.725
So... God just up and punches
his ticket to heaven, huh?

07:29.763 --> 07:32.074
Well, yeah.

07:33.258 --> 07:34.760
If that's how God goes
about his business,

07:34.786 --> 07:36.079
you can keep him.

07:36.082 --> 07:37.913
Keep God?

07:37.956 --> 07:40.586
Do you not believe
in a higher power?

07:40.630 --> 07:43.579
Yes, sir, I wear it
on my hip.

07:47.191 --> 07:49.755
Are you a gunslinger then?

07:51.481 --> 07:52.782
No.

07:52.872 --> 07:54.747
I was just heading out west,

07:54.749 --> 07:57.356
looking for work
on the railroad.

07:57.358 --> 07:59.032
Yeah, so are we.

07:59.095 --> 08:03.581
To seek our fortune,
as it were.

08:03.644 --> 08:07.453
I'm Mickey and
this here's Sean.

08:07.539 --> 08:09.776
Cullen Bohannon.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.716
Mickey has 12 toes.

08:14.783 --> 08:16.164
And Sean but 8.

08:16.250 --> 08:18.295
Individually,
we're freaks.

08:18.340 --> 08:20.123
But together,
we're whole.

08:38.972 --> 08:45.326
** There's a bullet in
my pocket burning a hole **

08:46.665 --> 08:49.375
** It's so far
from your weapon **

08:49.450 --> 08:51.987
** the place
where you're born **

08:53.369 --> 08:58.995
** there's a bullet in
my pocket burning a hole **

09:00.611 --> 09:05.856
** you're so far from your weapon
and you wanna go home **

09:07.668 --> 09:13.352
** I tried to give you whiskey
but it never did work **

09:15.112 --> 09:19.609
** Suddenly you're begging
me to do so much work **

09:19.675 --> 09:22.278
** suddenly you're begging
me to do so much work **

09:22.343 --> 09:26.348
** right away from the get
go, the bullet was cursed **

09:26.403 --> 09:29.452
** right away from the get
go, the bullet was cursed **

09:29.522 --> 09:33.829
** ever since I had you,
every little thing hurts **

09:33.877 --> 09:36.023
** ever since I had you,
every little thing hurts **

09:36.077 --> 09:39.527
** you wanna get up,
let go, I said no **

09:39.581 --> 09:41.966
** you wanna get up, let go

09:42.036 --> 09:43.881
ohh!

09:48.890 --> 09:50.876
Next.

09:53.716 --> 09:55.346
Name?

09:55.394 --> 10:00.220
Cullen Bohannon.

10:01.332 --> 10:03.367
Railroad experience?

10:03.573 --> 10:05.584
None.

10:07.119 --> 10:09.007
Why should I hire you?

10:09.247 --> 10:12.060
I'm willing to do
just about anything.

10:12.121 --> 10:16.457
Uh-huh, you and
a thousand others.

10:18.868 --> 10:22.254
I ain't got no place
else to go, sir.

10:23.340 --> 10:25.266
Save it.

10:25.354 --> 10:27.085
Will you work the cut crew?

10:27.134 --> 10:28.339
Yeah.

10:28.486 --> 10:30.761
Yeah?

10:32.388 --> 10:33.616
What's the cut crew?

10:33.688 --> 10:35.739
Oh, it's brutal work.

10:35.741 --> 10:39.222
It is not for
the faint of heart.

10:39.280 --> 10:43.109
It gets hotter than a whore
house on nickel night out there.

10:44.110 --> 10:46.483
I ain't afraid
of hard work.

10:46.485 --> 10:49.100
You're a Johnny reb,
aren't you?

10:49.150 --> 10:50.614
Yes, sir.

10:50.708 --> 10:53.242
I could tell by that
griswold you're carrying.

10:53.299 --> 10:57.281
It was a griswold like
that that took off my hand.

10:58.793 --> 11:01.497
We all paid a price,
Mr. Bohannon,

11:01.580 --> 11:05.062
and I imagine you bare
your own scars.

11:05.119 --> 11:08.313
I was a copperhead
before the war.

11:08.393 --> 11:11.732
So, I... I bear no hard feelings
towards you graybacks.

11:11.801 --> 11:13.487
You did what you had to do.

11:13.569 --> 11:16.642
It's the darkies I blame.

11:16.644 --> 11:20.814
The way I see it, they only
fire more than just a hand.

11:22.190 --> 11:28.473
Say, did you own
slaves, Mr. Bohannon?

11:30.308 --> 11:31.676
I did.

11:31.931 --> 11:36.656
Well, then... I imagine you know
your way around a n.

11:55.269 --> 11:57.770
This is Mr. Bohannon...

11:57.838 --> 12:00.267
Your walking boss.

12:00.341 --> 12:05.205
You can address him as boss
or boss man or walking boss.

12:05.277 --> 12:09.699
Mr. Bohannon is a
former master of slaves.

12:11.695 --> 12:14.319
Some things don't never change.

12:14.365 --> 12:16.545
So, he's up to your tricks.

12:16.621 --> 12:19.453
He's going to work the blue
out of your gums, boys.

12:19.533 --> 12:22.545
Any coffee boilers or
otherwise slack work ethic

12:22.634 --> 12:24.549
will be dealt with severely.

12:24.635 --> 12:27.383
Now, dig me a cut.

12:35.257 --> 12:38.392
** Pass me not,
o gentle savior **

12:38.475 --> 12:43.681
Jesus Christ, accept this humble
servant into your heart.

12:43.729 --> 12:50.521
** Hear my humble cry

12:50.573 --> 12:54.025
** while on others
thou art calling... **

12:54.072 --> 12:55.363
be reborn...

12:55.406 --> 12:57.753
In the glory of Jesus.

12:57.832 --> 13:04.905
** Do not pass me by

13:04.960 --> 13:06.507
** savior...

13:06.575 --> 13:12.741
Brother Joseph... your
sins are washed away.

13:12.796 --> 13:18.265
** Hear my humble cry

13:19.626 --> 13:24.929
** Oh, what a beautiful city

13:24.977 --> 13:31.365
** oh, what a beautiful city

13:31.426 --> 13:36.566
** oh, what a beautiful city

13:36.619 --> 13:40.868
** 12 gates to the city...

13:40.941 --> 13:42.440
Whoa! Whoa!

13:42.488 --> 13:44.989
Whoa, whoa.
Easy, easy, boy.

13:45.077 --> 13:49.006
** There's 3 gates
in the east **

13:49.092 --> 13:52.714
** there's 3 gates
in the west **

13:52.798 --> 13:53.988
right here.

13:53.990 --> 13:56.285
** There's 3 gates
in the north **

13:56.339 --> 13:57.653
I love the tent.

13:57.721 --> 13:58.972
** And there's 3 gates
in the south... **

13:59.059 --> 14:00.275
raise the church.

14:00.326 --> 14:02.722
In this den
of thieves,

14:02.797 --> 14:05.902
I shall build a
house of the lord.

14:05.967 --> 14:07.802
You putting up
a church here?

14:12.967 --> 14:16.657
What better place to convert
the wicked, sister.

14:16.739 --> 14:20.667
** Won't you do
this kind of favor... **

14:20.748 --> 14:22.253
you better keep an eye
on your flock, reverend.

14:22.322 --> 14:24.919
We do our own share of
convertin' around here.

14:24.990 --> 14:29.124
** Please tell my mother

14:29.171 --> 14:34.462
why have you made
my roads so straight?

14:34.522 --> 14:37.194
Are we not in a race
with the central pacific?

14:37.216 --> 14:38.850
The central pacific?

14:38.896 --> 14:41.507
Those imbeciles will never
make it out of Sacramento.

14:41.554 --> 14:45.989
They're so desperate, I hear
they're hiring chinks.

14:46.056 --> 14:56.192
What I was thinking... was
something more like... this.

14:57.535 --> 15:00.024
But we're building
over a flat land,

15:00.026 --> 15:02.169
why wouldn't
we make it straight?

15:02.223 --> 15:07.210
Why wouldn't we make it
straight he asks?

15:07.243 --> 15:09.576
Take a closer look.

15:12.392 --> 15:13.550
Uh!

15:13.640 --> 15:15.251
Let me elucidate.

15:15.253 --> 15:18.571
In case you haven't
heard, this undertaking

15:18.636 --> 15:22.050
is being subsidized by the enormous
teat of the federal government.

15:22.052 --> 15:25.058
This never-ending,
money-gushing nipple

15:25.061 --> 15:28.334
pays me
$16,000 per mile,

15:28.391 --> 15:32.514
yet, you build
my road straight!

15:37.834 --> 15:39.956
You're fired.
Get out.

15:41.668 --> 15:45.802
I said, get out.

15:51.469 --> 15:55.283
You look like
a bright young man.

16:27.391 --> 16:29.553
This land...

16:29.631 --> 16:32.830
It's bewitching.

16:32.877 --> 16:37.704
It hasn't changed since Lewis and
Clark first saw it 60 years ago.

16:37.751 --> 16:41.150
Do you ever wonder
if our work here will...

16:41.222 --> 16:43.635
Will be the ruin
of all of this?

16:43.704 --> 16:46.260
Progress comes
with a cost, lily.

16:46.359 --> 16:50.454
I just think it's so much more
beautiful without people.

16:51.209 --> 16:52.715
Don't fool yourself.

16:52.776 --> 16:54.151
There are plenty
of people here.

16:54.225 --> 16:57.342
We're entering
Cheyenne territory.

16:57.344 --> 16:58.712
You do remember
our agreement?

17:00.076 --> 17:01.656
You mean our agreement
to regarding

17:01.741 --> 17:03.953
my not leaving your side
while you were ill?

17:03.955 --> 17:05.192
No.

17:05.259 --> 17:06.618
Ahem.

17:06.671 --> 17:11.714
I mean, our agreement
that you should go back

17:11.770 --> 17:15.589
to Chicago once we entered
hostile Indian territory.

17:16.791 --> 17:19.103
Yes, my dear, but it was
before you took ill.

17:19.180 --> 17:20.718
Yeah.

17:20.868 --> 17:23.348
I believe our second agreement
supersedes our first.

17:23.415 --> 17:26.087
Oh, dear God, now you
sound like a lawyer.

17:26.094 --> 17:30.376
If you want me to go
to Chicago... lead the way.

17:31.363 --> 17:34.361
I'm not leaving
without you, Robert.

17:34.439 --> 17:36.997
Don't tempt me, lily.
I might just do it.

17:38.610 --> 17:40.925
You play me for dumb.

17:40.990 --> 17:45.571
Ahh, you've worked for this
for too long to go back now.

17:45.620 --> 17:49.297
We've worked at this.

17:49.384 --> 17:53.107
This... this would
mean nothing to me

17:53.158 --> 17:56.165
if you weren't
here to share it.

18:03.288 --> 18:08.173
Robert Bell, are you hiding
something in your trousers?

18:10.298 --> 18:12.970
It must be all
this fresh air.

18:13.016 --> 18:14.261
Mmm.

18:14.314 --> 18:16.987
Mmm. Breathe deeply.

18:58.278 --> 19:02.525
So, uh, how many
slaves did you own?

19:04.350 --> 19:06.153
5 in all.

19:06.204 --> 19:08.360
I had me a small
tobacco farm.

19:08.407 --> 19:10.637
Any women?

19:10.639 --> 19:13.041
2.

19:13.130 --> 19:17.696
You ever, uh...
Sample the goods?

19:18.860 --> 19:23.234
Uh-uh.
It wasn't like that.

19:25.932 --> 19:27.374
Call.

19:28.723 --> 19:33.268
You, uh... bitter that
you had to give up your slaves?

19:34.939 --> 19:37.484
I gave them their freedom a
year before the war started.

19:37.559 --> 19:39.490
Are you serious?

19:39.576 --> 19:42.349
I kept them on at wages.

19:42.422 --> 19:43.985
Ha ha.

19:44.052 --> 19:46.699
You are an odd duck,
Bohannon.

19:46.743 --> 19:49.088
I married a northerner.

19:49.161 --> 19:52.046
She convinced me
of the evils of slavery.

19:52.048 --> 19:57.348
So, you... you
released your slaves,

19:57.410 --> 19:59.166
yet you still
fought in the war.

19:59.301 --> 20:00.900
Why?

20:00.966 --> 20:03.593
Honor.

20:08.465 --> 20:12.259
The southerner
and his honor.

20:13.468 --> 20:15.755
Where is your wife now?

20:17.540 --> 20:20.109
She's dead.

20:23.487 --> 20:25.607
Did the war take her?

20:30.436 --> 20:32.935
Something like that.

20:48.636 --> 20:50.571
Think they heard us?

20:50.638 --> 20:53.503
Who cares?

20:53.563 --> 20:57.116
I don't want to torment
the poor bastards

20:57.245 --> 20:59.588
out here alone in the
middle of nowhere.

20:59.655 --> 21:01.984
They have their hands.

21:03.477 --> 21:04.762
Ohh.

21:06.237 --> 21:09.663
Shh. Shh.

21:12.669 --> 21:14.004
Shh.

21:14.006 --> 21:17.428
I feel this cough is going
to be the death of me.

21:17.512 --> 21:19.632
Nonsense.

21:19.848 --> 21:22.250
Nonsense.

21:22.386 --> 21:26.543
Lily... if I were
to die...

21:26.609 --> 21:33.293
Robert... please... please
don't talk like that.

21:33.518 --> 21:35.686
Don't talk like that.

22:25.429 --> 22:26.892
Oh!

22:38.778 --> 22:40.671
The map.

22:40.737 --> 22:43.069
We have to save
their work.

22:52.583 --> 22:54.347
Run to the trees.

22:54.412 --> 22:56.758
Don't look back.

23:39.054 --> 23:40.623
Shh, shh, shh.

23:41.960 --> 23:43.308
Shh, shh, shh.

24:05.150 --> 24:06.318
Uhh!

24:06.369 --> 24:07.668
Uh!

24:12.341 --> 24:15.006
No, please no.

24:15.089 --> 24:17.826
Ah! Aah!

24:18.926 --> 24:21.005
Aah!

24:26.853 --> 24:29.174
Aah!

24:36.844 --> 24:38.034
Robert!

27:04.257 --> 27:07.217
Rise and shine, Bohannon.

27:09.378 --> 27:14.027
It's another beautiful day
on the railroad.

27:21.507 --> 27:22.690
Get up!

27:22.905 --> 27:24.220
Uhh.

27:24.399 --> 27:27.491
Get up! Come on!

27:27.538 --> 27:29.242
Whoa.

27:30.527 --> 27:33.039
My horse.

27:42.133 --> 27:44.549
All right, lad.

27:45.535 --> 27:47.384
Half-hour to lunch!

27:47.472 --> 27:48.832
Half-hour!

27:48.890 --> 27:50.708
Peckerwood.

27:52.039 --> 27:55.141
He ain't so bad.

27:55.214 --> 27:57.062
Shut your dumb
black ass up.

27:57.158 --> 27:59.741
I don't need no slave
boss motivatin' me.

27:59.811 --> 28:01.020
Mm-hmm.

28:03.431 --> 28:04.654
Come on!

28:04.715 --> 28:08.071
Help me out here.

28:08.157 --> 28:11.566
** All them pretty gals
gonna be there **

28:11.611 --> 28:15.170
** shuck that corn
before you eat **

28:15.237 --> 28:16.696
come on!

28:16.754 --> 28:19.204
Come on!

28:19.254 --> 28:23.172
I say... ** all them pretty
gals gonna be there **

28:23.244 --> 28:25.928
** shuck that corn
before you eat **

28:25.930 --> 28:29.263
** they gonna fix it
for us rare **

28:29.349 --> 28:31.592
** shuck that corn
before you eat **

28:31.678 --> 28:34.512
** I know that supper
gonna be big **

28:34.594 --> 28:37.267
** shuck that corn
before you eat **

28:37.354 --> 28:40.755
** I think I smell
a fire roast pig **

28:40.801 --> 28:43.308
** shuck that corn
before you eat **

28:45.422 --> 28:46.814
Keep it going.

28:50.612 --> 28:54.768
** I hope they got
some whiskey there **

29:17.012 --> 29:20.154
You might want to take
a look at this.

29:20.230 --> 29:22.095
Put it in the pile.

29:22.224 --> 29:23.884
No, sir.

29:25.464 --> 29:27.656
You really need
to look at this.

29:37.666 --> 29:39.991
Dear God.

29:41.273 --> 29:43.676
Robert Bell is dead?

29:52.125 --> 29:53.972
Is this
the entire message?

29:54.028 --> 29:55.395
Yes, sir.

29:56.679 --> 30:00.655
Nothing about...
Maps being found?

30:00.657 --> 30:02.371
No, sir.

30:03.506 --> 30:05.188
One last telegram.

30:07.674 --> 30:12.370
To the Union Pacific board
of directors... change of plans.

30:12.446 --> 30:16.562
Stop. Heading for hell
on wheels immediately. Stop.

30:16.627 --> 30:17.949
Send it.

30:29.297 --> 30:30.666
You need some water.

30:30.715 --> 30:35.132
No, it ain't... it ain't
break time yet.

30:35.203 --> 30:39.203
Come on, you need
some water. Come on.

30:43.543 --> 30:45.882
Come on.

30:47.234 --> 30:48.599
Unh.

30:54.409 --> 30:57.490
I thought I told you to dump
that dirt on the other side.

30:57.560 --> 30:59.245
Hey.
Shut your mouth.

30:59.327 --> 31:01.228
I told him to do it.

31:01.279 --> 31:04.196
We going to fill in that
dip over yonder next.

31:04.251 --> 31:07.082
I figured we might just use
some field dirt nearby.

31:10.341 --> 31:14.379
You talk to me before any
decisions are made, all right?

31:14.430 --> 31:16.583
Yes, sir, master.

31:16.625 --> 31:18.511
What did you say?

31:18.580 --> 31:21.548
Bohannon, what the hell
is going on here?

31:21.601 --> 31:23.599
You drink when
I tell you to drink!

31:26.437 --> 31:28.530
Uh!

31:28.594 --> 31:29.892
Get up!

31:29.943 --> 31:33.785
Willy! Willy! Willy!

31:33.859 --> 31:35.430
Willy!

31:37.365 --> 31:42.122
This is what happens
when you break my rules.

32:35.871 --> 32:39.857
Now, what you planning on doing
with that Arkansas toothpick, huh?

32:41.363 --> 32:43.567
Don't do it.

32:46.212 --> 32:52.577
We ain't on no plantation
no more... walking boss.

32:57.219 --> 33:00.697
Ain't nothing good
gonna come from this.

33:09.205 --> 33:10.926
Yeah.

33:11.079 --> 33:13.369
Well, there ain't nothing
good coming from this either.

33:13.413 --> 33:15.845
That dumb n
actually thought

33:15.847 --> 33:18.387
this was gonna
changed a thing.

33:21.262 --> 33:24.206
Look what that got him.

33:27.280 --> 33:30.963
Might just as well
wipe my ass with it.

33:39.912 --> 33:45.132
You kill him...
You will hang.

33:49.250 --> 33:52.500
How they gonna hang me if
there ain't no witnesses?

33:52.502 --> 33:56.049
You come to me
with a knife, son...

33:56.157 --> 33:58.274
You better be ready to use it.

34:12.761 --> 34:14.636
Yeah.

34:16.420 --> 34:19.947
You got to let
go of the past.

34:21.762 --> 34:24.007
Have you let it go?

35:04.349 --> 35:06.497
You doing quite a trade here.

35:06.499 --> 35:08.927
Not bad for a couple
of Irish bumpkins.

35:09.009 --> 35:10.594
Where's Mickey?

35:10.647 --> 35:15.248
He's preparing
for the grand finale.

35:29.348 --> 35:33.720
** When you're far away

35:33.774 --> 35:39.828
** far from the land
you'll be **

35:39.885 --> 35:47.306
do you not pine for your own
homeland, Mr. Bohannon?

35:49.470 --> 35:50.961
No.

35:52.809 --> 35:55.319
And why is that?

35:57.981 --> 35:59.575
It's gone.

35:59.577 --> 36:01.160
** Bright and fair

36:01.312 --> 36:04.997
** and rich in its treasures

36:05.081 --> 36:07.390
** Muldoon

36:16.711 --> 36:22.931
** Won't you come back soon

36:22.998 --> 36:28.974
** love you

36:32.007 --> 36:35.508
So, tell me, Bohannon...

36:35.720 --> 36:38.966
Did you see the elephant
during the war?

36:38.968 --> 36:41.624
Yes, I saw my share
of action, yeah.

36:41.626 --> 36:43.848
Where?

36:44.981 --> 36:47.851
Yeah. I don't like
to talk about it.

36:51.559 --> 36:53.851
I loved the war.

36:55.034 --> 36:57.490
I loved the war!

37:01.454 --> 37:05.035
The best thing that
ever happened to me.

37:06.264 --> 37:08.369
I thought you said
you were against it?

37:08.432 --> 37:10.333
Oh, yeah, I was.

37:10.400 --> 37:13.744
But... that
doesn't mean...

37:13.873 --> 37:18.350
That I didn't enjoy myself
once pressed into service.

37:18.417 --> 37:20.517
Hey!

37:20.519 --> 37:22.841
Oh, hey,
I'm... I'm skimped.

37:23.047 --> 37:26.427
No, no. This one's on me.

37:26.500 --> 37:30.879
Well... well, thank you.

37:37.286 --> 37:39.833
Most men shrink...

37:39.894 --> 37:42.659
When they see
the elephant up close.

37:42.810 --> 37:44.049
Oh, yeah?

37:44.196 --> 37:47.900
But I... I blossomed.

38:00.921 --> 38:02.910
Thank you.

38:04.059 --> 38:07.060
Though I...

38:07.118 --> 38:10.265
I must admit that
there were, um...

38:11.538 --> 38:13.965
Certain lines
that I crossed.

38:14.025 --> 38:18.919
Lines of morality that I didn't
think myself capable of crossing.

38:29.241 --> 38:33.439
But that's
what men do... in war.

38:33.494 --> 38:35.357
Hmm.

38:37.493 --> 38:39.949
Moral men don't.

38:43.549 --> 38:47.318
So, you did nothing that
you were ashamed of?

38:50.578 --> 38:54.141
I did plenty I was ashamed of.

39:03.179 --> 39:06.705
You ever been to Meridian,
Mississippi, Mr. Johnson?

39:12.790 --> 39:16.348
That is my remington
pointed at your gut.

39:16.413 --> 39:20.837
So... let's take
a walk out back.

39:28.009 --> 39:33.775
I know about the 2 men
you killed in Maryland.

39:33.842 --> 39:35.698
I read in the paper
about Prescott

39:35.778 --> 39:39.943
getting killed in that
church by a griswold.

39:41.282 --> 39:43.361
But I'll be damned
if you didn't show up

39:43.397 --> 39:45.990
a few days later with a griswold
strapped to your hip as plain as day.

39:46.026 --> 39:50.898
And then you ask me about
Meridian? That's sensitive.

39:52.017 --> 39:54.961
Mmm! I am not proud

39:55.021 --> 39:58.093
of what happened
to your wife, Bohannon.

39:58.153 --> 40:00.639
It didn't happen to her.

40:00.718 --> 40:03.030
You did it to her.

40:04.468 --> 40:07.885
Yes. Yes,
we did it to her.

40:07.975 --> 40:10.546
I did it to her.

40:11.981 --> 40:16.212
Your wife was in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

40:19.591 --> 40:22.437
I want you to know...

40:22.578 --> 40:26.404
It wasn't my idea
to kill her.

40:26.449 --> 40:29.403
She hung herself?

40:30.573 --> 40:32.529
No, she didn't.

40:32.592 --> 40:36.100
The sergeant strangled
her and strung her up.

40:36.104 --> 40:38.007
Sergeant?

40:38.087 --> 40:40.407
What sergeant?

40:42.218 --> 40:43.705
Well,
he's out here, too.

40:43.760 --> 40:46.589
I figured you were
saving him for last.

40:49.932 --> 40:53.361
Oh, you didn't
know about it?

40:53.433 --> 40:55.418
You tell me who he is.

40:55.491 --> 40:57.436
Well, it hardly
matters now.

40:57.638 --> 40:59.089
No!

41:07.974 --> 41:09.400
Tell me his name.

41:12.605 --> 41:14.281
Tell me his name.

41:25.151 --> 41:26.824
Is it a villain you want?

41:26.911 --> 41:28.952
I'll play the part.

41:33.276 --> 41:36.059
After all, what is a
drama without a villain?

41:36.298 --> 41:42.474
What is the building of this
grand road if not a drama?

41:44.327 --> 41:48.315
This business is not
for the weak of heart.

41:49.347 --> 41:52.295
It's a thorny,
brutal affair

41:52.346 --> 41:57.469
that rewards the lion
for his ferocity.

41:58.468 --> 42:00.317
What of the zebra?

42:00.450 --> 42:02.739
What of the poor zebra?

42:02.801 --> 42:06.975
Well, the zebra's eaten
as the zebra should be.

42:08.360 --> 42:11.409
Make no mistake.
Blood will be spilled.

42:11.484 --> 42:13.497
Lives will be lost.

42:13.583 --> 42:15.250
Fortunes will be made.

42:15.319 --> 42:17.249
Men will be ruined.

42:17.319 --> 42:21.840
There will be
betrayal and scandal.

42:21.893 --> 42:24.422
A perfidy
of epic proportions.

42:24.424 --> 42:31.678
But... the lion
shall prevail.

42:33.103 --> 42:38.137
You see, the secret
I know is this...

42:38.191 --> 42:44.018
All of history
is driven by the lion.

42:44.067 --> 42:49.535
We drag the poor zebra
kicking and braying.

42:51.236 --> 42:57.054
Stain the earth
with his cheap blood.

42:57.127 --> 43:02.300
History doesn't
remember us fondly,

43:02.362 --> 43:06.542
but then history is written
by the zebra for the zebra.

43:09.370 --> 43:12.875
100 years hence...

43:12.923 --> 43:17.211
When this railroad
spans the continent

43:17.270 --> 43:22.692
and America rises to be the greatest
power the world has seen...

43:22.738 --> 43:31.899
I will be remembered
as a caitiff...

43:31.946 --> 43:34.499
Malefactor...

43:34.559 --> 43:39.835
