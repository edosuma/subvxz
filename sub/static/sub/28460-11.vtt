WEBVTT

00:04.750 --> 00:06.888
_

00:07.007 --> 00:09.490
Edna, it is great to see you.

00:09.576 --> 00:12.210
This is crazy, I mean,
you clean my mom's house

00:12.245 --> 00:14.963
and now you're gonna clean
this house. (CHUCKLES)

00:15.048 --> 00:17.409
You really took us
on a ride there, Greg.

00:17.434 --> 00:18.600
Yeah, well, I'm excited.

00:18.625 --> 00:20.708
- I mean, she-she watched me grow up.
- Mm-hmm.

00:20.921 --> 00:23.360
Your kids masturbating into socks yet?

00:23.385 --> 00:25.089
Oh. (LAUGHS)

00:25.114 --> 00:27.250
That-that, that
w-wasn't me, that was,

00:27.275 --> 00:29.394
that was Matthew or possibly Heather.

00:29.711 --> 00:32.023
Uh, any other questions,

00:32.048 --> 00:35.160
you know, about, uh, the
house or our expectations?

00:35.185 --> 00:36.434
Nope.

00:36.519 --> 00:39.552
See? She's easygoing,
she is low-maintenance,

00:39.577 --> 00:41.950
she is Edna.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.019
Well, listen, we're so
glad you're available.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.543
Managing two kids and two careers,

00:45.568 --> 00:46.970
this place is always a wreck.

00:47.005 --> 00:50.006
Yeah, and if you can keep
this house as crisp and sharp

00:50.092 --> 00:52.425
as the creases you iron
into my dad's jeans,

00:52.450 --> 00:55.137
- pfft... we'll be in business a long time.
- Great.

00:55.162 --> 00:56.930
What time do you want
me to be here tomorrow?

00:57.015 --> 00:58.265
Nothing's too early.

00:58.290 --> 01:00.183
You just tell us when
to have our robes on.

01:00.269 --> 01:03.488
Or in Greg's case, his sock off.

01:06.859 --> 01:08.191
Edna?

01:08.216 --> 01:09.465
We're home.

01:09.578 --> 01:12.412
Ooh, I can smell the floor polish.

01:12.497 --> 01:15.621
Yeah, I spilled some
on the couch, sorry.

01:15.646 --> 01:17.832
It's wet now, but it'll dry hard.

01:17.857 --> 01:20.086
Well, there goes our
movie night. (CHUCKLING)

01:20.172 --> 01:22.672
Oh, I can't stay, anyway, and honestly

01:22.708 --> 01:24.674
I can't stand the smell.

01:24.699 --> 01:26.938
- See you next week.
- GREG: Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:26.962 --> 01:28.791
What do you think you're doing?

01:28.816 --> 01:30.024
- Come on, bring it on in.
- Oh.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.800
- (LAUGHING)
- Ah, thank you so much, Edna.

01:31.825 --> 01:33.800
- You're the best.
- All right. (LAUGHS)

01:33.886 --> 01:35.302
There she goes... first

01:35.387 --> 01:38.077
valid inductee to the
Housekeeper Hall of Fame!

01:38.102 --> 01:39.272
(CHUCKLING)

01:39.358 --> 01:41.391
See? I told you. She
may have shown up late,

01:41.476 --> 01:42.642
but she left on time.

01:43.065 --> 01:44.659
God.

01:45.063 --> 01:47.314
Greg, the house looks no different

01:47.399 --> 01:49.032
than it did when we left this morning,

01:49.067 --> 01:50.734
aside from the stain on our couch.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.619
She did say that she hates dirt,

01:52.704 --> 01:54.431
and clearly she's been avoiding it.

01:54.456 --> 01:57.763
Okay, it looks like she made a
batch of cookies and ate them.

01:57.788 --> 01:59.551
Oh, right. She's always
had a sweet tooth.

01:59.576 --> 02:01.827
- It's her only vice.
- (GROANING)

02:02.685 --> 02:05.238
Oh, and she also drank the good Scotch.

02:05.263 --> 02:07.115
It's her other only vice.

02:07.563 --> 02:09.310
She didn't even make the bed.

02:09.335 --> 02:12.172
No, wait. I made the bed before we left.

02:12.257 --> 02:14.090
Greg, she took a nap.

02:14.176 --> 02:17.203
Well, let's see you drink four
fingers of Scotch and stay up.

02:17.249 --> 02:19.346
- Are you defending her?
- No.

02:19.431 --> 02:20.931
You're right, okay?

02:21.391 --> 02:23.364
I mean, she's got a great vibe, but

02:23.389 --> 02:25.672
she apparently has lost her touch.

02:29.754 --> 02:31.170
Hi, Joan.

02:31.195 --> 02:34.391
Listen, I was wondering if I
could talk to you about Edna.

02:34.416 --> 02:37.247
Oh, she's got a great vibe, doesn't she?

02:37.282 --> 02:39.916
She does, yeah, and, you know, we were

02:39.952 --> 02:42.619
really excited about having
a great cleaning lady.

02:42.704 --> 02:46.756
The thing is, at our house, it
turns out, she's just a lady,

02:46.792 --> 02:47.958
and not even that.

02:48.093 --> 02:50.010
I mean, sh-she doesn't even flush.

02:50.045 --> 02:53.263
Oh, well, there are some
quirks you have to work around.

02:53.298 --> 02:55.215
Now, where did I put the duster?

02:55.300 --> 02:56.913
Here it is, right in front of me.

02:56.938 --> 02:58.711
What are you doing?
Doesn't Edna do that?

02:58.766 --> 03:00.381
Oh, brilliantly.

03:00.406 --> 03:02.555
That's how I learned, by watching her,

03:02.641 --> 03:05.811
but she really doesn't reach
above her shoulders anymore.

03:05.836 --> 03:07.644
Oh. Is that, like, a health thing?

03:07.729 --> 03:10.063
No, no, that's an attitude thing.

03:10.367 --> 03:12.649
But she excels at cleaning things

03:12.734 --> 03:14.985
between chest and knees.

03:15.217 --> 03:17.537
- That's the Edna pocket.
- Hmm, yeah.

03:17.622 --> 03:19.372
That would make sense, 'cause our Scotch

03:19.458 --> 03:21.124
was in the Edna pocket.

03:21.159 --> 03:24.837
Oh, well, generally, if you
hide it behind something,

03:24.862 --> 03:26.503
she'll miss it.

03:26.528 --> 03:29.361
(WHISPERING): Hey, keep it
down. You're gonna wake Edna.

03:29.386 --> 03:31.384
What? She's here now?

03:31.470 --> 03:33.169
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's her cleaning day.

03:33.255 --> 03:35.005
But you're the one
doing all the cleaning.

03:35.090 --> 03:36.639
I mean, does she do anything?

03:36.675 --> 03:39.092
- Well, she ironed John's jeans.
- Oh, yeah.

03:39.177 --> 03:40.927
Yeah. I could wear these to church.

03:41.013 --> 03:44.147
But right now, you know, I'm
just gonna wear 'em to the gym.

03:44.182 --> 03:47.400
Look at the edge on this. You
could cut a steak with them.

03:49.521 --> 03:50.987
GREG (SIGHS): Okay, well,

03:51.023 --> 03:52.522
I put both kids to bed.

03:52.607 --> 03:55.325
Great. And I put Edna to bed.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.527
On the air mattress? With her bad back?

03:57.612 --> 04:00.914
What? No. Greg, she's not
sleeping here. I-I fired her.

04:00.999 --> 04:03.033
You fired her? Wh-Why?

04:03.118 --> 04:05.335
Because, you said it
yourself, she's lost her touch.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.037
I mean, she is terrible.

04:07.122 --> 04:09.005
I thought she just wasn't
doing anything here.

04:09.041 --> 04:11.624
Turns out, she's not
doing anything anywhere.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.426
But she's like family.

04:13.512 --> 04:15.295
What if, with all of your imperfections,

04:15.380 --> 04:17.545
I just decided to fire you?

04:17.570 --> 04:19.099
Yeah, that-that-that
came out wrong.

04:19.184 --> 04:23.136
I'm just saying, she's more than
just a cleaning person to us.

04:23.221 --> 04:26.391
Greg, we don't need more
than a cleaning person.

04:26.416 --> 04:29.859
- We need a cleaning person.
- (SIGHS)

04:29.895 --> 04:32.578
JOAN: Jen, how could you fire Edna?

04:32.603 --> 04:34.174
She's family.

04:34.199 --> 04:36.877
- She's despondent. She can't clean.
- Yeah.

04:36.902 --> 04:38.401
She doesn't clean, though.

04:38.487 --> 04:39.953
That is the problem.

04:40.038 --> 04:41.321
This is terrible.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.373
She didn't touch the
dinner I made for her.

04:43.408 --> 04:45.075
- GREG (GASPS): It's that bad?
- Yeah.

04:45.100 --> 04:46.326
What are we gonna do?

04:46.351 --> 04:48.628
I mean, we should
throw her a Scotch party

04:48.713 --> 04:50.163
to get her out of her depression.

04:50.248 --> 04:52.633
Nope. Wrong direction. Not doing that.

04:52.658 --> 04:53.895
What does this woman have over you?

04:53.919 --> 04:56.169
I mean, I know she's got
the sock thing with Greg.

04:56.254 --> 04:58.088
Sock thing? (SCOFFS)

04:58.173 --> 05:00.423
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

05:00.509 --> 05:02.957
Oh, she's talking about you using socks

05:02.982 --> 05:04.865
- to explore your body.
- Yeah.

05:04.890 --> 05:06.930
- You-you knew about that?
- No.

05:07.015 --> 05:09.475
Jen, you are a good mother.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.250
You work very hard.

05:11.275 --> 05:13.408
You deserve a clean house.

05:14.247 --> 05:16.406
And I will take care of Edna.

05:17.377 --> 05:18.942
Thank you.

05:19.767 --> 05:20.735
Hi.

05:20.760 --> 05:22.330
GREG: Hey, babe.

05:23.674 --> 05:25.696
Place is looking pretty good, huh?

05:25.721 --> 05:26.721
(CLICKS TONGUE)

05:26.746 --> 05:29.506
What? This is how you took care of Edna?

05:29.531 --> 05:32.291
Shh, shh, shh, she's asleep.

05:33.971 --> 05:35.963
Is she wearing my sweatpants?

05:36.416 --> 05:37.684
Yeah.

05:37.824 --> 05:39.707
But she ironed 'em first.

05:41.882 --> 05:43.610
_

05:44.054 --> 05:46.219
I was just watching Antiques Roadshow,

05:46.304 --> 05:48.688
and the most exciting thing happened.

05:48.773 --> 05:50.273
Someone found out their old junk

05:50.308 --> 05:52.225
was worth slightly
more than they thought?

05:52.310 --> 05:54.227
No! Well, yes.

05:54.312 --> 05:55.501
But the point is,

05:55.526 --> 05:59.173
guy was showing off one of
those floaty pens, you know?

05:59.198 --> 06:00.792
The ones that I used to bring you

06:00.817 --> 06:02.462
from all those flights I logged.

06:02.487 --> 06:04.465
The only things I ever
remember you bringing us home

06:04.489 --> 06:06.217
from your trips were
exotic strains of the flu.

06:06.241 --> 06:07.746
No, the floaty pens.

06:07.771 --> 06:11.052
The one you-you tipped over,
and the girl's top slid off.

06:11.077 --> 06:13.163
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's right, I remember.

06:13.248 --> 06:17.050
It's the gift every girl dreams
of getting from her father.

06:17.135 --> 06:19.836
Well, now they're actually
worth a lot of money.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.254
So, go get yours.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.089
I want to display them.

06:23.175 --> 06:25.058
Oh, I have no idea where mine are.

06:25.143 --> 06:29.012
Yeah, and I gave mine to
Matt, so, good going, Matt.

06:29.097 --> 06:31.181
Dad, why do you think
that we would keep track

06:31.206 --> 06:32.815
of airport gift shop pens?

06:32.851 --> 06:36.186
Oh, I get it. I should've
given you collector's knives

06:36.271 --> 06:39.239
so you could have driven
them right into my heart.

06:41.516 --> 06:43.961
They used to sell collector's
knives in the airport?

06:44.759 --> 06:45.840
Huh.

06:47.616 --> 06:50.608
I told Jen, as long as Edna
gets six hours of sleep at night

06:50.633 --> 06:53.119
and a solid eight during
the day, she'll be fine.

06:53.205 --> 06:55.922
Oh, my kids. I need to talk to you.

06:56.007 --> 06:59.352
Your father is very
upset about those pens,

06:59.377 --> 07:02.805
and guess who gets to bear
the burden of that load.

07:02.830 --> 07:04.806
Thank you very much.

07:04.831 --> 07:06.498
- Mom, seriously?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

07:06.523 --> 07:08.217
I mean, why does Dad care so much

07:08.242 --> 07:11.638
about those cheap, trashy
pens that objectified women?

07:11.723 --> 07:13.356
Honey, it was a different time.

07:13.391 --> 07:15.642
A worse time, but still.

07:15.727 --> 07:18.061
Mom, Dad is totally
overreacting to all of this.

07:18.146 --> 07:21.281
He sent us all nasty e-mails
questioning our paternity.

07:21.589 --> 07:24.033
- What?
- I didn't get an e-mail.

07:24.776 --> 07:25.946
You didn't?

07:25.971 --> 07:27.065
No.

07:27.090 --> 07:29.799
You will. Sure he's just, you know,

07:29.824 --> 07:32.125
sending them out individually.

07:32.210 --> 07:34.043
(PHONE CHIMES)

07:34.688 --> 07:35.889
Just got another one.

07:35.914 --> 07:40.288
Those pens were your dad's way
of saying that he missed you

07:40.313 --> 07:41.883
and he loved you.

07:41.908 --> 07:45.735
Because saying that out
loud makes him feel "weird."

07:46.079 --> 07:47.640
- Well, now I feel terrible.
- Yeah.

07:47.726 --> 07:50.893
Yeah. All right, guys, we got
to try and find these things.

07:50.929 --> 07:53.601
- Yeah, all your stuff is in the garage.
- GREG: Okay.

07:56.054 --> 07:57.232
HEATHER: Oh!

07:57.257 --> 07:58.735
My books! (GASPS)

07:58.770 --> 08:01.679
I used to love to read.

08:01.961 --> 08:05.295
Do you remember when I was
gonna be a Supreme Court justice?

08:05.320 --> 08:07.115
I don't know what happened.

08:07.529 --> 08:08.717
Oh!

08:08.742 --> 08:10.280
My old bongs! Mm!

08:10.365 --> 08:12.855
Aw, sweet! My 'nocs!

08:12.880 --> 08:14.254
(LAUGHS): Oh, man!

08:14.279 --> 08:17.420
I used to peep the illest
birds with these bad boys.

08:17.455 --> 08:18.615
HEATHER: Yeah, you told us

08:18.640 --> 08:21.568
you used to use those to watch
Melanie Weber take showers.

08:21.593 --> 08:23.273
I just wanted you guys
to think I was cool.

08:23.593 --> 08:25.355
That's not what it made us think.

08:25.380 --> 08:27.351
So, this is the last box.

08:27.421 --> 08:31.301
That makes four "Heathers,"
six "Gregs," and zero "Matts."

08:31.408 --> 08:34.046
Always nice to take a trip
down memory lane in this family.

08:34.296 --> 08:35.638
Okay, well, two things are clear.

08:35.724 --> 08:38.039
Our parents kept nothing of Matthew's,

08:38.063 --> 08:40.264
and the nudie pens aren't here.

08:41.491 --> 08:43.332
HEATHER: Ooh! I found the pens.

08:43.357 --> 08:45.107
Oh, word? Where?

08:45.132 --> 08:49.462
On eBay, next to some very
sexually explicit candles.

08:49.487 --> 08:52.441
(CLEARS THROAT) You don't
strap on a candle, Heather.

08:52.466 --> 08:53.339
Oh.

08:53.364 --> 08:55.408
The set of pens is 700 bucks?

08:55.493 --> 08:57.077
- That's ridiculous.
- MATT: Yeah, no.

08:57.102 --> 08:58.711
Maybe Dad'll just forget about it.

08:58.797 --> 09:01.038
Ooh. I just got an
e-mail from Dad right now.

09:01.063 --> 09:03.549
- What does it say?
- I don't know. It's a photo montage.

09:03.635 --> 09:06.694
- ♪ Daddy's little girl ♪
- Oh! Oh, it's a picture of me as a baby.

09:06.719 --> 09:08.755
- ♪ Dancing on his feet... ♪
- (PHONE CHIMES)

09:08.840 --> 09:10.890
Oh. Hey, he just sent me a montage, too.

09:10.975 --> 09:14.394
Oh, no, no. It's just a picture
of a man holding me as a baby,

09:14.479 --> 09:16.813
but his face is a question mark.

09:16.848 --> 09:17.930
(CHUCKLES)

09:18.158 --> 09:20.683
He really did come to my softball game.

09:20.708 --> 09:22.408
Yeah, can you just,
like, pause this, Heather?

09:22.432 --> 09:24.570
Okay, you know what? We
are gonna buy these pens,

09:24.656 --> 09:26.105
because we owe it to Dad.

09:26.191 --> 09:28.491
Oh, hey, did anybody check this box?

09:31.830 --> 09:33.112
What?

09:33.198 --> 09:34.697
"Joan's Party Supplies."

09:34.783 --> 09:35.948
Oh.

09:36.034 --> 09:37.450
Oh.

09:37.535 --> 09:40.208
So, Mom has a set of those candles.

09:40.233 --> 09:41.649
- Hmm.
- (GROANS)

09:46.696 --> 09:48.845
Hey, Dad, great news! We found the pens!

09:48.880 --> 09:50.847
Yeah, it-it turns out we did keep them

09:50.882 --> 09:53.247
because, you know, we love you so much.

09:53.272 --> 09:55.881
Great. Let's see 'em.

09:56.959 --> 09:58.532
- They're getting cleaned right now.
- Yeah.

09:58.556 --> 10:02.125
But they should be here in
three to seven business days.

10:02.150 --> 10:04.564
- Meh.
- Or... even sooner.

10:04.891 --> 10:06.320
Hmm?

10:07.820 --> 10:09.565
You're the seller?

10:09.651 --> 10:11.983
We just bought the pens
back from our own father.

10:12.008 --> 10:13.046
Yep.

10:13.071 --> 10:16.155
You outbid some...
pretty eager perverts.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.407
Where did you find them?

10:17.492 --> 10:20.209
Perverts? They're all over the Internet.

10:20.245 --> 10:22.995
No, Dad, the pens. Where
did you find the pens?

10:23.081 --> 10:25.498
Oh, in Matt's box, in the garage.

10:25.583 --> 10:28.217
You guys did keep some
of my stuff? You...

10:30.409 --> 10:31.791
That's mine.

10:32.135 --> 10:33.362
You guys are great.

10:33.387 --> 10:34.768
Oh, Dad, thank you.

10:34.793 --> 10:37.760
And since you know how much we love you,

10:37.846 --> 10:39.479
maybe you could give us our money back.

10:40.259 --> 10:42.110
Take it up with eBay.

10:49.399 --> 10:52.665
Well, John, thank you so
much for watching Lucas.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.743
Oh, no problem.

10:54.829 --> 10:57.813
No, I-I read his fairy
tale book to him ten times.

10:57.838 --> 11:00.477
- Aw.
- I told him he was getting addicted.

11:00.502 --> 11:03.926
Well, that led into this
long talk about addiction.

11:03.951 --> 11:06.622
I never want to fall off a wagon.

11:06.707 --> 11:09.213
- Mm. Oh. Aw.
- Aw.

11:09.465 --> 11:11.765
Aw, you're leaving already?

11:11.790 --> 11:13.423
Can I have a hug?

11:14.394 --> 11:16.015
Lucas, go hug Mom-Mom.

11:16.050 --> 11:17.383
No, don't force him.

11:17.468 --> 11:19.101
Force him? He can't wait.

11:19.186 --> 11:20.769
(STRAINING)

11:20.855 --> 11:22.221
Please don't make me!

11:22.306 --> 11:24.723
Lucas. L-Lucas?

11:24.809 --> 11:27.276
Oh, he's just shy.

11:27.361 --> 11:31.025
Shy? We didn't run
into one person at lunch

11:31.050 --> 11:32.364
he didn't try to hug.

11:33.152 --> 11:35.401
Okay, thanks for getting it. Bye.

11:35.486 --> 11:37.093
Bye-bye, sweetie.

11:37.118 --> 11:41.446
Aw. Don't feel bad, Joanie.
I'm sure Lucas loves you.

11:41.688 --> 11:44.470
Well, uh, mm, you know, not real sure,

11:44.495 --> 11:47.629
but, uh, he doesn't talk crap about you.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.677
Oh, mercy, mercy, merc...

11:53.712 --> 11:54.795
Oh, kids!

11:54.880 --> 11:57.765
If you should happen to run across a box

11:57.800 --> 12:00.551
that's marked "Joan's Party Supplies,"

12:00.783 --> 12:03.667
for your continued mental stability,

12:04.087 --> 12:05.612
don't open it.

12:07.175 --> 12:08.369
Sure thing, Ma.

12:09.426 --> 12:11.204
Yeah, yeah.

12:11.915 --> 12:13.498
Lucas?

12:13.778 --> 12:14.827
Hi.

12:16.007 --> 12:19.392
Um, w-would you like to
help me make some brownies?

12:20.132 --> 12:21.464
Want to play Go Fish?

12:22.158 --> 12:23.490

12:23.515 --> 12:25.553
Finger paints? Coloring book?

12:25.578 --> 12:28.412
Stickers? Trucks? Dress-up!

12:28.497 --> 12:31.059
Would you like to
watch Ernest go to camp?

12:31.084 --> 12:33.264
I have it on VHS.

12:33.289 --> 12:36.444
I know, because it's been
stuck in there for years.

12:36.483 --> 12:39.201
Okay. See you later.

12:45.261 --> 12:46.927
What's going on?

12:46.975 --> 12:48.265
Are you trying to remember how

12:48.300 --> 12:49.967
to get back to the other room?

12:50.052 --> 12:54.721
No. I-I'm trying to lure Lucas
out from under the dining table.

12:54.807 --> 12:56.139
With my candy?

12:56.164 --> 12:58.025
I didn't dress up like Jack Sparrow

12:58.110 --> 13:00.500
at Halloween just to have you waste it.

13:00.695 --> 13:02.922
Honey, Colleen says he's shy,

13:02.947 --> 13:05.233
but I-I think it's something different.

13:05.258 --> 13:08.402
That's fine, but if I find
an Almond Joy on the floor,

13:08.427 --> 13:10.059
I'm gonna go off.

13:17.473 --> 13:19.046
Hi, Lucas.

13:19.131 --> 13:21.633
I'm so happy to see you.

13:21.954 --> 13:24.718
Would you like some
brownies fresh from the oven?

13:25.037 --> 13:26.904
No, I want to go home!

13:27.735 --> 13:29.651
Hey, what's going on?

13:29.766 --> 13:31.592
Um, could I have a word?

13:31.677 --> 13:33.427
Yeah. Come on, Lucas,

13:33.452 --> 13:35.095
let's read that book of yours again.

13:35.180 --> 13:37.481
See if it ends
differently this time, huh?

13:37.516 --> 13:39.182
Not. (CHUCKLES)

13:39.268 --> 13:41.435
(CHUCKLES)

13:41.520 --> 13:42.853
Is everything okay?

13:42.938 --> 13:45.105
Lucas is terrified of me.

13:45.190 --> 13:47.190
No, Joan, I told you, he's just shy.

13:47.276 --> 13:49.943
Plenty of kids are shy. I was a shy kid.

13:49.968 --> 13:52.029
I-I don't think it's just shyness.

13:52.114 --> 13:54.197
I feel it's something deeper.

13:54.606 --> 13:57.832
No, that's just my
therapeutic two cents.

13:57.857 --> 13:58.872
Well, you know what I think, Joan?

13:58.896 --> 14:00.707
I think if you stop
trying to impress him

14:00.732 --> 14:03.035
with all your yummy
treats and your fun stuff,

14:03.060 --> 14:05.020
that maybe he would
actually start to like you.

14:05.044 --> 14:07.132
See that? So you're not the only one

14:07.157 --> 14:10.247
who understands brain science.

14:12.968 --> 14:14.419
Oh, my.

14:17.271 --> 14:20.107
Lucas, you're just shy
around Mom-Mom, right?

14:20.192 --> 14:23.443
It's not, like, some
deep-seated psychological issue?

14:23.840 --> 14:26.363
- No.
- Exactly. You know.

14:26.398 --> 14:29.866
Well, I'm sorry that she is so pushy.

14:29.902 --> 14:33.070
I didn't let her be pushy
when we got close to the oven.

14:33.215 --> 14:34.348
What?

14:34.373 --> 14:36.239
She's the witch!

14:36.325 --> 14:39.296
Well, I mean, we all
have our opinions of her.

14:39.321 --> 14:42.245
No. She's the witch
who puts out the candy

14:42.381 --> 14:44.293
and tries to cook Hansel and Gretel.

14:44.318 --> 14:45.666
- Look.
- (GASPS)

14:45.751 --> 14:47.634
Oh, no.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.803
Wow, that looks exactly like her.

14:50.364 --> 14:52.138
I have to send this to Jen.

14:53.968 --> 14:56.426
Hi-ee. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

14:56.976 --> 14:59.012
So, I was just talking to Lucas, and...

14:59.098 --> 15:02.051
(CHUCKLES) Oh, my gosh, it's so funny.

15:02.076 --> 15:03.659
You're gonna laugh.

15:03.883 --> 15:06.184
Uh, but it, it was
something deeper, Joan.

15:06.209 --> 15:08.498
You were right. But
it's also super funny.

15:08.523 --> 15:10.073
- Oh, I'm glad it's funny.
- (CHUCKLES)

15:10.109 --> 15:12.654
Oh, I'm relieved. Okay,
I can take that. Tell me.

15:12.679 --> 15:15.232
Okay. All right. Well,
um, you know the book

15:15.257 --> 15:17.195
that Lucas was trying to
get everyone to read him?

15:17.219 --> 15:20.499
No, dear, because he's put me
on a grandma restraining order.

15:20.524 --> 15:23.180
Right. Okay, well,
it's Hansel and Gretel.

15:23.205 --> 15:24.979
And in it, there's a witch

15:25.004 --> 15:27.421
that looks exactly like you.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.186
- Like me?
- Uh-huh.

15:29.211 --> 15:31.178
- (CHUCKLES):
- Oh, no, I don't think so.

15:31.263 --> 15:33.096
Isn't that crazy? It's
literally your twin.

15:33.132 --> 15:34.715
That could be your passport photo.

15:34.800 --> 15:37.551
(CHUCKLES) I don't
look anything like that.

18:45.689 --> 18:47.392
but there's no pressure for you.

18:48.953 --> 18:50.751
(GAGS)

18:54.108 --> 18:55.774
(GROANS)

18:59.972 --> 19:02.450
Hey, I'm sorry. I feel like
I kind of ruined this night.

19:02.474 --> 19:05.994
Oh, no, man, it was...
it was good. We had fun.

19:06.019 --> 19:07.310
Yeah.

19:08.269 --> 19:09.978
Remember when I drank that margarita?

19:10.003 --> 19:12.315
(CHUCKLES): Yeah.
That-that just happened.

19:12.340 --> 19:13.338
Yeah.

19:13.363 --> 19:15.127
Remember I tried to
pull your pants down?

19:15.152 --> 19:16.901
Yeah. That just happened, too.

19:16.926 --> 19:18.807
Ah, it was probably a stupid idea

19:18.832 --> 19:20.315
for me to try to even have a party.

19:20.340 --> 19:21.741
Oh, no, no, no. It was good.

19:21.766 --> 19:23.496
- It was good.
- Yeah?

19:23.521 --> 19:24.689
Yeah. So you'll stay?

19:24.714 --> 19:27.114
'Cause the churro guy's gonna
be here in, like, half an hour.

19:27.456 --> 19:29.798
Uh... (STAMMERS) I
think I'm gonna call it.

19:29.823 --> 19:31.159
Yeah, cool. Cool.

19:31.781 --> 19:32.696
All right.

19:32.721 --> 19:33.924
Hey, um...

19:36.120 --> 19:38.150
So you'll always remember tonight.

19:38.175 --> 19:39.542
Hey, all right.

19:41.246 --> 19:43.041
Hey, baby, it's me.

19:43.066 --> 19:44.635
I'm coming home a little bit early.

19:44.660 --> 19:48.151
Uh, Tim threw this big guys'
night party for the two of us.

19:48.176 --> 19:50.322
I mean, I know that he loves me, but...

19:50.347 --> 19:52.227
(CHUCKLES) I mean, there-there was food

19:52.252 --> 19:54.712
and booze for, like, ten people...

20:02.332 --> 20:03.678
Hey, man. Did you forget something?

20:03.702 --> 20:06.262
Yeah, man, I realized I
couldn't leave without having one

20:06.287 --> 20:08.705
of those margaritas in
its natural frozen state.

20:08.730 --> 20:10.931
Oh, cool! Well, I had to unplug it,

20:10.956 --> 20:12.971
so it's gonna be another four hours.

20:13.534 --> 20:15.024
You invited a bunch of
guys over for a guys' night,

20:15.048 --> 20:16.681
and I'm the only one who showed up, huh?

20:16.706 --> 20:18.063
No, I didn't.

20:19.376 --> 20:21.218
Yeah. What gave me away?

20:21.258 --> 20:23.327
You got three valets outside.

20:23.352 --> 20:25.054
- Damn it, they're still here?
- Yeah.

20:25.079 --> 20:28.322
Hey! I told you guys to go!

20:30.244 --> 20:33.330
Everyone bailed on me to go over
to Dr. Oh's to watch the fight.

20:33.355 --> 20:36.119
Joke's on them, it
only lasted 15 seconds.

20:36.389 --> 20:38.022
Wait, you didn't invite Greg?

20:38.174 --> 20:40.056
No, 'cause then I
figured you wouldn't come.

20:42.244 --> 20:43.993
You want to take a
picture, make him jealous?

20:44.017 --> 20:45.540
- Yeah, let's take our pants off.
- (CHUCKLES)

20:45.564 --> 20:47.139
- No, I don't think so.
- All right.

20:47.164 --> 20:48.842
I'll take mine off and you kiss me.

20:48.867 --> 20:50.280
