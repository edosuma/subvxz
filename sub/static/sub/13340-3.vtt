00:04.134 --> 00:06.049
- Previously on
"Good Girls"...

00:06.093 --> 00:07.224
- That's your homie, right?

00:07.268 --> 00:08.617
He's talking to the Feds now.

00:08.660 --> 00:09.792
So, I'm gonna need you
to handle that.

00:09.835 --> 00:11.620
- All right.
Let me see it.

00:13.448 --> 00:15.667
- Am I the only one
who doesn't wanna do this?

00:15.711 --> 00:16.799
- No.

00:16.842 --> 00:18.366
- He's a rapist.

00:18.409 --> 00:20.194
- No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

00:20.237 --> 00:21.369
Hang on.

00:21.412 --> 00:22.805
- Don't let him talk.
Just do it.

00:22.848 --> 00:24.328
- You are not going to give
that deposition.

00:24.372 --> 00:25.590
- Because she's gonna kill you.

00:25.634 --> 00:27.070
- How much?

00:27.114 --> 00:28.811
Come on, everyone's
got a number.

00:28.854 --> 00:30.595
But you gotta disappear
for good.

00:33.642 --> 00:35.774
- Well, that's twice now.

00:35.818 --> 00:37.298
- They got to me.

00:37.341 --> 00:39.387
There were, like,
three or four of them.

00:39.430 --> 00:41.215
I mean--
- It won't happen again.

00:41.258 --> 00:44.218
If I have to take you to
the courthouse myself, I will.

00:45.306 --> 00:48.178
- I am just so tired.

00:48.222 --> 00:49.353
I can't kill somebody.

00:49.397 --> 00:51.051
- I'm gonna teach you.

01:19.166 --> 01:20.776
- I booked a hotel room.

01:22.212 --> 01:24.258
For the alibi or whatever.

01:27.174 --> 01:29.176
- Girls' night.

01:29.219 --> 01:31.439
- We'll just put her
in the bathtub.

01:32.440 --> 01:34.268
- Yeah.

01:34.311 --> 01:37.445
With a fat glass of wine,
she loves that.

01:37.488 --> 01:41.144
- I got Tylenol PM for after.

01:41.188 --> 01:43.538
Just in case she can't--
- That's good.

01:45.453 --> 01:47.498
She's gonna be fine.

01:56.246 --> 01:58.161
We're all gonna be fine.

02:02.731 --> 02:03.862
Here we go.

02:08.824 --> 02:10.304
That's not him.

02:10.347 --> 02:11.609
- You said he takes
the trash out--

02:11.653 --> 02:12.741
- He does! He always does.

02:19.791 --> 02:21.793
Hang on, hang on.
Oh, my God.

02:21.837 --> 02:23.186
- Call her.
- Okay, I'm calling her.

02:23.230 --> 02:24.318
I'm calling her.
I'm calling her.

02:32.674 --> 02:34.458
She's not answering.
It must be on silent.

02:43.772 --> 02:45.643
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

02:53.347 --> 02:54.435
- Tyler!

02:55.566 --> 02:56.654
- Annie?

03:12.757 --> 03:15.847
- Hey, Annie.
- Hey yo.

03:15.891 --> 03:17.893
- Hi.
What--what are you doing?

03:17.936 --> 03:19.590
You don't close ever.

03:19.634 --> 03:21.984
- Oh, well, now that I'm
the acting manager, I do.

03:22.027 --> 03:23.681
- What about Boomer?

03:23.725 --> 03:26.293
- Oh, he never showed up
for his shift the other day,

03:26.336 --> 03:28.512
so I sort of stepped in.

03:28.556 --> 03:30.558
Hey, did you change your hair?

03:33.735 --> 03:35.693
- The Feds got him tucked away.

03:43.527 --> 03:44.746
- What does that mean?

03:45.964 --> 03:49.272
- Probably protective custody
or whatnot.

03:49.316 --> 03:50.795
Someone got a whiff
of something.

03:50.839 --> 03:53.233
- How do you even know that?

03:53.276 --> 03:54.930
- Home court advantage.

03:55.931 --> 03:57.715
What's up, bud?

03:57.759 --> 03:59.543
- I wanna go on
the monkey bars.

03:59.587 --> 04:00.762
- You wanna go on
the monkey bars?

04:00.805 --> 04:02.894
It looks like someone's
on it though.

04:02.938 --> 04:04.331
- But I wanna--

04:04.374 --> 04:06.594
- No, I know what
you wanna do, okay?

04:06.637 --> 04:08.596
But when that kid's done,
you'll get your turn.

04:08.639 --> 04:10.511
Okay?
All right, come on.

04:10.554 --> 04:12.600
We all gotta tough it out
sometimes.

04:12.643 --> 04:14.428
Have fun.

04:14.471 --> 04:17.518
Playground don't get easier,
right?

04:17.561 --> 04:19.520
Might as well learn now.

04:22.653 --> 04:24.655
- So, you'll take it
from here then?

04:24.699 --> 04:26.527
- Excuse me?

04:28.006 --> 04:29.617
- I mean, if he's in custody

04:29.660 --> 04:31.314
and we can't get to him,
it's over.

04:31.358 --> 04:33.795
- No.
It's over when you finish it.

04:34.622 --> 04:36.363
- How?

04:36.406 --> 04:38.495
- Be a boss bitch.

04:41.542 --> 04:42.673
- How?

04:43.631 --> 04:46.068
- I don't know.
Root him out.

04:46.111 --> 04:47.852
He on Facebook?

05:01.649 --> 05:03.868
- That's way too many
bathroom selfies.

05:08.960 --> 05:09.961
- You know Diandra?

05:10.005 --> 05:11.920
- Diandra.
No.

05:11.963 --> 05:13.748
- You know, Diandra-Diandra.

05:13.791 --> 05:16.403
She gave me the fireworks
on my nails for the Fourth,

05:16.446 --> 05:17.708
turkeys for Thanksgiving.

05:17.752 --> 05:18.970
- Yep, yep, yep.

05:19.014 --> 05:20.624
- Her crazy ass boyfriend
is gone.

05:20.668 --> 05:22.626
- What do you mean "gone?"

05:22.670 --> 05:24.715
- Just up and disappeared
a few days ago.

05:24.759 --> 05:27.327
- He ran out on her?

05:27.370 --> 05:29.372
- I mean, she doesn't know.

05:29.416 --> 05:31.679
- Just ghosted, huh?

05:31.722 --> 05:34.072
- Poor girl is losing her mind
trying to find him.

05:34.116 --> 05:35.987
- Ah, well, tell her
to call me.

05:36.901 --> 05:38.990
- Nah, she's too embarrassed.

05:39.034 --> 05:41.036
- She's gonna need to file
a missing person's.

05:44.692 --> 05:49.044
- So, what kinda stuff
would y'all do to root him out?

05:49.087 --> 05:51.394
- Um...

05:51.438 --> 05:55.137
Track the cell,
try family.

05:55.180 --> 05:57.052
You know, he's been talking to
somebody,

05:57.095 --> 05:58.749
you just gotta knock on
the right doors.

05:59.881 --> 06:01.361
- Yeah, right.

06:01.404 --> 06:03.101
- I need the internet
for my report.

06:04.407 --> 06:06.714
- Okay, I'm gonna need you
to check all of that.

06:08.890 --> 06:10.544
- Please?

06:11.675 --> 06:13.155
- What's it on?

06:13.198 --> 06:14.678
- Where our garbage goes.

06:14.722 --> 06:16.811
- Ew.
All right. I'll get off.

06:20.075 --> 06:21.685
- Suspect.

06:31.086 --> 06:32.435
- No way.

06:32.479 --> 06:33.436
Get out of town.

06:33.480 --> 06:36.091
You go here?

06:36.134 --> 06:38.615
- I get my hair done
every Friday.

06:38.659 --> 06:40.530
- You're kidding me.

06:40.574 --> 06:41.792
That is so crazy.

06:41.836 --> 06:43.751
- What a small world.
- Yeah.

06:43.794 --> 06:45.535
It really is.

06:45.579 --> 06:47.624
While I have you, um,

06:47.668 --> 06:51.715
is everything okay with Leslie?

06:51.759 --> 06:53.021
- Oh, why wouldn't it be?

06:53.064 --> 06:55.676
- Well, he just hasn't
showed up for work

06:55.719 --> 06:57.765
in a few days, so you know.

06:57.808 --> 07:00.202
- He hasn't mentioned
being sick.

07:00.245 --> 07:02.596
- Oh, good, but you have
talked to him then?

07:02.639 --> 07:05.425
- Every single night
before bed.

07:06.861 --> 07:09.733
You tell me any grandson
who would do that.

07:09.777 --> 07:12.083
- There are not too many.

07:12.127 --> 07:15.173
- Yeah, the rest of the bunch,
I could take or leave.

07:15.217 --> 07:17.872
But Leslie's a true gentleman.

07:17.915 --> 07:20.918
- Hmm.
He is definitely something.

07:20.962 --> 07:24.574
- It's rare to find a boy
his age so thoughtful.

07:24.618 --> 07:27.664
- Yeah. You don't know
where he is, do ya?

07:27.708 --> 07:30.101
- Well, probably
with his fiancÃ©e.

07:30.145 --> 07:33.453
He is so sweet with her.

07:42.505 --> 07:44.725
- They're all related?

07:44.768 --> 07:45.856
I'm out.

08:02.743 --> 08:03.787
Hi, Beetle.

08:03.831 --> 08:04.919
- Where are you?

08:04.962 --> 08:07.835
- Mmm.
I can't say.

08:07.878 --> 08:09.532
- Why not?

08:09.576 --> 08:11.969
- Well, I'm kind of on
a special assignment.

08:12.013 --> 08:13.623
- What the hell, Leslie?

08:13.667 --> 08:18.149
- Look, this is very
high level stuff, okay?

08:18.193 --> 08:19.542
And I might've just
jeopardized your life

08:19.586 --> 08:20.891
by telling you that much.

08:20.935 --> 08:22.240
- Well, you didn't even
leave a note.

08:22.284 --> 08:24.025
- Well, I didn't think
you'd care.

08:24.068 --> 08:26.810
- Yeah, well, I do,
and the kids are worried, so...

08:26.854 --> 08:28.638
- I'm sorry.

08:28.682 --> 08:29.770
- You can't just come and go
out of their lives

08:29.813 --> 08:31.162
like that, you know?

08:31.206 --> 08:33.164
I mean, they don't get it,
so they miss you.

08:33.208 --> 08:34.601
- Seriously?

08:34.644 --> 08:35.863
- Yeah, Benji wanted you
to read him

08:35.906 --> 08:37.560
his bedtime story last night.

08:41.695 --> 08:43.044
- Ah, well...

08:44.306 --> 08:46.569
You tell that little turd
we'll FaceTime.

08:46.613 --> 08:47.962
Okay?

08:48.005 --> 08:50.268
- It's not just him though.
I mean, I...

08:50.312 --> 08:51.879
- What do you mean?

08:55.622 --> 08:57.537
- I mean, I guess
I miss you, too.

08:57.580 --> 08:59.060
So...

08:59.103 --> 09:01.628
Oh, my God.
Mary Pat, just shut up.

09:05.893 --> 09:07.590
- I miss you.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.070
A lot.

09:12.943 --> 09:16.817
Tell you what,
grab a pen and paper.

09:16.860 --> 09:17.992
- Okay.

09:20.734 --> 09:23.824
All right.
Mm-hmm.

09:25.260 --> 09:27.349
I understand.
I promise.

09:27.392 --> 09:29.307
Yeah, I will.

09:29.351 --> 09:32.180
Okay.
I'll see you soon.

09:37.402 --> 09:39.187
He's at the Simple Stay
over on Grand River.

09:39.230 --> 09:40.971
- Ew.
- Oy.

09:41.015 --> 09:43.017
- Gross.

09:43.060 --> 09:44.801
Thank you.

09:49.284 --> 09:50.590
- What are you gonna do?

09:52.896 --> 09:55.116
I mean, when you find him.

09:59.033 --> 10:01.209
- We're gonna make sure
he can't ever bully us again.

10:05.735 --> 10:06.997
- You know what?

10:10.131 --> 10:12.133
I think you should kill him.

10:27.583 --> 10:30.717
- Someone's been smoked here
before for sure.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.327
- Hold up.

10:37.898 --> 10:40.248
- Okay, we've got ten minutes
till he's back.

10:40.291 --> 10:41.336
- All right.

10:44.774 --> 10:46.515
What are you doing?

10:47.734 --> 10:50.084
- I'm gonna do it.
- Give me the gun.

10:50.127 --> 10:52.303
- It should be me.
- Why?

10:52.347 --> 10:54.523
- Well, you've taken a couple
swings now,

10:54.566 --> 10:55.785
champ, and you did great.

10:55.829 --> 10:59.093
But it's time to bring in
the A-Team.

10:59.136 --> 11:00.311
- Just give me the gun.

11:00.355 --> 11:02.444
- Will you jump in here,
please?

11:02.487 --> 11:03.793
- I got brothers, I don't--

11:03.837 --> 11:05.403
- What if there's a witness?

11:05.447 --> 11:07.275
- Come on.

11:07.318 --> 11:08.885
- Anyone--a maid.

11:08.929 --> 11:10.757
- There has never been
a maid here.

11:15.152 --> 11:16.676
- I can't have this on you.

11:16.719 --> 11:21.550
- Hey, I have done
a few things. Okay?

11:21.593 --> 11:23.726
- I'm the one who got us here,
I did this.

11:23.770 --> 11:27.164
- Hey, he did this.

11:28.818 --> 11:31.691
Son of a bitch
tried to rape me.

11:36.347 --> 11:38.132
- You keep your head down.

11:38.175 --> 11:39.568
- Okay.
Knock and shoot.

11:39.611 --> 11:40.656
- And don't forget to drop
the gun--

11:40.700 --> 11:42.745
- I got it.

11:42.789 --> 11:44.355
I got it.

12:00.415 --> 12:02.591
- It doesn't matter.

12:02.634 --> 12:04.462
It's on all of us.

12:04.506 --> 12:08.640
- âª The city of stone

12:10.817 --> 12:14.255
âª It's so cold and lonely

12:14.298 --> 12:18.650
âª No love of my own

12:18.694 --> 12:23.220
âª I can just only

12:23.264 --> 12:27.659
âª Cry in the night

12:27.703 --> 12:30.358
âª 'Cause nothing goes right

12:30.401 --> 12:34.231
âª When you're alone

12:34.275 --> 12:37.365
âª So I'm alone

12:37.408 --> 12:40.803
âª In the city of stone

12:45.634 --> 12:47.810
âª No one to talk to

12:47.854 --> 12:49.507
- What are you doing here?

12:49.551 --> 12:50.857
- I should ask you
the same thing.

12:50.900 --> 12:53.381
- âª No one to care

12:53.424 --> 12:56.340
âª Strangers won't listen

12:58.734 --> 13:00.344
- I was on my way, but--

13:00.388 --> 13:02.390
- Oh, I've heard that before.

13:02.433 --> 13:05.654
My sitter fell through
and then the kids were--

13:05.697 --> 13:07.699
so, I was gonna call.

13:08.962 --> 13:10.833
- I thought you missed me.

13:10.877 --> 13:12.835
Hmm?

13:12.879 --> 13:16.012
- You know, I really don't
like it when you drink though.

13:16.056 --> 13:19.755
- âª Alone in the city
of stone âª

13:21.931 --> 13:24.716
âª Yeah I got nobody
to talk to âª

13:24.760 --> 13:27.894
âª In the city of stone

13:27.937 --> 13:29.765
- Where are you going?

13:38.643 --> 13:41.298
- Will you stop?
The boys are sleeping.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.706
- We booked the reception hall.

13:59.403 --> 14:01.318
- I think you should go.

14:01.362 --> 14:03.494
- We made the guest list.

14:03.538 --> 14:06.323
We spoke to the pastor.
You picked the cake.

14:06.367 --> 14:07.803
- Oh my God, you are so drunk.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.718
- Nana is so pumped.

14:09.761 --> 14:11.676
She has been waiting
her whole life for this.

14:11.720 --> 14:12.982
- Lower your voice.

14:13.026 --> 14:15.811
- We are getting married.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.508
- No, we're not.

14:18.379 --> 14:19.859
- Why would you say that?

14:22.774 --> 14:24.820
- I don't love you.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.909
- Why would you say that?

14:26.953 --> 14:28.737
- You're a terrible person.

14:28.780 --> 14:31.609
- Well don't say that.
- You are.

14:31.653 --> 14:33.002
I hate you.

14:34.438 --> 14:35.787
- I do.
- Stop it.

14:35.831 --> 14:37.572
- God, I hate you.
I hate you so much.

14:37.615 --> 14:38.790
- I said shut up.

14:40.444 --> 14:43.012
When you say things like that,
see, that's what gets me mad.

14:43.056 --> 14:44.405
Okay?

14:47.408 --> 14:48.800
- I want you to leave.

15:07.080 --> 15:09.038
- I'm gonna make you so happy.

15:22.834 --> 15:24.706
- Where is this guy?

15:25.925 --> 15:27.056
- Probably at a strip club.

15:27.100 --> 15:28.884
- What if he brings one back?

15:28.928 --> 15:30.407
- Please.

15:30.451 --> 15:31.626
They're professionals,
they're not just gonna

15:31.669 --> 15:32.932
go home with anybody.

15:34.846 --> 15:36.631
- 'Cause there's
a code of conduct?

15:40.200 --> 15:42.463
- Something bit me.

15:42.506 --> 15:44.900
This place is nasty.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.989
- What do you think a room
like this goes for?

15:47.033 --> 15:48.773
- 29.99.

15:48.817 --> 15:50.732
- Come on, Beth.
No way.

15:52.168 --> 15:54.083
- It's disgusting.

15:54.127 --> 15:57.478
- Yeah, but you got, like,
you know, Greektown,

15:57.521 --> 15:59.741
and the Renaissance Center,
and--

15:59.784 --> 16:01.786
- Comerica Park, Ford Field.

16:01.830 --> 16:03.875
- It's no more than 40.

16:05.442 --> 16:06.617
- Look it up.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.446
- You look it up.

16:09.490 --> 16:12.623
- You look it up,
I'm holding a gun.

16:15.670 --> 16:18.064
- Like we need to know.

16:21.197 --> 16:23.112
It's 150.

16:25.593 --> 16:26.942
- A night?

16:26.986 --> 16:28.465
- Told you.

16:50.879 --> 16:54.622
- âª B-I-L-L-I-E

16:54.665 --> 16:57.625
âª H-O-L-I-D-A-Y

16:57.668 --> 16:58.974
- Mommy?

16:59.018 --> 17:01.063
Mom?

17:01.107 --> 17:02.934
Mommy?

17:02.978 --> 17:04.849
Mom?

17:04.893 --> 17:07.069
Mommy, I called
but you didn't come.

17:07.113 --> 17:08.114
- Hi--shh.
Come here.

17:08.157 --> 17:10.638
It's okay.
I'm sorry.

17:10.681 --> 17:11.987
What's up?

17:12.031 --> 17:13.249
- I'm hungry.

17:13.293 --> 17:15.686
- You are?
Okay.

17:15.730 --> 17:18.167
Do you wanna go get
some pancakes?

17:18.211 --> 17:20.648
Do you know where Mommy
keeps her purse?

17:20.691 --> 17:21.997
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

17:22.041 --> 17:25.087
So, you're gonna go get
my keys, okay?

17:25.131 --> 17:27.655
And I'm gonna get
your brothers, all right?

17:27.698 --> 17:31.833
But here's the thing, we need
to be super, super quiet.

17:31.876 --> 17:33.791
Okay?

17:33.835 --> 17:35.097
- What about him?

17:36.316 --> 17:38.057
You know what?

17:38.100 --> 17:40.276
I think we should just let him
sleep a little bit.

17:40.320 --> 17:43.018
Okay?
Okay.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.151
Okay, but you gotta
be quiet.

17:45.194 --> 17:49.807
âª Tear me away
from my guy âª

17:52.680 --> 17:54.247
âª Nothing you can do

17:54.290 --> 17:58.686
âª 'Cause I'm stuck like glue
to my guy âª

18:00.905 --> 18:02.733
- I know, bubba.

18:02.777 --> 18:03.995
I know, we're gonna get
that diaper changed

18:04.039 --> 18:05.519
as soon as we can, okay?

18:05.562 --> 18:06.607
Just give me just a second,
all right?

18:06.650 --> 18:09.131
I promise.
I promise.

18:09.175 --> 18:11.002
Okay.

18:15.050 --> 18:16.225
Okay.

18:19.141 --> 18:20.229
Okay.

18:25.191 --> 18:26.670
- What are you doing?

18:35.897 --> 18:37.725
- Hey.

18:37.768 --> 18:39.727
Hey, what the hell?

18:39.770 --> 18:42.077
Hey, open the damn door.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.210
Hey.
Open up.

18:44.253 --> 18:46.037
Where do you think
you're going, huh?

18:48.127 --> 18:49.824
Stupid bitch.
Open the damn door.

18:49.867 --> 18:51.173
Let's go.

18:51.217 --> 18:52.957
Where do you think
you're going, huh?

19:01.140 --> 19:04.012
- âª We'll live forever

19:04.055 --> 19:06.884
âª Knowing together

19:06.928 --> 19:10.105
âª That we did it all

19:10.149 --> 19:13.064
âª For the glory of love

19:19.332 --> 19:20.942
- It was an accident.

19:20.985 --> 19:22.248
- We gotta call the cops.

19:22.291 --> 19:23.597
- Uh, she's gotta call
the cops.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.425
We gotta go.

19:25.468 --> 19:27.601
- Just tell them it was
an accident.

19:27.644 --> 19:29.168
- It was.

19:29.211 --> 19:30.952
- Yeah, I mean he--he ran
behind the car.

19:30.995 --> 19:32.519
- He was kinda asking for it.

19:32.562 --> 19:34.042
- Yeah.

19:37.480 --> 19:39.743
I mean, except, um...

19:41.615 --> 19:43.530
Well, then I moved the body.

19:45.749 --> 19:47.403
- Okay.

19:47.447 --> 19:49.666
- I mean, I didn't want
the kids to see it, so...

19:51.190 --> 19:52.974
- I mean, nobody's gonna
argue with that.

19:53.017 --> 19:54.454
Right?
- Mm-mmm.

19:54.497 --> 19:59.415
Where did you, um, put it?

19:59.459 --> 20:01.243
- I didn't want it to smell...

20:01.287 --> 20:03.158
- Okay.

20:03.202 --> 20:06.292
I mean, it's supposed to be
so hot today, so...

20:06.335 --> 20:09.338
- A real scorcher.
- Yeah.

20:09.382 --> 20:13.386
And Jeff used to hunt,
so we have, um,

20:13.429 --> 20:15.692
we have a meat freezer.

20:18.739 --> 20:21.481
- Well, that still makes sense.

20:24.353 --> 20:28.488
- Yeah, except he just got
so bloated.

20:33.754 --> 20:36.539
I think that's because,
you know,

20:36.583 --> 20:39.586
all the gases that
get trapped inside?

20:43.633 --> 20:48.421
So, then he--then he
wouldn't fit.

20:52.555 --> 20:54.253
- What do you mean?

20:56.124 --> 20:58.735
- I mean there was just
like,

20:58.779 --> 21:01.085
like, too much of him to...

21:05.786 --> 21:08.571
You know, at first.

21:08.615 --> 21:11.357
- Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

21:11.400 --> 21:14.664
- You know those, um,
those electric knives

21:14.708 --> 21:17.537
like you use at like,
at Thanksgiving?

21:21.541 --> 21:24.370
- Mommy?
We're hungry.

21:24.413 --> 21:26.415
- Okay, who wants waffles?

21:37.687 --> 21:39.820
- That's a meat locker, huh?

21:39.863 --> 21:42.257
- Dude, we should just leave.

21:42.301 --> 21:43.737
- Don't hold much meat.

21:43.780 --> 21:45.391
- What are you talking about?

21:45.434 --> 21:47.262
- We should go, and the cops
will do their job.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.525
And she'll take the fall,
and we'll be totally clean.

21:49.569 --> 21:52.441
- What are you even
talking about?

21:52.485 --> 21:55.401
- She murdered him, Beth.

21:55.444 --> 21:57.838
- We were about to do
the same thing.

21:57.881 --> 21:59.709
- Yeah, but we didn't,
and we sure as hell

21:59.753 --> 22:01.450
weren't gonna chop him up.

22:01.494 --> 22:04.845
- Small game maybe.
Like, real small.

22:04.888 --> 22:07.413
- Listen, we were the first
call she made.

22:07.456 --> 22:09.589
If she's going down,
we are going down.

22:09.632 --> 22:11.286
- Like a pheasant.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.288
- Do you understand that
she is like

22:13.332 --> 22:15.246
a literal mental patient,
right?

22:15.290 --> 22:16.900
- We made her call him.

22:16.944 --> 22:19.163
- Or a grouse.

22:19.207 --> 22:21.470
- Okay, so, what are we
supposed to do with this then?

22:23.472 --> 22:24.560
Anyone?

22:24.604 --> 22:26.214
- I don't know.

22:26.257 --> 22:28.172
We get rid of it.

22:28.216 --> 22:29.652
- Where?

22:32.176 --> 22:34.570
Well, we wait until it's dark
and then...

22:36.485 --> 22:38.487
And then we'll figure it out.

22:53.372 --> 22:56.331
- Be easier to carry
if he's all thawed out.

23:01.510 --> 23:03.251
- Oh, my God.
I am so sorry.

23:03.294 --> 23:06.210
It's just been kind
of a mess of a day.

23:06.254 --> 23:07.647
What did I miss?

23:07.690 --> 23:10.650
- They caught Kenny
in the teachers' lounge.

23:12.478 --> 23:13.827
- Okay.

23:13.870 --> 23:15.568
Not the biggest crime
in the world, so--

23:15.611 --> 23:18.658
- He--he ate somebody's
retirement cake.

23:18.701 --> 23:22.531
- So, we're here because
Kenny had a slice of cake?

23:22.575 --> 23:24.707
- He ate more than a slice.

23:25.752 --> 23:28.189
- He ate the entire cake.

23:28.232 --> 23:30.234
- Well, how many people
was it for?

23:31.801 --> 23:32.889
- Everyone who works here.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.502
Mm-hmm.

23:36.545 --> 23:39.809
Look, in my experience,
behavior like this

23:39.853 --> 23:41.768
is often a cry for help.

23:44.466 --> 23:48.557
Is there anything unusual
going on at home?

23:57.523 --> 23:58.915
- We need to be more present,

23:58.959 --> 24:00.264
put the phone down
once in a while.

24:00.308 --> 24:01.527
- It's not about the phone.

24:01.570 --> 24:03.224
- I heard a thing on NPR
that said phone--

24:03.267 --> 24:04.921
- Maybe it has something
to do with the fact that

24:04.965 --> 24:07.010
some psycho gang banger
shot his dad,

24:07.054 --> 24:08.708
and now his shady ass mom's
running around

24:08.751 --> 24:10.492
doing God knows what.

24:10.536 --> 24:12.451
I mean, where--where were you
last night?

24:13.930 --> 24:15.410
- Book club.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.368
- Book club.
All night long?

24:17.412 --> 24:18.761
- Can we be at a point now

24:18.805 --> 24:20.937
where we just know what
"book club" means?

24:20.981 --> 24:22.852
- You're about to put bleach
in with the colors.

24:22.896 --> 24:23.984
- You wanna do laundry?

24:26.334 --> 24:28.554
We will find someone who deals
with this kinda thing.

24:28.597 --> 24:30.469
- We can't afford a shrink.

24:33.646 --> 24:35.561
Okay, fine.

24:35.604 --> 24:37.476
No phones at dinner.

24:58.497 --> 25:01.412
- The landfills import enough
solid waste each year

25:01.456 --> 25:04.720
to fill over one million
garbage trucks.

25:04.764 --> 25:06.287
- Hey.
- If you lined those trucks up,

25:06.330 --> 25:07.941
they'd stretch from
New York City

25:07.984 --> 25:10.030
to San Francisco
and back again.

25:10.073 --> 25:11.727
- You okay?

25:13.642 --> 25:14.948
- Long day.
- All right.

25:14.991 --> 25:17.341
Well, look alive
or lose a finger.

25:17.385 --> 25:20.693
- Dirty diapers,
plastic bottles, plastic bags,

25:20.736 --> 25:22.999
coffee cups,
rubber-soled shoes,

25:23.043 --> 25:24.784
dead animals...

25:24.827 --> 25:26.525
- What is she doing in there?

25:26.568 --> 25:28.483
- Her working on her report
about landfills.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.311
- It'd take two hours
just to walk

25:30.354 --> 25:32.487
from one side of it
to the other.

25:32.531 --> 25:35.577
That's almost thirty
square miles of trash.

25:37.710 --> 25:40.713
All dumped right here
in Eastern Michigan.

25:40.756 --> 25:42.410
At this rate...

25:43.933 --> 25:45.587
What?

25:45.631 --> 25:46.762
- Where'd you say
this trash was?

25:52.638 --> 25:53.900
- Hey.

25:55.902 --> 25:57.991
- You're kidding me, right?

25:58.034 --> 25:59.601
- How was work?

25:59.645 --> 26:01.472
Sadie's in the car.

26:04.650 --> 26:06.129
- What do you want?

26:06.173 --> 26:07.870
- Is there any way you could
take her for the night?

26:07.914 --> 26:10.525
- So you can bone some other
pregnant lady's husband?

26:10.569 --> 26:13.049
- I have to take
a little road trip.

26:13.093 --> 26:14.834
- Now?

26:14.877 --> 26:18.707
- Yeah, well, a friend
suddenly passed away, so...

26:18.751 --> 26:21.623
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

26:21.667 --> 26:25.584
- You'd be doing it for her,
not me.

26:28.761 --> 26:29.936
- I love her.

26:29.979 --> 26:31.067
- I know.

26:31.111 --> 26:35.028
- I don't love you.

26:35.071 --> 26:36.725
- I know.

26:39.032 --> 26:40.599
- Hey, Sades.

26:41.730 --> 26:43.602
Sleepover.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.631
- Can we turn something on?

27:14.197 --> 27:16.635
- With our thinly-shaved
beef carpaccio.

27:16.678 --> 27:19.725
Then zesty ragu made from
from our fresh ground chop

27:19.768 --> 27:21.552
butchered in house.

27:42.138 --> 27:43.618
- Oh

27:43.662 --> 27:44.619
- Jesus.
- Okay.

27:44.663 --> 27:45.838
Try and lift with your legs.

27:45.881 --> 27:46.839
- You can do it.
- Okay.

28:03.072 --> 28:05.509
- No.
- I don't wanna ask.

28:05.553 --> 28:08.295
So don't.
- We need help.

28:09.122 --> 28:12.342
- We need those
strong sauce arms.

28:14.605 --> 28:17.434
- I would if I could,
but I am telling you I can't.

28:17.478 --> 28:19.219
I can't.
- Ruby, look here.

28:19.262 --> 28:22.222
Look here.
What is tomorrow?

28:22.265 --> 28:24.006
- Trash day.

28:24.050 --> 28:25.616
- So, when do we have
to do this?

28:28.054 --> 28:29.142
Mother--

28:29.185 --> 28:31.318
Forgive me my sins, O Lord.

28:31.361 --> 28:34.582
Forgive me the sins of my youth
and the sins of my age.

28:34.625 --> 28:37.585
- It's okay. It's okay.

28:37.628 --> 28:39.065
We're almost there.

28:39.108 --> 28:40.631
- Forgive me the sins
of my body

28:40.675 --> 28:42.111
and the sins of my soul.

28:42.155 --> 28:43.547
Forgive me the sins

28:43.591 --> 28:46.159
that I have done
to please myself

28:46.202 --> 28:47.682
and to please others.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.553
- Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

28:49.597 --> 28:50.990
Let me get my arm under there.

28:51.033 --> 28:52.600
- Got it.
- Oh, my God.

28:52.643 --> 28:54.515
Oh, sweet Lord.

28:54.558 --> 28:56.256
- What's Harry doing in school?

28:56.299 --> 28:59.128
- He's, uh, dinosaurs.

28:59.172 --> 29:01.087
- Oh.
What's his favorite?

29:01.130 --> 29:02.479
- I'm gonna pass out.

29:02.523 --> 29:04.090
- Hey, hey, come on.
Give me a dinosaur.

29:04.133 --> 29:05.744
Come on.
- I don't know.

29:05.787 --> 29:08.529
- What about a Triceratops?
With--

29:08.572 --> 29:10.444
- Oh, uh, no.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

29:10.487 --> 29:12.576
- Pterodactyl?
- T--T-rex.

29:12.620 --> 29:14.927
T-rex, T-rex.
- Danny likes that one, too.

29:14.970 --> 29:17.190
- Kenny, too, right?
He likes...

29:17.233 --> 29:18.452
- Yeah.

29:18.495 --> 29:20.149
What is it with boys
and T-rex?

29:20.193 --> 29:21.281
- Yeah, they're killers.

29:21.324 --> 29:22.978
-  Oh, my God.

29:24.327 --> 29:25.938
- I didn't mean--I didn't
mean...

29:25.981 --> 29:28.244
I didn't mean that--Oh, God.

29:28.288 --> 29:29.550
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

29:29.593 --> 29:30.681
- We're gonna have to swing
it in.

29:30.725 --> 29:31.726
- Okay.
- Come this way.

29:31.770 --> 29:32.988
- Okay.
- Okay.

29:33.032 --> 29:34.773
- Okay.
- Come on.

29:34.816 --> 29:37.036
Okay.
- Let's do it on three.

29:37.079 --> 29:39.952
- Wait, on three or like,
one, two, three, toss?

29:39.995 --> 29:41.170
- On three.

29:41.214 --> 29:43.738
- So, one, two, three, swing?

29:43.782 --> 29:45.218
- No, see, that's what
I'm saying, that's on four.

29:45.261 --> 29:46.306
Is it on four or is it--

29:46.349 --> 29:48.395
- One, two, swing.

29:48.438 --> 29:50.310
- So, one three.
Final answer.

29:50.353 --> 29:52.094
- Okay.
- Okay.

29:52.138 --> 29:53.356
together: One...

29:53.400 --> 29:54.401
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:54.444 --> 29:57.099
together: Two...three.

30:00.015 --> 30:02.104
- Okay, let's just go.

30:12.288 --> 30:13.768
- Did you check his pockets?

30:15.726 --> 30:18.338
- How would I have checked
his pockets?

30:21.341 --> 30:23.212
It's fine, right?

30:23.256 --> 30:25.780
Let's just go, please.

30:25.824 --> 30:28.696
- We can't just leave it.

30:28.739 --> 30:31.090
- But--
- They'll track it to the body.

30:41.491 --> 30:42.753
Mother--

31:26.754 --> 31:28.451
- Hey, will you stop it?

31:28.495 --> 31:31.454
Boys, will you cut it out?
Hey.

31:33.761 --> 31:35.894
Will you--you know,
someone's going to arrest you

31:35.937 --> 31:37.504
if you keep doing that.

31:37.547 --> 31:39.245
You're not supposed to be--
- Boys, boys.

31:39.288 --> 31:41.247
Or I cold rustle up
a public disobedience charge

31:41.290 --> 31:42.335
if that'll help.

31:42.378 --> 31:44.076
Hi, sorry, I don't...

31:44.119 --> 31:45.773
I didn't wanna bother you,
I just didn't--I didn't--

31:45.816 --> 31:46.905
boys, will you sit down, okay?

31:46.948 --> 31:48.341
Go sit down.

31:48.384 --> 31:49.603
I just I didn't--I didn't know

31:49.646 --> 31:51.431
who else I could talk to, so...

31:51.474 --> 31:52.780
- What's going on?

31:52.823 --> 31:54.695
- I'm--I'm worried
about Leslie.

31:54.738 --> 31:56.349
- Why's that?

31:57.828 --> 32:00.222
- I think something
bad happened.

32:00.266 --> 32:01.789
- Let's talk in my office.

32:01.832 --> 32:02.833
- Okay, boys, follow
the nice man

32:02.877 --> 32:04.487
into his office, okay?

32:04.531 --> 32:06.272
And don't touch anything
while you're in there.

32:06.315 --> 32:08.535
Take--yes.
Take the--thank you.

32:15.890 --> 32:18.327
- Well, this should keep 'em
busy for a while.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.854
- Let's just get it over with.

32:28.511 --> 32:30.122
Who keeps calling this dude?

32:30.165 --> 32:32.472
- It's Marion.

32:32.515 --> 32:34.604
She's called him, like,
seven times.

32:36.650 --> 32:39.305
- Don't.
Annie.

32:42.743 --> 32:44.266
Don't.

32:46.965 --> 32:49.228
- What time you coming
tonight, honey?

32:49.271 --> 32:52.535
I need to know when
to put the roast in the oven.

32:55.886 --> 32:59.325
Oh, you're really gonna
tease me.

32:59.368 --> 33:02.502
I mean, guess what I forgot
to pick up?

33:02.545 --> 33:04.460
The roast.

33:10.379 --> 33:11.902
Don't worry about dinner,

33:11.946 --> 33:15.341
you're probably out
having a good time.

33:15.384 --> 33:16.820
I hope you're wearing

33:16.864 --> 33:19.214
some of that nice cologne
we bought.

33:19.258 --> 33:21.695
- Stop.

33:21.738 --> 33:24.828
- Well, I'm turning in.

33:24.872 --> 33:28.528
I'm sure I'll hear
from you tomorrow.

33:28.571 --> 33:31.748
You be a good boy.

33:31.792 --> 33:34.621
If you would just give me
a quick ring when you get in,

33:34.664 --> 33:37.189
even if it's late.

33:37.232 --> 33:40.975
It's the funniest thing,
I just can't get to sleep.

34:29.415 --> 34:32.200
- âª It's too easy

34:36.944 --> 34:41.035
âª To give in these days

34:48.086 --> 34:52.220
âª It's too easy

34:56.920 --> 35:01.099
âª To blend into the grey

35:08.062 --> 35:13.198
âª When I build these walls

35:13.241 --> 35:18.420
âª I build them so high
I build them so high âª

35:29.301 --> 35:31.172
âª It's too easy

35:31.216 --> 35:34.175
- I'm sorry I ate the cake.

35:37.439 --> 35:40.486
- âª To walk away

35:40.529 --> 35:42.966
- It's not your fault.

35:51.845 --> 35:56.893
- âª So you could leave me

35:59.418 --> 36:00.897
- Hey.

36:03.248 --> 36:05.293
How late did you work?

36:08.078 --> 36:09.993
- I did something really bad.

36:14.563 --> 36:15.869
- Hey.

36:16.870 --> 36:18.219
What'd you do?

36:25.966 --> 36:28.229
I took a payday loan.

36:30.318 --> 36:33.539
I used your check as collateral
and forged your name.

36:39.240 --> 36:40.546
- Why?

36:40.589 --> 36:42.852
- Insurance was taking forever,
I had bills.

36:42.896 --> 36:44.158
I don't know,
I just walked in--

36:44.202 --> 36:46.073
- All right, all right.

36:46.116 --> 36:47.944
It's okay.
It's no biggie.

36:49.250 --> 36:50.556
We'll figure it out.

37:01.306 --> 37:03.656
- Morning.
- Morning.

37:07.573 --> 37:10.532
- What's the worst thing
you've ever done?

37:10.576 --> 37:12.230
- What?

37:12.273 --> 37:14.232
- Like, the worst.

37:14.275 --> 37:17.409
Like, the all-time worst
possible thing.

37:17.452 --> 37:19.324
- It's kinda early...

37:19.367 --> 37:21.239
- Come on, Sadie.

37:21.282 --> 37:26.069
- Um...I cheated on
an English test.

37:26.113 --> 37:28.289
- W--how do you even do that?

37:28.333 --> 37:30.639
- We had to write
original poems,

37:30.683 --> 37:32.250
and I couldn't come up
with anything good,

37:32.293 --> 37:34.948
so I just used Miley Cyrus.

37:34.991 --> 37:35.949
- What song?

37:35.992 --> 37:37.516
- "Wrecking Ball."

37:37.559 --> 37:39.474
- That's a great song.

37:39.518 --> 37:41.998
- Am I in trouble now?

37:42.042 --> 37:44.087
- I mean, yeah, maybe.

37:44.131 --> 37:45.306
- But you asked.

37:45.350 --> 37:48.570
- All right.
We'll make a deal.

37:48.614 --> 37:53.358
You're off the hook if you
swear to cap it right there.

37:53.401 --> 37:54.663
- What do you mean?

37:57.449 --> 38:01.191
- Promise me that
you won't ever, ever

38:01.235 --> 38:04.934
do anything worse than that,
okay?

38:04.978 --> 38:07.937
- Okay.
- No, Sadie, I mean it.

38:07.981 --> 38:11.114
Look me in the eyes
and promise me right now.

38:12.464 --> 38:14.248
- Promise.

38:16.163 --> 38:18.426
Can I go shower?
I have school.

38:19.688 --> 38:21.734
- Yeah.
Go--go get clean.

38:40.666 --> 38:42.320
- Good match, counselor

38:48.021 --> 38:49.414
- Huh.

38:49.457 --> 38:51.633
Their key witness missed
the deposition again.

38:51.677 --> 38:54.288
- See, you worry too much.

38:55.202 --> 38:56.508
- Anything I need to know?

38:57.596 --> 38:59.641
- Nope.
- Client-attorney privilege.

38:59.685 --> 39:03.166
- All good.
- Are you being careful?

39:03.210 --> 39:04.603
- Always.

39:10.696 --> 39:12.350
- Did you go for a run?

39:12.393 --> 39:14.177
- If by "run" you mean

39:14.221 --> 39:16.571
a sad old man shuffle,
then yes.

39:16.615 --> 39:18.312
- Good for you.

39:18.356 --> 39:20.227
- Yeah, PT's starting
to pay off.

39:20.270 --> 39:22.142
- I found a therapist.

39:22.185 --> 39:24.492
- I thought you said
we couldn't afford one.

39:24.536 --> 39:26.494
- He's a grad student
at Wayne State.

39:26.538 --> 39:28.104
They need the hours,
so he's cheap.

39:28.148 --> 39:30.106
- Nice, how soon can he start?

39:30.150 --> 39:31.760
- I think this week.

39:31.804 --> 39:33.675
- I just want Kenny
to feel safe again, you know?

39:33.719 --> 39:35.242
- Me too.

39:36.243 --> 39:38.680
- Hey what do you
think about Krav Maga?

39:40.465 --> 39:42.205
- Huh?

39:42.249 --> 39:44.251
- It's this badass Israeli
like, fighting style.

39:44.294 --> 39:46.688
My PT guy says it'll make him
feel more in control.

39:50.170 --> 39:51.258
- Yeah, sure.

39:51.301 --> 39:52.433
- Cool.

39:55.131 --> 39:56.394
You okay?

39:56.437 --> 39:59.048
- Yeah, I've just had--had
too much coffee.

39:59.092 --> 40:01.355
- Slow down, tiger.

40:01.399 --> 40:03.270
I am going to go do abs.
