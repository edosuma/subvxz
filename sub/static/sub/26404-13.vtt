You made it out alive.
I think that qualifies.

41:58.437 --> 42:00.463
Mm. That night also ruined

42:00.488 --> 42:02.166
my prospects as Captain of 19,

42:02.191 --> 42:03.962
but... that's another conversation.

42:03.987 --> 42:05.769
That's also how you got me.

42:05.794 --> 42:07.819
Take a breath,

42:07.844 --> 42:09.476
let your eyes adjust...

42:10.268 --> 42:12.268
Could that be
a bright spot, too?

42:14.994 --> 42:16.431
Eat your food.
