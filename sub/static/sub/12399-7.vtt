Do you see what I see?

15:23.172 --> 15:26.630
I see why you forbid relationships
when you were running Division.

15:26.843 --> 15:30.176
Nikita is perceptive.
Michael is hiding something.

15:30.388 --> 15:33.255
And I have an idea what it might be.

15:38.146 --> 15:40.228
Well, it's all coming together.

15:42.108 --> 15:45.271
Contact the Watchman.
Tell him I have another assignment for him.

15:45.486 --> 15:48.569
I don't understand how he gets so close
to take these pictures.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.487
We all have our specialty.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.907
You have your knife,
the Watchman has his eye.

15:53.453 --> 15:56.820
I find the cracks on the surface.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.741
Anything yet?

16:01.961 --> 16:05.374
She should have responded by now.
What if she knows?

16:06.048 --> 16:07.424
She doesn't.

16:15.433 --> 16:20.894
Amanda encodes her orders
on regular websites using steganography.

16:32.325 --> 16:35.032
Why would Amanda have Sonya watching
the two of you?

16:35.244 --> 16:38.577
-She must have had someone following us.
-"Us"? Both of you?

16:39.832 --> 16:43.871
-We ran into each other this morning.
-Michael, stop.

16:48.966 --> 16:51.753
Nikita, a couple weeks ago,
I started using again.

16:53.429 --> 16:55.511
-What?
-Michael found out and confronted me.

16:55.723 --> 16:57.964
-She was supposed to tell you.
-"She"?

16:58.184 --> 17:00.891

-Using what?

Yes. Using what, Alex?

17:04.565 --> 17:06.180

-The fracture.

17:31.092 --> 17:34.676
Birkhoff's right. We set out to fake a fight
and here we are in a real one.

Well, this was my fault. I'll stand down.

17:41.102 --> 17:43.935

with what we have.

17:44.939 --> 17:47.351
We have confirmation
that Amanda is tailing us.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.274
-We've suspected it.
-I didn't see anyone. I was looking.

17:50.486 --> 17:53.523
If you were surveilled,
it had to be at extremely long range.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.570
Or extremely close.

17:57.118 --> 17:59.359
Amanda has another rogue on her side.

18:39.952 --> 18:43.115
Here's me and Alex
and here's the Watchman.

18:43.331 --> 18:45.071
How can you be sure that's him?

18:45.291 --> 18:48.374
We had Birkhoff run facial recog
through the surrounding cameras.

18:48.586 --> 18:51.749
He was able to track everyone
from the coffee cart about 12 blocks.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.249
This guy vanished in one.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.832
-"Vanished"?
MICHAEL: That's his specialty.

18:56.052 --> 18:59.089
The Watchman was Division's close
surveillance expert.

18:59.305 --> 19:03.014
He was able to change his appearance
at a moment's notice. He made it a habit.

19:03.225 --> 19:06.717
His job was to surveil a target
without making them aware.

19:07.313 --> 19:12.558
Only Percy and Amanda knew his name
and what he really looked like.

19:14.362 --> 19:16.273
-What's in his file?
-Never had one.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.946
His other job was to investigate
Division agents.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.989
He did routine checks on everyone.

19:21.202 --> 19:24.535
Observed them in their cover lives.
Made sure they didn't break rules.

19:24.747 --> 19:27.534
Which is why he only reported
to Percy and Amanda.

19:27.750 --> 19:29.490
He's about to write his last report.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.867
I'm still not sure about this.

19:32.088 --> 19:35.455
You want Michael and I to pretend
to rendezvous in some nightclub.

19:35.675 --> 19:38.917
Sonya will feed the address to Amanda.
This is a photo op.

19:39.261 --> 19:42.389
Wherever you go, the Watchman will follow.
And I will follow him.

19:42.598 --> 19:46.762
When he makes contact with Amanda,
we trace her location.

19:47.103 --> 19:49.640
And what about the second mole?
They're still in play.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.561
Birkhoff's got that under control.

19:52.483 --> 19:55.225
Okay, people, look alive.

19:55.444 --> 19:56.775
What are we doing down here?

19:57.613 --> 19:59.069
What's with all the questions?

20:00.533 --> 20:02.899
So the halon system went off...

20:03.119 --> 20:05.405
...covered the tower,
fried eight of the nodes.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.157
-Did it malfunction?
BIRKHOFF: No.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.659
Our fire-prevention system
became self-aware...

20:09.875 --> 20:12.457
...and decided to attack us
with whipped cream.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.287
That's a joke.

20:16.632 --> 20:19.840
Anyway, the point is,
we're in the middle of the hunt for Amanda.

20:26.267 --> 20:27.848
