This is for friends only.
This is a friend zone.

15:59.585 --> 16:04.288
So after what happened,
you know after everybody...

16:04.890 --> 16:06.324
I started working.

16:06.358 --> 16:10.094
Collecting data, collating,
running algorithms, doing

16:10.129 --> 16:11.763

There is global communication?

16:15.501 --> 16:18.569
Yeah, I mean some.
There are survivors out there.

16:18.604 --> 16:22.240
And you... alone keep this in operation?

16:22.274 --> 16:24.375
Uh, yeah. I mean I'm the only person here.

16:24.410 --> 16:28.279
Internet, satellites, the cameras in cities?

16:28.313 --> 16:29.714
Yes. Yes.

16:29.748 --> 16:32.250
Nanny cams, security cams, web cams.

16:32.284 --> 16:33.584
Anything that puts out a signal

16:33.619 --> 16:35.319
or is somehow connected to the grid

16:35.354 --> 16:37.288
I can reach out and touch it.

16:37.322 --> 16:38.923
I'm the NSA, baby.

16:38.957 --> 16:41.325
What a terrible burden.

16:41.360 --> 16:42.326
What?

16:42.361 --> 16:44.395
To see so much pain.

16:45.297 --> 16:48.232
One man cannot carry this alone.

16:51.503 --> 16:54.338
I'm sorry, friend.

16:55.574 --> 16:57.108
Just stop that.

16:57.142 --> 16:58.810
All right, back to the tour.

Oh yeah, you and I are gonna be fine.

17:08.520 --> 17:12.522
I got solar power, generators,
water filters, air filters.

17:12.558 --> 17:15.292
Enough food to last for a couple of decades.

17:15.327 --> 17:17.095
And enough booze to last for

17:17.128 --> 17:18.930

Yuri, listen to me.

17:43.822 --> 17:45.723
I need your help.

17:45.758 --> 17:47.558
I think

17:47.593 --> 17:51.062
that we can find out the reason
for the zombie apocalypse

17:51.096 --> 17:53.297
The answer is here somewhere.

17:53.699 --> 17:55.266
But we got to be careful.

17:55.300 --> 17:57.235
Somebody tried to hack into my system.

17:58.237 --> 18:00.471
There are other bases like this?

I don't know. I guess.

18:02.441 --> 18:06.444
Someone out there wants to know what I know.

18:06.779 --> 18:10.047
And we can't trust anybody.

Dog is sleepy, no?

29:35.013 --> 29:37.714
He was fine before you got here.

29:44.455 --> 29:46.123
Did you poison him?

Simon, you need to listen.

32:50.379 --> 32:51.946
How do you know my name?
