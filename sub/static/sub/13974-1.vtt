<i>[baby giggles]</i>

00:49.249 --> 00:51.817
<i>[woman] Happy birthday,</i>
<i>blow out the candles.</i>

00:53.553 --> 00:56.522
<i>- Happy birthday, Aidan.</i>
<i>- [man] Did you make a wish?</i>

00:56.524 --> 01:00.692
<i>- [indistinct singing]</i>
<i>- [dog howling]</i>

01:05.432 --> 01:07.099
<i>[woman] Max was</i>
<i>diagnosed with autism</i>

01:07.101 --> 01:09.334
<i>at the age of 32 months.</i>

01:09.336 --> 01:12.037
<i>Chester joined our</i>
<i>family six weeks ago.</i>

01:12.039 --> 01:14.573
<i>We don't get outbursts</i>
<i>in the middle of the night</i>
<i>any more.</i>

01:14.575 --> 01:17.009
<i>And I don't really worry</i>
<i>about Max, because I know</i>

01:17.011 --> 01:18.377
<i>that Chester's in there.</i>

01:18.379 --> 01:21.513
<i>He very much is a healing</i>
<i>balm for our family.</i>

01:24.684 --> 01:27.753
<i>[man] We arrived</i>
<i>at Ground Zero and we</i>
<i>immediately began to search.</i>

01:27.755 --> 01:29.955
<i>And then sometime on the</i>
<i>morning of September 12th</i>

01:29.957 --> 01:31.323
<i>Tracker got a hit.</i>

01:31.325 --> 01:33.125
<i>These rescue workers</i>
<i>later pulled a woman,</i>

01:33.127 --> 01:34.626
<i>the last survivor,</i>
<i>from the pile.</i>

01:34.628 --> 01:37.096
<i>And I'm extremely proud</i>
<i>of Tracker's involvement</i>

01:37.098 --> 01:38.864
<i>in the rescue.</i>

01:38.866 --> 01:40.999
<i>[woman] Get him! Who is it?</i>

01:41.001 --> 01:42.968
<i>Hey, it's Crazy!</i>

01:42.970 --> 01:44.536
<i>Crazy, you remember Daddy?</i>

01:44.538 --> 01:47.406
<i>Do you remember Daddy?</i>

01:47.408 --> 01:49.975
<i>I missed you so bad, honey.</i>
<i>I'm so sorry I went away.</i>

01:49.977 --> 01:51.243
<i>[woman] Oh, my gosh!</i>

01:51.245 --> 01:53.312
<i>I missed you so bad.</i>

02:41.861 --> 02:43.428
<i>[knocking]</i>

02:48.067 --> 02:49.301
<i>Yeah?</i>

02:49.303 --> 02:50.736
<i>[woman] Hi, we're</i>
<i>the ones that called</i>

02:50.738 --> 02:52.237
<i>about the puppies for sale.</i>

02:52.239 --> 02:53.939
<i>Oh.</i>

02:53.941 --> 02:56.175
<i>Jack.</i>

03:09.255 --> 03:12.391
<i>[man] Wow, you got</i>
<i>a lot of 'em.</i>

03:13.560 --> 03:15.794
<i>[Jack] Yeah,</i>
<i>about a 100 or so.</i>

03:15.796 --> 03:18.163
<i>[man] Must be hard</i>
<i>taking care of them all.</i>

03:18.165 --> 03:20.699
<i>- [dogs whining]</i>
<i>- [Jack] You're tellin' me.</i>

03:28.875 --> 03:31.376
<i>All right, you can</i>
<i>pick any one you like.</i>

03:32.412 --> 03:34.546
<i>but I think she's</i>
<i>the best of 'em.</i>

03:35.415 --> 03:37.482
<i>[man] What</i>
<i>do you think, honey?</i>

03:37.484 --> 03:39.251
<i>[woman] I think she's so cute.</i>

03:39.253 --> 03:42.754
<i>Hi. Hey, what's</i>
<i>wrong with her eye?</i>

03:43.523 --> 03:45.557
<i>[man] It looks infected.</i>

03:46.826 --> 03:48.894
<i>[Jack] Look, you can</i>
<i>look at any you want.</i>

03:48.896 --> 03:50.662
<i>I got four of 'em.</i>

03:52.065 --> 03:53.765
<i>[man] I only see three.</i>

03:53.767 --> 03:56.401
<i>[Jack] The other one's</i>
<i>around here somewhere.</i>

03:56.403 --> 03:58.437
<i>They sneak out of</i>
<i>the cage, you know?</i>

04:00.139 --> 04:02.908
<i>[man] Let's see this guy.</i>
<i>Come here, bud.</i>

04:05.144 --> 04:08.213
<i>- [man] How about him?</i>
<i>- [Jack] Good dog.</i>

04:08.215 --> 04:10.048
<i>[man] Yeah, hey, buddy.</i>

04:11.584 --> 04:13.185
<i>They all have their</i>
<i>shots and all that?</i>

04:13.187 --> 04:15.420
<i>[Jack] Yeah,</i>
<i>whatever you need.</i>

04:18.458 --> 04:21.560
<i>Hey, what you doin'?</i>
<i>What is that?</i>

04:21.562 --> 04:22.828
<i>[woman] Nothing, I just--</i>

04:22.830 --> 04:24.029
<i>She's got a damn camera!</i>

04:24.031 --> 04:25.430
<i>[Jack] Hey, what</i>
<i>are you doing?</i>

04:25.432 --> 04:27.432
<i>[woman] No, hey,</i>
<i>we're going, we're leaving!</i>

04:27.434 --> 04:28.600
<i>Gimme that,</i>
<i>this is private property.</i>

04:28.602 --> 04:29.735
Gimme that bag!

04:29.737 --> 04:30.836
<i>[woman] Come on,</i>
<i>we're going, we're going.</i>

04:30.838 --> 04:31.837
<i>Go, go.</i>

04:31.839 --> 04:34.039
<i>Jack, get the shotgun!</i>

04:34.041 --> 04:36.208
<i>[man] Keep running,</i>
<i>get to the car.</i>

04:49.656 --> 04:50.889
<i>[woman] Go, go, go.</i>

04:50.891 --> 04:52.124
<i>[Jack] Stop or I'll shoot.</i>

04:52.126 --> 04:55.861
<i>[panting] Are you okay?</i>

04:56.396 --> 04:58.730
<i>Yeah, you?</i>

04:58.732 --> 05:00.832
<i>[woman] Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

05:00.834 --> 05:03.302
<i>Tell me you got all that.</i>

05:03.304 --> 05:05.337
<i>Yeah, yeah, I got it.</i>

05:06.673 --> 05:08.440
[cheering]

05:15.548 --> 05:17.949
Fantastic, really.

05:17.951 --> 05:20.285
It's because of this
type of heroic work

05:20.287 --> 05:22.220
by people like
Sara and Trevor

05:22.222 --> 05:24.189
that I am proud to report
that Yates County

05:24.191 --> 05:27.059
now has one less puppy
mill to worry about.

05:27.061 --> 05:29.461
[cheering]

05:32.198 --> 05:34.032
This organization does not work

05:34.034 --> 05:38.236
without your passion and your
commitment, and your dedication.

05:38.238 --> 05:39.771
We're truly grateful.

05:39.773 --> 05:42.507
This morning I'm flying
to Los Angeles

05:42.509 --> 05:45.077
to be a guest on <i>Good Day USA,</i>
<i>where I will share</i>

05:45.079 --> 05:49.181
footage of the rescue we
conducted at this location.

05:49.183 --> 05:51.350
It's the first stop on
our summer media tour

05:51.352 --> 05:55.487
to raise funding and
awareness for UAPA.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.756
- [all] Yes.
- [cheering]

06:13.773 --> 06:16.141
Hey, Sara, Cassie
wants to see you

06:16.143 --> 06:18.610
in her office
as soon as possible.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.112
Okay, did she say why?

06:20.114 --> 06:22.581
No, but I'm sure it's
nothing but good news.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.182
You're really
making a difference.

06:24.184 --> 06:25.550
Thanks.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.621
[woman] Hey, me
and the girls are going

06:29.623 --> 06:30.989
out for drinks later,
you want to go?

06:30.991 --> 06:33.125
[woman 2] Yeah, I'd love to.

06:35.161 --> 06:36.728
Thank you, Hannah.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.264
Here's the latest
press release.

06:39.266 --> 06:40.665
Get it distributed, please.

06:41.667 --> 06:43.902
- There's the girl of the hour.
- [Sara] Hi.

06:43.904 --> 06:48.073
Hello. You know, Brad thinks
that you're our rising star,

06:48.075 --> 06:50.809
- and I couldn't agree more.
- Thank you.

06:50.811 --> 06:53.145
We're expanding.
We're hitting all
the state capitals.

06:53.147 --> 06:55.680
Rubbing elbows with
all the big donors.

06:55.682 --> 06:57.849
That's what I heard.
It's so exciting.

06:57.851 --> 07:01.586
And you, what do we
have you working on?

07:01.588 --> 07:03.155
Well, you know, I've been
doing a lot of research

07:03.157 --> 07:04.523
on our breeding reform strategy

07:04.525 --> 07:06.158
and it seems to be
really paying off.

07:06.160 --> 07:08.960
Oh, yeah, we're shutting down
breeders from here to San Diego.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.762
Austin. Albuquerque,
Sioux Falls,

07:10.764 --> 07:14.566
there's half dozen state
legislatures passing bills
right now

07:14.568 --> 07:16.134
keeping dogs
out of pet stores.

07:16.136 --> 07:17.936
Two years ago,
this was our dream.

07:17.938 --> 07:21.206
Now it's a reality.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.074
So, what do you
know about Prop 12?

07:23.076 --> 07:25.377
Breeders hate it,
I mean, it causes them

07:25.379 --> 07:27.279
to actually take care
of their animals.

07:27.281 --> 07:29.014
It eliminates that bottom line.

07:29.016 --> 07:30.615
We're gonna need
some more directors

07:30.617 --> 07:34.085
of operations on
our rescue missions.

07:34.087 --> 07:38.590
Won't get you rich,
but it's a big calling
card here in DC.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.592
His name is Daniel Holloway.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.027
He breeds hunting dogs.

07:42.029 --> 07:43.361
He's basically a good, old boy,

07:43.363 --> 07:45.964
and he's a very vocal
opponent to Prop 12,

07:45.966 --> 07:48.633
pretty much everything
that we stand for.

07:50.002 --> 07:52.437
<i>Today is the day that we,</i>
<i>as responsible dog breeders,</i>

07:52.439 --> 07:56.374
<i>cast our votes</i>
<i>against Proposition 12,</i>
<i>and stop the bureaucrats</i>

07:56.376 --> 07:58.176
<i>from trying to take</i>
<i>away our livelihood.</i>

07:58.178 --> 07:59.978
<i>- You ready to vote?</i>
<i>- [people] Yeah.</i>

07:59.980 --> 08:01.646
<i>[Daniel] Let's go.</i>

08:02.882 --> 08:06.384
Occasionally Daniel Holloway
takes in interns

08:06.386 --> 08:08.220
from Greenville University.

08:10.323 --> 08:13.291
Brad and I think
you'd be a perfect fit.

08:14.293 --> 08:15.927
Okay, what about Trevor?

08:15.929 --> 08:19.531
You know, to be honest,
I trust you more on this.

08:19.533 --> 08:21.733
Trevor can be your
support from here.

08:23.135 --> 08:25.103
I've been asking for an
assignment like that for months.

08:25.105 --> 08:28.006
I'm sorry, Trevor,
I don't make these decisions.

08:28.975 --> 08:30.308
Right.

08:37.316 --> 08:39.317
<i>[Cassie] Sara, we think that</i>
<i>Holloway operates</i>

08:39.318 --> 08:41.419
<i>through two separate websites.</i>

08:41.421 --> 08:43.621
<i>There's Holloway Farms</i>
<i>for his regular dogs,</i>

08:43.624 --> 08:46.358
<i>as well as Heavenly Farms</i>
<i>where he sells any dogs</i>

08:46.360 --> 08:49.394
<i>that get sick, so that he</i>
<i>doesn't lose any profit margin.</i>

08:49.396 --> 08:52.831
<i>At 500 bucks a pop,</i>
<i>that is huge business.</i>

08:58.771 --> 09:03.008
<i>We have a local contact</i>
<i>for you in Marshfield,</i>
<i>Jackie McConnell,</i>

09:03.010 --> 09:06.444
<i>Head of Animal Control.</i>
<i>You'll report directly to her.</i>

09:06.446 --> 09:08.613
<i>Posing as a vet</i>
<i>student is no small deal.</i>

09:08.615 --> 09:12.651
<i>You're gonna have to study,</i>
<i>so that you actually know wht</i>
<i>you're talking about.</i>

09:12.653 --> 09:15.120
What we really need are photos,

09:15.122 --> 09:18.256
<i>video, proof of negligence.</i>

09:18.258 --> 09:20.625
<i>Based on our intelligence</i>
<i>there was a bad case</i>

09:20.627 --> 09:23.161
<i>of Parvo Virus there recently.</i>

09:23.163 --> 09:26.264
<i>If we get Holloway,</i>
<i>I think that Prop 12 is done.</i>

09:26.266 --> 09:28.567
<i>And I think whoever</i>
<i>delivers that</i>

09:28.569 --> 09:31.036
is up for a very big promotion.

09:32.471 --> 09:34.606
[woman] Relax.

09:34.608 --> 09:38.410
My only daughter wants to
go undercover like the CIA

09:38.412 --> 09:40.111
and she tells me to relax?

09:40.113 --> 09:41.813
It's an important assignment.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.348
It means they have faith in me.

09:43.350 --> 09:44.950
But can they keep you safe?

09:44.952 --> 09:47.185
Honey, it's a non-profit.

09:47.187 --> 09:51.089
Who goes undercover
for a non-profit, really?

09:53.025 --> 09:54.593
Okay, what is it, Dad?

09:54.595 --> 09:56.027
Nothing, honey.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.596
No, come on, just say it.

09:57.598 --> 10:02.167
Well, I just thought that
this whole puppy-saving thing

10:02.169 --> 10:03.902
was something you were
doing on the side.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.770
I mean, is there a reason
we spent a hundred grand

10:05.772 --> 10:07.372
on a marketing degree?

10:07.374 --> 10:09.341
Dad, the UAPA
is one of the most

10:09.343 --> 10:11.610
respected organizations
in the country.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.478
Then why don't they pay you?

10:13.480 --> 10:15.780
What is with all
this sneaking around?

10:15.782 --> 10:18.583
Because it's something
that I believe in.

10:18.585 --> 10:20.418
Dog breeding is wrong.

10:20.420 --> 10:23.254
What about Mark
Stephens over at Unitel?

10:23.256 --> 10:26.691
- Oh, wow.
- Seriously, in six
months, you could become

10:26.693 --> 10:28.093
a marketing manager.

10:28.095 --> 10:29.995
Okay, but did you not hear
anything that I just said?

10:34.667 --> 10:37.302
So how long are you
gonna be out there?

10:37.304 --> 10:40.572
As long as it takes
for me to find something
on these low-lifes.

10:40.574 --> 10:42.340
Low-lifes?

10:42.342 --> 10:45.377
You can't go into this thing
with an attitude like that.

10:45.379 --> 10:47.779
As a journalist,
I would never begin a story

10:47.781 --> 10:49.080
with a presumption of guilt.

10:49.082 --> 10:51.483
These people may be
responsible breeders.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.052
There's no such thing.

10:54.054 --> 10:56.488
These people keep dogs
in horrible conditions

10:56.490 --> 10:58.890
and then they contribute
to overpopulation.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.825
Every time somebody
buys a designer puppy

11:00.827 --> 11:03.862
instead of adopting from
a shelter, a homeless animal
loses its chance

11:03.864 --> 11:05.664
at finding a home
and then it's euthanized.

11:05.666 --> 11:08.266
It's a horrible cycle,
and nobody wants to face it,

11:08.268 --> 11:09.701
but it's the truth.

11:09.703 --> 11:12.637
And we stop that,
that is what we do.

11:14.940 --> 11:16.941
Nothing's that black
and white, honey.

11:38.297 --> 11:40.098
Well, here goes nothing.

11:51.310 --> 11:54.245
Sara, right?
I'm Will Holloway.

11:54.247 --> 11:57.315
Hi, guess I was pretty
easy to spot, huh?

11:59.251 --> 12:02.687
You, um, you might
want to reconsider.

12:04.356 --> 12:05.757
Reconsider what?

12:05.759 --> 12:07.525
What you're wearing.

12:09.361 --> 12:12.163
It's just my
dad's conservative.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.299
Right.

12:17.837 --> 12:20.271
- Give you a hand?
- I'm good, I got it.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.108
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:27.713 --> 12:29.447
You just gotta jump in.

12:33.652 --> 12:36.421
- You got it.
- Yup, we're good, yup, good.

12:36.423 --> 12:37.722
Thank you.

12:54.607 --> 12:57.776
So, my mom tells me you're
going to Greenville, huh?

12:57.778 --> 13:01.346
- Vet tech program?
- Yeah, I love it.

13:01.348 --> 13:03.381
My professors are
really, really great.

13:03.383 --> 13:06.518
Your family, they've been
breeding dogs for a long time?

13:06.520 --> 13:08.019
Hah, yeah.

13:08.021 --> 13:12.390
Nice, is it something you're
looking to carry on or...

13:12.392 --> 13:14.292
Yeah, it looks that way now.

13:14.294 --> 13:17.629
You enjoy doing it, or...

13:18.430 --> 13:19.931
It's okay.

13:21.400 --> 13:24.302
[switches radio on]

13:24.304 --> 13:27.639
[country music plays]

14:04.710 --> 14:06.010
[girl] You're in trouble!

14:06.012 --> 14:08.079
You didn't fix the fence
like Dad asked you to,

14:08.081 --> 14:10.248
and Roger got out again.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.983
- I can take these.
- I got 'em.

14:11.985 --> 14:14.686
You must be Sara,
I'm Abigail.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.154
I am, nice to meet you.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.556
Can you tell the difference
between neuter and spay?

14:18.558 --> 14:20.825
I can, neutering
is done to a male,

14:20.827 --> 14:22.393
and spaying is done to a female.

14:22.395 --> 14:24.696
When should you start weaning
a puppy from its mother?

14:24.698 --> 14:26.364
Abby, just give her a break.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.900
No, it's okay, at
three to four weeks.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.902
What does heterozygous mean?

14:30.904 --> 14:32.070
Okay, we get it.

14:32.072 --> 14:34.772
That... Hi.
...is actually a tough one.

14:34.774 --> 14:36.040
See, I knew I'd get you!

14:36.042 --> 14:38.776
Abi, stop giving
our guest a hard time.

14:38.778 --> 14:41.746
Hi, I'm Liz Holloway,
nice to meet you.

14:41.748 --> 14:43.948
She doesn't know what
heterozygous means.

14:43.950 --> 14:47.185
Of course, she knows it
means one dominant and
one recessive gene.

14:47.187 --> 14:49.153
Exactly, I don't
know how I forgot that.

14:49.155 --> 14:52.156
She is all business,
just like her father.

14:53.359 --> 14:55.193
Speaking of which,
we should go meet him.

14:55.195 --> 14:57.228
I know what a zygote is, too.

14:57.230 --> 15:00.031
- That's great.
- Honey, come on!

15:01.901 --> 15:04.168
There's the guest house
where you'll be staying.

15:04.170 --> 15:05.637
Great.

15:05.639 --> 15:08.139
And here's a barn, we
converted it to a kennel

15:08.141 --> 15:09.507
a few years ago.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.643
It's beautiful.

15:22.321 --> 15:26.457
He got out, and then
got caught up on the fence

15:26.459 --> 15:27.859
trying to get back in.

15:27.861 --> 15:29.160
I was gonna fix that
as soon as I got back.

15:29.162 --> 15:30.862
Just put him in his cage.

15:32.598 --> 15:35.433
Honey, this is our
new intern, Sara.

15:37.169 --> 15:39.637
Mr. Holloway, very
nice to meet you.

15:39.639 --> 15:42.640
Don't get out in the
field much, do you?

15:42.642 --> 15:44.442
Well, you know,
that's why I'm here.

15:44.444 --> 15:45.944
I'd like to get my hands dirty.

15:45.946 --> 15:48.212
These ladies know there's
more to animals than carryin'

15:48.214 --> 15:49.981
'em around in
expensive handbags.

15:49.983 --> 15:52.517
Well, then I will
follow their lead.

15:52.519 --> 15:56.487
Honey, Sara was the
most qualified applicant.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.790
Must have been
slim pickings.

15:59.758 --> 16:01.492
May I?

16:06.131 --> 16:08.099
- She's due soon, right?
- Mm-hm.

16:09.601 --> 16:12.036
Hi, girl, good girl.
I'm just gonna...

16:15.975 --> 16:18.509
She's about three weeks out.

16:19.945 --> 16:22.213
It's gonna be a big litter.

16:23.282 --> 16:25.783
I'll give you a day...
see what you've got.

16:25.785 --> 16:27.986
Thank you.

16:27.988 --> 16:30.855
Honey, show Sara where
she's gonna be staying, okay?

16:31.690 --> 16:33.591
Follow me.

16:35.127 --> 16:37.295
You aren't afraid
of rattlers, are you?

16:37.297 --> 16:39.831
Uh, no.

16:41.667 --> 16:44.335
Honey, she was
the only applicant.

16:44.337 --> 16:45.770
We need help.

17:06.425 --> 17:10.261
Young lady, no cell
phones in my kennels, ever!

17:10.262 --> 17:11.628
- Okay, I'll go put it--
- Come on, hand it over.

17:11.631 --> 17:14.365
Don't worry, I won't
keep it forever.

17:17.935 --> 17:20.738
Forgot to tell you,
he just doesn't want

17:20.740 --> 17:22.673
anybody posting stuff.

17:27.913 --> 17:31.082
[dogs yelping]

17:42.928 --> 17:46.264
Well, welcome to my world.

18:20.265 --> 18:23.201
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.736
Little dog,
little bowl, got it?

18:25.738 --> 18:27.338
Yes, sir.

18:35.881 --> 18:37.582
Hey, what's back there?

18:40.085 --> 18:42.019
Nothing that concerns you.

18:43.622 --> 18:46.224
Can you just let
me-come here,

18:46.226 --> 18:48.259
can you just let me look?
Let me look.

18:48.261 --> 18:50.261
You're being timid.

18:50.263 --> 18:52.396
They're smart, they
know who's the boss.

18:52.398 --> 18:54.432
No, she just doesn't
want to cooperate.

18:54.434 --> 18:56.801
You're a second year tech

18:56.803 --> 18:58.369
and you haven't
done this before?

18:58.371 --> 19:00.238
No, I never said that.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.973
Stand over here.

19:05.310 --> 19:09.347
Stay. Remember, you're
the master, not the friend.

19:09.349 --> 19:13.384
Okay, get a good
look, open up the gums,

19:13.386 --> 19:17.622
teeth, that's how you
give a good check, okay?

19:17.624 --> 19:21.792
- Okay.
- Good girl, try again. Stay!

19:24.596 --> 19:29.100
Take care of her. Papers.

19:54.693 --> 19:57.128
- Hey, Will, oh!
- Oh, sorry.

19:57.130 --> 20:01.098
- Sorry.
- Sorry, I just gotta
keep this locked.

20:01.100 --> 20:04.235
No, I just wanted to see if
you needed help with anything.

20:04.237 --> 20:05.636
No, I'm good.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.138
Let's go see what
what everyone's up to.

20:07.140 --> 20:08.873
Yeah.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.020
You're almost done.

20:23.022 --> 20:25.957
Thanks. Okay, what's next?

20:40.606 --> 20:42.440
[knocking on door]

21:00.025 --> 21:02.493
Long day?

21:03.862 --> 21:05.930
Piece of cake.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.632
You'll get the hang of it.

21:09.167 --> 21:12.136
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

21:13.171 --> 21:14.372
Supper's almost ready.

21:14.374 --> 21:15.973
Thank you.

21:31.923 --> 21:33.858
Okay, I'm gonna
give you an easy one.

21:33.860 --> 21:35.826
Look up distemper, okay?

21:43.535 --> 21:45.269
You look nice.

21:45.271 --> 21:47.271
What are you reading?

22:10.595 --> 22:12.430
<i>So, I set it up so all</i>
<i>your video clips go into your</i>

22:12.432 --> 22:13.831

22:13.833 --> 22:17.168
Perfect, thank
you for doing that.

22:17.170 --> 22:19.136
There they are.

22:19.138 --> 22:22.206
<i>I'll log in remotely every</i>
<i>night and review the videos.</i>

22:22.208 --> 22:24.075
Sounds good, thanks again.

22:24.077 --> 22:28.112
<i>Yeah, I'll be</i>
<i>right here waiting.</i>

22:28.114 --> 22:29.680
Trevor, come on, don't--

22:29.682 --> 22:33.851
Or hang up on me. Okay.

22:40.492 --> 22:42.393
He's being polite,
we have a guest.

22:42.395 --> 22:43.761
You should try it some time.

22:43.763 --> 22:46.097
I washed the important parts.

22:47.366 --> 22:50.501
Daddy, did you know
that New York City

22:50.503 --> 22:52.570
was the murder capital
of the United States?

22:52.572 --> 22:55.539
Okay, Abi, put your book away.
We're about to eat dinner.

22:57.242 --> 22:59.377
Welcome, have a
seat over there.

22:59.379 --> 23:01.078
Thank you, everything
looks delicious.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.848
- Thank you.
- I want the drumsticks.

23:03.850 --> 23:06.550
You can only have one.
It might be Sara's
favorite part, honey.

23:06.552 --> 23:08.686
Oh, actually, none
for me, thank you.

23:08.688 --> 23:11.589
I'm a vegetarian, so I'll
just do potatoes and veggies.

23:11.591 --> 23:14.258
- You don't eat meat? Why?
- Hey!

23:14.260 --> 23:16.827
Uh, honey, when I
was in vet school,

23:16.829 --> 23:18.796
I was a vegetarian, too.

23:18.798 --> 23:22.133
And when I graduated,
I couldn't resist, so...

23:22.135 --> 23:23.567
Okay.

23:23.569 --> 23:26.070
Oh, uh--

23:26.872 --> 23:28.305
Are you an atheist, too?

23:28.307 --> 23:29.807
Uh, no.

23:29.809 --> 23:31.108
Good, grab a hand.

23:31.110 --> 23:33.110
Okay.

23:33.112 --> 23:37.081
Lord, we thank you
for this bounty which
will nourish our bodies...

24:08.847 --> 24:10.915
Oh, man, come on, Jackie.

24:28.667 --> 24:30.134
- Hey!
- Hi!

24:30.136 --> 24:32.036
- Jackie McConnell.
- Sara Gold.

24:32.038 --> 24:35.706
About three weeks ago I
found a Holloway Wirehair
running wild.

24:35.708 --> 24:37.441
Not in good
shape, he hadn't eaten.

24:37.443 --> 24:39.009
Yeah, I know,
I saw the photos.

24:39.011 --> 24:41.579
Yeah, so I picked him
up, I took him to Daniel,

24:41.581 --> 24:43.814
he looked me straight in the
face and denied it was his.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.850
Then he kicked me
off his property.

24:45.852 --> 24:48.319
So, I need DNA samples,

24:48.321 --> 24:50.654
preferably from every Wirehair
bitch on his property,

24:50.656 --> 24:52.490
so I can prove that dog is his.

24:52.492 --> 24:54.225
Okay, I can do that,
I can do that.

24:54.227 --> 24:55.826
We also need video.

24:55.828 --> 24:58.028
You got it, talk to you soon.

25:41.806 --> 25:45.476
Hey, what's he
got you doing now?

25:45.478 --> 25:49.280
Uh, I was just checking
to see if she was coming
into season.

25:49.282 --> 25:51.615
What, with that?

25:51.617 --> 25:55.553
Yeah, just doing a
standard cytology test.

25:57.022 --> 26:01.625
There, uh, there's
an easier way.

26:02.627 --> 26:03.827
Okay.

26:03.829 --> 26:07.464
All right, um, grab
your nose, right.

26:07.466 --> 26:09.767
- At the base.
- Okay.

26:09.769 --> 26:11.702
Here, do you feel that?
The firmness?

26:11.704 --> 26:14.805
- Yeah.
- That means that
she's not ready yet.

26:14.807 --> 26:16.574
Now touch your lower lip.

26:18.076 --> 26:20.177
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

26:20.179 --> 26:23.447
All right, you
feel the softness?

26:23.449 --> 26:25.583
That's how you can
tell that she's...

26:25.585 --> 26:29.153
that she's about to be in heat.

26:29.155 --> 26:31.589
Oh--

26:31.591 --> 26:35.392
Yeah, it's not very scientific,
but it's the easiest way.

26:35.394 --> 26:37.895
And if we miss a cycle,
it costs us a lot of money.

26:37.897 --> 26:40.598
Right, yeah, no, thanks,
thank you for the tips.

27:10.228 --> 27:14.331
Pete, what's going on,
how's the pup?

27:15.367 --> 27:17.001
The dog had Parvo.

27:17.003 --> 27:19.303
What do you mean
the dog had Parvo?

27:19.305 --> 27:20.971
I don't sell sick animals.

27:20.973 --> 27:22.640
Oh, yeah, just my dog?

27:22.642 --> 27:25.242
Look, just let me give
him the test, all right?

27:25.244 --> 27:26.977
It's too late.

27:26.979 --> 27:28.579
What do you mean
it's too late?

27:28.581 --> 27:32.016
- I had Jackie look at him.
- Jackie?

27:32.018 --> 27:35.019
Wait, Pete, why
don't you come inside.

27:35.021 --> 27:36.186
We could have a drink.

27:36.188 --> 27:38.022
[Pete] Look, I'm sorry, Liz,
there's just

27:38.024 --> 27:39.923
not that much
left to talk about.

27:39.925 --> 27:42.126
Why would you have
Jackie look at him,
when I sold you the pup?

27:42.128 --> 27:43.627
[Liz] Wait, let me examine him.

27:43.629 --> 27:45.996
[Pete] And Jackie was
right about you.

27:45.998 --> 27:49.066
[Liz] Pete, we can
make this right.

27:49.068 --> 27:50.968
Okay, I promise you.

27:55.507 --> 27:57.541
Good night, Pete.

28:00.445 --> 28:05.349
Damn! Dan, I don't understand.

28:05.351 --> 28:07.551
[Dan] Will? Will!

28:53.064 --> 28:55.899
I have got to tell you
again and again and again

28:55.901 --> 29:00.170
- that you gotta document--
- Dad, it was a mistake.

29:00.172 --> 29:01.872
[Dan] A mistake?

29:01.874 --> 29:03.674
Why do you keep
making these mistakes?

29:03.676 --> 29:06.343
You're a smart guy.
Is your heart not in it?

29:06.345 --> 29:10.147
No, no, no, that mistake
can put me in the
witch's crosshairs.

29:17.689 --> 29:19.256
What the hell was that?

29:39.477 --> 29:41.411
[Will] Probably just a raccoon.

29:47.152 --> 29:50.354
Look, fix this with Pete

29:50.356 --> 29:54.591
before he starts telling
the whole county, all right?

29:54.593 --> 29:56.226
Yes, sir.

30:15.880 --> 30:19.683
Will, hold on.
You going into town?

30:19.685 --> 30:22.619
- Yeah.
- Can I come with?

30:23.688 --> 30:25.889
For what?

30:25.891 --> 30:28.826
I just have to get some
stuff from the drug store.

30:48.146 --> 30:50.614
Just, uh, just wait here.

31:46.004 --> 31:47.304
You okay?

31:50.208 --> 31:52.042
So, what was that about?

31:52.044 --> 31:53.577
Nothing.

31:59.684 --> 32:01.418
I'm not...

32:01.420 --> 32:03.387
I'm not sure I
gave the dog we sold him

32:03.389 --> 32:06.556
his last set of shots,
and that's probably
why he got sick.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.526
They euthanized him.

32:18.469 --> 32:23.073
Will, you cannot beat
yourself up over this.

32:23.075 --> 32:25.075
It was an honest mistake.

32:25.710 --> 32:27.344
Tell that to my dad.

32:45.630 --> 32:47.397
- You have them all?
- They're all labeled.

32:47.399 --> 32:49.533
- How many?
- Fifteen in total.

32:49.535 --> 32:50.734
Also a guy
stopped by last night--

32:50.736 --> 32:52.235
- Pete Martin.
- Yeah, that's it.

32:52.237 --> 32:54.104
I checked that pup myself.
I warned him about Holloway.

32:54.106 --> 32:56.340
What about the other kennel,
the one in the back?

32:56.342 --> 32:58.275
It's all locked up, but it's
something I'm working on.

32:58.277 --> 33:01.078
Okay, just keep going, we're
gonna bring this thing down.

33:20.531 --> 33:22.132
What are you doing out here?

33:23.634 --> 33:25.435
[snarling]

33:33.177 --> 33:34.978
[distant whistling]

33:44.389 --> 33:46.823
Hey, who owns that
farm on the other side?

33:46.825 --> 33:48.992
Tanner's.

33:48.994 --> 33:50.927
Are they breeders?

33:50.929 --> 33:53.130
Back yard breeders.

33:53.132 --> 33:55.699
- Hunting dogs?
- Sometimes.

33:55.701 --> 33:57.601
Okay, well, when I went
for my run this morning

33:57.603 --> 34:00.037
I found this dog
and she came at me.

34:00.039 --> 34:03.140
Looked exactly
like one of yours,
the German Wirehair.

34:05.209 --> 34:06.643
She came at you?

34:06.645 --> 34:08.078
Yeah. I mean,
there was a fence

34:08.080 --> 34:09.045
and I got through it luckily

34:09.047 --> 34:10.914
or she definitely
would've bit me.

34:14.018 --> 34:15.752
Hold on a second.

34:18.956 --> 34:22.125
Those two Wirehairs that
went missing last year?

34:22.127 --> 34:24.194
Sara was out running
this morning,

34:24.196 --> 34:26.663
said a Wirehair tried to attack
her on Tanner's property.

34:26.665 --> 34:29.833
[Dan] What was she doing
on their property?

34:29.835 --> 34:32.335
Don't get like that,
I'll deal with this.

34:32.337 --> 34:33.904
No, we gotta have a
conversation with her,

34:33.906 --> 34:35.138
but keep an eye on her.

34:35.139 --> 34:37.440
Tell her not to go on
other people's property.

35:51.415 --> 35:54.417
Shh, shh, shh!

36:04.795 --> 36:06.329
- [dog barking]
- [gasps]

36:14.472 --> 36:15.672
You miss the sign?

36:15.674 --> 36:17.507
I'm sorry, I was
just out for a jog.

36:17.509 --> 36:19.276
You always jog over fences?

36:19.278 --> 36:22.746
Could have shot you, would
have been my right, too.

36:22.748 --> 36:25.682
I'm really sorry, I didn't
think anybody lived here.

36:26.884 --> 36:30.086
What do you think, H,
should we call the police?

36:31.088 --> 36:32.856
Please, I just saw a dog
and I thought maybe

36:32.858 --> 36:34.424
one of ours had gotten out or--

36:34.426 --> 36:35.692
One of yours?

36:35.694 --> 36:37.961
Yeah, yeah, I work
for Daniel Holloway.

36:44.135 --> 36:46.903
And you want to see our dogs?

36:48.406 --> 36:50.173
Go ahead.

36:56.247 --> 36:57.814
[Will] Jace!

36:59.217 --> 37:02.519
Sorry for the bother,
she's new around here.

37:02.521 --> 37:04.654
It won't happen again.

37:06.224 --> 37:09.693
Don't appreciate people
trespassing on our property.

37:09.695 --> 37:11.561
Neither do we.

37:11.563 --> 37:14.297
Some white trash stole
a couple of our dogs last year.

37:18.135 --> 37:19.869
What are you trying to say?

37:19.871 --> 37:24.541
Just that it'd be a
shame if someone got shot
for dog poaching.

37:38.789 --> 37:40.390
<i>[Will] What were you</i>
<i>doing over there?</i>

37:40.392 --> 37:43.627
[Sara] I saw the kennel and
I just heard barking, and...

37:44.495 --> 37:46.162
I don't know, okay,
I don't know.

37:46.164 --> 37:49.199
I told you, they're
backyarders, bad news.

37:49.201 --> 37:52.168
Just do us all a
favor and stay away.

37:52.170 --> 37:53.937
Don't you want your dogs back?

37:53.939 --> 37:55.305
Yeah, of course.

37:55.307 --> 37:56.806
But after they've been living
in that kind of filth,

37:56.808 --> 37:58.975
who knows what kind
of diseases they'd bring back.

37:58.977 --> 38:01.478
They're abusing those dogs,
Will, you cannot
just do nothing.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.513
So, what do you
expect me to do, huh?

38:03.515 --> 38:06.783
We can barely pay our bills
and maintain our kennel.

38:14.091 --> 38:16.660
[Sara] So why does
your dad do it?

38:18.296 --> 38:22.299
My great, great grandad's
name was Jack Holloway.

38:22.301 --> 38:25.201
He arrived, worked the land,

38:25.203 --> 38:27.570
and around World War I
he had enough money saved up

38:27.572 --> 38:29.873
to buy the entire valley.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.311
Two thousand acres.

38:37.114 --> 38:40.517
Back then, a hunting
dog was a necessity.

38:40.519 --> 38:44.054
He was also your friend and
your only tool to survive,

38:44.056 --> 38:45.789
provide for your family.

38:45.791 --> 38:49.259
Then the dust bowl hit and you
couldn't grow much out here.

38:49.261 --> 38:51.594
People had to turn to hunting.

38:51.596 --> 38:55.932
And Jack Holloway's hunting
dogs were the best around.

38:57.368 --> 39:01.838
That is a tradition
my dad is proud of.

39:01.840 --> 39:04.674
And more important, that's
the only life he's ever known.

39:08.679 --> 39:11.281
- [Sara] Are you proud of it?
- Yeah, of course.

39:11.283 --> 39:14.951
I'm just not sure I want to be
stuck out here like he is.

40:03.634 --> 40:06.069
[dog whimpering]

40:41.005 --> 40:42.672
What are you doing?

40:42.674 --> 40:43.940
Uh--

40:43.942 --> 40:45.475
Daniel told you not to
come in here, am I right?

40:45.477 --> 40:49.245
Yes, he told me not to,
but I just heard whimpering

40:49.247 --> 40:50.814
and so I thought
that I should come

40:50.816 --> 40:52.182
and make sure
everything was okay.

40:52.184 --> 40:53.650
I didn't know where you were.

40:53.652 --> 40:55.618
This is why I have such
a hard time getting him

40:55.620 --> 40:57.287
to take on interns.

40:57.289 --> 40:59.923
You kids think you know
everything and you don't!

41:01.091 --> 41:02.792
This is a quarantine area.

41:02.794 --> 41:05.128
This pup has distemper,
he got it from some stray

41:05.130 --> 41:07.597
who wandered onto the property
and he gave it to that one.

41:07.599 --> 41:12.469
You coming in here,
touching them, could make
the whole kennel sick.

41:14.738 --> 41:18.908
I am so sorry. Oh, God.

41:22.613 --> 41:25.615
Anyone else would
have just put 'em down.

41:30.254 --> 41:32.555
I will go, I am really sorry.

41:32.557 --> 41:34.824
- Wash your hands!
- Okay, I--

41:53.210 --> 41:54.777
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:54.779 --> 41:56.813
You want to see
something cool?

42:00.851 --> 42:03.786
Wow.

42:03.788 --> 42:06.656
Yeah, it used to
be my grandpa's.

42:06.658 --> 42:09.659
It was all rusted out and my
parents wanted to junk it,

42:09.661 --> 42:13.229
but I couldn't let that happen.

42:14.398 --> 42:16.933
It's beautiful.

42:16.935 --> 42:19.068
I did all the work myself.

42:19.070 --> 42:22.505
Took me almost five years.

42:22.507 --> 42:24.140
Impressive.

42:25.509 --> 42:27.343
You want to turn it over?

42:28.746 --> 42:31.748
[engine starts]

42:31.750 --> 42:34.250
[both laughing]

42:36.186 --> 42:38.187
Oh, gosh.

42:41.058 --> 42:45.295
I just-- I cannot believe
you did this all by yourself.

42:45.297 --> 42:47.630
Have you ever thought of
making a career of it?

42:48.899 --> 42:53.202
Yeah, I had some plans,
but a couple things happened

42:53.204 --> 42:55.238
and I had to stay here.

42:56.574 --> 42:58.441
What happened?

43:00.344 --> 43:03.980
Uh, my dad had
a heart attack

43:03.982 --> 43:06.316
a couple of months
before I was gonna leave.

43:06.318 --> 43:07.984
Oh, I am so sorry.

43:07.986 --> 43:11.354
No, doctor said he'd
make a full recovery,

43:11.356 --> 43:18.361
but my mom and Abi, just they
were so scared, you know?

43:18.363 --> 43:21.864
So I decided to
stay and help out.

43:21.866 --> 43:24.367
Well, your dad seems
pretty healthy to me.

43:24.369 --> 43:25.969
Why don't you go now?

43:27.738 --> 43:30.073
Doing what he does
is a lot of work.

43:31.075 --> 43:32.875
If anything ever
happened to him,

43:32.877 --> 43:35.578
I'd never be able
to forgive myself.

43:37.414 --> 43:39.816
Maybe when Abi gets older.

43:42.786 --> 43:45.221
You want to take it
to town tomorrow?

43:46.957 --> 43:48.791
Yeah.

43:51.929 --> 43:55.365
[country music plays]

44:09.613 --> 44:11.547
What's wrong?

44:12.116 --> 44:14.017
Nothing.

44:14.718 --> 44:16.586
Come on.

44:16.588 --> 44:18.721
No, I just--
I thought this thing was...

44:18.723 --> 44:21.324
you know, fast.

44:31.035 --> 44:32.835
That is more like it.

44:42.513 --> 44:44.681
So I just have to
grab a couple things.

44:44.683 --> 44:46.849
You want to just
meet back at the truck?

44:46.851 --> 44:48.518
Yeah.

44:53.924 --> 44:55.625
Hey, there, Sara.

44:55.627 --> 44:58.995
Jackie, no, no, no, Will is
here if he sees us together

44:58.997 --> 45:00.563
this would be really bad.

45:00.565 --> 45:02.298
Did you get anything new?

45:02.300 --> 45:04.801
Yeah, I got some video, but--

45:04.803 --> 45:07.203
- Great.
- No, the thing is--

45:07.205 --> 45:09.605
- The DNA's a match.
- What?

45:09.607 --> 45:12.041
All I need is one
more piece of evidence
and I can get a warrant.

45:12.043 --> 45:13.943
I don't think these
dogs are coming from them.

45:13.945 --> 45:16.012
I think the sick ones are
coming from another farm.

45:16.014 --> 45:17.480
It doesn't matter,
the DNA is a match.

45:17.482 --> 45:19.482
- It's their dog.
- Okay, I understand that,

45:19.484 --> 45:21.217
but they had dogs
stolen from them.

45:21.219 --> 45:23.853
And when their dogs are sick,
they put them in quarantine.

45:23.855 --> 45:25.354
What do you mean?

45:25.356 --> 45:26.856
Okay, I got into
the back kennel

45:26.858 --> 45:28.458
and they had two
dogs with distemper.

45:28.460 --> 45:29.926
What?

45:29.928 --> 45:32.028
No, Daniel, he
quarantines them, look.

45:42.406 --> 45:43.840
I need this.

45:43.842 --> 45:46.409
He quarantines them,
Jackie,

45:46.411 --> 45:47.777
that's a good thing,
when they are sick.

45:47.779 --> 45:49.312
That's fine,
but I need this.

45:49.314 --> 45:51.547
Send it to me now,
Dropbox, whatever.

45:51.549 --> 45:53.449
Okay? I need this.

46:00.758 --> 46:02.625
It's a really
nice truck, Will.

46:02.627 --> 46:06.195
If you ever change your mind,
the offer still stands, okay?

46:06.197 --> 46:08.364
I appreciate that, Mr. Grant.

46:08.366 --> 46:10.533
Bye, Will, we'll
see you later.

46:10.535 --> 46:12.435
Bye, Mrs. Grant.

46:14.972 --> 46:16.739
Hey.

46:16.741 --> 46:18.207
Who's that?

46:18.209 --> 46:21.410
Jim Grant, just a guy that
owns a car shop in town.

46:21.412 --> 46:25.148
Could I drive home,
actually?

46:26.717 --> 46:28.851
Uh...

46:30.554 --> 46:33.022
I'll give you
three stalls.

46:33.024 --> 46:34.390
I am not gonna stall.

46:44.034 --> 46:45.735
[truck stalls]

46:45.737 --> 46:48.771
[Sara] No, stop, no, no, no,
I'm gonna get it, no.

46:48.773 --> 46:51.774
- [Will] Do you want
me to drive?
- No.

46:53.310 --> 46:56.445
<i>Hey, so I've been in touch</i>
<i>with Jackie. She says</i>
<i>everything looks great.</i>

46:56.447 --> 46:58.047
What do you mean?

46:58.049 --> 46:59.415
<i>Uh, the evidence.</i>

46:59.417 --> 47:00.883
There isn't any evidence.

47:00.885 --> 47:04.353
<i>No, no, we're very confident.</i>
<i>We're almost there.</i>

47:04.355 --> 47:07.657
Cassie, no, I don't think
that you understand,
this isn't--

47:09.493 --> 47:10.960
I have to go,
I'll talk to you later.

47:10.962 --> 47:12.829
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

47:12.831 --> 47:14.397
No, it's okay, I was
just talking to my dad.

47:14.399 --> 47:15.932
I just need your help.

47:15.934 --> 47:17.633
Yeah, sure.

47:19.203 --> 47:21.137
[Sara chuckling]

47:22.206 --> 47:24.173
You did such a
good job, Momma.

47:24.175 --> 47:26.342
All the pups accounted for?

47:26.344 --> 47:28.611
Yes, sir, six total.

47:28.613 --> 47:30.646
Weighed and measured?

47:30.648 --> 47:32.148
Yes!

47:32.150 --> 47:33.683
[Liz] Awesome.

47:33.685 --> 47:35.785
Good job.

47:41.358 --> 47:46.362
Take it, bring it in,
bring it here.

47:46.364 --> 47:49.265
Good boy!
Good boy, good boy.

47:49.967 --> 47:52.201
Good boy! Good boy!

47:52.203 --> 47:55.137
Hold it, off.

47:55.139 --> 47:57.506
Ready, take it.

48:04.548 --> 48:06.315
[knocking on door]

48:06.317 --> 48:07.717
Come in.

48:08.919 --> 48:13.256
Hey... are you up
for a little adventure?

48:16.994 --> 48:19.395
Your family owns this?

48:19.397 --> 48:22.064
Yeah, we used to own more,

48:22.066 --> 48:25.501
but my dad's been selling off
some of it to make ends meet.

48:26.904 --> 48:29.805
It's like a living,
breathing screen saver.

48:30.941 --> 48:35.144
Yeah, this part,
this he will never sell.

48:41.451 --> 48:45.588
Uh, so, I got a call
from my intern professor.

48:46.023 --> 48:47.023
Yeah?

48:47.025 --> 48:51.060
Yeah, uh, I might
have to go early.

48:51.062 --> 48:53.396
They want me
to cut it short.

48:53.398 --> 48:56.432
Oh, yeah, that figures.

49:05.976 --> 49:08.244
What are you looking at?

49:08.246 --> 49:10.313
what, are you bored already,
city girl?

49:10.315 --> 49:13.616
No, I just-- I thought if
you're gonna make a move,

49:13.618 --> 49:15.484
you should maybe hurry up.

49:15.486 --> 49:19.388
Ssh-shh...
Look, look straight out.

49:21.058 --> 49:23.392
You see that?

49:23.394 --> 49:25.661
They're coming.
No, no, no, no, no.

49:27.397 --> 49:29.031
Will, they're coming.

49:29.033 --> 49:30.366
You can't move,
you can't move.

49:30.368 --> 49:33.069
- Don't move,
keep your eyes open!
- Are you crazy?

49:55.892 --> 49:58.861
So... What do you think?

50:00.297 --> 50:02.999
I think you're pretty smooth,
Will Holloway.

50:27.858 --> 50:29.291
Where are you going?

50:29.293 --> 50:30.793
Outside to lock up.

50:30.795 --> 50:32.428
I'll do it.

50:36.400 --> 50:38.100
Be careful.

51:20.944 --> 51:24.747
Easy, easy, good boy.

51:29.820 --> 51:31.454
[screaming] Daddy!

51:39.596 --> 51:41.330
Daddy! Daddy!

51:42.365 --> 51:44.934
Baby, baby!
Are you okay, are you okay?

51:44.936 --> 51:46.702
I'm fine.

51:46.704 --> 51:50.539
Don't anybody touch it.
It could be rabid.

51:50.541 --> 51:52.308
Where did it come from?

51:52.310 --> 51:54.410
[Will] It's one
of the Tanners' dogs.

51:54.412 --> 51:56.112
You all right, Dad?

51:56.114 --> 51:58.681
[panting] Yeah.

52:45.896 --> 52:47.496
<i>Daddy!</i>

53:47.057 --> 53:50.359
Daniel! Honey!

53:51.628 --> 53:52.928
What's up?

53:59.169 --> 54:00.970
What the hell is this?

54:04.274 --> 54:05.741
Will?

54:20.156 --> 54:22.224
Who are these people?

54:22.226 --> 54:23.492
[man] Daniel!

54:23.494 --> 54:27.896
Sheriff, what is this all about?

54:27.898 --> 54:31.433
Daniel Holloway, we have a
warrant to search your property.

54:32.402 --> 54:34.403
- Go ahead.
- All right, let's go!

54:34.405 --> 54:37.239
Wait, wait, wait, exactly
what am I being accused of?

54:37.241 --> 54:39.908
- Inhumane treatment of animals.
- On what basis?

54:42.412 --> 54:44.246
Did Jackie McConnell
put you up to this?

54:44.248 --> 54:48.350
Bart, whatever she's got you
believing, it's all lies.

54:48.352 --> 54:51.220
You just make sure
he stays out of my way.

54:52.055 --> 54:53.188
- What's going on?
- Move him!

54:53.190 --> 54:55.057
Sir, step aside.
We have a warrant.

54:55.059 --> 54:56.158
What?

54:56.160 --> 54:57.826
Goddammit, Bart,
you gotta stop them.

54:57.828 --> 54:59.295
Daniel, I need you to be calm.

54:59.297 --> 55:00.929
Come on, guys, get in there!

55:00.931 --> 55:02.831
Let's go! Let's go!

55:36.566 --> 55:38.100
What have we done?

55:38.102 --> 55:40.169
According to the paper,
these dogs are unhealthy.

55:40.171 --> 55:43.339
They are not unhealthy!
I am a vet, they are perfect--

55:44.407 --> 55:46.642
Wait, what are they
doing with our dog, sir?

55:46.644 --> 55:48.277
Those are my
personal house dogs.

55:48.279 --> 55:49.945
They're gonna kill them
dragging them out of there.

55:49.947 --> 55:52.781
Will, no, stop!

55:52.783 --> 55:54.850
Warrant says we can take all
the dogs on the premises.

55:54.852 --> 55:56.151
Put those dogs down!

55:56.153 --> 55:57.152
Sir, I need you to
stay out of our way.

55:57.154 --> 55:59.321
Listen, son,
you are not a cop.

55:59.323 --> 56:00.723
So don't even try to
tell me what to do.

56:00.725 --> 56:03.325
- Dad, no!
- Christ, Daniel!

56:03.327 --> 56:05.127
- Why'd you go and do that for?
- Get off of me!

56:05.129 --> 56:07.663
Do not move!

56:16.439 --> 56:21.043
<i>[man] Slow down a bit...</i>
<i>Yeah, yeah, that looks great.</i>

56:22.345 --> 56:23.812
<i>Turn it off.</i>

56:23.814 --> 56:25.080
What?

56:25.082 --> 56:26.949
I don't understand.
Why are you guys here?

56:26.951 --> 56:29.318
It's all thanks to
your footage, babe.

56:29.320 --> 56:30.919
What? What are
you talking about?

56:30.921 --> 56:33.389
Your video got us the warrant.

56:57.881 --> 56:59.348
What?

57:18.768 --> 57:20.803
Where's Abigail?

57:36.519 --> 57:38.053
Where are they gonna bring them?

57:38.055 --> 57:41.457
Don't worry, I'll
bring them home soon.

57:44.761 --> 57:46.695
I gotta get you inside, honey.

57:46.697 --> 57:48.430
Let's call our lawyer.

57:51.901 --> 57:53.802
I think they're taking
the dogs to the fairgrounds.

57:53.804 --> 57:56.171
- Well, how do you know?
- I overheard something.

57:56.173 --> 57:58.373
I gotta go with my
mom to the sheriff's--

57:58.375 --> 57:59.908
Can we just go there,
please, Will?

57:59.910 --> 58:01.710
Maybe there's something
that we can do, please?

58:01.712 --> 58:04.913
All right, just--
I gotta talk to my mom, okay?

58:33.476 --> 58:35.043
- Daniel!
- What?

58:35.045 --> 58:36.612
Promise me you're not
gonna do anything stupid.

58:36.614 --> 58:39.248
Does getting my dogs
back qualify as stupid?

58:39.250 --> 58:42.084
They seized your dogs legally.
It's a criminal investigation.

58:42.086 --> 58:44.620
We can't do anything until
they're finished examining them.

58:44.622 --> 58:46.321
Yeah, we'll see about that.

58:47.790 --> 58:50.158
Yeah, we got 'em all.

58:50.160 --> 58:52.127
Yeah, they're safe.

58:52.129 --> 58:54.129
- You son of a bitch!
- What--

58:54.131 --> 58:56.331
- What is wrong with you?
- Are you crazy?

58:56.333 --> 58:57.766
You doctored that
footage, Trevor.

58:57.768 --> 58:59.735
That dog was attacking his
daughter and that's the only
reason

58:59.737 --> 59:01.136
he did what he
did and you know it.

59:01.138 --> 59:03.105
Whoa, I don't
care why he did it.

59:03.107 --> 59:04.907
You just took away
a family's livelihood.

59:04.909 --> 59:08.577
A family that sells dogs like
they're product in a store.

59:08.579 --> 59:10.946
No, they are a family
that followed the law
and they cared for those dogs.

59:10.948 --> 59:14.383
A family that sells
hunting dogs bred
to stalk other animals!

59:14.385 --> 59:17.586
- Whose side are you on?
- They didn't
do anything wrong.

59:17.588 --> 59:21.990
My goal is to stop
all animal slavery,

59:21.992 --> 59:23.725
whatever it takes.

59:27.530 --> 59:30.132
Hey, Ma, yeah, it's
just like Sara said,

59:30.134 --> 59:31.800
<i>they're at the fairgrounds.</i>

59:31.802 --> 59:34.002
Honey, it's Will, he says
they're at the fairgrounds.

59:34.004 --> 59:35.537
All right, just tell
him we're on our way.

59:35.539 --> 59:37.739
Okay, stay where you
are, we're on our way.

59:42.145 --> 59:44.613
<i>[Dan] I don't know how</i>
<i>Jackie McConnell ever</i>
<i>got put in charge</i>

59:44.615 --> 59:46.648
of an organization
that cares for animals.

59:46.650 --> 59:49.251
She doesn't know anything
about caring for animals.

59:49.253 --> 59:51.486
Not a damn thing.

59:51.488 --> 59:52.988
Don't try to turn
it around on me.

59:52.990 --> 59:56.158
What, do you know
him or something?

59:56.160 --> 59:59.595
No, I was just trying
to get information.

59:59.597 --> 01:00:03.165
There's my dad. Come on.

01:00:10.607 --> 01:00:13.275
They got them in there
in the livestock holding.

01:00:13.277 --> 01:00:15.811
Livestock holding?

01:00:30.126 --> 01:00:33.328
This is pathetic!
What is wrong with you people?

01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:36.164
Hey! Hey, you
can't be in here!

01:00:36.166 --> 01:00:38.200
Mr. Holloway, you need
to leave right now, sir.

01:00:38.202 --> 01:00:40.035
- [Dan] No!
- Have it your way.

01:00:40.037 --> 01:00:42.571
I have right to see what kind of
environment you people
brought my dogs into.

01:00:42.573 --> 01:00:45.207
They're getting better care
here than you ever gave them.

01:00:45.209 --> 01:00:46.775
The hell they are!

01:00:46.777 --> 01:00:49.778
You've got a dozen pups in here
without their immunizations

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:53.015
and they're being exposed
to other dogs in a place
used for livestock!

01:00:53.017 --> 01:00:55.050
That's how disease spreads!

01:00:55.052 --> 01:00:57.753
We are being very careful.

01:00:57.755 --> 01:01:01.723
But there's another 24 that
haven't had their full round
of immunizations yet!

01:01:01.725 --> 01:01:02.958
At least look at their records!

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:05.093
We have everything
under control.

01:01:05.095 --> 01:01:06.662
- The hell you do!
- You need to leave!

01:01:06.664 --> 01:01:08.697
And what kind of crap are
you people feeding them?

01:01:08.699 --> 01:01:12.000
- Hey, I brought that myself!
- Well, it's garbage!

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:14.036
You'd be better off
feeding them the bag!

01:01:14.038 --> 01:01:15.437
Daniel, stop it!
Just stop it!

01:01:15.439 --> 01:01:17.472
- No!
- Mr. Holloway,
you need to leave.

01:01:17.474 --> 01:01:19.441
- Let go of him!
- Sir! You need to calm down!

01:01:19.443 --> 01:01:22.577
McConnell, you don't know
what the hell you're doing!

01:01:22.579 --> 01:01:24.179
[gasping]

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:28.250
- Daddy?
- Daniel! Daniel!

01:01:28.252 --> 01:01:31.987
- Dad!
- Daniel! Call 9-1-1!

01:01:33.122 --> 01:01:35.657
5-KING-28, I need a
paramedic to my location.

01:01:35.659 --> 01:01:38.326
I've got an adult male
down, he is unconscious.

01:01:46.769 --> 01:01:48.904
We're gonna have to take
him to the hospital,

01:01:48.906 --> 01:01:50.706
have the doctor
take a look at him.

01:01:50.708 --> 01:01:52.274
Make sure that he's okay.

01:01:52.276 --> 01:01:54.409
Wait, wait, wait.

01:01:58.214 --> 01:02:00.282
You're in charge.

01:02:07.857 --> 01:02:09.357
Please tell me he's okay.

01:02:09.359 --> 01:02:13.195
They're gonna take him to the
hospital and run some tests.

01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:15.897
My mom just wants
the family there,

01:02:15.899 --> 01:02:17.499
so can you get the truck home?

01:02:20.369 --> 01:02:21.603
Yeah.

01:02:25.441 --> 01:02:28.677
[reporter] Right now,
inside this barn, 86 dogs

01:02:28.679 --> 01:02:30.245
are getting check-ups,
food and water

01:02:30.247 --> 01:02:32.848
after the United Animal
Protection Agency took them

01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:34.750
<i>from what they</i>
<i>called a puppy mill.</i>

01:02:34.752 --> 01:02:37.152
<i>This video, provided</i>
<i>by the UAPA</i>

01:02:37.154 --> 01:02:39.020
<i>shows what officials</i>
<i>from the organization</i>

01:02:39.022 --> 01:02:41.056
<i>are calling unsanitary</i>
<i>conditions.</i>

01:02:41.058 --> 01:02:43.458
[Scott] We found these dogs in
absolutely horrible conditions.

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:46.795
<i>Living in dilapidated</i>
<i>buildings, walking around</i>

01:02:46.797 --> 01:02:48.897
<i>in their own urine,</i>
<i>their own feces.</i>

01:02:48.899 --> 01:02:50.966
<i>A lot of sharp objects, too.</i>

01:02:50.968 --> 01:02:53.335
<i>On a scale of one to ten,</i>
<i>this is definitely a nine.</i>

01:02:53.337 --> 01:02:55.904
<i>[Jackie] We're giving each</i>
<i>animal a full examination</i>

01:02:55.906 --> 01:02:59.274
<i>for signs of abuse, neglect,</i>
<i>malnutrition,</i>

01:02:59.276 --> 01:03:01.710
<i>or any other physical trauma</i>
<i>they may have received.</i>

01:03:01.712 --> 01:03:03.712
<i>We'll continue to provide</i>
<i>care for these animals</i>

01:03:03.714 --> 01:03:05.413
<i>as long as the investigation</i>
<i>continues.</i>

01:03:05.415 --> 01:03:08.250
<i>We're providing volunteers</i>
<i>scheduled on a daily basis.</i>

01:03:08.252 --> 01:03:10.385
<i>And that's a schedule</i>
<i>that will remain in place</i>

01:03:10.387 --> 01:03:12.187
<i>until the case is resolved.</i>

01:03:12.189 --> 01:03:15.624
<i>I'm Michael Ames reporting</i>
<i>for KLOTV News from Marshfield.</i>

01:03:55.231 --> 01:03:56.932
Hey.

01:03:58.835 --> 01:04:01.203
I have to tell you something.

01:04:01.205 --> 01:04:02.704
What's going on?

01:04:02.706 --> 01:04:05.373
Sara, are you happy?

01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:09.377
I hope whatever you got
out of all this is worth it.

01:04:10.446 --> 01:04:12.147
Ask her, Will...

01:04:12.149 --> 01:04:16.985
if she knows the people
that came in here and took
away all of our dogs.

01:04:16.987 --> 01:04:19.187
Do you know them?

01:04:23.226 --> 01:04:24.826
This whole time?

01:04:24.828 --> 01:04:27.362
I was sent here to just
look at your operation,

01:04:27.364 --> 01:04:29.865
to make sure that everything
was safe and in order.

01:04:29.867 --> 01:04:31.533
And was it?

01:04:31.535 --> 01:04:33.301
Or should I say, is it now?

01:04:34.503 --> 01:04:38.340
My husband, their father,
is lying in there on his back!

01:04:38.342 --> 01:04:40.709
Is everything in order?

01:04:40.711 --> 01:04:43.144
No, I'm--

01:04:43.779 --> 01:04:45.580
I'm so sorry.

01:04:45.582 --> 01:04:48.650
Let me be a witness, okay?
Let me go to them.

01:04:48.652 --> 01:04:51.586
Let me tell them what I've
seen here, because nothing
that you've done

01:04:51.588 --> 01:04:53.688
- is in violation of any law.
- I thought you were my friend!

01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:55.624
I am.

01:04:55.626 --> 01:04:58.126
It was not supposed to
happen like this, I swear!

01:04:58.128 --> 01:05:00.795
It was not--
We don't stand for this!

01:05:00.797 --> 01:05:03.665
We? Who are we?

01:05:03.667 --> 01:05:06.735
I want you to say it.
I want you to be honest with us.

01:05:06.737 --> 01:05:08.803
Who do you work for?

01:05:14.277 --> 01:05:19.481
I... work for the United
Animal Protection Agency.

01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:29.257
I want you to pack up your
things and get out of here!

01:05:35.498 --> 01:05:37.365
Please.

01:05:38.034 --> 01:05:40.402
- Just go.
- No, please.

01:05:40.404 --> 01:05:42.671
- Just go.
- Stop, just give me--

01:05:42.673 --> 01:05:44.506
Go!

01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:35.590
Hi, I'm Katie Simpson.

01:06:35.592 --> 01:06:38.326
You've seen me sing my heart
out onstage for years,

01:06:38.328 --> 01:06:41.363
but my heart really belongs
to these innocent animals.

01:06:41.365 --> 01:06:45.567
Every day, helpless animals are
abused, beaten, and neglected,

01:06:45.569 --> 01:06:47.669
and they're crying out for help.

01:06:47.671 --> 01:06:52.574
Please call the number on your
screen with a monthly gift to
the UAPA right now.

01:06:52.576 --> 01:06:54.776
<i>You'll help rescue animals</i>
<i>from their abusers</i>

01:06:54.778 --> 01:06:58.880
and provide medical care,
food, shelter and love.

01:06:58.882 --> 01:07:01.750
<i>Right now there's an animal</i>
<i>that needs you...</i>

01:07:01.752 --> 01:07:04.886
<i>and your call says,</i>
<i>"I'm here to help."</i>

01:07:04.888 --> 01:07:09.057
I love it. I'm gonna get Hannah
to put it on the air right away.

01:07:09.059 --> 01:07:12.727
I bet this is gonna double our
revenue from the last spot.

01:07:16.966 --> 01:07:18.767
Hey, superstar!

01:07:18.769 --> 01:07:20.902
Wait until you see
our new commercial.

01:07:20.904 --> 01:07:22.470
It is gonna go viral!

01:07:22.472 --> 01:07:24.773
Oh, and you're never
gonna believe who called me
this morning.

01:07:24.775 --> 01:07:27.409
The chairman of the Senate
Animal Welfare Committee.

01:07:27.411 --> 01:07:28.810
He called me!

01:07:28.812 --> 01:07:31.079
It turns out that this is
the largest

01:07:31.081 --> 01:07:33.815
puppy mill takedown
in state history!

01:07:33.817 --> 01:07:36.217
This is gonna
do huge things for us.

01:07:36.219 --> 01:07:37.652
We've really got his attention.

01:07:37.654 --> 01:07:40.488
He is pushing for hearings!
I mean, better late than never.

01:07:40.490 --> 01:07:45.326
At this point, we can get
anything we want,
because of you.

01:07:46.629 --> 01:07:49.364
Trevor doctored that video.

01:07:51.467 --> 01:07:56.071
Director of operations,
your own office,
an expense account.

01:07:56.073 --> 01:07:57.439
Did you not hear
what I just said?

01:07:57.441 --> 01:08:00.475
Do you want me to give this
promotion to somebody else?

01:08:00.477 --> 01:08:02.343
Trevor created a lie.

01:08:02.345 --> 01:08:04.679
He destroyed a family, Cassie.

01:08:04.681 --> 01:08:07.248
He took away their way of life,
their reputation.

01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:10.118
I think they did this
to themselves.

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:12.921
I have spent a lot of time with
that family, Cassie,

01:08:12.923 --> 01:08:16.758
and Daniel loves those dogs
the way he loves his children.

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:21.930
He's also the single biggest
opponent to Prop 12,

01:08:21.932 --> 01:08:23.965
and the video
wasn't the only evidence!

01:08:23.966 --> 01:08:28.136
Trevor and Scott were both at
his farm and said the conditions
were deplorable.

01:08:28.138 --> 01:08:30.337
Some of the worst
they have ever seen.

01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:31.639
That is a lie!

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:33.774
I was there!
I was there for weeks!

01:08:33.777 --> 01:08:37.278
- It's a difference of opinion.
- Of fact, Cassie, not opinion!

01:08:38.314 --> 01:08:41.448
These "facts" that
you're disputing,

01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:46.020
are they in any way
influenced by your relationship
with Holloway's son?

01:08:46.022 --> 01:08:50.258
Jackie says that the two of you
are quite cozy.

01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:54.629
Will and I are just--
I mean--

01:08:55.764 --> 01:09:00.167
This is a small victory
for the millions of animals

01:09:00.170 --> 01:09:03.171
who don't have a voice.

01:09:03.173 --> 01:09:05.506
Think about them.

01:09:05.509 --> 01:09:06.941
No matter
the collateral damage?

01:09:06.943 --> 01:09:09.377
Yeah, because
the war goes on.

01:09:09.379 --> 01:09:14.015
And I need my soldiers
committed 100 percent.

01:09:17.453 --> 01:09:20.121
This is not
what I signed up for.

01:09:22.625 --> 01:09:24.425
Okay.

01:09:28.863 --> 01:09:31.198
[man] Trevor, congratulations!

01:09:31.201 --> 01:09:34.102
[Trevor] Thank you.
I appreciate this opportunity.

01:09:36.138 --> 01:09:37.939
I'm going.

01:09:40.576 --> 01:09:44.179
Well, I think we should get
away, right? Go somewhere.

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:48.015
The Ettingers asked us to come
down for the long weekend,

01:09:48.018 --> 01:09:51.051
and Margaret's in town.
What about that?

01:09:51.054 --> 01:09:54.221
Mom, Margaret and I
were friends in, like,
the sixth grade.

01:09:54.224 --> 01:09:58.760
[sighing] Well,
it's just an idea.

01:09:58.762 --> 01:10:01.129
[father] It's a good idea.

01:10:01.131 --> 01:10:03.665
Honey, how did the interview
for Daggett go?

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:06.434
Fine.

01:10:06.436 --> 01:10:07.769
Just fine, or...?

01:10:07.771 --> 01:10:10.972
Uh, it went well,
very well.

01:10:10.974 --> 01:10:14.209
Well, do you think they're gonna
make an offer, or...?

01:10:14.211 --> 01:10:16.044
Probably.

01:10:16.046 --> 01:10:17.478
Probably.

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:18.646
That's fantastic!

01:10:18.648 --> 01:10:20.048
That is great news.
Look, we should--

01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:22.684
Okay, guys, can we just stop
doing this, please?

01:10:22.686 --> 01:10:24.752
Stop pretending like
nothing just happened.

01:10:24.754 --> 01:10:27.522
Because I just let
a lot of people down.

01:10:27.524 --> 01:10:29.357
[crying softly]

01:10:30.993 --> 01:10:33.361
- Baby... it's not your fault.
- No, it was wrong, Mom.

01:10:33.363 --> 01:10:36.197
That entire farm, that has been
in their family for generations,

01:10:36.199 --> 01:10:38.366
and they could lose
everything, and...

01:10:38.368 --> 01:10:40.602
I'm just supposed to sit here
and have dinner

01:10:40.604 --> 01:10:43.605
and pretend like nothing
happened and I can't,
because it was wrong.

01:10:43.607 --> 01:10:45.340
Honey--

01:10:57.686 --> 01:11:00.388
[line ringing]

01:11:09.365 --> 01:11:11.666
<i>[recorded] You've reached Will</i>

No, Mom, the interview's
at 11:00.

01:11:43.099 --> 01:11:46.401
Yes, I have plenty of time.

01:11:46.403 --> 01:11:49.570

Because if I do nothing, I won't
be able to live with myself.

01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:25.039
Yes, just enough for the plane
ticket, I promise.

01:12:26.442 --> 01:12:29.310
Thank you, Dad.

01:12:29.312 --> 01:12:30.978
I love you.

01:12:42.991 --> 01:12:46.594
And Dr. Reddick, what did you
find upon examining the dogs

01:12:46.596 --> 01:12:48.963
that were seized
at the Holloway property?

01:12:48.965 --> 01:12:51.799
They were living
in absolute squalor.

01:12:51.801 --> 01:12:53.968
They didn't have
adequate food or water.

01:12:53.970 --> 01:12:56.371
Many were lying
in their own feces.

01:12:56.373 --> 01:12:59.340
Upon further inspection
at the county fairgrounds,

01:12:59.342 --> 01:13:02.643
we found 32 of the dogs
were infested with roundworms.

01:13:02.645 --> 01:13:05.613
You don't need my expertise.
You just need common sense.

01:13:05.615 --> 01:13:10.585
Five people can't provide
adequate care to 100 dogs.

01:13:10.587 --> 01:13:13.321
That's the very definition
of negligence.

01:13:13.323 --> 01:13:16.157
Thank you. No further
questions, Your Honor.

01:13:19.728 --> 01:13:23.197
Doctor Laughton, aren't you,
Doctor Dale and Doctor Reddick

01:13:23.199 --> 01:13:25.700
all members of the UAPA's
board of directors?

01:13:25.702 --> 01:13:28.302
Yes. But we're also
veterinarians

01:13:28.304 --> 01:13:31.205
with 60 years of
combined experience.

01:13:31.207 --> 01:13:33.674
Is it the UAPA's stance
on dog breeding,

01:13:33.676 --> 01:13:36.010
even though it's
completely legal,

01:13:36.012 --> 01:13:37.812
that it just
shouldn't exist?

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:40.081
Yes.

01:13:40.883 --> 01:13:43.518
Thank you, nothing further.

01:13:44.987 --> 01:13:48.156
[people yelling, jeering]

01:13:48.158 --> 01:13:51.993
Please, back off.
Folks, back off.

01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:00.134
Look, I know you probably
want nothing to do with me.

01:14:00.136 --> 01:14:03.604
Let me help... please!

01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:07.508
We're in a "battle of experts."

01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:11.112
And judges and juries naturally
tend to side with experts.

01:14:11.114 --> 01:14:14.549
These "experts"
are nailing us to the wall.

01:14:14.551 --> 01:14:16.918
Okay, so what if we bring in
our own experts?

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:21.255
We have, but they're money,
they're big money and we can't
afford that.

01:14:21.257 --> 01:14:25.827
We're already having to sell the
back hundred... with the horses.

01:14:25.829 --> 01:14:27.762
No choice.

01:14:27.764 --> 01:14:29.597
What if I took the stand?

01:14:31.166 --> 01:14:35.536
Your involvement with Will
damages your credibility.

01:14:37.439 --> 01:14:40.007
Okay, then what do we do to win?

01:14:41.677 --> 01:14:45.246
Just one way:
we attack their credibility.

01:14:47.249 --> 01:14:50.318
So, it comes down to Prop 12,
the puppy mill reform bill.

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:54.255
Your dad is a target
because he's the opposition's
loudest voice.

01:14:54.257 --> 01:14:57.558
If they discredit him,
they discredit the opposition
and they win.

01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:59.894
- Case closed.
- "Puppy mill reform?"

01:14:59.896 --> 01:15:03.197
Yeah. Prop 12, it does things
like make it illegal

01:15:03.199 --> 01:15:05.099
to keep animals in cages
with wire floors.

01:15:05.101 --> 01:15:07.034
It would put the Tanners out
of business, so I don't get why

01:15:07.036 --> 01:15:09.070
- your dad wouldn't want that.
- You don't need new laws

01:15:09.072 --> 01:15:11.172
to put people like
the Tanners away.

01:15:11.174 --> 01:15:15.209
They're in violation of dozens
of existing animal welfare laws.

01:15:15.211 --> 01:15:17.745
Proposition 12 puts
breeders like them

01:15:17.747 --> 01:15:20.615
and breeders like us
in the same category.

01:15:21.316 --> 01:15:23.084
It'll put an end to breeding.

01:15:23.086 --> 01:15:25.620
That's what the bill
is designed to do,

01:15:25.622 --> 01:15:27.755
and that's why
my father's against it.

01:15:33.395 --> 01:15:35.463
Where are we going,
by the way?

01:15:35.465 --> 01:15:38.499
- To see Jackie.
- Why?

01:15:38.501 --> 01:15:39.867
Shelter's out of food.

01:15:39.869 --> 01:15:42.036
Can't afford to care
for all the dogs.

01:15:42.038 --> 01:15:44.071
What do you mean?

01:15:44.073 --> 01:15:46.641
I don't know,
not enough donations.

01:15:48.076 --> 01:15:49.877
Donations? I--

01:15:51.446 --> 01:15:55.216
All right, you can have these
two and then that's it.

01:15:55.218 --> 01:15:56.584
We're closed, you need to go.

01:15:56.586 --> 01:15:59.353
No, we still need to see
the Border Collie.

01:15:59.355 --> 01:16:02.690
Uh, I don't have time for you
to go back there now.

01:16:02.692 --> 01:16:04.659
That's ridiculous, I don't
understand what the big deal is.

01:16:04.661 --> 01:16:07.395
Yeah, she's our house dog.
Just let her see her.

01:16:07.397 --> 01:16:09.497
[Sara] Jackie,
it'll take a minute.

01:16:14.102 --> 01:16:16.070
She's with her foster family.

01:16:16.072 --> 01:16:18.272
Wait, what?
You fostered dogs out?

01:16:18.274 --> 01:16:20.141
- We had no choice.
- What about her pups?

01:16:20.143 --> 01:16:21.876
We're running low on food.

01:16:21.878 --> 01:16:24.145
That's impossible,
the UAPA gives you food.

01:16:24.147 --> 01:16:25.546
Let me see your inventory list.

01:16:25.548 --> 01:16:28.015
You got an inventory list,
don't you?

01:16:28.017 --> 01:16:31.385
We're run by part-time
volunteers, people who
give us their time.

01:16:31.387 --> 01:16:34.121
Vincent and I, we do our best.

01:16:34.123 --> 01:16:35.890
Those dogs are evidence
in a trial.

01:16:35.892 --> 01:16:37.959
I'm sorry, but you're done here.

01:16:53.675 --> 01:16:55.610
- [Sara] What would they
have done with them?
- [Will] I don't know.

01:16:55.612 --> 01:16:59.113
The shelter, they run these
adoption fairs at local pet
stores in town.

01:16:59.115 --> 01:17:00.648
Maybe they took them there.

01:17:00.650 --> 01:17:02.483
But those dogs
are state evidence, so wouldn't
giving them away

01:17:02.485 --> 01:17:05.219
be considered obstruction
of justice? Negligence?

01:17:05.221 --> 01:17:09.457
We'd, uh...
We'd have to prove it.

01:17:09.459 --> 01:17:13.794
Miss McConnell advised us not
to buy a dog from Mr. Holloway.

01:17:13.796 --> 01:17:17.031
[prosecutor] Really?
Did she say why?

01:17:17.033 --> 01:17:19.233
Mm-hm, said he was
running a puppy mill.

01:17:19.235 --> 01:17:24.605
I didn't listen and
I bought a dog from
Mr. Holloway anyway.

01:17:24.607 --> 01:17:25.806
What then?

01:17:25.808 --> 01:17:28.876
Two weeks later the dog
got really sick.

01:17:28.878 --> 01:17:32.913
It had loss of appetite,
fatigue, diarrhea,

01:17:32.915 --> 01:17:35.216
all symptoms of the Parvo virus.

01:17:35.218 --> 01:17:38.386
What happened then?

01:17:38.388 --> 01:17:42.089
We took the dog to Miss
McConnell's animal shelter,

01:17:42.091 --> 01:17:45.559
where it tested positive
for Parvo.

01:17:46.294 --> 01:17:47.828
Were you upset?

01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:51.432
Of course. I had just paid
$1,000 for this dog.

01:17:51.434 --> 01:17:54.101
It should have
had all of its shots.

01:17:54.103 --> 01:17:58.105
Mr. Morton, what happened
to your dog?

01:17:59.741 --> 01:18:03.177
We had to euthanize him.
Miss McConnell recommended it.

01:18:03.179 --> 01:18:04.578
[prosecutor] Thank you.

01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:06.947
When a dog is vaccinated
for the Parvo virus,

01:18:06.949 --> 01:18:11.552
it may test positive
for the virus, because
of the vaccine.

01:18:11.554 --> 01:18:13.020
What about the dog's symptoms?

01:18:13.022 --> 01:18:16.057
The dog may have had a type
of common hookworm,

01:18:16.059 --> 01:18:18.592
which is treatable and not
life threatening.

01:18:18.594 --> 01:18:23.197
That dog should
have been tested for worms
before it was euthanized.

01:18:23.199 --> 01:18:26.300
Then, why did you
refund Mr. Morton's money?

01:18:26.302 --> 01:18:29.003
Because my son wasn't 100
percent certain

01:18:29.005 --> 01:18:31.639
that he had finished
the last round of shots.

01:18:31.641 --> 01:18:36.010
Without an autopsy, we
couldn't be certain
what the dog died from.

01:18:36.012 --> 01:18:39.580
Now, of course, we want our
customers to be satisfied.

01:18:39.582 --> 01:18:42.917
We take great pride in our work.

01:18:42.919 --> 01:18:45.720
Thank you, nothing further.

01:18:46.655 --> 01:18:48.756
- Redirect, your Honor?
- Proceed.

01:18:48.758 --> 01:18:53.661
So, Mrs. Holloway,
your son admitted

01:18:53.663 --> 01:18:56.464
to possible negligence
and took responsibility

01:18:56.466 --> 01:18:59.567
for the death of Mr. Morton's
dog? Is that correct?

01:18:59.569 --> 01:19:02.603
- Uh, yes, but--
- Mrs. Holloway,

01:19:02.605 --> 01:19:04.805
are you a licensed veterinarian?

01:19:04.807 --> 01:19:08.709
Due to certain health issues
at home,

01:19:08.711 --> 01:19:11.378
I let my certification
lapse, but I--

01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:14.014
- Thank you, nothing further.
- Sir, if I may!

01:19:14.016 --> 01:19:17.384
We love animals.
I used to work at a shelter.

01:19:17.386 --> 01:19:19.653
That's why I became a vet.
Why--

01:19:19.655 --> 01:19:22.289
Thank you! Thank you, Mrs.
Holloway, nothing further!

01:19:23.558 --> 01:19:25.426
Yeah, we gave away 12.

01:19:25.428 --> 01:19:27.762
I'm gonna need those addresses.

01:19:29.464 --> 01:19:31.031
Where did you get the dog?

01:19:31.033 --> 01:19:32.600
I got him at a shelter.

01:19:32.602 --> 01:19:34.735
I'm really sorry,
but he's private property

01:19:34.737 --> 01:19:36.570
and we're gonna
have to take him back.

01:19:36.572 --> 01:19:38.439
I don't understand, why would
somebody give him to me

01:19:38.441 --> 01:19:42.276
if he belonged to somebody else?

01:19:42.278 --> 01:19:44.545
Did you adopt a German Wirehair
from the shelter recently?

01:19:44.547 --> 01:19:46.046
Yeah, I did.

01:19:46.048 --> 01:19:48.415
I'm with UAPA, the dog was
given to you by mistake,

01:19:48.417 --> 01:19:49.917
and we're going to need
to take him back.

01:19:49.919 --> 01:19:51.819
You're with who?

01:19:56.224 --> 01:19:58.459
That makes five.

01:20:01.696 --> 01:20:04.832
This is footage of the raid
on the Holloway farm,

01:20:04.834 --> 01:20:07.835
shot by the UAPA.

01:20:07.837 --> 01:20:11.806
Notice the dogs are clean,
well cared for,

01:20:11.808 --> 01:20:14.842
well fed, and not in distress.

01:20:14.844 --> 01:20:17.978
Mr. Joiner, if you claim
to be an expert in this field,

01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:20.181
how can you rate these
dogs as a "nine,"

01:20:20.183 --> 01:20:22.983
in a scale of one to ten,
ten being the worst?

01:20:22.985 --> 01:20:25.319
The dogs were skittish...
poorly socialized.

01:20:25.321 --> 01:20:27.855
I saw skin infections,
eye infections... parasites.

01:20:27.857 --> 01:20:31.392
Come on, Mr. Joiner,
out of 100 dogs, only six
had minor diseases.

01:20:31.394 --> 01:20:34.595
Common ailments that
were already being treated.

01:20:34.597 --> 01:20:36.096
Two of which had distemper.

01:20:36.098 --> 01:20:38.666
The two dogs with distemper
were quarantined properly

01:20:38.668 --> 01:20:41.735
and on their way to a full
recovery, before your raid.

01:20:41.737 --> 01:20:43.671
- That's it, right?
- Yeah.

01:20:43.673 --> 01:20:46.040
Okay, then that makes
29 dogs unaccounted for.

01:20:46.042 --> 01:20:47.374
So where'd they go?

01:20:47.376 --> 01:20:48.943
I don't know,
but this is negligence.

01:20:48.945 --> 01:20:50.377
Yeah, they got rid
of state's evidence.

01:20:50.379 --> 01:20:52.079
You can't prove
it was intentional.

01:20:52.081 --> 01:20:53.948
Well, why not?

01:20:53.950 --> 01:20:56.717
Because this is an organization
run by volunteers.

01:20:56.719 --> 01:20:58.452
Non-professionals.

01:20:58.454 --> 01:21:01.856
They could argue that
those types of people
will make mistakes.

01:21:01.858 --> 01:21:05.526
So what if we tied someone who
is a professional into it?

01:21:05.528 --> 01:21:09.330
That could help.
What are you thinking?

01:21:17.806 --> 01:21:21.442
Mr. Holloway, have you ever
abused your dogs?

01:21:21.444 --> 01:21:22.543
Never.

01:21:22.545 --> 01:21:25.946
And hookworms, roundworms,
pinworms...

01:21:25.948 --> 01:21:29.216
are any of these
things life-threatening
to your animals?

01:21:29.218 --> 01:21:32.853
No, not so long as
proper de-worming protocols
are followed,

01:21:32.855 --> 01:21:35.556
- which is what we do.
- Even with your family dog?

01:21:35.558 --> 01:21:38.325
Of course.

01:21:38.327 --> 01:21:40.628
Where is your family dog,
Mr. Holloway?

01:21:40.630 --> 01:21:44.131
My family dog, Delilah, was
taken from my home

01:21:44.133 --> 01:21:48.669
by UAPA, along with
her newborn litter.

01:21:48.671 --> 01:21:51.372
[attorney] Do you know
where your dogs are now?

01:21:53.642 --> 01:21:55.276
No, I don't.

01:21:56.111 --> 01:21:57.645
Nothing further, thank you.

01:21:57.647 --> 01:21:59.747
[judge] Your witness,
Mr. Landon.

01:21:59.749 --> 01:22:03.050
[Landon] Your Honor.
Mr. Holloway...

01:22:03.052 --> 01:22:08.989
have you ever killed an animal
in a cruel fashion?

01:22:08.991 --> 01:22:10.925
Of course, not.

01:22:10.927 --> 01:22:15.296
Ladies and gentlemen, please
direct your attention to the
monitor.

01:22:24.306 --> 01:22:25.539
Mr. Holloway--

01:22:25.541 --> 01:22:27.341
That video is a lie!

01:22:27.343 --> 01:22:29.910
It was altered, as we've
explained before!

01:22:29.912 --> 01:22:31.946
That isn't the question.
I just want to know,

01:22:31.948 --> 01:22:34.581
is that you hitting the dog
with the shovel or not?

01:22:34.583 --> 01:22:35.950
- Objection!
- I'll allow it.

01:22:35.952 --> 01:22:37.551
Answer the question,
Mr. Holloway.

01:22:37.553 --> 01:22:40.955
That dog got
into my yard accidentally,

01:22:40.957 --> 01:22:42.723
and was threatening
to attack my daughter.

01:22:42.725 --> 01:22:45.759
Who is conveniently off-screen,
or so you claim.

01:22:45.761 --> 01:22:48.262
No, that dog, it was
threatening my family.

01:22:48.264 --> 01:22:51.398
And yes, I did, and if I
had to do it again, I would!

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:55.336
Well, that sounds like
the actions of a very
violent individual!

01:22:55.338 --> 01:22:57.071
- Objection!
- Mr. Landon!

01:22:57.073 --> 01:22:59.306
No, you'd do the same thing,
I'm sure!

01:22:59.308 --> 01:23:01.241
I'm not the one on trial here,
Mr. Holloway!

01:23:01.243 --> 01:23:04.144
- Objection!
- Mr. Landon! Order! Order!

01:23:04.146 --> 01:23:06.046
I have nothing further.

01:23:06.048 --> 01:23:08.282
I am putting us
into a 30-minute recess

01:23:08.284 --> 01:23:11.618
and I want to see both of
the counsels in my chambers now!

01:23:16.558 --> 01:23:19.526
[people shouting, jeering]

01:23:42.117 --> 01:23:43.917
[Sara] Can I talk to you
for a minute?

01:23:47.655 --> 01:23:49.123
Can't.

01:23:49.125 --> 01:23:50.657
I just want to go inside.
It won't take long.

01:23:50.659 --> 01:23:53.694
No. No way. Can't.

01:23:53.696 --> 01:23:55.763
Then can you tell me why
29 of the Holloway dogs

01:23:55.765 --> 01:23:57.698
are completely unaccounted for?

01:24:01.036 --> 01:24:02.836
I'm not talking to you.

01:24:05.974 --> 01:24:07.608
You know what I think?

01:24:07.610 --> 01:24:09.676
I think you know
what happened to them,

01:24:09.678 --> 01:24:11.812
and I think you're a good
person and you want to help me.

01:24:19.921 --> 01:24:22.256
My wife's not well.

01:24:23.758 --> 01:24:25.859
I can't
afford to lose this job.

01:24:25.861 --> 01:24:29.430
So you think it's okay to let
an innocent man sit in jail

01:24:29.432 --> 01:24:31.832
for the rest of his life?

01:24:37.172 --> 01:24:40.507
Couple weeks ago,
we lost the fairground location.

01:24:40.509 --> 01:24:43.644
Had to bring
the Holloway dogs here.

01:24:43.646 --> 01:24:47.314
There's usually only
50 dogs in there.

01:24:47.316 --> 01:24:50.551
With the Holloway dogs,
there were 150.

01:24:53.721 --> 01:24:55.756
They were on top
of one another.

01:24:57.492 --> 01:24:59.893
Didn't have enough food
to feed them.

01:25:01.963 --> 01:25:03.797
So tell me what did you did.

01:25:15.877 --> 01:25:18.412
I... I just need you
to understand

01:25:18.414 --> 01:25:20.881
that it's tough
for me to find work.

01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:23.650
Why's that?

01:25:25.553 --> 01:25:29.056
Done time, that's all,
it's just tough.

01:25:38.066 --> 01:25:40.868
Oh, my God,
what is that smell?

01:25:44.038 --> 01:25:45.873
Vincent, where are we?

01:25:54.716 --> 01:25:56.350
We're here.

01:26:17.605 --> 01:26:19.239
Vincent?

01:26:20.842 --> 01:26:22.409
Vincent!

01:26:48.536 --> 01:26:50.204
[Vincent] Over here!

01:27:16.097 --> 01:27:19.032
Parvo killed a dozen
of them overnight.

01:27:21.636 --> 01:27:23.770
Had to put down the rest.

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:28.175
Jackie, she didn't know
what to do.

01:27:29.544 --> 01:27:34.648
Some bigwig from UAPA called and
said for me to dump them.

01:27:36.184 --> 01:27:38.819
Jackie told me to do
as she said.

01:27:43.124 --> 01:27:48.128
I was part of a dog training
program in prison.

01:27:48.130 --> 01:27:51.598
[voice breaking] Dogs helped
turn my life around.

01:27:54.936 --> 01:27:56.503
I couldn't do it.

01:27:56.505 --> 01:27:59.539
I couldn't just toss 'em up
there with all the other trash.

01:28:00.842 --> 01:28:05.279
So I gave them a proper
burial... right here.

01:28:08.383 --> 01:28:10.717
Vincent, what happened
to the Collie?

01:28:13.087 --> 01:28:16.990
Caught kennel cough from
another dog. She's gone.

01:28:19.794 --> 01:28:21.595
And her puppies?

01:28:22.730 --> 01:28:25.399
I'm not sure.

01:28:26.434 --> 01:28:29.136
[crying] I'm sorry.

01:28:31.339 --> 01:28:33.774
Hey, Hannah, it's Sara.

01:28:33.776 --> 01:28:36.376
You ready to make
a real difference?

01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:40.981
<i>[Cassie] So what made you</i>
<i>change your mind?</i>

01:28:40.983 --> 01:28:44.117
I am so sorry
about our last conversation,

01:28:44.119 --> 01:28:46.687
and I have learned
a lot in all of this.

01:28:46.689 --> 01:28:48.889
Hmm. Like what?

01:28:48.891 --> 01:28:50.957
Well, I went to Jackie's
animal shelter,

01:28:50.959 --> 01:28:54.728
and it hit me that even
with all of the money
that UAPA has given her,

01:28:54.730 --> 01:28:56.630
she still couldn't
take care of those animals.

01:28:56.632 --> 01:28:58.198
That's right.

01:28:59.167 --> 01:29:01.068
I just didn't realize
how important

01:29:01.070 --> 01:29:02.569
the organization really is.

01:29:02.571 --> 01:29:05.605
The organization is the only
thing that matters, Sara.

01:29:05.607 --> 01:29:08.175
I know, I know, I guess
what I mean is...

01:29:08.177 --> 01:29:10.410
that makes sense to me now.

01:29:13.181 --> 01:29:16.183
- She said she'll be here.
- She better be.

01:29:19.087 --> 01:29:21.588
[attorney] You have been
an animal control officer
for how long?

01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:22.989
Five years.

01:29:22.991 --> 01:29:24.758
Do you consider yourself
an expert

01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:25.992
in the field of animal care?

01:29:25.994 --> 01:29:27.761
Yes, I do.

01:29:27.763 --> 01:29:29.930
During the raid, you used
a UAPA truck

01:29:29.932 --> 01:29:32.032
to transport
Mr. Holloway's dog.

01:29:32.034 --> 01:29:37.070
That same truck had been used
in previous rescues to transport
diseased animals, correct?

01:29:37.072 --> 01:29:39.005
Yes.

01:29:39.007 --> 01:29:43.844
Was the truck properly
disinfected before the raid
on the Holloway farm?

01:29:43.846 --> 01:29:47.180
I'm sure the UAPA team
took care of that.

01:29:47.182 --> 01:29:49.750
Do you have any records
to support this?

01:29:50.218 --> 01:29:51.351
No.

01:29:51.353 --> 01:29:53.353
And the barn at the county
Fairgrounds,

01:29:53.355 --> 01:29:55.722
it's frequently
used to store livestock.

01:29:55.724 --> 01:29:58.692
Were proper bio-security
measures taken there?

01:29:58.694 --> 01:30:00.827
The Holloway dogs were
in such bad shape

01:30:00.829 --> 01:30:02.696
that those measures
weren't necessary.

01:30:02.698 --> 01:30:05.098
Upon seizure, how many
of Mr. Holloway's dogs

01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:07.567
tested positive
for the Parvo virus?

01:30:08.703 --> 01:30:09.803
How many?

01:30:09.805 --> 01:30:12.806
None.

01:30:12.808 --> 01:30:14.975
Hm... how many died while they
were under your care?

01:30:14.977 --> 01:30:18.345
[Landon] Objection! Your Honor,
Miss McConnell is not
on trial here.

01:30:18.347 --> 01:30:20.614
This question is directly
relevant to the credibility

01:30:20.616 --> 01:30:23.550
of the witness's claim that
she's an expert on animal care.

01:30:23.552 --> 01:30:26.620
Overruled. Please answer
that question, Miss McConnell.

01:30:26.622 --> 01:30:30.223
I will repeat, how many of Mr.
Holloway's dogs died

01:30:30.225 --> 01:30:34.027
while in your care?
How many?

01:30:34.029 --> 01:30:35.629
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:30:35.631 --> 01:30:37.631
You're under oath,
Miss McConnell!

01:30:37.633 --> 01:30:41.601
I'll do the math for you:
29 dogs died, 29!

01:30:41.603 --> 01:30:44.204
- Objection!
- Overruled.

01:30:47.942 --> 01:30:51.545
Quiet! Order! Order!

01:30:54.148 --> 01:30:57.350
We have autopsy reports here
of all 29 dogs,

01:30:57.352 --> 01:31:02.022
most of whom contracted
and died of the Parvo
virus while under your care.

01:31:02.024 --> 01:31:05.425
It's extremely common
and very contagious!

01:31:05.427 --> 01:31:08.728
Did you vaccinate the dogs
for Parvo?

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:15.769
No, there wasn't time and we
didn't have the resources.

01:31:15.771 --> 01:31:17.537
- Why?
- We were overwhelmed.

01:31:17.539 --> 01:31:19.406
Promises are made
and then broken.

01:31:19.408 --> 01:31:21.908
- It happens all the time--
- By who?

01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:24.010
Who made these promises?

01:31:28.916 --> 01:31:32.452
[sighs] The UAPA.

01:31:32.454 --> 01:31:34.421
[crowd murmuring]

01:31:35.790 --> 01:31:37.057
Quiet.

01:31:37.059 --> 01:31:40.026
Do you believe that dog
breeding should be allowed?

01:31:40.028 --> 01:31:41.328
Absolutely not!

01:31:41.330 --> 01:31:43.263
That's what this
was about, wasn't it?

01:31:43.265 --> 01:31:45.732
To shut my client
down by any means possible,

01:31:45.734 --> 01:31:47.667
as dictated to you
by the UAPA,

01:31:47.669 --> 01:31:50.170
even if it meant committing
the same crime that you're
accusing him of?

01:31:50.172 --> 01:31:51.838
Objection!
Your Honor, objection!

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:53.273
Sustained.

01:31:53.275 --> 01:31:57.944
Your Honor, permission to
approach the bench.

01:31:57.946 --> 01:32:00.881
I would like to submit People's
Exhibit D into evidence.

01:32:00.883 --> 01:32:04.484
Your Honor, the state has no
knowledge of any new evidence.

01:32:04.486 --> 01:32:06.753
Permission granted.

01:32:06.755 --> 01:32:08.989
You're gonna love this.

01:32:15.530 --> 01:32:19.466
The organization is the only
thing that matters, Sara.

01:32:19.468 --> 01:32:22.235
I know, I know and I guess
what I mean is...

01:32:22.237 --> 01:32:24.237
that makes sense to me now.

01:32:24.239 --> 01:32:27.741
We can't be in the business of
finding a home for every stray.

01:32:27.743 --> 01:32:30.544
Yeah, we attack from the top.
At the root cause.

01:32:30.546 --> 01:32:33.346
And if animals are destroyed
along the way, then so be it.

01:32:33.348 --> 01:32:35.549
Yeah, we are focused
on the bigger picture.

01:32:35.551 --> 01:32:37.450
Our job is to
raise awareness.

01:32:37.452 --> 01:32:38.752
It's a numbers game.

01:32:38.754 --> 01:32:40.287
We can't throw away
money on animals

01:32:40.289 --> 01:32:41.821
that are never
gonna find a home.

01:32:41.823 --> 01:32:43.256
Right.

01:32:45.426 --> 01:32:47.761
Then let me ask you something.

01:32:47.763 --> 01:32:51.798
Why is it that we pretend
to care about actual animals?

01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:55.035
I mean, we beg for donations and
then basically trick people

01:32:55.037 --> 01:32:58.238
into thinking they're
really saving animals?

01:33:01.108 --> 01:33:02.943
I checked with accounting.

01:33:02.945 --> 01:33:06.813
You didn't give a single cent
to Jackie to care for the
Holloway dogs.

01:33:06.815 --> 01:33:12.786
Sara, we spend our resources
changing legislation.

01:33:12.788 --> 01:33:15.355
That helps millions of animals.

01:33:15.357 --> 01:33:17.958
It's where we can
make the most difference.

01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:21.828
We raised a hundred and sixty
million dollars last year.

01:33:21.830 --> 01:33:24.798
You have no idea how much
money it costs

01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:27.701
to get a bill passed
through the Senate.

01:33:27.703 --> 01:33:30.003
<i>[Sara] I also found this.</i>

01:33:30.005 --> 01:33:34.441
<i>The Holloway press release...</i>
<i>so what?</i>

01:33:34.443 --> 01:33:36.209
It's dated three days
before the raid.

01:33:36.211 --> 01:33:38.578
Three days before anybody
set foot on their property.

01:33:38.580 --> 01:33:41.081
We write early drafts
all the time.

01:33:41.083 --> 01:33:43.617
Yeah, but this draft is almost
identical to what was released.

01:33:43.619 --> 01:33:46.886
<i>"Dogs living in their own</i>
<i>feces, looking skittish,</i>
<i>underfed."</i>

01:33:46.888 --> 01:33:50.624
<i>If any of that were true,</i>
<i>I would have reported it</i>
<i>to you and you know it!</i>

01:33:50.626 --> 01:33:52.726
<i>But no, you were going</i>
<i>in no matter what.</i>

01:33:52.728 --> 01:33:56.796
<i>Oh... you are free</i>
<i>to leave any time.</i>

01:33:56.798 --> 01:33:59.566
Oh, I'm not done.
This is the best part.

01:33:59.568 --> 01:34:02.636
See, I can prove that
you ordered a shelter employee

01:34:02.638 --> 01:34:05.238
<i>to get rid of dogs you didn't</i>
<i>provide care for.</i>

01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:08.308
<i>You let the Holloway dogs die</i>
<i>and then made them disappear.</i>

01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:12.245
<i>Man, I wonder how that'd go</i>
<i>over at your next fundraiser?</i>

01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:14.881
Hmm.

01:34:18.185 --> 01:34:19.719
Well played.

01:34:19.721 --> 01:34:23.690
There's the real Sara
underneath your cutesy smile.

01:34:25.593 --> 01:34:28.561
Okay. Forget everything
you know,

01:34:28.563 --> 01:34:32.198
<i>and you'll get your</i>
<i>big promotion, a corner office,</i>

01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:35.135
<i>an expense account,</i>
<i>you name it.</i>

01:34:35.137 --> 01:34:37.604
Make all this disappear.

01:34:37.606 --> 01:34:39.839
<i>[Sara] You would love that,</i>
<i>wouldn't you?</i>

01:34:39.841 --> 01:34:44.310
<i>But see then that would</i>
<i>make me exactly like you.</i>

01:34:44.312 --> 01:34:47.647
I will never be like you.

01:34:49.383 --> 01:34:51.551
We are done here.

01:35:02.063 --> 01:35:05.732
Brad? I think we have a problem.

01:35:05.734 --> 01:35:07.634
Can you take this
to accounting and find out

01:35:07.636 --> 01:35:09.736
who has been
talking to Sara Gold?

01:35:09.738 --> 01:35:10.870
Of course.

01:35:10.872 --> 01:35:12.005
And close the door
on your way out.

01:35:12.007 --> 01:35:13.940
- No problem.
- Thank you.

01:35:13.942 --> 01:35:18.478
Oh, it's the Holloway case.
She's not letting it go.

01:35:25.419 --> 01:35:28.555
We find the defendant,
Daniel Holloway,

01:35:28.557 --> 01:35:30.824
- not guilty, on all counts.
- [gasping]

01:35:31.959 --> 01:35:33.993
[Liz sobbing]

01:35:56.717 --> 01:35:58.284
[Dan] Come here.

01:36:20.941 --> 01:36:22.275
Thank you.

01:36:22.277 --> 01:36:24.477
It's the least I could do.

01:36:31.619 --> 01:36:33.386
I'm so sorry.

01:36:49.003 --> 01:36:50.403
Mr. Holloway.

01:36:50.405 --> 01:36:52.405
Mr. Holloway, Mike Ames,
KOL-TV.

01:36:52.407 --> 01:36:53.940
How do you feel
about the verdict?

01:36:56.677 --> 01:37:00.146
Very grateful that
the Holloway family name
has finally been cleared.

01:37:00.148 --> 01:37:03.650
And that justice
has been served.

01:37:03.652 --> 01:37:06.386
- I'm very tired.
- Let's go home, Daddy.

01:37:07.621 --> 01:37:09.155
Let's go home.

01:37:42.690 --> 01:37:44.724
Come here, come on.

01:37:45.793 --> 01:37:48.394
Good boy,
that's a good boy.

01:37:48.396 --> 01:37:51.564
[laughing] Good boy.

01:37:54.702 --> 01:37:56.369
[laughing] Good boy.

01:37:56.371 --> 01:37:59.739
That's a good boy.
Yes, we did it.

01:38:04.578 --> 01:38:06.980
- [barking]
- Heel, boy. Come on, heel.
