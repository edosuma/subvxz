WEBVTT

00:52.218 --> 00:54.137
Why is it so difficult for you?

00:57.766 --> 00:58.975
You see,

01:00.602 --> 01:02.270
I really like you.

01:04.731 --> 01:06.149
So I want to know…

01:08.151 --> 01:10.445
what kind of life you've lived

01:11.696 --> 01:13.490
and what's on your mind.

01:23.291 --> 01:26.586
I've been dreaming of the day

01:27.587 --> 01:29.631
you and I become family.

01:40.099 --> 01:41.810
Say something. Anything.

01:50.860 --> 01:51.861
I'm sorry.

01:57.617 --> 01:59.953
Why are you turning into someone else?

02:02.747 --> 02:04.207
Why are you drifting away?

02:07.961 --> 02:09.587
Why are you becoming a stranger?

02:15.426 --> 02:17.637
I don't know who you are anymore.

02:19.764 --> 02:21.099
I don't understand you.

02:24.936 --> 02:25.937
Me neither.

02:34.070 --> 02:35.530
I don't know either.

03:38.927 --> 03:40.011
Dr. Yoon!

03:41.638 --> 03:44.224
I was actually on my way to your place.

03:44.307 --> 03:45.683
What are you doing here?

03:49.437 --> 03:51.981
Dr. Yoon, are you crying?

03:52.065 --> 03:54.567
What's the matter? Is something up?

03:54.651 --> 03:57.070
It's just that I forgot to pay my rent.

03:57.612 --> 04:00.448
What? That's not a big deal.

04:01.115 --> 04:04.244
I'm sorry. I'll make sure
to wire it to you today.

04:04.911 --> 04:07.455
One might think I'm a mean landlady.

04:07.538 --> 04:11.334
Dr. Yoon, it's all right. It really is.

04:23.054 --> 04:26.224
I must be going nuts.
The tears just keep coming out.

04:28.726 --> 04:30.937
Have you had breakfast?

04:37.735 --> 04:38.611
EPISODE 14

04:38.695 --> 04:40.822
-Dr. Yoon.
-Oh, right.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.203
It's seaweed soup with sea urchin.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.914
I made it for Yun-gyeong,
but you get to have some.

04:49.998 --> 04:53.501
Isn't this what you had
on your first day in Gongjin?

04:55.253 --> 04:57.130
I really enjoyed it that day.

04:58.214 --> 05:01.217
I'll enjoy it today as well. Thank you.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.677
Don't mention it.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.388
Giving birth sure is exhausting,

05:05.471 --> 05:08.558
but I'm sure it was no easy task
delivering the baby.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.768
Go ahead and dig in.

05:10.852 --> 05:11.853
Okay.

05:22.447 --> 05:23.323
It's good.

05:24.699 --> 05:29.579
Come to think of it, haven't you been here
for about four or five months now?

05:30.788 --> 05:31.622
Yes.

05:32.290 --> 05:35.168
Time sure flies,
and it's scary how people connect.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.837
Who would've thought

05:37.920 --> 05:41.382
you'd open a dental clinic here
and date Chief Hong of all people?

05:46.763 --> 05:49.640
Did something happen
between you and Du-sik?

05:54.604 --> 05:56.314
You don't have to tell me.

05:57.774 --> 06:00.860
I just thought
maybe I could be of any help.

06:01.569 --> 06:05.573
You know, unlike Nam-suk,
I'm one to be tight-lipped.

06:09.494 --> 06:10.411
Ms. Yeo.

06:12.538 --> 06:13.873
Do you know

06:14.582 --> 06:18.836
why he quit his job
and came back to Gongjin?

06:18.920 --> 06:23.257
Oh, that. That's something
I don't know much about.

06:23.758 --> 06:26.469
The same goes for most people in town.

06:27.011 --> 06:29.514
That's why there are
all sorts of rumors about it.

06:30.181 --> 06:32.934
After he went to college
and served in the military,

06:33.017 --> 06:35.770
he got busy and rarely had time to visit.

06:35.853 --> 06:37.105
But

06:38.272 --> 06:40.942
I do remember how he was
on the first day back.

06:49.033 --> 06:50.785
<i>He was a wreck.</i>

06:58.126 --> 07:01.546
<i>He wasn't the man we used to know.</i>

07:01.629 --> 07:05.299
<i>I guess you can say
that he held a blank expression.</i>

07:06.175 --> 07:08.594
<i>Like someone who had let go of everything.</i>

07:11.806 --> 07:13.474
<i>So no one could ask him.</i>

07:14.100 --> 07:17.645
We just all assumed
that he'd gone through something.

07:18.646 --> 07:22.316
Has he not told you about that either?

07:24.068 --> 07:25.069
No.

07:26.654 --> 07:30.366
He still hasn't opened up to me.

07:30.867 --> 07:33.411
No, you're wrong about that.

07:34.412 --> 07:36.539
Chief Hong… No.

07:37.623 --> 07:41.127
I've never seen Du-sik
happier than he is these days.

07:41.794 --> 07:43.796
-Really?
-Of course.

07:44.964 --> 07:49.302
Dr. Yoon, what may be easy for one person

07:49.385 --> 07:52.722
can be something difficult for another.

07:54.432 --> 07:57.477
Ever since he was a kid, he was so mature.

07:58.102 --> 08:00.438
He only learned how to hold himself back,

08:01.022 --> 08:03.024
so he doesn't know
how to open up to people.

08:04.317 --> 08:09.238
For a long time, he hasn't had anyone
that he could share his pain with.

08:13.326 --> 08:18.331
I believe that you can be his rock,
someone he opens up to.

08:22.168 --> 08:25.046
Going through both marriage and divorce

08:25.630 --> 08:27.215
has enlightened me.

08:27.298 --> 08:29.550
I regret being so impatient.

08:30.551 --> 08:34.472
I wish I'd told him
what I was really feeling for once.

08:52.740 --> 08:53.866
MS. DENTIST

09:15.429 --> 09:16.556
Hello?

09:16.639 --> 09:20.518
<i>Chief Hong, where are you?
You said you'd come and help out today.</i>

09:20.601 --> 09:22.103
Right. I did.

09:23.145 --> 09:25.022
Sorry about that. I'll be right over.

09:25.606 --> 09:26.482
Got it.

10:07.523 --> 10:08.524
Seon-a.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.901
-Ha-rang!
-Uncle Seong-hyeon!

10:14.030 --> 10:16.949
-Gosh, how long has it been?
-Have you been well?

10:17.033 --> 10:18.451
Ha-rang's gotten so big.

10:18.534 --> 10:21.162
He couldn't wait to see you, you know.

10:22.913 --> 10:24.290
-Ha-rang.
-Yes?

10:24.373 --> 10:26.125
"Yes," was it?

10:26.834 --> 10:28.961
You're loving it, aren't you?

10:29.795 --> 10:31.505
Is Auntie well?

10:31.589 --> 10:34.342
She is. You won't believe what she said.

10:34.425 --> 10:36.469
When she found out
I was coming to see you,

10:36.552 --> 10:40.431
she asked me to get DOS' autographs.
She doesn't even know who they are.

10:41.015 --> 10:42.683
How was the traffic?

10:42.767 --> 10:44.310
It's not the traffic

10:44.393 --> 10:47.146
but traveling with a kid
that's the hassle.

10:47.229 --> 10:50.691
He was adamant about
not sitting in his car seat.

10:50.775 --> 10:52.985
I know he's my kid, but gosh.

10:53.611 --> 10:56.489
Seon-a, just let him do whatever he wants.

10:56.572 --> 10:59.158
Don't even think of winning
against this adorable being.

10:59.241 --> 11:02.703
You think so? Then why don't you do
a babysitting variety show next?

11:02.787 --> 11:05.039
One with about 15 kids.

11:05.122 --> 11:07.958
Fine, I apologize.
Forgive me for what I said.

11:08.042 --> 11:11.003
Yes, and there's another thing
you should ask for forgiveness for.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.755
You didn't come to my wedding.

11:12.838 --> 11:15.007
It's been years,
and you still bring it up?

11:15.091 --> 11:18.094
I was an assistant director back then
and was in another country

11:18.177 --> 11:20.638
pulling all-nighters to shoot a show.

11:20.721 --> 11:23.766
You chose your career
over my wedding then, and thanks to that,

11:23.849 --> 11:25.768
you've become a star director.

11:25.851 --> 11:27.686
I take credit for your success.

11:27.770 --> 11:31.607
Jeez. You sure have gotten
more brazen over the years.

11:31.690 --> 11:33.317
What? Is there something you need?

11:33.401 --> 11:36.112
Whatever it is, I won't decline.

11:39.490 --> 11:43.160
By the way, I didn't expect
you'd actually come here.

11:44.829 --> 11:47.498
I've been meaning to come by sometime.

11:48.165 --> 11:49.417
I heard a lot about it.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.377
Really? From whom?

11:51.460 --> 11:54.380
Someone I know. This is his hometown.

11:54.880 --> 11:58.342
Really? That's interesting.
So how do you like it?

12:01.637 --> 12:02.763
Just like I've heard.

12:04.682 --> 12:05.683
It's nice.

12:10.771 --> 12:13.023
Is it good? Take your time.

12:30.416 --> 12:31.959
How long was I asleep?

12:35.713 --> 12:39.800
<i>Ms. Yoon, I'm leaving
without waking you up. Enjoy your sleep.</i>

12:43.429 --> 12:45.514
MISSED CALL: CHIEF HONG

12:48.225 --> 12:50.519
MISSED CALL: CHIEF HONG

12:50.603 --> 12:51.770
CHIEF HONG

13:02.072 --> 13:03.240
Hello? Hye-jin?

13:04.033 --> 13:05.618
<i>I see you called.</i>

13:05.701 --> 13:06.702
Yes.

13:08.162 --> 13:10.122
I'm sorry I didn't stop you when you left.

13:11.457 --> 13:13.876
<i>We should meet. Where are you?
I'll be right there.</i>

13:13.959 --> 13:16.962
No, I'd rather not see you.

13:18.631 --> 13:19.548
What?

13:20.633 --> 13:23.928
What if I see you? I know all you'll say

13:24.845 --> 13:26.889
is that you're sorry.

13:27.681 --> 13:29.308
Like you did just now.

13:30.309 --> 13:31.644
I think

13:32.603 --> 13:34.980
we need to have some time apart.

13:37.024 --> 13:40.194
<i>Not in a way people do as a formality
before breaking up.</i>

13:41.987 --> 13:44.365
I don't want to break up with you.

13:45.699 --> 13:46.825
Then why…

13:48.702 --> 13:50.788
It just seems to me you need some time.

13:52.581 --> 13:56.877
Time that will finally stop you
from being sorry.

13:58.128 --> 14:02.758
Time you'll need
to finally be honest with me.

14:05.636 --> 14:07.596
<i>Because we can't go on like this.</i>

14:09.557 --> 14:14.395
Let's take our time
and carefully think this through.

14:15.646 --> 14:17.773
About where we should go from here

14:18.732 --> 14:20.526
and what we both want.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.445
<i>You get what I mean, right?</i>

14:24.280 --> 14:25.447
I do.

14:27.032 --> 14:28.075
I'll hang up then.

14:43.340 --> 14:46.552
YOON DENTAL CLINIC

14:51.015 --> 14:53.225
What's this?

14:54.018 --> 14:55.394
I thought you'd look

14:55.978 --> 14:59.982
pretty, cute, and lovely in it,
so I bought it for you.

15:00.065 --> 15:02.568
-Is it clothes?
-Yes.

15:02.651 --> 15:05.946
You really didn't have to.
I have a lot to wear.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.948
But I thought it'd look perfect on you.

15:08.032 --> 15:08.949
I see.

15:10.117 --> 15:12.703
Anyway, I have to get going.
I just stopped by.

15:12.786 --> 15:16.248
Thank you for this.
I'll make sure to cherish it.

15:16.332 --> 15:17.207
Sure.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.338
I'll call you later.

15:29.428 --> 15:30.846
Good for you, Mi-seon.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.432
You're in the honeymoon phase.

15:34.099 --> 15:35.267
What?

15:36.143 --> 15:39.146
Why do you sound
like you're already in a rut?

15:39.229 --> 15:41.440
Are things still off
between you and Chief Hong?

15:42.983 --> 15:46.987
I get the feeling that it'll take
quite a while to patch things up.

15:48.989 --> 15:50.324
No?

15:51.241 --> 15:52.743
Hello.

15:52.826 --> 15:53.953
Gosh, Ms. Yu.

15:54.036 --> 15:56.497
-Hello.
-Hello.

15:57.081 --> 16:02.211
As you can see, your wisdom tooth
is impacted close to your jaw.

16:02.294 --> 16:03.504
Wisdom tooth?

16:04.213 --> 16:08.550
I never had one,
so I thought I was born not to have any.

16:08.634 --> 16:14.473
They mostly emerge
in one's teens and early 20s.

16:15.933 --> 16:18.852
Technically, they're third molars

16:19.645 --> 16:23.357
but also known as wisdom teeth since
they emerge when you get wiser about love.

16:24.483 --> 16:25.567
I see.

16:26.944 --> 16:29.905
It stayed hidden for long
without showing any symptoms.

16:35.661 --> 16:39.415
Hwa-jeong, people don't color
their fingernails with balsam these days.

16:39.498 --> 16:41.041
Most people use manicure.

16:41.125 --> 16:44.628
But cooks shouldn't since
it might chip and fall into the food.

16:44.712 --> 16:46.046
I see.

16:46.130 --> 16:47.923
Besides, I prefer balsam anyway.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.509
Why? Wait, I know.

16:51.093 --> 16:52.845
Because of the saying
that love will come true

16:52.928 --> 16:54.513
if the color lasts until first snowfall?

16:54.596 --> 16:56.056
As if I'd believe such nonsense.

16:57.891 --> 16:59.059
Do you want to try?

16:59.977 --> 17:01.895
Probably not. It's dowdy, isn't it?

17:04.940 --> 17:05.941
I want to try it too.

17:12.948 --> 17:13.782
Cho-hui.

17:23.459 --> 17:25.085
Are you out of your mind?

17:26.086 --> 17:28.756
-Your brother will kill you.
-Why are you here?

17:29.715 --> 17:31.216
To nag at me?

17:31.884 --> 17:35.345
You only took the thick duvet,
so I brought you summer sheets.

17:35.429 --> 17:38.474
I wanted to see how you were doing.

17:39.433 --> 17:40.642
But here you go again!

17:40.726 --> 17:43.062
What? I didn't do anything wrong.

17:43.145 --> 17:43.979
Seriously?

17:44.063 --> 17:47.191
I'm your mother.
I can tell by the look in your eyes.

17:48.192 --> 17:49.985
Denying it won't work.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.112
You can't fool me.

17:53.030 --> 17:58.368
Cho-hui, please. Get a grip on yourself.
What's wrong with you?

17:59.203 --> 18:03.832
If you keep this up, your brother will
lock you up in a mental institution.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.334
Mom!

18:06.126 --> 18:08.670
I'm not crazy. I'm perfectly fine.

18:09.713 --> 18:13.050
How is liking someone an illness?

18:13.133 --> 18:14.343
You're wrong.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.471
This is all because I raised you wrong.

18:18.138 --> 18:20.849
-It's all my fault!
-Mom.

18:23.060 --> 18:26.063
It's not your fault. It isn't.

18:26.688 --> 18:28.357
It's not my fault either.

18:29.024 --> 18:32.569
No, Cho-hui.
This isn't how you should live your life.

18:32.653 --> 18:35.239
Cho-hui, no.

18:38.408 --> 18:39.993
Please, Cho-hui.

18:43.914 --> 18:44.748
Ms. Yu?

18:46.166 --> 18:47.543
Sorry about that.

18:48.043 --> 18:50.254
I only came in
because my molar hurt though.

18:50.337 --> 18:52.464
That's actually because

18:52.548 --> 18:56.051
the impacted tooth is
pressing against the molar's roots.

18:56.135 --> 18:59.263
There's a chance
that the roots will also be affected,

18:59.346 --> 19:01.140
so the tooth should be extracted.

19:02.015 --> 19:03.892
Is that the only way?

19:03.976 --> 19:05.644
Many fear the procedure,

19:06.228 --> 19:09.982
but I recommend
that you bravely dig it out

19:10.065 --> 19:12.818
rather than keep your pain hidden.

19:12.901 --> 19:14.027
I see.

19:42.723 --> 19:44.641
YOON HYE-JIN

21:00.592 --> 21:01.677
Mi-seon.

21:04.137 --> 21:06.014
-How do I look?
-Absolutely gorgeous.

21:08.725 --> 21:11.812
-Let's see.
-What are you doing? Don't.

21:12.813 --> 21:14.773
Does Officer Choi know this brand?

21:15.649 --> 21:17.109
How trendy of him.

21:17.192 --> 21:20.612
I bet he looked it up online.
He's been doing it nonstop these days.

21:21.446 --> 21:22.864
Is this brand expensive?

21:23.573 --> 21:26.201
Yes, it is quite expensive.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.411
Really?

21:28.078 --> 21:31.081
Eun-cheol's salary probably isn't much.
I feel bad.

21:33.208 --> 21:36.336
These flowers look like you, so…

21:37.421 --> 21:38.672
Oh, my.

21:38.755 --> 21:42.509
I can't tell you apart from the flowers.

21:47.389 --> 21:49.016
I don't want you to run away,

21:50.434 --> 21:51.768
so pay me 100 won.

21:57.941 --> 22:03.363
I'd appreciate it
if you wore it every day.

22:16.585 --> 22:17.586
What's this?

22:18.086 --> 22:19.129
It's a purse.

22:19.212 --> 22:22.299
I thought it'd suit you.

22:23.050 --> 22:24.551
I won't accept this.

22:24.634 --> 22:25.635
Sorry?

22:26.803 --> 22:27.679
Why not?

22:27.763 --> 22:31.349
Eun-cheol, this is wrong.

22:31.433 --> 22:32.893
This is too much.

22:33.727 --> 22:34.895
Mi-seon,

22:35.854 --> 22:37.355
am I making you uncomfortable?

22:37.439 --> 22:39.483
No, it's not like that.

22:40.108 --> 22:43.153
You're giving me too many gifts.

22:43.236 --> 22:46.364
You give me a gift every day,
even when it's not a special day.

22:46.448 --> 22:47.866
But every day is special.

22:49.409 --> 22:52.079
Every day with you…

22:53.121 --> 22:54.414
is special to me.

22:54.915 --> 22:59.586
Every day I spend with you
is special to me too.

22:59.669 --> 23:00.504
However,

23:01.004 --> 23:04.800
I mean it when I say
the thought is what counts.

23:09.262 --> 23:12.933
I understand. I'll hold back from now on.

23:21.149 --> 23:23.235
I'm sorry, but I need to make a call.

23:39.876 --> 23:41.336
Gosh.

23:43.588 --> 23:45.173
It sure is pretty.

23:45.674 --> 23:46.675
No way!

23:48.176 --> 23:51.596
This is a pricey one.
Isn't it from the new F/W collection?

23:51.680 --> 23:53.682
No way. It's gorgeous.

23:53.765 --> 23:57.185
How is it that you know
more about these things than I do?

23:57.269 --> 24:01.189
Because I'm the future stylist
of the globally acclaimed DOS.

24:02.399 --> 24:04.526
-I hope your dream will come true.
-Thanks.

24:08.196 --> 24:09.614
Can't I look at it some more?

24:09.698 --> 24:11.199
-No.
-Please.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.160
-Just a little more.
-No way.

24:13.243 --> 24:15.036
-Can't I look inside?
-No.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.164
-Please let me look.
-No.

24:17.247 --> 24:18.665
What's taking him so long?

24:20.500 --> 24:21.376
I'm afraid I can't.

24:22.919 --> 24:25.338
After all those favors I've done for you?

24:25.422 --> 24:26.965
I at least want five large ones.

24:28.842 --> 24:31.136
You know how dangerous it'll be
if we get caught.

24:32.095 --> 24:35.265
Okay. I'll see you at 9 p.m.
at the back of the market.

24:35.932 --> 24:36.892
Sure.

24:40.270 --> 24:41.313
Oh, no.

24:41.813 --> 24:44.191
Is he taking bribes to pay for my gifts?

24:44.274 --> 24:47.277
No wonder. Where else
could he have gotten the money?

24:47.360 --> 24:50.739
You've got to be kidding me. What do I do?

24:54.409 --> 24:57.495
Mi-seon, why did you come down?

24:57.579 --> 25:00.582
Oh. Well…

25:00.665 --> 25:04.836
Eun-cheol, let's catch
a late-night movie today.

25:05.629 --> 25:07.672
-How does 9 p.m. sound?
-Well, I…

25:10.300 --> 25:11.927
I'm sorry, but not today.

25:12.010 --> 25:16.181
You see, I'm on duty tonight.

25:16.264 --> 25:17.974
Tomorrow. How about tomorrow?

25:18.058 --> 25:20.185
Right. Okay.

25:20.268 --> 25:21.269
Okay.

25:34.032 --> 25:35.033
Cho-hui.

25:40.330 --> 25:43.792
I asked you to help me with the cleaning…

25:46.878 --> 25:51.424
to say that I'm sorry about
putting you in a tight spot last time.

25:51.508 --> 25:53.134
I shouldn't have said it.

25:53.218 --> 25:56.513
It's all in the past now,
so please don't let it bother you.

25:56.596 --> 25:57.555
Sure.

25:58.223 --> 25:59.224
Actually,

26:00.433 --> 26:02.894
there's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

26:02.978 --> 26:05.397
What? What is it?

26:05.480 --> 26:07.399
When I came back to Gongjin,

26:07.482 --> 26:10.110
I was surprised to hear…

26:11.278 --> 26:12.904
about your divorce.

26:14.531 --> 26:17.409
I'm utterly ashamed.
It's actually all my fault.

26:17.492 --> 26:20.245
I thought you two
would still be happily married.

26:20.996 --> 26:22.163
In harmony,

26:23.873 --> 26:26.459
trading fish eyes for roe.

26:28.837 --> 26:29.754
<i>Enjoy.</i>

26:29.838 --> 26:30.964
Thank you.

26:31.881 --> 26:36.052
So Cho-hui gets the middle slice.

26:36.970 --> 26:37.846
Thank you.

26:37.929 --> 26:40.098
And Hwa-jeong gets… There you go.

26:40.181 --> 26:43.518
Yeong-guk, she should get
a good slice as well.

26:43.601 --> 26:45.353
-Hwa-jeong, take mine.
-It's fine.

26:46.813 --> 26:48.148
Hwa-jeong!

26:48.231 --> 26:50.317
She loves fish eyes.

26:50.400 --> 26:53.278
God, I can't even bear to look at them.

26:53.361 --> 26:55.322
Hey. I'll take your eyes too.

26:58.950 --> 27:02.120
Eat your own eyes. You can't have mine.

27:02.203 --> 27:04.080
Don't be so dramatic.

27:04.706 --> 27:06.124
Trade them for the roe then.

27:06.207 --> 27:07.751
You don't eat roe?

27:07.834 --> 27:09.169
It's too dry for me.

27:09.252 --> 27:13.131
Fish eyes are tasty and crunchy.
They're definitely better.

27:13.214 --> 27:16.051
You and that grotesque taste of yours.

27:16.134 --> 27:17.719
I appreciate the satisfying deal.

27:24.392 --> 27:25.894
<i>You probably don't know this,</i>

27:27.062 --> 27:30.315
<i>but I envied the relationship you two had.</i>

27:30.398 --> 27:31.316
<i>What?</i>

27:33.068 --> 27:35.570
<i>This is what I thought
every time I saw you two.</i>

27:36.571 --> 27:41.201
<i>"I'd never grow lonely if I had
someone like that."</i>

27:44.871 --> 27:46.164
I had no idea back then.

27:47.707 --> 27:49.209
I took it for granted,

27:50.877 --> 27:52.295
so I didn't realize

27:53.755 --> 27:55.757
how precious and rare it was.

27:58.635 --> 28:00.053
It's funny, isn't it?

28:01.012 --> 28:04.432
You don't realize your own feelings
until they're seen from a distance.

28:07.936 --> 28:09.270
Don't

28:09.938 --> 28:11.648
lose Hwa-jeong twice.

28:12.732 --> 28:15.693
I truly hope
that you two become happy together.

28:18.446 --> 28:22.283
I hurt her too badly
and I'm too ashamed of myself.

28:22.367 --> 28:23.410
Yeong-guk,

28:24.369 --> 28:28.498
I'm sure what she wants to hear from you
isn't an apology.

28:35.004 --> 28:37.590
I'm having my wisdom tooth
extracted next week.

28:37.674 --> 28:40.510
I'm scared
since people say it hurts a lot,

28:41.886 --> 28:43.763
but I'll muster up the courage for it.

28:45.014 --> 28:49.561
So you should muster up
a little bit of courage too.

28:56.025 --> 28:57.235
Thanks, Cho-hui.

29:23.678 --> 29:24.721
Here, let me.

29:24.804 --> 29:25.847
No, I'm good.

29:28.725 --> 29:32.145
Mi-seon's going out on a date,
so I came by myself.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.775
But don't forget
that we're still on a break.

29:41.780 --> 29:45.366
Chief Hong, you still have
nothing to say to me.

30:23.238 --> 30:25.031
It should be close to 9 p.m.

30:25.782 --> 30:26.908
Why can't I see a thing?

30:27.408 --> 30:29.244
Damn sunglasses.

30:38.711 --> 30:40.713
-My gosh.
-Will you check the merchandise?

30:40.797 --> 30:42.757
Come on. As if I'd be that cold.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.884
-This isn't our first rodeo.
-What's in that?

30:45.385 --> 30:46.261
Take the money first.

30:49.138 --> 30:50.014
It's all there.

30:51.975 --> 30:53.560
-I'll now open this.
-No.

30:54.727 --> 30:57.689
Eun-cheol, no. Don't!

30:57.772 --> 30:58.773
You can't!

30:58.857 --> 31:01.693
-Eun-cheol, you just can't.
-What the hell?

31:01.776 --> 31:03.862
-What are you doing?
-How are you here?

31:03.945 --> 31:06.072
Eun-cheol, you can't.

31:06.155 --> 31:10.243
Are you selling illegal firearms?
You're a police officer.

31:10.326 --> 31:12.161
It's not like that. Mi-seon, this is--

31:12.245 --> 31:14.455
-It's not that.
-Did you just shoot me?

31:14.539 --> 31:15.832
-Of course not.
-You shot me!

31:15.915 --> 31:19.460
Mi-seon, it's only a toy.
It can't shoot live rounds.

31:19.544 --> 31:20.837
-It can't?
-No.

31:20.920 --> 31:22.005
-It's a toy?
-Yes.

31:22.505 --> 31:24.883
-Is that a toy?
-Yes, it is.

31:24.966 --> 31:27.510
Why on earth did you bring
a toy gun out here?

31:27.594 --> 31:30.263
I'm selling it to him. Used goods.

31:30.889 --> 31:31.973
What?

31:32.056 --> 31:34.726
I've been selling items in my collection.

31:34.809 --> 31:36.311
I'm a military-junkie, you see.

31:37.186 --> 31:38.521
I'm a frequent buyer.

31:41.190 --> 31:42.317
He is.

31:45.111 --> 31:46.112
My gosh.

31:47.906 --> 31:50.408
It looks pretty real, doesn't it?

31:52.911 --> 31:55.163
I apologize for alarming you.

31:57.248 --> 31:59.208
Why did you lie to me?

32:00.126 --> 32:02.378
You could've been honest from the start.

32:03.129 --> 32:04.589
I was embarrassed.

32:05.840 --> 32:08.968
I want to give you everything,

32:09.636 --> 32:11.262
but I'm not that well-off.

32:11.971 --> 32:14.891
I'm not saying that I'm totally poor.

32:15.725 --> 32:18.770
I save about 70 percent of what I earn.

32:19.687 --> 32:21.773
I have insurance
that covers hospital expenses.

32:22.815 --> 32:25.818
And I even have
a housing subscription deposit account.

32:28.029 --> 32:28.863
Same here.

32:30.615 --> 32:31.491
Sorry?

32:32.116 --> 32:33.618
I have all of those as well.

32:34.786 --> 32:37.330
I'm older than you

32:37.872 --> 32:39.916
and have had a longer career.

32:41.584 --> 32:43.878
I have an installment saving
that has matured

32:43.962 --> 32:45.713
and also a CMA account.

32:47.173 --> 32:49.509
Right, I see.

32:51.761 --> 32:52.762
Eun-cheol.

32:53.721 --> 32:56.182
Do you know the song that goes,

32:56.265 --> 32:59.519
"write love with a pencil"?

33:00.395 --> 33:01.437
No, I don't.

33:02.105 --> 33:05.108
Well… Come to think of it,

33:06.025 --> 33:07.610
you were born in the 90s.

33:08.695 --> 33:10.863
Anyway, there's a song like that.

33:12.281 --> 33:13.574
Like that song,

33:13.658 --> 33:18.121
rather than in fonts
that seem flimsy and silly,

33:18.663 --> 33:20.164
we'll write our love in cursive.

33:20.707 --> 33:21.958
What?

33:22.834 --> 33:27.088
I'm saying we should date seriously
with thoughts of marriage.

33:27.171 --> 33:28.464
Mi-seon.

33:30.717 --> 33:33.011
That has always been my intention.

33:44.647 --> 33:47.525
And I may be jumping the gun here,

33:48.026 --> 33:52.113
but we should stick to two kids
and raise them well.

33:52.196 --> 33:55.366
"Procreating without planning
will condemn you to poverty."

33:59.078 --> 34:00.663
Don't you know that one either?

34:01.414 --> 34:05.418
It was the birth control policy
carried out by the government in the 60s.

34:05.501 --> 34:09.005
I don't know. There's only one thing
on my mind right now.

34:11.007 --> 34:12.008
What's that?

34:13.468 --> 34:14.469
Today,

34:16.721 --> 34:18.681
-I'm skipping a few bases.
-What?

34:34.030 --> 34:36.908
Why has it been
so damn hard to reach her today?

34:39.660 --> 34:40.703
What the heck?

34:42.121 --> 34:44.332
It's not like her to close up so early.

34:45.041 --> 34:47.085
Gosh. What on earth?

34:47.168 --> 34:49.545
HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

34:49.629 --> 34:50.505
What's going on?

34:54.634 --> 34:55.635
What…

35:02.975 --> 35:04.268
What are you doing

35:05.269 --> 35:06.562
all alone?

35:07.814 --> 35:08.731
What?

35:10.358 --> 35:12.860
Jeez. What's with you?

35:14.278 --> 35:16.864
Get yourself a glass
if you're going to sit.

35:16.948 --> 35:19.033
Jeez.

35:19.117 --> 35:22.578
Judging by your answer,
you're completely wasted.

35:24.413 --> 35:25.873
I don't believe this.

35:28.334 --> 35:31.796
Did you empty
the bottle on your own? Gosh.

35:34.841 --> 35:35.675
Goodness.

35:38.636 --> 35:41.139
I can't seem to hold my liquor
like I used to.

35:41.722 --> 35:43.015
Gosh.

35:43.599 --> 35:44.600
Jeez.

35:48.646 --> 35:49.897
That's good.

35:51.399 --> 35:53.359
If you needed a drinking buddy,

35:53.442 --> 35:56.070
you should've called.
What's with the pity party?

35:56.154 --> 35:56.988
Wait.

35:58.489 --> 36:00.283
Filling your own glass brings bad luck.

36:04.704 --> 36:05.997
What gives though?

36:06.497 --> 36:09.834
The rain, the snow,
not even a divorce stopped you

36:09.917 --> 36:11.502
from working until late.

36:11.586 --> 36:14.964
Tell me about it. I should've
closed up early on the day of my divorce.

36:15.047 --> 36:18.134
Why did I bother to work so hard?

36:18.217 --> 36:21.387
Just think that this break
is long overdue then.

36:23.264 --> 36:25.308
Your body recovers after resting,

36:25.391 --> 36:27.894
but your heart doesn't, I guess.

36:28.561 --> 36:31.147
The wound must've festered
or the heart must have rotted

36:32.106 --> 36:33.774
because I feel all mushy inside.

36:35.151 --> 36:36.152
You…

36:38.571 --> 36:40.781
still have feelings
for Yeong-guk, don't you?

36:43.618 --> 36:46.954
Why do you ask? So that
you can tell everyone if I tell you?

36:47.038 --> 36:49.040
Gosh. What do you take me for?

36:49.123 --> 36:51.375
I may not seem like it,
but I'm your friend.

36:53.044 --> 36:56.088
Also, I haven't forgotten about the time

36:56.172 --> 36:59.175
you helped me through my rough patch.

36:59.258 --> 37:01.969
Nam-suk, that's something
you should forget.

37:02.053 --> 37:03.721
Girl, please.

37:04.597 --> 37:07.266
I just can't understand you.

37:07.350 --> 37:10.978
Why is it that you feel so much regret?

37:11.812 --> 37:13.314
I just don't get it.

37:15.233 --> 37:18.653
Because Yeong-guk took care of me
when I was down.

37:21.989 --> 37:24.700
Back when my mom collapsed.

37:28.496 --> 37:30.539
<i>Life itself felt like a burden,</i>

37:31.415 --> 37:34.627
<i>and not a day went by
when I didn't want to run away.</i>

37:36.754 --> 37:39.882
<i>Then one day,
when I went to see my mom at the hospital…</i>

37:39.966 --> 37:41.801
I bet that's refreshing.

37:41.884 --> 37:43.719
-Right?
-<i>Yeong-guk was there.</i>

37:44.512 --> 37:47.515
-It's not too hot, is it?
-<i>My mom hadn't been able to shower,</i>

37:47.598 --> 37:51.102
<i>and he was there
wiping her with a damp cloth</i>

37:51.852 --> 37:53.312
<i>with a smile on his face.</i>

37:56.107 --> 37:59.777
<i>That brought a smile to my mom's face too.</i>

38:02.321 --> 38:06.534
<i>The pain she was suffering
had her frowning and crying all the time,</i>

38:06.617 --> 38:08.160
<i>but thanks to Yeong-guk,</i>

38:08.744 --> 38:12.039
<i>she was laughing like she used to
before she fell ill.</i>

38:14.125 --> 38:17.253
<i>And back then, not even I could smile
in my mother's presence.</i>

38:22.258 --> 38:26.345
Goodness. A good wash
brought your beauty back out.

38:27.013 --> 38:29.849
I bet that felt nice. Right?

38:30.766 --> 38:34.145
<i>From that day on,
he came to see my mom at the hospital</i>

38:34.812 --> 38:38.649
<i>every day after getting off work.</i>

38:40.234 --> 38:44.030
Being the sweetheart he is,
he probably did it out of pity.

38:44.113 --> 38:45.406
Jeez.

38:45.489 --> 38:47.700
And just like that,
I put a ring on his finger.

38:48.284 --> 38:52.580
I clung onto him
knowing that he didn't actually love me.

38:53.789 --> 38:57.418
But I guess I grew to expect more
over the years.

38:58.961 --> 39:01.505
I blame my own greed and low self-esteem.

39:01.589 --> 39:02.715
You…

39:04.008 --> 39:05.426
Stop putting him on a pedestal.

39:06.010 --> 39:09.764
He's not Jesus, Buddha, or a saint.

39:09.847 --> 39:11.515
He only did what he wanted to do.

39:11.599 --> 39:15.227
Don't you know by now that
he never does what he doesn't want to?

39:15.311 --> 39:17.938
He's timid but totally stubborn.

39:18.022 --> 39:19.940
Hasn't marriage taught you that about him?

39:20.691 --> 39:22.818
Forget it. It's all in the past now.

39:25.738 --> 39:30.326
By the way, Ms. Joo
offered to set me up on a blind date.

39:30.409 --> 39:31.619
Seriously?

39:32.870 --> 39:35.122
You've got to be kidding me.

39:36.332 --> 39:39.168
And Yeong-guk said
I should accept her offer.

39:39.251 --> 39:41.295
That crazy bastard.

39:41.379 --> 39:45.091
So I told him I would.

39:46.092 --> 39:47.968
Why say something you don't mean?

39:48.969 --> 39:50.846
For someone who claims to be smart…

39:54.475 --> 39:55.476
Yeo Hwa-jeong.

39:58.312 --> 39:59.313
Hwa-jeong?

40:01.524 --> 40:05.236
Gosh.

40:06.904 --> 40:09.115
<i>Yeong-guk, Hwa-jeong's drinking
at her restaurant</i>

40:09.198 --> 40:11.283
<i>with the guy
she went on a blind date with,</i>

40:11.367 --> 40:12.952
<i>and she's completely wasted.</i>

40:13.494 --> 40:15.287
They're drinking alone?

40:15.371 --> 40:16.956
Damn judicial scrivener.

40:17.039 --> 40:19.417
For the first time,
I might commit a crime tonight.

40:20.543 --> 40:24.088
Hwa-jeong! Damn that bastard.

40:24.171 --> 40:26.590
Where… Hwa-jeong?

40:34.473 --> 40:35.683
<i>I lied.</i>

40:35.766 --> 40:37.852
Nam-suk, damn you!

41:05.796 --> 41:07.173
What the hell?

41:08.924 --> 41:10.843
What is this? Am I dreaming?

41:10.926 --> 41:12.470
No, you're not.

41:14.930 --> 41:16.182
Why are you here?

41:19.643 --> 41:22.813
Jeez. My head's killing me.

41:24.315 --> 41:26.817
Don't make it worse, and just leave.

41:26.901 --> 41:29.278
I have something to tell you.

41:29.361 --> 41:31.739
-Don't.
-I have to.

41:31.822 --> 41:33.449
Whatever. Don't say it.

41:33.532 --> 41:34.825
Don't go on that blind date.

41:44.043 --> 41:46.712
Are you drunk?
Why are you talking gibberish?

41:46.795 --> 41:48.881
I know I don't have the right to say this,

41:49.882 --> 41:51.091
but don't do it.

41:51.759 --> 41:52.676
You lunatic.

41:53.177 --> 41:54.803
Yes, that's what I am.

41:57.306 --> 41:59.725
Since we've established that,
I'll say one more thing.

42:01.101 --> 42:02.102
Can…

42:03.812 --> 42:06.440
Can you forgive me just this once?

42:09.568 --> 42:11.111
I shot myself in the foot.

42:13.030 --> 42:14.740
I dug my own grave.

42:17.243 --> 42:18.786
What I did to you…

42:23.749 --> 42:25.084
It all came back to me.

42:29.797 --> 42:30.798
I'm sorry…

42:33.133 --> 42:34.051
for hurting you

42:35.386 --> 42:37.054
without realizing it.

42:41.100 --> 42:42.142
I know…

42:45.062 --> 42:48.440
I could apologize forever
and it still wouldn't be enough.

42:53.946 --> 42:57.074
So I was going to let you go
to atone for what I did.

42:57.992 --> 42:58.993
But…

43:02.413 --> 43:03.706
Damn it.

43:05.624 --> 43:07.459
But I don't think I can.

43:11.171 --> 43:14.842
We were together since we were young,

43:18.095 --> 43:19.179
so I took you…

43:20.681 --> 43:21.932
for granted.

43:24.602 --> 43:26.979
Only after I lost you

43:27.605 --> 43:29.648
was I able to realize…

43:30.941 --> 43:32.318
what you mean to me.

43:35.904 --> 43:37.323
I'm truly sorry, Hwa-jeong.

43:40.284 --> 43:41.285
Can…

43:44.705 --> 43:47.958
Can we start over from the beginning?

43:53.464 --> 43:55.090
I'm slower than average

43:57.343 --> 43:59.219
and a darn fool.

44:04.183 --> 44:06.185
So I was the last
to realize your feelings.

44:08.395 --> 44:09.396
Hey!

44:13.567 --> 44:15.069
You asshole.

44:17.196 --> 44:19.782
Who takes 15 years
to come to that realization?

44:19.865 --> 44:21.784
Just leave.

44:23.118 --> 44:25.746
Leave. Just go!

44:31.960 --> 44:36.256
I'm sorry, Hwa-jeong.
I'll make it up to you while by your side.

44:36.340 --> 44:39.218
I'll treat you right from now on.

44:47.267 --> 44:50.437
Hwa-jeong, I'll treat you right.

44:50.521 --> 44:55.692
HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

45:00.531 --> 45:01.615
So busy.

45:01.698 --> 45:02.699
Hello.

45:04.785 --> 45:06.120
-Do-ha!
-Hey.

45:06.203 --> 45:07.371
Where are you off to?

45:07.454 --> 45:09.373
To the mart in the city.

45:09.957 --> 45:12.376
Ms. Wang needs something,
so I'm getting the car.

45:12.459 --> 45:15.045
I see. I'll go. What do you need?

45:15.129 --> 45:18.298
No, it's fine.
I can't pass an errand on to my boss.

45:18.382 --> 45:20.676
Tell me before I change my mind.

45:24.638 --> 45:26.682
All right. Then…

45:27.266 --> 45:29.685
The pot and flipper
JUNE burned the other day.

45:30.519 --> 45:33.439
Pot and flipper.

45:34.273 --> 45:35.774
We're out of bottled water too.

45:35.858 --> 45:36.942
Bottled water.

45:37.025 --> 45:38.569
And eggs.

45:38.652 --> 45:39.736
Eggs.

45:39.820 --> 45:42.990
By the way, I heard that Chief Hong
and Dr. Yoon had a falling out.

45:43.073 --> 45:45.826
Chief Hong… What? Who said that?

45:45.909 --> 45:49.329
Mr. Choi at Chung-ho Hardware,
Mr. Oh Yoon,

45:49.413 --> 45:52.833
Ms. Cho at the Gongjin
Korean-Chinese Restaurant, and…

45:54.084 --> 45:55.169
Where are you off to?

45:55.752 --> 45:58.505
We're also out of
tissues and green onions! And ice cream!

46:02.301 --> 46:04.094
Knock, knock. Excuse me.

46:04.887 --> 46:06.346
What brings you by, Director Ji?

46:06.430 --> 46:09.391
Just to say hi. Why are you
sweeping a yard that's already clean?

46:10.184 --> 46:12.352
Because moving about
will help clear your head?

46:12.436 --> 46:14.813
-Your words sting a little.
-I don't mean to be nosy,

46:14.897 --> 46:17.399
but everyone knows about
your falling-out with Hye-jin.

46:20.360 --> 46:21.653
Stay for some <i>sikhye</i>.

46:27.451 --> 46:28.452
Thanks for this.

46:29.077 --> 46:31.455
It's to shut you up, so drink and leave.

46:33.749 --> 46:36.627
That I can't do. Make up with her already.

46:36.710 --> 46:40.339
I should've thrown you out
instead of inviting you in for a beverage.

46:41.924 --> 46:45.385
If you keep being like that,
my giving up on her won't be worthwhile.

46:47.554 --> 46:49.264
You just have to make me speechless.

46:49.348 --> 46:53.268
Right? There's nothing
you can possibly say to that. Right?

46:54.436 --> 46:55.604
We didn't argue.

46:56.271 --> 46:57.231
Then what?

46:58.440 --> 46:59.483
It's just that…

47:00.025 --> 47:02.736
I feel like I'm not worthy of her.

47:03.529 --> 47:07.115
She's transparent, honest, and brave…

47:08.867 --> 47:09.952
unlike me.

47:10.035 --> 47:15.541
Hold on. Does that mean you're vague,
dishonest, and a coward?

47:15.624 --> 47:19.795
Gosh, come on. I was only joking.

47:21.338 --> 47:24.424
But if that's the case,
isn't the solution quite simple?

47:25.092 --> 47:28.387
You can be just as transparent,
honest, and brave.

47:28.470 --> 47:30.639
I'm not in the mood for wordplay.

47:30.722 --> 47:31.807
But I'm being serious.

47:34.726 --> 47:39.481
Look. I don't know what you're holding,
but just lay all your cards on the table.

47:40.065 --> 47:43.068
Relationships aren't a poker game
where you bluff and make bets.

47:43.151 --> 47:46.113
Just be honest.
Show her what kind of person you are.

47:46.196 --> 47:47.948
Let her decide how she feels about it.

47:50.367 --> 47:52.119
But what if she's disappointed in me?

47:52.202 --> 47:55.539
No way. She'll accept you for who you are

47:55.622 --> 47:57.165
because that's who she is.

47:59.459 --> 48:02.296
Maybe you know her better than I do.

48:05.507 --> 48:06.466
Hey.

48:06.967 --> 48:12.055
There's no one in this world right now
who knows her better than you do.

48:21.023 --> 48:24.026
I could've just gone with Do-ha.
Why did you offer to go?

48:28.739 --> 48:29.573
Director Ji?

48:31.700 --> 48:32.993
-Director Ji?
-What?

48:33.910 --> 48:36.788
-Did you say something?
-What are you thinking so hard about?

48:36.872 --> 48:39.750
I met with Chief Hong earlier

48:39.833 --> 48:42.002
since he and Hye-jin hit a rough patch.

48:42.628 --> 48:44.254
I'm just worried about them.

48:45.922 --> 48:49.384
How is it that your mind
has room for such thoughts?

48:49.468 --> 48:51.094
Why do you worry about that?

48:51.178 --> 48:52.220
What?

48:52.304 --> 48:54.348
Focus on healing your own heart

48:54.431 --> 48:57.059
instead of worrying
about their lovers' quarrel.

48:57.142 --> 49:00.437
-My heart?
-Yes, your heart. I know it still hurts.

49:00.937 --> 49:02.606
You're still broken-hearted.

49:03.106 --> 49:04.107
Well…

49:05.359 --> 49:07.486
Actually, I'm fine.

49:08.570 --> 49:09.780
With what?

49:11.782 --> 49:15.327
I think I'm better now.

49:16.662 --> 49:19.122
I'm even better than I realized.

49:19.748 --> 49:20.749
Is that so?

49:21.875 --> 49:24.753
Then… That's a relief.

49:36.556 --> 49:39.434
Seriously? Keep your eyes on the road.
That scared me!

49:39.518 --> 49:42.062
-Sorry about that.
-That was terrifying.

49:42.145 --> 49:45.732
Gosh. Where's the emergency light?
Sorry about that.

50:17.973 --> 50:20.434
What? Hey, Hye-jin.

50:20.934 --> 50:23.186
Why did you send so much?

50:23.770 --> 50:25.564
For you to share with your boyfriend.

50:26.148 --> 50:28.817
The weather's hot,
so refrigerate the green onion kimchi.

50:28.900 --> 50:29.985
Can I talk to her?

50:30.068 --> 50:32.404
Hye-jin, your father wants to talk to you.

50:32.487 --> 50:33.321
<i>Sure.</i>

50:35.490 --> 50:36.324
Hey, Hye-jin.

50:36.408 --> 50:39.703
Hey, Dad. Is there
something you wanted to say?

50:39.786 --> 50:42.164
Well, it's nothing serious.

50:42.247 --> 50:46.501
Can you tell that friend of yours
that the plant's been growing well?

50:47.294 --> 50:50.505
<i>That even a flower
might blossom next spring.</i>

50:52.924 --> 50:56.636
And come visit us with him
when you're not too busy.

50:56.720 --> 50:59.473
I'll treat you to meat this time.

51:02.142 --> 51:03.935
<i>Hye-jin, are you still there?</i>

51:04.019 --> 51:05.979
Yes, I am.

51:06.062 --> 51:08.273
Hang up already so that she can rest.

51:08.356 --> 51:10.734
Right. Get some rest then.

51:10.817 --> 51:12.110
Bye, Dad.

51:24.956 --> 51:27.918
<i>Ever when he was a kid, he was so mature.</i>

51:28.502 --> 51:30.879
<i>He only learned how to hold himself back,</i>

51:31.463 --> 51:33.548
<i>so he doesn't know
how to open up to people.</i>

51:34.549 --> 51:35.675
No, because of me,

51:36.927 --> 51:38.553
my grandfather passed away.

51:40.096 --> 51:41.890
If only I hadn't gone out…

51:43.809 --> 51:45.560
to watch the World Cup matches.

51:46.436 --> 51:48.146
<i>For a long time,</i>

51:48.230 --> 51:52.108
<i>he hasn't had anyone
that he could share his pain with.</i>

51:52.776 --> 51:58.156
<i>I believe that you can be his rock,
someone he opens up to.</i>

52:13.463 --> 52:14.464
Jeong-u…

52:17.300 --> 52:18.927
Why did you want me home early?

52:20.971 --> 52:21.972
What…

52:23.473 --> 52:24.391
What's all this?

52:25.058 --> 52:27.978
I'm new to this,
so I don't know if I got it right.

52:29.604 --> 52:31.606
It's your grandfather's death anniversary.

52:32.274 --> 52:33.275
Jeong-u…

52:33.900 --> 52:36.862
Come on.
There's no need to be that touched.

52:36.945 --> 52:39.406
Seriously? Don't you know
even the simplest rule?

52:39.489 --> 52:42.534
Red sits in the east
while white sits in the west.

52:42.617 --> 52:46.413
Yes, of course.
Anyway, let's greet your grandfather.

52:46.496 --> 52:47.372
Sure.

53:30.332 --> 53:32.918
Hello, sir. I'm Park Jeong-u.

53:34.294 --> 53:36.004
I'm Du-sik's upperclassman,

53:36.630 --> 53:40.091
and your grandson is like a brother to me.

53:41.384 --> 53:43.637
I'll see to it
that he serves well in the military

53:44.471 --> 53:47.474
and that he gets married,
so don't you worry.

53:47.974 --> 53:49.601
So please look over us from above.

53:58.610 --> 53:59.694
Are you crying?

54:00.195 --> 54:01.363
No, I'm not.

54:01.947 --> 54:03.615
-But you are.
-I'm not.

54:03.698 --> 54:07.077
-But you're in tears.
-Dust blew into my eyes just now.

54:07.160 --> 54:10.288
-Your eyes are bloodshot.
-Stop saying I'm crying!

54:10.372 --> 54:11.456
Damn it.

54:13.792 --> 54:15.210
Where are you going?

54:18.254 --> 54:20.924
I feel so awkward
because I've never worn a suit before.

54:21.007 --> 54:23.301
Seon-a, how do I look? Do I look okay?

54:23.385 --> 54:26.346
Gosh, you look really nice.

54:27.222 --> 54:29.015
-Really?
-Yes.

54:29.099 --> 54:30.183
Don't you agree, honey?

54:32.602 --> 54:34.187
Du-sik.

54:34.270 --> 54:36.064
Did you leave your suit here?

54:36.898 --> 54:37.983
It has your name on it.

54:38.066 --> 54:39.859
Don't be ridiculous.

54:40.527 --> 54:41.653
How much is it?

54:43.113 --> 54:44.739
It's too expensive!

54:44.823 --> 54:46.950
-I can't.
-Don't be like that.

54:47.033 --> 54:48.785
I have a lot of money.

54:48.868 --> 54:52.539
And you made it as an intern at my firm.
Of course, I should get you this.

54:52.622 --> 54:55.458
Still. This is too expensive.

54:55.542 --> 54:59.129
When you get your first salary
as a regular employee,

54:59.212 --> 55:01.798
pay me back with a decent fishing rod.
That'll do.

55:01.881 --> 55:04.009
You've got to be kidding me.

55:04.092 --> 55:06.344
Are you already looking for a way
to extort him?

55:06.428 --> 55:10.265
Consider it done.
I'll be made a regular employee this time.

55:10.348 --> 55:14.644
Nice! Du-sik promised to show me
a great fishing spot in Gongjin.

55:14.728 --> 55:17.647
From what I hear, fish bite in seconds.

55:17.731 --> 55:18.815
Black piggy, right?

55:18.898 --> 55:20.316
No, it's black porgy.

55:20.400 --> 55:22.902
Yes, black porgy. I'll catch that for you.

55:22.986 --> 55:25.572
Getting the name right comes first.

55:49.888 --> 55:50.722
Leave.

55:51.848 --> 55:53.224
How dare you come here.

55:53.725 --> 55:56.144
How dare you show your face!

55:57.353 --> 56:00.398
Seon-a, I'm sorry.

56:00.482 --> 56:01.649
You're sorry?

56:02.358 --> 56:05.195
If you're that sorry,
bring Jeong-u back to me.

56:06.780 --> 56:09.991
Bring him back to life.
Bring him back to me!

56:10.533 --> 56:11.409
I'm sorry.

56:11.493 --> 56:15.413
Why did my innocent Jeong-u have to die?

56:15.497 --> 56:17.040
Why?

56:18.792 --> 56:20.752
It should've been you.

56:20.835 --> 56:23.129
You should've been the one to die!

56:23.213 --> 56:25.590
You should've died instead…

56:29.177 --> 56:30.303
I'm so sorry.

56:32.972 --> 56:36.017
-No…
-I'm so sorry.

56:39.312 --> 56:40.313
I'm sorry.

57:21.020 --> 57:22.355
Can I come in?

57:31.823 --> 57:33.158
Once again, it's not coffee.

57:33.241 --> 57:35.076
It's too deep into the night.

57:35.660 --> 57:39.289
Only one more shoot to go. There's
no need to pull an all-nighter now.

57:46.838 --> 57:47.797
Hold on.

57:55.138 --> 57:59.100
What the hell? Who said you could
take off my shield without permission?

57:59.184 --> 58:00.185
Ji-won,

58:00.768 --> 58:05.231
I thought long and hard
about what you said the other day.

58:10.528 --> 58:12.906
I offer two more large ones
than what they offered.

58:15.325 --> 58:18.620
Okay, fine. I'm in a generous mood.
Five large ones.

58:19.245 --> 58:22.790
So all you came up with is
"What's your price? I'll buy you off."

58:22.874 --> 58:24.334
Who are you to steal my line?

58:25.168 --> 58:29.964
You should be saying, "How much
can you offer? I need the money."

58:30.048 --> 58:31.716
Has the heat fried your brain?

58:31.799 --> 58:35.595
We can't do <i>Autumn in My Heart</i>
since we're in the middle of summer.

58:36.721 --> 58:39.098
Do-ha told me
you haven't signed any contract yet.

58:39.682 --> 58:40.517
So?

58:41.226 --> 58:45.522
After our talk the other day,
I was going to let you go.

58:45.605 --> 58:47.732
But Director Ji
without Writer Wang Ji-won?

58:48.775 --> 58:50.443
I couldn't even picture it.

58:54.072 --> 58:56.074
I still have so much
I want to do with you.

58:57.617 --> 59:02.497
Come on. We agreed to do a summer
special mystery horror show a while ago.

59:02.580 --> 59:04.332
-Do you remember that?
-I do.

59:05.375 --> 59:09.003
The Red Mask, Hong Kong Granny,
and the plushy ghost.

59:09.754 --> 59:12.465
The show would feature ghosts
that terrorized us as kids.

59:12.549 --> 59:14.551
Exactly. You remember it all.

59:14.634 --> 59:16.928
Yes, and I'll sell the idea
to just about anyone.

59:17.011 --> 59:18.638
Sure, the idea's all yours.

59:18.721 --> 59:22.100
That easily?
You know you could sue me for it.

59:22.183 --> 59:25.603
I don't care.
You'll end up doing it with me anyway.

59:27.146 --> 59:28.231
What do you mean?

59:28.982 --> 59:30.608
This is the conclusion I came to.

59:31.526 --> 59:33.778
It's not over until it's over.

59:35.572 --> 59:37.282
So I'm starting over

59:37.365 --> 59:42.245
and joining the long list of candidates
who are trying to court you.

59:45.331 --> 59:46.416
Here.

59:49.127 --> 59:52.630
I hope things turn out for the best,
Writer Wang Ji-won.

1:00:13.276 --> 1:00:14.444
Damn, that's hot!

1:00:17.864 --> 1:00:19.449
I came here

1:00:20.158 --> 1:00:23.828
because my mom sent
side dishes for you too.

1:00:23.911 --> 1:00:26.956
The green onion kimchi
should be refrigerated before it ripens.

1:00:27.957 --> 1:00:29.751
I see. Please tell her I'm grateful.

1:00:32.545 --> 1:00:35.965
Also, I'm done thinking about us.

1:00:37.175 --> 1:00:38.009
What?

1:00:38.092 --> 1:00:41.304
Chief Hong, you know patience
isn't my strong suit.

1:00:42.972 --> 1:00:45.516
-I do.
-I moved to Gongjin

1:00:45.600 --> 1:00:47.435
only after thinking about it for a day.

1:00:48.227 --> 1:00:49.062
I'm aware of that.

1:00:50.146 --> 1:00:52.231
I hate it when things are vague.

1:00:52.940 --> 1:00:55.860
Things that are ambiguous
don't sit well with me.

1:00:56.736 --> 1:00:58.154
So what I want to say is…

1:01:00.740 --> 1:01:02.617
Despite our current situation,

1:01:03.618 --> 1:01:05.495
if you can promise

1:01:06.329 --> 1:01:09.415
that you'll someday open up to me,

1:01:10.500 --> 1:01:12.335
I could wait.

1:01:17.757 --> 1:01:20.385
I'm not asking you
to open up to me right now.

1:01:21.135 --> 1:01:24.597
All I want is for you
to acknowledge the possibility.

1:01:26.557 --> 1:01:30.269
Am I a part of the future you paint?

1:01:32.063 --> 1:01:36.067
And do you think that
you could see a future with me?

1:01:37.110 --> 1:01:38.861
That's all I wanted to know.

1:01:42.448 --> 1:01:44.325
It's what I want too, but--

1:01:44.409 --> 1:01:45.993
Leave it at that.

1:01:46.077 --> 1:01:47.537
Nothing else matters

1:01:48.287 --> 1:01:50.456
if that's what you
ultimately want as well.

1:01:51.666 --> 1:01:53.418
Then we're good. I'm willing to wait.

1:01:54.794 --> 1:01:55.878
Hye-jin.

1:01:55.962 --> 1:01:57.880
I've made up my mind,

1:01:58.589 --> 1:02:00.717
but I'll give you
some extra time to think.

1:02:02.552 --> 1:02:04.095
But let's end the break.

1:02:05.680 --> 1:02:07.140
You can think while we date.

1:02:08.307 --> 1:02:10.268
Take your time while we're together.

1:02:15.106 --> 1:02:17.108
But don't make me wait too long.

1:02:40.548 --> 1:02:41.883
-It's good.
-It is.

1:02:42.884 --> 1:02:44.135
That's great.

1:02:44.218 --> 1:02:45.178
Is that Ms. Gam-ri's <i>sikhye</i>?

1:02:45.261 --> 1:02:46.387
-Yes.
-Tell me about it.

1:02:50.933 --> 1:02:53.478
Guys, that was the bomb!

1:02:54.061 --> 1:02:55.313
Good job, everyone.

1:02:55.396 --> 1:02:58.107
-Good job.
-Good job!

1:02:58.191 --> 1:03:00.193
-Thank you.
-Good job, guys.

1:03:00.276 --> 1:03:01.819
-Good job, Director Ji.
-Good job.

1:03:01.903 --> 1:03:03.029
-Good job.
-Nice.

1:03:03.112 --> 1:03:06.783
-Thank you!
-You guys did great. Chief Hong, thanks.

1:03:06.866 --> 1:03:08.493
I didn't do much.

1:03:08.576 --> 1:03:11.746
From handling the location
to the props and filming,

1:03:11.829 --> 1:03:13.414
you helped in every aspect.

1:03:13.498 --> 1:03:15.583
It ended well all thanks to your help.

1:03:15.666 --> 1:03:18.294
This much expression of gratitude
is too much for me.

1:03:18.377 --> 1:03:19.212
Jeez.

1:03:19.295 --> 1:03:22.089
Chief Hong,
I'm grateful for everything too.

1:03:22.173 --> 1:03:26.052
The medicinal herb you gave my father
helped him regain his energy.

1:03:26.135 --> 1:03:28.095
I'm glad. I'll get you some more later.

1:03:28.179 --> 1:03:30.932
That's not why I said it.
I won't forget your kindness.

1:03:31.015 --> 1:03:34.143
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm just glad your father's better.

1:03:34.227 --> 1:03:37.146
Nonchalantly sweet and generous.
You're so cool.

1:03:38.648 --> 1:03:40.107
When did you two get so close?

1:03:40.983 --> 1:03:42.610
Hey, Ms. Gam-ri.

1:03:43.444 --> 1:03:45.029
What? A stock pot?

1:03:48.407 --> 1:03:50.576
-Ms. Gam-ri!
-Hey.

1:03:51.285 --> 1:03:53.830
I said I'd bring it over to you.

1:03:53.913 --> 1:03:57.458
I took a walk to lessen the boredom
and ended up here.

1:03:57.542 --> 1:03:59.961
Gosh. Anyway, what do you need this for?

1:04:00.044 --> 1:04:03.172
-Well, I heard there'd be an after-party.
-Right.

1:04:03.256 --> 1:04:07.176
So I was cooking <i>yukgaejang</i> for the staff,

1:04:07.260 --> 1:04:12.390
but Mat-i dozed off
and burned the stock pot.

1:04:12.473 --> 1:04:15.142
I'm burning with anger right now.

1:04:15.810 --> 1:04:18.896
-So you're making a new batch?
-Yes. It won't take long.

1:04:18.980 --> 1:04:21.440
I see. I guess I have no choice then.

1:04:21.524 --> 1:04:24.026
Since it's so hot today,
I should give you a piggyback

1:04:24.110 --> 1:04:25.945
to help conserve your energy.

1:04:26.737 --> 1:04:31.659
Don't be ridiculous. Why would you
carry me when my ankle is fine?

1:04:31.742 --> 1:04:34.078
Come on. Hop on while I tell you nicely.

1:04:35.037 --> 1:04:39.333
Well, it does seem you have
a broad enough back for it.

1:04:39.417 --> 1:04:41.752
-Why are you stating the obvious?
-Get up.

1:04:43.838 --> 1:04:44.714
Let's go.

1:04:44.797 --> 1:04:46.382
Let me at least carry it for you.

1:04:48.259 --> 1:04:49.802
-Du-sik.
-Yes?

1:04:50.803 --> 1:04:53.180
You and the doctor had an argument, right?

1:04:54.849 --> 1:04:57.727
Unbelievable.
I see that everyone in Gongjin knows.

1:04:57.810 --> 1:04:59.687
Even the neighborhood dog would know.

1:05:01.272 --> 1:05:05.276
Just go tell her that you're sorry
and give her a hug.

1:05:05.985 --> 1:05:10.489
What if she gets tired of waiting
and ends up giving up on you?

1:05:12.491 --> 1:05:16.245
This kind of relationship
isn't easy to come by,

1:05:16.329 --> 1:05:18.456
so you must do your best not to lose it.

1:05:21.834 --> 1:05:22.835
Du-sik.

1:05:24.003 --> 1:05:29.759
I love how you now have
Dr. Yoon by your side.

1:05:31.052 --> 1:05:34.430
How you help others is admirable,

1:05:34.513 --> 1:05:36.807
but you must live your own life too.

1:05:39.352 --> 1:05:43.397
Eat a lot of good food and be happy.

1:05:43.981 --> 1:05:46.317
Seeing you happy will make me happy

1:05:46.400 --> 1:05:48.611
and also make Dr. Yoon happy.

1:05:49.779 --> 1:05:53.866
I'm sure everyone in Gongjin
thinks the same way.

1:05:54.867 --> 1:05:55.868
Grandma,

1:05:57.286 --> 1:05:59.121
am I allowed to do that?

1:05:59.622 --> 1:06:03.501
Yes, of course. You deserve it.

1:06:05.836 --> 1:06:10.216
I know these past years
haven't been easy for you.

1:06:11.300 --> 1:06:14.887
Don't worry about other things now,

1:06:15.596 --> 1:06:16.973
and only think about yourself.

1:06:34.657 --> 1:06:36.742
Hey, it's been a while.

1:06:36.826 --> 1:06:38.411
<i>It sure has.</i>

1:06:38.494 --> 1:06:39.745
Have you been well?

1:06:40.663 --> 1:06:41.664
How's school?

1:06:41.747 --> 1:06:43.541
<i>Same old, same old.</i>

1:06:43.624 --> 1:06:46.419
<i>Not you though. Rumor has it
that you moved to a small town.</i>

1:06:47.169 --> 1:06:49.338
Yes, it ended up that way.

1:06:50.047 --> 1:06:51.549
Anyway, what's the occasion?

1:06:52.383 --> 1:06:55.094
You never call just to check up on me.

1:06:55.177 --> 1:06:58.723
<i>I always liked how you cut to the chase.
Come back to Seoul.</i>

1:06:58.806 --> 1:07:02.143
What? That's out of the blue.

1:07:02.893 --> 1:07:06.397
<i>A clinical professor job opened up,
so I thought I'd recommend you.</i>

1:07:10.818 --> 1:07:11.986
I see.

1:07:36.385 --> 1:07:37.470
Let's go.

1:07:38.220 --> 1:07:39.180
Sure.

1:07:52.943 --> 1:07:54.987
Goodness.

1:07:55.488 --> 1:07:58.449
-Here you go.
-Take those for her.

1:07:58.532 --> 1:08:02.078
It's <i>yukgaejang</i> I made. Try it.

1:08:02.161 --> 1:08:04.080
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1:08:05.122 --> 1:08:06.665
Once you leave town,

1:08:06.749 --> 1:08:09.543
I'll only see you again
when we meet in the afterlife.

1:08:09.627 --> 1:08:12.338
Don't say that.
I'm going to come visit you for meals.

1:08:12.421 --> 1:08:14.131
-What?
-Should I not come over?

1:08:14.215 --> 1:08:16.509
Gosh. Of course you should come!

1:08:16.592 --> 1:08:19.512
Of course. You're always welcome.

1:08:19.595 --> 1:08:21.347
-Okay.
-Good.

1:08:22.807 --> 1:08:26.352
Nam-suk, can you get them
bowls of <i>yukgaejang</i>?

1:08:26.435 --> 1:08:27.728
-Sure.
-Enjoy.

1:08:27.812 --> 1:08:29.313
-You too.
-It's coming.

1:08:29.396 --> 1:08:32.817
Here comes the <i>yukgaejang</i>.

1:08:39.657 --> 1:08:40.908
Here you go.

1:08:43.536 --> 1:08:45.788
Your <i>yukgaejang</i> is served.

1:08:45.871 --> 1:08:47.706
-Right.
-Thanks.

1:08:49.834 --> 1:08:51.210
Don't make it so obvious.

1:08:51.710 --> 1:08:53.045
-What?
-What?

1:08:53.879 --> 1:08:56.590
I have no clue what you're talking about.

1:08:56.674 --> 1:08:59.426
As if. Remember that night?

1:08:59.969 --> 1:09:02.388
You two got back together thanks to me.

1:09:02.471 --> 1:09:03.848
My little white lie.

1:09:04.431 --> 1:09:08.102
Things worked out for the best
because I told that little lie.

1:09:08.185 --> 1:09:09.311
Don't you like shrimp?

1:09:09.395 --> 1:09:10.896
-Yes, I love them.
-Have this.

1:09:10.980 --> 1:09:13.524
It's hot! Hey,
you should be nicer to me now.

1:09:13.607 --> 1:09:15.526
What the hell are you saying?

1:09:15.609 --> 1:09:17.987
You should've said that it was hot!

1:09:18.070 --> 1:09:20.281
That's because they've been deep fried.

1:09:20.364 --> 1:09:22.950
And your heart's been fried with love.

1:09:23.951 --> 1:09:27.454
She'd make a great K-pop idol singer too.

1:09:27.538 --> 1:09:28.914
Hye-jin.

1:09:28.998 --> 1:09:30.166
Hey, Seong-hyeon.

1:09:30.249 --> 1:09:32.626
-Hey. You should get eating.
-Sure.

1:09:32.710 --> 1:09:35.254
-Thanks for coming.
-I'm the one who should thank you.

1:09:35.796 --> 1:09:39.300
Thanks to your show,
the whole town of Gongjin perked up,

1:09:39.383 --> 1:09:40.676
and everyone had a blast.

1:09:40.759 --> 1:09:43.012
Right, of course.

1:09:43.095 --> 1:09:44.930
I'm even more grateful to hear that.

1:09:45.514 --> 1:09:47.725
-I should give you some privacy.
-Right.

1:09:47.808 --> 1:09:49.894
I'm not that dense, you see.

1:09:49.977 --> 1:09:51.937
-Gosh.
-Gosh, hello.

1:09:52.521 --> 1:09:53.898
I'm glad I ran into you again.

1:09:53.981 --> 1:09:55.065
Same here.

1:09:55.941 --> 1:09:59.069
I feel like I was able to complete
an unfinished task in life.

1:09:59.153 --> 1:10:02.948
All right, everyone.
It seems like the right time

1:10:03.032 --> 1:10:06.702
to hear a few words from Director Ji.

1:10:06.785 --> 1:10:08.621
Yes, go ahead!

1:10:13.500 --> 1:10:15.085
Look how handsome he is!

1:10:16.253 --> 1:10:18.839
Gosh, this sure is embarrassing.

1:10:18.923 --> 1:10:23.344
Anyway, thanks to
your consideration and generosity,

1:10:23.427 --> 1:10:25.596
filming was able to go smoothly.

1:10:25.679 --> 1:10:28.057
Your smiles and encouragement,

1:10:28.140 --> 1:10:30.434
I'll never forget them.

1:10:30.517 --> 1:10:33.145
Please watch the show when it airs.
Thank you!

1:10:35.314 --> 1:10:36.315
Director Ji!

1:10:36.398 --> 1:10:38.817
Since you're there, sing a song for us.

1:10:38.901 --> 1:10:40.402
-Sorry?
-It's an after-party.

1:10:40.486 --> 1:10:43.489
Suk-ja, you just don't know
when to shut up.

1:10:44.073 --> 1:10:47.409
She's right.
Sing a song since you're up there.

1:10:47.493 --> 1:10:49.078
Gosh, no.

1:10:49.161 --> 1:10:51.413
-Sing us a song.
-Go for it!

1:10:51.497 --> 1:10:53.123
-Sing for us!
-Sing for us!

1:10:53.207 --> 1:10:56.293
-Sing for us.
-<i>Don't sing and you'll stay single</i>

1:10:56.794 --> 1:10:59.421
<i>-You poor soul
-You poor soul</i>

1:10:59.505 --> 1:11:02.466
<i>-One, two, one, two
-One, two, one, two</i>

1:11:02.549 --> 1:11:04.260
<i>-one, two, three
-one, two, three</i>

1:11:04.343 --> 1:11:06.387
<i>-One, two, three, four!</i>
-All right.

1:11:07.221 --> 1:11:10.557
I'm not particularly good at it,
so I'll keep it short.

1:11:22.820 --> 1:11:25.823
<i>It takes new love</i>

1:11:25.906 --> 1:11:30.619
<i>To forget about an old one</i>

1:11:31.161 --> 1:11:35.207
<i>We seem to be on the right track</i>

1:11:35.291 --> 1:11:37.209
<i>I don't have any regrets</i>

1:11:37.793 --> 1:11:41.255
<i>Trust our laughter</i>

1:11:42.256 --> 1:11:46.135
<i>Let's stop being sorry</i>

1:11:47.094 --> 1:11:52.182
<i>It's all in the past</i>

1:11:52.266 --> 1:11:57.479
<i>Whoever brought the pain</i>

1:11:57.563 --> 1:12:01.775
<i>You remain as the song</i>

1:12:01.859 --> 1:12:07.865
<i>That brings me helplessly to tears</i>

1:12:07.948 --> 1:12:13.037
<i>I believed it would be momentary</i>

1:12:13.120 --> 1:12:17.875
<i>When I tossed and turned, unable to sleep</i>

1:12:18.459 --> 1:12:23.380
<i>You reached out and held my hand</i>

1:12:23.464 --> 1:12:29.178
<i>Someone new entered my life</i>

1:12:29.261 --> 1:12:32.681
<i>Let it stay this way</i>

1:12:34.433 --> 1:12:41.440
<i>La la la la la la</i>

1:12:43.650 --> 1:12:46.153
-No way.
-My gosh.

1:12:49.990 --> 1:12:52.284
-That wasn't any good.
-Jeez.

1:12:53.952 --> 1:12:55.120
Gosh.

1:13:01.710 --> 1:13:03.379
Can we talk?

1:13:03.462 --> 1:13:04.463
Sure.

1:13:15.182 --> 1:13:16.183
Chief Hong.

1:13:18.644 --> 1:13:21.230
Why come all this way
just to say something?

1:13:24.942 --> 1:13:28.404
Hye-jin, would you like to come over
after the after-party?

1:13:28.487 --> 1:13:30.155
Did you bring me here to ask that?

1:13:30.823 --> 1:13:33.867
Yes, there's something
I must tell you today.

1:13:35.285 --> 1:13:38.747
It will probably be a very long story.

1:13:40.874 --> 1:13:42.584
Do you still want to hear it?

1:13:43.836 --> 1:13:45.838
Sure. I'd love to.

1:13:47.673 --> 1:13:48.882
You can talk all night.

1:13:49.758 --> 1:13:52.719
Tomorrow's Sunday,
so I don't have to go to work.

1:13:55.222 --> 1:13:59.518
And I also have something to tell you.

1:13:59.601 --> 1:14:04.189
Okay. We'll talk later then.
We'll talk about everything.

1:14:04.273 --> 1:14:05.274
Sure.

1:14:14.450 --> 1:14:16.618
-Where did they go?
-Who?

1:14:17.494 --> 1:14:19.663
Did Chief Hong and Dr. Yoon
skip out already?

1:14:19.746 --> 1:14:22.207
Yes, they left together earlier.

1:14:22.291 --> 1:14:25.294
Bo-ra, you can't tell on them like that.

1:14:25.377 --> 1:14:26.670
Do you have a death wish?

1:14:28.464 --> 1:14:29.631
He's right, Bo-ra.

1:14:29.715 --> 1:14:33.719
You should learn to turn a blind eye
when it comes to business between adults.

1:14:34.678 --> 1:14:37.514
I guess they're back on good terms again.

1:14:37.598 --> 1:14:40.726
It looks that way, and I'm glad.

1:14:40.809 --> 1:14:42.603
I knew it, you know.

1:14:42.686 --> 1:14:44.813
Anyone can tell they're in love.

1:14:44.897 --> 1:14:50.152
Exactly. He used to address her
as "Ms. Dentist" with a frown on his face,

1:14:50.235 --> 1:14:53.530
but now he calls her Hye-jin.

1:14:55.073 --> 1:14:57.159
My ears can only take so much.

1:14:57.743 --> 1:15:02.414
But Hye-jin still calls him Chief Hong,
and not by his name.

1:15:02.498 --> 1:15:03.916
-Really?
-Yes.

1:15:03.999 --> 1:15:07.044
It must've become a habit for her
just like the rest of us.

1:15:07.127 --> 1:15:11.465
Or she might choose not to
since his name's on the dowdy side.

1:15:12.090 --> 1:15:15.260
It's why I suggested
that he change his name.

1:15:15.344 --> 1:15:17.930
Take me for instance.
Oh Yoon. How perfect is that?

1:15:18.013 --> 1:15:21.517
I was surprised when I heard his name too.
It didn't match his looks.

1:15:21.600 --> 1:15:22.559
It does surprise you.

1:15:23.143 --> 1:15:24.937
Why? What's his name?

1:15:25.646 --> 1:15:26.647
Chief Hong's name?

1:15:27.314 --> 1:15:30.192
-No way.
-Oh, here they come.

1:15:30.275 --> 1:15:32.611
-Right here.
-You seem much better.

1:15:32.694 --> 1:15:35.572
-What do you mean?
-Gosh, don't do that.

1:15:35.656 --> 1:15:37.658
Fine, let me clear it instead.

1:15:39.785 --> 1:15:42.412
Chief Hong, is your name Hong Du-sik?

1:15:42.496 --> 1:15:43.622
What? Yes, it is.

1:15:44.122 --> 1:15:46.375
Did you perhaps work
at YK Asset Management?

1:15:52.506 --> 1:15:53.840
Do you know Kim Gi-hun?

1:16:00.055 --> 1:16:02.099
Hi, Mr. Hong. Good morning.

1:16:02.182 --> 1:16:04.434
Yes, hello. Good morning to you too.

1:16:04.518 --> 1:16:06.812
It's hot outside, so here you go.

1:16:06.895 --> 1:16:09.648
You don't have to always get me one.

1:16:10.148 --> 1:16:12.109
There was a buy-one-get-one-free deal.

1:16:12.192 --> 1:16:14.319
Who am I to refuse a freebie, right?

1:16:14.403 --> 1:16:16.697
Convenience stores have
buy-two-get-one-free deals.

1:16:16.780 --> 1:16:18.448
Aren't you buying one more for me?

1:16:18.532 --> 1:16:21.660
No way. The place in my neighborhood
has a different policy.

1:16:22.160 --> 1:16:22.995
Anyway, enjoy.

1:16:25.372 --> 1:16:26.790
Thank you!

1:16:26.873 --> 1:16:27.958
Don't mention it.

1:16:33.380 --> 1:16:36.174
<i>Well, my father is a bit ill.</i>

1:16:36.258 --> 1:16:38.135
He's paraplegic.

1:16:38.218 --> 1:16:41.722
I heard those beans increase blood flow
and help with paralysis,

1:16:41.805 --> 1:16:42.889
so I got some.

1:16:45.601 --> 1:16:46.893
You know my dad, don't you?

1:16:48.228 --> 1:16:50.439
Hong Du-sik, you bastard!

1:16:53.650 --> 1:16:54.568
Chief Hong?

1:16:54.651 --> 1:16:56.445
-What?
-What the hell?

1:17:16.798 --> 1:17:18.925
DU-SIK AND HYE-JIN'S BUCKET LIST

1:17:29.019 --> 1:17:31.313
6. MAKE YOU HAPPY

1:17:46.078 --> 1:17:49.623
<i>Be happy with you for a very long time.</i>

1:18:35.293 --> 1:18:36.169
Don't follow me.

1:18:36.253 --> 1:18:38.004
I'm worried about you.

1:18:38.088 --> 1:18:41.842
I'm the one who did that
to Do-ha's father.

1:18:41.925 --> 1:18:46.471
I don't know what's going on anymore.
I really don't know.

1:18:47.639 --> 1:18:50.183
Sir, just trust me and wait.

1:18:51.268 --> 1:18:52.227
<i>Mr. Hong.</i>

1:18:53.645 --> 1:18:55.897
<i>It must've been so hard for you.</i>

1:18:56.648 --> 1:18:59.401
<i>You must've hidden the pain deep down.</i>

1:18:59.901 --> 1:19:02.362
You've been holding onto such a burden.

1:19:02.863 --> 1:19:04.197
I'm really sorry.

1:19:04.906 --> 1:19:06.074
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1:19:09.286 --> 1:19:14.291
