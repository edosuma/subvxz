12:55.475 --> 12:57.142
Who's gonna pay for that?

12:57.144 --> 12:59.644
  You don't even know
  if a crime has been committed.

12:59.646 --> 13:01.646
Look, man, there is blood
all over that place.

13:01.648 --> 13:03.314
              From a bunch
              of cut up animals.

13:03.316 --> 13:05.784
Those carcasses were
all done outside the camper.

13:05.786 --> 13:07.585
      So, what's
      your explanation, Officer?

13:07.587 --> 13:10.388
      We got us a Charles Manson
      living in the woods

13:10.390 --> 13:12.390
    behind Lowell Grippo's farm?

13:12.392 --> 13:13.792
              Does that
              make sense to you?

13:13.794 --> 13:15.426
   I'll tell you what doesn't
   make sense to me,

13:15.428 --> 13:17.529
     is why the fuck
     you're so sure nothing
     happened out there.

13:21.101 --> 13:22.200
           Sir.

13:26.973 --> 13:30.909
All right, Officer.

13:30.911 --> 13:35.947
They teach you how
to use a fingerprint kit
at the community college?

13:35.949 --> 13:37.582
                     Yes, sir.

13:37.584 --> 13:40.852
You want to spend your shift
tagging beer bottles
and used condoms?

13:40.854 --> 13:42.487
Knock yourself out.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.190

This doesn't seem
very official.

     Don't leave any marks.

ANDERSON: Is there
anything you haven't told us
before we get started?

14:23.463 --> 14:26.397
  It's pretty straightforward.
  Blake was my partner
  for seven years.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.533
     He was my best friend,
     and then...

14:29.636 --> 14:31.769
      This thing in here
      isn't Blake Morreau.

14:33.473 --> 14:35.139
     Just watch yourselves.

14:35.141 --> 14:38.343
         He's restrained, right?
    It's not that. He...

14:38.345 --> 14:40.645

     BLAKE: (chuckles)

14:42.015 --> 14:44.616

      I can't believe
      you haven't come

14:51.524 --> 14:54.392
LUKE:
I don't know
who you are...

14:54.394 --> 14:57.262
but you're not my pal.
              Come on,
              don't be that way.

14:57.264 --> 15:01.332
      How should he be...
      after you killed his wife?

15:01.334 --> 15:04.402
LUKE:
This is Reverend Anderson

15:04.404 --> 15:06.104
They're here to help you.

15:08.074 --> 15:10.708

15:10.710 --> 15:13.111
               Sit. Please.

15:13.113 --> 15:15.747
               I'd shake, but...
               you know.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.950
                   It's awkward.

15:18.952 --> 15:22.620
ANDERSON:
Luke here says there's
something inside you,

15:22.622 --> 15:24.255
something that made
you do...

15:24.257 --> 15:26.357
                   what you did.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.962
          Huh? Inside?

15:30.964 --> 15:32.563

    ANDERSON: That's right.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.632
                   Is that true?

15:34.634 --> 15:37.235

15:38.772 --> 15:42.006

                  (laughing)

15:43.944 --> 15:45.810
            It's not about
            what's inside of me.

15:45.812 --> 15:47.612
             ANDERSON: It's not?

15:47.614 --> 15:49.147
    BLAKE:
    No, no, no, no, no, no.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.349

15:54.654 --> 15:57.155

16:07.767 --> 16:10.969
    I liked that, but then...

16:10.971 --> 16:13.972
        the warmness
        and the wetness

16:13.974 --> 16:16.507

       <i> it got cold,</i>

        What the fuck

16:28.288 --> 16:30.321
     You were a good friend
     to me, Luke.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.491
             Such a good friend.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.593
        I really wasn't.

16:36.830 --> 16:38.329

wasn't a spiritual man.

18:39.886 --> 18:42.753
     Are you?
            "Though your sins
            are like scarlet,

18:52.565 --> 18:54.198

      that make you feel?

       in your mouth?

18:58.738 --> 19:00.204
       It makes me sick.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.510
         Luke and I saw
         a lot of sin.

19:05.512 --> 19:09.614
           More than you will
           ever see in your line
           of work, Reverend.

19:09.616 --> 19:12.783
      But what turned my stomach
      wasn't the sin,

19:12.785 --> 19:15.319
         it was the forgiveness.

19:15.321 --> 19:17.955
          People willing to turn
          the other cheek,

19:17.957 --> 19:19.690
                 forgive...

19:19.692 --> 19:21.526
              the unforgivable,

19:21.528 --> 19:24.195
      because it's
      the Christian thing to do.

19:24.197 --> 19:26.364
  Look at my pathetic partner
  out there.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.167
     I opened up his wife

19:29.169 --> 19:30.701
      with my bare hands,

19:30.703 --> 19:32.703
          and he wants
          to help me.

19:34.641 --> 19:38.042
                  Put that away.

hallowed be thy name.

                our daily bread,

19:49.522 --> 19:51.322
        and forgive us
        our trespasses

             It's just too good.

20:11.744 --> 20:14.145
               What else you got
               in there? Yeah.

20:14.147 --> 20:16.214
   Some chicken bones,
   some snakes for us to handle?

20:16.216 --> 20:20.685
          Praise the baby Jesus.
          I am saved.

20:20.687 --> 20:22.820
All right, all right,
all right, come on.

20:22.822 --> 20:25.389
          Our work here is done.
          What?

20:25.391 --> 20:26.757
               Wait.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.526
Already?
What do you mean?

20:28.528 --> 20:30.661
       Use your intuition, Kyle.

20:30.663 --> 20:32.263
            Read the signs.

20:33.199 --> 20:34.665
                Is that what
                Josh was like?

20:34.667 --> 20:36.934
              Or your mother?
              Your wife?

20:36.936 --> 20:39.904
No, but you said demons
could be as different
as the souls they possess.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.606
             Yes, they can.
             Yes, they can.

20:41.608 --> 20:44.976
    But some souls
    are capable of creating evil
    without the devil's help.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.082
       Let me try.

20:52.018 --> 20:54.285
                 Why?

20:54.287 --> 20:56.854
We're supposed
to be fighting demons
two by two, isn't that right?

20:58.558 --> 21:00.658
         That's what
         the Bible says, anyway.

21:08.201 --> 21:09.700
        Do you know me?

21:13.239 --> 21:14.639
               Maybe.

21:18.544 --> 21:21.379
           How? We've never met.

21:21.381 --> 21:24.248
               (chuckles) Fine.

21:24.250 --> 21:26.217
              Then what the fuck
              did you ask for?

21:30.056 --> 21:32.223
   Do you know me?

21:39.999 --> 21:42.800
                   (grunting)
                   (sizzling)

21:46.572 --> 21:50.074
          Shit. Shit.

21:57.650 --> 22:00.084
                BLAKE: (gasping)

22:03.323 --> 22:04.422
                 You...

22:05.425 --> 22:06.424
                 are outcast?

22:10.096 --> 22:12.496
                 Why does this
                 keep happening?

22:13.433 --> 22:14.999
      I don't know.

22:16.035 --> 22:18.436
         You and Amy are like...
         (inhales)

22:18.438 --> 22:20.338
           dynamite and a match.

22:20.340 --> 22:23.841
          You know what
          happens when you put
          those together, right?

22:23.843 --> 22:26.877
It's not my fault.
She just keeps
bumping into me.

22:29.115 --> 22:31.282
              Just... um...

22:31.284 --> 22:34.819
             you know,
             don't let her cross
             your orbit.

22:34.821 --> 22:37.121
I tried, but she goes
wherever I want to be.

22:37.123 --> 22:40.224
It's like if I want
to hang out with Emma

36:13.105 --> 36:14.871
          What else I got to do?

36:14.873 --> 36:17.307
        Your family is not safe.
        Don't listen to him.

36:17.309 --> 36:19.776
   You will never be free of us.
               It's not true!

36:19.778 --> 36:23.013
  Oh, I'm afraid it is, outcast,
  but you know that
  already, don't you?

36:23.015 --> 36:26.516
       (grunts)
                       (screams)

36:33.392 --> 36:34.558
       (bottle shatters)

36:38.664 --> 36:40.197
Tell me who you are!

36:43.068 --> 36:44.968
Why did you call me that? Huh?

36:44.970 --> 36:46.136
                    (spits)

36:50.309 --> 36:53.543
           (sizzles)
           Ah! (coughing)

36:54.580 --> 36:57.881
          (gagging)

37:14.933 --> 37:16.600
            More.

37:16.602 --> 37:19.903
           (chuckles)

37:19.905 --> 37:22.939
           (laughing)

37:29.615 --> 37:31.348
                         More.

37:36.088 --> 37:37.954
     Oh, thank you,
     Officer Nunez.

37:37.956 --> 37:39.356
         Looking good.

37:41.960 --> 37:47.097
     Whoa. Looks like you've had
     a productive day, Mr. CSI.

37:47.099 --> 37:49.399
Well, I didn't get
any clean prints,

37:49.401 --> 37:51.468
but I did get some fibers.
There's a lot of 'em.

37:51.470 --> 37:53.903
I got some hair.

37:53.905 --> 37:56.406
I don't know if it's human
or animal, but...

37:56.408 --> 37:59.809
Also, I was able to test
all the blood stains,

37:59.811 --> 38:01.411
 and I got that.

38:01.413 --> 38:03.947
Does not look like something
a teenager would wear.

38:03.949 --> 38:05.615
               It sure does not.

38:05.617 --> 38:07.250
I mean,
if somebody stole that,

38:07.252 --> 38:09.552
you know, they sure as hell
ain't gonna leave it
out there.

38:09.554 --> 38:11.955
       Hell's bells, that's some
       good work, Officer.

38:11.957 --> 38:14.758
(chuckles)
Also, I found a lab

38:14.760 --> 38:16.760
that'll do all
the DNA testing.

38:16.762 --> 38:19.729
It's not that expensive,
but it takes about a month.

38:20.666 --> 38:22.132
         I'll take it from here.

38:22.134 --> 38:23.967
             What?

38:23.969 --> 38:26.936
     I want you to put
     all that stuff in my office
     along with your report.

38:26.938 --> 38:28.972
    And get yourself cleaned up.

38:30.275 --> 38:32.575
            (sighs)

38:32.577 --> 38:34.144
         Come on, man.

38:39.451 --> 38:41.651
He said I'd never
be free of this.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.820
        He was manipulating you,

38:43.822 --> 38:45.722
      making you doubt yourself.

38:47.693 --> 38:50.527
What about you?
He make you doubt yourself?

38:50.529 --> 38:53.963
   Your holy war?
                Not a bit.

38:53.965 --> 38:56.366
         We won't give up
         until we save that man.

38:57.469 --> 38:58.702
          Rev.

39:00.305 --> 39:02.005
He can't be saved.

39:02.007 --> 39:04.174
Whatever's in him
is there to stay.

39:11.817 --> 39:13.550
         (door buzzes)

39:15.153 --> 39:17.854
      (rain pattering)
      (thunder rumbling)

39:32.404 --> 39:34.371
I love snuggling with you...

39:36.007 --> 39:37.574
listening to the rain.

39:38.510 --> 39:39.809
                    Me too.

39:43.215 --> 39:45.181
          (kissing)

39:45.183 --> 39:46.716
                    Mmm.

39:46.718 --> 39:49.185
                    What's that?

39:49.187 --> 39:52.322
Oh, that's just
some unfinished business
from this morning.

39:53.759 --> 39:56.259
  I thought I told you
  to take care of that yourself.

39:56.261 --> 39:59.095
Well, you see, I was busy
making pancakes, so...

40:00.165 --> 40:03.500
            (chuckles) Right.
       Mm-hmm.

40:03.502 --> 40:05.769
              Well, I guess
              you earned it.
         Mmm.

40:36.935 --> 40:39.636
         (both moaning)

40:53.285 --> 40:56.119
               (gasps)
               (moans)

40:56.121 --> 40:57.620
What? Did I hurt you?

40:57.622 --> 41:00.089
           No, no. It, uh...

41:00.091 --> 41:02.058
         It's not that. I, um...

41:02.994 --> 41:04.127
                 I...

41:05.063 --> 41:08.131
                I-- I can't.
         Okay.

41:10.101 --> 41:11.835
 Are you okay?
                Mm-hmm.

41:11.837 --> 41:14.404
               Yeah. We're good.

41:55.881 --> 41:58.581
       (thunder rumbling)

42:14.065 --> 42:16.666
                 Hey! (laughs)

42:16.668 --> 42:18.735
                 There's a sight
                 for sore eyes.

42:19.671 --> 42:21.971
             Boy, are they sore.

42:23.475 --> 42:24.807
             Thank you for this.

42:25.810 --> 42:27.076
                  Seriously.

42:29.381 --> 42:32.849
      It was really sweet of you
      to have those little pals
      of yours come over today.

42:32.851 --> 42:35.251
                You have no idea
                what it's like.

42:35.253 --> 42:38.388
              22 hours a day
              in a concrete box,

42:38.390 --> 42:40.823
            never even seeing
            another human being.

42:42.093 --> 42:43.726
       Make you go crazy.

42:46.665 --> 42:49.399
                You know...

42:49.401 --> 42:52.835
  if you're you right...
  and the devil made me do it...

42:53.872 --> 42:55.572
                you gonna get me
                a new trial?

42:55.574 --> 42:57.540
            Not guilty
            by reason of demons?

42:57.542 --> 42:59.309
                (laughs)

43:01.212 --> 43:02.845
I wanted to help you.

43:03.848 --> 43:06.115
            How does it help?

43:06.117 --> 43:10.286
        You save my soul,
        but you walk away
        with a clear conscience.

43:10.288 --> 43:12.989
              Poor, old innocent
              Blake Morreau...

43:15.126 --> 43:18.761
         stuck here for the rest
         of his mortal life
         in this toilet.

43:22.567 --> 43:24.033
            Makes you crazy,
            doesn't it,

43:24.035 --> 43:25.902
             that you didn't see
             it coming?

43:25.904 --> 43:29.205
        All those double dates
        with those pathetic cows
        you set me up with,

43:29.207 --> 43:34.978
           when you knew how bad
           I wanted to stick it
           into your hot wife.

43:34.980 --> 43:36.512
              Oh.

43:37.449 --> 43:39.215
            So hot.

43:41.653 --> 43:43.486
     It got you hard, didn't it,

43:43.488 --> 43:46.422
         knowing how much
         I wanted to fuck Terry?

43:46.424 --> 43:48.958
              And oh, I did want
              to fuck Terr--
 Just stop talking.

43:48.960 --> 43:51.961
         Stop talking.
         Stop talking.

43:51.963 --> 43:53.596
              (muffled sounds)

43:53.598 --> 43:55.965
    Stop. Stop.

Stop. Stop.

44:02.941 --> 44:04.574

44:05.577 --> 44:08.144
     Stop. Please, please.

44:08.146 --> 44:10.580
There you go.
There you go.

44:13.852 --> 44:16.285

44:16.287 --> 44:17.654

44:27.932 --> 44:29.499
