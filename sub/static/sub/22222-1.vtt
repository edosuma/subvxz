WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:03.079
Previously on Farscape.

00:03.171 --> 00:05.753
lam in control of me!

00:06.299 --> 00:08.039
No more, John.

00:08.134 --> 00:10.216
There's no Scorpius here.

00:12.180 --> 00:13.716
You burn Moya?

00:13.806 --> 00:16.013
To save her.
-No!

00:16.100 --> 00:19.592
Crais and Talyn have located
some kind of surgeon.

00:19.687 --> 00:23.020
If it wasn't serious, they
wouldn't have called us.

00:29.614 --> 00:31.024
Hello, Delvian.

00:31.115 --> 00:32.230
(yells)

00:32.325 --> 00:33.735
John Crichton to Scorpius.

00:33.826 --> 00:36.112
Request immediate extraction.

00:36.204 --> 00:38.365
Given no other choices,
I will shoot you down.

00:39.290 --> 00:41.497
Ejecting now!

00:43.127 --> 00:44.742
(yelling)

00:44.837 --> 00:47.123
Aeryn, can you comply?
-Negative.

00:47.215 --> 00:49.126
Aeryn, listen to me.
This is John. It's John.

00:49.217 --> 00:51.128
Yeah, is it really you, John?
-Yes.

00:51.219 --> 00:52.129
The harness is jammed!

00:52.220 --> 00:53.300
Aeryn!

00:53.387 --> 00:57.471
(screaming )'
No!

00:57.558 --> 00:59.890
Oh, God...

00:59.977 --> 01:01.968
What have I done?

01:05.191 --> 01:07.398
At peace, Aeryn.

01:09.028 --> 01:11.895
Remove chip.

01:11.989 --> 01:13.525
Take the damn thing out.

01:13.616 --> 01:15.231
(whirring )

01:18.329 --> 01:19.535
Down there!

01:20.998 --> 01:22.954
Hello, Doctor.

01:23.042 --> 01:25.203
So good to see you again.

01:25.294 --> 01:26.625
You no longer serve a purpose.

01:26.712 --> 01:28.248
( blowing )
( groans )

01:28.339 --> 01:31.627
(speaking gibberish )
-| only hope...

01:31.717 --> 01:35.505
the wormhole technology I've
waited so patiently for makes
more sense.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.712
(speaking gibberish )

01:37.807 --> 01:39.217
Goodbye.

01:42.687 --> 01:45.975
( screaming )

01:47.233 --> 01:49.269
And now on Farscape...

01:49.360 --> 01:51.225
Is there still no communication
from the planet?

01:51.320 --> 01:54.483
Nothing. The Diagnosian said
we would be notified

01:54.573 --> 01:57.189
as soon as there was
something to report.

01:57.285 --> 01:58.900
Pilot, any news?

01:58.995 --> 02:01.202
I would have told you
if there were.

02:01.289 --> 02:03.701
We should be down there
at Crichton's side.

02:03.791 --> 02:06.282
John did not want us there.
We must respect that.

02:06.377 --> 02:09.585
The microt you hear
anything, Pilot.
-Yes, Zhaan.

02:09.672 --> 02:12.709
Crais:
Pilot, I remind you that
we shouldn't stay any longer than necessary.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.007
If the neural clone's messages
got through to Scorpius,

02:15.094 --> 02:17.301
his Command Carrier
must be on its way.

02:17.388 --> 02:19.424
We know that, Crais.

02:19.515 --> 02:21.972
Chiana:
Pilot, have you heard anything?

02:22.059 --> 02:25.347
No! When I know something,
you'll know it.

02:25.438 --> 02:29.272
Until then, leave me alone!

02:29.358 --> 02:31.269
Is he always like that?

02:31.360 --> 02:32.975
Aeryn's death hit him
pretty hard.

02:33.070 --> 02:35.732
Hit everybody hard.

02:39.577 --> 02:41.317
Now why were you hiding,
Grunchlk?

02:41.412 --> 02:45.075
Why do you and your goons
come storming in here with
your guns drawn?

02:45.166 --> 02:46.155
Oh, just a precaution.

02:46.250 --> 02:47.865
Precaution? Well, so was that.

02:47.960 --> 02:53.330
So go on, son. Put your
precautions away and pay me
what we agreed.

02:53.424 --> 02:57.838
Listen, I informed you the
microt that Crichton got here,

02:57.928 --> 03:01.295
so you keep up your end of
the deal, all right?

03:01.390 --> 03:05.474
Listen, son, you don't want to
frell with me on this one!

03:05.561 --> 03:07.176
Grunchlk.

03:07.271 --> 03:11.059
If I was in your situation,
I'd be attempting to
present evidence

03:11.150 --> 03:13.106
that I still served a purpose.

03:13.194 --> 03:14.900
Does he?

03:14.987 --> 03:19.606
Now that my neuro chip has
absorbed the information I need
from John's mind,

03:20.910 --> 03:22.320
we're finished here.

03:22.995 --> 03:25.031
Poor Crichton.

03:25.915 --> 03:28.497
He's going to be so lonely.

03:30.419 --> 03:32.284
Never mind.

03:39.220 --> 03:41.256
(screaming gibberish )

03:52.316 --> 03:53.647
Scorpius:
John.

03:55.403 --> 03:56.518
It's me, John.

03:56.612 --> 03:57.977
I'm still here.

03:58.072 --> 03:59.357
What? No.

03:59.448 --> 04:00.733
No, no, no, no.

04:00.825 --> 04:02.611
You're gone. The chip's gone.

04:02.701 --> 04:04.566
Get out of my head.

04:04.662 --> 04:06.994
I'd like to.

04:07.081 --> 04:10.790
I don't wish to remain here.
Therefore, you must die.

04:18.217 --> 04:21.050
My name is John Crichton...
I'm lost...
an astronaut.

04:21.137 --> 04:24.629
I got shot through a
wormhole... In some distant
part of the universe...

04:24.723 --> 04:26.304
I'm trying to stay alive...

04:26.392 --> 04:28.303
Aboard this ship...
This living ship...

04:28.394 --> 04:31.101
Of escaped prisoners.
My friends.

04:31.188 --> 04:32.644
If you can hear me...
Beware.

04:32.731 --> 04:34.687
If I make it back...
Will they follow?

04:34.775 --> 04:37.482
If I open the door...
Are you ready?

04:37.570 --> 04:42.030
Earth is unprepared...
Helpless, for the nightmares
I've seen.

04:42.116 --> 04:44.198
Or should I stay...
Protect my home...

04:44.285 --> 04:46.992
Not show them...
You exist...

04:47.079 --> 04:50.822
But then you will never know
the wonders I've seen.

05:21.363 --> 05:24.150
Serve a purpose?
Of course, I serve a purpose.

05:24.241 --> 05:26.402
Any purpose you like, sir.

05:26.494 --> 05:27.904
Got a purpose?

05:27.995 --> 05:30.486
No? Well I'll come up with one.

05:30.581 --> 05:32.492
Look, there... there's a
purpose in itself.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.073
Sir.

05:34.168 --> 05:36.284
Officer Kobrin, I ordered you
to remain with the Marauder.

05:36.378 --> 05:41.247
Yes, sir. However we've
received an encoded message
pulse from the Command Carrier.

05:41.342 --> 05:42.206
Oh, report.

05:42.301 --> 05:43.632
Battle ended successfully.

05:43.719 --> 05:45.084
Ahh.

05:45.179 --> 05:47.340
However, the unexpected
duration of the engagement

05:47.431 --> 05:50.764
will delay our rendezvous
5.3 arns.

05:52.311 --> 05:54.347
Five arns...

05:55.606 --> 05:57.722
Crichton's shipmates won't
stay away that long.

05:57.816 --> 05:59.147
We can eliminate them.

05:59.235 --> 06:01.351
They don't worry me.

06:01.445 --> 06:04.187
A Leviathan gunship commanded
by a vengeful traitor does.

06:04.281 --> 06:05.817
Sir, I flew us here undetected.

06:05.908 --> 06:09.275
Because Crais and Talyn
were preoccupied

06:09.370 --> 06:11.656
with Officer Sun's last flight.

06:16.752 --> 06:22.213
If we were to leave now,
how long could you keep
us undetected?

06:22.299 --> 06:25.291
We'd be a thousand metras away
before the gunship detected us.

06:25.386 --> 06:26.967
Not good enough.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.170
The Carrier's still so far off.

06:29.265 --> 06:32.598
Talyn would easily overtake us.

06:32.685 --> 06:34.846
( sighs )
We'll wait.

06:34.937 --> 06:36.427
Ah, ah, if...

06:36.522 --> 06:39.355
If you're thinking of
staying, sir,

06:39.441 --> 06:43.275
I've got a splendid room.
All the comforts.

06:43.362 --> 06:45.944
Very private.

06:48.784 --> 06:50.365
Show us.

06:53.038 --> 06:54.699
Splendid.

06:57.960 --> 07:01.202
(yelling gibberish)

07:01.297 --> 07:03.538
Death is the only sensible
course, John.

07:03.632 --> 07:06.169
For everything there is a
season. A time to be born...

07:06.260 --> 07:07.750
Both:
and a time to die.

07:07.845 --> 07:10.131
Yes, yes, yes.
The devil quotes scripture.

07:10.222 --> 07:12.258
I thought you were put
in here to protect me.

07:12.349 --> 07:14.260
Until my task here
was completed.

07:14.351 --> 07:16.342
Now that Scorpius has
recovered the neuro chip...

07:16.437 --> 07:18.018
You should be gone!

07:18.105 --> 07:20.517
How come you're not?

07:20.608 --> 07:22.519
I don't know, but this...

07:22.610 --> 07:24.475
this is intolerable for
both of us.

07:24.570 --> 07:27.277
End it, John! Free us
from one another!

07:27.364 --> 07:28.740
Scorpius has beaten you.

07:28.824 --> 07:30.234
Aeryn Sun is dead.

07:30.326 --> 07:31.691
Your power of speech is gone.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.650
The only one you'll ever
talk to again is me!

07:33.746 --> 07:35.987
Is that how you want to live?!

07:36.624 --> 07:39.286
End it, John. Do it.

07:41.837 --> 07:43.748
Grunchlk, where are you?

07:43.839 --> 07:46.296
You told me that ship
would be here by now.

07:46.383 --> 07:47.793
Grunchlk!

07:47.885 --> 07:49.876
( muffled shouts )

07:49.970 --> 07:51.050
( shouting )

07:51.138 --> 07:52.218
Oh, Crichton.

07:52.306 --> 07:53.546
(speaking gibberish )

07:53.641 --> 07:55.802
You're even more inarticulate
than you...

07:55.893 --> 07:56.723
(gasps )

07:56.810 --> 07:58.266
Oh.

07:58.354 --> 07:59.935
Tocot?

08:01.440 --> 08:03.726
Zhaan:
We'll come down at once, Rygel.

08:03.817 --> 08:06.308
D'Argo. Hey.
We got a meal ready.

08:06.403 --> 08:09.395
There's a problem.
Zhaan, Stark and I are going
down to the planet.

08:09.490 --> 08:13.028
We'll go with you.
-No, I need you to stay
here with Moya.

08:13.118 --> 08:15.734
Scorpius's Command Carrier
could arrive at any microt.

08:15.829 --> 08:19.071
If it does, I want you to
Starburst away immediately.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.201
But Pilot can look after...
-Just run away and hide...

08:20.292 --> 08:22.328
Do what I tell you!

08:23.128 --> 08:24.334
( growls )

08:24.421 --> 08:25.251
Frell!

08:25.339 --> 08:27.921
I'm frelling sick of this!

08:28.008 --> 08:29.248
And when the services finished,

08:29.343 --> 08:31.129
everyone except Crichton went
back up to their ship,

08:31.220 --> 08:33.176
and the doc, he started
the surgery.

08:33.263 --> 08:35.879
And your last communication
with any of them was when?

08:35.974 --> 08:37.225
Uh... nine or ten arns.

08:37.309 --> 08:39.425
Sir, the Marauder's sensors
have detected a Transport Pod

08:39.520 --> 08:42.728
leaving Moya on a vector
towards us.

08:42.815 --> 08:44.726
They didn't speak to you first?

08:44.817 --> 08:46.353
They must be getting
apprehensive.

08:46.443 --> 08:49.150
Oh, when they get here,
let me speak to 'em.

08:49.238 --> 08:52.275
I'll, uh, I'll stall 'em,
send 'em away,

08:52.366 --> 08:53.355
whatever you want.

08:53.450 --> 08:56.317
I'll... I'll say you
anything you like.

08:56.412 --> 08:58.744
How prescient of you.

08:59.832 --> 09:01.197
( screaming )

09:03.043 --> 09:04.624
( groans )

09:06.505 --> 09:08.245
(gasping)

09:13.929 --> 09:17.046
Yours is an interesting
species, Grunchlk.

09:17.141 --> 09:19.177
Simple mind.

09:20.477 --> 09:22.468
Simple brain.

09:24.940 --> 09:26.646
(gasping)

09:29.361 --> 09:32.353
(groaning)

09:34.199 --> 09:36.110
Easily dominated.

09:42.416 --> 09:44.748
And easily controlled.

10:06.565 --> 10:09.728
(puffing air)

10:12.446 --> 10:14.277
About time!

10:14.364 --> 10:15.615
Keep trying, Rygel.

10:15.699 --> 10:16.654
You try.

10:16.742 --> 10:18.573
I've done everything
you told me.

10:18.660 --> 10:20.400
Turned on the bioneutralizer.

10:20.496 --> 10:22.953
John.
-Turned off the see-through
skull machine.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.746
Enough is enough!
-John

10:24.833 --> 10:26.118
It's just not working!

10:26.210 --> 10:27.290
(coughing)

10:27.377 --> 10:29.584
He's breathing!

10:29.671 --> 10:32.333
Scor... Scorpius.

10:32.424 --> 10:33.880
(coughing)

10:35.469 --> 10:39.257
The Command Carrier couldn't
have arrived without
our knowing.

10:39.348 --> 10:42.465
Scorpius must have come in
a Prowler or a Marauder

10:42.559 --> 10:44.140
on a stealth trajectory.

10:44.228 --> 10:45.217
Could he still be here?

10:45.312 --> 10:46.392
Possibly.

10:46.480 --> 10:50.223
If so, reinforcements
may follow.

10:50.317 --> 10:54.185
Talyn and I will adjust our
orbit for maximum scan.

10:54.279 --> 10:59.490
Splendid room. All the
comforts. Very private.

11:00.744 --> 11:02.200
Splendid room.

11:02.287 --> 11:03.663
All the comf...

11:03.747 --> 11:06.864
(gagging )1
Very priv...

11:06.959 --> 11:08.119
( coughs )

11:08.210 --> 11:09.871
I'll say...
I'll say anything...

11:09.962 --> 11:12.419
I'll say anything you like.

11:12.506 --> 11:15.248
I'll say anything you like.

11:16.051 --> 11:17.507
Well...

11:17.594 --> 11:19.334
with a little diversion.

11:20.931 --> 11:22.467
Braca.

11:22.558 --> 11:26.392
Let me see your pulse pistol.

11:38.699 --> 11:40.360
Splendid.

11:40.450 --> 11:41.701
Hoo!

11:44.288 --> 11:46.324
(grunting)
(inhaling)

11:46.415 --> 11:49.157
(exhales sharply)

11:49.501 --> 11:51.116
Help!

11:53.088 --> 11:56.080
Scorpius... shot me.

11:56.174 --> 11:57.334
Took the chip.

11:57.426 --> 11:58.131
When?

11:58.218 --> 11:59.298
Couple arns ago.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.421
Gone now.

12:00.512 --> 12:01.501
Are you sure he's gone?

12:01.597 --> 12:03.212
Long gone.

12:05.350 --> 12:07.807
Grunchlk, you...

12:07.895 --> 12:10.728
you used these poor beings
as donors.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.975
The doc couldn't operate else.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.808
Crichton didn't want the
operation if it would
harm a donor.

12:15.903 --> 12:20.897
But nobody was harmed.
The doc was only borrowing
some cerebral fluid to top up Crichton's.

12:20.991 --> 12:22.106
They could spare it.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.327
How can they be harmed if
they're already dead?

12:24.411 --> 12:26.367
Yeah.
-They aren't dead.

12:26.455 --> 12:31.324
Well, I mean, they're
effectively dead 'cause they
can't be restored and live.

12:31.418 --> 12:35.036
They're trapped between
two realms. Lost.

12:35.130 --> 12:36.336
Stark!

12:39.176 --> 12:42.339
John needs our help now.

12:43.555 --> 12:46.137
Tocot, what can we do now?

12:46.224 --> 12:49.057
(speaking alien language)

12:49.144 --> 12:52.432
Well, Doc says he could try
and restore his speech

12:52.522 --> 12:58.734
with a neural tissue
transplant, but that would
use up a donor.

12:59.488 --> 13:01.194
You mean, kill.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.657
However you want.

13:02.741 --> 13:05.778
Crichton definitely would
not want that.

13:05.869 --> 13:09.453
Look, it might not even
work anyway.

13:09.539 --> 13:11.325
The doc says this is
so scrambled

13:11.416 --> 13:14.249
he might not be able to
fix no matter what.

13:15.170 --> 13:17.832
If that's the case...

13:17.923 --> 13:19.208
we need to know.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.585
You want me to share
Unity with him?

13:22.469 --> 13:24.130
No, I can't.

13:24.221 --> 13:27.304
The last time I wasn't strong
enough to overcome
Scorpius's evil.

13:27.391 --> 13:29.302
The evil is gone now.

13:32.396 --> 13:36.935
The chip may have been removed,
but the evil may still remain.

13:37.025 --> 13:42.440
If that is true, we still
need to know.

13:46.618 --> 13:48.529
You're not alone now, Zhaan.

14:16.440 --> 14:17.555
(gasps )

14:20.736 --> 14:22.397
Scorpius:
Delvian...

14:23.113 --> 14:23.977
Delvian...

14:24.072 --> 14:25.027
(gasps )

14:25.115 --> 14:27.231
Listen to Crichton.

14:27.659 --> 14:30.150
Hear his pain.

14:30.245 --> 14:32.236
What should we do?
Should we help her
break out of it?

14:32.330 --> 14:34.742
I... I don't know.
-Zhaan!

14:34.833 --> 14:36.619
Crichton:
Go away.

14:36.710 --> 14:39.668
Go away, Zhaan.

14:39.755 --> 14:41.666
There's no point.

14:41.757 --> 14:43.668
Come out of it! Break Unity!

14:43.759 --> 14:45.044
(gasps )

14:45.135 --> 14:46.341
(panting)

14:46.428 --> 14:47.713
Goddess be with him.

14:47.804 --> 14:50.295
The Scorpius clone is
still in his head.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.425
What?

14:51.516 --> 14:53.131
How is that possible?

14:53.226 --> 14:55.308
It didn't work!
Why didn't it work?

14:55.395 --> 14:57.226
What did you do wrong?

14:57.314 --> 15:00.932
They are never gonna
do what's necessary.

15:01.026 --> 15:03.187
You know what has to be done.

15:03.278 --> 15:04.438
We're going to help you, John.

15:04.529 --> 15:06.485
Give me some wornak injectant.

15:06.573 --> 15:10.236
We're going to get that
frelling madman out
of your mind.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.318
I can't see any.

15:12.412 --> 15:17.497
But how about nahbert serum?
It's just as fast and painless.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.372
Tocot:
(speaking alien language)

15:21.463 --> 15:22.873
Zhaan, what are you doing?!
-Zhaan!

15:22.964 --> 15:23.919
Zhaan,no!

15:24.007 --> 15:25.247
Let me go!

15:25.342 --> 15:26.297
Hold her, Stark.

15:26.384 --> 15:27.840
Crichton wants to die!
-Hold her!

15:27.928 --> 15:30.761
(yelling gibberish)
No! Zhaan stop this!

15:30.847 --> 15:32.508
He wants to die!

15:32.599 --> 15:35.807
Be calm! Be calm!

15:35.894 --> 15:38.806
John is in agony.
He begged me to kill him.

15:38.897 --> 15:40.603
We have already lost Aeryn.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.430
We will not lose another.

15:42.526 --> 15:45.188
Why is Scorpius still in
Crichton's mind?

15:45.278 --> 15:48.236
(speaking alien language)

15:48.323 --> 15:51.235
Well, the doc figures it's
like a neural bleed.

15:51.326 --> 15:55.160
The, ah, clone's personality's
has been in there so long

15:55.247 --> 15:58.205
that his consciousness has,
like, merged with Crichton's.

15:58.291 --> 16:01.078
H-h-how interesting.

16:01.670 --> 16:03.285
Just remove it.

16:03.380 --> 16:05.120
(speaking alien language)

16:05.215 --> 16:07.171
Well, it's...
it's not that easy.

16:07.259 --> 16:10.171
You can'tjust cut it out
with a scalpel, sir.

16:10.262 --> 16:12.218
There's only one merciful
thing to do.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.216
Yeah. I would have to agree.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.808
All right, you two. Out!

16:15.892 --> 16:17.268
Eh?!

16:17.352 --> 16:19.718
Get out! And do not come back
into this chamber.

16:19.813 --> 16:20.723
Right.

16:20.814 --> 16:22.805
Come on, girl.

16:26.903 --> 16:28.985
What shall we do?

16:29.072 --> 16:31.313
Whatever we can.

16:32.868 --> 16:34.199
You.

16:34.286 --> 16:35.492
Restore his speech.

16:35.579 --> 16:38.662
Doctor:
But Crichton insisted...

16:38.748 --> 16:42.206
no harm to donor...

16:42.294 --> 16:44.956
You're the one harming
the donors!

16:45.046 --> 16:48.834
Their souls are crying out,
screaming out in pain!

16:49.217 --> 16:50.957
No pain.

16:51.052 --> 16:53.259
I can hear them!

16:54.347 --> 16:56.383
Effectively dead.

16:56.474 --> 16:58.385
That isn't death at all.

16:58.476 --> 17:00.137
This...

17:00.228 --> 17:01.308
( screams )

17:01.396 --> 17:04.058
(yelling gibberish)

17:05.483 --> 17:07.223
And that...

17:07.319 --> 17:09.150
that was mercy.

17:09.237 --> 17:12.400
His agony was far greater
than yours.

17:13.700 --> 17:17.158
Now, my friend.
Can you help John?

17:17.454 --> 17:19.820
Can try.

17:19.915 --> 17:21.121
Well, go ahead.

17:21.208 --> 17:22.197
(speaking gibberish )

17:22.292 --> 17:24.203
And as for you...

17:24.294 --> 17:26.080
do not...

17:26.171 --> 17:29.083
make me tongue you.

17:29.174 --> 17:31.165
You look pretty rounched.

17:31.259 --> 17:33.090
I need air. I will go outside
and meditate.

17:33.178 --> 17:35.260
Yeah, now, the weather's cold.
Getting worse.

17:35.347 --> 17:36.962
Cold does not bother me.

17:37.057 --> 17:39.218
Crais:
Pa'u Zhaan, anything to report?

17:40.352 --> 17:42.468
Not yet, Crais.

17:42.562 --> 17:45.895
Still in orbit? Go chase
that bastard Scorpius.

17:45.982 --> 17:47.392
Their trail is cold.

17:47.484 --> 17:50.351
Talyn and l have found nothing
to suggest a vector.

17:50.445 --> 17:51.901
So? What are you doing
here, then?

17:51.988 --> 17:55.822
We await the delivery of the
remains of Officer Sun.

17:55.909 --> 17:58.867
For the burial in space she
would have wanted.

17:58.954 --> 18:02.572
Fine. I'll load her coffin onto
your Transport Pod

18:02.666 --> 18:05.328
and, uh, Zhaan can bring
her up to ya.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.579
I cannot face such a
task right now.

18:07.671 --> 18:12.040
Help me out, eh? I'm trying to
get rid of that yarbo and his
gunship from my planet.

18:12.133 --> 18:14.215
I don't trust 'em.

18:16.263 --> 18:20.131
When we all leave, we will
take Aeryn Sun with us.

18:22.852 --> 18:25.434
Huh. If you all leave.

18:27.399 --> 18:28.605
I thought you weren't hungry.

18:30.694 --> 18:32.104
You want some?
-No.

18:32.195 --> 18:33.480
Come on. It will put color
in your cheek.

18:33.571 --> 18:34.856
No.

18:34.948 --> 18:38.156
Come on. We'll die of boredom
but we'll be well fed.

18:38.243 --> 18:41.735
( snarls )
(giggles )
What did you do that for?

18:43.206 --> 18:44.821
I don't know.

18:44.916 --> 18:47.453
Think.

18:47.544 --> 18:49.580
Well, maybe I don't like
being taken care of.

18:49.671 --> 18:51.161
Maybe I don't like
being bitten.

18:51.256 --> 18:53.212
Yeah, well, then keep your
hands out of my face.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.255
Keep your hands out of my food.

18:54.342 --> 18:55.331
Hey, I helped make that!

18:55.427 --> 18:57.008
Too bad!

19:00.265 --> 19:01.425
Still bored?

19:01.516 --> 19:03.131
Stop it!

19:03.852 --> 19:05.558
(giggIeS)

19:08.565 --> 19:09.600
You better...

19:09.691 --> 19:11.181
( panting ):
You better let go.

19:11.276 --> 19:12.140
Otherwise, I...

19:12.235 --> 19:13.771
I'm going to have to bite
something else.

19:13.862 --> 19:16.148
You'll lose an arm.

19:18.074 --> 19:21.441
You'll lose worse than an arm.

19:23.997 --> 19:26.329
You wouldn't do that...

19:28.752 --> 19:30.959
Don't tell me what I...

19:31.046 --> 19:33.662
what I would or wouldn't do...

19:34.716 --> 19:37.332
I do as I please.

19:38.595 --> 19:40.426
Okay.

19:41.181 --> 19:43.388
Do whatever you want.

19:46.811 --> 19:48.893
(electronic beeping )

19:51.316 --> 19:53.147
Done.

19:53.234 --> 19:56.146
Damage repaired.

19:56.237 --> 19:59.400
Speech should return.

19:59.491 --> 20:00.776
Should?

20:00.867 --> 20:03.825
Will know soon.

20:06.122 --> 20:07.407
Hey where are you going?

20:07.499 --> 20:09.990
M ust excrete.

20:10.085 --> 20:11.950
D... D...

20:14.297 --> 20:15.833
D'Argo.

20:17.592 --> 20:20.129
Aeryn's gone.

20:20.220 --> 20:22.427
I want to die.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.009
Aeryn died so that you
could live, John.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.391
She would want you to
keep fighting.

20:31.272 --> 20:32.978
Crichton:
Lost.

20:34.692 --> 20:36.853
Still hear Scorpy...

20:36.945 --> 20:38.185
Listen to me.

20:38.279 --> 20:39.610
The chip's out.

20:39.697 --> 20:41.312
Its tendrils are dead.

20:41.408 --> 20:43.524
The Scorpy in your head
is merely a remnant,

20:43.618 --> 20:47.236
a... an... impudent wraith
buzzing in your ear.

20:47.330 --> 20:50.163
You are stronger than he is.
Show him.

20:58.216 --> 21:00.332
Hey, Harvey.
Let's have a little chat.

21:00.427 --> 21:02.418
I don't wish to chat, John.
I wish to leave.

21:02.512 --> 21:03.752
That is why you must die.

21:03.847 --> 21:05.803
Why don't you kill me?
You did it before.

21:05.890 --> 21:07.266
Stopped my brain function cold.

21:07.350 --> 21:08.465
What's the matter?
You lost your touch?

21:08.560 --> 21:10.676
Circumstances are
different now.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.226
Yes, they are.

21:12.313 --> 21:15.726
You got no connections,
no backup, no power supply.

21:15.817 --> 21:18.684
No place to hide.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.314
I wanna make some rules now.

21:20.405 --> 21:23.112
Come on. Let me show you
what I mean.

21:37.297 --> 21:39.788
Now John, you listen to me.

21:39.883 --> 21:40.998
Not this time, Scorpius.

21:41.092 --> 21:43.174
Brain ain't big enough
for the two of us.

21:44.220 --> 21:46.211
Look Crichton,
I'm warning you...

21:46.306 --> 21:48.342
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

21:49.851 --> 21:52.058
Come on, Scorpy. Come on, man.

21:52.145 --> 21:53.885
Show me that ugly grin.

21:55.231 --> 21:57.142
I'm warning you, Crichton.

21:57.233 --> 21:58.939
Now, you stop.

21:59.027 --> 22:01.814
Oh, no, no, no, no, I don't
think so, remember?

22:01.905 --> 22:04.567
Out with the old,
in with the new!

22:08.203 --> 22:10.489
Can I get a hell yeah?!

22:10.580 --> 22:13.447
Crowd:
Hell yeah!

22:13.541 --> 22:15.327
It's your time to pray, Scorpy.

22:18.379 --> 22:19.835
Oh, Crichton.

22:20.715 --> 22:22.546
Pray for your soul, Scorpy.

22:22.634 --> 22:24.124
If you have one.

22:24.219 --> 22:26.335
And pray for the soul
of Aeryn Sun!

22:36.314 --> 22:37.554
Crichton!

22:37.649 --> 22:39.014
Shut up.

22:41.528 --> 22:42.813
Yeah!

22:42.904 --> 22:45.520
( crowd cheers )

22:48.409 --> 22:49.364
Whoo!

22:52.247 --> 22:54.033
( muttering softly )

22:57.961 --> 23:00.293
( Doctor speaking alien
language over radio)

23:00.380 --> 23:05.249
One of the cryogenic pods is
starting an autorelease
sequence,eh?

23:05.343 --> 23:07.800
Uh, nah. Can't be.

23:07.887 --> 23:10.173
Let me talk to him.

23:12.100 --> 23:14.136
(speaking alien language)

23:14.227 --> 23:15.933
Sorry, Doc. Say again?

23:16.020 --> 23:18.181
(speaking alien language)

23:18.273 --> 23:21.731
Full restoration? You sure?

23:21.818 --> 23:25.561
Nah. Nah, I-it must be a
screwed-up sensor.

23:25.655 --> 23:28.863
Ha... no. You get back and
tend your patient, doc.

23:28.950 --> 23:30.190
l'll deal with it.

23:30.285 --> 23:31.900
(speaking alien language)

23:31.995 --> 23:35.579
Doc, leave it to me.

23:35.665 --> 23:36.780
(speaking alien language)

23:36.874 --> 23:38.580
Doc, get out of there.

23:42.088 --> 23:44.170
l'll handle it!

23:44.257 --> 23:45.997
Doc? Doc!

23:46.092 --> 23:47.332
(doctor gasps)

23:48.386 --> 23:50.297
(moaning)

24:10.742 --> 24:14.360
A Scarran? Here? Why?

24:14.871 --> 24:16.987
( groans )

24:17.081 --> 24:18.366
Get frelled.

24:21.586 --> 24:23.247
Grunchlk.

24:23.338 --> 24:26.045
You can do one of two things
with your mouth.

24:27.508 --> 24:29.760
The first is talk to me.

24:34.849 --> 24:36.430
(gasping)

24:41.648 --> 24:43.388
( crunch )

24:49.781 --> 24:52.363
( screaming )

24:54.869 --> 24:58.327
( screaming )

24:58.414 --> 25:00.450
And that is the second.

25:00.541 --> 25:03.157
All right.

25:03.252 --> 25:07.291
You know the Scarrans
are after you.

25:07.382 --> 25:13.673
They found out this is
where you had your cooling
system installed.

25:13.763 --> 25:19.633
And they sent a spy who offered
me currency to keep him hidden

25:19.727 --> 25:22.514
till you came back
for a checkup.

25:22.605 --> 25:24.106
And you took his money.

25:25.775 --> 25:27.561
Just his advance.

25:27.652 --> 25:33.067
I was going to keep the dumb
frell frozen and hand
him over to you.

25:33.157 --> 25:34.818
But you didn't.

25:34.909 --> 25:37.321
When your goons came in
locked and loaded,

25:37.412 --> 25:40.199
I kind of doubted your
good intentions.

25:40.289 --> 25:47.001
As insurance, I switched on the
Scarran's auto release, three
arns delay.

25:47.088 --> 25:52.299
If you'd behaved, and paid
what we'd agreed,

25:52.385 --> 25:55.001
I'd have switched it off.

25:57.181 --> 26:02.392
I hope he kills you
very slowly.

26:03.229 --> 26:05.345
Not likely.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.934
If my father finds out,
we're dead.
-He won't find out.

26:11.028 --> 26:14.020
What the hezmana happened
in here?

26:14.949 --> 26:17.031
Oh, we were...

26:17.118 --> 26:18.324
we were making some...

26:18.411 --> 26:20.242
some sork wings and...

26:20.329 --> 26:21.785
and the pot exploded.

26:21.873 --> 26:23.659
You blew up a cook pot?

26:23.750 --> 26:25.240
We used too much Iutra oil.

26:25.334 --> 26:27.290
The grolack's fine, though.

26:27.879 --> 26:29.585
Nice and crispy.

26:29.672 --> 26:30.502
Here.

26:30.590 --> 26:31.875
Sit down and eat.

26:31.966 --> 26:33.331
Ah, I'll give the...

26:33.426 --> 26:35.508
ah, I'll give the sork wings
another try.

26:35.595 --> 26:40.589
I'll, uh... consume this
in a room without
detonating crockery.

26:40.683 --> 26:42.639
Thank you very much.

26:51.402 --> 26:54.189
We'd better clean this up.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.316
I guess so.

26:59.410 --> 27:02.902
Crichton, D'Argo and Stark are
in the surgery room.

27:02.997 --> 27:05.864
Now the Scarran is in the
cryo-chamber, level four.

27:05.958 --> 27:07.949
Shall I take care of it, sir?

27:09.086 --> 27:10.246
With that?

27:10.338 --> 27:12.670
He'll saute you, son.

27:12.757 --> 27:16.170
He's never taken on
a Scarran, has he?

27:16.260 --> 27:17.670
No.

27:19.305 --> 27:20.966
Have you?

27:21.891 --> 27:23.381
(gasping)

27:24.101 --> 27:25.227
I beat him.

27:25.311 --> 27:27.552
He was all mouth, Stark.
How'd you know?

27:27.647 --> 27:31.231
I didn't. Ijust thought
it sounded good.

27:31.317 --> 27:33.353
Well, it worked.
Harvey's caged.

27:33.444 --> 27:35.275
Come on, let's pay the bill and
get the hell out of here.

27:35.363 --> 27:37.069
I will find Zhaan.

27:38.783 --> 27:40.944
Plonek!

27:41.744 --> 27:44.827
Ithrawan Plonek!

27:46.332 --> 27:48.618
I'm alone!

27:50.253 --> 27:52.995
I got a present for you!

27:54.298 --> 27:55.959
(guttural grunt)
Ooh!

27:56.050 --> 28:00.293
Grunchlk, where is Scorpius?

28:00.763 --> 28:02.469
He's not here.

28:02.557 --> 28:05.048
Then why did you release me?

28:05.142 --> 28:08.179
Well, I... I... I've... I've
got someone almost as good.

28:08.271 --> 28:10.853
John Crichton.

28:10.940 --> 28:12.350
Do you know who that is?

28:12.441 --> 28:13.476
Yes.

28:13.568 --> 28:16.605
Scorpius seems obsessed
with him.

28:16.696 --> 28:18.482
We want to know why.

28:18.573 --> 28:19.688
Why don't you ask him?

28:19.782 --> 28:22.649
He's in the surgery
room recovering.

28:22.743 --> 28:25.075
No! No! Ohh!

28:25.162 --> 28:28.450
Are you lying? Is this a trap?

28:28.541 --> 28:31.078
No, no, no. No trap.

28:31.168 --> 28:33.875
Where is Scorpius?

28:33.963 --> 28:35.328
Scorpius isn't here.

28:35.423 --> 28:37.414
Scorpius isn't here,
I told you.

28:37.508 --> 28:40.671
But I'm sure he's on his way
back to the planet

28:40.761 --> 28:42.888
to capture Crichton.
-to capture Crichton.

28:43.472 --> 28:45.679
Who is with Crichton?

28:45.766 --> 28:49.509
Just a Luxan and the
Banik slave.

28:50.605 --> 28:52.516
(gasping)

28:54.901 --> 28:58.393
I might have use for you later.

29:02.033 --> 29:04.240
( screaming )

29:05.369 --> 29:07.234
( screaming )

29:12.835 --> 29:15.326
That should divert the Scarran
away from us.

29:16.964 --> 29:19.376
Officer Kobrin,

29:19.467 --> 29:21.674
we've received vital
information

29:21.761 --> 29:23.422
which I must deliver to my
Command Carrier.

29:23.512 --> 29:26.003
Sir, the carrier is
now much closer.

29:26.098 --> 29:29.841
I am certain we can outrun
the gunship long enough
to reach it safely.

29:29.936 --> 29:32.973
You have that much faith in
your piloting skills?

29:33.064 --> 29:36.181
My last rating was 991, sir.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.652
No active pilot rates higher.

29:40.988 --> 29:43.445
Your skills will be tested,

29:43.532 --> 29:45.614
very soon.

29:48.704 --> 29:50.660
Zhaan:
Stark, look at these indicators.

29:50.748 --> 29:53.615
The cryo-system is activated to
preserve the body until burial.

29:53.709 --> 29:57.293
But that's not all. The
cellular maintenance functions
are still operating

29:57.380 --> 29:59.336
keeping her body alive.

29:59.423 --> 30:01.334
Why?

30:01.425 --> 30:05.088
Unless Grunchlk was intending
to keep her here as a donor.

30:05.179 --> 30:07.545
I wouldn't put it past him.

30:07.640 --> 30:10.177
No, the Diagnosian
pronounced her dead.

30:10.267 --> 30:11.723
He could not save her.

30:11.811 --> 30:14.052
His gifts could not.

30:21.570 --> 30:24.061
I could hear the distant
voices of the Interons,

30:24.156 --> 30:28.320
but I cannot hear Aeryn Sun's.

30:28.411 --> 30:32.450
If her soul has not fled
entirely it's much too far
away to be reached.

30:32.540 --> 30:35.407
Even the attempt would
be dangerous.

30:36.252 --> 30:38.493
Yes, you're probably right.

30:47.972 --> 30:50.805
Peter Piper picked a peck
of pickled peppers.
-Zhaan. Stark!

30:51.934 --> 30:54.016
Why don't they answer?

30:54.103 --> 30:56.515
Zhaan? Stark?

30:58.399 --> 31:00.390
What's the delay?

31:09.285 --> 31:10.525
D'Argo!

31:12.371 --> 31:14.157
Where the hell did
that come from?

31:14.248 --> 31:15.408
A Scarran.

31:15.499 --> 31:18.115
We have no weapons so I
suggest a tactical retreat.

31:18.210 --> 31:19.791
That looks like an exit.

31:20.212 --> 31:21.952
Door controls.

31:24.300 --> 31:25.289
You didn't bring any weapons?

31:25.384 --> 31:27.670
I only brought down my
Qualta Blade.

31:27.762 --> 31:29.377
It's still sealed.

31:29.472 --> 31:31.178
Well, how am I supposed
to know about that?

31:31.265 --> 31:33.347
Wait! There's a hatch.

31:33.434 --> 31:35.220
Whoa!

31:35.311 --> 31:37.723
I hate the cold.

31:38.439 --> 31:40.304
Freeze or fry.

31:42.902 --> 31:44.062
Freeze.

31:52.661 --> 31:55.994
Sir, the diversion's working.

31:56.082 --> 31:58.494
The Scarran is moving outside in
pursuit of Crichton and D'Argo.

31:58.584 --> 32:02.998
However, two of the others
are now blocking our path
to the surface.

32:04.632 --> 32:08.170
If they see us and
notify Crais.

32:08.260 --> 32:11.127
Two Commandos from the Marauder
coming from this approach

32:11.222 --> 32:14.430
could take them out and still
maintain a zero-presence
profile.

32:16.310 --> 32:18.141
Summon them.

32:25.361 --> 32:27.727
No sign of the Scarran.
Do you think he's following?

32:27.822 --> 32:30.063
Better hope he is.
-Sounds like you got a plan.

32:30.157 --> 32:34.321
We're going to bring him out
here and see how he likes
being in the cold.

32:34.411 --> 32:35.241
And what if he likes it?

32:35.329 --> 32:38.662
Look! One plan at a time!

32:38.749 --> 32:40.205
All right.

32:42.294 --> 32:46.378
Forgive me, Stark, but I
need your strength.

32:46.465 --> 32:49.753
I knew you would never
allow me to risk this.

33:32.970 --> 33:34.835
Do you know who I am?

33:42.104 --> 33:43.685
Do you know who you are?

33:45.816 --> 33:49.183
Officer Aeryn Sun,
Special Peacekeeper Commando,

33:49.278 --> 33:52.395
Icarian Company,
Pleisar Regiment.

33:55.242 --> 33:57.278
Have you come to reassign me?

33:58.662 --> 34:01.244
I've come to take you back.

34:24.313 --> 34:29.057
Zhaan, what is this?

34:29.151 --> 34:31.233
Unity, Aeryn.

34:31.320 --> 34:33.436
The sharing of minds and souls.

34:33.530 --> 34:36.897
As our thoughts merge,
you will understand.

34:36.992 --> 34:40.280
I understand that you
shouldn't be here.

34:40.371 --> 34:42.578
Nor should you.

34:42.665 --> 34:45.247
Why are you doing this?

34:45.334 --> 34:47.245
Because I love you.

34:47.336 --> 34:50.419
More importantly,
Crichton loves you.

34:52.174 --> 34:56.543
You must take this gift,
not for my sake, but for his.

34:56.637 --> 34:58.593
I can't.

34:58.681 --> 35:01.138
I know your thoughts.

35:01.225 --> 35:03.591
And I know what this
will cost you.

35:04.395 --> 35:06.602
Stop resisting, Aeryn.

35:07.439 --> 35:08.645
Accept this.

35:08.732 --> 35:10.108
No.

35:12.236 --> 35:13.521
No!

35:13.612 --> 35:15.227
Aeryn!

35:23.998 --> 35:25.408
We'll take Stark with us.

35:25.499 --> 35:26.955
Capture or terminate?

35:27.042 --> 35:28.748
Braca:
Keep the Banik alive.

35:28.836 --> 35:30.622
Terminate the Delvian.

35:35.050 --> 35:36.586
(sighs)

35:45.728 --> 35:48.390
You're back. You're back.

35:49.231 --> 35:51.938
Oh, Zhaan.

35:52.026 --> 35:54.688
Success.
-Success.

35:54.778 --> 35:56.484
Where are the others?

35:56.572 --> 35:57.937
Surgery.

36:02.870 --> 36:04.781
Repon.

36:04.872 --> 36:09.161
The Commandos are dead,
Lieutenant.

36:09.251 --> 36:13.369
Even if Crais is now aware of
our presence the Scarran won't
stay diverted forever.

36:13.464 --> 36:15.204
Officer Kobrin.

36:16.216 --> 36:17.717
We can wait no longer.

36:17.801 --> 36:19.132
Yes, sir.

36:26.435 --> 36:28.346
Here he comes!

36:28.437 --> 36:31.144
I don't think he likes
the cold either!

36:33.150 --> 36:36.233
Warm up the hot cocoa, baby.
Here we come.

36:36.320 --> 36:39.812
It's jammed!
I can't believe this!

36:40.991 --> 36:44.358
You have got to be kidding me!

36:48.082 --> 36:49.288
Unjam it.

36:49.375 --> 36:51.707
What? What are you gonna do?

36:52.252 --> 36:54.208
(roaring)

36:56.423 --> 36:57.629
Frell.

37:03.430 --> 37:04.966
Yes, Talyn.

37:05.057 --> 37:07.139
I see it.

37:07.226 --> 37:09.763
That is a vessel leaving
the planet.

37:09.853 --> 37:15.564
No, a Transport Pod would
not be attempting a
stealth trajectory.

37:17.945 --> 37:19.401
Pursue.

37:33.419 --> 37:34.750
That's my Qualta blade.

37:34.837 --> 37:37.123
Can't be, you left it
in the coffin!

37:42.302 --> 37:45.294
Hey! Hey, horse face!

37:50.018 --> 37:52.179
(agonized groan )

38:16.753 --> 38:18.129
D'Argo.

38:19.381 --> 38:20.461
No! You're gone.

38:20.549 --> 38:21.413
It's me, John.

38:21.508 --> 38:23.123
But it can't be you.

38:23.218 --> 38:25.129
This is some kind of a trick.

38:25.220 --> 38:26.130
She died.

38:26.221 --> 38:27.802
Zhaan brought me back.

38:27.890 --> 38:30.176
She did a Unity thing.

38:30.267 --> 38:31.473
Zhaan.

38:35.063 --> 38:36.223
Zhaan?

38:39.443 --> 38:41.024
You're alive.

38:49.161 --> 38:51.903
Scorpius:
Crais, cease this pursuit
at once.

38:51.997 --> 38:54.409
This pursuit will end in
your death, Scorpius.

38:54.500 --> 38:58.163
Aboard this Marauder is
information that will help us
defeat the Scarrans.

38:58.253 --> 39:01.916
You may have foresworn the
Peacekeepers, but before
you act,

39:02.007 --> 39:03.543
consider your fellow Sebaceans.

39:03.634 --> 39:08.253
You consider one Sebacean
who died at your hands,
Officer Aeryn Sun.

39:12.017 --> 39:13.723
Crais:
Yes, Talyn, I see it.

39:13.810 --> 39:15.220
Command Carrier.

39:15.312 --> 39:17.519
Scorpius:
Crais, you destroy this ship,

39:17.606 --> 39:19.938
and my Command Carrier
will destroy you.

39:20.025 --> 39:20.980
Possibly.

39:21.068 --> 39:23.184
Talyn! Are we in agreement?!

39:24.279 --> 39:25.485
Fire!

39:30.869 --> 39:32.370
Pilot...

39:33.413 --> 39:36.450
Scorpius is dead.

39:36.542 --> 39:38.999
His Command Carrier is now
in pursuit of Talyn.

39:39.086 --> 39:42.203
We'll draw it away from your
position before we Starburst.

39:42.297 --> 39:45.164
Scorpius is dead?

39:45.259 --> 39:46.465
Yes.

39:47.594 --> 39:51.007
Officer Sun is avenged.

39:53.392 --> 39:54.302
Are you certain, Pilot?

39:54.393 --> 39:56.884
Yes. Moya confirms it.

39:56.979 --> 40:02.975
Before Starbursting, Talyn told
her that he destroyed
Scorpius's Marauder.

40:03.068 --> 40:04.524
Damn shame on two counts.

40:04.611 --> 40:06.943
Too quick, and I wasn't
there to see it.

40:07.030 --> 40:08.406
Stark:
D'Argo, I'm with Zhaan.

40:08.490 --> 40:10.355
Did you find Tocot?

40:10.450 --> 40:13.362
Yes. He's dead.

40:14.246 --> 40:16.077
And what about Grunchlk?

40:16.164 --> 40:17.950
He's dead, too.

40:18.542 --> 40:20.578
Effectively.

40:21.962 --> 40:23.702
Then we're gonna take
these two with us.

40:23.797 --> 40:24.786
D'Argo:
The Interons?

40:24.881 --> 40:26.621
Aeryn:
Why?

40:26.717 --> 40:28.048
One of them died because of me.

40:28.135 --> 40:30.342
What, and you think they can be
saved?

40:31.138 --> 40:32.298
You were.

40:52.409 --> 40:55.276
A signal from the Command
Carrier, sir.

40:55.370 --> 40:58.237
Moya and Talyn have both fled.

40:58.332 --> 41:00.493
A Prowler detail is on its
way to pick us up.

41:00.584 --> 41:03.747
The Marauder?
-Destroyed.

41:03.837 --> 41:07.170
Plainly Officer Kobrin
overestimated his
piloting skills.

41:07.257 --> 41:10.374
Well, perhaps Talyn is more
formidable than we thought.

41:10.469 --> 41:12.084
Sir, Crais must be...

41:12.179 --> 41:14.636
First Command has already taken
care of that situation.

41:14.723 --> 41:17.135
Our task is much
more important.

41:17.225 --> 41:21.594
We have a new Gammak Research
Base ready to go into
operation.

41:21.688 --> 41:24.521
Hundreds of techs,
all waiting to apply this...

41:27.361 --> 41:29.522
priceless information.

41:30.822 --> 41:33.564
Let's not keep them
waiting, Lieutenant.

41:44.086 --> 41:45.701
Taste all right?

41:45.796 --> 41:49.914
That frelling planet got me so
chilled I still can't smell
anything, but...

41:50.008 --> 41:52.169
it is warming me up.

41:52.260 --> 41:54.216
Rygel:
Mine is more than adequate.

41:54.304 --> 41:57.262
All the time you two
spent in here was...

41:57.349 --> 42:00.056
ultimately productive.

42:00.143 --> 42:02.429
Two excellent cooks.

42:04.356 --> 42:05.721
I couldn't be luckier.

42:05.816 --> 42:06.976
Rygel:
Well, I could.

42:07.067 --> 42:09.103
That frelling Grunchlk.

42:09.194 --> 42:11.901
I paid for services and
they were not rendered.

42:11.988 --> 42:13.979
I'm delighted he's dead.

42:31.675 --> 42:33.916
Finished making your rounds?

42:35.220 --> 42:36.801
Mm-hmm.

42:40.684 --> 42:43.221
I shouldn't be here.

42:43.311 --> 42:45.927
This is exactly where
you should be.

42:48.233 --> 42:49.689
I love you.

42:52.904 --> 42:54.690
I love you, too.

43:28.231 --> 43:30.438
We will not act on it.

43:31.693 --> 43:32.978
Aeryn?

43:33.069 --> 43:36.027
My Peacekeeper training was
right about one thing.

43:36.114 --> 43:42.952
Soldiers and emotional
attachments in battle may
distort your thinking.

43:43.038 --> 43:45.199
We're not in battle, Aeryn.
Scorpius is...

43:45.290 --> 43:49.579
What happens... What happens
when Moya comes into contact
with more Scarrans?

43:49.669 --> 43:51.580
Or Nebari or Sheyangs
or something worse?

43:51.671 --> 43:56.631
I will not be the cause of
any more deaths because my
judgment was faulty.

43:56.718 --> 44:02.008
I will not permit anyone
else to sacrifice their
life for mine.

44:05.602 --> 44:08.435
What do you mean, anyone else?

44:16.571 --> 44:18.653
Hello, John.

44:20.325 --> 44:23.943
Aeryn just told me that, uh...

44:24.037 --> 44:25.902
whatever you did to
bring her back...

44:25.997 --> 44:28.158
A gift of spiritual energy.

44:28.250 --> 44:30.241
Yes.

44:30.335 --> 44:32.371
And it took everything
that you had.

44:37.300 --> 44:39.461
Is there anything we
can do to help?

44:40.011 --> 44:41.262
Nothing.

44:44.224 --> 44:46.385
I will not accept that.

44:46.476 --> 44:48.307
I have, John.

44:50.355 --> 44:52.220
I'm dying.
