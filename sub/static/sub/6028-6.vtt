WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:05.439
Will all the remaining passengers
for the Express to London Victoria...

00:05.520 --> 00:07.919
... please make their way
to A3.

00:10.800 --> 00:12.599
Please remain in the terminal.

00:17.840 --> 00:19.479
Bless you.

00:19.560 --> 00:23.319
- Sorry. He's got a touch of flu.
- Yeah, it's going round.

00:25.360 --> 00:28.439
Here we are, here you go.
Just have a little lie-down.

00:28.520 --> 00:30.239
That's it, yeah?

00:32.320 --> 00:36.439
- Are you going somewhere nice?
- Just getting away for a bit.

00:36.520 --> 00:38.679
Somewhere
no-one can find me.

00:38.760 --> 00:41.079
God, that sounds great.

00:41.160 --> 00:42.799
We're off on holiday.

00:42.880 --> 00:45.919
- To the south of France.
- Oh, nice.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.959
It's a long way by coach.

00:48.040 --> 00:49.359
I know.

00:49.440 --> 00:52.079
It's just, you know...

00:53.280 --> 00:56.719
- ... the environment.
- Yes, we should all think of that.

00:56.800 --> 00:59.679
I don't want to sound like a twat,
but I just...

01:00.320 --> 01:03.079
You know, I do think
that we've all got a responsibility.

01:03.160 --> 01:06.959
- I just do.
- No, you're right, we do. We all do.

01:09.400 --> 01:12.159
- Why did you have him, then?
- Sorry?

01:12.240 --> 01:16.119
Nothing uses carbon like a first-world human.
Yet you created one.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.719
Why?
Why would you do that?

01:20.120 --> 01:24.639
He will produce 515 tonnes
of carbon in his lifetime.

01:24.720 --> 01:27.159
That's 40 trucks' worth.

01:27.720 --> 01:32.159
Having him was the equivalent
of nearly 6,500 flights to Paris.

01:32.240 --> 01:36.039
You could have flown 90 times a year,
there and back...

01:36.120 --> 01:37.799
... nearly every week
of your life...

01:37.880 --> 01:41.559
... and still not had the same impact
on the planet as his birth had.

01:41.640 --> 01:45.079
- Yeah, but I don't think...
- Not to mention the pesticides, detergents...

01:45.160 --> 01:50.599
... the huge quantity of plastics,
the nuclear fuels used to keep him warm.

01:50.680 --> 01:53.439
His birth was a selfish act.

01:54.160 --> 01:55.439
It was brutal.

01:55.520 --> 01:58.479
You have condemned others
to suffering.

01:58.560 --> 02:01.319
In fact,
if you really cared...

02:01.400 --> 02:05.799
... what you'd do
is cut his throat open right now.

02:05.880 --> 02:08.999
- Excuse me?
- Or I could do it for you.

02:09.080 --> 02:11.279
I could take out my knife...

02:11.360 --> 02:14.599
... make an incision in his neck,
walk away.

02:15.480 --> 02:17.159
I'd get my coach
over there...

02:17.240 --> 02:21.039
... and you would have done more than
your bit for the future of humanity.

02:21.120 --> 02:22.959
I could do it now.

02:29.320 --> 02:33.359
But look at me chatting.
I think they're about to leave.

02:34.400 --> 02:36.959
I hope he gets over
that flu.

02:38.480 --> 02:41.039
But maybe he just shouldn't.

02:54.240 --> 02:57.679
They are sleeper agents.
Trained. Brainwashed.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.999
If I am chosen,
I will receive a call.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.919
I will go to a car park in Denham.
A car will be waiting.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.799
Inside is an extremely deadly
variant of Russian influenza.

03:05.880 --> 03:09.159
Tell Geoff to announce V Day.
Everything's going to be fine.

03:09.240 --> 03:10.919
They know.
So, we have to pay.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.359
- 20 million in cash is large.
- A year's worth of Thoraxin, Becky.

03:15.440 --> 03:17.679
It's not a cure,
but it's taking care of the symptoms.

03:17.760 --> 03:19.279
Eat my fucking chip!

03:20.800 --> 03:24.719
You turned me into a ghost.
What if I did the same to you?

03:25.200 --> 03:27.799
Run, Jessica! Please!

03:27.880 --> 03:30.039
Janus stops the vaccine
from working.

03:30.120 --> 03:31.039
- No, that's not...
- Listen to me.

03:31.120 --> 03:33.839
The flu vaccine we have
is practically useless.

03:33.920 --> 03:36.799
- Commence.
- Call him back now! Stop him!

03:36.880 --> 03:40.719
You can't shoot me.
I'm the only one who knows who he is.

03:42.080 --> 03:44.879
No, no, no, no, no!

03:44.960 --> 03:46.639
Milner!

04:17.640 --> 04:19.719
- They've said he won't make it.
- What?

04:19.800 --> 04:21.279
Really?

04:21.840 --> 04:25.919
- Jessica? How's she?
- Not good. She hasn't said a word.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.039
She meets her dad for the first time,
and he tries to kill her brother.

04:30.120 --> 04:32.439
God. Families, eh?

04:32.520 --> 04:36.439
- What are we going to do about Grant?
- Oh, Dugdale said he'd have him.

04:36.520 --> 04:39.959
Give him a stable environment
or something.

04:42.520 --> 04:46.039
You know
this is all your fault?

04:46.120 --> 04:50.639
Well, you can get your mates
to start putting it right now, can't you?

04:50.720 --> 04:52.239
Yeah.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.119
We should talk about that.

04:57.240 --> 04:58.359
The mother of Ian Johnson...

04:58.440 --> 05:02.239
... is expected to make an appeal today
for her son to give himself up.

05:02.320 --> 05:05.159
Ian Johnson is wanted
for the murder of Joe Ducasor...

05:05.240 --> 05:07.799
... and for the murder of Roy Johnson,
his own brother.

05:07.880 --> 05:10.879
Theresa Johnson will be speaking later
at a press conference...

05:10.960 --> 05:14.519
... in an attempt to persuade her son
to hand himself in.

05:16.440 --> 05:19.799
Right, so,
I just spoke to Leah...

05:19.880 --> 05:22.399
... and it turns out
things are bad.

05:22.480 --> 05:25.679
The person Milner called
is trained to release Russian flu...

05:25.760 --> 05:28.799
... from five secret locations
all around the world.

05:28.880 --> 05:31.439
Now, we have no idea
who he is...

05:31.520 --> 05:34.639
... but the plan is that he does it
just before V Day...

05:34.720 --> 05:36.319
... which should give us
90 days to find him.

05:36.400 --> 05:40.839
But Leah says that if he feels
his mission is in any danger...

05:40.920 --> 05:43.239
... there's a secondary protocol.

05:44.280 --> 05:46.799
Tell him
the secondary protocol.

05:48.120 --> 05:50.559
The secondary protocol
is release immediately.

05:50.640 --> 05:53.199
He'll start to get the locations
of the flu canisters...

05:53.280 --> 05:55.439
... and when he has them all...

05:55.520 --> 05:58.799
Well, that's it.
Now, he'll be watching.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.439
The Network, media,
everything.

06:01.520 --> 06:04.759
If the slightest hint gets out
that we know, millions will die.

06:04.840 --> 06:07.279
Which means we can't use
The Network to find him.

06:07.360 --> 06:09.919
- Then how do we find him?
- Well...

06:11.160 --> 06:13.759
We have to do it. Us.

06:16.240 --> 06:18.719
Look, there's
three of these men.

06:18.800 --> 06:21.839
The one that gets chosen
goes straight into hiding.

06:21.920 --> 06:25.599
Now, I met one of the three: Paul.
He works in a shopping centre.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.279
We go there...

06:27.360 --> 06:32.439
... and if he's not around, well,
then we know he's the one we're looking for.

06:34.480 --> 06:36.039
Ian...

06:36.760 --> 06:40.839
We've had our differences,
and there's things that I am...

06:41.520 --> 06:43.199
... sorry for.

06:43.920 --> 06:46.119
But we're on
the same side now.

06:48.720 --> 06:50.759
Just to be clear, Wilson.

06:51.880 --> 06:54.959
We're not
on the same side, okay?

07:01.360 --> 07:04.799
Oh, and don't start
calling them "the three", okay?

07:04.880 --> 07:07.679
It's not Lord of the fucking Rings,
and you're not a hobbit or a...

07:07.760 --> 07:10.599
... fucking space goblin,
all right?

07:25.360 --> 07:27.559
Okay, I can see two ways.

07:27.640 --> 07:30.079
So you've got four people...

07:31.000 --> 07:32.479
... who need six eggs.

07:32.560 --> 07:35.959
You can work out how many eggs
for one person.

07:36.040 --> 07:39.959
- Yeah, that would be four into six...
- What are you doing that for?

07:40.480 --> 07:44.679
- I want to keep up my schoolwork.
- Why don't you join us, Grant?

07:48.040 --> 07:50.439
No, no, no.
You put that back.

07:51.200 --> 07:52.679
Put it back, Grant.

07:55.320 --> 07:57.959
- Grant! You put that back!
- Nah.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.639
I don't think I will.

08:14.280 --> 08:16.279
So was it fun
being with them?

08:16.360 --> 08:19.359
Did you get
a kick out of it, Wilson?

08:24.040 --> 08:25.999
Are you angry with me?

08:26.080 --> 08:30.479
Because you betrayed us and joined
the people that killed my brother?

08:32.800 --> 08:34.799
I lost my dad, Ian.

08:36.840 --> 08:38.959
You do remember that?

08:43.280 --> 08:44.359
Shit.

08:44.440 --> 08:47.239
- That's Paul. He's still here.
- Fuck.

08:47.320 --> 08:52.919
So... it's not him, then.
So we've got no idea who we're looking for.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.079
What are you doing with that?

08:55.160 --> 08:57.639
Is that a silencer?
Jesus, Wilson!

08:57.720 --> 08:59.839
- He's trained to release a virus.
- But we can't just kill him!

08:59.920 --> 09:02.199
It's okay.
Leah can cover this.

09:02.280 --> 09:05.279
That's not what he's talking about.
You wanna just execute him?

09:05.360 --> 09:07.999
You do understand what he's trained to do?
I mean, you do get that?

09:08.080 --> 09:10.679
- He's not the one!
- And what if there's another plan?

09:10.760 --> 09:14.639
How do we know that
he's not some kind of backup?

09:15.400 --> 09:17.519
And how long do we have
before somebody realises...

09:17.600 --> 09:21.919
- ... that Milner is dead?
- Wilson! Wilson, this isn't you.

09:23.080 --> 09:24.959
It just isn't.

09:26.280 --> 09:27.399
Look.

09:27.480 --> 09:31.159
We go to his house, right?
We... we break in.

09:31.840 --> 09:33.719
We find stuff out.

09:34.400 --> 09:36.519
But we're not killers.

09:47.760 --> 09:49.159
- Nothing.
- Piss on his bed.

09:49.240 --> 09:50.279
What?

09:50.360 --> 09:52.199
It needs to look like a burglary.
Piss on his bed.

09:52.280 --> 09:54.639
I'm not pissing on his bed.

09:57.320 --> 10:00.319
Oh, my God.
You have changed.

10:24.360 --> 10:26.479
- Here.
- Let me see.

10:30.520 --> 10:34.759
With the new OS, there are glitches,
so if he hasn't...

10:36.120 --> 10:38.319
Yes!
In through the camera roll.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.639
And that is why you should
always update immediately.

10:40.720 --> 10:42.559
I take it back.
You haven't changed.

10:42.640 --> 10:44.599
There's just one number.

10:44.680 --> 10:46.119
Dobri Gorski.

10:46.200 --> 10:49.039
Gorski?
That's Donaldson's professor.

10:49.120 --> 10:51.399
He's the bloke that told Donaldson
about Jimmy Deesh.

10:51.480 --> 10:53.559
Yeah, but he's dead.
He... he died last week.

10:53.640 --> 10:57.679
Well, that's odd,
because he called this phone yesterday.

11:16.720 --> 11:19.359
- It must be available somewhere.
- I've tried.

11:19.440 --> 11:22.639
No-one even knows about it.
It's top secret.

11:23.520 --> 11:25.719
I even thought
to reconstruct it myself...

11:25.800 --> 11:29.919
... but, er... molecular chemistry's
a tricky fucker.

11:30.520 --> 11:32.519
I've got about...

11:32.600 --> 11:34.959
... oh, four days' worth left.

11:38.720 --> 11:41.479
I've made a decision, Ian.

11:42.840 --> 11:44.959
I know I can't ask, but...

11:46.600 --> 11:49.159
- ... I'd like you to be there.
- No.

11:50.160 --> 11:54.319
- No, no. There must be another way.
- There isn't.

11:54.400 --> 11:56.519
There isn't, Ian.

11:57.720 --> 12:00.039
And it's my choice.

12:00.600 --> 12:02.359
Not yours.

12:05.440 --> 12:08.399
Oh, yeah.
I'd forgotten about all that.

12:08.480 --> 12:11.519
Turns out
Dobri Gorski isn't dead.

12:11.600 --> 12:15.759
- He's in custody for murder.
- What about the hit and run?

12:15.840 --> 12:17.759
That's who he murdered.

12:17.840 --> 12:20.159
The police station.
It has to be you and me, Becky.

12:20.240 --> 12:24.359
Ian can't be seen.
I'll call Leah. She'll get us access.

12:38.440 --> 12:40.599
Jesus Christ!
What the fuck...

12:40.680 --> 12:44.599
Terrence? I wasn't expecting you.
Er... not yet, I mean.

12:46.040 --> 12:47.159
Where is it?

12:47.240 --> 12:51.319
There's been a change of plan.
I need the locations now.

12:51.400 --> 12:52.719
It's...

12:53.680 --> 12:58.719
It's in here, actually, behind the fireplace,
top left-hand corner.

13:08.680 --> 13:11.079
Two? Just two locations?

13:11.160 --> 13:13.919
That's all I did.
Trager has the others.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.279
There's no need for a gun.

13:21.480 --> 13:23.519
No. No, Terrence.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.319
Please don't. No!

13:26.720 --> 13:28.839
Sit back now.

13:28.920 --> 13:30.639
What are you doing?

13:30.720 --> 13:32.599
What I'm trained to do.

13:32.680 --> 13:35.759
I won't talk, Terrence.
I won't tell anyone.

14:11.920 --> 14:14.639
You've still got
her blood on you.

14:16.920 --> 14:22.079
Exista trei proteine diferite...

14:24.800 --> 14:26.799
Stop that.

14:27.320 --> 14:29.159
Stop that now.

14:30.680 --> 14:34.639
We need to get to know each other.
Do you understand that?

14:35.760 --> 14:37.959
We need to communicate.

14:38.680 --> 14:41.319
She's dead, Jessica.

14:41.400 --> 14:43.839
I saw her go.

15:50.880 --> 15:53.319
Don't move a fucking muscle.

15:54.840 --> 15:56.399
Jessica?

15:57.120 --> 15:58.759
Jessica Hyde?

15:59.520 --> 16:01.039
That you?

16:04.160 --> 16:07.159
I've got a good grip
on these tubes, Jess.

16:07.240 --> 16:10.119
Think if I yank them out,
them doctors will get in quick enough?

16:10.200 --> 16:14.079
If you hurt him, one second later,
you stop breathing. Understand?

16:14.160 --> 16:15.919
Oh, I understand.

16:16.760 --> 16:21.479
So why don't you come round where I can
see you, see if we can't resolve this?

16:24.960 --> 16:27.199
You're prettier
than your photo.

16:27.280 --> 16:30.559
Take your hand off those tubes
and I'll let you walk out.

16:30.640 --> 16:32.799
Nothing scares me.

16:32.880 --> 16:35.079
Nothing in the world.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.959
Except him.

16:38.160 --> 16:40.679
He wants me dead, Jess.

16:41.560 --> 16:44.719
I'll count to three.
You let go.

16:44.800 --> 16:47.039
I'll put this down.

16:47.120 --> 16:49.999
- He's not gonna make it, Jess.
- One.

16:50.720 --> 16:53.959
- We'd be doing him a favour.
- Two.

16:55.400 --> 16:56.599
Three.

17:41.080 --> 17:42.359
Becky.

17:42.440 --> 17:45.679
Ah, man,
I have such a headache.

17:51.160 --> 17:52.799
You got a boyfriend?

17:52.880 --> 17:54.879
Cos I think you freaky...

17:54.960 --> 17:57.039
... and I like you a lot.

18:01.880 --> 18:03.959
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

18:05.560 --> 18:09.399
So, they, er...
they picked Dobri up drunk.

18:09.480 --> 18:12.399
Said that he found someone,
same age, build...

18:12.480 --> 18:16.999
... drove a HGV truck on his skull,
and then he...

18:18.400 --> 18:19.239
Oh, fuck.

18:19.320 --> 18:22.919
He took a hammer and a nail and
individually cracked out his own teeth...

18:23.000 --> 18:25.879
... and put them inside
the man's head.

18:25.960 --> 18:28.239
What was he scared of?

18:29.240 --> 18:32.479
Sort of takes me back, this, you and me.
We made a good team, Becky.

18:32.560 --> 18:35.919
- So if you did want to talk about...
- Let's just do this, Wilson.

18:39.120 --> 18:40.919
Please.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.279
You get me out of here.

18:44.160 --> 18:45.359
Please.

18:45.440 --> 18:48.799
- You're safe. It's a police station.
- Safe? I'm not fucking safe!

18:48.880 --> 18:51.479
I'm not safe here.
I'm not safe anywhere!

18:51.560 --> 18:54.239
- Why? Who are you scared of?
- Fuck.

18:54.320 --> 18:56.039
We're going to help, okay?
We're going to find this guy.

18:56.120 --> 18:59.039
You think I'm fucking stupid?

18:59.120 --> 19:01.359
You'll not find him!
You'll never find him!

19:01.440 --> 19:03.479
I knew this was coming.

19:03.560 --> 19:05.919
I gave my life to Janus.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.279
But now it's here...

19:10.240 --> 19:12.039
... and I...

19:13.200 --> 19:15.559
... I want to keep my shitty life.

19:15.640 --> 19:18.399
Why?
You think he's going to kill you?

19:19.400 --> 19:21.399
Why?

19:21.480 --> 19:25.559
- Why... Why would he do that?
- I trained them.

19:26.160 --> 19:28.879
I know who they are.

19:32.320 --> 19:34.079
Dobri.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.399
We saw Paul Simpson.

19:39.560 --> 19:41.399
It's not him.

19:42.560 --> 19:45.279
Tell us the names
of the other two, please.

19:45.360 --> 19:47.319
We'll find him.

19:50.040 --> 19:52.239
I tell you...

19:52.320 --> 19:54.719
... you protect me, eh?

19:59.720 --> 20:02.119
You can't protect me.

20:02.200 --> 20:04.559
No-one can protect me.

20:13.080 --> 20:15.039
Paul Simpson.

20:18.160 --> 20:20.119
Terrence Truman.

20:21.520 --> 20:22.959
Michael Johns.

20:23.040 --> 20:25.039
They are the three.

20:25.120 --> 20:27.399
- Now you hide me?
- Look, you're safe here.

20:27.480 --> 20:29.679
There's a whole police station above you.
12 SCO19 officers...

20:29.760 --> 20:33.519
Oh, that will not stop him!
Do you not listen?

21:18.440 --> 21:20.599
How could you do that?

21:22.120 --> 21:25.239
How could you shoot
at people you love?

21:27.240 --> 21:29.639
The world's full of love.

21:30.240 --> 21:33.999
Billions of people
loving billions of others.

21:34.600 --> 21:38.919
All that love will turn to dust
when our resources die.

21:39.760 --> 21:45.279
I've seen what people are capable of
when they feel they're losing everything.

21:45.920 --> 21:47.719
Look around.

21:51.560 --> 21:54.839
Do you really think
we're so far from that?

21:59.880 --> 22:03.959
Michael Johns is still at his job
in an estate agent in Penge.

22:04.040 --> 22:06.439
We've sent someone to him.

22:08.120 --> 22:11.639
And I've also taken care of Paul Simpson
at the shopping centre.

22:11.720 --> 22:13.719
Where did you say?
The back?

22:13.800 --> 22:15.959
Er... no, I... I can't see anything.

22:18.240 --> 22:22.119
It's Terrence.
That's who we're looking for.

22:39.960 --> 22:41.639
Two more.

22:42.760 --> 22:45.639
Great. Just one more to go.

22:47.520 --> 22:49.719
It's a nice cover, this.

22:49.800 --> 22:52.199
- The fish stall.
- Yeah, nice.

22:52.280 --> 22:55.519
I've got a fucking Fields Medal,
you know.

22:57.040 --> 22:59.279
I'll be glad when all this is over.
My wife...

23:11.360 --> 23:14.559
Bad news.
He's killing people.

23:14.640 --> 23:20.039
Last night this man, Danny Silbert,
died in the bath.

23:20.120 --> 23:24.119
An unfortunate lesson in why water
and electricity do not mix.

23:24.200 --> 23:28.399
He was posing as a lecturer,
but he was actually a Network virologist.

23:28.480 --> 23:30.279
Terrence's DNA
was found at the scene...

23:30.360 --> 23:33.119
... and then this man
was shot dead this morning.

23:33.200 --> 23:34.959
Again, he was with us.

23:35.040 --> 23:38.799
John Trager. He was quite an
accomplished mathematician, actually.

23:38.880 --> 23:44.839
We know these men visited Roseira,
Ratanda, Laishui, and Hartwell, Georgia.

23:44.920 --> 23:47.919
Terrence is gathering
the locations.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.119
He's enacting
the secondary protocol.

23:50.200 --> 23:54.399
- He's going to release the virus now?
- It would appear so, dear.

23:54.480 --> 23:56.839
Call me "dear" again,
and I'll cut your face off.

23:56.920 --> 23:58.879
So who's got
the last location?

23:58.960 --> 24:01.679
That's exactly
what we have to find out, d...

24:01.760 --> 24:03.759
Are they linked in any way?
The dead men?

24:03.840 --> 24:06.879
They were
at the same university.

24:08.880 --> 24:13.359
- What, we have to go through all this?
- I thought it was best to be thorough.

24:27.240 --> 24:29.239
What would you have done...

24:30.560 --> 24:33.639
... in the van,
if I did try and shoot Paul?

24:36.680 --> 24:40.439
- You don't think it's ever justified?
- Where can it lead?

24:41.160 --> 24:42.999
Look at Milner.

24:43.600 --> 24:45.439
Look at Grant.

24:46.720 --> 24:48.639
Once you kill, I...

24:49.640 --> 24:52.799
- I don't think you come back.
- Milner said...

24:52.880 --> 24:55.919
... when she took life,
it felt like she was...

24:56.680 --> 24:59.439
... bleeding inside.

25:02.320 --> 25:05.359
I don't know. Maybe you can come back.
I mean...

25:05.960 --> 25:07.759
... things change.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.599
Look at us.

25:13.040 --> 25:15.719
Well, we're talking, Ian.

25:19.120 --> 25:20.959
Where's Becky?

25:46.840 --> 25:49.639
What the fuck
are we doing here?

25:51.480 --> 25:53.039
Are you all right, Geoff?

25:58.840 --> 26:00.359
This...

26:01.120 --> 26:05.159
... is a detailed confession
of everything I've been involved in.

26:05.240 --> 26:09.359
I'm getting out. Brazil.
I've got friends there.

26:10.400 --> 26:12.639
But we'll never be safe
unless we bring them down.

26:12.720 --> 26:17.039
This is explosive,
but it needs to be corroborated by you.

26:18.640 --> 26:23.359
I'm gonna give you this and an address,
and when I'm gone, you send it there.

26:25.080 --> 26:27.839
And you get five million.

26:36.560 --> 26:38.999
What about
your wife and kids?

26:40.240 --> 26:44.119
I've thought about that, and I...
I think they'll be fine, I really do.

26:44.800 --> 26:48.719
- And I'll send for them later.
- And, er... my family?

26:50.000 --> 26:51.999
Did you forget about them?

26:53.000 --> 26:57.279
Michael! What the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing? Jesus Christ!

27:00.040 --> 27:01.919
Stop it!

27:05.840 --> 27:09.639
You! You listen to me,
you weaselly gobshite!

27:09.720 --> 27:14.039
You dragged me screaming
into this filth...

27:14.120 --> 27:16.519
... and now you want me
to get you out?

27:16.600 --> 27:18.319
Well, you're gonna stay where you are.
You get it?

27:18.400 --> 27:20.799
You're gonna stay smiling,
grinning...

27:20.880 --> 27:24.759
... do what you're told,
or I'll fucking kill you myself!

27:45.720 --> 27:48.079
- What are you doing?
- French.

27:48.160 --> 27:49.799
French?

27:50.640 --> 27:52.159
French don't stop bullets.

27:52.240 --> 27:54.839
- French won't fucking help you when...
- Grant.

27:54.920 --> 27:56.999
Stand up and come here.

27:58.760 --> 28:00.679
I asked you to come here.

28:14.080 --> 28:15.559
Now, you're a young man.

28:15.640 --> 28:17.759
I can't tell you what to do
or what to say...

28:17.840 --> 28:21.999
... but I do not want you scaring Alice.
Do you understand?

28:26.440 --> 28:30.199
- I asked if you understood.
- Yeah. Sorry.

28:30.280 --> 28:33.399
And while you're in this house,
you will not turn the air blue. You got it?

28:33.480 --> 28:35.839
- Sorry, Mrs. Dugdale.
- Now I want you to go upstairs...

28:35.920 --> 28:38.879
... get the knife, and bring it back down
to the kitchen where it belongs.

28:38.960 --> 28:41.079
And behave!

28:41.720 --> 28:43.919
Yes, Mrs. Dugdale.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.039
And Grant?

28:46.120 --> 28:48.159
You can call me Jen.

29:12.040 --> 29:14.319
You didn't tell her about us.

29:17.960 --> 29:20.479
I'm sorry
about your brother, Ian.

29:21.920 --> 29:23.599
Thank you.

29:24.920 --> 29:28.799
- I'm sorry about yours.
- He's fighting like a bastard.

29:28.880 --> 29:31.799
Is it weird to say
I'm proud of him?

29:34.160 --> 29:36.159
Why didn't you tell her?

29:38.160 --> 29:40.159
It didn't seem right.

29:41.360 --> 29:43.199
That's fair.

29:44.120 --> 29:46.039
I understand.

29:50.360 --> 29:52.879
There's a cupboard over there.

29:54.040 --> 29:56.599
- What?
- We could go inside.

29:57.520 --> 29:59.919
- You and me.
- Are you serious?

30:00.000 --> 30:02.839
There's nothing wrong with two people
in pain holding onto each other.

30:02.920 --> 30:06.479
Jesus fucking Christ, Jessica.
I'm with Becky.

30:06.560 --> 30:08.999
Okay? I'm with Becky.

30:09.080 --> 30:12.119
But not for long.
We both know that.

30:12.920 --> 30:16.359
I found it.
I... I fucking found it!

30:20.920 --> 30:24.359
Okay, we've been looking for
connections with other students:

30:24.440 --> 30:27.719
Mathematicians, virologists
and whatnot, right?

30:27.800 --> 30:30.399
Well, it turns out Donaldson
studied there too...

30:30.480 --> 30:33.119
... and guess who was a professor
to all three of them?

30:33.200 --> 30:35.319
Oh, Christ.

30:35.400 --> 30:38.519
Dobri. Dobri Gorski.

31:33.200 --> 31:35.159
Help me! Help me!

31:37.120 --> 31:39.919
Get me out of here!
Get me...!

32:00.080 --> 32:02.919
There was a break-in
at Dobri's house last night.

32:03.000 --> 32:06.919
It's safe to assume
Terrence now has the last location.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.159
Oh, my God. So, he...
he's gonna go Fat Man on him?

32:10.240 --> 32:12.279
- Now? It's actually happening?
- No, no. No, no.

32:12.360 --> 32:16.919
- This is good news.
- How the fuck is this good news?

32:17.000 --> 32:18.959
Don't you understand?
This is an opportunity.

32:19.040 --> 32:22.039
He will release the virus
here first.

32:22.120 --> 32:24.239
So he's on his way
to Denham right now.

32:24.320 --> 32:27.639
How does that help?
We know it's a car park. But which one?

32:27.720 --> 32:31.639
Dobri was there. He will have parked.
We check his credit card.

32:31.720 --> 32:33.879
But what if he paid cash?

32:35.160 --> 32:38.239
Then we are all
very fucked, dear.

32:45.200 --> 32:48.719
They know where Terrence is going.
We're closest, Jessica.

32:48.800 --> 32:52.319
It's a car park in Denham.
They think he's going there right now.

32:52.400 --> 32:53.759
I can't leave him alone.

32:54.960 --> 32:57.479
- I can't leave him.
- Look, the others are coming back.

32:57.560 --> 33:01.159
They'll be 40 minutes.
I can't do this on my own.

33:01.240 --> 33:02.639
Jessica, please.

35:41.280 --> 35:42.919
Release... Release...

35:44.040 --> 35:45.559
Release...

36:26.760 --> 36:28.679
I'm sorry.

36:28.760 --> 36:30.559
I'm so sorry.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.519
Terrence?

36:46.600 --> 36:48.319
What are you doing?

36:48.880 --> 36:50.239
Terrence, please.

36:51.720 --> 36:53.759
Terrence, don't release it!

36:54.240 --> 36:56.719
The vaccine doesn't work.

36:56.800 --> 36:58.599
It's gonna kill millions.

37:00.680 --> 37:02.999
Don't. Don't!

37:03.080 --> 37:04.559
Please.

37:07.400 --> 37:08.439
Terrence!

37:08.520 --> 37:10.079
Terrence!

37:10.880 --> 37:12.679
Please.

38:53.640 --> 38:55.479
What can you see?

38:57.520 --> 38:59.159
Marius.

39:00.080 --> 39:03.759
He's... he's just grinning
at me, Ian.

39:10.400 --> 39:12.759
Hey. Hey, look at me.

39:12.840 --> 39:14.639
Just look at me.

39:15.640 --> 39:17.359
Has he gone?

39:23.360 --> 39:25.119
Come here.

39:34.840 --> 39:36.519
This...

39:37.920 --> 39:39.319
... is Nembutal.

39:39.400 --> 39:41.959
Strictly speaking,
I should take it with an anti-emetic...

39:42.040 --> 39:44.199
- ... but I think it should be okay.
- Jesus Christ, Becky. Please stop.

39:44.280 --> 39:46.079
No. It's today.

39:46.760 --> 39:48.559
I'm doing it today.

39:48.640 --> 39:51.359
I've only got two days
of Thoraxin left.

39:51.440 --> 39:55.279
I just want to spend my last hours
with someone I love.

39:55.360 --> 39:59.439
Now, I know
it's too much to ask of you.

40:01.520 --> 40:03.759
But I am asking.

40:08.920 --> 40:12.239
- Okay.
- Thank you.

40:19.400 --> 40:21.719
Okay, everything's arranged.

40:21.800 --> 40:24.519
Er... Jen,
I've done the dishes.

40:24.600 --> 40:26.759
Er... do you want
anything else doing?

40:26.840 --> 40:30.239
Er... no. Why don't you go in with Alice
and do some schoolwork?

40:30.320 --> 40:33.239
It's... it's okay, Grant.
She'll help you.

40:33.320 --> 40:34.999
- Yeah, okay, okay.
- Okay.

40:35.080 --> 40:39.879
- Hello, Mr. Dugdale.
- Er... yeah, hello. Hello, hello, Grant.

40:39.960 --> 40:42.759
Yeah, I don't understand it either.
Let's not question it.

40:42.840 --> 40:46.559
- So... we're all go, then?
- We leave today.

40:46.640 --> 40:48.159
We're meeting Wilson later.

40:48.240 --> 40:52.359
He's got them to get us new passports,
IDs, everything.

40:53.320 --> 40:58.479
It'll be another country tomorrow.
It's a whole new life for all of us.

41:00.600 --> 41:02.839
This is the right thing.

41:02.920 --> 41:03.879
Okay.

41:28.240 --> 41:30.759
That's it. All ready to go.

41:30.840 --> 41:33.479
Did they manage to pick up
the other canisters?

41:33.560 --> 41:34.839
- The virus?
- They did.

41:34.920 --> 41:38.679
The locations Terrence had were right.
So that's all...

41:40.120 --> 41:44.159
I can't believe Milner,
thinking it's okay to lose so many lives.

41:44.240 --> 41:48.319
Well, don't try and figure her out, Wilson.
You'll go fucking nuts.

41:48.400 --> 41:52.599
That thinking, though. I mean,
losing that much life is never acceptable.

41:55.960 --> 41:58.159
But losing some is.

41:58.680 --> 42:00.919
There are villages and towns
in remote places -

42:01.000 --> 42:03.679
... islands, deserts
accessed by one road -

42:03.760 --> 42:07.559
... places where a virus
could be released...

42:07.640 --> 42:11.839
... and controlled, without risk
of spread to the wider population.

42:11.920 --> 42:14.639
See, she was wrong,
Michael.

42:15.120 --> 42:19.319
You don't need a pandemic
for people to take the vaccine.

42:21.080 --> 42:23.839
You just need
the fear of a pandemic.

42:26.920 --> 42:28.479
Have you got our IDs?

42:28.560 --> 42:30.799
We... we just want to go now.
We have a flight to...

42:30.880 --> 42:32.679
I'm afraid that's not on
any more.

42:33.960 --> 42:36.759
We're gonna need you
to go home.

42:37.840 --> 42:38.879
"We"?

42:44.800 --> 42:49.559
On my command, that man
will start to execute your family.

42:49.640 --> 42:53.079
Grant first, then Alice.
Finally Jen.

42:53.160 --> 42:58.039
There are people putting cameras up
in your house, your work...

42:58.120 --> 43:00.999
... where you get your coffee,
right now.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.279
We're going to tag you
this time.

43:03.360 --> 43:06.719
We're going to make sure
you're watched 100%.

43:08.280 --> 43:10.799
You'll be watched
in your sleep.

43:12.640 --> 43:14.879
We have to do this, Michael.
Look at Alice and Grant.

43:14.960 --> 43:17.119
What kind of future do you want
for people like them?

43:17.200 --> 43:18.599
Wilson.

43:19.280 --> 43:21.119
Jesus Christ.

43:22.160 --> 43:25.799
- Don't...
- I promise you, I'll be better than her.

43:25.880 --> 43:30.399
When all this is done, I'll let you go.
All of you.

43:31.160 --> 43:32.959
Count on that.

43:36.240 --> 43:38.359
Wilson, Wilson. Wilson.

43:38.440 --> 43:40.639
Don't... don't do this.

43:40.720 --> 43:44.399
- Please. This is not you.
- No.

43:46.800 --> 43:49.359
I don't think I am me.

43:52.320 --> 43:53.959
Not any more.

43:57.560 --> 43:59.839
Take your family home.

44:05.120 --> 44:06.079
Now.

45:28.960 --> 45:30.919
- You are filthy.
- I'm getting up.

45:31.000 --> 45:32.839
Go and get me a drink.

45:44.640 --> 45:49.039
- I'm just getting some champagne.
- You... you're doing amazing.

45:49.120 --> 45:52.199
I saw you laughing.
It's great.

46:01.640 --> 46:04.479
- Well, I didn't expect you here.
- I...

46:05.760 --> 46:07.519
I just wanted to say bye.

46:07.600 --> 46:10.199
- Are you scared, Becky?
- Yeah.

46:10.800 --> 46:14.039
Sort of... terrified.

46:16.040 --> 46:18.319
But I know it's what I want.

46:34.240 --> 46:36.559
And you think this is right?

46:37.120 --> 46:38.919
For him, I mean?

46:39.680 --> 46:44.279
Have you ever looked into the eyes
of someone you love who's dying?

46:45.040 --> 46:48.319
It's not something
that leaves you.

47:10.120 --> 47:12.359
You wanted to see me?

47:26.280 --> 47:28.879
Am I supposed to be scared?

47:32.520 --> 47:34.719
So, revenge, is it?

47:34.800 --> 47:37.319
This isn't you, Wilson.

47:37.400 --> 47:39.319
You're not this.

47:41.440 --> 47:44.639
There's no reason to kill me,
and we both know you need a...

47:59.520 --> 48:01.199
Ah... she must stop.

48:01.280 --> 48:03.359
What?
Anton, are you... Are you all right?

48:03.440 --> 48:06.359
You asked me to reconstruct this...
what, Thoraxin?

48:06.440 --> 48:08.999
- Yeah, yes.
- It doesn't exist. There is no Thoraxin.

48:09.080 --> 48:10.759
- She must stop taking it.
- But then what is it?

48:10.840 --> 48:14.399
Well...
It... it's a rather complex opiate.

48:14.480 --> 48:18.559
It's mildly addictive.
Somewhere between heroin and caffeine.

48:18.640 --> 48:22.639
- Hallucinatory as she took more.
- It's... No, no, hang on. She had...

48:22.720 --> 48:24.599
- What?
- She had shakes, tremors. She had fits.

48:24.680 --> 48:26.759
Yes, yes. Withdrawal.
It was withdrawal.

48:26.840 --> 48:28.599
So is she ill?

48:28.680 --> 48:31.359
Well, she has
the genetic mutation.

48:31.440 --> 48:35.079
But I have no reason
to believe it has triggered.

48:35.160 --> 48:36.999
I think she's well.

48:37.800 --> 48:39.679
- An opiate?
- Yes.

48:39.760 --> 48:44.319
- Why would Donaldson do that?
- Well, there are bad people in this world.

48:44.400 --> 48:47.479
People who need
to control others.

48:53.040 --> 48:55.239
Becky! Becky, I just...

48:57.400 --> 48:59.999
No, no, no. Becky? Becky!

49:00.720 --> 49:03.039
Becky! Becky!

49:21.120 --> 49:22.799
Becky?

49:22.880 --> 49:24.359
Becky...

49:24.880 --> 49:27.479
No. No, no, no.
Come on. Becky.

50:15.280 --> 50:17.159
- Come with us now.
- What?

50:25.440 --> 50:26.479
Please.

50:32.040 --> 50:34.239
That's it, that's it.
It's okay.

50:34.320 --> 50:35.719
It's okay.

50:35.800 --> 50:38.439
That's it. That's it.

50:42.680 --> 50:44.799
That's it, you're okay.
You're okay.

50:44.880 --> 50:47.799
You're not ill.
You're not sick. It's okay.

50:49.520 --> 50:50.439
What the fuck?

50:50.520 --> 50:54.359
Becky! Becky!
Get the fuck off me! Becky!

50:56.040 --> 50:58.559
Becky! Becky!
