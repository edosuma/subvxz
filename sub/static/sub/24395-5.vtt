proved his worth. What else?

22:48.325 --> 22:50.926
Misha Halenko is a nationalist
and an extremist.

22:50.928 --> 22:53.862
He'll be determined to get
what he wants at all costs.

22:53.864 --> 22:55.430
Well, that could work in our favor.

22:55.432 --> 22:56.765
Eric.

22:56.767 --> 22:58.100
Be careful.

22:58.444 --> 23:00.135
Yeah.

23:08.045 --> 23:09.611
Any luck?

23:09.613 --> 23:11.780
I located a launcher
from a supplier in Munich.

23:11.782 --> 23:12.881
It's on its way.

23:12.883 --> 23:14.716
Okay. That's great.

23:14.718 --> 23:16.418
Uh, where's your wife, Mr. Cummings?

23:16.420 --> 23:18.453
In the kitchen. She's not speaking to me.

23:18.455 --> 23:20.925
We'll speak to her together.

23:21.892 --> 23:23.058
There's been a development.

23:23.060 --> 23:24.392
My colleague, Zara Hallam,

23:24.394 --> 23:26.495
recognized one of the kidnappers.

23:27.223 --> 23:29.197
He's an NYPD detective.

23:29.199 --> 23:30.832
I don't understand.

23:30.834 --> 23:31.967
ERIC: He's working undercover.

23:31.969 --> 23:33.168
Counterterrorism.

23:33.170 --> 23:34.769
So these <i> are</i> terrorists?

23:34.771 --> 23:37.572
The detective believes
that if you deliver the weapon,

23:38.150 --> 23:41.243
he'll be able to arrest
their leader and free your son.

23:41.779 --> 23:43.478
And do you believe that?

23:44.865 --> 23:46.951
That's the strategy we're pursuing.

23:46.976 --> 23:48.309
Now, it's your decision,

23:48.334 --> 23:50.601
but I have to advise you
to seek legal counsel.

23:50.603 --> 23:52.289
What for?

23:54.039 --> 23:55.668
To protect me.

23:56.218 --> 23:58.452
A judge may very well consider
mitigating factors,

23:58.454 --> 24:00.554
but if your husband
does what the kidnappers ask,

24:00.556 --> 24:03.256
he could be charged with
supplying weapons to terrorists.

24:04.051 --> 24:05.725
No matter how you set it up in the past,

24:05.727 --> 24:08.595
this deal is illegal
and could mean prison.

24:08.597 --> 24:11.264
Our only priority is Henry.

24:12.126 --> 24:14.627
And you could say I deserve what I get.

24:15.037 --> 24:16.403
(SIGHS)

24:16.405 --> 24:18.505
I'm so sorry.

24:19.108 --> 24:21.274
I only wanted good things

24:21.276 --> 24:24.211
for you, for us

24:24.213 --> 24:26.079
and for Henry.

24:44.329 --> 24:47.167
ZARA: All right, let me
take a look at this.

24:47.169 --> 24:49.469
Okay. Look at me.

24:49.471 --> 24:51.771
Take a deep breath.

24:51.773 --> 24:54.341
(INHALES) This is gonna hurt
like hell, but I'll be quick.

24:54.343 --> 24:55.442
Aah!

24:55.444 --> 24:57.611
(PANTING)

24:57.613 --> 24:58.981
There.

24:59.481 --> 25:01.815
Your arm is reset.

25:02.851 --> 25:05.863
It will only get better from here.

25:06.755 --> 25:08.688
Here we go.

25:08.690 --> 25:11.191
Can you get me out of here?

25:11.702 --> 25:13.460
Not yet.

25:13.462 --> 25:15.028
But soon.

25:16.865 --> 25:19.032
Why did they take me, anyway?

25:23.138 --> 25:24.692
Did you do this to him?

25:24.694 --> 25:26.445
No, Val did.

25:26.447 --> 25:28.174
Misha's asking what's taking so long.

25:28.176 --> 25:29.543
You better get back.

25:30.220 --> 25:32.078
- Now.
- It's okay.

25:32.080 --> 25:34.548
Let's go. Move.

25:39.655 --> 25:41.421
Okay.

25:41.423 --> 25:42.822
This will have to do for now.

25:42.824 --> 25:44.190
Sorry.

25:46.570 --> 25:49.362
Stay strong, Henry Cummings.

25:49.364 --> 25:51.197
I'll be back.

25:58.457 --> 25:59.906
We need to be civil if we're gonna

25:59.908 --> 26:01.841
- pretend to be a couple, yeah?
- Just give me the kid

26:01.843 --> 26:03.310
and I'm out of your hair.

26:04.612 --> 26:06.012
Kid'll be free soon enough.

26:07.091 --> 26:09.015
Misha said something about a party.

26:09.017 --> 26:10.784
- What was he talking about?
- Don't know.

26:11.548 --> 26:12.919
Don't know.

26:12.921 --> 26:15.422
But I did find an address
in Misha's search history.

26:15.958 --> 26:18.058
1045 Storkower.

26:18.060 --> 26:20.460
Pretty sure that's where he's
picking up the missile launcher.

26:20.462 --> 26:23.331
But that's central Berlin.
That's not very discreet

26:23.333 --> 26:24.464
for an arms deal.

26:27.102 --> 26:29.405
Why do you think he's doing this?

26:30.105 --> 26:31.538
Misha's family was killed

26:31.540 --> 26:33.039
in a passenger plane that was shot down

26:33.041 --> 26:34.240
by the Russians.

26:34.242 --> 26:37.010
Three kids and his wife, gone...

26:37.012 --> 26:38.086
just like that.

26:38.088 --> 26:39.879
(PHONE RINGING)

26:46.555 --> 26:49.356
Hello, Mr. Beaumont.

26:49.358 --> 26:51.057
I hope you're calling with good news.

26:51.059 --> 26:52.826
Ken Cummings can get you
the missile launcher

26:52.828 --> 26:53.927
in just a few hours.

26:53.929 --> 26:56.429
That is very good news.

26:56.431 --> 26:59.065
Listen, there's an alley
behind grocery store

26:59.067 --> 27:01.034
on Heckerdamm Street.

27:01.603 --> 27:04.371
Leave it at the bottom
of the stairway at noon.

27:04.373 --> 27:05.672
What about Henry?

27:05.674 --> 27:06.840
How's his arm?

27:06.842 --> 27:07.928
Better.

27:07.930 --> 27:10.410
You will get a call
with his exact location.

27:10.412 --> 27:12.781
Of course, after I get my product.

27:14.449 --> 27:16.349
How do we know he'll keep his word?

27:16.351 --> 27:17.917
We don't.

27:17.919 --> 27:19.552
But at least we have someone
on the inside

27:19.554 --> 27:21.421
who can make sure your son is safe.

27:21.957 --> 27:23.490
Let's get a drink.

27:24.209 --> 27:25.625
Coming?

27:26.420 --> 27:28.338
I'm good, Steve.

27:30.766 --> 27:32.799
May I?

27:38.006 --> 27:40.507
No drink for you?

27:40.509 --> 27:42.909
Pregnant, remember?

27:42.911 --> 27:46.346
(LAUGHS) I do, but I guess he doesn't.

27:48.650 --> 27:50.417
So you must have kids, then.

27:51.320 --> 27:52.919
I...

27:52.921 --> 27:55.121
I had kids.

27:58.226 --> 27:59.870
It's...

28:20.795 --> 28:22.328
(WHISPERING): Relax.

28:22.584 --> 28:23.850
We got to go. Get up.

28:27.456 --> 28:30.108
Come on. Let's go.

28:30.685 --> 28:32.892
Wait. Misha is getting the weapon today.

28:33.779 --> 28:35.929
But if the pickup address
is on Heckerdamm,

28:35.931 --> 28:37.864
what's on Storkower?

28:37.866 --> 28:39.232
Don't know. Come on.

28:39.234 --> 28:40.834
- The target?
- No, the target's

28:40.836 --> 28:43.136
in New York City. Let's go.

28:43.138 --> 28:44.706
This doesn't make any sense.

28:49.144 --> 28:50.810
Call the German police.

28:50.812 --> 28:52.330
Tell them something's about to go down.

28:52.332 --> 28:54.080
No. No, this is my bust.

28:54.082 --> 28:55.081
When we land at JFK...

28:55.083 --> 28:56.883
- Steve, do it now.
- No.

28:56.885 --> 29:00.013
(WHISPERING): Let's go. Now.

29:06.695 --> 29:09.028
VAL: Misha, come.

29:09.030 --> 29:11.531
You need to see this.

29:18.774 --> 29:20.006
What?

29:20.008 --> 29:21.410
See this.

29:25.414 --> 29:27.347
From the laptop security camera.

29:27.349 --> 29:28.782
I told you.

29:28.784 --> 29:30.884
He must be a cop.

29:33.155 --> 29:34.788
You really ought to lay off the booze.

29:34.790 --> 29:36.389
You are not seeing this straight.

29:36.391 --> 29:38.378
Man, you are still one
bossy bitch, you know that?

29:38.380 --> 29:39.945
- Bossy bitch?
- Yeah.

29:39.947 --> 29:41.628
Is that what you call the ones
who stand up to you?

29:41.630 --> 29:43.963
Come on.

29:43.965 --> 29:45.965
(SCOFFS, CHUCKLES)

29:46.643 --> 29:48.943
Zara, you loved the attention.

29:48.945 --> 29:51.437
- It's called assault, you idiot.
- Oh, yeah,

29:51.439 --> 29:53.439
you were so helpless you broke my nose.

29:53.441 --> 29:54.607
And I will do it again.

29:54.609 --> 29:56.009
Problem with you, Zar,

29:56.011 --> 29:57.744
is you couldn't hack it.

29:57.746 --> 29:59.712
I was a perfect excuse for you to quit.

29:59.714 --> 30:01.581
I loved that job and you stole it.

30:01.583 --> 30:02.982
I dropped the charges.

30:02.984 --> 30:04.551
Besides, look at you now.

30:04.553 --> 30:05.985
You're not doing so bad.

30:05.987 --> 30:07.754
They all looked at me like I was crazy

30:07.756 --> 30:09.422
and you got first-class detective.

30:09.424 --> 30:11.291
No, no, no, no, I got what I deserved.

30:11.293 --> 30:13.026
Yeah, what's that? A promotion, but...

30:13.028 --> 30:15.762
no wife, no family, a drinking problem.

30:16.298 --> 30:18.331
What do you have, Steve?

30:18.333 --> 30:19.635
Tell me.

30:20.468 --> 30:22.836
Do the right thing just this once.

30:28.443 --> 30:30.076
Time to go.

30:30.078 --> 30:32.145
- Well, what about the kid?
- The kid is staying.

30:32.147 --> 30:33.479
So does she.

30:33.481 --> 30:34.514
She's coming with us.

30:34.516 --> 30:36.716
But just one more thing.

30:36.718 --> 30:38.751
It seems that nobody's
who they say they are.

30:38.753 --> 30:40.286
Did you know your, uh,

30:40.288 --> 30:43.289
so-called boyfriend, Steve,
is some kind of cop?

30:44.326 --> 30:45.992
Excuse me, him?

30:45.994 --> 30:47.303
- (CHUCKLES)
- No.

30:47.305 --> 30:49.295
He's too crooked even for the cops.

30:49.297 --> 30:50.897
Misha, come on.
What are you talking about?

30:50.899 --> 30:52.832
You were looking at my computer.

30:52.834 --> 30:54.400
Yeah, I was.

30:54.402 --> 30:56.002
I was looking for
a medical clinic for that kid.

30:56.004 --> 30:58.771
(CHUCKLES) And then you were
talking on your phone.

30:58.773 --> 31:00.640
Then you went up for a drink,

31:00.642 --> 31:03.142
and that drink turns up
to be American girlfriend,

31:03.144 --> 31:04.944

does that make you?

31:54.688 --> 31:56.087
was undercover cop?

31:57.065 --> 31:59.657
That was our working theory.

Henry.

Whatever that cop is up to
is of no interest to me.

- I'll follow them.
- They're getting the launcher.

it into the States?

32:28.204 --> 32:29.721
- Well, that's NYPD's concern.
- That's right,

32:29.723 --> 32:31.589
but their guy is otherwise occupied.

32:31.591 --> 32:33.282
All right, as soon as you get Henry,

32:33.284 --> 32:35.794
you have Max call New York.

- What?

after they invaded Crimea.

to Berlin to buy weapons

for an attack in New York,
he came here for the attack.

34:30.010 --> 34:32.463
All right, I'm hanging up. 1-1-0.

34:32.465 --> 34:34.078
WOMAN: Hello?

34:34.094 --> 34:36.701

34:36.750 --> 34:37.801
(WOMAN SPEAKING GERMAN)

34:37.815 --> 34:39.416
_

34:39.416 --> 34:45.667
_

34:45.725 --> 34:47.926
Hurry.

34:59.139 --> 35:00.171
(DOOR OPENS)

35:00.173 --> 35:01.472
Misha.

35:01.474 --> 35:02.707
Stop.

35:02.709 --> 35:04.585
I thought you wanted this for New York.

35:04.587 --> 35:05.610
The Russians changed the location,

35:05.612 --> 35:07.512
so we changed the plan.

35:08.515 --> 35:09.714
The conference is happening

35:09.716 --> 35:12.135
right there, right now.

35:14.554 --> 35:16.287
You're gonna shoot it.

35:16.289 --> 35:18.690
Third floor of that building, now.

35:19.351 --> 35:20.758
Go.

35:26.600 --> 35:28.800
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

35:32.280 --> 35:35.039
It'd have to be in a neighboring
building with enough elevation.

35:36.376 --> 35:37.909
My guess is, uh...

35:37.911 --> 35:39.377
Where?

35:39.379 --> 35:40.778
There.

35:40.780 --> 35:42.914
We are not done evacuating.

35:42.916 --> 35:45.516
- I'm taking my team in.
- I'll be five minutes.

35:45.518 --> 35:46.918
- Four!
- It's your call,

35:46.920 --> 35:49.255
but with five, I get everyone out alive.

35:55.428 --> 35:57.395
No. No way.

35:57.397 --> 35:59.464
(CHUCKLES) Listen.

35:59.466 --> 36:01.266
Either you shoot it...

36:01.268 --> 36:03.901
or I kill Bridget and
your beautiful baby.

36:04.838 --> 36:06.337
Oh, don't do it, Steve.

36:18.218 --> 36:21.823
Shoot it, Stefan, or they are both dead.

36:21.825 --> 36:23.554
There are hundreds of people

36:23.556 --> 36:25.189
in that building over there.

36:27.994 --> 36:29.494
Val. (SPEAKS IN UKRAINIAN)

36:30.864 --> 36:31.929
Take it.

36:31.931 --> 36:33.331
Take it!

36:38.344 --> 36:39.871
Steve.

36:40.390 --> 36:42.273
- He's gonna kill you.
- No, Steve,

36:42.275 --> 36:43.775
look at me. You're a cop.

36:43.777 --> 36:44.942
You're a cop.

36:44.944 --> 36:47.211
You can't kill hundreds

36:47.213 --> 36:49.047
to save two. Steve, put it down.

36:49.049 --> 36:50.381
Come on, Stefan.

36:56.923 --> 36:58.456
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

37:04.764 --> 37:07.699
Steve. Put it down.

37:17.177 --> 37:19.679
MISHA: Stefan, fire it!

37:26.245 --> 37:27.645
(EXHALES)

37:30.223 --> 37:31.733
No.

37:35.228 --> 37:36.661
(SCOFFS)

37:36.663 --> 37:38.396
You're such a disappointment.

37:39.199 --> 37:40.998
(GROANS)

37:42.068 --> 37:43.267
Val.

37:43.269 --> 37:45.136
Keep your gun on her.

37:45.138 --> 37:47.038
He's alive. Let me call an ambulance.

37:47.040 --> 37:48.573
Be patient, there's gonna be

37:48.575 --> 37:50.608
lots of ambulance here soon.

37:53.146 --> 37:54.846
ERIC: All right, before you fire that...

37:54.848 --> 37:55.847
Who are you?

37:55.849 --> 37:57.382
Eric Beaumont. We spoke on the phone.

37:57.384 --> 37:59.183
- I am unarmed.
- Ah, Mr. Beaumont.

37:59.185 --> 38:00.651
The negotiator.

38:00.653 --> 38:02.019
You are right on time.

38:02.021 --> 38:03.788
All right, there are
German police downstairs,

38:03.790 --> 38:05.723
snipers on all the roofs.

38:05.725 --> 38:07.458
They gave me four minutes
to get you to surrender,

38:07.460 --> 38:09.060
and then they're coming in.

38:10.063 --> 38:12.497
- Four minutes?
- Mm-hmm.

38:12.499 --> 38:14.232
That's plenty of time.

38:14.234 --> 38:15.833
All right, think about
what you're doing here.

38:15.835 --> 38:17.769
You pull the trigger,

38:17.771 --> 38:19.370
you will end up dead
or in prison, and then

38:19.372 --> 38:20.638
you can't advance your cause.

38:20.640 --> 38:22.473
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

38:28.214 --> 38:29.547
ZARA: Eric,

38:29.549 --> 38:32.316
I think I understand what Misha means.

38:32.318 --> 38:35.119
Misha. Steve isn't my boyfriend.

38:35.121 --> 38:37.688
I can't tell you how many times
I've imagined him dead.

38:37.690 --> 38:39.657
But now that he's lying here, bleeding,

38:39.659 --> 38:41.426
I don't feel better, I feel worse.

38:41.428 --> 38:42.560
That's your problem.

38:46.332 --> 38:47.999
Your wife and children are gone.

38:48.001 --> 38:49.921
Murdering innocent people

38:49.923 --> 38:51.402
won't bring them back.

38:51.404 --> 38:53.304
No, but it will bring me justice.

38:53.306 --> 38:54.760
No, you'll have revenge, Misha.

38:57.097 --> 38:58.481
ZARA: <i>Killing innocent people...</i>

38:58.483 --> 39:00.878
is that what your wife
would want you to do?

39:00.880 --> 39:02.046
You don't know my wife!

39:02.048 --> 39:03.114
And you will never know her,

39:03.116 --> 39:04.916
because she was murdered.

39:04.918 --> 39:06.384
I can tell how much you love her.

39:06.386 --> 39:08.496
And your kids.

39:10.190 --> 39:11.786
You don't know me, either.

39:11.788 --> 39:13.658
- Misha, let's do it.
- Look, every one of those people

39:13.660 --> 39:15.893
over there has family, friends.

39:15.895 --> 39:17.595
They'll just want revenge, too.

39:17.597 --> 39:19.639
No one is dead, you can both
walk out of here alive.

39:19.641 --> 39:20.765
Don't kill, Misha,

39:20.767 --> 39:22.333
and don't die, either.

39:22.335 --> 39:24.435
Be there to see real justice.

39:24.437 --> 39:26.771
(CHUCKLES)

39:27.841 --> 39:29.907
You are so naive. Real justice?

39:29.909 --> 39:32.076
Will my wife and my children ever know

39:32.078 --> 39:33.478
any real justice?

39:33.480 --> 39:34.814
I don't know.

39:35.381 --> 39:37.982
But must hundreds more have
to suffer the way you have?

39:42.155 --> 39:44.115
When will it end, Misha?

39:54.167 --> 39:55.700
Misha, what are you doing?
