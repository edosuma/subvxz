Inspector, it's me, Julia.

15:55.371 --> 15:57.081
I'm sorry to call again,

15:57.164 --> 15:59.917
but I would really like to know
if you took the train home.

16:00.125 --> 16:05.005
Or if, like our witness,
you vanished into thin air.

16:08.342 --> 16:10.177
[groaning]

16:12.179 --> 16:13.222
You.

16:14.348 --> 16:15.724
Yes, it is me.

16:16.058 --> 16:18.560
You are fortunate
that I found you when I did.

16:18.894 --> 16:20.020
As a baby.

16:20.396 --> 16:22.523
By the side of a road in Argentina.

16:23.482 --> 16:25.776
Oh, I always knew it was you.

16:30.197 --> 16:32.741
Please, the air is very thin up here.

16:32.908 --> 16:34.493
You need oxygen.

16:35.369 --> 16:40.249
Okay, let us pretend
that I believe your conspiracy stories.

16:40.874 --> 16:44.336
Why would I bother helping you
find Carmen Sandiego?

16:44.420 --> 16:46.296
I am already with Interpol.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.257

16:48.340 --> 16:51.218

17:07.693 --> 17:10.612
I encouraged your colleagues
to explore the fish market

17:10.696 --> 17:13.866
since they knew little
about treating altitude sickness.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.994
Yes, I followed you.

17:17.411 --> 17:20.956
Did you think I would trust
a possible scavenger with my coin?

17:21.498 --> 17:25.169
Doctor, if I'm to have any hope
of retrieving your doubloon,

17:25.252 --> 17:27.046

Are these the tools
of an amateur coin hobbyist?

You helped me.

17:40.559 --> 17:42.728
Please, allow me to help you.

17:46.273 --> 17:49.610
Oh, find that coin already, sis!
I can't breathe in here.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.904
If you don't put a sock in it,
Zack-Attack,

17:51.987 --> 17:53.781
I'm gonna put a fish in it for you.

18:05.375 --> 18:08.045
Well, look what just waltzed in.
Red snapper.

18:10.464 --> 18:13.967
Hey, don't be embarrassed, Carm.
The smell of fish gets me woozy, too.

18:14.301 --> 18:16.095
-Tell me you found it.
-[Ivy] Yep.

18:16.261 --> 18:19.807
We've been scanning the tuna carts on deck
for the auction floor first

18:19.890 --> 18:22.101
to make sure it didn't get past us.

18:22.184 --> 18:23.644
It's in that one over there.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.605
The one they just wheeled
through those doors?

18:28.982 --> 18:29.983
[both gasp]

18:30.442 --> 18:32.778
Three hundred once.
Three hundred twice.

18:33.112 --> 18:36.406
Lot 51, sold to paddle number seven.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.202
-Le Chevre.
-[Ivy] Again?

18:41.286 --> 18:43.288
That guy really gets my goat.

18:43.372 --> 18:46.041
He'd ID me in an instant,
with or without the coat.

18:46.708 --> 18:48.168
You two need to reel it in.

18:48.502 --> 18:50.712
-How?
-Bid to win.

18:51.964 --> 18:56.885
Lot number 52:
yellowfin tuna, 97 pounds.

18:57.094 --> 18:58.387
That's our guppy.

18:58.762 --> 19:02.015
Starting at $100.
Do I hear $100?

19:02.266 --> 19:05.269
One hundred dollars.
Do I hear $150?

$150,000!

What? She said "bid to win."

19:22.035 --> 19:22.953
I just won.

19:23.453 --> 19:25.289
Not how it works, bro.

Now, now, now!

20:04.995 --> 20:07.247
That doubloon isn't worth
what you think it is.

20:07.331 --> 20:09.750
Stealing it would deprive Ecuador
of a cultural treasure.

Interesting to hear,

During your fever, you mistook me
