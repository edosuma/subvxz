39:39.417 --> 39:42.537
It's a long day, huh?

39:42.576 --> 39:43.720
Long night.

39:43.754 --> 39:45.388
- Yeah.
- Long week.

39:45.423 --> 39:50.393
Mac, Ananya, Xavier
Arnold, it brings stuff up.

39:50.428 --> 39:53.941
It's that battle, huh? The
one that T.C. mentioned.

39:53.972 --> 39:57.400
Taji Qasr? Yeah.

39:57.435 --> 39:58.935
Lost a buddy of mine... Shea.

39:58.970 --> 40:03.173
All he needed was a Burr
Hole to relieve the pressure.

40:03.199 --> 40:07.269
If I knew then what I
knew now, but I failed him.

40:07.311 --> 40:10.647
So I promised myself I
wouldn't let that happen again.

40:10.681 --> 40:13.683
- Hmm.
- That's why I became a doctor.

40:13.718 --> 40:16.853
And Xavier Arnold... He was there?

40:16.896 --> 40:19.593
About 10 minutes too late.

40:19.616 --> 40:21.223
If he was where he was supposed to be,

40:21.225 --> 40:23.193
then maybe Shea would still be alive.

40:23.227 --> 40:25.762
But if he wasn't there at all,

40:25.796 --> 40:28.865
then maybe <i>you</i> wouldn't be here.

40:28.900 --> 40:32.802
♪

40:32.837 --> 40:35.372
I never finished this
movie. Not since that day.

40:35.406 --> 40:37.674
It's like time stopped.

40:40.745 --> 40:43.146
Can't bring myself to finish it.

40:44.682 --> 40:48.852
[Inhales deeply]
Well, I've never seen it.

40:48.886 --> 40:51.788
Do you mind if I watch it with you?
