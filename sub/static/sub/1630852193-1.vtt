JASON: <i>For some reason, we'd brought</i>
<i>this more leisure-type,</i>

1:32:45.916 --> 1:32:47.291
<i>full-faced mask too.</i>

1:32:47.833 --> 1:32:50.875
<i>Compared to the other ones,</i>
<i>it looked like a little pink toy.</i>

1:32:51.500 --> 1:32:54.541
<i>And when we tried cranking the straps</i>
<i>down on this leisure mask,</i>

1:32:54.625 --> 1:32:55.791
the seal collapsed.

1:32:56.791 --> 1:32:58.291
<i>And then water entered.</i>

1:32:59.583 --> 1:33:02.958
So we backed it off, tried it again,
then it collapsed again.

1:33:03.208 --> 1:33:06.375
<i>It just sat on his face, and you knew</i>
<i>that if it took a sideways knock,</i>

1:33:06.458 --> 1:33:07.833
<i>that would have been curtains.</i>

1:33:11.125 --> 1:33:14.166
Jason, I could see
was very unhappy about it.

1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:19.916
<i>The very last child and I was thinking,</i>

1:33:20.083 --> 1:33:23.166
"Poor Jason," you know? "The last kid
is gonna be the one to drown,"

1:33:23.333 --> 1:33:25.833
"and Jason's gonna have
to deal with that."

1:33:27.916 --> 1:33:30.375
<i>I had to go so slowly, so carefully.</i>

1:33:38.500 --> 1:33:39.750
<i>We were waiting and waiting</i>

1:33:39.833 --> 1:33:43.250
and Chris didn't come,
so that was quite anxious.

1:33:46.916 --> 1:33:51.000
CHRIS: <i>Despite sweeping around</i>
<i>in the water to try and find this rope,</i>

1:33:51.750 --> 1:33:55.708
<i>I couldn't find it.</i>
<i>I kept finding electrical cable.</i>

1:33:58.125 --> 1:34:00.791
<i>That electrical cable</i>
<i>probably goes back to Chamber Three.</i>

1:34:01.916 --> 1:34:03.416
<i>So, I started following it.</i>

1:34:06.833 --> 1:34:10.666
<i>After, I guess, what was ten minutes,</i>
<i>I popped up into a chamber.</i>

1:34:11.500 --> 1:34:12.833
<i>I was confused.</i>

1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:18.333
<i>I was expecting to surface</i>
<i>in Chamber Three,</i>

1:34:18.416 --> 1:34:22.500
<i>where the rescue workers were.</i>
<i>I surfaced in a chamber that was empty.</i>

1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:24.041
Hello!

1:34:25.791 --> 1:34:27.000
Hello!

1:34:28.083 --> 1:34:29.291

1:34:34.708 --> 1:34:37.875

<i>an unknown chamber,</i>

1:34:37.958 --> 1:34:39.500
<i>completely off the main route,</i>

1:34:40.083 --> 1:34:41.625
<i>nobody's gonna come and find us.</i>

1:34:51.708 --> 1:34:54.875
JASON: <i>I surfaced in the last air chamber</i>
<i>with the child,</i>

1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:58.000
<i>and immediately in front of me,</i>
<i>there was this apparition of Chris,</i>

1:34:58.083 --> 1:34:59.625
<i>and there was a child at his feet.</i>

1:34:59.708 --> 1:35:01.916
<i>And my immediate thought was,</i>
<i>"We've lost one of them."</i>

1:35:02.250 --> 1:35:06.875
When I saw Jason,
I realized I'd gone backwards in the cave.

1:35:07.041 --> 1:35:08.666
I realized I was back in Chamber Four.

1:35:10.333 --> 1:35:14.208
<i>Jason headed into the final section,</i>
<i>and then Harry appeared.</i>

1:35:16.250 --> 1:35:19.125
I said, "Look, mate,
you just stay here, gather your thoughts,

1:35:19.208 --> 1:35:22.000
"I'll take the kid out in the last bit.
You come through when you're ready."

1:35:28.041 --> 1:35:29.958
JASON: <i>When I hear the humming</i>
<i>of the pump, I knew</i>

1:35:30.041 --> 1:35:32.916
<i>I'm nearly at Chamber Three.</i>
<i>Just before I handed the kid over,</i>

1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:35.708
I got a lump in my throat,
'cause I knew he was gonna be out alive.

1:35:37.375 --> 1:35:40.541
Okay, three, two, one.

1:35:45.500 --> 1:35:48.041
RICK: <i>When we heard Harry</i>
<i>was bringing Chris's boy forward,</i>

1:35:48.250 --> 1:35:49.333
<i>I was confident in Harry</i>

1:35:49.458 --> 1:35:52.166
and pleased for him as well,
that he was able to experience that.

1:35:54.916 --> 1:35:57.208
<i>There was these big guys</i>
<i>from the U.S. Air Force there,</i>

1:35:57.541 --> 1:35:58.958
grabbing the kid off you.

1:35:59.833 --> 1:36:02.666
<i>Whisking him into a stretcher</i>
<i>and off up the hill.</i>

1:36:02.875 --> 1:36:04.250
<i>And then he's just gone.</i>

1:36:08.333 --> 1:36:11.125
Suddenly, the mood was just amazing.

1:36:13.125 --> 1:36:15.000
<i>Passing around a bottle of Jack Daniels...</i>

1:36:16.291 --> 1:36:17.666

1:36:18.958 --> 1:36:20.333
<i>Bloody done this, I can't believe it.</i>

1:36:23.125 --> 1:36:26.750
I knew the Thai Navy guys
and Dr. Bhak still had to come out

1:36:26.833 --> 1:36:30.333
and we were still worried about them.
I mean, they still had a challenging dive.

1:36:31.291 --> 1:36:34.375
<i>And suddenly there's this cry</i>
<i>of something's going wrong.</i>

1:36:34.625 --> 1:36:37.666
One of the main pumps
in Chamber Three burst

1:36:37.791 --> 1:36:40.041
and just started spewing water everywhere.

1:36:42.666 --> 1:36:44.708

<i>Oh, my God, it's rising really fast.</i>

1:36:44.791 --> 1:36:47.291

we need to get out of here.

1:36:49.250 --> 1:36:51.041

<i>on just two more SEALs</i>

1:36:51.125 --> 1:36:53.583

1:36:53.666 --> 1:36:56.791
<i>-those SEALs came out.</i>
-MIKKO: <i>Then the whole chamber flooded.</i>

1:36:57.000 --> 1:36:59.500
We just barely got out
by holding our breath.

1:37:02.083 --> 1:37:04.750

and then suddenly, she's burst into tears.

And yeah, she tells my dad's just died,
literally a couple of hours ago.

1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:59.125

it was this huge swing of emotions,
