WEBVTT

00:03.837 --> 00:06.538
Hey.
What's for breakfast?

00:06.573 --> 00:07.839
Just liquids for me,

00:07.874 --> 00:10.809
and not the fun kind
that come in a beer bottle.

00:10.844 --> 00:13.845
Ooh, you're doing
a cleanse.

00:13.880 --> 00:14.946
That's so much work.

00:14.981 --> 00:16.882
You know, I heard that Rihanna
just gets new blood.

00:16.917 --> 00:18.250
Much easier.

00:18.285 --> 00:21.753
Actually, it's prep
for a colonoscopy.

00:21.788 --> 00:24.289
Less of a cleanse,
more of a purge.

00:25.559 --> 00:27.759
Yep, I got to get
my pipes cleaned out

00:27.794 --> 00:30.328
so my doctor can take
a high-definition video

00:30.363 --> 00:32.597
of my fire escape.

00:32.632 --> 00:33.698
You know what?

00:33.733 --> 00:36.435
You've been so disgusting
for so long,

00:36.470 --> 00:38.303
it's actually
stopped bothering me.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.339
I thought you were playing poker
with the guys tonight.

00:41.374 --> 00:43.875
I am. We're gonna do
this prep together.

00:43.910 --> 00:46.779
You know what they say --
dysentery<i> loves</i> company.

00:48.215 --> 00:49.848
We got this
on a funny video

00:49.883 --> 00:52.384
with Martin Short, Tom Hanks,
and Steve Martin.

00:52.419 --> 00:54.219
I've never heard of them.

00:55.755 --> 00:57.722
-Hey, guys. Good morning.
-Good morning. Good morning.

00:57.757 --> 00:58.757
What's up?

00:58.792 --> 01:00.725
Well, Ryan and Boyd
are off to Canada

01:00.760 --> 01:02.561
to see
the Hockey Hall of Fame.

01:02.596 --> 01:03.628
Wow.
- Pfft.

01:03.663 --> 01:06.798
In France, they think the Louvre
is a museum.

01:06.833 --> 01:09.534
The vegan's gone,
and I want some meat.

01:09.569 --> 01:11.236
Why isn't there any bacon?

01:11.271 --> 01:13.605
Dad's not eating.
He's draining his swamp.

01:13.640 --> 01:15.307
(laughs)

01:15.342 --> 01:16.741
Colonoscopy tomorrow.

01:16.776 --> 01:20.112
Oh, good thing you<i> love</i> having
your picture taken.

01:20.147 --> 01:21.413
(chuckles)

01:21.448 --> 01:23.715
Yeah, you know what? I'll put it
on my driver's license.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.785
People are gonna say,
"Have you lost weight?"

01:26.820 --> 01:27.786
Hey, you know what?

01:27.821 --> 01:28.753
Since the guys
aren't gonna be here,

01:28.788 --> 01:29.821
we should have
a slumber party

01:29.856 --> 01:31.123
like we used to do
when we were kids.

01:31.158 --> 01:32.557
Oh,
those were so much fun.

01:32.592 --> 01:34.659
Up all night,
talking about what boys like me,

01:34.694 --> 01:36.628
what boys
probably like me.

01:37.697 --> 01:39.164
-Oh, hey, Kris.
-Hey, morning.

01:39.199 --> 01:40.465
Morning, sweetie.
Mom, Kris and Eve and I

01:40.500 --> 01:41.800
are gonna have a slumber party
here tonight.

01:41.835 --> 01:44.169
That okay with you?
I would love to.

01:44.204 --> 01:46.338
What?

01:46.373 --> 01:48.440
Hey,
that sounds like fun --

01:48.475 --> 01:50.642
a slumber party
with your mom.

01:50.677 --> 01:51.676
You know what?

01:51.711 --> 01:54.079
We -- We could do
arts and crafts.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.981
(gasps)
I have tons of felt.

01:56.016 --> 01:57.282
Oh, wow.

01:57.317 --> 01:58.950
Bye, honey.
- Bye.

01:58.985 --> 02:00.785
You know what?

02:00.820 --> 02:03.055
I think your party's gonna be
worse than mine.

02:11.898 --> 02:13.698
I'm all set for tonight,
man.

02:13.733 --> 02:15.100
Got my poker set

02:15.135 --> 02:18.203
and 62 ounces
of liquid plumber.

02:18.238 --> 02:19.337
(chuckles)

02:19.372 --> 02:20.705
Scared?

02:20.740 --> 02:22.874
I'm a Marine.

02:22.909 --> 02:24.009
Yes.

02:25.412 --> 02:29.081
Well, you should be.
It's like a tsunami in a bottle.

02:31.585 --> 02:33.552
What?
- Hey, Mr. B., this came for you.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.387
I had to sign for it
and everything.

02:35.422 --> 02:38.056
It's a big-boy day
for you, huh, Kyle?

02:38.091 --> 02:41.293
The Explorers Museum.
Oh, that's great.

02:41.328 --> 02:44.129
Yes, it is.
Yes, it is!

02:44.164 --> 02:47.399
Finally, they want me
to submit an artifact.

02:47.434 --> 02:49.201
Oh, and your name
will be immortalized

02:49.236 --> 02:50.735
with all those
famous explorers,

02:50.770 --> 02:52.904
like that guy who found
that thing on the mountain

02:52.939 --> 02:55.340
or that lady who pulled
that doohickey from the river.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.377
Their names live on and on,
don't they?

02:59.412 --> 03:01.413
Hey, what are you
gonna submit?

03:01.448 --> 03:03.848
This 1,000-year-old
spearhead.

03:03.883 --> 03:06.685
I found it
in a Honduran rainforest.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.887
Came from
a lost civilization.

03:08.922 --> 03:11.756
Wow. I can't believe they let you
take that out of the country.

03:11.791 --> 03:14.392
Well, the Hondurans
are a very trusting people.

03:14.427 --> 03:15.894
They trust it
when you tell them at Customs,

03:15.929 --> 03:17.563
"Yeah, I got that
at a gift shop."

03:19.532 --> 03:21.233
Wait a minute.
There's Ed.

03:21.268 --> 03:22.667
I got to show him this.

03:22.702 --> 03:24.169
Oh, he's gonna be
really happy for you.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.738
No, he's wanted this forever.
It's gonna kill him.

03:26.773 --> 03:29.441
I love that you two like to
make each other miserable.

03:29.476 --> 03:30.642
It's called friendship,
Kyle.

03:31.945 --> 03:33.511
Hey, Ed,
I got some big news.

03:33.546 --> 03:35.213
Want to read you
something here.

03:35.248 --> 03:36.147
Not today, Mike.

03:36.183 --> 03:38.250
I'm just -- I'm not in the mood.
I'm sorry.

03:38.285 --> 03:39.684
I'll just read you a little --
- I --

03:39.719 --> 03:42.420
This is the day
that the Explorers Museum

03:42.455 --> 03:44.222
sends out their invitations.

03:44.257 --> 03:46.057
And I did not
get an envelope.

03:46.092 --> 03:47.959
And I bet you think
there's not a bit of news

03:47.994 --> 03:49.561
that could make you feel
any worse.

03:49.596 --> 03:51.630
You're right.
There isn't. No.

03:51.665 --> 03:53.698
It's never gonna happen
for me.

03:53.733 --> 03:56.234
Well, you didn't have to
say it like that.

03:56.269 --> 03:57.769
No.
No, who am I kidding?

03:57.804 --> 03:59.804
Come on.
I'm not a real outdoorsman.

03:59.839 --> 04:02.774
I'm a rich wannabe who sells
equipment to the real ones.

04:02.809 --> 04:04.109
Yeah. (chuckles)

04:04.144 --> 04:06.311
Hey, Mr. Alzate, what's worse --
- Yeah?

04:06.346 --> 04:09.514
Mr. B. getting in the Explorers
Museum or his zingers? Ooh.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.151
You got invited?

04:13.186 --> 04:15.754
Yeah, that was the news.
Look, Ed, sorry.

04:15.789 --> 04:17.422
But you know
what's gonna happen?

04:17.457 --> 04:19.891
You're gonna get in because
you're a great, great man.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.693
Oh, direct hit!

04:22.996 --> 04:25.430
I'm very happy for you, Mike.
Yes, I am.

There's nothing better
than seeing a friend

receive an honor that...

04:28.702 --> 04:30.636
you've wanted
your entire adult life.

04:33.873 --> 04:35.907
Man, the zingers

our Mother's Day brunch?

There she is,

what every great party needs --
a chaperone.

05:06.840 --> 05:11.142
Uh, well, would a chaperone
bring a...

How about (gasps)
tiramisu?

I have tira-missed you.

Ryan Gosling
build a house...

shirtless?!
- That's how - all houses should be built.

Hmm.

05:40.874 --> 05:43.675
And which one of you
likes wine?

a complete...

Clorox bottles into piggy banks.

I'm kidding.

06:12.739 --> 06:16.174
Hey, Mr. B., I -- I still
feel really bad

06:16.209 --> 06:18.543
about spilling the beans
to Mr. Alzate.

06:18.578 --> 06:21.780
You got to stop
apologizing for this.

06:21.815 --> 06:25.216
Although that "I'm sorry" Jell-O
was kind of fun.

06:25.251 --> 06:28.586
Well, I went with lime 'cause
it's the most apologetic flavor

06:28.621 --> 06:30.422
and strawberries
for grieving

06:30.457 --> 06:32.924
and orange is, obviously,
for graduations.

06:33.793 --> 06:35.627
Well, no matter
what color they are,

He's gonna be fine.

06:41.167 --> 06:43.635
I felt really bad for him,
so I called the museum,

06:43.670 --> 06:45.403
and they're gonna change
the award

06:45.438 --> 06:48.072
to include<i> all</i> of Outdoor Man
so he'll feel part of it.

06:48.107 --> 06:49.707
Does that mean I'm included,
too?

06:49.742 --> 06:50.875

from the Explorers Museum.

06:59.919 --> 07:00.919
Yeah?

Turns out you were wrong.

Well, that doesn't
sound like me.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.289
It sure doesn't.

07:04.324 --> 07:06.291
Don't need any help.

You know, it's good
to see you happy, though.

07:15.702 --> 07:17.735
Yeah. And I know exactly what
I'm gonna submit.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.938
Good.
- My spearhead.

07:21.007 --> 07:22.374
<i>Your</i> spearhead?

"Donated by Ed Alzate
of Ed Alzate's Outdoor Man."

your stolen artifact.

07:42.829 --> 07:46.298
What's the Jell-O color
for betrayal?

07:47.834 --> 07:49.568
Grape.

07:56.042 --> 07:57.809
Great thing
about this poker game is

07:57.844 --> 08:00.111
I don't have to bring beer
or chips or anything.

08:00.146 --> 08:03.982
I mean, not that I would anyway,
but this time, it's not rude.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.819
Tonight, anyone can use
<i>any</i> bathroom.

This is not North Carolina.

Anything to add,
Baxter?

08:12.425 --> 08:14.859
Yeah, and this is coming

08:21.868 --> 08:22.867
No, no, I'm not gonna.

08:22.902 --> 08:24.669
As important as
that spear is to me,

08:24.704 --> 08:27.305
I think it's important to let
the boss have a win, right?

08:27.340 --> 08:28.506
Wow.

08:28.541 --> 08:30.375
You know, if the guy
who had found that thing

08:30.410 --> 08:31.743
on the mountain
felt that way,

08:31.778 --> 08:33.578
his name would have been
totally forgotten.

08:35.782 --> 08:38.350
You know, this isn't so bad.
I salted the rim.

08:40.119 --> 08:42.320
So, shall we start?

08:42.355 --> 08:43.888
All right.

08:43.923 --> 08:45.857
Kyle, you know your job?
Yep.

08:45.892 --> 08:47.692
When someone gets up
to go to the bathroom,

08:47.727 --> 08:49.260
I jump in
and play their hand.

08:49.295 --> 08:51.396
And?
- Try not to be a dumbass.

08:51.431 --> 08:53.398
Exactly.

08:53.433 --> 08:55.400
Gentlemen, another toast.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.970

Oh, wow.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.690
Amazing.
He runs pretty fast.

09:18.725 --> 09:21.359
I can't believe
he can't catch a shoplifter.

09:21.394 --> 09:24.028
All right, let's see what
Mr. Larabee's got.

09:24.063 --> 09:26.731
Mm-hmm.
- Oh, man.

09:26.766 --> 09:29.601
I mean...oh, man!

09:31.270 --> 09:32.304
All in.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.741
So, um, Joe,
did you hear?

09:36.776 --> 09:39.077
I've been asked to submit
to the Explorers Museum.

09:39.112 --> 09:41.079
Well, technically,
the store has been asked.

09:41.114 --> 09:43.248
Mm,
sounds like sour grapes.

09:44.917 --> 09:47.251
Not sour grapes.
I'm just trying to be accurate.

09:47.286 --> 09:50.388
You know, the last museum
I went to was incredible.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.590
I mean,
the Tom Cruise was so lifelike,

09:52.625 --> 09:55.026
you could almost bend over
and pat his head.

09:59.499 --> 10:01.399
Yeah, I'm gonna submit
a spearhead

10:01.434 --> 10:03.601
that I found while hiking
in a rainforest in Brazil.

10:03.636 --> 10:05.136
It was Honduras.

10:06.172 --> 10:08.406
I think
I know my rainforests.

10:08.441 --> 10:11.309
Do you? 'Cause they're
in different hemispheres.

10:11.344 --> 10:13.778
They don't even have the same
species of monkey in them.

10:13.813 --> 10:16.247
Well, at least they both
have monkeys.

10:16.282 --> 10:18.316
Our country blows.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.954
I remember it perfectly.
It was a full moon.

10:22.989 --> 10:23.955
Midday.

10:23.990 --> 10:26.157
It was the height
of the rainy season.

10:26.192 --> 10:28.359
Bone dry!

10:28.394 --> 10:29.994
Who's telling the story?

10:30.029 --> 10:31.596
Well, you're telling some story,
but not the real story.

10:31.631 --> 10:36.200
Look, I found that spearhead
in Honduras, midday, bone-dry.

10:36.235 --> 10:38.803
You were up in the cantina
with some woman named Maria.

10:41.374 --> 10:43.041
That can't be right.

10:43.076 --> 10:44.108
That's exactly what --

10:44.143 --> 10:45.510
Oh, boy.
Here comes the judge.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.450
Oh. What'd I miss?

10:52.485 --> 10:55.820
Oh, Ed grabbed a spearhead
from a monkey in a cantina.

10:57.256 --> 10:59.624
♪♪

10:59.659 --> 11:01.059
So, then Travis
told me about

11:01.094 --> 11:02.827
this college party
over in Boulder.

11:02.862 --> 11:03.895
Really?

11:03.930 --> 11:06.230
Yeah, and then
I was like,

11:06.265 --> 11:09.167
"No, I got to get home
for my curfew."

11:11.904 --> 11:14.305
And then I did.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.174
Yet I recall
a different story --

11:16.209 --> 11:18.242
You giving me 10 bucks
to stuff pillows in your bed

11:18.277 --> 11:19.377
so Mom thought
you were home.

11:19.412 --> 11:20.678
(laughs loudly)

11:20.713 --> 11:23.514
Aah.
- Ahh, memories!

11:23.549 --> 11:26.250
Funny, fuzzy,
conflicting memories.

11:26.285 --> 11:28.653
Oh, come on.
I knew about that.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.155
I just -- I trusted you
to make good decisions.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.590
Why?

11:32.625 --> 11:35.593
I -- You're only
a teenager once.

11:35.628 --> 11:37.361
When did you get so cool?

11:37.396 --> 11:40.231
Yeah, why are you so good
at hiding it?

11:40.266 --> 11:42.867
(scoffs)
I have always been cool.

11:42.902 --> 11:47.505
Listen, one time
at a John Tesh concert...

11:47.540 --> 11:51.843
he brought one girl
up on stage to sing to,

11:51.878 --> 11:54.011
and it was
<i>my</i> best friend Karen.

11:54.046 --> 11:55.012
Wow.

11:55.047 --> 11:56.347
To Mom.

11:56.382 --> 11:58.783
(glasses clinking)
(laughter)

11:58.818 --> 11:59.917
Oh, you know what?

11:59.952 --> 12:02.019
I am -- I am just loving
this new stage we're at,

12:02.054 --> 12:04.789
you know, where I'm not just your
mom, but I'm also your friend.

12:04.824 --> 12:05.924
(sighs)

12:07.160 --> 12:08.726
(clears throat)

12:08.761 --> 12:10.561
So, what --
what usually happens now?

12:10.596 --> 12:13.131
Well, when we were kids,
by this time, you'd be upstairs,

12:13.166 --> 12:16.033
yelling, "Keep it down, girls!"
- Yeah.

12:16.068 --> 12:17.235
And then
when you went to sleep up there,

12:17.270 --> 12:18.736
the party got turnt
down here.

12:18.771 --> 12:19.737
MANDY: Oh, yeah.

12:19.772 --> 12:21.439
It was so much fun.

12:21.474 --> 12:23.474
We'd prank-call the neighbors,
watch R-rated movies.

12:23.509 --> 12:26.277
Remember sneaking out to 7-Eleven
to buy junk food? Oh, yeah.

12:26.312 --> 12:27.578
(chuckles)

12:27.613 --> 12:29.413
But this is also fun.

12:29.448 --> 12:30.414
We could do that.

12:30.449 --> 12:31.582
Let's -- Let's sneak out now

12:31.617 --> 12:34.652
and get our Cool Ranch Doritos
on.

12:34.687 --> 12:35.753
(laughs)

12:35.788 --> 12:38.623
Yeah, but, like, you're here
and you're okay with it,

12:38.658 --> 12:42.226
so now it would just be
an errand.

12:42.261 --> 12:45.096
Well, uh, you want to -- you
want to watch an R-rated movie?

12:45.131 --> 12:49.066
Uh, been over 17
for a lot of years now.

12:49.101 --> 12:51.569
Well, um...
Ooh, how 'bout X-rated?

12:51.604 --> 12:53.171
What?!
- Mom!

12:54.507 --> 12:58.476
♪♪

12:58.511 --> 12:59.677
So, something happens
with the camera,

12:59.712 --> 13:01.279
and they can't get it out!

13:01.314 --> 13:02.914
(laughs)

13:02.949 --> 13:06.317
My buddy's lying there
for an hour, maybe two.

13:06.352 --> 13:09.253
Then the doctor comes in
with these big tongs!

13:09.288 --> 13:11.455
(laughs)

13:11.490 --> 13:14.993
Why -- Why -- Why are we talking
about this for?

13:17.396 --> 13:19.330
You were telling Chuck
he has nothing to worry about.

13:19.365 --> 13:21.966
Oh!
Right, right.

13:22.001 --> 13:23.768
In fact, to this day,

13:23.803 --> 13:27.038
he only serves salad
with two big spoons.

13:27.073 --> 13:28.139
(laughs)

13:29.742 --> 13:32.377
Oh, boy.
Here comes Santa Claus.

13:32.578 --> 13:35.613
Hey. Hey, w-who's been
drinking my prep?

13:35.648 --> 13:37.048
Oh, I don't know.

13:37.083 --> 13:39.150
Oh, yes, I do.

13:40.686 --> 13:43.855
Great. Now I won't have enough
of this stuff to get the job...

13:43.890 --> 13:44.889
Excuse me.

13:48.227 --> 13:49.961
(chuckles)

13:49.996 --> 13:52.664
These guys are gonna be so mad.
I locked the door.

14:01.507 --> 14:02.640
If you don't mind,

14:02.675 --> 14:05.176
I'd like to sit in silence
until they return.

14:05.211 --> 14:08.012
Ed, I didn't mean to bust
your chops, okay?

14:08.047 --> 14:09.981
Okay, that's it.
I'm out of here.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.183
You're gonna have an accident,
not the good kind

14:12.218 --> 14:14.218
where you run into a Buick.

14:14.253 --> 14:18.089
I'll be fine
because this is not prep.

14:18.124 --> 14:19.523
It's iced tea.

14:19.558 --> 14:21.225
Why?

14:21.260 --> 14:23.527
I'm not having
a colonoscopy.

14:23.562 --> 14:25.062
What's the point?

14:25.097 --> 14:27.365
My days are numbered.

14:36.442 --> 14:38.376
What do you mean
your days are numbered?

14:38.411 --> 14:40.778
Age, Michael.

14:40.813 --> 14:42.113
Every minute of every day,

14:42.148 --> 14:43.948
another cell in my body
gives up,

14:43.983 --> 14:46.083
and I am diminished.

14:46.118 --> 14:48.219
"Michael"?
Oh, boy.

14:48.254 --> 14:51.889
I'm gonna get the full diva.
Here it comes.

14:51.924 --> 14:54.392
How many years
can I possibly have?

14:54.427 --> 14:56.460
Huh? That's why I didn't have
the colonoscopy.

14:56.495 --> 14:58.629
I mean, drinking the prep,
crapping your guts out,

14:58.664 --> 15:02.333
and getting scoped --
That's a young man's game.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.237
Nobody's too old
for a colonoscopy.

15:07.807 --> 15:11.475
I'm forgetting things, Mike,
and it scares me.

15:11.510 --> 15:13.377
Everybody forgets things!

15:13.412 --> 15:15.379
It's very important
that I pick up something

15:15.414 --> 15:17.415
on the way home from work --
haven't a clue.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.216
No.
Those are little things.

15:19.251 --> 15:21.218
I'm in the rainforest,
where my best friend

15:21.253 --> 15:22.486
finds an ancient artifact.

15:22.521 --> 15:24.989
I mean, that's the kind of thing
a man should remember.

15:25.024 --> 15:26.824
You should've remembered
Maria in the cantina.

15:26.859 --> 15:28.626
That's what
you should've remembered.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.430
I have a favor to ask,
Michael.

15:32.465 --> 15:35.733
Going with "Michael" again.
This is gonna be a big one.

15:35.768 --> 15:38.836
I'd still like to submit
that spearhead under my name.

15:38.871 --> 15:40.938
Ed, Ed. - Come on.
- It's too late in the game

15:40.973 --> 15:43.407
for me to go out
and find something on my own.

15:43.442 --> 15:46.844
This is my last shot
at the Explorers Museum.

15:46.879 --> 15:48.846
I think you're forgetting
you're already

15:48.881 --> 15:50.381
<i>in</i> the Explorers Museu.

15:51.884 --> 15:52.850
No, I'm not.

15:52.885 --> 15:55.219
I took a shot.

15:59.191 --> 16:01.258
(laughs) No, wait.

16:01.293 --> 16:04.529
Your refrigerator
is running!

16:07.900 --> 16:10.368
Sorry, Mike.

16:10.403 --> 16:13.804
Yeah, no, I know you're busy.
Okay. I'm sorry.

16:13.839 --> 16:16.207
So, this is great,

16:16.242 --> 16:18.709
but I'm gonna head home
and sleep in my own bed.

16:18.744 --> 16:19.710
No, wait.
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

16:19.745 --> 16:22.179
What -- What about
the sleepover?

16:22.214 --> 16:23.547
It's just not the same,
okay?

16:23.582 --> 16:24.882
This just feels like

16:24.917 --> 16:28.019
adults sleeping on the floor
for no reason.

16:28.054 --> 16:29.887
Yeah,
I'm too old for this.

16:29.922 --> 16:32.490
My sciatica's acting up.

16:33.592 --> 16:35.326
This is silly.
We're not kids anymore.

16:35.361 --> 16:36.961
We can't re-create
the past.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.629
All right, hold on.
You know what?

16:38.664 --> 16:40.031
I'll leave.

16:40.066 --> 16:41.966
I mean, I-I'm the one who's
ruining the sleepover party.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.200
N-No, you're not.

16:43.235 --> 16:46.137
Mm, let the woman talk.

16:46.172 --> 16:48.706
I'm -- I'm ruining it
for me, too.

16:48.741 --> 16:51.308

part of your sleepovers was?

16:51.343 --> 16:54.245
Laying upstairs
and listening to you girls

16:54.280 --> 16:57.348
share stories
and giggling and...

16:57.383 --> 17:00.151
just being sisters.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.186
That's nice.

17:02.221 --> 17:03.654
You were eavesdropping.

17:03.689 --> 17:06.090
(chuckles)

17:06.125 --> 17:09.827
But you're all grown up now,
and I don't get that anymore.

17:09.862 --> 17:13.330
And I just --
I -- I miss that feeling.

17:13.365 --> 17:14.865
So...

17:14.900 --> 17:18.769
So, tonight, for one night,
can I just get it back?

17:18.804 --> 17:22.406
You want us to act like
irresponsible kids again?

17:22.441 --> 17:25.376
I guess I could turn back
the clock to last month.

17:27.646 --> 17:29.113
Thank you.
Thank you.

17:29.148 --> 17:32.216
So, uh, I want you girls
to keep it down,

17:32.251 --> 17:33.951
and lights out by 11:00,

17:33.986 --> 17:37.021
and I am going to
confiscate this.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.122
No, I'm over 21.

17:38.157 --> 17:39.523
I know.
I just want it.

17:39.558 --> 17:40.925
Okay.

17:43.729 --> 17:46.797
So, what do we do now?
I don't know.

17:46.832 --> 17:48.399
I guess we could check
Mom's bag

17:48.434 --> 17:50.534
to see if she actually has
an X-rated movie in there.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.770
Wouldn't be the first time
we rifled through Mom's purse.

17:52.805 --> 17:54.772
Oh, man, remember
when we went to 7-Eleven

17:54.807 --> 17:57.274
and tried to buy stuff
with her insurance card?

17:57.309 --> 18:00.444
♪♪

18:00.479 --> 18:03.447
Hey, we're back.
Thanks for the ride, Kyle.

18:03.482 --> 18:05.149
So, how was it, guys?

18:05.184 --> 18:07.151
Well...

18:07.186 --> 18:09.120
Joe...cried.

18:11.357 --> 18:13.457
It was the anesthesia,
okay?

18:13.492 --> 18:16.427
It happens.

18:16.462 --> 18:18.429
But, you know, it was --
it was very bonding.

18:18.464 --> 18:20.431
I -- I'm thinking this is what
it must be like

18:20.466 --> 18:23.467
for men who went to war
together, you know?

18:23.502 --> 18:25.837
No,
it's nothing like that.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.340
Anyway, it's good to
have a clean bill of health

18:29.375 --> 18:30.941
and get all that crap
out of my system.

18:30.976 --> 18:32.076
Yeah, yeah,
I feel great.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.244
It must be from
getting rid of all those --

18:33.279 --> 18:34.311
all those toxins.

18:34.346 --> 18:35.513
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, food truck's here.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.414
I'm gonna get a corn dog
and some fried cheese.

18:37.449 --> 18:38.415
Mmm.

18:38.450 --> 18:41.118
Ed, Ed, Ed.
Got a minute?

18:41.153 --> 18:43.454
Yeah, sure.

18:45.724 --> 18:48.325
Look, I was thinking about what
you said yesterday. Mm-hmm.

18:48.360 --> 18:50.661
Do you remember
what you said yesterday?

18:51.730 --> 18:53.597
Yes, I remember.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.366
There's only one thing
you can do

18:55.401 --> 18:58.302
when your best friend asks you
to fulfill his lifelong dream.

18:58.337 --> 19:00.104
Thank you, Mike.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.872
Get your own
damn spearhead.

19:01.907 --> 19:04.041
I can't do that.

19:04.076 --> 19:06.677
Remember last night, my big
speech about my cells dying?

19:06.712 --> 19:07.945
You're not dying.

19:07.980 --> 19:11.949
You're aging like everybody else
except John Stamos.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.618
My mistake was treating you
like a feeble old man.

19:14.653 --> 19:16.453
I never said I was feeble.

19:16.488 --> 19:18.889
Well, taking credit for somebody
else's accomplishments --

19:18.924 --> 19:20.191
pretty feeble.

19:20.226 --> 19:21.892
Is that
what this is about?

19:21.927 --> 19:23.327
Having your name on that spearhead...
- No.

19:23.362 --> 19:24.695
...is really
that important to you?

19:24.730 --> 19:26.363
Come on.
- This is about you.

19:26.398 --> 19:28.966
You're forgetting things.
That doesn't make you senile.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.634
Come on, now.
W-What do you want from me?

19:30.669 --> 19:31.835
Why did you call me
in here?

19:31.870 --> 19:34.038
I'd like you
to go with me to Brazil.

19:34.073 --> 19:37.374
They found caves
in Mount Allegra, unexplored.

19:37.409 --> 19:39.710
Get out of here.
Is that right?

19:39.745 --> 19:42.980
Maybe I can get to use all that
equipment that we sell, huh?

19:43.015 --> 19:44.348
It'd be good to get away.
That's right.

19:44.383 --> 19:46.417
Then I can spend time
in the cantina.

19:46.452 --> 19:47.718
What do you think?

19:49.221 --> 19:50.821
W-Why --
Why am I holding this?

19:50.856 --> 19:53.057
What's --
What's going on?

19:55.060 --> 19:57.261
Ed?

19:57.296 --> 19:59.363
Feeble old man got you,
huh?

19:59.398 --> 20:00.864
(laughs)

20:00.899 --> 20:03.201
We're going to Venezuela.

20:04.303 --> 20:05.769
Actually, Brazil.

20:05.804 --> 20:08.372
Ah,
we're going to Brazil!

20:15.281 --> 20:16.880
Mike Baxter here for Outdoor Man

20:16.915 --> 20:19.283
with some news I'm literally
dying to tell you.

20:19.318 --> 20:22.086
(sighs)
That's right.

20:22.121 --> 20:26.223
None of us is getting
out of this life alive.

20:26.258 --> 20:27.725
Have a nice day.

20:29.662 --> 20:31.295
Come on, wait.
Hear me out.

20:31.330 --> 20:33.797
It's not about
how many summers we have left.

20:33.832 --> 20:36.367
It's what we choose to do
with those summers.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.869
If you spend your life watching
"Walking Dead" marathons,

20:38.904 --> 20:40.537
you're no better than a zombie.

20:40.572 --> 20:42.039
Actually, you're<i> worse.</i>

20:42.074 --> 20:44.708
At least they're walking.

20:44.743 --> 20:46.744
You're sitting on your ass.

20:46.779 --> 20:49.213
The Bible teaches us
that we start out as dust,

20:49.248 --> 20:51.582
and unto dust we shall return.

20:51.617 --> 20:53.717
Don't be a dust bunny
in between.

20:53.752 --> 20:55.986
Climb a mountain,
ride some rapids --

20:56.021 --> 20:58.455
don't live life
like you're already dead.

20:58.490 --> 21:00.124
Because if God
can't tell the difference,

21:00.159 --> 21:05.162
he may just go ahead
and grab you early.

21:05.197 --> 21:07.231
So,
instead of crying about

21:07.266 --> 21:10.668
the number of grains of sand
left in your hourglass,

21:10.703 --> 21:12.169
do something to make sure

21:12.204 --> 21:14.605
there are as many in there
as possible.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.440
So get your insides
photographed.

21:16.475 --> 21:18.342
Heck, invite some friends,
play some cards.

21:18.377 --> 21:20.010
Let me tell you,
that's one poker game

21:20.045 --> 21:21.645
that nothing beats a flush.

21:21.680 --> 21:23.981
(laughs)

21:24.016 --> 21:28.052
