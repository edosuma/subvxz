that kids Michelle's age

10:27.043 --> 10:28.587
are going to test their limits.

You see, the amount

15:13.954 --> 15:17.458
- But, dad, she ran--

15:13.954 --> 15:17.458
- Steph, save your energy.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.252
You'll need it to rake.

15:19.293 --> 15:21.588
Daddy, I want

15:19.293 --> 15:21.588
to go swimming.

15:21.629 --> 15:23.464
No, Michelle.

15:21.629 --> 15:23.464
It's too cold outside.

15:23.506 --> 15:25.258
No swimming.

15:25.299 --> 15:28.177
But it's a beautiful day

15:25.299 --> 15:28.177
for raking leaves.

15:29.387 --> 15:31.765
Let's get this

15:29.387 --> 15:31.765
over with.

15:34.475 --> 15:36.603
Michelle,

15:34.475 --> 15:36.603
what are you doing?

15:36.644 --> 15:38.145
Going swimming.

15:38.187 --> 15:39.731
But dad said no.

15:39.773 --> 15:42.525
Well, I said yes.

15:42.567 --> 15:44.736
But it's too cold outside.

15:44.778 --> 15:47.822
That's why I'm swimming inside.

15:49.783 --> 15:51.785
Joey, why did we

15:49.783 --> 15:51.785
ever agree to do

15:51.826 --> 15:56.456
a commercial for

15:51.826 --> 15:56.456
the national liver council?

15:56.497 --> 15:58.999
- You guys, can I interrupt?

15:56.497 --> 15:58.999
- Please.

15:59.041 --> 16:02.420
Ah, Jess, honey. I had my ring

15:59.041 --> 16:02.420
appraised for insurance.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.672
I had no idea you spent

16:02.462 --> 16:04.672
so much money on it.

16:04.714 --> 16:07.007
Eh, don't worry

16:04.714 --> 16:07.007
about it, sweetheart.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.551
Well, I am worried because

16:07.049 --> 16:08.551
I know that you sold

16:08.593 --> 16:10.762
your Elvis guitar

16:08.593 --> 16:10.762
to help pay for it .

16:10.804 --> 16:12.388
Who told you I..

16:12.430 --> 16:13.848
Joseph?

16:13.890 --> 16:16.893
Well, it's not Joey's fault.

16:13.890 --> 16:16.893
I made him tell me.

16:16.935 --> 16:18.394
What did she do,

16:16.935 --> 16:18.394
twist your arm?

16:18.436 --> 16:20.939
No. She bent my thumb

16:18.436 --> 16:20.939
back like this.

16:23.190 --> 16:25.192
And it really hurt.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.653
Get out, liver boy.

16:26.694 --> 16:29.530
Okay, liverace.

16:29.572 --> 16:33.326
Look, Becky, the ring

16:29.572 --> 16:33.326
is paid for, case closed.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.035
Alright, fine,

16:33.367 --> 16:35.035
But it just so happens

16:35.077 --> 16:37.163
I bought you a present, too.

16:39.165 --> 16:41.125
Remember your

16:39.165 --> 16:41.125
favorite guitar?

16:41.167 --> 16:43.252
Oh, Becky,

16:41.167 --> 16:43.252
this-this is very sweet

16:43.294 --> 16:44.879
but I can't accept the guitar.

16:44.921 --> 16:47.632
I mean it would be like you

16:44.921 --> 16:47.632
chipping in for your own ring.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.634
- So what wrong with that?

16:47.674 --> 16:49.634
- Well, everything.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.385
Eh, it's a tradition

16:49.676 --> 16:51.385
we are talking here.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.680
Man buys woman ring.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.680
Woman wears ring.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.431
Man and woman live

16:53.721 --> 16:55.431
happily ever after.

16:55.473 --> 16:59.769
Nowhere in the story does it

16:55.473 --> 16:59.769
say, "woman buys guitar."

16:59.811 --> 17:02.188
How am I possibly

16:59.811 --> 17:02.188
supposed to respond

17:02.229 --> 17:05.775
to that kind of twisted

17:02.229 --> 17:05.775
Neanderthal logic?

17:05.817 --> 17:08.110
Very simple. By saying,

17:05.817 --> 17:08.110
"Jesse, you're right.

17:08.152 --> 17:11.990
You've always been right,

17:08.152 --> 17:11.990
and you'll always be right."

17:12.031 --> 17:13.491
Oh, I'll stitch

17:12.031 --> 17:13.491
a sampler of that

17:13.533 --> 17:15.451
and hang it, right over

17:13.533 --> 17:15.451
over the mantel.

17:15.493 --> 17:17.119
[clearing throat]

17:15.493 --> 17:17.119
Look, Jess.

17:17.161 --> 17:18.788
If you don't

17:17.161 --> 17:18.788
accept the guitar

17:18.830 --> 17:20.122
then I'm afraid I can't

17:18.830 --> 17:20.122
accept the ring.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.791
- Becky.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.791
- Now, Jesse, look.

17:21.833 --> 17:24.544
You don't have to be this

17:21.833 --> 17:24.544
tough, macho guy with me.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.295
We're a team now

17:26.337 --> 17:28.589
and I would like it

17:26.337 --> 17:28.589
if our marriage

17:28.631 --> 17:30.508
was an equal partnership.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.969
So let me be

17:30.550 --> 17:32.969
as generous to you

17:33.011 --> 17:35.346
as you are to me.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.264
Beck, listen,

17:35.388 --> 17:37.264
it makes sense to me

17:37.306 --> 17:39.934
but I just can't take

17:37.306 --> 17:39.934
the guitar back.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.394
It just doesn't feel right.

17:41.435 --> 17:43.396
Okay.

17:41.435 --> 17:43.396
How does this feel?

17:43.437 --> 17:45.773
- Ow, ow, ow, ow!

17:43.437 --> 17:45.773
- Take it back!

17:45.815 --> 17:46.941
Okay, alright,

17:45.815 --> 17:46.941
I'll take it back.

17:46.983 --> 17:48.943
I'll take it back.

17:48.985 --> 17:50.444
See, Jess?

17:50.486 --> 17:52.947
You were right.

17:50.486 --> 17:52.947
You've always been right.

17:52.989 --> 17:55.115
You always will be right.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.036
Right.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.747
Toot-toot.

18:00.788 --> 18:03.082
Toot-toot.

18:03.123 --> 18:04.542
Having fun, Michelle?

18:04.584 --> 18:07.420
Surf's up, dudes.

18:07.461 --> 18:09.005
"Surf's up, dudes?"

18:09.047 --> 18:11.049
No. Your time's up, dudette.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.216
I'm calling dad.

18:12.258 --> 18:14.635
Wait, is there

18:12.258 --> 18:14.635
any possible way

18:14.677 --> 18:16.512
we can get blamed

18:14.677 --> 18:16.512
for this?

18:16.554 --> 18:18.138
Not this time.

18:16.554 --> 18:18.138
Look at her.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.892
She's a sitting duck.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.685
We got her now.

18:22.727 --> 18:25.312
- Dad, get in here!

18:22.727 --> 18:25.312
- Hurry up!

18:25.354 --> 18:27.398
Girls, what's all the..

18:29.609 --> 18:31.694
No shoes in the pool.

18:33.071 --> 18:37.116
Girls, you better have

18:33.071 --> 18:37.116
an explanation for this.

18:37.157 --> 18:40.202
He's blaming us.

18:37.157 --> 18:40.202
This is a nightmare.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.080
Dad, It's not our fault.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.831
Michelle dragged in her pool.

18:43.873 --> 18:45.917
Michelle filled it

18:43.873 --> 18:45.917
with water.

18:45.959 --> 18:47.418
Michelle blew up

18:45.959 --> 18:47.418
her floaties

18:47.460 --> 18:50.630
and Michelle threw herself

18:47.460 --> 18:50.630
a pool party.

18:50.671 --> 18:53.257
Dad, the key word

18:50.671 --> 18:53.257
here is..

18:53.299 --> 18:55.885
...Michelle.

18:55.927 --> 18:57.136
Well, if you saw her

18:55.927 --> 18:57.136
do all those things

18:57.177 --> 18:58.930
why didn't you try

18:57.177 --> 18:58.930
and stop her?

18:58.972 --> 19:01.265
Because you let her do

18:58.972 --> 19:01.265
whatever she wants.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.434
- No, I don't.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.434
- Yes, you do.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.561
I'm a little princess.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.190
Uh-oh.

19:10.232 --> 19:11.901
This is all my fault.

19:11.943 --> 19:14.570
What? She's off

19:11.943 --> 19:14.570
the hook again?

19:14.612 --> 19:17.531
She is really good.

19:17.573 --> 19:19.617
She's not off the hook.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.577
Okay, little princess

19:21.619 --> 19:23.037
you and I need to talk.

19:23.079 --> 19:25.915
Am I in big trouble,

19:23.079 --> 19:25.915
mister?

19:27.041 --> 19:28.876
Yes, ma'am.

19:28.918 --> 19:30.795
Stand up, please.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.880
Girls, if you'll excuse us

19:30.837 --> 19:32.880
for a moment

19:32.922 --> 19:34.173
I need to talk

19:32.922 --> 19:34.173
to Michelle

19:34.214 --> 19:37.551
about her very

19:34.214 --> 19:37.551
first punishment.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.263
Nail her, dad.

19:41.305 --> 19:43.683
And if she tries to pulls

19:41.305 --> 19:43.683
any of that cute stuff

19:43.724 --> 19:46.978
think of your wet shoe.

19:47.020 --> 19:49.063
I'll remember that.

19:50.397 --> 19:51.941
[sighing]

19:51.983 --> 19:55.028
Michelle, you've had it

19:51.983 --> 19:55.028
pretty easy around here.

19:55.069 --> 19:58.364
I like it here.

19:58.405 --> 20:02.702
Well, things

19:58.405 --> 20:02.702
are about to change.

20:02.743 --> 20:04.078
The truth is

20:04.120 --> 20:06.497
Michelle, you're very,

20:04.120 --> 20:06.497
very special to me

20:06.539 --> 20:09.249
because you're

20:06.539 --> 20:09.249
my last little baby

20:09.291 --> 20:11.002
and I guess,

20:09.291 --> 20:11.002
in a way

20:11.044 --> 20:13.212
I wanted you

20:11.044 --> 20:13.212
to stay that way.

20:14.839 --> 20:17.050
But I got to face it.

20:17.091 --> 20:19.010
You're a big girl now.

20:19.052 --> 20:20.720
So if you do something wrong

20:20.761 --> 20:23.305
you're old enough

20:20.761 --> 20:23.305
to be punished.

20:23.347 --> 20:25.432
Is it over now?

20:25.474 --> 20:28.227
No. Listening to me talk

20:25.474 --> 20:28.227
is not punishment.

20:32.356 --> 20:34.942
Although it does seem to

20:32.356 --> 20:34.942
help you go to sleep.

20:34.984 --> 20:36.360
Honey, I just want

20:34.984 --> 20:36.360
you to know

20:36.402 --> 20:38.779
I'm only doing this

20:36.402 --> 20:38.779
because I love you.

20:38.821 --> 20:41.157
I love you, daddy.

20:42.783 --> 20:44.077
Ohh.

20:44.118 --> 20:45.786
Wait a minute.

20:45.828 --> 20:47.872
My shoe is wet.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.582
Okay.

20:49.623 --> 20:52.168
My shoe is wet.

20:52.210 --> 20:53.836
My shoe is wet.

20:53.878 --> 20:55.462
My shoe is wet.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.506
It's wet.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.506
I can feel it.

Are you ready to be

I'll be

a very good girl.

21:18.444 --> 21:19.737
Good.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.614
And did you learn a lesson

21:19.779 --> 21:21.614
from all this?

21:21.655 --> 21:26.160
Yes, I did. No swimming

Yes, No swimming

21:29.538 --> 21:31.582
but there's a bigger

21:29.538 --> 21:31.582
lesson here.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.333
Daddy, Uncle Jesse,

21:31.624 --> 21:33.333

21:33.375 --> 21:35.711

to do something

21:38.297 --> 21:40.091
you should do it.

21:40.133 --> 21:41.550
Deal?

21:41.592 --> 21:43.052
You're the boss.

21:43.094 --> 21:46.680
Okay, then,

21:43.094 --> 21:46.680
punishment is over.

No, it's not.

Time for bed.

21:51.144 --> 21:53.896
Can we watch Arsenio?

21:53.938 --> 21:54.939
What do you think?

21:54.981 --> 21:57.483
I think it's time for bed.

21:57.524 --> 21:59.944
You think right.

21:57.524 --> 21:59.944
It's time for bed.

21:59.986 --> 22:04.198
To bed, I said.
