02:32.760 --> 02:35.595
- $3 worth. That's all you want?
- Yeah.

02:35.596 --> 02:39.693
And if you're not too busy, you can
wipe the bugs off the windshield.

02:41.535 --> 02:43.664
Bob Santos.

02:45.206 --> 02:47.130
Ambrocio Verraras.

02:48.743 --> 02:50.838
Luis Ortegas.

02:55.049 --> 02:56.816
Have you picked melons before?

02:56.817 --> 02:59.018
Luis? All his life.

02:59.019 --> 03:03.253
- He was born in a melon field.
- Okay.

03:03.491 --> 03:05.725
Hey, Larry, what about me?

03:05.726 --> 03:07.252
Roberto.

03:07.561 --> 03:12.489
Vincent, we got 30. Do we
need any more than that?

03:13.601 --> 03:15.902
If he's got some who'll
work for nothing.

03:15.903 --> 03:19.795
Man, you're sure tight with the dollar.
You squeeze it to death.

03:19.940 --> 03:23.009
We're paying a $1.40
an hour, 10-hour day.

03:23.010 --> 03:24.878
And don't you shortchange me.

03:24.879 --> 03:28.771
Hey, man, I take my percent.
I don't need to cheat them.

03:29.049 --> 03:33.486
Larry's going along. If he finds anybody
hasn't slipped melons, they come back.

03:33.487 --> 03:35.321
And for them, I don't pay.

03:35.322 --> 03:37.690
Man, I never give you no bums.

03:37.691 --> 03:41.288
- All these people are experts.
- Yeah, I know.

03:52.673 --> 03:54.267
$3.

04:32.513 --> 04:36.983
$3. That's $4, and $5.

04:36.984 --> 04:39.284
Hurry back and see us.

04:39.520 --> 04:41.740
Is there a key you have
to the ladies' room?

04:41.741 --> 04:45.091
- It's broken. You can't use it.
- What about the men's room?

04:45.092 --> 04:47.393
It's broken, too.
Both of them are broken.

04:47.394 --> 04:50.597
We'll go in separately.
The men come out, I go in.

04:50.598 --> 04:53.166
You don't have to call the
cops and say we're doing it.

04:53.167 --> 04:56.236
I'll call them right now if you want
me to. Now get the hell out of here.

04:56.237 --> 04:58.304
- Where do you go?
- I'm warning you.

04:58.305 --> 05:00.840
Maybe you never go?
That's why you're so full of shit.

05:00.841 --> 05:02.230
Hey.

05:03.310 --> 05:06.543
I was the last one to
use that men's room.

05:06.547 --> 05:09.245
You saying I busted the toilet?

05:09.383 --> 05:11.851
Listen, you know how many
migrants stop in here?

05:11.852 --> 05:16.890
These people get in there, take a bath,
mess the place up, steal the toilet paper.

05:16.891 --> 05:18.849
Let them use it.

05:19.026 --> 05:21.060
I work for somebody. You understand?

05:21.061 --> 05:24.030
Now my boss says no
migrants use our restroom.

05:24.031 --> 05:26.422
Not even if they buy gas.

05:29.370 --> 05:31.499
You looking for work?

05:32.506 --> 05:36.576
Well, we forgot our golf
clubs, so we might as well.

05:36.577 --> 05:39.138
You know something about melons?

05:39.146 --> 05:42.413
Onions, lettuce, melons.
We pick anything you got.

05:46.120 --> 05:48.187
After you use the toilet.

05:48.188 --> 05:50.123
First things first.

05:50.124 --> 05:52.559
Since the toilets are broken...

05:52.560 --> 05:55.061
why don't you all come
in here and use this?

05:55.062 --> 05:57.797
Get out of here now.
Every goddamn one of you.

05:57.798 --> 05:59.933
You said somebody
else owned the place.

05:59.934 --> 06:03.462
What the hell do you care if
they use the toilet or not?

06:07.975 --> 06:11.003
Here. Don't take all day.

06:36.670 --> 06:39.372
Those people your relatives?

06:39.373 --> 06:41.035
Friends.

06:44.044 --> 06:46.844
You been traveling with them long?

06:47.848 --> 06:50.450
What are you trying to find out?

06:50.451 --> 06:53.547
If I sleep with some of them?

06:53.988 --> 06:55.377
Hell.

06:57.224 --> 06:58.992
We go to different places.

06:58.993 --> 07:01.995
We help organize the farm workers.

07:01.996 --> 07:04.956
We also have to stop and
work to pay our way.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.300
You work for the union?

07:09.536 --> 07:12.336
If I tell you yes, you don't hire us?

07:12.539 --> 07:16.875
I don't care if you work for the union,
you don't work for the union.

07:17.077 --> 07:19.377
As long as you know melons.

07:19.813 --> 07:22.841
Look, I've been in the
fields most of my life.

07:23.183 --> 07:25.818
- What's your name?
- Nancy Chavez.

07:25.819 --> 07:27.887
Not related to the other Chavez.

07:27.888 --> 07:29.455
But I'll tell you something.

07:29.456 --> 07:32.392
I was on the picket line with
them during the grape strike.

07:32.393 --> 07:34.351
I believe it.

07:34.928 --> 07:37.262
- Is that yours?
- Yes.

07:38.465 --> 07:40.696
160 acres.

07:40.868 --> 07:45.329
My second crop.
If I don't make it this time...

08:06.160 --> 08:08.561
This guy's already
got a crew working.

08:08.562 --> 08:11.522
What the hell are we
supposed to do, go home?

08:21.308 --> 08:23.609
Hey, I don't think I know you.

08:23.610 --> 08:25.409
Bobby Kopas.

08:25.446 --> 08:29.043
Come over from La Junta
with some top-hand pickers.

08:31.819 --> 08:34.914
I don't think I ever hired
you before, either.

08:35.089 --> 08:37.889
One thing I know
for sure, I never will.

08:38.025 --> 08:40.289
$1.20 an hour?

08:40.461 --> 08:44.024
Save yourself some money,
and they're already hard at it.

08:44.331 --> 08:48.030
I don't hire winos who never
slipped melons before.

08:48.869 --> 08:52.761
I don't know. You hire a lot
of Latins and no whites.

08:53.107 --> 08:55.141
Looks like discrimination to me.

08:55.142 --> 08:57.977
Get your people on the truck.
Get off my land.

08:57.978 --> 09:00.513
Them Latins buddies of yours?

09:00.514 --> 09:05.146
Look, what do you care who works for you,
as long as you get the job done, right?

09:05.319 --> 09:06.753
I hire who I want.

09:06.754 --> 09:09.486
Yeah, well, you see, you want me.

09:09.490 --> 09:13.951
Only it ain't sunk into that
thick brain of yours yet.

09:16.897 --> 09:18.898
See, everything goes a lot easier...

09:18.899 --> 09:22.359
and a lot less trouble when
you do business with me.

09:23.804 --> 09:26.832
You understand what
I'm talking about?

09:28.375 --> 09:32.302
You make sounds like you're
a mean little ass-kicker.

09:33.280 --> 09:35.580
Only I ain't convinced.

09:36.416 --> 09:39.512
You keep talking,
I'm gonna take your head off.

09:39.820 --> 09:41.209
Hey.

09:42.689 --> 09:46.388
Leave the melons you've picked
or messed up right there.

09:46.527 --> 09:49.361
Pile in the truck and
get out of here.

09:50.831 --> 09:54.667
I know you need the work,
and I know you want to work.

09:55.302 --> 09:57.727
I already hired a crew.

09:57.738 --> 09:59.765
The man made a mistake.

10:02.042 --> 10:04.569
You came to the wrong place.

10:20.093 --> 10:23.826
What're you gonna do now?
You gonna shoot us?

10:23.897 --> 10:27.300
Lady, I'm gonna talk to him,
and this time he's gonna listen.

10:27.301 --> 10:30.499
For $1.20 an hour,
you gonna shoot people?

10:30.938 --> 10:34.068
He threatened me,
and all you people heard it.

10:43.217 --> 10:46.347
Stay back, boy, I'm warning you.

10:47.554 --> 10:50.684
Mean little ass-kicker
like you, need a gun...

11:04.338 --> 11:06.205
Put him in the car.

11:07.441 --> 11:09.775
Like I said, the man made a mistake.

11:09.776 --> 11:11.939
Pile into the truck.

11:22.723 --> 11:24.715
Open up the trunk.

11:37.070 --> 11:38.459
Open it.

11:52.619 --> 11:54.145
Hey, buddy.

11:55.422 --> 11:58.655
You want my opinion,
you're in the wrong business.

12:24.318 --> 12:25.651
- Majestyk?
- Yeah.

12:25.652 --> 12:29.155
Someone lodged a complaint against
you. I got a warrant for your arrest.

12:29.156 --> 12:31.751
Can you put your hands on the truck?

12:32.859 --> 12:34.988
- Is this yours?
- Yeah.

12:46.306 --> 12:48.333
Okay, let's go.

13:01.755 --> 13:04.715
What's happened? Hey!

13:48.668 --> 13:51.570
If you can't afford to hire a
lawyer one will be appointed...

13:51.571 --> 13:54.407
to represent you before any
questioning, if you wish.

13:54.408 --> 13:57.076
Do you understand these
rights I've explained to you?

13:57.077 --> 13:59.308
If you do, write "yes" here.

13:59.880 --> 14:03.015
Having these rights in mind,
do you wish to talk to us now?

14:03.016 --> 14:05.907
If you do, you write "yes" here.

14:06.253 --> 14:09.622
Sign your name, address,
city and state.

14:21.435 --> 14:24.429
- Witness it, Richie.
- Yes, sir.

14:32.412 --> 14:35.474
My name is McAllen,
Detective Lieutenant.

14:35.882 --> 14:38.750
You understand your
rights under the law?

14:38.852 --> 14:43.052
I understand I should keep my mouth shut.
That seems to be about it.

14:43.390 --> 14:46.258
You can tell your side
of it if you want.

14:47.427 --> 14:52.161
Well, a man I never saw before tried
to force me to use a crew I didn't want.

14:52.299 --> 14:55.568
Complainant says he offered
you a business proposition.

14:55.569 --> 14:59.928
And instead of a simple "no thanks,"
you assaulted him with a shotgun.

15:00.540 --> 15:02.708
It was his gun, not mine.

15:02.709 --> 15:05.100
And he was trespassing.

15:05.245 --> 15:06.771
Lieutenant.

15:07.180 --> 15:11.417
Four years ago, he got one-to-five
in California for assault. First offense.

15:11.418 --> 15:14.120
Served nine months in Folsom.

15:14.121 --> 15:17.354
You use a gun that time
in California, too?

15:18.992 --> 15:20.984
It was in a bar.

15:21.094 --> 15:23.428
Guy hit me with a beer bottle.

15:23.430 --> 15:25.491
Hey, Lieutenant.

15:25.565 --> 15:29.924
Lieutenant, I got 160 acres
of melons sitting out there.

15:29.936 --> 15:31.637
I got to get them in.

15:31.638 --> 15:34.073
Let me go see that they're picked...

15:34.074 --> 15:36.609
and I'll come back a
few days later, okay?

15:36.610 --> 15:40.275
If this was your first offense,
how come they put you away?

15:46.353 --> 15:50.055
See, this guy came to trial with a
broken collarbone and a wired jaw...

15:50.056 --> 15:53.983
and some friends of his who
testified that I started it.

15:53.994 --> 15:57.696
And they said that I kicked his
face in when he was unconscious.

15:57.697 --> 16:00.292
Of course, you did no such thing?

16:00.367 --> 16:03.463
I've been tried for it already, okay?

16:07.207 --> 16:09.097
You married?

16:09.509 --> 16:12.978
I was married for four years. My wife
divorced me when I was in prison.

16:12.979 --> 16:16.974
If I don't get those melons in
this week, I lose the whole crop.

16:17.284 --> 16:20.186
Hey, Lieutenant,
I only need a few days.

16:20.187 --> 16:22.922
That's all that's
worrying you? Melons?

16:22.923 --> 16:25.348
I think you better get a lawyer.

16:25.492 --> 16:28.427
He'll go to court. Court'll set bond.

16:28.428 --> 16:31.230
If you pay it, you can go
pick all the melons you want.

16:31.231 --> 16:35.301
Sure. I pay the bail, and I
have no money left for a crew.

16:35.302 --> 16:38.330
And I can't pick 160 acres by myself.

16:38.572 --> 16:41.106
You should have
thought of that earlier.

16:41.107 --> 16:42.997
Lock him up.

16:43.510 --> 16:44.899
Okay.

17:04.998 --> 17:07.888
Hey, buddy, you going
to eat that sausage?

17:16.276 --> 17:19.304
You ain't gonna eat it, nobody is?

17:19.779 --> 17:21.806
Help yourself.

17:22.715 --> 17:24.708
No, I guess not.

17:26.786 --> 17:29.381
Take one of those cigarettes though.

17:30.824 --> 17:33.192
- I'll pay you back later.
- Hey.

17:33.960 --> 17:35.294
Want a smoke?

17:35.295 --> 17:38.095
Yeah. It's all right. I got one.

17:41.768 --> 17:44.500
Hey, don't you know who that is?

17:50.443 --> 17:52.111
He's a TV star.

17:52.112 --> 17:53.846
Man, that's Frank Renda.

17:53.847 --> 17:56.977
Yeah, I saw him play
the accordion on TV.

17:57.484 --> 17:59.511
I said, Frank Renda.

17:59.686 --> 18:01.610
He's a hit man.

18:01.721 --> 18:04.112
You know what I'm saying?

18:04.257 --> 18:06.659
He shoots people with a gun.

18:06.660 --> 18:09.961
And you ask him is he
gonna eat his sausage.

18:20.473 --> 18:22.238
Cuff Renda.

18:23.677 --> 18:25.840
All right, let's go.

18:38.358 --> 18:40.526
Today, Frank Renda is being taken...

18:40.527 --> 18:44.763
to the county seat for pretrial examination
on a charge of first-degree murder.

18:44.764 --> 18:47.199
Renda, a familiar name
in organized crime...

18:47.200 --> 18:50.035
has been arrested nine
times without a conviction.

18:50.036 --> 18:52.805
This time, apprehended by
an off-duty police officer...

18:52.806 --> 18:55.674
who actually witnessed the
murder outside a local bar.

18:55.675 --> 18:58.243
It would appear Renda's
luck has finally run out.

18:58.244 --> 19:00.746
Hey, hey, come on.

19:00.747 --> 19:02.915
What the hell?

19:02.916 --> 19:07.286
This is Ron Malone with On The Spot
News coming to you from Edna, Colorado.

19:07.287 --> 19:09.211
Now he's a TV star.

21:26.259 --> 21:28.524
The keys for the handcuffs!

21:28.661 --> 21:31.029
The keys! Move!

21:31.364 --> 21:33.561
Just see if he's got them.

21:42.141 --> 21:44.634
Hey, he's hurt pretty bad.

21:44.777 --> 21:47.646
If we don't get him out of here,
he's gonna bleed to death.

21:47.647 --> 21:48.747
The keys.

21:48.748 --> 21:51.984
Man, I was drunk driving.
I don't want to get shot for that.

21:51.985 --> 21:53.784
The keys.

21:53.953 --> 21:55.621
Hey, out there!

21:55.622 --> 21:58.149
We got a wounded man here.

21:58.291 --> 22:01.059
Hold your fire, we'll bring him out.

22:01.060 --> 22:02.688
The keys.

22:02.862 --> 22:04.524
Go ahead.

22:10.770 --> 22:13.434
The keys.

22:14.240 --> 22:16.631
Don't shoot.

22:19.946 --> 22:22.211
Take him out, okay?

22:24.450 --> 22:26.943
What are you doing, you?

22:30.290 --> 22:33.056
Man, I hope you know
what you're doing.

22:38.898 --> 22:41.027
What are you doing?

22:52.712 --> 22:55.342
Get the bus with Renda. That way.

23:11.831 --> 23:14.722
Let's get the hell out of here.

23:14.901 --> 23:17.701
The panel truck. Get the truck.

24:38.951 --> 24:41.785
Hey, you move, you.

24:42.922 --> 24:46.849
I had you figured for the local
clown, but you really move.

24:48.961 --> 24:52.387
Hey, what'd they bust you for?

24:53.332 --> 24:55.359
Assault with a shotgun.

24:55.601 --> 24:57.434
A shotgun?

24:57.437 --> 24:59.538
That's attempted murder, man.

24:59.539 --> 25:01.573
They're gonna jam you the same as me.

25:01.574 --> 25:03.908
I got an idea that might work.

25:04.210 --> 25:06.635
You don't worry about it.

25:06.679 --> 25:11.049
I give you a phone number to call, we'll
be out of the country before morning.

25:11.050 --> 25:13.118
I like my idea better.

25:13.119 --> 25:16.454
Now listen, you come with me...

25:16.522 --> 25:18.389
be worth plenty.

25:21.194 --> 25:22.959
Sound good?

25:22.962 --> 25:26.665
You got it ass backwards. I ain't
coming with you, you're coming with me.

25:26.666 --> 25:29.796
Wait a minute. Talk to me.
Wait a minute.

25:36.909 --> 25:39.834
All right, listen, listen a minute.

26:15.982 --> 26:18.009
Well, we're home.

26:18.518 --> 26:20.152
This is your home?

26:20.153 --> 26:23.021
It's a place I use
during hunting season.

26:34.333 --> 26:36.701
You did take those keys.

27:11.637 --> 27:14.072
Come on, what is this game?

27:14.073 --> 27:16.441
In time, you'll find out.

27:18.110 --> 27:22.037
You know, we could be in LA tonight.

27:22.615 --> 27:24.683
Get in a couple of broads.

27:24.684 --> 27:27.109
Go to Mexico City in a few days.

27:27.954 --> 27:31.187
Cruise around, get a boat,
anything you want!

27:31.657 --> 27:34.548
I've been to LA,
and I've been to Mexico.

27:34.560 --> 27:36.689
And I've been laid.

27:37.363 --> 27:40.891
- Well, what do you want?
- I want to get a melon crop in.

27:42.401 --> 27:44.792
Hire somebody to do that.

27:46.572 --> 27:49.463
I intend to, but I got to be there.

27:51.244 --> 27:53.874
Okay. All right.

27:54.380 --> 27:56.348
Now I'm gonna tell you something.

27:56.349 --> 27:58.944
I've killed seven times with a gun.

27:59.385 --> 28:01.685
One guy I hit with a crowbar.

28:01.787 --> 28:04.178
Another guy I threw off a roof.

28:04.290 --> 28:06.958
Some others I didn't kill
myself, but I had it done...

28:06.959 --> 28:11.056
like I can have it done for you,
if you don't make a deal with me.

28:13.266 --> 28:14.866
What kind of deal?

28:14.867 --> 28:16.434
You name the price.

28:16.435 --> 28:20.293
Just get me out of these,
and I'll walk out of here. How much?

28:22.108 --> 28:23.842
You don't know.

28:23.843 --> 28:27.406
What's the matter, you afraid
your price will be too low?

28:27.713 --> 28:30.115
All right, I'll tell you how much.

28:30.116 --> 28:31.881
Twenty-five.

28:32.718 --> 28:34.052
Twenty-five what?

28:34.053 --> 28:36.353
$25,000.

28:41.827 --> 28:43.895
How do you manage that?

28:43.896 --> 28:46.131
I mean, how would you
get the money to me?

28:46.132 --> 28:50.869
You call a number I'll give you in Denver.
You say you've got a message for Wiley.

28:50.870 --> 28:54.501
The money will be delivered to
you any time, any place you say.

28:58.744 --> 29:01.271
$25,000.

29:06.118 --> 29:08.918
What did you say that
number in Denver is?

29:12.858 --> 29:14.850
Yeah. Okay.

29:41.854 --> 29:44.255
Hi. How are you?

29:44.256 --> 29:46.391
Okay. This is a nice place.

29:46.392 --> 29:48.419
Yeah, we like it.

29:48.594 --> 29:52.497
I was driving on the road, got a flat
tire, and I found I didn't have a spare.

29:52.498 --> 29:53.932
That's a shame.

29:53.933 --> 29:55.834
Yeah, a long walk to get here, too.

29:55.835 --> 29:58.370
I was wondering if you
have a phone I could use.

29:58.371 --> 30:00.805
Yes, we have a phone you can use.

30:00.806 --> 30:02.607
How much to call Edna?

30:02.608 --> 30:05.943
Edna? Two bits.

30:07.380 --> 30:08.747
Two bits.

30:08.748 --> 30:11.844
Didn't have a spare,
and I don't have two bits.

30:12.918 --> 30:14.119
Well...

30:14.120 --> 30:17.422
I think I can trust you for a
phone call. Phone's over there.

30:17.423 --> 30:19.620
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

30:28.100 --> 30:29.200
Operator.

30:29.201 --> 30:32.404
Operator, would you get me the
police department in Edna, please?

30:32.405 --> 30:36.400
This is 456-9253.

30:37.276 --> 30:40.474
- Edna Police Station.
- Lieutenant McAllen.

30:44.750 --> 30:48.286
- Hello.
- Hey, Lieutenant. This is Majestyk.

30:48.287 --> 30:50.188
Damn it, Majestyk, where are you?

30:50.189 --> 30:52.657
I'm downtown in a hotel,
what do you think?

30:52.658 --> 30:56.357
Get your ass over here,
or you'll be in a lot more trouble...

30:56.529 --> 30:57.896
Listen...

30:57.897 --> 31:01.960
Listen to me now, who the hell
do you think's paying for this call?

31:02.001 --> 31:04.801
- What's on your mind?
- Now that's better.

31:05.004 --> 31:06.704
Hey, Lieutenant, I got Renda.

31:06.705 --> 31:08.273
What? I don't believe you.

31:08.274 --> 31:11.910
I said I got him. He can't get
loose, unless I turn him loose.

31:11.911 --> 31:15.405
Just think again. He's got
you all over the country...

31:17.349 --> 31:20.018
You keep talking, man,
I'm gonna hang up.

31:20.019 --> 31:21.686
Vince, what do you want?

31:21.687 --> 31:24.612
All right. I got Frank Renda...

31:25.124 --> 31:27.992
and you got an assault
charge against me.

31:27.993 --> 31:31.129
Drop the charge, I'll give you Renda.

31:31.130 --> 31:32.797
You're gonna sell him to us?

31:32.798 --> 31:35.533
Well, there ain't nothing
that's free in this world.

31:35.534 --> 31:37.969
Why don't we come
right over and get him?

31:37.970 --> 31:40.235
No, I'll deliver him.

31:40.372 --> 31:42.307
- Right, then.
- You come here...

31:42.308 --> 31:44.342
you're liable to say you found us.

31:44.343 --> 31:47.145
You're taking a risk.
I think we'd better come there.

31:47.146 --> 31:50.344
- Yeah...
- Tell me where you are, I'll be there...

31:54.787 --> 31:56.279
Miss?

31:56.755 --> 31:57.822
Yes.

31:57.823 --> 32:00.919
Could you trust me for
one more call to Denver?

32:01.127 --> 32:02.892
Sure, okay.

32:04.096 --> 32:07.397
And a couple of bottles
of beer to go, okay?

32:08.067 --> 32:09.559
All right.

32:25.751 --> 32:27.641
- Yeah?
- Hey...

32:27.653 --> 32:29.921
I got a message for
someone named Wiley.

32:29.922 --> 32:32.857
Wiley's not here now. You can
leave the message with me.

32:32.858 --> 32:34.225
All right.

32:34.226 --> 32:37.652
Get a pencil and paper,
and I'll give you the details.

32:51.310 --> 32:52.768
That's it.

32:56.482 --> 32:58.372
That's the car, man!

33:00.753 --> 33:02.450
Okay, let's go.

33:34.320 --> 33:35.846
Who's that?

33:36.222 --> 33:37.689
That's Wiley.

33:37.690 --> 33:39.887
That's all you got to know.

33:39.959 --> 33:42.725
- God, Frank, you're really a mess!
- Yeah.

33:42.728 --> 33:45.597
- Where's the money?
- I already gave it to her.

33:45.598 --> 33:49.058
- Gave it to who?
- The lady at the store on the highway.

33:49.301 --> 33:52.693
I was told to stop there
and give her $3.85.

33:52.705 --> 33:54.504
That's what I did.

33:55.941 --> 33:58.241
$3.85?

33:59.111 --> 34:01.502
Hey, what are you pulling, man?

34:01.947 --> 34:04.508
We made a deal, $25,000.

34:04.516 --> 34:06.008
You drive.

34:06.485 --> 34:09.045
You sit on the other side up front.

34:09.822 --> 34:11.688
Hey, wait a minute.

34:11.924 --> 34:15.885
You want to do it by yourself,
or you want me to give you some help?

34:28.940 --> 34:32.275
I must have missed something.
Where are we going?

34:32.277 --> 34:34.168
We're going to jail.

34:34.280 --> 34:35.840
What?

34:37.181 --> 34:38.810
You fink!

34:47.126 --> 34:48.514
Okay...

34:49.828 --> 34:51.596
you got a new game.

34:51.597 --> 34:54.362
The price is up.
What's it gonna cost?

34:55.034 --> 34:57.302
You paid $3.85, you're in.

34:57.303 --> 34:59.295
Stop the bullshit!

35:00.239 --> 35:01.663
How much?

35:02.875 --> 35:04.572
Nothing, Frank.

35:06.912 --> 35:09.678
I explained it to
you simply, didn't I?

35:09.815 --> 35:13.548
You make a deal with me,
or you're dead. You understand?

35:14.186 --> 35:16.213
I go away, you're dead!

35:16.822 --> 35:18.712
I made another deal.

35:20.292 --> 35:22.159
With who, the cops?

35:22.861 --> 35:25.559
They'll have to live
with you forever.

35:26.131 --> 35:27.896
Can you see that?

35:28.267 --> 35:31.067
Never knowing when
you're gonna get hit.

35:33.105 --> 35:35.405
He's kind of weird, isn't he?

35:36.108 --> 35:38.203
Baby, you want a cigarette?

35:38.410 --> 35:40.107
- Yeah.
- Here.

36:49.681 --> 36:51.548
Lieutenant McAllen.

36:53.786 --> 36:55.915
Well, Majestyk!

36:56.288 --> 36:58.553
- I had him.
- Did you?

36:58.924 --> 37:01.159
I suppose you want to
hear what happened.

37:01.160 --> 37:03.050
I think I can guess.

37:03.662 --> 37:06.690
- Take him away, Mark.
- You don't want to hear?

38:06.959 --> 38:08.326
Hey!

38:08.327 --> 38:10.194
Frank, you like it?

38:12.731 --> 38:15.258
Sure is nice to have friends.

38:15.534 --> 38:17.068
- It's great.
- You like it?

38:17.069 --> 38:18.169
Yeah.

38:18.170 --> 38:22.073
The place has got air conditioning.
You got plenty of vodka, scotch...

38:22.074 --> 38:24.108
steaks in the icebox, here.

38:24.109 --> 38:27.672
And $2,500 for cigarette money.

38:28.380 --> 38:31.782
Frank, there's a really funny shower.
It's over the toilet.

38:31.783 --> 38:33.784
Tomorrow night you'll be in Mazatlán.

38:33.785 --> 38:36.320
Your house is all set.
It's on the beach.

38:36.321 --> 38:38.222
Everything's all ready.

38:38.223 --> 38:40.825
- A regular vacation.
- Yep.

38:40.826 --> 38:42.853
You having a good time?

38:43.195 --> 38:45.028
I could use a rest.

38:45.931 --> 38:47.965
That stunt hitting that bus...

38:47.966 --> 38:49.901
took a couple of years off me, man.

38:49.902 --> 38:51.969
- Where is he?
- Got a couple of beers?

38:51.970 --> 38:54.005
- Where is he?
- Want a beer?

38:54.006 --> 38:56.636
- Where is he?
- He turned himself in.

38:57.242 --> 38:59.443
They're holding him
in Edna, last I heard.

38:59.444 --> 39:01.420
A tight fit, but all
the comforts of home.

39:01.421 --> 39:04.263
We're not home, my love. He is.

39:04.264 --> 39:07.852
Frank. He's in jail. You're free.

39:07.853 --> 39:11.989
- We can go anywhere you want.
- There's only one thing I want.

39:11.990 --> 39:15.593
So he gets out of jail, you have him
killed. Same difference. Dude's dead.

39:15.594 --> 39:18.129
I said I want him, you understand?

39:18.130 --> 39:22.300
I want to look him in the face...
hold a piece against his gut...

39:22.301 --> 39:27.227
and when I know that he's
sure... I'm gonna kill him.

39:31.944 --> 39:33.511
Can I ask you a question?

39:33.512 --> 39:36.881
Are you going to walk in and ask
the cops for a visitor's pass?

39:36.882 --> 39:38.683
How will you get close to the dude?

39:38.684 --> 39:40.915
You find that sucker he hit.

39:40.953 --> 39:44.288
Tell him to drop the complaint,
it was all a mistake.

39:44.289 --> 39:48.352
- Suppose he doesn't want to do that?
- I said tell him, not ask him!

39:48.427 --> 39:50.561
Then we get a couple of our people.

39:50.562 --> 39:53.157
You find him, you call me...

39:53.599 --> 39:55.232
I come up...

39:55.233 --> 39:58.169
I'll have a talk with him,
and it's done.

39:58.170 --> 40:02.973
Frank, there's a dozen guys who'd do it,
guys who the cops aren't waiting to bust.

40:03.942 --> 40:06.071
I said I want him!

40:07.145 --> 40:08.534
Me!

40:09.314 --> 40:12.450
Hey, I never killed anybody
for free before, see?

40:12.451 --> 40:15.820
But this one, I'm doing as
a special favor to myself!

40:16.188 --> 40:20.080
And that's before I go to
Mazatlán, or lie on any beach.

40:22.160 --> 40:24.391
Am I getting through to you?

40:31.236 --> 40:33.904
- You got anything more on Majestyk?
- No, not much.

40:33.905 --> 40:37.441
High school education,
truck driver, farm laborer.

40:37.442 --> 40:39.310
He was in the army three years.

40:39.311 --> 40:41.712
A Ranger instructor at Fort Benning.

40:41.713 --> 40:43.714
Was captured in Vietnam...

40:43.715 --> 40:46.250
escaped with four enemy prisoners.

40:46.251 --> 40:48.050
Got a Silver Star.

40:48.820 --> 40:50.821
Man doesn't fool, does he?

40:50.822 --> 40:53.588
I don't know. Let's find out.

40:55.794 --> 40:57.320
Okay, Ben.

40:59.297 --> 41:00.857
Have a seat.

41:02.200 --> 41:04.625
I've been sitting for four days.

41:05.704 --> 41:08.197
I guess another day won't matter.

41:09.174 --> 41:11.166
When do I go to trial?

41:11.209 --> 41:13.907
The guy you hit, Bobby Kopas...

41:14.246 --> 41:16.273
dropped the charges.

41:19.251 --> 41:20.640
Well...

41:23.422 --> 41:25.690
- Why'd he do that?
- Said he thought it over.

41:25.691 --> 41:29.219
Wasn't important enough to
waste a lot of time in court.

41:29.461 --> 41:31.692
You think that's the reason?

41:32.197 --> 41:35.299
Lieutenant, whatever the reason,
it's all right with me...

41:35.300 --> 41:36.967
as long as I get back to my place.

41:36.968 --> 41:39.268
Maybe you'd better stay here.

41:40.739 --> 41:43.407
Now why would I do a
dumb thing like that?

41:43.408 --> 41:45.943
Because Frank Renda's
still walking around free.

41:45.944 --> 41:47.011
Yeah, I know.

41:47.012 --> 41:50.614
The eyeball witness who saw Renda
commit murder was a police officer.

41:50.615 --> 41:52.850
He was killed when Renda escaped.

41:52.851 --> 41:55.014
No witness, no case.

41:55.087 --> 41:58.055
You've given Renda a real good
reason to want to kill you.

41:58.056 --> 42:01.914
And I can't think of anything
that would stop him from trying.

42:02.894 --> 42:04.921
So you want me as bait.

42:05.831 --> 42:09.734
You don't let me go unless I hang
around and let him take a whack at me?

42:09.735 --> 42:11.659
Something like that.

42:16.241 --> 42:20.577
Why is it that I get a feeling from
you that you hope he pulls it off...

42:21.346 --> 42:23.481
just so you can nail him for murder.

42:23.482 --> 42:25.611
That did enter my mind...

42:25.884 --> 42:28.411
but we'll settle for attempted.

42:29.354 --> 42:31.155
As I remember it...

42:31.156 --> 42:33.624
you're the one who wanted
to make the deal...

42:33.625 --> 42:36.493
so you could go home
and pick your melons.

42:36.728 --> 42:39.392
All right, go pick them.

42:55.547 --> 42:58.142
- How did you sleep?
- Too long.

42:58.316 --> 43:00.581
Man, you needed it.

43:08.426 --> 43:10.861
I tried again this morning,
it's the same thing.

43:10.862 --> 43:12.863
Nobody wants to work for us.

43:12.864 --> 43:16.333
I talked to Julio, Tomas,
some of the others. What's going on?

43:16.334 --> 43:19.904
Julio says, "Man, I don't have
a crew for you, that's all."

43:19.905 --> 43:22.973
- Julio can get as many men as he wants.
- I know it.

43:22.974 --> 43:25.842
He sends them away,
says they are no good.

43:26.344 --> 43:28.245
That girl, Nancy Chavez...

43:28.246 --> 43:30.648
if she wasn't here,
we wouldn't have nobody.

43:30.649 --> 43:33.017
She got more of her
friends to work for us.

43:33.018 --> 43:36.546
But we've got to get a crew,
or we'll never get it done.

43:37.289 --> 43:40.249
I even have my wife
and the children working.

43:43.328 --> 43:44.717
Well...

43:45.297 --> 43:48.063
I hope you have better luck than me.

44:22.067 --> 44:23.400
7-8 to base.

44:23.401 --> 44:25.703
He just drove out in
his truck, heading west.

44:25.704 --> 44:27.196
I got him.

45:06.177 --> 45:07.478
Julio.

45:07.479 --> 45:09.513
Hey, Vince, they let you out, man!

45:09.514 --> 45:12.382
- That's great.
- I've been looking for you.

45:12.784 --> 45:14.652
Why can't you get me a crew?

45:14.653 --> 45:16.487
Hell, man, you've been in jail.

45:16.488 --> 45:20.391
Mendoza hasn't. He told me you turned
him down the last two mornings.

45:20.392 --> 45:22.660
It's the time of the year, Vince.

45:22.661 --> 45:25.529
I've got too much business.
Other people ask first.

45:25.530 --> 45:29.233
I'm asking you now for tomorrow morning.
Twenty people. $1.40 an hour.

45:29.234 --> 45:32.728
Vince, I got crews signed
for more than a week.

45:32.771 --> 45:35.571
You're just too late,
amigo, that's all.

45:36.341 --> 45:39.039
What about you?
Will you give me a crew?

45:40.979 --> 45:42.744
Maybe in 10 days.

45:42.981 --> 45:45.679
I can't promise you
nothing right now.

45:47.319 --> 45:48.852
What the hell is this?

45:48.853 --> 45:51.722
A stickup? What do you
want, a bonus? What?

45:51.723 --> 45:53.852
Vince, it's not the money.

45:53.858 --> 45:56.988
How can we get you people
if we don't have any?

45:59.597 --> 46:01.294
Hey, Julio...

46:01.566 --> 46:03.991
what the hell is the problem?

46:04.069 --> 46:06.369
Vince, will you listen to me?

46:06.538 --> 46:08.405
I got to work for a living.

46:08.406 --> 46:12.207
I can't do it from no damn
hospital, you understand?

46:17.282 --> 46:19.547
Okay. This I understand.

46:19.784 --> 46:21.085
Okay.

46:21.086 --> 46:22.748
Vince...

46:23.088 --> 46:25.217
Next season, okay, amigo?

46:29.461 --> 46:31.385
If he's still around.

46:42.874 --> 46:47.111
Hey, I hear you're looking for a crew.
Maybe I could get you some winos.

46:47.112 --> 46:49.546
Maybe I can fix it so
you'll never smile again.

46:49.547 --> 46:52.313
Touch me, you'll be back
in jail before noon.

47:03.661 --> 47:06.030
Hey, why did you drop the complaint?

47:06.031 --> 47:08.098
I'm being a good neighbor.

47:08.099 --> 47:10.734
And you think I'm pulling something?

47:10.735 --> 47:13.069
Now, why would you think that?

47:14.372 --> 47:16.399
Seeing me lose my crop?

47:17.142 --> 47:19.176
You know, I think you're mixed up.

47:19.177 --> 47:21.511
Standing there in deep shit...

47:22.580 --> 47:25.881
and all you're worried
about is your melon crop.

47:27.452 --> 47:30.116
You've been talking to somebody?

47:31.990 --> 47:35.125
- Yeah, who you got in mind?
- He get you to drop the complaint?

47:35.126 --> 47:37.094
I'm tired of talking to you.

47:37.095 --> 47:39.326
But I'll tell you one thing.

47:39.964 --> 47:44.232
Somebody's gonna set your ass on fire,
and I'm gonna be there to watch.

47:50.608 --> 47:53.738
Real nice, bigmouth. Real nice.

47:54.846 --> 47:56.838
I had to give him one.

47:57.415 --> 47:59.282
The son of a bitch.

48:45.697 --> 48:48.156
Hey, Frank. Smooth flight?

48:50.635 --> 48:52.024
Yeah.

48:52.036 --> 48:53.570
- Rough?
- How are you doing?

48:53.571 --> 48:56.371
Okay. Hey, Wiley, how're you doing?

49:00.712 --> 49:02.579
Your lawyer had to put up a bond...

49:02.580 --> 49:05.682
you gotta appear at a hearing,
but nothing to nail you with.

49:05.683 --> 49:06.884
- God!
- See?

49:06.885 --> 49:08.719
Nothing like a little dumb luck.

49:08.720 --> 49:10.654
What do you mean, "luck"?

49:10.655 --> 49:14.354
The secret is, never run until
you know you're being chased.

49:14.492 --> 49:17.528
- And have a fast lawyer available all times.
- Real fast.

49:17.529 --> 49:20.330
Your lawyer's waiting at the
lodge he rented for you.

49:20.331 --> 49:22.766
- Hey.
- He wants to talk to you.

49:22.767 --> 49:24.601
What about my melon picker?

49:24.602 --> 49:28.639
They turned him loose. The question now
is, what do the cops have in their minds?

49:28.640 --> 49:31.338
No, the question is, what's he doing?

49:31.876 --> 49:33.610
He's around. We just saw him.

49:33.611 --> 49:35.679
Probably at home waiting on you.

49:35.680 --> 49:38.326
Mr. Renda... I was wondering if,

49:38.327 --> 49:42.470
when you finish him off, you'd let
me put a couple of slugs in him?

49:44.088 --> 49:45.722
Who's this asshole?

49:45.723 --> 49:49.354
This is our friend Bobby Kopas,
the fellow Majestyk hit.

49:49.460 --> 49:53.964
He's making sure nobody works for him,
so there won't be a crowd around there.

49:53.965 --> 49:55.102
You know him good?

49:55.103 --> 49:58.165
Well, I know he's a
stuck-up son of a bitch.

49:58.169 --> 50:01.265
Got a few melons and
thinks he's a big grower.

50:01.306 --> 50:03.407
How long has he lived here?

50:03.408 --> 50:05.070
Too long.

50:06.911 --> 50:10.678
It seems that I ask you questions,
and you don't answer them.

50:10.748 --> 50:12.549
I'll try you again.

50:12.550 --> 50:15.552
- Would you show me where he lives?
- Yes, sir, any time.

50:15.553 --> 50:17.477
- Right now?
- You bet.

50:34.205 --> 50:36.539
We're up to it now, Mr. Renda.

50:37.375 --> 50:38.764
Sir.

50:41.579 --> 50:44.915
- You said no one was working for him.
- No crews.

50:44.916 --> 50:47.716
Just some migrants
he hired, that's all.

51:04.902 --> 51:07.099
Go up a ways, and turn around.

51:20.718 --> 51:22.286
How long's that been here?

51:22.287 --> 51:24.788
They're always patching the
road, getting in the way.

51:24.789 --> 51:26.256
How long?

51:26.257 --> 51:29.387
I don't know. Two or
three days, sir, I think.

51:39.904 --> 51:42.539
Don't you know cops
when you see them?

51:42.540 --> 51:45.101
Cops? Are you sure?

51:45.343 --> 51:48.143
I never thought about
cops being around.

51:51.482 --> 51:53.917
They'll get tired in a
couple of days and leave.

51:53.918 --> 51:57.654
Then we can run those Mexicans off.
Wouldn't be no sweat to that.

51:57.655 --> 51:59.147
Pull over.

51:59.757 --> 52:02.682
Pull over and stop.

52:11.202 --> 52:12.967
Okay, asshole...

52:13.805 --> 52:15.331
get out!

52:15.440 --> 52:17.040
What, right here?

52:17.041 --> 52:21.104
My car's all the way over in Edna.
That's a four- or five-mile walk.

52:30.621 --> 52:32.318
Come here, you.

52:37.495 --> 52:40.597
I ain't known you a half hour,
and you're talking shit to me...

52:40.598 --> 52:42.699
out of the side of your face.

52:42.700 --> 52:47.137
I say I want nobody working for this guy,
and he's got a dozen people living here!

52:47.138 --> 52:49.639
The cops set up a grandstand
to watch the show...

52:49.640 --> 52:52.565
and you don't even know they're cops.

52:53.878 --> 52:57.111
I don't see where you're
doing me any good at all.

52:57.782 --> 53:01.310
But I watched him for you,
didn't I, so he wouldn't run?

53:01.652 --> 53:03.041
Yeah.

53:03.421 --> 53:05.755
Well, you better run off now.

53:06.224 --> 53:08.759
And you better do
just like Lundy says.

53:08.760 --> 53:11.361
And don't you ever, ever...

53:11.362 --> 53:13.593
talk no shit to me again!

53:14.332 --> 53:15.892
Do you hear?

53:16.100 --> 53:17.524
Yes, sir.

53:23.708 --> 53:25.700
Let's get out of here.

54:29.173 --> 54:31.241
Hi, Frank. Good to have you back.

54:31.242 --> 54:34.578
Hey, man, that was beautiful.
You beat them again.

54:34.579 --> 54:37.379
What are you guys,
just standing around?

54:48.693 --> 54:50.460
- Hello, Richard.
- Wiley.

54:50.461 --> 54:52.658
- Hello, Frank.
- Hello, Dick.

54:54.031 --> 54:55.420
Hey...

54:58.035 --> 55:00.835
- How do you like it?
- It's not bad.

55:01.806 --> 55:03.573
It looks like a dude ranch.

55:03.574 --> 55:06.276
It belongs to a stockbroker
I once represented.

55:06.277 --> 55:08.941
Yeah? And where's he? In jail?

55:09.614 --> 55:11.848
Lewisburg, as a matter of fact.

55:11.849 --> 55:13.546
I figured that.

55:14.185 --> 55:18.146
Conspiring, they say, to defraud
the United States government.

55:19.524 --> 55:22.415
I'll have one, too. I can use it.

55:22.693 --> 55:25.960
Frank, where you been?
Looking at melon fields?

55:26.664 --> 55:28.231
I've been busy.

55:28.232 --> 55:33.403
You're out on a $5,000 bond, pending
a District Court examination in 10 days.

55:33.404 --> 55:35.305
What are you talking about?

55:35.306 --> 55:37.040
I thought I was clear.

55:37.041 --> 55:40.342
You are. But they have to
go through the motions.

55:41.913 --> 55:45.305
Frank, this is not the time
to do anything impulsive.

55:46.684 --> 55:49.211
There's a melon I've got to pick.

55:50.021 --> 55:53.123
Also, there are some very big
offers that have come in.

55:53.124 --> 55:57.358
Big offers from big people.
Now what am I supposed to tell them?

55:57.762 --> 56:01.097
- You tell them I got something to do.
- Frank.

56:02.099 --> 56:04.490
Hey, if they don't like it...

56:05.002 --> 56:06.664
tough shit.

56:06.804 --> 56:08.193
Okay?

56:10.308 --> 56:11.697
Wiley!

56:56.821 --> 56:59.781
Vincent, I think
we're going to do it.

57:00.691 --> 57:02.892
If we can keep him from goofing off.

57:02.893 --> 57:04.385
Thank you.

57:04.428 --> 57:08.355
Hey, didn't somebody say something
about a cold beer after work?

57:09.900 --> 57:11.267
What about you?

57:11.268 --> 57:12.402
Sure.

57:12.403 --> 57:14.404
- You buying?
- Damn right.

57:14.405 --> 57:16.640
I'm gonna be a rich
man in about a week.

57:16.641 --> 57:18.561
Hey, Larry, what about
you and the missus?

57:18.562 --> 57:23.469
Oh, no. Ma'am and me got more important
things to do. We are going to bed.

57:23.547 --> 57:26.541
You got that much energy,
back to the field.

57:27.385 --> 57:28.911
Good night.

57:39.597 --> 57:42.090
Now where in the hell's he going?

59:28.038 --> 59:30.673
He must have got hit by a truck.

59:30.674 --> 59:32.302
Or something.

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.654
You want to wait for him?

01:00:12.655 --> 01:00:15.148
With a dead cop across the road?

01:00:15.792 --> 01:00:18.422
- Let's talk to the help.
- Right.

01:00:53.830 --> 01:00:57.063
Come on, get outside.
Get her out. Get out!

01:00:59.636 --> 01:01:01.069
Where is he?

01:01:01.070 --> 01:01:04.166
I don't know. I thought he was home.

01:01:19.088 --> 01:01:21.183
No!

01:01:26.829 --> 01:01:28.397
Where is he?

01:01:28.398 --> 01:01:31.130
If we knew, I would tell you.

01:01:32.235 --> 01:01:35.035
Bring him along.

01:01:46.583 --> 01:01:48.245
Ask them.

01:01:51.321 --> 01:01:55.452
Amigos! We're looking for your boss.

01:01:56.926 --> 01:01:58.884
El jefe.

01:01:59.529 --> 01:02:02.420
Who wants to tell me where he's at?

01:02:05.168 --> 01:02:07.069
They don't know nothing.

01:02:07.070 --> 01:02:09.370
We're wasting our time.

01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:13.475
Tell them they don't
work here anymore.

01:02:13.476 --> 01:02:15.577
You all don't work here anymore.

01:02:15.578 --> 01:02:18.614
You got two minutes to get in
your cars and get out, now.

01:02:18.615 --> 01:02:21.416
- We been...
- Keep talking, you get your head busted.

01:02:21.417 --> 01:02:24.877
- Let's go.
- All right, kids, come on.

01:02:43.473 --> 01:02:45.898
Well, the man's been busy.

01:02:46.809 --> 01:02:48.301
Yeah.

01:02:51.681 --> 01:02:55.244
You know, he said all he wanted
was to get his melons in.

01:03:08.965 --> 01:03:11.390
Get the man's melons in.

01:03:12.468 --> 01:03:15.393
You heard him. Get the melons in.

01:03:21.944 --> 01:03:23.777
Go ahead.

01:04:13.629 --> 01:04:16.431
Was she blonde, blue eyes?

01:04:16.432 --> 01:04:18.867
Blonde, most of the time.

01:04:18.868 --> 01:04:21.837
Do you ever put your
hair up in rollers?

01:04:21.838 --> 01:04:24.468
Once in a while. Why?

01:04:26.876 --> 01:04:31.337
When I picture my ex-wife,
I think of her with rollers.

01:04:32.148 --> 01:04:36.184
She was always fiddling with her hair,
washing it, that sort of thing.

01:04:36.185 --> 01:04:38.382
Do you have any kids?

01:04:39.122 --> 01:04:41.649
A daughter. 7 years old.

01:04:41.924 --> 01:04:43.791
Do you miss her?

01:04:44.894 --> 01:04:49.822
I haven't seen them in two years.
They moved to Los Angeles.

01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:53.927
Are you thinking about them?

01:04:54.570 --> 01:04:59.430
No, I was thinking you might be
worthwhile getting to know better.

01:05:00.977 --> 01:05:04.546
Well, I'll fill out an application.
You read it. See if I pass.

01:05:04.547 --> 01:05:06.676
Acting tough again.

01:05:30.006 --> 01:05:33.008
Fact is, you're a very pretty girl.

01:05:33.009 --> 01:05:36.044
If you want to go to bed with
me, why don't you say it?

01:05:36.045 --> 01:05:39.141
Don't want to say it,
I want to do it. Come on.

01:05:39.282 --> 01:05:43.151
I have to go to the ladies'
room, if it isn't locked.

01:05:43.152 --> 01:05:45.952
If it is, I'll kick the door down.

01:05:57.366 --> 01:06:00.098
How you doing there, buddy?

01:06:02.672 --> 01:06:04.471
Okay?

01:06:05.208 --> 01:06:08.577
I just came by to tell you something.
Maybe you know it already.

01:06:08.578 --> 01:06:12.778
But I want to make sure.
I'm gonna kill you.

01:06:14.116 --> 01:06:17.007
Hey, there's a couple
of cops over there.

01:06:17.053 --> 01:06:18.920
Yeah.

01:06:20.623 --> 01:06:23.548
Otherwise you might be dead already.

01:06:25.394 --> 01:06:28.490
When is this big event
gonna take place?

01:06:28.631 --> 01:06:33.331
What's the difference?
Tomorrow. Next week.

01:06:33.369 --> 01:06:36.538
You can hide in the basement
of that police station.

01:06:36.539 --> 01:06:39.237
But I'm gonna get you, my baby.

01:06:41.677 --> 01:06:45.308
Seems like there's no use trying
to get on your good side.

01:06:59.896 --> 01:07:02.526
Hey, why don't you call a cop?

01:07:08.204 --> 01:07:10.572
The light's been left on.

01:07:23.719 --> 01:07:25.279
Nancy!

01:08:09.365 --> 01:08:12.666
I took my wife and the
kids to her mother's.

01:08:13.803 --> 01:08:16.237
- Did you talk to the police?
- Sure.

01:08:16.238 --> 01:08:19.307
They ask me questions.
But what can I tell them?

01:08:19.308 --> 01:08:22.410
Some men came.
I didn't know who they were.

01:08:22.411 --> 01:08:27.077
They say leave, or get our
heads busted. Just like that.

01:08:27.316 --> 01:08:28.817
Do one thing for me.

01:08:28.818 --> 01:08:32.487
Take this load in. Drop her
off at the bus station.

01:08:32.488 --> 01:08:34.255
What do you mean, one thing?

01:08:34.256 --> 01:08:37.926
I'll come back and get the
whole damn thing picked.

01:08:37.926 --> 01:08:40.352
No, it's finished, Larry.

01:08:43.499 --> 01:08:45.433
A lot of them are still good.

01:08:45.434 --> 01:08:48.462
Yeah, Larry's gonna
take this load in.

01:08:48.504 --> 01:08:51.906
He'll drop you off in town.
You can catch a bus there.

01:08:51.907 --> 01:08:53.365
Why?

01:08:55.011 --> 01:08:58.212
That guy, Renda, will be back.

01:08:58.214 --> 01:09:01.549
There's no reason for
you to be here anymore.

01:09:01.617 --> 01:09:03.779
Get yourself ready.

01:09:08.491 --> 01:09:09.957
Hey, Vincent.

01:09:09.959 --> 01:09:13.728
I've been in a car that was shot at,
and the guy next to me was killed.

01:09:13.729 --> 01:09:16.965
Another time, a truck chased a bunch
of us, trying to run us over.

01:09:16.966 --> 01:09:21.536
I've been in a union hall when they
threw a firebomb and blew the place up.

01:09:21.537 --> 01:09:24.633
I don't need anyone
looking out for me.

01:09:25.408 --> 01:09:27.173
Vincent...

01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:31.743
If you don't want me here,
now, that's something else.

01:09:33.916 --> 01:09:36.443
I don't want you here.

01:10:22.098 --> 01:10:26.501
The bus to La Junta always stops here.
Don't worry about missing it.

01:10:26.502 --> 01:10:29.302
Thanks, Larry. Good luck to you.

01:10:31.273 --> 01:10:34.699
Nancy, later you come
back and see us, okay?

01:11:26.996 --> 01:11:29.564
That's not Majestyk,
that's Larry Mendoza.

01:11:29.565 --> 01:11:31.796
Yeah, I recognize him.

01:11:31.934 --> 01:11:33.892
Boy just didn't listen to me.

01:12:07.536 --> 01:12:09.003
Hey, Larry.

01:12:09.004 --> 01:12:12.896
You were told to get out and
not come back. Ain't that right?

01:12:13.275 --> 01:12:17.202
I'm just helping my friend,
delivering some melons.

01:12:19.515 --> 01:12:22.884
You get a chance to run and
don't use it. Ain't that right?

01:12:22.885 --> 01:12:27.847
I just get rid of these
melons, and I am gone.

01:12:30.693 --> 01:12:32.293
You never see me again.

01:12:32.294 --> 01:12:34.059
Come on, Larry.

01:12:36.398 --> 01:12:38.322
Honest to God.

01:12:39.401 --> 01:12:42.702
- I just work for the guy, that's all.
- That's right.

01:13:03.492 --> 01:13:07.595
For Larry Mendoza. Tell me what
room you think he'll be in...

01:13:07.596 --> 01:13:10.396
when they bring him out of surgery.

01:13:10.466 --> 01:13:12.734
- Where is he?
- He's in there.

01:13:12.735 --> 01:13:16.730
The warehouse guy didn't see anything.
He didn't even see the car.

01:13:17.206 --> 01:13:18.906
What'd they do to him?

01:13:18.907 --> 01:13:21.104
They broke his legs.

01:13:37.059 --> 01:13:38.790
I'm sorry.

01:13:46.101 --> 01:13:47.866
Hey, Larry.

01:13:53.275 --> 01:13:55.540
I'm real sorry, man.

01:13:55.778 --> 01:13:57.611
Vincent.

01:13:59.181 --> 01:14:03.284
Larry, who were they? Do you
know them? Know who they were?

01:14:03.285 --> 01:14:06.848
Yeah. Same people
who came last night.

01:14:08.590 --> 01:14:11.982
And Bobby Kopas. He was there.

01:14:14.296 --> 01:14:18.427
They're not kidding.
They do this to me...

01:14:18.734 --> 01:14:21.193
they're gonna kill you!

01:14:33.849 --> 01:14:38.015
Do you want me to
feel better? Go away.

01:14:38.287 --> 01:14:40.655
Hide somewhere.

01:14:41.357 --> 01:14:44.658
There's nothing wrong with that.

01:14:47.396 --> 01:14:50.298
Sure as hell...

01:14:50.299 --> 01:14:52.599
you're going to be dead.

01:15:09.551 --> 01:15:14.088
Majestyk, I'm sorry
about your hired man.

01:15:14.089 --> 01:15:16.090
He's not just a hired man.

01:15:16.091 --> 01:15:18.426
A deputy was killed last night.

01:15:18.427 --> 01:15:22.797
Run over or beaten to death.
About the same time your migrants left.

01:15:22.798 --> 01:15:25.366
We'd like to locate
them, talk to them.

01:15:25.367 --> 01:15:28.469
Why don't you talk to
Frank Renda instead?

01:15:28.470 --> 01:15:31.139
The Denver police have got
a watch on his place.

01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:34.475
He hasn't been there.
We don't know where he is.

01:15:34.476 --> 01:15:38.980
You don't know much about anything.
Stay the hell away from me.

01:15:38.981 --> 01:15:41.872
We pull out, you know what'll happen.

01:15:43.252 --> 01:15:47.179
Well, let's see what's happened
with you hanging around.

01:15:47.956 --> 01:15:51.723
So far, he's managed
to run off my crew...

01:15:51.894 --> 01:15:54.128
shoot up some melons...

01:15:54.129 --> 01:15:58.226
break my friend's legs,
and kill one of your deputies.

01:15:58.333 --> 01:16:01.531
Don't you talk to me
about police protection.

01:16:01.970 --> 01:16:04.372
Keep these hotshots off my property!

01:16:04.373 --> 01:16:07.341
You won't get those melons
picked if you're dead.

01:16:07.342 --> 01:16:09.444
If I'm dead it won't matter, will it?

01:16:09.445 --> 01:16:12.746
Suit yourself. You're on your own.

01:16:12.848 --> 01:16:16.513
Lieutenant, I've been on
my own from the beginning.

01:16:21.356 --> 01:16:23.057
Are we really pulling out?

01:16:23.058 --> 01:16:26.427
We'll let him think so
and see what happens.

01:17:30.292 --> 01:17:32.922
- By the truck. See him?
- Where?

01:17:37.199 --> 01:17:40.193
Damn, he was there a second ago.

01:17:41.136 --> 01:17:43.401
Did he go in the house?

01:17:43.639 --> 01:17:46.507
He must have.
That Mexican girl's inside.

01:17:46.508 --> 01:17:48.676
Where are your other boys?

01:17:48.677 --> 01:17:50.711
Round the back side of the house.

01:17:50.712 --> 01:17:53.581
You keep watching.
I'll go tell Frank what's going on.

01:17:53.582 --> 01:17:56.384
Ain't nothing going on,
as far as I can see.

01:17:56.385 --> 01:17:59.620
Sonny boy, if you try keeping your
eyes open and your mouth shut...

01:17:59.621 --> 01:18:01.989
you might see something!

01:18:23.745 --> 01:18:26.047
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

01:18:26.048 --> 01:18:27.548
I'll tell you one thing, though.

01:18:27.549 --> 01:18:30.084
I'm not going to worry about it.
His truck's there.

01:18:30.085 --> 01:18:31.577
Yeah?

01:19:17.699 --> 01:19:20.431
What the hell are you doing here?

01:19:21.403 --> 01:19:23.204
I hitched a ride back.

01:19:23.205 --> 01:19:26.273
There's a bunch of guys outside
with guns. They see you come in?

01:19:26.274 --> 01:19:29.108
I don't know. I didn't see anybody.

01:19:29.311 --> 01:19:31.245
I think you're stuck with me.

01:19:31.246 --> 01:19:33.341
Yeah, sure.

01:19:33.782 --> 01:19:37.276
Till I figure out a way
to get you out of here.

01:19:37.285 --> 01:19:41.621
At least I don't think they'll do
anything until Renda shows up.

01:19:47.663 --> 01:19:50.097
Do you know how to use this?

01:19:50.098 --> 01:19:54.059
You point it and pull the trigger.
Isn't that all you do?

01:19:54.236 --> 01:19:56.001
Never mind.

01:19:56.905 --> 01:19:59.774
As long as you're here,
sit over by the window.

01:19:59.775 --> 01:20:02.905
If you see anything
move, just tell me.

01:20:03.211 --> 01:20:04.703
Okay.

01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:34.208
Picked up his trailer, went home.

01:20:34.209 --> 01:20:35.276
Alone?

01:20:35.277 --> 01:20:37.511
He was. Kopas says
there's a girl there now.

01:20:37.512 --> 01:20:39.547
Came before the dude got back.

01:20:39.548 --> 01:20:43.117
Man's waiting to get shot, and he's
got his girlfriend there with him.

01:20:43.118 --> 01:20:45.453
Probably figured I wouldn't
come for him so soon.

01:20:45.454 --> 01:20:47.421
- Maybe.
- Get yourself a drink.

01:20:47.422 --> 01:20:51.892
Thank you. We can't just walk in there.
The cops could be waiting for us.

01:20:51.893 --> 01:20:54.095
Got to figure something out.

01:20:54.096 --> 01:20:56.997
Look, I got no time to
fool around here anymore.

01:20:56.998 --> 01:20:59.900
You want to hit him yourself,
wait for the right time.

01:20:59.901 --> 01:21:03.031
I don't have the time!
You understand?

01:21:16.351 --> 01:21:20.118
I don't know how much longer
that Renda's gonna wait.

01:21:21.623 --> 01:21:25.220
But I'm not. I'm going to
turn this situation around.

01:22:03.799 --> 01:22:06.099
Good morning, Mr. Renda.

01:22:06.735 --> 01:22:08.302
Got him for you.

01:22:08.303 --> 01:22:11.305
Sure as hell he's in the house.
There's no way to get out.

01:22:11.306 --> 01:22:13.040
You seen him?

01:22:13.041 --> 01:22:15.976
I figure he's locked
himself up in the toilet.

01:22:15.977 --> 01:22:19.437
Either that, or else he's
hiding under the bed.

01:22:19.548 --> 01:22:21.749
I just asked you a question, man.

01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:25.452
Well, no, sir. Ain't seen no
sign of him, but he's in there.

01:22:25.453 --> 01:22:28.522
There ain't no other
place he could be.

01:22:28.523 --> 01:22:32.359
Okay now, we're gonna bring
him out. Nice and quietly.

01:22:32.494 --> 01:22:36.193
- Walk him to the car.
- The broad, too.

01:22:38.667 --> 01:22:41.900
Mr. Renda, what if he's got a gun?

01:22:42.537 --> 01:22:45.804
We'll just have to take it
away from him, won't we?

01:22:46.308 --> 01:22:49.977
Now, you're gonna get to
go through that door first.

01:22:49.978 --> 01:22:52.141
We'll be right behind you.

01:22:53.882 --> 01:22:55.943
Mr. Renda, I...

01:22:57.285 --> 01:23:00.279
I ain't never done this
kind of thing before.

01:23:00.622 --> 01:23:02.022
I mean...

01:23:02.023 --> 01:23:04.592
maybe I'm no good at it.
You know what I mean?

01:23:04.593 --> 01:23:07.018
You are gonna be just fine.

01:23:08.230 --> 01:23:11.793
And I said, you are going
through that door first.

01:23:13.301 --> 01:23:15.396
We'll be right behind you.

01:23:15.637 --> 01:23:17.732
You're gonna be fine.

01:23:29.084 --> 01:23:31.252
You put this stuff in
the back of the truck.

01:23:31.253 --> 01:23:34.688
Once you start, don't stop or even
slow down till you get to the café.

01:23:34.689 --> 01:23:36.857
- You can't...
- Listen to what I'm saying.

01:23:36.858 --> 01:23:40.527
When you get to the café, stop, get out
as fast as you can, don't look back.

01:23:40.528 --> 01:23:43.055
You can't do it alone.
You need someone.

01:23:44.232 --> 01:23:46.600
What you're doing's enough.

01:23:46.868 --> 01:23:49.236
Here are the keys.

01:24:23.405 --> 01:24:24.931
Move!

01:24:26.207 --> 01:24:27.596
I knew it.

01:24:57.839 --> 01:25:01.008
Blue convertible, white top.
Heading west on the highway.

01:25:01.009 --> 01:25:03.243
- 7-8 stand by.
- What is it, Hal?

01:25:03.244 --> 01:25:05.913
Renda's on his tail.
They're going west on the highway.

01:25:05.914 --> 01:25:08.248
- Okay, put everything we got on it.
- Yes, sir.

01:25:08.249 --> 01:25:10.412
Call the airport.
Get me a helicopter.

01:25:28.103 --> 01:25:31.438
What the hell you doing?
You're going the wrong way.

01:26:19.421 --> 01:26:21.955
There's a highway on the
other side of that field.

01:26:21.956 --> 01:26:26.053
- They're probably headed for that.
- Straight ahead. First road on the left.

01:27:24.018 --> 01:27:26.443
Keep going and don't lose 'em.

01:27:46.207 --> 01:27:47.972
Stop!

01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:53.313
Move over.

01:27:53.314 --> 01:27:55.816
Guess there's no way to
get rid of you, is there?

01:27:55.817 --> 01:27:58.549
I told you, you were stuck with me.

01:28:25.547 --> 01:28:27.814
Tell them to look down there.

01:28:27.815 --> 01:28:30.046
Take a look down that way.

01:30:47.322 --> 01:30:49.781
This is his hunting country.

01:30:50.458 --> 01:30:52.416
He brought us here.

01:30:53.194 --> 01:30:56.495
It looks like we're only a
couple of miles from the lodge.

01:30:57.865 --> 01:31:00.563
Do you want to go to
the lodge, or what?

01:31:00.568 --> 01:31:02.731
He sucked us in.

01:31:04.105 --> 01:31:06.837
That melon picker sucked us in.

01:32:07.301 --> 01:32:11.467
- Come in, F-4J.
- The 201 now heading south.

01:32:11.572 --> 01:32:14.641
Looks like a blue convertible
with a white top...

01:32:14.642 --> 01:32:18.671
about a half a mile ahead of the pickup.
And he's really moving.

01:32:19.046 --> 01:32:21.748
Just a minute, he's pulled
a disappearing act on us.

01:32:21.749 --> 01:32:24.785
They must've turned off on
a trail through the timber.

01:32:24.786 --> 01:32:27.586
Hang on and I'll give
you some coordinates.

01:32:36.364 --> 01:32:39.198
I never seem to catch the
beginning of anything.

01:32:41.235 --> 01:32:43.933
Somebody want to tell
me what's going on?

01:32:44.639 --> 01:32:47.337
- Frank?
- Just relax, will you?

01:32:47.375 --> 01:32:50.107
Well, should I start packing or what?

01:32:50.344 --> 01:32:52.512
You know, I think
he's in those trees.

01:32:52.513 --> 01:32:56.041
- You're seeing something I don't see.
- Will you shut up?

01:32:56.818 --> 01:32:59.413
Hand me those glasses, Wiley.

01:33:03.558 --> 01:33:05.448
Get over here.

01:33:28.082 --> 01:33:32.018
Come on, Frank, let's finish it!
I got work to do.

01:33:32.019 --> 01:33:33.909
How about this guy?

01:33:34.155 --> 01:33:36.284
He's anxious?

01:33:40.695 --> 01:33:43.893
Wiley, you're going
out to talk to him.

01:34:54.769 --> 01:34:56.659
Where are you?

01:35:01.842 --> 01:35:05.109
- Well, it's been nice talking to you.
- Hey, Wiley.

01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:06.846
Yeah?

01:35:06.847 --> 01:35:08.578
Come here.

01:35:22.997 --> 01:35:25.532
You go back in there
and tell Frank...

01:35:25.533 --> 01:35:29.502
if he wants to settle this thing
between us, we haven't got much time.

01:35:29.503 --> 01:35:31.928
The police are on their way.

01:35:32.974 --> 01:35:36.810
You know, this really hasn't
got anything to do with me.

01:35:40.781 --> 01:35:42.614
Who's in there with him?

01:35:44.785 --> 01:35:46.880
Lundy and Kopas.

01:35:47.655 --> 01:35:49.113
Nancy.

01:35:50.491 --> 01:35:53.994
Take her and go back to the highway.
Wait for me there.

01:35:53.995 --> 01:35:57.728
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know yet. I'll take this shotgun.

01:36:17.151 --> 01:36:19.319
Where'd she go, Mr. Renda?

01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:21.278
He must have grabbed her.

01:36:21.622 --> 01:36:23.011
Yeah.

01:36:23.290 --> 01:36:26.059
Maybe they left.
And he took her with 'em.

01:36:26.060 --> 01:36:27.927
He's still there.

01:37:35.730 --> 01:37:37.764
Let's go upstairs.

01:37:37.765 --> 01:37:40.793
- Maybe we can spot him from there.
- Yeah.

01:37:59.453 --> 01:38:02.756
I didn't tell you to come upstairs.
You go downstairs and watch.

01:38:02.757 --> 01:38:06.149
I'll do it, Frank. You spot him,
I'll flush him out for you.

01:39:27.274 --> 01:39:29.509
Lundy, he's going back in the woods.

01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:31.309
- Get him!
- Where?

01:39:47.928 --> 01:39:50.319
You never saw him at all.

01:39:51.765 --> 01:39:54.156
You just told Lundy that.

01:40:00.774 --> 01:40:02.505
You used Lundy.

01:40:06.714 --> 01:40:09.912
You used him to set him up.

01:40:14.255 --> 01:40:16.623
I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

01:40:16.891 --> 01:40:20.226
I don't give a damn about
that melon picker.

01:40:22.563 --> 01:40:25.465
This is none of my
business, you know.

01:40:25.466 --> 01:40:27.697
This is none of my business.

01:40:28.235 --> 01:40:30.830
I don't want nothing to
do with this anymore!

01:40:31.171 --> 01:40:32.505
Stay away from me.

01:40:32.506 --> 01:40:34.407
- You get out there.
- No.

01:40:34.408 --> 01:40:35.975
Get out there!

01:40:35.976 --> 01:40:39.012
- I don't even have a gun. He'll kill me!
- You got a choice.

01:40:39.013 --> 01:40:41.210
Stay here and I'll kill you.

01:40:42.016 --> 01:40:43.542
I'm staying.

01:40:50.925 --> 01:40:52.485
Hey!

01:40:56.430 --> 01:40:58.263
Where is he?

01:41:02.503 --> 01:41:04.370
He's on the staircase.

01:41:10.444 --> 01:41:12.471
You want to live?

01:41:12.846 --> 01:41:14.047
Yeah.

01:41:14.048 --> 01:41:17.483
Drape yourself over that
log and don't even twitch.

01:41:17.484 --> 01:41:19.078
Do it.

01:41:40.708 --> 01:41:42.405
Hey, boy.

01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:02.726
Check him, Richie. Bob?

01:42:04.531 --> 01:42:06.364
Bring him in.

01:42:09.203 --> 01:42:10.636
I'll take that.

01:42:10.637 --> 01:42:12.504
Hey, buddy.

01:42:13.407 --> 01:42:16.367
Like I said, you're in
the wrong business.

01:42:24.351 --> 01:42:27.413
- Where's Renda?
- He's out in back, dead.

01:42:27.588 --> 01:42:31.389
Get in your truck.
I want to talk to you in town.

01:42:41.402 --> 01:42:43.099
Let's go.

01:42:49.043 --> 01:42:51.172
Hey, Lieutenant...

01:42:52.246 --> 01:42:53.479
you were right.

01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:55.711
He was really trying to kill me.

01:42:56.305 --> 01:43:02.811
