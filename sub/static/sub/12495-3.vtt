08:58.413 --> 09:00.832
for my birthday,

09:00.874 --> 09:02.250
and then Jasper shows up,

09:03.168 --> 09:04.878
and then the horse

09:03.168 --> 09:04.878
kicks Jasper in the face.

09:06.838 --> 09:08.923
But I end up

09:06.838 --> 09:08.923
being okay, right?

09:10.050 --> 09:11.009
No.

09:13.345 --> 09:14.721
We're home.

09:14.762 --> 09:16.597
Henry,

09:14.762 --> 09:16.597
come help me, please.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.059
Henry,

09:17.057 --> 09:19.059
come help your mother.

09:19.767 --> 09:21.269
What, what, what?

09:21.311 --> 09:23.021
We got everything you need

09:23.063 --> 09:24.814
for you to make your chili balls

09:23.063 --> 09:24.814
for dinner tonight.

09:24.856 --> 09:27.817
Oh, no, no, no.

09:24.856 --> 09:27.817
I cannot make dinner tonight.

09:27.859 --> 09:29.403
We already bought everything.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.112
And it is your night.

09:31.154 --> 09:33.573
Make 'em spicy this time.

09:33.614 --> 09:36.993
Mom, seriously,

09:33.614 --> 09:36.993
I'm, like, so busy,

09:33.614 --> 09:36.993
I don't have time.

09:37.035 --> 09:37.994
Hey, Piper.

09:38.745 --> 09:41.164
Oh, man, Jasper's here?

09:41.206 --> 09:42.957
Piper, be nice.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.043
But Jasper's always here.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.170
It's not okay.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.506
I'm going to the bathroom.

09:49.548 --> 09:50.965
Oh no, Mom.

09:51.007 --> 09:53.301
Jasper's going

09:51.007 --> 09:53.301
to use our bathroom.

09:54.886 --> 09:56.679
We'll be all right.

09:57.389 --> 09:58.473
Hey, everyone.

09:58.515 --> 09:59.807
Hi, honey.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.642
Hey, Mr. Hart.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.642
Charlotte.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.562
Jasper's in the bathroom.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.480
Ah, geez.

10:05.522 --> 10:08.233
And Henry said

10:05.522 --> 10:08.233
he didn't want to make dinner.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.193
What? It's his night.

10:10.235 --> 10:12.153
I'm going to make dinner.

10:13.363 --> 10:16.366
Um, Henry,

10:13.363 --> 10:16.366
before you start...

10:18.868 --> 10:20.036
What's up?

10:20.078 --> 10:21.621
I got a call at work today

10:21.662 --> 10:24.249
from one of your teachers,

10:21.662 --> 10:24.249
Miss Shapen?

10:24.291 --> 10:26.751
Wh--

10:24.291 --> 10:26.751
She called you at work?

10:27.877 --> 10:29.921
That's so rude of her.

10:31.590 --> 10:33.550
Apparently you fell asleep

10:31.590 --> 10:33.550
in class today

10:33.592 --> 10:35.552
and failed your

10:33.592 --> 10:35.552
Puerto Rican history test.

10:35.594 --> 10:37.554
Well...

10:37.596 --> 10:41.182
Do you realize how important

10:37.596 --> 10:41.182
Puerto Rican history is?

10:42.142 --> 10:43.560
Yeah.

10:43.602 --> 10:45.145
I'm sorry

10:43.602 --> 10:45.145
I fell asleep in class.

10:45.395 --> 10:47.063
Well, your teacher says

10:45.395 --> 10:47.063
it's been happening a lot.

10:47.105 --> 10:49.065
Falling asleep in class,

10:47.105 --> 10:49.065
not doing your homework.

10:49.107 --> 10:50.233
I know, it's...

10:50.275 --> 10:52.819
It's just kind of tough

10:50.275 --> 10:52.819
with school

10:52.860 --> 10:55.655
and my new job

10:52.860 --> 10:55.655
at Junk-N-Stuff.

10:55.947 --> 10:57.365
Well, if you can't

10:55.947 --> 10:57.365
keep your grades up,

10:57.407 --> 10:58.866
you're going to have

10:57.407 --> 10:58.866
to quit your job.

10:58.908 --> 11:01.911
I can't quit.

10:58.908 --> 11:01.911
My job's a really big deal.

11:01.953 --> 11:03.622
It's a junk shop.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.832
You sweep the floors.

11:07.917 --> 11:10.378
Miss Shapen said I can

11:07.917 --> 11:10.378
take a makeup test

11:07.917 --> 11:10.378
before school on Friday.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.380
I expect an "A".

11:10.420 --> 11:12.380
You got it.

11:12.422 --> 11:13.840
I'll go upstairs

11:12.422 --> 11:13.840
and study right now.

11:13.881 --> 11:15.592
Hey, whoa, whoa.

11:13.881 --> 11:15.592
Hey, hey, hey.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.553
You study after

11:16.176 --> 11:18.553
you make the chili balls.

11:18.595 --> 11:19.971
But--

11:20.013 --> 11:21.640
And make 'em spicy

11:20.013 --> 11:21.640
this time.

11:21.680 --> 11:22.807
Yeah!

11:28.188 --> 11:29.523
Okay.

11:29.564 --> 11:30.689
Chili balls.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.027
Finally.

11:34.068 --> 11:37.822
Ah, ah, ah!

11:34.068 --> 11:37.822
Piper, no computers

11:34.068 --> 11:37.822
at the dinner table.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.866
But this morning

11:37.864 --> 11:39.866
I posted a comment

11:39.907 --> 11:42.285
and my comment

11:39.907 --> 11:42.285
has over 45 comments,

11:42.327 --> 11:44.996
so now I have to comment

11:42.327 --> 11:44.996
on the comments.

11:46.247 --> 11:47.874
I'm about to comment on you.

11:48.667 --> 11:49.917
What?

11:49.959 --> 11:51.752
(watch beeping)

11:52.546 --> 11:54.631
Uh, sorry,

11:52.546 --> 11:54.631
too tired to eat.

11:54.673 --> 11:55.798
Got to go to bed.

11:58.552 --> 12:00.303
More balls for us.

12:01.762 --> 12:04.098
(watch continues beeping)

12:07.477 --> 12:09.646
Henry, why aren't you

12:07.477 --> 12:09.646
on your way here?

12:09.688 --> 12:11.939
Because I got in trouble

12:09.688 --> 12:11.939
for sleeping in class today

12:11.981 --> 12:13.900
and I had to make chili balls.

12:13.941 --> 12:16.403
Chili balls?

12:16.444 --> 12:17.945
It was my night.

12:19.656 --> 12:21.324
Kid, there's been an escape

12:19.656 --> 12:21.324
from Swellview Prison.

12:19.656 --> 12:21.324
I need you.

12:21.366 --> 12:23.117
All right,

12:21.366 --> 12:23.117
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.203
Good.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.203
Run like a bunny.

12:28.747 --> 12:30.124
Okay.

12:31.334 --> 12:33.169
I just got to get

12:31.334 --> 12:33.169
my special gum.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.717
I can do this.

12:38.757 --> 12:39.967
I just...

12:40.009 --> 12:41.928
(shudders)

12:40.009 --> 12:41.928
Wake up. Wake up.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.056
Just got to stand up.

12:46.933 --> 12:48.142
And maybe...

12:49.810 --> 12:50.895
Just...

12:52.188 --> 12:53.565
Run like a bunny.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.194
Run little bunny.

13:05.619 --> 13:07.454
(watch beeping)

13:10.915 --> 13:12.667
(grunts)

13:13.876 --> 13:14.961
Henry!

13:15.002 --> 13:16.921
(knocking)

13:15.002 --> 13:16.921
Henry, open up!

13:37.567 --> 13:39.277
(watch stops beeping)

13:44.658 --> 13:46.284
Ugh, what is that smell?

13:46.326 --> 13:48.077
I'm that smell.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.077
Wh--

13:48.119 --> 13:50.580
Captain Man?

13:48.119 --> 13:50.580
What are you doing here?

13:50.622 --> 13:52.540
What are you doing here?

13:50.622 --> 13:52.540
Huh?

13:52.582 --> 13:53.792
I called you 90 minutes ago

13:53.832 --> 13:55.669
and I told you

13:53.832 --> 13:55.669
we had an emergency.

13:55.710 --> 13:57.671
Oh, right. I...

13:57.712 --> 13:58.963
I guess I fell asleep.

13:59.005 --> 14:00.839
(mocking)

13:59.005 --> 14:00.839
"I guess I fell asleep."

14:02.841 --> 14:05.345
(sniffs)

14:02.841 --> 14:05.345
Ugh, why do you stink?

14:05.386 --> 14:08.389
I stink because I just

14:05.386 --> 14:08.389
spent the last hour

14:08.431 --> 14:11.351
chasing three criminals

14:08.431 --> 14:11.351
through the Swellview sewer.

14:11.392 --> 14:12.935
You know what's down

14:11.392 --> 14:12.935
in the Swellview sewer?

14:13.687 --> 14:15.146
Poop?

14:13.687 --> 14:15.146
Poop!

14:16.105 --> 14:18.149
(Piper) Henry! Hey!

14:16.105 --> 14:18.149
(banging)

14:18.191 --> 14:19.693
Oh, my sister.

14:19.734 --> 14:21.068
We have a lot

14:19.734 --> 14:21.068
to talk about.

14:21.110 --> 14:22.654
Just get--

14:21.110 --> 14:22.654
Don't you push me.

14:24.405 --> 14:26.491
(screams)

14:27.116 --> 14:28.409
I'm okay!

14:31.579 --> 14:33.498
Who were you talking to

14:31.579 --> 14:33.498
in here?

14:33.540 --> 14:35.458
(scoffs) Nobody.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.458
Mom!

14:35.500 --> 14:37.168
Ah, geez.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.503
What is it, sweetie?

14:38.545 --> 14:40.714
Henry was talking

14:38.545 --> 14:40.714
to someone in his room

14:40.755 --> 14:42.965
and now he says

14:40.755 --> 14:42.965
nobody's in here.

14:43.007 --> 14:44.967
Well, I'm sure if Henry

14:43.007 --> 14:44.967
said nobody was in here, then--

14:46.302 --> 14:48.805
(sniffs)

14:46.302 --> 14:48.805
Ugh! What is that smell?

14:48.847 --> 14:51.098
Uh... it's Piper.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.267
What?

14:51.140 --> 14:53.267
She hasn't had

14:51.140 --> 14:53.267
a bath in a week.

14:53.309 --> 14:54.811
That's a lie.

14:54.853 --> 14:56.103
Okay, come on, baby,

14:56.145 --> 14:57.731
we're going to go

14:56.145 --> 14:57.731
get you a bath.

14:57.772 --> 14:58.981
I don't need a bath! Mom!

14:59.023 --> 15:00.859
(Mrs. Hart)

14:59.023 --> 15:00.859
It's just a bath.

15:02.652 --> 15:04.070
(screams)

15:04.945 --> 15:06.823
Don't sneak up on me

15:04.945 --> 15:06.823
like that.

15:06.865 --> 15:08.115
You disappointed me tonight.

15:08.949 --> 15:10.910
I'm disappointing everybody.

15:12.495 --> 15:15.498
People should just call me

15:12.495 --> 15:15.498
"Kid Disappointment."

15:15.998 --> 15:18.877
All right, well, just tell me

15:15.998 --> 15:18.877
what the problem is.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.796
Time. School.

15:21.838 --> 15:23.339
Working for you. My family.

15:23.381 --> 15:25.675
It's just...

15:23.381 --> 15:25.675
It's a lot to handle.

15:26.175 --> 15:27.051
Well...

15:28.386 --> 15:29.554
I do know a guy who could

15:28.386 --> 15:29.554
get rid of your family.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.305
What?

15:31.347 --> 15:32.891
Kidding. I joke.

15:33.892 --> 15:34.809
I do know a guy.

15:37.353 --> 15:40.189
Oh! I think

15:37.353 --> 15:40.189
I can fix your problem.

15:37.353 --> 15:40.189
Really?

15:40.231 --> 15:41.524
Meet me

15:40.231 --> 15:41.524
at headquarters tomorrow.

15:41.566 --> 15:42.901
I'm there.

15:43.484 --> 15:44.736
Hey.

15:46.654 --> 15:47.614
Who's this?

15:48.448 --> 15:49.115
My mom.

15:49.657 --> 15:50.991
Nice.

15:51.992 --> 15:54.078
She... She still married

15:51.992 --> 15:54.078
to your dad?

15:54.120 --> 15:55.455
Yes.

15:55.914 --> 15:57.707
She ever seem lonely

15:55.914 --> 15:57.707
or bored to you?

15:57.749 --> 15:58.917
Go home, Ray.

16:00.627 --> 16:01.461
The picture, ray.

16:01.502 --> 16:02.754
Yeah, all right.

16:06.549 --> 16:08.342
(bell rings)

16:08.384 --> 16:09.803
All right, class,

16:08.384 --> 16:09.803
everybody take your seats.

16:09.844 --> 16:10.887
Sit down.

16:10.929 --> 16:12.680
<i>Siéntense.</i>

16:13.848 --> 16:15.516
Hey,

16:13.848 --> 16:15.516
have you seen Henry?

16:15.558 --> 16:16.434
Uh-uh.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.728
Dang it, where's Henry Hart?

16:20.939 --> 16:23.065
Jasper?

16:20.939 --> 16:23.065
He's not here.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.110
I can see that.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.863
Uh, Henry's home sick.

16:28.905 --> 16:30.364
You said you didn't know

16:28.905 --> 16:30.364
where he was.

16:32.617 --> 16:35.829
Yes, but we know that Henry

16:32.617 --> 16:35.829
would be in school

16:35.870 --> 16:40.082
unless he was home sick

16:35.870 --> 16:40.082
or else he'll be in trouble.

16:40.708 --> 16:42.126
Oh, right.

16:42.794 --> 16:44.211
Henry has hepatitis.

16:51.970 --> 16:53.721
What's that thing doing?

16:53.763 --> 16:55.389
Scanning your brain.

16:55.431 --> 16:56.975
Oh, cool.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.310
Take a deep breath.

17:01.187 --> 17:03.898
Now, go,

17:01.187 --> 17:03.898
"ooodle, oodle, ooodle."

17:03.940 --> 17:06.651
Ooodle, oodle, ooodle.

17:06.693 --> 17:07.944
No, you're off key.

17:08.862 --> 17:11.155
It's ooodle, ooodle, ooodle.

17:11.197 --> 17:13.825
Ooodle, ooodle, oodle...

17:15.242 --> 17:16.953
Why am I doing this?

17:17.787 --> 17:20.039
Relax, kid.

17:17.787 --> 17:20.039
I can't.

17:20.080 --> 17:22.792
I got a huge

17:20.080 --> 17:22.792
makeup test tomorrow

17:20.080 --> 17:22.792
and I got to study,

17:22.834 --> 17:25.378
and you guys

17:22.834 --> 17:25.378
are making me go,

17:22.834 --> 17:25.378
ooodle, ooodle, ooodle.

17:25.419 --> 17:27.797
Oh, no, it's,

17:25.419 --> 17:27.797
ooodle, ooodle, ooodle.

17:27.839 --> 17:30.591
I don't care!

17:27.839 --> 17:30.591
I don't have time to relax.

17:30.633 --> 17:32.259
Exactly.

17:32.301 --> 17:34.178
Your only problem

17:32.301 --> 17:34.178
is a lack of time.

17:34.846 --> 17:37.139
Imagine if you could do

17:34.846 --> 17:37.139
all your studying for school

17:37.181 --> 17:38.558
in only 30 seconds.

17:38.599 --> 17:40.643
How can I learn anything

17:38.599 --> 17:40.643
in 30 seconds?

17:40.685 --> 17:44.022
With this.

17:40.685 --> 17:44.022
The cerebral data transducer.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.482
Or as we call it,

17:44.063 --> 17:46.482
the H.R.Z.

17:46.524 --> 17:49.903
This device can transfer

17:46.524 --> 17:49.903
knowledge from a data source

17:49.944 --> 17:51.153
directly into your brain.

17:51.195 --> 17:53.280
At 90 million

17:51.195 --> 17:53.280
digibles per second.

17:54.866 --> 17:56.492
Why am I locked in a chair?

17:56.534 --> 17:58.369
Do you want to get a good grade

17:56.534 --> 17:58.369
on your Puerto Rican math test?

17:58.411 --> 18:00.246
History.

17:58.411 --> 18:00.246
Same thing.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.122
Let us begin the procedure.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.123
Yeah, let's do it.

18:03.165 --> 18:04.042
All right.

18:05.334 --> 18:07.003
Now, I'll set the computer

18:07.045 --> 18:08.588
to acquire all the world's

18:07.045 --> 18:08.588
historical knowledge

18:08.629 --> 18:09.964
on Puerto Rico.

18:11.716 --> 18:13.718
Whoa, intense.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.511
But, uh, will this hurt?

18:15.553 --> 18:17.388
Yes, very much.

18:15.553 --> 18:17.388
What?

18:18.890 --> 18:20.307
Power up.

18:20.349 --> 18:21.559
(groans)

18:22.518 --> 18:23.436
(Henry) Sweet!

18:25.688 --> 18:27.231
Wait, so, how will I know--

18:27.273 --> 18:30.359
Whoa, it hurts!

18:30.401 --> 18:31.694
Just enjoy it.

18:31.736 --> 18:34.447
(screaming)

18:43.122 --> 18:45.583
(screaming)

18:51.047 --> 18:52.423
(groaning)

19:01.223 --> 19:02.391
Well?

19:02.433 --> 19:03.851
That hurt bad.

19:04.727 --> 19:06.854
Yes, but tell us

19:04.727 --> 19:06.854
about Puerto Rico.

19:06.896 --> 19:08.689
I don't know anything about--

19:08.731 --> 19:10.357
Puerto Rico is a series

19:08.731 --> 19:10.357
of islands

19:10.399 --> 19:12.192
with a land mass

19:10.399 --> 19:12.192
of 3,500 square miles

19:12.234 --> 19:14.487
and a population

19:12.234 --> 19:14.487
of 3.6 million people.

19:14.528 --> 19:16.489
Its glorious beaches

19:14.528 --> 19:16.489
and lush rainforests

19:16.530 --> 19:17.907
are the perfect setting

19:16.530 --> 19:17.907
for a wedding, bar mitzvah,

19:17.949 --> 19:19.492
or growing bananas.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.327
Oh.

19:21.368 --> 19:22.954
Whoa.

19:24.038 --> 19:25.665
I know Puerto Rico.

19:25.706 --> 19:27.000
Indeed.

19:27.041 --> 19:28.709
You see?

19:27.041 --> 19:28.709
With this you can learn

19:28.751 --> 19:30.336
anything you need

19:28.751 --> 19:30.336
to know for school

19:30.377 --> 19:31.129
in a matter of seconds.

19:32.088 --> 19:33.631
Yeah.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.800
Wait.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.800
You think it's cheating?

19:35.842 --> 19:38.011
Eh...

19:35.842 --> 19:38.011
No, not really.

19:35.842 --> 19:38.011
It's a gray area.

19:38.928 --> 19:40.096
I guess.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.016
Anyway, I really doing this

19:41.430 --> 19:43.016
appreciate you for me.

19:44.017 --> 19:46.352
Uh-oh.

19:44.017 --> 19:46.352
It's the side effects.

19:46.393 --> 19:47.687
What side effects?

19:47.728 --> 19:49.814
You see, after you use

19:47.728 --> 19:49.814
the H.R.Z.,

19:49.856 --> 19:53.026
when you talk, you might mix up

19:49.856 --> 19:53.026
your words for a few days.

19:53.067 --> 19:55.028
Well, you could have

19:53.067 --> 19:55.028
before that you told me.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.571
The important thing

19:57.613 --> 19:59.239
is that now you're going

19:57.613 --> 19:59.239
to do well on your test.

19:59.281 --> 20:00.491
Yeah.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.535
(girl scream)

20:04.411 --> 20:05.621
Why did I just--

20:05.663 --> 20:07.707
That's another side effect.

20:07.748 --> 20:09.249
Sometimes you'll

20:07.748 --> 20:09.249
scream like--

20:09.291 --> 20:10.710
(girl scream)

20:10.751 --> 20:11.919
A girl.

20:13.337 --> 20:15.131
For a few days.

20:15.173 --> 20:17.925
Oh, so I'm a girl like a days

20:15.173 --> 20:17.925
for a few screams. Wait.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.136
(girl scream)

20:23.014 --> 20:24.473
you guys want to get lunch?

20:24.515 --> 20:25.558
Yeah.

20:24.515 --> 20:25.558
What?

20:30.396 --> 20:32.481
And because

20:30.396 --> 20:32.481
the New Hampshirian soldiers

20:32.523 --> 20:33.983
were better equipped,

20:34.025 --> 20:36.027
the Vermont Army

20:34.025 --> 20:36.027
finally surrendered

20:36.069 --> 20:38.612
and fled

20:36.069 --> 20:38.612
the coconut plantations.

20:39.279 --> 20:40.781
Coconuts in Vermont?

20:41.532 --> 20:42.992
I drew a picture of me.

20:45.203 --> 20:46.286
(bell rings)

20:46.328 --> 20:47.663
Okay, everyone, get out.

20:47.705 --> 20:48.956
Out.

20:51.542 --> 20:52.668
Henry, may I see you?

20:52.710 --> 20:53.794
Yeah, sure.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.256
What's up?

20:57.297 --> 20:57.924
Your grade.

20:58.716 --> 21:00.760
100 I makeup test on my got?

21:02.511 --> 21:03.721
I mean...

21:03.763 --> 21:06.473
I got 100 on my makeup test?

21:06.515 --> 21:08.308
You answered

21:06.515 --> 21:08.308
every question perfectly.

21:08.350 --> 21:09.852
Awesome.

21:09.894 --> 21:11.645
(girl scream)

21:13.147 --> 21:14.607
That was inappropriate.

21:15.691 --> 21:17.110
I just got excited.

21:17.693 --> 21:19.195
I'm proud of you, Henry.

21:19.237 --> 21:21.155
I'd give you a hug

21:19.237 --> 21:21.155
if it wouldn't get me fired.

21:22.698 --> 21:24.158
Thanks.

21:22.698 --> 21:24.158
Have a good weekend.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.367
Too you.

21:26.744 --> 21:27.912
100.

21:27.954 --> 21:30.164
Yeah, baby.

21:27.954 --> 21:30.164
Wh, wh, wh, wait.

21:30.206 --> 21:31.124
What?

21:31.165 --> 21:32.666
Where were you yesterday?

21:32.708 --> 21:34.085
You weren't in class.

21:34.127 --> 21:35.628
I go to had somewhere.

21:37.337 --> 21:38.589
One more time?

21:39.423 --> 21:40.883
I had...

21:40.925 --> 21:43.761
to go somewhere.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.222
Nailed it.

21:48.057 --> 21:49.642
(girl scream)

21:51.894 --> 21:53.104
You later see.

21:56.941 --> 21:58.985
(girl scream)

22:09.203 --> 22:12.581
♪♪

22:32.518 --> 22:34.145
(oven bell)

22:34.187 --> 22:35.271
Mmm...
