00:22.305 --> 00:25.106
There is only one way
I know of to resolve that.

00:25.141 --> 00:26.908
- You can't win.
- I don't care.

00:26.943 --> 00:30.011
<i>They took my home. I can't
walk away from that.</i>

<i>FLINT: It would've

00:40.290 --> 00:42.490
<i>to defeating British forces in Nassau.</i>

00:42.525 --> 00:44.324
If we cannot retrieve that cache,

00:44.360 --> 00:46.527
then the dread fleet in Havana sets sail

00:46.562 --> 00:48.662
to raze all of Nassau to the ground.

00:48.698 --> 00:50.998
I will deny him the cache,
and in doing so,

00:51.033 --> 00:55.102
I will ensure that whatever Nassau is
come Christmas, English will be not it.

I am alone,

03:09.000 --> 03:11.299
as I promised I would be.

03:13.470 --> 03:16.471
The night you left, at the cave,

03:16.507 --> 03:19.774
you said Jack's been arrested.

03:19.809 --> 03:21.910
What the fuck's going on?

03:21.945 --> 03:24.279
Spanish intelligence.

03:24.314 --> 03:26.948
They learned of the cache.

03:26.983 --> 03:31.252
They demanded the governor
recover it and return it.

03:31.287 --> 03:36.090
And they made clear failure to do so
will result in the end of Nassau.

03:36.125 --> 03:38.793
The governor is a reasonable man.

03:38.828 --> 03:42.764
He is a compassionate man,
but he needs that cache.

03:42.799 --> 03:44.932
Fuck what he needs.

03:44.967 --> 03:46.367
Jack don't want it turned over.

03:46.402 --> 03:48.202
If he did, he'd be the one
asking me to do it.

03:48.237 --> 03:49.836
They are hurting him, Anne.

03:51.640 --> 03:54.108
- What?
- You were right.

03:54.143 --> 03:56.444
He is defiant.

03:56.479 --> 04:00.381
So they are trying to coerce
him into cooperating,

04:00.416 --> 04:03.083
into asking you to cooperate.

04:04.553 --> 04:09.289
He refuses, so I am
asking on his behalf.

04:10.759 --> 04:13.994
Fuck you.

04:15.263 --> 04:18.231
I understand what you are going through.

04:18.266 --> 04:20.800
Please understand
I am here for his sake.

04:20.834 --> 04:25.871
<i>Surrender the cache and I will
see to it that Jack goes free.</i>

04:25.907 --> 04:27.840

04:34.849 --> 04:37.483
<i>MAX: She is going to do it.</i>

04:37.518 --> 04:39.852
She agreed to make the exchange?

04:39.887 --> 04:42.722
- She said that?
- No.

04:42.757 --> 04:45.357
But neither can she bear
the idea of Jack's torture.

04:48.630 --> 04:50.996
She will resist awhile.

04:51.031 --> 04:53.732
It will tear her to pieces.

04:53.767 --> 04:55.834
But sooner than later,
she will acquiesce.

04:55.869 --> 04:58.203
How can you know this for certain?

05:00.441 --> 05:02.374
<i>ELEANOR: She knows.</i>

05:04.211 --> 05:06.077
She knows.

05:09.116 --> 05:12.450
<i>[birds chirping]</i>

05:12.485 --> 05:15.253
Jack Rackham? Who is Jack Rackham?

05:15.288 --> 05:18.857
At the moment, he's the most
wanted man in the West Indies,

05:18.892 --> 05:21.760
owing to a cache of rare
jewels in his possession,

05:21.795 --> 05:24.094
proceeds from a massive Spanish prize

05:24.130 --> 05:26.397
and, as luck would have it,

05:26.432 --> 05:31.068
our only hope of victory against
Rogers's regime in Nassau.

05:31.103 --> 05:33.871
You left here to secure a fleet of ships

05:33.906 --> 05:38.543
so that we might harass Nassau's
trade and bleed away her strength.

05:38.578 --> 05:40.577
<i>You told me that without those ships,</i>

05:40.612 --> 05:44.281
you could see no other way to
achieve victory in this fight.

05:44.316 --> 05:47.818
Now you have returned
with nothing but him

05:47.853 --> 05:50.120
and a plan to make up
the difference with money?

05:50.156 --> 05:53.057
Not money, bait.

05:54.126 --> 05:55.959
I came upon a trove of information

05:55.995 --> 05:57.927
belonging to Spanish intelligence.

05:57.962 --> 06:00.930
In it was mention of this cache of gems,

06:00.965 --> 06:03.900
<i>cache I know to be in Jack's possession.</i>

06:03.935 --> 06:06.403
Spain is furious
over its very existence.

06:06.438 --> 06:08.405
<i>They see it as an affront.</i>

06:08.440 --> 06:11.140
They are so furious, in fact,

06:11.176 --> 06:15.277
they are willing to burn Nassau to
the ground just to prove the point.

06:15.313 --> 06:17.479
<i>The only way Rogers can prevent this</i>

06:17.515 --> 06:20.249
is to find the cache and return it.

06:20.284 --> 06:23.452
Which means if we were to find it first,

06:23.487 --> 06:26.322
we could dictate what happens next.

06:26.357 --> 06:28.591
And what are you
proposing that might be?

06:28.626 --> 06:32.428
Rogers's strength resides
in his naval consort...

06:32.463 --> 06:36.332
ships and soldiers on loan
to him from the Crown.

06:36.367 --> 06:38.300
They're well-trained and well-armed.

06:38.336 --> 06:41.270
Against them on even terms, we
wouldn't have a prayer of success,

06:41.305 --> 06:45.641
but if we can get them
to meet us on uneven terms,

06:45.676 --> 06:48.276
terms that dramatically
favor our efforts,

06:48.311 --> 06:49.377
things might be different.

06:49.412 --> 06:52.881
Use the cache to lure him
to committing his forces

06:52.916 --> 06:55.283
onto an undesirable battlefield.

06:55.318 --> 06:57.485
Committing all of his forces there.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.487
<i>With the stakes this high,</i>
<i>he'll have no choice</i>

06:59.522 --> 07:02.790
<i>but to put everything</i>
<i>at his disposal in play.</i>

07:02.825 --> 07:06.394
We compel him into a
single, decisive fight,

07:06.429 --> 07:07.895
<i>one in which we have a massive advantage</i>

07:07.930 --> 07:10.565
and one in which, with a little luck,

07:10.600 --> 07:12.967
we might deal him a catastrophic defeat,

07:13.002 --> 07:14.969
break the back of his military strength,

07:15.004 --> 07:18.406
and open up Nassau
for a direct invasion.

07:18.441 --> 07:22.877
What battlefield is this that will
allow us to defeat that kind of force?

07:22.912 --> 07:25.212
Here.

07:25.248 --> 07:26.881
Here?

07:26.916 --> 07:29.116
Your plan is to lure
the British navy here?

07:32.688 --> 07:36.222
I'd like to speak
with the captain alone.

07:36.258 --> 07:37.491
Now.

07:46.769 --> 07:48.502
How many men?

07:48.537 --> 07:52.238
We imagine Rogers has 500
regulars at his disposal.

07:52.274 --> 07:55.275
What about militia?
Conscripts? The total force?

07:55.310 --> 07:58.011
Twice that, thereabouts.

07:58.046 --> 07:59.512
And what plans for their ships?

07:59.547 --> 08:01.214
<i>Without means to engage them,</i>

08:01.249 --> 08:05.084
their heavy guns would repel any
attempt to defend the beach.

08:05.120 --> 08:06.719
Surely there can be no victory

08:06.754 --> 08:08.288
if you cannot harass their landing.

08:08.323 --> 08:10.189
<i>How do you propose to account for that?</i>

08:10.224 --> 08:11.424
I don't know yet.

08:11.459 --> 08:13.559
And let's say somehow you're able

08:13.594 --> 08:16.061
to eliminate some of their
numbers on the beach.

08:16.096 --> 08:18.230
We have neither the
manpower nor the ammunition

08:18.265 --> 08:20.966
to fight the kind of
battle you're suggesting,

08:21.001 --> 08:23.369
even with the terrain in our favor.

08:23.404 --> 08:24.903
How do you propose to gain these things

08:24.939 --> 08:26.371
on the schedule you're suggesting?

08:26.406 --> 08:28.040
I don't know yet.

08:28.075 --> 08:30.275
I'm not going out there
with "I don't know yet."

08:32.412 --> 08:35.547
These people know their
lives are about to change.

08:35.582 --> 08:37.749
They know they'll need
to fight to survive,

08:37.784 --> 08:39.417
but I will not go before them

08:39.453 --> 08:42.386
and argue to have that fight all at once

08:42.422 --> 08:45.890
and risk losing everything all at once

08:45.925 --> 08:48.926
unless I am certain
that fight can be won.

08:50.129 --> 08:53.565
Am I certain that we will prevail?

08:53.600 --> 08:55.933
No.

08:55.969 --> 08:58.502
But the odds will never
be better than they are

08:58.537 --> 09:01.939
right now, in this moment.

09:01.975 --> 09:04.108
Of that, I am most certain.

09:10.783 --> 09:12.884
[sighs]

09:15.855 --> 09:18.922
To find Jack Rackham, you'll
need to go to Nassau, yes?

09:20.058 --> 09:21.825
We assume that he's long gone by now,

09:21.861 --> 09:24.628
but Nassau is where we will
pick up his trail, yes.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.833
There are other things you will
need to secure while you're there.

09:29.869 --> 09:33.436
My husband supplied us
with weapons and shot

09:33.471 --> 09:36.506
to arm ourselves
and to defend this camp.

09:36.541 --> 09:39.309
He also maintained a stockpile on Nassau

09:39.344 --> 09:42.312
in preparation for a day such as this.

09:42.347 --> 09:45.815
As far as we know, it is still
there, guarded by his agents.

09:45.850 --> 09:48.718
Tell me where to find them
and I'll retrieve it.

09:48.753 --> 09:50.319
They will not trust you

09:50.354 --> 09:52.988
<i>nor even acknowledge</i>
<i>the existence of this place</i>

09:53.024 --> 09:55.491
<i>to anyone other than my husband,</i>

09:55.527 --> 09:57.660
<i>and he's too weak to leave our care.</i>

10:00.197 --> 10:02.665
<i>So we will have to send</i>
<i>the next best thing.</i>

10:05.669 --> 10:08.703
<i>She will help you get what you need,</i>

10:08.739 --> 10:11.573
<i>but one more thing.</i>

10:11.608 --> 10:14.076
<i>I know your way is to invest a captain</i>

10:14.111 --> 10:16.979
<i>with unquestioned authority</i>
<i>while in battle,</i>

10:17.014 --> 10:21.215
<i>but this battle is ours</i>
<i>as much as yours.</i>

10:21.251 --> 10:24.986
<i>My word and your word will
govern in concert or not at all.</i>

10:27.424 --> 10:31.960
<i>And when I'm not present, that word
shall be given by my daughter.</i>

Touch of the grippe is all, sir.

10:49.779 --> 10:51.145
I'll be all right.

10:51.181 --> 10:55.182
You're the third man to say as
much to me in the last four hours.

10:56.719 --> 10:58.051
I'll see you relieved.

10:58.087 --> 11:00.454
Please report to Dr. Marcus immediately.

Yes, sir.

this unfortunate arrangement
between you and I.

11:28.683 --> 11:31.551
- What?
- <i>Contact was made with Anne Bonny.</i>

11:31.586 --> 11:33.653
The situation was explained to her

11:33.688 --> 11:35.454
that the sooner she returns the cache,

11:35.490 --> 11:37.390
the better it would be for you.

11:38.927 --> 11:43.396
She was disturbed but, we
believe, ultimately persuaded.

11:43.431 --> 11:44.763
Disturbed?

11:49.437 --> 11:51.404
You told her I was being tortured.

11:51.439 --> 11:54.973
If the street would hear
you were being mistreated,

11:55.009 --> 11:56.742
if they were to see you
emerge from this place

11:56.777 --> 11:59.245
damaged or not at all,
I'd risk losing them.

11:59.280 --> 12:00.612
I know this.

12:00.648 --> 12:03.015
<i>I imagine you were counting on it,</i>

12:03.050 --> 12:06.084
the notion that all you had
left me were bad options

12:06.119 --> 12:08.820
guaranteed, ultimately,
to serve your ends.

12:08.856 --> 12:12.791
This way, no one hears it but her.

12:12.826 --> 12:14.860
I get what I need,

12:14.895 --> 12:16.694
the island survives,

12:16.729 --> 12:19.464
and no one is harmed.

12:19.499 --> 12:23.368
I face a number of dangers
ahead in stabilizing Nassau.

12:23.403 --> 12:25.703
The one I will resist
to the limits of my ability

12:25.738 --> 12:29.807
is to allow myself
to be cast as its villain.

12:29.842 --> 12:32.677
<i>When the cache is delivered, you'll
both be free to do as you please.</i>

12:39.052 --> 12:40.651
Do you have a wife?

12:44.591 --> 12:45.890
Beg pardon?

12:45.925 --> 12:48.125
Do you have a wife?

12:50.162 --> 12:51.962
I do.

12:53.099 --> 12:55.132
How do you imagine she would feel

12:55.167 --> 12:56.700
if she were told you were suffering

12:56.735 --> 12:59.869
some awful, degrading abuse

12:59.905 --> 13:01.505
and that the only way she could end it

13:01.540 --> 13:03.907
would be to betray your trust?

13:03.942 --> 13:06.710
How do you think she would
feel if she betrayed you,

13:06.745 --> 13:09.412
knowing she likely lost
that trust forever,

13:09.447 --> 13:12.448
and then learned the whole
thing was based on a ruse?

13:14.452 --> 13:16.853
And no one was harmed.

13:19.591 --> 13:21.858
We're all villains in Nassau.

13:21.893 --> 13:25.161
Don't think because you're
new you're any different.

[quietly] The exchange
is to take place tomorrow.

13:46.884 --> 13:50.953
Captain Rackham will be set
free in exchange for the cache.

13:50.988 --> 13:54.857
Once that happens and the
cache is shipped to Havana,

13:54.892 --> 13:56.791
the entirety of the Urca
de Lima's prize gold

13:56.826 --> 13:58.560
will be in Spain's possession.

13:58.595 --> 14:01.363
Captain Rackham...

14:01.398 --> 14:02.730
he's in the governor's custody.

14:05.435 --> 14:07.269
You never mentioned this.

14:07.304 --> 14:09.271
- I'm sorry, I...
- It's all right.

14:12.275 --> 14:13.941
[sighs]

14:15.645 --> 14:18.046
I've given thought to our
previous conversation.

14:19.849 --> 14:21.916
I'm not without sympathy
for your situation.

14:21.951 --> 14:24.118
I have no desire
to see harm come to you.

14:25.454 --> 14:27.588
If the governor returns
all of the Urca gold,

14:27.623 --> 14:31.024
my superiors have promised not to set
loose the fleet upon this place.

14:34.297 --> 14:37.064
And my superiors are proud men,

14:37.099 --> 14:38.599
and they're angry.

14:41.270 --> 14:42.936
Were I you...

14:44.173 --> 14:47.240
I might encourage Governor Rogers

14:47.275 --> 14:51.411
not just to send the gold,
but to send something more.

14:51.446 --> 14:55.448
<i>An offering to demonstrate</i>
<i>good faith and friendship.</i>

14:55.483 --> 14:59.619
<i>Not just the stolen gold,</i>
<i>but the man responsible</i>

14:59.654 --> 15:01.254
<i>for stealing it in the first place.</i>

15:01.289 --> 15:02.922
<i>[door opens]</i>

15:02.957 --> 15:05.124
<i>And tell him that we asked for
his return, if you'd like.</i>

15:05.159 --> 15:07.660
<i>No one will ever know.</i>

15:07.696 --> 15:11.764
<i>But Nassau's safety</i>
<i>and yours is best served</i>

15:11.799 --> 15:14.066
<i>if, when the gold</i>
<i>is surrendered in Havana...</i>

15:15.670 --> 15:17.670
<i>it's accompanied by Mr. Rackham.</i>

15:21.042 --> 15:24.276
I swore to Anne that these
terms would be honored.

15:24.311 --> 15:26.846
Surrender the cache and Jack goes free.

15:26.881 --> 15:29.381
- I gave her my word.
<i>- ELEANOR: I know.</i>

15:29.416 --> 15:32.451
<i>They changed the rules</i>
<i>so very late in the game.</i>

15:32.486 --> 15:34.819
We could resist, but we have
nothing to bargain with.

15:36.056 --> 15:37.389
Were there anything I could do,

15:37.424 --> 15:38.557
were there anything
the governor could do,

15:38.592 --> 15:40.459
I assure you, it would be done.

15:40.494 --> 15:42.294
<i>But either Jack is
surrendered with the gold</i>

15:42.329 --> 15:44.028
<i>or Nassau burns.</i>

15:44.064 --> 15:46.064
<i>- [knock on door]</i>
- Yes?

15:46.099 --> 15:49.601
[door opens] A few things
that require your approval.

15:52.505 --> 15:54.672
- Is everything all right?
- Yes, what is it?

15:56.576 --> 15:59.978
My apologies. Nothing that can't wait.

16:00.013 --> 16:01.880
I beg your pardon.

16:28.774 --> 16:30.573
When the governor's men
arrive at the transaction

16:30.609 --> 16:33.210
without Jack and Anne sees this,

16:33.245 --> 16:35.412
she will resist.

16:35.447 --> 16:38.115
I would humbly ask that the
governor's men refrain...

16:38.150 --> 16:42.084
They have been forbidden
from firing first.

16:42.120 --> 16:45.888
They've been forbidden
from provoking her.

16:45.924 --> 16:48.391
They've been forbidden from using
any violence against her at all

16:48.427 --> 16:51.761
unless in dire and
unavoidable self-defense.

16:52.831 --> 16:54.263
Why?

16:55.434 --> 16:56.933
Because I demanded it.

16:59.270 --> 17:01.737
Out of respect for your partnership.

17:10.114 --> 17:12.048
I do not know which is worse...

17:14.452 --> 17:16.819
that she perish fighting for Jack...

17:16.854 --> 17:18.487
[wine pouring]

17:18.521 --> 17:21.757
...or that she survive without him.

17:21.791 --> 17:24.626
If it is even truly surviving,

17:24.662 --> 17:27.363
losing half of herself this way.

17:46.516 --> 17:48.750
<i>- [fiddle playing]</i>
<i>- [chatter]</i>

17:48.785 --> 17:51.051
Is she still in there?

17:53.656 --> 17:56.457
Eleanor Guthrie, is she
still in there with Max?

17:56.493 --> 17:58.359
Yeah.

17:58.395 --> 18:00.795
The fuck's your problem?

18:01.865 --> 18:03.964
I thought I heard them
say something about...

18:05.634 --> 18:07.134
Something about what?

18:09.838 --> 18:12.606
Nothing. Never mind.

18:13.742 --> 18:16.576
[chatter and music continue]

18:21.917 --> 18:24.785
<i>FLINT: We should be sighting the
island in just a few hours' time.</i>

18:24.820 --> 18:29.556
We'll approach just west of Nassau
Town under cover of darkness.

18:29.591 --> 18:34.060
Two longboats will ferry
the landing party to shore.

18:34.095 --> 18:38.364
You'll slip into town to pick up the
trail to find Rackham and Bonny.

18:38.400 --> 18:41.467
The sooner we know where to go
to find the cache, the better.

18:41.502 --> 18:44.537
You'll join our party
towards the tavern,

18:44.572 --> 18:47.173
make contact with
your father's agent there

18:47.208 --> 18:49.575
and arrange for the
acquisition of guns and shot.

18:49.610 --> 18:50.876
She'll not enter the tavern.

18:50.912 --> 18:52.678
She won't enter the tavern.

18:52.713 --> 18:54.413
She'll have an escort of your choosing.

18:54.449 --> 18:56.916
She'll be back on the water
before anyone knows she's there.

18:56.951 --> 19:01.186
<i>Meanwhile, Billy and I will enter
the tavern and begin recruiting.</i>

19:01.221 --> 19:03.388
Still don't understand how you
think that's going to help us.

19:03.424 --> 19:06.625
- Recruiting more men?
- Recruiting <i> those</i> men.

19:07.762 --> 19:10.228
Any man still left on that island

19:10.264 --> 19:11.896
made a choice to desert the black.

19:11.932 --> 19:14.899
Even if they do join us,

19:14.935 --> 19:18.270
what makes you think they won't
just desert us all over again

19:18.305 --> 19:20.272
the moment the fight begins?

19:20.307 --> 19:23.208
It's about more than the men we win.

19:23.243 --> 19:26.177
It's the message we send
to those we don't.

19:26.212 --> 19:29.213
If they won't take up arms
and fight alongside us,

19:29.248 --> 19:32.917
I want them terrified of the
thought of doing it against us.

19:32.953 --> 19:35.019
BILLY: Well, then, it shouldn't be you.

19:35.054 --> 19:36.554
If you want them to fear you,

19:36.590 --> 19:38.189
it shouldn't be you
delivering the message.

19:38.224 --> 19:40.391
You're returning from the dead.

19:40.426 --> 19:42.559
But no ghost story I've ever heard of

19:42.595 --> 19:45.629
begins with the ghost
introducing himself.

19:45.664 --> 19:49.400
I mean, you walk in there and
insist on your own fearsomeness

19:49.435 --> 19:52.536
sort of threatens
to do more damage than good.

19:52.571 --> 19:55.572
The message I understand, but I think
someone else needs to deliver it.

19:55.608 --> 19:57.608
Someone?

19:57.643 --> 19:58.909
Who?

20:00.913 --> 20:02.946
Him.

20:02.982 --> 20:06.149
I can think of no one more effective
at capturing men's minds.

20:06.184 --> 20:08.986
And, maybe just as importantly,

20:09.021 --> 20:11.822
given the need to invest the moment
with as much impact as possible...

20:11.857 --> 20:15.225
Who'll be able to take their eyes
off the one-legged creature?

20:18.263 --> 20:20.096
[chuckles]

20:21.366 --> 20:23.166
<i>[knock on door]</i>

20:23.201 --> 20:26.202
Land on the horizon.
Shall we make our approach?

20:29.841 --> 20:31.674
Do it.

20:31.709 --> 20:34.076
And make ready the launches.

20:34.111 --> 20:36.646
I'll lead the shore party
as soon as we arrive.

20:39.017 --> 20:41.417
<i>[door closes]</i>

20:41.452 --> 20:44.453
<i>[distant chatter]</i>

20:50.061 --> 20:52.061
That fucking chair.

20:53.464 --> 20:56.532
To gain it, it demands you win partners,

20:56.567 --> 21:00.369
call them friends,

21:00.404 --> 21:03.205
make them promises.

21:03.240 --> 21:07.208
To keep it, it demands
you break them all.

21:07.243 --> 21:08.843
One day when all is settled here,

21:08.879 --> 21:11.479
we should burn that fucking chair.

21:17.054 --> 21:19.688
My God, how I hated you.

21:22.425 --> 21:24.725
There was a time in which
I could not conceive

21:24.760 --> 21:26.827
of how I could ever forgive you.

21:29.665 --> 21:31.832
And in this moment, I am you.

21:35.205 --> 21:36.870
I think my footing in this moment

21:36.906 --> 21:39.106
is far more precarious than yours.

21:40.109 --> 21:43.410
That is not what I hear.

21:43.445 --> 21:45.879
What does that mean?

21:47.883 --> 21:49.717
Once pirates visited the inn

21:49.752 --> 21:52.820
and I heard what pirates said.

21:52.855 --> 21:54.554
Now that soldiers visit the inn...

21:54.590 --> 21:57.557
You hear what soldiers say.

21:57.593 --> 21:59.058
[chuckles softly]

21:59.094 --> 22:00.960
And what is it they're saying about me?

22:04.032 --> 22:07.100
They say you are inseparable.

22:07.136 --> 22:10.069
<i>They say he relies upon you</i>
<i>more than any other.</i>

22:13.108 --> 22:15.241
They sometimes say more.

22:17.478 --> 22:20.880
<i>Did you know his men speak this way?</i>

22:20.915 --> 22:22.715
No.

22:22.751 --> 22:25.084
<i>It is only gossip for now,</i>

22:25.120 --> 22:28.687
<i>but sooner or later, it will affect him.</i>

22:28.722 --> 22:31.257
<i>Erode his support.</i>

22:31.292 --> 22:34.860
<i>Complicate the role he must play here.</i>

22:34.895 --> 22:36.762
<i>The governor's chair is no doubt</i>

22:36.797 --> 22:38.730
<i>as unforgiving as mine.</i>

22:38.766 --> 22:41.900
<i>It will demand the same
kind of sacrifices</i>

22:41.935 --> 22:45.737
<i>and present the same sorts of
dangers to those closest to him.</i>

22:45.773 --> 22:49.975
You must know this as well.

22:50.010 --> 22:53.879
<i>I will not insult you by offering you
warnings of the dangers therein.</i>

22:53.914 --> 22:56.548
<i>But out of respect for our partnership,</i>

22:56.583 --> 23:00.218
<i>I thought you should know</i>
<i>what is being said</i>

23:00.253 --> 23:03.821
<i>and also how near those
dangers may very well be.</i>

23:03.856 --> 23:06.257
<i>[crickets chirping]</i>

23:47.466 --> 23:49.933
[breathing heavily]

24:03.148 --> 24:05.148
Mm.

25:12.415 --> 25:14.014
[gasps]

25:19.488 --> 25:22.088
If you don't say something,
I'm going to have to.

25:30.265 --> 25:32.398
Eight of my men have fallen ill.

25:34.970 --> 25:37.871
One of your warehouses has been
converted into a sick bay.

25:41.343 --> 25:44.077
If we had been honest with
ourselves, we'd have seen it coming.

25:45.814 --> 25:48.381
Where chapter one is
"Conquest of a Foreign Land,"

25:48.416 --> 25:52.084
chapter two is always "Suffer the Illness
to Which the Natives Are Immune."

25:55.089 --> 25:57.256
Those eight men won't be the last.

25:59.093 --> 26:01.260
Many of my people will die.

26:04.031 --> 26:06.565
Every man and woman that
followed me onto this island

26:06.600 --> 26:08.300
will be susceptible to it.

26:11.105 --> 26:14.773
Yet as I lay here, the three words

26:14.808 --> 26:17.576
I keep hearing in my mind
over and over again are...

26:19.112 --> 26:21.112
"except for her."

26:30.991 --> 26:32.991
You're one of them.

26:34.862 --> 26:37.828
Whether I choose
to acknowledge it or not,

26:37.864 --> 26:40.198
nature is going to keep
reminding me of this fact

26:40.233 --> 26:43.467
in the coming days
with every death we suffer.

26:45.238 --> 26:47.238
You think I'm a danger to you?

26:50.977 --> 26:53.277
I know I can feel my
connection to London diminish

26:53.312 --> 26:56.213
with every day I'm here.

26:56.248 --> 26:59.316
I can only assume your connection to
this place is growing at a similar rate

26:59.351 --> 27:01.452
and that sooner or later

27:01.487 --> 27:05.456
the instincts that led you into the
prison cell I found you in will return.

27:09.094 --> 27:11.694
[sighs]

27:18.103 --> 27:21.504
You asked me once if it was
true what my enemies say of me.

27:23.342 --> 27:25.675
That I would turn on anyone,
no matter how close,

27:25.710 --> 27:27.676
if it served my ambition.

27:32.050 --> 27:34.116
It was that way once.

27:37.555 --> 27:39.822
But I do not wish
to be that way ever again.

27:42.793 --> 27:44.960
I'm resolved to shed it.

27:47.230 --> 27:50.065
I'm resolved to have
my word mean something.

27:58.876 --> 28:00.675
And I give you my word...

28:03.913 --> 28:06.581
my commitment to you is inviolable.

28:09.619 --> 28:13.554
Not because my freedom
depends on your success here.

28:13.590 --> 28:15.690
Not because I seek to regain
that which was taken from me

28:15.725 --> 28:18.759
nor vengeance upon those who took it.

28:21.430 --> 28:23.397
Then why?

28:47.923 --> 28:49.923
<i>[men chattering]</i>

28:54.262 --> 28:55.962
[gasps]

29:00.301 --> 29:02.101
Shh.

29:03.304 --> 29:05.271
They're handing him over to the Spanish?

29:05.306 --> 29:07.306
Max made mention of an exchange

29:07.342 --> 29:09.608
between the governor's
men and Anne Bonny.

29:09.644 --> 29:11.644
I think Anne believes she's handing over

29:11.679 --> 29:15.181
her share of the Urca prize money
in exchange for Jack's release.

29:15.216 --> 29:17.517
- But by the time... 
- By the time Anne realizes they lied to her,

29:17.552 --> 29:20.186
it'll be too late
to do anything about it.

29:20.221 --> 29:23.255
You know this and here
you are doing nothing.

29:23.290 --> 29:24.924
What would you have me do?

29:24.959 --> 29:26.759
Even if I could tell anyone,

29:26.794 --> 29:29.094
how the fuck is their response not,

29:29.129 --> 29:32.031
"Hand over Jack or Nassau burns.

29:32.066 --> 29:33.632
This is a dilemma for us how?"

29:35.069 --> 29:37.202
Then help me.

29:37.237 --> 29:40.505
Help me find out where that
exchange is going to be

29:40.541 --> 29:42.674
so I can stop it.

29:44.545 --> 29:45.810
You want to use Max's girls

29:45.845 --> 29:47.512
to inform on the governor's operation

29:47.548 --> 29:49.647
without telling Max?

29:49.683 --> 29:53.118
Major Andrews is part of the
governor's inner circle

29:53.153 --> 29:55.320
and he's been at this inn
every day for weeks.

29:55.355 --> 29:59.757
The right girl could get enough out
of him to piece the rest together.

30:01.394 --> 30:04.696
When you took that pardon, you
said you wanted a new start.

30:04.731 --> 30:07.398
Chance of a stabler life.

30:07.433 --> 30:10.334
Now all of a sudden, you're ready
to fall in with Charles Vane,

30:10.369 --> 30:13.237
conspire against the fucking governor.

30:13.272 --> 30:15.872
If I'm wrong about this,
then no one need know

30:15.908 --> 30:17.841
you ever made the inquiry.

30:17.876 --> 30:19.643
And we'll all sleep
a little more soundly

30:19.678 --> 30:23.180
knowing our governor isn't quite
the shit I'm afraid he might be.

30:23.216 --> 30:25.349
But if I'm right,

30:25.384 --> 30:28.219
then you and I and a lot of
people are being lied to

30:28.254 --> 30:31.822
about a thing no one ought
to be lied to about.

30:31.857 --> 30:34.625
And this may be our only
chance to find out for sure.

30:37.362 --> 30:40.163
<i>-[distant laughter, -chatter]</i>

31:19.069 --> 31:21.603
Your name is Eme.

31:21.639 --> 31:23.238
You're an agent of my father's.

31:23.274 --> 31:26.375
You've worked with him here in secret

31:26.410 --> 31:27.909
to supply our camp.

31:28.945 --> 31:30.412
My name is Madi.

31:32.583 --> 31:35.483
Where is your father?

31:35.518 --> 31:37.552
- No one has seen him...
- He's fine.

31:42.258 --> 31:43.591
He's dying...

31:43.626 --> 31:46.094
with us at home.

31:48.131 --> 31:50.298
I'm so very sorry.

31:50.333 --> 31:52.066
He has asked a favor.

to send a handful of men

with Lord Hamilton and Peter Ashe
to introduce the pardon to Nassau.

48:50.287 --> 48:53.453
As with most things,
the men first into the breach

48:53.489 --> 48:56.157
bear the heaviest casualties.

48:56.192 --> 48:57.257
But in the hindsight of victory,

48:57.293 --> 49:01.328
they were the ones whose
sacrifice made it possible.

49:01.363 --> 49:06.133
Without Lord Hamilton's
efforts, your efforts,

49:06.169 --> 49:08.335
it's likely I wouldn't have
been successful in my efforts

49:08.370 --> 49:11.672
to finally secure the pardon.

49:11.707 --> 49:14.341
All I have done here

49:14.376 --> 49:18.144
is finish what you began.

49:18.180 --> 49:21.648
I am now what you were then.

49:21.684 --> 49:25.484
And without you, there would be no me.

49:27.823 --> 49:29.488
Clever.

49:31.059 --> 49:33.426
Thank you.

49:33.461 --> 49:35.028
So that's what this is.

49:35.063 --> 49:38.598
We're all reasonable men,
we all want the same thing.

49:38.633 --> 49:41.934
You offer me a pardon,
I accept it, this all ends?

49:41.969 --> 49:43.636
Maybe.

49:45.306 --> 49:48.107
The pardons are on the table.

49:48.142 --> 49:50.175
No one is being hanged.

49:50.211 --> 49:52.678
No one's even being tried.

49:52.714 --> 49:56.349
They've all been forgiven,
just as you wanted.

49:56.384 --> 49:58.984
Just as Thomas Hamilton wanted.

50:01.688 --> 50:03.055
So what is it that you're fighting for

50:03.090 --> 50:04.957
that I'm not already offering?

50:06.827 --> 50:11.630
Thomas Hamilton fought
to introduce the pardons

50:11.665 --> 50:13.265
to make a point.

50:14.701 --> 50:16.768
To seek to change England.

50:19.105 --> 50:21.906
And he was killed for it.

50:21.941 --> 50:26.711
His wife and I went to Charles
Town to argue for the pardons,

50:26.747 --> 50:31.382
to make peace with England,
and she was killed for it.

50:34.888 --> 50:36.988
England has shown herself to me.

50:38.524 --> 50:41.692
Gnarled and gray...

50:43.129 --> 50:48.732
and spiteful of anyone who would
find happiness under her rule.

50:49.769 --> 50:52.736
I'm through seeking
anything from England

50:52.772 --> 50:56.239
except her departure from my island.

50:56.275 --> 50:58.575
It was England's island first.

51:00.913 --> 51:03.013
I don't imagine she's
going to let it go easily.

51:03.048 --> 51:05.182
I don't imagine she would.

51:05.217 --> 51:06.449
I see.

51:06.484 --> 51:08.418
So there we are, then.

51:08.453 --> 51:09.853
There we are, then.

51:12.157 --> 51:14.257
What a story you'll have
to spin to your men

51:14.293 --> 51:17.393
to turn me into the kind of villain
worth losing their lives over.

51:17.429 --> 51:19.862
I've lived on the other
side of those stories.

51:19.897 --> 51:23.366
I'm sure I'll figure something out.

51:23.401 --> 51:25.535
I'm sure you will.

51:28.973 --> 51:31.907
Then let us be very
clear about something.

51:31.943 --> 51:35.745
I am reasonable in seeking peace.

51:37.748 --> 51:41.317
But if you insist upon
making me your villain,

51:41.352 --> 51:43.953
I'll play the part.

51:43.988 --> 51:46.922
<i>So let us assume that,</i>
<i>as of this moment,</i>

51:46.958 --> 51:50.092
<i>the unqualified pardon is no more.</i>

51:50.127 --> 51:52.294
From this moment on,

51:52.330 --> 51:56.498
any man participating in the
act of high seas piracy

51:56.533 --> 51:58.400
will be presumed to be one of your men,

51:58.435 --> 52:01.570
<i>an enemy of the state.</i>

52:01.605 --> 52:06.608
I will hunt him, I will catch
him, and I will hang him.

52:09.045 --> 52:13.982
And while I am aware of your
feelings on the subject,

52:14.017 --> 52:18.920
I am no backwater magistrate
cowering in fear of you.

52:22.558 --> 52:24.558
You know where to find me.

52:52.487 --> 52:54.288
<i>[chatter]</i>

52:54.323 --> 52:58.991
<i>FEATHERSTONE: Assuming Idelle's
got the location of the meet,</i>

52:59.027 --> 53:01.661
assuming you can get to Anne first...

53:03.832 --> 53:06.466
what are you gonna say to her?

53:06.501 --> 53:07.967
What do you mean?

53:08.002 --> 53:10.169
If she aborts the exchange,

53:10.204 --> 53:13.573
it isn't as though you can just
leave the island that way,

53:13.608 --> 53:15.641
abandoning Jack to his fate.

53:15.676 --> 53:19.211
Of course not. Nor can you exchange
the money for Jack's release.

53:19.247 --> 53:21.914
If they had been willing to do that,

53:21.950 --> 53:24.083
we wouldn't be in this
mess in the first place.

53:24.118 --> 53:26.152
<i>[door opens]</i>

53:34.294 --> 53:36.695
Did you learn where the
exchange is taking place?

53:41.034 --> 53:42.868
[whinnying]

53:58.918 --> 54:00.818
COACHMAN: Whoa, boy.

54:09.228 --> 54:11.462
Jack's in there?

54:11.498 --> 54:14.398
We need to see the chest first.

54:14.433 --> 54:16.300
Step aside, let us take a look.

54:16.335 --> 54:19.470
<i>- Then we'll let him go.</i>
- Fuck that.

54:19.506 --> 54:20.905
I want to see him.

54:20.940 --> 54:24.441
We see the chest first.
Those are our orders.

54:33.852 --> 54:35.519
[horse whickers]

54:36.955 --> 54:38.488
Wait a minute.

54:38.524 --> 54:40.557
What the fuck's going on?

54:49.300 --> 54:51.735
He ain't in there, is he?

54:51.770 --> 54:53.537
- Oi!
- [horse neighs]

55:08.553 --> 55:10.486
<i>COACHMAN: Hup, hup!</i>

55:10.522 --> 55:13.556
<i>- [horse neighs]</i>
<i>- COACHMAN: Hup! Hup!</i>

55:15.026 --> 55:16.458
<i>Hup.</i>

55:40.250 --> 55:42.917
You better be right about this.

55:48.925 --> 55:51.492
<i>FLINT: Why the fuck did
you hand over the chest?</i>

55:51.527 --> 55:53.027
Because had we held it,

55:53.063 --> 55:56.230
right now we'd be in a standoff
with a superior force,

55:56.265 --> 55:58.332
time working against us,

55:58.367 --> 56:00.234
and no way to secure Jack's release.

56:00.269 --> 56:04.638
This way, the governor
has everything he needs

56:04.673 --> 56:07.674
and no reason to suspect
anything is amiss,

56:07.710 --> 56:09.876
leaving him to proceed with his plan.

56:09.912 --> 56:13.013
A plan you think that we can frustrate?

56:13.048 --> 56:16.517
Jack and the cache are to be
moved aboard a secret caravan

56:16.552 --> 56:21.187
to a ship waiting somewhere
off the southern coast.

56:21.223 --> 56:23.490
If we can intercept that caravan,

56:23.525 --> 56:26.727
we can secure both
the money to start our war

56:26.762 --> 56:28.695
and the partner to help us fight it.

56:30.599 --> 56:33.600
Either we get Jack and the cache

56:33.635 --> 56:35.401
or we get nothing.
