00:04.417 --> 00:08.083
Gee, Mick, thanks for
watching over me tonight.

00:08.458 --> 00:10.375
I've been gettin' in
a little trouble lately

00:10.375 --> 00:12.625
on account of my sleepwalkin'.

00:12.625 --> 00:14.417
No problem, pal.

00:15.208 --> 00:18.125
So you sleepwalk. Ha!
How much trouble can it be?

00:20.709 --> 00:23.417
Good night, goofy.

00:36.583 --> 00:38.166
Oh!

00:39.375 --> 00:40.500
Ah!

00:40.875 --> 00:42.542
Goofy? Ooh.

00:52.208 --> 00:53.417
Goofy?

00:59.375 --> 01:00.583
Goofy!

01:07.250 --> 01:08.709
Hey, goofy!

01:08.709 --> 01:10.250
Aw, wake up, buddy.

01:14.250 --> 01:16.458
Goofy! Wake up!

01:28.417 --> 01:29.750
Phew!

01:56.709 --> 01:57.834
Oh, no!

02:14.625 --> 02:15.792
Oh!

02:15.792 --> 02:17.125
Huh?

02:29.917 --> 02:31.792
Huh?

02:48.667 --> 02:50.834
When is this marathon
ever going to finish?

02:50.834 --> 02:52.250
Huh?

02:52.667 --> 02:54.667
Finish? Finish line?

02:54.667 --> 02:56.208
That's it!

03:04.834 --> 03:06.500
Phew!

03:13.875 --> 03:16.709
Wow!
I slept great!

03:16.709 --> 03:18.792
I feel like I can run a marathon!

03:18.792 --> 03:20.792
What do you say, Mick?
Come on.

03:20.792 --> 03:22.583
Not again!

03:24.709 --> 03:27.500
Yeah! That's what
I'm talkin' about!

03:27.500 --> 03:29.208
Now, wait for me.
