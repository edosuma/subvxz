(drill buzzing)

00:04.463 --> 00:06.465
DEWEY:

00:04.463 --> 00:06.465
I hate my brothers.

00:06.507 --> 00:08.049
I only like me.

00:08.091 --> 00:10.135
I hate my brothers.

00:10.177 --> 00:12.095
I only like me.

00:12.137 --> 00:14.055
I hate my brothers.

00:14.097 --> 00:15.265
I only like me.

00:15.307 --> 00:16.851
(boys yelling)

00:16.892 --> 00:18.686
Stop it right now!

00:16.892 --> 00:18.686
I mean it!

00:18.727 --> 00:20.061
(yelling continues)

00:20.103 --> 00:21.647
When are you going to be done?

00:21.689 --> 00:23.273
Soon as I can, honey.

00:23.315 --> 00:25.275
I said, stop it!

00:25.317 --> 00:27.277
DEWEY:

00:25.317 --> 00:27.277
I hate my brothers.

00:27.319 --> 00:29.112
I only like me.

00:29.154 --> 00:31.072
I hate my brothers.

00:31.114 --> 00:33.074
I only like me.

I know a lot of kids

01:17.452 --> 01:19.788
say they like school,

01:19.830 --> 01:22.499
but honestly,

01:19.830 --> 01:22.499
I just find it exhausting.

01:22.541 --> 01:26.837
I mean, when I am in school,

01:22.541 --> 01:26.837
I'm either bored, terrified...

01:28.047 --> 01:29.924
...or confused

01:28.047 --> 01:29.924
about Julie Houlerman.

01:29.965 --> 01:31.550
Hi, Malcolm.

01:31.592 --> 01:32.593
Perfect example.

01:32.634 --> 01:34.135
What does she mean by that?

01:34.177 --> 01:35.387
Is it just "hi"?

01:35.429 --> 01:37.431
Is she trying to say

01:35.429 --> 01:37.431
she likes me?

01:37.472 --> 01:39.140
Is she just being nice?

01:39.182 --> 01:41.393
And now I have to figure out

01:39.182 --> 01:41.393
a secret way to answer her

01:41.435 --> 01:43.144
without A)

01:41.435 --> 01:43.144
acting like I like her,

01:43.186 --> 01:45.064
or B)

01:43.186 --> 01:45.064
acting like I don't like her,

01:45.146 --> 01:48.984
or C) acting like

01:45.146 --> 01:48.984
I've never thought about A or B.

01:49.026 --> 01:51.152
Just be pleasant

01:49.026 --> 01:51.152
but noncommittal.

01:51.194 --> 01:52.112
Hey, Jul...

01:55.198 --> 01:58.118
She's doing this to me

01:55.198 --> 01:58.118
on purpose.

02:01.204 --> 02:02.831
(girls squealing)

02:02.873 --> 02:04.458
Hey, how are you?

02:04.499 --> 02:06.961
(girls laughing)

02:07.002 --> 02:08.587
Stanley, you are incredible.

02:08.629 --> 02:11.799
I thought Malcolm was a genius,

02:08.629 --> 02:11.799
but this is off the charts.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.550
The school asked

02:11.840 --> 02:13.550
for an honor guard.

02:13.592 --> 02:16.177
I figured you'd like a few

02:13.592 --> 02:16.177
weeks without drill practice.

02:16.219 --> 02:17.471
A pageant, though.

02:17.512 --> 02:20.223
Beautiful girls

02:17.512 --> 02:20.223
with self-esteem issues.

02:20.265 --> 02:22.977
It's perfect.

02:23.018 --> 02:26.021
Easy. Let's start with

02:23.018 --> 02:26.021
the obvious runners-up.

02:26.063 --> 02:28.273
They're going to be

02:26.063 --> 02:28.273
the neediest.

02:31.526 --> 02:34.488
You know, uh, this

02:31.526 --> 02:34.488
is a little intense.

02:34.529 --> 02:38.366
You, me, working

02:34.529 --> 02:38.366
this shelf... together.

02:38.408 --> 02:39.785
(chuckles nervously)

02:39.827 --> 02:42.788
What's intense about it?

02:42.830 --> 02:44.205
I guess nothing.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.415
Excuse me.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.210
Mom!

02:49.252 --> 02:51.130
You're not supposed

02:49.252 --> 02:51.130
to yell in the store.

02:51.170 --> 02:53.090
Not supposed

02:51.170 --> 02:53.090
to do that either.

02:53.132 --> 02:54.299
Life's funny that way.

02:54.341 --> 02:58.470
Hey... the Three Musketeers.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.014
Athos, Aramis...

03:00.055 --> 03:02.016
and you must be Porthos.

03:02.057 --> 03:03.517
You're creepy.

03:03.558 --> 03:06.311
You really shouldn't say

03:03.558 --> 03:06.311
hurtful things to grown-ups.

03:06.353 --> 03:07.813
I'm sorry.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.898
That's okay.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.898
We're still friends.

03:09.940 --> 03:11.232
(chuckles)

03:09.940 --> 03:11.232
Craig...

03:11.274 --> 03:12.860
you have got to redo

03:11.274 --> 03:12.860
the nail polish.

03:12.901 --> 03:15.070
The crystal pinks are mixed

03:12.901 --> 03:15.070
with the frosty pinks

03:15.112 --> 03:16.488
are mixed with

03:15.112 --> 03:16.488
the God knows what.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.991
Right away, Mr. Pinter.

03:30.085 --> 03:32.253
Okay. I'm off work

03:30.085 --> 03:32.253
in five minutes.

03:32.295 --> 03:33.630
Don't touch the register.

03:33.672 --> 03:35.256
Don't touch the candy,

03:33.672 --> 03:35.256
don't touch the price tags

03:35.298 --> 03:37.258
and don't touch the microphones.

03:37.300 --> 03:38.468
And that includes by accident.

03:38.510 --> 03:39.427
That includes just looking.

03:39.469 --> 03:40.846
That includes hovering

03:40.888 --> 03:42.764
with your finger

03:40.888 --> 03:42.764
a half inch away from it.

03:42.806 --> 03:45.225
Fair warning.

03:51.606 --> 03:53.274
Dare you.

03:53.316 --> 03:54.275
Go ahead.

03:54.317 --> 03:55.485
You do it.

03:55.527 --> 03:56.987
I'll do it.

03:55.527 --> 03:56.987
Yeah, right.

03:57.029 --> 03:58.864
I will.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.157
This isn't baby

03:58.906 --> 04:00.157
stuff, Dewey.

04:00.199 --> 04:01.616
Yeah, go ride the horsey

04:00.199 --> 04:01.616
out front.

04:03.326 --> 04:04.285
(chuckles)

04:04.327 --> 04:05.286
Horsey.

04:05.328 --> 04:07.372
I got to remember that.

04:07.414 --> 04:10.709
The microphone, register...

04:10.751 --> 04:13.962
candy... price tags...

04:14.004 --> 04:16.381
steam cleaner.

04:23.346 --> 04:25.140
Boys!

04:25.182 --> 04:28.518
It's not what it looks like!

04:32.147 --> 04:33.314
Oh, hello, boys.

04:33.356 --> 04:34.942
How long you in for?

04:34.983 --> 04:36.193
Another hour.

04:36.235 --> 04:37.236
Yow.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.237
Hi, hon.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.238
Hi.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.156
Did you see Dewey outside?

04:41.198 --> 04:42.490
Oh, what's wrong?

04:42.532 --> 04:44.618
I don't know,

04:42.532 --> 04:44.618
but something's upsetting him.

04:44.659 --> 04:46.787
He didn't say a word

04:44.659 --> 04:46.787
on the way home,

04:46.828 --> 04:49.414
and now I just can't

04:46.828 --> 04:49.414
find him anywhere.

04:49.456 --> 04:50.749
Hmm.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.584
Hey, I'll check

04:50.791 --> 04:52.584
his special place.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.586
Dewey?

04:54.628 --> 04:56.421
You in there, buddy?

04:56.463 --> 04:58.339
DEWEY:

04:56.463 --> 04:58.339
No.

04:58.381 --> 04:59.967
What's wrong, pal?

05:00.008 --> 05:01.718
I did something bad.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.971
They told me to ride a horsey,

05:01.760 --> 05:03.971
and I'm not a baby,

05:04.012 --> 05:06.014
but I would have played

05:04.012 --> 05:06.014
with the carpet cleaner,

05:06.056 --> 05:07.515
and I didn't have

05:06.056 --> 05:07.515
a quarter anyway.

05:07.557 --> 05:08.976
Uh-huh. Dewey, honey,

05:09.017 --> 05:10.852
Daddy's getting a cramp

05:09.017 --> 05:10.852
in his leg.

05:10.894 --> 05:12.187
What did you do?

05:12.229 --> 05:15.065
I took something

05:12.229 --> 05:15.065
from Mommy's store.

05:15.107 --> 05:16.399
Well, that's very serious.

05:16.441 --> 05:17.651
What did you take?

05:17.692 --> 05:18.735
A candy bar?

05:18.777 --> 05:21.238
No. It's not

05:18.777 --> 05:21.238
a candy bar.

05:21.280 --> 05:23.364
Oh? Well, what is it?

05:23.406 --> 05:27.161
$150 bottle of cognac?

05:27.202 --> 05:29.037
How could you take this?!

05:29.079 --> 05:30.956
I'm sorry.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.373
My God,

05:30.998 --> 05:32.373
would you look at this thing?

05:32.415 --> 05:33.583
Can you imagine the man

05:33.625 --> 05:35.376
who spends 150 bucks

05:33.625 --> 05:35.376
on a bottle of cognac?

05:35.418 --> 05:37.629
What do you think a guy

05:35.418 --> 05:37.629
like that pays for socks?

05:37.671 --> 05:39.380
Dewey, what am I

05:37.671 --> 05:39.380
going to do with you?

05:39.422 --> 05:41.883
This works

05:39.422 --> 05:41.883
pretty good, Mom.

05:41.925 --> 05:43.885
Go get your jacket; we're

05:41.925 --> 05:43.885
going back to the store.

05:43.927 --> 05:47.222
You are going to return

05:43.927 --> 05:47.222
this bottle to Mr. Pinter,

05:47.264 --> 05:49.766
apologize and accept

05:47.264 --> 05:49.766
the consequences.

05:49.808 --> 05:51.018
What do mean, "fired"?!

05:51.059 --> 05:52.477
You can't fire me for this.

05:52.519 --> 05:55.689
Sorry. Store policy is

05:52.519 --> 05:55.689
very clear about stealing.

05:55.730 --> 05:57.316
But he didn't steal it;

05:55.730 --> 05:57.316
he returned it.

05:57.356 --> 05:58.775
It's right there.

05:57.356 --> 05:58.775
The bottle is perfect.

05:58.817 --> 06:00.610
You can just put it

05:58.817 --> 06:00.610
right back on the shelf.

06:00.652 --> 06:02.279
I already marked it

06:00.652 --> 06:02.279
out of inventory.

06:02.321 --> 06:03.362
My hands are tied here.

06:04.656 --> 06:05.991
What are you talking about?

06:06.033 --> 06:07.617
You don't even do inventory.

06:07.659 --> 06:11.079
You foist if off on me because

06:07.659 --> 06:11.079
you make so many mistakes.

06:11.121 --> 06:13.707
You're not exactly making me

06:11.121 --> 06:13.707
regret my decision here, Lois.

06:13.748 --> 06:15.125
Mom?

06:15.167 --> 06:16.584
Oh, honey, it's

06:15.167 --> 06:16.584
okay. It's okay.

06:16.626 --> 06:18.253
This is just an excuse.

06:18.295 --> 06:20.672
You have hated me

06:18.295 --> 06:20.672
since the minute you got here

06:20.714 --> 06:24.343
because I was first choice for

06:20.714 --> 06:24.343
your job and I turned it down.

06:24.383 --> 06:26.845
You know, you think

06:24.383 --> 06:26.845
what you want, okay?

06:26.887 --> 06:29.097
At least I didn't raise a thief.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.559
(loud ripping sound,

06:30.473 --> 06:32.559
Pinter yells, workers gasp)

06:34.936 --> 06:37.564
Velcro. I win the pool.

06:44.403 --> 06:47.866
(reciting):

06:44.403 --> 06:47.866
Sweet home Alabama.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.868
(piano accompaniment)

06:49.910 --> 06:53.663
Where the skies are so blue.

06:56.499 --> 06:59.586
Sweet home Alabama.

07:01.296 --> 07:05.759
Lord, I'm coming home

07:05.800 --> 07:06.927
to you.

07:06.968 --> 07:09.763
(playing licks)

07:09.804 --> 07:11.932
(applause)

07:11.973 --> 07:13.683
Oh, very, very

07:11.973 --> 07:13.683
nice, Bridget.

07:13.725 --> 07:16.144
That was very nice.

07:16.186 --> 07:17.520
Oh, Francis, I wanted

07:16.186 --> 07:17.520
to thank you again

07:17.562 --> 07:19.314
for being so helpful.

07:19.356 --> 07:22.109
Usually, the honor guards

07:19.356 --> 07:22.109
just sit around and gawk,

07:22.150 --> 07:23.860
but you've really

07:22.150 --> 07:23.860
thrown yourself

07:23.902 --> 07:25.486
into this whole hog,

07:23.902 --> 07:25.486
haven't you?

07:25.528 --> 07:29.157
What can I say?

07:25.528 --> 07:29.157
I love the theater.

07:29.199 --> 07:32.869
Francis, will you help me

07:29.199 --> 07:32.869
decide on my leg extensions?

07:32.911 --> 07:34.871
Which do you think

07:32.911 --> 07:34.871
looks better--

07:34.913 --> 07:36.539
right leg...

07:36.581 --> 07:39.209
or left leg?

07:39.251 --> 07:41.169
Hmm.

07:41.211 --> 07:45.048
Can you... do both?

07:48.551 --> 07:51.388
It's been ten days

07:48.551 --> 07:51.388
since Mom lost her job.

07:51.430 --> 07:54.391
Yesterday for dinner,

07:51.430 --> 07:54.391
we had macaroni and rice.

07:54.433 --> 07:56.184
Today it's rice and macaroni.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.937
Mom, I can't eat

07:56.226 --> 07:58.937
this stuff anymore.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.563
Reese, this is not the time

07:58.979 --> 08:00.563
for complaining.

08:00.605 --> 08:03.524
I'm not complaining;

08:00.605 --> 08:03.524
I'm constipated.

08:03.566 --> 08:06.403
I'm sorry, we can't afford

08:03.566 --> 08:06.403
to live lavishly anymore.

08:06.445 --> 08:07.237
Drink your milk.

08:07.279 --> 08:08.029
It's lumpy.

08:08.071 --> 08:09.406
Then chew it.

08:09.448 --> 08:11.532
Hey, come on, we can do this.

08:11.574 --> 08:13.534
We've had to economize before.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.912
Remember when Grandma drove

08:13.576 --> 08:15.912
into the living room?

08:15.954 --> 08:18.623
Or last year, when we were

08:15.954 --> 08:18.623
saving up for Disneyland?

08:18.665 --> 08:20.459
We're going to Disneyland?

08:20.500 --> 08:21.542
No.

08:21.584 --> 08:23.170
It's  like  that.

08:23.211 --> 08:25.713
Except this time, we're just

08:23.211 --> 08:25.713
trying to keep the house.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.841
Okay, everybody, stop worrying.

08:27.882 --> 08:30.344
I am going to find another job.

08:30.385 --> 08:32.471
Another cashier job

08:30.385 --> 08:32.471
with flexible hours

08:32.512 --> 08:36.475
that allows me to leave whenever

08:32.512 --> 08:36.475
I need to take care of my kids.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.559
Well, can't you get

08:36.516 --> 08:38.559
unemployment or something?

08:38.601 --> 08:40.061
No. I only worked

08:38.601 --> 08:40.061
38 hours a week.

08:40.103 --> 08:41.480
They consider that part-time.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.564
You know, I hope

08:41.521 --> 08:43.564
you are at least learning

08:43.606 --> 08:45.275
something

08:43.606 --> 08:45.275
from all this.

08:45.317 --> 08:48.403
Yeah, if you do

08:45.317 --> 08:48.403
something bad, don't tell.

08:48.445 --> 08:49.570
No. We did the right thing.

08:49.612 --> 08:51.156
That's what's important.

08:51.198 --> 08:54.075
Can't we at least do a load

08:51.198 --> 08:54.075
of laundry or something?

08:54.117 --> 08:55.576
Everything I have stinks.

08:55.618 --> 08:58.579
Yeah, he wants to smell

08:55.618 --> 08:58.579
good for...  Julie!

08:58.621 --> 08:59.664
(gagging)

08:59.706 --> 09:00.915
Malcolm.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.960
Yeah, yeah.

09:06.921 --> 09:09.174
It was worth it.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.592
So we can't do laundry,

09:09.216 --> 09:11.592
we have to share baths,

09:11.634 --> 09:14.262
and yesterday, she had

09:11.634 --> 09:14.262
our cable turned off.

09:14.304 --> 09:15.805
Our cable!

09:15.847 --> 09:18.808
How's your... love life?

09:20.227 --> 09:22.229
What?

09:20.227 --> 09:22.229
So, basically,

09:20.227 --> 09:22.229
everything I tell you

09:22.270 --> 09:23.604
in confidence as a friend

09:23.646 --> 09:25.606
you're going to use

09:23.646 --> 09:25.606
to make fun of me?

09:25.648 --> 09:28.609
I have... nothing else.

09:28.651 --> 09:30.111
Hi, Malcolm.

09:30.153 --> 09:31.530
You want to split lunches?

09:31.571 --> 09:32.906
What?

09:32.947 --> 09:34.574
Yeah, sure.

09:44.042 --> 09:46.169
(wheels creaking)

09:49.130 --> 09:52.633
I have a Chinese chicken

09:49.130 --> 09:52.633
salad, a tangerine,

09:52.675 --> 09:54.635
and, ooh, Jordan almonds.

09:54.677 --> 09:56.096
What do you have?

09:56.137 --> 09:58.639
Leftover eggs

09:56.137 --> 09:58.639
from breakfast.

09:58.681 --> 10:00.434
Oh.

10:00.475 --> 10:03.270
Uh, I'm on a special diet,

10:00.475 --> 10:03.270
for sports.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.688
Oh, I forgot.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.648
I have to go...

10:05.730 --> 10:07.648
work out.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.609
I'll see you later.

10:12.070 --> 10:14.030
I can't take

10:12.070 --> 10:14.030
this anymore!

10:14.072 --> 10:16.157
Everything I want,

10:14.072 --> 10:16.157
I can't have!

10:16.199 --> 10:17.700
Anything that's nice,

10:16.199 --> 10:17.700
I can't do!

10:17.742 --> 10:20.828
Everyone in the world

10:17.742 --> 10:20.828
gets to do everything except me!

10:20.870 --> 10:23.039
Malcolm...

10:20.870 --> 10:23.039
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:23.081 --> 10:24.665
I know there's other people

10:23.081 --> 10:24.665
worse off than me.

10:24.707 --> 10:26.667
You know what?

10:24.707 --> 10:26.667
I don't care.

10:26.709 --> 10:29.546
I'm sick of going to school

10:26.709 --> 10:29.546
every day smelling like feet!

10:29.588 --> 10:30.964
Malcolm...

10:31.005 --> 10:32.507
I hate being poor, okay?!

10:32.549 --> 10:33.674
I mean, is that so bad?

10:33.716 --> 10:36.052
Why is that, like,

10:33.716 --> 10:36.052
some big character flaw?

10:36.094 --> 10:37.678
It's not my fault

10:36.094 --> 10:37.678
we're poor!

10:37.720 --> 10:38.388
Malcolm!

10:38.430 --> 10:40.681
You, um...

10:40.723 --> 10:42.892
left your backpack.

10:45.728 --> 10:48.773
Maybe you should try taking

10:45.728 --> 10:48.773
a really deep breath

10:48.815 --> 10:51.568
before  you start talking.

10:48.815 --> 10:51.568
Yeah.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.154
Francis, where have you been?

10:54.195 --> 10:55.989
I've been looking for you

10:54.195 --> 10:55.989
for days.

10:56.030 --> 10:58.992
I'm sorry, Dad.

10:56.030 --> 10:58.992
I've just been buried here.

10:59.033 --> 11:02.078
Okay, listen, I've got kind of

11:02.120 --> 11:03.913
a good news/bad news thing here.

11:03.955 --> 11:05.624
(sighs)

11:05.665 --> 11:08.209
Your mom lost her job,

11:05.665 --> 11:08.209
and we're pretty broke.

11:08.251 --> 11:11.087
The good news is, that makes

11:08.251 --> 11:11.087
your tuition an issue.

11:11.129 --> 11:14.715
Now, I think I can talk her

11:11.129 --> 11:14.715
into letting you come home.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.551
Dad, no, I can't come home!

11:16.593 --> 11:18.428
Marlin Academy

11:16.593 --> 11:18.428
is the best thing

11:18.470 --> 11:19.929
that has ever

11:18.470 --> 11:19.929
happened to me.

11:19.971 --> 11:21.764
I am at a crucial point

11:19.971 --> 11:21.764
in my rehabilitation.

11:21.806 --> 11:23.975
Uh-huh. What's her name?

11:24.017 --> 11:26.685
That's the thing--

11:24.017 --> 11:26.685
there's, like, ten of them!

11:27.562 --> 11:29.356
(knock at door)

11:29.397 --> 11:32.526
Check the peephole.

11:32.567 --> 11:35.028
If they've got a hand truck,

11:32.567 --> 11:35.028
don't open it.

11:35.069 --> 11:36.737
(knocking continues)

11:36.779 --> 11:38.781
(door opens, closes)

11:38.823 --> 11:40.575
Craig, what are

11:38.823 --> 11:40.575
you doing here?

11:40.617 --> 11:42.785
Lois, I just had a meeting

11:40.617 --> 11:42.785
with Mr. Pinter--

11:42.827 --> 11:44.787
well, more like an hour

11:42.827 --> 11:44.787
begging, really--

11:44.829 --> 11:47.207
but the point is, you can

11:44.829 --> 11:47.207
have your old job back!

11:47.248 --> 11:48.333
Yes!

11:48.375 --> 11:51.419
Craig, that is such good news!

11:51.461 --> 11:53.754
And all you have to do

11:51.461 --> 11:53.754
is apologize.

11:53.796 --> 11:57.133
And let him dock your pay

11:53.796 --> 11:57.133
150 bucks.

11:57.175 --> 11:59.135
And you have to work

11:57.175 --> 11:59.135
the graveyard shift

11:59.177 --> 12:00.637
for a couple months.

12:00.679 --> 12:01.762
Oh.

12:01.804 --> 12:03.557
Sounds good, Mom.

12:03.598 --> 12:04.765
No, thanks.

12:03.598 --> 12:04.765
What?!

12:04.807 --> 12:06.434
You're kidding!

12:04.807 --> 12:06.434
Why?!

12:06.476 --> 12:08.769
Because  that's like admitting

12:06.476 --> 12:08.769
he's right.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.271
I'm not going to do that.

12:10.313 --> 12:12.440
Lois, if this makes

12:10.313 --> 12:12.440
any difference,

12:12.482 --> 12:15.776
I will work every graveyard

12:12.482 --> 12:15.776
shift right alongside you--

12:15.818 --> 12:17.612
every single one of them.

12:17.654 --> 12:18.779
Oh, hi, Craig.

12:17.654 --> 12:18.779
What's going on?

12:18.821 --> 12:20.781
Nothing. Just business.

12:20.823 --> 12:23.410
Take it easy, tiger.

12:23.451 --> 12:24.994
We're working.

12:25.036 --> 12:26.538
Well, I am.

12:27.288 --> 12:28.707
Hi.

12:28.747 --> 12:30.749
Back to the grind.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.546
Nice guy.

12:43.054 --> 12:44.889
WOMAN:

12:43.054 --> 12:44.889
Thank you, Tanya.

12:44.931 --> 12:47.434
Tanya, that was

12:44.931 --> 12:47.434
fantastic.

12:47.475 --> 12:49.394
I swear, when you

12:47.475 --> 12:49.394
put tap to it,

12:49.436 --> 12:51.896
the Pledge of Allegiance

12:49.436 --> 12:51.896
just comes alive.

12:51.938 --> 12:54.857
One suggestion:

12:51.938 --> 12:54.857
do you have a tube top?

12:54.899 --> 12:57.277
Oh, Francis, you are

12:54.899 --> 12:57.277
just wonderful.

12:57.318 --> 13:00.447
I mean, you're so different

12:57.318 --> 13:00.447
than the local boys.

13:00.488 --> 13:03.074
I mean, I haven't even

13:00.488 --> 13:03.074
known you that long,

13:03.116 --> 13:06.202
and I already feel

13:03.116 --> 13:06.202
so connected to you.

13:06.244 --> 13:08.079
I know. It's almost mystical.

13:08.121 --> 13:11.999
Yeah. And I'm so glad the

13:08.121 --> 13:11.999
gay thing isn't an issue.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.834
You're gay?

13:13.876 --> 13:16.713
No, no, silly--  you  are.

13:16.755 --> 13:18.673
Wait, you think I'm gay?

13:18.715 --> 13:20.717
Oh, you don't have to

13:18.715 --> 13:20.717
hide anything, honey.

13:20.759 --> 13:22.469
I mean, we're a lot

13:20.759 --> 13:22.469
more liberal here

13:22.510 --> 13:23.844
than you think we are.

13:23.886 --> 13:26.847
I mean, it's not

13:23.886 --> 13:26.847
like Birmingham.

13:26.889 --> 13:29.850
Wait a minute--

13:26.889 --> 13:29.850
you think I'm gay?

13:29.892 --> 13:31.227
Why do you think I'm gay?

13:31.269 --> 13:32.853
Oh, come on.

13:32.895 --> 13:35.482
You like the theater,

13:32.895 --> 13:35.482
you're good with decorating,

13:35.523 --> 13:38.901
and, well, you're completely

13:35.523 --> 13:38.901
obsessed with your mother.

13:38.943 --> 13:41.112
Can you undo my hooks?

13:42.530 --> 13:45.032
Tanya, I'm kind of having

13:42.530 --> 13:45.032
a dilemma here...

13:45.074 --> 13:48.869
Oh, great.

13:45.074 --> 13:48.869
Frannie, can you spray me?

13:48.911 --> 13:50.121
My suit keeps riding up.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.372
(giggling)

13:54.125 --> 13:57.587
That's why I'm here...

13:54.125 --> 13:57.587
girlfriend.

14:03.802 --> 14:05.679
So what did you

14:03.802 --> 14:05.679
want to talk about?

14:05.720 --> 14:07.888
I'm your teacher.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.888
Can't we just talk?

14:07.930 --> 14:10.891
You know, that

14:07.930 --> 14:10.891
Julie Houlerman

14:10.933 --> 14:13.812
is a very special

14:10.933 --> 14:13.812
little girl.

14:13.852 --> 14:15.522
Oh, come on!

14:15.563 --> 14:16.731
Caroline,

14:15.563 --> 14:16.731
I don't want to...

14:16.773 --> 14:18.899
Malcolm, Malcolm, Malcolm.

14:18.941 --> 14:21.902
So private, so guarded.

14:21.944 --> 14:24.905
But you don't have to

14:21.944 --> 14:24.905
be that way with me.

14:24.947 --> 14:27.367
I'm on your side.

14:27.408 --> 14:30.495
Julie knows that-- she's

14:27.408 --> 14:30.495
not even in my class.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.539
She talked to you?

14:30.537 --> 14:32.539
About me?

14:32.580 --> 14:33.832
What'd she say?

14:33.873 --> 14:37.502
Aw, nothing that wasn't

14:33.873 --> 14:37.502
obvious already.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.003
You know, when you

14:37.544 --> 14:39.003
open up to people,

14:39.045 --> 14:41.172
you will always

14:39.045 --> 14:41.172
be surprised

14:41.214 --> 14:44.300
just how well

14:41.214 --> 14:44.300
things turn out.

14:44.342 --> 14:47.470
ALL:

14:44.342 --> 14:47.470
Surprise!

14:51.641 --> 14:53.017
Isn't it wonderful?

14:53.059 --> 14:54.935
Julie organized

14:54.977 --> 14:57.188
the whole thing herself,

14:54.977 --> 14:57.188
and everyone

14:57.230 --> 14:59.148
in school responded.

14:59.190 --> 15:02.109
Dear Malcolm, this

14:59.190 --> 15:02.109
isn't just food.

15:02.151 --> 15:04.945
It's an expression of how

15:02.151 --> 15:04.945
we all feel about you.

15:04.987 --> 15:08.616
Our hearts go out to you

15:04.987 --> 15:08.616
in your time of need.

15:08.658 --> 15:10.910
(applause)

15:25.717 --> 15:27.844
You're going

15:25.717 --> 15:27.844
to keep the food?

15:25.717 --> 15:27.844
Yes.

15:27.886 --> 15:30.221
I'm not going to throw away

15:27.886 --> 15:30.221
perfectly good pie filling

15:30.263 --> 15:31.972
and... lamb chutney.

15:32.014 --> 15:34.141
Don't you even care

15:32.014 --> 15:34.141
how humiliating this is?

15:34.183 --> 15:35.852
REESE:

15:34.183 --> 15:35.852
We've done can drives.

15:35.894 --> 15:37.061
This is just the

15:35.894 --> 15:37.061
crap people find

15:37.103 --> 15:38.605
when they clean

15:37.103 --> 15:38.605
out the garage.

15:38.646 --> 15:39.689
Okay, just stop it.

15:39.731 --> 15:41.900
I know how

15:39.731 --> 15:41.900
hard this is,

15:41.941 --> 15:43.693
but no one ever said

15:41.941 --> 15:43.693
life is fair.

15:43.735 --> 15:45.069
Sometimes decent,

15:43.735 --> 15:45.069
hard-working people

15:45.111 --> 15:46.613
get dumped on

15:45.111 --> 15:46.613
for no good reason,

15:46.654 --> 15:47.988
and they just have

15:46.654 --> 15:47.988
to wipe out their eyes

15:48.030 --> 15:48.989
and keep on walking.

15:49.031 --> 15:51.242
Something will

15:49.031 --> 15:51.242
turn up.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.787
We just have to hold on

15:51.284 --> 15:53.787
a little bit longer.

15:53.828 --> 15:56.664
And in the meantime, be

15:53.828 --> 15:56.664
thankful for small favors.

15:56.706 --> 15:59.626
Anyone want the last olive?

15:59.667 --> 16:01.210
Those aren't olives.

16:01.252 --> 16:02.962
Those are peaches.

16:05.047 --> 16:06.966
(siren wailing)

16:09.886 --> 16:12.096
Well, you got him here

16:09.886 --> 16:12.096
early, that's good.

16:12.138 --> 16:13.932
He'll be fine

16:12.138 --> 16:13.932
in a few days.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.517
Just like when this

16:13.973 --> 16:16.517
one ate the frog.

16:16.559 --> 16:18.269
I only ate half of it.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.814
I won't put

16:18.311 --> 16:20.814
the stomach pump on the bill.

16:20.855 --> 16:23.608
I mean, he did most

16:20.855 --> 16:23.608
of the work on the way over.

16:23.650 --> 16:24.901
Thanks, Don. Uh...

16:24.943 --> 16:27.027
listen, as far

16:24.943 --> 16:27.027
as the bill goes,

16:27.069 --> 16:30.030
what kind of neighborhood

16:27.069 --> 16:30.030
are we in?

16:30.072 --> 16:31.616
Well... the emergency room,

16:31.658 --> 16:33.701
couple days

16:31.658 --> 16:33.701
of observation--

16:33.743 --> 16:35.202
probably three or four.

16:35.244 --> 16:38.038
Three or four...

16:35.244 --> 16:38.038
hun...?

16:54.347 --> 16:55.682
Okay.

16:55.723 --> 16:57.057
You boys take

16:55.723 --> 16:57.057
care of your dad.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.142
I'm going to go see Mr. Pinter

16:58.184 --> 16:59.435
and beg for my job back.

16:59.477 --> 17:00.520
What? Mom, wait.

17:00.561 --> 17:02.062
You don't have

17:00.561 --> 17:02.062
to do that.

17:02.104 --> 17:03.648
Yes, I do. I don't want to,

17:03.690 --> 17:05.441
shouldn't have to,

17:03.690 --> 17:05.441
but guess what?

17:05.483 --> 17:06.901
I do.

17:06.943 --> 17:08.486
But I want you boys

17:06.943 --> 17:08.486
to understand something.

17:08.528 --> 17:11.322
I am not going back

17:08.528 --> 17:11.322
on anything I said before.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.157
She's completely

17:11.364 --> 17:13.157
going back on it,

17:13.199 --> 17:15.952
but I'm not going

17:13.199 --> 17:15.952
to kick her when she's down.

17:15.994 --> 17:17.871
You're totally

17:15.994 --> 17:17.871
going back on it.

17:17.912 --> 17:19.079
No, I am not.

17:19.121 --> 17:21.499
Everything I said before

17:19.121 --> 17:21.499
still goes.

17:21.541 --> 17:22.792
You know, sometimes

17:21.541 --> 17:22.792
bad things happen

17:22.834 --> 17:24.752
and you don't

17:22.834 --> 17:24.752
understand why,

17:24.794 --> 17:27.964
and you just have to trust that

17:24.794 --> 17:27.964
there's a good reason for it.

17:29.590 --> 17:31.676
Sure, it's easy

17:29.590 --> 17:31.676
to work in mysterious ways

17:31.718 --> 17:33.928
when you  have  a job.

17:36.347 --> 17:39.099
(long, gassy whine)

17:39.141 --> 17:41.019
(farts)

17:41.060 --> 17:43.103
(groans)

17:43.145 --> 17:47.358
The first one who laughs

17:43.145 --> 17:47.358
gets their ass kicked.

17:50.820 --> 17:52.112
(moans)

17:52.154 --> 17:55.115
You have

17:52.154 --> 17:55.115
incredible hands.

17:55.157 --> 17:59.161
Well, it's easy

17:55.157 --> 17:59.161
on such a beautiful back.

17:59.203 --> 18:02.331
Not to mention

17:59.203 --> 18:02.331
the most talented...

18:02.373 --> 18:05.125
sweet...

18:05.167 --> 18:06.419
sexy...

18:09.338 --> 18:10.506
What?

18:10.548 --> 18:12.132
Francis...

18:12.174 --> 18:16.387
are... are you sure

18:12.174 --> 18:16.387
you're really...

18:16.429 --> 18:18.973
how you are?

18:20.182 --> 18:23.143
Tanya, I'm so confused.

18:23.185 --> 18:27.189
I mean, I thought that I was,

18:23.185 --> 18:27.189
but when I'm around you,

18:27.231 --> 18:30.985
I have these...

18:27.231 --> 18:30.985
strange, new feelings.

18:31.027 --> 18:36.699
I feel like...

18:31.027 --> 18:36.699
maybe I could... change.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.787
That you could be

18:38.200 --> 18:40.787
the woman who changes me.

18:40.828 --> 18:44.082
Oh, Francis...

18:44.123 --> 18:46.417
I was hoping you'd say that.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.377
I want to be that woman

18:48.419 --> 18:49.670
for you.

18:49.712 --> 18:51.672
Oh, and don't

18:49.712 --> 18:51.672
you worry, honey.

18:51.714 --> 18:54.634
If there's one thing

18:51.714 --> 18:54.634
we know how to do

18:54.675 --> 18:56.094
down here,

18:56.135 --> 18:58.805
it's how to fix this.

19:00.222 --> 19:02.058
MAN:

19:00.222 --> 19:02.058
And with God's help,

19:02.100 --> 19:04.894
we can say "no!" to weakness.

19:04.936 --> 19:08.564
We can say "no!"

19:04.936 --> 19:08.564
to all things unnatural!

19:08.606 --> 19:12.192
It is procreation,

19:08.606 --> 19:12.192
not recreation!

19:12.234 --> 19:16.196
And when Satan tempts us,

19:12.234 --> 19:16.196
what do we do?

19:16.238 --> 19:17.782
Pray out the gay.

19:17.824 --> 19:18.866
Get to it!

19:26.248 --> 19:28.375
I have to say, Lois,

19:26.248 --> 19:28.375
I'm surprised

19:28.417 --> 19:30.586
by this change

19:28.417 --> 19:30.586
in your attitude.

19:30.628 --> 19:32.379
Yeah, well, me, too.

19:32.421 --> 19:34.674
I know we've had

19:32.421 --> 19:34.674
our differences,

19:34.715 --> 19:37.259
but I hope that we

19:34.715 --> 19:37.259
can make all this

19:37.301 --> 19:39.095
water under the bridge.

19:39.137 --> 19:41.221
So, if you'll

19:39.137 --> 19:41.221
just sign here...

19:41.263 --> 19:42.473
Mm, what's this?

19:42.515 --> 19:44.058
Your apology.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.936
I think I captured

19:44.100 --> 19:46.936
your voice rather nicely.

19:46.978 --> 19:49.022
You want it in writing?

19:49.063 --> 19:50.272
Yes.

19:50.314 --> 19:52.232
Look, Lois, you can

19:50.314 --> 19:52.232
tell these clowns

19:52.274 --> 19:54.861
whatever you want--

19:52.274 --> 19:54.861
that I got on my knees

19:54.902 --> 19:57.113
and begged you to come

19:54.902 --> 19:57.113
back, I don't care.

19:57.155 --> 20:01.200
I just want you and I to

19:57.155 --> 20:01.200
know how things  really  are.

20:17.133 --> 20:18.300
That's not a signature.

20:18.342 --> 20:20.260
No, it's more

20:18.342 --> 20:20.260
of a suggestion.

20:20.302 --> 20:22.262
"The horse you rode in on"

20:20.302 --> 20:22.262
is optional.

20:22.304 --> 20:23.556
Now, look...

20:23.597 --> 20:24.724
No, you look.

20:24.765 --> 20:25.725
I don't deserve this.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.267
The only thing

20:25.766 --> 20:27.267
I ever did wrong

20:27.309 --> 20:29.269
was all the work I did

20:27.309 --> 20:29.269
to cover your butt.

20:29.311 --> 20:30.521
Well, we obviously

20:29.311 --> 20:30.521
have different

20:30.563 --> 20:31.772
definitions of "wrong."

20:31.814 --> 20:33.273
Yeah, I guess we do.

20:33.315 --> 20:34.942
For instance,

20:33.315 --> 20:34.942
I think it's wrong

20:34.984 --> 20:36.527
for you to put your name

20:34.984 --> 20:36.527
on sales reports

20:36.569 --> 20:38.278
that you didn't write.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.322
I think it's wrong you keep

20:38.320 --> 20:40.322
a little bag of "herbs"

20:40.364 --> 20:41.908
in your bottom left drawer.

20:41.949 --> 20:43.117
I think it's wrong

20:41.949 --> 20:43.117
you slept with

20:43.159 --> 20:44.160
the district manager's wife.

20:44.202 --> 20:45.912
And you want

20:44.202 --> 20:45.912
to know something?

20:45.953 --> 20:47.872
You don't even

20:45.953 --> 20:47.872
have to worry about it,

20:47.914 --> 20:51.458
because I also think it's wrong

20:47.914 --> 20:51.458
to blab this kind of thing.

20:51.500 --> 20:55.295
You know, you should be so glad

20:51.500 --> 20:55.295
that I'm the only one that knows

20:55.337 --> 20:57.673
this stuff about you.

20:57.715 --> 21:01.385
Anyone else here would sell you

20:57.715 --> 21:01.385
down the river in a second.

21:02.344 --> 21:04.304
(chuckles)

21:04.346 --> 21:07.307
God, I am so much

21:04.346 --> 21:07.307
better than you.

21:12.146 --> 21:13.355
(clears throat)

21:20.362 --> 21:23.323
Yeah, he just ran off

21:20.362 --> 21:23.323
and quit for no reason.

21:23.365 --> 21:25.367
Huh, who knows why?

21:25.409 --> 21:27.828
See, you do

21:25.409 --> 21:27.828
the right thing,

21:27.870 --> 21:31.290
and everything

21:27.870 --> 21:31.290
works out for the best.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.334
Clean.

21:34.376 --> 21:38.005
I have Ho Hos-- real Ho Hos.

21:38.047 --> 21:39.757
You know,

21:38.047 --> 21:39.757
I'm sure I'm neglecting

21:39.799 --> 21:42.551
my spiritual side, but...

21:39.799 --> 21:42.551
money rules.

21:42.593 --> 21:44.344
The best part is

21:44.386 --> 21:47.807
I can finally get everything

21:44.386 --> 21:47.807
straightened out with Julie.

21:47.848 --> 21:49.142
Hi, Malcolm.

21:49.183 --> 21:50.601
Look, we're not poor anymore!

21:50.643 --> 21:53.312
So I don't want any more

21:50.643 --> 21:53.312
of your stupid pity, okay?!

21:55.856 --> 21:58.067
That helped, right?
