00:12.509 --> 00:15.330
As long as Heller discloses
the police report by next week.

00:15.398 --> 00:17.860
Either way, I assume
that we're doing everything

00:17.928 --> 00:20.668
in our power to avoid
going to trial.

00:20.736 --> 00:23.079
Okay, that's it.

00:23.153 --> 00:25.418
Have a good weekend.

00:27.891 --> 00:31.872
By the way, Lonnie, I-I came
across an old file of my dad's

00:31.940 --> 00:33.542
and-- really bizarre--

00:33.610 --> 00:35.152
it was labeled something like,

00:35.219 --> 00:36.592
"Flock of the Grey Shepherd"...?

00:36.659 --> 00:38.259
Ring a bell?

00:38.327 --> 00:40.231
No. Sorry.

00:41.668 --> 00:43.828
How about this-this photo?

00:43.896 --> 00:46.156
Pretty weird, huh?

00:46.224 --> 00:50.596
Very weird, but, no,
I've never seen it before.

00:50.664 --> 00:52.727
Your father handled a lot of
cases I wasn't involved in.

00:52.795 --> 00:54.697
Ryan...

00:54.765 --> 00:58.800
I hope you know you can take off
as much time as you need.

01:00.136 --> 01:02.175
I appreciate that.

01:17.063 --> 01:18.500
DREW:
Dodgers Brewers, bro!

01:18.568 --> 01:20.637
Thursday night, fourth row,

01:20.705 --> 01:22.425
down the third base line,
behind the dugout.

01:22.472 --> 01:23.873
They're my boss's
season tickets.

01:23.941 --> 01:25.879
Oh, you-you don't want
to take Jenna?

01:25.946 --> 01:27.814
No, she refuses to go
to Dodger Stadium

01:27.882 --> 01:31.621
ever since she saw another Brew
Crew fan get stomped out there.

01:31.689 --> 01:34.664
I keep telling her, just wear
a Dodgers shirt and cheer

01:34.732 --> 01:37.734
on the inside.
Man, I-I...I'd love to go.

01:37.802 --> 01:41.446
But I've got a conference call
with a client in Japan.

01:41.513 --> 01:43.147
It'll be afternoon there.

01:43.214 --> 01:45.784
Sorry, Drew.

01:45.852 --> 01:47.516
Let's-let's hang out
soon, though.

01:47.584 --> 01:48.950
What are you doing here?

01:49.018 --> 01:51.420
We don't have
a lot of time, mate.

01:51.488 --> 01:54.060
I've been thinking
about the whole "Am I a dog,

01:54.128 --> 01:55.964
am I a god" thing,

01:56.031 --> 01:59.669
and I've discovered something
that's gonna blow your mind.

02:02.869 --> 02:05.904
Notice anything about
the letters in this word?

02:07.242 --> 02:08.640
(laughs) Come on!

02:08.709 --> 02:10.208
It's so obvious.

02:10.276 --> 02:14.081
The letter "D" is the fourth
letter of the alphabet.

02:14.149 --> 02:16.282
The Bible says there are
four corners of the Earth.

02:16.350 --> 02:19.254
To see all four corners,
you have to travel around

02:19.322 --> 02:22.223
the world, and, as everybody
knows, that takes 80 days.

02:22.291 --> 02:23.725
"Eighty" rhymes with "deity."

02:23.792 --> 02:26.364
And "deity" is
another word for...

02:28.970 --> 02:31.570
I'm a god, Ryan!

02:31.638 --> 02:33.404
(laughs)
Oh, come on!

02:33.472 --> 02:35.507
Remember what those kids
said about the cult?

02:35.575 --> 02:37.512
I'm here to lead
you to happiness.

02:37.579 --> 02:39.013
Even if it's true,

02:39.080 --> 02:41.040
Jenna only lets us hang out
a couple hours a week.

02:41.082 --> 02:42.785
Which means we've
got to move fast.

02:42.853 --> 02:45.258
Now the way I see it, if you and
Jenna are to end up together...

02:45.325 --> 02:48.027
Wait-wait-- you think my
happiness is being with Jenna?

02:48.094 --> 02:50.095
It's okay.
I'm cool with it now.

02:50.162 --> 02:51.797
She's married.

02:51.864 --> 02:54.836
For now, but you
can change all that

02:54.904 --> 02:58.540
by asking Drew how
your dick tastes.

02:58.608 --> 03:01.173
What? You know Jenna
and I only kissed, right?

03:01.241 --> 03:04.343
Yeah, and us dudes use
the same tongue to kiss

03:04.410 --> 03:06.078
that we do to clean our dicks.

03:06.146 --> 03:08.014
Jesus, you are slow today.

03:08.082 --> 03:11.749
Anyway, tell Drew you kissed
his wife, and they'll break up.

03:11.817 --> 03:13.485
First off, Jenna kissed me.

03:13.553 --> 03:15.053
And there's no way
I'm telling him anything.

03:15.121 --> 03:16.521
I've seen how he gets
when he's mad.

03:16.588 --> 03:18.122
Whether you tell him or not,

03:18.190 --> 03:19.958
there are gonna be
consequences to that kiss.

03:20.025 --> 03:21.626
Now, the sooner you
deal with them,

03:21.694 --> 03:23.360
the sooner you can move on.

03:23.428 --> 03:26.030
Why are we talking about this?
I don't care about any of that.

03:26.098 --> 03:27.800
Okay, then what do
you care about?

03:27.868 --> 03:30.737
About finding the connection
between my dad and the cult.

03:30.804 --> 03:32.037
Then I'll lead you to that.

03:32.105 --> 03:35.039
I don't need you
to lead me to anything.

03:35.107 --> 03:37.878
I can't find my dad's name
on any of these documents.

03:37.945 --> 03:40.249
But it seems to me, some sort of

03:40.317 --> 03:42.584
shell corporation was
established by the cult,

03:42.652 --> 03:44.019
to buy some property up north.

03:44.087 --> 03:47.190
I looked it up online
and found this--

03:47.258 --> 03:50.592
the exact same gorge
in the background...

03:50.660 --> 03:52.429
of this photo.

03:52.496 --> 03:54.932
I'm gonna go up there
this weekend and check it out.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.501
But Jenna will never let me go
away with you for that long.

03:57.568 --> 04:01.107
I know. I'm sorry.
What good is being able to lead

04:01.175 --> 04:04.009
the chosen one to happiness if
you're not even allowed to go?

04:04.077 --> 04:06.078
What are you
talking about, Bear?

04:06.146 --> 04:07.949
I lead you to happiness
all the time.

04:08.017 --> 04:09.519
Sometimes several times a day.

04:09.586 --> 04:11.452
What do you mean,

04:11.519 --> 04:13.085
"Not even once"?

04:13.153 --> 04:15.273
There's no way you could have
faked all those orgasms.

04:26.631 --> 04:29.965
I'll have what Bear's having.

04:30.033 --> 04:31.434
(door closes)

04:31.501 --> 04:33.067
DREW:
Knock, knock. Hey.

04:33.135 --> 04:35.300
We were just
on a little strollski back

04:35.368 --> 04:37.671
from the ice cream shop
and saw your lights on.

04:37.739 --> 04:39.971
This is, uh, our niece, Darcey.

04:40.038 --> 04:41.641
She's just visiting
for the weekend.

04:41.708 --> 04:44.680
Hi.
Will you go to Disneyland with us tomorrow?

04:44.748 --> 04:46.581
Me? Really?

04:46.649 --> 04:48.817
Okay, I asked him for you.
Give me my gelato.

04:50.222 --> 04:53.256
Ah. Well, you know,

04:53.324 --> 04:55.592
Jenna and Darcey always
sit together on the rides,

04:55.659 --> 04:58.196
so, I get crammed into a teacup

04:58.264 --> 05:01.598
with a horny, 50-year-old
with a Minnie Mouse tramp stamp.

05:01.666 --> 05:03.802
I'm talking about a dude.

05:03.870 --> 05:05.905
Sorry, I'm busy this weekend.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.838
Yeah. You doing
some camping?

05:08.906 --> 05:12.109
I love camping.
Just being out in nature.

05:12.177 --> 05:14.647
You know, kicking
anything you want.

05:14.714 --> 05:17.215
Yeah, yeah, I-I was
totally gonna invite you,

05:17.283 --> 05:20.255
um, but it sounds like
you're gonna be at Disneyland.

05:20.323 --> 05:21.855
Sucks.

05:21.923 --> 05:25.322
Drew? I thought
you were watching Darcey.

05:25.390 --> 05:28.558
Oh, yeah, I was just talking
to Ryan for a second.

05:28.626 --> 05:30.291
Hi, Ryan.

05:30.358 --> 05:31.591
Hi.

05:31.659 --> 05:33.159
Can I speak with you inside?

05:33.226 --> 05:34.926
Sure.
Come on, sweetie.

05:34.994 --> 05:38.093
Uh-oh, looks like
I'm in the doghouse.

05:38.161 --> 05:40.794
It's a figure of speech, Ryan.

05:40.862 --> 05:42.063
It means he has AIDS.

05:42.130 --> 05:44.130
About your happiness?

05:44.197 --> 05:45.799
I'm on it, dude.

05:45.867 --> 05:48.270
Should lead you to it by
tomorrow, Monday at the latest.

05:48.338 --> 05:50.737
JENNA:
Wilfred, come!

05:57.408 --> 05:59.311
Morning, camping compadre!

05:59.379 --> 06:01.283
Drew. What's going on?

06:01.350 --> 06:04.584
Well, Darcey had some ice
cream on her face last night,

06:04.652 --> 06:06.420
and Wilfred just went for it.

06:06.488 --> 06:09.759
Nipped her, but, long story
short, no more Disneyland.

06:09.826 --> 06:11.159
Wait-- he bit her?

06:11.227 --> 06:13.562
Yeah...
Jenna wasn't so psyched

06:13.630 --> 06:15.966
on me taking off with you,
but at the same time,

06:16.034 --> 06:17.233
she doesn't want
Wilfred hanging around

06:17.301 --> 06:18.622
while Darcey was
still here, so...

06:18.668 --> 06:20.836
You don't mind, right?
Shotgun!

06:24.040 --> 06:25.841
I can't believe this.

06:25.909 --> 06:27.710
The last thing I want to do is
spend the weekend with Drew.

06:27.777 --> 06:29.679
Drew's presence
is a small price to pay

06:29.746 --> 06:32.116
to have your god by your side.

06:32.761 --> 06:35.496
Oh, man, I feel so bad
for ants right now.

06:35.564 --> 06:37.696
Their hills are
gonna get so kicked!

06:38.253 --> 06:43.161
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

06:45.307 --> 06:46.675
This way, Ryan.

06:46.743 --> 06:49.648
Now this way.

06:49.716 --> 06:51.083
Now down here.

06:51.151 --> 06:52.217
Now up here, Ryan.

06:53.652 --> 06:56.253
Now down here.

06:56.321 --> 06:58.988
Ryan, the answers
you seek are straight ahead.

06:59.056 --> 07:01.322
I can sense it.

07:02.692 --> 07:04.993
Drew, hold up.

07:06.394 --> 07:08.596
Uh... yeah.

07:08.664 --> 07:10.065
You don't need that. The...

07:10.133 --> 07:11.865
Your god knows
exactly where he's going.

07:11.933 --> 07:14.066
It's-it's this way.
Where are we headed?

07:14.134 --> 07:16.468
Well, there's a gorge that's
supposed to be pretty cool.

07:16.536 --> 07:19.205
According to this,
it's just north of here.

07:19.273 --> 07:21.742
I'll just use this and
find out which way north is.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.379
North is that way.
It's that way.

07:23.447 --> 07:25.549
I told you that already.
How do you know?

07:25.617 --> 07:30.522
Oh, moss grows on the, uh,
north side of trees.

07:30.590 --> 07:32.392
Are you sure?

07:32.459 --> 07:34.694
(laughing): Bro, I was a
Boy Scout for eight years.

07:34.762 --> 07:38.132
Which means nothing, except he's
almost certainly been molested.

07:38.200 --> 07:40.502
Huh. You're right.

07:40.570 --> 07:42.438
Lucky guess.

07:42.506 --> 07:44.507
Put your phone away, bro.
Why'd you even bring it?

07:44.575 --> 07:45.975
Enjoy nature.

07:52.351 --> 07:55.819
Yeah, yeah, I guess
we can... go that way.

07:55.887 --> 07:58.051
I mean, it's the longer,
less happy route,

07:58.119 --> 07:59.386
but, hey, what the hell?

07:59.453 --> 08:02.622
It's your life.

08:02.690 --> 08:06.158
So, what's going on, man?
You dating anybody?

08:06.226 --> 08:07.792
Me? No.

08:07.860 --> 08:10.195
I'm just so busy...
with work.

08:10.263 --> 08:12.263
Oh, you know what?

08:12.331 --> 08:14.798
There's this girl that
Jenna went to college with.

08:14.866 --> 08:17.599
She's out here,
she is smoking hot, man.

08:17.667 --> 08:19.534
I mean, I should
get you her number.

08:19.602 --> 08:21.434
I don't really...
Oh, look at that.

08:21.502 --> 08:23.001
What?

08:23.068 --> 08:25.136
The fungus on that tree there.

08:25.204 --> 08:28.473
It's a bay-brown
polypore.

08:28.541 --> 08:30.708
I'm gonna go kick
the shit out of it.

08:32.443 --> 08:34.078
Oh, God.

08:34.145 --> 08:35.881
Please, just call me
Wilfred? Yeah?

08:35.948 --> 08:38.715
Drew just tried to set me up
with one of Jenna's friends.

08:38.783 --> 08:40.082
Like I would ever do that.

08:40.150 --> 08:41.884
This is so awkward.

08:41.952 --> 08:43.986
Eyes on the prize, Ryan.

08:44.054 --> 08:46.922
The quicker we find that gorge,
the quicker this torture ends.

08:46.990 --> 08:49.156
You're just lucky you've got
me here to guide you.

08:49.224 --> 08:51.025
No, I'm lucky I brought this.

08:51.093 --> 08:53.397
Yeah, but can that show you
how to find food

08:53.464 --> 08:55.098
so you don't starve to death?

08:55.166 --> 08:57.134
I brought granola bars.

08:57.201 --> 09:00.137
Yeah, they'd be good if you
didn't have a gluten allergy.

09:00.204 --> 09:01.671
Which I don't.

09:01.739 --> 09:03.338
Yeah, but what if you did?

09:03.406 --> 09:06.140
You need to learn how to
live off the land... like me.

09:08.878 --> 09:11.379
Last time I ate these,
I almost died.

09:11.447 --> 09:12.814
So, you're gonna eat 'em again?

09:27.232 --> 09:30.301
(retching)

09:30.369 --> 09:31.636
(sniffles)

09:31.704 --> 09:34.173
Let's do this.

09:37.443 --> 09:39.479
(owl hooting)

09:39.547 --> 09:41.318
Hey, Ryan,
can I ask you something?

09:41.385 --> 09:42.953
Sure.

09:43.020 --> 09:44.652
Have you noticed

09:44.720 --> 09:48.153
Jenna acting kind of
different lately?

09:48.221 --> 09:50.658
No.

09:50.726 --> 09:53.092
Yeah, it's...

09:53.160 --> 09:55.663
it's just, she hasn't
been herself.

09:55.731 --> 09:58.666
The home security thing,

09:58.734 --> 10:01.267
and then her problems
with you and Wilfred,

10:01.335 --> 10:05.241
and she's been falling asleep
on the couch almost every night.

10:05.309 --> 10:08.275
I'd really
rather not get involved.

10:08.343 --> 10:09.877
(sighing):
I know.

10:09.944 --> 10:11.580
This is something
I gotta fix by myself.

10:13.083 --> 10:15.019
I actually wrote a song for her.

10:15.087 --> 10:16.552
You know me.

10:16.620 --> 10:18.053
It's always easier

10:18.121 --> 10:19.682
to express my feelings
through my music.

10:19.688 --> 10:23.093
I... did-didn't
know that about you.

10:23.160 --> 10:26.259
♪ That's 'cause you don't
pay enough attention to me ♪

10:26.326 --> 10:29.697
♪ And that hurts me. ♪

10:29.765 --> 10:32.033
See what I mean?

10:32.100 --> 10:34.599
You mind giving it a listen?

10:34.667 --> 10:36.735
(owl hooting)

10:38.940 --> 10:41.277
Sure.

10:41.345 --> 10:43.946
♪ You used to smile ♪

10:44.014 --> 10:47.150
♪ When you saw me ♪

10:47.218 --> 10:50.019
♪ You used to ask me ♪

10:50.087 --> 10:52.823
♪ 'Bout my day ♪

10:54.426 --> 10:57.463
♪ But lately
you've been distant ♪

10:57.531 --> 11:01.769
♪ And I just don't know
what words to say except ♪

11:01.837 --> 11:06.641
♪ Nothing's changed for me ♪

11:06.709 --> 11:10.345
♪ And I hope ♪

11:10.413 --> 11:16.119
♪ I hope I'm not to blame. ♪

11:17.322 --> 11:19.223
Jenna's gonna love that.

11:19.292 --> 11:23.760
I hope so, man.

11:23.828 --> 11:26.064
(heavy breathing)

11:30.570 --> 11:33.240
Come on. We've got
a big day ahead of us.

11:33.309 --> 11:34.841
(grunts)

11:38.380 --> 11:39.947
Drew...

11:40.015 --> 11:41.683
did-did you move my backpack?

11:41.751 --> 11:45.187
It-it was here,
and now it's gone.

11:45.254 --> 11:47.223
What was in it?
Everything.

11:47.290 --> 11:49.601
My-my phone,
the map, our food...

11:49.721 --> 11:50.827
Food?

11:50.895 --> 11:53.297
A bear might've gotten it.

11:53.364 --> 11:56.269
Oh, man.

11:56.338 --> 11:57.774
A bear was here.

11:57.841 --> 12:00.578
It knocked my guitar
in the fire.

12:02.779 --> 12:05.717
(quietly): You stole my backpack, didn't you?
Why would I do that?

12:05.784 --> 12:08.304
So I'd have no choice but to rely
on you to bring me to the place

12:08.321 --> 12:10.488
from the photo.
I didn't do it, Ryan. I swear.

12:10.556 --> 12:13.091
Oh, so you had nothing to do
with Drew's guitar either?

12:13.158 --> 12:16.629
Obviously I did that, yeah,
but not your backpack.

12:16.696 --> 12:19.232
Ryan, this is a sign.

12:19.300 --> 12:22.436
Without that map, your only
hope of finding answers is me.

12:22.504 --> 12:25.839
It's time to put your faith
in me and follow me blindly.

12:25.907 --> 12:29.843
Drew, can you get us
to that gorge without the map?

12:29.910 --> 12:32.412
Is a badger's musk soapy
and cream-colored?

12:37.623 --> 12:39.790
Well, here's your gorge.

12:39.858 --> 12:41.490
You were right.

12:41.558 --> 12:43.992
The view is sweet.

12:45.497 --> 12:49.898
I wonder what used to be here.

12:53.934 --> 12:56.601
RYAN:
There's nothing here.

12:56.669 --> 12:58.835
Drew may have been
able to find this place,

12:58.903 --> 13:01.570
but only I can
lead you to answers.

13:01.638 --> 13:03.405
Shh!

13:03.473 --> 13:06.074
Something...

13:06.142 --> 13:08.843
is telling me the
answers you seek...

13:08.911 --> 13:10.646
are in the ground.

13:10.714 --> 13:13.418
Wilfred, stop. Just give it up.
I'm serious.

13:19.891 --> 13:24.364
There's something important
right here under our feet.

13:28.105 --> 13:29.036
(chuckles)

13:29.104 --> 13:31.237
What did I tell you?

13:31.304 --> 13:34.506
What is it?

13:34.574 --> 13:37.412
It has an energy to it.

13:37.480 --> 13:39.478
(exhales)

13:39.546 --> 13:44.086
It must be some sort of...
sacred, magical artifact.

13:44.154 --> 13:46.860
I bet this belonged to the cult.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.832
At last!

13:51.900 --> 13:54.734
I bring you...

13:54.802 --> 13:56.537
happiness!

13:56.605 --> 13:58.172
(buzzing) Aah!
(shouting)

13:58.240 --> 14:00.910
Wilfred, no! Ow! No!
I'll kill you!

14:00.978 --> 14:01.978
I'll kill you! Aah!

14:02.045 --> 14:03.913
I'll kill you! Aah!

14:03.980 --> 14:05.747
I'll kill you! Aah!

14:05.815 --> 14:07.750
Wilfred, run!
(shouting)

14:09.522 --> 14:12.588
(both shouting)

14:12.655 --> 14:14.324
Whoa-whoa... aah!

14:16.595 --> 14:17.830
(Drew yelling)
Drew!

14:17.897 --> 14:18.897
Oh, my God.

14:18.965 --> 14:20.664
Okay, I realize this looks bad.

14:20.732 --> 14:24.238
But in my defense, my job isn't
to lead Drew to happiness.

14:24.307 --> 14:26.340
(bees buzzing)

14:29.155 --> 14:31.511
Drew! Are you okay?!

14:31.631 --> 14:34.196
It's not that bad!
I can handle it!

14:34.935 --> 14:38.205
Oh! Oh, it's bad!

14:38.272 --> 14:40.974
It's bad! I think I see bone!

14:41.094 --> 14:45.012
Wait, so you have bones
on the inside of your bodies?

14:45.080 --> 14:46.979
This changes everything.

14:47.046 --> 14:48.613
What should I do?

14:48.680 --> 14:50.047
Oh, I see, so I make one mistake

14:50.114 --> 14:51.948
and you're no longer
consulting me?

14:52.016 --> 14:55.284
The first rule when you're in
trouble in the wilderness

14:55.352 --> 14:59.185
is to stay put
and stay together.

14:59.253 --> 15:02.224
That's two rules, Boy Scout!

15:02.292 --> 15:03.692
I texted Jenna from the road!

15:03.760 --> 15:04.993
She knows where we are.

15:05.060 --> 15:06.794
When we don't come home,

15:06.862 --> 15:10.331
she'll call the police
and someone will rescue us.

15:10.398 --> 15:12.098
No one's finding us
all the way out here.

15:12.166 --> 15:13.968
We're gonna have to hike back
for help.

15:14.036 --> 15:17.775
Drew, that doesn't
look very good!

15:17.842 --> 15:20.512
You could die out here!
I'm hiking back for help!

15:20.580 --> 15:23.382
Yes! In your face!

15:23.450 --> 15:25.218
Oh, I'm not gonna die, Ryan.

15:25.285 --> 15:27.189
Worst case scenario,

15:27.257 --> 15:29.628
I lose my leg.

15:29.697 --> 15:33.028
Okay! You know what?
You should go!

15:33.096 --> 15:35.460
Go!

15:35.528 --> 15:37.195
Ryan, my god instincts
are telling me

15:37.263 --> 15:38.303
we should've made a turn...

15:38.332 --> 15:40.102
I don't care what you think.

15:40.169 --> 15:43.242
If it weren't for you, I'd be
hiking alone back to my...

15:43.309 --> 15:44.945
Whoa.
Hey.

15:45.013 --> 15:46.546
You don't look so good.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.580
Shit, my eyes are swollen shut.

15:48.648 --> 15:51.051
Wilfred, I can barely see.

15:51.119 --> 15:53.920
Y-You're gonna have to help me
get back to my car.

15:53.988 --> 15:55.789
Finally! It's about time
you let me take the lead.

15:55.857 --> 15:56.990
Here, take my tail.

15:58.292 --> 16:00.591
Oh! Gross!
(chuckles)

16:00.659 --> 16:02.327
Sorry, I couldn't resist.

16:02.394 --> 16:04.229
Here. Here it is.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.869
Really?! Twice?
(chuckles)

16:06.937 --> 16:08.336
Just give me your goddamn tail!
All right,

16:08.404 --> 16:10.004
all right.

16:11.841 --> 16:13.844
And you wonder why I don't
think you're a god.

16:13.912 --> 16:15.313
If gods can't have
a sense of humor,

16:15.380 --> 16:17.013
how do you explain
Stephen Hawking?

16:17.081 --> 16:19.215
Okay, we're about to go
under a fallen tree here.

16:19.282 --> 16:21.519
You're gonna have to
duck really low now.

16:21.587 --> 16:22.886
That's it.

16:22.954 --> 16:24.654
That's it.

16:24.721 --> 16:26.601
Right there.
(chuckles) Oh, goddamn it, Wilfred!

16:29.394 --> 16:31.162
What's going on?

16:31.229 --> 16:32.696
Why are we stopping?

16:32.763 --> 16:34.564
There's something weird
going on.

16:34.632 --> 16:36.665
Every time I ask the universe
to lead me to your happiness,

16:36.733 --> 16:38.966
we end up in the same spot.

16:39.034 --> 16:41.701
So we're lost?
We're not lost-- I know exactly where we are.

16:41.769 --> 16:43.602
Then why don't you take me back
to my car?

16:43.669 --> 16:45.802
Is it because you want Drew
to die?

16:45.870 --> 16:48.371
That's it, isn't it?
You want him to die

16:48.438 --> 16:50.874
because he knew how to get us to the
place in the photo and you didn't.

16:50.942 --> 16:52.609
Please.
If anyone here has a motive

16:52.676 --> 16:54.343
to let Drew die, it's you.

16:54.411 --> 16:57.045
Me? Why would I want him to die?
Because you don't

16:57.112 --> 16:58.748
want him to find out
you kissed Jenna.

16:58.816 --> 17:00.416
Jenna kissed me!

17:00.484 --> 17:01.833
DREW:
What?!

17:01.953 --> 17:04.851
Jenna kissed you?!

17:04.919 --> 17:07.523
I told you I knew where we were.

17:13.885 --> 17:15.319
(indistinct radio communication)

17:15.387 --> 17:17.957
(Jenna speaks quietly)

17:18.025 --> 17:20.294
Leave me alone, Jenna.

17:45.271 --> 17:46.537
Drew...

17:46.605 --> 17:48.573
where are you going?
(grunts)

17:48.641 --> 17:51.676
Back to Wisconsin.

17:51.744 --> 17:55.447
Listen, I'm so sorry about...
No. Stop, man.

17:55.515 --> 17:57.617
It's not your fault.
I mean, if...

17:57.685 --> 18:00.019
things were good
between me and Jenna,

18:00.087 --> 18:02.788
she never would've kissed you.

18:02.856 --> 18:07.160
I guess I've had a feeling
for a while now

18:07.228 --> 18:10.696
that she wasn't in love
with me anymore, and...

18:10.764 --> 18:13.031
(wry laugh):
now it all makes sense.

18:13.099 --> 18:14.565
Take care, bro.

18:16.934 --> 18:18.535
(door shuts)

18:20.972 --> 18:24.139
Well, what are you
waiting for, mate?

18:24.207 --> 18:27.512
Did you... do all of this
to lead me to Jenna?

18:27.580 --> 18:29.548
If I did,
would it make you happy?

18:29.616 --> 18:32.514
No. I didn't want
to hurt anyone.

18:32.582 --> 18:34.820
I merely cleared some branches

18:34.888 --> 18:37.959
so you could see the path.

18:51.507 --> 18:53.743
Jenna?

18:59.848 --> 19:01.951
What are you doing?
I'm going to Wisconsin.

19:02.018 --> 19:05.521
I'm gonna try
to work things out with Drew.

19:05.589 --> 19:07.187
Does he know you're coming?

19:07.255 --> 19:09.490
No, but... I have to try.

19:09.557 --> 19:12.261
Jenna, I-I'm sorry.

19:12.329 --> 19:14.263
You're sorry?

19:14.331 --> 19:17.232
You ruined my marriage, Ryan.

19:17.300 --> 19:18.820
You know, I don't...
I don't want to...

19:18.836 --> 19:21.772
I don't want to get into this
with you right now.

19:21.840 --> 19:25.077
The least you can do is watch
Wilfred for me while I'm gone.

19:25.145 --> 19:26.914
Yeah.

19:26.982 --> 19:29.250
No problem.

19:34.658 --> 19:35.991
(phone ringing)

19:41.099 --> 19:42.332
Hello?

19:42.400 --> 19:44.199
MAN:
Ryan Newman?

19:44.267 --> 19:45.632
Yes. Who is this?

19:45.700 --> 19:48.033
You don't need to worry
about who I am.

19:48.101 --> 19:50.034
How did you get my number?

19:50.102 --> 19:52.268
From your phone.

19:52.336 --> 19:54.603
You stole my bag.

19:54.670 --> 19:55.570
That's right.

19:55.638 --> 19:56.571
And I'll do a lot worse

19:56.638 --> 19:58.472
if you ever come up here again.

19:58.539 --> 20:00.875
Tell your dad's partner
the price just doubled.

20:00.943 --> 20:02.677
Ten thousand.

20:02.745 --> 20:04.942
That bitch will know
what I'm talking about.
