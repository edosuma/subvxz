WEBVTT

02:52.088 --> 02:55.716
I don't wanna alarm you
but Garland has disappeared before.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.343
Granted it's always been work-related.

02:59.387 --> 03:02.472
Agent Cooper,
did this seem work-related?

03:04.225 --> 03:07.144
- Ma'am, that's hard to say.
- Mm.

03:07.312 --> 03:13.442
So, Betty, you're saying this behavior
is part of the way the major operates.

03:13.610 --> 03:14.902
Let me ask you this.

03:15.820 --> 03:18.864
Did he leave suddenly?

03:19.073 --> 03:20.240
Yes, he did.

03:21.075 --> 03:22.409
We were speaking philosophically,

03:22.619 --> 03:25.370
and I left the campsite
to answer the call of nature.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.080
When I returned he was gone.

03:28.875 --> 03:31.752
The fact that you were in the woods
is very significant.

03:32.378 --> 03:33.670
In what way?

03:37.217 --> 03:39.259
Confidentially,

03:39.761 --> 03:42.638
he talks about them constantly.

03:44.724 --> 03:47.976
Ma'am, has the major, uh...

03:48.144 --> 03:50.896
Clearly, a man
of no small spiritual advancement.

03:51.105 --> 03:55.567
- been attempting to contact
some element that lives in the woods

03:55.902 --> 03:58.362
as a part of his top-secret work?

03:59.739 --> 04:01.365
That's classified.

04:03.534 --> 04:08.163
Well, he certainly has a renaissance
passion for exploration, doesn't he?

04:09.958 --> 04:12.125
That is how he sees himself.

04:13.670 --> 04:16.296
And there's no manual for it.

04:16.506 --> 04:19.258
There's certainly no manual
to be married to it.

04:22.178 --> 04:23.512
Betty, thanks for coming in.

04:24.347 --> 04:26.890
I guess there's not much more
we can do right now,

04:27.058 --> 04:28.517
except, keep our eyes peeled.

04:30.728 --> 04:33.939
Uh, Garland left some notes
on his bedside table.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.607
I can call you back with them.

04:35.858 --> 04:37.192
They might be very helpful.

04:45.535 --> 04:48.996
Harry, the major didn't just wander off
on some work-related assignment.

04:49.205 --> 04:54.084
That flash of light I saw, it's a powerful
force that exists in those woods.

04:57.714 --> 05:00.882
Sheriff, we found Mr.
and Mrs. Milford's wedding present.

05:01.092 --> 05:05.429
It's a matching scarf and ascot set.

05:05.847 --> 05:09.558
Good.
I still owe him a gift from last time.

05:09.892 --> 05:12.477
I can't believe
that he's getting married again.

05:12.687 --> 05:16.648
Dougie's weddings are a seasonal
thing. Like the return of the salmon.

05:17.525 --> 05:20.110
Marry in haste, repent in leisure.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.863
Hello, sheriff?

05:23.031 --> 05:24.948
There's a call for a Dale Crewper.

05:25.575 --> 05:28.910
Long distance. I hope I didn't cut it off.

05:29.120 --> 05:32.622
Temp. Lucy's helping out
with the Milford wedding.

05:33.082 --> 05:34.708
- Hmm.
- Coop?

05:34.876 --> 05:36.668
Where are we?

05:36.878 --> 05:40.047
This is Gordon Cole calling
from Bend, Oregon.

05:40.298 --> 05:41.590
How are you doing, Gordon?

05:41.758 --> 05:44.843
Coop, I just called to say
that you have my full support

05:45.011 --> 05:46.678
in this investigation business.

05:48.306 --> 05:51.141
These are hard times
but we get through them.

05:51.392 --> 05:54.519
- Thank you, Gordon.
- It ranks poor with me too.

05:55.313 --> 05:58.106
Now, Coop, is any of this true?

05:58.316 --> 05:59.900
Double homicide?

06:00.234 --> 06:01.985
Stolen drugs?

06:02.195 --> 06:03.737
Storming a whorehouse?

06:03.946 --> 06:05.447
It's all a bunch of hogwash.

06:05.656 --> 06:07.991
I have to tell you
the Drug Enforcement Agency

06:08.159 --> 06:09.534
is starting to nose around.

06:10.286 --> 06:13.997
They're sending down a top dog
to investigate the drug angle.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.041
Who are they sending?

06:18.961 --> 06:20.337
It's Gordon.

06:21.005 --> 06:22.464
It's Gordon Cole.

06:23.049 --> 06:25.175
- Who's the agent?
- Oh!

06:25.343 --> 06:26.676
Dennis Bryson.

06:26.886 --> 06:29.554
It's Bryson. He's a good man, Harry.
No nonsense.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.890
Don't let him rattle you, Coop.

06:32.308 --> 06:35.977
These guys make a living looking
through other people's drawers.

06:36.187 --> 06:38.647
We've all had our socks
tossed around.

06:38.856 --> 06:41.400
From time to time.

06:41.609 --> 06:44.027
Couple of words of advice:

06:44.237 --> 06:46.655
Let a smile be your umbrella.

06:47.198 --> 06:48.990
- Thanks, Gordon.
- See you, Coop.

06:50.284 --> 06:51.326
Well, Harry...

06:55.248 --> 06:57.541
...time to face the music.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.174
Good morning, Roger.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.135
Gentlemen.

07:10.012 --> 07:11.054
Agent Cooper.

07:11.764 --> 07:13.223
It's showtime.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.641
You've heard the charges.

07:15.351 --> 07:18.103
What do you wish to present
as your defense?

07:18.312 --> 07:19.855
I have no defense.

07:21.649 --> 07:25.110
I am completely confident
in the rightness of my actions.

07:25.319 --> 07:29.406
Some of it occurred outside of Bureau
guidelines, I will pay the price for that.

07:29.657 --> 07:31.908
But I'm innocent
of any criminal wrongdoing.

07:32.118 --> 07:35.537
If they wish to charge me,
I will defend myself in a court of law.

07:42.879 --> 07:44.713
Dale.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.966
There's a right way and a wrong way
to do this.

07:49.093 --> 07:50.886
And the first thing we expect

07:51.095 --> 07:54.347
is a Bureau man
to stand up for himself.

07:54.849 --> 07:58.685
A man who can't,
who doesn't even try,

07:59.562 --> 08:04.191
well, he may be packing feathers
where his spine is supposed to be.

08:06.360 --> 08:08.028
Roger.

08:08.237 --> 08:10.989
I know the moves
I'm supposed to make.

08:11.199 --> 08:12.407
And I know the board.

08:12.742 --> 08:14.242
So.

08:14.660 --> 08:17.204
I've been doing
a lot of thinking lately.

08:17.747 --> 08:22.250
And I've started to focus out
beyond the edge of the board.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.628
At a bigger game.

08:25.838 --> 08:26.963
What game?

08:29.342 --> 08:32.594
The sound wind makes
through the pines.

08:33.554 --> 08:35.013
The sentience of animals.

08:36.349 --> 08:41.269
What we fear in the dark
and what lies beyond the darkness.

08:41.521 --> 08:44.397
What the hell are you talking about?

08:49.403 --> 08:53.114
I'm talking about seeing
beyond fear, Roger.

08:53.282 --> 08:55.784
About looking at the world with love.

08:56.327 --> 09:00.038
They're liable to extradite you
for murder and drug trafficking.

09:01.874 --> 09:04.459
These are things I cannot control.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.967
The suspension will remain in force.

09:12.426 --> 09:14.678
The next move is up to the Canadian
government

09:14.845 --> 09:18.056
and the DEA investigation
which begins today.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.476
You've cracked a big case.

09:22.353 --> 09:24.062
You've been under a lot of pressure.

09:24.897 --> 09:26.940
I may recommend

09:27.149 --> 09:29.317
a full psychological workup.

09:30.319 --> 09:32.737
Thanks for your candor, Roger.

09:33.447 --> 09:35.532
So long, fellas.

10:07.648 --> 10:09.899
Donna, hi.

10:10.109 --> 10:11.484
Hi, Nadine.

10:11.652 --> 10:13.320
Have you heard anything from James?

10:13.904 --> 10:16.031
You mean, Eddie's friend
with the motorcycle?

10:16.657 --> 10:17.699
Yeah.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.868
He hasn't been around
for a couple of days.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.119
Listen,

10:21.287 --> 10:24.956
I gotta ask you something and I hope
you don't think this is too personal.

10:25.708 --> 10:26.750
What?

10:26.959 --> 10:31.588
Well, are you still, like, going out
with Mike or anything?

10:32.340 --> 10:33.423
No.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.759
Yay!

10:36.344 --> 10:39.137
- Why?
- You have to promise not to say.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.431
- Promise, okay?
- Sure.

10:41.724 --> 10:45.685
Well, I think there may be
some major chemistry developing bet...

10:47.104 --> 10:49.439
Oh, my God, there he is.

10:50.358 --> 10:51.608
Hi, Donna.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.486
Hi, Mike.

10:59.950 --> 11:03.119
He has the cutest buns.

11:04.705 --> 11:08.124
Nadine, what about Ed?

11:08.334 --> 11:11.002
Aren't you still seeing him?

11:11.504 --> 11:13.213
Yeah, sort of.

11:14.465 --> 11:18.927
Well, if you're still seeing Ed,
then how can you...

11:19.136 --> 11:20.970
...how can you start seeing Mike?

11:22.598 --> 11:25.767
Well, Eddie stays home
and Mike's at school.

11:25.935 --> 11:28.353
Eddie likes to stay in,
Mike likes to go out.

11:28.562 --> 11:31.272
And let's be realistic,
sometimes Eddie acts like

11:31.440 --> 11:32.691
he's old enough to be my father.

11:34.026 --> 11:35.068
I'll catch you later.

12:15.818 --> 12:17.819
Could I get a beer?

12:18.946 --> 12:21.531
- Hi.
- Hello.

12:21.907 --> 12:23.450
Headed somewhere?

12:23.659 --> 12:24.951
I'm sorry?

12:25.202 --> 12:28.997
Is there some place you're going to
or running from?

12:31.917 --> 12:34.002
You got the wrong guy. I'm all right.

12:34.253 --> 12:36.296
Men are always all right.

12:36.547 --> 12:38.965
Right up until they pull the trigger.

12:39.216 --> 12:41.634
And then we watch the neighbors
solemnly march out

12:41.802 --> 12:43.762
to the news cameras to tell us:

12:43.971 --> 12:47.056
"He was such a nice, quiet guy."

12:48.184 --> 12:50.685
Well, I'm only quiet on the outside.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.521
I can almost hear what's inside
from here.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.068
Live nearby?

12:59.904 --> 13:02.113
Yeah, Twin Peaks.

13:05.868 --> 13:06.910
It's a nice jacket.

13:08.496 --> 13:10.622
I'm glad you think so.

13:11.081 --> 13:13.750
- Look, can you do anything with cars?
- Yeah.

13:14.084 --> 13:16.294
Why, you got a problem with
the 'Vette outside?

13:16.504 --> 13:19.297
No. No, it's my husband's Jaguar.

13:19.507 --> 13:23.635
Somebody squeezed me on
the highway, and I drove it to a ditch.

13:24.428 --> 13:28.640
I think it would be a very good idea to
have it repaired before he gets home.

13:28.849 --> 13:31.100
Well, I could take a look at it.

13:31.310 --> 13:32.894
My name is James.

13:33.103 --> 13:34.687
Evelyn.

13:34.939 --> 13:37.524
Evelyn Marsh.
I live right up the road.

13:39.193 --> 13:41.027
Well, are we in a hurry?

13:44.698 --> 13:46.616
Do you mind if I play the box first?

13:48.369 --> 13:50.662
I don't exactly punch a clock myself.

14:41.505 --> 14:43.381
Good day, Dick.

14:43.591 --> 14:45.341
Hello, Andy.

14:45.593 --> 14:51.347
This is little Nicky, my charge
from Happy Helping Hand.

14:51.557 --> 14:54.434
Nicky, this is Deputy Andy.

14:55.102 --> 14:56.769
How do you do, young fella?

14:57.521 --> 14:59.063
- Hi.
- Heh, heh.

14:59.815 --> 15:00.857
Andrew, old boy.

15:01.191 --> 15:03.902
Little Nicky and myself, we just came
from Horne's Department Store

15:04.069 --> 15:06.154
where Nicky was fitted
for a new wardrobe.

15:06.363 --> 15:08.197
And now we're on our way
for a malted.

15:08.407 --> 15:10.700
We were hoping Lucy could come
with us.

15:11.035 --> 15:13.828
Oh, shoot, Dick.
Lucy's up at the Great Northern,

15:13.996 --> 15:15.371
helping with the Milford wedding.

15:16.248 --> 15:17.874
Oh, God, that's right.

15:18.083 --> 15:20.043
Dougie's getting married again.

15:21.462 --> 15:23.171
Lucy's not here?

15:23.380 --> 15:25.381
Does this mean we can't go out
for a malted?

15:25.633 --> 15:28.885
Yes, unfortunately.
We'll have to go some other time.

15:29.094 --> 15:33.097
- But you promised. Can't we go?
- Ah... Nicky. Ha-ha-ha.

15:34.224 --> 15:35.266
You know, Dick,

15:35.601 --> 15:37.644
it's close to my lunch hour.

15:38.729 --> 15:43.358
If you'd like, Nicky, I'd sure enjoy
taking you two guys out for a malted.

15:43.567 --> 15:46.402
- How would that be?
- Oh, boy.

15:57.247 --> 15:58.289
So, what will you do

15:58.916 --> 16:00.917
if we can't figure a way
to get you cleared?

16:01.168 --> 16:05.588
Well, Harry, the Giant said a path is
formed by laying one stone at a time.

16:08.300 --> 16:11.219
Have either of you fellas heard
of a place called the White Lodge?

16:14.807 --> 16:15.974
Where did you hear of it?

16:17.351 --> 16:20.395
Well, it was the last thing Major Briggs
said to me before he disappeared.

16:21.480 --> 16:24.649
Cooper, you may be fearless
in this world.

16:24.858 --> 16:26.442
But there are other worlds.

16:28.862 --> 16:30.655
Tell me more.

16:31.365 --> 16:34.826
My people believe that
the White Lodge is a place

16:34.994 --> 16:38.496
where the spirits that rule
man and nature here reside.

16:39.248 --> 16:42.041
Local legend. Goes way back.

16:43.252 --> 16:46.129
There is also a legend of a place
called the Black Lodge,

16:46.338 --> 16:48.423
the shadow self of the White Lodge.

16:48.924 --> 16:52.844
Legend says that every spirit
must pass through there

16:53.012 --> 16:55.263
on a way to perfection.

16:55.597 --> 16:59.976
There, you will meet
your own shadow self.

17:00.185 --> 17:03.312
My people call it: The Dweller
on the Threshold.

17:04.356 --> 17:06.190
Dweller on the Threshold.

17:06.400 --> 17:11.612
But it is said, if you confront the
Black Lodge with imperfect courage,

17:12.114 --> 17:15.158
it will utterly annihilate your soul.

17:15.993 --> 17:17.410
Agent Cooper,

17:17.578 --> 17:19.829
Agent Bryson's here to see you.

17:19.997 --> 17:21.039
Send him right in.

17:21.915 --> 17:23.916
Dennis Bryson and I worked together
in Oakland.

17:24.710 --> 17:27.920
One of the finest minds in the DEA.
Harry, we're in very good hands.

17:32.301 --> 17:34.010
Coop.

17:35.804 --> 17:37.472
Dennis?

17:40.017 --> 17:44.270
It's a long story, but actually
I prefer Denise if you don't mind.

17:45.606 --> 17:47.148
Okay.

17:47.775 --> 17:48.816
Sheriff Truman.

17:49.485 --> 17:50.902
- Pleased.
- Deputy Hawk.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.822
Denise Bryson,
Drug Enforcement Agency.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.785
Well, I had a nice ride out here,
sheriff.

17:58.994 --> 18:01.079
It's hard to imagine
you have even any crime.

18:01.288 --> 18:05.333
I picture you chasing lost dogs,
and locking up the town drunk.

18:06.001 --> 18:08.711
Unfortunately, it's a little more
involved than that.

18:08.879 --> 18:09.962
Hmm.

18:10.130 --> 18:11.506
Let's get right to this, Dale.

18:11.715 --> 18:16.094
The DEA's interest in you stems from
allegations made by an RCMP officer

18:16.303 --> 18:19.222
that you stole drugs being used
by him in a sting operation.

18:20.015 --> 18:21.974
Denise, I believe I'm being set up.

18:22.351 --> 18:27.313
Well, my recent experiences taught me
never to judge too quickly.

18:31.193 --> 18:32.527
Anyway, I'll get right to this

18:32.694 --> 18:35.238
- and get back to you later.
- Okay.

18:35.447 --> 18:37.657
I understand we're both staying
at the Great Northern.

18:37.866 --> 18:38.950
How is the food up there?

18:39.493 --> 18:42.036
Denise, you're in for a real surprise.

18:42.788 --> 18:43.830
So are they.

18:45.624 --> 18:46.874
Well, we'll catch up later.

18:47.084 --> 18:51.045
- I wanna tell you all about my new life.
- Anxious to hear about it.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.464
It's a pleasure to meet you, sheriff.

18:54.842 --> 18:55.967
Mm.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.176
Deputy.

19:07.563 --> 19:09.355
That's a good color for him.

19:52.107 --> 19:54.192
Look, is there something
you want?

19:54.526 --> 19:56.027
Why, Mike.

19:56.236 --> 19:58.112
Aren't we being a little forward?

19:59.489 --> 20:03.659
Come on, guys. I wanna hear
some grunting and see some sweat.

20:04.286 --> 20:07.121
Attaboy, Nelson.
Come on, pump it.

20:07.331 --> 20:09.332
Pump it.

20:13.378 --> 20:16.255
- Hey, what's your name, little lady?
- Nadine Butler.

20:16.465 --> 20:20.593
Well, Nadine, ever give any thoughts
of going out for the wrestling team?

21:31.832 --> 21:33.332
Josie.

21:34.501 --> 21:36.168
It's time.

21:40.382 --> 21:43.342
I can't be with you unless I know.

21:44.636 --> 21:48.014
- Oh, Harry.
- The truth.

21:54.938 --> 21:56.814
The truth.

22:00.360 --> 22:05.031
I used to... work for a man
in Hong Kong.

22:06.116 --> 22:09.201
His name is Thomas Eckhardt.

22:11.038 --> 22:13.497
He helped me.

22:16.543 --> 22:19.795
Took me off the streets
when I was 16.

22:22.299 --> 22:24.633
We are from a poor family.

22:24.843 --> 22:28.220
Sometimes they sell
their female children.

22:28.430 --> 22:30.306
I was lucky.

22:33.393 --> 22:35.728
He taught me about life...

22:36.146 --> 22:38.147
...about business.

22:39.024 --> 22:41.150
He was my father.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.277
My master.

22:44.738 --> 22:46.113
My lover.

22:48.492 --> 22:51.786
When I met Andrew Packard,

22:51.995 --> 22:55.206
I was already afraid for my life.

22:55.582 --> 22:58.459
Andrew was also
a business partner.

23:00.295 --> 23:03.005
When Andrew asked me to marry him,

23:03.215 --> 23:04.548
I said yes.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.720
Who was this Mr. Lee?

23:09.971 --> 23:12.348
Who is this... this cousin?

23:12.557 --> 23:14.683
I'm sorry, Harry.

23:14.893 --> 23:17.353
I was just trying
to keep you out of this.

23:17.562 --> 23:21.065
- The less you know, the better.
- Who was he?

23:22.943 --> 23:24.860
He works for Eckhardt.

23:25.070 --> 23:29.657
He said if I didn't go back with him,
he'd kill you.

23:32.202 --> 23:33.911
Why?

23:34.621 --> 23:37.540
Because Eckhardt wants me.

23:37.791 --> 23:41.419
He's never stopped wanting me.
He thinks I'm his property.

23:41.878 --> 23:45.172
When Andrew was alive,
he could protect me.

23:47.592 --> 23:49.593
I now believe...

23:49.928 --> 23:55.182
...Eckhardt is the man
responsible for Andrew's death.

23:57.436 --> 24:02.565
We were... We were in the airport
in Seattle.

24:02.774 --> 24:05.151
And I just escaped.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.321
I'd rather die.

24:10.866 --> 24:13.409
I'd rather die than go back
to that monster.

24:13.618 --> 24:15.536
Josie.

24:16.413 --> 24:20.040
Josie, you will never have
to go back there.

24:20.250 --> 24:22.376
You're with me now...

24:22.586 --> 24:24.044
And now...

24:24.254 --> 24:26.881
...he'll kill the both of us.

24:28.258 --> 24:30.217
No.

24:37.809 --> 24:39.768
Let him try.

24:54.951 --> 24:56.160
Sorry, it took so long,

24:56.369 --> 24:58.913
- but we're short on help today.
- That's quite all right.

24:59.206 --> 25:02.875
I've been looking forward to this pie.
I've heard so much about it.

25:03.418 --> 25:04.960
You won't be disappointed.

25:07.547 --> 25:10.758
Hey, I... I'll get you anything
you want. Just sit down.

25:10.967 --> 25:13.719
Hey, sweetheart.
Could we get some coffee?

25:13.929 --> 25:17.389
- How was your hunting expedition?
- It was a little fatiguing.

25:23.605 --> 25:26.023
- Catch anything?
- I hope not.

25:27.442 --> 25:29.568
Oh, catch anything. Uh...

25:29.736 --> 25:31.946
Yeah, I...

25:32.155 --> 25:36.825
I came across a 12-point buck, you
know, standing by a deepwater pool.

25:37.035 --> 25:43.207
So, uh, I made this very soft approach
and I lined him up dead center: Pow!

25:43.750 --> 25:45.918
You should have had your camera.

25:46.127 --> 25:47.253
Are you having it mounted?

25:47.504 --> 25:53.008
Oh, yeah, yeah, even as we speak.
It was great, just great. Um...

25:53.510 --> 25:56.136
I think I better go
and check on your mama.

25:56.346 --> 25:59.223
She's not here, Ernie.
She's gone back to Seattle.

25:59.849 --> 26:00.891
Seattle?

26:02.310 --> 26:04.937
And that's where I think
you should go too.

26:19.244 --> 26:22.705
Hey, buddy,
what's with the long face?

26:22.872 --> 26:26.166
- Vivian's gone back to Seattle.
- Better for you, buckeroo.

26:26.376 --> 26:30.379
We got four kilos to unload. You want
the ball-and-chain getting in the way?

26:30.547 --> 26:32.881
Yeah, I suppose you are right.

26:33.300 --> 26:35.342
There's the phone, hotrod.

26:35.552 --> 26:37.595
We're on a deadline.

26:44.102 --> 26:47.104
Here we go. Two three-berry pies

26:47.314 --> 26:50.232
and one super snow frost
chocolate malted.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.109
Wow, thanks.

26:53.361 --> 26:56.655
Looks just like Whitetail Mountain,
doesn't it, Nicky?

26:56.865 --> 26:57.906
How much does it cost?

26:58.116 --> 27:01.952
Oh, money is no object,
little Nicholas. Ha-ha-ha.

27:02.162 --> 27:04.622
Aah! Damn. Damn.

27:05.373 --> 27:06.582
Damn.

27:06.791 --> 27:08.000
Sorry, Uncle Dick.

27:08.209 --> 27:09.418
It's okay, Nicky.

27:09.628 --> 27:12.129
Uncle Dick isn't mad.
Are you, Uncle Dick?

27:12.297 --> 27:17.009
Uncle Dick is simply ripping, thank
you. Pass me a napkin, Uncle Andy.

27:24.184 --> 27:26.852
- Oh.
- Ha-ha-ha.

27:27.771 --> 27:29.730
Gosh darn it, anyway.

27:29.939 --> 27:31.398
Sorry, Uncle Andy.

27:31.900 --> 27:33.776
Think nothing of it, little Nicky.

27:34.402 --> 27:37.196
Uncle Andy went funny boom-boom,
didn't he?

27:43.953 --> 27:46.497
I think I can put this right.

27:47.874 --> 27:50.042
It is beautiful.

27:50.293 --> 27:52.795
Jeffrey loves this car.

27:53.171 --> 27:55.005
My husband.

27:55.215 --> 27:57.174
He loves this car.

27:58.051 --> 28:00.636
Where is your husband, Mrs. Marsh?

28:00.804 --> 28:02.513
I don't know this week.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.640
He travels extensively.

28:04.891 --> 28:06.600
Business.

28:07.352 --> 28:10.437
This car was built in 1948.

28:10.772 --> 28:14.900
Jeffrey has to have the most unique
and beautiful toys.

28:15.110 --> 28:17.236
They have to be perfect.

28:17.612 --> 28:20.322
He's that way
about everything he owns.

28:20.990 --> 28:24.576
I could have learned something from
that if I'd been paying attention.

28:24.994 --> 28:26.870
Are you that way, James?

28:27.080 --> 28:29.164
Are you that way about your bike?

28:29.374 --> 28:31.583
I guess I'm not so interested
in how my bike looks

28:31.751 --> 28:33.460
as I am in where it can take me.

28:33.670 --> 28:35.629
Where do you wanna go?

28:36.256 --> 28:39.341
It's not really a place, it's a feeling.

28:41.469 --> 28:44.221
Sometimes, riding at night...

28:45.640 --> 28:50.269
...I punch off the headlights
and roll on the throttle...

28:50.729 --> 28:53.605
...and just rocket blind into the dark.

28:58.486 --> 29:00.154
So...

29:01.448 --> 29:03.615
...do you think you could fix it?

29:03.992 --> 29:05.576
Yeah.

29:07.245 --> 29:08.912
There's a room above the garage.

29:09.164 --> 29:11.540
You can stay there if you like
while you work.

29:11.750 --> 29:16.003
Room and board and anything else
you think is fair.

29:16.546 --> 29:20.174
I really do need to have this fixed
before Jeffrey gets home.

29:21.009 --> 29:22.968
I'd like you to stay, James.

29:23.178 --> 29:25.387
I'd enjoy the company.

29:26.806 --> 29:28.015
Okay.

29:28.224 --> 29:29.516
Good.

29:29.726 --> 29:32.936
It's settled then. I'll leave you to it.

30:43.758 --> 30:48.387
Now is the winter of our discontent

30:48.638 --> 30:54.852
Made glorious summer
by this sun of York;

31:19.085 --> 31:25.007
Now are our brows bound
with victorious wreaths;

31:30.638 --> 31:32.681
A stag party?

31:32.891 --> 31:34.558
And I wasn't even invited?

31:35.435 --> 31:38.979
Where the hell have you been?

31:39.439 --> 31:44.818
Ben, I have had an absolutely
killer schedule.

32:00.752 --> 32:04.087
Do you know the kind of hell
that I have been through

32:04.255 --> 32:06.423
in the last few days?

32:06.841 --> 32:12.262
You said that you took care
of Catherine in the mill fire.

32:12.472 --> 32:14.056
She's alive.

32:14.265 --> 32:17.851
And as you might imagine,
not a happy camper.

32:18.978 --> 32:20.646
Through trickery...

32:20.855 --> 32:22.606
...extortion...

32:22.815 --> 32:28.028
She has managed
to cheat me out of both.

32:28.237 --> 32:31.031
Both Ghostwood and the mill.

32:32.033 --> 32:34.493
Then there is the, uh...

32:34.661 --> 32:38.413
...small matter of being arrested
for the killing of...

32:38.665 --> 32:39.706
...Laura Palmer.

32:41.668 --> 32:43.543
A real business-enhancer.

32:46.047 --> 32:50.467
On top of which, my trusted solicitor,
the late Leland Palmer...

32:50.677 --> 32:54.262
...turns out to be
a homicidal lunatic.

32:54.597 --> 32:55.973
Tough week, Ben.

32:58.601 --> 33:02.354
Do you think the furniture
in this room is adequately arranged?

33:03.523 --> 33:05.857
I have been toying with the notion

33:06.067 --> 33:09.111
that if one could find

33:09.320 --> 33:13.865
the perfect arrangement
of all objects in any particular space,

33:14.117 --> 33:18.161
it could create a resonance
the benefits from which

33:18.371 --> 33:22.666
to the individual dwelling in that
space could be, uh...

33:23.167 --> 33:26.837
...could be extensive,
could be far-reaching, far-reaching.

33:28.131 --> 33:30.090
Would you help me with this desk?

33:30.299 --> 33:32.718
That's fascinating, Ben, really.

33:32.927 --> 33:36.471
Listen, though, what we have to talk
about now...

33:36.681 --> 33:37.723
...is One-Eyed Jack's.

33:37.932 --> 33:39.891
Jack's, Jack's. Yes, One-Eyed Jack's.

33:40.101 --> 33:41.476
Look, here's how it is, Ben.

33:41.978 --> 33:43.729
Ben.

33:44.939 --> 33:45.981
You're out.

33:47.066 --> 33:48.817
Excuse me?

33:50.236 --> 33:52.571
I own One-Eyed Jack's.

33:54.949 --> 33:56.742
There's been a friendly takeover.

33:58.578 --> 34:05.250
You come in here under my employ
and have the gall to tell me...

34:05.418 --> 34:07.335
Oh, that's another thing.

34:07.545 --> 34:09.880
I don't work for you anymore.

34:15.303 --> 34:17.137
Renault.

34:17.472 --> 34:19.056
Jean Renault.

34:23.478 --> 34:26.063
It's Renault, isn't it? Hank.

34:26.272 --> 34:28.106
Let me tell you something.

34:28.316 --> 34:31.109
The guy is a psychopath.

34:31.319 --> 34:34.488
Psychopath.

34:34.697 --> 34:39.242
And you, my friend,
are dancing with the devil.

34:39.452 --> 34:41.787
Ben, you're a nut.

34:41.996 --> 34:43.705
You think I'm just gonna sit here?

34:43.915 --> 34:46.416
Mm? Let you take all this.

34:47.335 --> 34:48.710
Ben.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.796
Life is change.

34:51.005 --> 34:55.675
I want you to listen to me when I
tell you that this is how it's gonna be.

34:56.844 --> 35:00.263
Don't patronize me, you goon.

35:02.183 --> 35:04.768
You're a mess, Ben. Look at you.

35:04.977 --> 35:07.646
You screwed up, boss man.

35:08.606 --> 35:10.690
You're out, Ben.

35:26.457 --> 35:28.250
"You're out, Ben.

35:31.963 --> 35:35.757
You're out, Ben. Ha-ha-ha!

35:37.009 --> 35:38.760
Mm!

35:39.011 --> 35:42.514
You're out. Ben, you're out.

35:49.522 --> 35:51.606
Ben, you're out."

36:02.535 --> 36:04.661
Windom Earle.

36:29.812 --> 36:32.439
Of course,
you couldn't help but take note of

36:32.607 --> 36:35.525
my emphatically traditional
opening.

36:35.735 --> 36:38.778
I must say,
your responding move was nothing

36:38.946 --> 36:43.909
if not reflective of your predilection
for the tidy and fastidious.

36:44.118 --> 36:47.078
See how my response to you
begins to lead us

36:47.246 --> 36:50.248
towards a classical
confrontation?

36:50.458 --> 36:52.876
But there's doubt in your mind.

36:53.044 --> 36:56.171
What are my true intentions?

36:56.380 --> 36:59.424
How will you answer this time?

36:59.634 --> 37:01.843
Hobgoblins, Dale.

37:02.011 --> 37:07.098
Consistency, predictability,
giving rise to patterns.

37:07.308 --> 37:08.975
We both know only too well

37:09.143 --> 37:13.146
how these patterns leave you
vulnerable to attack.

37:13.356 --> 37:14.898
You with your wounds.

37:15.107 --> 37:16.650
I with mine.

37:16.859 --> 37:19.152
Let me paint you a picture.

37:19.362 --> 37:21.112
My knights will skirmish.

37:21.322 --> 37:25.951
Lanes of power and influence will
open to my bishops and rooks.

37:26.160 --> 37:28.536
Pawns will naturally be forfeit.

37:28.704 --> 37:32.666
I'm even prepared to sacrifice
my queen because I assure you,

37:32.833 --> 37:37.420
dear Dale, my goal will be attained
at any cost.

37:37.630 --> 37:41.549
The king must die.

37:47.139 --> 37:51.184
Do you, Douglas Milford,
take this woman to be your wife...

37:51.477 --> 37:55.230
...to love and to cherish,
for as long as you both shall live?

38:02.113 --> 38:03.738
You bet, I do, Reverend.

38:03.948 --> 38:07.909
If there be anyone who knows not
why this union should be made,

38:08.411 --> 38:11.079
let him speak now
or forever hold his peace.

38:11.330 --> 38:13.456
You're damn right. I want to object.

38:14.041 --> 38:17.794
This little gold digger
just wants his money,

38:18.129 --> 38:20.130
and his publishing empire,

38:20.339 --> 38:21.965
and God knows what all.

38:22.216 --> 38:23.591
And look at him,

38:23.801 --> 38:26.761
he's got one foot
in the grave already. Ha-ha-ha.

38:27.513 --> 38:30.265
Okay, Dwayne,
okay, just take her easy.

38:30.474 --> 38:31.850
- Take her easy.
- All right.

38:32.018 --> 38:34.853
You know that I have had problems,
sheriff. All these years.

38:35.021 --> 38:37.230
Okay, Mr. Mayor,
let's just get a little air. Shall we?

38:37.398 --> 38:38.940
It's pretty peculiar, isn't it?

38:39.108 --> 38:40.942
Don't give it another thought, doll.

38:41.152 --> 38:44.446
- Well, I know this is my opinion,
- Let's get out, let's just get out.

38:44.613 --> 38:47.073
- and I want you to all understand it.
- Excuse us.

38:47.283 --> 38:50.035
Marrying every two months...
Good God.

38:51.287 --> 38:54.414
So if there be no further objections...

39:03.299 --> 39:04.966
Cooper here.

39:05.176 --> 39:06.843
Denise.

39:07.595 --> 39:09.929
Well, that'll be nice.
I'll be right down.

39:17.855 --> 39:19.689
Diane, when I've got a moment,

39:19.899 --> 39:23.026
remind me to tell you
about Agent Bryson.

39:46.300 --> 39:50.095
I just love Milford weddings.

39:50.721 --> 39:52.138
Unfair advantage.

39:52.348 --> 39:54.557
How many of those girls
were varsity wide receivers?

39:55.476 --> 39:56.518
Very few.

39:58.562 --> 40:00.063
Bad news first.

40:00.272 --> 40:02.273
I found cocaine residue in your car.

40:02.691 --> 40:05.693
And my guess is it will match the lot
stolen from the Mountie.

40:05.861 --> 40:08.571
- Dennis, this can't appear straight.
- Denise.

40:09.698 --> 40:11.866
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

40:12.118 --> 40:13.827
Sure it looks like a frame, Coop.

40:14.036 --> 40:16.621
But I'm gonna need more than
your opinion to make that stick.

40:17.790 --> 40:18.998
Can you help me?

40:19.208 --> 40:21.126
Well, that gets
into a very delicate area.

40:22.878 --> 40:25.088
But on the other hand,
I'm trying very hard, recently,

40:25.256 --> 40:27.465
to get more in touch
with my feelings.

40:31.637 --> 40:34.222
Ladies and gentlemen, the cake.

40:34.598 --> 40:37.642
Dougie's always been a sucker.

40:37.977 --> 40:39.894
Let a woman pass...

40:40.104 --> 40:42.021
...with play in her eyes...

40:42.231 --> 40:46.276
...and Jell-O in her walk,
and he's a trout on a hook. Ha-ha-ha.

40:55.286 --> 40:56.369
So, Denise,

40:57.746 --> 41:00.206
if you don't mind my asking,

41:00.708 --> 41:03.001
- what happened to you?
- No, not at all.

41:03.210 --> 41:04.752
I like to talk about it.

41:04.962 --> 41:06.379
It's really very simple.

41:06.630 --> 41:09.799
Last year, I was working undercover
suburban surveillance

41:10.301 --> 41:12.302
and the seller had a few kinks
in his rep.

41:12.511 --> 41:15.430
It seems that he'd only sell
to transvestites.

41:15.639 --> 41:18.057
So my partner and I shacked up.

41:18.267 --> 41:20.602
I played the part of the buyer.

41:20.811 --> 41:25.648
And I found that wearing women's
clothes...

41:26.442 --> 41:28.359
...relaxed me.

41:29.069 --> 41:31.029
I continued wearing them
into the night.

41:31.655 --> 41:35.366
My partner thought it was
my consummate professionalism. Heh.

41:35.826 --> 41:37.952
It was a very confusing two weeks.

41:38.370 --> 41:41.414
Well, this is all
a pretty amazing disclosure,

41:41.624 --> 41:42.665
Denise.

41:43.584 --> 41:46.252
Imagine how surprised I was, Coop.

41:46.462 --> 41:48.630
This is not exactly
something you plan on.

41:48.839 --> 41:50.048
Guess not.

41:51.467 --> 41:53.885
- Sheriff.
- Harry.

41:54.261 --> 41:55.512
I'll have a draft.

41:56.096 --> 41:58.473
Sheriff, arrest this woman.

41:58.682 --> 42:01.142
She's too beautiful to be living
in this state.

42:02.770 --> 42:04.646
Oh, hey, aren't you that FBI man?

42:04.855 --> 42:06.981
Not currently, no.

42:07.191 --> 42:08.316
Dale Cooper.

42:08.526 --> 42:10.026
Dale.

42:10.194 --> 42:12.403
You solved
that Laura Palmer case, huh?

42:12.613 --> 42:16.741
Come on, darling,
they're playing our tune. See you.

42:21.205 --> 42:24.249
I sure hope those two go up
to the honeymoon suite soon.

42:24.458 --> 42:27.210
We've had to separate Dwayne
and Dougie twice already.

42:27.419 --> 42:29.045
Happens every wedding.

42:29.255 --> 42:30.672
Boys will be boys.

42:30.881 --> 42:35.301
I was married to the same woman
for half a century.

42:36.345 --> 42:38.680
God rest her soul.

42:39.014 --> 42:43.309
That's because I used my brain
for thinking, not my garden hose.

42:43.519 --> 42:47.021
This cake is delicious.

42:51.610 --> 42:53.653
The music...

42:54.154 --> 42:55.780
...turned out pretty good.

42:58.617 --> 43:01.160
It ought have been the death march.
Ha, ha.

43:07.084 --> 43:09.127
You're an excellent dancer.

43:09.336 --> 43:10.962
The wonderful thing about dancing,
Audrey,

43:11.130 --> 43:13.047
is that you never know
where the step could lead.

43:13.215 --> 43:16.134
You have to hang on
and hope the music takes you there.

43:27.605 --> 43:31.357
Your brother,
my husband, Andrew Packard,

43:31.859 --> 43:35.486
was killed by a man
named Thomas Eckhardt.

43:36.030 --> 43:38.906
Tell me something
I don't already know.

43:40.242 --> 43:43.036
You're in terrible danger, Catherine.

43:44.913 --> 43:47.915
You helped kill my brother,

43:48.542 --> 43:54.297
tried to cheat me out of my land,
my family's lifeblood,

43:54.506 --> 43:58.968
utterly destroy my existence,
and now you want to save me?

43:59.803 --> 44:03.431
I had to do these things to stay alive.

44:05.225 --> 44:07.810
I have no one to turn to now.

44:09.938 --> 44:11.105
I've got nothing.

44:11.899 --> 44:14.609
And I'm at your mercy.

44:16.820 --> 44:18.029
Oh.

44:18.197 --> 44:19.947
Now...

44:20.157 --> 44:21.491
...enough.

44:22.493 --> 44:25.119
Let's be practical.

44:25.871 --> 44:27.955
What do you propose we do?

44:29.625 --> 44:30.875
I don't know.

44:31.085 --> 44:32.794
Then I'll tell you.

44:33.420 --> 44:35.463
From now on...

44:37.257 --> 44:39.425
...you work for me.

44:40.177 --> 44:41.803
Here.

44:42.221 --> 44:43.513
At the house.

44:43.764 --> 44:44.972
As a maid.

44:45.140 --> 44:48.309
You move your things
into the servant's quarters.

44:48.560 --> 44:50.645
If you disobey me,

44:51.980 --> 44:54.190
if you lie to me,

44:55.067 --> 44:59.487
if you contradict
a single thing I tell you,

45:00.823 --> 45:03.783
I shall find this Eckhardt

45:04.243 --> 45:07.620
and feed you to him by hand.

45:07.955 --> 45:10.206
Is that clear?

45:11.375 --> 45:13.126
Speak!

45:14.336 --> 45:16.379
Yes, I understand.

45:16.964 --> 45:18.423
Fine.

45:18.924 --> 45:22.051
We'll talk about this Eckhardt
some other time.

45:22.594 --> 45:24.470
You may go to your room.

45:26.223 --> 45:27.557
Thank you.

45:28.976 --> 45:30.560
Josie...

45:31.854 --> 45:35.189
I'll take breakfast at 7 in my room.

45:35.899 --> 45:39.902
Coffee, juice,
dry toast, oatmeal.

45:40.988 --> 45:43.990
- Yes.
- Sweet dreams.

45:53.459 --> 45:54.667
Happy, Andrew?

45:57.755 --> 46:01.549
Everything is going exactly
as we planned.

46:01.967 --> 46:03.176
And now?

46:03.761 --> 46:06.262
And now, dear sister,
we wait for Thomas Eckhardt

46:06.430 --> 46:11.809
to come looking
for his one true love.

46:13.061 --> 46:15.229
And when he does...

46:16.732 --> 47:23.965
We'll be waiting for him.
