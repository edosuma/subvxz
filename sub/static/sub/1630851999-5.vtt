[female journalist] <i>We're just a few days</i>
<i>out from the opening of</i> Freaky Friday<i>.</i>

00:05.338 --> 00:07.674
It's a dream come true.
Isn't that right, Caterina?

00:07.757 --> 00:09.050
PREVIOUSLY

00:09.134 --> 00:10.760
Honestly, I have no words.

00:10.844 --> 00:14.055
I applied to a literary workshop
with Oliverio Gerard.

00:14.139 --> 00:15.557
And the Eleven O'Clock tour?

00:16.433 --> 00:18.393
They'll have to go without me.

00:18.476 --> 00:20.854
Your mom seems pretty happy
with the life she has.

00:20.937 --> 00:22.063
No, you're wrong.

00:22.147 --> 00:24.357
[Marco] <i>It's only a role on opening day.</i>

00:24.441 --> 00:26.693
I don't understand
what we're doing together.

00:26.776 --> 00:28.028
We're done.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.904
<i>We're playing at CD Room on Thursday.</i>

00:29.988 --> 00:32.699
You can save me a slow dance
after the show.

00:32.782 --> 00:34.576
-[Allegra] <i>And Greta?</i>
-I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

00:34.659 --> 00:37.662
It would make me really sad
if you got your hopes up.

00:38.496 --> 00:40.165
[Allegra] <i>Marco Resco.</i>

00:41.374 --> 00:43.376
There's nothing about him on the Internet.

00:43.460 --> 00:44.461
<i>Isn't that strange?</i>

01:01.936 --> 01:02.937
Are you all right?

01:03.021 --> 01:05.315
-I have to go.
-What? Where?

01:05.940 --> 01:06.941
To the bathroom.

01:14.866 --> 01:16.868
[thunder rumbling]

01:27.712 --> 01:30.173
INTERTWINED

01:34.219 --> 01:38.014
[Dante] Yes. It was good, hey?
It was good. I liked it. I liked it.

01:38.807 --> 01:39.849
Hey, Marco.

01:40.975 --> 01:43.395
I still can't believe
what you did on stage.

01:43.478 --> 01:46.106
That sampling was killer, eh?

01:47.816 --> 01:49.442
You guys want something to drink?

01:50.568 --> 01:51.611
Should I get something?

01:56.741 --> 01:59.577
"Sampling" is stealing.

01:59.661 --> 02:02.122
"Sampling" is progress.

02:02.205 --> 02:03.790
Welcome to the '90s.

02:03.873 --> 02:05.291
Don't give me that, Marco.

02:05.375 --> 02:08.670
Recording a person speaking and putting it
in a song doesn't make it music.

02:08.753 --> 02:11.798
I'm experimenting, Diego.
The possibilities are endless.

02:11.881 --> 02:14.551
Fine. Fine. But today of all days,
with the producer here,

02:14.634 --> 02:17.345
-you decided to become an innovator?
-Maybe he liked it.

02:17.429 --> 02:18.596
[chuckling]

02:19.514 --> 02:22.851
The only person who likes
your crazy ideas is Laura.

02:24.352 --> 02:25.937
We'll continue this later.

02:28.815 --> 02:29.816
[sighs]

02:31.776 --> 02:33.111
WOMEN'S HAIRCUTS

02:33.194 --> 02:34.946
[Greta] Am I wrong to think that?

02:35.030 --> 02:38.783
I mean, from one day to the next,
you feel differently. You stop feeling it.

02:38.867 --> 02:41.494
I swear I don't understand.
What did Marco see in her?

02:41.578 --> 02:43.329
What do you mean what did he see in her,
sweetie?

02:43.413 --> 02:47.334
She's pretty, talented, she has a--

02:47.834 --> 02:50.795
No, I don't understand
what he saw in her either. No idea.

02:52.589 --> 02:55.258
What happened? Did you lose your new girl?

02:57.010 --> 02:58.595
Did you see her in the bathroom?

02:59.554 --> 03:02.724
I don't believe it. She went
to the bathroom and didn't come back?

03:03.433 --> 03:05.810
Looks like you've been ditched.

03:06.311 --> 03:07.312
Ouch.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.439
[both laugh]

03:09.522 --> 03:10.565
[wry chuckle]

03:13.568 --> 03:15.904
I don't know what to do
for the open audition.

03:15.987 --> 03:18.740
I'm looking for references,
and nothing inspires me.

03:19.491 --> 03:21.326
You know what would inspire me?

03:22.160 --> 03:23.203
A pizza.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.331
Relax. You have lots of time.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.958
And you got Allegra out of your way.
You have no competition.

03:30.168 --> 03:33.588
Hmm-mm.
The hardest competition is with yourself.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.966
[cell phone chimes]

03:39.719 --> 03:42.639
"I know what you did,
and you're going to pay for it."

03:42.722 --> 03:43.973
Yeah, I got the same thing.

03:45.475 --> 03:46.768
This has Félix written all over it.

03:47.769 --> 03:48.978
I'm sure you let it slip.

03:49.479 --> 03:52.232
Did you delete the message
off Félix's phone after sending it?

03:52.315 --> 03:54.192
Obviously.
What, do you think I'm an idiot?

03:54.275 --> 03:56.903
-[door opens]
-Cut.

03:58.905 --> 04:02.158
Great performance, guys. Really.

04:05.954 --> 04:06.955
[doorbell rings]

04:07.038 --> 04:09.791
-[footsteps approach]
-[doorbell rings rapidly]

04:11.960 --> 04:14.004
We have to talk. Let me in. Let me in.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.380
We have nothing to talk about.

04:15.463 --> 04:17.882
-I have something important to show you.
-I'm not interested.

04:17.966 --> 04:19.634
[sighs] Look.

04:19.718 --> 04:21.970
[Sofía] <i>"I know what you did,</i>
<i>and you're going to pay for it."</i>

04:22.053 --> 04:24.764
[Alan] <i>Yeah, I got the same thing.</i>
<i>This has Félix written all over it.</i>

04:24.848 --> 04:27.392
[Sofía] <i>I'm sure you let it slip.</i>
<i>Did you delete the message…</i>

04:27.475 --> 04:28.476
Now do you believe me?

04:29.853 --> 04:31.938
I told you I had nothing to do with it.

04:32.022 --> 04:33.273
It was Sofía and Alan.

04:33.356 --> 04:35.275
[scoffs] But why?

04:35.358 --> 04:38.737
What? Why? It's obvious.
Sofía wants you out of her way.

04:38.820 --> 04:41.990
She doesn't want any competition
at the auditions.

04:43.700 --> 04:47.078
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I didn't trust you.

04:47.162 --> 04:48.163
Me neither.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.041
What can I do so that you forgive me?

04:51.791 --> 04:55.295
Mmm, maybe you could buy me a drink?

04:56.755 --> 04:57.756
Good idea.

04:57.839 --> 04:59.049
You and me.

05:00.717 --> 05:03.011
And I felt a strong connection with Marco.

05:03.803 --> 05:06.222
It's a shame
that in the middle of our kiss--

05:06.306 --> 05:08.725
-Félix, are you all right?
-I'm all right.

05:08.808 --> 05:11.644
With Caterina, Caterina.
How'd it go with her? Tell me.

05:11.728 --> 05:15.398
[sighs] I don't know how to explain. I've
never felt so comfortable with someone.

05:15.482 --> 05:17.067
Well, you don't have to exaggerate.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.903
You sound like you've never had
a friend in your life.

05:19.986 --> 05:22.197
I've never gotten along so well
with a girl.

05:22.781 --> 05:25.158
I feel like my mom
is my first female friend.

05:30.205 --> 05:32.540
I definitely will never get used to that.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.085
[sighs]

05:35.168 --> 05:38.713
And how'd it go with Caterina and Cocó?
Did you find out more?

05:38.797 --> 05:41.174
Yes. Greta's not the problem.

05:41.257 --> 05:44.636
My mom wants to write, and that's why
she has to leave Eleven O' Clock.

05:44.719 --> 05:46.554
I have to stop her.

05:46.638 --> 05:47.764
No. No, wait.

05:47.847 --> 05:49.891
It's one thing to stop Greta
from hurting her,

05:49.974 --> 05:52.394
but destroying her dream?

05:52.477 --> 05:55.105
I'm not destroying anyone's dream.

05:55.188 --> 05:58.733
My mom has no idea what she'll lose
when she leaves the company, but I do.

05:59.442 --> 06:02.570
What did she achieve in her life?
Nothing. She sells books.

06:02.654 --> 06:04.906
[scoffs] And what's wrong with that?

06:04.989 --> 06:07.450
The bookstore is heaven to Caterina.

06:07.951 --> 06:09.994
-I think you need to start--
-If I help her in the past,

06:10.078 --> 06:12.580
I'm sure she'll achieve something
more important

06:12.664 --> 06:14.624
than spending all day behind a counter.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.292
[sighs]

06:16.376 --> 06:18.712
She'll become Cocó Sharp's successor.

FOUNDATIONS

06:24.843 --> 06:26.636
[humming]

06:26.720 --> 06:29.472
Pass me the Virginia Woolf.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.309
No, no. <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>.

06:34.144 --> 06:36.521
It's next to
<i>In Search of Lost Time</i> by Proust.

06:38.314 --> 06:42.152
Wouldn't it be better if they were
in alphabetical order? This is chaos.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.571
Well, there's order in my chaos.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.323
The order is ready.

06:47.407 --> 06:50.035
Where did you get the idea
to open a bookstore?

06:51.327 --> 06:52.412
Why do you ask?

06:53.246 --> 06:54.914
I don't know. You never told me.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.668
It was thanks to my grandma.

06:58.752 --> 06:59.919
Lucía?

07:00.003 --> 07:01.087
Yes.

07:01.713 --> 07:03.298
She loved reading.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.925
Opening her books was like
getting a peek inside her head.

07:06.009 --> 07:09.012
They were all underlined, with notes.

07:10.805 --> 07:13.975
When she died, I inherited her collection.

07:15.477 --> 07:19.397
I think that was when I realized I wanted
to offer others what she had given me:

07:19.939 --> 07:21.524
the love of books.

07:22.025 --> 07:23.943
These are all Lucía's books?

07:24.027 --> 07:26.654
No, hers are in the living room library.

07:27.822 --> 07:30.116
I'd never sell the only thing
I have of my grandmother's.

07:33.578 --> 07:34.704
Don't listen to me.

07:34.788 --> 07:37.499
[chuckles] Lately, that's what I do best.

07:38.500 --> 07:39.709
-That's true.
-[chuckles]

07:40.710 --> 07:42.128
[door opens]

07:46.633 --> 07:48.134
I'm sorry to interrupt you,

07:48.927 --> 07:51.471
but we have to go
to physical therapy today, Caterina.

07:52.389 --> 07:53.640
The car is outside.

07:53.723 --> 07:56.768
It's not that I am not grateful
for your sudden interest in me--

07:56.851 --> 07:59.104
which, by the way, is 20 years late--

08:00.772 --> 08:02.357
but I can go on my own.

08:03.149 --> 08:06.236
No problem.
I'll stay and keep Allegra company.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.697
We can go over some <i>Freaky Friday</i> scenes.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.615
-Yeah--
-No, no. No.

08:11.366 --> 08:12.617
So…

08:13.702 --> 08:15.787
I think I need your help.

08:16.996 --> 08:18.707
I'll wait for you in the car.

08:21.459 --> 08:22.752
[sighs]

08:22.836 --> 08:26.423
Allegra, I need to ask you a favor.
Someone's coming to pick up those books.

08:26.506 --> 08:29.384
Give them the order and take their payment
in cash. It's very important.

08:29.968 --> 08:32.429
-I will give them the order, then go--
-Nowhere.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.848
Stay here until I come back, mmm?

08:34.931 --> 08:38.601
Take advantage of this opportunity
to learn the family business.

08:41.146 --> 08:42.897
[car horn honks]

08:42.981 --> 08:45.734
-Musical theater is the family business.

09:03.668 --> 09:06.004
-Hello, yes?
-Hello. How are you? Is Laura home?

09:06.087 --> 09:08.882
-Laura?
-Yes, Laura. Your-- Your daughter.

09:09.549 --> 09:13.178
No. I think you've got the wrong address,
because I don't have daughters.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.055
-Sorry.
-Well.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.265
-I must be confused. Bye.
-Yes. Goodbye.

[door shuts]

09:21.102 --> 09:22.145
[sighs]

09:24.939 --> 09:27.025
Do we really need to move this? [grunts]

09:27.108 --> 09:30.362
My mom wants me to work here all summer.
I need space to rehearse.

09:30.445 --> 09:32.572
-What about the short?
-Believe me, Félix,

09:32.655 --> 09:36.493
I'd much rather be in front of a camera
than behind a counter, okay?

09:37.118 --> 09:38.828
We knew you would be here.

09:39.621 --> 09:42.916
Dad forgot this at home.
Mom says you should take it to his office.

09:44.459 --> 09:46.461
Good thing you two came.

09:46.544 --> 09:48.046
I have something for you.

09:51.841 --> 09:54.386
Don't worry. It's a gift. No charge.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.514
"Learning to Manage your Emotions."

09:58.181 --> 10:00.725
There's a whole chapter on envy.

10:00.809 --> 10:02.268
It'll be great for you two,

10:02.352 --> 10:05.438
because sending the video to my mom
was a terrible idea.

10:05.522 --> 10:06.523
Terrible.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.776
Ah, we just wanted to help you
avoid the frustration

10:09.859 --> 10:12.904
of having to audition again
and not making it into the company.

10:14.155 --> 10:19.035
Do you have anything
by Peter Brook or Meisner?

10:19.119 --> 10:22.539
They'd be good for you to read
before the last Eleven O'Clock audition.

10:22.622 --> 10:23.623
You've got time.

10:23.707 --> 10:26.876
[chuckles] Thanks for the recommendation.
I'll give you another.

10:26.960 --> 10:30.005
Don't get between Félix and me again.
You'll regret it.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.757
Ah. [laughs]

10:33.299 --> 10:34.300
Let's go.

Great performance.

10:40.432 --> 10:41.433

11:05.081 --> 11:06.624
No. Nobody came.

11:06.708 --> 11:08.668
<i>Weird. Well, we'll talk later.</i>

"Light Years"
A novel by Caterina Sharp

11:26.686 --> 11:29.314
[Caterina reading]
<i>If I could take something with me</i>

11:29.397 --> 11:30.398
<i>on my time travels,</i>

11:30.482 --> 11:32.108
<i>I would choose my flowers.</i>

11:32.817 --> 11:35.445
<i>I have always liked white flowers.</i>

11:35.528 --> 11:38.615
<i>Jasmine, calla lilies, daisies.</i>

11:38.698 --> 11:40.909
<i>But gardenias are my favorite.</i>

11:42.035 --> 11:44.579
<i>Sometimes I take flowers from our garden.</i>

11:45.246 --> 11:49.626
I like to calmly and patiently
caress their delicateness,

feel them in my hands,

11:51.628 --> 11:53.213
see them in my home,

11:53.296 --> 11:54.631
have them close.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.927
[sighs] I like these descriptive passages,

11:59.010 --> 12:01.096
but I'm afraid they're boring.

12:01.179 --> 12:04.516
What do you think about me shortening
this part a little?

12:04.599 --> 12:05.767
No.

12:05.850 --> 12:08.561
This is not the time to--
to edit the text.

12:08.645 --> 12:10.271
You have to let it go,

12:10.355 --> 12:14.943
step away and then read it again
later with fresh eyes.

12:15.652 --> 12:17.570
I just want to send the best version.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.282
Anything you can't solve now,

12:21.366 --> 12:24.411
you'll be able to solve
with the help of Oliverio Gerard.

12:24.911 --> 12:27.288
That's why you signed up for his workshop.

12:27.372 --> 12:29.249
I'm just so nervous.

12:30.125 --> 12:32.627
I can't believe I made the short list.

12:32.711 --> 12:36.840
-I was sure you would.
-And I couldn't have done it without you.

12:36.923 --> 12:38.258
-Mm.
-Thank you.

12:40.802 --> 12:42.178
Your friend Laura.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.348
You never told me how you two met.

12:45.432 --> 12:48.560
At the theater.
She appeared out of nowhere one day.

12:49.144 --> 12:51.229
It was magical.

12:51.980 --> 12:54.232
-We had a special connection.
-Mm.

12:56.526 --> 12:58.278
Why do you ask?

12:58.361 --> 12:59.571
Just curious.

13:01.072 --> 13:03.116
I'm going to make tea.
Would you like some?

13:06.828 --> 13:10.248
[reading] <i>The scent of gardenias</i>
<i>throughout the house</i>

13:10.331 --> 13:12.584
<i>is also yours and mine.</i>

13:16.254 --> 13:18.423
<i>I walk and breathe calmly.</i>

13:19.174 --> 13:21.468
<i>Past and present become one in me,</i>

13:22.135 --> 13:23.595
<i>and I feel you at my side.</i>

13:38.735 --> 13:40.153
[exhales]

13:40.236 --> 13:43.281
[breathing heavily]

13:45.116 --> 13:46.451
[door opens]

13:46.534 --> 13:47.994
Are you all right?

13:48.078 --> 13:50.372
Lucía, yes. Yes, yes, I'm fine.

13:50.455 --> 13:54.501
I was looking for a-- a hat.

13:54.584 --> 13:56.461
Yes, a hat. We need it for--

13:56.544 --> 13:59.381
Ever since I saw you,
your face has looked familiar to me.

14:00.715 --> 14:03.051
But it took seeing the bracelet
to understand.

14:05.095 --> 14:06.221
You're a Sharp.

14:09.766 --> 14:12.894
I need you to promise me
that this will stay between us.

14:14.270 --> 14:15.271
[sighs]

14:16.940 --> 14:18.108
My name is Allegra.

14:18.942 --> 14:20.777
I'm Caterina's daughter.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.946
[chuckles]

14:23.029 --> 14:25.281
Caterina's daughter? Ah.

14:25.949 --> 14:27.242
But how did you know that…

14:28.326 --> 14:30.161
All this appearing from nowhere,

14:30.245 --> 14:32.997
falling on the flowers,
your jasmine allergy.

14:34.290 --> 14:37.293
-How did you find the bracelet?
-Here at the house.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.671
Well, not in this house.

14:39.754 --> 14:41.423
In this house in the future.

14:42.007 --> 14:43.383
My mom and I live here.

14:44.134 --> 14:46.261
You found it hidden in the wall?

14:46.344 --> 14:48.346
Yes, I accidently broke the wall…

14:49.347 --> 14:51.850
Wait. How do you know where it was?

14:52.851 --> 14:54.269
Because I hid it there.

14:56.646 --> 14:58.523
So you know how it works?

14:58.606 --> 15:00.942
Why does it always bring me
to this place and time?

15:01.484 --> 15:04.029
There must be something
for you to resolve here and now.

15:04.112 --> 15:06.156
But only you can discover that.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.866
How much longer will I continue traveling?

15:10.326 --> 15:12.912
A bit longer. See these knots?

15:12.996 --> 15:14.914
Yes. Some of them have been coming untied.

15:14.998 --> 15:18.710
When the last one is untied,
your travels are over.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.713
And if I haven't resolved
what I came to resolve?

15:21.796 --> 15:24.799
Don't worry. You will. Mmm?

15:25.592 --> 15:28.386
The most important thing to remember

15:28.470 --> 15:32.098
is that this isn't your place
or your time, Allegra.

15:33.141 --> 15:34.684
What are you trying to say?

15:34.768 --> 15:36.811
The bracelet can be very useful,

15:36.895 --> 15:39.105
but it can also cause a lot of pain.

15:40.523 --> 15:42.525
How do you know so much
about the bracelet?

15:42.609 --> 15:43.860
Because I used it too.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.279
[Caterina] Laura.

15:47.072 --> 15:49.949
I thought I heard you.
You arrived just in time for tea.

15:50.033 --> 15:51.034
Yes.

15:51.826 --> 15:52.869
[chuckles]

16:05.215 --> 16:07.467
Are you going to tell me
why you disappeared?

16:09.469 --> 16:10.970
You didn't like the kiss?

16:12.055 --> 16:15.183
Okay, I have a confession.

16:15.266 --> 16:19.729
The first time I went out with Diego
was a disaster.

16:22.607 --> 16:25.777
Dreadful. [chuckles]
Twenty minutes just like that.

16:27.320 --> 16:32.659
But with time
and a few practical theory classes,

16:32.742 --> 16:34.202
he made great progress.

16:37.163 --> 16:38.164
What?

16:38.248 --> 16:40.917
Getting you to talk is harder
than getting my mom to shut up.

16:41.668 --> 16:44.212
What's the problem with Marco?

16:44.796 --> 16:46.798
Are you afraid
of getting involved with him?

16:47.841 --> 16:49.009
Yes, that's it.

16:49.092 --> 16:50.927
Fear is the worst adviser.

16:51.011 --> 16:53.763
If you really like him,
you should go for it.

16:53.847 --> 16:55.348
Listen to me.

16:55.432 --> 16:58.059
Go find him and finish
what you started at CD Room.

16:59.519 --> 17:00.520
What are you printing?

17:01.896 --> 17:04.024
It's the first few chapters of my novel.

17:04.107 --> 17:06.109
I have to take them
to Oliverio Gerard today.

17:06.192 --> 17:08.236
I have an interview with him.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.321
My life could change forever today.

17:10.405 --> 17:13.742
Your life will change for the better
if you're the lead in <i>Freaky Friday</i>.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.035
Believe me.

17:15.118 --> 17:17.662
If you like to write so much,
keep doing it.

17:17.746 --> 17:20.540
But you don't need to quit the company.

17:20.623 --> 17:22.834
I already told you. The tour is
at the same time as the workshop,

17:22.917 --> 17:25.128
and I don't want
to miss out on this opportunity.

17:25.211 --> 17:28.923
The opportunity you don't want to miss
is being the lead in <i>Freaky Friday</i>.

17:29.591 --> 17:31.926
You can do the workshop
when you come back from the tour.

17:32.010 --> 17:34.012
It could be years until the next one.

17:34.095 --> 17:36.806
Even better.
That way, you can keep editing your novel.

17:36.890 --> 17:38.683
Why are you in such a hurry? Hmm?

17:40.352 --> 17:42.228
What's up with you?

17:42.312 --> 17:44.564
We already discussed this.

17:44.647 --> 17:48.276
Mini Cocó left your body.
We did the exorcism, remember?

17:48.360 --> 17:49.611
[laughs]

17:49.694 --> 17:53.114
Well, uh, I'm going to change.
Can you watch the printer?

17:56.159 --> 17:57.327
Don't let the paper jam.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.079
Yes, yes, of course. Go ahead.

18:00.663 --> 18:01.664
[sighs]

18:17.931 --> 18:18.932
[gasps]

18:25.271 --> 18:28.775
Laura. I can't decide. Pants or skirt?

18:29.401 --> 18:30.402
Pants.

18:31.820 --> 18:33.822
[continues printing]

18:38.368 --> 18:40.161
[gasps, exhales]

18:40.245 --> 18:41.413
[heavy sigh]

18:44.374 --> 18:45.834
Jeans or corduroy?

18:46.376 --> 18:47.877
Mm. Jeans.

18:48.753 --> 18:50.755
[continues printing]

19:02.017 --> 19:05.020
[beeping, continues printing]

19:23.705 --> 19:25.457
[TV: voices indistinct]

19:25.540 --> 19:27.334
Projection mapping has only been seen

19:27.417 --> 19:29.377
in installation art
and underground pieces.

19:29.461 --> 19:32.422
It's never been used
in a professional theater.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.424
It's perfect.

19:34.507 --> 19:37.177
Imagine the scene where
Ellie and Kathrine switch bodies.

19:37.260 --> 19:39.137
It will be stunning.

19:39.220 --> 19:40.263
Yes. Absolutely.

19:40.347 --> 19:41.931
We're going to make history.

19:42.015 --> 19:46.019
But we need specialized designers,
computer experts.

19:46.102 --> 19:47.354
There's no time.

19:47.437 --> 19:49.397
I suggest you get moving right away.

19:49.939 --> 19:51.066
The budget.

19:51.900 --> 19:55.653
Of course.
Not an insignificant detail. [chuckles]

19:58.615 --> 20:00.492
[stutters] Whoa.

20:02.160 --> 20:03.620
No, no, no. It's okay.

20:03.703 --> 20:07.082
It's just that it's a little higher
than I had imagined.

20:07.165 --> 20:10.460
A lot.
No, no, well, the show is worth it, right?

20:10.543 --> 20:12.462
Sure. Perfect, right?

20:12.545 --> 20:14.756
[video continues, indistinct]

20:14.839 --> 20:15.840
All right.

20:19.594 --> 20:21.304
No! No!

20:21.388 --> 20:23.181
Could I be more clumsy?

20:23.264 --> 20:26.935
Sorry, it's my fault. I was calling my mom
to let her know I was going to be late.

20:27.686 --> 20:29.562
That's it. The printer's broken.

20:30.522 --> 20:33.441
-What happened?
-I tripped and knocked the printer down.

20:33.525 --> 20:36.986
I don't know. What do I do? I can't go
to the interview without my writing.

20:37.070 --> 20:39.280
It's all right. Don't worry.
Everything happens for a reason.

20:39.364 --> 20:42.325
Maybe it's a sign you need
to stick with the company.

20:43.743 --> 20:44.744
Caterina?

20:46.830 --> 20:48.206
Where did you find those?

20:48.289 --> 20:51.918
Did you forget that you had printed me
a copy to read? Eh?

20:52.002 --> 20:54.212
But it doesn't have
the latest changes you made.

20:54.295 --> 20:56.339
It doesn't matter, Grandma.
You're the best.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.383
I don't know how to thank you.

20:58.466 --> 21:02.595
Well, as long as you put some gardenias
on my tomb from time to time, I'm happy.

21:02.679 --> 21:04.014
Don't joke about that.

21:04.097 --> 21:06.307
I have to go to the Clover Café.
It's super late.

21:06.391 --> 21:07.976
-Thank you, thank you.
-Good. Go.

21:12.188 --> 21:13.273
-[door shuts]
-[sighs]

21:13.356 --> 21:16.526
[printer continues, abruptly stops]

21:18.194 --> 21:19.529
[Caterina] <i>Allegra!</i>

21:20.030 --> 21:21.489
<i>We're back.</i>

21:21.573 --> 21:23.408
NOBODY WAS HERE.
I WILL COME BACK NEXT WEEK.

21:23.491 --> 21:26.202
The client. He says nobody was here.
He'll come back next week.

21:26.286 --> 21:27.871
Well, no big deal.

21:28.705 --> 21:31.207
On top of that, she left a big mess.

21:32.083 --> 21:33.793
I don't know
how you can tell the difference.

21:33.877 --> 21:36.671
A hurricane could pass through,
and it'd leave everything more organized.

21:36.755 --> 21:37.756
[chuckles]

21:40.383 --> 21:42.886
Don't be angry at Allegra.
She probably had to go.

21:45.221 --> 21:48.350
I'm not angry. I'm-- I'm hurt.

21:49.267 --> 21:51.061
She knew this was important for me.

21:51.770 --> 21:54.856
But whenever I need her, she disappears.

21:57.609 --> 21:59.027
Do you need something?

21:59.778 --> 22:01.071
Can I make you tea?

22:02.072 --> 22:03.740
Why do you always offer me tea?

22:06.326 --> 22:09.621
I assume that's what people do
in situations like this.

22:11.247 --> 22:13.249
It's my way of showing empathy.

22:17.462 --> 22:19.714
If you have something to say to me,
say it.

22:21.466 --> 22:22.967
In my dictionary,

22:23.051 --> 22:28.223
"empathy" and "consideration"
are antonyms of Cocó Sharp.

22:30.475 --> 22:32.018
Sometimes you are so cruel.

22:34.604 --> 22:36.064
Do you know what today is?

22:40.193 --> 22:41.986
Of course you don't…

22:43.446 --> 22:45.699
because the only thing
you care about is yourself.

22:55.291 --> 22:56.960
[door opens, bell jingles]

22:58.128 --> 22:59.421
[door shuts]

23:01.381 --> 23:02.382
Nice suit.

23:03.633 --> 23:04.801
Is everything all right?

23:06.094 --> 23:07.095
Yes.

23:08.430 --> 23:10.473
I don't know. You?

23:11.725 --> 23:13.476
You're never going to speak to me again?

23:15.228 --> 23:16.604
What do you want me to say?

23:17.605 --> 23:20.066
I know what I did at CD Room was wrong.

23:20.150 --> 23:22.777
Yes, I was overexcited.
That's why I didn't check with you two.

23:22.861 --> 23:24.404
Don't worry. It's no problem.

23:25.530 --> 23:29.409
We just lost the opportunity to record
our first demo, right? No big deal.

23:31.828 --> 23:32.996
I came to apologize.

23:33.872 --> 23:36.458
Can we call a truce? Please.

23:37.334 --> 23:40.003
What happened? Why the long face?

23:40.545 --> 23:43.298
Did your dad give you
your own office at the bank?

23:44.758 --> 23:46.509
It's Laura. I don't know.

23:46.593 --> 23:48.762
Day of the gig, she disappeared.
I haven't seen her since.

23:49.971 --> 23:51.473
Don't worry. No big deal.

23:52.057 --> 23:54.726
Another blemish on your track record
isn't as bad as it seems, right?

23:54.809 --> 23:56.478
Welcome to the losers club.

23:57.020 --> 23:59.856
Oh, great. Now you take pleasure
in your friend's failures.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.816
[laughs]

24:01.900 --> 24:04.361
Maybe she disappeared
because you're a bad kisser.

24:04.444 --> 24:08.948
No. It's my understanding that to date,
I haven't received any complaints.

24:09.032 --> 24:11.076
[all laugh]

24:11.159 --> 24:13.203
-I'm an ace in that department.
-Oh, yeah?

24:13.286 --> 24:16.873
Look. The first time I kissed Caterina,
she went crazy.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.875
You should've seen her face.

24:18.958 --> 24:22.003
It took her a whole minute
to pull herself together.

24:23.963 --> 24:26.549
I'd love for you
to continue telling me about this,

24:26.633 --> 24:28.718
but I have more important things
to think about.

24:29.386 --> 24:31.721
How to track down the fugitive?

24:32.305 --> 24:34.599
I went to her house,
and it's not her house.

24:34.683 --> 24:36.559
Her mom is not her mom.

24:36.643 --> 24:39.145
I don't know. Laura lied to me.

24:40.021 --> 24:43.566
-Marco Resco is in love.
-No.

24:43.650 --> 24:46.236
I can't believe it. I honestly
never thought this day would come.

24:46.319 --> 24:47.445
I'm not in love.

24:48.780 --> 24:49.781
I'm worried.

24:49.864 --> 24:51.574
Worried? [scoffs]

24:51.658 --> 24:54.369
-[phone rings]
-Don't lie to me like you lie to your dad.

24:57.831 --> 24:58.957
Hello?

24:59.040 --> 25:00.125
Yes.

25:00.625 --> 25:02.252
Mr. Juaz?

25:04.838 --> 25:07.340
Yes, of course we're interested
in recording the demo.

25:07.424 --> 25:09.426
-What?
-No.

25:11.052 --> 25:13.471
The Clover Café

25:14.556 --> 25:16.641
[Oliverio]
<i>Your premise is very interesting.</i>

25:17.350 --> 25:19.519
Yes, it's very personal.

25:20.103 --> 25:22.230
An autobiographical novel?

25:23.148 --> 25:25.525
Did you fall in love with a time traveler?

25:25.608 --> 25:26.860
No, no.

25:26.943 --> 25:30.238
It's based on stories
my grandma told me when I was little.

25:31.322 --> 25:35.118
No. Caterina wouldn't dare.
You must've misheard.

25:35.201 --> 25:36.536
I promise you I didn't.

25:36.619 --> 25:38.872
The workshop
is at the same time as the tour.

25:38.955 --> 25:42.500
If she's chosen,
she'll quit Eleven O'Clock.

25:43.752 --> 25:45.086
[Oliverio] <i>How interesting.</i>

25:45.170 --> 25:49.424
So, you were
going for a short-story structure.

25:49.507 --> 25:51.968
Actually, I used a binary structure.

25:52.052 --> 25:55.472
My idea was that the two stories
would complement each other

25:55.555 --> 25:59.434
and that the reader would approach
the stories from different perspectives.

25:59.517 --> 26:02.437
I told her not to do it,
but she wouldn't listen.

26:02.520 --> 26:06.608
That's why I came to you, because I think
that together we can change her mind.

26:07.192 --> 26:08.401
You did the right thing.

26:09.069 --> 26:10.862
Actually, this is an older version.

26:10.945 --> 26:13.073
And why didn't you bring me the latest?

26:14.407 --> 26:17.118
I had technical difficulties.

26:17.202 --> 26:18.661
Where's Caterina now?

26:19.162 --> 26:20.830
She's meeting with Oliverio Gerard.

26:22.165 --> 26:25.126
Perfect. I'll take care of it.

26:25.210 --> 26:26.670
I'll see you later at rehearsal.

26:26.753 --> 26:28.380
[phone rings]

26:31.049 --> 26:32.842
Mr. Gerard, there's a phone call for you.

26:35.553 --> 26:37.138
-Excuse me.
-Mm-hmm.

26:41.309 --> 26:42.811
[exhales deeply]

26:43.895 --> 26:46.815
-Hello?
-<i>Oliverio, it's Cocó Sharp calling.</i>

26:46.898 --> 26:50.276
Cocó! What a surprise.
How did you know I was here?

26:50.360 --> 26:53.988
[chuckles] You spend much more time
at that café than you do at home.

26:54.072 --> 26:56.866
<i>Yes, that's true, that's true.</i>
<i>The noise inspires me.</i>

26:56.950 --> 26:59.452
But to what do I owe
the pleasure of your call?

26:59.536 --> 27:01.413
<i>You're meeting with my daughter, right?</i>

27:02.455 --> 27:04.416
Caterina is your daughter?

27:04.499 --> 27:06.376
That's strange. She didn't say anything.

27:06.459 --> 27:08.336
Does she know we go way back?

27:08.420 --> 27:11.172
<i>No, and I'd prefer that it stays that way.</i>

27:12.132 --> 27:15.051
Oliverio,
I wanted to propose something to you.

27:15.135 --> 27:18.555
Your last work,
I'd like to adapt it for musical theater.

27:18.638 --> 27:21.725
Of course,
I would give you a noteworthy advance.

27:23.643 --> 27:24.686
<i>Are you there?</i>

27:24.769 --> 27:27.647
Yes. Yes, yes, of course. It's just,

27:27.731 --> 27:28.982
<i>I didn't expect it.</i>

27:29.858 --> 27:31.401
<i>I'd like that very much, of course.</i>

27:31.484 --> 27:34.154
Why don't we discuss it?

27:34.779 --> 27:38.074
<i>Before that,</i>
<i>I need to ask you a big favor.</i>

27:43.747 --> 27:46.249
Marco. You're here super early.

27:49.044 --> 27:50.337
What's up?

27:50.420 --> 27:52.630
No, I'm waiting to see
if you'll disappear again.

27:53.882 --> 27:54.883
Let me explain.

27:57.385 --> 27:59.679
I happened to see the time
and realized it was super late.

27:59.763 --> 28:02.015
-If my mom noticed I wasn't at home--
-Right, your mom.

28:02.098 --> 28:03.850
The one who has no idea who you are?
That one?

28:03.933 --> 28:05.352
What?

28:05.435 --> 28:07.312
I went to your house to talk to your mom.

28:09.314 --> 28:10.607
Why did you lie to me?

28:14.235 --> 28:16.279
My mom is very, very strict,

28:16.363 --> 28:20.033
and she always wants to know
where I am, who I'm with,

28:20.116 --> 28:21.576
what I'm doing.

28:23.787 --> 28:27.624
I'd be embarrassed if you met her.
That's why I didn't take you to my house.

28:30.126 --> 28:31.127
I get it.

28:31.211 --> 28:32.754
[sighs]

28:32.837 --> 28:35.590
It's the same with my dad.
We don't get along.

28:35.674 --> 28:38.093
All he cares about
is that I do what he wants.

28:38.176 --> 28:39.928
-It's exhausting.
-Exhausting.

28:40.011 --> 28:41.054
[both laugh]

28:42.430 --> 28:44.933
Diego put ideas in my head that maybe,
I don't know,

28:45.016 --> 28:47.352
it was that you thought
I was a bad kisser.

28:47.435 --> 28:49.813
[chuckles] Caterina said the same thing.

28:50.480 --> 28:51.564
They're the worst.

28:52.649 --> 28:56.695
So does that mean you liked the kiss?

28:59.739 --> 29:01.032
Where is Marco Resco?

29:01.116 --> 29:03.576
The know-it-all? Have you seen him around?

29:06.996 --> 29:08.081
Let's do something.

29:10.291 --> 29:11.543
Put this on.

29:13.128 --> 29:14.546
Come on. It's a surprise.

29:17.882 --> 29:19.676
I'm sorry for the interruption.

29:19.759 --> 29:22.303
-Is everything all right?
-Huh? Yes.

29:22.387 --> 29:24.222
Yes, yes, yes, everything's--

29:24.305 --> 29:26.683
It's nothing.
Don't-- Don't worry about it.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.102
Personal matters.

29:30.270 --> 29:32.605
Uh, where were we?

29:32.689 --> 29:34.899
I was going to tell you about
the milestones in the story.

29:34.983 --> 29:37.402
-Yes. I don't want to lie to you.
-Hmm?

29:37.485 --> 29:40.864
You have good material,
and I see a lot of potential in you.

29:40.947 --> 29:43.199
Thank you. You don't know
how much it means to hear that.

29:43.283 --> 29:47.579
Yes, well, the thing is
that you still have a long way to go.

29:48.913 --> 29:50.915
Yes. Yes, yes. I know I need to improve.

29:50.999 --> 29:53.043
But if you give me the opportunity,
I'll give it everything…

29:53.126 --> 29:55.086
Yes, look, I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

29:57.505 --> 30:01.259
You're not ready for my workshop.

30:07.724 --> 30:09.392
Okay, a few more steps.

30:09.476 --> 30:14.356
Be careful with the sharks
and the crocodiles and the sinkholes.

30:14.439 --> 30:15.440
Now, don't move.

30:15.982 --> 30:17.817
I hate you so much right now.

30:17.901 --> 30:19.319
You're hiding it very well.

30:20.236 --> 30:23.490
Let me remind you that you were the one
who looked all over town for me.

30:23.573 --> 30:25.283
Can I take this off now?

30:25.367 --> 30:26.493

Oh, good. The couple of the year.

31:52.746 --> 31:53.997
I never asked you.

31:54.622 --> 31:57.834
How do you feel about having
gotten into the company by accident?

31:57.917 --> 32:00.503
Hmm. It's better than being
the understudy, that's for sure.

32:00.587 --> 32:02.672

32:03.757 --> 32:06.176
"Ellie's friend number 13"?

32:06.259 --> 32:08.178
The number 13 is bad luck. I'm number six.

32:08.261 --> 32:10.513
Laura, I need to speak with you.
Come with me.

32:16.519 --> 32:18.313
Your luck is about to run out.

32:19.981 --> 32:21.858
Well, I just wanted to tell you that--

32:22.567 --> 32:23.860
[male student] Excuse me.

32:25.195 --> 32:27.238
[Cocó] Thanks to the information
you gave me,

32:27.322 --> 32:29.949
I was able to act swiftly
and avoid a disaster.

32:30.033 --> 32:31.409
What are you talking about?

32:32.243 --> 32:33.536
Don't worry about that.

32:33.620 --> 32:36.998
The important thing is that Caterina
will no longer have any distractions,

32:37.082 --> 32:40.001
and she'll be able to focus entirely
on Eleven O'Clock.

32:41.419 --> 32:43.713
It was a wise choice to have made you
a part of the company.

32:45.048 --> 32:47.425
Thank you. That means a lot to me.

32:48.301 --> 32:49.302
Thank you.

32:55.517 --> 32:57.060
It's not what you think.

Let's wait a few more minutes until
Caterina arrives, and then we'll start.

33:14.077 --> 33:15.829
What could have happened
to your friend now?

33:15.912 --> 33:18.373
I injured myself
because they couldn't wait 30 seconds,

33:18.456 --> 33:21.459
and for Caterina, the whole world stops
for as long as it takes.

33:22.210 --> 33:23.211
Pathetic.

33:23.294 --> 33:26.214
There's no comparing, sweetie.
She's the opening day lead.

33:26.297 --> 33:27.924
[man] No, not like this, no.

33:31.803 --> 33:34.014
Caterina,
you're late and haven't even changed?

33:34.097 --> 33:35.598
Go get ready. We'll speak later.

33:35.682 --> 33:38.518
No. I'm not changing.

33:39.644 --> 33:41.771
Caterina,
I'm not in the mood for your antics.

33:41.855 --> 33:45.025
And I've had enough of you meddling
in my life and manipulating me.

33:46.651 --> 33:48.069
I'm done.

33:48.653 --> 33:50.530
I quit Eleven O'Clock.

33:50.613 --> 33:52.198
[students murmuring]

33:53.533 --> 33:55.535
Don't be absurd.

33:55.618 --> 33:56.911
Don't joke about that.

33:56.995 --> 33:59.372
It's not a joke. I am being very serious.

34:00.457 --> 34:03.626
If you quit the company, you're going
to regret it for the rest of your life.

34:04.210 --> 34:05.211
Maybe,

34:05.795 --> 34:08.298
but at least it'll be my life.

34:08.882 --> 34:11.551
I am not interested
in being the new Cocó Sharp.

34:23.021 --> 34:24.230
[Allegra] It's my fault.

34:24.314 --> 34:27.817
I warned you. You didn't listen to me.
And now it's too late.

34:28.401 --> 34:31.905
If you're trying to make me feel worse,
congratulations. It's working.

34:32.947 --> 34:34.324
Want to know the worst part?

34:34.407 --> 34:37.494
Cocó did the same thing to my mom
that she's now doing to me.

34:43.958 --> 34:45.293
What are you going to do?

34:47.003 --> 34:50.507
I thought that by changing my mom's past,
she'd support me in the present.

34:50.590 --> 34:52.634
But you could say
you weren't very considerate

34:52.717 --> 34:54.260
about what she wanted, right?

34:55.553 --> 34:57.222
I'll stop talking now.

34:57.305 --> 34:59.391
No, maybe you're right.

34:59.474 --> 35:01.017
I'm the worst.

35:01.101 --> 35:04.104
Come on. It's not like you knew what
Cocó was going to do, you know?

35:04.187 --> 35:05.897
If I hadn't told her
about the literary workshop--

35:05.980 --> 35:08.525
Well, it happened.
It's in the past. Let it go.

35:08.608 --> 35:10.735
Now we have to think about the future.

35:10.819 --> 35:12.862
Yes, the future of the past.

35:13.738 --> 35:15.407
Yes, subtitles, please.

35:15.490 --> 35:17.450
I need to travel to the past now.

35:17.534 --> 35:20.578
If only I had a remote control
to activate you when I need you.

35:20.662 --> 35:23.873
Yes, but Lucía told you
that you couldn't control the bracelet.

35:24.916 --> 35:25.917
Lucía.

35:26.418 --> 35:27.502
What about Lucía?

35:27.585 --> 35:29.546
-Today is the 24th, right?
-Yes.

35:30.922 --> 35:32.966
That's why my mom
was so strange this morning.

35:33.049 --> 35:34.884
How could I not have realized?
I have to go.

35:34.968 --> 35:35.969
No, but…

35:38.221 --> 35:41.099
The past with the future.
