- [Laughing] Hey, I knew you'd come.
- [Door closes]

00:57.307 --> 00:59.557
All right. You're a sight for sore eyes.

00:59.593 --> 01:00.759
You're looking good.

01:00.811 --> 01:02.010
- [Buzzer]
- Jimmy.

01:02.012 --> 01:03.228
Sorry you had to come all this way.

01:03.263 --> 01:04.646
It's a long way, right?

01:04.681 --> 01:07.398
- It's a long way.
- Yeah. Sorry.

01:07.434 --> 01:09.818
Only two things I know about Albuquerque...

01:09.853 --> 01:12.437
Bugs bunny should have
taken a left turn there.

01:12.489 --> 01:15.440
And give me 100 tries,
I'll never be able to spell it.

01:15.492 --> 01:18.693
[Laughs]

01:18.695 --> 01:22.113
Anyway. [sighs] As you can see,

01:22.165 --> 01:24.749
I'm in a... A bit of a pickle.

01:24.785 --> 01:27.368
- You certainly are.
- [Chuckles]

01:27.370 --> 01:30.588
Forget the property damage
and assault charges.

01:30.624 --> 01:33.341
You face being labeled
a sex offender, Jimmy.

01:33.376 --> 01:34.709
If that happens,

01:34.711 --> 01:35.927
it'll follow you for the rest of your life.

01:35.962 --> 01:38.763
That is insane, okay?

01:38.799 --> 01:41.766
Th... That is a trumped-up load
of horse crap, Chuck.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.802
- Come on.
- Is that what I tell the judge...

01:43.854 --> 01:45.019
"Trumped-up load of horse crap"?

01:45.055 --> 01:46.354
I'm not the lawyer here, okay?

01:46.389 --> 01:48.189
But it was a simple Chicago sunroof.

01:48.225 --> 01:50.809
Sex offender? That's not even remotely a...

01:50.861 --> 01:53.645
[Scoffs, sighs]

01:53.697 --> 01:56.648
Let's talk strategy, okay?

01:56.700 --> 01:58.867
'Cause I need you to work your magic

01:58.902 --> 02:01.152
and make this whole situation go poof.

02:01.204 --> 02:04.789
You got a plan of attack? Huh? Come on.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.624
I know I haven't made it easy for you,

02:06.660 --> 02:10.829
but you are... you are the man!

02:10.881 --> 02:14.465
Right? I know you got
a million legal loopholes

02:14.501 --> 02:18.887
that we can dance through...
Big bag of tricks, you know?

02:18.922 --> 02:22.090
Any clever technicalities, huh?

02:22.092 --> 02:27.011
And reasonable-doubt type stuff?
Come on, Chuck.

02:27.063 --> 02:30.231
I haven't seen you in what, five years?

02:30.267 --> 02:32.851
We barely hear from you.

02:32.903 --> 02:35.270
Now that you're in it up
to your neck, you can't even

02:35.272 --> 02:37.071
call me yourself... you have <i> mom</i> call me?

02:37.107 --> 02:39.073
Mom took it upon herself to call you!

02:39.109 --> 02:40.909
I was just letting her know where I was.

02:40.944 --> 02:43.912
- You didn't cry to her on the phone?
- What? No.

02:43.947 --> 02:46.331
You didn't cry and beg mom for help?

02:46.366 --> 02:48.199
What? Jesus!

02:48.251 --> 02:50.618
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?

02:50.620 --> 02:52.170
I'm gonna cry on a pay phone

02:52.205 --> 02:53.955
in the middle of cook county jail.

02:53.957 --> 02:56.591
Jesus!

02:56.626 --> 03:02.430
Can we... can we talk strategy here, huh?

03:02.465 --> 03:05.049
Look... [sighs]

03:05.101 --> 03:08.269
I know I'm a lousy brother.

03:08.305 --> 03:09.888
[Sniffs]

03:09.940 --> 03:12.891
I'm a lousy brother. I'm a big screw-up.

03:12.943 --> 03:16.110
And if I was just a better person,

03:16.146 --> 03:19.314
I would not only stop letting <i> you</i> down...

03:19.316 --> 03:22.734
You know what? I'd stop letting <i> me</i> down.

03:22.786 --> 03:24.569
And it's about time

03:24.621 --> 03:28.406
that I started to make both of us proud.

03:28.458 --> 03:29.874
Am I right?

03:29.910 --> 03:31.075
- Guard.
- Wait.

03:31.127 --> 03:33.077
Chuck, wait, wait, wait, wait.

03:33.129 --> 03:35.079
No, no. You can't leave me. No.

03:35.131 --> 03:38.499
If I... if I don't get
out of this, my life is over!

03:40.637 --> 03:43.588
So long as you understand that.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.006
Yeah.

03:45.008 --> 03:48.426
Jimmy, if I do this...

03:48.478 --> 03:53.898
<i>If...</i> Do not make a fool out of me.

03:53.934 --> 03:57.318
I promise I won't.

03:57.354 --> 03:58.686
Everything you're doing,

03:58.688 --> 04:01.322
everything you're involved
with... that's over.

04:01.358 --> 04:05.526
[Exhales sharply] Just tell me what to do.

04:05.528 --> 04:09.163
[Voice breaking]
Whatever it is, I'll do it.

04:09.199 --> 04:12.000
Just say it.

04:12.035 --> 04:14.669

hey, what you doing?

What?

06:24.865 --> 06:26.197
Wait, you think that's the only reason

06:26.199 --> 06:27.616
I would call you at this time of night?

06:27.668 --> 06:29.451
I mean, can you just give me...

06:29.503 --> 06:31.286
Give me a little bit of credit, okay?

06:31.338 --> 06:33.288
And you're not talking dirty to me, either.

06:33.340 --> 06:35.123

- I knew it.

06:35.175 --> 06:38.510
Uh, joking. Just... just joking,
having fun with you.

06:38.545 --> 06:40.345
I am calling you tonight

06:40.380 --> 06:45.350
with quality PG phone

06:48.355 --> 06:54.225

and drive straight over,

06:54.227 --> 06:55.610
limited time only,

06:55.646 --> 06:58.113
I'm offering a free pedicure and foot bath.

06:58.148 --> 07:01.950

Hey, more for me. [Clears throat]

07:06.406 --> 07:10.375
Uh, you're, uh, probably swamped
with work anyways,

07:10.410 --> 07:13.545
what, with that big, fat, giant case

07:13.580 --> 07:14.763
falling right into your lap.

07:14.796 --> 07:16.963
- Which case is that?
- I don't know.

07:17.015 --> 07:19.966

or something?

07:20.018 --> 07:22.385

07:22.387 --> 07:23.636
Craig Kettleman.

07:23.688 --> 07:25.638
Craig Kettleman, yeah!

07:25.690 --> 07:27.140
The primo client your dipwad boss

07:27.192 --> 07:28.641
stole right out from under me.

07:28.693 --> 07:32.946
Nobody stole anybody.
The Kettlemans made a choice.

07:32.981 --> 07:35.365
Yeah, so did the donner party
when they took that shortcut.

07:35.400 --> 07:37.984
Come on, Jimmy. Hamlin is <i> not</i> that bad.

07:38.036 --> 07:42.622
And I'm gonna be second chair
if it ever goes to trial, so...

07:42.657 --> 07:44.290
Be happy for me.

07:44.326 --> 07:49.913
Hey, um, how much exactly
did Kettleman get away with?

07:49.915 --> 07:53.550
Uh, excuse me,
innocent until proven guilty?

07:53.585 --> 07:56.553
Uh, excuse <i> me,</i> but I'm
a taxpayer in this county.

07:56.588 --> 07:58.755
I think I have a right to know.

07:58.757 --> 08:02.308
And besides, it's not like
I'm his lawyer or anything.

08:02.344 --> 08:05.311
I have to go to sleep. So do you.

08:05.347 --> 08:07.013
I know you have court in the morning.

08:07.065 --> 08:10.650
He got away with $1 million,
$1.6 million, at least?

08:10.685 --> 08:13.653
I'm not talking details
of the case with you. Goodnight.

08:13.688 --> 08:15.438
Where do you stash all that dough?

08:15.440 --> 08:17.690
I mean, besides for buying
that idiotic boat.

08:17.742 --> 08:19.325
Hello, guilty.

08:19.361 --> 08:20.743
Hanging up now.

08:20.779 --> 08:24.747
This guy's... yeah, he's probably a target.

08:24.783 --> 08:28.585
Somebody might get some bad, bad ideas.

08:28.620 --> 08:31.204
You know, if Kettleman
isn't careful with that money,

08:31.256 --> 08:34.207
I mean [sighs] his whole family
could be in danger.

08:34.259 --> 08:36.092
What do you mean, "danger"?

08:36.126 --> 08:39.929
Jimmy, why would you say that?

08:39.965 --> 08:42.347
What?

08:42.384 --> 08:46.553
You said the family might be in danger.

08:46.605 --> 08:49.772
I did? I... oh, I, uh...

08:49.808 --> 08:52.392
[Clears throat]
I'm... I'm drunk. [Chuckles]

08:52.444 --> 08:56.229
So, I'm just, uh... I'm thinking out loud.

08:56.281 --> 09:00.450
I'm... I'm up, spinning, uh...
Spinning thoughts.

09:00.485 --> 09:02.652
- You sure?
- Yeah.

09:02.654 --> 09:06.289
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh...

09:06.324 --> 09:11.711
So, I will see you
down in the court bowels <i>Mañana.</i>

09:11.746 --> 09:13.713

Okay. Okay.

14:06.204 --> 14:09.038
But hear me out. Wow.

14:09.040 --> 14:11.040
The 30 he's done, which is a 60 credit,

14:11.042 --> 14:12.875
plus 60 additional days.

14:12.877 --> 14:14.710
Can't do it.

14:14.712 --> 14:18.347
Best offer... six months,
plus the time he's done,

14:18.382 --> 14:20.349
half time for good behavior... out in 90.

14:20.384 --> 14:22.551
- That's my final.
- That's never gonna happen.

14:22.553 --> 14:25.771
Oh! Come on. Now, are you joking?

14:25.806 --> 14:27.623
Now, that is the best deal
you're gonna get.

14:27.658 --> 14:30.025
- [Air blowing]
- I can't do it.

14:30.061 --> 14:32.311
Your guy drove drunk into a shopping center

14:32.363 --> 14:33.646
and killed three people.

14:33.698 --> 14:36.699
Wait. Shopping center? Desmond Rojas.

14:36.734 --> 14:38.868
Armed robbery, liquor store.

14:38.903 --> 14:41.737
He assaulted a cashier
with a bottle of Kahlúa.

14:41.739 --> 14:43.572
Oh.

14:43.574 --> 14:45.491
I was thinking of Daryl Redwood.

14:45.543 --> 14:48.827
Yeah, okay. My bad.
Desmond Rojas. Okay, go.

14:48.880 --> 14:50.412
Start over.

14:50.414 --> 14:51.964
I am not starting over.

14:51.999 --> 14:53.799
I'm busting my nut here
every day for 700 a throw,

14:53.834 --> 14:55.334
inhaling your B.M.,

14:55.386 --> 14:57.303
which is straight from Satan's bunghole,

14:57.338 --> 15:00.306
and you can't tell one
defendant from another?!

15:00.341 --> 15:03.726
90 days with good behavior...
We're doing this.

15:03.761 --> 15:05.728
Yeah. Okay, yeah.

15:05.763 --> 15:08.347
Say it. Say the words, "I accept the deal."

15:08.399 --> 15:11.267
Yeah, I... I accept... I accept the deal.

W... what do you mean, what did I mean?

15:30.121 --> 15:34.123
I... I... no, I told you.
I... I was drunk. I just...

15:36.127 --> 15:39.962
Kim, why are you...
Why are you asking me this?

- [Tires screech]
- Oh, damn it.

15:42.633 --> 15:44.183
Here. I'm in a real rush.

15:44.218 --> 15:46.518
I didn't have time to get the validation.

15:46.554 --> 15:49.388
- Fine. 9 bucks.
- [Sighs]

15:51.976 --> 15:55.144
I... I don't have it.

15:55.146 --> 15:57.146
I have $5. Please?

15:57.148 --> 15:59.565
You know the drill...
Money or the validation.

15:59.617 --> 16:01.400
Look, this is an emergency, okay?

16:01.452 --> 16:02.818
A serious, serious emergency.

16:02.820 --> 16:04.653
I have to get out of here.

16:04.655 --> 16:07.072
I promise, on the souls of my forefathers,

16:07.124 --> 16:09.291
I will get you the stickers
when I come back.

16:09.327 --> 16:12.745
I will get you extra if you just let me go.

16:13.914 --> 16:15.714
Fine!

16:15.750 --> 16:18.133
Fine! You're gonna make me
walk back and get the stickers?!

16:18.169 --> 16:21.337
I will walk back and get the stickers!

16:21.339 --> 16:24.974
I'm not <i> making</i> you do anything.
Those are the rules.

16:25.009 --> 16:27.643

Me? Uh...

17:38.588 --> 17:40.472
Uh, I... I was surfing the police scanner.

17:40.486 --> 17:42.870
I heard there was big activity
out this way.

17:42.905 --> 17:45.322
Well, there's no business for
you here, so maybe next time.

17:45.375 --> 17:47.908
Uh, it was a home invasion?
Uh, the Kettlemans okay?

17:47.910 --> 17:50.127
Uh, we don't know.

17:50.163 --> 17:51.545
A neighbor was walking the dog last night

17:51.581 --> 17:53.381
and saw the front door wide open.

17:53.416 --> 17:55.583
The place was ransacked.
No sign of the family.

17:55.585 --> 17:59.303

We're still figuring it out.

17:59.338 --> 18:01.722

I'm just supporting a friend
in her time of need.

18:20.743 --> 18:23.661
You want to be supportive? Tell me why
you said those things last night.

18:23.696 --> 18:25.246
I'm just reading tea leaves,

18:25.281 --> 18:26.864
same way I knew
the Kettlemans needed a lawyer.

18:26.916 --> 18:28.282
All that money floating out there...

18:28.284 --> 18:30.419
It's logical somebody would come after it.

18:30.483 --> 18:33.234
So, the same night you worry
about them, they... Disappear?

18:33.286 --> 18:36.385
Yeah, it's crazy. It's "Ripley's."

18:36.585 --> 18:39.586
Jimmy, it's not just Craig
and Betsy Kettleman...

18:39.588 --> 18:41.921
It's their two kids, as well.

18:41.923 --> 18:46.009
You would... Say something if
you could help find them, right?

18:48.013 --> 18:50.180
I don't... I don't know
what happened to them.

18:50.232 --> 18:52.599
Really, I d... I don't know.

18:52.601 --> 18:54.601
The longer you stay here,

18:54.603 --> 18:56.069
the more explaining I have to do to Hamlin.

18:56.104 --> 18:57.687
I'll talk to you later.

the FBI in on this,

which makes it federal.

26:01.613 --> 26:03.329
That's a bad thing, Nacho.

26:03.364 --> 26:04.947
That's... that's very bad,

26:04.999 --> 26:07.033
but if you tell me where the family is,

26:07.035 --> 26:08.835
if... if you give them up now...

that you can get behind?

- You set me up.
- I what?

27:01.089 --> 27:03.256
You gave my score to another crew,

and now you're setting me up.

had nothing to do with this?

what time they went to bed... all that.

27:26.447 --> 27:29.865
They were fine when I left. That's it.

27:29.918 --> 27:32.501
You had nothing to do with the Kettlemans?

all they're gonna find is the

<i>you</i> leaked out when you were in there.

27:50.138 --> 27:54.523
Nobody's been in the
back of that van since.

27:54.559 --> 27:58.945
[Sighs] I... I don't understand.

27:58.980 --> 28:03.950
Here's what <i> I</i> understand, counselor.

28:03.985 --> 28:08.154
I told my plan to one other person.

28:08.156 --> 28:11.374
One... you.

28:11.409 --> 28:14.377
Now here I am, under arrest.

28:14.412 --> 28:16.379
- Go figure.
- [Sighs]

28:16.414 --> 28:19.382
I don't know anything
about a setup or another crew.

28:19.417 --> 28:20.750
[Chuckles]

28:20.802 --> 28:23.386
[Chains rattle]

28:23.421 --> 28:26.389
You know what? I don't even care.

28:26.424 --> 28:29.392
The cops are out there right
now, poking into my business,

28:29.427 --> 28:34.230
and if they find something on me
or my partners, for real,

28:34.265 --> 28:38.684
it's gonna be bad for you... really bad.

28:40.521 --> 28:43.739
Bad? Bad as in...

28:43.775 --> 28:47.743
You get me out of here, today...

28:47.779 --> 28:50.112
Or you're a dead man.

29:02.405 --> 29:04.989
[Knock on door]

29:05.041 --> 29:07.241
[Beep]

29:11.330 --> 29:14.131
Oh, hey.

29:14.166 --> 29:15.716
I asked if you knew anything.

29:15.765 --> 29:18.266
You didn't tell me you were
representing the lead suspect.

29:18.268 --> 29:19.817
I didn't know it at the time.

29:19.853 --> 29:21.269
Dunst: He give up anything?

29:21.271 --> 29:24.906
- What?
- Did he tell you where the family is?

29:24.941 --> 29:26.324
[Sighs] H... he doesn't know.

29:26.359 --> 29:27.942
What does that mean... he doesn't know?

29:27.944 --> 29:29.410
He gave them to somebody else?

29:29.445 --> 29:30.828
He... he doesn't know
because he didn't do it.

29:30.864 --> 29:32.163
Ah, Christ. Give me a break.

29:32.198 --> 29:34.749
Guys, can you give us just a minute?

29:37.754 --> 29:41.122
Jimmy, that family is in real danger.

29:41.124 --> 29:43.541
You don't have to stand behind
attorney-client privilege.

29:43.593 --> 29:44.659
I'm not.

29:44.745 --> 29:46.627
These people can be buried in a box,

29:46.629 --> 29:48.045
sucking air through a straw right now.

29:48.097 --> 29:49.881
And I'm sorry if that's where they are,

29:49.933 --> 29:51.299
but my guy didn't do it.

29:51.301 --> 29:53.718
How are you so sure?

29:53.770 --> 29:54.936
[Sighs]

29:54.971 --> 29:56.437
You know what you're gonna do?

29:56.472 --> 29:58.639
You're gonna get
your special CSI people, right?

29:58.641 --> 30:00.641
And you're gonna test the
blood from that van,

30:00.643 --> 30:02.476
because I guarantee you,
one billion percent,

30:02.478 --> 30:03.945
it's not the Kettlemans'.

30:03.980 --> 30:05.563
Whose is it?

30:05.615 --> 30:08.199
I... It's not the Kettlemans'. Just test it.

30:08.234 --> 30:09.817
That'll take weeks,

30:09.819 --> 30:11.819
if we could even get
a DNA sample to compare it to.

30:11.821 --> 30:14.539
Well, isn't that convenient?

30:14.574 --> 30:17.625
You've got an innocent man
in there right now,

30:17.660 --> 30:19.744
who I demand you release with an apology!

30:19.796 --> 30:21.829
Dunst: Look, there are no other suspects.

30:21.831 --> 30:24.665
There's no evidence
that points to anyone else.

30:24.667 --> 30:26.417
Well, then, I want to see the crime scene,

30:26.469 --> 30:28.052
'cause you guys are missing something.

30:28.068 --> 30:29.837
Screw you, "missing something."

30:29.839 --> 30:34.058
No, detectives, I, um...
I think that's a good idea.

30:34.093 --> 30:35.977
- A good idea?
- Yes.

30:36.012 --> 30:38.563
I think we should invite
Mr. McGill to the house.

30:38.598 --> 30:39.564
[Scoffs] Why?

30:39.599 --> 30:41.816
Yeah, why?

30:48.608 --> 30:50.575
So, what did we miss?

30:50.610 --> 30:52.610
[Clock ticking]

31:06.542 --> 31:09.543
[Sighs]

31:13.383 --> 31:17.802
This is the son's room...
Warren. 12 years old.

31:28.648 --> 31:31.866
[Sighs]

31:34.064 --> 31:37.238
Jo Jo's room.

31:37.240 --> 31:39.824
She's 7.

31:44.914 --> 31:48.883
[Sighs]

31:48.918 --> 31:51.085
All right, you wanted me to crack?

31:51.087 --> 31:53.087
Mission accomplished.

31:53.089 --> 31:55.723
But I'm telling you...
My client didn't do this.

31:55.758 --> 31:57.558
We know Varga was outside the house

31:57.593 --> 31:59.393
the night the family
disappeared. That is a fact.

31:59.429 --> 32:01.512
Advocate for the guy all you want

32:01.564 --> 32:03.931
after we get these people back safe.

32:03.933 --> 32:06.567
In the meantime, help us.

32:06.602 --> 32:08.319
Where's the doll?

32:08.354 --> 32:10.154
Where's the what?

32:10.189 --> 32:13.357
Uh, got little shoes, a bunch of clothes,

32:13.409 --> 32:14.992
a table and chairs, hairbrush,

32:15.028 --> 32:16.827
but where's the doll
that goes with all this stuff?

32:16.863 --> 32:18.663
In every picture of this little girl,

32:18.698 --> 32:20.197
she's holding the same doll.

32:20.249 --> 32:23.034
- So, where's the doll?
- What does it matter?

32:23.086 --> 32:25.252
Doll is gone... girl is gone,

32:25.288 --> 32:27.088
which means doll and girl
are most likely together,

32:27.123 --> 32:28.339
which means...

32:28.374 --> 32:29.840
I have no idea what that means.

32:29.876 --> 32:32.209
Which means the kid
wasn't dragged out of the house.

32:32.261 --> 32:34.178
- Ipso facto...
- Wait. Wait.

32:34.213 --> 32:36.013
What are you saying?

32:36.049 --> 32:39.884
Maybe the Kettlemans kidnapped themselves.

32:42.388 --> 32:44.972
That's it. You're...
You're... you're done. Let's go.

32:44.974 --> 32:47.108
- I... it makes perfect sense.
- How does it make sense?

32:47.143 --> 32:48.526
Why would they do that?

32:48.561 --> 32:51.612
They stole a million dollars-plus, right?

32:51.647 --> 32:53.230
You... you want to get away
with all that yummy cash,

32:53.282 --> 32:55.066
what do you do? Run? No, you can't.

32:55.118 --> 32:58.736
If you run, everyone knows
you're guilty. Ah!

32:58.788 --> 33:02.289
But if you're kidnapped,
you're a victim, right?

33:02.325 --> 33:04.492
They staged this to throw everyone off.

33:04.494 --> 33:06.994
[Scoffs] You guys are
looking in the wrong place.

33:06.996 --> 33:09.997
Who knows how many miles into
Mexico or Canada they could be?

33:09.999 --> 33:12.833
You... you got to put the word out.

33:12.835 --> 33:14.251
Oh, co... come on.

33:14.303 --> 33:16.554
You don't think it's possible I'm right?

33:16.589 --> 33:18.556
It's possible... unlikely.

33:18.591 --> 33:21.759
- Unlikely?
- All their cars are here.

33:21.811 --> 33:24.595
There's no record of a taxi
or car service to the house,

33:24.647 --> 33:27.398
and they didn't get on any
planes or buses or trains.

33:27.433 --> 33:29.350
- You checked all that?
- Yes, we checked it.

33:29.352 --> 33:32.103
And the doll... it's not news.
We saw it was missing.

33:32.155 --> 33:33.237
So where is it?

33:33.272 --> 33:35.072
The girl was scared, crying.

33:35.108 --> 33:37.108
Bad guy lets the kid
take the doll to shut her up.

33:37.160 --> 33:39.744
What?

33:39.779 --> 33:42.163
You don't think <i>that's</i> possible?

33:42.198 --> 33:47.001
I need to talk to you alone.

33:47.036 --> 33:49.620
I've got to tell you something on the Q.T.,

33:49.672 --> 33:51.038
and promise not to be upset with me.

33:51.040 --> 33:53.257
No way am I making that promise.

33:53.292 --> 33:54.875
I called the Kettlemans.

33:54.877 --> 33:56.710
After I hung up with you,
I gave them a warning call.

33:56.712 --> 33:58.462
A warning call?

33:58.514 --> 34:00.881
Yeah, I was worried my guy Varga
was going after their money.

34:00.883 --> 34:03.300
And he was. He was gonna rip them off.

34:03.352 --> 34:05.970
I deduced it from a
conversation that we had.

34:06.022 --> 34:07.555
It was lawyer to client,

34:07.557 --> 34:09.774
so there was, you know,
confidentiality issues.

34:09.809 --> 34:13.476
But I called the Kettlemans
anonymously to warn them.

34:13.529 --> 34:14.645
Anonymously?

34:14.697 --> 34:17.063
You didn't... oh, God, you didn't...

34:17.065 --> 34:18.699
You didn't do the sex-robot voice, did you?

34:18.734 --> 34:21.118
I did, with the tube and the whole thing,

34:21.154 --> 34:23.987
which probably scared
the living shit out of them,

34:24.040 --> 34:25.822
and they took off, which, you know,

34:25.875 --> 34:27.958
file that under "unintended consequences,"

34:27.994 --> 34:31.161
but you... you believe me now?

34:31.214 --> 34:33.797
- Uh...
- Great.

34:33.833 --> 34:35.416
Now we have to find them.

34:35.418 --> 34:40.254
I mean... or, better yet,
get the cops to let Varga go

34:40.255 --> 34:43.556
because right now my ass is
on a highway to the danger zone.

34:43.592 --> 34:44.925
Well, why are you in danger?

34:44.927 --> 34:47.812
Nacho Varga... he didn't kidnap the family.

34:47.847 --> 34:51.431
But he's a bad guy. He's a very bad guy.

34:51.434 --> 34:53.434
And if the cops keep pushing him,

34:53.436 --> 34:54.819
they're gonna find something.

34:54.853 --> 34:56.437
And when that happens, Nacho blames me,

34:56.438 --> 35:00.741
and then his guys turn me
into a meat piñata.

35:00.776 --> 35:02.493
Jimmy, tell the police.

35:02.528 --> 35:04.328
No, there's n... there's no way
I'm gonna rat on this guy.

35:04.363 --> 35:06.330
I will <i> never</i> be safe.

35:06.365 --> 35:08.782
No, I have to convince the cops
that I'm right,

35:08.784 --> 35:10.534
get them to stop looking at Nacho,

35:10.586 --> 35:12.336
and catch the Kettlemans on the run.

35:12.371 --> 35:13.871
And if they never catch them?

35:13.923 --> 35:15.706
The Kettlemans?

35:15.758 --> 35:17.258
Well, you've met these people, right?

35:17.293 --> 35:19.677
They're... they're not exactly
masterminds, right?

35:19.712 --> 35:22.096
They will be caught if the cops
are looking for them,

35:22.131 --> 35:24.098
so you tell them to, would you?

35:24.133 --> 35:26.300
The FBI, too... I heard
they're getting in on this.

35:26.302 --> 35:28.602
Why would the FBI listen to <i> me?</i>

35:28.638 --> 35:30.221
Well, Hamlin...
They'll listen to him, right?

35:30.273 --> 35:33.057
APD, at least. Y...
You... you talk to Howard.

35:33.109 --> 35:34.942
You explain things to him.

35:34.977 --> 35:36.527
He has clout with these people.

35:36.562 --> 35:38.062
What? Is... is that a no or...

35:38.114 --> 35:39.563
Hamlin will never agree to it.

35:39.615 --> 35:41.148
The Kettlemans are our clients.

35:41.150 --> 35:43.067
This would mean incriminating them.

35:43.119 --> 35:46.070
Oh, you... you see? This is why
people hate lawyers. [scoffs]

35:46.122 --> 35:49.490
It's Hamlin's call,
and Hamlin will never agree.

35:49.492 --> 35:53.327
And even if it were up to me,
you know I couldn't.

35:53.329 --> 35:55.546
I'm sorry. I just...

35:55.581 --> 35:57.414
I get it.

36:01.671 --> 36:03.053
Where are you going?

36:03.089 --> 36:04.672
I'm gonna go talk to Nacho.

36:04.674 --> 36:08.092
I'll try to make him see reason.

36:08.144 --> 36:10.895
To beg!

36:10.930 --> 36:14.765
[Brakes squeal]

36:14.817 --> 36:17.184
[Beep]

36:17.186 --> 36:18.652
Come on.

36:18.688 --> 36:20.771
Come on!

36:20.823 --> 36:23.407
[Button clicking]

36:23.442 --> 36:26.694
[Sniffs]

36:29.332 --> 36:33.117
Right. Yeah. Hey. [Clears throat]

36:33.169 --> 36:35.536
I was a jerk, okay?

36:35.538 --> 36:39.173
So, I will...
I will pay you what I owe you,

36:39.208 --> 36:41.625
plus interest,
if you just let me come through.

36:46.549 --> 36:49.967
I suggest you find parking somewhere else.

36:50.019 --> 36:52.386
Somewhere else, as in...
Where somewhere else?

36:52.388 --> 36:53.721
Not my concern.

36:53.723 --> 36:55.723
Uh, actually, uh, this is your job,

36:55.725 --> 36:57.725
so, by definition, it's your concern.

36:57.727 --> 37:01.946
So pump out the ticket and open
the stupid gate already, please.

37:01.981 --> 37:05.783
I mean, I don't have time for this.

37:05.818 --> 37:09.203
- [Horn honks]
- [Scoffs]

37:09.238 --> 37:12.406
All... [sighs]

37:12.408 --> 37:14.625
All right!

37:14.660 --> 37:17.411
[Horn honking]

37:17.413 --> 37:21.248
Hey. I'm gonna...
I'm gonna park right here.

37:21.250 --> 37:23.584
I don't think you want to be doing that.

37:23.586 --> 37:26.320
Oh, yeah?

37:26.355 --> 37:28.505
What are you gonna do? You got
a poop-filled diaper in there?

37:28.557 --> 37:30.341
Are you gonna throw it at me?

37:30.393 --> 37:33.594
You gonna gum me to death, huh, geezer?

37:33.596 --> 37:34.845
Ohh! Whoa, ow!

37:34.897 --> 37:37.264
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ohh! Ohh!

37:37.266 --> 37:38.649
Ow! Ow!

37:41.501 --> 37:43.919
We're talking about a family...
Mom, dad, two kids.

37:45.400 --> 37:47.566
Lawyer's got this bullshit theory

37:47.602 --> 37:50.186
about them staging this
and running off with the money.

37:50.238 --> 37:51.487
You know the story?

37:51.522 --> 37:53.105
Yeah, county treasurer embezzled funds.

37:53.107 --> 37:53.757
I read the paper.

37:53.806 --> 37:55.973
Yeah, well, we got this
gangbanger dead to rights.

37:56.025 --> 37:59.810
Only problem is your guy over there.

37:59.862 --> 38:03.230
He needs to help us get
his scumbag client to talk.

38:03.232 --> 38:05.483
So, what do you say? You on board?

38:05.535 --> 38:07.535
Help us do some good.

38:10.072 --> 38:11.455
Sure.

38:11.491 --> 38:13.073
Okay, here's the deal...
You assaulted this man.

38:13.075 --> 38:15.075
Give me a break. I barely touched the guy.

38:15.077 --> 38:16.911
But you laid hands on him first.

38:16.913 --> 38:19.411
<i>Finger...</i> I laid <i> finger</i> on him.

38:19.611 --> 38:21.444
Well, whatever your interpretation,

38:21.479 --> 38:21.945
it was still an assault.

38:22.010 --> 38:24.313
Now, this gentleman
is willing to let this go,

38:24.315 --> 38:25.948

38:25.984 --> 38:27.016
You got to get your client

38:27.083 --> 38:28.602

38:28.647 --> 38:32.032
Wait, guys, I'm the definition
of a broken record on this one.

38:32.067 --> 38:34.901
Nacho is "not-cho" man, <i>comprendo?</i>

38:34.903 --> 38:38.321
Nobody took the Kettlemans.
The Kettlemans took themselves!

38:38.373 --> 38:41.541
You're gonna keep playing
that line, it's gonna go rough.

38:41.577 --> 38:44.377
[Sighs] You know what? Do your worst.

38:44.413 --> 38:46.079
All right, let's go... to booking.

38:46.081 --> 38:47.547
Yeah, sure.

38:47.583 --> 38:48.665
- Fine.

38:48.717 --> 38:50.083
Perfect end to a perfect day.

38:50.085 --> 38:52.469
Hey, guys, wait a second.
I changed my mind.

38:52.504 --> 38:54.888
- I'm sorry. What?
- I don't want to press charges.

38:54.923 --> 38:57.724
We talked about this.
You <i> want</i> to press charges.

38:57.759 --> 39:00.143
No. No, I don't.

39:00.179 --> 39:02.262
What are you doing, buddy?
I thought you had our backs.

39:02.264 --> 39:06.349
No, I don't think I said that, buddy.

39:06.401 --> 39:08.568
So, what... you get a chance to do
the right thing and you puss out?

39:08.604 --> 39:09.986
Mm...

39:10.022 --> 39:13.740
Yeah. Well, I guess it's my loss.

39:15.611 --> 39:18.245
Hey, Cagney, Lacey.

39:18.280 --> 39:20.864
When you realize how wrong
you are about all this,

39:20.916 --> 39:22.699
I'll take an edible
arrangement as a "sorry."

39:28.624 --> 39:30.590
Hey. Hold up.

39:30.626 --> 39:32.592
How come you let me
off the hook back there?

39:32.628 --> 39:34.427
Look, I'm going back to work.

39:34.463 --> 39:36.429
Why don't you quit while
you're ahead and go on your way?

39:36.465 --> 39:38.431
No, I refuse to believe it's because

39:38.467 --> 39:40.851
you have something resembling
a heart inside your body.

39:40.886 --> 39:42.853
You're not gonna have
a heart inside <i> your</i> body

39:43.972 --> 39:45.188
Okay, don't tell me, all right?

39:45.224 --> 39:46.806
I already know why you did it.

39:46.808 --> 39:49.142
Yeah? Why is that?

39:49.144 --> 39:51.144
'Cause you believe me.

39:51.146 --> 39:53.446

All right, I believe you.

39:57.402 --> 39:59.569
I knew it! I knew it!

39:59.621 --> 40:01.204
Finally, someone believes me!

40:01.240 --> 40:04.374
[Laughs] W... why do you believe me?

40:04.409 --> 40:06.660
I heard the details.
Your story makes sense.

40:06.662 --> 40:08.662
Of course it does! But... [snaps fingers]

40:08.664 --> 40:11.081
Devil's advocate... like the cops said,

40:11.133 --> 40:12.916
uh, the Kettlemans' cars
are still at their house.

40:12.968 --> 40:14.251
There's no record of them leaving.

40:14.303 --> 40:16.253
H... how'd they get out of the country?

40:16.305 --> 40:17.754
They didn't.

40:17.806 --> 40:19.389
Odds are, they didn't
get out of their neighborhood.

40:19.424 --> 40:21.224
What? What? They... come again?

40:21.260 --> 40:25.228
Look [sighs] when I was still
on the job back in Philly,

40:25.264 --> 40:26.646
we had this case...

40:26.682 --> 40:28.398
Whoa, hold up. [chuckling] Hold up.

40:28.433 --> 40:31.234
Now, wait. "On the job," as in
you were a cop on the job?

40:31.270 --> 40:35.238
This bookie disappeared
after the super bowl...

40:35.274 --> 40:39.492
Cowboys/steelers... took $6 million in bets

40:39.528 --> 40:41.328
and skipped town
when things didn't go his way.

40:41.363 --> 40:43.613
Now, everybody thought he was
on the beach in the Bahamas

40:43.665 --> 40:48.451
or dead in the Jersey
pine barrens... wasn't the case.

40:48.503 --> 40:52.505
He was two doors down from where
he lived in a foreclosed house.

40:52.541 --> 40:55.842
Hid there for six months
without anyone suspecting.

40:55.877 --> 40:57.877
But... but why? Why not run?

40:57.879 --> 41:00.714
Now, that's what everybody expects.

41:00.716 --> 41:03.550
It's human nature
to want to stay close to home,

41:03.552 --> 41:05.769
and if this Kettleman
figured out how to do it,

41:05.804 --> 41:08.188
that's what he did.

41:11.310 --> 41:13.893
