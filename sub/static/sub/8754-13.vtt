WEBVTT

00:10.732 --> 00:13.833
She does not like children, whatsoever.

00:13.935 --> 00:16.703
My son said he's seen the
floor covered with blood.

00:16.805 --> 00:19.005
She gets him at night, for sure, for sure.

00:19.107 --> 00:21.340
He stabs her 27 times with a screwdriver.

00:21.443 --> 00:23.409
This guy really did a job on her.

00:23.511 --> 00:27.180
She would torture the [bleep] out of them.

00:27.282 --> 00:29.816
I want...
I want normalcy in our lives again.

00:29.918 --> 00:32.118
People should not live here.

00:33.021 --> 00:36.489
She just wants this person dead.

00:36.591 --> 00:39.158
Something bad's going to happen.

00:39.260 --> 00:41.060
My name is Amy Allan.

00:41.162 --> 00:42.161
There's panic.

00:42.263 --> 00:44.063
And it's almost like a butchering.

00:44.165 --> 00:45.565
I see dead people.

00:45.667 --> 00:47.834
They all died horribly.

00:47.936 --> 00:49.535
I speak to dead people.

00:49.637 --> 00:50.636
Get out of here.

00:50.739 --> 00:52.105
And they speak to me.

00:52.207 --> 00:53.940
Vicious.

00:54.042 --> 00:57.043
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:57.145 --> 00:58.845
It doesn't matter where you are.
I'll find you.

00:58.947 --> 01:00.313
I rely on my partner.

01:00.415 --> 01:01.581
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:01.683 --> 01:04.117
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:04.218 --> 01:05.685
This guy's a real piece of work.

01:05.770 --> 01:08.955
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:09.057 --> 01:10.206
I feel like I live in a house of Hell.

01:10.325 --> 01:12.225
It's my job to reveal them.

01:12.327 --> 01:13.760
This is not good.

01:13.862 --> 01:15.495
But Steve and I never speak...

01:15.597 --> 01:17.630
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:17.732 --> 01:19.599
Until the very end...

01:19.701 --> 01:20.950
I want my life back.

01:21.035 --> 01:23.035
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:23.138 --> 01:24.604
Is he trying to kill her?

01:24.689 --> 01:25.905
Or time to get out.

01:26.007 --> 01:27.440
Oh, my God.

01:27.542 --> 01:29.075
This is going to kill us.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.074

01:41.756 --> 01:42.872
I'm in Delmont, Pennsylvania.

01:42.957 --> 01:45.341
It's about 25 miles east of Pittsburgh.

01:45.426 --> 01:47.527
I got a call from a desperate mother.

01:47.662 --> 01:49.862
She says the activity
is so bad in the house,

01:49.964 --> 01:51.130
she spends every night

01:51.232 --> 01:53.499
with her three kids
sleeping in the living room.

01:53.601 --> 01:56.118
She thinks the activity is
destroying their childhood,

01:56.237 --> 01:59.155
and if we can't help her out,
someone's going to get hurt.

02:04.012 --> 02:05.461
Before Amy arrives,

02:05.580 --> 02:08.981
I clear the area of any
leading information.

02:09.083 --> 02:12.935
Family photos and personal items
can influence her findings,

02:13.054 --> 02:15.738
so it's important that I
cover or remove them all.

02:15.824 --> 02:19.308
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

02:29.304 --> 02:30.002
Wow, boy.

02:30.104 --> 02:33.506
There's a male, definitely.

02:33.608 --> 02:38.044
I think he did really awful things.

02:38.179 --> 02:40.630
He had a lot of issues with women,

02:40.715 --> 02:43.449
like any kind of involvement with women

02:43.551 --> 02:46.452
didn't really go very well.

02:47.922 --> 02:49.555
And then, like, someone else is saying...

02:49.657 --> 02:53.059
You know, like... you know,
people should not live here.

02:53.161 --> 02:56.178
It's been bad for a very long time.

03:01.035 --> 03:03.569
So, Melissa,
on the phone you sounded pretty desperate

03:03.655 --> 03:05.705
for myself and my partner to come out here.

03:05.807 --> 03:06.839
What's going on?

03:06.925 --> 03:09.292
Since day one that we moved in here,

03:09.377 --> 03:11.644
I knew we weren't alone in this house.

03:11.779 --> 03:14.814
And it's just progressively
just gotten worse.

03:14.899 --> 03:16.282
My husband sleeps upstairs.

03:16.384 --> 03:19.118
My children and myself sleep in this room.

03:19.203 --> 03:21.020
My kids will not sleep in their rooms.

03:21.122 --> 03:22.655
Well, that can't be great for the marriage.

03:22.757 --> 03:23.923
Yeah. I mean, I should be able to

03:24.025 --> 03:26.025
sleep in my room with my husband,

03:26.127 --> 03:28.628
but I'm frightened of what
it could do to my kids.

03:28.713 --> 03:30.846
Who exactly lives in the house?

03:30.965 --> 03:32.632
It's my husband, me.

03:32.700 --> 03:34.901
This is my daughter, Samone. She's 9.

03:34.986 --> 03:39.338
This is my son, Mason,
and this is our baby, Cyrus.

03:39.424 --> 03:40.823
Let me ask you a question
about the house itself.

03:40.909 --> 03:42.541
Do you know any of its history or anything?

03:42.677 --> 03:46.195
This was my husband's grandfather's house,

03:46.281 --> 03:47.930
so we are the third generation.

03:48.049 --> 03:50.132
I actually have a picture
of it if you want to see,

03:50.251 --> 03:53.252
from, I believe, the 1800s.

03:53.354 --> 03:55.104
- Wow.
- Yeah.

03:55.223 --> 03:57.974
Okay,
so give me a run-down of what's going on.

03:58.092 --> 04:00.860
Noises, voices,

04:00.962 --> 04:03.629
horrible nightmares, and apparitions.

04:03.715 --> 04:05.031
You feel like it's something threatening?

04:05.116 --> 04:06.532
Definitely.

04:06.634 --> 04:09.619
I think there's something very nasty here.

04:09.737 --> 04:11.070
How well are you dealing with this?

04:11.155 --> 04:13.222
I'm exhausted and I'm drained,

04:13.341 --> 04:15.608
and I've had chronic health
problems for over five years

04:15.693 --> 04:18.543
which no doctor could tell
me what was wrong with me.

04:18.646 --> 04:21.163
It feels like my body's shutting down.

04:21.281 --> 04:22.481
Either we're going to go

04:22.567 --> 04:25.134
or something bad's going to happen.

04:25.253 --> 04:27.420
I know you were desperate
for Amy and I to come here.

04:27.555 --> 04:29.989
What would be the best outcome for you?

04:34.562 --> 04:36.562
I want...
I want normalcy in our lives again.

04:36.698 --> 04:39.165
It's hard. Being sick is hard.

04:39.300 --> 04:41.467
And I do feel like this house
has a lot to do with it.

04:41.602 --> 04:42.885
My kids can't deal with it anymore.

04:43.004 --> 04:44.837
I can't deal with it anymore.

04:44.922 --> 04:46.339
My husband can't deal with it anymore.

04:46.424 --> 04:49.859
It's just, like,
I'd rather just pack up and go,

04:49.978 --> 04:52.028
and just to start over, you know?

04:52.113 --> 04:54.213
- We're here to try to fix that.
- I know.

04:54.298 --> 04:58.267
I was feeling so desperate and hopeless.

04:58.386 --> 05:01.087
I mean, and I'm ready to fight it,
whatever it is.

05:03.675 --> 05:08.461
This guy, like,
as far as his interaction with women,

05:08.563 --> 05:12.798
is a problem here, you know?

05:12.884 --> 05:14.900
He's a real creepy creep.

05:15.003 --> 05:17.737
He's, like,
kind of on your back all the time

05:17.839 --> 05:21.774
stalking, following, watching, watching.

05:21.876 --> 05:23.442
Are they aware of it at all?

05:23.528 --> 05:24.844
I think so.

05:24.946 --> 05:28.180
Like, going through ladies' stuff,
underwear,

05:28.316 --> 05:32.034
you know,
watching them get dressed or undressed.

05:32.120 --> 05:36.088
It's a feeling of, like,
I'm going to the bathroom.

05:36.190 --> 05:37.556
I'm being watched.

05:37.658 --> 05:40.760
Like, skeevy, skeevy perv-o.

05:45.366 --> 05:46.699
Why'd you bring me in this room?

05:46.801 --> 05:48.968
Uh, this is the room we all sleep in.

05:49.053 --> 05:50.086
It's no way for anybody to live.

05:50.204 --> 05:52.488
No, not when we have a
big house with rooms.

05:52.573 --> 05:54.306
So, I'm curious about yourself.

05:54.442 --> 05:56.308
What experiences have you had?

05:56.444 --> 05:57.910
When I was walking through

05:57.995 --> 06:01.213
the second floor hallway upstairs

06:01.299 --> 06:04.550
a very large black shadow

06:04.685 --> 06:05.634
moved right in front of the door

06:05.720 --> 06:07.303
when I was trying to cross through.

06:07.422 --> 06:08.437
I ran out into the hallway

06:08.523 --> 06:10.356
and there was nothing there, nobody there.

06:10.441 --> 06:12.892
Is it possible that the shadow
did come in from outside?

06:12.977 --> 06:14.026
No, 'cause it was up in that hallway,

06:14.112 --> 06:15.194
there's no windows or anything.

06:15.279 --> 06:16.896
- Was anybody in the house with you?
- No.

06:16.981 --> 06:19.598
It scared me to death, you know? It did.

06:19.684 --> 06:20.983
So, anything else going on?

06:21.102 --> 06:22.101
My son just woke up the other day

06:22.236 --> 06:23.452
and had a big bruise on his side.

06:23.571 --> 06:24.653
I wake up with bruises.

06:24.739 --> 06:26.839
I mean, my daughter's woken
up with scratches on her.

06:26.924 --> 06:28.841
And that's in this so-called
safe room you're in.

06:28.926 --> 06:30.109
Mm-hmm.

06:30.244 --> 06:33.913
Could that be as a result
of tossing and turning?

06:34.015 --> 06:36.749
No, I mean, everyone's on a soft,
cushy surface

06:36.851 --> 06:38.651
and away from each other.

06:38.736 --> 06:40.886
Are you afraid there's
something attacking you, guys?

06:40.988 --> 06:42.688
It's crossed my mind.

06:42.790 --> 06:43.956
Because if that's the case,

06:44.041 --> 06:45.624
then it takes it to a whole 'nother level.

06:47.795 --> 06:51.464
I see two women...
an older one and a younger one.

06:51.566 --> 06:54.567
The younger one's angry with me.

06:54.652 --> 06:55.935
Dead guy is yelling,

06:56.020 --> 06:59.605
and he says she's a spiteful little [bleep]

06:59.707 --> 07:02.908
Who doesn't know her place
and doesn't know manners,

07:03.010 --> 07:05.494
and she needs to be regulated?

07:07.215 --> 07:11.016
She does not like children whatsoever.

07:11.119 --> 07:14.620
She doesn't look at them
like they're human.

07:14.705 --> 07:16.555
And I think that's a big problem

07:16.657 --> 07:20.042
if there's any children in this house.

07:20.161 --> 07:24.163
She would literally torture
the [bleep] out of them.

07:30.471 --> 07:32.655
So, Jimmy,
I was talking to your wife about

07:32.773 --> 07:35.040
a lot of things that your
kids are going through.

07:35.143 --> 07:37.059
She also told me that

07:37.145 --> 07:39.028
the house has been in
your family a long time.

07:39.147 --> 07:40.579
- Yeah.
- Do you know how long?

07:40.681 --> 07:42.882
Since, uh, 1952, I believe.

07:42.967 --> 07:44.300
Did you spend time here as a kid.

07:44.385 --> 07:45.684
Yes, I spent a lot of time here.

07:45.770 --> 07:50.506
Here's a picture of when
I was, I believe, 5

07:50.591 --> 07:51.690
with my grandfather.

07:51.792 --> 07:53.893
We were fishing down here at the creek,

07:53.978 --> 07:56.095
and I caught a 17-inch rainbow trout.

07:56.197 --> 07:58.330
- So you had good memories.
- Oh, yeah.

07:58.416 --> 07:59.632
Your kids aren't having

07:59.767 --> 08:01.800
the nice times that you had, though.

08:01.936 --> 08:04.003
No, my kids are afraid to
go anywhere in the house.

08:04.088 --> 08:06.272
From what they said,
I can't blame them either, you know?

08:06.357 --> 08:07.273
Right.

08:07.358 --> 08:10.142
You know any history about the house?

08:10.228 --> 08:12.511
My grandmother died in the house.

08:12.647 --> 08:17.216
From what I've been told,
is she had bone cancer.

08:17.301 --> 08:20.119
She committed suicide.

08:20.204 --> 08:20.819
In the house?

08:21.956 --> 08:23.656
In the room next to us, and that's where...

08:23.791 --> 08:25.157
Right here?

08:25.293 --> 08:26.525
That's where Mason and Samone

08:26.627 --> 08:28.844
both have their dreams about

08:28.930 --> 08:31.480
where they swear they've
seen things in there.

08:31.599 --> 08:32.865
My son, multiple times,

08:32.950 --> 08:36.368
has said he's seen the
floor covered with blood.

08:42.043 --> 08:43.342
It's just tough.

08:43.427 --> 08:44.710
It's just things that kids shouldn't,

08:44.795 --> 08:46.679
you know, even talk about.

08:46.781 --> 08:48.847
And that's why I agreed to all this.

08:48.933 --> 08:50.482
Have you had experiences?

08:50.568 --> 08:53.919
I was sleeping and next thing you know

08:54.055 --> 08:55.054
I woke up, like bouncing, you know...

08:55.139 --> 08:56.722
like it felt like

08:56.807 --> 08:58.924
I got picked up to the ceiling and dropped.

08:59.026 --> 08:59.959
I come straight out of the room.

09:00.061 --> 09:01.710
My wife said I was white as a ghost.

09:01.796 --> 09:04.730
Strangest thing I've ever had happen to me.

09:04.815 --> 09:06.999
- Do you suffer from seizures?
- No.

09:07.101 --> 09:08.500
- Nothing like that?
- No.

09:08.586 --> 09:09.501
Were you drinking heavy that night

09:09.587 --> 09:11.220
or anything like that?
No.

09:11.339 --> 09:13.956
That's the main reason that I said

09:14.075 --> 09:15.074
to contact you guys,

09:15.159 --> 09:18.727
is because there's no normalcy here at all.

09:18.846 --> 09:20.879
You know,
kids shouldn't have to feel this way

09:20.965 --> 09:22.298
or go through this stuff.

09:22.383 --> 09:23.415
Yeah.

09:23.501 --> 09:25.384
They should be allowed to just be kids.

09:33.361 --> 09:35.728
There's a lot of anger.

09:35.830 --> 09:39.531
There's a person yelling and screaming.

09:39.634 --> 09:44.703
Um, I saw the dead guy
doing stuff to a living guy.

09:47.174 --> 09:51.610
I actually see him touching a living male.

09:51.712 --> 09:54.463
I don't think that

09:54.582 --> 09:58.250
the living male appreciates this.

09:59.670 --> 10:05.257
So I'm seeing yelling...
yelling and screaming.

10:08.095 --> 10:11.096
Like, "Stop! I've had it!

10:11.198 --> 10:13.599
Stop! Leave me alone!

10:13.701 --> 10:17.236
Go away! Stop!"

10:37.543 --> 10:38.842
I was talking to Mommy earlier,

10:38.978 --> 10:40.310
and she was saying that
you and your brother

10:40.396 --> 10:41.812
were having a tough time.

10:41.897 --> 10:43.447
Yeah.

10:43.549 --> 10:45.382
Are you guys all sleeping
downstairs together?

10:45.484 --> 10:46.650
Yeah.

10:46.752 --> 10:48.819
Now,
can you tell me about some of the things

10:48.954 --> 10:50.487
that are making you afraid?

10:50.623 --> 10:58.112
Well,
I heard my door and dresser drawers slam

10:58.230 --> 11:00.230
and, um, this was when I was laying down

11:00.366 --> 11:03.350
getting ready to go to bed.

11:03.469 --> 11:04.852
Okay, is that part of the reason, you know,

11:04.970 --> 11:06.687
you sleep downstairs with Mom?

11:06.806 --> 11:11.508
No. I've seen mists in corners of the room.

11:11.610 --> 11:13.710
Okay, what kind of mist?

11:13.813 --> 11:16.713
Like, blackish that you can see through.

11:16.816 --> 11:19.283
Okay. Can you describe how it's shaped?

11:19.385 --> 11:21.718
It's shaped, like, usually in a circle.

11:21.804 --> 11:26.156
But sometimes it's in, like, weird shapes.

11:26.242 --> 11:27.624
Okay.

11:27.693 --> 11:29.993
Mommy mentioned something about
you guys having bad dreams.

11:30.096 --> 11:31.829
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

11:31.931 --> 11:34.298
What's going on with that?

11:34.400 --> 11:38.335
Well, I have dreams about...

11:38.471 --> 11:40.337
people chasing me in the house.

11:41.874 --> 11:43.607
They're usually grown-ups.

11:43.709 --> 11:44.908
Okay.

11:45.010 --> 11:46.593
And it's usually a man,

11:46.679 --> 11:48.846
but sometimes it's a woman.

11:48.948 --> 11:50.781
Do they say anything to you, honey?

11:50.916 --> 11:51.782
Mm-hmm.

11:51.884 --> 11:55.035
They say "I'm going to kill you."

12:00.860 --> 12:05.479
The younger lady,
she really hates kids.

12:05.564 --> 12:07.397
Absolutely despises them.

12:07.533 --> 12:12.369
Like, the energy she puts out is monstrous.

12:12.471 --> 12:14.838
And these kids can feel that.

12:14.940 --> 12:16.623
You know what I mean?

12:16.742 --> 12:19.209
It's weird too, because the older lady

12:19.295 --> 12:22.646
is really the one kind of ratting her out.

12:22.748 --> 12:24.081
Okay.

12:24.216 --> 12:26.850
I see her, like, as a darkness.

12:26.986 --> 12:28.068
Um, it's like the night.

12:28.187 --> 12:31.188
She gets them at night, for sure, for sure.

12:31.273 --> 12:33.106
Um...

12:50.976 --> 12:54.278
She's in here a lot.

12:54.380 --> 12:57.481
She comes in there a lot.

12:57.583 --> 13:00.450
She likes that doorway a lot.

13:02.821 --> 13:05.756
I see her sleeping in the bed.

13:05.858 --> 13:07.591
I think that this person,

13:07.676 --> 13:09.993
they used to be cuddled or caressed

13:10.095 --> 13:13.230
and then it got bad.

13:13.315 --> 13:17.334
It got frightening,
like clutched, being clutched.

13:20.005 --> 13:23.307
Cold, icy hands.

13:23.392 --> 13:25.842
Really bad. Really bad.

13:33.886 --> 13:35.819
So I was talking to Mommy earlier today.

13:35.921 --> 13:37.754
She told me that you and your sister

13:37.856 --> 13:38.722
are pretty scared.

13:38.824 --> 13:39.840
Yeah.

13:39.925 --> 13:42.509
There any reason why that you can tell me?

13:48.467 --> 13:50.767
That's kind of scary.

13:50.853 --> 13:55.205
Okay.
Is there anything else that scares you?

13:55.307 --> 13:59.142
I saw, like,
a white shadow coming down the stairs.

13:59.245 --> 14:00.377
Do you remember what it looked like?

14:00.512 --> 14:02.980
It looked like... I don't know.

14:03.082 --> 14:06.283
It was the shape of a... a man.

14:06.418 --> 14:07.951
Okay.

14:08.037 --> 14:09.836
So was that the only thing that scared you?

14:09.922 --> 14:11.622
No.

14:11.707 --> 14:13.457
I hear sounds a lot.

14:13.542 --> 14:17.594
Like, rattling and banging.

14:17.696 --> 14:18.762
It's coming from Mom's dressing room.

14:18.864 --> 14:21.131
- From Mom's dressing room?
- Yeah.

14:21.200 --> 14:22.366
Okay, it sounds like

14:22.451 --> 14:23.700
that kind of scares you then, huh?

14:23.802 --> 14:24.801
Yeah.

14:24.903 --> 14:27.471
I'll only go up here, like, sometimes

14:27.556 --> 14:29.389
when my mom's up here.

14:29.508 --> 14:30.474
- Okay.
- If nobody's up here,

14:30.559 --> 14:32.909
I won't go up here, especially at night.

14:33.045 --> 14:35.028
Especially at night, okay.

14:35.114 --> 14:37.414
We're gonna try and fix things,
me and my partner.

14:37.499 --> 14:38.799
And then you can come here all by yourself

14:38.884 --> 14:41.218
and just have a good time in your bedroom.

14:41.303 --> 14:42.719
That sound like a plan?

14:42.855 --> 14:44.538
Mm-hmm.

14:48.627 --> 14:51.111
There's a little boy.

14:51.230 --> 14:53.897
I don't know, maybe 8?

14:53.999 --> 14:55.499
Okay.

14:55.634 --> 14:57.134
And the younger woman,

14:57.236 --> 14:58.935
she's like this silhouette

14:59.021 --> 15:01.638
rushing back and forth between the rooms.

15:01.740 --> 15:04.474
It's like... like there's a weird noise

15:04.610 --> 15:08.312
like she's moaning or
screaming or something.

15:15.654 --> 15:17.738
These kids, they're both, you know,

15:17.823 --> 15:20.991
seeing this and hearing this.

15:21.093 --> 15:23.610
But I don't feel the clutching in here,

15:23.696 --> 15:28.732
the touching from her to this person.

15:28.801 --> 15:32.436
It's more like smothering,
much smothering in here.

15:34.907 --> 15:37.607
Much smothering.

15:37.710 --> 15:38.942
There's a weird relationship

15:39.044 --> 15:42.846
between her and that person in that room.

15:42.948 --> 15:46.216
But, here, she just wants this person dead.

16:00.457 --> 16:01.456
Jimmy doesn't know a lot about

16:01.591 --> 16:03.091
his grandmother's suicide in the house,

16:03.176 --> 16:05.727
but he said I could reach
out to some of his relatives.

16:05.829 --> 16:07.745
Turns out his aunt, the victim's daughter,

16:07.864 --> 16:10.615
was there minutes after
her mom shot herself.

16:19.008 --> 16:21.142
So, Kathy,
you grew up in that house, right?

16:21.244 --> 16:22.377
Yes.

16:22.479 --> 16:25.646
Did you ever experience
anything in the house

16:25.749 --> 16:27.648
- that you couldn't explain.
- I haven't.

16:27.734 --> 16:28.866
- You haven't?
- No.

16:28.985 --> 16:32.153
Okay. Now, your mom.
What kind of woman was she?

16:32.255 --> 16:34.522
Um, Mom was the best.

16:34.657 --> 16:37.525
There was never anything, in my world,

16:37.610 --> 16:40.828
she did wrong, ever.

16:40.914 --> 16:42.630
I have a picture of my mom.

16:42.716 --> 16:46.684
This was in the mid-to-late '50s.

16:46.770 --> 16:49.754
It was actually taken in
the living room there.

16:49.839 --> 16:52.106
Now, I understand your mom had gotten ill,

16:52.192 --> 16:52.807
is that correct?

16:52.892 --> 16:55.143
My mother got bone cancer.

16:55.245 --> 17:02.183
She was diagnosed with
it about 1981 or 1982,

17:02.285 --> 17:03.418
somewhere like that.

17:03.520 --> 17:04.919
My grandmother died of bone cancer,

17:05.021 --> 17:06.404
and I remember how painful that was.

17:06.522 --> 17:08.656
Very terrible.

17:08.758 --> 17:12.443
Just said, "Well, runs in the family.

17:12.529 --> 17:14.694
I guess it's my turn."

17:14.781 --> 17:18.266
And here's a picture of her
shortly before she died.

17:20.569 --> 17:22.069
I know it's gonna be tough to talk about,

17:22.204 --> 17:23.204
but can you take me through

17:23.289 --> 17:25.205
what happened the day your mom passed?

17:25.340 --> 17:30.678
The day mom died, um, I was working.

17:30.780 --> 17:33.965
I got a phone call from my dad.

17:34.050 --> 17:39.220
He says, "come quick, Mom's shot."

17:39.355 --> 17:42.857
Got here as quick as I can,
come into the house,

17:42.992 --> 17:47.245
and went upstairs, and
found her in her bed.

17:47.363 --> 17:51.232
- And with a gunshot wound?
- Yes.

17:51.317 --> 17:52.867
And seeing where the gunshot wound was,

17:52.952 --> 17:55.303
it went right through the brain stem.

17:55.405 --> 17:58.739
- She was gone.
- Okay.

17:58.842 --> 18:00.591
Yeah. I know.

18:00.677 --> 18:02.009
I'm sorry, honey.

18:05.715 --> 18:08.149
After all these years.

18:08.234 --> 18:09.350
It doesn't matter.

18:09.452 --> 18:11.219
You could be 80 years old

18:11.304 --> 18:12.720
and you'll still think about it.

18:12.856 --> 18:14.539
Mm-hmm.

18:20.530 --> 18:22.563
You all right?

18:24.734 --> 18:26.033
It's the older woman.

18:26.135 --> 18:29.103
She was sick, a lot.

18:30.740 --> 18:35.009
I'm trying to figure out
what exactly she had.

18:35.094 --> 18:39.146
She was, like,
very confused about where she was,

18:39.232 --> 18:43.184
what was happening, what's going on.

18:43.319 --> 18:44.852
Very, very dizzy.

18:44.988 --> 18:46.888
I do think the living would feel this...

18:46.990 --> 18:49.090
Passing out, fainting.

18:50.360 --> 18:52.159
Somebody got it in the head.

18:53.930 --> 18:56.531
Ah

18:58.768 --> 18:59.734
Now that I know Jimmy's grandmother

18:59.819 --> 19:02.470
committed suicide in the house,

19:02.605 --> 19:03.688
I need to see if there's anything else

19:03.806 --> 19:05.706
that could help my investigation.

19:05.808 --> 19:08.809
Searching through old records,
I find a strange story.

19:08.895 --> 19:11.412
It involves a woman who lived
right by my clients' property

19:11.514 --> 19:12.580
who got married

19:12.682 --> 19:14.582
only to have her husband kill himself

19:14.717 --> 19:16.217
a couple of days later.

19:16.319 --> 19:17.568
I called the local historian

19:17.687 --> 19:19.687
to look into this weird suicide for me.

19:19.822 --> 19:22.373
She called me back and said
there's a lot more to this story

19:22.458 --> 19:24.208
that will definitely help my case.

19:30.199 --> 19:32.466
So, Tracy,
before we get to this weird suicide,

19:32.552 --> 19:33.668
uh, you mentioned on the phone

19:33.753 --> 19:36.504
there was some interesting
stuff about his widow.

19:36.606 --> 19:37.605
What can you tell me?

19:37.707 --> 19:39.106
Her name is Mattie Waugaman,

19:39.208 --> 19:40.508
and she lived a few doors down

19:40.593 --> 19:42.426
from the property you're investigating.

19:42.545 --> 19:45.746
Her family had a very
successful tavern in Delmont.

19:45.848 --> 19:46.864
So she would have been

19:46.950 --> 19:48.783
a child of privilege in the area.

19:48.918 --> 19:50.284
All right. Did she do anything,

19:50.420 --> 19:51.786
or did she live off the parents' money?

19:51.871 --> 19:54.221
She was a seamstress,
but she had bigger plans.

19:54.324 --> 19:55.690
She wanted to make her own money

19:55.792 --> 19:57.541
and not live off of her dad's money.

19:57.627 --> 19:58.526
So she got involved in

19:58.628 --> 20:01.128
the Westmoreland County home scandal.

20:01.264 --> 20:02.296
What's that all about?

20:02.398 --> 20:04.115
She's in these rich homes,

20:04.233 --> 20:06.567
selling dresses,
making things for these ladies,

20:06.703 --> 20:09.770
and she's seeing some
things that maybe she wants.

20:09.872 --> 20:11.405
So probably took things here and there.

20:11.491 --> 20:12.540
She ever get charged?

20:12.625 --> 20:14.759
She did not, and she did
not serve any time.

20:14.877 --> 20:17.178
Okay, so now,
I saw in the article I came across

20:17.263 --> 20:19.263
- that she got married at 35.
- Mmhmm.

20:19.349 --> 20:20.648
I mean, which seems kind of late

20:20.733 --> 20:21.749
for that time period.

20:21.851 --> 20:23.951
Well, Mattie was a rebel.

20:24.037 --> 20:25.703
She got married late,

20:25.822 --> 20:28.623
and she had a child out of wedlock in 1873,

20:28.725 --> 20:30.324
and she named him Everett.

20:30.410 --> 20:32.059
So I could imagine in 1873,

20:32.161 --> 20:34.161
having a kid out of wedlock's
got to be a big to-do.

20:34.247 --> 20:35.296
Oh, absolutely.

20:35.381 --> 20:38.165
I mean,
even in the 1970s it was a big scandal.

20:38.251 --> 20:39.367
So just imagine the shame

20:39.502 --> 20:41.369
that was brought on her in that small town.

20:41.504 --> 20:43.070
So possibly
'cause it was a scandalous thing,

20:43.156 --> 20:44.572
nobody wanted to marry this girl.

20:44.707 --> 20:46.974
Well, in April of 1884,

20:47.110 --> 20:49.477
she goes,
and she meets this guy in Greensburg,

20:49.562 --> 20:50.945
- this J.R. Taylor.
- Okay.

20:51.047 --> 20:52.863
And she married him within the day,

20:52.949 --> 20:54.832
shocked friends and family.

20:54.951 --> 20:55.983
What do you... wait... wait a minute.

20:56.069 --> 20:57.852
She got married the same
day she met the guy?

20:57.937 --> 20:59.820
- Same day she met him.
- Wow.

20:59.956 --> 21:01.055
What happened?

21:01.190 --> 21:04.825
Just a couple days later,
he wrote four suicide notes.

21:04.927 --> 21:06.127
And in those suicide notes,

21:06.262 --> 21:09.947
he expressed how sorry he
was that he had no money

21:10.066 --> 21:12.583
and he could not support his new bride.

21:12.702 --> 21:15.136
Only possession he had of
value was a gold piece,

21:15.221 --> 21:17.304
and he wrote in the suicide letter

21:17.390 --> 21:18.856
to leave it to Mattie,

21:18.975 --> 21:21.642
a woman that he only knew for a few days.

21:21.728 --> 21:23.594
Then, after he wrote those notes,

21:23.713 --> 21:25.913
he went and took a lethal dose of morphine

21:26.015 --> 21:28.649
and was found the next morning.

21:28.785 --> 21:30.584
"From the Alter to the Grave."

21:30.670 --> 21:32.920
That says it all right there, huh?

21:34.090 --> 21:35.756
The younger lady,

21:35.858 --> 21:38.392
she was all about money,
money, money, money.

21:39.495 --> 21:43.230
Her parents may have had some money.

21:43.316 --> 21:45.883
Um, I'm seeing, like, gold.

21:45.968 --> 21:49.904
I would put her not much further than 1918.

21:50.006 --> 21:54.008
She might have had two
relationships with two men,

21:54.110 --> 21:57.545
uh, that didn't end well.

21:57.630 --> 22:00.347
She was, like, a control freak.

22:00.433 --> 22:02.416
She was kind of demented.

22:17.242 --> 22:18.508
Another thing caught my attention.

22:18.610 --> 22:19.876
Back in 1970,

22:19.978 --> 22:22.062
just down the block from
Jimmy and Melissa's house,

22:22.180 --> 22:23.813
a guy broke in and murdered a woman

22:23.949 --> 22:26.616
right in front of her 6-year-old kid.

22:26.718 --> 22:28.318
I'm heading over to meet
with the county sheriff,

22:28.420 --> 22:29.953
who said it was one of
the most brutal crimes

22:30.038 --> 22:31.821
in the city's history.

22:36.161 --> 22:38.962
So, Sheriff Held, this homicide
I asked you to look into for me,

22:39.064 --> 22:40.663
it was pretty brutal.

22:40.766 --> 22:42.966
Yeah, It was one of the most
notorious in Delmont's history.

22:43.101 --> 22:43.933
So, what were you able to find out

22:44.036 --> 22:45.535
about the victim in this case?

22:45.637 --> 22:46.870
Her name's Harriet Thomas.

22:46.955 --> 22:49.539
She was a 52-year-old white female.

22:49.641 --> 22:51.608
She lived across the
street and one house over

22:51.743 --> 22:53.576
from, your client's property.

22:53.662 --> 22:55.445
All right, so,
what do we know about our perp in this case?

22:55.530 --> 22:56.646
His name is Johnny Fostar.

22:56.782 --> 22:58.882
He was 25 years old at
the time of the murder.

22:58.967 --> 23:00.183
He lived across the street

23:00.268 --> 23:01.935
but one house in the opposite direction

23:02.020 --> 23:03.319
from the victim.

23:03.422 --> 23:06.356
And we have a picture of him too.

23:06.441 --> 23:08.691
Got into trouble at a very young age.

23:08.777 --> 23:10.727
- First arrest was at 12.
- Okay.

23:10.796 --> 23:13.296
And it started out just petty crimes...
you know, theft,

23:13.382 --> 23:15.465
breaking into houses, and stealing.

23:15.550 --> 23:17.734
He was once investigated for

23:17.869 --> 23:18.785
breaking into a neighbor's home

23:18.904 --> 23:20.620
and observing her while she slept

23:20.739 --> 23:22.705
and actually touched her and woke her up.

23:22.791 --> 23:24.023
- He's a creeper?
- Yes.

23:24.109 --> 23:24.974
- Peeping Tom maybe.
- Right.

23:25.060 --> 23:27.043
He could be referred to as.

23:29.781 --> 23:32.048
The pervy guy, I
would kind of put him,

23:32.150 --> 23:37.620
like, in the '70s, like
1970s or '60s maybe.

23:37.706 --> 23:39.222
I'm trying to get a read on the creepy guy

23:39.324 --> 23:41.224
who watches the living here.

23:41.326 --> 23:43.410
He doesn't want me to see anything,

23:43.528 --> 23:46.629
but I'm getting quick glimpses
of what he was like in life.

23:46.731 --> 23:48.565
He's weird.

23:48.667 --> 23:50.600
Like, stalker.

23:54.005 --> 23:58.108
He was some kind of sexual offender.

23:58.210 --> 24:00.126
All right, so how's this homicide go down?

24:00.245 --> 24:02.045
On February 28th, 1970,

24:02.130 --> 24:04.264
he broke into Harriet Thomas' house.

24:04.382 --> 24:05.498
Apparently, he was mixing alcohol

24:05.617 --> 24:07.684
with 15 Benzodiazepine pills.

24:07.769 --> 24:09.702
- Very strong narcotics.
- Yes.

24:09.821 --> 24:11.788
There's a struggle with her,

24:11.873 --> 24:13.723
and he stabs her 27 times
with a screwdriver

24:13.859 --> 24:15.308
in front of her 6-year-old son.

24:15.393 --> 24:17.827
And I have the coroner's report here.

24:19.231 --> 24:20.730
Okay.

24:20.816 --> 24:23.399
So she's stabbed in the
chest with a screwdriver.

24:23.485 --> 24:25.568
This guy really did a job on her.

24:25.654 --> 24:27.103
He was actually convicted in this courtroom

24:27.205 --> 24:29.205
right here on December 7th, 1970.

24:29.291 --> 24:31.691
So now, what did he get convicted of?

24:31.810 --> 24:33.009
He got convicted of murder

24:33.145 --> 24:34.844
and got sentenced to life
in prison without parole.

24:34.980 --> 24:37.747
And we have a, uh... we have a photo here

24:37.833 --> 24:39.682
that is a Department of Corrections photo.

24:39.768 --> 24:40.884
Okay, so now, this guy's 25

24:41.019 --> 24:42.502
at the time of the homicide in '70.

24:42.587 --> 24:44.387
Plausibly,
he could still be alive in jail, right?

24:44.473 --> 24:46.322
Oh, no. He died in 2003 of lung cancer

24:46.458 --> 24:47.574
at the age of 57.

24:47.659 --> 24:49.809
Good. He deserved it.

24:50.996 --> 24:54.397
Something about fif... The number 15

24:54.499 --> 24:56.666
has something to do with this male.

24:56.751 --> 25:00.904
I do see blood on his hands
when he's talking about this.

25:03.942 --> 25:06.409
He's older. He's probably in his 50s.

25:06.511 --> 25:09.062
He's got, like, that kind of hairstyle.

25:09.181 --> 25:11.781
It's longer, you know, swept over.

25:11.883 --> 25:14.651
He occasionally has a mustache.

25:14.753 --> 25:16.920
You would never think he was a weirdo.

25:17.022 --> 25:21.658
Like, he looks like a nice,
little middle-aged,

25:21.760 --> 25:24.127
you know, family man or something.

25:29.501 --> 25:32.202
I saw several dead people during my walk.

25:32.304 --> 25:34.737
But the angry woman
tormenting a living child

25:34.839 --> 25:36.506
had me the most concerned.

25:36.641 --> 25:38.041
She's young.

25:38.143 --> 25:39.275
Pretty thin.

25:39.411 --> 25:42.145
She had dark hair.

25:42.247 --> 25:48.218
There was a kid in the bed.

25:48.320 --> 25:53.790
And this lady,
she was smothering this child.

25:56.962 --> 25:59.646
Is this what you saw?

25:59.731 --> 26:01.614
Yes. That's what I saw.

26:21.429 --> 26:24.196
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

26:24.282 --> 26:25.481
we're ready to reveal our findings

26:25.600 --> 26:29.568
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

26:29.670 --> 26:32.738
Now, Amy, when you talked to
Jimmy and Melissa here, um,

26:32.840 --> 26:34.373
it doesn't take but a couple of seconds

26:34.508 --> 26:37.109
to realize how much they love their kids.

26:37.211 --> 26:39.311
I have a photo here of the family.

26:39.413 --> 26:41.513
This is their oldest daughter,
Samone, who's 9.

26:41.599 --> 26:43.449
This is Mason, who's 7.

26:43.584 --> 26:45.918
And this is Cyrus, who is now what, 20...

26:46.003 --> 26:47.253
- 22 months.
- 22 months.

26:47.338 --> 26:49.238
Now, they're the reason we're here.

26:49.323 --> 26:51.941
Melissa thinks they're in danger.

26:52.059 --> 26:54.260
Even though that house
has been in Jimmy's family

26:54.345 --> 26:56.895
for three generations,
if we can't help them,

26:56.998 --> 26:58.998
he's ready to pack up and leave.

26:59.100 --> 27:00.866
So now that Amy knows a
little bit about your family

27:00.952 --> 27:01.917
and what's going on here,

27:02.036 --> 27:06.071
I'm gonna ask her to describe her walk.

27:06.157 --> 27:08.240
When I got here,

27:08.342 --> 27:12.745
there were several dead
people roaming about.

27:12.847 --> 27:15.648
But first I want to discuss

27:15.750 --> 27:18.017
the male that's in the living room area.

27:18.119 --> 27:19.168
Okay.

27:19.253 --> 27:24.256
And, um,
he seemed to be kind of a sexual deviant.

27:24.358 --> 27:27.443
I actually saw him going through ladies'
underwear.

27:27.561 --> 27:30.763
He likes to watch people get undressed.

27:30.865 --> 27:34.066
He also likes to caress or touch people.

27:34.201 --> 27:35.284
That doesn't surprise me,

27:35.403 --> 27:36.902
'cause I always feel
like I'm being watched,

27:36.988 --> 27:39.021
and it's weird because when I'm
getting a shower or anything,

27:39.106 --> 27:40.105
it's like I shut the door,
and then I still feel like

27:40.191 --> 27:41.440
there's a camera or something on me.

27:41.525 --> 27:44.877
You know what I mean?
Like, I'm not alone in there.

27:44.962 --> 27:48.130
I did actually see him in
the upstairs master bedroom,

27:48.215 --> 27:50.683
and he was touching a male.

27:50.768 --> 27:52.117
What I saw was

27:52.186 --> 27:55.421
this male feeling something
strange happening,

27:55.506 --> 27:57.356
and kind of being like,

27:57.458 --> 27:59.141
you know, "I'm sick and tired of this.

27:59.226 --> 28:00.893
It's got to stop."

28:00.978 --> 28:02.928
It's funny you mentioned upstairs because,
I mean,

28:03.014 --> 28:05.431
things are so bad in the house
that Melissa and the kids

28:05.566 --> 28:07.099
sleep down here in the living room.

28:07.201 --> 28:07.866
Okay.

28:07.952 --> 28:09.018
Do me a favor.

28:09.136 --> 28:11.603
Tell Amy about the incident with the bed.

28:11.706 --> 28:13.489
Yeah.

28:13.607 --> 28:16.375
I felt like I was picked up,

28:16.477 --> 28:18.711
picked up to the ceiling and dropped.

28:18.813 --> 28:20.012
And he's not someone who scares easily.

28:20.097 --> 28:21.930
When he came out, he was white as a ghost,

28:22.016 --> 28:23.432
and I knew something was wrong.

28:23.551 --> 28:26.485
I had no clue.

28:26.570 --> 28:28.887
Now,
I did come across a perv in my research,

28:29.023 --> 28:30.556
but I need to know a little
bit more about this guy

28:30.691 --> 28:32.224
if you've got anything.

28:32.326 --> 28:36.061
I got that he was from the '60s or '70s.

28:36.197 --> 28:39.715
The number 15 was important.

28:39.800 --> 28:42.234
He was talking about women in his life

28:42.336 --> 28:44.887
and how that never went well.

28:45.005 --> 28:47.673
Obviously, he had sexual problems.

28:47.808 --> 28:50.242
So then I saw him looking
in a mirror in a bathroom,

28:50.344 --> 28:51.860
and he had his hands up,

28:51.946 --> 28:54.930
and there was blood all over his hands.

28:56.217 --> 28:57.349
Well, a lot of things you're saying

28:57.451 --> 29:00.152
reminds me of a guy named Johnny Fostar.

29:00.254 --> 29:02.287
He grew up a couple doors down from here.

29:02.373 --> 29:04.456
I got a photo of him here.

29:04.542 --> 29:06.041
Now, this guy was a neighborhood criminal.

29:06.127 --> 29:07.309
- Oh.
- He stole a lot from everybody.

29:07.428 --> 29:08.627
He was a thief.

29:08.729 --> 29:11.647
Now, most of these crimes
took place during the '60s.

29:11.766 --> 29:15.434
Now, in 1968,
he got caught breaking into a woman's house

29:15.519 --> 29:16.919
and watching her sleep,

29:17.037 --> 29:18.937
and she woke up when he touched her.

29:19.039 --> 29:19.605
Oh, my goodness.

29:19.707 --> 29:20.973
Oh, Lord.

29:21.058 --> 29:22.841
- You mentioned about blood on his hands...
- Uh-huh.

29:22.977 --> 29:24.893
- ...and the number 15.
- Uh-huh.

29:25.012 --> 29:28.147
On the night of February 28th, 1970,

29:28.232 --> 29:30.482
uh, Johnny here wound up taking 15 pills,

29:30.618 --> 29:32.434
- very strong narcotics...
- Oh.

29:32.520 --> 29:33.685
Mixed with booze,

29:33.788 --> 29:35.521
and he breaks into a woman's house

29:35.623 --> 29:36.789
right across the street from you

29:36.874 --> 29:37.956
by the name of Harriet Thomas.

29:38.058 --> 29:41.326
She was a 52-year-old female.

29:42.363 --> 29:45.431
Harriet gets attacked by Johnny.

29:45.533 --> 29:46.849
He stabs her 27 times in the chest

29:46.967 --> 29:48.267
- with a screwdriver...
- Oh, my God.

29:48.369 --> 29:51.487
- Oh, my God.
- ...In front of her 6-year-old kid.

29:51.605 --> 29:53.806
- Whoa.
- Oh, my God.

29:53.908 --> 29:56.175
I actually got the coroner's report.

29:56.277 --> 29:58.110
Stab wound of chest with a screwdriver.

29:58.212 --> 30:00.412
Oh, my goodness.

30:00.514 --> 30:02.748
My God.

30:02.833 --> 30:05.651
He was convicted and
sentenced to life in prison.

30:05.753 --> 30:08.270
He wound up dying in
prison at the age of 57.

30:08.389 --> 30:12.925
- I got a photo of him just before he died.
- Oh, hmm.

30:13.027 --> 30:14.910
Now, is it possible this
could be the guy you saw?

30:14.995 --> 30:17.212
Yeah. I think that's the guy.

30:21.418 --> 30:22.634
I wish I could just meet him,

30:22.736 --> 30:25.737
and I wish I could just
do something [bleep]

30:27.675 --> 30:29.575
Could this be who lifted Jimmy?

30:29.677 --> 30:32.411
Oh, I don't think so.

30:32.546 --> 30:34.346
There's someone worse.

30:38.602 --> 30:40.936
I met two women in here.

30:41.055 --> 30:43.522
Um, but the first one I'm going to discuss

30:43.657 --> 30:45.691
is the older woman.

30:45.793 --> 30:50.195
She doesn't really interact
with living people.

30:50.297 --> 30:52.965
Um, I know that she got sick here.

30:53.050 --> 30:54.867
She felt ill here.

30:54.969 --> 30:58.170
I got her sickness a lot upstairs...

30:58.272 --> 31:00.372
Dizziness, pain.

31:00.474 --> 31:03.659
I got that there was some mental confusion

31:03.744 --> 31:06.512
with her, uh, death,

31:06.614 --> 31:08.146
and then the worst part,

31:08.232 --> 31:10.182
there was an impact to her head.

31:13.821 --> 31:16.705
You okay, Jimmy?

31:16.824 --> 31:18.240
What?

31:18.325 --> 31:21.760
This is a little bit of
a delicate situation.

31:21.846 --> 31:25.597
Um,
you mentioned the woman you saw was sick.

31:25.699 --> 31:27.032
Back in the 1980s, Jimmy's
grandmother Helen

31:27.167 --> 31:29.668
was diagnosed with bone cancer.

31:29.753 --> 31:30.953
Oh.

31:31.071 --> 31:32.905
Um, she suffered a great deal.

31:32.990 --> 31:33.939
It might've been a problem
with the medication.

31:34.041 --> 31:36.608
- She was disoriented.
- Yes. Okay.

31:36.694 --> 31:37.826
So, um...

31:40.231 --> 31:41.613
back in 1989,

31:41.699 --> 31:43.232
Jimmy's grandmother wound
up committing suicide

31:43.350 --> 31:45.350
by shooting herself in the head upstairs.

31:52.126 --> 31:55.360
She was just a good woman, you know?

31:55.496 --> 31:59.731
She was, like, a... like,
a saint, you know?

32:00.834 --> 32:03.986
I actually have a picture
of your grandmother.

32:04.071 --> 32:07.306
This is not too long before she passed.

32:07.391 --> 32:09.374
They didn't tell me she was sick.

32:09.460 --> 32:10.759
Wow.

32:12.546 --> 32:14.446
The important thing is for Jimmy to know,

32:14.531 --> 32:15.614
is his grandmother here?

32:15.699 --> 32:17.165
I...Yeah.

32:19.286 --> 32:20.335
The good news is

32:20.454 --> 32:22.821
I think she's here watching over you guys.

32:22.907 --> 32:25.057
She was really helpful as far as...

32:25.159 --> 32:25.958
Oh, okay.

32:26.043 --> 32:27.943
You know, telling me bad things

32:28.028 --> 32:29.628
that other dead people
were doing, you know?

32:29.763 --> 32:30.996
Okay.

32:32.399 --> 32:34.032
I mean, I was hoping this wasn't the case,

32:34.134 --> 32:35.667
that your grandmother wasn't here,

32:35.753 --> 32:39.304
but it sounds like at
least she's trying to help.

32:39.406 --> 32:40.806
She's protecting.

32:40.908 --> 32:42.541
Yeah.

32:44.678 --> 32:45.928
There's one other thing I want to bring up,

32:46.046 --> 32:47.479
and this involves one of the kids.

32:47.581 --> 32:48.780
It's Mason, who's 7, right?

32:48.882 --> 32:50.315
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

32:50.417 --> 32:51.566
You know what, Jimmy?
You explain it to her better.

32:51.652 --> 32:53.885
It's your son, about what he sees in...

32:53.988 --> 32:56.521
He says he sees blood on the floor

32:56.607 --> 32:59.324
in the same room that my grandmother died.

32:59.410 --> 33:00.325
Okay.

33:00.411 --> 33:03.895
And he's pretty dead set on it.

33:03.981 --> 33:07.432
Well, you do have a dead person here

33:07.534 --> 33:13.188
who would prefer the children
have negative experiences.

33:13.273 --> 33:14.773
That's what I thought.

33:19.663 --> 33:24.049
So the person that I think
is the biggest threat here

33:24.151 --> 33:27.686
is this younger dead woman.

33:27.788 --> 33:32.124
She seems to be from a very long time ago.

33:32.226 --> 33:35.360
I put her at about 25 years of age.

33:35.462 --> 33:37.629
I think her parents had some money

33:37.715 --> 33:40.432
because her fixation in life

33:40.567 --> 33:44.269
was very much focused on money and image.

33:44.355 --> 33:48.573
And she had two relationships
with two different men

33:48.659 --> 33:50.993
that did not end well.

33:52.329 --> 33:53.912
I got one woman in the
research that came up

33:54.014 --> 33:56.281
that actually only lived a
couple doors down from here.

33:56.383 --> 33:58.183
This woman named Mattie Waugaman

33:58.318 --> 34:00.018
lived down here in the late 1800s.

34:00.120 --> 34:01.253
Her parents owned a tavern in town

34:01.338 --> 34:03.789
and were part of Delmont's high society.

34:03.891 --> 34:06.074
Now, you mentioned the woman
you saw is obsessed with money.

34:06.193 --> 34:07.109
Uh, this woman, Mattie,

34:07.194 --> 34:10.495
was caught up in a pretty big scandal.

34:10.581 --> 34:12.130
She was accused of stealing things

34:12.216 --> 34:13.331
from wealthy people's homes,

34:13.434 --> 34:15.417
but she was never charged.

34:15.536 --> 34:16.534
Interesting.

34:16.670 --> 34:17.936
But what really got my attention

34:18.072 --> 34:20.772
was what you said about the
bad relationships with men.

34:20.873 --> 34:22.056
- Um...
- Mm-hmm.

34:22.176 --> 34:26.078
This woman had disastrous
relationships with two men.

34:26.179 --> 34:27.779
- Hmm.
- 1873, she had a kid out of wedlock,

34:27.880 --> 34:31.583
- which is pretty unheard of back then.
- Back then, yeah, of course.

34:31.668 --> 34:33.819
So when she had the baby,
it was a huge scandal.

34:33.920 --> 34:35.070
About 11 years later,

34:35.155 --> 34:37.456
she wound up having a second
disastrous relationship

34:37.541 --> 34:40.175
with a man, a guy named J.R. Taylor.

34:40.293 --> 34:42.226
She met him and married him the same day.

34:42.312 --> 34:43.695
- Oh.
- Oh, nice.

34:43.781 --> 34:46.864
Three days later,
this guy J.R. Taylor committed suicide

34:47.000 --> 34:50.168
with an overdose of morphine.

34:50.270 --> 34:52.437
- Wow.
- I actually have an article here from it.

34:55.275 --> 34:56.341
Now, in the suicide letter,

34:56.443 --> 34:58.076
he basically said that he
didn't have enough money

34:58.178 --> 34:59.277
to support his new wife,

34:59.379 --> 35:01.730
and he left her the only
thing he had of value,

35:01.849 --> 35:03.048
the gold piece.

35:03.150 --> 35:04.966
So you got to wonder what
kind of a woman that was

35:05.085 --> 35:07.119
that had this guy so wrapped up in one day.

35:07.204 --> 35:08.253
Mm.

35:08.338 --> 35:10.455
Now, when Mattie died in 1905,

35:10.557 --> 35:12.724
she was buried in the
cemetery right up the street.

35:12.810 --> 35:14.493
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

35:14.578 --> 35:18.080
Now, does this sound like
possibly who you ran into?

35:18.198 --> 35:19.865
Sounds about right.

35:22.953 --> 35:27.506
I feel, obviously,
that she has some mental issues.

35:27.591 --> 35:33.678
The biggest problem was that
she really despises children.

35:37.584 --> 35:39.651
She doesn't even see them as human.

35:40.871 --> 35:43.321
When I saw her upstairs,

35:43.423 --> 35:46.892
she's like this monstrous,
like, being up there.

35:46.977 --> 35:50.695
And there's this energy
that's just horrendous.

35:50.831 --> 35:56.401
She knows exactly what
to do to torture someone.

35:56.503 --> 35:58.236
I see her sleeping in the bed,

35:58.338 --> 36:01.540
like, clutched, being clutched.

36:03.844 --> 36:07.078
Cold, icy hands.

36:07.164 --> 36:09.247
Really bad.

36:09.349 --> 36:12.350
I saw her racing back and
forth through that door

36:12.486 --> 36:14.352
as, like, a silhouetted figure

36:14.438 --> 36:16.888
between the two children's bedrooms.

36:18.192 --> 36:21.193
Now you know why the kids sleep downstairs.

36:21.278 --> 36:23.879
My daughter woke up screaming

36:23.997 --> 36:25.230
that somebody was in her room

36:25.315 --> 36:26.665
opening and slamming her drawers.

36:26.767 --> 36:28.633
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean, she was terrified.

36:28.735 --> 36:31.970
Mason had an incident where he saw
white mist coming up the stairs.

36:32.072 --> 36:34.789
Yeah. He said it was a white mist.

36:34.875 --> 36:36.374
It looked like a human shape.

36:36.460 --> 36:37.826
Okay.

36:37.945 --> 36:39.828
And they wake up with bruises.

36:39.947 --> 36:41.079
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, my God.

36:41.165 --> 36:42.480
- And scratches.
- Yeah.

36:42.566 --> 36:44.082
Wow.

36:45.986 --> 36:46.735
Now, could this be this...

36:46.854 --> 36:49.704
- this woman?
- Yeah. Yeah.

36:54.645 --> 36:58.029
To think that something is...
is attacking my kids,

36:58.131 --> 37:00.715
that's enraging.

37:00.834 --> 37:06.071
Yeah, kids can't grow up like this.

37:06.156 --> 37:08.139
So I had a sketch done of something

37:08.225 --> 37:12.410
that she would like to do, um, to your son.

37:21.788 --> 37:22.754
As a parent, I don't even want to

37:22.839 --> 37:24.322
put this down in front of you,

37:24.458 --> 37:25.824
but, you know...

37:28.028 --> 37:29.110
Oh, my God.

37:31.882 --> 37:33.431
She's lucky I can't see her.

37:35.118 --> 37:36.568
I carry a gun on me.

37:39.089 --> 37:41.106
She's lucky she's not living.

37:56.581 --> 37:58.348
I had a sketch done of something

37:58.450 --> 38:02.785
that she would like to do, um, to your son.

38:11.997 --> 38:12.996
As a parent, I don't even want to

38:13.081 --> 38:14.497
put this down in front of you,

38:14.633 --> 38:16.382
but, you know...

38:18.703 --> 38:19.786
Oh, my God.

38:24.175 --> 38:25.675
She's lucky I can't see her.

38:27.178 --> 38:28.678
I carry a gun on me.

38:31.199 --> 38:33.216
She's lucky she's not living.

38:35.153 --> 38:36.319
So she's trying to smother him?

38:36.404 --> 38:37.854
Mm-hmm.

38:37.956 --> 38:40.723
Mason breathes real heavy.

38:40.825 --> 38:43.660
You can hear him...

38:43.745 --> 38:45.795
It sounds like he's
having problems breathing.

38:45.897 --> 38:47.981
Okay.

38:48.099 --> 38:51.701
She does a weird thing
with her hands and fingers

38:51.770 --> 38:56.105
over his mouth, so that does worry me.

38:56.191 --> 38:58.308
This wicked, little [bleep] needs to go.

38:59.744 --> 39:00.843
What's her endgame?

39:00.979 --> 39:04.747
As far as your son is concerned,

39:04.883 --> 39:07.383
like, she would like to kill him.

39:10.422 --> 39:12.889
I mean, that's her... her goal.

39:12.974 --> 39:16.075
Is she even capable of doing
that to this kid, God forbid?

39:16.161 --> 39:18.127
I think it's a possibility.

39:18.229 --> 39:20.980
So... so that does worry me.

39:21.066 --> 39:22.165
I'd burn it to the ground

39:22.300 --> 39:24.834
if it meant for my family to be happy.

39:24.970 --> 39:27.337
It's just... I mean,
the house does mean a lot to me,

39:27.472 --> 39:29.255
but it doesn't mean nowhere even close

39:29.341 --> 39:31.391
to what my children and my wife mean to me.

39:31.509 --> 39:32.425
Right.

39:35.647 --> 39:36.980
So guys, it's been a rough night,

39:37.082 --> 39:42.285
and I'm really sorry about that,
especially about your grandma.

39:42.370 --> 39:44.187
Um, but you two are fighters,

39:44.272 --> 39:46.773
and now you know what's
going after your kids.

39:46.858 --> 39:49.926
Now the thing is, how do we get
rid of the bad dead in the house

39:50.028 --> 39:51.394
so you guys can live a normal life

39:51.496 --> 39:54.547
and raise your kids here
in a comfortable manner?

39:54.632 --> 39:56.466
For that answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:58.570 --> 40:03.606
Uh,
the first thing is to find a male medium.

40:04.759 --> 40:09.145
And this person,
on the first day they're here,

40:09.247 --> 40:12.548
is to deal with the male that's here.

40:12.684 --> 40:16.052
So the medium's job here is
to get him out of your house

40:16.154 --> 40:18.121
and to banish him from the house.

40:18.206 --> 40:20.840
And then the second day, actually,

40:20.959 --> 40:22.959
I would like for him, the male medium,

40:23.044 --> 40:24.927
to give you a reading

40:25.030 --> 40:27.263
because there are things

40:27.365 --> 40:31.284
that your grandmother needs to talk about.

40:31.403 --> 40:34.587
Once the reading is finished,
she'll be ready to move on.

40:35.874 --> 40:39.409
Okay. Now, what about the lunatic woman?

40:39.494 --> 40:42.445
Uh, the last thing that you guys do

40:42.547 --> 40:44.881
is to have a Voodoo priestess come.

40:46.084 --> 40:48.968
This is something that terrifies her.

40:49.054 --> 40:51.287
So I think that she feels like

40:51.373 --> 40:54.290
that's going to put her in a place

40:54.426 --> 40:58.027
where she kind of knows she belongs.

40:58.129 --> 41:00.296
She's pretty terrified.

41:00.398 --> 41:01.030
Good.

41:01.132 --> 41:02.648
This little [bleep]...

41:02.734 --> 41:05.168
she could get hit by a bus tomorrow

41:05.303 --> 41:08.071
and I wouldn't care, you know what I mean?

41:08.156 --> 41:09.439
So, Jimmy, it's got to make you feel good

41:09.541 --> 41:11.307
that you can keep the house
that's been in your family

41:11.393 --> 41:12.475
for three generations.

41:12.577 --> 41:15.428
Of course. Yes.

41:15.513 --> 41:17.180
You gonna take Amy's advice?

41:17.282 --> 41:20.483
Absolutely. Absolutely.

41:20.568 --> 41:21.350
She's gone.

41:24.255 --> 41:26.122
I'm really concerned for Melissa and Jimmy,

41:26.224 --> 41:27.857
as the dead terrorizing their family

41:27.959 --> 41:29.992
present a serious danger.

41:30.095 --> 41:32.695
But with the help of a medium
and a Voodoo priestess,

41:32.831 --> 41:33.996
they'll be able to rid their home

41:34.082 --> 41:36.032
of the evil surrounding it
and live a peaceful life.
