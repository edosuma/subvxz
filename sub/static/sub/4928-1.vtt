Keep on crashing on me *

00:59.593 --> 01:03.131
* For some reason *

01:03.131 --> 01:05.533
Terrific.

01:05.533 --> 01:07.368
* But your love
Keeps on coming *

01:07.368 --> 01:09.770
* Like a thunderbolt *

01:14.041 --> 01:19.313
* Well, come here
A little closer *

01:21.749 --> 01:24.218
* 'Cause I want to see you
Baby *

01:30.158 --> 01:33.093
* You got me feeling hella good
So let's just keep on... *

01:33.093 --> 01:34.862
Hey, sexy.
Hi.

01:34.862 --> 01:37.765
I love that dress.
Of course you do, Lorenzo.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.500
You made it.

01:39.500 --> 01:42.670
Hi, sweetie.
Hey, guys.

01:42.670 --> 01:44.738
Oh, there you are.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.207
Lena.
Hi.

01:46.207 --> 01:47.508
You've done it again.

01:47.508 --> 01:48.909
Well, it's all for you, Bradlee.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.378
Gotta mingle.

01:50.378 --> 01:51.679
Oh, the girls are by the pool.

01:51.679 --> 01:54.282
MAN:
Well, well, well,
Lena.

01:54.282 --> 01:57.418
So where's this
sexy boy toy of yours hiding?

01:57.418 --> 01:59.420
I didn't know you were
a football fan, Patrick.

01:59.420 --> 02:00.888
I've never watched a game.

02:00.888 --> 02:03.056
I'm just a big fan
of his old underwear ads.

02:03.056 --> 02:05.259
Well, he's probably
just getting out of the shower.

02:05.259 --> 02:07.361
Let me go hurry his ass up.

02:07.361 --> 02:10.964
Hi.
Hey, babe.

ANNOUNCER:
Start of the fourth quarter,
Owens will throw.

02:13.434 --> 02:14.635
He's got Brown wide open!

02:14.635 --> 02:17.605
You have got to be
kidding me.

02:17.605 --> 02:19.240
Honey,
just lemme finish the game,

02:19.240 --> 02:20.941
I'll take ya to the movies.

02:20.941 --> 02:22.876
Take me to the movies?

02:22.876 --> 02:24.312
Hello!

02:24.312 --> 02:26.514
There's a huge party going on
downstairs.

02:26.514 --> 02:29.016
Remember the catering trucks
and the valet parkers?

02:29.016 --> 02:30.984
Oh, shit, I forgot.

02:30.984 --> 02:34.455
I'll tell you
what you should forget about.

02:35.823 --> 02:36.990
Football.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.427
Because it's forgotten
all about you.

02:39.427 --> 02:41.829
Now, you're going to
put this outfit on

02:41.829 --> 02:43.197
that I bought you...

02:43.197 --> 02:45.733
drag your drunken ass
downstairs...

02:45.733 --> 02:50.571
and mingle with my clients
like a good boy.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.273
Who am I? Elton John?

02:52.273 --> 02:53.807
I ain't wearin' that shit.

02:53.807 --> 02:55.409
Yes, you are.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.110
I'm not your trained monkey,
honey.

02:57.110 --> 02:58.446
No.

02:58.446 --> 03:00.414
You're much more expensive
than that.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.015
But I tell ya what.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.652
If you're not downstairs
in five minutes...

03:04.652 --> 03:07.321
I'm gonna throw you
outta my bed...

03:07.321 --> 03:09.357
outta my house...

03:09.357 --> 03:10.958
and outta my life.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.994
Then you're gonna have to pay
for your own bananas.

03:13.994 --> 03:16.163
I'm just so mad at you

03:16.163 --> 03:18.966
'cause you're not
wearin' my gift.

03:18.966 --> 03:21.001
Gift?

03:21.001 --> 03:22.470
What gift?

03:22.470 --> 03:24.538
It's like a I-love-you gift.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.740
I left it in the closet for you.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.609
Really?

03:28.609 --> 03:30.244
Paul, I'm so excited.

03:30.244 --> 03:32.145
I can't believe you did this.

03:32.145 --> 03:33.347
Where'd you put it?

03:33.347 --> 03:36.417
In the back, on the right.

03:36.417 --> 03:38.286
Paul? Paul, what are you doing?

03:38.286 --> 03:40.721
I think we need
some alone time, honey,

03:40.721 --> 03:43.591
so I'm gonna go take a cruise
in your Bentley.

03:43.591 --> 03:47.160
Don't you dare take my car,
you drunken bastard!

03:47.160 --> 03:48.396
I own you!

03:48.396 --> 03:50.531
I love you.

Lena?
Patrick?

04:14.888 --> 04:16.824
Lena?
Patrick.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.392
What happened to you?

04:19.392 --> 04:21.028
He locked me in the closet

04:21.028 --> 04:22.330
and left me to die.

04:22.330 --> 04:25.065
Oh, my God, he is deranged!

04:25.065 --> 04:26.967
He thinks he can mess with me.

Well, well, well.
I'll be damned.

04:47.220 --> 04:49.122
If it isn't Paul Crewe.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.492
So, what did I do wrong?
Was I driving poorly?

04:51.492 --> 04:52.726
Nope. Nope.

04:52.726 --> 04:54.227
This car was reported stolen.

04:54.227 --> 04:55.496
No, no, no.

04:55.496 --> 04:57.931
It's actually
my girlfriend's car.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.500
Shit happens.

04:59.500 --> 05:00.834
Shit does happen.

to your ears.

I gotta ask you somethin'.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.041
Does he get XM Radio with those?

05:08.041 --> 05:10.744
Actually, they get
a couple of channels.

though.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.952
Santa Claus.
What's he like?

05:18.952 --> 05:20.287
( Paul laughing )

05:20.287 --> 05:22.923
Boy, I hate to arrest
a public figure like yourself,

05:22.923 --> 05:25.693
but, hell, I don't think you got
too many endorsement deals

05:25.693 --> 05:27.761
to worry about, now do ya?

05:27.761 --> 05:29.196

a lotta money

you threw,

05:39.773 --> 05:41.742
'cause that was
the most pathetic thing

05:41.742 --> 05:42.743
I ever saw.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.612
Now, step outta
the vehicle, Mr. Crewe.

05:44.612 --> 05:46.480
Don't you think
I should pull the car over more?

05:46.480 --> 05:48.582
I could get sideswiped.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.418
You're slurrin' your words
a bit there, Paul.

tonight?

What you are watching
is live footage

06:40.100 --> 06:42.235
of a vehicle,
apparently stolen,

06:42.235 --> 06:43.871
being pursued by police.

06:43.871 --> 06:45.506
We're receiving word now

06:45.506 --> 06:46.907
that the driver
of that vehicle

06:46.907 --> 06:48.942
is former
Pittsburgh football star

06:48.942 --> 06:49.943
Paul Crewe.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.879
Crewe, you might remember,

06:51.879 --> 06:53.781
was the only man
ever to be indicted

06:53.781 --> 06:55.382
on federal
racketeering charges...

06:55.382 --> 06:56.684
for shaving points

football game,

never fully proven.

Yeah!

07:11.164 --> 07:13.567
Do not get
one more scratch on my car

07:13.567 --> 07:15.569
or I will slit your throat.

07:17.705 --> 07:19.607
See, that's our problem,
sweetie.

07:19.607 --> 07:22.476
You care about this car
more than you do us.

07:22.476 --> 07:23.711
And how'd you even know

07:23.711 --> 07:25.178
there was a scratch
on this baby?

07:25.178 --> 07:29.182
Because I am watching you on TV,
as is the whole country.

07:29.182 --> 07:31.585
Once again,
you are proving to everyone

07:31.585 --> 07:34.287
what a worthless
piece of shit you are.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.889
Wow.

Crewe's five-year federal
probation for point shaving

08:19.066 --> 08:20.968
has been
severely violated tonight.

once-great football star

son of a bitch, Crewe.

09:31.739 --> 09:33.206
Is that right?

09:33.206 --> 09:34.642
That's right.

09:34.642 --> 09:36.176
See, the warden
loves his football.

09:36.176 --> 09:38.411
Fact, he was on
the winnin' side

09:38.411 --> 09:39.780
of your little thing.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.615
Well, tell him
congratulations.

from here.

09:54.762 --> 09:56.764
Yeah.
Come on.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.298
Warden wants to see you.

are locked up in here.

Ah, no inmates
from my playing days.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.234
Couple of guards,
though.

10:35.535 --> 10:37.805
a fine
prison guard league down here.

10:41.775 --> 10:45.045
Now, the warden...

10:45.045 --> 10:47.280
he's gonna ask you to help out.

asks you...

gonna say?

Yes?

11:05.232 --> 11:07.334

You're gonna
tell him "no."

11:16.276 --> 11:17.577
Ya got it?

11:17.577 --> 11:19.146
You're gonna tell the warden

11:19.146 --> 11:22.883
that you want nothin' to do
with his football fantasies.

11:22.883 --> 11:27.087

don't run this prison.

( groans )

11:36.764 --> 11:38.631
( moaning )

11:38.631 --> 11:39.900
Okay.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.501
I feel ya, dog.

11:41.501 --> 11:43.536
I feel ya.

11:43.536 --> 11:44.738
( knocking )

11:44.738 --> 11:47.407
Paul "Wrecking" Crewe.

11:47.407 --> 11:50.143
I don't get to say this
to my new guests very often,

11:50.143 --> 11:51.678
but it's an honor
to have you here

11:51.678 --> 11:52.946
at this institution.

11:52.946 --> 11:55.548
It's an honor to be
locked up here, sir.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.617
( chuckles )

11:57.617 --> 12:00.653
Oh, well, this is
Errol Dandridge.

12:00.653 --> 12:03.123
Colonel Sanders been
eatin' his own chicken.

12:03.123 --> 12:06.059
HAZEN:
He's my political advisor.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.294
See, I've been approached

12:07.294 --> 12:09.096
by several very
influential people

12:09.096 --> 12:10.363
wonderin' if I'd be
interested

12:10.363 --> 12:11.799
in standin'
for governor.

12:11.799 --> 12:14.067
They see
the way I run this prison,

12:14.067 --> 12:17.304
think maybe I should
run this state.

12:17.304 --> 12:20.908
Only with less
sodomy, right?

12:23.676 --> 12:25.212
( chuckles )

12:25.212 --> 12:27.280
Hopefully none.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.949
Sorry.

12:30.617 --> 12:32.953
Now, there are two things
we take very seriously

12:32.953 --> 12:34.654
here in the state of Texas.

12:34.654 --> 12:35.989
Prison...

12:35.989 --> 12:37.858
and football.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.960
We play
a little of the latter here.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.829
The warden is too modest
to admit

12:41.829 --> 12:44.597
that his team is rather good.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.233
But not good enough.

12:46.233 --> 12:49.702
Five years since
our last championship.

12:49.702 --> 12:51.571
Five years.

12:51.571 --> 12:54.541
Now, I've worked real hard,
pulled strings,

12:54.541 --> 12:57.344
called in quite a few favors
to get you here, Paul.

12:57.344 --> 13:00.647
Now, why would you
go and do that?

13:00.647 --> 13:01.982
Because I am convinced

13:01.982 --> 13:04.317
that you can get us
back on track.

13:05.953 --> 13:07.821
I haven't
played football

13:07.821 --> 13:09.022
in I don't know
how long.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.924
I don't really want to.

13:10.924 --> 13:12.759
You wouldn't be
playin', Paul.

13:12.759 --> 13:14.061
Just consultin'.

13:14.061 --> 13:15.929
Anyone who was once
the Most Valuable Player

13:15.929 --> 13:17.397
of the National
Football League

13:17.397 --> 13:20.067
must have a great deal
of expertise to offer.

13:20.067 --> 13:23.971
Captain, what would you say
to Mr. Crewe lookin' in,

13:23.971 --> 13:26.639
givin' us the benefit
of his experience?

13:26.639 --> 13:28.808
Oh, I think
that's a real good idea, warden.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.878
We can use
all the help we can get.

13:30.878 --> 13:34.414
Well, then,
it's all settled.

13:34.414 --> 13:35.849
What you say, Paul?

13:35.849 --> 13:37.851
I appreciate the offer,

13:37.851 --> 13:40.253
but I'm gonna
have to pass.

13:43.991 --> 13:47.127
Now, I can assure you

13:47.127 --> 13:49.629
that your time here
will be a whole lot easier

13:49.629 --> 13:51.531
if you just participate.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.502
I just wanna do my time
and go home.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.170
Nothin' else.

14:00.207 --> 14:02.809
If you'll excuse us, Mr. Crewe.

14:02.809 --> 14:05.946
Captain Knauer,
you can stay.

14:09.049 --> 14:12.052
Sit down!

14:12.052 --> 14:16.924
I used to love
your underwear commercials.

14:16.924 --> 14:18.158
( Hazen shouting )

14:18.158 --> 14:19.927
Thank you very much.

14:19.927 --> 14:21.661
My ex-husband wore

14:21.661 --> 14:24.731
the same brand
of tighty whities.

14:24.731 --> 14:26.666
He didn't fill 'em out

14:26.666 --> 14:29.736
quite as well as you, though.

14:29.736 --> 14:30.971
Special effects.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.472
Hollywood.

14:32.472 --> 14:33.773
Not all me.

14:33.773 --> 14:36.443
Oh, I doubt that very seriously.

14:36.443 --> 14:38.845
HAZEN:
Well, then,
get him enthusiastic,

14:38.845 --> 14:40.480
damn it!

14:40.480 --> 14:42.015
Come on, get up.

14:42.015 --> 14:43.483
How'd it go
in there?

14:43.483 --> 14:44.684
We all set now?

14:44.684 --> 14:46.954
Oh, yeah, we're real tight.

14:49.689 --> 14:51.158
( loud thump, Paul groans )

14:51.158 --> 14:54.361
( mellow folk guitar
theme playing )

14:58.966 --> 15:02.369
Only the finest for you,
superstar.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.437
( laughs )

15:07.240 --> 15:08.976
I was just playin'.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.349
INMATE:
I ain't gonna
forget you, Crewe.

15:16.349 --> 15:18.485
INMATE 2:
Hey, yo, you owe me money
on that game, punk!

15:18.485 --> 15:20.387
Better watch yourself,
Mr. Football!

15:20.387 --> 15:22.289
Bitch!

15:25.658 --> 15:27.360
( growls )

15:28.996 --> 15:30.998
INMATE 3:
Yeah, you better run,
woman.

15:30.998 --> 15:33.466
( inmates chuckling )

15:33.466 --> 15:34.867
Yo, Football.

15:34.867 --> 15:37.670
Take a seat.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.039
Thanks.

15:39.039 --> 15:40.873
You know, I have
never seen one inmate

15:40.873 --> 15:42.242
just walk in here

15:42.242 --> 15:45.178
and be unanimously hated
by the entire population.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.646
I ain't never seen it.

15:46.646 --> 15:47.880
How'd I get so lucky?

15:47.880 --> 15:50.183
You could have robbed banks.
You could have sold crack.

15:50.183 --> 15:51.651
Stole your
grandmama's pension

15:51.651 --> 15:52.719
and nobody would have cared.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.754
But shavin' points
off a football game?

15:54.754 --> 15:56.323
Man, that's just un-American.

15:56.323 --> 15:58.891
You play football?
Me? Nah.

15:58.891 --> 16:00.127
I suck so bad,

16:00.127 --> 16:02.029
they used to pick me
after the white kids.

16:02.029 --> 16:03.363
Used to be mad too.

16:03.363 --> 16:04.564
It's like, "I can't believe

16:04.564 --> 16:06.033
I picked a nigga
that can't play."

16:06.033 --> 16:07.867
Caretaker.

16:07.867 --> 16:09.202
Paul Crewe.

16:09.202 --> 16:10.603
Whatever
your pleasure,

16:10.603 --> 16:11.938
I can facilitate.

16:11.938 --> 16:13.440
You need weed,
you need meth--

16:13.440 --> 16:14.941
Hey, you need Prozac,
I'm your man.

16:14.941 --> 16:16.143
I know how you white boys

16:16.143 --> 16:17.477
always deal
with that depression.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.179
I mean, me personally,
I don't understand

16:19.179 --> 16:20.847
what you white boys
all depressed about.

16:20.847 --> 16:23.016
Hey, you're white. Smile.

16:23.016 --> 16:24.817
And for a small fee,

16:24.817 --> 16:26.653
I can even get you McDonalds.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.355
Really?
Yeah, that's right. Mickey D's.

16:28.355 --> 16:29.822
My man Cheeseburger Eddy
got the hookup.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.092
PAUL: Cheeseburger Eddy?
CARETAKER: That's right.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.293
We can get
our McFlurry on.

16:33.293 --> 16:35.528
CHEESEBURGER EDDY:
Enjoy it, fat man.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.664
What about the love
of a beautiful woman?

16:37.664 --> 16:39.632
Well, you're gonna have to
lower your standards

16:39.632 --> 16:42.902
on the beautiful part
and on the woman part.

16:42.902 --> 16:44.804
ALL:
Hey.

16:44.804 --> 16:47.174
Let's just stick
with the cheeseburgers.

16:47.174 --> 16:48.508
Oh, they ugly now,

16:48.508 --> 16:50.643
but in eight months,
he gonna look like BeyoncÃƒÂ©.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.245
No, thanks.

16:52.245 --> 16:53.646
Now, here's
the most important part.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.148
You can't
let these guys scare you.

16:55.148 --> 16:56.349
You can't let 'em punk you.

16:56.349 --> 16:57.684
'Cause if you do that,

16:57.684 --> 16:59.552
you gonna end up
bein' somebody's bitch.

16:59.552 --> 17:00.753
Don't want that.

17:00.753 --> 17:04.290
Thanks for the advice.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.930
Hey. Let me take
that tray out for you.

17:10.930 --> 17:12.598
I ain't done eating yet.

17:12.598 --> 17:15.734
Oh, you're not?
I'll give it back to you, then.

17:15.734 --> 17:17.337
You're dead!

17:17.337 --> 17:19.606
( inmates shouting )

17:26.913 --> 17:28.415
Hornet's Nest!

17:35.755 --> 17:38.291
( trays clattering )

17:40.793 --> 17:42.229
Everybody stay down.

17:42.229 --> 17:44.164
Stay quiet!

17:48.135 --> 17:50.670
Come on, Crewe,
get up.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.739
Get up, superstar.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.040
Yes, sir.

17:54.040 --> 17:56.443
You think you can do
anything you want around here,

17:56.443 --> 17:58.678
don't ya? Well,
you are no different

17:58.678 --> 18:02.182
than any other piece of shit
that calls this place home.

18:02.182 --> 18:03.550
Really?

18:03.550 --> 18:06.219
These guys think
you're a dumb redneck too?

18:06.219 --> 18:07.420
( inmates laugh )

18:07.420 --> 18:09.622
Ooh, girl,
that's your new boo.

18:15.962 --> 18:18.898
You better cut that shit out.
It's gettin' old.

18:18.898 --> 18:21.334
That's gonna cost ya.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.236
Lookin' forward to it.

18:26.639 --> 18:29.876
( mellow folk guitar
theme playing )

19:16.356 --> 19:18.791
Wake up,
Sleepin' Beauty.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.929
DUNHAM:
Hey, superdick.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.499
Warden's wonderin'
if your stay in the hotbox

19:26.499 --> 19:28.034
has changed your mind.

19:28.034 --> 19:30.169
How long have I been in here?

19:30.169 --> 19:31.471
One week.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.840
Wanna go for two? Huh?

19:33.840 --> 19:36.376
( chuckles )

19:36.376 --> 19:38.678
( grunting )

19:40.713 --> 19:42.849
PAUL:
How'd you find
these guys, anyways?

19:42.849 --> 19:44.150
HAZEN:
Recruitment, boy.

19:44.150 --> 19:45.918
When college stars
don't get drafted,

19:45.918 --> 19:47.220
they need a place to go.

19:47.220 --> 19:50.757
A job, money, security.

19:50.757 --> 19:54.527
Who drank all
the damn Gatorade?!

19:54.527 --> 19:55.562
Damn it!

19:55.562 --> 19:57.397
And apparently steroids.

19:57.397 --> 19:58.698
Look, seems like
you got

19:58.698 --> 20:00.099
all the talent
you'd want.

20:00.099 --> 20:01.401
So why do you need me?

20:01.401 --> 20:03.102
Well, now, you might find this
hard to believe,

20:03.102 --> 20:05.004
but there's some folks
here in the prison league

20:05.004 --> 20:07.474
don't care for me very much.
You, warden?

20:07.474 --> 20:09.709
Yeah, well, they thought
it might be amusing

20:09.709 --> 20:11.378
to schedule the defending
league champs

20:11.378 --> 20:13.546
as our first game. And me?

20:13.546 --> 20:15.515
Well, I thought
an old pro like yourself

20:15.515 --> 20:18.084
might have some
training camp tricks, drills,

20:18.084 --> 20:19.486
insights to offer up.

20:19.486 --> 20:21.621
Give us the competitive edge.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.089
All right.

20:23.089 --> 20:24.424
Relatively simple.

20:24.424 --> 20:25.892
Ya need a tune-up game.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.093
A tune-up game?

20:27.093 --> 20:28.861
Yeah. In college
we'd start every season

20:28.861 --> 20:31.398
against Appalachian State
or some slack Division II team.

20:31.398 --> 20:32.965
Kick the livin' shit
out of 'em.

20:32.965 --> 20:35.001
Get their confidence up.

20:36.269 --> 20:37.937
Ya know somethin', Paul?

20:37.937 --> 20:39.506
You've just given me
an inspiration.

20:39.506 --> 20:40.740
That's great. What?

20:40.740 --> 20:42.208
You're gonna
assemble a team

20:42.208 --> 20:43.643
to play the first game
against us.

20:43.643 --> 20:47.347
And you, Mr. Crewe,
are gonna be the quarterback.

20:47.347 --> 20:48.948
I don't think so.

20:48.948 --> 20:50.283
Lemme tell you somethin'.

20:50.283 --> 20:51.618
In my prison,

20:51.618 --> 20:53.553
to get along,
you gotta go along.

20:53.553 --> 20:55.822
I just wanna do my three years
and be done.

20:55.822 --> 20:58.991
Three years is before
you assaulted Captain Knauer.

20:58.991 --> 21:00.793
Now, you could
be with us

21:00.793 --> 21:03.530
for a very long time,
Mr. Crewe.

21:05.231 --> 21:07.066
Fine, I'll do it.

21:07.066 --> 21:09.369
Good choice.

21:10.370 --> 21:12.439
But, one condition, though.

21:12.439 --> 21:13.706
Gotta promise me

21:13.706 --> 21:15.442
to keep Captain Knauer
off my back.

21:15.442 --> 21:16.643
HAZEN:
It's a deal.

21:16.643 --> 21:17.944
Now, you got four weeks

21:17.944 --> 21:19.579
to assemble a team
and train 'em.

21:19.579 --> 21:21.213
What, are we gonna have
a half-hour a day

21:21.213 --> 21:22.849
to practice
with a Nerf ball?

21:22.849 --> 21:24.517
Oh, I'll make sure
my boys allow you

21:24.517 --> 21:26.653
sufficient freedom,
within these walls,

21:26.653 --> 21:29.055
to get your team
in shape.

21:30.890 --> 21:32.325
What's this?

21:32.325 --> 21:36.128
"Foot...ball
tree...outs."

21:36.128 --> 21:37.664
What the hell
is a "tree-out"?

21:37.664 --> 21:39.699
"Tryout,"
ya half a meatball.

21:39.699 --> 21:41.468
Hey, what's this football
thing about, man?

21:41.468 --> 21:43.035
Crewe's gettin'
a team together.

21:43.035 --> 21:44.236
To play against who?

21:44.236 --> 21:46.439
The guards.

21:46.439 --> 21:47.640
Now, I don't know about y'all,

21:47.640 --> 21:49.342
but I occasionally
have the impulse

21:49.342 --> 21:52.111
to physically assault one of our
finer correctional officers.

21:52.111 --> 21:53.346
Yeah?

21:53.346 --> 21:54.881
Well, how the hell
we gonna get to do that?

21:54.881 --> 21:58.451
Just show up at the "tree-outs,"
ya big, dumb bitch.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.820
Do the girls
get to play?

22:00.820 --> 22:03.490
We're playin' footballs,
not balls-balls.

22:03.490 --> 22:04.891
CHEESEBURGER EDDY:
This is bullshit.

22:04.891 --> 22:07.460
Just another chance
for the guards to beat on us.

22:07.460 --> 22:08.795
Don't you idiots
get it?

22:08.795 --> 22:10.630
We could get
a free shot at the guards.

22:10.630 --> 22:12.098
This is our turn.

22:12.098 --> 22:13.332
We could beat up on them.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.001
We could kill them.

22:15.001 --> 22:17.870
INMATE 1: Kill 'em.
INMATE 2: Kill 'em.

22:22.875 --> 22:26.879
You know MVP
sold his own teammates out.

22:26.879 --> 22:30.817
What do ya think
he's gonna do to you fools?

22:30.817 --> 22:32.385
And that's the truth.

22:32.385 --> 22:34.987
With some cheese on it.

22:34.987 --> 22:37.356
There ain't no meat loaf
between these buns.

22:37.356 --> 22:39.158
Yo, man,
that's my flier, man!

22:39.158 --> 22:40.760
I worked hard on it! Ya see?

22:40.760 --> 22:43.730
He ran like a little bitch,
right? You saw that, right?

22:43.730 --> 22:46.365
Yo, team needs you.
Team needs you.

22:46.365 --> 22:47.567
You sh--
You come to the tr--

22:47.567 --> 22:48.935
Come to the tree-outs.

22:48.935 --> 22:52.639
( mellow guitar theme playing )

22:54.441 --> 22:56.576
Crappy field,
shit-ass equipment.

22:56.576 --> 22:57.777
Hey, man,
at least we got

22:57.777 --> 23:00.580
some world-class players
over there.

23:03.182 --> 23:05.785
INMATES:
Forty-five.

23:05.785 --> 23:07.554
Forty-six.

23:07.554 --> 23:10.022
Forty-seven.

23:10.022 --> 23:11.357
He might make the team.

23:11.357 --> 23:12.559
Well, if we
gotta cut him,

23:12.559 --> 23:13.960
you're doin' it.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.895
Forty-nine.

23:15.895 --> 23:18.297
Fifty.

23:18.297 --> 23:19.632
All right, man.
Good job, man.

23:19.632 --> 23:21.033
Well, well, well.

23:21.033 --> 23:22.401
You a football player?

23:22.401 --> 23:23.670
Oh, no.

23:23.670 --> 23:25.204
I never played no football,
mister.

23:25.204 --> 23:27.039
So, what happened?
You read the flier,

23:27.039 --> 23:28.641
thought it looked
like some fun?

23:28.641 --> 23:30.076
Oh, I can't read.

23:30.076 --> 23:32.244
Oh, don't worry.
Readin's for rich people.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.013
Just so you know,

23:34.013 --> 23:35.682
we're puttin' together
a football team.

23:35.682 --> 23:37.450
Love you to join.

23:37.450 --> 23:38.885
Will you teach me
to football?

23:38.885 --> 23:40.352
Sure we'll teach you
to football.

23:40.352 --> 23:41.988
Won't we, Caretaker?

23:41.988 --> 23:44.023
Hey, I'll teach ya anything.
Just don't eat me.

23:44.023 --> 23:45.224
( laughing )

23:45.224 --> 23:46.425
Okay.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.461
( laughing )

23:48.461 --> 23:51.030
Down, Shrek. Down!

23:51.030 --> 23:52.231
( whistle blows )

23:52.231 --> 23:53.733
PAUL: Okay, bring it in.

23:53.733 --> 23:56.402
Whoever's tryin' out
for the team, wake up.

23:56.402 --> 23:58.104
Can ya give a brother
a little hustle?

23:58.104 --> 23:59.872
PAUL: Very good.

23:59.872 --> 24:01.541
For those of you
who don't know who I am,

24:01.541 --> 24:03.142
I'm Paul Crewe.

24:03.142 --> 24:06.513
I'm gonna be your coach,
your captain, your quarterback.

24:06.513 --> 24:09.015
You haven't played in years.
Why can't I be quarterback, huh?

24:09.015 --> 24:10.617
You're right.
Let's see what you got.

24:10.617 --> 24:12.619
All right.
Hit me, I'm open.

24:12.619 --> 24:14.153
Hike, hike! Hike!

24:14.153 --> 24:15.855
That's why. Now, sit down
and shut up.

24:15.855 --> 24:18.791
It slipped. I just ate popcorn.
Question:

24:18.791 --> 24:22.028
Any of you gentlemen
ever play football before?

24:22.028 --> 24:24.196
Ya did? Where?
Kansas State.

24:24.196 --> 24:26.666
Are you shittin' me?
For Coach Snyder?

24:26.666 --> 24:28.735
Nah. Kansas State Prison.

24:29.669 --> 24:31.037
Now I hear they have

24:31.037 --> 24:33.540
the softest mattresses
out there.

24:33.540 --> 24:34.907
Yeah, they do.
Not as soft as the ones

24:34.907 --> 24:36.909
at West Texas
Mental Institution.

24:36.909 --> 24:37.977
Really?

24:37.977 --> 24:39.612
Let's finish
this conversation later.

24:39.612 --> 24:41.881
For now, I wanna see
what ya got out there.

24:41.881 --> 24:45.384
Uh, we'll grade 'em
on a scale of one to ten.

24:45.384 --> 24:46.653
PAUL: Move it!

24:46.653 --> 24:48.054
Hustle, hustle,
hustle!

24:48.054 --> 24:49.321
Give these guys sixes.

24:49.321 --> 24:50.757
Give these guys fives.

24:50.757 --> 24:53.593
Good. Good. Give 'em threes.

24:53.593 --> 24:56.128
Very nice!

24:56.128 --> 24:57.564
Aren't we
missin' somebody?

24:57.564 --> 24:59.265
Where's
the Kansas State guy?

24:59.265 --> 25:01.133
* Sittin' in a nest
Of bad men *

25:01.133 --> 25:03.903
You assholes
better not cut me!

25:03.903 --> 25:06.405
I'm still on this team!

25:06.405 --> 25:07.674
Negative two.

25:07.674 --> 25:10.076
All right,
go with negative two.

25:10.076 --> 25:11.343
Hey!

25:11.343 --> 25:13.479
Somebody bring me a Diet Coke!

25:13.479 --> 25:16.015
Let's do this!
That's it!

25:16.015 --> 25:18.918
Five.

25:18.918 --> 25:20.587
Good. Seven.

25:20.587 --> 25:21.854
Stupid tire!

25:21.854 --> 25:23.790
You're a frickin' tire!

25:23.790 --> 25:25.257
You think
you're better than me?!

25:25.257 --> 25:27.393
I'll kick your ass!

25:27.393 --> 25:29.161
Three.

25:30.630 --> 25:32.264
And a half?

25:32.264 --> 25:34.734
Yeah. That's better.

25:34.734 --> 25:36.435
Okay. Good.

25:36.435 --> 25:39.238
( whistle blows )
INMATE: Yeah. There ya go, man.

25:39.238 --> 25:40.506
Four.

25:40.506 --> 25:41.708
( blows whistle )

25:41.708 --> 25:42.909
( grunts )

25:42.909 --> 25:45.011
Five. I don't know.
I go.

25:45.011 --> 25:48.280
CARETAKER:
Come on, Switowski!

25:48.280 --> 25:49.982
Daddy!

25:52.819 --> 25:54.420
Oh, man! Did you see that?

25:54.420 --> 25:56.255
He got it
off the hinge.

25:56.255 --> 25:57.456
I think that's a 10.

25:57.456 --> 25:58.991
Let's go with a 10.

25:58.991 --> 26:00.192
I'm sorry.

26:00.192 --> 26:02.494
I brokeded your toy.

26:02.494 --> 26:03.730
No, that's a good thing.

26:03.730 --> 26:04.964
You should have
a victory hug

26:04.964 --> 26:06.999
with Caretaker.
What?

26:06.999 --> 26:09.268
What you talkin' 'bout, man?

26:09.268 --> 26:11.170
Hey!

26:11.170 --> 26:13.873
Asshole!

26:13.873 --> 26:15.708
Okay, fellas,
it's pretty simple.

26:15.708 --> 26:16.943
You do a buttonhook.

26:16.943 --> 26:18.377
The rest of you guys
block for me.

26:18.377 --> 26:19.578
I'll take care of the rest.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.748
Okay?
On "go." On "go."

26:21.748 --> 26:24.016
Ready? Break!

26:26.686 --> 26:28.087
We'll work on that.

26:28.087 --> 26:30.189
Okay, half speed
on this one, guys.

26:30.189 --> 26:32.725
Slow and easy.

26:32.725 --> 26:35.161
Ready?! Go!

26:42.501 --> 26:44.170
Oh! Stop it!

26:49.942 --> 26:52.311
Stop the violence!

26:52.311 --> 26:55.014
Can't we all get along?!

26:56.615 --> 26:58.751
( screeches )

27:03.555 --> 27:05.825
Hey, Paul.
Unger.

27:05.825 --> 27:08.094
Team's lookin' great.
Oh, yeah.

27:08.094 --> 27:09.929
So are you.
Yep. Workin' on it.

27:09.929 --> 27:12.531
The blood of the guards
is gonna flow

27:12.531 --> 27:15.467
like the rivers
of ancient Babylon.

27:15.467 --> 27:16.703
That's good news.

27:16.703 --> 27:19.038
Unger, you're the man.

27:20.239 --> 27:22.008
Good job today.
You're all startin' to look

27:22.008 --> 27:23.542
really sharp out there.

27:23.542 --> 27:25.611
Yeah.
See ya tomorrow.

27:25.611 --> 27:27.313
We're gonna suck.

27:27.313 --> 27:29.348
Yeah. No doubt about it.

27:31.083 --> 27:33.753
( mellow folk guitar
theme playing )

27:43.162 --> 27:45.297
You look like you could
use a little help.

27:45.297 --> 27:49.702
No offense, my man, but, uh,
you're a little...seasoned.

27:49.702 --> 27:51.103
"Seasoned"?

27:51.103 --> 27:53.005
I'm not askin' to play.
I'll coach.

27:53.005 --> 27:54.673
I'm Nate Scarborough.

27:54.673 --> 27:57.043
Nate Scarborough?

27:57.043 --> 27:59.912
The Heisman Trophy winner
from Oklahoma?

27:59.912 --> 28:04.050
The inmate from Cellblock D.

28:04.050 --> 28:07.754
But about a hundred years ago,
when I could run and gun...

28:07.754 --> 28:10.757
yeah, I was a Sooner then.

28:10.757 --> 28:12.658
I heard you were dead.

28:12.658 --> 28:13.860
No, I ain't dead.

28:13.860 --> 28:16.562
I've been right here, rotting.

28:16.562 --> 28:20.733
Waiting for a chance to get back
at those sadistic guards.

28:20.733 --> 28:23.669
Waiting. For this.

28:23.669 --> 28:26.072
Well, coach, as you can see,
we don't exactly have

28:26.072 --> 28:27.673
the cream of the crop
to work with here.

28:27.673 --> 28:28.941
Well, what are we
gonna do?

28:28.941 --> 28:30.242
How are we gonna
find players?

28:30.242 --> 28:32.945
How'd they get ya
to go to Florida State?

28:32.945 --> 28:34.947
They recruited me.

28:36.515 --> 28:38.217
I'll get the strippers.

28:38.217 --> 28:39.752
Heh.

28:40.820 --> 28:42.354
HAZEN:
Well, now, Lindsay,

28:42.354 --> 28:44.656
this isn't about credit
or congratulations.

28:44.656 --> 28:45.958
This is about givin' men

28:45.958 --> 28:47.827
who've made mistakes
in their lives

28:47.827 --> 28:50.029
an opportunity
to rise above themselves.

28:50.029 --> 28:53.432
To move beyond
the bars of containment.

28:53.432 --> 28:54.834
Say what?

28:54.834 --> 28:58.137
Oh! What I would do to you.

29:00.406 --> 29:02.474
Meow.

29:02.474 --> 29:04.977
( mellow folk guitar
theme playing )

29:09.581 --> 29:11.617
Yeah.
Nice boot, skin man.

29:11.617 --> 29:13.352
Hey, Crewe, why does he
get to be the kicker?

29:13.352 --> 29:16.155
I was All-State, man.
Let's see what you got.

29:16.155 --> 29:18.057
That's why, you dumbass.

29:18.057 --> 29:20.026
Just go do some laps.

29:20.026 --> 29:21.928
I heard you boys
needed to see me.

29:21.928 --> 29:24.163
NATE:
Yeah. I want ya to meet Skitchy.

29:24.163 --> 29:25.164
Hey, dog.

29:25.164 --> 29:26.833
Check that building
over there.

29:26.833 --> 29:29.301
They keep all the records
in the basement.

29:29.301 --> 29:31.703
He's been here so long,
he knows where everything is.

29:31.703 --> 29:34.106
That ain't necessarily
a good thing, is it?

29:34.106 --> 29:35.441
I had a parole date
in '86.

29:35.441 --> 29:37.743
But I got in a tussle
with a guard and...

29:37.743 --> 29:39.745
One punch and it went away.

29:39.745 --> 29:41.247
Twenty extra years
for one punch?

29:41.247 --> 29:43.816
Well, unfortunately for him,
the guard he punched

29:43.816 --> 29:45.818
just happens to be
the warden now.

29:45.818 --> 29:47.854
Oh, shit. Warden Hazen?

29:47.854 --> 29:49.255
"Oh, shit" is right.

29:49.255 --> 29:51.123
( shouting )

29:51.123 --> 29:53.559
Fight in the yard.
Send backup.

29:53.559 --> 29:55.361
Right on time.

29:55.361 --> 29:56.562
Let's do it.

29:56.562 --> 29:58.364
Let's do it.

30:01.901 --> 30:03.202
Ain't you guys glad

30:03.202 --> 30:04.770
you got a black man
for a friend?

30:04.770 --> 30:06.172
Hell, yeah.

30:06.172 --> 30:08.107
Come on.

30:14.180 --> 30:16.983
NATE:
Hazen has a rating system
for every con.

30:16.983 --> 30:18.417
What's three stars?

30:18.417 --> 30:21.587
The more prone to violence
that the inmate is,

30:21.587 --> 30:23.689
the more stars he gets.

30:23.689 --> 30:25.191
Five stars is the max.

30:25.191 --> 30:27.026
I didn't know that.

30:27.026 --> 30:29.095
Let's see how many stars
my maniacal ass got.

30:30.762 --> 30:32.164
Wow.

30:32.164 --> 30:34.633
Half a star?
That's gotta be a mistake.

30:34.633 --> 30:36.035
Check it again. Check it again.

30:36.035 --> 30:38.170
You're about as maniacal
as a boxful of kittens.

30:38.170 --> 30:39.838
Come on, that's not funny, man.

30:39.838 --> 30:42.274
I'm gonna have to stab somebody
or somethin'. Get my rep up.

30:42.274 --> 30:44.543
Why don't we have
a maniacal pillow fight tonight.

30:44.543 --> 30:45.744
That could get it up some.

30:45.744 --> 30:46.946
SKITCHY: Yeah.

30:46.946 --> 30:48.347
We can sell it to pay-per-view.

30:48.347 --> 30:51.717
Superstar Versus Half-A-Star.

30:51.717 --> 30:53.785
Why don't you shut up
before I slit your throat

30:53.785 --> 30:55.254
and watch the dust
come out.

30:55.254 --> 30:57.189
Come on, guys,
we only got a couple minutes.

30:57.189 --> 30:58.958
How 'bout this guy?

30:58.958 --> 31:00.159
Damn, this fool
got the chair

31:00.159 --> 31:02.061
three times,
ain't died yet.

31:02.061 --> 31:03.930
Well, we may not have
the most talented team,

31:03.930 --> 31:06.498
but we will definitely
have the meanest.

31:06.498 --> 31:08.400

31:08.400 --> 31:10.269

31:34.626 --> 31:37.229
( thudding, man grunting )

31:40.933 --> 31:42.868
What's he
doin' that for?

31:42.868 --> 31:45.571
'Cause he's a freak.

31:45.571 --> 31:46.772
Hey, Sasquatch!

31:46.772 --> 31:48.507
Someone's here
to see ya!

31:48.507 --> 31:50.943
Not too smart
on your part.

31:53.645 --> 31:56.215
Hey.

31:56.215 --> 31:58.684
How's the headbangin'
comin'?

32:00.987 --> 32:03.555
You're bleeding.
Just so you know.

32:04.723 --> 32:05.958
People have told me

32:05.958 --> 32:08.294
that you and I
look a lot alike,

32:08.294 --> 32:10.862
so I wanted
to see for myself.

32:10.862 --> 32:12.064
( bellows )

32:12.064 --> 32:14.500
I'm gonna take a piss.

32:14.500 --> 32:17.136
You scared him away,
dumbshit.

32:17.136 --> 32:18.937
( laughs )

PAUL:
You're kiddin'.

32:24.210 --> 32:26.845
Five-star Torres
likes The View?

32:26.845 --> 32:28.447
Naw, just Joy Behar.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.382
The good news is she can
breast-feed standing up.

32:30.382 --> 32:33.319
That's it.
( laughs )

32:33.319 --> 32:35.988
Where does she come up
with this shit?

32:37.089 --> 32:38.657
I'm a Star Jones man myself.

32:38.657 --> 32:40.226
I love that big bitch.

32:40.226 --> 32:42.328
VIEIRA:
That was, like,
the furthest thing.

32:42.328 --> 32:43.729
BEHAR:
I got married so young,

32:43.729 --> 32:45.364
so, I mean, they weren't
pressuring me,

32:45.364 --> 32:46.832
the society
was pressuring me...

32:46.832 --> 32:48.367
Mr. Torres.

32:48.367 --> 32:50.969
Us convicts are startin' up
a football team.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.804
Not interested.

32:52.804 --> 32:54.640
We're playin' the guards.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.876
Walk away.

32:57.876 --> 32:59.911
Good idea.

32:59.911 --> 33:01.947
PAUL:
0 for 2.

33:01.947 --> 33:04.416
HASSELBECK:
You're puttin' the pressure
on her right now.

33:04.416 --> 33:05.717
Show's over, amigo.

33:05.717 --> 33:09.355
I still got 15 minutes
of Joy Behar.

33:09.355 --> 33:10.789
Well, I'm cuttin' you short.

33:10.789 --> 33:12.558
Back to your cell,

33:12.558 --> 33:14.326
asswipe.

33:14.326 --> 33:16.328
TORRES:
Hey, white boy.

33:18.297 --> 33:20.566
Cherryhead gonna play?

33:20.566 --> 33:22.434
Yes, he is.

33:24.836 --> 33:28.507

33:28.507 --> 33:30.576
Crewe, don't forget,
I'm gonna be open.

33:30.576 --> 33:32.511
Green 40! Hut!

33:37.816 --> 33:40.219
Ooh!
Damn!

33:41.420 --> 33:43.089
CARETAKER:
Brucie. Brucie.

33:43.089 --> 33:44.623
You all right?
You breathin'?

33:44.623 --> 33:46.024
I got a bird.

33:46.024 --> 33:47.993
His name is Ronnie.

33:47.993 --> 33:49.195
Well, tell Ronnie

33:49.195 --> 33:51.363
you got knocked
the fuck out.

33:53.599 --> 33:55.534
Wow, no bullshit.

33:55.534 --> 33:57.002
Real football?

33:57.002 --> 33:58.204
Against the guards?

33:58.204 --> 33:59.538
Full contact.

33:59.538 --> 34:01.640
Captain Knauer
is their quarterback?

34:01.640 --> 34:04.276
Yep.

34:04.276 --> 34:06.011
So I get to tackle him.

34:06.011 --> 34:07.413
Yeah. You can either tackle him,

34:07.413 --> 34:10.815
or hit him over the head
with that hammer.

34:10.815 --> 34:12.717
I wanna hurt him. Not kill him.

34:12.717 --> 34:15.387
CARETAKER:
Let's get out of here before
that thing bites somebody.

34:15.387 --> 34:18.757
All right. We'll see you and
your pet iguana at practice.

34:18.757 --> 34:20.092
( whistle blows )

34:20.092 --> 34:21.827
PAUL: Down, set!

34:23.862 --> 34:26.465
Hut! Hut!

34:30.034 --> 34:32.170
Hey!

34:32.170 --> 34:34.806
Hit me!
Get rid of it.

34:34.806 --> 34:36.574
Get rid of it!

34:37.909 --> 34:39.710
He didn't get rid of it.

34:39.710 --> 34:41.179
( whistle blows )

34:41.179 --> 34:43.014
Sacked your ass.

34:43.014 --> 34:46.217
Somebody's gotta
get open, guys.

34:46.217 --> 34:47.953
You got hammered
by the hammer.

34:47.953 --> 34:49.554
I think I felt it
on my leg.

34:49.554 --> 34:51.089
We gotta get
some speed, man.

34:51.089 --> 34:53.391
Well, what'd you expect?
You got no brothers out there.

34:53.391 --> 34:55.360
What are you talkin' about?
We got Switowski.

34:55.360 --> 34:58.530
Switowski,
that's one brother.

34:58.530 --> 35:00.732
That's a lonely nigger.
This ain't hockey.

35:00.732 --> 35:01.933
You want some speed,

35:01.933 --> 35:03.402
you know where to go.

35:03.402 --> 35:06.438
( 21G's "U Should Know"

35:11.210 --> 35:15.681
Hey, yo, check out
this fake Slim Shady, man.

35:15.681 --> 35:18.317
I knew
you couldn't resist my shit.

35:18.317 --> 35:20.552
I got the shakes
that'll make you quake.

35:20.552 --> 35:23.555
I got the fries
that'll cross your eyes.

35:23.555 --> 35:26.225
I got the burgers that'll--

35:28.126 --> 35:29.595
I just got burgers.

35:29.595 --> 35:30.796
I'm all right.
Thank you.

35:30.796 --> 35:32.698
Just wanted
to talk to you fellas

35:32.698 --> 35:35.234
about possibly joining
the football team.

35:35.234 --> 35:36.535
Aw, hell, no, man.

35:36.535 --> 35:37.869
The only game
we'd play with you

35:37.869 --> 35:39.638
is Slap the Point-Shavin'
White Boy

35:39.638 --> 35:42.708
Till He Cries
Like a Baby-Back Bitch.

35:42.708 --> 35:45.544

Baby-back bitch *

35:45.544 --> 35:47.145

35:47.145 --> 35:48.680
That's a big-ass robot.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.782
Yeah.

35:54.186 --> 35:56.788
You gonna
help me out here?

35:58.257 --> 35:59.825
Thank you, Half-a-Star.

36:01.427 --> 36:03.028
Just so you know,
we are playing the guards.

36:03.028 --> 36:05.597
That ain't a team. That's just
a bunch of dumb rednecks

36:05.597 --> 36:08.334
givin' themselves excuses
to grab each other.

36:08.334 --> 36:11.570
This guy must be
quite the athlete, huh?

36:11.570 --> 36:14.072
You risk bringin' your ass
in the jungle

36:14.072 --> 36:15.741
because you know I am.

36:15.741 --> 36:19.211
Yeah, so you'd beat me
in a game of one-on-one, right?

36:19.211 --> 36:20.679
What?!

36:20.679 --> 36:22.448
I think it's time
for you to get steppin'.

36:22.448 --> 36:24.750
How's this, though? One game.

36:24.750 --> 36:27.185
I beat you,
you guys play for the team.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.221
You beat me,
I'll leave ya alone.

36:29.221 --> 36:30.656
Take that deal.

36:30.656 --> 36:31.857
Take that.

36:31.857 --> 36:33.225
Take that, Deac.

This fool ain't nothin'
but a thing, baby.

36:35.427 --> 36:38.264
Ball, dog.
Ball up!

36:38.264 --> 36:39.965
Can Crewe play ball?

36:39.965 --> 36:41.333
He's a natural athlete.

36:41.333 --> 36:42.734
So's Greg Louganis,

36:42.734 --> 36:44.870

his ass whupped out here.

Okay.

36:57.249 --> 36:59.017
No, that was clean.

36:59.017 --> 37:01.387
He'll be all right.
Call his mama.

37:01.387 --> 37:02.788
If I foul ya,
you tell me, dog.

37:02.788 --> 37:04.222
Okay, baby.

37:07.793 --> 37:09.928
Take this f--
Take this foul.

37:12.531 --> 37:15.166
What happened there?
I think it's my ball, right?

37:15.166 --> 37:16.902
All right.

37:16.902 --> 37:19.771
Get up! Get up, Deac!
Come on, Paul!

37:19.771 --> 37:20.972
Calm down.

37:20.972 --> 37:23.675
Now, don't stir up
the brothers, now. Come on.

37:35.287 --> 37:36.588
Hell, no, baby.

37:36.588 --> 37:38.357
That was clean. Good D.

37:38.357 --> 37:39.758
I thought he didn't
wanna get hurt.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.327
It ain't about
gettin' hurt.

37:41.327 --> 37:42.828
It's about pride.

37:42.828 --> 37:44.630
I betcha he's
pretty proud right now.

we can get our new

I'll be a'ight for now.

41:06.364 --> 41:09.067
Get yo' country ass
back in the huddle.

41:09.067 --> 41:11.036
That boy got some slave feet,
ya see that?

41:11.036 --> 41:13.271
( whistle blows )

41:13.271 --> 41:15.140
Defense! Huddle up over there!

41:15.140 --> 41:16.842
Paul.

41:16.842 --> 41:18.176
Paul.

41:18.176 --> 41:19.745
Hey, Ladies. How's it hangin'?

41:19.745 --> 41:22.047
Tell him.
I'm gonna say something to him.

41:22.047 --> 41:24.415
I just wanted to let you know
I am your biggest fan.

41:24.415 --> 41:28.053
And I will be cheerin'
my jailhouse boobies off for you

41:28.053 --> 41:29.420
at game day.

41:29.420 --> 41:31.122
I appreciate that. Thank you.

41:31.122 --> 41:33.291
Paul.

41:33.291 --> 41:35.661
I appreciate you.

41:35.661 --> 41:37.996
Okay, thanks.
I'm glad to know that.

41:37.996 --> 41:39.598
( giggling )

41:39.598 --> 41:40.866
Okay, are ya done now?
Huh?

41:40.866 --> 41:42.367
What's wrong wit' you?

41:42.367 --> 41:44.302
Jealous 'cause I don't cheer
for you anymore?

41:44.302 --> 41:46.504
I don't know what you're
talkin' about, freak show.

41:46.504 --> 41:48.173
Whatever, back freckles.

41:48.173 --> 41:51.276
Oh, yeah, back freckles.
She's makin' up shit now.

41:51.276 --> 41:53.011
I'm gonna get some water.

41:53.011 --> 41:55.581
DANDRIDGE:
That feature interview

41:55.581 --> 41:56.782
worked better than I thought.

41:56.782 --> 41:58.750
I just got off the phone
with ESPN2.

41:58.750 --> 42:01.953
They want to televise
the football game.

42:01.953 --> 42:05.624
Guards, cons, Paul Crewe,
it's compelling stuff.

42:05.624 --> 42:08.226
Lots of human interest.
Cha-cha-cha.

42:08.226 --> 42:10.729
Don't do that in here.

42:10.729 --> 42:12.864
Television.

42:12.864 --> 42:15.934
Dandridge, do you think
that might help my visibility

42:15.934 --> 42:18.269
with the registered voters
of this fine state?

42:18.269 --> 42:20.071
Oh, yes.

42:21.840 --> 42:25.043
( ominous rock theme playing )

42:26.344 --> 42:28.279
Come on.

42:36.421 --> 42:39.024
PAPAJOHN:
The freak is back!

42:51.302 --> 42:53.204
Hey, hey. It's me again.

42:53.204 --> 42:54.973
( ball clicking )

42:54.973 --> 42:56.708
You know, if I take
this half down,

42:56.708 --> 42:58.710
we could play together.

43:00.378 --> 43:03.048
I'm just gonna
take this half down.

43:04.582 --> 43:06.017
( ball clatters off table )
Ooh, oh.

43:06.017 --> 43:07.686
Don't worry. Don't worry.

43:07.686 --> 43:09.688
I got another ball.

43:09.688 --> 43:11.489
It's okay.

43:11.489 --> 43:13.759
Ya wanna serve?

43:13.759 --> 43:16.995
I'll serve.

43:20.899 --> 43:22.968
Really good news.

43:22.968 --> 43:24.803
We started
a football team.

43:24.803 --> 43:26.705
You like football?

43:26.705 --> 43:27.973
It's kinda like
Ping-Pong.

43:27.973 --> 43:29.607
Only the ball's
a little bigger

43:29.607 --> 43:31.810
and egg-shaped, like my head.

43:31.810 --> 43:33.244
( laughs awkwardly )

43:33.244 --> 43:34.545
Just a joke.

43:34.545 --> 43:36.014
Stay calm.

43:36.014 --> 43:37.415
Give you a good chance

43:37.415 --> 43:38.917
to throw people
on the ground,

43:38.917 --> 43:41.486
hurt them like you used to
when you were a kid,

43:41.486 --> 43:44.289
10 feet 6 inches ago.

43:44.289 --> 43:45.891
( growls softly )

43:45.891 --> 43:47.959
We'd be playing
the guards.

43:50.595 --> 43:53.298
I think Papajohn's their safety.

43:57.368 --> 43:58.904
( thick accent ):

43:58.904 --> 44:01.707
( hard rock theme playing )

44:11.382 --> 44:12.784
Turley, nobody gets to me,

44:12.784 --> 44:14.652
we'll play more Ping-Pong
later, okay?

44:18.056 --> 44:19.257
Hut!

44:19.257 --> 44:21.793
( growling )

44:23.461 --> 44:25.130
Effective.

44:25.130 --> 44:27.198
( wailing )
All right.

44:27.198 --> 44:29.367
He brokeded my nose.

44:32.437 --> 44:34.539
I don't wanna play
no more.

44:34.539 --> 44:35.741
Hey, hey, hey.
Switowski.

44:35.741 --> 44:36.942
What are you
talkin' about?

44:36.942 --> 44:38.744
This is football.
Shit happens.

44:38.744 --> 44:41.646
Paul, he brokeded my nose.

44:41.646 --> 44:43.148
Okay. Stop cryin'.

44:43.148 --> 44:44.850
All right.
We can fix this.

44:44.850 --> 44:46.084
Here we go.

44:46.084 --> 44:47.685
( bone cracks,
Switowski screams )

44:47.685 --> 44:50.621
Okay. Good, good.

44:50.621 --> 44:51.990
How's it look?

44:51.990 --> 44:54.092
How's it look?
It looks... It looks like--

44:54.092 --> 44:55.526
It looks better
than before.

44:55.526 --> 44:57.395
Really?

44:57.395 --> 44:59.664
Yeah, it's straighter.
More distinguished.

44:59.664 --> 45:01.900
Kinda like
a young Michael Jackson.

45:01.900 --> 45:04.269
I love little Michael.

45:04.269 --> 45:06.104
That's great.
That's great.

45:06.104 --> 45:09.307
I think he did it on purpose.

45:09.307 --> 45:11.442
No, he didn't.

45:13.311 --> 45:15.046
Okay, maybe he did.

45:15.046 --> 45:16.581
You gotta
apologize to him.

45:16.581 --> 45:19.317
Come on, Turley.

45:19.317 --> 45:21.953
PAUL:
Say you're sorry.

45:23.321 --> 45:24.856
Come on. Say it.

45:24.856 --> 45:26.257
( sighs )

45:28.593 --> 45:30.028
He said he's sorry.

45:30.028 --> 45:31.997
I got him
to say he's sorry.

45:31.997 --> 45:33.865
Yeah, yeah.
We're all impressed.

45:33.865 --> 45:36.167
( mellow guitar theme playing )

45:36.167 --> 45:38.904
Looking good, gentlemen.
Way to work hard.

45:38.904 --> 45:40.105
Good practice, Paul!

45:40.105 --> 45:41.306
Me and the girls
wanna show you

45:41.306 --> 45:42.707
what we've been
practicing.

45:42.707 --> 45:43.975
Okay, hit me.

45:43.975 --> 45:45.676
Come on, let's go.

45:45.676 --> 45:47.245
One, two, three.

45:47.245 --> 45:50.315
Give me a...

45:50.315 --> 45:53.852
( chanting ):
D, D, give me a I
I, I, give me a C

45:53.852 --> 45:55.186
C, give me a--

45:55.186 --> 45:56.721
All right, all right! I got it.

45:56.721 --> 45:58.556
Just save it for the game.

45:58.556 --> 46:00.725
Don't act like you ain't want
to see more, Brucie!

46:00.725 --> 46:01.993
Yeah, you wish, pal.

46:01.993 --> 46:03.594
No, you wish
I'd kiss you again,

46:03.594 --> 46:06.164
'cause your breath smell
like eight cans of shark shit.

46:06.164 --> 46:07.999
I wouldn't touch her
with a 10-foot pole.

46:07.999 --> 46:09.767
What's he talkin' about?
He's a freak.

46:09.767 --> 46:13.371
( D12's "My Ballz" playing )

46:13.371 --> 46:15.240
* Football, football
I love football *

46:15.240 --> 46:17.475
* Yes, tres, dos, uno *

46:17.475 --> 46:19.377
* Hut one, hut two, hut, hut
Hurry up *

46:19.377 --> 46:21.512
* Denaun, go long
I'm gonna throw the bomb *

46:21.512 --> 46:23.281
* Come on
Touchdown *

46:23.281 --> 46:26.484
Run, Forrest, run!

46:28.586 --> 46:30.922
( Mountain's "Mississippi Queen
blaring over speaker )

46:30.922 --> 46:33.391
That's how a white man
plays guitar.

46:36.027 --> 46:38.029
Captain,
he said he had some info.

46:38.029 --> 46:39.931
You guys have "Halo 2."

46:39.931 --> 46:42.200
I didn't even think
that was out yet.

46:42.200 --> 46:43.368
Focus.

46:43.368 --> 46:44.936
Turn the music off!
* Mississip-- *

46:44.936 --> 46:46.704
Yeah, captain.
You know them convicts?

46:46.704 --> 46:48.907
They're startin' to get
some serious players.

46:48.907 --> 46:50.108
But their biggest threat?

46:50.108 --> 46:52.177
A running back. Megget.

46:52.177 --> 46:54.880
He's good?
He's fast.

46:54.880 --> 46:57.548
He's really, really fast.

46:57.548 --> 46:58.816
I mean, he's so fast,

46:58.816 --> 47:01.752
he makes fast people
look not fast.

47:01.752 --> 47:03.121
I got it, he's fast.

47:03.121 --> 47:04.455
Now, why don't you
show us your speed

47:04.455 --> 47:06.191
and get your pyro ass
outta here.

47:06.191 --> 47:08.659
Yes, sir. Here I go.

47:08.659 --> 47:10.128
Oh, I'm sorry.

47:21.439 --> 47:26.477
Any books you'd
recommend, inmate?

47:26.477 --> 47:28.413
No, sir.

47:29.915 --> 47:32.150
Not much of a reader.

47:32.150 --> 47:34.052
Oh, come on,
now, maggot.

47:34.052 --> 47:36.221
I've seen you in here
readin' before.

47:36.221 --> 47:39.157
You requested this detail.
Isn't that right?

47:42.393 --> 47:43.761
Nah.

47:43.761 --> 47:46.731
It's the quiet time I like, sir.

47:46.731 --> 47:48.366
Maybe you'd like
to read this.

47:50.701 --> 47:52.637
What the hell kind
of bullshit book is that?

47:52.637 --> 47:54.906
It's historical. Sir.

47:54.906 --> 47:58.043
Now, why would he want to read
a book about a four-eyed nigger?

47:59.510 --> 48:02.013
( chuckling )

48:02.013 --> 48:07.418
Does the N word
offend you, nigger?

48:07.418 --> 48:09.454
No, sir.

48:13.824 --> 48:15.160
( books thump to floor )

48:15.160 --> 48:17.262
Oops.
Sorry about that.

48:19.230 --> 48:21.532
You mind fetching
these books for me, boy?

48:23.935 --> 48:25.536
No, sir.

48:25.536 --> 48:27.973
Just pick 'em up.
Put 'em on the table.

48:30.875 --> 48:34.112
There you go.

48:37.782 --> 48:40.351
You forgot one.

48:46.757 --> 48:48.593
Bet you'd like to hit us, huh?

48:48.593 --> 48:50.661
Hit you, sir?

48:50.661 --> 48:52.097
Nah.

48:54.099 --> 48:56.301
Y'all my friends.

48:59.904 --> 49:02.873
Pick these up.

49:02.873 --> 49:06.144
( books thumping on floor )

49:06.144 --> 49:09.981
( suspenseful theme playing )

49:22.994 --> 49:25.263
Go!

49:25.263 --> 49:28.099
Hit me! I'm open!
I'm open!

49:31.736 --> 49:32.970
Come on!

49:32.970 --> 49:34.839
We got one week
before we play that game.

49:34.839 --> 49:36.074
We can't
complete a pass yet.

49:36.074 --> 49:38.009
Megget can't
run the ball every play.

49:38.009 --> 49:39.477
I know, coach.

49:39.477 --> 49:41.379
What the hell
is he smilin' at?

49:41.379 --> 49:43.748
* Here comes the...
Here comes the... *

49:43.748 --> 49:45.450
* Y'all
Don't really worry now *

49:45.450 --> 49:47.418
* Here comes the
Boom *

49:47.418 --> 49:49.187
* Here comes the
Boom *

49:49.187 --> 49:50.755
* Here comes the... *

49:50.755 --> 49:52.323
* Y'all don't really
Worry now *

49:52.323 --> 49:53.691
* Boom
When I'm coming, like *

49:53.691 --> 49:55.326
* Boom
When I'm coming, like *

49:55.326 --> 49:57.028
* Boom
When I'm coming for ya *

49:57.028 --> 49:59.797
This better be on the up and up.

49:59.797 --> 50:01.932
I guarantee it.

50:01.932 --> 50:03.901
Let's do this shit.

50:03.901 --> 50:05.670
There goes the neighborhood.

50:05.670 --> 50:06.937
( laughing )

50:06.937 --> 50:09.807
( driving electronic theme
playing )

50:09.807 --> 50:11.109
( sobbing )

50:11.109 --> 50:13.378
Now I'll never get to play.

50:22.553 --> 50:24.622
Set. Hut.

50:38.035 --> 50:40.805
Did you see that?!
Did you see that?!

50:40.805 --> 50:42.607
The Deac is here!

50:42.607 --> 50:43.641
Nice!

50:43.641 --> 50:45.543
Okay, we seal off here,
seal off here.

50:45.543 --> 50:47.578
Cheeseburger.
Yeah.

50:47.578 --> 50:49.447
You're just gonna
chip this guy--

50:59.190 --> 51:00.625
( cheering )

51:06.964 --> 51:08.399
That stings.

51:08.399 --> 51:11.502
It's nothin'
a Quarter Pounder can't fix.

51:12.703 --> 51:14.972
With cheese on it?

51:14.972 --> 51:17.375
Hut!

51:25.683 --> 51:28.153
Whoo!

51:40.898 --> 51:42.767
Man, that boy would catch a cold
in the desert.

51:42.767 --> 51:44.969
Here you go.
Everything's looking up.

51:44.969 --> 51:48.839
Yeah, still got one more
pain in the ass to deal with.

51:52.577 --> 51:55.846
( driving country guitar theme
playing )

51:57.315 --> 51:58.549
( siren wails )

51:58.549 --> 52:00.017
All right, boys,
what do you say?

52:00.017 --> 52:01.886
How about
a little best ball?

52:01.886 --> 52:03.120
No, I hate that bullshit.

52:03.120 --> 52:04.889
Everyone play
their own damn ball.

52:04.889 --> 52:06.457
Holy shit, is that Paul Crewe?

52:06.457 --> 52:08.025
HAZEN:
How do you
like that, boys?

52:08.025 --> 52:10.395
The MVP comin'
to kiss my ass.

52:10.395 --> 52:13.130
So, what's on your mind, Paul?

52:13.130 --> 52:15.333
Got a problem
with inmate Unger.

52:15.333 --> 52:17.268
Oh? Is he on your little squad?

52:17.268 --> 52:19.437
I believe
he's on your little squad.

52:19.437 --> 52:23.073
Mr. Crewe, would you mind
if we had a picture? Please?

52:23.073 --> 52:25.176
That's up to the warden.

52:25.176 --> 52:27.312
Aw, damn it.
All right.

52:27.312 --> 52:29.013
Rewound it. Did everything.
The flash is ready.

52:29.013 --> 52:30.681
You don't need a flash.
It's daylight.

52:30.681 --> 52:33.184
Oh, my bad.
I just want a good picture.

52:33.184 --> 52:35.353
You know, I think
you had sex with my wife

52:35.353 --> 52:37.054
before I married her.

52:37.054 --> 52:38.956
Sorry about that.

52:38.956 --> 52:41.626
Oh, hell, no. If she's hot
enough to have a one-nighter

52:41.626 --> 52:43.093
with a pro
football player,

52:43.093 --> 52:44.295
I must be doin'
all right.

52:44.295 --> 52:45.496
( all laughing )

52:45.496 --> 52:47.332
PAUL:
Okay, here we go.

52:47.332 --> 52:49.967
Sergeant Engleheart.
Yes, warden.

52:49.967 --> 52:52.136
Would you
step out of the picture, please?

52:52.136 --> 52:53.938
Yes, sir.

52:55.139 --> 52:56.441
( camera clicks )

52:56.441 --> 52:58.108

His wife has got
the hottest ass.

52:58.108 --> 52:59.310
Great.

52:59.310 --> 53:01.078
Just cut to the chase,
shall we?

53:01.078 --> 53:02.313
You don't
actually think

53:02.313 --> 53:03.781
you have a chance
of winning, now, do you?

53:03.781 --> 53:05.950
We're gonna get
our asses handed to us.

53:05.950 --> 53:07.752
I know it. You know it.

53:07.752 --> 53:09.887
I just don't want
my players to know it.

53:09.887 --> 53:11.656
Your players?

53:11.656 --> 53:13.258
( chuckles )

53:13.258 --> 53:15.960
Just when I thought
I had you all figured out.

53:15.960 --> 53:17.495
What does that mean?

53:17.495 --> 53:18.896
In the time you've been here,

53:18.896 --> 53:20.831
you haven't made or received
one telephone call.

53:20.831 --> 53:23.401
You haven't opened so much
as a single shred of mail.

53:23.401 --> 53:25.836
What do you give a damn
about those slimeballs?

53:25.836 --> 53:28.038
You never cared about anybody
in your entire life.

53:28.038 --> 53:30.708
Maybe I finally found
the sense of family

53:30.708 --> 53:32.743
I been yearning for
since I'm a baby.

53:32.743 --> 53:35.413
( Southern accent ):
And gosh almighty,

53:35.413 --> 53:36.981
my new family and I
would sure appreciate it

53:36.981 --> 53:39.517
if you got Unger off the field.
You hear?

53:40.585 --> 53:42.287
Sergeant Engleheart.

53:42.287 --> 53:44.255
Thank you.

53:44.255 --> 53:46.291
Oh, and as for
your request...

53:47.692 --> 53:50.895
you'll have my answer
soon enough.

53:50.895 --> 53:54.699
( country guitar theme plays )

54:03.140 --> 54:05.343
Did it rain last night?

54:05.343 --> 54:06.844
Not a drop.

54:08.413 --> 54:10.781
( laughing )

54:10.781 --> 54:13.418
Son of a bitch.

54:13.418 --> 54:16.521
All right, boys.

54:18.055 --> 54:21.759
The warden is tryin'
to break our spirit.

54:21.759 --> 54:24.595
He thinks we're gonna
skip practice today,

54:24.595 --> 54:27.398
wait for the field to dry,
make it up tomorrow.

54:27.398 --> 54:28.733
You know what?
Who gives a shit?

54:28.733 --> 54:30.501
Three days
till game time.

54:30.501 --> 54:31.969
We can handle it.

54:31.969 --> 54:34.605
But lemme say this:

54:34.605 --> 54:38.609
That old man flooding this field
tells me somethin'.

54:38.609 --> 54:41.912
The guy is scared.

54:41.912 --> 54:45.616
Scared of you sick,
degenerate convicts.

54:45.616 --> 54:47.352
( inmates chuckling )

54:47.352 --> 54:49.887
And you know what?

54:49.887 --> 54:51.489
He should be.

54:51.489 --> 54:53.691
'Cause I got news
for you guys.

54:53.691 --> 54:55.726
We're gonna win this thing.

54:56.861 --> 54:58.463
Did he say "win"?

54:58.463 --> 55:01.098
What's it gonna be, boys?

55:01.098 --> 55:03.368
Do we go back to our cells,

55:03.368 --> 55:05.503
call it a day?

55:05.503 --> 55:07.405
Or do we get ourselves ready

55:07.405 --> 55:10.675
for the greatest
ass-kicking fiesta...

55:10.675 --> 55:13.411
in the history of football?

55:13.411 --> 55:15.780
I'll leave it up to you guys.

55:20.150 --> 55:21.952
( both chuckling )

55:21.952 --> 55:24.422

55:36.667 --> 55:38.703
You're part of
the goddamn team.

55:38.703 --> 55:42.206
Get your
point-shavin' ass in there.

55:42.206 --> 55:44.509
You got it. Yaaah!

Have you ever seen the rain? *

* I want to know
Have you ever seen the rain *

56:24.815 --> 56:29.687
* Comin' down on a sunny day? *

56:29.687 --> 56:33.190
I guess that asshole Hazen
wants to play dirty.

56:33.190 --> 56:34.425
We all convicts,
right?

56:34.425 --> 56:35.893
Right.

56:35.893 --> 56:38.596
Maybe it's time we started
actin' like it.

56:39.897 --> 56:42.032
( whispering ):
Right here. Right here.

Yo, Crewe!

58:55.566 --> 58:57.602
Yes, Mr. Caretaker.

58:57.602 --> 58:59.036
Check your toilet.

58:59.036 --> 59:01.005
There should be a little
surprise in there for you.

59:01.005 --> 59:03.073
You took a shit in my toilet?

59:03.073 --> 59:05.976
No, that's the surprise
I left in Brucie's toilet.

59:05.976 --> 59:07.377
You got
somethin' else.

59:07.377 --> 59:08.879
All right.

59:08.879 --> 59:10.781
Well, would you look at this.

59:10.781 --> 59:14.719
A bottle of Ketel One
and two glasses.

59:14.719 --> 59:16.687
Now, what would I need two for?

59:16.687 --> 59:18.789
Just shut up
and pour me a drink, bitch.

59:18.789 --> 59:22.326
Man, who taught you
to be so cool?

59:22.326 --> 59:23.560
My mama.

59:23.560 --> 59:25.029
Now, when I get outta here,

59:25.029 --> 59:27.798
I don't want you to get
all Hollywood on us.

59:27.798 --> 59:29.600
I want you to meet her.

59:29.600 --> 59:31.535
Here, look at my girl.

59:31.535 --> 59:33.537
She's your biggest fan.

Here's to, uh...

Hey, I thought
I was your friend, Paul.

You are, Switowski.

and go back to sleep.

59:55.459 --> 59:56.994
Okay.

59:56.994 --> 59:58.663
And here's to havin'
one of these with you

59:58.663 --> 59:59.997
on the outside,

59:59.997 --> 01:00:02.366
sometime in the next
three to five years.

01:00:05.535 --> 01:00:06.804
Yes, sir.

01:00:06.804 --> 01:00:08.773
You bein'
a ex-football player and all,

01:00:08.773 --> 01:00:10.808
I'm sure you got a lotta hot ass
on the outside.

01:00:10.808 --> 01:00:12.242
Well, let's not forget

01:00:12.242 --> 01:00:14.444
I wasn't the most popular guy
out there.

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:15.713
Don't gimme that shit.

his wife's head off

01:00:17.214 --> 01:00:18.582
and still got some ass.

01:00:18.582 --> 01:00:20.785
Yeah.

01:00:20.785 --> 01:00:22.452
My mama taught me
not to kiss and tell.

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:23.788
Now go to sleep.
All right.

01:00:23.788 --> 01:00:25.522
I got one more question
to ask you.

01:00:25.522 --> 01:00:28.392
Okay. What is it?

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:32.129
Why'd you shave those points?

01:00:34.665 --> 01:00:36.266
Didn't you read the papers?

01:00:36.266 --> 01:00:37.601
I'm innocent.

01:00:37.601 --> 01:00:41.038
Yeah. Ain't we all?

01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:43.708
Yo, Crewe,

01:00:43.708 --> 01:00:45.710
what would you say
if I could get you film

01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:47.812
from the guards' games
last year?

01:00:47.812 --> 01:00:49.379
I would say
that's incredible,

01:00:49.379 --> 01:00:50.580
but how?

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:52.717
Thanks, gentlemen.

01:00:52.717 --> 01:00:54.251
The warden will be
done with him

01:00:54.251 --> 01:00:56.854
in 15 minutes.

01:00:56.854 --> 01:00:59.256
We can handle him.

01:00:59.256 --> 01:01:00.290
Yes, ma'am.

01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:03.160
Then you're
gonna, ma'am.

01:01:06.563 --> 01:01:09.900
Nice job.

01:01:11.301 --> 01:01:13.403
I can't tell you
how much this means to me.

01:01:13.403 --> 01:01:14.905
Thank you, Lynette.

01:01:14.905 --> 01:01:17.041
Now Nate can study
all the guards' formations.

01:01:17.041 --> 01:01:20.010
Not so fast,
sugar bear.

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:22.046
You gotta earn 'em.

01:01:32.289 --> 01:01:33.858
We only got 15 minutes,

01:01:33.858 --> 01:01:35.125
but, sunshine,

01:01:35.125 --> 01:01:38.195
we're gonna
make 'em all count.

01:01:48.205 --> 01:01:50.640

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.042
One more, please?

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:53.243
Mm-hmm.

01:01:55.679 --> 01:01:58.816
Whoa! Whoa!

01:01:58.816 --> 01:02:00.684

01:02:00.684 --> 01:02:03.788
Let's go.

01:02:09.794 --> 01:02:12.162
Quiet down. Guys.
Let's go.

01:02:12.162 --> 01:02:15.132
Before we watch the guards'
game film from last season,

01:02:15.132 --> 01:02:17.034
we have a special presentation

01:02:17.034 --> 01:02:19.870

Mr. Paul Crewe.

What's goin' on?

( inmates whooping
and whistling )

01:02:30.047 --> 01:02:33.217
Now I gotta
relive this shit?

01:02:49.133 --> 01:02:51.135
Yeah!

01:02:53.603 --> 01:02:54.872
You can say this!

01:02:54.872 --> 01:02:57.241
My man's a team player!

01:02:58.542 --> 01:03:00.010
You know what they say.

01:03:00.010 --> 01:03:02.813
Once you go gray,
there ain't no other way!

01:03:02.813 --> 01:03:04.314
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Brucie! Brucie!

01:03:04.314 --> 01:03:06.250
I'm glad you think
that's funny,

01:03:06.250 --> 01:03:08.285
'cause I got somethin' pretty
funny to show you guys.

01:03:08.285 --> 01:03:11.355

What? It's good.
It's good. It keeps goin'.

01:03:22.132 --> 01:03:24.168
Hi. Here I am.

01:03:24.168 --> 01:03:26.236
Turn this shit off.
Turn it off.

01:03:26.236 --> 01:03:28.205
No!

01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:37.281
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Very funny.
Trick photography.

BRUCIE:
Nah, nah, nah. Nah.

01:03:45.289 --> 01:03:46.957
Nothin' happened.
Nothin' happened.

01:03:46.957 --> 01:03:49.326
I was showin' a little
wrestling move. That's all.

01:03:49.326 --> 01:03:50.995
Knock it off!

01:03:50.995 --> 01:03:52.863
Knock it off!

01:03:52.863 --> 01:03:55.099
It's time we took a look
at what we came here to see

01:03:55.099 --> 01:03:56.901
before the guards come back.

01:03:56.901 --> 01:03:59.336
( inmates cheer )
The first film

01:03:59.336 --> 01:04:01.805
is the guards' offense
against Texas Southern.

01:04:01.805 --> 01:04:03.007
Now, as you can see,

01:04:03.007 --> 01:04:06.143
they're running
a standard wishbone.

01:04:12.049 --> 01:04:13.951
So you're tellin' me
that these animals

01:04:13.951 --> 01:04:16.486
are watchin' our game films.
Is that right?

01:04:16.486 --> 01:04:18.788
Yes, sir, boss.
They got all last season.

01:04:18.788 --> 01:04:22.559
Seems to me that we oughta
do somethin' about this.

01:04:22.559 --> 01:04:24.261
What do you want me to do?

01:04:24.261 --> 01:04:26.763
You're the criminal.
Be creative.

01:04:26.763 --> 01:04:30.400
But on game day,
if I so much as--

01:04:32.636 --> 01:04:34.204
What are you doin'?

01:04:35.805 --> 01:04:37.174
I don't know.

01:04:37.174 --> 01:04:39.276
I've had hot flashes
all shift, and...

01:04:39.276 --> 01:04:41.378
now my nipples
are killin' me.

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:43.447
Why are we talkin'
about your nipples?

01:04:43.447 --> 01:04:45.049
We're not.

01:04:45.049 --> 01:04:46.583
Just go do what
you're doin' here.

01:04:46.583 --> 01:04:49.653
Guys.

01:04:49.653 --> 01:04:52.089
I want Crewe finished.

01:04:52.089 --> 01:04:54.224
Yes, sir. You give me
the inspiration, sir.

01:04:54.224 --> 01:04:55.625
I got somethin' for him.

01:04:57.561 --> 01:05:00.497
Hut!

01:05:04.768 --> 01:05:06.203
Everybody!

01:05:06.203 --> 01:05:07.604
( whistle blows )

01:05:07.604 --> 01:05:09.306
Huddle up!

01:05:11.608 --> 01:05:15.845
Every day,
we've been takin' shit

01:05:15.845 --> 01:05:18.148
for a long time.

01:05:18.148 --> 01:05:21.051
Tomorrow, payback.

01:05:21.051 --> 01:05:23.153
Now, think about that
for a second.

01:05:23.153 --> 01:05:25.956
( dramatic orchestral theme
building )

01:05:34.698 --> 01:05:38.268
( clapping continues )

01:05:44.708 --> 01:05:46.210
( ticking )

01:05:54.518 --> 01:05:57.187
( suspenseful action theme
playing )

01:06:07.297 --> 01:06:10.100
What time is it?
ALL: Game time!

01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:11.301
What time is it?

01:06:11.301 --> 01:06:13.603
Game time!
What time is it?

01:06:13.603 --> 01:06:16.040
Game time!

01:06:18.875 --> 01:06:20.977
PAUL:
Tomorrow, 12:00,

01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:24.048
the bus leaves.
Don't be late!

01:06:24.048 --> 01:06:27.251
Where the hell
is Caretaker?

01:06:27.251 --> 01:06:29.586
I don't know.

01:06:47.804 --> 01:06:50.940
( on radio ):
* Little bit of-- *

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:54.044
* --that's how most folks
Make their way *

01:06:55.779 --> 01:06:57.247
* Yodel-ay-hee *

01:06:57.247 --> 01:07:00.850
A gift for you, Mr. Crewe.

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:02.219
* Oh, yodel-ay *

01:07:02.219 --> 01:07:04.488
How's he listen
to that cracker shit?

01:07:10.094 --> 01:07:12.362
( ominous theme playing )

01:07:17.334 --> 01:07:19.303
( sombre theme playing )

01:07:28.578 --> 01:07:32.182
( plaintive country guitar theme
playing )

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:35.212
( Norman Greenbaum's
"Spirit in the Sky" playing )

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:54.863
* When I die
And they lay me to rest *

01:08:54.863 --> 01:08:58.301
* Gonna go to the place
That's the best *

01:08:58.301 --> 01:09:02.005
* When they lay me
Down to die *

01:09:02.005 --> 01:09:05.774
* Going up
To the spirit in the sky *

01:09:05.774 --> 01:09:10.747
* Going up
To the spirit in the sky *

01:09:10.747 --> 01:09:13.450
( siren wails )

01:09:13.450 --> 01:09:17.086
* When I die
And they lay me to rest *

01:09:17.086 --> 01:09:22.192
* I'm gonna go to the place
That's the best *

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:35.205
ROME:
We're here deep in the heart
of toothless country,

01:09:35.205 --> 01:09:37.441
coming to you from a simple
Texas high school stadium

01:09:37.441 --> 01:09:40.644
that's been retrofitted
for the big event.

01:09:40.644 --> 01:09:42.546
Now, when my man Travis
tried to drag me out here,

01:09:42.546 --> 01:09:43.912
I said, "What are you,
brain-dead

01:09:43.912 --> 01:09:45.715
"from talkin' to too many
Raider fans?

01:09:45.715 --> 01:09:47.850
It's not going to work."
But the fact of the matter is,

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:50.053
this could shape up
as an epic day.

01:09:50.053 --> 01:09:52.389
Hot-dog vendors,
high-powered rifles,

01:09:52.389 --> 01:09:53.590
I love the combination.

01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:56.226
And apparently
so do the fans.

01:09:59.896 --> 01:10:01.498
Hey, shitheads! Listen up!

01:10:01.498 --> 01:10:03.667
Everybody on their feet
for the warden.

01:10:07.437 --> 01:10:10.574
Anthony, wow. You can sit down.

01:10:10.574 --> 01:10:13.209
Thank God.

01:10:14.311 --> 01:10:15.712
Gentlemen...

01:10:15.712 --> 01:10:18.248
Texas marshals have been
kind enough to supply us

01:10:18.248 --> 01:10:20.717
with a dozen of their
finest sharpshooters.

01:10:20.717 --> 01:10:22.519
So for those
of you thinkin'

01:10:22.519 --> 01:10:24.388
of mingling
with the civilians...

01:10:24.388 --> 01:10:26.990
or tryin' to make
a break for it...

01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:28.958
you will be shot.

01:10:30.159 --> 01:10:31.828
In the head.

01:10:35.832 --> 01:10:39.603
Now, let's all go out there
and have some fun!

01:10:40.937 --> 01:10:42.138
Crewe!

01:10:42.138 --> 01:10:44.374
I'll see you
on the field!

01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:48.745
I think he's in love with you.

01:10:48.745 --> 01:10:51.848
PAUL:
All right, listen up.

01:10:51.848 --> 01:10:53.783
I know it's hard
to get psyched for the game

01:10:53.783 --> 01:10:56.085
without Caretaker bein' here.

01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:57.954
But somehow

01:10:57.954 --> 01:10:59.389
that sick, skinny bastard

01:10:59.389 --> 01:11:01.358
found a way
to get us all fired up

01:11:01.358 --> 01:11:03.893
from beyond the grave.

01:11:03.893 --> 01:11:07.163
Caretaker's
last gift to us.

01:11:07.163 --> 01:11:10.266
Battle, I presume this is yours.

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:11.735
( inmates laughing )

01:11:11.735 --> 01:11:14.270
I still don't think
that's big enough.

01:11:15.972 --> 01:11:18.842
That's it?
No, that ain't it.

01:11:18.842 --> 01:11:21.645
Caretaker said he'd find us
some gear to wear.

01:11:21.645 --> 01:11:24.013
( inmates cheering )

01:11:25.148 --> 01:11:27.584
I think he found us a name too.

01:11:27.584 --> 01:11:30.019
( triumphant string theme
playing )

01:11:33.357 --> 01:11:37.494
ALL ( chanting ):
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

01:11:37.494 --> 01:11:38.995
( driving backbeat playing )

01:11:42.799 --> 01:11:45.369
* Oh *
* When I got the microphone *

01:11:45.369 --> 01:11:48.304
* Oh *
* When I'm flowin' on and on *

01:11:48.304 --> 01:11:49.839
BERMAN:
Good afternoon,

01:11:49.839 --> 01:11:52.442
and welcome
to a very special edition

01:11:52.442 --> 01:11:54.077
of ESPN football, as today

01:11:54.077 --> 01:11:56.713
the semipro Allenville
Federal Prison guards

01:11:56.713 --> 01:11:59.649
will be taking on
the very prisoners they guard.

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:01.317
And with this
special game, folks,

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:03.052
comes a special
broadcast,

01:12:03.052 --> 01:12:06.790
as I'm joined in the booth
by Baby Face Bob.

01:12:06.790 --> 01:12:08.858
Say hi to the folks,
Bob-O.

01:12:10.827 --> 01:12:12.195
MAN:
Chris, we went
to a commercial.

01:12:12.195 --> 01:12:15.399
This job, Bob,
it's a lotta give and take.

01:12:15.399 --> 01:12:16.733
So when I bring ya in,

01:12:16.733 --> 01:12:18.835
don't be afraid
to talk to the folks.

01:12:20.036 --> 01:12:23.540
Unless you don't want to.

01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:25.775
( Ludacris' "Get Back" playing )

01:12:25.775 --> 01:12:27.844
BERMAN:
And here come the cons,

01:12:27.844 --> 01:12:32.081
led by former NFL
MVP quarterback Paul Crewe.

01:12:32.081 --> 01:12:34.050
( booing )

01:12:34.050 --> 01:12:36.753
( cheering )

01:12:36.753 --> 01:12:38.922
CHEESEBURGER EDDY:
Holy shit.

01:12:38.922 --> 01:12:40.890
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Well, hello. How are you?

01:12:40.890 --> 01:12:43.460
MARSHAL:
Back away
from the girls!

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:47.030
Hey, now.
Call me!

01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:49.365
What the hell
are you dressed up for?

01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:51.200
Hey, I didn't spend 14 years
in the joint

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:53.036
just to watch this game.

01:12:53.036 --> 01:12:55.338
BERMAN:
And there in the high-security
bleachers

01:12:55.338 --> 01:12:57.073
are the "good behavior" cons,

01:12:57.073 --> 01:12:58.542
along with their...

01:12:58.542 --> 01:13:00.610
cheerleaders?

01:13:00.610 --> 01:13:03.246
ALL ( chanting ):
We're the Mean Machine
Don't mean to diss ya

01:13:03.246 --> 01:13:06.115
We're gonna kick your ass
And then we'll kiss ya

01:13:06.115 --> 01:13:08.117
Hey! Ho!

01:13:08.117 --> 01:13:09.653
What?

01:13:09.653 --> 01:13:11.320
( scattered cheers
and whistles )

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:14.123
I didn't do it!

01:13:14.123 --> 01:13:17.126
( AC/DC's "Thunderstruck"
playing )

01:13:24.668 --> 01:13:26.503
( whistles )
Come on, Batt!

01:13:28.371 --> 01:13:30.039
( blows whistle )

01:13:32.742 --> 01:13:35.712
( crowd roaring )

01:13:35.712 --> 01:13:37.914
* Thunder! *

01:13:41.518 --> 01:13:43.386
What's that?
Did you see that?

01:13:43.386 --> 01:13:45.889
* Thunderstruck *

01:13:45.889 --> 01:13:47.323
* Thunderstruck *

01:13:47.323 --> 01:13:48.558
Damn it!

01:13:48.558 --> 01:13:49.926
* Yeah, yeah, yeah *

01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:52.662
BERMAN:
Papajohn's at the 20, the 10.

01:13:52.662 --> 01:13:54.864
And he will score.

01:13:57.433 --> 01:14:00.069
Sweet dreams, bitch.

01:14:00.069 --> 01:14:02.105
BERMAN:
That's a 90-yard return.

01:14:02.105 --> 01:14:04.440
And I gotta tell ya,
the cons seem more interested

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:05.775
in hitting the guards

01:14:05.775 --> 01:14:07.944
than tackling
the ball carrier.

01:14:07.944 --> 01:14:09.145
Hey, Mom.

01:14:09.145 --> 01:14:10.446
Hey, Dad.

01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:14.450
Thanks for pickin' me up
from school.

01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:16.352
BERMAN:
And here comes the big story
of the day.

01:14:16.352 --> 01:14:18.588
Paul Crewe, serving
a three-year sentence,

01:14:18.588 --> 01:14:21.457
hasn't played since he was
banned from the NFL

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:22.659
six years ago.

01:14:22.659 --> 01:14:24.327
Center, shift it!

01:14:24.327 --> 01:14:26.162
Shift it!

01:14:29.332 --> 01:14:31.167
Hey, Sasquatch!

01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:36.740
Twenty, hut!

01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:38.341
BERMAN:
Crewe drops back to pass.

01:14:38.341 --> 01:14:40.510
Turley's leaving him
unprotected.

01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:42.411
Fumble!

01:14:42.411 --> 01:14:45.281
( bellows )

01:14:45.281 --> 01:14:46.783
Holy shit!

01:14:48.451 --> 01:14:50.186
Goddamn it.

01:14:50.186 --> 01:14:53.222
BERMAN:
That's gonna be a personal foul
on the big guy.

01:14:53.222 --> 01:14:54.991
And this is certainly
an inauspicious start

01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:56.425
for the cons.
Come here!

01:14:56.425 --> 01:14:58.027
All right!
You got him.

01:14:58.027 --> 01:14:59.295
Now protect me!

01:14:59.295 --> 01:15:01.865
Let's go! Hold 'em!

01:15:01.865 --> 01:15:03.733
BERMAN:
And here comes Knauer

01:15:03.733 --> 01:15:07.170
and that big offensive unit
for the guards.

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:13.209
Eighty-six.

01:15:13.209 --> 01:15:15.411
Back to your cell.

01:15:15.411 --> 01:15:17.013
Hut! Hut!

01:15:22.719 --> 01:15:27.490
BERMAN:
Knauer has Potter wide open.
Touchdown, guards.

01:15:27.490 --> 01:15:29.893
And in the first 90 seconds,

01:15:29.893 --> 01:15:32.261
the guards are up
by two touchdowns.

01:15:32.261 --> 01:15:36.032
This one looks
like it could be over early.

01:15:36.032 --> 01:15:37.533
Sorry.

01:15:37.533 --> 01:15:39.235
What are we celebratin' for?!

01:15:39.235 --> 01:15:40.670
It's 14-nothing!

01:15:40.670 --> 01:15:42.471
You guys wanna beat
these assholes,

01:15:42.471 --> 01:15:44.373
do it on the scoreboard!

01:15:44.373 --> 01:15:46.209
Are you okay?

01:15:46.209 --> 01:15:48.778
Oh, God,
you're not hurt, are you?

01:15:48.778 --> 01:15:50.379
Jesus, you sound like my mother.

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:53.817
Listen, if you wanna cry,
you go ahead and cry.

01:15:53.817 --> 01:15:55.484
I'll cry with you.

01:15:55.484 --> 01:15:56.686
Get off me!

01:15:56.686 --> 01:15:58.421
Get back out there
and kick some ass!

01:15:58.421 --> 01:15:59.723
Why are you yelling at me?

01:15:59.723 --> 01:16:02.125
All I did was care!

01:16:02.125 --> 01:16:03.326
( sniffles )

01:16:03.326 --> 01:16:04.794
Look!

01:16:04.794 --> 01:16:07.063
A broken leg will heal.

01:16:07.063 --> 01:16:10.333
A loss to the Mean Machine
lasts forever.

01:16:11.701 --> 01:16:14.103
Sorry, guys.

01:16:14.103 --> 01:16:16.005
Yeah, yeah. Me too.

01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:19.976
All right.
Now, let's get started!

01:16:19.976 --> 01:16:21.778
Now, get the hell out there!
Let's go!

01:16:21.778 --> 01:16:23.913
ALL:
Mean Machine!

01:16:25.148 --> 01:16:27.751
( fast country-rock playing )

01:16:38.361 --> 01:16:39.663
Way to go! Way to go!

01:16:39.663 --> 01:16:41.330
BERMAN:
There's the first sign of life

01:16:41.330 --> 01:16:42.598
from the cons.

01:16:42.598 --> 01:16:45.068
Let's see if
Paul "Motley" Crewe

01:16:45.068 --> 01:16:46.936
can make something
happen.

01:16:46.936 --> 01:16:48.337
Hut!

01:16:48.337 --> 01:16:50.039
BERMAN:
On first down,
Crewe will throw.

01:16:50.039 --> 01:16:53.142
He's got Deacon wide open.

01:16:53.142 --> 01:16:55.779
That's gotta be
pass interference.

01:16:55.779 --> 01:16:58.247
But the ref is waving it off.

01:16:58.247 --> 01:17:00.249
What?!
Oh, come on!

01:17:00.249 --> 01:17:02.919
Come on, now. I'm in this
hellhole for less than that.

01:17:02.919 --> 01:17:04.453
Be a man
and make a call.

01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:05.789
You're right.

01:17:05.789 --> 01:17:08.291
Unsportsmanlike conduct!
Eighty-eight, black!

01:17:08.291 --> 01:17:09.492
What?!

01:17:09.492 --> 01:17:11.060
( jeering )

01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:12.361
Come on!

01:17:13.963 --> 01:17:15.631
This is baby-back
bullshit!

01:17:15.631 --> 01:17:16.833
Bullshit, D.

01:17:16.833 --> 01:17:18.201
Calm down.
Let it go.

01:17:18.201 --> 01:17:21.170
Let's call that one
a questionable call.

01:17:21.170 --> 01:17:23.072
Blue 42, hut!

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:26.209
BERMAN:
The give is to Megget.

01:17:26.209 --> 01:17:28.812
He spins to the outside.
Megget has room.

01:17:29.946 --> 01:17:31.447
He's at the 35.

01:17:31.447 --> 01:17:33.216
The 40.

01:17:33.216 --> 01:17:34.483
Oh!

01:17:34.483 --> 01:17:36.352
He's brought down hard,
by his facemask.

01:17:36.352 --> 01:17:37.620
What?

01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:39.122
Aw, come on, man!
That was a facemask!

01:17:39.122 --> 01:17:40.824
You're not gonna call that?

01:17:40.824 --> 01:17:42.025
I saw
a clean tackle, sir.

01:17:42.025 --> 01:17:44.060
What you lookin' at?
Are you serious?

01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:46.963
Tell it to
the parole board, criminal.

01:17:46.963 --> 01:17:48.898
I mean,
this is absurd.

01:17:48.898 --> 01:17:51.100
We can't win
with the refs on the payroll!

01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:52.268
Listen up.

01:17:52.268 --> 01:17:54.570
I got an idea to end
all this bullshit.

01:17:54.570 --> 01:17:57.040
INMATE:
Come on, let's all stay up!
Come on!

01:17:58.875 --> 01:18:00.710
Down, set!

01:18:00.710 --> 01:18:02.145
Red 58.

01:18:02.145 --> 01:18:03.579
Cover your man!

01:18:03.579 --> 01:18:06.916
Red 58. Hut!

01:18:10.186 --> 01:18:11.554
( groans )

01:18:11.554 --> 01:18:14.323
ALL:
Oooooh!

01:18:14.323 --> 01:18:16.125
Oh, ho, ho...

01:18:16.125 --> 01:18:17.126
Oh!

01:18:17.126 --> 01:18:19.996
That one hurt my marble sack.

01:18:22.766 --> 01:18:24.300
NATE: All right!
You all right?

01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:25.501
Yeah.

01:18:25.501 --> 01:18:26.903
What down is it?
Fifth.

01:18:26.903 --> 01:18:28.471
No, no.
It would be fourth down.

01:18:28.471 --> 01:18:30.173
Okay.

01:18:32.508 --> 01:18:34.410
What do you think?

01:18:34.410 --> 01:18:36.679
Should I go
for the left nut this time?

01:18:36.679 --> 01:18:39.148
LAMBERT:
Underneath! Let's go!

01:18:39.148 --> 01:18:40.683
Ref, you gotta
get in the game!

01:18:40.683 --> 01:18:42.051
Right over here!

01:18:42.051 --> 01:18:43.719
BERMAN:
Well, I don't quite get this,

01:18:43.719 --> 01:18:45.889
but on fourth and 22,
the cons are gonna go for it.

01:18:45.889 --> 01:18:47.590
( laughing ):
Down, set!

01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:49.225
Red 58.

01:18:49.225 --> 01:18:52.195
Red 58. Hut!

01:18:55.698 --> 01:18:58.567
( crowd gasps, whistle blows )

01:18:58.567 --> 01:19:00.003
Oh!

01:19:00.003 --> 01:19:02.738
You gotta always
protect the McNuggets.

01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:06.009
( inmates laughing )

01:19:06.009 --> 01:19:07.743
How 'bout from now on
you call a fair game?

01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:08.945
How's that sound?

01:19:08.945 --> 01:19:10.446
( weakly ):
Sounds good.

01:19:10.446 --> 01:19:12.548
Okay. Wet Willie.

01:19:12.548 --> 01:19:13.783
( giggling )

01:19:13.783 --> 01:19:15.919
Yeah, you like that.
Oh! Oh!

01:19:15.919 --> 01:19:19.055
* Voulez, voulez *

01:19:19.055 --> 01:19:21.157
BERMAN:
And so the guards
will take over

01:19:21.157 --> 01:19:23.059
after one of the strangest
offensive series

01:19:23.059 --> 01:19:24.760
I've ever seen.

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:27.964
Okay, boys. We know who doesn't
have any balls out there now.

01:19:27.964 --> 01:19:29.498
Have we got any?

01:19:29.498 --> 01:19:31.000
Have we got some balls?

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.802
Yeah!
Yeah!

01:19:32.802 --> 01:19:35.004
All right!
Let's go kick some ass!

01:19:35.004 --> 01:19:36.639
Come on, Swit,
stand 'em up, baby.

01:19:36.639 --> 01:19:37.841
( chuckling )

01:19:37.841 --> 01:19:39.142
White 50.

01:19:39.142 --> 01:19:41.878
White 50.
Hut, hut, hut!

01:19:41.878 --> 01:19:43.179
BERMAN:
Knauer, play action.

01:19:43.179 --> 01:19:45.714
Here comes the blitz.

01:19:45.714 --> 01:19:47.050
Ouch!

01:19:47.050 --> 01:19:48.784
Switowski is so big,

01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:50.987
it's like being tackled
by a Coke machine with legs.

01:19:50.987 --> 01:19:53.489
This is fun!

01:19:53.489 --> 01:19:54.690
( laughs )

01:19:54.690 --> 01:19:56.759
Nice to see ya
smiling, Bob.

01:19:56.759 --> 01:20:00.096
Thanks, Chris.

01:20:00.930 --> 01:20:02.631
Green 90! Hut!

01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:04.868
BERMAN:
Third and 5,
and the give is to Megget.

01:20:04.868 --> 01:20:07.203
He's to the 40,
where he'll come up short.

01:20:07.203 --> 01:20:09.672
But look at Turley
push the pile.

01:20:09.672 --> 01:20:12.075
And now Crewe.

01:20:13.209 --> 01:20:15.544
And that's
a first down!

01:20:15.544 --> 01:20:17.180
And look out.
Boy, somebody better

01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:18.882
take control of this game
soon,

01:20:18.882 --> 01:20:21.384
or they're gonna need body bags
on the sidelines.

01:20:21.384 --> 01:20:22.451
Let's go, guys.

01:20:22.451 --> 01:20:24.053
Come on.
Start of the second quarter.

01:20:24.053 --> 01:20:25.454
Cons still down
by two touchdowns,

01:20:25.454 --> 01:20:27.423
but they finally have
some momentum.

01:20:27.423 --> 01:20:28.892
Hut!

01:20:28.892 --> 01:20:31.127
( shrieking )

01:20:31.127 --> 01:20:33.396
Crewe with a shovel pass
to Megget.

01:20:33.396 --> 01:20:36.632
And Megget scrambles
for a first down.

01:20:36.632 --> 01:20:37.967
Oh, you fooled me.

01:20:37.967 --> 01:20:39.168
I got ya there,
didn't I?

01:20:39.168 --> 01:20:40.803
You did.
You know what, Engleheart?

01:20:40.803 --> 01:20:43.439
You are the best-lookin' guy
on your team. No kiddin'.

01:20:43.439 --> 01:20:45.308
You know, Paul,
in the midst of all this,

01:20:45.308 --> 01:20:47.310
for you to say
somethin' like that is...

01:20:47.310 --> 01:20:49.045
( sobs )

01:20:49.045 --> 01:20:50.446
Come on, let's go.
Let's go, D.

01:20:50.446 --> 01:20:52.281
BERMAN:
First and 10 at the guard's 35.

01:20:52.281 --> 01:20:55.784
Crewe dumps it over the middle
to Deacon Moss.

01:20:55.784 --> 01:20:59.188
And he's hammered at the 17
for a 13-yard pickup,

01:20:59.188 --> 01:21:01.257
and that's a first down.

01:21:01.257 --> 01:21:02.926
Hut!

01:21:02.926 --> 01:21:05.929
BERMAN:
Crewe, tryin' to get his team
on the scoreboard.

01:21:05.929 --> 01:21:08.164
He will throw.

01:21:09.665 --> 01:21:12.768
And it's caught by Deacon Moss
for a touchdown!

01:21:12.768 --> 01:21:14.837
( cheering )
All right!

01:21:14.837 --> 01:21:17.406
BERMAN:
And so there'll be
no shutout today,

01:21:17.406 --> 01:21:19.175
as the cons are on the board.

01:21:19.175 --> 01:21:21.110
( booing )
Quit booing, people.

01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:23.046
Both teams are trying
very hard!

01:21:23.046 --> 01:21:25.048
What the hell's wrong with you?

01:21:25.048 --> 01:21:26.815
Stop actin'
like a damn cheerleader!

01:21:26.815 --> 01:21:28.251
Sportsmanship, try it.

01:21:28.251 --> 01:21:31.320
Shut up.

01:21:32.555 --> 01:21:34.123
Damn.

01:21:34.123 --> 01:21:35.558
BERMAN:
2:11 left
in the first half.

01:21:35.558 --> 01:21:37.393
And Dunham is back in
at fullback.

01:21:37.393 --> 01:21:40.663
And he is a load, at 6'2", 260.

01:21:42.898 --> 01:21:44.300
Dunham, breaking tackles.

01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:46.802
He refuses to go down.

01:21:46.802 --> 01:21:52.408
But he finally does
after a 15-yard gain.

01:21:52.408 --> 01:21:55.178
That's how a white man
runs a football.

01:21:55.178 --> 01:21:56.479
If I was on D,
I'd crack you

01:21:56.479 --> 01:21:58.281
square in that egg-ass
head of yours.

01:21:58.281 --> 01:22:01.084
Yeah, but you ain't on D.
Are ya, bitch?

01:22:02.418 --> 01:22:03.752
Switowski!

01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:05.188
Come here.

01:22:05.188 --> 01:22:07.656
Do you know what he said to me
in the library?

01:22:10.726 --> 01:22:11.961
Yes.

01:22:11.961 --> 01:22:14.130
Him. Out.

01:22:14.130 --> 01:22:16.232
( growls )

01:22:17.366 --> 01:22:20.303
D, D, defense
D, D, defense

01:22:20.303 --> 01:22:22.771
BERMAN:
The cons don't seem to have
an answer for Dunham,

01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:25.808
who's averaging close
to 12 yards a carry this half.

01:22:25.808 --> 01:22:28.311
( growling )

01:22:28.311 --> 01:22:29.612
Green 67.

01:22:29.612 --> 01:22:31.314
Green 67. Hut!

01:22:35.051 --> 01:22:39.355
BERMAN:
Oh, what a hit on Dunham
by Switowski.

01:22:39.355 --> 01:22:41.157
( sniffing )

01:22:41.157 --> 01:22:43.659
I think I made him
shit himself.

01:22:43.659 --> 01:22:46.029
Ooh, shit!
I think he just shit himself.

01:22:46.029 --> 01:22:48.497
ALL:
I think he just shit himself.

01:22:48.497 --> 01:22:51.700
Good lord.
This guy shit himself bigtime.

01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:53.036
Ha, ha. See?

01:22:53.036 --> 01:22:56.172
I told you I made him
shit himself!

01:22:56.172 --> 01:22:57.740
MEGGET: Yo!

01:22:57.740 --> 01:23:00.009
I'll make sure I send them books
to the hospital, pimp.

01:23:00.009 --> 01:23:01.510
And some diapers.

01:23:02.945 --> 01:23:04.280
Nineteen seconds.

01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:05.881
We got a lotta ground to cover.

01:23:05.881 --> 01:23:07.116
So you bastards remember

01:23:07.116 --> 01:23:08.384
that play we practiced
in the mud?

01:23:08.384 --> 01:23:09.818
What're you
talkin' about?

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:11.287
That was some
schoolyard bullshit.

01:23:11.287 --> 01:23:14.623
Yeah. Let's try some
schoolyard bullshit.

01:23:16.259 --> 01:23:17.893
Come on, D, let's go.

01:23:17.893 --> 01:23:19.162
Down, set!

01:23:19.162 --> 01:23:20.996
Green 88.

01:23:20.996 --> 01:23:22.631
Green 88. Hut!

01:23:22.631 --> 01:23:24.433
BERMAN:
The clock starts to run.

01:23:24.433 --> 01:23:27.470
Crewe hands the ball to Megget.
It's a reverse.

01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:30.005
Cheeseburger Eddy's got it.

01:23:30.005 --> 01:23:31.674
PAUL: Go, baby, go!

01:23:31.674 --> 01:23:32.875
Whoop!

01:23:32.875 --> 01:23:35.611
He laterals to Deacon.

01:23:35.611 --> 01:23:38.013
Tackle him!

01:23:38.013 --> 01:23:39.448
Whoop! To Turley.

01:23:39.448 --> 01:23:41.717
The clock is running.

01:23:41.717 --> 01:23:43.319
Whoop! To Brucie.

01:23:43.319 --> 01:23:46.689
Shades of Cal-Stanford.
Back to Crewe.

01:23:46.689 --> 01:23:48.857
Whoop!
He tosses to Megget.

01:23:48.857 --> 01:23:50.059
Tackle him!

01:23:50.059 --> 01:23:52.828
Whoop!

01:23:52.828 --> 01:23:56.832
And look
at that little Megget run.

01:23:56.832 --> 01:23:59.802
Three seconds left.

01:23:59.802 --> 01:24:01.937
Yeah! Go!

01:24:01.937 --> 01:24:06.242
He could go all the way.

01:24:06.242 --> 01:24:08.211
Touchdown!

01:24:08.211 --> 01:24:09.812
( cheering )

01:24:13.949 --> 01:24:15.484
Do that sound again.

01:24:15.484 --> 01:24:16.852
Whoop!

01:24:16.852 --> 01:24:18.854
I like that.

01:24:18.854 --> 01:24:21.224
( whistle blows )

01:24:21.224 --> 01:24:23.859
And so, on a miraculous play,

01:24:23.859 --> 01:24:28.264
the cons end the first half
with a score 14-all.

01:24:28.264 --> 01:24:29.732
( booing )

01:24:32.968 --> 01:24:35.571
Bring it in.

01:24:35.571 --> 01:24:39.142
Do you have any idea
who's beating you out there?

01:24:39.142 --> 01:24:41.210
This was supposed to be
a blowout,

01:24:41.210 --> 01:24:45.681
and they're showin' you up
in front of the whole nation.

01:24:45.681 --> 01:24:47.950
The whole nation!

01:24:47.950 --> 01:24:50.353
I like it
when he's angry.

01:24:52.688 --> 01:24:54.723
I told you!
Way to go, baby, way to go.

01:24:54.723 --> 01:24:56.859
( clears throat )

01:25:01.564 --> 01:25:04.433
What in the hell do you think
you're doin' out there?

01:25:04.433 --> 01:25:07.336
Playin' football, sir.

01:25:07.336 --> 01:25:10.072
I didn't say nothin'
about winnin'.

01:25:10.072 --> 01:25:11.507
We're not winnin'.

01:25:11.507 --> 01:25:12.708
Not yet.

01:25:14.910 --> 01:25:16.312
You got yourself

01:25:16.312 --> 01:25:17.980
in quite a predicament,
Mr. Crewe.

01:25:17.980 --> 01:25:19.248
Is that right?

01:25:19.248 --> 01:25:20.683
You see, it's just come
to my attention

01:25:20.683 --> 01:25:23.018
that inmate Unger
has been taken into custody

01:25:23.018 --> 01:25:24.653
for the murder of Caretaker.

01:25:24.653 --> 01:25:27.323
Good.
Oh, yeah, it's good.

01:25:27.323 --> 01:25:30.893
Only thing is,
he claims to have an accomplice.

01:25:30.893 --> 01:25:33.396
Claims you knew all about it.

01:25:33.396 --> 01:25:34.663
Hell, he even says

01:25:34.663 --> 01:25:36.865
you sent Caretaker
to your cell.

01:25:36.865 --> 01:25:38.901
Bullshit.

01:25:38.901 --> 01:25:40.303
Captain Knauer says

01:25:40.303 --> 01:25:43.372
he saw you plannin' it
with Unger.

01:25:43.372 --> 01:25:45.741
There's no way
that could hold up in court.

01:25:45.741 --> 01:25:46.942
Court?

01:25:46.942 --> 01:25:48.211
( laughs )

01:25:48.211 --> 01:25:49.745
Hell, boy,

01:25:49.745 --> 01:25:52.981
in Allenville,
I'm the judge, I'm the jury,

01:25:52.981 --> 01:25:57.420
and in your particular case,
I'm the executioner.

01:25:57.420 --> 01:25:59.355
What do you want?

01:25:59.355 --> 01:26:01.490
I want you to lose.

01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:03.926
I can't do that.
'Course you can.

01:26:03.926 --> 01:26:06.161
After all,
you've had plenty of practice.

01:26:06.161 --> 01:26:07.663
But the men.

01:26:07.663 --> 01:26:09.865
It's more important to them
than it is to you.

01:26:09.865 --> 01:26:12.668
Okay. Suit yourself.

01:26:12.668 --> 01:26:15.371
Spend the next 25 years
of your useless life

01:26:15.371 --> 01:26:16.905
in prison.

01:26:18.574 --> 01:26:21.210
All right, I'll do it.

01:26:24.313 --> 01:26:25.614
But I don't want
my guys hurt.

01:26:25.614 --> 01:26:28.584
You get ahead, you coast.
We clear?

01:26:28.584 --> 01:26:32.621
Fine. Right after I get
a two-touchdown lead.

01:26:32.621 --> 01:26:36.191
I tell you what bothers me
the most, warden.

01:26:37.693 --> 01:26:40.596
That you're not gonna be
out there on that field with us,

01:26:40.596 --> 01:26:42.931
gettin'
what you got comin' to ya.

01:26:45.568 --> 01:26:48.904
The only thing comin' to me
is victory.

01:26:50.773 --> 01:26:52.841
"Mean Machine."

01:26:52.841 --> 01:26:56.445
Heh. It's cute.

01:26:58.314 --> 01:26:59.548
Let's go, boy!

01:26:59.548 --> 01:27:02.451
We can do it, baby!
Captain.

01:27:02.451 --> 01:27:03.986
May I have a word?

01:27:03.986 --> 01:27:06.689
Don't worry, warden,
we'll take care of business.

01:27:06.689 --> 01:27:08.257
I already have.

01:27:08.257 --> 01:27:09.725
What?

01:27:09.725 --> 01:27:11.327
We can win this
on our own.

01:27:11.327 --> 01:27:13.529
Captain, a man
in my position

01:27:13.529 --> 01:27:15.531
doesn't leave things
to chance.

01:27:15.531 --> 01:27:19.435
Now, after you get a comfortable
three-touchdown lead...

01:27:19.435 --> 01:27:21.203
I want you to inflict
as much pain

01:27:21.203 --> 01:27:22.471
as humanly possible.

01:27:22.471 --> 01:27:24.873
Do not let up,
you hear?

01:27:24.873 --> 01:27:26.208
I want those cons

01:27:26.208 --> 01:27:28.311
to understand
who owns 'em.

01:27:28.311 --> 01:27:30.346
Do I make myself clear?

01:27:30.346 --> 01:27:31.947
Oh, yes, sir.

01:27:31.947 --> 01:27:33.549
Good.

01:27:33.549 --> 01:27:34.750
( crowd roaring )

01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:36.285
BERMAN:
There's the kickoff

01:27:36.285 --> 01:27:38.287
and we're underway
in the second half.

01:27:42.825 --> 01:27:44.226
( whistle blows )

01:27:44.226 --> 01:27:46.762
Megget is finally brought down
at the guards' 33,

01:27:46.762 --> 01:27:48.697
where Paul Crewe
will take over.

01:27:48.697 --> 01:27:50.633
And what a first half he's had.

01:27:50.633 --> 01:27:52.335
Here we go! Here we go!

01:27:55.070 --> 01:27:56.772
Down, set!

01:27:56.772 --> 01:27:59.575
Y 45. Hut!

01:27:59.575 --> 01:28:02.811
BERMAN:
On first and 10,
Crewe will pass.

01:28:02.811 --> 01:28:04.947
He's got Deacon wide open.

01:28:04.947 --> 01:28:06.248
Oh, incomplete.

01:28:06.248 --> 01:28:08.150
It's okay. Get your head up.

01:28:08.150 --> 01:28:10.886
It's all right, man.

01:28:10.886 --> 01:28:12.488
Come on, Paulie.

01:28:12.488 --> 01:28:13.956
Second and 10 from the 33.

01:28:13.956 --> 01:28:15.658
Crewe is looking for Deacon
once again.

01:28:15.658 --> 01:28:18.361
He's open!
He's open!

01:28:18.361 --> 01:28:20.463
But overthrows him.

01:28:20.463 --> 01:28:22.631
And it's picked off
by Papajohn.

01:28:22.631 --> 01:28:24.533
Look out! He might go.

01:28:25.934 --> 01:28:28.070
Say goodbye.

01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:29.405
Touchdown!

01:28:29.405 --> 01:28:31.974
( cheering )

01:28:31.974 --> 01:28:35.310
The first mistake
Crewe's made all day.

01:28:37.913 --> 01:28:39.615
Short memory, baby.

01:28:39.615 --> 01:28:41.784
We'll get it back.
We'll get it back.

01:28:41.784 --> 01:28:44.653
INMATE:
Defense!
Let's do this!

01:28:44.653 --> 01:28:46.389
BERMAN:
8:38 left in the third quarter

01:28:46.389 --> 01:28:48.791
and Crewe has struggled
thus far in the 2nd half.

01:28:48.791 --> 01:28:50.092
Hut!

01:28:50.092 --> 01:28:51.727
The pitch to Megget.

01:28:51.727 --> 01:28:54.329
Oh, my! That ball is live!

01:28:54.329 --> 01:28:56.264
It's picked up by Lambert.

01:28:56.264 --> 01:29:00.102
He's at the 15, the 10
and he will score!

01:29:00.102 --> 01:29:01.770
Yeah! Touchdown!

01:29:01.770 --> 01:29:03.406
Yeah!

01:29:03.406 --> 01:29:06.509
Crewe took a shot on that play
and he's getting up slowly.

01:29:06.509 --> 01:29:08.444
( inmates booing )

01:29:08.444 --> 01:29:09.878
Meanwhile, in the end zone,

01:29:09.878 --> 01:29:11.580
the guards have something
to celebrate

01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:13.549
as they find themselves
up by two touchdowns.

01:29:13.549 --> 01:29:16.051
This is simply
a different Paul Crewe

01:29:16.051 --> 01:29:17.953
we're seeing
here in the 2nd half.

01:29:17.953 --> 01:29:20.656
There's the old Paul Crewe
we love to write about.

01:29:20.656 --> 01:29:22.491
What the hell are ya
doin' out there?

01:29:22.491 --> 01:29:25.093
I'm done.

01:29:25.093 --> 01:29:27.362
I'm out. That's it.

01:29:29.264 --> 01:29:31.333
Where ya hurtin'?
My knee.

01:29:31.333 --> 01:29:33.669
Seems okay to me.
Well, it ain't.

01:29:35.671 --> 01:29:37.740
If Crewe can't go,

01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:40.108
I don't know how deep
these guys are at quarterback.

01:29:40.108 --> 01:29:41.744
( blows whistle )

01:29:41.744 --> 01:29:43.779
The guards'll try
to keep it away from Megget

01:29:43.779 --> 01:29:45.514
so they'll pooch kick.

01:29:45.514 --> 01:29:46.949
Fair catch. Fair catch.

01:29:46.949 --> 01:29:48.484
As Big Tony calls
for the fair catch.

01:29:48.484 --> 01:29:50.853
Oh! Watch out.

01:29:50.853 --> 01:29:54.089
That was as late a hit
as I've ever seen.

01:29:54.089 --> 01:29:55.491
( crowd booing )

01:29:55.491 --> 01:29:59.027
And even some of the home crowd
not liking that one.

01:29:59.027 --> 01:30:02.230
Hang in there, partner.
Can of corn.

01:30:02.230 --> 01:30:03.932
Can of corn and I'll be fine.

01:30:03.932 --> 01:30:06.068
Can of corn.

01:30:08.336 --> 01:30:10.338
Yeah, I'd have a hard time
lookin' at me too.

01:30:10.338 --> 01:30:12.107
NATE: Brucie.

01:30:12.107 --> 01:30:13.909
Yeah, coach.

01:30:13.909 --> 01:30:15.844
You're the only one
that knows this offense, son.

01:30:15.844 --> 01:30:18.013
Go do it.
BERMAN: Coming into the game,

01:30:18.013 --> 01:30:19.648
replacing the injured
Paul Crewe

01:30:19.648 --> 01:30:21.484
is number 1, Brucie.

01:30:21.484 --> 01:30:24.219
All right. Crewe's playin'
like shit. That's his problem.

01:30:24.219 --> 01:30:25.420
I'm gonna bring us back.

01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:27.389
Right, 32
Flex Dive Motion on one.

01:30:27.389 --> 01:30:28.924
Ready!
ALL: Break!

01:30:28.924 --> 01:30:30.125
Yeah.

01:30:30.125 --> 01:30:32.060
It's Brucie's time to shine,
baby.

01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:34.930
Okay. Down, set. Hut!

01:30:34.930 --> 01:30:36.799
There's the snap
and the ball is fumbled.

01:30:36.799 --> 01:30:39.001
And the guards recover.
Damn it.

01:30:39.001 --> 01:30:41.904
Ah! I knew I shouldn't have had
that popcorn.

01:30:41.904 --> 01:30:43.772
The guards are in command here

01:30:43.772 --> 01:30:46.074
as we move late
into the third quarter.

01:30:46.074 --> 01:30:47.543
Ninety-eight. Hut! Hut!

01:30:47.543 --> 01:30:49.978
The give is to Potter.

01:30:49.978 --> 01:30:51.614
Back to Knauer.

01:30:51.614 --> 01:30:53.849
He's got a man open
deep downfield.

01:30:53.849 --> 01:30:55.984
He'll throw the flea-flicker!

01:30:55.984 --> 01:30:58.987
And he's got it.
Touchdown, guards.

01:30:58.987 --> 01:31:02.891
And this game is starting
to look like a blowout.

01:31:04.092 --> 01:31:05.460
Hey, man,

01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:08.497
after all Caretaker did,
this is how you show him love?

01:31:08.497 --> 01:31:09.965
Don't worry about it.

01:31:09.965 --> 01:31:12.701
You haven't changed
one damn bit.

01:31:16.672 --> 01:31:18.240
All right. Down, set!

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:20.042
BERMAN:
Back in at quarterback
is Brucie,

01:31:20.042 --> 01:31:23.245
who will try to find
a handle on the ball this time.

01:31:24.312 --> 01:31:25.614
Throw it, Brucie!

01:31:25.614 --> 01:31:27.783
Aw, shit!

01:31:27.783 --> 01:31:30.953
And look out.

01:31:32.487 --> 01:31:35.524
Ooh! What a shot he took!

01:31:35.524 --> 01:31:37.192
How much more blood do you want?

01:31:39.628 --> 01:31:41.063
I think the cons

01:31:41.063 --> 01:31:45.701
are just about
out of options at quarterback.

01:31:47.502 --> 01:31:50.806
( poignant theme building )

01:32:02.918 --> 01:32:05.554
Hey, Skitchy,
let me ask you somethin'.

01:32:05.554 --> 01:32:08.056
When you popped
the warden,

01:32:08.056 --> 01:32:09.491
was it worth it?

01:32:09.491 --> 01:32:11.660
Was it worth spendin' the rest
of your life in here?

01:32:11.660 --> 01:32:13.729
Was it worth it?

01:32:13.729 --> 01:32:16.865
It was worth
every goddamn second.

01:32:23.939 --> 01:32:26.274
What the hell
is he doin'?

01:32:28.744 --> 01:32:30.512
Paul Crewe must be
feeling better,

01:32:30.512 --> 01:32:32.347
because here he comes.

01:32:32.347 --> 01:32:35.017
PAUL: All right,
I missed you guys, so I'm back.

01:32:35.017 --> 01:32:36.418
We got a lot
of work to do.

01:32:36.418 --> 01:32:37.620
Let's get it goin'.

01:32:37.620 --> 01:32:39.487
Deuce right, 89.
Fly on two.

01:32:39.487 --> 01:32:42.024
Ready?

01:32:42.024 --> 01:32:44.827
Break.

01:32:44.827 --> 01:32:48.430
BERMAN:
As we start the fourth quarter,
cons down by three touchdowns.

01:32:48.430 --> 01:32:50.298
Wide left!
Tight left!

01:32:51.499 --> 01:32:54.369
Black 90. Hut! Hut!

01:32:54.369 --> 01:32:56.905
Here comes the blitz
and no one's blocking!

01:32:56.905 --> 01:33:00.843
And Crewe will be sacked
for a big loss.

01:33:00.843 --> 01:33:02.444
That looked
like a message to Crewe

01:33:02.444 --> 01:33:05.614
from his offensive line.

01:33:05.614 --> 01:33:07.683
Did you see that, man?
They're quittin' on him.

01:33:07.683 --> 01:33:09.885
Okay, baby.
Jailbreak Blitz. Ready?

01:33:09.885 --> 01:33:11.353
We got that
outta the way.

01:33:11.353 --> 01:33:12.621
I deserved it.

01:33:12.621 --> 01:33:14.256
Now we gotta play
some football.

01:33:14.256 --> 01:33:16.158
Switch it! Switch it!

01:33:16.158 --> 01:33:18.093
Cons need to do something
to get back in this game.

01:33:18.093 --> 01:33:19.928
And that's not it!

01:33:19.928 --> 01:33:22.497
And Crewe is leveled!

01:33:22.497 --> 01:33:24.667
I don't think he's gonna get up
from that one.

01:33:24.667 --> 01:33:26.568
Nice hit!
( spits )

01:33:26.568 --> 01:33:29.071
( whistle blows )
But he is.

01:33:29.071 --> 01:33:30.806
And I don't know how,
after that last hit.

01:33:30.806 --> 01:33:32.207
All right, punt team!

01:33:32.207 --> 01:33:34.542
Keep them off the field!
We're goin' for it.

01:33:34.542 --> 01:33:36.544
Dumbshits are goin' for it!
Let's go! Let's go!

01:33:36.544 --> 01:33:38.781
Come on back. If he wants
to get his ass kicked.

01:33:38.781 --> 01:33:39.982
Come on back.

01:33:39.982 --> 01:33:41.784
BERMAN:
This is unbelievable.

01:33:41.784 --> 01:33:44.419
Fine. You guys don't wanna
help me, I'll do it on my own.

01:33:44.419 --> 01:33:46.321
On two.

01:33:46.321 --> 01:33:48.090
Let's go, to the line.

01:33:48.090 --> 01:33:51.827
On fourth and 20,
the cons are gonna go for it.

01:33:51.827 --> 01:33:53.495
This could be the ball game
right here.

01:33:53.495 --> 01:33:55.864
Red 98. Hut! Hut!

01:33:55.864 --> 01:33:58.834
Crewe dodges the blitz.

01:33:58.834 --> 01:34:00.903
But he loses his helmet.

01:34:03.605 --> 01:34:05.307
And he's not going down.

01:34:10.713 --> 01:34:13.048
He's got the first down.

01:34:13.048 --> 01:34:15.050
Time-out!
( blows whistle )

01:34:15.050 --> 01:34:17.052
Man, oh, man.
Not bad.

01:34:24.226 --> 01:34:26.161
Huddle up.

01:34:26.161 --> 01:34:27.896
Look.

01:34:27.896 --> 01:34:30.098
I'm sure you already
know this,

01:34:30.098 --> 01:34:33.001
but I never
said it out loud.

01:34:33.001 --> 01:34:35.637
I did throw that game.

01:34:35.637 --> 01:34:36.839
( inmates murmuring )

01:34:36.839 --> 01:34:39.074
I did it.

01:34:39.074 --> 01:34:42.577
I was in a bad way
with some worse people.

01:34:42.577 --> 01:34:44.179
After I did it...

01:34:44.179 --> 01:34:45.447
I felt so shitty

01:34:45.447 --> 01:34:48.516
I wish I would have just
let them kill me instead.

01:34:48.516 --> 01:34:50.418
Now,

01:34:50.418 --> 01:34:53.555
the warden wants to pin
Caretaker's murder on me

01:34:53.555 --> 01:34:55.824
if I don't
throw this game.

01:34:56.925 --> 01:34:58.260
So it looks like I'm gonna

01:34:58.260 --> 01:35:00.128
get to know you guys
a lot better,

01:35:00.128 --> 01:35:03.265
'cause I ain't doin' that
twice in a lifetime.

01:35:03.265 --> 01:35:05.834
We got a little time left.
We can still do this.

01:35:05.834 --> 01:35:07.035
I'm beggin' ya.

01:35:07.035 --> 01:35:10.005
Put your hands in here.

01:35:18.781 --> 01:35:21.383
Okay. Thank you.

01:35:21.383 --> 01:35:23.651
Now, who are we?
ALL: Mean Machine!

01:35:23.651 --> 01:35:26.755
Come on, Mean Machine,
let's go!

01:35:29.124 --> 01:35:30.759
That's great news.

01:35:30.759 --> 01:35:32.494
All right.

01:35:32.494 --> 01:35:33.695
We got ourselves a game.

01:35:33.695 --> 01:35:35.163
Brown 65. Hut!

01:35:35.163 --> 01:35:37.332
First and 10 from the 30.

01:35:37.332 --> 01:35:39.467
Crewe finds Deacon
open in the flat.

01:35:39.467 --> 01:35:41.736
( AC/DC's "If You Want Blood
(You've Got It)" playing )

01:35:41.736 --> 01:35:44.472
Hut!

01:35:44.472 --> 01:35:45.974
The give is to Megget.

01:35:45.974 --> 01:35:47.575
And he fights his way
for a 9-yard gain.

01:35:47.575 --> 01:35:50.545
One yard, baby.
One more yard.

01:35:50.545 --> 01:35:51.746
Hut! Hut!

01:35:51.746 --> 01:35:53.882
Crewe tries a sneak. Or is it?

01:35:53.882 --> 01:35:55.450
He flips it back to Megget.

01:35:55.450 --> 01:35:59.521
Megget's got the first down
and more.

01:35:59.521 --> 01:36:03.358
* There ought to be
A whole lot more *

01:36:03.358 --> 01:36:05.727
* You get nothin' for nothin' *

01:36:05.727 --> 01:36:09.164
BERMAN:
And Megget is down
to the 4-yard line,

01:36:09.164 --> 01:36:11.199
where it'll be first and goal.

01:36:11.199 --> 01:36:12.700
Hut!

01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:14.569
Crewe hands it to Turley.

01:36:14.569 --> 01:36:16.538
And look at the big man go.

01:36:16.538 --> 01:36:17.873
Tackle him!

01:36:17.873 --> 01:36:19.474
( bellowing )

01:36:19.474 --> 01:36:22.310
* You got it *

01:36:23.211 --> 01:36:24.712
BERMAN:
Touchdown!

01:36:24.712 --> 01:36:26.648
( cheering )

01:36:26.648 --> 01:36:28.817
That was some rumblin',
bumblin', stumblin'

01:36:28.817 --> 01:36:30.018
right there.

01:36:30.018 --> 01:36:31.820
And listen to the crowd,

01:36:31.820 --> 01:36:35.657
as this underdog con team
is starting to win them over.

01:36:35.657 --> 01:36:41.696
( Kool Keith's "Break U Off"
playing )

01:36:41.696 --> 01:36:43.565
( blows whistle )

01:36:43.565 --> 01:36:45.133
Third down and 6.

01:36:45.133 --> 01:36:47.469
Guards have the ball
on their own 29-yard line.

01:36:47.469 --> 01:36:49.571
Knauer needs a first down
to put this game away.

01:36:49.571 --> 01:36:53.608
White 50!
White 50!

01:36:53.608 --> 01:36:56.011
And look at Battle take off.

01:36:57.112 --> 01:36:58.613
He knocks the ball loose!

01:36:58.613 --> 01:37:01.716
There's a dogpile
in the backfield.

01:37:01.716 --> 01:37:04.419
The refs are tryin'
to sort it out.

01:37:05.854 --> 01:37:07.289
( flesh sears )

01:37:07.289 --> 01:37:09.557
Ow! My arm!

01:37:09.557 --> 01:37:10.758
The cons recover!

01:37:10.758 --> 01:37:12.327
( cheering )

01:37:12.327 --> 01:37:14.129
We got the ball!
We got the ball!

01:37:14.129 --> 01:37:15.830
We got it!
We got it!

01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:18.233
With just over two minutes
left to be played,

01:37:18.233 --> 01:37:20.502
this has turned
into a game.

01:37:20.502 --> 01:37:22.570
Crewe will start
in great field position

01:37:22.570 --> 01:37:23.771
at the guards' 25.

01:37:23.771 --> 01:37:25.840
And look at this formation!

01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:28.443
The guards, they're confused.

01:37:28.443 --> 01:37:29.677
Shift over! Move!

01:37:29.677 --> 01:37:31.146
They're tryin' to call
time-out.

01:37:31.146 --> 01:37:33.248
But there's the snap.

01:37:36.018 --> 01:37:37.652
Moss is behind a wall of cons.

01:37:37.652 --> 01:37:39.922
I wouldn't wanna be
in front of that thing.

01:37:42.891 --> 01:37:44.459
And they'll score!

01:37:44.459 --> 01:37:47.629
( cheering )

01:37:49.497 --> 01:37:51.233
Hey! Is that legal?

01:37:51.233 --> 01:37:53.168
Yeah, it is.
Is that a touchdown?

01:37:53.168 --> 01:37:55.770
Yes, it is.
What is going on here?

01:37:55.770 --> 01:37:57.172
Shit!

01:37:57.172 --> 01:37:58.873
BERMAN:
And with the extra point,

01:37:58.873 --> 01:38:00.976
the cons are down
by just seven.

01:38:00.976 --> 01:38:03.545
( energetic drum beat playing )

01:38:07.749 --> 01:38:09.051
Brucie!

01:38:09.051 --> 01:38:10.352
Yeah, coach.

01:38:10.352 --> 01:38:12.320
I want you
to go out there

01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:13.521
and kick off.

01:38:13.521 --> 01:38:15.490
I can do it.
Kick off!

01:38:15.490 --> 01:38:17.192
Brucie can't kick
worth a shit.

01:38:17.192 --> 01:38:20.895
I know. Recover the ball.

01:38:20.895 --> 01:38:22.330
Jesus Christ, my savior.

01:38:22.330 --> 01:38:23.698
If ya help me out
with this one,

01:38:23.698 --> 01:38:25.533
I promise to stop
cheating on my wife

01:38:25.533 --> 01:38:27.302
with black guys. Amen.

01:38:27.302 --> 01:38:29.972
BERMAN:
Back in the game is Brucie,
and he'll do the honors.

01:38:29.972 --> 01:38:31.839
And it's a horrible kick.

01:38:31.839 --> 01:38:34.276
But the ball is tipped!

01:38:34.276 --> 01:38:35.843
And the cons
have come up with it!

01:38:35.843 --> 01:38:37.980
( cheering )

01:38:37.980 --> 01:38:39.481
We got it! One time-out.

01:38:39.481 --> 01:38:40.682
Got it. Got it.

01:38:40.682 --> 01:38:42.450
That's it, Brucie.
Oh!

01:38:42.450 --> 01:38:44.352
Hey, hey!
My bad. My bad. My bad. Come on.

01:38:45.587 --> 01:38:48.991
Gimme that.
Damn--

01:38:50.325 --> 01:38:52.794
Well, that felt
unnecessary.

01:38:52.794 --> 01:38:54.929
Cons have enough time
for one final drive.

01:38:54.929 --> 01:38:56.598
( blows whistle )

01:38:56.598 --> 01:38:59.167
Crewe drops back to pass.
He's under pressure.

01:38:59.167 --> 01:39:00.368
Watch the pass!

01:39:00.368 --> 01:39:02.170
He's looking for Deacon.

01:39:02.170 --> 01:39:04.772
He gets the ball up,
but he's leveled.

01:39:04.772 --> 01:39:06.641
And Deacon's got it
for a first down,

01:39:06.641 --> 01:39:07.942
but he stayed inbounds.

01:39:07.942 --> 01:39:09.877
Tick, tick, tick.
The clock keeps running.

01:39:09.877 --> 01:39:11.413
NATE: Clock's running.

01:39:11.413 --> 01:39:13.515
Clock's still running!
Clock's still running!

01:39:13.515 --> 01:39:14.716
On the ball!

01:39:14.716 --> 01:39:16.718
Goddamn it!
Do something!

01:39:16.718 --> 01:39:18.453
Hut!

01:39:18.453 --> 01:39:21.923
Crewe. He's looking to throw.
Under pressure again.

01:39:21.923 --> 01:39:24.459
Go! Get rid of it! Now! Now!

01:39:24.459 --> 01:39:26.028
He pitches it to Megget.

01:39:26.028 --> 01:39:27.295
He's got some room.

01:39:27.295 --> 01:39:28.696
Here we go.
Here we go.

01:39:28.696 --> 01:39:31.433
Go, Megg! Go, Megget!

01:39:31.433 --> 01:39:32.867
Get him!

01:39:32.867 --> 01:39:34.836
He could go all the way!

01:39:34.836 --> 01:39:36.671
But he won't!

01:39:36.671 --> 01:39:38.006
Goddamn it!

01:39:38.006 --> 01:39:40.508
And Megget is hit hard at the 4
and he's hurt.

01:39:40.508 --> 01:39:42.477
My knee, man!

01:39:44.446 --> 01:39:45.647
You busted your knee
for us,

01:39:45.647 --> 01:39:47.149
we'll bust our ass
for you.

01:39:47.149 --> 01:39:48.983
Hey, coach, I need a back!

01:39:48.983 --> 01:39:51.219
Just win this shit.

01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:54.022
I'm goin' in.

01:39:54.022 --> 01:39:55.723
Coach, you serious?

01:39:55.723 --> 01:39:57.825
Yeah, I'm serious.

01:39:57.825 --> 01:40:00.828
And look who's
coming into the game.

01:40:00.828 --> 01:40:02.697
You can do it!

01:40:02.697 --> 01:40:06.334
Get that old ass of yours
in the end zone!

01:40:06.334 --> 01:40:09.171
We gotta win this thing!
Come on!

01:40:09.171 --> 01:40:11.439
( crowd cheering )

01:40:11.439 --> 01:40:13.241
No, no, no, no.
Hey. Old man.

01:40:13.241 --> 01:40:14.576
Absolutely not.

01:40:14.576 --> 01:40:16.044
You're gonna get
killed out here.

01:40:16.044 --> 01:40:17.379
They've been tryin' that
for years.

01:40:17.379 --> 01:40:18.980
Don't worry,
I got the perfect play.

01:40:18.980 --> 01:40:21.249
I ain't handin' you the ball.
You don't have to.

01:40:21.249 --> 01:40:24.186
BERMAN:
Nate Scarborough, the former
Heisman Trophy winner

01:40:24.186 --> 01:40:25.653
from 1955,
is gonna play tailback,

01:40:25.653 --> 01:40:27.489
but he's gotta be in there

01:40:27.489 --> 01:40:29.157
more for moral support
than anything.

01:40:29.157 --> 01:40:30.358
BABY FACE BOB:
Mean Machine.

01:40:30.358 --> 01:40:33.595
Mean Machine.
Mean Machine.

01:40:33.595 --> 01:40:35.063
Mean Machine.

01:40:35.063 --> 01:40:38.333
SPECTATORS ( chanting ):
Mean Machine
Mean Machine

01:40:38.333 --> 01:40:41.403
Mean Machine
Mean Machine.

01:40:41.403 --> 01:40:43.605
Mean Machine
Mean Machine

01:40:43.605 --> 01:40:46.308
BERMAN:
Six seconds left on the clock.
Cons down by seven.

01:40:46.308 --> 01:40:48.676
They must score on this play.

01:40:50.978 --> 01:40:52.480
Don't let them through!

01:40:54.216 --> 01:40:56.118
PAUL: Down, set!

01:40:56.118 --> 01:40:57.952
Black 99!

01:40:57.952 --> 01:40:59.154
Come on, D!

01:40:59.154 --> 01:41:01.022
PAUL:
Black 99! Hut!

01:41:01.022 --> 01:41:02.557
Hut!

01:41:02.557 --> 01:41:04.392
BERMAN:
The give is to the big man,
Turley.

01:41:04.392 --> 01:41:07.028
He's stopped by Lambert
at the line

01:41:07.028 --> 01:41:08.630
for no gain.

01:41:08.630 --> 01:41:11.966
No! Wait!

01:41:11.966 --> 01:41:14.836
The ball's picked up
by Scarborough.

01:41:17.405 --> 01:41:19.541
Come on!

01:41:23.711 --> 01:41:26.748
Touchdown!

01:41:34.522 --> 01:41:37.525
What an amazing comeback,
folks!

01:41:37.525 --> 01:41:39.361
Taking a play
from the old Nebraska playbook.

01:41:39.361 --> 01:41:40.762
The Fumblerooskie.

01:41:40.762 --> 01:41:42.397
PAUL: Easy. Easy.

01:41:42.397 --> 01:41:44.266
You still alive, old man?

01:41:45.533 --> 01:41:46.801
Never felt better in my life.

01:41:46.801 --> 01:41:49.571
You're a sick bastard.
Come here.

01:41:49.571 --> 01:41:51.673
All right.

01:41:51.673 --> 01:41:53.908
And now the cons
are a mere extra point

01:41:53.908 --> 01:41:56.077
away from overtime.

01:41:56.077 --> 01:41:59.447
Mean Machine!

01:42:01.183 --> 01:42:02.450
Team vote.

01:42:02.450 --> 01:42:04.652
We go for the win.
We go for the tie.

01:42:04.652 --> 01:42:07.422
Hell, guys, we're convicts.
We always go for it all.

01:42:07.422 --> 01:42:08.856
( inmates laughing )

01:42:08.856 --> 01:42:10.292
Unfortunately,

01:42:10.292 --> 01:42:12.960
that's why
we're all in the joint.

01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:14.429
What would Caretaker do?

01:42:15.530 --> 01:42:17.332
Gimme that blackboard.

01:42:17.332 --> 01:42:18.866
Yeah, come on!

01:42:18.866 --> 01:42:20.802
Come on.

01:42:22.304 --> 01:42:24.239
Are you serious?

01:42:24.239 --> 01:42:26.073
I don't know.
That play is wack.

01:42:26.073 --> 01:42:27.842
It's gonna work.

01:42:27.842 --> 01:42:29.244
It's gonna work.

01:42:29.244 --> 01:42:30.878
Let's go. On the ball.

01:42:30.878 --> 01:42:32.113
Come on! Let's go!

01:42:32.113 --> 01:42:34.316
Let's go, y'all!
Let's go!

01:42:34.316 --> 01:42:36.751
I think it's gonna work.

01:42:36.751 --> 01:42:39.187
Get them out there.

01:42:40.722 --> 01:42:42.290
BERMAN:
And wait a minute.

01:42:42.290 --> 01:42:44.526
Crewe is coming
back into the game.

01:42:44.526 --> 01:42:46.461
The cons are gonna go
for the win.

01:42:46.461 --> 01:42:48.696
They're goin' for it.

01:42:48.696 --> 01:42:51.999
Crewe, trying to
settle his team into formation.

01:42:51.999 --> 01:42:54.236
But there seems to be
a lot of confusion.

01:42:54.236 --> 01:42:56.204
Come on! Run the play!

01:42:56.204 --> 01:42:58.640
Turley! Turley.
Over here.

01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:01.443
Move your giant ass right here!
Right here.

01:43:01.443 --> 01:43:04.612
Come on, baby. Come on.

01:43:04.612 --> 01:43:06.748
BERMAN:
The play clock
is still running.

01:43:06.748 --> 01:43:08.182
Crewe better call a time-out.

01:43:08.182 --> 01:43:10.985
Come on, Crewe!

01:43:10.985 --> 01:43:13.154
They don't know
what we're doin'!

01:43:13.154 --> 01:43:14.822
Run the play we set up.

01:43:14.822 --> 01:43:17.892
I think you're still dizzy
from that hit!

01:43:17.892 --> 01:43:20.328
The snap is to Deacon.

01:43:20.328 --> 01:43:22.497
It's a trick.

01:43:22.497 --> 01:43:24.932
He throws it to Crewe.

01:43:24.932 --> 01:43:26.801
( triumphant orchestral theme
playing )

01:43:46.087 --> 01:43:47.589
( crowd roars )

01:43:47.589 --> 01:43:49.924
They did it! Unbelievable!

01:43:49.924 --> 01:43:51.626
The cons win.

01:44:04.972 --> 01:44:06.374
We win!

01:44:06.374 --> 01:44:08.976
Group hug in the shower tonight!

01:44:08.976 --> 01:44:11.245
( cheering silences )

01:44:11.245 --> 01:44:13.915
Or not. Or not.

01:44:16.284 --> 01:44:17.519
BERMAN:
Well, there you have it.

01:44:17.519 --> 01:44:19.120
A bunch of ruthless criminals

01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:22.357
have beaten the men
that uphold our justice system.

01:44:22.357 --> 01:44:24.492
Criminals are
people too, Chris.

01:44:24.492 --> 01:44:26.127
Now, gimme your wallet.

01:44:26.127 --> 01:44:27.795
What?

01:44:27.795 --> 01:44:31.032
Just kidding.

01:44:33.368 --> 01:44:35.337
You got a lot of balls, Crewe.

01:44:35.337 --> 01:44:37.138
You played
a hell of a game.

01:44:37.138 --> 01:44:38.706
And don't worry,

01:44:38.706 --> 01:44:41.343
I know you had nothin' to do
with Caretaker's murder.

01:44:41.343 --> 01:44:43.044
And I'll back that up.

01:44:44.512 --> 01:44:47.482
Thank you, baby.

01:44:47.482 --> 01:44:50.418
INMATES ( chanting ):
Mean Machine!
Mean Machine!

01:44:50.418 --> 01:44:53.254
( chanting continues )

01:44:53.254 --> 01:44:55.056
You humiliated me.

01:44:55.056 --> 01:44:59.761
I can't believe you couldn't
even win a fixed game.

01:44:59.761 --> 01:45:03.297
HAZEN:
Now, where the hell
does he think he's goin'?

01:45:06.267 --> 01:45:07.702
He's escapin'.

01:45:07.702 --> 01:45:09.337
He's escapin'.

01:45:09.337 --> 01:45:11.573
Officer,
shoot that man!

01:45:11.573 --> 01:45:14.409
But, sir, there's people.

01:45:14.409 --> 01:45:16.444
Shoot him.

01:45:16.444 --> 01:45:18.413
Crewe!

01:45:18.413 --> 01:45:19.714
Captain,

01:45:19.714 --> 01:45:21.816
I order you
to shoot that prisoner.

01:45:24.519 --> 01:45:27.154
Shoot him! Fire!

01:45:27.154 --> 01:45:28.556
Crewe!

01:45:28.556 --> 01:45:31.693
Damn it, I'm giving you
an order, captain!

01:45:31.693 --> 01:45:34.929
Crewe!
Pull the trigger!

01:45:51.145 --> 01:45:53.014
( panting )

01:45:53.014 --> 01:45:57.519
It's the game ball.

01:46:02.424 --> 01:46:05.493
Hey.

01:46:08.129 --> 01:46:11.566
Why don't you stick this
in your trophy case.

01:46:13.334 --> 01:46:15.002
You have a nice time,
old man?

01:46:15.002 --> 01:46:16.438
Yeah.
Yeah?

01:46:16.438 --> 01:46:18.473
Okay.
So, what do we do now?

01:46:18.473 --> 01:46:19.807
Well,
the first thing is,

01:46:19.807 --> 01:46:21.843
we tell the team
where they're hiding Unger.

01:46:21.843 --> 01:46:24.479
Oh, I can't wait to see
what Switowski does to him.

01:46:24.479 --> 01:46:26.080
( laughs )

01:46:31.018 --> 01:46:33.387
Great game, sir.

01:46:33.387 --> 01:46:36.190
( both laughing )

01:46:36.190 --> 01:46:38.125
That's a week in the hotbox!

01:46:38.125 --> 01:46:40.127

Who gives a shit!

* Boom! When I'm coming like...
Boom! When I'm coming like... *

01:46:56.310 --> 01:46:59.647
* Boom! When I'm coming for you
It's gonna sound like... *

to every young brother,

out of that joint.

More than that *

* For them to break my soul *
