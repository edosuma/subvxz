01:12.489 --> 01:16.268
Five, six, seven, eight...

01:16.368 --> 01:18.911
nine, 10.

01:58.911 --> 02:02.121
I always know where I am
by the way the road looks.

02:07.544 --> 02:09.947
Like I just know
that I've been here before.

02:10.047 --> 02:12.491
I just know that I've been stuck here...

02:12.591 --> 02:15.551
like this one fucking time before,
you know that?

02:17.513 --> 02:19.013
Yeah.

02:25.395 --> 02:28.173
There's not another road anywhere
that looks like this road.

02:28.273 --> 02:30.900
I mean, exactly like this road.

02:33.111 --> 02:35.180
It's one kind of place.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.106
One of a kind.

02:38.492 --> 02:41.270
Like someone's face.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.252
Like a fucked-up face.

03:01.098 --> 03:03.709
Where do you think you're running, man?

03:03.809 --> 03:06.227
We're stuck here together, you shit.

03:56.320 --> 03:59.822
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be all right.

04:00.824 --> 04:03.492
I know. It's okay.

04:04.870 --> 04:08.357
I know, you're sorry. I know.

04:31.104 --> 04:35.425
<i>The cattle are prowlin'
The coyotes are howlin'</i>

04:35.525 --> 04:39.471
<i>Way out where the doggies bawl</i>

04:39.571 --> 04:44.393
<i>Where spurs are a-jinglin',
a cowboy is singin'</i>

04:44.493 --> 04:49.106
<i>This lonesome cattle call</i>

05:07.099 --> 05:11.461
<i>He rides in the saddle
till his day's work is done</i>

05:11.561 --> 05:15.398
<i>And he rounds up the cattle each fall</i>

06:45.113 --> 06:47.015
Walt.

06:47.115 --> 06:49.992
- Walt.
- Yeah, Mike?

06:51.203 --> 06:54.940
You think, um, that you could
spot me 10 more dollars?

06:55.040 --> 06:58.819
Ten dollars? What's the matter?
You can't get it from your dad?

06:58.919 --> 07:01.238
My dad and I don't get along too well.
You know that, Walt.

07:01.338 --> 07:03.532
We're not getting along
that well either now, are we?

07:03.632 --> 07:05.701
No. We don't get along too well...

07:05.801 --> 07:09.246
or else he wouldn't have gone out
and drowned himself at Boxcar Canyon.

07:09.346 --> 07:11.248
- Again?
- Yeah.

07:11.348 --> 07:13.291
He hit the water this time?

07:13.391 --> 07:16.044
- He survived the first time. This time...
- Oh, God.

07:16.144 --> 07:18.255
You're the only one I can ask.
You know that, Walt.

07:18.355 --> 07:21.941
Please! I'll owe you a date.
How about that?

07:23.235 --> 07:25.721
I'll owe you a date. Please.

07:25.821 --> 07:28.181
Oh, God, crying tears. Hold on.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.782
Here you go.

07:30.909 --> 07:32.868
Thanks.

07:53.056 --> 07:54.557
Don't worry.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.503
Everything's gonna be all right.

07:58.903 --> 08:03.524
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be all right.

08:55.660 --> 08:58.480
Here. Now, mind the carpet. It's white.

08:58.580 --> 09:01.332
Give me your shoes. Give me your shoes.

09:03.335 --> 09:06.696
Mmm. Mmm.

09:06.796 --> 09:08.782
Okay, just a sec.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.842
Put these on...
so you don't make a mess.

09:22.979 --> 09:25.549
I am so lucky.

09:25.649 --> 09:29.886
I was born on April 4, 1944.

09:29.986 --> 09:33.223
That's 4-4-44.

09:33.323 --> 09:36.309
If you add that up, it comes to 16.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.979
One, six.

09:39.079 --> 09:42.190
One plus six is seven.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.250
Luckiest number of all.

09:47.671 --> 09:51.992
- You know your math.
- It's more than math, Mike.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.592
It's...

09:55.595 --> 09:58.347
immaculate perfection.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.268
Oh.

10:11.486 --> 10:15.906
Boy, this place is a mess.

10:17.867 --> 10:22.314
Yeah, let's make it immaculate.

10:22.414 --> 10:24.373
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:25.375 --> 10:28.612
<i>Deep night</i>

10:28.712 --> 10:33.742
<i>Stars in the sky above</i>

10:33.842 --> 10:37.120
<i>Moonlight</i>

10:37.220 --> 10:40.556
<i>Lighting our place of love</i>

10:42.225 --> 10:45.378
<i>Night winds</i>

10:45.478 --> 10:50.508
<i>Seem to have gone to rest</i>

10:50.608 --> 10:53.345
<i>Two eyes</i>

10:53.445 --> 10:56.014
Faster, little Dutch boy.

10:56.114 --> 10:58.558
Harder.

11:01.870 --> 11:05.414
Yeah, that sound. That sound.

11:06.583 --> 11:10.362
<i>Vow that you'll love me always</i>

11:10.462 --> 11:14.324
<i>And be mine alone</i>

11:14.424 --> 11:19.120
- I'm all done.
- <i>Deep night</i>

11:19.220 --> 11:23.458
And now, my lucky 44th...

11:23.558 --> 11:25.669
little Dutch boy...

11:25.769 --> 11:28.296
you must scrub...

11:28.396 --> 11:30.356
Daddy Carroll.

11:47.332 --> 11:49.958
This chick's living in a new car ad.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.866
Feels like a dream.

11:56.966 --> 12:00.120
A girl never picks me up,
much less a pretty, rich girl.

12:00.220 --> 12:03.972
They don't? I don't know why that is.

12:06.142 --> 12:08.628
This is a nice home.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.506
- Do you live here?
- Yes.

12:11.606 --> 12:13.607
I don't blame you.

12:17.362 --> 12:18.862
Oh.

12:20.824 --> 12:22.809
Hey.

12:22.909 --> 12:26.062
What up, Scott? What up, Gary?

12:26.162 --> 12:28.315
Hey, it's Mikey the dike.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.442
You men make yourselves comfortable.

12:30.542 --> 12:32.402
I'll be right back.

12:32.502 --> 12:34.670
There are cokes in the refrigerator.
Help yourselves.

12:36.548 --> 12:41.077
She's cool. She just likes to have three guys
'cause it takes her a while to get warmed up.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.720
It's normal. Nothing kinky.

12:44.848 --> 12:45.957
Yeah.

12:46.057 --> 12:48.934
Hey, dude, did you get into that
Sinéad O'Connor concert last night?

12:50.478 --> 12:53.465
- What? To... To the Sinéad...
- The chick with the bald head.

12:53.565 --> 12:56.358
I-I've never been
to a concert before, dude.

13:12.876 --> 13:15.002
This is nice.

13:30.435 --> 13:32.394
Backyard.

14:56.104 --> 14:58.146
Oh, shit.

14:59.190 --> 15:01.134
He always does this.

15:01.234 --> 15:04.179
I'm surprised he can exist like this.

15:04.279 --> 15:06.222
How do we know he's okay?

15:06.322 --> 15:09.074
Well, he's not dead. Listen.

15:12.787 --> 15:15.914
He's not dead. He's just passed out.
It's a condition.

15:17.292 --> 15:19.736
He really scared the shit
out of that lady.

15:19.836 --> 15:21.779
What causes it? Sex?

15:21.879 --> 15:25.575
Narcolepsy doctors are saying it's brought on
by certain chemical reactions in the brain.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.744
Comes about in situations of stress.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.761
Some hustler, huh?

15:31.764 --> 15:34.334
Well, where are we gonna take him?

15:34.434 --> 15:36.377
We can't just leave him here.

15:36.477 --> 15:38.520
Come on, Mikey.

15:58.708 --> 16:00.610
Hey, Mike, you stay here.

16:00.710 --> 16:03.321
When you wake up, come back into town.
I'll be waiting for you.

16:03.421 --> 16:07.200
You'll be safer here in this comfy
neighborhood than in the city.

16:08.181 --> 16:11.079
I grew up in a neighborhood like this.

16:11.179 --> 16:12.902
And my dad...

16:14.140 --> 16:16.125
he has more fucking righteous gall...

16:16.225 --> 16:19.837
than all the property
and people he lords over...

16:19.937 --> 16:24.050
and those he also created...
like me, his son.

16:24.150 --> 16:28.263
But I almost get sick thinking
that I am a son to him.

16:28.363 --> 16:30.974
You know you have to be
as good as him to keep up.

16:31.074 --> 16:33.184
You have to be able
to lift as big a weight.

16:33.284 --> 16:35.770
You have to be able
to throw that weight as far...

16:35.870 --> 16:39.122
or make as much money,
or be as heartless.

16:43.294 --> 16:46.489
My dad doesn't know that I'm just a kid.

16:46.589 --> 16:48.507
He thinks I'm a threat.

16:52.529 --> 16:54.923
No, I won't listen!
I won't listen to you!

16:55.023 --> 16:58.350
Hey, Scotty! Come on, you big stud!

17:11.823 --> 17:14.851
When you wake up,
wipe the slugs off your face.

17:14.951 --> 17:17.703
Get ready for a new day.

18:17.555 --> 18:19.916
I never thought I could
make it as a real model.

18:20.016 --> 18:22.627
You know, fashion-oriented modeling.

18:22.727 --> 18:25.672
'Cause I'm better at full-body poses.

18:25.772 --> 18:28.800
It's all right so long as the photographer
doesn't come on to you...

18:28.900 --> 18:30.843
and expect something for nothing.

18:30.943 --> 18:34.263
I'm trying to make a living.
I like to have a professional attitude.

18:34.363 --> 18:37.892
Of course,
if the guy can pay me, hell yeah.

18:37.992 --> 18:41.145
Here I am for him. I'll sell my ass.

18:41.245 --> 18:43.272
Do it on the street
occasionally for cash.

18:43.372 --> 18:45.400
Or I'll be on the cover of a book.

18:45.500 --> 18:49.320
It's when you start doing things for free
that you start to grow wings.

18:49.420 --> 18:51.421
Isn't that right, Mike?

18:54.383 --> 18:56.786
- What?
- Wings, Michael.

18:56.886 --> 18:58.788
You grow wings and become a fairy.

18:58.888 --> 19:00.998
What do you care about money?
Shit, you got plenty of money.

19:01.098 --> 19:03.626
Why don't you go ahead
and do whatever it is that you do...

19:03.726 --> 19:06.170
I can only imagine what that is...
for free?

19:06.270 --> 19:08.423
Is that right, sweetie?

19:08.523 --> 19:11.676
So, how much is a lot of money, honey?

19:11.776 --> 19:15.612
What are you doing on the cover
of that magazine? Slumming?

19:17.448 --> 19:20.601
Actually, Mikey's right.
I am going to inherit money.

19:20.701 --> 19:22.577
A lot of money.

19:56.153 --> 19:57.513
Hi.

19:57.613 --> 19:59.599
- What's happening?
- Nothing.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.893
- You want a lift?
- A lift?

20:01.993 --> 20:03.493
Yes.

20:06.664 --> 20:09.567
Isn't this that, uh... that lady's car?

20:09.667 --> 20:11.694
- What's her name?
- Alena.

20:11.794 --> 20:13.696
- Is she a friend of yours?
- No, not really.

20:13.796 --> 20:16.715
- She's a very good friend of mine.
- Good.

20:17.842 --> 20:21.928
Any friend of Alena's
a good friend of mine.

20:27.643 --> 20:31.422
- You want to be my friend?
- No.

20:31.522 --> 20:33.481
My name is Hans.

20:34.483 --> 20:36.385
I'm from Germany.

20:36.485 --> 20:38.304
Now I live in America...

20:38.404 --> 20:41.207
- selling pieces for cars.
- Mm-hmm.

20:41.490 --> 20:44.977
- Say, why don't you get in?
- No.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.855
I take you wherever you want to go.

20:47.955 --> 20:50.983
- Where you want to go?
- Home.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.110
- Get in the car.
- No.

20:53.210 --> 20:56.364
This guy's a pervert. I can tell, man.

20:56.464 --> 21:00.634
Why don't you go home? Go the fuck home.

21:37.421 --> 21:39.657
How did we get home?

21:39.757 --> 21:42.118
That German guy, Hans.

21:42.218 --> 21:44.954
He brought you downtown.
You were passed out.

21:45.054 --> 21:48.833
He said he was heading to Portland,
so I asked him for a ride.

21:48.933 --> 21:52.060
For some reason, I'm forgetting
a German guy named Hans.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.313
Well, you were sleeping.

21:58.734 --> 22:01.736
So, how much do you make off me
when I'm asleep?

22:06.075 --> 22:08.034
Just a ride, Mike.

22:09.245 --> 22:11.162
I don't make anything.

22:12.498 --> 22:15.250
What, you think I sell your body
while you're asleep?

22:18.087 --> 22:20.797
No, Mike, I'm on your side.

22:27.555 --> 22:30.499
Gary's up here somewhere.
He left about three days ago.

22:30.599 --> 22:32.501
He flew up here with a...

22:32.601 --> 22:34.503
hairdresser.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.672
Exotic.

22:36.772 --> 22:39.842
I heard something about Bob
coming up here to town. Is that true?

22:39.942 --> 22:42.094
- You hear anything about that?
- Bob.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.513
Bob.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.682
I don't know. I hope he's in town.

22:46.782 --> 22:51.354
- We'll have fun if Bob's in town.
- Yeah, I wouldn't mind seeing him.

22:51.454 --> 22:54.523
Hey, didn't you two have like a...

22:54.623 --> 22:58.611
I kind of remember you
having, like, this real heavy, uh...

22:58.711 --> 23:01.405
- Thing?
- Thing. A heavy thing goin', right?

23:01.505 --> 23:05.284
- Yeah, we had a real heavy thing going.
- Huh.

23:05.384 --> 23:09.012
- He was fucking in love with me.
- That's what I thought.

23:10.639 --> 23:13.850
- Yes.
- He taught me better than school did.

23:15.978 --> 23:18.146
I love Bob more than my father.

23:19.565 --> 23:24.762
I'd say I love Bob more
than my mother and my father.

23:24.862 --> 23:28.656
Yeah, I wouldn't mind seeing him.
I'm... I'm hoping that he comes to town.

23:37.958 --> 23:39.860
Hey, you dick!

23:39.960 --> 23:42.238
Scotty, my friend.

23:42.338 --> 23:45.241
Ah, you... Hey. You like that, huh?
You like that.

23:45.341 --> 23:48.452
My new Nikes. My new bracelet.

23:48.552 --> 23:50.955
It says Rudy, though, but that's cool.

23:51.055 --> 23:53.457
My new Calvins.

23:53.557 --> 23:56.377
What a dickhead.

23:56.477 --> 23:58.629
So stupid.

24:08.030 --> 24:09.932
Not when I'm eating.
Don't blow it in my face.

24:10.032 --> 24:11.616
It's the smoking section.

24:16.288 --> 24:19.734
Um, this guy books up
in a black Porsche around the corner.

24:19.834 --> 24:24.280
Uh, I'm asking my friend if,
you know, this guy's okay, if he's cool.

24:24.380 --> 24:26.365
They say... They say,
"Yeah, he'll treat you really good.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.993
He'll, uh, you know...
He'll... He'll pay you what you want.

24:29.093 --> 24:31.954
He'll, you know... He'll smoke weed with you.
He'll do whatever."

24:32.054 --> 24:34.540
I hadn't dated before or tricked...

24:34.640 --> 24:36.917
or done anything like that before,
so I went with this guy.

24:37.017 --> 24:40.254
- Blew it off.
- Well... Uh...

24:40.354 --> 24:42.548
"Let's go to... Let's go to the park.
Let's go to Washington Park."

24:42.648 --> 24:45.217
So, I said, "Okay. That's cool.
Let's go to Washington Park then."

24:45.317 --> 24:47.178
And, uh, all of a sudden,
before I know it...

24:47.278 --> 24:49.805
I mean, I already laid down the law
before I got into the car.

24:49.905 --> 24:52.308
I told him what I do
and what I don't do.

24:52.408 --> 24:55.519
So, uh, we got up there, and he just
started doing whatever he wanted.

24:55.619 --> 24:58.314
My first date was in Portland.
I was, um...

24:58.414 --> 25:00.691
I was hanging out
at the City Club one night.

25:00.791 --> 25:03.486
I was frying really hard
on acid and speed.

25:03.586 --> 25:06.197
There was this big black guy
who had a lot of eight balls...

25:06.297 --> 25:08.574
of speed and a lot of money.

25:08.674 --> 25:11.327
And, uh, he wanted to get
his dick sucked.

25:11.427 --> 25:14.038
And, uh, I was pretty broke,
and he offered me 60 bucks...

25:14.138 --> 25:15.623
and a bunch of speed.

25:15.723 --> 25:19.251
- So, I went up to his hotel...
- I guess you're just gonna starve.

25:19.351 --> 25:21.670
What she's feeling sorry for herself for?
What's that all about?

25:21.770 --> 25:23.881
So, the plan was, uh...
He was on the third floor.

25:23.981 --> 25:27.802
So my buddy Scott would hang out
on the street on a bench down there.

25:27.902 --> 25:31.472
When I got up to his room, I was gonna
toss the money out the window to Scott.

25:31.572 --> 25:36.102
There's not fucking much I could do. I was
up in the... in the woods, in a thicket.

25:36.202 --> 25:39.647
I couldn't get out or anything like that.
I wouldn't do what he wanted me to do.

25:39.747 --> 25:42.233
So, he just kind of flipped out
all over me.

25:42.333 --> 25:47.029
He basically raped me. He put
a fuckin' wine bottle up my butt, right?

25:47.129 --> 25:49.031
It was, like... It was, like, horrible.

25:49.131 --> 25:51.242
So, we get up there in the room,
and he, like, just...

25:51.342 --> 25:54.620
He starts getting naked and jackin' off
and shit. And I start gettin' freaked out.

25:54.720 --> 25:57.456
And I say,
"No, I don't want to do this date."

25:57.556 --> 26:01.043
I say, "Let's go down to the street, and I'll
get the money back from my friend Scott.

26:01.143 --> 26:03.462
And we'll just...
we'll cancel it, right?"

26:03.562 --> 26:05.714
So, we go down to the street
to get the money back...

26:05.814 --> 26:07.716
and Scott's, like, long gone, you know.

26:10.236 --> 26:12.888
What's this? Ooh!

26:12.988 --> 26:17.393
So we're hanging out, and I'm all, "Wait.
He'll be right back. Let's just wait for him."

26:17.493 --> 26:19.130
So, we wait about five minutes,

26:19.230 --> 26:22.731
and he starts telling me how he's gonna
kick my fuckin' ass and shit.

26:22.831 --> 26:27.528
And how my friend's gone and how he's gonna
kill me and all this shit and beat me up.

26:27.628 --> 26:31.574
So I had to go upstairs
and do the date anyway. And, um...

26:31.674 --> 26:34.743
This black guy, he had
a big old fucking cock and shit.

26:34.843 --> 26:38.998
And, um, it was this totally
awful experience, um...

26:39.098 --> 26:43.919
And that was... that was my first date.
I never did another one until a year later.

27:16.385 --> 27:19.554
Jesus. The things we've seen.

27:20.723 --> 27:24.543
Do you remember a thing
since we moved from graffiti bridge?

27:24.643 --> 27:26.144
No more of that, Budd.

27:32.568 --> 27:36.430
Hey, Scotty! Here comes that fat guy!

27:36.530 --> 27:38.307
- He owes me money!
- Who?

27:38.407 --> 27:41.894
You know, the fat one, Pigeon!

27:41.994 --> 27:45.439
"I think that I shall never see...

27:45.539 --> 27:48.067
a poem as lovely as a tree."

27:48.167 --> 27:51.362
Hey, everybody!
There goes Bob, the chiseler!

27:51.462 --> 27:54.615
Here comes Bob, the sewer!

27:54.715 --> 27:56.575
The thrasher!

27:56.675 --> 27:59.495
I think my friends can see...

27:59.595 --> 28:01.580
that I am back from Boise.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.583
- And the listener!
- Hey, everybody, look!

28:04.683 --> 28:06.585
- And more than that...
- Bob's back!

28:06.685 --> 28:08.170
my real father.

28:08.270 --> 28:12.007
- Is Jane Lightwork alive, Bob?
- She's alive, Budd.

28:12.107 --> 28:16.345
- Is she holding on?
- Old. Old, Budd.

28:16.445 --> 28:20.599
She must be old. She has no choice.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.685
Here comes Santa Claus!

28:22.785 --> 28:25.286
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

28:26.663 --> 28:29.358
Jesus, the things we've seen.

28:29.458 --> 28:32.861
Aren't I right, Bob? Aren't I right?

28:32.961 --> 28:35.614
We have heard the chimes at midnight.

28:35.714 --> 28:38.867
That we have. That we have.

28:38.967 --> 28:42.246
In fact, Bob, we have.

28:42.346 --> 28:45.515
Jesus. The things we've seen.

29:02.866 --> 29:06.061
- Where's Bob?
- Crashed out in his room.

29:06.161 --> 29:08.496
Snoring like a horse.

29:25.931 --> 29:27.499
What did you get?

29:27.599 --> 29:29.934
I think this is coke.
I'm not sure though.

29:34.022 --> 29:36.274
Yeah, it's fucking coke.

29:41.237 --> 29:42.348
Oh, fuck!

29:42.448 --> 29:45.601
What the hell? Scott.

29:45.701 --> 29:47.895
My true son.

29:47.995 --> 29:52.733
- How are you? What time is it?
- What do you care?

29:52.833 --> 29:56.528
Why, you wouldn't even look at a clock
unless hours were lines of coke...

29:56.628 --> 29:59.073
dials looked like
the signs of gay bars...

29:59.173 --> 30:02.576
or time itself was
a fair hustler in black leather.

30:02.676 --> 30:05.079
Isn't that right, Bob?

30:06.638 --> 30:09.765
There's no reason to know the time.
We are timeless.

30:11.310 --> 30:14.171
Aren't you forgetting, Scotty, my boy...

30:14.271 --> 30:16.423
the mayor's son, no less...

30:16.523 --> 30:18.441
that we who steal...

30:20.569 --> 30:22.971
do so at midnight?

30:23.071 --> 30:24.989
Who ripped me off?

30:26.658 --> 30:28.644
Budd! Budd!

30:28.744 --> 30:33.399
- Yes, Bob?
- I fell asleep, and I've been robbed!

30:33.499 --> 30:34.532
Jane!

30:34.632 --> 30:37.495
You'd think I could keep
the peace of my house.

30:37.795 --> 30:40.889
Jane! I know you well enough.

30:40.989 --> 30:44.451
Bob! Bob, we'll find your drugs.

30:44.551 --> 30:47.011
We'll find them.

30:50.599 --> 30:53.710
This hotel is full of thieves, junkies!

30:53.810 --> 30:55.478
You are the thief.

30:57.356 --> 31:00.134
You have corrupted me, Scotty.

31:00.234 --> 31:02.995
I was an innocent before I met you.

31:03.695 --> 31:07.141
And now look at me,
just a little better than wicked.

31:07.241 --> 31:09.268
- I used to be a virtuous man.
- Ha!

31:09.368 --> 31:11.437
Well, virtuous enough.

31:11.537 --> 31:15.023
I swore a little. I never gambled
more than seven times a week! Poker!

31:15.123 --> 31:17.443
I never picked up a street boy
more than once a quarter.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.069
- Of an hour!
- Of an hour.

31:19.169 --> 31:22.865
Bad company has corrupted me.

31:22.965 --> 31:26.285
I'll be darned if I haven't forgotten
what the inside of a church looks like.

31:27.585 --> 31:30.289
I see a change for Bob to make.

31:30.389 --> 31:33.834
From stealing... to preaching.

31:33.934 --> 31:36.545
Stealing is my vocation, Scott.

31:36.645 --> 31:38.755
- It's not a sin for a man...
- Hey, psst!

31:38.855 --> 31:40.507
to labor at his vocation.

31:40.607 --> 31:42.551
Very early tomorrow morning
there's gonna be a bunch...

31:42.651 --> 31:46.013
of small-time rock-and-roll promoters
coming back from their gig.

31:46.113 --> 31:48.432
And every night they walk home
with the loot.

31:48.532 --> 31:50.726
They stop by the Grotto Bar.
It's about a half...

31:50.826 --> 31:53.228
No, it's about mile
down the road from here.

31:53.328 --> 31:56.565
Dude, if we can't steal from them
going into the bar...

31:56.665 --> 31:58.734
dude, we can get them comin' out!

31:58.834 --> 32:00.777
- See, Bob, dude?
- Not me.

32:00.877 --> 32:03.280
So long as I don't know these
guys personally, it's okay with me.

32:03.380 --> 32:07.075
See, uh... They're from Beaverton,
new to the business.

32:07.175 --> 32:11.163
I'm not gonna go along with this crackpot
scheme, especially since Gary thought it up.

32:11.263 --> 32:14.291
Come off it, Mike.
There is a better way to make a buck...

32:14.391 --> 32:16.793
something to fall back on
other than your ass.

32:16.893 --> 32:18.879
I'll fall back
when Scott inherits his money.

32:21.690 --> 32:25.093
Bob, we don't need these guys.
We can do this ourself. Fuck them!

32:25.193 --> 32:27.596
- Come on. I have a joke I want to play.
- Okay.

32:27.696 --> 32:31.642
- A joke I can't pull off alone.
- Okay. I think that stuff was...

32:32.718 --> 32:35.479
- Bob!
- Oh, my sweetheart.

32:35.579 --> 32:39.107
- Come and rob with us tomorrow.
- I was going to anyway. I was just kidding.

32:39.207 --> 32:41.151
- Good.
- Right? We'll have fun.

32:41.251 --> 32:42.945
- All right.
- We'll be rich!

32:43.045 --> 32:44.488
- Yeah, we'll be rich.
- We're gonna be rich.

32:44.588 --> 32:47.407
- Gary says we'll be rich!
- We're gonna be rich!

32:47.507 --> 32:50.953
We're gonna be rich.
We're gonna be rich.

32:51.053 --> 32:52.955
We're gonna be rich.

32:53.055 --> 32:54.957
Ho! Ho! Ho!

32:55.057 --> 32:57.834
Budd? Budd. It's all right, Budd.

32:57.934 --> 33:01.213
Budd, just... just relax, Budd.

33:01.313 --> 33:04.440
Provide for us,
oh, great psychedelic papa!

33:06.902 --> 33:08.804
Scotty!

33:08.904 --> 33:12.307
When you inherit your fortune
on your 21st birthday...

33:12.407 --> 33:16.019
Let's see. How far away is this?

33:16.119 --> 33:19.038
One week away, Bob. Just one more week.

33:20.957 --> 33:25.654
Let's not call ourselves robbers
but Diana's foresters...

33:25.754 --> 33:28.031
gentlemen of the shade...

33:28.131 --> 33:30.341
minions of the moon...

33:31.927 --> 33:33.844
men of good government.

33:50.696 --> 33:54.558
When I turn 21,
I don't want any more of this life.

33:54.658 --> 33:59.229
My mother and father will be surprised
at the incredible change.

33:59.329 --> 34:03.025
It will impress them more
when such a fuckup like me turns good...

34:03.125 --> 34:06.111
than if I had been a good son all along.

34:06.211 --> 34:09.906
All my bad behavior
I will throw away to pay a debt.

34:10.005 --> 34:13.201
I will change when everybody
expects it the least.

34:14.001 --> 34:17.304
You'll become a head-roller...
a hatchet man for your old man.

34:18.889 --> 34:20.542
No!

34:20.641 --> 34:22.668
You will be the hatchet man, Bob!

34:22.768 --> 34:24.880
That will be your job.

34:24.980 --> 34:28.382
And so there will rarely
be a job hatcheted.

34:28.483 --> 34:33.972
It will all be just one endless party.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.741
Won't it?

34:38.076 --> 34:41.730
But at least my little friend
has offered me a job.

34:41.830 --> 34:44.665
They're so good to me.

34:52.047 --> 34:55.702
How long has it been, Bob,
since you could see your dick?

34:55.802 --> 34:57.746
About four years, Scotty.

34:57.846 --> 35:01.875
Four years of grief
blows a man up like a balloon.

35:01.975 --> 35:05.954
- There's rock-and-roll money coming this way!
- And they're drunk as skunks!

35:11.443 --> 35:14.429
All right. All right.
You four should head them off there.

35:14.529 --> 35:16.848
We four? How many are walking with 'em?

35:16.948 --> 35:20.394
- There's five of 'em.
- Five? Shouldn't they be robbing us?

35:20.494 --> 35:24.773
All right. If they escape from you guys,
Mike and I will get 'em here.

35:24.873 --> 35:28.026
Oh, eight feet of this muck's
like 30 yards of flat road...

35:28.126 --> 35:30.654
Would you guys shut up?
Shut up! Pay attention.

35:30.754 --> 35:34.799
- Squat down! Squat down!
- Squat down? You got a crane to lift me up?

35:41.681 --> 35:44.710
- Where are our disguises?
- Right behind us.

35:48.814 --> 35:50.773
- Let's go.
- Okay.

35:52.859 --> 35:55.595
- Who are these jokers, man?
- Look like Rajneesh.

35:58.698 --> 36:00.892
This one looks like
he's a little thirsty.

36:04.037 --> 36:06.648
Up against the wall, you sully scumbags!

36:06.748 --> 36:08.233
Don't shoot.

36:12.479 --> 36:16.158
- Up against the wall.
- Come on! Come on!

36:17.753 --> 36:21.129
- Don't shoot us.
- That's right.

36:23.515 --> 36:28.003
- Fags.
- Okay, set the box down. That's right.

36:28.103 --> 36:32.507
Thank you.
Nice and gently. Nice and gently.

36:32.607 --> 36:34.692
Let's see what we have.

36:37.571 --> 36:41.448
Yes, my baby doll. Ooh.

36:43.159 --> 36:45.536
Tickets, anyone, for next week's show?

36:48.999 --> 36:51.735
Scott and Mike have disappeared.

36:51.835 --> 36:54.696
Could the shots have scared them away?

36:54.796 --> 36:56.698
Maybe we should
get the hell out of here.

36:56.798 --> 36:58.841
Are they such chickens?

37:17.277 --> 37:19.320
Let's get the hell out of here!

37:22.490 --> 37:24.491
The thieves scatter!

37:25.994 --> 37:28.404
Bob Pigeon will sweat to death.

37:36.588 --> 37:38.740
Has anyone seen my son?

37:38.840 --> 37:41.993
It's been a full three months
since I last saw him.

37:42.993 --> 37:44.746
Where is my son Scott?

37:44.846 --> 37:47.249
- We don't know, sir.
- Ask around in old town.

37:47.349 --> 37:48.917
Some of the taverns there.

37:49.017 --> 37:52.212
Some say he frequently is seen down there
drinking with street denizens.

37:52.312 --> 37:55.799
Some who they say even rob
our citizens and store owners.

37:55.899 --> 38:00.262
I can't believe that such an effeminate boy
supports such friends.

38:23.009 --> 38:27.721
Hey, Mikey, how long have I been here
on the streets on this crusade?

38:28.598 --> 38:31.251
Huh. W-Well, I came back to town
around three and a half years ago...

38:31.351 --> 38:33.044
and that's when I met you.

38:33.144 --> 38:35.046
- So, it's been...
- It's been three years, Mike.

38:35.146 --> 38:38.133
Yeah, almost four years.
That's a long time.

38:38.233 --> 38:41.986
What I'm getting at, Mike,
is that we're still alive.

38:44.072 --> 38:47.309
Yeah. Well, that's obvious, isn't it?

38:47.409 --> 38:50.872
Yeah. It's incredibly obvious.

38:51.272 --> 38:54.589
They could drop a big old bomb
on this city. Know what we would do?

38:54.689 --> 38:56.583
Take shelter?

39:09.264 --> 39:12.667
- This bike was caught with much ease, Mike.
- Yes.

39:12.767 --> 39:14.753
And the reward for the joke
that we played last night...

39:14.853 --> 39:18.924
will be the unbelievably huge lies
that Bob will come up with now.

39:23.236 --> 39:26.405
A plague on all cowards!

39:28.158 --> 39:31.394
What's up, Bob? Where have you been?

39:31.494 --> 39:34.272
Where have I been?

39:34.372 --> 39:38.485
If manhood's not forgotten on the face
of the earth, then I'm a shot herring.

39:38.585 --> 39:40.695
You sit down, you little fuck.

39:40.795 --> 39:42.906
A mayor's son.

39:43.006 --> 39:46.284
If I jog you out of that right
and teach you to be a man...

39:46.384 --> 39:50.705
your father would be as proud of me
as he would you, Scotty!

39:50.805 --> 39:53.708
Why, you whoring round man.

39:53.808 --> 39:56.628
What is the matter?

39:56.728 --> 39:59.923
Are you not a coward? Answer that.

40:00.023 --> 40:03.259
- And that goes double.
- You calling me a coward? You fat duck.

40:03.359 --> 40:06.972
I'd give a thousand dollars
to be able to run as fast as you can.

40:07.072 --> 40:10.058
- It'll never happen, Bob.
- Where's the money, Bob?

40:10.158 --> 40:12.185
Where is it?

40:12.285 --> 40:15.689
- Taken from us by 20 or 30 punks.
- Thirty?

40:15.789 --> 40:17.941
I was struggling with a dozen of them.

40:18.041 --> 40:20.026
I think my arm's broken from the fight.

40:20.126 --> 40:23.322
Certainly a toe. Most definitely a rib.

40:24.022 --> 40:27.993
- Let me tell you about it.
- Tell us about it, please.

40:28.093 --> 40:31.788
- We four set upon a dozen of 'em.
- Sixteen, at least, Digger, my boy.

40:31.888 --> 40:36.084
Yeah, and got their money. As we were
splitting it, 16 others set upon us.

40:36.184 --> 40:39.129
Thank God you had not
murdered some of them.

40:39.229 --> 40:44.608
Murdered?
Well, they are past praying for.

40:45.735 --> 40:47.971
I peppered two of them.

40:48.071 --> 40:51.099
- Two punks in leather jackets.
- What?

40:51.199 --> 40:54.019
- I'll tell you, son. These four came in close.
- You said there were two...

40:54.119 --> 40:57.397
Four! I said there were four, Scott.

40:57.497 --> 40:58.857
Four.

40:58.957 --> 41:02.777
These four came from the front,
kicking at me, pulling their knives.

41:02.877 --> 41:06.156
And I whipped out the blade
and took all seven as a target, like this!

41:06.256 --> 41:09.075
Seven! Just a second ago,
there were four.

41:09.175 --> 41:11.453
- In leather?
- No, Bob, my friend.

41:11.553 --> 41:13.538
There was four of 'em,
and they all had leather on.

41:13.638 --> 41:15.832
Seven, by my count.

41:15.932 --> 41:18.543
Leave him alone.
We shall have more soon.

41:18.643 --> 41:22.005
As I was saying, these nine in the alleyway
that I told you about...

41:22.105 --> 41:25.216
There's more already, I see. Nine?

41:25.316 --> 41:30.805
Full force, and with thought,
seven of the 11 I pegged!

41:30.905 --> 41:33.308
There are 11 now. He started with two.

41:33.408 --> 41:37.395
But, as the devil would have it,
three of them came at my back.

41:37.495 --> 41:39.814
They were wearing green.

41:39.914 --> 41:42.650
And they had it out with me.

41:42.750 --> 41:45.252
Because it was so dark, Scotty...

41:46.337 --> 41:49.282
that you could not see your hand.

41:51.634 --> 41:54.496
How could you see green
when it was so dark...

41:54.596 --> 41:56.498
that you couldn't see your hand?

41:58.975 --> 42:01.544
- Tell us the reason. Come on, Bob.
- Tell us!

42:01.644 --> 42:03.671
- Come on, Bob!
- Tell us the reason, Bob!

42:03.771 --> 42:06.273
- Tell us why.
- You can tell 'em. Go on and tell 'em.

42:07.650 --> 42:10.845
- Upon compulsion?
- Come on, Bob.

42:10.945 --> 42:14.599
Not for you or I or all the rest
of the world would I tell you...

42:14.699 --> 42:16.617
on compulsion!

42:17.952 --> 42:21.356
I will no longer be guilty of this sin!

42:21.456 --> 42:25.276
This sanguine coward,
this horseback-breaker...

42:25.376 --> 42:28.629
this huge hill of jelly!

42:33.635 --> 42:35.870
Punk! You starfish!

42:35.970 --> 42:40.750
Oh, for breath to utter
what lies of a tailor's yardstick!

42:40.850 --> 42:43.711
You boot case! You vile punk!

42:43.811 --> 42:47.298
Breathe a while, and then do it again.

42:47.398 --> 42:49.342
But hear me out.

42:49.442 --> 42:54.639
We two saw you four set upon five.

42:54.739 --> 42:56.599
And, Bob...

42:56.699 --> 42:59.993
you carried yourself away
at the slightest noise.

43:01.871 --> 43:05.775
And roared for mercy. And ran and roared
as ever I heard a bull calf.

43:10.838 --> 43:16.744
What trick, what device can you find...

43:16.844 --> 43:20.957
to hide from this open
and apparent shame?

43:21.057 --> 43:23.058
Yes.

43:24.727 --> 43:28.298
What new trick
do you have for us now, Bob?

43:32.151 --> 43:34.069
Good Lord, lads.

43:35.738 --> 43:38.532
I know you as well as he that made you.

43:39.951 --> 43:43.605
Do you think that I
would kill the heir apparent?

43:43.705 --> 43:46.915
Do you think I would
turn on you, Scotty?

43:48.167 --> 43:51.878
Why, you're our only ticket
out of this poverty and oppression.

43:53.589 --> 43:57.452
I am as valued as Hercules.

43:57.552 --> 43:59.469
But beware my instinct.

44:01.222 --> 44:04.224
The lion will not touch the true heir.

44:05.226 --> 44:07.295
Good Lord, lads...

44:07.395 --> 44:09.730
I'm glad you have the money.

44:37.091 --> 44:39.801
If we're looking for a fat man,
why don't we get one under the bridge?

44:40.845 --> 44:45.069
Oh! Oh! The sheriff
and his posse are here.

44:49.020 --> 44:52.272
Scotty, they've come to search
the house. Shall I let them in?

44:54.108 --> 44:56.312
Call in the sheriff!

45:06.621 --> 45:08.789
- God.
- Oh, God, what's that smell?

45:17.358 --> 45:19.575
- Hey! Hey!
- There they are.

45:19.675 --> 45:21.635
- Over there! Over there!
- Come here, you little shit!

45:22.887 --> 45:24.679
Come here!

45:26.015 --> 45:28.141
There he goes! In the door!

45:36.984 --> 45:39.055
Baby, yeah.

45:45.118 --> 45:47.494
Wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait!

45:51.707 --> 45:55.194
Aha! What have we here?

45:55.294 --> 45:59.157
Pardon me, Mr. Favor. An informant
has followed certain men into this house.

45:59.257 --> 46:01.617
- What men?
- One of them is well known, sir.

46:01.717 --> 46:04.871
- A large fat man.
- Fat as butter.

46:04.971 --> 46:07.498
Well, he's not here.

46:07.598 --> 46:10.043
But if I see him...

46:10.143 --> 46:14.380
I'll promise you that
I'll send him to you by...

46:14.480 --> 46:17.342
dinnertime tomorrow...

46:17.442 --> 46:20.928
to answer against any such charges.

46:21.028 --> 46:25.365
So, would you leave us alone?

46:27.702 --> 46:30.078
- You!
- Sorry for the interruption.

46:31.122 --> 46:33.191
We have a message for you
from your father.

46:33.291 --> 46:35.250
He'd like to see you
as soon as possible.

46:36.461 --> 46:38.378
Fuck you.

46:52.435 --> 46:55.046
I don't know whether it is God
trying to get back at me...

46:55.146 --> 46:58.466
for something I have done, but...

46:58.566 --> 47:02.804
your passing through life makes me certain
that you are marked...

47:02.904 --> 47:06.448
and that heaven is punishing me
for my mistreatings.

47:07.450 --> 47:10.061
When I got back from France
and set foot in Clark County...

47:10.161 --> 47:13.914
and saw what your cousin, Bill Davis,
had done at his family's ranch...

47:14.832 --> 47:17.151
I thought, by my soul...

47:17.251 --> 47:21.338
he has more worthy interest to my estate
than you could hold a candle to.

47:22.340 --> 47:26.828
And being no older than you are,
he organizes operations for state senators...

47:26.928 --> 47:29.288
lobbies for the small businessman...

47:29.388 --> 47:33.266
and has an ambitious five-year plan for
the forest that even I would like to support.

47:34.935 --> 47:37.270
And then I have to think of you...

47:38.105 --> 47:40.883
and what a degenerate you are.

47:40.983 --> 47:42.901
Don't think that, Father.

47:44.278 --> 47:46.514
You will find out it's not true.

47:46.614 --> 47:48.599
And I hope that somebody
forgives the people...

47:48.699 --> 47:50.992
that have swayed
your fond thoughts away from me.

47:52.036 --> 47:54.981
For a time will come when I will
make this northern youth...

47:55.081 --> 47:57.832
trade me his good deeds
for my indignities.

47:58.918 --> 48:01.487
Bill Davis is my good cousin.

48:01.587 --> 48:05.324
But even the slightest
worship of his time...

48:05.424 --> 48:07.342
Dad...

48:08.803 --> 48:11.372
I will die...

48:11.472 --> 48:14.417
a hundred thousand deaths...

48:14.517 --> 48:16.476
before that happens.

48:45.047 --> 48:47.408
I wanna see my face
on the front of album covers.

48:47.508 --> 48:49.869
I wanna produce my own music.

48:49.969 --> 48:52.079
You know, I just... I just want
total control over my music.

48:52.179 --> 48:54.499
I wanna engineer it. I wanna mix it.

48:54.599 --> 48:57.418
You know, I wanna... I wanna get
my own say on opening bands.

48:57.518 --> 49:01.881
Then I'd like to, like, stand in back
of bigger pictures of myself.

49:01.981 --> 49:06.052
- That's good.
- And you?

49:06.152 --> 49:08.069
I don't care.

49:09.864 --> 49:11.823
Where should we go?

49:14.160 --> 49:17.730
- To visit my brother.
- You have a brother?

49:17.830 --> 49:21.108
Yeah, I've got a brother, man.
You know that.

49:21.208 --> 49:23.168
Where is he?

49:24.754 --> 49:29.633
Well, I'm thinking he should be
someplace in, uh, the potato state.

49:30.426 --> 49:31.635
Idaho.

49:38.059 --> 49:40.352
Shut up, Mike.

49:42.104 --> 49:45.841
If I'd known it'd be this hard to start,
I wouldn't have stopped it at all.

49:49.904 --> 49:52.072
I've been on this road before.

49:54.950 --> 49:56.451
This is my road.

49:59.080 --> 50:00.997
Looks like a fucked-up face.

50:02.166 --> 50:05.903
Like it's saying, "Have a nice day"
or something.

50:06.003 --> 50:08.088
See what I mean, Scott?

50:09.757 --> 50:11.257
Scott, look.

50:19.350 --> 50:20.850
Thanks.

50:22.436 --> 50:23.971
What?

50:27.775 --> 50:30.219
- You need some help with this, man?
- Shut up.

50:30.319 --> 50:32.513
You shut up.

50:32.613 --> 50:35.641
- You suck.
- Do you know anything about bikes?

50:35.741 --> 50:38.618
Yeah, I-I've turned over a few.

50:43.791 --> 50:46.000
Scott, man, where are you going?

50:56.345 --> 50:58.331
Getting away from everything feels good.

50:58.431 --> 51:00.306
Yeah, it does.

51:01.642 --> 51:04.712
When I left home,
the maid asked me where I was off to.

51:04.812 --> 51:08.716
I said, "Wherever, whatever.

51:08.816 --> 51:10.718
Have a nice day."

51:10.818 --> 51:13.262
You had a maid?

51:13.362 --> 51:14.863
Yeah.

51:21.620 --> 51:25.900
If I had a normal family
and a good upbringing...

51:26.000 --> 51:29.728
then I would have been
a well-adjusted person.

51:31.186 --> 51:33.214
Depends on what you call normal.

51:34.258 --> 51:36.494
Yeah, it does.

51:36.594 --> 51:39.747
Well, you know, normal, like...
like a mom and a dad...

51:39.847 --> 51:41.415
and a dog and shit like that.

51:41.515 --> 51:43.834
Normal. Normal.

51:43.934 --> 51:45.769
So you didn't have a normal dog?

51:47.021 --> 51:49.799
- No, I didn't have a dog.
- You didn't have a... a normal dad?

51:49.899 --> 51:53.860
Didn't have a dog or... or...
or a normal dad anyway.

51:55.279 --> 51:58.683
That's all right.
I don't feel sorry for myself.

51:58.783 --> 52:03.437
I mean, I feel like I'm...
I feel like I'm, you know, well-adjusted.

52:03.537 --> 52:06.065
What's a normal dad?

52:06.165 --> 52:08.708
I don't know.

52:12.087 --> 52:14.573
I'd like to talk with you.

52:14.673 --> 52:18.452
I mean, I'd like
to really talk with you.

52:18.552 --> 52:21.539
We're talking right now,
but, you know...

52:21.639 --> 52:24.390
I don't know.
I... I don't feel like I can be...

52:30.689 --> 52:33.399
I don't feel like I can be close to you.

52:34.485 --> 52:36.194
I mean, we're close.

52:37.238 --> 52:40.725
Right now we're close, but, I mean...
You know...

52:43.577 --> 52:45.286
How close? I mean...

52:46.872 --> 52:49.024
I don't know. Whatever.

52:49.124 --> 52:51.084
What?

52:52.002 --> 52:53.670
What do I mean to you?

52:55.381 --> 52:58.200
What do you mean to me?

52:58.300 --> 53:00.286
Mike, you're my best friend.

53:00.386 --> 53:03.164
I know, man. And I... I know...
I know I'm your friend.

53:03.264 --> 53:06.584
We're good friends. And it's good to be,
you know, good friends.

53:06.684 --> 53:08.643
That's a good thing.

53:10.688 --> 53:12.590
So?

53:12.690 --> 53:14.607
So, I just...

53:19.280 --> 53:20.780
That's okay.

53:23.242 --> 53:25.159
We can be friends.

53:34.169 --> 53:36.572
I only have sex with a guy for money.

53:36.672 --> 53:39.007
Yeah, I know.

53:41.051 --> 53:43.204
And two guys can't love each other.

53:43.304 --> 53:45.581
Yeah.

53:45.681 --> 53:48.292
Well, I... I don't know. I mean...

53:48.392 --> 53:50.018
I mean, for me...

53:52.771 --> 53:55.633
I could love someone even if I...

53:55.733 --> 53:57.692
you know, wasn't paid for it.

54:00.821 --> 54:02.697
I love you and...

54:04.700 --> 54:06.659
you don't pay me.

54:12.666 --> 54:15.668
- Mike.
- I really want to kiss you, man.

54:20.549 --> 54:22.508
Good night, man.

54:31.185 --> 54:33.102
I love you though.

54:37.024 --> 54:38.983
You know that.

54:41.528 --> 54:43.446
I do love you.

54:45.574 --> 54:47.867
All right. Come here, Mike.

54:49.995 --> 54:53.023
It's just like... Come on.

54:53.123 --> 54:55.124
Just go to sleep. Come on.

55:31.078 --> 55:33.647
Oh, shit!

55:33.747 --> 55:35.649
Oh, shit! Oh, man!

55:35.749 --> 55:38.360
Looks like this is it.

55:38.460 --> 55:41.322
Can't get the bike started. Cops are coming.
Stuck in the middle of nowhere.

55:41.422 --> 55:44.325
- Yeah?
- With a stolen bike. Yeah, Mike.

55:44.425 --> 55:46.443
Looks like this is the end.

55:52.474 --> 55:55.544
- Matter with your friend?
- I don't know.

55:55.644 --> 55:57.671
I guess he doesn't like cops.

55:57.771 --> 56:00.523
- Oh, yeah?
- That's how it looks.

56:01.567 --> 56:04.345
What are you guys doing out here?

56:04.445 --> 56:07.113
This cycle is one bitch
to turn over, man.

56:08.115 --> 56:10.434
But I guess you don't know anything
about motorcycles, huh?

56:10.534 --> 56:13.411
- You're not a motorcycle cop.
- I've turned over a few.

56:25.883 --> 56:28.885
Wake up, Mikey. The heat's off.

56:45.736 --> 56:48.488
Look, Mike, sandwiches.

56:51.492 --> 56:52.992
Thanks, man.

56:54.912 --> 56:57.580
Did I ever show you this picture
of you and Mom?

57:03.545 --> 57:06.156
That was taken out by the institution.

57:06.256 --> 57:09.576
We used to go out to that place
on the weekends to see 'em.

57:09.676 --> 57:12.553
You were about one year old
at the time, I think.

57:13.639 --> 57:16.724
I hated that fucking place.

57:19.728 --> 57:23.090
Scott, how do you have a kid
this young in an institution?

57:23.190 --> 57:26.093
- W-What does that mean?
- Why were you in an institution?

57:26.193 --> 57:28.694
- Is that what you're askin' me?
- I'm asking you.

57:29.738 --> 57:33.449
Because of Mom.
They didn't think she was safe.

57:35.119 --> 57:37.855
But we were still a family.

57:37.955 --> 57:40.248
Me, you...

57:41.250 --> 57:43.209
and Mom.

58:00.018 --> 58:02.770
- Where you going?
- Pisser.

58:30.215 --> 58:32.993
Don't give me any of your shit.
Don't give me any of your shit!

58:33.093 --> 58:35.412
- Dick! Dick!
- I don't wanna hear any of your shit!

58:35.512 --> 58:37.623
- Dick! Dick!
- Don't talk to me like that!

58:37.723 --> 58:39.223
Dick!

58:57.451 --> 59:00.703
He's all right.
This happens every time we get together.

59:06.543 --> 59:10.046
You want a drink? This?

59:24.436 --> 59:28.522
You like those?
I paint 'em for a livin'.

59:30.025 --> 59:34.153
Sometimes when they're finished, the people
don't send me the check, so I keep 'em.

59:36.448 --> 59:39.450
I kinda like them hangin' around.
They keep me company.

59:51.546 --> 59:55.075
<i>Run free and sure</i>

59:55.175 --> 59:57.510
<i>No man can take</i>

59:58.637 --> 01:00:02.223
<i>This land from them</i>

01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:06.978
I want you to know the truth
about your mother.

01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:10.189
I know the truth about my mother.

01:00:11.358 --> 01:00:13.276
I mean the real truth.

01:00:15.195 --> 01:00:17.598
- I know.
- You don't know.

01:00:17.698 --> 01:00:22.186
You wanna go around through life
believing the lies?

01:00:22.286 --> 01:00:24.787
Is that what you want?

01:00:25.998 --> 01:00:27.915
Listen to me when I'm talking to you.

01:00:30.877 --> 01:00:34.964
You know, she used to go out at night
and look for men when I was asleep.

01:00:36.216 --> 01:00:38.118
She'd go out
to different bars, you know.

01:00:38.218 --> 01:00:42.456
She'd shake her ass
at anybody that was interested.

01:00:42.556 --> 01:00:44.958
That's how she met that guy from Reno...

01:00:45.058 --> 01:00:48.311
that low-life, gamblin' cowboy fuck.

01:00:50.647 --> 01:00:52.966
He worked at one of
those big casinos in Vegas.

01:00:53.066 --> 01:00:56.178
He got fired for fuckin' with the cards.

01:00:56.278 --> 01:00:59.223
He was a real scumbag.

01:00:59.323 --> 01:01:01.808
But your mother loved him.

01:01:01.908 --> 01:01:03.810
She loved him.

01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:07.147
She had it in her head
that she wanted to marry this guy...

01:01:07.247 --> 01:01:10.776
and go off with him and...
and have a little family...

01:01:10.876 --> 01:01:14.238
with the house and the...
the white picket fence...

01:01:14.338 --> 01:01:16.448
and the dog
and the fuckin' station wagon.

01:01:16.548 --> 01:01:19.201
All that shit.

01:01:19.301 --> 01:01:21.662
But he didn't want to marry her.

01:01:21.762 --> 01:01:23.804
He didn't love her.

01:01:25.307 --> 01:01:27.641
That's around the time
that you were born.

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:34.883
Now, she had a gun.
She used to have this gun.

01:01:34.983 --> 01:01:39.888
It was a... a Smith & Wesson
.38 revolver.

01:01:39.988 --> 01:01:43.976
And she loved this gun. She loved this gun.
She used to sleep with it.

01:01:44.076 --> 01:01:47.646
She used to stir-fry the vegetables
with the loaded gun.

01:01:47.746 --> 01:01:49.856
I remember, I used to say,
"Sharon, what're you doin'?

01:01:49.956 --> 01:01:51.858
You stir-frying vegetables with the gun?

01:01:51.958 --> 01:01:55.044
You're gonna blow a hole
through the frying pan."

01:01:57.089 --> 01:02:00.117
So, one night she goes
to the drive-in movie...

01:02:00.217 --> 01:02:02.134
with this cowboy fuck.

01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:08.208
Jesus Christ. What... What the fuck
was the name of that movie now?

01:02:08.308 --> 01:02:10.585
- It was a western.
- Rio Bravo?

01:02:10.685 --> 01:02:12.645
Right, Rio Bravo.
It was a John Wayne movie.

01:02:15.857 --> 01:02:18.051
During the movie...

01:02:18.151 --> 01:02:20.470
she takes this gun,
sticks it in his mouth...

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:22.655
and blows his brains out.

01:02:24.491 --> 01:02:27.060
Rio Bravo on the big screen.

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:31.914
John Wayne on his horse
ridin' through the desert.

01:02:33.625 --> 01:02:37.821
Spilled popcorn all over the front seat
soakin' up the blood.

01:02:37.921 --> 01:02:40.240
Oh, come on, man. How corny.

01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:42.341
This is why she had to leave.

01:02:46.721 --> 01:02:49.098
And that guy...

01:02:50.892 --> 01:02:53.561
That guy is your real father.

01:02:56.189 --> 01:02:58.967
Don't fuck me in the head anymore, man!

01:02:59.067 --> 01:03:02.346
I know the fucking truth!
I know who my fucking real dad is!

01:03:02.446 --> 01:03:04.473
Who is it? Who?

01:03:04.573 --> 01:03:07.976
- Who?
- Dick, you!

01:03:08.076 --> 01:03:12.246
Richard, you're my dad. I know that.

01:03:17.711 --> 01:03:20.254
You know too much.

01:03:28.346 --> 01:03:30.806
She doesn't want
to see me like this, man.

01:03:39.232 --> 01:03:42.886
I got this from her, I don't know,
a few months ago.

01:03:42.986 --> 01:03:46.556
Fuckin' got blood all over it.
Did you cut your hand?

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:48.642
Stupid.

01:03:48.742 --> 01:03:53.454
"Dear honey, found a job in the lounge
of the Family Tree in Snake River.

01:03:54.498 --> 01:03:57.776
If you're ever out this way,
look me up. Love, Mom."

01:03:57.876 --> 01:04:00.153
"Rooms, phones, color TV.

01:04:00.253 --> 01:04:03.156
Wall-to-wall carpeting,
and efficiently controlled electric heat...

01:04:03.256 --> 01:04:07.366
combination tub and showers,
game table...

01:04:07.968 --> 01:04:12.290
And two reading chairs,
with some connecting rooms."

01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:16.644
It sounds so nice.
I wouldn't mind living here.

01:04:26.279 --> 01:04:28.791
I'm gonna look her up, man.

01:04:47.259 --> 01:04:49.453
Sharon. Sharon.

01:04:49.553 --> 01:04:52.914
There was a Sharon who worked here
about a year ago, but she split.

01:04:53.014 --> 01:04:55.474
Saved up all her money
and headed for Italy.

01:04:56.643 --> 01:04:59.004
- To Italy?
- Yeah, Italy.

01:04:59.104 --> 01:05:01.047
Took her forever to save any cash...

01:05:01.147 --> 01:05:03.758
but, uh, she finally did it
and flew away.

01:05:03.858 --> 01:05:06.678
Said she was lookin' for her family.
Guess she was Italian.

01:05:06.778 --> 01:05:10.307
She didn't look Italian though.
She, uh, left us this address.

01:05:10.407 --> 01:05:14.227
Sharon Waters, Via Casoli, Settevene...

01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:18.398
R-Rome... Roma? Rome.
She's in Rome, Italy.

01:05:18.498 --> 01:05:20.442
- There's that guy.
- What guy?

01:05:20.542 --> 01:05:22.444
Guy who gave us a ride from Portland.

01:05:22.544 --> 01:05:24.446
- Oh, yeah. What's his name?
- What's he doing here?

01:05:24.546 --> 01:05:26.781
- I don't know. Is his name Hans? Hans?
- Hans.

01:05:26.881 --> 01:05:29.174
That's it as usual. Thank you very much.

01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:33.497
Scott. Mike.

01:05:33.597 --> 01:05:35.749
- Hey.
- How nice to run into you boys.

01:05:35.849 --> 01:05:38.267
- How have you been?
- Gut.

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:42.214
See you later.

01:05:42.314 --> 01:05:44.231
407.

01:05:50.238 --> 01:05:52.599
Mike?

01:05:52.699 --> 01:05:55.685
- What?
- I'm extremely excited.

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:57.911
I just got in.
Could you please wait your turn?

01:05:58.997 --> 01:06:01.608
But don't you want
anything to eat, Mike?

01:06:01.708 --> 01:06:05.278
- We are ordering room service, yes?
- Room service?

01:06:05.378 --> 01:06:08.865
Yeah. Uh, four orders
of large french fries...

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:11.284
extra crispy, and some Coke.

01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:13.286
And that's all.

01:06:13.386 --> 01:06:16.623
That makes four portion
of french fries...

01:06:16.723 --> 01:06:18.625
very crispy, and a large Coke.

01:06:18.725 --> 01:06:22.671
- Is that correct now, Mike?
- Ja. Ja. Ja.

01:06:22.771 --> 01:06:25.882
Thank you very much, Mike. Thank you.

01:06:25.982 --> 01:06:27.884
- Thank you.
- See you soon.

01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:29.636
- What?
- See you soon.

01:06:29.736 --> 01:06:31.236
Yeah, right.

01:06:33.156 --> 01:06:35.157
I must show you something.

01:06:38.078 --> 01:06:40.037
My mother.

01:06:41.581 --> 01:06:44.792
Heaven bless her soul.
She died seven years ago.

01:06:45.794 --> 01:06:47.821
She's very beautiful.

01:06:47.921 --> 01:06:49.823
I think so.

01:06:49.923 --> 01:06:52.341
You want to see it?

01:06:56.596 --> 01:06:58.263
She looks just like you.

01:06:59.766 --> 01:07:01.266
Thank you.

01:07:02.435 --> 01:07:04.879
Well, what do we have?

01:07:04.979 --> 01:07:07.272
You know, before I was selling pieces...

01:07:08.525 --> 01:07:10.025
for cars...

01:07:11.236 --> 01:07:12.846
I was a performer.

01:07:12.946 --> 01:07:15.015
Great time I had,
being on many stages...

01:07:15.115 --> 01:07:17.017
Put it on.

01:07:17.117 --> 01:07:19.311
- Yes? You like it? Okay.
- Yeah.

01:07:19.411 --> 01:07:21.896
Let's make some room.

01:07:23.551 --> 01:07:24.873
Put out the light.

01:07:25.959 --> 01:07:27.960
Turn on the music.

01:08:13.465 --> 01:08:17.176
- <i>Oh, sitting on a bullet</i>
- <i>Oh, sitting on a bullet</i>

01:08:18.636 --> 01:08:20.929
<i>Thinking of power</i>

01:08:22.724 --> 01:08:24.850
<i>Every hour</i>

01:08:28.813 --> 01:08:30.189
Whoo!

01:08:31.232 --> 01:08:33.274
<i>Being in space</i>

01:08:34.861 --> 01:08:37.196
<i>Controlling the world</i>

01:08:38.698 --> 01:08:41.225
<i>With a different face</i>

01:08:41.326 --> 01:08:43.368
<i>Face, face, face</i>

01:08:46.956 --> 01:08:48.692
<i>Berlin</i>

01:08:48.792 --> 01:08:52.752
<i>New York, Moscow</i>

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:55.756
<i>Tokyo</i>

01:08:58.926 --> 01:09:00.886
Well...

01:09:01.888 --> 01:09:04.305
Thank you very much. Long time ago.

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:07.877
Well, tell me something.

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:11.464
How did you boys get so far? To Idaho?

01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:14.050
I only left you in Portland
a couple of days ago, right?

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:16.344
We rode on our trusty motorcycle.

01:09:16.444 --> 01:09:20.305
And what brings you
to this exciting Family Tree Inn?

01:09:20.406 --> 01:09:22.600
- Business.
- Business?

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:24.728
Business.

01:09:24.828 --> 01:09:27.564
What kind of business?

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:31.416
- We're selling motorcycles.
- Okay.

01:09:32.585 --> 01:09:34.779
Let's go down, us...

01:09:34.879 --> 01:09:39.091
for some... business, right?

01:10:34.022 --> 01:10:35.924
Hello.

01:10:36.024 --> 01:10:38.218
You know why I stopped you?

01:10:38.318 --> 01:10:40.402
You was going too fast for this road.

01:10:43.781 --> 01:10:46.476
For going too fast on this road,
I'm gonna give you a ticket.

01:10:46.576 --> 01:10:48.978
A speeding ticket.

01:10:49.078 --> 01:10:51.606
- You like your bike?
- Mm-hmm.

01:10:51.706 --> 01:10:53.665
Well, I'm still gonna give you a ticket.

01:10:55.335 --> 01:10:57.252
What's your name?

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:00.365
- Hans.
- Hans?

01:11:00.465 --> 01:11:01.991
- Kline.
- Kline?

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:03.842
K-L-I...

01:11:05.178 --> 01:11:07.095
Do you have any baggage?

01:11:10.683 --> 01:11:12.184
Hans.

01:11:21.361 --> 01:11:24.029
- Enjoy your flight.
- Thanks.

01:12:36.352 --> 01:12:39.088
Mike! Mike, over here!

01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:56.689
So, what did they want?

01:12:56.789 --> 01:12:59.499
I told them to take care of you
while I got a taxi.

01:13:31.199 --> 01:13:32.699
Mom?

01:13:36.996 --> 01:13:38.514
Scusa.

01:13:40.792 --> 01:13:42.292
Hi.

01:13:44.462 --> 01:13:46.572
Is this your house?

01:13:46.672 --> 01:13:50.410
- What?
- Um...

01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:52.829
la tua casa?

01:13:52.929 --> 01:13:55.748
No, this is my uncle's house...

01:13:55.848 --> 01:13:57.808
but he's not here now.

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:02.437
Oh.

01:14:03.523 --> 01:14:05.967
My name is Scott.

01:14:06.067 --> 01:14:08.177
Scott.

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:11.029
- My name is Carmella.
- How do you do?

01:14:12.782 --> 01:14:14.934
Um, how do you do?

01:14:15.034 --> 01:14:18.036
I... Good.

01:14:19.789 --> 01:14:21.289
Mom?

01:14:25.044 --> 01:14:27.780
An American woman?

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:29.881
Yeah. Do you know her?

01:14:31.384 --> 01:14:32.827
Yeah.

01:14:32.927 --> 01:14:37.347
Um, but is not... is not true
that she lives here.

01:14:39.183 --> 01:14:42.295
- It isn't true?
- No, she...

01:14:42.395 --> 01:14:45.006
She left a long time ago.

01:14:45.106 --> 01:14:47.065
Back to America.

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:49.818
Oh, shit.

01:14:52.088 --> 01:14:54.140
Was she your friend?

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:56.825
Yeah. She lived here, and...

01:14:57.827 --> 01:14:59.729
'cause I wanted to learn English...

01:14:59.829 --> 01:15:03.123
she... she... she taught...
she taught it to me.

01:15:05.543 --> 01:15:07.460
Oh. Well...

01:15:08.796 --> 01:15:10.755
your English is very good.

01:15:12.133 --> 01:15:14.869
Oh, this is my friend.

01:15:14.969 --> 01:15:17.413
- This is Mike.
- Mike.

01:15:17.513 --> 01:15:19.624
- Mike?
- Michael.

01:15:19.724 --> 01:15:21.167
- Hi.
- Carmella.

01:15:21.267 --> 01:15:23.669
- Hi.
- She knows your mom.

01:15:23.769 --> 01:15:25.729
Really? Where?

01:15:27.231 --> 01:15:29.300
No, she...

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:31.302
I'll be right back.

01:15:31.402 --> 01:15:33.320
- Uh, Mike?
- Mom!

01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:10.565
My mom's house was blue.

01:16:14.195 --> 01:16:15.695
No, it was green.

01:16:17.823 --> 01:16:20.351
It was green.

01:16:20.451 --> 01:16:22.369
How could I forget that?

01:16:24.497 --> 01:16:27.999
<i>Da-da, da-da-da, da-dum</i>

01:16:29.919 --> 01:16:34.005
<i>Da-dum, da-da-da, da-da-da</i>

01:17:01.659 --> 01:17:03.936
Thanks for comin'
all this way, though, man.

01:17:04.036 --> 01:17:06.079
I'm ready to leave whenever you are.

01:17:29.729 --> 01:17:31.229
What?

01:18:29.163 --> 01:18:30.106
Grande.

01:18:30.206 --> 01:18:32.149
- Tanta fame?
- Yeah.

01:18:32.249 --> 01:18:34.610
- Tanta fame?
- "Tanta" what?

01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:36.112
- Tanta fame?
- Oh, yeah.

01:18:36.212 --> 01:18:38.698
- You know what "fame" is?
- Hungry.

01:18:38.798 --> 01:18:41.575
- Hungry. Hungry.
- Hungry.

01:18:41.675 --> 01:18:43.802
Sorry.

01:18:50.393 --> 01:18:53.421
Bacio. Bacio.

01:18:53.521 --> 01:18:55.923
- "Bacio"?
- Bacio.

01:18:56.023 --> 01:18:58.066
This is bacio.

01:19:22.133 --> 01:19:23.543
Yeah?

01:20:10.848 --> 01:20:13.042
What is it?

01:20:13.142 --> 01:20:15.143
It's nothing.

01:20:18.314 --> 01:20:20.231
No? Okay.

01:20:21.442 --> 01:20:23.636
- Come on.
- No. Stay, please.

01:20:23.736 --> 01:20:25.904
- All right.
- Look.

01:20:26.739 --> 01:20:28.974
There is a castagna here inside.

01:20:29.074 --> 01:20:31.644
- "La castagna"?
- Castagna.

01:20:31.744 --> 01:20:34.188
Castagna.

01:20:34.288 --> 01:20:36.247
La castagna.

01:20:38.584 --> 01:20:40.543
Know what it's for?

01:20:42.588 --> 01:20:47.159
Eh, if... If they were bigger,
you could eat.

01:20:47.259 --> 01:20:49.427
If they're bigger.

01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:53.457
I understand.

01:20:53.557 --> 01:20:56.267
- Do you?
- Yes.

01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:59.479
I know how you feel.

01:21:05.778 --> 01:21:07.779
I think I fall in love.

01:21:26.048 --> 01:21:28.424
I'm gonna take a little time off.

01:21:31.053 --> 01:21:32.554
You know...

01:21:34.139 --> 01:21:36.599
maybe I'll run into you down the road.

01:21:48.153 --> 01:21:51.030
There's some cash.
That's your share from the bike.

01:21:52.074 --> 01:21:54.033
I fell in love, Mike.

01:21:55.494 --> 01:21:56.995
I'm sorry.

01:21:59.331 --> 01:22:01.499
I'm really sorry
we didn't find your mom.

01:22:23.981 --> 01:22:25.481
Scott.

01:23:35.504 --> 01:23:36.994
What?

01:23:47.898 --> 01:23:50.175
- Tuo fisico.
- "Tuo fisico"?

01:23:50.275 --> 01:23:52.276
Bravo, così.

01:24:32.067 --> 01:24:34.053
Signore. Signore.

01:24:34.153 --> 01:24:38.140
Wake up. We are in the Portland Airport.

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:40.893
We're here. Whoa.

01:24:40.993 --> 01:24:42.952
Whoa.

01:24:45.831 --> 01:24:49.542
Please extinguish cigarettes. Thank you.

01:25:24.745 --> 01:25:26.913
Oh, man. Where were you?

01:25:29.541 --> 01:25:31.042
Forty D's?

01:25:37.216 --> 01:25:39.133
So, how's your wife?

01:25:41.303 --> 01:25:44.597
You're not very talkative tonight, man.
That's cool.

01:25:45.724 --> 01:25:48.168
Where we goin'?

01:25:48.268 --> 01:25:52.089
That should just about do it.
Man alive, there's nothing better...

01:25:52.189 --> 01:25:55.968
than a hamburger grilled to perfection.

01:25:56.068 --> 01:25:58.069
Cool, man.

01:26:01.824 --> 01:26:05.743
Your burgers are getting cold, g...
Holy Moly!

01:27:47.512 --> 01:27:49.456
Bob!

01:27:49.556 --> 01:27:51.583
Hey, Bob.

01:27:51.683 --> 01:27:55.796
¿Qué pasa, man?
I bring great tidings and much joy.

01:27:55.896 --> 01:27:58.298
George, what blew you in?

01:27:58.398 --> 01:28:02.094
Remember that rotgut shit we used to
drink on the streets... the wino wine?

01:28:02.194 --> 01:28:04.904
Well, I got three jugs
hidden in a bush on 82nd.

01:28:05.948 --> 01:28:07.975
We're talkin' hard-core fun, man.

01:28:08.075 --> 01:28:10.936
All we need to do
is put a ride together to the bush...

01:28:11.036 --> 01:28:12.938
and we're in business.

01:28:13.038 --> 01:28:15.315
I'm afraid if I shared your wine...

01:28:15.415 --> 01:28:18.443
I might catch this awful disease
you appear to have.

01:28:18.543 --> 01:28:20.612
My jacket would grow little zippers
all over it...

01:28:20.712 --> 01:28:24.199
and my toes would have jingle bells
on them like those there.

01:28:24.299 --> 01:28:25.784
Bob, chill out.

01:28:25.884 --> 01:28:28.954
Is it true that you're the greatest man
on the street, that you own the street?

01:28:29.054 --> 01:28:30.497
That is correct.

01:28:30.597 --> 01:28:34.918
Well, then you can get us
a ride to see God. Do it.

01:28:35.018 --> 01:28:38.547
If it isn't Scotty Favor himself.

01:28:38.647 --> 01:28:43.844
Dressed in a three-piece suit,
looking every bit a gentleman!

01:28:43.944 --> 01:28:46.096
- Who, man?
- Scott Favor.

01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:49.407
He's run headlong into his inheritance.

01:28:54.746 --> 01:28:57.608
George, Budd...

01:28:57.708 --> 01:28:59.610
Mike.

01:28:59.710 --> 01:29:02.504
We have waited for this day to come.

01:29:15.017 --> 01:29:17.336
Scotty, I haven't seen you
in a dog's age.

01:29:17.436 --> 01:29:19.353
You're lookin' well. So grown up.

01:29:20.147 --> 01:29:22.090
Scotty, I'd like you
to meet Tiger Warren.

01:29:22.190 --> 01:29:24.259
He's with Muchísimo Más restaurants.

01:29:24.359 --> 01:29:26.845
- Tiger, Scotty Favor.
- Jack Favor's son?

01:29:26.945 --> 01:29:29.681
Hello, I'm pleased to meet you.
Awfully sorry about your father.

01:29:29.781 --> 01:29:33.518
It's really all right.
The, uh, family is taking it very hard...

01:29:33.618 --> 01:29:36.647
but we live on with his memory.

01:29:36.747 --> 01:29:39.983
Scott, you ever considered
a political career?

01:29:59.686 --> 01:30:02.089
Come, George. Watch this.

01:30:02.189 --> 01:30:04.299
You'll see the reception that I get.

01:30:04.399 --> 01:30:06.635
Hey, you guys, look at this.

01:30:06.735 --> 01:30:09.763
It's true, we're drawing
attention to ourselves, but...

01:30:09.863 --> 01:30:12.849
Scotty will witness
that I'm dying to see him...

01:30:12.949 --> 01:30:15.602
and it won't matter how we're dressed.

01:30:15.702 --> 01:30:18.788
God save you!
God save you, my sweet boy.

01:30:20.707 --> 01:30:23.167
Scotty, my own true friend!

01:30:26.171 --> 01:30:29.924
I mean you, Scotty. It's me, Bob!

01:30:34.054 --> 01:30:36.514
I don't know you, old man.

01:30:37.933 --> 01:30:39.934
Please leave me alone.

01:30:41.019 --> 01:30:43.463
When I was young
and you were my street tutor...

01:30:43.563 --> 01:30:48.025
an instigator for my bad behavior,
I was planning a change.

01:30:48.735 --> 01:30:51.346
There was a time when I had
the need to learn from you...

01:30:51.446 --> 01:30:55.100
my former and psychedelic teacher.

01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:57.785
And although I love you more dearly
than my dead father...

01:30:58.870 --> 01:31:01.023
I have to turn away.

01:31:01.123 --> 01:31:03.624
Now that I have,
and until I change back...

01:31:05.710 --> 01:31:08.379
don't come near me.

01:31:16.805 --> 01:31:19.624
O-U-T. Out.

01:31:38.326 --> 01:31:39.827
God.

01:31:42.914 --> 01:31:45.082
G-God!

01:31:46.209 --> 01:31:48.127
God?

01:32:12.444 --> 01:32:14.888
Pigeon.

01:32:14.988 --> 01:32:17.364
Scott Favor broke his heart.

01:32:21.356 --> 01:32:23.453
Sure is quiet.

01:32:29.753 --> 01:32:32.739
He's either in heaven or hell now.

01:32:32.839 --> 01:32:35.325
Be sure it isn't to hell.

01:32:35.425 --> 01:32:38.662
He's tried to be an honest sort.

01:32:38.762 --> 01:32:41.957
I'm the one who heard him
cry out last night.

01:32:42.057 --> 01:32:46.670
He said, "God, God, God"...

01:32:46.770 --> 01:32:48.630
three or four times.

01:32:48.730 --> 01:32:54.010
And when I got there, I put my hand
into the bed and felt his feet.

01:32:54.110 --> 01:32:56.221
And they were cold as stones.

01:32:56.321 --> 01:32:58.598
And I checked the rest of his body...

01:32:58.698 --> 01:33:02.660
and it, too, was as cold as stone.

01:33:03.870 --> 01:33:05.772
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son...

01:33:05.872 --> 01:33:08.191
and of the Holy Ghost, amen.

01:33:08.291 --> 01:33:11.027
"'I am the resurrection and the life,'
sayeth the Lord.

01:33:11.127 --> 01:33:15.031
'He that believeth in me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live.

01:33:15.131 --> 01:33:18.201
And whoever liveth
and believeth in me shall never die.'

01:33:18.301 --> 01:33:21.580
Lay not up for yourselves
treasures upon earth...

01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:25.667
where moths and rust do corrupt
and where thieves break through and steal.

01:33:25.767 --> 01:33:28.086
But lay up for yourselves
treasures in heaven...

01:33:28.186 --> 01:33:30.547
where neither moth nor rust corrupt...

01:33:30.647 --> 01:33:33.300
and where thieves do not
break through and steal.

01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:36.553
For where your treasure is,
there shall your heart be also.

01:33:36.653 --> 01:33:38.964
I know that my redeemer liveth...

01:33:39.064 --> 01:33:41.892
Whom I shall see for myself
and mine eyes shall behold.

01:33:41.992 --> 01:33:45.687
Be not deceived. God is not mocked.

01:33:45.787 --> 01:33:49.790
For whatsoever a man soweth,
that shall he also reap.

01:33:51.001 --> 01:33:55.822
<i>Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob
Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob</i>

01:33:55.922 --> 01:33:58.909
<i>Bob-Bob-Bob</i>

01:33:59.009 --> 01:34:02.245
<i>Bob, Bob, Bob
Bob, Bob, Bob</i>

01:34:02.345 --> 01:34:04.789
<i>Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob</i>

01:34:04.889 --> 01:34:07.334
<i>Bob, Bob, Bob</i>

01:34:07.434 --> 01:34:11.755
For he that soweth to his flesh,
shall of the flesh reap corruption.

01:34:11.855 --> 01:34:13.965
<i>Bob, Bob-Bob</i>

01:34:24.743 --> 01:34:27.812
Bob!

01:34:30.248 --> 01:34:34.027
Bob! Bob! Bob!

01:34:34.127 --> 01:34:37.030
But he that soweth to the Spirit
shall of the Spirit...

01:34:37.130 --> 01:34:39.282
reap life everlasting.

01:34:39.382 --> 01:34:42.077
And let us not be weary in well-doing,
for in due season...

01:34:42.177 --> 01:34:44.762
Bob! Bob! Bob!

01:34:59.861 --> 01:35:02.555
And their going from us
to be utter destruction."

01:35:07.619 --> 01:35:10.855
Bob! Bob! Bob!

01:35:15.251 --> 01:35:17.503
George!

01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:49.019
I'm a connoisseur of roads.

01:35:52.163 --> 01:35:55.457
Been tasting roads my whole life.

01:35:58.545 --> 01:36:00.045
This road...

01:36:01.089 --> 01:36:03.006
will never end.

01:36:07.345 --> 01:36:09.289
It probably goes...

01:36:09.389 --> 01:36:12.349
all around...

01:36:14.018 --> 01:36:15.936
the world.

01:39:27.638 --> 01:39:31.324
<i>When I first came to London</i>

01:39:31.424 --> 01:39:34.285
<i>I was only 16</i>

01:39:34.385 --> 01:39:37.205
<i>With a fiver in my pocket</i>

01:39:37.305 --> 01:39:40.208
<i>And my old dancing bag</i>

01:39:40.308 --> 01:39:43.127
<i>I went down to the dilly</i>

01:39:43.227 --> 01:39:46.047
<i>To check out the scene</i>

01:39:46.147 --> 01:39:51.886
<i>But I soon ended up
upon the old main drag</i>

01:39:51.986 --> 01:39:54.847
<i>Where the he-males and the she-males</i>

01:39:54.947 --> 01:39:57.767
<i>Paraded in style</i>

01:39:57.867 --> 01:40:03.690
<i>And the old man with the money
would flash you a smile</i>

01:40:03.790 --> 01:40:09.529
<i>In the dark of an alley
you would work for a five</i>

01:40:09.629 --> 01:40:15.368
<i>For a swift one off the wrist
down on the old main drag</i>

01:40:15.468 --> 01:40:21.249
<i>In the cold winter nights
the old town it was chill</i>

01:40:21.349 --> 01:40:23.876
<i>But there were boys in the cafés</i>

01:40:23.976 --> 01:40:26.546
<i>Who'd give you cheap pills</i>

01:40:26.646 --> 01:40:29.424
<i>If you didn't have the money</i>

01:40:29.524 --> 01:40:32.343
<i>You'd cajole and you'd beg</i>

01:40:32.443 --> 01:40:35.346
<i>There was always lots of Tuinal</i>

01:40:35.446 --> 01:40:38.281
<i>On the old main drag</i>

01:40:49.711 --> 01:40:52.864
<i>One evening as I was lying</i>

01:40:52.964 --> 01:40:56.034
<i>Down in Leicester Square</i>

01:40:56.134 --> 01:40:58.786
<i>I was picked up by the coppers</i>

01:40:58.886 --> 01:41:01.456
<i>And kicked in the balls</i>

01:41:01.556 --> 01:41:04.667
<i>Between the metal doors at Vine Street</i>

01:41:04.767 --> 01:41:08.004
<i>I was beaten and mauled</i>

01:41:08.104 --> 01:41:10.381
<i>And they ruined my good looks</i>

01:41:10.481 --> 01:41:13.301
<i>For the old main drag</i>

01:41:13.401 --> 01:41:15.136
<i>In the tube station</i>

01:41:15.236 --> 01:41:19.182
<i>The old ones who were on the way out</i>

01:41:19.282 --> 01:41:21.893
<i>Would dribble and vomit</i>

01:41:21.993 --> 01:41:25.063
<i>And grovel and shout</i>

01:41:25.163 --> 01:41:28.441
<i>And the coppers would come along</i>

01:41:28.541 --> 01:41:30.818
<i>And push them about</i>

01:41:30.918 --> 01:41:33.905
<i>And I wished I could escape from</i>

01:41:34.005 --> 01:41:36.866
<i>The old main drag</i>

01:41:36.966 --> 01:41:39.702
<i>And now I am lying here</i>

01:41:39.802 --> 01:41:42.372
<i>I have had too much booze</i>

01:41:42.472 --> 01:41:45.333
<i>I've been spat on and shat on</i>

01:41:45.433 --> 01:41:48.795
<i>And raped and abused</i>

01:41:48.895 --> 01:41:54.050
<i>I know that I am dying
and I wish I could beg</i>

01:41:54.150 --> 01:41:59.154
<i>For some money to take me
from the old main drag</i>

01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:49.814
<i>Deep night</i>

01:42:49.914 --> 01:42:54.610
<i>Stars in the sky above</i>

01:42:54.710 --> 01:42:58.239
<i>Moonlight</i>

01:42:58.339 --> 01:43:03.286
<i>Lighting our place of love</i>

01:43:03.386 --> 01:43:06.622
<i>Night winds</i>

01:43:06.722 --> 01:43:11.502
<i>Seem to have gone to rest</i>

01:43:11.602 --> 01:43:14.797
<i>Two eyes</i>

01:43:14.897 --> 01:43:18.885
<i>Brightly with love are gleaming</i>

01:43:18.985 --> 01:43:22.847
<i>Come to my arms, my dear one</i>

01:43:22.947 --> 01:43:27.477
<i>My sweetheart, my own</i>

01:43:27.577 --> 01:43:31.481
<i>Vow that you'll love me always</i>

01:43:31.581 --> 01:43:36.694
<i>And be mine alone</i>

01:43:36.794 --> 01:43:39.989
<i>Deep night</i>

01:43:40.089 --> 01:43:44.577
<i>Whispering trees above</i>

01:43:44.677 --> 01:43:48.372
<i>Kind night</i>

01:43:48.472 --> 01:43:52.210
<i>Bringing you nearer, dearer and dearer</i>

01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:56.756
<i>Deep night</i>

01:43:56.856 --> 01:43:58.883
<i>Deep in the arms</i>

01:43:58.983 --> 01:44:03.904
<i>Of love</i>

01:44:04.305 --> 01:44:10.431
