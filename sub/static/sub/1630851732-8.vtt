WEBVTT

00:32.073 --> 00:33.325
He watches over you.

00:37.871 --> 00:38.997
Your home awaits.

01:00.435 --> 01:01.270
Fuck.

01:01.353 --> 01:03.772
Sir! Sir!

01:03.856 --> 01:05.649
-Sergeant, he wouldn't stop.
-Hey!

01:05.732 --> 01:07.943
SOC Trevante Cole, US Navy SEAL.

01:08.026 --> 01:11.071
I need your first plane back to America.
DC, Virginia, whatever the fuck you got.

01:11.154 --> 01:12.948
-Okay?
-Chief, there is no next plane.

01:13.031 --> 01:15.284
This is an air base, an airfield.
What the fuck you talking about?

01:15.367 --> 01:16.827
It is here for the defense
of these people.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.705
We certainly aren't flying anyone
or anything to the US.

01:19.788 --> 01:22.165
Fine. I'll get on a commercial. Private.
Just whatever you got.

01:22.249 --> 01:24.459
I don't think you comprehend.
No one's flying to the US.

01:24.543 --> 01:26.712
There's no longer any operating
air traffic control system.

01:26.795 --> 01:27.796
We just got here, sir.

01:27.880 --> 01:30.465
And we've grounded you.
You're one of the lucky few.

01:30.549 --> 01:32.801
We've lost more aircraft
than I care to count.

01:32.885 --> 01:34.303
A bloody good number over the Atlantic.

01:34.386 --> 01:36.889
Just get me a pilot, a plane
or a fucking manual is all I'm asking.

01:36.972 --> 01:39.349
No one is leaving here.
Not in the air and not on the ground.

01:39.433 --> 01:42.477
We have no planes, no transports, Chief.

01:42.561 --> 01:45.230
-Sergeant, show him out.
-Don't fucking touch me.

01:45.314 --> 01:47.441
Hey! Listen, I got a wife.

01:48.775 --> 01:49.985
And she's waiting for me, okay?

01:50.068 --> 01:51.445
-Sir.
-Please. I made a promise to her.

01:51.528 --> 01:54.448
I've already come halfway across
the world, and I'm not stopping now, okay?

01:54.531 --> 01:55.699
I made a promise.

01:55.782 --> 01:58.076
And I'm not about to let
some tight-ass British motherfucker

01:58.160 --> 02:00.495
like you or him
get in the way of that happening.

02:00.579 --> 02:02.331
Do you comprehend that, sir?

02:04.875 --> 02:06.001
Airman, tell our gunners

02:06.084 --> 02:08.877
that Chief Cole here is clear
to leave the perimeter as he wishes.

02:10.047 --> 02:11.298
We will allow him his sidearm,

02:11.381 --> 02:14.635
and we wish him Godspeed on his journey
to cross the Atlantic Ocean.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.262
May he find a worthy sailboat.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.764
Hey, Luke.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.392
You got a special mom here.

03:46.435 --> 03:48.187
He's a lot more special than I am.

03:49.313 --> 03:51.273
Can I go? I don't wanna eat this.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.233
You need to eat something.

03:53.317 --> 03:54.943
Can I please just go?

03:55.027 --> 03:56.737
-Where would you go?
-To Dad.

03:57.863 --> 04:00.449
Okay. You will go right to him.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.534
Mom, he's literally right there.

04:02.618 --> 04:03.952
Right to him.

04:04.036 --> 04:05.078
I will.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.542
Hey, hey, hey.

04:10.626 --> 04:13.795
Take your backpack
and keep it with you. Okay?

04:15.547 --> 04:16.714
Take your food.

04:23.430 --> 04:24.723
You're a good mom.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.684
I don't know. I try.

04:29.728 --> 04:31.355
I didn't know you had a family.

04:32.481 --> 04:33.815
I have them.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.068
Yeah.

04:37.402 --> 04:38.654
I had a family.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.199
I'm sorry.

04:42.699 --> 04:46.578
No… No, no, not from this.

04:49.414 --> 04:51.708
It's been a few years.
Nothing happened, just…

04:53.293 --> 04:55.629
Highest rates among doctors and all.

04:57.256 --> 04:58.298
Highest rates?

04:59.591 --> 05:00.759
Divorce.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.596
We made sense when we started.

05:05.097 --> 05:07.224
Then things changed.

05:09.476 --> 05:10.727
Or maybe I did.

05:13.188 --> 05:14.565
I know what you mean.

05:18.694 --> 05:20.445
I'm happy you found this place.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.740
I mean, we need you here.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.285
Doctor, you are smart.

05:26.869 --> 05:30.873
You're skilled. You're instinctive.
We're all just making it up as we go.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.002
Hey.

05:36.503 --> 05:37.754
Can I show you something?

05:57.149 --> 05:59.484
Hey.

06:00.152 --> 06:01.278
I'm Jack.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.362
Luke.

06:03.155 --> 06:04.865
Wanna see something cool, Luke?

06:06.533 --> 06:09.411
I mean, scary cool, but cool.

06:10.746 --> 06:13.457
It's the part of the place
they don't want us to see.

06:21.507 --> 06:23.717
They're lying to you.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.471
Whatever they've told you.

06:28.138 --> 06:29.973
If you don't free me,
if you don't help me,

06:29.973 --> 06:32.476
the whole world will die.

06:32.726 --> 06:36.480
Everyone you care about will die.

06:36.855 --> 06:38.857
You hear me?

06:42.903 --> 06:45.113
What's your name?

06:48.242 --> 06:50.494
Coward.

07:43.714 --> 07:45.841
How many times do I need to tell you to…

07:45.966 --> 07:47.092
are you stupid?

07:47.676 --> 07:48.552
Give us the room.

07:48.719 --> 07:49.595
Please.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.227
…You?

07:57.436 --> 07:59.188
I didn't have a choice.

07:59.188 --> 08:02.065
We need immediate access
to the Hoshi-12 communications system.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.692
I was seconds from contact!

08:03.692 --> 08:04.651
You stopped me --

08:04.651 --> 08:06.445
We have fixed coordinates.

08:06.445 --> 08:07.529
They're locked on.

08:07.529 --> 08:08.780
We need access.

08:09.114 --> 08:10.240
"Fixed coordinates"?

08:10.949 --> 08:12.951
It's in geo-sync orbit.

08:16.330 --> 08:19.166
It's being held.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.252
By them.

08:25.797 --> 08:28.091
It's the only contact.

08:28.800 --> 08:32.260
The Hoshi-12 is the only
communications channel we have up there.

08:32.346 --> 08:34.681
What's left of the Hoshi-12.

08:34.972 --> 08:36.933
I won't give them anything.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.019
She's gone.

08:40.395 --> 08:41.563
Please.

08:41.563 --> 08:43.148
Don't do this to yourself.

08:43.232 --> 08:45.150
The Hoshi mission is over.

08:45.943 --> 08:47.611
This is something else now.

08:47.611 --> 08:48.862
To you maybe.

08:48.946 --> 08:51.365
This is bigger than us.

08:52.699 --> 08:55.160
There may be nobody left to save.

08:55.869 --> 09:00.165
Tell them I'm the only chance
they have at making contact.

09:00.249 --> 09:02.000
They know that--

09:02.084 --> 09:04.419
And I'm only helping…

09:04.419 --> 09:06.505
if I'm the one making contact.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.843
I don't think you're in a position
to negotiate.

09:10.843 --> 09:12.386
I don't think you have any other choice.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.514
Tell them.

09:24.857 --> 09:26.942
She'll run the comms team.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.028
Unless you want

09:30.028 --> 09:34.575
to waste six hours tripping the security
lockout protocols she's installed.

09:34.658 --> 09:36.743
Then let's move.

09:42.457 --> 09:43.709
Bring her team in.

09:44.376 --> 09:45.961
"Lockout protocols"?

09:46.545 --> 09:49.464
Like you said. We need you.

09:55.554 --> 09:56.930
This is how it always is.

10:23.373 --> 10:24.708
Is-- Is that Dettol?

10:35.844 --> 10:43.185
Mum?

12:57.903 --> 13:47.828
Oh, shit.

13:49.955 --> 13:51.123
Come on. Fu--

14:25.699 --> 14:26.700
Okay.

14:43.467 --> 14:46.637
Come on. Fuck it. Come on.
Work, work, work. Come on, work.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.013
You worked before. Come on.

14:49.306 --> 14:50.807
Okay. Fucking work.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.143
Work.

14:55.354 --> 14:57.272
It should work. Work.

14:59.066 --> 15:05.322
421-6274.

15:12.329 --> 15:15.707
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

15:18.335 --> 15:19.336
Pick up.

15:27.052 --> 15:30.722
-Hey.
-Rah! Hey! It's Trev. Rah! Hello?

15:30.806 --> 15:33.100
I don't even know
if you're gonna hear this…

15:34.101 --> 15:37.312
But I don't have cell,
and this is the only landline I know, so…

15:40.065 --> 15:42.067
I guess you know there's no work anymore.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.529
Everyone's hiding. Everyone's running.

15:48.323 --> 15:51.285
But maybe you'll call here anyway.

15:55.414 --> 15:57.666
They're making us all leave. It's bad.

15:59.626 --> 16:03.046
I don't know what's gonna happen
or where I'll be, so…

16:05.299 --> 16:06.884
I can't promise I'm not scared.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.096
I know you're worried.

16:11.180 --> 16:12.681
I know you are, 'cause you worry a lot

16:12.764 --> 16:14.183
even when you're not here.

16:15.350 --> 16:16.518
And that's okay.

16:18.228 --> 16:20.856
I worry about you too.
I'm always worried about you.

16:28.906 --> 16:30.115
-Trev?
-Yeah?

16:33.327 --> 16:36.997
This is a war we can't win.

16:40.459 --> 16:42.085
And I'm not mad at you.

16:44.505 --> 16:46.882
I'm mad at what happened to us.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.301
Because I didn't do that.

16:50.260 --> 16:51.595
You didn't do that.

16:53.222 --> 16:55.307
And there was nothing you could do,
except…

16:57.559 --> 16:59.228
except maybe be here with me.

17:02.272 --> 17:05.442
And I know why you aren't. I know.

17:07.361 --> 17:09.530
And like I said, I'm not mad, I…

17:12.824 --> 17:14.867
Maybe I am. Maybe I am mad.

17:17.579 --> 17:19.248
I'm mad because I love you.

17:21.750 --> 17:23.627
I will always love you.

17:26.002 --> 17:27.881
And I will always love him.

17:28.632 --> 17:29.633
Me too.

17:31.301 --> 17:33.220
Love doesn't die, Trev.

17:34.513 --> 17:36.265
People do sometimes.

17:38.559 --> 17:39.726
And I guess…

17:53.991 --> 17:55.242
I'm in London.

17:57.411 --> 18:00.163
I'm in London. I mean,
I don't really know where I am. I…

18:01.999 --> 18:03.834
I don't know where I'm going. I'm just…

18:17.055 --> 18:18.182
I love him.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.351
I love him too.

18:23.270 --> 18:24.813
I can't stop loving him.

18:27.149 --> 18:33.614
It hurts.

18:38.118 --> 18:39.411
And I'm scared.

18:40.996 --> 18:42.039
I'm scared.

18:49.129 --> 18:50.714
There's no planes, Rah.

18:52.174 --> 18:55.761
No people, just-- just nothing.
The world's over.

18:57.012 --> 18:58.013
It's…

18:59.264 --> 19:00.849
Now it's just me and you.

19:12.319 --> 19:15.364
I want you to know that I'm--
I'm there with you.

19:17.157 --> 19:20.035
I'm holding you. I'm touching you.

19:23.288 --> 19:24.998
I'm telling you that I love you.

19:26.208 --> 19:27.292
I'm telling you I love you

19:27.376 --> 19:29.711
when you're yelling at me
in the kitchen under the light,

19:29.795 --> 19:32.297
throwing all types of shit at me
'cause you're mad.

19:32.798 --> 19:33.799
Right?

19:35.092 --> 19:36.510
And that's okay.

19:36.593 --> 19:37.594
You're-- That's okay.

19:37.678 --> 19:40.639
Because I'm telling you that I'm sorry,
and that I mean it this time.

19:40.722 --> 19:41.974
And maybe you'll…

19:44.059 --> 19:46.061
And maybe you'll give me another chance.

19:52.401 --> 19:53.944
And I'm holding you, you know.

19:55.946 --> 19:57.531
And I'm telling you I love you.

20:01.076 --> 20:02.244
I love you.

20:06.957 --> 20:09.543
I love you. I love you.

20:11.795 --> 20:13.046
I really love you.

21:13.899 --> 21:16.026
Don't be scared, baby. I'm here.

21:18.111 --> 21:20.572
You remember
when you used to have scary dreams

21:21.949 --> 21:23.909
and you'd sleep with me and Mommy?

21:25.702 --> 21:27.120
Remember what I told you?

21:28.038 --> 21:29.248
That dreams aren't real.

21:30.624 --> 21:32.626
It's just like watching movies
in your head.

21:32.709 --> 21:33.752
Yes.

21:34.419 --> 21:38.090
And I sang you our song
and then you'd fall asleep,

21:39.132 --> 21:41.218
and then you'd wake up in your own bed.

21:42.261 --> 21:45.848
And you stopped having those bad dreams,
right?

21:47.891 --> 21:50.352
So you don't have to be afraid
of falling asleep.

21:51.228 --> 21:54.106
I'm not afraid of falling asleep anymore.

21:57.985 --> 21:59.862
I'm afraid of staying awake.

22:03.240 --> 22:04.449
Where's Mommy?

22:06.785 --> 22:08.287
She went with Luke.

22:09.329 --> 22:10.497
Just to eat.

22:12.040 --> 22:14.418
-She's safe?
-She's here. Yeah.

22:15.127 --> 22:16.712
She's here, and we're here.

22:17.963 --> 22:19.381
We're all together here.

22:23.594 --> 22:26.305
Military's taken most of the useful stuff.

22:27.222 --> 22:30.017
We had to race out of there.
Up here, we got no real equipment.

22:30.851 --> 22:35.564
If anything else happens,
another attack happens, we're left with…

22:35.647 --> 22:37.941
Antiseptics and Band-Aids.

22:39.067 --> 22:40.861
We need people who can improvise now.

22:42.196 --> 22:43.488
I think that's you.

22:44.281 --> 22:45.324
You think?

22:46.366 --> 22:47.367
I know.

22:48.869 --> 22:50.621
How do you know so much about me?

22:52.664 --> 22:54.124
I know you're a survivor.

22:55.209 --> 22:57.920
I know you're good with your hands.

22:58.879 --> 23:00.255
I know you're a good mom.

23:01.798 --> 23:03.592
I know you're not wearing your ring.

23:06.428 --> 23:07.596
Are you okay?

23:40.170 --> 23:42.130
Sorry. I'm sorry.

23:42.965 --> 23:44.550
Did you see a woman and a boy in here?

23:46.009 --> 23:48.011
A lot of people fit that description.

23:48.095 --> 23:53.225
Oh, yeah. He's-- he's ten,
and she-- she'll look like us.

23:55.394 --> 23:56.937
They with another guy?

23:58.522 --> 23:59.523
Maybe.

24:00.440 --> 24:02.276
The boy left that way.

24:02.359 --> 24:04.194
I didn't see where the other two went.

24:04.820 --> 24:06.697
-Daddy?
-Yeah? Yeah, baby?

24:07.322 --> 24:08.490
All right, thanks.

24:09.324 --> 24:10.576
Okay, baby.

24:22.754 --> 24:23.964
I'm sorry.

24:25.174 --> 24:26.592
-I'm sorry. I shouldn't--
-Don't.

24:27.092 --> 24:29.261
Think I just got overwhelmed and…

24:29.344 --> 24:30.470
That was nice.

24:31.096 --> 24:33.515
I haven't been kissed like that
in a long time.

24:33.599 --> 24:34.600
Yeah.

24:35.475 --> 24:37.936
I haven't kissed anyone like that
in a long time.

24:39.563 --> 24:40.564
You're a…

24:42.149 --> 24:43.692
You're a very good doctor.

24:46.028 --> 24:47.404
I'm not a doctor.

24:47.988 --> 24:50.115
I mean, I was going to be.

24:50.699 --> 24:53.869
I went to med school, but I'm a mom.

24:55.913 --> 24:57.080
I'm a mom.

24:59.249 --> 25:01.293
You're a mom
who saved your family's lives.

25:01.376 --> 25:03.921
You got them here on your own.

25:04.630 --> 25:05.797
It wasn't me.

25:08.175 --> 25:09.593
We would've died without it.

25:11.803 --> 25:13.096
Without what?

25:26.235 --> 25:27.236
See?

25:28.362 --> 25:29.488
It's cool, right?

25:30.405 --> 25:32.032
The aliens kill them…

25:33.242 --> 25:35.244
and then they put that stuff on them.

25:35.869 --> 25:39.998
My dad says
the aliens are gonna kill everyone.

25:41.124 --> 25:44.878
Guns don't work on them.
Nothing works on them.

25:49.633 --> 25:50.884
My mom killed one.

25:52.469 --> 25:53.512
You're lying.

25:54.346 --> 25:55.389
I'm not.

25:56.557 --> 25:58.809
No way. How?

25:59.601 --> 26:01.144
How could she kill one?

26:05.649 --> 26:06.692
We got no time.

26:06.775 --> 26:08.861
We need to learn their language.

26:08.944 --> 26:11.196
We need to talk to them
so they understand us.

26:11.280 --> 26:13.490
And we need
that shuttle comms channel to do it.

26:17.411 --> 26:20.747
We might be all that stands
between life as we know it

26:20.831 --> 26:22.291
and the end of all existence.

26:24.459 --> 26:25.460
Does she speak English?

26:26.545 --> 26:27.462
Japanese.

26:27.796 --> 26:28.547
Fujimoto-san,

26:29.631 --> 26:31.008
I need to transmit from the terminal.

26:40.934 --> 26:42.436
Tell me what she's doing.

26:42.519 --> 26:43.896
Tell me what you're doing.

26:44.688 --> 26:46.023
Can you please tell me what you are doing?

26:46.023 --> 26:46.607
He demands to know.

26:46.690 --> 26:47.858
I'm sending a command.

26:48.108 --> 26:50.319
To open the shuttle comms channel.

26:50.694 --> 26:51.737
Or…

26:51.737 --> 26:53.947
do you prefer being locked out?

27:00.704 --> 27:01.538
Hopefully,

27:01.622 --> 27:04.082
we understand them better
than we understand each other.

27:06.752 --> 27:08.462
Shuttle comms are open.

27:13.300 --> 27:16.011
They can hear us now.

27:42.663 --> 27:44.081
Tell me about your mum.

27:47.251 --> 27:48.585
I wanna meet her.

28:12.192 --> 28:13.527
She couldn't stand.

28:18.574 --> 28:19.616
But…

28:20.450 --> 28:24.413
It was like she was always taller
than everyone else, you know?

28:26.164 --> 28:27.165
Yeah.

28:35.215 --> 28:36.675
She would…

28:38.635 --> 28:41.513
She would never tell me if I messed up.

28:46.602 --> 28:47.936
I messed up a lot.

28:50.105 --> 28:51.273
All the time.

29:00.240 --> 29:04.161
She would buy dresses from the '60s.

29:12.503 --> 29:14.087
She'd listen to Kate Bush.

29:16.673 --> 29:17.799
Cyndi Lauper.

29:18.759 --> 29:20.719
DEVO. And they're all really annoying.

29:21.970 --> 29:23.680
We used to fight about it.

29:27.893 --> 29:30.437
She's right. Kate Bush is ace.

29:31.480 --> 29:32.481
Really?

29:32.564 --> 29:33.565
Nuh-uh.

29:34.191 --> 29:35.901
God, she'd like you.

29:37.152 --> 29:38.278
I like her.

29:44.076 --> 29:45.077
Me too.

29:56.880 --> 29:58.131
If I was here…

30:01.969 --> 30:03.470
-I would've killed it.
-You couldn't.

30:04.096 --> 30:05.389
Yes, I could.

30:07.975 --> 30:09.226
I know I could.

30:10.978 --> 30:13.272
I know I could like I know
we're gonna go and find your mum.

30:13.355 --> 30:14.982
You don't know where my mum is.

30:15.065 --> 30:16.233
Yes, I do. Okay.

30:16.316 --> 30:19.403
She's at the hospital where she works.
Like you said.

30:20.612 --> 30:22.030
We have to go there.

30:22.114 --> 30:23.240
-Why?
-I have to go.

30:23.323 --> 30:24.324
-Okay?
-Why, Casp?

30:24.408 --> 30:28.078
I have to go there
because I could've done something. Okay?

30:29.705 --> 30:30.914
I could've stopped it.

30:35.210 --> 30:36.336
I still can.

30:40.924 --> 30:42.176
I think I can.

30:42.259 --> 30:43.260
Casp.

30:44.052 --> 30:45.888
What could you do?

30:57.316 --> 30:59.818
I saw them. That satellite and this.

31:01.195 --> 31:02.196
What is this?

31:02.279 --> 31:04.865
I don't just see it when it happens, okay?

31:04.948 --> 31:06.325
I taste it. I breathe it.

31:06.408 --> 31:10.454
I feel it closing in on me, you know?
Like… It's-- It's dark.

31:10.537 --> 31:11.872
And whenever it happens,

31:11.955 --> 31:15.334
it's like something else
behind the darkness, moving.

31:16.835 --> 31:17.836
I ran from it.

31:17.920 --> 31:19.254
I've been running from it.

31:20.130 --> 31:21.340
And then it came here.

31:22.090 --> 31:23.717
I'm not gonna run from it anymore.

31:24.218 --> 31:25.344
No more meds.

31:27.930 --> 31:28.972
I need to talk to it.

31:30.307 --> 31:31.433
"Talk to it"?

31:33.268 --> 31:34.811
Look, I can.

31:34.895 --> 31:35.979
I know I can.

31:36.939 --> 31:38.649
I-- If I…

31:39.316 --> 31:40.567
Have a seizure.

31:41.151 --> 31:42.152
Yeah.

31:43.320 --> 31:44.321
One that doesn't stop.

31:44.404 --> 31:46.448
You can't make that happen.

31:46.532 --> 31:47.699
The hospital can.

31:50.327 --> 31:51.703
They killed my mum.

31:51.787 --> 31:53.163
So, you're gonna kill them?

31:55.040 --> 31:56.458
-How?
-I don't know.

31:56.542 --> 32:00.921
Okay? But I will. I will. I know it.
I feel it. I've been feeling it.

32:03.340 --> 32:04.633
And now I know.

32:07.386 --> 32:09.596
It's me against them.

32:15.853 --> 32:16.937
You coming?

32:19.565 --> 32:21.233
Does the queen shit in heels?

32:25.112 --> 32:26.154
Let's kill 'em all.

32:42.671 --> 32:54.266
Can you respond?

32:57.811 --> 33:00.522
Recursiveness is the foundation
of all speech.

33:01.148 --> 33:03.650
We won't be able to talk to them
unless we can decipher their rules.

33:03.734 --> 33:06.445
We need that to find a shared meaning.

33:06.528 --> 33:08.405
Can't just choose words.

33:10.365 --> 33:12.159
All they ever do is fight.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.336
I could help, if I knew what it was…

33:23.212 --> 33:27.799
Training parallel neural nets
using live input

33:27.799 --> 33:30.844
to approximate the signal data format,

33:30.844 --> 33:34.890
so we can encode any data format back.

33:37.100 --> 33:38.227
…right.

33:38.727 --> 33:40.646
Machine translation?

33:41.063 --> 33:43.857
They've sent entire dictionaries.

33:43.857 --> 33:46.610
And no change in signal.

33:46.610 --> 33:48.529
No matter what we send.

33:48.529 --> 33:51.532
No response
from what's holding that shuttle.

33:52.241 --> 33:54.743
Or the crew.

34:05.337 --> 34:11.802
You told Hashimoto before you told me.

34:11.802 --> 34:13.887
About you…

34:13.887 --> 34:16.681
and…her.

34:19.226 --> 34:21.186
Should I have told you?

34:22.771 --> 34:24.648
Well…

34:25.607 --> 34:27.525
You don't own any part of me.

34:28.652 --> 34:30.487
No one does.

34:30.946 --> 34:32.906
Not you.

34:32.906 --> 34:34.074
Not my mother.

34:34.074 --> 34:35.659
Not my father.

34:36.909 --> 34:38.704
Not JASA.

34:45.543 --> 34:47.420
Only her.

35:03.103 --> 35:05.189
We all have someone…

35:05.189 --> 35:07.983
we care about more than anyone else.

35:10.402 --> 35:13.697
I have you.

35:22.998 --> 35:25.459
I don't understand it.

35:26.752 --> 35:29.254
That's because it's my language.

35:30.422 --> 35:32.883
Maybe they'll speak it.

35:38.722 --> 35:41.266
It's like another mile to the hospital
if we just cut across.

35:46.772 --> 35:48.690
There's one of them.

35:48.774 --> 35:49.900
No. We can't stop.

35:49.983 --> 35:51.193
Come here.

35:56.490 --> 35:57.533
Hey.

35:59.076 --> 36:00.619
Help. Help us.

36:01.912 --> 36:03.247
Hey, you're a soldier.

36:03.747 --> 36:04.748
Help us.

36:17.219 --> 36:18.637
I'm an operator, kid.

36:19.388 --> 36:23.100
Soldiers are-- Never mind.

36:24.017 --> 36:25.102
Sir.

36:28.605 --> 36:30.774
I need to get to the hospital. Now.

36:31.650 --> 36:33.527
No. I'm not going
to another fucking hospital

36:33.610 --> 36:34.820
as long as I fucking live.

36:35.362 --> 36:37.406
Okay? And hopefully
that's not too long from now.

36:42.494 --> 36:43.620
-Get outta here.
-No.

36:46.456 --> 36:47.541
Fuck him.

36:49.626 --> 36:50.627
Wait.

36:52.713 --> 36:55.674
I said,
"I need to get to the hospital, now."

36:57.301 --> 36:59.803
-Do you see what's happening out there?
-I've seen some shit, kid,

36:59.887 --> 37:01.471
that you have no idea about.

37:05.809 --> 37:06.935
I've seen more than you.

37:10.314 --> 37:11.481
Seen more than me?

37:12.900 --> 37:14.109
"I've seen more than you."

37:14.193 --> 37:17.446
Come on, come on. All right, yeah?
Yeah? You've seen more than me?

37:22.492 --> 37:23.827
Fuck you seen?

37:26.121 --> 37:27.289
I saw them.

37:28.290 --> 37:30.542
But I saw them before they even got here.

37:31.793 --> 37:34.213
I saw things that could've stopped them.

37:36.340 --> 37:37.841
In my head, all right.

37:38.967 --> 37:42.804
I need to get to the hospital.
You're a soldier and you can take us.

37:43.889 --> 37:45.349
-Operator.
-Operator.

37:45.432 --> 37:47.059
Same thing.

37:52.814 --> 37:53.815
Look.

37:56.652 --> 37:58.987
It's nice. It's cute. Nice coloring book.

37:59.071 --> 38:00.364
I said, "Look."

38:03.200 --> 38:06.203
Aren't you guys supposed to be
in school or some shit? Jesus.

38:09.122 --> 38:10.457
What am I looking for?

38:10.541 --> 38:12.334
This is nice. Cute.

38:13.210 --> 38:14.211
Cool.

38:25.597 --> 38:26.598
What's that?

38:27.307 --> 38:28.475
I told you.

38:29.017 --> 38:31.019
When I seize, I see.

38:31.103 --> 38:32.396
Yeah, but what's that?

38:32.479 --> 38:34.648
I don't know. I just saw it.

38:35.732 --> 38:37.025
Saw it how?

38:37.109 --> 38:40.112
I see things when I seizure, okay?

38:41.947 --> 38:47.536
And sometimes, my seizures,
they're big, really big. Things like--

38:47.619 --> 38:50.497
-And when did you do this?
-Three or four days ago.

38:52.624 --> 38:53.792
On the bus that night.

38:55.377 --> 38:59.006
It was soldiers. Just shapes.

38:59.882 --> 39:02.509
And then they were gone. That's all.

39:13.937 --> 39:16.148
You gonna stare at pictures
or you gonna help us?

39:22.154 --> 39:23.155
All right.

39:24.156 --> 39:26.408
All right, let's go. Come on.

39:26.491 --> 39:28.243
Come on, let's go.
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

39:42.758 --> 39:45.177
-I'm sure they're with him.
-I'm sorry. I can't.

39:45.260 --> 39:46.261
Angela.

39:54.853 --> 39:55.854
Luke!

40:09.576 --> 40:10.786
I thought I lost you.

40:13.747 --> 40:14.831
You stay back.

40:15.332 --> 40:16.458
Is he yours?

40:19.711 --> 40:20.712
Luke?

40:22.047 --> 40:23.173
Luke.

40:41.316 --> 40:44.069
One A is showing
the same defensive response.

40:44.152 --> 40:46.280
Closing and hardening with contact.

40:46.363 --> 40:48.615
No. No progress on communication.

40:50.200 --> 40:51.910
-Sir, yes, sir.
-Pressure still increasing.

40:52.494 --> 40:56.456
2.1. Still increasing. Point two.

40:57.291 --> 40:58.709
-Understood.
-No reaction.

41:00.252 --> 41:01.587
Point three.

41:01.670 --> 41:03.463
No, sir. I won't tell anyone.

41:03.547 --> 41:05.382
-Same as the others.
-Understood.

41:05.883 --> 41:07.050
Thank you, sir.

41:09.803 --> 41:10.804
Keeps growing.

41:32.534 --> 41:35.412
Los Angeles has gone dark.

41:38.081 --> 41:39.166
Yamato-san.

41:39.917 --> 41:43.879
Your job is only to keep signals open.

41:44.880 --> 41:46.840
You've done that.

41:47.424 --> 41:49.843
Let the linguists work.

41:50.177 --> 41:54.306
They'll never figure out their language.

41:55.098 --> 41:56.808
They don't have a language.

41:57.893 --> 42:01.021
Not like ours.

42:01.688 --> 42:04.733
We'll never understand them.

42:06.818 --> 42:09.530
I thought the neural net
could decode for us but,

42:10.781 --> 42:13.075
the pattern changes.

42:13.325 --> 42:14.785
Too complex.

42:16.870 --> 42:18.914
Too intelligent.

42:18.914 --> 42:21.542
Smarter than us.

42:22.709 --> 42:26.004
Smarter than me.

42:29.007 --> 42:30.342
So then…

42:30.342 --> 42:32.177
what are you doing?

42:33.846 --> 42:35.430
Transmitting.

42:35.889 --> 42:37.140
Transmitting??

42:37.766 --> 42:38.767
Files.

42:39.101 --> 42:40.853
What files?

42:40.853 --> 42:42.312
What files, Mitsuki?

42:46.525 --> 42:48.026
What are you doing?

42:57.035 --> 43:01.540
I had a dream we were in a band.

43:02.791 --> 43:05.085
But we didn't play music.

43:05.752 --> 43:08.213
There was a microphone, but

43:08.338 --> 43:09.464
What is this?

43:10.257 --> 43:11.758
My daughter.

43:13.719 --> 43:16.680
We were the most famous band in the world.

43:21.018 --> 43:22.519
There is the sun.

43:24.438 --> 43:26.481
I feel so good.

43:27.482 --> 43:28.901
Wake up!

43:29.985 --> 43:31.653
Mitsuki!

43:33.280 --> 43:34.323
See, kids are playing.

43:38.535 --> 43:40.120
It's thousands of these.

43:40.120 --> 43:40.787
Videos.

43:40.787 --> 43:42.664
Pictures.

43:43.457 --> 43:44.791
All of her.

43:45.709 --> 43:47.169
What have you done??

43:47.794 --> 43:50.923
Converted.

43:50.923 --> 43:54.384
To their format.

43:55.260 --> 43:57.221
Let them…

43:57.721 --> 43:59.181
see us.

43:59.556 --> 44:00.766
What??

44:01.517 --> 44:04.770
Sending on all frequencies…

44:06.396 --> 44:08.815
on the dish I commandeered.

44:11.527 --> 44:15.614
Oh, look at those flowers
with beautiful colors!

44:21.620 --> 44:24.081
It's okay. Mitsuki.

44:25.040 --> 44:27.042
It's okay.

44:29.169 --> 44:31.213
Stop the transmission.

44:36.176 --> 44:38.220
It's already been sent.

44:41.473 --> 44:43.559
Are we all going to die?

44:44.142 --> 44:46.270
Because she sent that?

44:46.728 --> 44:47.896
Because,

44:48.230 --> 44:50.899
no one down here could figure out
how to break through…

44:53.819 --> 44:54.778
…all this noise.

44:55.904 --> 44:56.822
But,

44:57.489 --> 44:59.783
we would have tried.

45:01.743 --> 45:03.579
It's morning.

45:04.538 --> 45:07.249
This is a park bench.

45:07.332 --> 45:09.501
Look! Everyone is walking.

45:10.586 --> 45:12.546
Kids are cute.

45:12.546 --> 45:14.715
And this is a tree. See?

45:15.299 --> 45:17.176
It's about to bloom, isn't it?

45:18.010 --> 45:20.095
And the grass.

45:22.514 --> 45:26.435
The sun is up in the sky.

45:27.060 --> 45:29.521
It's fun to walk, isn't it?

45:30.189 --> 45:32.357
Walk and talk.

45:33.192 --> 45:34.359
See?

45:34.359 --> 45:38.697
The sun is up high
in the sky and shining brightly.

45:38.697 --> 45:40.532
Look, look, this.

45:43.952 --> 45:46.663
Wake up already!

45:46.663 --> 45:49.666
I'll get pissed!

45:51.001 --> 45:52.669
I'll come to you!

45:54.254 --> 46:06.558
Wajo. Wajo. Wajo.

46:11.355 --> 46:27.871
Wajo.

46:29.831 --> 46:30.832
Hinata?
