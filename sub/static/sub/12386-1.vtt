01:18.000 --> 01:20.159
Good morning. Oh.

01:20.295 --> 01:23.165
- Thank you.
- No. Thank you.

01:23.298 --> 01:28.126
Hello. Hi.
I'm across the street.

01:28.262 --> 01:32.758
Who? No. No, no. There's nothing
wrong with the ad layouts.

01:32.850 --> 01:35.471
I checked them myself.

01:35.561 --> 01:38.348
No, no. Marjorie just must've
gotten the months wrong again.

01:38.481 --> 01:42.479
Yeah. Well, have you
talked to Laslo yet?

01:42.569 --> 01:44.479
I don't care if he's upset.

01:44.613 --> 01:47.484
Call Peter back and tell him
the layout has got to be four pages.

01:47.616 --> 01:50.190
Not seven, not six, not five. Four.

01:50.327 --> 01:52.201
- After...
- Hey, Robin.

01:52.330 --> 01:54.204
Well, that's because
we changed photographers.

01:54.332 --> 01:56.824
You must be kidding.
I... I double-checked everything.

01:56.919 --> 02:00.334
- What's wrong with the ad layouts?
- What's wrong with the ad layouts, Leo?

02:00.422 --> 02:03.293
I'll tell you what's wrong.
Practically everything.

02:03.383 --> 02:06.386
- Because they're the wrong ad layouts.
- Marjorie, I... I have no idea...

02:06.513 --> 02:10.178
Now, why am I standing here looking
at 30 pages of wrong layouts, Leo?

02:10.265 --> 02:13.054
I'll tell you why.
Because someone...

02:13.186 --> 02:15.892
Leo... didn't do their job!

02:17.149 --> 02:19.023
Okay, the copy on the cover reads:

02:19.152 --> 02:22.318
"Office Love Affairs...
How To Get Him And Your Raise."

02:22.404 --> 02:24.314
- Good.
- Yeah?

02:24.407 --> 02:28.452
Okay, look at me.
Come in a little closer.

02:28.579 --> 02:33.039
Okay, right here. Great.
Good, I think we got it.

02:33.167 --> 02:35.374
Carry on. Papaya diet?

02:35.461 --> 02:37.703
Big problem. They're talking
about changing the fruit.

02:37.838 --> 02:39.713
- What kind of fruit
are we talking about?
- I don't know.

02:39.841 --> 02:41.715
- They said kiwi or something.
- I don't like kiwi.

02:41.843 --> 02:44.417
These came for you.
They're from Frank.

02:44.554 --> 02:48.304
My goodness. He is so sweet.
He was in London.

02:48.434 --> 02:51.471
- Very exotic and expensive.
- Ohh.

02:51.604 --> 02:54.476
"Can't wait to see you.
It's felt like an eternity."

02:54.608 --> 02:56.565
- How long has he been gone?
- Two days.

02:56.652 --> 02:58.728
- Two days?
- Yes.

02:58.862 --> 03:01.354
"Meet me here at 7:30."
Ooh, good choice.

03:02.534 --> 03:04.692
"Bring doll."

03:04.786 --> 03:08.072
Doll. He does this kind
of thing all the time.

03:16.966 --> 03:20.964
Hula dolls.
Polynesian restaurant.

03:21.095 --> 03:22.969
Now just what are you up to?

03:23.098 --> 03:25.257
- It's all part of the surprise.
- Thank you.

03:25.392 --> 03:27.598
- Thanks. Uh-huh.
- Surprise?

03:28.312 --> 03:30.850
Surp... You're not breaking up
with me, are you?

03:30.981 --> 03:33.519
- No.
- Okay. You sure?

03:33.651 --> 03:36.855
Because 69% of all relationships
break up in restaurants.

03:36.989 --> 03:38.863
- We're not breaking up.
- Okay.

03:38.991 --> 03:42.110
In fact, I want to increase
the romance in our lives.

03:42.244 --> 03:46.112
- Oh, you do?
- Uh-huh. First, close your eyes.

03:46.249 --> 03:48.123
- Now?
- Close 'em.

03:48.251 --> 03:50.125
- Okay.
- All right.

03:50.254 --> 03:52.247
Now, remember all the times
that you said we never go anywhere...

03:52.339 --> 03:54.248
- And we're always working...
- Uh-huh. Right.

03:54.341 --> 03:56.250
- And we never have any fun?
- Well, yeah.

03:56.343 --> 03:59.879
Well, open your eyes
and look where I'm taking you.

04:00.014 --> 04:02.137
- Oh.
- Come on.

04:05.854 --> 04:09.638
- Oh, you're kidding!
- You and me in two weeks.

04:09.733 --> 04:12.438
- In two weeks? I can't.
- Oh, oh, you can.

04:12.528 --> 04:14.437
- I can?
- Uh-huh. I cleared it with Marjorie.

04:14.530 --> 04:16.855
You did? Oh, you're a sneak.

04:16.991 --> 04:20.824
Yeah. Six days and seven nights
on the secluded...

04:20.954 --> 04:24.323
tropical island paradise
of Makatea.

04:49.152 --> 04:51.026
Yeah. Yeah.
We arrived 15 minutes late.

04:51.154 --> 04:53.028
- Oh, is that a problem?
- No, no. That's fine.

04:53.156 --> 04:55.613
Uh, I'll tell you what.
Why don't I go find the bags...

04:55.743 --> 04:58.198
and you... you get to go find
the charter, okay?

04:58.287 --> 05:00.197
- I do? All right. Okay.
- Yeah. I'll see you in a few minutes.

05:00.289 --> 05:03.207
- Sweetie?
- Huh?

05:03.293 --> 05:05.499
- Love you.
- Love you.

05:30.865 --> 05:33.238
- Uh, excuse me.
- Aah! Son of a bitch!

05:33.326 --> 05:35.735
Miserable piece of rat shit.

05:38.498 --> 05:40.621
Could you help me?
I'm looking for Tropical Charters.

05:42.419 --> 05:45.291
- You goin' to Makatea?
- Yes.

05:46.591 --> 05:50.423
Well, we'll be ready
in ten... twenty minutes.

05:57.687 --> 06:01.636
But this...
this isn't the plane.

06:02.484 --> 06:04.607
- What?
- The plane.

06:04.695 --> 06:06.604
Where... Where's its mommy?

06:06.697 --> 06:10.742
Oh. Tropical's plane
is laid up in Fiji.

06:10.826 --> 06:15.073
We're filling in.
You're in luck. I'm your pilot.

06:15.164 --> 06:16.956
Oh.

06:17.041 --> 06:20.375
No. I ca... Uh, no. I, um...

06:20.504 --> 06:22.960
I can't go in this.
It's, uh... It's broken.

06:23.090 --> 06:25.842
No, it's not broken.
It's being maintained.

06:25.968 --> 06:28.044
- This is my plane.
- Uh-huh.

06:28.178 --> 06:30.053
This is a De Haviland Beaver.

06:30.181 --> 06:32.934
This is one of the safest,
most reliable planes ever built.

06:33.018 --> 06:36.303
Sweetie, is there a problem?

06:36.396 --> 06:41.640
Uh, yes. He, um... He seems to think
we're gonna go in this old thing.

06:41.736 --> 06:45.686
- What?
- Uh, I-I think... I think
we could find another charter.

06:45.824 --> 06:47.982
- Don't you?
- Won't find one.

06:48.117 --> 06:52.994
There's a boat leaves from the port.
Takes three days.

06:53.081 --> 06:55.158
- Honey. Frank, honey, honey.
- All right. All right.

06:55.251 --> 06:58.371
Uh, sweetie, I'm sure
the plane is perfectly safe...

06:58.504 --> 07:02.882
and I'm sure the pilot
is a trained professional.

07:03.009 --> 07:06.261
- He is the pilot.
- He...

07:06.389 --> 07:09.722
Well, if you're going,
it'll be 20, 30 minutes.

07:09.850 --> 07:12.009
I gotta get some oil.

07:12.145 --> 07:14.850
- Oil? He's gonna get some oil now.
- You're gonna need help
with this luggage.

07:14.939 --> 07:16.897
- No, thanks.
- No, we're good.

07:20.362 --> 07:22.354
All right.
Everybody tied down?

07:22.447 --> 07:24.487
Listen.
Are these really necessary?

07:24.575 --> 07:26.568
Only if we crash.

07:30.749 --> 07:33.868
- Hi.
- Everybody, this is Angelica,
our flight service director.

07:34.002 --> 07:36.042
Hello.

07:37.214 --> 07:39.337
Thank you. Hi.

07:39.425 --> 07:41.085
- Sorry. Excuse me. Oh!
- Ohh.

07:41.219 --> 07:43.793
Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

07:43.930 --> 07:46.053
- Oh!
- Hi, baby.

07:46.141 --> 07:48.549
Mmm, hello.
Are you guys going to Makatea?

07:48.685 --> 07:51.473
- We hope.
- Oh, you'll love it.
Are you from the States?

07:51.605 --> 07:54.358
- Yes.
- I lived there for a while too.
It's very fun.

07:54.442 --> 07:57.645
Hey, Quinn, look.
Look what I got. Check it out.

07:57.779 --> 08:00.733
- What's that, baby?
- It's a bathing suit, silly.

08:01.951 --> 08:04.026
I thought it was an eye patch.

08:53.007 --> 08:55.629
Welcome to Makatea.

08:55.719 --> 08:59.420
Here we are.
Thanks for flying Harris Freight...

08:59.515 --> 09:02.849
where frequent flyers earn bonus points
good for valuable merchandise.

09:02.977 --> 09:05.431
Hey, you're not trying
to steal my vest, are you?

09:13.279 --> 09:14.823
- Mr Martin, Miss Monroe?
- Yes.
- Yes.

09:14.949 --> 09:16.987
- Welcome to Hanaiti.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

09:17.075 --> 09:19.364
- I'm Phillippe St. Clair,
the general manager.
- Hi.

09:19.495 --> 09:21.653
Uh, can we have the reservation
for Mr Martin?

09:27.337 --> 09:31.086
Oh! Oh, this is beautiful.

09:31.216 --> 09:32.960
Wow.

09:34.053 --> 09:35.963
Wow.

09:38.975 --> 09:41.181
Okay. All right,
we're never leaving.

09:41.269 --> 09:43.179
Yes.

09:44.731 --> 09:48.979
I want this to be the most
unforgettable vacation of our lives.

09:55.910 --> 09:59.115
- Having a good time?
- Oh, honey, I'm having a great time.

10:01.250 --> 10:03.919
- Hey, you know what today is?
- What?

10:04.044 --> 10:07.461
- It's our anniversary.
- We have an anniversary?

10:07.590 --> 10:09.630
Yeah, unofficially.

10:09.759 --> 10:12.382
- Oh.
- Three years ago today, we first met.

10:14.014 --> 10:16.635
- Today? Today?
- Today. You don't remember?
We fought over a cab.

10:16.766 --> 10:19.638
- Oh, I called you a jerk. Yes. Yes.
- Yeah. Oh, great. That you remember.

10:19.771 --> 10:23.555
- Sorry.
- Yeah. See? But that's okay.
It was all part of love's odyssey.

10:24.609 --> 10:26.934
- Odyssey?
- Mm-hmm.

10:28.446 --> 10:31.234
If I asked, would you wear
something special for me tonight?

10:32.576 --> 10:35.329
- What did you have in mind?
- This.

10:40.961 --> 10:43.037
Will you marry me?

10:59.315 --> 11:03.644
The Calypsonians
were all gathered together

11:03.778 --> 11:07.064
Singing such a mournful tune

11:07.157 --> 11:11.320
I don't know
if it was in the summertime

11:11.453 --> 11:14.122
It could be the month of May or June

11:15.833 --> 11:19.618
- Believe me, baby, I know the best
- I'll be back in a sec, okay?

11:19.755 --> 11:23.586
- All right.
- When I find myself
I poke out my chest, oh

11:23.674 --> 11:27.424
Over loving
Over, over, over

11:27.512 --> 11:29.968
Over loving you

11:47.576 --> 11:50.282
I always thought
this was a beautiful island...

11:50.372 --> 11:54.321
but with you here,
it is even more beautiful.

11:54.417 --> 11:57.621
- Oh!
- How long have you been on Makatea?

11:58.922 --> 12:02.007
- Oh, you're kidding, right?
- No.

12:03.386 --> 12:05.510
Well, you brought me here.

12:05.597 --> 12:08.135
Today? Five hours ago?

12:08.225 --> 12:12.222
Oh, I'm so...
So much has happened since...

12:12.354 --> 12:14.513
Oh! Oops. Oopsy.

12:14.648 --> 12:17.353
Wow. Here you go. What's...

12:17.485 --> 12:19.359
- I slipped.
- Yeah.

12:19.487 --> 12:21.859
So, where's your, uh, copilot?

12:21.948 --> 12:24.903
Oh, she's busy with the tourists.

12:25.034 --> 12:27.193
Well, that sounds like
you don't like us.

12:27.329 --> 12:31.494
Oh, no. Never bite the hand
that-that feeds...

12:31.584 --> 12:33.909
uh, your mouth, whatever.

12:35.338 --> 12:39.253
Besides, you know, they're...
they're good for a laugh.

12:40.677 --> 12:42.967
- You're a big laugher, are you?
- Oh, yeah.

12:43.097 --> 12:45.173
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

12:45.266 --> 12:49.478
They come here
looking for the magic...

12:49.604 --> 12:52.724
expecting to find romance...

12:52.858 --> 12:55.064
when they can't find it
any other place.

12:57.196 --> 12:59.438
Maybe they will.

12:59.574 --> 13:01.946
It's an island, babe.

13:02.076 --> 13:06.241
If you don't bring it here,
you won't find it here.

13:07.623 --> 13:10.910
Oh, heavy. Pilot and philosopher.

13:13.297 --> 13:16.750
- Let me buy you a drink.
- Hey, I'm here with somebody.

13:16.884 --> 13:19.554
You remember him?
He came in with me.

13:21.514 --> 13:25.098
- I meant both of you.
- No, you didn't.

13:27.104 --> 13:29.014
You're from New York, aren't you?

13:29.148 --> 13:31.271
Hey, is everything okay?

13:31.359 --> 13:34.276
- Oh, hi. Nice to see you again.
- Yeah, you too.

13:34.403 --> 13:37.156
- Let me buy you a drink.
- Oh, that's very, uh...

13:37.282 --> 13:40.200
- Let's go.
- Oh, but we're leaving, and so...

13:40.327 --> 13:42.200
Well, maybe some other time...

13:42.329 --> 13:44.203
- Ta-ta.
- I'll buy you a drink.

13:44.331 --> 13:48.199
- Okay, bye.
- Was he bothering you?

13:48.336 --> 13:50.543
- Oh, no. He was just a little...
- Was he hitting on you?

13:50.673 --> 13:52.878
From over there,
it looked like he was hitting on you.

13:53.008 --> 13:54.882
- Maybe a little.
- He was?

13:55.010 --> 13:57.548
- Do you want me to do
something about it?
- Like what?

13:57.680 --> 14:00.432
Hey, I don't go to the gym every day
just to watch old guys shower.

14:00.517 --> 14:02.308
- You know, I will...
- Really?

14:02.394 --> 14:04.303
- Yeah.
- Really?

14:08.775 --> 14:10.899
Well done, ocean.

14:12.364 --> 14:14.321
Well done, sky.

14:14.448 --> 14:16.357
Well done, maitais.

14:18.161 --> 14:21.079
- Well done, silicone. Oh, my.
- Hey!

14:23.542 --> 14:26.330
Hey, I'm, I'm getting
a little toasty here.

14:26.420 --> 14:28.496
You want me to put
some cream on you, honey?

14:28.589 --> 14:32.172
You'd do that for me?
You... You'd cream me up?

14:32.302 --> 14:35.304
Only for you. Where is it?

14:35.389 --> 14:38.141
Excuse me. Miss Monroe?
You have a phone call.

14:38.225 --> 14:40.633
- I do?
- You could take it at the bar.

14:40.728 --> 14:43.054
What... Who would be
calling you here?

14:43.189 --> 14:45.859
I have no idea.
I'll be right back.

14:49.154 --> 14:51.193
- Can I get two maitais, please?
- Yes, ma'am.

14:51.322 --> 14:53.399
Thank you. Hello?

14:53.533 --> 14:55.408
Look, I know you're on vacation...

14:55.536 --> 14:57.825
but this is a dire emergency.

14:57.914 --> 14:59.954
- Oh, no.
- The photo shoot's on...

15:00.083 --> 15:02.206
but it's an availability nightmare.

15:02.335 --> 15:06.333
Vendela and Evander Holyfield
only have a mutual 17-hour window.

15:06.423 --> 15:08.499
If we don't get them now,
nobody's available...

15:08.592 --> 15:10.716
for four months and
we lose them for the May cover.

15:10.845 --> 15:13.550
Well, there's gotta be somebody closer
whose life you can screw up.

15:13.639 --> 15:16.130
That's the ironic thing, dear.
There's not.

15:16.267 --> 15:19.637
Vendela's in Sydney.
Evander's in Osaka.

15:19.771 --> 15:22.227
I threw Taylor on a plane
this morning to Papeete.

15:22.358 --> 15:25.477
- Tahiti?
- Yes. They're all coming to you.

15:25.610 --> 15:28.316
All you have to do
is fly back to Tahiti...

15:28.448 --> 15:30.275
baby-sit the shoot,
fly back out.

15:30.408 --> 15:33.908
- Fifteen hours at the most.
- Look, this is complicated.

15:33.996 --> 15:37.245
Uh, Frank proposed
to me last night.

15:37.332 --> 15:39.289
Oh, my God!

15:39.418 --> 15:42.040
This is so exciting.
Sweetie, I'm so happy for you.

15:42.130 --> 15:44.206
Well, I'm glad, but...

15:44.299 --> 15:46.542
The point is, what kind of message
am I sending to Frank...

15:46.635 --> 15:50.466
if the day after our betrothal, I'm
leaving him to go on some photo shoot?

15:53.851 --> 15:55.809
An excellent message.

15:55.937 --> 15:59.935
This is the perfect opportunity
to establish parameters.

16:00.024 --> 16:02.100
- Oh, God.
- I read somewhere...

16:02.235 --> 16:04.608
that 38.6% of all women...

16:04.696 --> 16:09.075
are pressured into quitting their jobs
in the first year of marriage.

16:09.160 --> 16:12.493
Marjorie, you read that
in our magazine, and we made it up.

16:12.622 --> 16:17.119
Oh, Please, Robin, please.
Please, please, Robin, please?

16:18.170 --> 16:20.626
- Deal.
- Oh, good!

16:20.715 --> 16:24.214
- Do you have a way back to Tahiti?
- Oh, yeah, I can...

16:28.014 --> 16:31.134
- That's good? Yeah?
- Mmm. Mm-hmm.

16:33.145 --> 16:35.018
Thanks.

16:43.198 --> 16:48.109
Don't move a muscle.
Lay down. Stay. Yeah.

16:49.872 --> 16:51.366
- Hi.
- Hello. Hi.

16:51.499 --> 16:54.500
- Uh, I'm looking for...
- Quinny, it's for you.

16:54.586 --> 16:57.456
Okay. Hi there.

16:57.547 --> 17:01.130
- Ohh.
- Hi. I'm really sorry to interrupt you.

17:01.218 --> 17:04.005
I-I sort of have an emergency.

17:04.096 --> 17:06.670
Emergency? What's going on?

17:06.766 --> 17:10.846
Well, my boss called me, and she
wants me to go to Tahiti tonight.

17:10.979 --> 17:14.893
Oh, well, I'm sort of
on my layover here.

17:15.023 --> 17:19.189
Right. Uh, would $500
cut your layover short?

17:19.280 --> 17:24.026
Um, baby, want to go to Papeete?

17:24.117 --> 17:27.203
I can't. I have a show tonight.
Tuesday is tamure night.

17:27.289 --> 17:29.661
- Uh, it's tamure night.
- Oh.

17:29.750 --> 17:32.869
My hands are tied.
That's for later.

17:34.254 --> 17:36.330
You know, I'm stuck.
I-I-I really...

17:36.423 --> 17:39.959
This is really important.
You'd be doing me a tremendous favour.

17:40.094 --> 17:44.840
- How would 700 be?
- Okay.

17:44.933 --> 17:45.928
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

17:46.059 --> 17:49.263
- Great.
- I'll meet you at the plane in...

17:49.397 --> 17:51.888
- Give me an hour.
- Great. Thank you.

17:51.983 --> 17:55.683
Honey, it's a known fact
that 38.6% of all women...

17:55.778 --> 17:59.230
are pressured into quitting their jobs
the first year of marriage.

17:59.324 --> 18:02.907
That was in your magazine.
You probably made it up.

18:07.666 --> 18:09.909
If you had to work,
I would understand.

18:11.212 --> 18:14.250
That's because you're not
as romantic as I am.

18:15.885 --> 18:19.717
Ohh. So, come with me.

18:21.808 --> 18:23.682
- No.
- How come?

18:23.810 --> 18:26.764
Because if I go with you,
I'll resent the fact that I'm there.

18:26.897 --> 18:31.025
If I stay here, I'll miss you, but
you'll feel guilty. I like that better.

18:31.151 --> 18:34.936
Come on.
It's only for one night, hubby.

18:36.992 --> 18:39.946
- Say that again.
- What, hubby?

18:41.121 --> 18:45.165
- I like that. Say it.
- Hubby.

18:52.592 --> 18:54.880
- Ready to go.
- Is it safe to fly?

18:55.011 --> 18:58.215
- It is with me.
- Oh, you're that good, huh?

18:58.349 --> 19:00.721
I'm the best you've ever been with.

19:00.851 --> 19:03.389
I'm not sure
I trust your equipment.

19:03.520 --> 19:06.272
We may be old, but we're sturdy.

19:06.356 --> 19:08.765
Mm-hmm. What's all this?

19:08.860 --> 19:12.479
Hotel overstocks, local trinkets.
I was gonna fly 'em to Tahiti tomorrow.

19:12.614 --> 19:15.152
But with your job,
I got a twofer.

19:15.284 --> 19:17.490
Oh, how handy for you.

19:19.163 --> 19:22.330
Excuse me. I just want to keep this
from flying at you.

19:22.459 --> 19:26.208
There we go.
Do you have my, uh, money?

19:26.338 --> 19:29.007
Oh. Yes.

19:29.091 --> 19:31.498
- Thank you.
- It's all there.

19:31.593 --> 19:33.503
I trust you.

20:10.304 --> 20:14.384
So what kind of work do you do,
uh, back there in New York?

20:14.474 --> 20:18.140
I'm an assistant editor
for a magazine called Dazzle.

20:18.271 --> 20:19.848
- Dazzle?
- Yeah.

20:19.939 --> 20:21.849
Never heard of that one.

20:21.942 --> 20:25.690
Well, you're not exactly
the demographic we shoot for.

20:25.779 --> 20:28.235
Uh, this is it.

20:30.117 --> 20:32.075
"Dazzle."

20:32.162 --> 20:36.325
"Your Derriere: Five Exercises
to Tame the Beast."

20:36.457 --> 20:39.079
"Ten Ways to Light His Fire."

20:41.046 --> 20:44.665
For Pete's sake.
"Ten Ways to Light His Fire."

20:46.636 --> 20:48.961
You know how a woman
gets a man excited?

20:49.096 --> 20:51.422
- How?
- She shows up.

20:51.558 --> 20:54.131
That's it. We're guys.
We're easy.

20:54.269 --> 20:57.888
Of course, for that you can't charge
six bucks an issue, can you?

20:59.191 --> 21:01.397
Now, does that advice
come with the $700...

21:01.485 --> 21:03.608
or do I need to pay extra for that?

21:03.738 --> 21:06.775
- It's on the house.
- Thanks.

22:31.043 --> 22:34.210
Um, island flight watch,
Beaver 0318.

22:34.297 --> 22:38.545
We are at 3,500
on a heading of, uh, 1-1-0.

22:38.636 --> 22:43.049
I'm looking for a weather update,
please, uh, along our route of flight.

22:43.181 --> 22:46.302
Thirty-six Victor, be advised...

22:49.397 --> 22:52.684
...southwestern...
- Say again.

23:01.244 --> 23:04.910
I'm sorry. This weather came up
quicker than anybody anticipated.

23:07.626 --> 23:10.081
We're gonna have to turn back
to Makatea.

23:11.213 --> 23:14.250
- It's just not worth the risk.
- Uh, all right.

23:30.735 --> 23:33.404
A line of squalls
has got us boxed in.

23:33.488 --> 23:36.194
Tighten up your seat belt.
It's gonna get bumpy.

23:36.325 --> 23:39.279
Wha... Uh.

23:39.370 --> 23:43.747
Y-You don't-don't mind
if I just come sit up here with you?

23:46.544 --> 23:48.454
Get your seat belt on.

23:59.059 --> 24:00.968
- What are those?
- Uh, Xanax.

24:01.103 --> 24:03.142
My doctor prescribed them
for situations of tension.

24:03.271 --> 24:05.348
- I think this qualifies.
- Give me a couple.

24:05.482 --> 24:07.356
You just drive.

24:38.894 --> 24:42.180
- What are you taking now?
- Xanax.

24:42.273 --> 24:45.061
My doctor prescribed them
for situations of "sension."

24:45.193 --> 24:47.067
Give me those.

24:53.911 --> 24:58.704
Whoo! Hey,
that was close, huh? Whoo!

25:01.836 --> 25:04.708
That was more than close.
That hit us.

25:04.798 --> 25:07.289
- Oh, no.
- Shit. It fried the radios.

25:07.426 --> 25:09.834
Oh, no. That's bad, huh?

25:14.184 --> 25:16.757
Mayday. Mayday. Mayday.

25:16.895 --> 25:20.893
Beaver 0318.
Unable to maintain altitude.

25:21.025 --> 25:23.148
Can anybody hear this?

25:24.528 --> 25:28.526
- Mayday. Mayday. Mayday.
- Attention, KMart shoppers!

25:28.616 --> 25:31.404
Snow shovels are on sale for $12.99.

25:31.537 --> 25:34.952
Put that down.
I'm unable to maintain altitude.

25:35.082 --> 25:38.083
Forty miles south-southeast of Makatea.

25:39.837 --> 25:42.922
Mayday, mayday, mayday

25:43.008 --> 25:46.092
How many of those things
did you take?

25:46.178 --> 25:50.472
Um, you know, I just don't know.

25:50.599 --> 25:51.880
- Look.
- What?

25:51.976 --> 25:54.764
We're in trouble here.
I want you to sit back...

25:54.855 --> 25:59.765
be quiet, keep your seat belt tight
and let me fly this thing.

26:01.444 --> 26:03.437
Yes, sir.

26:15.753 --> 26:17.995
There's an island down there.

26:20.008 --> 26:21.917
I can see a beach.

26:22.008 --> 26:24.927
- I'm gonna set us down.
- Okeydokey.

27:00.094 --> 27:02.881
- Rock on the beach!
There's a rock on the beach!
- Son of a bitch!

28:01.245 --> 28:03.119
Good morning.

28:04.957 --> 28:06.950
Could you get me a cup of coffee?

28:07.085 --> 28:10.585
Sure, I'll get right on it, ma'am.

28:10.714 --> 28:13.253
Oh, God, whe...

28:14.844 --> 28:17.131
- Where are we?
- Here.

28:17.262 --> 28:20.180
Where? Where?

28:20.308 --> 28:22.764
Somewhere between Makatea and Tahiti.

28:22.894 --> 28:26.264
That's... That's the best
I can do for you.

28:28.358 --> 28:31.312
Whoa! What happened?

28:31.445 --> 28:34.565
It crumpled the landing gear
when we hit.

28:34.657 --> 28:36.946
Well, aren't you gonna fix it?

28:37.035 --> 28:39.656
I mean, can't we...
can't we reattach it somehow?

28:39.788 --> 28:43.122
Oh, sure. We'll, like,
glue it back on.

28:43.208 --> 28:45.995
- How's that?
- Aren't you one of those guys?

28:47.213 --> 28:49.123
What guys?

28:49.216 --> 28:52.085
Those guy guys.
You know, those guys with skills.

28:52.176 --> 28:54.798
- Skills?
- Yeah.

28:54.888 --> 28:57.214
You send them out into the wilderness
with a pocketknife and a Q-tip...

28:57.350 --> 29:00.054
and they build you
a shopping mall.

29:00.186 --> 29:04.480
- You can't do that?
- No. No, I can't do that.

29:04.565 --> 29:08.184
But I can do this.
Does that help?

29:12.074 --> 29:14.113
I can get us out of here.

29:14.201 --> 29:16.574
- Oh, good.
- Yeah.

29:16.703 --> 29:20.074
Hey. Right? Huh?

29:20.208 --> 29:23.542
Phone, huh?
I'm gonna get us out of here.

29:25.214 --> 29:27.122
Pronto.

29:28.508 --> 29:31.843
Right. Come on, phone.

29:44.068 --> 29:46.357
So, what are we,
like, shipwrecked?

29:46.446 --> 29:49.362
- How do you want it?
- Excuse me?

29:49.490 --> 29:52.991
Do you want it sugar-coated
or right between the eyes?

29:53.912 --> 29:55.822
You pick.

29:59.043 --> 30:02.543
We've only got one wheel,
so we can't take off.

30:02.671 --> 30:07.049
Lightning fried the radio
and the emergency location transmitter.

30:07.177 --> 30:10.546
Air-Sea will probably try a rescue,
but without a beacon to hone in...

30:10.681 --> 30:13.765
it's like trying to find a flea
on an elephant's ass.

30:14.977 --> 30:18.346
The only thing we've got is...

30:18.439 --> 30:20.397
this flare gun and a single flare.

30:21.485 --> 30:23.561
Is it too late
to get it sugar-coated?

30:23.654 --> 30:25.776
That was sugar-coated.

30:29.369 --> 30:31.409
Well, then, what's the bad news?

30:34.333 --> 30:38.330
The bad news is
we may be here for a long time.

30:40.589 --> 30:46.094
You and me.
For a long, long...

30:47.471 --> 30:52.099
long, long, long, long time.

30:57.191 --> 31:00.275
Well, I want my $700 back.

31:02.363 --> 31:05.400
- What?
- You heard me. My $700. I want it back.

31:05.492 --> 31:08.778
You said you were gonna take me
to Tahiti. You didn't.

31:10.330 --> 31:13.248
Give it back. Come on.

31:18.882 --> 31:23.425
One, two, three...

31:26.223 --> 31:29.260
- Wha...
- I figure I got you halfway.

31:29.352 --> 31:32.388
Halfway? Halfway?

31:32.522 --> 31:34.396
- Halfway.
- Halfway? Whoo!

31:34.524 --> 31:37.478
Halfway? Oh, boy, you're good!

31:37.611 --> 31:41.479
Whoo! You got me halfway!
That's fantastic!

31:41.616 --> 31:44.651
Wha... What are you doing?
Hey! Hey! Get away from my plane!

31:44.785 --> 31:46.659
- Oh, you be quiet.
- Goddam it! Get outta there!

31:46.787 --> 31:48.780
- I'm gonna do something!
- Hey! Leave that stuff alone!

31:48.873 --> 31:50.831
- You shut up!
- Come on out! Get outta there!

31:50.959 --> 31:54.495
What do you think you're doing?
Leave my stuff a... Hey, hey, come on!

31:54.588 --> 31:58.004
What's this?
It's a boat.

31:58.133 --> 32:01.219
- It's a life raft.
- We can use that to get off the island.

32:01.346 --> 32:03.339
Where are you gonna go?
You don't even know where you are.

32:03.432 --> 32:05.804
Last thing you wanna do
is go bouncing around the ocean...

32:05.893 --> 32:08.929
in an eight-foot blowup boat.

32:09.063 --> 32:11.814
- Don't tell me what I want!
- Give that... Give it!

32:11.899 --> 32:15.399
Hey, don't pull on that!
Leave it alone! Hey, hey!

32:15.528 --> 32:19.989
Oh! Oh! Get... Wait! Wait!
Get me out! No! Oh!

32:29.127 --> 32:31.035
Quinn!

32:33.131 --> 32:35.504
Quinn!

32:35.592 --> 32:38.380
Get me out of here!

32:38.512 --> 32:41.383
Get me... Get me out of here!

32:47.564 --> 32:51.064
Are you gonna stop acting
like a lunatic?

32:51.194 --> 32:54.811
- Fuck you!
- Pardon me? What'd you say?

33:02.581 --> 33:06.875
- That's what I thought you said.
- Quinn.

33:09.380 --> 33:11.254
Yeah.

33:12.509 --> 33:15.178
Mr Martin? There's
a telephone call for Miss Monroe.

33:15.303 --> 33:17.426
Oh. I'll take it.

33:17.514 --> 33:19.637
Hello? Hello?

33:19.766 --> 33:22.637
We... This is Frank Martin.
Who is...

33:22.770 --> 33:26.269
Oh, hi, Marjorie.
It's Frank.

33:26.357 --> 33:29.144
No, she... she left yesterday.

33:30.695 --> 33:32.605
What?

33:32.697 --> 33:34.856
Mary, it's Phillippe
at Makatea.

33:34.992 --> 33:37.614
Uh, Quinn flew a lady
back to you last night.

33:37.745 --> 33:41.280
Can you look if the De Haviland
is at the gate? No, I'll wait.

33:41.416 --> 33:44.120
I ran into Tony. He said
that Quinny didn't make Tahiti.

33:44.252 --> 33:46.162
Hold on, Angelica.
We don't know anything yet.

33:46.296 --> 33:48.289
Yes, Mary, right here.

33:52.970 --> 33:55.093
Get Air-Sea Rescue, Mary.
Call me back.

33:55.180 --> 33:57.090
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no.

34:00.229 --> 34:03.977
Come on. You wanna drink water,
you gotta haul water. Let's go.

34:11.408 --> 34:13.315
- What are you lookin' at?
- Nothing.

34:13.451 --> 34:15.076
- Something.
- Nothing.

34:15.203 --> 34:17.326
Oh, don't give me that.
You were ogling.

34:17.414 --> 34:18.824
- Ogling?
- Yeah.

34:18.916 --> 34:21.621
- Ogling? Let me ask you something.
- What?

34:21.710 --> 34:24.166
When you go into the store
to buy something like that,
what do you say to the clerk?

34:24.297 --> 34:26.704
"Give me that outfit
so nobody'll look at me"?

34:26.841 --> 34:30.341
No, I like people looking.
Just not you.

34:37.728 --> 34:39.637
If it makes you feel any better,
you're not my type.

34:39.730 --> 34:42.768
- Oh, good. Why?
- Why?

34:42.900 --> 34:46.068
Yeah. You know,
I'm making conversation. Why?

34:49.407 --> 34:52.907
You talk too much.
You're opinionated.

34:53.036 --> 34:57.367
You're stubborn,
sarcastic and stuck-up.

34:57.459 --> 35:00.625
Your ass is too narrow,
and your tits are too small.

35:04.216 --> 35:06.542
Hey, you wanna know why
you're not my type?

35:06.635 --> 35:08.545
Nope.

35:18.774 --> 35:20.317
- I'm American.
- Oh, thank God.

35:20.443 --> 35:22.482
- Tom Morrow. I'll take you up.
- Frank. Listen, so how do we find them?

35:22.611 --> 35:25.103
Well, we're gonna fly over the water
and look out the window.

35:25.239 --> 35:27.113
Wh... Whoa-Whoa-Whoa-Whoa.
That's it?

35:27.241 --> 35:29.318
What about the, uh,
the modern technology?

35:29.452 --> 35:31.327
Don't you have, like,
satellites, lasers...

35:31.455 --> 35:33.910
- Mr Martin, take a seat.
- Heat-seeking kind of...

35:33.999 --> 35:36.158
- Hey, I'm Ricky.
- Good. Great. I'm Frank.

35:36.294 --> 35:39.248
- Listen, money is no object, all right?
- Yeah. Just get in.

35:41.257 --> 35:44.461
Try breathing very deeply.
I find that helpful.

35:47.139 --> 35:49.215
If they went into the water,
it's only been 12 hours.

35:49.308 --> 35:52.095
- There's a good chance we'll find them.
- Okay.

36:12.167 --> 36:15.951
Hey, Bwana, why don't you
let me lead for a while?

36:17.506 --> 36:20.543
Okay. This'll be interesting.

36:33.607 --> 36:38.484
Now there. You see?
I found it.

36:45.787 --> 36:47.910
Come on, Quinny.

36:54.172 --> 36:56.497
Oh, my God.

37:01.430 --> 37:03.339
Oh, it's beautiful.

37:05.351 --> 37:08.685
Quinn, this is...
Whoa! Whoa!

37:08.772 --> 37:12.521
Wha... Who... Wait! Oh, God!

37:12.651 --> 37:15.273
- Hey! Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey, hold on!
- Whoa!

37:15.404 --> 37:18.191
- What are you doin'?
- What the hell's that?

37:18.282 --> 37:20.440
It's a pig.
What are you worried about?

37:20.576 --> 37:23.364
He's more afraid of us than we...
Watch! Watch!

37:23.455 --> 37:25.697
Hah! Go on! Go on!

37:25.791 --> 37:28.745
- Go on! Get outta here! Go on!
- Hyah! Hyah!

37:28.878 --> 37:31.913
- Ohh!
- Bye-bye! Come on!

37:33.424 --> 37:36.046
- Come on!
- Hey, Quinn?

37:36.135 --> 37:38.294
Huh? What?

37:38.430 --> 37:40.636
What?

37:40.765 --> 37:45.891
I'm sorry to interrupt you, but, uh,
I'm having a bit of a problem.

37:48.608 --> 37:50.601
What's the problem?

37:50.736 --> 37:54.898
Some sort of creature
has just swum up my pants.

37:57.868 --> 38:00.574
I'm guessing... I'm guessing a snake.

38:02.082 --> 38:06.542
Oh. That's bad.

38:07.879 --> 38:11.130
So, uh, what do I do?

38:11.258 --> 38:14.592
I mean, I could reach down
and, and grab it.

38:14.679 --> 38:19.258
No, that... that could be risky.
It might be poisonous.

38:20.518 --> 38:23.604
Well, right. But on the other hand,
if it's poisonous and will bite me...

38:23.730 --> 38:27.431
do I want to allow it to continue
to swim around in my shorts?

38:27.567 --> 38:30.604
- All good questions.
- Would you just give me some advice?

38:30.696 --> 38:33.318
All right? Just advice, input, anything.
Just give it to me.

38:33.449 --> 38:36.736
I'm very open at this particular
juncture, all right?

38:36.829 --> 38:38.737
- Just stand still.
- Still.

38:38.830 --> 38:41.368
- Stand still.
- Right. Yeah.

38:41.500 --> 38:43.457
- What are you doing?
- Relax.

38:43.544 --> 38:45.453
All right.

38:49.634 --> 38:51.508
Oh, God.

38:52.346 --> 38:54.054
- No.
- What?

38:54.181 --> 38:56.968
- Not good.
- What? Wha...

38:57.059 --> 39:00.226
Shhh. I'm trying to concentrate here.

39:00.354 --> 39:02.726
Okay. Okay.

39:02.857 --> 39:05.183
All right, let's see.

39:17.248 --> 39:20.333
Better not catch you smiling.

39:24.214 --> 39:26.670
Oh, God. Oh, God!

39:36.102 --> 39:40.515
- Thanks.
- Well, I'm not without skills.

40:27.994 --> 40:30.781
Oh. You're going on a date?

40:32.082 --> 40:34.999
- Do you like it?
- Why the fashion statement?

40:35.126 --> 40:37.914
- Goin' hunting.
- Oh. For what?

40:41.718 --> 40:45.169
No! You wouldn't!

40:45.304 --> 40:47.428
They are magnificent creatures!

40:47.516 --> 40:50.267
And I hear they taste
just like chicken.

40:50.393 --> 40:52.268
Chicken.

41:14.921 --> 41:17.128
Maybe I should have a taste.

41:17.257 --> 41:19.629
You know, just in case somebody asks me
someday, "Have you ever had peacock"...

41:19.759 --> 41:22.547
I can say, "Yes, I have."

41:23.723 --> 41:26.178
You won't regret it.

41:26.308 --> 41:29.145
Okay. Perfect.

41:30.355 --> 41:33.973
Whoa! Ah.

41:41.243 --> 41:45.026
Oh. Oh, my God!

41:45.163 --> 41:48.912
Mmm. Mmm. Wow.

41:51.879 --> 41:54.002
Chicken. Okay, chicken.

41:57.802 --> 42:01.670
- Have you always been a pilot?
- All my grown-up life.

42:01.765 --> 42:04.600
- Like doing what?
- All kinds of flying.

42:04.726 --> 42:07.847
- Mm-hmm.
- I had my own very successful business.

42:09.064 --> 42:10.938
What happened?

42:13.904 --> 42:17.023
I found a better way of life,
that's all.

42:18.116 --> 42:21.034
- Like what?
- Came out here...

42:21.161 --> 42:24.163
got a nice little house
on a beautiful beach.

42:24.248 --> 42:26.740
- Mm-hmm.
- Got my plane.

42:28.086 --> 42:29.995
Uh-oh. Hmm.

42:31.297 --> 42:35.877
I'm doing what I wanna do.
Got peace and quiet.

42:36.011 --> 42:38.764
Living the life
every man dreams of.

42:38.890 --> 42:41.463
Well, yeah, until they're 12.

42:45.772 --> 42:48.442
I'm sorry.
That was out of line.

42:48.567 --> 42:51.687
- No.
- I'm just...

42:51.779 --> 42:54.780
I'm just cranky, you know,
from being shipwrecked.

43:14.804 --> 43:18.090
Look at that sky. You don't see
a sky like that in New York City.

43:18.183 --> 43:20.223
No, that's a good sky.

43:21.979 --> 43:25.017
- Whoa.
- All right. Sorry. I'm...

43:26.526 --> 43:29.361
I'm just a little tipsy.
That's...

43:34.202 --> 43:36.111
Good night.

43:40.208 --> 43:42.663
Good night.

43:49.593 --> 43:52.000
Suave.

43:52.137 --> 43:54.011
Really suave.

44:18.083 --> 44:20.242
Oh.

44:23.173 --> 44:25.663
Oh, my God. It's a plane. Oh!

44:26.926 --> 44:30.178
Oh, it's a plane. What do we, uh...

44:30.264 --> 44:33.799
Flare! We need the flare!
Uh, Quinn?

44:33.893 --> 44:39.517
Quinn, uh, get up!
There's a plane! We need...

44:39.649 --> 44:42.603
Oh, God! Quinn, we need...

44:44.196 --> 44:48.359
Okay. Oh. Oh!

44:48.450 --> 44:50.360
Careful.

44:52.246 --> 44:54.785
Flare! Jesus!

45:01.089 --> 45:04.007
- Hey, baby.
- Oh, no.

45:07.597 --> 45:11.642
Uh-oh. Oh, boy.

45:11.768 --> 45:15.469
Oh! Oh, no.

45:17.066 --> 45:19.902
Oh, uh-oh. Oh, no.

45:20.028 --> 45:22.067
- Wha...
- Oh, nuts.

45:29.955 --> 45:33.407
What... Oh!

45:33.501 --> 45:36.537
What the hell did you do?
What the... You...

45:36.629 --> 45:41.257
You wasted our only goddam flare
to shoot a goddam palm tree?

45:41.343 --> 45:44.095
I wouldn't have shot the goddam tree
if you hadn't rolled into me.

45:44.180 --> 45:47.465
I was trying to signal
the goddam plane!

45:47.599 --> 45:49.758
Wha... What goddam plane?

45:49.852 --> 45:52.605
That goddam plane.

45:55.859 --> 45:57.935
- That goddam plane?
- Yeah.

45:58.070 --> 45:59.897
That's a commercial airliner.

45:59.989 --> 46:02.824
It's five miles high,
going 600 miles an hour!

46:02.950 --> 46:07.446
They wouldn't see a nuclear explosion
if they were looking for it
much less a flare!

46:07.538 --> 46:09.448
How the hell was I
supposed to know that?

46:09.541 --> 46:12.292
If you hadn't drunken yourself into
a coma, maybe you could've told me that!

46:12.377 --> 46:14.037
- Do you know what you've done?
- What?

46:14.171 --> 46:15.547
- Do you know what you've done?
- What?

46:15.673 --> 46:19.124
You've taken our one good chance
of being found and pissed it away!

46:19.260 --> 46:21.502
Don't you dare blame this on me!
If you were half a pilot...

46:21.637 --> 46:23.796
we wouldn't be on this island!

46:23.890 --> 46:25.847
I am the best goddam pilot
you're ever gonna meet!

46:25.976 --> 46:30.057
Huh! I've flown with you twice.
You've crashed half the time!

46:31.606 --> 46:35.557
And there is nothing
wrong with my tits!

46:51.004 --> 46:55.880
- There's so much water.
- Don't worry.

46:56.009 --> 47:01.431
Wherever they are, Quinny is going
to take good care of your girlfriend.

47:01.558 --> 47:03.432
What do you mean by that?

47:06.312 --> 47:08.638
Come on, let's pick up
the pace a little.

47:08.732 --> 47:11.224
I want to get to the top
before dark.

47:36.305 --> 47:38.214
Goddam.

47:39.390 --> 47:43.389
I've had just about as much
vacation as I can stand.

47:55.284 --> 47:57.905
Whoo! Whoo! God!

47:58.037 --> 48:00.077
- Stop. Stop. Stop.
- What stop? What? Stop.

48:00.164 --> 48:01.575
- Stop!
- What?

48:01.666 --> 48:03.574
- Stop.
- What?

48:07.089 --> 48:09.758
What?

48:19.477 --> 48:22.016
We better find the beacon.

48:26.318 --> 48:28.228
This way.

48:34.160 --> 48:36.947
That beacon better be up there.

48:37.080 --> 48:40.283
Look, the storm blew us
southwest 40 minutes.

48:40.375 --> 48:42.784
Good chance this is Tamitange.

48:42.920 --> 48:45.412
Ah, Tamitange. Well,
that explains everything.

48:45.507 --> 48:48.840
There's a radio navigation beacon
on the top of Tamitange.

48:48.968 --> 48:52.587
We find it. We shut it down.
They come out and fix it. We're rescued.

48:54.183 --> 48:58.098
It took 'em two years to fix
the streetlight outside my apartment.

49:01.106 --> 49:02.980
Wow.

49:22.089 --> 49:23.997
Oh, wow.

49:25.426 --> 49:27.502
Wow, this is beautiful. Well?

49:36.772 --> 49:39.098
So, where's the beacon?

49:42.570 --> 49:44.528
Huh?

49:44.656 --> 49:47.906
- Well...
- Oh, let me see.

49:48.034 --> 49:52.862
Well, it's this one, right?
Tamitange, the one with the funny-shaped
peninsula to the north, right?

49:52.956 --> 49:56.705
- Yeah.
- Well, tha... that's north, right?

49:58.129 --> 50:00.702
- Right? Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

50:04.803 --> 50:07.211
There's no peninsula.

50:07.348 --> 50:10.017
Who stole the peninsula?

50:11.561 --> 50:16.556
- No.
- This isn't Tamitange?

50:22.447 --> 50:25.022
So there is no beacon
that we're gonna turn off...

50:25.118 --> 50:28.072
and they're gonna come fix it
and find us?

50:31.000 --> 50:33.953
Well, well, we could be, um...

50:37.047 --> 50:41.924
We could be further to the south.
This could be Mata Nui.

50:45.306 --> 50:48.556
And what's on Mata Nui?

50:52.690 --> 50:55.098
Us.

50:59.030 --> 51:02.280
What? What do I want...

51:02.367 --> 51:04.277
What are you doing?

51:10.376 --> 51:12.998
Son of a bitch! Goddam it!

51:32.775 --> 51:35.184
Uh, please don't do that again.

51:35.320 --> 51:39.568
I just want one goddam thing
to go right.

51:39.701 --> 51:42.986
Oh, God. I know. Come on.

51:43.121 --> 51:47.534
Ever since we've been here,
you've been so confident.

51:47.668 --> 51:51.334
- You have all the answers.
- Well, I'm the captain.

51:51.422 --> 51:55.669
That's my job. It's no good for me
to go waving my arms in the air...

51:55.759 --> 51:58.678
and screaming,
"Oh, shit, we're gonna die."

51:59.889 --> 52:02.013
That doesn't evoke
much confidence, does it?

52:02.101 --> 52:04.472
No, no, that does not.

52:05.854 --> 52:08.642
I need you to be
my confident captain.

52:10.985 --> 52:15.197
I can't tell you how difficult
this is gonna be for me if you lose it.

52:20.746 --> 52:22.620
Okay.

52:26.170 --> 52:28.043
Okay.

52:29.714 --> 52:32.336
- I'm all right now.
- Oh, good. Good.

52:39.684 --> 52:41.723
Wait. Quinn.

52:41.852 --> 52:44.344
What? What?

52:44.481 --> 52:46.308
What do you need?
Hey. Come on. Get out of there.

52:46.400 --> 52:49.436
- What do you want?
- Look, look, look, look.

52:49.570 --> 52:51.479
Oh, yes.

52:51.571 --> 52:54.692
It's a boat.

52:58.288 --> 52:59.913
Looks like they're puttin' in
to that cove.

53:00.040 --> 53:03.124
Yeah, well, how do we signal 'em?

53:03.251 --> 53:05.375
- A flare would be nice.
- Don't start. Come on.

53:05.462 --> 53:07.539
What do we do?
How do we get down there?

53:07.673 --> 53:09.465
Well, we go...

53:09.592 --> 53:11.467
- Down the mountain, up the mountain,
down the mountain.
- Yeah.

53:11.595 --> 53:13.339
- We get to our life raft...
- Uh-huh.

53:13.429 --> 53:16.218
and hope they'll still be
there in the morning. Come on.

54:03.486 --> 54:05.146
Oh, God.

54:19.546 --> 54:22.251
- Come on. I'll take over.
- Oh, God. Thanks.

54:27.262 --> 54:29.421
So what's the deal
with you and, um...

54:32.894 --> 54:34.851
- Angelica.
- Yeah.

54:36.981 --> 54:38.974
No deal. We're friends.

54:39.067 --> 54:41.737
She works at the hotel
a couple months a year.

54:41.862 --> 54:45.646
We have some laughs.
Keep it simple.

54:45.782 --> 54:48.404
Has it always been simple...

54:48.535 --> 54:50.992
or has there ever been
anyone complicated?

54:54.167 --> 54:56.160
That's a yes. Yes?

54:57.420 --> 55:00.422
How complicated?
Scale from one to ten?

55:00.549 --> 55:02.293
- Twelve.
- Twelve?

55:02.384 --> 55:04.461
God. What happened?

55:06.014 --> 55:10.058
Well, tragically,
she, uh, she...

55:10.184 --> 55:12.641
Died? Oh, my God.
I'm so, I'm so...

55:12.730 --> 55:14.853
- No, she didn't die!
- Oh. Oh.

55:14.982 --> 55:17.271
- You gonna let me tell the story,
or what?
- I'm sorry!

55:17.401 --> 55:19.311
Sure. Tell it.

55:19.404 --> 55:23.448
She, uh, fell in love
with somebody else.

55:23.575 --> 55:26.860
Not just somebody else.

55:26.953 --> 55:30.703
My best friend. My partner.
The guy I was in business with.

55:30.833 --> 55:33.121
God. What did you do?

55:33.252 --> 55:36.337
Well, I, uh, bowed out.
I gave 'em my blessing.

55:38.424 --> 55:40.583
Are they still together?

55:40.719 --> 55:44.134
No. They broke up.

55:45.432 --> 55:48.303
- Not before I sold 'em
my half of the business.
- Uh-huh.

55:48.436 --> 55:51.557
Came out here. Got my plane.

55:51.690 --> 55:54.395
Never looked back.
Best thing that ever happened to me.

55:56.027 --> 55:58.733
- There are two boats.
- What? Two boats?

55:58.864 --> 56:00.738
Two boats!

56:02.911 --> 56:04.239
Look.

56:04.329 --> 56:07.828
God, this is great, huh?
Hello!

56:13.297 --> 56:15.171
Hello!

56:19.387 --> 56:21.594
- Sit down! We gotta get out of here!
- Why? Why?

56:21.681 --> 56:23.721
- We gotta get out of here!
- What? Get out of here?

56:23.809 --> 56:26.514
- Shit! Shit, shit, shit.
- What are you talking about?

56:26.645 --> 56:29.101
Oh, my God!

56:32.401 --> 56:35.522
- Who... Who are they?
- Pirates!

56:35.656 --> 56:37.944
Pi... Pirates? As in, "argh"?

56:38.074 --> 56:40.447
Smugglers. Thieves.

56:40.536 --> 56:43.157
They rob boats!

56:43.289 --> 56:46.741
- Rob boats? They just killed a guy!
- They'll kill us too.

56:46.835 --> 56:50.334
- Just for bein' here!
Just for seein' 'em!
- Wha...

57:13.114 --> 57:15.984
- Shit, he just saw me.
- We got company.

57:22.207 --> 57:23.950
Ohh. Oh, no.

57:24.919 --> 57:27.374
They just lowered a boat!

57:27.505 --> 57:30.506
- What kind of a boat?
- A motorboat!

57:30.591 --> 57:32.501
Shit! Shit!

57:32.635 --> 57:34.178
Shit!

57:44.023 --> 57:45.850
Oh, God! Row faster!

58:00.250 --> 58:01.364
Go! Go, go.

58:50.722 --> 58:53.261
I can't.

58:53.392 --> 58:54.970
Yes, you can.

58:55.102 --> 58:57.179
How'd he get over there?

59:07.574 --> 59:09.448
- Go.
- Where? What?

59:51.915 --> 59:53.825
Don't!

59:56.379 --> 59:59.131
Let's not make this difficult.

01:00:02.887 --> 01:00:07.430
That was a very stupid thing to do.
Now I'm gonna have to kill you.

01:00:08.559 --> 01:00:10.635
- Say goodbye.
- We've got gold.

01:00:18.196 --> 01:00:20.104
Up.

01:00:21.949 --> 01:00:23.527
Gold?

01:00:24.618 --> 01:00:26.991
- Gold.
- Yeah, we've got gold.

01:00:28.832 --> 01:00:31.370
I'm a jewellry designer.

01:00:31.501 --> 01:00:34.705
I design jewellry with gold.
And precious stones.

01:00:34.796 --> 01:00:39.626
- Precious stones, like, uh...
- I have sold to all the finest stores.

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:43.544
And, um, we've got display cases
on the... on the boat.

01:00:43.681 --> 01:00:46.220
Because, uh, we're expanding
the business in the Far East.

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:49.062
But that's my husband's end
of the business.

01:00:49.147 --> 01:00:52.516
- 'Cause I'm-I'm in marketing.
- Wiz! You're a wiz!

01:01:08.251 --> 01:01:10.658
Take us to the boat.

01:01:34.906 --> 01:01:36.697
Hey!

01:02:12.531 --> 01:02:13.906
Oh, my God! Now what?

01:02:15.576 --> 01:02:18.446
We go on three.
One, two...

01:02:18.537 --> 01:02:21.823
I can't!
You go. Save yourself.

01:02:25.796 --> 01:02:27.835
- I'm sorry.
- For kissing me?

01:02:27.964 --> 01:02:30.670
No. For this.

01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:55.535
Damn!

01:02:55.621 --> 01:02:57.031
Damn!

01:03:04.338 --> 01:03:06.296
You know how some people say...

01:03:06.424 --> 01:03:09.378
"You don't know what you had
until you lose it"?

01:03:10.930 --> 01:03:12.637
It's a load of crap.

01:03:12.764 --> 01:03:14.674
I knew what I had.

01:03:17.770 --> 01:03:20.178
God, I loved her.

01:03:20.273 --> 01:03:22.350
Love her. Love her.

01:03:23.943 --> 01:03:25.817
Not to insult you, but...

01:03:25.946 --> 01:03:28.235
I don't think men know
what love is.

01:03:28.324 --> 01:03:29.901
- I mean...
- I do.

01:03:30.034 --> 01:03:31.148
- Yeah?
- I do!

01:03:31.285 --> 01:03:33.824
Well, guys, they tell me
they love me all the time.

01:03:33.955 --> 01:03:36.410
Well, I'm sure at least
some of them mean it.

01:03:36.498 --> 01:03:38.408
No, they don't.

01:04:43.116 --> 01:04:44.657
Do you think they gave up?

01:04:44.742 --> 01:04:48.158
I don't know.
We shouldn't go back to the camp.

01:04:48.246 --> 01:04:50.572
The plane's too easy to spot.

01:04:50.707 --> 01:04:52.997
I am so scared.

01:04:53.084 --> 01:04:56.668
If it makes you feel any better,
I'm a little scared myself.

01:04:56.797 --> 01:05:00.001
No. No, that does not
make me feel better.

01:05:00.092 --> 01:05:02.549
- I thought that's what women wanted.
- What?

01:05:02.678 --> 01:05:05.134
Men who weren't afraid to cry...

01:05:05.223 --> 01:05:07.181
who are in touch
with their feminine side.

01:05:07.267 --> 01:05:10.386
No, not when they're being chased by
pirates. They like 'em mean and armed.

01:05:31.501 --> 01:05:32.997
Whoa.

01:05:35.798 --> 01:05:38.836
This is not a good island
for aeroplanes.

01:05:38.928 --> 01:05:41.763
It's a Japanese World War II
float plane.

01:05:41.889 --> 01:05:44.297
It's been up there
for 50 years.

01:05:45.977 --> 01:05:47.685
Jesus.

01:05:47.770 --> 01:05:50.393
You don't think there's
any way that you could...

01:05:50.482 --> 01:05:52.854
Nah.

01:05:52.943 --> 01:05:55.695
This looks like a safe place
to spend the night.

01:05:58.323 --> 01:06:01.741
I'm gonna see if there's
anything I can use up there.

01:06:09.754 --> 01:06:11.876
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:06:13.007 --> 01:06:14.917
This is me here.

01:06:19.055 --> 01:06:21.427
We gotta meet them
at 6:00 a.m.

01:06:21.558 --> 01:06:23.634
They're gonna widen the search.

01:06:23.769 --> 01:06:26.557
I may be too drunk
to wake up at 6:00 a.m.

01:06:26.648 --> 01:06:28.640
I know how... how...

01:06:32.153 --> 01:06:35.439
Are you sure you're okay?
You're-You're fine?

01:06:35.532 --> 01:06:37.774
Yeah, I'm...

01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:40.401
I'm just going
to take a shower...

01:06:40.496 --> 01:06:42.370
and get into bed.

01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:47.955
- Are you okay?
- I'm good. Yeah.

01:06:48.088 --> 01:06:51.124
I mean, do you want
to stay here tonight?

01:06:52.091 --> 01:06:55.876
- Stay?
- Yeah, with me.

01:06:56.013 --> 01:06:59.015
I mean, you probably think
I'm being slutty or something, but...

01:06:59.142 --> 01:07:01.811
I'm feeling bad,
and you're feeling bad.

01:07:01.895 --> 01:07:04.302
And I'd really like
for you to stay.

01:07:04.439 --> 01:07:06.147
I-I just don't th...

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:09.393
Yeah. Sure, why not?

01:07:09.528 --> 01:07:12.067
- Yeah?
- No, no, I can't.

01:07:12.198 --> 01:07:15.649
I mean, I'm, I'm still clinging
to-to hope.

01:07:15.743 --> 01:07:19.077
And if-if I...
I mean, if-if we, you know...

01:07:20.541 --> 01:07:22.083
Holy...

01:07:23.544 --> 01:07:26.580
- No!
- No?

01:07:27.381 --> 01:07:28.959
N-No, I...

01:07:30.218 --> 01:07:32.590
Are you sure?

01:07:34.473 --> 01:07:37.011
Oh, yeah.

01:07:37.101 --> 01:07:40.600
Yeah, no, I seem
to be leaving the room.

01:07:50.407 --> 01:07:52.067
Breadfruit.

01:07:53.994 --> 01:07:56.402
- It's not bread.
- It's not fruit.

01:08:10.388 --> 01:08:12.297
I want to kiss you.

01:08:17.062 --> 01:08:19.304
I really liked kissing you.

01:08:19.439 --> 01:08:21.314
I liked kissing you.

01:08:26.948 --> 01:08:28.358
But?

01:08:30.911 --> 01:08:33.533
But if I start,
I'm not gonna be able to stop.

01:08:38.042 --> 01:08:40.368
- Sounds good.
- Doesn't it?

01:08:40.462 --> 01:08:43.169
I-I... Oh.

01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:44.794
I can't.

01:09:04.031 --> 01:09:06.357
We should get some sleep.

01:09:14.667 --> 01:09:16.328
Come here.

01:09:26.639 --> 01:09:28.549
This feels good.

01:09:30.644 --> 01:09:33.596
And safe.
Feels good and safe.

01:10:15.027 --> 01:10:16.687
Good morning.

01:10:16.821 --> 01:10:20.320
Wh... What-What are you doin'?

01:10:20.407 --> 01:10:22.982
- I got a plan.
- Good.

01:10:23.078 --> 01:10:26.862
Anything I can do to help?

01:10:26.957 --> 01:10:28.535
Yeah.

01:10:29.501 --> 01:10:32.039
Yeah, just a second.

01:10:39.095 --> 01:10:40.589
What is it?
What's wrong?

01:10:40.722 --> 01:10:43.676
Angelica, the helicopter's
going up in 20 minutes.

01:10:43.767 --> 01:10:45.890
If you're going, vite, huh?

01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:47.811
Oh, Geez, I didn't realize
it was...

01:10:47.939 --> 01:10:50.643
Okay. Thank you, Phillippe.
Tell them I am on my way, okay?

01:10:56.364 --> 01:10:58.487
The helicopter's going up
in 20 minutes.

01:10:58.617 --> 01:11:01.701
Oh, God. What did...
What did I do?

01:11:01.787 --> 01:11:03.910
And how many times
did I do it?

01:11:03.998 --> 01:11:08.375
- Are you okay?
- Huh? No, no. This was wrong.
This was all wrong.

01:11:08.461 --> 01:11:11.213
Excuse me?
How could you say that?

01:11:11.297 --> 01:11:14.584
No, I mean, everything you did
was very right.

01:11:14.677 --> 01:11:17.547
But what I did was wrong!
This was wrong!

01:11:19.264 --> 01:11:23.595
No, no. It's just we are
going through a terrible ordeal.

01:11:23.687 --> 01:11:26.439
It's like when after a funeral...

01:11:26.565 --> 01:11:29.269
- Yeah?
- Everybody has sex.

01:11:30.652 --> 01:11:32.775
Not everybody.

01:11:32.905 --> 01:11:34.613
- No?
- No!

01:11:34.699 --> 01:11:35.779
Oh.

01:12:04.649 --> 01:12:05.977
What?

01:12:10.072 --> 01:12:11.780
Nothin'.

01:12:14.410 --> 01:12:16.781
You know that woman
I was tellin' you about?

01:12:18.372 --> 01:12:22.039
- The heartbreaker?
- She was my wife.

01:12:22.169 --> 01:12:25.502
- Oh.
- Twelve years.

01:12:27.883 --> 01:12:29.591
You have any kids?

01:12:31.137 --> 01:12:33.841
No, we didn't have
any kids, thank God.

01:12:33.973 --> 01:12:36.594
But I always wanted kids.

01:12:36.726 --> 01:12:39.810
- A bunch of them.
- Really?

01:12:40.981 --> 01:12:42.689
There's still time.

01:12:46.404 --> 01:12:48.195
What? Come on.

01:12:48.322 --> 01:12:50.611
How old are you?

01:12:50.742 --> 01:12:52.699
Well, what do...

01:12:52.828 --> 01:12:54.785
How old do you think I am?

01:12:56.873 --> 01:12:59.365
- Hmm. Let me think.
- Guess.

01:13:00.044 --> 01:13:01.454
Forty-five.

01:13:04.673 --> 01:13:06.548
Forty-eight?

01:13:08.095 --> 01:13:09.839
Fifty. You fifty?

01:13:15.186 --> 01:13:17.095
You still look good.

01:13:17.230 --> 01:13:19.437
I still am good.

01:13:28.409 --> 01:13:31.245
Let's get these apart.
We gotta take 'em down one by one.

01:13:31.370 --> 01:13:32.996
You first.

01:13:39.003 --> 01:13:41.376
Careful!

01:14:15.586 --> 01:14:18.956
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

01:14:20.967 --> 01:14:23.754
Okay, your turn.

01:14:32.729 --> 01:14:37.191
How can I eat?
I'm scum! I'm garbage!

01:14:37.319 --> 01:14:41.863
This experience has tested me and has
revealed no character whatsoever.

01:14:41.991 --> 01:14:45.241
Stop beating yourself up.
You're a guy. You can't help it.

01:14:51.043 --> 01:14:53.830
Mr Martin, forgive me.

01:14:53.921 --> 01:14:56.209
I just heard they decided
to call off the search.

01:14:56.339 --> 01:14:58.214
I'm sorry.

01:14:59.718 --> 01:15:01.628
That's it?

01:16:13.301 --> 01:16:14.581
Okay!

01:16:22.477 --> 01:16:24.021
It's working!

01:17:19.833 --> 01:17:21.162
Keep comin'!

01:17:25.964 --> 01:17:27.958
Push!

01:17:54.164 --> 01:17:56.322
- Ready?
- All right!

01:17:56.416 --> 01:17:58.492
Put her down!

01:18:41.758 --> 01:18:44.084
Oh, shit. Look!

01:19:06.912 --> 01:19:09.401
Get out of here!

01:19:11.541 --> 01:19:13.581
Too far back to the right.

01:19:27.476 --> 01:19:29.765
Oh, God. Are you okay?

01:19:32.939 --> 01:19:35.858
Oh, you're hit!

01:19:35.984 --> 01:19:38.061
It's not bad.

01:19:38.196 --> 01:19:40.272
It's not bad.

01:19:42.033 --> 01:19:44.821
Come on, come on!

01:19:46.121 --> 01:19:48.280
I'm in! I'm in!
Get in the plane! Hurry!

01:19:49.875 --> 01:19:51.868
Hurry!

01:19:59.052 --> 01:20:00.961
All right! Hurry up!

01:20:17.573 --> 01:20:20.064
Take off!
Come on!

01:20:22.745 --> 01:20:24.703
Fire!

01:20:28.793 --> 01:20:31.036
Damn! Get out of the way!

01:20:35.343 --> 01:20:38.344
Reload! Quickly!

01:20:49.943 --> 01:20:53.026
Take off! Take off!

01:20:57.826 --> 01:21:00.069
We're gonna hit 'em!

01:21:01.956 --> 01:21:04.446
We're gonna hit 'em!

01:21:04.583 --> 01:21:06.493
Gimme a hand! Pull!

01:21:06.627 --> 01:21:08.917
- Pull!
- Pull.

01:21:25.482 --> 01:21:27.807
- Look out!
- Abandon ship!

01:21:39.539 --> 01:21:42.410
Come on. Come on.
Stay with me here.

01:21:42.501 --> 01:21:45.206
Stay with me.
You're doin' great.

01:21:45.337 --> 01:21:48.422
- Come on.
- Look.

01:21:48.508 --> 01:21:51.959
I should tell you
a few things about aeroplanes.

01:21:52.053 --> 01:21:53.797
Why is that?

01:21:53.889 --> 01:21:58.468
'Cause I may not be conscious
when it comes time to land this thing.

01:21:58.602 --> 01:22:00.310
Oh, shit.

01:22:00.438 --> 01:22:04.435
Take the controls. I want you
to get a feel for the yoke.

01:22:04.525 --> 01:22:07.313
You're serious, aren't you?

01:22:09.906 --> 01:22:12.824
I got it.

01:22:12.951 --> 01:22:14.991
- Okay.
- Okay. Sm... Hey! Hey!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:22:15.079 --> 01:22:16.989
- Small corrections.
- Sorry.

01:22:17.081 --> 01:22:21.162
Small corrections.
Just look at the horizon.

01:22:21.294 --> 01:22:22.955
When we get there...

01:22:23.046 --> 01:22:26.712
you're gonna line up about
a hundred feet out from the beach.

01:22:26.841 --> 01:22:28.253
Hundred feet out from the beach.

01:22:54.456 --> 01:22:56.164
We are here today...

01:22:56.250 --> 01:22:59.417
to honour two fine people:
Miss Robin Monroe...

01:22:59.544 --> 01:23:02.001
and an old friend, Mr...

01:23:02.089 --> 01:23:07.085
Father, please forgive me, for I have
sinned. I've been bad. Very bad.

01:23:19.276 --> 01:23:20.936
Oh, God.

01:23:21.069 --> 01:23:23.904
Quinn?

01:23:24.031 --> 01:23:28.029
Quinn, don't make me do this alone.
Please, Quinn, don't make me
do this alone.

01:23:28.119 --> 01:23:29.530
Shit.

01:23:35.836 --> 01:23:38.872
I would say a few words
about our friend.

01:23:38.964 --> 01:23:41.456
Quinn Norris was the kind of man...

01:23:53.147 --> 01:23:56.563
It's Quinny! It's Quinny!

01:23:56.650 --> 01:23:59.224
Look!

01:24:02.157 --> 01:24:05.241
All right.
I'm lined up with the beach.

01:24:07.496 --> 01:24:11.114
Throttle to 65 knots.

01:24:11.250 --> 01:24:13.124
What the hell's a knot?

01:24:13.252 --> 01:24:15.459
It's Quinny! Look!

01:24:17.174 --> 01:24:20.459
Thank... Thank you, God!

01:24:20.593 --> 01:24:23.880
Uh, flaps. Flaps, flaps.

01:24:25.224 --> 01:24:26.599
All right.

01:24:26.684 --> 01:24:29.804
Nose slightly elevated for landing.
Here we go.

01:24:29.896 --> 01:24:32.980
And... Help me, God!

01:24:59.971 --> 01:25:01.679
I'm coming, Sweetie!

01:25:10.107 --> 01:25:13.856
Quinn? Quinn? Quinn!

01:25:17.073 --> 01:25:19.860
We did it.

01:25:23.914 --> 01:25:25.824
I'm coming! Robin!

01:25:25.917 --> 01:25:28.668
Sweetie, hold...

01:25:28.753 --> 01:25:32.122
Robin! Oh, my God, you're alive!

01:25:32.257 --> 01:25:34.665
- You're hurt! You're hurt!
- No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:38.094
- He needs a doctor.
Get him... Get him a doctor.
- A doctor! We need a doctor!

01:25:43.311 --> 01:25:46.396
- Come on, sweetie.
- Quinny? Are you okay, baby?

01:25:46.522 --> 01:25:49.061
- Can you move your leg?
- Be careful!

01:25:49.193 --> 01:25:51.731
- Watch out.
- Are you okay, baby?

01:25:51.862 --> 01:25:54.400
I'm okay.

01:25:54.531 --> 01:25:56.405
- Slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly.
- Be careful.

01:26:10.299 --> 01:26:13.466
- They brought the tea!
- Oh, great.

01:26:13.595 --> 01:26:15.801
You want some honey, sweetie?

01:26:15.930 --> 01:26:17.305
Sure.

01:26:17.432 --> 01:26:19.306
The guy said
the hotel's offered us...

01:26:19.434 --> 01:26:21.593
a month's free stay
anytime we want.

01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:25.020
They're probably afraid
I'm gonna sue them.

01:26:28.194 --> 01:26:32.442
- How are you feeling? Are you all right?
- Oh, yeah. I'm just, you know, tired.

01:26:37.038 --> 01:26:40.122
Here we go.
Whoops. Sorry.

01:26:40.249 --> 01:26:42.456
Are you okay?

01:26:44.754 --> 01:26:47.958
Yeah, I didn't get much sleep.

01:26:48.091 --> 01:26:50.297
Frank, Come here. Come here.

01:26:50.427 --> 01:26:51.969
Sit down.

01:26:55.683 --> 01:26:57.557
It was terrible.

01:26:57.685 --> 01:27:00.224
I mean...

01:27:00.355 --> 01:27:04.353
I think deep down, I, uh,
I never expected to see you again.

01:27:04.485 --> 01:27:06.977
You know, I was...

01:27:07.071 --> 01:27:09.527
I was lost. I was...

01:27:11.743 --> 01:27:15.112
We're just people, you know.
You know?

01:27:15.205 --> 01:27:19.583
Robin, we're not perfect. I mean,
under... under that kind of pressure...

01:27:19.710 --> 01:27:22.202
I mean, people do things.

01:27:22.339 --> 01:27:25.007
You don't know... right, wrong...
You're cra... You're nuts.

01:27:25.091 --> 01:27:27.084
You know, you...

01:27:54.332 --> 01:27:55.827
Hi.

01:27:55.917 --> 01:27:58.622
Hi.

01:28:00.672 --> 01:28:02.001
Keepin' busy?

01:28:03.550 --> 01:28:05.959
Yeah.

01:28:06.095 --> 01:28:08.053
How are you?

01:28:08.140 --> 01:28:11.306
Good. Good, thanks.
This is not so bad.

01:28:11.434 --> 01:28:13.178
- How 'bout you, your...
- It's fine.

01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:14.978
Good.

01:28:19.945 --> 01:28:23.028
What's the deal here?

01:28:23.114 --> 01:28:27.064
- Deal?
- With us.

01:28:29.955 --> 01:28:31.912
What do you mean?

01:28:31.999 --> 01:28:33.825
You know what I mean.

01:28:44.304 --> 01:28:47.258
Was what happened
on that island anything?

01:28:49.393 --> 01:28:51.267
Or was it just something
that happens to two people...

01:28:51.395 --> 01:28:54.101
when they're alone
on an island together?

01:28:56.151 --> 01:28:58.060
It was something.

01:29:00.488 --> 01:29:02.565
Something?

01:29:02.658 --> 01:29:03.939
Yeah.

01:29:05.328 --> 01:29:08.114
So...

01:29:08.247 --> 01:29:10.121
now what?

01:29:12.836 --> 01:29:16.455
Look, I'm... I'm pretty set
in my ways, and...

01:29:16.549 --> 01:29:18.790
you got all kinds
of possibilities.

01:29:18.926 --> 01:29:21.002
You deserve someone...

01:29:22.639 --> 01:29:23.967
fresher.

01:29:26.143 --> 01:29:29.477
Don't you think
that's up to me to decide?

01:29:30.647 --> 01:29:33.317
Let's be smart about this.

01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:36.817
You're not gonna move out here
and become my copilot.

01:29:36.904 --> 01:29:40.275
And I'm not gonna go to New York
and be your receptionist, so...

01:29:43.411 --> 01:29:45.950
Where does that leave us?

01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:48.613
I don't know.
I guess it leaves us nowhere.

01:29:50.045 --> 01:29:52.832
So let's not complicate things.

01:29:53.965 --> 01:29:56.800
Oh, I forgot
you like things simple.

01:29:58.387 --> 01:29:59.668
Right.

01:29:59.764 --> 01:30:01.673
All right.

01:30:13.403 --> 01:30:16.274
Well, good luck.

01:30:17.908 --> 01:30:19.866
Good luck to you too.

01:30:21.621 --> 01:30:24.788
I hope everything works out...

01:30:24.916 --> 01:30:26.790
for you.

01:30:32.342 --> 01:30:35.378
So, how's that shoulder today?

01:30:35.470 --> 01:30:37.713
Need something for the pain?

01:30:37.848 --> 01:30:39.757
Yeah.

01:31:03.626 --> 01:31:06.663
Well, 14 more hours,
then back to reality.

01:31:11.301 --> 01:31:13.757
- Frank?
- Hmm?

01:31:13.845 --> 01:31:17.012
I don't think
we should get married.

01:31:17.141 --> 01:31:19.467
What?

01:31:19.602 --> 01:31:22.177
How come?

01:31:22.314 --> 01:31:25.150
Because I think it's wrong
for two people...

01:31:25.275 --> 01:31:28.442
to get married when something is
hanging over their heads.

01:31:30.656 --> 01:31:32.696
Oh, my God, I'm sorry!
Robin, I'm sorry!

01:31:32.825 --> 01:31:35.151
I was... I was...
I was distraught.

01:31:35.287 --> 01:31:38.038
And then she-she took off her blouse,
and it was like, "Oh, my God."

01:31:38.164 --> 01:31:40.371
But I...
I walked away. I did.

01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:43.171
I went back to our room. I tried
to go to sleep, but I thought of you.

01:31:43.296 --> 01:31:46.167
I thought, oh... I didn't know
if you were dead or what.

01:31:46.299 --> 01:31:49.134
So I went back to her bungalow,
you know, just... just to...

01:31:49.219 --> 01:31:52.303
And she...
Robin, she answered the door with...

01:31:54.433 --> 01:31:55.975
On.

01:31:56.060 --> 01:31:57.969
- Who?
- Angelica.

01:31:59.105 --> 01:32:02.640
- You slept with Angelica?
- Who slept? Are you ki...

01:32:04.652 --> 01:32:07.488
- Didn't you know?
- How would I know?

01:32:09.283 --> 01:32:11.524
Wait a minute. You just said
there was something hanging over our...

01:32:11.660 --> 01:32:13.534
What did...
Wh-What do you mean?

01:32:15.331 --> 01:32:16.611
Quinn and me.

01:32:16.707 --> 01:32:19.460
- Aha!
- Oh, Frank...

01:32:19.545 --> 01:32:21.834
something happened.

01:32:21.963 --> 01:32:26.127
Something happened that shouldn't have
happened if you and I were really...

01:32:26.218 --> 01:32:28.127
In love.

01:32:51.413 --> 01:32:54.829
Boarding flight number 58
to Honolulu.

01:32:54.917 --> 01:32:58.203
All ticketed passengers
should board immediately.

01:33:46.641 --> 01:33:48.550
- Hey!
- Sorry.

01:33:49.645 --> 01:33:51.519
Hey!

01:33:58.529 --> 01:34:00.855
Hey, hey.

01:34:00.991 --> 01:34:03.861
- Where's the plane... plane to New York?
- Right there.

01:34:36.238 --> 01:34:39.156
I-I'm sorry.
I just had to get off the plane.

01:34:39.284 --> 01:34:41.774
Well, I'm sorry
I delayed the flight. I just...

01:34:50.003 --> 01:34:55.674
Where are my bags?
You don't speak any English?

01:34:59.223 --> 01:35:01.594
What's in my bags is illegal?

01:35:01.725 --> 01:35:04.097
Wait a minute.
Oh, please don't search my bags.

01:35:04.227 --> 01:35:06.304
It's just important
that I stay.

01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:17.113
You're here!

01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:32.841
Why... Why did you
get off the plane?

01:35:32.926 --> 01:35:35.632
Wh-Why didn't you...
Why did you come here?

01:35:37.599 --> 01:35:40.884
I've decided
my life is too simple.

01:35:42.228 --> 01:35:43.687
It is?

01:35:43.771 --> 01:35:47.722
Yeah. I w... I want to
c-complicate the hell out of it.

01:36:04.669 --> 01:36:07.042
So, uh, where are we goin'?

01:36:07.131 --> 01:36:10.168
Um, your place is
in New York, right?

01:36:10.301 --> 01:36:11.761
Uh-huh.

01:36:11.887 --> 01:36:14.258
I don't think I can wait that long.
How 'bout my place?

01:36:14.388 --> 01:36:16.963
Oh, yeah. Your little house
on the beach.

01:36:17.100 --> 01:36:19.259
More like a shack, actually.

01:36:19.395 --> 01:36:22.313
- A shack.
- It's, uh... It's not much.

01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:25.311
Uh-huh. You do have a bed,
don't you?

01:36:25.443 --> 01:36:27.483
Are you gonna be this fussy
about everything?

01:36:27.611 --> 01:36:29.521
I wanna love ya

01:36:31.033 --> 01:36:33.440
And treat you right

01:36:33.577 --> 01:36:35.451
I wanna love ya

01:36:37.915 --> 01:36:40.787
Every day and every night

01:36:40.919 --> 01:36:43.291
We'll be together

01:36:45.841 --> 01:36:48.794
With a roof right over our head

01:36:48.927 --> 01:36:51.383
We'll share the shelter

01:36:54.267 --> 01:36:56.805
Of my single bed

01:36:56.895 --> 01:37:00.145
We'll share the same room, yeah

01:37:02.026 --> 01:37:05.395
But Jah provide the bread

01:37:05.530 --> 01:37:08.365
Is this love, is this love
is this love
