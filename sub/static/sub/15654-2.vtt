00:05.520 --> 00:09.120
They've found your girl Grace.
She was murdered, Bill.

00:09.200 --> 00:10.400
<i>Her and Adam Elliot.</i>

00:10.480 --> 00:13.240
I need to get to Braeston.
Finish something that I started.

00:13.320 --> 00:14.400
[tires screech]

00:14.480 --> 00:16.920
[Alastair]<i> This is the man</i>
<i>that killed Adam and Gracie.</i>

00:17.000 --> 00:19.520
-So what now?
-[Rob]<i> The old dog cages in Bill's barn.</i>

00:19.600 --> 00:21.960
[Bill]<i> He's right. We could keep him</i>
<i>in there and we'd be safe.</i>

00:22.040 --> 00:23.720
[thunder]

00:23.800 --> 00:25.720
[Bill]<i> One of us did this.</i>

00:27.360 --> 00:29.560
One of us, right here.

00:30.240 --> 00:32.960
Papa Smurfs, LSD, 75 sheets.

00:33.040 --> 00:35.760
We have to take precautions.
Someone like you.

00:35.840 --> 00:39.280
The Elliot case. A local cop
got a sighting of Lee Walsh.

00:39.360 --> 00:40.560
Get him on the phone now.

00:40.640 --> 00:43.320
-A detective's coming from Edinburgh.
-[Rob] What are we going to do?

01:52.320 --> 01:56.120
Look, whoever did this
just has to say so.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.720
You just have to admit it.

02:00.680 --> 02:02.320
I'm not so sure it matters.

02:04.800 --> 02:08.960
What that man did...
he hurt all of us.

02:09.039 --> 02:11.320
So we deal with this ourselves.

02:14.720 --> 02:16.520
We all carry it on our shoulders.

02:16.600 --> 02:19.920
Look, we don't even know why
that man came here.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.400
We don't know why he had
our postcode in his pocket.

02:22.480 --> 02:24.480
What matters is what we do now.

02:26.960 --> 02:29.760
And I just keep asking myself,

02:29.840 --> 02:32.680
am I sorry that this man is dead?

02:34.680 --> 02:35.960
After what he did?

02:38.280 --> 02:39.280
Mm?

02:41.160 --> 02:43.240
I honestly cannot say that I am.

02:47.400 --> 02:48.640
Mum...

02:50.240 --> 02:51.840
You're just in shock.

02:52.760 --> 02:54.360
[distant voice] Hello?

03:24.480 --> 03:26.640
Hello!

03:26.720 --> 03:27.960
-Do you know them, Bill?
-No.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.600
Excuse me, can I help you?

03:30.680 --> 03:32.480
-Hey!
-No, I'm sorry.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.320
Put your camera down!

03:34.400 --> 03:36.320
It wasn't my intention
to barge in like this.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.800
-Who are you?
-Monica Grant.<i> Edinburgh Times.</i>

03:38.880 --> 03:41.480
I assure you,
we won't be using those photographs.

03:41.560 --> 03:43.360
-Then what are you doing here?
-Bill Douglas?

03:43.440 --> 03:46.680
We've got nothing to say to you.
This is a private matter.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.120
All we want is to give you a place

03:48.200 --> 03:50.640
to really talk about your daughter,
to tell her story.

03:50.720 --> 03:53.320
This is private land. Get lost.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.920
I understand. Really.
Sorry to have disturbed you.

04:00.560 --> 04:02.840
You've got to be joking!

04:02.920 --> 04:04.280
-Who were they?
-The press.

04:04.360 --> 04:06.120
-What did they want?
-What do you think?

04:06.200 --> 04:08.040
-Well, I'm just asking.
-What did they want?

04:08.120 --> 04:12.720
-What if more come?
-We should call Charlie Fuller.

04:12.800 --> 04:14.320
Tell him to keep the press
at the gate.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.600
-We can't have them up here.
-I'll go.

04:16.680 --> 04:19.000
Aye, and after that, Alastair,
you can go on home.

04:19.079 --> 04:21.800
You've done enough.
Sal will be wondering where you are.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.360
You know, the police
could be here any minute.

04:26.440 --> 04:28.040
What are we going to do?

05:08.680 --> 05:13.320
-And that's last night's footage?
-Aye.

05:18.960 --> 05:21.440
Let me know if you want
to join in at any point.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.960
Eighteen miles
from where the families live.

05:30.040 --> 05:32.080
No way Lee Walsh being out here
was a coincidence.

05:32.160 --> 05:34.160
Are we sure the families are safe?

05:34.240 --> 05:36.320
The liaison in Braeston's a local.

05:36.400 --> 05:39.040
He knows the Douglases
and the Elliots well.

05:39.120 --> 05:41.720
He's got all his men
keeping their eyes open.

05:47.800 --> 05:50.880
[Andrew] This is the shittiest
petrol station I've ever been to.

05:50.960 --> 05:53.720
Where the hell even is this?

05:53.800 --> 05:56.960
-What?
-Lee Walsh's medical records.

05:57.040 --> 06:00.840
Guy's been in and out of facilities
since he was a teenager.

06:00.920 --> 06:03.400
Diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic.

06:03.480 --> 06:06.920
A homeless schizophrenic
in a stolen Lexus.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.400
I wouldn't have thought
he'd be too hard to find.

06:10.480 --> 06:14.240
Question is,
if he was here last night,

06:14.320 --> 06:16.680
why didn't he make it to Braeston?

06:16.760 --> 06:18.960
That storm did a lot of damage.

06:19.040 --> 06:21.000
People having to evacuate
their houses,

06:21.080 --> 06:24.200
emergency services phones
ringing off the hook. Maybe...

06:24.280 --> 06:26.560
Maybe he came off the road.

06:26.640 --> 06:28.360
Yeah, we'll find him soon enough.

06:28.440 --> 06:32.960
-Come on. We've got to see the families.
-[phone rings]

06:34.680 --> 06:35.680
Yep?

06:36.720 --> 06:37.720
OK.

06:40.960 --> 06:42.640
Sounds like we might have
a connection

06:42.720 --> 06:44.520
between Walsh and the victims.

06:45.440 --> 06:46.440
Yeah, go on.

07:28.520 --> 07:31.320
Some of this stuff here,
put it around, just make it look like...

07:31.400 --> 07:33.640
-What?
-It's been there for ages. OK?

07:43.560 --> 07:45.960
[Anna] We're doing the right thing.

07:46.040 --> 07:47.280
[Claire] How can you be so sure?

07:48.920 --> 07:50.920
Because Rob's sure.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.400
And... I believe in him.

07:56.040 --> 07:59.200
After everything that happened,
he looked after me.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.000
I trust him.

08:05.440 --> 08:08.400
I loved Adam and Grace too.

08:10.360 --> 08:14.720
Two weeks ago,
I was Grace's bridesmaid and now...

08:15.960 --> 08:17.520
she's gone.

08:19.400 --> 08:21.320
As far as I'm concerned,

08:21.920 --> 08:24.560
Lee Walsh getting killed,
that is karma.

08:29.760 --> 08:31.880
I'm gonna go and help the others.

09:00.520 --> 09:02.200
-Yeah?
-Yeah, OK.

09:05.640 --> 09:06.640
The fence.

09:08.240 --> 09:09.520
What can we do?

09:09.600 --> 09:12.280
Car's done, the tire tracks
are pretty well covered,

09:12.360 --> 09:14.320
but we just need to move
that branch out the road

09:14.400 --> 09:15.520
then get this fence back up.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.480
Mum, wait, wait.
Let's do the branch first.

09:29.800 --> 09:32.360
DI Juliet Wallis,
my partner, DS Andrew Barker.

09:32.440 --> 09:34.680
-We spoke on the phone.
-[Rob]<i> Lift!</i>

09:39.120 --> 09:41.960
Further. OK, that'll do.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.800
-OK.
-That's it.

09:43.880 --> 09:46.520
-Ow! Shit!
-What happened?

09:46.600 --> 09:48.640
I cut it on a branch, it's fine.

09:48.720 --> 09:51.000
-You've got to put something on it.
-No, when we're done!

09:51.080 --> 09:53.080
[car approaches]

09:57.800 --> 09:59.040
They're here.

10:00.080 --> 10:01.240
They're here!

10:01.320 --> 10:02.920
Run, run.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.200
No, leave them. Come on. Don't. Just run.

10:29.560 --> 10:31.560
[knocking at door]

10:36.480 --> 10:39.120
-[Juliet] Louise Elliot?
-Yes, that's me.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.360
Detective Wallis and Barker.

10:41.440 --> 10:45.320
Yes, of course. Yes.
Charlie told me you were coming.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.680
Come in. Come in.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.320
[Juliet] As Officer Fuller has told you,
our prime suspect is Lee Walsh.

10:54.400 --> 10:57.120
His fingerprints were found
at the crime scene.

10:57.200 --> 10:59.680
Do any of you know him?
Have a good look.

11:08.880 --> 11:09.880
Sorry.

11:17.640 --> 11:19.720
[Rob] Why?

11:19.800 --> 11:23.480
I mean, do you have any idea
why he would do something like this?

11:23.560 --> 11:25.280
Nothing for sure.

11:25.360 --> 11:27.440
We did get a call from Edinburgh
on the way here.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.960
Walsh is currently homeless

11:29.040 --> 11:32.480
and used to go to a couple of
soup kitchens in Edinburgh.

11:32.560 --> 11:36.600
We're wondering if Grace and Walsh
maybe came into contact there.

11:36.680 --> 11:39.520
Did she or Adam maybe
ever talk about someone

11:39.600 --> 11:42.200
she might have met there
on one of her shifts?

11:42.280 --> 11:43.280
No.

11:44.840 --> 11:49.560
Again, why? It doesn't make sense.
Even if their paths crossed,

11:49.640 --> 11:52.200
-why would he go to their house...?
-[Rob] We can't be sure.

11:52.280 --> 11:55.800
Walsh is a diagnosed schizophrenic
with a history of drug use.

11:55.880 --> 11:58.080
Always coming off his medication.

11:58.160 --> 12:00.720
It wouldn't be the first time
he's had delusional thoughts

12:00.800 --> 12:02.280
and became hostile.

12:02.360 --> 12:05.080
He's got a bunch of serious
assault charges on his sheet.

12:05.160 --> 12:08.280
This is just a theory right now,
nothing more.

12:09.840 --> 12:12.520
-Where do you think he is now?
-[Juliet] As of this morning,

12:12.600 --> 12:16.120
we have CCTV footage placing him
very close to here,

12:16.200 --> 12:19.520
in a service station off the A87.

12:19.600 --> 12:21.840
With him being this close
to the house,

12:21.920 --> 12:25.760
we have to entertain the idea that
Lee Walsh maybe was coming here.

12:25.840 --> 12:27.280
[Claire] Why?

12:27.360 --> 12:29.360
Why would he do that?

12:29.440 --> 12:31.000
Right now, we just don't know.

12:31.080 --> 12:35.360
We're thinking some kind of
delusional hostility towards Grace,

12:35.440 --> 12:37.800
extending to the new husband,
the families...

12:37.880 --> 12:42.920
At this stage, anything we say
can only be... speculation.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.720
What you need to know is
we're not gonna take any chances.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.440
We're going to have
an iron fence up,

12:47.520 --> 12:49.960
officers at various checkpoints,
monitoring the road in

12:50.040 --> 12:52.000
to ensure you're not in any danger.
Now...

12:54.040 --> 12:58.160
Was there anything unusual
about Adam and Grace's behavior

12:58.240 --> 13:00.000
in recent months?

13:00.080 --> 13:03.040
Anything at all out of the ordinary?

13:03.120 --> 13:04.880
Doesn't matter how small it seems.

13:04.960 --> 13:06.480
[Louise] I'm sorry, I don't get this.

13:06.560 --> 13:07.840
Why?

13:07.920 --> 13:11.240
I mean, a man walked into their flat
and killed them.

13:11.320 --> 13:13.160
Aren't they the victims here?

13:13.240 --> 13:14.760
Mrs. Elliot, please.

13:14.840 --> 13:17.280
I'm just trying to get
the full picture here.

13:17.360 --> 13:18.920
I'm sorry. We've been...

13:19.000 --> 13:22.560
You know, we've been
stuck in the house all morning,

13:22.640 --> 13:24.480
since we got up, and, you know,

13:24.560 --> 13:28.360
we're just staring at the television
and hearing report after report

13:28.440 --> 13:31.000
and hearing it all out loud,
it's just too much.

13:31.080 --> 13:34.120
I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm sorry. [sobs]

13:47.880 --> 13:49.000
Oh, Mum.

13:57.600 --> 14:01.120
She was always trying
to do good things, Grace.

14:02.760 --> 14:04.600
Always trying to save the world.

14:05.840 --> 14:07.480
One lost soul at a time.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.000
And what does she get?

14:11.080 --> 14:14.280
Some psychopath, obsessed with her
because she's kind enough

14:14.360 --> 14:15.960
to hand him some free food.

14:16.040 --> 14:18.080
You can't keep thinking about that.

14:22.720 --> 14:25.080
So if that detective is right,

14:25.160 --> 14:27.720
and that man was coming here to hurt us,

14:27.800 --> 14:30.440
just like he did Adam and Grace,
then...

14:31.280 --> 14:33.880
Then we did the right thing.

14:37.080 --> 14:39.800
Mum... was it you?

14:42.280 --> 14:44.400
Did you go into the barn last night?

14:48.200 --> 14:49.520
Me?

14:53.840 --> 14:55.200
Why would you say that?

14:55.280 --> 14:58.320
You do realize
we are not made for this.

14:58.400 --> 15:01.240
You just told the police
we were here all morning,

15:01.320 --> 15:03.480
even though
we were at Bill and Moira's

15:03.560 --> 15:05.000
and people saw us there.

15:07.480 --> 15:10.000
Well, no one's stopping you.

15:10.080 --> 15:13.760
If you want to go back into that room
and tell the detective what happened,

15:13.840 --> 15:15.880
no one's going to stand in your way.

15:29.040 --> 15:32.360
[Anna] I saw Grace about once a week...

15:32.440 --> 15:35.840
I'm sorry. I, um...

15:39.280 --> 15:40.840
I, uh...

15:43.560 --> 15:47.360
Um, I have a shift at work.
Excuse me?

15:47.440 --> 15:49.360
[Rob] They can't expect you to work today.

15:49.440 --> 15:52.080
[Claire] There's no one to cover.
If that's all, detectives...

15:52.160 --> 15:56.320
Of course. Just before you go,
while I have you all here,

15:56.400 --> 16:00.840
you haven't heard from your dad,
have you? We can't get through.

16:00.920 --> 16:04.760
Me neither. I tried calling
after we heard but...

16:06.200 --> 16:08.680
We... we don't speak to him anymore.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.520
Haven't for a long time.

16:36.440 --> 16:39.200
[reporters shouting]

16:53.320 --> 16:55.600
[phone rings]

16:55.680 --> 17:00.120
<i>Hi, you've reached Adam Elliot.</i>
<i>Go crazy, leave a message.</i>

17:02.760 --> 17:03.760
I miss you.

17:10.400 --> 17:11.920
[hangs up]

17:19.240 --> 17:22.280
OK, let's talk to the Douglases
and get back to Edinburgh,

17:22.359 --> 17:24.000
follow up on that soup kitchen lead.

17:24.079 --> 17:27.680
Christ, that was full on, wasn't it?
Don't think I'll ever get used to it.

17:27.760 --> 17:29.000
[Juliet] What?

17:29.080 --> 17:31.080
[Andrew] Being around it,
that amount of grief.

17:31.160 --> 17:33.080
It's just exhausting.

17:33.160 --> 17:35.360
Imagine living in a house
that much bloody tragedy.

17:35.440 --> 17:37.400
[phone rings]

17:37.480 --> 17:39.880
-Hello?
<i>-It's Jay.</i>

17:39.960 --> 17:42.840
-What the hell are you doing calling me?
<i>-Chill out, Grandma.</i>

17:42.920 --> 17:47.640
Look, I just thought you should know,
those sheets of acid you got me,

17:47.720 --> 17:50.000
the Papa Smurfs?

17:50.080 --> 17:54.320
Flying off the shelves.
It's like the late '80s out there.

17:54.400 --> 17:57.200
I'm looking at the numbers
on my screen now,

17:57.280 --> 18:00.600
I'm pulling down bigger than
I thought and I need more.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.040
Screen? What, are you running
a bloody spreadsheet?

18:03.120 --> 18:05.120
[Jay laughs]<i> What?</i>

18:05.200 --> 18:08.920
<i>Cos you think I make money</i>
<i>selling drugs, I'm a dumb shit?</i>

18:09.000 --> 18:11.920
Well, a dumb shit who I reckon
makes double what you earn

18:12.000 --> 18:13.160
in half the time.

18:13.240 --> 18:16.400
Tell me, what do they pay you,
Grandma?

18:16.480 --> 18:19.680
We're not doing this.
We're not having a conversation.

18:19.760 --> 18:22.640
Get that through your head.
That's not what this is.

18:22.720 --> 18:24.360
It was a one-off thing. End of.

18:24.440 --> 18:26.120
Do not call this number again.

19:09.360 --> 19:11.280
What's happening?

19:12.560 --> 19:15.000
-You need to tell me.
-Never you mind. You've done enough.

19:15.080 --> 19:18.600
-Moira...
-No, I'm sick and tired of it! Just...

19:18.680 --> 19:21.800
Just go up to your room, Jamie,
and stay out of the way.

19:21.880 --> 19:24.440
You wish it was me, don't you?

19:24.520 --> 19:26.480
Me that wasn't here,
instead of Grace.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.440
[Bill] Jamie, stop provoking your mother.

19:28.520 --> 19:30.160
How dare you?

19:31.400 --> 19:32.560
After we lied for you!

19:32.640 --> 19:34.000
I wasn't trying...

19:34.080 --> 19:36.120
Do you not think the police
are going to look at you

19:36.200 --> 19:37.640
after the things that you've done?

19:37.720 --> 19:40.320
They're going to find out that
you took your father's shotgun

19:40.400 --> 19:42.760
into school and they're going
to start digging.

19:42.840 --> 19:45.400
I was trying to scare someone,
that's all I did.

19:45.480 --> 19:47.040
I didn't kill that man out there.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.520
-So you say! Jamie, I...
-[Bill] Stop it. Stop!

19:54.320 --> 19:57.560
Let's just... Let's just try and get
through the next hour or so, OK?

19:57.640 --> 19:59.280
[Moira] And then what?

20:10.480 --> 20:12.360
-Dad...
-Go on.

20:12.440 --> 20:14.080
Go on, get your arse upstairs.

20:14.160 --> 20:17.480
-Dad, is it happening again?
-Jamie, do as you're told.

20:19.200 --> 20:21.040
You told me you'd say something.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.800
And you told me that
it would stay between us.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.520
It will.

20:30.720 --> 20:32.560
Everything will be alright.

20:49.960 --> 20:51.520
[knocking]

20:54.080 --> 20:55.840
Ant, mate, jump in.

21:00.600 --> 21:02.480
This is for you.

21:03.280 --> 21:06.240
I'd go round my nan's
if I wanted an antique, brother.

21:06.320 --> 21:07.640
No, no, no, no, no.

21:07.720 --> 21:11.240
You see, the battery lasts forever,
and most importantly,

21:11.320 --> 21:12.840
the coppers can't track you.

21:12.920 --> 21:14.400
Right, take that.

21:16.360 --> 21:17.760
OK...

21:18.760 --> 21:20.920
I'm going to give you four of these.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.800
Two K, right? 400 a sheet.

21:23.880 --> 21:26.160
-What did I say?
-Two K.

21:26.240 --> 21:28.120
-How much a sheet?
-400 a sheet.

21:28.200 --> 21:29.200
Good.

21:31.680 --> 21:34.680
Have a nice day at the office,
then, sweetheart.

21:39.160 --> 21:41.600
[Sal]<i> So, how are Bill and Moira?</i>

21:42.800 --> 21:44.200
As you'd expect.

21:44.280 --> 21:47.320
I still can't believe it, and having
to put you up for the night's

21:47.400 --> 21:49.480
the last thing they needed,
I imagine.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.040
There was no choice, love.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.600
Aye.

21:57.680 --> 22:00.120
The high street here
was half underwater.

22:00.200 --> 22:01.520
Cars all went for a swim.

22:01.600 --> 22:03.360
Something happened, love.

22:06.040 --> 22:07.200
Last night.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.320
And you ought to know.

22:14.240 --> 22:15.800
[knocking at door]

22:15.880 --> 22:17.440
[door opens]

22:20.480 --> 22:22.840
What on earth are you doing here?

22:22.920 --> 22:24.640
I had a shift.

22:24.720 --> 22:29.640
I saw it on the news this morning,
about your brother and sister-in-law.

22:29.720 --> 22:31.480
You shouldn't be here.

22:31.560 --> 22:33.120
I wanted to.

22:36.800 --> 22:38.320
How are you coping?

22:40.120 --> 22:41.760
I, um...

22:41.840 --> 22:43.120
I honestly don't know.

22:44.160 --> 22:46.080
[Meredith]
There's no sense to be found in loss.

22:47.520 --> 22:51.600
Especially one as awful
and downright senseless as yours.

22:57.240 --> 22:59.120
[sobs]

22:59.200 --> 23:01.280
Oh, darling...

23:05.200 --> 23:06.200
Oh...

23:12.600 --> 23:15.200
And the...
And the body is still there now?

23:15.280 --> 23:17.520
Aye. In the barn.

23:19.320 --> 23:20.480
So...

23:21.920 --> 23:24.360
nobody has any idea
why he came to the farm?

23:24.440 --> 23:25.800
Nobody recognized him.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.480
But you saw Jamie go in there.

23:29.560 --> 23:32.120
-Do you think he could've done it?
-[sighs]

23:32.200 --> 23:35.360
I honestly don't know, love.
I don't know.

23:35.440 --> 23:38.040
What were you doing outside?
How did you come to see him?

23:38.760 --> 23:40.160
I...

23:42.520 --> 23:44.040
I went outside for a smoke.

23:45.680 --> 23:47.240
You didn't go into that barn, did you?

23:49.880 --> 23:52.480
-Of course not.
-You've killed before.

23:52.560 --> 23:54.640
It meant nothing,
you've said it yourself.

23:54.720 --> 23:58.080
In war. It's different in war.
It's not the same.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.480
-You know it's not the...
-OK. OK, then.

24:03.560 --> 24:05.600
I just had to be sure.

24:07.440 --> 24:09.600
Because if you didn't do it...

24:12.000 --> 24:14.600
I know what you need to do now.

24:15.600 --> 24:18.200
If you've got the stomach for it.

24:43.600 --> 24:45.440
[engine starts]

24:56.920 --> 24:59.720
Bill? What happened?
What did they say?

24:59.800 --> 25:01.080
[Bill] We didn't say anything.

25:01.160 --> 25:03.520
Yeah, but how did they seem
when they were talking to you?

25:03.600 --> 25:07.800
Concerned. They were asking
about that man, that's all.

25:11.960 --> 25:13.160
What about the car?

25:13.240 --> 25:15.440
[Rob] We covered it up,
they didn't see it.

25:15.520 --> 25:17.680
I said that we were
at the house all morning,

25:17.760 --> 25:20.200
and that photographer
took a picture of us.

25:20.280 --> 25:22.840
-Stop worrying about that.
-That's fine. Really, Mum, OK?

25:22.920 --> 25:25.160
If they print it we just say
that you got it wrong,

25:25.240 --> 25:26.640
and we all went for a walk.

25:27.720 --> 25:31.400
We're all upset, OK? That's the truth.

25:31.480 --> 25:33.480
None of us are thinking right.

25:33.560 --> 25:35.080
Where's Claire?

25:35.160 --> 25:37.320
She went to work.
When the police were still there.

25:37.400 --> 25:38.520
[Bill] And you let her?

25:38.600 --> 25:40.440
She's a grown-up.
What am I supposed to do?

25:40.520 --> 25:41.840
[Moira] Well, it's done now.

25:41.920 --> 25:45.000
Whoever killed that man, it...

25:45.080 --> 25:46.600
It doesn't matter. We've all lied.

25:47.840 --> 25:49.320
We just have to see it through.

25:50.120 --> 25:52.560
What do you mean, see it through?

25:56.840 --> 25:58.600
[Rob] She's right.

25:59.640 --> 26:01.240
We have to get rid of the body.

26:06.160 --> 26:07.800
What about the car?

26:08.800 --> 26:11.800
[Louise] Well, we can't just drive it out
because the press are by the gate

26:11.880 --> 26:13.840
at the top of the drive

26:13.920 --> 26:17.440
and the police said they were putting
officers all round the farm.

26:17.520 --> 26:20.000
Isn't there a lake or something,

26:20.080 --> 26:23.120
or another gate so we could go
through that instead?

26:23.200 --> 26:27.120
No, we're hemmed in by mountains,
and we're at the deep end of the glen.

26:27.200 --> 26:29.040
The only way out
is through that front gate.

26:29.120 --> 26:32.000
[Moira] Well, can't we just leave it
where it is, under the tarpaulin?

26:32.080 --> 26:35.160
But what if the police come back?
What if they look around?

26:35.240 --> 26:37.080
I don't know, set it on fire?

26:37.160 --> 26:39.680
What, and let out
a smoke signal for people to see?

26:39.760 --> 26:41.040
I'm just trying to...

26:41.120 --> 26:43.240
Even if we set it on fire
the thing wouldn't burn

26:43.320 --> 26:46.080
all the way down, Moira.
I'm sorry, it's a bad idea.

26:46.160 --> 26:48.920
Oh, Jesus Christ, what are we doing?

26:50.080 --> 26:52.920
This is just... I can't...

26:57.760 --> 26:59.560
Does that thing still work, Bill?

29:15.760 --> 29:19.360
[woman] Well, his sister did IVF,
of course. It nearly bankrupted them.

29:21.480 --> 29:24.000
No, last I heard there wasn't
any news but...

29:25.520 --> 29:26.800
[chuckles]

29:26.880 --> 29:28.760
[faint sobs]

29:29.680 --> 29:31.640
Lucy, sorry, can I call you back?

29:33.080 --> 29:35.240
OK, thanks.

29:41.760 --> 29:42.800
Peter!

29:43.840 --> 29:45.240
Peter, what?

29:47.320 --> 29:50.200
I was going to tell you.
I meant to tell you.

29:50.280 --> 29:51.400
Tell me what?

29:51.480 --> 29:53.880
But things just kept
getting in the way.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.560
We were so happy.

29:56.840 --> 29:58.960
Just didn't seem the time.

30:00.080 --> 30:01.280
What?

30:02.160 --> 30:05.680
Peter, what are you on about?
You're scaring me.

30:05.760 --> 30:09.320
I love you. You know that, don't you?

30:11.520 --> 30:13.120
Peter, just tell me what's going on.

30:16.120 --> 30:18.120
Before you...

30:18.200 --> 30:20.160
there was someone else.

30:21.640 --> 30:23.360
Before you, I...

30:27.040 --> 30:28.320
I had a family.

30:31.120 --> 30:32.920
A wife and three kids.

30:35.360 --> 30:36.800
And work was...

30:37.920 --> 30:40.080
It doesn't really matter.

30:40.160 --> 30:43.760
I had a sort of
stress breakdown thing

30:43.840 --> 30:46.920
and we moved to Scotland
to try and make it work.

30:48.240 --> 30:49.800
It didn't.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.600
I left.

30:58.200 --> 31:00.160
And when I met you, I was...

31:00.240 --> 31:02.960
I was just trying start again and move on.

31:03.040 --> 31:06.360
That's all it was. That's the only
reason I didn't tell you.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.440
Then when we got back, I saw this.

31:17.760 --> 31:19.480
He's my son, Leah.

31:21.960 --> 31:24.440
My little boy was murdered.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.280
Alright.

31:59.320 --> 32:00.840
-Front?
-Front, yeah.

32:06.920 --> 32:08.920
That's it.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.360
That's it, I've got him.
I've got him.

32:12.440 --> 32:14.680
Alright, I've got him.

32:31.760 --> 32:33.880
Let's go. Push!

32:49.920 --> 32:51.320
Push!

33:20.400 --> 33:21.960
-Are you...?
-Ant.

33:23.360 --> 33:25.160
So, what are we in the market for?

33:25.240 --> 33:27.440
Sounded proper cryptic on the phone.

33:27.520 --> 33:28.680
Acid.

33:28.760 --> 33:30.920
Fourteen tabs, if you can.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.720
See, I'm going camping
with some mates.

33:32.800 --> 33:34.360
It's one of their birthdays, so...

33:34.440 --> 33:36.960
I didnae ask for your life story, pal.

33:37.040 --> 33:38.360
That'll be 140.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.360
Sorry, I'm not used to doing this.

33:56.440 --> 33:58.360
No, really?

34:00.800 --> 34:02.720
Well, buzz me if you need
anything else.

34:02.800 --> 34:05.160
Oh, and enjoy your trip.

34:05.240 --> 34:06.520
Both of them.

34:14.520 --> 34:16.120
Alright, sis?

34:17.480 --> 34:20.880
I don't know. Jesus, you're like
a bloody broken record.

34:22.639 --> 34:26.000
Aye, feel like we're kids again
with our first pack of cigarettes.

34:28.560 --> 34:30.520
Right. Fourteen.

34:32.480 --> 34:34.840
They've got a bloody Smurf
on them all.

34:37.639 --> 34:39.719
Right. I'll see you tomorrow.

34:45.040 --> 34:46.840
You still going on your trip, then?

34:46.920 --> 34:48.639
Work let me off.

34:48.719 --> 34:51.880
-You sure I can't come?
-It's just camping.

34:52.560 --> 34:54.880
I know what you're doing there.
I don't mind, I can...

34:54.960 --> 34:57.560
No! Anyway, you just want to see Damien.

34:57.640 --> 35:00.000
You know you're a wee bit
too young for him, right?

35:00.080 --> 35:01.080
Shut up.

35:01.160 --> 35:03.600
Anyway, Gran will be here
tomorrow afternoon.

35:03.680 --> 35:04.720
You'll be OK, yeah?

35:04.800 --> 35:07.560
Get yourself a pizza.
I'll leave money on the side.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.760
Craig. I don't like Damien.

35:10.840 --> 35:13.480
I just thought it'd be good
to hang out with you.

35:13.560 --> 35:15.000
We'll go to the cinema
when I'm back.

35:15.080 --> 35:17.000
Anything you want to see.

35:17.080 --> 35:18.320
Right.

35:47.320 --> 35:49.600
[tires screech]

35:58.680 --> 36:01.880
-Jesus! Are you alright?
-Yeah, sorry, I didn't hear you.

36:02.720 --> 36:04.600
What are you doing out here?

36:04.680 --> 36:06.480
Just... walking.

36:11.080 --> 36:12.520
Are you alright?

36:16.320 --> 36:17.680
It's peaceful out here.

36:31.880 --> 36:35.920
With everything that's gone on...

36:37.840 --> 36:42.080
it's OK if you're not alright,
you know?

36:51.920 --> 36:53.560
I miss them both so much.

36:56.480 --> 36:57.560
Yeah.

36:59.960 --> 37:01.920
Grace was like a little sister.

37:05.920 --> 37:08.440
My mum and dad...

37:08.520 --> 37:10.600
think I killed that man in the barn.

37:11.640 --> 37:13.240
That I went in there, and I...

37:15.760 --> 37:17.520
How could they think that?

37:17.600 --> 37:19.520
About their own son?

37:21.760 --> 37:23.440
Why?

37:23.520 --> 37:25.440
Why would they think it was you?

37:27.760 --> 37:29.120
I went into the barn.

37:30.640 --> 37:32.520
Because I wanted to see him,

37:32.600 --> 37:34.240
to see what he looked like.

37:36.560 --> 37:38.640
But that's all. I didn't...

37:40.400 --> 37:42.320
[sobs]

37:44.160 --> 37:45.640
Jamie...

38:01.720 --> 38:04.840
-Oh, Jamie...
-I didn't mean to.

38:06.200 --> 38:07.520
Oh, shit!

38:08.040 --> 38:10.480
You're upset. It's fine.

38:10.560 --> 38:11.640
I...

38:12.560 --> 38:14.040
I should get back.

38:35.200 --> 38:36.920
[door slams]

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
[Claire] The storm tore up
the old McIntyre farm.

38:39.080 --> 38:41.720
Place is a mess.
More of a mess than usual.

38:43.720 --> 38:45.640
Wait, you're leaving.

38:45.720 --> 38:47.560
Our cab's on its way.

38:47.640 --> 38:50.880
-You can't just go.
-[Rob] What, like you did?

38:50.960 --> 38:54.680
-I had to work.
-You didn't have to. You chose to.

38:54.760 --> 38:57.080
At least be honest about it.

38:59.480 --> 39:00.720
What's going on?

39:02.880 --> 39:04.240
We had to get rid of them.

39:05.920 --> 39:07.560
The car and the body.

39:11.520 --> 39:13.560
Where?

39:13.640 --> 39:17.360
We buried them.
Just beyond the fence.

39:17.440 --> 39:19.320
It was the only way.

39:20.680 --> 39:23.360
[Claire] Don't pretend like you
didn't have a choice.

39:24.560 --> 39:28.120
And don't you pretend that
you're not a part of this.

39:28.200 --> 39:31.680
You could have said something
to the police. You chose not to.

39:31.760 --> 39:34.000
A lie of omission is still a lie.

39:34.080 --> 39:37.520
[Rob] He did it. And he paid for it.

39:37.600 --> 39:38.880
[Claire] An eye for an eye.

39:38.960 --> 39:41.960
Well, maybe that's the way
that it should be!

39:42.040 --> 39:45.880
Cos the system as it is right now
doesn't work, does it? Eh?

39:45.960 --> 39:49.080
I mean, why else is the man
who raped my girlfriend

39:49.160 --> 39:51.360
-still walking the streets?
-[Anna groans]

39:51.440 --> 39:52.840
Answer me that question.

39:52.920 --> 39:54.960
-How does that work?
-[Louise] Please, Rob!

39:55.040 --> 39:57.720
I've already lost my son,
you've already lost your brother.

39:57.800 --> 40:00.280
I don't want to see anyone
going to prison.

40:00.360 --> 40:02.360
Not us, not the Douglases...

40:02.440 --> 40:04.560
-No one.
-[phone rings]

40:06.200 --> 40:07.920
-Must be our cab.
-We'd better get going.

40:08.000 --> 40:11.360
Leave, then.
That's your move, isn't it?

40:11.440 --> 40:14.320
Stick around for the fire and then
leave me to sift through the ashes.

40:14.400 --> 40:16.400
-Hello?
-Just like with Dad.

40:16.480 --> 40:18.080
Yeah, yeah, we'll be out in a sec. OK.

40:22.600 --> 40:24.000
[Rob] See you soon.

40:25.760 --> 40:27.200
[Louise] Love you.

40:33.720 --> 40:35.440
[door slams]

40:47.200 --> 40:50.920
You've been really quiet. Are you OK?

40:52.120 --> 40:53.720
[Anna] I don't want to talk about it.

41:09.720 --> 41:11.920
[distant thunder]

41:29.920 --> 41:33.400
[Juliet] We need to get someone from
the Met round to Peter Elliot's in London.

41:33.480 --> 41:35.240
I couldn't get through.

41:35.320 --> 41:37.800
The phone records have come
through from the hotel

41:37.880 --> 41:39.960
where Adam and Grace
were staying in Spain.

41:40.040 --> 41:44.360
A number of outgoing calls were made
to Adam's dad from the hotel phone.

41:44.440 --> 41:45.840
It's weird, isn't it?

41:45.920 --> 41:48.200
I mean, given Claire Elliot
clearly intimated

41:48.280 --> 41:50.680
that none of them
spoke to their father anymore.

41:50.760 --> 41:52.760
Trying to understand
other people's families

41:52.840 --> 41:56.000
is like trying to get your head around
what's going on in the Middle East.

41:56.080 --> 41:58.880
Confusing, and they'll end up
killing each other anyway,

41:58.960 --> 42:00.600
so what's the point?

42:06.040 --> 42:09.000
We'll send some officers round there
first thing in the morning.

42:09.080 --> 42:12.560
But right now, you should
go home and get some rest.

42:12.640 --> 42:14.320
Be with your daughter.

42:21.360 --> 42:24.480
[answerphone]
<i>You have two saved messages.</i>

42:24.560 --> 42:26.280
<i>First saved message.</i>

42:26.360 --> 42:29.280
<i>Dad, it's me, Adam.</i>

42:29.360 --> 42:31.800
<i>I'm sorry for shouting earlier.</i>
<i>It's just...</i>

42:33.320 --> 42:35.360
<i>I'm scared.</i>

42:35.440 --> 42:37.360
<i>I can't...</i>

42:37.440 --> 42:42.720
<i>Please, Dad,</i>
<i>I need to talk to you about this.</i>

42:42.800 --> 42:43.880
[beep]

43:11.920 --> 43:13.360
[engine starts]

43:19.800 --> 43:22.080
[indistinct voices on TV]

43:26.280 --> 43:28.320
[Claire] The wedding video.

43:30.480 --> 43:35.840
It's one of the tapes...
from when Rob had it edited.

43:38.640 --> 43:40.440
I asked him if I could keep them.

43:45.120 --> 43:47.320
Doesn't he look handsome?

43:52.920 --> 43:54.800
Turn it off.

43:54.880 --> 43:56.800
You shouldn't torture yourself, Mum.

45:10.520 --> 45:11.880
[thunder]

48:27.840 --> 48:28.960
Morning.

48:30.840 --> 48:32.080
Bill.

48:33.200 --> 48:35.400
[Bill] Set to be a good one.

48:35.480 --> 48:37.000
Aye.

48:37.080 --> 48:39.360
Well, they often start out
that way, pal.

48:39.440 --> 48:41.600
[Bill] True, that's true.

48:44.960 --> 48:47.800
-Good to see you.
-Aye.

48:47.880 --> 48:50.000
What are you doing here, Alastair?

48:51.400 --> 48:52.880
Sal not give you my message?

48:52.960 --> 48:54.600
She did, aye.

48:54.680 --> 48:59.400
But the thing is, I can't afford
to not come in for work, Bill.

48:59.480 --> 49:04.040
It's paid leave, Alastair.
I didn't expect...

49:04.120 --> 49:07.160
You know that I've been struggling,
Bill. Me and Sal...

49:08.320 --> 49:09.520
we're short of money.

49:10.560 --> 49:13.240
Ever since that damn roof
started leaking.

49:15.720 --> 49:18.400
You know, the farm's
doing alright, it's...

49:18.480 --> 49:21.280
You know, and I just thought
you could...

49:21.360 --> 49:24.400
You'd find it in yourself
to helping us out.

49:26.360 --> 49:30.440
Oh, I see. You want money.

49:33.880 --> 49:35.640
[sighs]

49:37.400 --> 49:40.320
I've been loyal all these years, Bill.

49:40.400 --> 49:42.440
You know, and I was just hoping...

49:42.520 --> 49:46.200
And by your loyalty,
you mean you'll keep your silence.

49:46.280 --> 49:49.560
About what you saw. About Jamie.

49:51.400 --> 49:54.440
-I'm just saying...
-I know exactly what you're saying.

49:56.560 --> 49:58.040
You'll get your money.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.520
How long have they been at it?

50:14.600 --> 50:16.160
It's round two.

50:16.240 --> 50:18.520
Already a minute and a half longer
than the last round.

50:18.600 --> 50:22.480
Although the first round did last
about five seconds, so...

50:22.560 --> 50:25.240
Come on then, Scarface.
Let's have a look.

50:25.320 --> 50:27.320
[distant moaning]

50:29.520 --> 50:32.040
We're dropping it this afternoon, right?
When the rest arrive?

50:32.120 --> 50:36.520
We're taking it as soon as those two in
there stop scaring the bloody deer away.

50:36.600 --> 50:38.120
Mate, I thought you got 14.

50:38.200 --> 50:39.800
Yeah, I did.

50:45.680 --> 50:46.800
Shit.

51:11.880 --> 51:14.400
[Craig]<i> Come on down.</i>
<i>I swear you'll have an amazing time.</i>

51:14.480 --> 51:17.040
Come on. You didn't think
I would leave you yourself.

51:17.120 --> 51:19.800
<i>Come on. I'll catch you.</i>

51:19.880 --> 51:22.800
Come on down! Join us.

51:22.880 --> 51:24.360
It's amazing down here, Jenny.

51:24.440 --> 51:26.440
I'll catch you. Come on.

51:26.520 --> 51:28.600
<i>Come on. Just jump.</i>

51:29.440 --> 51:31.640
[laughs] It's amazing down here!

51:31.720 --> 51:33.400
<i>Please, come on.</i>

51:34.320 --> 51:36.080
<i>Come down, join the fun, join the party.</i>

51:36.160 --> 51:38.280
<i>Come on.</i>

51:38.360 --> 51:39.920
<i>Jump.</i>

52:05.040 --> 52:06.760
[Maddy] Why India?

52:06.840 --> 52:09.720
Well, there are only two surgeons
in the world who have ever done

52:09.800 --> 52:11.800
an operation like the one you need.

52:11.880 --> 52:14.920
There's a man in America
and a man in India and...

52:15.000 --> 52:17.800
Well, we can't afford to do
the procedure in America.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.880
Have you ever been there?

52:20.960 --> 52:24.240
To India? No.

52:24.320 --> 52:26.400
Hadn't even thought of that.

52:26.480 --> 52:29.120
Elsa, do you know my cousin Elsa?

52:29.200 --> 52:31.760
Well, anyway, she went.

52:31.840 --> 52:36.160
She said it was full of the friendliest
people you'll ever meet.

52:36.240 --> 52:39.720
Everywhere you go people smile.
Proper smiles.

52:40.880 --> 52:44.280
-Not like here.
-People smile here.

52:46.560 --> 52:48.840
Yeah, people smile here.

52:50.560 --> 52:52.040
[knocking at door]

52:52.120 --> 52:53.880
Hey.

52:53.960 --> 52:55.640
Hey, Yuki.

52:56.960 --> 52:58.800
I got this for you on the way over.

52:58.880 --> 53:00.520
What would I do without you?

53:14.640 --> 53:16.200
[Yuki] Everything alright?

53:16.280 --> 53:19.840
Yeah, yeah. Sorry.

53:19.920 --> 53:21.760
I should probably get into work.

53:23.360 --> 53:24.560
See you later.

53:27.480 --> 53:30.320
I'll leave your money on the side.
See you tonight.

53:35.480 --> 53:39.120
[Andrew] Still no word from the Met
on getting through to Peter Elliot.

53:39.200 --> 53:41.520
They've sent a uniform round but...

53:41.600 --> 53:44.000
I had a meeting with the DCI
yesterday. He's pissed off.

53:44.080 --> 53:48.000
All the resources we've gone through,
the media on our backs and no Walsh.

53:48.080 --> 53:51.080
We're doing OK.
We know it's Walsh and we know why.

53:51.160 --> 53:54.000
But that's it. What if this isn't just
some paranoid schizophrenic

53:54.080 --> 53:55.360
off his medication?

53:55.440 --> 53:57.960
What if we're looking at this
from the wrong angle?

53:58.040 --> 54:00.120
What if we should be looking
at these two families?

54:00.200 --> 54:03.760
First there's the calls to his dad
from Adam, then I saw this.

54:06.880 --> 54:08.560
-What?
-I called the paper when I saw this

54:08.640 --> 54:11.200
-and asked them when it was taken.
-How come?

54:11.280 --> 54:13.040
They said it was taken the morning after

54:13.120 --> 54:15.560
the Douglas and Elliot families found out
about their kids.

54:15.640 --> 54:18.360
-That day we went to talk to the families.
-So?

54:18.440 --> 54:21.400
Louise Elliot said they were there
all morning, watching TV.

54:21.480 --> 54:25.560
To be fair, they weren't exactly
in their right minds, were they?

54:27.080 --> 54:29.360
I don't get it.
How come you called the paper?

54:29.440 --> 54:31.960
Do you notice anything odd about it?

54:32.480 --> 54:35.960
These people live in the country
and it's the day after a heavy storm.

54:37.400 --> 54:38.720
I'm not following.

54:38.800 --> 54:41.520
When you live in a place like that,
things become second nature,

54:41.600 --> 54:42.960
like brushing your teeth.

54:43.040 --> 54:45.200
There are certain things
you just do, you know?

54:45.280 --> 54:48.000
So if it's the day after a storm
these fields are going to be

54:48.080 --> 54:49.720
a raindrop away from a mud-slide.

54:49.800 --> 54:52.360
So why the hell would anyone
who's lived there for that long

54:52.440 --> 54:55.200
head out into the field wearing
a pair of slippers?

55:10.720 --> 55:12.840
Meredith?

55:14.280 --> 55:16.320
Have you ever done something wrong?

55:18.200 --> 55:21.000
Something that you really regret?

55:22.520 --> 55:24.560
[Meredith] Now, why would you
ask me such a thing?

55:27.440 --> 55:29.400
I'm just...

55:29.480 --> 55:30.760
I'm rambling.

55:30.840 --> 55:32.600
Ignore me.

56:15.920 --> 56:17.160
Mum.

56:22.680 --> 56:24.000
I'm a wreck, Mum.

56:26.120 --> 56:28.040
I can't stop thinking about it.

56:29.960 --> 56:34.080
And as much as I try and convince
myself that it was for the best

56:34.160 --> 56:35.840
and that he...

56:37.160 --> 56:39.400
deserved to die, I just...

56:41.120 --> 56:42.440
I feel sick.

56:44.760 --> 56:46.640
I can't do it.

56:46.720 --> 56:48.600
I can't keep it a secret.

56:49.640 --> 56:53.240
And Adam, of all people,

56:53.320 --> 56:55.800
he wouldn't have wanted us to.

56:56.680 --> 56:59.440
I'm gonna tell the police
what happened.

57:03.520 --> 57:07.680
I found something last night
in the fireplace.

57:08.960 --> 57:11.160
In Rob's room.

58:16.680 --> 58:18.560
Robert Elliot?

58:27.520 --> 58:29.240
We need to talk to you.
