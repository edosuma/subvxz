00:16.520 --> 00:17.396
Thank you, sir

00:19.560 --> 00:23.189
I wish you had stayed on
to take your degree

00:23.480 --> 00:25.994
I couldn't afford to

00:26.320 --> 00:28.834
But don't give up your writing

00:29.120 --> 00:32.999
I remember your stories in the
college magazine about village life

00:34.640 --> 00:38.315
They were very good. You know,
one can earn a living by writing

00:58.800 --> 01:04.193

05:28.880 --> 05:31.269
Good morning. Sit down

05:33.880 --> 05:36.394
What use will that be?

05:36.640 --> 05:40.189
It will rest your legs

05:42.320 --> 05:46.199
I haven't come up to rest my legs

05:46.480 --> 05:51.554
You know very well why I'm here

05:52.080 --> 05:55.277
I'm going to ask a straight question,

05:55.560 --> 05:58.597
and I'd like a straight answer

06:00.720 --> 06:04.190
- What is the date?
- The tenth

06:05.040 --> 06:08.919
- How many months rent do you owe me?
- Three

06:09.240 --> 06:11.515
That makes twenty-one rupees

06:11.800 --> 06:15.315
Will you pay me now,
or shall I return this evening?

06:15.600 --> 06:19.275
That makes three questions, not one

06:19.640 --> 06:21.232
It's not fair

06:23.560 --> 06:26.518
Many things are not fair

06:26.800 --> 06:32.033
Is it fair
that I should house you for nothing?

06:33.560 --> 06:38.429
That you should use electricity
all day without paying for it?

06:39.240 --> 06:41.754
You have had education.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.310
You have pictures
of great men on the wall

06:45.600 --> 06:48.956
Is it fair
that you don't pay the rent?

06:49.240 --> 06:52.437
It's a sign of greatness, you know

06:54.640 --> 06:59.111
I, too, could turn a pretty phrase...

07:01.080 --> 07:03.878
...but it would not be fit

07:04.160 --> 07:07.675
for your young ears

07:07.960 --> 07:13.114
Anyway, either I get my money
this evening...

07:13.400 --> 07:17.598
...or I'll look for a new lodger

08:49.400 --> 08:51.470
This letter is for you, not me

08:51.760 --> 08:53.478
We're both Rays

08:59.640 --> 09:04.509
We are pleased to accept your short
story "A Man of the Soil"...

09:04.800 --> 09:08.395
...for publication in the next
<i>ssue of Sahityik</i>

09:12.800 --> 09:14.074
Not bad news, I hope

09:17.400 --> 09:21.109
Why do you get so few letters?

09:21.400 --> 09:23.789
Does nobody write to you?

09:24.080 --> 09:27.231
I'd like to open a love letter
by mistake

09:30.200 --> 09:32.794
Perhaps it's as well

09:33.080 --> 09:37.551
I've experienced
matrimonial complications

09:56.080 --> 09:58.958
HARIMATI PRIMARY SCHOOL

10:24.400 --> 10:27.949
You advertised for a teacher

10:29.000 --> 10:30.069
Qualifications?

10:31.040 --> 10:34.953
- Intermediate Science
- No good, we want Matriculation

10:36.720 --> 10:39.234
But I got that before Intermediate

10:39.520 --> 10:40.794
What did the advertisement say?

10:41.240 --> 10:43.754
It did specify Matriculation

10:44.240 --> 10:48.950
Then why harp on Intermediate?
What's the point?

10:49.240 --> 10:52.596
Would you work
for ten rupees a month?

11:11.680 --> 11:12.590
Well?

11:12.880 --> 11:15.713
I understand
you want someone in your factory.

11:16.520 --> 11:19.478
I have Matriculation

11:28.560 --> 11:30.630
Any experience of labelling?

11:30.920 --> 11:35.038
Labelling?
No, but I can learn

11:49.960 --> 11:54.556
Go through that door
and down the passage.

11:54.840 --> 11:58.071
Take a look first

16:24.800 --> 16:26.153
Pulu!

16:29.000 --> 16:30.228
You're a fine friend.

16:30.520 --> 16:35.594
Why didn't you tell me
you'd left the student hostel?

16:37.280 --> 16:42.798
I've been searching north Calcutta
for you since four o'clock

16:43.280 --> 16:47.796
I finally got your address from the
people you give private lessons to

16:49.280 --> 16:51.157
What's so funny?

16:51.520 --> 16:53.158
You've put on weight

16:53.440 --> 16:55.317
I had.
I lost it these last three hours

16:55.600 --> 17:01.152
Would you like tea at the cafe
around the corner?

17:01.440 --> 17:03.158
All right.

17:03.760 --> 17:06.273
But I've two tickets for
us to see Sadhabar Ekadashi

17:10.839 --> 17:16.153
Is this a hideout? Are you
forging banknotes or something?

17:16.680 --> 17:18.397
I wish I could

17:18.680 --> 17:21.194
And you cook for yourself?

17:21.440 --> 17:25.148
I'll cook you a meal one day:
Rice and potatoes

17:39.200 --> 17:41.430
What about the railway job?

17:42.400 --> 17:44.709
I thought you'd got it

17:47.240 --> 17:51.233
There was a strike on, and they
wanted people as strike-breakers

17:55.640 --> 17:58.029
So you've been unemployed?

17:58.880 --> 18:00.836
I give some private lessons

18:01.160 --> 18:04.072
- How much do you make?
- Fifteen rupees a month

18:09.960 --> 18:11.234
Didn't you learn to type?

18:11.640 --> 18:13.358
Yes, I thought it might be useful

18:13.640 --> 18:17.189
Good. I'll get you a job
as soon as we return

18:17.480 --> 18:19.835
Where are we going?

18:21.200 --> 18:26.832
You'll come with me to my cousin
Aparna's wedding on Monday

18:27.160 --> 18:29.116
- Where?
- Just for a few days

18:29.480 --> 18:31.789
- But where?
- Khulna.

18:32.080 --> 18:34.275
Khulna!
It's a hundred miles away

18:34.960 --> 18:37.474
You'll love it there

18:37.720 --> 18:41.793
An old-world village,
a lovely river with boats on it

18:42.080 --> 18:45.117
Fields of grass and paddy.

18:45.400 --> 18:48.198
Bamboo groves, mango orchards

18:49.320 --> 18:52.039
Doesn't it tempt you?

18:53.200 --> 18:57.830
Trees full of birds:
Magpies, thrushes, nightingales

18:58.160 --> 19:03.029
And in the evening,
fireflies and oil lamps aglow

19:03.320 --> 19:04.673
No electricity

19:04.960 --> 19:08.032
Doesn't it sound tempting?

19:09.880 --> 19:13.031
You'll come, won't you?

19:14.680 --> 19:18.070
Take me back to thy lap,
O Mother Earth

19:18.360 --> 19:22.751
Take back thy son and wrap him
<i>n thine ample robe</i>

19:23.600 --> 19:28.833
Let me be one with the soil,
and spread myself

19:29.120 --> 19:31.634
Far and wide,
like the joys of spring,

19:31.920 --> 19:34.593
let me burst the heart's narrow cage

19:34.880 --> 19:39.829
reak down the stonewalls of self
and the cheerless prison of the mind

19:40.120 --> 19:42.998
To rush forth in a rapture of delight

19:43.280 --> 19:46.636
And flow to the far ends of the earth,

19:46.920 --> 19:49.753
surging, billowing, rolling on

19:50.680 --> 19:51.908
A policeman

19:52.200 --> 19:53.519
Who's there?

19:53.800 --> 19:56.837
<i>Am Mainaak,</i>
son of the Himalayas,

19:57.120 --> 19:59.759
hiding my wings in the sea

20:00.760 --> 20:02.318
What's come over you?

20:02.600 --> 20:05.433
You sound
as if you've had too much to drink

20:10.040 --> 20:13.350
I don't think I'll take that job

20:13.640 --> 20:15.073
Don't be absurd

20:17.160 --> 20:21.631
Why should I become a clerk?
There is no reason why I should

20:21.920 --> 20:26.357
I'm a free man, without ties,
no one to worry about

20:26.640 --> 20:29.200
Why should I become a clerk?

20:29.480 --> 20:32.199
But you can't keep pawning books
to pay the rent

20:32.480 --> 20:35.438
- Things will change
- Not without a job

20:35.960 --> 20:38.679
Listen, those with real talent...

20:38.960 --> 20:41.190
Needn't eat?

20:49.480 --> 20:51.198
Apurba Kumar Ray

20:51.480 --> 20:53.869
Make fun of me, but just wait and see

20:54.960 --> 20:58.191
Something up your sleeve?
Some new poems?

20:58.480 --> 21:00.198
You're too prosaic

21:01.480 --> 21:05.029
You'll go abroad,
become an engineer,

21:05.320 --> 21:10.553
get a fat job and settle down

21:11.160 --> 21:16.029
So I'm prosaic? That's gratitude!

21:17.880 --> 21:23.034
Who took you in hand in Calcutta?
Country bumpkin scared of the traffic

21:25.040 --> 21:30.034
Who read your first short story,
and what did he say about it?

21:33.880 --> 21:36.030
Don't get so worked up

21:36.320 --> 21:40.757
Do you know why I feel so elated?

21:41.480 --> 21:45.029
I've had my first good meal
for months, thanks to you

21:46.480 --> 21:49.358
Well, are you writing anything?

21:52.080 --> 21:55.595
A wonderful novel

21:55.880 --> 21:58.713
Why didn't you tell me?

21:59.560 --> 22:02.358
- Do you know a good publisher?
- No problem

22:07.480 --> 22:10.040
A boy

22:12.840 --> 22:17.152
A village boy.
Poor, but sensitive

22:18.360 --> 22:21.033
Father, a priest. He dies

22:22.480 --> 22:27.679
The boy doesn't want to be a priest.
He wants to study, he's ambitious

22:30.320 --> 22:31.753
He studies

22:32.960 --> 22:37.078
In the process, I see him struggle

22:37.360 --> 22:41.990
He sheds superstition and prejudice

22:42.280 --> 22:44.794
He takes nothing on trust

22:45.080 --> 22:47.036
He tries to be rational

22:47.320 --> 22:53.429
He has imagination,
he's intrigued by little things

22:53.720 --> 22:59.431
He has greatness in him, perhaps.
He has the ability to create

22:59.720 --> 23:01.358
But he doesn't

23:01.640 --> 23:04.359
Right, but that's not a tragedy

23:04.640 --> 23:08.315
He remains poor, in want

23:08.600 --> 23:13.674
But he doesn't turn from life,
he doesn't want to escape

23:13.960 --> 23:19.034
He is fulfilled, he wants to live

23:20.640 --> 23:22.676
This is autobiography

23:22.960 --> 23:29.035
Partly, but there are imaginary
characters, plot, love...

23:29.880 --> 23:34.431
Love?
What do you know of love?

23:34.720 --> 23:37.473
You've never been
within ten paces of a girl

23:37.760 --> 23:40.479
It's not that easy,
you have no experience

23:40.760 --> 23:46.039
- Is imagination worth nothing?
- Not where love is concerned

23:49.320 --> 23:52.551
- You're quite wrong
- I'm absolutely right

24:52.840 --> 24:56.196
How much further wilt thou lead me,
O Fair One?

24:56.480 --> 24:59.711
Tell me what shore thy golden boat
will touch

25:00.000 --> 25:02.639
Whatever I ask thee, O thou
from distant lands

25:02.920 --> 25:05.957
Thou smilest in thine own sweet way

25:06.240 --> 25:09.437
And I can never know
what is in thy mind

25:10.080 --> 25:15.234
Silently, thou liftest a finger
pointing to the trackless, wild sea

25:15.520 --> 25:19.115
As, far to the west,
the sun goes down in the sky

25:19.520 --> 25:23.798
What lies there?
What do we go to seek?

25:24.080 --> 25:27.629
Tell me, I pray thee,
O stranger fair

25:27.920 --> 25:31.117
Where, at the edge of evening,
glows the day...

25:37.680 --> 25:39.318
Give me your hand

25:45.400 --> 25:48.119
Wonderful. Really wonderful

26:02.840 --> 26:04.751
Look who is here!

26:05.040 --> 26:08.396
It's Pulu, and not alone

26:08.680 --> 26:14.391
I hope the journey was not
too unpleasant for city people

26:15.000 --> 26:18.117
My youngest son, Murari.

26:18.400 --> 26:21.233
He's studying at Daulatpur College

26:21.520 --> 26:24.398
Take his luggage

26:36.520 --> 26:38.397
My aunt

26:40.320 --> 26:44.711
It's a pity you didn't think of him
as a possible son-in-law

26:45.000 --> 26:47.389
Where have I seen him before?

26:47.680 --> 26:50.035
Impossible. He's never been here

26:50.320 --> 26:53.392
But I know his face so well

26:54.240 --> 26:59.189
Yes, I saw a picture of Lord Krishna
looking just like him

26:59.520 --> 27:01.238
Lord Krishna...

27:01.520 --> 27:03.715
...complete with his flute

29:29.520 --> 29:32.830
Binu, my son, come out now

29:44.360 --> 29:47.830
What's wrong? Isn't he well?

29:48.960 --> 29:51.997
It's nothing. The sun was so hot

29:55.520 --> 30:00.833
The long journey and the fasting
must have upset him

30:04.600 --> 30:07.831
Bring water, and a fan

30:34.280 --> 30:35.713
This is a fine wedding

30:38.000 --> 30:40.719
That boy is insane

30:41.000 --> 30:44.675
Who says so? He is perfectly sane.

30:44.960 --> 30:46.518
The journey and the heat...

30:46.800 --> 30:49.951
If you don't stop the wedding, I will

30:50.480 --> 30:52.994
But the auspicious hour is passing

30:53.280 --> 30:55.669
Leave this room!

30:55.960 --> 30:57.916
It's you who is mad

31:04.440 --> 31:09.150
When the hour has passed,
my daughter will never marry

31:18.280 --> 31:21.795
Isn't there another auspicious hour,
at ten?

31:22.080 --> 31:27.154
Don't ask me. This means ruin for me

31:47.280 --> 31:48.952
Have I missed the ceremony?

31:49.280 --> 31:52.795
There's no wedding

31:55.520 --> 31:58.159
The bridegroom is mad

32:03.600 --> 32:06.398
Apu, everything depends on you now

32:08.160 --> 32:11.755
Are you joking?

32:16.280 --> 32:18.032
What is all this?

32:20.240 --> 32:23.835
If the wedding does not take place
at the auspicious times...

32:24.120 --> 32:26.509
...the bride is cursed

32:26.800 --> 32:28.233
But what can I do?

32:28.520 --> 32:34.755
We have to find another husband for
her and you are the obvious choice

32:41.840 --> 32:45.150
You want me
to be a substitute bridegroom?

32:46.920 --> 32:51.436
Is this a play or a novel?
What do you take me for?

32:52.280 --> 32:57.832
Are you still living
in the Dark Ages?

33:01.280 --> 33:04.113
Calm down and listen to me

33:04.400 --> 33:06.789
No, I won't listen
to a pack of lunatics

33:07.080 --> 33:09.150
Everything depends on you

33:09.440 --> 33:12.159
It's no use, let's go

34:41.239 --> 34:44.152
Come here a moment

35:00.480 --> 35:03.358
Can you really get me that job?

35:07.280 --> 35:12.957
You'll have to lend me a shirt,
and I must have a shave

36:00.000 --> 36:02.275
Your daughter
didn't worship Shiva in vain.

36:02.560 --> 36:05.313
A curse became a blessing

36:05.600 --> 36:07.352
The moment I saw him,

36:07.640 --> 36:12.475
I knew he was nearer to me
than my own kin

36:12.760 --> 36:19.074
Pulu has brought many
of his friends here...

36:19.360 --> 36:23.399
...but I've never felt so drawn
to anyone

37:33.120 --> 37:36.317
There are a few things
that I must tell you

37:40.440 --> 37:43.159
I've had no opportunity before

37:47.280 --> 37:50.477
How much do you know about me?

37:54.000 --> 37:56.150
Has Pulu told you anything?

37:56.440 --> 37:58.032
Yes

37:59.000 --> 38:01.150
What did he say?

38:03.680 --> 38:04.999
You're an orphan

38:07.240 --> 38:09.117
Yes.

38:10.720 --> 38:12.950
I lost my father when I was ten

38:14.280 --> 38:16.794
Mother died seven years later

38:18.440 --> 38:21.876
I had a sister, too

38:29.600 --> 38:32.160
What else did he tell you?

38:32.440 --> 38:34.556
You write well

38:34.840 --> 38:38.150
He told you that, did he?

38:38.920 --> 38:42.151
Can you read?

38:42.600 --> 38:44.955
Yes. Bengali

38:46.440 --> 38:49.398
I'm writing my novel in Bengali

38:49.680 --> 38:51.432
I know

38:52.080 --> 38:55.152
What else did he say?

38:55.440 --> 38:57.317
Nothing else

38:57.920 --> 39:01.799
That's not very much

39:03.680 --> 39:06.194
You know little
of the man you married

39:08.440 --> 39:11.352
I have no means, no job...

39:13.360 --> 39:15.954
...and almost no future

39:16.280 --> 39:21.035
What kind of home
shall I take you to?

39:23.280 --> 39:28.149
You've been brought up
in these surroundings

39:28.600 --> 39:33.151
A spacious house, servants,
fine rooms

39:35.200 --> 39:36.713
This marriage was forced on me.

39:37.000 --> 39:40.151
I was against it, but...

39:43.600 --> 39:48.469
Something changed my mind,
I felt I would be doing a noble thing

39:52.280 --> 39:55.158
Everything became confused

40:00.520 --> 40:02.715
Why don't you say something?

40:03.000 --> 40:06.151
I can't decide
until I know your mind

40:08.440 --> 40:13.958
Aparna, will you be able
to endure poverty?

40:17.440 --> 40:22.150
Can you live with a poor husband?

40:27.960 --> 40:28.836
Yes

40:38.600 --> 40:40.477
Can you really?

40:42.320 --> 40:44.197
Why not?

40:53.600 --> 40:56.319
Then I'll take you with me.

40:56.600 --> 40:59.273
If your father objects,
I'll ignore him

41:00.400 --> 41:03.358
- Will you object?
- I don't know

41:06.680 --> 41:09.319
- I wonder what they'll say
- Who?

41:09.600 --> 41:11.352
My neighbours.

41:11.640 --> 41:15.315
I went to a wedding,
but I shall return with the bride

41:48.360 --> 41:50.794
I'll come back for the luggage

43:20.440 --> 43:21.793
This is my room

43:38.280 --> 43:40.236
Sit down. I won't be long

46:05.640 --> 46:07.835
You must be very sad

46:10.800 --> 46:12.028
Really not?

46:17.160 --> 46:20.118
They want to see us downstairs

46:23.960 --> 46:27.111
Make way. Let's see the bride

46:30.320 --> 46:34.677
What a lovely bride!

48:17.600 --> 48:20.034
Why gawp? Am I new?

48:32.960 --> 48:35.713
Only after meals. You promised

51:20.520 --> 51:21.953
Do you lament your decision?

51:23.000 --> 51:26.959
What?
I don't know such difficult words

51:27.800 --> 51:28.789
Will "regret" do?

51:30.320 --> 51:31.309
Yes

51:31.600 --> 51:34.114
- Do you regret it?
- Regret what?

51:34.400 --> 51:36.311
- Do I have to explain that too?
- Yes

51:37.880 --> 51:39.791
You missed out on a rich husband

51:41.840 --> 51:44.638
- You're laughing!
- No, I'm crying

51:56.440 --> 51:58.829
You must feel sorry

51:59.240 --> 52:02.835
Of course.
I could have had an easy life

52:12.800 --> 52:14.950
- I'm going.
- Where?

52:15.240 --> 52:17.117
To look for a maid servant

52:18.880 --> 52:22.111
Don't be silly. Come back, please

52:47.840 --> 52:50.115
Who will pay for the servant?

52:50.400 --> 52:53.119
I'll get more private lessons

52:58.800 --> 53:01.439
Then send me back to my parents

53:05.120 --> 53:10.797
One lesson is bad enough
after a hard day's work

53:11.080 --> 53:13.116
What should I do, then?

53:16.240 --> 53:21.439
I'll tell you:
Give up the lesson you have

53:22.960 --> 53:24.279
And then what?

53:25.520 --> 53:30.275
Then my poor husband
will come home early

53:34.640 --> 53:36.870
Then I shall lament no more

56:20.560 --> 56:24.030
God of Fire!
Destroy his meditation!

56:45.640 --> 56:50.270
Are you cross with me?

56:51.080 --> 56:55.631
Yes. Why do we always take a cab?

56:56.840 --> 56:59.957
Buses are crowded. We're alone here

57:00.400 --> 57:02.516
But it costs much more

57:02.840 --> 57:04.273
Does it matter?

57:06.680 --> 57:10.912
Soon you're going to your parents,
my expenses will be halved

57:13.040 --> 57:14.314
Only for two months

57:15.560 --> 57:16.754
Isn't that a long time?

57:19.400 --> 57:22.710
What about the extra expenses
when we come back?

57:28.040 --> 57:29.712
Ah, yes...

57:35.360 --> 57:39.911
I wouldn't have let you go,
but your mother was so insistent

57:40.200 --> 57:43.590
And I felt you'd rather be with her

57:43.880 --> 57:44.835
at such a time

57:45.120 --> 57:48.669
A relief for you, too.
No one to bother you for two months

57:51.720 --> 57:54.280
One job will be done

57:54.560 --> 57:59.395
I'll have time to work on my novel.
I haven't touched it since we married

57:59.960 --> 58:01.188
Is that my fault?

58:05.720 --> 58:09.998
No, it's your virtue. You know how
much my novel means to me, don't you?

58:10.840 --> 58:13.195
- Well, you mean much more
- Really?

58:15.720 --> 58:17.278
I shall dedicate it to you

58:17.800 --> 58:18.789
You'll what?

58:21.520 --> 58:22.714
I know what "wife" means

58:28.360 --> 58:31.511
You don't. I do

58:31.800 --> 58:33.677
I do, too

58:43.360 --> 58:46.397
- What?
- The matches

59:08.280 --> 59:11.158
What is there in your eyes?

59:14.440 --> 59:15.998
Kohl

59:28.880 --> 59:30.836
We'll expect you in the holidays

59:31.120 --> 59:34.829
I'll do my best. Send a telegram
when you arrive; letters take so long

59:56.600 --> 59:59.910
- Promise you'll come
- Haven't I given my word?

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:01.997
You must write twice a week

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:04.840
- You must write, too
- Not unless you do

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:07.998
Write to my office address,
or Mr. Ray will open your letters

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:10.795
I had so many things to tell you

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:14.470
Yes, I asked Pintu's mother
to make you some cakes

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:17.678
There's a bill to pay at the grocer's

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:21.077
I've left some jewellery behind

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:23.794
Please take care of yourself

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:43.029
You'll see her in a week,
so cheer up

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:53.594
I wish I knew your secret

01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:59.710
How to be married and happy
on forty-five rupees a month

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.719
How do you know I'm happy?

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.718
I can guess

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:25.389
I don't know what your wife is like,
but mine...

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:30.399
I like them to be a little pert...

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:35.390
...a little saucy, a little naughty

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:41.599
It adds spice to a marriage,

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:43.438
don't you think?

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:47.878
My wife is just the opposite

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:53.792
Never quarrels, never complains,
never answers back...

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:56.992
...always meek and obedient

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:01.709
Utterly bland, tasteless

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:09.638
Plus this

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:22.955
You've promised to come on the 8th

01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:28.951
<i>f you don't, I'll never speak</i>
to you again, never, ever

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:33.711
You should have sent me
eight letters last month...

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.472
...and I only got seven

01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:43.389
<i>should never trust you</i>

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.437
And I feel jealous of that girl
next door

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:27.238
She sees you morning and evening,
and I don't

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:29.795
Do keep the window shut

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:17.037
What else is there to tell?

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:22.030
The more I write, the more
you will laugh at my mistakes

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:27.110
ut I don't care.
You are the writer, not me

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.719
Please take good care of yourself

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.391
<i>am well, but my heart is sick.</i>
<i>T will heal when you come</i>

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:40.117
<i>f you don't, I'll never speak</i>
to you again, never, ever

01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:56.590
What is it?

01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:00.832
Aparna...

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:08.076
In childbirth...

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:49.872
She said: "I'm leaving him
in your care, Mrs. Ganguly

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:53.868
"He's so absent-minded,
he forgets to eat sometimes"

01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:00.872
Such sweet words
and such gentle ways

01:09:02.399 --> 01:09:06.188
Well, it's a good thing
the baby was saved.

01:09:06.479 --> 01:09:08.835
Fate works in strange ways

01:09:09.359 --> 01:09:15.707
But a young fellow like you
shouldn't give up

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:21.916
"While Krishna has
his knot of hair and flute

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:24.714
there'll be women to serve him"

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.993
Why, you could marry ten times over
if you wanted

01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:22.670
Dear Pulu. You must have heard
the news by now

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.470
<i>hear you're going abroad.</i>
<i>Wish you success</i>

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:28.876
<i>'m going away, too</i>

01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:31.469
<i>don't know where I'm going,</i>

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:35.036
ut I do know why:
<i>Want to be free</i>

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:38.198
<i>'m taking my novel with me.</i>

01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:41.199
<i>'Ll send it to you if I finish it</i>

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:44.278
You may publish it
<i>f you like it enough.</i>

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:47.199
Yours, Apu

01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:04.152
What have you thrown in my food?

01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:17.312
I'll teach you a lesson, my lad!

01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:21.510
He's bitten me

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:27.158
Wait and see
what your grandfather will do

01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:31.279
You'll tell grandfather?

01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:35.189
Just wait. You need a good hiding

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:38.031
He'll bash you if you do

01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:42.192
Who will bash me?

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:46.271
My father. He lives in Calcutta

01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:51.670
Father! That's a good one!

01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:58.479
We haven't seen his pigtail
these last five years

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:07.833
Do fathers have pigtails?

01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:18.995
He's not shown up once,
even to see his own son

01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:22.076
He's sent three money orders.

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:26.876
Perhaps he calls that doing his duty

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:29.674
Where is Apu?

01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:32.838
I was dead against the marriage

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:39.150
It was you and your aunt
who took my daughter...

01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:44.514
Do you know where Apu is?
I'd just like to know

01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:50.158
Somewhere in Central India, working
in some coal mine, the vagabond

01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:54.672
And the boy takes after him

01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:59.670
Always running around
and getting up to mischief

01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:03.157
When your aunt was alive
she could manage him,

01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:06.477
but it's too much for me

01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:09.516
Do you know Apu's address?

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:13.679
Whatever is on his letter

01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:16.474
Do you think he'll come back?

01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:21.675
Not that heartless brute

01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:30.438
When did you get back?

01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:34.432
I went to my uncle, looking for you

01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:43.834
- What are you doing here?
- Working

01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:48.556
- Since when?
- About a year

01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:52.114
So far from home?

01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:54.755
I didn't come here for a job

01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:59.512
I arrived here in my wanderings

01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:03.917
I had to fill my stomach

01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:08.079
- Has it been filled now?
- More or less

01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:11.750
How is the novel getting along?

01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:16.550
I threw it away

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:19.350
Why throw it away?

01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:22.473
What's the use?

01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:27.148
Come along

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:34.352
Are you going to stay here?

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:42.472
- I'm thinking of going away
- Where?

01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:47.149
Anywhere. Perhaps abroad.
I'm saving up

01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:50.679
Going alone?

01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:54.635
- Who else is there?
- Kajal

01:24:55.920 --> 01:25:01.631
Your son

01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:09.153
So that's what they called him

01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:29.311
- Go back home
- Why?

01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:35.154
The boy needs someone
to look after him

01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:39.469
There's such a thing
as a father's duty,

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:41.637
or did you throw duty away, too?

01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:46.311
Who says I don't do my duty?
I've sent money

01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:52.630
- Is that all you can do?
- I can't do any more

01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:05.149
Don't you love your son?

01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:11.151
No

01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:19.954
How can I love him?

01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:25.558
I've never seen him,
to me he is unreal, untrue

01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:29.154
For me he doesn't exist

01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:35.957
You must have lost your senses

01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:47.354
Anyway, I've done my duty.
The rest is up to you

01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:59.635
Come here for a moment

01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:03.438
My train leaves at seven

01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:09.390
Come here

01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:23.709
Please do something for the boy,
put him in a home or something

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.310
- Do that yourself
- No, I can't

01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:34.629
- It's not possible for me
- I can't understand why not

01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:39.637
There is something
which I can't forget

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:50.518
Because Kajal exists...

01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:53.518
Aparna does not

01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:00.639
I've sent money
and I'll send more if necessary

01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:11.313
More than that, I cannot do

01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:17.950
I have no love for him.
He is like a stranger

01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:23.312
If you think
he is not being looked after...

01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:28.151
...make some arrangement for him

01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:38.637
Shall I give you money now?

01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:43.755
I've no time. I have to start
a new job on Monday

01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:55.634
Who is it?

01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:04.150
Who do you want?

01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:11.395
I'm Apurba

01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:39.834
Have you come to fetch him?

01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:43.873
I've arranged to leave him
with friends in my home village

01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:47.757
I'm going away

01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:50.429
He's upstairs

01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:55.518
He's been feverish,
but he's better now

01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:54.589
I'm your father

01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:38.028
What are you doing?

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:45.553
You might have killed the boy

01:35:56.920 --> 01:35:59.070
Won't you make friends with me?

01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:03.158
I know lots of good stories

01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:08.150
Ghost stories,
stories about demons...

01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:13.435
...kings, queens, princes
and winged horses

01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:19.279
Want to hear them?

01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:35.514
I'll leave this jewellery with you...

01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:39.315
...in case you want to send him
to boarding school

01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:44.151
It seems to be the only way
to be relieved of his burden

01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:52.152
Can't you take him with you by force?

01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:56.149
As his father
you have the right to do that

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:00.151
No, I couldn't do that

01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:07.149
I knew it. I knew all along
that you could do nothing

01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:20.511
What do you want to say, Kajal?

01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:23.554
Where are you going?

01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:26.034
Will you come with me?

01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:29.353
Are you going to Calcutta?

01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:32.397
If I did, would you come with me?

01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:35.432
Would you take me to my father?

01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:39.676
Certainly

01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:42.838
Will he be cross with me?

01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:46.749
Why should he be?

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.877
He'll never leave me?

01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:55.749
Never

01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:02.236
Who are you?

01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:08.311
I'm your friend

01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:12.591
Will you come with me?

01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:27.079
Grandpa will be angry

01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:32.389
Grandpa won't know, I won't tell him

01:39:33.305 --> 01:39:39.773
