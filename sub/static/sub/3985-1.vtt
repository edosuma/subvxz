00:13.267 --> 00:16.236
Anybody in plumbing,
please go to aisle four.

00:28.013 --> 00:30.414
God damn!

00:32.151 --> 00:34.306
Ah, I see you got
the DeWalt cordless.

00:34.454 --> 00:36.908
Your nail gun--
DeWalt 410.

00:37.056 --> 00:38.309
Yeah. The trouble is,

00:38.457 --> 00:40.477
you leave it
in a truck for a while,

00:40.625 --> 00:42.447
need to step up
and use the bitch,

00:42.595 --> 00:44.349
the battery don't hold up,
you know?

00:44.497 --> 00:46.350
Yeah, cordless'll do that.

00:46.498 --> 00:49.152
You might want to consider
the powder-actuated tool.

00:49.300 --> 00:52.988
The Hilti DX 460 MX
or the Simpson PTP--

00:53.137 --> 00:55.125
these two
are my Cadillacs.

00:55.273 --> 00:58.828
Everything else on this board
is second-best, sorry to say.

00:58.976 --> 01:01.463
Are you contracting, or just doing
some work around the house?

01:01.611 --> 01:04.900
- No, we work all over.
- Full time?

01:05.048 --> 01:07.702
No, we had about
five jobs last month.

01:07.850 --> 01:09.137
Ah. With that rate,

01:09.285 --> 01:12.239
the cost of the powder-actuated guns
justifies itself.

01:12.387 --> 01:14.441
- You say "power"?
- Powder.

01:14.589 --> 01:16.978
- Like gunpowder?
- Yeah.

01:17.125 --> 01:20.681
The DX 460 is fully automatic,
with a.27-caliber charge.

01:20.829 --> 01:23.917
Wood, concrete,
steel to steel--

01:24.064 --> 01:26.986
she'll throw a fastener into anything.
And for my money,

01:27.134 --> 01:30.324
she handles recoil better than
the Simpson or the P3500.

01:30.472 --> 01:32.258
Now, you understand
what I mean by recoil?

01:32.406 --> 01:34.193
Yeah, the kickback.
I'm with you.

01:34.341 --> 01:37.729
- That's right.
-.27 caliber, huh?

01:37.877 --> 01:39.198
Yeah, not large
ballistically,

01:39.346 --> 01:40.565
but for driving nails,
it's enough.

01:40.714 --> 01:43.336
Any more than that,
you'd add to the recoil.

01:43.483 --> 01:47.339
Man, shit. I seen
a tiny-ass.22 round-nose

01:47.487 --> 01:49.774
drop a nigga
plenty of days, man.

01:49.923 --> 01:52.210
Motherfuckers get up
in you like a pinball,

01:52.357 --> 01:53.345
rip your ass up.

01:53.493 --> 01:54.613
Big joints, though--

01:54.760 --> 01:56.881
big joints, man,
just break your bones,

01:57.029 --> 02:00.517
you say, "Fuck it."

02:00.665 --> 02:03.954
I'm gonna go with this right here, man.
How much I owe you?

02:04.101 --> 02:06.399
$669 plus tax.

02:09.940 --> 02:11.628
No no, you just pay
at the register.

02:11.775 --> 02:14.296
Nah, man, you go ahead
and handle that for me, man.

02:14.445 --> 02:16.031
And keep the rest
for your time.

02:16.179 --> 02:18.967
- This is $800.
- So what, man?

02:19.115 --> 02:22.949
You earned that buck
like a motherfucker. Keep that shit.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.821
- We good?
- Yeah, man.

02:40.969 --> 02:42.822
The man said if you
want to shoot nails,

02:42.971 --> 02:45.024
this here is
the Cadillac, man.

02:45.172 --> 02:47.160
He mean Lexus,
but he ain't know it.

02:47.308 --> 02:49.663
- Hold the charge better?
- Man, fuck the charge.

02:49.811 --> 02:53.265
This here is gunpowder-activated,
.27 caliber,

02:53.412 --> 02:56.835
full auto, no kickback,
nail-throwing mayhem, man.

02:56.984 --> 02:58.471
Shit right here is tight.

02:58.619 --> 03:01.005
Fuck just nailing up boards.

03:01.153 --> 03:03.842
We could kill a couple motherfuckers
with this right here.

03:03.990 --> 03:06.444
You laughing. I've been schooled, dog.
I'm trying to tell you.

03:06.591 --> 03:08.752
- All right, all right.
- For real.

04:52.823 --> 04:56.010
Seven and counting.

04:56.158 --> 05:00.280
All of them
caught on the wire.

05:00.428 --> 05:02.783
We're not above the corners yet,
but we soon will be.

05:02.931 --> 05:05.453
- They're not dumping phones?
- Every month or so.

05:05.601 --> 05:08.055
Sloppy enough that we may be able
to track a phone or two

05:08.203 --> 05:10.057
up to Marlo or the people
he keeps close.

05:10.204 --> 05:12.225
Truth is, if they're
still using cell phones

05:12.372 --> 05:14.193
in this day and age,
they're mine.

05:14.341 --> 05:16.196
And if Marlo Stanfield
is on a cell,

05:16.344 --> 05:18.764
- he'll be mine too.
- Cool Lester smooth.

05:18.912 --> 05:21.567
That's not trash talk, darling.
That's simple fact.

05:21.714 --> 05:24.937
Marlo Stanfield may have a lot of heart
and a lot of corners,

05:25.084 --> 05:26.238
but he's a babe
in the woods

05:26.386 --> 05:28.073
when it comes
to this right here.

05:28.221 --> 05:31.309
I was proud to be chasing those
Barksdales, but this Stanfield kid...

05:31.457 --> 05:33.143
Not as fierce
as we thought.

05:33.292 --> 05:36.013
For months now, there hasn't been
a body we can put to him.

05:36.161 --> 05:39.317
- Hmm.
- You two sound disappointed.

05:39.464 --> 05:42.586
This unit needs good, hard targets,
or it'll go soft.

05:42.734 --> 05:44.588
Be that as it may,
I'll assume you want

05:44.735 --> 05:46.724
- another 30 days on your taps.
- At least.

05:46.871 --> 05:49.293
And we've got subpoenas
to go out this week as well.

05:49.441 --> 05:52.996
- Subpoenas?
- Asset investigations.

05:53.144 --> 05:55.976
- On Marlo Stanfield?
- Come here.

05:59.415 --> 06:02.337
All this is
from the Barksdale money trail.

06:02.485 --> 06:04.207
We've been running
down all the paper

06:04.354 --> 06:06.041
we pulled out of
Stringer's apartment

06:06.189 --> 06:07.908
and the B & B
office downtown.

06:08.057 --> 06:12.347
- I miss Prez, man. I do.
- I hear you.

06:12.494 --> 06:15.049
The truth is, those guys had
money going everywhere--

06:15.197 --> 06:18.953
investments, political donations,
consulting fees...

06:19.101 --> 06:20.286
You want to do this now?

06:20.434 --> 06:22.922
I wanted to do
this a year ago,

06:23.071 --> 06:24.924
but fresh cases
got in the way.

06:25.073 --> 06:27.560
And your lieutenant's gonna
okay this kind of paper?

06:27.708 --> 06:30.871
Our lieutenant has
a fearless heart.

06:32.979 --> 06:35.068
- This will get you started.
- Whoa whoa whoa.

06:35.216 --> 06:36.835
Wait wait wait.
Wait right there.

06:36.983 --> 06:39.571
My coupons.

06:39.719 --> 06:41.473
You were gonna give
this lady my coupons.

06:41.621 --> 06:42.741
Been clipping them
for two days,

06:42.889 --> 06:44.676
and you damn near sent them out
with your mess.

06:44.825 --> 06:46.245
Well, why are they
in my pile?

06:46.393 --> 06:47.813
Why is your pile
in my workspace?

06:47.960 --> 06:49.347
Because I'm doing
real work!

06:49.495 --> 06:51.725
Working my nerves
is what you've been doing.

06:59.037 --> 07:01.124
Four weeks before
the Baltimore City primary,

07:01.272 --> 07:03.593
you hand me a stack
of drug-money subpoenas

07:03.741 --> 07:06.402
that hit a dozen
key political figures.

07:07.845 --> 07:09.665
There's an election?

07:09.814 --> 07:11.768
Who's running?

07:11.915 --> 07:13.636
...and they think I can't.

07:13.784 --> 07:16.604
Shit, I don't think we can
take four more years of this guy.

07:16.752 --> 07:18.207
This city's in the toilet.

07:18.355 --> 07:20.309
That's what they said
during my term, too.

07:20.457 --> 07:22.044
Yeah well, you got
dealt a bad hand,

07:22.192 --> 07:24.480
- I mean, with the riots and all.
- Yeah, sure.

07:24.627 --> 07:26.081
Anyway, I think
I'll squeeze in

07:26.229 --> 07:28.115
if Tony Gray draws off
25%, 26% of the vote,

07:28.263 --> 07:30.150
because most of that's
out of Royce's base.

07:30.298 --> 07:33.221
25% is a big number for Gray,
don't you think?

07:33.369 --> 07:35.490
I don't know.
Royce's negatives are up--

07:35.637 --> 07:37.457
even among black voters.

07:37.606 --> 07:39.625
Yeah.
In a minute, Norman.

07:39.773 --> 07:41.327
You know what
I think, Tommy?

07:41.475 --> 07:43.463
No matter what,
you got your name out there,

07:43.612 --> 07:45.164
and it'll help you
down the road

07:45.312 --> 07:47.533
if you ever want to step up
to the legislature.

07:47.681 --> 07:49.668
But as one paisan to another,

07:49.816 --> 07:52.704
the day of the white mayor
is over in this town.

07:52.853 --> 07:54.206
Excuse me,
Your Eminence.

07:54.355 --> 07:56.408
You're due at the Baylor-Edison
Senior Center,

07:56.556 --> 07:58.543
and I don't want to be lying
to a roomful of wrinkle-assed voters

07:58.691 --> 08:00.645
because you wanted to talk shop
all the damn morning.

08:00.792 --> 08:03.414
Seniors, huh?
They vote, Tommy.

08:03.562 --> 08:05.463
Got to run. Sorry.

08:08.601 --> 08:11.322
The candidate's on your clock.
Don't ever let him forget it.

08:11.470 --> 08:12.630
No, indeed.

08:18.542 --> 08:20.297
Need your sig
on vehicle logs

08:20.444 --> 08:22.031
and a corrected court report

08:22.179 --> 08:24.466
and office memo
subpoena requests

08:24.615 --> 08:27.669
and a requisition due
to City Purchasing for a large fan.

08:27.817 --> 08:29.272
A fan, huh?

08:29.420 --> 08:31.140
Caroline says it stays hot

08:31.288 --> 08:33.414
in the wire room
with the door closed.

08:34.658 --> 08:36.812
Oh. It's beautiful,
Lieutenant.

08:36.958 --> 08:39.881
- I've never seen a beach house so fine.
- You think so?

08:40.030 --> 08:41.916
Shit. Makes me think
about retirement,

08:42.063 --> 08:44.152
and I only got
nine years on.

08:44.300 --> 08:46.154
When do you break ground?

08:46.301 --> 08:48.388
Next March,
if I have my permits,

08:48.536 --> 08:50.157
which reminds me--
on Tuesday,

08:50.305 --> 08:52.560
I have to get over to Delaware
and see my contractor.

08:52.708 --> 08:53.660
Oh, no problem.

08:53.808 --> 08:57.369
Me and Lester, we'll cover for you
on that. No problem at all.

09:18.264 --> 09:20.251
Cake.

09:20.399 --> 09:21.718
You know what
I'm saying, yo?

09:21.867 --> 09:24.022
That's my baby's mother
we talking about, yo.

09:24.169 --> 09:25.857
But y'all been broke up,
right?

09:26.005 --> 09:27.457
Man, I ain't living
with her or nothing,

09:27.605 --> 09:29.827
but I still be giving her
a couple dollars here and there,

09:29.975 --> 09:31.494
you know,
stop and pass.

09:31.643 --> 09:34.531
Pandemic! Pandemic!

09:34.678 --> 09:36.767
Look at this.

09:36.915 --> 09:38.769
Hey, Nay.

09:38.917 --> 09:40.603
- Namond!
- Hmm?

09:40.751 --> 09:43.005
What the fuck am l
paying you for, nigga?

09:43.153 --> 09:45.140
Oh, my fault, B.

09:45.288 --> 09:46.608
Damn!

09:46.756 --> 09:48.811
Yo man, and do something
with that ponytail.

09:48.959 --> 09:50.847
Cops can make his ass
from a mile away.

09:50.994 --> 09:54.416
Braid it or something!

09:54.563 --> 09:57.484
Yeah, you know, me and Patrice
been together for a long time.

09:57.633 --> 10:00.322
Yeah, but you say she running
with the boy Fruit now, right?

10:00.470 --> 10:02.990
Yeah. If he don't back
the fuck off,

10:03.139 --> 10:06.093
I'm gonna fill his ass
with some hot ones, yo.

10:06.241 --> 10:08.796
Shit. You don't
think I will?

10:08.943 --> 10:10.707
I got that pandemic.

10:13.148 --> 10:14.734
Man...

10:14.883 --> 10:16.236
do what you gonna do.

10:16.384 --> 10:18.010
- Bodie.
- What's up, big man?

10:19.619 --> 10:22.208
You ain't real with us
all week, man.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.009
You stepping
on that package or what?

10:24.158 --> 10:25.510
Yo, man,
everything's slow.

10:25.659 --> 10:28.380
It been slow since we moved
down here from Fayette Street.

10:28.528 --> 10:30.648
Yeah, well,
Marlo wanted Fayette.

10:30.796 --> 10:33.785
Man, I do not like backing down
from niggas, man.

10:33.933 --> 10:36.121
I feel like a punk.
I feel like doing shit.

10:36.268 --> 10:38.290
Ain't like
the old days, dog.

10:38.437 --> 10:40.658
Mayor Barksdale left.

10:40.805 --> 10:42.865
You out here
on your own, dog.

10:44.743 --> 10:45.835
Give it up.

10:47.413 --> 10:49.312
B, let's roll.

10:54.551 --> 10:56.239
Hey, Lex, man,

10:56.386 --> 10:59.208
I'm gonna give you the truth
because you need the truth.

10:59.356 --> 11:01.310
That boy Marlo got
the world by the ass.

11:01.458 --> 11:03.345
And Fruit,
he work for Marlo.

11:03.493 --> 11:05.647
So I'm saying,
fuck that bitch.

11:05.795 --> 11:07.282
Pfft.
And move on.

11:07.431 --> 11:10.451
- That's just the way it is.
- Yeah.

11:10.599 --> 11:13.568
- That's just the way it is, man.
- Pandemic!

11:45.699 --> 11:47.859
Thank you, sir.

11:48.968 --> 11:50.588
Just one moment,
ma'am.

11:50.736 --> 11:51.622
You seen Hoskins?

11:51.770 --> 11:53.466
Lieutenant went
upstairs already.

11:54.774 --> 11:55.967
Step through, please.

12:06.551 --> 12:07.950
Madam President.

12:13.022 --> 12:15.979
Council president's
hot as balls.

12:16.127 --> 12:20.015
- I'd fuck you to fuck her, man.
- Yeah?

12:20.163 --> 12:22.417
You'd fuck a guy for a chance
to fuck a hot broad?

12:22.565 --> 12:24.853
You don't think that makes you
a faggot or nothing?

12:25.000 --> 12:26.935
It's just
an expression, man.

12:39.214 --> 12:41.836
Been on this detail
how long?

12:41.984 --> 12:43.036
Eight months.

12:43.184 --> 12:45.584
Eight months
with Clarence Royce.

12:47.320 --> 12:48.941
So let me ask,

12:49.089 --> 12:52.320
are you ready to take a bullet
for the Mayor of Baltimore?

13:05.037 --> 13:06.491
Lieutenant, sir.

13:06.639 --> 13:08.493
Is the truck okay,
or do we want to call one?

13:08.640 --> 13:09.938
No, the truck works.

13:13.846 --> 13:15.939
He said he needed
just 10 minutes.

13:17.115 --> 13:19.535
No, not now.

13:19.683 --> 13:21.048
Maybe tomorrow.

13:22.920 --> 13:24.573
Is that Krawczyk again?

13:24.722 --> 13:26.176
Every time he writes
another check,

13:26.324 --> 13:28.144
he turns around
and calls for something

13:28.292 --> 13:29.452
just to see that he can.

13:30.561 --> 13:32.580
Getting calls
from Carcetti's people, too.

13:32.729 --> 13:34.816
They want one debate
for crime and safety,

13:34.965 --> 13:37.085
the other on economic stuff
and schools,

13:37.234 --> 13:38.720
Tony Gray crying
the same blues.

13:38.868 --> 13:40.455
Like they're gonna
get the whole night

13:40.603 --> 13:42.023
to smack me
with the crime rate.

13:42.170 --> 13:44.224
I told "The Sun" paper
we're open to any format,

13:44.372 --> 13:45.893
which we'll be
for another couple days or so,

13:46.041 --> 13:48.696
in which time we'll say,
"Fuck you. One debate."

13:48.843 --> 13:50.868
Two debates. Shit!

13:53.782 --> 13:57.370
That lost-ball-in-high-grass
motherfucker Carcetti.

13:57.518 --> 13:59.940
He needs to get used to
life in the wilderness,

14:00.088 --> 14:01.608
and not just
the downtown areas,

14:01.756 --> 14:04.877
but your communities here
on the East Side.

14:05.025 --> 14:07.312
We stand
or we fall together,

14:07.460 --> 14:10.657
and I'm here today to ask
for the chance to stand with you.

14:11.765 --> 14:13.718
Thank you
for your time.

14:13.866 --> 14:15.595
Questions?

14:20.138 --> 14:21.592
Yes, ma'am?

14:21.741 --> 14:25.162
Is it the Salisbury steak
for lunch today,

14:25.310 --> 14:27.675
or is they doing tacos?

14:34.185 --> 14:36.239
Because it's developments
like this one,

14:36.387 --> 14:37.707
planned residential towers

14:37.855 --> 14:41.009
with waterside retail space
and restaurants

14:41.157 --> 14:45.381
that grow Baltimore's tax base
and help rebuild our city.

14:45.529 --> 14:48.884
I want to thank Ed Bowers
for his vision,

14:49.032 --> 14:51.920
but more important,
for his commitment--

14:52.068 --> 14:54.468
for his commitment
to the City of Baltimore.

14:55.572 --> 14:56.698
Ed.

15:04.212 --> 15:05.699
Mr. Mayor,

15:05.848 --> 15:08.903
I want to thank you
and your administration,

15:09.051 --> 15:11.738
for making this next stage
of redevelopment

15:11.886 --> 15:14.649
for Baltimore's harbor
a reality.

15:17.392 --> 15:20.213
You talk about vision
and commitment--

15:20.360 --> 15:22.191
Mayor Clarence Royce.

15:34.007 --> 15:36.405
Pandemic! Pandemic!

15:40.478 --> 15:42.065
What up, Nay?

15:42.213 --> 15:44.134
Yo, what up?

15:44.283 --> 15:46.436
- What you got?
- Nothing.

15:46.584 --> 15:48.939
It's just a story about
A.J. from North & Woods.

15:49.087 --> 15:51.007
Yo, you know
they gave him 700 years?

15:51.155 --> 15:53.109
Read this shit, son.

15:53.257 --> 15:56.279
This corner is dead, man.
You still working?

15:56.427 --> 15:58.481
Yeah, because we was gonna
gonna go under the road

15:58.629 --> 16:00.582
- and catch some fresh birds.
- I don't know.

16:00.730 --> 16:02.595
Let me see if I can bounce.
Hold up.

16:06.570 --> 16:08.924
- Hey, B.
- What's up?

16:09.072 --> 16:10.492
I wanted to know
if I could leave early

16:10.640 --> 16:12.293
because me and the fellas
want to go down to Mondawmin

16:12.441 --> 16:13.727
for some back-to-school stuff.

16:13.875 --> 16:15.530
What you need
back-to-school stuff for?

16:15.678 --> 16:17.031
Your ass stay suspended.

16:17.179 --> 16:18.566
Come on,
stop playing, B.

16:18.714 --> 16:20.301
Hey, if it wasn't
for social promotion,

16:20.449 --> 16:22.869
your ass would still be
in pre-K, motherfucker.

16:23.017 --> 16:25.271
Probably daycare
up this bitch.

16:25.419 --> 16:26.978
Pandemic right here!

16:28.390 --> 16:30.009
Fuck it.
Hey, yo, man.

16:30.157 --> 16:33.378
Pay this late-to-work, early-to-play
nigger out for five hours, yo.

16:33.527 --> 16:36.552
Yo, you owe me extra time
tomorrow, though.

16:37.631 --> 16:40.285
Lex! Did you hear me?

16:40.433 --> 16:42.654
Damn, y'all!

16:42.802 --> 16:45.389
Young'uns don't got a scrap
of work ethic nowadays, man.

16:45.538 --> 16:47.698
If it wasn't for his pops,
I wouldn't even bother.

16:49.642 --> 16:50.729
Yo!

16:50.877 --> 16:52.330
Make sure you come
early tomorrow

16:52.478 --> 16:54.898
because it ain't always
gonna be this slow.

16:55.047 --> 16:57.735
Pandemic!

16:57.882 --> 16:59.637
At least
I hope it ain't.

16:59.784 --> 17:01.838
Mr. Mayor.

17:01.986 --> 17:03.640
Mr. Mayor, excuse me.

17:03.788 --> 17:05.541
I just want to make sure
we're still okay

17:05.690 --> 17:08.377
for that median cut
on Boston Street.

17:08.525 --> 17:11.214
I really need that access
to make the site viable.

17:11.362 --> 17:13.483
Right. I'll get
my people on it.

17:13.631 --> 17:14.961
Thank you, sir.

17:22.204 --> 17:24.592
Something going on
with his median?

17:24.740 --> 17:27.262
Not once he ponies up.

17:27.410 --> 17:30.465
I think he can do a lot better
than the 4,000,

17:30.613 --> 17:32.065
don't you?

17:32.213 --> 17:34.114
I don't even
want to know.

17:37.119 --> 17:39.506
No, Chris, please, man.

17:39.654 --> 17:41.475
We're low
on quicklime, man.

17:41.623 --> 17:43.175
Doesn't matter.

17:43.324 --> 17:46.191
We got vacants on both sides.
He'll stink is all.

17:50.798 --> 17:52.417
Chris, please.

17:52.566 --> 17:54.853
Don't fret, boss.
I got you covered.

17:55.001 --> 17:57.698
Quick and clean,
I promise.

18:05.444 --> 18:06.638
Chr--

18:53.020 --> 18:55.743
Man, shit like that don't even
work in them cartoons.

18:55.891 --> 18:58.311
The roadrunner just snatch
the birdseed and book.

18:58.459 --> 19:00.747
- We ain't in no cartoon.
- Yeah, you is.

19:00.895 --> 19:02.581
Shh! Be still.

19:02.729 --> 19:04.249
Yeah, you scaring away
the birds.

19:04.397 --> 19:06.386
I'm talking to both y'all.

19:06.533 --> 19:08.954
Took me off the clock
for this craziness?

19:09.103 --> 19:11.590
- What the fuck is you thinking?
- We're serious, Nay.

19:11.738 --> 19:13.224
This bird could be worth
like 300 or 400.

19:13.373 --> 19:14.826
Nigga, please.

19:14.974 --> 19:17.195
Yo, you know the boy Nemo
who worked Marlo's pigeon coop?

19:17.344 --> 19:19.464
Said he got 400
for a white homing bird.

19:19.613 --> 19:21.866
- And that's a homer?
- I mean, it's white.

19:22.014 --> 19:24.836
- So that makes it a homer, right?
- It could be.

19:24.983 --> 19:26.770
Damn! Son, you need to put
some hamburger meat in that trap.

19:26.918 --> 19:28.205
That shit would've been got.

19:28.354 --> 19:29.752
Shut your mouth,
it'd have been got.

19:36.293 --> 19:39.229
I'm gonna fuck
this nigga up.

19:41.098 --> 19:42.952
Hey yo, what the fuck
is wrong with you,

19:43.100 --> 19:44.987
throwing bottles
and shit, huh?

19:45.135 --> 19:46.589
You just cost us cash money,
you know that?

19:46.737 --> 19:48.189
I ain't done nothing.

19:48.337 --> 19:50.860
You're a seriously backwards dude.
You know that, right?

19:51.008 --> 19:52.494
Playing with bugs
like he's still in Pampers.

19:52.643 --> 19:54.095
That wasn't even necessary.

19:54.243 --> 19:55.830
Nah, you don't want
any Pampers.

19:55.978 --> 19:57.132
Put them over
that mouth you got.

19:57.280 --> 19:58.500
Catch all that shit
you be flushing.

19:58.648 --> 20:00.706
- Ohh!
- Ooh!

20:02.652 --> 20:04.638
Y'all be stinking
like rat fart.

20:04.786 --> 20:05.706
There you go!

20:05.854 --> 20:08.515
- Oh oh!
- Get him!

20:10.024 --> 20:11.078
All right, all right.

20:11.225 --> 20:13.347
Come on, come on,
come on. Come on.

20:13.495 --> 20:15.015
Y'all acting like
little bitches.

20:15.163 --> 20:16.583
Yo, you seen
my man Duke?

20:16.730 --> 20:18.151
Clocked him, got him
upside his head.

20:18.299 --> 20:19.985
Only because I didn't
want to get too close

20:20.134 --> 20:21.453
and touch
the dirty motherfucker.

20:21.601 --> 20:23.321
Could have come up with AlDS
or some shit like that.

20:23.469 --> 20:25.334
Dukie fight
like a bitch, yo.

20:27.840 --> 20:30.968
I would have whipped that ass
if I didn't feel sorry for him.

20:32.211 --> 20:33.931
Duke, man,
you scared away the birds.

20:34.079 --> 20:35.199
I blew me up
a bug bomb.

20:35.347 --> 20:36.835
You want to come
and see the pieces?

20:36.983 --> 20:39.271
Nah, I'm good.
I got to go.

20:39.419 --> 20:41.105
All right.

20:41.253 --> 20:42.873
Hey hey, Randy.

20:43.021 --> 20:44.674
That pigeon
wasn't a homer.

20:44.822 --> 20:47.011
Homers got them metal things
around their leg.

20:47.159 --> 20:49.346
That way you can tell them
from the other birds.

20:49.494 --> 20:50.914
How you know that?

20:51.062 --> 20:52.816
You know Nemo let me clean
out his coop sometimes.

20:52.964 --> 20:54.760
So... he was schooling me.

21:08.110 --> 21:10.599
...which leaves us
a total of 54.

21:10.747 --> 21:13.401
No surprises on who's coming back--
all the regulars.

21:13.549 --> 21:15.736
We lost Mr. Parker
and Ms. Bowles.

21:15.884 --> 21:18.105
- Gregory's leaving?
- Hired by the county.

21:18.253 --> 21:20.273
And Bowles, I knew
she wasn't coming back,

21:20.421 --> 21:23.009
the way they tore up
her classroom.

21:23.158 --> 21:26.217
So we're short two in math
and four in science.

21:28.128 --> 21:29.549
Man at the door.

21:29.697 --> 21:31.383
No system l.D.,
but says he's new here.

21:31.531 --> 21:34.295
Well, buzz him in before
something changes his mind.

21:38.538 --> 21:39.971
All the way
on the left.

21:41.540 --> 21:43.528
Pull it hard.

21:43.676 --> 21:46.431
- Hard!
- It's locked.

21:46.579 --> 21:48.067
All right.
I'll be right down.

21:48.214 --> 21:51.202
Not a goddamn thing up in here
works like it should.

21:51.349 --> 21:53.403
Well, you turn to
the cafeteria assignments,

21:53.551 --> 21:55.974
and you see that's gonna leave
Ernest alone for second period,

21:56.121 --> 21:57.748
and he can't handle it alone.

22:00.959 --> 22:04.180
You tell them, because I ain't even
gonna try to pronounce it.

22:04.328 --> 22:06.082
Roland Pryzbylewski.

22:06.230 --> 22:08.284
Everyone just
calls me "Prez."

22:08.433 --> 22:10.286
Claudell Withers.
I'm principal here.

22:10.435 --> 22:11.888
New in math.

22:12.036 --> 22:14.222
I won't have my certificate
until next year,

22:14.370 --> 22:15.858
but with the resident
teachers' program,

22:16.005 --> 22:17.859
they said I'd be
getting classes

22:18.008 --> 22:19.095
because of staff shortages?

22:19.243 --> 22:22.497
Jesus.
Lambs to the slaughter here.

22:22.645 --> 22:26.500
What did you do before you decided
to teach, Mr. Pryzbylewski?

22:26.648 --> 22:29.618
I was a police...
in the city.

22:32.955 --> 22:35.876
Marcia Donnelly,
Assistant Principal.

22:36.024 --> 22:38.218
Welcome to
Edward Tilghman Middle.

22:39.760 --> 22:42.048
That leaves Tullman,
as I see 'em, for the 12th.

22:42.197 --> 22:44.050
You think he can handle
the whole shift?

22:44.199 --> 22:45.652
Now, which one's
Tullman, again?

22:45.800 --> 22:48.354
Goofy redhead, kind of
looks like Opie from Mayberry,

22:48.502 --> 22:49.798
but less fierce.

22:51.504 --> 22:53.597
Jimmy,
Major wants to see you.

22:56.242 --> 22:58.210
Jimmy, come on in.

23:03.817 --> 23:06.437
I know I offered
when I first came over here,

23:06.585 --> 23:09.006
and I know your answer then,
but I'm still asking.

23:09.154 --> 23:10.774
Can I get you
out of a radio car?

23:10.922 --> 23:12.480
No thank you, Major.

23:14.292 --> 23:16.279
McNulty, I'm short
two men in Ops,

23:16.427 --> 23:19.350
and my follow-up squad
couldn't make a case to save its life.

23:19.497 --> 23:21.651
You're too damn good
to be humping calls.

23:21.799 --> 23:23.357
Thanks for the offer,
though.

23:28.371 --> 23:32.261
You don't think I asked him 10 times
when I was acting commander?

23:32.409 --> 23:34.129
He's in the wrong
fucking place.

23:34.277 --> 23:35.676
For us, yeah.

23:37.681 --> 23:39.113
For him...

23:42.219 --> 23:45.152
Yo, po-po, man.
Po-po. Shut it down.

23:53.394 --> 23:54.781
Where is the love, Bodie?

23:54.928 --> 23:56.683
Where is the motherfucking love?

23:56.831 --> 23:58.517
I go back so far
with this kid,

23:58.665 --> 24:00.086
I was chasing him
through juvie.

24:00.235 --> 24:02.021
But does any of that matter
when we roll up here?

24:02.169 --> 24:04.223
I get so much as a wave,
a nod, a smile?

24:04.371 --> 24:05.360
Nothing.

24:07.940 --> 24:10.996
- How about just hello?
- Hello.

24:11.144 --> 24:13.612
See? That wasn't
so hard, was it?

24:14.914 --> 24:17.268
Lex, my man,
how's your day going?

24:17.416 --> 24:18.903
Not to criticize
or anything,

24:19.051 --> 24:20.738
but I think you missed
a spot there.

24:20.886 --> 24:22.840
Little Kevin,
how's it hanging?

24:22.989 --> 24:25.042
Reesey, you look like
someone just shot your dog.

24:25.190 --> 24:26.944
You all right, man?
You okay?

24:27.092 --> 24:28.845
Reesey still messing up
the count?

24:28.994 --> 24:30.014
You hear what he said?

24:30.161 --> 24:32.116
Yo, dog, you send him up
to Lamelle next month.

24:32.264 --> 24:34.150
I'll make sure Ms. Davis
puts him in remedial math,

24:34.298 --> 24:35.561
and we'll have done
some good here today.

24:38.669 --> 24:39.829
Fucking cop, man.

24:44.174 --> 24:45.160
Everything good?

24:45.308 --> 24:46.929
Yeah. Just words.

24:47.077 --> 24:49.498
Mr. Entrapment,
how you doing?

24:49.646 --> 24:52.434
Don't look like that.
I'm still dining out on that story.

24:52.582 --> 24:55.269
You know how he beat
the wiretap a year ago?

24:55.417 --> 24:58.774
Claimed entrapment when he was clocking
in Bunny Colvin's Hamsterdam.

24:58.921 --> 25:00.375
Shit you not.

25:00.523 --> 25:02.510
Smart kiddo.
I loved it.

25:02.658 --> 25:04.879
When I roll back in an hour,
this corner's bone-dry.

25:05.027 --> 25:06.823
Your people are done
for the day.

25:08.864 --> 25:11.385
Okay.
So let's try this again.

25:11.533 --> 25:15.559
I say, "Have a good evening,
Mr. Broadus."

25:17.038 --> 25:19.425
And a good evening to you,
Sergeant Carver.

25:19.573 --> 25:22.702
See?
We're right here.

25:25.579 --> 25:28.634
And a very good evening
to you, Officer Colicchio.

25:28.782 --> 25:30.908
Fuck yourself with a 40,
shitbreath.

25:34.386 --> 25:36.007
What the fuck
was all that about?

25:36.155 --> 25:38.509
- You can't bust every head, Tony.
- I can't?

25:38.656 --> 25:41.784
Bust every head, who are you
gonna talk to when the shit happens?

25:52.369 --> 25:54.065
Hi, Rachel.

25:56.473 --> 25:59.408
- Tim, thanks for doing that yesterday.
- Yeah, no problem.

26:04.447 --> 26:06.235
You ran late all morning--

26:06.383 --> 26:09.037
Late for the seniors, late for
the Stonewall meeting with Della.

26:09.185 --> 26:10.705
Late for the Gay-Lesbian Alliance.

26:10.853 --> 26:12.707
Them seniors,
they talk slow.

26:12.855 --> 26:15.143
Bullshit. It was breakfast
with Young Tony

26:15.291 --> 26:17.412
when they sat there swapping
stories over cold coffee.

26:17.560 --> 26:20.114
- Young Tony, huh?
- I was getting sage advice--

26:20.263 --> 26:22.282
- From a one-term mayor?
- It wasn't his fault.

26:22.430 --> 26:24.651
He takes over in '67,
sees the city burn.

26:24.799 --> 26:26.085
That was an opportunity.

26:26.233 --> 26:28.689
Spiro Agnew made his whole career
on the '68 Riots.

26:28.837 --> 26:30.323
- Agnew?
- One man's shithead's

26:30.471 --> 26:31.925
another man's vice president.

26:32.073 --> 26:34.293
- True today as it ever was.
- Hey, is that polling data?

26:34.441 --> 26:36.395
Raw numbers.
It's incomplete.

26:36.543 --> 26:39.532
Right now, you need to be
in the call room dialing for dollars.

26:39.680 --> 26:42.334
Aw, fuck!
I can't do it anymore!

26:42.482 --> 26:44.970
I hate it. I hate it
more than anything.

26:45.118 --> 26:47.104
- I fucking hate it!
- You don't do this,

26:47.252 --> 26:49.174
you don't have the money to pay
for the damn TV spots

26:49.322 --> 26:50.408
in the last two weeks.

26:50.555 --> 26:53.678
Aw, mothersucking
cockfuckers.

26:53.826 --> 26:56.623
Oh, Jesus.
I fucking hate this.

26:58.363 --> 26:59.750
Hey there, Jim.

26:59.897 --> 27:01.885
Tom Carcetti here,
remember me?

27:02.033 --> 27:03.454
We met at your sister's house--

27:03.602 --> 27:06.230
you know, the one that's married
to that Republican cunt.

27:07.838 --> 27:09.292
I know you
don't remember me.

27:09.440 --> 27:11.593
I know you don't have any use
for fucking politicians,

27:11.741 --> 27:14.264
and frankly, I don't give a flying fuck
about what you think

27:14.412 --> 27:16.032
or what your concerns are.

27:16.179 --> 27:18.300
But I do care about what
your cute little blonde wife

27:18.448 --> 27:19.835
thinks about so many things.

27:19.983 --> 27:22.136
But, Jim, the reason
I'm calling is because

27:22.285 --> 27:25.406
I want you to write me out
a check for $4,000,

27:25.555 --> 27:27.242
the maximum allowed by law.

27:27.390 --> 27:29.510
Because we don't trust you
to actually mail that check,

27:29.658 --> 27:32.079
we're gonna send over a couple
of furloughed DPW workers

27:32.226 --> 27:34.414
to beat the check out of you.

27:34.563 --> 27:37.218
All finished?
You need $30,000...

27:37.366 --> 27:39.786
in the next three hours.
No bullshit, Tommy.

27:39.934 --> 27:42.355
You hit your number
or die in this room.

27:42.503 --> 27:44.061
Yeah, whatever.

28:33.417 --> 28:35.317
So what are you
watching, then?

28:36.587 --> 28:37.848
Anything on the tube?

28:42.924 --> 28:44.646
No fucking way.

28:44.794 --> 28:47.114
They got enough power
in the middle of the lineup.

28:47.262 --> 28:49.026
What they need is pitching.

29:24.830 --> 29:27.417
What you looking at?

29:27.565 --> 29:29.552
Fucking crazy.

29:29.700 --> 29:32.923
Oh, like I'm really gonna give
that motherfucker a ride to Woodlawn.

29:33.071 --> 29:34.561
Shit.

29:36.274 --> 29:37.727
Help! Somebody help!

29:37.875 --> 29:39.273
What's up, Patrice?

29:48.852 --> 29:50.939
You're letting it ring,
right?

29:51.088 --> 29:52.908
You're not hanging up
after a ring or two?

29:53.056 --> 29:54.576
I'm making
the calls, Terri.

29:54.724 --> 29:56.745
I don't know what to say.
Nobody's home.

29:56.893 --> 29:58.917
30,000, Tommy.

30:11.406 --> 30:13.893
You mean Lex, the boy
who used to go with Patrice?

30:14.041 --> 30:16.462
Lester!

30:16.611 --> 30:17.564
He her baby's daddy.

30:17.712 --> 30:18.931
He ain't the first one
to get his spurt.

30:19.079 --> 30:20.733
You ain't got to
talk like that.

30:20.881 --> 30:24.169
Nigga just walked up to him outside
of the Paragon and served him up.

30:24.317 --> 30:25.737
One to the face.
Whap!

30:25.886 --> 30:28.673
Shoot.
He was real cute.

30:28.821 --> 30:31.776
Lex and his nine took all the cute
out of that lazy-eye motherfucker.

30:31.924 --> 30:33.278
Anything on Fruit's phone?

30:33.426 --> 30:36.014
Nothing. I've gone
for two hours.

30:36.162 --> 30:38.015
- Sure.
- It's no problem, though.

30:38.163 --> 30:41.118
Sure. I really
need your help.

30:41.266 --> 30:44.355
- Put me down for four.
- Yeah.

30:44.503 --> 30:45.688
What about your wife?

30:45.836 --> 30:47.357
Think she can
come up with four?

30:47.505 --> 30:49.525
- I don't think we can do eight.
- The kids?

30:49.674 --> 30:51.128
They're in strollers.

30:51.276 --> 30:52.662
I know they're in strollers.
I was kidding.

30:52.810 --> 30:53.830
That's funny.

30:53.978 --> 30:55.498
Yeah, never mind.
4,000 is good.

30:55.646 --> 30:56.632
- Thanks.
- No problem.

30:56.780 --> 30:59.334
One to the left temple.

30:59.482 --> 31:01.237
Close range in a lot
full of club trash,

31:01.385 --> 31:04.606
- but of course, nobody sees a thing.
- Hmm.

31:04.754 --> 31:08.143
- We hear your shooter goes by "Lex."
- Lex?

31:08.290 --> 31:10.344
We were up
on your victim's cell phone, too.

31:10.492 --> 31:12.881
We'll go back through the calls,
send you whatever's there.

31:13.029 --> 31:15.283
Got this from his pocket.

31:15.431 --> 31:18.219
You can pull the numbers from that
as a consolation prize.

31:18.367 --> 31:21.488
This fucks you guys up, don't it?
Losing a guy you had wired?

31:21.637 --> 31:24.458
Nah. We're up on several phones
on the street level.

31:24.605 --> 31:27.827
With or without Mr. Fruit,
we're on our way.

31:27.975 --> 31:29.629
You know, it's strange.

31:29.777 --> 31:31.997
We're not seeing bodies.

31:32.146 --> 31:34.400
This is the first drug hit
in months,

31:34.548 --> 31:36.403
and it's Marlo's boy who falls.

31:36.551 --> 31:39.806
- I thought Marlo was the new power.
- He is.

31:39.953 --> 31:43.609
Shit, he's got everything
from MLK to Fulton now.

31:43.756 --> 31:45.610
How do you hold
that much real estate

31:45.758 --> 31:48.580
without making bodies?

31:48.728 --> 31:51.616
You hear anything more about
this murder on your wire, Lester,

31:51.764 --> 31:53.451
the Bunk expects a call.

31:53.598 --> 31:55.485
Yeah, I know he does.

31:55.634 --> 31:58.389
Oh! The hell with Norris.

31:58.537 --> 32:01.292
You're my real partner, Lester.
My life partner.

32:01.440 --> 32:03.407
Don't tease, bitch.

32:05.576 --> 32:07.963
Look at that
bowlegged motherfucker.

32:08.111 --> 32:09.602
I made him
walk like that.

32:23.193 --> 32:25.183
So who the fuck
is Lex?

32:26.295 --> 32:27.649
Dontrelle's cousin.

32:27.797 --> 32:29.283
Used to be with
Cantel's people.

32:29.432 --> 32:31.953
He working some corner
over the Hilltop now.

32:32.101 --> 32:34.021
He ain't more connected
than that?

32:34.170 --> 32:35.557
And he coming near
one of mine?

32:35.705 --> 32:37.257
Wasn't about no business.

32:37.405 --> 32:39.258
Pussy, man.

32:39.407 --> 32:41.829
Yo, Fruit was into something
that Lex thought was his own.

32:41.976 --> 32:44.730
You say the word, we take off
that whole motherfucking corner

32:44.878 --> 32:46.133
every last one
of them bitches.

32:46.280 --> 32:48.267
What corner are we
talking about, again?

32:48.416 --> 32:50.203
Rag-tag shit up
on Pacer.

32:50.350 --> 32:51.937
Man, they get
their shit from Joe,

32:52.085 --> 32:53.839
but they're
mostly independent.

32:53.987 --> 32:55.975
They gone, Marlo.
Just say so.

32:56.122 --> 32:58.777
That what you think?
Just do them all?

32:58.926 --> 33:00.620
And take their
fucking corner, too.

33:06.032 --> 33:08.420
What do I want with
some off-brand Hilltop corner?

33:08.567 --> 33:10.822
And why I need
to be stacking bodies

33:10.969 --> 33:13.124
when there ain't no one
trying to war with us?

33:13.272 --> 33:15.792
Just Lex.

33:15.941 --> 33:18.101
He did one of ours,
so he got to fall.

33:37.727 --> 33:39.626
Get out, Tommy.
You're done.

33:44.400 --> 33:45.958
Get up, Tommy!

33:49.705 --> 33:51.559
Come on, pretty boy.
Come on.

33:51.707 --> 33:53.828
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

33:53.976 --> 33:56.463
- Come on. Let's go.
- That's home?

33:56.611 --> 33:59.031
Yeah. That's it.

33:59.180 --> 34:01.647
There we go,
little trooper.

34:09.523 --> 34:10.943
6:30 tomorrow morning.

34:11.090 --> 34:14.280
Don't make me drag you out of bed
like you did yesterday.

34:14.428 --> 34:15.918
Mm-hmm.

34:26.772 --> 34:29.069
Damn, boy,
what happened to you?

34:30.074 --> 34:31.261
Terrace Boys banged me

34:31.409 --> 34:33.529
coming across the tracks
over there by Ramsey Street.

34:33.677 --> 34:36.866
Teron, Manny, Herbie.

34:37.014 --> 34:38.635
Man, all them
Terrace niggas.

34:38.783 --> 34:40.503
They can't whoop on
Dukie like that.

34:40.650 --> 34:42.972
Yeah, I know. Only we can
whoop on Dukie like that.

34:43.120 --> 34:44.940
We've got to step it up,
even this out.

34:45.089 --> 34:47.376
Nah. Fuck even.

34:47.523 --> 34:49.344
We gonna hurt them
twice as bad.

34:49.493 --> 34:51.614
Give 'em a whoop-ass
they ain't gonna never forget.

34:51.762 --> 34:53.315
If we straight-up fight them,

34:53.464 --> 34:56.650
there's as many of them
as there is us-- more even.

34:56.799 --> 34:58.519
So what you saying?
You scared?

34:58.667 --> 34:59.653
Nah, I'm just saying.

34:59.802 --> 35:02.590
If we're gonna hurt them,
we need to think on it.

35:02.739 --> 35:04.758
Do something go past
beating on each other.

35:04.906 --> 35:07.093
You talking guns and shit.

35:07.242 --> 35:09.072
Nah, I ain't talking guns.

35:13.447 --> 35:14.902
What?

35:15.049 --> 35:16.636
Aw, shit.

35:16.784 --> 35:18.648
Randy got an idea.

35:21.020 --> 35:22.841
Hey, Norman.

35:22.990 --> 35:24.978
You know what I had
for dinner last night?

35:25.125 --> 35:27.012
Tuna sub.
I ate in the car.

35:27.160 --> 35:28.846
When I'm finished
writing my memoirs,

35:28.995 --> 35:30.449
that shit'll be in there,
no doubt.

35:30.597 --> 35:32.750
You see what I just ate?
In the car?

35:32.898 --> 35:34.620
A fucking tuna sub.

35:34.768 --> 35:36.854
In order to prevent distemper,
Norman,

35:37.003 --> 35:38.789
you must vary
the candidate's menu.

35:38.937 --> 35:40.191
If you're done chewing,

35:40.339 --> 35:42.898
Iet's give these new
radio spots a listen.

35:46.078 --> 35:48.432
We've seen what Tommy Carcetti
can do at City Hall

35:48.579 --> 35:50.800
as a councilman.

35:50.948 --> 35:52.636
While the current administration
bent to special interests,

35:52.784 --> 35:54.137
Tommy Carcetti
sponsored legislation...

35:54.285 --> 35:56.906
- What?
-...that is protecting jobs at the fort

35:57.054 --> 35:59.242
by preventing the overdevelopment
of our waterfront.

35:59.389 --> 36:01.645
300,000. Great.

36:01.792 --> 36:02.884
Thanks for sharing.

36:04.727 --> 36:07.448
...that prevented budget cuts
to vital city services...

36:07.596 --> 36:09.652
Three and five zeroes--
mayor's latest TV buy,

36:09.800 --> 36:11.286
and it's four weeks out.

36:11.434 --> 36:13.755
- Turn that shit off!
- You don't like the spots?

36:13.903 --> 36:16.424
I read the copy before the studio mix.
I think they're strong.

36:16.572 --> 36:18.393
They're bullshit!
Weak bullshit!

36:18.540 --> 36:20.261
I wouldn't vote for me.

36:20.409 --> 36:22.196
Fuck!

36:22.344 --> 36:24.064
Fuck Royce!
Fuck Tony Gray!

36:24.212 --> 36:26.043
Fuck me!

36:28.550 --> 36:29.935
Where am I going again?

36:30.083 --> 36:32.071
One of those neighborhoods
between Oliver and Middle East.

36:32.219 --> 36:35.409
Middle East. Now, that's
a good name for it-- fucking Fallujah.

36:35.556 --> 36:38.109
Command performance.
Ms. Victorina Simmons.

36:38.258 --> 36:40.179
She holds sway over
two big vote precincts,

36:40.326 --> 36:42.148
no matter who the EDC
is lying down with--

36:42.296 --> 36:45.583
Fucking Royce!
300,000 like it's fucking water.

36:45.731 --> 36:47.585
Then there's also
the Reverend Garnett.

36:47.733 --> 36:49.454
What are they complaining
about today?

36:49.602 --> 36:51.656
Fucking shithole of a city.
Whining bastards,

36:51.804 --> 36:55.359
bitching about the trash
or the crime or this or that.

36:55.508 --> 36:57.429
It's my fucking fault
it went to shit.

36:57.576 --> 36:58.696
These motherfuckers.

36:58.844 --> 37:01.641
- Boss.
- They can bite my bloody ass.

37:06.951 --> 37:08.214
Ms. Simmons.

37:09.687 --> 37:11.873
Reverend Garnett.
Good to see you again.

37:12.022 --> 37:13.375
I had a meeting going on,

37:13.524 --> 37:15.777
but I'm here now, and I know
there's things to see.

37:15.925 --> 37:17.646
We called
and called downtown,

37:17.795 --> 37:19.449
and ain't nothing gets done.

37:19.597 --> 37:20.615
Okay. Show me.

37:20.764 --> 37:22.250
Right this way,
Councilman.

37:22.398 --> 37:24.160
The first thing I want you
to take a look at...

37:29.539 --> 37:31.092
See, you've got to drink a lot.

37:31.240 --> 37:32.927
Think about
the water running.

37:33.075 --> 37:34.428
And that way,
you know--

37:34.576 --> 37:36.896
How the fuck you know what
water running be like, Duke?

37:37.045 --> 37:39.536
Water been off in your house
since last year.

37:41.049 --> 37:43.069
- Man, that's cold.
- Yeah, that's cold, Nay.

37:43.217 --> 37:44.912
Oh, shit.
I'm ready.

38:05.371 --> 38:07.862
Can't go with
niggers watching, yo.

38:11.976 --> 38:13.698
When we call,

38:13.846 --> 38:16.267
he'll send somebody,
most of the time,

38:16.414 --> 38:19.770
and they write it all down
just like he doing now.

38:19.918 --> 38:22.439
But nothing ever gets done.

38:22.587 --> 38:25.308
Come here, Councilman,
I want you to see this.

38:25.456 --> 38:27.143
Now, see them drug boys?

38:27.292 --> 38:28.945
They block
the alleys like this

38:29.092 --> 38:30.613
so the police won't
chase them down there.

38:30.760 --> 38:32.248
- All this trash.
- Mm-hmm.

38:32.396 --> 38:34.450
Rats everywhere.
Houses vacant.

38:34.597 --> 38:37.820
We keep trying to get them
down here and clean this up.

38:37.967 --> 38:40.488
I guess that's
too much like right.

38:40.636 --> 38:43.857
Well, truth is,
Royce won't let the city agencies

38:44.005 --> 38:46.303
take any of
my constituent calls.

38:49.444 --> 38:51.098
But let me see
what I can do.

38:51.246 --> 38:54.010
Come on, let me show you this
down here. Come on.

39:03.357 --> 39:04.483
Yo.

39:06.427 --> 39:08.880
Y'all Terrace niggas know that boy
who go by the name "Deez"?

39:09.028 --> 39:11.050
- Deez?
- Yeah, Deez nuts.

39:11.198 --> 39:13.291
- Aw, fuck.
- Shit.

39:19.138 --> 39:22.060
Yo yo, come on,
come on, come on.

39:22.208 --> 39:23.936
Yeah, come on, get him!

39:43.860 --> 39:45.815
Damn! I knew those bitches
was gonna set us up.

39:45.963 --> 39:47.883
Yeah, fucking say it, bitches.

39:48.031 --> 39:49.828
Don't ever disrespect Terrace.

39:51.767 --> 39:52.754
Damn!

39:52.902 --> 39:55.462
- I fucking pissed myself.
- Fuck!

40:02.177 --> 40:03.576
Over here!

40:08.049 --> 40:09.415
Kick him right behind.

40:13.254 --> 40:14.515
Randy!

40:20.395 --> 40:21.418
This way.

40:23.997 --> 40:25.794
Hey yo,
he went in there!

40:32.972 --> 40:35.593
Remember that phrasing
is a cornerstone

40:35.741 --> 40:37.996
in communicating
with your students.

40:38.144 --> 40:41.132
This applies not only
to the questions you ask

40:41.280 --> 40:43.467
or their comprehension
of the lesson,

40:43.616 --> 40:46.904
but how they perceive
you as an educator.

40:47.052 --> 40:48.572
And where does that begin?

40:48.720 --> 40:51.841
Out loud
and enthusiastically.

40:51.989 --> 40:56.445
I.A.L.A.C.

40:56.594 --> 40:59.882
Let's go.
Once again.

41:00.029 --> 41:04.554
I.A.L.A.C.

41:04.702 --> 41:07.256
And what are we
telling ourselves?

41:07.404 --> 41:12.159
I am lovable and capable.

41:12.307 --> 41:14.528
Now I see
those smiling faces.

41:14.676 --> 41:17.231
...where the listing
on the lower half of the page

41:17.380 --> 41:20.568
indicates some typical
soft-target locations.

41:20.716 --> 41:24.237
An officer alert to the terrorist threat
must ask himself,

41:24.386 --> 41:26.774
"Do I know the location
of my soft targets,

41:26.922 --> 41:30.944
those where large numbers
of civilians congregate?"

41:31.092 --> 41:35.948
--Train terminals,
office buildings, stadiums.

41:36.096 --> 41:39.619
Another hot zone in the classroom
is the pencil sharpener,

41:39.767 --> 41:41.754
where children tend
to congregate and--

41:41.902 --> 41:44.423
I had a pencil sharpener
in my class once.

41:44.570 --> 41:48.092
Antoine Granderson ripped it
from the wall and threw it at me.

41:48.240 --> 41:50.329
I'd like to know what
your lesson plan suggests

41:50.477 --> 41:52.764
when Harold Hounchell sends
a full set of textbooks

41:52.912 --> 41:55.903
through a closed window.
Thank you.

42:00.218 --> 42:02.873
Settle down, everybody.

42:03.020 --> 42:05.075
And for emergency procedures

42:05.223 --> 42:07.844
in the event of
biochemical agents,

42:07.992 --> 42:10.245
you can refer
to Appendix B.

42:10.394 --> 42:12.247
No disrespect
to your appendix,

42:12.396 --> 42:14.551
but if them terrorists
do fuck up the Western,

42:14.699 --> 42:17.252
could anybody even tell?

42:17.400 --> 42:19.355
Some Al-Qaedas were up
on Baltimore Street

42:19.503 --> 42:21.356
planning on blowing up
the chicken joint.

42:21.504 --> 42:23.525
But Apex's crew jacked them up,
took their camels and robes,

42:23.673 --> 42:24.726
buried their ass
in Leakin Park.

42:24.874 --> 42:26.661
At least
that's what I heard.

42:26.809 --> 42:29.972
Hey, y'all want some real terrorists?
You go up on Pencey and Gold.

42:32.313 --> 42:34.372
Hey, guys,
let's maintain our--

42:36.051 --> 42:37.671
You're doing
one heck of a job.

42:37.819 --> 42:40.173
Not another fucking word.

42:40.321 --> 42:43.310
Thank you.

42:43.458 --> 42:45.745
Ahem. So...

42:45.894 --> 42:47.191
Mmm.

42:48.429 --> 42:49.615
You beast.

42:49.763 --> 42:52.785
I can't help it.
You stirred my manhood.

42:52.933 --> 42:54.587
Little Boy Blue.

42:54.735 --> 42:56.521
What the fuck
are you doing here?

42:56.669 --> 42:57.823
I caught one.

42:57.971 --> 43:00.925
Got a street dealer
who goes by the name of Lex.

43:01.073 --> 43:02.294
Lester heard it
on the wire.

43:02.441 --> 43:03.928
Lester's up on the wire?

43:04.076 --> 43:06.463
Shit, boy, you are
out of the loop.

43:06.611 --> 43:08.633
You know this mutt?
Goes by Lex?

43:08.781 --> 43:10.934
He is familiar.

43:11.082 --> 43:14.304
You know who
you should ask? Carver.

43:14.452 --> 43:17.774
- Naw...
- He'd love the job, man.

43:17.923 --> 43:20.411
All right.
Carver it is.

43:20.559 --> 43:22.346
I still feel the need
to pull your coat.

43:22.494 --> 43:26.349
- For what?
- The taste, Jimmy. The taste.

43:26.497 --> 43:29.619
How about you and me hit
a few of our favorite spots?

43:29.766 --> 43:32.588
You know, me on the Glenlivet,
you on the Jamey?

43:32.736 --> 43:34.624
Go see if that train
is still on the track.

43:34.771 --> 43:37.225
Why don't you come round
some night for dinner?

43:37.373 --> 43:40.528
Say hey to Beadie
and the ankle-biters.

43:40.677 --> 43:41.836
Dinner?

43:42.946 --> 43:44.999
...Iocated
in high-rise structures,

43:45.147 --> 43:47.069
as well as residences

43:47.216 --> 43:49.035
are detailed alongside...

43:49.184 --> 43:50.412
Thanks, Santy.

43:52.221 --> 43:54.508
This horseshit?
You serious?

43:54.655 --> 43:56.748
Back to school
for the kids.

44:07.034 --> 44:09.421
Hey. Yo, Namond,
I'll pay you back.

44:09.569 --> 44:11.196
You ain't never
gonna have no money.

44:15.175 --> 44:16.627
Yo, Michael,
they got you?

44:16.775 --> 44:18.063
Ain't nothing
but a scuffle, man.

44:18.211 --> 44:19.964
Everybody made it back,
though, right?

44:20.112 --> 44:22.934
Naw, man, he had to the boss
to get some stitches.

44:23.082 --> 44:24.202
He got hit with a brick.

44:24.349 --> 44:25.636
I see you changed
clothes already.

44:25.783 --> 44:27.471
He had to.
Yo, he was stinking.

44:27.619 --> 44:30.608
Yo, Randy, man, that was
the stupidest thing you ever thought of.

44:30.756 --> 44:32.844
But it was kind of funny
when it happened, though.

44:32.991 --> 44:34.618
You know what I'm saying?

44:37.861 --> 44:40.350
Yo, you want something
before he bounce?

44:40.498 --> 44:41.918
I'm buying.

44:42.066 --> 44:43.819
One for every soldier
that stood tall.

44:43.968 --> 44:46.594
- I was down there.
- Yeah, fuck you, Duke.

44:57.646 --> 44:59.066
So you get out
all right?

44:59.215 --> 45:02.002
Yeah. Hurt my ankle going
around the corner, but--

45:02.150 --> 45:03.550
But you got away, then?

45:11.459 --> 45:13.513
The lieutenant governor
is up in arms

45:13.661 --> 45:16.116
because two Democratic
National Committees...

45:16.264 --> 45:17.216
I know we're way late--

45:17.364 --> 45:19.352
Ain't no thing.
You did good here.

45:19.500 --> 45:21.626
Turn that bullshit off.

45:31.544 --> 45:33.964
You really think they're gonna
vote for the white guy?

45:34.112 --> 45:36.200
Black folk been voting white
for a long time.

45:36.348 --> 45:38.904
You come correct,
we listen.

45:39.052 --> 45:41.539
It's y'all that don't ever
vote black.

45:41.687 --> 45:43.621
Shit, you got
my vote, anyway.

45:45.290 --> 45:47.780
I don't have your vote,
Norman?

45:50.428 --> 45:52.048
You're my deputy
campaign manager,

45:52.196 --> 45:53.516
and I don't have your vote?

45:53.664 --> 45:57.085
Last white man I could vote
for was Bobby Kennedy,

45:57.234 --> 46:00.088
and you ain't no Bobby K.

46:00.237 --> 46:01.658
I thought you just said--

46:01.806 --> 46:04.760
I was speaking in general about
the kindly nature of black folks.

46:04.908 --> 46:07.696
In particular,
I ain't all that kindly.

46:07.843 --> 46:09.897
So you're gonna take
my fucking check

46:10.045 --> 46:11.733
and run with
my fucking campaign--

46:11.881 --> 46:13.601
Well, I do know
who pays me.

46:13.750 --> 46:16.003
Yes, sir!
Oh yes, sir, boss!

46:16.151 --> 46:20.073
Who are you gonna vote for?
Royce? Tony Gray?

46:20.222 --> 46:23.680
One of them brothers.

46:26.594 --> 46:28.391
Yeah yeah yeah.

46:38.205 --> 46:39.892
Don't make me
tell you again.

46:40.040 --> 46:41.694
It's 9:00 sharp, boy.

46:41.842 --> 46:44.629
And I'm smelling
what has to be urine.

46:44.778 --> 46:47.332
What you been at, boy?

46:47.480 --> 46:50.969
Well, we were playing
with Dukie today.

46:51.117 --> 46:53.471
You know how he be
with his clothes and all.

46:53.618 --> 46:57.141
Well, it's good that child
has friends, I suppose.

46:57.289 --> 46:59.813
- Yes, ma'am.
- Get in there.

47:01.993 --> 47:03.546
Come on, now,
give me a break--

47:03.694 --> 47:04.948
Come on, Dougie.
I know it's late,

47:05.095 --> 47:06.549
but I got to come
backdoor like this,

47:06.697 --> 47:07.818
or the agencies
won't do shit.

47:07.965 --> 47:09.219
You know that
as well as I do.

47:09.367 --> 47:10.353
Come on, Tommy...

47:10.502 --> 47:12.588
Come on, Tommy.
Hustle.

47:12.736 --> 47:14.056
This is ridiculous.
Come on, give me a break--

47:14.203 --> 47:15.523
Look, Dougie. Yeah.

47:15.671 --> 47:17.660
I'm sorry to bug you at home,
but this asshole Royce

47:17.807 --> 47:19.395
won't handle a thing
out of my office,

47:19.543 --> 47:21.163
and I need a couple
of alleys cleaned.

47:21.311 --> 47:23.999
Yeah. 1200 block of
Federal Street, both sides;

47:24.147 --> 47:25.700
and then Chester
and Collington

47:25.848 --> 47:28.469
- run in either direction off that.
- Jesus, Tommy.

47:28.617 --> 47:30.472
I know, you're gonna be out
there again in a couple days.

47:30.620 --> 47:31.539
Can you call Frankie
in Special Services

47:31.686 --> 47:32.941
and have him send
a cold patch truck?

47:33.089 --> 47:34.608
Federal street's
a fucking tank trap.

47:34.757 --> 47:35.643
Yeah yeah yeah.

47:35.791 --> 47:37.610
Great. Thanks.
Love to Denise.

47:37.759 --> 47:39.713
Hustle up, Tom.

47:39.860 --> 47:41.314
How you doing?
Good evening.

47:41.462 --> 47:42.483
Hi.

47:42.631 --> 47:44.284
You're over
two hours late, Tommy.

47:44.432 --> 47:46.986
You ain't gonna win
disrespecting your base.

47:47.134 --> 47:48.464
Hold up, Tony.

47:49.770 --> 47:51.490
Look, man.
We got to talk.

47:51.638 --> 47:52.992
I feel the bad about the way
things have turned out,

47:53.140 --> 47:54.727
but right or wrong,
if you're elected,

47:54.875 --> 47:56.762
then I'm gonna do whatever
I can to help you,

47:56.910 --> 47:59.665
and if I get in,
I'm gonna need your help.

47:59.813 --> 48:02.967
I mean, it's not
personal, Tony.

48:03.115 --> 48:05.084
Fuck you, Tommy.

48:40.650 --> 48:42.310
So this is me?

48:43.486 --> 48:45.477
This is you.

48:59.466 --> 49:02.022
Pandemic!

49:02.170 --> 49:04.160
Pandemic! Got that
pandemic right here!

49:10.310 --> 49:11.663
- What's up?
- What's up, man?

49:11.812 --> 49:14.200
I got all this from the Koreans
today at a discount.

49:14.348 --> 49:16.868
When school start, I'll be selling it
for three times that.

49:17.016 --> 49:18.770
Tell you what,

49:18.918 --> 49:20.510
Iet me get them Skittles.

49:29.528 --> 49:31.315
Naw. Do me a favor
for the rest.

49:31.462 --> 49:32.849
Go up the block
and tell Lex

49:32.997 --> 49:34.685
there's a girl
that want to see him

49:34.832 --> 49:36.419
- at the playground behind Fort.
- Girl?

49:36.568 --> 49:39.555
Tell him Patrice say he should come
to the playground after 8:00.

49:39.703 --> 49:40.823
Why don't you
tell him yourself?

49:40.971 --> 49:42.525
Look, dog,
I don't want to be taking

49:42.673 --> 49:44.761
none of Bodie's shit today
about cutting work.

49:44.908 --> 49:46.877
All right?
Just do me that favor.

49:47.878 --> 49:49.699
Pandemic!

49:49.847 --> 49:52.134
Pandemic right here!

49:52.282 --> 49:55.369
For a skinny motherfucker,
he sure do sweat some.

49:55.517 --> 49:57.038
We got to keep
an extra change in the car

49:57.186 --> 49:59.407
so we don't have to come home
in the middle of the day.

49:59.555 --> 50:01.887
Well, we're way past
late now, so...

50:05.060 --> 50:07.186
- Damn it!
- Here, let me.

50:08.429 --> 50:10.151
Hey, Norman.

50:10.298 --> 50:12.852
Maybe I'll go to clip-on
for a while.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.888
Hey, Terri got in
new polling data.

50:15.036 --> 50:16.655
Did you get a bump?

50:16.803 --> 50:18.791
She won't show me anything
till it's all broke down,

50:18.939 --> 50:21.271
but, yeah, I deserve
a bump, don't l?

50:28.815 --> 50:30.441
Four more weeks, Jen.

50:39.358 --> 50:42.746
Quality time
with the wife and kids.

50:42.894 --> 50:44.382
That's what,
four minutes?

50:44.529 --> 50:46.317
More like six.

50:46.464 --> 50:47.884
Six.

50:48.032 --> 50:49.659
Shit, I could have got laid.

51:17.627 --> 51:19.247
Yo. Yo, Chris, l--
I didn't--

51:19.395 --> 51:21.863
Yeah. It's good.

51:30.272 --> 51:32.292
Pandemic!

51:32.439 --> 51:34.127
Pandemic right here!

51:34.275 --> 51:37.029
No Lex.
Where's that skinny mope?

51:37.177 --> 51:38.597
He was here earlier.

51:38.745 --> 51:39.931
Well, fuck it.
We'll come back,

51:40.079 --> 51:41.734
Jack him tomorrow,
no problem.

51:41.882 --> 51:43.007
All right.

51:56.962 --> 51:58.725
Share the sodas, too.

52:04.202 --> 52:06.032
- What's up? What's up?
- Hey.

52:08.973 --> 52:10.659
What's up?

52:10.807 --> 52:12.461
Let me holla at you
real quick.

52:12.610 --> 52:13.837
What up?

52:15.212 --> 52:17.767
- You did like I said?
- Yeah.

52:17.915 --> 52:19.401
Yeah, you must have,

52:19.549 --> 52:20.968
because the nigga
went up the block.

52:21.117 --> 52:22.737
He ain't never
coming back down.

52:22.886 --> 52:26.474
Chris and Snoop-- pow!

52:26.623 --> 52:27.509
What?

52:27.657 --> 52:31.786
Look. Just be cool,
all right?

52:35.463 --> 52:37.151
Our heroes
back from the wars.

52:37.299 --> 52:39.020
Those poll numbers
tallied up yet?

52:39.168 --> 52:40.654
Not too bad, either.

52:40.802 --> 52:43.790
Royce, 35;
you, 26; Gray, 20.

52:43.938 --> 52:46.125
19% undecided.

52:46.273 --> 52:49.196
We're fucked if we haven't moved
any more than that. I need to be at 30,

52:49.343 --> 52:51.497
and I need Tony taking
25 of his points.

52:51.646 --> 52:53.266
Royce's negatives
are way up.

52:53.413 --> 52:56.701
Like what, 34% unfavorable
to 43% favorable?

52:56.849 --> 52:57.735
He's vulnerable.

52:57.884 --> 52:59.637
Geri, understand this.

52:59.785 --> 53:01.407
In order to win,
I need Tony Gray

53:01.554 --> 53:03.809
to take a huge bite
out of Royce's lead-- huge.

53:03.956 --> 53:05.210
Tony's moved, what?

53:05.358 --> 53:06.911
Two points
in the last month?

53:07.058 --> 53:10.414
That poll says one in five voters
hasn't decided anything yet.

53:10.562 --> 53:13.684
Yeah. The first batch of radio spots
worked magic, didn't they?

53:13.832 --> 53:15.419
How much money
we piss away on those?

53:15.567 --> 53:18.188
Look at these First District figures.
I mean, that's my base,

53:18.335 --> 53:21.657
and I'm polling 37%
with 24% undecided?

53:21.805 --> 53:23.026
Fuck me! I'm done!

53:23.174 --> 53:24.861
Tommy, nobody's focused
on this race yet.

53:25.009 --> 53:26.195
We're gonna own
the First.

53:26.343 --> 53:27.997
Christ, look at what Royce
is polling in the Fourth.

53:28.145 --> 53:30.633
No doubt, Tony's got to get
some traction in West Baltimore.

53:30.780 --> 53:33.001
Yeah, he needs
to be rounding 25%

53:33.150 --> 53:35.871
and headed for 30.
And, by the way,

53:36.019 --> 53:39.674
who can tell me when the fuck did
the Sixth District become 64% black?

53:39.822 --> 53:42.143
About five years ago
in the last redistricting,

53:42.290 --> 53:43.177
mostly as I recall,

53:43.325 --> 53:44.645
to give your ass
more white votes

53:44.793 --> 53:46.523
over there in the First.

53:48.130 --> 53:49.750
What the fuck
was I thinking?

53:49.899 --> 53:52.620
A hell of a lot can happen
between now and election day.

53:52.768 --> 53:55.201
I've been ahead further
than Royce is and lost.

53:59.207 --> 54:01.175
I can't win this.

54:02.910 --> 54:05.264
Tommy, where the fuck
you going?

54:05.413 --> 54:07.380
I'm your ride home, man.

54:13.486 --> 54:15.783
The man can
read a poll.

55:25.918 --> 55:28.174
You been drinking?

55:28.322 --> 55:29.675
I'm fine.

55:29.823 --> 55:32.510
Well, you need to be fine
somewhere else.

55:32.658 --> 55:34.044
Park curfew
is midnight.

55:34.193 --> 55:35.613
City's averaging
a murder a day,

55:35.761 --> 55:39.117
and here you are with
Rec and Park rules?

55:39.265 --> 55:40.452
What are you,
a smart ass?

55:40.600 --> 55:43.727
Sorry.
I didn't mean nothing.

55:47.539 --> 55:50.193
Don't I know you?

55:50.341 --> 55:53.397
I'm running for mayor.

55:53.545 --> 55:56.866
Tommy Carcetti,
First District.

55:57.014 --> 55:59.602
I'll be coming back through
in about 20, Councilman.

55:59.750 --> 56:02.184
Do me a favor
and take it down the road.

57:02.640 --> 57:04.194
Randy?

57:04.342 --> 57:06.138
Yes, ma'am.

57:07.305 --> 57:13.489
