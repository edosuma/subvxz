00:46.934 --> 00:50.267
Tell me if you feel anything at all.

00:50.304 --> 00:52.329
- Here?
- No.

00:53.808 --> 00:56.174
- How about there?
- No.

00:57.211 --> 00:59.441
Here?

00:59.480 --> 01:00.742
No.

01:01.783 --> 01:04.047
I think we ought to lose a little weight.

01:05.653 --> 01:08.019
Why do doctors always say ''we''?

01:08.056 --> 01:10.047
As if it were your pain?

01:11.993 --> 01:13.984
No.

01:14.028 --> 01:16.462
How about here?

01:16.497 --> 01:18.522
That's it. My appendix side.

01:18.566 --> 01:20.864
You shouldn't read
those medical journals.

01:20.902 --> 01:23.370
It's probably the worry
that's hurting you.

01:23.404 --> 01:27.238
You thought you had a brain tumor once
and it was your bowler hat.

01:27.708 --> 01:30.609
- This does hurt.
- Yes.

01:32.080 --> 01:36.141
I think perhaps it's a good idea
if we got you in for a few tests.

01:36.184 --> 01:39.210
Tests? There's something critical?

01:39.253 --> 01:41.778
There's nothing critical.

01:42.623 --> 01:45.183
There's no question of that.

01:45.226 --> 01:47.751
It's just in case there is colitis.

01:47.795 --> 01:49.854
You are hiding something from me.

01:49.897 --> 01:54.061
I'm not hiding anything from you.
This may be nothing at all.

01:55.736 --> 02:00.070
Give me a moment, will you?
I've got to be sure, OK?

02:00.108 --> 02:02.975
Sorry. No, I can't. I'm with a patient.

02:03.644 --> 02:07.045
- Do you want me to leave?
- No, of course not.

02:08.082 --> 02:10.482
Can I ring you back?

02:10.518 --> 02:13.078
It shouldn't be long but I can't now.

02:14.355 --> 02:16.448
Just try and stay in for a few moments.

02:17.258 --> 02:19.658
Can't you stay there for a few moments?

02:19.694 --> 02:22.288
- I'm in a terrible hurry.
- Right.

02:23.231 --> 02:26.826
- Can we arrange tests for next week?
- I can't next week.

02:26.868 --> 02:30.201
- I've got to go to Brussels.
- The week after, then.

02:30.238 --> 02:32.229
I think I'm going to Frankfurt.

02:32.273 --> 02:35.436
Which is more important -
the pain or Frankfurt?

02:35.476 --> 02:38.968
I'd rather you told me now, at this stage.
I mean...

02:43.451 --> 02:45.681
Listen, old friend.

02:45.720 --> 02:47.711
It's not cancer.

02:48.322 --> 02:51.291
- How do you know?
- Because I'm telling you.

02:52.326 --> 02:55.818
My secretary will be
in touch with you on Monday.

03:23.057 --> 03:25.048
Pool Hotel?

03:27.195 --> 03:29.322
Message desk.

03:30.364 --> 03:32.992
- What was the name?
- Dr. Daniel Hirsh.

03:33.034 --> 03:37.164
- Oh! Dr. Hearsh!
- What were those calls?

03:37.205 --> 03:39.196
Just a minute.

03:39.240 --> 03:41.231
There was a call from Dr. Simon,

03:41.275 --> 03:45.371
a call from Mrs. Burke, you have
the number, and one from Mr. Elgin.

03:45.413 --> 03:48.211
Did Mr. Elkin say how long he'd be in?

03:48.249 --> 03:50.240
He was going straight out.

03:50.284 --> 03:53.219
He must have changed his mind.
He's in. It's engaged.

03:53.254 --> 03:56.246
It might be someone else ringing him.

03:56.290 --> 03:58.485
I know, but he needs to talk to me

03:58.526 --> 04:01.051
before he goes away for the weekend.

04:01.095 --> 04:03.086
Oh, never mind.

04:03.130 --> 04:07.226
In future, try and get his name
roughly right. It adds a personal touch.

04:07.268 --> 04:11.602
It's Elkin, not Elgin or Alvin
or Alcott or Higgins.

04:11.639 --> 04:13.903
You've been taking it long enough.

04:13.941 --> 04:15.932
Will you be picking up now?

04:15.977 --> 04:19.310
No, I'm going out. Thank you. Goodbye.

05:30.951 --> 05:32.942
Christ.

05:46.067 --> 05:47.830
- Hello?
- Answering service?

05:47.868 --> 05:51.702
I'm late. This is Alex Greville.
What's the time? My watch stopped.

05:51.739 --> 05:54.173
- It's five to six.
- Oh, no.

05:54.208 --> 05:57.974
If Mr. Elkin should ring,
tell him I'm on my way

05:58.012 --> 06:00.981
but I had to booze with a client
who's had the push.

06:01.015 --> 06:03.848
I tried to ring him but he must have left.

06:03.884 --> 06:06.546
- Is the traffic bad?
- It's always bad here.

06:06.587 --> 06:08.953
It would be different round you.

06:08.989 --> 06:11.583
Worse, of course, like your weather. Bye.

06:18.032 --> 06:20.023
Sod it!

06:48.229 --> 06:50.857
- It's not there at all.
- Babstock Passage.

06:50.898 --> 06:53.731
- It's probably upstairs anyway.
- Excuse me.

06:53.768 --> 06:58.000
- Is there a hat shop in here?
- I'm sorry, I don't know. I'm in a hurry.

06:58.038 --> 06:59.869
I thought there was, dear.

07:05.946 --> 07:10.406
Now, with the time exactly on
the half-hour, let's go to the news room.

07:10.451 --> 07:15.047
With Britain in the throes of its most
serious economic crisis since the war,

07:15.089 --> 07:18.889
the cabinet will be in
continuous session over the weekend.

07:18.926 --> 07:20.826
So will trade union leaders

07:20.861 --> 07:23.352
faced with the threat
of mass unemployment

07:23.397 --> 07:25.922
and militant unofficial strike action.

07:25.966 --> 07:28.457
The sharp increase in the bank rate

07:28.502 --> 07:31.300
and the tough new restrictions
on bank loans

07:31.338 --> 07:35.638
were attacked today by the TUC,
who said that hundreds...

07:38.245 --> 07:40.577
Let me come alone.
I can look after the kids.

07:40.614 --> 07:43.811
Alex, bring Bob.
It'll be good for you both.

07:43.851 --> 07:46.445
- Trust me.
- Alva, Alva...

07:46.487 --> 07:49.456
..the duty on a wide range of products.

07:49.490 --> 07:51.651
One car manufacturer said...

08:09.543 --> 08:12.034
283 0811. Hello?

08:12.079 --> 08:14.707
Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello!

08:14.748 --> 08:18.149
Darling, are you stuck somewhere?
What's the matter?

08:18.185 --> 08:21.985
I shouldn't have said yes
to this weekend. Can Bob hear you?

08:22.022 --> 08:24.923
I shouldn't think so,
with all this going on!

08:24.959 --> 08:27.519
Timothy, you've started John Stuart off.

08:27.962 --> 08:31.295
It will go fine. Look, talk to Bob.

08:31.332 --> 08:34.301
No, I don't want to talk to him.

08:34.335 --> 08:37.998
I'm sorry I've held you up.
I was going to put the kids to bed.

08:38.038 --> 08:41.974
They always go to bed at this time.
You'll have a lie-in.

08:42.009 --> 08:44.135
Mummy says it's nice for them

08:44.178 --> 08:47.170
if they put us to bed together.
Bob and Alex.

08:47.214 --> 08:51.048
Alex, don't worry, darling. Trust me.

08:52.219 --> 08:55.746
Lucy, don't forget to turn
the shepherd's pie down.

08:55.789 --> 08:57.780
Have you got the other one?

08:57.825 --> 08:59.315
Alva.

08:59.360 --> 09:01.658
I'm so sorry.

09:02.696 --> 09:04.755
The traffic!

09:07.101 --> 09:09.661
- I'm so sorry.
- It really doesn't matter.

09:09.703 --> 09:11.728
You won't be there till midnight.

09:11.772 --> 09:13.706
It's better to be there late.

09:14.675 --> 09:18.668
- You know Professor Johns.
- How do you do? I'm terribly sorry.

09:19.747 --> 09:22.841
- And how are you?
- Two bleeding hours late, miss.

09:22.883 --> 09:24.282
Don't.

09:25.586 --> 09:27.417
He recognizes you!

09:27.454 --> 09:31.322
Lucy, tell CarI not to eat
all the monkey's bananas.

09:31.358 --> 09:33.826
Bye, the late Miss Greville.

09:35.195 --> 09:38.062
- Papa made a joke!
- What?

09:38.098 --> 09:40.760
Papa made a joke!

09:40.801 --> 09:43.929
He said to Alex,
''the late Miss Greville.''

09:44.972 --> 09:48.032
- She is terrifically late.
- No, darling...

09:48.075 --> 09:51.010
You're never late. What happened?

09:51.045 --> 09:54.947
- Just couldn't get going.
- You know he's eaten already.

09:54.982 --> 09:57.348
- What?
- He only has one meal a day.

09:57.384 --> 10:00.012
Two pounds raw tomorrow.
I think I've got it.

10:00.054 --> 10:03.319
Don't let the economic crisis
spoil your weekend.

10:03.357 --> 10:06.258
It is worrying about
the cost of living index.

10:06.293 --> 10:09.729
- Go away!
- Be a good family. Bye!

10:10.764 --> 10:12.493
Bye.

10:15.135 --> 10:19.196
Have a good time!
Enjoy yourselves! Bye!

10:19.239 --> 10:21.070
Come on, dog.

10:22.076 --> 10:25.739
Daniel Hirsh wouldn't just turn up
this weekend, would he?

10:25.779 --> 10:27.770
He knows we're away.

10:28.916 --> 10:34.252
I never minded any of the sacrifices
God required of me...

10:34.288 --> 10:35.949
Except one.

10:35.990 --> 10:39.255
I was terrified he'd make me
give up football.

10:41.528 --> 10:43.189
Come here.

10:43.230 --> 10:45.721
When you incur a penalty...

10:47.234 --> 10:49.464
What have you got that on for?

10:50.504 --> 10:53.200
- I don't know.
- Well, take it off.

10:54.108 --> 10:56.099
It's this house.

10:56.143 --> 10:59.806
And this room! It's so bloody freezing!

11:04.918 --> 11:06.909
You're like a little fire!

11:12.026 --> 11:14.051
I do love you.

11:15.863 --> 11:17.854
Well, thank you, sir.

11:33.881 --> 11:35.872
Good night.

11:59.373 --> 12:01.364
If you get up, I'll kill you.

12:04.178 --> 12:06.169
Yes, I'm just coming.

12:07.214 --> 12:11.014
It's me, Lucy, just to say
I'll look after John Stuart for you.

12:11.051 --> 12:14.111
She sounds like somebody's
mother-in-law, loitering.

12:14.154 --> 12:16.213
It's all right. I'll manage.

12:18.125 --> 12:22.357
Do you think Alva and Bill had that
disgusting octopus they gave to us?

12:22.396 --> 12:25.957
Perhaps they'll be sick in the middle
of the sociologists.

12:25.999 --> 12:28.229
- I want some milk.
- Oh, my God!

12:28.268 --> 12:30.634
You're getting more like an American.

12:30.671 --> 12:32.866
I want some wine.

12:34.575 --> 12:36.600
- What's this?
- I don't know.

12:36.643 --> 12:39.771
It looks special. I'll ask Lucy tomorrow.

12:39.813 --> 12:44.250
Oh, I love Alva.
Fancy having those posters in here.

12:44.284 --> 12:46.844
But Alva does that sort of thing.

12:47.888 --> 12:50.448
What she would really, really like

12:50.491 --> 12:53.016
is for us to get engaged in her bed.

12:53.060 --> 12:54.994
Oh, my God.

12:55.028 --> 12:58.088
She's like a CIA agent for happy families.

12:58.132 --> 13:00.327
And we're her guinea pigs.

13:00.367 --> 13:03.097
Oh, no, we're not.

13:03.137 --> 13:06.231
Are we? Oh, why did we come?

13:07.708 --> 13:09.699
Because you're soft.

13:10.644 --> 13:12.305
No.

13:12.346 --> 13:16.180
Because it's a chance
for a whole weekend together.

13:20.053 --> 13:23.648
You locked Kenyatta out
of your bedroom. He sleeps on your bed.

13:23.690 --> 13:27.057
- So sorry.
- I suppose you didn't mean to.

13:29.263 --> 13:33.165
- Is this milk all right for Bob to drink?
- It's Mummy's.

13:33.200 --> 13:37.102
- She wouldn't mind, would she?
- It's Mummy's milk for John Stuart.

13:37.137 --> 13:39.537
He isn't weaned yet.

13:41.909 --> 13:43.900
Oh, my God.

13:43.944 --> 13:45.935
Thank you very much.

13:52.653 --> 13:54.951
Shut up.

14:13.607 --> 14:16.098
Come on, then. There's a good boy.

14:18.045 --> 14:20.036
Come on, then. Come on.

16:34.748 --> 16:37.444
Serves you right
for pinching my breakfast.

16:37.484 --> 16:41.386
- Papa paid for it.
- There's socialism for you.

16:41.421 --> 16:43.048
What does he mean?

16:43.090 --> 16:45.991
Thank you so very much
for bringing up the tray.

16:46.026 --> 16:48.824
Mummy said you'd like a lie-in in peace.

16:48.862 --> 16:51.660
Did she mention you
bringing the tray and staying?

16:51.698 --> 16:54.132
We always come in here first thing.

16:54.167 --> 16:57.568
Then we watch Mama and Papa
have a bath together.

16:57.604 --> 16:59.196
Oh, my God.

17:01.141 --> 17:04.702
There's a most peculiar smell.
It's exactly like p...

17:08.147 --> 17:10.377
Are you children smoking pot?

17:10.416 --> 17:12.248
Are you bourgeois?

17:12.285 --> 17:14.515
I don't mind, but does Mummy know?

17:14.554 --> 17:17.887
They keep it behind the records
so we know where it is.

17:17.924 --> 17:20.722
Behind Tristan and Isolde.

17:23.597 --> 17:26.327
I suppose it doesn't matter.

18:18.752 --> 18:22.085
- What are you doing?
- Resigning.

18:22.122 --> 18:24.113
From my job at the office.

18:24.157 --> 18:26.091
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

18:27.094 --> 18:29.255
I should have done it ages ago.

18:34.935 --> 18:37.096
What will you do instead?

18:44.211 --> 18:46.338
It's not because of me, is it?

18:46.379 --> 18:49.280
No, my duck, it is not because of you.

18:49.316 --> 18:51.648
You turn everything to yourself.

19:00.227 --> 19:02.718
What shall we do with them today?

19:11.671 --> 19:13.161
What's wrong?

19:17.410 --> 19:19.401
Do you want to go out?

19:20.447 --> 19:22.677
Is it so difficult to say that to me?

19:23.250 --> 19:25.878
No.

19:25.919 --> 19:28.410
Just want to go into town for a bit.

19:30.590 --> 19:32.888
OK, fine.

19:32.926 --> 19:35.417
But you don't have to go to work.

19:37.230 --> 19:39.198
Oh, I see.

19:41.001 --> 19:43.435
Could it be...

19:43.470 --> 19:46.997
that you are going to see someone
whose name begins with D?

19:47.040 --> 19:50.669
- With D-A? Am I getting warm?
- Time's up.

19:52.879 --> 19:54.642
- Back soon.
- Give me a ring.

19:54.681 --> 19:56.672
Oh, no, you won't have time.

19:57.617 --> 19:59.608
Have fun with...

20:11.097 --> 20:14.430
One of the things is,
I can't stand the dirt he brings home.

20:18.205 --> 20:20.696
- I'm so sorry.
- Tell me...

20:20.740 --> 20:23.504
how long is it since you've led a...

20:23.543 --> 20:26.034
normal married life with him?

20:29.115 --> 20:31.481
How long is it?

20:31.518 --> 20:33.509
I can't complain.

20:34.554 --> 20:38.217
You mean he hasn't
been near you for a long time?

20:38.258 --> 20:43.389
- Or is it that you haven't wanted him to?
- He's never forced himself on me.

20:46.199 --> 20:48.531
Have you ever thought of living apart?

20:48.568 --> 20:51.560
I couldn't do that. It would kill him.

20:53.139 --> 20:56.165
Sometimes people survive better apart,

20:57.444 --> 21:00.242
even after a long time together.

21:00.280 --> 21:03.374
What do you know?
You're not married, are you?

21:03.416 --> 21:05.748
- No.
- Well, then.

21:08.788 --> 21:10.915
It's too late to start again.

21:10.957 --> 21:15.587
You see, it was never that sort of thing
between us.

21:15.629 --> 21:18.530
Not what you're saying.
Nothing physical.

21:18.565 --> 21:22.592
He just said when he proposed to me,
''Do you think we'd make a go of it?''

21:22.636 --> 21:26.595
I said, ''When you've got a house,''
and there it is.

21:27.641 --> 21:30.269
We've always been good to one another.

21:34.247 --> 21:36.715
Did I speak out of turn?

21:36.750 --> 21:38.513
Oh, no.

21:43.990 --> 21:46.618
Good of you to see me on a Saturday.

21:46.660 --> 21:50.994
A doctor's always busy, though.
Must be interesting seeing people.

21:51.031 --> 21:54.762
- I could do with a holiday.
- It's a calling, isn't it?

22:06.646 --> 22:09.137
- I'm so sorry.
- Hang on.

22:12.852 --> 22:15.685
- I'll see you next week.
- Thank you.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.025
I wish they wouldn't cry.

22:30.070 --> 22:32.402
I didn't expect you this weekend.

22:36.976 --> 22:40.412
- You're working on a Saturday.
- She said it was a calling.

22:40.447 --> 22:43.382
It always makes me want
to be a house painter.

22:43.416 --> 22:45.407
Are you all right?

22:58.865 --> 23:00.856
Christ, what a morning.

23:00.900 --> 23:03.596
I've had two nervous breakdowns,

23:03.636 --> 23:07.163
three cases of the pox,
an attack of German measles

23:07.207 --> 23:09.198
and quite frankly, I'm flaked.

23:17.951 --> 23:21.216
I always expect Saturday
to be the best day of the week.

23:22.288 --> 23:24.279
A lung.

23:31.131 --> 23:35.363
- So you finally bought it.
- Yes. Do you like it?

23:36.002 --> 23:39.267
Possessions, possessions...
It's getting to be a disease.

23:39.906 --> 23:42.875
They told me it would be an investment.

23:45.712 --> 23:49.546
- How's it bearing up?
- Fine. I had it on last night.

23:55.255 --> 23:57.815
I think it's the best thing I've done.

23:59.092 --> 24:01.083
Switch it off.

24:10.703 --> 24:12.830
It's a bit small, this.

24:14.774 --> 24:18.574
I'd like to build one on a vast scale,
really huge.

24:19.245 --> 24:21.975
Right. Could you switch it on,
and the light?

24:28.154 --> 24:32.488
- Do you think they'll like it in America?
- I think they'd lap it up.

24:32.525 --> 24:35.358
You sure they haven't
thought of it already?

24:35.395 --> 24:39.331
Someone seems interested.
Keep telephoning from New York.

24:41.634 --> 24:44.194
Does that mean you might have
to go there?

24:44.237 --> 24:47.400
Yeah, but if I went
it wouldn't be for long.

24:53.913 --> 24:55.437
Hello?

24:55.482 --> 24:57.814
Yes, I'm on the line answering.

24:59.185 --> 25:01.346
Oh, Mrs. Hackett.

25:01.387 --> 25:04.686
- Johnny's not getting better.
- He's taking the pills?

25:04.724 --> 25:09.024
- He doesn't like them.
- Yes, but didn't you...? Did you try to...?

25:09.062 --> 25:11.053
He's running a terrible fever.

25:11.097 --> 25:15.864
I gave you the pills to bring
the fever down. That's what they're for.

25:15.902 --> 25:18.097
He's got a very high temperature.

25:18.137 --> 25:21.072
Have you given him the pills
I prescribed?

25:21.107 --> 25:24.804
- Why don't you try that?
- I tried giving him a hot drink.

25:24.844 --> 25:28.871
- I don't think a hot drink...
- His throat has just closed up.

25:28.915 --> 25:32.908
I've tried painting it.
It doesn't seem to make any difference.

25:32.952 --> 25:37.855
Mrs. Hackett... Would you try
and do exactly what I said,

25:37.891 --> 25:41.190
and call me tomorrow only if
his fever hasn't gone down?

25:41.227 --> 25:43.218
Otherwise, ring me on Monday.

25:44.264 --> 25:46.255
Goodbye.

25:48.501 --> 25:51.368
Jesus Christ! I need a drink.

25:51.404 --> 25:55.602
- I don't know why you put up with it.
- How long have you got?

25:55.642 --> 25:57.667
A while.

25:59.312 --> 26:04.215
Is Alex hating it up there?
I'll bet Lucy's putting her through it.

26:04.250 --> 26:06.775
Why on earth did you go?

26:06.819 --> 26:09.117
Because she wanted me to.

26:09.155 --> 26:12.955
- Because I wanted to.
- How the hell did you get away?

26:44.857 --> 26:46.848
There we are.

26:52.332 --> 26:54.300
What shall we make with this?

26:54.334 --> 26:56.393
You want to get down?

26:56.436 --> 26:59.166
- No, you don't.
- I do.

26:59.205 --> 27:01.196
Off you go, then.

27:16.823 --> 27:19.792
I've come to get the fudge.
You've eaten it!

27:21.494 --> 27:23.792
It was my idea, me who made it

27:23.830 --> 27:26.196
and there's a ton of it left.

27:28.267 --> 27:30.428
Where's Bob gone?

27:30.470 --> 27:32.461
Out.

27:34.474 --> 27:36.465
When's he coming back?

27:37.677 --> 27:39.542
Soon.

27:40.580 --> 27:42.411
What have you been doing?

27:42.448 --> 27:45.349
Why don't you know
exactly when he's coming back?

27:45.385 --> 27:50.652
Oh, do stop it, lovely. I do know.
I just can't be bothered to tell you.

27:52.191 --> 27:54.455
Has Bob walked out on you?

27:54.994 --> 27:57.622
I expect that's why you're overeating.

28:06.439 --> 28:09.101
Bludgeoned into feeling something.

28:20.019 --> 28:23.386
Can't see being a fanatic. Can you?

28:24.924 --> 28:26.653
I'm not at all sure.

28:38.604 --> 28:40.595
Do you honestly feel Jewish?

28:42.075 --> 28:44.339
Not particularly.

28:44.377 --> 28:48.211
Only at school when there were
eight of us amongst 250.

28:49.382 --> 28:51.714
I like chopped liver.

28:54.420 --> 28:57.116
When will we make
our famous trip to Italy?

28:57.156 --> 29:00.557
I can go at the end of the month.
Can you?

29:00.593 --> 29:02.618
Yeah.

29:31.758 --> 29:33.623
Three.

29:33.659 --> 29:36.219
Four.

29:36.262 --> 29:38.162
Five.

29:39.198 --> 29:41.189
They're not going to answer.

29:45.538 --> 29:48.268
One moment, I'll take it for you.

30:09.595 --> 30:11.756
Oh, my God.

30:14.700 --> 30:16.691
Christ!

30:28.281 --> 30:30.749
Get off! Get off!

30:30.783 --> 30:32.774
You swine!

30:41.394 --> 30:45.330
Oh, turn the main switch off,
you'll electrocute yourself.

30:45.364 --> 30:48.629
- Do you think I can't to mend a fuse?
- Yes.

30:55.107 --> 30:57.735
Oh, shit. Now that's gone.

30:57.777 --> 31:00.541
I wish they'd have American fuses here.

31:00.580 --> 31:04.038
Whenever you're stuck,
everything is better in America.

31:04.083 --> 31:06.074
How do you know?

31:07.753 --> 31:09.812
- There.
- Oh, well done.

31:10.623 --> 31:12.955
How lucky that you're here.

31:14.227 --> 31:17.526
Don't push it. Just don't push it.

31:18.030 --> 31:20.430
I never mentioned him.

31:20.466 --> 31:24.527
- Use his name if you must bring him up.
- I didn't bring him up.

31:25.104 --> 31:27.436
No, but I could hear you thinking it.

31:28.608 --> 31:32.874
Why don't you piss off upstairs
and let me know what's working?

31:37.383 --> 31:39.248
I need the torch.

31:39.285 --> 31:41.810
You can see by the candle.

31:41.854 --> 31:43.845
Christ!

31:48.027 --> 31:50.325
Bastard.

31:50.363 --> 31:52.354
Does this one work?

31:52.398 --> 31:54.389
No.

31:56.869 --> 31:59.895
- How about that one?
- No.

31:59.939 --> 32:01.930
Yes! No!

32:05.511 --> 32:07.376
Yes.

32:08.414 --> 32:10.405
Is Bob back?

32:14.587 --> 32:18.717
- Is everything all right?
- Shouldn't you be asleep?

32:23.329 --> 32:26.321
That hasn't been on
since the Crimean War.

32:27.667 --> 32:30.761
- I missed you.
- What, upstairs?

32:32.071 --> 32:34.539
Today.

32:34.573 --> 32:37.337
Don't go on at me
like some possessive wife.

32:37.376 --> 32:40.971
I feel like a possessive wife,
left alone with five children,

32:41.013 --> 32:44.176
- one dog, one monkey...
- You've never complained before.

32:44.216 --> 32:48.653
I've never been alone before. This was
supposed to be a proper weekend.

32:50.089 --> 32:54.082
I know you're not getting enough of me
but you're getting all there is.

32:54.126 --> 32:57.584
Perhaps you're
spreading yourself a little thin.

32:57.630 --> 32:59.621
Drop it.

33:56.222 --> 34:00.249
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

34:05.097 --> 34:07.088
You are a silly tart.

34:14.139 --> 34:18.577
- Oh, God. The car's parked miles away.
- Gumboot time.

34:18.610 --> 34:22.103
- Bloody English weather.
- Better make a dash for it.

34:27.686 --> 34:30.587
- Taxi! Taxi!
- Taxi!

34:30.623 --> 34:33.420
- Let's run for it.
- Anyone got a paper?

34:40.833 --> 34:42.824
- Bye.
- Bye.

35:00.853 --> 35:02.844
..the economic crisis.

35:02.888 --> 35:06.824
And the cabinet has been
in almost continuous session.

35:06.859 --> 35:08.759
It broke up an hour ago.

35:08.794 --> 35:13.060
At one point, TUC leaders,
meeting to discuss the emergency,

35:13.099 --> 35:15.192
were called in by the prime minister.

35:15.234 --> 35:19.193
They were there for two hours,
and our political editor understands

35:19.238 --> 35:22.230
that there were some
acrimonious exchanges...

35:24.844 --> 35:27.312
And the program Saturday Nightride.

35:41.794 --> 35:43.785
Hello!

35:47.433 --> 35:49.867
Hey, I said hello.

35:49.902 --> 35:52.564
You don't remember me?

35:52.605 --> 35:54.232
No, I don't.

35:54.273 --> 35:58.073
Look, don't pretend
that you don't remember me!

36:00.613 --> 36:02.171
Stop it!

36:05.885 --> 36:08.115
All right. Get in.

36:15.294 --> 36:17.159
Oh, Christ. He'll have me.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.094
- Is everything all right, sir?
- Yes, Officer.

36:24.136 --> 36:25.967
I know him.

36:26.005 --> 36:29.338
I'm a doctor. He's hurt his hand.
I'll see that he's all right.

36:29.375 --> 36:31.366
I see.

36:50.196 --> 36:53.097
Well, how are you keeping?

36:55.367 --> 36:57.426
Christ, my hand hurts.

36:59.905 --> 37:01.998
Do you think it's broken?

37:02.041 --> 37:04.737
No. You can move your fingers.

37:04.777 --> 37:07.109
It's probably just bruised.

37:13.052 --> 37:16.579
You just stop pretending
that you don't remember, eh?

37:17.623 --> 37:19.818
I remember you perfectly well.

37:19.858 --> 37:22.190
You were pissed the last time.

37:33.973 --> 37:36.703
Are we going back to your place, then?

37:36.742 --> 37:38.903
No. I'm dropping you off.

37:40.479 --> 37:44.643
On the way I'll call up a chemist
and get you a painkiller for that.

37:47.319 --> 37:49.810
Look where you're going, will you?

37:51.590 --> 37:55.151
You're not much of a bleeding driver,
are you...Doctor?

38:01.033 --> 38:03.263
Are you in love?

38:03.302 --> 38:04.633
Probably.

38:11.076 --> 38:13.510
Poor old Danny.

38:13.545 --> 38:15.536
Christ.

38:16.815 --> 38:19.375
You even remember my name.

39:11.937 --> 39:13.802
Thank you, madam.

39:13.839 --> 39:16.000
Has the doctor got a relief?

39:34.360 --> 39:38.319
I can't accept this.
That looks just like an initial.

39:38.364 --> 39:40.924
- That's my signature.
- Are you a doctor?

39:40.966 --> 39:45.096
- Yes. Hirsh.
- Where did you get this prescription?

39:45.137 --> 39:49.130
It's the same signature
as on my driving license. Here.

39:57.850 --> 40:00.182
I must have forgotten to sign it.

40:00.219 --> 40:03.814
I'll get my instrument case from the car
to identify myself,

40:03.856 --> 40:06.086
as you're being so difficult.

41:14.793 --> 41:16.818
..something for Mum and Dad.

41:16.862 --> 41:22.095
I thought it would be nice to play for you
that lovely tune by Mendelssohn,

41:22.134 --> 41:24.125
On Wings Of Song.

41:38.817 --> 41:41.786
- Morning.
- Morning.

41:45.123 --> 41:47.114
I've got two Sunday Times.

41:56.368 --> 41:59.166
- Thanks.
- Your bulbs are flourishing.

42:12.985 --> 42:15.146
Stop! You silly dog.

42:33.338 --> 42:34.600
Come on, Timothy!

42:47.553 --> 42:51.990
- She's a lovely little girI, isn't she?
- She's not a girI. He's a boy.

42:52.024 --> 42:54.959
Come on! We'll launch it.

43:00.332 --> 43:02.197
Ready, steady...

43:02.234 --> 43:03.565
Go!

43:04.603 --> 43:09.939
- Wave! Come back, balloons!
- Come back!

43:30.862 --> 43:32.853
Have a look at that.

43:37.102 --> 43:39.093
Let me see.

43:40.772 --> 43:42.763
Come on.

43:55.887 --> 43:57.878
Come on, Timothy.

44:07.599 --> 44:09.624
I think it's time to go home.

44:12.504 --> 44:16.201
All righty. Time to go home.

44:17.242 --> 44:19.335
Come on, Kenyatta. Oh, stop it.

44:20.379 --> 44:22.347
One, two, three!

44:29.421 --> 44:31.446
Come on, Kenyatta.

44:36.862 --> 44:38.557
Look at me!

44:39.264 --> 44:43.701
- Come on.
- Lucy! Be careful!

45:00.686 --> 45:02.711
You stupid girI!

45:02.754 --> 45:06.246
- Running across the road like that.
- Why did you do that?

45:06.291 --> 45:09.818
Why did you run across
the road like that, you naughty girI?

45:09.861 --> 45:12.853
- Is that your dog?
- You took that corner like a maniac!

45:12.898 --> 45:17.130
- It should've been on a lead!
- You can't do that! See all this traffic?

45:17.169 --> 45:20.332
How many times have you been told
not to run across a road?

45:20.372 --> 45:24.035
You might have been killed!
Do you hear me?

45:35.954 --> 45:38.320
Stop it.

45:38.356 --> 45:42.292
Stop it. Do you hear me?
Stop that screaming. Stop it.

45:43.328 --> 45:46.491
It's all right. Now stop it. Stop it. All right.

45:49.101 --> 45:51.695
You're all the same. You charge around...

45:51.737 --> 45:53.728
What do mean ''charge''?

45:54.940 --> 45:59.070
Stop crying. Stay there and look
after the children. All right?

45:59.111 --> 46:01.102
Now, stay there.

46:04.416 --> 46:08.409
Look, get the kids home.
I'll cope with this.

46:10.589 --> 46:14.286
Off we go. Home.
Come on. Come on, now.

46:14.326 --> 46:16.487
Everything's all right.

46:16.528 --> 46:18.928
Be back soon.

46:39.151 --> 46:43.087
We won't see him anymore. We won't.

46:45.056 --> 46:47.115
That isn't the doggy.

46:48.193 --> 46:49.592
I'm ready.

46:49.628 --> 46:51.755
Now fold your papers.

46:52.597 --> 46:55.862
- One, two, three. Swap!
- Ready, steady...swap!

46:57.369 --> 46:59.496
Now we all draw bodies.

47:33.605 --> 47:35.596
Shall we turn these into ears?

47:35.640 --> 47:37.631
Right? Big, big ears.

48:00.765 --> 48:05.327
Take care of yourself, Alex.
I'll give you a hand with that tonight.

48:20.285 --> 48:23.482
Stop! Stop, somebody! Stop!

48:23.521 --> 48:26.490
Stop him! My daddy's forgotten
his gas mask!

48:27.559 --> 48:30.585
Stop him, somebody! He'll get killed!

48:33.598 --> 48:37.364
My father's forgotten his gas mask!
He'll get killed!

49:04.796 --> 49:07.128
You don't need those.

49:11.970 --> 49:14.404
I keep thinking it could have been Lucy.

49:14.439 --> 49:17.602
Well, it wasn't. Right?

49:21.646 --> 49:23.637
Come on.

51:15.226 --> 51:16.921
Hi, Tommy?

51:16.961 --> 51:20.453
Has the thing come back
from the workshop yet? It has?

51:21.499 --> 51:23.490
I'd love to see it.

51:24.569 --> 51:27.060
No, I couldn't possibly leave here.

51:54.432 --> 51:57.765
Timothy, bed. Come on. Bed.

51:57.802 --> 52:00.430
Bed. Come on now.

52:00.472 --> 52:03.669
Bed, darling. Come on, please.

52:03.708 --> 52:05.903
Off to bed, Timothy.

52:05.944 --> 52:08.105
- Stop it.
- You've been told.

52:09.147 --> 52:12.310
I'm sorry. I must have been
flat out for hours.

52:12.350 --> 52:16.309
We crept up but you looked as if
you needed the rest.

52:16.354 --> 52:18.117
Stop it.

52:18.156 --> 52:19.783
You must be exhausted.

52:21.459 --> 52:25.828
Timothy, stop it. Come away from there,
he's trying to concentrate.

52:25.864 --> 52:27.855
Come on. Bed.

52:29.701 --> 52:32.864
Professor Johns
gave such a marvelous lecture.

52:32.904 --> 52:36.431
- Didn't he, Bill?
- He did indeed. Off to bed.

52:36.474 --> 52:41.275
- He's trying to remember what he said.
- All of you. I'll take that.

52:41.312 --> 52:44.543
- Say good night to Alex, darling.
- Good night!

52:49.354 --> 52:54.155
- I'm terribly sorry about Kenyatta.
- Must have been awful for you.

52:54.759 --> 52:58.320
Anyway, we're buying another
for Lucy's birthday.

52:58.897 --> 53:01.457
Good night.
Thank you for looking after us.

53:01.499 --> 53:04.991
- Night, Lucy.
- Good night, Mama, good night, Papa.

53:07.605 --> 53:11.041
Lucy took it rather hard.
Has she ever seen anyone dead before?

53:11.075 --> 53:14.442
Oh, yes. They all saw Granny
when she was dead.

53:14.479 --> 53:17.846
We just think it's very important
not to pretend.

53:20.151 --> 53:22.051
Where's Bob?

53:22.086 --> 53:24.919
He's upstairs working with his mates.

53:24.956 --> 53:28.016
Darling, there are nine for dinner.

53:28.059 --> 53:30.050
Could you look at the meat?

53:30.862 --> 53:33.729
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

53:35.033 --> 53:38.594
- I feel it ought to be more mobile.
- More mobile? In what way?

53:40.004 --> 53:43.906
- A stand or something.
- It has to be rigid. This'll wobble.

53:43.942 --> 53:46.843
And high to compensate
for these pendulums.

53:46.878 --> 53:49.403
We could have a tripod.
Look good in chrome.

53:49.447 --> 53:51.608
Maybe a telescopic tripod.

53:51.649 --> 53:55.949
It'd be like having furniture in the middle
of the room. That's not right.

53:55.987 --> 53:59.650
If you were an American businessman,
which would you prefer -

53:59.691 --> 54:02.125
something you could push
around the office

54:02.160 --> 54:05.095
or a permanent fixture up on the wall?

54:05.129 --> 54:08.690
- I think on the wall. Try it.
- That's what we thought.

54:08.733 --> 54:11.725
- Stick it on the wall.
- Pass it over. Lift it up.

54:11.769 --> 54:14.465
We won't need all these holes
to start with.

54:14.505 --> 54:18.032
- It needs a chrome bolt.
- Chrome will be a nightmare.

54:18.076 --> 54:21.512
It's the American answer to worry beads.

54:21.546 --> 54:23.810
Why don't we make it in America?

54:43.368 --> 54:46.098
Drop me off here at the lights.
I'll get a cab.

54:49.007 --> 54:52.841
- Aren't you coming home?
- Got to get my eight hours.

55:00.251 --> 55:02.412
See you. Bye.

56:54.266 --> 56:55.927
Thank you.

57:11.283 --> 57:13.274
Must be New York.

57:25.931 --> 57:28.229
Harry, I've realized a couple of million.

57:28.266 --> 57:32.066
I'm looking for a good home for them.
Any suggestions?

57:32.104 --> 57:35.005
Such as short-dated treasury bonds.

57:35.040 --> 57:37.031
Well, what are they?

57:37.976 --> 57:40.274
Now, wait, wait, wait!

57:40.312 --> 57:42.303
I'll just work it out.

57:44.416 --> 57:46.407
She's very well.

57:47.119 --> 57:49.349
How's Cathy?

57:49.387 --> 57:52.618
I do wish you wouldn't have
David to dine here.

57:53.658 --> 57:56.718
Father and I are fond of him.

57:56.761 --> 57:58.888
Yes, well...

57:58.930 --> 58:00.921
I wish you wouldn't.

58:02.667 --> 58:05.966
He's rather bitter
about your taking the books.

58:06.004 --> 58:08.905
They were mine. They were all I took.

58:08.940 --> 58:12.603
- They leave gaps, he says.
- Oh, Jesus.

58:12.644 --> 58:16.944
Does being married ever
come down to anything but property?

58:16.982 --> 58:18.973
Sometimes.

58:20.886 --> 58:23.582
He wants you back, you know.

58:23.622 --> 58:25.954
I don't want to hear about that.

58:31.663 --> 58:33.995
You see too little of people.

58:35.734 --> 58:37.167
Enough.

58:37.802 --> 58:39.793
I mean too little of Daddy.

58:41.173 --> 58:44.734
It's not much use
to start wanting things of him.

58:44.776 --> 58:47.643
I'm not always very good
at stopping myself.

58:47.679 --> 58:49.203
What, you?

58:57.489 --> 59:00.549
- Other line.
- It's been a heavy week.

59:00.592 --> 59:04.528
It's always been a heavy week.
Why do you put up with it?

59:04.629 --> 59:07.063
You're complaining about your father.

59:07.098 --> 59:11.034
Perhaps you're complaining about
whoever it is you're seeing.

59:14.439 --> 59:17.067
Who are you seeing now?

59:17.108 --> 59:21.204
- The same person. On and off.
- On and off?

59:21.246 --> 59:23.237
You don't give it a chance.

59:23.281 --> 59:25.545
Having an affair with someone
on and off

59:25.584 --> 59:29.714
is no worse than being married
for a course or two at meal times.

59:32.457 --> 59:34.948
What sort of man is he?

59:34.993 --> 59:37.518
I don't think you'd like his haircut.

59:37.562 --> 59:39.223
Is he a hippie?

59:39.264 --> 59:42.563
I like hippies.
They hate business and competition.

59:42.601 --> 59:45.263
That's what makes them so attractive.

59:48.139 --> 59:50.039
You keep throwing your hand in

59:50.075 --> 59:52.737
because you haven't got the whole thing.

59:52.777 --> 59:54.802
There is no whole thing.

59:54.846 --> 59:56.837
You have to make it work.

01:00:00.919 --> 01:00:03.251
I left your father once.

01:00:04.823 --> 01:00:06.791
When?

01:00:06.825 --> 01:00:10.761
You were three.
We disagreed about everything.

01:00:10.795 --> 01:00:13.127
Everything seemed impossible.

01:00:14.366 --> 01:00:17.199
He left me alone. It was good of him.

01:00:18.603 --> 01:00:21.766
But I was mad not to know
how much I'd miss him.

01:00:24.509 --> 01:00:28.639
You think it's nothing but it's not nothing.

01:00:47.065 --> 01:00:49.363
- Good night.
- Good night, Mr. Brown.

01:00:49.401 --> 01:00:51.699
- How are you keeping?
- Fine. And you?

01:00:51.736 --> 01:00:53.931
- Very well.
- Good.

01:01:33.111 --> 01:01:37.343
- Message desk.
- Any messages for me?

01:01:37.382 --> 01:01:39.441
Nothing for you, Miss Greville.

01:01:39.484 --> 01:01:42.282
- That's a relief.
- Will you be picking up now?

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:45.653
No, I'm going to bed.
I'm only in if Mr. Elkin rings.

01:01:45.690 --> 01:01:49.182
Would you tell him to ring twice
so I'll know it's him?

01:01:49.227 --> 01:01:54.688
Have you tried him at 937-3000?
He's often there.

01:01:54.733 --> 01:01:57.600
I wouldn't want to ring him there.
It's a doctor.

01:01:57.635 --> 01:02:02.004
Yes, I know, it's Dr. Hearsh.
Dr. Hearsh also uses this service.

01:02:04.843 --> 01:02:06.504
Right.

01:02:33.805 --> 01:02:40.040
''Dear Reggie, for some time now,
I have felt the need for a change.''

01:02:40.078 --> 01:02:42.706
Oh, no.

01:02:42.747 --> 01:02:45.511
''I badly need...'' No.

01:02:47.719 --> 01:02:52.156
''Dear Reggie,
this is a letter of resignation.

01:02:53.191 --> 01:02:55.318
''Please don't be surprised.''

01:02:56.361 --> 01:02:58.955
It's too difficult to explain?

01:02:58.997 --> 01:03:01.932
''It's too complicated to explain.

01:03:03.635 --> 01:03:07.799
''I'm getting stale
and I don't feel I'm really at my best.

01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:12.639
''I'd like to go as soon as I can.

01:03:12.677 --> 01:03:14.975
''I'm sure this is the right decision.''

01:03:16.681 --> 01:03:20.913
It's my age, isn't it? When you're over 50
in business, you're over the hump.

01:03:20.952 --> 01:03:23.978
- You shouldn't say that.
- You get a golden handshake

01:03:24.022 --> 01:03:27.048
or a sherry party
and you can't find another job.

01:03:27.091 --> 01:03:28.991
- That's that.
- Night, Alex.

01:03:29.527 --> 01:03:32.087
This place would be all right if it had walls.

01:03:32.130 --> 01:03:35.327
You'd have got this job
if you hadn't invented a degree.

01:03:35.366 --> 01:03:39.496
- Why did you do it?
- There's no point going on about it.

01:03:39.537 --> 01:03:42.700
You'd been accepted,
then you make a muck of it.

01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:45.868
Why come here
if you won't let us help you?

01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:50.540
You? It's firms like you
that are putting me out to grass.

01:03:50.582 --> 01:03:54.211
- Me and all the other 50-year-olds.
- You told me 55.

01:03:54.252 --> 01:03:55.913
50.

01:03:56.921 --> 01:03:59.253
Hang on to that, then.

01:04:04.028 --> 01:04:06.758
Would you like to have done engineering?

01:04:14.739 --> 01:04:17.071
You're a very attractive girI.

01:04:20.678 --> 01:04:22.669
Well, you've...

01:04:24.516 --> 01:04:27.383
You've messed this chance up and I...

01:04:27.418 --> 01:04:29.909
I don't think
we're going to be able to fix...

01:04:31.923 --> 01:04:33.914
I'm so sorry.

01:04:36.694 --> 01:04:38.355
They'll take up references.

01:04:41.132 --> 01:04:43.066
Don't you start.

01:04:51.776 --> 01:04:55.439
Can you help me or not?
Are you an expert or not?

01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:58.176
I've been behind a bigger desk
for 20 years.

01:04:58.216 --> 01:05:01.242
I've had three secretaries at a time.

01:05:01.286 --> 01:05:05.450
If it's any comfort to you,
I won't be here after next week.

01:05:06.758 --> 01:05:08.919
I'm packing it in.

01:05:08.993 --> 01:05:11.484
Then who am I supposed to deal with?

01:05:27.045 --> 01:05:29.240
Are you really all right?

01:05:30.281 --> 01:05:33.273
The face-lift's gone. That's what you'll see.

01:05:37.188 --> 01:05:39.622
You didn't know that, did you?

01:05:46.831 --> 01:05:49.322
We can get our faces done too, you know.

01:05:50.101 --> 01:05:53.662
For interviews.
They told me down the corridor.

01:05:53.705 --> 01:05:55.764
It lasts two days.

01:05:56.307 --> 01:05:58.969
They...stretch the skin.

01:06:01.312 --> 01:06:03.803
I surprise myself. I look 42.

01:06:06.184 --> 01:06:10.280
I didn't go home.
I thought it might upset my wife.

01:06:11.689 --> 01:06:15.125
We're all right, you see.

01:06:20.531 --> 01:06:24.297
- How am I going to tell her?
- She doesn't know about the sack?

01:06:33.978 --> 01:06:36.879
Yes, that's right. Like that.

01:06:43.921 --> 01:06:45.980
Two words!

01:06:46.024 --> 01:06:47.992
Book?

01:06:48.559 --> 01:06:50.891
- First word!
- Hands?

01:06:51.729 --> 01:06:54.721
- Peering.
- Love?

01:06:54.766 --> 01:06:57.997
- Adoration.
- Glory.

01:06:58.036 --> 01:07:00.129
- Halo?
- Devout. Devout.

01:07:00.171 --> 01:07:02.469
Looking? Peering.

01:07:04.208 --> 01:07:06.199
- Butterfly!
- Pilgrim's Progress.

01:07:06.244 --> 01:07:07.871
- Adoration.
- Heavens Above.

01:07:07.912 --> 01:07:10.380
- All This And Heaven Too.
- Lost?

01:07:10.415 --> 01:07:12.542
Paradise.

01:07:12.583 --> 01:07:14.574
Oh, Paradise Lost.

01:07:16.688 --> 01:07:18.588
Four words.

01:07:19.590 --> 01:07:23.253
- Love For Sale.
- Passion.

01:07:23.294 --> 01:07:25.159
Pain.

01:07:25.196 --> 01:07:27.255
- Stomachache.
- Appendix!

01:07:27.298 --> 01:07:30.426
- My Heart Belongs To Daddy.
- Haggerty.

01:07:30.468 --> 01:07:33.869
- My Heart And I!
- I'm Just Wild About Harry.

01:07:33.905 --> 01:07:37.397
- Nobody Knows The Trouble I've Seen.
- Pack Up Your Troubles!

01:07:58.429 --> 01:08:00.590
- Dancing.
- Goldfish.

01:08:01.666 --> 01:08:03.224
- Touch?
- Eel.

01:08:03.267 --> 01:08:05.565
Pocket.

01:08:06.771 --> 01:08:09.171
- The Touch Of Your Lips.
- Fear.

01:08:09.207 --> 01:08:10.902
- Fear.
- Flesh.

01:08:10.942 --> 01:08:13.706
''The poor little thing
was so skinny and thin.''

01:08:13.745 --> 01:08:16.714
- Skin deep.
- You.

01:08:16.747 --> 01:08:19.546
- Skin under?
- I've Got You Under My Skin.

01:08:21.519 --> 01:08:23.510
I'm coming!

01:08:24.788 --> 01:08:28.622
- Where's my manuscript?
- Hello. Is it over or are we on time?

01:08:28.658 --> 01:08:30.593
- On my desk...
- What's going on?

01:08:30.627 --> 01:08:33.721
- It's gone on all evening.
- All through dinner.

01:08:33.765 --> 01:08:37.064
- My desk!
- I'm going in, and you're coming too.

01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:39.934
- Where's my manuscript?
- It's only a cookbook.

01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:42.371
Small word.

01:08:44.008 --> 01:08:46.568
My God! Children's games?

01:08:51.314 --> 01:08:53.783
I might have known
you'd be in the best seat.

01:08:53.818 --> 01:08:55.809
Call girIs on strike?

01:08:55.853 --> 01:08:58.252
Come on, start the game.

01:08:58.288 --> 01:09:00.519
Why go through
Pelham Crescent anyway?

01:09:00.558 --> 01:09:03.857
Nobody ever goes that way.
You were thinking about her.

01:09:03.895 --> 01:09:06.625
Of course I wasn't. Sit down and behave.

01:09:06.663 --> 01:09:08.928
- Don't I get a drink?
- What are we doing?

01:09:08.966 --> 01:09:12.732
The first one is five, a film,
and this is the second word.

01:09:14.238 --> 01:09:16.832
Plonk? Isn't there any vodka left?

01:09:18.075 --> 01:09:20.669
A little for her. She's had enough already.

01:09:20.711 --> 01:09:23.339
- Muscle.
- Expanse.

01:09:23.381 --> 01:09:26.111
- Not loudest, best.
- Big one.

01:09:28.986 --> 01:09:31.613
- Good gracious!
- Thank you.

01:09:31.656 --> 01:09:33.385
- Big.
- Massive! Massive!

01:09:33.424 --> 01:09:35.654
- Seven Pillars Of Wisdom.
- The Big Country.

01:09:35.693 --> 01:09:37.991
Potemkin?

01:09:38.029 --> 01:09:41.055
Ingrid is the last au pair girI
we're going to have.

01:09:41.098 --> 01:09:45.660
- I never laid a finger on her.
- Ingrid is the last fucking au pair girI

01:09:45.703 --> 01:09:48.729
we're ever going to have!
The way you stare at her...

01:09:48.773 --> 01:09:53.210
- Listen to me.
- Oh, piss off, Daniel, you know nothing!

01:09:53.243 --> 01:09:56.645
Don't you walk away from me
when I'm talking to you!

01:09:56.681 --> 01:09:59.980
- For goodness' sake, you two!
- When I tell you...

01:10:00.017 --> 01:10:02.076
Charming!

01:10:04.121 --> 01:10:07.318
- ..he's the best one of them all!
- You fucking bitch.

01:10:08.326 --> 01:10:11.557
Get bloody Kenneth
to pour you another one...

01:10:11.596 --> 01:10:13.826
You fucking bastard!

01:10:13.865 --> 01:10:15.662
Here come those tired old tits again.

01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:18.601
What the hell are you doing?
All right. Go on!

01:10:20.938 --> 01:10:23.736
No, darling! No.

01:10:28.779 --> 01:10:30.770
- Where are you going?
- I'm going.

01:10:30.815 --> 01:10:34.945
- Thanks for the support.
- They're ridiculous.

01:10:34.986 --> 01:10:37.318
I don't like them when they're like this.

01:10:37.355 --> 01:10:41.291
- Why see them?
- I didn't invite them. You let them in.

01:10:41.859 --> 01:10:44.191
- Oh, sorry.
- Come on.

01:10:45.229 --> 01:10:49.165
Don't go now. Go upstairs.
I'll get rid of them

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:52.260
- and I'll come up in a minute.
- I'd rather be on my own.

01:10:52.303 --> 01:10:55.602
- They're your friends.
- Typical! Plain bloody selfish!

01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:58.871
- I can't stand people carrying on!
- Right.

01:10:59.343 --> 01:11:01.243
OK, out!

01:11:01.279 --> 01:11:02.712
Right!

01:11:15.393 --> 01:11:17.657
All right, you two. Get out!

01:11:17.695 --> 01:11:19.356
Now piss off!

01:11:19.397 --> 01:11:21.388
That's enough!

01:11:22.233 --> 01:11:23.928
Christ.

01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:59.733
- Very well. I'll tell her that.
- Hello? Hello?

01:12:11.315 --> 01:12:14.807
- Message desk.
- What was that message?

01:12:14.852 --> 01:12:19.050
Mr. Elgin just rang. I said I thought
you were in but not picking up.

01:12:19.657 --> 01:12:22.717
- What did he say?
- Could he come over straightaway?

01:12:26.664 --> 01:12:28.325
Thanks.

01:12:46.083 --> 01:12:48.244
It's nice to see you.

01:12:53.424 --> 01:12:55.415
George.

01:12:55.459 --> 01:12:57.484
Come down.

01:12:59.864 --> 01:13:03.265
George, this is Bob Elkin. George Harding.

01:13:04.301 --> 01:13:06.963
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

01:13:08.239 --> 01:13:10.571
- Would you like a drink?
- Yeah.

01:13:12.610 --> 01:13:14.601
You know where they are.

01:13:16.947 --> 01:13:19.507
- I think I'd better be going.
- Not yet.

01:13:19.550 --> 01:13:21.882
I must catch my train.

01:13:23.187 --> 01:13:25.849
- Thank you for my dinner.
- Thank you.

01:13:25.890 --> 01:13:27.824
Thanks.

01:13:28.859 --> 01:13:32.625
We'll see each other next week.
Will you telephone?

01:13:32.663 --> 01:13:36.997
- You won't be at the office.
- Next week I will. After that, here.

01:13:46.210 --> 01:13:49.407
- Goodbye.
- Thanks again.

01:13:49.447 --> 01:13:51.381
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

01:14:11.669 --> 01:14:15.264
Does this thing ever work
or is it just for decoration?

01:14:17.508 --> 01:14:19.976
No, it should work.

01:14:20.010 --> 01:14:22.478
It is bloody freezing, isn't it?

01:14:22.513 --> 01:14:26.142
Haven't got any logs.
There's some rubbish that might burn.

01:14:30.654 --> 01:14:34.181
I am glad you came. It's so nice to see you.

01:14:37.228 --> 01:14:40.220
It looked as if
I was interrupting something.

01:14:45.302 --> 01:14:49.466
- I thought you'd be alone at this hour.
- Well, we're alone now.

01:14:52.176 --> 01:14:54.371
Do stop looking so desolate.

01:14:57.081 --> 01:14:59.242
You've had your hair cut.

01:15:00.951 --> 01:15:04.284
- It doesn't look as bad as I thought.
- Thank you.

01:15:07.391 --> 01:15:09.825
This won't burn for more than ten minutes.

01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:12.920
There's some wood on the roof.
Want to get it?

01:16:04.048 --> 01:16:07.211
Bloody heating.
I'm going to have to change it.

01:16:07.952 --> 01:16:10.045
Where are you?

01:16:27.204 --> 01:16:29.536
Who was that man last night?

01:16:31.041 --> 01:16:33.373
I told you. His name's George.

01:16:36.947 --> 01:16:38.938
Who is he?

01:16:42.086 --> 01:16:45.613
He's a man from the office
who's lost his job

01:16:45.656 --> 01:16:48.147
and I'm trying to find him another.

01:16:50.127 --> 01:16:53.255
- Do you mind about him?
- No.

01:16:57.034 --> 01:16:59.059
You really don't mind, do you?

01:17:00.004 --> 01:17:03.667
No, not a bit.
We're free to do what we want.

01:17:05.509 --> 01:17:07.272
Darling...

01:17:08.312 --> 01:17:12.646
other people often do
what they don't want to do at all.

01:18:14.411 --> 01:18:17.710
- Just a vaccination for smallpox, please.
- Boost?

01:18:17.748 --> 01:18:20.012
When was the last time?

01:18:20.050 --> 01:18:22.780
When I was born, I suppose.

01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:25.755
- Are you right- or left-handed?
- Right-handed.

01:18:25.789 --> 01:18:27.780
The left arm.

01:18:28.692 --> 01:18:32.321
- Where are you off to?
- New York, probably.

01:18:32.363 --> 01:18:36.197
You should try San Francisco.
That's a lovely place.

01:18:41.405 --> 01:18:44.067
Then from Verona, La Garda

01:18:44.108 --> 01:18:46.440
down to Ravenna and then...

01:18:46.477 --> 01:18:48.206
Just a minute.

01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:54.146
Verona. Museums,
opera, mountains, hotels.

01:18:55.185 --> 01:18:57.176
- Thank you.
- Ravenna.

01:18:57.221 --> 01:18:59.746
Churches, beaches, hotels.

01:19:00.791 --> 01:19:04.352
Then we were going
to motor down from Ravenna

01:19:04.395 --> 01:19:06.693
through Umbria to Siena.

01:19:10.367 --> 01:19:14.428
Siena. Events, churches, hotels.

01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:23.879
- Would you like to see the menu, sir?
- Yes, thank you.

01:19:26.784 --> 01:19:28.979
- Hello, how are you?
- Hello. Fine.

01:19:29.019 --> 01:19:32.011
- Hello, how are you keeping?
- Great.

01:19:35.793 --> 01:19:38.387
Excuse me, sir. I have a message for you.

01:19:38.429 --> 01:19:42.763
Mr. Elkin is not able to come.
Shall I keep your table, sir?

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:46.258
- No, I'm sorry. Cancel it.
- Thank you very much.

01:19:56.580 --> 01:20:01.313
Why didn't you say you were sick
instead of just not turning up, as usual?

01:20:01.351 --> 01:20:03.911
You're not still on about the other night?

01:20:03.954 --> 01:20:05.945
Of course not.

01:20:06.824 --> 01:20:08.815
Open your mouth.

01:20:15.299 --> 01:20:19.827
That seems to be all right.
Have you been eating anything strange?

01:20:19.870 --> 01:20:21.929
I don't think it's that.

01:20:23.073 --> 01:20:25.371
You've certainly got a temperature.

01:20:26.643 --> 01:20:30.079
- Now tell me to take aspirins.
- Take aspirin.

01:20:30.113 --> 01:20:32.809
- And fluids?
- Take fluids.

01:20:32.850 --> 01:20:36.377
I got some bumf about Italy.
How does that grab you?

01:20:40.424 --> 01:20:43.086
Now... Come on. Let's have a listen.

01:20:46.730 --> 01:20:48.994
What's the matter?

01:20:49.032 --> 01:20:51.660
Oh, shit. I might as well tell you.

01:20:51.702 --> 01:20:54.694
I had a vaccination
for smallpox yesterday.

01:20:54.738 --> 01:20:57.730
Why the hell didn't you come to me?

01:20:58.509 --> 01:21:00.340
I just thought...

01:21:01.378 --> 01:21:03.369
I don't know.

01:21:06.583 --> 01:21:08.813
It means you are going to America.

01:21:08.852 --> 01:21:11.650
I think so. But it wouldn't be for long.

01:21:13.357 --> 01:21:17.054
- I always knew Italy was a fiction.
- Oh, don't.

01:21:17.094 --> 01:21:19.494
- We'll go when I get back.
- Pointless.

01:21:19.530 --> 01:21:21.521
I want to go.

01:21:21.565 --> 01:21:23.556
Pointless.

01:21:26.203 --> 01:21:28.694
- Would you like a drink?
- No.

01:21:29.740 --> 01:21:31.571
Thanks.

01:21:39.816 --> 01:21:43.343
You'll be there much longer
than you say, won't you?

01:21:43.387 --> 01:21:45.218
I don't know.

01:21:46.156 --> 01:21:48.818
Have to play it by ear when I get there.

01:21:50.427 --> 01:21:53.157
Will you get a lot of work out of it?

01:21:53.196 --> 01:21:55.187
Maybe.

01:21:57.834 --> 01:21:59.597
We shall fight in France.

01:22:05.442 --> 01:22:09.276
- Do you like the people over there?
- I don't know many.

01:22:09.313 --> 01:22:11.838
It is a chance.

01:22:11.882 --> 01:22:14.749
I don't have to go. I could send Tony.

01:22:15.786 --> 01:22:17.947
Well, you'll have to decide.

01:22:19.456 --> 01:22:22.482
I could never just piss off.

01:22:24.962 --> 01:22:26.930
Have you told Alex?

01:22:26.964 --> 01:22:29.455
- No.
- Why not?

01:22:30.734 --> 01:22:32.861
I don't know what to do.

01:22:32.903 --> 01:22:36.066
Should I go? What do you think?

01:22:38.408 --> 01:22:40.933
I told you, it'll have to be your choice.

01:22:41.979 --> 01:22:45.813
I know it would solve a lot of problems
for you if you went.

01:22:47.451 --> 01:22:49.112
But...

01:23:04.835 --> 01:23:08.236
- Jonathon. Good luck.
- Thank you.

01:23:08.271 --> 01:23:10.364
Daniel. Glad you could make it.

01:23:10.407 --> 01:23:12.568
Hello, Father. Sorry I'm late.

01:26:26.937 --> 01:26:30.703
My dear Daniel, now that you are 13,

01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:33.971
you are a fully fledged member
of the community.

01:26:35.011 --> 01:26:39.209
Today, Daniel,
you start to assume responsibility

01:26:39.249 --> 01:26:42.116
and take your own decisions

01:26:42.152 --> 01:26:47.818
as you prepare yourself to make
your own particular contribution in life.

01:27:04.841 --> 01:27:07.002
Jonathon. Congratulations.

01:27:07.043 --> 01:27:09.341
- You were super. Wasn't he?
- Wonderful.

01:27:09.379 --> 01:27:12.610
- Have you seen David?
- Yes. He's over there.

01:27:12.649 --> 01:27:16.585
Ruth Collins married an Ellis.
That's how we're related.

01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:21.523
- You must know the Hirshes.
- David Hirsh married a niece of mine.

01:27:21.558 --> 01:27:24.652
- Daniel!
- Aunt Sophie.

01:27:24.694 --> 01:27:28.460
Lovely to see you.
Do you remember your cousin Mark?

01:27:28.498 --> 01:27:32.491
Cousin Daniel knew you
when you were just a baby. And Elsa!

01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:39.031
- It's going well.
- Splendidly.

01:27:39.075 --> 01:27:42.238
My brother Daniel, Terry Selby Lowndes,
my new partner.

01:27:42.279 --> 01:27:44.338
So nice to meet you.

01:27:44.381 --> 01:27:47.839
I am delighted that they've come round
to see our way.

01:27:56.693 --> 01:27:58.991
Is it Daniel?

01:27:59.029 --> 01:28:01.190
You don't remember me, do you?

01:28:03.433 --> 01:28:06.664
I'm Emil, your third cousin
on your mother's side.

01:28:07.904 --> 01:28:12.273
We last met at your grandmother's.
She would have loved to be here.

01:28:15.745 --> 01:28:18.373
- I want to talk to you.
- Excuse me.

01:28:18.415 --> 01:28:21.145
You're not going to be
an old fuddy-duddy?

01:28:21.184 --> 01:28:22.583
- Why?

01:28:22.619 --> 01:28:26.749
I put you next to a very nice girI.
She's just got a divorce.

01:28:26.790 --> 01:28:30.248
You will be nice to her, won' t you?
I know you two will get on.

01:28:30.293 --> 01:28:33.660
Hello, darling! Lovely to see you.

01:28:33.697 --> 01:28:35.892
I was sure you weren't going to make it.

01:28:35.932 --> 01:28:38.901
- Hello, Father.
- Hello, Daniel.

01:28:38.935 --> 01:28:41.233
- You know all these people?
- No.

01:28:42.238 --> 01:28:44.297
Quite a do.

01:28:44.874 --> 01:28:47.206
Mostly your brother's business associates.

01:28:50.447 --> 01:28:52.608
And how are you, son?

01:28:53.350 --> 01:28:55.978
Fine. Fine.

01:28:58.888 --> 01:29:01.413
- Aunt Astrid.
- How are you?

01:29:01.458 --> 01:29:04.154
You are looking spruce.

01:29:04.194 --> 01:29:06.321
Have one of these.

01:29:06.896 --> 01:29:09.490
When are you giving us a nice surprise?

01:29:09.532 --> 01:29:12.524
- Still holding out on us?
- Aunt Astrid, don't...

01:29:12.569 --> 01:29:17.165
It's very selfish of you.
You are going to be very lonely.

01:29:17.207 --> 01:29:19.402
I haven't found the right person yet.

01:29:24.180 --> 01:29:26.171
Is that straight?

01:29:26.282 --> 01:29:29.183
- When are you going?
- In a day or two.

01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:34.253
Why did I have to ask you that?
Why didn't you tell me?

01:29:34.290 --> 01:29:35.951
I'll be back.

01:29:36.893 --> 01:29:39.293
You'll be here.

01:29:39.329 --> 01:29:42.492
- We can ring each other up.
- I'm bound to be here.

01:29:43.533 --> 01:29:48.334
- I can't exactly say when I'll be back.
- OK, you have to leave things open.

01:29:50.140 --> 01:29:53.303
You should never
have decided to quit that job.

01:29:53.343 --> 01:29:56.676
You need something to occupy
that piercing mind of yours.

01:29:57.213 --> 01:30:00.876
No. That's absolutely not it.

01:30:00.917 --> 01:30:03.215
I don't get you like this.

01:30:03.253 --> 01:30:05.380
You could come over.

01:30:05.422 --> 01:30:07.413
Could you come over?

01:30:12.595 --> 01:30:15.792
- Nothing's changed.
- I've changed.

01:30:19.702 --> 01:30:22.967
All this fitting in and making do
and shutting up.

01:30:25.275 --> 01:30:29.678
I won't be here when you get back.
I can't come over.

01:30:30.747 --> 01:30:32.806
Don't ring.

01:30:35.318 --> 01:30:37.786
We've got to pack this in and I...

01:30:37.821 --> 01:30:39.812
don't know what else to say.

01:30:39.856 --> 01:30:43.383
Me being careful
not to ask you about Daniel,

01:30:43.426 --> 01:30:46.759
Daniel not getting answers from you
because you're here.

01:30:46.796 --> 01:30:51.028
My old mum not making demands for
umpteen years and my fucking office!

01:30:52.035 --> 01:30:54.367
I don't want us to live like this.

01:30:54.404 --> 01:30:57.896
Shall we try living together?
Shall we try that?

01:30:58.942 --> 01:31:00.933
I don't want to lose you.

01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:05.471
Darling, you...

01:31:06.716 --> 01:31:08.707
You couldn't do it.

01:31:09.886 --> 01:31:12.616
Whenever there's any trouble,
you always...

01:31:12.655 --> 01:31:14.646
Oh, damn.

01:31:20.196 --> 01:31:22.664
I'm not angry with you.

01:31:23.733 --> 01:31:27.692
I bought it because I love you.
Your terms were rotten

01:31:27.737 --> 01:31:29.932
and I shouldn't have done it. My fault.

01:31:30.807 --> 01:31:34.470
- You keep asking too much.
- For God's sake!

01:31:36.513 --> 01:31:39.676
Caring a lot about someone,
is that too much?

01:31:40.717 --> 01:31:44.778
People who have some time
for each other, is that too much?

01:31:45.355 --> 01:31:48.085
I've had this
''Anything is better than nothing.''

01:31:48.124 --> 01:31:51.252
Sometimes nothing
has to be better than anything.

01:31:58.134 --> 01:32:01.228
If you look back on this,
which you won't,

01:32:03.173 --> 01:32:06.074
you'll think it has
something to do with Daniel.

01:32:06.109 --> 01:32:08.100
Well, it hasn't.

01:32:22.659 --> 01:32:25.321
New York for you. Wouldn't you know?

01:32:38.074 --> 01:32:40.065
Put him on, please.

01:32:45.415 --> 01:32:47.975
What's the joke?

01:32:48.017 --> 01:32:50.952
I was thinking of someone else.

01:32:50.987 --> 01:32:53.148
Yeah, hi!

01:32:53.189 --> 01:32:55.589
Could you speak up a bit? Sorry, I can't...

01:32:55.625 --> 01:32:57.991
My old mum, actually...

01:32:58.027 --> 01:33:01.019
- Yeah?
- ..and that I love you a lot.

01:33:01.064 --> 01:33:04.397
- What? Yeah!
- I don't want you to go.

01:33:04.434 --> 01:33:09.565
Yeah! Tuesday. Lovely! Yeah!
What sort of time?

01:33:09.606 --> 01:33:12.939
When? Fantastic!

01:33:41.604 --> 01:33:43.902
Bar Mitzvah host and hostess,

01:33:44.941 --> 01:33:47.102
ladies and gentlemen,

01:33:47.143 --> 01:33:51.045
pray silence for grace
by the Rabbi Eisenberg.

01:34:05.728 --> 01:34:07.787
- You're a doctor, aren't you?
- Yes.

01:34:14.737 --> 01:34:18.138
Dr. Hearsh, I'm sorry to drag you
from your party,

01:34:18.174 --> 01:34:23.407
but there's an urgent call for you to ring
the R.M.O. at St. Stephen's Hospital.

01:34:23.446 --> 01:34:27.314
- Anything else? Did Mr. Elkin ring?
- No, he didn't.

01:34:27.350 --> 01:34:29.341
Thank you.

01:34:52.308 --> 01:34:54.242
Yes.

01:35:00.616 --> 01:35:02.379
Well...

01:35:02.418 --> 01:35:04.579
I think we might have a chance.

01:35:05.788 --> 01:35:09.417
That doctor in the white coat
said to us, ''The race is run.''

01:35:09.525 --> 01:35:11.356
He didn't say the same as you.

01:35:11.894 --> 01:35:14.761
That was earlier in the night.
She's hanging on.

01:35:17.900 --> 01:35:21.336
You're not thinking
she'd be better gone, Doctor?

01:35:21.371 --> 01:35:24.033
No, I'm not. I'm certainly not.

01:35:24.073 --> 01:35:26.598
Doctors often say that, don't they?

01:35:27.643 --> 01:35:31.773
She might pull through.
Surely, that would be best.

01:35:31.814 --> 01:35:33.975
But if she couldn't move?

01:35:36.919 --> 01:35:39.820
People can manage on very little.

01:35:39.856 --> 01:35:42.518
There's a chance. That's what he's saying.

01:36:47.723 --> 01:36:50.749
I think I'd give her
100 milligrams of pethidine.

01:36:51.794 --> 01:36:54.092
All right.

01:36:54.130 --> 01:36:55.791
OK.

01:37:27.263 --> 01:37:30.323
It's late. Poor old Daniel.

01:37:30.366 --> 01:37:32.596
I've been at hospital.

01:37:33.803 --> 01:37:36.397
- Be all right, will he?
- She.

01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:39.601
She might just pull through.

01:37:42.245 --> 01:37:44.736
It's much better now you're awake.

01:37:47.183 --> 01:37:49.276
How was the Bar Mitzvah?

01:37:50.319 --> 01:37:51.980
OK.

01:37:54.457 --> 01:37:58.291
You take a lot of trouble
with your family, don't you?

01:38:07.637 --> 01:38:11.129
You know, we should have
seen Italy together.

01:38:15.645 --> 01:38:17.636
I shall miss you.

01:38:20.483 --> 01:38:22.917
I wonder if you'll miss either of us.

01:38:25.555 --> 01:38:27.887
I'll be back.

01:38:30.526 --> 01:38:32.517
Sometime.

01:39:03.926 --> 01:39:07.555
1,500 lira to the pound.

01:39:12.101 --> 01:39:14.092
Sign here, please.

01:39:15.037 --> 01:39:17.301
Where is the nearest post office?

01:39:33.489 --> 01:39:35.480
Turn left.

01:39:39.829 --> 01:39:41.990
And take the...

01:40:23.606 --> 01:40:27.542
- When are you off to Italy?
- On the 21st, God willing.

01:40:27.576 --> 01:40:30.272
- You going with Bob?
- I don't think so.

01:40:36.252 --> 01:40:39.187
We always thought we should try
to be a bit more grown-up

01:40:39.221 --> 01:40:42.156
about having holidays on our own.

01:40:42.191 --> 01:40:44.182
Separately, I mean.

01:40:45.094 --> 01:40:48.461
Have you ever thought of one
of those scholars' cruises?

01:40:48.497 --> 01:40:50.624
Alva nearly went on one.

01:40:50.666 --> 01:40:52.827
It isn't what I'd have chosen.

01:40:58.441 --> 01:41:00.466
I'm terribly sorry.

01:41:01.510 --> 01:41:03.637
No need.

01:41:05.681 --> 01:41:07.672
Eat your meat.

01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:13.150
- Bye, Daniel.
- Bye.

01:41:45.955 --> 01:41:48.924
I didn't know you would be here today.
I'm sorry.

01:41:48.958 --> 01:41:51.051
Thank you for not coming in.

01:41:51.093 --> 01:41:54.119
You must have been out here for...
You had lunch?

01:41:54.163 --> 01:41:56.495
No. I'm ravenous.

01:41:58.868 --> 01:42:02.167
- He's all right, is he?
- I think so.

01:42:06.809 --> 01:42:09.141
This isn't very easy, is it?

01:42:18.721 --> 01:42:20.712
I thought he'd be with you today.

01:42:21.457 --> 01:42:23.925
He's gone away, yes?

01:42:25.728 --> 01:42:29.425
I'm sorry. I only heard it from
the answering service.

01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:40.732
- You're welcome to them today.
- Thank you.

01:44:25.447 --> 01:44:29.645
I said that I preferred
my scampi without garlic

01:44:29.685 --> 01:44:32.518
and my wife would have liked a steak,

01:44:32.554 --> 01:44:35.045
provided that the meat was first-class.

01:45:28.077 --> 01:45:29.738
No.

01:45:41.523 --> 01:45:43.514
Bugger the conditional.

01:45:45.928 --> 01:45:49.694
When you're at school
and you want to quit,

01:45:49.732 --> 01:45:53.634
people say, ''You're going to hate it
out in the worId.''

01:45:55.337 --> 01:45:57.931
I didn't believe them and I was right.

01:45:59.775 --> 01:46:03.609
When I was a kid,
I couldn't wait to be grown-up.

01:46:05.180 --> 01:46:09.207
They said childhood
is the best time of your life but it wasn't.

01:46:11.253 --> 01:46:16.088
And now I want his company
and they say,

01:46:16.125 --> 01:46:20.255
''What's half a loaf?
You're well shot of him.''

01:46:20.295 --> 01:46:22.786
And I say, ''I know that.

01:46:25.267 --> 01:46:28.327
''But I miss him, that's all.''

01:46:29.872 --> 01:46:32.568
And they say,
''He never made you happy,''

01:46:32.608 --> 01:46:36.908
and I say, ''But I am happy,
apart from missing him.''

01:46:39.448 --> 01:46:42.611
You might throw me
a pill or two for my cough.

01:46:45.888 --> 01:46:50.882
All my life I've been looking
for somebody courageous, resourceful.

01:46:53.028 --> 01:46:55.019
He's not it.

01:46:56.231 --> 01:46:58.290
But something.

01:46:59.568 --> 01:47:01.559
We were something.

01:47:04.740 --> 01:47:07.140
I only came about my cough.
