00:06.340 --> 00:06.507
.

00:06.540 --> 00:07.441
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:08.742 --> 00:10.344
sexually based offenses

00:10.378 --> 00:12.180
are considered
especially heinous.

00:12.213 --> 00:14.248
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.282 --> 00:16.117
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.150 --> 00:17.485
are members of an elite squad

00:17.518 --> 00:19.553
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.587 --> 00:22.156
These are their stories.

00:22.623 --> 00:26.427
- In my younger
and more vulnerable years,

00:26.460 --> 00:31.699
when I was knee-deep
in my very first trial,

00:31.732 --> 00:36.470
opposing counsel unwittingly
sabotaged his own case

00:36.504 --> 00:39.840
by including
an inculpatory document

00:39.873 --> 00:43.244
in with his discovery request.

00:43.277 --> 00:45.546
I didn't know what to do.

00:45.579 --> 00:52.620
So I did what any young ADA
did when he was utterly lost.

00:52.653 --> 00:56.290
I went to Mr. Stone's cubicle

00:56.324 --> 00:59.260
where he was writing a closing.

00:59.293 --> 01:01.129
Ben listened patiently.

01:01.162 --> 01:04.665
"I can either ignore,"
I said, "or--"

01:04.698 --> 01:08.169
And he cut me off before
I could finish the sentence.

01:08.202 --> 01:10.504
"A man shouldn't do
what he can," he said.

01:10.538 --> 01:13.674
"He should do what he must,
without regard for consequence

01:13.707 --> 01:15.643
"or repercussion.

01:15.676 --> 01:20.181
That's what makes us moral,"
Ben added.

01:20.214 --> 01:24.118
"And God help us
if we lose that."

01:24.152 --> 01:28.856
So, like that, the world
is a sadder place.

01:28.889 --> 01:33.527
The noblest of hearts
has cracked.

01:33.561 --> 01:36.730
Goodbye, Ben Stone.

01:36.764 --> 01:42.503
And flights of angels
sing thee to thy rest.

01:47.908 --> 01:53.547
- Thank you,
District Attorney McCoy.

01:53.581 --> 01:59.119
If anyone else wishes
to speak...

02:16.537 --> 02:18.606
I can't wait to show you
this dress I bought.

02:18.639 --> 02:21.342
I'm scared it's
a little bit much.

02:23.511 --> 02:25.313
Sandy?

02:30.751 --> 02:32.386
Sandy!

02:44.298 --> 02:45.733
I live down the hall
with my parents.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.436
I babysit whenever
Maggie needs me to.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.538
I can't believe Aaron
would do this.

02:50.571 --> 02:53.907
- Now, did--did Aaron
say anything to you?

02:53.941 --> 02:56.810
- Just that he would kill me
if I screamed.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.379
He pointed a gun at me.

02:58.412 --> 03:00.314
I thought I was going to die.
- Okay.

03:00.348 --> 03:02.550
- You're gonna find Drew,
right?

03:02.583 --> 03:07.288
- We are gonna do the best
we can, okay, honey?

03:07.321 --> 03:08.489
Typical Tuesday afternoon.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.291
The mom goes out
to get her nails done,

03:10.324 --> 03:12.493
shopping, whatnot,
and the dad comes home early,

03:12.526 --> 03:15.429
and duct tapes the sitter,
shuts her in a closet,

03:15.463 --> 03:16.864
and then runs off
with ten-month-old, uh,

03:16.897 --> 03:18.366
baby Drew.

03:18.399 --> 03:20.000
- Uh, she's right here.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.469
Margaret Householder.

03:21.502 --> 03:23.371
Her friends call her Maggie.
- Okay.

03:23.404 --> 03:25.306
- Ok--okay, Mrs. Householder,

03:25.339 --> 03:26.874
this is my boss,
Lieutenant Benson.

03:26.907 --> 03:28.809
- Okay, how about--how about
we get you something to drink?

03:28.842 --> 03:30.811
- If you're not too busy,
I'd like you to find my son.

03:30.844 --> 03:32.880
- I assure you we will
do everything we can

03:32.913 --> 03:34.548
to find your son.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.984
We have been seeing a lot of--
of these sorts of cases.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.486
Familial kidnappings.

03:38.519 --> 03:40.554
But the good news is,
Mrs. Householder,

03:40.588 --> 03:43.357
that your husband will most
likely not hurt your son.

03:43.391 --> 03:44.825
- All due respect,
but you don't know

03:44.858 --> 03:45.993
a damn thing
about my son.

03:46.026 --> 03:47.461
It is only a matter of time

03:47.495 --> 03:51.699
before he cannot breathe
without that thing.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.467
We need to find him soon.

03:53.501 --> 03:55.336
This is an emergency!

03:55.369 --> 03:59.573
He's going to die,
Lieutenant.

04:06.414 --> 04:13.621
*

04:16.357 --> 04:23.531
*

04:27.735 --> 04:34.775
*

04:49.957 --> 04:50.324
.

04:50.358 --> 04:50.958
- When he was two months old,

04:52.460 --> 04:56.564
Aaron noticed that he was
struggling to breathe.

04:56.597 --> 04:59.667
It's called mitochondrial
DNA depletion syndrome.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.101
It's a genetic thing.

05:01.134 --> 05:05.373
It causes muscle weakness
that rapidly progresses.

05:05.406 --> 05:09.810
- So soon Drew won't
be able to breathe on his own.

05:09.843 --> 05:14.682
- I spend more time at Mercy
Hospital than I do at home.

05:14.715 --> 05:15.949
- Uh...

05:15.983 --> 05:18.986
Maggie, I just have to ask you,
were, um...

05:19.019 --> 05:23.757
Were you and Aaron
having any problems?

05:23.791 --> 05:27.528
- Not that I knew of.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.763
- Maggie, I know that
this doesn't help,

05:29.797 --> 05:33.133
and I hate myself
for even saying it,

05:33.166 --> 05:34.602
but, um...

05:34.635 --> 05:36.870
Have a seat.

05:36.904 --> 05:40.040
I have actually
been through this.

05:40.073 --> 05:41.909
My son was taken.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.811
- And you got him back.
- I did.

05:43.844 --> 05:46.580
Safe and sound.

05:48.181 --> 05:51.151
- The neighbor says he's sure
he saw Mr. Householder

05:51.184 --> 05:53.153
and the baby get
into a blue Toyota

05:53.186 --> 05:54.922
around 12:30 yesterday.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.857
- We don't have a car.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.626
- I'll check
the rental companies.

05:58.659 --> 06:01.629
- Okay.

06:01.662 --> 06:03.030
- Aaron Householder.

06:03.063 --> 06:04.665
- Like a year old.
- Okay, well, thank you.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.467
If anyone checks in fitting
that description...

06:06.500 --> 06:08.936
- 2535...That's right, 212.

06:08.969 --> 06:11.705
- All we know is he returned
a rental car to Sheepshead Bay.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.140
- Okay, so work backwards,

06:13.173 --> 06:15.075
looking for any calls he made
to Sheepshead Bay.

06:15.108 --> 06:16.710
- Already done.
Nothing in the past month.

06:16.744 --> 06:18.178
- And he didn't check
into any hotels or motels

06:18.211 --> 06:19.613
within a ten mile radius.

06:19.647 --> 06:21.114
- At least not using
his own name.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.583
- Nothing in
his office suggests

06:22.616 --> 06:23.984
that he wasn't
coming back.

06:24.017 --> 06:25.586
- Oh, here's something.

06:25.619 --> 06:28.188
Two weeks ago,
he charged about six grand

06:28.221 --> 06:29.790
to a medical supply store.

06:29.823 --> 06:32.526
- Two days ago.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.961
- Okay, well, you can't just
carry a ventilator

06:33.994 --> 06:35.529
onto a subway.

06:35.563 --> 06:36.930
- And the store doesn't open
till 10:00 a.m.

06:36.964 --> 06:40.100
- Okay, so track down
the manager.

06:41.669 --> 06:43.036
- Believe me,
it's not a problem.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.072
This business,
I get calls all hours.

06:45.105 --> 06:46.740
If there's anything wrong
with the ventilator--

06:46.774 --> 06:47.975
- No, it's nothing like that.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.076
- That's a relief.

06:49.109 --> 06:50.544
What was that name again?

06:50.578 --> 06:54.081
- Aaron Householder.
- That's right.

06:54.114 --> 06:56.550
All right, here we go.

06:56.584 --> 06:59.086
He bought the Kerry 2100.
Top of the line.

06:59.119 --> 07:01.088
- We did.

07:01.121 --> 07:03.190
201 East Sixth Street,
Sheepshead Bay.

07:03.223 --> 07:07.628
- You've been a big help,
Mr. Cooke.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.838
- I'm Lieutenant Benson.
- Okay, Lieutenant.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.840
- Ah, yeah, he's in there.
He's on the first floor.

07:19.873 --> 07:21.174
And he's not coming out.

07:21.208 --> 07:22.175
- He says he's okay.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.844
- At least he's talking.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.579
- It was hard to get him
to even turn his cell on.

07:25.613 --> 07:27.481
- The back door's bolted.
- Get him on the phone.

07:27.515 --> 07:30.718
- Yeah.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.520
- Yeah, Aaron,
it's me, it's Amanda.

07:32.553 --> 07:33.821
- There's so many of them.

07:33.854 --> 07:35.255
- I know, I know.
- Tell them to back off.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.725
- But, Aaron,
you know I can't do that.

07:37.758 --> 07:39.993
But my--my boss
Lieutenant Benson is here.

07:40.027 --> 07:43.196
She wants to talk with you.
- Okay.

07:43.230 --> 07:44.865
- Hey, Aaron.
- Detective Benson.

07:44.898 --> 07:47.735
- You know, why don't
you call me Olivia?

07:47.768 --> 07:50.003
- Uh, Olivia.

07:50.037 --> 07:52.005
- I spoke with--with Maggie.

07:52.039 --> 07:53.741
- Well--

07:53.774 --> 07:57.144
I gotta be honest with you,
Aaron, she's not doing great.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.246
- I didn't wanna hurt her.

07:59.279 --> 08:00.781
- Aaron, you took her baby.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.816
- I just wanna be alone
with my son.

08:02.850 --> 08:06.286
- Yeah, well, you know, some
days that's all I wanna do too,

08:06.319 --> 08:08.288
but unfortunately
the world just--

08:08.321 --> 08:10.157
It just doesn't work like that.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.892
- I got a shot.
- Okay, no, guns down.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.927
That's an order.

08:13.961 --> 08:16.029
Aaron?

08:16.063 --> 08:17.765
Aaron, listen to me.

08:17.798 --> 08:21.802
How about you let me
come in there, right?

08:21.835 --> 08:23.036
And you and I--

08:23.070 --> 08:25.038
I know that we can
figure this out.

08:25.072 --> 08:26.306
Face to face, okay?

08:26.339 --> 08:28.308
- The dude's got a gun.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.910
- Aaron.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.779
- I--

08:31.812 --> 08:33.180
- Okay, Aaron,
what do you say?

08:33.213 --> 08:34.247
- Okay, okay.

08:34.281 --> 08:35.783
You can come in, just you.

08:35.816 --> 08:38.218
And no weapons.

08:38.251 --> 08:41.589
- Not a problem.

08:41.622 --> 08:43.056
- Slowly.

08:43.090 --> 08:45.826
- Slowly.
Yes, okay.

08:48.095 --> 08:49.630
Okay, guys.

08:49.663 --> 08:53.266
- No, What do you think
you're doing, Liv?

08:55.135 --> 08:58.138
No, Liv, do not go in there.

08:58.171 --> 09:02.610
Liv!

09:02.643 --> 09:06.213
- Okay.

09:06.246 --> 09:09.182
I'm gonna take off my gloves.

09:09.216 --> 09:13.587
Okay?

09:33.073 --> 09:38.145
Aaron, I'm coming in.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.381
- You don't look like a cop.

09:41.414 --> 09:46.086
- Okay, well, I'll take that
as a compliment.

09:46.119 --> 09:47.855
Can I see Drew?
- He's sleeping.

09:47.888 --> 09:50.858
- I just wanna check
and see if he's okay.

09:50.891 --> 09:54.928
All right, nice and easy?

09:54.962 --> 09:56.263
Okay?

09:56.296 --> 09:59.933
Nice and easy.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.134
Aww.

10:01.168 --> 10:05.906
He's beautiful.

10:05.939 --> 10:09.643
Can we sit down?

10:09.677 --> 10:11.879
Okay.

10:15.916 --> 10:17.417
You wanna sit as well?

10:17.450 --> 10:20.954
You're the one with the gun.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.393
Much better, right?
Just--

10:26.426 --> 10:29.262
Just two adults talking.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.136
- Noah.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.338
He's five.

10:38.371 --> 10:41.909
- I bet he--
I bet he loves baseball.

10:41.942 --> 10:46.814
I bet he and his dad go
to the park and play catch.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.716
See?

10:48.749 --> 10:52.285
Drew is going to love baseball.

10:52.319 --> 10:57.190
And we're--we're gonna
go to Yankee Stadium.

10:57.224 --> 10:58.892
And why us?

10:58.926 --> 11:01.328
It's a one
in 10 million chance.

11:01.361 --> 11:02.796
What did we do wrong?

11:02.830 --> 11:04.765
You don't think
that I'm a good father.

11:04.798 --> 11:07.000
- I don't--I don't know you.

11:07.034 --> 11:09.102
The only thing that
I have to go on

11:09.136 --> 11:11.004
is that you
ran off with Drew.

11:11.038 --> 11:12.706
- It's not against the law.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.241
- It is if you kept him
from his mother.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.409
- She doesn't want him.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.846
- I talked to Maggie, Aaron.

11:18.879 --> 11:21.248
And she--
she wants him very much.

11:21.281 --> 11:22.482
You know, I think
that we should go now.

11:22.515 --> 11:23.951
What do you--

11:23.984 --> 11:26.086
Stay where you are.

11:26.119 --> 11:29.790
I said--I said--stop!

11:29.823 --> 11:31.358
- Oh, well,
what're you gonna do?

11:31.391 --> 11:35.095
- I'll shoot.

11:35.128 --> 11:39.232
- I'm a cop, Aaron.
I know you're not a killer.

11:39.266 --> 11:43.170
And I know a paintball gun
when I see it.

11:52.880 --> 11:56.083
You don't know
what you're doing.

11:56.116 --> 12:01.354
She wants to kill Drew.

12:05.025 --> 12:08.028
- Come on.

12:13.801 --> 12:13.967
.

12:14.001 --> 12:15.168
- It's not like I was going to
hold a pillow over his mouth.

12:17.805 --> 12:19.239
The doctors have humane ways.

12:19.272 --> 12:20.841
We were waiting
for a court order.

12:20.874 --> 12:23.310
- To kill your son.

12:23.343 --> 12:24.978
- To end his suffering.

12:25.012 --> 12:27.047
- And you didn't think to
tell us about any of this?

12:27.080 --> 12:28.515
- I wanted you to find him.

12:28.548 --> 12:30.183
- I feel like
I'm chasing my tail.

12:30.217 --> 12:32.285
- Mrs. Householder, try to see
this from our point of view.

12:32.319 --> 12:34.121
- You think
I'm a terrible person.

12:34.154 --> 12:35.989
- I don't know you
well enough to judge.

12:36.023 --> 12:39.159
- What kind of a mother
wants her son to die?

12:39.192 --> 12:40.794
- Tell me.

12:40.828 --> 12:43.530
- Every day that he lives,
his pain gets worse.

12:45.032 --> 12:46.934
- That there's nothing
they could do.

12:46.967 --> 12:51.271
That we can only watch him
suffer until--

12:51.304 --> 12:55.342
It is killing us, Mr. Barba.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.344
You're a lawyer.

12:57.377 --> 13:00.147
I thought that the law was
supposed to protect us.

13:00.180 --> 13:03.450
- It's also supposed
to protect Drew.

13:03.483 --> 13:05.352
- But it's hurting him.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.888
Day after day.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.556
- The law wants Drew dead.

13:09.589 --> 13:11.291
- Nobody wants Drew dead.

13:11.324 --> 13:12.492
- Maggie does.

13:12.525 --> 13:15.195
The doctors do.
Just wait.

13:15.228 --> 13:16.463
You'll see.

13:16.496 --> 13:19.399
Judge Wallace P. Rosen.

13:19.432 --> 13:23.170
He's gonna order us...

13:23.203 --> 13:26.606
To pull the plug.

13:27.908 --> 13:31.845
Tell me, Lieutenant.

13:31.879 --> 13:33.380
Is there a--

13:33.413 --> 13:37.517
a law out there that--
that entitles Drew to live?

13:37.550 --> 13:40.353
- It would be so easy if we--

13:47.227 --> 13:50.397
I filed a motion in court
to let me.

13:53.533 --> 13:59.039
Aaron opposed it, but he agreed
to do whatever the judge said.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.208
- Appears that Aaron
has changed his mind.

14:01.241 --> 14:03.443
- What if...

14:03.476 --> 14:04.945
They discover something?

14:04.978 --> 14:06.646
I mean,
it could happen.

14:06.679 --> 14:12.252
- I am not a horrible person,
Mr. Barba.

14:12.285 --> 14:18.291
If it wasn't
the only thing to do...

14:18.325 --> 14:24.564
His doctors say that
he has no brain activity.

14:24.597 --> 14:27.200
He is a lump of flesh.

14:27.234 --> 14:30.637
My beautiful lump of flesh,

14:30.670 --> 14:33.974
he should get the peace

14:34.007 --> 14:36.977
that we all deserve.

14:37.010 --> 14:40.047
He can't see.
He can't hear.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.115
I mean, go.
Go look at him.

14:42.149 --> 14:44.351
He is all but dead already.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.921
- You saw him.

14:47.955 --> 14:52.025
You can't tell me...

14:52.059 --> 14:54.361
That he's nothing.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.407
- Glad I'm not the judge.

15:07.440 --> 15:11.544
- Maybe I'll stay a cop.

15:11.578 --> 15:14.147
- It's not right that a guy
like that goes to prison.

15:14.181 --> 15:15.482
- Well, the law says it is.

15:15.515 --> 15:18.018
- Sometimes the law sucks.

15:18.051 --> 15:19.586
- I concur.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.154
- You think we should
lock him up?

15:22.255 --> 15:24.491
My dad always said he wasn't
scared of being dead,

15:24.524 --> 15:25.692
he was scared of dying.

15:25.725 --> 15:27.227
That kid is dying every day.

15:27.260 --> 15:30.563
He's taking his folks with him.

15:30.597 --> 15:33.633
- She wants to talk to him.

15:33.666 --> 15:37.070
- Come on.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.457
I just--
I couldn't.

15:57.490 --> 16:00.193
- I know.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.332
Aaron.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.280
- Christ.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.249
- Nobody's forcing you
to prosecute.

16:22.282 --> 16:25.018
- If I don't,
I'm telling the world

16:25.052 --> 16:26.586
that baby Drew
has no rights.

16:28.421 --> 16:31.624
- Unfortunately,
that's not in the Constitution.

16:31.658 --> 16:34.394
- Okay, uh, let's find out

16:34.427 --> 16:36.763
if daddy's little
excursion yesterday

16:36.796 --> 16:38.331
caused the baby any harm.

16:38.365 --> 16:42.569
- So you can let Aaron go
with a clear conscience.

16:42.602 --> 16:44.604
- So I can prosecute,
and maybe get some sleep

16:44.637 --> 16:48.541
in the next decade or so.

16:53.380 --> 16:53.546
.

16:53.580 --> 16:54.314
- Oh, I was just coming
to say hi.

16:55.548 --> 17:00.253
- My first wife made me promise

17:00.287 --> 17:01.454
to never eat at my desk.

17:01.488 --> 17:03.690
I thought it was good advice.

17:03.723 --> 17:05.558
Sit.

17:05.592 --> 17:07.694
- I just wanted to thank you
for your kind words yesterday.

17:07.727 --> 17:11.064
- All of them true.
All of them heartfelt.

17:11.098 --> 17:15.368
Sit.

17:15.402 --> 17:18.238
Eat.
- I'm good.

17:18.271 --> 17:19.672
- This is still my jurisdiction

17:19.706 --> 17:24.577
and people do what I say
or they pay the price.

17:24.611 --> 17:27.147
It was a wonderful service.

17:27.180 --> 17:28.715
Although I did think it was odd

17:28.748 --> 17:32.085
that none of your dad's
family members spoke.

17:32.119 --> 17:34.454
- I'm the only
family member left.

17:34.487 --> 17:38.558
- Res ipsa loquitur.

17:40.627 --> 17:42.429
- We didn't speak that much
when he was alive,

17:42.462 --> 17:44.831
so I figured, what good
will it do now?

17:44.864 --> 17:48.168
- It must've been tough
growing up with Saint Ben.

17:48.201 --> 17:51.604
- A great man is not
necessarily a good one.

17:51.638 --> 17:55.108
- Did you know that he had
everybody over to his place

17:55.142 --> 17:56.576
the first time you pitched?

17:56.609 --> 17:58.711
I thought his heart stopped

17:58.745 --> 18:01.514
when that bastard
ruined your no-hitter.

18:01.548 --> 18:04.217
I think he secretly
became a Cubs fan.

18:05.918 --> 18:09.889
That's treason.
- That's what I told him.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.259
He had the Chicago Law Journal

18:12.292 --> 18:15.628
delivered to his desk
every day.

18:15.662 --> 18:18.831
He scoured it
looking for your name.

18:21.468 --> 18:24.103
- I wish he would've
said something.

18:25.572 --> 18:28.675
- There's always a spot here
for you, Peter.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.510
- I appreciate that,
but I'm only staying

18:30.543 --> 18:34.481
long enough to settle
my dad's affairs.

18:34.514 --> 18:36.449
- You give Mark Jefferies
my best,

18:36.483 --> 18:40.587
and tell him
we still have better hot dogs.

18:46.259 --> 18:53.433
*

18:59.272 --> 19:01.441
- Huh.

19:36.376 --> 19:40.980
- We don't pay you to think,
we pay you to work.

19:41.013 --> 19:44.384
Sure, I'll have one.

19:44.417 --> 19:48.221
You know, I always wish the law
was more like chemistry.

19:49.722 --> 19:52.759
You heat up water
to 212 degrees,

19:52.792 --> 19:55.562
and the son of a bitch boils.

19:55.595 --> 19:57.997
- Sans bias, sans judgment.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.600
- Sans conscience.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.602
So what's so interesting out
that window?

20:02.635 --> 20:06.739
- My father...

20:06.773 --> 20:09.576
Almost seven years ago,
Dad went into a diabetic coma,

20:09.609 --> 20:13.580
and he was on life support
for six weeks.

20:13.613 --> 20:15.882
- Ah, I'm sorry.
- No, don't be.

20:15.915 --> 20:18.551
He was not well-liked.
By anyone.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.253
Especially me.

20:20.287 --> 20:23.623
Still, I was at the hospital
every morning before work,

20:23.656 --> 20:26.459
and every night,
until the nurses threw me out.

20:26.493 --> 20:29.429
The doctors said that there was
nothing they could do for him.

20:29.462 --> 20:30.997
There was no brain activity.

20:31.030 --> 20:33.500
They highly recommended
that we end it.

20:33.533 --> 20:37.437
And I said, "No.

20:37.470 --> 20:41.641
Where there's life,
there's hope."

20:41.674 --> 20:44.611
I could've eased his suffering,
but I didn't.

20:44.644 --> 20:45.912
And I told myself
that it's because

20:45.945 --> 20:47.747
Father Mike
wouldn't approve.

20:47.780 --> 20:52.619
- I'm sure he wouldn't.
- I was selfish.

20:52.652 --> 20:55.788
I hated the man.

20:55.822 --> 20:58.858
But still,
I didn't want the burden

20:58.891 --> 21:01.294
of being the reason that
he took his last breath.

21:01.328 --> 21:03.430
I was selfish.

21:03.463 --> 21:07.900
I let him suffer.

21:07.934 --> 21:11.971
- Prosecute Aaron Householder.

21:12.004 --> 21:14.073
- For doing the same thing
that I did to my dad?

21:14.106 --> 21:18.511
- The law is what
the statute says it is.

21:18.545 --> 21:20.012
- It's a shame.

21:20.046 --> 21:24.917
No matter how hard we try,
we can't legislate morality.

21:24.951 --> 21:29.756
- We're not in the
compassion business, Rafael.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.894
- Sure.

21:34.927 --> 21:38.030
Why not?

21:43.670 --> 21:45.405
- Cut a deal.

21:45.438 --> 21:47.574
Offer him probation.

21:47.607 --> 21:49.041
Go to church.

21:49.075 --> 21:51.778
Say three Hail Marys.

21:51.811 --> 21:55.382
Then come back here
and finish off that bottle.

22:04.724 --> 22:11.898
*

22:16.035 --> 22:17.770
- I thought Aaron
would be here.

22:17.804 --> 22:22.041
- Uh, he just went out
for coffee.

22:28.648 --> 22:30.750
I love to just look at him.

22:30.783 --> 22:33.686
- He's beautiful.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.388
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

22:35.422 --> 22:37.790
- He is.

22:37.824 --> 22:39.892
We heard from the judge today.

22:39.926 --> 22:43.830
He's withholding his decision
until a guardian ad litem

22:43.863 --> 22:45.998
can be appointed
to represent Drew's interests.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.534
- That can happen quickly.

22:47.567 --> 22:48.801
- It won't.

22:48.835 --> 22:51.471
Nobody wants
to make a decision.

22:51.504 --> 22:53.940
They all just pass the buck.

22:53.973 --> 22:55.842
Doctors ask us,
we ask the judge,

22:55.875 --> 22:57.510
the judge waits
for the guardian,

22:57.544 --> 22:59.011
and then Aaron will object,

22:59.045 --> 23:01.514
and we'll just keep on waiting.

23:01.548 --> 23:05.918
Meanwhile Drew lies here with
a machine keeping him alive.

23:05.952 --> 23:09.456
Did I tell you he needs
the ventilator to breathe now?

23:09.489 --> 23:12.158
For the rest of his life.

23:12.191 --> 23:14.026
- I'm sorry.

23:14.060 --> 23:17.830
- God, if I could just--

23:17.864 --> 23:21.167
know what was going on
in there.

23:21.200 --> 23:24.804
Sometimes, when I can't sleep,
I--

23:24.837 --> 23:29.842
I try to imagine not thinking.

23:31.177 --> 23:33.546
God.

23:33.580 --> 23:35.214
All he knows is pain.

23:35.247 --> 23:38.117
So wrong, Mr. Barba.

23:40.953 --> 23:44.891
- I'm going to offer
Aaron probation.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.636
- When I was
five months pregnant,

23:56.669 --> 23:58.037
the doctors said that there was

23:58.070 --> 23:59.906
a good chance that
he would be like this.

23:59.939 --> 24:02.241
- Don't do this to yourself,
Maggie.

24:02.274 --> 24:04.210
- Aaron, um, wanted me
to get an abortion,

24:04.243 --> 24:09.882
and I was the one who said that
we should take our chances.

24:09.916 --> 24:12.852
Wasn't I the brave one?

24:12.885 --> 24:16.723
What chance did I take?

24:16.756 --> 24:18.157
I did the righteous thing,

24:18.190 --> 24:21.694
and my baby has to do
all of the suffering.

24:21.728 --> 24:23.162
- You should not
judge yourself.

24:25.865 --> 24:29.001
He can't breathe
without a machine.

24:29.035 --> 24:32.605
He can't eat without tubes.

24:32.639 --> 24:34.841
He can't see.
He can't hear.

24:34.874 --> 24:37.910
And I could've prevented that,

24:37.944 --> 24:41.581
and I chose to be righteous.

24:43.916 --> 24:46.619
Why?
Why can't he just die?

24:46.653 --> 24:50.957
Why?

24:57.263 --> 25:01.500
- He can.

25:20.219 --> 25:24.624
- [exhales deeply,
sniffles]

25:55.688 --> 25:56.956
- Okay, okay.

25:56.989 --> 26:01.193
All right, all right,
okay, okay, okay.

26:01.227 --> 26:03.830
Oh, God.

26:05.932 --> 26:09.335
- Maggie.
Maggie, you should go.

26:10.837 --> 26:15.041
- I can't leave him.

26:15.074 --> 26:18.911
- Maggie, go.

26:18.945 --> 26:22.381
Go, please.

27:31.851 --> 27:32.018
.

27:34.153 --> 27:39.091
- I don't want coffee.

27:39.125 --> 27:40.326
You killed the baby?

27:40.359 --> 27:42.929
- I expedited his passing.

27:42.962 --> 27:44.931
- That's gonna be a tough hair
to split in a courtroom.

27:44.964 --> 27:46.332
- The courtroom's the last
thing I was thinking of

27:46.365 --> 27:49.736
when I was
in that hospital room.

27:51.804 --> 27:54.140
- You could go to prison.

27:54.173 --> 27:55.441
Sometimes you have to act

27:55.474 --> 27:56.909
without concern
for the consequences.

27:56.943 --> 27:58.210
- Not you.

27:58.244 --> 28:02.749
You wear suspenders and a belt.

28:02.782 --> 28:05.985
- I had no option.

28:08.187 --> 28:10.222
I gotta fix this.

28:10.256 --> 28:13.125
- Liv.
Liv!

28:13.159 --> 28:16.729
Liv, you can't help me.

28:19.231 --> 28:22.134
- Mr. McCoy, hi.

28:22.168 --> 28:24.971
- Colleagues get to call me
Jack, Lieutenant.

28:25.004 --> 28:26.839
File the motion.

28:26.873 --> 28:31.978
I suppose you wanna talk to me
about ADA Barba.

28:32.011 --> 28:35.314
- He's the best ADA
that I've ever worked with.

28:35.347 --> 28:38.284
He is honest and honorable.

28:38.317 --> 28:41.353
- But I can't have my ADAs
running around killing people.

28:41.387 --> 28:45.457
It's unbecoming.

28:45.491 --> 28:49.461
- He did what
he thought was right.

28:49.495 --> 28:52.364
- I know that.

28:52.398 --> 28:55.802
You know that.
- Yes, I do.

28:55.835 --> 28:58.204
- Let's hope
the jury agrees with us.

28:58.237 --> 29:01.473
Oh, here comes my dinner date.

29:01.507 --> 29:02.975
Lieutenant Benson,

29:03.009 --> 29:05.277
say hello to Peter Stone.

29:05.311 --> 29:06.946
He's the hotshot out of Chicago

29:06.979 --> 29:10.349
who's going to be
special counsel

29:10.382 --> 29:14.787
in the People v. Rafael Barba.

29:17.489 --> 29:21.894
It's a pleasure.

29:25.431 --> 29:28.500
- I sure hope you suck.

29:38.277 --> 29:41.580
- Hey, Jack.

29:41.613 --> 29:45.017
How'd you know
I was gonna say yes?

29:45.051 --> 29:47.286
- Because...

29:47.319 --> 29:51.490
You have more of your father
in you than you know.

30:00.967 --> 30:02.434
- I have to admit,

30:02.468 --> 30:04.937
I thought my surprise quotient
was filled for the year

30:04.971 --> 30:06.839
when McAdoo benched Manning.

30:06.873 --> 30:08.841
But this, I gotta tell you,

30:08.875 --> 30:10.609
on the all-time scale
is up there

30:10.642 --> 30:12.611
between Bucky Dent
and Charlie Rose.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.213
- If you don't wanna
represent me, that's okay.

30:14.246 --> 30:16.983
- I don't wanna represent you,
I have to represent you.

30:17.016 --> 30:19.852
Cases like this wet my whistle,
so to speak.

30:19.886 --> 30:22.588
So, what did the little bastard
do to you?

30:22.621 --> 30:24.556
- This was a mistake.
- Okay, okay.

30:24.590 --> 30:26.558
I'll skip the whole
self-defense angle.

30:26.592 --> 30:28.194
- I'm sorry I wasted your time,
Mr. Dworkin.

30:28.227 --> 30:29.195
- Randy.

30:29.228 --> 30:32.098
And my point is this whole
thing is a sick joke.

30:32.131 --> 30:34.500
You killed something that
nine out of ten doctors

30:34.533 --> 30:36.468
would say wasn't alive.

30:38.637 --> 30:41.273
- Look, you wanna
prove a point,

30:41.307 --> 30:42.942
and I wanna prove a point.

30:42.975 --> 30:45.945
It's what my nana would call
the perfect shidduch.

30:47.079 --> 30:48.447
- What point
do you wanna prove?

30:48.480 --> 30:51.517
- That the government's power
has grown too damn much.

30:51.550 --> 30:52.985
That the bigger
the government gets,

30:53.019 --> 30:54.386
the smaller
it leaves the individual.

30:54.420 --> 30:56.522
That once the government takes
away our right to die,

30:56.555 --> 30:58.257
it takes away
our right to live.

30:58.290 --> 31:00.326
How am I doing so far?

31:07.699 --> 31:09.301
- When he had
trouble breathing,

31:09.335 --> 31:11.938
our pediatrician sent us
to Dr. Vacarro.

31:13.439 --> 31:15.474
- He said that it was bad,
but that there were

31:15.507 --> 31:18.244
some doctors somewhere doing
experiments with stem cells.

31:18.277 --> 31:19.946
He said the results
were promising.

31:19.979 --> 31:21.680
- In other words,
he gave you hope.

31:21.713 --> 31:23.215
- That was enough.

31:23.249 --> 31:26.318
- There was no hope.
Drew was already dead.

31:26.352 --> 31:31.357
He couldn't see or hear
or breathe or think.

31:31.390 --> 31:34.893
That is dead.

31:36.462 --> 31:38.597
- I'm terribly sorry for
your loss, Mrs. Householder.

31:39.731 --> 31:42.168
- Because the law says I must.

31:42.201 --> 31:44.436
Do you recognize this document,
Mrs. Householder?

31:44.470 --> 31:46.372
- Looks like a report
from Dr. Mitchell.

31:46.405 --> 31:48.107
She was my OBGYN.

31:48.140 --> 31:51.343
- Please read
the highlighted portion.

31:53.545 --> 31:55.681
- "The patient has been
informed of both the likelihood

31:55.714 --> 31:57.716
"that her child might
develop MDDS

31:57.749 --> 32:01.720
and the consequences thereof."

32:01.753 --> 32:05.524
- Please continue reading,
Mrs. Householder.

32:05.557 --> 32:07.326
- "In spite of being
so informed,

32:07.359 --> 32:10.196
the patient has refused
to end the pregnancy."

32:13.265 --> 32:15.467
- In other words, you knew
your child would have MDDS.

32:15.501 --> 32:20.072
And yet you still refused
to have an abortion.

32:22.641 --> 32:27.046
- Yes.

32:29.248 --> 32:31.583
- I couldn't.

32:36.188 --> 32:38.524
- I couldn't kill my baby.

32:45.231 --> 32:47.199
- Yes.

32:47.233 --> 32:48.734
- So it was wrong to kill Drew

32:48.767 --> 32:50.402
when you were
five months pregnant,

32:50.436 --> 32:52.238
but it's okay to kill him
ten months after he was born?

32:52.271 --> 32:57.676
Is that what you're saying?

33:01.547 --> 33:03.249
- Lieutenant.

33:03.282 --> 33:05.217
- Have you spoken
to Rafael Barba?

33:05.251 --> 33:06.552
- Actually,
the law says I can't.

33:06.585 --> 33:08.220
- Look, forget the law
for a minute.

33:08.254 --> 33:11.390
Look into his eyes,
talk to him.

33:11.423 --> 33:14.493
That man lives in a place
that the men who wrote the law

33:14.526 --> 33:16.228
don't even think about.

33:16.262 --> 33:18.097
- Well, down here
amongst us mere mortals,

33:18.130 --> 33:19.465
he's a Class A felon.

33:19.498 --> 33:21.367
- No, I don't.

33:21.400 --> 33:24.136
- Yeah, well,
their pain is your pain.

33:24.170 --> 33:25.404
Rafael knows that.

33:25.437 --> 33:27.639
- Look, I know exactly
why he did what he did.

33:27.673 --> 33:29.475
And I understand completely.

33:30.709 --> 33:33.212
- So if we as a society
ignore it,

33:33.245 --> 33:35.614
we are saying that murder
is no longer absolutely wrong.

33:35.647 --> 33:37.149
Condoning it in one case

33:37.183 --> 33:38.250
would allow us
to condone it in any case,

33:38.284 --> 33:40.086
and that would
be capricious.

33:40.119 --> 33:44.456
- I'm talking about a decent
man who did a decent thing.

33:44.490 --> 33:47.126
- They shoot horses,
Lieutenant, not people.

33:47.159 --> 33:49.461
What if little Drew
didn't have MDDS?

33:49.495 --> 33:51.130
What if he had Down Syndrome?

33:51.163 --> 33:52.831
Or Leukemia?
Or a sore throat?

33:52.864 --> 33:54.166
What if he didn't have
physical pain at all?

33:54.200 --> 33:55.434
What if he was just unhappy?

33:55.467 --> 33:57.203
- That's the thing
about you lawyers.

33:57.236 --> 34:01.173
You're always talking
about the reasonable man.

34:01.207 --> 34:03.409
Let me tell you something.

34:03.442 --> 34:07.813
You wouldn't know a reasonable
man if he fell out of the sky

34:07.846 --> 34:11.317
and he landed at your feet.

34:19.391 --> 34:19.558
.

34:19.591 --> 34:21.327
- I worked in the DA's office
for 21 years.

34:21.360 --> 34:22.261
- Mr. Barba, is it fair to say
that you spent

34:23.729 --> 34:27.766
your entire professional life
practicing law?

34:27.799 --> 34:28.834
- Yes.

34:28.867 --> 34:30.469
- That's correct.

34:30.502 --> 34:31.870
- Putting those who violate
the law behind bars?

34:31.903 --> 34:33.305
- Yes.

34:33.339 --> 34:37.376
- Murder is against the law.
Is it not?

34:37.409 --> 34:38.710
- It is.

34:41.347 --> 34:43.582
- I don't believe
that what I did was murder.

34:43.615 --> 34:46.185
- But when you went into Drew
Householder's hospital room

34:46.218 --> 34:48.187
he was alive.
When you came out, he was dead.

34:48.220 --> 34:49.655
Somebody did something.

34:49.688 --> 34:51.323
- Yes, I killed him.

34:51.357 --> 34:53.725
Um, but what I did, I don't
believe that it was murder.

34:53.759 --> 34:55.327
- I'm starting to feel like

34:55.361 --> 34:56.895
we're walking
a razor's edge here, Mr. Barba.

34:56.928 --> 34:59.131
- It was
a justifiable homicide.

34:59.165 --> 35:03.635
- In other words,
you had to do it?

35:03.669 --> 35:08.307
- There were these, um,
flowers on the table,

35:08.340 --> 35:10.476
next to Drew's crib.

35:10.509 --> 35:11.710
Orange roses.

35:11.743 --> 35:15.747
He would never know
how wonderful they are.

35:15.781 --> 35:18.717
He couldn't smell them.

35:18.750 --> 35:21.720
His mom was playing
one of Bach's cantatas,

35:21.753 --> 35:23.889
from her phone.

35:23.922 --> 35:27.759
The eternal Bach.

35:27.793 --> 35:31.363
Drew couldn't hear it.

35:31.397 --> 35:33.299
He'd never see a cloud.

35:33.332 --> 35:36.902
A rainbow.
Um, the sun.

35:36.935 --> 35:38.804
The moon.

35:38.837 --> 35:40.706
The bottom line is that
he would never even know

35:40.739 --> 35:42.908
that these things existed.

35:42.941 --> 35:44.710
He didn't know if
he was hungry or thirsty.

35:44.743 --> 35:46.945
He couldn't recognize the faces
of his mother or his father.

35:46.978 --> 35:48.480
All that he did know,

35:48.514 --> 35:50.316
all that he would ever know,
is the pain

35:50.349 --> 35:52.651
that was his so-called life.

35:54.586 --> 35:58.724
- The doctors say that his
brain had stopped functioning.

36:00.926 --> 36:02.528
- So to speak.

36:02.561 --> 36:04.930
- Surely, you,
as a man of the law,

36:04.963 --> 36:06.932
must be able to make a
distinction between who is dead

36:06.965 --> 36:08.567
and who's alive.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.636
- Courts have only dealt
with this issue tangentially.

36:10.669 --> 36:12.938
In Roe v. Wade,
the court implied

36:12.971 --> 36:14.706
that an unborn baby was alive

36:14.740 --> 36:17.343
when it could survive
on its own.

36:17.376 --> 36:18.944
- Could Drew Householder
survive without being

36:18.977 --> 36:20.412
hooked up
to all those machines?

36:20.446 --> 36:21.847
- His doctors say
that he could not.

36:21.880 --> 36:25.617
- So, in effect, the life
you took from Drew Householder

36:25.651 --> 36:28.520
wasn't really life
to begin with, was it?

36:28.554 --> 36:30.356
- Objection.

36:30.389 --> 36:31.590
- All I know is that
when I looked in his crib,

36:31.623 --> 36:34.993
I saw a baby
who couldn't form

36:35.026 --> 36:38.964
the most basic thought
of his own.

36:38.997 --> 36:41.433
He couldn't love.

36:41.467 --> 36:44.603
Or--or hate.
Or...

36:44.636 --> 36:46.372
Or hope.

36:46.405 --> 36:49.975
And when I saw the pain--
that--that--

36:50.008 --> 36:53.579
the unutterable suffering that
his existence was causing

36:53.612 --> 36:56.715
the two people
who loved him most,

36:56.748 --> 37:00.586
I had to do something...

37:00.619 --> 37:04.623
Whether that meant
going to prison or not.

37:14.533 --> 37:16.802
- Does Mrs. Householder
have sole custody of Drew?

37:16.835 --> 37:18.370
- Um, no.

37:18.404 --> 37:21.807
She, uh--she shares it
with Mr. Householder.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.342
- Did you confer with him

37:23.375 --> 37:28.280
before you hastened
the death of his son?

37:28.314 --> 37:32.250
- No.

37:36.855 --> 37:39.625
- Do you feel guilty
for what you've done?

37:39.658 --> 37:42.628
- Do you feel guilty
for what you're doing?

37:42.661 --> 37:47.533
- I'll ask again, do you feel
guilty for what you've done?

37:47.566 --> 37:49.735
- I did what
I thought was right.

37:49.768 --> 37:54.806
- Mr. Barba,
do you feel guilty, sir?

38:00.011 --> 38:02.981
- I do.

38:06.017 --> 38:13.425
*

38:27.706 --> 38:31.643
- Will the defendant
please rise?

38:31.677 --> 38:35.547
Have you reached a verdict?
- Yes, we have, your Honor.

38:40.452 --> 38:42.421
On the sole count
of the indictment,

38:42.454 --> 38:44.122
murder in the second degree,

38:44.155 --> 38:46.858
we find the defendant,
Rafael Barba...

38:49.795 --> 38:51.563
Not guilty.

38:51.597 --> 38:54.800
- Members of the jury,
you are excused.

38:54.833 --> 38:57.603
The court thanks you
for your service.

39:13.885 --> 39:16.622
- Well done.

39:23.194 --> 39:26.665
- You do realize half my job is
stopping people who work here

39:26.698 --> 39:28.434
from doing something stupid.

39:28.467 --> 39:31.102
- Well, now you have one less
person to worry about.

39:31.136 --> 39:32.871
- You don't have to do this,
Rafael.

39:32.904 --> 39:35.874
- I know.

39:37.576 --> 39:39.177
- Would it be unbearably corny
if I said,

39:39.210 --> 39:41.413
"I'm going to do
what I must"?

39:41.447 --> 39:44.950
- Yes, it would.

39:46.518 --> 39:48.820
But I understand.

40:16.214 --> 40:18.917
- I feel so guilty about this.

40:21.720 --> 40:27.125
- I called you about this case.

40:27.158 --> 40:28.794
- You--you know, when we first
started working together--

40:28.827 --> 40:33.131
what was it, five years ago?
- Six.

40:34.900 --> 40:37.703
The world was an old movie.
It was all black and white.

40:37.736 --> 40:39.938
And it was high noon.
I was Gary Cooper.

40:41.239 --> 40:43.875
- I was absolutely sure--
absolutely--

40:43.909 --> 40:46.244
who were the good guys,
who were the bad guys.

40:46.277 --> 40:48.814
And then you...

40:48.847 --> 40:52.551
You started to

40:52.584 --> 40:54.753
weasel your way into my world,

40:54.786 --> 40:59.725
and the black and white became
different shades of gray.

40:59.758 --> 41:01.527
Don't--

41:01.560 --> 41:02.828
Say it.

41:08.033 --> 41:09.868
Before I knew it,

41:09.901 --> 41:11.903
there were blues

41:11.937 --> 41:13.839
and greens

41:13.872 --> 41:17.976
and yellows
and reds.

41:18.009 --> 41:23.114
I'm you now, Liv.

41:23.148 --> 41:25.784
You opened my heart.

41:25.817 --> 41:29.888
And I thank you for it.

41:39.264 --> 41:43.635
- I've got to move on.

42:19.838 --> 42:20.005
.

42:22.941 --> 42:29.948
*
