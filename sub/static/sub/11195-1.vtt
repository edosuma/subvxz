00:07.758 --> 00:10.302
Previously on Stargate SG-1:

00:12.596 --> 00:15.224
They are the enemy of the Asgard.

00:15.307 --> 00:17.768
They plan to land the ship
and infest Earth.

00:18.060 --> 00:19.311
Can you transport us up?

00:19.436 --> 00:22.105
Anybody who comes up
is not gettin' down.

00:26.693 --> 00:29.071
Can this ship withstand
an uncontrolled re-entry?

00:29.196 --> 00:30.113
No.

00:33.116 --> 00:35.786
We must destroy it
by whatever means necessary.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.039
They're gonna use it to escape.

00:45.921 --> 00:47.339
Carter!

00:54.638 --> 00:57.099
And now the conclusion.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.373
(beeping)

01:34.970 --> 01:39.349
(speak Russian)

01:55.449 --> 01:57.492
(rattling)

02:01.538 --> 02:03.582
(tapping)

02:50.587 --> 02:52.214
(whirring and tapping)

03:06.687 --> 03:08.313
Agh!

04:26.225 --> 04:29.645
I hear it took longer than they thought
to set up the second gate.

04:29.728 --> 04:33.982
They finally got it running yesterday.
Technical difficulties or something.

04:34.066 --> 04:36.527
You needed Sam's help, huh?

04:37.736 --> 04:40.030
Yes. It's, uh...

04:41.156 --> 04:44.660
It's ironic that she's not here
to save herself.

04:44.785 --> 04:49.748
Well... you are fine.
There's no signs of residual infection.

04:49.832 --> 04:53.168
- You were very lucky.
- So you keep saying.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.337
I still want you to take it easy for...

04:55.462 --> 04:59.758
(PA) Offworld activation.
Repeat, we have an offworld activation.

04:59.842 --> 05:02.386
..another week.

05:02.469 --> 05:03.470
OK!

05:04.513 --> 05:07.307
Agh! Excuse me! Sorry! Ow!

05:07.391 --> 05:09.434
Hold that!

05:23.115 --> 05:27.244
- Receiving SG-1's IDC, sir.
- Open the iris.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.764
Well, it's about time!

05:50.350 --> 05:52.811
We've been dialling home
for over a week.

05:52.895 --> 05:55.439
It's great to see you guys, too.

05:56.273 --> 06:01.069
- I am pleased to see you well.
- Thank you, Teal'c. You've got a...

06:02.404 --> 06:04.781
(whispers) Don't touch it.

06:05.115 --> 06:08.619
- Glad you made it, SG-1 .
- Where's the fanfare, General?

06:08.744 --> 06:11.997
- We did kind of save the planet, sir.
- Again.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.374
It should not get old, General.

06:14.458 --> 06:17.711
- Job well done.
- Thank you, sir. It was nothing.

06:17.920 --> 06:21.590
- What happened to Thor?
- We got him out in a stasis pod.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.885
It was retrieved when we went
through the Stargate on P4X-234.

06:24.968 --> 06:26.845
It had a locating beacon.

06:26.929 --> 06:29.932
- They left you behind?
- We were fine, sir.

06:30.057 --> 06:35.395
I'd be happy to debrief you all after I've
debriefed myself for a nice hot shower.

06:35.479 --> 06:40.692
Permission to shower granted.
In fact, I insist on it, Colonel.

06:42.402 --> 06:45.656
- Bad?
- I wasn't gonna say anything.

07:05.551 --> 07:07.594
What you doin'?

07:07.719 --> 07:13.308
They salvaged a couple of replicator
pieces from the ocean. I'm having a look.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.230
Is that wise?

07:18.355 --> 07:22.484
There's no discernible energy being
emitted. It's safe to say they're dead.

07:22.568 --> 07:25.821
Besides, it's only a couple of little blocks.

07:25.946 --> 07:28.156
Well, I'm off.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.784
- Still going fishing?
- Yep.

07:31.952 --> 07:34.496
- Still stayin' here?
- Yeah.

07:34.580 --> 07:38.417
Think I've had enough
relaxation for a while, sir.

07:40.043 --> 07:42.588
- OK.
- Have fun.

07:43.839 --> 07:45.883
Yah sure, you betcha.

07:47.759 --> 07:49.803
(phone)

07:50.387 --> 07:52.431
Carter.

07:53.015 --> 07:55.225
Yes, sir.

08:01.190 --> 08:03.233
Sir! Wait.

08:06.528 --> 08:08.488
Deja vu.

08:08.614 --> 08:13.577
General Hammond just called. Major
Davis is on his way in from the Pentagon.

08:13.702 --> 08:16.580
- Not goin' fishin'?
- No, sir.

08:20.042 --> 08:21.585
Doh!

08:24.004 --> 08:29.760
The navy intercepted a Mayday
from the Foxtrot-class attack submarine.

08:29.885 --> 08:32.888
- That's Russian.
- Yes.

08:32.971 --> 08:35.265
Code name: Blackbird.

08:35.349 --> 08:39.895
The crew was being attacked
by a large mechanical spider.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.150
- Just one?
- We thought it was a joke.

08:45.234 --> 08:47.361
Then the transmission cut out.

08:47.444 --> 08:51.990
Approximately 1700 hours, the sub
was spotted by aircraft off the Nimitz.

08:52.074 --> 08:55.827
It had surfaced and none of the attempts
to communicate were returned.

08:55.911 --> 08:59.248
It was boarded. The crew was found dead.

08:59.498 --> 09:01.208
All of them?

09:01.291 --> 09:05.379
They got the bodies off before
they discovered how they died.

09:07.381 --> 09:08.382
That's them.

09:08.507 --> 09:11.677
Sir, if this started with one bug,
it's already replicating.

09:11.760 --> 09:14.221
The man that took the pictures
made it out.

09:14.304 --> 09:16.974
The Pentagon advised the navy
to tow the sub in.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.351
- Do the Russians know we have it?
- No.

09:19.434 --> 09:23.105
We're denying any knowledge,
but, uh... this is gonna get sticky.

09:23.188 --> 09:25.941
None of the replicators
must get out of that sub.

09:26.024 --> 09:30.904
It's under tight supervision. The harbour
has been entirely cordoned off.

09:30.988 --> 09:34.074
- Our cover story is a chemical spill.
- Blow it up.

09:34.449 --> 09:39.162
The Pentagon has requested that we
preserve some specimens for study.

09:39.913 --> 09:44.626
The Asgard tried that, and these buggers
have almost wiped out their entire race.

09:44.751 --> 09:49.047
That's why I'm here. You people are
the closest thing to experts we've got.

09:49.131 --> 09:54.011
- As an expert, I'm saying blow it up.
- Sir, conventional weapons may not do it.

09:54.136 --> 09:57.222
At least one survived
the destruction of Thor's ship.

09:57.472 --> 09:59.850
Fine. Tow it back out to sea and nuke it.

09:59.975 --> 10:02.519
We've considered that.

10:02.644 --> 10:05.105
We're in a political mess
right now, Colonel.

10:05.230 --> 10:09.401
The Russians picked up the Asgard ship's
entry into the atmosphere.

10:09.484 --> 10:12.738
- So?
- So, they're not buying our story.

10:12.821 --> 10:15.282
They already think we're responsible.

10:15.407 --> 10:19.328
A nuclear explosion in international
waters would be hard to cover up.

10:19.453 --> 10:22.164
You don't realise
how dangerous these things are.

10:22.247 --> 10:24.917
Is there any other way
to neutralise these things?

10:25.000 --> 10:27.544
Maybe alien technologies
you've come across?

10:27.669 --> 10:31.340
The replicators are impervious
to Goa'uld technology.

10:31.465 --> 10:36.094
They are, however, susceptible
to human projectile-weaponry.

10:38.555 --> 10:40.265
Guns.

10:40.390 --> 10:43.977
Sir, if there are still a small enough
number of the replicators,...

10:44.102 --> 10:47.856
- ..a properly equipped team could...
- Save the world?

10:48.273 --> 10:50.817
Getting old for you, sir?

10:53.111 --> 10:55.405
I'd better inform the Pentagon.

10:55.531 --> 11:00.827
- Unscheduled offworld activation.
- We have no teams currently off world.

11:25.811 --> 11:29.815
- Why isn't the iris closing?
- I'm trying, sir. It's not responding.

11:29.898 --> 11:33.151
- We have a loss of power in the base.
- What?

11:55.424 --> 11:57.885
That's Thor!

12:05.642 --> 12:07.603
Stand down.

12:07.686 --> 12:10.689
- Thor, buddy!
- Greetings, O'Neill.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.858
It's good to see you up and around.

12:12.983 --> 12:18.030
I owe you and your team a great
debt of gratitude for saving my life.

12:19.573 --> 12:22.409
Well, here's timing.

12:22.492 --> 12:27.289
Not all of the replicators were destroyed
when your ship exploded upon entry.

12:27.372 --> 12:29.917
Maybe you could help us out.

12:30.042 --> 12:33.378
- I cannot.
- Why?

12:33.587 --> 12:37.966
I have come by Stargate
because there are no ships to spare.

12:38.091 --> 12:41.428
My home world is being
threatened by the replicators.

12:41.553 --> 12:45.682
Thus far, all attempts
to stop them have failed.

12:45.766 --> 12:48.560
I have come here to seek your help.

13:02.074 --> 13:04.535
- We're back online, sir.
- Good.

13:05.327 --> 13:07.371
How can we help you?

13:07.496 --> 13:13.669
Your projectile weapons proved effective
in fatally damaging the replicators.

13:13.752 --> 13:14.753
Some.

13:14.878 --> 13:18.882
Your strategy for destroying
the Bilisknerwas successful.

13:18.966 --> 13:21.093
Yeah, but you guys...

13:21.218 --> 13:24.137
The Asgard have tried to stop them.

13:24.221 --> 13:30.310
You showed their weakness may be found
through a less sophisticated approach.

13:30.394 --> 13:33.272
We are no longer capable
of such thinking.

13:33.355 --> 13:38.735
Wait a minute. You're actually saying that
you need someone dumber than you are?

13:38.819 --> 13:41.780
You may have come to the right place.

13:44.157 --> 13:47.411
Thor, with all due respect,
we need SG-1 here.

13:47.703 --> 13:50.164
I could go, sir.

13:50.873 --> 13:54.459
I don't know, Carter.
You may not be dumb enough.

13:54.585 --> 13:58.088
- I think I can handle it, sir.
- Permission granted.

13:58.463 --> 14:01.466
We must leave immediately.

14:05.554 --> 14:08.974
- Have fun.
- Yah sure, you betcha.

14:33.081 --> 14:38.045
Simple recon, gentlemen.
Do not fire unless absolutely necessary.

14:38.128 --> 14:41.298
The replicators will not attack
unless threatened.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.675
Let's move.

14:51.600 --> 14:54.228
Video feed's up and online.

14:54.311 --> 14:57.105
Jack, can you hear me?

14:57.189 --> 15:02.778
Would it be necessary forme to mention
my insane aversion to bugs at this time?

15:24.466 --> 15:26.510
Wow!

15:28.345 --> 15:31.515
That's an impressive-looking ship.

15:33.350 --> 15:37.479
The O'Neill was supposed to be
our last great hope.

15:37.563 --> 15:39.606
The O'Neill?

15:39.731 --> 15:45.237
Yes. It is the most advanced
technological Asgard creation yet.

15:46.488 --> 15:52.494
It is the first Asgard vessel designed
solely to fight against the replicators.

15:52.578 --> 15:55.038
So why aren't we taking that?

15:56.165 --> 15:58.458
It is not ready.

15:59.459 --> 16:02.462
Uh... Where are we going exactly?

16:02.546 --> 16:08.385
Five Asgard ships are currently engaging
three ships controlled by the replicators,...

16:08.468 --> 16:10.929
..which are on their way here.

16:11.221 --> 16:15.767
We are going to join the battle
and, with your help, stop them.

16:18.604 --> 16:19.855
OK.

16:19.980 --> 16:23.901
For the sake of the Asgard,
we must not fail.

16:24.735 --> 16:27.696
No pressure(!)

18:57.721 --> 18:59.765
(whirring and tapping)

19:15.030 --> 19:17.074
Whoa!

19:27.543 --> 19:29.837
They're a different colour.

19:29.962 --> 19:32.631
Some sort of camouflage?

19:34.383 --> 19:36.426
We're movin' on.

20:05.372 --> 20:07.416
(tapping)

20:29.271 --> 20:31.315
What is that?

21:03.013 --> 21:05.474
That's a big one.

21:07.309 --> 21:11.855
If that's some sort of queen,
the other bugs may try to protect it.

21:11.939 --> 21:14.483
Queen?

21:23.909 --> 21:25.536
Agh!

21:30.749 --> 21:34.086
- Teal'c and Stevens are in trouble!
- Battery room.

22:09.413 --> 22:12.291
- Stevens?
- Dead.

22:12.833 --> 22:15.127
Let's move.

22:33.729 --> 22:36.982
(Thor) Each individual building block
is capable of exerting...

22:37.107 --> 22:42.529
..a reactive, modulating, monopolar
energy field on other blocks,...

22:42.613 --> 22:47.409
..allowing the replicators
to assemble themselves into many forms.

22:47.534 --> 22:52.331
To our knowledge, the interior
of each block contains the following:

22:52.873 --> 22:55.876
two million isolated kiron pathways...

22:56.001 --> 22:58.045
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

22:58.587 --> 23:01.298
What's a kiron?

23:01.381 --> 23:04.384
In simplest terms, it is an energy particle.

23:04.801 --> 23:09.431
- I... I've never even heard of it.
- Yes, I am aware.

23:10.599 --> 23:14.895
How am I supposed to help figure out
how to defeat a kiron-based technology...

23:14.978 --> 23:16.939
..if I don't know what a kiron is?

23:17.064 --> 23:23.153
We wouldn't invent a weapon that propels
small weights of iron and carbon alloys...

23:23.237 --> 23:28.867
..by igniting a powder of
potassium nitrate, charcoal and sulphur.

23:29.660 --> 23:33.580
- OK. I get your point.
- We cannot think like you.

23:36.250 --> 23:42.256
OK. Let's forget about the kirons and try
to put this in terms that I can understand.

23:42.381 --> 23:48.220
Each block is like an individual computer,
able to communicate with other blocks.

23:48.303 --> 23:51.807
Multiple blocks come together
to form bugs and other things...

23:51.890 --> 23:56.854
..in order to perform various tasks,
ultimately for the purpose of replicating.

23:56.937 --> 23:59.231
Correct.

24:00.566 --> 24:03.819
I guess you don't keep
any replicators around for study.

24:03.944 --> 24:06.572
It is too dangerous.

24:06.655 --> 24:10.325
Of course. That would be stupid.
Just out of curiosity,...

24:10.450 --> 24:15.914
..could, say... oh, I don't know...
two of the individual blocks replicate?

24:15.998 --> 24:21.044
It requires several blocks
working together to make new blocks.

24:21.170 --> 24:23.463
It's good to know.

24:30.596 --> 24:33.056
It's virtual?

24:35.434 --> 24:37.811
Wow, it looks real.

24:40.147 --> 24:42.191
Wow!

24:45.611 --> 24:49.448
It will simulate any behaviour
we have observed.

24:56.747 --> 25:00.751
It's outta control.
Nobody's goin' back down in there.

25:00.834 --> 25:04.421
We have to blow up the sub and hope to
contain any bugs that survive.

25:04.505 --> 25:08.091
- I think it's the only way.
- I'll talk to the Pentagon.

25:08.217 --> 25:10.260
Colonel!

25:14.473 --> 25:17.392
There is definitely something in here.

25:21.688 --> 25:24.358
I think you brought back a souvenir.

25:41.458 --> 25:44.545
What is your current thinking process?

25:45.295 --> 25:48.715
Sorry. My mind was wandering
for a second there.

25:49.132 --> 25:53.053
You were thinking about
the humans on your planet.

25:53.178 --> 25:55.222
Yes.

25:55.931 --> 26:00.811
- Colonel O'Neill is a very capable human.
- Yes, I know, but these things are...

26:00.894 --> 26:03.981
If we are able to stop
the invasion of my world,...

26:04.064 --> 26:07.818
..l promise we will do
all we can to help yours.

26:08.652 --> 26:11.363
That's a pretty big if.

26:12.990 --> 26:15.993
Would you like sustenance?

26:16.076 --> 26:18.453
Yes. Thank you. I'm starving.

26:24.418 --> 26:26.712
I like the yellow ones.

26:35.429 --> 26:37.639
Oh, my God!

26:40.559 --> 26:42.603
Sorry.

26:44.897 --> 26:47.357
(speaks Asgard language)

26:47.441 --> 26:50.235
What is it?

26:50.319 --> 26:56.074
We have lost contact with the rest of the
Asgard ships engaging the replicators.

26:56.575 --> 27:00.162
Well, could it be
a communication problem?

27:00.245 --> 27:04.082
No. The Asgard ships
are not being detected.

27:04.208 --> 27:07.794
- So what are those?
- The replicators.

27:09.463 --> 27:11.757
We're too late.

27:17.846 --> 27:21.266
- The Dallas is standing by in the harbour.
- Dallas?

27:21.350 --> 27:25.270
Los Angeles-class attack submarine.
It'll torpedo the Blackbird.

27:25.395 --> 27:28.482
You should probably put a hold on that.

27:28.607 --> 27:31.068
This new block is corroded.

27:31.985 --> 27:34.196
And the significance of that is...?

27:34.363 --> 27:37.533
OK, look. The way
Sam explained this to me,...

27:37.616 --> 27:40.869
..the bugs use whatever raw materials
are around to replicate.

27:40.994 --> 27:45.541
These are eating the Russian submarine,
so they're basically made of steel.

27:45.666 --> 27:47.876
That is why they are a different colour.

27:47.960 --> 27:51.213
It may also explain why
they haven't tried to get off the sub.

27:51.296 --> 27:53.507
It does?

27:53.590 --> 27:58.387
They can't. They're only as resilient
as the raw materials they're made of.

27:58.512 --> 28:02.641
These aren't like the ones on Thor's ship.
They'll rust in the water.

28:02.724 --> 28:05.269
They're less sophisticated,
and vulnerable.

28:05.352 --> 28:08.230
Then blowing up the sub
would easily destroy them.

28:08.313 --> 28:12.609
- If so, why don't we do it right now?
- Because there's one that could survive.

28:12.734 --> 28:16.071
- The one that survived Thor's ship.
- God!

28:16.196 --> 28:19.616
Right. It's the one that killed
the entire crew of that sub.

28:19.741 --> 28:23.078
We have to be sure
this won't happen again.

28:31.336 --> 28:33.797
Mother bug.

28:33.922 --> 28:36.675
It's a little dark.

28:40.554 --> 28:44.308
It's incorporated itself
into the mother... bug.

28:45.267 --> 28:49.104
- I will return with you, O'Neill.
- You sure?

28:49.188 --> 28:53.108
Look, every other bug on that sub is
gonna be pretty upset when you kill Mom.

28:53.483 --> 28:55.777
Yeah. That'd be a fair reaction.

28:55.861 --> 28:58.864
Could we not create a diversion?

28:58.947 --> 29:02.784
Replicators are attracted to
bursts of energy, are they not?

29:04.995 --> 29:09.625
Small charge on the upper level,
draw 'em away from Mom.

29:09.750 --> 29:13.170
They're in a containable situation.
Now's our shot.

29:13.253 --> 29:15.464
Sub's diesel engines just started.

29:15.589 --> 29:18.675
The replicators are tryin' to move?

29:18.759 --> 29:24.598
They're anchored for now, but you better
get out there before they decide to dive.

29:40.906 --> 29:44.076
So how long before
they reach your planet?

29:44.201 --> 29:46.495
Two hours.

29:47.287 --> 29:52.501
Your ships can go faster than light speed.
I've seen you cross the galaxy in no time.

29:52.626 --> 29:53.794
Yes.

29:53.919 --> 29:57.256
So why are the bug ships
travelling so slow?

29:57.381 --> 30:02.427
In order to generate the subspace field
required to travel at hyperspeed,...

30:02.511 --> 30:05.597
..the full power of the generators
is required.

30:05.722 --> 30:09.476
Presently they are using
that power to replicate.

30:10.269 --> 30:14.189
So if they did go to hyperspeed, it would
also mean no shields or weapons.

30:14.273 --> 30:20.612
Yes. But remember, the replicators
do not care about time as we do.

30:21.572 --> 30:24.324
Right. They're not in a hurry.

30:25.701 --> 30:28.162
How did they get control of your ships?

30:28.287 --> 30:34.793
They are capable of modifying our own
technology beyond our understanding.

30:34.877 --> 30:37.254
I thought they learned
everything from you.

30:37.337 --> 30:42.551
It is possible they have gained knowledge
from sources other than the Asgard.

30:42.676 --> 30:46.763
The bottom line is we can't touch them,
but they could easily take this ship...

30:46.847 --> 30:50.100
- ..or blow it up if they wanted.
- Yes.

30:50.225 --> 30:53.812
- So why don't they?
- We have shown no signs of aggression.

30:53.896 --> 30:58.609
And this ship's technology is less
advanced than the ships they occupy.

31:02.696 --> 31:05.240
I'm not really helping, am l?

31:13.081 --> 31:16.585
- Charge is set.
- They're submerging.

31:16.668 --> 31:18.795
- Yes, sir.
- Jack, the sub is diving.

31:28.096 --> 31:31.058
Yeah. We got that.
Headin' to the battery deck.

31:35.062 --> 31:36.438
We're losing their signal.

31:36.522 --> 31:39.608
The sub can't dive below periscope depth
on diesel engines.

31:39.733 --> 31:41.860
Radio-transmission boosters launched.

31:41.985 --> 31:45.322
- How do they get out underwater?
- Escape hatch...

31:45.447 --> 31:47.491
Yes, sir.

31:53.997 --> 31:56.458
(Thor) You are tired.

31:57.584 --> 31:59.211
Yeah.

31:59.336 --> 32:03.257
It is another advantage
the replicators have over us.

32:03.340 --> 32:05.801
They do not require rest.

32:08.345 --> 32:10.472
But they do have to eat.

32:10.556 --> 32:13.016
Yes. In order to replicate.

32:13.600 --> 32:16.603
And they are what they eat, right?

32:16.687 --> 32:19.147
What's the strongest material
you know of?

32:19.231 --> 32:24.570
We have just developed a new alloy
of naqahdah, trinium and carbon.

32:24.653 --> 32:28.574
It was used to create
the hull of the O'Neill.

32:28.699 --> 32:32.202
- Can that ship reach hyperspeed yet?
- Yes.

32:33.036 --> 32:37.124
Can it be flown using autopilot
or some sort of remote control?

32:37.207 --> 32:40.878
- Why?
- To get the replicators to chase after it.

32:40.961 --> 32:43.088
It is possible. However...

32:43.714 --> 32:48.093
That ship is everything they want.
It'll look like an all-you-can-eat buffet.

32:48.218 --> 32:53.182
But it is not completed. They will
capture it and consume its technology.

32:53.307 --> 32:56.226
Not if you rig it to self-destruct.

32:56.935 --> 32:59.396
I do not understand.

32:59.521 --> 33:04.151
You said that the bugs can't use
shields or weapons in hyperspeed.

33:04.234 --> 33:08.155
If the O'Neill enters hyperspeed,
the bugs will have to in order to follow.

33:08.280 --> 33:11.450
When they do, you blow the O'Neill
and take the bugs with it.

33:11.533 --> 33:14.077
Major Carter, you are suggesting...

33:14.203 --> 33:18.749
..that we destroy the most advanced
Asgard attack vessel ever created...

33:18.874 --> 33:21.418
- ..before it is even finished.
- I know.

33:21.543 --> 33:26.840
The O'Neill is our last hope
of successfully attacking infested ships.

33:26.924 --> 33:31.887
It won't attack anything if the bugs
get to your planet before it's finished.

33:32.012 --> 33:36.558
You said you didn't think the answer
had to do with your technology any more.

33:36.642 --> 33:41.188
- If they do not follow the O'Neill...
- We have to believe that they will.

33:41.271 --> 33:46.318
If the replicators are able to infest
the O'Neill and disable the self-destruct...

33:46.443 --> 33:48.737
They consume the ship
and its technology,...

33:48.862 --> 33:51.740
..and we will have created
the most advanced bugs yet.

33:51.824 --> 33:56.036
- I know. It's a risk.
- A risk we cannot take.

34:29.194 --> 34:31.237
(explosion)

34:36.534 --> 34:37.870
(scuttling)

34:58.348 --> 35:02.102
The reason I am here is because
you want me to suggest a strategy...

35:02.186 --> 35:04.313
..that you would never think of.

35:04.438 --> 35:07.524
You keep trying to defeat them
with better technology...

35:07.608 --> 35:10.319
..and they absorb it
and become more advanced.

35:10.402 --> 35:13.071
You have to use that against them.

35:13.155 --> 35:17.451
We know that they'll go after the O'Neill
because it's your most advanced ship.

35:17.576 --> 35:20.037
They'll think you want
to keep it from them.

35:20.120 --> 35:23.707
They won't expect you to blow it up.
It's a tactic they've never seen.

35:23.790 --> 35:27.211
- It's a tactic we would never consider.
- Exactly!

35:27.336 --> 35:31.465
Otherwise we just stand here
and watch them invade your world.

35:31.548 --> 35:36.345
I'm sorry. Maybe it's a really stupid idea,
but isn't that why I'm here?

35:37.888 --> 35:40.349
Then we should try it.

36:11.296 --> 36:13.507
Son of a bitch!

36:21.723 --> 36:25.811
- I believe you got it, O'Neill.
- Yeah, I think I got it.

36:32.150 --> 36:34.194
What the hell...?

36:37.990 --> 36:40.033
O'Neill!

36:49.001 --> 36:51.461
Ah, crap!

36:52.504 --> 36:56.967
Colonel O'Neill, is there any way
you can make it to the escape hatch?

37:10.898 --> 37:14.234
- The anchor line just snapped.
- Is there anything we can do?

37:14.359 --> 37:17.946
Best thing is to chase them into
shallow water and hope they surface.

37:18.071 --> 37:20.824
No, there's not enough time for that.

37:22.576 --> 37:25.287
Teal'c! Let's try this!

37:37.633 --> 37:39.676
Ok, forget that.

38:00.197 --> 38:06.036
- You better go ahead and blow this thing.
- That's not a positive attitude, Jack.

38:06.578 --> 38:10.332
Listen to me!
We are not gettin' outta here!

38:10.415 --> 38:12.543
Mission accomplished. Blow it!

38:13.085 --> 38:15.295
- Jack!
- Daniel, please!

38:15.420 --> 38:19.800
Nuke my ass before I get eaten alive
by these damn bugs!

38:22.010 --> 38:24.555
Davis! Give the order!

38:24.638 --> 38:26.765
(gunfiire)

38:42.865 --> 38:45.576
The O'Neill has been launched.

38:51.999 --> 38:54.459
They're chasing it.

38:56.712 --> 39:00.549
The O'Neill will now enter hyperspeed.

39:15.731 --> 39:18.025
It worked.

39:26.200 --> 39:28.243
Yes!

39:29.077 --> 39:30.496
Ooh!

39:30.579 --> 39:33.665
I'm sorry! I didn't hurt you, did l?

39:33.790 --> 39:36.001
I am fine.

39:36.084 --> 39:40.714
- We did it.
- It was your stupid idea, Major Carter.

40:00.609 --> 40:03.153
OK... OK...

40:03.237 --> 40:05.697
Fire on target.

40:07.574 --> 40:10.118
Dallas is firing torpedoes.

40:13.664 --> 40:19.169
Eight seconds to impact.
Blackbird attempting evasive manoeuvre.

40:23.632 --> 40:27.386
Torpedoes still on target. Two seconds.

40:35.727 --> 40:37.771
Direct hit.

40:48.073 --> 40:50.117
They're OK.

40:51.201 --> 40:53.412
- What?
- The...

40:53.912 --> 40:55.956
The... The...

40:56.832 --> 40:59.126
The... They're OK!

41:15.058 --> 41:18.395
- Now, that's timing!
- We came as soon as we could, sir.

41:20.814 --> 41:23.442
Teal'c, you all right?

41:23.525 --> 41:25.819
I am, O'Neill.

41:26.737 --> 41:32.659
- I take it things weren't going well.
- We had things handled pretty good.

41:32.868 --> 41:36.914
- The bugs are taken care of down there?
- Pretty much. You?

41:37.956 --> 41:40.250
We kicked their asses.

41:41.543 --> 41:43.837
They had asses?

41:43.921 --> 41:47.508
The Asgard had this big new ship.
The O'Neill.

41:49.718 --> 41:51.595
Oh, yeah?

41:51.720 --> 41:54.431
But... we had to blow it up.

41:56.141 --> 41:59.478
- Oh.
- The Asgard are most grateful.

41:59.603 --> 42:04.233
One day we shall repay you
by helping to fight the Goa'uld.

42:05.275 --> 42:06.360
One day?

42:06.443 --> 42:09.696
Saving one Asgard planet
is a small victory.

42:10.656 --> 42:15.202
The conflict with the replicators
stretches across my galaxy.

42:15.285 --> 42:18.247
Major Carter's strategy
worked this time,...

42:18.330 --> 42:21.208
..but the replicators are very intelligent.

42:21.291 --> 42:24.294
- It may not work again.
- I get it.

42:26.296 --> 42:30.425
However, now there is hope
where once there was none.

42:31.260 --> 42:35.639
Well, if you ever need any more dumb
ideas, you know where to find me.

42:36.056 --> 42:38.433
- Until we meet again.
- Yeah.

42:38.559 --> 42:41.353
Hey, listen! Stop by any time.

42:41.436 --> 42:44.773
In fact... I'll take you fishin'.
I'd love to do that.

42:44.857 --> 42:49.403
There's this lake in northern Minnesota
where the bass grow that big. Well...
