00:01.135 --> 00:04.536
Nothing says school spirit like a ring
that looks like it was jacked from P. Diddy.

00:04.705 --> 00:07.037
- I think it looks great.
- I think we'll be lucky...

00:07.208 --> 00:09.972
...if the glue holds through graduation.

00:10.211 --> 00:12.645
I wonder if the ruby's even real.

00:15.049 --> 00:17.017
You sure you're gonna do this?

00:17.184 --> 00:18.879
I'm here, aren't I?

00:21.589 --> 00:24.615
- What?
- I believe your dad's exact words were:

00:24.792 --> 00:28.785
"Three hundred and fifty dollars is a lot to
spend on something you really don't need."

00:28.963 --> 00:32.091
I earned that money. Besides,
Dad said it was my decision to make.

00:32.266 --> 00:35.292
Which means that you're really not
supposed to buy it.

00:37.338 --> 00:42.241
I know the first day at a new school can be
rough, so if you have questions, just ask.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.571
So, what do you Crows do for fun?

00:44.745 --> 00:47.373
Between the tractor-pulls
and the hoedowns.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.846
- There's the Talon.
- Which is...?

00:50.017 --> 00:52.645
A coffeehouse,
and a really cool place to hang out.

00:52.820 --> 00:57.780
But I'm kind of biased,
because I sort of own it.

00:57.992 --> 01:00.222
Gee, I'll have to check it out.

01:02.163 --> 01:05.462
Whoa. Who is the major hottie
in primary colors?

01:06.400 --> 01:08.595
That's Clark Kent.

01:09.603 --> 01:12.629
No offense, Lana, but maybe
I could get him to show me around.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:35.830 --> 01:37.559
You feeling all right?

01:39.133 --> 01:40.498
Yeah, I feel great.

01:40.668 --> 01:42.329
Excuse me.

01:42.503 --> 01:44.471
It's Jessie, isn't it?

01:44.638 --> 01:49.098
Perhaps Ms. Lang didn't tell you, but
there's a dress code here at Smallville High.

01:49.276 --> 01:50.573
Lame and lamer?

01:53.280 --> 01:55.475
You think that's funny, Mr. Kent?

01:56.016 --> 01:57.449
By the way, I'm not changing.

01:57.618 --> 02:00.712
Well, perhaps you'd like
to discuss your attitude in my office.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.391
Excuse me, Mr. Gibbons?

02:08.963 --> 02:13.195
I think she looks really hot,
and I think that your dress code sucks.

02:13.367 --> 02:14.425
Excuse me?

02:14.602 --> 02:18.595
I mean, come on.
It's her first day, cut her some slack.

02:18.772 --> 02:21.935
Besides, I don't think you
should be the one giving fashion tips.

02:25.646 --> 02:29.980
Tomorrow, young lady,
proper attire or you're going straight home.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.247
I guess we can finish our tour.

02:40.895 --> 02:43.125
Where did that come from?

02:43.931 --> 02:45.694
I don't know...

02:48.335 --> 02:50.269
...but I think I liked it.

02:58.479 --> 03:01.175
I'm telling you, man,
I don't know where she is.

03:01.482 --> 03:03.006
Look, Kyle...

03:11.425 --> 03:13.825
What kind of U.S. Marshal are you,
anyways?

03:14.295 --> 03:16.525
The kind that gets results.

03:19.266 --> 03:21.734
- Okay.
- Okay? Okay, what?

03:21.902 --> 03:23.665
I've heard from her once or twice.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.964
She called me collect
from someplace in Kansas.

03:26.273 --> 03:28.434
Where in Kansas? It's a big state.

03:28.609 --> 03:31.669
All over. They were from pay phones.

03:31.845 --> 03:35.008
Check my phone bill. That's all I know.

03:35.182 --> 03:37.150
You have to believe me.

03:38.285 --> 03:39.946
Relax.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.517
I believe you.

03:44.191 --> 03:46.523
So you'll let me go now?

03:46.694 --> 03:49.390
Oh, I would, but Jessie might call.

03:49.563 --> 03:52.555
And you might decide to warn her.

05:01.469 --> 05:03.198
So this is what I was talking about.

05:03.371 --> 05:05.839
It's right over the county line,
and they don't check IDs.

05:06.007 --> 05:07.167
Dude, this is like a bar.

05:07.341 --> 05:10.936
I know. You're the one who says if you
wanna have fun, you gotta take risks.

05:11.145 --> 05:12.305
We can go this weekend.

05:12.480 --> 05:15.074
The day Clark Kent decides to break rules,
I'll be there.

05:15.249 --> 05:16.841
- All right.
- Clark, right?

05:17.018 --> 05:20.954
Jessie Brooks. That place rocks.
I checked it out on my way into town.

05:21.122 --> 05:24.250
- Are you planning a road trip?
- Lf we do, I'll let you know.

05:32.767 --> 05:35.361
You'll need to know
how to get in touch with me.

05:42.143 --> 05:45.044
In case you require a translation,
that was her hitting on you.

05:45.212 --> 05:46.201
She is kind of hot.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.240
Aren't you married to Lana
in your imagination?

05:50.317 --> 05:53.844
Clark! You and Jessie
seem to be making fast friends.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.785
Just trying to make
the new girl feel welcome.

05:58.426 --> 06:01.589
Don't worry, Lana,
I haven't taken my eye off you all day.

06:03.964 --> 06:07.263
So we still on for that cram session
tonight at the Talon?

06:07.635 --> 06:10.103
If you're still gonna be there, absolutely.

06:10.638 --> 06:11.866
I'll be there.

06:20.948 --> 06:24.076
So soon as you get this shined
to your liking, I get the first ride.

06:24.251 --> 06:27.186
Yep, and all the others
can just take a number.

06:27.655 --> 06:30.146
Hey, where's Clark? He's really late.

06:31.659 --> 06:33.490
Looking for me?

06:34.161 --> 06:37.927
Yeah. Weren't you supposed to be here
with me, working on the garage door?

06:38.099 --> 06:40.158
Dad, that'll take, like, two seconds.

06:43.637 --> 06:46.470
And I thought we agreed
you weren't gonna buy that ring.

06:47.575 --> 06:50.100
I thought we decided
it was my decision to make.

06:52.179 --> 06:55.410
That's because I assumed
that you would make the right one.

06:56.217 --> 06:57.980
Clark, that ring costs a lot of money.

06:58.185 --> 07:00.745
And I'm tired of worrying
about every nickel and dime.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.253
Clark, why don't you go wash up for dinner.

07:03.424 --> 07:06.518
I'm not hungry.
Besides, I have chores to do.

07:08.829 --> 07:10.854
What was that all about?

07:11.065 --> 07:15.195
I think our not-so-normal son might be going
through some classic teenage rebellion.

07:15.369 --> 07:18.668
Well, I think I liked dealing
with heat vision a lot better than that.

07:18.906 --> 07:22.501
- Martha, that was a bad decision he made.
- But it was his to make.

07:23.210 --> 07:26.407
I seem to recall a certain young man
who defied his father...

07:26.580 --> 07:29.674
...and spent $500 on an old motorcycle.

07:31.552 --> 07:34.715
Challenging him is only gonna
make it worse.

07:48.502 --> 07:51.869
When I got up this morning,
I was pretty sure this was my office.

07:52.039 --> 07:56.032
Lex! I thought you wouldn't mind
if I had a few changes made...

07:56.210 --> 07:58.201
...since I'm gonna be here a while.
Go on.

07:58.379 --> 08:00.870
What I mind is not being consulted.

08:06.687 --> 08:10.885
I didn't realize I'd need
my son's permission to try to make my...

08:11.058 --> 08:13.492
...situation here a trifle more bearable.

08:13.827 --> 08:18.491
I've lost my sight.
Allow me at least a modicum of dignity.

08:19.934 --> 08:22.368
Give him whatever he wants.

08:35.783 --> 08:39.014
- Barkeep, I'm looking for a girl.
- Aren't we all?

08:39.852 --> 08:42.616
The girl in this photo
used that phone over there.

08:43.524 --> 08:44.889
Any crime in that?

08:45.059 --> 08:47.152
No, but she is a teenager...

08:47.328 --> 08:51.287
...and we both know the
legal drinking age in Kansas is 21.

08:53.467 --> 08:56.197
If she comes back in, you call me.

08:56.370 --> 08:58.531
The number's on the back.

09:09.283 --> 09:12.116
I think we should start in the middle...

09:15.289 --> 09:19.350
Hey, Clark, glad you made it. We're just
doing American history, the Red Scare.

09:19.526 --> 09:22.586
Hey, can we do that tomorrow?

09:22.763 --> 09:24.822
- Why, is something wrong?
- No, it...

09:24.999 --> 09:28.332
It's really nice out tonight.
Let's go for a drive, go dancing.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.566
Are you asking me on a date?

09:32.840 --> 09:35.673
I'm asking you to have some fun with me.

09:36.677 --> 09:41.137
This is a little unexpected,
to say the least.

09:41.649 --> 09:43.173
But we really have to study.

09:43.350 --> 09:46.717
Did you know when you get all serious,
your nose crinkles up?

09:47.655 --> 09:49.486
It's really sexy.

09:52.026 --> 09:54.153
Pete and Chloe are waiting for us.

10:05.973 --> 10:09.340
- Well, let me use your sheet.
- Yeah. Maybe we should check...

10:10.744 --> 10:13.008
What did you get for number five?

10:14.515 --> 10:16.312
Hey, man.

10:16.483 --> 10:18.110
Where are your books?

10:18.319 --> 10:20.253
You guys want to go to a bar?

10:21.522 --> 10:25.390
You can commit academic hara-kiri,
but the rest of us need to cram for this test.

10:25.559 --> 10:28.153
You guys, high school's supposed to be fun.

10:28.329 --> 10:30.263
This is not fun.

10:30.464 --> 10:33.865
- Come on, my treat.
- When did you and the money truck hook up?

10:34.034 --> 10:37.162
Since I decided there's no percentage
in playing poverty.

10:37.404 --> 10:39.804
I'm gonna get a refill.
I'm gonna get you some decaf.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.702
Here, I'll give you a hand.

10:46.046 --> 10:48.571
Yeah, I have never...

10:50.584 --> 10:53.246
Did you know that Chloe
had a birthmark on her cheek?

10:53.454 --> 10:56.082
- No, she doesn't.
- Not that cheek.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.356
Are you doing what I think you're doing?

11:04.932 --> 11:08.629
- Clark, that's Chloe you're scoping, man.
- Not just Chloe.

11:13.507 --> 11:17.671
- Come on, let's go have some fun.
- Clark, this test is half our grade.

11:17.911 --> 11:21.677
If you want to party this weekend, I'm
with you, but right now, I need to do this.

11:21.849 --> 11:26.548
All right. Well, when you're through with
Boring 101, give me a call.

11:35.996 --> 11:37.691
You're kidding.

11:38.165 --> 11:39.860
Thank you.

11:40.567 --> 11:42.228
What's wrong?

11:42.403 --> 11:44.837
That was the credit card company.
They were...

11:45.005 --> 11:49.203
...calling to verify some charges that
were made on our card? Last night?

11:57.117 --> 11:59.813
When did we get a satellite dish?

12:10.431 --> 12:12.558
This is silk!

12:40.794 --> 12:44.355
- Clark!
- Clark! Where did you get all this?

12:44.531 --> 12:47.864
Discount Eddie's in Metropolis.
Open all night!

12:49.136 --> 12:50.831
You mean to tell...

12:51.004 --> 12:55.338
You mean you took
our credit cards and you bought all this...?

12:55.509 --> 12:57.374
- You bought all this junk?
- Yeah.

12:57.544 --> 13:00.445
I figured it was time I had
the cool stuff everyone else has.

13:00.614 --> 13:02.377
Clark Kent, you stole from us.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.540
No. I used your credit cards.

13:07.020 --> 13:10.080
What's the big deal?
We don't have to pay for it right away.

13:10.858 --> 13:12.485
Well, I'll tell you the big deal...

13:12.659 --> 13:16.561
...the big deal is, you're gonna take all this
garbage back right now. Come on!

13:16.730 --> 13:18.129
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah, right.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.993
After you've taken this garbage back...

13:20.167 --> 13:23.864
...we're gonna have a conversation
about this new attitude you've developed.

13:24.037 --> 13:27.063
Well, Dad, you can talk all you want.
I'm out of here.

13:32.479 --> 13:35.312
Clark! Clark, come back here!

14:00.340 --> 14:02.433
You're not going to school
dressed like that.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.236
Okay. Then I just won't go.

14:04.411 --> 14:06.379
Jessie, please, you're a smart girl.

14:06.547 --> 14:09.675
You know we can't afford
to draw attention to ourselves.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.756
Need a ride?

14:19.426 --> 14:20.791
Clark?

14:26.099 --> 14:27.828
Jessie.

14:28.702 --> 14:32.069
- My hero.
- Jessie, I need you to...

14:56.263 --> 15:01.667
Okay, what planet is that guy from
and what did he do with Clark?

15:07.007 --> 15:09.373
Well, Clark...

15:09.543 --> 15:11.443
...thanks for the ride.

15:11.612 --> 15:13.102
Anytime.

15:16.083 --> 15:19.985
So much for the shy and retiring Clark Kent.

15:20.654 --> 15:22.713
I was just giving her a ride to school.

15:22.889 --> 15:25.858
Say the word and
I'll save you the return trip.

15:31.098 --> 15:33.089
Catch up with you later.

15:33.800 --> 15:37.031
Clark Kent, chick magnet.
What's wrong with this picture?

15:37.204 --> 15:39.035
People change, Pete.

15:39.873 --> 15:43.809
- Clark, I'd like a word with you, please.
- Not right now, Dad.

15:46.813 --> 15:50.510
- Get in the truck, son.
- Give me one good reason why I should.

15:50.684 --> 15:54.450
Because I am your father,
and I just told you to get in the truck.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.418
You're not my father.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.482
You never were.

16:09.603 --> 16:11.537
You all right, sir?

16:23.116 --> 16:24.743
Here you go.

16:26.186 --> 16:30.247
- I can't believe Clark would do that.
- It's like he's a whole different person.

16:30.424 --> 16:33.791
- How are we gonna get him home?
- I don't know.

16:34.094 --> 16:37.962
Fact is, if he doesn't want to come home,
there isn't much either one of us can do.

16:38.131 --> 16:41.191
Here, I'll take it. I'll get that.

16:42.102 --> 16:44.935
Takes your whole teenage-rebellion
theory to a new level.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.903
This is more than teenage rebellion.

16:49.309 --> 16:51.937
A change this drastic
doesn't happen overnight.

16:52.212 --> 16:54.237
Martha, it's Clark.

16:54.414 --> 16:56.575
All of his other abilities
cropped up overnight.

16:56.750 --> 16:58.843
Do you think this is part
of his development?

16:59.019 --> 17:01.988
I don't know.
But from what he said...

17:02.723 --> 17:05.556
...I guess those feelings have been
boiling up for a while.

17:05.726 --> 17:08.092
No, Jonathan, Clark loves you.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.661
But there's something
seriously wrong with him.

17:11.598 --> 17:15.159
I don't think another father-and-son talk
is gonna help this time.

17:16.502 --> 17:18.436
Maybe Pete can help.

17:19.071 --> 17:20.300
They're always together.

17:20.473 --> 17:23.772
We should find out if he has
any idea what's causing Clark's behavior.

17:23.944 --> 17:25.969
Well, we've gotta do something.

17:35.455 --> 17:37.753
Lana, we need to talk.

17:38.024 --> 17:40.754
Clark, please, I really need
to get these orders done.

17:40.927 --> 17:42.258
Your coffee can wait.

17:42.763 --> 17:46.028
I got the impression that you were
jealous when you saw me with Jessie.

17:47.501 --> 17:51.198
Don't be ridiculous.
You can spend time with anyone you want.

17:51.738 --> 17:54.468
Don't get me wrong.
I was happy you were jealous.

17:56.610 --> 17:58.703
Clark, what is going on with you?

17:58.879 --> 18:01.575
I've decided to tell you the truth, Lana.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.116
About...?

18:04.284 --> 18:07.253
- About everything?
- Try me.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.217
What do you want to know?

18:10.257 --> 18:13.385
For starters, how about what
happened the day the twisters hit?

18:14.828 --> 18:16.625
We'll get there.

18:16.930 --> 18:21.128
But right now we should concentrate
on more important things, like...

18:22.435 --> 18:25.404
I've had feelings for you for a long time...

18:25.906 --> 18:29.342
...and I know that
you've had feelings for me too.

18:30.644 --> 18:33.340
So I think we should stop pretending.

18:34.848 --> 18:38.443
So, what?
Is this supposed to be some...

18:38.618 --> 18:42.486
...all-new Clark Kent?
- Well, that depends.

18:44.858 --> 18:46.655
Do you like him?

19:04.845 --> 19:07.370
Clark, l...

19:07.547 --> 19:09.640
What about Jessie?

19:09.883 --> 19:11.942
Jessie who?

19:13.753 --> 19:16.187
You're the one I want to be with.

19:19.059 --> 19:20.549
I'll pick you up at 8.

19:34.908 --> 19:37.741
Pete, you are not gonna believe
what I found out.

19:37.911 --> 19:40.846
Our "el cheapo" class rings are,
in fact, fake.

19:41.014 --> 19:43.539
Chloe, there's something wrong with Clark.

19:45.452 --> 19:46.919
More than usual?

19:47.087 --> 19:49.851
Last night at the Talon,
the motorcycle...

19:51.091 --> 19:53.116
...other stuff.
- What kind of other stuff?

19:53.293 --> 19:55.693
The kind that has
Mr. And Mrs. Kent calling my house.

19:55.862 --> 19:58.456
They're worried.
It's, like, they think he's on drugs.

19:58.798 --> 20:02.131
Clark would have to be on drugs
to be on drugs.

20:02.569 --> 20:03.934
Just be careful with that.

20:04.104 --> 20:06.334
- What is it, anyway?
- My expose.

20:06.506 --> 20:11.239
See this lovely $350 piece of
school spirit? It's a rip-off.

20:11.411 --> 20:15.142
The jewelry company was substituting
worthless meteor rocks for rubies...

20:15.315 --> 20:17.408
...to save money.
- Chloe...

20:17.584 --> 20:19.415
...rings, red. Meteor rocks, green.

20:19.586 --> 20:22.680
Not the load they found near
Hobbs Pond. Note the red vein.

20:23.590 --> 20:26.821
You can read all about it
on page one of today's Torch.

20:30.697 --> 20:32.164
Pete.

20:35.535 --> 20:38.561
Chloe's gonna force a recall
because the rings are made from this.

20:38.738 --> 20:42.139
- Think that's what's causing his behavior?
- Well, that's when it started.

20:42.309 --> 20:43.901
Right after he slipped on the ring.

20:44.077 --> 20:46.568
If the green meteor rocks
affect Clark physically...

20:46.746 --> 20:48.737
...maybe the red affects him emotionally.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.678
That explains his personality changes.

20:50.850 --> 20:53.478
The longer he's exposed to the green,
the worse he gets.

20:53.653 --> 20:55.746
If the same is true with the red,
God help us.

20:55.922 --> 20:59.221
- We're gonna find him, get that ring back.
- How are we gonna do that?

20:59.392 --> 21:02.452
Like you said, if he doesn't
wanna do something, we can't force it.

21:02.629 --> 21:05.860
Sweetheart, I don't know,
but we have to figure out a way.

21:14.841 --> 21:19.210
I came to shoot some pool, but it looks like
this establishment's been closed.

21:19.379 --> 21:23.873
My father's presence
has required certain sacrifices.

21:24.150 --> 21:26.209
- Why don't you throw him out?
- Clark...

21:26.386 --> 21:29.651
...it's not like the thought
hasn't occurred to me, but...

21:33.159 --> 21:35.423
...his blindness changes the situation.

21:35.595 --> 21:39.497
Just because your father has a problem
doesn't mean he needs to ruin your life.

21:40.500 --> 21:44.197
I wasn't aware a $2000 coat
came with a backbone.

21:44.371 --> 21:46.236
What's going on?

21:46.473 --> 21:49.874
I'd like to borrow the Ferrari.
Got a hot date tonight, and I wanna...

21:50.043 --> 21:52.011
...rock her world.

21:53.079 --> 21:54.774
"Rock her world"?

21:56.416 --> 21:58.008
So, Lana at last.

21:58.184 --> 22:00.778
Like you said, a man needs
to know when to make his move.

22:00.954 --> 22:03.514
I'm glad you're finally
acting on your feelings, but...

22:03.690 --> 22:06.659
...Lana's never struck me as a girl
to be impressed by a Ferrari.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.726
Fast cars...

22:08.895 --> 22:11.693
...fancy home and a ton of money
never hurt you, did it?

22:12.499 --> 22:14.626
Come on, I just
want to make tonight special.

22:14.801 --> 22:19.431
I don't know. It's a very expensive
piece of machinery, difficult to handle.

22:19.606 --> 22:21.540
It's not like I'm going to...

22:21.708 --> 22:23.972
...drive it off a bridge.

22:25.645 --> 22:28.273
All you have to ask yourself is...

22:28.715 --> 22:31.582
...who's more responsible than Clark Kent?

22:57.811 --> 22:59.403
This place is great!

22:59.579 --> 23:03.071
I guess. Not exactly what I was expecting.

23:06.086 --> 23:08.111
What are you looking at?

23:08.288 --> 23:10.085
Clark, I'm fine.

23:10.256 --> 23:11.780
I'm fine.

23:15.662 --> 23:17.254
- Want a beer?
- What?

23:17.430 --> 23:20.558
- Do you want a beer?
- No! And since when do you drink?

23:20.733 --> 23:22.496
If you don't wanna drink, let's dance.

23:22.669 --> 23:25.900
Clark, this place isn't us.
Let's go somewhere else and talk.

23:26.072 --> 23:28.802
I'll take that dance, Clark.

23:32.545 --> 23:34.513
- Whoa!
- I took your advice, Lana...

23:34.681 --> 23:36.546
...and checked out the Talon.
- Yeah?

23:36.716 --> 23:39.116
Yeah, that's why I decided to come here.

23:42.589 --> 23:45.649
- Clark, come on. Let's go.
- One dance.

23:50.530 --> 23:52.657
Lana, I'll be right back.

24:06.079 --> 24:10.743
- So do you like living in Smallville?
- It's the only place I ever lived.

24:12.352 --> 24:16.584
Well, there's a big, bad world out there.
The right person ought to show you.

24:16.756 --> 24:18.690
Anyone in mind?

24:23.062 --> 24:24.962
I'm leaving.

24:25.331 --> 24:26.992
Lana, we just got here.

24:27.767 --> 24:30.895
Why don't you go get us some drinks.
We'll all have a good time.

24:31.070 --> 24:34.597
You're unbelievable!
What happened to telling the truth?

24:34.774 --> 24:37.038
What happened to
"Spend time with whoever you want"?

24:37.210 --> 24:40.577
- Is that the way you want it?
- Sure. There's enough of me to go around.

24:41.681 --> 24:44.809
- Lana...
- Is there a problem here?

24:47.887 --> 24:49.582
Not anymore.

24:50.156 --> 24:52.215
I'd let the lady go if I were you.

25:04.204 --> 25:07.731
- You're going down, smart guy.
- I don't think so.

25:18.251 --> 25:19.775
Oh, God!

25:19.953 --> 25:21.716
- Oh, God!
- Help him!

25:24.991 --> 25:27.221
Anybody else?

25:33.733 --> 25:35.701
I can't be here when the cops get here.

25:35.868 --> 25:41.363
Yeah, let's go pack our bags, see that
big, bad world you were talking about.

25:43.042 --> 25:44.703
Let it go, man! Let it go!

25:48.214 --> 25:50.512
Where were you all night?
We looked everywhere.

25:50.683 --> 25:52.583
Last night was the best night of my life.

25:52.752 --> 25:55.152
- We want to help you.
- Help me?

25:55.321 --> 25:57.846
Help me what? Stay here on the farm?

25:58.024 --> 26:01.187
Doing chores, wasting my life
for a $20-a-week allowance?

26:01.694 --> 26:05.562
Clark, I wish you could hear yourself for
just a minute. There's something very...

26:05.732 --> 26:08.292
...very wrong with you. It's that ring.

26:09.736 --> 26:12.603
You're still upset about me
buying this stupid thing.

26:12.772 --> 26:14.637
How pathetic.

26:14.807 --> 26:16.035
Clark.

26:16.209 --> 26:18.404
You really don't want to touch me.

26:20.079 --> 26:22.047
Why don't you just hand it to me, then.

26:22.682 --> 26:28.018
Clark, please, it isn't the ring itself. Chloe
found out it's made out of red meteor rock.

26:28.321 --> 26:30.312
You know how the green rock
makes you sick?

26:30.490 --> 26:32.890
Well, we think the red rock
is affecting your mind.

26:33.059 --> 26:35.254
It's changed your personality, Clark.

26:35.428 --> 26:39.262
So everything I've been doing and saying
is because of this?

26:39.432 --> 26:42.731
That's right. That's why you gotta
take that thing off right away.

26:42.902 --> 26:45.598
Take it off?
I just wish I would have found it sooner.

26:45.772 --> 26:48.206
If you guys wanna
waste your life in this mudhole...

26:48.374 --> 26:51.241
...that's your problem.
I'm through being poor.

26:51.744 --> 26:54.406
We might not have
all the things that other people have.

26:54.580 --> 26:58.573
- I didn't think our family was about that.
- With my abilities, I can make millions.

26:58.751 --> 27:01.242
Sports, TV, it's all waiting for me.

27:01.421 --> 27:03.719
You're the ones who
force me to hide who I am.

27:03.890 --> 27:06.916
No. We are the ones
who have been trying to protect you.

27:07.093 --> 27:08.993
We don't want anybody taking you away.

27:09.162 --> 27:11.722
Protecting me? Using me.

27:12.165 --> 27:14.929
I'm just another piece of equipment
to keep your farm going.

27:15.101 --> 27:16.534
That's all gonna change.

27:28.481 --> 27:31.416
Lex, if it's all right, I'm gonna
keep the Ferrari a bit longer.

27:31.584 --> 27:36.385
- I'll send it back when I get myself set up.
- Whoa, slow down. Clark, what's going on?

27:42.895 --> 27:44.760
I left home.

27:45.064 --> 27:47.430
What happened?
You have a fight with your folks?

27:47.600 --> 27:49.693
My parents don't understand me.

27:50.870 --> 27:53.634
The truth is, there's nothing left
for me in Smallville.

27:54.674 --> 27:55.936
What about Lana?

27:57.110 --> 28:00.807
She's old news.
I got a new girl, Jessie.

28:00.980 --> 28:02.504
Kind of sudden, isn't it?

28:02.682 --> 28:05.082
You're the one always telling me
to find my destiny.

28:05.251 --> 28:08.516
Well, one thing's for certain,
it's not here in Kansas.

28:09.255 --> 28:11.815
So you've just packed
your stuff and you're off.

28:13.993 --> 28:16.928
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

28:18.698 --> 28:20.222
Really?

28:20.666 --> 28:22.258
Why don't you fill me in.

28:25.671 --> 28:29.869
Let's just say that when I'm through
showing the world what I can do...

28:30.042 --> 28:34.035
...I'll have everything I've ever wanted.
I may be even richer than you.

28:34.981 --> 28:37.108
Maybe you're right
to get away from your folks.

28:37.283 --> 28:39.274
Maybe I should do the same.

28:39.452 --> 28:42.649
If my father wants the mansion so much...

28:42.889 --> 28:44.550
...he can have it.

28:44.724 --> 28:47.818
- I never wanted to live in Smallville.
- You can come with me.

28:47.994 --> 28:50.360
Nobody's using
the penthouse in Metropolis.

28:51.030 --> 28:53.430
Clark Kent and Lex Luthor.

28:53.599 --> 28:54.827
I like the sound of that.

28:55.001 --> 28:57.834
Let me just tie up
some loose ends at the office.

28:58.004 --> 29:00.564
Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.

29:10.817 --> 29:13.877
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:14.120 --> 29:18.557
So I heard from a source that you had
a big date with Clark last night.

29:18.991 --> 29:23.087
Wouldn't call it a date when the guy
you went with leaves with someone else.

29:23.329 --> 29:27.459
Wow. You just went
from the gossip column to page one.

29:28.601 --> 29:31.764
Sorry, sometimes my
"glib-o-meter" goes into overdrive.

29:31.938 --> 29:35.601
No. I guess...
You know, he's so secretive.

29:35.775 --> 29:38.073
I guess I was thrown for a loop...

29:38.244 --> 29:42.112
...by a Clark who could say all the things
that the old Clark couldn't.

29:42.915 --> 29:45.577
Well, welcome to the conundrum
that is Clark Kent.

29:45.751 --> 29:49.414
Part knight in shining armor,
part "Where did that come from?"

29:49.589 --> 29:51.079
Miss?

29:51.257 --> 29:54.055
- Can I get a refill here?
- Yeah. Yeah, just a second.

29:54.227 --> 29:55.660
Thanks.

29:58.231 --> 30:00.199
Here you go.

30:01.534 --> 30:03.161
Louise.

30:03.536 --> 30:07.028
Did you get an owner and an address
on the license plate I asked you to run?

30:10.676 --> 30:12.735
Of course I know who he is.

30:12.912 --> 30:15.244
Thanks. You're an angel.

30:17.750 --> 30:19.877
Are you sure this is the right thing to do?

30:20.052 --> 30:24.955
Pete, Clark would not listen to reason.
We don't have much of a choice here.

30:26.025 --> 30:28.084
There's only one way
to stop the unstoppable.

30:28.261 --> 30:29.660
- Yeah...
- Excuse me.

30:30.363 --> 30:31.591
Mr. Kent.

30:31.764 --> 30:34.631
Pete, why don't you...
Why don't you get going.

30:37.670 --> 30:39.570
Lex, this is really not a very good time.

30:39.739 --> 30:42.264
I understand you and Clark
have been having problems.

30:42.441 --> 30:46.775
I don't want to be rude, but I'd prefer it
if you'd stay out of my family's problems.

30:46.946 --> 30:49.574
Believe me, Mr. Kent,
I'm not trying to pry, but...

30:49.749 --> 30:50.977
...Clark's my friend.

30:51.150 --> 30:53.243
I'd hate to see your relationship fall apart.

30:53.419 --> 30:55.751
I appreciate your concern...

30:55.922 --> 30:58.254
...but Clark and I can work this out.

30:58.491 --> 31:01.358
Then why is Clark hiding out
at the mansion?

31:16.242 --> 31:17.800
Lex?

31:19.579 --> 31:21.410
Is that you?

31:22.481 --> 31:24.073
Hey!

31:24.617 --> 31:26.517
Whoa, hey!

31:26.819 --> 31:28.252
What do you want?

31:28.554 --> 31:30.488
Lionel, go back to your room.

31:30.656 --> 31:33.454
Better yet, pack your bags
and get the hell out.

31:33.626 --> 31:35.594
I beg your pardon?

31:36.028 --> 31:38.588
Lex may be too afraid to tell you,
but I'm not.

31:38.764 --> 31:40.527
No one in Smallville wants you here.

31:40.700 --> 31:44.966
You seem to know a lot about me.
You got a name?

31:45.137 --> 31:48.868
- Clark Kent.
- Jonathan and Martha Kent's son?

31:49.542 --> 31:53.501
As far as I know, they're good people.
I'm astonished they've raised...

31:53.679 --> 31:56.409
...such a blatantly aggressive offspring.

31:56.582 --> 31:59.073
If you like them so much,
I'm sure they'll put you up.

31:59.251 --> 32:03.483
I hear they have a spare bedroom,
and I know they could use the cash.

32:03.689 --> 32:07.352
You've got a lot to learn about tact,
young man, but you speak your mind.

32:07.526 --> 32:09.494
That's good. It'll take you far.

32:09.662 --> 32:11.425
I'm going to the top.

32:12.632 --> 32:14.031
- Mr. Luthor?
- Yes.

32:14.200 --> 32:18.068
I apologize for the interruption.
I'm a federal marshal. Your people let me in.

32:18.270 --> 32:19.532
What can I do for you?

32:19.705 --> 32:23.698
This man was seen last night leaving the
scene of a disturbance in your son's Ferrari.

32:24.377 --> 32:27.744
Was that while you were
on your way to the top, Clark?

32:27.913 --> 32:30.006
Where can I find this girl?

32:31.717 --> 32:33.241
I've never seen her before.

32:40.359 --> 32:42.054
Is that supposed to scare me?

32:45.297 --> 32:47.197
How'd you do that?

32:48.534 --> 32:51.560
You've got no idea
who you're dealing with.

32:53.105 --> 32:55.232
What's happening?

32:58.911 --> 33:01.379
- Who's shooting?
- Don't worry, Lionel...

33:01.547 --> 33:03.310
...he missed.

33:06.118 --> 33:07.642
I'll call security.

33:11.657 --> 33:13.215
Why are you looking for Jessie?

33:13.392 --> 33:16.919
It's not her, it's her father. They were
witness protection. They rabbited.

33:17.096 --> 33:18.859
- Why?
- He's a corporate whistle-blower.

33:19.031 --> 33:22.489
His former employer offered me
a million dollars if I could get evidence.

33:22.668 --> 33:24.260
What kind of evidence?

33:24.437 --> 33:28.965
Computer disks, accounting files,
memos, endless smoking guns.

33:29.175 --> 33:32.508
Look, we can split it.
It's enough money to start a whole new life.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.737
That's a great idea...

33:35.114 --> 33:36.945
...but who needs you?

33:46.092 --> 33:49.289
Thought you forgot about me.
Ready to go?

33:49.462 --> 33:51.123
Almost.

33:51.297 --> 33:54.391
I know about your father,
Jessie, and the disks.

33:54.567 --> 33:57.092
We're not going
anywhere until I have them.

34:06.045 --> 34:08.706
I don't understand. Why are you doing this?

34:08.880 --> 34:10.313
The money.

34:10.483 --> 34:12.542
You said you wanted to leave this town...

34:12.717 --> 34:16.347
...and a million dollars is more than
enough money to make a fresh start.

34:16.554 --> 34:19.524
If I give you those disks,
my dad is a dead man.

34:19.692 --> 34:22.058
He was dead when he started running.

34:22.228 --> 34:25.061
- Didn't I tell you I didn't want to split?
- You need me, kid.

34:25.231 --> 34:29.327
I know the players, how to get the money.
Now give him the disks, Jessica!

34:48.286 --> 34:52.382
I don't want to hurt you, son.
But I will. Get out.

34:52.558 --> 34:54.650
Just like my dad...

34:54.827 --> 34:57.227
...always telling me what to do.

34:58.164 --> 35:00.223
I don't listen to him.

35:00.399 --> 35:02.890
What makes you think
I'm gonna listen to you?

35:07.072 --> 35:09.063
Where are the disks?

35:09.975 --> 35:13.843
In the floorboards? In the ceiling?

35:14.146 --> 35:15.807
In here?

35:20.519 --> 35:23.750
Doesn't really matter.
I'll figure it out one way or another.

35:30.930 --> 35:33.899
So why don't you save yourself
a lot of pain...

35:34.066 --> 35:35.556
...and make it sooner.

35:35.734 --> 35:39.898
You can kill me, you can tear this house
to the ground, you won't find those disks.

35:41.740 --> 35:42.968
Jessie.

36:00.593 --> 36:02.754
Please don't do this.

36:05.431 --> 36:09.265
I never realized how easy it would be
to get everything I've ever wanted.

36:10.002 --> 36:11.492
Clark!

36:11.670 --> 36:13.160
Pete?

36:13.339 --> 36:17.742
- It take the whole study group to find me?
- No. Lionel Luthor heard you mention Jessie.

36:17.910 --> 36:19.468
Jessie, run!

36:21.881 --> 36:25.112
How far is she gonna get, Pete?
A mile or two?

36:25.284 --> 36:27.912
You know no one can get away from me.

36:28.621 --> 36:29.986
Clark!

36:34.093 --> 36:37.824
- I won't let you hurt anybody else.
- Still trying to tell me what to do.

36:40.065 --> 36:42.056
Are you scared?

36:43.869 --> 36:46.133
Then again,
you and Mom were always afraid of me.

36:46.305 --> 36:49.468
No. We've had nothing but love for you.

36:49.875 --> 36:52.605
That makes what I'm about to do
all that more difficult.

36:53.279 --> 36:54.576
Pete.

36:54.747 --> 36:56.271
Do it.

37:00.252 --> 37:01.549
Pete.

37:01.754 --> 37:03.517
Clark, I'm sorry.

37:05.190 --> 37:06.782
Clark!

37:29.782 --> 37:31.374
Dad?

37:32.351 --> 37:35.343
It's okay, son. It's all right.

37:35.521 --> 37:37.113
You okay, man?

37:37.389 --> 37:39.323
Thanks, Pete.

37:41.193 --> 37:42.888
Who is that?

37:43.929 --> 37:46.295
What's...? What's going on?

37:47.900 --> 37:49.492
Lex?

37:50.202 --> 37:51.669
What's going on in here?

37:51.837 --> 37:56.570
What...? I didn't order
any more work to be done.

37:57.443 --> 38:00.742
- I'm putting the office back the way it was.
- You...

38:01.313 --> 38:03.281
Have a drink, Dad.

38:11.223 --> 38:13.248
Bas Armagnac, 1963?

38:17.196 --> 38:18.788
It's my favorite.

38:18.964 --> 38:23.060
There was a time when I thought our taste
in brandy was all we had in common.

38:23.235 --> 38:24.259
And now?

38:24.436 --> 38:27.269
I've been thinking about the months
after the meteor shower...

38:27.439 --> 38:28.872
...the way people looked at me.

38:29.041 --> 38:31.271
A baldheaded boy, thinking I was a freak.

38:31.443 --> 38:34.469
Please, Lex, not another tale of your
tortured youth and how I...

38:34.646 --> 38:36.409
How I failed you as a father...

38:36.582 --> 38:38.880
Actually, you gave me
some excellent advice.

38:39.051 --> 38:42.020
You told me to stop feeling sorry for myself.

38:42.187 --> 38:46.521
These were the cards fate had dealt me.
It was best that I accept it and move on.

38:50.462 --> 38:55.092
Stop acting like your blindness
gives you an excuse for self-pity.

38:58.037 --> 39:00.062
So the son becomes the father.

39:00.239 --> 39:01.831
No, Dad.

39:02.107 --> 39:05.076
I'm through indulging you like a child.

39:05.244 --> 39:09.704
My office remains my office.
You don't like it, leave.

39:09.882 --> 39:15.650
Well. Seems I have done a better job
of raising you than I thought.

39:16.121 --> 39:18.214
Or perhaps...

39:18.390 --> 39:23.225
...you've finally learned the value
of directness from your friend...

39:23.395 --> 39:24.623
...Clark Kent.

39:25.064 --> 39:28.192
He's a very interesting young man.

39:37.276 --> 39:38.937
- Hi.
- Hey.

39:42.347 --> 39:44.975
- Here.
- Thanks.

39:46.885 --> 39:49.251
I went by Jessie's.
They've completely cleared out.

39:49.421 --> 39:53.016
Well, maybe they stopped running
and have gone to the authorities.

39:54.126 --> 39:56.458
I just hope she's all right.

40:03.102 --> 40:06.799
You know, Dad, the things that I did
and I said, I really didn't mean them.

40:07.172 --> 40:08.503
Clark...

40:08.674 --> 40:12.303
...the red meteor rocks might have
affected your personality, but...

40:12.778 --> 40:15.770
...we gotta face it,
those feelings all came from somewhere.

40:15.948 --> 40:19.907
Now, I know compared to Lex, we don't
have a whole lot around here, but...

40:20.085 --> 40:22.883
...up until now, I never
really thought it bothered you.

40:23.122 --> 40:24.419
Maybe it does.

40:26.091 --> 40:28.025
Sometimes.

40:28.827 --> 40:31.159
And then I remember
what's really important...

40:31.330 --> 40:33.958
...and none of that matters.
No matter how crazy I got...

40:34.133 --> 40:37.899
...you two stood by me. That's something
all the money in the world can't buy.

40:45.144 --> 40:49.080
- But, still, it was a very close call, son.
- I know.

40:50.149 --> 40:54.210
When I put that ring on, I felt this sudden
urge to tell the whole world my secret.

40:54.386 --> 40:57.219
- Lex, Lana, Jessie.
- But you didn't, Clark.

40:57.389 --> 40:59.914
I know, but the feelings are still there.

41:00.092 --> 41:03.789
It's like I have these two identities
and I don't know which one's the real me.

41:03.962 --> 41:06.487
The real you is the one
who came back to us...

41:06.665 --> 41:09.793
...and we never had any doubt
that you would.

41:29.588 --> 41:34.150
Nell told me you were riding, that this
is one of your favorite places. It's pretty.

41:35.027 --> 41:37.928
I got a little lost along the way, but...

41:38.830 --> 41:40.457
...here I am.

41:40.966 --> 41:42.263
Those for me?

41:43.035 --> 41:44.662
Yeah.

41:44.937 --> 41:46.598
I wanted to apologize.

41:46.772 --> 41:50.401
I was hoping maybe we could be friends,
like we were before.

41:51.543 --> 41:55.604
So you thought that if you brought me
flowers, I'd pretend like nothing happened?

41:56.615 --> 42:00.051
You have to believe me.
The things I said, the way I was acting...

42:00.219 --> 42:01.811
...that wasn't me.

42:01.987 --> 42:04.785
Even the part where you said
you had feelings for me?

42:06.291 --> 42:07.622
- Lana...
- Clark...

42:07.793 --> 42:11.320
...you can't have it both ways.
Either it was you, or it wasn't.

42:15.467 --> 42:18.163
Wish I could explain, but I can't.

42:18.837 --> 42:21.203
Story of your life.

42:25.377 --> 42:27.242
Lana...

42:27.412 --> 42:29.346
...I really am sorry.

42:29.715 --> 42:31.740
I know you are.

42:32.117 --> 42:34.381
It's not enough anymore.

42:37.389 --> 42:39.914
Do you think you can
find your way home?

42:42.694 --> 42:44.389
Hope so.
