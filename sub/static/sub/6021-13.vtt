WEBVTT

00:03.703 --> 00:05.193
So you're saying UNICEF
is a scam?

00:05.372 --> 00:08.034
It's the perfect cover
for a money-laundering operation.

00:08.208 --> 00:10.199
No one could keep track
of all those kids...

00:10.377 --> 00:12.641
...with those little orange boxes
of change.

00:12.812 --> 00:15.372
Oh, no. It's Sally Weaver.

00:15.548 --> 00:17.880
Oh, yeah,
your old college roommate, huh?

00:18.051 --> 00:20.781
No, it's Susan Ross'
old college roommate.

00:20.954 --> 00:23.946
She moved to New York.
She's trying to become an actress.

00:24.124 --> 00:25.284
Dramatic or comedic?

00:25.458 --> 00:27.926
Untalented.
She's always inviting me to see her...

00:28.094 --> 00:30.824
...in some bad play in a tiny room
without ventilation.

00:30.997 --> 00:32.328
It's really depressing.

00:32.499 --> 00:34.558
Well, we don't go to enough theater.

00:34.734 --> 00:37.362
She should just give up.

00:38.238 --> 00:39.762
-Hey.
-Hey there...

00:39.939 --> 00:42.203
...Mr.
Too-Big-to-Come-to-My-Shows.

00:42.375 --> 00:44.969
I just came from tap. I'm all:

00:45.145 --> 00:48.308
I'm on my way to an audition,
still looking for that big break.

00:48.481 --> 00:50.972
Why don't you just give up?

00:51.484 --> 00:52.542
Kramer.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.619
Well, that's what Jerry says.

00:56.489 --> 00:59.424
Oh, now, face it. If it hasn't happened,
it's not gonna happen.

00:59.592 --> 01:03.892
All right. Now, go grab us a booth.
Join us?

01:07.767 --> 01:10.634
So Susan's dead.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:19.212 --> 01:21.510
Well, I think she was happy
someone finally said it.

01:21.681 --> 01:23.808
Why did you have to say
anything to her?

01:23.983 --> 01:26.816
Well, I felt the conversation
was lagging.

01:26.986 --> 01:29.614
Why can't you ever just keep
your big mouth shut?

01:30.523 --> 01:32.320
I come in here to have
a pleasant meal...

01:32.492 --> 01:35.791
...and if we're not gonna have one,
I'll grab a bite to eat at your place.

01:39.332 --> 01:40.856
You know, maybe Kramer was right.

01:41.034 --> 01:42.968
Some people should just give up.
I have.

01:43.136 --> 01:45.229
-What did you wanna be?
-I don't remember...

01:45.405 --> 01:47.771
...but it certainly wasn't this.

01:48.908 --> 01:50.739
Look at this cartoon
in <i>The New Yorker.</i>

01:50.910 --> 01:53.208
-I don't get this.
-Me neither.

01:53.379 --> 01:55.677
And you're on the fringe
of the humor business.

01:56.583 --> 01:57.880
Hey.

01:58.051 --> 02:00.076
Hey, George, look at this.

02:00.820 --> 02:02.151
-That's cute.
-You get it?

02:03.089 --> 02:04.681
No, never mind.

02:05.692 --> 02:08.160
Come on.
We're two intelligent people here.

02:08.328 --> 02:09.794
We can figure this out.

02:12.765 --> 02:15.700
Now, we got a dog
and a cat in an office.

02:15.869 --> 02:19.737
It looks like my accountant's office.
There's no pets working there.

02:20.240 --> 02:23.539
The cat is saying, "I've enjoyed
reading your e-mail."

02:23.710 --> 02:26.042
It's got something to do
with that 42 in the corner.

02:26.212 --> 02:28.237
That's a page number.

02:29.649 --> 02:31.583
Well, I can't crack this one.

02:31.751 --> 02:33.412
Oh, this has gotta be a mistake.

02:33.586 --> 02:34.883
Well, try shaking it.

02:38.258 --> 02:40.749
Well, Janet should be here
any minute.

02:40.927 --> 02:43.122
You've been hiding her.
You must really like her.

02:43.296 --> 02:45.764
Jerry, the minute I saw this girl,
we just clicked.

02:45.932 --> 02:48.423
She's got such a nice face.

02:48.601 --> 02:50.933
Her eyes, her mouth, nose.

02:51.104 --> 02:52.901
We know what a face consists of.

02:54.274 --> 02:56.242
I'm sorry I'm late.

02:56.409 --> 02:59.344
Jerry, Elaine, I give you Janet.

02:59.512 --> 03:00.536
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

03:00.713 --> 03:02.908
Hi. Do we still have time
to make the movie?

03:03.082 --> 03:04.344
Oh, yeah.

03:04.517 --> 03:07.714
We just can't go to the supermarket
to get some candy.

03:15.895 --> 03:19.353
Jerry, she looks exactly like you.

03:19.532 --> 03:20.897
She does not.

03:21.935 --> 03:24.335
You know, maybe she doesn't.
I don't care.

03:27.273 --> 03:29.969
-Hey, Kramer.
-Well, hey. You got some messages.

03:30.143 --> 03:33.544
Yeah. George, George, Elaine.
George again.

03:33.713 --> 03:36.944
Elaine. Newman.
But that was a crank call.

03:37.584 --> 03:40.553
Yeah, and some Sally woman called,
says thanks a lot.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.553
Yeah, she's quitting the business.
You ruined her life.

03:44.090 --> 03:46.650
What?
You're the one who ruined her life.

03:46.826 --> 03:49.294
Well, that's not how
she remembers it.

03:49.462 --> 03:51.293
Well, I gotta talk her out of this.

03:51.464 --> 03:53.227
I thought you said she stinks.

03:53.399 --> 03:56.562
She does stink.
And she should quit.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.567
But I don't want it to be
because of me.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.365
It should be the traditional route.

04:00.540 --> 04:02.132
Years of rejection and failure...

04:02.308 --> 04:05.243
...until she's spit out
the bottom of the porn industry.

04:08.147 --> 04:10.411
-Yeah.
-<i>Hey, George and Janet.</i>

04:10.583 --> 04:13.518
-Oh, who's Janet, huh?
-George's girlfriend.

04:13.686 --> 04:15.586
Elaine thinks she looks like me...

04:15.755 --> 04:18.315
...but I think it's, as you would say,
kooky talk.

04:18.925 --> 04:21.257
You know what woman
I always thought you looked like?

04:21.427 --> 04:23.452
Lena Horne.

04:25.798 --> 04:27.390
-Hey. Hey.
-Hey, George.

04:27.567 --> 04:29.762
And you must look
exactly like Jerry.

04:32.171 --> 04:35.004
You don't see this?
Oh, you're like twins.

04:35.642 --> 04:37.166
This is eerie.

04:38.511 --> 04:40.945
Kramer, what are you talking about?

04:41.114 --> 04:43.139
Janet doesn't look anything
like Jerry.

04:43.316 --> 04:45.147
Maybe we do look
a little like each other.

04:45.318 --> 04:48.617
No, what do you know
about what you look like?

04:49.022 --> 04:51.684
Come on, George. Relax.
Just because they look alike...

04:51.858 --> 04:54.884
...that doesn't mean
you're secretly in love with Jerry.

04:57.363 --> 04:59.092
All right, we're going now. Bye-bye.

04:59.265 --> 05:03.099
-We just got here, George.
-Well, it's getting dark.

05:05.705 --> 05:08.868
Yeah, she's a nice girl,
kind of quiet, though.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.839
What are you doing?

05:11.010 --> 05:13.205
Don't tell a woman
she looks like a man.

05:13.379 --> 05:17.076
George doesn't wanna hear his
girlfriend looks like me, neither do l.

05:17.650 --> 05:20.551
Well, how should I have broached
the subject?

05:20.720 --> 05:24.156
You don't broach.
You keep your mouth shut.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.315
Well, sounds like someone's
having a bad day.

05:26.492 --> 05:28.084
Yeah, because of you.

05:28.261 --> 05:31.355
Well, then I think one of us
should leave.

05:43.142 --> 05:44.905
Sally, you can't quit the business.

05:45.078 --> 05:46.409
This is all because of me?

05:48.047 --> 05:51.608
You can't give up.
You don't think people tell me I stink?

05:51.784 --> 05:53.615
When I'm on-stage that's all I hear.

05:53.786 --> 05:56.880
"You stink. You suck.
We like magic."

05:58.057 --> 05:59.752
-Really?
-Of course.

05:59.926 --> 06:03.794
I stink. You stink. It's show biz.
Everybody stinks.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.855
Yeah, you've been stinking
since the '80s.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.933
All right, I think we've covered
my act.

06:09.102 --> 06:11.764
Now, you get out there
and stink it up with everybody else.

06:11.938 --> 06:15.874
All right. Yes.
Thank you. I'm gonna do it.

06:18.077 --> 06:19.840
Now.

06:23.416 --> 06:27.443
Well, I've asked everyone at work
and no one gets this cartoon.

06:27.620 --> 06:30.987
I don't understand why, but I am
gonna get to the bottom of this.

06:31.157 --> 06:33.250
Oh, I think we're at the bottom.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.492
Hey, George.
Janet seems really nice.

06:38.464 --> 06:42.696
And she's quite
a handsome woman.

06:45.004 --> 06:47.165
-What does that mean?
-Yeah, what does that mean?

06:47.340 --> 06:49.171
What do you mean by that?

06:49.342 --> 06:51.139
Enjoy.

06:54.914 --> 06:59.078
-Elaine, huh? She's completely--
-Oh, I know.

06:59.852 --> 07:03.413
-Because you don't think Janet--
-No.

07:03.823 --> 07:05.256
-Why would l?
-It's ludicrous.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.414
Yes.

07:06.592 --> 07:07.616
-Neither one of us.
-No.

07:07.794 --> 07:09.728
-So.
-Exactly.

07:10.863 --> 07:12.353
I'm not gay.

07:15.368 --> 07:16.995
Neither am l.

07:19.872 --> 07:22.568
-Kramer, get in here.
-Kramer. Kramer.

07:22.742 --> 07:24.266
Where's that crazy man? Come on.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.502
Kramer, come on in here.

07:25.678 --> 07:27.339
-Come on.
-Kramer, what are you doing?

07:27.513 --> 07:29.538
-Come in.
-Finally.

07:29.782 --> 07:31.773
What are you doing?
Come and talk to us.

07:33.586 --> 07:35.315
I've made an important life decision.

07:35.488 --> 07:38.321
-Let's talk about that.
-Don't leave.

07:39.025 --> 07:43.519
All right. I know I've been kind
of shooting off at the mouth lately.

07:43.696 --> 07:47.564
First, with that girl whose life
you destroyed...

07:47.733 --> 07:50.361
...and then about George
dating a lady Jerry.

07:51.170 --> 07:52.569
What's the decision?

07:52.738 --> 07:54.865
I know you want me
to keep my big mouth shut.

07:55.041 --> 07:56.804
Well, that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

07:56.976 --> 07:59.501
-I'm never gonna talk again.
-Yeah, right.

07:59.679 --> 08:03.115
What do I need to talk for, huh?
What, to blab to the neighbors...

08:03.282 --> 08:06.615
...about how George
has a new fem-Jerry friend?

08:06.786 --> 08:10.187
Or to tell everybody at the coffee shop
how George is all mixed up...

08:10.356 --> 08:14.053
...in a perverse sexual amalgam
of some girl and his best friend?

08:15.995 --> 08:18.156
See, now, I've done all that.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.265
Now, it's time for silence.

08:20.433 --> 08:23.095
Silence? Yes.

08:23.436 --> 08:25.961
You're never gonna be able
to completely stop talking.

08:26.138 --> 08:29.596
Jerry, 94 percent
of communication is nonverbal.

08:29.775 --> 08:31.606
Here, watch.

08:33.980 --> 08:36.210
<i>What? What are you talking about?</i>

08:41.087 --> 08:42.577
Well, what does this mean?

08:42.755 --> 08:44.746
Well, it's Frank
and Estelle's reaction...

08:44.924 --> 08:47.791
...to hearing about George's
man love for a she-Jerry.

08:48.628 --> 08:53.588
-Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
-That's the idea.

08:53.766 --> 08:56.098
Kramer, there's no way
you stick to this.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.898
-Oh, you're gonna start now?
-That's right.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.238
Right now.

09:03.876 --> 09:05.741
That hurts.

09:06.178 --> 09:07.736
Now.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.485
So J. Peterman wants to hire
some of our cartoonists...

09:13.653 --> 09:15.985
...to illustrate your catalog?

09:16.155 --> 09:19.488
Well, we're hoping that if,
perhaps the catalog is a little funnier...

09:19.659 --> 09:23.095
...people won't be so quick
to return the clothes.

09:24.897 --> 09:27.764
For example,
you know, I really do....

09:27.934 --> 09:30.129
Well, I love this one.

09:30.303 --> 09:33.500
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that's a rather clever jab...

09:33.673 --> 09:35.664
...at inter-office politics,
don't you think?

09:37.043 --> 09:38.533
Yeah.

09:41.847 --> 09:45.977
But why is it that the animals
enjoy reading the e-mail?

09:46.152 --> 09:47.380
Well, Miss Benes...

09:47.553 --> 09:52.820
...cartoons are like gossamer
and one doesn't dissect gossamer.

09:52.992 --> 09:55.517
Well, you don't have to dissect it...

09:55.695 --> 09:59.791
...if you could just tell me
why this is supposed to be funny.

09:59.966 --> 10:03.993
Oh, it's merely a commentary
on contemporary mores.

10:05.104 --> 10:08.005
But what is the comment?

10:09.508 --> 10:11.840
-It's a slice of life.
-No, it isn't.

10:12.011 --> 10:13.808
-A pun?
-I don't think so.

10:13.980 --> 10:15.311
Vorshtein?

10:16.382 --> 10:17.781
That's not a word.

10:19.118 --> 10:21.177
-You have no idea what this means.
-No.

10:21.354 --> 10:24.551
-Then why did you print it?
-I like the kitty.

10:25.024 --> 10:28.221
You know what? You people
should be ashamed of yourselves.

10:28.394 --> 10:31.625
You know, you doodle
a couple of bears at a cocktail party...

10:31.797 --> 10:35.062
...talking about the stock market,
you think you're doing comedy.

10:35.534 --> 10:37.229
Actually, that's not bad.

10:37.870 --> 10:42.807
Oh, really? Oh, yes.
Well, you know, I have others.

10:45.845 --> 10:48.541
Sally, I can't believe you're already
doing a one-woman show.

10:48.714 --> 10:50.875
No, it's just a little performance
piece I wrote.

10:51.050 --> 10:55.077
But you know what?
You really inspired me, okay, a tear.

10:57.223 --> 10:58.918
Hey, there you are.

11:00.359 --> 11:03.556
Oh, right. Code of silence.
How's that going?

11:10.069 --> 11:11.366
Thank you.

11:11.537 --> 11:13.528
Hi. I think you're really
gonna like this...

11:13.706 --> 11:16.698
...because it's about me.
Well, all right, it's not just about me.

11:16.876 --> 11:19.743
It's about me, and this guy,
Jerry Seinfeld...

11:21.714 --> 11:23.614
...who I like to call the devil.

11:24.383 --> 11:25.372
Okay, okay.

11:25.551 --> 11:29.078
So I run into this Jerry on the street
and then he says to me:

11:29.255 --> 11:31.917
"Hey, Sally, you stink.
You should give up acting."

11:32.091 --> 11:35.254
Oh, I'm doing Jerry now, okay?
So you have to imagine I have horns...

11:35.428 --> 11:38.022
...a tail and hooves instead of feet.

11:38.497 --> 11:40.590
You know what I mean,
that guy?

11:41.867 --> 11:43.892
Oh, shut up.

11:47.840 --> 11:50.707
She does a full hour
about how you're the devil?

11:50.876 --> 11:52.207
I gotta go see this thing.

11:52.378 --> 11:55.074
Good luck. It's sold out
for the next three weeks.

11:56.015 --> 12:01.214
Well, I bet I can get in, once I mention
I'm from <i>The New Yorker.</i>

12:01.387 --> 12:04.254
-<i>The New Yorker?</i>
-Yes. <i>The New Yorker.</i>

12:04.423 --> 12:06.186
I met with their cartoon editor...

12:06.358 --> 12:11.421
...and I got him to admit that
that cartoon made no sense.

12:11.931 --> 12:14.399
Wow, good work, Nancy Drew.

12:15.768 --> 12:17.463
So we ended up going out
to lunch...

12:17.636 --> 12:20.298
...and he had some great gossip
about James Thurber.

12:20.473 --> 12:21.940
Nodding off.

12:22.108 --> 12:26.238
And he said I could submit
some of my own cartoons.

12:26.412 --> 12:30.143
Wow, that's incredible,
but you don't draw.

12:30.716 --> 12:33.583
-I do too.
-What, your sad little horsies?

12:33.986 --> 12:36.147
The house with the little curl
of smoke.

12:36.322 --> 12:38.654
The sunflower with the smiley face.

12:38.824 --> 12:40.621
The transparent cube.

12:41.327 --> 12:44.490
It's better than your drawings
of naked Lois Lane.

12:44.663 --> 12:48.394
Where did you see that?
Those are private.

12:51.203 --> 12:52.670
Jerry, sorry I'm late.

12:52.838 --> 12:55.739
Channel Nine is doing a piece
on my show, isn't that great?

12:55.908 --> 12:57.432
Do you hate me?

12:57.610 --> 12:59.339
No, no, I thought the show
was terrific.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.707
I was just wondering
if you have to keep saying...

13:01.881 --> 13:03.872
...Jerry Seinfeld is the devil.

13:04.884 --> 13:06.545
Well, that is the title.

13:07.520 --> 13:11.479
I know, but I thought maybe you could
mention how I apologized...

13:11.657 --> 13:14.182
...and encouraged you
to stick with it?

13:14.360 --> 13:17.955
You know, I workshopped that
and snoozers.

13:18.964 --> 13:23.367
But I'll tell you what, I'll tinker.
It's all a journey.

13:23.969 --> 13:26.164
Thanks.
You got a little schmutz there.

13:27.339 --> 13:31.332
Excuse me, Miss Weaver?
Oh, my God, it is you.

13:31.510 --> 13:33.307
I've seen your show six times.

13:34.413 --> 13:36.381
What a surprise.

13:36.549 --> 13:38.016
You're great. It's great.

13:38.184 --> 13:41.585
It's so great to see
a show that's about something.

13:46.525 --> 13:47.992
Where to?

13:59.338 --> 14:01.033
<i>My friends are idiots.</i>

14:01.207 --> 14:04.574
<i>She doesn't look like Jerry.
She doesn't look like anybody.</i>

14:06.178 --> 14:08.078
<i>And so what if she does
look like Jerry?</i>

14:08.247 --> 14:09.236
<i>What does that mean?</i>

14:09.415 --> 14:11.406
<i>That I'd have everything
I have with Jerry...</i>

14:11.584 --> 14:15.020
<i>...but because it's a woman
I could also have sex with her?</i>

14:15.187 --> 14:19.214
<i>And that somehow, that would be
exactly what I always wanted?</i>

14:21.727 --> 14:23.854
<i>She doesn't even look like Jerry.</i>

14:24.029 --> 14:26.020
I really do look
a lot like your friend Jerry.

14:26.198 --> 14:27.631
I know.

14:32.304 --> 14:35.535
<i>Thanks for watching</i> Nine News.
<i>We leave you tonight with a scene...</i>

14:35.708 --> 14:37.699
<i>...from Sally Weaver's
one-woman show.</i>

14:37.877 --> 14:42.109
<i>Okay, so, I go to meet Jerry Seinfeld
at this horrible coffee shop, right?</i>

14:42.281 --> 14:43.908
<i>He's like, "Stop doing your show."</i>

14:44.083 --> 14:46.210
<i>And I'm like,
"Hello, it's a free country."</i>

14:46.385 --> 14:48.478
<i>So then he goes,
"Okay, schmutzie."</i>

14:48.654 --> 14:50.781
<i>Then he starts pawing
at my sweater, right?</i>

14:50.956 --> 14:52.651
<i>And getting all
"Hands Across America."</i>

14:52.825 --> 14:55.123
There really was schmutz.
I didn't try and grab her.

14:55.294 --> 14:58.593
<i>And this is what he looks like
when he is eating:</i>

15:00.699 --> 15:03.361
Get out of my house.

15:04.303 --> 15:07.397
Well, boys, I did it.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.131
I had to stay up all night...

15:09.308 --> 15:12.971
...but I finally came up
with a great <i>New Yorker</i> cartoon.

15:13.145 --> 15:17.013
If I stayed up all night, I'd fix myself up
a little before I go out.

15:18.284 --> 15:19.751
That is not the point.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.513
Some mouthwash, a hat,
something.

15:24.189 --> 15:26.589
Just read it.

15:27.793 --> 15:29.522
Pretty good.

15:29.695 --> 15:30.957
Pretty good?

15:31.130 --> 15:33.598
Well, this is a gem. Kramer, lookit.

15:36.201 --> 15:38.169
What? It's funny.

15:38.337 --> 15:40.271
It's a pig at a complaint department.

15:40.439 --> 15:45.206
Yeah, and he's saying,
"I wish I was taller."

15:46.178 --> 15:48.806
See? That's his complaint.

15:49.481 --> 15:51.312
-I get it.
-Do you?

15:51.483 --> 15:54.213
Because that's not a normal
complaint.

15:54.386 --> 15:56.286
Well, how about
if it was something like:

15:56.455 --> 15:58.980
"I can't find my receipt.
My place is a sty."

16:02.928 --> 16:06.989
You know, everything with you
has to be so jokey.

16:07.166 --> 16:09.259
I'm a comedian.

16:09.902 --> 16:14.396
"I wish I was taller." That's nice.
That's real.

16:14.573 --> 16:18.236
Yeah, well, I got a complaint.
This cartoon stinks.

16:20.212 --> 16:22.339
Well, I'll tell you
who doesn't think it stinks.

16:22.514 --> 16:25.677
<i>The New Yorker.</i> That's right.

16:25.851 --> 16:27.910
They're publishing it
in their next issue.

16:28.854 --> 16:31.516
Oh, you know what?
I just ran into Newman in the hall.

16:31.690 --> 16:34.090
He said you tried
to grope Sally Weaver?

16:34.593 --> 16:38.586
Oh, that's it.
I'm gonna put an end to this.

16:42.101 --> 16:45.764
"The pig says, 'My wife is a slut"'?

16:52.811 --> 16:55.006
Now, that's a complaint.

16:56.982 --> 16:59.849
Hello, this is Jerry.
I just wanted to leave you a message...

17:00.019 --> 17:02.351
...and let you know
I caught your little piece on TV.

17:02.521 --> 17:05.046
<i>I'm getting tired of hearing
about how horrible I am.</i>

17:05.223 --> 17:06.521
<i>I'd really appreciate it...</i>

17:06.692 --> 17:09.957
<i>...if you would just leave me out
of your act altogether.</i>

17:10.662 --> 17:13.529
Well, that's it.
I'm calling in the big guns.

17:14.066 --> 17:18.366
"--to cease and desist,
on behalf of my client, Jerry Seinfeld."

17:18.537 --> 17:21.700
Signed, crybaby
Jerry Seinfeld's lawyer.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.934
Okay. Well, I've got two words
for you, Jerry Seinfeld:

17:25.109 --> 17:27.907
<i>**** you.</i>

17:30.582 --> 17:33.050
How could she say that on TV?

17:33.218 --> 17:36.449
And how did she get a cable special?
I've never gotten a cable special.

17:38.490 --> 17:42.551
Well, that's it. I'm not giving her any
more material. We are incommunicado.

17:44.696 --> 17:46.596
Exactly.

17:49.301 --> 17:52.168
Check it out. From the new issue
of <i>The New Yorker.</i>

17:53.038 --> 17:55.802
-It's funny, isn't it?
-No.

17:55.974 --> 17:58.568
Look at it.
The pig wants to be taller.

17:58.744 --> 18:02.874
And what's this guy gonna say, huh?
Nothing.

18:03.982 --> 18:07.975
Elaine, I'm afraid I have incurred
yet another flat tire.

18:08.320 --> 18:09.810
Can I fix that after lunch, sir?

18:09.988 --> 18:11.353
Oh, no, right away. Chop-chop.

18:12.724 --> 18:17.423
A new cartoon. "I wish I was taller."

18:20.432 --> 18:23.299
I'd like to see
that complaint get rectified.

18:25.637 --> 18:28.162
You see? See?
Smart people think this is funny.

18:28.340 --> 18:31.673
And you wanna know why?
Because I wrote it.

18:31.844 --> 18:33.812
You shouldn't make fun of pigs.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.279
Flash of lightning, Elaine.

18:37.449 --> 18:39.644
I just realized
why I like this cartoon so much.

18:39.818 --> 18:42.685
-Oh, do tell, sir.
-It's a "Ziggy."

18:42.855 --> 18:43.947
A "Ziggy"?

18:44.123 --> 18:46.887
That irreverence. That wit.
I'd recognize it anywhere.

18:47.059 --> 18:49.084
Some charlatan
has stolen a "Ziggy"...

18:49.261 --> 18:52.697
...and passed it off
as his own and I can prove it.

18:52.865 --> 18:55.663
Quick, Elaine, to my archives.

19:02.207 --> 19:04.801
You know what's great
about our relationship?

19:04.977 --> 19:07.309
-It's not about looks.
-It's not?

19:07.479 --> 19:09.003
No, it can't be.

19:09.515 --> 19:10.573
Okay.

19:11.016 --> 19:13.177
For instance, I remember
when we first met...

19:13.352 --> 19:16.480
...we had a great conversation.

19:16.655 --> 19:19.818
I remember you said
I was the prettiest girl at the party.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.323
But then after that we really talked,
didn't we?

19:24.496 --> 19:26.361
Well, you told me how familiar
I looked...

19:26.532 --> 19:29.524
...and that you must have seen me
somewhere before.

19:32.471 --> 19:35.736
This relationship, it's got to be
about something.

19:35.908 --> 19:40.641
And fast, or I am in very serious
and weird trouble.

19:41.246 --> 19:43.806
-What else happened?
-You asked for a piece of gum...

19:43.982 --> 19:46.951
...because you thought
your breath smelled like hummus.

19:47.486 --> 19:49.818
All right. Yes. Gum.

19:49.988 --> 19:51.546
Good enough. I'll take it.

19:51.723 --> 19:53.588
-I like gum.
-I do too.

19:53.759 --> 19:55.488
You see, that's what we're about.

19:55.661 --> 19:59.859
You don't remind me of anyone
and we love gum.

20:00.032 --> 20:03.627
-I have gum in my hair.
-I'm losing it.

20:09.508 --> 20:12.443
Hey, you're Jerry's friend.
You're kooky. Mind if I sit?

20:12.611 --> 20:14.602
My show is going well.
Have you seen it yet?

20:14.780 --> 20:16.645
You should.
Everybody else in town has.

20:16.815 --> 20:18.373
I got recognized the other day.

20:18.550 --> 20:21.212
How weird is that? I know.
At first I liked the attention.

20:21.386 --> 20:24.822
But after a while it's like, "Whoa, take
three steps back. Get a life," okay?

20:24.990 --> 20:27.481
There wouldn't be a Sally Weaver
without the fans.

20:27.659 --> 20:30.355
But who am l, anyway? I mean,
there's Sally Weaver the woman.

20:30.529 --> 20:32.258
Sally Weaver the artist.
Sally Weaver--

20:32.431 --> 20:34.262
You know, you've gotta shut up.

20:36.969 --> 20:39.904
I'm sorry. I haven't spoken in days.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.973
Well, lay it on me, string bean.

20:43.675 --> 20:47.475
Let me get this gum out of my hair
and then I'll be ready for bed.

20:47.646 --> 20:50.615
Okay, look, the gum
isn't cutting it for me.

20:50.782 --> 20:55.947
We need to be about something else.
Anything. Please.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.321
George.

21:00.492 --> 21:03.120
-Your hair.
-Well, I had to cut the gum out...

21:03.295 --> 21:06.059
...and I had a little trouble
getting it even.

21:06.431 --> 21:08.422
So why don't you get undressed,
George?

21:10.669 --> 21:13.331
George is in weird trouble.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.807
You ripped off a "Ziggy"?

21:18.977 --> 21:21.844
It must have seeped into
my subconscious.

21:22.014 --> 21:24.778
Puddy has "Ziggy" bed sheets.

21:25.917 --> 21:28.784
Did you read the comics today?

21:28.954 --> 21:32.014
Oh, I see Ziggy's back
at the complaint department.

21:32.190 --> 21:35.318
"<i>The New Yorker</i>
is stealing my ideas."

21:36.061 --> 21:37.460
See, that's funny...

21:38.463 --> 21:40.192
...because it's real.

21:40.832 --> 21:43.130
Hey, lookit. Sally's cable show's on.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.463
Hey, Kramer, come on in.
You gotta watch this.

21:45.637 --> 21:47.867
This'll be funny.
Now, she's got nothing.

21:48.040 --> 21:51.703
<i>Master of evil, Jerry Seinfeld,
broke off all contact with me.</i>

21:51.877 --> 21:54.641
That's right, sister.
Why don't you just give up?

21:54.813 --> 21:57.213
Why are you yelling at the TV?

21:57.382 --> 21:58.440
<i>Okay, get this.</i>

21:58.617 --> 22:00.642
<i>I heard he makes
his best friend date women...</i>

22:00.819 --> 22:02.309
<i>...who look just like him.</i>

22:02.921 --> 22:04.411
<i>Hello? Issues.</i>

22:04.589 --> 22:06.284
Elaine, have you been talking
to her?

22:06.458 --> 22:08.255
Hey, I'm just a fan.

22:08.427 --> 22:09.792
<i>Oh, and speaking of issues...</i>

22:09.961 --> 22:11.690
<i>...guess who got
a no-polish manicure...</i>

22:11.863 --> 22:15.094
<i>...and begged his neighbor
not to tell anyone.</i>

22:17.869 --> 22:20.064
I thought you stopped talking.

22:20.238 --> 22:22.763
All right, starting now.

22:30.816 --> 22:32.875
You broke up with her
because she cut her hair?

22:33.051 --> 22:34.177
How short?

22:34.820 --> 22:35.878
Like that.

22:37.255 --> 22:39.450
-You mean like--?
-That.

22:40.559 --> 22:42.117
-So she--
-Yes.

22:42.294 --> 22:43.283
-And you don't--
-No.

22:43.462 --> 22:45.396
-So.
-Exactly.

22:47.866 --> 22:52.064
We must never ever speak
of this again.

22:52.237 --> 22:53.261
No.

22:58.410 --> 22:59.934
Hey, you wanna go see a movie?

23:00.645 --> 23:02.806
Actually, I think I'm gonna take
a few days off.

23:04.583 --> 23:07.074
-I think that's for the best.
-Yeah.
