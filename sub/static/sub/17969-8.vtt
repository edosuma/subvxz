WEBVTT

00:25.659 --> 00:30.665
So let me get this straight. You just
woke up and your symptoms had regressed?

00:30.831 --> 00:34.244
Not regressed, vanished. No
lesions, no fever, no black mucus.

00:34.401 --> 00:37.075
That's...
God, this is good.

00:37.237 --> 00:40.013
Unbelievable. Like I was never
infected in the first place.

00:40.173 --> 00:43.814
Hate to say it, but the virus could be
entering a latent stage, going dormant.

00:43.977 --> 00:47.322
Lysogenesis. At first I thought
that too, but I feel so good.

00:47.481 --> 00:50.052
Are you gonna eat that?
Please, help yourself.

00:51.485 --> 00:53.396
Sure hasn't hurt your appetite at all.

00:53.554 --> 00:56.558
So you're not feeling
any other symptoms?

00:58.191 --> 01:00.330
Alan, for God's sake, I'm fine.

01:00.494 --> 01:03.100
In fact, I have never felt so good.

01:09.570 --> 01:12.210
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Jules.

01:12.372 --> 01:15.046
- Jules. Jules.
- Pin her back.

01:15.842 --> 01:17.378
Pin her back.

01:29.022 --> 01:30.467
No, no, no, it's not funny.

01:30.624 --> 01:33.195
Not goddamn funny.
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:33.360 --> 01:35.567
I'm sorry, I couldn't resist.

01:35.729 --> 01:38.733
Unbelievable.
Okay, okay.

01:38.899 --> 01:41.573
As soon as I finish this,
I'm gonna get back to the lab,

01:41.735 --> 01:45.410
run a full panel of myself,
CBC, coags, viral screen, the works.

01:45.572 --> 01:48.883
If I developed antibodies
that fight off the virus, it'd help others.

01:49.042 --> 01:51.283
I don't want you near the lab
until we confirm

01:51.445 --> 01:54.983
every trace of this virus is out of
your body. Remember Bucharest, 2002.

01:55.148 --> 01:57.754
What happened in Bucharest?
Meningitis outbreak.

01:57.918 --> 01:59.795
The aid workers
were hoarding a vaccine.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.058
Crowd stormed the center,
nearly killed them.

02:02.222 --> 02:05.101
If anyone gets wind
of your recovery,

02:05.258 --> 02:07.260
they may think
we've come up with a cure.

02:07.427 --> 02:08.997
I want you to keep
a low profile,

02:09.162 --> 02:11.301
especially with Sutton
roaming the halls.

02:11.465 --> 02:15.436
Sutton? Hatake warned me about her.
He doesn't trust her either.

02:15.602 --> 02:18.139
He said that? When?
When we were down on Level R.

02:19.306 --> 02:20.944
He was down there? With you?

02:21.642 --> 02:24.248
He helped me get back up here.

02:24.411 --> 02:25.481
I thought you knew.

02:28.248 --> 02:29.420
Contamination.

02:29.583 --> 02:32.621
Sarah, when finished with the
collection, get to the lab.

02:32.786 --> 02:35.164
Jules, sit tight, I'll check back
as soon as I can.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.302
I don't wanna lose
anyone else today.

02:41.528 --> 02:44.099
- What happened?
- Vector attack.

02:44.264 --> 02:47.006
Anybody hurl? Infected?
We got lucky.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.647
My men chased him down,
cornered him in here.

02:49.803 --> 02:53.012
Did they corner him
or did he lead them in here?

02:53.974 --> 02:56.477
You think he wanted to
contaminate the food supply?

02:56.643 --> 03:01.786
Why infect us one-by-one
when they could starve us en masse?

03:06.353 --> 03:09.163
There's bleach,
disinfecting supplies in the airlock.

03:09.322 --> 03:11.393
I want you to spray down
this entire room

03:11.558 --> 03:15.062
after you've taken everything out in
biohazard containers, destroyed it.

03:15.228 --> 03:18.539
I don't want anyone consuming
contaminated foodstuffs in a panic.

03:18.699 --> 03:21.703
Let's lock down this sector
while we sterilize.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.815
- Anyone asks, it's routine maintenance.
- Yes, sir.

03:24.971 --> 03:28.851
Now that Hatake's been detained,
are you still acting on his behalf?

03:29.009 --> 03:30.989
Hatake is no longer
in charge of this base.

03:31.144 --> 03:32.521
What about emergency rations?

03:32.679 --> 03:35.216
Hatake must have hidden reserves
throughout the base.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.252
Go ask him yourself.

03:48.729 --> 03:51.073
I'd better stop or you'll need
a blood transfusion.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.778
I'm glad to see you're
in such a good mood, though.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.609
We can use some of that
around here.

03:58.739 --> 04:01.583
I feel better than I have
in a long time.

04:02.175 --> 04:04.382
Are you experiencing
any other symptoms?

04:06.346 --> 04:08.292
Light sensitivity.

04:08.448 --> 04:10.257
Bad?
Heh.

04:10.417 --> 04:11.862
You have no idea.

04:14.855 --> 04:16.892
Are you wearing colored contacts?

04:19.593 --> 04:21.129
Can I trust you to keep a secret?

04:22.796 --> 04:26.107
I mean, I'd say it dies with me, but...
Good enough.

04:39.312 --> 04:40.484
Holy...

05:01.268 --> 05:03.976
I heard the alarm. ls there
anything I need to attend to?

05:04.137 --> 05:07.516
Vector got in the food supply. We lost
most of the dry goods along with...

05:07.674 --> 05:09.312
A simple yes or no will do.

05:10.076 --> 05:11.453
No, ma'am, it's under control.

05:12.679 --> 05:13.953
Hm.

05:14.347 --> 05:18.124
Perhaps "under control"
is not in our best interests.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.458
Ma'am?
Our CDC team is trained

05:21.621 --> 05:22.964
to perform under pressure.

05:23.123 --> 05:26.764
I may have failed to provide them
with the optimal conditions for success.

05:26.927 --> 05:29.305
What would you like me
to have the men do?

05:30.263 --> 05:33.506
Have them do nothing.
Allow the vectors to run free.

05:33.667 --> 05:36.273
We'll see if fear inspires creativity.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.205
Anything else?

05:43.176 --> 05:45.053
I'm good at my job, aren't I?

05:46.980 --> 05:51.019
Unquestionably.
Usually I can assess any situation,

05:51.184 --> 05:54.290
immediately determine
what is important and what is not.

05:54.454 --> 05:56.525
I ascribe value, Klein.

05:56.690 --> 06:02.003
So why can I not find the value
in this Julia Walker?

06:05.665 --> 06:07.372
Speak freely.

06:08.001 --> 06:09.878
Can't be you.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.845
Must be the situation.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.580
Thank you.

06:20.647 --> 06:21.751
And, Klein...

06:32.525 --> 06:34.095
Code 127 double G...

06:34.261 --> 06:37.333
This is ridiculous. Why am I
dressed up for nerd prom?

06:37.497 --> 06:40.171
You're trying to blend in.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.176
I need Sutton to see me
doing her work

06:42.335 --> 06:44.906
so we can continue
to move around the base freely.

06:45.572 --> 06:48.212
What are you looking at?
Stop that.

06:48.375 --> 06:50.355
What?
Being yourself.

06:50.510 --> 06:53.582
I missed you too, Miksa.
My name's Daniel.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.624
Okay, Daniel.

06:55.782 --> 06:57.386
So how is it you never realized

06:57.550 --> 06:59.928
your playmates kept
disappearing from this place?

07:00.086 --> 07:03.693
Hatake lied to me. Why wouldn't
I believe the man who adopted me?

07:03.857 --> 07:05.859
If you don't know,
talk to someone who does.

07:06.026 --> 07:08.370
Hatake's not gonna
tell you anything.

07:09.296 --> 07:10.934
I'm not talking about Hatake.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.479
What did you do?

07:21.641 --> 07:23.416
You have to be more specific.

07:23.576 --> 07:26.557
What did you do to Julia
down on Level R?

07:27.147 --> 07:28.558
Do you have a cure?

07:28.982 --> 07:30.586
There is no cure.

07:31.051 --> 07:34.498
What happened to Dr. Walker
was not my doing.

07:35.488 --> 07:38.992
I don't believe you.
It doesn't matter what you believe.

07:39.159 --> 07:44.268
Dr. Walker is virus-free,
and that puts her in grave danger.

07:45.799 --> 07:49.804
From whom? Sutton?
From Sutton, from everyone.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.574
And not just at this base.

07:53.139 --> 07:57.178
If she is the only person in the world
to have beaten the virus...

07:58.611 --> 08:02.320
Then she'll be experimented on
for the rest of her life.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.519
Go. Now.

08:04.684 --> 08:05.992
Don't leave her side.

08:17.430 --> 08:19.000
Alan?

08:25.972 --> 08:27.349
Dr. Walker, I presume?

08:27.874 --> 08:29.444
I'm Constance Sutton.

08:29.609 --> 08:32.179
I've been so looking forward
to meeting you.

08:33.813 --> 08:37.488
My, what beautiful eyes you have.

08:42.355 --> 08:45.802
What's going on? I wanna see Dr. Wa...
Nobody in or out. Sutton's orders.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.629
Why?
Talk to Sutton.

08:49.496 --> 08:52.409
I need Walker in the lab.
Talk to Sutton.

08:55.468 --> 08:57.311
Alan.

08:57.670 --> 08:59.707
Hey, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

08:59.873 --> 09:03.150
I need to speak to Dr. Walker.
Dr. Walker is no longer your concern.

09:03.309 --> 09:06.085
She's now the property
of the ilaria Corporation.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.026
Let me make this easy for you.

09:09.182 --> 09:12.857
One option, I will allow you to return
to the lab and continue working

09:13.019 --> 09:15.863
even though I've gotten closer
to the cure in eight minutes

09:16.022 --> 09:18.730
than you have in the last
eight days. As for Dr. Walker,

09:19.259 --> 09:22.832
her body contains a proprietary
medical therapy belonging to ilaria.

09:22.996 --> 09:25.738
You can't just appropriate
a human being.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.879
Oh, but I can. She's mine now.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.940
Escort Farragut back to the lab.
Do not let him out of your sight.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.379
And bring me Hatake.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.084
Oh, Sergio, you're bleeding.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.419
How'd you get in here?

09:42.582 --> 09:43.617
How do you think?

09:44.918 --> 09:47.455
Great. You bring him along
to finish the job?

09:47.620 --> 09:50.066
Hey, this wasn't my idea.
I see that.

09:50.223 --> 09:53.227
You don't have your trusty ice ax.
Stop it, both of you.

09:53.393 --> 09:56.636
Kill each other later.
There's other lives at stake here.

09:59.399 --> 10:02.073
Hatake has to have a list
of those kids he stole.

10:02.235 --> 10:03.942
And we need your help to get it.

10:04.104 --> 10:08.143
What you need is to take your brother and
get as far away from this place as you can.

10:08.308 --> 10:10.219
He's right, we're wasting time.

10:10.376 --> 10:12.913
Miksa.
Stop calling me that.

10:13.780 --> 10:17.159
This ends one way
for anyone who stays, understand?

10:17.484 --> 10:20.055
I thought you'd give up the act
and try giving a shit.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.631
Goddamn it.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.424
Don't be naive.
I'm not who you think I am.

10:25.992 --> 10:29.496
You remember that story I told you
about being taken away as a child?

10:29.996 --> 10:34.911
Well, it happened,
only I was the one doing the taking.

10:39.272 --> 10:44.346
I don't believe that.
I am a murderer and a parasite.

10:46.913 --> 10:49.189
Go on, ask your brother,
he knows who I work for.

11:13.106 --> 11:16.883
I already told you,
she is not one of us.

11:17.043 --> 11:19.216
I saw her eyes,
like silver dollars.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.484
What the hell have you done?

11:21.648 --> 11:23.685
Is this the Willis hypothesis again?

11:25.185 --> 11:28.325
I should have known you'd never
give up on that ridiculous notion.

11:28.488 --> 11:31.628
Perhaps she's a naturally
occurring mutation.

11:31.791 --> 11:33.327
Oh, this is no mutation,

11:33.493 --> 11:36.337
no random roll
of the genetic dice.

11:37.030 --> 11:42.480
When I find out what
you've done, and I will find out,

11:43.169 --> 11:45.547
there will be a reckoning.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.082
I wish I could help.

11:48.975 --> 11:51.421
Be careful what you wish for.

11:57.417 --> 12:00.591
You know there is nothing
you can do that I cannot bear.

12:01.654 --> 12:03.600
Oh, these aren't for you.

12:03.756 --> 12:05.030
They're for Julia Walker.

12:16.202 --> 12:17.682
They're taking Jules away

12:18.171 --> 12:21.084
and run their own tests on her
until they find a cure.

12:22.008 --> 12:24.215
Then they won't find anything.

12:25.378 --> 12:27.187
Excuse me?

12:31.251 --> 12:34.061
I did multiple runs
on Julia's blood and tissue samples,

12:34.220 --> 12:37.292
cross-referenced with her
pre-infection blood work. Nothing.

12:37.457 --> 12:38.800
What do you mean, "nothing"?

12:38.958 --> 12:41.962
I mean no immune response,
no antibodies,

12:42.128 --> 12:45.974
no traces of residual
genetic material, no viral DNA.

12:46.232 --> 12:48.940
As far as I can tell,
she's in perfect health.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.109
You'll have to run those tests again.

12:51.704 --> 12:54.048
You mean for a third time?

12:54.641 --> 12:56.917
What you're saying isn't possible.

12:57.076 --> 13:00.649
Right, because nothing else
around here strains credulity.

13:00.813 --> 13:02.087
I'm gonna get Jules back.

13:03.650 --> 13:05.288
Okay.

13:05.451 --> 13:08.398
What can I do?
You didn't even ask me how.

13:08.821 --> 13:11.768
I assumed you already
had that part figured out.

13:13.493 --> 13:14.972
I'll need supplies first.

13:16.596 --> 13:20.806
Potassium chloride,
muriatic acid, ammonium nitrate.

13:20.967 --> 13:25.109
Those are all very unstable.
Explosive, even.

13:25.905 --> 13:27.248
That's what I'm counting on.

14:17.623 --> 14:20.627
So this is how we find ourselves.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.165
After all these years,

14:23.663 --> 14:26.405
everything that we've been through
to achieve our goal,

14:26.566 --> 14:32.642
and you jeopardize all of it
for your own selfish cause.

14:33.473 --> 14:37.512
You've sacrificed everything.
For what?

14:38.811 --> 14:39.983
Ilaria?

14:41.180 --> 14:42.386
I helped build ilaria.

14:43.483 --> 14:44.655
They deserve my loyalty.

14:46.352 --> 14:48.992
Unfortunately, that doesn't seem
to be your strong suit.

14:49.155 --> 14:52.227
I have no problem with loyalty.

14:52.392 --> 14:53.393
Genocide, on the other hand...

14:55.094 --> 14:56.505
- Sutton.
<i>- Dr. Walkerk escaped.</i>

14:56.662 --> 14:57.834
<i>We're searching the area.</i>

14:57.997 --> 15:00.341
Where is she?
<i>She may have gotten into the ducts.</i>

15:00.500 --> 15:03.674
Then go 'mm me duds and find her.
<i>We're gonna need more men.</i>

15:03.836 --> 15:06.783
I don't care how you do it,
just bring her back alive.

15:15.748 --> 15:18.285
She really is special to you,
isn't she?

15:19.085 --> 15:21.087
Are you in love with her?

15:22.355 --> 15:25.427
No, that's too easy.

15:26.626 --> 15:30.096
But you do care for her.
That much is obvious.

15:33.766 --> 15:37.714
What do you see
that I'm not seeing, Hiroshi?

15:38.704 --> 15:42.914
I see a pathetic shell of a woman
I once loved and admired...

15:44.777 --> 15:48.554
who now bows
at the feet of her masters.

15:49.482 --> 15:51.655
Do you have any idea

15:51.818 --> 15:55.960
how much I would like
to cut that smile off your face?

15:58.458 --> 16:00.734
What's stopping you?

17:06.559 --> 17:09.869
I need to go to the supply room.
I need a fermentation flask

17:10.029 --> 17:13.032
and a few bags of 50 percent
dextrose solution.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.542
What the hell for?
It's just dextrose.

17:15.701 --> 17:19.079
Sugar water, like you'd find in an IV bag.
I know what dextrose is.

17:19.672 --> 17:24.087
Okay, so then you know that we need
it to make cell cultures grow, right?

17:24.242 --> 17:27.690
I can't let you out of there. Orders.
Fine.

17:27.847 --> 17:31.761
When Sutton comes asking for results,
you can tell her that we don't have them

17:31.918 --> 17:34.865
because you refused
to give us the right supplies.

17:37.523 --> 17:38.934
I'll get you what you need.

17:40.092 --> 17:41.162
Make me a list.

18:04.083 --> 18:07.553
Then it's settled. There's not one good
reason you can't come back with me.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.131
I just can't.

18:09.288 --> 18:11.734
Why not?

18:11.891 --> 18:14.565
Because of Hatake?
You don't owe him anything.

18:14.727 --> 18:17.537
I'm not running away
from a mess I helped create.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.142
You were just a kid.

18:19.298 --> 18:21.574
This is all you've ever known.

18:21.734 --> 18:23.270
I've made my own choices.

18:23.936 --> 18:27.611
You may not wanna believe this,
but you two are a lot alike.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.582
Dr. Hatake raised me
as one of his own.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.221
Not him.

18:31.377 --> 18:33.482
You and Sergio.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.387
We're nothing alike.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.755
You were both stolen as children,

18:37.917 --> 18:41.455
brought up in a world
built on lies.

18:41.621 --> 18:44.329
I see a person
who's never been at peace,

18:45.758 --> 18:51.572
who doesn't think that
they deserve a home or a family,

18:52.999 --> 18:54.774
or even a second chance.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.115
I'm sorry.

18:58.270 --> 19:00.511
I have to finish this.

19:01.407 --> 19:03.182
Whatever that means.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.521
Don't forget about us, Miksa.

19:13.953 --> 19:15.830
You have a family now.

19:28.701 --> 19:29.873
Here.

19:40.112 --> 19:42.490
Take care of yourself, Anana.

20:36.035 --> 20:38.037
I need more ammonium nitrate.

20:53.419 --> 20:57.094
This is crazy, right? I mean, look at us.
What are we becoming?

20:58.758 --> 21:00.158
What we need to become.

21:02.194 --> 21:06.267
Like the virus, mutating,
changing in order to survive.

21:26.152 --> 21:29.065
- What was that?
- Don't look up.

21:30.156 --> 21:32.067
Julia?

21:34.560 --> 21:36.767
What are you doing up there?

21:40.800 --> 21:42.438
Do they know you've escaped?

21:42.902 --> 21:44.643
I haven't heard any alarms yet.

21:45.237 --> 21:46.580
That might change soon.

21:48.407 --> 21:51.854
Alan, are you under guard?
Yes. We have

21:52.011 --> 21:56.460
two of Ilaria's finest in Observation.

21:56.615 --> 21:59.027
Listen, Jules,
we don't have much time.

21:59.185 --> 22:01.529
I need you to find Hatake
and free him.

22:02.454 --> 22:03.489
Why?

22:04.356 --> 22:08.099
So he can retake the base
when we kill Sutton.

22:11.664 --> 22:14.110
I'll try to get to him.

22:14.266 --> 22:16.644
I know it's impossible,
but please be careful.

22:20.306 --> 22:21.979
You too.

22:28.480 --> 22:31.791
You ready?
Yeah.

22:39.792 --> 22:44.138
Lieutenant Klein, will you tell Sutton
that the cure is ready for a review?

22:58.310 --> 23:00.916
We've been able to separate
the double-binded proteins

23:01.080 --> 23:03.356
and re-encode the RNA.

23:04.516 --> 23:05.551
Have a look.

23:06.685 --> 23:07.720
For what?

23:08.687 --> 23:10.826
Don't you wanna
see the cure in action?

23:10.990 --> 23:15.598
If you look closely, you'll see the viral
load being completely obliterated.

23:15.761 --> 23:18.173
It's groundbreaking, really.

23:50.562 --> 23:52.633
<i>Contamination.</i>

23:54.099 --> 23:56.204
<i>Contamination.</i>

24:04.476 --> 24:06.149
Let's go, move! Go, go, go!

24:09.982 --> 24:11.393
<i>Contamination.</i>

24:16.956 --> 24:18.993
<i>Contamination.</i>

24:20.793 --> 24:22.773
<i>Contamination.</i>

24:24.730 --> 24:26.403
<i>Contamination.</i>

24:26.565 --> 24:28.738
Is she...? ls Sutton...?

24:28.901 --> 24:31.575
I think she took most of the blast

24:31.737 --> 24:34.616
but it was... It was chaotic in there.

24:34.773 --> 24:37.686
You mean you don't
blow people up every day?

24:38.944 --> 24:39.979
Okay, so, what now?

24:41.313 --> 24:44.760
We round up
with Jules and Hatake

24:45.317 --> 24:47.297
and then see who comes out
of the smoke.

24:47.987 --> 24:51.093
<i>- Contamina...</i>
<i>- Dr. Farragut.</i>

24:51.256 --> 24:54.430
<i>Dr. Alan Farragut.</i>

24:54.860 --> 24:57.670
<i>No doubt you're surprised
to be hearing from me.</i>

24:59.164 --> 25:02.202
I can't imagine what
you must be thinking right now.

25:03.102 --> 25:05.810
Let's lay our cards
on the table, shall we?

25:05.971 --> 25:08.178
You are to report to Isolation.

25:08.340 --> 25:12.618
Failure to do so will result in immediate
termination of Peter Farragut.

25:13.312 --> 25:17.624
I expect nothing less
than your full cooperation.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.330
Hold still.

25:20.486 --> 25:22.397
Are you telling me what to do?

25:22.554 --> 25:24.056
You're... You're wounded.

25:24.223 --> 25:25.998
The only thing wounded is my Dior

25:26.158 --> 25:28.798
so unless you are a seamstress,
lieutenant, piss off.

25:37.870 --> 25:40.817
Ain't family a bitch?

25:47.413 --> 25:49.552
No, you can't go.
Look, they will...

25:50.015 --> 25:51.187
They'll kill him.

25:52.051 --> 25:53.428
They're gonna kill him anyway.

25:53.919 --> 25:56.763
The only question is which one
of you she's gonna kill first.

25:58.857 --> 26:01.360
What else can we do?

26:05.264 --> 26:06.766
Wait. Alan,

26:06.932 --> 26:09.208
maybe we can create a diversion.

26:09.935 --> 26:12.279
Do you know what this is?

26:12.438 --> 26:15.009
I don't know what lab we're in.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.748
Otology, the study of sound.

26:18.911 --> 26:21.221
It's an LRAD device.

26:21.380 --> 26:25.089
It's a sound cannon.
Police use them for crowd control.

26:25.851 --> 26:30.095
And I'm pretty sure the mods on this
device allow for high-precision targeting.

26:30.722 --> 26:32.463
You know how to operate
this thing?

26:33.926 --> 26:35.599
A girl's gotta have her hobbies.

26:50.742 --> 26:52.278
Julia,

26:52.444 --> 26:54.219
you shouldn't be here.

26:54.379 --> 26:57.986
If Sutton finds you...
Sutton's got her hands full right now.

27:04.790 --> 27:06.895
Alan needs your help.

27:08.060 --> 27:09.733
Of course.

27:09.895 --> 27:11.272
On one condition.

27:11.430 --> 27:14.172
You stay here in hiding.

27:14.333 --> 27:16.609
I can't do that.
You survived the virus,

27:16.768 --> 27:19.442
and Sutton knows...
Sutton knows what?

27:21.240 --> 27:23.345
You are more important
than anyone else.

27:23.509 --> 27:25.682
Everybody says that.
What's so special about me?

27:26.111 --> 27:27.181
Please, Julia.

27:27.346 --> 27:29.826
I promise to answer
all of your questions

27:29.982 --> 27:33.828
but now is far from the time.

27:42.628 --> 27:46.337
I'm not gonna sit here and hide while
everybody else is risking their lives.

27:46.498 --> 27:47.772
What's happening to me?

27:50.369 --> 27:51.677
I need answers.

27:53.672 --> 27:56.653
You have always been very persistent.

28:12.858 --> 28:15.566
It would be a lot easier
with the keys.

28:17.629 --> 28:19.540
You're not gonna shoot me.

28:19.698 --> 28:23.908
Could be more satisfying knowing you'll
die out there cold, hungry and alone.

28:24.069 --> 28:27.573
I'll survive. I always have.

28:27.739 --> 28:29.514
How'd you get out?

28:33.412 --> 28:36.052
Somebody wasn't paying attention.

28:36.215 --> 28:39.219
You used me.
I told you not to trust me.

28:42.054 --> 28:44.034
Yeah, you're right.

28:48.026 --> 28:49.699
Here.

28:49.861 --> 28:51.738
You're gonna take it anyway, right?

29:17.556 --> 29:18.899
You don't steal from me.

29:19.057 --> 29:22.470
And you never talk about Miksa
that way, you understand me?

29:29.234 --> 29:30.804
Go.

29:31.303 --> 29:32.407
Go! Run away!

29:32.971 --> 29:34.075
Go on.

29:34.239 --> 29:35.479
Freeze! Stop right there!

29:36.908 --> 29:38.148
Shit.

29:39.611 --> 29:42.114
Go. Go.

29:42.648 --> 29:45.254
Are you messing with me?
Shut up and go, right now!

29:45.417 --> 29:47.829
They'll kill you,
but they won't kill me. Just go.

29:53.258 --> 29:54.737
Stop!

29:54.893 --> 29:56.736
Stop her!

29:57.963 --> 29:59.601
Hey, fellas.

29:59.765 --> 30:01.904
Go easy on the wound.
It's a little tender.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.773
<i>Access granted.</i>

30:54.720 --> 30:59.066
- Oh, my God.
- No sudden moves.

31:20.712 --> 31:21.747
Alan.

31:23.081 --> 31:26.153
I gave you every opportunity
to perform up to our standards

31:26.318 --> 31:28.264
but you let me down.

31:28.820 --> 31:30.891
Frankly, I'm disappointed.

31:31.256 --> 31:33.202
You and me both.

31:33.358 --> 31:35.031
Unfortunately
we've reached an impasse.

31:35.227 --> 31:38.936
I don't see how we could possibly
move forward together.

31:39.664 --> 31:42.167
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to let you go.

31:44.603 --> 31:45.775
No. Unh!

31:45.937 --> 31:47.417
Wait until his brother's dead.

31:47.572 --> 31:49.279
Then shoot him.

32:33.385 --> 32:34.420
Come with me.

32:35.487 --> 32:37.160
Now.

32:39.825 --> 32:41.634
Get up.

32:41.793 --> 32:42.965
Let's go, get UP-

32:44.663 --> 32:47.769
What happened back there? The vectors
took Peter up into the ducts.

32:47.933 --> 32:50.470
Don't worry.
They won't harm him.

33:00.345 --> 33:01.847
<i>Access granted.</i>

33:03.181 --> 33:06.094
Dr. Walker. Julia.

33:06.618 --> 33:09.963
- Maybe she's back up in the ducts.
- No, Ilaria has her.

33:19.297 --> 33:21.971
The power grid has been restored.
Someone shorted it out.

33:22.133 --> 33:23.612
Hatake?
No.

33:23.768 --> 33:26.271
The breakers were covered
in that black ooze.

33:26.438 --> 33:28.384
What does it matter?

33:30.041 --> 33:33.853
I've tried to be patient,
but Hiroshi has lost his way.

33:34.012 --> 33:36.322
He's worked outside
the purview for far too long.

33:37.215 --> 33:40.822
We have that cargo you requested.
If you'd like, we can arrange a transfer.

33:40.986 --> 33:43.899
Expedite the transfer.
I want wheels up in 60 minutes.

33:44.055 --> 33:46.160
And what about the Inuit girl?

33:46.324 --> 33:48.668
- What about her?
- She escaped the <i>base,</i>

33:48.827 --> 33:50.363
Balleseros helping her.

33:54.199 --> 33:56.304
I was never under orders
to detain her.

33:56.468 --> 33:59.039
Didn't Hiroshi ever teach you
to take initiative?

33:59.204 --> 34:03.653
Dr. Hatake taught me to protect
the research at all costs.

34:03.808 --> 34:07.017
And right now, that research
is owned by your company.

34:07.812 --> 34:09.052
Just tell me what you need.

34:10.715 --> 34:12.820
Good boy.

34:12.984 --> 34:15.328
Let's leave the heavy lifting
for the next wave.

34:15.487 --> 34:18.400
Let them mop up Hiroshi's mess.

34:28.333 --> 34:30.677
Ilaria is planning
an emergency evac.

34:30.835 --> 34:32.178
I thought you should know.

34:32.337 --> 34:35.216
How do I know you're not
working for them now?

34:35.373 --> 34:40.344
I'm here because the only thing worse
for this base than you is Sutton.

34:41.780 --> 34:43.259
Where's Julia?

34:43.415 --> 34:47.123
Sutton did mention something
about transporting cargo.

34:47.284 --> 34:51.755
If ilaria gets hold of Dr. Walker,
you will never see her again.

34:52.690 --> 34:54.601
Go with him. Find Julia.

34:54.759 --> 34:56.739
What about Sutton?

34:57.929 --> 34:59.306
Leave Sutton to me.

35:02.300 --> 35:05.406
It's not ideal, but it's the
best we could do on short notice.

35:05.570 --> 35:07.777
It'll keep the cargo secure
until we land.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.748
Thank you, Lieutenant Klein.

35:09.908 --> 35:12.115
I can always count on you.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.584
She bit two of my men.

35:16.748 --> 35:19.490
Hopefully the muzzle will take care
of the biting situation.

35:27.726 --> 35:30.400
Love to travel, just hate to pack.

35:33.932 --> 35:36.071
Give me five minutes.

35:43.642 --> 35:45.679
I said I need five...

35:50.448 --> 35:51.756
Hiroshi.

35:52.083 --> 35:53.824
Constance.

35:54.419 --> 35:55.955
Where is Dr. Walker?

35:58.757 --> 36:01.761
You always did have
a weakness for them.

36:01.926 --> 36:04.167
Oh, there were rumors,
of course,

36:05.196 --> 36:08.200
but I never thought you capable
of such a thing.

36:13.304 --> 36:16.012
After all these years,
you still wear the watch I gave you.

36:18.009 --> 36:21.456
The frame is the original. Yes.

36:23.348 --> 36:27.490
I guess once you start replacing parts,
it's never quite the same, is it?

36:28.053 --> 36:29.532
But I'm touched.

36:34.793 --> 36:37.205
We could have changed the world.

36:37.629 --> 36:39.631
Yes.

36:40.799 --> 36:43.837
But who would want to live
in that kind of world?

36:44.002 --> 36:47.176
We took a vow
to author a separate history.

36:47.338 --> 36:51.081
What gives you the right
to turn your back on that, on us?

36:53.878 --> 36:55.755
I was never good enough.

36:55.914 --> 36:58.520
We were never good enough.

36:59.317 --> 37:01.228
I did not mean to hurl you.

37:03.388 --> 37:06.198
Did I turn you away from us?

37:11.763 --> 37:14.403
I tried to make you understand.

37:21.940 --> 37:24.921
You were
the greatest mind among us,

37:25.076 --> 37:29.547
and yet you were willing
to throw it all away. For what?

37:29.948 --> 37:31.256
This abomination?

37:34.385 --> 37:35.455
Was it worth it?

37:35.620 --> 37:38.760
Chasing the Willis hypothesis
to protect your daughter?

37:39.691 --> 37:41.227
I'm sorry.

38:09.654 --> 38:11.600
<i>This is Dr. Hatake.</i>

38:12.223 --> 38:16.262
<i>The ilaria Corporation is no longer
in control of the base.</i>

38:20.498 --> 38:23.570
<i>Constance Sutton has been
removed from authority</i>

38:23.735 --> 38:27.512
<i>and all of her men
have been placed in custody.</i>

38:27.672 --> 38:33.918
<i>From this moment, all base operations
will return to my established protocols.</i>

38:36.181 --> 38:41.028
<i>We will rebuild what has been lost
and return to normalcy.</i>

38:46.090 --> 38:49.094
<i>Until then, please remain calm.</i>

38:49.260 --> 38:55.677
<i>This crisis is in its final stages
and will soon be under control.</i>

39:06.845 --> 39:08.791
No antibodies?

39:10.181 --> 39:12.718
My blood can't be used
to save anyone.

39:12.884 --> 39:15.865
So I live
while everyone around me suffers.

39:23.361 --> 39:25.398
I could hear...

39:25.563 --> 39:27.201
everything-

39:30.001 --> 39:33.744
All of them talking about me
like I'm some kind of thing.

39:42.747 --> 39:45.193
Sutton can't hurt you anymore.

39:45.350 --> 39:47.557
What about the next time?

39:47.719 --> 39:48.891
The next Sutton?

39:54.525 --> 39:56.664
I don't recognize myself anymore.

39:59.097 --> 40:01.907
I'm not the same, Alan.

40:03.701 --> 40:05.840
We all change.

40:07.739 --> 40:10.413
That doesn't mean
we lose who we are.

40:29.928 --> 40:36.607

So cruel to me? ♪</i>

40:36.768 --> 40:42.480
<i>♪ I've been waitin' for a sign ♪♪</i>

40:42.640 --> 40:44.642
What you've done,

40:45.743 --> 40:47.552
I can't ever forgive that.

40:49.247 --> 40:53.059
I have faith that someday
you will understand.

40:53.217 --> 40:55.060
Understand what?

40:56.120 --> 41:00.796
You stole me from my parents,
from my family.

41:00.959 --> 41:02.734
I can't ever get that back.

41:03.328 --> 41:05.308
Daniel.

41:05.463 --> 41:07.670
My name is Miksa.
