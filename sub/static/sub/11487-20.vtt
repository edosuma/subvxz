00:04.840 --> 00:07.957
Hey, what are you doing home
in the middle of the afternoon?

00:08.119 --> 00:10.190
Look outside.

00:13.760 --> 00:16.035
l guess the day got away from me.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.117
-So you still depressed?
-What do you think?

00:21.280 --> 00:22.429
By the looks of things. . .

00:22.600 --> 00:26.798
. . .l'd say you're one sad song away
from deep-throating a shotgun.

00:26.960 --> 00:29.713
Be a pal and put down a tarp first.

00:31.400 --> 00:33.391
How did my life get to this point,
Charlie?

00:33.560 --> 00:35.790
How does how does a man
sink this low?

00:35.960 --> 00:39.316
Well, in all fairness,
you had a running start.

00:41.520 --> 00:43.192
Sorry, sorry. Go on.

00:43.880 --> 00:45.518
Things were going so well.

00:45.680 --> 00:49.389
l had a young, hot girlfriend
who fulfilled all my sexual desires.

00:49.560 --> 00:53.792
-How many desires are we talking about?
-Just the one. You know. . .

00:55.360 --> 00:57.237
. . .for sex.

00:57.920 --> 01:00.115
But now she's gone.

01:00.280 --> 01:03.511
Buddy, she's not really gone.

01:03.680 --> 01:05.352
You know where she is.

01:05.519 --> 01:07.192
Yeah.

01:08.080 --> 01:09.354
And where is that, Alan?

01:10.800 --> 01:12.438
Why are you doing this?

01:13.120 --> 01:16.430
Say it, Alan. The healing begins
when you can say it out loud.

01:18.520 --> 01:22.399
My girlfriend is living with my ex-wife.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.231
You know, l was wrong.

01:25.640 --> 01:28.393
lt's not the healing that begins
when you say it out loud. . .

01:28.560 --> 01:30.357
. . .it's the laughter.

01:31.560 --> 01:33.073
Nice talking to you.

01:33.240 --> 01:34.639
Wait, wait, wait.

01:34.800 --> 01:37.872
Hold on. Don't you wanna hear
how l can help you with all this?

01:38.040 --> 01:41.077
l'm not going back to Tijuana
for another X-rated performance. . .

01:41.240 --> 01:43.390
. . .of The Bride and the Burro.

01:47.840 --> 01:50.673
Okay. First of all,
that's not what l was gonna suggest.

01:51.160 --> 01:54.311
But if you recall, that trip
got you through a particularly dark. . .

01:54.480 --> 01:56.118
. . .depressing part of your divorce.

01:56.280 --> 01:59.750
The first time you smiled in months
was when you caught the bouquet.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.717
All right,
against my better judgment. . .

02:01.880 --> 02:04.440
. . .l'm gonna go and ask.
How do you propose to help me?

02:04.600 --> 02:08.195
Well, first let's make sure
that we agree on the problem.

02:08.440 --> 02:11.033
-Your ex-wife befriended your girlfriend.
-Yes.

02:11.640 --> 02:14.632
And your girlfriend has moved in
with your ex-wife.

02:14.800 --> 02:15.789
Yes.

02:15.960 --> 02:18.428
Your ex-wife is turning
your girlfriend against you.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.033
Do we have to go through this?

02:20.200 --> 02:22.998
Just until it stops being funny.

02:25.640 --> 02:29.030
Anyway, it would seem to me
the simple solution is to find someone. . .

02:29.200 --> 02:31.760
. . .to speak to Kandi on your behalf.
Someone she trusts.

02:31.920 --> 02:34.195
Yes, that would be great.
Now, what's your point?

02:34.360 --> 02:35.759
Charlie?

02:37.240 --> 02:38.514
lf you're not coming back. . .

02:38.680 --> 02:41.831
. . .at least tell me
where you keep the fresh batteries.

02:42.480 --> 02:44.357
l'll be right up.

02:44.720 --> 02:46.551
And it's rechargeable.

02:48.920 --> 02:52.515
My point is,
l'm banging Kandi's mom.

02:53.480 --> 02:54.549
What?

02:56.120 --> 02:58.111
You're welcome.

03:00.000 --> 03:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:32.480 --> 03:34.072
Who is it?

03:34.240 --> 03:35.958
You know damn well who it is.

03:36.120 --> 03:38.429
l'm entertaining.

03:38.600 --> 03:41.831
Not as much as you seem to think.

03:42.280 --> 03:43.508
Hang on.

03:43.680 --> 03:46.353
No, not you. You let go.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.633
Come on in, Alan.

03:48.800 --> 03:52.236
-Are you decent?
-He's above average.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.436
Just come in.

03:59.320 --> 04:00.799
Come on.

04:00.960 --> 04:04.873
Oh, he's cute.
l can see why Kandi likes him.

04:05.040 --> 04:06.234
Used to like him.

04:06.400 --> 04:11.190
Oh yeah, l'm so sorry about that.
Come, sit. Let's talk about it.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.392
Are you sure l'm not interrupting?

04:13.560 --> 04:14.879
Don't worry about it.

04:15.040 --> 04:17.394
Kind of hit
the seventh-inning stretch anyway.

04:18.120 --> 04:19.678
You can go two more innings?

04:19.839 --> 04:22.877
Even if l have to start throwing
knuckle balls.

04:23.560 --> 04:24.549
Sit down.

04:25.200 --> 04:26.633
Okay.

04:28.200 --> 04:31.237
So you're Kandi's mom, huh?

04:31.680 --> 04:33.398
-Mandi.
-Alan.

04:33.560 --> 04:34.629
Some grip, huh?

04:38.200 --> 04:40.873
Well, Mandi, l can see where--

04:41.040 --> 04:43.270
Where your daughter
gets her good looks from.

04:43.440 --> 04:46.159
Thank you. You know,
a lot of people think we're sisters.

04:46.320 --> 04:49.676
Oh, there's a mental picture that'll get
me through the last two innings.

04:49.840 --> 04:52.308
-Don't be naughty.
-Why, are you gonna spank me?

04:52.480 --> 04:54.789
-l just might.
-l just might let you.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.638
l just might go hang myself.

04:58.760 --> 05:00.239
Oh, relax.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.197
Oh, Kandi said he was a little shy.

05:02.360 --> 05:04.920
First time they had sex,
he didn't take his shirt off.

05:05.080 --> 05:06.877
Excuse me, that wasn't shyness.

05:07.040 --> 05:10.316
The first time l had sex with your
daughter, l barely got my pants off.

05:10.480 --> 05:15.235
Whoa, whoa, whoa, boundaries.
This is Kandi's mom.

05:15.400 --> 05:19.598
Oh, l'm sorry. l didn't mean
to create an awkward moment.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.476
But enough about me.

05:24.720 --> 05:27.439
How is it that you two are. . . .

05:28.080 --> 05:29.433
l mean, you know. . .

05:29.600 --> 05:31.875
. . .how did you exactly--?

05:32.680 --> 05:34.557
What the hell is going on here?

05:35.040 --> 05:37.793
Good question, and a great story.

05:37.960 --> 05:40.428
Mandi showed up here
looking for Kandi.

05:42.040 --> 05:43.678
That's not a great story.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.073
Sure it is. lt's already had like
half a dozen happy endings.

05:48.520 --> 05:50.909
You are definitely going over my knee.

05:51.080 --> 05:52.752
Alan, we gotta wrap it up here.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.911
But you said
you'd help me with Kandi.

05:55.080 --> 05:56.479
l didn't say now.

05:56.640 --> 05:59.518
-Do you want me to talk to her?
-l would really appreciate it.

05:59.680 --> 06:03.355
Excuse me, but the pitcher's all
warmed up and ready to take the mound.

06:04.280 --> 06:06.840
Of course,
l'm kind of busy at the moment.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.718
Got it.

06:13.560 --> 06:16.199
Oh, charge!

06:23.480 --> 06:25.914
-Hey, Dad. Mom, Dad's here.
-Hey.

06:26.080 --> 06:28.674
No, don't, don't bother your mom.
ls Kandi around?

06:28.840 --> 06:31.274
-Yeah, she lives here now.
-l know.

06:31.440 --> 06:33.874
Does this mean she and Mom are gay?

06:35.640 --> 06:38.108
-No, it does not.
-Too bad.

06:39.560 --> 06:42.916
-Why?
-Be a lot easier to explain.

06:44.080 --> 06:48.710
-Could you just tell Kandi l'm here?
-Okay. Kandi, my dad's here.

06:50.040 --> 06:52.395
-What do you want, Alan?
-l wanna talk to Kandi.

06:52.560 --> 06:54.516
-l don't think that's a good idea.
-Why?

06:54.680 --> 06:57.831
She's a sweet, innocent girl.
l don't want you to ruin her life too.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.197
-Too? How did l ruin your life?
-You stole my youth.

07:01.360 --> 07:02.634
You took my house.

07:04.400 --> 07:06.789
That seems like a fair trade.

07:07.160 --> 07:10.072
Face it. This escapade with Kandi
is just a pathetic attempt. . .

07:10.240 --> 07:12.515
. . .to find a younger version of me.

07:13.400 --> 07:16.073
Are you kidding?
Judith, l had a younger version of you. . .

07:16.240 --> 07:18.595
. . .and let me tell you,
it was no great shakes.

07:19.960 --> 07:22.155
lt's okay, Judith. l'll talk to him.

07:22.320 --> 07:25.995
He doesn't want to talk to you. There's
only one thing a man is interested in.

07:26.360 --> 07:27.793
What?

07:28.720 --> 07:30.517
Forget it. l'm here if you need me.

07:33.280 --> 07:34.508
Hello, Alan.

07:35.480 --> 07:38.278
Listen, Kandi,
l'm really sorry about our fight.

07:38.440 --> 07:41.432
l know l can be a little bit
of a control freak and--

07:41.600 --> 07:44.433
But l honestly care for you. . .

07:44.600 --> 07:46.591
. . .and l hope you'll give me
another chance.

07:46.760 --> 07:49.149
l see. Excuse me.

07:55.160 --> 07:57.355
l can't let you steal my youth.

07:59.400 --> 08:01.789
You're not fooling anybody, Judith.

08:01.960 --> 08:03.916
Come on, Kandi,
tell me what you think.

08:04.080 --> 08:08.517
Okay. l think we've reached
an implants in our relationship.

08:09.600 --> 08:10.635
lmpasse.

08:11.800 --> 08:15.839
l think we've reached an impasse
in our relationship. Goodbye.

08:22.880 --> 08:24.757
Excuse me,
is this Judith Harper's house?

08:24.920 --> 08:27.070
Yeah. She traded it for her youth.

08:33.120 --> 08:35.475
-Hi, Daddy.
-Hi, sweetheart.

08:37.280 --> 08:39.316
Come on in.
Judith can't wait to meet you.

08:39.480 --> 08:40.707
l can't wait to meet her.

08:40.880 --> 08:44.190
l know you two
are gonna love each other.

08:45.760 --> 08:47.398
l watch one donkey sex show. . .

08:47.560 --> 08:50.438
. . .and you make me pay for it
the rest of my life.

08:56.920 --> 08:58.478
Who is it?

08:59.240 --> 09:01.674
Don't screw with me, Charlie.
We need to talk.

09:01.840 --> 09:03.353
Give me a sec.

09:03.520 --> 09:06.114
Charlie, you're just making it tighter.

09:06.280 --> 09:09.272
Oh, the hell with it. Come on in, Alan.

09:13.160 --> 09:15.151
-Hey there.
-Hiya.

09:16.960 --> 09:20.919
-You know, l can come back.
-lt's okay, Alan. Come, sit.

09:22.080 --> 09:23.672
All right.

09:26.240 --> 09:29.152
So how did it go with Kandi?

09:29.680 --> 09:30.669
lf it had gone well. . .

09:30.840 --> 09:34.071
. . .do you think l'd be sitting here
talking to two half-naked people?

09:34.240 --> 09:35.673
-Alan?
-What?

09:35.840 --> 09:37.592
l'm completely naked.

09:39.920 --> 09:40.989
What happened, Alan?

09:42.000 --> 09:45.515
Well, as l suspected, Judith has turned
your daughter against me.

09:45.680 --> 09:49.070
Well, l'm not surprised.
Kandi's always been very suggestible.

09:49.240 --> 09:52.710
You know, until she was 8
she thought this was her nose.

09:52.880 --> 09:53.915
That's kind of cute.

09:54.080 --> 09:57.789
When Alan was 8, l convinced him
he only had two weeks to live.

09:57.960 --> 10:01.191
But l suppose that tells you more
about me than him.

10:01.680 --> 10:04.399
Yeah, good times.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.749
But back to recent events--

10:09.240 --> 10:13.279
Remember when l told you the cat-litter
box was filled with Almond Roca?

10:13.440 --> 10:15.158
He ate four of them.

10:16.560 --> 10:19.916
Are we done visiting Charlie Harper's
Museum of Sibling Cruelty?

10:21.480 --> 10:23.038
l have something to talk about.

10:23.200 --> 10:26.909
Oh, l'm sorry.
l didn't realize l was interrupting you.

10:27.920 --> 10:28.989
Go ahead, Alan.

10:29.160 --> 10:30.149
Thank you.

10:30.320 --> 10:32.231
So as l was leaving
my ex-wife's house. . .

10:32.400 --> 10:34.118
. . .l ran into your ex-husband.

10:34.280 --> 10:35.679
-Andy?
-l guess.

10:35.840 --> 10:39.389
Wait a second.
lt's Mandi, Andy and Kandi?

10:40.160 --> 10:41.752
What's your point?

10:42.480 --> 10:44.118
No point.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.991
Mandi, Andy, Kandi.

10:47.440 --> 10:48.555
Dandy.

10:50.560 --> 10:55.554
Anyway, it appears as if Kandi has set
my ex-wife up on a blind date with him.

10:56.040 --> 10:57.234
How nice.

10:57.400 --> 10:58.799
Nice? How is that nice?

10:58.960 --> 11:01.349
Well, he's been kind of depressed
since we broke up.

11:01.520 --> 11:03.715
lt's good to see
he's getting back on the horse.

11:04.040 --> 11:06.634
But that horse is my ex-wife.

11:06.800 --> 11:10.156
Speaking of which, did you ever see
The Bride and the Burro in Tijuana?

11:10.560 --> 11:12.994
See it? l caught the bouquet.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.552
So did Alan.

11:17.720 --> 11:20.075
Always a bridesmaid, never a burro.

11:21.600 --> 11:24.273
Charlie,
l'm starting to lose feeling in my arm.

11:24.440 --> 11:25.759
Oh, l'm sorry.

11:25.920 --> 11:28.912
Hey, you went pretty far in the scouts.
Can you undo this knot?

11:29.080 --> 11:31.389
Gee, actually,
l specialized in lndian lore.

11:31.560 --> 11:34.597
Beaded belts, arrowheads.
But, good luck though.

11:35.480 --> 11:37.436
Maybe you should go get
a pair of scissors.

11:37.600 --> 11:40.512
Hang on, let me untie my feet.

11:43.320 --> 11:46.073
We really didn't think this through,
did we?

11:49.960 --> 11:53.635
So has your mom
been seeing a lot of Kandi's dad?

11:54.560 --> 11:58.997
That's right. lf she married him,
Kandi would be your stepsister.

11:59.800 --> 12:03.349
Hey, hey, hey, do you happen to know
if they're going out tonight?

12:04.160 --> 12:07.152
Yep, if l married Kandi,
she would be your stepmother.

12:07.320 --> 12:08.673
But--

12:08.840 --> 12:11.912
But tonight--
ls your mom going out tonight?

12:12.880 --> 12:17.032
Yeah, yeah, l get it. lf Kandi
took a poop, it would be your step-stool.

12:27.240 --> 12:29.231
All right, well. . .

12:29.520 --> 12:31.875
. . .it's always good to talk to you.

12:32.720 --> 12:34.551
Love you, buddy.

12:35.720 --> 12:36.994
Did you get all that, Berta?

12:37.880 --> 12:40.553
l think so, but let's do a quick recap.

12:40.720 --> 12:42.756
Your girlfriend's
living with your ex-wife.

12:42.920 --> 12:45.388
Your ex-wife's
dating your girlfriend's father.

12:45.560 --> 12:48.233
To top it off,
you're trying to get useful intelligence. . .

12:48.400 --> 12:50.868
. . .from a kid who's got
precious little to spare.

12:51.640 --> 12:52.993
Okay, just checking.

12:53.560 --> 12:54.549
Hey, Berta.

12:55.320 --> 12:57.629
-l want you to meet Mandi. Mandi, Berta.
-Hi.

13:00.120 --> 13:01.633
Listen. . .

13:01.800 --> 13:03.711
. . .we got a pair of scissors handy?

13:03.880 --> 13:06.189
Oh, Charlie, that's a silk tie.

13:06.360 --> 13:08.669
Why didn't you use
one of the poly blends?

13:08.840 --> 13:12.276
Hey, hey, wait a minute, that's my tie.
You ruined my tie.

13:12.640 --> 13:13.993
Oh, yeah.

13:14.160 --> 13:17.675
You're not gonna be happy
about your electric toothbrush either.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.274
Kandi's told me
so many nice things about you.

13:22.440 --> 13:23.589
How do you know Kandi?

13:23.760 --> 13:25.876
-She's my daughter.
-Your daughter?

13:26.040 --> 13:27.519
Sweet whistling Geronimo.

13:27.680 --> 13:31.673
You people are like a box of hamsters,
just crawling all over each other.

13:33.200 --> 13:34.315
Yes, yes.

13:35.280 --> 13:38.192
-We all get how this looks, Berta.
-Hey, l'm not knocking it.

13:38.360 --> 13:41.875
l'm just wondering when some of that
gravy's gonna spill over on my taters.

13:51.400 --> 13:52.389
Hey, what's up?

13:54.200 --> 13:56.111
What's up? What are you doing here?

13:56.280 --> 13:58.748
Well, Mandi came over
to put in a good word for you. . .

13:58.920 --> 14:01.559
. . .and l figured l'd tag along for grins.

14:02.480 --> 14:04.471
Here comes one now.

14:06.760 --> 14:08.352
Come on in.

14:09.200 --> 14:12.397
l'm in a nightmare
and l can't wake up.

14:13.560 --> 14:15.391
Sit down. Make yourself at home.

14:19.040 --> 14:20.268
Thanks. . .

14:20.440 --> 14:21.589
. . .l will.

14:21.920 --> 14:25.071
-Where's-- Where's Jake?
-He's at a sleepover.

14:25.760 --> 14:27.398
Hi, Alan.

14:27.560 --> 14:28.754
How are you?

14:28.920 --> 14:31.639
About two heartbeats
from a brain aneurysm.

14:32.920 --> 14:33.909
Where's Kandi?

14:34.080 --> 14:36.640
She's in her room.
But l thought we should talk first.

14:38.720 --> 14:41.359
We just have a few questions.

14:41.680 --> 14:42.669
About what?

14:43.520 --> 14:44.953
Charlie?

14:45.120 --> 14:49.159
Well, Kandi's mom and l are
a little concerned about your intentions.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.392
You should be. . .

14:54.560 --> 14:56.152
. . .because l intend to kill you.

15:00.240 --> 15:01.639
That's the kind of attitude. . .

15:01.800 --> 15:05.076
. . .that isn't gonna win you
a lot of friends around here, mister.

15:05.880 --> 15:07.871
Alan, you're a very sweet man.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.314
But let's face facts.

15:09.480 --> 15:12.313
Kandi has her whole life ahead of her,
while you. . .

15:12.480 --> 15:14.436
. . .not so much.

15:15.720 --> 15:18.109
-Kandi?
-Alan?

15:18.280 --> 15:20.669
-l am so sorry.
-No, l'm sorry.

15:22.520 --> 15:24.272
Oh, isn't that sweet?

15:25.560 --> 15:28.154
-l missed you so much.
-l missed you too, huggy bear.

15:28.520 --> 15:31.353
Mom, l'm gonna go have sex with Alan,
okay?

15:31.520 --> 15:33.397
You kids have fun.

15:35.320 --> 15:38.118
-Hold on there, young man.
-What?

15:38.280 --> 15:41.556
Don't be a selfish lover.
Consider her needs.

15:42.920 --> 15:44.751
This isn't over.

15:49.200 --> 15:52.829
You're right.
He is easy to screw with.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.232
Hey, four pieces of Almond Roca.
Even the cat was laughing at him.

15:58.600 --> 16:00.591
So should we head back to my place?

16:01.520 --> 16:02.748
l suppose.

16:03.160 --> 16:04.275
What's wrong?

16:04.440 --> 16:06.351
Nothing. lt's just. . .

16:06.520 --> 16:08.351
. . .we've already had sex there.

16:08.520 --> 16:11.876
Oh, baby. l really, really like you.

16:12.720 --> 16:15.075
Well, thank you, Judith.
l had a wonderful evening.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.708
l hope we can do it again some--

16:23.840 --> 16:26.400
Maybe catch a movie.

16:27.360 --> 16:29.555
Or go for a hike.

16:31.800 --> 16:34.268
l'm guessing that's your ex-husband.

16:34.440 --> 16:36.670
-Good-looking man.
-Oh, he's gorgeous.

16:36.840 --> 16:38.034
Dumb as wood.

16:38.200 --> 16:39.428
Oh, my Lord.

16:39.840 --> 16:42.115
But it's good wood.

16:43.920 --> 16:48.198
-l better find Alan so we can get out.
-You wanna leave? This is so hot.

16:48.360 --> 16:52.114
Oh, Mandi, you just keep getting better
and better.

16:52.280 --> 16:56.717
-Hang on while l give Alan a heads up.
-Hurry back and give me one.

17:05.440 --> 17:07.112
Alan?

17:11.880 --> 17:13.393
Alan?

17:13.560 --> 17:16.313
You're the most beautiful man
l've ever seen.

17:16.480 --> 17:18.198
Not Alan.

17:20.160 --> 17:21.912
Couldn't find him.

17:23.319 --> 17:24.752
Mandi.

17:25.119 --> 17:26.439
Mandi.

17:26.599 --> 17:28.318
You know what else l like?
Swap meets.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.311
-Swell.
-Yeah.

17:30.480 --> 17:33.153
Your ex-husband
must be a real little guy, huh?

17:33.320 --> 17:36.312
Forget about him.
Let's get some wine in you.

17:42.120 --> 17:44.031
Mandi.

17:44.400 --> 17:46.436
Glasses are in there.

17:48.680 --> 17:50.193
No, no, top shelf.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.595
That's what l'm talking about.

18:01.120 --> 18:05.238
Hey, you ever go rock climbing?
lt's a great workout.

18:09.200 --> 18:10.997
Mandi?

18:15.480 --> 18:16.993
Mandi.

18:18.320 --> 18:19.912
Alan?

18:20.400 --> 18:22.277
-Anybody?
-Over here.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.199
Damn it.

18:31.560 --> 18:34.677
-What are you doing?
-l was thirsty.

18:35.200 --> 18:38.749
-Have you seen Alan?
-l've been in the closet.

18:39.200 --> 18:40.713
So where the hell is he?

18:40.880 --> 18:42.836
Oh, my, l'm sorry l'm so nervous.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.230
l haven't been with another woman
in a long time.

18:45.400 --> 18:48.119
Yeah, yeah, take off your robe.

18:48.280 --> 18:49.679
Okay.

18:50.120 --> 18:52.429
Hot damn.

18:52.960 --> 18:56.032

19:03.800 --> 19:06.314
-Hi, Daddy.
-Hey, Judith.

19:08.520 --> 19:10.750
Daddy,
l want you to meet my boyfriend, Alan.

19:11.320 --> 19:14.278
-Nice to see you again.
-Small world.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.390
-l said l was sorry.
-Just get out.

19:25.040 --> 19:28.191
l'll give you a call, Judith.
Maybe we'll hit some garage sales.

19:28.360 --> 19:30.112
Yeah, terrific.

19:34.760 --> 19:36.239
l like your daughter.

19:36.960 --> 19:38.916
l like your ex-wife.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.349
Wanna get a drink?

19:43.080 --> 19:44.513
l'm not doing anything.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.915
Do you like garage sales?

19:50.080 --> 19:52.116
Where am l supposed to go?

19:52.280 --> 19:54.635
l don't care. Just leave.

19:54.800 --> 19:56.597
But l thought we were friends.

19:56.760 --> 20:00.753
Friends don't have sex with their friends'
ex-husbands in the first friend's hot tub.

20:04.880 --> 20:07.838
Divorced three years
and he's still ruining my life.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.992
Should have drowned his stupid ass.

20:14.200 --> 20:16.555
-Did you hear something?
-Nope.

20:16.720 --> 20:18.950
-How's the head?
-Let's find out.
