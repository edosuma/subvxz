Hmm.
This spot should be safe.

Amethyst, do you have the robonoid?!

Yeah.
Don't worry about it.

Amethyst!
I just repaired that!

Yeah, yeah.
It's fine.

00:40.088 --> 00:41.289
Ugh! Okay.

00:46.662 --> 00:48.629
- Hey, guys!
- Steven!

00:48.730 --> 00:51.832
It's way past your bedtime!
You should really go

00:51.917 --> 00:53.668
- back to the house.
- What?

00:53.752 --> 00:56.754
I don't want to miss...
whatever this is.

00:56.838 --> 00:59.006
- What is this?
- Pearl got lonely,

00:59.141 --> 01:01.008
so she made herself a robot friend.

01:01.059 --> 01:03.844
It's not a robot friend ...
it's a robot disruptor!

01:03.929 --> 01:06.097
It should produce a localized

01:06.181 --> 01:09.100
energy blast.
So when Peridot shows up to...

01:09.184 --> 01:12.653
neet with us, we'll have
something that can knock out

01:12.688 --> 01:16.607
all her robonoids.
Now, stand back, everyone!

01:30.182 --> 01:32.282
We did it!

01:33.342 --> 01:35.960
Well, you knocked out

01:36.044 --> 01:38.713
- all the lights in town.
- Steven, that was not

01:38.764 --> 01:42.216
the point of the ...
All right. That was a start!

01:42.301 --> 01:44.594
Now I'm going to need
to take some parts out of

01:44.595 --> 01:46.887
the washing machine. Steven,
you might have to wear

01:46.972 --> 01:50.141
- the same shirt for a while.
- No problem.

01:53.721 --> 01:55.630
Hmm.

01:59.701 --> 02:01.702
Hmph.

02:01.770 --> 02:04.972
What's wrong with
the microwav... Ow!

02:05.040 --> 02:07.875
What is the meaning of this?!

02:07.943 --> 02:10.945
Huh?

02:11.013 --> 02:14.248
- Mayor Dewey?
- Hello, there, young Universe.

02:14.333 --> 02:17.885
- Any of your... sisters home?
- My sisters?

02:17.919 --> 02:20.755
Your caretakers, you know ...
the tall one, the purple one,

02:20.839 --> 02:22.090
the hot one?

02:22.261 --> 02:24.762
Look, the power's out, and I've been

02:24.846 --> 02:28.098
mayor long enough to know
they had something to do with it.

02:28.150 --> 02:30.484
My sisters?

02:30.602 --> 02:33.854
Is there anyone else I can
talk to about this?

02:33.939 --> 02:36.857
- Pearl!
- Coming!

02:36.942 --> 02:39.944
- Oh! Uh, can I help you?
- Yes.

02:39.995 --> 02:42.780
Oh, hi!
Uh, Beach City is currently

02:42.831 --> 02:44.915
experiencing a widespread power outage.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.500
Oh, don't worry about that.

02:46.618 --> 02:49.119
The power should be back
on as early as tonight or

02:49.204 --> 02:52.456
- as late as... never.
- Never coming back?!

02:52.541 --> 02:55.376
- Yes?
- No, no, no!

02:55.460 --> 02:58.179
It has to come back!
The people of Beach City can't

02:58.263 --> 03:01.432
handle a situation like this!
They need their electronic

03:01.466 --> 03:04.768
distractions so they won't
notice that this town

03:04.853 --> 03:07.855
- is a magnet for disaster!
- Oh, don't be dramatic.

03:07.973 --> 03:10.858
I saw humans get on fine
without power for millennia.

03:10.942 --> 03:13.027
You used to hunt and gather.

03:13.111 --> 03:14.478
What happened to that?

03:14.563 --> 03:17.481
You don't understand.
Sure, things seem calm now, in

03:17.532 --> 03:22.152
the light of the day, but when
the sun goes down, so does...

03:22.237 --> 03:25.072
- the town.
- He's right.

03:25.156 --> 03:27.908
Mayor Dewey, this is our responsibility.

03:27.993 --> 03:30.294
We'll help you clean up this mess!

03:30.378 --> 03:31.770
<i>No, we won't!</i>

03:31.771 --> 03:34.915
- I'll help you clean up this mess!
- Okay.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.501

Hello, youth resident of Beach City.

03:50.348 --> 03:53.517

- You mean besides the power

03:53.568 --> 03:56.854
knocking out the freezers
and melting

03:56.905 --> 03:59.773
- all this ice cream!
- What?! Ice cream?!

03:59.858 --> 04:02.860
It's a real pain in the ...
Ugh!

04:02.911 --> 04:05.229
I'd offer you some,
but it's pretty soupy.

04:05.297 --> 04:08.198
Is this happening to
ice cream all over town?!

04:08.266 --> 04:11.769
- This really is a crisis!
- Now let's all calm down here.

04:11.836 --> 04:14.939
- I have everything under control.
- You do?

04:15.006 --> 04:17.435
Of course!
The power will be back,

04:17.533 --> 04:20.177
and the freezers will
be working by sundown.

04:20.245 --> 04:22.746
No need to cry over, uh, frozen milk.

04:22.814 --> 04:25.716
Here.
I'll catch you kids on the side

04:25.817 --> 04:27.785

You take care now.

04:27.982 --> 04:31.118
- See you later!
- Thanks for the glowstick!

04:31.219 --> 04:33.954
So, everything is
going to be okay?!

04:34.022 --> 04:37.357
- What? No!
- Y-You lied to them?

04:37.442 --> 04:41.995
Look, Steven, it's not lying
when you're the mayor.

04:42.030 --> 04:44.364
- It's politics.
- It is?

04:44.416 --> 04:47.117
Of course it is.
Let me tell you something.

04:47.202 --> 04:50.087
When you work for the
government, you can't control

04:50.205 --> 04:52.898
what happens in the
world, but you can control

04:52.899 --> 04:56.561
how people feel about it.
That's the real weight I carry ...

04:56.596 --> 04:59.930
making the good people
of Beach City feel better,

05:00.048 --> 05:02.466
- safer, more secure.
- But ...

05:02.550 --> 05:05.469
What's my other option ...
let the people panic and riot?

05:05.553 --> 05:07.888
That didn't work out so well
for Ocean Town!

05:07.972 --> 05:09.890
I've never heard of Ocean Town.

05:09.941 --> 05:12.142
Exactly!
That's why you've got to give

05:12.227 --> 05:14.228
the people something to believe in.

05:14.312 --> 05:17.865
When they see my giant head
on this car, rolling down

05:17.899 --> 05:20.317
<i>the boardwalk, they think,
"here comes help."</i>

05:20.401 --> 05:23.237
Well, some people think, "here
comes that exterminator guy,"

05:23.371 --> 05:26.073
but then they realize it's me,
their mayor!

05:26.157 --> 05:29.376
Have you seen that exterminator
truck with the head on it?

05:29.410 --> 05:31.578
- He's totally copying me.
- Uh...

05:31.629 --> 05:34.882
- Here. Take these.

temporary one, not a big

Things could be worse!

05:56.488 --> 05:59.723
We could be in... Ocean Town!

05:59.791 --> 06:01.992
- Too soon!
- Anyway, the power will be

06:02.060 --> 06:04.962
back on by sundown, so, in the
meantime, just enjoy this

06:05.030 --> 06:06.681
beautiful, peaceful day outside.

06:06.682 --> 06:09.933

<i>- Ohh!
- I trust this man!</i>

06:12.337 --> 06:14.972

Make sure everyone gets

06:15.056 --> 06:16.857
a button and a glowstick.

06:17.175 --> 06:19.176
Have a glowstick.
Here you go.

06:19.244 --> 06:22.229
- Uh, here.
- Hey, Schtu-ball.

06:22.313 --> 06:25.149
You get some sort of secret
government internship

06:25.233 --> 06:28.068
- I need to know about?
- Here.

06:28.153 --> 06:30.047
Apparently, you can never
have too many

06:30.082 --> 06:32.122
Mayor Dewey buttons.
Sounds like I'm not gonna be

06:32.157 --> 06:35.075
needing this glowstick, though.
See you later, buddy!

06:35.160 --> 06:36.694
But, Dad!

06:37.366 --> 06:39.763
<i>Nooooo.</i>

06:43.902 --> 06:46.136
<i>So what if she
shows up with more?</i>

06:46.204 --> 06:48.839
<i>- I say we just mash 'em all!
- It's not just</i>

06:48.923 --> 06:50.891
<i>the robonoids.

- Who knows what she's</i>

<i>going to have?
We won't stand a chance against</i>

06:55.914 --> 06:58.982
<i>their weapons, but if we can
just knock them out ...</i>

06:59.084 --> 07:01.118
<i>It's not about the
robonoids, Pearl.</i>

07:01.186 --> 07:03.454
<i>- She's coming with other gems!
- Says who?!</i>

07:03.521 --> 07:05.289
<i>Who cares?!
What does Lapis even know?!</i>

07:05.356 --> 07:10.949
<i>- Calm down, Amethyst.
- You calm down-uh... Hey!</i>

It's Steven!

What are you doing here, buddy?

07:18.920 --> 07:23.123
I... live here.
Is everything okay?

07:23.191 --> 07:27.194
- Of... course!
- In fact, we were just

07:27.295 --> 07:30.264
- about to play... cards.
- Yes, cards!

07:30.331 --> 07:33.533
Want to play war?

07:33.618 --> 07:37.170
- I mean... peace?
- Yeah, but how are we

07:37.205 --> 07:39.957
- gonna play cards in the dark?
- We can light a fire

07:40.041 --> 07:43.176
- in the fireplace.
- Yes! Like early man!

07:43.211 --> 07:46.179
Come on, early man!

07:56.307 --> 07:59.977
<i>When the sun goes down, so does...</i>

08:00.061 --> 08:01.111

- Oh, my gosh!
- How come there's still no power?!

08:14.275 --> 08:18.312
You said it would be on by sundown!

08:18.379 --> 08:21.281
Everyone just calm down.
I'm sure if we just talk

08:21.349 --> 08:23.850
rationally, we can come to an agreement.

08:23.918 --> 08:26.386
No agreement!
You promised us!

08:26.454 --> 08:29.089
Without power, I can't take
care of my family!

08:29.157 --> 08:32.275
Well, this one's fine.
But he can't take care of himself!

08:32.510 --> 08:34.760
I'm sure the power will be on

08:34.828 --> 08:39.732
- tomorrow, I think... maybe.
- Stop pulling our legs!

08:39.799 --> 08:42.235
You lied to us, and you're lying again!

08:42.303 --> 08:44.404

08:44.472 --> 08:47.307
Good citizens of Beach City ...
Ow!

08:47.358 --> 08:48.642
<i>- Liar!

08:50.436 --> 08:54.481

08:54.532 --> 08:56.183
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

09:03.457 --> 09:07.210
Everyone, please!

09:09.355 --> 09:13.750
The power might not be back on tonight.
It might not be back on

09:13.834 --> 09:15.168
- for even a year!
- A year?

09:15.403 --> 09:17.320
- What?
- But I know that wou're

09:17.405 --> 09:20.323
all going to be okay
because I know each and every

09:20.374 --> 09:22.559
one of you. You're smart
and you're tough and you're

09:22.660 --> 09:25.795
resourceful, and you
all care about each other more

09:25.863 --> 09:29.199
than you care about microwave
dinners or video games or being

09:29.266 --> 09:31.801

I know it'll hurt your

09:31.836 --> 09:34.838
businesses.
I know it'll hurt your lives.

09:34.922 --> 09:37.390
But are we really going
to hurt each other?

09:37.475 --> 09:39.476
Of course not!

09:39.510 --> 09:43.513
We'll face the night together,
and we'll survive, because we

09:43.647 --> 09:46.516
- are the light of Beach City!
- Yeah!

09:46.567 --> 09:48.351
- Whoo-hoo!
- Uh, yes.

09:48.402 --> 09:51.488
Thank you, Steven!
I couldn't have said it better!

09:51.555 --> 09:53.723
Don't try to worm your way
out of this!

09:53.791 --> 09:55.992
- Oh, no, no!
- It's okay! It's okay!

09:56.026 --> 09:58.862
Mayor Dewey was hiding things
from you, but he did it because

09:58.946 --> 10:02.615
he didn't want you to worry.
He was just sheltering you from

10:02.700 --> 10:05.585
the truth because he ...
he loves you.

10:09.256 --> 10:10.673

10:12.343 --> 10:15.578
Oh, hey, Steven.
If I can just concentrate

10:15.646 --> 10:17.814
- the wave a little more...
- Um... do you guys want to talk?

10:17.915 --> 10:21.017
And why would we need

10:21.085 --> 10:22.969
- to do that?
- Hey, Steven, you still

10:23.053 --> 10:25.955
- owe us a game of cards!
- Yeah, get in on this.

10:26.023 --> 10:29.025
N-No!
I don't want to play cards!

10:29.059 --> 10:32.228
- I want to talk about Peridot!
- Oh, yes!

10:32.313 --> 10:34.864
- Well, everything is fine!
- No, it's not!

10:34.932 --> 10:37.967
I know it's not.
I know you ... you just don't

10:38.035 --> 10:42.238
want me to be scared, but
just tell me the truth.

10:42.339 --> 10:46.376
Peridot is coming,
and we don't know who or what

10:46.444 --> 10:49.879
she'll be coming with.
She's a modern gem with modern

10:49.964 --> 10:52.882
gem technology that's
bound to overpower us.

10:52.917 --> 10:56.553
Steven, the truth is...
we're scared.

10:56.620 --> 11:00.957
We've been scared before, right?

11:01.025 --> 11:04.427
None of us know what's going
to happen, but that's okay.
