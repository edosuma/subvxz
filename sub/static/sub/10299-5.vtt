01:21.667 --> 01:23.033
<i>Kelly Bundy,</i>

01:23.067 --> 01:24.500
<i>you have
just been elected</i>

01:24.534 --> 01:27.033
<i>president of
the United States.</i>

01:27.067 --> 01:30.233
<i>What message would you give
to the American people?</i>

01:30.267 --> 01:32.401
<i>Let's dance.</i>

01:40.100 --> 01:41.066
Oh, no.

01:41.100 --> 01:43.867
Not the president
dream again.

01:45.133 --> 01:46.800
Kel?!

01:46.834 --> 01:49.600
Who let the dog
in the White House?

01:51.167 --> 01:52.867
I got a date tonight.

01:52.901 --> 01:54.033
Now...

01:54.067 --> 01:55.567
I need you to smell me,

01:55.601 --> 01:57.334
and tell me
what you think.

01:58.834 --> 02:00.066
Ah.

02:00.100 --> 02:03.767
That daring combination
of Noxzema and Vaseline.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.700
You know...
it has that sexy

02:07.734 --> 02:10.366
"just out of
the hospital" smell.

02:11.100 --> 02:13.900
It's Open Sesame,
you idiot.

02:13.934 --> 02:16.934
The official cologne
of Buster Douglas.

02:16.968 --> 02:19.433
One shot, and you're
down for the count.

02:19.467 --> 02:21.800
Face it, Bud.

02:21.834 --> 02:23.867
You're a cootie.

02:24.934 --> 02:26.567
So you have
two choices.

02:26.601 --> 02:27.667
You can either
go out

02:27.701 --> 02:29.667
with the female version
of yourself,

02:29.701 --> 02:32.767
a cootessa...

02:32.801 --> 02:34.767
or you could try
a human girl,

02:34.801 --> 02:37.401
in which case you're
gonna need money.

02:43.501 --> 02:44.934
I'm home.

02:44.968 --> 02:46.400
Money, money, money.

02:46.434 --> 02:47.700
Back, you dogs!
Back, I say!

02:47.734 --> 02:49.733
Sit! Down! Heel!

02:51.467 --> 02:53.366
I don't have any money,
I swear.

02:53.400 --> 02:55.133
Money, money,
money, money.

02:55.167 --> 02:58.200
No. No. No. Aah-ha.

02:58.234 --> 03:00.600
Jackpot.

03:00.634 --> 03:02.567
Kids, wait a minute.
Your old dad's starving.

03:02.601 --> 03:04.066
Could you please
just...

03:04.100 --> 03:05.833
Ah, who cares?

03:07.167 --> 03:09.300
I'll get my woman
to get me some food.

03:09.767 --> 03:12.100
I wonder where
the monster is.

03:14.467 --> 03:17.200
There's the coffin
opening now.

03:26.501 --> 03:27.467
You know...

03:27.501 --> 03:29.400
I really feel good.

03:29.434 --> 03:30.400
Eight hours at night,

03:30.434 --> 03:32.200
eight hours
during the day.

03:32.801 --> 03:36.166
So you going to work,
coming home, what?

03:36.200 --> 03:37.200
I'm never sure.

03:37.234 --> 03:39.200
I just go where
the car takes me.

03:39.767 --> 03:42.700
Al, what are we
gonna do tonight?

03:42.734 --> 03:43.800
Peg, I thought
tonight

03:43.834 --> 03:45.366
we might do
something different.

03:45.400 --> 03:46.633
You know
the newlywed couple

03:46.667 --> 03:48.800
at the end
of the block?

03:48.834 --> 03:51.700
I peeked
in their window.

03:51.734 --> 03:54.300
Oh, you're
so kinky, baby.

03:54.834 --> 03:56.467
Peg...

03:56.501 --> 03:59.167
I want to do what
they were doing.

04:00.267 --> 04:01.233
Well, I'm game.

04:01.267 --> 04:02.433
What were they doing?

04:02.467 --> 04:04.367
They were eating!

04:09.300 --> 04:10.667
Like everyone else
on the block.

04:10.701 --> 04:13.600
Like on every other block
all across the country.

04:13.634 --> 04:14.767
Feed me. Feed me.

04:14.801 --> 04:16.567
You don't have any food?
That's all right.

04:16.601 --> 04:19.733
Take an arm, cook it up,
pass the ketchup.

04:19.767 --> 04:21.966
<i>Just feed me.</i>

04:22.000 --> 04:24.966
You know what would
take your mind off of food?

04:25.000 --> 04:26.900
Eating?

04:26.934 --> 04:28.200
No, silly.

04:28.234 --> 04:29.667
Taking me out.

04:29.701 --> 04:30.934
Let's go
to the movies.

04:30.968 --> 04:32.900
I know one
we'd both enjoy.

04:32.934 --> 04:36.633
It's Shirley MacLaine,
Glenn Close, Meryl Streep

04:36.667 --> 04:40.900
<i>and Sally Struthers
in Woody Allen's, Oh, My Head.</i>

04:42.534 --> 04:44.666
Please feed me.

04:45.534 --> 04:46.633
Get the door,
honey.

04:46.667 --> 04:48.633
No.

04:48.667 --> 04:52.733
<i>It must be that pizza
I ordered for you.</i>

04:57.133 --> 04:58.834
Hi, Al.

04:58.868 --> 05:01.867
Well, it's flat and cheesy,
but it's no pizza.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.999
Oh, pizza tonight,
huh?

05:11.033 --> 05:14.834
Save up a few
paychecks, did we?

05:14.868 --> 05:18.533
Peg, it's for you.
It's Frosty the No Man.

05:19.067 --> 05:20.133
Now, where's my pizza?

05:20.167 --> 05:22.433
Oh. Honey, you couldn't
really believe

05:22.467 --> 05:24.733
I ordered you a pizza.

05:26.901 --> 05:29.366
God, you are
so funny.

05:29.400 --> 05:30.633
What you doing
tonight, Peg?

05:30.667 --> 05:32.266
Come on, Peg.

05:32.300 --> 05:34.500
You really did order me
a pizza, didn't you?

05:34.534 --> 05:38.566
Oh, of course
I did, honey.

05:43.501 --> 05:46.467
Well, you can see
myevening's entertainment.

05:46.501 --> 05:47.467
What do you
got going?

05:47.501 --> 05:48.567
I'm going dancing.

05:48.601 --> 05:50.233
Hey, since neither
of us has a man,

05:50.267 --> 05:52.234
why don't you join me?

05:53.934 --> 05:56.066
Gee. I don't know.

05:56.100 --> 05:57.733
You know, Peg,
the good thing about it:

05:57.767 --> 06:00.467
If he's more than 20 minutes
late, we get it for free.

06:07.567 --> 06:08.934
Uh...

06:08.968 --> 06:11.166
Dancing, you say?

06:11.200 --> 06:14.667
Al, would you mind
if I went dancing with Marcie?

06:14.701 --> 06:17.333
Peg, I don't care if you
marry her and move in with her.

06:17.367 --> 06:19.700
Peg, did you remember
to order extra cheese?

06:19.734 --> 06:21.800
You know, Peg,
I love extra cheese.

06:21.834 --> 06:24.367
Yes, I know
you do, honey.

06:30.367 --> 06:32.633
It's coming.
It's coming.

06:43.901 --> 06:45.566
Oh, gee.

06:46.167 --> 06:48.633
I-- I don't know if I
should be here, Marce.

06:48.667 --> 06:52.401
I feel guilty having fun
while Al's still alive.

06:53.667 --> 06:56.300
There is nothing wrong
with going out

06:56.334 --> 06:57.800
every now and then
to a classy place

06:57.834 --> 07:00.567
for some good,
innocent fun.

07:00.601 --> 07:02.467
Oh, boys.

07:02.501 --> 07:04.533
Incoming.

07:06.100 --> 07:08.133
Hey, Marcie.

07:08.167 --> 07:09.800
You look terrific.

07:12.267 --> 07:14.633
Oh, look at
the desperation.

07:15.234 --> 07:16.999
It's just everywhere.
Huh.

07:17.033 --> 07:19.934
Can people really be so
hard up for human contact?

07:19.968 --> 07:21.066
Wanna dance?

07:21.100 --> 07:22.767
You bet.

07:25.234 --> 07:26.833
Oh.

07:29.801 --> 07:31.566
Gee.

07:32.033 --> 07:35.200
You're so dry.

07:35.234 --> 07:37.266
I didn't know a man
could be so...

07:37.300 --> 07:38.266
So dry.
Ha-ha-ha!

07:38.300 --> 07:39.733
Well, I...

07:39.767 --> 07:42.700
I never knew a woman
could be so red.

07:45.334 --> 07:46.300
You know...

07:46.334 --> 07:48.133
you dance divinely.

07:48.167 --> 07:49.300
Oh, do you really
think so?

07:49.334 --> 07:50.966
Yeah. I just wonder
if maybe next dance

07:51.000 --> 07:52.833
I could lead?

07:54.300 --> 07:55.833
Oh.

07:58.100 --> 08:00.500
Oh. Oh.

08:00.534 --> 08:02.333
You know, I haven't
done it in two years.

08:02.367 --> 08:04.166
Oh, yeah. You haven't
danced in two years?

08:04.200 --> 08:06.234
Well, I haven't danced
in 12years.

08:11.667 --> 08:12.733
Ohh.

08:12.767 --> 08:14.933
Ah.

08:17.267 --> 08:19.099
Hmm. You know,
at first I thought

08:19.133 --> 08:20.433
you were just
being playful,

08:20.467 --> 08:21.834
but I do believe
that's my wallet

08:21.868 --> 08:23.733
you've got
in your hand.

08:27.934 --> 08:30.966
Oh. I'm sorry.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.566
Ha-ha. Force of habit.
Heh-heh-heh.
Ah.

08:35.567 --> 08:37.167
So...

08:37.634 --> 08:39.732
where are we going?

08:40.433 --> 08:43.400
Anywhere you want,
babe.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.099
Now, I told you...

08:45.133 --> 08:46.400
when you're with me,

08:46.434 --> 08:48.667
the world is
your oyster.

08:48.701 --> 08:51.533
I'm not getting
on a bus.

08:52.200 --> 08:54.767
And I wanna get fed.

08:54.801 --> 08:56.800
No problem.

08:58.868 --> 09:01.934
Dad, I need
20 bucks, fast.

09:01.968 --> 09:04.200
Look what I got
waiting for me.

09:05.501 --> 09:07.666
She's a tramp.

09:19.534 --> 09:21.767
I love
that cologne.

09:25.133 --> 09:26.867
Yeah, right.

09:29.033 --> 09:30.934
Hi, honey.
I ordered you a pizza.

09:30.968 --> 09:33.166
Ah! No, I'm not falling
for that one.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.633
I was at that window
so long,

09:34.667 --> 09:37.099
the neighborhood kids thought
I was a jack-o'- lantern.

09:37.133 --> 09:40.099
<i>Now feed me orfeed me
to something.</i>

09:40.133 --> 09:42.934
I just want to be
part of the food chain.

09:42.968 --> 09:44.934
Al, would you just
forget about food.

09:44.968 --> 09:46.600
Come dancing with me.

09:46.634 --> 09:47.633
It'll be fun.

09:47.667 --> 09:49.366
You can hold me
like you used to.

09:49.400 --> 09:50.600
Oh, come on, Peg.

09:50.634 --> 09:53.566
<i>That was after a six-pack
and a dare.</i>

09:54.934 --> 09:55.900
Well, all right.

09:55.934 --> 09:57.900
I'll go dancing
by myself.

09:57.934 --> 09:59.300
But I'm
warning you.

09:59.334 --> 10:02.233
It's getting harder and harder
to fend off the men.

10:02.267 --> 10:03.567
Well, Peg, I trust you.

10:03.601 --> 10:05.934
But if you do meet another man,
you must promise me this:

10:05.968 --> 10:08.767
Don't feed him,
because that would really hurt.

10:10.033 --> 10:11.500
You stink.

10:11.534 --> 10:13.666
Wash my socks.

10:23.400 --> 10:25.133
Dad?

10:25.167 --> 10:27.867
How come you let Mom
go dancing all the time?

10:27.901 --> 10:30.266
Well, pumpkin, that's just
something married people do

10:30.300 --> 10:32.366
now and then so they don't
have to see each other.

10:32.400 --> 10:34.099
Well, every time
that Mom goes out,

10:34.133 --> 10:36.500
she asks if
it's okay with you.

10:36.534 --> 10:38.400
It's because she
wants you to say,

10:38.434 --> 10:41.433
"Don't go. Stay here with me.
I love you."

10:41.467 --> 10:43.533
See, sometimes people
just test you

10:43.567 --> 10:45.501
to see whether or not
you care.

10:46.133 --> 10:48.667
Anyhow, um...
I'm going out.

10:48.701 --> 10:51.500
I've got a date
with three bikers.

10:51.534 --> 10:53.666
One of them just
got out of prison.

10:54.367 --> 10:55.600
I probably won't be home

10:55.634 --> 10:57.833
till about 3 or 4
in the morning.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.267
Have a nice
time, honey.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.267
Gee, I hope that wasn't
a desperate cry for help.

11:19.701 --> 11:22.501
Oh, well.
At least I'm alone.

11:24.968 --> 11:27.467
Well, I hope that's
a Jehovah Witness...

11:29.634 --> 11:33.600
wanting to discuss hours of
philosophical observation.

11:37.067 --> 11:38.133
You Al Bundy?

11:38.167 --> 11:40.333
Yes. Hold the applause.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.333
What do you want?

11:41.367 --> 11:42.867
I just think
you ought to know,

11:42.901 --> 11:45.933
that your wife has been
seeing my husband.

11:51.968 --> 11:54.933
<i>Let me get this straight.
Pardon the expression.</i>

11:58.801 --> 12:01.533
<i>You say that
your husband</i>

12:01.567 --> 12:02.966
is running around
with my wife.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.066
Yes.

12:04.100 --> 12:05.500
<i>Your husband?</i>

12:05.534 --> 12:07.133
Yes.

12:07.167 --> 12:10.234
You know you're
a guy, right?

12:10.634 --> 12:12.467
Yes.

12:12.501 --> 12:14.767
Well, then, we got three guys
that won't touch my wife.

12:14.801 --> 12:16.666
What's the problem?

12:17.167 --> 12:19.233
It's Andy.

12:19.267 --> 12:21.867
I'm afraid that he's
slipping away from me.

12:21.901 --> 12:24.966
You see,
before me...

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
he had a woman.

12:28.400 --> 12:30.900
Well, before my wife,
I had a woman too.

12:31.968 --> 12:34.867
You don't understand.
This is serious.

12:34.901 --> 12:37.266
He's been leaving the house
every Tuesday and Thursday.

12:37.300 --> 12:39.166
I trail him
in the station wagon.

12:39.200 --> 12:41.133
They dance all night,
they giggle.

12:41.167 --> 12:43.033
She dips him,
she lifts him.

12:43.067 --> 12:44.567
She tosses him
around the room

12:44.601 --> 12:46.999
like Godzilla
with a railroad car.

12:47.033 --> 12:49.099
Oh, my God. What did I do
to deserve this?

12:49.133 --> 12:52.700
Uh, easy, big fella.
Easy there.

12:52.734 --> 12:55.700
I'm sure we can
figure out what happened.

12:55.734 --> 12:59.000
Maybe your guy isn't getting
what he needs at home.

13:00.267 --> 13:01.633
Oh, no, our sex is great.

13:01.667 --> 13:03.633
I don't want to
hear about that.

13:06.300 --> 13:07.366
Do you cook
for him?

13:07.400 --> 13:08.366
Every day.

13:08.400 --> 13:09.433
My mother always said,

13:09.467 --> 13:11.633
"A happy man
is a well-fed man."

13:11.667 --> 13:15.367
And I do feed my man,
I'll tell you that.

13:21.834 --> 13:22.800
Well...

13:22.834 --> 13:24.066
No, yeah, yeah.

13:24.100 --> 13:27.667
Uh...we'd like to know
what you make for him.

13:27.701 --> 13:29.333
Well, tonight,
for example,

13:29.367 --> 13:31.501
I made him
a nice, juicy steak.

13:34.100 --> 13:35.600
Mm-hm. And, uh,
what else?

13:35.634 --> 13:37.834
Uh, nice baked potato.

13:37.868 --> 13:39.366
You made it yourself?

13:39.400 --> 13:40.934
It's-- It's not the kind
where he has

13:40.968 --> 13:43.999
to go to the door and wait,
and the potato never comes?

13:44.033 --> 13:45.533
Uh, no.

13:45.567 --> 13:48.066
But that's terrible
when that happens.

13:48.100 --> 13:49.867
Well...maybe he's
just tired

13:49.901 --> 13:50.867
of you sitting
at home

13:50.901 --> 13:51.934
while he's out
working.

13:51.968 --> 13:53.033
No, I work.

13:53.067 --> 13:55.433
I'm an office manager,
40 thou a year.

13:55.467 --> 13:57.633
That bastard!

13:59.167 --> 14:00.867
Guys like that
deserve what they get.

14:00.901 --> 14:01.900
He's getting your wife.

14:01.934 --> 14:04.467
Well, let the punishment
fit the crime.

14:09.100 --> 14:10.500
I don't know.

14:10.534 --> 14:12.200
Maybe it's my fault.

14:12.234 --> 14:13.800
Andy's a man
about town,

14:13.834 --> 14:15.333
whereas I just
like to stay home

14:15.367 --> 14:16.500
and watch
a ball game.

14:16.534 --> 14:18.033
Wait a second.

14:18.067 --> 14:19.800
Wait a second.

14:19.834 --> 14:21.966
You-- You work,
you cook...

14:22.000 --> 14:23.667
and you like
sports?

14:23.701 --> 14:24.667
Yeah.

14:24.701 --> 14:25.900
Except for soccer.

14:25.934 --> 14:28.666
I mean, that's not
really a man's game.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.134
I love you.

14:44.834 --> 14:47.034
You know, I just
don't understand it.

14:48.501 --> 14:50.966
I mean, I know that
Andy's crazy about me,

14:51.000 --> 14:53.366
and yet he hasn't
made a move on me.

14:53.400 --> 14:55.567
He's been
a total gentleman. Huh.

14:55.601 --> 14:56.834
What's wrong with him?

14:56.868 --> 14:59.133
Oh, who cares?

14:59.167 --> 15:02.134
You gotta see
this guy's tattoo.

15:02.534 --> 15:04.434
It's a ship.

15:05.067 --> 15:07.666
You should see
his sub.

15:11.667 --> 15:14.533
You know, it's not like I wanna
do anything with Andy.

15:14.567 --> 15:17.066
I just want to turn him on,
drive him wild,

15:17.100 --> 15:20.000
make him sweat,
and then say no.

15:20.667 --> 15:23.234
Just like I always meant to
in high school.

15:29.934 --> 15:32.533
Hiya, beautiful.

15:36.601 --> 15:38.066
Oh.

15:38.100 --> 15:41.600
So, uh, do you
find me...

15:42.634 --> 15:43.667
beautiful?

15:43.701 --> 15:45.300
I think...

15:45.334 --> 15:46.700
you are
the most beautiful woman

15:46.734 --> 15:47.733
I've ever known.

15:47.767 --> 15:48.767
Except for
my mother.

15:48.801 --> 15:51.367
And, of course,
Judy Garland.

15:53.734 --> 15:58.100
Oh, Andy. You're
embarrassing me. Ha-ha-ha!

15:59.367 --> 16:02.600
Um...I've got something
to tell you.

16:02.634 --> 16:05.933
I bet you do.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.667
Ahh.

16:08.701 --> 16:10.066
Well, I wanna
be honest with you,

16:10.100 --> 16:12.834
because you've always been
honest with me, Lola.

16:12.868 --> 16:14.767
Oh, Andy.

16:14.801 --> 16:16.934
I know what it is
that you have to say.

16:16.968 --> 16:19.567
But before your passion
bursts into flame,

16:19.601 --> 16:21.200
I have to tell you:

16:21.234 --> 16:23.999
You can't have me,
because, uh...

16:24.033 --> 16:26.334
I'm engaged.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.999
Oh...all right.

16:30.033 --> 16:31.333
I'm married.

16:31.367 --> 16:34.300
I have a confession
to make too.

16:34.334 --> 16:35.633
I'm also married.

16:35.667 --> 16:37.733
You pig.

16:37.767 --> 16:40.200
You've got a lot of nerve
leading me on.

16:40.234 --> 16:41.433
I didn't mean to.

16:41.467 --> 16:43.233
I just-- I just wanted
to have a good time,

16:43.267 --> 16:44.733
and, you know,
get out of the house.

16:44.767 --> 16:46.400
Besides, just because
you're married

16:46.434 --> 16:47.600
doesn't mean
you're dead.

16:47.634 --> 16:50.334
It doesn't mean
you're alive either.

16:54.234 --> 16:55.800
Oh.

16:56.868 --> 16:59.366
You know, the one good thing
about us both being married is,

16:59.400 --> 17:02.834
it sort of takes the pressure
out of this flirtation.
Yeah.

17:02.868 --> 17:05.599
I mean, you don't have to
worry about turning me on,

17:05.634 --> 17:08.134
and I don't have to worry
about turning you on.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.433
But if that
should happen,

17:16.467 --> 17:19.733
then that's just something
you'll have to deal with.

17:33.133 --> 17:36.099
Oh, I like to see a man
enjoying his food.

17:36.133 --> 17:37.099
Mmm-um.

17:37.133 --> 17:38.867
Want some cake?

17:43.234 --> 17:44.966
Hey...

17:45.000 --> 17:46.834
it's warm.

17:46.868 --> 17:48.700
Yeah. I just baked it.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.366
I'm sorry about
using a dog dish,

17:50.400 --> 17:51.800
but you have no plates.

17:51.834 --> 17:53.366
That's okay.

17:53.400 --> 17:54.966
See?

17:55.000 --> 17:57.434
It says my name
on the side.

18:03.033 --> 18:05.099
What are you sitting
all the way over there for?

18:05.133 --> 18:06.666
Come
over here.

18:09.601 --> 18:11.266
Mmm. Mmm.

18:11.300 --> 18:12.999
Mm.

18:13.033 --> 18:14.934
Al, you gotta help me.

18:14.968 --> 18:16.800
I want my husband back.

18:16.834 --> 18:19.501
Isn't there any way
you can talk to him?

18:20.234 --> 18:23.833
<i>Hm, uh, I don't know, Pete.
What about us?</i>

18:26.000 --> 18:28.333
Won't that interfere
with our quality time?

18:28.367 --> 18:30.966
No. No, no, Al.
I'll make time.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.700
I'll make time for you.

18:32.734 --> 18:34.300
We'll go to
a ball game.

18:34.334 --> 18:36.033
I'll make us
a picnic basket...

18:36.067 --> 18:37.934
with crispy
fried chicken.

18:37.968 --> 18:40.366
Huh?

18:40.400 --> 18:42.567
Huh?

18:42.601 --> 18:44.233
I'll even get you
your very own bowl.

18:44.267 --> 18:46.266
My own dog bowl?

18:46.300 --> 18:47.934
With just
my name on it?

18:47.968 --> 18:49.667
It sounds too good
to be true, but--

18:49.701 --> 18:51.533
You're not just saying that,
are you, Pete?

18:51.567 --> 18:53.999
I'm not
a food tease, Al.

18:54.033 --> 18:55.366
I'll fry for you,

18:55.400 --> 18:57.800
<i>if you can
get my man back.</i>

18:58.467 --> 19:00.099
I'll do it.

19:00.133 --> 19:01.967
To you, Al.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.334
To us.

19:07.367 --> 19:08.433
A shoe salesman?

19:08.467 --> 19:11.733
Come on. Nobody's
a shoe salesman.

19:12.834 --> 19:15.433
Well, he thought he'd
start at the bottom

19:15.467 --> 19:17.000
and stay there.

19:17.501 --> 19:19.600
Ah.

19:23.234 --> 19:24.900
Oh, my God,
it's Al.

19:24.934 --> 19:26.800
I'm out of here.
No, you're not.

19:26.834 --> 19:28.066
Hold me tight.

19:28.100 --> 19:29.133
Maybe he'll get jealous

19:29.167 --> 19:30.700
and finally show me
some attention.

19:30.734 --> 19:31.867
No. He's awfully big.

19:31.901 --> 19:33.166
Yes, and he's tough too.

19:33.200 --> 19:35.666
But don't worry,
I won't let him hurt you.

19:36.934 --> 19:38.366
How dare you.

19:38.400 --> 19:40.533
Oh, Al.

19:40.567 --> 19:41.999
I'm so glad
you're here.

19:42.033 --> 19:44.200
The things
he wanted me to do.

19:44.234 --> 19:46.501
Kick a hole
in him, honey.

19:48.467 --> 19:49.633
Is your name Andy?

19:49.667 --> 19:50.633
Yes, sir.

19:50.667 --> 19:52.200
Get over there!

19:52.234 --> 19:53.767
Ooh, Marcie.

19:53.801 --> 19:56.700
Al's gonna kick the hell
out of Andy.

19:57.501 --> 19:59.200
<i>He does care.</i>

19:59.234 --> 20:02.134
Look, I don't care what
you're doing with my wife.

20:03.801 --> 20:05.233
But you got
a good man at home

20:05.267 --> 20:08.100
that any man would be
proud to call his wife.

20:09.300 --> 20:11.633
He cooks, he cleans,
he works.

20:11.667 --> 20:12.934
You've obviously
gotten over

20:12.968 --> 20:15.367
that little
"he's a man" thing.

20:16.534 --> 20:18.533
So, what else do you want
from the poor guy?

20:18.567 --> 20:19.600
Oh, Marcie.

20:19.634 --> 20:22.233
Al's so cute
when he's jealous.

20:22.267 --> 20:24.400
Now, I'm the one that
ought to be going out at night.

20:24.434 --> 20:26.433
I'm married to that
over there.

20:26.467 --> 20:28.999
But you... You ought to be
home with a man

20:29.033 --> 20:32.100
who can bake a potato
like nobody's business.

20:33.033 --> 20:35.334
You had Pete's potato?

20:38.767 --> 20:40.266
I did.

20:40.300 --> 20:42.066
And I would have had
his peach cobbler too,

20:42.100 --> 20:44.566
if the damn dog didn't come
get his bowl back.

20:45.701 --> 20:46.867
Now you go home
and tell

20:46.901 --> 20:48.666
your wife that
you love him.

20:49.667 --> 20:50.667
You're right, Al.

20:50.701 --> 20:52.233
And if you don't mind
my saying so,

20:52.267 --> 20:53.999
you should go tell
your wife you love her.

20:54.033 --> 20:56.467
Mind your own business.
Sorry.

20:57.868 --> 20:59.099
Well...

20:59.133 --> 21:00.966
guess I've got a wife
to go talk to.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.733
Oh, yeah.
Me too.

21:13.467 --> 21:16.834
Well...Mr. I-Don't-Care-
What-You-Do.

21:16.868 --> 21:18.467
Paint you green.

21:18.501 --> 21:19.800
<i>You were jealous.</i>

21:19.834 --> 21:21.834
Uh, I was not jealous.

21:21.868 --> 21:23.066
Was too.

21:23.100 --> 21:24.333
Admit you care.

21:24.367 --> 21:25.800
Oh...

21:25.834 --> 21:27.567
Would that make you happy?

21:27.601 --> 21:29.333
Yes.

21:29.367 --> 21:32.633
Uh. I care.

21:33.434 --> 21:34.700
I'm not convinced.

21:34.734 --> 21:37.367
That's because
I don't care.

21:37.834 --> 21:38.867
Come and dance
with me.

21:38.901 --> 21:40.400
Oh, I care,
I care.

21:40.434 --> 21:43.234
Too late. Too late.

21:47.634 --> 21:50.200
Gee, Andy was real
good-looking, huh?

21:50.234 --> 21:54.099
I'm trying to
count here, Peg.

21:54.133 --> 21:56.333
You know, this ought to be
a lesson to you, Al.

21:56.367 --> 21:59.033
If you don't want me,
there's plenty of guys that do.

21:59.067 --> 22:00.767
Right, Peg.

22:01.434 --> 22:03.767
You should have seen
the way he looked at me.

22:03.801 --> 22:06.333
<i>He wanted me bad.</i>

22:06.367 --> 22:08.700
Mm. Everybody wants
you bad, Peg.

22:08.734 --> 22:10.934
Every one of us.

22:10.968 --> 22:13.934
Oh, admit you're lucky
to have me as your wife.

22:13.968 --> 22:15.633
I could've had anyone.

22:15.667 --> 22:18.867
I could've had Andy at
the snap of a finger. Heh-heh.

22:18.901 --> 22:22.033
<i>He was sexy.
He was hot.</i>

22:22.067 --> 22:23.567
He was...

22:23.601 --> 22:26.434
He was a homo,
Peg.
