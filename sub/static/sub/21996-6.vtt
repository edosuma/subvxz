No, but I do have this theory
that I see its actual form

rather than the facade
that it puts on for him.

before this family is finally
free of its possession

41:38.922 --> 41:41.456
by a dark, malicious entity.

41:41.458 --> 41:44.258
We beseech thee, hear us
that thou wouldst deign

41:44.260 --> 41:47.962
to reconcile
and sanctify this cemetery.

41:47.964 --> 41:50.998
Sprinkle me with hyssop, O Lord,
and I shall be clean.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.434
Wash me, and I shall be
whiter than snow.

41:53.436 --> 41:56.170
Thou who shall come to judge
the living and the dead

41:56.172 --> 41:58.139
and the world by fire.
