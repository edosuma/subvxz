00:00.033 --> 00:02.969
<i>- Previously on</i> gotham...
- I've been sober for a year.

00:02.971 --> 00:05.171
That doesn't erase
the things that I did,

00:05.173 --> 00:06.773
But I still care about you.

00:06.775 --> 00:07.974
<i>"dear jim, I thought I could be</i>

00:07.976 --> 00:09.175
<i>"strong and brave for you,</i>

00:09.177 --> 00:10.810
<i>"but I can't.</i>

00:10.812 --> 00:12.212
<i>"I'm going away for a while</i>

00:12.214 --> 00:13.546
<i>To get myself together."</i>

00:13.548 --> 00:15.448
<i>Trust me, and I'll trust you.</i>

00:15.450 --> 00:16.549
In the meantime,

00:16.551 --> 00:19.953
Each of your tariffs
will increase 25%.

00:19.955 --> 00:21.454
Reach out to saviano
and turski.

00:21.456 --> 00:23.356
They are worried about
ending up like bannion.

00:23.358 --> 00:25.992
<i>The old man is herding
his sheep toward me.</i>

00:25.994 --> 00:27.394
Arrogant clown.

00:27.396 --> 00:28.728
Try to take
me down?

00:28.730 --> 00:30.563
You do not know
where the edge is.

00:30.565 --> 00:31.731
<i>Arkham asylum?</i>

00:31.733 --> 00:33.366
<i>Security guard for nut jobs?</i>

00:33.368 --> 00:34.634
It's that or quit.
So quit.

00:34.636 --> 00:36.069
That's what they want me to do.

00:36.071 --> 00:37.737
<i>Falcone, the mayor...</i>

00:37.739 --> 00:39.305
<i>I'm not gonna stop, harvey.</i>

00:39.307 --> 00:40.640
<i>I'm gonna get 'em.</i>

00:46.080 --> 00:48.181
<i>If thou neglect'st
or dost unwillingly</i>

00:48.183 --> 00:50.417
What I command,

00:50.419 --> 00:53.553
I'll rack thee with old cramps.

00:53.555 --> 00:56.189
Fill all thy bones

00:56.191 --> 00:58.224
With aches,

00:58.226 --> 00:59.592
Make thee roar

00:59.594 --> 01:02.495
That beasts shall

01:02.497 --> 01:04.931
Tremble at thy din.

01:04.933 --> 01:05.933
Go, go.

01:05.934 --> 01:06.934
No.

01:06.935 --> 01:08.501
Pray thee.

01:08.503 --> 01:11.171
I must obey.

01:11.173 --> 01:15.108
His art is of such power...

01:15.110 --> 01:18.111
Such power...

01:18.113 --> 01:21.514
"it will control my dam's god."

01:21.516 --> 01:23.616
It would control

01:23.618 --> 01:26.186
My dam's god setebos

01:26.188 --> 01:29.422
And make a vassal of him.

01:30.524 --> 01:32.692
So, slave, hence.

01:33.694 --> 01:35.395
Hence.

Ha!

02:29.651 --> 02:32.152
Don't kill me!

02:37.626 --> 02:39.159
Stay down.

02:43.764 --> 02:47.600
This is the fourth inmate
outburst in as many weeks

02:47.602 --> 02:48.668
As you've been stationed here.

02:48.670 --> 02:50.703
I understand
this is

02:50.705 --> 02:52.672
Punishment duty for you,

02:52.674 --> 02:55.141
But I expect professional
standards nonetheless.

02:55.143 --> 02:56.676
This is unacceptable,
gordon.

02:56.678 --> 02:58.545
Unacceptable.

02:58.547 --> 03:00.547
It's my fault,
mr. Lang.

03:00.549 --> 03:02.215
The play was
too upsetting.

03:02.217 --> 03:04.617
We'll stick to comedies
from now on, I think.

03:04.619 --> 03:05.785
Thank you,
nurse duncan.

03:05.787 --> 03:07.787
It's "director" or "dr. Lang,"

03:07.789 --> 03:08.955
As you prefer.

03:08.957 --> 03:10.790
Recreational
activities

03:10.792 --> 03:12.659
Are not pertinent
to this conversation.

03:12.661 --> 03:15.228
Officer gordon
is responsible

03:15.230 --> 03:17.864
For security
on this wing,

03:17.866 --> 03:20.800
A task which he seems
unable to manage.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.470
What have you to say
about this, gordon?

03:25.472 --> 03:27.540
This man needs
medical attention.

03:27.542 --> 03:29.142
I'd see to him myself,

03:29.144 --> 03:30.710
But there's rules.

03:30.712 --> 03:33.313
I dispense meds, not treatment.

03:33.315 --> 03:34.581
He needs a doctor.

03:34.583 --> 03:36.583
Very well.

03:36.585 --> 03:39.719
I'll send one in.

03:41.689 --> 03:43.489
Any more
incidents,

03:43.491 --> 03:45.992
And I'll have you placed
on the remedial duty roster.

03:47.161 --> 03:49.562
Think you can't fall
any farther?

03:49.564 --> 03:51.631
Think again.

03:53.000 --> 03:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:06.380 --> 04:07.614
How is he?

04:10.352 --> 04:11.684
He's fine.

04:11.686 --> 04:13.453
Will be.

04:13.455 --> 04:15.088
And you?

04:15.090 --> 04:16.089
I'm good.

04:16.091 --> 04:17.824
Few bruises.

04:20.127 --> 04:21.560
What?

04:21.563 --> 04:22.729
You're the famous

04:22.731 --> 04:24.731
Detective jim gordon,
aren't you?

04:24.733 --> 04:25.932
That's my name.

04:25.934 --> 04:27.300
I'm not sure about "famous."

04:27.302 --> 04:28.901
Notorious, then?

04:28.903 --> 04:30.370
Nearer the mark.

04:30.372 --> 04:31.571
Who are you?

04:31.573 --> 04:33.706
Leslie thompkins.

04:33.708 --> 04:34.974
Dr. Thompkins.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.611
You work here?

04:38.613 --> 04:40.747
I'm not an inmate.

04:40.749 --> 04:43.116
I haven't seen you
on infirmary duty before.

04:43.118 --> 04:44.584
I work in the female ward.

04:44.586 --> 04:46.653
I come over here
when they're short-handed.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.856
All the girls
are talking about you.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.825
Brave detective brought low

04:52.827 --> 04:54.127
By fighting city hall.

04:54.129 --> 04:55.795
Ah.

04:55.797 --> 04:57.430
They say that, do they?

04:57.432 --> 05:00.433
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to make light of your situation.

05:00.435 --> 05:03.269
It's okay.

05:03.271 --> 05:05.505
Personally, I think
what you're doing is admirable.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.274
I'm guarding lunatics.

05:08.276 --> 05:09.842
No. You're not quitting.

05:09.844 --> 05:11.744
Not yet.

05:13.747 --> 05:15.348
Who are you?

05:15.350 --> 05:16.683
Oh, sorry.

05:16.685 --> 05:18.084
I didn't mean to blurt
all that out like I did.

05:18.086 --> 05:19.485
It's none of my business.

05:19.487 --> 05:20.687
Uh,
dr. Thompkins,

05:20.689 --> 05:23.356
You sure this inmate's
gonna be okay?

05:23.358 --> 05:24.791
He's fine.

05:24.793 --> 05:26.326
He's just sleeping off his meds.

05:26.328 --> 05:27.760
I'm trying.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.897
Get a room, you guys.

05:32.599 --> 05:33.833
I should go.

05:33.835 --> 05:34.834
It's nice to meet you, jim.

05:34.836 --> 05:36.769
Likewise.

06:05.867 --> 06:07.934
Ivy?

06:10.070 --> 06:12.038
How you doing?

06:12.040 --> 06:13.973
I... I'm good.

06:13.975 --> 06:15.408
I'm good.

06:15.410 --> 06:16.709
You look sick.

06:16.711 --> 06:18.177
Like you need a doctor.

06:18.179 --> 06:19.512
No doctors.

06:19.514 --> 06:21.381
N... Never, ever again.

06:21.383 --> 06:23.916
I-I'm fine.

06:23.918 --> 06:25.985
I-I was resting.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.563
I got a place we can go, ivy.

06:37.565 --> 06:38.898
Come on.

06:38.900 --> 06:40.967
I-I-I, I'm
shivery is all.

06:44.773 --> 06:45.773
Okay.

06:47.742 --> 06:49.809
Come on.

07:26.313 --> 07:28.347
They're gone.

07:29.316 --> 07:30.783
It's safe.

07:30.785 --> 07:32.885
Sure?

07:32.887 --> 07:35.288
Sure as sure.

07:35.290 --> 07:37.924
We'll only stay until
you feel better.

07:37.926 --> 07:40.793
Come and lay down
on the couch there.

07:40.795 --> 07:43.930
Wh... What if the real
people come home?

07:43.932 --> 07:45.832
There's dust on
everything

07:45.834 --> 07:47.800
And something
smells rotten.

07:47.802 --> 07:50.136
Nobody's
coming.

07:50.138 --> 07:51.471
Whose place is
this, anyways?

07:51.473 --> 07:52.972
How come you ask so
many questions, ivy?

07:52.974 --> 07:54.640
I'm trying
to help you.

07:54.642 --> 07:56.576
Now lie down
and I'll get
you a blanket.

08:11.658 --> 08:12.992
Morning, gentlemen.

08:12.994 --> 08:15.928
Have you considered
my proposition?

08:15.930 --> 08:16.996
Uh, yeah.

08:16.998 --> 08:17.998
No.

08:17.999 --> 08:19.332
No?

08:19.334 --> 08:20.334
We already pay enough.

08:20.335 --> 08:21.868
Don maroni set the rates
last year.

08:21.870 --> 08:23.936
And now I'm raising
the prices.

08:23.938 --> 08:25.838
Inflation is a bitch.

08:25.840 --> 08:27.340
Maroni said...

08:27.342 --> 08:28.875
Maroni, maroni....

08:28.877 --> 08:30.643
You're beginning to irk me.

08:30.645 --> 08:33.446
You're talking to me,
the penguin.

08:33.448 --> 08:34.514
So you're penguin.

08:34.515 --> 08:35.881
So what?

08:35.884 --> 08:37.183
I called the cops on you.

08:37.184 --> 08:40.453
It's <i> the</i> penguin.

08:40.455 --> 08:42.154
And that was a very
naive call to make.

08:43.491 --> 08:45.625
Hello, we own the cops
on the waterfront.

08:45.627 --> 08:46.993
Tell that to the cops, buddy.

08:50.364 --> 08:52.031
Boys.

08:52.033 --> 08:53.199
Why the frowns?

09:11.485 --> 09:14.053
Jones?

09:15.489 --> 09:18.291
Jones.

09:29.403 --> 09:31.470
Hey, frogman.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.143
Hey.

09:40.614 --> 09:41.681
Hey.

09:58.029 --> 09:59.129
These are electrode wounds.

09:59.131 --> 10:00.931
This man was
given a crude,

10:00.933 --> 10:03.033
Invasive kind of
electroshock therapy.

10:03.035 --> 10:05.102
Metal needles were
inserted into the brain

10:05.104 --> 10:06.637
And electricity was applied
to his frontal lobes.

10:06.639 --> 10:08.105
What for?

10:08.107 --> 10:10.107
Surgically, it's used
to modify aberrant behavior,

10:10.109 --> 10:11.976
But in this case, way
too much voltage was used

10:11.978 --> 10:13.877
And his brain is
completely fried.

10:13.879 --> 10:16.380
Another under your watch,
gordon?

10:16.382 --> 10:17.781
How did this happen?

10:17.783 --> 10:20.117
You rushed
into opening,

10:20.119 --> 10:21.719
And now you're
running this place

10:21.721 --> 10:23.754
With skeleton staff
and zero surveillance

10:23.756 --> 10:26.390
In an unsafe and unsecure
200-year-old maze.

10:26.392 --> 10:28.325
Excellent. Excuses.

10:28.327 --> 10:30.327
That's that nature
of municipal operations.

10:30.329 --> 10:33.063
You inherit problems

10:33.065 --> 10:35.132
And you use the resources
at hand to do with you can.

10:35.134 --> 10:37.134
Well, our resources don't
stretch nearly far enough

10:37.136 --> 10:39.637
To cover a criminal
assault investigation.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.005
We should call the gcpd.

10:41.007 --> 10:44.208
No, this is
an in-house medical issue.

10:46.144 --> 10:48.012
He still breathing?

10:48.014 --> 10:50.247
Well, yes, but he's
effectively brain dead.

10:50.249 --> 10:51.348
What does...

10:51.350 --> 10:52.683
He's still breathing.

10:52.685 --> 10:54.284
Unaided.

10:54.286 --> 10:55.953
For all official purposes, well,

10:55.955 --> 10:58.455
He's still alive.

10:58.457 --> 11:00.124
Keep him comfortable, doctor.

11:00.126 --> 11:03.293
Officer gordon?

11:03.295 --> 11:05.029
I want you
to find out which one

11:05.031 --> 11:07.264
Of our charming inmates
did this.

11:07.266 --> 11:11.268
I want a report
on my desk Friday.

11:20.845 --> 11:22.012
Another day, another dollar.

11:22.014 --> 11:24.014
Really? This is rather usual

11:24.016 --> 11:25.616
And sinister, isn't it?

11:25.618 --> 11:28.352
Yes.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.621
So, who are we looking for?

11:30.623 --> 11:32.890
What does it take
to pull this off?

11:32.892 --> 11:34.191
Uh...

11:34.193 --> 11:36.226
Some basic knowledge
of human anatomy.

11:36.228 --> 11:38.128
Um, basic electrical skills.

11:38.130 --> 11:39.697
A circuit board,

11:39.699 --> 11:40.731
Some wiring.

11:40.733 --> 11:41.899
Is that all?

11:41.901 --> 11:43.667
And the door keys, of course.

11:43.669 --> 11:45.069
"the door keys."

11:45.071 --> 11:47.471
Right.

11:47.473 --> 11:50.040
No, man, I got
my keys right here.

11:50.042 --> 11:51.542
Look at me, steven.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.077
Look at me.

11:55.013 --> 11:56.547
Tell me the truth.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.182
Why you picking on me?

11:58.184 --> 12:00.050
There's five other guards
with keys to this wing.

12:00.052 --> 12:01.819
True, and you're
the only one who looks

12:01.821 --> 12:03.353
And smells like a hunted animal.

12:03.355 --> 12:05.889
Look, steven.

12:05.891 --> 12:07.858
Whoever fried frogman had keys.

12:07.860 --> 12:09.493
Now, we've searched
all the inmates' cells.

12:09.495 --> 12:11.161
No keys.

12:11.163 --> 12:12.396
But I know they're out there.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.098
And I need to know where.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.166
I'm backed up
against the wall here.

12:16.168 --> 12:18.736
And I'm starting to lose my
patience... do you understand?

12:19.838 --> 12:23.373
That fight... During the play.

12:23.375 --> 12:25.509
Right after, I noticed
my keys were gone.

12:25.511 --> 12:28.112
You lose equipment,
that's a big deal.

12:28.114 --> 12:30.581
They dock me a week's pay,
so I tracked done a spare set!

12:30.583 --> 12:31.749
Who took the keys?

12:31.751 --> 12:32.883
I don't know.

12:32.885 --> 12:34.151
Anyone could've taken them.

12:36.855 --> 12:38.288
Walk away.

12:38.290 --> 12:39.389
Sorry...

12:39.391 --> 12:41.959
Walk away!

12:46.265 --> 12:48.398
<i>And then he raises our taxes</i>

12:48.400 --> 12:50.434
After his money blows up.

12:50.436 --> 12:51.969
Killed bannion like
he was nobody.

12:51.971 --> 12:53.403
I'll say it.

12:53.405 --> 12:55.639
I wish something would happen
to old man falcone

12:55.641 --> 12:57.941
Before he comes after one of us.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.276
That's where this is going.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.245
Slow down. Now, let's imagine

13:01.247 --> 13:03.313
God forbid anything
happened to falcone.

13:03.315 --> 13:04.915
Just for kicks...

13:04.917 --> 13:06.750
Who would take over then?

13:06.752 --> 13:07.951
Who would take over?

13:07.953 --> 13:09.052
I do.

13:09.054 --> 13:10.754
You?

13:10.756 --> 13:13.624
Now, that never occurred to me.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.292
What never occurred?

13:15.294 --> 13:17.227
I'm next in line. Seniority.

13:17.229 --> 13:19.429
That's the way the system works.

13:19.431 --> 13:22.166
That's how the system used
to work back in the day.

13:22.168 --> 13:23.967
It's a new dawn,
a new city.

13:23.969 --> 13:25.402
I would believe we would need

13:25.404 --> 13:27.504
Some fresh thinking at the top.

13:27.506 --> 13:29.506
And who is the fresh thinker
that you got in mind?

13:29.508 --> 13:30.974
Let me guess.

13:31.943 --> 13:32.976
Who?

13:32.978 --> 13:34.244
Her.

13:34.246 --> 13:35.345
She's talking about her.

13:35.347 --> 13:36.980
Oh.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.515
Really?

13:38.517 --> 13:41.118
You don't think
I could run the family?

13:41.120 --> 13:42.186
Hey, no, why not?

13:42.188 --> 13:43.921
Woman's lib and all that.

13:43.923 --> 13:46.924
But fair play,
jimmy is next in line.

13:47.992 --> 13:49.693
Well, there's no need to argue.

13:49.695 --> 13:52.095
It's all hypotheticals anyhow.

13:52.097 --> 13:55.232
We're just talking, right?

13:59.270 --> 14:02.840
Inmate 5075 jack gruber.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.876
Inmate gruber?

14:05.878 --> 14:08.612
Did you take
officer wenger's keys?

14:08.614 --> 14:11.815
You're looking into
the sad demise of the frogman.

14:11.817 --> 14:14.184
The frogman disrupted
your play last night.

14:14.186 --> 14:15.686
Yeah.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.654
You didn't like him
very much, did you?

14:17.656 --> 14:19.356
Well, I had no
opinion of him.

14:19.358 --> 14:21.358
He was called the frogman
because he believed

14:21.360 --> 14:23.794
A giant bullfrog lived
inside his abdomen,

14:23.796 --> 14:25.429
Controlling his thoughts.

14:27.198 --> 14:28.465
He was already dead.

14:28.467 --> 14:30.467
I don't waste psychic energy
on the dead.

14:33.071 --> 14:35.239
Rape, murder...

14:35.241 --> 14:37.841
You're no stranger
to violence, gruber.

14:37.843 --> 14:41.311
Your psych evals say
you're a grade-a sociopath.

14:41.313 --> 14:43.847
Why should I take your word
for anything?

14:43.849 --> 14:46.416
You shouldn't believe
everything you read, jim.

14:46.418 --> 14:48.652
May I call you jim?

14:48.654 --> 14:50.320
Did you take the keys?
Please,

14:50.322 --> 14:52.322
Search my cell if you do
not find me trustworthy,

14:52.324 --> 14:57.794
But, no, jim, I did not
take anyone's keys.

15:01.032 --> 15:02.532
Thank you.

15:02.534 --> 15:04.167
Guard?

15:04.169 --> 15:07.404
Did you take
officer wenger's keys?

15:08.841 --> 15:10.207
No.

15:13.711 --> 15:14.811
Hey. Hey!

15:18.117 --> 15:19.283
Settle down.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.352
S-settle down.
- Settle down.

15:22.354 --> 15:24.354
Did you take off...

15:28.193 --> 15:30.427
You have the keys?

15:37.069 --> 15:40.070
Get the straps!
Need a restraint!

15:40.072 --> 15:42.205
Keys?
Yes.

15:42.207 --> 15:44.875
Keys. Did you take
the guard's keys?

15:44.877 --> 15:47.644
No. Am I in trouble?

15:47.646 --> 15:49.246
No, aaron,

15:49.248 --> 15:51.448
Unless you're lying to me.

15:51.450 --> 15:52.382
Lying?

15:52.384 --> 15:53.784
Aaron never lies,

15:53.786 --> 15:55.218
Mr. Gordon.

15:55.220 --> 15:56.720
He doesn't have the concept,

15:56.722 --> 15:59.189
Poor peaceful soul that he is.

16:00.158 --> 16:03.126
He killed his family
with an axe.

16:03.128 --> 16:05.429
Isn't that
what you did, aaron?

16:05.431 --> 16:09.366
Never harmed a fly before
or since.

16:10.335 --> 16:13.303
I said sorry.

16:13.305 --> 16:15.138
Okay, aaron.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.506
You're free to go.

16:16.508 --> 16:19.176
Thank you. Guard?

16:34.592 --> 16:36.593
You saw how that went.

16:36.595 --> 16:38.428
Saviano's the problem.

16:38.430 --> 16:41.164
Now, on his own, janacek,
I can turn him around.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.166
And the junior capos
will follow him.

16:43.168 --> 16:46.003
But that saviano,
we got to deal with him

16:46.005 --> 16:47.804
Before we make our move
on maroni.

16:47.806 --> 16:49.606
Why not let me talk
to saviano

16:49.608 --> 16:52.542
On my own?
Me and jimmy go way back.

16:52.544 --> 16:55.278
That's true. You do go way back.

16:56.481 --> 16:57.881
What would you tell him?

16:57.883 --> 16:59.616
I'd say you're
the best candidate.

16:59.618 --> 17:01.018
He knows that.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.953
He just can't admit it
to your face.

17:02.955 --> 17:04.621
Too proud.

17:04.623 --> 17:07.023
Okay then.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.892
Talk to him.

17:08.894 --> 17:10.327
Will do.

17:10.329 --> 17:11.795
Butch,

17:11.797 --> 17:14.397
You're not turning on me,
are you?

17:14.400 --> 17:15.665
Ho!

17:15.666 --> 17:18.234
What kind of question is that?

17:18.237 --> 17:20.537
Why would you even joke
about something like that?

17:20.539 --> 17:22.539
I'm just asking.

17:22.540 --> 17:25.842
A girl gets insecure
once in a while.

18:18.129 --> 18:20.597
Royston, what are you doing
out of your cell?

18:20.599 --> 18:22.566
Hey, cut it out!

18:22.568 --> 18:24.968
Full fathom five
thy father lies.

18:24.970 --> 18:27.971
Of his bones are coral made.

18:27.973 --> 18:30.640
Aw, hell.

18:42.452 --> 18:44.753
Royston,
is that your name?

18:44.755 --> 18:47.556
Sea nymphs hourly ring
his knell.

18:47.558 --> 18:49.258
Fascinating.

18:49.260 --> 18:51.594
The poor man can walk and talk,
but all he remembers are lines

18:51.596 --> 18:52.728
From the play.

18:52.730 --> 18:54.130
Same electroshock technique

18:54.132 --> 18:57.133
As frogman but with slightly
less drastic results.

18:57.135 --> 18:59.635
It's like whoever's doing this
is improving their methods.

18:59.637 --> 19:01.637
Or maybe their process
is so haphazard, they don't know

19:01.639 --> 19:03.973
What kind of outcome
they're gonna get.

19:03.975 --> 19:06.175
One man ends up
a vegetable,

19:06.177 --> 19:09.178
While the other one
recites shakespeare on a loop.

19:09.180 --> 19:11.914
I don't understand
what an inmate gains

19:11.916 --> 19:14.316
From scrambling up
another inmate.

19:17.487 --> 19:19.488
You should stay
on the female wing for a while.

19:19.490 --> 19:21.490
There's no reason
to put yourself in danger.

19:21.492 --> 19:23.492
I'm perfectly capable
of protecting myself.

19:23.494 --> 19:25.294
Besides, my patients need me.

19:25.296 --> 19:26.662
There's gonna be some drama
around here.

19:26.664 --> 19:27.963
The missing keys

19:27.965 --> 19:29.298
Made me focus on the inmates,

19:29.300 --> 19:30.666
But I think it's a misdirection.

19:31.635 --> 19:33.702
I think I should be focusing
on the staff.

19:33.704 --> 19:36.939
Oh. I see.

19:36.941 --> 19:39.775
There will be some drama.

19:39.777 --> 19:41.510
But, wait, I'm staff.

19:41.512 --> 19:43.012
What if it's me?

19:43.014 --> 19:44.680
It's not you.
How can you tell?

19:44.682 --> 19:46.615
You're not the type.
Cop skills, huh?

19:46.617 --> 19:49.318
You can read people.

19:49.320 --> 19:51.754
Some people.

19:54.791 --> 19:57.193
A staff member?
That's absurd.

19:57.195 --> 19:59.528
It was an inmate.
I don't think so.

19:59.530 --> 20:01.530
Your job is to oversee
inmate security.

20:01.532 --> 20:03.732
You're not authorized to
conduct an investigation

20:03.734 --> 20:05.000
Of the staff.

20:05.002 --> 20:08.737
Whoa. You're trying
to force my hand.

20:08.739 --> 20:10.339
You want me to
call the police.

20:10.341 --> 20:12.341
No.

20:12.343 --> 20:15.277
I already called 'em.

20:29.660 --> 20:32.462
Barbara, you need to wake up.

20:34.665 --> 20:36.666
Morning.

20:36.668 --> 20:39.102
I got you coffee.

20:40.071 --> 20:42.505
Mmm, extra sweet.

20:42.507 --> 20:44.608
You always remember.

20:44.610 --> 20:46.109
Yeah.

20:46.111 --> 20:48.445
Have you spoken to jim recently?

20:48.447 --> 20:50.380
Why would I?

20:50.382 --> 20:51.781
Renee, you don't

20:51.783 --> 20:53.783
Have to be jealous of jim.

20:53.785 --> 20:55.986
I'm over him.

20:56.954 --> 20:59.522
This was a mistake.

20:59.524 --> 21:01.458
What was?

21:01.460 --> 21:03.560
This. Us.

21:03.562 --> 21:05.195
I should have never let it
go on for this long.

21:05.197 --> 21:07.697
I'm s... I'm sorry.

21:10.368 --> 21:12.369
Oh, I-I see.

21:12.371 --> 21:13.570
Look, barbara...

21:13.572 --> 21:16.139
No. No. I mean, you're...

21:16.141 --> 21:19.242
No, you are absolutely right.
This-this was a mistake.

21:19.244 --> 21:21.611
This has been a really
long process for me,

21:21.613 --> 21:24.281
And I've worked too hard
to get right with myself.

21:24.283 --> 21:28.318
I-I wanted this to be good,
but I can't fall back now.

21:28.320 --> 21:30.420
The drinking,
the drugs.

21:30.422 --> 21:32.289
We're toxic together,
you and me.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.757
Please, renee, stop.

21:33.759 --> 21:35.125
There's no need
to say another word.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.127
I am sorry that I interfered
with your process.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.428
Barbara,
you need help

21:38.430 --> 21:40.130
I can't give you right now.
Let me call jim

21:40.132 --> 21:41.765
For you, please.
No.

21:41.767 --> 21:44.668
Where's my purse?
You don't need
to go. Stay here.

21:44.670 --> 21:46.736
Take time to get yourself
together. I'll go.

21:46.738 --> 21:49.839
I am perfectly together,
thank you.

21:49.841 --> 21:51.841
I am just toxic, that's all.

21:51.843 --> 21:53.143
Now, where's my damn purse?!

21:53.145 --> 21:54.411
Barbara, stop.

21:54.413 --> 21:55.879
Calm down, please, all right?

21:57.481 --> 21:58.682
I'll go.

21:58.684 --> 21:59.816
Please.

21:59.818 --> 22:02.819
Fine.

22:02.821 --> 22:04.421
Do what you want. Go.

22:05.990 --> 22:07.023
I'm sorry...

22:07.025 --> 22:08.992
Just go.

22:30.314 --> 22:32.315
Hey, pal.

22:32.317 --> 22:34.684
In a cow slip's
bell I lie,

22:34.686 --> 22:38.121
There I crouch
when owls do cry.

22:38.123 --> 22:39.322
All right.

22:39.324 --> 22:40.523
I can dig that.

22:42.694 --> 22:43.694
Detective...

22:43.695 --> 22:45.528
Jim!

22:45.530 --> 22:47.530
Partner. Mwah!

22:47.532 --> 22:49.199
Let me take
a good look at you.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.401
Lord have
mercy, a screw.

22:51.403 --> 22:52.702
Excuse me.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:52.704 --> 22:53.737
Hey, you weren't exaggerating.

22:53.739 --> 22:56.740
Freaky as advertised.

22:56.742 --> 22:58.541
Nobody of authority
called on you, sir.

22:58.543 --> 22:59.909
This is not a police matter.

22:59.911 --> 23:01.711
You must be
director dr. Lang.

23:01.713 --> 23:03.313
See, I beg to differ.

23:03.315 --> 23:08.017
This is third degree assault,
at the very least.

23:08.019 --> 23:11.221
A friend of yours,
is it?

23:11.223 --> 23:13.022
Egregious insubordination.

23:13.024 --> 23:15.358
Your job here was already
hanging on a thread.

23:15.360 --> 23:17.560
This is the end of your career
in law enforcement.

23:17.562 --> 23:18.928
Count on it.
Whoa!

23:18.930 --> 23:20.663
Take it easy,
hot shot.

23:20.665 --> 23:21.831
Officer gordon did
the right thing.

23:21.833 --> 23:22.932
Why wouldn't he
call the police?

23:22.934 --> 23:24.000
Anyone would
think you'd want

23:24.002 --> 23:26.336
To keep
this business quiet.

23:26.338 --> 23:27.937
Gerry... It is
gerry, isn't it?

23:27.939 --> 23:30.840
Now, did you do
this terrible thing, gerry?

23:30.842 --> 23:33.977
That doesn't even
merit a reply.

23:35.045 --> 23:37.547
No, I did not do
this terrible thing.

23:37.549 --> 23:39.182
But you have the skill,
though, as a doctor.

23:39.184 --> 23:40.583
I mean, you could do
it, lickety-split.

23:40.585 --> 23:41.951
Now, why would I do this?

23:41.953 --> 23:42.786
Why would anyone?

23:42.788 --> 23:44.687
Exactly,
officer gordon.

23:44.689 --> 23:46.122
Gerry, I think we're
gonna have to take you

23:46.124 --> 23:47.891
Down to the precinct... you're
raising a lot of questions

23:47.893 --> 23:50.927
That need clearing up in
a more formal setting.

23:50.929 --> 23:52.695
Well, you can't
do this...
Sh-sh-sh-shush.

23:52.697 --> 23:56.566
As of this moment, this is an
official gcpd investigation.

23:56.568 --> 23:58.968
You, sir, will cooperate
or face arrest.

23:58.970 --> 24:02.639
Would you mind going through
the, uh, staff records

24:02.641 --> 24:04.774
While I take gerry, here,
downtown for a chat?

24:04.776 --> 24:05.842
Will do, detective.

24:08.877 --> 24:10.545
Sir?

24:11.548 --> 24:12.948
Jimmy.

24:12.950 --> 24:13.950
Butch.

24:16.319 --> 24:17.553
Good to see you.

24:17.555 --> 24:19.555
Come on.

24:22.760 --> 24:24.960
Like old times, huh?

24:24.962 --> 24:26.562
All we need is
a bottle of applejack.

24:27.731 --> 24:30.732
What happened, man?

24:30.734 --> 24:31.900
In my head, it's...

24:31.902 --> 24:34.937
We're still kids, chasing
girls in harlow park.

24:34.939 --> 24:35.939
Yeah.

24:35.940 --> 24:37.506
We caught a couple
of hot ones, huh?

24:37.508 --> 24:38.740
Especially me.

24:42.078 --> 24:45.180
Thanks for
meeting with me.

24:45.182 --> 24:47.516
What did you tell
your boss-lady?

24:47.518 --> 24:50.752
I suggested I reach out
to you. She agreed.

24:50.754 --> 24:53.956
Talk some
sense into me?

24:53.958 --> 24:56.258
It's a new dawn.

24:56.260 --> 24:57.693
Yeah, like that.

24:57.695 --> 25:00.028
She's not wrong, you know?

25:00.030 --> 25:02.464
City's changing.

25:02.466 --> 25:05.100
You really want falcone's job?

25:06.836 --> 25:08.871
Since we were kids, I
love you like a brother.

25:08.873 --> 25:10.539
I love you, too.

25:10.541 --> 25:11.940
Always. You know that.

25:11.942 --> 25:14.009
I do, I do.

25:14.011 --> 25:15.444
That's why
I trust you.

25:15.446 --> 25:17.346
And that's why I say
to you with love...

25:17.348 --> 25:19.214
Fish is doomed.

25:19.216 --> 25:22.050
There's no way she gets the
chair. It ain't gonna happen.

25:22.052 --> 25:23.552
She's a smart
cookie, but she's

25:23.554 --> 25:25.954
Overreaching. I mean,
come on, butch, without

25:25.956 --> 25:28.023
You and your crew,
what's she got?

25:28.025 --> 25:29.358
Very little.

25:29.360 --> 25:32.561
Everybody knows it. You know it.

25:32.563 --> 25:35.697
Maybe.

25:36.966 --> 25:39.301
What's it gonna take
to make you make a move?

25:39.303 --> 25:40.736
What are you offering?

25:40.738 --> 25:42.004
Name it.

25:42.006 --> 25:44.239
Drop fish, come over to us.

25:44.241 --> 25:48.076
The club... all the businesses
attached... they're yours.

25:48.078 --> 25:50.979
That's day one.
A welcome bonus.

25:50.981 --> 25:53.882
What else you want?

25:55.652 --> 25:58.654
That's a good question.

25:58.656 --> 26:00.055
Let me think it over.

26:00.057 --> 26:02.057
Yeah.

26:04.160 --> 26:05.827
Hey, brother.

26:07.664 --> 26:09.998
Don't think too long, huh?

26:21.044 --> 26:22.844
Detective bullock.

26:22.846 --> 26:25.213
Wait here.

26:25.215 --> 26:27.683
Penguin.

26:27.685 --> 26:29.017
It's good to see you.

26:29.019 --> 26:30.085
What are you guys doing?

26:30.087 --> 26:32.120
Old friend.

26:32.122 --> 26:33.889
Thank goodness you're here.

26:33.891 --> 26:35.257
There's been some silly mistake.

26:35.259 --> 26:36.592
Looks like it.

26:36.594 --> 26:38.360
Unless you irritated
someone important...

26:38.362 --> 26:39.795
You didn't do that, did you?

26:39.797 --> 26:40.929
Me?

26:40.931 --> 26:42.264
Of course not.

26:42.266 --> 26:43.932
You sure?

26:43.934 --> 26:46.234
Examine your soul, penguin.

26:46.236 --> 26:47.536
Wait!

26:47.538 --> 26:51.206
Don't go. Please, sir,
I-I beg of you.

26:52.809 --> 26:54.443
My patron, don maroni,
is obviously

26:54.445 --> 26:56.144
Unaware of my predicament.

26:57.146 --> 26:59.147
A simple phone call would

26:59.149 --> 27:01.550
Resolve things, I'm sure.

27:01.552 --> 27:04.486
But, see, I like
having you here.

27:04.488 --> 27:07.389
'cause I can sit at my desk

27:07.391 --> 27:09.157
And look at you.

27:09.159 --> 27:10.592
It's soothing.

27:10.594 --> 27:12.527
Like a bonsai tree.

27:18.635 --> 27:20.702
What's a
bonsai tree?

27:24.974 --> 27:27.409
♪ ♪

27:33.983 --> 27:35.183
So...

27:35.185 --> 27:37.786
Did you see our friend?

27:37.788 --> 27:39.021
I saw him.

27:39.023 --> 27:40.622
And?

27:40.624 --> 27:42.090
Eh.

27:42.092 --> 27:43.925
I'm working him.

27:43.927 --> 27:45.394
He's a stubborn cuss, that one.

27:46.996 --> 27:49.264
Just give him a little time.

27:50.266 --> 27:52.768
Time, hmm?

27:52.770 --> 27:54.369
Okay.

27:54.371 --> 27:55.771
He can have time.

27:56.773 --> 27:58.040
Yeah.

27:58.042 --> 28:00.776
I'm optimistic.

28:00.778 --> 28:01.943
Good.

28:10.117 --> 28:11.351
<i>All right, doctor,</i>

28:11.353 --> 28:12.852
Pretend I'm an ignoramus.

28:12.854 --> 28:14.854
Shouldn't be too hard, hmm?

28:14.856 --> 28:17.057
Explain to me this whole crazy
electric needle business.

28:17.059 --> 28:19.359
When a real doctor
like you does it,

28:19.361 --> 28:21.194
What's it supposed to do?

28:21.196 --> 28:23.863
Electroshock therapy
is a common procedure

28:23.865 --> 28:26.132
For mood and behavior
alteration.

28:26.134 --> 28:28.134
Like mind control?
Of a sort.

28:28.136 --> 28:30.136
Blue sky experimentation
on humans

28:30.138 --> 28:32.005
Is considered unethical,

28:32.007 --> 28:34.174
So we know very little
of the hard science.

28:34.176 --> 28:35.508
Okay.
But skilled

28:35.510 --> 28:38.912
Surgeons can elicit
very specific responses.

28:38.914 --> 28:40.580
Uh-huh.
But those inmates

28:40.582 --> 28:42.549
Weren't treated
by a skilled surgeon.

28:42.551 --> 28:44.350
You sure about that?
There are no

28:44.352 --> 28:46.219
Skilled surgeons
amongst the inmates.

28:46.221 --> 28:47.554
Or the staff.

28:47.556 --> 28:49.055
You're a skilled surgeon.

28:49.057 --> 28:51.825
What...
we've been over this.

28:51.827 --> 28:53.993
I haven't opened a body
since med school.

28:53.995 --> 28:56.162
I'm just messing with you.

28:56.164 --> 28:58.598
I don't think
you're the man behind this.

28:58.600 --> 29:00.767
No, you're not the
type to break rules.

29:00.769 --> 29:02.769
Too scared of authority.

29:02.771 --> 29:04.671
But you're hiding something.
What is it?

29:04.673 --> 29:06.239
Well, everybody's
hiding something.

29:06.241 --> 29:08.041
Don't play tag.

29:08.043 --> 29:10.376
You're right, detective.

29:10.378 --> 29:12.545
I am afraid of authority.

29:12.547 --> 29:13.947
And the things I'm hiding?

29:13.949 --> 29:15.081
I'll never tell you.

29:15.083 --> 29:16.883
Sounds heavy.
Heavy?

29:16.885 --> 29:18.718
Yes. And if you know
what's good for you,

29:18.720 --> 29:20.053
You won't dig any deeper.

29:20.055 --> 29:21.187
All right.

29:21.189 --> 29:23.590
I don't want to hit
any power lines.

29:23.592 --> 29:25.592
Don't have to
tell me twice.

29:25.594 --> 29:26.860
No digging. Unless, of course,

29:26.862 --> 29:29.129
It has something
to do with the case at hand.

29:29.131 --> 29:30.263
Nothing.

30:02.297 --> 30:06.133
Oh. Great, thank you.

30:08.236 --> 30:10.938
Oh, you poor thing.
You look so pale.

30:10.940 --> 30:12.306
Any joy?

30:12.308 --> 30:14.842
Not so far.

30:14.844 --> 30:16.510
The files seem to be incomplete.

30:17.846 --> 30:19.646
I'm wondering if there's
more in the basement.

30:20.682 --> 30:23.150
Blueprint says there's
a records office down there.

30:23.152 --> 30:26.120
Oh, the basement's closed off.

30:26.122 --> 30:28.289
Unsafe chemicals.

30:28.291 --> 30:29.924
Nobody's been down
there for ten years.

30:33.261 --> 30:35.329
Do you know the way down there?

30:40.201 --> 30:42.936
All right,
suppose you had to pick out

30:42.938 --> 30:45.171
One member of your staff
as the culprit.

30:45.173 --> 30:46.606
Who would it be?

30:46.608 --> 30:47.974
It wasn't a staff member.

30:47.976 --> 30:50.610
Whatever. Just the first face
that pops to your mind.

30:50.612 --> 30:51.845
Nobody.

30:51.847 --> 30:53.780
They're good people.
I know them well.

30:53.782 --> 30:56.216
They've all been with me
for more than five years.

30:56.218 --> 30:58.151
We all came to arkham together.

30:58.153 --> 31:00.220
Th...
Wait.

31:00.222 --> 31:02.889
Hold that. You just
saw someone. Who was it?

31:02.891 --> 31:04.724
Oh.
No, she couldn't..

31:04.726 --> 31:06.059
She?

31:06.061 --> 31:08.127
Who?

31:17.639 --> 31:19.839
What's that?

31:19.841 --> 31:22.475
Everybody's
in their cell.

31:23.477 --> 31:24.944
Dorothy.

31:26.046 --> 31:28.581
Jim, hi. What's up?

31:28.583 --> 31:30.450
Hi, leslie.

31:32.553 --> 31:34.387
We're going
on an adventure

31:34.389 --> 31:36.656
To the basement.

31:36.658 --> 31:38.324
Oh. Well, that
sounds fun.

31:39.426 --> 31:40.960
Can I come?
No.

31:43.197 --> 31:45.932
But...
Dr. Thompkins,
what did I tell you earlier?

31:45.934 --> 31:47.400
You should go home.

31:47.402 --> 31:48.768
Why? What's wrong?

31:48.770 --> 31:50.169
Nothing's wrong.

31:51.205 --> 31:53.039
Go home.

31:53.041 --> 31:54.440
I don't understa...

31:54.442 --> 31:56.009
Oh.
Whoa!

31:56.011 --> 31:57.377
You okay?

31:57.379 --> 32:00.380
I need you to find
the main entry guard,

32:00.382 --> 32:01.447
Tell him to
hit lockdown,

32:01.449 --> 32:03.416
Then get out of the
building, quick.
Okay,

32:03.418 --> 32:04.951
Hit lockdown.
Get out. Will do.

32:07.422 --> 32:08.755
- Yeah.
- Jim, listen,

32:08.757 --> 32:10.523
Dorothy duncan isn't staff.
She's an inmate.

32:10.525 --> 32:11.958
I know. Get over here now.

32:44.091 --> 32:45.959
Leslie!

33:22.863 --> 33:24.664
Guard!

33:24.666 --> 33:26.499
Guard! Help!

33:27.434 --> 33:28.968
Dr. Thompkins.

33:28.970 --> 33:30.503
Jim, behind you.

33:34.141 --> 33:35.975
Men!

33:35.977 --> 33:37.944
Men! What the hell

33:37.946 --> 33:39.779
Do you think you're playing at?!

33:39.781 --> 33:41.714
Go back in your cells

33:41.716 --> 33:43.282
Right now!

33:43.284 --> 33:44.650
You hear me?

33:44.652 --> 33:46.352
That's an order!

34:07.807 --> 34:11.708
Remember, I'm a vegan...
no butter.

34:11.710 --> 34:14.579
Yeah, yeah.

34:18.717 --> 34:20.018
Hi.

34:20.020 --> 34:22.520
Hi. I-is this...

34:22.522 --> 34:24.755
Is jim gordon there?

34:25.724 --> 34:27.190
Yes, he is.

34:27.193 --> 34:30.527
But I'm sorry,
jim is kind of busy right now.

34:32.165 --> 34:34.399
Can I take a message?

34:35.367 --> 34:36.734
No.

34:36.735 --> 34:39.337
No, that's okay.

34:39.339 --> 34:41.005
I...

34:41.007 --> 34:42.706
Who is this?

34:42.708 --> 34:44.876
I'm a friend of jim's.

34:44.878 --> 34:46.110
Who's that?

34:46.112 --> 34:48.679
Go to hell!

34:52.452 --> 34:54.719
M.E.'s got her
in the morgue.

34:54.721 --> 34:57.221
When dorothy duncan was a
16-year-old nursing student,

34:57.223 --> 34:59.624
She killed five kids
with poison candy...

34:59.626 --> 35:01.125
For homework, she said.

35:01.127 --> 35:03.561
She's spent over half
her life at arkham.

35:03.563 --> 35:05.096
When the asylum closed,
there was chaos.

35:05.098 --> 35:06.931
She must have just
hunkered down in the basement

35:06.933 --> 35:09.434
Until it reopened.
Forensics is sweeping
the basement level

35:09.436 --> 35:10.735
Looking for her lair.

35:10.737 --> 35:11.970
Poor soul.

35:11.972 --> 35:14.038
- What was she trying to do?
- Who knows?

35:14.040 --> 35:16.441
Maybe she was just
trying to find a cure
for her own madness.

35:16.443 --> 35:18.276
She was crazy.
Enough said.

35:18.278 --> 35:20.144
It's good
to see you, jim.

35:20.146 --> 35:22.080
And you got a win, huh?

35:22.082 --> 35:24.716
Still fightin'.
Nice work.

35:24.718 --> 35:26.784
Yeah, I don't think my boss
is gonna see it that way.

35:26.786 --> 35:29.087
He's working for the king
of all cheese grinders.

35:29.089 --> 35:32.056
It's a crying shame, cap...
we need to get him
back on the job.

35:32.058 --> 35:36.594
You know I'd bring you back here
in a second... If I could.

35:36.596 --> 35:37.829
I know.

35:37.831 --> 35:40.064
It's all good, captain.

35:40.066 --> 35:42.166
You do look spiffy
in the uniform.

35:42.168 --> 35:44.435
Yeah, if spiffy

35:44.437 --> 35:46.204
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

35:47.139 --> 35:49.807
How about a drink
for old times' sake?

35:49.809 --> 35:51.509
Sounds good.

35:53.346 --> 35:54.980
Penguin.

35:56.017 --> 35:58.584
Hi. Sir.

35:58.586 --> 36:01.020
Uh, don maroni.

36:01.022 --> 36:02.788
Thank heavens you're here.

36:02.790 --> 36:04.857
You look kind of frowsty.

36:04.859 --> 36:07.126
Uh... Forgive me.

36:07.128 --> 36:09.161
I've had nothing but
a moist towelette

36:09.163 --> 36:10.829
Since yesterday morning.

36:10.831 --> 36:13.198
A very sad picture.

36:13.200 --> 36:15.167
You know why you're in there?

36:15.169 --> 36:18.604
I have no idea.
A rhetorical
question.

36:18.606 --> 36:21.373
You're in there
because I put you in there.

36:21.375 --> 36:24.543
But, don maroni, wh-why?

36:24.545 --> 36:26.612
What did I do?

36:26.614 --> 36:28.947
Do you know what hubris is?

36:31.117 --> 36:31.817
Do you know?!

36:31.819 --> 36:33.318
Sorry.

36:33.320 --> 36:36.155
I-I thought that was another...

36:36.157 --> 36:37.389
Rhetorical...

36:37.391 --> 36:38.857
Question.

36:38.859 --> 36:41.193
Yes, I do.
H-hubris. It's when...

36:41.195 --> 36:42.728
It's when
limping little

36:42.730 --> 36:45.898
Chickenbutt second bananas
think they're hot stuff.

36:45.900 --> 36:48.167
Sir...
When dumbass underlings

36:48.169 --> 36:50.969
Raise taxes
without asking me first.

36:50.971 --> 36:53.138
Yes, sir.
On <i> fishermen.</i>

36:53.140 --> 36:55.974
You raised taxes on fishermen.

36:55.976 --> 36:58.310
They're out there
in the freakin' ocean

36:58.312 --> 37:00.345
Risking their lives
for us,

37:00.347 --> 37:03.649
And you raise their taxes
without asking me?

37:05.151 --> 37:08.053
That's hubris, my friend.

37:08.055 --> 37:10.089
I'm sorry, don maroni.

37:10.091 --> 37:13.092
Deeply... Sorry.

37:13.094 --> 37:15.961
I will never do it again.

37:19.099 --> 37:21.233
All right, then.

37:23.169 --> 37:25.237
Hey, you.

37:25.239 --> 37:27.239
Let my friends out.

37:27.241 --> 37:29.007
Excuse me?
What, am I

37:29.009 --> 37:31.276
Talking hungarian?
Open the cage, mook.

37:42.523 --> 37:45.190
Come here.

37:45.192 --> 37:47.526
Holy mother, you stink!

37:49.129 --> 37:51.563
Let this be a lesson
to you, yes?

37:51.565 --> 37:53.232
Yes, sir.

37:53.234 --> 37:55.701
You're
a smart monkey...

37:55.703 --> 37:58.036
But you're a monkey.

37:58.038 --> 38:00.139
And I'm the zookeeper.

38:03.743 --> 38:05.778
Yeah, you're all right.

38:12.718 --> 38:15.520
Captain, you should see this.

38:15.522 --> 38:16.721
Look here.

38:16.723 --> 38:19.691
Dorothy duncan.
Electrode wounds,

38:19.693 --> 38:20.759
Both sides.

38:20.761 --> 38:22.260
Same gauge as the
other victims.

38:22.262 --> 38:25.397
About a month old.
They were hidden
by her hair.

38:25.399 --> 38:27.265
This is crazy...
how could she have done this

38:27.267 --> 38:28.500
To herself?
She couldn't.

38:28.502 --> 38:29.868
Not humanly possible.

38:29.870 --> 38:31.770
Which means she
was just another victim.

38:31.772 --> 38:32.772
She couldn't.

38:32.773 --> 38:34.339
Aw, crap.

38:37.877 --> 38:39.778
Hey, aaron.

38:39.780 --> 38:41.646
What's up?

38:44.283 --> 38:45.717
Hey.

38:45.719 --> 38:46.851
Where'd you get those...

38:46.853 --> 38:48.319
Hey!

38:56.762 --> 38:59.964
Well done, aaron.

39:01.233 --> 39:03.735

39:03.737 --> 39:08.473
Oh, now you are my
best work so far.

39:08.475 --> 39:10.442

39:28.292 --> 39:29.559
Lang?

39:30.994 --> 39:32.795
Lang!
They're gone.

39:32.797 --> 39:34.197
Get an ambulance.

39:34.199 --> 39:36.466
- Go!
- Not...

39:36.468 --> 39:38.167
Staff.
Don't speak.

39:38.169 --> 39:39.736
Just breathe.

39:39.738 --> 39:42.138
Breathe!
Gr... Gruber.
