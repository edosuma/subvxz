01:38.780 --> 01:42.040
How long can
you hold your breath?

01:42.080 --> 01:45.710
I think I can hold mine
for about... 3 minutes,

01:45.750 --> 01:47.420
and that's without any tricks,

01:47.460 --> 01:50.710
no fancy breathing, no practice.

01:50.750 --> 01:52.840
I can hold my
breath while moving,

01:52.880 --> 01:55.260
which is very difficult.

01:55.300 --> 01:57.880
Most people have to
remain perfectly still,

01:57.930 --> 01:59.760
but I can do it anytime,

01:59.800 --> 02:02.890
under any circumstances.

02:04.100 --> 02:06.020
Maybe there's
something wrong with me.

02:06.060 --> 02:09.020
Maybe I have big lungs.

02:10.150 --> 02:12.110
No one has ever asked,

02:12.150 --> 02:16.150
and you're the first
person I've ever told.

02:16.650 --> 02:18.610
It's my only trick.

02:18.660 --> 02:19.950
It's never served any purpose

02:19.990 --> 02:21.620
in the outside world,

02:21.660 --> 02:26.000
but for me it's always useful.

02:26.580 --> 02:29.960
And the best thing
is it feels so good

02:30.000 --> 02:33.130
when you're done.

02:40.680 --> 02:43.810
What time is it?

02:43.850 --> 02:45.140
It's my husband and kid.

02:45.180 --> 02:47.100
Okay, you got to go!

02:47.140 --> 02:48.100
Get out!

02:48.140 --> 02:49.600
Augh!

02:54.440 --> 02:55.980
Don't get dressed, you idiot!

02:56.030 --> 02:58.280
Get out!

02:58.320 --> 03:00.150
Nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh, no.

03:09.370 --> 03:11.830
And there it is,

03:11.870 --> 03:15.840
another satisfying,
fulfilling day.

03:15.880 --> 03:18.260
Mom, I'm home!

03:18.300 --> 03:20.340
Fuck me.

03:33.520 --> 03:36.440
How quickly things can change.

03:37.400 --> 03:40.450
One instant you think
you've got your bearings,

03:40.490 --> 03:42.950
you know where everything is,

03:42.990 --> 03:47.160
and not just just talking about
your emotional bearings,

03:47.200 --> 03:51.040
I'm talking about where
you're at on the map.

04:13.810 --> 04:17.230
Take for instance our recent
family trip to Spain.

04:17.269 --> 04:19.070
I looked at the
map a single time,

04:19.110 --> 04:21.320
and then just followed my gut.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.540
But these things are deceptive.

04:34.580 --> 04:36.920
Your instincts might change
and leave you wondering

04:36.960 --> 04:39.590
if you ever knew
anything at all.

04:45.130 --> 04:46.590
And it's really hard
to stay sharp

04:46.640 --> 04:49.560
at anything when
you're stuck at home.

04:49.600 --> 04:52.680
Mom!

05:00.020 --> 05:02.280
Come on, Mom, hurry up.

05:05.280 --> 05:06.788
Back the other way.
Get the ball, guys,

05:06.820 --> 05:08.280
keep it going, keep it going.

05:08.320 --> 05:10.080
All right, come on, go get it.

05:10.120 --> 05:13.290
Of all the horrors a young
mother must endure,

05:13.330 --> 05:18.130
kids soccer practice
must surely be the worst.

05:18.170 --> 05:20.960
But like everything,

05:21.000 --> 05:23.460
there's nothing
really to complain about

05:23.510 --> 05:25.300
because there's
nothing really going on.

05:25.340 --> 05:26.590
Over this way.

05:26.630 --> 05:27.930
Over this way, guys.

05:27.970 --> 05:29.760
Guys, bring it back this way.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.640
Over here.

05:34.640 --> 05:36.140
There you go.

05:41.190 --> 05:43.480
And the only thing worse
than sports for kids

05:43.530 --> 05:45.900
is sports for adults,

05:45.950 --> 05:49.240
like when your
husband is the coach.

05:52.200 --> 05:53.490
That's right, fuck head,

05:53.540 --> 05:55.960
you know I'm up to
something, don't you?

05:56.000 --> 05:58.460
You're just not
quite sure what it is yet.

05:58.500 --> 06:00.000
Move the ball, move the ball.

06:00.040 --> 06:03.340
I'm about to make
a big life change here.

06:03.380 --> 06:04.840
I know it's early in my life

06:04.880 --> 06:07.930
and the story for
such a brash move,

06:07.970 --> 06:09.590
but what the hell.

06:09.640 --> 06:11.010
Come on, Blake!

06:11.050 --> 06:13.260
You're fuckin' doing it!

06:13.310 --> 06:16.140
See that bitch over there?

06:16.180 --> 06:18.520
Knock it down, knock it down!

06:18.560 --> 06:20.520
That is Janice Jeworski.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.520
This way! You're
going the wrong way!

06:22.570 --> 06:24.940
She leaves her keys
in her van every week

06:24.980 --> 06:26.690
because she's a dolt.

06:26.740 --> 06:29.610
Who is that?
Is that on your team?

06:29.660 --> 06:32.580
I'm about to
take advantage of that.

06:35.080 --> 06:37.460
Get the ball, sweetie.

06:37.500 --> 06:39.000
Come on!

06:39.040 --> 06:40.710
Let's go, pick it up!

06:40.750 --> 06:42.380
Woo!

06:42.420 --> 06:44.170
This way.

06:48.760 --> 06:50.550
I'm not the best mother,

06:50.590 --> 06:53.680
I'm willing to admit that much,

06:54.180 --> 06:56.020
but life is short,

06:56.060 --> 06:59.060
and I've got a
lot of shit to do.

07:03.770 --> 07:06.900
I just need to get away
from all this right now.

07:06.940 --> 07:08.900
I'll bring Janice's van back,

07:08.950 --> 07:12.410
some day... maybe.

07:16.620 --> 07:17.910
Come on, George, let's go buddy.

07:25.170 --> 07:26.210
I gotta admit

07:26.250 --> 07:27.210
It's not the first time

07:27.260 --> 07:28.920
I've done something like this,

07:28.970 --> 07:32.300
but I'm going to
make this one the best.

07:33.550 --> 07:37.930
Now if only I had someone
to share my joy with.

07:59.500 --> 08:01.040
Although he hasn't called,

08:01.080 --> 08:02.920
there's a good
chance that by now,

08:02.960 --> 08:04.630
after only an hour,

08:04.670 --> 08:08.250
Aaron has already
cancelled my credit card.

08:08.300 --> 08:09.800
I knew this moment was coming,

08:09.840 --> 08:13.090
and I'm prepared for at
least a couple of days.

08:13.130 --> 08:15.930
But will a couple
of days do the trick?

08:34.360 --> 08:37.990
Never swim alone.

08:38.030 --> 08:39.620
It's too freakin' dangerous

08:39.659 --> 08:42.000
and God knows what
will happen to you,

08:42.039 --> 08:44.960
there's lots of ass
rape-y fish out there.

08:46.710 --> 08:48.670
See, the problem is

08:48.710 --> 08:51.340
you might not know
how deep the water is

08:51.380 --> 08:54.300
or where the big drop off is.

08:54.340 --> 08:55.840
And who knows what will happen

08:55.890 --> 08:58.930
when you reach the big drop off.

08:58.970 --> 09:04.310
You might have to think
for yourself for a second.

09:04.350 --> 09:05.980
So part of you,

09:06.020 --> 09:08.860
just a tiny part in
the back of your mind,

09:08.900 --> 09:12.990
starts looking for
the big drop off,

09:13.570 --> 09:14.990
but there's no sign of it,

09:15.030 --> 09:18.490
and swimming is
so damn refreshing

09:18.530 --> 09:20.950
you begin to forget
all those warnings

09:20.990 --> 09:23.790
about the drop off.

09:24.870 --> 09:27.120
And then, you start to wonder

09:27.170 --> 09:28.880
if there is a drop off.

09:28.920 --> 09:31.960
Like, how far am I
gonna have to walk

09:32.000 --> 09:35.470
before I can't touch
the bottom anymore?

09:38.930 --> 09:41.310
And what if you're right?

09:41.350 --> 09:43.390
Maybe there just
never is any point

09:43.430 --> 09:46.770
where you reach
the big drop off.

09:47.440 --> 09:51.070
What then?

10:54.670 --> 10:59.300
What's so special about you?

10:59.340 --> 11:02.390
Why does there have
to be anything special?

11:02.430 --> 11:06.060
Got anymore of those cigarettes?

11:06.100 --> 11:07.980
Half a pack.

11:08.020 --> 11:09.480
That's special.

11:09.520 --> 11:11.270
If you say so.

11:11.310 --> 11:15.320
Get in.

11:15.360 --> 11:16.480
Why should I?

11:16.530 --> 11:20.150
You tell me,
you're the hitchhiker.

11:26.870 --> 11:29.500
What's so special about you?

11:29.540 --> 11:34.250
Just get in.

11:34.290 --> 11:35.920
No.

11:35.960 --> 11:37.170
No?

11:37.210 --> 11:38.460
No.
Are you serious?

11:38.510 --> 11:42.680
I'm serious, I'm not getting in.

11:42.720 --> 11:45.180
Oh, come on.

11:49.480 --> 11:51.190
All right, all right,
I will tell you,

11:51.230 --> 11:52.270
just get in!

11:52.310 --> 11:53.850
Nope.

11:59.490 --> 12:01.030
Asshole, get in the car!

12:01.070 --> 12:02.990
No way.

12:03.030 --> 12:05.870
Damn it.

12:05.910 --> 12:07.660
The van is stolen.

12:07.700 --> 12:08.700
I've abandoned my family

12:08.740 --> 12:09.886
and I plan on drinking myself

12:09.910 --> 12:12.670
into a coma tonight.

12:21.760 --> 12:28.350
You see... you are special.

13:11.470 --> 13:14.390
On the very top of the long list

13:14.440 --> 13:17.100
of things a parent
is now forbidden to do

13:17.150 --> 13:20.020
with her child are two things.

13:20.650 --> 13:23.030
The first is called screen time,

13:23.070 --> 13:24.780
which used to be
called television,

13:24.820 --> 13:27.200
but now encompasses everything,

13:27.240 --> 13:30.330
including phones and tablets,

13:31.660 --> 13:35.410
The second thing is
smoking, of course.

13:39.340 --> 13:41.460
You can yell at your kids,

13:41.500 --> 13:42.960
pressure them into feelings

13:43.010 --> 13:45.800
of constant inadequacy.

13:45.840 --> 13:47.430
Hell, even the odd spank

13:47.470 --> 13:49.720
seems to be acceptable now.

13:51.100 --> 13:54.140
But since we all know
it's impossible to parent

13:54.180 --> 13:58.270
without the babysitting
assistance of an iPad,

13:58.310 --> 14:03.480
you better, not, ever, smoke.

14:03.530 --> 14:06.780
♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. ♪

14:09.030 --> 14:12.490
And we're not talking about
an illegal substance,

14:12.530 --> 14:16.250
just good
old-fashioned tobacco,

14:16.290 --> 14:17.960
the stuff that's
built economies,

14:18.000 --> 14:19.250
enslaved races

14:19.290 --> 14:23.500
and spawned great
conversations forever,

14:23.550 --> 14:27.170
but whatever.

16:19.540 --> 16:21.870
Fuck!

16:39.680 --> 16:41.770
Hello.

16:41.810 --> 16:44.060
Claire, listen.

16:44.100 --> 16:45.980
I'm okay, Aaron.

16:46.020 --> 16:48.900
I am sorry.

16:48.940 --> 16:50.980
I just, I needed to
get away for a bit.

16:51.030 --> 16:57.660
Claire, Claire just,
look, I don't care.

16:57.700 --> 17:00.490
Okay.

17:00.540 --> 17:05.329
I said it a
thousand times before...

17:05.369 --> 17:09.170
it doesn't matter.

17:09.210 --> 17:11.260
I'm sorry, Aaron, I'm stuck
a motel out of town.

17:11.300 --> 17:12.510
I need you to come pick me up.

17:12.550 --> 17:14.170
I'll stop you right there.

17:14.220 --> 17:17.140
There's somebody here that
wants to say something to you.

17:17.180 --> 17:23.599
Are you sure?

17:23.640 --> 17:24.599
Mom.

17:24.640 --> 17:26.440
Hi sweetheart.

17:30.690 --> 17:33.820
Don't come back here.

17:33.860 --> 17:36.030
Baby, no.

17:36.070 --> 17:42.870
No, I don't want
this anymore... no more.

17:42.910 --> 17:45.370
Don't you wish we could just
see each other right now?

17:45.410 --> 17:46.830
No.

17:46.870 --> 17:49.380
Please, stay away.

17:49.420 --> 17:50.540
You don't mean that.

17:50.590 --> 17:52.960
Yes, I do.

17:53.010 --> 17:54.236
Listen, George, I am your mother

17:54.260 --> 17:56.550
and you don't get
to choose your mother.

17:56.590 --> 17:59.550
So you tell your father
to come and pick me up.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.140
He doesn't want to
talk to you anymore.

18:01.180 --> 18:03.560
And anyway, this is my idea.

18:03.600 --> 18:06.020
No, it is not your idea.

18:06.060 --> 18:07.850
Is to.

18:07.900 --> 18:08.900
Goddamn it, George,

18:08.940 --> 18:11.730
this is not open for debate.

18:11.770 --> 18:14.230
It's not nice to yell.

18:14.280 --> 18:15.740
Well then listen,

18:15.780 --> 18:20.320
tell your father to
come and pick me up!

18:20.370 --> 18:22.990
I thought about this a lot.

18:23.040 --> 18:25.910
When, in the last few hours?

18:25.950 --> 18:27.000
In my life.

18:27.040 --> 18:28.420
You are just a kid.

18:28.460 --> 18:29.580
I'm your kid.

18:29.630 --> 18:32.250
And that is why you
need to listen to me!

18:32.290 --> 18:35.170
Mommy needs time out.

18:35.210 --> 18:39.590
That is enough,
George, that is ENOUGH!

18:39.640 --> 18:41.260
I'm sorry, Mom,

18:41.300 --> 18:44.600
I'm really, really sorry.

18:51.980 --> 18:56.900
Then let's just forget
about this, okay?

18:56.940 --> 18:57.950
Bye Mom.

18:57.990 --> 18:59.780
No!

18:59.820 --> 19:01.410
Fuck!

19:09.000 --> 19:13.130
What are you looking at?

19:20.590 --> 19:25.310
Worst. Mommy. Ever.

20:53.190 --> 20:54.900
Where are you going?

20:54.940 --> 20:57.190
This way.

20:57.230 --> 20:59.690
You don't know
where you're going?

20:59.730 --> 21:02.740
Why do I have to know?

21:02.780 --> 21:04.570
Fair enough.

21:04.610 --> 21:06.160
I'm only going a couple of miles

21:06.200 --> 21:10.660
down the road to my work,
can't take you any farther.

21:10.700 --> 21:12.160
Sounds good.

21:12.200 --> 21:16.880
All right, get in.

21:29.680 --> 21:31.260
You can continue
walking from my work,

21:31.310 --> 21:33.520
but there's not a
lot of highway left.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.770
This is the end of the road?

21:35.810 --> 21:37.400
Almost.

21:37.440 --> 21:39.110
I live a little
beyond this, but,

21:39.150 --> 21:41.360
this is pretty much it.

21:41.730 --> 21:44.110
What's your work?

21:44.150 --> 21:46.200
I'm a dancer in the bar up here.

21:46.240 --> 21:49.740
They open early and I
have the first shift.

21:50.830 --> 21:53.790
Never been so far
down this highway.

21:53.830 --> 21:55.750
Well you don't know
what you're missing.

21:55.790 --> 21:57.960
Here?
You're kidding.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.040
I wish I was.

22:02.050 --> 22:04.420
What kind of dancer are you?

22:04.460 --> 22:06.380
The kind that dances in bars.

22:06.430 --> 22:08.090
So not the fancy kind.

22:08.140 --> 22:11.100
Not so much.

22:43.550 --> 22:48.510
Well, uh, nice knowing ya.

22:48.550 --> 22:51.470
Yeah.

22:54.430 --> 22:57.560
Good luck with the trip.

25:15.410 --> 25:17.870
Why'd you stay?

25:19.370 --> 25:21.080
I don't know.

25:21.120 --> 25:23.200
Don't know much, do ya?

25:24.290 --> 25:26.370
Not lately, no.

25:28.040 --> 25:30.750
Well, you've had a
chance to look around,

25:30.800 --> 25:34.510
so why don't you be on your way?

25:34.550 --> 25:36.510
I want to see more.

25:36.550 --> 25:39.760
Look, I don't know
what your deal is,

25:39.800 --> 25:43.020
but there is nothing
here for you, trust me.

25:43.060 --> 25:44.326
So, why don't you
head down the highway

25:44.350 --> 25:48.020
back in the direction you came?

25:48.060 --> 25:50.440
I can't.

25:50.480 --> 25:52.860
But you can't stay here.

25:52.900 --> 25:54.296
Brandy and I are
all alone out there.

25:54.320 --> 25:55.780
I got to get on the floor.

25:55.820 --> 25:58.660
Hey, stranger, Lila
wants to talk to you.

25:58.700 --> 26:01.160
Who me?

26:01.200 --> 26:02.990
Who's Lila?

26:06.250 --> 26:08.830
Should have left
when you had a chance.

26:08.880 --> 26:10.380
Come on.

26:10.420 --> 26:11.420
I'll show you.

26:19.430 --> 26:21.300
Welcome, have a seat.

26:30.770 --> 26:31.900
Jenny, who's your friend?

26:31.940 --> 26:32.980
She's not my friend.

26:33.020 --> 26:35.190
Who's your stranger?

26:36.440 --> 26:38.820
I have no idea.

26:38.860 --> 26:40.386
Picked her up hitchhiking
on the highway,

26:40.410 --> 26:43.580
and she followed me in here.

26:43.620 --> 26:45.410
You often pick up hitchhikers?

26:45.450 --> 26:47.460
Unfortunately yes.

26:49.460 --> 26:50.830
What's your name?

26:50.880 --> 26:52.960
Claire.

26:54.550 --> 26:57.130
What are you doing in my bar?

26:58.550 --> 27:01.140
I'm not sure yet.

27:02.180 --> 27:03.220
You want a job?

27:03.260 --> 27:04.510
Here we go.

27:04.560 --> 27:05.680
Shut up!

27:05.720 --> 27:08.020
Janelle quit last night.

27:08.060 --> 27:09.230
Of course she did.

27:09.270 --> 27:11.400
You from around here?
What's your story?

27:11.440 --> 27:13.570
No story, just passing through.

27:14.360 --> 27:18.070
Can you pour drinks and
take off your clothes?

27:18.110 --> 27:20.410
As a matter of fact,

27:20.450 --> 27:21.636
those are the two exact things

27:21.660 --> 27:24.700
I've dedicated my life to most.

27:24.740 --> 27:25.950
Good.

27:25.990 --> 27:27.790
Don't drink my booze,

27:27.830 --> 27:29.790
at least not as
much as this one does.

27:29.830 --> 27:30.790
Please.

27:30.830 --> 27:32.130
Got a place to stay?

27:32.170 --> 27:34.210
I stayed a motel down
the highway last night,

27:34.250 --> 27:36.170
but I don't want
to go back there.

27:36.380 --> 27:38.880
Stay with Jenny.

27:38.920 --> 27:40.220
What the fuck?

27:40.260 --> 27:42.720
Would that be okay?

27:42.760 --> 27:44.930
No, it wouldn't.

27:44.970 --> 27:46.310
It'll be fine.

27:46.350 --> 27:48.430
I actually own her house
and she rents it from me,

27:48.480 --> 27:49.600
she has to do what I say.

27:49.640 --> 27:50.600
I do not.

27:50.640 --> 27:51.940
Check your lease, you do.

27:51.980 --> 27:53.770
Wow.

27:53.810 --> 27:54.900
Thanks.

27:54.940 --> 27:55.900
You can start tomorrow.

27:55.940 --> 27:57.320
The two of you can carpool.

27:57.360 --> 27:59.990
Works for me.

28:00.030 --> 28:02.570
Fuck you both very much.

28:02.950 --> 28:03.990
FUCK this!

28:04.030 --> 28:05.490
Why does shit always
happen to me?!

28:05.530 --> 28:07.160
I really don't
think it'll be that bad.

28:07.200 --> 28:08.330
What the hell?

28:08.370 --> 28:10.580
I do one good deed,
by picking you up,

28:10.620 --> 28:12.330
and now I can't get rid of you.

28:12.370 --> 28:13.330
How is that karma?

28:13.370 --> 28:14.630
I just might grow on you.

28:14.670 --> 28:16.106
It's a small house in
the middle of nowhere

28:16.130 --> 28:18.000
and there's not
enough room for you.

28:18.050 --> 28:19.760
I won't take up much space.

28:19.800 --> 28:21.340
And who are you, anyways, hmm?

28:21.380 --> 28:23.340
Walking down the highway
with your fancy purse

28:23.380 --> 28:25.850
like some misplaced
fuckin' soccer mom,

28:25.890 --> 28:27.350
is that it?

28:27.390 --> 28:29.560
Do you need directions back
to your soccer practice?

28:34.900 --> 28:36.440
I'm sorry, okay.

28:36.480 --> 28:37.690
But come on,

28:37.730 --> 28:39.376
that's some crazy shit
that goes on in there.

28:39.400 --> 28:41.990
You can't blame me
for being curious.

28:42.030 --> 28:45.160
Be curious, that's fine,
but don't ruin my life.

28:45.200 --> 28:46.530
Give me a break, okay.

28:46.570 --> 28:47.990
I had a really shitty morning

28:48.030 --> 28:49.056
and this is the first good thing

28:49.080 --> 28:50.950
that's happened to me.

28:51.580 --> 28:57.170
Actually, you
turned my day around.

28:58.170 --> 29:02.590
Well then, you're welcome.

31:13.550 --> 31:19.190
Those pictures over
there, your family?

31:19.230 --> 31:22.190
Former family.

31:22.230 --> 31:25.570
Know all about that,
do you soccer mom?

31:27.240 --> 31:29.110
Not sure yet.

31:29.150 --> 31:32.490
Yeah, you are, you got the boot.

31:32.530 --> 31:34.660
I saw your walk of shame
a mile down the highway

31:34.700 --> 31:37.700
before I came and picked you up.

31:37.750 --> 31:40.210
Is that why you stopped?

31:40.250 --> 31:43.330
See where that got me?

31:43.380 --> 31:45.040
Smart.

31:45.090 --> 31:47.380
I'm not all bad.

31:47.420 --> 31:49.220
I suspect if I were
to ask your husband

31:49.260 --> 31:51.510
he may say something
a little bit different.

31:51.550 --> 31:54.220
He is not the problem.

31:54.260 --> 31:58.220
Who then?

31:58.270 --> 32:00.810
My 7-year-old son.

32:07.320 --> 32:09.400
Got abandoned by your own child?

32:09.440 --> 32:10.860
He's a sweet kid.

32:10.900 --> 32:13.990
He probably didn't
sleep last night.

32:14.030 --> 32:16.870
He'll get over it.

32:16.910 --> 32:20.500
Sure about that?

32:20.540 --> 32:22.870
No.

32:23.540 --> 32:25.380
And you take orders
from a 7-year-old?

32:25.420 --> 32:27.250
This time I do.
Why?

32:27.300 --> 32:31.880
Because I agree with him.

32:31.920 --> 32:35.140
Got a photo?

32:36.300 --> 32:39.180
What about on your phone?

32:39.220 --> 32:42.350
I've never used
the camera before.

32:46.150 --> 32:47.730
Where are you going?

32:47.770 --> 32:49.993
This day and age, you don't
have a picture on your phone?

33:06.330 --> 33:07.920
Please tell me this
is not the only photo

33:07.960 --> 33:10.760
you have of your son.

33:12.670 --> 33:16.340
Wow.

33:16.840 --> 33:20.310
Look, he's got a
little mustache, cute.

33:20.350 --> 33:21.930
I see and that's
artistic license

33:21.970 --> 33:25.270
and that your son doesn't
actually have a mustache.

33:27.020 --> 33:30.480
What's his name?

33:30.530 --> 33:34.240
George.

33:34.280 --> 33:36.990
Surprisingly heavy.

33:37.030 --> 33:39.870
You got that right.

33:55.170 --> 33:57.340
So there we were,

33:57.390 --> 34:00.850
at least maybe now she
was warming up to me.

34:00.890 --> 34:03.020
I wanted to ask her more
about all the people

34:03.060 --> 34:04.770
in the pictures with her.

34:04.810 --> 34:06.980
There were so many of them,

34:07.020 --> 34:09.690
and I'll bet there's
a good story behind them.

34:09.730 --> 34:13.440
Maybe even more
depressing than mine.

34:13.480 --> 34:15.860
Maybe I was just tired,
or hadn't eaten,

34:15.900 --> 34:18.820
or maybe not enough to drink,

34:18.870 --> 34:20.620
but my mind kept flashing back

34:20.659 --> 34:24.040
to the origins of George,

34:24.080 --> 34:27.540
not George the boy, this George.

34:27.580 --> 34:31.130
The rock has a story.

34:33.250 --> 34:36.670
It was about a year ago,

34:36.719 --> 34:39.139
George, the boy,
was around 6 1/2,

34:39.179 --> 34:41.219
we'd taken a
family vacation trip

34:41.260 --> 34:44.219
to somewhere I'd always
wanted to go, Menorca,

34:44.270 --> 34:45.520
which is an island,

34:45.560 --> 34:48.350
but technically
it's part of Spain.

34:50.400 --> 34:52.320
On this one particular beach,

34:52.360 --> 34:54.230
George had found this rock,

34:54.280 --> 34:57.400
and insisted on keeping
it and bringing it home.

34:57.450 --> 34:58.740
He drew all the features

34:58.780 --> 35:02.200
and he named it
George after himself.

35:02.240 --> 35:03.740
But when we got home,

35:03.780 --> 35:06.540
little George was struck
with the realization

35:06.580 --> 35:08.080
he'd stolen something

35:08.120 --> 35:11.710
and he immediately asked
us to bring it back.

35:11.750 --> 35:13.590
It really bothered him.

35:13.630 --> 35:15.340
One of those baffling things

35:15.380 --> 35:19.680
that kids just latch onto
for whatever reason.

35:20.300 --> 35:23.760
Actually, we probably
should have just hid it.

35:23.800 --> 35:25.930
I don't know what it was.

35:25.970 --> 35:28.520
His first experience of guilt?

35:28.560 --> 35:30.230
His first realization
that he upset

35:30.270 --> 35:34.400
some sort of balance
in the universe?

35:34.440 --> 35:38.070
I guess that's a
hard thing for anybody.

35:58.670 --> 36:01.800
Why didn't you just
mail the rock back?

36:01.840 --> 36:03.470
It wasn't enough.

36:03.510 --> 36:06.510
He needed to go to the
exact spot he found it.

36:08.680 --> 36:09.930
So lie.

36:09.980 --> 36:11.116
Tell him that you
promise to mail it back

36:11.140 --> 36:12.810
to some Piala farmer in Menorca

36:12.850 --> 36:14.086
and that he promised
to bring it back

36:14.110 --> 36:16.820
exactly where you found it.

36:16.860 --> 36:20.900
That wouldn't be right.

36:23.200 --> 36:24.820
And stealing a car,
banging a hitchhiker

36:24.870 --> 36:26.136
and then getting
a job as a stripper

36:26.160 --> 36:29.580
is morally acceptable to you?

36:29.620 --> 36:35.330
Yes.

36:48.640 --> 36:51.680
And so began
my career in the uh...,

36:51.730 --> 36:53.600
"service industry".

36:53.640 --> 36:55.270
And let me tell you,

36:55.310 --> 36:59.440
it was better than I
could have ever imagined.

37:05.070 --> 37:06.700
I started with just
the waitressing part,

37:06.740 --> 37:07.830
but I was anxious

37:07.870 --> 37:10.870
to get to the
exotic dancering part.

37:10.910 --> 37:12.226
All the other girls
worked the barn dance,

37:12.250 --> 37:14.370
but no one was as good as Jenny.

37:14.420 --> 37:15.880
Something about
the way she did it

37:15.920 --> 37:17.960
was just a little better,

37:18.000 --> 37:20.170
even the old
fucker seemed to see it.

37:20.210 --> 37:22.970
So, I started studying Jenny.

37:23.010 --> 37:24.526
What the hell, she
hadn't train or anything

37:24.550 --> 37:26.390
and was doing fine.

37:26.430 --> 37:29.470
I wanted to do that, too.

37:29.510 --> 37:31.560
And it was never the same,

37:31.600 --> 37:33.730
she gave them a
new show every time

37:33.770 --> 37:36.230
and gave everybody
special attention.

37:36.270 --> 37:38.650
Hell, it wasn't hard
to keep track of them.

37:38.690 --> 37:42.570
They all sat in basically
the same place every time,

37:42.610 --> 37:44.400
they even ordered
the same drinks.

37:44.450 --> 37:47.570
In fact, they didn't
even really order.

37:47.620 --> 37:49.580
Brandy told me early
on what everyone liked

37:49.620 --> 37:51.580
and I just remembered it.

37:51.620 --> 37:54.540
They seemed happy with that.

38:00.540 --> 38:02.090
And then there was the money,

38:02.130 --> 38:04.380
not a lot... but some.

38:04.420 --> 38:06.930
I don't know where the
geezers got their cash,

38:06.970 --> 38:10.680
but they were there
all the time spending it,

38:10.720 --> 38:12.520
Lila was happy to take it.

38:12.560 --> 38:14.270
Every day, twice a day

38:14.310 --> 38:15.616
she'd take the
cash out of the till

38:15.640 --> 38:18.100
and move it into the
safe in her back office.

38:18.150 --> 38:20.190
There was really no
record of any of it.

38:20.230 --> 38:22.270
I guess she was
keeping books somewhere,

38:22.320 --> 38:24.110
I just never saw it.

38:36.410 --> 38:40.460
Through it all,
Jenny was dancing.

38:40.500 --> 38:42.130
Technically she
called it stripping,

38:42.170 --> 38:45.920
but for me it was something
more akin to sÃ©ance.

38:57.850 --> 39:00.480
Whatever the case, it
pleased the old men,

39:00.520 --> 39:03.900
who kept standing up every
time she went out there,

39:03.940 --> 39:05.480
like they were all
getting up to piss

39:05.530 --> 39:07.400
but never went to the bathroom,

39:07.450 --> 39:11.200
and just sat down
after she was done.

39:12.370 --> 39:18.120
Yeah, from all appearances
it was a strange place.

39:18.160 --> 39:21.960
But for me, it
all sorta made sense.

40:41.160 --> 40:43.290
Buenos dias.

40:49.420 --> 40:52.930
You see, you are special.

40:55.930 --> 40:57.050
What do you do?

40:57.100 --> 40:58.100
It's not important.

40:58.140 --> 41:00.020
You're fucking up,
you're fucking up!

41:00.060 --> 41:01.930
People are busy
with real things.

41:01.980 --> 41:03.020
I have everything,

41:03.060 --> 41:04.206
everything that a
person could want.

41:04.230 --> 41:06.020
I mean, I get it.

41:06.060 --> 41:07.980
Who cares what other
things I might want?

41:40.680 --> 41:44.230
How much cash do you think
Lila pulls in, in a week?

41:44.270 --> 41:46.480
Why, you want to rob her?

41:46.520 --> 41:47.770
I'm in.

41:47.810 --> 41:50.900
No, I'm just thinking out loud.

41:50.940 --> 41:53.820
Not much. You'll see
when she pays you.

41:53.860 --> 41:55.110
But it's something, right?

41:55.150 --> 41:56.660
Something.

41:56.700 --> 41:58.700
Something's all I need.

42:02.700 --> 42:04.540
I don't get you.

42:06.210 --> 42:08.170
I saved you from your shame,

42:08.210 --> 42:10.500
you got a job and a free
place to stay, now what?

42:10.540 --> 42:12.090
I need to get
back to that beach.

42:12.130 --> 42:13.090
Please.

42:13.130 --> 42:14.340
This is important.

42:14.380 --> 42:16.010
To return the rock to the beach?

42:16.050 --> 42:18.260
It's not like it'd
even be that much.

42:18.300 --> 42:20.550
Granted, it is tourist season.

42:21.560 --> 42:22.850
This level of
self-indulgence

42:22.890 --> 42:24.680
is what got you in trouble
in the first place.

42:24.730 --> 42:25.980
It's not for me, it's for him.

42:26.020 --> 42:27.600
Liar.

42:27.650 --> 42:29.360
He's 7.

42:29.400 --> 42:32.020
He has no clue
how far away it is,

42:32.070 --> 42:34.490
even appreciates how much
a plane ticket costs.

42:34.530 --> 42:36.900
That is exactly
why I need to do it.

42:38.410 --> 42:39.870
No.

42:39.910 --> 42:41.490
I want a cookie.

42:41.530 --> 42:43.450
You can't have a cookie.

42:43.490 --> 42:46.040
I made the cookies.

42:46.080 --> 42:48.460
This will fail.

42:48.500 --> 42:50.670
You will fail.

42:50.710 --> 42:52.210
This won't make him love you,

42:52.250 --> 42:57.380
or miss you, or want you back.

42:57.420 --> 43:00.970
I'm find with the odds.

43:02.100 --> 43:03.220
Well, there's only one way

43:03.260 --> 43:05.850
to make the money
you need to get there.

43:08.230 --> 43:09.576
You need tips
from the old fuckers.

43:09.600 --> 43:11.400
Oh, their tips are terrible.

43:11.440 --> 43:13.480
Their bar tips are terrible,

43:13.520 --> 43:16.190
their dancing
tips are reasonable,

43:16.240 --> 43:17.990
actually more than reasonable.

43:18.030 --> 43:19.546
I don't know where
those limp dick fuckers

43:19.570 --> 43:22.370
get all their money, but
you got to do it right.

43:22.410 --> 43:25.290
Yeah, but they only like you.

43:26.620 --> 43:28.540
What's your secret?

43:28.580 --> 43:31.540
Maybe I'm just gifted.

43:50.560 --> 43:53.060
Where do all these
old fuckers come from?

43:53.110 --> 43:54.230
The real magical question

43:54.270 --> 43:56.530
is how are their
livers still functioning?

43:56.570 --> 43:59.110
They have been
coming here for years.

43:59.150 --> 44:00.780
Huh.

44:00.820 --> 44:01.860
I heard a rumor

44:01.910 --> 44:03.379
that they used to
be Lila's boyfriends

44:03.410 --> 44:05.200
back when she used to dance.

44:05.240 --> 44:06.700
Lila used to do this?

44:06.740 --> 44:08.450
God only knows.

44:08.500 --> 44:10.960
I'm not about to
start asking questions.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.040
Fair enough.

44:13.080 --> 44:15.540
All right, watch Brandy.

44:15.590 --> 44:17.090
She's okay.

44:20.510 --> 44:22.220
Yeah, but they
don't stand up for her

44:22.260 --> 44:24.300
like they do for you.

44:24.340 --> 44:25.890
What does that mean?

44:25.930 --> 44:27.640
Beats me.

44:27.680 --> 44:29.640
Maybe it's better if they sit.

44:29.680 --> 44:31.100
I don't think so.

44:31.140 --> 44:33.400
I think it's their
way of honoring you.

44:33.440 --> 44:35.730
Fuck that, honor me with tips.

44:35.770 --> 44:38.440
All right, you
should go on next.

44:38.480 --> 44:39.820
What, right now?

44:39.860 --> 44:41.950
Yeah, go get changed.

44:41.990 --> 44:43.570
Okay.

44:43.610 --> 44:45.950
Is that okay?

44:45.990 --> 44:48.660
Look, the secret is to do
it for only one person.

44:48.700 --> 44:50.910
Now that person
doesn't need to be here,

44:50.950 --> 44:54.000
but you just need to do
it for somebody somewhere,

44:54.040 --> 44:55.920
get it?

44:55.960 --> 44:57.210
That doesn't help me at all.

46:02.990 --> 46:04.700
Where do you even go?

46:04.740 --> 46:05.860
You leave here

46:05.900 --> 46:07.216
and then I don't
hear from you at all.

46:07.240 --> 46:08.740
Oh, but I pay
your bills, don't I?

46:08.780 --> 46:10.330
So, WHAT THE FUCK, Rollie?!

46:10.370 --> 46:12.040
Where are you?

46:12.080 --> 46:13.910
I am sitting here,
I'm slaving away.

46:13.950 --> 46:15.330
You think I signed up for this?

46:15.370 --> 46:16.330
God!

46:16.370 --> 46:18.250
Look who dropped in.

46:18.290 --> 46:19.420
Who is he?

46:19.460 --> 46:21.550
That's Lila's husband
Rollie, we think.

46:21.590 --> 46:22.606
She never talks about him.

46:22.630 --> 46:24.760
He never seems to be around.

46:24.800 --> 46:25.920
Where's he been?

46:25.970 --> 46:27.090
Beats me.

46:27.130 --> 46:28.550
Oh, don't look at me like that

46:28.590 --> 46:30.010
you little hang dog pussy!

46:30.050 --> 46:31.720
Can't say I blame him.

46:31.760 --> 46:33.983
You spend all your time making
those stupid ol' pictures!

47:38.620 --> 47:43.250
Sorry, no ice.

47:43.290 --> 47:46.340
Sorry, menthol.

48:10.030 --> 48:12.660
What's with the rock?

48:12.700 --> 48:14.160
I'm gonna bring him back home

48:14.200 --> 48:16.830
to where he came from.

48:16.870 --> 48:18.120
And?

48:18.160 --> 48:20.710
It's far.

48:20.750 --> 48:23.540
Isn't that enough?

48:23.580 --> 48:25.880
You tell me.

48:45.690 --> 48:47.480
Why is she so mad at you?

48:47.520 --> 48:53.200
I do as I please probably
more often than I should.

48:53.240 --> 48:55.910
How long you been doing that?

48:55.950 --> 48:57.830
Decades.

49:03.420 --> 49:06.590
So what happens?

49:06.630 --> 49:08.670
Does it get different?

49:08.710 --> 49:10.880
Always escaping her annoyances

49:10.920 --> 49:12.420
can become as much a prison

49:12.470 --> 49:14.510
as the annoyances themselves.

49:14.550 --> 49:16.850
And your annoyance?

49:30.480 --> 49:33.950
So, what do you then?

49:33.990 --> 49:38.030
How do you deal with this cycle?

49:38.080 --> 49:41.540
Who says anything
had to be dealt with?

49:45.960 --> 49:47.710
What should I do?

49:47.750 --> 49:49.460
You don't have to do anything.

49:49.500 --> 49:50.750
That's the problem,

49:50.800 --> 49:53.420
everyone thinks something
needs to be done.

49:53.470 --> 49:56.090
What makes you think there's
anything to be done

49:56.130 --> 49:59.140
that would
really change anything?

49:59.180 --> 50:03.980
And if it did,
would it even matter?

50:04.020 --> 50:07.440
Maybe for you
it's already too late.

50:16.200 --> 50:17.240
Why are you here?

50:17.280 --> 50:19.160
Why'd you even come back?

50:19.200 --> 50:20.490
This is where I live.

50:20.530 --> 50:22.160
Got to check the
mail once in a while.

50:22.200 --> 50:24.660
Maybe you need something here.

50:24.700 --> 50:26.500
I'm my own man.

50:30.040 --> 50:32.960
What's your excuse?

50:39.850 --> 50:42.140
I'm my own man, too.

54:17.270 --> 54:19.230
That's odd.

54:19.270 --> 54:21.480
From the moment I came here,

54:21.520 --> 54:23.320
the strangest
thing about this place

54:23.360 --> 54:26.740
was how docile
the old fuckers were.

54:26.780 --> 54:28.740
In fact, it kind
of weirded me out

54:28.780 --> 54:31.990
how little physical contact
there was in the place.

54:32.040 --> 54:35.750
I wouldn't have minded their
occasional feel being copped,

54:35.790 --> 54:39.540
but I guess that's not the
situation for everyone.

54:40.380 --> 54:44.840
It depends who you are
and what your sick of.

55:00.980 --> 55:02.690
It's okay.

55:23.040 --> 55:24.960
What was that all about?!

55:25.000 --> 55:26.920
Who do you think you are?!

55:26.970 --> 55:29.090
You stupid bitch!

55:29.130 --> 55:30.486
What do you think
was going on in there?

55:30.510 --> 55:31.890
What were you doing?

55:31.930 --> 55:33.156
What makes you think
you can hit him?!

55:33.180 --> 55:35.970
Don't you know how
precious that old man is?!

56:52.130 --> 56:54.720
You're fired.

56:54.760 --> 56:58.060
That works.

59:05.310 --> 59:06.940
Is that why they
call you Brandy?

59:06.980 --> 59:08.350
No, I switched to Brandy

59:08.390 --> 59:10.190
'cause that's what
they've always called me.

59:10.230 --> 59:11.190
Makes sense.

59:11.230 --> 59:12.190
Hey, do you want a
ride somewhere,

59:12.230 --> 59:15.530
like, maybe, say, the airport?

59:15.570 --> 59:17.280
Nice of Jenny to
lend us her car.

59:17.320 --> 59:20.160
Nah, it's Lila's, too.

59:20.200 --> 59:26.370
I just need to make
one stop along the way.

59:58.950 --> 01:00:00.740
Who is this kid?

01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:02.530
Is he yours?

01:00:02.570 --> 01:00:03.990
I don't like kids.

01:00:04.030 --> 01:00:06.700
I just need you to
give this note to him.

01:00:07.290 --> 01:00:09.750
Can kids even read?

01:00:09.790 --> 01:00:13.170
They can't, kids can't read.

01:00:13.210 --> 01:00:19.090
Kids can't even read.

01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:21.930
I don't have to,
like, talk to him, do I?

01:00:21.970 --> 01:00:26.850
I really don't want
to talk to any kids.

01:00:26.890 --> 01:00:28.680
Okay.

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:08.430
Can you read?!

01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:12.390
That's - for - you.

01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:16.440
Read it!

01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:22.200
Do - you - understand?

01:02:08.410 --> 01:02:09.870
What's going on?

01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:11.660
Just some kids.

01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:12.870
You okay?

01:02:12.910 --> 01:02:14.500
Yeah.

01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:16.210
It's almost time
for your bath, okay?

01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:17.750
Okay.

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:34.560
Dear George, this is your mom.

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:36.230
I'm sorry to write when I know

01:02:36.270 --> 01:02:38.230
you don't want to hear from me,

01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:44.820
but listen, anyway,
I know you can read this.

01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:48.570
If you still don't want
to see me I understand,

01:02:48.610 --> 01:02:52.240
but there's something that
I want you to know.

01:02:54.910 --> 01:02:57.420
I see you my little man.

01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:59.670
I see you everywhere.

01:02:59.710 --> 01:03:02.000
I see you in the faces around me

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:03.210
and the little kids I pass,

01:03:03.250 --> 01:03:06.590
but also in the
grownups, I can't help it.

01:03:25.070 --> 01:03:27.610
Your friend the rock is on
its way back to the beach

01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:29.740
where you found him.

01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:34.290
I agree, it's where he belongs.

01:03:34.330 --> 01:03:39.170
So, I'll be away for a few days,

01:03:42.170 --> 01:03:44.300
I'm not pressuring
you into taking me back,

01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:47.840
that's not what I'm saying.

01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:53.470
I just want you to
know I'll always be here.

01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:57.640
You can't make that go away.

01:05:58.010 --> 01:06:00.100
A year ago when I came here,

01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:03.680
I had my bearings
completely straight.

01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:05.730
That's not a metaphor.

01:06:05.770 --> 01:06:08.610
I mean I actually knew
where everything was,

01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:11.360
never got lost.

01:06:11.650 --> 01:06:16.860
I did know, I thought I did.

01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:36.680
What's the
progression of things?

01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:41.180
Things are supposed to
get better, aren't they?

01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:46.480
Aren't the things we learned
supposed to teach us,

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:48.850
make us better?

01:06:52.070 --> 01:06:53.230
When you have your compass

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:56.240
and you've got the
streets mapped out,

01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:58.820
how do you ever
manage to unlearn that?

01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:30.830
I, I don't speak Spanish.

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:39.880
I don't understand
anything you're saying.

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:41.590
No habla EspaÃ±ol.

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:07.970
Dear George,
here comes another letter.

01:10:08.010 --> 01:10:10.180
Sorry if it's just
a tiny bit at odds

01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:13.600
with what I said the first time.

01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:17.980
I've have had a change of plans.

01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:19.650
That little rock of yours

01:10:19.690 --> 01:10:22.030
I have carried it everywhere.

01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:23.820
For a long time

01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:25.700
It was a lot heavier
than it looked too,

01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:29.410
always sitting there
in the bottom of my purse

01:10:30.490 --> 01:10:31.990
but you know what?

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:35.040
As much as I hate to admit it

01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:37.710
I like the extra weight.

01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:41.050
I might even... need it.

01:10:41.090 --> 01:10:46.470
It's something you
should experience too.

01:10:46.510 --> 01:10:50.300
And so, if I can just
find the damn thing again.

01:10:50.350 --> 01:10:52.720
I'm going to carry
it a little bit further

01:10:52.770 --> 01:10:54.730
and bring it back to you.

01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:57.770
Back to the same
room in the same motel

01:12:57.810 --> 01:13:01.060
where I started this.

01:13:36.010 --> 01:13:37.350
You're fuckin' grounded.

01:13:37.390 --> 01:13:38.390
Get the fuck down.

01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:43.390
Mmm.

01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:49.690
Hello.

01:14:02.290 --> 01:14:03.750
Hey!

01:14:03.790 --> 01:14:05.580
Hey, you stupid bitch!

01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:07.750
This is not a rental company!

01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:09.250
She's totally leaving it.

01:14:09.290 --> 01:14:11.210
Maybe fill it up this time!
