00:57.290 --> 01:00.625
Wait! Come back!

01:01.962 --> 01:04.663
No, don't do this!

01:05.798 --> 01:08.600
Aah! Stop!

01:08.602 --> 01:11.836
Aah! Aah!

03:16.495 --> 03:18.830
What's up, Austin!

03:20.867 --> 03:23.802
That's my sister right there.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.770
Hayley, you rock!

03:25.772 --> 03:29.073
We have a little song
about obsession.

03:32.344 --> 03:35.280
Aah!

03:41.921 --> 03:46.691
<i>♪ The voice said to go</i>

03:46.693 --> 03:48.760
<i>♪ Move me</i>

03:48.762 --> 03:52.831
<i>♪ Impossibly tall</i>

03:52.833 --> 03:55.366
<i>♪ To walk and I've over it</i>

03:55.368 --> 03:58.870
<i>It was always</i>
<i>me and my brother.</i>

03:58.872 --> 04:01.172
<i>We used to hide</i>
<i>under my bunk bed.</i>

04:01.174 --> 04:03.208
<i>I'd come up with a line.</i>

04:03.210 --> 04:07.078
<i>Jack would pluck a melody</i>
<i>out of the air.</i>

04:07.080 --> 04:09.981
<i>But then the songs</i>
<i>started to work.</i>

04:09.983 --> 04:13.818
<i>♪ Let me in, let me in</i>

04:13.820 --> 04:18.923
<i>♪ the look in your eye
that is punishing me ♪</i>

04:20.526 --> 04:24.095
<i>So we packed up the truck</i>
<i>and moved to L.A.</i>

04:24.097 --> 04:27.432
Whoo! Oh, my God!

04:27.434 --> 04:31.402
<i>The music was like</i>
<i>our secret place.</i>

04:31.404 --> 04:35.106
<i>And Jack and I</i>
<i>were two halves of the key.</i>

04:42.748 --> 04:45.383
And we walk towards the fire.

04:45.385 --> 04:47.518
Ready to erupt.

04:49.922 --> 04:51.589
<i>Nothing could hurt us.</i>

04:51.591 --> 04:55.326
<i>Because Jack and I</i>
<i>had each other.</i>

04:56.629 --> 04:58.897
<i>And then I met Carter.</i>

04:58.899 --> 05:00.365
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:00.367 --> 05:02.500
<i>He's a journalist,</i>
<i>not a musician.</i>

05:04.003 --> 05:07.939
<i>But he loved my lyrics,</i>
<i>my words.</i>

05:09.742 --> 05:12.043
<i>Things happened really fast.</i>

05:12.045 --> 05:14.712
<i>Pregnant with twins.</i>

05:14.714 --> 05:16.114
Beautiful.

05:16.116 --> 05:20.184
<i>I was 19.</i>

05:20.186 --> 05:22.887
<i>Carter's daughter Lila</i>
<i>was our flower girl.</i>

05:22.889 --> 05:25.156
<i>She lives with her mom</i>
<i>half the time.</i>

05:25.158 --> 05:26.858
<i>Jack was our best man.</i>

05:26.860 --> 05:29.994
Do you cherish her?

05:29.996 --> 05:31.029
- Of course.
- Cherish her.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.730
Of course.

05:32.732 --> 05:34.832
Jack!

05:34.834 --> 05:37.669
- I love you.
- I love you too.

05:39.271 --> 05:40.705
Bye.

05:40.707 --> 05:42.340
Okay.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.374
Bye!

06:02.161 --> 06:04.429
<i>Carter and I were</i>
<i>baby Bjorning it.</i>

06:04.431 --> 06:08.599
<i>Jack was busy</i>
<i>doing what rock stars do.</i>

06:14.274 --> 06:18.309
<i>♪ We are the flesh,
we are the blood ♪</i>

06:18.311 --> 06:20.511
<i>♪ Baby, you and me</i>

06:20.513 --> 06:24.248
we got Willie Nelson
coming to our show.

06:24.250 --> 06:26.150
Gonna get high with Willie.

06:27.987 --> 06:30.555
Give it to me.

06:30.557 --> 06:31.923
Jack. Jack.

06:31.925 --> 06:35.259
Jack. Go fucking call
an ambulance!

06:35.261 --> 06:36.928
He's od-ing.

06:36.930 --> 06:39.564
Baby, wake up.

06:50.576 --> 06:54.145
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>if it was the hand of fate</i>

06:54.147 --> 06:57.382
<i>or if I'd abandoned him.</i>

07:02.154 --> 07:05.590
<i>The guilt pulled me</i>
<i>away from my husband</i>

07:05.592 --> 07:08.059
<i>and my kids.</i>

07:11.730 --> 07:16.167
<i>It took months before I even</i>
<i>started to write again.</i>

07:20.139 --> 07:23.808
But then the lyrics
just poured out of me

07:23.810 --> 07:25.710
like a volcano.

07:25.712 --> 07:28.079
And then all the songs

07:28.081 --> 07:31.049
ended up being about Jack.

07:31.051 --> 07:33.785
I like your new hair.
Blond.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.587
Kind of like a rock-angel
thing going on.

07:36.589 --> 07:38.356
Yeah. Yeah.

07:38.358 --> 07:42.393
So how do you replace someone

07:42.395 --> 07:46.831
as special as your
brother on guitar?

07:49.768 --> 07:52.103
Well...

07:52.105 --> 07:53.738
Uh...

07:53.740 --> 07:56.641
Enzo is--is great.

07:56.643 --> 07:59.410
<i>Annie heard him playing</i>
<i>in a bar.</i>

08:03.382 --> 08:05.183
<i>At the audition,
it turned out</i>

08:05.185 --> 08:09.253
<i>he knew all of our songs</i>
<i>really well.</i>

08:09.255 --> 08:13.324
<i>Enzo sort of looked like</i>
<i>my brother.</i>

08:13.326 --> 08:15.226
- Rock and roll.
- You got it, baby.

08:15.228 --> 08:16.727
You'll hear him.
He's coming on--

08:16.729 --> 08:18.396
I'm so sorry, guys.

08:18.398 --> 08:21.866
The limo's here.
We can meet at a place...

08:21.868 --> 08:23.401
Yeah.

08:23.403 --> 08:25.937
Nobody can replace my brother.

08:25.939 --> 08:28.473
That's--that's not
what this is about.

08:28.475 --> 08:33.177
This album is just my way
of honoring him.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.212
Well, I look forward
to hearing it.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.613
Thank you.

08:37.182 --> 08:38.950
Hiya!

08:38.952 --> 08:41.184
Oh! Oh!

08:41.187 --> 08:43.654
This is my ball! Ha ha.

08:43.655 --> 08:45.022
How'd it go?

08:45.024 --> 08:48.326
Well, I think we have ourselves
another <i>spin</i> cover.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.495
- Fingers crossed, right?
- Mm-hmm.

08:50.497 --> 08:53.231
- All right, thanks again.
- Thank you. Bye.

08:53.233 --> 08:56.033
- Oh. Put that in the car?
- Yeah. Hurry up.

08:56.035 --> 08:57.101
I'll just be a sec.

08:57.103 --> 08:58.136
Say goodbye to your mother.

08:58.138 --> 09:01.405
Wow! Good hug.

09:01.407 --> 09:03.007
I'm going to miss you guys.

09:03.009 --> 09:05.243
I love you.

09:05.245 --> 09:07.678
You guys go with
Mrs. R. Now, okay?

09:07.680 --> 09:10.515
I'm going to go say
goodbye to daddy.

09:15.554 --> 09:17.388
Mmm.

09:20.092 --> 09:22.260
You okay?

09:22.262 --> 09:24.862
- Yeah. Just...
- Yeah?

09:24.864 --> 09:28.032
Never perform without Jack.

09:28.034 --> 09:32.303
Well, it's Austin.
It's your home turf.

09:32.305 --> 09:35.540
Say your byes.
Let's do this.

09:36.808 --> 09:39.177
- Bye.
- Bye.

10:04.870 --> 10:06.604
Johnny!

10:09.041 --> 10:10.575
Hayley!

10:18.283 --> 10:20.184
Open.

10:20.186 --> 10:22.553
- Ahh.
- Ahh.

10:22.555 --> 10:24.789
- Highly inflamed.
- Yep.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.290
You need to moderate
your drinking--

10:26.292 --> 10:28.693
Let's just administer the shot,
okay, doc?

10:30.195 --> 10:32.663
Just a little numbing spray.

10:32.665 --> 10:34.865
Okay. So this is going
to go down your nose.

10:34.867 --> 10:36.000
There we go.

10:36.002 --> 10:37.335
Say "ahh."

10:37.337 --> 10:39.470
- Ahh.
- A little prick.

10:42.241 --> 10:45.376

Thank you, Austin.

12:05.024 --> 12:06.691
Y'all are awesome.

12:06.693 --> 12:10.895
So our new album came out today.

12:10.897 --> 12:15.166
And we're going to play
a new song off of that.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.068
This is for Jack.

12:28.447 --> 12:30.915
<i>♪ Where did you go</i>

14:06.144 --> 14:08.579
Thank you so much, Austin.

14:15.687 --> 14:18.155
Give me a second. Yeah?

14:18.157 --> 14:21.992
Uh, did you hear the applause
on "half of me"?

14:21.994 --> 14:23.194
Yeah.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.996
No. There wasn't any.

14:25.998 --> 14:29.300
Sometimes the new ones
take time to grow on you.

14:29.302 --> 14:31.235
You know that.

14:33.472 --> 14:36.740
Okay? Smile.
It's your party.

15:18.517 --> 15:22.152
Hayley, can you sign this
for me, please?

15:22.154 --> 15:24.221
- Sure.
- Thanks.

15:25.457 --> 15:27.625
Big fan.

15:31.429 --> 15:34.231
Can you kiss that too
with the black?

15:34.233 --> 15:36.066
I'm sorry?

15:36.068 --> 15:37.701
Just put on the black
lipstick and kiss it.

15:37.703 --> 15:41.505
Uh, that's not really my color.

15:41.507 --> 15:44.174
Just put the lipstick on, okay?

15:44.176 --> 15:48.979
Hey! She said it's not her color.

15:54.386 --> 15:55.619
Hey!

15:55.621 --> 15:57.555
Come here!

16:01.960 --> 16:03.594
Hayley!

16:03.596 --> 16:06.997
Hayley, come back here!

16:44.903 --> 16:48.138
I better walk you
to your room just in case.

16:48.140 --> 16:49.173
Okay.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.942
Do you--

16:51.944 --> 16:53.744
do you want to come and hang
out for a little bit

16:53.746 --> 16:56.146
or is--is that awkward?

16:57.515 --> 16:59.750
Come on, girlfriend.

16:59.752 --> 17:02.353
Who's going to worry about me?

17:02.355 --> 17:05.122
Okay.

17:09.728 --> 17:11.795
You shouldn't look at that.

17:13.298 --> 17:16.367
Yeah, well, I try not to, but...

17:16.368 --> 17:19.603
This guy has written, like,
half a fucking novel

17:19.605 --> 17:22.473
about how I don't have
any talent left.

17:22.474 --> 17:24.775
The new songs are
too sentimental,

17:24.777 --> 17:26.710
and they don't have any edge.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.378
Hayley, don't read the blogs.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.147
I mean, even the douche bag
from <i>spin</i> hated it.

17:30.149 --> 17:32.816
Like, of everything I've done,

17:32.818 --> 17:34.184
you would think that this time

17:34.186 --> 17:36.453
they would have a
little more compassion.

17:36.455 --> 17:37.921
You can't take this personally.

17:37.923 --> 17:39.523
Well, I wrote, like,
half a dozen songs

17:39.525 --> 17:42.793
about the death of my brother.
It's pretty personal.

17:49.734 --> 17:52.369
Hayley...

17:52.371 --> 17:56.407
You already got one going
over there.

17:58.343 --> 18:00.244
Yeah, I do.

18:06.985 --> 18:09.753
Look, maybe you just
need someone

18:09.755 --> 18:11.355
to bounce some stuff off of.

18:11.357 --> 18:13.857
Like you and Jack did.

18:17.562 --> 18:20.030
Come on, sit down.

18:21.933 --> 18:26.336
I am going to give you
a neck rub.

18:27.772 --> 18:30.307
My little goody bag.

18:32.110 --> 18:35.979
- For you.
- Thank you.

18:41.686 --> 18:44.021
Just relax.

18:53.098 --> 18:56.700
I don't know if it's
the Xanax or the vodka,

18:56.702 --> 18:59.269
but I'm feeling kind of trancy.

19:03.508 --> 19:05.676
Unh.
Feel that?

19:05.678 --> 19:06.777
Ahh.

19:06.779 --> 19:09.847
That is a massive knot.

19:09.849 --> 19:13.751
Girlfriend, you are stressed.

19:13.753 --> 19:17.788
Mind if I go deep down
into the tissue?

19:17.790 --> 19:20.090
Go as hard as you can.

19:42.847 --> 19:45.883
I'll do anything you want, Hayley.

19:45.885 --> 19:48.051
I just want you to feel good.

19:48.053 --> 19:52.456
It feels really good.

21:01.192 --> 21:03.994
Mommy, I hate rabies.

21:03.996 --> 21:06.063
Rabies?
Okay.

21:06.065 --> 21:08.265
You're looking better, Benjy.

21:08.267 --> 21:11.435
I like your scarf, Lila.
Very cool.

21:12.871 --> 21:14.805
I want to go back to my friends.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.006
Okay.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.976
- Bye.
- Talk to you then.

21:18.978 --> 21:21.178
What are you working on?

21:21.180 --> 21:24.948
Trying to finish that
Texas debutante murder story

21:24.950 --> 21:26.483
for <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

21:26.485 --> 21:28.685
There's so many grisly details
about the bucket,

21:28.687 --> 21:30.988
knots of hair, and--

21:32.924 --> 21:36.426
Sorry. Being a dick.

21:36.428 --> 21:39.930
Just distracted
with everything going on.

21:39.932 --> 21:42.699
But I'm here.

21:42.701 --> 21:45.535
Wow. You look relaxed,

21:45.537 --> 21:48.538
like you went to the spa
or something.

21:48.540 --> 21:50.040
I miss you.

21:50.042 --> 21:52.242
Yeah, I miss you too.

21:52.244 --> 21:55.445
Carter, some of the bloggers
have not been very positive

21:55.447 --> 21:56.780
about the new album.

21:56.782 --> 21:58.916
Those bozos are just jealous,

21:58.918 --> 22:01.218
I'm just saying.

22:01.220 --> 22:02.986
You know, and you don't
even need to do another album

22:02.988 --> 22:04.221
for a while.

22:04.223 --> 22:05.722
You know, after I get
this book deal--

22:05.724 --> 22:08.425
Make a few bucks--
You could take some time off.

22:08.427 --> 22:09.893
Are you up?

22:09.895 --> 22:11.595
Just a second.

22:11.597 --> 22:16.400
Okay. I got to go brace myself
for whatever's next. Bye.

22:16.402 --> 22:17.868
Bye.

22:17.870 --> 22:19.736
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:19.738 --> 22:22.940
Where you Skype sexting Carter
by any chance?

22:22.942 --> 22:27.244
Ew! That's for my children.
Thank you. You're disgusting.

22:27.246 --> 22:28.445
Okay.

22:28.447 --> 22:32.382
Ah, are you hungry?
I brought you food.

22:32.384 --> 22:33.684
Wow. Glamorous.

22:33.686 --> 22:36.386
Has the label cut our
expense account already?

22:40.625 --> 22:41.959
What?

22:41.961 --> 22:44.328
Are you serious?
Are sales really that bad?

22:44.330 --> 22:48.632
It's early.
Can't really...

22:48.634 --> 22:50.200
What is this?

22:50.202 --> 22:52.536
No, Annie, it's not--
It's not early.

22:52.538 --> 22:54.671
It's not like
we're some new band.

22:54.673 --> 22:57.274
I mean, if anything we should
come out strong and fade.

22:57.276 --> 23:00.644
You just stay positive
and I worry about the numbers.

23:00.646 --> 23:02.212
This is so sticky here.

23:02.214 --> 23:04.414
What are they cleaning
this thing with? Ugh.

23:04.416 --> 23:05.749
What did you--

23:05.751 --> 23:08.952
What did the other bands that you
managed do in this situation?

23:08.954 --> 23:13.223
Um, well,
I have a comeback list.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.859
Stop calling me, please.

23:15.861 --> 23:17.427
Okay. Here we go.

23:17.429 --> 23:20.931
Yes, number one--
You hold a big charity event.

23:20.933 --> 23:22.566
I'm already talking
to whale people.

23:22.568 --> 23:23.600
That one's done.

23:23.602 --> 23:25.869
Number two--
Date a hot celebrity.

23:25.871 --> 23:27.204
Obviously not an option.

23:27.206 --> 23:28.905
Obviously always an option.

23:28.907 --> 23:32.509
Number three--
You just get out and...

23:32.511 --> 23:35.779
This one has a tendency
to backfire. Delete.

23:35.781 --> 23:38.782
You know what? You just have
to write a great song.

23:38.784 --> 23:40.751
With more edge.

24:22.727 --> 24:24.294
Get your jacket.

24:24.296 --> 24:27.064
And bring your guitar.

24:38.910 --> 24:41.478
Come on!

25:06.938 --> 25:08.438
There's a guy.

25:12.243 --> 25:15.745
Back up, motherfucker!

25:17.248 --> 25:19.416
Enzo, it's a deer.

25:21.085 --> 25:22.652
Deer don't attack people.

25:22.654 --> 25:27.691
Well, there's been
a few cases reported.

25:27.693 --> 25:29.559
Heh. Come on.

25:31.529 --> 25:35.499
Annie told me to write
a new hit song.

25:35.501 --> 25:38.435
Like I can just
push a button or something.

25:38.437 --> 25:41.938
You bring your little book?

25:41.940 --> 25:44.508
Let me hear some lyrics.

25:44.510 --> 25:47.244
Come on.

25:47.246 --> 25:49.346
Okay. I have something.

25:49.348 --> 25:52.082
But it's really rough, okay?

25:52.084 --> 25:53.617
As long as it's really rough.

25:53.619 --> 25:55.752
- It's really rough.
- Okay, good.

25:55.754 --> 25:59.089
So I just have that.

25:59.091 --> 26:02.292
And I thought
it would kind of go--

26:02.294 --> 26:06.463
<i>♪ If I let you in</i>

26:06.465 --> 26:10.567
<i>♪ Let you see inside</i>

26:10.569 --> 26:12.102
no, that sucks.

26:12.104 --> 26:15.071
- No, it's good.
- Uh-uh.

26:15.073 --> 26:17.407
Try something like...

26:24.782 --> 26:26.416
Okay.

26:26.418 --> 26:29.219
<i>♪ If I let you in</i>

26:29.221 --> 26:31.621
<i>♪ Let you see inside</i>

26:31.623 --> 26:36.126
<i>♪ I don't know
if I can hang on ♪</i>

26:36.128 --> 26:39.429
<i>♪ To what I used to be</i>

26:39.431 --> 26:43.166
<i>♪ I let it die</i>

26:43.168 --> 26:46.002
<i>♪ Crawling around me</i>

26:46.004 --> 26:48.772
<i>♪ It's all yours</i>

26:58.683 --> 27:01.351
No. Stop, Enzo.

27:01.353 --> 27:04.120
I'm trying to be good.

27:04.122 --> 27:06.323
You are good.

27:07.858 --> 27:09.893
Uh-uh. This is crazy.

27:09.895 --> 27:11.561
We have to go. Come on.

27:11.563 --> 27:15.065
What's crazy? That you and I
make great music together

27:15.067 --> 27:16.900
and have even better sex?

27:18.603 --> 27:21.271
We didn't have actual
sex last night.

27:21.273 --> 27:24.174
You know we did.

27:24.176 --> 27:26.476
It's okay.
We used protection.

27:26.478 --> 27:31.848
Enzo, I was really wasted.

27:33.184 --> 27:36.219
I--I have a husband.
I have kids.

27:36.221 --> 27:40.490
And you're into guys.

27:40.492 --> 27:43.460
Whoever said I was gay?

27:45.129 --> 27:47.430
What is gay anyway?

28:03.714 --> 28:05.982
I really don't want
to hurt anybody.

28:09.887 --> 28:11.788
Maybe this could just be

28:11.790 --> 28:16.059
what happens on tour
stays on tour.

28:18.829 --> 28:21.398
I'm really good
at keeping secrets.

28:28.307 --> 28:29.773
Don't worry.

28:33.110 --> 28:36.913
I won't do anything

28:36.915 --> 28:39.215
unless you want me to.

28:39.217 --> 28:41.685
You didn't do anything
like this last night.

28:41.687 --> 28:43.620
Yeah?

28:43.622 --> 28:45.722
First time's always free.

29:03.342 --> 29:05.642
Thank you so much, Austin.

29:09.046 --> 29:10.480
There we go.

29:14.552 --> 29:16.419
Oh, that guy
in a coat and tie--

29:16.421 --> 29:20.223
He dropped that off for you.

29:20.225 --> 29:23.893
Ugh. Fuckin' creepy fan.

29:26.731 --> 29:27.797
Ew...

29:27.799 --> 29:30.033
...These rEviews are brutal.

29:30.035 --> 29:33.203
Apparently her brother
had more than half the talent.

29:33.205 --> 29:35.372
Even <i>Pitchfork</i> doesn't like us.

29:35.374 --> 29:37.207
I almost fell asleep
during the song.

29:37.209 --> 29:38.675
You guys are assholes.

29:41.879 --> 29:45.949
But some of that shit
the critics said was spot on.

29:45.951 --> 29:49.719
Enzo and I have been working
on a new song.

29:49.721 --> 29:52.122
And it's going to blow
your fuckin' brains out

29:52.124 --> 29:55.125
as long as you write
bass line for it.

29:55.127 --> 29:56.793
Yeah!

29:56.795 --> 29:58.695
- Fuck <i>Pitchfork!</i>
<i>- Yeah!</i>

29:58.697 --> 30:00.330
Get me a drink right now!

30:00.332 --> 30:02.732
- Yes, ma'am!
- Thank you.

30:02.734 --> 30:04.367
Uh-uh. Take that.
It's much stronger.

30:04.369 --> 30:05.769
When can we hear the song?

30:05.771 --> 30:07.837
Well, you just keep
the party favors coming,

30:07.839 --> 30:09.205
Giselle, you'll have a
new song by morning.

30:09.207 --> 30:10.340
- Uh-huh.
- Egh!

30:10.342 --> 30:14.277
Aah! Dirty!
I love it. Yeah.

30:14.279 --> 30:16.713
Cheers!

30:29.760 --> 30:31.494
Yeah?

30:32.530 --> 30:34.364
Focus! Okay.

30:34.366 --> 30:37.400
<i>♪ This is what</i>

30:40.305 --> 30:41.371
I think that's good.

30:41.373 --> 30:42.839
- All right.
- Okay.

31:09.800 --> 31:12.602
Wow. Hayley and Jack, huh?

31:12.604 --> 31:13.903
When did you get that?

31:13.905 --> 31:16.339
Uh... I was 19.

31:16.341 --> 31:20.076
A lot of fans got 'em
after your second album.

31:20.078 --> 31:21.377
Didn't you see the photos
on your web site?

31:21.379 --> 31:23.713
No, I must've missed those.

31:23.715 --> 31:27.717
Did you miss this?

33:15.359 --> 33:17.160
Uh, can you stop for a minute?

33:17.162 --> 33:19.562
Those guys are, like,
our only neighbors.

33:19.564 --> 33:22.565
Evie, Paul.

33:22.567 --> 33:26.202
Hi. Beautiful night, huh?

33:30.774 --> 33:32.609
They're friendly.

33:32.611 --> 33:37.280
Yeah. Well, my kids kind of
torture their dogs. So...

33:37.282 --> 33:40.216
It's just this next
driveway here.

33:49.159 --> 33:51.761
Thank you.

33:54.498 --> 33:56.799
Hmm. No one's home.

33:56.801 --> 33:58.334
You going to be okay?

33:58.336 --> 34:01.304
Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure
they'll be home soon.

34:01.306 --> 34:03.272
I think Carter emailed me
something actually.

34:03.274 --> 34:04.474
I'll take this one.

34:04.476 --> 34:07.110
I'll get these.

34:12.850 --> 34:14.717
Thank you.
Want me to wait?

34:14.719 --> 34:17.420
Uh, no. It's fine.
Have a good night.

34:17.422 --> 34:19.722
- You too.
- Bye.

34:49.119 --> 34:51.187
Guys?

34:57.094 --> 34:58.961
Cody?

35:00.664 --> 35:02.999
Benjy?

35:05.202 --> 35:07.136
Mrs. R.?

35:07.138 --> 35:09.572
Carter?

35:13.311 --> 35:14.510
Cody, Benjy?

35:14.512 --> 35:16.612
Aah!

35:16.614 --> 35:18.414
Hey.

35:18.416 --> 35:19.816
What's wrong, mommy?

35:19.818 --> 35:23.186
Nothing.
I just missed you guys.

35:23.188 --> 35:26.522
Uh, where's Mrs. R.?
Where's daddy?

35:26.524 --> 35:28.091
Ciao.

35:28.093 --> 35:29.492
Hi.

35:29.494 --> 35:31.928
Oh, forgive me.
I'm Camila.

35:31.930 --> 35:34.163
I'm your nanny for the day.

35:34.165 --> 35:35.832
Your husband said
he emailed you.

35:35.834 --> 35:38.534
Uh, yeah. Maybe.

35:38.536 --> 35:40.570
I think so. Um...

35:40.572 --> 35:44.273
I brought the boys a gift.
I hope you don't mind.

35:45.643 --> 35:47.276
Uh, Benjy.

35:47.278 --> 35:49.245
- Sorry.
- I accidentally farted.

35:49.247 --> 35:51.314
That's very cool. Thank you.

35:51.316 --> 35:53.516
Your nanny Mrs. R.
Had some family issues.

35:53.518 --> 35:55.051
And so the agency sent me.

35:55.053 --> 35:56.886
Your husband
had a late interview.

35:56.888 --> 35:58.087
I'm sorry for the confusion.

35:58.089 --> 35:59.522
No. It's--it's fine.

35:59.524 --> 36:00.790
I guess I just didn't read
the whole email.

36:00.792 --> 36:02.725
But, um, sorry.

36:02.727 --> 36:03.993
The door was unlocked.

36:03.995 --> 36:05.595
So I just got
a little freaked out.

36:05.597 --> 36:08.798
You have nothing to worry about.
I am practically a ninja.

36:08.800 --> 36:11.834
- Hiya!
- Ya!

36:11.836 --> 36:13.269
Careful guys.

36:13.271 --> 36:15.004
I think you guys
are gonna be happy,

36:15.006 --> 36:17.473
because I've got
presents for you.

36:17.475 --> 36:18.641
Yay!

36:18.643 --> 36:19.909
Where are they?

36:19.911 --> 36:22.645
Yeah!
Where are our presents?

36:22.647 --> 36:24.147
Help.

36:24.149 --> 36:27.650
You know what? I think maybe
I left them in the limo.

36:29.053 --> 36:32.488
Oh. I bet that is
the limo driver right now

36:32.490 --> 36:34.857
calling about your presents.

36:36.160 --> 36:38.060
- Hello?
- Hey, it's Enzo.

36:38.062 --> 36:39.762
I found the puppets in my bag.

36:39.764 --> 36:41.464
Yeah. We were just
looking for them.

36:41.466 --> 36:43.132
Must've put 'em
in there by mistake.

36:43.134 --> 36:44.834
Um, when's a good time
to get them?

36:44.836 --> 36:47.003
How about now?

36:54.244 --> 36:56.312
Hey.

36:56.314 --> 36:58.214
Uh, how--how--

36:58.216 --> 37:00.349
Your little side gate was open.

37:00.351 --> 37:02.251
- Right.
- It's okay. I locked it.

37:04.054 --> 37:06.589
Oh. Here they are.

37:06.591 --> 37:10.359
Awesome. Thank you so much
for driving all the way over.

37:12.496 --> 37:14.497
I missed you a little.

37:16.466 --> 37:21.504
Uh, I've got to go
get back to my tribe.

37:21.506 --> 37:23.139
- Hi!
- Hi!

37:23.141 --> 37:24.574
Guys, look at your presents.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.442
- What does this do?
- Well, let me show you.

37:26.444 --> 37:28.778
- Careful, careful.
- Hold on. I'll show you.

37:28.780 --> 37:30.546
It'll talk right here.

37:30.548 --> 37:31.781
Cool.

37:31.783 --> 37:33.583
But you have to record it first.

37:33.585 --> 37:35.051
But how do we turn it on?

37:35.053 --> 37:39.655
Well, let me see
the instructions.

37:39.657 --> 37:43.025
Hmm. Can't really
read 'em out here.

37:43.027 --> 37:46.229
- Come in.
- Okay.

37:46.231 --> 37:48.431
So what you do.
Excuse me.

37:48.433 --> 37:50.399
You push this button here

37:50.401 --> 37:53.236
on my lovely husband's behind.

37:53.238 --> 37:55.671
And you push it and you talk.
Say something.

37:55.673 --> 37:57.073
I'm going to eat you up.

37:57.075 --> 37:58.808
I'm going to eat you up.

37:58.810 --> 38:00.243
You've been bad.

38:00.245 --> 38:04.046
Okay, guys. You're being weird.
Come on.

38:04.048 --> 38:06.048
Time to go to bed.

38:06.050 --> 38:07.884
I'm sorry.
Extreme kiddy fatigue.

38:07.886 --> 38:10.386
- Night everybody.
- Night, stinky!

38:10.388 --> 38:13.389
Oh, you're the stinky ones!

38:13.391 --> 38:15.524
I'll work on the song tomorrow.

38:15.526 --> 38:16.993
Aah! Fuck, Benjy!

38:16.995 --> 38:18.594
Enzo, really?

38:18.596 --> 38:20.196
Benjy, no biting.

38:20.198 --> 38:22.465
You know, he plays guitar
with that hand, kiddo.

38:22.467 --> 38:24.901
- Sorry, Enzo.
- It's okay.

38:26.203 --> 38:28.471
It's just how I make a living,
you know?

38:28.473 --> 38:29.705
Go brush your teeth, okay?

38:29.707 --> 38:32.775
Go brush your teeth.
I'll be in in a sec.

38:32.777 --> 38:36.178
Uh, are you available tomorrow?

38:36.180 --> 38:38.547
For as long as you'd like.

38:38.549 --> 38:39.749
Cool.

38:39.751 --> 38:43.052
May I?

38:43.054 --> 38:45.421
What a gentleman.

38:53.096 --> 38:56.565
Never leave again.

38:56.567 --> 38:58.067
Except to get dog food.

38:58.069 --> 38:59.335
Dog food?

38:59.337 --> 39:01.804
We don't even have a dog,
Bengal.

39:01.806 --> 39:04.473
But daddy said we will
very soon.

39:07.911 --> 39:09.378
Did he say that?

39:09.380 --> 39:10.746
Yes.

39:10.748 --> 39:13.549
Well, we'll just have
to talk about that another time.

39:13.551 --> 39:15.551
Goodnight, baby.

39:15.553 --> 39:17.019
- Goodnight.
- Muah.

39:17.021 --> 39:18.621
Love you.

39:18.623 --> 39:21.057
Sleep well.
One more kiss. Muah.

39:21.059 --> 39:24.160
Sleep tight, okay?

40:19.150 --> 40:21.350
You're not getting off
that easy.

40:21.352 --> 40:23.753
What's that supposed to mean?

40:25.122 --> 40:27.623
I missed you.

40:56.186 --> 40:57.853
You good?

40:57.855 --> 40:59.088
Yeah. Or do you want--

40:59.090 --> 41:01.924
No, I'm okay. I'm okay.

41:01.926 --> 41:03.426
Sorry.

41:03.428 --> 41:06.595
It has been a while.
But next time I promise.

41:06.597 --> 41:08.431
Scout's honor, it's all you.

41:08.433 --> 41:10.199
Okay.

41:16.139 --> 41:19.508
All right. I'm going. Okay.

41:23.647 --> 41:26.482
I'm glad you're back though.

41:33.924 --> 41:35.724
Good morning.

41:35.726 --> 41:38.360
I hope this video boosts
the sales a little.

41:38.362 --> 41:41.597
So am I going straight
to the choreographer's loft

41:41.599 --> 41:42.631
or what?

41:42.633 --> 41:44.834
I think maybe sit down
for one second.

41:44.836 --> 41:46.502
Okay.

41:52.042 --> 41:54.009
They cut the shit
out of the budget.

41:54.011 --> 41:56.245
Slashed it in half.

41:56.247 --> 41:58.013
Where's--let me use your phone.

41:58.015 --> 42:00.549
- I'm calling Nigel right now.
- I would not recommend--

42:00.551 --> 42:02.685
No, I want him
to tell me himself.

42:02.687 --> 42:05.187
Actually the label
doesn't want a video

42:05.189 --> 42:06.555
for "half of me" anymore.

42:06.557 --> 42:08.424
They killed the shoot, Hayle.

42:08.426 --> 42:11.193
And the money is from me
for the new song.

42:11.195 --> 42:15.064
Annie.

42:15.066 --> 42:17.199
No. No.
That's crazy.

42:17.201 --> 42:19.502
No. You know
what is crazy though?

42:19.504 --> 42:21.937
Driving all day and all
night just to listen

42:21.939 --> 42:24.340
to some scrawny 16 year old girl
and her weirdo brother

42:24.342 --> 42:26.075
play you three songs

42:26.077 --> 42:29.311
in their parents' Mcallen,
Texas, garage. That's crazy.

42:29.313 --> 42:31.347
But it's called faith, Hayle.

42:31.349 --> 42:33.082
And I have believed in you
since the second

42:33.084 --> 42:34.950
I signed up for this insanity.

42:34.952 --> 42:39.355
We'll find a young kid director.
Make something artsy.

42:39.357 --> 42:41.891
I pull every single favor
that I have in this town

42:41.893 --> 42:43.759
and we make this video.

42:43.761 --> 42:45.027
I fuckin' love you.

42:45.029 --> 42:48.230
Yeah? Yes. You are a liar.
But I love you too.

42:48.232 --> 42:49.498
Shit.
I'm good at what I do.

42:49.500 --> 42:50.833
- Okay.
- Okay.

42:50.835 --> 42:53.802
So you go to this
choreography session

42:53.804 --> 42:55.604
and you dance that
little skinny butt off.

42:55.606 --> 42:57.306
Because the label
has already paid for that.

42:57.308 --> 43:00.676
And we make our video
that much better. Yeah?

43:00.678 --> 43:01.877
Thank you.

43:39.750 --> 43:42.017
Wow. Very good.

43:42.019 --> 43:45.254
Hi everyone.

43:45.256 --> 43:49.325
What's--what's happening?

43:49.327 --> 43:51.527
Carter sent me a text.

43:52.896 --> 43:54.964
Oh, yeah.
The puppets broke.

43:54.966 --> 43:58.734
And Camila here said that
Enzo could fix 'em.

43:58.736 --> 44:01.470
I brought the new song anyway.
I wanted to show it to you.

44:01.472 --> 44:03.305
I mixed it last night.

44:03.307 --> 44:07.276
Oh, and I brought
my puppet tool kit.

44:09.512 --> 44:11.814
Well, thank you.
That's very cool.

44:11.816 --> 44:16.552
And he taught me something.
Let's give her a little show.

44:16.554 --> 44:18.554
- Oh, yeah.
- All right. Okay, ready?

44:18.556 --> 44:21.957
- This one.
- Okay. All right.

44:40.645 --> 44:42.444
- Thank you.
- That's awesome.

44:42.446 --> 44:44.613
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

44:44.615 --> 44:46.115
I can't even get you to play
<i>guitar hero.</i>

44:46.117 --> 44:48.550
Enzo's persuasive.

44:48.552 --> 44:51.387
Miss Sinclair,
this came for you.

44:53.356 --> 44:54.957
Um...

44:54.959 --> 44:57.293
Coat and tie fan guy?

44:57.295 --> 44:59.762
How did he get my address?

45:08.271 --> 45:10.873
Is that a snake's head?

45:10.875 --> 45:15.711
Egh. Somebody take that
somewhere else, please.

45:15.713 --> 45:18.514
Yikes.

45:20.083 --> 45:23.519
Who is this fan anyway?

45:26.556 --> 45:30.592
He is, uh, I don't know.
Some psycho in a suit.

45:30.594 --> 45:32.094
He chased me in Austin.

45:32.096 --> 45:33.395
Yeah. It was weird.

45:33.397 --> 45:34.496
He was just, like,
running after us.

45:34.498 --> 45:36.532
We had to hide.

45:36.534 --> 45:40.235
We? Who's we?

45:40.237 --> 45:42.037
I'm not the most macho guy.

45:42.039 --> 45:43.372
So...

45:43.374 --> 45:46.742
We hid instead.

45:46.744 --> 45:50.346
No. No, it was not funny
at the time.

45:50.348 --> 45:54.183
Ooh, ripe.

45:54.185 --> 45:55.351
That reminds me.

45:55.353 --> 45:58.187
I brought tomatoes
from my garden.

45:58.189 --> 46:00.155
Heirloom tomatoes.

46:00.157 --> 46:02.091
Seriously, it's kind of creepy.
Now he's stalking me in L.A.

46:02.093 --> 46:04.126
It's scary.

46:04.128 --> 46:06.895
All the way from Texas
to mess with these guns?

46:06.897 --> 46:08.697
I don't think so.

46:08.699 --> 46:10.165
Yeah, no. I don't think so.

46:10.167 --> 46:14.670
He's welcome to come, huh?
Right? Okay.

46:14.672 --> 46:16.138
Dinner's almost ready.

46:19.309 --> 46:20.776
I hate tomatoes.

46:20.778 --> 46:22.778
Well,
every time you eat one,

46:22.780 --> 46:26.548
you give yourself 10 minutes
of extra super powers.

46:26.550 --> 46:29.351
- Really?
- Whoo-hoo.

46:29.353 --> 46:32.020
Why don't you ease up on
the potato juice a little bit?

46:32.022 --> 46:33.822
You know, just a touch?

46:33.824 --> 46:35.391
Given everything
that's happened,

46:35.393 --> 46:37.092
I think Hayley's earned
the right to unwind a little.

46:37.094 --> 46:38.560
Don't you?

46:39.863 --> 46:43.565
Yeah. Yeah, no.
I think we all have.

46:43.567 --> 46:47.069
Cheers to that.

46:47.071 --> 46:49.571
Cool! Cheers, big ears.

46:52.242 --> 46:53.709
Can I see it?

46:53.711 --> 46:55.544
This?

47:04.487 --> 47:06.655
Who's hair is this?

47:06.657 --> 47:10.692
Well, it belongs to
my soul mate.

47:10.694 --> 47:14.530
Look, mommy.
It's the same color as yours.

47:17.167 --> 47:19.334
Well, lots of people
have that color hair.

47:19.336 --> 47:21.336
It's the same as yours too.

47:21.338 --> 47:23.605
Give it back to Enzo.

47:23.607 --> 47:25.174
- Eh.
- Thank you, sir.

47:25.176 --> 47:26.975
Thank you, sir.

47:32.182 --> 47:33.382
This is good.

47:33.384 --> 47:34.550
- Oh!
- Boom!

47:34.552 --> 47:35.584
Threat neutralized.

47:35.586 --> 47:37.853
Threat neutralized.

47:37.855 --> 47:39.555
Yeah!

47:41.191 --> 47:43.792
Uh, I'm going to go to bed.

47:45.895 --> 47:50.098
Yeah, I should probably go too.

47:50.100 --> 47:51.533
Well,

47:51.535 --> 47:55.871
it has been a lovely evening.

47:55.873 --> 47:59.475
No. No. You're not riding
through the canyon tonight.

47:59.477 --> 48:02.845
Babe, why don't we make him
a bed out there in the studio?

48:02.847 --> 48:05.647
Oh, and I wanted you
to hear the song too.

48:05.649 --> 48:08.984
It's just a demo.
Both of you.

48:08.986 --> 48:12.254
I think I'm going to wait until
she's ready for me to hear it.

48:12.256 --> 48:14.690
I don't really want
to start world war III.

48:14.692 --> 48:16.692
Oh, I hear you on that one.

48:25.335 --> 48:27.336
Uh, let's just call him a cab.

48:27.338 --> 48:29.004
Come on, babe, you have people

48:29.006 --> 48:30.405
stay in your studio
all the time.

48:30.407 --> 48:31.907
Yeah, he's not even drunk.

48:31.909 --> 48:33.575
And you're the judge?
You've been going at it

48:33.577 --> 48:35.644
like it's Mardi Gras all night.

48:35.646 --> 48:38.981
- Whatever you say, dad.
- Whoa.

48:38.983 --> 48:42.117
Come on, Enzo.
Play me that song.

48:42.119 --> 48:46.955
Can't live with 'em,
can't kill 'em, right?

48:46.957 --> 48:48.257
Right.

48:53.863 --> 48:57.065
Not cool, Enzo. You can't
just show up like that.

48:57.067 --> 49:00.402
You told me you wouldn't do
anything unless I wanted you to.

49:00.404 --> 49:03.672
Hayley, your husband texted me.

49:03.674 --> 49:05.040
What was I supposed to do?

49:05.042 --> 49:07.576
I didn't want him to get
all suspicious.

49:07.578 --> 49:10.245
- I'm calling you a cab.
- Just--

49:10.247 --> 49:12.981
Listen.

49:15.653 --> 49:18.353
<i>♪ If I let you in</i>

49:18.355 --> 49:20.589
<i>♪ Let you deep inside</i>

49:20.591 --> 49:25.527
<i>♪ I don't know if I can hold</i>

49:25.529 --> 49:28.230
<i>♪ To what I used to be</i>

49:28.232 --> 49:31.300

49:31.302 --> 49:35.571
<i>♪ Coil around me,

49:36.839 --> 49:39.608
There's a camera over there.

49:44.380 --> 49:45.814
How did you do that?

49:45.816 --> 49:47.482
I've never sounded
like that before.

49:47.484 --> 49:49.051
Tripled your vocals.

49:49.053 --> 49:52.521
Mixed them at slightly
different frequencies.

50:00.730 --> 50:03.231
Don't bite me.

51:20.143 --> 51:21.376
Hey.

51:21.378 --> 51:23.912
You were out there for a while.
How'd it go?

51:23.914 --> 51:27.349
Yeah. We just had to talk about
the track for a bit.

51:27.351 --> 51:30.686
It's just a demo
but it sounds wicked.

51:30.688 --> 51:32.587
Well, that's awesome.

51:32.589 --> 51:34.356
Can't wait to hear it.

51:36.259 --> 51:40.996
All right, so this guy
tied up his victims

51:40.998 --> 51:44.766
with the exact same clove knot
as the debutant killer.

51:44.768 --> 51:47.102
Right?
I'm gonna send you the link.

51:47.104 --> 51:48.170
Fascinating.

51:48.172 --> 51:50.739
Awesome.
I can't wait to see it.

51:50.741 --> 51:53.542
You want to come
take a shower with me?

51:53.544 --> 51:56.545
I took one after my run.

51:56.547 --> 51:57.646
So...

51:57.648 --> 52:00.582
Okay. Well, I'll be back soon.

52:00.584 --> 52:02.751
Okay.

52:02.753 --> 52:05.420
Whoa!

52:41.390 --> 52:43.291
Hayley, check this out.

52:43.293 --> 52:46.828
I'm restringing this piano
with real cow guts.

52:49.265 --> 52:51.466
I'll layer it into the track.

52:51.468 --> 52:55.704
Enzo. Enzo!

52:55.706 --> 52:57.806
You need to back off.

52:57.808 --> 53:00.041
You have to cut me some slack.

53:00.043 --> 53:04.246
This is--it's too much.
Okay?

53:09.819 --> 53:12.554
Um, where's your garden?

53:12.556 --> 53:14.456
Your heirloom tomatoes?

53:16.325 --> 53:17.626
I always say that.

53:17.628 --> 53:19.694
I mean the sunset junction
market.

53:19.696 --> 53:22.464
Pretty much live
out of that place.

53:22.466 --> 53:24.332
Uh...

53:24.334 --> 53:27.469
Oh, look at this Bolex.

53:29.172 --> 53:32.307
It's about the only thing
my father gave me.

53:40.016 --> 53:42.484
I want to show you something.

53:42.486 --> 53:45.320
Something that I made.

53:47.657 --> 53:49.558
Annie liked it.

53:54.297 --> 53:56.698
I'm a very affordable director.

53:56.700 --> 54:00.202
Especially for you.

54:05.741 --> 54:07.909
Irish gin.

54:07.911 --> 54:10.078
Try this.

54:10.080 --> 54:13.415
My friends in Portland
home brewed it.

54:15.051 --> 54:19.287
Why am I not surprised
that you make films, Enzo?

54:22.893 --> 54:26.127
I made this a long time ago.

54:26.129 --> 54:29.197
Kind of my early
childhood memories.

54:37.273 --> 54:41.910
My father thought
I was too effeminate.

54:42.912 --> 54:46.047
I'm sorry.

54:49.118 --> 54:52.354
Only my mother
really understood me.

54:56.859 --> 54:58.960
That's my sister.

54:58.962 --> 55:02.097
My real sister.
Daddy's favorite.

55:02.099 --> 55:03.965
She's beautiful.

55:03.967 --> 55:06.501
Very cool style.

55:06.503 --> 55:08.637
So do I get the job?

55:11.073 --> 55:14.075
Yes. It's stunning.

55:16.579 --> 55:19.047
I mean, you inspired me.

55:19.049 --> 55:22.083
Even way before I met you,

55:22.085 --> 55:26.054
I used to listen to your songs
over and over

55:26.056 --> 55:29.190
and play along with them.

55:29.192 --> 55:32.027
Wow, your sister's
a really good actress.

55:33.996 --> 55:36.665
Her fear seems very real.

55:36.667 --> 55:39.968
Yeah.

55:55.151 --> 55:59.421
Wow. Enzo, it's so...

55:59.423 --> 56:01.790
Disturbing.

56:01.792 --> 56:04.826
So universal.

56:04.828 --> 56:06.995
Pain, pleasure.

56:06.997 --> 56:08.830
Light, darkness.

56:08.832 --> 56:12.534
In order to create...

56:15.571 --> 56:18.740
You have to embrace
the dark side.

56:24.180 --> 56:26.081
Stay right there.

56:26.083 --> 56:28.116
You'll do whatever I say.

56:42.465 --> 56:44.632
Shh.

56:44.634 --> 56:46.668
Yes.

56:46.670 --> 56:48.903
You can struggle.

56:48.905 --> 56:51.606
But you can't escape.

56:51.608 --> 56:54.876
Okay. Get up.

56:54.878 --> 56:57.445
Reload.

56:58.748 --> 57:00.215
Thank you.

57:20.536 --> 57:22.570
That's great.

57:24.306 --> 57:27.409
This is a macro lens.

57:27.411 --> 57:30.445
It'll get you in closer.

57:35.117 --> 57:36.785
Get on the ground.

57:36.787 --> 57:38.420
Hey!

57:41.690 --> 57:44.059
This is awkward, huh?

57:44.061 --> 57:46.528
Yeah.
You know if he wasn't gay,

57:46.530 --> 57:49.330
I might just have to kill him.

57:50.566 --> 57:54.035
Anyway, the lime
tree's gonna fall.

57:54.037 --> 57:55.437
So I'm gonna brace it.

57:55.439 --> 57:57.138
Sean, could you put
a little lip gloss

57:57.140 --> 57:59.074
on my finger, please?

58:00.543 --> 58:02.444
Thanks.

58:08.751 --> 58:09.818
And we're rolling.

58:15.257 --> 58:17.225
Part your lips.

58:29.171 --> 58:31.606
Do not push her too hard.

58:31.608 --> 58:34.742
We're shooting the
wide stuff now anyway.

58:34.744 --> 58:39.147
Annie, I know exactly
how hard to push.

58:46.388 --> 58:48.256
Tighten the dress up.

58:48.258 --> 58:50.291
Even more.

58:50.293 --> 58:51.793
Annie, can I get a drink.

58:51.795 --> 58:53.595
I'm on it.

58:53.597 --> 58:55.864
- Like, a real drink?
- Definitely on it.

58:55.866 --> 58:57.765
Suck it.

58:57.767 --> 58:59.634
There you go.

58:59.636 --> 59:02.770
Okay. That's good. Thank you.
All right.

59:07.042 --> 59:10.145
Ah. Camila, why don't you
take 'em in the house?

59:10.147 --> 59:12.313
Oh. Come on.

59:12.315 --> 59:14.115
Are my kids wearing leashes?

59:14.117 --> 59:16.384
Uh... I think so. Yeah.

59:16.386 --> 59:18.620
They're not gonna get
lost in the crowd.

59:18.622 --> 59:20.688
And we're back.

59:26.495 --> 59:29.197

You guys, the label is gonna
flip over this new video.

01:00:45.008 --> 01:00:47.308
Oh, my God!

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:49.510
Enzo, come here!

01:00:49.512 --> 01:00:52.180
Enzo,
I'm going to Nigel right away.

01:00:52.182 --> 01:00:55.984
Ahh! Uh. I'm so happy.
Happy manager! Happy manager!

01:00:55.986 --> 01:00:57.852
The partridge family is here.

01:00:57.854 --> 01:00:59.487
You guys want to give 'em
some space.

01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:01.022
- Sure.
- Let's do it.

01:01:01.024 --> 01:01:04.425
Come on. Enzo, that means
you too. Come on.

01:01:08.964 --> 01:01:13.901
Let's give them
some family time. Okay?

01:01:51.341 --> 01:01:52.974
Get your ski on.

01:01:52.976 --> 01:01:55.209
Bye!

01:01:55.211 --> 01:01:57.378
Can we see the video?

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:58.980
Ah, not a chance, kid.

01:01:58.982 --> 01:02:02.083
Well, maybe Lila and I
can see it.

01:02:02.085 --> 01:02:03.851
I'm 11, you know.

01:02:03.853 --> 01:02:07.188
Yeah. Well, yeah.

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:08.990
I mean, as soon as I get a copy,

01:02:08.992 --> 01:02:10.758
you guys can see it.

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:14.329
Who wants to go to the Ridge
and hunt for coyotes?

01:02:15.432 --> 01:02:16.898
Let's go!

01:02:22.705 --> 01:02:25.340
We're doing a race.

01:02:26.842 --> 01:02:28.810
Look what I found!

01:02:31.046 --> 01:02:35.350
Oh. Look coyote vomit!

01:02:35.352 --> 01:02:37.852
Well, good.
I was getting hungry.

01:02:37.854 --> 01:02:42.657
Slightly better
than your mother's cooking.

01:02:42.659 --> 01:02:46.594
Oh, gross! Come on.

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:49.931
Let's keep exploring. Let's go.

01:03:18.861 --> 01:03:22.263
So why don't you try
something natural, like,

01:03:22.265 --> 01:03:23.631
you know, Melatonin?

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:26.434
Yeah, like,
I tried the Melatonin.

01:03:26.436 --> 01:03:28.669
But the Xanax is the only thing

01:03:28.671 --> 01:03:31.973
that actually calms me down
enough to fall asleep.

01:03:31.975 --> 01:03:35.410
So I thought maybe
I could just get

01:03:35.412 --> 01:03:37.678
a couple more months of that.

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:41.249
Any recent illnesses,

01:03:41.251 --> 01:03:44.051
severe cold, sore throat?

01:03:44.053 --> 01:03:45.319
Nope.

01:03:45.321 --> 01:03:46.654
When was your last period?

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:51.125
Uh... Well,
it was before the tour. So...

01:03:51.127 --> 01:03:54.662
Today's the 27th.

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:57.064
When did the tour
actually begin?

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.668
Six weeks ago.

01:04:06.742 --> 01:04:10.645
Okay. Well, Hayley,

01:04:10.647 --> 01:04:13.581
you are pregnant again.

01:04:13.583 --> 01:04:15.583
Congratulations.

01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:22.857
This is good, right?

01:04:22.859 --> 01:04:24.125
Yeah. Uh...

01:04:24.127 --> 01:04:28.696
It's just that my husband
has had a vasectomy.

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:33.034
Well, they don't always work.

01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:36.971
Studies say 1 in 2,000.

01:04:36.973 --> 01:04:38.673
Really?

01:04:38.675 --> 01:04:43.478
No more Xanax. No booze.
No cigarettes.

01:04:58.828 --> 01:05:03.130
Mommy, Benjy hitted me.

01:05:03.132 --> 01:05:05.800
But Cody started it.

01:05:08.238 --> 01:05:09.971
Hey, Benjy, no.

01:05:24.152 --> 01:05:25.920
Hi, you're home early.

01:05:29.258 --> 01:05:31.292
Um...

01:05:31.294 --> 01:05:34.228
You know, I shouldn't have
looked at this. But...

01:05:36.465 --> 01:05:38.399
Are you pregnant?

01:05:41.737 --> 01:05:43.905
Looks like it.

01:05:46.141 --> 01:05:48.676
The stick was blue.

01:05:48.678 --> 01:05:50.978
See, I thought you
didn't want another kid.

01:05:52.681 --> 01:05:55.049
Yeah, you thought that.
But you never asked me.

01:05:55.051 --> 01:05:57.718
Just like you never consulted
me about the vasectomy.

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.587
I told you I was
thinking about it.

01:05:59.589 --> 01:06:00.855
You were all for it.

01:06:00.857 --> 01:06:02.657
Yeah, but then you just did it.

01:06:07.629 --> 01:06:10.698
But you know it's, like,

01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:13.534
a 1 in 2,000 chance.

01:06:13.536 --> 01:06:15.269
It's a borderline miracle.

01:06:15.271 --> 01:06:17.805
Maybe it's meant to be.

01:06:17.807 --> 01:06:20.808
Maybe we should just
embrace our destiny.

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:23.978
When are you due?

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:28.616
I have no idea. I'm going
to call the doctor tomorrow.

01:06:28.618 --> 01:06:32.820
To be honest, I was just--

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:36.357
I was so in shock I didn't
even pay attention.

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:43.764
But it could be good, right?

01:06:43.766 --> 01:06:46.167
Have another little monster
running around.

01:07:11.593 --> 01:07:13.661
Morning. Delivery.

01:07:24.506 --> 01:07:26.774
Thank you.

01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:31.078
Why am I the last to know?

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:33.814
Come on, Carter.
It's from Annie.

01:07:33.816 --> 01:07:37.385
You know we have to
strategize a little bit.

01:07:38.453 --> 01:07:40.721
Okay.

01:08:11.554 --> 01:08:13.054
Uh-huh.

01:08:13.056 --> 01:08:16.023
Finally you answer.
What the fuck is going on?

01:08:16.024 --> 01:08:19.660
You sent me a baby gift?
How did you know?

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:21.062
And how did this happen?

01:08:21.064 --> 01:08:23.029
I mean, you said
you used protection.

01:08:23.032 --> 01:08:24.865
Those things
rip sometimes, Annie.

01:08:24.867 --> 01:08:27.100
You were pretty wild.

01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:28.602
All it takes
is a tiny, little hole.

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:32.038
Nothing's foolproof.
It's like 1 in 2,000?

01:08:33.774 --> 01:08:35.542
Where did you get that number?

01:08:35.545 --> 01:08:36.944
Hey, for dinner tonight

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:38.479
I picked up these
organic baby artichokes.

01:08:38.481 --> 01:08:40.346
The twins'll love 'em
'cause you peel--

01:08:40.349 --> 01:08:42.515
You're fucking kidding me,
right?

01:08:42.518 --> 01:08:43.884
You don't understand.

01:08:43.886 --> 01:08:45.219
You're no longer
welcome in my house.

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:47.755
Don't stay that, Hayley.

01:08:47.756 --> 01:08:48.788
You have to leave him.

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:51.892
Oh, Jesus, Enzo.

01:08:51.894 --> 01:08:53.828
I can't talk to you anymore.

01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:57.398
Do not call me again.
Do you understand?

01:08:57.399 --> 01:08:58.765
Do you understand?

01:08:58.768 --> 01:09:01.868
Yes. I understand.

01:09:06.073 --> 01:09:08.809
Hey, so I was just
about to call you.

01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:12.011
The label flipped out
over the new song.

01:09:12.014 --> 01:09:14.582
Annie, I screwed up.

01:09:14.584 --> 01:09:17.084
I fucked up really badly.

01:09:17.086 --> 01:09:20.054
Why? What's wrong?

01:09:20.055 --> 01:09:22.055
How long will it take
you to get here?

01:09:22.058 --> 01:09:23.924
I'm turning the car
around right now.

01:09:23.926 --> 01:09:25.392
I was just about to come over.

01:09:25.394 --> 01:09:27.461
Okay.

01:09:31.299 --> 01:09:33.901
I mean, I was just--

01:09:33.903 --> 01:09:36.437
I was torn up.

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:38.339
You know, the critics
were in my head.

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:43.210
And I thought that I couldn't do
any good work without Jack.

01:09:43.212 --> 01:09:45.845
So you fucked Enzo
to get your Mojo back.

01:09:45.848 --> 01:09:48.415
I totally get it.
It's okay.

01:09:48.417 --> 01:09:50.885
Yeah, I mean...

01:09:50.886 --> 01:09:52.219
I got inspired again.

01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:54.121
Because you're riding the beast.

01:09:54.122 --> 01:09:56.357
You've opened up Pandora's box

01:09:56.359 --> 01:09:59.860
and you're facing
joy and horror head on.

01:09:59.862 --> 01:10:01.495
Sweetie, every single artist--

01:10:01.497 --> 01:10:03.931
They have affairs because
it fuels their creativity.

01:10:03.933 --> 01:10:07.001
Look at Woody Allen
and Bruce Springsteen.

01:10:07.003 --> 01:10:09.336
And... Picasso.

01:10:09.338 --> 01:10:10.437
For God sakes, Picasso--

01:10:10.439 --> 01:10:11.972
Every time
he had a new mistress,

01:10:11.974 --> 01:10:13.474
he started a new
freaking art movement.

01:10:13.476 --> 01:10:14.542
I'm pregnant.

01:10:17.946 --> 01:10:19.947
Oh, shit.

01:10:22.651 --> 01:10:24.318
It's okay.

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:26.420
It's not like you mowed down
a deaf kid while texting.

01:10:26.422 --> 01:10:29.223
This is fixable. Um...

01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:31.325
You know you don't have
to go through with it.

01:10:31.327 --> 01:10:34.094
I could talk to Enzo.
I can be very discrete.

01:10:34.096 --> 01:10:36.430
Discrete?
Annie, he's obsessed.

01:10:36.432 --> 01:10:38.799
I have to get him
out of my life.

01:10:38.801 --> 01:10:40.467
He sent a bassinet to the house

01:10:40.469 --> 01:10:42.169
the day after I found
out I was pregnant.

01:10:42.171 --> 01:10:44.205
I didn't even tell him.
I mean, how does he know?

01:10:44.207 --> 01:10:46.774
You think he bugged
my cell phone or something?

01:10:46.776 --> 01:10:48.375
Can you do that?

01:10:48.377 --> 01:10:50.578
I'm sure--I'm sure
they have an app for that.

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:55.115
He has no boundaries.

01:10:55.117 --> 01:10:57.318
We didn't even do
a background check on him.

01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:59.286
Yeah, because we thought
he was amazing.

01:10:59.288 --> 01:11:00.588
He is amazing.

01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:03.190
I mean, he's a genius.

01:11:03.192 --> 01:11:06.260
- And what genius isn't twisted?
- Uh-huh.

01:11:06.262 --> 01:11:09.163
I mean, my brother
was a fucking nutbag.

01:11:09.165 --> 01:11:11.799
Maybe I'm being too paranoid.

01:11:11.801 --> 01:11:13.467
I really thought that

01:11:13.469 --> 01:11:15.569
he was going to be the one
to take us to the next level.

01:11:15.571 --> 01:11:17.872
I thought that too.

01:11:17.874 --> 01:11:19.940
I mean, you know,
I've always wanted

01:11:19.942 --> 01:11:23.077
to headline
Madison Square Garden.

01:11:23.079 --> 01:11:25.512
And--and score films

01:11:25.514 --> 01:11:29.216
and make a fucking
opera on the moon.

01:11:29.218 --> 01:11:33.854
You know, I wanted to make
really dangerous music.

01:11:33.856 --> 01:11:36.523
And I felt that with Enzo.

01:11:36.525 --> 01:11:38.092
You know, I was fierce,

01:11:38.094 --> 01:11:42.329
teetering on the edge of something.

01:11:42.331 --> 01:11:44.632
Here.
Oh, you're pregnant.

01:11:44.634 --> 01:11:46.400
Right.

01:11:50.605 --> 01:11:56.176
Okay. Okay.
This is what we're going to do.

01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:01.448
You're going to walk this edge
for a little while longer.

01:12:01.450 --> 01:12:04.718
We lay down enough tracks
to put together an album.

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:07.521
And then if you still
want me to, I cut the chord.

01:12:08.657 --> 01:12:10.124
Just like that?

01:12:10.126 --> 01:12:11.825
Pretty much.
I'll call the lawyer tonight

01:12:11.827 --> 01:12:13.327
and I'll make sure
that you're protected.

01:12:13.329 --> 01:12:17.665
And I'll spin off
the dark prince.

01:12:17.667 --> 01:12:18.899
I'll get him his own deal.

01:12:18.901 --> 01:12:21.235
And he will be
so busy with that,

01:12:21.237 --> 01:12:22.469
he won't have time
to munch your box

01:12:22.471 --> 01:12:25.306
let alone ruin your life.
Yeah?

01:12:27.642 --> 01:12:31.245
I will meet with him tomorrow,
give him some Annie rules,

01:12:31.247 --> 01:12:34.381
turn him into a well-behaved,
willing mistress, okay?

01:12:34.383 --> 01:12:36.517
- Okay.
- I'll be here for you.

01:12:37.652 --> 01:12:38.752
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay.

01:12:38.754 --> 01:12:40.754
- All right.
- Thanks.

01:12:40.756 --> 01:12:42.423
I'm so sorry about Enzo.

01:12:42.425 --> 01:12:44.491
It's okay.

01:12:44.493 --> 01:12:46.493
- Uh...
- Yeah.

01:12:46.495 --> 01:12:49.363
I told Carter that
you sent the bassinet.

01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:50.864
Okay. Shit.

01:12:50.866 --> 01:12:52.266
What?

01:12:52.268 --> 01:12:54.468
When I rolled up earlier

01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:56.003
and he was digging
in the garden,

01:12:56.005 --> 01:12:58.872
he thanked me,
then he mumbled something

01:12:58.874 --> 01:13:00.808
about being the last to know.

01:13:00.810 --> 01:13:02.476
And that's all that happened?

01:13:02.478 --> 01:13:04.611
That's all he said.
But then I said,

01:13:04.613 --> 01:13:06.714
I had no idea what
he was talking about.

01:13:06.716 --> 01:13:08.849
But it's fine.

01:13:08.851 --> 01:13:10.951
I--I can fix that.

01:13:10.953 --> 01:13:13.220
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:14.922
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:13:14.924 --> 01:13:16.623
- Bye, thank you.
- Bye.

01:13:22.630 --> 01:13:26.333
Uh, Camila, will you help me
move this into the guest room?

01:13:26.335 --> 01:13:28.002
Yes.

01:13:28.004 --> 01:13:30.437
You can leave that right there.

01:13:31.973 --> 01:13:37.077
Uh, Annie, didn't know they were
going to deliver it so quickly.

01:13:37.079 --> 01:13:38.345
That's why she was
caught off guard

01:13:38.347 --> 01:13:39.680
when you asked her about it.

01:13:39.682 --> 01:13:41.482
Well, that's one way
to explain it.

01:13:41.484 --> 01:13:44.685
- What do you mean?
- Exactly what I said.

01:13:44.687 --> 01:13:47.654
But, hey, we're all
just standing on a big rock

01:13:47.656 --> 01:13:49.590
hurling through space.

01:14:17.185 --> 01:14:18.519
Did you put the whiskey in?

01:14:18.521 --> 01:14:21.121
A whole shot.
Just like you showed me.

01:14:21.123 --> 01:14:22.523
Okay.
I need it.

01:14:22.525 --> 01:14:26.393
I thought you couldn't have
any more babies.

01:14:26.395 --> 01:14:28.495
You know what, bud?
I think it would be better

01:14:28.497 --> 01:14:30.964
if your mom explained
that to you.

01:14:30.966 --> 01:14:34.601
Well, it's complicated, buddy.

01:14:34.603 --> 01:14:36.870
But, um,

01:14:36.872 --> 01:14:41.842
sometimes the doctors think that
you can't have any more babies.

01:14:41.844 --> 01:14:44.211
You know, sometimes
they make mistakes.

01:14:44.213 --> 01:14:46.513
And this time they were wrong.

01:14:48.116 --> 01:14:52.453
Um...
yeah, no. Okay.

01:14:52.455 --> 01:14:55.222
You guys have a bit more food
and you can have a cookie.

01:14:57.826 --> 01:15:00.594
What?

01:15:03.498 --> 01:15:05.132
Um...

01:15:05.134 --> 01:15:07.534
Annie, she--

01:15:07.536 --> 01:15:10.304
She drove off the side of
Mulholland on her way home.

01:15:10.306 --> 01:15:14.141
They suspect foul play.

01:15:18.113 --> 01:15:21.315
And she said
that she didn't make it.

01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:25.219
Well, I'm going to go
to the hospital.

01:15:25.221 --> 01:15:28.388
You know, I said she's dead.

01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:32.926
And her sister's coming down
from Berkeley tomorrow.

01:15:32.928 --> 01:15:36.230
You and Enzo can go over then.

01:15:43.104 --> 01:15:45.806
Are you leaving?

01:15:45.808 --> 01:15:47.608
Uh...

01:15:47.610 --> 01:15:49.510
Sorry.

01:15:54.616 --> 01:15:56.517
Can I help you?

01:15:56.519 --> 01:15:58.485
Um, no.
I think it's best if you leave,

01:15:58.487 --> 01:16:00.087
and I'll call you tomorrow.

01:16:00.089 --> 01:16:01.889
Yes, miss.

01:16:08.863 --> 01:16:12.499
Hey, guys. Uh...

01:16:12.501 --> 01:16:15.002
You guys go brush your teeth.

01:16:15.004 --> 01:16:18.205
And I'm going to meet you in
the bathroom in a minute, okay?

01:17:23.738 --> 01:17:25.939
Carter?

01:17:38.486 --> 01:17:40.587
You've been bad.

01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:53.767
Carter?

01:18:00.975 --> 01:18:03.277
Stop.

01:18:04.112 --> 01:18:05.512
Stop.

01:18:05.514 --> 01:18:07.814
I need to tell you something.

01:18:09.384 --> 01:18:11.018
You know,

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:14.821
I interview real interesting
characters all the time.

01:18:14.823 --> 01:18:19.826
Sexy women in bars, hotel rooms,
trying to impress me.

01:18:19.828 --> 01:18:22.129
And I could've fucked
anyone of 'em.

01:18:22.131 --> 01:18:25.866
Do you know how many times
I've cheated on you?

01:18:25.868 --> 01:18:28.302
Huh?

01:18:28.304 --> 01:18:30.771
Not once.

01:18:33.241 --> 01:18:36.643
And now you're having
another man's baby!

01:18:36.645 --> 01:18:39.646
And you brought him
into our home!

01:18:39.648 --> 01:18:42.482
He played with our
fucking kids!

01:18:42.484 --> 01:18:46.787
Okay. Listen. Listen. Please.
Please, listen.

01:18:46.789 --> 01:18:49.489
I just...

01:18:50.425 --> 01:18:52.893
I just--when the album failed,

01:18:52.895 --> 01:18:55.929
I was just--I was--
I was torn up, you know.

01:18:55.931 --> 01:18:57.464
And I'm, like--

01:18:57.466 --> 01:19:00.100
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

01:19:00.102 --> 01:19:03.236
Would you be sorry if
you hadn't gotten caught?

01:19:03.238 --> 01:19:05.539
I wanted to trust you.

01:19:05.541 --> 01:19:09.376
But right under my nose.
What a fuck--what a fool!

01:19:09.378 --> 01:19:11.111
The big crime writer Carter.

01:19:11.113 --> 01:19:13.880
And I'm sure you guys were
laughing the entire time.

01:19:13.882 --> 01:19:15.115
No! No, not at all.

01:19:16.885 --> 01:19:18.719
Listen, I fucked up really badly.

01:19:18.721 --> 01:19:23.323
But please just help me fix it.
Help me be better.

01:19:23.325 --> 01:19:24.991
I'll do anything.

01:19:24.993 --> 01:19:26.660
Anything? No, you've
already done anything.

01:19:26.662 --> 01:19:29.696
Okay?
So just move.

01:19:31.099 --> 01:19:32.432
- Please?
- Move!

01:19:32.434 --> 01:19:35.268
Move!
Move so I can finish this!

01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:37.437
Why are you doing this now?

01:19:37.439 --> 01:19:40.273
Are you burying something?

01:19:40.275 --> 01:19:42.008
What did you do to him?

01:19:43.244 --> 01:19:45.145
Say his name?

01:19:45.147 --> 01:19:47.414
Did you hurt him?

01:19:50.118 --> 01:19:53.553
You care more about him
than your own fucking family?

01:19:53.555 --> 01:19:55.155
- Huh?
- No! That's not what I mean.

01:19:55.157 --> 01:19:57.391
You'd better get the
fuck away from me!

01:19:57.393 --> 01:20:00.494
Go! Get out of here!
Go!

01:20:06.434 --> 01:20:08.402
Hello?

01:20:10.705 --> 01:20:13.507
Evie, Carl,
it's your neighbor Hayley.

01:20:13.509 --> 01:20:15.942
I need your help.

01:20:15.944 --> 01:20:17.244
Hello?

01:20:17.246 --> 01:20:19.780
I'm sorry about what my
kids did to your dog.

01:20:19.782 --> 01:20:21.148
Can I please use your phone?

01:20:26.921 --> 01:20:30.557
Evie? Carl?

01:20:30.559 --> 01:20:32.392
Well, well, well.

01:20:32.394 --> 01:20:34.261
This is a surprise.

01:20:34.263 --> 01:20:37.230
I wasn't expecting anyone.

01:20:37.232 --> 01:20:39.132
Why are you here?

01:20:39.134 --> 01:20:44.104
I rented this place so I could
help out with the baby.

01:20:46.375 --> 01:20:48.975
Where did Evie and Carl go?

01:20:48.977 --> 01:20:52.345
Oh, they wanted to travel abroad.

01:20:52.347 --> 01:20:54.748
I found the house on Craigslist.

01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:58.585
I could not believe it
when I saw the address.

01:20:58.587 --> 01:21:00.620
Our little fuck shack.

01:21:00.622 --> 01:21:05.158
Enzo, I have a husband,
and I have children.

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:08.995
Not for much longer.
The husband part that is.

01:21:10.198 --> 01:21:12.165
What did you do?

01:21:12.167 --> 01:21:17.170
I chopped off the lime tree
roots on this side of the fence.

01:21:17.172 --> 01:21:19.940
Made the tree lean over.

01:21:19.942 --> 01:21:23.310
Whoo. Carter got all
worked up about it.

01:21:23.312 --> 01:21:26.646
Watch this.

01:21:34.088 --> 01:21:35.288
Ahh.

01:21:35.290 --> 01:21:38.091
Dug his own grave.

01:21:38.093 --> 01:21:39.993
Goochie goo.

01:21:39.995 --> 01:21:43.730
Oh, Hayley,
don't feel too bad for him.

01:21:43.732 --> 01:21:45.866
I might've saved your life.

01:21:45.868 --> 01:21:49.669
I just heard him yelling at you.

01:21:52.373 --> 01:21:55.542
Yeah, you're right.

01:21:55.544 --> 01:21:58.211
He's an asshole when he's drunk.

01:22:00.781 --> 01:22:03.216
Could've just divorced him.

01:22:03.218 --> 01:22:06.620
Then I wouldn't have to go
through with all this.

01:22:06.622 --> 01:22:11.191
But love makes you crazy.

01:22:11.193 --> 01:22:13.593
Right?

01:22:13.595 --> 01:22:15.529
Oh, check this out.

01:22:15.531 --> 01:22:20.033
A 1960s tube stereo.
Mint condition.

01:22:20.035 --> 01:22:22.269
That's amazing.

01:22:22.271 --> 01:22:23.837
It's about the music.

01:22:23.839 --> 01:22:26.473
You've always wanted
to headline the garden.

01:22:26.475 --> 01:22:28.808
Haven't you? Huh?

01:22:33.681 --> 01:22:35.382
Oh, the place is a mess.

01:22:35.384 --> 01:22:37.484
I was going to hang some drapes.

01:22:37.486 --> 01:22:39.853
Here, don't--

01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:47.694
Cool, huh?

01:22:47.696 --> 01:22:51.598
These baby monitors
have extraordinary range.

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:52.999
Twins are fine.

01:22:54.302 --> 01:22:56.002
Yeah, they sound happy.

01:22:56.004 --> 01:23:00.273
I cannot wait
to meet our little prodigy.

01:23:00.275 --> 01:23:03.710
So you can hear everything
we're saying over there?

01:23:03.712 --> 01:23:08.848
Including your little
conversation with Annie

01:23:08.850 --> 01:23:12.352
about how I have no boundaries.

01:23:12.354 --> 01:23:15.255
And you wanted to be rid of me.

01:23:16.857 --> 01:23:18.525
No.

01:23:18.527 --> 01:23:22.762
I just got freaked out, okay?

01:23:22.764 --> 01:23:25.398
I got freaked out.
Then we went outside

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:26.800
and we talked about it more.

01:23:26.802 --> 01:23:29.703
And I realized
that I want to be with you.

01:23:29.705 --> 01:23:32.772
I want to create with you.
I have to.

01:23:38.913 --> 01:23:43.483
Music is just a starting point,

01:23:43.485 --> 01:23:45.785
the genesis.

01:23:48.022 --> 01:23:52.225
That is cause for a drink.

01:23:55.696 --> 01:23:57.998
You sent that gift?

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.668
Oh, yeah. I kind of
liked that fan boy's style.

01:24:01.670 --> 01:24:04.337
So I carried it on
after we got home.

01:24:04.339 --> 01:24:07.407
This is for you.

01:24:07.409 --> 01:24:11.177
Enzo, a Martini?

01:24:12.413 --> 01:24:14.614
Bad daddy.

01:24:14.616 --> 01:24:16.416
Baby!

01:24:16.418 --> 01:24:18.918
It's okay.

01:24:20.721 --> 01:24:22.856
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

01:24:22.858 --> 01:24:27.427
How about some OJ?

01:24:27.429 --> 01:24:30.964
Well, I think I should probably
get back to the kids.

01:24:30.966 --> 01:24:34.968
Don't worry.
I've got it all covered.

01:24:38.739 --> 01:24:40.607
Oh, listen.

01:24:40.609 --> 01:24:43.209
I remixed "half of me."

01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:46.780
It's a duet now.

01:24:46.782 --> 01:24:51.051
I'm channeling Jack.

01:24:51.053 --> 01:24:53.953
<i>♪ Baby, no, no, no</i>

01:24:53.955 --> 01:24:58.792

01:25:27.522 --> 01:25:29.255
what's wrong?
Are you okay?

01:25:29.257 --> 01:25:32.559
I--I just drank that
juice way too fast.

01:25:32.561 --> 01:25:33.827
I have a little
morning sickness.

01:25:33.829 --> 01:25:35.061
Where's the bathroom?

01:25:35.063 --> 01:25:37.163
Uh, use the one
in the master suite.

01:25:37.165 --> 01:25:38.398
No, no.
Don't go in there.

01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:40.867
Left turn. Left turn.

01:25:40.869 --> 01:25:45.105
Just know that everything
I've done, I've done for us.

01:25:52.346 --> 01:25:54.380
I guess Evie and Carl
didn't have

01:25:54.382 --> 01:25:57.283
enough frequent flyer Miles
to make it to Europe.

01:25:57.285 --> 01:25:58.651
Whoops.

01:25:58.653 --> 01:26:00.453
I'll be out in a minute.

01:26:00.455 --> 01:26:02.655
Hayley?

01:26:02.657 --> 01:26:04.057
Hayley, let me in.

01:26:04.059 --> 01:26:06.192

01:26:32.486 --> 01:26:33.987
Carter?

01:26:33.989 --> 01:26:38.024
I can't move my legs.

01:26:42.863 --> 01:26:45.965
Camila, help us, please.

01:26:45.967 --> 01:26:49.068
Help me get him out of here.

01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:52.338
I need to check on the children.

01:26:53.641 --> 01:26:55.942
What the fuck
Camila!

01:26:59.079 --> 01:27:02.549
A whole shot,
just like you showed me.

01:27:02.551 --> 01:27:05.185
Oh, God.
She's with Enzo.

01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:08.121
Go. We have to go.
Come on.

01:27:08.123 --> 01:27:12.525
<i>♪ Where did you go, my mystery ♪</i>

01:27:17.198 --> 01:27:18.531
Come on.

01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:21.968
Mother?

01:27:21.970 --> 01:27:23.837
Go. Go. Go. Go.

01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:29.175
Mother?

01:27:32.446 --> 01:27:35.515
Okay. Come on.

01:27:35.517 --> 01:27:36.950
Let's go. Come on.

01:27:36.952 --> 01:27:38.852
I'm tired.

01:27:40.754 --> 01:27:42.555
Buckle up.

01:27:43.791 --> 01:27:46.559
Aah!

01:27:51.398 --> 01:27:53.266
Mommy?

01:27:53.268 --> 01:27:54.701
Mommy?

01:27:54.703 --> 01:27:56.970
Mother?

01:27:57.905 --> 01:28:00.340
Mother?

01:28:00.342 --> 01:28:03.509
Run inside and hide for mommy.
Okay? Up the stairs.

01:28:03.511 --> 01:28:05.311
Off you go.

01:28:05.313 --> 01:28:07.947
Aah! Ugh!

01:28:12.786 --> 01:28:15.221
Get away from him!

01:28:20.327 --> 01:28:21.461
The baby!

01:28:21.463 --> 01:28:24.664
I'm not having
your fucking baby!

01:28:35.309 --> 01:28:37.710
No!

01:28:37.712 --> 01:28:39.879
Ugh!

01:28:39.881 --> 01:28:43.182
You wanted us just
as much as I did!

01:28:48.722 --> 01:28:50.857
Aah!

01:28:50.859 --> 01:28:54.127
No!

01:28:56.530 --> 01:28:59.299
My mother could've
raised all the kids!

01:28:59.301 --> 01:29:04.671
Yes. And we could be free
to create like we should be.

01:29:04.673 --> 01:29:06.506
Ugh.

01:29:22.990 --> 01:29:24.958
Jack.

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:29.095
Aah!

01:29:29.097 --> 01:29:30.997
You fucking killed him!

01:29:30.999 --> 01:29:32.165
I had to!

01:29:32.167 --> 01:29:35.101
I loved Jack!

01:29:36.303 --> 01:29:38.705
But Jack didn't love me back!

01:29:50.617 --> 01:29:53.286
Shh.
Not like you did.

01:29:54.621 --> 01:29:56.422
Not like you did!

01:29:56.424 --> 01:29:57.857
Aah!

01:29:57.859 --> 01:29:59.993
My hand!

01:30:17.378 --> 01:30:19.245
Carter!

01:32:08.922 --> 01:32:10.857
Hey.
I just came from the house.

01:32:10.859 --> 01:32:13.693
And your parents have
everything under control.

01:32:13.695 --> 01:32:15.728
The boys are fine.

01:32:15.730 --> 01:32:17.797
They miss you.

01:32:17.799 --> 01:32:20.733
How are you feeling?

01:32:22.469 --> 01:32:25.371
Well...

01:32:25.373 --> 01:32:29.876
Because of the fight,

01:32:29.878 --> 01:32:32.812
I'm not pregnant anymore.
So...

01:32:34.815 --> 01:32:37.984
I brought your mail.

01:32:37.986 --> 01:32:41.254
Wow. You picked
a real psychopath.

01:32:41.256 --> 01:32:45.391
They've tied a total of six
murders to him and his mother.

01:32:51.865 --> 01:32:55.568
They still haven't found
Camila, right?

01:32:58.205 --> 01:33:00.673
No. But they will.

01:33:00.675 --> 01:33:03.342
And until they do,

01:33:03.344 --> 01:33:05.945
I'll have security
at the house 24/7.

01:33:08.348 --> 01:33:13.319
So--so you're in here
one more night, right?

01:33:15.055 --> 01:33:17.356
But when you get out...

01:33:18.992 --> 01:33:21.827
I guess I should just keep
staying at the hotel.

01:33:24.231 --> 01:33:26.332
I think that would be best.

01:33:28.735 --> 01:33:30.203
Okay.

01:33:33.340 --> 01:33:36.209
I know that I have a lot
of growing up to do.

01:33:36.211 --> 01:33:38.578
I really...

01:33:41.215 --> 01:33:43.583
I'm sorry.

01:33:43.585 --> 01:33:45.585
I'm sorry. You should rest.
I'll go.

01:33:59.333 --> 01:34:01.067
It's okay.

01:34:01.069 --> 01:34:04.503
It's okay. You take
all the time you need, baby.
