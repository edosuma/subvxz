00:08.879 --> 00:12.497
Oh, hey! My leg braces!

00:12.499 --> 00:13.999
Hey, my leg... Oof!

00:14.001 --> 00:16.585
I can't... oof... Walk without... ow...

00:16.587 --> 00:19.170
My leg braces!

00:19.172 --> 00:25.034
Oh, Mister...

00:43.780 --> 00:44.661
Good boy!

00:44.745 --> 00:46.054
S02E04
Shevenpucker

00:47.668 --> 00:50.869
Tommy, your breakfast is read... Ooh!

00:50.871 --> 00:54.255
Hi, Mom. Something terrible happened.

00:54.257 --> 00:55.173
Oh, my gosh!

00:55.175 --> 00:56.458
- Hi, Dad.
- Huh?

00:56.460 --> 00:58.710
- So, last night...
- Morning, everybod...

00:58.712 --> 00:59.844
Ooh!

00:59.846 --> 01:02.931
Everybody stop falling down and listen!

01:02.933 --> 01:04.965
Somebody stole my leg braces.

01:06.303 --> 01:09.521
Sheriff, it's Goodman.
The leg braces, they're gone.

01:09.523 --> 01:11.106
- Here you go, Tommy.
- Oh.

01:11.108 --> 01:14.025
I wish there was a real
superhero around here

01:14.027 --> 01:15.276
to stop crimes.

01:15.278 --> 01:18.980
There was once a superhero...
Super Hero Guy.

01:18.982 --> 01:21.219
He lived in that mansion by the cliffs.

01:21.387 --> 01:22.095
Really?

01:22.158 --> 01:24.575
Welp, Sheriff says there's
a metal thief on the loose.

01:24.638 --> 01:25.240
Oh, no!

01:25.282 --> 01:27.706
And that's who
probably stole your leg braces.

01:27.708 --> 01:30.125
Mr. Pickles, let's find Super Hero Guy

01:30.127 --> 01:32.827
and see if he can get
my leg braces back.

01:41.388 --> 01:42.921
Well, this is the place.

01:42.923 --> 01:46.474
Oh, I guess Super Hero Guy
doesn't live here anymore.

01:46.476 --> 01:49.144
Super Hero Guy!

01:49.146 --> 01:51.012
Jeeping Jaspers!

01:51.014 --> 01:54.015
No. I'm just Sidekick Boy.

01:54.017 --> 01:56.685
Super Hero Guy is no longer a superhero.

01:56.687 --> 01:59.688
You see, many years ago,

01:59.690 --> 02:02.524
Super Hero Guy and I were
at the top of our game.

02:02.526 --> 02:04.576
- Help!
- Jeeping Jaspers!

02:04.578 --> 02:06.444
Super Hero Guy!

02:06.446 --> 02:09.698
But then Crime Man
set fire to a nursery!

02:09.699 --> 02:12.534
Crime Man strikes again!

02:12.536 --> 02:13.501
Help!

02:13.503 --> 02:14.619
Super Hero Guy!

02:14.621 --> 02:16.171
Saved all the babies. Here!

02:16.173 --> 02:19.424
One of the babies pulled his mask off.

02:19.426 --> 02:21.009
Phil?

02:21.011 --> 02:23.461
He always said a superhero

02:23.463 --> 02:25.547
must never reveal his true identity.

02:25.549 --> 02:27.015
- Help!
- I'm here. What is it?!

02:27.017 --> 02:29.684
Phil!
Can you carry this milk to the kitchen?

02:29.686 --> 02:31.386
Can you watch my cat this weekend?

02:31.388 --> 02:33.388
Noooooo!

02:33.390 --> 02:35.056
Uh...

02:35.058 --> 02:38.226
Is this story going anywhere?

02:38.228 --> 02:39.894
Yes.

02:39.896 --> 02:42.397
So... that's when he became depressed

02:42.399 --> 02:44.733
and started using drugs and alcohol.

02:44.735 --> 02:45.950
But that wasn't enough.

02:45.952 --> 02:47.869
Only one thing did it for him...

02:47.871 --> 02:51.406
Shoving Super Sour
Candy Balls up his butt.

02:51.408 --> 02:54.125
Oh!

02:54.127 --> 02:56.911
I feel super again!

02:56.913 --> 02:59.581
The Germans called it Shovenpucker.

02:59.583 --> 03:00.965
The candy was banned,

03:00.967 --> 03:04.669
but he was still able to
buy from back-alley dealers.

03:04.671 --> 03:06.137
When his money ran out,

03:06.139 --> 03:09.090
he started stealing
metal and recycling it

03:09.092 --> 03:12.927
so he can get more money
for his Shovenpucker habit.

03:14.815 --> 03:17.565
He keeps trying to
break in to our old cave

03:17.567 --> 03:19.651
and strip our gadgets for metal,

03:19.653 --> 03:22.103
so I installed this security system.

03:22.105 --> 03:26.191
Only my hand allows access. Come on!

03:26.193 --> 03:27.442
Whoa!

03:27.444 --> 03:29.160
Look at all this cool stu... oof!

03:29.162 --> 03:33.114
We were always at the forefront
of crime fighting technology!

03:33.116 --> 03:34.666
The portable phone!

03:34.668 --> 03:36.167
Calculator clock!

03:36.169 --> 03:37.619
Tights for men!

03:37.621 --> 03:39.287
But I've been developing something

03:39.289 --> 03:43.124
Super Hero Guy doesn't
even know about yet.

03:43.126 --> 03:45.343
Steel robo-suits!

03:45.345 --> 03:47.345
They give you super strength.

03:47.347 --> 03:49.631
Wow! What's that?!

03:49.633 --> 03:52.267
That's just an electrical outlet.

03:52.269 --> 03:53.384
Cool!

03:53.386 --> 03:54.853
Oh.

03:54.855 --> 03:58.606
But how do we get Super Hero
Guy to be a superhero again?

03:58.608 --> 04:00.441
Poggly joggerfiffles!

04:00.443 --> 04:01.943
He won't go to rehab.

04:01.945 --> 04:05.063
He's just too addicted.

04:05.065 --> 04:07.065
I know an idea.

04:10.787 --> 04:12.320
Gimme, gimme, gimme!

04:14.658 --> 04:16.156
Gimme, gimme, gimme!

04:30.557 --> 04:31.840
Huh?

04:31.842 --> 04:33.341
M-m-m-metal!

04:33.343 --> 04:34.342
Me-me-metal!

04:34.344 --> 04:35.727
Get back here.

04:37.180 --> 04:40.014
Metal! Get back here, metal.

04:40.817 --> 04:42.934
What? What?

04:42.936 --> 04:45.653
- Mr. Super Hero Guy?
- Huh?

04:45.655 --> 04:48.857
Even though you stole my leg braces...

04:48.859 --> 04:52.443
you're still my hero for
trying to save yourself.

04:52.445 --> 04:53.528
Oh.

04:53.530 --> 04:56.030
I promise to get better

04:56.032 --> 05:01.252
so I can be a superhero again.

05:01.254 --> 05:02.670
- Yay!
- Yay!

05:02.672 --> 05:05.623
Then you can use the
giant steel robo-suits

05:05.625 --> 05:08.343
Side Kick Boy has for
you when you're okay.

05:08.345 --> 05:10.845
Steel, you say?

05:12.299 --> 05:15.433
Oh!

05:15.435 --> 05:16.851
Bingo bongdodonkers!

05:16.853 --> 05:19.938
Now he can use my hand
to get into the cave!

05:19.940 --> 05:20.722
Huh?

05:20.724 --> 05:22.357
Chippaly zombers!

05:22.359 --> 05:27.562
I can get so
much Shovenpucker with this!

05:29.399 --> 05:30.732
Tibily tandlebibs.

05:30.734 --> 05:32.200
What do we do?!

05:32.202 --> 05:35.119
It's finally time for
you to be the superhero

05:35.121 --> 05:38.573
and defend the town from Super Hero Guy!

05:38.575 --> 05:40.124
Bingo crillipers!

05:40.126 --> 05:41.376
You're right!

05:41.378 --> 05:42.877
Ow!

05:42.879 --> 05:46.965
Crime Man strikes again!

05:50.387 --> 05:52.553
Oh!

05:52.555 --> 05:53.638
Ew!

05:53.640 --> 05:55.006
Here you go, kid!

05:55.008 --> 05:57.308
Aah!

05:57.310 --> 06:02.313
Wasoly wabble goshes.
I'll never be a superhero now.

06:02.315 --> 06:04.565
But we can still use your other hand

06:04.567 --> 06:08.102
to go get the other robo-suit,
so you can walk!

06:08.104 --> 06:11.022
Jibbily jingle fingers, you're right!

06:14.661 --> 06:16.110
Here!

06:16.112 --> 06:19.030
Uh, you could have opened it yourself.

06:19.032 --> 06:20.999
Jordan jinglebingo flurs!

06:21.001 --> 06:23.251
I am such a sidekick.

06:29.042 --> 06:29.958
Ooh!

06:29.960 --> 06:32.010
Time to go again.

06:32.012 --> 06:34.545
Oh! Better put a diaper on!

06:35.715 --> 06:36.848
Hey!

06:36.850 --> 06:39.467
Where'd my diapers go?!

06:39.469 --> 06:41.769
Oh!

06:42.272 --> 06:43.638
Wait!

06:43.640 --> 06:50.728
I can use this robo-suit
to get even more metal!

06:51.865 --> 06:53.982
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!

07:03.159 --> 07:04.492
Huh?

07:04.494 --> 07:05.877
Oh!

07:05.879 --> 07:10.498
Even more metal!

07:10.500 --> 07:12.467
Shovenpucker!

07:12.469 --> 07:16.471
Oh! That robo thing is trying
to steal that metal thingie!

07:16.473 --> 07:18.072
It's called a train bridge.

07:18.074 --> 07:19.590
Nuh-uh, it's a thingie!

07:19.592 --> 07:21.059
Yo, somebody help!

07:21.061 --> 07:23.811
Sounds like a job for me!

07:26.649 --> 07:28.433
Aaaaah!

07:28.435 --> 07:29.934
I'm not okay.

07:29.936 --> 07:31.019
- Hey!
- Whoa!

07:31.021 --> 07:32.570
You're putting people in danger!

07:32.572 --> 07:36.557
Now it's time for me
to be the superhero!

07:36.559 --> 07:38.326
Punch, kick, punch!

07:38.328 --> 07:39.410
Slap!

07:39.412 --> 07:43.164
Soon I'll have all the sour balls.

07:43.166 --> 07:46.868
Then I can make a sour
ball as big as the world!

07:46.870 --> 07:51.205
And then shove that up my butt!

07:51.207 --> 07:54.375
Shovenpucker!

07:56.046 --> 07:57.428
Oh, no!

07:57.430 --> 07:59.213
A thing is coming!

07:59.215 --> 08:04.969
And our last stop, everybody, is...
we're gonna die!

08:06.639 --> 08:08.356
If I can bend these tracks up,

08:08.358 --> 08:11.893
maybe I can slow the train
before it goes over the cliff!

08:14.931 --> 08:17.065
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme,
gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme,

08:17.067 --> 08:18.366
gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!

08:18.368 --> 08:19.400
What?

08:19.402 --> 08:21.452
Hey, come on! What are you doing, man?!

08:21.454 --> 08:24.405
I'm just trying to shove
sour balls up my butt!

08:24.407 --> 08:25.873
Aah! Stop compacting me, dog!

08:27.377 --> 08:30.411
Aah! Oh, I'm out!
I'm gonna go get some sour balls!

08:35.168 --> 08:38.336
Oh, no! My suit is falling apart!

08:39.339 --> 08:40.922
He's never gonna make it in time!

08:40.924 --> 08:42.423
Fribboling ginglesnoof!

08:42.424 --> 08:43.808
I can't watch!

08:43.809 --> 08:45.593
Aah! Damn!

08:45.595 --> 08:47.595
Couldn't you have just
closed your eyes?!

08:47.597 --> 08:48.813
Oh, mother-f...

08:49.766 --> 08:52.233
There, I did it!

09:00.493 --> 09:03.945
Oh, no! It's coming back this way!

09:03.947 --> 09:05.780
Uh, ha, whoa, whoa!

09:05.782 --> 09:12.036
Oh, no!
I'll never stop the trains in time.

09:46.739 --> 09:47.872
Oh.

09:47.874 --> 09:49.991
I did it! I stopped the train!

09:51.161 --> 09:53.911
Oh, Tommy, what are you doing here?

09:53.913 --> 09:56.714
Look, Mr. Pickles found my leg braces.

09:56.716 --> 09:58.382
- Oh!
- Good boy!

09:58.384 --> 10:00.501
But who stole the train bridge?

10:00.503 --> 10:02.670
That was the old Super Hero Guy.

10:02.672 --> 10:05.756
He stole it so he could
cash it for super sour balls

10:05.758 --> 10:07.308
that he could stick up his butt!

10:07.310 --> 10:08.759
Oh, okay, that make sense.

10:08.761 --> 10:13.064
But who was that hero in the
robo-suit who saved the day?

10:13.066 --> 10:14.932
Oh, I know who it was.

10:14.934 --> 10:16.400
It was Tom...

10:16.402 --> 10:20.321
A superhero must never
reveal his true identity.

10:20.323 --> 10:22.990
Oh, yep. Total sidekick.

10:36.039 --> 10:38.623
No! What have you done to me?!

10:38.625 --> 10:40.291
Hey, where's my butt at?

10:40.293 --> 10:43.461
I'm trying to shove some
sour balls up in there!

10:47.850 --> 10:49.050
Ow!

10:49.052 --> 10:51.269
Oh, there they go!
