00:02.200 --> 00:03.967
Woman: Whitney Williams, 22.
She went into convulsions

00:04.001 --> 00:05.869
on the "E" train...
in and out of consciousness ever since.

00:05.903 --> 00:08.868
I want a CBC and an EKG.
Any sign of drugs on her?

00:08.888 --> 00:11.273
Nothing. But at one point,
she said someone did this to her.

00:11.293 --> 00:13.723
Whitney, can you tell me what happened?

00:13.743 --> 00:15.144
Diamondback.

00:15.178 --> 00:16.878
[Monitor beeping]

00:16.912 --> 00:19.447
She's seizing. Push 4 milligrams Ativan.

00:19.482 --> 00:22.684
[Glass clinking]

00:23.418 --> 00:26.555
Friends,
thank you for coming on such short notice.

00:26.589 --> 00:29.057
Well, it's times like these
I'm reminded of Shakespeare,

00:29.091 --> 00:31.268
who wrote, "it's not in the stars".

00:31.288 --> 00:34.195
Ah, ah, ah, he also said,
"brevity is the soul of wit."

00:34.229 --> 00:35.396
So get to it, darling.

00:35.430 --> 00:37.069
Uh, okay.

00:37.089 --> 00:40.334
We just returned from the Hamptons, and...

00:40.368 --> 00:41.836
- We got married!
- We got married!

00:41.870 --> 00:43.838
Martha: Yes!

00:43.872 --> 00:45.708
[Both laugh]

00:47.275 --> 00:48.342
- W-why did you do that?
- You guys suck.

00:48.376 --> 00:49.510
- Hold... hold up.
- You cou...

00:49.544 --> 00:50.711
No, no, no, no, no...

00:50.745 --> 00:52.546
You guys jumped the broom
and didn't invite us?

00:52.581 --> 00:53.980
- It was spur-of-the-moment.
- Spur.

00:54.015 --> 00:55.316
Martha: Oh, and it was perfection.

00:55.350 --> 00:57.418
I mean, you should have been there.

00:57.452 --> 00:58.686
It was fire and love.

00:58.720 --> 01:00.588
And at one point,
there were all these doves

01:00.622 --> 01:01.922
- that just soared into the...
- Gram, gram...

01:01.956 --> 01:03.156
Maybe we don't rub it in. Into the...

01:03.191 --> 01:05.391
- Let's go get you another drink.
- Oh. Drink. Okay.

01:05.426 --> 01:06.426
Come on.

01:06.460 --> 01:07.627
Hold this.

01:09.463 --> 01:11.832
I am your maid of honor.

01:11.866 --> 01:13.233
I haven't had a carb in months,

01:13.267 --> 01:15.268
just in case I had to put
that damn dress back on.

01:15.302 --> 01:17.771
- And you look great.
- Save the flattery.

01:17.805 --> 01:19.005
Kate, you owe me dinner.

01:19.040 --> 01:20.373
I'm picking the restaurant,

01:20.407 --> 01:23.008
and we're ordering all the desserts.

01:23.043 --> 01:24.076
Okay.

01:24.111 --> 01:26.346
Oh, girl, you're married!

01:26.380 --> 01:27.380
Come here!

01:27.414 --> 01:29.014
[Both laugh]

01:29.416 --> 01:31.718
Aah! Ow.

01:32.722 --> 01:34.704
Guys.

01:35.589 --> 01:36.656
Guys, come on.

01:36.690 --> 01:38.290
No. We were really looking forward to this

01:38.324 --> 01:39.491
for a long time, too, Castle.

01:39.525 --> 01:41.060
We had a speech prepared and everything.

01:41.094 --> 01:42.461
Ohh, plus, we wrote that song.

01:42.495 --> 01:44.930
- Yeah. [Cellphone ringing]
- Seriously, you wrote a song?

01:44.965 --> 01:46.899
We're... we're planning a little reception.

01:46.933 --> 01:49.101
You guys could do the
song at the reception.

01:49.136 --> 01:50.702
- No song for you.
- You had your chance.

01:50.737 --> 01:53.338
Guys... We're gonna have to
cut the celebration short.

01:53.373 --> 01:54.473
There's been a murder.

01:54.507 --> 01:56.875
Really? We didn't get that call.

01:56.909 --> 01:59.311
Once again, not invited. Cheers.

01:59.345 --> 02:01.012
Fine.

02:01.046 --> 02:02.714
We'll meet you at the precinct.

02:02.749 --> 02:05.216
Well, it could have been worse.

02:05.251 --> 02:06.685
It still might be.

02:06.719 --> 02:09.220
I mean, who knows what they're
doing to our place right now?

02:09.255 --> 02:10.589
You hear what you just said?

02:10.622 --> 02:12.090
"Our place." Our. We're married.

02:12.124 --> 02:14.125
We're married. We did it, Mrs. Castle!

02:14.160 --> 02:16.060
[Chuckles] We certainly did, Mr. Beckett.

02:16.095 --> 02:17.461
Although this arguably isn't

02:17.496 --> 02:19.497
the most romantic post-wedding activity.

02:19.531 --> 02:21.833
Or perhaps it's fitting,
considering how we met.

02:21.867 --> 02:24.302
But you bring up an excellent point...
the honeymoon.

02:24.336 --> 02:27.571
Yes. About the exotic island getaway...

02:27.606 --> 02:29.440
I-it's gonna have to wait.

02:29.474 --> 02:31.609
- Why?
- Because when you went missing,

02:31.643 --> 02:34.244
I used up all of my vacation
days looking for you.

02:34.279 --> 02:35.646
So no honeymoon.

02:35.681 --> 02:37.948
Mm, not for a while, I'm afraid.

02:39.017 --> 02:42.220
So instead of Mai Tais... we get murder.

02:43.259 --> 02:44.495
Great.

02:44.515 --> 02:46.501
Nah, it'll be great.

02:47.192 --> 02:48.625
Dr. Neville: Whitney Williams.

02:48.659 --> 02:50.760
She went into convulsions,
then cardiac arrest.

02:50.795 --> 02:51.962
We couldn't bring her back.

02:51.996 --> 02:53.496
And her last words were "Diamondback"?

02:53.531 --> 02:54.865
- What does that mean?
- I have no idea.

02:54.899 --> 02:57.301
And she believed that she
was a victim of foul play.

02:57.335 --> 02:58.335
Yes, and so do I.

02:58.369 --> 02:59.669
We ran a full blood work-up,

02:59.704 --> 03:01.604
and it came back with
high traces of digoxin.

03:01.639 --> 03:03.105
Oh, that's a heart medication.

03:03.140 --> 03:04.774
Derived from the foxglove plant.

03:04.809 --> 03:06.309
According to our pathologist,

03:06.344 --> 03:10.146
this was un-purified digoxin,
taken directly from the plant.

03:10.180 --> 03:12.081
- It's lethal.
- So she was poisoned.

03:12.115 --> 03:15.251
A-any way to tell how long
ago she ingested the foxglove?

03:15.285 --> 03:17.486
We're estimating 10 to 14 hours.

03:17.520 --> 03:18.988
Have you contacted the next of kin?

03:19.022 --> 03:20.823
I thought you would want to handle that.

03:20.858 --> 03:23.860
This is her in-case-of-emergency card.

03:23.894 --> 03:26.495
Esposito: Thanks for coming in,
Mr. and Mrs. Dagmar.

03:26.529 --> 03:28.530
Well, since her mom passed, I suppose

03:28.565 --> 03:30.867
we're the closest thing to
family that Whitney has.

03:30.901 --> 03:33.336
She was our first Dagmar scholar.

03:33.370 --> 03:34.670
Dagmar scholar?

03:34.704 --> 03:36.304
We sponsor disadvantaged children,

03:36.339 --> 03:38.039
send them to the finest schools.

03:38.074 --> 03:41.677
The poisoning occurred
between 10 and 14 hours ago.

03:41.711 --> 03:43.779
Do you happen to know where Whitney was

03:43.813 --> 03:45.547
or who she was with at the time?

03:45.582 --> 03:46.582
No.

03:46.616 --> 03:48.417
The last time we saw her was a week ago

03:48.451 --> 03:49.918
when she came over for supper.

03:49.952 --> 03:52.921
Did she mention if she was
having problems with anyone,

03:52.955 --> 03:54.189
perhaps at work?

03:54.223 --> 03:55.690
She did say she was going to

03:55.724 --> 03:58.493
- take some time off from her internship.
- Do you know why?

03:58.527 --> 04:00.228
Her mother's death was recent.

04:00.263 --> 04:02.998
Whitney said she needed some
time to get over the loss.

04:03.032 --> 04:06.301
Does the word "Diamondback"
mean anything to either of you?

04:08.570 --> 04:09.771
No, I'm afraid not.

04:09.805 --> 04:11.706
Castle: Okay. "Diamondback."

04:11.740 --> 04:15.009
I've whittled it down to three
possibilities as to what that means

04:15.043 --> 04:17.111
and why Whitney would utter
it with her dying breath.

04:17.144 --> 04:19.947
And I'm sure that none of them
will be a waste of my time.

04:19.981 --> 04:22.417
Possibility number one... it's the password

04:22.451 --> 04:25.386
for a murderous underground
snake-handling fight club.

04:25.420 --> 04:27.721
Granted, that's probably not what it means,

04:27.755 --> 04:30.624
but it might be the basis
for my next Nikki Heat novel.

04:30.658 --> 04:33.093
Possibility number two... she was killed

04:33.128 --> 04:36.363
by the marvel character Diamondback,
whose special skill

04:36.398 --> 04:39.533
was throwing diamond-shaped
spikes filled with poison.

04:39.567 --> 04:42.035
Third possibility...
it's a dude ranch in Arizona.

04:42.069 --> 04:45.338
We struck out with the Dagmars,
but we found an e-mail

04:45.372 --> 04:48.141
to Whitney from a
Diamondback Old West Ranch

04:48.175 --> 04:50.544
confirming a two-week stay
in bunkhouse number 14.

04:50.578 --> 04:52.579
Old west dude ranch.
That's my number three.

04:52.613 --> 04:55.014
That's exactly what I was gonna say.
Good work, boys.

04:55.917 --> 04:56.950
You still suck.

04:56.984 --> 04:58.985
And you owe us for those tuxedo rentals.

04:59.019 --> 05:00.253
Right.

05:00.287 --> 05:02.755
So, she was on vacation
in Arizona for two weeks?

05:02.789 --> 05:04.723
- Yep.
- She go with anyone?

05:04.758 --> 05:07.760
No, but it looks like the whole
"city slickers" cowboy thing

05:07.794 --> 05:10.000
didn't really agree with her.

05:10.020 --> 05:12.231
Whitney cut her trip short.
After only three days there,

05:12.266 --> 05:14.199
she paid for a last-minute ticket change

05:14.233 --> 05:16.635
for an 8:00 a.m. flight out
of Phoenix this morning.

05:16.670 --> 05:20.238
This morning?
So she was poisoned in Arizona

05:20.273 --> 05:24.276
somewhere between 1:00
and 5:00 a.m. local time.

05:24.310 --> 05:26.411
And all indications are that
she left in a big hurry.

05:26.446 --> 05:28.681
She even forgot to turn
in her bunkhouse key.

05:28.715 --> 05:30.815
Okay, I need every detail
we can get on that place.

05:30.850 --> 05:32.284
Castle: Well, according to this,

05:32.318 --> 05:34.819
"Diamondback Old West Ranch
is a living history resort

05:34.854 --> 05:37.155
"where both staff and guests
dress in old west attire

05:37.190 --> 05:39.391
and engage in cowboy activities."

05:39.425 --> 05:40.959
This sounds pretty cool!

05:40.994 --> 05:43.795
Or not, considering Whitney
might have been poisoned there.

05:43.829 --> 05:46.698
Wait a minute...
if Whitney flew back today,

05:46.732 --> 05:49.066
then she was coming in
on the train from JFK

05:49.101 --> 05:50.502
when she had that seizure.

05:50.536 --> 05:53.671
But the only personal effect
that we found at the hospital

05:53.706 --> 05:55.940
was her purse, so where is her luggage?

05:55.975 --> 05:58.242
Maybe it was left in the subway
when the medics took her.

05:58.276 --> 06:00.011
Well, if something happened at that ranch,

06:00.045 --> 06:01.813
there might be evidence
of it in her suitcases.

06:01.847 --> 06:04.115
- I'll look into it.
- And I'll keep digging in her financials.

06:04.149 --> 06:05.983
Maybe there's somewhere
else she went in Arizona.

06:06.018 --> 06:07.618
And I'll touch base with the local sheriff

06:07.652 --> 06:09.987
and coordinate with him on the
investigation. Thanks, big boy.

06:10.022 --> 06:12.956
Look, detective [Sighs] the way I see it,

06:12.991 --> 06:14.754
this is not an Arizona matter.

06:14.774 --> 06:16.427
Sheriff, we have evidence

06:16.461 --> 06:18.795
that Whitney was poisoned
in your jurisdiction.

06:18.830 --> 06:21.197
No, what you have is speculation.

06:21.232 --> 06:24.167
She could have been poisoned
on the plane or at the airport.

06:24.201 --> 06:26.169
Hell, I wouldn't know where to begin.

06:26.203 --> 06:28.204
Well, I-I'm telling you where to begin...

06:28.239 --> 06:29.506
Diamondback Old West Ranch.

06:29.541 --> 06:33.043
Detective, you got to understand.
That resort...

06:33.077 --> 06:36.046
that's the lifeblood of
our little tourist town.

06:36.080 --> 06:38.648
- So this is political.
- No, it's personal.

06:38.682 --> 06:42.018
Look, I've got people here...
folks I grew up with...

06:42.053 --> 06:44.954
and I can't just go in and disrupt business

06:44.988 --> 06:47.390
until there's some concrete proof.

06:48.459 --> 06:50.860
I'm sorry.
Without the sheriff's cooperation,

06:50.894 --> 06:52.662
there's only so much we can do.

06:52.696 --> 06:54.664
So we're just gonna let
him get away with this?

06:54.698 --> 06:57.600
Kind of like how we let you get away
with not inviting us to the wedding?

06:57.634 --> 07:00.402
Well, at least you were
invited to the champagne toast.

07:00.437 --> 07:01.904
- Uh...
- Sorry, sir.

07:01.939 --> 07:04.574
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm sure it was Mr. Castle's fault.

07:04.608 --> 07:06.576
Now, regarding the case, I'll call the feds

07:06.610 --> 07:08.610
and see if they can
intercede on our behalf.

07:08.644 --> 07:10.412
Sir, that could take weeks.

07:10.447 --> 07:13.582
By then, any evidence or
witnesses could be long gone.

07:13.616 --> 07:16.751
Uh, excuse me, sir,
I checked Whitney's financials.

07:16.786 --> 07:18.187
She used a car service

07:18.221 --> 07:20.222
to get to the airport
in Arizona this morning.

07:20.256 --> 07:21.690
And I spoke with the driver.

07:21.724 --> 07:24.025
He said she seemed upset
when she left the ranch.

07:24.060 --> 07:26.628
Something happened there.
Yeah, but we have no way to investigate it.

07:26.662 --> 07:27.729
Wait.

07:28.764 --> 07:30.612
Maybe we do.

07:31.467 --> 07:34.035
- We do?
- Well, look at this place.

07:34.070 --> 07:35.704
I mean, it's got beautiful skies,

07:35.738 --> 07:38.880
wide-open spaces,
the thrill of the old west.

07:39.609 --> 07:42.543
What better place for
an impromptu honeymoon?

07:42.578 --> 07:45.113
For the investigation, of course.

07:45.147 --> 07:46.914
We could jump on a plane
and be there in a few hours.

07:46.948 --> 07:48.782
Castle, you cannot be serious.

07:48.817 --> 07:50.985
We can find Whitney's killer

07:51.019 --> 07:53.554
and have a honeymoon at the same time...
it's perfect.

07:53.589 --> 07:57.158
No, Castle. We are not having
a honeymoon at a dude ranch!

07:57.192 --> 07:59.159
Well, it...
then, it can be our cover story.

07:59.193 --> 08:00.494
We're a-a newlywed couple

08:00.528 --> 08:03.130
with a hankerin' for the wild frontier,
right?

08:03.164 --> 08:04.264
And, look, Beckett,

08:04.298 --> 08:06.500
I know you want to see justice brought

08:06.534 --> 08:08.669
to this young woman's killer.

08:08.703 --> 08:11.204
And this...

08:11.239 --> 08:13.870
this is the only way.

08:16.553 --> 08:20.524
I hate to say this,
but your husband may be right.

08:21.282 --> 08:24.310
This could be our best
shot at solving the case.

08:26.220 --> 08:27.487
Fine.

08:27.522 --> 08:28.955
Excellent.

08:28.989 --> 08:32.291
Saddle up, honey,
because we are honeymooning out west.

Oh. Whoa.

09:10.936 --> 09:13.660
Wow. It's like we rolled
right into a John Ford movie.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.484
- Thank you.
- Okay, there, hoss.

09:15.504 --> 09:17.656
Just remember we're here for a reason...

09:17.676 --> 09:19.336
to find Whitney's killer.

09:19.371 --> 09:20.471
Best honeymoon ever.

09:20.505 --> 09:21.787
[Squish] Ew.

09:21.807 --> 09:23.755
This is so not our honeymoon.

09:24.388 --> 09:26.343
I think in the old west,
that was a sign of good fortune.

09:26.378 --> 09:27.778
[Chuckles] Lucky me.

09:27.812 --> 09:31.048
Say, y'all must be the newlyweds!

09:31.082 --> 09:34.685
Well, welcome to the Diamondback
Old West Ranch, folks.

09:34.719 --> 09:37.388
They call me Gentleman James Grady,

09:37.408 --> 09:40.256
and I am the proprietor of
this here establishment.

09:40.291 --> 09:42.425
I-I am Rick. This is Kate.

09:42.460 --> 09:44.927
And may I just say, this place is amazing.

09:44.962 --> 09:46.478
Yeah, very authentic.

09:46.498 --> 09:49.632
Oh, that's what you jackeroos came for,
ain't it...

09:49.666 --> 09:52.469
the legend and, dare I say,
romance of the old west?

09:52.503 --> 09:55.037
Now, uh, these brochures in your hands

09:55.072 --> 09:58.108
detail all the activities
that we have to offer here,

09:58.142 --> 10:00.943
from cattle-driving to nature-walking.

10:00.978 --> 10:02.344
We got it all!

10:02.378 --> 10:04.546
And my friendly staff of ranch hands...

10:04.581 --> 10:06.181
uh, they're the ones in the red bandanas

10:06.216 --> 10:08.618
in the brochure and all around here...

10:08.652 --> 10:11.854
they will guide you through any
adventure your hearts desire.

10:11.888 --> 10:13.723
So, shall we begin?

10:13.757 --> 10:15.658
Actually, we just got in on the red-eye

10:15.692 --> 10:17.926
and were kind of hoping
to check in to our room.

10:17.960 --> 10:20.529
Hey, well, no problemo.
Uh, seeing as you're newlyweds,

10:20.563 --> 10:22.964
I upgraded you to a
suite in our grand hotel.

10:22.999 --> 10:26.268
- Oh, well, we're much obliged.
- Uh, sure are. But...

10:26.302 --> 10:29.438
we were looking for a
more authentic experience.

10:29.472 --> 10:33.442
And we're kind of hoping to stay
at one of the bunkhouse rooms.

10:33.476 --> 10:35.322
Whatever the little lady wants.

10:35.342 --> 10:37.612
I can see who wears the
10-gallon hat in your house.

10:37.647 --> 10:39.114
[Chuckles] [Laughs]

10:39.148 --> 10:41.716
Yeah. And, um, Mr. Grady,
I know that this sounds silly,

10:41.751 --> 10:45.053
but my lucky number is 14...
is that room available?

10:45.087 --> 10:46.254
Uh, Daisy Mae!

10:46.288 --> 10:48.823
D-Daisy Mae, w-we need you, dear!

10:48.858 --> 10:51.225
That's my missus. Uh, like yours,

10:51.260 --> 10:53.060
she runs the show here. [Chuckles]

10:53.094 --> 10:57.398
Uh, hon, uh, these lovebirds
want to stay in bunkhouse 14.

10:57.432 --> 10:58.732
Uh, is it vacant?

10:58.767 --> 11:00.434
Well, sure is, but why?

11:00.469 --> 11:02.637
It's a single room with a twin bed.

11:02.671 --> 11:04.639
Oh, that's okay. We're, uh we're cuddlers.
Yeah.

11:04.673 --> 11:06.774
Well, all righty, then. But first, folks,

11:06.808 --> 11:09.609
we got to get you out of
those bibs and tuckers.

11:16.584 --> 11:18.652

11:18.687 --> 11:20.387
[Footsteps] Oh.

11:22.323 --> 11:24.357
This is like three fantasies
coming true all at once.

11:24.392 --> 11:25.958
Only thing missing is...

11:25.993 --> 11:29.128
gentleman James, where do we get
the replica guns, like yours?

11:29.163 --> 11:31.631
Replica? Son, this is Arizona.

11:31.666 --> 11:33.132
It's open-carry.

11:33.167 --> 11:36.503
Say, do either of you two know
what's quicker than lightning?

11:36.537 --> 11:38.137
What?

11:52.019 --> 11:53.720
Well, yeah, if you grow up.

11:53.754 --> 11:55.254
It's all about practice,

11:55.288 --> 11:57.590
which you can do with one of our firearms

11:57.624 --> 11:59.925
available for purchase at our gift shop.

11:59.959 --> 12:01.927
In fact, why don't we mosey on over?

12:01.961 --> 12:03.929
Yeah, uh, Mr. Grady, you know what?
Maybe later.

12:03.963 --> 12:05.598
Right now, we're both a bit knackered,

12:05.632 --> 12:07.724
so we were hoping to go to our room.

12:09.184 --> 12:11.370
So glad you're staying with us.

12:11.404 --> 12:13.775
Much obliged, ma'am.

12:15.808 --> 12:17.809
Much obliged, ma'am.

12:20.546 --> 12:21.880
We were wrong.

12:21.914 --> 12:24.249
The key that Whitney had
with her wasn't her room key.

12:24.283 --> 12:25.751
Well, then, what does it go to?

12:25.785 --> 12:26.785
I don't know.

12:26.819 --> 12:28.253
Here's 14.

12:30.883 --> 12:32.315
Oh, wait.

12:32.335 --> 12:34.928
Whether we like it or not,
we are on our honeymoon,

12:34.948 --> 12:37.629
so we must act accordingly.

12:39.331 --> 12:41.232
Oh! [Laughing] Geez!

12:43.488 --> 12:45.270
Aah! [Laughs]

12:47.305 --> 12:48.762
Oh, yeah.

12:49.506 --> 12:51.103
So not our honeymoon.

[Sighs]

12:54.499 --> 12:55.712
Are you looking for disinfectant?

12:55.747 --> 12:58.983
Clues. Remember? Whitney was staying here.

12:59.017 --> 13:00.251
I highly doubt

13:00.285 --> 13:02.986
we're gonna find anything in
this room that can help us.

13:03.020 --> 13:04.887
Howdy, partner. [Chuckles]

13:07.469 --> 13:09.626
I don't know if it comes with the room,

13:09.661 --> 13:12.829
but there's a naked cowboy
shaving in our bathroom.

13:12.863 --> 13:14.557
I'm sorry, what?

13:15.767 --> 13:17.534
My fault. Forgot to lock the door.

13:17.568 --> 13:19.135
It's a Jack-and-Jill bathroom.

13:19.170 --> 13:20.937
I'm in the room on the other side.

13:20.971 --> 13:23.072
Oh! Okay. Uh, I'm Rick. This is Kate.

13:23.107 --> 13:25.141
We, uh, just checked in. Newlyweds.

13:25.176 --> 13:27.010
Oh, congratulations. I'm Tobias.

13:27.044 --> 13:28.511
H-hi. Wait, didn't Mr. Grady say

13:28.545 --> 13:30.680
that there was a woman
staying in our room before?

13:30.714 --> 13:32.081
Uh, yes.

13:32.116 --> 13:34.350
I'm surprised they let her
stay in so close with menfolk,

13:34.384 --> 13:36.051
considering the customs of the old west.

13:36.085 --> 13:37.520
Well, I guess when they found out

13:37.554 --> 13:39.188
me and her both enjoy chasing cowboys,

13:39.222 --> 13:40.523
they figured, "what the heck?"

13:40.557 --> 13:42.658
Uh, you know,
we're about to brew some coffee.

13:42.693 --> 13:43.826
Would you care for a cup?

13:43.860 --> 13:46.429
I like my coffee like I like my men...

13:46.463 --> 13:47.930
strong, black, and bitter.

13:47.964 --> 13:50.866
Ooh, you're fun!
I bet you and your old bunkhouse mate

13:50.900 --> 13:52.701
got into all sorts of trouble.

13:52.735 --> 13:54.703
Not me. But Whitney, on the other hand...

13:54.737 --> 13:56.839
now, don't get me wrong.
She's a sweetheart,

13:56.873 --> 13:58.506
but she's a bit of a hell raiser.

13:58.541 --> 13:59.774
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:59.809 --> 14:01.176
- How so?
- Okay, like, our first day here,

14:01.211 --> 14:03.078
we went on a horseback-riding tour.

14:03.112 --> 14:04.913
She snuck off in the middle of it.

14:04.948 --> 14:06.348
Get out. Where'd she go?

14:06.382 --> 14:08.150
Probably went to go hang
out with her ranch hand...

14:08.184 --> 14:10.151
one of the red-bandana boys that work here.

14:10.185 --> 14:12.520
She used to stay out with him all night,
every night.

14:12.555 --> 14:14.723
Sounds like I better keep
him clear of my missus.

14:14.757 --> 14:16.958
- Who was this Romeo?
- I don't know. She wouldn't say.

14:16.992 --> 14:20.528
She just said he was tall, dark,
and handsome... Oh, and married.

14:20.563 --> 14:22.163
Married?! Get out.

14:22.197 --> 14:24.332
- Yes.
- Ooh, I wonder if there was any trouble.

14:24.367 --> 14:26.033
I kind of think the reason
that we got this room

14:26.068 --> 14:27.301
is because Whitney left so early.

14:27.336 --> 14:29.436
She sure did... her last night here,

14:29.471 --> 14:31.572
she rolled in at 3:00 a.m., upset.

14:31.606 --> 14:33.807
- She woke me up with all her crying.
- What happened?

14:33.842 --> 14:36.043
That's what I said,
but she didn't want to talk about it.

14:36.078 --> 14:38.512
She left before the sun came up.
Didn't even say goodbye.

14:38.546 --> 14:40.547
Oh. [Inhales sharply] I'm late for chow.

14:40.582 --> 14:42.516
Thanks for the coffee. See y'all around.

14:42.550 --> 14:43.751
Okay. [Chuckles]

14:47.121 --> 14:48.522
An affair with a married man?

14:48.556 --> 14:50.391
Yes, and she was with him until 3:00 a.m.

14:50.425 --> 14:52.993
That's right in the middle of
her time-of-poisoning window.

14:53.027 --> 14:55.195
- We got to find this guy.
- But how? We're undercover.

14:55.229 --> 14:57.230
I can't just flash my badge
and get people to talk.

14:57.265 --> 14:59.900
Exactly, which is why we
don't approach this like cops.

14:59.934 --> 15:01.234
We approach this like writers.

15:01.269 --> 15:03.904
So we procrastinate and make stuff up?

15:03.938 --> 15:05.105
No.

15:05.139 --> 15:06.539
Well, yes. But no.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.108
In this particular instance,

15:08.142 --> 15:11.211
we approach the investigation
like writers by...

15:11.245 --> 15:12.712
doing research.

15:12.746 --> 15:15.047
Now, there are seven ranch
hands who fit the bill

15:15.081 --> 15:17.417
of tall, dark, and handsome,
but in order to figure out

15:17.451 --> 15:19.285
which one was fooling around with Whitney,

15:19.319 --> 15:21.554
we have to first determine
who of them are married.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.890
That means we need to go
on a wedding-ring search.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.792
And these are the possibilities.

15:25.826 --> 15:28.160
So I split their classes up between us.

15:28.194 --> 15:29.595
Whoa. Hold up.

15:29.630 --> 15:31.397
Harmonica for beginners? Cowboy saloon?

15:31.431 --> 15:33.265
How come you get all the cool activities,

15:33.300 --> 15:35.867
- and I get hog-tying?
- Because this was my idea.

15:35.902 --> 15:37.169
Though it will be a shame

15:37.203 --> 15:39.571
that we're spending the first
day of our honeymoon apart.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.907
Except we're not,
because this is not our honeymoon.

15:41.942 --> 15:43.475
Okay. Bye. [Cellphone ringing]

15:43.509 --> 15:45.144
Be safe.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.812
Hey, Ryan, how's it going?

15:46.846 --> 15:49.815
Oh, wonderful. In fact,
we were just discussing your nuptials.

15:49.849 --> 15:51.983
Not the actual event,
since neither of us were there.

15:52.017 --> 15:54.619
Guys, is this really why you're calling?

15:54.654 --> 15:55.654
Partly, yes.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.288
And we have news. Here's the good.

15:57.323 --> 16:00.559
MTA cameras show that Whitney's
bags were left on the subway.

16:00.593 --> 16:03.061
Here's the bad news...
they were stolen by a homeless man.

16:03.095 --> 16:04.162
But we put out a BOLO.

16:04.196 --> 16:05.563
Hopefully somebody will recognize him.

16:05.597 --> 16:07.231
Also,
Lanie found something during her autopsy.

16:07.266 --> 16:09.567
She found traces of a waxcovered cardboard

16:09.601 --> 16:12.503
under Whitney's nails and on
the waistband of her pants.

16:12.537 --> 16:14.905
Wax-covered cardboard...
like butcher paper?

16:14.940 --> 16:16.407
Lanie says it's too hard to tell.

16:16.442 --> 16:18.642
What about you and hopalong?
Learn anything?

16:18.677 --> 16:20.644
Uh, well, so far, it looks like our victim

16:20.679 --> 16:22.546
was having an affair with a married man.

16:22.581 --> 16:24.682
But the problem is,
his identity is a mystery.

16:24.716 --> 16:27.417
Well, speaking of mysteries,
we spoke with Whitney's friends.

16:27.452 --> 16:29.052
They said prior to her departure,

16:29.087 --> 16:31.856
she was spending a good deal of
time at the historical society.

16:31.890 --> 16:33.190
Do they know what she was doing there?

16:33.224 --> 16:34.792
Well, we're still looking into it, but...

16:34.826 --> 16:36.159
Okay, guys, I-I-I got to go.

16:36.194 --> 16:38.996
Hey, Kate.
Wait, are you going to hog-tying class?

16:39.030 --> 16:40.630
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Me, too.

16:40.664 --> 16:43.000
Oh, my God. We're gonna have so much fun!

16:43.034 --> 16:44.767
Yeah, we sure are.

16:44.802 --> 16:46.603
Hog-tying. Yee-haw.

16:46.637 --> 16:48.372
[Chuckles dryly]

16:48.406 --> 16:51.674
[Mid-tempo player piano music playing]

17:03.821 --> 17:04.854
No ring.

17:06.818 --> 17:08.816
One down.

17:10.777 --> 17:11.859
What'll it be, feller?

17:11.895 --> 17:13.996
I'll take, uh, coffin varnish.

17:14.031 --> 17:15.964
What? You know, gut-warmer.

17:15.999 --> 17:18.867
Base burner. Nose paint. Cowboy cocktail.

17:18.902 --> 17:20.328
What... what do y'all call whiskey here?

17:20.348 --> 17:21.738
Whiskey.

17:22.372 --> 17:24.640
[Whiskey pours]

17:31.147 --> 17:32.313
Ooh.

17:36.505 --> 17:39.655
Hey, mister. I sure could use your help.

17:39.689 --> 17:42.323
I'm looking for the Peacock boys.

17:42.358 --> 17:44.659
Well, I haven't seen them, marshal,

17:44.693 --> 17:47.462
but I'll, uh, keep an eye out. [Chuckles]

17:52.940 --> 17:56.637
You just gonna bat your eyes,
mister, or you gonna play?

17:56.672 --> 18:00.074
Oh, yeah. Hey, I'm a... I'm a sporting man.

18:00.108 --> 18:01.208
There we go.

18:01.242 --> 18:02.843
Hey, there, partner,
couldn't help but notice

18:02.878 --> 18:04.011
you got a ring on your finger.

18:04.046 --> 18:06.180
Just had mine put on. Newlywed.

18:06.214 --> 18:08.849
This isn't a ring. It's a noose.

18:08.884 --> 18:10.985
[All chuckle] That bad, huh? Ooh.

18:11.019 --> 18:12.887
Yeah, I suppose, uh, one woman

18:12.921 --> 18:15.389
for the rest of your life is a tall order.

18:15.423 --> 18:17.924
- What's your secret?
- You'll figure it out.

18:17.959 --> 18:19.193
Oh, come on. What...

18:19.227 --> 18:22.062
do you got a little
left-handed missus on the side?

18:22.097 --> 18:25.408
- I don't cheat on my wife, friend.
- Oh.

18:26.810 --> 18:28.635
Well, that's, uh, not what I heard.

18:28.669 --> 18:30.670
[Bell chiming]

18:33.753 --> 18:36.977
You no-good, mangy cur!
You got an ace up your sleeve!

18:37.011 --> 18:39.512
You know what we do with
card cheats in here, mister?!

18:41.115 --> 18:43.817
Hold it, boys! Hear them bells?

18:43.851 --> 18:46.452
It's high noon. That means it's show time.

18:46.487 --> 18:50.990
Take it out back.
Time for a good, old-fashioned gunfight.

18:51.024 --> 18:52.730
Yee-haw! [Cheers and applause]

18:59.933 --> 19:01.334
What do you know?!

19:01.368 --> 19:02.502
Huh? My wife send you?!

19:02.536 --> 19:03.902
Hey, I've never met your wife!

19:03.937 --> 19:06.571
Who told you I was a cheater?!

19:06.606 --> 19:08.273
Whitney did.

19:08.307 --> 19:10.308
Damn it!

19:10.343 --> 19:13.946
I knew it! Look, everything that
woman said to you was a lie!

19:13.980 --> 19:16.581
Ollie! What in tarnation?!

19:16.616 --> 19:17.916
Mister, are you okay?

19:17.951 --> 19:19.685
You thought that was real?

19:19.719 --> 19:22.820
Yes, Ollie! Up high!

19:22.855 --> 19:24.922
He... you asked him to throw you out?

19:24.957 --> 19:26.858
Yeah, like old-west style.

19:26.892 --> 19:28.092
Ollie's been fantas...

19:28.127 --> 19:30.295
he's all "yee-haw" and [Imitates gunfire]

19:31.697 --> 19:32.864
Well, all righty, then.

19:32.898 --> 19:35.328
As long as you're enjoying yourself.

19:38.971 --> 19:40.538
[Sighs]

19:40.572 --> 19:41.706
Damn.

19:41.740 --> 19:43.681
That could have cost me my job.

19:43.805 --> 19:45.368
Look, mister, I'm sorry.

19:45.388 --> 19:47.945
Save it. You want my silence?

19:47.980 --> 19:50.682
Tell me about Whitney.
What happened between you two?

19:50.716 --> 19:51.983
Look, she came on to me,

19:52.017 --> 19:54.351
started flirting, getting all handsy.

19:54.386 --> 19:57.254
A bunch of the boys saw us
and figured we hooked up,

19:57.289 --> 19:59.356
but we didn't... I swear it.

19:59.391 --> 20:01.659
In fact,
I think she was just after my ranch key.

20:01.693 --> 20:03.227
Ranch key?

20:03.261 --> 20:04.628
It's on a snake key chain.

20:04.663 --> 20:07.565
I think she picked it off me
when she was pawing at me.

20:07.599 --> 20:09.733
- What does the key open?
- The ranch shed.

20:09.767 --> 20:12.335
Wait a minute.
Y-you're saying that she stole your key

20:12.369 --> 20:14.763
to open the ranch shed.
What's in the shed?

20:14.783 --> 20:17.473
Nothing. Just ranch supplies.

20:29.353 --> 20:30.486
I don't get it.

20:30.521 --> 20:32.455
Why would Whitney steal
the key to this place?

20:32.489 --> 20:33.723
I don't know. But clearly,

20:33.757 --> 20:35.358
it has nothing to do with the affair.

20:35.392 --> 20:36.726
Right, so what was she after?

20:36.760 --> 20:39.061
Castle, do you remember how Lanie said

20:39.096 --> 20:41.764
that she found traces
of wax-covered cardboard

20:41.798 --> 20:44.567
under Whitney's nails and in her waistband?

20:44.602 --> 20:45.935
Yeah, so?

20:45.969 --> 20:48.804
So, you know what's wrapped
in wax-covered cardboard?

20:50.140 --> 20:51.510
Dynamite.

20:52.308 --> 20:54.443
She broke in here to steal sticks of these.

20:54.477 --> 20:56.545
Ranchers use dynamite to clear their land.

20:56.579 --> 20:58.728
What the hell was Whitney using it for?

21:02.686 --> 21:05.901
Is there any indication why
Whitney would steal dynamite?

21:05.921 --> 21:07.289
Beckett: Not yet, but Castle and I

21:07.323 --> 21:09.123
have been re-tracing every move she made,

21:09.158 --> 21:10.925
starting with that horseback-riding tour

21:10.959 --> 21:12.294
that she snuck away from.

21:12.328 --> 21:14.596
- Well, any idea where she was going?
- I asked around,

21:14.630 --> 21:16.964
and apparently, the trail that she took

21:16.999 --> 21:19.584
led to the native american reservation.

21:20.155 --> 21:22.703
Wait a minute...
it wasn't the yavapai reservation, was it?

21:22.737 --> 21:24.005
Yeah. How'd you know?

21:24.039 --> 21:25.472
The historical society.

21:25.507 --> 21:28.542
Whitney was looking up
obscure documents and maps

21:28.576 --> 21:29.877
from the late 18th, early 19th century.

21:29.912 --> 21:31.345
Yeah, most of them had to do

21:31.379 --> 21:33.948
with the construction of a dam
near the yavapai reservation.

21:33.982 --> 21:36.450
Well, did anyone know why she
was researching that area?

21:36.484 --> 21:38.652
No, but it's probably the reason she
went out there in the first place.

21:38.687 --> 21:41.154
But it doesn't explain why
Whitney needed dynamite

21:41.189 --> 21:42.356
or why she was poisoned.

21:42.390 --> 21:44.124
Look, it's all got to be related.

21:44.158 --> 21:46.393
Castle and I are headed
up to the reservation

21:46.428 --> 21:48.729
to get some answers... now.

21:48.763 --> 21:50.698
Uh, g-guys, I got to go.

21:50.732 --> 21:52.366
[Horse neighs]

22:00.074 --> 22:02.843
Whoa, whoa, there! Ho, ho.

22:02.877 --> 22:04.144
Hey, there!

22:04.178 --> 22:06.079
Beckett, meet the boys.
This one's Esposito.

22:06.113 --> 22:08.148
I'm calling the little one Ryan.
Are you ready?

22:08.182 --> 22:10.483
Uh, Castle,
when I asked you to find us a ride,

22:10.517 --> 22:11.984
I was thinking of something

22:12.018 --> 22:13.986
more along the lines of a pickup truck.

22:14.020 --> 22:17.590
The reservation's 15 miles away.
This is gonna take forever.

22:17.624 --> 22:20.059
Yeah, well, what can I tell you?

22:20.093 --> 22:22.829
Everything here's authentic old west.

22:26.699 --> 22:28.901
Really?

22:28.935 --> 22:30.402
Couldn't resist, huh?

22:30.436 --> 22:31.837
Just had to get a six shooter.

22:31.871 --> 22:35.574
Right? Isn't it great?
And it gets better.

22:35.608 --> 22:37.609
I got you one, too. It's a wedding gift...

22:37.643 --> 22:39.210
his-and-hers matching set.

22:39.245 --> 22:41.780
And who said romance dies after you say
"I do"?

22:41.814 --> 22:42.981
[Laughs]

22:43.015 --> 22:44.616
Esposito, Ryan!

22:44.650 --> 22:46.050
Hyah!

22:46.085 --> 22:47.385
Ooh!

22:57.609 --> 22:59.697
Whoa, whoa.

22:59.731 --> 23:02.267
Seriously,
you're rolling up to the reservation

23:02.301 --> 23:04.869
dressed like extras
from a Gene Autry movie?

23:04.903 --> 23:07.237
That's some real cultural insensitivity.

23:07.272 --> 23:09.973
Sorry, sir. We didn't mean any offense.

23:10.008 --> 23:12.877
We're... we're vacationing at Diamondback.

23:12.911 --> 23:14.144
Yeah, I figured that.

23:14.178 --> 23:16.213
I was just messing with you folks.

23:16.247 --> 23:17.214
Relax.

23:17.248 --> 23:18.749
[Both laugh] - He got me.
- Yeah.

23:18.784 --> 23:19.983
- Welcome.
- Whew.

23:21.419 --> 23:23.220
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm Rick.

23:23.254 --> 23:25.155
- Yes.
- This here is Kate.

23:25.189 --> 23:26.556
- Ooh.
- And we...

23:26.590 --> 23:28.158
are on our honeymoon.

23:28.192 --> 23:29.993
- Ain't we, honey?
- Yeah. We sure are.

23:30.028 --> 23:32.062
Um, so, we met a guest at Diamondback.

23:32.096 --> 23:33.230
Her name was Whitney.

23:33.264 --> 23:35.032
She said that she came out here,

23:35.066 --> 23:37.333
and she discovered some breathtaking views.

23:37.367 --> 23:39.836
Yeah, sure. I remember Whitney. Nice girl.

23:39.870 --> 23:42.271
She came out a few days
ago riding an appaloosa.

23:42.306 --> 23:44.841
But she wasn't interested in the scenery.

23:44.875 --> 23:47.844
Really? What was she, uh, interested in?

23:47.878 --> 23:50.580
Did it have anything to do with dynamite?

23:50.614 --> 23:51.815
Dynamite? No.

23:51.849 --> 23:54.283
She just had a question
about a yavapai word.

23:54.318 --> 23:56.919
- What word was that?
- Aha gah hel'lah.

23:56.954 --> 23:59.255
She wanted to know if it
could be misinterpreted.

23:59.289 --> 24:01.557
- Seems an odd question.
- Not really.

24:01.591 --> 24:04.193
Many of our words change
depending on the context.

24:04.227 --> 24:05.661
Aha gah hel'lah means "river,"

24:05.695 --> 24:07.229
but sometimes, it means "stream."

24:07.264 --> 24:10.031
Why would she want to know about that word?

24:10.066 --> 24:11.132
I have no idea.

24:11.167 --> 24:12.968
But Whitney was happy with my answer.

24:13.002 --> 24:14.470
She thanked me and left.

24:14.504 --> 24:16.572
And that was it? I don't get it.

24:16.606 --> 24:18.206
Yeah, well, I don't get

24:18.240 --> 24:21.810
newlyweds dressing up like
cowboys on their honeymoon,

24:21.845 --> 24:23.900
but I try not to judge.

24:26.357 --> 24:28.283
You know, the more we learn about Whitney,

24:28.317 --> 24:30.751
the less I understand
about what she was up to.

24:30.786 --> 24:32.787
Yeah, I mean, the historical society,

24:32.821 --> 24:34.822
the yavapai word, the dynamite...

24:34.857 --> 24:37.258
how does all of that add up
to someone poisoning Whitney?

24:37.293 --> 24:39.294
It just doesn't make sense.

24:39.328 --> 24:41.062
You know what else doesn't make any sense

24:41.097 --> 24:43.364
is we're married, and...

24:43.398 --> 24:44.765
we're not acting like it.

24:44.800 --> 24:47.167
What do you got in mind, cowboy?

24:47.202 --> 24:49.871
[Harmonica playing]

24:59.483 --> 25:01.248
Admit it. You're impressed.

25:01.282 --> 25:03.517
Yeah, you're right. I am.

25:03.551 --> 25:06.586
This is actually... kinda magical.

25:09.032 --> 25:13.400
To us, to the journey,
and to what lies ahead.

25:25.606 --> 25:28.241
What?

25:28.275 --> 25:29.776
You know...

25:30.269 --> 25:32.775
maybe this is our honeymoon.

25:34.781 --> 25:35.781
Hmm?

25:42.822 --> 25:44.790
[Cup clatters]

25:52.458 --> 25:54.166
Castle, don't move.

25:54.200 --> 25:55.734
Your wish is my command.

25:55.769 --> 25:58.637
No, I'm serious. Don't move an inch.

25:58.672 --> 26:00.873
[Rattling]

26:00.907 --> 26:01.874
[Gunshot] - Aah!

26:01.908 --> 26:03.442
[Horses neighing]

26:03.476 --> 26:06.178
Oh. No!

26:06.212 --> 26:08.613
No, no, no, no, no.

26:08.647 --> 26:10.582
Espo, Ryan, come back!

26:10.616 --> 26:13.218
Guys! No, come back!

26:13.252 --> 26:15.087
Ohh.
[Sighs]

26:15.121 --> 26:16.988
[Exhales sharply]

26:17.022 --> 26:19.324
[Sighs] Well, you were right before.

26:19.358 --> 26:21.425
This is so not our honeymoon.

26:30.985 --> 26:32.485
Well, thank goodness. [Chuckles]

26:32.519 --> 26:34.287
We were fixing to put together a posse

26:34.321 --> 26:35.922
to go searching for the two of you.

26:35.957 --> 26:38.024
Yeah, sorry, Mr. Grady.
We tried to call you,

26:38.059 --> 26:40.326
but we couldn't get a signal in the hills.

26:40.360 --> 26:42.798
Your horses came back hours ago.
What happened up there?

26:42.818 --> 26:45.164
We met a namesake of your ranch.

26:45.199 --> 26:46.832
Oh, a rattler. Yeah.

26:46.866 --> 26:48.867
Well,
why don't you mosey on over to the cantina

26:48.902 --> 26:51.471
and strap on a feed bag and get
some fresh jitter juice in you?

26:51.505 --> 26:52.871
Yeah, I think we'll do that.

26:52.906 --> 26:56.229
Yeah, just as soon as we get
on some fresh union suits.

26:58.112 --> 26:59.612
Yee-haw.

27:00.680 --> 27:02.315
Gates: You found our victim's suitcases?

27:02.349 --> 27:03.983
Esposito: Yes, sir... our BOLO got a hit

27:04.017 --> 27:06.619
on the homeless guy who
took them from the subway.

27:06.653 --> 27:08.220
Inside is Whitney's research

27:08.254 --> 27:10.889
and something we haven't seen before...
a letter.

27:10.924 --> 27:12.658
There was no return address,

27:12.692 --> 27:15.393
but it's got an Arizona
postmark dated 1992.

27:15.428 --> 27:16.996
A 20-year-old letter?

27:17.030 --> 27:20.745
"Slim, in care of Rebecca Doolin."
Jersey address.

27:20.765 --> 27:23.201
Yeah, we're hoping to track down Ms. Doolin
so we can get some answers.

27:23.236 --> 27:25.203
The letter's from a guy named Clyde.

27:25.238 --> 27:27.305
We assume that the photograph is him.

27:27.340 --> 27:30.041
It says here that Clyde was a
seasonal worker at Diamondback.

27:30.075 --> 27:32.210
Yeah, 20 years ago,
before the place was a resort.

27:32.245 --> 27:34.246
But here's the interesting part.

27:34.280 --> 27:36.380
In the letter, Clyde goes on about

27:36.414 --> 27:38.049
how he and a guy named Dutch

27:38.083 --> 27:40.652
were close to figuring out some big secret.

27:40.686 --> 27:41.853
What big secret?

27:41.887 --> 27:44.555
Ryan: It doesn't say, but Clyde wrote,

27:44.589 --> 27:46.724
"I just need a few more weeks.

27:46.759 --> 27:48.893
"Slim, Dutch, and I are so close.

27:48.927 --> 27:51.328
"It all comes down to a mistranslation

27:51.363 --> 27:53.697
- of a yavapai word."
- Let me guess.

27:53.731 --> 27:56.400
- Aha gah hel'lah.
- Yeah, how'd you know?

27:56.434 --> 27:59.136
It's the same word Whitney was
asking the yavapai elder about.

27:59.171 --> 28:00.604
Well, Clyde goes on to write,

28:00.639 --> 28:02.839
"I can hardly believe that one little,
old word

28:02.874 --> 28:05.008
"is the key to the secret
of the Peacock boys.

28:05.043 --> 28:08.712
As soon as I find it,
I'm coming on home to you. Love, Clyde."

28:08.746 --> 28:11.247
The Peacock boys... how do I know...

28:13.573 --> 28:14.905
They're wanted men.

28:14.925 --> 28:17.246
Cornelius and Percy Pea...

28:18.499 --> 28:19.690
cock.

28:19.724 --> 28:22.358
Hey, Ryan, any idea who those
people in the letter are?

28:22.393 --> 28:24.061
No,
but javi's trying to track down the lady

28:24.095 --> 28:25.162
who the letter was sent to.

28:25.196 --> 28:27.263
- I'll keep you posted.
- Yes, posted. K-keep...

28:27.298 --> 28:29.232
post... keep... keep... keep us po...

28:29.266 --> 28:30.433
thank you. Thank you, Ryan.

28:30.467 --> 28:32.235
Eyes back in their sockets, cowboy.

28:32.269 --> 28:33.936
- We got a murder to solve.
- Right.

28:33.970 --> 28:35.672
Now, who is this Clyde fellow,

28:35.706 --> 28:37.807
and why did our victim have his letter?

28:37.841 --> 28:40.577
And what does any of this have
to do with the Peacock boys?

28:40.611 --> 28:42.978
Good questions.
And I know who has the answers.

28:43.013 --> 28:44.580
You do?

28:44.614 --> 28:47.416
The same person who always
has the answers in westerns...

28:47.450 --> 28:49.218
the affable, all-knowing barkeep.

28:49.252 --> 28:50.785
Train robbers.

28:50.820 --> 28:53.655
Held up the Southern Pacific back in 1893.

28:53.690 --> 28:56.491
Made off with 50 bars
of U.S. treasury gold.

28:56.526 --> 28:57.992
Gold?

28:58.027 --> 28:59.728
24-carat A.U., feller.

28:59.762 --> 29:03.131
Them Peacock boys...
they outrun a whole squad of soldiers

29:03.165 --> 29:04.999
by traversing deadman's gorge.

29:05.034 --> 29:08.136
Two days later, they was gunned
down just outside of Phoenix.

29:08.170 --> 29:09.470
But the gold was gone.

29:09.504 --> 29:11.672
And no one knows anything about it?

29:11.707 --> 29:13.274
There were rumors.

29:13.308 --> 29:16.010
1947, the missionaries started writing down

29:16.045 --> 29:19.013
the old stories of the yavapai people.

29:19.048 --> 29:21.515
One of them was about black fox...

29:21.550 --> 29:24.418
just a kid,
abducted by them Peacock boys.

29:24.453 --> 29:25.886
Forced him to be their guide.

29:25.920 --> 29:28.589
But during their journey, they stopped,

29:28.624 --> 29:31.259
and they tied poor black fox to a tree

29:31.293 --> 29:32.760
just south of the river,

29:32.794 --> 29:35.529
and they rode off in
their gold-laden wagon.

29:35.564 --> 29:38.331
But when they returned...

29:38.366 --> 29:40.000
it was empty.

29:40.034 --> 29:42.269
The Peacock brothers stashed the gold.

29:42.303 --> 29:43.804
That's what everybody thought.

29:43.838 --> 29:45.705
When this story surfaced,
treasure hunters...

29:45.740 --> 29:47.274
they came a-coming.

29:47.308 --> 29:49.042
- Anybody ever find it?
- Nope.

29:49.077 --> 29:53.346
And that's why this is just
another legend of the old west.

29:53.381 --> 29:55.882
Castle: Whitney was after the gold.

29:55.916 --> 29:58.518
What if, when those missionaries
wrote down black fox's story,

29:58.552 --> 29:59.986
they wrote it down incorrectly?

30:00.020 --> 30:02.021
That yavapai word has two meanings,
remember?

30:02.055 --> 30:04.991
What if the Peacocks didn't
stash the gold near a river?

30:05.025 --> 30:07.126
What if they stashed it near a stream?

30:07.161 --> 30:08.227
Castle...

30:08.262 --> 30:10.963
Look at these maps from Whitney's research.

30:10.998 --> 30:14.633
In 1893, there was a small
stream north of the river.

30:14.668 --> 30:17.369
And then, in 1920, it was dammed off.

30:17.404 --> 30:18.671
Wait, that means all those years,

30:18.705 --> 30:19.939
everyone was looking for the gold

30:19.973 --> 30:21.473
- in the wrong place.
- In the wrong place!

30:21.508 --> 30:23.442
That's why Whitney needed the dynamite...

30:23.476 --> 30:25.577
to blast open
whatever hiding place it was in.

30:25.612 --> 30:28.079
But what do you do when you
discover 50 bars of gold...

30:28.114 --> 30:29.815
fly it home in your carry-on?

30:29.849 --> 30:31.750
'Course not. So she left it there.

30:31.785 --> 30:33.819
She went back to New York for help.

30:33.853 --> 30:35.721
But perhaps the killer caught on to her,

30:35.755 --> 30:37.122
poisoned her to silence her

30:37.156 --> 30:39.157
and to keep the gold for themselves.

30:39.192 --> 30:41.092
When Whitney went home, she was upset.

30:41.127 --> 30:43.561
Does that sound like someone
who'd just found gold?

30:43.595 --> 30:45.030
Okay.

30:45.064 --> 30:46.231
Mm, you got me there.

30:46.265 --> 30:48.733
But if Whitney was searching for the gold

30:48.767 --> 30:51.203
and the killer tracked her,
there could be clues.

30:51.237 --> 30:53.305
You keep assuming that the
gold's still out there.

30:53.339 --> 30:56.586
Don't forget... Clyde and Dutch were
looking for it. They might have found it.

30:56.606 --> 30:58.276
Not if they didn't have those
old maps that Whitney had.

30:58.311 --> 30:59.744
You just want to go after the gold.

30:59.778 --> 31:02.213
Of course I want to go after the gold!
It's gold!

31:02.247 --> 31:03.848
Okay, look.

31:03.882 --> 31:06.417
If we use Whitney's research,

31:06.452 --> 31:09.981
we may find Whitney's killer, too.

31:10.556 --> 31:13.254
Come on, Beckett. What do you say?

31:14.792 --> 31:18.528
Yeah, that's me. But I haven't
lived at this address in years.

31:18.563 --> 31:20.097
Rebecca, who is Slim?

31:20.131 --> 31:21.899
She was a friend of mine.

31:21.933 --> 31:23.367
Her real name's Virginia Williams.

31:23.401 --> 31:25.435
Wait,
did she have a daughter named Whitney?

31:25.470 --> 31:28.705
Well, Virginia was pregnant with
Whitney when she stayed with me.

31:28.740 --> 31:31.876
- Virginia was a real mess back then.
- How so?

31:31.910 --> 31:34.411
Knocked up, no money, no prospects.

31:34.445 --> 31:37.748
Virginia got so fed up with
getting letters like these,

31:37.782 --> 31:40.550
she finally wrote Clyde a
"dear John" letter and moved on.

31:40.585 --> 31:43.095
Wait, are you saying that Clyde
is Whitney's father?

31:43.115 --> 31:44.664
Mmhmm.

31:44.684 --> 31:47.034
Do you have any idea where Clyde is now?

31:47.054 --> 31:49.859
It's been 20 years. How would I know?

31:49.894 --> 31:53.029
Beckett: Whitney must have found
Clyde's letters after her mother passed.

31:53.063 --> 31:55.331
Yeah, and that's what started her quest.

31:55.366 --> 31:57.066
Now, according to the map...

31:57.101 --> 32:00.069
The stream used to be right around here...

32:00.600 --> 32:02.305
I think.

32:03.440 --> 32:04.874
Maybe.

32:05.159 --> 32:07.058
I-I don't know.

32:08.634 --> 32:10.165
Castle, what are you doing?

32:10.185 --> 32:12.648
I am tracking Whitney's path to the gold.

32:13.263 --> 32:15.737
And how are you doing that?

32:15.961 --> 32:18.058
By staring at the dirt.

32:18.368 --> 32:20.188
That's how they do it
in all the old westerns.

32:20.223 --> 32:22.357
Yes, because they're cowboys.
You're a New Yorker.

32:22.392 --> 32:25.093
- An easterner. A city slicker.
- Yes.

32:25.128 --> 32:27.262
And because I'm a city slicker,
I can tell you,

32:27.297 --> 32:29.264
with absolute certainty, Whitney was here.

32:29.299 --> 32:30.832
How? You don't know how to read tracks.

32:30.866 --> 32:32.801
[Chuckling] No, no,
but because I'm a New Yorker,

32:32.835 --> 32:35.437
I know how to read litter.

32:35.471 --> 32:37.105
Check this out.

32:37.140 --> 32:40.141
Charred wax-covered cardboard.

32:40.175 --> 32:42.944
Whitney must have detonated
the dynamite nearby.

32:42.978 --> 32:44.078
We're close.

32:45.815 --> 32:47.649
Ah. More there.

32:49.084 --> 32:50.785
Beckett, look at this.

32:53.255 --> 32:55.485
There's gold in them thar hills.

32:59.794 --> 33:01.762
You go first. Check for snakes.

33:03.432 --> 33:04.465
[Laughs]

33:04.499 --> 33:07.034
This place is old!

33:07.069 --> 33:08.436
This mine must have been abandoned

33:08.470 --> 33:10.137
before the Peacock boys stashed their loot.

33:10.172 --> 33:11.339
[Sighs] Slow down, Castle.

33:11.373 --> 33:13.073
- Just be careful.
- Are you kidding?

33:13.107 --> 33:15.208
There's treasure in here.
Whitney found the gold.

33:15.242 --> 33:18.445
Or Clyde found the gold and
split it with his buddy Dutch

33:18.480 --> 33:20.914
and simply abandoned Whitney and her mom.

33:20.949 --> 33:23.851
I'm absolutely positive
Clyde didn't find the gold.

33:23.885 --> 33:26.353
And how can you be so sure, huh?

33:26.387 --> 33:29.722
Because it's still here.

33:29.756 --> 33:33.393
For over a century, 50 ingots of pure gold

33:33.427 --> 33:37.397
have been trapped in this cold, dark tomb,

33:37.431 --> 33:40.633
waiting patiently to be rescued.

33:43.208 --> 33:45.037
You hear that, Beckett?

33:45.057 --> 33:46.405
Do you hear them calling?

33:46.439 --> 33:47.573
[Scoffs]

33:47.608 --> 33:50.676
Calling to me.

33:50.711 --> 33:53.312
Your wait is over, my golden friends.

33:53.346 --> 33:55.289
I'm here to save you.

33:55.883 --> 33:57.282
[Castle screams]

33:57.317 --> 33:58.677
Okay!

33:59.419 --> 34:00.888
That's not gold!

34:03.493 --> 34:06.118
- That's blunt-force trauma.
- Yep. And given this hat,

34:06.138 --> 34:08.623
I'm pretty sure I know who the victim is.

34:08.643 --> 34:09.946
- It's Clyde.
- Yep.

34:09.966 --> 34:11.232
Castle, do you think

34:11.266 --> 34:13.101
that Whitney came out here to find her dad?

34:13.135 --> 34:15.370
Well, that explains why she
was so upset when she left.

34:15.404 --> 34:18.223
You were right.
Clyde found the treasure years ago.

34:18.243 --> 34:20.358
Yeah, but then his buddy
Dutch double-crossed him.

34:20.378 --> 34:21.842
Dutch took the gold for himself,

34:21.862 --> 34:24.040
left his blood-stained shirt behind.

34:24.060 --> 34:25.646
And if he killed once, what's to stop him

34:25.681 --> 34:28.105
from killing again to protect his secret?

34:28.650 --> 34:30.818
Wait, if Whitney found her murdered father,

34:30.853 --> 34:32.887
why not just go straight to the sheriff?

34:32.920 --> 34:35.255
Why take the first flight home?

34:35.290 --> 34:38.599
To confront her father's killer.
Dutch was just his nickname.

34:38.619 --> 34:41.661
Castle, look.
There's a laundry tag on this shirt.

34:41.696 --> 34:44.598
It has the initials "P.D."

34:44.632 --> 34:46.405
Philip Dagmar.

34:47.101 --> 34:49.303
I had nothing to do with Whitney's death.

34:49.337 --> 34:51.237
Are you sure about that, Mr. Dagmar...

34:51.273 --> 34:53.349
or should we call you Dutch?

34:54.542 --> 34:55.942
We checked your phone records.

34:55.976 --> 34:57.977
There was a call from the ranch pay phone

34:58.012 --> 35:00.647
to your cellphone the
morning of Whitney's murder.

35:00.681 --> 35:02.749
Esposito: She called you, didn't she?

35:03.785 --> 35:05.852
What did she say?

35:05.887 --> 35:08.321
That she was flying home,

35:08.355 --> 35:09.956
and she needed to speak with me in person.

35:09.990 --> 35:11.757
Why didn't you tell us this before?

35:11.792 --> 35:14.760
- Because it makes me look guilty.
- You're right. It does.

35:14.795 --> 35:16.261
I bet you've still got connections

35:16.296 --> 35:17.629
in that one-horse town, don't you?

35:17.663 --> 35:18.696
Why would I kill Whitney?

35:18.731 --> 35:20.498
Because she knew about your secret, Dutch.

35:20.533 --> 35:22.667
We found Clyde's skeleton.

35:22.701 --> 35:26.738
The skeleton that you left when
you took those 50 bars of gold.

35:27.873 --> 35:29.674
Grady: So you're saying that the story

35:29.708 --> 35:32.143
about the Peacock boys
and the gold is true?

35:32.177 --> 35:34.178
Yeah, and someone found out the hard way.

35:34.212 --> 35:36.314
Well,
that's not gonna be good for business.

35:36.348 --> 35:37.782
Now, don't you worry none.

35:37.817 --> 35:40.217
All that nonsense is from long
before y'all bought the place.

35:40.252 --> 35:42.520
It's not gonna scare anyone off.
And I'll make sure of it.

35:42.555 --> 35:43.888
We appreciate that, sheriff.

35:43.923 --> 35:46.223
Jimmy, I sure could use the ranch's ATVs

35:46.258 --> 35:47.391
to get up to this mine.

35:47.426 --> 35:49.160
'Course. We got two of them.
They're all yours.

35:49.194 --> 35:51.562
Come on. I'll take you to them.

35:51.596 --> 35:53.965
Detective,
would you mind showing me the way?

35:53.999 --> 35:55.132
Not a problem.

35:55.167 --> 35:57.234
Try to stay out of trouble while I'm gone,
Castle.

35:57.269 --> 35:59.136
Where's the fun in that?

35:59.171 --> 36:01.305
Sounds like you had a hell of a day, son.

36:01.340 --> 36:05.008
Want to bend an elbow
and tell me all about it?

36:05.042 --> 36:07.143
Drinks are on me.

36:07.178 --> 36:10.380
I did the best I could for
Whitney all these years.

36:10.414 --> 36:13.350
But she wanted to find out
what happened to her father.

36:13.384 --> 36:16.653
God, I can't believe she found him.

36:16.688 --> 36:19.990
And when she did,
you knew exactly what to do, didn't you?

36:20.024 --> 36:23.994
- So you hired someone to poison her.
- No, I-I didn't kill Whitney.

36:24.028 --> 36:26.729
- But I think I know who did.
- Come on, Dutch. We know it was you.

36:26.763 --> 36:29.565
Clyde and I couldn't find the
location of the old stream.

36:29.600 --> 36:34.170
So we enlisted the help of
someone who grew up in the town.

36:34.205 --> 36:36.772
Clyde and I planned to turn in the gold

36:36.807 --> 36:39.880
and collect the finder's
fee from the treasury.

36:39.900 --> 36:42.277
But our new partner disagreed.

36:42.312 --> 36:44.213
They fought,

36:44.247 --> 36:46.616
and then Clyde fell, landed on a rock,

36:46.650 --> 36:48.551
and hit his head.

36:48.585 --> 36:50.419
He was dead in minutes.

36:50.453 --> 36:52.722
That's when I sold my soul...

36:53.428 --> 36:56.525
for 25 bars of gold.

36:57.226 --> 37:00.195
Mr. Dagmar, who was your other partner?

37:06.302 --> 37:07.302
- Smooth.
- I know.

37:07.337 --> 37:09.971
[Cellphone rings] Oh. Excuse me.

37:10.006 --> 37:12.206
Ah.

37:12.241 --> 37:14.609
Ryan, they didn't have mobile
phones in the old west,

37:14.644 --> 37:16.778
so you're kind of killing
the vibe and my buzz.

37:16.812 --> 37:19.113
[Chuckles]
Ryan: Listen, is Beckett with you?

37:19.148 --> 37:20.448
No, why?

37:20.482 --> 37:22.250
I've been calling and texting.
She's not answering.

37:22.284 --> 37:23.484
Oh, she's on an ATV.

37:23.519 --> 37:25.754
She probably can't hear her phone.
What's up?

37:25.788 --> 37:28.056
There was a third partner. He's the killer.

37:28.090 --> 37:29.757
The sheriff?

37:29.791 --> 37:32.193
No, it's James Grady.

37:41.636 --> 37:44.669
Well, I guess this is goodbye.

37:49.062 --> 37:50.526
Grady, stop.

37:58.620 --> 38:01.054
Who's gonna make me, son? You?

38:15.670 --> 38:18.405
L-look, Grady, you, uh...

38:18.440 --> 38:20.208
you kill me, that's just another murder

38:20.242 --> 38:21.743
you're gonna have to answer for.

38:21.777 --> 38:24.178
Not if I make it to Mexico first.

38:24.213 --> 38:26.080
I can't let that happen.

38:26.115 --> 38:27.181
[Chuckles]

38:27.216 --> 38:29.851
You got sand, boy. I'll give you that much.

38:29.885 --> 38:33.287
Why don't you just sit on
down and have another drink?

38:33.321 --> 38:35.356
Come on, son.

38:35.390 --> 38:36.490
Think of your wife.

38:36.524 --> 38:38.425
I am.

38:38.460 --> 38:39.993
Fine.

38:40.027 --> 38:42.963
If you got a hankering for a residence

38:42.997 --> 38:44.365
in the bone orchard,

38:44.399 --> 38:46.356
I'll accommodate you.

38:48.800 --> 38:50.737
Any last words?

38:50.772 --> 38:52.139
Yeah.

38:52.173 --> 38:54.741
If I survive this...

38:54.776 --> 38:57.754
I'm giving this place a
scathing review on yelp.

39:32.946 --> 39:33.979
Hey!

39:35.448 --> 39:37.516
I, uh... I guess you got Ryan's message.

39:37.550 --> 39:39.651
Castle, I leave you alone for five minutes,

39:39.686 --> 39:41.186
and you end up in a showdown?

39:41.220 --> 39:43.121
Yeah, well...

39:43.155 --> 39:46.103
Good thing I married the, uh,
fastest gun from the east.

39:50.347 --> 39:52.759
Given that Whitney checked
in under her own name,

39:52.779 --> 39:55.427
Grady may have been onto her
from the moment she arrived.

39:55.447 --> 39:57.702
Probably didn't take him long
to figure out why she came.

39:57.736 --> 40:00.504
And when he did,
he must have followed her to the mine

40:00.539 --> 40:02.506
- and seen what she discovered.
- Yep. On the morning she left,

40:02.541 --> 40:05.699
Grady made specific Internet
searches on foxglove poisoning.

40:05.719 --> 40:07.679
Sounds like you got him dead to rights,
sheriff.

40:07.713 --> 40:09.881
Well, with what you did here, we sure do.

40:09.915 --> 40:11.682
Detective, I'm in your debt.

40:11.716 --> 40:13.618
Y'all take care of yourselves.

40:13.652 --> 40:14.852
Thank you, sheriff.

40:14.886 --> 40:16.154
[Engine turns over]

40:16.188 --> 40:19.790
Well, I guess we cleaned up this town.

40:20.507 --> 40:23.001
Yeah, I reckon we did.

40:23.907 --> 40:27.264
So guess it's, uh, time to go home.

40:33.004 --> 40:35.472
Esposito: No, no, but, well,
you know what really gets me

40:35.506 --> 40:38.475
is that they said they only
invited immediate family.

40:38.509 --> 40:40.610
What? We're not family?

40:40.645 --> 40:41.779
More like poor relations.

40:41.813 --> 40:43.047
And we're probably the reason

40:43.081 --> 40:44.502
that they fell in love in the first place.

40:44.522 --> 40:45.202
Right?

40:45.222 --> 40:48.585
You know,
I've been listening to your bellyaching

40:48.619 --> 40:50.387
for the last few days, and I have to ask...

40:50.421 --> 40:52.021
what the hell's wrong with you two?

40:52.056 --> 40:53.856
Come on, sir. It doesn't bother you?

40:53.891 --> 40:55.925
You really want to know what I think,
detectives?

40:55.959 --> 40:58.828
I think that the two of
you should stop whining

40:58.862 --> 41:01.864
like two little schoolgirls who
weren't invited to the dance

41:01.899 --> 41:04.633
and be happy that your friends,
your very dear friends,

41:04.668 --> 41:06.435
have found a way to make it work,

41:06.469 --> 41:09.538
especially after all the hell
those two have been through.

41:09.573 --> 41:11.153
Now, that's what I think.

41:12.489 --> 41:15.178
Well, when you put it that way...

41:15.212 --> 41:17.746
Yeah, I mean, I guess in some opinions,

41:17.766 --> 41:20.249
- we have been kind of jerks about it.
- I guess.

41:20.283 --> 41:22.050
Yeah. You have.

41:22.085 --> 41:24.720
But if you're interested,

41:24.754 --> 41:28.377
there might be something you
could do to make it up to them.

41:31.361 --> 41:33.361
Well, Rick, sorry to see you guys go.

41:33.395 --> 41:36.323
Oh, yeah, me, too, but,
uh, it couldn't be helped.

41:37.800 --> 41:38.934
Beckett: Hey, there, cowboy.

41:38.968 --> 41:40.969
Where you off to in such a hurry?

41:40.989 --> 41:42.086
Beckett, what are you doing?

41:42.106 --> 41:43.972
We're gonna miss our flight.
You got to be in the office by morning.

41:44.006 --> 41:46.307
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, you do.

41:46.342 --> 41:48.710
- You don't have any personal days left.
- Actually, I kind of do.

41:48.745 --> 41:50.778
For our wedding gift, Ryan and Esposito

41:50.812 --> 41:55.116
have both agreed to give me two
of their vacation days each.

41:55.150 --> 41:56.951
- They did?
- Yeah.

41:56.985 --> 41:58.519
So, now we have four days

41:58.554 --> 42:03.258
to do whatever... we... want.

42:04.143 --> 42:05.493
And you want to stay here?

42:05.527 --> 42:06.894
Of course I want to stay.

42:06.928 --> 42:09.429
After all, this is our honeymoon.

42:11.166 --> 42:14.168
Oh, wait. We're gonna still go
to that island getaway, right?

42:14.202 --> 42:16.049
- Yes. Absolutely.
- Okay, good.
