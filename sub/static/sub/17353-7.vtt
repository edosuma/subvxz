WEBVTT

00:02.768 --> 00:04.570
WHAT --
WHAT WAS THAT SHADOW?

00:04.605 --> 00:05.670
WHAT?

00:05.705 --> 00:07.607
- OUTSIDE?
- YES.

00:07.642 --> 00:09.474
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

00:09.509 --> 00:12.478
I SAW A SHADOW
WALKING TOWARDS ME.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.681
SHE WAS PUSHED
DOWN THE STAIRS.

00:14.716 --> 00:15.847
MY GOD.

00:15.882 --> 00:17.650
ARE YOU TRYING
TO GET OUR ATTENTION?

00:20.920 --> 00:24.956
WHAT IS WALKING AROUND
THIS PROPERTY?

00:24.991 --> 00:29.329
THEY FOUND THE BONES
OF A 7-FOOT-TALL INDIAN.

00:31.831 --> 00:33.598
I'M AMY BRUNI.

00:33.633 --> 00:36.034
AND I'M ADAM BERRY.

00:36.069 --> 00:38.102
WE'VE SPENT
A COMBINED 30 YEARS

00:38.137 --> 00:41.741
INVESTIGATING THE WORLD'S
MOST TERRIFYING HAUNTINGS.

00:41.776 --> 00:43.808
AFTER THOUSANDS OF CASES,

00:43.843 --> 00:46.946
WE ARE READY FOR OUR
MOST IMPORTANT JOURNEY YET.

00:48.882 --> 00:53.019
RESCUING FAMILIES TERRORIZED
BY PARANORMAL ACTIVITY

00:53.054 --> 00:55.887
IN THEIR OWN HOMES.

00:55.922 --> 00:58.791
WE UNCOVER THE TRUTH
BEHIND THE HAUNTING

00:58.826 --> 01:01.660
TO HELP FAMILIES
RECLAIM THEIR HOMES...

01:01.661 --> 01:03.162
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

01:03.197 --> 01:04.628
...AND THEIR LIVES.

01:04.663 --> 01:07.700
CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY
DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS

01:11.904 --> 01:14.107
I KNOW YOU'VE BROUGHT ME HERE
TO THIS BEAUTIFUL LAKE,

01:14.142 --> 01:16.375
BUT I DOUBT THE GHOSTS
ARE IN THE WATER.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.311
NO.
THEY'RE NOT, ACTUALLY.

01:18.346 --> 01:19.811
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

01:19.846 --> 01:22.881
THERE'S A LOCAL FAMILY HERE --
A MOM, A DAD AND THEIR TWO KIDS.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.682
THE MOM'S THE ONE WHO CALLED ME.
HER NAME'S KATIE.

01:24.717 --> 01:28.487
AND THEY'VE JUST BEEN HAVING
NONSTOP ACTIVITY IN THEIR HOUSE.

01:28.522 --> 01:30.957
SHE'S MOSTLY CONCERNED
BECAUSE HER 11-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER

01:30.992 --> 01:33.324
IS TERRIFIED TO BE
IN THE HOUSE.

01:33.359 --> 01:37.112
IT'S AT THE POINT WHERE SHE
SLEEPS WITH KATIE AT NIGHT.

01:37.147 --> 01:40.866
SHE HAS SEEN APPARITIONS.
SHE'S SEEN SHADOW FIGURES.

01:40.867 --> 01:42.135
- THE LITTLE GIRL?
- THE LITTLE GIRL HAS.

01:42.170 --> 01:43.603
- OKAY.
- THEY'VE ALL HAD ACTIVITY.

01:43.638 --> 01:46.137
- WOW!
- I KNOW.

01:46.172 --> 01:48.274
I MEAN, IT'S INTERESTING
THAT THEY ALL CLAIM

01:48.309 --> 01:49.841
TO HAVE SEEN THE SHADOW,

01:49.876 --> 01:51.944
AND I THINK THAT'S THE BIGGEST
PROBLEM WE HAVE TO SOLVE.

01:51.979 --> 01:53.846
I THINK WHAT THEY WANT
IS THEY JUST WANT

01:53.881 --> 01:55.213
TO HELP EMILY
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

01:55.248 --> 01:57.715
THEY WANT HER
TO FEEL SAFE IN HER HOUSE.

01:57.750 --> 02:00.186
I'M NERVOUS BECAUSE THERE'S
A LOT RIDING ON THIS CASE

02:00.221 --> 02:01.519
BECAUSE
SHE'S 11 YEARS OLD,

02:01.554 --> 02:04.290
AND IT SEEMS LIKE
IT'S AFFECTED HER SO MUCH.

02:04.325 --> 02:07.026
BUT IF ANYONE
CAN FIGURE IT OUT, IT'S US.

02:07.061 --> 02:08.127
YEAH.

02:09.696 --> 02:11.696
WE TAKE ALL OF
OUR CASES SERIOUSLY,

02:11.731 --> 02:15.034
BUT WHEN KIDS ARE INVOLVED,
IT REALLY UPS THE STAKES.

02:19.338 --> 02:22.575
BOTH ADAM AND I HAD PARANORMAL
EXPERIENCES AS CHILDREN.

02:22.610 --> 02:24.042
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
- EMILY.

02:24.043 --> 02:27.163
SO WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS

02:27.198 --> 02:30.248
TO HANDLE THESE
SITUATIONS DELICATELY.

02:30.283 --> 02:33.052
THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS IS
JUST TAKE US THROUGH THE HOUSE

02:33.087 --> 02:34.685
PLACE BY PLACE
AND LET US KNOW

02:34.686 --> 02:36.220
WHERE YOU'VE HAD ACTIVITY

02:36.255 --> 02:37.857
AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED
IN THOSE AREAS.

02:37.892 --> 02:39.023
OKAY.

02:39.058 --> 02:41.091
HAS ANYTHING HAPPENED
IN THIS ROOM, OR...

02:41.126 --> 02:43.229
WHEN WE'RE SITTING IN THE LIVING
ROOM THERE WATCHING TV,

02:43.264 --> 02:45.799
WE'LL SEE A SHADOW
WALK BY THESE WINDOWS.

02:45.834 --> 02:48.334
- ON THE OUTSIDE.
- YEAH, ON THE OUTSIDE.

02:48.369 --> 02:49.902
LIKE IT'S ON THE PORCH.

02:49.937 --> 02:51.070
- YES.
- YEP.

02:53.672 --> 02:56.341
IT'S HAPPENED TO THE POINT WHERE
I'VE GONE OUT TO THE SLIDER

02:56.342 --> 02:58.611
AND THOUGHT SOMEONE
WAS COMING AROUND.

02:58.646 --> 03:00.678
- REALLY?
- YEP.

03:00.713 --> 03:03.948
LAST SUMMER, EMILY WAS ACTUALLY
SITTING HERE ON THE COUCH.

03:03.949 --> 03:05.316
I WAS IN THE KITCHEN.

03:05.351 --> 03:07.419
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
WE HEAR A VOICE,

03:07.454 --> 03:09.505
VERY LOUD, VERY CLEAR,

03:09.540 --> 03:11.557
SAY, "WHO IS THAT?"

03:11.592 --> 03:12.523
REALLY?

03:12.558 --> 03:14.859
AND IT DID IT
MULTIPLE TIMES.

03:14.894 --> 03:16.796
AND WAS IT MALE
OR FEMALE, YOU THINK?

03:16.831 --> 03:18.731
IT WAS MALE.

03:23.436 --> 03:24.735
THERE'S BEEN TIMES

03:24.770 --> 03:26.688
WHERE I'LL BE WATCHING
TELEVISION THIS WAY,

03:26.723 --> 03:28.607
AND THE LIGHT WILL BE
ON IN THE KITCHEN,

03:28.642 --> 03:30.041
AND I'LL SEE A SHADOW

03:30.076 --> 03:32.578
EITHER GOING ACROSS
THE DOORWAY HERE

03:32.613 --> 03:34.180
OR COMING
OUT OF THE KITCHEN.

03:34.215 --> 03:35.546
IT'S DARK ENOUGH

03:35.581 --> 03:36.950
WHERE I'VE THOUGHT
SOMEONE'S BEEN IN THE KITCHEN,

03:36.985 --> 03:39.718
- AND THERE'S NOBODY OUT THERE.
- WOW.

03:39.753 --> 03:40.953
ONE NIGHT OVER THERE...

03:40.988 --> 03:41.919
RIGHT.

03:41.954 --> 03:44.221
...EVERYBODY WAS IN BED.

03:44.256 --> 03:45.623
AND I WAS SITTING UP
WATCHING TV,

03:45.658 --> 03:47.125
AND ALL THE SUDDEN,
THE LIGHT GOES ON.

03:48.327 --> 03:51.563
AND IT WAS ON FOR A GOOD
FIVE SECONDS OR SO,

03:51.598 --> 03:52.864
AND IT WENT BACK OFF.

03:52.899 --> 03:54.599
CAN YOU SHOW US
WHERE THAT HAPPENED?

03:54.634 --> 03:57.602
IN THE DINING ROOM HERE.
THESE ARE THE SLIDER DOORS.

03:57.603 --> 03:59.605
SO THE LIGHT JUST CAME ON
BY ITSELF ONE NIGHT?

03:59.640 --> 04:01.457
- THE LIGHT JUST CAME ON.
- OKAY.

04:01.492 --> 04:03.275
YOU DIDN'T HEAR
ANY NOISE DOWN HERE,

04:03.310 --> 04:04.710
LIKE THE SHADES
OR ANYTHING?

04:04.745 --> 04:06.863
- NO. NO.
- OKAY.

04:06.898 --> 04:08.946
WAIT A SECOND.

04:08.981 --> 04:10.681
I SAW SOMETHING
RIGHT OVER HERE.

04:10.716 --> 04:12.801
CAN YOU WALK FOR ME,
AMY, IN THE HALLWAY,

04:12.836 --> 04:14.887
TO SEE IF IT CASTS
A SHADOW ON THIS DOOR?

04:14.922 --> 04:15.922
OKAY.

04:20.259 --> 04:21.961
- TO WHERE? HERE?
- YEAH, THAT'S FINE.

04:21.995 --> 04:24.730
ANYWHERE
IN FRONT OF LIGHT.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.731
WHY?

04:26.766 --> 04:29.800
BECAUSE I TURNED THIS WAY
WHEN EVERYONE WAS GOING,

04:29.835 --> 04:33.171
AND I SAW WHAT I THOUGHT
WAS LIKE A SHADOW GO THIS WAY.

04:33.172 --> 04:34.405
YEAH.
BUT IT WAS --

04:34.440 --> 04:35.674
IT'S --
NO, IT'S NOT YOU.

04:38.444 --> 04:40.129
WAS IT FROM WITHIN?

04:40.164 --> 04:41.990
NO. IT'S OUTSIDE.

04:42.025 --> 04:44.322
BY THAT RED THING.

04:44.357 --> 04:46.584
IT WAS RIGHT HERE.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.287
LIKE, LITERALLY LIKE
ON THE GROUND HERE?

04:48.322 --> 04:50.323
YES.
IT WAS THIS HIGH.

04:52.424 --> 04:53.993
AND IT WAS HERE TO HERE.

04:54.028 --> 04:55.459
IT WAS VERY QUICK,

04:55.494 --> 04:58.564
BUT I JUST WANTED
TO PUT IT OUT THERE.

04:58.599 --> 04:59.663
OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE,

04:59.698 --> 05:01.732
I SAW A SHADOW MOVE
FROM LEFT TO RIGHT.

05:01.767 --> 05:04.170
IT WAS SOMETHING WEIRD.
IT WAS VERY STRANGE.

05:04.205 --> 05:05.470
AND THE FAMILY DOES SAY

05:05.505 --> 05:06.872
THAT THEY EXPERIENCE SHADOWS

05:06.907 --> 05:08.239
WALKING ON THEIR FRONT PORCH.

05:08.240 --> 05:11.927
SO MAYBE IT WALKS
THE PERIMETER OF THEIR HOUSE.

05:11.962 --> 05:15.615
SO WE'RE JUST GONNA GO
RIGHT UP THE STAIRS.

05:15.650 --> 05:18.501
ONE DAY, EMILY AND I
WERE DOWNSTAIRS.

05:18.536 --> 05:21.318
MY MOM CAME UP HERE
TO GET SOMETHING,

05:21.353 --> 05:24.690
AND SHE WENT TO COME BACK
DOWN THE STAIRS, AND SHE FELL.

05:24.725 --> 05:26.123
- NO.
- MY GOD.

05:26.158 --> 05:28.659
SO, OF COURSE,
I CAME FLYING OVER.

05:28.694 --> 05:31.914
AND SHE KEPT SAYING SHE FELT
LIKE SHE WAS PUSHED.

05:31.949 --> 05:35.099
THEY SEE SHADOWS
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE HOUSE.

05:35.134 --> 05:37.436
BUT THE FACT THAT THE PERSON
WAS PUSHED DOWN THE STAIRS

05:37.471 --> 05:40.004
IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT
KIND OF FORCEFUL ACTIVITY.

05:40.039 --> 05:43.943
ONE DAY, I WAS COMING UP THE
STAIRS TO GO INTO THE BATHROOM.

05:43.978 --> 05:47.712
I ROUNDED THE HALLWAY,
AND I STARTED TO HEAD DOWN.

05:47.713 --> 05:50.280
AND I LOOKED
INTO THE BATHROOM,

05:50.315 --> 05:55.421
AND I SAW WHAT APPEARED
TO BE A SHADOW.

05:55.456 --> 05:58.858
I WENT IN,
TURNED THE LIGHT ON...

05:58.893 --> 05:59.823
RIGHT.

05:59.858 --> 06:02.893
...AND NOBODY WAS THERE.

06:02.928 --> 06:05.830
THIS IS BARRY'S ROOM
IN HERE.

06:05.865 --> 06:09.936
HE WOKE UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

06:09.971 --> 06:13.004
PROBABLY AROUND 2:30
OR SO.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.191
HE DID NOT
HAVE HIS WINDOWS OPEN.

06:15.226 --> 06:17.343
THEY WERE CLOSED
AS THEY ARE NOW.

06:17.378 --> 06:21.045
AND HE TOLD ME

06:21.080 --> 06:25.017
HE THOUGHT HE HEARD WHAT SOUNDED
LIKE MONKEYS OUTSIDE.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.419
MONKEYS?
LIKE CHIMPANZEES OR...?

06:27.454 --> 06:28.820
MORE LIKE A GORILLA.

06:28.821 --> 06:30.688
- GORILLA, LIKE GRUNTING?
- YES.

06:30.723 --> 06:33.659
WOW! AND THE WINDOWS
WERE CLOSED, THOUGH?

06:33.694 --> 06:35.592
YEAH, ALL THE WINDOWS
WERE CLOSED.

06:35.627 --> 06:37.630
HE'S LIKE, "WELL, OKAY,
MAYBE I'M JUST HEARING THINGS."

06:37.665 --> 06:40.783
SO HE CLOSED HIS EYES.
AND HE HEARD IT AGAIN.

06:40.818 --> 06:43.902
HE SAID IT LASTED ABOUT
10 SECONDS EACH TIME.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.839
DID HE THINK THEY WERE MONKEYS
BECAUSE OF THE VOCAL INFLECTION

06:46.874 --> 06:47.905
THE MONKEYS WERE MAKING,

06:47.940 --> 06:51.275
OR WAS IT, LIKE,
BANGING AND RUSTLING?

06:51.310 --> 06:52.945
NO, NO. IT WAS THE VOCAL.
IT WAS THE GRUNTING.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.378
IT WAS THE ACTUAL CALL
OF THE MONKEY.

06:54.413 --> 06:57.249
MORE LIKE, PROBABLY,
A GORILLA HE WAS DESCRIBING.

06:57.284 --> 07:00.086
ALL RIGHT, EMILY,
WHY DON'T YOU COME ON IN HERE,

07:00.121 --> 07:01.752
AND WE'LL TALK
A LITTLE BIT

07:01.787 --> 07:04.873
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON
IN YOUR ROOM.

07:04.908 --> 07:07.651
WELL, I WAS HEARING
WHISPERS IN MY EAR.

07:07.686 --> 07:10.395
AND I SAW A SHADOW
WALKING TOWARDS ME.

07:10.396 --> 07:12.463
AND I KIND OF
FREAKED OUT AND RAN.

07:12.498 --> 07:14.901
AND SO WAS MOM
IN HERE WITH YOU?

07:14.936 --> 07:16.200
YEAH.

07:16.235 --> 07:17.552
SO SHE WOKE YOU UP, MOM?

07:17.587 --> 07:18.835
- YES, SHE DID.
- OKAY.

07:18.870 --> 07:21.123
AND SHE WAS
SCREAMING FOR ME.

07:21.158 --> 07:23.341
WHEN YOU'RE A CHILD IN BED,

07:23.376 --> 07:25.544
WAKING UP AND SEEING
A SHADOW FIGURE

07:25.579 --> 07:27.180
HAS GOTTA BE TERRIFYING.

07:27.215 --> 07:28.746
SO I WANNA SIT WITH EMILY

07:28.781 --> 07:31.451
AND SEE HOW BADLY
THIS IS AFFECTING HER.

07:36.989 --> 07:39.724
HOW DO YOU FEEL
IN YOUR HOUSE RIGHT NOW?

07:39.725 --> 07:41.560
UM, NOT GOOD.

07:41.595 --> 07:42.526
NO.

07:42.561 --> 07:43.796
NO, I FEEL REALLY SCARED.

07:43.831 --> 07:45.129
YEAH.

07:45.164 --> 07:49.401
ESPECIALLY UPSTAIRS 'CAUSE
THAT'S WHERE MOST OF IT HAPPENS.

07:49.436 --> 07:52.971
YOU PROBABLY DON'T GO UPSTAIRS
BY YOURSELF TOO OFTEN.

07:53.006 --> 07:54.104
NO.

07:54.139 --> 07:55.639
WHEN DID THAT START?

07:55.674 --> 07:59.010
UM, IT STARTED RIGHT
WHEN WE MOVED IN, ACTUALLY.

07:59.045 --> 08:01.597
I SAW A SHADOW
IN MY BATHROOM.

08:01.632 --> 08:04.150
I WAS WALKING
DOWN THE HALLWAY,

08:04.185 --> 08:05.717
AND I LOOKED BACK,

08:05.718 --> 08:07.620
AND I SAW A SHADOW
WALKING TOWARDS ME,

08:07.655 --> 08:09.587
LIKE, REALLY FAST.

08:09.622 --> 08:11.707
HOW LONG DID YOU LOOK
AT THESE SHADOWS?

08:11.742 --> 08:13.758
WERE YOU JUST LOOKING
STRAIGHT AT THEM?

08:13.793 --> 08:16.162
WELL, I WAS SCARED,
SO I DIDN'T LOOK AT IT FOR LONG.

08:16.197 --> 08:19.965
YEAH.
NO, I DON'T BLAME YOU.

08:24.437 --> 08:26.705
HERE, LET'S COME OUT HERE
FOR A MINUTE.

08:26.740 --> 08:29.207
MY GOODNESS.

08:30.442 --> 08:34.711
UM, SO,
MY INITIAL THOUGHT --

08:34.746 --> 08:37.881
THE ACTIVITY'S CENTERED
ON THE RIGHT SIDE,

08:37.883 --> 08:39.583
LITERALLY THE BACK SIDE
OF THE HOUSE.

08:39.619 --> 08:41.284
SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
THE BATHROOM,

08:41.320 --> 08:43.153
HIS ROOM, HER ROOM.

08:43.188 --> 08:45.958
THE DAUGHTER'S ROOM, THE SON'S
ROOM, AND THE BATHROOM.

08:45.993 --> 08:48.727
YEAH. I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE
IF WE GET A LIST

08:48.762 --> 08:50.895
OF PEOPLE WHO OWNED THIS LAND
BEFORE

08:50.930 --> 08:53.598
AND MAYBE SOME PEOPLE
TIED TO THE PROPERTY,

08:53.599 --> 08:55.767
TRY TO GET SOME
FAMILY INFORMATION,

08:55.802 --> 08:57.520
AND MAYBE FOCUS ON
WHAT'S DOWN HERE,

08:57.555 --> 08:59.238
LOOK FOR SHADOWS
FOR A LITTLE BIT.

08:59.273 --> 09:00.572
- THE SHADOWS OUT HERE?
- YEAH.

09:00.607 --> 09:01.872
AND THEN WE'LL GO UP
BEFORE WE GO

09:01.873 --> 09:03.874
AND TRY TO CONNECT AGAIN.

09:03.909 --> 09:05.944
USE THE BooBuddy,
USE THE FLASHLIGHTS.

09:05.945 --> 09:07.213
I DON'T KNOW.
- WE'LL FIND SOMETHING.

09:09.748 --> 09:11.583
ANY TIME THERE'S
A CHILD INVOLVED

09:11.618 --> 09:13.017
AND THEY'RE SCARED,

09:13.018 --> 09:16.053
THIS KIND OF STUFF
IS REALLY HARD FOR ME TO TAKE.

09:16.088 --> 09:18.824
WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE LIKE EMILY
AND SHE'S FREAKED OUT,

09:18.859 --> 09:20.743
IT'S HARD FOR HER
TO SLEEP AT NIGHT.

09:20.778 --> 09:22.593
MOVE IT TO THE LEFT
A LITTLE BIT.

09:22.628 --> 09:25.163
I WANT HER TO BE COMFORTABLE
IN HER OWN HOUSE.

09:25.198 --> 09:27.617
SETTING UP A CAMERA
ON THE FRONT PORCH AREA.

09:27.652 --> 09:29.795
THEY SEE SHADOWS GO BY HERE
QUITE OFTEN.

09:29.830 --> 09:31.938
WE'RE HOPING IT'LL HAPPEN
WHILE WE'RE HERE.

09:37.709 --> 09:39.876
LET'S GO
TO EMILY'S ROOM.

09:39.911 --> 09:41.546
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE
DEALING WITH IN THIS HOUSE --

09:41.547 --> 09:44.166
IF IT'S MALE, IF IT'S FEMALE,
IF IT'S A CHILD --

09:44.201 --> 09:46.785
SO WE'RE GONNA JUST
THROW EVERYTHING OUT THERE

09:46.820 --> 09:48.521
AND SEE IF WE CAN
NARROW IT DOWN.

09:54.626 --> 09:56.762
RECORDER, SPIRIT BOX,
BooBuddy, FLASHLIGHTS.

09:56.797 --> 09:59.797
I'LL GET THE FLASHLIGHTS.
- OKAY.

09:59.832 --> 10:02.068
WE'RE GONNA TRY TO USE
THE FLASHLIGHT TECHNIQUE

10:02.103 --> 10:04.270
TO COMMUNICATE
WITH WHATEVER'S HERE.

10:04.305 --> 10:05.635
YOU SET THEM OUT

10:05.670 --> 10:07.406
AND JUST ASK THE ENTITIES
TO TRY TO INTERACT WITH THEM.

10:07.441 --> 10:08.906
AND THERE'S JUST
SOMETHING UNIVERSAL

10:08.907 --> 10:10.109
ABOUT A LIGHT
TURNING ON AND OFF.

10:10.144 --> 10:12.278
EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THAT.

10:12.313 --> 10:14.378
WHOEVER'S IN HERE WITH US,

10:14.413 --> 10:16.415
YOU SEE WHAT ADAM'S
DOING RIGHT NOW?

10:16.450 --> 10:18.501
THAT'S HOW YOU
TURN THEM ON AND OFF.

10:18.536 --> 10:20.518
SO YOU JUST GIVE IT
A LITTLE TWIST,

10:20.553 --> 10:23.455
AND THE LIGHT WILL
COME ON ALL BY ITSELF.

10:23.490 --> 10:25.925
LET'S DO
AN EVP SESSION, TOO.

10:27.893 --> 10:30.596
SO, WHOEVER IS
IN THIS HOUSE WITH US...

10:30.631 --> 10:33.132
DID YOU LIVE HERE?

10:35.000 --> 10:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:43.041 --> 10:45.675
YEAH.
I HEARD IT, TOO.

10:45.710 --> 10:47.544
ARE YOU IN HERE
WITH US NOW?

10:47.579 --> 10:49.582
OR IF YOU WANNA TURN ON ONE
OF THOSE FLASHLIGHTS

10:49.617 --> 10:51.014
AND USE THOSE
TO COMMUNICATE,

10:51.049 --> 10:52.483
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS TWIST THE END

10:52.484 --> 10:54.153
AND GET OUR ATTENTION.

11:10.636 --> 11:12.538
OR IF YOU WANNA TURN ON ONE
OF THOSE FLASHLIGHTS,

11:12.573 --> 11:14.807
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS TWIST THE END.

11:23.682 --> 11:25.749
OKAY.
GOOD JOB.

11:25.784 --> 11:27.301
SO THAT'S
THE RED LIGHT.

11:27.336 --> 11:28.819
THE MIDDLE ONE, YEAH.

11:28.820 --> 11:30.453
SO CAN YOU TURN IT
BACK OFF?

11:30.488 --> 11:32.340
JUST TWIST IT
THE OTHER DIRECTION

11:32.375 --> 11:34.193
UNTIL IT TURNS OFF
ALL THE WAY?

11:44.736 --> 11:46.236
NOW, CAN YOU TRY
ONE OF THE OTHER ONES?

11:46.271 --> 11:48.305
CAN YOU TRY THE BLUE LIGHT
OR THE BLACK LIGHT

11:48.306 --> 11:50.843
SO WE KNOW IT'S YOU?

11:52.545 --> 11:54.046
I DON'T KNOW.

11:54.081 --> 11:55.513
IT ONLY WENT OFF ONCE.

11:55.548 --> 11:58.000
IT COULD'VE JUST BEEN
A COINCIDENCE.

11:58.035 --> 12:00.452
SO FAR,
ONE FLASHLIGHT TURNED ON.

12:00.487 --> 12:02.419
BUT WE NEED TO SEE
MORE THAN THAT.

12:02.454 --> 12:05.623
WE WANNA SEE SOMETHING
THAT GOES ON FOR A WHILE,

12:05.624 --> 12:07.391
ANSWERS QUESTIONS DIRECTLY,

12:07.426 --> 12:10.362
YOU KNOW, TURNS ON AND OFF
ONLY WHEN WE'RE ASKING THINGS.

12:10.397 --> 12:11.964
WE NEED TO BE SURE
THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY

12:11.999 --> 12:13.998
COMMUNICATING WITH SOMETHING.

12:14.033 --> 12:15.667
SO LET'S LISTEN TO IT.

12:26.478 --> 12:27.545
WHAT WAS THAT?

12:34.553 --> 12:35.637
WHAT IS THAT?

12:35.672 --> 12:36.721
IT'S NOT ME.

12:36.756 --> 12:37.656
NO.

12:39.558 --> 12:41.291
CAN'T MAKE IT OUT.

12:41.326 --> 12:43.228
SOUNDS LIKE A MAN.
THAT'S WEIRD BECAUSE IT --

12:43.263 --> 12:45.830
YOU CAN HEAR
SOMETHING CHATTERING.

12:45.831 --> 12:46.930
RIGHT.

12:46.965 --> 12:48.533
SEEMED LIKE IT KIND OF
TAPERED OUT A LITTLE BIT,

12:48.568 --> 12:52.103
LIKE IT WAS
HARD FOR IT TO KEEP GOING.

12:52.138 --> 12:53.738
IT JUST USED
A LOT OF ENERGY.

12:53.739 --> 12:56.541
I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE SOMETHING
HERE IS TRYING TO REACH OUT.

12:56.576 --> 12:58.075
WE GOT AN EVP.

12:58.110 --> 12:59.843
IT WAS DEFINITELY
A MALE VOICE.

12:59.878 --> 13:03.249
NOTHING MAJOR, NOTHING,
YOU KNOW, THAT'S IDENTIFIABLE.

13:03.284 --> 13:05.015
SO IT'S FRUSTRATING BECAUSE,

13:05.050 --> 13:06.852
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU FEEL
AS THOUGH THERE IS SOMETHING

13:06.887 --> 13:08.252
TRYING TO REACH OUT TO YOU,

13:08.253 --> 13:10.256
BUT YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.

13:11.790 --> 13:14.959
SO I'VE RESEARCHED ANIMALS
IN THE AREA.

13:14.960 --> 13:18.195
I'M GONNA PLAY ALL THESE SOUNDS
FOR BARRY,

13:18.230 --> 13:21.934
AND I'M GONNA SEE WHAT MATCHES
UP TO THE SOUND THAT HE HEARD

13:21.969 --> 13:23.100
THE BEST.

13:23.135 --> 13:25.253
SO WE'RE GONNA START
WITH THIS ONE FIRST.

13:25.288 --> 13:27.372
AND YOU JUST TAKE A LISTEN.
THIS IS "A".

13:31.811 --> 13:34.045
- NO?
- NO.

13:34.046 --> 13:35.247
"A" IS OUT, RIGHT?

13:35.282 --> 13:36.413
HOW ABOUT THIS ONE?

13:38.651 --> 13:39.951
YEAH, A LITTLE.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.285
THAT'S IT?

13:41.320 --> 13:43.288
SO THAT'S SIMILAR
TO THE SOUND YOU HEARD?

13:48.059 --> 13:50.728
THAT'S -- IS THAT --
REALLY?

13:50.729 --> 13:52.330
IT'S LIKE AN OWL.

13:52.365 --> 13:54.066
THAT'S IT?

13:55.767 --> 13:57.968
THAT IS A BARRED OWL.

13:58.003 --> 13:59.538
I MEAN, THAT'S KIND OF SCARY,
THOUGH.

13:59.573 --> 14:01.237
HONESTLY,
THAT'S FREAKY TO ME.

14:01.272 --> 14:04.175
SO, I MEAN, I CAN SEE HOW,
AT NIGHT, IF YOU WAKE UP

14:04.210 --> 14:05.676
AND YOU HEAR SOMETHING
LIKE THAT --

14:05.677 --> 14:08.780
AND IT WAS -- IT SOUNDED LIKE
IT WAS, LIKE, RIGHT NEXT TO ME.

14:08.815 --> 14:10.314
RIGHT. I MEAN,
HERE'S THE --

14:10.315 --> 14:13.017
YOU ARE REALLY CLOSE
TO THAT TREE,

14:13.052 --> 14:14.485
AND YOU'RE ALSO ON
THAT SIDE OF THE HOUSE,

14:14.520 --> 14:16.454
SO WHAT'S TO SAY IT WASN'T,
LIKE, PERCHED ON THE ROOF

14:16.489 --> 14:18.991
FOR A SECOND, LIKE RIGHT WHERE
YOUR WINDOW IS?

14:19.026 --> 14:20.625
'CAUSE YOUR WINDOW LOOKS OUT
OVER THAT --

14:20.660 --> 14:22.593
OVER THAT THING.
- SURE.

14:22.628 --> 14:25.028
I MEAN, I'D SAY
YOUR BEST BET

14:25.063 --> 14:27.498
IS TO SAY THAT
IT WAS AN OWL LIKE THAT.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.868
SO HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT --
I MEAN, HOW DO YOU
FEEL ABOUT THAT?

14:29.903 --> 14:31.034
WEIRD.

14:31.069 --> 14:32.804
NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT, YOU KNOW,

14:32.839 --> 14:34.072
SOMETHING SCREECHING OUT.

14:34.107 --> 14:35.439
WELL, MAYBE AN OWL.

14:35.474 --> 14:37.392
YOU CAN WORRY ABOUT AN OWL
HOOTING AT YOUR WINDOW.

14:37.427 --> 14:39.311
BUT IT'S NOT GONNA BE SOMEONE
WHO'S, LIKE, PASSED ON

14:39.346 --> 14:41.078
AND, LIKE, TRYING TO
GET YOUR ATTENTION

14:41.113 --> 14:42.848
'CAUSE THEY GOT TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING, YOU KNOW?

14:45.050 --> 14:46.718
TODAY, WE'RE GOING
TO SIT DOWN WITH KATIE

14:46.719 --> 14:49.621
AND SEE WHAT SHE CAN TELL US
ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE LAND,

14:49.656 --> 14:52.675
THE PREVIOUS OWNERS,
AND ANY OTHER INFORMATION

14:52.710 --> 14:55.694
THAT MAY HELP US GET A LEAD
ON THIS MALE VOICE.

14:55.729 --> 14:57.795
WHEN WAS THIS HOUSE BUILT?

14:57.796 --> 14:59.629
PROBABLY BUILT BACK
IN THE '20s.

14:59.664 --> 15:01.399
DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW
THE NAMES OF THE PEOPLE

15:01.434 --> 15:02.868
WHO OWNED
THE HOUSE BEFORE?

15:02.903 --> 15:04.267
- I HAVE NO IDEA.
- OKAY.

15:04.302 --> 15:06.605
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE LAND

15:06.640 --> 15:08.505
BEFORE THESE HOUSES
WERE HERE, OR...?

15:08.540 --> 15:12.977
THE ONLY THING THAT I KNOW,
IN TALKING TO AN OLD NEIGHBOR,

15:13.012 --> 15:15.446
SHE HAD A MEDIUM TELL HER

15:15.481 --> 15:19.501
THERE WAS NATIVE AMERICAN MAN,
A WARRIOR,

15:19.536 --> 15:23.521
WHO IS SUPPOSEDLY
PATROLLING THIS AREA.

15:24.523 --> 15:25.991
WHETHER THAT'S TRUE OR NOT,

15:26.026 --> 15:27.424
I'M NOT REALLY SURE.
- OKAY.

15:27.459 --> 15:29.794
WE WERE ALSO TOLD
THAT THERE WAS A MAN

15:29.829 --> 15:32.130
WHO DIED OF
A HEART ATTACK IN THE HOUSE.

15:32.165 --> 15:33.599
- WOW!
- WOW!

15:36.134 --> 15:40.672
FINDING OUT THE HISTORY
WILL BE PIVOTAL IN THIS CASE.

15:40.707 --> 15:44.610
WHILE I GET DEED INFORMATION
ON THE HOUSE,

15:44.645 --> 15:46.377
ADAM'S GOING TO SEE
WHAT HE CAN FIND

15:46.412 --> 15:49.146
AT THE TOWN HISTORICAL SOCIETY.

15:49.147 --> 15:51.682
WE ARE INVESTIGATING A HOUSE
ON THE HIGHWAY DOWN HERE,

15:51.717 --> 15:54.218
AND I'M WONDERING IF YOU KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THE LAND

15:54.219 --> 15:57.689
OR THE PREVIOUS HOMEOWNERS
OF THAT PROPERTY.

15:57.724 --> 16:00.158
THERE IS SOME HISTORY
ABOUT THE ROAD.

16:00.193 --> 16:01.257
OKAY.

16:01.292 --> 16:04.363
IT WAS EARLY 1800s
WHEN THEY WERE EXCAVATING

16:04.398 --> 16:06.498
RIGHT BY THE MELVIN
VILLAGE CHURCH.

16:06.533 --> 16:08.599
YEAH.
I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THAT IS.

16:08.600 --> 16:14.973
THEY FOUND THIS SKELETON,
AND IT WAS A 7-FOOT-TALL INDIAN.

16:15.008 --> 16:16.306
THIS IS WHERE THEY
FOUND HIM.

16:16.341 --> 16:19.278
THIS IS THE EMBANKMENT,
WHEN THEY WERE EXCAVATING,

16:19.313 --> 16:21.714
THE EMBANKMENT
THEY FOUND THE BONES.

16:21.749 --> 16:24.115
OF THIS 7-FOOT-TALL
NATIVE AMERICAN.

16:24.150 --> 16:25.214
YES.

16:25.249 --> 16:26.417
THAT IS A TALL PERSON.

16:26.452 --> 16:27.451
BIG.

16:27.486 --> 16:30.921
THEY'RE ASSUMING
HE PROBABLY WAS A CHIEF.

16:30.956 --> 16:33.124
WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT
NATIVE AMERICAN BURIAL GROUNDS

16:33.159 --> 16:34.876
THROUGHOUT THE YEARS
OF INVESTIGATING.

16:34.911 --> 16:36.559
BUT THIS ONE SEEMS
TO HAVE SOME TRACTION.

16:36.594 --> 16:40.497
AND IF THERE IS ONE CONFIRMED
INDIAN GRAVE IN THE TOWN,

16:40.532 --> 16:45.370
MAYBE THERE'S MORE AND POSSIBLY
EVEN ONE ON KATIE'S PROPERTY.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.572
DID THEY FIND ANY OTHER
GRAVES AROUND HERE?

16:47.607 --> 16:48.538
YES.

16:48.573 --> 16:51.875
IN THE 1930s,
THEY FOUND BONES,

16:51.910 --> 16:55.546
AND THEN THEY DIDN'T APPARENTLY
KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT.

16:55.547 --> 16:56.513
OKAY.

16:56.548 --> 16:58.148
AND THE INDIANS
THEN DECIDE

16:58.183 --> 17:01.152
THEY SHOULD BE RETURNED
TO WHERE THEY WERE FOUND.

17:01.187 --> 17:03.021
AND ARE THEY MARKED
OR UNMARKED?

17:03.056 --> 17:04.353
- NO.
- THEY'RE NOT MARKED.

17:04.387 --> 17:06.425
- NO.
- SO THEY COULD BE ANYWHERE.

17:08.358 --> 17:12.329
THIS LAND WAS, AT ONE TIME,
INHABITED BY NATIVE AMERICANS.

17:12.364 --> 17:14.464
WE DON'T KNOW
THE EXTENT OF IT.

17:14.499 --> 17:16.335
WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY LIVED
DIRECTLY ON THE LAND.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.036
BUT AT LEAST NOW
WE HAVE A DIRECTION

17:18.070 --> 17:20.689
FOR OUR INVESTIGATION.

17:20.723 --> 17:23.308
SO, EXCITING NEWS.

17:23.343 --> 17:26.676
WHAT? YES?

17:26.678 --> 17:29.915
WE'VE SOLVED THE CASE OF THE
CHIMPANZEES OUT THE WINDOW.

17:29.950 --> 17:31.783
- I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
- YEAH, WE DID.

17:31.818 --> 17:33.584
I WILL PLAY IT FOR YOU.

17:40.592 --> 17:41.825
YEAH.

17:41.860 --> 17:43.628
OKAY, SO IN THE BEGINNING,
THAT'S CLEARLY AN OWL,

17:43.663 --> 17:45.563
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW OWLS
MADE THAT NOISE.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.632
RIGHT. IT'S A BARRED OWL.
THEY'RE BARRED OWLS.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.065
- BARRED OWL?
- AND THEY ARE --

17:49.100 --> 17:50.935
WAIT,
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?

17:50.970 --> 17:52.204
SHOW ME A PICTURE OF ONE.

17:52.239 --> 17:53.222
RIGHT HERE.

17:54.205 --> 17:56.841
I SAW A BARRED OWL
LAST NIGHT

17:56.876 --> 17:58.510
ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.

17:58.545 --> 17:59.642
- NO!
- YES.

17:59.677 --> 18:01.112
I WAS LIKE,
"WHAT IS THAT OWL" --

18:01.113 --> 18:03.248
YES. IT WAS ON
THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.

18:03.283 --> 18:05.348
IT HAD PROBABLY
EATEN SOMETHING.

18:05.383 --> 18:07.152
THAT'S THE EXACT OWL I SAW.
- THAT'S IT.

18:07.187 --> 18:08.318
THAT IS A BARRED OWL.

18:08.353 --> 18:10.020
THEY'RE ALL AROUND
THE NORTHEAST.

18:10.055 --> 18:12.023
EVERY PICTURE OF A BARRED OWL
THAT I SEE,

18:12.058 --> 18:13.823
THEY ARE IN THESE TREES.

18:13.858 --> 18:15.693
THEY HAVE A HUGE PINE TREE
RIGHT THERE.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.060
HIS ROOM IS RIGHT UP HERE.

18:17.095 --> 18:18.963
IT COULD BE RIGHT IN THAT TREE,
RIGHT UPSTAIRS.

18:18.998 --> 18:20.797
IT COULD EVEN BE ON THE HOUSE
FOR ALL WE KNOW.

18:20.832 --> 18:24.169
IT'S GREAT. WE KNOW THERE'S NOT,
LIKE, THIS CRAZY, WEIRD THING

18:24.204 --> 18:25.802
MAKING SOUNDS
OUTSIDE OF HIS WINDOW.

18:25.837 --> 18:27.572
IT'S COOL. AND I'M GLAD WE WERE
ABLE TO FIGURE IT OUT.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.373
AND THE DAD IS HAPPY ABOUT IT,
TOO.

18:29.374 --> 18:32.342
AND THEN, ABOUT THIS LAND.

18:32.377 --> 18:35.213
IN, LIKE, THE EARLY 1800s,
THEY FOUND THE SKELETON

18:35.248 --> 18:37.514
OF A 7-FOOT-TALL
NATIVE AMERICAN BURIED

18:37.515 --> 18:41.620
IN THE GROUND LITERALLY
DOWN HERE BY THE CHURCH.

18:41.655 --> 18:42.719
YEAH.

18:42.720 --> 18:44.354
AND THERE COULD BE BURIALS

18:44.389 --> 18:47.926
ANYWHERE IN THIS TOWN,
AND THEY'RE NOT MARKED.

18:47.961 --> 18:49.293
I DON'T KNOW.
I LIKE IT.

18:49.328 --> 18:53.031
WE CAN USE ALL THIS RESEARCH
WHEN WE INVESTIGATE TONIGHT.

18:53.066 --> 18:54.564
HOW ABOUT YOU, MISS?

18:54.599 --> 18:56.467
THE ONLY THING I DID FIND,

18:56.468 --> 18:59.421
THE PEOPLE WHO SOLD
THIS LAND ORIGINALLY,

18:59.456 --> 19:01.866
THEY IMMIGRATED OVER --
AT LEAST MILTON DID.

19:01.901 --> 19:04.456
MILTON WIGGIN WAS
THE PREVIOUS LANDOWNER.

19:04.491 --> 19:07.012
HIS FAMILY OWNED A LOT
OF LOCAL BUSINESSES

19:07.047 --> 19:08.512
AND KIND OF RAN
THE TOWN.

19:08.547 --> 19:10.747
THEY'RE VERY CONNECTED
WITH THIS AREA.

19:10.782 --> 19:13.452
SO I WAS THINKING HE MIGHT
BE THE MALE VOICE WE HEARD.

19:13.487 --> 19:15.754
OR IT COULD BE
THE 7-FOOT-TALL NATIVE AMERICAN.

19:15.789 --> 19:17.321
I MEAN, EITHER WAY,
WE DEFINITELY HAVE

19:17.356 --> 19:19.124
A LOT MORE INFORMATION
THAN WE DID YESTERDAY.

19:19.159 --> 19:20.591
AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO SEE WHAT WE GET

19:20.626 --> 19:21.959
WHEN WE REVIEW
THE EVIDENCE,

19:21.960 --> 19:24.596
SEE WHAT MATCHES UP,
AND SEE WHAT'S MOST LOGICAL.

19:26.031 --> 19:27.997
TONIGHT,
WE'RE GONNA SHIFT FOCUS.

19:28.032 --> 19:30.636
WE'RE GONNA START GOING
INTO NAMES OF FORMER OWNERS

19:30.671 --> 19:32.604
AND SEE IF WE CAN
CONNECT WITH ANYTHING

19:32.639 --> 19:35.307
THAT MIGHT BE NATIVE AMERICAN.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.941
UM, WELL,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

19:37.976 --> 19:39.877
I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE
LET'S START UPSTAIRS

19:39.912 --> 19:41.779
'CAUSE THAT'S WHERE MOST
OF THE CLAIMS ARE.

19:41.814 --> 19:42.980
RIGHT.
SHADOWS UP THERE,

19:43.015 --> 19:44.983
COMING DOWN THE HALLWAY,
GOING DOWN THE STAIRS.

19:45.018 --> 19:46.235
AND THAT BATHROOM
IS RIGHT THERE.

19:46.270 --> 19:47.417
- YES.
- SO LET'S FIGURE IT OUT.

19:47.452 --> 19:48.920
OKAY, NO, THAT'S GREAT.
LET'S DO THAT.

19:48.955 --> 19:50.589
OKAY.

19:52.857 --> 19:55.625
THIS IS AMY AND ADAM.

19:55.660 --> 20:00.298
AND THEY SAY THEY SEE
YOU WALKING THROUGH HERE.

20:00.333 --> 20:01.597
THEY HAVE BEFORE.

20:01.632 --> 20:05.019
DO YOU WANNA STOP AND TALK
INTO THIS RED LIGHT HERE?

20:05.054 --> 20:08.407
EMILY SAYS SHE HAS SEEN YOU
IN THIS BATHROOM BEFORE.

20:11.676 --> 20:13.611
DO YOU GIVE HER
THE GOOSE BUMPS

20:13.612 --> 20:15.881
THAT SHE FEELS
WHEN SHE WALKS IN HERE?

20:19.284 --> 20:22.353
YOU WANNA TRY IT?

20:36.201 --> 20:37.167
"NO."

20:37.202 --> 20:38.270
THAT'S A "NO."

20:44.543 --> 20:45.508
WEIRD.

20:45.543 --> 20:46.710
IT IS STRANGE.

20:46.745 --> 20:48.479
NOTHING IS ADDING UP.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.115
WHY DON'T WE SWITCH TACTICS?

20:50.150 --> 20:51.214
YEAH.

20:51.249 --> 20:53.618
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA GO GRAB THE OVILUS.

20:53.653 --> 20:55.786
I'M GONNA BRING IN THE OVILUS.

20:55.821 --> 20:58.156
AN OVILUS, BASED ON
THE ENERGY AROUND IT,

20:58.191 --> 20:59.823
SPIRITS CAN MANIPULATE THAT

20:59.858 --> 21:01.524
AND TELL IT TO SAY
CERTAIN WORDS.

21:01.559 --> 21:03.829
IT HAS A WHOLE STORAGE
OF WORDS INSIDE OF IT.

21:03.864 --> 21:05.463
SO WE'RE HOPING
TO GET MORE ANSWERS

21:05.498 --> 21:09.032
FROM WHOEVER IS HERE.

21:09.067 --> 21:12.837
WHOEVER'S HERE WITH US,
CAN YOU USE THIS DEVICE

21:12.872 --> 21:15.407
AND MAKE SOME WORDS?

21:21.145 --> 21:22.914
ARE YOU NATIVE AMERICAN?

21:28.119 --> 21:30.621
DO YOU HAVE A MESSAGE
FOR THE FAMILY HERE?

21:34.025 --> 21:35.994
ARE YOU MILTON?

21:37.762 --> 21:40.966
<i> ROGER. MOSTLY. POUNDS.</i>

21:41.001 --> 21:42.533
<i> BARREL. DATE.</i>

21:42.534 --> 21:45.637
IT'S REALLY GOING CRAZY IN HERE.
IT'S NOT USUALLY THIS --

21:45.672 --> 21:47.806
LIKE, IT DOESN'T USUALLY
TALK THIS MUCH.

21:47.841 --> 21:48.771
<i> SECRET.</i>

21:48.806 --> 21:50.441
IF YOU'RE USING
THIS DEVICE,

21:50.476 --> 21:52.394
CAN YOU SLOW DOWN
A LITTLE BIT

21:52.429 --> 21:54.312
AND JUST REALLY
CONCENTRATE?

21:54.347 --> 21:56.848
<i> DATE.</i>

22:00.285 --> 22:02.821
WHERE ARE YOU?

22:03.755 --> 22:05.957
<i> TURN.</i>

22:07.192 --> 22:09.995
TURN WHERE?

22:16.734 --> 22:17.901
SEE SOMETHING?

22:17.936 --> 22:20.038
I JUST SAW SOMETHING GO
IN FRONT OF THAT WINDOW.

22:20.073 --> 22:22.372
- YOU DID?
-100%.

22:22.407 --> 22:23.675
MY GOD!
RIGHT THERE!

22:23.710 --> 22:26.144
SEE IT?

22:42.927 --> 22:44.160
SEE SOMETHING?

22:44.195 --> 22:46.630
I JUST SAW SOMETHING GO
IN FRONT OF THAT WINDOW.

22:46.631 --> 22:48.467
- YOU DID?
-100%.

22:50.769 --> 22:52.202
MY GOD!
RIGHT THERE!

22:52.237 --> 22:55.073
IT'S FAINT.
ON THE CORNER BY THE WINDOW.

22:55.108 --> 22:56.305
REWIND.

22:56.340 --> 22:58.842
LITERALLY JUST SAW SOMETHING
GO IN FRONT OF THIS.

22:58.843 --> 23:01.178
SEE IT?
RIGHT THERE.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.348
MY GOODNESS.

23:07.218 --> 23:08.418
I MEAN, WE CAN'T SAY
IT'S PARANORMAL.

23:08.453 --> 23:10.154
ANYONE, EVEN AN ANIMAL,
COULD MOVE IN FRONT

23:10.189 --> 23:11.855
OF THAT LIGHT
AND CAUSE A SHADOW.

23:11.890 --> 23:14.793
I THINK WE GO DOWNSTAIRS,
START LOOKING FOR SHADOWS.

23:14.828 --> 23:16.393
YEAH.

23:16.428 --> 23:21.098
ADAM THINKS HE MIGHT'VE SEEN
A SHADOW ON THE SECURITY CAMERA.

23:21.133 --> 23:23.868
BUT WE CAN'T BE SURE
WHAT IT WAS AT THIS POINT.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.803
WE HAVE TO GO INVESTIGATE
DOWNSTAIRS

23:25.838 --> 23:27.739
SO WE CAN SEE
FOR OURSELVES.

23:36.647 --> 23:39.050
I DON'T SEE ANY SHADOWS.

23:42.987 --> 23:46.391
WHO IS HERE
ON THE PROPERTY?

23:52.229 --> 23:53.730
ARE YOU OUTSIDE?

23:53.765 --> 23:56.868
CAN YOU WALK ACROSS THE,
PORCH THERE?

24:04.876 --> 24:08.411
NO. NOTHING.

24:08.446 --> 24:11.832
WHAT IS, LIKE,
WALKING AROUND THIS PROPERTY?

24:11.867 --> 24:15.428
I DON'T KNOW.
AND IT'S WEIRD THAT IT'S OUT--

24:15.463 --> 24:18.990
LIKE, THEY SEE IT UPSTAIRS.
THEY SEE IT OUTSIDE.

24:19.025 --> 24:21.558
THEY SEE IT
ALL THE TIME.

24:21.593 --> 24:23.661
YOU KNOW, WE'RE
DEFINITELY GONNA HAVE

24:23.696 --> 24:25.730
TO HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER
IN HERE WITH US.

24:25.765 --> 24:27.764
OKAY.

24:27.799 --> 24:29.865
I MEAN, THIS IS GONNA BE
PROBABLY A NO,

24:29.900 --> 24:32.737
BUT I'M -- I'M GONNA ASK
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE CHILDREN.

24:32.772 --> 24:34.939
NO. I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA ASK.

24:34.974 --> 24:37.942
DO YOU THINK
WE COULD GET EMILY?

24:37.977 --> 24:39.494
- NO. NO.
- IMPOSSIBLE. OKAY.

24:39.529 --> 24:40.977
I DON'T THINK
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

24:41.012 --> 24:42.764
I'VE INVESTIGATED WITH KIDS
YOUNGER THAN HER,

24:42.799 --> 24:44.516
BUT THEY WERE IN A DIFFERENT
HEAD SPACE THAN HER.

24:44.551 --> 24:45.482
RIGHT.

24:45.517 --> 24:47.318
THEY WERE MORE CURIOUS
ABOUT IT,

24:47.353 --> 24:49.085
WHERE SHE'S GENUINELY
SCARED.

24:49.120 --> 24:50.854
WE'RE GONNA NEED
AT LEAST KATIE COME IN

24:50.855 --> 24:53.057
AND INVESTIGATE WITH US.
- RIGHT.

24:53.092 --> 24:56.426
LET'S BRING HER IN
TOMORROW.

24:56.461 --> 24:58.729
WHOEVER'S IN HERE,
WE'LL BE BACK TOMORROW.

24:58.764 --> 25:01.666
BYE. GOOD NIGHT.

25:05.703 --> 25:06.870
SO WE'RE GONNA BRING KATIE

25:06.871 --> 25:09.438
INTO THE INVESTIGATION TO GAIN

25:09.473 --> 25:13.278
THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE
OF WHOEVER MIGHT BE THERE.

25:13.313 --> 25:14.412
- HI.
- HEY, GUYS.

25:14.447 --> 25:15.478
HOW YOU DOING?

25:15.513 --> 25:18.917
SOMETIMES WE LIKE TO BRING
IN THE HOMEOWNER

25:18.952 --> 25:21.083
TO KIND OF, ONE,
INTRODUCE US,

25:21.118 --> 25:23.087
BUT ALSO DO SOME
INVESTIGATING WITH US.

25:23.122 --> 25:24.821
WE'LL START
IN THE FRONT ROOM HERE

25:24.856 --> 25:26.457
AND SEE WHERE --
SEE WHERE IT TAKES US.

25:26.492 --> 25:29.525
OKAY.

25:29.560 --> 25:31.830
HOPEFULLY, BECAUSE THEY
ARE FAMILIAR WITH KATIE,

25:31.865 --> 25:33.197
THEY'RE GONNA BE
WILLING TO REACH OUT

25:33.232 --> 25:35.332
TO US A LITTLE BIT MORE.

25:37.769 --> 25:41.072
I GUESS THE FIRST THING
THAT YOU SHOULD DO

25:41.107 --> 25:44.375
IS JUST INTRODUCE WHOEVER
IS HERE TO US.

25:44.410 --> 25:47.579
TO WHOEVER MIGHT BE HERE
RIGHT NOW,

25:47.614 --> 25:49.579
I KNOW THAT YOU
ARE SEEING

25:49.614 --> 25:51.182
A LOT OF STRANGE PEOPLE
IN THE HOUSE.

25:51.217 --> 25:52.849
THEY'RE HERE TO HELP YOU.

25:52.884 --> 25:56.671
WE HAVE AMY
AND ADAM HERE

25:56.706 --> 26:00.423
WHO WANT YOU
TO TALK TO THEM.

26:00.458 --> 26:02.960
SO NOW THAT
KATIE HAS KIND OF

26:02.995 --> 26:05.695
LET YOU KNOW
WHY WE'RE HERE,

26:05.730 --> 26:08.867
UM, DOES THAT MEAN
YOU'LL TALK TO US NOW?

26:10.935 --> 26:15.204
KNOCK FOR US, LIKE THIS.

26:15.239 --> 26:17.475
WE WOULD LOVE TO KNOW
WHAT YOUR NAME IS.

26:23.281 --> 26:26.685
I FELT, LIKE, BANGING
UNDERNEATH MY FEET.

26:31.056 --> 26:32.288
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

26:32.323 --> 26:34.459
I FELT IT RIGHT UNDER --
ON THE BOTTOM OF MY FEET.

26:43.001 --> 26:46.605
I FELT, LIKE,
BANGING UNDERNEATH MY FEET.

26:48.739 --> 26:50.608
I FELT IT RIGHT UNDER --
ON THE BOTTOM OF MY FEET,

26:50.643 --> 26:52.844
LIKE SOMEBODY
WAS HITTING.

26:52.879 --> 26:55.046
WHAT'S UNDER US?

26:55.081 --> 26:56.479
THE BASEMENT.

26:56.514 --> 26:58.015
LET'S CHECK THE BASEMENT,

26:58.016 --> 27:00.819
JUST SEE WHAT'S BELOW
WHERE YOU FELT THE THUMPING.

27:09.760 --> 27:12.697
IS THERE ANYTHING NEAR
THE CEILING YOU COULD'VE FELT?

27:12.732 --> 27:14.564
PROBABLY BE...

27:14.599 --> 27:16.634
COULD IT HAVE BEEN
THAT VENT UP THERE?

27:16.669 --> 27:18.536
NO, IT'S THIS.

27:18.571 --> 27:19.669
NO.

27:19.704 --> 27:21.438
IT DIDN'T MAKE A SOUND,
WHATEVER YOU FELT.

27:21.439 --> 27:22.638
IT JUST --
- VIBRATION.

27:22.673 --> 27:26.193
SO, ARE WE RIGHT
UNDER THE COUCHES NOW?

27:26.228 --> 27:29.714
THAT COUCH WOULD BE
RIGHT ABOUT HERE.

27:29.749 --> 27:31.447
YEAH.
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING

27:31.482 --> 27:33.184
THAT COULD EXPLAIN
WHAT YOU FELT.

27:33.219 --> 27:34.851
- NO, NOT AT ALL.
- OKAY.

27:34.852 --> 27:37.754
WELL, ALL RIGHT,
WELL, LET'S HEAD UP.

27:37.789 --> 27:40.291
HOPEFULLY SOMETHING
WILL START TALKING TO US.

27:43.727 --> 27:46.664
SOMETHING -- SOMEBODY'S
TRYING TO GET OUR ATTENTION.

27:46.699 --> 27:50.634
SO, LET'S START AGAIN.
OOPS.

27:53.972 --> 27:57.008
ARE YOU THE SHADOWS
THAT WE SEE UPSTAIRS?

27:59.043 --> 28:02.847
IF YOU'RE HERE,
ARE THERE OTHERS HERE

28:02.882 --> 28:06.651
IN THE HOUSE
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW?

28:06.686 --> 28:09.187
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

28:13.924 --> 28:15.226
<i> OKAY.</i>

28:30.375 --> 28:31.376
I'M SORRY, WHAT?

28:31.411 --> 28:32.844
WHAT?

28:39.784 --> 28:41.952
"MILTON."
HE'S SAYING "MILTON."

28:41.987 --> 28:44.089
PLAY THAT AGAIN.

28:46.524 --> 28:47.691
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT IT SAID.

28:47.692 --> 28:48.758
THAT'S EXACTLY IT!

28:48.793 --> 28:50.194
I MEAN, THAT'S CLEARLY
SAYING "MILTON."

28:50.229 --> 28:51.160
- YEAH.
- "MILTON."

28:51.195 --> 28:52.529
- IT'S SAYING "MILTON."
- "MILTON."

28:52.564 --> 28:54.298
THAT ONE WAS A BIG ONE.

28:54.333 --> 28:55.998
THAT WAS HUGE.
WE HEARD "MILTON."

28:56.033 --> 28:59.269
AFTER GETTING NOTHING SPECIFIC,
NOTHING ON NATIVE AMERICANS,

28:59.304 --> 29:01.106
WE FINALLY GOT A NAME.

29:05.075 --> 29:07.143
THAT'S A VERY DEEP VOICE.

29:07.178 --> 29:09.581
YEAH, IT DEFINITELY
SOUNDS LIKE A MALE VOICE.

29:09.616 --> 29:10.546
RIGHT.

29:10.581 --> 29:11.748
SO WE FOUND
IN OUR RESEARCH

29:11.783 --> 29:13.717
THAT ONE OF THE PREVIOUS
PROPERTY OWNERS

29:13.718 --> 29:15.684
WAS A MAN NAMED MILTON.
- YEAH?

29:15.719 --> 29:21.592
HE LIVED IN THIS TOWN
SINCE, LIKE, 1910 OR SOMETHING.

29:22.727 --> 29:25.012
SO, I MEAN, HE WAS
VERY WELL-ESTABLISHED.

29:25.047 --> 29:27.298
HE LIVED HERE
LONGER THAN ANYONE ELSE.

29:27.333 --> 29:28.666
I WONDER
WHY HE'S STILL HERE.

29:28.701 --> 29:30.266
UM, WE HEAR YOU.

29:30.301 --> 29:32.419
YOU'RE COMING THROUGH
LOUD AND CLEAR.

29:32.454 --> 29:34.538
CAN YOU JUST TELL US
FOR SURE, YOU ARE --

29:34.573 --> 29:37.008
ARE YOU MILTON?

29:38.976 --> 29:40.677
ARE YOU STILL HERE?

29:40.712 --> 29:42.646
I SAW THAT.

29:42.681 --> 29:44.581
WHAT WAS THAT?
- A SHADOW.

29:47.785 --> 29:48.784
WAS THAT IT?

29:48.819 --> 29:50.622
- THAT WAS A SHADOW.
- REALLY?

29:52.389 --> 29:56.761
THAT WAS FAST.
THAT ONE WAS A FAST ONE.

29:56.796 --> 29:58.196
AND WE HAVE IT RECORDED.

29:58.231 --> 29:59.495
I SAW THAT.

29:59.530 --> 30:01.432
AND I WAS LOOKING RIGHT
OUT THERE WHEN IT HAPPENED.

30:01.467 --> 30:03.400
IT WAS LIKE THE FLASH
JUST RAN BY THE HOUSE.

30:03.435 --> 30:05.735
CAN YOU SEE ANYTHING
ON THE DVR CAMERA?

30:05.770 --> 30:08.539
IT'S SO FAST, YOU GUYS.
LIKE, IT IS SO FAST.

30:08.574 --> 30:09.991
I DIDN'T EVEN SEE
WHAT DIRECTION.

30:10.026 --> 30:11.408
I JUST SAW SOMETHING GO,
WHOOSH,

30:11.409 --> 30:13.343
LIKE, OUT OF
THE CORNER OF MY EYE.

30:13.378 --> 30:16.312
WE CAN REVIEW THIS LATER,
BUT WE NEED TO KEEP GOING.

30:16.313 --> 30:19.316
IT WAS DEF--
IT WAS DEFINITELY NOT A CAR.

30:19.351 --> 30:22.285
IT WAS NOT A BUG.
IT WAS NOT AN ANIMAL.

30:22.320 --> 30:25.856
IT WAS A FULL FIGURE
THAT BOLTED BY THIS WINDOW.

30:25.891 --> 30:28.124
AND I SAW IT.

30:28.159 --> 30:29.894
ADAM SAW IT.
KATIE SAW IT.

30:29.929 --> 30:31.994
WE ALL SAW IT.

30:32.029 --> 30:33.462
THAT'S BIZARRE.
- THAT'S BIZARRE.

30:33.497 --> 30:35.199
HERE, LET'S TALK TO HIM MORE
AND SEE IF WE CAN GET MORE.

30:35.234 --> 30:37.333
YEAH.

30:37.368 --> 30:39.604
ARE YOU TRYING
TO GET OUR ATTENTION?

30:42.506 --> 30:45.877
WHAT IS IT THAT
YOU NEED FROM US?

30:47.945 --> 30:51.216
WHY ARE YOU
STILL HERE?

30:55.186 --> 30:57.120
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

30:57.121 --> 30:58.672
WHAT WAS THAT?

30:58.707 --> 31:00.189
SOMETHING MOVED.

31:00.224 --> 31:02.091
ALMOST LIKE A FOOTSTEP.

31:02.126 --> 31:05.363
CAN YOU KNOCK AGAIN OR --
OR DO WHATEVER YOU JUST DID?

31:11.687 --> 31:13.469
THAT WAS IT.

31:13.504 --> 31:15.773
SOUNDED LIKE IT
CAME FROM UPSTAIRS.

31:15.808 --> 31:18.042
I THOUGHT IT WAS
RIGHT UPSTAIRS,

31:18.077 --> 31:19.343
THAT WAY.

31:22.679 --> 31:23.897
WHAT WAS THAT SHADOW?

31:23.932 --> 31:25.091
- WHAT?
- OUTSIDE?

31:25.126 --> 31:26.215
- YES.
- I SAW IT, TOO.

31:26.250 --> 31:28.018
AND I SAW IT
ON THIS WINDOW.

31:28.053 --> 31:29.787
IT WAS LIKE
IT SWOOPED DOWN.

31:29.822 --> 31:32.257
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

31:44.202 --> 31:47.005
SOUNDED LIKE IT
CAME FROM UPSTAIRS.

31:50.474 --> 31:51.842
WHAT WAS THAT SHADOW?

31:54.245 --> 31:55.545
- WHAT?
- OUTSIDE?

31:55.546 --> 31:57.631
- YES.
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

31:57.666 --> 31:59.716
SOMETHING CAME THROUGH.

31:59.717 --> 32:02.118
I SAW THE SHADOW.
IT CAME OVER.

32:02.153 --> 32:03.587
I SAW IT START
ON THAT LITTLE WINDOW.

32:03.622 --> 32:06.057
- RIGHT TO LEFT?
- YEP.

32:06.092 --> 32:08.457
DID WE CATCH IT
ON THE DVR?

32:08.492 --> 32:11.029
IS THIS THING,
LIKE, NOT ON RIGHT NOW?

32:13.530 --> 32:15.600
HOW LONG
HAS THIS BEEN DARK?

32:15.635 --> 32:19.268
WHAT IS GOING ON?

32:19.303 --> 32:21.672
I JUST PLUGGED IT BACK IN,
AND IT CAME RIGHT BACK ON.

32:21.707 --> 32:24.141
BUT IT WAS DARK.
THE SCREEN WAS DARK.

32:24.176 --> 32:25.842
DO YOU THINK
THAT WAS MILTON?

32:25.877 --> 32:28.378
WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO MILTON.
WE SAW A SHADOW.

32:28.413 --> 32:30.245
WE HEARD A KNOCK UPSTAIRS.

32:30.280 --> 32:32.649
WHY DON'T WE GO UPSTAIRS AND SEE
IF ANYTHING'S OUT OF PLACE,

32:32.650 --> 32:33.785
'CAUSE WE HEARD
THAT NOISE.

32:36.587 --> 32:38.521
KNOWING YOUR HOUSE...
- YES.

32:38.556 --> 32:40.557
...WHERE DO YOU THINK
THAT SOUND CAME FROM?

32:40.592 --> 32:42.091
I WOULD SAY
IT PROBABLY CAME

32:42.126 --> 32:43.895
RIGHT FROM THE TOP
OF THE STAIRS.

32:43.930 --> 32:46.481
OKAY.
LET'S, UM...

32:46.516 --> 32:49.033
WAS IT LIKE THIS?

32:51.068 --> 32:53.003
LIKE A...

32:53.038 --> 32:55.706
ALMOST LIKE...

32:55.707 --> 32:58.175
GO DOWNSTAIRS.
I WANNA TRY SOMETHING.

32:58.210 --> 32:59.976
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GO DOWN.

33:00.011 --> 33:02.613
YOU BOTH GO DOWN
AND LISTEN TO THIS.

33:02.648 --> 33:04.715
'CAUSE, I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST...

33:04.750 --> 33:06.783
WE'RE GONNA SIT
WHERE WE SAT.

33:06.784 --> 33:08.786
YES.
TELL ME WHEN YOU'RE READY,

33:08.821 --> 33:10.788
AND I'LL FUDGE AROUND
WITH STUFF.

33:10.823 --> 33:12.156
- OKAY. GO AHEAD.
- ALL RIGHT.

33:12.191 --> 33:14.091
THERE'S THIS.

33:16.894 --> 33:18.663
DO IT AGAIN.

33:20.097 --> 33:21.263
THAT WAS CLOSE.

33:21.298 --> 33:23.433
OKAY. WAIT.
LET'S TRY THIS.

33:23.468 --> 33:25.787
IMAGINE SOMETHING'S
RUSHING OUTSIDE,

33:25.822 --> 33:28.106
ABOUT TO TRY TO GET
OUT OF HERE.

33:29.559 --> 33:30.884
YEAH.

33:30.919 --> 33:32.209
YES.

33:32.210 --> 33:33.427
DIDN'T THAT SOUND
LIKE IT?

33:33.462 --> 33:34.610
- YES.
- THIS IS YOUR PICTURE

33:34.645 --> 33:37.048
RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM
OF THE STAIRS.

33:38.301 --> 33:39.415
- YEP.
- YEP.

33:39.450 --> 33:40.450
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT.
- THAT'S IT.

33:40.485 --> 33:41.750
I MEAN, EVEN SOFTER,

33:41.785 --> 33:45.356
BUT, LIKE, A TINY, LITTLE,
LIKE, WIND KIND OF THING.

33:45.391 --> 33:48.176
LIKE, IMAGINE
SOMETHING'S, LIKE,

33:48.211 --> 33:50.961
GOING OUT THIS DOOR,
RUSHING PAST.

33:50.996 --> 33:52.195
I BET THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

33:52.230 --> 33:54.581
I MEAN, IT'S A VERY STRANGE
SEQUENCE OF EVENTS,

33:54.616 --> 33:56.933
BUT BASICALLY I FEEL LIKE
WHATEVER WAS HERE

33:56.968 --> 33:58.334
CAME DOWN THE STAIRS,

33:58.369 --> 34:00.170
RUSHED OUT,
RAN ACROSS THE PORCH,

34:00.171 --> 34:01.571
MOVED THIS
ON THE WAY OUT.

34:01.606 --> 34:02.571
- RIGHT.
- YEAH.

34:02.606 --> 34:03.608
AND THEN YOU GUYS
SAW THE SHADOW.

34:03.643 --> 34:06.575
YEAH.

34:06.610 --> 34:07.910
DO YOU WANNA LISTEN
TO THIS NOW?

34:07.911 --> 34:10.447
YEAH.
LET'S LISTEN TO THAT.

34:25.129 --> 34:26.730
- WHAT?
- WHAT?

34:33.036 --> 34:34.138
"IT'S MY HOME."

34:34.172 --> 34:35.237
YEAH.

34:35.272 --> 34:36.440
- "IT'S MY HOME."
- "IT'S MY HOME."

34:42.079 --> 34:44.047
I HAD TO SIT BACK FOR THAT.
THAT'S A LOT.

34:44.081 --> 34:45.045
THAT WAS A LOT.

34:45.081 --> 34:47.750
I NEED TO, LIKE,
TAKE IT IN FOR A SECOND.

34:47.751 --> 34:50.085
MILTON --
MILTON HAD SOMETHING TO SAY.

34:50.121 --> 34:52.853
HE VERY CLEARLY TOLD US,
"THIS IS MY HOME."

34:52.889 --> 34:56.426
MILTON OWNED THIS PROPERTY
FOR MANY, MANY YEARS.

34:56.427 --> 34:58.093
THIS IS HIS HOME TO HIM.

34:58.128 --> 35:00.364
HE PROBABLY SPENT THE LAST
OF HIS YEARS IN THIS --

35:00.399 --> 35:01.663
IN THIS SPACE.

35:01.698 --> 35:04.335
AND THIS WOULDN'T HAVE
HAPPENED WITHOUT KATIE.

35:04.370 --> 35:06.636
I WILL TELL YOU,
LAST NIGHT,

35:06.671 --> 35:10.374
WE JUST WEREN'T GETTING
ANYTHING THAT MATCHED ANYTHING.

35:10.409 --> 35:12.942
IT'S ANOTHER REASON
WHY WE BRING IN SOMEONE

35:12.943 --> 35:14.376
WHO'S CONNECTED
TO THE HOUSE,

35:14.411 --> 35:18.149
BECAUSE YOU BEING HERE
IS THE CATALYST FOR HIM

35:18.184 --> 35:20.750
WANTING TO COMMUNICATE.

35:20.751 --> 35:22.186
WE STILL HAVE A LOT
OF WORK TO DO,

35:22.221 --> 35:24.121
LITTLE THINGS
TO FIGURE OUT.

35:24.156 --> 35:25.120
OKAY.

35:25.155 --> 35:26.389
BUT I THINK, WITHOUT YOU,

35:26.424 --> 35:28.058
WE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO START THIS EVENING

35:28.093 --> 35:30.094
THE WAY IT DID.
- YEAH.

35:38.236 --> 35:40.002
DID YOU TAKE A CLOSER LOOK
AT THE DVR FOOTAGE?

35:40.003 --> 35:42.538
YEAH.
CHECK THIS OUT.

35:42.573 --> 35:44.139
YEAH, IT'S GOTTA BE
RIGHT HERE.

35:44.174 --> 35:46.811
<i> -WAS THAT IT?</i>

35:48.245 --> 35:51.082
WAIT.
PLAY IT AGAIN.

36:04.962 --> 36:08.132
<i> MILTON,
ARE YOU STILL HERE?</i>

36:08.167 --> 36:09.932
WAIT.
PLAY IT AGAIN.

36:09.967 --> 36:11.969
I SAW MOVEMENT
FOR A SECOND.

36:12.004 --> 36:13.135
IT'S WEIRD.

36:13.170 --> 36:16.841
YOU CAN SEE A LITTLE FLASH
RIGHT THERE FOR A SECOND.

36:16.876 --> 36:17.940
<i> MILTON.</i>

36:17.975 --> 36:20.644
IT'S WEIRD,
BUT IT'S NOT A GHOST.

36:20.679 --> 36:21.610
IT'S DUST.

36:21.645 --> 36:23.580
THE FRAME RATE,
UNFORTUNATELY, IS...

36:23.615 --> 36:25.481
- IT'S TOO SLOW.
- ...A LITTLE SLOW.

36:25.516 --> 36:27.451
I DON'T THINK MANY DVR SYSTEMS
WOULD'VE CAUGHT THAT.

36:27.486 --> 36:28.584
I THINK IT'S CRAZY THAT,

36:28.619 --> 36:30.452
EVEN WHEN WE HAD
OUR CAMERA FACING

36:30.487 --> 36:32.990
TOWARD A SHADOW THAT RAN BY,
IT STILL DIDN'T GET IT.

36:33.025 --> 36:34.357
- RIGHT.
- AND THE NICE THING

36:34.392 --> 36:36.092
ABOUT HAVING
THIS FOOTAGE, THOUGH,

36:36.127 --> 36:38.729
IS WE CAN SEE THAT, INDEED,
THERE WAS NOBODY OUT THERE.

36:38.764 --> 36:40.098
NOPE.
THERE'S NOBODY MOVING.

36:40.133 --> 36:41.682
NO.
EVERYBODY'S PERFECTLY STILL.

36:41.717 --> 36:43.232
THIS THING FLIES
DOWN THE STAIRS.

36:43.233 --> 36:44.533
KATIE AND I BOTH SAW IT.

36:44.568 --> 36:47.838
SO WHAT'S THE DIAGNOSIS?
LET'S SEE THE DIAGNOSIS HERE.

36:47.873 --> 36:49.440
UM, I THINK
THE DIAGNOSIS IS CLEAR.

36:49.475 --> 36:50.406
MILTON.

36:50.441 --> 36:51.609
- MILTON IS HERE.
- RIGHT.

36:51.644 --> 36:52.976
-100%.
- IT'S MILTON.

36:53.011 --> 36:54.612
WE HAVE A NAME.

36:57.314 --> 36:59.716
- THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS.
- THAT'S EXACTLY IT!

36:59.751 --> 37:01.685
AND THE "THIS IS MY HOME" EVP.

37:05.455 --> 37:06.889
"IT'S MY HOME."

37:06.924 --> 37:09.459
AND WE SAW THE SHADOW FIGURE
WHEN WE WERE TALKING TO HIM.

37:09.494 --> 37:10.845
ARE YOU STILL HERE?

37:10.880 --> 37:12.196
WHAT WAS THAT?

37:12.231 --> 37:13.429
SHADOW.

37:13.464 --> 37:15.297
YOU KNOW, HE'S VERY ATTACHED
TO THIS PLACE.

37:15.332 --> 37:17.818
HE WAS VERY ESTABLISHED HERE.
- RIGHT. OF COURSE.

37:17.853 --> 37:20.304
IT'S ONE OF THOSE CASES
WHERE IT COULD'VE BEEN

37:20.339 --> 37:21.837
A BILLION
DIFFERENT THINGS.

37:21.872 --> 37:23.807
IT DID NOT COME EASY.
- IT DIDN'T.

37:23.842 --> 37:25.141
AND, YOU KNOW,
WE HAVE A LOT

37:25.176 --> 37:26.744
TO TELL THEM ABOUT
THE NATIVE AMERICAN HISTORY,

37:26.779 --> 37:28.044
WHICH IS INTERESTING.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.545
I WOULDN'T ELIMINATE THAT.

37:29.580 --> 37:32.016
I WOULD JUST SAY,
WITH EVERYTHING WE DID,

37:32.051 --> 37:33.968
THEY DIDN'T TALK TO US.
- TALK TO US.

37:34.003 --> 37:35.851
HOWEVER, MILTON
MADE HIMSELF VERY CLEAR.

37:35.886 --> 37:38.622
I JUST THINK IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT THEY REALIZE HE'S HERE

37:38.657 --> 37:40.658
BECAUSE HE LOVES THE PLACE,
NOT BECAUSE HE MEANS

37:40.693 --> 37:42.191
TO HARM ANYBODY.
- RIGHT.

37:42.226 --> 37:43.927
GRANDMA GETTING PUSHED
DOWN THE STAIRS

37:43.962 --> 37:45.293
WAS PROBABLY
JUST AN ACCIDENT

37:45.328 --> 37:47.163
BECAUSE NONE OF THE ACTIVITY
IS REMOTELY PHYSICAL.

37:47.198 --> 37:48.999
I'M EXCITED TO AT LEAST
SHARE THIS INFORMATION.

37:49.034 --> 37:50.567
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S DO IT.

37:52.269 --> 37:54.337
WE CAN SAY
RIGHT OFF THE BAT,

37:54.338 --> 37:55.738
AFTER HAVING
INVESTIGATED

37:55.773 --> 37:57.674
AND SPENT TIME HERE
AND DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH,

37:57.709 --> 38:02.279
THAT WHATEVER'S HERE IS --
IS NOT DARK.

38:02.314 --> 38:05.013
BUT THERE IS
SOMETHING HERE.

38:05.048 --> 38:08.218
WE BELIEVE THE GHOST IS
MILTON, THE PREVIOUS LANDOWNER.

38:08.219 --> 38:10.420
MILTON OWNED THIS
ENTIRE PROPERTY.

38:10.455 --> 38:11.620
YES. YEAH.

38:11.655 --> 38:15.993
HE PROBABLY LOVES THIS LAND
AS MUCH AS YOU DO.

38:16.028 --> 38:17.395
AND THAT'S WHY
HE DOESN'T WANNA LEAVE.

38:17.430 --> 38:18.894
YOU KNOW, THIS IS HIS LAND,

38:18.929 --> 38:21.815
THIS IS HIS HOME AND, YOU KNOW,
WHERE HE WANTS TO STAY.

38:21.850 --> 38:24.710
AND I'M GUESSING, BECAUSE HE
PASSED AWAY IN THIS AREA,

38:24.745 --> 38:27.571
HE PROBABLY RETIRED HERE
AND SPENT THE LAST OF HIS YEARS

38:27.606 --> 38:30.005
IN THIS SPACE.
- REALLY?

38:30.040 --> 38:33.244
WE DID GET AN EVP
THAT WE WANNA SHOW YOU.

38:36.180 --> 38:37.346
- "MILTON."
- "MILTON."

38:37.381 --> 38:38.915
AND WE ALSO SAW
THE SHADOW FIGURE LAST NIGHT

38:38.950 --> 38:40.683
WHILE THIS WAS HAPPENING.

38:40.684 --> 38:42.135
- YOU SAW THE SHADOW?
-100%.

38:42.170 --> 38:43.552
YEAH.
WE SAW IT OURSELVES.

38:43.587 --> 38:45.987
SHE AND I SAW
A SHADOW ON THE PORCH.

38:46.022 --> 38:48.426
AND, RIGHT THEN,
WE HEAR THIS KIND OF THUD --

38:48.461 --> 38:52.395
THUD ON THE WALL,
ON THE STAIRCASE.

38:52.430 --> 38:54.064
IT WAS THE PICTURE FRAME
THAT'S SITTING THERE.

38:54.099 --> 38:56.000
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE
IT ZIPPED PAST.

38:56.035 --> 38:56.999
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

38:57.034 --> 38:58.435
SO WE THINK MAYBE
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED

38:58.470 --> 38:59.568
TO YOUR MOM ON THE STAIRS.

38:59.603 --> 39:02.005
MILTON BRUSHED BY
BY ACCIDENT AND PUSHED HER.

39:02.040 --> 39:04.408
- WOW. THAT'S AMAZING.
- YEAH, ISN'T IT WILD?

39:04.443 --> 39:05.709
- THAT'S AMAZING.
- IT'S SO WILD, RIGHT?

39:05.744 --> 39:07.228
JUST LIKE JUST A SNAP
OF A FINGER,

39:07.263 --> 39:08.571
AND YOU JUST PUT IT
ALL TOGETHER.

39:08.606 --> 39:09.845
AND TOGETHER WE FIGURED OUT

39:09.880 --> 39:12.182
THE NOISES THAT BARRY WAS
HEARING WAS BARRED OWLS.

39:12.217 --> 39:14.350
LET'S BE VERY -- BARRED OWLS.

39:14.351 --> 39:16.269
WE DISCOVERED THAT
IT'S BARRED OWLS.

39:16.304 --> 39:18.153
IT'S THE CRAZY SOUND
OF BARRED OWLS

39:18.188 --> 39:21.057
THAT MAKE KIND OF THE
"MONKEY SOUNDS" OUT THE WINDOW.

39:21.092 --> 39:23.060
I WAS WATCHING HIS FACE
WHEN YOU PLAYED THAT,

39:23.095 --> 39:24.426
AND HE LIT RIGHT UP.
- RIGHT.

39:24.461 --> 39:26.930
AND WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW --
PLEASE TELL THEM YOUR STORY.

39:26.965 --> 39:29.332
ON THE WAY HOME -- I DIDN'T KNOW
UNTIL HE TOLD ME

39:29.333 --> 39:31.433
AND HE SHOWED ME A PHOTO
OF A BARRED OWL --

39:31.468 --> 39:34.770
ON OUR WAY -- WHEN I DROVE BACK
TO THE HOTEL THAT NIGHT,

39:34.771 --> 39:36.672
I SAW ONE
ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD

39:36.707 --> 39:38.508
JUST, LIKE, STANDING,
LIKE SITTING THERE.

39:38.543 --> 39:40.310
I THINK IT WAS --
IT WAS JUST SITTING THERE,

39:40.311 --> 39:41.778
LIKE LOOKING AROUND,
AND I'M LIKE,

39:41.813 --> 39:43.211
"WHAT IS THIS OWL
DOING HERE?"

39:43.246 --> 39:45.182
I'VE NEVER SEEN -- I MEAN,
I'VE SEEN AN OWL IN THE WILD

39:45.217 --> 39:46.549
TWICE MAYBE.

39:46.550 --> 39:48.485
SO AS FAR AS FOR WHAT
THE PSYCHIC SAID,

39:48.520 --> 39:49.885
YOU GUYS KNOW ABOUT --

39:49.920 --> 39:51.755
YOU OBVIOUSLY KNOW ABOUT THE
GRAVE DOWN HERE BY THE CHURCH.

39:51.790 --> 39:53.756
- YES.
- IT'S A NATIVE AMERICAN.

39:53.791 --> 39:56.326
HE'S 7-FOOT-TALL, APPARENTLY,
AND HE'S IN THE GROUND,

39:56.361 --> 39:58.862
WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN WHAT
THE PSYCHIC WAS PICKING UP ON.

39:58.897 --> 40:01.798
I CAN TELL YOU THAT,
WHILE WE INVESTIGATED,

40:01.833 --> 40:04.066
WE DIDN'T FIND
ANYTHING RELATED

40:04.067 --> 40:06.353
TO A NATIVE AMERICAN SPIRIT
IN YOUR HOME.

40:06.388 --> 40:08.639
THAT'S NOT TO SAY
THAT THEY ARE NOT HERE.

40:08.674 --> 40:10.275
IT'S JUST MIGHT BE
THEY CHOSE

40:10.310 --> 40:11.841
NOT TO INTERACT WITH US.
- SURE.

40:11.876 --> 40:15.645
BUT WE KNOW THAT MILTON
IS THE ENTITY IN YOUR HOME.

40:15.680 --> 40:16.778
WOW.

40:16.813 --> 40:17.947
AFTER ALL THAT,

40:17.982 --> 40:20.884
WHAT DO YOU THINK
EMILY'S GONNA THINK OF THIS?

40:20.919 --> 40:22.518
THAT PUTS A LITTLE BIT
OF THE --

40:22.553 --> 40:26.957
THE ANSWERS TO WHAT'S GOING ON,
YOU KNOW, IN PERSPECTIVE.

40:26.992 --> 40:28.657
NOT AN EVIL-TYPE THING.

40:28.692 --> 40:32.596
DO YOU THINK EMILY'S GONNA
SLEEP BETTER NOW, OR...?

40:32.631 --> 40:34.129
- I THINK SO.
- WE'LL SEE.

40:34.164 --> 40:36.431
AS FAR AS THE CO-SLEEPING GOES,
IT'S SOMETHING --

40:36.466 --> 40:40.720
THE BEST WAY IS REALLY TO
JUST GRADUALLY PHASE THAT OUT.

40:40.755 --> 40:44.466
IF IT KEEPS HAPPENING,
YOU MIGHT WANNA, LIKE, CONSULT

40:44.501 --> 40:48.178
WITH A SLEEP THERAPIST
OR DO A SLEEP STUDY ON HER.

40:48.213 --> 40:49.478
- SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
- YEAH.

40:49.513 --> 40:51.048
WHATEVER'S BOTHERING HER,
YOU KNOW, SHE CAN SAY,

40:51.083 --> 40:52.515
"HEY, MILTON, STOP."
- YEAH.

40:52.516 --> 40:54.735
- YOU KNOW, SHE'S GOT A NAME NOW.
- YEAH.

40:54.770 --> 40:56.919
THIS INVESTIGATION
STARTED OUT ROCKY,

40:56.954 --> 40:59.823
BUT WE WERE FINALLY ABLE TO
GIVE THIS FAMILY SOME ANSWERS.

40:59.858 --> 41:02.926
THANKS FOR HANGING OUT
IN YOUR ROOM WITH US.

41:02.961 --> 41:04.259
UM, WE JUST WANTED
TO BRING YOU UP HERE

41:04.260 --> 41:06.864
AND TELL YOU THAT,
WHILE WE WERE INVESTIGATING,

41:06.899 --> 41:08.564
WE SAW THE SHADOW OURSELVES.

41:08.599 --> 41:10.584
WHILE WE WERE INVESTIGATING
WITH YOUR MOM,

41:10.619 --> 41:12.569
WE SAW THE SHADOW GO
RIGHT ACROSS THE PORCH.

41:12.604 --> 41:14.337
SO WE SAW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU SAW.

41:14.338 --> 41:18.742
WE'VE NOT SEEN
OR FOUND ANYTHING

41:18.777 --> 41:20.976
THAT MEANS ANY HARM TO YOU.

41:21.011 --> 41:23.214
SO HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW?
I MEAN, 'CAUSE, OBVIOUSLY,

41:23.249 --> 41:25.483
WE TOLD YOU YOU HAVE
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

41:25.518 --> 41:27.683
YOU SHOULD BE OKAY
AND SAFE IN THIS SPACE.

41:27.718 --> 41:31.721
I FEEL A LITTLE BIT SAFER NOW,
BUT NOT, LIKE, THE BEST.

41:31.722 --> 41:33.190
- YEAH.
- IT'LL TAKE SOME TIME.

41:33.225 --> 41:34.223
- IT WILL.
- KAY.

41:34.258 --> 41:35.824
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, I GOT YOU A JOURNAL.

41:35.859 --> 41:38.495
AND WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO,
JUST SPEND A LITTLE TIME UP HERE

41:38.530 --> 41:39.828
AND JUST THINK
ABOUT YOUR DAY

41:39.829 --> 41:41.866
AND THINK ABOUT THE GOOD THINGS
THAT HAPPENED.

41:41.901 --> 41:43.666
AND SO THEN YOU'LL HAVE
THIS LITTLE BOOK

41:43.701 --> 41:45.133
THAT YOU CAN LOOK BACK ON
ONE DAY

41:45.168 --> 41:47.237
AND ALWAYS REMEMBER
BEING IN THIS ROOM,

41:47.272 --> 41:49.540
THINKING
OF THE HAPPIEST THINGS.

41:49.575 --> 41:51.808
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

41:51.843 --> 41:53.443
- I LIKE IT.
- YEAH? GOOD.

41:53.478 --> 41:55.880
I'M GLAD.
- IT'S COOL.

41:55.915 --> 41:57.746
GOOD.

41:57.781 --> 41:59.247
EMILY CAN BREATHE
A LITTLE EASIER

41:59.282 --> 42:02.352
NOW THAT SHE KNOWS
MILTON MEANS NO HARM.

42:02.387 --> 42:03.819
IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME,

42:03.820 --> 42:07.391
BUT SHE'S ON THE RIGHT PATH
TO RECLAIMING HER OWN SPACE.

42:11.829 --> 42:13.947
Hey, Amy and Adam.
This is Katie.

42:13.982 --> 42:16.066
I just wanted to give
you guys an update.

42:16.101 --> 42:17.732
I am just so excited to say

42:17.767 --> 42:21.805
that Emily has been
sleeping in her own room

42:21.840 --> 42:24.340
every night by herself.

42:24.375 --> 42:27.244
I cannot thank you guys
enough for this.

42:27.279 --> 42:30.113
It has lifted a big weight
off my shoulders.

42:30.148 --> 42:32.149
You guys did great.
