00:00.001 --> 00:04.570
<i>Previously on</i> Reign...
Once the rest
of the Spanish Armada arrives,

00:04.572 --> 00:06.071
I will take the throne.
Nicole, run away with me.

00:06.073 --> 00:08.440
You will be my queen.
I'm yours.

00:08.442 --> 00:10.442
Your sons are fighting
over a girl.

00:10.444 --> 00:14.313
I understand you're a witch.
Maybe you could help me.

00:14.315 --> 00:16.749
Francis Drake, I trust
you have good news.

00:16.751 --> 00:18.651
We sunk two warships.

00:18.652 --> 00:20.552
King Philip has always
desired England.

00:20.554 --> 00:22.321
And now he has grounds for war.

00:22.323 --> 00:23.589
Have you taken any lovers

00:23.591 --> 00:24.623
with syphilis?

00:24.625 --> 00:26.325
I've seen men with that.

00:26.327 --> 00:29.061
The-the-- the lesions
all over their body,

00:29.063 --> 00:30.329
the-the madness.

00:30.331 --> 00:33.032
You need to see a doctor
immediately.

00:33.034 --> 00:34.767
In a state
of emergency,

00:34.769 --> 00:36.635
a privy council
can be installed

00:36.637 --> 00:39.338
by a royal signature.
You are still king.

00:39.340 --> 00:41.740
You can assemble a privy council
that supports you.

00:41.742 --> 00:43.509
DARNLEY: There is a motion
being passed

00:43.511 --> 00:46.478
tomorrow, in front of
the privy council to appoint me

00:46.480 --> 00:48.213
the child's steward.
No.

00:48.215 --> 00:52.084
I will have the power to
keep you out of my son's life.

00:52.086 --> 00:54.119
MARY:
<i> Dear Elizabeth, I ask</i>

00:54.121 --> 00:55.587
<i> that should anything</i>
<i> happen to me,</i>

00:55.589 --> 00:57.756
<i> you will protect my child</i>
<i> as your own.</i>

00:57.758 --> 00:59.091
I am your king.

00:59.092 --> 01:00.425
I wish to be alone
with my child.

01:02.196 --> 01:03.262
MARY: Darnley's
taken my son!

01:03.264 --> 01:05.431
(sniffles)

01:25.119 --> 01:26.385
Step aside.

01:26.387 --> 01:27.653
All right, here
we go in there.

01:27.655 --> 01:29.621
(overlapping shouting)

01:29.623 --> 01:31.323
You're known associates
of King Darnley.

01:31.325 --> 01:33.826
He was educated
with my husband.

01:33.828 --> 01:35.828
When was the last time
you saw the king?

01:35.830 --> 01:37.830
Over a year ago, why?

01:37.832 --> 01:39.364
We're looking for a baby.
If you have one

01:39.366 --> 01:41.233
and he isn't yours,
you'll hang for it.

01:41.235 --> 01:43.102
Unless you cooperate.

01:43.104 --> 01:45.137
♪ ♪

01:47.741 --> 01:49.475
MARY:
It was freezing last night.

01:49.477 --> 01:50.809
They must have
taken shelter somewhere.

01:50.811 --> 01:52.511
And Darnley
is recognizable,

01:52.513 --> 01:53.879
at least to some.

01:53.881 --> 01:55.470
We're looking everywhere

01:55.471 --> 01:57.060
and he hasn't had much
of a head start.

01:57.061 --> 01:58.650
Then where is he?
Where is my child?

01:58.652 --> 01:59.818
We will find him.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.220
Your son will
be well and

02:01.222 --> 02:02.287
back in your arms in no time.

02:02.289 --> 02:03.522
I pray that you are right,

02:03.524 --> 02:05.824
but Darnley is sick,
his mind is...

02:05.826 --> 02:07.226
He's still the boy's father.

02:07.228 --> 02:08.894
A fact he's counting on
for his survival.

02:08.895 --> 02:10.561
Do you honestly think he intends
to raise the child?

02:10.564 --> 02:12.531
He who holds the heir
holds the power.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.299
I'm afraid that Darnley
might harm him,

02:14.301 --> 02:16.768
because he's not...
thinking clearly.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.537
Or perhaps because he is.

02:18.539 --> 02:21.673
Darnley told me once,
he saw a child

02:21.675 --> 02:23.842
as his replacement.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.644
That he would be no longer
be needed.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.913
I, too, used to think
of a child

02:27.915 --> 02:29.848
as a form of power.

02:29.850 --> 02:32.551
Something I could deliver
that Elizabeth couldn't.

02:32.553 --> 02:34.653
An heir to secure my reign.

02:36.557 --> 02:40.592
But as soon as I laid eyes
on him, all of that went away.

02:40.594 --> 02:42.594
And nothing mattered
more than his happiness,

02:42.596 --> 02:45.464
his safety.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.900
Bothwell, where is he?

02:49.870 --> 02:52.571
Where is my son?

02:52.573 --> 02:53.672
(sniffles)

02:58.812 --> 03:02.481
CATHERINE: Well, I'm glad that
your time in Scotland was...

03:02.483 --> 03:03.549
fruitful.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.350
Mm.
Tell me,
how was Mary?

03:05.352 --> 03:07.252
Struggling to maintain
her throne.

03:07.254 --> 03:08.487
Well, she knew
it wasn't going to be easy.

03:08.489 --> 03:10.289
There are struggles here,
as well.

03:10.291 --> 03:12.891
I heard that you
arrived back days ago.

03:12.893 --> 03:14.693
I had some personal business
to attend to.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.361
Guests staying at one
of my houses.

03:16.363 --> 03:17.663
(horse neighs outside)

03:17.665 --> 03:19.898
Well, be happy
they're not here at court,

03:19.900 --> 03:22.434
which has gone
to hell. (sighs)

03:22.436 --> 03:24.903
Henri has fled the castle
with his brother's fiancée.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.371
Nicole?

03:26.373 --> 03:28.674
Yes. Nicole.

03:28.676 --> 03:31.777
They're holed up in some ship
beyond the harbor.

03:31.779 --> 03:33.512
A Spanish warship,

03:33.514 --> 03:35.781
waiting for other
Spanish warships to attack,

03:35.783 --> 03:37.783
so he can take
his brother's throne.

03:37.785 --> 03:39.985
Dear God.
Spain would declare war?

03:39.987 --> 03:42.321
Well, I think they were hoping
for something quick and dirty,

03:42.323 --> 03:43.989
a single assault,

03:43.991 --> 03:46.525
toppling one king
and installing another.

03:46.527 --> 03:48.927
But it appears that Elizabeth
now has their attention,

03:48.929 --> 03:51.530
and the Armada
is now headed for England.

03:51.532 --> 03:54.866
Well, serves her right.
Crisis averted, all is well.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.935
Not quite.
Henri doesn't realize

03:56.937 --> 03:58.704
that the ships aren't coming.

03:58.706 --> 04:01.540
We can't get word to him
to tell him to give up,

04:01.542 --> 04:03.775
as there is inclement weather
along the coast.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.844
The fog is so thick
that our own ships

04:05.846 --> 04:07.346
could crash against the shoals.

04:07.348 --> 04:10.315
So with the fight
for the throne lost,

04:10.317 --> 04:13.585
all that lies between my sons
is Nicole.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.722
She is the one object
that they can hold onto

04:16.724 --> 04:18.023
as a cause for their feud;

04:18.025 --> 04:20.359
a feud that Charles
will never forgive

04:20.361 --> 04:23.829
and Henri will be too proud
to back down from.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.964
Unless...

04:25.966 --> 04:27.666
there's nothing left
to fight over.

04:27.668 --> 04:30.836
You're going to kill Nicole.

04:30.838 --> 04:32.804
It's already in motion.
But how? You said

04:32.806 --> 04:34.473
she's on a ship
that no one can get to.

04:34.475 --> 04:37.709
Someone can. Tell me.

04:38.812 --> 04:41.580
Do you believe in witches?

04:44.551 --> 04:46.385
Emanuelle,

04:46.387 --> 04:48.353
this is
Stephan Narcisse,

04:48.355 --> 04:50.355
he's the lord chancellor
of France.

04:50.357 --> 04:53.892
Stephan, this is a witch
that my pious daughter,

04:53.894 --> 04:56.461
Leeza, rounded up
amongst other heretics.

04:56.463 --> 04:59.564
I didn't care for her.
Clearly, you don't, either.

04:59.566 --> 05:01.366
Don't worry.

05:01.368 --> 05:03.001
Spain will still be a bother,

05:03.003 --> 05:06.338
but its queen won't be a problem
much longer.

05:06.340 --> 05:08.407
Complications
with her third child.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.877
A girl.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.845
Oh, you claim to have the gift
of seeing the future?

05:13.847 --> 05:15.013
It's no gift.

05:15.015 --> 05:17.349
Even I must pay a price.

05:17.351 --> 05:18.483
And have you settled
on yours?

05:18.485 --> 05:21.053
A thousand livre.

05:21.055 --> 05:22.754
My freedom.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.589
Is that all?

05:25.592 --> 05:26.992
Why did you bring him?

05:26.994 --> 05:29.528
Because I've had some dealing
with the occult.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.596
And I know that the devil
is often in the detail;

05:31.598 --> 05:35.033
the true cost
to the buyer a surprise.

05:35.035 --> 05:36.902
So if you have some toll

05:36.904 --> 05:40.505
you plan on extracting
at a later time, beware.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.407
I have very powerful friends.

05:42.409 --> 05:46.478
Nicole's inches from the grave.
She just doesn't know it yet.

05:46.480 --> 05:49.414
Then you'll have your money
and your freedom.

05:49.416 --> 05:51.450
There is one more thing.

05:52.419 --> 05:53.819
Meet me
tomorrow night.

05:53.821 --> 05:56.388
Someplace private.

05:56.390 --> 05:57.656
When the moon
is full.

05:57.658 --> 05:58.657
You come, too.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.559
For what reason?

06:00.561 --> 06:02.060
You'll see.

06:02.062 --> 06:05.397
Only then will your debt
to the darkness be paid.

06:07.101 --> 06:09.868
Where the hell is
the Spanish Armada?

06:09.870 --> 06:11.937
They should have
been here yesterday.

06:11.939 --> 06:14.606
(sighs)

06:14.608 --> 06:17.576
It's no good.
I need to think.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.811
You need to sleep.

06:19.813 --> 06:22.614
But if you can't do that,
will you at least eat?

06:24.785 --> 06:26.685
Supplies are running as thin
as this broth.

06:26.687 --> 06:27.853
Give me the flour.

06:27.855 --> 06:30.655
Gone,
as of this morning.

06:30.657 --> 06:33.392
Bad enough I'm serving
a prince fish stew.

06:33.394 --> 06:35.527
Eh, try this.

06:35.529 --> 06:38.463
A new, uh, delicacy from the
southern continent: nuts.

06:38.465 --> 06:40.432
It'll thicken it right up.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.104
We've even run out of venison.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.106
I think it's delicious.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.843
I could admit defeat,
but if Charles

06:51.845 --> 06:53.445
remains king,
he will force you to marry him.

06:53.447 --> 06:55.781
(clearing throat)

06:56.550 --> 06:57.682
(coughing)

06:57.684 --> 06:59.151
What's wrong?

06:59.153 --> 07:00.652
(coughs)

07:00.654 --> 07:03.855
(gasps, coughs)

07:03.857 --> 07:05.056
Nicole!

07:05.058 --> 07:06.725
Nicole!
(coughs)

07:06.727 --> 07:08.126
No. No, no, no, no.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.928
(gasps)

07:17.004 --> 07:19.137
Mary, I know the idea

07:19.139 --> 07:21.440
of closing your eyes
or taking caring of yourself

07:21.442 --> 07:23.141
is unbearable, but you must.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.677
Why did I take
my eyes off him?

07:25.679 --> 07:27.078
Because
you needed rest.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.614
You were depleted
after a brutal childbirth.

07:32.152 --> 07:33.485
James.

07:33.487 --> 07:35.487
I'm so happy to see you.

07:35.489 --> 07:36.755
Dearest sister.

07:37.858 --> 07:40.025
I'm happy to see you,
as well.

07:40.027 --> 07:41.893
James, I've
missed you.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.762
I sent for you a while ago,
did you not receive it?

07:43.764 --> 07:45.497
I was delayed
in the Hebrides.

07:45.499 --> 07:46.898
A significant land dispute
that could have caused

07:46.900 --> 07:48.500
animosity
towards your crown.

07:48.502 --> 07:51.503
None of that matters.
I'm here now.

07:51.505 --> 07:53.171
I know what Darnley did.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.006
Bothwell has coordinated
the search effort.

07:55.008 --> 07:57.175
Talk to the head of his guard.
I already have.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.110
I have my assigned region
and some thoughts

07:59.112 --> 08:01.480
on lesser known areas
he may have taken the boy.

08:01.482 --> 08:03.248
Then hurry, please.

08:08.522 --> 08:11.523
(shuddering breath)

08:20.100 --> 08:23.068
There's the road, my love.

08:23.070 --> 08:25.203
It'll be easier going from now.

08:28.609 --> 08:31.009
(baby crying)

08:33.013 --> 08:34.012
(crying continues)

08:34.014 --> 08:36.681
I...

08:36.683 --> 08:39.217
I can't think
because of the noise.

08:39.219 --> 08:40.886
KEIRA: The child
needs to rest.

08:40.888 --> 08:42.888
He can't catch a wink.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.222
(baby cries)
Lay him down,

08:44.224 --> 08:45.557
nice and soft.

08:45.559 --> 08:48.994
Give him some peace.

08:48.996 --> 08:51.096
Poor thing.

08:51.098 --> 08:53.598
Poor, poor thing.

08:53.600 --> 08:57.235
(baby crying)

09:01.608 --> 09:04.976
(crying continues)

09:09.716 --> 09:11.316
Claude, this isn't your fault.
Luc is gone, you are here,

09:11.318 --> 09:13.985
which means
he abandoned you.

09:13.987 --> 09:15.754
As I understand it, my son left

09:15.756 --> 09:19.124
whilst Claude was out
chasing her former fiancé.

09:19.126 --> 09:20.859
So, if you want
to lay the blame...

09:20.861 --> 09:22.827
Stop it! Please.

09:22.829 --> 09:23.929
It doesn't matter
who left whom.

09:23.931 --> 09:25.330
I lost both the man I loved

09:25.332 --> 09:26.865
and the man I could have loved.

09:26.867 --> 09:27.999
Oh...
HENRI:
Charles!

09:28.001 --> 09:28.934
Charles.

09:30.737 --> 09:31.703
Where are you?

09:31.705 --> 09:33.038
Oh, my God, Nicole.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.639
CATHERINE:
Henri! Wait!

09:34.641 --> 09:36.808
You can stop plotting
to attack my ship.

09:36.810 --> 09:40.946
Spain isn't coming
and you have already won.

09:40.948 --> 09:42.013
CHARLES:
Nicole.

09:42.015 --> 09:43.648
What have you done?!

09:43.650 --> 09:45.150
The woman I loved was poisoned

09:45.152 --> 09:48.353
by someone aboard the ship,
someone loyal to you.

09:48.355 --> 09:50.655
Nicole was engaged to me!
You kidnapped her!

09:51.625 --> 09:53.158
Did she try to flee?

09:53.160 --> 09:54.626
Is that why
you murdered her?

09:54.628 --> 09:55.627
No, she was poisoned.

09:55.629 --> 09:56.861
And now you're here,

09:56.863 --> 09:58.930
feigning rage,
but expecting mercy.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.066
She loved me.
She came willingly,

10:01.068 --> 10:02.901
and in your heart of hearts,
you know that.

10:03.737 --> 10:06.304
Stop! Nicole is gone.

10:06.306 --> 10:07.772
And you have every right
to be angry,

10:07.773 --> 10:09.239
but instead of
turning against one another,

10:09.242 --> 10:11.710
blame the true culprit:

10:11.712 --> 10:13.645
Spain.

10:13.647 --> 10:15.480
Spain didn't abduct my fiancée!

10:15.481 --> 10:17.314
No, but they didn't want you
to marry her, either one of you.

10:17.317 --> 10:20.652
Your own sister, Leeza, has been
working against you both,

10:20.654 --> 10:22.687
against all of us.

10:22.689 --> 10:25.290
And poor,
good-hearted Nicole here

10:25.292 --> 10:26.925
has born the brunt

10:26.927 --> 10:28.960
of Spain's treachery.

10:28.962 --> 10:33.665
It is Spain that has turned
brother against brother.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.867
They promised you the throne
and they betrayed you.

10:35.869 --> 10:37.702
Your ships didn't
come, did they?

10:37.704 --> 10:39.137
And you, my son, my king,

10:39.139 --> 10:40.739
they want you gone.

10:40.741 --> 10:41.840
There is no pleasing them.

10:41.842 --> 10:43.708
They want France for themselves.

10:43.710 --> 10:45.110
Look at her,
working her magic.

10:45.112 --> 10:46.911
Funny you should
put it like that.

10:46.913 --> 10:49.347
Was this some kind
of witchcraft?

10:49.349 --> 10:50.915
No, of course not.

10:50.917 --> 10:52.317
Would our own sister
really do this?

10:52.319 --> 10:54.786
Spain is going
after England now.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.421
Believing they've already
succeeded in tearing

10:56.423 --> 10:58.089
this house apart.

10:58.091 --> 11:01.693
You must join together,

11:01.695 --> 11:04.295
redirect your
hatred at Spain,

11:04.297 --> 11:06.197
before they swallow us whole!

11:09.036 --> 11:10.268
I'm sorry, brother.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.404
Mother's right.

11:16.910 --> 11:19.010
Has anyone seen
a stranger in town?

11:19.012 --> 11:21.046
A well-to-do looking fellow,

11:21.048 --> 11:23.915
brown hair, blue eyes,
travelling with an infant.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.183
I may know something.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.752
If you help us,
you'll be rewarded.

11:27.754 --> 11:29.821
I don't know anything about this
man they say you're looking for,

11:29.823 --> 11:31.790
but my son's an altar boy.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.958
He says a newborn lad
was left at the church

11:33.960 --> 11:35.226
first thing this morning,

11:35.228 --> 11:36.961
brought in by a farmer.

11:36.963 --> 11:39.030
Which way is the church?

11:44.237 --> 11:46.171
What is this?

11:46.173 --> 11:48.239
This is our new
marriage contract.

11:48.241 --> 11:50.942
And what makes you think
I would suddenly agree to terms

11:50.944 --> 11:53.912
that are far more advantageous
to you than our first agreement?

11:53.914 --> 11:57.115
Our circumstances have changed
since we first agreed to marry.

11:57.117 --> 11:59.718
When we drew up
the first contract,

11:59.720 --> 12:01.953
your Captain Drake had not sunk
two Spanish warships,

12:01.955 --> 12:05.323
nor was Spain on its
way to attack England.

12:05.325 --> 12:07.392
I've reached out
to the Spanish ambassador,

12:07.394 --> 12:10.061
and I can save you from a war
you cannot possibly win,

12:10.063 --> 12:12.197
but you must first agree
to the new terms.

12:14.768 --> 12:15.934
(exhales)

12:15.936 --> 12:18.770
I'll consider it.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.241
(all gasping, murmuring)

12:23.243 --> 12:24.309
Oh, my child.

12:24.311 --> 12:26.277
My child!

12:31.284 --> 12:33.351
GREER:
Is he all right?

12:33.353 --> 12:35.220
They said he was cared for.
He seems to be unharmed.

12:35.222 --> 12:38.389
He was found by a farmer who
brought him to the local parish.

12:38.391 --> 12:39.991
Reward him, James,

12:39.993 --> 12:43.094
and tell him his queen
is forever grateful.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.063
And I will never forget
what you've done for me.

12:45.065 --> 12:47.465
For my son.
I must thank you.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.300
We are all grateful.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.369
No, thank you properly.

12:51.371 --> 12:54.472
My son is home,
where he belongs.

12:54.474 --> 12:58.209
There will be a formal
naming ceremony to come,

12:58.211 --> 13:00.211
and we will call him James.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.080
In honor of my brother,

13:02.082 --> 13:04.015
a hero of Scotland.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.084
(applause, cheering)

13:10.223 --> 13:13.024
How is Prince James?

13:13.026 --> 13:16.828
MARY:
He's absolutely perfect.

13:18.431 --> 13:20.298
What is it? What's wrong?

13:20.300 --> 13:23.535
The privy council is moving
ahead with plans to appoint

13:23.537 --> 13:25.570
King Darnley the baby's steward.

13:25.572 --> 13:28.273
The King Darnley who abducted
the child; he left him to die.

13:28.275 --> 13:29.874
How can they even consider it?

13:29.876 --> 13:31.242
By turning fact to fiction.

13:31.244 --> 13:33.311
Claiming the abandonment
is propaganda.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.380
Those who would oppose me
no matter what.

13:35.382 --> 13:37.315
I said some. Not all.

13:37.317 --> 13:40.185
Rumors of Darnley's erratic
behavior circulate.

13:40.187 --> 13:43.021
Even those whose allegiances
lean toward the king

13:43.023 --> 13:45.890
must be wondering if they should
place their loyalties elsewhere.

13:45.892 --> 13:48.026
Do you think they would switch
sides and support me?

13:48.028 --> 13:50.061
I think many would blow
with the prevailing wind.

13:50.063 --> 13:54.399
Especially if King Darnley
were gone.

13:55.535 --> 13:57.902
Gone.

13:57.904 --> 14:01.472
And here we are again,
talking of murder.

14:03.877 --> 14:05.944
It is a sin I have been
unwilling to commit.

14:05.946 --> 14:08.379
But there is a very real risk

14:08.381 --> 14:11.950
that Darnley will take
my son from me-- legally.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.418
Forever.

14:13.420 --> 14:16.955
I assume you've given
this some thought.

14:16.957 --> 14:19.290
I would gather the few allies
you currently have

14:19.292 --> 14:20.992
on the privy council.

14:20.994 --> 14:23.494
King Darnley's blood would
be on all our hands,

14:23.496 --> 14:26.097
making it difficult to pin
the blame on any individual,

14:26.099 --> 14:28.032
particularly you.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.401
Your involvement must
not be known to anyone,

14:30.403 --> 14:32.503
except those you
implicitly trust.

14:32.505 --> 14:34.372
I could involve your brother.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.507
Leave James out of it.

14:36.509 --> 14:39.110
He has suffered enough
on my behalf.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.445
Most importantly,

14:40.447 --> 14:43.882
you must be kept
well away from the incident.

14:43.884 --> 14:45.650
I'll need an alibi,
a very public one.

14:45.652 --> 14:47.652
Ideally one provided by my foes.

14:49.890 --> 14:53.524
You would be risking
your life for me.

14:53.526 --> 14:57.262
I would do all that, and more,
to keep you safe.

14:57.264 --> 15:00.031
But, Mary,

15:00.033 --> 15:02.400
you must be sure.

15:02.402 --> 15:05.503
There's no turning back.

15:08.375 --> 15:11.009
No, there isn't.

15:17.250 --> 15:20.184
Kill my husband, Lord Bothwell.

15:34.401 --> 15:37.201
I thought I would
find you here.

15:37.203 --> 15:38.369
Mother.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.238
You always loved
those summers

15:40.240 --> 15:42.340
you spent here
with your cousins.

15:43.376 --> 15:44.609
Is, uh, Kiera here as well?

15:44.611 --> 15:47.178
Yes. Oh, she's right...

15:47.180 --> 15:48.546
here...

15:51.451 --> 15:53.117
I don't always see her.

15:53.119 --> 15:55.520
But when I do,
she's as real to me

15:55.522 --> 15:56.988
as you are.

15:56.990 --> 15:58.957
I'm not well, am I, Mother?

15:58.959 --> 16:01.392
You've been under a strain,
and that is all the more reason

16:01.394 --> 16:03.127
that you should stay here.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.096
At least until the
privy council names you

16:05.098 --> 16:06.698
Steward of the Heir.

16:06.700 --> 16:08.299
My son, you mean.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.168
My God, I think
I left him somewhere.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.704
No, the prince was
found. He is well.

16:12.706 --> 16:14.038
I can't do this, Mother.
I can't...

16:14.040 --> 16:15.206
I can't take care of him. I-I...

16:15.208 --> 16:16.641
All parents make mistakes.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.343
No, no, this is different.
Yes, it is.

16:18.345 --> 16:19.711
Because if he is your charge,

16:19.713 --> 16:23.181
you control the next
king of Scotland.

16:23.183 --> 16:25.350
You are keeping
the monarchy stable,

16:25.352 --> 16:28.086
and that brings
you respect,

16:28.088 --> 16:31.990
privilege, alliances
that will keep you alive.

16:33.126 --> 16:35.493
Now, when did you last eat?

16:35.495 --> 16:39.097
A few days ago, I think.

16:39.099 --> 16:40.765
The staff hasn't been here in
months and you need provisions.

16:40.767 --> 16:43.334
I will return first
thing in the morning.

16:43.336 --> 16:46.371
But remember,
you must stay hidden.

16:46.373 --> 16:48.139
Do you understand?

17:06.092 --> 17:07.759
ELIZABETH:
French jewelry, French designs,

17:07.761 --> 17:10.294
French fabric,
all found at your home,

17:10.296 --> 17:14.332
given to you
by that French viper Narcisse,

17:14.334 --> 17:16.200
as payment
for killing

17:16.202 --> 17:18.136
Lord Blackburn, admit it.

17:18.138 --> 17:19.737
I'll hang anyway, won't I?

17:19.739 --> 17:21.639
But that's not good
enough for you.

17:21.641 --> 17:23.541
You want to hear it,
you want it to your liking,

17:23.543 --> 17:25.176
and nothing
else will do.

17:25.178 --> 17:26.744
You royals.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.146
You hate us.

17:28.148 --> 17:30.248
My grandfather worked
for Henry VIII,

17:30.250 --> 17:33.451
and when he didn't polish your
father's ring to his liking,

17:33.453 --> 17:36.220
the king sawed off his finger
with a butter knife.

17:36.222 --> 17:38.322
He was sent home,
the wound stank,

17:38.324 --> 17:40.258
his veins turned black,

17:40.260 --> 17:44.128
and he screamed in pain
for two full days until he died.

17:44.130 --> 17:45.596
I never hurt you.

17:45.598 --> 17:48.399
Gideon Blackburn
never hurt you.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.767
He didn't deserve to die.

17:51.271 --> 17:52.470
I'm sorry
you were born a servant...

17:52.472 --> 17:54.238
No, you're not.
You like having servants.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.374
They dress you, feed you,

17:56.376 --> 17:59.477
know your every need. But
what do you know of us?

17:59.479 --> 18:02.547
Of the undeserving losses
we suffer all the time?

18:02.549 --> 18:03.748
We suffer...

18:05.118 --> 18:08.519
I do not require
a lesson in suffering

18:08.521 --> 18:10.254
from the likes of you.

18:15.728 --> 18:20.131
So, the girl
your sons loved is dead.

18:20.133 --> 18:22.700
They must both be sad.

18:22.702 --> 18:24.869
(both chuckle)

18:24.871 --> 18:26.737
Sad, but bonded in their grief.

18:26.739 --> 18:29.740
And the moon is full,
and I've brought...

18:29.742 --> 18:32.443
Lord Narcisse, as...

18:32.445 --> 18:33.845
uh, requested.

18:33.847 --> 18:36.214
NARCISSE: Well,
as much as we've enjoyed

18:36.216 --> 18:37.582
chatting and drinking wine,

18:37.584 --> 18:38.816
is there, uh...?

18:38.818 --> 18:40.818
Shouldn't...?

18:40.820 --> 18:42.453
Why don't you, um...

18:42.455 --> 18:45.690
tell us what you need
to fulfill the debt.

18:45.692 --> 18:48.759
Or, um, um, land, and, uh...

18:48.761 --> 18:50.428
(both laugh)
What is it?

18:51.764 --> 18:53.764
Is it gold?

18:53.766 --> 18:56.767
It's not a thing that I desire.

18:56.769 --> 19:00.638
But rather, an experience.

19:04.544 --> 19:07.778
You're both so powerful.

19:09.582 --> 19:13.784
Together, we can truly change
the world...

And I thought the backstabbing
generally began

21:00.293 --> 21:01.525
after the wedding vows.

21:01.527 --> 21:03.694
I'm hoping

21:03.696 --> 21:06.564
the idea I might marry a
Catholic will give Spain pause,

21:06.566 --> 21:09.600
and buy you enough time to
ready the Royal English Navy

21:09.602 --> 21:11.369
for war.

21:11.371 --> 21:13.571
I'm assuming we'll need
more than pithy retorts

21:13.573 --> 21:14.772
to defeat the Spanish Armada,

21:14.774 --> 21:16.807
which is
coming for us.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.743
A lot more, I'm afraid.

21:18.745 --> 21:19.810
Even with the infusion of gold

21:19.812 --> 21:21.879
we stole from
your fiancé's family,

21:21.881 --> 21:24.015
there's only so many ships
we can outfit for war

21:24.017 --> 21:25.416
in such a short time.

21:25.418 --> 21:26.917
But that's not
our greatest worry.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.921
Even if we defeat
the Armada,

21:30.923 --> 21:32.957
the victory
will be a costly one.

21:32.959 --> 21:35.993
It will deplete England's
military at every level.

21:35.995 --> 21:38.929
Uh, gunpowder, steel,
soldiers.

21:38.931 --> 21:41.365
Which leaves us vulnerable
to a ground invasion

21:41.367 --> 21:42.833
from the North.

21:42.835 --> 21:45.970
Scottish forces could make easy
work of our weakened defenses.

21:45.972 --> 21:47.872
Which Spain will allow.

21:47.874 --> 21:51.542
Happy to have her on my throne,
as she is a Catholic.

21:51.544 --> 21:53.444
As always,

21:53.446 --> 21:59.383
the specter of Mary Stuart
hovers over me like an axe.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.086
Shh.

22:05.591 --> 22:06.957
(sighs)

22:06.959 --> 22:08.459
I know that look.

22:08.461 --> 22:10.728
You're afraid.

22:10.730 --> 22:12.630
Yes, I am.

22:12.632 --> 22:14.498
But the baby is safe.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.033
He'll never be safe.

22:16.035 --> 22:17.968
Not until...

22:17.970 --> 22:21.472
You are doing what you must,
for your son and for Scotland.

22:21.474 --> 22:23.441
Not just for Scotland.

22:23.443 --> 22:27.745
I'm reminded of the prophecy
Bash sent, through David Rizzio.

22:27.747 --> 22:30.781
That your heir would unite both
Scotland and England in peace.

22:30.783 --> 22:33.884
MARY: I don't know
if any of it's true.

22:33.886 --> 22:36.454
But I do know that my son means
more to me than my own life.

22:36.456 --> 22:38.489
I don't regret what
I've done tonight.

22:38.491 --> 22:40.358
I would do it again,

22:40.360 --> 22:42.927
without a moment's hesitation
to protect my child.

22:44.130 --> 22:45.563
Only...

22:48.501 --> 22:52.536
...what am I going to tell him
about his father?

22:52.538 --> 22:55.072
Are you sure
King Darnley's inside?

22:55.074 --> 22:57.475
The queen
had Lady Lennox followed.

22:57.477 --> 22:59.877
Darnley's inside and alone.

22:59.879 --> 23:03.013
The explosion should kill the
king and set the house on fire,

23:03.015 --> 23:06.150
destroying any trace
of foul play.

23:06.152 --> 23:08.018
Hopefully, then,

23:08.020 --> 23:10.621
<i> it will all appear</i>
<i> to be a most tragic accident.</i>

23:10.623 --> 23:12.823
<i> It's vital Queen Mary</i>
<i> not be implicated.</i>

23:12.825 --> 23:15.025
<i> Which is why,</i>
<i> at this very moment,</i>

23:15.027 --> 23:16.761
<i> she's hosting a reception</i>
<i> for the new privy council,</i>

23:16.763 --> 23:18.696
<i> cajoling them as well,</i>

23:18.698 --> 23:21.165
<i>so that, when they receive news</i>
<i> of the king's death,</i>

23:21.167 --> 23:23.467
<i> they might fall to our side.</i>

23:34.580 --> 23:37.515
It's time.
Head back to court.

23:37.517 --> 23:40.017
Make sure you're seen so
you can vouch for the two of us.

23:47.994 --> 23:50.861
(dog barking)

24:02.675 --> 24:05.843
Something's wrong. The charges
should have ignited by now.

24:05.845 --> 24:07.745
Wait here.

24:23.696 --> 24:26.130
(grunting)

24:33.673 --> 24:34.805
(coughing)

24:43.816 --> 24:46.217
Clarkson!

24:46.219 --> 24:47.952
Oh, you'll hang for this!

24:49.121 --> 24:50.688
(shouting)

25:07.640 --> 25:10.708
(choking)

25:33.966 --> 25:36.200
(panting)

25:36.202 --> 25:38.269
(grunts)

25:52.952 --> 25:56.053
There's a letter from
Queen Mary, Your Majesty.

26:01.594 --> 26:04.562
(door closes)

26:04.564 --> 26:06.564
MARY:
<i> Dear Elizabeth.</i>

26:06.566 --> 26:10.100
<i> My duty is to my heir,</i>
<i> and to Scotland,</i>

26:10.102 --> 26:13.270
<i> both of which I fear</i>
<i> could be lost.</i>

26:13.272 --> 26:16.740
<i> So, from one lonely queen</i>
<i> to another,</i>

26:16.742 --> 26:20.244
<i> I ask that should anything</i>
<i> happen to me,</i>

26:20.246 --> 26:23.280
<i> you will protect my child</i>
<i> as your own.</i>

26:23.282 --> 26:25.649
<i> In turn, I promise you</i>

26:25.651 --> 26:29.687
<i> that your throne shall never</i>
<i> be threatened by me.</i>

26:33.626 --> 26:36.126
Ah, there you are, Elizabeth.

26:36.128 --> 26:37.828
You should have your staff
collect your things.

26:37.830 --> 26:39.263
And search
for a bride elsewhere.

26:39.265 --> 26:40.831
What are you saying?

26:40.833 --> 26:42.833
That our marriage is no longer

26:42.835 --> 26:44.935
of strategic importance
to England,

26:44.937 --> 26:47.037
and as such, it will not happen.

26:47.039 --> 26:48.672
I received a
letter today

26:48.674 --> 26:50.274
from my cousin Mary,

26:50.276 --> 26:53.677
in which she renounced
her designs on my throne.

26:53.679 --> 26:55.946
Scotland is no longer
a threat to my reign.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.114
Mary.

26:57.116 --> 26:58.716
How can you trust her?

26:58.718 --> 27:01.018
Because she is besieged
on all sides

27:01.020 --> 27:04.121
by a world of men
who seek to tear her down

27:04.123 --> 27:07.091
because they cannot control her.

27:07.093 --> 27:08.993
Somehow I understand
her predicament.

27:08.995 --> 27:10.160
But Spain.

27:10.162 --> 27:12.730
I am trying to save you.
You are...

27:12.732 --> 27:14.264
I am England.

27:14.266 --> 27:16.266
And I need no one to save me.

27:16.268 --> 27:18.168
Not from Spain,

27:18.170 --> 27:21.839
not from the Catholic Church,
not from anyone.

27:21.841 --> 27:26.377
I am Elizabeth Tudor,
and I will bow to no man.

27:26.379 --> 27:30.914
I will face every threat
to my reign with sword in hand.

27:30.916 --> 27:35.152
And any who stand
in my way shall fall.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.221
(flute music playing)

27:51.437 --> 27:53.137
To the destruction of Spain.

27:53.139 --> 27:55.305
Justice for Nicole.

27:55.307 --> 27:57.374
ALL:
Here, here.

27:58.744 --> 28:00.811
(voices echoing)

28:04.350 --> 28:06.417
(laughter echoing)

28:08.421 --> 28:11.055
Are you sure
your plan will work?
HENRI: I am.

28:11.057 --> 28:13.190
The Basques are Spain's
greatest internal threat.

28:13.192 --> 28:15.392
If we supply their rebels
with enough weapons,

28:15.394 --> 28:17.127
They'll rain disaster
upon Philip,

28:17.129 --> 28:19.930
while his troops
are away in England.
(scoffs)

28:19.932 --> 28:21.031
Don't be fools.

28:22.068 --> 28:24.334
The Basques hate the French

28:24.336 --> 28:26.003
even more
than they hate the Spanish.

28:26.005 --> 28:28.172
They will betray you,
Charles. (grunts)

28:29.275 --> 28:30.908
Then Spain will march

28:30.910 --> 28:32.376
on Paris in revenge.

28:32.378 --> 28:34.078
I think you've had one too many.

28:34.080 --> 28:35.813
Charles, please. Listen to me...

28:35.815 --> 28:36.780
You should go rest, Mother.

28:36.782 --> 28:38.282
Come on.

28:43.222 --> 28:45.222
The old girl's not
what she used to be.

28:45.224 --> 28:48.058
I think of all the trouble.

28:48.060 --> 28:50.494
It was actually mother's doubt
in me that set things in motion.

28:50.496 --> 28:53.430
How should we supply
the rebels?

28:53.432 --> 28:55.365
If we go down the coast...

28:55.367 --> 28:57.935
(indistinct chatter)

29:13.085 --> 29:15.486
(Catherine panting)

29:15.488 --> 29:18.222
Are you real?

29:18.224 --> 29:20.124
Whatever you've given me...
(exhales)

29:20.126 --> 29:21.492
keeps hitting me in waves.

29:21.494 --> 29:22.926
I'm real.

29:22.928 --> 29:24.528
Why didn't you die?

29:24.530 --> 29:25.863
He protects us.

29:25.865 --> 29:27.198
Us? You're not...

29:27.199 --> 29:28.532
Oh, but I am.
You wonder what your children

29:28.534 --> 29:30.400
are going to achieve,
don't you?

29:30.402 --> 29:32.269
I can tell you
what your sons will do.

29:32.271 --> 29:33.871
Their plot
against Spain

29:33.873 --> 29:35.539
will backfire.
I'll stop it.

29:35.541 --> 29:38.108
They're puppies, they're just
chasing their own tails.

29:38.110 --> 29:41.078
You could stop it,
but there will be a price.

29:41.080 --> 29:42.813
Are you saying
that I have a choice?

29:42.815 --> 29:44.148
Tell me what it is.

29:44.150 --> 29:45.816
If you interfere
with their plan,

29:45.818 --> 29:47.284
a plan that is destined to fail,

29:47.286 --> 29:49.286
they will make you
their scapegoat.

29:49.288 --> 29:51.121
Your name vilified for all time,

29:51.123 --> 29:53.991
your body hanging from a rope
before the next waning moon.

29:53.993 --> 29:55.993
And if I don't stop it?

29:55.995 --> 29:57.294
They will face ruin.

29:57.296 --> 30:00.164
Charles's rule will not last.

30:00.166 --> 30:05.302
You're asking me to sacrifice
my sons for myself.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.437
No, I've always put
my children first.

30:07.439 --> 30:10.174
I have done terrible things.

30:10.176 --> 30:12.910
I've always done it
for their good.

30:12.912 --> 30:14.311
But are they
worth it?

30:14.313 --> 30:15.512
Francis was.

30:15.514 --> 30:18.549
A noble, decent man
and a good king.

30:18.551 --> 30:20.284
Your other sons,
Charles and Henri,

30:20.286 --> 30:23.187
are but pale shadows
of your golden child,

30:23.189 --> 30:25.589
the dark side of a moon
that once shone so bright.

30:25.591 --> 30:28.592
And if I don't want to die
for their sins?

30:28.594 --> 30:31.028
The key to your survival,
should you choose it,

30:31.030 --> 30:33.897
is your daughter, Margot.

30:33.899 --> 30:36.166
Blood will flow,
but it won't be yours,

30:36.168 --> 30:38.602
if you have Margot
at your side.

30:43.209 --> 30:45.309
(laughs)

30:45.311 --> 30:46.543
Is it real?

30:46.545 --> 30:48.011
Princess Margot.

30:51.951 --> 30:53.350
Mother.

30:53.352 --> 30:55.352
It's been so long.
I know, darling.

30:55.354 --> 30:58.088
And it's time to come home.

30:58.090 --> 31:00.557
Mother needs you at her side.

31:14.173 --> 31:17.107
I am one among you.

31:17.109 --> 31:21.879
And I will lay down my life
for God and kingdom.

31:21.881 --> 31:25.883
I may have the body of a woman,

31:25.885 --> 31:28.652
but I have the heart of a king.

31:28.654 --> 31:34.458
I will take up arms with you
as your general and your judge,

31:34.460 --> 31:38.528
and I will reward your every
virtue on the field.

31:40.666 --> 31:45.135
We will live or we will die...

31:45.137 --> 31:48.205
but we will not live in fear!

31:48.207 --> 31:50.607
(all shouting)

31:59.418 --> 32:00.951
Bothwell, where have you been?
We've been waiting for you

32:00.953 --> 32:03.320
all night.
Is Darnley still alive?

32:03.322 --> 32:05.689
No. He's dead.

32:05.691 --> 32:08.959
I'm afraid our
original plan went awry.

32:08.961 --> 32:10.394
King Darnley survived
the explosion.

32:10.396 --> 32:12.930
I, uh...

32:12.932 --> 32:14.531
I had to take his life
with my own hands.

32:14.533 --> 32:17.200
I have a bad feeling about this.
I think we ought to flee.

32:17.202 --> 32:18.669
Flee? Nothing would make you

32:18.671 --> 32:20.003
both look guiltier.

32:20.005 --> 32:20.971
We need to raise troops.

32:20.973 --> 32:22.439
If there are
charges of murder,

32:22.441 --> 32:23.974
we're gonna need a force of men.

32:23.976 --> 32:25.609
Lord Bothwell.

32:25.611 --> 32:28.078
You're under arrest for
the murder of King Darnley.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.480
You will be tried

32:29.481 --> 32:30.881
for the traitorous
and unconscionable act

32:30.882 --> 32:32.282
of regicide.
What are you talking about?

32:32.284 --> 32:34.184
Your husband has been murdered
at that man's hand.

32:34.186 --> 32:35.452
Guard him already.

32:35.454 --> 32:37.220
MARY:
I am ordering you.

32:37.222 --> 32:38.155
If one of you
lays a hand on him,

32:38.157 --> 32:39.456
he will pay with his life.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.191
As for you, Reverend Knox,

32:41.193 --> 32:44.027
may I remind you,
I am your queen.

32:44.029 --> 32:45.429
Not for long.

32:45.431 --> 32:47.664
There were witnesses
to my king's murder.

32:47.666 --> 32:49.333
Tell our sovereign
what you told me.

32:49.335 --> 32:51.969
It was Bothwell.
He threatened us-- said if

32:51.971 --> 32:53.670
we didn't help him murder the
king, he would have us arrested.

32:53.672 --> 32:56.106
You thought Darnley was alive.
You went to Knox hoping

32:56.108 --> 32:58.008
he'd save you
from our king's wrath.

32:58.010 --> 33:00.510
And you dragged Lord Margate
into it, didn't you?!

33:00.512 --> 33:01.545
Careful, Bothwell.

33:01.547 --> 33:03.513
You might implicate yourself,

33:03.515 --> 33:05.749
and then what fun
would your trial be?

33:05.751 --> 33:07.617
As if you'd let me stand trial!

33:07.619 --> 33:08.552
Arrest him!

33:09.621 --> 33:11.254
Arrest her, too.
The witnesses say

33:11.256 --> 33:13.256
she was privy
to every detail.

33:17.496 --> 33:19.062
Take him.

33:20.632 --> 33:21.665
Tell him I love him.

33:21.667 --> 33:23.367
Raise him as if
he were your own.

33:23.369 --> 33:24.668
I will. I swear it.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.103
I am your queen.

33:26.105 --> 33:28.105
You have no proof.
You will never win this!

33:28.107 --> 33:29.506
This is a mistake
you'll never recover from.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.108
It will be your undoing.

33:31.110 --> 33:32.609
(shrieks)

33:32.611 --> 33:34.244
The only crime I have committed

33:34.246 --> 33:36.513
that you care about is
that I am a woman.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.248
A woman who wears a crown.

33:38.250 --> 33:41.151
A woman in power goes
against nature itself.

33:41.153 --> 33:42.486
Men will never willingly

33:42.488 --> 33:44.621
bow to the weaker sex.

33:44.623 --> 33:47.357
And they will suffer greatly
for it.

33:57.102 --> 33:59.102
(bell tolls)

34:01.673 --> 34:03.774
(bell tolls)

34:03.776 --> 34:07.511
MARY:
<i>It was the start of my undoing.</i>

34:07.513 --> 34:10.247
(bell tolls)

34:12.618 --> 34:14.484
(bell tolls)

34:16.722 --> 34:19.389
The only thing I regret

34:19.391 --> 34:23.160
is that it's been so long
since I've seen his face.

34:23.162 --> 34:25.395
Did you get word
to him?

34:25.397 --> 34:29.666
I believe that he is
my only chance of survival.

34:29.668 --> 34:31.735
We still await his answer.

34:43.315 --> 34:47.150
You cannot allow the execution
of a fellow queen.

34:47.152 --> 34:49.619
Elizabeth, she is my mother.

34:49.621 --> 34:52.856
A mother you have not seen
since you were an infant.

34:52.858 --> 34:54.524
And whose doing
was that?

34:54.526 --> 34:57.160
How much pressure from you
did my uncle endure?

34:57.162 --> 35:01.298
You are an adult now,
and the king of Scotland.

35:01.300 --> 35:04.301
Surely you can make
your own choices.

35:04.303 --> 35:06.403
Why have you not gone to her?

35:06.405 --> 35:08.105
For the same reason
you have avoided

35:08.107 --> 35:10.607
meeting her your entire life.

35:10.609 --> 35:13.110
Because we both have
what is rightfully hers.

35:13.112 --> 35:15.345
My crown and yours.

35:15.347 --> 35:17.247
It is she who should be
uniting our nations.

35:17.249 --> 35:18.615
James.

35:18.617 --> 35:20.650
She can't.

35:20.652 --> 35:24.721
Her choices have ruined her.

35:24.723 --> 35:27.657
I often wonder,
what choice did she have?

35:27.659 --> 35:30.127
They say my father was mad.

35:30.129 --> 35:32.496
She must have been desperate.

35:32.498 --> 35:34.464
Desperate enough
to come to you for help.

35:34.466 --> 35:36.133
And what did you do?

35:36.135 --> 35:37.534
Held her prisoner
for two decades

35:37.536 --> 35:39.202
after promising to protect her!

35:39.204 --> 35:41.638
When I made the
offer, I did not know

35:41.640 --> 35:43.607
she would be fleeing
a murder charge.

35:43.609 --> 35:46.776
I did not know she would
continue to conspire against me.

35:46.778 --> 35:49.346
Men have conspired against you
using her as a weapon.

35:49.348 --> 35:51.548
These letters
you finally have as evidence--

35:51.550 --> 35:54.784
evidence enough to execute her--
could be forged.

35:54.786 --> 35:57.387
Then petition me to stop it.

35:57.389 --> 36:00.490
But the real forgery is you...

36:00.492 --> 36:02.292
pretending to be brave.

36:02.294 --> 36:07.631
Elizabeth, the Warrior Queen,
who ushered in the golden age,

36:07.633 --> 36:10.901
when really all the while,
you've been living in fear.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.572
Must be exhausting.

36:15.574 --> 36:17.707
It is.

36:17.709 --> 36:19.643
Is that why

36:19.645 --> 36:22.746
you need the final choice
to be mine?

36:22.748 --> 36:25.715
Because you know
you are giving into weariness?

36:25.717 --> 36:28.185
Or is it

36:28.187 --> 36:30.420
because you know it's wrong?

36:32.224 --> 36:34.591
I ask you

36:34.593 --> 36:37.928
one last time.

36:39.631 --> 36:42.199
Do you want to be named my heir,

36:42.201 --> 36:45.735
James, the first of
your name to rule

36:45.737 --> 36:49.539
England and Scotland,
united at last?

36:49.541 --> 36:53.376
Ending the bloodshed
between our two countries,

36:53.378 --> 36:56.213
and fulfilling
your mother's dream?

36:56.215 --> 36:57.881
Or...

36:57.883 --> 37:00.617
you could save her...

37:00.619 --> 37:05.922
but she will rot
for decades more in captivity,

37:05.924 --> 37:09.226
because I cannot have
her blood on my hands.

37:11.663 --> 37:14.231
And I cannot let her go.

37:44.863 --> 37:46.796
Has my son replied?

37:46.798 --> 37:48.632
We've received word
from King James himself.

37:48.634 --> 37:52.369
He's not coming,
and there will be no reprieve.

38:26.838 --> 38:30.040
(sighs)

38:34.846 --> 38:38.348
I put my trust in you, my Lord.

38:50.462 --> 38:54.831
FRANCIS:
<i> Mary? Mary?</i>

38:59.504 --> 39:01.004
Francis.

39:01.006 --> 39:04.074
I've been waiting for you.

39:05.510 --> 39:08.078
Is this real?

39:08.080 --> 39:11.414
Nothing is more real.

39:12.884 --> 39:15.485
I love you.

39:15.487 --> 39:17.087
I always have.

39:17.089 --> 39:19.055
I love you, too.

39:19.057 --> 39:22.726
Were we truly
this young?

39:22.728 --> 39:25.428
Yes.

39:25.430 --> 39:28.098
It seems like so long ago.

39:30.435 --> 39:33.937
It's been so difficult, Francis.

39:33.939 --> 39:35.505
So difficult.

39:35.507 --> 39:37.040
Shh.
