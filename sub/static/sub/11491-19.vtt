00:03.800 --> 00:06.936
* Larry was just a single dad *

00:06.937 --> 00:10.740
* Till a toxic spill
in the science lab *

00:10.741 --> 00:15.644
* Gave him super strength
and X-ray es *

00:15.645 --> 00:20.416
* He cooks, he cleans,
and now he flies *

00:20.417 --> 00:23.285
* Superdad *

00:23.286 --> 00:27.390
* He's a Superdad *

00:27.391 --> 00:29.825
* He's a whiz
in the kitchen *

00:29.826 --> 00:32.895
* Makes potatoes au gratin... *

00:35.632 --> 00:40.636
* While helping the government
find Osama Bin Laden. *

00:43.640 --> 00:44.673
Oh, hey.

00:44.674 --> 00:45.841
What's that?

00:45.842 --> 00:47.043
I'm writing a theme song

00:47.044 --> 00:48.644
for a new sitcom
on Nickelodeon.

00:48.645 --> 00:51.814
Does the show suck
as much as the song?

00:55.118 --> 00:56.152
Who the hell are you?

00:56.153 --> 00:57.453
Oh, this is my
friend, Eldridge.

00:57.454 --> 00:58.487
He plays drums.

00:58.488 --> 00:59.655
Okay.

00:59.656 --> 01:01.290
That explains the bad attitude.

01:01.291 --> 01:02.691
What, you're ragging
on my name?

01:02.692 --> 01:04.626
No, I'm ragging
on your instrument.

01:05.695 --> 01:07.263
Now, beat it. I'busy.

01:07.264 --> 01:09.065
He said "beat it."

01:09.066 --> 01:11.500
And "instrument."

01:15.472 --> 01:18.641
* Fighting crime,
packing lunches *

01:18.642 --> 01:23.512
* Changing diapers
and throwing punches... *

01:24.681 --> 01:26.348
Little turd was right.

01:26.349 --> 01:28.350
This does suck.

01:28.351 --> 01:31.420
Hey.

01:31.421 --> 01:32.788
Jake's friend show up?

01:32.789 --> 01:34.090
Yeah, he's here.

01:34.091 --> 01:35.758
When's he leaving?

01:35.759 --> 01:37.326
I said he could spend the night.

01:37.327 --> 01:39.628
Really? Did you consider
clearing it with me?

01:39.629 --> 01:42.031
You would have said no
to Jake having a friend over?

01:42.032 --> 01:45.801
If you recall, seven years ago,
I said no to having Jake over.

01:45.802 --> 01:49.338
And yet, here he is,
so what's the point in asking?

01:49.339 --> 01:51.373
Fine.

01:51.374 --> 01:53.509
What do we know
about the little drummer boy?

01:53.510 --> 01:56.645
Not much. Jakes says he's one
of the cool kids at school.

01:56.646 --> 01:58.647
Then, why is he
hanging out with Jake?

01:58.648 --> 02:00.883
Are you saying
my son's not cool?

02:00.884 --> 02:02.618
I'm saying your son
got his tongue stuck

02:02.619 --> 02:03.986
to the freezer last weekend.

02:03.987 --> 02:05.821
That could have happened
to anybody.

02:05.822 --> 02:08.924
Anybody who tried to pick up
an Eskimo Pie with their tongue.

02:08.925 --> 02:10.960
His hands were full.

02:10.961 --> 02:13.596
With a HoneyBaked Ham.

02:13.597 --> 02:15.664
Okay, so he's not cool.

02:15.665 --> 02:17.366
And he eats a lot of crap.

02:17.367 --> 02:18.767
And his grades aren't the best.

02:18.768 --> 02:21.570
And his personal hygiene
is a little sketchy.

02:21.571 --> 02:24.273
Is there a "but" coming?

02:24.274 --> 02:27.343
But he's my son,

02:27.344 --> 02:30.379
and I love him.

02:32.249 --> 02:33.382
What's so funny?

02:33.383 --> 02:36.619
Mom says the same thingabou.

02:36.620 --> 02:39.622
Really? Mom says she loves me?

03:39.426 --> 03:41.127
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

03:41.128 --> 03:42.262
hey, hey!

03:42.263 --> 03:43.796
Hey.

03:44.632 --> 03:46.866
I'm trying to work out there.

03:46.867 --> 03:49.769
Well, what do you think
we're doing in here, man?

03:49.770 --> 03:52.372
Don't feed me straight lines,
Alfalfa.

03:53.374 --> 03:55.275
Just keep it down.

03:58.579 --> 04:00.013
Alfalfa?

04:00.014 --> 04:01.347
He gives everyone nicknames.

04:01.348 --> 04:02.415
I'm Pumpkin Head.

04:02.416 --> 04:04.184
My dad's the Sponge.

04:04.185 --> 04:07.120
Don't even ask
what he calls my grandma.

04:07.121 --> 04:09.689
It rhymes with "bitch."

04:09.690 --> 04:12.025
Oh, wait, it is Bitch.

04:13.761 --> 04:15.795
Rhymes with, uh...

04:15.796 --> 04:16.930
Ditch?

04:16.930 --> 04:18.298
No.

04:18.298 --> 04:19.298
Snitch?

04:19.300 --> 04:20.899
No.

04:20.901 --> 04:24.437
Itch?
No.

04:25.272 --> 04:27.240
Man, this is boring.

04:27.241 --> 04:29.242
Hold o I'll think of it.

04:29.243 --> 04:31.311
No, I mean, what are we going
to do tonight?

04:31.312 --> 04:33.279
I don't know.
What do you want to do?

04:33.280 --> 04:34.847
I don't know.

04:34.848 --> 04:36.249
Well, I don't know, either.

04:37.551 --> 04:38.785
Hey.

04:38.786 --> 04:40.720
Why don't we steal some beer
from your fridge,

04:40.721 --> 04:42.455
go down to the beach
and get wasted.

04:42.456 --> 04:44.691
Okay, but I got to warn you,

04:44.692 --> 04:47.060
I get kind of stupid
when I drink.

04:47.061 --> 04:49.562
Don't worry.ou can leave
the thinking to me.

04:51.699 --> 04:53.032
Hey, you know what?

04:53.033 --> 04:56.202
It does rhyme with "ditch."

04:56.203 --> 04:58.438
What does?

05:00.040 --> 05:02.275
* Men. *

05:02.276 --> 05:04.877
Daddy, is Mr. Boots dead?

05:04.878 --> 05:07.680
Well, Jay Bob, you did
throw him out of a moving car.

05:07.681 --> 05:09.549
That's never good
for a housecat.

05:10.951 --> 05:13.419
I thought they were
supposed to land on their feet.

05:13.420 --> 05:15.355
And that's what
he was trying to do

05:15.356 --> 05:17.056
when he bounced off
the FedEx truck.

05:17.057 --> 05:18.958
But let me see what I can do.

05:18.959 --> 05:21.461
Cover your eyes.
Okay.

05:27.434 --> 05:30.403
Mr. Boots, you're okay!

05:30.404 --> 05:33.273
Just remember, he's
ly got five lives left.

05:37.111 --> 05:39.846
Maybe my song
doesn't suck enough.

05:39.847 --> 05:40.847
Hey.

05:40.848 --> 05:42.382
So, where's Jake and Eldridge?

05:42.383 --> 05:43.449
Beats me.

05:43.450 --> 05:45.184
Last I saw them,
they were stealing beer

05:45.185 --> 05:47.387
out of the fridge
and sneaking out the back.

05:47.388 --> 05:49.255
They stole beer?

05:49.256 --> 05:51.858
They had to.
I locked up the hard stuff.

05:51.859 --> 05:53.593
Charlie!

05:53.594 --> 05:56.162
Relax. How drunk can they get
off a 12-pack?

05:57.398 --> 05:58.765
Damn it.

05:58.766 --> 06:00.099
This had to be Eldridge's idea.

06:00.100 --> 06:02.068
Jake would never think of it
on his own.

06:02.069 --> 06:03.336
That's true.

06:03.337 --> 06:04.470
Last bright idea he had

06:04.471 --> 06:07.507
was to pick up an Eskimo Pie
with his tongue.

06:07.508 --> 06:09.375
I better go look for them.

06:09.376 --> 06:11.311
Good idea.

06:11.312 --> 06:13.212
Embarrass him in front
of his only guy friend.

06:13.213 --> 06:15.248
Eldridgeisn't his o.

06:15.249 --> 06:17.150
Who else does he hang out with?

06:17.151 --> 06:20.653
And you can't count you, me,
orilitary recruiters.

06:20.654 --> 06:22.388
So, what, I'm supposed
to do nothing?

06:22.389 --> 06:23.656
They have to be punished.

06:23.657 --> 06:26.959
Don't worry. The alcohol
will punish them plenty.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.661
Yeah, that's really worked
for you.

06:28.662 --> 06:32.732
Trust me, Alan:
Inside, I'm suffering.

06:36.303 --> 06:38.571
Oh, the agony.

06:41.942 --> 06:44.010
* Men. *

06:47.047 --> 06:49.882
Beer's not so cool now, is it?

06:49.883 --> 06:51.617
Leave me alone.

06:52.453 --> 06:53.619
And you...

06:53.620 --> 06:55.455
what is your mother
going to say?

06:57.891 --> 07:00.393
For God's sake, that's wicker!

07:00.394 --> 07:02.128
Hey.

07:02.129 --> 07:04.097
How are we all doing in here?

07:07.935 --> 07:11.037
You should have stopped them
when you had the chance.

07:11.038 --> 07:12.705
And miss out on this?

07:12.706 --> 07:14.407
How's it hanging, Alfalfa?

07:17.111 --> 07:19.712
And you call yourself a drummer.

07:19.713 --> 07:23.349
Keith Moon is vomiting
in his grave.

07:24.351 --> 07:26.753
* Men. *

07:40.300 --> 07:42.168
That's really beautiful,
Charlie.

07:42.169 --> 07:43.836
Thanks.

07:43.837 --> 07:46.139
I wrote it before
I got kicked out of Juilliard.

07:48.442 --> 07:50.443
How'd you go from writing
something like that

07:50.444 --> 07:52.278
to jingles and kid music?

07:52.279 --> 07:54.580
Well, after I left school,

07:54.581 --> 07:57.417
I came back to L.A.
Hoping to write film sres.

07:57.418 --> 07:59.252
But I met this advertising guy

07:59.253 --> 08:01.421
who needed a song
about toothpaste.

08:01.422 --> 08:03.322
Before I knew it, I was rhyming

08:03.323 --> 08:06.492
"exhilaration"
with "constipation."

08:06.493 --> 08:09.328
"Open doors" with "cold sores."

08:09.329 --> 08:12.064
And one I am particularly
proud of,

08:12.065 --> 08:15.134
"make a switch"
with "feminine itch."

08:15.135 --> 08:16.869
I hear you.

08:16.870 --> 08:19.305
When I came out here,
I was hoping to be a dancer.

08:19.306 --> 08:22.208
Really?

08:22.209 --> 08:23.342
Yeah.

08:23.343 --> 08:25.178
Then I met pot and doughnuts.

08:25.179 --> 08:27.547
Before I knew it,
I was scrubbing toilets

08:27.548 --> 08:30.683
and hosing teenage bf
out of wicker baskets.

08:31.552 --> 08:34.086
Rhyme that, Beethoven.

08:37.591 --> 08:40.126
* A tisket, a tasket *

08:40.126 --> 08:42.727
* I'm barfing in a basket. *

08:43.897 --> 08:46.365
That's what pays
your salary, baby.

08:47.935 --> 08:49.101
All ght, this
is Eldridge's mom.

08:49.102 --> 08:50.770
I'm going to give her
a piece of my mind.

08:50.771 --> 08:52.371
Oh, just let it go.

08:52.372 --> 08:54.507
No, no. This is poor parenting
on her part,

08:54.508 --> 08:56.342
and she needs to know about it.

08:56.343 --> 08:58.177
Hi. I'm here
to pick up Eldridge.

08:58.178 --> 08:59.779
I hope he wasn't
too much trouble.

08:59.780 --> 09:01.080
Trouble?

09:01.081 --> 09:03.182
He was an angel.
Come on in.

09:05.385 --> 09:06.853
* Superdad. *

09:06.854 --> 09:08.888
* Men. *

09:11.153 --> 09:12.887
* Men. *

09:12.888 --> 09:15.089
Thank you so much, Alan.

09:15.090 --> 09:16.857
Well, hey, Eldridge
is welcome anytime.

09:16.858 --> 09:18.326
We single parents
have to stick together.

09:18.327 --> 09:19.660
Yeah.
See you, buddy.

09:19.661 --> 09:21.262
Yeah, bite me.

09:21.263 --> 09:22.730
I heard that, young man.

09:22.731 --> 09:24.231
Good for you.
Get in the car.

09:24.232 --> 09:26.901
Can I drive?
Not with a suspended license, you can't.

09:26.902 --> 09:30.071
You suck!
And you're ruining my life!

09:30.072 --> 09:32.373
Okay, bye-bye.

09:38.780 --> 09:40.281
Yes?

09:40.282 --> 09:43.250
What happened to giving her
a piece of your mind?

09:43.251 --> 09:45.786
Oh, come on.
We both know what happened.

09:45.787 --> 09:47.488
Right.

09:47.489 --> 09:51.225
Piece of tail always trumps
piece of mind, doesn't it?

09:51.226 --> 09:52.526
What do you want from me?

09:52.527 --> 09:53.594
She's a beautiful woman.

09:53.595 --> 09:54.995
She's been through
a tough divorce.

09:54.996 --> 09:57.031
She raising a teenage son
by herself.

09:57.032 --> 09:58.165
Last thing she needs

09:58.166 --> 10:00.067
is me dumpinmore
problems in her lap.

10:00.869 --> 10:03.003
So, what are your plans
for her lap?

10:03.004 --> 10:04.705
I don't know.
I... I might call her.

10:04.706 --> 10:05.773
We'll see.

10:05.774 --> 10:07.074
You're unbelievable.

10:07.075 --> 10:08.309
Your son finally gets a friend,

10:08.310 --> 10:10.211
and you're going to tr
to nail his mother?

10:10.212 --> 10:11.545
All right, okay, first of all,

10:11.546 --> 10:13.547
with a classy woman like
Lyndsey, there's no nailing.

10:13.548 --> 10:15.349
There's, uh...
there's dating and bonding

10:15.350 --> 10:16.984
and-and getting
to know one another.

10:16.985 --> 10:19.687
And then, you know, eventually
consummating the relationship

10:19.688 --> 10:21.555
with mutual respect and caring.

10:21.556 --> 10:23.190
Oh, grow up.

10:23.191 --> 10:27.094
This is a hot divorced mom
from the Valley.

10:27.095 --> 10:28.796
You're going to need
three penises

10:28.797 --> 10:31.732
and a set of jumper cables
just to get her attention.

10:31.733 --> 10:34.368
Oh, you're disgusting.

10:34.369 --> 10:35.903
Hey, I'm not the one trying

10:35.904 --> 10:38.205
to bang the drummer's mom
slowly.

10:38.206 --> 10:39.640
Don't you judge me.

10:39.641 --> 10:42.343
Why not?

10:43.412 --> 10:46.213
You've slept with one
of Jake's teachers,

10:46.214 --> 10:48.449
his den mother,
his karate instructor,

10:48.450 --> 10:51.051
his ballet teacher,
and his aunt.

10:51.052 --> 10:54.388
Great. So five wrongs
make a right.

10:54.389 --> 10:55.790
What?

10:55.791 --> 10:58.592
If I jump off a bridge and land
on top of some broad Jake knows,

10:58.593 --> 11:00.628
that makes it okay
for you to do it, too?

11:00.629 --> 11:02.430
What?

11:02.431 --> 11:04.298
I think I've made my point.

11:08.069 --> 11:09.703
What?

11:11.473 --> 11:13.607
* Men. *

11:16.244 --> 11:18.112
I'm never gonna drink again.

11:18.113 --> 11:20.748
Quitter.

11:20.749 --> 11:21.782
Charlie?

11:21.783 --> 11:23.017
Oh, right.

11:23.018 --> 11:24.385
Atta boy.

11:25.921 --> 11:27.955
Here's your wastebasket.

11:27.956 --> 11:29.256
I rinsed it out,

11:29.257 --> 11:32.259
but there are still some
tiny chunks in the weave.

11:32.260 --> 11:35.329
Maybe you could use
your dad's Waterpik.

11:35.330 --> 11:37.264
Give the kid a break, Berta.

11:37.265 --> 11:38.332
He's hung over.

11:38.333 --> 11:41.602
Oh, the poor dear.

11:42.971 --> 11:46.507
Next time, tell your friends
to puke out the window.

11:47.609 --> 11:51.245
Want to know
a surefire hangover cure?

11:52.481 --> 11:53.948
Never stop drinking.

11:55.350 --> 11:55.950
Charlie?

11:55.951 --> 11:57.184
Let me finish.

11:57.185 --> 11:59.653
Or never start
in the first place.

12:00.755 --> 12:02.556
See how I turned that around?

12:02.557 --> 12:04.258
Bring it home, Dr. Cosby.

12:06.361 --> 12:07.761
All right, for starters,

12:07.762 --> 12:10.364
you and Eldridge stole beer
that did not belong to you.

12:10.365 --> 12:12.199
That is not how I raised you.

12:13.468 --> 12:15.970
Now to the issue
of underage drinking.

12:15.971 --> 12:20.374
Not only is it against the law,
alcohol destroys brain cells.

12:20.375 --> 12:21.475
Alan, Alan,

12:21.476 --> 12:23.477
you gotta tailor the pitch
to the audience.

12:23.478 --> 12:24.211
What do you mean?

12:24.212 --> 12:25.412
Forget brain cells.

12:25.413 --> 12:31.051
Jake, listen to me.
This is very important.

12:31.052 --> 12:33.754
You're kidding.

12:33.755 --> 12:37.525
I can't tell you
how many times I've said,

12:37.526 --> 12:40.227
"This has never happened
before."

12:41.496 --> 12:43.330
Huh.

12:44.499 --> 12:45.799
Where are you going?

12:45.800 --> 12:47.902
To check out your theory.

12:49.838 --> 12:53.974
Remember: he's your son,
and you love him.

12:53.975 --> 12:59.213
* Up, up, and away in my... *

12:59.214 --> 13:01.615
Dr. Alan Harper.
May I help you?...

13:01.616 --> 13:04.218
Oh, oh, hi, Lyndsey.

13:04.219 --> 13:07.488
No, no, you're
not interrupting.

13:07.489 --> 13:08.989
Just doin' some
stomach crunches.

13:08.990 --> 13:10.124
Hang on.

13:10.125 --> 13:11.392
And... a thousand.

13:11.393 --> 13:13.694
So what's up?

13:13.695 --> 13:15.829
Uh, tonight?

13:15.830 --> 13:18.365
Sure, sure, I'd love to.

13:18.366 --> 13:20.301
Yeah, yeah, I know that place.

13:20.302 --> 13:22.303
8:00? Perfect.

13:22.304 --> 13:23.370
See you then.

13:23.371 --> 13:24.572
How about that?

13:24.573 --> 13:26.707
<i>She called me.
Wants to have drinks.</i>

13:26.708 --> 13:28.709
Nice.
What are you gonna tell Jake?

13:28.710 --> 13:30.678
Who?

13:30.679 --> 13:33.514
I mean, what do you mean?

13:33.515 --> 13:34.815
I mean, are you gonna te him

13:34.816 --> 13:36.216
you're hookin' up
with his buddy's mom?

13:36.217 --> 13:38.752
Okay, first of a, nobody said
anything about hooking up.

13:38.753 --> 13:40.154
It's just drinks.

13:40.155 --> 13:42.690
And-and second of all, Jake nt
out and had drinks last night

13:42.691 --> 13:43.958
<i>and didn't tell me.</i>

13:46.695 --> 13:49.797
Man, that's the most lame-ass
rationalization

13:49.798 --> 13:52.232
for questionable behavior
I've ever heard from you.

13:52.233 --> 13:53.467
Yeah, so?

13:53.468 --> 13:55.235
Kudos.

13:57.372 --> 13:59.873
Hey, Uncle Charlie?
You were wrong.

14:05.647 --> 14:07.514
* Men. *

14:08.283 --> 14:10.651
It is so nice to get out
of the house

14:10.652 --> 14:12.319
and spend time
with another grownup.

14:12.320 --> 14:13.354
I know.

14:13.355 --> 14:15.289
It's hard to be a single parent.

14:15.290 --> 14:16.423
Thankless, really.

14:16.424 --> 14:17.925
Oh, tell me about it.

14:17.926 --> 14:18.892
Dealing with the ex.

14:18.893 --> 14:19.827
Setting boundaries.

14:19.828 --> 14:20.494
The loneliness.

14:20.495 --> 14:21.495
The frustration.

14:21.496 --> 14:21.829
It's all worth it though.

14:21.830 --> 14:22.296
You're so dirty!
The frustration.

14:22.297 --> 14:23.631
<i>I'm a dirty mom!</i>

14:23.632 --> 14:27.101
<i>My son is the greatest
gift of my life.</i>

14:27.102 --> 14:28.402
Mine, too.

14:28.403 --> 14:30.971
I can't imagine loving anything
more than I love Jake.

14:30.972 --> 14:32.473
To our children.

14:32.474 --> 14:34.375
Our children.

14:34.376 --> 14:36.677
Tell me I'm a good mom!

14:36.678 --> 14:38.178
Oh, you're a good mom!

14:38.179 --> 14:40.080
<i>I'm a dirty mom!</i>

14:40.081 --> 14:42.282
Oh, you're so dirty!

14:43.985 --> 14:45.319
Uh, whoopsie!

14:45.320 --> 14:46.754
Automatic flusher.

14:46.755 --> 14:48.889
Do, do that again!

14:48.890 --> 14:51.258
Okay.

14:52.360 --> 14:53.861
Not the toilet!

14:53.862 --> 14:55.396
Sorry! Sorry!

14:55.864 --> 14:58.032
* Men. *

15:09.577 --> 15:10.644
Hey!

15:10.645 --> 15:13.514
Hey-hey-hey-hey-
hey-hey!

15:13.515 --> 15:14.948
Aren't you grounded?

15:14.949 --> 15:18.318
Um, I think that's just
when my dad's here.

15:18.319 --> 15:20.387
Get in the house...

15:20.388 --> 15:22.556
all of you.

15:22.557 --> 15:24.358
I thought you were cool.

15:24.359 --> 15:26.827
No, you didn't.

15:28.863 --> 15:29.997
How old are you?

15:29.998 --> 15:30.664
Sixteen.

15:30.665 --> 15:31.598
What about you?
Same.

15:31.599 --> 15:32.666
That's what I thought.

15:32.667 --> 15:34.368
We were just goin' down
to the beach.

15:34.369 --> 15:35.636
Nobody asked you.

15:35.637 --> 15:38.639
I want you to listen to this

15:38.640 --> 15:42.543
and tell me if it makes you
wanna watch the TV show.

15:47.482 --> 15:50.217
* Larry was just a single dad *

15:50.218 --> 15:54.188
* Till a toxic spil
in the science lab *

15:54.189 --> 15:57.825
* Gave him super strength
and X-ray eyes *

15:57.826 --> 16:01.395
* He cooks, he cleans,
and now he flies *

16:01.396 --> 16:04.698
* Superdad! *

16:04.699 --> 16:06.467
* He's a super-bad,
fightin' mad *

16:06.468 --> 16:10.104
* College grad,
wearin' plaid Superdad! *

16:12.140 --> 16:14.675
Oh, my
God, that's great!

16:14.676 --> 16:16.810
Absolutely fantastic.
Yeah, I would so watch that.

16:16.811 --> 16:17.878
You wrote that?

16:17.879 --> 16:18.979
You think?

16:18.980 --> 16:20.214
Yeah, definitely. Yeah.

16:20.215 --> 16:22.816
Oh, yeah, really makes you
wanna see the show.

16:22.817 --> 16:25.786
Thanks. Thank you.

16:25.787 --> 16:28.989
All right, well, I guess
you guys all wanna get going.

16:28.990 --> 16:32.926
Yeah. Yeah, let's go. Yeah.

16:32.927 --> 16:33.694
Psst, Jake.

16:33.695 --> 16:35.028
Yeah?

16:35.029 --> 16:36.930
If you've got a choice,
take the tall one.

16:36.931 --> 16:37.831
Why?

16:37.832 --> 16:38.866
Trust me.

16:38.867 --> 16:40.434
It's my superpower.

16:40.435 --> 16:41.935
Thanks.

16:44.939 --> 16:46.607
Super Uncle!

16:46.608 --> 16:48.342
* Men. *

16:51.065 --> 16:52.632
* Men. *

16:54.902 --> 16:57.103
I'm back.

16:57.104 --> 17:00.073
Oh, good.
I was starting to worry.

17:00.074 --> 17:01.675
How'd it go with Jake?

17:02.543 --> 17:05.244
Hardly knew he was here.

17:05.246 --> 17:07.948
Can you keep a secret?

17:07.949 --> 17:12.152
The real question is
"Can I remember a secret?"

17:12.153 --> 17:13.586
You were right.

17:13.587 --> 17:15.288
That's no secret.

17:15.289 --> 17:17.324
I- I mean about Lyndsey.

17:17.325 --> 17:18.692
Who's Lyndsey?

17:18.693 --> 17:20.260
Eldridge's mom.

17:20.261 --> 17:23.063
Who's Eldridge?

17:23.064 --> 17:24.798
Jake's friend.

17:24.799 --> 17:25.898
The drummer?

17:25.900 --> 17:28.568
Anyway, we did wind up
having sex.

17:28.569 --> 17:31.304
You and me?

17:31.305 --> 17:34.240
You really need
to get into a program.

17:35.810 --> 17:37.877
It's not funny anymore.

17:37.878 --> 17:40.246
Humor is very subjective.

17:40.247 --> 17:41.648
Come on. Be serious.

17:41.649 --> 17:43.283
I'm just telling y
about Lyndsey

17:43.284 --> 17:45.685
because I may need you
to cover for me with Jake.

17:45.686 --> 17:47.587
Don't worry.
I got your back.

17:47.588 --> 17:48.455
ThanksCharlie.

17:48.456 --> 17:50.456
Good night.

17:55.930 --> 17:57.063
Is he gone?

17:57.064 --> 17:59.399
Who?

17:59.400 --> 18:01.134
Dad.

18:01.135 --> 18:02.969
Oh. Yeah.

18:02.970 --> 18:04.571
Thanks.

18:04.572 --> 18:06.539
Don't worry. I got your back.

18:06.540 --> 18:10.877
Good night.
