'In the criminal justice system,

00:02.953 --> 00:06.665

00:20.803 --> 00:23.639
I reserved them last week.

00:24.265 --> 00:26.349
Yeah. Hold on one second.

00:26.892 --> 00:32.772
Hello? Yeah. What's it at?
Well, hell, yeah, that's a great price!

00:32.814 --> 00:37.193
Let's do it. We'll buy again
when it gets back down to 30.

00:37.235 --> 00:42.490
No, don't buy it now,
we're gonna sell it all. Can you hear me?

00:42.532 --> 00:45.409
We're gonna sell it all! Hello?

00:45.451 --> 00:48.120
Josh, are you still there? Josh?

01:25.530 --> 01:28.867
Open your mouth, I'll slit your throat, bitch!

02:51.819 --> 02:55.531
- The A or the C train?
- The C, now stopped at Spring St.

02:55.573 --> 02:57.740
Line is shut. Let's get moving on this.

02:57.782 --> 02:59.659
- Same guy?
- Same MO.

02:59.701 --> 03:03.997
Waits till the train's almost at the station,
seconds later he's gone.

03:04.038 --> 03:07.500
- No one says, 'How typical!'
- Seven times in six months.

03:07.542 --> 03:10.169
Makes it three times this month.

03:10.211 --> 03:12.755
Hey, what's the matter with you?

03:12.797 --> 03:15.257
Today is my wedding anniversary.

03:15.299 --> 03:18.677
Excuse me. Which one?

03:18.719 --> 03:20.804
Exactly.

03:22.639 --> 03:27.269
- Between Fulton and Chambers Street.
- Two stops before this one.

03:27.310 --> 03:30.230
- So the train kept rolling?
- Right.

03:30.272 --> 03:32.815
Took her that long to find a Transit cop?

03:32.857 --> 03:35.401
Hey! Who are you?

03:35.442 --> 03:38.195
- He's a Post reporter.
- Nick Ganzner.

03:38.237 --> 03:41.448
- We're all working together.
- Yeah, right.

03:41.490 --> 03:43.784
Anyway, once we heard, we shut down.

03:43.826 --> 03:47.579
- And the stations two stops back?
- Got 'em wrapped up like a present.

03:47.620 --> 03:51.124
- Good. No peeking.
- When can we get the train rolling?

03:51.165 --> 03:53.710
- Anything?
- Everything and nothing.

03:53.751 --> 03:55.503
- Covers your ass.
- Problem?

03:55.545 --> 03:58.339
- I hate bureaucrats.
- Don't look in the mirror.

03:58.381 --> 04:01.342
- I try not to.
- Anti-graffiti metal. Resists oil.

04:01.384 --> 04:03.803
The spray-paint resists oils in the hands.

04:03.845 --> 04:07.180
- No prints?
- Several hundred on the window.

04:07.222 --> 04:10.433
- Footprints?
- Just a couple of partials.

04:10.475 --> 04:13.478
- What else?
- Right here.

04:16.231 --> 04:19.942
If I hadn't stopped for coffee,
I'd have got a different train.

04:19.985 --> 04:22.194
- It's not your fault.
- I know!

04:22.236 --> 04:26.824
- Jen, where'd you get on the train?
- Hoyt-Schermerhorn.

04:26.865 --> 04:31.036
I was headed up to 50th Street.
At the station I stopped for a latte.

04:31.078 --> 04:34.289
Did you see him at the coffee house?
On the platform?

04:34.331 --> 04:36.208
I don't know.

04:36.250 --> 04:41.754
- What did you do when he attacked?
- I just stood there.

04:41.796 --> 04:46.759
It all happened so quickly,
I couldn't believe it.

04:46.801 --> 04:48.928
So much for taking kick boxing.

04:50.012 --> 04:55.475
We've a description
from the previous attack...

04:56.309 --> 04:59.688
Excuse me. From the previous attacks.

04:59.729 --> 05:01.815
Does this man look familiar?

05:03.900 --> 05:09.698
Well, yes, that looks like him.
It also looks like the Unabomber.

05:09.739 --> 05:12.241
Did you get a good look at him?

05:13.534 --> 05:15.244
Yeah.

05:15.285 --> 05:17.371
He was thin,

05:17.413 --> 05:22.543
sandy brown, a pointy... beak nose.

05:22.584 --> 05:25.629
- How tall was he?
- I don't know.

05:25.671 --> 05:28.673
He had me pinned, you know.

05:29.841 --> 05:32.927
He had a knife or something.

05:32.969 --> 05:35.304
Did you see what he was wearing?

05:37.723 --> 05:41.435
Yeah. He was wearing, uh, dark clothes

05:41.477 --> 05:44.689
and a... a hooded sweatshirt.

05:47.607 --> 05:49.984
He was panting at me.

05:51.611 --> 05:53.947
He was panting like a dog.

05:55.782 --> 05:57.867
I don't believe this guy.

06:01.329 --> 06:06.708
And anyway... he left his mark on my dress.

06:10.921 --> 06:15.259
I wasn't even sure what he was doing
at first. I get so in the zone.

06:15.300 --> 06:19.971
On the train, ignoring people selling things,
you learn not to see.

06:20.012 --> 06:23.474
- And when you weren't in the zone?
- He was on her and gone.

06:23.516 --> 06:25.976
- Notice him before?
- I'd just gotten on.

06:26.018 --> 06:28.938
- Did he get on with you?
- I don't know.

06:28.979 --> 06:32.858
- You get a look at him?
- He was white, shorter than I.

06:32.900 --> 06:34.985
How tall are you?

06:35.027 --> 06:39.864
I'm six-three. So, uh... five-ten.

06:39.906 --> 06:41.491
You look at his face?

06:41.533 --> 06:44.911
No, he had a hooded sweatshirt
and a heavy jacket.

06:44.953 --> 06:47.247
- What kind of jacket?
- Navy.

06:47.288 --> 06:52.001
- A pea coat?
- I was Air Force... Yeah, a navy pea coat.

06:52.043 --> 06:55.379
- What about his pants?
- His what?

06:55.420 --> 06:57.506
Pants. His pants.

06:57.547 --> 07:02.052
Dirty. Drips, streaks, like a painter.
I kept my distance.

07:02.094 --> 07:06.014
- I didn't want paint on me.
- Notice him before he was on her?

07:06.056 --> 07:08.141
No.

07:08.974 --> 07:12.478
So he's on her
and you're worried about your coat?

07:17.733 --> 07:22.071
Today's attack between
Chambers Street Station and Fulton

07:22.112 --> 07:26.115
fits into our pattern,
which is that there is no pattern.

07:26.157 --> 07:30.536
- We can assume...
- You assume, we do the footwork.

07:30.578 --> 07:33.331
Your footwork lead to any profile yet?

07:33.414 --> 07:36.542
It did. A guy who wants to get caught.

07:36.584 --> 07:41.839
So put decoys and ghosts
on the trains and look for pervs.

07:41.881 --> 07:46.968
Why don't you request Transit cops
and security cameras on all trains?

07:47.010 --> 07:51.264
- Get with the 21st century, right?
- We are. Next year.

07:51.306 --> 07:54.559
But all the computers in the world
won't stop a guy

07:54.601 --> 07:58.355
- sticking his hand up a girl's skirt.
- Rape, Greenberg!

07:58.396 --> 08:04.443
Not fondling, unwarranted advances.
Rape! On your subway, remember?

08:10.407 --> 08:13.369
I get on at Nostrand, close to where I live.

08:13.410 --> 08:18.039
- Always get on the train the same time?
- Yes. Or sometime if I'm late

08:18.081 --> 08:21.292
- I stop for grocery.
- Ever seen the guy before?

08:21.334 --> 08:26.464
Well, he looked like everyone else.
Anyway, I don't look at men.

08:26.506 --> 08:30.802
So you don't know if he was
on the train when you got on?

08:30.843 --> 08:32.678
Yes. Maybe.

08:32.720 --> 08:36.264
- Did he ever talk to anyone?
- Not to me.

08:37.015 --> 08:39.893
Did you hear him say anything
to the woman?

08:39.934 --> 08:42.520
He said somet'ing.

08:42.562 --> 08:45.148
I didn't hear what he said.

08:45.190 --> 08:49.027
Maybe he wasn't on the train
when I got on.

08:49.069 --> 08:51.570
OK. Thanks.

08:55.699 --> 09:00.496
Listen up, people. Excuse me.
This is Dr Audrey Jackson,

09:00.537 --> 09:02.706
a forensic psychologist.

09:02.748 --> 09:07.085
The Deputy Commissioner
decided she should join our team.

09:07.877 --> 09:09.962
Nice to meet you.

09:12.632 --> 09:15.301
- So?
- A witness saw paint spots

09:15.343 --> 09:18.471
- on the guy's pants.
- A painter, construction.

09:18.512 --> 09:22.225
- Does that narrow our priors?
- We found a plasterer

09:22.266 --> 09:26.519
with priors for flashing,
but he lost a fight with a.44 last month.

09:26.561 --> 09:30.523
Hardware stores, paint supply
near the stations?

09:30.565 --> 09:34.611
- I'm all over it, Captain.
- Very good. This latest victim,

09:34.652 --> 09:37.113
how does she resemble other victims?

09:37.155 --> 09:39.699
All were women wearing skirts.

09:39.741 --> 09:42.493
Women wearing skirts? That all you got?

09:44.787 --> 09:49.541
- Women wearing skirts on the subway.
- All different ages, races.

09:49.583 --> 09:51.752
Body types? Big, little?

09:51.793 --> 09:55.005
- Does he overpower them?
- He uses a knife.

09:55.047 --> 09:58.507
It's safe to say part of the thrill
is overpowering them.

09:58.549 --> 10:01.177
Yes, it's safe to say that.

10:01.218 --> 10:07.475
I understand your resistance, but I'm here
to offer psychological insight that may help.

10:07.516 --> 10:10.227
We're over the moon to have your help.

10:10.269 --> 10:13.897
So, what are your psychological insights?

10:13.938 --> 10:18.401
On this guy? Well, he's a dog.
What gets him off is the hunt.

10:18.443 --> 10:21.613
Maybe he gets on a train
when he has an hour free

10:21.654 --> 10:25.033
or rides all day
until he finds the perfect victim.

10:25.074 --> 10:29.370
- You make it sound like foreplay.
- To him, it is. With this guy,

10:29.412 --> 10:32.581
you can't plant a decoy because
he doesn't have a type.

10:32.623 --> 10:34.541
So we wait.

10:34.583 --> 10:36.752
- We wait.
- Wait's over.

10:36.793 --> 10:40.380
- The dog found another fire hydrant.
- Let's go.

10:44.760 --> 10:47.970
- What happened?
- Made your life a lot easier.

10:48.012 --> 10:52.558
- What happened?
- Ballsy old lady sees the guy attack the girl.

10:52.600 --> 10:55.895
Cries wolf.
One guy wrestles him to the ground,

10:55.936 --> 10:59.982
another pulls the emergency brake
between Lincoln Center and Columbus.

11:00.024 --> 11:03.903
I walk back in the tunnel,
apprehend the suspect.

11:09.949 --> 11:12.035
Call me the dog-catcher.

11:19.208 --> 11:23.503
- What happened?
- Train jerked, I fell against her.

11:23.545 --> 11:25.339
- You fell?
- I fell.

11:25.380 --> 11:28.008
- How many times?
- How many times what?

11:28.050 --> 11:30.469
How many times did you fall against her?

11:30.510 --> 11:33.013
- She overreacted.
- Or underreacted.

11:33.055 --> 11:36.224
I had one hand on the pole,
the other in my pocket.

11:36.266 --> 11:39.602
- 'Doing what?'
- 'I was just standing!'

11:39.643 --> 11:43.689
- 'It's how I stand.'
- 'Witnesses put you on top of her.'

11:43.731 --> 11:45.232
'The train jerked.'

11:45.274 --> 11:47.526
What you got on your pants?

11:47.568 --> 11:51.780
- Paint.
- Will you stand up for me?

11:51.822 --> 11:54.949
- Paint from what?
- A window I did.

11:54.991 --> 11:59.787
- What do you mean, a window?
- I'm not sure I...

12:00.788 --> 12:03.958
- I'm a little...
- Confused, yeah. She means,

12:04.000 --> 12:08.504
you paint houses for a living,
you're in paint all day long. Right?

12:08.546 --> 12:13.675
Now, how do you know that splatter
came from... a window, right?

12:13.717 --> 12:14.843
Right.

12:17.637 --> 12:21.808
A window, my ass.
Take off your pants, please.

12:21.850 --> 12:24.477
- Do I have to?
- Yeah, you do.

12:24.519 --> 12:27.188
- Can I say something?
- By all means.

12:27.230 --> 12:29.690
- I wanna explain something.
- Please.

12:29.732 --> 12:34.028
- I meant a store window.
- Explain further.

12:34.069 --> 12:36.238
I kinda do window displays.

12:36.280 --> 12:37.865
Kinda?

12:37.906 --> 12:41.827
- Window displays, I make them.
- Why didn't you say so before?

12:41.869 --> 12:45.621
- People think it's a little fruity.
- But you're not.

12:45.663 --> 12:48.166
- You like women.
- Yeah! No, I mean...

12:48.207 --> 12:52.128
- Take off your pants, please.
- You like him for this?

12:52.170 --> 12:57.341
- Do I like him?
- For this. The lack of eye contact.

12:57.383 --> 13:00.219
Like a kid lying about a book he didn't read.

13:00.261 --> 13:02.262
He's guilty about something.

13:02.304 --> 13:05.932
Maybe he's Catholic,
feels guilty about everything.

13:05.974 --> 13:07.642
'Stay standing.'

13:07.684 --> 13:14.649
We're gonna do a DNA check
on the... sample in these pants.

13:14.691 --> 13:18.861
We'll match it against...
the seven other rapes that you did.

13:18.902 --> 13:22.906
- I didn't do seven others.
- Eight, if the old lady hadn't screamed.

13:22.948 --> 13:26.326
- No, sir, no.
- There's a pocket missing.

13:26.368 --> 13:29.079
- There is?
- You a leftie or a rightie?

13:29.121 --> 13:30.998
- Leftie.
- Left pocket.

13:31.039 --> 13:33.417
- Naturally.
- What are you getting at?

13:33.459 --> 13:35.960
Oldest perv trick in the book.

13:36.002 --> 13:39.505
'Want some change? Candy?
It's in my pocket.'

13:39.547 --> 13:42.508
But it's not coins or peppermints,
it's your willy.

13:42.550 --> 13:48.264
No. I keep my razor knife
in my left pocket. It must've cut a hole.

13:49.765 --> 13:53.560
- Where's that knife now?
- In my tool kit.

13:53.601 --> 13:56.104
Bruce, we're gonna put you under arrest.

13:56.146 --> 13:59.941
We'll see how his story jives
with the witnesses.

13:59.983 --> 14:03.737
- The older woman?
- And the guy who wrestled him down.

14:03.778 --> 14:06.364
Nobody looks at anybody on the subway,

14:06.406 --> 14:10.742
except for this guy staring at this girl,
boring holes in her.

14:10.784 --> 14:13.829
- Then he started to circle her.
- On a full train?

14:13.871 --> 14:17.207
He still had room to move,
which got my attention.

14:17.249 --> 14:21.962
Nobody moves on the subway
until the train nears the station.

14:22.004 --> 14:26.757
- This guy had no reason to move.
- So they were both standing?

14:26.799 --> 14:29.719
He had his hands shoved deep
in his pockets,

14:29.760 --> 14:32.346
she was leaning against a pole, reading.

14:32.388 --> 14:36.183
- Then what happened?
- The train jerked.

14:36.225 --> 14:40.813
He grabbed hold of that metal pole
so he wouldn't run into her.

14:40.855 --> 14:42.939
Did he touch her?

14:44.315 --> 14:50.196
As he adjusted himself, was it
the train throwing him up against her

14:50.238 --> 14:52.490
or was it on purpose?

14:52.532 --> 14:57.745
Who knows? But when he bent his knees
and started to rub up against her,

14:57.787 --> 15:00.664
- that was on purpose.
- What did she do?

15:00.706 --> 15:05.377
Nothing! That's why I said something.
Shouted it out to the whole car.

15:05.419 --> 15:11.133
For all the times I've stood there
and taken it, enough already.

15:11.967 --> 15:16.095
- Missed you at Columbus Circle.
- Missed you too.

15:16.137 --> 15:20.641
- Bruce Abbott, 41, arrested today?
- What do you want from me?

15:20.683 --> 15:23.394
- Deep background.
- Looks promising.

15:23.436 --> 15:26.063
Is he the one? People wanna feel safe.

15:26.105 --> 15:30.693
- People should never let their guard down.
- No, they shouldn't.

15:30.734 --> 15:32.902
Chinese Wall.

15:32.944 --> 15:36.823
- Moo shoo?
- Dim sum. Eight o'clock.

15:39.659 --> 15:43.496
I didn't see much, not until I heard
the old lady screaming.

15:43.538 --> 15:48.376
- Did she scream or say something?
- At first, I heard, 'Cut it out!'

15:48.418 --> 15:50.961
But then she kept going on.
'Somebody help!'

15:51.002 --> 15:54.548
So I looked. She points
and I see the guy on top of the girl.

15:54.589 --> 15:59.553
- On her how?
- On top of her, pushing into her.

15:59.594 --> 16:03.431
So, with the lady yelling,
I figured this had to be the guy.

16:03.473 --> 16:06.684
- I ran over, put a nelson on him.
- Full or half?

16:06.725 --> 16:09.728
Full. How's she doing, by the way?

16:09.770 --> 16:12.815
- She's being taken care of. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

16:12.856 --> 16:17.027
She says he never penetrated her.
I did a pelvic, no signs of trauma.

16:17.069 --> 16:21.115
- Did you do a UV on the clothes?
- Yeah. And nothing.

16:21.156 --> 16:24.283
- She says nothing happened.
- So she's in denial?

16:24.325 --> 16:27.203
Maybe, or nothing happened.

16:28.162 --> 16:32.917
Did he rub up against me? Yes.
Is that unusual during rush hour? No!

16:32.959 --> 16:36.337
- Somebody always touches you?
- Half of subway travel

16:36.379 --> 16:39.798
is keeping your purse zipped,
jacket buttoned.

16:39.840 --> 16:43.635
- What's the other half?
- Keeping people's hands in sight.

16:43.677 --> 16:48.348
- Kinda hard if you're reading.
- No, you read a line, scan the car.

16:48.390 --> 16:51.851
Read a line, scan the car.
And mind your own business.

16:51.893 --> 16:54.771
- Which that lady should do.
- He didn't rape you?

16:54.813 --> 16:58.190
He didn't even flash me.
That happened two weeks ago

16:58.232 --> 17:01.402
- as we pulled into Lexington Avenue.
- What?

17:01.443 --> 17:05.239
They can't get rid of
the smell in the subway.

17:05.280 --> 17:10.618
Everybody's BO, fast food... I wish
I had a Mustang and lived in the 'burbs.

17:10.661 --> 17:12.746
Amen, sister.

17:13.412 --> 17:17.708
- He didn't rape her.
- Maybe he didn't get the chance.

17:17.750 --> 17:21.503
- The seven other CWs?
- Bring 'em here, do a line-up.

17:21.546 --> 17:25.675
How do we do that?
Each one was assaulted on Public Transit.

17:25.715 --> 17:28.761
- Gonna let them get the train here?
- Good point.

17:28.803 --> 17:32.305
- Not our problem.
- Really?

17:32.347 --> 17:36.184
You think we should bring each woman
down here personally?

17:36.226 --> 17:39.646
Yeah. Every time these women
get on the train,

17:39.688 --> 17:43.441
if they still do,
their anxiety level goes through the roof.

17:43.483 --> 17:47.236
It's a bad state of mind to make an ID.
Which is our problem.

17:47.277 --> 17:51.240
Maybe we could have the Transit guys
help us out on this.

17:51.281 --> 17:52.616
Or not.

17:52.658 --> 17:55.869
- Let's bring 'em in ourselves.
- All seven.

17:55.911 --> 17:58.622
All seven. Like Ms Jackson said,

17:58.664 --> 18:02.167
I want these seven IDs
to go as smooth as possible.

18:18.391 --> 18:21.101
Guess I'll still be taking cabs.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.455
Number two.

18:44.998 --> 18:47.417
Number two?

18:47.459 --> 18:51.755
Number two's eyes... at least.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.215
And his hands.

18:54.256 --> 18:56.467
Like number four's.

18:56.509 --> 19:00.179
- Number four?
- Yes. No.

19:02.681 --> 19:08.145
I see... parts... of him everywhere.

19:09.480 --> 19:14.400
- Every man on the street.
- Do you see him in there?

19:18.321 --> 19:22.742
No. But I wish more than anything that I did.

19:28.455 --> 19:30.791
Yeah. Number one.

19:42.886 --> 19:46.889
I don't know. Could be number four.

19:47.807 --> 19:51.560
- What if I'm wrong?
- Then it becomes a trial issue.

19:51.602 --> 19:55.564
- Trial?
- By then the DNA results will be back.

19:55.606 --> 19:58.025
The, er, stuff on my dress.

19:59.860 --> 20:03.279
So it doesn't really matter
if I'm right or wrong.

20:03.321 --> 20:07.825
- You don't need me at all.
- We need your ID to get an indictment.

20:07.867 --> 20:11.287
But in front of a jury,
it doesn't matter what I see here.

20:11.329 --> 20:14.374
All that matters
is that the stuff on my dress

20:14.415 --> 20:17.001
matches his... genetic material.

20:17.043 --> 20:20.295
How that material got there is what's crucial.

20:20.337 --> 20:22.422
I don't see him.

20:28.553 --> 20:32.182
You can rearrest him
if the DNA tests ever match up.

20:32.224 --> 20:35.142
- That'll take a miracle.
- They happen.

20:35.184 --> 20:37.728
I'd rearrest him on a lesser charge.

20:37.770 --> 20:42.358
Third-degree sexual misconduct
for fondling? Why cop to that

20:42.399 --> 20:46.570
- if he's got a pass on the rapes?
- Because he knows he's guilty.

20:46.612 --> 20:48.697
So use it.

20:52.241 --> 20:56.162
- It's about time.
- Meter's running. What do you care?

20:56.204 --> 21:00.041
- My client can ill afford...
- Shut up, Counsellor.

21:00.082 --> 21:05.004
Hi, I'm Audrey Jackson.
I'm a court-appointed shrink.

21:05.046 --> 21:09.633
- How you feelin'?
- I don't know. Not that hot.

21:09.674 --> 21:14.095
OK. Well, the police aren't gonna
charge you with the rapes.

21:14.137 --> 21:16.264
They know you didn't do it.

21:16.306 --> 21:21.770
- 'I didn't think they believed me.'
- 'They didn't, but that's their job.'

21:21.811 --> 21:24.814
'You like ridin' subways?'

21:26.190 --> 21:28.275
Yes.

21:29.610 --> 21:32.321
Well, the motion, you know?

21:33.197 --> 21:36.658
It rocks you, side to side. Front to back.

21:37.826 --> 21:40.621
- It's soothing?
- Yes.

21:40.662 --> 21:45.791
- Like... like being in a womb?
- Please! What's the point of this blather?

21:45.833 --> 21:48.711
- To help him feel better.
- That's my job.

21:48.753 --> 21:53.633
Your job is to get him
a lesser charge of fondling.

21:53.674 --> 21:58.429
I... came here from South Dakota.

21:58.471 --> 22:01.473
I was the geek in a farming community.

22:01.514 --> 22:09.105
I was artistic. So I came
to New York. It was... my dream.

22:09.147 --> 22:11.858
OK. What happened?

22:14.903 --> 22:16.987
I don't know.

22:17.946 --> 22:22.201
Everything just... evaporated.

22:24.494 --> 22:27.706
The other day, I got drunk.

22:27.748 --> 22:32.085
I went to some porno place
where they dance behind the window.

22:32.127 --> 22:37.298
The next thing I knew, my face
was against the glass and I was weeping.

22:38.341 --> 22:42.553
- For everything.
- So when you got on the subway,

22:42.595 --> 22:45.222
you had already relieved yourself?

22:47.266 --> 22:51.853
- So you weren't looking for sex?
- No! I just...

22:51.895 --> 22:54.272
Just what, Bruce?

22:57.150 --> 22:59.235
I was lonely.

23:00.028 --> 23:02.280
And I saw her.

23:02.322 --> 23:06.325
Then when I realised
what I was doing, then I pulled back.

23:06.366 --> 23:12.581
I just... wanted... some contact.

23:14.583 --> 23:15.625
OK.

23:17.336 --> 23:20.380
- He's not violent.
- He has a box-cutter.

23:20.422 --> 23:24.842
- To open boxes with, Captain.
- Tell me why he's not the rapist.

23:24.884 --> 23:28.304
You're looking for your classic power rapist.

23:28.345 --> 23:32.099
A guy who feels powerless, disenfranchised.

23:32.141 --> 23:35.603
- Right. My heart bleeds.
- You asked my opinion.

23:35.644 --> 23:39.231
He uses violence to gain control.
Once he gets it,

23:39.273 --> 23:42.734
- he uses it to prove his virility.
- Afterwards...?

23:42.775 --> 23:45.778
Afterwards, he goes back
to feeling powerless.

23:45.820 --> 23:48.531
That's why he wants to get caught.

23:48.573 --> 23:50.908
- This guy ran.
- Right.

23:50.950 --> 23:53.036
He's not ready to get caught.

23:58.165 --> 24:01.418
- This, er, subway rapist...
- Hold on, Nick.

24:01.543 --> 24:05.005
- Are we flirting or working?
- We're always working.

24:05.046 --> 24:07.924
- So you're not flirting?
- No.

24:07.966 --> 24:12.137
I'm offering my undying love
for the ten millionth time.

24:12.179 --> 24:16.974
Maybe tonight.
Ten million and one, you may get lucky.

24:17.016 --> 24:19.101
Really?

24:21.228 --> 24:24.565
Maybe your subway rapist
wants to spread his seed.

24:24.607 --> 24:26.734
Why is he my subway rapist?

24:26.775 --> 24:31.154
You've written 300 inches about this guy.
What are you saying?

24:31.195 --> 24:35.366
That if flowers and candy fail,
there's always an alternative?

24:35.408 --> 24:38.870
Some people are saying that.
They sell a lotta books.

24:38.911 --> 24:44.500
- I should write a book.
- You should. You know these people.

24:44.542 --> 24:45.960
No, I don't.

24:46.002 --> 24:50.172
You do. That's why people
move away from you on the sofa.

24:50.213 --> 24:52.465
You get inside sex offenders.

24:54.134 --> 24:56.261
Gee, how nice for me.

25:04.810 --> 25:06.895
- Well?
- Well what?

25:07.646 --> 25:09.732
I'm not moving away.

25:12.109 --> 25:14.194
I can see that.

25:24.120 --> 25:26.330
- What?
- Nothin'.

25:26.372 --> 25:30.877
We don't have to do this. It's fine.
You started it.

25:30.918 --> 25:34.547
I know. And I want to. It's just, uh...

25:34.589 --> 25:39.301
- It's just what?
- Sex crimes. You know?

25:40.677 --> 25:42.846
Ah, yeah.

25:42.887 --> 25:47.642
- What, you're seeing what I see?
- Yeah. I mean, you close your eyes.

25:47.684 --> 25:50.103
Is that it? To have sex?

25:51.062 --> 25:54.064
I have sex with my eyes wide open.

25:55.107 --> 25:58.569
- Tell me what you see.
- Aw, let's not talk.

25:58.610 --> 26:00.696
OK, I just...

26:00.737 --> 26:03.073
- Just what?
- I just want to.

26:03.699 --> 26:05.784
Me too.

26:09.621 --> 26:12.456
- Let's pretend.
- Pretend what?

26:12.498 --> 26:14.709
That I'm the guy on the subway.

26:14.750 --> 26:17.378
- OK, stop it.
- Just for fun.

26:17.420 --> 26:19.505
- Really, stop.
- What would you do?

26:19.547 --> 26:21.632
Oh, my God!

26:23.092 --> 26:29.055
Wow. I'm gonna go wash my face and my
hands and my mouth and there's the door.

26:29.097 --> 26:33.518
Make sure you're out
when I get outta here. Gone.

26:58.667 --> 26:59.835
Hey.

26:59.876 --> 27:02.336
- Have a seat.
- I just wanted to...

27:02.378 --> 27:04.255
It's uncanny.

27:05.965 --> 27:07.341
What is?

27:07.383 --> 27:12.221
How this reporter, Nick Ganzner,
seemed to get into the rapist's head.

27:12.263 --> 27:16.642
- Yeah, Captain...
- As if it's straight from the horse's mouth.

27:18.059 --> 27:23.356
- He's got quite a vivid imagination.
- Is that all?

27:25.441 --> 27:30.655
He was at my apartment.
I asked him to leave and... I turned my back.

27:30.697 --> 27:33.366
Never turn your back on a reporter.

27:35.075 --> 27:37.244
Believe me, I won't.

27:39.746 --> 27:43.417
- You want me to handle this?
- No. I will.

27:44.501 --> 27:48.797
There's been another rape.
Delancey Street Station.

27:49.464 --> 27:53.425
- Unbelievable. You and Jeffries.
- Are we...?

27:58.472 --> 28:02.518
- How's the woman?
- In shock. She's gone to hospital.

28:02.560 --> 28:05.187
- Anything different?
- A witness said

28:05.229 --> 28:08.564
that a card or something
fell out of the guy's pocket.

28:08.606 --> 28:11.943
- Where?
- Stairs to the platform. Be my guest.

28:19.367 --> 28:21.452
Nah, it's... it's nothing.

28:24.622 --> 28:27.958
You use the subway,
why do you need a parking stub?

28:27.999 --> 28:30.877
- Commuter?
- Queens, 6:50am today.

28:30.919 --> 28:33.797
- Hm, fresh lead.
- Fresh indeed.

28:33.839 --> 28:37.342
The car's not here?
This doesn't surprise you?

28:37.384 --> 28:40.470
- Can I see your records?
- How does one claim a car

28:40.512 --> 28:43.931
- without a ticket?
- Lost ticket pays maximum.

28:43.973 --> 28:46.642
This one was picked up a few hours ago.

28:46.684 --> 28:49.478
Lost ticket, you keep maximum.

28:49.520 --> 28:53.440
- I don't want to get fired.
- Did you know this guy?

28:53.482 --> 28:56.568
- Always parks here.
- What'd he look like?

28:56.610 --> 29:00.238
- White, skinny, pointy nose.
- What kinda cars?

29:00.279 --> 29:03.741
A couple of different kinds. A van, a truck...

29:03.783 --> 29:06.661
- But from the same place.
- Where he works?

29:06.702 --> 29:11.499
I guess so. Uh... Dewell's.
Dewell's Painting Contractors.

29:11.541 --> 29:15.044
- One white guy, Sal Avalino.
- How long's he been here?

29:15.085 --> 29:19.547
A year. Moved here from somewhere.
He's only part-time. Not even that.

29:19.589 --> 29:22.008
- What do you mean?
- When he takes a car,

29:22.050 --> 29:24.594
you never know when he'll come back.

29:24.636 --> 29:28.723
This morning he went out,
he comes back three hours later.

29:28.765 --> 29:30.767
I'm gonna can his ass one day.

29:30.809 --> 29:34.520
- Does he go at the same time every day?
- Depends on the job.

29:34.561 --> 29:39.108
A few days ago, he goes on a lunch break
that lasted all afternoon.

29:39.149 --> 29:43.362
- Maybe he drinks.
- I drink. Him, it's something else.

29:43.403 --> 29:46.281
- He here now?
- Should be.

29:47.866 --> 29:50.785
- Hey, Sal!
What?

29:55.706 --> 29:59.043
- Empty all your pockets, Picasso.
- I get it back?

29:59.085 --> 30:03.547
$12.36. Can we voucher Mr Avalino's
vast personal fortune?

30:03.589 --> 30:05.840
I'm just a house painter.

30:05.882 --> 30:09.552
Like Hitler. Another impotent case
who needed violence to get it up.

30:09.594 --> 30:14.599
Y membership, credit card,
driver's licence. Two of them!

30:14.641 --> 30:17.685
- Why two driver's licences?
- Mr Avalino?

30:17.727 --> 30:21.397
- I found it. I was gonna return it.
- But you forgot.

30:21.439 --> 30:24.566
- Who's Sidra Lonstein?
- I don't know.

30:25.359 --> 30:28.570
She's an organ donor.
Sal, who is she?

30:28.612 --> 30:32.282
- I don't know her.
- Yeah, you found it. Where?

30:32.324 --> 30:34.618
In the street. Maybe on the job.

30:34.660 --> 30:37.454
Or maybe in the subway. We'll find out.

30:37.496 --> 30:41.832
What else we got? Ooh, a Metro card.

30:41.874 --> 30:46.253
A record of your travels.
Let's see where the day took you.

30:49.840 --> 30:51.967
- Aw, great.
- What?

30:52.009 --> 30:55.679
- System's frozen.
- You call this doing your part?

30:55.721 --> 30:59.974
- Ancient technology. What do you want?
- The dates of the attacks.

31:00.016 --> 31:04.687
February 12th, March 19th,
March 28th, April 11th. We need them.

31:04.729 --> 31:08.691
Again I ask you,
what would you like me to do?

31:10.735 --> 31:13.612
I'd like you to go sit on the third rail.

31:14.529 --> 31:17.324
My client can't do a line-up now.

31:17.366 --> 31:20.744
- He can rest between the IDs.
- OK.

31:20.786 --> 31:25.082
- But he wants to be first in line.
- You wanna be number one, Sal?

31:25.123 --> 31:27.709
- Yeah.
- What, is that your lucky number?

31:27.751 --> 31:33.672
- As a matter of fact, it is.
- OK, number one it is. Good luck.

31:38.803 --> 31:42.181
- Number one.
- I'm sorry, you have to wait

31:42.223 --> 31:44.308
till all five are present.

31:45.893 --> 31:47.977
Number one.

31:48.811 --> 31:50.063
OK.

31:57.236 --> 32:00.990
- Now what?
- We'll contact you about testifying.

32:01.032 --> 32:04.034
- OK.
- Hey, Jen, you did great. Thank you.

32:04.076 --> 32:06.161
Yeah.

32:08.705 --> 32:10.457
- I forgot my scarf.
- I'll...

32:10.499 --> 32:12.751
- It was short and quick.
- Like him.

32:12.793 --> 32:16.213
- Little bastard!
- Everybody stop! You can't...

32:16.254 --> 32:19.216
- I can't what?
- Oh, great!

32:19.257 --> 32:21.550
- What did Jen say?
- That it was quick.

32:21.592 --> 32:24.303
- They can't talk! What...
- It happened so fast!

32:24.345 --> 32:28.515
- Work on your reflexes, son!
- Hey, in the street, I'm fine!

32:28.557 --> 32:31.477
I got six women yakking at once!

32:34.772 --> 32:38.399
They had prior knowledge
my client was in the line-up.

32:38.441 --> 32:41.361
What was said
was that the process was quick.

32:41.402 --> 32:43.863
- 'Like him.'
- Meaning your client?

32:43.905 --> 32:48.326
- Yes, Your Honour.
- Which prejudices the others.

32:48.367 --> 32:53.788
The certainty with which this victim
identified her attacker as Sal...

32:53.830 --> 32:56.875
A spectre of impropriety
hangs over all the witnesses.

32:56.917 --> 33:01.296
Apart from their contaminated testimony,
my client is linked to these crimes

33:01.338 --> 33:05.759
- by an unpaid parking stub.
- Plus a Metro card and eight DNA samples.

33:05.800 --> 33:09.262
Which means nothing without IDs
except that they had sex.

33:09.304 --> 33:10.471
Exactly.

33:10.512 --> 33:13.265
- Your Honour...
- Move to dismiss.

33:15.809 --> 33:18.270
Case dismissed.

33:24.777 --> 33:29.197
Consensual sex with a stranger
on the subway holding a box-cutter.

33:29.238 --> 33:32.742
- What planet is this judge from?
- Planet of the Apes.

33:32.783 --> 33:35.286
What about the Sidra Lonstein woman?

33:35.328 --> 33:38.873
Hasn't returned our calls.
DMV hasn't renewed her licence yet.

33:38.915 --> 33:42.627
Sal Avalino is well over 21,
he doesn't need fake ID!

33:42.668 --> 33:46.755
Her credit card numbers changed
months ago. So did her address.

33:46.796 --> 33:51.593
She could be one of his victims
and an uncontaminated witness.

33:51.634 --> 33:55.096
- Could we be that lucky?
- Take your partner and find out.

33:55.138 --> 33:57.223
- I'll go with you.
- Where's Jeffries?

33:57.265 --> 34:00.351
- She's waiting to arrest him.
- I see.

34:01.769 --> 34:05.481
Detective, I want you
to run this down for me. Thanks.

34:32.465 --> 34:36.259
- Help you?
- We're looking for Sidra Lonstein.

34:36.301 --> 34:40.346
Ah, Sidra, the cleaning lady
with the Mona Lisa smile.

34:40.388 --> 34:42.639
- Is she around?
- She's at work.

34:42.681 --> 34:45.143
- Where?
- Subway. 34th Street.

34:45.185 --> 34:48.813
- That's five blocks from here.
- She always laughs about it.

34:48.855 --> 34:53.358
She's gotta ride the subway to 96th Street,
punch in, then back here.

34:53.400 --> 34:57.195
Five blocks from her house.
Never complains, though.

34:57.237 --> 34:59.740
- She must be a saint.
- She is.

35:02.200 --> 35:06.747
- Nice article, Nicky.
- Olivia. I was just gonna call you.

35:06.788 --> 35:10.666
Of course. I got reamed by my boss
for letting you read

35:10.708 --> 35:14.712
- a confidential police transcript.
- I dug it up on my own.

35:14.754 --> 35:19.884
I know. Reporter's instinct.
But my captain won't care about details.

35:19.925 --> 35:24.013
- It looks like I screwed up.
- You're being too hard on yourself.

35:24.054 --> 35:26.639
Why don't you save it? Really.

35:28.183 --> 35:32.812
- What's this?
- Read it. It's a cold case.

35:32.854 --> 35:35.106
You want a good story, check that out.

35:37.942 --> 35:42.529
Philip Sternhagen,
convicted of a strangulation torture.

35:42.571 --> 35:46.033
- Who the hell is this?
- A man with a rich fantasy life,

35:46.074 --> 35:47.784
who couldn't stop.

35:47.826 --> 35:51.538
A man who uses women
without a twinge of regret.

35:51.580 --> 35:52.706
OK. OK.

35:52.748 --> 35:56.209
A man like you, Ganzner.
A man like you.

36:05.176 --> 36:08.345
- Anniversary?
- Longest days of the year.

36:08.387 --> 36:11.890
She's the one on the right. Sidra?

36:11.932 --> 36:14.268
Detectives Munch and Stabler.

36:14.310 --> 36:17.228
Hello. This is my friend, Kelli.

36:17.270 --> 36:22.483
And is this... your... licence?

36:22.525 --> 36:24.861
Yes. Thank you.

36:26.154 --> 36:29.365
- How did you lose it?
- On the subway.

36:29.407 --> 36:31.492
Some guy bumped into me.

36:36.913 --> 36:39.457
You don't have to go to this trouble.

36:39.499 --> 36:43.545
You've been on your feet all day.
It's not a problem.

36:43.587 --> 36:48.507
- We're all just civil servants here.
- Please. I'm a subway janitor.

36:48.549 --> 36:52.928
But still, it's a tough job.
When are you due?

36:52.970 --> 36:56.932
Eight or nine weeks. I'm not really sure.

36:56.974 --> 37:01.562
I understand that.
Before my wife and I had our first child,

37:01.603 --> 37:05.189
I always thought nine months,
36 weeks, boom.

37:05.231 --> 37:10.903
But it turns out to be more like ten.
Depending on time of conception.

37:10.945 --> 37:14.115
- It's all a mystery.
- Yes, it is.

37:14.157 --> 37:17.243
Right. But in your case...

37:18.703 --> 37:20.204
My case?

37:21.831 --> 37:27.043
Your situation. You told detectives
a man bumped into you on the subway?

37:27.085 --> 37:29.170
About seven months ago?

37:30.255 --> 37:33.049
- Right.
- And he took your wallet?

37:33.091 --> 37:37.429
I guess so. Oh, I'm so grateful
you got my licence back.

37:37.470 --> 37:41.932
I need it to cash cheques,
even though I don't drive.

37:45.519 --> 37:48.814
What... kind of bump was it?

37:52.526 --> 37:55.903
Uh... it was an accident.

37:59.198 --> 38:03.077
- The car was crowded.
- Were you in uniform?

38:03.119 --> 38:05.204
No, I was off duty.

38:06.205 --> 38:08.291
Were you wearing a dress?

38:10.251 --> 38:15.463
Yes. Why are you asking me
these questions?

38:18.591 --> 38:21.719
- You know about the subway rapist?
- Yes.

38:21.761 --> 38:25.515
- Know how much damage he's done?
- Not to me.

38:25.557 --> 38:29.893
OK, it's just we need your help.
We really do, Sidra.

38:38.819 --> 38:40.612
OK.

38:40.654 --> 38:44.074
Is the man that bumped into you
one of these men?

38:51.706 --> 38:53.791
- He's that man.
- OK.

38:54.875 --> 38:58.462
OK. Thank you very much, Sidra.
Are you hungry?

38:58.504 --> 39:02.924
We don't have ice cream and pickles,
but there is a machine.

39:02.966 --> 39:05.343
Detective Stabler can take you.

39:05.385 --> 39:08.888
Take my arm. Not my hand,
cos I'm working on a cold.

39:12.183 --> 39:16.229
OK. We'll go straight down to the left.

39:17.730 --> 39:22.734
- It's enough to pick him up, but...
- She won't say rape, no conviction.

39:22.776 --> 39:24.861
Then get him to say it.

39:28.490 --> 39:30.701
- Can I have some coffee?
- No.

39:30.742 --> 39:35.622
I have a court order to perform
an amniocentesis on a witness.

39:35.664 --> 39:39.667
- Jane Doe number eight.
- Amnio? For pregnant ladies?

39:39.708 --> 39:43.295
Stick a needle into the womb,
get DNA from the unborn child.

39:43.337 --> 39:44.839
Which we know is yours.

39:44.880 --> 39:47.132
- You do?
- Yep.

39:47.174 --> 39:49.885
This is some kind of bluff, right?

39:50.511 --> 39:52.805
Read it. It's technical, but it means

39:52.846 --> 39:56.266
you were on that train
and you lifted up women's skirts.

39:56.307 --> 40:00.561
- The women who ID'd you, you got lucky.
- But the eighth woman?

40:00.603 --> 40:03.064
Bad luck. You knocked her up.

40:08.778 --> 40:12.197
- Sidra, you feeling OK?
- Fine.

40:12.239 --> 40:15.575
Funny, so am I.
I've had a cold for a week.

40:15.617 --> 40:19.621
You touched my hand, now it's gone.
Can you explain that?

40:19.663 --> 40:22.666
- No.
- Neither can I.

40:22.707 --> 40:26.211
- You'll get fed!
- But I haven't had anything...

40:27.878 --> 40:31.465
- You! Is it you?
- Wait, wait, wait, wait...

40:32.508 --> 40:34.260
It is!

40:35.970 --> 40:38.055
- It's me.
- Yeah.

40:38.097 --> 40:42.059
The girl in the flowered dress?
Tulips? Red and yellow?

40:42.101 --> 40:46.854
They said you were number eight.
I wondered what happened because...

40:46.896 --> 40:49.524
Because what, Sal?

40:49.565 --> 40:55.696
Because I knew that... when I did you,
that something beautiful could happen.

40:55.738 --> 41:00.534
Yeah... That you'd get pregnant
and have my baby.

41:00.575 --> 41:02.953
- My baby...
- Let's go.

41:02.994 --> 41:08.458
When I get out, we'll be together.
A family. A family. It's my baby.

41:08.500 --> 41:10.585
It's my baby!

41:11.305 --> 41:17.307
