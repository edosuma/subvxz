WEBVTT

00:40.623 --> 00:41.624
[computer beeps]

00:43.877 --> 00:46.504
[sighs] Well, this is a first.

00:46.588 --> 00:49.424
[Echo] Inspecting every corner of the ship
finally tired her out.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.386
Yeah, she's curious. I'll give her that.

00:54.137 --> 00:57.557
[sighs] Hunter, she's a child.
What are we gonna do with her?

00:59.851 --> 01:01.436
[Tech] We are coming up on Saleucami.

01:11.946 --> 01:14.449
[squawking]

01:16.076 --> 01:18.536
[growling]

01:18.620 --> 01:19.788
[squawks]

01:43.520 --> 01:46.523
[birds chirping]

01:54.906 --> 01:55.907
Hmm?

01:56.866 --> 01:57.867
What's with her?

01:58.410 --> 01:59.619
[inhales deeply]

02:00.370 --> 02:01.621
[exhales]

02:10.797 --> 02:12.757
Whoa.

02:12.841 --> 02:14.843
What is this?

02:15.802 --> 02:17.429
[Tech] That would be dirt.

02:18.263 --> 02:21.433
[gasps] It's amazing.

02:25.562 --> 02:27.022
[laughs]

02:37.490 --> 02:38.742
[Hunter] Come on. Let's get moving.

02:42.537 --> 02:44.164
[squawking]

02:53.840 --> 02:55.175
Whoa.

03:01.097 --> 03:02.098
Huh?

03:05.268 --> 03:06.811
[chuckles]

03:07.437 --> 03:11.232
So this friend of yours,
what's he doing all the way out here?

03:11.733 --> 03:14.486
Hiding. That's what deserters do.

03:14.569 --> 03:18.907
Staying off the radar's not our specialty,
but he's been doing it for years.

03:18.990 --> 03:21.368
And you trust a deserter?

03:21.868 --> 03:24.329
Why not? We're all deserters now.

03:33.755 --> 03:34.839
What are we looking at?

03:34.923 --> 03:36.132
A booby trap.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.717
Single trip wire.

03:37.801 --> 03:39.594
[chuckles] That's cute.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.389
Whoa! [screams]

03:42.472 --> 03:43.390
Easy, Wrecker!

03:44.891 --> 03:45.892
Was that me?

03:48.520 --> 03:50.605
[Suu] What do we have here?

03:51.481 --> 03:54.234
More clones who have lost their way.

03:55.276 --> 03:57.529
It's been a while, fellas.

04:06.454 --> 04:08.540
I see a few new faces.

04:09.040 --> 04:12.043
Echo and Omega, Cut and Suu.

04:12.127 --> 04:13.878
Pleased to meet you.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.088
Ma'am.

04:16.214 --> 04:17.674
Where's Crosshair?

04:19.009 --> 04:20.927
It's complicated.

04:21.011 --> 04:23.179
Sounds familiar.

04:23.263 --> 04:26.307
Rex told us about the clone troopers
turning against the Jedi.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.184
You talked to Rex? When?

04:28.977 --> 04:30.687
Well, he passed through yesterday.

04:31.354 --> 04:32.272
Where'd he go?

04:32.355 --> 04:33.857
Didn't ask.

04:33.940 --> 04:36.609
He was going on
about some behavioral implant.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.029
He must mean the inhibitor chip.

04:39.529 --> 04:40.530
The what?

04:41.197 --> 04:42.449
Inhibitor chips.

04:42.532 --> 04:45.577
The Kaminoans implanted them
in the clones to modify their behavior.

04:46.161 --> 04:50.165
Tech, you said the regs were programmed
but you never mentioned a chip.

04:50.248 --> 04:51.833
How else did you think it worked?

04:53.084 --> 04:54.085
Mom, Dad!

04:55.086 --> 04:56.838
There's a ship outside!

04:56.921 --> 04:59.924
Shaeeah, Jek! Remember me?

05:00.008 --> 05:01.718
-Uncle Wrecker!
-Uncle Wrecker!

05:04.304 --> 05:05.513
Who are you?

05:07.182 --> 05:08.516
Omega.

05:09.184 --> 05:11.227
We never see kids around here.

05:12.771 --> 05:13.688
Come with us.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.920
[squawking]

05:39.464 --> 05:42.300
Mm... what's the purpose of this?

05:42.384 --> 05:45.428
To have fun. Here, you try.

05:45.512 --> 05:46.513
Huh?

05:49.182 --> 05:52.102
You're supposed to catch it.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.186
Oh.

05:55.397 --> 05:58.900
All right, out with it.
What's with the girl?

05:58.983 --> 06:02.404
She's a defective clone, like we are.

06:02.946 --> 06:04.572
Not exactly.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.116
What do you mean?

06:06.199 --> 06:08.952
The Kaminoans don't create
without a purpose.

06:09.035 --> 06:12.580
You all have one, so what's hers?

06:13.331 --> 06:15.917
It doesn't matter. She's just a kid.

06:16.001 --> 06:20.005
Mm. Battling droids was easy
compared to raising a child.

06:20.088 --> 06:22.090
[chuckling]

06:22.173 --> 06:24.759
You have no idea what you're in for.

06:24.843 --> 06:28.179
We didn't have a choice.
Kamino wasn't safe anymore.

06:28.263 --> 06:30.223
Well, neither is Saleucami.

06:30.306 --> 06:32.851
Rex warned us of the storm that's coming.

06:32.934 --> 06:35.812
Clone troopers have already started
showing up.

06:35.895 --> 06:38.565
I'm heading into town to book us
a transport off-world.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.859
We can take you where you need to go.

06:40.942 --> 06:44.279
Nah, you're wanted men. It's too risky.

06:44.362 --> 06:46.448
I have to do what's best for them.

06:49.159 --> 06:52.037
[Shaeeah laughing]

06:52.120 --> 06:53.246
I caught it!

07:02.797 --> 07:04.174
[droid beeps, whistles]

07:05.133 --> 07:07.844
[chattering]

07:07.927 --> 07:12.640
Troops should be pulling their forces,
not securing a post. The war is over.

07:12.724 --> 07:15.310
[chuckles] Well, it doesn't feel that way.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.937
[PA: indistinct]

07:32.077 --> 07:34.329
They started seizing ships
about a week ago.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.331
Military ships?

07:36.414 --> 07:37.999
All ships.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.085
They're tagging them
inside that impound lot.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.253
The stall's up ahead.

07:42.337 --> 07:44.589
Let's book the shuttle
before we're spotted.

07:48.009 --> 07:50.637
So, where will you
and your family go next?

07:51.930 --> 07:55.308
I suppose find a remote piece of land
on a distant planet.

07:55.392 --> 07:56.726
That's all we really need.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.106
That's the key to not being found?

08:02.190 --> 08:04.192
You wanna know how to disappear?

08:04.275 --> 08:07.696
Put being a soldier behind you
and make a new life for yourself.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.073
What do you want?

08:11.700 --> 08:14.661
I need to book passage
on the next shuttle out of here.

08:15.328 --> 08:19.416
Those credits won't do you any good
without a chain code.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.793
New galactic policy.

08:21.876 --> 08:22.794
My what?

08:23.420 --> 08:26.089
[sighs] Your chain code.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.008
[PA: admiral]
<i>...your individual chain code,</i>

08:28.091 --> 08:33.096
<i>every citizen can exchange their</i>
<i>invalid currency for Imperial credits,</i>

08:33.179 --> 08:36.516
<i>thanks to the generosity</i>
<i>of the new Galactic Empire.</i>

08:37.225 --> 08:39.310
<i>The war is over.</i>

08:39.394 --> 08:42.814
<i>With peace comes opportunity</i>
<i>and prosperity for all.</i>

08:44.315 --> 08:46.401
[male passenger grunting]

08:46.484 --> 08:48.945
I booked passage on this transport.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.740
No planetary travel without a chain code.

08:51.823 --> 08:54.117
But I have to get on this ship.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.785
Stand down, citizen.

08:55.869 --> 08:59.456
Get in line, get your chain code,
and don't make any trouble.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.791
It's not just ships.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.960
They're registering people too.

09:04.711 --> 09:07.839
[sighs] Getting off-planet's
gonna be harder than I thought.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.092
[animal squawks]

09:11.176 --> 09:12.594
Nice one.

09:17.474 --> 09:18.767
I'll get it.

09:18.850 --> 09:21.227
It's past the fence. We'll get it later.

09:21.311 --> 09:22.145
Jek!

09:31.654 --> 09:34.324
Come inside. We have to finish packing.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.784
But it's still early.

09:35.867 --> 09:38.036
Inside, now.

09:38.745 --> 09:39.954
Where's Omega?

09:40.038 --> 09:41.706
She was right behind me.

09:51.299 --> 09:52.384
[Shaeeah] Omega!

09:53.385 --> 09:54.511
Got it!

09:54.594 --> 09:57.555
[Shaeeah] Omega, don't move!

09:59.933 --> 10:02.435
[growling]

10:04.062 --> 10:05.063
[beeping]

10:05.146 --> 10:10.276
Hmm. It appears all public transport
is now restricted without chain codes.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.153
Which Cut can't sign up for.

10:12.237 --> 10:14.614
He'll be arrested when they discover
he's a deserter.

10:14.698 --> 10:16.491
The next shuttle leaves in a few hours.

10:17.283 --> 10:20.370
Codes or no codes, we need to be on it.

10:20.453 --> 10:21.329
[Shaeeah] Mom!

10:22.038 --> 10:23.998
Mom, it's Omega!

10:24.082 --> 10:25.917
She went out past the fence!

10:29.462 --> 10:32.841
[creature growling]

10:34.092 --> 10:35.510
[hisses]

10:39.347 --> 10:40.849
[growling continues]

10:41.391 --> 10:42.392
[whimpers]

10:43.977 --> 10:46.396
[growls, winces]

10:47.689 --> 10:50.442
[growling]

10:58.450 --> 11:00.035
What were you doing out there?

11:00.118 --> 11:02.287
Do you realize you could've been killed?

11:03.580 --> 11:06.833
Easy. She's not a soldier.

11:08.335 --> 11:11.838
Are you hurt? Now, let's take a look here.

11:12.547 --> 11:16.134
I'm sorry. I was trying to get the ball.

11:16.217 --> 11:17.218
I didn't know.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.515
You're safe. That's all that matters.

11:23.433 --> 11:24.351
Come on.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.606
Hey, kid. You all right?

11:31.274 --> 11:32.859
She'll be fine.

11:37.364 --> 11:40.533
All in all,
I would say that could've gone much worse.

11:41.743 --> 11:44.496
Tech, you think you could forge
some chain codes?

11:44.579 --> 11:47.499
I only learned of them moments ago,
but yes.

11:47.582 --> 11:51.503
Do it. We're getting Cut,
Suu and the kids on that shuttle.

12:16.861 --> 12:17.862
[sniffles]

12:22.409 --> 12:24.369
[sighs]

12:30.125 --> 12:31.876
Need another set of eyes out here?

12:31.960 --> 12:34.212
Almost forgot how good of a shot you are.

12:34.963 --> 12:36.756
I owe you one.

12:36.840 --> 12:40.093
Children will always find ways
of getting into trouble, Hunter.

12:40.176 --> 12:41.803
It's what they do.

12:41.886 --> 12:44.139
Protecting them is what we do.

12:46.391 --> 12:47.559
Where's Omega?

12:48.351 --> 12:49.936
She wanted to stay on the ship.

12:51.271 --> 12:54.274
I've been thinking about what you said.

12:55.191 --> 12:58.028
And you're right, she's not a soldier.

12:58.695 --> 12:59.863
Just give her some time.

13:01.364 --> 13:04.951
When you leave Saleucami,
I want Omega to go with you.

13:05.035 --> 13:08.413
You two can give her something
that we can't.

13:09.372 --> 13:10.874
Is that what you really want?

13:11.958 --> 13:13.793
It's what she needs.

13:18.298 --> 13:22.010
It's ironic. Clones wanted names
instead of numbers,

13:22.093 --> 13:25.180
yet now people are signing up
to be given numbers.

13:25.263 --> 13:27.223
It's ingenious.

13:27.307 --> 13:30.602
You could create a database
to identify anyone in the galaxy.

13:30.685 --> 13:32.645
Glad you're impressed,

13:32.729 --> 13:37.442
but where are we going to find the data
for these chain codes? And the disks?

13:37.525 --> 13:39.319
Already thought of that.

13:39.402 --> 13:41.571
Clones now control the spaceport.

13:41.654 --> 13:44.532
There we can tap into their network
and replicate the codes.

13:44.616 --> 13:45.575
Then what?

13:45.658 --> 13:48.995
Hunter said they're tagging ships
inside their impound facility.

13:49.079 --> 13:50.580
That is our way in.

13:50.663 --> 13:54.417
You're suggesting we call the authorities
and have them seize our ship?

13:54.959 --> 13:56.670
That is exactly what I am saying.

13:56.753 --> 14:01.508
I guess if they think it's abandoned,
that just might work.

14:05.637 --> 14:07.013
You did what?

14:16.773 --> 14:17.857
Tech!

14:17.941 --> 14:19.693
<i>This was the simplest solution.</i>

14:19.776 --> 14:22.987
Getting our ship impounded is not my idea
of a solution.

14:23.071 --> 14:25.699
We'll meet you at the spaceport
with the chain codes.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.325
I have this under control.

14:27.409 --> 14:31.413
[Hunter] <i>There's one big problem.</i>
<i>Omega's on the ship.</i>

14:34.708 --> 14:36.710
I think it's a good plan, Tech.

14:37.293 --> 14:39.129
So much for simple.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.224
[clone trooper 1]
Clamp it down and add it to the list.

14:51.307 --> 14:52.809
We'll run its signature later.

14:57.856 --> 15:00.150
What kind of ship is this anyway?

15:00.233 --> 15:03.319
[clone trooper 2] Looks like
a modified <i>Omicron</i>-class attack shuttle.

15:06.614 --> 15:09.617
[clone trooper 1]
It's a mess. No wonder it was abandoned.

15:22.714 --> 15:23.631
So far so good.

15:24.549 --> 15:26.384
Now how can I help?

15:26.468 --> 15:30.263
[Echo] You've had enough action for today.
We'll handle this.

15:33.892 --> 15:35.685
[Tech] Go to the security kiosk.

15:35.769 --> 15:39.689
Scomp in, copy the data and grab
the blank disks for me to program.

15:39.773 --> 15:40.690
[Echo] Roger that.

15:43.568 --> 15:45.862
[droid beeping]

16:18.395 --> 16:19.938
I don't see any disks, Tech.

16:20.021 --> 16:22.190
<i>They'll be locked in a safe compartment.</i>

16:33.326 --> 16:34.703
Ah. Found 'em.

16:34.786 --> 16:36.037
<i>Excellent.</i>

17:01.479 --> 17:03.940
Tech, we're in the spaceport.
What is your status?

17:07.902 --> 17:10.989
In progress.
The encryption shouldn't be a problem.

17:24.294 --> 17:26.755
Mom, I don't like this.

17:26.838 --> 17:28.465
Everything will be okay.

17:32.510 --> 17:35.430
Hurry up. We need those chain codes
to get them on the shuttle,

17:35.513 --> 17:37.640
or we're going to have to blast our way
out of here.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.144
Don't worry.

17:41.227 --> 17:44.981
I can slip through security unnoticed
and deliver the disks to you momentarily.

17:45.648 --> 17:46.649
[alert sounds]

17:46.733 --> 17:49.736
[comms chatter]

17:58.161 --> 18:00.830
[Echo] No chance you're getting
past all them undetected.

18:00.914 --> 18:02.749
[Tech] We can't get caught
with these chain codes.

18:02.832 --> 18:05.502
We can't get caught at all.
What are you talking about?

18:05.585 --> 18:09.130
If we get tied up in a blaster fight,
they're gonna lock down the whole port.

18:11.174 --> 18:13.677
Where'd the disks go? And where's Omega?

18:16.304 --> 18:17.263
Found her.

18:21.851 --> 18:25.689
[Echo] This great plan of yours
is looking really lousy about now.

18:36.533 --> 18:38.952
Have your chain codes out
and ready for inspection.

18:43.707 --> 18:46.084
[Tech] <i>The chain codes are en route...</i>
<i>with Omega.</i>

18:46.167 --> 18:49.421
By herself? You let her go by herself?

18:49.504 --> 18:52.048
-<i>Well, we didn't let her go.</i>
-I'm on it.

18:52.132 --> 18:53.842
<i>She ran off on her own.</i>

18:53.925 --> 18:55.427
If something happens to her--

18:55.510 --> 18:58.555
Like I said, kids always find trouble.

18:59.931 --> 19:03.309
[Tech] <i>What is taking so long with</i>
<i>the boot? Are you trying to get caught?</i>

19:03.393 --> 19:06.396
I'm doing my best.
You wanna come out here and give it a try?

19:06.479 --> 19:09.357
Hey, who are you? You don't belong here.

19:09.441 --> 19:12.318
I'm the maintenance tech.

19:14.779 --> 19:16.114
I've got a situation at bay--

19:23.538 --> 19:24.998
[Tech] That is not ideal.

19:25.081 --> 19:26.541
[Echo] We're in agreement on that one.

19:32.839 --> 19:33.882
[chirping]

19:35.258 --> 19:37.844
[beeps, wailing]

19:37.927 --> 19:39.554
No! Don't do that.

19:44.184 --> 19:45.143
That hit the spot!

19:48.146 --> 19:50.398
[Echo]
<i>Wrecker, we could use some help over here.</i>

19:50.482 --> 19:51.608
On my way.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.194
They're waiting for you at the dock.
Better get going.

20:00.992 --> 20:03.578
Halt. Where are you going?

20:03.661 --> 20:04.996
Uh...

20:05.080 --> 20:06.873
Show me your chain code, citizen.

20:06.956 --> 20:09.459
Sure. I got it right here.

20:09.542 --> 20:12.379
Oh, right, must be in this hand.

20:18.176 --> 20:21.221
A couple of locals with blasters
got past the barrier.

20:21.304 --> 20:23.223
[clone trooper] Next. Step forward.

20:24.641 --> 20:26.267
We're running out of time, Hunter.

20:28.436 --> 20:30.230
Omega's on her way.

20:32.774 --> 20:36.194
No, something's wrong.
She should've been here by now.

20:36.277 --> 20:38.446
Stick to the plan, Cut.

20:44.703 --> 20:46.496
[clone trooper]
Let me see your identification.

20:49.541 --> 20:51.543
-I can't risk it.
-[clone trooper] All right, move along.

20:51.626 --> 20:53.086
We have to find another way out.

20:53.169 --> 20:54.170
[Omega] I'm here.

20:55.922 --> 20:59.175
-[whispering] And I have the chain codes.
-[quiet] Yeah, Omega!

20:59.259 --> 21:02.345
Tech accidentally made five disks
instead of four.

21:02.429 --> 21:04.097
You didn't tell her?

21:04.180 --> 21:05.348
Tell me what?

21:08.101 --> 21:09.310
[clone trooper] Keep moving.

21:18.695 --> 21:23.074
The extra chain code's for you,
so you can leave with Cut and Suu.

21:23.158 --> 21:24.492
Why?

21:24.576 --> 21:27.370
Did I do something wrong?

21:28.121 --> 21:29.873
You need a family, kid.

21:29.956 --> 21:33.043
They're good people.
They'll give you the life you deserve.

21:36.838 --> 21:40.717
But... I want to stay with you.

21:42.761 --> 21:44.304
[clone trooper] Quit holding up the line.

21:44.804 --> 21:49.225
You have to go, Omega.
It's for your own good.

22:11.664 --> 22:12.665
[device beeps]

22:32.060 --> 22:33.061
[device beeps]

22:40.110 --> 22:42.112
[device beeping]

22:42.195 --> 22:43.947
You're clear. Go on through.

22:58.545 --> 23:02.090
[Tech] <i>Hunter, we have worn out</i>
<i>our welcome. We need to go right now.</i>

23:02.173 --> 23:03.258
On my way.

23:08.013 --> 23:09.014
Ready?

23:21.568 --> 23:22.777
-[shouts]
-[screams]

23:23.903 --> 23:25.155
[grunting]

23:29.075 --> 23:30.493
[grunts]

23:39.419 --> 23:41.004
[Tech] Glad you could make it.

23:42.505 --> 23:43.631
What are we waiting for?

23:43.715 --> 23:46.593
The clamp's still magnetized.
The system's not responding.

23:50.680 --> 23:51.681
Move.

23:57.520 --> 23:58.646
[grunts]

24:00.690 --> 24:02.442
It responded to that.

24:03.360 --> 24:04.361
Let's go.

24:09.491 --> 24:10.950
Wait. Omega's not back.

24:11.451 --> 24:13.661
-Wrecker, she's not--
-[Omega] Wait for me!

24:18.083 --> 24:19.376
[grunting]

24:31.846 --> 24:34.099
Is there a problem?

24:34.933 --> 24:36.059
You look like--

24:36.142 --> 24:38.353
They need reinforcements
at the impound dock.

24:40.021 --> 24:41.147
Carry on.

25:25.650 --> 25:27.235
[droid honking]

25:47.005 --> 25:51.968
I know I made a mistake,
and I have a lot to learn,

25:52.677 --> 25:54.804
but you don't have to get rid of me.

25:54.888 --> 25:57.098
I left Kamino with you.

25:58.391 --> 26:00.143
This is where I wanna be.

26:01.311 --> 26:05.398
Tell you the truth, kid,
I guess I've got a lot to learn too.

26:07.984 --> 26:13.531
If this is where you want to be,
then this is where you'll stay.
