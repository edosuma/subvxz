Can we just bury him
in the backyard

03:38.586 --> 03:40.519
and tell my parents
we lost him trick-or-treating?

Oh, absolutely not.

04:25.398 --> 04:26.898
Why?

04:26.900 --> 04:29.434
Why? Because God knows
what's on this, that's why.

04:29.436 --> 04:30.435
Only one way
to find out.

04:32.505 --> 04:34.573
Timmy, you're
not watching it.
Yes I am.

04:34.575 --> 04:35.741
Timmy, stop being
such an asshole.

04:36.309 --> 04:39.411
Hey! I said no.

04:39.413 --> 04:41.813
It's my tape, I can do
what I want with it.

04:41.815 --> 04:44.483

of you and you have
to listen to me.

04:44.485 --> 04:46.718

in your bag.

you can turn it off.
We won't tell our parents.
