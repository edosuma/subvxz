WEBVTT

01:09.653 --> 01:11.196
Turn around. Hands up!

01:29.423 --> 01:30.591
Well, well.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.719
Just as I suspected.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.847
Kind of obvious
when you think about it, huh?

01:37.639 --> 01:40.809
No for me, boss. I no see that coming.

01:40.893 --> 01:44.062
Anyone with an alibi
is always a suspect, Markowitz.

01:44.146 --> 01:46.273
How do you know these things, jefe?

01:53.488 --> 01:55.741
Wait. I'm the sidekick?

01:55.824 --> 01:58.118
Yes. You're the sidekick.

01:58.785 --> 02:01.121
Thank you so much.
I don't know what to say.

02:01.205 --> 02:04.791
You're welcome.
Now, should we go back to the top?

02:05.876 --> 02:07.211
Yeah? Okay.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.463
Well, well.

02:09.544 --> 02:11.215
Just as I suspected.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.008
Kind of obvious when--

02:13.091 --> 02:14.510
Why the accents?

02:14.593 --> 02:16.136
You're Puerto Rican.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.848
Hey. Not bad.

02:19.932 --> 02:22.267
There you go. Okay.

02:23.769 --> 02:24.770
Well, well.

02:25.395 --> 02:27.064
Just as I suspected.

02:27.731 --> 02:30.984
He watched the light fade
from the man's eyes,

02:32.152 --> 02:35.614
the withdrawing of the life-force
from the body

02:35.697 --> 02:38.534
seeming to coincide

02:39.368 --> 02:43.205
with the evacuation of his bowels
into his gabardine slacks.

02:43.288 --> 02:45.332
"…into his gabardine slacks."

02:46.375 --> 02:47.459
Before long…

02:48.043 --> 02:49.044
"Before long…"

02:49.127 --> 02:52.840
-…the putrid scent of feces…
-"…the putrid scent of feces…"

02:52.923 --> 02:54.424
…hung in the air like…

02:55.551 --> 02:57.511
the ghost of a dead lover.

02:57.594 --> 03:01.640
"…hung in the air
like the ghost of a dead lover."

03:01.723 --> 03:02.808
You getting this, Marty?

03:02.891 --> 03:05.936
You know, you gotta keep up
with the rhythm of the prose.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.271
You know, it's like jazz.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.273
-Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah?

03:09.356 --> 03:11.358
I got it. I got it. Got it.

03:13.569 --> 03:17.114
"Another day, another dollar,"
as he always said.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.408
"…another dollar…"

03:19.491 --> 03:21.618
He turned on his heel and walked out.

03:21.702 --> 03:22.828
Another day,

03:23.412 --> 03:27.124
-another case closed.
-"Another day… Case closed."

03:28.625 --> 03:29.626
The end.

03:30.460 --> 03:31.461
"The end."

03:31.962 --> 03:32.963
Or is it?

03:34.631 --> 03:35.632
Isn't it?

03:37.384 --> 03:38.802
Just saying that,

03:40.012 --> 03:42.806
maybe Dr. Kessler
isn't as dead as he seemed.

03:43.932 --> 03:46.101
Wow. No way.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.438
-I love it.
-Well, there we go.

03:51.148 --> 03:54.359
Book nine of the "Some Like It" series
complete.

03:55.777 --> 03:56.778
Incredible.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.573
And ship all of this to the publisher?

03:59.656 --> 04:02.201
I think so, yeah.
I think it reads better as a series.

04:02.284 --> 04:05.204
But it's this last book
that's gonna really get them interested.

04:05.287 --> 04:06.747
-Yeah.
-It's the ultimate page-turner.

04:07.331 --> 04:09.791
Bottom line, though, it's gonna sell.

04:09.875 --> 04:12.461
And at the end of the day,
that's all the publishers care about.

04:12.544 --> 04:13.795
Getting noses in books.

04:15.631 --> 04:16.632
Ouch.

04:17.673 --> 04:19.718
My stomach kinda hurts when I do that.

04:19.801 --> 04:22.012
Yeah, well, you know what?
My head really hurts when I do this.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.597
I just wrote an entire novel.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.724
But this has been going on
for a couple of weeks now.

04:25.807 --> 04:28.185
Well,
maybe your stomach problems are back.

04:29.144 --> 04:30.479
It-- It feels different.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.899
It sounds weird, but I can't fart,
you know?

04:33.982 --> 04:35.567
Even though it feels like I need to.

04:36.318 --> 04:40.197
And then if I cough, it feels like
I might, you know, poop by mistake.

04:40.280 --> 04:43.408
Okay. Yeah. That's too much information.

04:43.492 --> 04:44.493
Thank you.

05:16.358 --> 05:18.402
Marty, are you okay?

05:19.152 --> 05:22.281
I just have a little bit of discomfort
when I move.

05:22.364 --> 05:23.949
Or don't move.

05:24.867 --> 05:25.909
Or breathe.

05:25.993 --> 05:29.246
That doesn't sound so good.
Sit down. I'll get you some water.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.331
No. No, no, no. I can't. We're too busy.

05:31.415 --> 05:33.542
You weren't too busy
to have a heart attack.

05:33.625 --> 05:35.002
You scared us once before.

05:35.085 --> 05:37.254
You think I'm gonna let you do that again?
Sit.

05:40.966 --> 05:44.553
Hey, listen.
I know this probably isn't the best time,

05:44.636 --> 05:46.763
but I was wondering
if I could get a word with you

05:46.847 --> 05:50.225
about some financial stuff.

05:51.101 --> 05:54.396
Bruce, can you just
email Norman Horowitz about it?

05:54.479 --> 05:56.315
Well, it's kinda urgent.

05:56.398 --> 06:00.110
And I figured it's easier to talk to you
because you're right here.

06:00.194 --> 06:01.195
What's up, Bruce?

06:04.239 --> 06:05.449
I was just…

06:06.700 --> 06:08.243
That's okay. We can talk later.

06:09.286 --> 06:10.287
Problem?

06:12.664 --> 06:15.042
No, no. No problem.

06:16.502 --> 06:18.504
It kind of sounds like there is.

06:19.213 --> 06:21.590
Come on, Bruce. You can say anything.

06:23.926 --> 06:26.762
I was having a look
at this year's accounts

06:26.845 --> 06:29.097
on top of this year's expenses, and…

06:31.767 --> 06:32.768
we have a big problem.

06:32.851 --> 06:36.563
We don't use the word "problem" at AFC.
We use the word "solution."

06:36.647 --> 06:40.651
Yeah, but sometimes you need to know
the problem in order to find the solution.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.611
Okay, thank you, Cathy. That'll be enough.

06:42.694 --> 06:46.740
Our problem is that profits are down
and midtown rents are up.

06:47.282 --> 06:49.743
-Yeah. We can't afford the lease here.
-Okay, you know what?

06:49.826 --> 06:51.578
This sounds like something
for Norman Horowitz.

06:51.662 --> 06:53.705
Yeah. I gotta be honest.
It's killing us. Right?

06:53.789 --> 06:56.542
Another six months of this rent,
we go under. Simple as that.

06:56.625 --> 06:58.836
All right, you know what?
All I hear is the word "problem."

06:58.919 --> 07:00.420
But he has a solution.

07:00.504 --> 07:04.049
Okay.
Well, lead with that next time, please.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.718
A contact of mine tipped me off
that the Lea & Perrins factory

07:06.802 --> 07:08.887
in Fair Lawn, New Jersey is empty.

07:08.971 --> 07:10.180
Now, we could move out of here,

07:10.264 --> 07:12.558
rent that place for, like,
under half the price.

07:12.641 --> 07:14.685
It's twice the size,
but we'd have to move quick.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.979
-That place is gonna go fast.
-No.

07:17.062 --> 07:19.231
Forget it, Bruce.
We're not moving to New Jersey.

07:20.023 --> 07:21.400
This is a great opportunity.

07:21.483 --> 07:25.529
You know, when I encouraged
more feedback from the workforce,

07:25.612 --> 07:28.740
I was expecting suggestions
more along the lines of

07:28.824 --> 07:31.076
"Could we get some non-dairy creamer
for the coffee cart?"

07:31.159 --> 07:32.160
Not, "Hey, I've got an idea.

07:32.244 --> 07:34.162
Why don't we tank our business
and move to New Jersey?"

07:34.246 --> 07:38.208
-But the problem is that we can't--
-You don't take AFC out of Manhattan.

07:38.292 --> 07:40.085
It's classy. It's classic.

07:40.169 --> 07:43.213
New Jersey is second-rate. It's cheap.

07:43.297 --> 07:46.633
Do you think that the pastrami from
Katz's Deli tastes the same in New Jersey?

07:46.717 --> 07:49.678
-Yes.
-I think that it probably would, yeah.

07:50.345 --> 07:51.972
No, incorrect. It doesn't.

07:52.556 --> 07:56.977
Moving, in itself, Bruce,
is expensive. So…

07:57.060 --> 08:00.105
Look, Bruce,
business is all about perception.

08:00.189 --> 08:04.234
If we were to pack up and move out
to some sauce factory in New Jersey

08:04.318 --> 08:06.778
with our schmekel between our legs,
that sends a message.

08:06.862 --> 08:10.407
It sends a message to our customers
as well as our competition.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.869
And that message is,
"Hey, look at us. We're losers."

08:13.952 --> 08:15.913
Now, you wanna make a suggestion?

08:15.996 --> 08:18.790
Maybe we should try moving to a place
that's more expensive.

08:18.874 --> 08:20.417
That would be smart.

08:20.501 --> 08:24.338
Now, if all of you financial wizards
would excuse me, I have patients to see.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.965
Thankfully, none of them
are as crazy as Bruce.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.929
Here. Take that.

08:33.597 --> 08:37.183
Listen, I don't wanna cause
any trouble, all right?

08:37.267 --> 08:39.061
But this is a serious situation.

08:40.102 --> 08:42.147
You know I care about this company, Marty.

08:42.231 --> 08:45.442
I was there when your dad
put his sweat and blood into this place.

08:45.526 --> 08:47.736
I feel like I sorta owe it to him
to keep it alive.

08:49.112 --> 08:51.865
I don't know. I mean,
I hear what you're saying, Bruce,

08:51.949 --> 08:54.576
but…
I think we gotta listen to the experts.

08:54.660 --> 08:58.455
You know, it's his world.
He knows what he's talking about.

08:59.915 --> 09:02.960
-It's-- Jesus. See a fricking doctor.
-No.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.587
No, no.
A doctor's only gonna make things worse.

09:05.671 --> 09:08.465
It's like taking your car in.
They're gonna find something eventually.

09:08.549 --> 09:10.592
That is it. I'm making the call.

09:10.676 --> 09:13.637
-No.
-You are not crapping out on me, Marty.

09:13.720 --> 09:17.850
I am not springing for a new dress
for a perfectly avoidable funeral.

09:20.853 --> 09:23.939
You have a hernia.
You will need surgery to repair the tear.

09:24.022 --> 09:27.401
Surgery? Like surgery-surgery?

09:27.484 --> 09:30.112
I'm afraid so, and as soon as possible.

09:30.195 --> 09:33.490
Good news is it's a straightforward
procedure and nothing to worry about.

09:33.574 --> 09:35.242
Well, I guess that is good news.

09:35.325 --> 09:38.036
So, in and out? You know, like, same day?

09:38.120 --> 09:40.247
Not quite. We get in there pretty deep.

09:40.330 --> 09:42.666
We keep you around to make sure
the sutures don't get infected.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.042
Sutures?

09:44.126 --> 09:45.377
You won't feel them.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.838
You'll wake up very comfortable
from the anesthesia.

09:48.881 --> 09:52.301
Anesthesia? What?
Hold on. This doesn't sound so simple.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.430
How long will I be in the hospital?

09:56.513 --> 09:59.057
I have a lot of responsibilities
I need to take care of.

09:59.141 --> 10:00.475
What sort of responsibilities?

10:00.559 --> 10:03.520
Well, you know-- My constituents.

10:03.604 --> 10:04.813
They're counting on me.

10:04.897 --> 10:06.523
You're an elected official?

10:06.607 --> 10:10.944
No,
I don't think I used that word correctly.

10:11.445 --> 10:13.447
People need me to be healthy, is all.

10:13.530 --> 10:15.824
Not long at all.
Should only be a few days.

10:15.908 --> 10:18.911
And then, obviously,
there will be a period of recovery.

10:18.994 --> 10:21.330
A period of recovery?

10:22.623 --> 10:23.916
Oh, my God.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.169
All right, well, I guess I will…

10:27.878 --> 10:29.796
I have to get my affairs in order.

10:29.880 --> 10:33.884
Mr. Markowitz, I assure you,
it's really pretty routine.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.386
We'll get everything popped back in,
and then off you go.

10:38.180 --> 10:40.015
Right. Okay.

10:41.558 --> 10:46.188
I've been thinking, Marty. That whole
thing with Bruce didn't sit well with me.

10:46.271 --> 10:48.023
The Bruce thing? What thing?

10:51.443 --> 10:52.778
A move to Jersey.

10:53.570 --> 10:55.197
I just don't have time for negativity.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.115
It's toxic.

10:57.199 --> 10:58.951
And it's not good for your anxiety.

11:00.911 --> 11:03.121
I don't know. I just think--

11:03.205 --> 11:04.206
You know what?

11:05.499 --> 11:06.834
We're out of time for today.

11:07.793 --> 11:09.586
-Oh, right.
-Yeah.

11:11.380 --> 11:13.632
So… with the koi.

11:13.715 --> 11:17.719
They have this ich parasite problem
with their gills currently,

11:18.220 --> 11:21.431
so they're gonna need
a little more care than usual.

11:21.515 --> 11:24.518
Can I ask you to put
some formalin drops in the pond

11:24.601 --> 11:25.978
as soon as you get down there

11:26.061 --> 11:27.145
-for the weekend?
-Sure.

11:27.229 --> 11:28.522
-Yeah.
-Great.

11:29.106 --> 11:30.774
About the feeding schedule.

11:30.858 --> 11:34.736
I think the long-release block
should be good for a few more days,

11:34.820 --> 11:37.114
but you may wanna add
a precise measured pour

11:37.197 --> 11:40.158
of the spirulina algae as a weekend treat.

11:40.242 --> 11:42.703
Think of it
as their Saturday morning pancakes.

11:43.287 --> 11:44.955
It's all labeled in the guest house.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.456
And also, I wrote it down.

11:46.540 --> 11:47.541
Got it.

11:50.127 --> 11:54.214
And… if I don't make it…

11:56.008 --> 11:59.511
can you just promise me
they'll be taken care of?

11:59.595 --> 12:01.638
Seriously? Come on.

12:01.722 --> 12:04.975
Look, let's not make a huge deal of this,
okay?

12:05.058 --> 12:07.477
It's a hernia. Yeah?
It's like getting your tonsils out.

12:08.020 --> 12:11.023
The girls got their tonsils out
when they were little, and it was fine.

12:11.565 --> 12:14.276
You know, we watched Jungle Book
and we ate ice cream and Jell-O.

12:14.359 --> 12:16.361
You're gonna be great.
You're in very good hands.

12:16.445 --> 12:18.155
And your fish are in good hands too.

12:18.780 --> 12:21.491
I know how much they mean to you,
so they mean just as much to me.

12:22.659 --> 12:23.744
I appreciate that.

12:24.453 --> 12:25.454
Come here.

12:27.998 --> 12:30.209
Is that a hernia
or are you just pleased to see me?

12:32.211 --> 12:33.212
Come on.

12:34.671 --> 12:35.923
I love playing around.

12:37.216 --> 12:38.634
-All right.
-Okay.

12:39.635 --> 12:40.636
Talk soon.

12:43.222 --> 12:46.308
Finally, we just need contact details
for your next of kin.

12:46.391 --> 12:49.144
Just a formality, in case of emergency.

12:49.228 --> 12:53.148
Parents? Wife? Children? Siblings?
Could be anyone.

12:56.860 --> 12:58.779
Ike Herschkopf.

12:59.404 --> 13:04.409
H-E-R-S-C-H-K-O-P-F.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.787
Great. Good luck.

14:02.259 --> 14:03.927
You did great, Marty.

14:11.101 --> 14:12.811
It's okay. You're in recovery.

14:17.733 --> 14:18.734
Okay.

14:40.172 --> 14:42.424
Doctor ordered a CBC.

14:42.508 --> 14:44.551
Need to make sure that your iron levels
have come back up

14:44.635 --> 14:47.054
-and check for any possible infections.
-Okay.

14:47.137 --> 14:48.680
-Got any questions, honey?
-Yes.

14:49.765 --> 14:52.434
-Visiting hours are 9:00 to 5:00, right?
-That's correct.

14:56.104 --> 14:57.397
How you feeling?

14:58.065 --> 14:59.066
You know.

14:59.691 --> 15:00.692
Question.

15:01.193 --> 15:03.946
Does someone have to be approved
before they can come visit?

15:04.029 --> 15:05.948
What exactly is the process?

15:06.031 --> 15:07.866
Is it a written consent?

15:08.450 --> 15:10.536
Oral consent? 'Cause I'm happy to--

15:10.619 --> 15:11.912
I'm gonna up your meds, okay?

15:11.995 --> 15:15.290
No, no, no, 'cause I need to stay awake
in case he comes by.

15:17.668 --> 15:20.254
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

15:20.337 --> 15:23.507
I just need to run through some
of these insurance details with you.

15:23.590 --> 15:27.177
Is there a chance that I wouldn't be
getting cell phone reception in here?

15:27.261 --> 15:29.346
I just wanna make sure
I'm not missing any visitors

15:29.429 --> 15:30.931
who try to get ahold of me.

15:31.014 --> 15:33.600
Can I check your phone?

15:40.107 --> 15:41.108
Okay.

15:42.818 --> 15:45.279
Hello? Dr. Ike?

15:45.946 --> 15:47.281
No, no. You…

15:48.574 --> 15:50.742
No, you have the wrong number. Yeah.

15:52.661 --> 15:54.246
Yeah. No. Okay.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.510
Mr. Markowitz? You have a visitor.

16:09.344 --> 16:10.345
I do?

16:14.641 --> 16:16.059
-Thanks, man.
-You're welcome.

16:18.395 --> 16:19.730
Good afternoon, sir.

16:19.813 --> 16:22.900
My friends and I
are reading to seniors today.

16:22.983 --> 16:25.194
Would-- Would you like me to read to you?

16:30.115 --> 16:32.868
"I seen it over and over.

16:32.951 --> 16:36.997
A guy talkin' to another guy
and it don't make no difference

16:37.080 --> 16:40.876
if he don't hear or understand.

16:40.959 --> 16:45.672
The thing is, they're talkin'
or they're settling still not talking.

16:45.756 --> 16:48.217
It's just bein' with another guy."

16:48.300 --> 16:50.135
Why are you here, Terrel?

16:52.054 --> 16:54.640
You don't actually care about me, do you?

16:57.684 --> 17:01.063
No. You're okay. You're cool.

17:02.147 --> 17:03.732
-I'm cool?
-Yeah.

17:03.815 --> 17:04.816
No.

17:05.442 --> 17:06.568
I'm not cool.

17:07.236 --> 17:08.529
Why are you really here?

17:11.240 --> 17:14.326
Honestly, I just need some stuff
to put on my college app.

17:15.367 --> 17:18.163
It was either this or band,
and I hate band, so…

17:18.247 --> 17:19.915
Everyone hates band.

17:24.502 --> 17:27.256
Well, at least you're honest.

17:27.339 --> 17:28.549
Don't ever lose that.

17:32.344 --> 17:33.345
So…

17:34.263 --> 17:36.598
do you want me to keep reading, sir, or…

17:38.475 --> 17:40.978
You know what? Yeah. Why not?

17:41.061 --> 17:42.271
Thanks, Terrel.

17:45.983 --> 17:48.777
"Sure, you could play horseshoes
till it got dark,

17:49.403 --> 17:50.863
but then you got to read books.

17:50.946 --> 17:52.197
Books ain't no good.

17:52.948 --> 17:55.784
A guy needs somebody to be near him.

17:56.493 --> 17:58.412
A guy goes nuts if he ain't got nobody.

17:59.204 --> 18:02.833
Don't make no difference who the guy is,
long as he's with you.

18:03.500 --> 18:07.045
I tell ya, a guy gets too lonely
an' he gets sick."

18:07.129 --> 18:08.922
You can stop there, Terrel.

18:10.257 --> 18:11.341
Thank you.

18:45.459 --> 18:46.710
Mr. Markowitz?

18:48.420 --> 18:49.546
Mr. Markowitz.

18:50.464 --> 18:52.007
You can't leave.

18:52.090 --> 18:54.468
Come back here. Sir.

18:58.764 --> 19:02.142
What do you think you're doing?
Mr. Markowitz!

19:05.103 --> 19:06.104
Fuck.

19:48.647 --> 19:49.982
Everybody, duck!

19:50.566 --> 19:52.818
-Don't say it. Don't even think it.
-What?

19:52.901 --> 19:55.320
-I'm not playing golf with you again.
-Why not?

19:55.404 --> 19:57.823
"Why not?" That wasn't golf.
That was more like hockey.

19:57.906 --> 19:59.324
I was afraid for my life.

19:59.408 --> 20:01.994
Have you tried the hot tub yet?
You should try the hot tub.

20:02.536 --> 20:04.872
-Even you can't miss that.
-I ought to…

20:07.749 --> 20:09.084
Have you seen the sundial?

20:09.168 --> 20:11.044
-No.
-No? No? Here, look.

20:11.753 --> 20:13.422
Thirty-six feet tall.

20:13.505 --> 20:17.259
And you know, to get it in, I had to
chop down a tree and install it by crane.

20:17.926 --> 20:18.969
-Amazing.
-Yeah?

20:19.052 --> 20:21.346
-Do you know what time it is?
-No.

20:22.139 --> 20:23.140
Cocktail time.

20:23.223 --> 20:24.725
You don't need a sundial to tell you that.

20:25.559 --> 20:26.768
No, you don't.

20:27.728 --> 20:29.479
You most certainly do not.

20:30.397 --> 20:32.274
Have you played the giant chess?

20:32.858 --> 20:34.902
Go ahead and play some giant chess.

20:36.278 --> 20:40.532
Marty, my sweet.
Why are you so dressed up?

20:40.616 --> 20:41.992
It's not a formal party.

20:43.285 --> 20:44.328
I need to talk to you.

20:45.370 --> 20:48.999
Oh, yeah. Sure, of course.
Hey, come on. Let's…

20:50.709 --> 20:52.794
Marty, your tush is hanging out.

20:56.089 --> 20:57.633
Here. Here. Okay.

20:57.716 --> 21:00.219
-All right.
-Who's that?

21:00.969 --> 21:04.097
That's Chef Pete.
I hired him for the party.

21:04.181 --> 21:06.850
He used to cook for Kevin Bacon
and Kyra Sedgwick.

21:06.934 --> 21:09.061
He's good, but he's no Marty Markowitz.

21:10.229 --> 21:11.230
All right.

21:12.272 --> 21:13.273
What's going on?

21:16.235 --> 21:18.779
For the better part
of the last three decades…

21:20.572 --> 21:23.659
I have dedicated my life to you.

21:23.742 --> 21:26.870
Every weekend, every holiday, everything.

21:27.996 --> 21:30.707
And you couldn't even find
time in your schedule

21:30.791 --> 21:33.794
over the course of four days
to come-- come visit me?

21:34.503 --> 21:35.504
To call me?

21:36.255 --> 21:40.425
To check in on me during one of
the most harrowing experiences of my life?

21:42.302 --> 21:44.721
Okay, I know they pumped you
full of narcotics, Marty,

21:44.805 --> 21:47.224
and that you're a lightweight,
so I'm assuming it's hitting you hard.

21:47.307 --> 21:49.726
I don't underst-- You wanted me to, what,
come by the hospital

21:49.810 --> 21:51.645
with Jell-O and ice cream,

21:51.728 --> 21:53.897
-snuggle up and watch Jungle Book?
-Why?

21:55.148 --> 21:56.358
Why didn't you come?

21:58.235 --> 21:59.653
I thought we were family.

22:01.864 --> 22:03.198
Are you serious?

22:03.282 --> 22:05.450
Marty, I'm worried that you're serious.

22:06.076 --> 22:08.245
You need to know this.
You need to hear this.

22:08.328 --> 22:11.582
I would do anything for you. Anything.

22:11.665 --> 22:13.876
The second you told me
about your procedure,

22:13.959 --> 22:17.171
I called my contacts at NYU Langone
the very next day.

22:17.254 --> 22:18.589
I told them that we're family.

22:18.672 --> 22:21.425
The hospital bed,
the private room you had.

22:21.508 --> 22:23.510
Who do you think did that? I did that.

22:27.222 --> 22:29.683
I can't believe you didn't think
I would do anything.

22:29.766 --> 22:32.728
After all these years,
is that how you see me?

22:32.811 --> 22:35.731
I was just surprised
that you didn't come and visit.

22:37.232 --> 22:40.986
Why didn't you ask me to come? I--
Do you think I'm that much of a schmuck?

22:41.069 --> 22:43.488
You don't think I'm gonna come and--
Of course. Why didn't you say,

22:43.572 --> 22:47.618
"Ike, it would mean a lot if you
swung by"? I'm not a mind reader.

22:47.701 --> 22:49.995
-Well, why--
-You say that you've been by my side

22:50.078 --> 22:51.496
for the better part of three decades.

22:51.580 --> 22:53.248
Well, I'd argue the same thing.

22:53.332 --> 22:57.211
When Debbie and your sister tried
to bleed you dry after your parents died,

22:57.294 --> 22:58.462
who was there?

22:58.545 --> 23:00.839
What about when AFC
wanted to grow and expand?

23:00.923 --> 23:02.591
Who provided you with that opportunity?

23:02.674 --> 23:04.343
When you had a heart attack,

23:04.426 --> 23:08.347
who scooped you up
and held your hand in the ambulance?

23:09.890 --> 23:11.225
Who saved your life?

23:14.686 --> 23:15.687
Marty…

23:17.898 --> 23:19.274
That's loyalty.

23:20.275 --> 23:21.693
That's love.

23:21.777 --> 23:24.530
I'd do anything for you. You're my guy.

23:24.613 --> 23:27.282
I will always show up for you.

23:30.244 --> 23:31.870
You're absolutely right.

23:33.288 --> 23:34.456
I'm sorry.

23:34.540 --> 23:36.834
-I'm sorry.
-Come here, you maniac.

23:36.917 --> 23:38.877
Come-- Come…

23:40.128 --> 23:43.340
Marty, I love you. You are my brother.

23:45.092 --> 23:46.093
You hear me?

23:46.927 --> 23:48.178
-Are you listening?
-Yeah.

23:48.929 --> 23:49.930
Good.

23:51.181 --> 23:54.184
Now get out of this farkakte outfit
and meet me by the pool, huh?

23:54.268 --> 23:55.686
All right. All right.

23:56.436 --> 23:57.437
Okay.

23:58.438 --> 24:01.441
Money in the bank. Ready? Jump.

24:01.525 --> 24:02.526
He's hot.

24:05.946 --> 24:07.114
You just made a hundred bucks.

24:14.538 --> 24:16.164
…because your mother raised you as veal.

24:17.499 --> 24:19.585
Let's go in here, all right?
There's air-conditioning.

24:19.668 --> 24:21.962
There are hundreds of movies,
all Academy Award winners.

24:22.045 --> 24:23.630
Mind the boccie balls.

24:26.258 --> 24:27.634
-Hi, tchotchke.
-Hi.

24:27.718 --> 24:29.178
Having a good time?

24:29.261 --> 24:31.013
-Uh-huh.
-Oh, great.

24:31.096 --> 24:33.307
Maybe you could send the message
to your face?

24:33.390 --> 24:34.474
What?

24:34.558 --> 24:36.476
Maybe you can arrange your features

24:36.560 --> 24:39.771
in a configuration
that expresses some form of enjoyment.

24:39.855 --> 24:41.815
-Fuck you, Ike.
-Come on.

24:41.899 --> 24:44.026
I'm kidding. You look terrific.

24:44.109 --> 24:46.278
I'm worried. What is going on with Marty?

24:46.361 --> 24:47.696
What? Nothing. He's fine.

24:48.280 --> 24:50.490
Yeah, well, he's a little loopy
post-surgery, but he's fine.

24:50.574 --> 24:52.409
No, he doesn't seem fine.

24:52.492 --> 24:55.245
Maybe we should just wrap this up
and just get him some rest.

24:55.329 --> 24:58.582
Wrap this up? What, are you crazy?
Lisa Rinna just got here.

24:58.665 --> 25:00.209
Should we bring him something to eat?

25:00.292 --> 25:03.504
Yeah, sure. I don't know. If you think so.
But one of us has to host this party.

25:03.587 --> 25:04.880
I know, but I don't know.

25:04.963 --> 25:08.175
I think we should just shut this down
and send everybody home. He's not okay.

25:08.258 --> 25:09.593
What are you, the fun police?

25:10.177 --> 25:12.471
Well, don't be ridiculous, Bonnie.
All right?

25:12.554 --> 25:15.057
I've already got one ridiculous wife.
His name is Marty Markowitz.

25:15.140 --> 25:16.600
You don't have to tell me that.

25:27.319 --> 25:29.655
Stu, get away from that rock.

25:29.738 --> 25:31.949
You always get caught
in that little roundabout.

25:35.160 --> 25:36.828
So, did you guys miss me?

25:41.250 --> 25:42.960
Well, I missed you too.

25:43.710 --> 25:45.337
That's very nice of you.

25:46.547 --> 25:48.048
Where's Adam? How's his ich?

25:49.299 --> 25:51.176
Stu, where's Adam?

25:55.305 --> 25:56.306
Where…

25:57.474 --> 25:58.475
Where is he?

25:59.726 --> 26:03.146
Adam?

26:05.190 --> 26:07.401
Where the hell is he? Ada--

26:09.236 --> 26:10.237
What?

26:16.702 --> 26:18.245
Oh, no. Adam.

26:18.328 --> 26:19.329
Adam.

26:25.794 --> 26:27.588
Goddamn fish murderer.

26:31.008 --> 26:32.718
"Brothers," my ass.

26:39.683 --> 26:42.269
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

26:43.228 --> 26:44.855
I'm so sorry.

26:51.236 --> 26:54.406
-Lisa. Ike Herschkopf.
-Hi.

26:54.489 --> 26:56.033
Thanks for coming.

26:56.116 --> 26:57.743
-You look gorgeous, as always.
-Thank you.

26:57.826 --> 27:00.245
-You don't mind if we get a picture?
-Okay. So, which button is--

27:00.329 --> 27:01.622
-On the top.
-I pressed the wrong one.

27:01.705 --> 27:03.957
-Can I just go find my glasses?
-No. No. You know-- It's okay.

27:04.041 --> 27:05.375
Hey, hey! Come. Come here.

27:05.459 --> 27:06.752
Thank you. Thank you.

27:06.835 --> 27:08.670
Come here. Take this picture of us.

27:10.881 --> 27:14.468
-Enjoying yourself?
-I am. I am. Gorgeous. I love the house.

27:14.551 --> 27:15.719
Thank you.

27:15.802 --> 27:17.596
-Success.
-Great.

27:17.679 --> 27:18.847
I wanna show you these cows.

27:18.931 --> 27:20.474
I got 'em in a gallery in the city.

27:20.557 --> 27:22.392
-Okay.
-They're so fun.

27:22.476 --> 27:24.144
Collect some of these wet towels,
would you?

27:24.228 --> 27:26.605
Right over here. It's terrific stuff.

27:40.619 --> 27:44.039
Hey. Hey, Marty. You okay?

27:46.708 --> 27:47.918
Are you in pain?

27:49.753 --> 27:51.004
You-- You know.

27:52.005 --> 27:53.006
Yeah.

27:55.092 --> 27:56.510
Can I get you anything?

27:58.053 --> 27:59.054
I've had enough.

27:59.763 --> 28:01.098
What?

28:03.183 --> 28:04.726
I can't do this.

28:05.769 --> 28:06.979
I've tried, Bonnie.

28:07.062 --> 28:08.689
For so long.

29:16.965 --> 29:17.966
You need something?

29:18.050 --> 29:20.177
I left the Ambien in your bathroom.

29:24.014 --> 29:25.474
What are you looking at?

29:26.099 --> 29:27.976
Party for the ages, it seems.

29:29.770 --> 29:31.730
The lawn is totally trashed.

29:31.813 --> 29:36.068
Well, eight hours of open bar
with your friends is not a good combo.

29:36.151 --> 29:37.528
-I can't get this…
-Our friends.

29:37.611 --> 29:38.612
Your friends.

29:38.695 --> 29:41.949
Marty's got his work cut out for him.
He'll see to it tomorrow. I got it.

29:42.032 --> 29:45.494
Yeah. I don't think that's a good idea.
He just got out of the hospital.

29:45.577 --> 29:47.788
He's been lying in bed,
bored out of his mind,

29:48.288 --> 29:49.623
desperate to get out there.

29:50.749 --> 29:52.709
He likes it, you know.

29:52.793 --> 29:54.044
It's therapeutic for him.

29:58.382 --> 30:01.051
I can't help it if his favorite thing
in the world to do

30:01.134 --> 30:02.427
helps us out sometimes.

30:04.346 --> 30:06.223
Did you hear that Jacob went to the…

30:40.174 --> 30:41.925
Sleep well, friend.

30:43.594 --> 30:45.512
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

31:56.750 --> 32:00.754
That's because it is, Claire.
It's an invasion of your privacy.

32:01.672 --> 32:03.465
Here's what we're going to do. You ready?

32:04.466 --> 32:06.260
-You ready? Okay.
-Yes.

32:07.511 --> 32:10.013
You're going to block your mother
and father on Facebook.

32:10.722 --> 32:12.140
No more wall posts.

32:12.224 --> 32:15.227
-No more pokes. No more tags.
-Really? I--

32:15.310 --> 32:17.855
Yes, really. These are toxic people,

32:17.938 --> 32:21.275
and they need to learn that
if they're going to take advantage of you,

32:21.358 --> 32:22.609
there are consequences.

32:22.693 --> 32:26.488
Yeah. I mean, you're probably right.
Right? Yeah.

32:26.572 --> 32:28.365
-Thank you, Dr. Herschkopf.
-Don't thank me.

32:28.448 --> 32:29.658
This is my job.

32:31.702 --> 32:34.413
And… yeah,
unfortunately we're out of time.

32:34.496 --> 32:36.498
We even went a few minutes over.

32:36.582 --> 32:38.166
But… look.

32:39.001 --> 32:42.546
Call me this week if you wanna schedule
a few more appointments.

32:43.755 --> 32:45.591
This is a big step.

32:45.674 --> 32:49.636
And I think you're going to need me a few
more times to help guide you through.

32:49.720 --> 32:51.263
Okay. Thank you.

32:51.346 --> 32:53.557
-Good seeing you, as always, Claire.
-Yeah.

33:00.147 --> 33:02.649
Hey, Marty. You're late. It's 11:20.

33:03.358 --> 33:07.112
And… just wanna make sure
everything's okay.

33:07.196 --> 33:09.156
You stuck in traffic?

33:09.823 --> 33:12.201
We have an appointment.
Hope to see you soon.

33:26.840 --> 33:29.176
35th and 7th. And avoid 5th Avenue.

33:29.259 --> 33:30.719
-It's a nightmare.
-Got it.

33:30.802 --> 33:32.638
I'm very interested
in the lecture circuit.

33:32.721 --> 33:33.805
I love to travel.

33:35.307 --> 33:37.768
I guess, sure.
Okay, yeah. We'll talk about it then.

33:37.851 --> 33:41.939
Great. And we'd love to take you up
on your offer to visit Stowe next winter.

33:43.440 --> 33:44.441
Sounds terrific.

33:45.859 --> 33:47.361
Well, there is-- Yeah.

33:48.946 --> 33:50.364
Dennis, I have to call you back.

34:05.462 --> 34:07.172
AFC. How may I help you?

34:07.256 --> 34:08.966
I'd like to speak to Marty, please.

34:10.467 --> 34:14.721
Marty is-- is not available right now,
but I could take a message.

34:14.804 --> 34:17.014
-I need to speak to Marty.
-Yeah.

34:17.099 --> 34:19.309
Sure. I'll have him give you a ring back.

34:26.440 --> 34:28.985
Why? My God!
Who takes the bridge at this hour, huh?

34:29.069 --> 34:32.572
At this rate, we'll get there
by the Sabbath. Oh, fuck! Fuck!

34:41.831 --> 34:42.958
Thanks.

35:12.779 --> 35:15.365
-And I don't wanna throw it out.
-Check it out. No, no.

35:15.449 --> 35:18.785
-Because I know it's perfectly brand-new.
-Hey, Cathy.

35:18.869 --> 35:23.332
It's good to see you. Can you point me
in the direction of Marty, please?

35:28.545 --> 35:30.964
Forget it. I'll find him myself.

35:44.186 --> 35:45.979
-What's up?
-Hi, Marty.

35:46.063 --> 35:47.147
Good to see you.

35:48.106 --> 35:49.107
What's…

35:50.150 --> 35:51.151
What's going on?

35:51.235 --> 35:53.987
-Nothing. Just unpacking.
-I can see that.

35:54.071 --> 35:56.823
I got cuts all over my hands
from the cardboard. See?

35:58.116 --> 36:00.410
-That's gotta hurt.
-Yeah. Yeah, a little bit.

36:01.453 --> 36:04.706
Bruce, can you give us a moment, please?

36:18.720 --> 36:20.097
What's…

36:21.056 --> 36:25.018
What's going on?

36:26.353 --> 36:27.354
Well, Marty…

36:28.939 --> 36:30.816
a lot of things are going on.

36:30.899 --> 36:33.277
One being, when did you move?

36:33.360 --> 36:34.820
A few days ago.

36:35.946 --> 36:38.073
But you knew we were moving.

36:38.156 --> 36:39.199
We had to.

36:39.783 --> 36:41.201
The city rent was killing us.

36:41.285 --> 36:44.538
I thought we decided
we were not going to leave the city.

36:45.372 --> 36:46.373
Well,

36:47.374 --> 36:50.919
I know that you decided
that you didn't want to.

36:51.712 --> 36:55.966
But I decided that we had to,
to keep the company from going under.

36:56.049 --> 36:58.177
And since it's my company,

36:59.303 --> 37:00.554
I decided…

37:02.055 --> 37:03.098
that…

37:04.558 --> 37:07.352
that that was the decision.
So, yeah, here we are.

37:07.436 --> 37:09.646
And it's kinda nice.

37:09.730 --> 37:11.857
-Look at the space and the light.
-Yeah.

37:11.940 --> 37:14.109
No. It's the Venice of America.

37:14.193 --> 37:15.736
Can we speak in your office, please?

37:15.819 --> 37:17.112
About that.

37:18.906 --> 37:22.242
We no longer have private offices.

37:22.326 --> 37:26.872
Yeah, it's-- it's more
of an open concept now.

37:26.955 --> 37:28.040
Oh, Marty.

37:29.958 --> 37:32.878
This is… a shame.

37:32.961 --> 37:34.922
-Why?
-You.

37:36.089 --> 37:37.090
All of this.

37:38.842 --> 37:41.178
You've taken a real step backwards.

37:41.261 --> 37:43.847
You're not thinking clearly, Marty.

37:44.765 --> 37:46.558
I have your best interest at heart.

37:46.642 --> 37:50.229
And it's hurting me
to see you hurt yourself like this.

37:50.312 --> 37:51.605
-Is that so?
-Yes, it's so.

37:51.688 --> 37:53.565
It's very much so.

37:54.107 --> 37:57.653
Do you know that I just spent two hours
on the GW Bridge, okay?

37:57.736 --> 38:01.406
George fucking Washington himself
didn't take that long to cross the Hudson.

38:01.490 --> 38:02.407
The Delaware.

38:03.534 --> 38:05.744
-What?
-He crossed the Delaware.

38:05.827 --> 38:07.120
That's-- That is the famous crossing.

38:07.204 --> 38:08.455
-I know.
-He crossed the Delaware.

38:08.539 --> 38:10.958
He was president, Marty.
He crossed a lot of fucking rivers.

38:11.041 --> 38:13.752
How do you think he got to Manhattan
in the first place, huh?

38:13.836 --> 38:15.504
-What, did he take the PATH train?
-Okay.

38:15.587 --> 38:18.590
Let me tell you something.
This arrangement, it's untenable.

38:19.216 --> 38:20.592
It's untenable!

38:21.802 --> 38:23.804
How do you expect me to help AFC

38:23.887 --> 38:26.974
if I am stuck for two hours
schlepping out here, huh?

38:27.057 --> 38:29.309
It's, like, a waste of money, Marty.

38:30.185 --> 38:31.770
It's a waste of your money.

38:38.902 --> 38:39.903
Then don't come.

38:44.616 --> 38:45.617
I beg your pardon?

38:50.247 --> 38:51.748
If it's so much of a hassle,

38:53.500 --> 38:54.835
then maybe you shouldn't come.

38:58.714 --> 38:59.798
Marty…

39:01.633 --> 39:03.343
-are you firing me?
-No.

39:03.427 --> 39:05.721
No. No, of course not.

39:05.804 --> 39:08.515
Good. Good, because I--

39:08.599 --> 39:10.767
But Norman Horowitz is.

39:37.878 --> 39:40.589
-Yes! Yes, Marty. Yes!
-Marty!

39:41.465 --> 39:42.799
Way to go, Marty.

39:44.510 --> 39:45.511
Marty!

39:57.940 --> 39:58.941
Thanks.
