00:14.966 --> 00:15.566
What? 

00:15.600 --> 00:19.000
We can not sit on the couch 
without something happens? 

00:27.164 --> 00:28.400
(Museum of Aeronautics) 

00:30.720 --> 00:35.093
I can not believe 
He has reserved the entire museum. 

00:35.243 --> 00:37.143
Just for a celebration of service. 

00:37.144 --> 00:39.640
It is not fair 
vis-à-vis other visitors. 

00:40.597 --> 00:43.414
We drove 
18 hours to come here. 

00:43.726 --> 00:46.824
But on the other hand, 
this barrier is very sweet! 

00:47.404 --> 00:48.497
Tap it, kids! 

00:51.016 --> 00:53.310
A feast! A feast! A feast! 

00:53.311 --> 00:55.342
Homer, you work 
with these people. 

00:55.343 --> 00:56.580
A little restraint. 

00:56.581 --> 00:59.544
Moderation! 
Moderation! Moderation! 

01:06.291 --> 01:07.347
Calm down, Marge! 

01:07.348 --> 01:10.572
That is my only chance to socialize 
with people I do ever 

01:10.573 --> 01:11.470
As such! 

01:11.535 --> 01:13.437
I am your supervisor. 
- Really? 

01:13.617 --> 01:14.628
How do I do? 

01:15.917 --> 01:19.303
Well, if it is 
not my favorite employee, 

01:19.320 --> 01:20.679
and his wife! 

01:20.827 --> 01:22.945
And they must 
being of children! 

01:23.115 --> 01:24.187
Take a root gimgembre. 

01:25.394 --> 01:26.806
He is 
pretend to be nice ... 

01:26.998 --> 01:29.348
It is suspicious. 
It must prepare something. 

01:29.448 --> 01:32.653
Lisa, Mr. Burns is the adult 
the sweetest I know. 

01:32.879 --> 01:34.192
You know how many adults? 

01:34.352 --> 01:35.678
Basically, he and Dad. 

01:35.751 --> 01:37.618
Joli smoking, Moe. 

01:37.689 --> 01:39.815
Thank you, I bought 
for my funeral. 

01:39.816 --> 01:42.575
There is no rear, then 
I do not ask me back. 

01:44.814 --> 01:46.774
I paid for 
a coffin Molton, 

01:46.775 --> 01:48.151
I bong and blood 
want to feel it. 

01:48.408 --> 01:50.326
Since the dawn of aviation, 

01:50.478 --> 01:54.383
Man has built museums 
dedicated to the history of aviation. 

01:54.646 --> 02:00.045
And created audiovisual materials for 
guide visitors to these museums. 

02:00.163 --> 02:03.038
Since the books 
Animated rudimentary 

02:03.184 --> 02:05.416
to I-MAX from Cape Canaveral. 

02:05.668 --> 02:07.998
Audiovisual materials 
Museum of Aviation 

02:08.156 --> 02:10.424
have taken large and small 

02:10.425 --> 02:13.579
to the hectic 
adventure of understanding. 

02:13.780 --> 02:17.844
This is the story 
of these materials. 

02:21.106 --> 02:23.961
type in a 
Burns giant head. 

02:28.710 --> 02:30.079
It sounds like Burns! 

02:35.500 --> 02:37.000
It is a great imitation! 

02:38.100 --> 02:44.400
Here is a period piece on the waterfall 
Air Springfield: Agnes Skinner! 

03:04.000 --> 03:07.983
A wooden plane! It was time 
that trees are used to something. 

03:08.200 --> 03:10.571
Rather than keep you planted 
straight as morons. 

03:11.000 --> 03:13.671
The Pelican Wood is more 
wide as a football field. 

03:13.960 --> 03:16.251
It weighs heavier than 
the State of New Hampshire. 

03:16.580 --> 03:17.920
It has flown only once, 

03:17.921 --> 03:20.668
under the command of his 
creator C. Montgomery Burns. 

03:20.914 --> 03:25.370
It flew at an altitude of 2mètres, 
a distance of 1m50! 

03:25.841 --> 03:27.971
Then it was discovered that the rain 
Starting in the flames. 

03:28.612 --> 03:30.127
Then the Führer me fired. 

03:30.200 --> 03:32.632
What a wonderful reception! 

03:32.854 --> 03:34.632
M Burns is a great man! 

03:34.900 --> 03:37.811
I still 
a bad right now. 

03:38.050 --> 03:42.200
Let margin, it's great here. 
Admission free, servers song 

03:42.300 --> 03:44.769
And we can use 
toilets of the future. 

03:45.083 --> 03:47.036
Homer was a reactor! 

03:48.600 --> 03:50.157
Hello, drug addicts wage. 

03:50.600 --> 03:52.278
Everyone is 
happy and satisfied? 

03:52.672 --> 03:53.810
Yes! 
- It's great! 

03:53.950 --> 03:55.126
I would give my life for you. 

03:55.250 --> 03:56.673
Where is your sense of fayotage? 

03:56.935 --> 03:58.304
Go ahead, super boss! 

04:00.000 --> 04:01.275
Entering into force immediately 

04:01.276 --> 04:03.469
the coverage plan 
Social workers ... 

04:03.470 --> 04:04.800
... Is abolished! 

04:06.602 --> 04:10.200
Year after year, the health service ... 
bla bla bla, forms of politeness, 

04:10.300 --> 04:11.086
Out! 

04:12.100 --> 04:15.489
This must be the nasty surprise 
announced in the invitation. 

04:18.500 --> 04:19.413
Catch it! 

04:24.500 --> 04:25.410
Fly, stupid! 

04:25.870 --> 04:28.621
I tried to explain that 
this machine does not really flying. 

04:28.979 --> 04:31.386
Smithers, he must believe! 

04:45.200 --> 04:47.371
Next stop, Parad'Ile! 

04:49.400 --> 04:51.331
Well, it was a great fete. 

04:51.806 --> 04:56.007
You think Carole of accounting 
and Mike mail will flirt? 

04:57.120 --> 04:57.800
He is married. 

04:58.200 --> 05:00.200
Change of course 
Carole must be notified. 

05:04.898 --> 05:07.910
Now that Burns 
eliminated coverage, 

05:07.910 --> 05:10.575
we will have reduced 
our Expenditure disease! 

05:10.800 --> 05:11.875
I will find a second job. 

05:12.000 --> 05:12.700
One that pays well. 

05:13.000 --> 05:15.100
Think team 
"Friends" looking for a new player? 

05:15.300 --> 05:16.897
This series is not even broadcast! 

05:17.000 --> 05:19.916
Gee, I have been perfect in the role 
Irish cousin of Rachel! 

05:20.235 --> 05:25.347
So you separate? 
But who will take care of the old Shamus? 

05:30.008 --> 05:32.271
I need a new job, which can 
to live my whole family. 

05:32.900 --> 05:36.040
As long as I do not work more than 5h 
by day, without lifting heavy weight. 

05:36.041 --> 05:38.650
No job at the church, 
nor as Father Christmas in the nuts ... 

05:38.700 --> 05:39.800
With people who enjoy nudity. 

05:40.000 --> 05:42.229
Let me see what I found. 

05:46.997 --> 05:51.333
You have overcome the monster 
Level 3, Phobos is safe. 

05:51.800 --> 05:53.736
Phobos? 
I am well pleased. 

05:54.800 --> 05:56.500
Many local businesses follow 
Traces of the nuclear power plant 

05:56.600 --> 06:00.013
and decide to delete 
their coverage. 

06:00.014 --> 06:01.306
Even here on Chanel 6! 

06:01.700 --> 06:05.207
Children go to the 
pharmacy of your parents. 

06:05.208 --> 06:09.703
And find the pills marked: 
Lithium dibromide. 

06:09.932 --> 06:11.750
And send them to me. 
Now! 

06:11.850 --> 06:13.600
Nobody likes 
Clown lunatics! 

06:23.089 --> 06:24.138
To cope with this crisis, 

06:24.138 --> 06:26.805
many are trying forms 
alternative treatment! 

06:26.806 --> 06:29.741
I treat with Ralph 
pills from criminal evidence! 

06:32.167 --> 06:33.581
I have desires smuggling mad! 

06:33.600 --> 06:35.367
Of course, everything would be easier 

06:35.368 --> 06:37.030
if the pharmaceutical industry 
proposed affordable prices! 

06:37.200 --> 06:39.431
Dr. Julius Hebert, 
do you agree? 

06:39.650 --> 06:41.574
I can not throw 
stone in these companies. 

06:41.800 --> 06:44.600
All make mistakes, but 
they know their next deal! 

06:44.601 --> 06:48.500
Let me introduce you to the very 
pretty pom pom girls Pfizer! 

06:50.200 --> 06:51.600
"I like big buttocks, 
and I can not deny it. " 

07:00.200 --> 07:03.360
Pfizer assumes no responsibility for any 
dizziness or divorce premature. 

07:06.415 --> 07:10.646
I would say that it is always a pleasure 
dialogue with a mother and daughter, 

07:10.909 --> 07:13.650
which have neutralized the security, 
and forced the entrance of my office. 

07:13.850 --> 07:17.020
I just want to ask why 
a small pill costs $ 30? 

07:17.374 --> 07:19.440
In other countries, 
drugs are cheaper. 

07:19.441 --> 07:23.229
And in these other countries, we sit 
the ground to eat insects. 

07:23.464 --> 07:24.510
In which country? 

07:24.819 --> 07:25.800
Have you ever visited Norway? 

07:25.801 --> 07:26.300
No. 

07:26.450 --> 07:27.724
Well, this is the case in Norway. 

07:27.725 --> 07:30.015
That's why 
Every day I thank God 

07:30.016 --> 07:31.843
for the price too 
expensive drug. 

07:33.061 --> 07:35.850
I mean, the right price. 
Finally, a low price. 

07:36.027 --> 07:37.563
Watch this video. 

07:41.040 --> 07:42.475
The majestic river Amazonnienne. 

07:42.794 --> 07:44.400
The Indians had a name for it. 

07:44.600 --> 07:47.800
But it was rid of Indians 
and we forgot that word. 

07:48.200 --> 07:50.800
But here's a word you can forget 

07:50.850 --> 07:52.500
by Huey Lewis and The News. 

07:53.700 --> 07:55.000
"I want a new drug!" 

08:13.021 --> 08:14.859
This is your medicine. 

08:15.631 --> 08:18.527
Wait, it's not a drug! 
is a cashew nut! 

08:18.841 --> 08:19.700
I have a cork bottle. 

08:21.000 --> 08:22.773
Mine flew. 

08:23.245 --> 08:25.107
Let me explain 
from behind the grille. 

08:26.217 --> 08:28.351
Your pills have become very expensive. 

08:28.715 --> 08:35.299
And as everyone is sheet you 
it was decided to let you die. 

08:35.804 --> 08:38.429
For those who survive this night, 
Tomorrow morning there will be waffles. 

08:39.897 --> 08:41.315
Mmm, waffles! 

08:41.947 --> 08:46.799
I did not survive the 2nd World War and to die! 

08:47.230 --> 08:48.702
I will fight! 

08:49.602 --> 08:52.632
It is crazy, but 
do you want, it is young! 

08:53.939 --> 08:56.790
Pharmaceutical companies 
will not help us. 

08:57.134 --> 08:57.983
I have the solution! 

08:58.339 --> 08:58.830
Dad? 

08:59.154 --> 09:02.538
Thank God, this is a good home. 
This is the 4th try. 

09:02.807 --> 09:06.177
The drugs that we seek 
are just across the border. 

09:06.737 --> 09:08.353
I have a friend who can help us. 

09:08.823 --> 09:12.172
The border? I should do 
remove my fingerprints. 

09:16.764 --> 09:18.177
I could wear gloves. 

09:18.300 --> 09:19.593
No, they are upstairs. 

09:26.500 --> 09:30.864
We're gringos come muchos dineros spend in your country. 

09:31.153 --> 09:33.147
Beautiful! 
Welcome to Canada.

09:37.613 --> 09:40.145
This is your false cards

09:40.399 --> 09:43.792
Go to any pharmacy, 
they give you enough médoc 

09:43.793 --> 09:46.387
to get the Queen 
of England to Shania Twain. 

09:48.053 --> 09:49.194
It is good Johnny. 

09:49.524 --> 09:54.128
Johnny thank you a thousand times. 
As a gift, here's a DVD player. 

09:56.125 --> 09:59.302
What is ... Where there is syrup? 

10:02.618 --> 10:04.500
I would like Vayax ... 

10:05.500 --> 10:09.766
And a blood pressure monitor ....
With a dial! 

10:10.000 --> 10:11.581
Anything you want, 
Canadian man. 

10:11.800 --> 10:13.732
Canadian? 
Looking for a fight? 

10:14.800 --> 10:16.386
Finally, I mean, just you see! 

10:18.196 --> 10:19.196
( "White Rabbit" - Jefferson Airplane) 

10:45.249 --> 10:46.442
Anything to declare? 

10:46.796 --> 10:51.122
I declare that you have the most 
beautiful brown eyes that are! 

10:51.360 --> 10:53.509
And I think 
you hide ... 

10:53.510 --> 10:56.204
a heart as big 
that our borders! 

10:56.300 --> 10:59.174
Now déguerpissez! 
Grand crazy. 

11:02.522 --> 11:03.886
He had a passport? 

11:04.165 --> 11:06.042
Yes ... for my heart. 

11:07.118 --> 11:09.192
Drugs, Drugs! 

11:09.647 --> 11:11.112
Read the instructions! 

11:12.461 --> 11:13.898
Where do I put the records? 

11:14.800 --> 11:15.800
Whose turn? 

11:16.000 --> 11:19.925
I have pills to make you sleep, 
eliminate clot, copulating. 

11:20.167 --> 11:21.283
In that order! 

11:21.966 --> 11:25.909
Grand Father, we would like 
thank you for your gesture. 

11:26.858 --> 11:31.362
Please accept this jacket

11:31.727 --> 11:36.058
Look, the same D 
and for Dumbo Drop ... 

11:37.100 --> 11:40.200
Incredibly, only three 
have never been purchased. 

11:42.200 --> 11:45.700
Margin? Bart? Lisa? 

11:48.681 --> 11:50.387
Aloha! 

11:50.867 --> 11:52.730
It's like Hawaii! 

11:52.731 --> 11:54.862
Unless we can leave 
the hotel without getting hit! 

11:54.863 --> 11:55.955
What's new? 

11:55.956 --> 11:57.170
We just wanted to thank you. 

11:57.171 --> 12:00.480
With Xanax, I am no longer 
anxious to be a Simpsons! 

12:00.481 --> 12:04.456
I just afraid of being hooked 
the Xanax, but it made me forget. 

12:06.304 --> 12:08.234
My father, this mule. 

12:14.247 --> 12:16.136
I need something to calm my stomach. 

12:19.759 --> 12:21.592
I should take it with a meal. 

12:27.762 --> 12:30.561
But here's Mr. Homer, my favorite customer! 

12:30.990 --> 12:33.439
Please take a Playboy, 

12:33.440 --> 12:36.439
and tell me to return to a 
country I am not originating. 

12:36.659 --> 12:40.000
Why this tone Apu charmer? 
Looking for médoc 'Cheap? 

12:40.287 --> 12:42.216
Please let me participate in 
one of your travel contraband. 

12:42.648 --> 12:44.516
My 8 babies make me crazy! 

12:44.794 --> 12:47.940
they cough, 
sneezes, and make noise! 

12:47.941 --> 12:50.658
They fear my 
concierge who dares get out! 

12:50.915 --> 12:52.045
What does this mean? 

12:52.046 --> 12:55.772
I do not even understand my 
bad jokes! I'm tired. 

12:56.353 --> 12:58.785
Homer, help me. 
Ronnie needs her insulin. 

12:59.271 --> 13:01.506
It breaks my heart 
to see delirious. 

13:01.976 --> 13:03.674
Flanders? I do not know. 

13:03.941 --> 13:07.517
What did you do for me 
from giving me $ 5000 yesterday? 

13:07.761 --> 13:09.575
I do not pretend to be 
the perfect neighbor. 

13:09.700 --> 13:13.859
If you let us come, I leave you 
Only 10 minutes with my squishy machine. 

13:13.860 --> 13:14.860
You do what you want ... 

13:15.300 --> 13:16.192
No camera? 

13:19.278 --> 13:20.583
No camera. 

13:22.787 --> 13:25.931
Homer, tell Ned to stop 
I want to convert. 

13:26.325 --> 13:28.943
I told her it was just 
courage to believe in a false God. 

13:29.150 --> 13:31.942
I do not believe in one God. 

13:32.000 --> 13:34.500
Rather, a 
super team of gods. 

13:35.600 --> 13:37.400
He made a fillip! 

13:37.600 --> 13:39.799
Where is she gone, 
ta super team? 

13:39.800 --> 13:42.632
I'll tell you 
which is the true God, 

13:42.633 --> 13:44.933
but only if you stay calm. 

13:46.567 --> 13:48.419
Okay, I go back. 

13:48.698 --> 13:49.809
Shiva Help! 

13:50.058 --> 13:51.407
Why did not you 
a superhero in place? 

13:51.610 --> 13:52.591
Why you do not farm? 

13:52.600 --> 13:54.421
(Welcome to Winnipeg. We are 
born here, what is your excuse?) 

13:56.958 --> 13:59.994
Tabernacle! Ca c't'un 
criss' heap of pills! 

14:00.413 --> 14:02.160
For a new Vietnam? 

14:02.560 --> 14:04.180
Hi, you are the northern neighbor. 

14:04.423 --> 14:05.928
I appreciate your way of speaking. 

14:14.939 --> 14:16.692
Say you want to draw a 
Taffe on my joint? 

14:16.955 --> 14:17.749
It's legal here. 

14:18.773 --> 14:20.716
I was warned that Satan 
would be charming. Here we go! 

14:23.226 --> 14:24.999
Anyone want coffee? 

14:25.358 --> 14:26.695
It does not come from this station? 

14:26.696 --> 14:28.635
Because I do 
not to give my dog. 

14:28.961 --> 14:30.279
No, no, it's homemade. 

14:30.280 --> 14:33.418
Attention is even hotter 
a dispatch from Fox News. 

14:38.922 --> 14:41.343
Wait, let me a t'enrouler 
wet towel around his head. 

14:45.900 --> 14:48.639
Stop it, he expresses his faith! 

14:51.000 --> 14:52.818
Wait, we just 
mere tourists! 

15:06.412 --> 15:07.599
I just take a sip! 

15:08.740 --> 15:11.706
Police have dismantled an organization 
American contraband. 

15:11.975 --> 15:14.925
Former astronaut 
  Homer Simpson was arrested. 

15:15.280 --> 15:18.070
My buttocks are huge 
when I'm handcuffed. 

15:19.356 --> 15:21.602
We have confiscated your 
car and its contents. 

15:25.146 --> 15:27.130
You can leave Canada, but never returned. 

15:31.963 --> 15:33.892
I am a big fat french stupid. 

15:39.019 --> 15:41.969
More medicine, we 
dropped everyone. 

15:42.345 --> 15:43.703
Your coat, senor. 

15:44.789 --> 15:47.402
Fortunately, we have 
not put your name on the front! 

15:49.606 --> 15:51.281
Dad, you did your best. 

15:51.282 --> 15:54.095
For the first time 
I can say without being drunk ... 

15:54.493 --> 15:56.920
I am 
really proud of you! 

16:00.300 --> 16:01.777
It is illegal to drink 
on the road. 

16:03.295 --> 16:05.650
But it went where? 
Let good ... 

16:07.024 --> 16:09.670
There is nothing better than to 
disappear a social plan industry. 

16:09.670 --> 16:12.300
I feel in agreement 
with the forces of the universe. 

16:12.671 --> 16:13.558
I agree, sir. 

16:13.992 --> 16:15.058
Shut up! 

16:15.402 --> 16:16.671
I'm tired of you. 

16:17.051 --> 16:19.794
you're always agree, 
always available, you .. 

16:20.134 --> 16:21.432
you drive by land. 

16:22.708 --> 16:25.916
Smithers, in the case of any 
joke cease immediately. 

16:26.376 --> 16:29.015
Sir, my thyroid swells. 

16:29.068 --> 16:32.330
Stop that! I need 
your throat for my speech. 

16:32.335 --> 16:33.894
When you canceled 
medical coverage, 

16:33.895 --> 16:35.014
I could not pay me my Firox. 

16:36.041 --> 16:40.387
But before dying, 
I tell you .... 

16:45.079 --> 16:48.262
Hang Smithers. I will stir 
heaven and earth to save you. 

16:48.263 --> 16:51.513
It is always easier than explaining 
another my filing system. 

16:51.876 --> 16:54.495
As long as I make one last big blow. 

16:54.718 --> 16:56.998
But we can never 
pass over the border. 

16:58.069 --> 17:00.572
There are other ways 
to enter Canada. 

17:07.435 --> 17:09.291
But of course, a plane! 

17:09.292 --> 17:12.281
Hide drugs in an airplane? 
It will never work! 

17:12.534 --> 17:15.791
Of course if that! 
We just need a driver. 

17:16.165 --> 17:18.037
I have everything you need! 

17:19.250 --> 17:20.500
Katherine Hepburn! 

17:20.599 --> 17:23.376
But no, poor fool! 
Burns is me. Follow me. 

17:25.044 --> 17:28.598
Finally, my plane 
has fulfilled its original goal ... 

17:28.932 --> 17:31.464
Overturn U.S. laws! 

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
(Somewhere a Manitoba) 

17:35.210 --> 17:36.886
It seems that your 
plane is almost full. 

17:37.149 --> 17:38.296
Should not be overloaded. 

17:38.610 --> 17:41.158
Trouillardise 
Typical Canadian! 

17:41.656 --> 17:45.094
That's why you have balls 
snow, and the H-bomb! 

17:45.504 --> 17:47.814
Thank you for your help Johnny. 

17:48.063 --> 17:49.663
How do you thank? 

17:50.400 --> 17:54.591
I always wanted to see 
a man with the IQ of a child 

17:54.592 --> 17:56.378
  to enforce 
by the government. 

17:56.704 --> 17:57.881
We did not like it here. 

17:58.116 --> 18:01.474
Really? In America, 
is four times a week. 

18:02.206 --> 18:04.814
We see happening, and I find you 
places the highest priority. 

18:05.073 --> 18:06.321
I am well pleased. 

18:09.435 --> 18:12.080
We lose altitude. It is time 
to get rid of unnecessary weight. 

18:13.679 --> 18:15.480
Do not throw me, I can lose weight. 

18:15.749 --> 18:17.193
Let me just a chance. 

18:19.550 --> 18:20.508
I prefer to die. 

18:22.200 --> 18:24.600
Nothing was done, we will have 
emergency arise. 

18:24.700 --> 18:26.635
At least, we share 
this critical situation ... 

18:27.130 --> 18:28.610
There is a 3 parachutes. 

18:28.990 --> 18:30.325
It is for me ... 

18:30.760 --> 18:33.067
And the other 2 are 
gifts for my nephews. 

18:37.861 --> 18:39.512
Homer, you're sure 
Learn steer it? 

18:39.751 --> 18:41.749
I get both 
we have wings! 

18:42.800 --> 18:43.698
Oh cow! 

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
You are under arrest. 

18:59.200 --> 19:00.000
For what reason? 

19:00.300 --> 19:02.626
To have scared a policeman! 

19:05.805 --> 19:08.380
Climb in the car, 
and do not touch guns ... 

19:08.679 --> 19:09.529
I just reload. 

19:09.843 --> 19:11.756
You might have to stop too. 

19:12.020 --> 19:16.109
Abe Simpson is that I 
kept my fleece. 

19:16.615 --> 19:18.781
He treated my limbago ... Thank you! 

19:18.782 --> 19:20.418
My episodes of incontinence. 

19:20.419 --> 19:23.198
My glaviose purulent! 
It's been a bad! 

19:23.542 --> 19:26.352
Thanks to the pills immunisantes 
against the lactose 

19:26.561 --> 19:29.225
I can drink 
Krusty the milkshake. 

19:30.889 --> 19:31.815
Disgraceful! 

19:32.738 --> 19:34.773
And although Simpson, you 
helped a lot of people here. 

19:35.172 --> 19:37.976
As stated in the manual 
Springfield's police ... 

19:38.286 --> 19:40.000
If you can not 
safe, join them! 

19:42.643 --> 19:44.406
Chief, I watched 
in the manual. 

19:44.761 --> 19:46.587
Many of your quotes 
did not appear at all. 

19:46.881 --> 19:48.211
Look a little closer, Lou. 

19:59.300 --> 20:00.500
I hope it's not too late. 

20:09.994 --> 20:11.639
Swallow this medication. Hurry! 

20:12.884 --> 20:14.073
It does not work. 

20:14.336 --> 20:17.423
Only my soul and my breath 
can save him. 

20:25.924 --> 20:28.054
Sir, you saved my life! 

20:28.413 --> 20:29.959
Yes ... 

20:30.257 --> 20:32.191
I was a crazy old embittered ... 

20:32.731 --> 20:37.800
I will bring all my employees 
full-time this coverage. 

20:38.828 --> 20:39.738
Great news! 

20:40.037 --> 20:42.484
M Burns made me a 
freelance consultant! 

20:43.800 --> 20:46.156
What is size? 

20:47.305 --> 20:53.273
