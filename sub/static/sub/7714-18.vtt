00:03.169 --> 00:05.170
Hey, Jim.
Jim ! Come here.

00:06.256 --> 00:07.756
Do you know who that is?

00:07.841 --> 00:08.841
No.

00:08.925 --> 00:10.050
Look at him.
Look at him.

00:10.135 --> 00:11.176
T-shirt, jeans.

00:11.261 --> 00:13.679
ls it you?
(LAUGHS) l am flattered.

00:14.931 --> 00:16.056
That's Johnny Depp.

00:16.141 --> 00:18.851
Where'd you take that?
ln my condo complex.

00:18.935 --> 00:21.228
Oh, my God, that's right!
l read in PeopIe magazine

00:21.312 --> 00:23.439
that he was looking for
a two-bedroom condo
in Scranton.

00:23.523 --> 00:24.940
l'm flipping out, man.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.775
Well, you remember my idea
for the fourth Pirates movie.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.027
Sure. That they should do one.

00:28.111 --> 00:32.656
Hey, Jim, Jim,
where do l find
the Black Pearl?

00:32.741 --> 00:34.825
Who's that?
Captain Jack Sparrow.

00:34.909 --> 00:36.702
Captain Jack Sparrow, Jim.

00:36.786 --> 00:38.287
John Dillinger.

00:39.289 --> 00:41.040
No, l'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

00:41.124 --> 00:42.624
Cap'n Crunch.

00:42.792 --> 00:44.626
Okay. Okay.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.712
Screw you, Halpert.

00:46.796 --> 00:50.090
You know, it's not easy
getting excited about stuff.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.468
Remember how
you felt when you thought
you'd seen Roger Clemens?

00:52.552 --> 00:53.552
At the Yankees game.

00:53.636 --> 00:54.845
Yeah. Well, it wasn't him.

00:54.929 --> 00:57.347
l had
a little better
reason to believe that. . .

00:58.349 --> 00:59.975
You're right.
You're right.

01:00.727 --> 01:02.519
Well, you're not right,
because Johnny Depp. . .

01:02.604 --> 01:04.730
l know. l know!
. . .in your condo complex?

01:04.814 --> 01:08.609
lt also explains
why the name on his
mailbox was M. Schulman.

01:12.238 --> 01:13.864
M. Night Schulman?

01:37.263 --> 01:38.263
First up,

01:38.348 --> 01:41.058
the Lost and Found has
gone missing.

01:41.142 --> 01:42.893
lt itself is lost,

01:42.977 --> 01:45.854
so please try not to lose
anything until we find it.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.482
(EXCLAlMS) Pet day.
lf you don't have a pet
please don't feel like. . .

01:48.566 --> 01:50.859
When are we
getting to sales topics?

01:50.944 --> 01:53.403
Yeah. What about those leads?
Did you hear anything
from corporate?

01:53.488 --> 01:55.405
Ah, yes, the leads.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.741
The leads that
Sabre has spent $50,000

01:57.826 --> 02:01.578
to get
from a market research
company are not here yet.

02:01.663 --> 02:02.913
PHYLLlS: Man.
MlCHAEL: But will be. . .

02:03.039 --> 02:05.541
DWlGHT: Damn it!
No, no, no. No.
Meeting's not over.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.960
But is there
anything relevant
to the sales staff here?

02:08.044 --> 02:09.837
No sales topic, per se.

02:09.921 --> 02:12.798
Well, then
no Andy Bernard, per se.

02:12.882 --> 02:14.258
PHYLLlS: l agree.

02:14.384 --> 02:16.468
Dwight?
Sorry. Michael,
l got calls to make.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.512
l would like your
undivided attention, please.

02:18.596 --> 02:21.056
You couldn't handle
my undivided attention.

02:22.559 --> 02:25.894
Over the last few weeks,
things have been
changing here.

02:26.729 --> 02:30.524
Sabre says it is our duty
to support the sales team,

02:30.608 --> 02:33.193
and the saIesmen are
letting it go to
their heads.

02:33.278 --> 02:34.945
I think it's kind of
screwed up,

02:35.029 --> 02:36.655
because the way
this place used to work

02:36.739 --> 02:39.950
was make
friends first,
make sales second,

02:40.076 --> 02:42.828
make love third,
in no particular order.

02:45.039 --> 02:46.039
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
(CLEARS THROAT)

02:46.124 --> 02:48.417
Listen, Michael,

02:48.668 --> 02:50.586
about what
happened earlier.

02:50.670 --> 02:51.879
MlCHAEL: Yeah?

02:51.963 --> 02:53.672
When l was asking about
the leads.

02:53.756 --> 02:54.882
Mmm-hmm.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.592
ls there any news
on the leads?

02:57.760 --> 02:58.844
ls that
all you have
to say to me?

02:58.928 --> 03:01.597
Yeah. You got any
news on the leads?

03:02.348 --> 03:03.348
Okay, l tell you what.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.559
l'm going out on
a very important
sales call.

03:05.643 --> 03:08.020
You get any news
about the leads,
you try me.

03:08.104 --> 03:10.647
All of my numbers.
All six of my numbers, okay?

03:10.732 --> 03:12.691
lncluding the car phone!

03:14.485 --> 03:15.861
All right, Dwight out!

03:15.945 --> 03:17.571
Salesman is King.

03:17.655 --> 03:20.365
As the best salesman,
l am King of Kings.

03:21.117 --> 03:23.702
Oh, you say Jesus
is King of Kings?

03:23.786 --> 03:27.497
Well, what does
that say to you about
how l think of myself?

03:31.544 --> 03:32.878
(CLEARS THROAT)

03:32.962 --> 03:34.838
Do you not
answer emails anymore?

03:34.923 --> 03:38.717
Because l have
emailed you four times
asking you to come to my desk.

03:38.801 --> 03:40.802
Honey, if l
don't have time
to answer an email,

03:40.887 --> 03:44.097
l definitely
don't have time to
walk over to your desk.

03:44.182 --> 03:46.016
Wow, wowie, wowie.

03:46.517 --> 03:48.977
Congratulations.
lt's a big check.

03:50.563 --> 03:51.772
Oh, sorry, one second.

03:51.856 --> 03:53.273
MlCHAEL: Stop sexting Pam.

03:53.358 --> 03:54.608
l'm trying to
congratulate you.

03:54.692 --> 03:58.070
This is actually
a big potential
sale, so. . .

03:58.154 --> 03:59.905
You're writing your
memoirs over there?

03:59.989 --> 04:01.323
You writing your
name over there?

04:01.407 --> 04:02.574
Well, it's a pretty big check.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.368
lt's good, you know,
with the kid.

04:04.452 --> 04:06.703
Okay. Don't gloat.
Here's the thing.

04:06.788 --> 04:08.997
This kind of money
can corrupt people.

04:09.290 --> 04:11.250
All right,
here we go. "Michael."

04:11.334 --> 04:12.584
MlCHAEL: l'm just
saying that. . .

04:12.669 --> 04:13.835
"Michael."

04:16.422 --> 04:17.422
Great.

04:17.507 --> 04:20.550
Teddy, nice. Let me just. . .
Let me write that down
real quick.

04:20.635 --> 04:22.803
Pencil. Give me a pencil.

04:24.555 --> 04:28.058
Hang on, Teddy.
l'm making a sale.

04:28.142 --> 04:29.351
Mmm-hmm.
Sales.

04:29.435 --> 04:30.435
Mmm-hmm.

04:30.520 --> 04:31.770
There's other pencils
in this office.

04:31.854 --> 04:33.188
Give me. . .

sandwich time.

04:48.454 --> 04:49.663
Mike.

04:49.747 --> 04:51.790
Oh, you gotta
be kidding me.

04:51.874 --> 04:53.333
Look at that. That's. . .

04:53.418 --> 04:54.626
l know who did that.

04:54.711 --> 04:57.587
(EXHALES)
You saw who did this
and you didn't stop them?

04:57.672 --> 05:00.215
Didn't have to see.
lt was sales, l can feel it.

05:00.675 --> 05:02.426
They are out of control.

05:02.885 --> 05:04.678
The sales department
smashed my sandwich.

05:04.762 --> 05:06.805
Yes. All of them.

05:06.889 --> 05:08.765
Together.
lt's a conspiracy.

05:09.642 --> 05:10.642
Listen to me, Mike.

05:10.727 --> 05:12.769
You gotta do
something about them.

05:12.854 --> 05:13.854
You don't get it.

05:13.938 --> 05:16.481
You need to get back on top.

05:17.066 --> 05:19.359
That's what she said.
That's what she said.

05:19.444 --> 05:20.861
Yeah.
Yeah.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.781
Something came
for you, Michael.

05:24.866 --> 05:25.991
Thank you very much.

05:26.075 --> 05:27.409
What'd you get?

05:27.535 --> 05:29.369
Uh, it's just
the stupid leads.
JlM: All right!

05:29.454 --> 05:31.330
About time.
Yeah ! Me likey!

05:31.414 --> 05:34.291
Yeah, finally, Michael.
Hand them over, numbnuts.

05:35.293 --> 05:38.670
But seriously, l mean,
it's your job to give
us those leads.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.088
All right.

05:40.590 --> 05:43.508
Then l guess l should
give them out. Hold on.

05:45.261 --> 05:47.137
You know what l'm thinking?

05:47.221 --> 05:49.598
l'm thinking that l have
something that you want.

05:49.682 --> 05:51.975
You guys are acting
like you own this place,

05:52.060 --> 05:53.226
and you don't.

05:53.311 --> 05:56.188
Not even Sabre owns
this place. lt's a rental.

05:56.272 --> 05:58.023
l'm kind of sick of
the attitude around here.

05:58.107 --> 05:59.941
l'm sick of
the cocky walk.

06:00.026 --> 06:03.945
l am
sick of you throwing
your paycheck in my face.

06:04.238 --> 06:06.948
l am sick of your
uppity attitude, Jim.

06:08.493 --> 06:12.287
l think
l am not going to
give these to you.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.663
KEVlN: Yes!
MEREDlTH: Yeah !

06:13.748 --> 06:15.374
We need those leads, Michael.

06:15.458 --> 06:18.168
That's our job,
Michael. Michael !

06:21.381 --> 06:23.507
GABE: Michael, we spent
a lot of money on those leads.

06:23.591 --> 06:24.674
You have to
give them out.

06:24.759 --> 06:27.260
Then we are
just rewarding
their bad behavior.

06:27.345 --> 06:30.222
Okay, just imagine

06:30.306 --> 06:33.475
that instead of
going to jail for
murdering someone,

06:33.893 --> 06:35.852
you got an ice cream cone.

06:35.937 --> 06:38.605
lf that were the case,
then in the summertime,

06:38.689 --> 06:42.359
everyone would go
around killing people

06:43.444 --> 06:45.654
for the pleasure
of an ice cream cone.

06:45.738 --> 06:48.782
Michael, l don't want
to incentivize murder,

06:48.866 --> 06:50.575
but we've tried
to make it cIear

06:50.660 --> 06:52.994
that our policy
emphasizes sales staff.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.330
They act like
l have no power.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.332
But you do.
You are in charge...

06:57.417 --> 06:59.084
Thank you.
...of supporting
the saIes staff.

06:59.168 --> 07:00.919
You are required to hand
out those leads, Michael.

07:01.003 --> 07:02.129
Mmm-hmm.

07:02.213 --> 07:06.049
Well, if that is what l am
required to do, l will do
exactly that.

07:06.134 --> 07:07.801
Okay, good.
Exactly that.

07:07.885 --> 07:09.636
Good.
Exactly that.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.138
Why do you
keep repeating...

07:13.391 --> 07:16.476
Hello. May l
have everyone's
attention, please?

07:16.727 --> 07:18.770
Gabe has
instructed me to
hand out the leads,

07:18.855 --> 07:22.524
so l am going to give
the leads to King Creed.

07:22.692 --> 07:23.775
What?
What are you. . .

07:23.860 --> 07:26.778
And to King Meredith !

07:26.863 --> 07:28.113
They aren't
sales people.

07:28.197 --> 07:30.365
And to King Angela.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.827
Because today we are
all kings and queens.

07:34.412 --> 07:35.912
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

07:35.997 --> 07:38.498
l am giving them
the leads, Phyllis.

07:43.421 --> 07:45.172
Hey.
Hey.

07:45.339 --> 07:47.507
So l'm gonna go ahead
and save you some time,

07:47.592 --> 07:50.635
and tell
you that no one's
gonna go along with this.

07:50.720 --> 07:51.803
But you knew that, right?

07:51.888 --> 07:52.929
Mmm-hmm.

07:53.014 --> 07:56.975
All right. So,
why don't you just give
me my share of the leads,

07:57.310 --> 07:59.311
and l'll start
making some calls?

07:59.395 --> 08:00.520
Okay.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.026
Hey, all right.
All right.

08:07.403 --> 08:08.570
(GROANS)

08:09.197 --> 08:10.989
These aren't leads.
What are they?

08:11.073 --> 08:13.533
(CLlCKS TONGUE) Oh, right.
Those are clues,

08:13.618 --> 08:15.494
and within each clue
is a lesson.

08:15.578 --> 08:18.079
You learn a lesson,
and then you find a lead.

08:18.164 --> 08:21.666
The leads are scattered
all over the industrial park.

08:21.751 --> 08:24.711
l'm trying to make
your kids respect you,

08:24.795 --> 08:28.131
because a father
needs to respect
his boss,

08:28.216 --> 08:31.510
and kids don't respect
the father who doesn't
respect the boss.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.053
Do you understand
that line of logic?

08:33.137 --> 08:34.346
l don't even think
you understand it.

08:34.430 --> 08:36.181
l do understand it.

08:37.016 --> 08:38.475
This one's a map.

08:38.559 --> 08:39.559
Or is it?

08:40.811 --> 08:42.103
(EXHALES)

08:43.731 --> 08:46.983
How the
tables have turned !
l see you got my email.

08:48.903 --> 08:50.779
Are you
gonna give me
the leads or not?

08:50.863 --> 08:53.365
l'll give you the leads.
But you know what?

08:54.367 --> 08:56.826
lt's gonna cost you
some clerical work.

08:56.911 --> 08:59.037
What are these for?
lt doesn't matter.

08:59.121 --> 09:00.664
Fill them out.
All of them.

09:00.748 --> 09:03.083
And when you're done,
you can watch me
shred them.

09:03.167 --> 09:04.543
Right.

09:04.627 --> 09:06.503
l want to watch
The Kardashians, okay?

09:06.629 --> 09:08.296
l don't want to watch
Bored To Death.
lt's mindless!

09:08.381 --> 09:09.589
Kardashians is a good show.
lt is. . .

09:09.674 --> 09:10.715
Thank you, Stanley!
No, you don't even know!

09:10.800 --> 09:12.133
How would he even
know The Kardashians?

09:12.260 --> 09:14.553
lt's about a family,
a real-life family.
No, Stanley, do you. . .

09:14.804 --> 09:16.388
PAM: Hey, baby, what's up?

09:16.472 --> 09:19.224
l am
currently reading
incoherent riddles

09:19.308 --> 09:22.143
on blue index cards
to find vital information

09:22.228 --> 09:25.939
that Michael has hidden
all over the office.
How are you?

09:26.315 --> 09:28.942
Nothing but vomit
and diapers over here.

09:29.026 --> 09:31.069
Oh, my God.
l couldn't envy you more.

09:31.153 --> 09:34.322
Having a baby
is as exhausting
as they say it is.

09:34.657 --> 09:37.534
Having two babies,
that's just unfair.

09:38.160 --> 09:39.578
How about this one?

09:39.662 --> 09:42.289
"When arrogant salesmen
are mean to my face,

09:42.373 --> 09:45.250
"a certain manager
will go to his
moppy place."

09:45.334 --> 09:47.043
He means
his mopey place.

09:47.128 --> 09:50.005
It's under that street lamp

an office crisis
into a teachable moment.

A lesser manager
wouId have screwed
this day up royally.

10:00.349 --> 10:03.393
I can imagine some yokel
sitting behind his desk
saying,

10:03.477 --> 10:06.271
"Oh, yeah,
take a Iead.
Learn nothing."

10:06.355 --> 10:08.690
Some people shouldn't
be in this business.

10:11.068 --> 10:13.653
Hey. l guess
you probably won't
give me your leads

10:13.738 --> 10:15.322
since l'm a jerk salesman.

10:15.406 --> 10:18.033
Yeah. l basically
wish you were dead.

10:19.410 --> 10:20.619
(WHlSPERS) l hid the leads.

10:20.703 --> 10:21.870

Lower.

11:08.292 --> 11:10.335
Michael's stupid
scavenger hunt.

Michael, you were
supposed to tell me
when the leads came in.

Well, big shot, if you

Take off your dress.

No, dear God, no.

What. . .
l emptied it in the dumpster.

12:25.494 --> 12:27.662
lt had Toby's baba ghanoush.

12:28.414 --> 12:31.458
lf we don't
patronize the only
Syrian restaurant in town,

12:31.542 --> 12:35.086

but pan pizzas

Wait! Wait!

13:01.155 --> 13:04.115
Okay, you know what?
Let's just go to the
dump, start looking.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.326
Ryan, come on.
Shotgun in my car.

13:06.410 --> 13:08.244
Michael, why would
we all go to the dump?

13:08.329 --> 13:10.789
Why? Because l am
not going to call Sabre

13:10.873 --> 13:14.793
and say, "Hi ! You know
those very valuable,
expensive leads

13:14.877 --> 13:16.503

earlier today?

Not your staff, Michael. You.

13:22.092 --> 13:23.718
Well, that's not the way
it's gonna sound.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.137
Here's what we'll do.
We'll go to the dump,
we'll look around,

13:26.222 --> 13:27.931
then we'll all go
out and get pizza,

13:28.015 --> 13:30.183
maybe catch a movie,
late-night drink,

13:30.267 --> 13:31.643
some more pizza,
call it a night.
What do you. . .

13:31.727 --> 13:34.604
Does it have to be pizza?
Could we go for a falafel?

13:34.688 --> 13:35.647
Really?

13:35.731 --> 13:37.816
l'm not going.
You did this, not us.

13:37.900 --> 13:42.153
Okay, no. You encouraged it.
You were complicit. Complicit.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.030
You were all successories.

13:44.114 --> 13:46.074
That sounds fun,
mucking around
in the dump.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.534
l wish l could go.
You can.

13:47.618 --> 13:49.619
l can't.
You know that.

13:49.703 --> 13:52.080
Okay, fine, l get it.
l'll just go by myself.

13:52.498 --> 13:53.832
l'll go, Michael.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.210
'Cause you'll just
screw it up.

14:02.550 --> 14:03.800

14:11.517 --> 14:13.643
This place has gone to hell.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.816
You know,
Dwight, there was a time
you'd be pinching yourself

14:19.900 --> 14:22.777
to have the opportunity
to look through a dump
with me.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.863
Yeah, well,
the acorn becomes the oak.

14:24.947 --> 14:28.700
Yeah. Well,
sometimes the acorn
just stays an acorn.

14:28.784 --> 14:30.410
lf you don't believe me,
look in my gutters.

14:30.578 --> 14:33.246
You're adorable.
You need to go for it.

14:33.372 --> 14:36.541
l'm gonna be, like,
mad at you if you don't. . .
Yeah, whatever.

14:39.837 --> 14:41.713
(EXCLAlMS) Can't wait
for this day to be over.

14:41.797 --> 14:43.715
Why?
Just all the drama.

14:43.799 --> 14:45.174
What drama?

14:45.259 --> 14:46.759
Between the. . .

14:47.469 --> 14:49.095
Us and you guys.

14:50.472 --> 14:51.472
lt's unnecessary, right?

14:51.557 --> 14:52.557
So unnecessary.

14:52.641 --> 14:54.893
Good. Thank God you said that.

14:55.352 --> 14:56.603
You know,
maybe if the salesmen

14:56.687 --> 14:58.521
weren't acting like such
a bunch of stuck-up losers,

14:58.606 --> 15:01.983
then this day
wouldn't be so bad.
Did you ever think of that?

15:03.861 --> 15:05.862
l have new
baby pictures.

15:05.946 --> 15:07.030
Jim.

15:07.114 --> 15:08.072
(SCOFFS)

15:08.157 --> 15:11.075
Don't use
your cute baby
to make us like you.

15:11.160 --> 15:12.660
She's wearing a Onesie.

15:13.495 --> 15:14.704
Stop it.

15:17.499 --> 15:18.875
lf we act nice now,

15:18.959 --> 15:21.336
then we're
rewarding them
for treating us poorly.

15:21.420 --> 15:22.462
Didn't we kind of start it?

15:22.546 --> 15:24.297
Mmm. l think you're
remembering that wrong.

15:24.423 --> 15:25.590
ANDY: Yeah.
PHYLLlS: l don't know
about this.

15:25.674 --> 15:27.383
l mean, l think
we should hold
our ground.

15:27.468 --> 15:30.053
The company's changed, and
if they don't like it,
they can leave.

15:30.137 --> 15:33.389
l mean,
a lot of their work
can be done from lndia.

15:33.515 --> 15:35.850
Can we at least all agree
that this is uncomfortable,

15:35.935 --> 15:38.478
and maybe heading
for something bad?

15:39.021 --> 15:40.355
All those who agree
say "aye."

15:40.439 --> 15:41.522
ALL: Aye.

we need opposed.

at a 1 00K commission?

care about money?

you were a wide-eyed innocent.

nothing l can do
about my wide-set eyes.

No, no, no,
l'm talking about
your personality, Dwight!

15:58.832 --> 16:02.251
Okay, when l first met you,
l had a lot of job offers.

16:02.503 --> 16:05.797
And l had an offer
from lvan Schotsky.

16:05.881 --> 16:08.591

lf l had assistant
managed him. . .

16:08.676 --> 16:09.676

the managed him.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.469
Oh, that's low!

16:11.553 --> 16:14.055
l would be number two
right now at a Home Depot!

16:14.139 --> 16:15.139
Yeah.
Okay?

16:15.224 --> 16:16.808
'Cause they promote
from within !

You think
you would have done
better without me. Really?

16:22.147 --> 16:24.816
l hitched my wagon
to a horse with no legs.

16:24.900 --> 16:29.028
Wow! Okay! Man !

16:30.572 --> 16:32.657

about all the time

16:32.741 --> 16:35.201
that l wasted
being your friend !

been hanging out

16:39.456 --> 16:40.581
You know
what l should
have been doing?

16:40.666 --> 16:43.334
l should have
been out at bars
finding my soul mate,

16:43.419 --> 16:45.086
finding my wife,
making babies.

16:45.170 --> 16:48.172
Nice babies you're making
with the floozies at the bars!

16:48.257 --> 16:50.091
That's my wife
you're talking
about, man !

16:50.175 --> 16:53.094

who doesn't exist?

You watch it!

l would have hit you.
Don't do it! No, no.

with the wrong guy, Dwight.

That's my spool !

What's the least we can do
to make this okay?

17:33.719 --> 17:35.511
l'll text Pam.
She's really good
at this stuff.

17:35.596 --> 17:38.639
Yeah. l'll text Erin.
She's really good at
this stuff, too.

17:39.558 --> 17:42.560
l mean,
l guess we could give them
some of our new commissions.

17:42.644 --> 17:44.687
That is
a dangerous precedent.

17:44.772 --> 17:47.065
Pam texted back saying
we could give them
all iPods.

17:47.149 --> 17:50.234
lf they don't
have an iPod by now,
they really don't want one.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.862
All right.
Then we're
back to cash.

17:53.447 --> 17:54.489
And l gotta say,

17:54.573 --> 17:56.449
if giving
a small percentage
of our commissions

17:56.533 --> 17:58.534
is gonna smooth
all this over,
l'm for it.

cash it is.
