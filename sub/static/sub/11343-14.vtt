'In the criminal justice system,

00:03.078 --> 00:06.707
'sexually based offences
are considered especially heinous.

00:06.749 --> 00:10.794
'In New York City, the detectives
who investigate these vicious felonies

Hello?

00:22.931 --> 00:25.434
Hey! You left the door open!

00:30.731 --> 00:33.108
Mrs Bernstein?

00:37.613 --> 00:39.990
Oh, my God!

00:42.117 --> 00:44.703
Mrs Bernstein?

00:59.009 --> 01:02.929
- Lot of chaos for one guy.
- Lady lived here for 50 years.

01:02.971 --> 01:05.474
- Alone?
- Alone.

01:14.232 --> 01:16.735
Guy ejaculated on her thigh.

01:16.776 --> 01:20.696
Look at this.
Tied up with her own support hose.

01:21.530 --> 01:25.075
The attacker came unprepared.
The rape was an afterthought.

01:25.117 --> 01:29.496
How do you get those thoughts about
somebody who's like your grandmother?

02:19.504 --> 02:21.382
Thanks a lot.

02:23.049 --> 02:27.178
- What are you doin' with a shrink?
- Doctor. Dr Skoda.

02:27.220 --> 02:30.099
- Skoda's a handful.
- He's the best.

02:30.141 --> 02:32.643
- In his mind.
- That's what he's best at.

02:32.685 --> 02:35.354
- That's double speak.
- What double speak?

02:35.396 --> 02:39.899
- Let's just wait to call him in.
- Too late for that. I invited him.

02:39.941 --> 02:43.778
Lenora Bernstein got up,
had tea and toast as she did every morning,

02:43.821 --> 02:46.740
then filled the bird feeder
outside her window.

02:46.781 --> 02:49.160
Then crawled back in bed to warm up.

02:49.201 --> 02:53.037
Some junkie came in through the window,
tied her up, gagged her.

02:53.079 --> 02:56.083
Robbed and raped her. An old lady.

02:56.124 --> 02:58.710
- How old is old?
- 72.

02:58.751 --> 03:02.130
- Who do we notify?
- She was a widow. Only son is dead.

03:02.172 --> 03:04.841
There's gotta be somebody.

03:04.883 --> 03:10.054
This is not an address book. It's the obits.
Funeral cards in every page.

03:10.096 --> 03:13.641
As if it weren't terrifying enough
facing old age alone.

03:13.683 --> 03:18.730
I do not get it. What kind of man
rapes a little old lady?

03:18.771 --> 03:24.110
Sexually inexperienced.
Late teens, early 20s. A social misfit.

03:24.152 --> 03:27.196
If he's been employed
it's intermittent, menial.

03:27.238 --> 03:29.782
- Projected mother rage?
- That would track.

03:29.824 --> 03:33.953
- His mother may have molested him.
- No disrespect to your training.

03:33.995 --> 03:36.998
But the perp can tell us
how he felt about his mother.

03:37.039 --> 03:41.711
You canvass her street.
Munch, Jeffries, see what the ME's got.

03:41.752 --> 03:44.505
An occlusion of the anterior descending

03:44.547 --> 03:48.134
- caused a myocardial infarction.
- Brought on by the rape?

03:48.175 --> 03:52.054
Or the sudden burst of adrenaline
from that kind of trauma.

03:52.096 --> 03:55.474
- That would do it.
- But it was natural causes.

03:55.516 --> 03:59.812
Induced during the commission of
a class-A felony. That's murder two.

03:59.854 --> 04:04.942
There's vulvar bruising, no internal
abrasions. Your guy was flustered.

04:04.984 --> 04:07.903
- Overly stimulated.
- Premature ejaculator.

04:07.945 --> 04:11.282
- Can we expedite the DNA?
- 50 bucks extra.

04:11.323 --> 04:16.495
Time of death was 10:53am. How long
before did the heart attack begin?

04:16.536 --> 04:21.791
I'll have to do a dissection
of the blood vessels. I'll let you know.

04:21.834 --> 04:25.421
Did she have anything especially valuable

04:25.462 --> 04:29.508
that somebody might've known about?
Jewellery, maybe.

04:29.550 --> 04:34.513
Oh, yeah. She had some gorgeous pieces.
Diamonds set in platinum.

04:34.555 --> 04:38.392
She'd wear
that kind of jewellery around here?

04:38.434 --> 04:42.646
- To temple, sure.
- Can you describe the pieces?

04:42.688 --> 04:45.356
Yeah, in one word. Sold.

04:45.398 --> 04:47.901
She had no choice.

04:47.942 --> 04:53.114
Her jewellery box was cleaned out.
Would there have been anything left?

04:53.155 --> 04:57.953
No, nothing. Well, maybe some
costume pieces that she'd pick up

04:57.995 --> 05:02.165
at the flea markets,
but they weren't worth anything.

05:03.499 --> 05:06.628
Anybody try to pawn this
in the past few days?

05:06.670 --> 05:10.799
You can get that on QVC for 9.99.
What would I want with that?

05:10.841 --> 05:14.511
He would've had
a faux-pearl necklace, faux-onyx.

05:14.553 --> 05:18.515
I don't deal in faux. Or stolen goods.

05:18.557 --> 05:22.227
That's why
it would've stuck out in your mind.

05:22.269 --> 05:25.020
- Two kids.
- Names?

05:25.062 --> 05:27.648
If I had bought the goods,

05:27.690 --> 05:32.862
I would've gotten names and address,
as required by law. But I didn't, so I didn't.

05:32.903 --> 05:37.534
- What did they look like?
- Colombian, Dominican,

05:37.576 --> 05:41.495
somethin' like that. I don't know.
Er, late teens.

05:41.537 --> 05:45.333
One was tall,
had dark hair, wearing a fade.

05:45.375 --> 05:50.588
The other guy was really short.
He had a hand tattoo.

05:50.630 --> 05:54.092
- Of?
- Barbed wire across the fingers.

05:54.134 --> 05:56.802
And a dagger. With blood drops.

05:56.844 --> 06:00.514
Would you mind
working with our composite artist?

06:04.810 --> 06:08.398
Mr Bosic! We'd like you
to take a look at this for us.

06:08.439 --> 06:12.693
Any help you need, you come see me 24/7.
These the guys that did it?

06:12.735 --> 06:15.405
Did anybody see them in the building?

06:15.446 --> 06:17.656
Or nearby.

06:17.698 --> 06:20.618
No, but if it'd help, I'd say what you want.

06:20.660 --> 06:24.122
- We don't want that.
- It's just so horrible,

06:24.163 --> 06:28.625
what happened to that poor lady.
I feel like I didn't do enough.

06:28.667 --> 06:30.962
How about your partner?

06:31.003 --> 06:34.047
- Jimmy? He was down in the truck.
- Where was it?

06:34.089 --> 06:36.591
- Right out in front.
- Jimmy!

06:37.760 --> 06:41.721
- Take a look at these for us.
- Oh, sure. I'd be glad to.

06:41.763 --> 06:46.519
Oh, yeah! A friend of mine
does these down at Amsterdam Avenue.

06:46.561 --> 06:49.063
But these are really good.

06:49.105 --> 06:53.401
- Meaning you recognise them?
- Sure do.

06:55.027 --> 06:59.030
Excuse me.
We're tryin' to put two names on these two.

06:59.072 --> 07:03.410
That looks like Carlos.
And the other one, that's Alfonso.

07:03.451 --> 07:07.206
- Do you have a last name?
- Carlos is Medina, same as mine.

07:07.248 --> 07:11.544
No relation, thank God.
Alfonso, I'm not sure. He's new.

07:11.584 --> 07:13.962
- But you know Carlos?
- Yeah.

07:14.004 --> 07:17.966
To get to the bodega,
down that block, you pass his building.

07:18.007 --> 07:22.136
It's the one before. He sits on that stoop,
cussing everyone who goes by.

07:22.178 --> 07:24.597
- Such a pene.
- Thanks.

07:24.639 --> 07:26.558
You're welcome.

07:26.599 --> 07:29.185
Victim's synagogue is past that bodega.

07:29.227 --> 07:33.147
Every week, she would've had to
walk right past that pendejo.

07:33.189 --> 07:36.401
- Yo, whassup, ladies?
- Whassup?

07:36.443 --> 07:38.778
Mi senorita!

07:38.820 --> 07:40.988
I know you smiling!

07:43.616 --> 07:47.663
Whassup, Diego?
What's goin' on, baby? How you feel?

07:47.703 --> 07:50.123
This looks a little more promising.

07:52.500 --> 07:56.671
What I tell you about that? Give me
the money, give me the money. Break.

07:56.712 --> 07:59.298
- Bonus.
- Meet up at the block.

07:59.340 --> 08:02.843
- Police!
- Break, break, break!

08:02.885 --> 08:05.554
Right there, pal. Right there!

08:05.596 --> 08:10.101
Hey! Where you goin'?
Against the fence. Against the fence.

08:12.561 --> 08:16.691
- Hey, out of my pocket, man!
- Soon as I hit bottom.

08:16.732 --> 08:22.571
I found Hoffa. What's this?
This poor dear retains water in her ankles.

08:22.613 --> 08:26.325
- You scored a diuretic, genius.
- What?

08:26.367 --> 08:29.537
You won't get high,
but will shed unsightly pounds.

08:29.578 --> 08:32.039
Me has embaucado, you douche!

08:32.081 --> 08:35.501
You want us to Mirandise you
in English and Spanish, we can.

08:35.543 --> 08:37.626
What have we got?

08:37.669 --> 08:39.712
Bernstein, Lenora.

08:39.755 --> 08:43.549
You know Lenora? Let's go talk about it.

08:43.591 --> 08:45.928
Don't say nothing. No dice nada.

08:49.722 --> 08:54.018
Can we get you somethin' to drink?
You probably want to get this over.

08:54.060 --> 08:58.107
Good. Let's make it quick and painless.
Have a seat.

09:01.402 --> 09:04.278
- Just tell us what happened.
- Ask Carlos.

09:04.320 --> 09:06.323
We're askin' you.

09:07.865 --> 09:11.369
What is it? You got a thing for
defenceless old ladies?

09:11.411 --> 09:15.791
- The kind with fancy jewellery?
- You climbed up her fire escape.

09:15.832 --> 09:19.544
You're thinkin',
'My lucky day. The window's not locked.'

09:19.586 --> 09:23.006
You go in, tie her up, and you find squat.

09:23.048 --> 09:26.801
- Why don't you talk to Carlos?
- She says she sold her jewellery.

09:26.842 --> 09:30.096
- Which is true.
- But you don't believe her.

09:30.137 --> 09:33.058
- You're pissed, take it out on her.
- What?

09:33.100 --> 09:35.602
You look nervous to me, Alfonso.

09:38.188 --> 09:40.564
Why is that?

09:44.277 --> 09:47.864
- You the one who raped her?
- That's sick!

09:47.906 --> 09:50.617
I didn't rape no old lady!

09:50.659 --> 09:54.746
I'll tell you what,
we'll talk to Carlos about that.

10:00.542 --> 10:03.128
We disturbin' your beauty sleep?

10:03.170 --> 10:05.756
Don't worry about it.

10:06.590 --> 10:08.842
- Nice ink.
- I know.

10:08.884 --> 10:11.888
The guy you tried to unload
the jewellery on loved it.

10:11.930 --> 10:16.434
- We found that stuff on the street.
- Your prints were in her apartment.

10:17.518 --> 10:21.356
- Helped her with the groceries.
- Through the window?

10:21.397 --> 10:26.611
I could be wrong, but Good Samaritans
don't usually rape elderly women.

10:26.653 --> 10:31.032
- What did you say?
- We got DNA from your donation.

10:31.074 --> 10:35.286
You don't tell us
which one of you did it, it will.

10:35.328 --> 10:39.247
We're gonna take samples from both of you.

10:45.128 --> 10:47.756
Well, let's do it.

10:47.798 --> 10:50.634
Cos I didn't rape nobody.

10:56.473 --> 11:00.311
You were right.
Carlos cleared up everything.

11:00.352 --> 11:04.064
- So, I can go now?
- Why'd you do it?

11:04.105 --> 11:07.651
- What was goin' through your head?
- What?

11:07.692 --> 11:10.946
Your buddy has no problem
givin' us a DNA sample.

11:10.987 --> 11:14.157
Which makes it obvious you did the rape.

11:14.199 --> 11:17.410
- That led to a heart attack.
- That killed her.

11:17.453 --> 11:19.788
- Same as puttin' a bullet in her.
- No!

11:19.829 --> 11:22.415
- Yes.
- I don't understand.

11:22.457 --> 11:25.252
I didn't do anything like that!

11:25.293 --> 11:31.508
- He says he didn't do it.
- If he didn't, he'll consent to a DNA test.

11:31.549 --> 11:34.552
I don't got a problem with that.

11:40.726 --> 11:43.186
What's wrong?

11:43.228 --> 11:46.022
- We swabbed them and sent it out.
- And?

11:46.064 --> 11:48.983
- I don't think either will match.
- Why?

11:49.025 --> 11:52.153
- Too anxious.
- Falling over themselves to give it up.

11:52.195 --> 11:56.324
- One of 'em's playin' you, right?
- Or there's a third perp.

12:01.371 --> 12:05.208
I'm arraigning two boys.
Who the hell is this John Doe?

12:05.249 --> 12:08.461
The DNA came back.
It's neither of the boys we have.

12:08.503 --> 12:11.755
We have them on ripping the place off.
Not rape.

12:11.797 --> 12:15.384
What's this?
A fishing expedition for John Doe three?

12:15.426 --> 12:19.013
Exactly. We're not robbery.
We want the one who raped her.

12:19.055 --> 12:21.974
I wish you'd let me know
one was still at large.

12:22.016 --> 12:24.435
We thought there were just two.

12:24.477 --> 12:28.104
- Only two went to the pawn shop.
- Two seen at the building.

12:28.814 --> 12:32.693
- What about the guy they sold to?
- Who, Hiphop? Nothin'.

12:32.735 --> 12:36.280
So the smart one got away clean.
What do you want me to do?

12:36.322 --> 12:41.369
The boys won't give up any names.
Can you give us a bargaining chip?

12:41.410 --> 12:46.415
I can charge them with robbery one,
robbery two, and lesser charges.

12:46.457 --> 12:50.920
- If they give us what we want?
- Robbery two and criminal trespass.

12:50.961 --> 12:54.881
They're looking at five
instead of fifteen. I won't go lower.

12:55.632 --> 12:59.428
- Screw you, I ain't doin' five.
- Let us do the negotiating.

12:59.470 --> 13:03.514
If your client doesn't take the deal,
he's looking at 15.

13:03.556 --> 13:06.851
- Give us some time alone.
- I don't need time.

13:06.893 --> 13:09.813
They want the rapist. I want a free skate.

13:09.855 --> 13:14.567
This is serious jail time.
I don't think you're the gambler Carlos is.

13:14.609 --> 13:17.195
- Maybe we should.
- Shut up.

13:17.236 --> 13:20.407
I got us covered.
We're not the ones they want.

13:20.449 --> 13:26.121
Why are you letting this boy gamble
with your life? How old are you? 17?

13:26.163 --> 13:30.375
Take a good look at me.
In 15 years, you're gonna be as old as I am.

13:30.417 --> 13:32.961
Oh, please! Can we be serious here?

13:33.003 --> 13:38.342
If we get this guy on our own,
the deal is off. You'll both do the max.

13:38.383 --> 13:42.345
- And we will find him.
- Oh, knock yourself out.

13:44.181 --> 13:46.892
Enjoy the cavity search.

13:51.313 --> 13:54.649
We need Carlos Medina
and Alfonso Cardenas's files.

13:54.691 --> 13:57.068
To confirm they ditched school on the 14th.

13:57.109 --> 14:00.529
- Do you have a warrant?
- Could by the end of the day.

14:00.572 --> 14:02.990
Good enough.

14:04.910 --> 14:07.870
Actually, they did not skip school
on the 14th.

14:07.912 --> 14:10.664
- No?
- No. They were already suspended.

14:10.706 --> 14:12.959
- What they do?
- Broke into lockers.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.795
- Were they caught with another guy?
- No, just those two.

14:16.837 --> 14:20.550
Can you tell us who they hang with?
Who they get in trouble with?

14:23.844 --> 14:27.681
- You have someone in mind?
- For him, I'll wait on the warrant.

14:27.723 --> 14:30.601
Is he the principal's son or something?

14:31.686 --> 14:36.066
He and Carlos have history,
but I don't think they associate any more.

14:36.107 --> 14:38.358
His name?

14:38.400 --> 14:41.570
He cleaned up his act.
He's not who you want.

14:41.612 --> 14:45.240
- That's for us to decide.
- Emmanuel Clementa.

14:45.282 --> 14:49.119
While you look up his address,
check if he was in school on the 14th.

15:00.256 --> 15:05.218
Sneak it in, sneak it back out.
That your modus operandi, Emmanuel?

15:05.260 --> 15:08.346
Got two of your team-mates in jail.

15:08.388 --> 15:12.226
Carlos and Alfonso
aren't on my baseball team.

15:12.268 --> 15:16.271
How did you leave Mrs Bernstein's
apartment without anyone seein' you?

15:16.313 --> 15:18.648
By not being there.

15:21.109 --> 15:24.571
It's interesting
the effect guilt has on our bodies.

15:24.613 --> 15:26.781
- Yes.
- I have no guilt.

15:26.823 --> 15:30.493
- Sociopaths never do.
- I have no reason to feel guilty.

15:30.535 --> 15:34.623
An old woman is dead. She was raped.
You and Carlos used to hassle her.

15:34.665 --> 15:39.711
I haven't hung out with Carlos in a year.
Anyway, she gave us quarters.

15:39.753 --> 15:43.256
- So, for a buck, she'd be alive?
- Why you say that?

15:43.299 --> 15:47.510
It must've been insultin',
a white lady tossin' coins at you.

15:47.552 --> 15:51.306
- I'd be insulted.
- Yeah. We were like, 'Keep it.'

15:51.347 --> 15:55.226
- So, it was payback?
- Not for me. I got discipline.

15:55.268 --> 15:58.897
The discipline you had
when you ditched school that day?

15:58.938 --> 16:01.482
- I had things to do.
- Like?

16:02.775 --> 16:05.445
Tell us, or you can tell the judge.

16:06.779 --> 16:10.742
My little sister got in over her head,
if you know what I'm sayin'.

16:10.783 --> 16:13.077
No.

16:13.119 --> 16:15.913
I took her to the methadone clinic that day.

16:15.955 --> 16:18.665
My! Another Good Samaritan!

16:20.626 --> 16:24.505
Well, thanks for your help.
I am tapped out. How about you?

16:24.547 --> 16:28.217
Nada. And look who's empty-handed.

16:28.259 --> 16:32.013
St Emmanuel was at the methadone clinic
from 8am to 11:45.

16:32.054 --> 16:36.517
The receptionist saw him come in
at 9:00 and stay at least two hours.

16:36.559 --> 16:38.895
- He left and came back?
- No.

16:38.936 --> 16:41.480
She discussed baseball stats with him.

16:41.522 --> 16:44.191
Which drove the administrating nurse nuts.

16:44.233 --> 16:46.527
Baseball widow.

16:46.569 --> 16:50.405
- So, how close are we?
- We got sent back to square one.

16:50.447 --> 16:53.284
We'll have to give the boys a better offer.

16:53.326 --> 16:56.619
- ADA won't go lower than five.
- For both.

16:56.661 --> 17:00.166
- What if one does the max?
- The other walks?

17:00.207 --> 17:05.378
- I want the rapist. Any thoughts?
- Carlos is your typical sociopath.

17:05.421 --> 17:09.758
- He'll screw Alfonso.
- Give it to the sociopath?

17:09.800 --> 17:13.761
Alfonso's a follower. His loyalty
to Carlos makes him hard to turn.

17:13.803 --> 17:16.640
But he has a conscience and he's scared.

17:16.682 --> 17:20.185
Fear is a great motivator. Let's use it.

17:23.146 --> 17:25.690
Enjoying your stay?

17:25.732 --> 17:29.653
- Makin' friends, I see.
- I'm here to check on his welfare.

17:29.695 --> 17:32.156
He isn't doing well in here.

17:32.197 --> 17:35.199
How are you gonna handle 15 years?

17:35.241 --> 17:38.077
- Carlos says that won't happen.
- Carlos.

17:38.120 --> 17:40.831
Keep listening to Carlos, you'll end up dead.

17:40.873 --> 17:43.958
- Your point?
- We talked to the DA.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.547
He gives us the rapist,
the DA will drop him to third-degree robbery.

17:48.589 --> 17:52.801
They can sentence you as a youth at 17.
You can pull a year and a half.

17:52.843 --> 17:55.554
- Maybe even probation.
- No jail time.

17:55.596 --> 17:58.514
- It's possible.
- Will Carlos get it, too?

17:58.556 --> 18:01.685
No. Only one of you.

18:09.066 --> 18:11.778
Can I think about it?

18:11.820 --> 18:14.448
What is there is to think about?

18:14.489 --> 18:17.075
This is a once-in-a-lifetime offer.

18:20.870 --> 18:23.874
You wanna think about it? You got 12 hours.

18:23.915 --> 18:28.627
Think very hard, because
this is the biggest decision of your life.

18:30.629 --> 18:34.675
- Then it goes to Carlos.
- He's gonna take it in a heartbeat.

18:38.095 --> 18:40.473
- Any messages?
- Not about Alfonso.

18:40.514 --> 18:42.224
- Idiot.
- He won't deal?

18:42.266 --> 18:44.852
- He wants it.
- But he won't screw Carlos.

18:44.893 --> 18:47.730
- Carlos'd sell his mom for smokes.
- Yep.

18:47.771 --> 18:51.734
DA's office called. You got a taker.
They're waiting for you.

18:55.404 --> 18:57.906
What are you doin' here?

18:57.948 --> 19:00.659
- I heard there's a deal.
- On Alfonso's table.

19:00.701 --> 19:03.287
Alfonso had a dilemma.

19:03.328 --> 19:06.999
He asked for my advice
and I had to counsel him against it.

19:07.041 --> 19:11.379
My client is quite amenable to the terms.

19:11.421 --> 19:14.089
- Shall we begin?
- It's up to you.

19:15.090 --> 19:17.217
Yeah.

19:17.259 --> 19:22.097
The deal's contingent upon
your information leading to an arrest.

19:22.139 --> 19:25.184
And he allocutes.

19:25.225 --> 19:28.228
What?

19:28.270 --> 19:30.522
Oh!

19:30.564 --> 19:34.359
I got no problem telling what happened.
Where should I start?

19:34.401 --> 19:37.195
- Where we came through the window?
- Who's we?

19:37.238 --> 19:40.782
Alfonso, I thought,
was gonna bail right there.

19:40.866 --> 19:44.703
- What about the other guy?
- She has nothin'. I trash the place.

19:44.744 --> 19:49.874
I teach that bitch.
But all of a sudden, there's this noise.

19:49.916 --> 19:53.503
- What kind of noise?
- A cuckoo clock.

19:53.545 --> 19:55.839
Only it's freaky loud.

19:55.880 --> 19:59.384
Alfonso almost fills his drawers.
He takes off.

19:59.426 --> 20:02.012
- How many times did it cuckoo?
- Once.

20:02.053 --> 20:05.807
- Once on the half hour. 9:30.
- So, I chase down Alfonso.

20:05.849 --> 20:10.228
- He's on the stairs.
- You leave the other guy with her?

20:10.270 --> 20:13.690
- I didn't leave nobody.
- Let me explain something.

20:13.731 --> 20:17.527
You jerk us around,
you jerk your deal off the table.

20:18.695 --> 20:21.447
So I drag Alfonso's sorry ass back.

20:21.489 --> 20:27.286
But there's a guy outside the door.
A white guy. Beige uniform.

20:27.328 --> 20:31.207
Just hold on right here.
You're saying none of you raped her.

20:31.249 --> 20:33.543
The guy was carrying a clipboard.

20:33.584 --> 20:37.629
Had a logo on his pocket
with letters that didn't spell anything.

20:37.672 --> 20:41.426
Anyways, this guy
walks through the door we left open.

20:41.467 --> 20:45.054
Alfonso was like,
'We trashed the place, we need to go.'

20:45.096 --> 20:48.933
- The delivery man raped her?
- Yeah.

20:48.975 --> 20:51.894
I mean, how sick is that? Huh?

20:55.898 --> 20:58.568
- The delivery guy?
- So Carlos said.

20:58.609 --> 21:02.529
Not a delinquent buddy,
but a good citizen? Yeah, right.

21:02.571 --> 21:07.493
- Carlos described his uniform.
- There are holes in Stan's story.

21:07.535 --> 21:11.580
He went in at 9:30,
but Stan didn't call 911 for 23 minutes.

21:11.622 --> 21:15.209
- What can you do in 23 minutes?
- What can't you do?

21:15.251 --> 21:19.296
He called it in and stayed there
while EMS tried to resuscitate.

21:19.338 --> 21:23.759
Guy starts a fire, reports it,
helps put it out. Hero syndrome.

21:23.801 --> 21:28.304
Or Carlos takes a hero and turns him
into the patsy. Schmuck syndrome.

21:28.346 --> 21:32.351
The elderly victim, the hurried sex act,

21:32.393 --> 21:36.062
- it points to a less mature guy.
- Like a Carlos.

21:36.104 --> 21:40.441
We have to tread lightly here, folks.
I mean, Stan made every paper.

21:40.483 --> 21:43.861
We don't want another
Richard Jewell on our hands.

21:43.903 --> 21:46.240
So check him out thoroughly.

21:46.907 --> 21:50.118
- What's wrong with you two?
- Alfonso's attorney called.

21:50.159 --> 21:52.495
- Now he wants to deal.
- Desperately.

21:52.537 --> 21:56.624
He's not the only one with troubles.
I got Stan's record.

21:56.666 --> 21:58.751
Stan has a record?

21:58.794 --> 22:01.838
Mm-hm. He spent some time in Sing Sing.

22:01.879 --> 22:03.965
- What for?
- Armed robbery.

22:04.007 --> 22:06.968
- Sexual assaults?
- None that he was busted for.

22:07.009 --> 22:12.473
If he did, he had to tell. And cell mates?
Great captive audiences.

22:12.515 --> 22:15.184
- Who did he bunk with?
- Jonathan Schmidt.

22:15.227 --> 22:17.395
- In or out?
- Out.

22:21.607 --> 22:24.861
Yeah, I remember Stan.
Talk about hard time.

22:24.903 --> 22:27.989
He rubbed you the wrong way, huh?

22:28.030 --> 22:32.785
Havin' skin peeled off would've been
more pleasurable. Cat never shut up.

22:32.827 --> 22:35.287
About what? Crimes he got away with?

22:35.329 --> 22:39.875
Nothin' to do with that.
Couldn't walk five feet to the trash can?

22:39.917 --> 22:44.338
- So, what he talk about?
- Female exploits, what else?

22:44.380 --> 22:48.592
He was the joke of the cell block.
Stan the Man, they called him.

22:48.634 --> 22:50.720
You stay in touch?

22:50.761 --> 22:53.181
He called me a couple months ago.

22:53.223 --> 22:55.266
And?

22:55.307 --> 22:57.519
And he goes on and on

22:57.561 --> 23:01.730
about this cush job he has
in pharmaceutical transportation.

23:01.772 --> 23:05.360
And how he's boffin'
half the women on his round.

23:05.401 --> 23:08.654
He told you he was having sex
with women he was delivering to?

23:08.696 --> 23:12.700
If you let him tell it,
no woman could resist him.

23:19.164 --> 23:22.251
- 'Jimmy, isn't it?'
- Yeah! Who are you?

23:22.292 --> 23:25.170
Detectives Jeffries and Munch.
You going to work?

23:25.212 --> 23:27.047
Yeah. I have to be there by 9:00.

23:27.089 --> 23:31.009
I understand it's enjoyable work.
For Stan, at least.

23:31.051 --> 23:34.763
- Stan the Man.
- We heard he was irresistible.

23:34.805 --> 23:38.016
We also heard he's boffin'
half the women on the route.

23:38.058 --> 23:39.351
Really?

23:39.393 --> 23:43.772
If you know anything, tell us,
or we'll charge you with obstruction.

23:43.814 --> 23:45.399
What do you wanna know?

23:45.440 --> 23:50.654
You two in that truck all day,
Stan the talker, I'm sure sex comes up.

23:50.695 --> 23:52.447
Oh! Yeah!

23:52.489 --> 23:55.867
He ever talk about having sex
with women you deliver to?

23:55.909 --> 23:59.412
All the time.
Special deliveries, he calls them.

23:59.454 --> 24:02.206
What about Mrs Bernstein?

24:02.249 --> 24:06.336
- What about her?
- He make a special delivery to her?

24:07.420 --> 24:10.340
Nope. I have to... pick up a newspaper.

24:11.841 --> 24:14.218
Think he knows more than he's telling us?

24:14.260 --> 24:18.555
Volumes. Think it's time
we talked to 't.e man' himself.

24:20.850 --> 24:25.437
- Hey! What brings you down here?
- We need to clear up a few things.

24:25.479 --> 24:27.440
Anything I can do to help.

24:27.482 --> 24:30.026
It'd be easier if we did this at the station.

24:30.068 --> 24:35.073
- I still got deliveries to make.
- They can wait.

24:37.867 --> 24:42.080
For the last time, I never did any customers.
Not once, never.

24:42.121 --> 24:45.416
- That's not what we heard.
- I brag, all right?

24:45.458 --> 24:47.876
- Huh!
- OK, lie.

24:47.918 --> 24:51.047
- Like on your job application?
- About being an ex-con.

24:51.089 --> 24:53.006
They wouldn't have hired me.

24:53.048 --> 24:55.426
And when they find out about
Mrs Bernstein?

24:55.468 --> 24:58.429
- I never touched her!
- How did you give her CPR?

24:58.471 --> 25:00.598
How...?

25:02.016 --> 25:05.561
OK. OK. I didn't. I didn't give her CPR.

25:05.603 --> 25:09.941
- I didn't even find her.
- There you go with the lies again.

25:09.982 --> 25:13.903
Witnesses saw you go in
20 minutes before you said.

25:13.945 --> 25:17.490
No, no. You got it wrong.
They didn't see me, they saw Jimmy.

25:17.532 --> 25:20.368
You want us to believe
you're covering for Jimmy?

25:20.409 --> 25:24.247
Not for him, for me. OK, look.

25:24.288 --> 25:29.460
I'm supposed to make the deliveries.
He's not certified to hook up tanks.

25:29.502 --> 25:33.297
When there's a building without elevators,
he walks it up for me.

25:35.965 --> 25:41.096
He was takin' so long, I went up.
I found the new tank by the door,

25:41.137 --> 25:43.557
her tied to the bed
and Jimmy in the bathroom.

25:43.599 --> 25:46.018
- What was he doing?
- Freaking out.

25:46.060 --> 25:49.563
I figured he walked in on
what I did, couldn't cope.

25:49.605 --> 25:50.772
But you could.

25:50.814 --> 25:56.195
It seemed like a win-win. He doesn't
have to deal with it, I keep my job,

25:56.237 --> 25:59.364
and it gets my name in the papers.

26:02.284 --> 26:05.662
- I'm not lyin' this time.
- No?

26:05.704 --> 26:07.539
No.

26:07.581 --> 26:10.209
We've got witnesses. We can clear it up.

26:10.250 --> 26:13.294
We'll put you both in the line-up
and see who saw what.

26:27.058 --> 26:29.144
Carlos, do you recognise anyone?

26:30.896 --> 26:33.648
- No.
- Take your time.

26:33.689 --> 26:37.193
I don't need it! He's not there!
What y'all playin'?

26:39.363 --> 26:42.323
- All right, send in the next group.
- What's with you?

26:42.365 --> 26:46.535
I told you exactly who it was.
And he ain't there...

26:46.577 --> 26:48.663
- That's him!
- Which one?

26:48.704 --> 26:53.000
Number one. Gilligan's Island dude.
That's the dopey face I saw.

26:53.042 --> 26:55.628
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Can I go?

26:55.669 --> 26:59.381
- My client's fulfilled the deal.
- Only if it leads to an arrest.

26:59.423 --> 27:01.885
I'll send over the paperwork when it does.

27:10.601 --> 27:15.272
Just got the final autopsy report.
She had two separate heart attacks.

27:15.314 --> 27:18.859
The first one caused a partial occlusion
in a diagonal branch.

27:18.901 --> 27:22.363
- When did she have the first one?
- Within an hour of the fatal one.

27:22.404 --> 27:24.365
When the kids broke in.

27:24.406 --> 27:27.242
Did the first contribute to the second?

27:27.284 --> 27:32.206
The ME says if it hadn't weakened
her heart, she might have survived.

27:32.247 --> 27:36.043
- We cut Carlos loose.
- Let's not lose anyone else.

27:39.588 --> 27:42.340
- You understand your rights?
- Yeah.

27:42.382 --> 27:45.302
Who brought the tank
up to Mrs Bernstein, you or Stan?

27:45.344 --> 27:48.764
Me. I always took the tanks.
Stan has a bad back.

27:48.805 --> 27:53.727
- Was the door open or closed?
- Open. But not all the way.

27:53.769 --> 27:57.356
- Just a little bit. But it was open.
- Mm-hm.

27:57.397 --> 27:59.691
- So what did you do then?
- I went in.

28:00.859 --> 28:04.571
- You notice anything unusual?
- Oh... yeah. Yeah.

28:04.613 --> 28:07.657
- It didn't look like it usually did.
- How did it look?

28:07.699 --> 28:10.785
Ooh... Messy.

28:10.826 --> 28:12.913
- Messy?
- Yeah.

28:12.954 --> 28:15.039
- That it?
- Yeah.

28:15.081 --> 28:19.544
- I was gonna help.
- Help what? Help her clean up?

28:19.586 --> 28:23.798
Yeah. I called, 'Hey, Mrs Bernstein!'

28:23.840 --> 28:27.134
- She answer?
- No. So I went lookin' for her.

28:28.928 --> 28:31.388
Where'd you find her?

28:32.557 --> 28:34.892
- B-Bedroom.
- Where in the bedroom?

28:34.934 --> 28:37.020
On the bed.

28:38.063 --> 28:40.440
Anyone else there?

28:40.482 --> 28:42.525
No.

28:43.567 --> 28:47.322
Can you describe the condition
in which you found her?

28:47.364 --> 28:49.199
I... What was that?

28:49.240 --> 28:52.159
How did she look on the bed?

28:53.203 --> 28:55.830
Er... she looked...

28:55.872 --> 29:01.294
She looked nice. She was...
She was wearing her nightie.

29:02.628 --> 29:05.673
She looked happy to see me.

29:05.715 --> 29:08.801
- That when you tied her up?
- N-No! I didn't tie her up.

29:08.843 --> 29:14.182
I gotta tell you, we think you did,
and we also think you raped her.

29:14.223 --> 29:17.059
- You raped an old woman!
- Then you killed her.

29:17.100 --> 29:18.769
No!

29:25.985 --> 29:28.153
You wanted to see me?

29:28.195 --> 29:30.864
Yeah, shut the door, please.

29:32.950 --> 29:36.161
You wrote a psych evaluation
on Jimmy Walp.

29:36.203 --> 29:38.372
No, actually, I didn't.

29:38.414 --> 29:40.708
According to his attorney, you did.

29:40.750 --> 29:46.088
If he proves Jimmy didn't understand
his Miranda, we lose his statement.

29:46.130 --> 29:47.798
And anything that came after.

29:47.840 --> 29:52.011
How could you give them
that ammunition in writing? I asked...

29:52.053 --> 29:57.599
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I put a sticky
on your desk by his DD5, that's all.

29:57.640 --> 30:02.645
- What was on this bombshell sticky?
- 'Retarded' and a question mark.

30:02.687 --> 30:05.565
- Never should've left this office.
- Well, it did.

30:05.607 --> 30:08.151
It made it into the discovery packet.

30:08.193 --> 30:10.905
The hearing is Monday.
Anything you can dig up

30:10.946 --> 30:14.741
refuting his alleged retardation
would be greatly appreciated.

30:16.994 --> 30:22.415
Well, let's start digging and not stop
until we get this guy in Mensa.

30:24.375 --> 30:28.338
- Pulled his Board of Ed records.
- According to the DSM criteria,

30:28.379 --> 30:31.675
an IQ of 70 or below classifies him
as retarded. What's his?

30:31.717 --> 30:33.801
- He hasn't got one.
- It's not there?

30:33.843 --> 30:36.596
- He was never tested.
- Everybody's tested.

30:36.637 --> 30:38.806
He missed a lot of school.

30:38.848 --> 30:41.851
- What about his grades?
- Ds and Fs.

30:41.893 --> 30:45.646
That doesn't prove anything.
Einstein consistently flunked math.

30:45.688 --> 30:50.526
We'll argue he's another Einstein.
What about his work history?

30:50.569 --> 30:54.405
He was even fired from McDonalds.
That alone'll win their case.

30:54.447 --> 30:58.659
But he got jobs. He lived on his own,
unsupervised, unassisted.

30:58.701 --> 31:00.786
Which, believe me, is no easy feat.

31:00.828 --> 31:05.166
Jimmy? He's no trouble.
You're not here about that guy in 201?

31:05.207 --> 31:07.293
We're sure.

31:12.298 --> 31:15.926
- We'll lock up when we leave.
- Whoa, a lot of books.

31:16.844 --> 31:20.681
Got everything from, er, Danielle Steel to...

31:20.723 --> 31:25.144
Look at this.
Introduction To Thermonuclear Physics.

31:25.186 --> 31:30.399
This is such a crock. Tell me, how
many retarded guys read James Joyce?

31:30.482 --> 31:33.068
- In the box.
- He's a big reader.

31:33.110 --> 31:35.946
- Sits outside readin' the paper.
- Is that right?

31:35.988 --> 31:39.783
I say, 'What's the good news?'
He says, 'Tell you when I find it.'

31:39.825 --> 31:44.622
Look. Guy's kept every receipt
he ever got, all paid with cash.

31:44.663 --> 31:47.583
Cash. Cash. No credit cards.

31:47.624 --> 31:53.047
- That makes him smarter than me.
- No chequebook. No diary.

31:53.088 --> 31:56.467
- But he's got a lot of porn.
- In the box.

31:58.343 --> 32:00.428
There's no kitchen here.

32:00.471 --> 32:03.307
We got a stove. What do you know?
Filled with books.

32:03.348 --> 32:08.020
- And newspapers. Where does he eat?
- Lilly's Diner. Religiously.

32:08.061 --> 32:13.066
Health Department closed it down
for a week, I think he lost 10lbs.

32:13.108 --> 32:17.988
He's a regular. Comes in twice a day,
three times on the weekend.

32:18.030 --> 32:21.073
- Alone?
- Always. Which is odd,

32:21.115 --> 32:25.411
because he's a friendly guy.
He talks to whoever's beside him.

32:25.453 --> 32:28.999
He come across to you as... slow?

32:29.041 --> 32:33.587
He ain't in any hurry.
He studies the menu. Drives me nuts.

32:33.628 --> 32:37.174
- Why?
- Because he always gets the special.

32:37.215 --> 32:42.220
Every time. Er, 'scuse me. Guy over
on table two's gonna have a coronary

32:42.262 --> 32:44.181
if he doesn't get a coffee.

32:45.264 --> 32:49.269
Isn't it interesting how
not one person he dealt with daily

32:49.311 --> 32:52.647
picked up on
any developmental disabilities?

32:52.689 --> 32:55.691
Of course, they had limited contact with him.

32:59.654 --> 33:01.823
No. He was never any trouble.

33:01.865 --> 33:03.950
What was he like as a child?

33:03.992 --> 33:09.038
Er... You know, I had seven.
Jimmy was the sixth.

33:09.080 --> 33:12.791
I remember I could sit him in front of the TV

33:12.833 --> 33:16.754
and not have to worry about him for hours.

33:16.796 --> 33:20.465
It's hard to give each kid
the attention they deserve.

33:20.507 --> 33:22.886
Maybe he didn't get enough,

33:22.926 --> 33:27.724
but, er, when I had him,
I was just so tired.

33:27.765 --> 33:30.851
Jimmy missed a lot of school.
Why was that?

33:30.892 --> 33:36.773
He was usually an angel, but he had
bad days and I had to keep him home.

33:36.815 --> 33:39.068
Did you think of getting him tested?

33:39.110 --> 33:41.153
For what?

33:41.194 --> 33:43.448
Learning disorders.

33:43.489 --> 33:48.536
He isn't retarded. I'm his mother.
I would know something like that.

33:49.619 --> 33:52.832
- When did you last speak with him?
- It's been a while.

33:52.874 --> 33:56.501
Er, I guess it was when he left home.

33:56.543 --> 34:01.923
- You mean, when he was 18?
- Maybe I'm not the best mother,

34:01.965 --> 34:06.554
but you don't know what it's like
raising seven children by myself.

34:06.596 --> 34:09.098
Did Jimmy ever have any girlfriends?

34:09.139 --> 34:12.141
No. He never had much luck in that area.

34:12.183 --> 34:14.520
How about friends?

34:14.561 --> 34:16.856
No.

34:17.898 --> 34:20.567
Defence gave him an IQ test.
I got the results.

34:20.608 --> 34:23.194
- Yea or nay?
- He just missed the cut. 68.

34:23.235 --> 34:27.072
It wouldn't be in his best interests
to try hard.

34:27.114 --> 34:31.744
It's odd. Nothing has his writing on.
Not even a grocery list.

34:31.786 --> 34:34.581
Interesting, but not as interesting as this.

34:34.621 --> 34:38.251
Insatiable Bondage Sluts. That's nice.

34:39.543 --> 34:43.505
Charming, but not illegal,
and certainly not admissible in court.

34:43.547 --> 34:45.632
Mm-hm. Turn it over.

34:47.802 --> 34:50.388
Wow. Eerily familiar, huh?

34:50.429 --> 34:53.599
Same staging as Mrs Bernstein,
down to the shade of pink.

34:53.641 --> 34:56.686
- Except the 50-year age gap.
- He didn't stage it.

34:56.728 --> 35:01.023
Carlos and Alfonso tied her up.
That's how Jimmy found her.

35:01.065 --> 35:02.734
- How's it goin'?
- Great.

35:02.775 --> 35:05.069
- Hey.
- What have we found?

35:05.111 --> 35:09.323
Jimmy Walp's belongings.
What do you make of that?

35:10.409 --> 35:15.288
He walked into that room,
saw a tableau from this tape, got excited.

35:15.329 --> 35:19.333
- And committed a felony.
- He misreads social cues

35:19.375 --> 35:21.711
and mimics to appear normal.

35:21.752 --> 35:25.214
He may have thought
he was expected to perform the sex act.

35:25.256 --> 35:27.800
Whose side are you on?

35:27.842 --> 35:32.221
I think we all wanna see justice done.
He needs to be incarcerated.

35:32.263 --> 35:34.348
The question is where.

35:34.390 --> 35:39.770
They do send the mentally retarded to
prison. There are 250 on Death Row.

35:39.812 --> 35:43.941
The system is slanted against them.
They tend to incriminate themselves,

35:43.982 --> 35:46.485
they're unable to assist in their own defence.

35:46.527 --> 35:50.364
They're so eager to please,
they confess to things they didn't do.

35:50.406 --> 35:52.449
Jimmy is mildly retarded.

35:52.491 --> 35:55.828
He did not understand
the consequences of his actions.

35:55.869 --> 35:58.372
OK. That it? Finished here?

35:58.414 --> 36:02.501
Jimmy Walp went his entire life
without being diagnosed, until now.

36:02.543 --> 36:04.669
I find that awfully convenient.

36:04.711 --> 36:08.340
- I find it tragic.
- We're going ahead with this.

36:08.382 --> 36:11.218
He understands enough to be accountable.

36:11.260 --> 36:15.514
He knows he did something wrong.
We are not losing his statement.

36:22.980 --> 36:25.649
He maintained a job and an apartment.

36:25.691 --> 36:30.737
Our investigation turned up no records
diagnosing him as mentally retarded.

36:30.779 --> 36:33.657
We found no conclusive evidence
indicating he is.

36:33.699 --> 36:35.993
Thank you, Detective.

36:36.034 --> 36:41.747
Detective, books from my client's
residence were entered into evidence.

36:41.789 --> 36:45.042
You tried to cite them
as proof of his reading ability.

36:45.084 --> 36:49.965
Do you know the lengths
the mentally retarded will go to disguise it?

36:50.006 --> 36:52.592
They'll pretend to read in public,

36:52.634 --> 36:58.889
parrot phrases to appear knowledgeable,
wear a watch when they can't tell time.

36:58.931 --> 37:03.895
My client spent his life fooling people
into believing he is of normal intelligence.

37:03.937 --> 37:08.024
- Is there a question here?
- Your question, Mr Trask.

37:08.066 --> 37:13.612
- Did you ask Jimmy to read out loud?
- I found no reason to do that.

37:13.654 --> 37:17.908
But you showed him his Miranda,
and asked him to read it before signing?

37:17.950 --> 37:20.619
- Yes, but I also read it to him.
- Jimmy.

37:21.705 --> 37:25.375
Do you remember talking to
Detective Stabler on March 21st?

37:25.417 --> 37:28.168
- Yep.
- Did he explain your rights to you?

37:28.210 --> 37:29.629
Yep.

37:29.671 --> 37:32.631
Can you explain what your rights are?

37:34.843 --> 37:38.595
Yeah. You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say...

37:38.637 --> 37:41.849
can and will be held against you
in a court of law.

37:41.890 --> 37:45.519
Very good.
Now, can you explain what it means?

37:47.896 --> 37:51.859
- Those are your rights.
- But can you explain them?

37:53.528 --> 37:56.029
- I just did.
- OK.

37:57.614 --> 38:00.909
What is a court of law?

38:01.952 --> 38:04.246
Due process?

38:06.164 --> 38:09.876
What is the role of the judge?

38:18.426 --> 38:20.846
No further questions.

38:23.098 --> 38:25.141
Jimmy.

38:25.183 --> 38:27.769
- Yep?
- Do you know why you're here?

38:27.811 --> 38:30.605
- Yeah. Because of Mrs Bernstein.
- Your Honour,

38:30.648 --> 38:33.483
this hearing is on the statement only.

38:33.525 --> 38:36.486
Yes. Counsellor,
please confine your questions.

38:36.528 --> 38:41.282
Jimmy... your attorney put
a lot of people on the stand today.

38:41.324 --> 38:42.827
I know.

38:42.868 --> 38:47.164
They presented... evaluations,
professional opinions

38:47.205 --> 38:50.543
and test results, all saying...

38:50.584 --> 38:53.670
that you are mentally retarded.

38:53.711 --> 38:57.841
Everyone I put on the stand...
says that you're not.

38:57.882 --> 39:00.593
But nobody asked you.

39:01.886 --> 39:05.014
Are you mentally retarded?

39:05.056 --> 39:08.351
- No.
- Your Honour, I'd like it noted

39:08.393 --> 39:11.813
that it is common for the retarded
to deny their retardation.

39:11.854 --> 39:14.774
- So noted.
- Hey! I am not retarded!

39:18.111 --> 39:20.363
Is there any way you can prove that?

39:20.405 --> 39:23.074
I can tell you what I did to Mrs Bernstein.

39:23.116 --> 39:25.868
- Objection!
- She was not dressed.

39:25.910 --> 39:30.498
- Her hands were tied up here.
- Jimmy, don't say anything else!

39:30.540 --> 39:33.376
And she was moaning. And it was...

39:33.417 --> 39:35.169
sssso...

39:35.211 --> 39:38.214
so... exciting.

39:39.966 --> 39:42.051
Your Honour...

39:42.093 --> 39:46.889
I'd like to hear what he has to say.
This will be off the record.

39:46.931 --> 39:49.016
Go ahead.

39:50.850 --> 39:53.521
I knew what she wanted.

39:53.562 --> 39:57.858
I'd seen it on the videos,
but I had never done it before.

40:00.528 --> 40:03.697
I got on top of her... and...

40:05.866 --> 40:09.328
It felt... really good!

40:10.371 --> 40:15.543
And then I tried to kiss her,
and I could see that, um... that, um,

40:15.584 --> 40:19.004
you know, something was wrong,
and I thought that...

40:19.046 --> 40:23.300
maybe I did something wrong,
so... I tried to do, er, the, um...

40:25.426 --> 40:27.845
the...

40:27.887 --> 40:31.474
the CPR that I... I seen on the TV.

40:31.517 --> 40:36.271
But, you know,
I guess I was doin' that wrong, too, and so...

40:36.313 --> 40:38.732
I got scared.

40:40.900 --> 40:42.986
And, um, I didn't...

40:43.028 --> 40:46.573
I didn't know how to explain
to anybody what happened, so...

40:46.615 --> 40:49.243
I went to the bathroom and, um...

40:50.494 --> 40:54.998
I was hiding in the bathroom
when Stan came in, and...

40:57.668 --> 41:00.503
told me that the old lady was dead.

41:16.143 --> 41:18.104
Captain. We should get together

41:18.146 --> 41:21.398
on a recommendation to the court
when you have time.

41:21.440 --> 41:26.821
Time? Write your report and put
my name on it. What's the difference?

41:26.863 --> 41:31.243
- What's eating you?
- The guy on the stand, OK?

41:31.284 --> 41:36.289
Maybe he's retarded, maybe not.
But we're talkin' about two IQ points!

41:36.331 --> 41:39.625
He was devastated by what he did.
You saw.

41:39.667 --> 41:43.754
No, I saw remorse.
He knew exactly what he was doing.

41:43.796 --> 41:47.634
When I get insomnia,
I think about the sociopathic killers

41:47.675 --> 41:50.929
I got sent to Attica. I sleep like a baby.

41:50.970 --> 41:55.391
But he's just a retarded guy
that made a bad mistake.

41:55.433 --> 41:59.895
Fine. It's the system.
Let's just put him in some quiet place

41:59.937 --> 42:02.940
where he can read Winnie The Pooh
and get hot chocolate,

42:02.981 --> 42:06.235
while Mrs Bernstein...
remember her? Gets a headstone.

42:07.362 --> 42:09.239
Whatever.

42:17.412 --> 42:20.916
OK, Jimmy, first they'll do
the paperwork, get you a room,

42:20.957 --> 42:23.585
then Dr Krasnow will see you
for the intake exam.

42:23.627 --> 42:26.464
- Dr who?
- Krasnow. He's very nice.

42:26.505 --> 42:30.967
- I've known him for years.
- Aren't you gonna stay with me?

42:31.009 --> 42:33.094
For a while, OK?

42:44.189 --> 42:46.483
No! No! Get back! Get back!
