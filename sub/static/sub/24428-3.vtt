WEBVTT

00:00.010 --> 00:01.550
So, you know how I'm running the marathon?

00:01.600 --> 00:03.190
Yeah, cos you've not shut up about it.

00:03.240 --> 00:04.430
Cos you still haven't sponsored me.

00:04.480 --> 00:06.150
I can't get me head around it.

00:06.200 --> 00:08.710
Why would anyone run if
they weren't being chased?

00:08.760 --> 00:11.390
It's for charity. I'm
running for Save The Lepers.

00:11.440 --> 00:14.190
Are they actual lepers or just
social lepers like yourself?

00:14.240 --> 00:15.470
Oh, yeah. Ha-ha-ha!

00:15.520 --> 00:17.510
Some of them are very
seriously disfigured.

00:17.560 --> 00:19.830
The money I raise will pay
for them to be quarantined.

00:19.880 --> 00:21.070
That's not saving them.

00:21.120 --> 00:22.590
That saves you from
having to look at them.

00:22.640 --> 00:23.750
It's saving everyone.

00:23.800 --> 00:25.830
Why have you put your
occupation as head barman?

00:25.880 --> 00:27.030
That's not important.

00:27.080 --> 00:29.350
It's important to the head
barman. I'll cross it out.

00:29.400 --> 00:31.070
- Don't tamper with my form.
- Woah!

00:31.120 --> 00:33.470
Your parents are giving
ten Denarii per mile?

00:33.520 --> 00:35.750
- What? That is shitloads.
- No, that's standard.

00:35.800 --> 00:38.270
Hang on. "Per mile" is
written in a different ink.

00:38.320 --> 00:40.030
- I don't think so.
- You tampered with the form.

00:40.080 --> 00:42.310
- They were being stingy.
- You sly bastard.

00:42.360 --> 00:44.070
Are you gonna put anything on my form?

00:44.120 --> 00:45.670
- Obviously not.
- I already said no.

00:45.720 --> 00:47.730
I've drawn a cock and balls.

00:48.280 --> 00:50.110
A severed cock and balls.

00:50.160 --> 00:52.230
That looks like a hate
crime against lepers.

00:52.280 --> 00:53.680
Thank you very much.

00:54.600 --> 00:56.600
♪ Yeah! When in Rome

00:57.400 --> 00:59.880
♪ Do as the Romans do

01:02.840 --> 01:04.989
♪ Far from home

01:05.040 --> 01:08.080
♪ All I got is you

01:10.720 --> 01:12.310
Grumio, the people on table three

01:12.360 --> 01:14.270
are still waiting for their apple pie.

01:14.320 --> 01:16.680
Oh, yeah. They might be waiting a while.

01:17.080 --> 01:19.990
Here, check this out. Some twat
in a pram dropped it outside.

01:21.540 --> 01:22.070
Check out what?

01:22.120 --> 01:24.790
An oaf covered in crumbs
blowing a paper toy?

01:24.840 --> 01:26.910
Yeah, but look how fast I can make it go.

01:26.960 --> 01:28.630
I'm probably setting a record.

01:28.680 --> 01:31.310
For what? Being the
world's shittest slave?

01:31.360 --> 01:33.070
Probably, yeah.

01:33.120 --> 01:35.030
For the price of just one glass of wine,

01:35.080 --> 01:37.150
we could clothe a whole family of lepers.

01:37.200 --> 01:39.350
Woah! Hey, sorry, you
can't do that in here.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.830
I'll have to ask you to leave.

01:40.880 --> 01:43.830
But I'm fundraising for the
Make A Leper Smile Foundation.

01:43.880 --> 01:46.470
Good for you. But you're
asking my customers

01:46.520 --> 01:48.870
to spend their money on
lepers rather than wine.

01:48.920 --> 01:51.150
Wow! OK, that's rather
uncharitable of you.

01:51.200 --> 01:53.470
Many of these lepers have
nothing, you realise?

01:53.520 --> 01:56.150
Mm-hm. And I've got debts.
I've got less than nothing

01:56.200 --> 01:57.910
and I do enough charity work as it is,

01:57.960 --> 01:59.990
looking after that one there, so...

02:00.040 --> 02:03.790
Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't realise.

02:03.840 --> 02:06.030
Oh, he's adorable. What's his name?

02:06.080 --> 02:09.110
His name's Grumio. He's
basically a human barnacle.

02:09.160 --> 02:11.230
Hey, Grumio. Hey, darling.

02:11.280 --> 02:13.790
Oh, bless! Oh, I bet he's a real handful.

02:13.840 --> 02:15.150
You have no idea.

02:15.200 --> 02:17.800
Well, I hope you get financial
support for all you do.

02:18.680 --> 02:19.870
No, but I really should.

02:19.920 --> 02:22.470
Oh, you certainly should.
Yes, being sole carer

02:22.520 --> 02:26.280
for someone with such obvious
disabilities can be so draining.

02:26.800 --> 02:27.990
You're not joking?

02:28.040 --> 02:30.590
Why would I joke about people
less fortunate than ourselves?

02:30.640 --> 02:32.550
Well, quite. It's no laughing matter.

02:32.600 --> 02:35.350
So... Sorry, this
financial support thingy,

02:35.400 --> 02:37.830
do you happen to know
how I might get that?

02:37.880 --> 02:40.030
Well, you have to have
a very high tolerance

02:40.080 --> 02:42.190
- for filling in boring forms.
- Ah!

02:42.240 --> 02:44.670
I actually used to work for
a major donkey charity,

02:44.720 --> 02:47.110
so I could guide you
through it if you like.

02:47.160 --> 02:48.670
That would be great.

02:49.720 --> 02:51.750
On second thoughts,
you're welcome to stay.

02:51.800 --> 02:53.190
Oh!

02:55.440 --> 02:57.740
I'd be pleased with
anything under four hours.

02:57.800 --> 02:58.470
Four hours?

02:58.520 --> 03:00.510
You gonna be doing it
on your hands and knees?

03:00.560 --> 03:01.950
That's a solid marathon time.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.110
Mate, I've had relationships
shorter than that.

03:04.160 --> 03:05.910
Well, clearly you know nothing about

03:05.960 --> 03:07.310
running or relationships.

03:07.360 --> 03:09.350
Oh, yeah? So how come I won medals, then,

03:09.400 --> 03:10.870
in running, not relationships.

03:10.920 --> 03:12.830
When was this? Under sevens, under eights?

03:12.880 --> 03:14.430
- Under 11s, actually.
- Ha!

03:14.480 --> 03:17.670
So what? They used to
call me Jase the Pace.

03:17.720 --> 03:19.470
So, you were a child. It doesn't count.

03:19.520 --> 03:20.630
Of course it counts.

03:20.680 --> 03:23.190
God-given talent like
mine never goes away.

03:23.240 --> 03:24.790
Well, enter the marathon, then.

03:24.840 --> 03:26.990
I would love to see
Jase the Pace in action.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.630
You'd have to make do with seeing him

03:28.680 --> 03:30.870
- as a speck in the distance.
- Oh, big chat.

03:30.920 --> 03:33.870
How about, whoever comes
first gets to be head barman?

03:33.920 --> 03:37.270
- I'm already head barman.
- And wear a massive crown.

03:37.320 --> 03:38.550
OK, bring it!

03:38.600 --> 03:41.000
Oh, I've brought it. Consider it brought.

03:43.040 --> 03:45.470
So, as soon as we've got that
all-important certificate

03:45.520 --> 03:47.910
from the Marathon Board,
you can start fundraising.

03:47.960 --> 03:49.990
I really do appreciate this, Diana.

03:50.040 --> 03:51.990
As does Grumio, in his own way.

03:52.040 --> 03:53.950
Oh, stop it! As soon as I stared into

03:54.000 --> 03:57.110
his vacant yet wise eyes,
I knew I had to help.

03:57.160 --> 03:58.830
Now, name of charity?

03:58.880 --> 04:00.590
I've gone with The Grumio Foundation.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.230
Oh, nice. Catchy!

04:02.280 --> 04:04.710
Purpose of charity?
Caring for those suffering

04:04.760 --> 04:07.190
from the affliction
known as Grumio Syndrome.

04:07.240 --> 04:09.710
Right. That is just
Grumio though, isn't it?

04:09.760 --> 04:11.550
Currently, yes. Now, what would you say

04:11.600 --> 04:13.670
were the symptoms of Grumio Syndrome?

04:13.720 --> 04:17.390
Erm... OK. He gets very hungry.

04:17.440 --> 04:19.510
Oh, bless! So, acute hunger.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.950
- And he's always tired.
- Chronic fatigue.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.990
I'd also add grumpiness,
and... is ingratitude a symptom?

04:26.040 --> 04:28.790
I don't think so, no. But
we've got plenty to go on,

04:28.840 --> 04:30.950
and the panel will get
a much better picture

04:31.000 --> 04:32.470
once they meet him in person.

04:32.520 --> 04:34.670
Hm... So they actually
have to meet him, do they?

04:34.720 --> 04:35.830
Yes, of course.

04:35.880 --> 04:37.830
They can hardly endorse
the Grumio Foundation

04:37.880 --> 04:39.270
without meeting Grumio.

04:39.320 --> 04:41.390
Yeah. It's just... I should have said:

04:41.440 --> 04:43.670
another symptom of his
syndrome is shyness.

04:43.720 --> 04:45.430
- Oh!
- Both acute and chronic,

04:45.480 --> 04:47.630
so panels are a bit of a no-no.

04:47.680 --> 04:49.870
Well, we'll just have
to make them a yes-yes.

04:49.920 --> 04:51.390
I find, if it helps, the best way

04:51.440 --> 04:52.870
to win over the mentally afflicted

04:52.920 --> 04:55.000
is to turn everything into a game.

05:02.920 --> 05:05.830
Wow! Grumio, you've got
that thing really spinning.

05:05.880 --> 05:08.470
Tell me about it. I've been
doing some training of me own.

05:08.520 --> 05:10.070
I can see.

05:10.120 --> 05:13.070
In fact, there was a girl in
the bar last night, Diana,

05:13.120 --> 05:15.510
who saw you in action
and was just blown away.

05:15.560 --> 05:17.390
She'd love to introduce
you to some people.

05:17.440 --> 05:19.510
People? What people?

05:19.560 --> 05:21.510
They're like a panel of judges,

05:21.560 --> 05:24.070
who will see if you can break a
record for blowing a windmill.

05:24.120 --> 05:25.950
You mean, they're a windmill-blowing,

05:26.000 --> 05:27.390
record-judging panel?

05:27.440 --> 05:31.110
Exactly. And, if you won,
you'd get a certificate.

05:31.160 --> 05:33.590
Obviously I told her you
wouldn't be interested.

05:33.640 --> 05:35.750
You know, you don't do it
for the awards or anything.

05:35.800 --> 05:38.110
- I do it for the love.
- Well, this is what I thought.

05:38.160 --> 05:39.390
But, that being said,

05:39.440 --> 05:41.470
when you achieve something extraordinary,

05:41.520 --> 05:43.230
it's nice to have it recognised.

05:43.280 --> 05:44.950
So, shall I tell her we're on, then?

05:45.000 --> 05:47.110
Fine. Now give me some space.

05:47.160 --> 05:49.550
I need to get back to me training.

05:51.000 --> 05:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:02.600 --> 06:04.430
Why-aye, stop that! What you trying to do?

06:04.480 --> 06:06.270
Push the place over or something?

06:06.320 --> 06:08.470
No, no, no. Stretching the old calves out.

06:08.520 --> 06:12.150
- Part of my training regime.
- Oh, regime? Regime? Very posh!

06:12.200 --> 06:13.430
So what are we talking then?

06:13.480 --> 06:16.110
Well, what I was thinking:
run to the sandwich shop,

06:16.160 --> 06:18.030
get a bacon roll, then run back.

06:18.080 --> 06:20.390
See, I wouldn't run just
after eating, you lunatic.

06:20.440 --> 06:23.230
- You'll give yourself a stitch.
- Mm, yeah. Good point!

06:23.280 --> 06:24.670
What about, run there,

06:24.720 --> 06:26.950
eat my lunch and then just walk back?

06:27.000 --> 06:29.190
See, I wouldn't run on
an empty stomach either.

06:29.240 --> 06:31.830
Yes. Well, maybe I'll
just walk there as well.

06:31.880 --> 06:34.470
Yeah, cheers, Landlord,
that's a much better regime.

06:34.520 --> 06:35.670
Any time, any time.

06:35.720 --> 06:38.430
Consider me your personal trainer.

06:38.480 --> 06:40.280
Cheers, boy!

06:51.640 --> 06:53.190
Step it up, mate, you're losing.

06:53.240 --> 06:54.990
I'm not losing. This isn't a race.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.790
- You're at the back.
- We're just training.

06:56.840 --> 06:57.950
It's non-competitive.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.590
Maybe I'll get my crown fitted now.

06:59.640 --> 07:00.830
Excuse me, coming through.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.780
Sorry, Phyllis. Excuse me. Thank you.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.080
Sorry.

07:09.680 --> 07:14.470
Everyone, this is Marcus and,
of course, Grumio himself.

07:14.520 --> 07:16.470
It's a pleasure to meet you, Grumio.

07:16.520 --> 07:17.990
How are you feeling today?

07:18.040 --> 07:20.430
Nervous, but also pretty psyched.

07:20.480 --> 07:24.230
Huh! Good for you. We're
all pretty psyched too.

07:24.280 --> 07:27.830
Maybe you'd like to start by
telling us a bit about yourself?

07:27.880 --> 07:29.030
OK. Erm...

07:29.080 --> 07:30.870
Grumio prefers to express himself

07:30.920 --> 07:32.750
with actions rather than words.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.070
He's brought something
in he'd like to show you.

07:35.120 --> 07:38.710
Oh, now that is splendid.
Look at those colours.

07:38.760 --> 07:40.950
Colours don't matter.
They're just decoration.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.390
Oh, right you are, champ. Silly me!

07:43.440 --> 07:46.280
Why don't you just go for it?
So the panel can check you out.

07:47.080 --> 07:49.430
OK. Here we go.

07:49.480 --> 07:51.350
Can I get a countdown, please?

07:51.400 --> 07:52.710
Of course.

07:52.760 --> 07:55.390
Three, two, one, go.

08:11.800 --> 08:14.470
And... stop.

08:18.320 --> 08:20.880
Did I win? Have I done it?

08:25.460 --> 08:26.470
Where are the sleeves?

08:26.520 --> 08:29.110
It's not supposed to
have sleeves, you fool.

08:29.160 --> 08:31.350
It's a state-of-the-art sports tunic.

08:31.400 --> 08:34.590
I also bought these cushion
soled running sandals. Uh-oh!

08:34.640 --> 08:36.830
You can't intimidate me, boy.

08:36.880 --> 08:39.870
You might have all the kit,
but I've got the fit-ness.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.909
You don't have any of the fit-ness.

08:41.960 --> 08:44.710
Your regime seems to consist
of eating bacon rolls.

08:44.760 --> 08:46.470
Bacon and lettuce actually.

08:46.520 --> 08:48.350
Sometimes with a slice of tomato.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.710
The only thing that's fast
about you is your mouth,

08:50.760 --> 08:52.790
which come race day
will be eating my dust.

08:52.840 --> 08:54.510
If I was beaten by you, Aurelius,

08:54.560 --> 08:56.710
- I'd eat me own shit.
- OK, fine. You're on!

08:56.760 --> 08:58.550
Fine! What? On for what?

08:58.600 --> 09:00.270
Whoever wins gets to be head barman.

09:00.320 --> 09:02.310
Whoever loses eats their own shit.

09:02.360 --> 09:04.150
Well, I wasn't actually suggesting that.

09:04.200 --> 09:05.990
Then don't casually use expressions like

09:06.040 --> 09:08.150
"I'd eat my own shit," Jase the Pace.

09:08.200 --> 09:10.870
- Are we on or not?
- Oh, we're on.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.670
We're on for the crapathon.

09:12.720 --> 09:15.430
- Crapathon, eatathon.
- Oh, yum, yum, yummy.

09:15.480 --> 09:16.790
You're eating from your bummy.

09:16.840 --> 09:18.550
- Excuse me, is anyone serving?
- Yes.

09:18.600 --> 09:21.390
- Sorry, what can I get you?
- A glass of wine, please?

09:21.440 --> 09:23.950
Er... Excuse me, you haven't paid.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.030
Hey! No, where you going?

09:26.580 --> 09:28.740
Oi! Come back!

09:32.200 --> 09:34.800
Oi! Get back here.

09:45.440 --> 09:46.950
I could have done better.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.950
The air in that room were too stodgy.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.670
It slowed me blades right down.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.910
Let's just wait and see, shall we?

09:52.960 --> 09:54.590
Look, here comes Diana now.

09:54.640 --> 09:57.310
Oh, blimey, she's holding summat.

09:57.360 --> 09:58.360
Do you think it's...

09:58.880 --> 10:00.710
I did it. I won the certificate.

10:00.760 --> 10:01.990
You did, you little legend.

10:02.040 --> 10:04.430
You were magnificent in there, Grumio.

10:04.480 --> 10:05.670
You showed such character.

10:05.720 --> 10:08.070
- Well, I had to dig deep.
- Here, I'll take that.

10:08.120 --> 10:09.430
What does it say then?

10:09.480 --> 10:11.110
It just confirms your achievement.

10:11.160 --> 10:12.550
I should probably take him home.

10:12.600 --> 10:13.870
He's had a tiring day.

10:13.920 --> 10:15.590
Thank you so much for all your help.

10:15.640 --> 10:17.150
Well, we've only just begun.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.790
Now we have to spread the word

10:18.840 --> 10:20.870
and convince people to run for Grumio.

10:20.920 --> 10:22.190
- Run? You what?
- OK, great.

10:22.240 --> 10:23.990
- We'll see you around.
- OK.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.750
What were all that about running for me?

10:25.800 --> 10:27.430
I don't know. She can be a bit weird.

10:27.480 --> 10:29.390
- Grumio.
- Oh, hello again.

10:29.440 --> 10:30.950
- We're heading home.
- Of course.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.470
I just wanted to thank you
for showing such courage...

10:33.520 --> 10:35.070
- No probs.
- We really do have to go.

10:35.120 --> 10:37.110
.. in the face of your
profound disability.

10:37.160 --> 10:39.070
And we all hope that with this certificate

10:39.120 --> 10:42.310
your devoted carer can raise
lots of sponsorship money

10:42.360 --> 10:44.460
to better tend to your very special needs.

10:45.780 --> 10:46.960
Best of luck, champ!

10:50.740 --> 10:52.960
You dirty, dirty bastard.

10:55.640 --> 10:57.470
"The Rome Marathon Committee

10:57.520 --> 11:01.590
hereby certify that the Grumio Foundation

11:01.640 --> 11:03.870
is an officially recognised charity."

11:04.920 --> 11:06.390
I'm gonna get this framed.

11:06.440 --> 11:08.070
He's made me look a right numpty.

11:08.120 --> 11:10.550
Er... To be fair, you did
most of the hard yard yourself.

11:10.600 --> 11:13.350
Hang on. Does this mean I'm not
the windmill-blowing champ?

11:13.400 --> 11:15.590
- Of course you're not.
- Well, who is then?

11:15.640 --> 11:18.030
Nobody, because it's not a real sport.

11:18.080 --> 11:20.470
Oh, my jove, you're killing me here.

11:20.520 --> 11:22.470
Look, Grumio, I am sorry I lied to you,

11:22.520 --> 11:25.030
but, please, all I'm asking,
is you go along with it

11:25.080 --> 11:26.590
so we can do a bit of fund raising.

11:26.640 --> 11:29.430
I'm impressed. That is dark, even for you.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.270
Scamming nice people out of their cash.

11:31.320 --> 11:32.670
They're not nice people.

11:32.720 --> 11:34.990
They're bleeding heart,
woolly-headed snowflakes

11:35.040 --> 11:36.150
who get a smug boner

11:36.200 --> 11:38.310
from giving their small change to charity.

11:38.360 --> 11:40.510
They don't care whether
that's the lepers or us.

11:40.560 --> 11:43.150
The lepers or you, you
mean. What's in it for me?

11:43.200 --> 11:45.070
Well, here at the Grumio Foundation

11:45.120 --> 11:47.430
we'll give you a life
as rich and rewarding

11:47.480 --> 11:48.910
as any other boy or girl.

11:49.560 --> 11:51.990
Maybe a pony ride!

11:52.040 --> 11:55.590
Come on, Grumio, it's not
long until the marathon.

11:55.640 --> 11:57.230
All you've got to do is sit back,

11:57.280 --> 11:58.790
let me take care of you until then.

11:58.840 --> 12:01.630
- I'm sure you can handle that.
- Fine!

12:01.680 --> 12:04.110
- I can if you can.
- Thanks, champ.

12:04.160 --> 12:06.190
Oi, Jase, how do you fancy running

12:06.240 --> 12:07.430
for the Grumio Foundation?

12:07.480 --> 12:09.230
I'm not sure I can run
at all, to be honest.

12:09.280 --> 12:11.230
Let alone beat that bearded bastard.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.750
Come on, are you Jase the Pace or not?

12:13.800 --> 12:16.500
You've got to knuckle down
and do some actual training.

12:18.360 --> 12:20.070
I need to nobble another runner.

12:20.120 --> 12:23.230
Oh! The bacon roll regime
not cutting it, then?

12:23.280 --> 12:24.910
No, not so much. Can you help me out?

12:24.960 --> 12:26.750
Well, I might know someone

12:26.800 --> 12:28.630
with a stash of super-strength laxatives

12:28.680 --> 12:30.910
made from the Egyptian colocynth plant.

12:30.960 --> 12:33.230
- What, like a drug dealer?
- No. Me mother.

12:33.280 --> 12:35.750
Yeah, she was horribly
bunged up last month.

12:35.800 --> 12:38.030
Then she took that stuff
and then she wasn't.

12:38.080 --> 12:39.390
Oh, cool.

12:39.440 --> 12:41.230
As long as it means Aurelius can't run.

12:41.280 --> 12:43.080
It will certainly give him the runs.

12:43.640 --> 12:44.590
Slip that in his drink,

12:44.640 --> 12:47.470
wait 24 hours and he'll
paint the town brown.

12:47.520 --> 12:49.070
Amazing! Thank you.

12:49.120 --> 12:50.510
And any other ideas are welcome,

12:50.560 --> 12:51.910
no matter how drastic.

12:51.960 --> 12:54.550
You could creep up on him and
slice open his hamstrings.

12:54.600 --> 12:57.710
Er... Nah! That's a bit too drastic.

12:57.760 --> 12:59.320
OK.

13:02.300 --> 13:03.990
- Give for Grumio.
- Give for Grumio.

13:04.040 --> 13:05.830
Give for me.

13:05.880 --> 13:09.070
Grumio's plight seems to have
caught the popular imagination.

13:09.120 --> 13:10.750
I've already persuaded 22 runners

13:10.800 --> 13:12.430
to switch from the lepers to us.

13:12.480 --> 13:15.230
Oh, that's incredible. I mean,
will the lepers not mind?

13:15.280 --> 13:17.110
No, the lepers have got plenty of funding,

13:17.160 --> 13:18.670
so it's no skin off their nose.

13:18.720 --> 13:20.070
Oh, poor choice of phrase!

13:20.920 --> 13:22.630
I'm hungry. I want a snacky.

13:22.680 --> 13:25.230
OK. Well, we can get you
a snack when we get home.

13:25.280 --> 13:26.990
Get me a snacky now, carer.

13:27.040 --> 13:30.550
Well, Diana, you don't have
a snacky on you, do you?

13:30.600 --> 13:32.230
Sadly not. No snackies here.

13:32.280 --> 13:34.990
- Come on, champ. Not far to go.
- I'm too tired to walk,

13:35.040 --> 13:36.310
on account of me syndrome.

13:36.360 --> 13:38.110
Oh, that will be the chronic fatigue.

13:38.160 --> 13:39.270
Of course it is.

13:39.320 --> 13:41.830
You'll have to carry me.
Like what you normally do.

13:41.880 --> 13:43.630
Oh!

13:43.680 --> 13:45.760
Right, yeah. On you get, then.

13:48.120 --> 13:48.950
Ha-ha!

13:49.000 --> 13:52.100
It looks like you've been eating
a few too many snackies, Grumio.

13:52.960 --> 13:54.150
Hang on, I've changed my mind.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.910
I want you to push me round
in one of them wheelie things.

13:56.960 --> 13:58.960
Just one sec, Diana.

14:00.640 --> 14:01.750
What are you doing?

14:01.800 --> 14:04.150
You wanted to care for me. I
thought you could handle it.

14:04.200 --> 14:06.030
I didn't expect you to
pull a stunt like this.

14:06.080 --> 14:08.310
- Stop over-egging the pudding.
- The pudding can get

14:08.360 --> 14:10.110
a lot eggier than this. Don't tempt me.

14:10.160 --> 14:12.590
- What does that mean?
- Carer, I need toilet.

14:12.640 --> 14:13.830
- Really?
- Oh!

14:13.880 --> 14:15.990
- Right now?
- I'm gonna wet me knick-knocks.

14:16.040 --> 14:18.670
OK. I'll get you the wheelie thing.

14:18.720 --> 14:20.190
Thanks, Marcus. Love you.

14:21.240 --> 14:22.000
Hi.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.870
He really does care, doesn't he?

14:23.920 --> 14:27.150
Oh, he's the caring-est
carer in the whole world.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.750
I'm ever so lucky.

14:37.600 --> 14:38.890
Good run. Whoo!

14:39.240 --> 14:41.430
Hey, marathon man, how was training?

14:41.480 --> 14:43.710
Great. You should try it sometime.

14:43.760 --> 14:45.750
I'm hitting peak form
in time for tomorrow.

14:45.800 --> 14:48.070
Shame you hit yours when you were ten.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.910
I'm just trying to conserve my energy.

14:49.960 --> 14:51.150
Sure. Well, you'll need it

14:51.200 --> 14:53.150
when you're chowing down on your own chod.

14:53.200 --> 14:54.750
No condiments, by the way.

14:54.800 --> 14:56.310
I don't want you masking the taste.

14:56.360 --> 14:58.350
Fine! No condiments, I promise.

14:58.400 --> 14:59.450
Runner's honour!

15:00.200 --> 15:03.000
Here, have some water. You
must be parched after your run.

15:03.720 --> 15:05.320
I am, yes. Thank you.

15:11.480 --> 15:13.670
Another pie? Are you serious?

15:13.720 --> 15:15.510
I'm gonna need all the energy I can get

15:15.560 --> 15:17.590
when I'm running this marathon, aren't I?

15:17.640 --> 15:20.710
Sweetheart. But you know you
can't run the marathon yourself?

15:20.760 --> 15:23.750
I can. Me and Marcus have
figured out a way of doing it.

15:23.800 --> 15:26.310
Have we? I don't remember
us discussing it.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.550
Everybody, my name is Grumio,

15:28.600 --> 15:30.790
off of the Grumio Foundation.

15:31.340 --> 15:32.960
Ahhh.

15:34.640 --> 15:36.550
Ta for all your support so far.

15:36.600 --> 15:38.910
So, I had wanted to run this marathon,

15:38.960 --> 15:42.230
but what with the old syndrome,
that sadly will not be possible.

15:42.280 --> 15:45.470
So, instead, I'm gonna get
pushed round the course

15:45.520 --> 15:48.870
in me wheelie thing by
my lovely carer... Marcus.

15:48.920 --> 15:52.470
- Ahhh!
- Ha! Wow, Marcus!

15:53.020 --> 15:54.390
You piece of shit, Grumio.

15:54.440 --> 15:57.310
Who will also be wearing
a flowerpot on his head.

15:57.360 --> 16:02.310
So, let's have a toast to my hero Marcus.

16:02.360 --> 16:05.270
- To Marcus.
- To Marcus.

16:05.320 --> 16:07.560
- Bottoms up!
- Oh, yeah.

16:21.200 --> 16:23.150
I just adore the flowerpot.

16:23.200 --> 16:25.950
Yeah, I might actually take
it off once we get going.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.270
It is quite awkward.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.670
No, you wont. You'll leave
it on until the end.

16:29.720 --> 16:31.830
I wish I could just take off my syndrome,

16:31.880 --> 16:34.350
but, alas, I cannot. It is for life.

16:34.400 --> 16:37.670
Oh, you are just bloody
heroes, both of you.

16:37.720 --> 16:39.070
Huh! Thank you.

16:39.120 --> 16:42.110
'Runners, stand by, please,
for the race to commence.

16:43.800 --> 16:45.110
It's probably just nerves.

16:45.160 --> 16:46.910
I remember the under
11s cross country final,

16:46.960 --> 16:48.270
I was all over the place.

16:48.320 --> 16:49.870
I've got nothing to be nervous about.

16:49.920 --> 16:52.510
- I'm a finely-tuned machine.
- You'll be fine.

16:52.560 --> 16:53.790
Good luck, pal.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.550
May the best man win.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.090
Oh! Aaargh.

16:57.640 --> 16:59.070
OK, that didn't feel amazing.

16:59.120 --> 17:02.430
Will the runners take
their positions, please.

17:02.980 --> 17:03.870
Go on, Grumio.

17:03.920 --> 17:06.790
- Keep going, Grumio.
- Nice and smoothly now, carer.

17:06.839 --> 17:09.270
We can't have me jiggling
about in my condition.

17:09.319 --> 17:11.750
Mm-hm. As soon as I get
that charity money,

17:11.800 --> 17:13.990
your condition is finding a miracle cure.

17:14.040 --> 17:17.230
'Three, two, one.

17:43.960 --> 17:46.470
- Thank you.
- Go on, Grumio.

17:46.520 --> 17:48.150
You're kidding me!

17:52.520 --> 17:54.060
Ooh!

17:58.520 --> 18:00.510
Oh, look at them fruit up there.

18:00.560 --> 18:02.430
No, Grumio, I can't take any more weight.

18:02.480 --> 18:03.990
Don't be a baby. It's only fruit.

18:04.040 --> 18:05.670
Yes, please.

18:05.720 --> 18:08.030
- Argh!
- Anyone need a lift?

18:09.960 --> 18:11.760
Bleurgh!

18:15.460 --> 18:16.630
'Congratulations!

18:17.180 --> 18:18.130
'Keep going.

18:21.120 --> 18:23.350
Nearly there!

18:30.840 --> 18:32.750
- Jase the Pace?
- Yeah, what?

18:32.800 --> 18:34.750
Were you the one who
unpicked my running sandals?

18:34.800 --> 18:36.590
- Yes.
- And fed me laxatives?

18:36.640 --> 18:38.190
Yeah. And I put honey in your hair.

18:38.240 --> 18:40.790
- I didn't know about that one.
- I wanted the bees to eat you.

18:40.840 --> 18:43.630
Bees don't eat honey, they
make it. Bees eat pollen.

18:43.680 --> 18:45.190
It doesn't matter now, does it?

18:45.240 --> 18:47.880
I'm broken. It's all over.

18:51.360 --> 18:52.110
Come on.

18:53.160 --> 18:55.060
- What are you doing?
- You've come too far.

18:56.200 --> 18:58.630
I won't leave a man
behind. Runner's honour!

19:01.240 --> 19:03.150
Thanks, Aurelius.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.750
We can both be head barman.

19:05.800 --> 19:07.120
Ha-ha-ha!

19:11.040 --> 19:12.710
- Yes!
- Booooo!

19:12.760 --> 19:15.990
I've beaten you. Eat shit.

19:16.040 --> 19:17.950
Head barman, baby.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Whoo!

19:21.440 --> 19:23.040
- Grumio.
- Well done, Grumio.

19:23.090 --> 19:24.110
Cheers.

19:25.260 --> 19:26.430
You did it, Grumio.

19:31.600 --> 19:32.380
Easy-peasy.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.750
So, how did we do?

19:36.800 --> 19:37.500
You tell them.

19:38.480 --> 19:41.190
We raised a total of --
you won't believe it --

19:41.240 --> 19:44.230
36,435 Denarii

19:44.280 --> 19:46.430
and 82 Sesterces.

19:46.480 --> 19:48.430
Oh, my jove, that is incredible.

19:48.480 --> 19:51.230
Which puts you in sixth place
between Lepers International

19:51.280 --> 19:53.110
and Action For Lonely Lepers.

19:53.160 --> 19:54.630
We're in a leper sandwich.

19:54.680 --> 19:57.030
Not a sandwich I'd care
to eat, but well done.

19:57.080 --> 19:59.390
I guess I'm gonna need a bigger bag then?

19:59.440 --> 20:01.910
Oh, no. You won't be
taking that home with you.

20:01.960 --> 20:03.670
Ah! Sorry, why's that?

20:03.720 --> 20:05.390
Well, the charity's made so much

20:05.440 --> 20:07.590
the earnings have to be
officially administered

20:07.640 --> 20:09.870
by a full-time chief executive.

20:09.920 --> 20:11.910
Right, which is me, presumably?

20:11.960 --> 20:15.910
Er... No. You're a carer with
no experience in the sector.

20:15.960 --> 20:19.110
Luckily for you, Diana has plenty.

20:19.160 --> 20:20.870
So I've sanctioned her appointment.

20:20.920 --> 20:21.990
Oh, phew!

20:22.040 --> 20:23.830
I thought I was getting cut out there.

20:23.880 --> 20:25.670
Well, hm, the thing is, Marcus,

20:25.720 --> 20:28.150
as the CEO of a growing charity,

20:28.200 --> 20:30.750
I'd be a fool not to pump
money into marketing and PR.

20:30.800 --> 20:32.870
And once you've taken
into account office rental

20:32.920 --> 20:34.350
and, of course, my salary,

20:34.400 --> 20:36.550
there's very little left
for frontline services.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.950
OK. How little exactly?

20:39.000 --> 20:40.630
Yeah... no, nothing.

20:40.680 --> 20:42.550
What? I'm getting no money?

20:42.600 --> 20:45.830
What about Grumio with his
acute and chronic symptoms?

20:45.880 --> 20:46.950
How will I care for him?

20:47.000 --> 20:48.710
You've managed heroically so far.

20:48.760 --> 20:52.190
Just keep doing that. Anyway,
the foundation did invest

20:52.240 --> 20:55.110
in a brand-new windmill for him.

20:55.160 --> 20:58.110
- How's that, champ?
- I prefer me old one.

20:58.160 --> 21:01.590
- Oh, bless!
- This is a stitch-up, isn't it?

21:01.640 --> 21:03.150
That's why you've been so helpful,

21:03.200 --> 21:04.630
to siphon off all of our money.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.070
- Excuse me?
- You've known

21:06.120 --> 21:08.390
there's nothing wrong with
Grumio, from the start.

21:08.440 --> 21:10.870
Well, of course there's
nothing wrong with him.

21:10.920 --> 21:12.670
Just because someone has Grumio Syndrome,

21:12.720 --> 21:15.420
it doesn't mean they can't
lead a perfectly normal life.

21:19.720 --> 21:21.640
Come on, then, champ. Let's go home.

21:22.280 --> 21:24.350
Are you gonna push me?

21:24.400 --> 21:26.360
All right, get in.

21:30.120 --> 21:33.030
Nice and smooth, please.

21:33.080 --> 21:35.470
Whee! Hoo-hoo! Ha-ha!

21:47.560 --> 21:48.790
Urgh, urgh, urgh.
