00:23.713 --> 00:26.432
- It's me.
- You're there. Come over.

00:26.513 --> 00:28.629
Later. I'm taking stuff to Joshua's.

00:30.193 --> 00:32.991
- I got a situation.
- What kind of situation?

00:33.073 --> 00:35.303
It's an emergency.

00:36.873 --> 00:39.865
- Oh, God. No!
- Logan! Logan!

00:54.513 --> 00:56.231
Logan!

00:57.393 --> 00:59.349
Oh, Max. Thank God.

00:59.433 --> 01:03.142
- Are you OK? What happened?
- Eyes Only met his match.

01:03.233 --> 01:05.462
Uncle Logan!

01:07.113 --> 01:09.388
- Hi. What's your name?
- Go away.

01:09.473 --> 01:11.191
Nice name. I'm Max.

01:11.273 --> 01:13.309
- Brittany, say hi.
- No.

01:14.193 --> 01:17.344
- Max is here to help me take care of you.
- No.

01:17.713 --> 01:20.944
- Took the word right out of my mouth.
- Wait, Max, no.

01:21.033 --> 01:24.469
Wait. You gotta help me out here.

01:25.113 --> 01:30.346
My cousin Bitsy called. Some rigamarole.
She needs to drop her off for the day.

01:30.433 --> 01:33.743
Bitsy? Where's husband Biff?
Where's the nanny?

01:33.833 --> 01:37.508
I don't know. Maybe Biff ran off
with the nanny. Who cares?

01:37.593 --> 01:41.268
I'm exhausted. She won't take a nap
or eat anything I give her.

01:41.353 --> 01:44.390
She doesn't like bruschetta
with a crisp Sauternes?

01:44.473 --> 01:48.989
- I'm begging you.
- Look, I'd love to, but she doesn't like me.

01:49.073 --> 01:53.191
Oh, no, she's just saying that.
She does like you. I can tell.

01:53.273 --> 01:55.423
Please help me.

02:13.993 --> 02:16.461
Can I have one?

02:16.553 --> 02:18.748
- Depends.
- On what?

02:19.113 --> 02:22.230
- On whether you read a story with me.
- OK.

02:28.953 --> 02:31.308
Logan, you got any kids' stories?

02:33.433 --> 02:35.663
As a matter of fact...

02:36.513 --> 02:39.152
I think I do.

02:40.273 --> 02:43.743
This oughta do it.
Hans Christian Andersen.

02:44.993 --> 02:47.507
I've been looking for this stuff.

02:52.113 --> 02:54.104
Oh, look, a mermaid.

02:54.193 --> 02:57.708
- There's no such thing.
- How do you know?

02:57.793 --> 02:59.670
They're just stories.

02:59.753 --> 03:02.108
- You want me to read this or not?
- OK.

03:03.753 --> 03:08.031
"Once upon a time, in a splendid palace
on the bed of the bluest ocean,

03:08.113 --> 03:11.788
lived the Sea King with his five daughters,
beautiful mermaids,

03:11.873 --> 03:14.262
"Sirenetta, the youngest of them all."

03:14.353 --> 03:17.948
- She's pretty.
- She had a beautiful voice too.

03:18.033 --> 03:21.070
"When she sang,
the fishes flocked to listen."

03:21.153 --> 03:23.951
"She'd sing and gaze up,
seeking the sunlight

03:24.033 --> 03:27.150
that barely managed
to filter down into the depths."

03:27.233 --> 03:31.749
"Nothing pleased the mermaid more
than to hear about the world above the sea."

03:31.833 --> 03:37.624
"She made her grandmother tell her
everything she knew about ships, towns..."

03:37.713 --> 03:40.511
"'Oh, how I'd love to go up there
and see the sky,

03:40.593 --> 03:42.868
which everyone says is so pretty,

03:42.953 --> 03:44.953
and smell the scent of the flowers
and hear the voices of the humans."'

03:44.953 --> 03:48.309
And smell the scent of the flowers
and hear the voices of the humans."'

03:55.433 --> 03:58.186
Which one of you idiots left the rig out?

03:59.273 --> 04:02.663
- We've been dragging the net all this time.
- Sorry, Jack.

04:02.753 --> 04:05.551
I could've sworn I pulled this thing up.

04:17.512 --> 04:20.266
Just a bunch of crap. Let's get it off.

04:31.313 --> 04:33.508
Oh, my God.

04:35.833 --> 04:38.267
We snagged a floater.

04:38.873 --> 04:42.548
- Oh, crap.
- Great, all we need.

04:45.713 --> 04:48.068
Whoa! She's alive.

04:55.273 --> 04:57.264
What the...?

04:59.113 --> 05:02.549
Looks like some kinda gills.

05:02.633 --> 05:04.908
Gills? What the hell is she?

05:07.673 --> 05:09.948
A mermaid.

05:15.033 --> 05:19.868
They designed her to be
the perfect soldier. A human weapon.

05:19.953 --> 05:21.830
Then she escaped.

05:21.913 --> 05:26.270
In a future not far from now,
in a broken world,

05:26.353 --> 05:28.708
she is haunted by her past.

05:28.793 --> 05:34.231
She cannot run.
She must fight to discover her destiny.

06:09.793 --> 06:12.705
Thanks so much. Do I owe you anything?

06:12.793 --> 06:15.910
- Me? No, it was fun.
- She's a friend, Bits.

06:16.993 --> 06:18.984
- There you go.
- Thank you.

06:19.073 --> 06:21.223
- See ya, sweetie.
- Kiss, Max?

06:22.393 --> 06:25.112
How about a kiss for Uncle Logan?

06:25.713 --> 06:27.863
We never got to finish the story.

06:27.953 --> 06:31.070
Because you got sleepyheaded.
We'll finish it next time.

06:31.153 --> 06:34.463
Did the mermaid
ever get to see her family again?

06:34.553 --> 06:37.625
Yeah, and they all lived happily ever after.

06:38.593 --> 06:41.027
- Thanks again, you guys.
- No problem.

06:42.353 --> 06:45.789
- Oh, and Max, it was nice meeting you.
- You too.

06:53.393 --> 06:55.907
I don't think that's how it ends, actually.

06:55.993 --> 06:57.790
- What?
- The Little Mermaid.

06:57.873 --> 07:03.425
I think she falls for a prince,
but then he blows her off for a real girl.

07:03.513 --> 07:09.588
"Real"? Just because someone happens
to have a tail doesn't mean they're not real.

07:09.673 --> 07:13.666
You know what I mean. God,
it's like this exoskeleton weighs a ton.

07:13.753 --> 07:16.347
Why do writers always
go for the tragic endings?

07:16.433 --> 07:19.345
What's wrong with a happy ending
once in a while?

07:19.793 --> 07:22.387
I prefer the Disney version myself.

07:22.473 --> 07:24.543
- Is it hot in here?
- Are you OK?

07:24.633 --> 07:28.421
I think I might be getting a cold.
It feels like I have a fever.

07:28.513 --> 07:30.026
- Oh, my God.
- What?

07:30.113 --> 07:32.104
Your wrist.

07:33.793 --> 07:36.591
Oh, God, it can't be.
I mean, we didn't touch.

07:36.673 --> 07:39.949
- No, we didn't. Did we?
- No.

07:40.033 --> 07:42.228
- Take it easy.
- We both touched Brittany.

07:42.313 --> 07:44.463
- That's not how it works.
- We don't know.

07:44.553 --> 07:48.182
It's one thing for Manticore
to give you a retrovirus to kill me,

07:48.273 --> 07:51.948
but I doubt they factored
a six-year-old into their evil plan.

07:53.033 --> 07:56.343
She kissed both of us. Me first.

07:57.473 --> 08:01.261
- Logan, your face.
- It's nothing.

08:01.353 --> 08:04.151
- We gotta get you to a hospital.
- I just need a nap.

08:04.233 --> 08:06.144
- Can you get into your chair?
- No.

08:06.233 --> 08:09.384
I can't touch you!
You have to do it yourself!

08:09.473 --> 08:12.465
We need someone to help. Who do I call?

08:12.553 --> 08:15.750
- Speed-dial six.
- Speed-dial six.

08:21.913 --> 08:25.303
Who's this? Asha, we need you
to get over here right away.

08:26.553 --> 08:28.908
- What do we got?
- BP 60/40 and falling.

08:28.993 --> 08:31.029
- What's his temp?
- Came in at 105.

08:31.113 --> 08:34.991
OK, start IV Naprosyn.
100cc's of methicillin.

08:35.073 --> 08:36.631
Logan?

08:36.712 --> 08:39.022
Get me a chem-7, stat. What's his temp?

08:39.113 --> 08:41.991
- 105.5 and rising.
- OK, get him on ice.

08:42.073 --> 08:44.029
Logan, buddy, can you hear me?

08:46.513 --> 08:48.708
Need some ice. Let's move, people.

08:48.793 --> 08:52.991
- Sam, please do something.
- Manticore planted the virus in you?

08:53.073 --> 08:56.986
Targeted to his DNA. We don't know
how much contact it takes to transmit.

08:57.073 --> 09:00.304
- No antidote? No drug therapy?
- Only at Manticore.

09:00.393 --> 09:04.352
OK, whatever it is, there's nothing
you can do to help in here right now.

09:04.433 --> 09:07.869
Why don't you go out
with your friend and wait? Please.

09:09.953 --> 09:12.148
How you doin'?

09:14.513 --> 09:16.981
Logan, it's Sam. Can you hear me?

09:19.113 --> 09:20.944
Logan, hey.

09:21.033 --> 09:23.263
Let's get that IV moving.

09:23.353 --> 09:26.106
Come on, we gotta get
his temperature down.

09:26.193 --> 09:28.787
- Is that IV coming?
- It's open full.

09:58.393 --> 09:59.587
Excuse me, sir.

09:59.673 --> 10:02.551
- What's the rule on fitness time?
- No interruptions.

10:02.633 --> 10:07.753
- Then what are you doing here?
- We've got a lead on a possible code red.

10:09.513 --> 10:12.789
Some fisherman came into dock,
showing off their catch.

10:12.873 --> 10:17.344
- And how is that a code red?
- Apparently they netted a girl. With gills.

10:18.113 --> 10:19.671
Gills.

10:21.233 --> 10:24.908
- They think they have a mermaid.
- Idiots. What'd they do with it?

10:24.993 --> 10:28.781
- We're trying to find out.
- Let me know when they confirm code red.

10:28.873 --> 10:32.468
- Could be some drunks telling fish stories.
- Yes, sir.

10:33.193 --> 10:34.706
Gills.

11:21.273 --> 11:23.582
Please don't let him die.

11:25.393 --> 11:29.466
I know I don't have the right
to ask for a miracle...

11:30.873 --> 11:36.106
because I haven't really been
much of a believer in anything.

11:38.793 --> 11:41.261
But I'm asking now.

11:43.993 --> 11:46.029
I'll do anything.

11:47.913 --> 11:50.632
Please don't let him die.

11:57.433 --> 11:59.344
Max.

12:00.673 --> 12:02.948
He's gonna be OK.

12:04.553 --> 12:07.989
It's chickenpox. Can you believe it?

12:09.273 --> 12:12.902
The doctors couldn't figure it out
because he had it when he was a kid.

12:12.993 --> 12:16.781
Anyway, he's gonna be fine.

12:37.873 --> 12:40.831
No, it's no problem.
You just came in under the wire.

12:40.913 --> 12:43.507
I'll have somebody out there in a jiffy.

12:43.593 --> 12:46.027
You're welcome.
Thanks for using Jam Pony.

12:46.113 --> 12:48.707
- Right, stud, you ready?
- Ladies, here we come.

12:48.793 --> 12:49.353
Hey, hey! I got a pickup, Sector 12.
Here's the address.

12:49.353 --> 12:52.504
Hey, hey! I got a pickup, Sector 12.
Here's the address.

12:52.593 --> 12:55.346
What? Last run's at seven and it's seven.

12:55.433 --> 12:58.550
It's not seven
for another seven seconds.

12:58.633 --> 12:59.907
- Now scram.
- But...

12:59.993 --> 13:03.588
The customer called before closing.
They're getting their pick-up.

13:03.673 --> 13:06.506
If I go out to Sector 12, I'll miss twofers.

13:06.593 --> 13:10.586
If you don't go out to Sector 12,
you'll miss working here! Now bip!

13:10.673 --> 13:13.983
- But twofers...
- Stop saying that. There's no such word.

13:14.073 --> 13:18.430
Actually, there is. You know, twofers.
Two dances for the price of one.

13:18.513 --> 13:22.552
Or two fine ladies dancing simultaneously
for the duration of one song.

13:22.633 --> 13:24.271
Or you can do it that way.

13:24.353 --> 13:27.584
I understand you're going
to a, uh, burlesque hall?

13:27.673 --> 13:30.392
- A strip club, yep.
- And you're coming with us.

13:30.473 --> 13:33.431
- Me? You're inviting me?
- That's why we came over here.

13:33.513 --> 13:34.707
Really?

13:34.793 --> 13:36.624
- Really?
- Really.

13:38.233 --> 13:42.590
- We'll put a rush on this in the morning.
- That's what I'm talkin' about.

13:49.633 --> 13:53.467
Normal, get ready to live.
All right, boys, here we go.

13:53.553 --> 13:58.069
- It's all right. These guys are with me.
- Hey, nice to meet you.

14:19.633 --> 14:22.591
Alec, where've you been? I've missed you.

14:23.153 --> 14:27.749
- You know her?
- Yeah, Virginia. Or Veronica.

14:27.833 --> 14:29.983
Something with a V. Get a dance.

14:30.073 --> 14:33.907
No, we just got here. Besides, I wanna
check out some other chicks first.

14:33.993 --> 14:36.188
Yeah, check her out.

14:45.873 --> 14:50.788
That's what I love about the girls in this place.
Always coming up with new acts.

14:50.873 --> 14:54.582
That's amazing.
How does she breathe in there?

14:54.673 --> 14:59.349
Must be some kind of trick.
I don't see any breathing tubes, though.

14:59.433 --> 15:02.743
Trick or no,
she's the smokin'-est babe here.

15:08.073 --> 15:10.513
Am I right, or is she not your type?

15:10.513 --> 15:11.150
Am I right, or is she not your type?

15:14.793 --> 15:18.069
Yeah, she's my type, all right.

15:21.593 --> 15:25.825
Logan's cousin told me her daughter
just got over a case of chickenpox.

15:25.913 --> 15:28.188
He must've picked it up from her.

15:28.273 --> 15:31.982
He should have immunity
from when he got it as a kid,

15:32.073 --> 15:34.826
but, hey, let's take the win, right?

15:35.993 --> 15:41.021
Anyway, I'm putting him on antivirals.
He should be feeling fine by morning.

15:41.113 --> 15:42.512
Thanks.

15:42.913 --> 15:45.427
Gave you a scare though, huh?

15:45.873 --> 15:48.751
- Yeah.
- Just be careful, all right?

15:49.353 --> 15:53.346
If it'd been this bug Manticore gave you,
I doubt I could've helped him.

15:53.433 --> 15:58.348
That place knew what it was doing. Whatever
they cooked up must be pretty nasty.

15:58.433 --> 16:00.742
I'll be careful.

16:05.793 --> 16:07.272
Hey, Max.

16:09.073 --> 16:10.825
Hey.

16:12.233 --> 16:16.431
Why don't I pull the car around?
I'll meet you guys downstairs.

16:16.513 --> 16:18.231
OK.

16:23.753 --> 16:26.108
You all right?

16:26.193 --> 16:28.309
Am I all right?

16:28.393 --> 16:31.624
Come on. It was just a false alarm.

16:33.433 --> 16:35.822
We got lucky this time.

16:38.473 --> 16:40.065
I gotta go.

16:40.153 --> 16:44.226
You don't have a ride.
We came together, remember?

16:47.073 --> 16:51.225
- I'll walk.
- What, now we can't even be in the same car?

16:52.473 --> 16:54.623
I need to clear my head.

17:19.233 --> 17:23.464
Chickenpox? Thought that went out
with Starbucks and Madonna.

17:25.153 --> 17:26.790
Yeah.

17:38.913 --> 17:41.632
Cheer up. This is good news.

17:42.913 --> 17:45.825
If I tell you something,
promise not to laugh?

17:45.913 --> 17:47.551
Yeah.

17:48.113 --> 17:52.186
At the hospital, I kinda came
across a chapel they got there

17:52.273 --> 17:59.623
and sort of sat down for a minute
and, I don't know, prayed, I guess.

17:59.713 --> 18:03.308
Nothing wrong with that.
Original Cindy prays from time to time.

18:03.713 --> 18:09.106
But, see, I sort of asked for a miracle,
and I know this sounds crazy, but...

18:10.473 --> 18:12.623
I think I sort of got it.

18:12.713 --> 18:14.749
What do you mean? It was chickenpox.

18:14.833 --> 18:18.189
Yeah, but how did Logan pick it up again?

18:18.273 --> 18:24.143
I mean, what if it was me that got him sick,
and, I don't know, something happened?

18:25.593 --> 18:28.232
Like a miracle.

18:30.473 --> 18:33.624
- You promised not laugh.
- I am not laughing.

18:33.713 --> 18:38.389
Either way, it's a second chance,
and those don't come along too often.

18:39.633 --> 18:45.105
I don't wanna risk hurting him again.
But that means not seeing him at all.

18:46.193 --> 18:50.152
What am I supposed to do? Give him up?

18:57.553 --> 18:59.783
Hey.

19:02.953 --> 19:05.342
Is this a bad time?

19:05.433 --> 19:05.633
- What do you want?
- I need you to come somewhere with me.

19:05.633 --> 19:08.989
- What do you want?
- I need you to come somewhere with me.

19:09.073 --> 19:11.462
Can't you see I'm getting ready for a bath?

19:11.553 --> 19:14.863
Women in water seems to be
the theme of my evening. Come on.

19:15.353 --> 19:19.062
Sir, code red's been confirmed.
She's got a Manticore bar code.

19:19.153 --> 19:23.544
- Where did our fisherman take their prize?
- Sold her to a bar in Sector Nine.

19:23.633 --> 19:27.911
- You gotta be kidding me.
- She's on display. Drawing quite a crowd too.

19:28.393 --> 19:32.830
Oh, that's great. I don't want to attract
any more attention to the situation.

19:32.913 --> 19:36.110
- This has to be clean.
- We already have someone in place.

19:43.033 --> 19:46.423
They're passing these out all over.
White's probably onto it.

19:46.513 --> 19:49.744
- We gotta get her out of there.
- No ladies allowed inside.

19:49.833 --> 19:52.108
- Not unless they're working.
- What?

19:52.193 --> 19:57.028
There's a line around back. Girls show up
and the management picks the good ones.

19:57.113 --> 19:59.946
- No way.
- Come on, don't sell yourself short.

20:00.033 --> 20:02.342
- You got a decent shot.
- Forget it.

20:02.913 --> 20:06.349
Fine. Be a prude.
We'll just leave her in there for White.

20:06.433 --> 20:09.903
Step up. Don't be shy.
Your wife ain't inside.

20:09.993 --> 20:15.386
Come on, take a look. Let's go, fellas.
Don't be shy, step up.

20:16.913 --> 20:20.462
Check it out. Splish, splash,
mermaid takin' a bath.

20:20.553 --> 20:24.910
Won't believe your eyes. Come on in.
Get a look at the catch of the day.

20:24.993 --> 20:27.587
You ain't never seen seafood this fresh.

20:34.673 --> 20:37.949
No, not tonight, not tonight, not tonight.

20:38.993 --> 20:40.984
Scram, scram. Get lost.

20:52.913 --> 20:55.985
Show me what you got, girls.
Turn around, turn around.

20:56.073 --> 20:59.349
Nah, nah, come on, scram.
That's it, go home. No more.

20:59.433 --> 21:00.353
Go home. We got all the girls we need.

21:00.353 --> 21:01.752
Go home. We got all the girls we need.

21:01.833 --> 21:05.667
You. Great, sweet.

21:07.833 --> 21:11.951
All right, ladies, get lost.
Time to go home. That's it for the night.

22:23.273 --> 22:26.345
- That's good, sweetie. Thank you.
- But the song isn't over.

22:26.433 --> 22:28.822
You're just so beautiful, I can't take it.

22:28.913 --> 22:31.222
Why don't you go give
my buddies a dance?

22:31.313 --> 22:32.826
Sure.

22:32.913 --> 22:35.507
This is how you rescue a mermaid? Hey!

22:35.593 --> 22:37.982
- White's got someone here.
- Where?

22:39.553 --> 22:41.623
Two o'clock.

22:41.713 --> 22:46.787
See him? No drink, no girls.
He's been casing the place the entire time.

22:46.873 --> 22:48.909
Yep, looks pretty shady to me.

22:50.593 --> 22:54.347
OK, now would be a good time
to look like we belong here.

22:55.473 --> 22:58.192
- Wow, Max. You done this before?
- Shut up.

23:00.033 --> 23:02.627
- Why isn't he making his move?
- Too many people.

23:02.713 --> 23:04.829
- He's waiting for closing.
- Or backup.

23:04.913 --> 23:08.872
Either way, we're not getting her
out of here alive with him around.

23:08.953 --> 23:13.390
- How'd she end up in a dump like this?
- I heard fisherman snagged her.

23:13.473 --> 23:16.393
Once we get her out, we're gonna
have to get her back to the ocean fast.

23:16.393 --> 23:17.712
Once we get her out, we're gonna
have to get her back to the ocean fast.

23:17.793 --> 23:20.512
Maybe the ocean's not the way to go.
What are you doing?

23:20.593 --> 23:24.427
Fitting in. She's Manticore.
She won't let that happen again.

23:24.513 --> 23:28.028
A beautiful girl, alone in the ocean...
She's gonna get Ionely.

23:28.113 --> 23:31.549
- Can we concentrate on a plan?
- I'm thinking. I can talk and think.

23:31.633 --> 23:34.306
- I doubt that.
- You just lost your tip.

24:04.473 --> 24:07.510
- It's a shame.
- It's sick is what it is.

24:07.593 --> 24:11.586
I mean her all alone out there in the ocean,
nothing but fish to talk to.

24:11.673 --> 24:14.790
Give it up, Alec.
The two of you would never work.

24:14.873 --> 24:18.991
Yeah, you're right. I always do this.
I always go for the ones I can't have.

24:19.073 --> 24:21.667
- Figures.
- You should talk.

24:21.753 --> 24:24.950
- Hello? You, Logan, the virus?
- Don't. Don't even.

24:26.073 --> 24:28.109
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, my God.

24:28.193 --> 24:30.388
Max. I didn't know you worked here.

24:30.473 --> 24:32.304
- Actually...
- Just once a week.

24:32.393 --> 24:35.226
- Anyway, we gotta go. We're outta money.
- Already?

24:35.313 --> 24:39.306
Yeah. Normal went kinda nutty
with the honeys. He spent it all.

24:39.393 --> 24:41.623
Anyway, see you later.

24:44.193 --> 24:47.629
- Could this night get any worse?
- Something's going on.

24:48.513 --> 24:50.902
Come on, dance!

24:51.473 --> 24:52.906
Easy, easy.

25:03.393 --> 25:05.702
- Shake it up!
- Come on!

25:08.913 --> 25:10.713
He's making his move.

25:10.713 --> 25:11.225
He's making his move.

25:14.673 --> 25:16.664
OK, go get him.

25:18.913 --> 25:21.507
Hey, pal! He touched my ass!
Get him outta here!

25:21.593 --> 25:23.424
That's it, you're gone.

25:23.513 --> 25:26.505
That's right! This is a decent place!

25:46.113 --> 25:48.104
Little help here!

25:56.913 --> 26:00.701
What the hell is that?
What the hell are those?

26:00.793 --> 26:03.671
Gills. This isn't one of White's guys.

26:09.153 --> 26:11.462
He can't breathe! Help him!

26:35.673 --> 26:37.504
The welts are gone.

26:38.233 --> 26:40.542
Yeah. I feel OK.

26:40.633 --> 26:43.784
Now your fever's gone. Are you hungry?

26:43.873 --> 26:47.991
- I am, actually.
- I'll make you something to eat.

27:04.113 --> 27:06.149
- I'll hit you back in a sec.
- Sorry.

27:11.993 --> 27:14.632
Can you last like this for a little while?

27:17.993 --> 27:20.826
We're gonna find her. Don't worry.

27:23.273 --> 27:25.582
It's gonna be OK.

27:29.313 --> 27:31.304
Keep an eye on him.

27:36.393 --> 27:37.712
Hi.

27:37.793 --> 27:42.947
So, the girl in the tank,
she's just a friend, right?

27:46.993 --> 27:50.872
We thought he was White's guy, but he was
there to get her out. We jammed him up.

27:50.953 --> 27:54.707
- You couldn't have known that.
- Either way, White's got her.

27:54.793 --> 27:58.911
- Where do you think he took her?
- He must have some base in the area.

27:58.993 --> 28:03.111
He's gotta be thinking
Seattle's become Transgenic Central.

28:03.193 --> 28:05.832
And it is his job to kill them.

28:05.913 --> 28:09.542
Even if we track down where he took her,
it might be too late.

28:09.633 --> 28:11.430
He'll wanna study her first.

28:11.513 --> 28:14.903
- Take her to headquarters for analysis.
- Wherever that is.

28:14.993 --> 28:18.269
You can't put a mermaid
on the next plane to Des Moines,

28:18.353 --> 28:21.948
which means he has to arrange
some sort of special transport.

28:22.033 --> 28:24.308
That'll buy us some time, but not much.

28:24.393 --> 28:27.510
- What sector was this bar in?
- Nine. Why?

28:27.593 --> 28:30.744
Maybe I can see if there's any police record

28:30.833 --> 28:33.745
of a military convoy
entering or leaving the area.

28:33.833 --> 28:35.869
Maybe they left a trail.

28:35.953 --> 28:38.751
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:39.473 --> 28:41.225
- Can I see this?
- Yeah.

28:41.313 --> 28:44.544
- I think I got an idea how to fix this tear.
- Cool.

28:48.993 --> 28:52.588
I'm sorry about last night, baby.
I had a situation here at work.

28:53.513 --> 28:55.583
Yeah, I love you, too.

28:57.073 --> 28:59.064
Sure, put him on.

28:59.513 --> 29:01.981
Hey, big man.

29:02.073 --> 29:05.349
You did? Well, that sounds like fun.

29:06.633 --> 29:10.706
Yeah? Yeah, me too.
All right, I'll see you tonight.

29:11.513 --> 29:14.232
I promise. OK.

29:16.193 --> 29:19.663
- How long can it stay alive out of water?
- No way to be sure.

29:19.753 --> 29:23.541
- We arranged to ship her out tonight.
- Keep it alive as long as you can.

29:23.633 --> 29:28.104
The boys in Forensics will wanna
study it before they take it apart.

29:30.993 --> 29:34.668
I wonder what the hell they were smoking
when they cooked this up.

29:34.753 --> 29:39.429
Probably designed for amphibious sabotage.
Laying mines, that kind of thing.

29:39.513 --> 29:43.586
I don't understand how it made it out
of the fire and all the way to the ocean.

29:43.673 --> 29:47.268
There's a stream near Manticore,
dumps into the Duwamish River.

29:51.713 --> 29:53.590
English!

29:54.513 --> 29:58.188
Manticore probably used a computer
interface to communicate with her.

29:58.273 --> 30:03.267
Whatever. I'm not that interested
in what you have to say anyway.

30:23.233 --> 30:27.988
- Sorry about the smell.
- No, this is a really good idea.

30:28.073 --> 30:32.032
There. Let's just let it cool a bit, huh?

30:34.033 --> 30:36.308
Thanks for your help yesterday.

30:37.113 --> 30:40.549
- I'm just glad I was there when you called.
- Me too.

30:40.633 --> 30:44.945
Somebody wanna help with the merman?
The guy has nothing to say. I'm bored.

30:45.473 --> 30:48.112
Come on, help me put this on him.

31:18.353 --> 31:20.344
Find something?

31:20.433 --> 31:21.513
Three identical vans left Sector Nine
after the raid on the bar.

31:21.513 --> 31:24.346
Three identical vans left Sector Nine
after the raid on the bar.

31:24.433 --> 31:27.266
They passed through
the checkpoint of Sector Eleven,

31:27.353 --> 31:30.709
and then moved on to Sector Twelve
a few minutes after that.

31:30.793 --> 31:33.705
- No record of them leaving Sector Twelve?
- Nope.

31:33.793 --> 31:37.911
They're in there somewhere. A lot
of industry was there before the Pulse.

31:37.993 --> 31:41.190
Could be White set up his operation
in an abandoned factory.

31:41.273 --> 31:44.982
- It'll take time to narrow things down.
- We don't have time.

31:45.073 --> 31:50.101
I'm doing the best I can, but to tell you
the truth, I'm not so sure this is a good idea.

31:50.193 --> 31:52.991
- I won't let White have her.
- He could end up with all of you.

31:53.073 --> 31:55.746
That's a risk I'm willing to take.

31:57.353 --> 31:59.548
Help me with this, Logan.

32:07.033 --> 32:09.706
I want this story to have a happy ending.

32:10.633 --> 32:13.352
Yeah, well, you're welcome.

32:14.793 --> 32:16.784
- What's going on?
- He wants out.

32:16.873 --> 32:19.103
- Why?
- Maybe he wants to be in the water

32:19.193 --> 32:21.832
where he can breathe
and no one wants him dead.

32:22.993 --> 32:25.461
Maybe he knows where White's got her.
Come on.

32:32.353 --> 32:35.231
Doesn't look like White's
secret facility to me.

32:35.313 --> 32:37.304
Hey, where you going?

32:38.833 --> 32:42.462
What's it look like? I told you.
He's not gonna die for anybody.

32:42.553 --> 32:46.751
He's going back into the water, swim away,
meet a nice flounder somewhere.

32:50.313 --> 32:52.269
Now what?

33:03.433 --> 33:06.869
- What are those?
- Eggs.

33:06.953 --> 33:10.070
- He's not gonna eat those, is he?
- No, they're hers.

33:12.593 --> 33:14.663
She's your mate, right?

33:16.473 --> 33:18.703
We're gonna get her back.

33:24.953 --> 33:26.352
Yeah?

33:27.073 --> 33:29.268
Logan.

33:29.353 --> 33:30.991
Uh-huh.

33:31.073 --> 33:33.826
I'll say one thing for you:
You got great timing.

33:34.473 --> 33:37.909
- He found White's place?
- Of course. He always does that stuff.

33:37.993 --> 33:40.029
Come on. Let's go get your girl.

34:11.112 --> 34:13.866
It's me. Are you sure this is the place?

34:14.873 --> 34:18.149
Yeah. It's a steam-generating plant,
still operational.

34:18.513 --> 34:21.425
White must've bribed somebody
to let him set up shop.

34:21.513 --> 34:23.231
How do we get in?

34:23.313 --> 34:25.873
Even if you get past the perimeter guards,

34:25.953 --> 34:28.831
gotta figure White's got guys
posted at the entrances.

34:28.913 --> 34:30.824
Guess we go in through the roof.

34:30.913 --> 34:33.746
Can't. Steel fire doors,
only open from inside.

34:34.513 --> 34:36.389
- Great.
- Turn around.

34:37.233 --> 34:40.031
There should be an underwater drain pipe.

34:42.033 --> 34:45.105
- I see bubbles.
- That pipe leads up into the building.

34:46.592 --> 34:49.061
And you got a merman with you,
remember?

34:49.152 --> 34:50.380
Right.

34:51.793 --> 34:53.545
Time to get wet.

34:53.833 --> 34:57.303
- Bring the planks over.
- Think she'll last the whole trip?

34:57.393 --> 35:01.306
It's a freezer car.
She'll do as well as any other fish.

35:01.993 --> 35:04.188
Seal her up.

35:35.953 --> 35:37.784
Come on.

35:45.273 --> 35:47.150
- Don't move.
- Hey.

35:50.393 --> 35:52.509
- Pay attention.
- Got us a gun.

35:52.593 --> 35:54.504
Yippee.

36:00.033 --> 36:03.742
- Tell me you brought a rope.
- Just shut up and climb.

36:32.793 --> 36:36.706
- He should be inside by now.
- Oh, well, we tried. Come on.

36:54.913 --> 36:57.381
This place is huge. She could be anywhere.

37:00.353 --> 37:03.629
- That's her.
- All right, but where's it coming from?

37:18.393 --> 37:23.911
Charlie Six Bravo, report.
Report, Charlie Six Bravo.

37:24.353 --> 37:26.742
Charlie Six Bravo, report.

37:26.833 --> 37:29.433
- What's the problem?
- No response from Charlie Six Bravo.

37:29.433 --> 37:30.912
- What's the problem?
- No response from Charlie Six Bravo.

37:30.993 --> 37:33.348
Call up his eye-cam feed.

37:34.433 --> 37:36.583
Play back the last few minutes.

37:39.313 --> 37:40.985
Freeze it.

37:43.353 --> 37:48.666
Wait a minute. That's 494.
He's supposed to be dead.

37:50.393 --> 37:53.066
And that's 452.

38:03.673 --> 38:06.187
She's in that crate. We gotta get her out.

38:09.913 --> 38:10.948
Come on.

39:07.673 --> 39:09.504
We gotta get out of here.

39:10.713 --> 39:12.669
Not without them.

39:12.753 --> 39:15.267
It's no use. They're penned.

39:16.633 --> 39:18.305
- Cover me.
- What are you doing?

39:18.393 --> 39:21.066
