00:00.474 --> 00:02.138
Previously on life unexpected:

00:02.139 --> 00:04.743
You and someone had a kid.

00:04.744 --> 00:05.799
You gave up that kid.

00:05.800 --> 00:08.911
I am that kid, and now I'm
applying for emancipation.

00:09.355 --> 00:10.539
Cate Cassidy, that's your mom.

00:10.540 --> 00:12.479
Cate Cassidy was
pregnant in high school?

00:12.480 --> 00:12.842
Yes.

00:12.843 --> 00:15.429
Cate and I are back
from our honeymoon.

00:15.430 --> 00:17.599
And we did not
return empty-handed.

00:17.600 --> 00:20.570
We'd like to introduce
the latest addition

00:20.571 --> 00:22.687
to "morning madness,
" Kelly Campbell.

00:22.688 --> 00:24.889
I am not granting
you emancipation.

00:25.059 --> 00:29.096
I'm releasing you back into
their temporary joint custody.

00:29.097 --> 00:30.748
What happened?
She hit me in the head

00:30.749 --> 00:32.148
with a golf ball! Accidentally!

00:32.320 --> 00:34.619
I know you slept with Baze,
and I know you burned down his bar.

00:34.620 --> 00:35.368
I want you gone.

00:35.668 --> 00:37.820
We need a roommate;
you need a room.

00:37.897 --> 00:38.730
That family wants me.

00:38.815 --> 00:40.065
They're three hours away.

00:40.133 --> 00:41.066
Wait, what?

00:41.150 --> 00:42.451
They said I didn't have a choice.

00:42.518 --> 00:43.618
I needed this.

00:44.737 --> 00:47.188
You've met Mr. Daniels.

00:47.240 --> 00:48.407
You're a... teacher.

00:49.295 --> 00:52.026
Your daughter is failing
out of Westmonte.

00:54.380 --> 00:55.397
Eric?

00:55.465 --> 00:57.215
I'm your new tutor.

01:02.472 --> 01:04.539
If you're feeling the chill,
get ready to heat

01:04.590 --> 01:06.608
things up with Ryan and Kelly,
next, on morning madness.

01:06.676 --> 01:08.143
Hey! There you are.

01:08.210 --> 01:10.929
Come on. Hey! We're on in two.

01:11.013 --> 01:13.231
Oh, you are not going
to start the show

01:13.316 --> 01:14.366
with bagel mouth sounds.

01:14.434 --> 01:15.550
Okay. Just out of curiosity,

01:16.184 --> 01:17.119
how long you going
to keep this up?

01:17.186 --> 01:17.971
Keep what up?

01:17.972 --> 01:20.559
This whole type-a producer "hey,
no bagels" thing.

01:20.560 --> 01:22.853
Until corporate forgets that
I was high on my first day

01:22.854 --> 01:25.547
and they see me as a
consummate professional.

01:25.612 --> 01:26.964
So it's gonna be a while, then?

01:27.794 --> 01:29.377
Today's show outline.

01:30.567 --> 01:32.091
So you smooth things
over with Kelly yet?

01:32.092 --> 01:34.478
You know, for the whole golf
ball to the head and stuff?

01:34.655 --> 01:36.205
We're professionals.
I'm sure she's over it.

01:37.505 --> 01:38.739
Morning, everyone.

01:38.740 --> 01:40.467
Lovely to see you, Ryan...

01:40.468 --> 01:41.170
Don...

01:44.308 --> 01:45.150
Jesus.

01:47.749 --> 01:49.951
So, what do we have here?

01:50.452 --> 01:52.638
Ten best places to make out.

01:52.706 --> 01:55.007
That's a bit trite,
don't you think?

01:55.824 --> 01:56.759
We both have a job
to do here, Kelly.

01:56.827 --> 01:59.145
Why don't you just do your job,
and I will do mine.

01:59.213 --> 02:02.048
Let's stick to the outline!

02:02.116 --> 02:04.901
It's the morning minus the madness

02:04.985 --> 02:06.452
with Ryan Thomas
and Kelly Campbell.

02:06.520 --> 02:08.071
Hey, Portland!

02:08.138 --> 02:10.239
It's morning madness
with Kelly and Ryan.

02:10.306 --> 02:13.025
Now today, we are talking about

02:13.093 --> 02:15.227
the best places to make
out in Portland. Ooh.

02:15.279 --> 02:17.196
Ooh. I'll tell you what, Kelly,

02:17.247 --> 02:20.483
I'm gonna start it off with
my favorite spot: Forest park.

02:20.551 --> 02:22.969
Lots of shady areas, and,
uh, well, it's definitely

02:23.036 --> 02:24.604
low on creeps with big overcoats.

02:24.671 --> 02:26.506
Uh, Kelly, what do you think?

02:27.350 --> 02:28.324
Actually, I want to talk about

02:28.392 --> 02:30.333
something that has
more relevance to

02:30.334 --> 02:33.104
people's relationships
than where to kiss.

02:33.670 --> 02:35.884
For example, compatibility.

02:35.885 --> 02:37.624
I wrote a whole chapter about it

02:37.625 --> 02:39.159
in my best-selling book,

02:39.160 --> 02:40.451
you can't have it all,

02:40.837 --> 02:42.939
available online or
anywhere books are sold.

02:56.893 --> 02:57.513
Hey!

02:57.514 --> 02:59.071
Hey. This sugar-loaded crap

02:59.139 --> 03:00.656
is not the breakfast of a winner.

03:00.741 --> 03:01.991
And mud is?

03:02.075 --> 03:03.442
Uh, this is a high-protein shake.

03:03.494 --> 03:04.977
We've got our first
game coming up.

03:05.045 --> 03:07.716
We gotta be in top shape.

03:07.920 --> 03:11.667
Look, Math, I don't want to
overstep as assistant coach.

03:11.752 --> 03:13.619
However, I took the
liberty of adapting

03:13.669 --> 03:15.611
some plays from the u-conn women.

03:15.785 --> 03:17.682
They're on a 78-game
winning streak.

03:17.683 --> 03:19.175
Well, the jv girls'
basketball team

03:19.259 --> 03:20.877
lost every game last season.

03:20.944 --> 03:23.362
Let's have realistic expectations.

03:23.430 --> 03:26.349
Hey. This is Lux's first game,
all right?

03:26.433 --> 03:28.568
I want this to be a positive,
winning experience.

03:28.635 --> 03:31.120
I did not take time off work
to coach a bunch of losers

03:31.188 --> 03:32.155
with "realistic expectations."

03:32.222 --> 03:33.806
It's time for a new attitude.

03:34.321 --> 03:35.289
You're right.

03:36.910 --> 03:39.908
I'm sure all they need
is a new attitude.

03:41.411 --> 03:42.713
S'up, roomies?

03:45.169 --> 03:46.352
S'up...?

03:50.872 --> 03:52.131
When are you gonna do it?

03:53.127 --> 03:53.753
Do what?

03:53.754 --> 03:55.498
Sack up and ask her out?

03:55.991 --> 03:58.235
I don't know. It's awkward.

03:59.289 --> 04:00.183
One, we live together.

04:00.267 --> 04:02.018
And two, you already
hooked up with her.

04:02.506 --> 04:03.756
Look, one, who cares?

04:03.841 --> 04:07.927
And two, I was so drunk
I barely remember it.

04:08.012 --> 04:10.599
Come on. Enough with the
deflecting negative-speak.

04:10.600 --> 04:12.520
You're the one always
telling me to never give up.

04:12.521 --> 04:13.601
This is the week

04:13.602 --> 04:15.248
that losers become winners.

04:15.249 --> 04:17.709
Who said I was a loser? Hey.
Our team is gonna win,

04:17.709 --> 04:19.547
and you are gonna ask Paige out.

04:25.312 --> 04:27.780
Mmm. Tastes like victory.

04:30.451 --> 04:34.721
Denial isn't just a
river in Egypt, ladies.

04:34.788 --> 04:36.158
And that's why I suggest

04:36.159 --> 04:38.607
that you take the 27-point
compatibility questionnaire

04:38.659 --> 04:39.626
that's in my book.

04:39.710 --> 04:41.527
Ryan, this is radio death.

04:41.595 --> 04:43.211
Get the fake virgin to
stop Hawking her book,

04:43.212 --> 04:45.965
and start talking about
something sexy, like sex.

04:46.050 --> 04:48.617
Uh, Kelly, let me, let me
interrupt you for a second here.

04:48.669 --> 04:50.453
Don't you think this
questionnaire is just a little...

04:50.504 --> 04:51.348
a little clinical?

04:51.349 --> 04:52.499
Clinical? Yeah, clinical.

04:52.500 --> 04:55.602
I mean, what about-
what about chemistry? Romance?

04:55.603 --> 04:57.793
And hey... sex.

04:57.961 --> 04:59.996
Sex is in the questionnaire, Ryan.

05:00.064 --> 05:01.564
How often, how varied...

05:01.631 --> 05:03.016
whoa, whoa.

05:03.100 --> 05:05.549
Come on, we are talking
about doing it, here.

05:05.550 --> 05:07.790
We're not talking about uh,
an oil change.

05:07.791 --> 05:10.875
Well, you may mock,
but these clinical details

05:10.876 --> 05:13.582
are a source of contention
for many couples.

05:13.583 --> 05:16.663
Do you and your wife not have
differences when it comes to

05:16.730 --> 05:18.207
"changing your oil," Ryan?

05:18.208 --> 05:21.502
Okay, I'm a big fan of,
uh, frequent servicing.

05:21.503 --> 05:23.688
You know, I like trying
lots of different locations.

05:23.737 --> 05:24.839
Uh-huh, but let me guess:

05:24.840 --> 05:26.078
Your wife thinks

05:26.079 --> 05:29.277
one time and she's good for
another few thousand miles?

05:29.812 --> 05:32.739
Or is Cate more
like an oldsmobile?

05:32.740 --> 05:35.504
Hard to get started
on a cold morning?

05:45.842 --> 05:47.677
Lux, you've been staring

05:47.745 --> 05:49.429
at that practice
test for ten minutes.

05:49.496 --> 05:52.681
The idea of a practice test
is to actually practice.

05:56.487 --> 05:57.503
This is awkward.

05:57.571 --> 06:00.073
You tutoring me?

06:00.157 --> 06:02.241
As I recall, we've had more
awkward moments than this.

06:03.005 --> 06:05.136
Seriously, this-
this tutoring thing,

06:05.137 --> 06:06.647
it's, it's not gonna help.

06:06.648 --> 06:08.605
Okay, yes, it makes sense
when you explain it,

06:08.606 --> 06:11.338
but as soon as I see the test,
I go blank.

06:11.339 --> 06:13.563
Okay. So that blank feeling...

06:14.276 --> 06:17.041
does it feel like nerves?
Pressure?

06:17.042 --> 06:19.354
It feels more like... blank.

06:19.355 --> 06:20.924
Did it start at Westmonte?

06:21.095 --> 06:23.317
Or maybe back at Longfellow?

06:23.990 --> 06:25.817
What? Did you read my file?

06:29.737 --> 06:31.654
A lot of learning issues
are psychological,

06:31.721 --> 06:34.157
so it helps to look
at a student's past

06:34.158 --> 06:35.781
to shed light on their problems.

06:36.361 --> 06:37.274
Problems?

06:37.275 --> 06:39.846
I didn't know that you
were in foster care.

06:39.913 --> 06:41.501
That could explain a lot.

06:43.571 --> 06:45.378
Have you ever missed
a lot of school?

06:50.311 --> 06:52.219
Actually... yeah.

06:52.220 --> 06:54.594
It was this, um, this one time

06:54.595 --> 06:56.088
I was in a car accident.

06:56.089 --> 06:59.174
And I broke my leg and
dislocated my shoulder.

06:59.175 --> 07:01.941
And there was this, this woman,

07:01.942 --> 07:04.383
a nurse, she was
taking care of me.

07:04.676 --> 07:07.539
She was nice, and seemed
like she liked me.

07:08.983 --> 07:09.937
But then...

07:11.990 --> 07:13.309
then it got creepy.

07:13.855 --> 07:15.568
Like she was crazy or something.

07:16.100 --> 07:17.149
Seriously?

07:17.927 --> 07:21.480
Yeah. Yeah, she started
keeping me home from school,

07:21.564 --> 07:23.448
and nobody knew where I was.

07:23.666 --> 07:25.588
She told me to write
these stories.

07:26.769 --> 07:29.968
And she said that she
was my number one fan.

07:35.338 --> 07:36.500
That's the plot of misery.

07:36.501 --> 07:37.135
That's messed up.

07:37.136 --> 07:38.808
Yes, but you bought it.

07:39.004 --> 07:40.934
Okay, look, Eric...

07:41.240 --> 07:44.058
Give it up. There is no deep,
dark secret

07:44.743 --> 07:47.205
that explains why
I suck at school.

07:52.968 --> 07:54.872
Oh, my God!

07:56.516 --> 07:57.431
Tasha?

07:57.432 --> 07:59.965
Wh-when did you get here?

08:00.058 --> 08:01.985
Surprise! Surprise.

08:02.216 --> 08:03.068
I'm back.

08:03.069 --> 08:04.117
For good.

08:11.350 --> 08:20.767
* Bent or broken, it's the family tree *
* Each branch a part of a part of me *

08:20.768 --> 08:25.364
* This is my tree, and it's a beautiful tree. *
Hola! Come pina para un viaje de burro.

08:28.794 --> 08:30.540
I can't even believe this.

08:30.541 --> 08:33.460
What, what happened to Redman,
and being three hours away?

08:33.461 --> 08:34.946
I bailed. Couldn't take it.

08:34.947 --> 08:36.480
I was gonna come
beg you to beg Cate

08:36.548 --> 08:39.450
to let me move in, but fern,
she was a freakin' rock star.

08:39.534 --> 08:41.719
She found me a place,
with this couple, and it sucks.

08:41.785 --> 08:44.438
But whatever, and she
got me into this school.

08:44.489 --> 08:46.084
What? You're kidding!

08:46.085 --> 08:46.757
I know.

08:46.958 --> 08:47.879
I-I was gonna tell you,

08:47.880 --> 08:50.345
but I didn't want to jinx it
until it was all for sure, so.

08:50.378 --> 08:52.270
Oh, my God, we have so
much to catch up on,

08:52.271 --> 08:55.094
but Baze will kill
me if I'm late, so...

08:56.670 --> 08:57.844
Basketball.

08:59.087 --> 09:00.504
Don't even. Oh, yes...

09:01.135 --> 09:03.255
This I gotta see.

09:03.925 --> 09:06.055
All right. Oh! Come on!

09:12.184 --> 09:13.824
Hey, what are you
feelin' for lunch?

09:13.825 --> 09:16.071
I cannot believe that
you took her side.

09:16.655 --> 09:19.190
Mm. Retribution on wheat, my fave.

09:19.792 --> 09:21.325
Look, I didn't take her side,
all right?

09:21.409 --> 09:23.351
We were on air,
and I had to go with it.

09:23.352 --> 09:25.693
She has a serious problem
with female authority.

09:25.694 --> 09:28.032
Or with you calling
her an uptight hag

09:28.116 --> 09:31.168
with plastic boobies that no one
wants to have sex with, on air.

09:31.220 --> 09:32.486
Okay, I got it!

09:32.554 --> 09:34.088
Everything is my fault.

09:34.974 --> 09:36.874
How about you use your
awesome deductive powers

09:36.942 --> 09:38.992
and you help me fix it?
All right, um...

09:39.578 --> 09:41.128
Well, you could do what
Alice did with you.

09:41.179 --> 09:43.013
Just ask her out,
pump her full of vodka,

09:43.098 --> 09:45.216
and kiss her ass until
she does what she's told.

09:45.283 --> 09:46.962
I cannot believe that I
have to cater to this.

09:46.963 --> 09:51.071
I mean, her book is ridiculous.
We do not need a questionnaire

09:51.072 --> 09:53.847
to know how compatible
we are. Right?

09:54.022 --> 09:55.448
Question 14, finance:

09:55.449 --> 09:57.294
Do you prefer separate or
joint checking accounts?

09:57.362 --> 09:58.963
Separate. Joint.

09:59.030 --> 10:01.916
Question 17: Religion.

10:01.983 --> 10:03.350
What are your spiritual beliefs?

10:03.401 --> 10:05.551
Easy; we don't have any.
I'm episcopalian.

10:06.354 --> 10:08.355
This book is stupid. Look...

10:08.406 --> 10:12.459
I don't care if you have, like,
a secret account in the Caymans

10:12.527 --> 10:16.247
or you pray to Elvis,
as long as...

10:16.331 --> 10:17.881
Ooh, we agree to
question number one:

10:17.949 --> 10:20.467
Do you see yourself in a
long-term relationship?

10:21.075 --> 10:22.739
Only with Elvis.

10:23.911 --> 10:25.612
And, let's see,
question number seven:

10:25.613 --> 10:29.110
How many kids do you want?
That is a no-brainer: Six.

10:32.264 --> 10:33.714
One?

10:34.541 --> 10:36.208
Including Lux?

10:36.401 --> 10:37.796
Yeah, funny.

10:40.264 --> 10:41.479
You know, I just saw Kelly.

10:42.060 --> 10:43.333
I am gonna take your advice,

10:43.334 --> 10:45.922
and I'm going to
ask her on a date!

10:52.241 --> 10:53.143
Okay, okay...

10:53.985 --> 10:55.836
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, move it!

10:55.904 --> 10:58.706
Lateral motion, lateral motion.
Move to the side.

10:58.757 --> 11:00.541
Down the line, down the line.

11:00.592 --> 11:02.242
Take a lay-up! There we go.

11:02.294 --> 11:05.396
Okay, we'll get the next one,
we'll get the next one, okay.

11:05.463 --> 11:07.615
Let's move, Lux.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

11:07.682 --> 11:08.849
Chest pass, chest pass.

11:11.019 --> 11:12.436
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's the way...

11:12.504 --> 11:15.239
Whoa! Rose, rose, rose!

11:15.307 --> 11:18.008
It's a basketball,
it's not a javelin. I'm sorry!

11:18.076 --> 11:19.977
Let's not knock Tasha out her
first day of school. Oh, my gosh.

11:20.061 --> 11:21.795
Sorry. Sheesh.

11:21.863 --> 11:24.465
All right, you know what,
everybody, huddle up!

11:24.532 --> 11:25.883
Come on, huddle up.
Math: All right. Let's do this.

11:25.950 --> 11:27.618
You don't mind, right?

11:28.995 --> 11:31.388
Be my guest. Come on, girls.
Come on, bring it in. Bring it in.

11:31.456 --> 11:33.411
Bring it in.
Bring it in, bring it in.

11:34.561 --> 11:36.744
Okay. Tomorrow we are
going into our first game

11:36.795 --> 11:38.078
against the maplewood marmots.

11:38.146 --> 11:39.532
And I know what you're thinking.

11:40.299 --> 11:43.167
They beat you last year in what
some might call a massacre.

11:43.251 --> 11:44.835
I didn't think it
was really that bad.

11:44.919 --> 11:46.119
That's a great attitude.

11:47.258 --> 11:48.277
But seriously,

11:48.278 --> 11:50.924
what is the one thing that we
need to win this game tomorrow?

11:50.975 --> 11:51.875
To be... taller?

11:51.943 --> 11:52.959
It never hurts.

11:53.421 --> 11:53.744
Hand-eye coordination?

11:53.812 --> 11:55.062
That would help.

11:55.129 --> 11:56.430
An exchange program
with an urban school?

11:56.891 --> 11:57.398
Bingo.

11:57.465 --> 11:58.649
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

11:59.275 --> 11:59.892
No.

11:59.967 --> 12:03.821
What we need is a
winner's attitude.

12:05.279 --> 12:08.028
Now look, I may not know much,
but I know this:

12:08.750 --> 12:10.166
I know sports.

12:10.167 --> 12:13.239
And I know that you
guys can do this.

12:13.517 --> 12:15.437
You're a winner. You're a winner.

12:15.438 --> 12:17.341
You are a winner.
You are all winners.

12:17.342 --> 12:19.402
So get out there and practice

12:19.403 --> 12:21.929
like the winners that
you are! Come on!

12:22.086 --> 12:23.104
Come on, wasps!

12:23.715 --> 12:24.809
Come on, ladies!

12:26.612 --> 12:28.370
Lux, look alive.

12:28.947 --> 12:29.814
That was really beautiful.

12:29.815 --> 12:30.471
Thank you.

12:30.472 --> 12:31.472
We're still gonna lose.

12:31.651 --> 12:33.585
Not necessarily, you know.

12:33.636 --> 12:35.587
All we need is a game-changer.

12:36.610 --> 12:38.393
All we need is...

12:39.801 --> 12:40.671
That.

12:44.041 --> 12:44.924
Mother of God.

12:54.935 --> 12:56.676
You got an extra Jersey?

12:57.570 --> 12:59.527
I can't believe Baze
put me on the team.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.082
Oh, please. Did you see his face

13:02.083 --> 13:03.672
when you sunk that three-pointer?

13:03.755 --> 13:05.706
The only time I've ever
seen him that emotional

13:05.774 --> 13:07.790
was when we were watching
Christian the lion.

13:13.315 --> 13:14.365
Yeah, I know. It's bad.

13:16.068 --> 13:17.285
You live here?

13:17.786 --> 13:19.062
You don't have to make
me feel bad about it.

13:19.063 --> 13:19.929
We've had worse.

13:20.550 --> 13:23.415
Do you remember that home you had in,
like, park rose,

13:23.416 --> 13:25.611
where they raised
rabbits for meat?

13:26.321 --> 13:27.593
Finally, you're home.

13:36.655 --> 13:39.703
Do you wanna come in?
Hang a little?

13:40.142 --> 13:43.627
Um. Uh, no, no, I can't,
I actually, I...

13:43.679 --> 13:45.445
I have this practice test

13:45.446 --> 13:48.251
that I'm supposed to take
before tomorrow, but, um...

13:49.078 --> 13:49.314
You know what?

13:49.315 --> 13:51.059
I will just see you
at school. Okay?

14:03.883 --> 14:06.930
Hey. I am so glad that
you were able to make it.

14:08.520 --> 14:09.099
Where's Ryan?

14:09.100 --> 14:11.285
I thought this was a
work-drinks thing.

14:11.286 --> 14:13.536
Um, yeah, you know, I thought
that it could be just us girls.

14:13.537 --> 14:15.896
You know, really just
give us an opportunity

14:15.897 --> 14:19.317
to get to know each other and,
I don't know, uh, relax...

14:19.318 --> 14:21.641
You almost shattered my
skull with a golf ball.

14:21.642 --> 14:23.519
I don't find your
presence very relaxing.

14:24.268 --> 14:26.134
How 'bout drinks all night on me?

14:30.296 --> 14:33.258
What the hell?
I already paid the valet.

14:33.611 --> 14:34.298
Fantastic.

14:34.299 --> 14:36.956
Uh, can we get two champagne
cocktails, please?

14:37.781 --> 14:39.219
Thanks, and keep them coming.

14:41.030 --> 14:42.278
Tasha's like a, like a little

14:42.279 --> 14:43.680
spider monkey on the court.

14:43.681 --> 14:44.931
Look at this shot, though.

14:44.932 --> 14:47.697
Man, even... even rose,
the pink, pink wasp...

14:47.698 --> 14:48.749
she's not so bad.

14:48.750 --> 14:51.111
I can't believe it.
What you said to the team?

14:51.112 --> 14:52.396
It actually took.

14:52.397 --> 14:54.220
I mean, they were
hustling out there today!

14:54.221 --> 14:55.663
Between that and Tasha?

14:56.449 --> 14:57.219
Who knows?

14:57.220 --> 14:58.481
It's winner's attitude, man.

14:58.848 --> 15:00.092
Are you feeling it now?

15:00.093 --> 15:02.088
I am 100% on board.

15:04.429 --> 15:05.783
Then prove it.

15:11.171 --> 15:12.251
Come on.

15:18.417 --> 15:19.263
Get in there!

15:27.293 --> 15:28.281
Hey, Paige.

15:28.478 --> 15:29.262
S'up?

15:29.657 --> 15:33.607
Any, uh, interest in, um,
getting something to eat?

15:34.105 --> 15:35.239
Sure. I could eat.

15:37.225 --> 15:38.314
I'm starving.

15:39.843 --> 15:41.411
Wait, you... you mean right now?

15:41.479 --> 15:42.396
That cool?

15:43.613 --> 15:44.702
Yes!

15:46.034 --> 15:48.464
Totally cool. Absolutely.

15:48.536 --> 15:50.938
If it were any more cool...

15:54.742 --> 15:57.194
 It-it would be less cool.

15:58.092 --> 15:58.598
Okay.

16:00.248 --> 16:01.013
Cool. See ya!

16:05.670 --> 16:06.720
You got this, buddy.

16:08.673 --> 16:10.141
You know, if you'd
told me this morning

16:10.142 --> 16:13.644
that I'd be having a lovely
evening with Cate Cassidy

16:13.711 --> 16:16.180
I would've told you you
were a lying crackhead.

16:18.917 --> 16:19.779
I can't explain it.

16:19.780 --> 16:23.171
I just feel so warm
and connected to you.

16:23.238 --> 16:24.521
Mmm...

16:24.572 --> 16:25.626
I never drink.

16:28.910 --> 16:30.532
Can we get two more, please?

16:32.045 --> 16:32.996
Anyway, I'm sorry

16:33.064 --> 16:34.803
I was such a bitch.

16:35.116 --> 16:36.697
No, no, no. No, no, no.

16:36.698 --> 16:37.893
I was a bitch, okay?

16:37.894 --> 16:40.404
You're not this radio
meat puppet that has to do

16:40.405 --> 16:41.611
whatever I say. No?

16:41.612 --> 16:43.383
You know what the people want.

16:43.675 --> 16:47.010
I'm emotionally remote,
and people think I'm dead inside.

16:47.350 --> 16:48.912
No, you're not
listening to me, okay?

16:48.963 --> 16:50.264
You're this smart,

16:50.348 --> 16:52.582
amazing, educated woman.

16:52.634 --> 16:53.667
I mean, look, you-you...

16:53.668 --> 16:55.358
That whole 29-point thing

16:55.359 --> 16:56.803
you came up with? That is amazing.

16:56.888 --> 16:57.584
27.

16:57.585 --> 16:59.256
Okay, well, whatever.

16:59.772 --> 17:01.424
I-I took your test.

17:01.476 --> 17:02.893
You know, and it...

17:03.818 --> 17:04.928
It turns out that Ryan and I,

17:04.979 --> 17:08.198
we, we do not agree
on major issues.

17:08.682 --> 17:09.912
Like what?

17:10.936 --> 17:13.993
Uh, like-like finances.

17:16.977 --> 17:18.208
And kids, you know?

17:18.276 --> 17:20.661
Ryan? He wants a pile and...

17:21.876 --> 17:24.428
Surprise, I don't want any.

17:24.999 --> 17:26.852
So, how'd you work through that?

17:28.920 --> 17:31.221
The point is...

17:31.279 --> 17:33.600
That through taking your
test I just realized...

17:33.601 --> 17:35.803
and as much as I don't even
really want to admit this...

17:35.804 --> 17:37.942
you do know what
you're talking about.

17:40.790 --> 17:43.852
You know, I-I... I've never
had many girlfriends.

17:45.907 --> 17:47.483
Most women find me judgmental

17:47.484 --> 17:48.542
and prissy.

17:49.641 --> 17:51.169
We are friends, right?

17:53.506 --> 17:54.502
Absolutely.

17:55.503 --> 17:56.816
You know, and as friends,

17:56.817 --> 17:58.322
we really should

17:58.323 --> 17:59.841
just work better together.

18:00.273 --> 18:02.688
I'm-I'm going to be
more open to your ideas,

18:02.689 --> 18:03.569
and you could,

18:03.933 --> 18:07.896
you know, just stick to the outline,
as a favor to me.

18:09.851 --> 18:11.172
Your friend.

18:13.242 --> 18:14.914
You've got it, girlfriend.

18:19.594 --> 18:22.029
Mmm.

18:22.096 --> 18:23.898
I have to use the
little virgins' room.

18:24.332 --> 18:25.046
Okay.

18:28.403 --> 18:29.843
We're going to need a cab.

18:30.438 --> 18:32.046
I think I'm gonna hurl.

18:32.387 --> 18:34.243
Two cabs. Yeah.

18:36.678 --> 18:38.505
Wow.

18:38.992 --> 18:41.146
These stairs are hard sober.

18:43.885 --> 18:45.438
What are you still doing up?

18:46.504 --> 18:47.712
Couldn't sleep.

18:48.080 --> 18:50.081
Why? What? Are you okay?
What happened?

18:51.850 --> 18:53.314
Yeah. It's nothing.

18:54.080 --> 18:55.297
It doesn't look like nothing.

18:59.753 --> 19:01.343
It's...

19:02.997 --> 19:04.040
It's Tasha.

19:06.823 --> 19:08.577
I saw her new foster home.

19:08.645 --> 19:09.301
And what?

19:09.302 --> 19:11.471
Is it not going to last?
Is it bad? What is it?

19:14.346 --> 19:15.919
I don't want her there,

19:16.786 --> 19:19.433
but if it doesn't work out,
she's gone.

19:20.022 --> 19:22.829
Another three hours away,
or-or worse.

19:22.959 --> 19:23.565
All right, well,

19:23.566 --> 19:26.385
Lux, look, you know,
if-if she gets stuck,

19:26.386 --> 19:29.127
or if she can't take it, you know,

19:29.128 --> 19:31.485
or if she gets kicked out,
we will...

19:32.280 --> 19:33.466
Figure something out.

19:34.037 --> 19:36.077
Figure something out, like how?

19:36.389 --> 19:37.780
Like...

19:39.676 --> 19:42.250
Maybe... maybe she
could live here?

19:42.981 --> 19:45.798
Yeah, you know, I mean,
if it... if it came to that.

19:55.419 --> 19:56.674
Hey. What are you doing here?

19:57.642 --> 19:58.351
Saving you.

20:00.363 --> 20:01.758
We're getting you kicked out.

20:01.759 --> 20:02.703
Are you crazy?

20:02.704 --> 20:05.134
No. Where am I going to go?

20:05.135 --> 20:08.506
Cate promised me last night
that if you were ever in a jam,

20:08.507 --> 20:09.905
she'd take you in.

20:15.845 --> 20:17.296
Let's put me in a jam.

20:26.696 --> 20:28.617
Good morning, compatriots.

20:28.618 --> 20:30.268
Cate, you look lovely today.

20:31.915 --> 20:33.005
Um, I brought you

20:33.006 --> 20:34.547
a salmon bagel.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.969
Um, this is the...

20:39.428 --> 20:42.263
Outline for today's show.

20:42.264 --> 20:43.854
Looking forward to it.

20:45.594 --> 20:46.944
Hey, Portland.
You're joining the madness

20:47.029 --> 20:48.766
with Ryan and Kelly.

20:48.767 --> 20:51.373
Today's topic is make-up sex.

20:51.543 --> 20:53.525
Is it worth the arguing?

20:54.015 --> 20:55.825
Okay, so Kelly, uh, making love

20:55.826 --> 20:57.876
to make peace? Yea or nay?

20:57.877 --> 21:01.929
Definite yea, but sex is not a
solution for weightier issues.

21:01.930 --> 21:03.461
Well, maybe not for you since
you're not getting any,

21:03.545 --> 21:05.774
but for the rest of us... so,
really? You're telling me

21:05.775 --> 21:08.082
that you think that
sex could solve all

21:08.133 --> 21:09.400
of your problems with Cate?

21:09.468 --> 21:10.058
Yes.

21:10.669 --> 21:11.821
What about finances?

21:11.822 --> 21:13.593
Yeah. What about your family?

21:13.594 --> 21:15.515
Well, okay, look. I-I defy you

21:15.516 --> 21:17.978
to name a problem with my
marriage that sex can't fix.

21:17.979 --> 21:19.827
What about not wanting kids?

21:20.303 --> 21:21.614
That's a big issue.

21:21.615 --> 21:24.335
You want a litter,
and Cate said, without a doubt,

21:24.336 --> 21:25.592
that she doesn't want...

21:29.187 --> 21:30.490
Any.

21:46.351 --> 21:47.116
Hey, hey.

21:47.117 --> 21:49.331
You have a good night? Oh,
not just good.

21:49.332 --> 21:52.168
It was amazing.

21:52.169 --> 21:53.836
Paige is amazing.

21:53.920 --> 21:55.621
Want to know the moment
I knew she was amazing?

21:55.706 --> 21:57.673
Uh, when she did a shot
without using her hands?

21:58.886 --> 22:00.242
When she ordered the Halibut

22:00.293 --> 22:02.611
and asked if I knew
it was sustainable.

22:04.580 --> 22:06.110
Not where I thought you
were going with that.

22:06.111 --> 22:10.414
Not only is she beautiful and
funny and smells like candy,

22:10.415 --> 22:12.110
she's ecologically conscious.

22:12.529 --> 22:14.330
And that's not even the best part.

22:14.331 --> 22:15.655
Guess what happened afterwards.

22:16.278 --> 22:18.002
You guys talked about
renewable energy?

22:18.230 --> 22:19.380
We kissed.

22:20.783 --> 22:23.782
That's what I'm talking about.

22:24.069 --> 22:25.570
Math.

22:25.637 --> 22:26.605
If it wasn't for you,

22:26.606 --> 22:28.239
I wouldn't have
even asked her out.

22:28.323 --> 22:31.042
You are so right about
having a winner's attitude.

22:31.052 --> 22:31.955
Tonight's game?

22:31.956 --> 22:34.250
We are kicking ass
and taking names.

22:34.263 --> 22:35.263
Boom. I love it.

22:35.330 --> 22:36.372
I love it.

22:38.617 --> 22:39.634
Don't forget your smoothie.

22:39.701 --> 22:40.701
Thank you, sir.

22:40.752 --> 22:42.386
Have a good day.

22:44.006 --> 22:46.174
Look at that guy.

22:46.225 --> 22:48.576
Psst.

22:48.644 --> 22:50.211
Is he gone?

22:50.262 --> 22:52.280
What are you...
What are you doing?

22:52.347 --> 22:54.765
Why are you always half naked?

22:54.850 --> 22:57.351
Well, I was in the bathroom,
and I came out, and I saw Math

22:57.402 --> 22:58.836
so I ducked back in.

22:58.904 --> 23:00.721
I've been trapped in
there all morning.

23:00.772 --> 23:02.310
I thought last night was amazing.

23:02.311 --> 23:03.421
It was a disaster.

23:03.422 --> 23:04.892
Ugh. He talked about breadsticks

23:04.943 --> 23:05.952
for 20 minutes.

23:05.953 --> 23:07.394
He-he likes breadsticks.

23:07.637 --> 23:09.481
I had to kiss him
just to end the date.

23:11.490 --> 23:12.376
Why did...?

23:12.377 --> 23:14.447
You didn't have to
kiss him, Paige.

23:14.448 --> 23:16.039
You gave him the wrong idea.

23:16.040 --> 23:19.672
Uh, no. You are the one
that told him to ask me out.

23:19.673 --> 23:21.576
So if anyone gave
him the wrong idea,

23:21.577 --> 23:23.319
it was you. No.

23:23.600 --> 23:24.828
No, this is not my problem.

23:24.829 --> 23:26.635
If you're not into the guy,
you got to tell him...

23:26.720 --> 23:28.437
And very gently.
He is a delicate flower.

23:28.522 --> 23:29.604
I am a virgo, okay?

23:29.605 --> 23:31.497
We are not good at
awkward conversations.

23:32.805 --> 23:33.966
Maybe you could talk to him?

23:34.160 --> 23:35.882
Yes, yes, yes.

23:35.883 --> 23:37.759
Because that way,
you know, it wouldn't be

23:38.156 --> 23:39.236
all weird around here.

23:39.237 --> 23:40.753
Or at the game later today.

23:41.201 --> 23:42.883
You-you're going to Lux's game?

23:43.083 --> 23:43.936
With Ryan.

23:44.474 --> 23:46.969
Sporting events are great
places to meet guys.

23:50.577 --> 23:51.868
Ryan?

23:52.963 --> 23:54.896
God. Okay? You just
stormed out of there.

23:55.574 --> 23:57.833
Would you please just give
me a chance to explain?

23:57.918 --> 24:00.285
Explain what? Huh?

24:00.337 --> 24:01.637
That you're telling a
co-worker something

24:01.689 --> 24:02.671
you haven't told me yet?

24:02.756 --> 24:04.322
Or that you don't want kids?

24:04.691 --> 24:05.602
All right, look.

24:05.603 --> 24:07.390
It shouldn't have
come out like that.

24:07.996 --> 24:09.754
You know, Kelly,
she shouldn't have said anything.

24:09.755 --> 24:11.854
Oh, okay. So now
it's Kelly's fault?

24:12.671 --> 24:15.238
Do you want to take any
responsibility for anything?

24:15.239 --> 24:16.350
Like these papers?

24:18.989 --> 24:20.941
Fern was dropping them
off when I pulled up.

24:20.942 --> 24:23.804
Apparently, Tasha got kicked out
of her foster home this morning

24:23.805 --> 24:25.534
and you agreed to take her in?

24:25.984 --> 24:26.998
Without asking me.

24:27.113 --> 24:28.013
No...

24:29.583 --> 24:31.333
We... Lux and I-
we talked about it.

24:31.418 --> 24:33.786
Mm-hmm? Apparently you did
a little more than that,

24:33.853 --> 24:35.371
because fern thinks
it's a done deal.

24:35.438 --> 24:38.424
Ryan, I had had an entire
bottle of champagne.

24:38.491 --> 24:40.626
I wasn't thinking clearly.
So now it's the champagne's fault?

24:40.677 --> 24:42.735
I told her that I
would take Tasha in

24:42.736 --> 24:44.591
if where she was
living didn't work out.

24:44.592 --> 24:46.273
I never... I never even thought

24:46.274 --> 24:49.334
that she was going to get,
you know, kicked out.

24:49.386 --> 24:51.307
You know, did it ever occur to you

24:51.308 --> 24:53.489
that I may not want
to take Tasha in?

24:53.556 --> 24:55.357
Huh? You know,

24:55.978 --> 24:56.685
you're so used to

24:56.686 --> 24:58.110
getting your way.

24:58.177 --> 25:01.013
I forgave you for Baze.

25:01.064 --> 25:04.533
I mean, I-I-I was willing
to rush our own wedding

25:04.618 --> 25:06.151
because that's what you wanted.

25:06.202 --> 25:09.154
I mean, hell, I-I even
looked the other way

25:09.205 --> 25:11.006
when Baze tried to
bum-rush our vows.

25:11.074 --> 25:12.875
We are married now, Cate.

25:12.959 --> 25:15.044
You can't just make these
life-altering decisions

25:15.128 --> 25:16.862
and then go discuss
them with someone else

25:16.930 --> 25:19.164
before telling me.
I mean, you ever think

25:19.215 --> 25:20.799
that the next kid that
comes in this house

25:20.867 --> 25:22.618
I might want to be mine?

25:22.686 --> 25:24.253
I want kids, Cate.

25:28.391 --> 25:29.725
We already have a kid.

25:32.829 --> 25:34.897
Lux isn't my kid.

25:39.154 --> 25:39.768
You know what?

25:39.769 --> 25:41.962
This is actually, um...

25:44.102 --> 25:45.428
It's actually very simple.

25:48.791 --> 25:50.886
You either want to have a
kid with me or you don't.

25:51.731 --> 25:54.114
And if you don't,
then I-I-I don't know

25:54.115 --> 25:56.522
why we got married
in the first place.

26:15.009 --> 26:15.655
That's all right, girls.

26:15.656 --> 26:17.739
Let's be strong on "d."
You got this.

26:20.977 --> 26:22.077
Come on.

26:24.227 --> 26:26.050
Let's go, wasps. Give 'em...

26:26.348 --> 26:26.957
Misery.

26:30.140 --> 26:32.578
Okay, come on.
You got it. You got it.

26:33.823 --> 26:35.243
All right, girls.
Let's be strong on "d."

26:35.493 --> 26:36.077
You got this.

26:40.183 --> 26:41.183
Two points, marmots.

26:46.840 --> 26:49.225
Let's go, Tash. Let's do this.

26:52.829 --> 26:54.113
Hey. Talk to Cate?
We're set, right?

26:54.197 --> 26:55.581
Cause fern went to
get all my stuff...

26:56.327 --> 26:57.199
Tasha!

26:57.250 --> 26:58.367
Yeah. Let's go.

27:03.340 --> 27:04.723
Two more points for the marmots.

27:04.791 --> 27:06.258
Yes!

27:10.013 --> 27:11.765
I told her about the game,
and she's here.

27:11.766 --> 27:13.009
That means something, right?

27:14.801 --> 27:18.070
I don't think you should keep
pursuing Paige, because...

27:20.323 --> 27:21.060
Because why?

27:24.200 --> 27:26.031
Because I might still be into her.

27:26.032 --> 27:26.856
What? Yeah, you know.

27:26.857 --> 27:29.626
I mean, I did... I did...
I did get there first, so...

27:32.593 --> 27:34.297
There's no dibs in dating.

27:34.298 --> 27:36.966
You can't call
takebacks or shotgun.

27:37.615 --> 27:40.249
Come on. Pass, pass, pass, pass.

27:40.301 --> 27:41.918
Rose!

27:41.969 --> 27:43.736
Rose!

27:43.804 --> 27:45.645
Come on, rose!

27:45.806 --> 27:46.889
I'm sorry.

27:46.957 --> 27:48.374
God.

27:48.442 --> 27:49.425
I can't believe you.

27:49.476 --> 27:50.533
She had a clear shot!

27:50.534 --> 27:51.827
You're jealous. What?

27:51.828 --> 27:54.564
You had a cheap one-night stand
with Paige, and now that you see

27:54.631 --> 27:56.446
she and I might have something special,
you can't take it.

27:56.447 --> 27:58.434
I promise you, that is not it.

27:59.077 --> 28:00.500
You're so used to being
the guy in high school

28:00.501 --> 28:02.151
who gets all the girls
and calls all the shots.

28:02.152 --> 28:04.472
Hell, you won't even let
me coach my own team.

28:04.742 --> 28:06.790
You always have to be
the star, don't you?

28:06.791 --> 28:08.576
Well, not tonight.
Tonight, I get the girl,

28:08.577 --> 28:09.817
and I call the shots.

28:10.948 --> 28:14.033
Time. Sub. Tasha,
you're on the bench.

28:16.537 --> 28:18.788
Hey, so we're all good,
right? With Cate?

28:19.727 --> 28:21.254
Lux, get in there.

28:24.762 --> 28:27.180
Ryan: Okay, Lux.
Come on. We got this.

28:27.264 --> 28:28.831
13, Lux Cassidy.

28:28.882 --> 28:30.883
All right! All right, wasps!

28:30.968 --> 28:32.468
Let's get it.

28:32.519 --> 28:33.366
Oh! Hey!

28:33.367 --> 28:35.838
Good shot. Good shot, Lux.

28:43.464 --> 28:44.513
Can we talk?

28:55.492 --> 28:57.674
I wasn't expecting
to see you here.

28:58.045 --> 28:59.866
Well, I wasn't going to
miss Lux's first game.

29:00.464 --> 29:02.169
Even though she's not your kid?

29:06.381 --> 29:07.928
I'm sorry it came out like that.

29:07.929 --> 29:09.484
I'm the one that should be sorry.

29:09.485 --> 29:11.562
Because I've been secretly
afraid that what we want...

29:11.563 --> 29:13.357
it might not be compatible.

29:15.814 --> 29:17.768
You know, when Lux came around,

29:17.769 --> 29:20.197
I just assumed that
she would be our kid.

29:21.870 --> 29:23.203
That that would be enough.

29:23.204 --> 29:25.504
Cate, it's not that
Lux isn't enough.

29:25.762 --> 29:27.616
No matter how close she and I get,

29:28.803 --> 29:30.836
I'm the guy on the outside.

29:32.874 --> 29:35.346
I'm never going to be the dad

29:35.347 --> 29:36.957
that-that gets invited
to career day.

29:36.958 --> 29:40.163
Or-or gets to give her
away at her wedding.

29:41.390 --> 29:44.308
I'm the guy sitting up
in the nosebleed section,

29:44.359 --> 29:45.427
just watching.

29:46.688 --> 29:49.576
Cate, if I could be that
guy to Lux, I would be.

29:50.732 --> 29:52.883
But she's got Baze.
And I see what they have.

29:52.884 --> 29:54.570
I see what you all have.

29:58.164 --> 29:59.440
That's all I want.

30:00.995 --> 30:02.468
Just to have that, too.

30:07.238 --> 30:08.701
You know, the first
time I got pregnant,

30:08.702 --> 30:11.324
it wasn't the best experience.

30:14.249 --> 30:18.267
I was really scared.
And I was alone, so...

30:18.268 --> 30:19.977
I was just doing... Cate, Cate, Cate.
You're not alone this time.

30:20.044 --> 30:21.845
I know that I'm not.
I know I'm not.

30:23.406 --> 30:24.613
I do. I want kids.

30:24.614 --> 30:26.740
I just... it's taking me a
little while to come around,

30:26.741 --> 30:28.953
and I just don't want to lose you,
Ryan. I don't.

30:29.733 --> 30:31.172
Look, I don't know
what getting pregnant

30:31.173 --> 30:33.132
is going to be like.
I don't even know if I can.

30:33.133 --> 30:34.707
Cate, I just want to try.

30:38.977 --> 30:39.717
Okay.

30:41.680 --> 30:43.511
Okay.

30:43.814 --> 30:45.981
All right, then let's do that.

30:46.032 --> 30:47.849
Let's try.

31:14.559 --> 31:15.288
Sub!

31:16.015 --> 31:17.182
I think I broke my butt.

31:17.972 --> 31:18.957
I don't think you broke your butt.

31:18.958 --> 31:20.152
Get in, Tasha. Tasha, get in.

31:20.236 --> 31:20.937
No!

31:21.800 --> 31:23.810
Rose, you're up. Whoa, whoa.
Wait a second. Hold on.

31:23.811 --> 31:24.812
Look at the score.

31:24.857 --> 31:26.645
We need someone who can
actually drive the ball.

31:26.646 --> 31:28.389
I'm calling the shots, remember?

31:28.761 --> 31:30.286
Rose, get in there now.

31:30.530 --> 31:31.980
Can you focus on the game?

31:32.031 --> 31:33.168
For the sake of the team?

31:33.169 --> 31:34.482
You don't give a
crap about the team.

31:34.534 --> 31:35.667
All you care about is winning.

31:35.751 --> 31:37.669
And somehow thinking
you're a winner

31:37.737 --> 31:39.507
and I'm a loser makes
you feel better.

31:39.508 --> 31:41.189
I don't think that
you're a loser, Math.

31:41.190 --> 31:42.808
It's Paige, okay? It isn't me.

31:42.809 --> 31:44.459
She is not interested in you.

31:44.510 --> 31:47.332
Right. She kissed me because
she's not interested.

31:47.333 --> 31:49.062
She kissed you to end the date.

31:50.493 --> 31:51.767
That's what she told me.

32:01.745 --> 32:02.521
Math.

32:03.571 --> 32:04.202
Math.

32:05.674 --> 32:06.815
You're taking this really hard.

32:06.866 --> 32:08.615
She was out of his league.

32:09.035 --> 32:09.844
Tash...

32:10.453 --> 32:12.281
That's not what this is about.

32:14.340 --> 32:15.986
You can't come to live at Cate's.

32:16.478 --> 32:17.198
What?

32:17.668 --> 32:20.069
They said no. Ryan.

32:20.070 --> 32:21.264
Ryan said no.

32:22.331 --> 32:23.813
I'm so sorry.

32:27.493 --> 32:28.424
Tash...

32:32.961 --> 32:34.014
Lux, I need your cell phone.

32:34.015 --> 32:36.792
I'm gonna call Valerie and
beg her to take me back.

32:36.793 --> 32:38.006
No, Tash, you can't.

32:38.501 --> 32:40.615
We have to tell her that the
spray paint was your idea, okay?

32:40.616 --> 32:42.483
Otherwise, she'll never,
ever say yes.

32:49.207 --> 32:50.486
Everyone, come here.

32:53.327 --> 32:56.028
Hey, I'm sorry for acting so
unprofessionally out there.

32:56.113 --> 32:57.384
And, um...

32:58.415 --> 33:02.118
Well, I'm really sorry about
lying to you about our chances.

33:02.185 --> 33:03.745
You know, I guess...

33:05.133 --> 33:07.667
I guess I didn't think you
guys could deal with the truth.

33:07.874 --> 33:09.245
And the truth is...

33:09.793 --> 33:11.281
Well, Tricia?

33:11.678 --> 33:12.916
You're not gonna lose the weight

33:12.917 --> 33:14.927
by homecoming.
It's physically impossible.

33:14.928 --> 33:15.854
And Math...

33:16.877 --> 33:18.379
Paige isn't interested in you.

33:18.635 --> 33:19.341
I'm sorry.

33:19.342 --> 33:20.205
And if it makes you
feel any better,

33:20.206 --> 33:21.994
she's not interested in me,
either.

33:23.278 --> 33:24.298
And team?

33:25.559 --> 33:27.163
We're just not good.

33:28.117 --> 33:30.433
But none of that means that
you guys should give up.

33:31.321 --> 33:34.758
Because Tricia, you are going
to lose that weight by prom.

33:35.953 --> 33:36.985
And Math,

33:37.521 --> 33:40.562
you are going to find a girl
who is interested in you.

33:41.727 --> 33:42.571
And team?

33:43.293 --> 33:44.994
We are going to keep trying,

33:45.045 --> 33:45.932
because even if there was

33:45.933 --> 33:48.066
a 99% chance of us losing,

33:48.585 --> 33:50.543
that's what winning is, all right?

33:50.544 --> 33:52.501
It's not what is on the scoreboard

33:52.502 --> 33:53.725
at the end of this game.

33:53.726 --> 33:56.110
Winning is knowing

33:56.111 --> 33:57.741
that we have each other's backs

33:57.999 --> 34:00.434
and that we are going to
take care of each other.

34:01.207 --> 34:02.264
On the court...

34:03.613 --> 34:04.495
And off.

34:06.062 --> 34:08.574
So, ladies,

34:08.574 --> 34:11.420
what I would like you to
do is get your game on.

34:11.420 --> 34:12.998
And I want you to go out there.

34:13.000 --> 34:16.248
And I want you to give these
marmots a run for their money!

34:24.568 --> 34:26.250
Hey, um, Tash?

34:26.251 --> 34:26.752
Yeah?

34:28.255 --> 34:30.489
Uh...

34:30.556 --> 34:33.559
I lived with Valerie.

34:35.053 --> 34:37.853
Okay? I-I know I should
have told you right away.

34:38.967 --> 34:42.003
I was 12 or-or 13.

34:42.849 --> 34:43.853
It was when you went
back with your mom,

34:43.920 --> 34:45.920
and we weren't
really talking much.

34:45.989 --> 34:48.440
And Valerie...

34:48.507 --> 34:51.760
She doesn't have a
maternal bone in her body.

34:52.512 --> 34:53.473
And being at that house

34:53.474 --> 34:58.632
might seem okay right now,
but it gets bad.

34:59.300 --> 35:00.584
Fast.

35:02.656 --> 35:03.729
Bad how?

35:10.797 --> 35:12.281
Okay. Forget it. You don't...

35:12.332 --> 35:14.382
You don't have to explain.

35:14.383 --> 35:16.549
If you don't want me there,
I'm gone, okay?

35:16.570 --> 35:19.096
Yeah, but I don't... I don't
want them to send you away.

35:19.097 --> 35:21.371
I mean, I just got you back.

35:21.808 --> 35:23.761
I'll-I'll find a
way to stay, okay?

35:24.311 --> 35:26.270
I'm not going anywhere.

35:30.502 --> 35:32.054
Winner's attitude, right?

35:38.851 --> 35:41.410
All right, ladies. Let's get it up

35:41.411 --> 35:42.631
for the second half.

35:43.239 --> 35:45.183
I want hooting. I want hollering.

35:45.184 --> 35:47.460
And let's take it
to these marmots!

35:47.592 --> 35:49.538
Let's go, guys. Let's go.

35:58.137 --> 35:59.654
There you go!

36:07.129 --> 36:08.480
Get that ball.

36:21.389 --> 36:25.329
Set the pick! Good, good, rose.

36:41.063 --> 36:43.915
It's good! Three points, wasps.

37:17.526 --> 37:21.760
Final score, 53 to three, marmots.

37:26.208 --> 37:27.325
There's something called

37:27.409 --> 37:28.640
independent living,

37:28.641 --> 37:30.995
which I know both you and
Lux are familiar with.

37:31.063 --> 37:32.108
Yeah. Of course.

37:32.109 --> 37:34.132
You said that
wouldn't work for me.

37:34.200 --> 37:36.878
Well, it was my opinion that
there wasn't anyone qualified

37:36.879 --> 37:38.784
or dedicated enough
to supervise you...

37:39.040 --> 37:40.129
Until now.

37:40.723 --> 37:42.859
It'll have to be made
official by a judge tomorrow,

37:42.860 --> 37:44.898
but Cate and Ryan have
received verbal approval

37:44.899 --> 37:47.077
from the state to fill that role.

37:49.465 --> 37:50.459
Are you kidding me?

37:51.083 --> 37:53.286
I'm going to have my own place?

37:53.287 --> 37:55.420
We're going to find you
an apartment nearby.

37:55.421 --> 37:57.383
You'll get a stipend
for housing and food,

37:57.384 --> 38:00.014
which should be plenty,
if you manage your money well.

38:00.232 --> 38:02.410
But Cate and Ryan can
co-sign your lease,

38:02.478 --> 38:04.031
they can be your
emergency contact,

38:04.032 --> 38:06.710
and they can help with utilities,
a cell phone...

38:06.711 --> 38:08.702
Yeah. We're here for you.
I mean, whatever you need.

38:09.557 --> 38:12.100
I can't believe you guys
would do that for me.

38:16.561 --> 38:17.560
I can.

38:26.958 --> 38:28.487
Thanks again, fern.

38:28.488 --> 38:29.370
Oh, you're welcome.

38:29.438 --> 38:32.440
It is great to see
you doing so well.

38:34.727 --> 38:36.763
Well, it seems that Cate's house

38:36.764 --> 38:39.152
is in much better
shape than Valerie's.

38:40.040 --> 38:41.261
I wouldn't know.

38:42.867 --> 38:47.212
You know, she mentioned that
you lived there... Valerie...

38:48.052 --> 38:50.814
that she fostered you
for almost two years.

38:50.815 --> 38:53.091
Obviously, I wasn't your
case worker back then,

38:53.092 --> 38:56.409
but I'm surprised you
didn't say anything.

38:57.109 --> 38:59.922
It's just another place
not worth mentioning.

38:59.969 --> 39:01.432
Lux...

39:03.197 --> 39:05.379
She wanted me to give this to you.

39:07.021 --> 39:09.470
She said that she thought
of you as a daughter.

39:10.529 --> 39:11.538
I checked into it,

39:11.539 --> 39:14.661
and she'd started the
process of adopting you.

39:15.632 --> 39:18.405
Although, in the end,
she said that it didn't work out.

39:21.101 --> 39:22.999
I should go back inside.

39:40.759 --> 39:42.303
I think we just
proved Kelly wrong.

39:42.304 --> 39:43.071
Yeah.

39:44.013 --> 39:45.900
Yes, mind-blowing make-up sex...

39:45.901 --> 39:48.349
It can fix any marital issue.

39:49.280 --> 39:51.085
Well, the flowers are nice. Yeah.

39:51.153 --> 39:54.185
Kelly... she must have really
felt bad to send those.

39:54.440 --> 39:55.973
Hey, you know,
why don't you, um...

39:56.058 --> 39:57.525
Why don't you call her
and just, you know,

39:57.592 --> 39:59.193
tell her everything's okay?

39:59.253 --> 40:00.193
Yeah.

40:01.881 --> 40:04.565
Or I can just let her
worry for a little longer.

40:09.025 --> 40:10.437
So we're really doing it, huh?

40:10.438 --> 40:11.478
Trying for a baby?

40:12.922 --> 40:14.092
Yeah, apparently.

40:14.276 --> 40:17.014
So you're gonna stop
drinking champagne,

40:17.015 --> 40:18.842
go off the pill?

40:19.052 --> 40:22.107
After my night out with Kelly,
I can barely look at champagne.

40:22.658 --> 40:23.104
Well, I'll tell you what.

40:23.105 --> 40:26.736
I will put the rest of
that back in the fridge.

40:27.284 --> 40:29.294
Trying for a baby
is going to be fun.
