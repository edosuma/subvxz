00:03.090 --> 00:05.440
Hey, you guys have any
plans for Valentine's Day?

00:05.483 --> 00:07.268
Three months from now? No.

00:07.311 --> 00:09.009
What? No?I mean,

00:09.052 --> 00:12.012
secret romantic plans that
would be ruined if I told you.Oh.

00:13.622 --> 00:15.406
What's going on, Raj?

00:15.450 --> 00:17.495
Well, how would
you guys feel

00:17.539 --> 00:19.410
about going to India
for my wedding?

00:19.454 --> 00:21.978
Oh, that's so exciting!

00:22.022 --> 00:24.285
Penny, you will never guess
what I have planned

00:24.328 --> 00:27.114
for Valentine's Day.Uh-huh.

00:27.157 --> 00:29.464
Can I feed peanuts to
the elephants at your wedding?

00:29.507 --> 00:32.336
That is such a stereotype!There won't be any elephants?

00:32.380 --> 00:33.642
Of course there'll be elephants.

00:33.685 --> 00:36.384
It's a stereotype
that you feed them peanuts.

00:36.427 --> 00:38.734
Are you really gonna plan
a wedding in three months?

00:38.777 --> 00:41.128
Yeah, well, her family's
doing most of the work.

00:41.171 --> 00:43.521
They're amazing.
We talk all the time.

00:43.565 --> 00:44.566
Why?

00:44.609 --> 00:46.437
Because we're
about to get married

00:46.481 --> 00:48.483
and they're gonna be my family.

00:48.526 --> 00:51.834
Amy and I are married, and
I never talk to her family.

00:51.877 --> 00:53.444
Really? My parents
love Leonard.

00:53.488 --> 00:55.446
Yeah. And my mom loves
Penny, which is weird,

00:55.490 --> 00:58.188
because I never
knew she could love.

00:59.363 --> 01:01.539
And my dad has grown
to really...

01:01.583 --> 01:03.454
like Howard.

01:04.673 --> 01:08.024
Yeah, there's a nice...
coolness between us.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.200
Hey, guys,
before Anu gets here,

01:10.244 --> 01:12.811
can I talk about
the seating situation?

01:12.855 --> 01:14.509
I really don't want her
to sit on the floor.

01:14.552 --> 01:17.207
Oh. No problem.
Bernadette, floor.

01:17.251 --> 01:19.296
Hey!
Yeah, you can't
make my wife

01:19.340 --> 01:20.863
sit on the floor.Fine.

01:20.906 --> 01:22.908
Howard, floor.

01:22.952 --> 01:24.693
Fine, I'll sit on the floor.

01:24.736 --> 01:25.955
Thank you, Penny.
And, Leonard,

01:25.998 --> 01:27.870
I was kind of hoping
I could sit next to Anu.

01:27.913 --> 01:29.959
So now Ihave to
sit on the floor?
It's my house.

01:30.002 --> 01:31.352
Why can't Sheldon
sit on the floor?

01:31.395 --> 01:34.050
That might be
the dumbest thing
you've ever said.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.791
WOLOWITZ:
Guys, guys,

01:35.834 --> 01:37.575
there's a simple solution.

01:37.619 --> 01:40.752
I am not breaking up with her.

01:42.189 --> 01:45.366
All right. Let's
keep thinking.

01:45.409 --> 01:47.498
Hey, everybody, it's Anu.

Me, too.

02:33.414 --> 02:35.242
Yeah, it's just,
we haven't done it yet,

02:35.285 --> 02:36.634
and I think it's important

02:36.678 --> 02:38.419
to make sure we're compatible
before we get married.

02:38.462 --> 02:39.811
I totally agree.

02:39.855 --> 02:41.422
Oh, just one question.

02:41.465 --> 02:43.424
While we're doing it,
can I leave my shirt on?

02:43.467 --> 02:46.862
You know, the dumplings,
pretty salty.

02:46.905 --> 02:48.951
It doesn't have
to be tonight.

02:48.994 --> 02:50.561
How about this weekend?

02:50.605 --> 02:52.302
I can get us a room
at my hotel.

02:52.346 --> 02:53.521
Okay. Sounds nice.

02:53.564 --> 02:55.479
We can order
a bunch of room service,

02:55.523 --> 02:58.743
because I'm not eating anything
between now and then.

02:58.787 --> 03:00.745
Aw. Are you worried?

03:00.789 --> 03:01.964
I am not worried.

03:02.007 --> 03:04.706
If anything, I'm overconfident.

03:08.275 --> 03:10.015
I'm sure it's
gonna be fine.

03:10.059 --> 03:11.974
Oh, it's gonna be
better than fine.

03:12.017 --> 03:13.932
Trust me,
I've had no complaints.

03:13.976 --> 03:14.977
Good to know.

03:15.020 --> 03:17.545
Well, I've had
questions, comments,

03:17.588 --> 03:18.937
some constructive criticism,

03:18.981 --> 03:21.201
[snorts]:
but... no complaints.

03:23.899 --> 03:25.901
You're up early.

03:25.944 --> 03:28.251
Huh? Yes. I wanted
to get a jump

03:28.295 --> 03:30.427
on planning
a day of fun for you.

03:30.471 --> 03:31.646
Oh, that's sweet.
What are we doing?

03:31.689 --> 03:33.778
Oh, no. Just you.
I have other plans.

03:35.476 --> 03:38.914
Now, would you prefer
to see The Grinchin 2-D or 3-D?

03:38.957 --> 03:41.438
I don't want to see it at all.

03:41.482 --> 03:44.746
Well, let's go 2-D. No sense
in spending extra money.

03:44.789 --> 03:46.661
What are you
gonna be doing?

03:46.704 --> 03:48.445
Being a great husband.

03:48.489 --> 03:50.795
Yeah, you're gonna need
to show your work on that.

03:52.057 --> 03:54.234
After last night,
I got to thinking

03:54.277 --> 03:57.193
that I should have a better
relationship with your family.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.326
I think the one you have
with them is perfect.

03:59.369 --> 04:00.718
I hardly have one at all.

04:00.762 --> 04:02.851
Which is perfect.

04:02.894 --> 04:05.027
Oh, Amy, they're
important to you,

04:05.070 --> 04:06.855
and you're
important to me.

04:06.898 --> 04:08.683
Therefore, according to
the transitive property,

04:08.726 --> 04:10.772
they're important to me.
It's the same reason

04:10.815 --> 04:12.426
I'm interested
in your big, flat feet.

04:14.689 --> 04:17.039
Well, you know
that my mom can be...

04:17.082 --> 04:19.694
well, difficult
to get along with.Which is why

04:19.737 --> 04:22.566
I'm starting with your dad
and working my way up.

04:22.610 --> 04:24.351
All right.
I'm just worried

04:24.394 --> 04:26.788
you might have
a rather unpleasant day.

04:26.831 --> 04:28.355
Yeah, back at ya.
I watched the trailer

04:28.398 --> 04:29.660
for The Grinch--
it looks terrible.

04:31.749 --> 04:33.795

04:33.838 --> 04:36.145
Hi, Sheldon.
Oh, good.
You're right on time.

04:36.188 --> 04:38.365
Hi, Daddy.Hey, pumpkin.

04:38.408 --> 04:41.803
Pumpkin? I've been
calling her spaghetti squash.

04:41.846 --> 04:43.283
It's amazing
that one woman

04:43.326 --> 04:45.633
can be different vegetables
to different men.

04:45.676 --> 04:47.374
Bye.

04:47.417 --> 04:48.679
Bye.

04:48.723 --> 04:50.681
So, how does this work
with in-laws?

04:50.725 --> 04:52.683
Am I supposed
to be calling you Dad?

04:52.727 --> 04:54.206
Because I don't want to.

04:54.250 --> 04:56.600
You don't have to.Oh, thanks, Larry.

04:56.644 --> 04:58.602
Ooh. That doesn't
sound right.

04:58.646 --> 05:01.301
[gasps] Maybe I should pick
a vegetable for you.

the game for a second?

Uh, hang on.
I'm about to beat Howard.

05:10.832 --> 05:11.963
What? Hey!

05:12.007 --> 05:13.704
What?

He's our friend.

What's up, pal?

05:18.840 --> 05:21.233
I... I don't know
how else to say this,

05:21.277 --> 05:24.933
but, um, Anu and I are going
to have sex tonight.

05:24.976 --> 05:27.501
Yeah...

05:28.545 --> 05:30.808
Do you know how creepy
that sounds?

05:30.852 --> 05:33.289
Yeah...

05:35.770 --> 05:37.772
So, is this the first time?

05:37.815 --> 05:38.860
Yeah.

05:38.903 --> 05:40.818
How you feeling
about it?
Uh...

05:40.862 --> 05:42.516
to be honest,
I'm pretty anxious.

05:42.559 --> 05:45.867
I mean, this is the woman I'm
marrying-- what if it's no good?

05:45.910 --> 05:47.434
Do we break up?
Do we...

05:47.477 --> 05:50.393
sign on for a lifetime
of mediocre sex?

05:50.437 --> 05:52.482
Just don't put
so much pressure on it.

05:52.526 --> 05:54.571
It's always a little awkward
in the beginning.

05:54.615 --> 05:56.747
I remember the first time
I slept with Penny.

05:56.791 --> 05:57.792
It was bad?

05:57.835 --> 06:00.272
Oh, it was awesome!

06:02.884 --> 06:06.017
I will replay it in my head
until the day I die.

Well, if it helps,
I was really nervous

06:08.106 --> 06:09.760
my first time with Bernie.

06:09.804 --> 06:14.635
Mostly because I was worried
my mom would walk in.

06:14.678 --> 06:15.375
Did she?

06:15.418 --> 06:17.855
Yea-- Yeah.

one thing.

gonna be fine.

she's gonna know

there's no sexual position

bad at sex, too.

redundant?

07:08.993 --> 07:11.126
Aren't weapons,
by their very nature, lethal?

Yes. Thank you, thank you.

important thing is to have fun.

09:46.803 --> 09:49.153
With a bottle of champagne?

09:49.197 --> 09:51.591
Mm, I like to celebrate
the little things in life.

09:52.722 --> 09:55.507
You need to go?
There's still some left.

09:56.987 --> 09:59.903
Raj, what is going on?No, no, it's not
what's going on,

09:59.947 --> 10:01.905
it's what's comin' off.

10:01.949 --> 10:03.298
Stop it.

10:03.341 --> 10:06.388
You're acting weird,
and it's freaking me out.

10:06.431 --> 10:08.869
Why? Because I couldn't talk
and ran in the bathroom

10:08.912 --> 10:10.653
to slug back a
bottle of champagne

10:10.697 --> 10:13.047
when I pretended to pee?

10:13.090 --> 10:15.440
Okay, I think I'm gonna leave.

10:15.484 --> 10:17.704
No, no, wait, wait,
don't-- okay, don't go.

10:17.747 --> 10:20.054
Fine. Then tell me
what's going on.

10:21.098 --> 10:23.231
Well, funny story...

10:23.274 --> 10:27.104
The truth.Oh, God, the truth is
so not good for me!

10:30.281 --> 10:32.283
Voilà.

10:32.327 --> 10:33.676
Darn it.

10:33.720 --> 10:34.721
It's okay.

10:34.764 --> 10:36.461
Here, let me
show you again.

10:40.552 --> 10:43.599
It's like you're
actually magic.

10:44.905 --> 10:48.648
You can do that but you still
can't get my bra off.

10:50.258 --> 10:53.522
The rings don't roll
their eyes at me.

10:53.565 --> 10:57.091
Excuse me, Turnip,
we need to get going.

10:57.134 --> 11:00.660
But-but Howard was gonna show me
some close-up magic.

11:00.703 --> 11:02.226
Well, if you want
to see real magic,

11:02.270 --> 11:03.706
I'll take you
to Union Station,

11:03.750 --> 11:05.839
home to trains, subways
and busses that,

11:05.882 --> 11:09.277
every half hour-- voilà--
drive to the airport.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.714
I'd like to stay,
if you don't mind.

11:11.758 --> 11:12.933
Oh, not at all.

11:12.976 --> 11:15.762
Howard. A word.

11:17.459 --> 11:18.852
What's up?

11:18.895 --> 11:21.985
I need you to stop
being so delightful.
What?

11:22.029 --> 11:23.421
I'm supposed to be
bonding with him.

11:23.465 --> 11:25.685
You have your own father-in-law;
leave mine alone.

11:25.728 --> 11:27.687
Tell you what, you take my
father-in-law, I'll take yours.

11:27.730 --> 11:28.775
I don't want
your father-in-law.

11:28.818 --> 11:32.561
What if I throw in
a quarter?

11:32.604 --> 11:34.781
Do it again.
Do it again.

11:36.130 --> 11:39.699
Mrs. Fowler.
Mrs. Fowler.

11:39.742 --> 11:41.701
Mrs. Fowler.

11:42.919 --> 11:44.747
Sheldon, what's going on?

11:44.791 --> 11:45.966
Where is Larry?

11:46.009 --> 11:48.664
Oh, Turnip's out;
I'm bonding with you.

11:53.277 --> 11:56.541
Okay, you wanted the truth,
here it is.

11:56.585 --> 11:57.760
You have a drinking problem.

11:59.283 --> 12:01.590
No. I, uh,
I have a talking problem,

12:01.633 --> 12:04.419
and a drinking solution.

12:04.462 --> 12:05.812
What does that mean?

12:05.855 --> 12:08.553
[sighs]

12:08.597 --> 12:11.818
Oh, Anu, for
most of my life,

12:11.861 --> 12:13.907
I got so nervous
around women

12:13.950 --> 12:16.126
that I couldn't talk
to them without alcohol.

12:16.170 --> 12:19.086
So you've been drunk every time
we've seen each other?

12:19.129 --> 12:20.957
No. No. It hasn't
happened in a long time.

12:21.001 --> 12:22.785
And I really thought
I was over it,

12:22.829 --> 12:25.788
but I guess...
I-I don't know,

12:25.832 --> 12:28.312
I guess I-I wanted so much
for tonight to go well,

12:28.356 --> 12:30.619
that I-I stressed
myself out.

12:30.662 --> 12:32.012
It came back.

12:32.055 --> 12:33.883
[sighs]

12:33.927 --> 12:36.016
Why didn't you tell me
about this before?

12:36.059 --> 12:38.758
I was embarrassed.

12:38.801 --> 12:40.760
I get that.

12:43.066 --> 12:44.589
If it makes you
feel any better,

12:44.633 --> 12:47.636
I've got things
I'm embarrassed about, too.

12:47.679 --> 12:49.899
Really? Will you
tell me one?

12:49.943 --> 12:52.859
Okay. Um...

12:52.902 --> 12:55.775
Ugh. I hate
telling people this.

12:55.818 --> 12:59.648
I don't like music.

12:59.691 --> 13:02.216
What kind of music?

13:02.259 --> 13:04.827
Just all of it.

13:06.046 --> 13:08.657
It sort of seems
like a waste of time.

13:08.700 --> 13:12.835
Even Beyoncé?

13:12.879 --> 13:14.663
See, this is why
I don't tell people.

13:14.706 --> 13:16.230
No. Um, it's fine.
It's just,

13:16.273 --> 13:20.147
have you heard
"Single Ladies"?

13:20.190 --> 13:21.931
Yeah, and I don't get it.

13:21.975 --> 13:24.238
I mean, the lyrics are
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh."

13:24.281 --> 13:27.937
Y-You have to sing it in
the voice of a goddess.

13:27.981 --> 13:29.809
Like: ♪ Oh, wa-ah, oh

13:29.852 --> 13:31.375
♪ Wa-ah, oh

13:31.419 --> 13:32.768
♪ Oh, oh, oh

13:32.812 --> 13:35.118
♪ Wa-ah, oh.
[laughs]

13:35.162 --> 13:38.861
My point is, we both have
our little eccentricities.

13:38.905 --> 13:40.776
Little eccentricities?

13:40.820 --> 13:43.866
One is a deep-seated
psychological disturbance,

13:43.910 --> 13:46.129
and the other can be solved by
half a glass of chardonnay.

13:49.741 --> 13:53.789
So the doctor prescribed Nizoral
and it blocked enzyme action,

13:53.833 --> 13:57.140
and the fungus
cleared right up.

13:57.184 --> 14:00.970
That's a very
disturbing picture.

14:01.014 --> 14:03.407
Yes, well, they say a picture's
worth a thousand words,

14:03.451 --> 14:06.236
but I say nothing beats a
picture and a thousand words.

14:06.280 --> 14:10.850
Still, you might want
to take it off Facebook.

14:10.893 --> 14:13.069
Oh, no. It's in my nature
to share.

14:13.113 --> 14:15.985
So, your turn.

14:16.029 --> 14:17.900
Uh, other than Amy,

14:17.944 --> 14:21.817
have you every had anything
removed from your body?

14:24.602 --> 14:27.736
I am not going to answer that.

14:27.779 --> 14:30.565
Smart. Save something for
our next get-together.

14:30.608 --> 14:33.437
Oh, we should commemorate
this one with a selfie.

14:36.745 --> 14:41.010
Oh, look at us,
two peas in a pod.

14:41.054 --> 14:42.751
Oh, speaking of vegetables,

14:42.794 --> 14:46.059
how about I start calling you
Old Lady Green Beans?

14:50.802 --> 14:52.892
Hey, you look
deep in thought.

14:52.935 --> 14:55.546
Ah, I'm just reflecting.About what?

14:55.590 --> 14:57.940
The first time
we slept together.

14:57.984 --> 15:00.725
Oh, honey. Don't beat
yourself up; it's great now.

15:02.989 --> 15:05.687
This is not good.

15:05.730 --> 15:06.993
Sheldon is hanging out
with my mom.

15:07.036 --> 15:08.342
Yeah. O-One sec.

15:08.385 --> 15:10.953
W-What do you mean,
"don't beat myself up"?

15:10.997 --> 15:13.086
AMY:
Guys, focus.

15:13.129 --> 15:15.131
My mom thinks
that Sheldon is the reason

15:15.175 --> 15:16.524
I don't spend a lot of time
with her.

15:16.567 --> 15:17.960
Well, why would
she think that?

15:18.004 --> 15:19.005
Because I told her.

15:19.048 --> 15:21.659
You need a cup of coffee?
Wake up!

15:21.703 --> 15:24.010
So you've been using Sheldon
as an excuse

15:24.053 --> 15:25.837
to get out of
seeing your mother?

15:25.881 --> 15:27.535
[sighs] I know.

15:27.578 --> 15:29.015
I feel terrible.

15:29.058 --> 15:31.669
I love my mom but,
you know, sometimes...

15:31.713 --> 15:34.672
Yeah. We-We've met her. Yeah.

15:34.716 --> 15:37.284
And it's easier to say
I can't spend time with her

15:37.327 --> 15:41.418
because of Sheldon than to admit
that I just, I don't want to.

15:41.462 --> 15:43.116
Totally understandable.

15:43.159 --> 15:44.813
I'll ask again,
what do you mean,

15:44.856 --> 15:46.815
"don't beat myself up"?

15:48.034 --> 15:50.993
And then you ask me 20
questions to try to determine

15:51.037 --> 15:53.300
which Nobel Prize-winning
physicist I am.

15:53.343 --> 15:54.866
Ready? Go.

15:58.609 --> 16:01.003
Can I give up?

16:01.047 --> 16:03.919
No. 19 questions left.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.965
[ringtone playing]

16:10.708 --> 16:11.971
Are you gonna get that?

16:12.014 --> 16:14.060
Oh, no. We're in the
middle of a game.

16:16.105 --> 16:18.978
18 questions left.

16:20.544 --> 16:22.285
Answer the phone,
Sheldon.

16:23.199 --> 16:25.071
Hello, Amy.

16:25.114 --> 16:26.898
Hey, how's it going?

16:26.942 --> 16:30.163
Well, Howard lured your dad away
with magic,

16:30.206 --> 16:31.991
so now I'm bonding
with your mom.

16:35.081 --> 16:36.996
I think she likes me.

16:39.302 --> 16:40.912
I'd like you a lot better

16:40.956 --> 16:43.176
if you weren't keeping
my daughter away from me.

16:43.219 --> 16:44.655
Uh, wh-- Hang on, Amy.

16:44.699 --> 16:47.528
What's the problem,
Green Beans?

16:47.571 --> 16:50.966
Amy said she couldn't come
to Thanksgiving dinner

16:51.010 --> 16:53.012
because you always have
to spend it with your mother.

16:53.055 --> 16:55.623
I haven't spent Thanksgiving
with my mother in years.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.365
Amy, why would you tell
your mother

16:58.408 --> 16:59.975
that I spend Thanksgiving
with my mother?

17:00.019 --> 17:03.022
Uh, no time
to talk about that now.

17:03.065 --> 17:04.936
All your action figures
are on fire.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.460
Harrison Ford's in the lobby.
Come quick.

17:10.072 --> 17:11.421
And Amy never joins us
for Sunday dinners

17:11.465 --> 17:13.641
because you refuse to go out
on a school night.

17:13.684 --> 17:16.165
Sh-- I can go out
on a school night

17:16.209 --> 17:18.515
as long as I'm in
my PJs by 10:00.

17:19.647 --> 17:21.083
Sheldon, don't listen to her.

17:21.127 --> 17:22.215
She doesn't know
what she's talking about.

17:22.258 --> 17:25.218
She's crazy!

17:25.261 --> 17:27.046
Hello, Amy.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.397
Hello, Mother.

17:33.139 --> 17:37.099
Great news. We-we can come
for Thanksgiving this year.

17:38.579 --> 17:40.581
I can't believe it.

17:40.624 --> 17:42.278
All this time
I've been angry at you

17:42.322 --> 17:43.888
when I should have
been angry at Amy.

17:43.932 --> 17:46.326
Look at that.
We're both angry at Amy.

17:46.369 --> 17:49.024
Maybe that's something
we could bond over.

17:50.156 --> 17:51.418
Let me ask you this:

17:51.461 --> 17:53.507
how do you feel about Howard?

17:53.550 --> 17:57.119
Oh, is he that odd little friend
you have with the haircut?

17:57.163 --> 18:00.601
I may have married
the wrong Fowler.

18:03.169 --> 18:06.737
Why would Amy feel
the need to lie to me?

18:06.781 --> 18:07.999
Well, perhaps because
you're her mother

18:08.043 --> 18:09.653
and she didn't want
to disappoint you.

18:09.697 --> 18:11.612
Really?

18:11.655 --> 18:13.701
Even after she threw you
under the bus,

18:13.744 --> 18:15.311
you're still
gonna defend her.

18:15.355 --> 18:16.965
Oh, yes.

18:17.008 --> 18:18.488
She's my wife
and I love her.

18:18.532 --> 18:20.795
And if I can forgive her for
putting ketchup on her eggs,

18:20.838 --> 18:23.145
I can forgive her for this.

18:23.189 --> 18:26.888
Her father does that,
it's disgusting.

18:26.931 --> 18:30.021
Amy's crazy,
you are a delight.

18:38.465 --> 18:40.206
Good morning.

18:40.249 --> 18:42.121
Mm. Good morning.

18:42.164 --> 18:43.339
I ordered some coffee for us.

18:43.383 --> 18:46.168
Oh, fantastic.

18:46.212 --> 18:47.996
[sighs]

18:48.039 --> 18:49.650
Last night was...

18:49.693 --> 18:51.391
wonderful.

18:53.044 --> 18:55.090
[sighs] But all we
did was talk.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.571
Yeah. And it was wonderful.

18:57.614 --> 18:59.921
Am I safe to assume
you talking to me now

18:59.964 --> 19:01.966
is a good sign
for our marriage?

19:02.010 --> 19:04.230
[chuckles] Yeah,
and-and for my liver.

19:06.188 --> 19:07.624
Hey, about the other thing.

19:07.668 --> 19:09.496
Um...

19:09.539 --> 19:11.933
Should we just wait
for another night?

19:13.239 --> 19:16.459
Or I go take a shower,

19:16.503 --> 19:18.896
and you decide how
you want to play this.

19:24.772 --> 19:27.166
Take a shower with me, Raj.

19:35.826 --> 19:37.176
Thank you, Amy.

19:37.219 --> 19:38.655
It's so nice of you
to have us over for dinner.

19:38.699 --> 19:42.616
[chuckles] Couldn't think
of a single reason not to.

19:42.659 --> 19:45.053
Yeah, and boy,
did she try.

19:45.096 --> 19:47.011
Thank you, honey.

19:47.055 --> 19:48.187
Oh, you're welcome, dear.

19:49.797 --> 19:52.103
Would anyone like to see the
magic trick Howard taught me?

19:52.147 --> 19:54.845
I'd love to see your trick,
Daddy.

19:58.197 --> 20:01.243
A perfectly ordinary
table knife.

20:01.287 --> 20:02.940
[exhales]

20:05.291 --> 20:07.467
Watch closely.

20:07.510 --> 20:09.730
Voilà.

20:09.773 --> 20:13.124
Oh, my gosh,
that was so good.

20:18.782 --> 20:21.481
Well, look,
there's fake blood, too.

20:23.352 --> 20:25.049
I'll be right back.

20:29.489 --> 20:32.056
I don't know about you,
but I don't really like magic.

20:32.100 --> 20:36.322
You just keep getting
better and better.
