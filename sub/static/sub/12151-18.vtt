00:01.929 --> 00:03.469
Previously on Angel:

00:04.929 --> 00:08.369
I've fought vamps and demons,
but never had a Fred before.

00:09.130 --> 00:12.539
He's not taking the baby
overnight. He's taking it for good.

00:12.730 --> 00:14.619
- Justine?
- I just need to do this.

00:18.129 --> 00:20.410
- Wes thought Angel--
- Was going to kill Connor.

00:21.129 --> 00:24.640
He had a reason for taking Connor.
We have to tell Angel.

00:25.329 --> 00:27.859
- He'll forgive Wesley?
- Maybe begin to forgive.

00:29.530 --> 00:32.719
You son of a bitch!
You think I forgive you?! Never!

00:33.130 --> 00:34.880
You're a dead man! You're dead!

00:38.530 --> 00:39.859
It's hopeless.

00:40.329 --> 00:43.100
Half these files, I can't read
the clients' names.

00:43.329 --> 00:46.210
Friz, Frizzana, Frizzlecar?
What does this say?

00:46.929 --> 00:49.320
I think it's Frzylcka.

00:50.530 --> 00:53.479
They were that couple that called
with the squatter in their lair.

00:54.130 --> 00:55.990
Wesley was supposed to--

00:58.329 --> 00:59.939
He was supposed to
see to that.

01:00.130 --> 01:02.869
- He was too busy stealing the baby.
- Don't.

01:03.729 --> 01:05.060
Okay?

01:06.129 --> 01:08.870
How's it coming?
Any headway on those files?

01:09.730 --> 01:13.209
- Some, sort of.
- There's so much to keep track of.

01:13.930 --> 01:16.489
Still, times like these,
it's good to keep busy.

01:17.530 --> 01:19.810
Throw yourself into work.
Stay active.

01:19.930 --> 01:22.180
He lost the only
child he'll ever have.

01:22.930 --> 01:26.019
Oh, sugar, I know. I know.

01:26.530 --> 01:29.409
- I wish he'd talk to us.
- Leave him alone.

01:30.129 --> 01:32.870
The rage has passed,
but you really want to know?

01:33.730 --> 01:36.120
I'm sure he's not planning to...

01:36.129 --> 01:38.019
...finish what he started.

01:38.530 --> 01:40.989
Wesley's too smart
to show his face.

01:43.329 --> 01:46.909
We're back!
And we're bearing gifts.

01:50.530 --> 01:52.040
What happened?

01:54.000 --> 02:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:19.930 --> 02:22.000
I'm so sorry.

02:40.330 --> 02:41.800
No more bets.

02:42.129 --> 02:43.919
No more bets.
The wheel's in motion.

02:46.930 --> 02:48.610
Place a bet, place a bet.

02:54.729 --> 02:58.629
Table six. The one in blue.
Palmed a king in his left hand.

03:00.129 --> 03:01.639
And, Benny...

03:01.930 --> 03:05.620
...just take the left hand. We can
make money off the right.

03:07.330 --> 03:08.340
You.

03:11.530 --> 03:12.719
Good.

03:13.930 --> 03:15.960
Bring him in.
His marker's up.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.560
Time to collect his soul.

04:37.050 --> 04:39.079
I'm just here, okay?

04:50.850 --> 04:53.519
- This house is thick with sadness.
- Tell me about it.

04:54.449 --> 04:56.339
Home is where the heart is,
but these hearts are broken.

04:56.850 --> 04:59.660
I wish to aid my princess
in her time of need.

04:59.850 --> 05:02.620
I brought clothing and food
for her shiv-roth.

05:03.449 --> 05:07.000
The vigil of the bereaved.
I almost forgot that word.

05:07.649 --> 05:10.629
We can't help their pain.
Is that why you're leaving?

05:11.250 --> 05:13.110
Me? No, no, these are....

05:13.649 --> 05:16.279
- They're not mine.
- They are Wesley's, then?

05:16.649 --> 05:19.529
You might want to avoid
saying the name.

05:20.250 --> 05:22.879
- Wesley. That was it.
- Don't be ridiculous, Monica.

05:23.850 --> 05:26.410
- It was Sherman.
- You don't know any Shermans.

05:26.850 --> 05:29.800
- It was Wesley. Irish fellow?
- English, you old bat.

05:30.449 --> 05:32.769
That's who we were talking to.
Is he here?

05:33.449 --> 05:36.079
- He's on sabbatical.
- Sorry for the mix-up.

05:36.449 --> 05:39.120
It says you have a squatter
in your lair?

05:40.050 --> 05:42.959
- Damn Skench demons. They're all alike.
- Here we go.

05:43.050 --> 05:45.790
- Person spends his half-life--
- Building a lair.

05:46.649 --> 05:49.040
And what happens?
A Skench demon squats.

05:49.649 --> 05:53.160
On your coffee table. Ask me how
often I've listened to this.

05:53.850 --> 05:57.009
- Like you ever listen.
- You have so much to say.

05:57.449 --> 06:00.680
Skenches. I've heard about them.
Impish kind of demon?

06:01.649 --> 06:04.110
- Like a leprechaun?
- Leprechauns don't exist.

06:04.649 --> 06:07.810
- Now, Syd, don't embarrass the lad.
- Oh, sorry, kid.

06:08.250 --> 06:10.670
Skenches take over a house,
drive out the people?

06:11.250 --> 06:12.620
You can't stay.

06:13.050 --> 06:15.860
The shrieking all night
and the projectile phlegm.

06:16.649 --> 06:19.600
The only thing worse is putting up
with her for 300 years.

06:20.250 --> 06:23.339
- You've been married three centuries?
- Ever since the mitosis.

06:23.850 --> 06:26.689
Not that I'd mind being
a single-celled organism.

06:27.449 --> 06:28.430
Oh, shut up, Syd.

06:28.649 --> 06:31.629
I thought getting rid of them was
easy. Don't you lop off its head?

06:32.250 --> 06:35.579
- If you can avoid the phlegm.
- Syd has a phlegm phobia.

06:36.449 --> 06:39.149
I do not.
I have a phobia about sputum.

06:39.449 --> 06:41.060
I think we got everything.

06:41.850 --> 06:43.920
I'll clean out your
Skench problem.

06:44.250 --> 06:46.569
We'll call you
as soon as it's done.

06:47.250 --> 06:49.279
- Call me anytime.
- For crying out loud.

06:49.649 --> 06:52.490
She's a 16th of your age.
Put your eyes back in your head.

06:53.250 --> 06:55.209
An amoeba can dream, can't he?

06:55.649 --> 06:57.439
Man, you hear those two?

06:58.050 --> 06:59.490
It's beautiful.

06:59.850 --> 07:02.019
All that time,
and they're still in love.

07:02.250 --> 07:05.439
The way they finish each
other's insults, it's....

07:06.449 --> 07:07.500
Beautiful.

07:10.050 --> 07:12.329
- Is there evil to vanquish?
- Thanks, bro. I got it.

07:12.449 --> 07:15.009
Just a demon under
Alvarado and Clark.

07:16.050 --> 07:17.699
- Bye.
- Don't forget your machete.

07:17.850 --> 07:19.079
Yes, dear.

07:19.649 --> 07:22.949
He's fortunate to have such
a woman looking after his weapon.

07:24.449 --> 07:26.269
I'm not touching that one.

07:26.850 --> 07:30.110
Probably best to keep
this stuff out of sight...

07:30.449 --> 07:31.920
...just in case....

07:34.649 --> 07:37.980
I gotta run. I have a reading
in Topanga Canyon.

07:38.850 --> 07:40.810
It's a good time for house calls...

07:41.250 --> 07:43.040
...considering the vibe here.

07:44.250 --> 07:47.759
- Hey, if he needs anything, just....
- I'll call.

08:14.329 --> 08:15.730
Hi, Wesley.

08:17.329 --> 08:18.839
How are you feeling?

08:24.529 --> 08:26.490
It's not permanent, though.

08:28.730 --> 08:31.189
I brought you some stuff
from the office.

08:31.730 --> 08:33.590
Things there are....

08:34.129 --> 08:36.409
Well, things.

08:40.730 --> 08:43.919
Gunn and I found your notes
about the baby.

08:44.330 --> 08:45.309
The prophecy.

08:46.730 --> 08:49.259
You thought Angel was gonna kill him.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.500
You were trying to protect him.

08:52.730 --> 08:54.409
Both of them.

08:55.730 --> 08:58.080
I wanted you to know
I understand that.

09:00.529 --> 09:02.139
And I also wanted to say...

09:02.330 --> 09:05.169
... what Angel tried to do to you
was wrong...

09:05.929 --> 09:07.509
...and I'm sorry.

09:10.730 --> 09:12.659
But he was right to blame you.

09:14.330 --> 09:16.049
You should have come to us.

09:16.730 --> 09:19.500
You should've trusted us
instead of Holtz.

09:19.730 --> 09:22.330
You were our friend,
and you didn't even--

09:25.129 --> 09:28.039
If Angel sees you again,
he'll kill you.

09:28.730 --> 09:30.659
This time for real.

09:33.529 --> 09:35.559
Don't come back to the hotel.

09:37.129 --> 09:38.460
Ever.

09:43.730 --> 09:45.200
The prophecy was false.

09:46.730 --> 09:49.120
Angel was never going to hurt Connor.

09:50.330 --> 09:52.049
It was all for nothing.

10:05.049 --> 10:07.149
Hail to you, potential client.

10:09.250 --> 10:11.279
How may I be of service?

10:11.649 --> 10:15.720
- This Angel Investigations?
- It is. You in need of some help?

10:17.049 --> 10:18.450
So...

10:18.850 --> 10:20.779
...you must be Angel.

10:35.649 --> 10:37.090
Gotta be it.

10:48.250 --> 10:49.330
Smells like old people in...

10:51.250 --> 10:52.970
...here! Gross!

10:57.250 --> 10:59.279
Okay, definitely not a leprechaun.

11:25.450 --> 11:26.679
Must be my lucky day.

11:27.250 --> 11:28.299
Wanna bet?

12:40.049 --> 12:41.769
- What do you want?
- I wanna talk to him.

12:42.450 --> 12:45.190
- You got an appointment?
- No, I got business.

12:48.450 --> 12:50.700
Over here, slick.
A little touch-and-go.

12:50.850 --> 12:52.039
- You packing?
- No.

12:52.649 --> 12:55.110
He could kill you 10 ways
from Sunday.

12:55.649 --> 12:58.250
- But then he'd cook me too. Clean.
- Told you.

12:58.649 --> 13:01.600
- Not everyone's as honest as you, bro.
- I ain't your bro.

13:02.250 --> 13:04.389
You got a name or just a 'tude?

13:05.250 --> 13:06.929
Name's Gunn.

13:08.250 --> 13:11.159
Charles Gunn, if I'm not mistaken.
Man of the streets...

13:11.850 --> 13:14.480
...protector of the young.
What can I do for you?

13:14.850 --> 13:16.360
I want something.

13:17.250 --> 13:19.990
I don't traffic in wants.
I supply needs.

13:20.850 --> 13:22.850
Things you gotta have now,
or you'll die.

13:23.250 --> 13:25.879
- They tend to be more valuable.
- I need it.

13:26.850 --> 13:29.269
Then maybe I can assist.
What is it?

13:30.450 --> 13:31.679
Money? Power?

13:32.850 --> 13:33.759
Love?

13:49.649 --> 13:51.019
Very nice.

13:53.250 --> 13:56.059
She's a real beauty.
I can make it happen...

13:56.850 --> 13:59.129
...but there's a cost.
I guess you know that.

13:59.850 --> 14:02.659
Nothing to pay now,
but one day you will. The cost...

14:04.049 --> 14:05.559
...is your future.

14:05.850 --> 14:07.149
What future?

14:08.250 --> 14:09.230
Well...

14:09.450 --> 14:10.500
...there's that.

14:10.649 --> 14:14.269
I need you to state for the record
of your own freewill.

14:15.450 --> 14:18.190
You're sure you wish
to mortgage your future...

14:19.049 --> 14:21.080
...for your present happiness?

14:21.450 --> 14:22.850
I'm sure.

14:26.250 --> 14:27.620
Shake on that?

14:33.450 --> 14:34.320
Good.

14:40.649 --> 14:44.409
You made a deal. Signed a blood oath
trading your soul.

14:44.850 --> 14:48.080
- You think you can get out of it?
- Who said I'm trying to?

14:49.049 --> 14:51.820
- You're giving away your soul.
- What are you saying?

14:52.049 --> 14:54.539
Some broad.
You're falling for her hard.

14:55.049 --> 14:57.789
- Fred.
- We don't get a name, just an image.

14:58.649 --> 15:01.600
We watch the Akashic records.
Wouldn't we know...

15:02.250 --> 15:04.990
...when one of our souls
was transferred?

15:05.850 --> 15:07.740
Isn't Fred a guy's name?

15:08.250 --> 15:11.509
None of mine. I'm here to say
you broke the contract.

15:12.450 --> 15:15.539
Your soul ain't yours to give.
It's Mr. Jenoff's to take.

15:16.049 --> 15:18.370
- I gotta see him.
- What you gotta do is pay up.

15:19.049 --> 15:21.860
- I'm not the same person I was then.
- We get older...

15:22.049 --> 15:23.799
...and we pay our debts to him.

15:24.450 --> 15:26.519
There must be something
else he can take.

15:26.850 --> 15:29.759
I have never heard that before.
Now, listen good.

15:30.450 --> 15:33.500
You have got 24 hours
to get your house in order...

15:34.049 --> 15:36.820
...and get down to that casino.
If you're thinking about...

15:37.649 --> 15:40.070
...running or cheating, don't.

15:40.649 --> 15:43.210
Because we'll take your soul
and the girl's.

15:43.649 --> 15:46.669
- She's got nothing to do with this.
- Keep it that way...

15:47.250 --> 15:49.210
...or you can get her killed.

15:50.850 --> 15:52.779
It's up to you now, slick.

15:53.850 --> 15:55.289
See you tomorrow.

16:18.250 --> 16:19.789
You okay?

16:21.850 --> 16:24.480
- What?
- I said, are you okay?

16:24.850 --> 16:26.570
Yeah, I'm fine.

16:27.250 --> 16:29.500
Seemed rude to chow down
in front of Angel...

16:30.250 --> 16:31.899
...so I took a little break.

16:32.049 --> 16:34.299
- You are not okay, pal.
- I'm just tired, but--

16:35.049 --> 16:38.000
Cordelia here. I can see the misery
on your face.

16:41.649 --> 16:44.600
- I know what's going on.
- You do?

16:45.250 --> 16:47.039
It's pretty obvious.

16:47.649 --> 16:50.389
Angel's lost his son,
Wesley's gone, and you are...

16:50.649 --> 16:52.750
...happy as a kid in a candy store.

16:53.649 --> 16:55.750
Um, happy?

16:56.049 --> 16:59.600
And racked with guilt because
of it. Well, don't be.

17:00.250 --> 17:03.370
You and Fred are meant to be.
I get that now.

17:03.850 --> 17:06.618
She's a doll.
I was a little slow on the uptake.

17:07.450 --> 17:09.700
I thought she and Wes, but....

17:11.049 --> 17:14.309
The way you look at each other.
This place could use...

17:14.650 --> 17:17.809
...a little happiness right now.
You and Fred have your...

17:18.848 --> 17:20.920
...big, bright futures ahead of you.

17:21.250 --> 17:24.940
I'm here to tell you it's all
right to enjoy it. Life goes on.

17:26.049 --> 17:27.910
I should enjoy my future.

17:28.450 --> 17:31.750
I'm just saying. One thing
I learned on Hell Mouth:

17:32.650 --> 17:36.480
Every day is precious. You never
know when it may be your last.

17:38.650 --> 17:40.819
I never figured I'd be around
this long...

17:41.650 --> 17:42.910
...or have this much.

17:42.849 --> 17:45.589
Some people never know
one day of joy. You're lucky.

17:46.450 --> 17:48.170
Maybe I am.

17:48.849 --> 17:50.500
So live a little.

17:50.650 --> 17:53.839
We don't have any pressing cases,
and I haven't had a vision in, like--

17:55.450 --> 17:56.460
Oh, wait.

17:57.849 --> 18:01.539
I'm having one right now.
It's of you and Fred.

18:02.650 --> 18:04.160
Taking tomorrow off.

18:05.049 --> 18:08.069
And see, my visions.
Never wrong.

18:08.650 --> 18:10.299
Have some fun.

18:31.450 --> 18:33.170
All right, ready?

18:33.849 --> 18:35.150
Red T-shirt...

18:35.650 --> 18:39.369
...your dark-blue blue jeans,
gray boots.

18:39.849 --> 18:42.759
Oh. Was I right about any of it?

18:43.450 --> 18:45.730
Okay, that was just a warm-up.

18:48.250 --> 18:50.000
Yellow long-sleeve tee...

18:50.650 --> 18:53.390
...gray cords, tan boots.

18:55.450 --> 18:56.319
See?

18:56.650 --> 19:00.269
Record secure. Never takes me
more than twice.

19:02.049 --> 19:03.380
Me?

19:04.450 --> 19:06.799
Maybe you should come
over here and find out.

19:06.849 --> 19:08.670
Of course, if it takes you
too long....

19:10.450 --> 19:12.450
- It won't.
- Hey!

19:14.049 --> 19:16.859
Sorry, I have to cancel.
Somebody just walked in.

19:17.049 --> 19:18.869
- He better looking than me?
- Way.

19:19.450 --> 19:21.549
And he brought me
breakfast in bed.

19:22.450 --> 19:25.539
- Voila, madame. Room service.
- Cool.

19:26.049 --> 19:27.869
- You didn't cook, did you?
- Nope.

19:29.650 --> 19:31.539
Food from your favorite diner.

19:32.049 --> 19:36.299
Pancakes and waffles?
I'm in starch heaven. Yum.

19:39.849 --> 19:42.900
- Is today special or something?
- Yep, very special.

19:44.049 --> 19:46.220
- How come?
- Because we have the day off.

19:46.450 --> 19:48.450
- We do?
- We'll spend every minute...

19:48.849 --> 19:51.380
...having the best day of our lives.

19:52.450 --> 19:54.769
- Well, now it's official.
- What?

19:55.450 --> 19:58.400
You are the best boyfriend ever.

19:59.650 --> 20:01.579
Pancake kiss!

20:06.690 --> 20:08.369
How we feeling today?

20:09.690 --> 20:11.650
It's been rough,
but I have good news.

20:12.089 --> 20:14.579
There's no sign of infection
or rebleeding...

20:15.089 --> 20:17.410
...and the swelling's down.
We can stop worrying...

20:18.089 --> 20:20.049
...about your airway
becoming compromised.

20:20.490 --> 20:22.630
I'm gonna release you today.

20:23.490 --> 20:25.519
Is there someone that can pick you up?

20:27.089 --> 20:29.299
Friend or a family member
we can call?

20:46.289 --> 20:48.539
I think he was gonna be left-handed.

20:51.089 --> 20:53.160
The way he'd hold on to your fingers...

20:55.289 --> 20:57.500
...his left hand always squeezed...

20:57.690 --> 20:59.720
...just a little bit tighter.

21:03.089 --> 21:04.630
Kid had a grip.

21:06.089 --> 21:08.759
He was gonna be a southpaw for sure.

21:13.289 --> 21:15.220
When you live as long as I do...

21:16.289 --> 21:18.250
...you eventually lose everyone.

21:19.890 --> 21:23.259
You don't get used to it,
but you expect it. You deal.

21:25.289 --> 21:27.039
But he was just....

21:32.490 --> 21:33.819
He was just a little....

21:40.289 --> 21:43.940
You think you know about living
because you have this long life.

21:45.690 --> 21:49.170
That's really all you have.
I mean, in my case, anyway.

21:51.690 --> 21:53.720
Then one day you wake up...

21:55.890 --> 21:57.400
...and you have something else.

21:59.490 --> 22:00.819
The future.

22:10.890 --> 22:12.400
I had a son.

22:21.930 --> 22:26.109
And now for our next item
of pleasure, we got movies galore.

22:27.329 --> 22:30.420
You pick. You wanna hit the 12-plex?
See every preview?

22:30.930 --> 22:33.559
Like seeing a year's
worth of movies at once.

22:35.730 --> 22:38.920
Your shake okay?
It's your favorite. Double mocha.

22:39.930 --> 22:43.410
- I'm kind of full.
- Oh, my God. This is serious.

22:44.130 --> 22:47.250
It's Sixth Street tacos,
fish sticks at the pier....

22:47.730 --> 22:50.009
Don't fold on me.
We got more fun to go today.

22:50.730 --> 22:53.539
I'm all for fun.
It's just, I might explode.

22:54.329 --> 22:55.700
Right. Sorry.

22:56.130 --> 23:00.200
No more food. But movie, club,
shopping, fun still to be had.

23:00.930 --> 23:04.369
- You wanna go to the roller rink?
- I'm kind of wiped.

23:06.930 --> 23:09.279
We've been having so much fun today.

23:09.930 --> 23:11.890
Don't you think
we should save some...

23:12.329 --> 23:16.579
...before all the other people get
sad because we took all the happy?

23:17.730 --> 23:19.829
I blew it. I tried too hard.

23:20.130 --> 23:23.640
No, it's been like the most wonderful,
beautiful day ever.

23:24.329 --> 23:26.220
Aside from the knot in my tummy.

23:26.730 --> 23:29.009
Being with you is always special.

23:30.329 --> 23:34.829
We don't have to cram the rest of
our lives into one single day, right?

23:39.329 --> 23:40.769
Oh, my God.

23:42.930 --> 23:45.599
You did try too hard.
You haven't been yourself.

23:46.529 --> 23:48.599
You did this because
something's wrong.

23:48.930 --> 23:50.859
- No.
- Something is terribly wrong.

23:51.329 --> 23:54.240
Charles, do you have leukemia?

23:57.930 --> 24:00.420
I see it on the news.
They're young, in love...

24:00.930 --> 24:03.599
...their whole lives ahead
when tragedy strikes.

24:04.529 --> 24:06.279
- I'm not sick.
- You're not?

24:06.930 --> 24:08.930
- You promise?
- I'm not sick.

24:10.529 --> 24:11.609
Thank God.

24:12.329 --> 24:14.119
I feel much better.

24:14.730 --> 24:17.259
Except for the terrible knot inside.

24:21.930 --> 24:24.029
Which isn't the food at all.

24:26.730 --> 24:27.920
It's us.

24:32.130 --> 24:33.740
What's wrong with us?

24:34.529 --> 24:36.490
- It's nothing.
- Oh, that helps.

24:38.730 --> 24:41.150
- Maybe we should go.
- We should stay here...

24:41.730 --> 24:44.150
...and you should stop lying to me.

24:45.930 --> 24:49.650
I know something's wrong.
Just be honest and tell me.

24:51.329 --> 24:52.200
Charles.

24:54.329 --> 24:55.380
Charles.

24:57.930 --> 25:00.099
Whatever it is,
we'll get through it.

25:05.730 --> 25:07.200
No, we won't.

25:08.730 --> 25:09.710
What?

25:09.930 --> 25:11.049
This isn't something
we're gonna talk through.

25:11.130 --> 25:13.160
We share our feelings, then hug.

25:15.329 --> 25:18.170
- I don't like how you're speaking.
- Too bad.

25:20.730 --> 25:23.849
- Why are you being mean?
- I'm being honest. You want that?

25:26.730 --> 25:27.710
Yeah.

25:28.529 --> 25:30.069
Be honest.

25:32.730 --> 25:33.960
Is it me?

25:35.130 --> 25:37.410
Wow, you finally figured
that one out.

25:38.730 --> 25:41.430
- What's wrong with me?
- Now I gotta make a list?

25:41.730 --> 25:45.170
- I don't think I have enough time.
- Are you joking?

25:46.529 --> 25:50.500
- What's happening?
- You and me are over. Done.

25:51.329 --> 25:53.720
- No.
- Am I asking? I'm telling. Enough.

25:54.329 --> 25:56.329
- I don't believe it.
- Better start.

25:57.329 --> 25:58.490
But wait. Wait.

26:00.329 --> 26:02.359
Is there someone else?

26:05.730 --> 26:07.099
What's her name?

26:08.730 --> 26:12.589
Her name is "I'm a real woman, not a
stick figure." Get the picture?

26:14.730 --> 26:16.549
- Yeah.
- Good.

26:33.849 --> 26:37.500
I won't sit here and pretend I know
what you're going through...

26:38.049 --> 26:41.029
...or that I could begin
to understand your feelings.

26:42.849 --> 26:45.940
The last thing you need right now
is someone saying...

26:46.450 --> 26:51.509
...that given time, things will
get better, or the hurt will go away.

26:53.049 --> 26:54.769
Because it won't get better.

26:55.450 --> 26:57.660
The hurt's never going to go away.

27:00.849 --> 27:04.109
If you lived another 200 years,
you'd never forget...

27:05.049 --> 27:08.700
...how Connor was taken from you,
and you shouldn't.

27:11.650 --> 27:13.680
You loved your son, Angel...

27:15.250 --> 27:17.460
...and you'll go on loving him...

27:18.849 --> 27:20.529
...and missing him.

27:22.450 --> 27:24.480
You'll go on living too.

27:25.450 --> 27:26.779
You'll do that.

27:29.049 --> 27:30.589
I don't know how.

27:33.250 --> 27:34.690
You don't need to.

27:35.650 --> 27:39.230
The how works itself out.
Life will just keep happening.

27:39.849 --> 27:43.470
There'll be people who need us, and...

27:45.250 --> 27:46.299
...we'll help them.

27:48.250 --> 27:50.670
Because that's what we do.

28:04.450 --> 28:06.480
- Fred.
- I'm sorry.

28:06.849 --> 28:09.869
I was gonna knock, but it wasn't
a good time, so I didn't.

28:10.450 --> 28:13.430
- I don't know what else to do.
- What is it? What's wrong?

28:14.049 --> 28:17.279
It's Charles. I think
he's in terrible danger.

28:42.849 --> 28:44.569
I'm here to pay my bill.

28:46.009 --> 28:47.869
- Wow.
- I know, huh?

28:47.809 --> 28:51.220
- I am sorry this has come to pass.
- I'm confused.

28:52.009 --> 28:54.109
- What was unclear?
- Well, upstairs...

28:55.009 --> 28:57.920
- ...you said Gunn was in danger.
- He is.

28:58.009 --> 29:01.309
- And you think that because...?
- He broke up with me.

29:02.210 --> 29:04.140
But not really.

29:04.609 --> 29:05.799
- No?
- No!

29:06.410 --> 29:09.460
- That is good. I'm relieved.
- This is worse, much worse.

29:10.009 --> 29:12.539
- I wish he had broken up.
- Are you sure he didn't?

29:13.009 --> 29:16.589
- Those things he said to you--
- I know he said those things...

29:17.210 --> 29:20.720
- ...but he would never say them.
- Those things he said?

29:21.410 --> 29:24.109
Exactly! That's why I know
he's in trouble.

29:25.009 --> 29:27.609
Let me get this straight.
You and Gunn are dating?

29:28.009 --> 29:29.660
Not anymore, I guess!

29:30.410 --> 29:33.779
- Fred, honey.
- Don't you see? He hurt me.

29:34.009 --> 29:37.029
And the only reason he'd do that
is to protect me.

29:37.609 --> 29:41.579
Whatever it is, it's gotta be bad
because this hurts like hell.

29:42.410 --> 29:44.299
I guess we better help him.

29:46.009 --> 29:49.309
We are not losing another
member of this family.

30:13.009 --> 30:13.920
This is Gunn,

30:14.369 --> 30:15.240
leave a message,

30:15.569 --> 30:17.150
Still no answer at his place
or on his cell phone.

30:17.369 --> 30:18.240
Oh, no.

30:18.569 --> 30:20.319
- This does not bode well.
- We'll split up.

30:20.970 --> 30:23.220
To cover more ground.
It is a good plan.

30:23.970 --> 30:26.460
Fred and I will check out
his old gang haunts.

30:26.970 --> 30:28.549
- Or if they know any of his enemies.
- Exactly.

30:30.569 --> 30:33.240
- You two go by his place.
- Report his truck stolen.

30:33.569 --> 30:35.640
Not a bad idea.
Get the police involved.

30:36.569 --> 30:38.640
We should leave Lorne a note.

30:38.970 --> 30:41.069
If we come up with nothing,
we'll regroup.

30:41.369 --> 30:44.039
We could leave these small
rectangles behind...

30:44.970 --> 30:47.430
...like that creature who
inquired about Gunn.

30:47.970 --> 30:49.200
Right. Good.

30:49.769 --> 30:51.630
What? Let me see that.

30:53.369 --> 30:57.059
Rectangles with telephonic digits
so people can get in touch with us.

30:57.569 --> 31:00.450
- Somebody came by looking for Charles?
- Yesterday.

31:01.170 --> 31:03.730
Remind me to give that rectangle
to Gunn once we find him.

31:04.170 --> 31:05.849
I'm confident we shall.

31:06.569 --> 31:08.150
- Works for Jenoff.
- Jenoff?

31:08.369 --> 31:10.160
The Soul Sucker.

31:17.970 --> 31:19.269
Charles Gunn.

31:19.769 --> 31:20.960
I'm impressed.

31:21.569 --> 31:24.309
Not a lot of guys walk through
that door willingly.

31:24.569 --> 31:26.079
Not the second time, anyway.

31:26.970 --> 31:30.200
She must be special,
to give her my merchandise.

31:30.569 --> 31:32.920
I'm making good on my debt.
Don't talk about her.

31:33.569 --> 31:36.339
- Don't think about her.
- She's not part of the deal.

31:37.170 --> 31:38.710
- Hold him.
- I'm not gonna run.

31:38.970 --> 31:40.829
But touch me, and you better.

31:44.970 --> 31:46.859
Let's get this over with.

31:53.369 --> 31:54.529
Gunn!

32:10.170 --> 32:11.539
- Charles!
- Fred!

32:11.970 --> 32:13.049
Hey.

32:29.970 --> 32:31.509
- Angel.
- I know.

32:31.769 --> 32:33.000
- We are surrounded.
- I know.

32:33.569 --> 32:35.960
- We have to save Charles.
- I know.

32:38.970 --> 32:41.500
Who's a guy gotta kill
to talk to the boss?

32:42.569 --> 32:44.109
I'm the boss.

32:46.769 --> 32:50.910
- Why are you disrupting my business?
- You're disrupting mine.

32:52.170 --> 32:55.289
You're about to deprive me
of a valuable employee.

32:55.769 --> 32:57.869
Charles Gunn works for me.

32:58.769 --> 33:02.000
A good businessman looks into
the background of employees.

33:02.369 --> 33:06.440
Had you done that, you might've
learned he's short-term material.

33:07.769 --> 33:09.380
I'll make a deal with you.

33:11.369 --> 33:14.809
You release him, forget what
he owes you, I'll let you live.

33:17.369 --> 33:18.240
Thank you.

33:19.170 --> 33:20.400
Kill them.

33:22.170 --> 33:23.609
Double or nothing.

33:28.170 --> 33:30.240
You offering me your soul?

33:30.569 --> 33:33.519
- Chance to win it, anyway.
- How stupid do I look?

33:34.769 --> 33:37.019
You're a vampire.
I can smell it.

33:37.769 --> 33:41.069
Take a bigger whiff.
I'm a vampire with a soul.

33:43.769 --> 33:45.769
You're that vampire.

33:46.170 --> 33:49.190
I choose the game.
I win, we walk out of here.

33:50.369 --> 33:52.720
Gunn's debt disappears.
You win...

33:54.569 --> 33:55.799
...you get us both.

34:15.650 --> 34:18.179
Brilliant stall tactic.
Now, what's the plan?

34:18.650 --> 34:20.539
- This is the plan.
- Really?

34:21.050 --> 34:23.469
Really. We're gonna win
Gunn's soul back.

34:24.050 --> 34:26.219
This is so wrong in so many ways.

34:27.050 --> 34:30.949
It's not money or a bunny Angel's
playing for. It's my boyfriend.

34:31.849 --> 34:33.219
Don't be nervous.

34:33.650 --> 34:36.070
Been around a long time,
won a lot of bets.

34:37.250 --> 34:39.710
We're different.
I get lost and lose things.

34:40.849 --> 34:44.570
- And I can't lose Charles.
- I'm not gonna lose.

34:46.849 --> 34:48.429
You worried about this?

34:48.650 --> 34:51.110
Like taking candy from a baby.

34:52.250 --> 34:54.880
If we must rely on luck,
I prefer the odds of my sword.

34:55.250 --> 34:58.550
- We should fight our way out.
- Fighting puts us at risk.

34:59.449 --> 35:01.340
- My way is safer.
- If you win.

35:01.849 --> 35:05.780
If you lose, won't you go evil
and kill everybody, including us?

35:07.849 --> 35:10.409
- Am I wrong?
- Not wrong in theory.

35:10.849 --> 35:13.449
- But I've gotta go with ace.
- I'm gonna win.

35:15.050 --> 35:18.000
If I lose, you know what to do.

35:18.650 --> 35:21.110
- Make it quick.
- You know I will.

35:33.650 --> 35:36.949
Jenoff lets me have the bodies
when he's done.

35:54.650 --> 35:56.789
One hand of cards. You win...

35:58.849 --> 36:00.710
...this man walks free.

36:01.849 --> 36:05.289
I win, I keep his soul,
and I get yours.

36:06.050 --> 36:08.679
Name your game.
Omaha, Texas Hold 'Em...

36:09.650 --> 36:12.280
- ...Seven Card Stud.
- How about a cut of the deck?

36:12.650 --> 36:13.809
High card wins.

36:19.849 --> 36:22.829
Vampire's not only got soul,
he's got guts.

36:35.449 --> 36:37.800
- Feeling lucky?
- After you.

37:21.050 --> 37:22.309
- A three?
- A three?

37:22.849 --> 37:25.170
A three. You lose.

37:30.650 --> 37:32.719
- That quick enough?
- Works for me.

37:42.050 --> 37:43.489
Charles!

37:45.050 --> 37:47.119
- Angel?
- No need to say thanks.

37:48.050 --> 37:51.309
Right. If killing him was that easy,
I would've done it.

38:07.250 --> 38:08.719
Now we fight.

38:12.050 --> 38:13.869
Anybody else in here owe this guy?

38:21.650 --> 38:22.659
Let's go.

38:33.170 --> 38:36.429
Say it again,
a little slower this time.

38:37.369 --> 38:40.489
I was terribly, terribly
wrong to break up with you.

38:41.570 --> 38:44.199
- And say those mean and untrue things.
- Good.

38:45.170 --> 38:48.050
Now say it into the tape recorder.

38:52.369 --> 38:55.110
I'm really sorry,
and I'll never do it again.

39:01.969 --> 39:05.409
- I'm just glad you're all right.
- I'm all right if you and me are good.

39:06.170 --> 39:07.179
We are, aren't we?

39:12.769 --> 39:14.659
- Just one last thing.
- Name it.

39:16.969 --> 39:19.179
Who'd you trade your soul for?

39:21.170 --> 39:22.360
That....

39:22.369 --> 39:24.760
- That was a long time ago.
- I know. Tell me...

39:25.369 --> 39:27.690
...and we'll never talk about it again.

39:28.369 --> 39:30.050
Who was she?

39:31.969 --> 39:32.840
Charles....

39:33.170 --> 39:37.280
- That was before I met you.
- You must've wanted her pretty bad.

39:37.969 --> 39:39.650
Guess I did.

39:40.369 --> 39:41.739
Just tell me.

39:45.769 --> 39:47.070
It....

39:49.369 --> 39:51.230
It was a truck.

39:52.969 --> 39:56.760
I was 17 years old, and I sold
my soul for a truck.

39:58.369 --> 40:01.070
- Not this truck.
- Don't go dissing my girl.

40:01.369 --> 40:02.880
Your soul wasn't
worth air conditioning?

40:03.170 --> 40:06.539
This truck kept me alive. Helped me
save a lot of other lives too.

40:07.969 --> 40:09.690
I know it sounds dumb...

40:09.769 --> 40:12.019
...but I didn't think a soul
was that big a deal.

40:12.769 --> 40:14.869
Didn't think I had a future then.

40:15.769 --> 40:17.099
Now I do.

40:29.570 --> 40:32.309
What is it about you
that makes me melt?

40:33.769 --> 40:35.800
Maybe it's that I love you.

40:39.170 --> 40:40.920
That's gotta be it.

40:41.305 --> 40:47.371
