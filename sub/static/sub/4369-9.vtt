I feel really good about us

00:12.543 --> 00:14.545
picking out each other's
Halloween costumes this year.

00:14.545 --> 00:18.249
I feel like I lost a bet.

00:18.249 --> 00:20.251
I did a pretty good
Chainsaw Chelsea
though, right?

00:20.251 --> 00:23.624
It was like you were acting
like you wanted to slice
people with a chainsaw,

00:23.624 --> 00:26.427
but you didn't really
want to slice people
with a chainsaw.

00:26.427 --> 00:28.259
I don't want to slice
people with a chainsaw.

00:28.259 --> 00:31.302

coming through for me.

anywhere.

And poor Diesel went
through all the trouble

00:49.620 --> 00:51.452
to look like
a crazed muskrat.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.387
He's not wearing a costume.

we should be, New York's
Central Park Spooktacular.

01:14.375 --> 01:16.577
It has the scariest
haunted house in the country.

We have to hand out candy

took Bret and Chet
trick and treating.

Besides, we can't go
to the Spooktacular.
It's 3,000 miles away.

01:50.381 --> 01:52.543
I mean, sure, we'd go
if we could magically travel

01:52.543 --> 01:54.345
across the country
instantaneously.

01:54.345 --> 01:56.347
But we have the power
to time travel,

01:56.347 --> 01:57.688
not the power
to teleport.

you two created
when you jumped
to the '70s,

03:42.653 --> 03:44.655
I made some adjustments
to the laser

03:44.655 --> 03:47.698

teleport objects.

to test it on this rat

Saying something
a bunch of times

04:00.871 --> 04:04.775
But if you prefer,
we can experiment
on this kiwi.

04:10.721 --> 04:13.854
Yes! Yes! I did it!
I teleported the kiwi!

04:13.854 --> 04:15.756
Now, where did I
teleport the kiwi?

04:19.829 --> 04:22.693
Sweet shuds! I not only
teleported the kiwi,

04:22.693 --> 04:24.695
I transformed it
into a tomato.

was already in my pants.

04:33.944 --> 04:36.947
Hey, what's this kiwi
doing in my pants?

04:38.679 --> 04:42.553
I invented teleportation.
Next stop, Sweden.

04:42.553 --> 04:43.684

04:43.684 --> 04:45.716

You're not gonna
accept the Nobel Prize
in a hoodie, are you?

04:50.891 --> 04:53.994
Of course not. I'm going
to wear the tuxedo
I bought when I was six

04:53.994 --> 04:55.796

the Nobel Prize.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.868
You planned to win
the Nobel Prize
when you were six?

04:57.868 --> 05:00.901
No, I planned to win
the Nobel Prize
when I was 15.

05:00.901 --> 05:04.535
When I was six, I got
a screamin' deal on a tux.

to the Central Park

in New York, right?

05:10.881 --> 05:12.943

the first teleportation trip

06:15.105 --> 06:16.877

Don't forget, Barry,
they're also time travelers.

06:18.108 --> 06:20.981

took that from you, too.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.853

that'll cheer you up.

We get to hand out
Halloween candy
at Shelby and Cyd's.

06:26.687 --> 06:28.088
But this year, I'm gonna
make you love it.

06:28.088 --> 06:31.121
Impossible. Halloween is
all about spooky scares,

06:31.121 --> 06:33.694
and as a man of science,
I know that all that ghost

06:33.694 --> 06:35.696
and goblin nonsense
is not real.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.698
Hence, I cannot
be scared by it.

06:37.698 --> 06:40.100
So you're saying
if I can scare you,
you'll like Halloween?

06:40.100 --> 06:42.903
I didn't say that.
So you're saying
if I'm scary enough,

06:42.903 --> 06:44.705
Halloween will be
your most favorite holiday?

06:44.705 --> 06:46.036
I didn't say that.
So you're saying

06:46.036 --> 06:48.709
some mitochondrial proteins
are encoded with nuclear DNA.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.611
Well, I have said that.
Challenge accepted!

06:51.642 --> 06:52.913

06:52.913 --> 06:54.985
you'll be terrified into
loving Halloween or elves.

06:54.985 --> 06:58.088
Did you say, "Or elves"?
That's not the expression.

06:58.088 --> 07:00.921
Oh, really? Then what's
the expression for
when you're trying

07:00.921 --> 07:03.093
to decide between
one thing and elves?

07:10.961 --> 07:13.063

cheese tots "Paula."

Maybe he's a clever bear

07:35.856 --> 07:37.688
just lying in wait.

by a Cuddle Bunny, bearing
the magic carrot crest
of Hop-a-long Forest.

08:12.923 --> 08:14.024
I'm guessing.

08:15.065 --> 08:16.867

what you are
embarrassed about.

Hidden in this

this side of the room.

09:28.899 --> 09:30.270
Cyd and I will take
this side of the room.

09:31.972 --> 09:33.904
Guys, I've seen
a lot of horror movies,

09:33.904 --> 09:36.947
and it's never
a good idea to split up.

09:36.947 --> 09:39.149
Oh, right, we're
in the same room.
It's probably all right.

09:41.151 --> 09:43.213
Hey, guys. I think
there's a key in here.

09:44.915 --> 09:46.857
If something
 doesn't open easily,

09:46.857 --> 09:48.859
it's not designed
 to be opened.

09:48.859 --> 09:50.921

what's not designed
to be opened.

09:51.892 --> 09:54.064
(GRUNTING)

09:54.064 --> 09:56.266
It was this. This was
not designed to be opened.

10:01.231 --> 10:03.904
One for the ghost,
one for the witch,

10:03.904 --> 10:05.175
and two for the teenager,

10:05.175 --> 10:07.978
who claims he's a werewolf
on a moonless night.

10:07.978 --> 10:10.010
I can't tell if you are
a stickler for werewolf lore

10:10.010 --> 10:11.812
or you're just making
a mockery of Halloween.

10:11.812 --> 10:14.284
Either way, I applaud you.

10:14.284 --> 10:16.887
Well, we're out of candy.
I guess Halloween's over.

10:16.887 --> 10:19.890
Don't worry. I'll just
fly over to the pantry
and get some more.

10:25.195 --> 10:26.897
Renaldo, would you
cut that out?

10:26.897 --> 10:28.328
It wasn't funny
the first three times.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.200
That's why I have to do it
six more times.

10:30.200 --> 10:31.902
It's the comedy rule of nines.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.267
Ahhh! My legs!

10:38.909 --> 10:41.171
They ripped off!
My legs ripped off!

10:41.171 --> 10:43.143
At least I still
have this jet pack.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.145
It's the only reason
I haven't fallen over yet!

10:47.117 --> 10:49.219
Renaldo, I'm not gonna fall
for this lame attempt

10:49.219 --> 10:51.151
to scare me into
liking Halloween.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.282
Fine.

Oh, no, Barry.
I'm running out of fuel.

10:58.058 --> 11:02.332
I'm going down.
I'm going down!

11:02.332 --> 11:04.935
Barry, don't look.
It's too awful.

11:09.239 --> 11:10.941
Anybody find any keys?

11:10.941 --> 11:11.972
Anybody find any clues?

11:11.972 --> 11:13.303
I found this jar of pickles.

11:13.303 --> 11:15.175
Why would somebody
leave a jar of
pickles in here?

11:15.175 --> 11:17.978
Welcome to New York.

11:17.978 --> 11:20.080
You know, I could actually
go for a pickle right now.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.952
(GRUNTING)

11:23.083 --> 11:24.915
Or maybe I'll just
look for clues.

11:26.887 --> 11:30.120
Guys, all of those clocks
are set to 12:15.
Maybe it's a clue.

11:30.120 --> 11:32.322
Or maybe there's something
inside the clocks.

GRANSBY: No, it's a clue.

11:37.327 --> 11:39.970
12:15 was the clue!

11:42.032 --> 11:44.034
Hey, this clock
isn't set to 12:15

11:44.034 --> 11:46.907
I'll break it.

Cyd, we did it.
We're out of
the escape room.

12:33.123 --> 12:35.055
Well, let's buy a couple
more cheese-tots

12:35.055 --> 12:37.227
and choke 'em down before
we jump back home.

Hey Paula, pop me a double!

12:43.033 --> 12:46.366
Shelby, those cheese-tots
just went right through me.

That's what happens when you
buy food from a cart.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.372
No. They went through me.

12:52.372 --> 12:55.045
Maybe that's how we
got out of the house.

12:55.045 --> 12:57.277
What, you mean like we went
through the walls?

12:57.277 --> 12:59.279
Is that even possible?

Naldo said Barry's
teleportation laser
was experimental.

13:02.052 --> 13:03.383
Maybe the laser
did this to us?

13:03.383 --> 13:06.356
All right, it's gonna be okay.
We're time travelers.

13:06.356 --> 13:09.289
We could just jump back
to before we teleported
and not get zapped.

13:12.092 --> 13:14.364
Shelby, if we can't
touch each other,

13:14.364 --> 13:15.425
we can't time travel.

13:16.526 --> 13:18.028
Or hug!

13:28.378 --> 13:30.040
Well, we are out of candy,

13:30.040 --> 13:33.043
but I did find batteries,
toilet paper,

13:33.043 --> 13:34.514
and little boxes of soaps.

13:34.514 --> 13:37.087
Kids don't like these things,
but they need them.

Barry! Help!

13:43.523 --> 13:47.057
A giant spider caught me!
I'm tangled in his web!

13:49.199 --> 13:52.432
Nice try, Renaldo,
but there are no spiders
big enough to capture a human,

13:52.432 --> 13:54.334
therefore I am not frightened.

13:54.334 --> 13:57.237
Seriously, Barry!
This isn't a joke!

13:57.237 --> 13:59.439
You have to get out of here!
The spider's coming!

14:05.215 --> 14:07.217
Now the spider's
eating Diesel's food.

14:07.217 --> 14:09.319
Ahhh! This is terrible!

14:09.319 --> 14:10.450
Still not scared.

14:12.482 --> 14:15.255
Now the spider needs to go do
his business in the yard!

14:16.486 --> 14:18.488
Aw, man,
Shelby's gonna kill me

14:18.488 --> 14:21.131
if that spider does
his business in the house.

14:24.464 --> 14:27.267
Lucas, I'm serious,
where did Shelby
and Cyd go?

14:27.267 --> 14:29.169
They couldn't have left.
The door's still locked.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.443
It's a haunted house.
Maybe they're a part of it.

14:33.443 --> 14:37.177
Or maybe they're ghosts.

I do not find that funny.

I am never making
a ghost joke again.

14:48.288 --> 14:51.161
Cyd, never stop telling
that joke. It is awesome.

14:53.263 --> 14:55.495
Okay, Riley and Lucas
can't see us,

14:55.495 --> 14:57.397
but if we can
communicate with them,

14:57.397 --> 14:59.129
they can get in touch
with Barry,

14:59.129 --> 15:00.300
and he can reverse this.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.232
Hey, I found the fourth key
in this book.

15:02.232 --> 15:04.304
Very impressive, Lucas.
How'd you know
it was in there?

15:04.304 --> 15:06.236
Well, it's the only one
not glued to the shelf.

15:06.236 --> 15:07.507
Plus it's called
 The Fourth Key.

15:07.507 --> 15:10.140
And all the other ones
are called Not This One.

15:11.181 --> 15:14.214
A little less impressive.

15:14.214 --> 15:17.317
Oh, no! They only
have to find one more key
and they're outta here.

15:17.317 --> 15:19.389
If they leave
the Spooktacular,

15:19.389 --> 15:21.391
we could lose them
in the city.

15:21.391 --> 15:23.493
And then we'll be stuck
as ghosts forever.

15:23.493 --> 15:25.395
And I'm in a Cuddle
Bunny costume.

15:25.395 --> 15:27.397
What am I supposed to do
when I haunt kids?

15:27.397 --> 15:31.361
Uh-durr!

15:31.361 --> 15:32.462
Still sounds like
you're mocking it.

15:32.462 --> 15:34.334
I am!
(CRASHING)

15:35.335 --> 15:37.267
Did that thing
fall over by itself?

15:37.267 --> 15:40.510
Cyd, you just knocked
that thing over.
How did you do that?

15:40.510 --> 15:42.512
I don't know.
I just got really mad

15:42.512 --> 15:44.344
and focused
on hitting something.

15:44.344 --> 15:47.317
Well, maybe that's it.
If we just really focus,

15:47.317 --> 15:48.648
we can move stuff.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.380
Maybe that's how we can
communicate with them.

15:52.522 --> 15:54.454
What was that?
It's working.

15:56.556 --> 16:01.591
It's Cyd and Shelby!

16:01.591 --> 16:05.435
Why do I smell cheese-tot
breath even though
neither of us had cheese tots?

16:10.570 --> 16:12.502
These effects are not bad.

16:14.304 --> 16:16.346
They still think
it's part of the
haunted house.

16:16.346 --> 16:18.508
We gotta do something.
We gotta do something big.

16:18.508 --> 16:20.280
I'm way ahead of you.

16:22.412 --> 16:24.354
That's your idea of going big?

16:24.354 --> 16:26.456
I don't know. I've never
been a ghost before.

16:27.517 --> 16:29.219
This is weird, right?

16:33.393 --> 16:36.496
A bouillon cube for you.
A bouillon cube for you.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.468
And a bouillon cube for you.

16:38.468 --> 16:41.471
Now all you need to do
is find a house that's
giving out boiling water,

16:41.471 --> 16:42.632
and you are set for soup.

16:45.305 --> 16:46.436
How's it going, Barry?

16:46.436 --> 16:48.338
Renaldo, let me
ask you a question.

16:48.338 --> 16:51.581
If I were to give you
a box of baking
soda in lieu of candy,

16:51.581 --> 16:53.243
how would you respond?

16:53.243 --> 16:54.344
I'd kick you in the shins.

16:54.344 --> 16:55.585
So, that is
the right response.

16:55.585 --> 16:57.347
I owe seven kids an apology.

16:59.219 --> 17:00.390
Where did you get
that bowl of candy?

17:00.390 --> 17:02.692
I saved this candy for us.
Want a piece?

17:02.692 --> 17:05.694
That depends. Are you going
to reach through the hole
in the bottom of the bowl

17:05.694 --> 17:07.727
and grab my hand
in an attempt to scare me?

17:07.727 --> 17:09.729
No.

17:14.564 --> 17:17.537
I guess you were right, Barry.
I'm never gonna scare you.

17:17.537 --> 17:21.310
Before I go, I suppose
I should leave a note.

17:22.442 --> 17:24.444
"Dear Mr. and Mrs. Marcus,

17:24.444 --> 17:27.347
"Your daughter Shelby
is in New York

17:27.347 --> 17:29.449
"Please keep
that in mind
when you realize

"I have given away
all of your stuff.

17:41.791 --> 17:45.335

abducted by aliens!

17:45.335 --> 17:47.597
There's no way you're being
abducted by aliens.

17:47.597 --> 17:50.700
See, Renaldo, this
is why I didn't want
to accept your challenge.

17:50.700 --> 17:53.743
I knew you would go
all out and it
would be for naught.

17:53.743 --> 17:55.605
If it makes you feel
any better, though,

17:55.605 --> 17:58.678
it's not on you.
I'm just impossible to scare.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.811

18:05.355 --> 18:06.516
Renaldo?

18:10.590 --> 18:12.392
Oh, my gosh.

18:12.392 --> 18:14.524
What a rush! I see it now!
You were right!

18:14.524 --> 18:16.726
You win! I love Halloween!

18:16.726 --> 18:19.469
Scare me again, Renaldo!
Scare me again!

18:19.469 --> 18:21.671
Hey, Barry, who're
you talking to?
(SCREAMS)

18:22.802 --> 18:24.634
And thank you.

18:24.634 --> 18:26.706
(SCREAMING)

18:28.838 --> 18:30.710
Thanks.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.742
Wait, if I'm not
in that chair,

18:33.683 --> 18:35.415
who is?

18:35.415 --> 18:37.587
(SCREAMING)

18:42.692 --> 18:45.425
Another key! It flew
out of the chair
while you were spinning it.

18:45.425 --> 18:49.429
I wasn't spinning it.
Just take the credit, Lucas.

18:49.429 --> 18:52.532
This is the final key.
GRANSBY:
 It's actually the second key.

18:52.532 --> 18:57.337
You found them out of order.
 But you know, it's cool.

18:58.668 --> 19:00.710
Oh, no. Why did I
spin that chair?

19:00.710 --> 19:02.412
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

19:02.412 --> 19:03.673
No! Stop!

19:05.875 --> 19:07.477
You can't just leave us here!

19:07.477 --> 19:09.479
We're time travelers,
not ghosts.

19:10.650 --> 19:14.454
I mean, regular teen girls.

19:15.885 --> 19:18.458
Riley, what are you
talking about?
Come on, let's go.

19:18.458 --> 19:19.789
I'm in control of Riley.

19:19.789 --> 19:22.592
You're right. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have pushed you.

19:22.592 --> 19:23.833
We'll go when
you're ready.

19:25.435 --> 19:27.697
Cyd, this might be the answer.

19:27.697 --> 19:29.639
We can't touch
to time travel

19:29.639 --> 19:31.571
because we don't have
human bodies.

19:31.571 --> 19:34.704
So all we have to do is
possess their bodies
like you just did.

19:34.704 --> 19:36.546
Great. Come on,
get into Lucas.

19:36.546 --> 19:38.878
I have to admit,
I'm really confused by that.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.752
Hey, I'm really sorry.

19:42.752 --> 19:44.814
I know we don't know
each other that well

19:44.814 --> 19:47.487
and I don't have your
permission and this is
really rude of me,

19:47.487 --> 19:49.619
but I kind of need to...
Lucas doesn't care.

19:49.619 --> 19:51.821
That's hurtful. I care
about a lot of things.

19:53.763 --> 19:55.525
Here goes.

19:58.528 --> 19:59.529
I'm in.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.532
It took you long enough,
Shelbs. Now let's go.

20:02.532 --> 20:03.703
Wait, while I'm a dude,

20:03.703 --> 20:05.475
there's one thing I gotta do.

20:08.508 --> 20:09.579
It just pops right off.

20:12.742 --> 20:14.744
Nice one, Shelbs.
Now, let's get out of here.

20:18.718 --> 20:19.919
Whoa, that was crazy.

20:19.919 --> 20:23.493
This is the coolest
haunted house ever.

20:23.493 --> 20:26.696
Time is up! You have failed
 to unlock the door!

20:26.696 --> 20:30.800
You will be trapped
 in my library forever!

20:30.800 --> 20:33.633
(EVIL LAUGHTER)

20:33.633 --> 20:36.506
Please exit to your left
 so the next group can enter.

20:38.638 --> 20:40.840
Did your body feel
really strange like
a minute ago?

20:40.840 --> 20:42.712
I think that's just
a part of growin' up.

20:46.916 --> 20:49.479
Next stop, Sweden.

20:49.479 --> 20:51.751
I'm going to teleport
myself to the Nobel Prize
offices in Stockholm.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.484
And they'll award me
the Nobel on the spot.

20:54.484 --> 20:55.725
We're gonna destroy that
laser, right?

20:55.725 --> 20:57.757
Oh, yeah.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.760
Ah! My laser.
What are you doing?

21:00.760 --> 21:03.793
Guys, it's not dangerous.
It just puts kiwis
in your pants.

21:05.695 --> 21:07.667
Trust us.
We're from the future.

21:07.667 --> 21:08.898
It turned us into ghosts.

21:08.898 --> 21:10.600
Oh, please. If it turned
you into ghosts,

21:10.600 --> 21:12.572
I'd be able to reach
right through you.

21:12.572 --> 21:15.645
(GROANING)

21:15.645 --> 21:17.477
Hands off the carrots, bub.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.880
Now, I know why people
are afraid of ghosts.

21:26.556 --> 21:28.888
Guess what I found.
A crossover episode

21:28.888 --> 21:30.890
of The Cuddle Bunnies
 and Chainsaw Chelsea!

21:30.890 --> 21:35.665
Our two favorite things
coming together to make
something even better.

21:35.665 --> 21:39.729
Oh, my carrots, what happened
to you, Scott Scarecrow?

21:39.729 --> 21:41.701
Looks like you lost your head.

21:41.701 --> 21:43.733
CHAINSAW CHELSEA:
Guess who, Cuddle Bunny?

21:43.733 --> 21:45.835
Oh, Chainsaw Chelsea!

21:45.835 --> 21:47.637
Hop of the evening to you.

21:47.637 --> 21:49.579
Eat steel!

21:49.579 --> 21:50.840
(LAUGHING)

21:50.840 --> 21:52.742
(CUDDLE BUNNY SCREAMING)

21:52.742 --> 21:54.744
Look at that stuffing fly!

21:55.745 --> 21:57.717
Joke's on her.

21:57.717 --> 21:59.519
Cutting Cuddle Bunny
in half just makes
two Cuddle Bunnies.
