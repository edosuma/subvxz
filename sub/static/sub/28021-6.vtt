WEBVTT

00:00.100 --> 00:03.260
You deserve to do great things.
I can make that happen.

00:03.266 --> 00:06.247
When can you move to the Cabinet Office?

00:06.269 --> 00:07.165
What's in the Cabinet Office?
A Russian spy.

00:07.165 --> 00:08.060
A Russian spy.

00:08.060 --> 00:10.540
What's the hold-up?
You were right. It's Miss Garrick.

00:10.540 --> 00:15.220
If something happens to me,
something happens to you.

00:15.220 --> 00:17.900
The politician you were dancing
with... We're barely acquainted.

00:17.900 --> 00:19.020
Change that.

00:19.020 --> 00:21.020
The Americans want us to let 100,000

00:21.020 --> 00:23.460
Jews into what they
allege is their homeland.

00:23.460 --> 00:27.340
The Arabs, understandably,
would prefer we did no such thing.

00:27.340 --> 00:30.180
I think we'll have this
solved before lunch.

00:30.180 --> 00:34.020
That was funny. Go on.
Keep running the world. Keep laughing.

00:34.520 --> 00:36.040
What brings you here, friend?

00:36.040 --> 00:38.400
I'm looking for some answers, I guess.

00:38.400 --> 00:40.760
So, when you told me Peter was
off on a mission, that was a lie.

00:40.760 --> 00:43.640
I honestly don't know
what you're talking about.

00:43.640 --> 00:46.440
Just tell me you killed him.
I want you to say it! Why?!

00:51.280 --> 00:53.560
I'm so scared of tomorrow.

00:53.560 --> 00:54.400
It's over.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:18.520 --> 01:19.920
There has to be trust.

01:21.920 --> 01:24.200
The thing about trust
is you can't prove it.

01:25.240 --> 01:26.600
That's what makes it trust.

01:28.240 --> 01:31.720
And for most people,
it takes years to build.

01:31.720 --> 01:34.040
I mean, I've been married
to my wife for 25 years.

01:36.440 --> 01:39.360
I keep thinking about
what that secretary said.

01:39.360 --> 01:40.360
Miss Savitt.

01:42.320 --> 01:44.160
"Keep running the world.

01:44.160 --> 01:45.240
Keep laughing."

01:46.600 --> 01:48.880
We have to be honest amongst ourselves.

01:50.200 --> 01:52.520
The British contingent are coming

01:52.520 --> 01:55.880
under pressure from the
British powers that be,

01:55.880 --> 01:59.360
to share where we are up
to in our deliberations.

01:59.360 --> 02:01.640
The pressure is improper.

02:01.640 --> 02:03.320
Because their main concern is oil.

02:05.320 --> 02:08.680
We're getting the same pressure
to spill the beans on our end.

02:08.680 --> 02:12.200
But our guys are only
interested in boats.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.640
And I don't know how you responded,

02:14.640 --> 02:17.360
but we didn't tell the
ambassador a damn thing.

02:17.360 --> 02:19.920
We didn't say a word to the treasurer.

02:19.920 --> 02:22.320
As you said,

02:22.320 --> 02:24.640
you can't prove trust.

02:24.640 --> 02:27.320
But handshakes among gentlemen
used to mean a great deal.

02:35.160 --> 02:36.200
Do the right thing.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.080
I just wondered if she was there.

02:49.080 --> 02:50.760
She didn't come home last night.

02:50.760 --> 02:52.720
Are you two living in sin now?

02:52.720 --> 02:54.520
No, I just... Then how else would

02:54.520 --> 02:56.360
you know she didn't come home all night?

02:56.360 --> 02:58.760
Don't worry, I won't tell Pa.

02:58.760 --> 03:01.000
But she's not at your house? No.

03:02.720 --> 03:04.680
A word to the wise,

03:04.680 --> 03:07.360
if you don't put a ring on it,
the pretty ones stray.

03:09.640 --> 03:12.440
My sister's always been a bit
of a free spirit, I'm afraid.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.040
Thank you so much.

03:17.040 --> 03:18.760
Good morning. Goodbye.

03:43.120 --> 03:44.960
Sit down. Take a load off.

03:47.920 --> 03:48.960
Please.

03:51.400 --> 03:52.600
How you doing?

03:54.600 --> 03:56.960
I work with Thomas Rowe.

03:56.960 --> 04:00.680
Supposed to meet him last night
at 11 o'clock. He never showed up.

04:00.680 --> 04:02.160
You got something there, boy?

04:05.800 --> 04:08.080
Do either of you know where Rowe got to?

04:10.880 --> 04:13.440
I was meant to be
meeting him last night too,

04:13.440 --> 04:15.240
but, like you said, he never showed.

04:18.200 --> 04:21.800
Anyway, I figured I'll come here,
talk to his trusted driver,

04:21.800 --> 04:24.680
see if he can help me figure
out the good man's whereabouts.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.560
Your fender's fucked up, man.
Did you hit something?

04:28.560 --> 04:29.600
I hit a dog.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.720
I'm never going to hit your face,

04:36.720 --> 04:39.000
because what you and me
got going on is private.

04:40.960 --> 04:43.760
You killed a white guy. No.

04:43.760 --> 04:45.800
I know your army number.

04:45.800 --> 04:49.560
G-I 1-0-3-4-7-2-6.

04:49.560 --> 04:51.400
Want me to get you arrested?

04:51.400 --> 04:54.280
Want to be shipped back to Alabama?

04:54.280 --> 04:55.960
What's going to happen when folks

04:55.960 --> 04:59.400
out there hear that you
killed a white guy? He didn't.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.200
Yeah.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.920
American juries,
they always believe the negro.

05:05.400 --> 05:06.720
It's a fact.

05:06.720 --> 05:09.600
Juries always find for
the negro, don't they, kid?

05:09.600 --> 05:14.240
And they've got nothing but respect
for the white girl he's fucking.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.400
The white girl with the fag brother.

05:19.240 --> 05:22.080
Yeah, Rowe told me everything.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.880
Bridgeman Creek Drive, Mobile, Alabama.

05:27.120 --> 05:30.000
Oh, I know where your momma lives.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.680
I know where your drunken mama lives

05:32.680 --> 05:34.960
and I know why that
fucking fender is bent.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.600
But let's not dwell in the past.

05:44.080 --> 05:45.080
Argh!

05:48.880 --> 05:50.360
You guys work for me now.

06:06.960 --> 06:08.640
Get ahold of the big five.

06:08.640 --> 06:10.120
Tell them Thomas Rowe is dead.

06:11.560 --> 06:13.880
What? Jimmy, brother!

06:13.880 --> 06:17.360
You want to work in the intelligence
business, people get killed.

06:17.360 --> 06:19.640
Relax. The Russians got him?

06:19.640 --> 06:22.080
The girl and the driver killed him.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.560
And that's good for us, because now

06:23.560 --> 06:26.360
they're ours forever and
we don't have to pay them.

06:26.360 --> 06:27.840
I gotta get the girl to work.

06:27.840 --> 06:30.160
What you tell the big five
is the great guy they met,

06:30.160 --> 06:32.480
the one who was posted in Berlin,

06:32.480 --> 06:35.600
he'll head this new intelligence agency.

06:35.600 --> 06:38.720
Which is actually great news,
because you always liked him more.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.080
Rowe was a fucking prick.

06:46.560 --> 06:47.560
We should run.

06:49.840 --> 06:50.840
Run to where?

06:52.560 --> 06:53.560
For how long?

06:56.880 --> 06:59.480
He knows the name of the
street my kid sister plays on.

07:10.880 --> 07:13.800
Rowe wanted you to turn
Miss Garrick, right?

07:13.800 --> 07:15.400
Uh, he was, he was going to help me.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.720
Well, he's gone and
now I'm going to help.

07:17.720 --> 07:20.280
Tell her you need to talk, tonight.

07:20.280 --> 07:21.840
Tell her she can pick the location,

07:21.840 --> 07:25.520
but it has to be somewhere in
public. Then tell me where.

07:25.520 --> 07:28.840
Rowe said that you had
a soft spot for her.

07:28.840 --> 07:32.720
You'd better hope she has one for
you too, because if she hasn't,

07:32.720 --> 07:34.600
her comrades will already be on to you.

07:39.240 --> 07:41.160
Smile, Miss Symonds.

07:41.160 --> 07:42.360
It might never happen.

07:52.120 --> 07:56.040
Before we begin, a quick
announcement for the ladies present.

07:56.040 --> 08:00.400
The Civil Service marriage
ban is to be discontinued.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.840
Uh, either one of you may marry me.

08:02.840 --> 08:08.320
Now, the latest projections
from health are more ambitious,

08:08.320 --> 08:11.120
not less, despite my
repeated fiscal concerns.

08:11.120 --> 08:13.080
Nevertheless, write them down.

08:14.840 --> 08:18.520
364,000 staff.

08:18.520 --> 08:22.880
These will include 2,000 radiographers,

08:22.880 --> 08:26.560
149,000 nurses and midwives,

08:26.560 --> 08:28.240
some of whom will be part time.

08:28.240 --> 08:32.159
128,000 ancillary staff
for cleaning, maintain...

08:33.760 --> 08:36.200
I'm sorry if I'm boring
you, Miss Symonds.

08:44.080 --> 08:45.080
How can I help you?

08:46.480 --> 08:47.600
I'm handing myself in.

09:03.600 --> 09:04.720
Did Feef come in today?

09:05.800 --> 09:07.360
Yes, she's in a budget meeting.

09:08.720 --> 09:11.000
She did come in this morning?

09:11.000 --> 09:13.680
And now she's in a budget meeting.

09:13.680 --> 09:17.120
Would you like me to pass
her some kind of love note?

09:17.120 --> 09:19.000
Hmm? A sonnet?

09:23.320 --> 09:24.680
They were blackmailing me.

09:24.680 --> 09:26.960
Thomas Rowe was? Where is he?

09:26.960 --> 09:28.840
I have no idea.

09:28.840 --> 09:31.120
He approached me with
pictures of my brother.

09:32.320 --> 09:33.720
He's a homosexual.

09:33.720 --> 09:35.280
So his sister committed treason.

09:35.280 --> 09:38.080
The newspapers would love this.

09:38.080 --> 09:41.200
They didn't come to me and say,
"Will you betray your country?"

09:41.200 --> 09:42.640
They came to me and said,

09:42.640 --> 09:45.360
"There is a Russian spy
in the Cabinet Office."

09:45.360 --> 09:48.520
I'm so sorry, what? And I think
it's alarming that you were entirely

09:48.520 --> 09:50.880
unaware that England
has been compromised.

09:50.880 --> 09:53.760
The Americans took me,
manipulated me, threatened me.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.760
The Russians have penetrated Whitehall.

09:55.760 --> 09:57.200
Why am I being interrogated?

10:00.160 --> 10:01.320
A Russian spy?

10:03.960 --> 10:05.200
I know who it is.

10:06.680 --> 10:09.200
And I won't tell you,
unless we make some kind of deal.

10:35.040 --> 10:36.680
Given that both the Russians

10:36.680 --> 10:39.480
and the bloody Americans
seem to be spying on us,

10:39.480 --> 10:41.400
I thought MI6 should know.

10:41.400 --> 10:44.400
In my opinion, there's a way we can

10:44.400 --> 10:46.760
deal with Russia and the
States at the same time.

10:49.320 --> 10:51.600
Let the Americans
finish what they started.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.680
Let us catch them in the act.

10:54.680 --> 10:56.960
By what method?

10:56.960 --> 10:57.760
Use the girl.

10:59.080 --> 11:03.480
She won't tell us who the mole
is unless we guarantee immunity.

11:03.480 --> 11:07.240
We can guarantee her immunity
and not mean a bloody word we say.

11:07.240 --> 11:09.520
Because, really, who gives a shit?

11:09.520 --> 11:11.760
She's a foreign bloody agent.

11:13.880 --> 11:16.280
What's going on?

11:16.280 --> 11:17.560
Who's he?

11:17.560 --> 11:19.240
Keep working for the Americans.

11:19.240 --> 11:22.480
Just do exactly what
they tell you to do.

11:22.480 --> 11:25.880
But does this mean I'm a double agent?

11:25.880 --> 11:27.200
I work for us?

11:28.760 --> 11:29.840
Yes, it does.

11:31.040 --> 11:32.040
Welcome home.

11:52.280 --> 11:53.520
Oh, come on.

11:54.960 --> 11:56.600
He's coming at eight.

11:56.600 --> 11:58.400
You haven't even taken your bath yet.

12:09.720 --> 12:11.520
Oh, gee.

12:43.480 --> 12:45.240
Oh.

12:46.760 --> 12:49.560
Well, they're not meant
to be here until eight.

12:49.560 --> 12:53.040

13:13.360 --> 13:14.720
Uh, wipe your feet.

13:24.040 --> 13:26.440
Something smells nice.

13:26.440 --> 13:28.840
Yes, my father and I just ate.

13:28.840 --> 13:30.720
Argh!

13:30.720 --> 13:32.120
Oh, shit!

13:38.720 --> 13:41.120
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
What's happened to you?

13:43.400 --> 13:44.800
Come on, Dad. Out you go.

13:47.280 --> 13:49.680
Come on. There you go,
everything's all right.

13:49.680 --> 13:51.960
Get the towel, come on.

13:56.360 --> 13:58.160
Oh, oh. Sorry.

13:59.680 --> 14:00.840
Throw me that towel!

14:00.840 --> 14:02.280
Ow! Yes.

14:02.280 --> 14:04.160
Oh, I hurt.

14:05.240 --> 14:06.520
Ow.

14:06.520 --> 14:08.000
All right.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.960
Oh, dear.

14:11.960 --> 14:13.520
Oh, ouchie.

14:16.680 --> 14:18.480
Well done.

14:20.440 --> 14:22.200
Dry you off.

14:22.200 --> 14:23.520
Arms in.

14:25.760 --> 14:26.640
What do you want?

14:29.000 --> 14:32.480
Well, what, is it? More trouble at work?

14:32.480 --> 14:33.840
Sit down.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.080
Oh,

14:35.080 --> 14:36.600
she is glorious.

14:38.560 --> 14:39.800
Here.

14:39.800 --> 14:41.720
You are beautiful ladies.

14:43.960 --> 14:45.600
Right, into bed, Dad.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.360
Two beautiful ladies!

14:48.400 --> 14:50.080
I think they're playing our song.

14:50.080 --> 14:52.400
Oh! I'm not quite sure that they are.

14:52.400 --> 14:55.600
Madame, you have nothing to fear.

14:55.600 --> 14:56.960
I'm all chivalry.

14:56.960 --> 14:58.560
Into bed, Dad. Now.

14:59.960 --> 15:01.280
Ah.

15:01.280 --> 15:03.120
Come on.

15:03.120 --> 15:04.600
Footsies up.

15:04.600 --> 15:05.680
There.

15:08.880 --> 15:11.760
Now, now you're safe.

15:11.760 --> 15:12.840
Goodnight.

15:16.960 --> 15:18.680
Door half open!

15:27.280 --> 15:28.360
After you.

15:50.200 --> 15:54.640
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you, ever.

15:54.640 --> 15:57.000
They wanted me to meet
you in a public space,

15:57.000 --> 15:58.960
so they could watch,
so they could protect me.

15:58.960 --> 16:01.280
But I came here to your house

16:01.280 --> 16:05.080
because I wanted to tell you
in private how much I like you.

16:05.080 --> 16:08.360
How you've made me see the
world so much more clearly.

16:08.360 --> 16:11.280
This does not have to end badly.

16:11.280 --> 16:14.000
It's not too late to change your mind.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.760
Wouldn't it be a relief to
be back on the right side?

16:17.760 --> 16:20.840
I mean, isn't it some
sort of primal wrong

16:20.840 --> 16:24.320
to serve a foreign power
and walk past their flags?

16:24.320 --> 16:25.800
I don't serve a foreign power.

16:27.280 --> 16:29.280
I serve an idea.

16:30.360 --> 16:33.360
See, I am not a gadabout
having an adventure.

16:35.040 --> 16:37.000
I'm trying to eradicate suffering.

16:38.720 --> 16:40.720
Suffering is not inevitable.

16:42.520 --> 16:44.480
Men make the world.

16:46.440 --> 16:50.840
My mother died at 29,
because it wasn't in the interest

16:50.840 --> 16:53.920
of capitalism to give her a doctor
for free. England's changing that.

16:53.920 --> 16:56.960
My father lost his
mind in the Great War,

16:56.960 --> 16:59.840
because Imperialists were
squabbling over resources

16:59.840 --> 17:02.480
instead of doing the first
thing we teach a toddler.

17:02.480 --> 17:03.480
To share.

17:05.240 --> 17:09.040
I think if one idea could
make the world a better place,

17:09.040 --> 17:11.040
the world would be a better place.

17:11.040 --> 17:14.280
You serve an idea and
you don't even know it.

17:14.280 --> 17:16.160
Capitalism.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.800
Organised selfishness.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.440
You don't serve an idea.

17:19.440 --> 17:22.440
You serve the propagators
of an idea, the Russians.

17:24.119 --> 17:25.480
If you weren't having doubts,

17:25.480 --> 17:27.839
why didn't you have me killed?

17:27.839 --> 17:28.920
Like Jarvis?

17:38.200 --> 17:39.200
I have to get that.

17:40.880 --> 17:42.320
It's the nurse for my father.

17:59.040 --> 18:02.960
She's here. What?

18:08.400 --> 18:10.040
Who do you work for?

18:10.040 --> 18:12.360
What is the name of your handler?

18:12.360 --> 18:13.360
What is it?

18:16.080 --> 18:18.640
Tell me! Who do you work for?

18:21.880 --> 18:23.280
Mind your own business!

18:25.760 --> 18:28.640
Your corpse will be found
in a bombed-out building.

18:28.640 --> 18:31.800
Your family will think
it's some random maniac.

18:31.800 --> 18:34.440
Whoever it is you're working for,

18:34.440 --> 18:37.840
they will know it is the Russians.

18:37.840 --> 18:39.640
Are you serious?

18:39.640 --> 18:41.000
You're going to let him do this?

18:41.000 --> 18:44.520
This is what your idea was,
you fucking hypocrite?

18:44.520 --> 18:46.800
Henry. Henry!

18:46.800 --> 18:48.160
Let go of me! Get off!

18:48.160 --> 18:50.400
Get off! Get off me!

18:55.880 --> 18:59.000
No, get off me!

19:06.120 --> 19:08.840
No, Henry, stop! Stop!
Stop! Get out of the room!

19:17.800 --> 19:19.760
Get off me!

19:19.760 --> 19:23.720
It's all right, Dad.
Everything's tickety-boo.

19:23.720 --> 19:26.080
Go on, it's fine. I'm fine. Get to bed.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.920

Argh!

22:08.760 --> 22:09.920
Do you have a phone?

22:31.400 --> 22:34.840
Got comrades waiting
for them in Mississippi.

22:34.840 --> 22:38.000
Your boat docks literally
40 blocks from Harlem.

22:38.000 --> 22:43.200
You go straight to
616 West 137th Street.

22:44.240 --> 22:46.040
I wrote the comrades there already.

22:47.760 --> 22:50.080
There's a bed waiting for you.

22:50.080 --> 22:52.560
What the fuck's going on?
And why are there two of you?

22:55.520 --> 22:57.360
This the white guy you told me about?

22:57.360 --> 23:00.560
Oh, that's sweet.
I like being talked about.

23:00.560 --> 23:02.480
Let's go. We got places to be.

23:02.480 --> 23:04.360
No.

23:04.360 --> 23:06.000
I'm all done driving.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.040
No, you're not all done shit.

23:08.040 --> 23:09.840
Get in the car, Jackson.

23:09.840 --> 23:11.360
We gotta go.

23:11.360 --> 23:13.000
That nigger killed a white man.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.800
You think I'm letting him go anywhere?

23:15.800 --> 23:18.080
This car is about to be
a murder weapon again.

23:20.520 --> 23:22.080
Niggas killing white people.

23:24.320 --> 23:26.280
Are you out of your fucking mind?

23:26.280 --> 23:28.680
Niggas killing white people?

23:28.680 --> 23:30.600
I've killed no-one.

23:30.600 --> 23:33.400
Not a single fucking person.

23:33.400 --> 23:35.360
The whole war they made me drive.

23:35.360 --> 23:36.640
Didn't even give me a gun.

23:38.160 --> 23:41.120
Yeah, I heard about a
whole lot of killing.

23:41.120 --> 23:43.400
Heard about white people killing.

23:43.400 --> 23:45.920
In France, Germany, Poland.

23:45.920 --> 23:48.960
White people killing white people.

23:48.960 --> 23:52.520
In the States, you hear about
white people killing black people.

23:52.520 --> 23:54.520
Hear about that every day.

23:54.520 --> 23:55.520
But niggas,

23:56.680 --> 23:57.760
killing white people?

23:59.480 --> 24:00.800
You make me fucking laugh.

24:13.960 --> 24:17.440
I don't want to spend another
second in this goddamn car.

24:17.440 --> 24:18.520
You driving.

24:24.680 --> 24:27.000
No matter where you walk,

24:27.000 --> 24:29.040
no matter where you go,

24:29.040 --> 24:30.840
you people will always be fucked!

24:42.400 --> 24:45.120
An American will arrive very shortly.

24:45.120 --> 24:46.480
You will not mention us.

24:47.640 --> 24:49.960
You will answer his questions.

24:49.960 --> 24:52.840
If you deviate from these
instructions, I guarantee you will

24:52.840 --> 24:55.960
imminently be hanged by
the neck until you are dead.

24:55.960 --> 24:57.880
So, all those dinner parties?

24:57.880 --> 25:00.280
Where was the Russian listening from?

25:00.280 --> 25:02.080
Where?

25:07.920 --> 25:09.080
Jesus.

25:18.160 --> 25:20.720
Confirm the Embassy's involvement.

25:20.720 --> 25:22.640
We need to know who he's working with.

25:24.400 --> 25:25.400
Miss Symonds?

25:27.840 --> 25:29.320
Don't click at me.

25:50.440 --> 25:52.040
Girl's a mess.

26:23.920 --> 26:25.040
How did you get in here?

26:27.680 --> 26:28.960
The door was open.

26:32.480 --> 26:33.720
Is Miss Symonds here?

26:35.800 --> 26:36.800
No.

26:42.960 --> 26:44.840
OK.

26:44.840 --> 26:47.120
This is the second night
she hasn't come home.

26:48.200 --> 26:50.000
Any idea where she might be sleeping?

27:02.960 --> 27:04.200
I'm going to need a saw.

27:06.280 --> 27:08.800
Uh, I can look for one.

27:08.800 --> 27:10.760
You've done enough.

27:10.760 --> 27:14.480
I gave you very specific
instructions and you fucked up.

27:14.480 --> 27:17.200
Dear, I'm going to ask you a lot of
questions over the next few days,

27:17.200 --> 27:19.480
and it all begins with this one.

27:19.480 --> 27:20.560
Do you have a saw?

27:26.840 --> 27:29.520
I think she'll talk to you
without you kicking her leg.

27:29.520 --> 27:32.320
Well, she did not answer
the first time I asked.

27:32.320 --> 27:34.640
Fine. Let's make that the rule.

27:34.640 --> 27:36.680
You tell me what I want to
hear the first time around,

27:36.680 --> 27:38.600
or else that leg of
yours gets kicked off.

27:38.600 --> 27:40.920
But Jimmy Derby said not to hurt her.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.280
What the fuck you talking about?

27:46.200 --> 27:47.440
Jimmy said no such thing.

27:48.640 --> 27:51.280
He said find out what she knows.

27:51.280 --> 27:52.560
Got him.

27:52.560 --> 27:55.400
You should know MI5, possibly MI6,

27:55.400 --> 27:57.680
are next door listening
to everything you say.

28:00.120 --> 28:01.200
She set you up.

28:03.760 --> 28:05.200
You fucking...

28:12.520 --> 28:13.520
Move.

28:25.400 --> 28:26.400
Back door.

28:59.720 --> 29:01.280
Everything's going to be fine.

29:03.720 --> 29:05.240
Absolutely fine.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.000
Last one.

30:04.040 --> 30:05.400
Now close your eyes.

30:06.920 --> 30:08.840
Now...

30:08.840 --> 30:09.840
..who are you?

30:20.240 --> 30:21.200
It's me.

30:23.200 --> 30:24.200
Pris.

31:38.120 --> 31:39.560
Easy enough to explain away.

31:40.900 --> 31:42.920
Beloved father had a heart attack.

31:42.920 --> 31:44.880
Spinster daughter committed suicide.

31:44.880 --> 31:45.880
The end.

31:41.980 --> 31:44.260
He's a Russian spy
with high level access.

31:46.500 --> 31:48.300
He's moving into the private sector.

31:50.580 --> 31:53.660
The Atomic Energy
Research Establishment.

31:58.350 --> 32:00.660
Quick word, Mr Stephens?

32:00.660 --> 32:01.660
Of course.

32:03.380 --> 32:05.220
Won't be a second. Duty calls.

32:15.800 --> 31:41.980
Why are they letting him retire early?

32:21.020 --> 32:23.700
These tapes confirm that America
has spied on British nationals,

32:23.700 --> 32:26.060
obviously without our
Government's consent,

32:26.060 --> 32:27.900
thus contravening the Atlantic Treaty,

32:27.900 --> 32:30.220
as well as the BRUSA agreement.

32:30.220 --> 32:33.180
Look, I don't see this
has to be a giant thing.

32:33.180 --> 32:37.100
Then the two of you will
leave England, within the week.

32:37.100 --> 32:39.340
And the story will be as follows...

32:40.340 --> 32:42.620
..the Russians never
penetrated Whitehall.

32:48.660 --> 32:50.620
And you guys never fail to catch them.

32:50.620 --> 32:53.660
Oh, so you guys are going to
take credit for busting this ring.

32:53.660 --> 32:56.060
You never recruited an English girl.

32:56.060 --> 32:59.700
She never killed an American citizen.

32:59.700 --> 33:01.740
Oh...

33:01.740 --> 33:03.220
..she didn't tell you that part?

33:14.100 --> 33:15.460
Now what?

33:17.180 --> 33:18.620
What's going to happen to me?

33:20.180 --> 33:22.540
There's only one option.

33:22.540 --> 33:26.100
There will be a clean slate
with some proper training.

33:26.100 --> 33:27.820
To all intents and purposes,

33:27.820 --> 33:30.580
you will still appear to
work for the government.

33:30.580 --> 33:32.900
But you do not work for the government.

33:32.900 --> 33:33.860
You work for the country.

33:35.620 --> 33:37.260
Prime Ministers come and go.

33:38.820 --> 33:42.060
We will be tasked with
actions that we support,

33:42.060 --> 33:43.900
and some we question.

33:43.900 --> 33:47.060
Regardless, we do our job,

33:47.060 --> 33:48.780
and are always... Neutral.

33:52.260 --> 33:53.900
Now, go home and get some sleep.

33:59.060 --> 34:01.540
Oh, wait. One more thing.

34:01.540 --> 34:05.940
I don't suppose you
recognise this address?

34:05.940 --> 34:07.740
It was in the Russian fellow's pocket.

34:10.739 --> 34:14.100
Uh, that's my friend's
address Hugh Fenton.

34:14.100 --> 34:16.100
The chap on the Palestine committee?

34:18.739 --> 34:21.139
In our line of work,

34:21.139 --> 34:23.980
intimates can be
something of a liability.

34:23.980 --> 34:25.460
The best way to protect our very

34:25.460 --> 34:28.699
close friends is to keep our distance.

34:28.699 --> 34:30.659
It's not a rule.

34:30.659 --> 34:31.659
It's just a fact.

34:37.420 --> 34:38.420
Yes.

34:54.179 --> 34:56.659
There's a story I always
wanted to tell you about.

34:57.980 --> 34:59.900
Maybe because you have a twin, and all.

35:02.140 --> 35:05.180
Me and my brother loved fishing.

35:05.180 --> 35:07.660
The summer we turned eight,

35:07.660 --> 35:08.980
we were twins too, you see.

35:10.820 --> 35:13.340
They let us go without any
grown-ups and right off the bat,

35:13.340 --> 35:15.340
we caught a giant silver sturgeon.

35:19.220 --> 35:21.860
And we were whooping and yelling,

35:21.860 --> 35:24.340
both of us on the rod
dragging it up the bank.

35:25.740 --> 35:29.020
But that thing must've been
playing dead or something.

35:29.020 --> 35:32.260
Because the second we got
the hook out his mouth,

35:32.260 --> 35:34.980
it shimmied back down over
the grass and into the water.

35:36.820 --> 35:38.260
Best thing I ever saw...

35:39.460 --> 35:40.900
..the way it fought to get home.

35:43.540 --> 35:44.740
I wanted to say goodbye.

35:46.540 --> 35:48.140
And I wanted to say more.

35:49.820 --> 35:51.460
And this is what I came up with.

35:54.180 --> 35:55.260
I'm going home.

35:56.620 --> 35:57.820
I know you'll be OK.

35:59.860 --> 36:02.300
First time I saw you,
I thought of that silver fish.

36:05.500 --> 36:08.740
I remain, faithfully yours.

36:09.820 --> 36:10.820
Jackson.

36:38.500 --> 36:40.460
Hey.

36:40.460 --> 36:41.460
I missed you.

36:45.100 --> 36:47.380
Where have you been?

36:47.380 --> 36:49.140
I'm sorry, you must've been worried.

36:54.980 --> 36:56.940
Where were you?

36:56.940 --> 36:58.580
Hospital.

36:58.580 --> 37:02.460
A taxi cab caught me as I was
crossing the road. I'm fine.

37:02.460 --> 37:05.380
Just a few bruises,
but they kept me in for observation.

37:07.860 --> 37:09.300
You weren't in the hospital.

37:12.940 --> 37:15.740
You were fucking an American. What?

37:15.740 --> 37:18.180
He popped by the flat to say goodbye.

37:18.180 --> 37:20.500
You've been seeing this
whole time, haven't you...

37:20.500 --> 37:21.740
No, no. ..this whole time? No.

37:24.460 --> 37:25.740
I want to marry you.

37:28.740 --> 37:31.820
I want to spend my whole life with you.

37:37.260 --> 37:39.020
But...

37:39.020 --> 37:40.260
..I have to trust you.

37:45.300 --> 37:46.660
I have to trust you.

37:57.060 --> 37:58.940
I love the idea of us married.

38:01.300 --> 38:03.580
With a garden, and...

38:03.580 --> 38:04.460
..and a dog.

38:08.100 --> 38:09.780
I'd weed flowerbeds.

38:16.620 --> 38:18.140
If you were in the hospital...

38:20.100 --> 38:21.260
..show me a bruise.

38:24.580 --> 38:26.820
Show me a single bloody bruise.

38:48.300 --> 38:49.660
I loved knowing you.

39:29.700 --> 39:32.060
It will be announced formally tomorrow,

39:32.060 --> 39:34.540
but I wanted to tell you personally.
The committee has agreed...

39:34.540 --> 39:36.540
Not in the house. Out.

39:36.540 --> 39:37.540
I'm sorry.

39:39.180 --> 39:45.020
..the committee has agreed to let
the 100,000 refugees into Palestine.

39:45.020 --> 39:46.380
We had no choice.

39:46.380 --> 39:48.420
It's a moral imperative. That's...

39:48.420 --> 39:49.940
Thank you.

39:49.940 --> 39:51.580
And we've also made a series of

39:51.580 --> 39:53.500
recommendations about Palestine itself.

39:53.500 --> 39:56.460
Yes, the Jews have an undeniable claim.

39:56.460 --> 39:59.820
Yes, we British must
give up the mandate.

39:59.820 --> 40:02.420
But Arabs live there,
farm there, work there.

40:02.420 --> 40:03.780
They never left.

40:03.780 --> 40:06.580
They have a claim too,
equally undeniable.

40:08.460 --> 40:13.660
So, what we've decided is that
there can be a two-part solution.

40:13.660 --> 40:15.300
Split the country down the middle.

40:15.300 --> 40:17.660
Half for the Arabs, half for the Jews.

40:17.660 --> 40:20.060
It will take some negotiating,
but we can get it done.

40:22.300 --> 40:24.140
That sounds wonderful.

40:24.140 --> 40:26.460
Obviously, keep this to yourself.

40:26.460 --> 40:29.020
But, like I said,
I wanted to tell you personally.

40:29.020 --> 40:30.460
I've thought about you a lot.

40:32.460 --> 40:35.220
Sorry, that wasn't meant
to be a line or anything.

40:35.220 --> 40:36.820
I'm married. Oh.

40:50.700 --> 40:53.380
This is Neville Chambers. MI6.

40:53.380 --> 40:55.740
Obviously, he's not talking
to us in that capacity.

40:55.740 --> 40:58.420
This is just a chum
introducing some chums.

40:58.420 --> 41:00.220
Herbert Quick, of the Treasury.

41:00.220 --> 41:01.900
Nice to meet you, chum.

41:07.420 --> 41:10.500
The Palestine committee are being
piously tight-lipped, and I don't

41:10.500 --> 41:13.140
know if either of you know what
they will announce tomorrow,

41:13.140 --> 41:17.220
but I do feel duty
bound to tell you this.

41:17.220 --> 41:19.100
Britain has dominated the Middle East

41:19.100 --> 41:21.500
and her resources for
the last hundred years.

41:21.500 --> 41:23.900
We are now dependant on those resources.

41:23.900 --> 41:25.820
We constructed and control two oil

41:25.820 --> 41:28.140
pipelines from Iraq
to the Mediterranean.

41:28.140 --> 41:29.660
One through Syria to the Coast,

41:29.660 --> 41:32.300
another through Trans-Jordan
to Haifa in Palestine.

41:33.740 --> 41:37.300
In order to continue
producing and transporting oil,

41:37.300 --> 41:39.140
we need to keep the Arabs happy.

41:39.140 --> 41:43.060
If the committee angers the Arabs,

41:43.060 --> 41:46.500
you'll need to find a
way to keep them happy.

41:46.500 --> 41:48.420
Diplomacy will not suffice.

41:49.580 --> 41:50.580
Understood.

41:59.660 --> 42:01.580
For the last six months,

42:01.580 --> 42:04.420
representatives of the
British and American governments

42:04.420 --> 42:07.260
have been deciding on the
fate of Jewish refugees,

42:07.260 --> 42:10.780
who are attempting to settle in
British controlled Palestine.

42:10.780 --> 42:14.140
The Arab League, defending the
interests of those who could lose

42:14.140 --> 42:19.380
their land, had strongly opposed the
idea of refugees entering Palestine.

42:19.380 --> 42:22.860
Britain, who relies on the support
of their Middle Eastern partners

42:22.860 --> 42:27.260
for its oil, had been expected
to listen to their concerns.

42:27.260 --> 42:31.340
But today, the committee has
decided to allow these long-suffering

42:31.340 --> 42:34.380
refugees back to what is
their ancestral homeland.

42:46.060 --> 42:48.460
Despite what the committee has decided,

42:48.460 --> 42:51.180
we need to protect our oil
interests in the Middle East.

42:52.900 --> 42:54.700
The boats are in France.

42:54.700 --> 42:57.060
You boys will be dressed as engineers.

42:57.060 --> 42:59.700
You will enter the
boat the night before.

42:59.700 --> 43:02.300
The refugees will not yet have boarded.

43:02.300 --> 43:04.100
You will get on board and below deck,

43:04.100 --> 43:06.020
where you will assemble the devices.

43:06.020 --> 43:08.340
They take seven minutes to detonate.

43:08.340 --> 43:11.460
After the explosion,
you will go to the police.

43:11.460 --> 43:16.020
Say that you saw men,
engineers you assumed, board the boats.

43:16.020 --> 43:18.740
Say these men had
Russian accents, all right?

43:21.140 --> 43:23.660
This is top secret.

43:23.660 --> 43:26.860
No-one knows about it,
except the Prime Minister.

43:26.860 --> 43:29.860
But the tide of
refugees must be stemmed.

43:29.860 --> 43:32.220
In this last year of Labour government,

43:32.220 --> 43:35.580
we have placed a heavier and more
important programme of legislation

43:35.580 --> 43:38.980
than has been submitted in
any previous Parliament.

43:38.980 --> 43:40.820
Here, here.

43:40.820 --> 43:44.420
In every sphere of government,
you have seen our Socialist impulse.

43:44.420 --> 43:46.780
Our Socialist outlook.

43:46.780 --> 43:49.300
We have led the world
in workers' rights.

43:49.300 --> 43:50.900
We have led the way in health,

43:50.900 --> 43:53.140
in housing, in education.

43:54.340 --> 43:56.340
Abroad, we have sought to help all

43:56.340 --> 43:59.060
our fellow men towards self-government.

43:59.060 --> 44:01.420
And we have moved
towards solving the great,

44:01.420 --> 44:04.300
inherited problem of
India and Palestine,

44:04.300 --> 44:05.540
and the Colonial Empire.

44:07.620 --> 44:10.900
It was left to us to deal
with the muddle of the past.

44:10.900 --> 44:13.500
We have met that challenge with faith.

44:13.500 --> 44:17.340
The faith that has carried us to
power after years of striving.

44:17.340 --> 44:20.020
The faith that can remove mountains.

44:20.020 --> 44:22.900
The faith in the common people.

44:22.900 --> 44:25.940
The faith that can
build a world of peace.

44:25.940 --> 44:27.660
A world of justice.

44:27.660 --> 44:29.460
A world of freedom.

44:29.460 --> 44:30.900
A world of happiness for all.

44:32.300 --> 44:33.460
In that faith...

44:34.980 --> 44:36.540
..we shall conquer.

44:36.540 --> 44:37.780
Hear!

45:18.500 --> 45:20.060
