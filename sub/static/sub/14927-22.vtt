WEBVTT

00:04.405 --> 00:05.706
BACK, DAD, BACK.

00:05.739 --> 00:07.741
OK.

00:08.776 --> 00:10.078
ALL RIGHT, THROW IT!

00:10.111 --> 00:11.179
BACK FURTHER!

00:11.212 --> 00:13.647
YOU CAN'T THROW IT
THIS FAR, HENRY.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.316
GO.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.518
OK.

00:18.752 --> 00:21.021
ALL RIGHT, THROW IT!

00:26.094 --> 00:28.529
GET IT.
YOU GET IT.

00:28.562 --> 00:29.597
YOU GET IT.

00:29.630 --> 00:32.100
IT'S CLOSER TO YOU.

00:38.439 --> 00:40.608
HEY, JIMMY.
WANNA PLAY SOME BALL?

00:40.641 --> 00:42.510
I CAN'T.
I GOT HOMEWORK.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.278
WHAT'S WITH
YOUR HAIR?

00:44.312 --> 00:45.045
NOTHING.

00:45.079 --> 00:46.214
IT IS KIND OF
A NEW LOOK FOR YOU,

00:46.247 --> 00:47.315
A LITTLE, UH,

00:47.348 --> 00:49.117
QUADROPHENIA SGT. PEPPER'S
MOP TOP THING, HUH?

00:49.150 --> 00:51.185
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
A WORD YOU JUST SAID.

00:51.219 --> 00:53.121
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.
GO DO YOUR HOMEWORK.

00:53.154 --> 00:54.188
STOP!

00:54.222 --> 00:55.289
WHOA! WHAT'S THAT
ON YOUR HEAD?

00:55.323 --> 00:58.459
NOTHING!
IT'S A HUGE ZIT!

00:58.492 --> 01:00.228
SHUT UP!

01:00.428 --> 01:02.396
WHATEVER.
COME ON, DAD,
HIT ME!

01:02.430 --> 01:05.099
I'M WIDE OPEN!
GO DEEP,
BUDDY, GO DEEP!

01:06.900 --> 01:08.202
YOU OK?

01:08.236 --> 01:09.370
I CAUGHT IT!

01:09.403 --> 01:11.872
GOOD JOB, BUDDY.
ALL RIGHT!

01:11.905 --> 01:15.843
OK.
OH, LOOK AT THIS.

01:18.512 --> 01:19.580
OH, LILY!

01:19.613 --> 01:23.284
I GIVE HER A NEW CLASH CD,
AND SHE JUST THROWS IT AWAY.

01:24.218 --> 01:26.220
OH, MY GOD.

01:27.521 --> 01:28.622
Henry:
WHAT IS IT, DAD?

01:28.656 --> 01:33.227
UH, THE GUY FROM 'NSYNC'S
LOOKING FOR THE PERFECT GIRL.

01:33.261 --> 01:34.162
LET ME SEE THAT.

01:34.195 --> 01:37.898
NO, NO, NO.
LOOK, GO--GO--GO DEEP.
GO LONG.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.833
GO, GO!

01:39.867 --> 01:41.835
KEEP GOING.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.405
GOD, LILY.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.380
I'M OPEN,
DAD!

02:18.606 --> 02:20.608
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

02:20.941 --> 02:24.212
WE'RE WAITING FOR LILY
TO GET HOME.

02:24.245 --> 02:25.779
HOW COME?

02:27.281 --> 02:28.816
PREGNANCY TEST?

02:28.849 --> 02:30.184
YEP.
OH, MAN.

02:30.218 --> 02:31.952
YEAH.
OH, MAN.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.354
I KNOW.

02:33.387 --> 02:34.288
THIS IS SERIOUS.

02:34.322 --> 02:35.356
I KNOW.
OH, MAN.

02:35.389 --> 02:36.924
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO HER,
YOU KNOW?

02:36.957 --> 02:39.493
WHAT DO I SAY?
"HOW WAS SCHOOL?
HOW WAS HISTORY?

02:39.527 --> 02:43.697
HOW'S FRENCH?
UH, ANYTHING NEW
IN YOUR UTERUS?"

02:44.965 --> 02:46.700
SO WHO DO YOU THINK
THE FATHER IS?

02:46.734 --> 02:48.802
I MEAN,
IT COULD BE ANYBODY.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.338
NO, IT COULDN'T!

02:50.371 --> 02:52.540
COME ON, IT'S GOTTA BE
HER BOYFRIEND DEAN.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.942
AH, GOD.
HOW COULD I HAVE BEEN
SO BLIND, ED?

02:54.975 --> 02:58.812
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
THE SIGNS WERE IN FRONT
OF ME ALL THE TIME.

02:58.846 --> 02:59.947
LILY, YOU OK?

02:59.980 --> 03:03.217
OH, I'M FINE. HEH.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.656
YOU GOT ME
INTO THIS, DEAN,

03:08.689 --> 03:10.758
AND THEN YOU JUST
ABANDONED ME.

03:10.791 --> 03:14.962
OH, YEAH, I'LL MEET
YOU AT MOCHA JOJO'S
AT 3:00.

03:14.995 --> 03:17.231
THAT'LL BE FUN.

03:17.265 --> 03:20.934
NO, I WILL NOT MEET YOU
AT MOCHA JOJO'S,
YOU IDIOT!

03:21.669 --> 03:22.202
LILY?

03:22.236 --> 03:23.537
SWEETIE,
DO YOU WANT US

03:23.571 --> 03:24.705
TO TAKE YOU
TO THE DOCTOR?

03:24.738 --> 03:25.939
Lily: NO!
NO.

03:27.107 --> 03:29.977
LOOK, YOU GUYS,
IT'S PROBABLY JUST
FOOD POISONING, OK?

03:30.010 --> 03:34.948
THAT'LL TEACH ME TO EAT
FROM ONE OF THOSE
ROTATING MEAT MACHINES.

03:40.321 --> 03:42.290
SO MAYBE SHE'S
TELLING THE TRUTH.

03:42.323 --> 03:45.359
SHE COULD HAVE EATEN
FROM THE CORE OF THE MEAT.

03:45.393 --> 03:47.027
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

03:47.060 --> 03:48.729
THEY NEVER SWITCH OUT
THE CORE ON THOSE THINGS.

03:48.762 --> 03:51.765
THEY JUST ATTACH
PIECES OF LAMB
BACK ONTO IT

03:51.799 --> 03:52.933
WITH A SPECIAL GLUE.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.802
YOU DON'T TAKE
A PREGNANCY TEST

03:54.835 --> 03:56.036
WHEN YOU EAT
BAD MEAT.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.538
FINE. YOU KNOW,
SHE'S PREGNANT, OK.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.373
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

03:59.407 --> 04:00.908
GOD,
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

04:00.941 --> 04:04.378
I MEAN, COME ON,
I THOUGHT LILY WAS
SMARTER THAN THIS.

04:04.412 --> 04:08.248
WHY? YOU AND CLAUDIA
WEREN'T.

04:08.782 --> 04:11.985
Sean: OH, BABY,
I WANT YOU SO BAD!

04:13.321 --> 04:13.954
DO YOU HAVE A CONDOM?

04:13.987 --> 04:15.088
NO. I WAS GONNA
BRING ONE,

04:15.122 --> 04:18.626
BUT I DIDN'T
WANT YOU TO THINK I WAS
ONE OF THOSE GUYS

04:18.659 --> 04:21.061
WHO WAS, YOU KNOW,
READY FOR ACTION.

04:21.094 --> 04:24.698
THAT'S SO SWEET.

04:27.034 --> 04:28.001
DO YOU HAVE ONE?

04:28.035 --> 04:28.869
NO.

04:28.902 --> 04:31.872
I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO THINK I'M A SKANK.

04:31.905 --> 04:34.375
OH, BABY,
YOU'RE SO NOT A SKANK.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.979
WE JUST--WE BETTER
COOL IT, THEN.

04:39.012 --> 04:40.748
YEAH.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.057
WELL, LOOK AT
THE BRIGHT SIDE--

04:50.090 --> 04:51.692
YOU'RE GONNA BE
A GRANDFATHER.

04:51.725 --> 04:52.726
HOW IS THAT
THE BRIGHT SIDE?

04:52.760 --> 04:55.062
'CAUSE YOU GET TO HAVE
ALL THE FUN OF HAVING A BABY

04:55.095 --> 04:56.964
WITH NONE OF
THE RESPONSIBILITIES.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.866
COME ON, I'M STILL
SUPPORTING THE MOTHER!

04:58.899 --> 05:01.034
I'LL HAVE TWICE
THE RESPONSIBILITIES!

05:01.068 --> 05:04.104
CALM DOWN, GRAMPS.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A HEART ATTACK.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.406
OH, GOD!

05:05.439 --> 05:06.740
WHY ARE YOU
HIDING IT?

05:06.774 --> 05:09.309
LOOK, JUST
LEAVE ME ALONE.

05:09.610 --> 05:10.511
WHAT'S WITH THE HAT?

05:10.544 --> 05:13.381
JIMMY'S GOT
A HUGE ZIT.

05:14.081 --> 05:15.082
SO WHAT?

05:15.115 --> 05:15.783
SO WHAT?

05:15.816 --> 05:18.852
THIS THING IS
RUINING MY LIFE.

05:18.886 --> 05:21.389
WHEN YOU HAVE AN EQUATION
WITH 2 VARIABLES,

05:21.422 --> 05:24.057
YOU HAVE TO SOLVE "X"
IN TERMS OF "Y,"

05:24.091 --> 05:26.660
OR "Y" IN TERMS OF "X."

05:26.694 --> 05:30.063
YOU'RE LOOKING AT MY ZIT,
AREN'T YOU?

05:30.097 --> 05:32.065
NO.

05:35.536 --> 05:38.539
COME ON, JIMMY.
IT'S--IT'S NOT THAT BIG.

05:38.572 --> 05:39.339
IT'S ENORMOUS.

05:39.373 --> 05:42.075
IT'S LIKE I'M GROWING
A SECOND HEAD.

05:43.076 --> 05:46.480
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU SHOULD GIVE IT
A NAME.

05:46.514 --> 05:49.049
YOU SHOULD GET
OUT OF MY FACE.

05:49.082 --> 05:50.818
WHICH ONE?

05:52.185 --> 05:54.087
Jimmy: SHUT UP!

05:56.590 --> 05:58.058
HEY,
UNCLE EDDIE.

05:58.091 --> 05:59.159
HEY, LOOK AT YOU.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.729
YOU'RE GLOWING.

06:03.497 --> 06:04.264
I AM?

06:04.297 --> 06:06.734
LILY, HEY.
SO GOOD TO
SEE YOU HOME.

06:06.767 --> 06:07.635
HEH. HEY, DAD.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.136
I'M GOING OUT.
I'M GOING OUT.

06:09.169 --> 06:13.507
I'M GOING...
SOMEWHERE.

06:14.608 --> 06:17.445
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

06:17.478 --> 06:18.412
NOT MUCH.

06:18.446 --> 06:19.513
DID I GET ANY CALLS?

06:19.547 --> 06:22.983
OH, ARE YOU
EXPECTING A CALL,
PERHAPS FROM DEAN?

06:23.016 --> 06:25.018
YES. MAYBE.
WHAT DID HE SAY?

06:25.052 --> 06:26.554
WELL, WHAT SHOULD
HE BE SAYING?

06:26.587 --> 06:28.656
UH, HEH.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

06:28.689 --> 06:30.591
WELL, WHAT SHOULD
I MEAN?

06:30.624 --> 06:32.693
OK. WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU?

06:32.726 --> 06:33.794
OH, NOTHING'S WRONG
WITH ME.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.596
I FEEL GREAT,
AND YOU KNOW WHY, MISSY?

06:35.629 --> 06:37.465
BECAUSE
I'M NOT PREGNANT!

06:37.498 --> 06:38.466
OK!

06:38.499 --> 06:40.701
HEY, I FOUND THIS
IN YOUR GARBAGE.

06:40.734 --> 06:41.602
WHAT IS THAT?

06:41.635 --> 06:43.170
IT'S YOUR
PREGNANCY TEST!

06:43.203 --> 06:45.473
OH, DEAR GOD.

06:45.506 --> 06:46.807
THAT'S NOT MINE.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.175
COME ON, COME ON--
ALL THE THROWING UP.

06:48.208 --> 06:50.210
I KNOW
MORNING SICKNESS
WHEN I SEE IT.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.580
WHY DIDN'T I JUST DIE
ON THE WAY OVER HERE?

06:52.613 --> 06:53.981
IT'S NOT MORNING SICKNESS.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.549
IT'S FROM MY ANTIBIOTICS.

06:55.583 --> 06:58.185
YOU'RE TAKING
ANTIBIOTICS?

06:58.218 --> 06:59.219
FOR WHAT?

06:59.252 --> 07:01.689
WELL, I DIDN'T WANT
TO TELL YOU.

07:01.722 --> 07:04.224
I--I DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D APPROVE.

07:04.257 --> 07:07.227
I DON'T KNOW, BABY.
A TATTOO IS LIKE FOREVER.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.497
OH.
I'LL GET A SERPENT,

07:09.530 --> 07:11.031
AND YOU CAN GET
AN APPLE.

07:11.064 --> 07:12.466
SO THAT WAY,
WHEN WE GET CLOSE,

07:12.500 --> 07:15.936
IT LOOKS LIKE MY SERPENT
IS EATING YOUR APPLE.

07:15.969 --> 07:16.770
EW.

07:16.804 --> 07:19.206
FINE. THEN WHAT DO
YOU WANT US TO GET?

07:19.239 --> 07:20.140
I DON'T KNOW.

07:20.173 --> 07:22.610
MAYBE YOU CAN GET A YIN,
AND I'LL GET A YANG.

07:22.643 --> 07:23.744
COOL.
LET'S DO IT.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.145
YOU'RE SURE ABOUT THIS?

07:25.178 --> 07:26.614
YES. LET'S DO IT.
COME ON.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.582
IT'LL BE SO ROMANTIC.

07:28.616 --> 07:30.150
OHH! OW, OW, OW, OW!

07:30.183 --> 07:31.519
OW! OW!

07:31.552 --> 07:33.621

AAH, AY! AY! YA! YA!

ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE DONE.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.828
OH, THANK GOD.

07:40.861 --> 07:43.897
OHH! OK, BABY.
YOU'RE UP.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.466
UNH!

07:47.167 --> 07:49.169
DEAN? DEAN!

07:49.202 --> 07:53.206
YOU...WANT ME TO PUT
HIS YIN ON YOUR YANG?

07:53.240 --> 07:56.510
JUST GIVE ME A BAND-AID,
YOU FREAK.

07:56.544 --> 07:59.046
YOU GOT A TATTOO?
YES! WHOO!

07:59.079 --> 08:01.148
OH, GOD! THANK YOU!
THANK YOU!

08:01.181 --> 08:02.049
YOU'RE NOT MAD?

08:02.082 --> 08:02.816
OH, NO. IN AN HOUR,
I'M GONNA BE FURIOUS,

08:02.850 --> 08:04.585
BUT RIGHT NOW
I'M ECSTATIC! YEAH!

08:04.618 --> 08:06.286
* WHOO! MY BABY GIRL'S
NOT PREGNANT! *

08:06.319 --> 08:08.622
* SHE WASN'T GETTIN' IT ON,
ALL RIGHT! *

08:08.656 --> 08:10.524
SEAN?
UH, YEAH, DAD?

08:10.558 --> 08:12.660
WHERE'S CLAUDIA?

08:13.927 --> 08:15.062
OH, GOD.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.263
YEAH.

08:16.296 --> 08:18.766
OH, GOD.
I KNOW.

08:19.066 --> 08:20.167
OH, GOD.
I KNOW.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.003
THIS IS SERIOUS.
I KNOW.

08:23.036 --> 08:25.005
OH, JEEZ.
I KNOW.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.006
OH, DADDY.

08:26.039 --> 08:29.276
I KNOW. I KNOW.
I KNOW.

08:31.211 --> 08:32.145
I CAN'T BELIEVE
MOM'S PREGNANT.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.181
MAN, WE'RE GONNA BE
BROTHERS!

08:34.214 --> 08:36.016
WE ALREADY ARE.

08:36.049 --> 08:36.984
OH, MY GOD.

08:37.017 --> 08:40.153
AM I GONNA
HAVE TO SHARE MY ROOM
WITH A BABY?

08:40.187 --> 08:44.858
OH, GOD, I HAVE
THE MOST IRRESPONSIBLE FATHER
IN THE ENTIRE WORLD.

08:44.892 --> 08:47.227
YOU SHOULD'VE KNOWN HIM
WHEN HE WAS A TEENAGER.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.962
OH, BOY!

08:50.097 --> 08:52.165
SEAN, COULD YOU HOLD
ONE END FOR ME?

08:52.199 --> 08:54.935
DAD, THIS IS KIND OF
AN IMPORTANT CALL,
ALL RIGHT?

08:54.968 --> 08:56.169
IS THIS ABOUT THAT JOB,
SEANNY?

08:56.203 --> 08:57.971
SHH! SHH!

09:31.404 --> 09:33.807
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED

09:33.841 --> 09:34.775
DAD, IT'S GONNA BE

09:34.808 --> 09:36.944
THE SINGLE
MOST HISTORICAL EVENT
OF OUR TIME.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.245
YOU KNOW, ALL THESE BANDS
ARE GONNA BE THERE,

09:38.278 --> 09:39.913
AND PHIL COLLINS
IS PLAYING IN LONDON,

09:39.947 --> 09:41.048
AND THEN HE'S GONNA FLY
ON THE CONCORDE

09:41.081 --> 09:42.616
AND HE'S GONNA PLAY
IN PHILADELPHIA,

09:42.650 --> 09:45.052
AND ALL THESE OTHER BANDS
ARE GONNA BE THERE.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.987
HOW IS THAT
A HISTORICAL EVENT?

09:47.020 --> 09:48.789
THEY'RE GONNA END
WORLD HUNGER,

09:48.822 --> 09:51.792
AND OZZY'S
GONNA BE THERE.

09:51.825 --> 09:52.559
HEY, BABE.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.161
BABY, WE GOT TICKETS
FOR LIVE AID!

09:54.194 --> 09:56.797
WE CAN'T GO
TO LIVE AID.
WHY NOT?

09:56.830 --> 09:58.699
'CAUSE I'M
8 1/2 MONTHS PREGNANT.

09:58.732 --> 10:01.134
SO? YOU STILL GOT
A COUPLE WEEKS.
WE CAN MAKE IT.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.036
YEAH, AND THE FIRST ONE'S
ALWAYS LATE.

10:03.070 --> 10:05.105
I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR!

10:05.138 --> 10:07.174
WHAT?

10:07.207 --> 10:08.208
I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

10:08.241 --> 10:13.346
CLAUD, THIS MAY BE
THE BEST IDEA
WE'VE EVER HAD.

10:13.380 --> 10:17.050
WHAT IS WRONG WITH MEN?!
THEY ARE SO SELFISH!

10:17.084 --> 10:18.151
YOU KNOW,
DAD IS JUST LIKE DEAN.

10:18.185 --> 10:20.287
WHENEVER
THEY WANT SOMETHING,
YOU DON'T MATTER AT ALL.

10:20.320 --> 10:24.825
OH, MY GOD!
I COULD HAVE BEEN BORN
AT SOME LAME CONCERT

10:24.858 --> 10:27.094
IN PHILADELPHIA!

10:28.261 --> 10:30.130
YEAH.

10:31.832 --> 10:34.434
YOU COULD'VE BEEN.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.369
GRANDPA...

10:36.403 --> 10:40.007
LILY, I JUST DID YOU
A HUGE SOLID.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.041
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT?

10:41.074 --> 10:43.844
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
STANDING UP
IN YOUR CONDITION?

10:43.877 --> 10:44.745
WHAT?

10:44.778 --> 10:47.047
LOOK AT HER, DAD.
SHE'S ALL ROSY AND DEWY.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.683
OH, EDDIE,
WHAT DID YOU DO?

10:49.717 --> 10:52.119
OH, JUST LOOKIN' OUT FOR YOU
IN YOUR TIME OF NEED.

10:52.152 --> 10:57.858
HAD A LITTLE CHAT
WITH YOUR LOVERBOY
OUTSIDE THE BAKERY.

11:03.296 --> 11:03.931
HELLO, DEAN.

11:03.964 --> 11:06.066
MMM, EDDIE,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:06.099 --> 11:08.736
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?
JELLY DOUGHNUT, EH?
YEAH.

11:08.769 --> 11:09.903
IT'S GOOD, HUH?
YEAH,
IT'S GREAT.

11:09.937 --> 11:12.172
HOW CAN YOU JUST EAT THAT
AFTER WHAT YOU DID
TO MY NIECE?

11:12.205 --> 11:13.240
ALL RIGHT, LOOK--
YEAH!

11:13.273 --> 11:15.308
LOOK, ALL RIGHT,
IT WASN'T WHAT
I WANTED TO HAPPEN.

11:15.342 --> 11:18.145
YOU KNOW,
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
ROMANTIC, SORT OF.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.079
OH, YEAH?

11:19.112 --> 11:21.381
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE
THE ONLY KIDS DOING IT.

11:21.414 --> 11:24.151
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE SAID
IT WOULD BE FUN,
YOU KNOW?

11:24.184 --> 11:27.387
IN, OUT, YOU'RE DONE.
NO BIG DEAL.

11:27.420 --> 11:30.958
BUT THEN LILY--
SHE STARTED SCREAMING,
YOU KNOW?

11:30.991 --> 11:32.092
THINGS GOT
A LITTLE MESSY.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.326
WATCH YOUR MOUTH,
ALL RIGHT?

11:33.360 --> 11:35.863
LOOK, ALL RIGHT?
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME
FOR BOTH OF US, HERE.

11:35.896 --> 11:36.997
WE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT WE WERE DOING!

11:37.030 --> 11:38.932
MAYBE WE SHOULD'VE GONE
TO A CLASSIER PLACE,
YOU KNOW?

11:38.966 --> 11:40.267
THERE WERE
ALL THE BIKERS
SITTING AROUND

11:40.300 --> 11:42.202
WATCHING US,
WAITING FOR THEIR TURN.

11:42.235 --> 11:45.138
YOU--YOU ARE GONNA DIE.

11:45.172 --> 11:46.373
I SAID I WAS SORRY!

11:46.406 --> 11:47.507
SORRY?!

11:47.540 --> 11:50.110
LISTEN, WHAT YOU GOTTA DO NOW
IS STAND UP AND BE A MAN.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.078
ALL RIGHT? BE A MAN.

11:51.111 --> 11:53.981
WHAT YOU DID
TO THAT LITTLE GIRL
IS FOREVER!

11:54.014 --> 11:54.681
CALM DOWN!

11:54.714 --> 11:56.283
IF SHE DOESN'T WANT IT
ANYMORE,

11:56.316 --> 11:58.085
SHE CAN GET RID OF IT
WITH A LASER.

11:58.118 --> 12:00.087
OK, NOW YOU'RE DEAD!

12:02.322 --> 12:05.258
YOU'RE LUCKY
I'M WEARING CLOGS.

12:07.194 --> 12:09.229
SO GOOD NEWS AND GOOD NEWS.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.231
HE WON'T BE BOTHERING YOU
ANYMORE,

12:11.264 --> 12:13.166
AND I'VE GOT PIE.

12:14.101 --> 12:16.069
OK, FIRST OF ALL,
IF I WAS PREGNANT,

12:16.103 --> 12:18.205
WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO SCARE THE FATHER
AWAY?!

12:18.238 --> 12:19.873
AND SECOND,
I'M NOT PREGNANT!

12:19.907 --> 12:22.375
I'VE GOT
AN INFECTED TATTOO!

12:24.511 --> 12:26.113
DAD, YOU WANT PIE?

12:26.146 --> 12:28.081
YEAH.

12:29.282 --> 12:30.183
HI, EVERYBODY.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.418
CLAUDIA,
YOU SHOULDN'T BE
CARRYING THAT BAG!

12:31.451 --> 12:32.319
THAT'S OK, WALT.
I GOT IT.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.988
NO, I'LL TAKE IT.
REALLY, IT'S NOT HEAVY.

12:35.022 --> 12:36.289
NO, NO, NO, PLEASE.
YOU REST.

12:36.323 --> 12:38.391
I'LL PUT IT
IN THE KITCHEN
FOR YOU.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.861
OK--DON'T TOUCH MY BAG!

12:42.930 --> 12:45.132
SHE'S IRRITABLE.

12:45.165 --> 12:48.301
THAT MEANS IT'S A BOY.

12:48.836 --> 12:51.504
OH, HEY, SEANY,
SORRY I'M LATE.
THAT STORE WAS MOBBED!

12:51.538 --> 12:53.807
THEY WERE OUT OF
CREAM AND CHICKEN
SOUP!

12:53.841 --> 12:55.275
SO I HAD TO GET
CREAM OF MUSHROOM,

12:55.308 --> 12:56.576
WHICH I KNOW THE KIDS
HATE MUSHROOMS,

12:56.609 --> 12:58.846
BUT THEY CAN PICK OUT
THE MUSHROOMS, 'CAUSE
YOU LIKE MUSHROOMS.

12:58.879 --> 13:01.949
OH, I LOVE MUSHROOMS,
AND YOU'RE PREGNANT.

13:01.982 --> 13:03.250
WHAT?

13:03.283 --> 13:05.085
I KNOW YOU'RE PREGNANT.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.453
I'M NOT PREGNANT.

13:06.486 --> 13:07.520
YOU'RE NOT?

13:07.554 --> 13:08.088
NO, I--

13:08.121 --> 13:10.357
I MIGHT...
BE PREGNANT.

13:10.390 --> 13:11.358
YOU MIGHT BE? COME ON!

13:11.391 --> 13:14.027
THE STUPID TEST
WAS INCONCLUSIVE.

13:14.061 --> 13:16.930
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LOOK
FOR A PLUS OR A MINUS,

13:16.964 --> 13:18.131
BUT IT DIDN'T
LOOK LIKE EITHER,

13:18.165 --> 13:21.835
THEN WHEN IT DRIED,
IT LOOKED LIKE
A DIVISION SIGN, AND...

13:21.869 --> 13:24.404
THEY SAID TO WAIT
A COUPLE DAYS AND THEN
JUST TAKE ANOTHER TEST.

13:24.437 --> 13:26.539
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
COME ON, TAKE IT!

13:26.573 --> 13:28.008
I CAN'T.
WHY NOT?

13:28.041 --> 13:29.442
I DON'T HAVE TO PEE!

13:29.476 --> 13:32.312
WELL, COME ON!
JEEZ! START DRINKING!

13:32.345 --> 13:34.181
HERE.

13:35.382 --> 13:36.049
BEER?

13:36.083 --> 13:38.051
OH, NO, NO,
DON'T DRINK BEER.

13:38.085 --> 13:39.319
I'LL DRINK BEER.
I NEED A BEER.

13:39.352 --> 13:41.855
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED?
YOU NEED TO RELAX.

13:41.889 --> 13:43.523
BABY, I CAN'T.
COME ON, ANOTHER BABY?

13:43.556 --> 13:46.026
WE WERE JUST GETTING
OUR LIVES BACK TO NORMAL,

13:46.059 --> 13:47.227
THE TV'S NOT STICKY
ANYMORE.

13:47.260 --> 13:49.262
WE CAN KEEP SHARP
OBJECTS AROUND THE HOUSE,

13:49.296 --> 13:51.231
AND LOOK--I CAN
OPEN THE CABINET
UNDER THE SINK,

13:51.264 --> 13:54.167
AND I DON'T HAVE
TO PRESS ANYTHING DOWN!
SEE? IT'S OPEN!

13:54.201 --> 13:57.304
SO WHAT? YOU THINK
I DON'T LIKE OPENING
CABINETS?

13:57.337 --> 13:58.205
I LOVE OPENING CABINETS!

13:58.238 --> 14:01.308
I DON'T THINK YOU DO
LOVE OPENING CABINETS.

14:01.341 --> 14:04.544
YOU'RE AWFULLY DAMN
CALM ABOUT ALL THIS.

14:04.577 --> 14:07.247
YEAH, WELL, YOU SHOULD
HAVE SEEN ME ON TUESDAY.

14:07.280 --> 14:10.283
I CAN'T BE LATE...
I CAN'T BE LATE!

14:10.317 --> 14:12.886
OH, GOD, I'M NEVER LATE!

14:12.920 --> 14:15.288
I'M DEFINITELY LATE!

14:17.991 --> 14:18.825
UUGGGH!

14:18.858 --> 14:20.961
AW, COME ON,

14:20.994 --> 14:22.129
COME ON.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.531
YEAH, YOU KNOW.

14:24.564 --> 14:27.267
EVERYBODY LIKES BABIES!

14:27.300 --> 14:29.469
SEE? I KNEW IT!
DAMN, HOW COULD I
BE SO BLIND?

14:29.502 --> 14:33.406
THE SIGNS WERE
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME
THE WHOLE TIME.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.319
OH...

14:46.353 --> 14:48.355

14:48.388 --> 14:50.223

14:56.596 --> 14:58.431
OH, MY!

14:58.465 --> 14:59.199
PFFFTT!

14:59.232 --> 15:01.601
ARE YOU ACCUSING ME
OF SOMETHING?

15:01.634 --> 15:04.137
I'M JUST SAYING
IF YOU DIDN'T WANT
A BABY,

15:04.171 --> 15:07.007
YOU COULD HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE MORE
CAREFUL.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.208
HA HA HA HA...

15:08.241 --> 15:12.512
YEAH, YOU WEREN'T
EXACTLY OUT OF TOWN
WHEN THIS HAPPENED.

15:13.146 --> 15:13.780
HEY, THERE.

15:13.813 --> 15:17.017
OH, BABY,
I WANT YOU SO BAD!

15:21.054 --> 15:22.289
DO HAVE A CONDOM?

15:22.322 --> 15:26.359
OH...WELL, IF I DO,
IT'S UNDER THE SEAT
AND OVER 14 YEARS OLD.

15:26.393 --> 15:29.262
WE'D BETTER
COOL IT, THEN.

15:29.296 --> 15:31.398
YEAH, I GUESS SO.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.600
OK.

15:46.013 --> 15:47.981
OH, GOD, WHAT
WERE YOU THINKING?

15:48.015 --> 15:49.416
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

15:49.449 --> 15:51.985
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
WEARING THAT DRESS...

15:52.019 --> 15:53.120
OH, COME ON.

15:53.153 --> 15:56.623
I WEAR SWEAT PANTS
AND A PARKA,
AND YOU'RE ALL OVER ME.

15:56.656 --> 16:00.260
SO I TRIED TO POP IT,
AND GUESS WHAT.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.495
I MADE IT A THOUSAND
TIMES WORSE.

16:02.529 --> 16:04.664
OK, SWEETIE,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:04.697 --> 16:06.666
WE'LL JUST GET YOU

AMUSES YOU!

16:16.476 --> 16:17.544
OH...

OH, MY GOD.
WE HAVE 2 TEENAGERS.

16:20.447 --> 16:21.214
YEAH.

16:21.248 --> 16:26.086
WAS I BORN
AT A PHIL COLLINS CONCERT?

16:28.155 --> 16:28.788
WHAT?

16:28.821 --> 16:29.989
I WAS, WASN'T I?

16:30.023 --> 16:32.459
NO, NO, THERE WERE--
THERE WERE A LOT OF
OTHER ACTS THERE.

16:32.492 --> 16:35.162
THERE WERE
THE THOMPSON TWINS--

16:41.068 --> 16:43.503
COME ON. IT WAS
THE MUSIC EVENT
OF THE DECADE.

16:43.536 --> 16:44.471
YOU WERE LUCKY

16:48.608 --> 16:49.476
EXCUSE ME?

16:49.509 --> 16:50.477

18:27.207 --> 18:30.777
OH, MY GOD!
IT'S DURAN DURAN!

18:32.279 --> 18:34.447
SIMON LeBON'S
SEEING ME NAKED.

18:34.481 --> 18:37.517
THIS ISN'T AT ALL
THE WAY I PICTURED IT.

18:37.550 --> 18:38.685
Stage manager:
COME ON, YOU'RE ON!

18:38.718 --> 18:41.588
ALL RIGHT, I GOT
AN EMERGENCY HERE.
CROSBY, STILLS, NASH--

18:41.621 --> 18:43.156
GET YOUR GUITARS,
GET ON STAGE!

18:43.190 --> 18:46.826
COME ON, COME ON,
GO, GO, GO, GO!

18:47.694 --> 18:48.395
GAAAH!

18:48.428 --> 18:50.297
HO-HOLD ON
FOR A SECOND, CLAUDIA.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.599
COULD YOU INTRODUCE ME
TO OZZY OSBOURNE?

18:52.632 --> 18:55.235
CAN THIS

18:55.268 --> 18:56.469
ALL RIGHT,
IF IT HAS TO.

18:56.503 --> 18:58.705
Sean: COME ON,
BABY, COME ON.
ONE MORE PUSH!

18:58.738 --> 19:00.673
COME ON, BABY!
COME ON!

19:00.707 --> 19:02.442
OK--AAAAAH!

19:02.475 --> 19:04.544
IT'S OUT, IT'S OUT.
IT'S A GIRL.

19:07.747 --> 19:10.583
COME ON,
CUT THE UMBILICAL CORD.
COME ON.

19:10.617 --> 19:15.188
GET OZZY TO DO IT.
HE'LL BITE IT.

19:15.455 --> 19:16.656
YOU PICKED MOM UP

19:16.689 --> 19:19.259
AND CARRIED HER
THROUGH A STADIUM
FULL OF SCREAMING IDIOTS?

19:19.292 --> 19:21.494
DRUNKEN,
SCREAMING IDIOTS.

19:21.528 --> 19:22.895
YOUR DAD
WAS MY HERO.

19:22.929 --> 19:25.732
SEE? EVEN JACKASSES
CAN RISE
TO THE OCCASION.

19:25.765 --> 19:28.601
THANKS, DAD.

19:30.470 --> 19:34.641
DID YOU, UH,
SAY SOMETHING ABOUT
A TATTOO PARLOR?

19:34.674 --> 19:36.276
[DOORBELL
RINGS]

19:36.309 --> 19:39.612
JIMMY, WHAT'S UP?
IS YOUR SISTER HERE?

19:39.646 --> 19:40.513
LILY!

19:40.547 --> 19:43.716
HEY, HOW DO YOU
GET RID OF
YOUR PIMPLES?

19:43.750 --> 19:46.253
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
I NEVER HAD ONE.

19:47.554 --> 19:49.789
GOD, I HATE YOU!

19:49.822 --> 19:51.358
DEAN.

19:51.391 --> 19:52.659
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
HERE?

19:52.692 --> 19:54.527
UH, BABY, LOOK,
I JUST CAME TO SAY

19:54.561 --> 19:56.629
THAT I'M SORRY
FOR HOW I ACTED
THE OTHER NIGHT,

19:56.663 --> 20:00.800
AND I THINK I FOUND
A WAY TO MAKE IT
UP TO YOU.

20:02.969 --> 20:06.439
OH, DEAN.
YEAH.

20:08.408 --> 20:09.776
THIS IS MAGIC MARKER.

20:09.809 --> 20:12.712
UH...DUDE RIPPED ME OFF!

20:12.745 --> 20:15.248
MY DAD CARRIED MY MOM
THROUGH A MOB

20:15.282 --> 20:17.617
SO THAT I COULD
BE DELIVERED
BY A RAPPER.

20:17.650 --> 20:18.818
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

20:18.851 --> 20:20.653
IT MEANS
YOU BETTER STEP UP,

20:20.687 --> 20:22.989
OR YOU'RE GONNA BE
ONE LONELY JACKASS.

20:23.022 --> 20:25.658
NOW GO
TO THE TATTOO PARLOR
AND GET YOUR DAMN YIN.

20:25.692 --> 20:28.728
CAN I JUST BUY YOU
SOMETHING?
NO!

20:30.630 --> 20:31.998
HEY, SEAN, GOOD NEWS.

20:32.031 --> 20:33.500
I'VE GOTTA PEE.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.768
I CAN TOP THAT.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.871
LET YOUR MOTHER GO FIRST.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.810
LISTEN, IF, UM...

20:43.843 --> 20:45.678
IF THIS IS
ANOTHER BABY,

20:45.712 --> 20:48.014
YOU'RE GONNA BE
OK WITH IT, RIGHT?

20:48.047 --> 20:49.248
OF COURSE.

20:49.282 --> 20:52.319
IF WE HAVE ANOTHER BABY,
I'M GONNA LOVE IT
WITH ALL MY HEART.

20:52.352 --> 20:54.053
AND IF WE DON'T,

20:54.086 --> 20:56.723
I'LL LOVE THAT, TOO.

20:58.391 --> 21:00.627
I LOVE YOU.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.063
NOW GO MAKE SOME PEE

21:04.096 --> 21:05.732
OK.

21:06.466 --> 21:09.436
OK, YOU'RE NOT ALL
OUT THERE WAITING
FOR ME, ARE YOU?

21:09.469 --> 21:11.070
BECAUSE IT REALLY
DOESN'T HELP ME GO

21:11.103 --> 21:12.972
IF I KNOW YOU'RE
ALL OUT THERE WAITING.

21:13.005 --> 21:16.543
IT'S JUST ME...
NO...

21:16.576 --> 21:17.777
Claudia: OH, MY GOD!

21:17.810 --> 21:19.278
WHAT?

21:20.513 --> 21:25.418
I DROPPED THE TEST
IN THE TOILET.
I'M GOING TO THE DRUGSTORE.

21:37.063 --> 21:38.831
RUN, I WISH THERE WAS
SOMETHING WE COULD DO
TO THANK YOU.

21:38.865 --> 21:41.334
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,
THERE REALLY IS.
ANYTHING.

21:41.368 --> 21:43.870
DID Y'ALL NAME
THIS BABY GIRL YET?

21:43.903 --> 21:44.737
NO.

21:44.771 --> 21:46.606
WE WERE KIND OF LEANING
TOWARD ELEANOR.

21:46.639 --> 21:50.443
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT LILY?

21:50.477 --> 21:52.779
THAT WAS MY DOG.

21:52.812 --> 21:55.782
SHE GOT HIT BY A CAR.

21:57.116 --> 21:59.519
I'M GONNA MISS THAT DOG.

21:59.552 --> 22:01.521
LILY'S
A BEAUTIFUL NAME.

22:01.554 --> 22:04.123
LILY'S GOOD.
YEAH, LILY'S GOOD.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.359
MY DOG.
