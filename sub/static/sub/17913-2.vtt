03:56.960 --> 03:58.800
Yes! I'm from Leipzig.

03:58.880 --> 04:01.280
A jewel of the East!

04:01.360 --> 04:02.920
Your German is very proficient.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.240
As a teenager
I spent many happy summers

04:05.320 --> 04:08.400
hill-walking in Bavaria
with my mother's family.

04:10.600 --> 04:12.640
Why do they think you're Danish?

04:12.720 --> 04:14.600
Do they?

04:32.720 --> 04:34.040
What is he saying?

08:17.720 --> 08:21.240
...and the rind of the cheese
was not edible after all!

09:47.760 --> 09:50.320
Could you tell him it was nice sex

09:50.400 --> 09:52.840
but I don't want any kind of relationship
including friendship.

09:52.920 --> 09:54.920
I was just trying to find
the toilet in the gallery.

09:55.000 --> 09:59.800
I was really desperate,
hopping up and down and he hugged me.

09:59.880 --> 10:03.440
It was weird, but he's cute.

10:03.520 --> 10:07.480
And then... somehow I am here!

10:08.080 --> 10:10.520
You want me to tell him that?

10:10.600 --> 10:13.800
I can't do this bad dancing all night.
I need a drink.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.600
You didn't tell him?

12:34.680 --> 12:37.960
Might have got lost in translation.

13:04.800 --> 13:05.800
What's that?

13:05.880 --> 13:07.720
He's proving hard to convince.

14:39.440 --> 14:40.960
What is your costume?

14:41.040 --> 14:42.400
The Terminator.

16:52.760 --> 16:55.160
Would you like to come
to my youth hostel?

16:55.240 --> 16:56.680
I fly home tomorrow.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.520
I think Dylan really did like you.
