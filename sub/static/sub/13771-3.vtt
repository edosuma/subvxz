Dewey, could you reach

00:07.268 --> 00:08.747
into my sock drawer
with your hand

00:08.834 --> 00:10.227
and get me a pair of socks?

00:10.314 --> 00:11.576
Okay.

00:13.230 --> 00:14.536
Not that one. On top.

00:16.190 --> 00:17.756
Not on top of the dresser!

00:17.843 --> 00:19.497
Right in front of you!
The sock drawer!

00:20.672 --> 00:22.935
That's your sock drawer!
Go next to it!

00:23.980 --> 00:26.156
On the other side!

00:26.243 --> 00:28.028
Not behind the dresser!

00:28.115 --> 00:31.031

is reach into my drawer and...

After two months
of unemployment,

01:15.771 --> 01:16.728
Mom went to Lucky Aide

01:16.815 --> 01:18.165
and begged
for her job back.

01:18.252 --> 01:19.688
They finally
let her come back

01:19.775 --> 01:21.211
as a probationary
employee.

01:21.298 --> 01:23.561
It just goes to show you,
Malcolm: If you want

01:23.648 --> 01:26.216
to wear the smock, you can't
be afraid to humble yourself.

01:26.303 --> 01:28.218
I had forgotten
how well this hangs.

01:28.305 --> 01:29.567
HAL: Honey? Ah!

01:29.654 --> 01:31.526
[chuckles]
I've got a surprise.

01:31.613 --> 01:33.136
Oh, we're running
late, Hal.

01:33.223 --> 01:34.224
I can't be late
while I'm still

01:34.311 --> 01:35.486
on probation
at the store.

01:35.573 --> 01:36.574
This is worth it.

01:40.491 --> 01:41.971
Ta-da!

01:42.972 --> 01:44.713
It's a cat habitat.

01:44.800 --> 01:45.931
You know how
you're always saying

01:46.018 --> 01:47.542
there's no reason for us
to get a cat?

01:47.629 --> 01:49.413
Well, now there is one!

01:49.500 --> 01:51.241
It's got a tetherball,
two main decks,

01:51.328 --> 01:52.808
an activity center,

01:52.895 --> 01:54.723
and a crow's nest
to look out for other cats.

01:54.810 --> 01:57.639
I call it Cat-man-do!

01:58.727 --> 02:01.730

is so great.

02:06.082 --> 02:07.997
You think
it's gonna snow?

02:08.084 --> 02:09.389
Don't be silly.

02:09.477 --> 02:11.043
It hasn't snowed
in a year and a half.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.306
That could change.

02:12.393 --> 02:14.003
We could have a snow day
any day now.

02:14.090 --> 02:16.658
I deserve a snow day.

02:16.745 --> 02:18.964
The whole neighborhood's going
to see this thing in our trash

02:19.051 --> 02:21.184
and know your mother is nuts.

02:21.271 --> 02:22.533
It's awfully big.

02:22.620 --> 02:24.535
You think the trash man's
gonna take this?

02:24.622 --> 02:26.233
Oh, he'll take it.

02:26.320 --> 02:29.540
That's why I'm leaving him
a six-pack.

02:29.627 --> 02:34.371
You're the only thing
I've ever been proud of.

02:34.458 --> 02:35.764
Come on, Dewey.

02:39.463 --> 02:40.812
Didn't you used
to work here

02:40.899 --> 02:41.900
a couple of months ago?

02:41.987 --> 02:43.554
Oh, yeah.

02:43.641 --> 02:45.339
I practically ran this place
for about 12 years.

02:45.426 --> 02:46.514
In fact, I think I still
hold the record...

02:46.601 --> 02:49.473
Lois! Mr. Kushell said

02:49.560 --> 02:52.302
probationary employees
have to wear the pin.

02:54.870 --> 02:57.177
So big.

02:57.264 --> 02:59.396
I've been on probation
lots of times, Lois.

02:59.483 --> 03:01.442
You can choose not
to feel humiliated.

03:01.529 --> 03:02.834
They're just trying
to break your spirit

03:02.921 --> 03:04.184
with the pin
and the drug tests

03:04.271 --> 03:05.968
and those draconian
hygiene checks.

03:06.055 --> 03:07.404
I suggest, for
the next two weeks,

03:07.491 --> 03:09.319
you wash your hands
after using the bathroom

03:09.406 --> 03:10.755
just in case.

03:10.842 --> 03:12.366
Oh, by the way,
they changed the codes.

03:12.453 --> 03:15.499
The women's room
isn't 456892;

03:15.586 --> 03:17.588
it's 630385.

Oh, and if you ever
need the men's,

03:19.068 --> 03:23.551

it's 459929.

I'm sure you're good
at lots of things.

03:56.148 --> 03:58.020
What is this?

03:58.107 --> 03:59.630
It's the new ad campaign
for Smoooth Malt Liquor.

03:59.717 --> 04:01.632
You don't find
this offensive?

04:01.719 --> 04:02.851
What?

04:02.938 --> 04:04.635
It's a black janitor
with a mop

04:04.722 --> 04:07.551
and a six-pack
of malt liquor in his hand.

04:07.638 --> 04:09.118
I don't know
that he's a janitor.

04:09.205 --> 04:10.380
Maybe he just
spilled something.

04:12.513 --> 04:14.036
His name is Slappy?

04:14.123 --> 04:15.951
A delightful throwback
to a simpler time.

04:16.038 --> 04:18.127
Well, I'm getting
rid of it.

04:18.214 --> 04:20.825
If you get caught,
I don't know about this!

04:20.911 --> 04:23.524
And I would have loved to have
been called Slappy growing up!

04:25.743 --> 04:27.658
The trash man
didn't take it?

04:27.745 --> 04:29.138
Nope.

04:29.225 --> 04:30.270
Where's the beer?

04:30.357 --> 04:31.923
Oh, he took that.

04:32.010 --> 04:34.186
He drank one and poured
the rest into his thermos.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.450
And he left this here
to mock me.

04:36.537 --> 04:37.886
Maybe we can chop it up.

04:37.973 --> 04:39.148
No, Dewey.

04:39.235 --> 04:40.410
We are not
accommodating him.

04:40.497 --> 04:41.933
I did not pour
my heart and soul

04:42.020 --> 04:44.153
into this thing
so that the trash man

04:44.240 --> 04:45.850
could refuse
to take it away!

04:45.937 --> 04:47.461
There are principles
that need to...

04:47.548 --> 04:49.506
-Ooh, get out of here!
-[cats meowing]

04:51.247 --> 04:54.206
This society is
falling to pieces.

05:01.431 --> 05:03.955
-What are you doing?
-We had to replace

05:04.042 --> 05:05.130
the one that was stolen
last week.

05:05.217 --> 05:06.262
I think Craig took it

05:06.349 --> 05:07.611
so he can use
the carpool lane.

05:07.698 --> 05:09.134
Craig didn't take it.

05:09.221 --> 05:10.962
I took it and put it
in the trunk of my car.

05:11.049 --> 05:12.486
Mom, what
are you doing?

05:12.573 --> 05:13.922
You're on probation.

05:14.009 --> 05:15.750
This is completely
racially insensitive.

05:15.837 --> 05:17.273
It has no place in this store.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.449
But Mr. Kushell told
me to put it up.

05:22.234 --> 05:23.758
Well, I'm telling you
to take it down.

05:23.845 --> 05:25.586
I can't do that.

05:25.673 --> 05:26.717
You're not
my boss here.

05:26.804 --> 05:28.066
Mr. Kushell is.

05:28.153 --> 05:29.807
Mr. Kushell didn't
tear three inches

05:29.894 --> 05:31.853
getting you out of him.

05:31.940 --> 05:33.811
Now, are you going
to take this down or not?

05:35.813 --> 05:37.032
No.

05:43.473 --> 05:45.562
She isn't coming after me,
is she?

05:48.173 --> 05:51.351
Excuse me!
Excuse me!

05:52.830 --> 05:54.310
-Yeah?
-I don't know if you remember.

05:54.397 --> 05:56.530
I put this cat habitat
out last week...

05:56.617 --> 05:58.053
Yeah, I can't take that.
It's too big.

05:58.140 --> 06:00.708
But you took the
six-pack I left you.

06:00.795 --> 06:03.580
You must have known it
was an advance "thank you."

06:03.667 --> 06:06.409
Actually, I thought
it was an overdue apology.

06:06.496 --> 06:07.889
Apology?

06:07.976 --> 06:09.978
Why would this family
give you an apology?

06:10.065 --> 06:11.501
Because you people are pigs.

06:11.588 --> 06:14.417
You don't even use half
the stuff you throw out.

06:14.504 --> 06:15.940
And, nine months
after your wife leaves

06:16.027 --> 06:17.899
three birth control
pills in the pack,

06:17.986 --> 06:20.205
here come the disposable
diapers again.

06:20.292 --> 06:22.338
Talk about
screwed-up priorities.

06:22.425 --> 06:24.253
And you guys buy
those generic diapers

06:24.340 --> 06:26.081
that break apart in the can,

06:26.168 --> 06:28.562
yet I notice someone can afford
a Toblerone every Friday.

06:28.649 --> 06:29.693
Hey, buddy,
this family's trash

06:29.780 --> 06:31.173
is none
of your business!

06:32.566 --> 06:34.263
You know what?
Let's start again.

06:34.350 --> 06:36.918
There... there's no reason
we can't be civil, hmm?

06:37.005 --> 06:38.267
You have a hard job.

06:38.354 --> 06:39.834
It's a job I respect.

06:39.921 --> 06:41.357
Hey, Oscar...

06:41.444 --> 06:42.793
here's your lunch.

06:49.713 --> 06:51.759
Awful high and mighty

What's that?

07:10.604 --> 07:12.693
-Hmm?
-I threw that picture away!

07:12.780 --> 07:13.911
Oh, we still
had the negative.

07:13.998 --> 07:15.391
It reminds me
of the old you,

07:15.478 --> 07:16.784
back when you still
knew right from wrong.

07:16.871 --> 07:18.133
Just because I'm not doing
what you want

07:18.220 --> 07:19.700
doesn't mean you get
to humiliate me!

07:19.787 --> 07:21.571
Humiliate you?

07:21.658 --> 07:23.878
You mean there's an offensive
image on display in the store?

07:23.965 --> 07:25.793

to love to play dress-up

07:25.880 --> 07:27.272

Give him a call.

07:31.146 --> 07:33.017
Take that down!

07:33.104 --> 07:34.845
Gee, I'm not doing
what you want.

07:34.932 --> 07:36.673
You're not doing what I want.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.501
Maybe we should bring
Mr. Kushell into this,

07:38.588 --> 07:39.937
since he's the only one

07:40.024 --> 07:41.678
whose opinion
you seem to care about.

07:43.027 --> 07:44.638
"No employee may display
personal items

07:44.725 --> 07:46.466

07:46.553 --> 07:47.858
Don't worry, Mom.

07:47.945 --> 07:49.469
It only added a day
to your probation.

07:52.036 --> 07:53.429
I'm sorry, God.

07:53.516 --> 07:56.693
You're against the rules here.

I don't know who I am anymore.

08:22.327 --> 08:24.765
Now, that's the name
of that tune.

08:34.339 --> 08:37.604
I have to admit
I didn't see this coming.

08:45.437 --> 08:46.787
[seagulls squealing]

08:46.874 --> 08:48.745
Well, the Sanitation
Department claims

08:48.832 --> 08:51.269
that our trash man has an
airtight alibi for last night.

08:51.356 --> 08:53.097
If I want to haul
this stuff away myself,

08:53.184 --> 08:56.013
I need $1,200
for a 19-ton truck

08:56.100 --> 08:57.711
and a Class 5
sanitation license,

08:57.798 --> 08:59.974
which I'm pretty
sure I don't have.

09:02.237 --> 09:04.369
Honey, I don't want you
to worry about this.

09:04.456 --> 09:06.197
I will get rid
of this crud

long it takes.

that's okay?

Honey, I am not gonna tell
you that this is ideal,

09:16.294 --> 09:18.470
but if we refuse
to fight this fight,

09:18.558 --> 09:20.472
then we're really
living in garbage.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.909
Garbage
of the spirit.

09:21.996 --> 09:23.345
And that's got to
be the worst kind.

for our neighbors

09:25.956 --> 09:27.610
with no garbage
on their lawns.

to sound too superior.

are things I don't say!

tape the cracks, and spray?

you get used to it.

of trash we're living in

10:56.351 --> 10:58.048
over who gets to eat
the rats' fecal matter,

10:58.135 --> 11:00.137
and then you're going to hear
some complaining from me.

11:00.224 --> 11:01.399
[sniffing]

11:01.486 --> 11:03.184
I think we've got
a leak in here.

11:03.271 --> 11:04.968
Reese, check the windows.

11:05.055 --> 11:06.578
[grunting]

11:06.666 --> 11:08.798
[exhales, panting]

11:08.885 --> 11:10.713
-I didn't think I'd make it.
-On the table.

11:13.194 --> 11:15.718
[inhales deeply]
Ahh...

11:15.805 --> 11:16.980
Hi, Craig.
Ready to go.

11:17.067 --> 11:18.329
Craig's driving you?

11:18.416 --> 11:19.504
Yeah. You
can take the car.

11:19.591 --> 11:20.897
But we could just go together.

11:20.984 --> 11:22.203
Could we? Hah!

11:22.290 --> 11:23.552
You've been
so intent on acting

11:23.639 --> 11:25.249
like we weren't
in the same family.

11:25.336 --> 11:26.947
No, that's not
what I've been doing.

11:27.034 --> 11:28.775
I'm just mature enough
to draw a distinction

11:28.862 --> 11:31.865
between what goes on at home
and what we have to do at work.

11:31.952 --> 11:33.954
Oh, I see. So it's okay
to sell out your principles

11:34.041 --> 11:35.520
as long as you're
doing it for money.

11:35.607 --> 11:36.870
Yes, Mom. Big money!

11:36.957 --> 11:38.741
I've thrown away all morality

11:38.828 --> 11:40.525
and agreed to go to hell
for $6.25 an hour.

11:40.612 --> 11:42.876
You know that sign
is a bigoted image, Malcolm!

11:42.963 --> 11:43.920
It's not that bad!

11:44.007 --> 11:44.921
It's a picture
of a man

11:45.008 --> 11:46.357
with a mop and a beer.

11:46.444 --> 11:48.316
People who mop drink beer.

11:48.403 --> 11:50.448
People who drink beer mop.

11:50.535 --> 11:52.494
Oh, Slappy?
That thing's amazing.

11:52.581 --> 11:54.583
He's tripled our
Smoooth Malt Liquor sales.

11:54.670 --> 11:56.280
I can't believe
I've raised a son

11:56.367 --> 11:58.892
who is so insensitive
to things that really matter.

11:58.979 --> 12:01.590
If I'm insensitive,
I got that way by watching you!

12:01.677 --> 12:02.722
Both of you, stop it!

12:02.809 --> 12:04.680
You're making this place
unlivable!

12:04.767 --> 12:06.638
[tape ripping]

12:06.726 --> 12:08.118
Let's go, Craig.

12:11.078 --> 12:12.949
I think it's nice
when someone does

12:13.036 --> 12:15.212
a little something extra
for poker night.

12:15.299 --> 12:18.041
I mean, a six-ton pile of trash?

12:18.128 --> 12:20.217
You really know how
to make a guy feel special.

12:20.304 --> 12:21.741
You know, I think
the smell around here

12:21.828 --> 12:23.830
actually makes Hal's dip
taste good.

12:23.917 --> 12:24.961
[laughter]

12:25.048 --> 12:26.310
Man, who dealt me this hand?

12:26.397 --> 12:27.834
I'm going to throw it out
on the front yard.

12:27.921 --> 12:29.836
-[laughter]
-Come on, guys,

12:29.923 --> 12:31.359
I really don't know
what I'm going to do.

12:31.446 --> 12:33.491
If I give up now, I mean,
what kind of example

12:33.578 --> 12:35.102
does that set for my boys?

12:35.189 --> 12:36.451
Yeah, that's a tough one, Hal.

12:36.538 --> 12:39.497
A man keeps chipping away
at his authority,

12:39.584 --> 12:40.672
the next thing you know,
he's not the king

12:40.760 --> 12:42.370
of his own
massive pile of garbage.

12:42.457 --> 12:44.981
[laughter]

12:45.068 --> 12:46.896
ABE: Come on, guys,
Hal's suffering.

12:46.983 --> 12:48.593
We really should be
more sensitive.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.073
No, wait-- I got one.

12:50.160 --> 12:51.466
I see my favorite band
out there--

12:51.553 --> 12:53.163
A Flock of Seagulls.

12:53.250 --> 12:55.078
[laughter]

12:56.514 --> 12:58.168
Oh! Damn.

12:58.255 --> 13:02.346
If anyone looks at my cards,
I'll be able to tell.

13:02.433 --> 13:03.478
MAN: He can't tell.

13:03.565 --> 13:05.828
[overlapping chatter]

13:13.183 --> 13:14.663
What the hell
are you doing?

13:14.750 --> 13:16.752
I just thought
I'd show this to the guys.

13:16.839 --> 13:18.972
You can explain
why you've been fighting

13:19.059 --> 13:20.800
to keep this up at the store.

13:22.453 --> 13:23.628
I wasn't fighting
for it.

13:23.715 --> 13:25.456
I was just told
to put it up by my boss.

13:25.543 --> 13:26.936
You also added,
very vehemently,

13:27.023 --> 13:29.199
that, "It's not so bad."

13:29.286 --> 13:31.158
Maybe you can explain
to everyone here

13:31.245 --> 13:32.812
why this isn't racist.

13:37.555 --> 13:39.166
First we pick
their cotton,

13:39.253 --> 13:42.125
then we have to solve
their moral dilemmas for them.

13:42.212 --> 13:43.561
It's probably
the saddest sight

13:43.648 --> 13:46.521
of all when racism
impacts on white people.

13:46.608 --> 13:49.916
How many white mothers and sons
must be torn asunder

13:50.003 --> 13:51.526
before we learn our lesson?

13:51.613 --> 13:52.962
TREY: It's bad enough
we have to watch them

13:53.049 --> 13:54.529
-dance at weddings.
-[laughter]

13:54.616 --> 13:56.444
Shaking their
flat asses around.

13:56.531 --> 13:58.663
-Whoo... Ooh yeah!
-[laughter]

13:58.750 --> 14:00.274
Will you stop it?!

14:00.361 --> 14:01.753
I need your help.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.060
This is a completely
offensive, false image

14:04.147 --> 14:05.845
of African American men.

14:07.498 --> 14:09.674
[laughter]

14:13.461 --> 14:15.202
You know what's
really bothering you?

14:15.289 --> 14:16.812
You don't think
I'm prejudiced.

14:16.899 --> 14:17.944
You're just mad
that, at work,

14:18.031 --> 14:19.032
I don't have to obey you.

14:19.119 --> 14:20.207
And now that I'm

14:20.294 --> 14:21.643
getting older,
you're losing

14:21.730 --> 14:23.166
more and more control
over me every day.

14:23.253 --> 14:25.081
You can't stand
that soon I'll be free.

14:25.168 --> 14:26.387
He has a dream.

14:26.474 --> 14:27.562
Sing it, my brother!

14:27.649 --> 14:28.737
Should we talk about

14:28.824 --> 14:30.130
what's really
bothering you?

14:30.217 --> 14:31.914
It's that you
know I'm right!

14:32.001 --> 14:34.612
You do have
a code of ethics

14:34.699 --> 14:35.657
that you're
trying to deny.

14:35.744 --> 14:37.224
What do you know
about ethics?!

14:37.311 --> 14:38.660
Bringing this in here
to embarrass me

14:38.747 --> 14:40.183
in front of Dad's friends?

14:40.270 --> 14:42.011
Did I tell Dad how you said
sooner or later

14:42.098 --> 14:43.752
he'll realize
he looks ridiculous

14:43.839 --> 14:45.841
and quit this stupid fight
with the trash man?

14:45.928 --> 14:48.583
Did I? No! Because,
no matter how mad I get,

14:48.670 --> 14:50.977
I always treat you
with some level of decency!

14:51.064 --> 14:53.414
I'll "realize
I look ridiculous"?

14:53.501 --> 14:55.503
Hal, that's
not the point!

14:55.590 --> 14:56.896
Stop this! Just stop!

14:56.983 --> 14:59.159
What do we need
to fight for?

14:59.246 --> 15:00.595
It's a nice night.

15:00.682 --> 15:02.902
We came here to play cards.

15:02.989 --> 15:05.687
Can we just play cards?

15:05.774 --> 15:06.906
Why? What have you got?

15:06.993 --> 15:08.211
Nothing.

15:08.298 --> 15:10.213
-I'm out.
-I fold.

15:19.048 --> 15:21.050
DEWEY:
Dad?

15:21.137 --> 15:22.965
Dewey?

15:23.052 --> 15:24.749
DEWEY:
Dad?

15:24.836 --> 15:26.490
Dewey?

15:26.577 --> 15:27.839
Dewey, where are you?

15:27.927 --> 15:29.102
I don't know.

15:29.189 --> 15:30.712
My garbage fort
collapsed.

15:30.799 --> 15:31.800
Can you breathe?

15:31.887 --> 15:34.281
Yes, but
I don't want to.

15:34.368 --> 15:36.500
Just keep digging
until you reach daylight.

15:42.724 --> 15:45.770
Hey. Got your note.

15:45.857 --> 15:48.164
I need some help with this.
I am in over my head.

15:48.251 --> 15:49.687
You did the right
thing coming to me.

15:49.774 --> 15:51.298
Your mother
can never know.

15:51.385 --> 15:52.908
-That's not a problem.
-Okay.

15:52.995 --> 15:55.519
There's a way to solve
this little trash dilemma.

15:55.606 --> 15:57.957
But I need to know
that you'll go all the way.

15:58.044 --> 15:59.654
You have to want it bad.

15:59.741 --> 16:02.352
The fact that I came to you
should prove how desperate I am.

16:02.439 --> 16:03.658
Good enough.

16:03.745 --> 16:05.877
From here, there's
no turning back.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.315
We can implement
my plan tonight.

16:08.402 --> 16:11.144
Meet me back here
at exactly 6:00.

16:11.231 --> 16:13.189
That's in 20 minutes.

16:13.276 --> 16:14.451
You want to go now?

16:14.538 --> 16:16.105
Okay.

16:17.715 --> 16:18.803
HAL:
It's not stealing.

16:18.890 --> 16:20.109
It's just borrowing.

16:20.196 --> 16:21.937
Not stealing, just borrowing.

16:22.024 --> 16:23.112
First, we pick up

16:23.199 --> 16:24.374
all the trash
from our lawn.

16:24.461 --> 16:25.506
Then we top it off
with a little

16:25.593 --> 16:26.811
medical waste,

16:26.898 --> 16:28.988
and we pay a visit
to a certain garbageman.

16:29.075 --> 16:30.293
And those guard dogs
will be okay?

16:30.380 --> 16:31.686
They'll wake up
in half an hour.

16:31.773 --> 16:33.862
They may have a slight headache.

16:33.949 --> 16:37.170
Son, if you could just apply
this kind of focus

16:37.257 --> 16:39.346
and determination
to your schoolwork...

16:39.433 --> 16:41.739
Oh, that ship has sailed.

16:52.533 --> 16:54.796
Only six more hours till
that pin comes off.

16:54.883 --> 16:57.364
The last six hours
of probation are what I call

16:57.451 --> 16:58.930
the Danger Zone.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.629
Your eyes are so focused
on the finish line,

17:01.716 --> 17:03.152
you don't even realize
your hands

17:03.239 --> 17:05.154
are stuffing your pockets
full of trail mix.

17:05.241 --> 17:06.460
Damn it, Craig.

17:06.547 --> 17:07.765
Do you believe
in right and wrong?

17:07.852 --> 17:09.202
I'm not sure I follow.

17:09.289 --> 17:11.117
Let's just say there's
something you have to do,

17:11.204 --> 17:13.118
and you've been hoping
someone else would do it,

17:13.205 --> 17:14.250
but you've
gradually realized

17:14.337 --> 17:15.904
you have
to do it yourself,

17:15.991 --> 17:18.037
even if it
breaks the rules.

17:18.124 --> 17:19.951
Dear God, I thought I'd

17:20.039 --> 17:22.214
-lost my chance years ago.
-Huh?

17:22.301 --> 17:23.520
Let's just get
in the car and drive.

17:23.607 --> 17:24.868
You don't have to pack.

17:24.955 --> 17:26.088
I have clothes for you
in the trunk.

17:26.175 --> 17:27.959
Oh, for the love of God.

17:33.965 --> 17:36.098
Thank the Lord you're
getting rid of that thing.

17:36.185 --> 17:37.447
Shirley, I had to.

17:37.534 --> 17:38.709
I just couldn't
stand it any longer.

17:38.796 --> 17:39.971
Oh, believe me, I know.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.712
Ever since
that thing went up,

17:41.799 --> 17:44.846
I swear we've had so many
more black people in here.

17:44.933 --> 17:46.369
What?

17:46.456 --> 17:47.936
That is not our clientele.

17:48.023 --> 17:49.590
We just don't have
the personnel

17:49.677 --> 17:50.939
to follow them around.

17:51.026 --> 17:52.245
Thank you, Lois.

18:03.430 --> 18:04.648
What are you doing?

18:04.735 --> 18:06.998
-I'm putting this back.
-Really?

18:07.086 --> 18:09.218
You know I've always believed
in admitting when I was wrong.

18:09.305 --> 18:12.221
There were things about this
that I hadn't considered.

18:12.308 --> 18:15.268
Maybe I was too focused
on controlling you.

18:15.355 --> 18:17.400
The point is,
I want this to stay.

18:17.487 --> 18:19.272
This has to stay.

18:24.581 --> 18:25.887
Wow!

18:25.974 --> 18:27.889
Now all I want
to do is take it down.

18:27.976 --> 18:29.760
I mean,
look at this thing.

18:29.847 --> 18:31.066
It's horribly offensive.

18:31.153 --> 18:32.676
What year
are we living in?

18:32.763 --> 18:34.765
His name is Slappy,
for God sakes.

18:38.987 --> 18:40.380
But, if I take it down now,

18:40.467 --> 18:41.990
she'll think I'm only
doing it to be contrary.

18:42.077 --> 18:45.646
Am I only doing it
to be contrary? No.

18:45.733 --> 18:47.561
I really am offended by this.
These are my true feelings,

18:47.648 --> 18:49.606
which I wasn't able
to have before

18:49.693 --> 18:52.087
because
I was only being contrary.

18:52.174 --> 18:54.568
Unless it's
the opposite of that.

18:56.265 --> 18:57.701
Okay, I am definitely
taking this down

18:57.788 --> 18:59.486
while I'm walking away
and leaving it here

18:59.573 --> 19:01.705
while I pretend to do nothing
and figure out what to do.

19:01.792 --> 19:02.924
[whimpers]

19:06.275 --> 19:07.581
[grunting]

19:10.192 --> 19:11.846
[hoarse whisper]
Okay, go ahead.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.159
Reese, what are
you doing?! Come on!

19:27.253 --> 19:29.820
Dad, I followed a possum
that led me out.

19:29.907 --> 19:32.127
Dewey, not now. This is
Daddy's time with Reese.

19:37.567 --> 19:39.221
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

19:39.308 --> 19:41.702
Dewey, I don't need you
talking sense to me right now!

19:43.834 --> 19:45.880
Reese, quit screwing around!

19:48.187 --> 19:49.188
[shrieks]

20:01.809 --> 20:03.506
Ohh!

20:03.593 --> 20:06.117
[whimpering]

20:12.036 --> 20:13.212
[screaming]

20:14.865 --> 20:17.390
[crash, car alarm blaring]

20:21.176 --> 20:22.960
[screams, whimpers]

20:24.788 --> 20:26.355
What good
is running gonna do?!

20:26.442 --> 20:27.704
We live here!

20:27.791 --> 20:30.316
HAL:
Nice try, little boy!

20:33.014 --> 20:35.843
If I leave it up,
Mom gets what she wants.

20:35.930 --> 20:36.931
If I take it down,

20:37.018 --> 20:38.019
Mom still has
her hooks in me,

20:38.106 --> 20:39.586
which is what
she really wants.

20:39.673 --> 20:42.197
No matter what I decide...

20:42.284 --> 20:43.590
Wait a minute.

20:43.677 --> 20:45.069
I don't have
to decide.

20:45.156 --> 20:46.854
I can leave it
to chance.

20:46.941 --> 20:48.986
Heads, I take it down.

20:49.073 --> 20:50.553
Tails, I'll leave it up.

20:50.640 --> 20:53.208
I'm not listening
to my mom anymore.

20:53.295 --> 20:55.689
From now on,
I'm listening to you.

21:03.566 --> 21:04.959
[gasps]

21:05.046 --> 21:07.048
[opera music playing]

21:07.135 --> 21:08.745
I'm so glad you
liked the filet.

21:08.832 --> 21:11.357
It really brings out
the finish in the wine.

21:11.444 --> 21:14.708
So, we'll be taking away
three bags today?

21:14.795 --> 21:15.926
Two. Of course, two.
