01:50.742 --> 01:55.537
Yo, yo, check out what this
girl DM'ed me on Twitter.

01:55.539 --> 01:58.540
- Oh.
- Hot, right?

01:58.542 --> 02:00.126
Oh, yeah, she's, uh,

02:00.128 --> 02:02.879
not leaving anything
to the imagination.

02:02.881 --> 02:05.590
You must get these
from time to time, yeah?

02:05.592 --> 02:09.095
Yeah, lots and lots.

02:11.306 --> 02:13.598
How many followers you have?

02:13.600 --> 02:18.227
43,978.

02:18.229 --> 02:20.273
79.

02:20.981 --> 02:23.816
You probably got a bunch
after all these years, I bet.

02:23.818 --> 02:26.443
Yeah, yeah,
it's... it's up there.

02:26.445 --> 02:29.237
I lost count though.

02:29.239 --> 02:30.990
Oh, you could just check
real quick on your phone.

02:30.992 --> 02:32.658
Nah, it's cool.
I'll check later.

02:32.660 --> 02:33.742
No, it's easy.
All you got to do is...

02:33.744 --> 02:36.871
Later, Alex, later.

02:40.584 --> 02:43.171
So September 1st?

02:45.005 --> 02:46.838
- That's the date, right?
- Yeah.

02:46.840 --> 02:50.550
For five or six lucky souls,
that's the date.

02:50.552 --> 02:53.013
Do you know who's
getting called up?

02:54.849 --> 02:57.516
Why would I know that?

02:57.518 --> 02:58.850
You've been in
the club the longest.

02:58.852 --> 03:01.229
Figure if anyone would know,
you would.

03:01.231 --> 03:03.316
Well, I don't.

03:06.986 --> 03:08.443
Do you think I got a shot?

03:08.445 --> 03:10.570
Shit, if she's sending
you pictures like that,

03:10.572 --> 03:11.989
she's pretty much
begging for it.

03:11.991 --> 03:14.869
No, at...
at getting called up.

03:17.539 --> 03:18.746
I don't have
a good track record

03:18.748 --> 03:21.626
at predicting these things.

03:24.254 --> 03:26.045
Got a dip?

04:16.096 --> 04:18.096
You don't have to
pretend to be asleep.

04:18.098 --> 04:20.516
Pretend?
I'm not pretending.

04:20.517 --> 04:22.643
It's fine.
I'm leaving.

04:22.645 --> 04:24.103
Who asked you to leave?

04:24.105 --> 04:27.189
You are, right now.

04:27.191 --> 04:28.357
You're not facing me.

04:28.359 --> 04:30.904
I'm not facing you
'cause I was sleeping.

04:35.574 --> 04:38.367
Em.

04:38.369 --> 04:39.703
Hey.

04:41.288 --> 04:43.206
I don't know what
you want from me.

04:43.208 --> 04:45.290
- I want you to turn over.
- I turned over.

04:45.292 --> 04:49.711
- Yeah, not genuinely.
- I didn't turn over genuinely?

04:49.713 --> 04:52.214
Come on, what are
we talking about here?

04:52.216 --> 04:54.634
You know, every night
you're not on the road,

04:54.636 --> 04:57.093
you call me over;
we have sex;

04:57.095 --> 04:58.678
I get dressed while
you pretend to sleep;

04:58.680 --> 04:59.805
and then I leave.

04:59.807 --> 05:01.973
And it's not a big deal...

05:01.975 --> 05:03.643
It sounds like
it's a big deal.

05:03.645 --> 05:05.144
Of course it's a big deal.

05:05.146 --> 05:06.728
You know, anytime someone says,
"It's not a big deal,"

05:06.730 --> 05:07.855
they really mean it is,
otherwise

05:07.857 --> 05:09.398
they wouldn't bring it up.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.442
So, what is it that
you're bringing up, then?

05:11.444 --> 05:14.819
That this isn't fun anymore?

05:14.821 --> 05:16.488
You know,
the first three months,

05:16.490 --> 05:18.699
sure, that was fun, but

05:18.701 --> 05:19.867
the last three?

05:19.869 --> 05:22.160
It's pathetic.

05:22.162 --> 05:24.329
You know this is my career.

05:24.331 --> 05:27.208
I can't help that
I'm constantly on the road.

05:27.210 --> 05:29.668
I... I could get called up at
any minute. I have to be ready.

05:29.670 --> 05:32.213
You've been saying that
since the first day I met you.

05:32.215 --> 05:34.757
- And it's true.
- Maybe it is.

05:34.759 --> 05:38.718
But you've been at this
for 12 years already?

05:38.720 --> 05:41.264
It's not an easy business.

05:46.062 --> 05:48.146
It should be
a little bit easier than this.

05:54.403 --> 05:55.903
Good, good.

05:55.905 --> 05:57.988
The only thing I'd say is,

05:57.990 --> 06:00.658
on this one,
when you're coming through,

06:00.660 --> 06:02.701
palm up, palm down, remember?

06:02.703 --> 06:05.081
All right, go for it.

06:05.665 --> 06:07.208
Nice.

06:08.333 --> 06:11.379
- 80, right?
- Right, thank you.

06:13.131 --> 06:14.463
Jake's getting a lot better.

06:14.465 --> 06:17.048
- He loves working with you.
- Yeah.

06:17.050 --> 06:18.800
Tonight's the last game
of the season, right?

06:18.802 --> 06:20.011
Right, right.

06:20.013 --> 06:21.303
You guys gonna be able
to make it?

06:21.305 --> 06:22.805
I wish we could,
but Steve and I

06:22.807 --> 06:24.223
have our first PTA
meeting of the year,

06:24.225 --> 06:25.850
- Okay.
- But before you know it,

06:25.852 --> 06:28.728
we'll be back watching you
again in the spring.

06:28.730 --> 06:31.396
Right.
Right, in the spring.

06:31.398 --> 06:34.065
- Well, good luck tonight.
- Thanks.

06:34.067 --> 06:35.233
Back seat, buddy.

06:35.235 --> 06:37.569
- No!
- Yes, you know.

06:37.571 --> 06:38.905
- Mom...
- Come on.

07:06.975 --> 07:08.684
If Dwarn pats you
on the shoulder

07:08.686 --> 07:12.941
to head into Skip's office,
it means you're going up.

07:17.444 --> 07:20.071
Good for Colsey.

07:20.073 --> 07:22.408
Yeah, good for him.

07:45.514 --> 07:48.348
Alex, Skip wants to see you.

07:48.350 --> 07:51.144
Thanks.

07:52.312 --> 07:54.481
It'll come.

07:57.610 --> 08:00.069
Dustin.

08:00.071 --> 08:03.408
Alex comes out, you're up.

08:28.891 --> 08:31.475
I just... I wanted to say,
thank you for e...

08:31.477 --> 08:33.351
Dustin.

08:33.352 --> 08:35.104
You've given
the organization,

08:35.106 --> 08:36.980
what, 12 years now?

08:36.982 --> 08:38.523
Yep, yep.

08:38.525 --> 08:41.318
Like you said, I just had to
keep at it and keep believing.

08:41.320 --> 08:42.903
So you know
better than anybody

08:42.905 --> 08:46.034
this is a game of statistics.

08:49.286 --> 08:52.413
Man, I lobbied for you.
It's...

08:52.415 --> 08:54.831
It's not your defense
they're worried about.

08:54.833 --> 08:57.543
You're a good catcher.
It's...

08:57.545 --> 09:02.257
Your batting average just
isn't where it needs to be.

09:03.550 --> 09:05.801
I wanted you
to hear it from me.

09:05.803 --> 09:06.927
You deserve that.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.556
There's always next year.

09:17.106 --> 09:20.607
- There he is.
- It's about time!

10:16.207 --> 10:20.793
Aw, Dusty.
Oh, I'm so sorry.

10:20.795 --> 10:24.381
Well, maybe next year, right?

10:26.925 --> 10:28.301
Ma, are you there?

10:28.303 --> 10:30.219
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

10:30.221 --> 10:33.471
I just said,
"Maybe next year."

10:33.473 --> 10:36.558
Dustin, we talked about this.

10:36.560 --> 10:39.812
You said you'd give it
till you're 30.

10:39.814 --> 10:43.773
I don't recall ever
specifying the beginning of 30.

10:43.775 --> 10:47.653
You turn 30 next week.

10:47.655 --> 10:51.823
And do what, Ma?
I've never had a backup plan.

10:51.825 --> 10:53.868
Why don't you come home?

10:53.870 --> 10:56.162
Home?
What's in Brampton?

10:56.164 --> 10:59.331
Me, your sister,
your friends.

10:59.333 --> 11:00.999
My friends I haven't
seen or spoken to

11:01.001 --> 11:03.501
in over a decade, Mom.

11:06.506 --> 11:10.051
Well, but maybe this
is exactly what you need,

11:10.053 --> 11:12.302
You know, a chance to regroup

11:12.304 --> 11:16.014
and figure out your next steps.

11:23.190 --> 11:24.856
You must have
given some thought

11:24.858 --> 11:28.153
into life after baseball.

11:54.555 --> 11:56.847
So good to
have you home, honey.

11:56.849 --> 12:00.684
Oh, your sister and Allyson are
coming to dinner tonight too.

12:00.686 --> 12:03.354
So have you let your friends
know that you're back home?

12:03.356 --> 12:06.816
No, I told you, I haven't
talked to them in a long time.

12:06.818 --> 12:11.028
- What about Rachel?
- What about her?

12:11.030 --> 12:13.572
- Have you spoken to her?
- No.

12:13.574 --> 12:15.240
Oh.

12:15.242 --> 12:17.659
"Oh" what?

12:17.661 --> 12:18.870
Nothing.

12:18.872 --> 12:21.663
Sorry, I just... I didn't know

12:21.665 --> 12:23.707
what kind of terms
you two were on

12:23.709 --> 12:25.167
- since she moved back home...
- No-no-no, no.

12:25.169 --> 12:27.128
What's, uh...
what's going on with her?

12:27.130 --> 12:28.837
Oh, she seems...
she seems good.

12:28.839 --> 12:30.339
She's dating somebody.

12:30.341 --> 12:32.008
She's, uh, managing
her dad's ice cream store.

12:32.010 --> 12:33.426
- She is?
- Yeah.

12:33.428 --> 12:35.552
But they've
turned it into this kind of

12:35.554 --> 12:37.846
low-sugar, no-sugar
kind of thing.

12:37.848 --> 12:39.890
Everybody's doing that now.
It's, like, organic...

12:39.892 --> 12:41.433
- No, no, I mean...
- No salt, no sugar...

12:41.435 --> 12:43.269
I mean, she's...
she's dating someone?

12:43.271 --> 12:46.688
Oh, that's right,
you are not on Facebook.

12:46.690 --> 12:49.107
I've gotten in touch with
so many friends from my past.

12:49.109 --> 12:51.067
Ma, who's... who's the guy?

12:51.069 --> 12:52.320
Oh, Eddie Wachtell.

12:52.322 --> 12:54.614
Eddie Wachtell?
Who's Eddie Wachtell?

12:54.616 --> 12:58.033
He is the new town dentist,
very nice.

12:58.035 --> 13:01.453
Ma, I...
is this guy your dentist?

13:01.455 --> 13:03.456
Well, who else
am I gonna see?

13:03.458 --> 13:06.625
I don't know, just maybe
not my ex's boyfriend.

13:06.627 --> 13:10.046
Dustin, I'm not gonna drive
10 miles out of the way

13:10.048 --> 13:12.298
to go to
the next-closest dentist.

13:12.300 --> 13:15.467
Besides, Eddie's
very, very gentle.

13:15.469 --> 13:16.927
Oh, you want me to make
an appointment with him

13:16.929 --> 13:19.804
while you're here?

13:19.806 --> 13:21.974
I'll drive the 10 miles.

13:24.896 --> 13:28.397
Oh, no,
you will not in front of me!

13:28.399 --> 13:30.232
Give me that.

13:30.234 --> 13:32.902
Give it here.

13:32.904 --> 13:34.861
None of that in my house.

13:36.907 --> 13:38.282
What was that?

13:38.284 --> 13:40.826
Yes, Mom.

13:52.298 --> 13:55.466
Here we are, baby.
Home sweet home.

13:57.344 --> 13:59.302
Oh, gosh, let me get that.
I'll be right back.

13:59.304 --> 14:01.013
Okay.

14:03.351 --> 14:05.350
What's with all the boxes?

14:05.352 --> 14:06.769
Yeah, he's here.

14:06.771 --> 14:09.524
Yup.

14:39.304 --> 14:40.552
So, Dustin,

14:40.554 --> 14:42.889
when did you
become a vegetarian?

14:42.891 --> 14:44.389
I'm not a vegetarian.

14:44.391 --> 14:46.475
I just... I don't eat red meat.

14:46.477 --> 14:49.477
- Oh.
- That's weird.

14:49.479 --> 14:51.105
Why is that weird, Jane?

14:51.107 --> 14:53.441
It's just weird, Dustin.

14:53.443 --> 14:54.900
We always ate
red meat growing up.

14:54.902 --> 14:57.195
Okay, so look, he doesn't
eat red meat anymore,

14:57.197 --> 14:58.361
and there's
nothing wrong with that.

14:58.363 --> 15:00.239
We are always evolving.

15:00.241 --> 15:01.865
Thank you, Allyson.

15:01.867 --> 15:03.783
I guess part of this
evolution of yours, Dustin, is

15:03.785 --> 15:06.453
realizing that minor league
baseball doesn't pay the bills.

15:06.455 --> 15:08.413
- Jane!
- What? I am agreeing with him.

15:08.415 --> 15:11.082
I mean, 'cause we all
really do change.

15:11.084 --> 15:13.293
It's just gonna be tough

15:13.295 --> 15:16.422
for a 30-year-old without
a college degree to get a job.

15:16.424 --> 15:17.715
Jane.

15:17.717 --> 15:19.216
I stopped eating
red meat five years ago

15:19.218 --> 15:21.637
after Dad died
of a heart attack.

15:24.056 --> 15:27.600
So we've covered the red meat,
the job talk.

15:27.602 --> 15:28.934
What's next on the docket?

15:28.936 --> 15:30.477
Okay, Dustin, Jane.

15:30.479 --> 15:34.606
- Look, please, not tonight?
- Tell her to lay off me.

15:34.608 --> 15:36.525
I'm just giving you
a sense of the real world.

15:36.527 --> 15:37.860
- Okay, that's enough.
- The real world is...

15:37.862 --> 15:39.320
That is enough.
That is enough!

15:39.322 --> 15:41.364
We're not gonna be that family.

15:41.366 --> 15:44.910
We're finally all together,
and I want it to stay that way.

15:46.161 --> 15:48.038
Sorry.

15:51.416 --> 15:56.419
Dust, I...
I have to tell you something.

15:56.421 --> 16:02.094
Your sister and Allyson,
um, already know.

16:03.721 --> 16:08.474
Know what?

16:10.686 --> 16:14.145
Yup, we've been
dating for about a year now.

16:14.147 --> 16:16.606
- Isn't that right, Love Bug?
- Oh, 11 1/2 months.

16:16.608 --> 16:18.650
But who's counting?

16:18.652 --> 16:20.278
Sorry, your names
are what again?

16:20.280 --> 16:23.614
Oh, I'm Bart,
and this is Cody.

16:23.616 --> 16:25.991
I can say my own name.

16:25.993 --> 16:28.619
Okay.

16:28.621 --> 16:30.162
- Cody.
- Got you.

16:30.164 --> 16:34.875
Uh, Ma, why didn't you tell me
about Bart and Cody?

16:34.877 --> 16:37.043
Just thought it would be
better if you all met first.

16:37.045 --> 16:40.840
But a year is a long time
to not say anything.

16:40.842 --> 16:42.508
Technically 50 weeks.

16:42.510 --> 16:45.260
Who's counting?

16:45.262 --> 16:49.057
Well, we're all meeting now.

16:53.061 --> 16:54.769
When you are
finished recording,

16:54.771 --> 16:57.190
hang up or press one
for more options.

16:58.609 --> 17:00.400
Ra...

17:00.402 --> 17:02.360
Rachel, how are you?

17:02.362 --> 17:05.573
It is Dustin, Dustin Kimmel.

17:05.575 --> 17:09.076
I just wanted to reach out.

17:09.078 --> 17:11.077
And, uh, I don't know
if you've heard...

17:11.079 --> 17:13.538
you, uh, you probably
have heard, actually.

17:13.540 --> 17:17.710
Uh, Mom's been telling
the whole town by now,

17:17.712 --> 17:19.877
I would say.

17:19.880 --> 17:22.339
Bit of a chatterbox,
that one.

17:22.340 --> 17:25.259
Anyway, I just wanted to...

17:25.261 --> 17:26.928
I just wanted to
give you a call,

17:26.930 --> 17:30.056
just see if you wanted
to catch up, uh,

17:30.058 --> 17:31.307
maybe just get a drink...

17:31.309 --> 17:33.476
martini, three olives,

17:33.478 --> 17:35.769
rinse of vermouth,
your favorite.

17:35.771 --> 17:37.395
Uh, or coffee.
I could do coffee.

17:37.397 --> 17:39.690
If you want to do coffee,
I could... I could do coffee,

17:39.692 --> 17:43.402
uhh, skim milk, two sugars.

17:43.404 --> 17:45.028
That's your coffee order.
I remember.

17:45.030 --> 17:47.573
Anyway, uh, let me know
if you want to catch up.

17:47.575 --> 17:51.911
Doesn't have to be over
a coffee or martini,

17:51.913 --> 17:53.746
what have you.
It's...

17:53.748 --> 17:56.374
You got my number.
Just, uh, bell me a ring.

17:56.376 --> 18:01.378
And... I will talk to you soon.

18:01.380 --> 18:04.089
Be well.

18:07.511 --> 18:11.263
What the fuck was that?

18:14.519 --> 18:17.936
Robby?
How are you, man?

18:17.938 --> 18:21.774
I'm back, back in old Brampton.

18:21.776 --> 18:24.402
Joe, what's up, man?

18:24.404 --> 18:27.070
It's Dustin.

18:27.072 --> 18:28.321
Dustin Kimmel.

18:31.077 --> 18:33.160
Dan the Man.

18:33.162 --> 18:35.037
How...

18:35.039 --> 18:37.455
Dustin.

18:37.457 --> 18:38.958
Brampton High, '05.

18:38.960 --> 18:41.251
Come on, man,
the wife won't let you out?

18:42.754 --> 18:45.631
You... shut up.
You have a kid?

18:45.633 --> 18:47.967
Since when...

18:47.969 --> 18:49.093
Two kids?

18:51.513 --> 18:53.096
I'm sorry, man.
I...

18:53.098 --> 18:56.767
I didn't know that
you were in recovery.

18:56.769 --> 18:59.979
Okay.
That's... that's... that's, uh,

18:59.981 --> 19:03.649
pow... super, uh,
respect that, man.

19:17.331 --> 19:18.623
Ooh.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.583
So, uh...

19:20.585 --> 19:22.835
Gav, what, uh,
line of work you in?

19:22.837 --> 19:25.837
Oh,
I am the managing director

19:25.839 --> 19:28.048
of Brampton Bowling Lanes.

19:28.050 --> 19:29.967
Yeah, after
Blockbuster closed down...

19:29.969 --> 19:31.469
and fuck you, Netflix...

19:31.471 --> 19:34.763
I was like, "I'm starting
my own businesses."

19:34.765 --> 19:37.849
I started a invisible
dog fence business,

19:37.851 --> 19:40.685
and then nobody hired me.

19:40.687 --> 19:43.355
So bowling.

19:43.357 --> 19:44.774
It's a stable industry.

19:44.776 --> 19:46.526
It's recession-froo-proof.

19:46.528 --> 19:49.362
I get free beer,
free food, free games.

19:49.364 --> 19:53.365
Like, if you ever want to
come over, I will hook you up.

19:53.367 --> 19:54.741
Yeah.
Yeah, for sure, man.

19:54.743 --> 19:56.701
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I'll, uh... I'll, uh...

19:56.703 --> 19:57.702
I'll hit you up.

19:57.704 --> 19:59.454
But enough about me.

19:59.456 --> 20:03.209
What the hell are you doing,
Brampton's own Dustin Kimmel?

20:03.211 --> 20:05.377
You in town visiting
or something?

20:05.379 --> 20:08.713
No, I am...

20:08.715 --> 20:11.049
this is looking like
this is permanent.

20:11.051 --> 20:12.718
Oh, yeah?
They moving a farm team here?

20:12.720 --> 20:15.011
Nope.
I am leaving baseball.

20:15.013 --> 20:16.931
- I'm retiring.
- You can't quit.

20:16.933 --> 20:18.307
Not quitting, retiring.

20:18.309 --> 20:19.808
Yeah, but you're
the best baseball player

20:19.810 --> 20:21.102
that ever came
out of this town.

20:21.104 --> 20:23.019
- Yeah...
- You got to go all the way.

20:23.021 --> 20:24.730
I mean, I would have
made it to the pros

20:24.732 --> 20:26.065
if I didn't blow my knee out.

20:26.067 --> 20:27.275
- Yeah.
- You know that.

20:27.277 --> 20:28.358
Yeah, yeah, I remember.

20:28.360 --> 20:29.943
You always used to tell us that

20:29.945 --> 20:32.404
at those parties you threw
for us in high school.

20:32.406 --> 20:35.907
- Ah, those were the days.
- You still doing that?

20:35.909 --> 20:37.868
You still throwing those
parties for high schoolers?

20:37.870 --> 20:40.037
No.
Fucking parents these days.

20:40.039 --> 20:41.705
You know, you introduce
a little bit of molly

20:41.707 --> 20:43.124
to some mature 17-year-olds,

20:43.126 --> 20:46.419
and the whole town
throws up their arms.

20:46.421 --> 20:49.255
It's not like anybody died.

20:49.257 --> 20:52.717
Well, that... that's good.

20:52.719 --> 20:54.426
You can't quit.

20:54.428 --> 20:58.556
I mean, I gotta
live through you, man.

20:58.558 --> 21:01.601
I just... I'm almost 30.

21:01.603 --> 21:03.102
I got no money.

21:03.104 --> 21:07.105
I got nothing to show
for the last, like, 12 years,

21:07.107 --> 21:09.357
and it just feels like
everyone else is moving on,

21:09.359 --> 21:12.612
and I'm just stuck in the same
place, you know what I mean?

21:14.741 --> 21:16.699
Sorry, what?

21:16.701 --> 21:18.159
Nothing.

21:18.161 --> 21:19.410
Oh.

21:19.412 --> 21:20.912
Hey,

21:20.914 --> 21:23.330
you remember my high school
girlfriend, Rachel Kinley?

21:23.332 --> 21:25.165
Oh, fuck, yeah.
She was a babe.

21:25.167 --> 21:27.960
You, uh, know anything
about this Eddie...

21:27.962 --> 21:30.128
Eddie Wachtell?
Great guy.

21:30.130 --> 21:32.048
- You're gonna love him.
- Okay.

21:32.050 --> 21:35.718
Soft hands, soothing voice.
He makes bank.

21:35.720 --> 21:36.928
- Okay.
- He's a doctor.

21:36.930 --> 21:38.304
He's not a doctor.
He's a dentist.

21:38.306 --> 21:40.138
Well, he wears
rubber doctor gloves, so.

21:40.140 --> 21:41.807
If anything, they'd be
rubber dentist gloves.

21:41.809 --> 21:43.058
You can't...
you have to order those

21:43.060 --> 21:44.684
from, like, a doctor website.

21:44.686 --> 21:45.936
Gotcha.

21:45.938 --> 21:47.563
Get a beer, Jimmy.

21:53.988 --> 21:56.071
Hey, can I, uh...

21:56.073 --> 21:58.907
can I see that real quick?

21:58.909 --> 22:01.328
Jimmy, it's okay.
He's the guy in the article.

22:14.716 --> 22:16.509
- What the hell?
- What are you doing?

22:16.511 --> 22:19.806
You know how hard it is to get
an article in this place?

22:55.550 --> 22:57.924
Sorry, we're closed.

22:57.926 --> 23:00.219
You should turn this
around then.

23:03.724 --> 23:06.394
Hi.

23:16.236 --> 23:17.612
So that song was yours?

23:17.614 --> 23:19.739
Yeah.

23:19.741 --> 23:21.656
I thought so.

23:21.658 --> 23:24.911
It's nice to see that
you're, uh, keeping up with it.

23:24.913 --> 23:30.040
Well, that was actually
the last song I wrote.

23:30.042 --> 23:33.419
So you and big Gav
out on the town, huh?

23:33.421 --> 23:35.296
Sadly, he, uh...

23:35.298 --> 23:38.423
he's the only one from around
here who wants to hang out.

23:38.425 --> 23:39.799
Well, maybe if you had

23:39.801 --> 23:43.471
kept in touch with
some of your old friends...

23:43.473 --> 23:46.348
You're telling me
this ice cream's healthy?

23:46.350 --> 23:48.726
Healthier, yeah.

23:48.728 --> 23:52.438
I don't get it.
Why change it?

23:52.440 --> 23:54.941
You guys... this place
was an institution.

23:54.943 --> 23:58.277
People lined up out...
out the door.

23:58.279 --> 24:00.112
This fake stuff can't
compare to the real thing.

24:00.114 --> 24:01.614
Well, thank you
for your concern,

24:01.616 --> 24:03.490
but we're... we're busy as ever.

24:03.492 --> 24:05.867
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

24:05.869 --> 24:08.162
I don't know
how I feel about this.

24:08.164 --> 24:11.790
I think you know exactly
how you feel about this.

24:11.792 --> 24:13.584
How are your knees?

24:13.586 --> 24:17.003
Still there.

24:17.005 --> 24:20.298
You still on pain meds?

24:20.300 --> 24:23.553
Do you get free dental or...
how does that work?

24:23.555 --> 24:26.681
Oh, okay, so you're
not wasting any time, huh?

24:26.683 --> 24:28.266
You're just gonna
get right there.

24:28.268 --> 24:31.810
- Absolutely.
- Mm-hmm.

24:31.812 --> 24:34.145
So how long are you home for?

24:34.147 --> 24:36.147
Couldn't really tell
from your voice message.

24:36.149 --> 24:37.692
So you did get
my voice message.

24:37.694 --> 24:39.067
Why didn't you call me back?

24:39.069 --> 24:42.654
You didn't
answer my question.

24:42.656 --> 24:45.575
Well, I always said I was
gonna give it till I was 30.

24:45.577 --> 24:46.953
Hm.

24:48.996 --> 24:50.998
I bought a one-way ticket.

24:54.335 --> 24:56.045
Your turn.

24:57.672 --> 25:00.338
I couldn't imagine why
you were possibly calling.

25:00.340 --> 25:01.923
I mean, we haven't
spoken in years.

25:01.925 --> 25:04.343
Couldn't I just be
calling to say hi?

25:04.345 --> 25:07.054
Dustin Kimmel never
just calls to say hi.

25:07.056 --> 25:08.931
Then why else
would I be calling?

25:08.933 --> 25:12.559
Well, you're back, and,
by the sounds of it, for good,

25:12.561 --> 25:15.395
and you're telling me that
you've retired from the sport

25:15.397 --> 25:17.315
that kept us from
starting a life together.

25:17.317 --> 25:19.858
I mean, there's really...
really only one thing to think.

25:19.860 --> 25:23.863
Is it impossible to consider
that maybe I've moved on?

25:23.865 --> 25:26.324
Have you?

25:26.326 --> 25:28.701
Please, tell me that you have

25:28.703 --> 25:31.244
and that I'm a crazy person
for imagining this,

25:31.246 --> 25:32.622
and then I can get on with

25:32.624 --> 25:35.165
living my stable life
with a man and a job

25:35.167 --> 25:38.670
that I am happy to have.

25:45.720 --> 25:47.010
Dustin?

25:49.933 --> 25:52.432
You're a crazy person.

25:56.563 --> 25:59.690
Okay, good.

25:59.692 --> 26:02.192
Thanks for the ice cream.

26:06.741 --> 26:08.782
Oh.

26:08.784 --> 26:11.826
That song.

26:11.828 --> 26:16.123
When did you write that, again?

26:16.125 --> 26:18.792
Three years ago.

26:18.794 --> 26:22.046
I think I remember it.

26:22.048 --> 26:25.969
It was nice to hear it again.

26:53.370 --> 26:55.413
Okay, thank you.
Bye.

26:55.415 --> 26:57.123
Oh... no...

26:57.125 --> 26:59.040
No, I don't care
if he's out of town.

26:59.042 --> 27:00.294
I...

27:03.630 --> 27:06.048
He's been rescheduling
for... for weeks.

27:06.050 --> 27:07.592
Fine, I'll do
the meeting on Friday.

27:07.594 --> 27:09.134
I just... I'm really
not happy about it.

27:09.136 --> 27:10.303
It's a very,
very busy schedule.

27:10.305 --> 27:12.054
Okay, thank you.
Bye.

27:12.056 --> 27:14.598
Can you stop, please?

27:14.600 --> 27:18.310
Um, so you think I can
just hand you a job?

27:18.312 --> 27:20.688
Honestly, I don't know
what you can do,

27:20.690 --> 27:24.983
but I am here asking
my older sister for help.

27:24.985 --> 27:26.568
You didn't even
go to college.

27:26.570 --> 27:28.237
I mean, what makes you think
that I can trust you

27:28.239 --> 27:30.155
to help me manage
other people's money?

27:30.157 --> 27:32.866
Jane, you know how hard
I work when I'm focused.

27:32.868 --> 27:35.368
Walk me around the office and
call me an idiot all day long.

27:35.370 --> 27:37.538
I will do whatever you ask
of me.

27:37.540 --> 27:39.789
Last in, first out.

27:39.791 --> 27:42.417
You know what I mean,
the other way around.

27:42.419 --> 27:44.670
Hey, Barry, uh, can you
come in here for a second?

27:44.672 --> 27:45.796
Hey.

27:45.798 --> 27:47.173
Can you tell me
what a good reason

27:47.175 --> 27:48.798
to invest in a bond is?

27:48.800 --> 27:51.301
They offer a safe
and reliable income stream?

27:51.303 --> 27:52.470
Did you know that?

27:52.472 --> 27:55.181
Yeah.
Obviously.

27:55.183 --> 27:56.973
How about on the count
of three you both tell me

27:56.975 --> 27:58.351
what ROI stands for?

27:58.353 --> 28:00.102
- One, two...
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

28:00.104 --> 28:02.063
R-O-I or R-O-Y?

28:02.065 --> 28:04.356
- What the hell is ROY?
- Nothing.

28:04.358 --> 28:06.317
I just... it sounded
like you said ROY,

28:06.319 --> 28:08.193
so I... I thought it was ROI.

28:08.195 --> 28:09.778
One, two, three.

28:09.780 --> 28:12.405
- Return on investment.
- Radius one infiltration.

28:12.407 --> 28:15.116
Did you just say,
"Radius one infiltration?"

28:15.118 --> 28:16.786
No.

28:16.788 --> 28:19.454
- Did you say that?
- Uh, no.

28:19.456 --> 28:20.748
- Did... did you say it?
- No.

28:20.750 --> 28:22.415
- R... you didn't?
- No.

28:22.417 --> 28:23.709
Thank you, Barry.

28:23.711 --> 28:25.752
Okay.

28:25.754 --> 28:28.548
Was his answer right?

28:28.550 --> 28:31.467
Barry's an intern
coffee runner.

28:31.469 --> 28:33.680
I couldn't possibly hire you.

28:48.069 --> 28:50.236
You're casting.

28:50.238 --> 28:51.737
You're casting your bat.

28:51.739 --> 28:53.530
Try and keep it inside.

28:53.532 --> 28:55.074
Look like you're going fishing.

28:55.076 --> 28:57.785
All right.

28:57.787 --> 29:00.456
Still fishing.

29:03.417 --> 29:06.251
Hey, try and keep it in close,

29:06.253 --> 29:08.753
keep your hands in close
to your body, okay?

29:08.755 --> 29:11.214
As you're coming through,
palm up, palm down.

29:11.216 --> 29:14.759
Try and make contact
inside the ball, okay?

29:14.761 --> 29:16.181
You got it.

29:20.268 --> 29:21.601
Hey!

29:21.603 --> 29:24.105
- Like that?
- Just like that.

29:25.607 --> 29:28.774
You, uh...
you like baseball, huh?

29:28.776 --> 29:30.401
Yeah.

29:30.403 --> 29:32.778
There's not much else to do
in this town during the summer.

29:32.780 --> 29:35.239
Right.

29:35.241 --> 29:37.074
- Where's your dad?
- At work.

29:37.076 --> 29:38.951
What about your friends?

29:38.953 --> 29:41.828
I just moved here last year.
I don't have many.

29:41.830 --> 29:43.748
Right.

29:43.750 --> 29:45.040
Why are you here?

29:45.042 --> 29:47.250
I grew up in these cages.

29:47.252 --> 29:49.045
I haven't been back
for a while though.

29:49.047 --> 29:50.296
So I've heard.

29:50.298 --> 29:51.756
What have you heard?

29:51.758 --> 29:54.133
- That you're lost.
- Who says I'm lost?

29:54.135 --> 29:55.468
No one, but

29:55.470 --> 29:57.428
that's what I conclude
from the conversations

29:57.430 --> 29:59.721
I overhear between
your mom and my dad.

29:59.723 --> 30:01.516
I think I know why
you don't have many friends.

30:01.518 --> 30:03.768
- What does that mean?
- Nothing.

30:03.770 --> 30:05.978
What about your dad?
Why isn't he in the picture?

30:05.980 --> 30:08.146
- He died.
- Oh.

30:08.148 --> 30:09.815
I'm sorry.

30:09.817 --> 30:11.317
It's okay.

30:11.319 --> 30:13.818
What about your mom?

30:13.820 --> 30:15.153
They fought a lot.

30:15.155 --> 30:18.657
I overheard him tell someone
on the phone she's a whore.

30:18.659 --> 30:19.493
Oh.

30:23.289 --> 30:27.001
- You want to hang out?
- Sure.

30:28.336 --> 30:30.461
That's pretty good.

30:30.463 --> 30:33.463
So are we gonna be, like,
brothers or something?

30:33.465 --> 30:34.714
Well, you'd know
better than me.

30:34.716 --> 30:37.343
I just found out
about him yesterday.

30:46.186 --> 30:47.644
Oh.

30:47.646 --> 30:51.649
Look how cute you two
are hanging out together.

30:51.651 --> 30:54.026
- You're throwing all this out?
- Oh, honey.

30:54.028 --> 30:57.153
It's... it's all just been
collecting dust for years.

30:57.155 --> 31:00.240
Ma, this is my stuff.

31:00.242 --> 31:02.742
This is my high school bat.
You can't toss this.

31:02.744 --> 31:05.203
Okay, honey, just,
you know, pick out a few things

31:05.205 --> 31:06.913
that you just really,
really want to keep.

31:06.915 --> 31:08.374
These are the cleats
I wore when I hit

31:08.376 --> 31:10.334
a walk-off home
run in Double-A.

31:10.336 --> 31:11.880
Ma.

31:14.507 --> 31:18.049
This is the first glove
Dad ever bought for me.

31:18.051 --> 31:20.051
Why are you tossing
all of this?

31:20.053 --> 31:23.972
Oh, Dustin, I... I didn't know
how to tell you this.

31:23.974 --> 31:26.558
I'm moving in
with Bart and Cody.

31:26.560 --> 31:28.227
You're what?

31:28.229 --> 31:30.188
Did you know about this?

31:30.190 --> 31:31.230
Thanks for the heads up!

31:31.232 --> 31:33.274
Honey, the house
is just too big,

31:33.276 --> 31:35.904
and the taxes are...

31:36.905 --> 31:39.070
- It sold last month.
- It what?

31:39.072 --> 31:41.115
- Your mom's in escrow.
- We close in two weeks.

31:41.117 --> 31:43.576
And then,
we gotta be out of here.

31:43.578 --> 31:46.077
Yesterday I find out
that you have a boyfriend.

31:46.079 --> 31:48.122
Today I find out you
sold the house

31:48.124 --> 31:49.832
and you're moving in with him?

31:49.834 --> 31:53.296
It's a nice condo
across the bay.

31:54.338 --> 31:56.838
Ma,

31:56.840 --> 31:58.715
this was the foul
ball Big Papi hit

31:58.717 --> 32:00.759
at the 2004
ALCS game at Fenway

32:00.761 --> 32:01.762
I went to with Dad.

32:02.763 --> 32:05.932
Who's Big Papi?

32:05.934 --> 32:08.893
Cody, tell her
who Big Papi is.

32:08.895 --> 32:10.644
David Ortiz.

32:10.646 --> 32:13.647
- He's a legend.
- A legend.

32:13.649 --> 32:15.482
Cody, grab that bag.

32:19.780 --> 32:23.740
Where are you going
with those?

32:23.742 --> 32:25.409
Traitor.

32:30.916 --> 32:33.500
So, uh, how long do
we sit here for?

32:33.502 --> 32:36.798
Long enough for her
to get the message.

32:38.633 --> 32:40.508
Aren't you quitting baseball?

32:40.510 --> 32:42.926
Retiring.
And I am.

32:42.928 --> 32:44.971
Then why do you need
all this stuff?

32:44.973 --> 32:48.809
It's part of my past.

32:49.810 --> 32:52.435
- You want to get some food?
- Sure.

32:53.815 --> 32:57.817
Okay, I'm gonna get
the pastrami panini.

32:57.819 --> 32:59.527
So why'd you come home?

32:59.529 --> 33:02.279
I told you.
I retired.

33:02.281 --> 33:05.532
Right, but why home?

33:05.534 --> 33:06.826
Can't you go anywhere?

33:06.828 --> 33:08.661
Something wrong
with Brampton?

33:08.663 --> 33:10.746
I don't know, you just

33:10.748 --> 33:12.414
don't seem very happy here.

33:12.416 --> 33:15.250
Well, we just met yesterday.
What do you know about me?

33:15.252 --> 33:17.420
My teacher last year
said I'm precautious.

33:17.422 --> 33:18.880
You mean precocious?

33:18.882 --> 33:21.007
Yeah, yeah, that one.

33:21.009 --> 33:24.719
Yeah, well, she's right.

33:24.721 --> 33:26.220
Oh, my.

33:26.222 --> 33:28.931
- What?
- That girl's pretty.

33:28.933 --> 33:31.183
- No, don't look.
- I'm sorry.

33:31.185 --> 33:34.353
She's two tables down
at your 3:00.

33:34.355 --> 33:38.649
If you're gonna look,
like, be cool about it.

33:38.651 --> 33:41.193
My back is just killing me.

33:45.992 --> 33:48.034
Yeah, she's cute.

33:48.036 --> 33:49.367
You should go and talk to her.

33:49.369 --> 33:51.369
Like she'd go for me.

33:51.371 --> 33:54.373
- She's probably into older guys.
- What?

33:54.375 --> 33:57.542
Just give it a shot.

33:57.544 --> 33:59.170
What do I even say?

33:59.172 --> 34:02.006
Okay, there's a couple ways
you can go about this.

34:02.008 --> 34:04.884
You can be sincere, or

34:04.886 --> 34:06.219
you can swing for the fences,

34:06.221 --> 34:07.929
say something that's
gonna get her attention.

34:07.931 --> 34:09.888
I'm a swing-for-the-fences
kind of guy.

34:09.889 --> 34:11.098
I had a feeling.

34:11.100 --> 34:12.891
All right, I had this teammate.

34:12.893 --> 34:15.226
He had this line,
never failed him.

34:15.228 --> 34:16.937
- Mm-hmm?
- He'd go up to a girl.

34:16.938 --> 34:18.355
And he'd say,

34:18.357 --> 34:20.899
"I want to eat you
like a watermelon."

34:20.900 --> 34:24.485
Are you supposed to eat
a watermelon

34:24.487 --> 34:27.572
differently than other foods?

34:27.574 --> 34:28.783
You know what?

34:28.784 --> 34:30.493
Let's, uh, table
that one for now.

34:30.495 --> 34:33.245
Just say whatever you feel
comfortable saying.

34:33.246 --> 34:35.580
- Okay.
- Go get her.

34:41.129 --> 34:42.587
Hey...

34:42.589 --> 34:44.089
Thank you.

34:52.100 --> 34:52.973
How'd it go?

34:52.975 --> 34:54.266
- Good.
- Good?

34:54.268 --> 34:56.101
- Yeah.
- Get her number or...

34:56.103 --> 34:59.939
I got her Instagram.
We're following each other now.

34:59.941 --> 35:01.941
- That's... that's good, right?
- Yeah.

35:01.943 --> 35:03.567
- Yeah.
- Okay. Hey.

35:03.569 --> 35:05.026
What'd you say?

35:05.028 --> 35:07.113
Tell your friend his
watermelon line is foolproof.

35:07.115 --> 35:08.531
Wait, you actually...
you said that?

35:08.533 --> 35:11.283
Yeah.

35:11.285 --> 35:12.200
Oh...

35:12.202 --> 35:13.703
Can you tell me
what it means?

35:13.705 --> 35:16.457
I have no idea
what I just said.

35:19.127 --> 35:23.423
Actually, I think
I might just get the, uh...

36:50.843 --> 36:52.884
Just don't talk, okay?

36:52.886 --> 36:54.511
Okay.

36:54.513 --> 36:56.055
We can't meet
at the Brampton Diner.

36:56.057 --> 36:57.430
It's a small town.

36:57.432 --> 36:59.433
Since when can't
we be seen together in public?

36:59.435 --> 37:02.770
Eddie proposed to me
this morning.

37:02.772 --> 37:06.357
And you said?

37:06.359 --> 37:07.984
- Is that a yes?
- Yes, it's a yes.

37:07.986 --> 37:09.694
What... what do you
think this means?

37:09.696 --> 37:12.071
- So what are you doing here?
- To tell you how it's gonna go.

37:12.073 --> 37:13.781
- How what's gonna go?
- My life.

37:13.783 --> 37:15.575
- How your life's gonna go?
- I don't have time for this.

37:15.577 --> 37:17.075
- I just got engaged.
- I can tell. You're beaming.

37:17.077 --> 37:19.412
Look, I'm gonna
get married, and

37:19.414 --> 37:21.538
I'm gonna live in Brampton
with my loving husband;

37:21.540 --> 37:23.499
and we're gonna have three
kids, two boys and a girl;

37:23.501 --> 37:26.669
and they are gonna grow up to
be thoughtful and responsible,

37:26.671 --> 37:29.254
and they might work at
their father's dental office

37:29.256 --> 37:31.131
during the summers, or maybe
at their mom's ice cream shop.

37:31.133 --> 37:32.466
I... I don't know.

37:32.468 --> 37:34.009
We're gonna let them
make that decision,

37:34.011 --> 37:35.845
because we want them
to think for themselves,

37:35.847 --> 37:37.305
but we will be firm but fair.

37:37.307 --> 37:38.555
And we're gonna
do our best

37:38.557 --> 37:39.973
to welcome their
husbands and wives

37:39.975 --> 37:41.433
- into our lives...
- Wait-wait-wait...

37:41.435 --> 37:43.895
- Whose husbands and wives?
- My kids'.

37:43.897 --> 37:45.062
We were just at
summer internships.

37:45.064 --> 37:46.104
Now we're at marriages?

37:46.106 --> 37:47.607
It's all good, just seems like

37:47.609 --> 37:48.941
we're jumping around a bit.

37:48.943 --> 37:50.359
- It's your world.
- Can I finish?

37:50.361 --> 37:51.946
Sure.

37:58.285 --> 38:01.496
And that's how it's gonna go.

38:07.836 --> 38:09.587
- Are you done?
- Yes.

38:09.589 --> 38:12.006
What kind of house are you
gonna build, American Colonial?

38:12.008 --> 38:13.341
I always saw you in more
of a Chalet bungalow...

38:13.343 --> 38:15.720
You're such a prick.

38:25.354 --> 38:27.479
- Hey, hey-hey...
- I hate you.

38:27.481 --> 38:29.232
I fucking hate you
for making me wait.

38:29.234 --> 38:30.316
You broke up with me,
remember?

38:30.318 --> 38:31.651
You wouldn't wait any longer.

38:31.653 --> 38:33.194
Yeah, I may have done
the breaking up,

38:33.196 --> 38:34.819
but it was because
I was so tired of

38:34.821 --> 38:36.738
you choosing the game over me.

38:36.740 --> 38:39.325
And I waited for you to come
around, and you never did!

38:39.327 --> 38:40.868
Hey, hey, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

38:40.870 --> 38:44.372
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry.

38:44.374 --> 38:47.332
Listen, if I could go back

38:47.334 --> 38:50.213
and change it, I would.

38:51.506 --> 38:53.506
Believe me.

38:53.508 --> 38:56.174
Believe me.

38:56.176 --> 38:58.886
I'm sorry.

38:58.888 --> 39:01.763
I'm marrying Eddie, okay?

39:11.818 --> 39:13.191
- Roll... wait.
- I get to draw a card

39:13.193 --> 39:14.484
- Draw a card.
- Am I ever...

39:14.486 --> 39:17.155
Yeah, so you went...

39:19.242 --> 39:20.908
Where are you going?

39:20.910 --> 39:22.993
- Out.
- Can I come?

39:22.995 --> 39:25.039
Sure.

39:27.542 --> 39:29.875
- Okay, what do we have?
- Oh, he's winning.

39:29.877 --> 39:31.919
Oh, he's killing us.

39:31.921 --> 39:32.919
Here, hive him mine.

39:32.921 --> 39:34.004
Sure, go for it.

39:44.725 --> 39:46.642
Can I take a few?

39:48.229 --> 39:51.064
Yeah, get in here.

40:05.747 --> 40:08.788
You're casting again.

40:08.790 --> 40:12.629
Cody, hands inside, okay?

40:15.714 --> 40:17.173
Cody, hands inside.

40:17.175 --> 40:18.174
- Keep your hands in...
- I'm trying!

40:18.176 --> 40:19.424
Try harder.
Focus.

40:19.426 --> 40:22.345
Keep them inside.
Cody!

40:22.347 --> 40:24.557
Watch.
Watch, watch.

40:27.435 --> 40:30.269
Relax the arms,
strong in the legs.

40:30.271 --> 40:31.562
Drop and drive.

40:31.564 --> 40:33.147
You want to be a good hitter?

40:33.149 --> 40:36.149
You have to practice
the right way every single day.

40:37.736 --> 40:40.488
When your friends are off
hanging out after practice,

40:40.490 --> 40:42.448
that's when you get back
in the cage.

40:42.450 --> 40:44.283
Put in the extra work!

40:44.285 --> 40:46.660
Friends will come and go,

40:46.662 --> 40:49.372
but this game only gives you
so many opportunities.

40:49.374 --> 40:51.165
It's not how good
you want to be.

40:51.167 --> 40:53.959
It's how good
you're willing to be!

40:53.961 --> 40:56.129
Fuck!

41:11.312 --> 41:13.479
You like this ice cream?

41:13.481 --> 41:17.232
I mean, it's no Clean Sweets,
but it's good.

41:17.234 --> 41:18.776
Clean Sweets.

41:18.778 --> 41:21.319
They make fake ice cream,
you know?

41:21.321 --> 41:22.946
This stuff,
this is the real deal,

41:22.948 --> 41:25.408
real sugar, real ingredients.

41:25.410 --> 41:27.951
Sounds like you got
something against Clean Sweets.

41:27.953 --> 41:30.955
It's just not the place
it used to be, that's all.

41:32.792 --> 41:35.334
So you gonna
answer my question?

41:35.336 --> 41:37.962
Which one?
You only got about a thousand.

41:37.964 --> 41:42.008
Why you chose to come
back home to Brampton.

41:42.010 --> 41:43.884
It's complicated.

41:43.886 --> 41:45.093
Adults always say that when

41:45.095 --> 41:48.430
they don't want
to answer to a kid.

41:50.685 --> 41:52.310
A girl.

41:52.312 --> 41:54.020
Women.

41:54.022 --> 41:56.229
Women.

41:56.231 --> 41:58.232
Think you'll get her?

41:58.234 --> 42:00.359
It's not looking good.

42:00.361 --> 42:01.944
Well, did you tell her
you want to eat her

42:01.946 --> 42:03.154
like a watermelon?

42:05.200 --> 42:07.408
I haven't.
Maybe that's the issue.

42:07.410 --> 42:09.075
Well, I mean,
it worked for me.

42:09.077 --> 42:11.705
Just saying.

42:16.461 --> 42:18.419
Yeah, we had a good run, but

42:18.421 --> 42:20.046
she wanted to hang out
on the weekends.

42:20.048 --> 42:22.089
It's just like,
"Weekends I'm busy."

42:22.091 --> 42:23.716
Saturdays are for the boys.

42:23.718 --> 42:25.343
Sundays, watching football.

42:25.345 --> 42:28.720
And then Mondays,
you got Monday night football.

42:28.722 --> 42:30.430
Right, right.

42:30.432 --> 42:33.725
What about Tuesday
or Wednesday or something?

42:33.727 --> 42:34.894
Totally free.

42:34.896 --> 42:36.895
And then
Thursday night football.

42:36.897 --> 42:40.066
And Friday,
she hates it when I black out.

42:40.068 --> 42:41.316
I can't believe
there's not more

42:41.318 --> 42:42.526
prospects out there for you.

42:42.528 --> 42:43.611
Exactly.

42:43.613 --> 42:45.111
That's what I was saying.
I'm a catch.

42:45.113 --> 42:46.571
If you want,
I could ask Jane, you know,

42:46.573 --> 42:50.700
see if there's someone
who can handle the schedule.

42:50.702 --> 42:52.912
Dr. Wachtell!

42:52.914 --> 42:55.580
- Hey!
- Gavin, how are you?

42:55.582 --> 42:57.332
- Great.
- How's the gum recession?

42:57.334 --> 42:59.834
Ah, still a little sensitive
to cold water.

42:59.836 --> 43:02.046
Why don't you go ahead
and set another appointment?

43:02.048 --> 43:03.129
We'll get you all fixed up.

43:03.131 --> 43:04.423
Yeah, I'll have my mom call.

43:04.425 --> 43:06.676
Oh, you got to meet my buddy,
Dustin.

43:06.678 --> 43:08.218
Dustin, get over here.

43:09.763 --> 43:11.221
Hi.

43:11.223 --> 43:12.973
No, come over here.

43:12.975 --> 43:14.767
Meet Eddie.

43:14.769 --> 43:16.017
Fuck.

43:42.964 --> 43:46.674
Eddie, this is Dustin,
my best friend.

43:46.676 --> 43:48.383
Dustin, this is Eddie,

43:48.385 --> 43:50.011
the greatest dentist
in the Northeast.

43:50.013 --> 43:52.638
If you're looking for a guy,
look no further.

43:52.640 --> 43:53.973
Nice to meet you.

43:53.975 --> 43:55.223
- Dustin, you look familiar.
- Really?

43:55.225 --> 43:56.558
I don't... I don't know why.
I don't...

43:56.560 --> 43:58.560
Oh, you guys
are Eskimo brothers.

43:58.562 --> 43:59.937
We're what?

43:59.939 --> 44:02.147
You know, like,
Eskimo brothers,

44:02.149 --> 44:04.316
share the same igloo.

44:04.318 --> 44:05.901
You banged the same chick.

44:05.903 --> 44:07.153
- Right.
- Oh.

44:07.155 --> 44:10.990
Then that would
make you Dustin Kimmel.

44:10.992 --> 44:12.241
Uh, Rachel told me
that you guys used to

44:12.243 --> 44:13.366
date back in the day.

44:13.368 --> 44:14.826
You were high school sweethearts

44:14.828 --> 44:16.453
or each other's first loves
or something like that.

44:16.455 --> 44:18.663
I love that stuff.
That's so sweet.

44:18.665 --> 44:19.957
Yeah, yeah.

44:19.959 --> 44:21.292
Dust, this is
the guy Rachel's dating.

44:21.294 --> 44:23.044
- Yeah, yeah, I...
- Well, actually.

44:23.046 --> 44:27.506
As of yesterday, we're engaged.

44:27.508 --> 44:30.176
Oh, get
the shit out of here, Doc!

44:30.178 --> 44:32.011
Oh, that's great news.

44:32.013 --> 44:33.428
Congrat...
here, let me see the ring.

44:33.430 --> 44:34.721
- Uh, I don't...
- Er, yeah, nope, yeah.

44:34.723 --> 44:37.642
You give the girl the ring.
I... I knew...

44:37.644 --> 44:39.810
- Right, that's right.
- I've never been engaged.

44:39.812 --> 44:41.937
Uh, almost once, but.

44:41.939 --> 44:43.564
Anyway, it was
great to meet you.

44:43.566 --> 44:45.024
- Congratulations, man.
- Thanks.

44:45.026 --> 44:46.441
Hey, listen, uh, you two should

44:46.443 --> 44:47.734
come to the engagement party.

44:47.736 --> 44:49.028
It's tomorrow night.
It's 8:00 p.m.

44:49.030 --> 44:50.029
It's at Barbetto's.

44:50.031 --> 44:51.863
Oh, I am in.

44:51.865 --> 44:54.700
Eddie, I don't... it might be
a little weird for you...

44:54.702 --> 44:56.201
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no,

44:56.203 --> 44:57.703
no, no,
no, not at all.

44:57.705 --> 45:02.332
Rachel and I are...
we're all... all across

45:02.334 --> 45:04.584
every... every cha... chapter.

45:04.586 --> 45:07.171
We... we're on the same page,
is what I'm saying.

45:07.173 --> 45:09.214
We're in... friend zone...

45:09.216 --> 45:12.801
come... coming into a...
into a... a platonic...

45:12.803 --> 45:15.971
just a simp... good, good... good
place... we're in a great place.

45:15.973 --> 45:18.140
I'd love to come, and
thank you for your invitation.

45:18.142 --> 45:19.808
Yeah, they're
in a great spot.

45:19.810 --> 45:21.102
Okay, terrific!

45:21.104 --> 45:22.227
It's gonna be
a full house then.

45:22.229 --> 45:23.520
- Hey.
- Can't wait.

45:23.522 --> 45:25.022
Cannot wait to see
you gents there.

45:25.024 --> 45:26.482
Should I give a speech or...

45:26.484 --> 45:28.234
- Uh, no, I'll give the speech.
- Okay.

45:28.236 --> 45:30.944
- But you... you be there, buddy.
- Bye.

45:30.946 --> 45:32.738
Fuck.

45:32.740 --> 45:34.948
Guy's something special, huh?

45:34.950 --> 45:36.408
I couldn't even speak.

45:36.410 --> 45:39.204
I know.
That was embarrassing.

45:39.955 --> 45:42.790
Ma!

45:42.792 --> 45:44.250
Ma!

45:44.252 --> 45:46.544
What's... what's the matter?
You...

45:46.546 --> 45:48.337
Hey, where's my suit?
I need a suit.

45:48.339 --> 45:50.339
- What for?
- Rachel's engagement party.

45:50.341 --> 45:51.549
Oh, you're going?

45:51.551 --> 45:53.301
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

45:53.303 --> 45:55.468
Oh, I'm so glad you guys are
friends again.

45:55.470 --> 45:57.053
Hey, by the way,
what do you want to do

45:57.055 --> 45:58.180
for your birthday
tomorrow night?

45:58.182 --> 45:59.223
Want to invite
some friends over?

45:59.225 --> 46:01.267
Ma, suit, where is it?

46:01.269 --> 46:03.227
Honey, I... I haven't
bought you a suit

46:03.229 --> 46:05.354
since you were in high school.

46:05.356 --> 46:07.064
Where's the one
you wore to Dad's funeral?

46:07.066 --> 46:08.441
I threw it out.

46:08.443 --> 46:09.816
Oh, it was gorgeous.
Why would you do that?

46:09.818 --> 46:12.236
'Cause it reminded me
of Dad's funeral.

46:12.238 --> 46:14.446
Do you want to wear
one of your dad's suits?

46:14.448 --> 46:15.823
I think there's one in there.

46:15.825 --> 46:17.825
Yeah, I saw it.
Ma, it's so dated.

46:17.827 --> 46:21.455
Well, honey, I don't know.
I don't know what to tell you.

46:36.136 --> 46:38.930
Mm-hmm.
I like this.

46:38.932 --> 46:40.263
Oh, my goodness.

46:40.265 --> 46:41.933
Would it hurt
to put a little effort in?

46:41.935 --> 46:45.102
Looks like you're going to
your eighth-grade graduation.

46:45.104 --> 46:47.062
I really want to fit in here.

46:47.064 --> 46:50.191
- You do?
- Yeah.

46:50.193 --> 46:53.401
Is this... is this open bar?

46:53.403 --> 46:54.946
Yeah, it's probably open bar.

46:54.948 --> 46:57.073
- Can you see Rachel anywhere?
- No, she's taken.

46:57.075 --> 46:58.950
I'd save that for later.

46:58.952 --> 47:01.535
All right, see you
at the end of the night.

47:13.675 --> 47:16.299
Dustin Kimmel,
blast from the past.

47:16.301 --> 47:18.093
Robby, how are you, man?

47:18.095 --> 47:19.428
Hey, man.
Good, good.

47:19.430 --> 47:20.888
The real estate gig's
going well.

47:20.890 --> 47:22.848
I got my face on
a couple bus stops around town.

47:22.850 --> 47:24.683
- That's great.
- Yeah, yeah.

47:24.685 --> 47:27.144
You know, I pay for it.
Gotta spend money to make money.

47:27.146 --> 47:28.604
- You know how it goes.
- Right.

47:28.606 --> 47:30.647
Oh, I hear your mom
sold the house, right?

47:30.649 --> 47:32.607
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. Here,

47:32.609 --> 47:35.903
Take that, just in case it falls
through, you never know.

47:35.905 --> 47:38.531
- "Keeping it real estate?"
- Always, my man.

47:38.533 --> 47:39.866
Oh, you got to meet
my wife, Vanessa.

47:39.868 --> 47:41.241
She's around here somewhere.

47:41.243 --> 47:43.368
Vanessa?
What happened to Steph?

47:43.370 --> 47:45.537
We broke up
four years ago, yeah.

47:45.539 --> 47:47.080
Vanessa and I
got married last year.

47:47.082 --> 47:48.790
Right.
So you guys have, like,

47:48.792 --> 47:51.419
a shotgun wedding
or just something small?

47:51.421 --> 47:53.462
No, it was actually
pretty big, yeah.

47:53.464 --> 47:55.256
Had it over at the yacht club.

47:55.258 --> 47:56.674
Oh.

47:56.676 --> 47:58.216
I sent you an invitation.

47:58.218 --> 48:01.303
It was never... never heard back.

48:01.305 --> 48:03.305
Well, I... I moved last year.

48:03.307 --> 48:05.390
You probably just had
my wrong address.

48:05.392 --> 48:06.892
Right, yeah.

48:06.894 --> 48:11.104
I mean, I did send you
a couple texts, emails.

48:11.106 --> 48:12.397
Right.

48:12.399 --> 48:13.691
When I'm mid-season,

48:13.693 --> 48:15.442
I kind of just
shut everything out

48:15.444 --> 48:17.569
just so that I can
focus and all.

48:17.571 --> 48:19.238
- Right.
- Yeah, sorry about that.

48:19.240 --> 48:20.406
I get it.
You're a busy guy.

48:20.408 --> 48:23.575
Chasing the dream.
Totally.

48:23.577 --> 48:26.162
Yeah.

48:27.539 --> 48:28.788
Well, all right, uh,
catch up later?

48:28.790 --> 48:30.415
- Yeah, man.
- All right.

48:30.417 --> 48:31.625
- Great to see you.
- Yeah, absolutely.

48:31.627 --> 48:33.377
Let me know if you want
to hang out.

48:33.379 --> 48:35.171
Uh-huh. Don't be afraid
to give that to your mom, okay?

48:35.173 --> 48:38.299
Okay.

48:59.613 --> 49:03.367
I mean, the older I get,
the better it...

49:06.995 --> 49:09.331
I... I will talk to you
in a second, okay?

49:10.959 --> 49:13.417
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

49:13.419 --> 49:17.087
Funny story, Eddie and I
ran into each other yesterday,

49:17.089 --> 49:18.839
and, uh, he just invited me.

49:18.841 --> 49:21.466
He was probably
just being polite.

49:21.468 --> 49:23.426
Well, this is me
being polite back.

49:23.428 --> 49:24.803
Dustin, that was
a courtesy invite.

49:24.805 --> 49:27.098
- You shouldn't be here.
- Whoa.

49:27.100 --> 49:29.808
All I've done is just show up
to a party I was invited to.

49:29.810 --> 49:33.437
- Can you leave?
- You look really beautiful.

49:33.439 --> 49:34.814
Sorry, uh...

49:34.816 --> 49:37.316
Yeah, you're
making this uncomfortable.

49:37.318 --> 49:39.651
Dustin, hey.
I'm glad you could make it.

49:39.653 --> 49:40.986
Hey, of course.

49:40.988 --> 49:42.529
- Wouldn't miss this.
- Good.

49:42.531 --> 49:43.698
Well, I'm glad that you guys

49:43.700 --> 49:45.031
are getting
a chance to catch up.

49:45.033 --> 49:47.285
Hey, Rach, um, do you have
your speech ready?

49:47.287 --> 49:48.660
Oh, yes.
It's in my purse.

49:48.662 --> 49:50.662
Oh, good, the one
that we proofread, right?

49:50.664 --> 49:52.372
The one that you proofread.

49:52.374 --> 49:54.165
Okay, I was...
I just wanted to check.

49:54.167 --> 49:57.587
You are gonna be so awesome.

49:57.589 --> 49:59.462
Now if you'll excuse me
just for a moment,

49:59.464 --> 50:00.881
uh, my father's friend is here.

50:00.883 --> 50:02.549
He happens to work
in the mayor's office.

50:02.551 --> 50:04.759
I'm gonna try and, uh,
land him as a client.

50:04.761 --> 50:06.511
You want to give me,
like, two minutes,

50:06.513 --> 50:07.930
and then come over
and help me butter him up?

50:07.932 --> 50:08.763
Sure.

50:08.765 --> 50:09.973
- All right.
- Mm-hmm.

50:09.975 --> 50:11.475
Here's hoping
I don't strike out.

50:14.062 --> 50:16.980
- See you.
- See you.

50:16.982 --> 50:18.691
He keeps tapping me
on the shoulder.

50:18.693 --> 50:20.901
- Yeah, he does that.
- Can you get him to stop?

50:20.903 --> 50:23.029
I've tried.

50:23.031 --> 50:26.156
Struck out?

50:26.158 --> 50:29.368
You do look really beautiful.

50:29.370 --> 50:30.785
Sorry.

50:30.787 --> 50:33.040
Just saying.

50:49.723 --> 50:51.557
I'm good, thanks.

50:51.559 --> 50:53.892
Oh, yeah, no,
these are for me.

50:56.189 --> 50:57.522
Wha...

50:57.524 --> 50:58.522
You okay?

50:58.524 --> 50:59.814
- Yes.
- Ready?

50:59.816 --> 51:01.234
- Yes.
- All right.

51:01.236 --> 51:04.779
Thank you, thank you,
everyone, for... for coming.

51:04.781 --> 51:07.865
I, uh...
I prepared a couple of words

51:07.867 --> 51:10.283
that I would
just like to share.

51:10.285 --> 51:12.703
Um.

51:12.705 --> 51:17.082
The first day I met Rachel,

51:17.084 --> 51:19.000
I knew she was the one.

51:19.002 --> 51:20.377
Aww.

51:20.379 --> 51:21.754
She walked into my office,

51:21.756 --> 51:23.714
and she said
she needed a root canal.

51:23.716 --> 51:26.801
And after she left,

51:26.803 --> 51:30.388
I needed a root canal...
for my heart.

51:30.390 --> 51:31.430
Oh.

51:31.432 --> 51:32.430
I've been lucky enough

51:32.432 --> 51:33.975
to lead a great life,

51:33.977 --> 51:38.437
uh, an ice cream sundae
of a life, if you would,

51:38.439 --> 51:41.857
and Rachel as my cherry on top

51:41.859 --> 51:47.196
has made me the luckiest man
this world has ever known.

51:48.825 --> 51:53.201
That is why I can't wait for you

51:53.203 --> 51:56.288
to become Ms. Rachel Wachtell.

51:59.459 --> 52:02.211
I'm getting out of here.

52:06.968 --> 52:09.134
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

52:09.136 --> 52:10.970
Thank you so much, everyone.
Thank you.

52:10.972 --> 52:12.388
- Thank you for being here.
- Thank you.

52:12.390 --> 52:13.723
Uh, dessert is
coming out right now.

52:13.725 --> 52:16.017
Please enjoy,
just not too much,

52:16.019 --> 52:17.350
or I'll see you in the office.

52:36.914 --> 52:38.288
Rachel?

52:38.290 --> 52:40.667
Yeah, coming.

53:25.046 --> 53:27.048
Listen.

53:31.553 --> 53:34.720
You remember this song?

53:36.723 --> 53:39.683
You wrote this right before
we moved to Washington, right?

53:39.685 --> 53:44.354
Yeah, we were so happy.

53:44.356 --> 53:47.274
Before everything.

53:47.276 --> 53:50.569
Just you and me.

53:56.952 --> 54:01.205
You know, my first couple
of dates with Eddie were fine.

54:01.207 --> 54:02.415
I mean, they were okay.

54:02.417 --> 54:07.627
He was kind and successful
and handsome, and...

54:07.629 --> 54:09.421
people in town seemed
to like him,

54:09.423 --> 54:11.424
and all of my girlfriends
were getting married anyway,

54:11.426 --> 54:14.259
so I... I guess I figured
I would just go with it

54:14.261 --> 54:17.846
and hope that it
became something great...

54:17.848 --> 54:20.808
'cause he was good.

54:20.810 --> 54:25.104
It is good.
It's just...

54:25.106 --> 54:28.191
just good.

54:28.193 --> 54:30.192
You know?

54:33.448 --> 54:35.363
Yeah.

54:40.037 --> 54:42.287
Are you still
an awful dancer?

54:42.289 --> 54:44.582
I am an incredible dancer,

54:44.584 --> 54:48.169
and you know that.

55:38.847 --> 55:42.182
I shouldn't.

56:15.675 --> 56:18.801
- Happy birthday, Dust.
- Thanks.

56:18.803 --> 56:20.218
What's going on?

56:20.220 --> 56:22.513
Just cleaning out
the house for Mom.

56:22.515 --> 56:24.723
You guys have got to be out
of here in a couple of weeks.

56:24.725 --> 56:26.892
You should start
packing up your stuff.

56:26.894 --> 56:28.102
And put it where?

56:28.104 --> 56:29.520
I don't have
anywhere to move into.

56:29.522 --> 56:32.482
Well, it's called life.
Figure it out.

56:38.990 --> 56:40.948
What's wrong, Dust?

56:40.950 --> 56:42.825
Nothing.

56:42.827 --> 56:45.370
What is it?

56:48.874 --> 56:50.499
Is she what brought you back?

56:50.501 --> 56:52.959
You think I came back
to put up with your shit?

56:52.961 --> 56:54.544
Well, I'm glad you did.

56:54.546 --> 56:57.464
I mean, it might have been
more peaceful without you here,

56:57.466 --> 56:59.341
but I missed the chaos.

56:59.343 --> 57:03.095
Me too.

57:03.097 --> 57:05.348
So what do I do, J?

57:05.350 --> 57:08.267
I mean, there's not much
that you can do.

57:08.269 --> 57:10.435
Seems like it's up to her
at this point.

57:10.437 --> 57:12.772
Wow, it's
the hands-off approach.

57:12.774 --> 57:16.609
That's not exactly what
I was expecting from you.

57:16.611 --> 57:19.611
There are some things in life
that you can force.

57:19.613 --> 57:21.782
This ain't one of them.

57:25.577 --> 57:27.453
Yeah.

58:08.537 --> 58:11.872
Happy birthday.

58:11.874 --> 58:13.165
How have you been?

58:24.345 --> 58:28.221
Look at all these gray hairs
coming in, here.

58:28.223 --> 58:30.975
- Yeah, coming in fast.
- And here, here.

58:30.977 --> 58:34.020
- And elsewhere.
- Oh.

58:36.524 --> 58:39.232
Have you thought about
what you're gonna do yet?

58:39.234 --> 58:43.279
- About what?
- About a job, a career.

58:43.281 --> 58:45.450
One step at a time.

58:51.039 --> 58:53.374
Where does he think
you are right now?

58:56.377 --> 59:00.462
I told him I was staying
at my mom's tonight.

59:00.464 --> 59:04.383
I am gonna tell him tomorrow.

59:05.385 --> 59:06.843
- Oh... oh!
- Ma! Ma!

59:06.845 --> 59:08.513
- Hey, Judy.
- Hi, Rachel.

59:08.515 --> 59:09.763
What a surprise.

59:09.765 --> 59:12.225
Um, I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to barge in on you two.

59:12.227 --> 59:14.560
Uh, Dustin, I'm... I'm putting
in a load of laundry.

59:14.562 --> 59:15.895
Do you have enough
clean sheets?

59:15.897 --> 59:17.312
Yeah, Ma, great, whatever.

59:17.314 --> 59:18.564
- Okay, of course. Night-night.
- Thanks.

59:18.566 --> 59:19.732
- Night-night.
- Night, Judy.

59:19.734 --> 59:20.982
What about towels?

59:20.984 --> 59:22.317
You can never have
enough clean towels.

59:22.319 --> 59:24.028
Ma, I... I use
the same towel all week.

59:24.030 --> 59:25.571
Oh.

59:25.573 --> 59:26.988
- Please close the door.
- Oh.

59:26.990 --> 59:28.573
- Please.
- Oh okay, night-night.

59:28.575 --> 59:30.577
- Thank you.
- Good night.

59:34.790 --> 59:36.792
It's just like high school.

59:50.265 --> 59:53.933
Everything's gonna be fine.

59:53.935 --> 59:58.104
I know.

59:58.106 --> 01:00:01.941
Hey.
Hey, look at me.

01:00:05.946 --> 01:00:08.156
We're gonna be happy.

01:01:28.196 --> 01:01:30.365
Skip, what's up?

01:01:39.289 --> 01:01:41.500
Okay.

01:01:55.890 --> 01:01:57.767
Hey.

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:01.394
Okay, so, uh,

01:02:01.396 --> 01:02:03.562
I am meeting up with Eddie
later at his place,

01:02:03.564 --> 01:02:06.899
and I'm gonna tell him then.

01:02:06.901 --> 01:02:08.484
Okay, okay, good, good.

01:02:08.486 --> 01:02:10.111
You know, I'm really sorry
if last night

01:02:10.113 --> 01:02:11.988
I didn't seem as assured
as you were about everything,

01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:13.446
but you know,
I woke up this morning,

01:02:13.448 --> 01:02:14.573
and I just... I feel good.

01:02:14.575 --> 01:02:17.910
I feel really, really good.

01:02:17.912 --> 01:02:20.162
Me too.

01:02:20.164 --> 01:02:22.122
Is everything all right?

01:02:22.124 --> 01:02:23.499
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:02:23.501 --> 01:02:26.921
It's all good stuff.

01:02:30.091 --> 01:02:32.258
I got the call.

01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:36.928
- What call?
- The call.

01:02:36.930 --> 01:02:43.519
Seattle's catcher got injured,
and they want me to fly to LA,

01:02:43.521 --> 01:02:49.609
finish the series against the
Angels as the second catcher.

01:02:49.611 --> 01:02:50.984
This is a good thing.

01:02:50.986 --> 01:02:52.944
Yes.
Yes, it is.

01:02:52.946 --> 01:02:54.238
It's... it's great news.

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:58.116
Uh, I am very proud of you.

01:02:58.118 --> 01:03:01.328
- Thank you.
- Then what?

01:03:01.330 --> 01:03:03.663
Wh... what do you mean?

01:03:03.665 --> 01:03:05.917
Well, after the playoffs,

01:03:05.919 --> 01:03:08.461
does that mean
that you're gonna be

01:03:08.463 --> 01:03:10.754
playing for Seattle
next year or...

01:03:10.756 --> 01:03:14.383
I get the idea
that this would be

01:03:14.385 --> 01:03:16.593
a one-series deal, and then...

01:03:16.595 --> 01:03:20.430
And then you'd be back
to trying out next year?

01:03:20.432 --> 01:03:22.308
I... I don't know.
I don't know what next year...

01:03:22.310 --> 01:03:24.477
No, I... I do,
because you're incapable

01:03:24.479 --> 01:03:25.810
of just having a little taste,

01:03:25.812 --> 01:03:27.562
and you would keep chasing it,
and then

01:03:27.564 --> 01:03:29.899
we're gonna be back
where we were three years ago.

01:03:29.901 --> 01:03:34.069
I haven't... I haven't even
made any decisions yet.

01:03:34.071 --> 01:03:37.198
We both know you have.

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:39.535
Hey, hey.

01:04:19.158 --> 01:04:21.241
Good luck, Dustin.

01:04:21.243 --> 01:04:23.618
Thanks, Bart.

01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:26.205
All right, buddy,
keep practicing.

01:04:26.207 --> 01:04:28.165
Will do.

01:04:28.167 --> 01:04:29.625
Come here.

01:04:29.627 --> 01:04:32.252
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

01:04:34.298 --> 01:04:36.131
Oh, Lord, not this one.

01:04:36.133 --> 01:04:37.633
I called it!

01:04:37.635 --> 01:04:39.676
I told you!
I told you, you...

01:04:39.678 --> 01:04:40.970
- Ohh...
- We did it!

01:04:40.972 --> 01:04:42.596
- We did it, buddy!
- We did do it.

01:04:42.598 --> 01:04:43.930
You and me...
you need an assistant?

01:04:43.932 --> 01:04:45.640
- I'm your guy.
- I thought you would be.

01:04:45.642 --> 01:04:47.100
- Hey, Jane.
- Hey, you.

01:04:47.102 --> 01:04:48.185
Yeah, thanks, bud.

01:04:48.187 --> 01:04:50.020
Oh, get in there.

01:04:50.022 --> 01:04:52.189
Yes.

01:04:52.191 --> 01:04:55.402
So how'd she take it?

01:04:56.653 --> 01:05:00.281
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

01:05:00.283 --> 01:05:03.618
Listen, you know what?

01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:06.828
You deserve this.
I'm proud of you, kay?

01:05:06.830 --> 01:05:09.540
All right, give me a hug.

01:05:43.075 --> 01:05:45.993
Oh, thank you.

01:05:45.995 --> 01:05:47.285
Appreciate it.

01:05:57.339 --> 01:05:58.506
Dustin.

01:05:58.508 --> 01:05:59.924
- Oh, hey.
- Hi. I'm Hal.

01:05:59.926 --> 01:06:01.508
Welcome.
We're happy to have you here.

01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:03.051
- Thank you.
- Let me grab this for you.

01:06:03.053 --> 01:06:04.303
- Oh, you didn't have to...
- How was your flight in?

01:06:04.305 --> 01:06:05.470
Uh, great, thank you.

01:06:05.472 --> 01:06:07.138
Was the car service
there on time?

01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:08.808
- Yeah, yeah, it was great.
- We're using a new company,

01:06:08.810 --> 01:06:10.100
and want to make sure our
players are happy with it.

01:06:10.102 --> 01:06:11.894
- Oh, oh...
- Thank you very much.

01:06:11.896 --> 01:06:13.687
- Yeah, he was great, really.
- Got you all checked in.

01:06:13.689 --> 01:06:15.064
In there, you're gonna find
your scouting report on Anaheim,

01:06:15.066 --> 01:06:16.982
you room key, and your
per diem for the night.

01:06:16.984 --> 01:06:17.984
100?

01:06:17.986 --> 01:06:19.442
It's more than
you're used to, huh?

01:06:19.444 --> 01:06:20.778
Yeah, just a little.

01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:22.488
Now, all the players
are out to dinner.

01:06:22.490 --> 01:06:23.865
It's pretty late,
so I would suggest

01:06:23.867 --> 01:06:25.616
you grab room service
in your room

01:06:25.618 --> 01:06:26.825
or something to eat
right there at the bar.

01:06:26.827 --> 01:06:27.868
Okay.

01:06:27.870 --> 01:06:29.287
Tomorrow morning
there's a players breakfast

01:06:29.289 --> 01:06:31.037
in one of the conference rooms
here at the hotel.

01:06:31.039 --> 01:06:33.332
All the information
is in there.

01:06:35.794 --> 01:06:38.169
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

01:06:38.171 --> 01:06:41.924
Oh, uh, who's my roommate?

01:06:41.926 --> 01:06:43.258
Welcome to the show.

01:06:48.850 --> 01:06:51.183
Okay.

01:07:14.584 --> 01:07:17.167
No way.

01:07:17.169 --> 01:07:20.214
Oh...

01:08:06.218 --> 01:08:09.347
My man, can I get a club soda,
please?

01:08:13.184 --> 01:08:16.060
Diego Alomar?

01:08:16.062 --> 01:08:19.688
Hey, man, Dustin Kimmel,
catcher brought up from Tacoma.

01:08:19.689 --> 01:08:21.148
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.

01:08:21.149 --> 01:08:22.608
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

01:08:22.609 --> 01:08:26.112
Yeah.
It's your first time up?

01:08:26.113 --> 01:08:27.446
Yeah, first time.

01:08:27.448 --> 01:08:29.240
How long's it been?

01:08:29.242 --> 01:08:31.617
12 years.

01:08:31.618 --> 01:08:36.162
Shit.

01:08:36.163 --> 01:08:38.456
That's long.

01:08:38.457 --> 01:08:41.710
Yeah.
Yeah, felt like 20.

01:08:41.712 --> 01:08:43.795
Yeah, I know the feeling.

01:08:43.796 --> 01:08:47.551
It took me four,
felt like a lifetime.

01:08:50.636 --> 01:08:54.348
- Any advice?
- Enjoy the view.

01:08:54.350 --> 01:08:56.017
No matter how long
you in the league,

01:08:56.019 --> 01:09:00.188
20 years or for one series,

01:09:00.189 --> 01:09:03.232
you're always gonna be
chasing another at bat.

01:09:03.234 --> 01:09:06.613
So take it in when you can.

01:09:07.779 --> 01:09:10.407
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:13.367
All right, rookie.

01:09:13.368 --> 01:09:15.537
Cheers.

01:09:18.207 --> 01:09:20.919
It's Diego Alomar.

01:09:33.013 --> 01:09:34.345
Hm.

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:25.063
Hello?

01:10:25.065 --> 01:10:26.983
Hey, Dustin, it's Hal.

01:10:26.985 --> 01:10:28.192
Hey, I'm just, uh,

01:10:28.194 --> 01:10:30.068
coming down
for the breakfast right now.

01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:33.533
Dustin, I'm gonna need you
to pack your things.

01:10:35.743 --> 01:10:38.827
Sorry, I, uh... I don't
f... I don't follow.

01:10:38.829 --> 01:10:40.580
The organization, they, uh...

01:10:40.582 --> 01:10:42.038
they brought up
another catcher from Double-A.

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:43.624
We'll have a car
waiting for you

01:10:43.626 --> 01:10:44.916
to take you to
the airport in 30.

01:10:44.918 --> 01:10:46.251
Be out front.

01:11:30.839 --> 01:11:33.340
Sorry it didn't
work out this time.

01:11:33.342 --> 01:11:35.968
This time?

01:11:35.970 --> 01:11:38.261
When has it ever?

01:11:38.263 --> 01:11:41.559
Excuse you?

01:11:45.230 --> 01:11:47.774
Even my room's moved on.

01:11:50.651 --> 01:11:53.986
What do you want me to do,
Dustin, not sell the house?

01:11:53.988 --> 01:11:57.406
Continue to grieve
over your father?

01:11:57.408 --> 01:11:58.657
Would that make you
feel better?

01:11:58.659 --> 01:12:00.408
- Everybody has to...
- It's not that.

01:12:00.410 --> 01:12:03.746
It's just...

01:12:03.748 --> 01:12:06.581
I... I feel out of place here,

01:12:06.583 --> 01:12:08.000
and I'm not good enough

01:12:08.002 --> 01:12:10.001
to make it in the place
I want to be.

01:12:10.003 --> 01:12:12.587
Who's the one who left
and... and never

01:12:12.589 --> 01:12:14.173
bothered to keep in contact
with anybody?

01:12:14.175 --> 01:12:17.470
I'm sorry if I'm trying
to make something of myself.

01:12:25.061 --> 01:12:29.023
Do you know why you never
made it out of Triple-A?

01:12:31.316 --> 01:12:34.026
Sure, let's hear it, Coach.

01:12:34.028 --> 01:12:37.863
Because all you cared
about was the result.

01:12:37.865 --> 01:12:40.657
What's that supposed to mean?

01:12:40.659 --> 01:12:42.076
It was always about when

01:12:42.078 --> 01:12:44.245
you were gonna make it
to the big leagues,

01:12:44.247 --> 01:12:45.996
when you were going
to accomplish this,

01:12:45.998 --> 01:12:49.041
when you could afford that.

01:12:49.043 --> 01:12:54.255
You never appreciated the now,
the... the process.

01:12:54.257 --> 01:12:56.048
You just raced through it
fast as you could

01:12:56.050 --> 01:12:58.718
to get to where
you wanted to be.

01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:03.889
I mean, you never
appreciated the journey.

01:13:03.891 --> 01:13:05.433
That's all life is, Dustin.

01:13:05.435 --> 01:13:07.434
Because at the end of the day,

01:13:07.436 --> 01:13:11.565
we all end up
in the same place.

01:13:12.275 --> 01:13:14.608
So if you never
live in the present

01:13:14.610 --> 01:13:18.362
and take in
the bad with the good,

01:13:18.364 --> 01:13:20.781
you never live a true life,

01:13:20.783 --> 01:13:24.577
one with purpose.

01:13:24.579 --> 01:13:27.207
Chasing a dream
isn't a purpose.

01:13:30.627 --> 01:13:32.376
If I was so far off track,

01:13:32.378 --> 01:13:37.089
why didn't you
say anything before?

01:13:37.091 --> 01:13:42.594
I wish I had.

01:13:42.596 --> 01:13:46.014
I should have.

01:13:46.016 --> 01:13:48.309
It was just... I knew
how much it meant to you.

01:13:48.311 --> 01:13:50.143
You know, especially after...

01:13:50.145 --> 01:13:54.064
you know, after we...
we lost your dad, you know?

01:13:54.066 --> 01:13:59.569
I just... I didn't want
to get in your way.

01:13:59.571 --> 01:14:03.782
I mean, you know, you know
how proud he was of you

01:14:03.784 --> 01:14:06.452
whether you made it
or not, right?

01:14:06.454 --> 01:14:10.206
Right?

01:14:23.596 --> 01:14:26.015
Rachel.

01:14:32.521 --> 01:14:35.816
I heard it didn't work out.

01:14:40.654 --> 01:14:43.323
I'm sure that's tough.

01:14:53.333 --> 01:14:56.042
Man, nothing turned out well
for you, did it?

01:14:56.044 --> 01:15:00.173
You came back to win
the one who got away,

01:15:00.175 --> 01:15:03.134
and then you won
the one who got away,

01:15:03.136 --> 01:15:05.678
and then you gambled
the one who got away,

01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:08.346
who you now lost,

01:15:08.348 --> 01:15:14.230
all for the love
that you've been chasing.

01:15:15.355 --> 01:15:16.522
Thanks for the summary.

01:15:16.524 --> 01:15:18.482
You won the one,

01:15:18.484 --> 01:15:20.236
and then you lost the one...

01:15:23.448 --> 01:15:25.615
Dustin Kimmel!

01:15:25.617 --> 01:15:26.741
Eddie.

01:15:26.743 --> 01:15:28.158
Hey, Eddie.

01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:29.952
We need to have
a little chat.

01:15:29.954 --> 01:15:32.537
Really?
What's... what about?

01:15:32.539 --> 01:15:34.833
Oh, you know what about.

01:15:36.043 --> 01:15:38.669
It was never about you, man.

01:15:38.671 --> 01:15:39.920
Okay, I'm gonna hit you.

01:15:39.922 --> 01:15:41.380
I... I don't want you
to hit me.

01:15:41.382 --> 01:15:43.006
- Then stop me.
- Is there a fist to stop?

01:15:44.385 --> 01:15:46.594
Nantucket, that felt good!

01:15:46.596 --> 01:15:47.636
Whoo!

01:15:47.638 --> 01:15:49.764
What the hell, man?

01:15:49.766 --> 01:15:50.848
I told you
I was gonna hit you.

01:15:50.850 --> 01:15:51.849
He did say that.

01:15:51.851 --> 01:15:52.892
I was expecting, like,

01:15:52.894 --> 01:15:54.100
another warning or something.

01:15:54.102 --> 01:15:55.519
Okay, you know what?
Shut up.

01:15:55.521 --> 01:15:58.605
You are nothing
but a high school hero.

01:15:58.607 --> 01:15:59.732
Yeah?
How about "you're welcome"?

01:15:59.734 --> 01:16:01.192
For what?

01:16:01.194 --> 01:16:02.777
At least now you know
she's not the one for you.

01:16:02.779 --> 01:16:04.277
The one?

01:16:04.279 --> 01:16:07.572
Dustin, what are the odds
of finding the one, huh?

01:16:07.574 --> 01:16:09.282
And that's not what it's about.

01:16:09.284 --> 01:16:14.205
It's about fighting to make it
work with the one you want.

01:16:14.207 --> 01:16:15.497
That's it.

01:16:15.499 --> 01:16:17.832
I hear you, man.
I just...

01:16:17.834 --> 01:16:21.586
I get the sense
she didn't feel the same way.

01:16:24.676 --> 01:16:27.425
Maybe so.

01:16:27.427 --> 01:16:29.805
That wasn't for you
to help her decide.

01:16:33.976 --> 01:16:36.895
Gavin, your mom called.
I'll see you on Monday.

01:16:38.565 --> 01:16:39.604
What time?

01:16:56.958 --> 01:16:57.792
Nice swing.

01:17:00.628 --> 01:17:03.795
What happened to your face?

01:17:03.797 --> 01:17:04.882
I don't want
to talk about it.

01:17:05.883 --> 01:17:08.968
You're looking
pretty good in there.

01:17:08.970 --> 01:17:11.094
- I have a good coach.
- Oh, yeah?

01:17:11.096 --> 01:17:13.139
What'd he teach you?

01:17:13.141 --> 01:17:16.809
Palm up, palm down,
and don't go fishing.

01:17:16.811 --> 01:17:19.312
Smart guy, that coach.

01:17:19.314 --> 01:17:22.984
- Oh, he's all right.
- Excuse me?

01:17:25.986 --> 01:17:28.487
What I want to learn
is how to take a pitch.

01:17:28.489 --> 01:17:30.740
- How to take a pitch?
- Yeah.

01:17:30.742 --> 01:17:32.491
How to lean into it if
the team needs a guy on base.

01:17:32.493 --> 01:17:34.117
I know what it is.

01:17:34.119 --> 01:17:36.703
Keep swinging like this, you're
not gonna need to learn that.

01:17:36.705 --> 01:17:40.334
Well, I'm trying
to round out my game.

01:17:43.253 --> 01:17:44.796
All right.

01:17:53.765 --> 01:17:54.889
That's it.

01:17:54.891 --> 01:17:57.183
What are you, like,
thinking about?

01:17:57.185 --> 01:17:58.267
There's nothing to
think about.

01:17:58.269 --> 01:18:00.894
You just turn and lean.

01:18:00.896 --> 01:18:03.688
- Doesn't it hurt?
- Yeah, at first.

01:18:03.690 --> 01:18:06.858
But eventually
you get used to it.

01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:11.197
You harden, and
it doesn't hurt anymore.

01:18:11.199 --> 01:18:12.281
Can I try?

01:18:12.283 --> 01:18:13.573
- No.
- Come on.

01:18:13.575 --> 01:18:15.367
- Let me try.
- Really?

01:18:15.369 --> 01:18:16.370
I'm tough.

01:18:19.790 --> 01:18:21.290
- Please?
- Okay.

01:18:21.292 --> 01:18:22.126
Okay.

01:18:28.967 --> 01:18:29.968
Yeah!

01:18:30.677 --> 01:18:32.218
You good?

01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:34.556
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:18:36.557 --> 01:18:39.892
Oh, so that girl sent me
a message on Instagram today.

01:18:39.894 --> 01:18:41.893
What... what?
♪ Playa! ♪

01:18:41.895 --> 01:18:42.728
That's awesome.

01:18:42.730 --> 01:18:43.731
- Yeah.
- What'd she say?

01:18:43.981 --> 01:18:46.357
So I posted a picture
of this new band I found,

01:18:46.359 --> 01:18:48.233
and she said, "I love them!"

01:18:48.235 --> 01:18:49.902
And then she put
a winky face emoji.

01:18:49.904 --> 01:18:52.779
You know, in my day you used
to have to type a semicolon

01:18:52.781 --> 01:18:55.825
and then a half-parenthesis
to wink at a girl.

01:18:55.827 --> 01:18:57.617
Sounds like a lot of work.

01:18:57.619 --> 01:18:58.743
It was.

01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:03.416
I think I like her.

01:19:03.418 --> 01:19:04.959
It's not too early
to determine that?

01:19:04.961 --> 01:19:06.753
Well, when you know,
you know, right?

01:19:08.756 --> 01:19:11.342
So you ready to talk about
what happened to your face?

01:19:15.555 --> 01:19:18.346
I guess I never really knew.

01:19:18.348 --> 01:19:19.184
What?

01:19:21.226 --> 01:19:22.893
It's funny for you, Judy.

01:19:22.895 --> 01:19:25.188
You didn't have
to have the photos.

01:19:25.190 --> 01:19:26.938
You were such a good sport.

01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:28.773
I had an oil stain
on the front of my dress.

01:19:28.775 --> 01:19:30.902
I know. I know.

01:19:30.904 --> 01:19:33.237
The three of you out there
changing a tire.

01:19:33.239 --> 01:19:34.947
- Heather wasn't.
- No... she didn't...

01:19:34.949 --> 01:19:36.282
she sat in the car,
you said, right?

01:19:36.284 --> 01:19:37.575
- Of course.
- Well, she's a big help.

01:19:37.577 --> 01:19:38.867
She's still...

01:19:38.869 --> 01:19:41.328
Still not over that?

01:19:41.330 --> 01:19:43.288
What happened to your face?

01:19:43.290 --> 01:19:45.291
- Nothing, nothing, it's just...
- That's not nothing.

01:19:45.293 --> 01:19:46.917
- Let me see. Let me see.
- No, it's...

01:19:46.919 --> 01:19:48.501
Let me.
Ow.

01:19:48.503 --> 01:19:49.795
Ow, ow.
Come here.

01:19:49.797 --> 01:19:51.755
- I was just in the-
- Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

01:19:51.757 --> 01:19:53.758
Cage.
I wasn't paying attention.

01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:55.300
What are you talking about?

01:19:55.302 --> 01:19:57.094
You've been in those cages
your whole life.

01:19:57.096 --> 01:20:00.180
You never got hurt before.
Here.

01:20:00.182 --> 01:20:03.059
I got it.
I got it. I got it.

01:20:03.061 --> 01:20:06.478
Just chalk it up
to a new experience.

01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:09.482
You said I needed
more of those.

01:20:09.484 --> 01:20:11.108
- Ma, could you give us a second?
- Sure.

01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:12.902
Hey, good night, honey.
Nice to see you.

01:20:12.904 --> 01:20:14.277
You too, Judy.

01:20:14.279 --> 01:20:16.154
- Mm. I was off to bed anyway.
- Okay.

01:20:16.156 --> 01:20:17.490
Hey, what do you want
for breakfast?

01:20:17.492 --> 01:20:19.325
- Just... I'll make you anything.
- Ma.

01:20:19.327 --> 01:20:20.994
I'm sorry.

01:20:22.997 --> 01:20:25.163
His fist looks a lot worse
than my face.

01:20:25.165 --> 01:20:27.457
I told him not
to look for you.

01:20:27.459 --> 01:20:30.126
Admit it, though,
you're kind of glad he did.

01:20:30.128 --> 01:20:33.548
Yeah, now that I can see
that you're alive,

01:20:33.550 --> 01:20:37.175
I'm not that upset.

01:20:37.177 --> 01:20:42.348
Honesty, there you go.
That was never our problem.

01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:44.850
So what do you think was?

01:20:44.852 --> 01:20:46.518
- Timing.
- No, no.

01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:48.728
If you really want
something badly enough,

01:20:48.730 --> 01:20:52.483
you make the timing work.

01:20:52.485 --> 01:20:54.734
I'm sorry about what happened.

01:20:54.736 --> 01:20:56.319
No, I deserved it.

01:20:56.321 --> 01:20:58.697
I mean with Seattle.

01:20:58.699 --> 01:21:00.992
Right.

01:21:00.994 --> 01:21:05.705
I was right there.

01:21:05.707 --> 01:21:09.584
Thought I had it.

01:21:09.586 --> 01:21:12.171
I've been there.

01:21:15.675 --> 01:21:18.216
Am I a bad person?

01:21:18.218 --> 01:21:20.719
Why would you ask me that?

01:21:20.721 --> 01:21:23.430
I broke up your engagement
to a decent guy...

01:21:23.432 --> 01:21:26.060
No, you didn't.
That was my choice.

01:21:34.444 --> 01:21:39.738
You know, if a batter
stands in front of the box,

01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:41.448
I signal the pitcher,

01:21:41.450 --> 01:21:45.077
throw a high fastball,
back of the box.

01:21:45.079 --> 01:21:47.746
Breaking ball's the best call.

01:21:47.748 --> 01:21:52.251
If the batter typically
strides off the plate,

01:21:52.253 --> 01:21:55.715
dropping curve ball's
the best bet.

01:21:58.592 --> 01:22:05.265
You ask me anything
outside that diamond...

01:22:11.647 --> 01:22:14.609
I'm sorry.

01:22:20.906 --> 01:22:25.117
You have so much love to give.

01:22:25.119 --> 01:22:28.328
And one day everything
outside the diamond

01:22:28.330 --> 01:22:31.167
will become much more clear.

01:22:36.256 --> 01:22:39.715
You never should've
had a timetable,

01:22:39.717 --> 01:22:44.469
and neither should I.

01:22:44.471 --> 01:22:50.227
When you're ready, you just...
you know.

01:22:53.314 --> 01:22:55.230
Why'd you come here?

01:22:57.735 --> 01:22:59.568
Closure.

01:23:23.302 --> 01:23:25.512
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:23:37.566 --> 01:23:41.027
I love you, Mom.

01:23:41.029 --> 01:23:42.987
I love you too.

01:23:42.989 --> 01:23:45.408
Oh, I know.

01:23:51.748 --> 01:23:53.706
Are you happy?

01:23:53.708 --> 01:23:57.670
Just moving in with Bart
and everything?

01:23:59.713 --> 01:24:01.087
Yeah.

01:24:01.089 --> 01:24:06.093
Yeah, I am.

01:24:06.095 --> 01:24:09.138
Good.

01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:13.309
- Thank you.
- For what?

01:24:13.311 --> 01:24:15.685
Putting up with me.

01:24:15.687 --> 01:24:19.734
Yeah, that's what
I signed up for.
