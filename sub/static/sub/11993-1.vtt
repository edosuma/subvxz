03:14.078 --> 03:15.480
Thank you, Mr. Angus.

03:21.786 --> 03:23.488
You have no signal.

03:24.455 --> 03:25.757
Here.

03:30.728 --> 03:33.664
Look. You need a signal.

03:39.937 --> 03:42.340
Otherwise you walk a few steps
or you climb.

03:42.473 --> 03:44.942
And there's a problem
or you think there's a problem

03:45.076 --> 03:47.278
- you call me, understand?
- Alright, boss.

03:47.412 --> 03:48.813
- Day or night.
- Okay, boss.

04:29.487 --> 04:30.688
Samuel...

04:32.990 --> 04:34.592
Haven't you ever got the feeling

04:34.725 --> 04:37.094
that what's happening
isn't really happening?

04:42.400 --> 04:44.669
My husband...

04:44.802 --> 04:47.772
Angus thinks I have got
a lot of rubbish in my head.

06:06.417 --> 06:09.587
That was just beautiful, Mattis.

06:09.720 --> 06:12.323
That was just beautiful!

06:17.528 --> 06:20.031
I forgot my purse in my room.

06:20.164 --> 06:21.198
Next time...

06:46.023 --> 06:47.658
It's all the same for him!

06:47.792 --> 06:49.727
What'd he do with money, anyway?

06:50.661 --> 06:52.096
I don't understand French!

08:19.450 --> 08:21.519
That's it, dad.
I've brought them all in.

08:21.652 --> 08:23.054
A gift.

08:23.754 --> 08:25.623
From Angus's wife.

08:25.756 --> 08:27.258
For us?

08:39.102 --> 08:41.172
- Dad?
- What?

08:43.541 --> 08:45.376
Do you like dogs?

08:45.509 --> 08:47.311
Everybody likes dogs.

08:48.679 --> 08:50.247
Even stray dogs?

08:52.984 --> 08:55.153
I threw a rock at a dog today.

08:59.290 --> 09:00.424
Samuel?

09:03.194 --> 09:04.829
I just heated some coffee.

09:04.862 --> 09:06.464
No, thank you, I'm in a hurry.

09:06.497 --> 09:10.435
I need extra men to reinforce
the fencing tomorrow morning.

09:10.968 --> 09:12.770
I'll come by and get you at six.

09:21.579 --> 09:25.082
Almighty God, our Father in heaven,
watch over us.

09:27.718 --> 09:31.622
Guide me towards a good job

09:31.756 --> 09:33.924
where I may fulfill our needs.

09:35.993 --> 09:38.162
Almighty Benefactor,

09:39.130 --> 09:41.465
in your mercy

09:41.599 --> 09:45.369
protect our rosebushes
and make them grow.

09:45.503 --> 09:46.904
Waldo...

09:48.572 --> 09:50.941
You have to pray with your eyes closed.

09:53.244 --> 09:55.379
- Amen.
- Amen.

11:02.813 --> 11:04.648
I'm offering 40 rands a day.

12:30.668 --> 12:31.635
This...

12:32.670 --> 12:34.305
Five...

12:38.242 --> 12:41.712
You have 30 rands,
40 cents and you need 300!

12:54.792 --> 12:58.362
Okay, okay, look. 300, alright?

12:58.396 --> 13:00.097
300 and you come back.

13:08.172 --> 13:11.608
Your brother doesn't have to be
informed about the custody.

13:11.742 --> 13:14.878
But your father must
come here and sign it!

13:17.915 --> 13:19.750
Next person!

15:11.495 --> 15:13.430
There is two in this one.

15:13.564 --> 15:15.532
A big one and a little one!

15:19.069 --> 15:21.738
The big one is a weed.

15:21.872 --> 15:24.374
It's hard to tell the difference.

15:26.677 --> 15:28.445
I'll teach you.

15:28.579 --> 15:30.414
Should I pull it out?

15:32.449 --> 15:35.352
Let's wait a bit longer
to be on the safe side.

15:42.993 --> 15:46.196
Even just a little bit
will be enough for the tests.

15:46.330 --> 15:50.968
I've been holding it in since yesterday.

15:51.101 --> 15:53.537
You should have asked Estelle.

15:55.339 --> 15:56.640
It's hard

15:56.773 --> 16:00.244
to ask your daughter to do something

16:00.377 --> 16:02.546
like that.

16:16.226 --> 16:19.062
Angus is a lucky man!

16:19.196 --> 16:22.799
A pretty bride from the city!

16:22.933 --> 16:25.602
God does not exist...

16:55.566 --> 16:57.634
I've made a new friend.

16:59.570 --> 17:01.838
He's going to help me
with Mattis' custody.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.275
Are you jealous?

17:12.683 --> 17:15.252
Men are so predictable.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.960
What's a poor girl supposed to do?

19:30.954 --> 19:33.790
Change your clothes.
Dinner will be ready in five minutes.

19:33.924 --> 19:37.027
Tonight is an extra special night.

19:37.160 --> 19:38.729
What are we celebrating?

19:41.398 --> 19:43.100
Good money

19:43.233 --> 19:45.569
and even more pay.

19:45.702 --> 19:47.904
Go on, you're wet!

19:48.038 --> 19:50.741
Dinner will be ready in five minutes!

19:52.743 --> 19:54.945
Wait until you see the roses.

19:55.078 --> 19:56.913
I'm starving!

20:00.150 --> 20:01.985
Let's taste all three.

20:07.491 --> 20:09.559
We'll plant some ivy

20:10.694 --> 20:13.697
in the empty grass jars.

20:13.830 --> 20:17.501
And give it away for free with
the purchase of two rosebushes.

20:21.438 --> 20:23.406
Pure figue.

20:23.540 --> 20:26.076
Maybe we could sell the ivy too?

20:26.209 --> 20:28.812
But if we give away a free ivy,
with two rosebushes,

20:28.945 --> 20:32.149
they'll be tempted to buy two
instead of one.

20:41.124 --> 20:43.193
Dad?

20:43.326 --> 20:46.563
My secret tunnel is going
to be one kilometer long.

20:46.696 --> 20:48.331
Your secret tunnel, hey!?

20:48.465 --> 20:51.434
- You don't believe me, do you?
- Of course I believe you.

20:51.568 --> 20:53.203
It's for real.

20:53.336 --> 20:55.005
I've beaten down the sugar canes

20:55.138 --> 20:56.706
this wide across.

21:00.410 --> 21:03.013
It's going to go
all the way to the river.

21:41.351 --> 21:42.285
Fuck!

22:00.570 --> 22:02.239
Keep the meat.

22:42.879 --> 22:45.215
I bought a bicycle today.

22:48.485 --> 22:50.120
With my own money.

22:58.995 --> 23:02.732
The jackals attacked the herd tonight.

23:02.866 --> 23:05.936
They ripped a pregnant ewe to shreds.

23:08.772 --> 23:11.141
It was still alive when I got there.

23:13.510 --> 23:15.745
They'd eaten its fetus.

23:17.113 --> 23:21.351
They'd rip a man to shreds
if they get the chance.

23:21.484 --> 23:24.321
Get someone to drive you
if you need to wander around.

23:25.722 --> 23:28.158
Bicycles aren't an option.

25:05.889 --> 25:07.624
The cat had her kittens last night.

25:07.757 --> 25:09.859
You'll have to put them down.

25:27.811 --> 25:29.679
I'll ask Samuel.

25:29.813 --> 25:32.849
No. Samuel is coming with me today.

25:32.982 --> 25:34.951
You'll have to manage on your own.

25:37.287 --> 25:39.289
What happened to Samuel's wife?

25:42.358 --> 25:43.960
Long story...

25:48.031 --> 25:49.566
A gang from the township

25:49.699 --> 25:53.003
drowned two white women
from the Catholic Mission

25:53.036 --> 25:54.504
for revenge...

25:56.906 --> 25:59.042
She was a French nurse...

26:12.322 --> 26:14.224
I need more men.

26:48.324 --> 26:52.095
Keep as much meat as you like
and burn the rest.

26:52.228 --> 26:55.365
Samuel, come with me,
we're going to take a look around.

28:00.697 --> 28:02.832
What an idea asking me that

28:02.966 --> 28:04.734
I can give you 50 rands?

28:04.868 --> 28:07.637
You can treat yourself...
Buy yourself a new dress.

28:07.671 --> 28:09.573
What do I need a new dress for?!

28:16.879 --> 28:18.414
All right.

28:18.548 --> 28:21.117
I'll make a plan, I'll find somebody.

28:21.251 --> 28:24.454
- Just leave the box on the table.
- Thank you.

28:25.822 --> 28:27.090
I do it for you.

28:27.223 --> 28:29.425
You're good with people.

29:44.968 --> 29:46.569
We'll track them down.

29:47.236 --> 29:49.305
I'll trap one

29:49.439 --> 29:51.407
that will lead us to the others...

29:53.543 --> 29:56.245
I'll kill them one by one!

34:15.438 --> 34:17.706
Tell me if it hurts.

34:25.481 --> 34:27.717
Okay?

34:42.098 --> 34:45.467
Nobody seems to care
about anything here.

34:49.804 --> 34:52.742
I had to get rid of a litter
of kittens this morning.

34:54.176 --> 34:56.478
I asked Mrs. Borgman...

34:59.749 --> 35:03.386
There is this painting
on her outside wall:

35:03.519 --> 35:04.954
The eleven of...

35:06.422 --> 35:08.391
Lady Grey.

35:24.040 --> 35:25.541
How is that?

35:27.810 --> 35:30.112
You'll feel quite well in our place.

35:31.347 --> 35:33.149
I grew up here.

35:33.282 --> 35:35.351
My son was born here...

35:39.889 --> 35:41.824
Your wife?

35:42.258 --> 35:45.661
She was one of the
two French nurses, right?

35:47.830 --> 35:50.633
They never found her body
in the river...

35:50.766 --> 35:52.435
She doesn't have no grave.

35:53.636 --> 35:56.238
Same as the eleven of Lady Grey.

35:56.372 --> 35:58.607
Never found their bodies.

36:00.676 --> 36:02.411
But someone must know,

36:03.179 --> 36:04.880
don't you think?

37:15.751 --> 37:17.753
Kids like meat!

37:24.093 --> 37:25.694
Is it better?

37:26.595 --> 37:28.998
Much better. Thank you...

37:29.131 --> 37:30.499
For working?

37:32.401 --> 37:34.537
Tomorrow'll be alright.

37:46.348 --> 37:48.551
Should I still cook the beans?

39:42.965 --> 39:45.100
- Hello.
- Hello.

39:58.614 --> 40:00.015
Hello, everybody.

40:00.149 --> 40:02.918
We have to disconnect your electricity.

40:03.052 --> 40:06.355
You haven't paid for
the last four months.

40:07.790 --> 40:09.158
I need a signature.

40:13.162 --> 40:15.364
You really don't like me, do you?

40:34.750 --> 40:37.286
I've just brewed some coffee.

40:37.419 --> 40:38.721
Why don't you come in?

40:38.854 --> 40:40.923
No thanks, we've got work to do.

40:43.726 --> 40:44.994
Get out of here!

40:45.127 --> 40:47.062
Get the fuck out of here!

40:48.163 --> 40:50.498
Fuck off! Fuck off!

40:51.734 --> 40:53.235
Get out of here!

40:56.238 --> 40:57.773
Fuck off!

41:02.411 --> 41:03.779
It's okay.

41:05.514 --> 41:08.183
Don't worry, Waldo.
Everything's okay.

41:08.317 --> 41:09.752
I'm not worried.

41:10.652 --> 41:12.187
I'm not worried.

41:54.329 --> 41:55.864
Are you okay?

41:56.632 --> 41:58.467
How's your hand?

41:58.600 --> 41:59.701
It's okay.

42:03.906 --> 42:05.874
We burn all around in the spring.

42:07.976 --> 42:09.745
It's all green again...

42:56.758 --> 42:59.094
Your coin isn't worth anything.

43:00.229 --> 43:02.097
Not worth anything.

43:06.535 --> 43:11.173
Okay, okay, okay.
Look, look.

43:11.306 --> 43:13.642
I give you 50 cents for your coin, okay?

43:13.775 --> 43:15.344
50 cents, okay?

45:04.753 --> 45:07.456
I'm trying to catch
some flies for fishing.

45:13.295 --> 45:16.064
I forgot they cut off the electricity.

45:27.542 --> 45:29.044
Listen.

45:32.014 --> 45:34.616
When we don't hear any more
coins clink in the box,

45:34.750 --> 45:37.286
that'll mean there are
enough bills in here

45:37.419 --> 45:39.454
to pay for the electricity.

45:41.890 --> 45:43.258
Okay?

45:55.404 --> 45:56.571
Waldo?

45:58.373 --> 45:59.975
Where are you going?

49:33.688 --> 49:36.224
Waldo!

49:50.138 --> 49:52.007
Waldo!

52:40.842 --> 52:43.745
You don't think I do this
for the fun of it, do you?

52:46.514 --> 52:48.149
Maybe I do...

52:49.084 --> 52:50.752
Sometimes...

52:54.422 --> 52:56.725
You know what it means to be different?

52:59.394 --> 53:00.829
One day they tell you:

53:00.962 --> 53:03.465
"Now your father is white."

53:06.935 --> 53:08.803
It makes you different, no?

53:10.505 --> 53:12.507
Not all black.

53:15.376 --> 53:18.947
People are so anxious for things
to be black or white.

53:28.990 --> 53:30.658
Let me stay.

53:36.297 --> 53:39.200
Are you sure you've never
had a child with a black woman?

53:43.605 --> 53:45.340
You have to go now.

53:45.473 --> 53:46.908
Go on.

54:12.333 --> 54:14.736
What you asked me about...

54:22.744 --> 54:24.913
I don't know... sometimes...

54:26.481 --> 54:27.949
I've been...

54:31.653 --> 54:33.054
wild...

54:37.225 --> 54:38.793
like an animal.

55:41.089 --> 55:43.992
Take care of the rosebushes. Amen.

55:44.125 --> 55:45.593
Amen.

55:52.901 --> 55:56.104
I remember when mummy
and I watched you fishing.

55:58.239 --> 56:01.709
I remember you caught
a blue trout with your hands.

56:02.810 --> 56:05.313
A blue trout, that's right.

56:05.446 --> 56:08.850
A big blue trout.
Just with your bare hands.

56:11.819 --> 56:14.188
I remember the river was green.

56:16.424 --> 56:18.293
What a memory you have.

56:19.561 --> 56:21.262
Green and silent.

56:21.396 --> 56:24.732
And me and mummy watched
you fishing in the green river.

59:41.429 --> 59:45.366
You don't need a nursing degree
to give him a wash.

59:45.500 --> 59:48.002
That's what I pay you for, isn't it?

59:50.805 --> 59:52.440
Here.

59:52.573 --> 59:54.308
A week in advance.

01:01:54.128 --> 01:01:57.098
I was thinking of the river today.

01:01:57.231 --> 01:02:00.167
I was trying to remember
how many blue trout

01:02:00.301 --> 01:02:02.603
I'd caught by hand that day.

01:02:04.939 --> 01:02:06.674
Do you remember?

01:12:51.018 --> 01:12:53.720
Don't leave me alone.

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:29.189
The silence is toxic.

01:13:30.257 --> 01:13:32.359
In this country...

01:18:36.529 --> 01:18:39.966
- Bring them inside.
- Nobody's there, sir.

01:18:41.568 --> 01:18:43.069
Store room.

01:19:21.641 --> 01:19:23.109
Thank you.

01:19:53.373 --> 01:19:55.942
People were talking at the vigil.

01:19:56.076 --> 01:19:58.111
They said things about Angus.

01:20:01.314 --> 01:20:03.516
I don't know.

01:20:03.650 --> 01:20:06.720
I wish my mother were
among the three coffins...

01:21:19.059 --> 01:21:20.326
Is your father here?

01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:23.196
No. He's got some work at the mission.

01:21:29.402 --> 01:21:31.271
What are you doing?

01:21:32.572 --> 01:21:34.841
I'm putting the rosebushes outside.

01:21:37.343 --> 01:21:38.611
Rosebushes?

01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:42.882
They look like weeds.

01:21:51.357 --> 01:21:54.160
Well, we all learn by
our mistakes, don't we?

01:23:38.831 --> 01:23:42.402
The boy's father said
you can have it back now...

01:23:51.911 --> 01:23:53.246
Who is he?

01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:59.552
I don’t know...
I only saw the boy.

01:23:59.686 --> 01:24:01.588
Where does this boy live?

01:24:06.359 --> 01:24:07.994
I don't know... He ran away...

01:24:08.127 --> 01:24:09.796
You should have stopped him!

01:24:12.799 --> 01:24:14.233
He said...

01:24:14.367 --> 01:24:17.437
his brothers have a grave,
you can have the ring back...

01:24:17.570 --> 01:24:19.272
Why didn't you stop him?

01:24:19.405 --> 01:24:22.375
- I couldn't!
- Why? Why? Why?

01:24:22.508 --> 01:24:23.710
What's your problem with me?

01:24:23.843 --> 01:24:25.712
- Please...
- Go away!

01:24:25.845 --> 01:24:27.580
Go away!

01:28:04.230 --> 01:28:07.300
We're going out to a restaurant tonight.

01:28:07.433 --> 01:28:09.969
I told you, didn't I?

01:28:11.871 --> 01:28:13.806
I told you we'd get rich fast.

01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:17.143
Tonight we celebrate
and treat ourselves.

01:28:17.276 --> 01:28:20.980
We're going out to a restaurant.
We'll pay for the electricity

01:28:21.113 --> 01:28:24.083
with the money from the rosebushes.

01:29:22.141 --> 01:29:24.777
Pick out something from
the dessert menu.

01:29:27.613 --> 01:29:29.582
I'm fine. I've had enough.

01:29:30.583 --> 01:29:32.084
Boss!

01:29:32.218 --> 01:29:34.620
Biscuit and chocolate pudding
for the young man.

01:29:39.458 --> 01:29:40.826
My round!

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:43.563
Beers for everyone!

01:29:43.696 --> 01:29:45.665
And wine for the young lady.

01:30:22.768 --> 01:30:24.236
Look at this!

01:31:02.508 --> 01:31:05.478
Lord, bless our souls.
We thank You for the bread and wine

01:31:05.512 --> 01:31:08.648
we share in the memory
of Your body. Amen!

01:31:08.781 --> 01:31:09.915
Amen!

01:31:19.792 --> 01:31:21.927
- Thank you, Olive.
- Pleasure.

01:31:22.061 --> 01:31:23.696
More beers, guys?

01:31:23.829 --> 01:31:26.732
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Good.

01:31:26.866 --> 01:31:28.734
A toast, guys?

01:31:29.402 --> 01:31:32.169
- To Olive!
- To Olive.

01:31:32.204 --> 01:31:33.939
Cheers!

01:32:06.505 --> 01:32:08.841
From your father.

01:32:23.155 --> 01:32:25.858
A round smooth rock...

01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:30.029
in the river...

01:32:31.864 --> 01:32:33.899
up to my waist...

01:32:37.036 --> 01:32:39.205
I take off my shirt...

01:32:44.477 --> 01:32:47.279
A trout swims between my legs...

01:32:49.915 --> 01:32:51.917
A blue trout...

01:32:52.051 --> 01:32:53.953
In the green river.

01:32:58.591 --> 01:33:00.893
Mrs. Borgman!

01:33:01.861 --> 01:33:03.496
Another one for the road!

01:33:10.236 --> 01:33:12.037
I want to go home now.

01:33:13.239 --> 01:33:14.273
Boss!

01:33:14.407 --> 01:33:15.647
More pudding for the young man.

01:33:15.875 --> 01:33:17.443
Dad!

01:33:19.879 --> 01:33:21.447
More wine!

01:34:10.729 --> 01:34:14.567
Angus says the rosebushes
aren't rosebushes.

01:34:14.700 --> 01:34:16.435
They're weeds.

01:34:33.419 --> 01:34:35.187
You made me eat two desserts.

01:34:35.321 --> 01:34:38.324
We spent all the money!
I hate you!

01:34:40.192 --> 01:34:42.328
I hate you!

01:34:42.962 --> 01:34:45.464
I don't...

01:34:45.598 --> 01:34:48.234
want you to worry about money.

01:34:59.912 --> 01:35:03.449
I'm so proud of you.

01:35:03.582 --> 01:35:08.387
Everyone in town congratulates me
whenever I talk about you.

01:35:14.893 --> 01:35:19.298
You'll never lack of anything.

01:35:21.734 --> 01:35:27.306
I'll make sure
you never lack of anything.

01:35:34.079 --> 01:35:35.681
I promise.

01:35:48.694 --> 01:35:50.296
Waldo...

01:36:43.015 --> 01:36:44.450
Hop in.

01:36:46.919 --> 01:36:50.723
Come on. It's much too cold
to be out walking.

01:36:53.592 --> 01:36:56.628
You know me.
I'm Olive's husband.

01:36:58.564 --> 01:37:01.133
Olive who looks after your dad.

01:37:04.536 --> 01:37:06.739
Your sister Estelle called me.

01:37:10.509 --> 01:37:12.811
She asked me to bring you home.

01:37:53.252 --> 01:37:55.654
What were you telling
the men at the bar?

01:38:01.794 --> 01:38:03.629
I could read your lips.

01:38:10.769 --> 01:38:13.872
You were telling about
the trout, weren't you?

01:38:14.006 --> 01:38:15.541
Yes.

01:38:23.182 --> 01:38:25.684
No, no.

01:38:29.888 --> 01:38:33.325
To tell you the truth,

01:38:33.459 --> 01:38:36.728
I don't remember the trout very well.

01:39:17.936 --> 01:39:19.671
You were quick.

01:39:53.639 --> 01:39:57.376
Did you know where the
eleven burned bodies were hidden?

01:40:10.355 --> 01:40:12.257
You must have lost it.

01:40:17.195 --> 01:40:18.897
Can you explain?

01:40:21.233 --> 01:40:22.968
Do you love him?

01:40:32.544 --> 01:40:34.346
Do you love me?

01:40:35.305 --> 01:40:41.314
