00:25.859 --> 00:28.225
Bud! Your breakfast's gettin' cold.

00:28.445 --> 00:32.438
- I don't want it, mamma. I gotta go.
- All right.

00:45.504 --> 00:48.712
- Morning.
- Sit down and eat your breakfast.

00:48.924 --> 00:51.131
- No, I'll just have coffee.
- I made gravy.

00:51.343 --> 00:54.210
- I made biscuits.
- Looks good, but I wanna get goin'.

00:54.429 --> 00:56.420
All right.

00:58.141 --> 00:59.221
Y'all gonna miss me?

01:01.520 --> 01:05.889
Here's some chicken to eat on the road.
And field peas for your aunt corene.

01:06.108 --> 01:10.067
You just can't get good vegetables
in Houston now. You'll see.

01:10.779 --> 01:12.770
Good luck, son. You take care.

01:12.990 --> 01:16.983
Be careful, you hear?
And don't drive too fast.

01:17.202 --> 01:19.864
- Call me the minute you get there.
- I will.

01:25.294 --> 01:27.330
So long, boy.

01:33.468 --> 01:35.504
See you later, bud!

04:10.959 --> 04:12.995
Hi, bud!

04:17.257 --> 04:19.293
Is that you, Lou sue? Gimme a hug.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.420
Bob! Bud's here!

04:21.636 --> 04:23.627
Hey, Willie!

04:24.181 --> 04:28.800
- Bud, how are you doin'?
- Hey, your new house is real nice.

04:29.019 --> 04:32.227
Wait till you see the inside.
How's everybody in spur?

04:33.106 --> 04:35.848
- I got you!
- You got me.

04:36.067 --> 04:38.183
You're too good!

04:38.403 --> 04:41.270
There you go, darlin'.
I want you to eat some of that.

04:41.490 --> 04:43.651
No? Honestly!

04:43.867 --> 04:49.157
- I hope you're ok sleeping with Willie.
- I hope he's ok sleeping with me.

04:49.372 --> 04:52.364
- I'll get my own place soon as I can.
- Don't worry about it.

04:52.584 --> 04:57.453
- You can stay as long as you want.
- I appreciate it.

04:57.672 --> 05:01.711
- How about some more pie?
- No. I can't eat no more. I can't.

05:01.927 --> 05:04.339
- Come on. One piece.
- You want me as fat as him?

05:04.554 --> 05:06.545
What's wrong with that?

05:07.808 --> 05:10.641
- Where are you boys goin' tonight?
- To gilley's.

05:17.567 --> 05:20.183
Goddamn! The place
hasn't changed a bit.

05:20.403 --> 05:23.770
Just keep walking. If they go
to shootin', drop to the ground.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.981
Bud, come on!

05:26.451 --> 05:29.989
If y'all goin' out there to watch,
you have to pay to get back in!

05:30.205 --> 05:32.787
Hell of a fight goin' on out there.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.990
How much do we owe you?

05:35.210 --> 05:38.498
- There's three of us.
- Holy shit!

05:49.933 --> 05:54.597
- This is bigger than my home town.
- The biggest honky-tonk in the world.

05:54.813 --> 05:58.397
Leo! How great to see you!
How are you?

06:06.116 --> 06:07.116
Hey, bud.

06:07.325 --> 06:10.567
There's three and a half acres
of concrete prairie in here.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.707
They've had 7,000 people
in here at one time.

06:21.923 --> 06:23.629
- That right?
- Yeah.

06:23.842 --> 06:26.629
I don't know how many
they've got in here now.

06:29.806 --> 06:33.970
Pretty good crowd, though.
Let's get to the bar and get us a drink.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.603
- Hey, Marshall!
- Bob, how are you?

06:42.611 --> 06:46.820
I want y'all to meet my nephew.
This is bud. He just got in from spur.

06:47.032 --> 06:50.445
This is Marshall. Wayne. These boys
work with me at channel oil.

06:50.660 --> 06:53.322
- We're gonna take off.
- Ok. Talk to you later.

06:53.538 --> 06:55.119
Give us a couple of beers.

07:07.802 --> 07:12.045
Thank you, everybody, and welcome
to gilley's. Good to have y'all with us.

07:30.659 --> 07:35.494
That's Mickey gilley himself. He owns
this place with Sherwood cryer.

07:42.337 --> 07:45.704
Hey, Steve! Come here.
I want you to meet somebody.

07:46.549 --> 07:50.258
How you doin'?
This is my nephew bud, from spur.

07:50.762 --> 07:52.798
Steve. Steve strange.

07:53.848 --> 07:57.716
Steve and I ran the rodeo circuit
together. He works for gilley's now.

07:57.936 --> 08:00.052
Hi, bud. It's nice to meet you.

08:00.271 --> 08:05.186
Hey, Steve, this is bud's first night
in town. Take care of him, will you?

08:07.070 --> 08:11.484
Hey, girls! Come on over here.
I got somebody I want you to meet.

08:11.700 --> 08:16.660
- Say hi to Bob, corene and bud.
- Come on, darlin', let's dance.

08:18.915 --> 08:22.533
Where've you been?
We haven't seen you around here.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.538
I'm from spur.

08:29.092 --> 08:33.005
- Good morning.
- Morning.

08:40.395 --> 08:42.306
Shit.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.639
I'm gonna make you
a nice cup of coffee, darlin'.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.850
That sounds good.

09:05.462 --> 09:08.499
No, Ethel, you can't talk
to your little boy just now.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.706
Because he ain't home.

09:11.843 --> 09:14.004
Must still be at church.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.886
Hold on just a minute.

09:21.102 --> 09:23.093
Is that you, bud?

09:27.817 --> 09:30.684
Get out the alka-seltzer.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.278
Bud, your mamma's on the phone.

09:40.497 --> 09:42.533
I told her you went to church.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.412
Hi, mamma.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.956
No, I don't have no job yet.
I just got here yesterday.

09:57.472 --> 10:00.964
I'm goin' to the plant tomorrow
with uncle Bob.

10:01.976 --> 10:02.976
Fine. I'll tell you.

10:07.273 --> 10:09.184
Bud Davis?

10:09.400 --> 10:12.392
My real name is buford uan Davis.

10:12.612 --> 10:17.402
But they don't call me buford no more,
except my grandma on my dad's side.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.700
She still calls me buford,
but she's half-Indian.

10:22.872 --> 10:26.990
They call me bud cos my initials
are b-u-d. Buford uan Davis.

10:27.210 --> 10:29.417
- It spells "bud".
- I can spell, boy.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.417
Which pipeline?
There ain't one in spur.

10:37.637 --> 10:41.425
Yes, there is. Came in this spring.
I was workin' on the insulating.

10:41.641 --> 10:46.055
Uncle Bob told me you was hiring,
so I thought I'd come and check it out.

10:49.941 --> 10:54.731
Most of our insulating we contract out.
But I can start you as a general helper.

10:54.946 --> 10:57.904
A flunky, a gofer.
You know what a gofer is, boy?

10:58.616 --> 11:01.358
I think it means, you know,
"go for" things.

11:02.704 --> 11:05.537
Or it could mean you're an animal.

11:06.541 --> 11:11.786
Around here they're on the same level.
Start you at the bottom. You work up.

11:12.005 --> 11:16.044
I wanna tell you one thing. You're gettin'
this job because of your uncle Bob.

11:16.259 --> 11:19.342
He's been here a long time
and he's a damn good man.

11:19.554 --> 11:23.763
I'll tell you one thing more.
You're gonna have to lose that beard.

11:23.975 --> 11:27.342
It's regulation if you have to wear
any kind of a fresh-air mask.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.728
- Got everything you need?
- Yep.

11:35.653 --> 11:39.237
- Corene sure is gonna be happy.
- Well, I'm gonna do it.

11:39.449 --> 11:42.111
Just gotta go for it, can't hold off.

11:42.327 --> 11:44.318
I better get on back to work.

11:44.537 --> 11:48.200
- All right. I'll see you later.
- Yeah, I'll see you later.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.751
Here goes.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.273
See you later.

13:20.842 --> 13:22.878
Hey, bud!

13:23.511 --> 13:25.718
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

13:25.930 --> 13:28.467
- Anything I can do for you?
- Not yet.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.426
Are you a real cowboy?

13:34.856 --> 13:37.723
That depends on what
you think a real cowboy is.

13:38.276 --> 13:41.359
- The other night you had a beard?
- That's right.

13:42.905 --> 13:45.396
It looked good.
You shouldn't have shaved it.

13:45.616 --> 13:48.028
- Who asked you?
- Nobody.

13:56.294 --> 13:58.751
- Know how to do the two-step?
- You bet.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.764
- Wanna prove it?
- All right.

14:49.639 --> 14:51.675
- What's your name?
- Sissy.

14:52.642 --> 14:54.678
- Who are you?
- Bud.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.017
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.

16:25.443 --> 16:27.479
- Hey, Marshall.
- Bud.

16:28.446 --> 16:30.812
They got you carrying mud now?

16:31.032 --> 16:33.569
Beats the hell outta cutting foam glass!

16:34.911 --> 16:39.450
- How did you and sissy make out?
- That ain't none of your business.

16:39.665 --> 16:42.873
- None of my business?
- That's right.

16:54.972 --> 16:58.180
Y'all cut that shit out
or I'll throw you out of the club!

17:04.607 --> 17:06.848
All right! Atta boy. That's my boy.

17:14.075 --> 17:18.159
- Marshall, when'd this thing get here?
- Cryer put it in this afternoon.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.453
Said it might cut down on the fights.

17:20.665 --> 17:25.409
Give all us cowboys something else
to hit besides each other.

17:49.193 --> 17:51.855
This one's for you, darlin.

17:53.114 --> 17:55.025
Make that needle move, bud!

18:00.162 --> 18:02.869
- I wanna hit one, bud.
- Come on, sissy.

18:03.082 --> 18:06.119
- Hold my beer, Jessie.
- Should 1? Ok.

18:10.339 --> 18:13.126
Come on, sissy. You can do it.
Make 600.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.132
Shit!

18:20.808 --> 18:24.141
- Doctor Davis.
- Just behave yourself.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.761
It stings.

18:27.773 --> 18:31.061
You gotta learn
there's certain things a girl can't do.

18:31.277 --> 18:33.313
- Name one.
- I can name several.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.520
Pissin' on the side of a wall.

18:37.325 --> 18:41.910
- Getting laid with your pants still on.
- Why would you want to?

18:42.121 --> 18:44.282
- How do you do that?
- Is it broke?

18:44.498 --> 18:48.537
Shit, no. She couldn't move
her fingers if it was broke. Look.

18:48.753 --> 18:52.416
- It ain't broke.
- I broke my hand in a beer-joint fight.

18:53.090 --> 18:56.207
You really know
when something's broken. You do.

18:56.427 --> 19:00.215
You can't move nothin'.
Your fingers get all swelled up.

19:02.099 --> 19:04.135
Shit.

19:05.770 --> 19:10.309
- Becky! Where's my eggs?
- Hold your horses! It's comin'!

19:11.734 --> 19:13.816
- Hi, bud.
- Hi, bud.

19:23.037 --> 19:24.823
- Shit.
- What's the matter?

19:25.039 --> 19:28.998
- Nothin'. Why don't you just go on?
- Just cos I was looking at them?

19:29.210 --> 19:33.169
I can't keep my eyes closed.
I just looked up and there they was.

19:34.423 --> 19:38.507
Why don't you just go on? They're
waitin'. Someone else'll take me home.

19:38.719 --> 19:43.509
Come on. You jealous of them?
Little cute girls you're jealous of?

19:43.724 --> 19:46.136
Don't tickle me.

19:46.352 --> 19:49.685
- Don't tickle me or I'll wet my pants.
- You love this.

19:51.565 --> 19:54.022
- You hit me!
- Well, shit! You pinched me.

19:54.235 --> 19:57.727
I don't care.
You're not supposed to hit girls.

19:57.947 --> 19:59.608
Sissy!

19:59.824 --> 20:01.780
- Hey, sissy...
- I'm not talking to you.

20:01.992 --> 20:03.607
- Where are you goin'?
- Home.

20:03.828 --> 20:08.572
- How you think you're gonna get there?
- I got a thumb. I got a middle finger.

20:09.583 --> 20:13.542
- Come on, sissy.
- Look, bud, you hit me!

20:13.754 --> 20:16.746
I didn't hit you that hard!
You don't know what hard is.

20:16.966 --> 20:19.457
- Just leave me alone.
- Fine. Forget it.

20:19.677 --> 20:21.668
"Fine. Forget it."

20:22.596 --> 20:25.884
That's fine with me. See if I care.

20:26.475 --> 20:27.965
Fine.

20:28.936 --> 20:31.052
She still pissed off?

20:46.912 --> 20:48.948
- Get in.
- Go to hell!

21:11.854 --> 21:14.311
- Get in!
- No!

21:44.970 --> 21:47.632
Jesus Christ! I almost hit y'all!

22:08.577 --> 22:10.613
You wanna get married?

22:12.456 --> 22:14.196
Smile, y'all, smile!

22:15.709 --> 22:17.791
- Can you get 'em all in?
- Smile.

22:18.003 --> 22:20.790
- Uncle Bob! Come here!
- I already been in one.

22:21.882 --> 22:23.918
Nicel

22:24.134 --> 22:27.126
you want me lookin' at the ring
or just showin' it?

22:27.805 --> 22:32.299
- You switch places with me.
- A little more this way. A little tighter.

22:32.518 --> 22:35.009
Can we do one like this?
Like on top of the cake.

22:39.567 --> 22:41.979
Show 'em your garter.

22:44.113 --> 22:46.695
I ain't got no stockings on.

22:46.907 --> 22:48.898
Let me take one.

22:50.160 --> 22:54.073
Now, sissy, stand still.
And try to look sweet, honey.

22:54.290 --> 22:57.032
My legs are sweatin', mamma.

23:06.343 --> 23:08.800
First dance to the newlyweds.

24:02.733 --> 24:04.644
- Don't peek.
- Ok.

24:08.781 --> 24:12.365
- Bud, I can't stand it. Are we there yet?
- Almost. Just hold on.

24:12.576 --> 24:15.158
I'm gettin' sick to my stomach.

24:35.265 --> 24:37.301
All right. Here we go.

24:40.771 --> 24:44.810
Ok, right there. Ready?
On your Mark, get set... go.

24:47.111 --> 24:50.729
It's ours! I put a down payment on it!
It's ours!

24:52.741 --> 24:56.905
It's 50ft long, 12ft wide, it's got one
bedroom, every modern convenience,

24:57.121 --> 24:59.328
and you can move it if you want!

24:59.540 --> 25:01.531
Where's the keys?

25:04.503 --> 25:06.539
I know we got the keys here.

25:08.549 --> 25:11.541
Here we go!

25:11.760 --> 25:14.172
Bud, don't forget your bride. Come on.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.884
Hey, bud! Has it got a water bed?

25:28.235 --> 25:30.647
And welcome, ladies and gentlemen,

25:30.863 --> 25:33.320
to the huntsville prison rodeo,

25:33.532 --> 25:36.274
where all the cowboys are convicts.

25:37.494 --> 25:40.657
Shit, bud.
See the guys up there with the rifles?

25:40.873 --> 25:42.864
See those guys?

25:45.252 --> 25:50.372
- Ok, look at those guys.
- In white? Yeah, they're prisoners, too.

25:50.591 --> 25:52.957
Damn, those outlaws
make good cowboys.

25:53.177 --> 25:56.715
- How come?
- They don't give a shit if they get hurt.

25:56.930 --> 26:01.264
All they do is lay up for a while.
They'd rather do that than anything.

26:08.942 --> 26:13.106
- Wanna go back to the motel?
- No, I wanna watch the bulls.

26:19.828 --> 26:22.444
- God, they're so ugly!
- Who's first up?

26:22.664 --> 26:24.950
Wes hightower.
Let's see what he can do.

26:25.167 --> 26:27.158
- Which number is he?
- 25

26:29.004 --> 26:32.417
shit, they're gonna be mean, too.
All right.

26:33.509 --> 26:35.545
Cut him loose!

26:37.930 --> 26:39.966
What happened?

26:42.643 --> 26:44.679
Is he all right?

26:53.654 --> 26:55.690
Goddamn! He's gettin' back on!

26:57.157 --> 27:01.867
I told you he was the roughest and
the toughest. I thought he was a goner!

27:02.079 --> 27:05.571
See, I told you these guys were tough.
Look at that.

27:05.791 --> 27:10.376
That bull looked like he was gonna
go over the wall, but not of his choice.

27:14.216 --> 27:16.252
Here we go! Wes hightower!

27:28.105 --> 27:30.266
Who's next?

27:31.150 --> 27:33.732
- Hi, sissy. How're you doing?
- Good.

27:34.278 --> 27:37.941
- What the hell's goin' on?
- That's Sherwood's new play toy.

27:38.157 --> 27:41.900
- Y'all want a beer?
- Shit, yeah. Give me two lone stars.

27:47.124 --> 27:49.706
- Here we go.
- Thank you.

28:04.433 --> 28:07.220
- Marshall, what are you doing?
- Hey, sissy!

28:07.436 --> 28:09.347
- How are you doing?
- Ok.

28:09.563 --> 28:12.145
You ride that thing yet?

28:12.357 --> 28:14.348
Marshall, you ride that thing?

28:22.576 --> 28:24.112
I can't believe it!

28:24.328 --> 28:26.319
Hey, Marshall! Ride the bull!

28:26.538 --> 28:29.996
Shit, no! I'm gonna hang on
to my family jewels!

28:30.209 --> 28:33.701
- Where's your sporting blood?
- It's $2 for eight seconds.

28:33.921 --> 28:37.129
It's what they train rodeo riders on.
It's a bucking machine.

28:37.341 --> 28:39.172
You ride it and I'll watch you.

28:39.384 --> 28:41.750
- Hell, I'll ride it!
- No, you won't!

28:41.970 --> 28:45.508
- First you gotta sign a release.
- And give this lady $2.

28:45.724 --> 28:48.181
He's gonna bust his ass anyway.

28:49.811 --> 28:54.771
Sign there. In case you bust your ass,
you're not gonna hold gilley's liable.

28:55.609 --> 28:58.817
Hey, bud! Come back here a minute.

28:59.029 --> 29:02.692
- You ever rode a bull before?
- No, but I rode some rank horses.

29:02.908 --> 29:05.695
- It's different. Right- or left-handed?
- Right.

29:05.911 --> 29:09.244
- Give him a left glove.
- It's opposite?

29:19.758 --> 29:23.000
- How the hell do you ride it?
- Put your glove in the rigging,

29:23.220 --> 29:27.509
then put your right nut in your left hand
and hang on!

29:42.155 --> 29:46.364
- Hell, I'm gonna ride again.
- That's the right attitude.

29:46.576 --> 29:49.613
You don't sign the release again.
Just another $2.

29:49.830 --> 29:53.163
- Boy, you got more balls than I got!
- Get your knees up.

29:53.375 --> 29:57.243
Get up close to that rigging as possible.
Give him a ride, Sam!

30:24.656 --> 30:28.319
I was so proud of you, bud.
You looked so great up on that bull.

30:28.535 --> 30:31.368
You were the best one all night long.

30:31.580 --> 30:37.667
Well, I might have been the best one all
night long, but my balls are killin' me.

30:38.670 --> 30:41.753
Shit. Oh, man.

30:44.509 --> 30:46.966
Does that mean
we won't be able to do it?

30:49.056 --> 30:52.469
Well, I don't know. I just don't know.

30:55.479 --> 30:57.470
We'll just have to find out.

31:02.235 --> 31:04.271
I love you so much, bud.

31:05.197 --> 31:07.233
I love you too, sissy. Come here.

31:08.784 --> 31:10.820
Sweetheart.

31:17.125 --> 31:19.787
- You know what I really wanna do?
- What?

31:24.007 --> 31:25.918
No. No way!

31:26.134 --> 31:30.343
- Why not?
- It's too dangerous! It ain't for girls.

31:32.599 --> 31:34.965
I gotta watch you. I do!

31:35.185 --> 31:37.301
First you wanna
punch the punchin' bag,

31:37.521 --> 31:41.139
and you're always ridin'
my pick-up and everything.

31:41.358 --> 31:43.349
Now you wanna ride the bull.

32:27.654 --> 32:29.565
- I'm next. I wanna ride it.
- No.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.442
- Jessie rode it.
- I told you no.

32:31.658 --> 32:35.276
- Bud, I think you oughta let her ride.
- I think I told you no.

32:35.495 --> 32:39.158
Bud! Thought you got enough
of this shit last night!

32:39.374 --> 32:41.911
- What speed's it on?
- It's on five tonight.

32:42.127 --> 32:44.709
Five? That's high, ain't it?

32:44.921 --> 32:47.412
Look at gator. He's shitfaced.

32:48.341 --> 32:50.081
All right, let's go!

32:51.261 --> 32:53.297
Stay on!

32:54.514 --> 32:56.550
Stay on, gator!

33:02.939 --> 33:06.056
- I'm gonna ride again.
- You can't ride again.

33:06.276 --> 33:07.391
Well, I am.

33:07.611 --> 33:09.943
- Bud, it's my turn.
- It's big c's turn.

33:10.155 --> 33:13.818
- One more time.
- Everybody's waitin' in line. Real nice.

33:37.557 --> 33:39.218
Hey, I wanna ride.

33:39.434 --> 33:41.425
Hello, Steve.

33:43.188 --> 33:45.645
Wes. How're you doin'?

33:47.234 --> 33:48.974
Long time no see.

33:49.778 --> 33:52.394
Bet you ten bucks you can't throw me.

33:52.614 --> 33:55.947
I can't do any gambling
around the bull area here, Wes.

33:59.913 --> 34:01.778
- Ten bucks.
- All right.

34:01.998 --> 34:06.537
- What speed you got it on?
- It's on five. Get your ass up there.

34:06.753 --> 34:09.415
- I'll turn it up.
- Go ahead.

34:09.630 --> 34:13.465
- Steve, who is that guy?
- Just somebody I used to know, bud.

34:14.636 --> 34:16.422
He sure does look familiar.

34:16.638 --> 34:20.222
- Hey, who is this guy?
- I don't know. I never seen him before.

34:20.433 --> 34:23.300
Looks like his shirt's made
out of his mamma's hairnet.

34:24.853 --> 34:27.687
- What's he doin'?
- Maybe he's lookin' up the bull's ass.

34:27.899 --> 34:29.889
He's turnin' it up.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.353
I don't care if he does look squirrelly.

34:35.574 --> 34:38.737
He brought his own glove with him.

34:38.952 --> 34:41.034
Look, he's playin' with himself!

34:42.121 --> 34:44.864
Go on, mister! Ride that thing!

34:46.333 --> 34:48.370
Ready, Wes?

34:55.092 --> 34:56.958
Hey, ride that thing!

35:10.400 --> 35:12.812
Damn! He's good.

35:13.028 --> 35:15.019
Hell of a ride!

35:18.783 --> 35:21.741
Good ride!
Ok, now it's my turn, Steve.

35:21.953 --> 35:26.196
Can't, sissy. Gilley's fixin' to do a set
and he don't like the bull running.

35:26.416 --> 35:28.407
You're a real cowboy, ain't you?

35:29.127 --> 35:32.039
- Come on, let's dance.
- I'll see you in a bit, sissy.

35:33.298 --> 35:35.459
Come on, Wes. Let's get a beer.

35:35.675 --> 35:37.256
- Quit that flirtin".
- I wasn't.

35:37.469 --> 35:39.460
Was too.

36:47.580 --> 36:49.616
Hoedown!

37:45.638 --> 37:48.425
- Just do it for me.
- Ask me how to become a bull rider.

37:48.641 --> 37:52.850
In the afternoon”? That's how I'm gonna
ride it. I'm gonna go in the afternoon.

37:53.062 --> 37:56.600
- You jealous of her?
- I'm not jealous. Are you sore?

37:58.234 --> 38:00.270
You better not tell bud, Marshall.

38:00.487 --> 38:02.603
- What's it worth?
- I wanna surprise him.

38:02.822 --> 38:07.816
Becky! You tell that son of a bitch
to put extra onion on that. All right?

38:08.036 --> 38:11.324
- I want it extra well, too.
- Ok.

38:12.415 --> 38:15.077
- If it's not, I'm sending it back.
- Ok.

38:20.882 --> 38:24.420
- Ok, I got it.
- He's got it. What you got?

38:24.636 --> 38:27.628
- A joke.
- You gonna give it to me?

38:27.847 --> 38:32.136
- Ask me how you become a bull rider.
- How do you become a bull rider?

38:32.352 --> 38:34.638
- That was good, Marshall.
- All right.

38:34.854 --> 38:37.891
- You get a handful of marbles.
- Ok.

38:38.107 --> 38:41.975
Get a handful of marbles,
you put them in your mouth, ok?

38:42.195 --> 38:44.311
Then you go to gilley's
and ride that bull.

38:44.531 --> 38:49.195
Every time you ride that bull, you take
one of them marbles and spit it out.

38:49.410 --> 38:50.946
- You're drunk.
- Isn't he cute?

38:51.162 --> 38:56.748
Ok. And when you've lost all your
marbles, that's when you're a bull rider.

38:56.960 --> 38:58.370
Shit!

38:58.586 --> 39:00.577
That's a good one.

39:02.799 --> 39:06.257
Don't worry about anything.
I'm sorry I didn't get to cryer,

39:06.469 --> 39:09.632
but I'll get to him
first thing in the morning.

39:09.848 --> 39:11.839
Let's get that burger.

39:14.811 --> 39:18.679
What the hell was that?
What's he tippin' his hat at you for?

39:19.858 --> 39:21.894
Don't he know we're married?

39:22.735 --> 39:24.726
Hey, tattoo! Lookee here! See this?

39:24.946 --> 39:28.359
That's a weddin' ring.
That means we're married. She's mine.

39:28.575 --> 39:30.566
- Don't be an asshole!
- Ok?

39:31.786 --> 39:35.995
- All right, loosen up.
- See that? He slipped me the finger.

39:36.207 --> 39:38.994
- Would you calm down?
- I didn't see him.

39:39.210 --> 39:41.201
Just calm down, bud.

39:42.130 --> 39:47.420
- Here's your food.
- Burger, extra onion. Ham and eggs.

39:47.635 --> 39:51.127
Cheese omelet.
And the chili of yours is coming.

39:53.933 --> 39:56.891
- This thing's still movin'.
- I can't help it.

39:57.103 --> 39:59.219
Well, then, put it back on the fire!

40:18.833 --> 40:20.744
Bud, don't do this. It's stupid.

40:20.960 --> 40:24.202
Don't fight him.
You're drunker than cooter brown.

40:24.881 --> 40:27.873
- Are you listening at all?
- Will you shut up? I mean it!

40:28.092 --> 40:29.753
Ok, fine!

40:32.639 --> 40:36.848
- Stop it!
- Let's get that burger now.

40:37.435 --> 40:38.766
Get him, bud!

40:39.312 --> 40:41.348
Goddammit! Bud, don't!

40:48.071 --> 40:50.107
Get outta here!

40:50.573 --> 40:52.609
Hold on.

40:53.660 --> 40:55.696
Hold on a second.

40:59.582 --> 41:00.697
Sissy, take him home.

41:04.295 --> 41:06.331
Bud?

41:07.090 --> 41:09.126
Bud, it's seven o'clock.

41:13.805 --> 41:16.888
If you're not goin' in to work,
I'll call you in sick.

41:18.351 --> 41:21.138
- Brought you some coffee.
- Get me a beer.

41:21.354 --> 41:24.721
- If they smell beer on your breath...
- Just get me a beer!

41:25.483 --> 41:26.893
Yes, sir.

41:34.534 --> 41:37.617
Sweetheart, are you sure
you're ok to go to work?

42:07.358 --> 42:09.394
- Hi, daddy.
- Morning, honey.

42:14.157 --> 42:16.193
If it's ok, I wanna get off early today.

42:16.409 --> 42:19.993
That's all right with me,
if your mother don't mind.

42:21.205 --> 42:25.995
- Ma, I wanna get off early today, ok?
- It's ok with me if it's ok with him.

42:26.210 --> 42:27.450
Guess it's ok.

42:35.845 --> 42:39.929
- Better eat something. You'll get sick.
- No, I'll be all right.

42:55.073 --> 42:57.735
- Hi, marshalene.
- Hi, sissy.

43:02.914 --> 43:04.950
Fine. You're ndin' fine.

43:08.586 --> 43:10.747
- Hi, y'all.
- Hi, sissy.

43:10.963 --> 43:13.204
- Hi, sissy.
- Remember Wes?

43:14.467 --> 43:19.712
He's livin' out back. Workin' here.
Gonna help me run the bull.

43:20.556 --> 43:23.138
Get on up and take a ride.

43:24.519 --> 43:25.519
Ok.

43:33.861 --> 43:39.356
Push, lift. Push, lift. All right. Turn
loose with that hand. Turn loose with it.

43:39.575 --> 43:43.193
Turn loose with it. All right.
Now stick it up in the air.

43:43.412 --> 43:47.701
- Up behind you. Turn your arm.
- Come on. Don't be scared.

43:57.218 --> 43:59.675
Hey, David.
Send me down some more mud.

44:00.555 --> 44:01.555
Ok.

44:19.157 --> 44:21.193
Good god almighty!

44:23.995 --> 44:26.111
Bud!

44:36.007 --> 44:37.292
Bud!

44:40.386 --> 44:44.220
- Ma'am, you are good!
- What are you grinnin' at?

44:44.432 --> 44:47.799
Turn to the left. Hit it. In the well.

44:48.019 --> 44:52.058
Get that arm back. You look fine.
You're a bull rider, child!

44:59.947 --> 45:02.108
Don't move, bud! Don't move!

45:03.701 --> 45:05.657
Arch your back, arch your back.

45:05.870 --> 45:07.781
Hang on, bud.

45:07.997 --> 45:09.237
Hang on.

45:10.791 --> 45:12.827
- I can't take it!
- Stop it!

45:24.931 --> 45:28.298
Take it easy. You'll be all right.
We'll get you down.

45:28.976 --> 45:31.012
You'll be all right.

45:33.022 --> 45:35.729
I'm gonna go get the crane.

45:41.572 --> 45:44.905
- How long you been married?
- Not very long at all.

45:46.452 --> 45:50.616
- How long?
- I don't know. About a week, I guess.

45:51.582 --> 45:55.700
All right. Just pretend
like you're still on your honeymoon.

46:18.985 --> 46:23.149
- Hi. Bob told me what happened.
- Well, come on in.

46:23.364 --> 46:25.901
- I came to check on you.
- Can I get you a drink?

46:26.117 --> 46:28.278
Shoot, no, darlin'.

46:28.494 --> 46:32.737
- How are you?
- Fine. They've given me this codeine.

46:32.957 --> 46:34.948
Yeah?

46:36.877 --> 46:40.961
- Where's sissy? Is she at work?
- Sissy. I'd better call her.

46:41.173 --> 46:46.167
If she finds out from somebody else
but me, she'll probably get worried.

46:50.558 --> 46:53.675
My god, bud. Y'all live like pigs.

47:10.745 --> 47:12.781
What's the matter?

47:13.539 --> 47:17.498
Nothin' much.
He just almost got himself killed.

47:17.710 --> 47:19.450
- Killed?
- That's right.

47:19.670 --> 47:21.661
- Where is he?
- He's in the tub.

47:22.256 --> 47:24.292
Bud?

47:25.009 --> 47:28.922
- Bud, what happened?
- I fell off the scaffold.

47:29.138 --> 47:31.595
- You're kiddin'.
- No. 200 feet in the air.

47:31.807 --> 47:34.048
Damn near broke my back.
Where you been?

47:34.268 --> 47:38.011
I was with Jessie.
I guess I forgot the time. You ok?

47:38.230 --> 47:43.975
Bud? Listen, darlin', I'm gonna
go home now that sissy's here. Ok?

47:44.195 --> 47:46.902
I couldn't get to this bathroom.
Maybe sissy can.

47:47.114 --> 47:48.775
Don't worry about that.

47:48.991 --> 47:53.280
I put some tuna salads
in the icebox for y'all, ok?

47:53.496 --> 47:58.331
If you need anything else, just call.
You know where we are.

47:58.542 --> 48:00.533
Bye-bye, sissy.

48:03.714 --> 48:06.797
Get me another beer.
I gotta soak longer.

48:07.009 --> 48:08.795
Ok.

48:28.948 --> 48:32.361
What was you and Jessie up to?
I thought you didn't like her.

48:32.576 --> 48:35.613
Jessie's all right. Just girl talk.

48:39.250 --> 48:42.242
I like my tuna salad
when it has pecans and apple,

48:42.461 --> 48:44.952
not so much of this onion.

48:45.172 --> 48:48.710
We don't have no pecans and apples
cos you ain't been shoppin'.

48:48.926 --> 48:51.713
Corene asked me what I wanted.
I said corn bread.

48:51.929 --> 48:56.047
- She couldn't even find any instant.
- Don't complain against me, bud.

48:56.267 --> 48:59.054
There's certain things
a man wants from his wife.

48:59.270 --> 49:03.388
Like to be here when he gets home and
to cook once in a while and clean up.

49:03.607 --> 49:05.598
Make good love to him.

49:07.486 --> 49:10.774
Look, I know that's good, ok?
But that ain't enough.

49:14.452 --> 49:16.989
I just thought we'd go to McDonald's.

49:17.204 --> 49:19.695
- Goddammit! McDonald's again?!
- I work, too!

49:19.915 --> 49:22.531
You're making out like
I have nothing to do all day!

49:22.751 --> 49:27.085
That's what I told her! I said
you worked! She said we live like pigs!

49:30.426 --> 49:32.462
She said that?

49:43.314 --> 49:46.147
Look, I don't wanna fight with you.

49:47.109 --> 49:49.566
Well, I don't wanna fight either.

49:53.449 --> 49:55.485
Wanna go to gilley's tonight?

49:56.660 --> 49:58.696
No.

50:01.749 --> 50:03.785
Come here. Come here.

50:07.630 --> 50:10.087
You mad at me?

50:16.597 --> 50:20.215
Come on, let's go to gilley's.
It'll make us feel better.

50:21.519 --> 50:24.306
- Ok.
- Go get dressed.

50:25.773 --> 50:28.981
- Eat your tuna with the onions.
- Clean up, pig!

50:57.221 --> 50:59.553
What the hell's he doin'
workin' the bull?

50:59.765 --> 51:03.553
- Steve gave him a job.
- How do you know that?

51:04.436 --> 51:07.473
- Jessie told me this afternoon.
- Sissy, come here!

51:07.690 --> 51:09.726
See you.

51:11.277 --> 51:12.892
How are you doin'?

51:13.112 --> 51:16.696
- I think you oughta ride.
- I can't. I got blisters on my ass.

51:16.907 --> 51:19.114
- Bud! How you feeling?
- All right.

51:19.326 --> 51:22.159
- How's that foot?
- It's my back that's killing me.

51:22.371 --> 51:26.284
- You scared the dickens out of us, boy.
- I thought I was a goner.

51:26.500 --> 51:30.243
- I ain't no chickenshit.
- Well, get your ass up there.

51:31.171 --> 51:34.208
- Wes, what's it on?
- Eight. I'll turn it down.

51:34.425 --> 51:36.416
Ok. I'm gonna ride.

51:42.349 --> 51:47.013
- Sure looks like he's feelin' good now.
- I'm on codeine. I don't feel a thing.

51:47.229 --> 51:50.471
- Girl on the bull!
- At least she won't hurt her balls!

51:50.691 --> 51:53.728
- There's gonna be a bull on a girl.
- Hear what they're sayin'?

51:53.944 --> 51:57.311
Look up there.
Bud, d'you recognize her?

51:57.531 --> 51:59.396
Hey, sissy! Get down from there!

51:59.617 --> 52:01.858
- Bud, just watch, ok?
- Right now!

52:02.077 --> 52:04.068
She knows what she's doin'.

52:06.915 --> 52:11.830
Remember, keep your hand in the well.
Don't think about nothin' but the ride.

52:12.046 --> 52:14.253
- Show 'em how to do it, girl.
- Ok.

52:15.132 --> 52:17.248
Turn that girl loose!

52:21.305 --> 52:23.967
Shit, bud!
She rides better than you do!

52:37.196 --> 52:40.654
- I wanted to show you I could ride it.
- You lied to me.

52:41.325 --> 52:45.113
I didn't lie. For Christ's sake,
I just wanted to ride the goddamn bull!

52:45.329 --> 52:48.287
Ok, tattoo. Let's see what you can do.

52:48.499 --> 52:51.707
- Jessie, turn it up!
- You can't ride that with your back!

52:51.919 --> 52:55.002
- Shut up!
- Ok, you're gonna hurt yourself.

52:55.214 --> 52:58.581
- Be careful, bud.
- I swear to god, take it easy.

53:03.514 --> 53:05.550
Shit!

53:22.950 --> 53:25.032
- That was a good ride.
- Now ride it.

53:25.244 --> 53:27.030
- I don't want to.
- Ride it!

53:27.246 --> 53:30.409
- Leave her alone, bud.
- Back off, Jessie! Ride it!

53:31.250 --> 53:33.411
Ok.

54:08.245 --> 54:10.281
That make you happy?

54:12.040 --> 54:16.750
Don't ride it again. Please?
Please don't ride it. You'll hurt yourself.

54:21.175 --> 54:25.088
- I'm gonna smack his ass this time.
- Take it easy.

54:28.724 --> 54:31.807
The bull's too fast. Easy!

54:34.104 --> 54:37.437
- You gotta stop him!
- Don't let this shit go too far.

54:49.578 --> 54:51.614
I've got him now.

55:03.884 --> 55:05.920
Bud!

55:12.810 --> 55:15.222
You broke my goddamn arm!

55:19.066 --> 55:21.102
Wes, you shit!

55:24.404 --> 55:26.440
Come on! Out the door!

55:44.508 --> 55:47.750
- You layin' him?
- I ain't layin' him.

55:50.848 --> 55:52.258
You lied to me.

55:52.474 --> 55:55.341
I was with Jessie.
I just didn't say where.

55:55.561 --> 56:00.146
My daddy told me if a woman'll lie about
one thing, she'll lie about another.

56:00.399 --> 56:03.391
- Bud, just take off your shirt.
- Get away from me!

56:03.610 --> 56:07.148
I don't need your help
and I don't want your help.

56:07.364 --> 56:09.605
I don't want you showin' off on that bull.

56:09.825 --> 56:13.488
- I wasn't showin' off!
- What the hell do you call it, then?

56:13.704 --> 56:16.366
- I call it riding it.
- Just riding it?

56:16.582 --> 56:19.699
That's right. And I'm gonna ride it again,
as much as I want to!

56:19.918 --> 56:23.877
- You think you are, but you ain't.
- You're not my daddy!

56:24.089 --> 56:28.583
I'm the next best thing - your husband.
You ain't never riding it, ever!

56:31.513 --> 56:33.799
I think you're jealous
cos I ride it better.

56:34.016 --> 56:35.631
- I'm what?
- Bud!

56:35.851 --> 56:38.058
You hit me!

56:38.228 --> 56:40.719
Cut it out! Stop it!

56:40.939 --> 56:43.521
- Come on! Get out!
- Where am I gonna go?!

56:43.734 --> 56:46.146
Go see your daddy!
You like him better!

56:49.072 --> 56:51.108
- Here! Take your keys!
- Fine!

56:53.243 --> 56:55.279
Goddammit!

57:08.008 --> 57:13.298
I'll be up front. I'm better with one arm
than most of your guys are with two.

57:13.513 --> 57:15.253
I'll guarantee that.

57:15.474 --> 57:19.183
I'm sorry, bud. There's not much
you can do here with a broken arm.

57:19.394 --> 57:24.354
And you're still on a probation period.
I can't keep you on a salary.

57:24.566 --> 57:28.229
Come back when the cast is off
and I'll put you back to work.

57:29.905 --> 57:32.897
Here's your severance pay.
And I am sorry, bud.

57:33.951 --> 57:35.987
Thank you.

59:37.866 --> 59:39.982
Bud, don't start no shit in here.

59:52.089 --> 59:56.173
She oughta be able to hang on
with those thunder thighs.

59:57.260 --> 59:59.125
- Ever done this before?
- No.

59:59.346 --> 01:00:03.840
Don't worry, honey. Anything
he makes sore, I'll be glad to kiss.

01:00:11.191 --> 01:00:13.307
I'll get y'all more beer.

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:23.696
Sissy! Just listen to me. Now, look,
that guy's an escaped convict.

01:00:23.912 --> 01:00:26.870
- He is not.
- He's in the prison rodeo program.

01:00:27.082 --> 01:00:29.789
- That guy's a convict.
- He's out on parole.

01:00:30.502 --> 01:00:35.041
- Wait a minute. You knew that?
- He told me today. I ain't talking to you.

01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:39.211
Fine. I'll find somebody else
who will talk to me.

01:00:39.427 --> 01:00:41.839
- Fine. Good luck.
- Good.

01:00:47.727 --> 01:00:52.687
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to
gilley's, the world's largest nightclub.

01:00:55.777 --> 01:00:57.768
Wanna dance?

01:00:57.988 --> 01:00:59.979
Sure. Why not?

01:01:16.131 --> 01:01:18.167
- You all right?
- No.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.636
Can I help?

01:01:31.188 --> 01:01:33.520
- Wanna dance?
- Why, sure.

01:01:33.732 --> 01:01:35.518
Ok.

01:03:28.054 --> 01:03:30.887
So when are you gonna
take me home and rape me?

01:03:32.058 --> 01:03:35.391
- Whenever you get ready.
- I'm ready right now.

01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:38.310
Come on.

01:03:39.482 --> 01:03:41.939
I gotta tell my girlfriends I'm goin...

01:03:43.486 --> 01:03:45.852
Got myself a cowboy. See y'all later.

01:03:47.115 --> 01:03:48.946
Bud!

01:03:51.077 --> 01:03:53.284
Bud!

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:58.328
Bud! Bud, where are you goin'?

01:04:00.628 --> 01:04:02.619
You bitch!

01:04:02.839 --> 01:04:04.875
Who's that?

01:04:05.592 --> 01:04:07.628
My wife.

01:04:08.261 --> 01:04:10.297
Hey, what's your problem?

01:04:22.359 --> 01:04:24.190
- What's your name?
- Bud.

01:04:26.863 --> 01:04:29.275
Mine's Pam.

01:04:29.491 --> 01:04:32.073
- Well, where are we goin', Pam?
- Uptown.

01:04:32.911 --> 01:04:37.200
Hey, cowboy. You're not just doin' this
to make your wife jealous, are you?

01:04:37.415 --> 01:04:39.622
Yep.

01:04:44.923 --> 01:04:46.959
I have a thing about cowboys.

01:04:48.093 --> 01:04:52.211
Just drives my daddy crazy.
He can't understand it.

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:56.928
I told him "daddy, most men today
are just too complicated."

01:04:57.143 --> 01:05:02.228
Daddy goes to an analyst three times
a week. I like men with simple values.

01:05:03.441 --> 01:05:06.524
I like them independent, self-reliant,

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:09.440
brave, strong,

01:05:10.365 --> 01:05:12.401
direct and open.

01:05:12.951 --> 01:05:14.987
"You mean dumb" he says.

01:05:16.496 --> 01:05:18.532
Daddy's a real scream.

01:05:19.999 --> 01:05:23.617
There's plenty of whiskey.
Pour me some bourbon.

01:05:23.837 --> 01:05:25.828
I'm gonna put some music on.

01:05:28.091 --> 01:05:30.457
What does your daddy do?

01:05:31.469 --> 01:05:34.757
Daddy does oil.
And all that that implies.

01:05:40.061 --> 01:05:42.473
- You come to Houston proper much?
- No.

01:05:44.399 --> 01:05:47.061
It's my favorite city
in the whole world.

01:05:48.319 --> 01:05:50.605
It's just got so much energy.

01:06:07.255 --> 01:06:09.917
To cowboys.

01:06:10.133 --> 01:06:12.124
And all that that implies.

01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:41.737
Come on.
I wanna show you something.

01:07:12.195 --> 01:07:17.189
This stuff is called mezcal con gusano,
which means "mezcal with worm".

01:07:18.243 --> 01:07:23.033
- It's got a worm in there?
- Yeah. A little worm floatin' around.

01:07:23.248 --> 01:07:24.954
It's sickening.

01:07:25.166 --> 01:07:30.081
The Mexicans say if you eat the worm,
you're gonna see visions.

01:07:31.506 --> 01:07:34.339
- Visions of what?
- I don't know.

01:07:35.218 --> 01:07:39.837
I ate a whole mess of 'em and I never
seen a vision yet, but I sure feel good.

01:07:41.516 --> 01:07:43.552
Well, what's that to?

01:07:44.811 --> 01:07:47.427
La vida Luna. "The crazy life."

01:07:48.773 --> 01:07:50.855
Ok.

01:07:57.865 --> 01:08:00.322
You Rob banks?

01:08:00.535 --> 01:08:02.776
I mean, Steve told me that.

01:08:03.329 --> 01:08:05.320
How many banks you Rob?

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:08.953
I don't really care how many
banks you robbed, but why?

01:08:10.295 --> 01:08:14.208
- Come here.
- I am right here. It's so small.

01:08:15.341 --> 01:08:17.877
No, you ain't. Come here.

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:21.298
Ok.

01:08:29.272 --> 01:08:31.354
Come here.

01:08:32.774 --> 01:08:34.810
Ok.

01:08:39.823 --> 01:08:41.859
This is my favorite thing.

01:09:16.194 --> 01:09:19.607
See, the thing is, I can't do this to bud.

01:09:21.032 --> 01:09:24.149
But I really appreciate
that thing with the worm.

01:09:24.868 --> 01:09:27.326
I thought I could, but I can't.

01:09:30.832 --> 01:09:33.198
I really loved that worm and all that.

01:12:43.818 --> 01:12:45.854
Wes?

01:13:06.883 --> 01:13:08.919
Hi, cowboy.

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:14.132
It didn't take much to find you.
I just called gilley's.

01:13:15.433 --> 01:13:20.393
One of the girls who works in the office
said she'd been here a couple of times.

01:13:20.605 --> 01:13:22.596
Thought I'd come.

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:25.936
Make your wife jealous again.

01:13:27.862 --> 01:13:33.357
Well, my wife is livin'
in a trailer outside gilley's

01:13:33.576 --> 01:13:35.612
with an ex-convict.

01:13:35.828 --> 01:13:37.819
And I'm gettin' a divorce.

01:13:45.171 --> 01:13:47.002
Shit.

01:13:48.132 --> 01:13:49.588
Hello?

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:51.631
Hi, uncle Bob.

01:13:51.844 --> 01:13:53.835
Yeah. No, that's all right.

01:13:55.848 --> 01:13:57.884
No, I got company.

01:13:59.143 --> 01:14:01.134
No, it ain't sissy.

01:14:02.396 --> 01:14:05.308
Well, no, we're not really hungry, but...

01:14:07.818 --> 01:14:11.106
Well, that sounds good.
Hold on. I'll ask her.

01:14:11.322 --> 01:14:15.156
It's my uncle Bob. My aunt corene
just made a homemade karo nut pie,

01:14:15.368 --> 01:14:17.734
and we'll go over for dessert.

01:14:17.954 --> 01:14:19.364
We'd love to.

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:21.571
Well, at least a couple of hours.

01:14:22.667 --> 01:14:24.703
All right, see you then. Bye.

01:14:40.393 --> 01:14:42.384
This pie is so good.

01:14:42.603 --> 01:14:47.768
Corene found this while she was goin'
through some old boxes the other day.

01:14:50.027 --> 01:14:52.484
I won that for bull-ridin' in '64.

01:14:52.697 --> 01:14:55.063
I didn't know you won first place.

01:14:55.282 --> 01:14:57.273
Look at that.

01:14:57.493 --> 01:15:00.860
You'd have been better than
Larry mahan, if not for that accident.

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:06.040
- He was in hospital for nearly a year.
- I fell off and the bull stomped me.

01:15:06.252 --> 01:15:11.417
I got a plastic bone in my leg and
a plastic plate up here in my head.

01:15:11.632 --> 01:15:15.420
- How well d'you know this pretty lady?
- Go ahead. Tell her.

01:15:15.636 --> 01:15:17.627
One plastic nut.

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:22.507
He bullshits a lot,
but he's tellin' the truth.

01:15:22.727 --> 01:15:27.812
We're goin' to gilley's tonight. Be
the first time since we took you there.

01:15:29.859 --> 01:15:32.851
- Y'all come with us.
- Why? What's happenin' out there?

01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:36.858
They are having
a Dolly parton lookalike contest.

01:15:38.826 --> 01:15:40.942
Lord have mercy!

01:15:41.162 --> 01:15:46.122
Evening, ladies and gentlemen.
These are our Dolly parton lookalikes.

01:15:48.044 --> 01:15:50.410

01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:57.125

01:15:58.429 --> 01:16:00.044
Hi. I'm chrystal Smith.

01:16:01.599 --> 01:16:07.139
- Hi. I'm marshalene Mitchell.
- Hi. I'm Sandra carmush.

01:16:07.354 --> 01:16:10.596

- Big round of applause for our finalists!

01:16:21.994 --> 01:16:24.656
Now could we have
the decision from our judges?

01:16:24.872 --> 01:16:26.237
Thank you.

01:16:26.457 --> 01:16:28.664
Miss Sandra carmush!

01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:38.461
Eat your heart out.

01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:41.927
Congratulations! Ain't she a Dolly?

01:16:44.475 --> 01:16:49.219
For all you shitkickers out there,
it's rodeo time again here at gilley's.

01:16:49.438 --> 01:16:53.477
And we're gonna have
our own indoor rodeo back there.

01:16:55.194 --> 01:16:57.276
That's just three weeks from tonight.

01:16:57.488 --> 01:16:59.854
We're gonna have a bull-riding contest,

01:17:00.074 --> 01:17:03.532
a punching-bag contest
and a dancing contest.

01:17:03.744 --> 01:17:06.531
For all you guys that wanna ride
that mechanical bull,

01:17:06.747 --> 01:17:11.491
we got a table set up for all you guys
that wanna join, or even you cowgirls.

01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:15.999
The entry forms are back there.
It's $10 per person, per event.

01:17:16.215 --> 01:17:18.581
So join up
and have a good time with us.

01:17:18.801 --> 01:17:22.919
Right now we're gonna have
a little music. "Cotton-eyed Joe"!

01:17:25.099 --> 01:17:27.135
I really wanted to win.

01:17:29.353 --> 01:17:31.890
You were the prettiest one there!

01:17:32.106 --> 01:17:36.645
Let's go and look at that machine.
I wanna see what kind of machine it is.

01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:49.157
- You wanna ride this thing?
- Yeah.

01:18:18.152 --> 01:18:21.986
It's just an old ei toro.
I trained on one when I was rodeoin'.

01:18:23.365 --> 01:18:25.572
Real good, Norman.

01:18:25.784 --> 01:18:28.275
- I wanna ride it.
- All right. Come on.

01:18:56.398 --> 01:18:59.105
Look at that. Her nipples are hard!

01:18:59.318 --> 01:19:02.936
- Come on, sissy! Do your stuff!
- She ain't got no glove on.

01:19:03.155 --> 01:19:04.986
She don't need one for this.

01:19:14.708 --> 01:19:18.701
Hell, she rides better
without a glove than I do with one.

01:19:24.969 --> 01:19:28.052
That's better than a vibrator, ain't it?

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:37.762
All right! Come on, sissy! Go!

01:19:40.192 --> 01:19:42.228
Come on!

01:19:44.238 --> 01:19:46.980
She's all right, I guess.
I've seen better.

01:20:03.924 --> 01:20:05.960
Come on, sissy! Go!

01:20:12.391 --> 01:20:14.848
Let's go. Come on, let's go.

01:20:18.772 --> 01:20:21.104
You sure made bud jealous.

01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:26.523
Listen, y'all, I think maybe
we better call it a night.

01:20:26.739 --> 01:20:31.108
Hell, no! I'm just ready to party. Let's
go to that place you was talkin' about.

01:20:31.327 --> 01:20:35.787
- Elan's?
- I can't go anyplace dressed like this!

01:20:35.998 --> 01:20:39.661
- She can go like that, can't she?
- I know a place where it won't matter.

01:20:39.877 --> 01:20:43.290
What the hell!
Pop them titties and let's get rollin'.

01:20:43.505 --> 01:20:45.837
All right. Here goes!

01:20:53.891 --> 01:20:57.554
- Hey, Carol!
- Hi, Pam. How you doin'?

01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:59.726
- Hello, Pam.
- Hey, Earl.

01:20:59.938 --> 01:21:04.477
Could you help me ride that buck?
Good enough to kick ass in that rodeo?

01:21:04.693 --> 01:21:06.524
Why, hell, yeah!

01:21:06.737 --> 01:21:11.106
There used to be a machine at the
circle eight I trained on for rodeoin'.

01:21:11.325 --> 01:21:13.737
- Think we could use it?
- I imagine.

01:21:13.952 --> 01:21:16.785
How long you think it'd be
till I get good enough to win?

01:21:16.997 --> 01:21:20.205
- When's that cast comin' off?
- Next week.

01:21:20.417 --> 01:21:23.329
- Let's go out tomorrow and look at it.
- Hell, yes!

01:21:23.545 --> 01:21:25.285
All right!

01:21:25.506 --> 01:21:30.216
- Three Jack Daniel's!
- Two. I'm having bourbon and coke.

01:22:51.633 --> 01:22:57.299
Bud, in some ways, a bull like this
is harder to ride than a real one.

01:22:57.514 --> 01:23:01.757
With a real one, you can watch his head
and see which way he's apt to move.

01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:07.347
With one of these, the treachery of the
bull depends on the man operating it.

01:23:23.957 --> 01:23:27.449
If you wanna ride it right,
you gotta learn style and form,

01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:32.254
because you're competing against real
bull riders, not just mechanical ones.

01:23:32.466 --> 01:23:36.880
I can tell you how to score points.
I can't show you because I'm too fat!

01:23:37.095 --> 01:23:40.929
If you listen to me, you can win.
If you don't, you won't. Ok?

01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:06.621
Bud?

01:24:12.798 --> 01:24:14.959
Bud?

01:24:15.342 --> 01:24:18.334
That's it! Yeah! Keep kicking!

01:24:18.554 --> 01:24:21.170
That's what you're gonna be
judged on - your style.

01:24:21.390 --> 01:24:24.132
Good! Good! Yeah!

01:24:24.351 --> 01:24:28.469
You gotta do more than stay on
to win a rodeo. You gotta have flair!

01:24:28.689 --> 01:24:33.683
- Kick it! Keep that hand up!
- That's better?

01:24:35.112 --> 01:24:38.229
"Dear bud, sorry about last night."

01:24:38.448 --> 01:24:42.782
"I was kind of drunk...
Well I was drunk."

01:24:43.829 --> 01:24:47.037
"I woke up feelin' awful
about life and other stuff.”

01:24:50.252 --> 01:24:53.244
"Maybe we could be friends again.”

01:24:53.463 --> 01:24:55.454
"Maybe more."

01:24:57.759 --> 01:25:00.216
"I didn't even mind cleanin' up much.”

01:25:01.346 --> 01:25:04.759
"I didn't even mind cleanin' up... much.”

01:25:07.144 --> 01:25:11.057
"If you want to call me,
I'll wait at gilley's all afternoon.”

01:25:14.484 --> 01:25:16.520
"Bye."

01:25:19.031 --> 01:25:22.865
"Love, your not-yet-ex-wife, sissy."

01:25:23.785 --> 01:25:25.821
"Ps n

01:25:30.834 --> 01:25:32.540
"Ps n

01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:37.003
"I miss you."

01:26:08.914 --> 01:26:10.950
Bud?

01:26:13.919 --> 01:26:17.662
- I was just leavin'.
- Good.

01:26:38.610 --> 01:26:41.568
Hi. How'd you get in?

01:26:41.988 --> 01:26:44.024
The door was open.

01:26:45.492 --> 01:26:50.361
What did you do?
Damn! You cleaned up the place.

01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:52.491
All right!

01:26:52.708 --> 01:26:55.541
The bathroom, bedroom.

01:26:55.752 --> 01:26:57.708
Flowers!

01:26:57.921 --> 01:27:01.914
This is great! I just love
a woman's touch around the house.

01:27:02.134 --> 01:27:04.125
I mean it.

01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:27.823
What are you doing with yourself now?

01:27:28.034 --> 01:27:30.741
Doc told me this cast
could come off first of the week.

01:27:30.954 --> 01:27:34.196
Thought I'd take it off a day early.
Save some money.

01:27:36.001 --> 01:27:38.743
Look, I ain't got
your kind of money, right?

01:27:41.089 --> 01:27:43.125
Every little bit helps.

01:27:44.551 --> 01:27:50.797
Uncle Bob told me if I work a double
shift, I can make up to $16 an hour.

01:27:51.016 --> 01:27:55.350
How d'you like that? Turn that up.
That's my favorite song.

01:27:55.562 --> 01:27:57.928
I didn't realize you made
so much at the plant.

01:27:58.523 --> 01:28:02.311
Hell, yeah. How come you think
I came to Houston? For my health?

01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:07.608
What you do is this: Come to Houston,

01:28:07.824 --> 01:28:09.940
make some extra money,

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:13.118
then you go back home
and get yourself a piece of land.

01:28:13.330 --> 01:28:16.163
Course, with the high cost
of livin' and...

01:28:17.667 --> 01:28:22.036
All the things I've been through lately,
I haven't been able to save a dime.

01:28:27.052 --> 01:28:30.260
Pam? I said turn it up.
I can't hardly hear it.

01:28:32.599 --> 01:28:36.057
- What are you doin'?
- Nothin ". Just listenin".

01:28:39.773 --> 01:28:43.311
I never met a cowboy who didn't talk
about going back to the country.

01:28:43.527 --> 01:28:47.145
Yeah, well, I guess
it's all bullshit anyway.

01:28:49.825 --> 01:28:53.113
Course, if I won that rodeo,
it could all come true.

01:28:58.667 --> 01:29:00.658
Bud?

01:29:00.877 --> 01:29:02.242
What?

01:29:02.462 --> 01:29:06.421
I'm gonna bring some clothes here
and stay with you for a while.

01:29:06.633 --> 01:29:09.500
You need a woman
to take care of you. All right?

01:29:11.555 --> 01:29:13.591
Suit yourself.

01:29:20.522 --> 01:29:23.059
Marshalene?

01:29:23.275 --> 01:29:25.391
Bud still hasn't called?

01:29:25.610 --> 01:29:27.817
No, he hasn't.

01:29:28.029 --> 01:29:31.271
I'm gonna go back inside,
so you know where I am.

01:29:31.992 --> 01:29:33.607
Ok.

01:31:03.792 --> 01:31:08.286
Hey, bud!
Want somethin' to eat? Drink?

01:31:09.631 --> 01:31:11.462
Ok.

01:32:02.726 --> 01:32:06.969
- Damn good! Damn good, bud!
- Thanks, Dwight.

01:32:07.188 --> 01:32:12.933
Now go out and hang around gilley's
and watch that fellow run that bull.

01:32:13.153 --> 01:32:15.064
That sounds like a good idea.

01:33:17.175 --> 01:33:19.211
Wes?

01:33:31.356 --> 01:33:34.098
Home a little early, ain't you?

01:33:34.317 --> 01:33:35.807
No.

01:33:57.006 --> 01:33:59.668
Marshalene was just leavin'.

01:34:14.524 --> 01:34:18.642
- Excuse me. I'm sorry, sissy.
- Don't matter. See you later.

01:34:27.078 --> 01:34:30.570
You can't expect a man like me
to be faithful to any woman.

01:34:50.268 --> 01:34:52.304
You buy cigarettes?

01:35:02.530 --> 01:35:04.737
Pick it up.

01:35:04.949 --> 01:35:07.065
Pick it up yourself.

01:35:08.203 --> 01:35:09.203
No!

01:35:09.412 --> 01:35:11.323
Pick it up.

01:35:23.426 --> 01:35:25.462
Pick it up.

01:35:26.471 --> 01:35:28.507
Thank you.

01:35:29.182 --> 01:35:31.218
Fix me something to eat.

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:34.175
Fix it yourself.

01:35:35.396 --> 01:35:37.432
Fix me somethin' to eat!

01:35:58.086 --> 01:36:00.122
Gonna storm.

01:36:01.673 --> 01:36:04.130
- Howdy.
- Hi.

01:36:05.093 --> 01:36:08.585
- Where you been?
- Circle eight with uncle Bob.

01:36:08.805 --> 01:36:10.796
Rode that bull up to ten today.

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:15.387
- What's that? It smells good.
- Stroganoff.

01:36:17.563 --> 01:36:21.772
There's a party later tonight at cowboy
for some friends of mine.

01:36:22.944 --> 01:36:24.980
My daddy might go.

01:36:25.905 --> 01:36:29.523
You go on ahead. I'm gonna work
the graveyard shift tonight.

01:36:31.869 --> 01:36:33.905
Again?

01:36:37.792 --> 01:36:40.249
Pays time and a half. I've got to.

01:36:49.095 --> 01:36:53.304
I'm gonna take a nap.
Wake me up in an hour and a half.

01:36:55.643 --> 01:36:58.225
I'm goin' to watch
that son of a bitch run that bull.

01:36:58.438 --> 01:37:01.305
And then I'm goin' right to work,
so don't forget.

01:37:04.736 --> 01:37:07.728
- Aren't you hungry?
- No. I'll eat when I get up.

01:37:25.798 --> 01:37:28.631
I don't want you to go
to gilley's without me.

01:37:29.969 --> 01:37:32.881
I gotta watch the man's technique.

01:37:34.182 --> 01:37:36.594
Ok. I'll go.

01:37:39.354 --> 01:37:41.390
I'll just go to cowboy later.

01:37:43.524 --> 01:37:47.267
You don't care if I go to the party?
You won't be jealous?

01:37:47.904 --> 01:37:49.144
Nope.

01:37:49.364 --> 01:37:51.355
Not even a little?

01:37:52.492 --> 01:37:57.361
Look, I hope I learned a lesson
about being jealous from sissy.

01:37:57.580 --> 01:38:00.868
I hope I'm the kind of a man
who can learn from experience.

01:38:01.084 --> 01:38:03.541
Not everybody does.

01:38:03.753 --> 01:38:07.291
Contrary to what you or your daddy
think, all cowboys ain't dumb.

01:38:07.507 --> 01:38:10.419
Some of them got the smarts
real good. Like me.

01:38:10.635 --> 01:38:12.216
I'm sure.

01:38:14.931 --> 01:38:18.298
- What have you done now?
- What are you talkin' about?

01:38:20.186 --> 01:38:22.222
You bought me another shirt.

01:38:24.190 --> 01:38:26.476
You are crazy, girl!

01:38:29.529 --> 01:38:32.316
I had that one made
for you, sweetheart.

01:38:33.449 --> 01:38:36.612
Thank you. It's real nice.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.706
Uncle Bob!

01:38:44.919 --> 01:38:46.784
- Hey, bud!
- How you feelin'?

01:38:47.004 --> 01:38:50.667
Real good. You stop off at gilley's
on the way over here?

01:38:50.883 --> 01:38:56.003
No. I wanted to, but Pam
didn't wake me up on time.

01:38:56.222 --> 01:38:58.838
I was so goddamn mad, I tell you.

01:39:00.059 --> 01:39:03.643
I guess she just don't want me
bein' where sissy is or somethin'.

01:39:03.855 --> 01:39:05.811
Yeah.

01:39:06.023 --> 01:39:08.560
- I saw sissy today.
- Yeah?

01:39:08.776 --> 01:39:11.438
- What did she say?
- Well, not very much.

01:39:11.654 --> 01:39:14.316
She gave me the finger.
I gave her the finger.

01:39:14.532 --> 01:39:17.148
Well... I guess it's over. I don't know.

01:39:18.494 --> 01:39:23.284
You know, bud, sometimes even
a cowboy's gotta swallow his pride

01:39:23.499 --> 01:39:25.490
and hold on to somebody he loves.

01:39:26.627 --> 01:39:28.618
- What do you mean?
- Hell, I know.

01:39:28.838 --> 01:39:33.377
I pretty near lost corene and the kids
a couple of times just cos of pride.

01:39:33.593 --> 01:39:38.257
You think that old pride is gonna
choke you goin' down but, I tell you,

01:39:39.223 --> 01:39:44.138
ain't a night goes by I don't thank the
boss for givin' me a big enough throat.

01:39:45.521 --> 01:39:50.481
Without corene and them kids, I'd just
be a pile of shit in a cantaloupe patch,

01:39:50.693 --> 01:39:52.684
just drawin" flies!

01:39:53.779 --> 01:39:56.566
- I guess so.
- Think about it, bud.

01:39:56.782 --> 01:40:00.366
Pride's one of them seven deadlies,
you know what I mean?

01:40:02.538 --> 01:40:04.153
- Bob?
- Yes, sir?

01:40:04.373 --> 01:40:07.365
- Check 309 and Gauge it for me.
- You betcha!

01:40:07.585 --> 01:40:10.122
Thanks, partner.
You boys go and help bud.

01:40:10.338 --> 01:40:12.750
What are you guys doin' here?

01:40:12.965 --> 01:40:15.627
- Freezin', bud!
- Come to help me?

01:40:15.843 --> 01:40:19.085
They called a bunch of us out.
Said it's gonna rain tonight.

01:40:19.305 --> 01:40:23.218
That's good, cos I thought I was
gonna do this all alone. Help me.

01:40:28.648 --> 01:40:31.390
Goddamn! I hate that lightning!

01:40:31.609 --> 01:40:33.600
Mudder, four inch by ninety.

01:40:39.116 --> 01:40:41.198
Goddamn!

01:40:42.370 --> 01:40:44.406
Shit!

01:40:53.256 --> 01:40:55.838
- Uncle Bob!
- Get the hell outta there!

01:40:56.133 --> 01:40:58.875
- Bud!
- Get down!

01:40:59.095 --> 01:41:02.713
- Move back!
- Get outta here! Go on!

01:41:02.932 --> 01:41:04.923
Get back!

01:41:05.685 --> 01:41:07.721
Get him back!

01:41:23.286 --> 01:41:25.698
Let us pray.

01:41:25.913 --> 01:41:30.407
Our father, which art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name,

01:41:30.626 --> 01:41:33.038
thy kingdom come,
thy will be done,

01:41:33.254 --> 01:41:36.496
on earth as it is in heaven.

01:41:36.716 --> 01:41:40.925
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses,

01:41:41.137 --> 01:41:44.470
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

01:41:44.682 --> 01:41:48.391
Lead us not into temptation,
deliver us from evil,

01:41:48.603 --> 01:41:50.969
for thine is the kingdom,
the power and the glory,

01:41:51.188 --> 01:41:53.429
for ever and ever. Amen.

01:42:07.371 --> 01:42:08.827
Thank you, pallbearers.

01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:12.373
Take your boutonnieres
and place them on the casket.

01:42:47.953 --> 01:42:49.864
Aunt corene.

01:42:50.081 --> 01:42:51.412
Sissy.

01:42:51.624 --> 01:42:53.831
- I'm so sorry.
- Sweetheart.

01:42:54.043 --> 01:42:57.831
- Nobody called me or nothin'.
- Thanks so much for coming.

01:43:01.801 --> 01:43:04.167
- I loved uncle Bob.
- I know you did, darlin'.

01:43:04.387 --> 01:43:08.050
- Bob loved you, too. You know that.
- Come on, mamma.

01:43:09.183 --> 01:43:11.174
Take care.

01:43:13.396 --> 01:43:16.980
- Thanks for coming.
- He was my uncle, too.

01:43:17.191 --> 01:43:19.182
I mean, he still is by marriage.

01:43:20.236 --> 01:43:22.272
Our divorce ain't final yet.

01:43:23.239 --> 01:43:28.700
I just... you know, I wasn't able
to get to the papers, so...

01:43:28.911 --> 01:43:30.902
Doesn't matter.

01:43:33.332 --> 01:43:36.540
Uncle Bob really wanted
you to be happy. You happy?

01:43:37.753 --> 01:43:40.495
Hell, yes, I'm happy.
How about you? You happy?

01:43:40.715 --> 01:43:43.457
Shit. Yeah, I really am.

01:43:43.676 --> 01:43:46.634
I finally got what I wanted.
I got a real cowboy.

01:43:48.514 --> 01:43:51.221
I got what I wanted, too.
I got myself a real lady.

01:43:51.434 --> 01:43:55.268
- Bud, the family car is waiting.
- Family car is waitin'.

01:43:56.439 --> 01:43:59.146
I ain't gonna be here after tonight.

01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:05.228
Wes... there just ain't much life
for us here, and he can't get a job.

01:44:05.448 --> 01:44:09.566
He's gonna win that rodeo tonight.
We're gonna take off.

01:44:10.369 --> 01:44:12.155
That sounds real good.

01:44:12.371 --> 01:44:16.080
"Cept how's he plannin' to win
the rodeo when he's runnin' the bull?

01:44:16.292 --> 01:44:20.285
He ain't. Sherwood fired his ass
cos he's hurtin' too many people.

01:44:20.504 --> 01:44:24.497
Purse is up to $5,000. Wes says
that'll get us deep into Mexico.

01:44:25.926 --> 01:44:28.884
- Don't suppose you'll be there tonight.
- No.

01:44:29.346 --> 01:44:31.587
No.

01:44:31.807 --> 01:44:33.763
Bye, y'all.

01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:44.145
Bye, Pam.

01:45:48.384 --> 01:45:51.046
I've got somethin' for you, darlin.

01:45:52.263 --> 01:45:57.383
Bob told me just last Monday night,
just right before he went to bed that...

01:45:57.601 --> 01:46:02.345
He wanted you to have this and to wear
it tonight at the rodeo, for good luck.

01:46:08.112 --> 01:46:11.479
Well, I ain't goin' to the rodeo tonight.

01:46:11.699 --> 01:46:13.610
I don't feel like I can.

01:46:16.078 --> 01:46:20.617
Please take it, Bob... bud!
Listen to that.

01:46:28.549 --> 01:46:32.667
You take that.
You take it tonight for good luck.

01:46:32.887 --> 01:46:36.926
I'll take it. I'd be proud to own it.

01:46:37.141 --> 01:46:41.180
But not for tonight, not for good luck.

01:46:46.650 --> 01:46:52.771
You know... Bob kind of forgot about
his rodeo days till you come along.

01:46:52.990 --> 01:46:57.825
And... he even forgot
where he put that belt buckle.

01:46:58.037 --> 01:47:01.279
- I had a hell of a time findin' it.
- I bet you did.

01:47:02.666 --> 01:47:07.831
Now that it's turned up again,
I don't want it retired.

01:47:08.047 --> 01:47:10.914
I wanna give it to somebody
who's gonna use it.

01:49:42.743 --> 01:49:45.701
All right. Welcome to gilley's rodeo!

01:49:48.874 --> 01:49:52.207
We got a couple of clowns here.
Couple of real funny bones.

01:49:52.419 --> 01:49:55.502
Give them a hand, too.
All right? Yeah! Ok!

01:49:55.714 --> 01:50:01.584
Folks, this rodeo is gonna be run just
like any rodeo right across this country.

01:50:01.804 --> 01:50:03.340
The same way.

01:50:03.555 --> 01:50:09.676
Now, each judge is gonna give
1 to 25 points for the bull,

01:50:09.895 --> 01:50:12.557
1 to 25 points for the rider,

01:50:12.773 --> 01:50:16.607
for a combined possible score
of 100 points.

01:50:17.069 --> 01:50:22.939
Now, the five top contestants are gonna
compete in the short go-round,

01:50:23.158 --> 01:50:26.616
and we're gonna combine the scores
on this ride and that ride,

01:50:26.829 --> 01:50:31.072
and out of that we're gonna have
the winner of that $5,000 jackpot!

01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:36.919

Give him a ride, Sam.

01:52:45.634 --> 01:52:49.843
Hell. Some gotta win
and some gotta lose.

01:52:50.055 --> 01:52:52.762
If the bull don't kill him,
the clowns will!

01:52:59.856 --> 01:53:02.347

02:03:05.295 --> 02:03:07.331
Pack that shit!

02:03:49.464 --> 02:03:52.297
Leave the motor running.
I'll be right back.

02:03:54.052 --> 02:03:57.169
Welcome! Good to have all you folks
at gilley's annual rodeo.

02:03:57.388 --> 02:04:01.927
At this time I would like to announce
the winners of all three big events.

02:04:09.442 --> 02:04:13.902
First of all, I want to introduce
the judges of our dance contest.

02:04:14.113 --> 02:04:16.069
Becky tiller and the top dj...

02:04:16.282 --> 02:04:18.238
Do you think sissy left?

02:04:19.327 --> 02:04:22.535
I know she did.
She went out the side door.

02:04:22.747 --> 02:04:25.238
Shit! I wanted her to see this.

02:04:25.458 --> 02:04:28.074
That would have been perfect. Perfect.

02:04:33.216 --> 02:04:36.925
The punching-bag event,
the strong man of the bunch:

02:04:37.136 --> 02:04:39.377
Norman Tucker!

02:04:45.561 --> 02:04:47.802
Congratulations, Norman!

02:04:49.273 --> 02:04:51.104
Now for the really big event.

02:04:51.317 --> 02:04:54.275
The gentleman that outrode
everybody on our famous bull,

02:04:54.487 --> 02:04:57.524
the one and only... bud Davis!

02:05:08.292 --> 02:05:10.328
Congratulations to bud!

02:05:12.797 --> 02:05:14.503
Back to that good country music.

02:05:14.716 --> 02:05:19.085
The Charlie Daniels band,
"the orange blossom special"!

02:05:19.303 --> 02:05:22.466
We'd better go. I don't wanna leave
aunt corene alone too long.

02:05:22.682 --> 02:05:24.843
- You did it for her, didn't you?
- What?

02:05:25.059 --> 02:05:27.516
Practicing. Winning. All that.

02:05:27.729 --> 02:05:30.266
- Didn't you?
- What are you talkin' about?

02:05:30.481 --> 02:05:32.437
Cos you sure didn't do it for me.

02:05:36.070 --> 02:05:39.107
Pam, this ain't no time
to start this with me.

02:05:39.323 --> 02:05:41.234
What are you talkin' about?

02:05:41.451 --> 02:05:45.114
Look, I'm a shit.
But I'm not that big a shit.

02:05:45.329 --> 02:05:47.285
I have to tell you something.

02:05:47.498 --> 02:05:51.616
Remember when you came back and
the trailer was clean, flowers around?

02:05:51.836 --> 02:05:53.576
- Yep.
- I didn't do that.

02:05:53.796 --> 02:05:56.003
Sissy did it. She was there.

02:05:56.215 --> 02:05:58.422
She left you a note
asking you to phone her.

02:05:58.634 --> 02:06:02.218
But I tore it up
cos I was sort of jealous.

02:06:03.139 --> 02:06:05.596
I wanted to keep my cowboy.

02:06:06.642 --> 02:06:10.260
You don't love me, bud.
And I don't really love you.

02:06:10.480 --> 02:06:12.471
Not like that.

02:06:13.107 --> 02:06:15.348
So you shouldn't let her get away.

02:06:18.613 --> 02:06:20.649
But I tell you what.

02:06:21.741 --> 02:06:25.404
If you ever wanna make her jealous,
you know where I am.

02:06:25.620 --> 02:06:27.156
I gotta go.

02:06:56.567 --> 02:06:58.398
Sissy!

02:07:29.350 --> 02:07:31.386
Sissy?

02:07:32.520 --> 02:07:35.057
Get outta here, bud. I mean it!

02:07:35.606 --> 02:07:38.643
- I gotta talk to you.
- Wes is in gilley's and we're leavin'.

02:07:38.860 --> 02:07:42.819
I know you're leavin',
but I just wanted to tell you somethin'.

02:07:45.032 --> 02:07:48.524
I'm hard-headed, and I'm prideful.

02:07:49.620 --> 02:07:53.784
And I wanna apologize clear back to
when I hit you the first time.

02:07:56.377 --> 02:07:58.413
I love you, sissy.

02:08:04.677 --> 02:08:06.713
I love you, too, bud!

02:08:08.264 --> 02:08:10.255
You do?

02:08:11.809 --> 02:08:14.141
I didn't know you came
to the trailer that day.

02:08:14.353 --> 02:08:18.517
If I'd known that, I'd have called you.
But she tore up that note.

02:08:20.776 --> 02:08:24.940
- Shit, you can ride that bull anytime.
- I don't wanna ride it!

02:08:25.156 --> 02:08:28.944
And screw Mexico because
we can do anythin' we want! I got...

02:08:29.994 --> 02:08:32.485
- What happened to your face?
- I got hit.

02:08:32.705 --> 02:08:34.696
Did he hit you?

02:08:35.666 --> 02:08:38.453
Goddamn, I'm gonna kill
that son of a bitch!

02:08:38.669 --> 02:08:41.456
Bud, just leave him alone! Bud!

02:09:01.817 --> 02:09:04.604
Wes, what's goin' on? Shit.

02:09:38.604 --> 02:09:41.687
All right! Check that office!

02:09:42.525 --> 02:09:45.358
Peter, pick up the money here,
would you?

02:09:45.569 --> 02:09:48.185
- Sam, the door's locked!
- Good job, bud!

02:09:52.285 --> 02:09:56.119
Bud, I swear I didn't know
about any of that. I swear.

02:10:04.880 --> 02:10:08.338
- Keep that gun on him, Steve.
- See what he did with the keys?

02:10:08.551 --> 02:10:11.213
- He threw them in the garbage can.
- I know where you live.

02:10:11.846 --> 02:10:13.802
Hey, bud, you put it
on his ass pretty good!

02:10:14.015 --> 02:10:16.848
Y'all get back in the club.
It's all over with.

02:10:18.477 --> 02:10:20.934
Let's go! Get back in the club.

02:10:21.147 --> 02:10:26.437
- Come on, bud. I'll buy you a beer.
- No way! We're goin' home. Come on.

02:10:39.123 --> 02:10:41.159
Hey! You sure?

02:10:42.376 --> 02:10:45.834
- Hell, I'll buy you two beers!
- Jessie, take care of my car, ok?

02:10:46.047 --> 02:10:48.038
Don't worry about it, sissy!

02:11:42.103 --> 02:11:43.934
Damn!
