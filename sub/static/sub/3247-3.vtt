00:02.085 --> 00:07.091
Salutations. This is Sally Calypso
with the traffic news at 70: 75.

00:07.216 --> 00:11.847
We've got reports of
a multiple stack-pile at junction 50.9,

00:11.929 --> 00:15.399
with a spate of carjackings reported
on New 5th Avenue.

00:15.474 --> 00:18.603
So you take care now. Drive safely.

00:23.065 --> 00:26.239
They're gonna get in.
There's no stopping them.

00:27.819 --> 00:31.198
The police are on their way, I promise.
I've sounded the alarm.

00:31.281 --> 00:34.251
Repeat, this is car 1-0-Hawk-5.

00:34.326 --> 00:36.499
We have a problem,
require urgent assistance.

00:36.620 --> 00:39.373
Thank you for your call.
You have been placed on hold.

00:39.456 --> 00:40.628
It's all your fault.

00:40.707 --> 00:43.301
You lied to the computer.
You said there were three of us.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.505
You told them three!

00:45.629 --> 00:49.133
Repeat, urgent assistance.
Car 1-0-Hawk-5.

00:49.216 --> 00:51.514
This is an emergency. Help us!

00:51.593 --> 00:54.062
Oh, my God, I'm begging you!
Please, help us!

00:57.808 --> 01:02.939
The weather is at 36 degrees
and it's smooth skies all the way home.

01:03.021 --> 01:06.525
This is Sally Calypso signing off.
Missing you already.

01:43.729 --> 01:47.779
Just one trip, that's what I said.
One trip in the Tardis and then home.

01:47.858 --> 01:52.659
Although, I suppose we could
stretch the definition.

01:52.738 --> 01:55.332
Take one trip into the past,
one trip into the future.

01:55.407 --> 01:58.377
- How do you fancy that?
- No complaints from me!

01:58.452 --> 02:01.877
How about a different planet?

02:01.955 --> 02:04.128
Can we go to yours?

02:05.667 --> 02:07.669
No, there's plenty of other places.

02:07.753 --> 02:10.301
Come on.
I mean, the planet of the Time Lords.

02:10.380 --> 02:13.384
That's got to be worth a look.
What's it like?

02:13.467 --> 02:15.435
It's beautiful, yeah.

02:15.510 --> 02:19.981
Is it like, you know, outer space
cities, all spires and stuff?

02:20.057 --> 02:21.354
I suppose it is.

02:21.433 --> 02:24.186
Great big temples and cathedrals?

02:24.686 --> 02:25.778
Yeah.

02:25.854 --> 02:28.073
Lots of planets in the sky?

02:30.025 --> 02:32.153
The sky's a burnt orange.

02:33.904 --> 02:37.124
With a citadel enclosed
in a mighty glass dome,

02:38.283 --> 02:40.536
shining under the twin suns.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.584
Beyond that,
the mountains go on forever.

02:43.664 --> 02:46.668
Slopes of deep red grass,

02:47.751 --> 02:49.469
capped with snow.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.555
Can we go there?

02:57.678 --> 03:00.181
Nah! Where's the fun for me?
I don't want to go home.

03:00.263 --> 03:01.685
Instead...

03:04.184 --> 03:08.314
This is much better.
Year 5000000053. Planet New Earth.

03:08.397 --> 03:11.617
Second home of mankind.
50,000 light years from your old world,

03:11.692 --> 03:14.115
and we're slap-bang in the middle
of New New York.

03:14.236 --> 03:16.409
Although, technically,
it's 15 New Yorks since the original,

03:16.488 --> 03:19.958
so it's New New New New New New New New
New New New New New New New New York.

03:20.117 --> 03:22.290
One of the most dazzling cities
ever built.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.463
Oh, that's nice.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.791
A Time Lord version of dazzling!

03:26.873 --> 03:31.003
A bit of rain never hurt anyone.
Come on, let's get under cover.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.138
He has arrived.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.844
What should I do?

03:38.927 --> 03:42.306
Find him before it's too late.

03:50.856 --> 03:54.531
Well, it looks like the same old Earth
to me, on a Wednesday afternoon.

03:54.609 --> 03:56.703
Hold on, hold on, let's have a look.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.419
And the driving should be
clear and easy,

04:04.494 --> 04:08.374
with 75 extra lanes open for
the New New jersey Expressway.

04:08.915 --> 04:11.035
That's more like it!
That's the view we had last time.

04:11.376 --> 04:13.378
This must be the lower levels.

04:13.462 --> 04:15.840
Down at the base of the tower.
Some sort of undercity.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.923
You've brought me to the slums?

04:18.007 --> 04:20.761
Much more interesting.
It's all cocktails and glitter up there.

04:20.844 --> 04:23.472
- This is the real city.
- You'd enjoy anything.

04:23.555 --> 04:27.480
That's me. Ah, the rain's stopping.
Better and better!

04:27.559 --> 04:31.439
When you say last time,
was that you and Rose?

04:31.521 --> 04:34.400
Urn, yeah. Yeah, it was. Yeah.

04:34.483 --> 04:36.827
You're taking me to the same planets
that you took her?

04:36.902 --> 04:38.779
What's wrong with that?

04:38.862 --> 04:42.036
Nothing. just ever heard
the word "rebound"?

04:43.033 --> 04:46.253
Oh, you should have said!
How long have you been there?

04:46.369 --> 04:48.838
Happy. You want happy. Happy!

04:48.914 --> 04:52.214
Customers, customers!
We've got customers!

04:52.292 --> 04:53.418
We have business.

04:55.337 --> 04:57.010
Happy, happy, lovely happy!

04:57.088 --> 04:58.806
Anger. Buy some anger!

04:58.882 --> 05:02.011
It's mellow, makes you feel
all bendy and soft all day long.

05:02.093 --> 05:05.063
Don't go to them, they'll rip you off.
Do you want some happy?

05:05.138 --> 05:08.813
- No, thanks.
- Are they selling drugs?

05:08.892 --> 05:11.111
I think they're selling moods.

05:11.186 --> 05:13.063
Same thing, isn't it?

05:13.855 --> 05:17.530
- Over here, sweetheart!
- Hey, you, over here! Over here!

05:17.609 --> 05:20.488
Come over here, yeah.
And what can I get you, my love?

05:20.612 --> 05:23.240
- I want to buy forget.
- I've got forget, my darling.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.826
What strength?
How much do you want forgetting?

05:25.909 --> 05:28.879
It's my mother and father.
They went on the motorway.

05:28.954 --> 05:31.082
Oh, that's a swine.

05:32.165 --> 05:35.590
Try this. Forget 43. That's 2 credits.

05:35.669 --> 05:39.094
Sorry, but hold on a minute.
What happened to your parents?

05:39.172 --> 05:43.643
- They drove off.
- Yeah, but they might drive back.

05:43.718 --> 05:46.346
Everyone goes to the motorway
in the end.

05:46.429 --> 05:48.431
I've lost them.

05:48.515 --> 05:51.860
But they can't have gone far.
You could find them.

05:52.894 --> 05:54.612
No. No, no, don't!

05:58.358 --> 06:01.282
- I'm sorry, what were you saying?
- Your parents.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.864
Your mother and father.
They're on the motorway.

06:03.947 --> 06:05.290
Are they?

06:06.116 --> 06:07.868
That's nice.

06:08.952 --> 06:11.205
I'm sorry, I won't keep you.

06:15.333 --> 06:18.462
So that's the human race
five billion years in the future?

06:18.545 --> 06:20.798
Off their heads on chemicals.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.600
Sorry. I'm really sorry.
We just need three, that's all.

06:23.675 --> 06:26.428
- Let her go! I'm warning you!
- It's not our fault!

06:26.511 --> 06:29.060
Whatever you want, I can help.
We can help.

06:29.139 --> 06:31.938
- But first you've got to let her go!
- Sorry.

06:42.652 --> 06:46.532
The Doctor is so gonna kill you. Never
mind him, I'm gonna kill you myself!

06:46.656 --> 06:49.125
- Let go of me!
- Give her some sleep.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.043
Don't you dare! Don't put that near me.

06:51.119 --> 06:54.464
It's just sleep. It won't do you
any harm if you don't fight it.

06:54.539 --> 06:57.008
That's it, come on. That's it.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.718
Get on board.

07:05.342 --> 07:07.845
Engaging antigravs. Hold on.

07:14.559 --> 07:16.732
Martha!

07:22.859 --> 07:25.738
She's all right, she's breathing.
Pulse is fine.

07:25.862 --> 07:27.580
No harm done.

07:27.697 --> 07:30.416
She looks rich. She must have got lost.

07:30.533 --> 07:32.956
Well, she's worth
her weight in gold to us.

07:33.036 --> 07:37.462
This is car 4-6-5-Diamond-6.
We have three passengers, repeat, three.

07:37.540 --> 07:40.919
- Request access to the fast lane.
- Access granted.

07:41.044 --> 07:42.341
Oh, yes.

07:48.551 --> 07:51.725
I thought you'd come back.
Do you want some happy-happy?

07:51.805 --> 07:54.228
Those people, who were they?
Where did they take her?

07:54.307 --> 07:56.435
They've taken her to the motorway.

07:56.559 --> 07:58.357
Looked like carjackers to me.

07:58.436 --> 08:01.815
I'd give up now, darling.
You won't see her again.

08:01.898 --> 08:04.993
Used to be thriving, this place.
You couldn't move.

08:05.068 --> 08:06.748
But they all go to the motorway
in the end.

08:06.861 --> 08:09.381
He kept on saying three, we need three.
What did he mean, three?

08:09.447 --> 08:12.166
It's the car-sharing policy,
to save fuel.

08:12.242 --> 08:15.041
You get special access
if you're carrying three adults.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.290
This motorway, how do I get there?

08:16.291 --> 08:16.708
This motorway, how do I get there?

08:16.788 --> 08:19.883
Straight down the alley, keep going
to the end. You cannae miss it.

08:19.958 --> 08:24.304
Tell you what, buy some happy-happy.
Then you'll be smiling, my love.

08:24.379 --> 08:26.347
A word of advice to all of you.

08:26.423 --> 08:29.347
Cash up, close down and pack your bags.

08:29.426 --> 08:30.973
Why is that, then?

08:31.052 --> 08:33.554
Because as soon as
I've found her alive and well,

08:33.679 --> 08:36.854
and I will find her alive and well,
then I'm coming back.

08:36.933 --> 08:40.062
And this street is closing. Tonight!

08:50.155 --> 08:53.830
Now you just settle back.
It's all gonna be worth it.

08:55.410 --> 08:58.129
The view from the windows,

08:58.246 --> 09:00.795
you can see all the way out to the...

09:00.874 --> 09:05.220
Open sky. They say the air smells
like apple grass. Can you imagine?

09:05.295 --> 09:07.172
The houses are made of wood.

09:07.297 --> 09:10.892
There are jobs going in the foundries.
Everyone says so.

09:10.967 --> 09:14.642
Take me back. Whoever you are,
just take me back to my friend.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.975
That's all I want. I won't cause
any trouble, just take me back.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.777
I'm sorry. That's not a real gun.

09:21.603 --> 09:25.153
- Well, you would say that.
- Where do you get a gun from these days?

09:25.231 --> 09:27.609
I wouldn't even know how to fire.

09:27.692 --> 09:29.319
No, nor me.

09:30.028 --> 09:31.371
Okay.

09:31.446 --> 09:33.164
What's your name?

09:33.281 --> 09:35.830
Martha. Martha Jones.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.503
Well, I'm Cheen and this is Milo.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.673
And I swear, we're sorry.
We're really, really sorry.

09:41.748 --> 09:44.708
We just needed access to the fast lane,
but I promise as soon as we arrive,

09:44.751 --> 09:46.845
we'll drop you off, and you can go back
and find your friend.

09:47.003 --> 09:50.849
- Seriously?
- I swear. Look, honesty patch.

09:51.674 --> 09:56.180
All the same, it's still kidnapping.
Where are we anyway?

09:56.262 --> 09:58.981
- We're on the motorway.
- What's that then, fog?

09:59.057 --> 10:00.559
It's exhaust fumes.

10:00.642 --> 10:03.646
We're going out to Brooklyn. Everyone
says the air is so much cleaner.

10:03.728 --> 10:05.901
And we couldn't stay
at Pharmacy Town because...

10:05.980 --> 10:08.608
Well, 'cause of me. I'm pregnant.

10:08.691 --> 10:12.412
We only discovered it last week.
Scan says it's gonna be a boy.

10:12.487 --> 10:15.707
Right. What do I do now,
congratulate my kidnappers?

10:15.782 --> 10:19.286
We're not kidnappers. Not really.

10:19.369 --> 10:21.463
No! You're idiots!

10:21.538 --> 10:24.758
You're having a baby
and you're wearing that?

10:24.833 --> 10:26.210
Not any more.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.169
This will be as fast as we can.

10:28.253 --> 10:30.221
We'll take the motorway
to the Brooklyn ﬂyover

10:30.296 --> 10:33.220
and then it's gonna take a while
'cause then there's no fast lane,

10:33.341 --> 10:35.014
just ordinary roads,
but at least it's direct.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.471
- It's only 10 miles.
- How long is it gonna take?

10:37.554 --> 10:39.227
About six years.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.317
What?

10:43.393 --> 10:46.237
It'll be just in time for him
to start school.

10:46.938 --> 10:49.782
No, sorry, hold on. Six years?

10:49.899 --> 10:52.368
Ten miles in six years? How come?

11:21.806 --> 11:26.186
Hey! You daft little street strut!
What are you doing standing there?

11:26.269 --> 11:28.943
Either get out or get in. Come on!

11:33.860 --> 11:36.534
- Did you ever see the like?
- Here you go.

11:36.613 --> 11:39.492
He was just standing there,
breathing it in.

11:39.574 --> 11:43.420
There's this story. It says
back in the old days, on junction 47,

11:43.494 --> 11:47.374
this woman stood in the exhaust fumes
for a solid 20 minutes.

11:47.457 --> 11:50.586
By the time they found her,
her head had swollen to 50 feet.

11:50.668 --> 11:54.969
- Oh, you're making it up!
- A 50-foot head. just think of it.

11:55.048 --> 11:58.348
- Imagine picking that nose.
- Oh, stop it. That's disgusting.

11:58.426 --> 12:00.099
What, did you never pick your nose?

12:00.178 --> 12:03.307
- Bran, we're moving.
- Right, I'm there. I'm on it.

12:12.148 --> 12:15.277
Twenty yards. We're having a good day.

12:15.360 --> 12:18.239
And who might you be, sir?
Very well dressed for a hitchhiker.

12:18.321 --> 12:20.369
Thanks. Sorry, I'm the Doctor.

12:20.448 --> 12:24.123
Medical man?
My name's Thomas Kincade Brannigan,

12:24.202 --> 12:26.671
and this is the bane of my life,
the lovely Valerie.

12:26.746 --> 12:27.838
Nice to meet you.

12:27.914 --> 12:30.918
And that's the rest of
the family behind you.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.179
Oh, that's nice.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.347
Hello.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.184
- How old are they?
- Just two months.

12:44.305 --> 12:48.355
Poor little souls. They've never known
the ground beneath their paws.

12:48.476 --> 12:50.353
Children of the motorway.

12:50.436 --> 12:53.360
- What, they were born in here?
- We couldn't stop.

12:53.439 --> 12:56.784
We heard there were jobs going,
out in the laundries on Fire Island.

12:56.859 --> 13:00.204
- Thought we'd take a chance.
- You've been driving for two months?

13:00.280 --> 13:04.376
Do I look like a teenager?
We've been driving for 12 years now.

13:04.492 --> 13:05.539
Sorry?

13:05.618 --> 13:08.872
Yeah, started out as newlyweds.
Feels like yesterday.

13:08.997 --> 13:12.752
- Feels like 12 years to me.
- Ah, sweetheart, but you still love me.

13:12.875 --> 13:15.344
Twelve years? How far did you come?
Where did you start?

13:15.420 --> 13:17.593
Battery Park. It's five miles back.

13:17.714 --> 13:20.263
You travelled five miles in 12 years?

13:20.383 --> 13:22.385
I think he's a bit slow.

13:23.219 --> 13:26.564
- Where are you from?
- Never mind that. I've got to get out!

13:26.681 --> 13:28.882
My friend's in one of these cars.
She was taken hostage.

13:28.891 --> 13:31.110
I should get back to the Tardis.

13:31.185 --> 13:34.780
You're too late for that.
We've passed the lay-by.

13:34.897 --> 13:37.116
You're a passenger now, sonny Jim.

13:37.233 --> 13:40.954
- When's the next lay-by?
- Oh, six months.

13:48.745 --> 13:52.545
- How many cars are out there?
- I don't think anyone knows.

13:53.207 --> 13:55.255
Here we go. Hungry?

13:55.960 --> 13:57.428
Oh, thanks.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.723
How far down is it to this fast lane?

14:00.798 --> 14:03.017
It's right at the bottom,
underneath the traffic jam.

14:03.092 --> 14:06.767
Not many people can afford three
passengers, so it's empty down there.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.520
Rumour has it
you can reach up to 30 miles per hour.

14:09.599 --> 14:11.727
Wow, that's like, crazy.

14:12.435 --> 14:15.279
But how are you supposed to
live inside this thing? It's tiny!

14:15.396 --> 14:17.023
Oh, we stocked up.

14:17.106 --> 14:20.610
We've got self-replicating fuel,
muscle stimulants for exercise,

14:20.693 --> 14:22.445
there's a chemical toilet at the back

14:22.570 --> 14:25.665
and all waste products
are recycled as food.

14:26.783 --> 14:28.035
Okay.

14:28.117 --> 14:30.245
Oh, now, a gap. This is brilliant!

14:30.328 --> 14:34.629
Car 4-6-5-Diamond-6 on descent to
fast lane. Thank you very much.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.633
I need to talk to the police.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.966
Thank you for your call.
You have been placed on hold.

14:43.091 --> 14:44.468
You're the police!

14:44.550 --> 14:48.145
Thank you for your call.
You have been placed on hold.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.978
Is there anyone else?
I once met the Duke of Manhattan.

14:51.099 --> 14:52.779
Is there any way of
getting through to him?

14:52.850 --> 14:55.353
- Oh, now, ain't you lordly?
- I've got to find my friend!

14:55.478 --> 14:59.108
You can't make outside calls.
The motorway's completely enclosed.

14:59.190 --> 15:00.316
What about the other cars?

15:00.400 --> 15:02.903
We've got contact with them, yeah.
Well, some of them anyway.

15:03.027 --> 15:06.122
They've got to be on your friends' list.
Now, let's see, who's near by?

15:06.197 --> 15:08.291
Ah, the Cassini sisters!

15:09.158 --> 15:12.583
Be still your hearts, my handsome girls.
It's Brannigan here.

15:12.662 --> 15:16.257
Get off the line, Brannigan.
You're a pest and a menace.

15:16.332 --> 15:20.007
Come on now, sisters, is that any way
to talk to an old friend?

15:20.086 --> 15:23.681
You know full well we're not sisters.
We're married.

15:23.798 --> 15:27.268
Ooh! Stop that modern talk,
I'm an old-fashioned cat.

15:27.343 --> 15:31.598
Now, I've got a hitchhiker here,
calls himself the Doctor.

15:31.681 --> 15:33.775
Hello. Sorry, I'm looking for someone
called Martha Jones.

15:33.850 --> 15:35.318
She's been carjacked.

15:35.393 --> 15:37.646
She's inside one of these vehicles,
but I don't know which one.

15:37.728 --> 15:39.401
Wait a minute.

15:40.857 --> 15:43.952
Could I ask what entrance did they use?

15:44.026 --> 15:45.528
- Where were we?
- Pharmacy Town.

15:45.653 --> 15:47.451
Pharmacy Town, about 20 minutes ago.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.624
Let's have a look.

15:49.699 --> 15:52.293
Just my luck to marry a car-spotter.

15:52.368 --> 15:54.211
In the last half hour,

15:54.287 --> 15:58.508
53 new cars joined from
the Pharmacy Town junction.

15:58.583 --> 16:00.631
Anything more specific?

16:00.710 --> 16:02.758
All in good time.

16:02.879 --> 16:06.258
- Was she carjacked by two people?
- Yes, she was. Yeah.

16:06.340 --> 16:10.265
There we are! just one of those cars
was destined for the fast lane.

16:10.344 --> 16:12.563
That means they had three on board.

16:12.638 --> 16:16.063
And the car number is 4-6-5-Diamond-6.

16:16.142 --> 16:17.689
That's it! So how do we find them?

16:17.768 --> 16:20.487
Ah. Now there I'm afraid I can't help.

16:20.563 --> 16:23.032
We can call them on this thing.
We've got their number, Diamond-6.

16:23.107 --> 16:26.202
Not if they're designated fast lane.
It's a different class.

16:26.277 --> 16:29.781
- You could try the police.
- They put me on hold.

16:29.864 --> 16:33.118
You'll have to keep trying.
There's no one else.

16:33.951 --> 16:35.328
Thank you.

16:43.419 --> 16:47.014
See? Another ten layers to go,
and we're scorching.

16:51.928 --> 16:53.225
What's that?

16:54.263 --> 16:55.890
It's coming from underneath.

16:55.973 --> 16:59.773
It's that noise, isn't it? It's like
Kate said, the stories, they're true!

16:59.852 --> 17:01.069
What stories?

17:01.145 --> 17:03.113
It's the sound of the air vents,
that's all.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.531
Exhaust fumes travel down,

17:04.607 --> 17:06.608
so at the base of the tunnel
they've got air vents.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.786
No, but the stories are much better.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.990
They say people go missing
on the motorway.

17:12.114 --> 17:15.163
Some cars just vanish,
never to be seen again,

17:15.284 --> 17:18.914
'cause there's something
living down there in the smoke.

17:19.747 --> 17:21.875
Something huge

17:22.415 --> 17:24.089
and hungry.

17:24.794 --> 17:28.344
And if you get lost on the road,
it's waiting for you.

17:34.178 --> 17:36.681
Well, like I said, air vents.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.980
Going down to the next layer.

17:40.059 --> 17:44.439
Except, look out there. Does it look
like the air vents are working?

17:44.522 --> 17:45.819
No.

17:50.486 --> 17:52.580
So what's that, then?

17:54.574 --> 17:56.668
Nah, kids' stuff.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.916
Car 4-6-5-Diamond-6, on descent.

17:59.996 --> 18:02.044
We've got to go to the fast lane.
Take me down.

18:02.123 --> 18:03.716
Not in a million years.

18:03.791 --> 18:06.544
- You've got three passengers.
- I'm still not going.

18:06.627 --> 18:08.425
She's alone and she's lost.

18:08.504 --> 18:11.724
She doesn't even belong on this planet,
and it's all my fault.

18:11.799 --> 18:13.426
I'm asking you, Brannigan, take me down.

18:13.509 --> 18:16.388
That's a no, and that's final.

18:16.470 --> 18:19.064
I'm not risking the children down there.

18:19.140 --> 18:20.983
Why not? What's the risk?
What happens down there?

18:21.058 --> 18:24.528
We're not discussing it.
The conversation is closed.

18:25.187 --> 18:27.189
- So we keep on driving?
- Yes, we do.

18:27.273 --> 18:30.117
- For how long?
- Till the journey's end.

18:32.695 --> 18:34.493
Mrs Cassini, this is the Doctor.

18:34.572 --> 18:36.666
Tell me, how long have you been driving
on the motorway?

18:36.741 --> 18:38.493
Oh, we were amongst the first.

18:38.576 --> 18:41.170
It's been 23 years now.

18:41.245 --> 18:44.875
And in all that time,
have you ever seen a police car?

18:48.169 --> 18:49.671
I'm not sure.

18:50.713 --> 18:53.057
Look at your notes. Any police?

18:55.343 --> 18:58.142
- Not as such.
- Or an ambulance?

18:58.220 --> 19:01.190
Rescue service? Anything official, ever?

19:01.265 --> 19:03.518
I can't keep a note of everything.

19:03.601 --> 19:05.353
What if there's no one out there?

19:05.436 --> 19:08.531
Stop it.
The Cassinis were doing you a favour.

19:08.606 --> 19:12.201
Someone's got to ask, 'cause you
might not talk about it, but it's there,

19:12.318 --> 19:13.945
in your eyes.

19:14.904 --> 19:17.453
What if the traffic jam never stops?

19:17.573 --> 19:21.328
There's a whole city above us.
The mighty city-state of New New York.

19:21.410 --> 19:25.210
- They wouldn't just leave us.
- In that case, where are they? Hmm?

19:26.749 --> 19:29.844
What if there's no help coming,
not ever?

19:29.919 --> 19:31.921
What if there's nothing?

19:32.046 --> 19:34.014
Just the motorway?

19:34.090 --> 19:38.641
With the cars going round and round
and round, never stopping? Forever!

19:38.761 --> 19:41.264
Shut up! just shut up!

19:41.722 --> 19:44.100
This is Sally Calypso,

19:44.183 --> 19:46.402
and it's that time again.

19:46.519 --> 19:50.274
The sun is blazing high in the sky
over the New Atlantic.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.859
The perfect setting for
the daily contemplation.

19:52.942 --> 19:55.661
You think you know us so well, Doctor.

19:55.778 --> 19:58.998
We are not abandoned.
Not while we have each other.

19:59.115 --> 20:01.618
This is for all of you
out there on the roads.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.374
We 're so sorry.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.497
Drive safe.

20:08.124 --> 20:10.718
♪ On a hill far away

20:10.793 --> 20:16.141

21:32.792 --> 21:35.545
Fast lane access. Please drive safely.

21:35.628 --> 21:38.381
We made it. The fast lane.

21:48.265 --> 21:51.269
If you won't take me,
I'll go there on my own.

21:51.393 --> 21:53.771
What do you think you're doing?

21:53.896 --> 21:56.115
Finding my own way. I usually do.

21:56.232 --> 21:59.111
Capsule open.

22:02.112 --> 22:03.614
Here we go.

22:06.951 --> 22:09.204
Look after this.

22:09.286 --> 22:12.711
I love that coat.
Janis Joplin gave me that coat.

22:12.790 --> 22:14.463
But you can't jump!

22:14.542 --> 22:17.842
If it's any consolation, Valerie,
right now I'm having kittens.

22:17.920 --> 22:21.470
This Martha,
she must mean an awful lot to you.

22:21.590 --> 22:23.433
Hardly know her.

22:23.509 --> 22:25.682
I was too busy showing off.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.893
And I lied to her.

22:28.973 --> 22:31.317
I couldn't help it, just lied.

22:31.892 --> 22:33.235
Bye, then!

22:41.235 --> 22:43.784
He's completely insane!

22:43.863 --> 22:46.616
That, and a bit magnificent!

22:49.285 --> 22:51.754
Capsule open.

22:51.829 --> 22:53.126
Who the hell are you?

22:53.205 --> 22:55.424
Sorry, motorway foot patrol.
I'm doing a survey.

22:55.499 --> 22:57.046
How are you enjoying your motorway?

22:57.126 --> 23:00.596
Well, not very much. junction 5's
been closed for three years.

23:00.671 --> 23:03.550
Thank you, your comments
have been noted. Have a nice day!

23:15.144 --> 23:16.817
Capsule open.

23:20.399 --> 23:21.867
Capsule open.

23:21.942 --> 23:24.661
Thank you for your cooperation.
Your comments have been noted.

23:24.737 --> 23:28.458
Do you mind if I borrow this?
Not my colour, but thank you very much!

23:31.827 --> 23:33.670
Capsule open.

23:33.829 --> 23:35.547
Oh, don't mind me.

23:40.586 --> 23:42.213
Capsule open.

23:45.341 --> 23:46.809
Capsule open.

23:52.222 --> 23:53.690
Try again.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.768
Brooklyn turn off 7, closed.

23:55.851 --> 23:57.273
Try the next one.

23:57.353 --> 23:59.572
Brooklyn turn off Z closed.

23:59.647 --> 24:01.274
What do we do?

24:01.357 --> 24:03.117
We keep going round,
we'll do the whole loop,

24:03.192 --> 24:05.445
by the time we come back round,
they'll be open.

24:09.156 --> 24:11.579
You still calling that air vents?

24:11.659 --> 24:13.536
What else could it be?

24:18.707 --> 24:21.631
- What the hell is that?
- It's just the hydraulics.

24:21.710 --> 24:23.633
Sounds like it's alive!

24:23.712 --> 24:26.306
It's all exhaust fumes out there.
Nothing could breathe in that.

24:26.382 --> 24:30.262
Calling car 4-6-5-Diamond-6.
Repeat calling car 4-6-5-Diamond-6.

24:30.344 --> 24:32.344
This is 4-6-5-Diamond-6.
Who's that? Where are you?

24:32.346 --> 24:34.849
I'm in the fast lane,
about 50 yards behind.

24:34.932 --> 24:37.560
Can you gel' back up?
Can you get off the fast lane?

24:37.643 --> 24:40.271
We only have permission to go down.
We need the Brooklyn Flyover.

24:40.354 --> 24:43.483
- It's closed. Go back up.
- We can't. We’ll just go round.

24:43.565 --> 24:46.614
Don't you understand?
They're closed, they're always closed.

24:46.694 --> 24:49.914
We're stuck down here. There's
something else out there in the fog.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.241
Can't you hear it?

24:52.658 --> 24:56.629
- That's the air vents.
- Jehovah, what are you, some stupid kid?

24:56.704 --> 24:58.798
Get out of here!

25:01.709 --> 25:02.881
What was that?

25:04.294 --> 25:06.672
We can't move. It got us.

25:06.755 --> 25:08.928
- What's happening?
- What's got you? What is it?

25:09.008 --> 25:10.305
I don't know...

25:13.053 --> 25:14.896
- Hello?
- Just drive, you idiots!

25:14.972 --> 25:16.349
Get out of here!

25:16.432 --> 25:18.434
- Na!
- Can you hear me? Hello?

25:18.517 --> 25:20.736
Just drive! Do what she said,
get us out of here!

25:20.811 --> 25:23.781
- But where?
- Just straight ahead! And fast!

25:24.440 --> 25:27.785
What is it? What's out there?
What's happening?

25:30.070 --> 25:32.448
Capsule open.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.659
Excuse me! Is that legal?

25:34.742 --> 25:37.211
Sorry, motorway foot patrol.

25:37.786 --> 25:39.413
Whatever. Have you got any water?

25:39.496 --> 25:43.091
Certainly. Never let it be said
I've lost my manners.

25:46.587 --> 25:47.884
Is this the last layer?

25:47.963 --> 25:50.403
We're right at the bottom.
Nothing below us but the fast lane.

25:50.466 --> 25:52.343
- Can we drive down?
- There's only two of us.

25:52.468 --> 25:54.266
- You need three to go down.
- Couldn't we cheat?

25:54.344 --> 25:58.349
I'd love to, but it's an automated
system. The wheel would lock.

25:58.432 --> 26:00.150
Then excuse me.

26:00.976 --> 26:03.195
You can’t jump, it's 1,000 feet down!

26:03.270 --> 26:04.863
No, I just want a look.

26:06.315 --> 26:08.443
What's that noise?

26:08.525 --> 26:11.074
I try not to think about it.

26:12.321 --> 26:15.370
What are those lights?
What's down there?

26:20.079 --> 26:21.922
I just need to see.

26:22.998 --> 26:25.171
There must be some sort of ventilation.

26:25.250 --> 26:28.595
If I could just transmit a pulse through
this thing, I could trip the system.

26:28.670 --> 26:31.344
Give us a bit of a breeze.

26:33.842 --> 26:36.345
Just what we need! Pirates!

26:36.428 --> 26:38.430
I'm calling the police!

26:40.516 --> 26:42.518
The Doctor, where is he?

26:45.020 --> 26:48.775
That's it! Might shift the fumes a bit,
give us a good look.

26:51.527 --> 26:53.450
What are those shapes?

26:54.488 --> 26:56.035
They're alive.

26:57.533 --> 26:59.501
What the hell are they?

27:04.873 --> 27:06.466
Macra.

27:11.880 --> 27:14.383
- Go faster!
- I'm at full speed!

27:19.221 --> 27:21.144
No access above.

27:21.223 --> 27:23.317
But this is an emergency!

27:25.435 --> 27:28.655
Thank you for your call.
You have been placed on hold.

27:31.817 --> 27:33.819
- Turn everything off!
- You've got to be joking!

27:33.902 --> 27:36.405
Listen, it's all fog out there,
so how can they see us?

27:36.572 --> 27:40.793
Maybe it's the engine, the sound,
or the heat or the light, I don't know.

27:40.868 --> 27:43.337
But if you turn everything off,
they might not be able to find us.

27:43.412 --> 27:45.255
What if you're wrong?

27:49.084 --> 27:51.428
It can't be worse than this. just do it!

28:16.737 --> 28:18.739
They've stopped.

28:19.281 --> 28:21.875
Yeah, but they're still out there.

28:23.368 --> 28:25.416
How did you think of that?

28:25.495 --> 28:27.873
I saw it in a film.

28:27.956 --> 28:30.584
They used to do it in submarines.

28:30.667 --> 28:34.012
Trouble is,
I can't remember what they did next.

28:34.087 --> 28:36.808
Well, you'd better think of something,
'cause we've lost the air-con.

28:36.840 --> 28:39.593
If we don't switch the engines back on,
we won't be able to breathe.

28:39.676 --> 28:41.644
How long have we got?

28:41.720 --> 28:43.597
Eight minutes maximum.

28:48.352 --> 28:51.822
The Macra used to be
the scourge of this galaxy. Gas.

28:51.897 --> 28:54.571
They fed off gas.
The filthier, the better.

28:54.650 --> 28:56.903
They built up a small empire
using humans as slaves

28:56.985 --> 28:58.407
and mining gas for food.

28:58.487 --> 29:01.331
They don't exactly
look like empire-builders to me.

29:01.406 --> 29:04.125
Well, that was billions of years ago.

29:04.201 --> 29:08.502
Billions. They must have devolved
down the years. Now they're just beasts.

29:08.664 --> 29:11.042
But they're still hungry,
and my friend's down there.

29:12.876 --> 29:16.426
It's like New Times Square in here!
For goodness sake!

29:16.505 --> 29:18.758
I've invented a sport!

29:18.840 --> 29:21.093
Doctor! You're a hard man to find.

29:21.176 --> 29:22.928
No guns! I'm not having guns!

29:23.011 --> 29:25.184
I only brought this in case of pirates.

29:25.264 --> 29:28.564
- Doctor, you've got to come with me.
- Do I know you?

29:29.643 --> 29:31.862
You haven't aged at all.

29:31.937 --> 29:34.315
Time has been less kind to me.

29:35.399 --> 29:36.946
Novice Hame!

29:37.067 --> 29:39.069
Whoa, hold on. Get off!

29:39.152 --> 29:41.632
Last time we met, you were
breeding humans for experimentation.

29:41.697 --> 29:43.825
I've sought forgiveness, Doctor,

29:43.907 --> 29:47.286
for so many years under his guidance.

29:47.369 --> 29:50.714
And if you come with me, I might
finally be able to redeem myself.

29:50.831 --> 29:53.960
I'm not going anywhere. You've got Macra
living underneath this city. Macra!

29:54.042 --> 29:55.885
If my friend's still alive,
she's stuck down there!

29:55.961 --> 29:57.884
You've got to come with me right now!

29:57.963 --> 30:00.307
No, you're coming with me.
We've got three passengers now.

30:00.382 --> 30:04.979
I'm sorry, Doctor, but the situation
is even worse than you can imagine.

30:05.345 --> 30:08.349
- Transport.
- Don't you dare! Don't you dare!

30:14.646 --> 30:16.865
Rough teleport. Ow!

30:16.940 --> 30:19.238
You can go straight back down
and teleport people out,

30:19.318 --> 30:22.242
- starting with Martha!
- I only had the power for one trip.

30:22.321 --> 30:24.164
Then get some more! Where are we?

30:24.239 --> 30:26.867
High above, in the Overcity.

30:26.950 --> 30:30.170
Good, 'cause you can tell the senate
of New New York I'd like a word.

30:30.245 --> 30:33.340
They have got thousands of people
trapped on the motorway! Millions!

30:33.415 --> 30:36.419
But you're inside the senate, right now.

30:37.461 --> 30:40.055
May the goddess Santori bless thee.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.929
They died, Doctor.

30:48.138 --> 30:50.015
The city died.

30:51.266 --> 30:53.064
How long has it been like this?

30:53.143 --> 30:54.861
24 years.

31:02.277 --> 31:04.871
All of them? Everyone? What happened?

31:04.946 --> 31:07.870
A new chemical. A new mood.

31:08.742 --> 31:11.120
They called it "bliss".

31:11.203 --> 31:14.002
Everyone tried it. They couldn't stop.

31:14.623 --> 31:19.254
A virus mutated
inside the compound and became airborne.

31:19.836 --> 31:23.181
Everything perished.
Even the virus in the end.

31:25.092 --> 31:28.312
It killed the world
in seven minutes flat.

31:28.387 --> 31:31.766
There was just enough time to close down
the walkways and the ﬂyovers,

31:31.848 --> 31:34.021
sealing off the Undercity.

31:34.559 --> 31:38.029
Those people on the motorway
aren't lost, Doctor.

31:38.105 --> 31:39.607
They were saved.

31:39.689 --> 31:41.817
So the whole thing down there
is running on automatic.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.743
There's not enough power
to get them out.

31:43.819 --> 31:46.493
We did all we could
to stop the system from choking.

31:46.655 --> 31:48.828
Who's we? How did you survive?

31:48.949 --> 31:51.293
He protected me.

31:51.368 --> 31:55.544
And he has waited for you
these long years.

31:55.664 --> 31:57.837
Doctor.

32:01.837 --> 32:03.510
The Face of Boe!

32:04.172 --> 32:06.391
I knew you would come.

32:07.426 --> 32:11.147
Back in the old days,
I was made his nurse

32:11.221 --> 32:13.189
as penance for my sin.

32:13.306 --> 32:15.434
Old friend, what happened to you?

32:15.517 --> 32:17.360
A failing.

32:17.477 --> 32:21.527
He protected me from the virus
by shrouding me in his smoke.

32:22.107 --> 32:25.452
But with no one to maintain it,
the city's power died.

32:25.527 --> 32:28.656
The Undercity would have fallen
into the sea.

32:29.739 --> 32:31.537
So he saved them.

32:31.616 --> 32:35.337
The Face of Boe wired himself
into the mainframe.

32:35.412 --> 32:39.133
He's giving his life force
just to keep things running.

32:39.207 --> 32:41.881
But there are planets out there.
You could have called for help.

32:42.002 --> 32:45.723
The last act of the senate
was to declare New Earth unsafe.

32:45.797 --> 32:48.801
The automatic quarantine
lasts for 100 years.

32:55.432 --> 32:57.810
So the two of you stayed here.

33:00.145 --> 33:02.443
On your own for all these years.

33:02.522 --> 33:04.240
We had no choice.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.532
Yes, you did.

33:10.155 --> 33:12.578
Save them, Doctor.

33:12.908 --> 33:15.161
Save them.

33:21.541 --> 33:23.418
How much air is left?

33:25.504 --> 33:27.472
Two minutes.

33:30.091 --> 33:32.219
There's always the Doctor.

33:32.302 --> 33:34.600
That friend of mine.

33:34.679 --> 33:36.807
He might think of something.

33:36.890 --> 33:38.938
Martha, no one's coming.

33:43.939 --> 33:46.067
He looked kind of nice.

33:46.149 --> 33:49.744
- He's a bit more than that.
- Are you and him...

33:49.819 --> 33:52.743
Sometimes I think he likes me,

33:52.822 --> 33:55.951
but sometimes I just think
he needs someone with him.

33:58.286 --> 34:01.210
I never even asked. Where's home?

34:02.791 --> 34:04.589
A long way away.

34:06.461 --> 34:10.261
I didn't really think.
I just followed the Doctor and...

34:12.050 --> 34:14.724
They don't even know where I am.

34:14.803 --> 34:17.056
My mum and dad.

34:17.138 --> 34:20.016
If I died here, they'd never know.

34:22.185 --> 34:25.280
So, um, who is he, then? This Doctor?

34:26.982 --> 34:29.076
I don't know.

34:29.150 --> 34:31.152
Well, not really.

34:31.235 --> 34:33.534
There's so much he never says.

34:34.155 --> 34:36.658
But that means that

34:36.783 --> 34:39.411
the only hope right now is

34:39.494 --> 34:41.337
a complete stranger.

34:44.873 --> 34:48.424
- Well, that's no use!
- But it is, though.

34:48.503 --> 34:51.005
Because you haven't seen
the things he can do.

34:51.089 --> 34:54.217
Honestly, just trust me. Both of you.

34:54.301 --> 34:58.226
You've got your faith,
you've got your songs and your hymns,

34:58.305 --> 35:00.353
and I've got the Doctor.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.403
Right.

35:07.689 --> 35:10.158
Systems back online.

35:13.862 --> 35:16.081
- Good luck.
- And you.

35:24.164 --> 35:27.418
Car 4-6-5-Diamond-6, it still registers!
That's Martha.

35:27.500 --> 35:31.004
I knew she was good.
Novice Hame, hold that in place.

35:33.173 --> 35:36.473
Take the residual energy, convert it,
feed it through the electricity system.

35:36.551 --> 35:39.896
- But there isn't enough power.
- Oh, you got power! You got me!

35:39.971 --> 35:41.731
I'm brilliant with computers,
just you watch.

35:41.848 --> 35:44.977
Ha me, every switch
on that bank up to maximum!

35:50.148 --> 35:53.277
I can't power up the city,
but all the city needs is people.

35:53.401 --> 35:55.495
So what are you going to do?

35:55.570 --> 35:57.163
This!

35:58.281 --> 36:00.750
No, no, no, no, no, no!

36:16.424 --> 36:19.303
The transformers are blocked.
The signal can't get through.

36:19.427 --> 36:22.146
- Doctor.
- Yeah, hold on, not now.

36:22.222 --> 36:24.600
[give you my last...

36:30.980 --> 36:32.653
Hame, look after him!

36:32.732 --> 36:35.281
Don't you go dying on me,
you big old face.

36:35.360 --> 36:36.657
You've got to see this.

36:38.113 --> 36:40.457
The open road. Ha!

36:41.783 --> 36:44.582
- What in Jehovah was that?
- It's coming from above!

36:44.661 --> 36:46.880
What is it? What's happening?

36:49.749 --> 36:51.217
Hold on, May.

36:54.629 --> 36:56.631
Of all the cats in the kingdom.

37:00.593 --> 37:02.015
What is it?

37:10.645 --> 37:12.067
What is it?

37:16.609 --> 37:17.861
Yes!

37:19.112 --> 37:21.240
It's the sun!

37:21.322 --> 37:23.825
Oh, Brannigan!

37:24.242 --> 37:26.995
Children, it's the sunlight!

37:28.246 --> 37:32.422
Sorry, no Sally Calypso, she was just
a hologram. My name's the Doctor.

37:32.500 --> 37:33.843
He's a magician.

37:33.918 --> 37:36.637
And this is an order. Everyone drive up.

37:36.713 --> 37:38.215
- Right now.
- Is he serious?

37:38.339 --> 37:40.307
I've opened the roof of the motorway.
Come on.

37:40.383 --> 37:43.683
Throttle those engines. Drive up.

37:43.845 --> 37:46.189
All of you, the whole Undercity,
drive up.

37:46.306 --> 37:48.479
- Here we go.
- Drive up. Drive up!

37:48.558 --> 37:50.731
We've got to clear that fast lane.

37:50.852 --> 37:54.152
- Drive up and get out of the way.
- Here we go! Whoo!

37:54.355 --> 37:58.781
0i! Car 4-6-5 -Diamond-6.
Martha! Drive up!

37:58.860 --> 38:01.613
- That's the Doctor!
- We can't go up, we'll hit the lane!

38:01.696 --> 38:03.289
Do as he says. Go up!

38:03.364 --> 38:06.243
You've got access above.
Now, go!

38:19.047 --> 38:20.594
It's daylight.

38:21.883 --> 38:25.433
Oh, my God, that's the sky.
The real sky!

38:26.221 --> 38:27.814
He did it!

38:29.224 --> 38:31.192
I told you. He did it!

38:40.026 --> 38:44.406
Did I tell you, Doctor, you're
not bad, sir? You're not bad at all.

38:52.247 --> 38:55.547
You keep driving, Brannigan.
All the way up.

38:55.625 --> 38:58.674
'Cause it's here, just waiting for you.

38:58.753 --> 39:02.007
The city of New New York,
and it's yours.

39:02.090 --> 39:04.263
And don't forget, I want that coat back.

39:04.342 --> 39:06.765
I reckon that's a fair bargain, sir.

39:06.886 --> 39:10.265
Car 4-6-5-Diamond-6, I've sent you
a flight path, come to the senate.

39:10.390 --> 39:11.858
On my way!

39:11.933 --> 39:13.981
Quite a while since I saw you,
Martha Jones.

39:14.060 --> 39:15.437
Doctor!

39:38.626 --> 39:40.048
Doctor?

39:41.796 --> 39:43.264
Over here.

39:43.339 --> 39:45.762
Doctor! What happened out there?

39:48.636 --> 39:49.979
What's that?

39:50.096 --> 39:53.475
It's the Face of Boe.
It's all right, come say hello.

39:53.558 --> 39:56.482
And this is Hame. She's a cat.
Don't worry.

39:58.479 --> 40:00.481
He's the one that saved you, not me.

40:00.648 --> 40:03.902
My lord gave his life to save the city.

40:05.486 --> 40:07.580
And now he's dying.

40:07.697 --> 40:11.418
No, don't say that.
Not old Boe, plenty of life left.

40:11.492 --> 40:14.621
It's good to breathe the air once more.

40:15.705 --> 40:17.503
Who is he?

40:19.542 --> 40:21.340
I don't even know.

40:22.003 --> 40:25.724
Legend says the Face of Boe
has lived for billions of years.

40:26.758 --> 40:28.886
Isn't that right?

40:28.968 --> 40:30.845
And you're not about to give up now.

40:30.970 --> 40:34.270
Everything has its time.

40:34.349 --> 40:37.193
You know that, old friend
better than most.

40:37.268 --> 40:40.488
- The legend says more.
- Don't. There's no need for that.

40:40.563 --> 40:44.739
It says that the Face of Boe
will speak his final secret

40:44.859 --> 40:46.031
to a traveller.

40:46.110 --> 40:48.704
Yeah, but not yet.
Who needs secrets, eh?

40:48.821 --> 40:51.415
I have seen so much.

40:51.532 --> 40:54.160
Perhaps too much.

40:54.577 --> 40:57.080
I am the last of my kind

40:58.039 --> 41:02.590
as you are the last of yours, Doctor.

41:03.628 --> 41:06.006
That's why we have to survive.

41:07.340 --> 41:08.762
Both of us.

41:10.134 --> 41:11.636
Don't go.

41:11.719 --> 41:15.565
I must. But know this, Time Lord.

41:16.349 --> 41:19.728
You are not alone.

42:03.229 --> 42:05.231
All closed down.

42:05.314 --> 42:06.782
Happy?

42:06.858 --> 42:08.451
Happy-happy-

42:09.444 --> 42:11.538
New New York can start again.

42:11.612 --> 42:13.580
And they've got Novice Hame.

42:13.656 --> 42:18.253
Just what every city needs, cats
in charge. Come on, time we were off.

42:18.327 --> 42:21.456
But what did he mean, the Face of Boe?

42:21.539 --> 42:22.882
You are not alone?

42:22.957 --> 42:24.755
I don't know.

42:25.626 --> 42:28.630
You've got me. Is that what he meant?

42:30.631 --> 42:32.304
I don't think so.

42:33.217 --> 42:34.639
Sorry.

42:35.720 --> 42:36.892
Then what?

42:36.971 --> 42:40.145
Doesn't matter.
Back to the Tardis, off we go.

42:46.189 --> 42:49.989
- Right, are you staying?
- Till you talk to me properly, yes.

42:50.109 --> 42:52.077
He said, "Last of your kind."
What does that mean?

42:52.195 --> 42:56.826
- It really doesn't matter.
- You don't talk. You never say. Why not?

43:03.331 --> 43:04.878
It's the city.

43:08.252 --> 43:09.925
They're singing.

43:26.104 --> 43:27.697
I lied to you.

43:28.481 --> 43:30.199
'Cause I liked it.

43:31.567 --> 43:33.365
I could pretend.

43:34.028 --> 43:37.578
Just for a bit,
I could imagine they were still alive.

43:38.032 --> 43:40.376
Underneath a burnt orange sky.

43:43.246 --> 43:45.374
I'm not just a Time Lord.

43:47.375 --> 43:49.753
I'm the last of the Time Lords.

43:51.712 --> 43:54.932
The Face of Boe was wrong,
there's no one else.

43:55.466 --> 43:57.389
What happened?

44:09.814 --> 44:11.782
There was a war.

44:14.068 --> 44:15.570
A Time War.

44:16.320 --> 44:18.322
The last great Time War.

44:19.282 --> 44:22.877
My people fought
a race called the Daleks,

44:22.952 --> 44:26.081
for the sake of all creation,
and they lost.

44:28.332 --> 44:30.801
They lost. Everyone lost.

44:35.423 --> 44:37.300
They're all gone now.

44:38.217 --> 44:39.639
My family.

44:40.803 --> 44:43.306
My friends. Even that sky.

44:45.516 --> 44:48.360
You should have seen it,
that old planet.

44:52.815 --> 44:57.241
The second sun would rise in the south
and the mountains would shine.

44:59.363 --> 45:01.957
The leaves on the trees were silver.

45:02.909 --> 45:05.128
When they caught the light
every morning,

45:05.203 --> 45:07.581
it looked like a forest on fire.

45:09.332 --> 45:11.175
When the autumn came,

45:11.292 --> 45:15.513
a breeze would blow through
the branches. It sounded like a song...

45:27.642 --> 45:30.737
It's the Statue of Liberty.
I've always wanted to go to New York.

45:32.271 --> 45:35.616
It's the Depression, sweetie. Your heart
might break, but the show goes on.

45:35.691 --> 45:37.568
Hooverville mystery deepens.

45:37.652 --> 45:39.495
Arm yourselves. Come on!

45:39.612 --> 45:41.239
Who are we working for?

45:41.322 --> 45:42.915
Behold your masters.

45:42.990 --> 45:44.708
What do you mean, creatures?

45:46.327 --> 45:47.749
- What the hell was that?
- Doctor?

45:47.828 --> 45:49.171
Run!

45:50.373 --> 45:52.671
Hands in the air, and no funny business.

45:52.750 --> 45:54.093
Where's Martha?

45:55.503 --> 45:57.176
It's insane, it's inhuman!

45:59.382 --> 46:02.602
They always survive,
while I lose everything.
