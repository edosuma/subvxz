01:44.871 --> 01:46.953
Hollywood.

01:46.955 --> 01:49.373
A town where morality

01:49.375 --> 01:51.876
never crossed the city limits.

01:53.670 --> 01:57.675
You find there are things
that must be forgotten

01:58.884 --> 02:01.220
if you want to go on living.

02:02.137 --> 02:04.389
Death is a lonely business.

03:09.621 --> 03:10.787
We got a
beautiful day

03:10.789 --> 03:11.956
here in Hollywood.

03:11.958 --> 03:13.541
72 and sunny.

03:13.543 --> 03:14.624
Starting this day off right

03:14.626 --> 03:16.835
with some Lee Williams
and the Cymbals.

03:16.837 --> 03:18.296

You have
one new message.

05:10.576 --> 05:13.119
To listen to your messages,
press one.

05:13.121 --> 05:14.619
You've been avoiding me,

05:14.621 --> 05:16.080
okay, and I don't like it.

05:16.082 --> 05:18.749
I figured I'd come here to
wish you a happy birthday

05:18.751 --> 05:22.170
and keep me a piece of the
moist birthday cake, will you?

05:22.172 --> 05:23.504
All right, goodbye Mary.

05:23.506 --> 05:24.756
Happy birthday.

06:58.434 --> 07:02.145
This establishment has
been my pride and joy

07:02.147 --> 07:04.855
for well over 20 years.

07:04.857 --> 07:07.816
Tonight we are going to have
a very special gathering

07:07.818 --> 07:09.651
for my birthday.

07:09.653 --> 07:13.866
And, as always, I expect
you to serve and entertain

07:15.034 --> 07:16.369
in any capacity.

07:20.457 --> 07:22.038
Happy birthday, boss.

07:22.040 --> 07:25.792
I want you to get
this place looking nice.

07:25.794 --> 07:30.840
Maybe we'll go with a
different look for the night.

07:30.842 --> 07:32.967
Something tropical.

07:32.969 --> 07:34.927
A few American flags.

07:34.929 --> 07:37.054
Never took you for a patriot.

07:37.056 --> 07:39.891
Oh, I'm as American
as they come.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.977
A red-blooded capitalist.

07:47.066 --> 07:49.525
I got this new
camera, she's HD.

07:49.527 --> 07:50.400
Oh, okay.

07:50.402 --> 07:52.778
You know, I direct all
my own videos.

07:52.780 --> 07:53.987
Oh, I didn't know that.

07:53.989 --> 07:55.114
Yeah, you know, I'm the
creative type.

07:55.116 --> 07:56.698
I'm sensitive as well.

07:56.700 --> 07:58.576
Man, you really do it all.

07:58.578 --> 08:00.660
I do, baby, you have
no idea what I can do.

08:00.662 --> 08:01.496
Oh yeah?

08:01.498 --> 08:02.455
Yeah.

08:02.457 --> 08:03.538
Yeah, you gonna come
on my ship sometime?

08:03.540 --> 08:04.915
I'd love to come on your ship.

08:04.917 --> 08:05.749
Take me down under.

08:05.751 --> 08:06.751
Mhmm.

08:06.753 --> 08:08.335
Take me to deeper seas
than I've ever been to.

08:08.337 --> 08:09.836
Otto.

08:09.838 --> 08:12.088
You know you aren't
supposed to be back here.

08:12.090 --> 08:14.009
Vienna, you're on next.

08:20.475 --> 08:22.141
Otto, what happened
to your teeth?

08:22.143 --> 08:23.893
Oh, ma, only the
top ones are permanent.

08:23.895 --> 08:24.768
Look at this.

08:24.770 --> 08:25.936
Shit like five Gs in my mouth.

08:28.273 --> 08:29.773
You look good.

08:29.775 --> 08:31.818
Happy birthday,
how're you doing?

08:31.820 --> 08:32.818
I'm doing great.

08:32.821 --> 08:34.568
I was hoping that you'd
come by the club tonight

08:34.571 --> 08:36.488
and help set up.

08:36.490 --> 08:38.198
Oh, I can't, I'm so busy.

08:38.200 --> 08:40.241
I gotta be in the studio.

08:40.244 --> 08:41.202
I gotta go.

08:41.203 --> 08:43.663
I got a present for you I'm
gonna go get.

08:43.664 --> 08:46.040
Something beautiful I
got for you, you know?

08:46.042 --> 08:49.001
You know I love you,
best mom ever.

08:49.003 --> 08:50.461
I like your new suit.

08:50.463 --> 08:51.295
You like it?

08:51.297 --> 08:52.130
I love it.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.131
Yeah, I like yours as well.

08:53.133 --> 08:57.093
You know, I think it
represents my inner self.

08:57.095 --> 08:58.803
Your soul shines
right through it.

08:58.805 --> 09:00.847
Ah, you, I love you.

09:00.849 --> 09:02.305
I love you, too.

09:02.307 --> 09:03.891
Yo, I need like 50 bucks.

09:03.893 --> 09:07.270
Is it cool if I get it out of
the register on the way out?

09:07.272 --> 09:08.146
Speak to Ray.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.147
Oh, I love you,
you're so sweet.

09:10.149 --> 09:11.899
I love you, ma, happy birthday.

09:42.806 --> 09:43.640
Mary.

09:46.978 --> 09:47.811
Mary.

09:49.354 --> 09:50.190
Mary.

09:52.941 --> 09:55.859
What are
you doing in my club?

09:55.861 --> 09:56.695
Ha.

09:57.696 --> 09:59.197
"My club?"

09:59.199 --> 10:03.284
Is that how you're describing
it these days, Mary?

10:03.286 --> 10:04.119
"My club?"

10:06.873 --> 10:08.247
Why are you here?

10:08.249 --> 10:09.082
Mary.

10:12.045 --> 10:14.547
Baby, where's your cordiality?

10:16.633 --> 10:17.966
You used to just

10:19.760 --> 10:22.054
love the sound of my voice.

10:22.888 --> 10:26.390
Yeah, well those days
are long behind us, Duke.

10:26.392 --> 10:30.685
Yeah, I supposed
hanging out with all those

10:30.687 --> 10:32.688
pretty little girls,

10:32.690 --> 10:36.027
you forgot what a
real man is all about.

10:38.863 --> 10:40.445
Boys,

10:40.447 --> 10:41.281
girls,

10:42.325 --> 10:43.158
men,

10:44.409 --> 10:45.244
women,

10:47.080 --> 10:48.831
they're all the same.

10:54.336 --> 10:55.170
Mary.

10:58.007 --> 10:59.425
Baby, you owe me.

11:01.426 --> 11:04.971
You owe me big time.

11:04.973 --> 11:07.473
You borrowed and you borrowed

11:07.475 --> 11:09.434
and you took and you took

11:09.436 --> 11:12.522
and you come to the
end of your line.

11:15.191 --> 11:16.526
We had a deal.

11:18.652 --> 11:22.322
Well, you know Mary,
this is what you call

11:23.407 --> 11:24.783
a feudal society.

11:26.034 --> 11:27.453
And I am the lord

11:29.288 --> 11:31.664
and you are my
indentured servant

11:31.666 --> 11:32.499
and today

11:33.460 --> 11:35.543
you give my shit back.

11:35.545 --> 11:39.130
Business isn't what it
used to be in this town.

11:39.132 --> 11:39.965
So,

11:41.676 --> 11:43.802
what do you want from me?

11:45.305 --> 11:47.474
What do I want from you?

11:49.392 --> 11:50.727
I want the club.

11:57.901 --> 12:00.652
I built this club
from nothing.

12:03.864 --> 12:06.491
Mary, you're
doing it to yourself.

12:06.493 --> 12:10.077
Come on, you know this bogart
shit couldn't last forever.

12:10.079 --> 12:13.497
It always comes
at a price with you.

12:13.499 --> 12:16.501
I thought I had
already paid mine.

12:16.503 --> 12:19.628
And what a beautiful life

12:19.630 --> 12:22.466
you've been
given in return, Mary.

12:23.676 --> 12:25.677
Why all of this today?

12:26.553 --> 12:28.055
Why not yesterday?

12:29.224 --> 12:30.642
Why not tomorrow?

12:33.061 --> 12:35.852
Because today I
really feel like being

12:35.854 --> 12:37.941
a cruel ass motherfucker.

12:41.319 --> 12:42.152
Get out.

12:45.614 --> 12:46.448
Get out!

12:51.787 --> 12:53.203
Little Punk Rock Charlie

12:53.205 --> 12:55.497
is gonna come up
in here a little later.

12:55.499 --> 12:57.208
You know the kid, right?

12:57.210 --> 12:58.583
Punk Rock Charlie.

13:00.463 --> 13:02.921
He's gonna come over here.

13:02.923 --> 13:06.800
He's gonna say, "Mary,
I'm here for the keys."

13:06.802 --> 13:11.224
And you're gonna give him
the keys, aren't you, Mary?

13:12.225 --> 13:13.891
You know, Duke,

13:13.893 --> 13:18.438
when I came to this country,
I had nothing but a suitcase.

13:18.440 --> 13:21.232
You'll have to pry
the keys to this club

13:21.234 --> 13:23.235
from my cold dead hands.

13:25.028 --> 13:27.612
A lot more to
lose in this world

13:27.614 --> 13:32.077
than a neon sign and a couple
empty bar stools, Mary.

13:34.247 --> 13:35.373
Happy birthday

13:36.374 --> 13:37.207
to you.

13:39.002 --> 13:40.253
Happy birthday.

13:55.268 --> 13:56.894
What're you doing?

13:58.854 --> 14:01.731
You got to bend your
knees more or something.

14:01.733 --> 14:02.566
Stop.

14:04.067 --> 14:05.152
Try it again.

14:09.532 --> 14:10.781
What the fuck is that?

14:10.783 --> 14:12.910
Look like a damn pretzel.

14:14.454 --> 14:16.913
When she comes over to you,

14:16.915 --> 14:18.455
just relax.

14:18.457 --> 14:20.125
Look her in the eye.

14:24.755 --> 14:26.338
That's not how you do it.

14:26.340 --> 14:27.174
Practice.

14:29.134 --> 14:32.138
I don't think you even
like me anymore.

14:32.971 --> 14:36.516
How could you say
something like that to me?

14:36.518 --> 14:38.851
That hurts me when you
talk to me like that.

14:38.853 --> 14:41.145
Do you think I would
do this for any girl?

14:41.147 --> 14:41.980
Huh?

14:48.946 --> 14:52.365
What do I have to do
to prove it to you?

14:52.367 --> 14:53.200
Hmm?

14:56.745 --> 15:00.957
I remember when I first saw
you walking down the street.

15:00.959 --> 15:03.460
I said, "There goes my angel."

15:04.796 --> 15:06.631
My angel of Hollywood.

15:08.298 --> 15:11.843
I wouldn't do this
for any girl but you.

15:11.845 --> 15:13.220
That's the truth.

15:18.643 --> 15:19.476
Mary!

15:20.519 --> 15:22.978
How are you, darling?

15:22.980 --> 15:24.771
Not now, Percival.

15:24.773 --> 15:25.814
What do you mean, not now?

15:25.816 --> 15:27.525
I got some talent here for you.

15:27.527 --> 15:28.859
No.

15:28.861 --> 15:31.780
Please, Mar, it'll
take a minute.

15:33.365 --> 15:35.033
She's a special one.

15:43.167 --> 15:44.000
Hmmm.

15:44.002 --> 15:45.501
Mhmm.

15:45.503 --> 15:48.880
You have my attention, Percy.

15:56.388 --> 16:00.056
Thank you for
seeing me, Queen Mary.

16:00.058 --> 16:00.893
Sit.

16:10.445 --> 16:12.402
Something different about
her, you think so, Mary?

16:12.404 --> 16:14.488
Something, I don't know.

16:14.490 --> 16:16.991
What would you call,
innocence, I guess.

16:16.993 --> 16:18.867
There's one person in
this town who knows how to

16:18.869 --> 16:22.288
jumpstart a young girl's
career and that's you, Mary.

16:22.290 --> 16:24.915
Yeah, that's one
way to put it.

16:24.917 --> 16:26.958
Look at me, darling.

16:26.960 --> 16:28.421
What's your name?

16:33.759 --> 16:36.176
I didn't come all this way
for you not to fucking talk!

16:36.178 --> 16:37.012
Percy.

16:37.931 --> 16:40.848
Don't speak like
that in my club.

16:40.850 --> 16:42.018
Sorry, Mary.

16:43.769 --> 16:44.603
Grace.

16:45.479 --> 16:46.938
My name's Grace.

16:46.940 --> 16:48.396
Well that's a very pretty name

16:48.398 --> 16:50.817
and where are you from, Grace?

16:50.819 --> 16:52.275
Baker.

16:52.277 --> 16:53.944
It's in the desert.

16:53.946 --> 16:56.447
You know, I know
what it's like to leave home.

16:56.449 --> 16:59.282
I left mine too, many years go.

16:59.284 --> 17:00.284
Jesus Christ.

17:00.286 --> 17:02.495
What is this, fucking therapy?

17:02.497 --> 17:03.954
I just wanna know if
you wanna hire this girl

17:03.956 --> 17:05.704
to walk around with
titties hanging out

17:05.707 --> 17:07.500
and serving a few
drinks and whatever

17:07.502 --> 17:09.917
and then you could introduce
her to agents and managers

17:09.920 --> 17:11.252
and Hollywood types, whatever,

17:11.255 --> 17:14.257
but first you gotta throw me
a few bucks for finding her.

17:14.259 --> 17:15.093
Percy.

17:19.973 --> 17:21.307
Stand up, Grace.

17:27.271 --> 17:30.023
I want to get a
good look at you.

17:33.986 --> 17:35.610
Look at those
big eyes, Mary.

17:35.612 --> 17:37.070
Think she looks like
a deer or something.

17:37.072 --> 17:39.156
Don't she look
like a deer, Mary?

17:39.158 --> 17:44.164
Now, Grace, I need you to
take your clothes off, please.

18:00.597 --> 18:01.598
Turn around.

18:13.984 --> 18:15.318
How old are you?

18:15.320 --> 18:16.485
18.

18:16.487 --> 18:18.154
You liar.

18:18.156 --> 18:20.030
You didn't even see
her ass yet, Mary.

18:20.032 --> 18:21.866
Show 'em your ass, baby,
take off your pants, baby.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.617
What's the problem, Mary?

18:23.619 --> 18:24.868
She's a child.

18:24.870 --> 18:26.703
I just wanted to give
this girl a chance.

18:26.705 --> 18:27.621
Seize the opportunity.

18:27.623 --> 18:28.455
Carpe diem.

18:28.457 --> 18:29.373
Stay!

18:29.375 --> 18:30.582
Do not move!

18:30.584 --> 18:32.376
That's my property,
she comes with me.

18:32.378 --> 18:33.877
No, she's mine now!

18:33.879 --> 18:35.128
Once a whore,
always a whore, huh Mary?

18:35.130 --> 18:35.963
Get out!

18:35.965 --> 18:36.798
You sensitive old bitch.

18:36.800 --> 18:38.883
Get the fuck out!

18:38.885 --> 18:40.425
Get out!

18:40.427 --> 18:43.553
Get out you fucking asshole!

18:54.274 --> 18:56.733
What am I gonna do now?

18:56.735 --> 18:58.819
You'll be fine without him.

18:58.821 --> 19:01.155
I assure you that.

19:01.157 --> 19:02.365
Can I work for you?

19:02.367 --> 19:04.282
No, you're a minor.

19:04.284 --> 19:05.619
I'm yours now.

19:13.336 --> 19:15.505
I have nowhere else to go.

19:24.347 --> 19:26.099
I can do other stuff.

19:28.435 --> 19:30.270
I can sweep the floors

19:31.562 --> 19:35.147
and take people's
coats at the door.

19:38.695 --> 19:40.778
I'll pay you for a day's work.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.905
But it's a one day deal.

19:42.907 --> 19:44.281
Understood?

19:44.283 --> 19:45.657
Got it.

19:45.659 --> 19:47.409
Go speak to Ray outside.

22:47.509 --> 22:49.800
Be there at 10.

22:49.802 --> 22:50.969
Don't be late.

22:57.644 --> 22:59.184
See, I suffer from an allergy.

22:59.186 --> 23:02.105
An allergy of the body and
an obsession of the mind.

23:02.107 --> 23:03.146
Sometimes, you know,

23:03.148 --> 23:05.316
I can not differentiate
the truth from the false.

23:05.318 --> 23:07.693
I think that my alcohol
lifestyle seems to be

23:07.695 --> 23:09.153
the only normal one.

23:09.155 --> 23:11.822
And I'm really glad, man,
that God has put me right here

23:11.824 --> 23:14.032
with you guys and
I'm really glad that

23:14.034 --> 23:16.661
God opened another door for me.

23:16.663 --> 23:19.454
My name's Jim
and I'm an alcoholic.

23:19.456 --> 23:20.624
Jim.

23:21.834 --> 23:24.292
I really don't know
how I made it.

23:24.294 --> 23:26.462
I was such a fucking asshole.

23:26.464 --> 23:28.633
I would steal from people.

23:29.634 --> 23:33.010
I stole from myself,
I stole my own life.

23:33.012 --> 23:34.595
But I put those drugs away.

23:34.597 --> 23:36.180
I put that alcohol away.

23:36.182 --> 23:37.557
I put that anger away.

23:37.559 --> 23:38.933
I went and I got help.

23:38.935 --> 23:40.643

35:58.924 --> 36:01.592
You never break your bet.

36:01.594 --> 36:02.677

38:57.936 --> 39:00.647

I presume.

39:02.484 --> 39:03.690
Then you know what
I'm about to say

39:03.692 --> 39:06.777
should not be taken lightly.

39:06.779 --> 39:10.447
You have owed this organization
a great deal of money

39:10.449 --> 39:12.368
for quite some time now

39:13.453 --> 39:15.286
and as you already know,

39:15.288 --> 39:17.621
tomorrow you will
relinquish ownership

39:17.623 --> 39:19.458
of said establishment.

39:20.418 --> 39:24.170
We will give you one more
chance, Mary.

39:24.172 --> 39:27.592
I suggest you consider
it very carefully.

39:29.511 --> 39:32.719
We need you to
get rid of someone.

39:32.721 --> 39:35.389
An accountant who works for us.

39:35.391 --> 39:36.893
He talks too much.

39:39.436 --> 39:41.603
I'm a lot of things

39:41.605 --> 39:43.357
but I'm not a killer.

39:44.484 --> 39:47.192
Do you think you
have a choice here?

39:47.194 --> 39:49.487
I always have a choice.

39:49.489 --> 39:51.447
Then make the right one.

39:51.449 --> 39:54.282
All your debts will be forgiven.

39:54.284 --> 39:59.246
We'll still take the club but
you can have your son back.

39:59.248 --> 40:01.081
The future will be yours.

40:02.210 --> 40:03.378
Do it tonight.

40:04.462 --> 40:07.170
He will call you
for your services.

40:07.172 --> 40:09.257
He has predilection f
or young girls.

40:09.259 --> 40:11.175
But I don't have a gun.

40:56.014 --> 40:59.056

40:59.058 --> 41:01.058

41:11.779 --> 41:13.112

I've seen it in the movies.

41:38.348 --> 41:40.889

41:40.891 --> 41:41.935
Jesus Christ.

41:42.851 --> 41:43.768

No,

I can't sing anymore.

42:12.674 --> 42:13.965

42:13.967 --> 42:16.550
I can't hit a fucking
note anymore.

42:16.552 --> 42:17.634

55:22.630 --> 55:24.087

55:24.089 --> 55:25.840

Midnight?

59:59.364 --> 01:00:01.574
Leaving your own party?

01:00:01.576 --> 01:00:03.034
What am I gonna tell everyone?

01:00:03.036 --> 01:00:04.576
There's naked pussy
everywhere.

01:00:04.578 --> 01:00:07.748
I'm sure you'll keep

People like you and me, Ray,

01:00:18.467 --> 01:00:20.884
we don't have tomorrows.

01:00:49.958 --> 01:00:53.795
There's a few little
slices of la vida loca.

01:00:55.255 --> 01:00:56.256
Los Angeles,

01:00:57.257 --> 01:00:58.090
1973.

01:01:00.092 --> 01:01:03.344
I snap out of a warm,
comfortable heroin nod

01:01:03.346 --> 01:01:07.264
to terrible sounds flying
like fists at my head.

01:01:07.266 --> 01:01:09.308
Bang, bam, slam,

01:01:09.310 --> 01:01:10.768
crumbling the doors.

01:01:10.770 --> 01:01:12.103
Earthquake turbulence,

01:01:12.105 --> 01:01:13.520
rock in the walls.

01:01:13.522 --> 01:01:15.773
Noise swinging from the
chandelier

01:01:15.775 --> 01:01:19.944
like King Kong from the
fucking Empire State Building.

01:01:19.946 --> 01:01:21.779
And I'm caught like
an invisible ghost

01:01:21.781 --> 01:01:24.114
in a barroom brawl of noise

01:01:24.116 --> 01:01:26.452
in a very bad western movie.

01:01:27.578 --> 01:01:30.121
I look around for the
source of the confusion

01:01:30.123 --> 01:01:32.498
but the television is silent.

01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:34.500
This is the movie.

01:01:34.502 --> 01:01:37.962
The very bad shoot 'em
up movie of bad ugly life

01:01:37.964 --> 01:01:41.217
in the shadows of
downtown Los Angeles.

01:01:42.927 --> 01:01:43.928
Hey, Mary?

01:01:45.388 --> 01:01:47.223
I wanna be an actress.

01:01:48.141 --> 01:01:50.516
What's the fastest way
to make it in Hollywood?

01:01:50.518 --> 01:01:51.853
Take Fountain.

01:01:52.728 --> 01:01:54.061
What?

01:02:12.498 --> 01:02:15.791
You know, the sign used
to say "Hollywoodland."

01:02:15.793 --> 01:02:19.753
It was originally a
real estate development.

01:02:19.755 --> 01:02:23.674
Then a young actress came
along, Peg Entwistle.

01:02:23.676 --> 01:02:25.592
Like most young actresses,

01:02:25.594 --> 01:02:28.971
she came here with a
suitcase full of dreams.

01:02:28.973 --> 01:02:31.724
Soon enough,
the suitcase was empty.

01:02:31.726 --> 01:02:35.478
One night she climbed to the
top of the Hollywoodland sign,

01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:39.150
jumped off the H and
plummeted to her death.

01:02:40.235 --> 01:02:43.235
Everyone saw it as
bad publicity.

01:02:43.237 --> 01:02:46.029
They removed the
latter part of the name

01:02:46.031 --> 01:02:48.450
and thus, Hollywood was born.

01:04:01.857 --> 01:04:05.778
Fuck, why would she
send me someone like you?

01:04:09.531 --> 01:04:10.365
Oh.

01:04:11.618 --> 01:04:15.288
My, my, they do grown
them fast, don't they?

01:04:16.413 --> 01:04:17.746
How much?

01:04:17.748 --> 01:04:20.208
Oh, she's on the house.

01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:21.878
I owed Duke a favor.

01:04:24.214 --> 01:04:25.380
Did you now?

01:04:26.924 --> 01:04:28.340
Tell him thank you.

01:04:28.342 --> 01:04:29.469
Go on then.

01:04:35.516 --> 01:04:36.599
What?

01:04:36.601 --> 01:04:39.643
What time you
gonna be done with her?

01:04:39.645 --> 01:04:41.186
What's it matter to you?

01:04:41.188 --> 01:04:43.438
I have to drive her home.

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:45.983
She's not old enough.

01:04:45.985 --> 01:04:48.652
I get excited when you
say things like that.

01:04:48.654 --> 01:04:50.320
Well,

01:04:50.322 --> 01:04:53.493
you have until the cigarette
goes out.

01:04:57.163 --> 01:04:58.081
After that,

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:01.873
it's gonna cost you.

01:05:01.875 --> 01:05:03.669
Fine, now fuck off.

01:05:23.147 --> 01:05:26.400
You do know why you're here,
don't you?

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:30.527
I don't have to
tell you what to do,

01:05:30.529 --> 01:05:31.363
do I?

01:05:33.116 --> 01:05:34.617
Everything's okay.

01:05:36.201 --> 01:05:37.453
You like music?

01:05:38.830 --> 01:05:39.913

01:16:25.685 --> 01:16:27.518
Please, man,

01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:29.188

01:16:32.150 --> 01:16:35.234
Charlotte, would you do
me a little favor, please?

01:16:35.236 --> 01:16:36.527
Yeah?

01:16:36.529 --> 01:16:40.739
Would you go outside
and see if you see

01:16:40.741 --> 01:16:45.787
a little cornrow
Buddha-looking motherfucker?

01:16:47.164 --> 01:16:49.707
Send him in here
and tell him that

01:16:49.709 --> 01:16:51.044
momma wants him.

01:16:52.754 --> 01:16:53.920
Stay.

01:17:02.472 --> 01:17:06.893
I think it's a fine thing
you gave up cock for pussy.

01:17:13.232 --> 01:17:14.109
Oh, Mary.

01:17:17.277 --> 01:17:20.570
I thought you
gave up the bottle.

01:17:20.572 --> 01:17:22.241
You thought wrong.

01:17:23.325 --> 01:17:25.328
While you do this to me,

01:17:26.245 --> 01:17:27.371
your friends,

01:17:28.455 --> 01:17:29.289
for years,

01:17:30.583 --> 01:17:31.417
decades,

01:17:33.378 --> 01:17:35.293
once told me you loved me.

01:17:35.295 --> 01:17:37.755
I tell all my bitches that.

01:17:37.757 --> 01:17:39.841
I gave you money.

01:17:39.843 --> 01:17:41.759
A lot of money.

01:17:41.761 --> 01:17:44.177
A vouched for your ass.

01:17:44.179 --> 01:17:47.515
Put my neck on the line for you.

01:17:47.517 --> 01:17:49.269
And you never told me

01:17:50.437 --> 01:17:52.939
so much as, "Thank you, Duke."

01:17:54.566 --> 01:17:56.399
We had a deal

01:17:56.401 --> 01:17:59.152
all so I could have this.

01:17:59.154 --> 01:18:01.071
My own piece of the pie

01:18:02.365 --> 01:18:03.199
and you,

01:18:04.450 --> 01:18:08.452
you just wanna take
it all away from me.

01:18:08.454 --> 01:18:11.206
This is not
yours because, why?

01:18:12.624 --> 01:18:13.959
You borrowed it.

01:18:15.294 --> 01:18:18.421
And you can't borrow the
American dream.

01:18:18.423 --> 01:18:20.506
You gotta grab it,
you gotta snatch it,

01:18:20.508 --> 01:18:21.756
you gotta steal it,

01:18:21.758 --> 01:18:23.677
you gotta bleed for it.

01:18:25.012 --> 01:18:26.805
I've stolen for it.

01:18:28.725 --> 01:18:30.933
I have killed for it.

01:18:30.935 --> 01:18:31.770
Cool.

01:18:33.146 --> 01:18:36.900
Why don't you thank me
and step the fuck off?

01:18:38.692 --> 01:18:41.903
Because right now,
this desk is my desk

01:18:41.905 --> 01:18:46.114
and this establishment
is my establishment.

01:18:46.116 --> 01:18:48.703
And all them bitches out there,

01:18:53.374 --> 01:18:54.209
my pussy.

01:18:56.835 --> 01:18:58.045
Your keys, now.

01:19:06.094 --> 01:19:07.513
Pull the trigger.

01:19:08.431 --> 01:19:09.598
Give it to me.

01:19:54.518 --> 01:19:55.352
Otto.

01:19:56.980 --> 01:19:58.604
Baby.

01:19:58.606 --> 01:20:00.021
I'm so sorry.

01:20:00.023 --> 01:20:01.899
It was only business, baby.

01:20:01.901 --> 01:20:04.193
I did everything they
told me to do.

01:20:04.195 --> 01:20:05.112
Everything.

01:20:06.071 --> 01:20:08.738
Everything they told me to do

01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:10.075
and look at you.

01:20:11.369 --> 01:20:13.871
You're gonna be okay, my baby.

01:20:14.705 --> 01:20:17.206
You're gonna be okay.

01:20:17.208 --> 01:20:20.333
Let me take you to the hospital.

01:20:20.335 --> 01:20:22.295
All I need is a drink.

01:20:22.297 --> 01:20:24.214
I'll get you a drink.

01:20:25.299 --> 01:20:27.257
It's only business.

01:20:48.322 --> 01:20:49.156
Ray?

01:20:50.325 --> 01:20:51.948
Baby?

01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:53.118
Where are you?

01:20:54.161 --> 01:20:56.414
Why are all the lights off?

01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:16.077
I know it's my birthday

01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:20.371
and that's why most of you came.

01:22:20.373 --> 01:22:23.373
But I really brought
everyone here

01:22:23.375 --> 01:22:25.712
to say goodbye, old friends.

01:22:29.339 --> 01:22:32.718
I came to Hollywood to
become an actress.

01:22:34.928 --> 01:22:37.389
And after some minor successes

01:22:38.475 --> 01:22:40.558
and some serious failure

01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:43.521
and bags under my
eyes grew heavier,

01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:56.241
I eventually fell
into this way of life

01:22:59.411 --> 01:23:02.121
and I never looked back.

01:23:02.123 --> 01:23:04.165
I don't know what to do.

01:23:04.167 --> 01:23:06.751
You're not the only one.

01:23:06.753 --> 01:23:08.630
I have nowhere to go.

01:23:10.298 --> 01:23:12.924
Go wait outside with Josie.

01:23:12.926 --> 01:23:15.093
I'll be there in a minute.

01:23:22.977 --> 01:23:26.981
I've had the opportunity
to play business woman,

01:23:29.275 --> 01:23:30.899
teacher,

01:23:30.901 --> 01:23:32.443
mother,

01:23:32.445 --> 01:23:33.279
lover,

01:23:34.405 --> 01:23:35.240
gangster.

01:23:36.199 --> 01:23:38.698
We had quite a run.

01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:40.618
Yes we have.

01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:41.621
Yes we have.

01:23:45.834 --> 01:23:49.127
What do you wanna do
with all the decorations?

01:23:49.129 --> 01:23:50.670
Leave them up.

01:23:50.672 --> 01:23:53.133
It's not our problem anymore.

01:23:55.927 --> 01:23:57.762
Can I ask you a favor?

01:24:00.013 --> 01:24:02.223
Anything, baby.

01:24:02.225 --> 01:24:05.311
Let me close up for
nostalgia sake.

01:24:09.356 --> 01:24:10.441
Absolutely.

01:24:11.942 --> 01:24:12.944
Thank you.

01:24:24.164 --> 01:24:25.665
Someone once said,

01:24:26.999 --> 01:24:29.334
"People pay for what they do

01:24:30.210 --> 01:24:31.295
"and sew more

01:24:33.839 --> 01:24:37.884
"for what they've allowed
themselves to become

01:24:37.886 --> 01:24:40.554
"and they pay for it very simply

01:24:43.141 --> 01:24:45.185
"by the lives they lead."

01:24:48.312 --> 01:24:51.523
As I celebrate one
more year of living,

01:24:53.359 --> 01:24:55.445
I celebrate one more year

01:24:58.030 --> 01:24:59.364
closer to dying.

01:25:03.870 --> 01:25:06.122
Death is a lonely business.

01:25:10.709 --> 01:25:12.793
And now, my friends,

01:25:12.795 --> 01:25:15.130
I must ask you all to leave,

01:25:16.215 --> 01:25:19.009
for the night has
come to an end.
