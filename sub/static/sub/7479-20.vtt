WEBVTT

01:34.962 --> 01:36.486
Gotcha. Aisle 17.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.035
It slipped.

01:45.205 --> 01:46.797
They're in the warehouse.

01:46.974 --> 01:49.272
- Let's get them!
- Move!

01:49.443 --> 01:52.844
- Go and search the aisles.
- Right away, sir.

01:53.347 --> 01:55.941
Secure the northwest exit, corporal.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.778
Do it now. Move!

01:59.386 --> 02:00.978
Halt!

02:01.522 --> 02:03.149
Drop your weapon!

02:03.324 --> 02:04.723
Drop it!

02:06.894 --> 02:08.953
South exit! Now!

02:20.174 --> 02:21.539
- Go! Go! Go!
- Where's Asher?

02:21.709 --> 02:23.108
Drive!

02:48.335 --> 02:49.427
Oh, good morning.

02:49.636 --> 02:52.264
Now, that
is some serious retail therapy.

02:52.439 --> 02:53.599
You break up with that guy?

02:53.774 --> 02:54.866
She broke up with a guy.

02:55.042 --> 02:56.066
You don't know.

02:56.243 --> 02:59.542
You stopped eating tofu scrambles
and doing extra crunches at the gym.

02:59.713 --> 03:02.341
You know what that means?
So long, brother.

03:03.083 --> 03:05.574
These are your personalised
survival kits.

03:07.888 --> 03:10.152
- What's in these?
- You brought survival kits?

03:10.324 --> 03:12.622
No offense,
but survival kits are for urban sissies

03:12.793 --> 03:15.762
who don't know how to make
a flotation device out of a pair of pants.

03:15.929 --> 03:17.794
Or how to extract the venom
of a horned viper

03:17.965 --> 03:19.660
using only a twig and a shoelace.

03:19.933 --> 03:22.458
Or how to make a latte
without soy milk.

03:22.669 --> 03:25.866
Last night's tremor made me realize
you never know when big one will hit.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.904
There was an earthquake last night?

03:28.075 --> 03:29.804
Crack of dawn.
Shook me right out of bed.

03:29.977 --> 03:31.035
You guys didn't feel it?

03:31.211 --> 03:33.372
- I was on a run.
- Deep sleeper.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.208
You forget, I'm from California.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.612
We don't get out of bed
for anything less than a six.

03:37.785 --> 03:39.412
Okay, see, that is the problem.

03:39.586 --> 03:41.713
Everyone is so blasÅ¥
about earthquakes in this city.

03:41.889 --> 03:42.913
You need to be prepared.

03:43.090 --> 03:45.991
Know what? Kensi's got a point.
Doesn't hurt to have supplies on hand.

03:46.193 --> 03:50.152
I got a crank radio,
MRE's and some iodine tabs.

03:50.330 --> 03:51.695
Flashlight.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.324
Sweet KA-BAR.

03:56.303 --> 04:01.502
Uh, SPF-70 sunblock, ChapStick
and a seafoam-green Slanket?

04:01.708 --> 04:03.733
Really?
What are you trying to say here?

04:03.911 --> 04:08.280
Come on,
everyone knows you're a little delicate.

04:08.449 --> 04:10.610
I'm not delicate. I'm sensitive.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.911
And my lips get chapped
because we live in a desert.

04:14.288 --> 04:16.586
- Yeah, right.
- We got a case.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.486
Awesome air horn, Kens.

04:18.659 --> 04:22.459
Really, Kensi? Eric gets a
cool air horn and I get cuticle clippers?

04:22.629 --> 04:25.154
You whine like a baby
every time you get a hangnail.

04:25.332 --> 04:29.462
Okay, in all fairness,
that happened once and it really hurt.

04:31.472 --> 04:34.032
There was a break-in
at the Marine base

04:34.241 --> 04:35.799
at Pendleton last night.

04:35.976 --> 04:40.504
A secure facility housing
sensitive materials was compromised.

04:40.681 --> 04:43.309
This particular warehouse
serves as a depot

04:43.484 --> 04:45.315
for anything moving in or out
of the base.

04:46.186 --> 04:48.245
Interesting choice with the masks.

04:48.989 --> 04:50.684
God, I hate clowns.

04:51.758 --> 04:53.316
Portable ID card writer.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.358
They came prepared.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.126
Eric, can you access that computer?

05:00.300 --> 05:01.324
I'm working on it.

05:01.502 --> 05:04.198
It looks like they're
looking for something specific.

05:06.006 --> 05:09.066
- What is that?
- Night vision goggles.

05:09.276 --> 05:10.675
Nell, you said this was a depot.

05:10.844 --> 05:12.334
What else is inside there?

05:12.513 --> 05:15.744
Uh, everything from office furniture
to classified documents

05:15.916 --> 05:18.214
to sophisticated
laser-tracking systems.

05:18.385 --> 05:20.546
We gotta figure out
what these guys were really after.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.848
Someone gave them access
to this warehouse.

05:23.023 --> 05:26.322
This is starting to feel like it's more
than just selling black market goods.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.051
You know what that means.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.156
Time for a field trip.

05:30.330 --> 05:33.322
So they came in through the
roof, broke through the security gate,

05:33.500 --> 05:34.865
made their way down this aisle.

05:35.035 --> 05:37.595
Over here, the clown opened this case
of equipment

05:37.804 --> 05:39.669
but he dropped it,
which alerted the guards.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.831
They didn't really have time
to steal anything.

05:42.009 --> 05:45.035
Technically, the clown got away
with a pair of night vision goggles

05:45.212 --> 05:46.702
until he got shot.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.871
- Yeah.
- Searching the warehouse computer.

05:49.049 --> 05:52.041
It's basically an inventory list
of every item in the building.

05:52.219 --> 05:54.517
- Any idea what they were looking at?
- Negative.

05:54.688 --> 05:57.748
At any one time there's close
to 30,000 crates in that place.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.893
They were looking
for something specific.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.618
Yeah, but what?

06:01.828 --> 06:03.557
I don't know.

06:03.730 --> 06:06.062
We know a clown who does.

06:06.233 --> 06:07.962
Well, the Marines said
they couldn't wait

06:08.135 --> 06:10.228
to hand this guy over to us.

06:10.404 --> 06:12.235
That's never a good sign.

06:12.406 --> 06:14.636
You guys can't do this.
I should be in a hospital.

06:14.841 --> 06:16.968
Somebody should be
monitoring my leg.

06:17.144 --> 06:20.238
Oh, I'm feeling faint.
This is not a good sign.

06:20.414 --> 06:22.575
Bobby, they took the bullet out.
You're gonna be fine.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.881
You never heard of
hydrostatic shock?

06:25.052 --> 06:26.542
Sepsis?

06:26.720 --> 06:28.881
Oh, I feel feverish.
Do I look feverish to you guys?

06:29.056 --> 06:32.890
Okay, Bobby, listen, for the fifth time,
just give us a name.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.085
A name?
How can I think of a name?

06:35.262 --> 06:37.924
My whole life just flashed
right before my eyes.

06:38.098 --> 06:40.259
You guys ever get shot, huh?

06:40.434 --> 06:42.334
Oh, right,
probably, like, a hundred times.

06:42.502 --> 06:44.402
Well, guess what?
This is my first time.

06:44.571 --> 06:46.004
And let me tell you guys something,

06:46.173 --> 06:49.074
I didn't like it one bit. This has not been
a good day for me, guys.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.904
Hey, listen, Bobby,
I'm sorry that you got shot in the leg

06:52.079 --> 06:53.239
because that sucks.

06:53.413 --> 06:57.179
Maybe you should have thought of that
before you tried to steal weapons.

06:57.384 --> 07:00.182
The sooner you give us a name,
the sooner we all leave this room.

07:00.387 --> 07:01.411
It's that easy.

07:01.588 --> 07:02.987
- Is this place spinning?
- My God.

07:03.156 --> 07:05.647
Feel like I'm on a freaking
merry-go-round, like at the fair.

07:05.826 --> 07:07.953
That was in one of my flashbacks
when I got shot.

07:08.295 --> 07:10.422
Coney Island, my mom, my dad.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.024
Know what? This is their fault.
This is their fault.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.691
I wouldn't be here
if I had a happy childhood.

07:15.902 --> 07:17.529
Oh, my shrink
even called them "toxic."

07:17.704 --> 07:20.867
- Bobby!
- Oh, Lordy, see, honestly guys,

07:21.041 --> 07:22.474
oh, I don't feel good.

07:22.643 --> 07:26.170
The painkillers are wearing off.
You think I can get a glass of water?

07:26.346 --> 07:28.405
Got cotton mouth.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.776
Oh, my God.

07:34.488 --> 07:35.887
I cannot take this anymore.

07:36.056 --> 07:39.492
This guy has been speaking non-stop.
You heard it.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.184
You should be used to that.

07:41.361 --> 07:44.057
What? Was that aimed at me?

07:44.231 --> 07:46.461
You saying I talk too much?
That what you're implying?

07:46.633 --> 07:49.227
Because, uh, I've never got
that complaint before.

07:49.436 --> 07:50.903
People say that I don't talk enough.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.732
They say, "You're charming.
Talk more.

07:52.939 --> 07:55.499
You should double down
with that talking because..."

07:56.843 --> 07:58.674
I'm gonna shut up.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.871
This guy doesn't wanna talk to us.

08:02.049 --> 08:04.176
Maybe he wants to talk
to someone else.

08:04.718 --> 08:05.844
Kumani?

08:06.019 --> 08:08.385
- Kumani.
- Kumani?

08:08.555 --> 08:10.887
Kumani. I don't know what that is.

08:11.058 --> 08:14.516
But, uh, you guys can have
all your secret words to yourself,

08:14.695 --> 08:16.219
I'll just be...

08:16.496 --> 08:17.656
What is it?

08:20.000 --> 08:23.436
Mr. Asher, Richard Brown.
I'm with the State Department.

08:23.603 --> 08:27.869
This is Kumani Adembayo.
He's with the Nigerian Embassy.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.168
You need help moving money
out of your country?

08:30.343 --> 08:31.776
The documents.

08:31.978 --> 08:33.570
What's going on?

08:33.746 --> 08:35.214
Sign here.

08:35.381 --> 08:36.746
What's this?

08:36.917 --> 08:39.977
This is just a transfer of custody.

08:41.020 --> 08:44.889
It turns out one of the crates that you
broke into was Nigerian property.

08:45.058 --> 08:49.518
The Federal Republic of Nigeria
takes vandalism very seriously.

08:50.263 --> 08:52.390
If you could just give me
your John Hancock there.

08:52.566 --> 08:55.228
What?
No, no, no, I'm not signing that.

08:57.571 --> 08:59.095
Yeah, well, um...

08:59.272 --> 09:02.366
Well, it's really more of a formality
for the government.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.033
- I'll just go ahead.
- You are right-handed?

09:05.545 --> 09:06.876
Yeah, what does that matter?

09:07.147 --> 09:09.809
Penalty for vandals and thieves
in my country.

09:10.016 --> 09:11.881
We take the dominant hand.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.209
He is all yours.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.753
What? I'm an American citizen.
I have rights here.

09:16.923 --> 09:19.892
Yes,
but with the Patriot Act there's...

09:20.060 --> 09:23.621
Let go of me. This is not cool.
Okay, okay, okay.

09:23.797 --> 09:25.765
Okay, I'll give you his name.

09:25.932 --> 09:27.422
It's Stan King.

09:28.301 --> 09:29.461
That will do.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.131
Stan King.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.636
Thirty-five years old
and a world-class thief

09:33.807 --> 09:36.139
suspected of some
of the biggest jewelery and art heists

09:36.309 --> 09:37.401
in the last decade.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.272
FBI's been after him for years.

09:39.446 --> 09:41.676
Born into a wealthy family
in San Francisco.

09:41.848 --> 09:44.339
He's got a college degree
from Berkeley and majored in...

09:44.785 --> 09:47.253
Surprise... Art History.

09:47.420 --> 09:51.254
He's charming, cunning
and, until now, flawless

09:51.424 --> 09:54.359
in his execution
of high-end gallery and museum jobs.

09:54.561 --> 09:58.827
All right. So, what is Thomas Crown
doing breaking into Pendleton?

09:58.999 --> 10:01.263
Diversifying his business.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.595
Black market military equipment?

10:03.770 --> 10:06.068
It's pretty lucrative these days.

10:06.339 --> 10:10.503
Something tells me
we'll soon find out.

11:07.634 --> 11:09.192
Put your hands up.

11:13.573 --> 11:16.940
Turn around slowly.

11:22.215 --> 11:23.648
Lose the mask.

11:39.064 --> 11:40.656
Keep moving.

11:42.301 --> 11:44.895
I shoot you,
nobody even hears you die.

11:45.070 --> 11:49.530
Maybe. But you're gonna mess up
your antique Persian rug.

11:49.708 --> 11:51.266
How did you get in here?

11:52.611 --> 11:55.375
Skylight.
Everybody forgets to alarm those.

11:56.181 --> 11:58.649
Why do bad guys always have
such awesome houses?

11:58.817 --> 12:01.809
What's the matter, Deeks?
You're not feeling your loft?

12:01.987 --> 12:04.182
This guy's
got his own hobbit's shire.

12:04.556 --> 12:05.784
And my motion sensors?

12:06.592 --> 12:07.752
Took them out.

12:07.927 --> 12:09.724
How did you know the combination
of my safe?

12:10.062 --> 12:11.324
I didn't.

12:11.497 --> 12:14.295
You cracked a two-lock entry system
in seconds.

12:14.466 --> 12:15.763
Where did you learn to do that?

12:16.902 --> 12:19.132
Misspent youth.

12:19.305 --> 12:21.967
- Actually, I talked her through it.
- Yeah, we never get credit.

12:22.141 --> 12:23.972
- Or the glamour.
- Beautiful place.

12:25.344 --> 12:28.006
Which is totally overrated
because I love my job.

12:28.614 --> 12:29.945
Love it.

12:30.115 --> 12:31.173
How did you know about me?

12:31.350 --> 12:33.614
Don't try and tell me
that you staked me out.

12:33.786 --> 12:35.651
- Bobby.
- Asher?

12:35.821 --> 12:37.982
He said you made him
wear a clown mask.

12:39.525 --> 12:41.356
Yeah, that's because he's a bozo.

12:41.527 --> 12:43.791
He showed up at my doorstep
with a bullet in his leg.

12:44.363 --> 12:48.595
I thought, I'll let him bleed out
but he owes me money, so...

12:49.835 --> 12:53.430
He told you that I owed him money
so you came to get it from me.

12:53.605 --> 12:54.765
Well, you're a thief.

12:54.940 --> 12:57.932
Figured you're not going
to keep your cash in a bank. Heh.

12:59.044 --> 13:00.102
What's your name?

13:00.512 --> 13:02.002
Lisa Roberts.

13:02.448 --> 13:05.781
Okay, Lisa,
why don't you take me to Bobby?

13:05.951 --> 13:07.543
I wanna hear the story from him.

13:07.753 --> 13:09.618
Are you gonna give me the money
he owes me?

13:09.788 --> 13:11.449
Oh, you're gutsy.

13:11.623 --> 13:13.181
You have no idea.

13:13.359 --> 13:15.384
Too bad I won't get a chance
to find out.

13:16.128 --> 13:18.255
Well, it's your loss.

13:19.031 --> 13:20.692
I would make it worth your while.

13:21.066 --> 13:24.297
I'm sure
that would be a wonderful few hours.

13:25.037 --> 13:27.198
And then you'd rob me.

13:27.840 --> 13:31.071
You're right, I do like my rug.
Get off it.

13:31.710 --> 13:33.405
- All right, let's go.
- No, no.

13:33.579 --> 13:35.206
She hasn't said
the distress word yet.

13:35.381 --> 13:38.009
- Isn't getting shot distressing enough?
- She's okay.

13:38.183 --> 13:39.650
She's my partner, I know her voice.

13:39.818 --> 13:41.979
- Something's not right.
- She's seducing him.

13:42.154 --> 13:43.883
Maybe you never heard
that voice before.

13:46.425 --> 13:50.156
I'm worth a Shiraz oriental,
if I'm not mistaken.

13:50.329 --> 13:51.728
Oh, impressive.

13:51.897 --> 13:54.297
But you're wrong.
It's just a cheap repro.

13:55.334 --> 13:56.733
Really?

13:58.404 --> 13:59.666
Well, it's very good.

13:59.838 --> 14:04.434
It's flat-woven, hand-dyed wool,
500 knots per square inch at least.

14:06.545 --> 14:10.106
I don't wanna shoot you.
Just take me to Asher.

14:10.449 --> 14:11.882
And we'll talk about my money.

14:12.317 --> 14:13.909
Okay.

14:19.124 --> 14:21.558
You shouldn't leave
your valuables out.

14:27.399 --> 14:28.764
All good.

14:29.034 --> 14:32.902
Okay, so just to clarify, when we said
that Kensi was gonna seduce him

14:33.072 --> 14:34.972
what exactly did we mean by that?

14:35.140 --> 14:38.234
- You're jealous?
- What? Of Kensi?

14:38.410 --> 14:39.638
She's my partner.

14:39.978 --> 14:42.378
Okay, whatever you say.

14:43.415 --> 14:45.713
- She's my partner.
- Heh-heh-heh.

14:46.251 --> 14:49.743
Seriously, though,
I don't like this guy.

15:25.924 --> 15:27.619
All set, Mr. Beale?

15:27.793 --> 15:29.454
Multiple cameras are set up.

15:29.628 --> 15:31.926
I got the perimeter covered.

15:36.468 --> 15:39.767
- Asher in place?
- Yeah, but he's nervous.

15:46.645 --> 15:49.205
Nice digs you got here, Asher.

15:49.515 --> 15:51.642
I'm house-sitting.

15:52.317 --> 15:54.615
Well, it looks like somebody's
got some moves.

15:54.786 --> 15:55.980
How did you get out of there?

15:56.155 --> 15:58.282
Yeah, no thanks to you.
They shot me.

15:58.457 --> 15:59.890
The job has its hazards.

16:00.058 --> 16:01.992
I thought we were supposed
to be partners, man.

16:02.161 --> 16:04.061
You know,
all for one and one for all.

16:04.229 --> 16:05.457
That's The Three Musketeers.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.826
Look, I did everything
just like you asked, you know?

16:08.000 --> 16:10.525
I wanted to be the devil
but no, no, you had to be the devil.

16:10.702 --> 16:13.466
I had to be the stupid clown.
And I did not want to be the clown,

16:13.639 --> 16:15.800
- but you always make me the clown.
- Bobby, shut up.

16:16.208 --> 16:17.732
Tell me about your friend, here.

16:19.244 --> 16:22.839
Lisa.
We met on a job in Marina del Rey.

16:23.015 --> 16:24.983
Yeah, it was a jewel heist.

16:25.150 --> 16:26.344
Easy in and out.

16:26.518 --> 16:29.885
The hotel heiress, she had a taste
for the Burmese sapphire.

16:30.055 --> 16:32.683
I was supposed to give Lisa her cut

16:32.858 --> 16:35.019
but Daddy ran into bad luck
at the tables in Vegas.

16:35.194 --> 16:36.320
You're bad luck, Bobby.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.190
You still owe me
for the two jobs we did.

16:38.363 --> 16:42.094
- So you sent her to rob me?
- You robbed him?

16:42.734 --> 16:44.361
I didn't say to rob him. Tell him that.

16:44.536 --> 16:46.766
Yeah, all right.
That part was my idea.

16:48.006 --> 16:50.839
But since it was my money
I don't really consider it stealing.

16:51.009 --> 16:53.500
Hey, man, you know me.
I would never steal anything from you.

16:53.679 --> 16:54.976
I have morals.

16:56.548 --> 16:58.379
Are you satisfied now?

16:58.550 --> 17:00.040
Very.

17:04.690 --> 17:07.454
- Eric, what happened?
- King just shot Asher.

17:07.626 --> 17:08.887
Why did you shoot him?

17:09.060 --> 17:11.723
Like I said, the job has its hazards.

17:12.431 --> 17:15.559
Get rid of him and then we'll talk.

17:15.733 --> 17:18.999
Oh, I might even have a job for you.

17:25.077 --> 17:28.137
He's leaving. Stay with Kensi.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.245
We'll take King.

18:19.396 --> 18:21.057
You okay?

18:23.200 --> 18:24.531
I didn't even have time to react.

18:24.702 --> 18:26.192
That's because
it came out of nowhere.

18:26.370 --> 18:28.634
I should have seen it coming.
My instincts are all off.

18:28.806 --> 18:31.036
I completely misjudged King.

18:32.510 --> 18:34.808
Why don't you hang out in the car.

18:34.979 --> 18:36.503
- I'll take care of...
- No, I'm fine.

18:36.680 --> 18:39.342
You only say you're fine
when you're not fine.

18:43.888 --> 18:45.549
Fine.

18:46.357 --> 18:48.882
As in, I'll wait out front for you.

19:02.072 --> 19:04.438
- Yes?
- Hetty, nail King on murder charges.

19:04.608 --> 19:06.075
We need to arrest him now.

19:06.243 --> 19:09.679
We can bring him in for murder
anytime, Mr. Deeks.

19:09.847 --> 19:13.715
For now, let's just see
where he goes and what he does.

19:13.884 --> 19:16.682
I want to know what he was after
at that Marine base

19:16.854 --> 19:18.719
and who, if anyone, hired him.

19:18.889 --> 19:22.848
This could be a matter
for National Security.

19:23.027 --> 19:26.019
I'll send someone
to take care of Asher's body.

19:26.196 --> 19:27.356
And Kensi?

19:27.531 --> 19:28.759
Keep an eye on her.

19:29.266 --> 19:30.893
Okay.

19:57.628 --> 19:59.425
What's wrong with this picture?

20:01.065 --> 20:02.896
The fact
that King just murdered someone

20:03.067 --> 20:04.932
and now he's ordering a latte?

20:06.270 --> 20:08.101
We're here, two cars back.

20:09.506 --> 20:11.133
Kensi, you good?

20:12.142 --> 20:14.372
Yep. Good.

20:23.821 --> 20:25.789
He's got company.

20:31.962 --> 20:33.896
Girlfriend?

20:34.264 --> 20:36.095
Eric. Sending you some photos.

20:36.266 --> 20:38.393
- Need an ID on the redhead.
- Got it.

20:42.306 --> 20:44.035
Looks like they're talking business.

20:54.284 --> 20:55.945
Short meeting.

20:57.521 --> 20:59.182
I got the redhead.

20:59.356 --> 21:01.290
Of course you do.

21:10.834 --> 21:13.029
Any luck with the mystery woman?

21:13.203 --> 21:14.500
Still tracking her.

21:14.672 --> 21:16.833
Oh, boy.

21:17.474 --> 21:20.466
Problem, Miss Jones?

21:20.644 --> 21:22.339
Yeah, major.

21:22.513 --> 21:24.845
Looks like someone's been digging
through Kensi's legend.

21:25.015 --> 21:28.576
And it's more than just a look-see.

21:28.752 --> 21:30.049
They're online now.

21:30.220 --> 21:33.189
Whoever it is has gone through her
last five years of income tax returns

21:33.357 --> 21:35.416
and is now sifting
through her employment records.

21:35.592 --> 21:36.718
It must be King.

21:36.894 --> 21:40.591
Well, if it is, he's looking for something
very specific in Kensi's backstopping.

21:40.764 --> 21:42.322
King's a pro.

21:42.499 --> 21:45.195
He's not gonna be satisfied
until he knows for sure

21:45.369 --> 21:48.338
that Kensi is who she says she is.

21:48.505 --> 21:50.871
Well, our records go back
about eight years

21:51.041 --> 21:54.010
but at the rate he's looking, we're
gonna run out of material very soon.

21:54.178 --> 21:57.773
Then I'd suggest you both
get back to work quickly.

21:57.981 --> 21:59.175
Gentlemen,

21:59.349 --> 22:03.342
I need you to put an end
to King's web surfing. Immediately.

22:03.520 --> 22:04.748
We're on it.

22:18.602 --> 22:20.729
- Deeks, stall her.
- Got it.

22:27.611 --> 22:28.873
Oh, my knee!

22:29.880 --> 22:31.541
- Oh, you just...
- Are you all right?

22:31.715 --> 22:34.047
Oh, my gosh. What are you doing?
You just crashed into me.

22:34.218 --> 22:36.652
Oh, I am so sorry.
You came out of nowhere.

22:36.820 --> 22:38.117
- Not even looking?
- No, I was.

22:38.288 --> 22:40.381
- I was walking, you just pulled back.
- I'm sorry.

22:40.557 --> 22:41.990
- You on your phone?
- No.

22:42.159 --> 22:44.923
- Were you Twittering?
- I don't know what that is.

22:45.763 --> 22:47.993
King is still blowing
through Kensi's cover.

22:48.165 --> 22:51.726
We're going as fast as we can
but he's just not stopping.

22:54.104 --> 22:55.765
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:55.939 --> 22:58.430
- Watch where you're going, man.
- You just stopped.

22:58.609 --> 23:00.975
I stopped? You're texting,
not watching where you're going.

23:01.145 --> 23:02.476
What is your problem? Look.

23:02.646 --> 23:04.944
Sorry about that, man.
Guy knocked into me from behind.

23:05.115 --> 23:07.515
I wouldn't have if you didn't stop
for no reason.

23:07.684 --> 23:09.584
Really? So this is my fault?

23:09.753 --> 23:11.584
You had the coffee, okay?
I'm just saying.

23:11.755 --> 23:13.985
Look, I'm sorry about this.
I'm gonna get you a towel.

23:14.158 --> 23:15.182
I got it.

23:15.359 --> 23:17.589
Hey, dude,
I spilled a Red Bull on my laptop.

23:17.761 --> 23:19.441
- Get out of here.
- Fried the motherboard.

23:19.596 --> 23:22.429
Get this checked out. My cousin's
got a shop on Pico, a computer shop.

23:22.599 --> 23:23.691
- I'll call him.
- I'm good.

23:23.867 --> 23:25.698
- I'll give you his number.
- I'm good.

23:26.770 --> 23:28.965
I'd get that checked out.

23:29.306 --> 23:31.968
I swear, I checked my mirror.
I just didn't see you.

23:32.142 --> 23:33.166
My career is over.

23:33.343 --> 23:35.868
You might as well just hand
another endorsement to Beckham.

23:36.079 --> 23:37.603
Are you a footballer?

23:37.781 --> 23:39.612
Well, this is America,
so we call it soccer.

23:39.783 --> 23:41.045
But, yeah, I just got drafted.

23:41.218 --> 23:44.085
- Awesome until seven seconds ago.
- Oh, my God.

23:46.089 --> 23:48.649
Guys, the woman is Patricia Dunn.

23:48.826 --> 23:52.626
She's a British national working in L.A.
For the Hasperg Auction House.

23:52.796 --> 23:53.990
Connection to King?

23:54.832 --> 23:55.856
Big time.

23:56.033 --> 23:58.331
She sold several pieces
of expensive artwork for him.

23:58.502 --> 24:01.630
- Mr. Deeks, bring her in.
- Okay.

24:02.239 --> 24:05.003
- Okay, what?
- Okay, we need to talk.

24:05.509 --> 24:06.601
L.A.P.D.

24:20.990 --> 24:23.959
I have known guys like Stan before.

24:24.127 --> 24:27.995
They're charming and they're seductive
but they're dangerous.

24:28.164 --> 24:31.531
He killed his partner,
a guy named Bobby Asher,

24:31.701 --> 24:33.225
shortly before he met with you
today.

24:33.436 --> 24:35.495
Oh, my God.

24:36.039 --> 24:37.734
We know
that King's got you involved

24:37.940 --> 24:40.431
in fraudulent activities
at the auction house.

24:41.978 --> 24:45.505
Tell us what you know and when we
hand you over to the L.A.P.D.,

24:45.682 --> 24:47.877
we will make sure
that they know you cooperated.

25:02.965 --> 25:04.523
When I met Stan,

25:05.601 --> 25:08.263
he was everything I ever wanted.

25:08.471 --> 25:10.029
You met him at the auction house?

25:10.206 --> 25:12.071
Two years ago.

25:12.875 --> 25:16.367
We were dating about three months
when he asked me for a favor.

25:16.979 --> 25:19.174
He wanted me to change
the provenance of a painting

25:19.348 --> 25:21.782
to lower its value,
so he could buy it at auction.

25:21.984 --> 25:23.679
And you did it.

25:24.020 --> 25:26.386
He claimed
it was because he loved the painting.

25:26.556 --> 25:28.683
And then he turned around
and sold it for a profit.

25:29.292 --> 25:33.592
From there, it went
to falsifying manifests,

25:33.763 --> 25:36.197
altering insurance claims.

25:36.365 --> 25:39.129
By the time I realized
he was just using me, I...

25:39.302 --> 25:41.202
You were in too deep.

25:42.905 --> 25:44.463
When you met with him today,

25:44.640 --> 25:47.370
you tried to give him
this blank bill of lading.

25:48.411 --> 25:50.242
He contacted me
a couple of weeks ago

25:50.413 --> 25:52.973
to say he needed my help
getting something out of the country.

25:53.149 --> 25:55.947
- What did he want you to move?
- He didn't say.

25:56.119 --> 25:58.246
He ever mention anything
about smuggling weapons?

25:58.588 --> 25:59.987
Never.

26:00.156 --> 26:02.386
Why didn't he take the paperwork
from you today?

26:02.792 --> 26:05.386
He said he no longer needed
my assistance.

26:06.062 --> 26:07.086
So that's it?

26:07.764 --> 26:10.062
He also said

26:10.600 --> 26:12.898
this was going to be his last job.

26:15.938 --> 26:19.806
And then we'd celebrate

26:20.042 --> 26:21.805
with a holiday in the Caribbean.

26:28.184 --> 26:30.152
How did it go with Miss Dunn?

26:30.319 --> 26:32.480
I believe her.
She's made mistakes in the past.

26:32.655 --> 26:35.021
We handed her over to L.A.P.D.
For processing.

26:35.191 --> 26:38.319
Eric, any leads on what King
was looking for at the warehouse?

26:38.494 --> 26:41.429
Well, the blank bill of lading
is actually tied to a cargo container

26:41.597 --> 26:43.360
scheduled to depart for Hong Kong
tomorrow.

26:43.566 --> 26:46.467
So I took a shot. I ran a vector search
of the warehouse records

26:46.636 --> 26:49.935
against anything having to do
with China, and I found this.

26:50.439 --> 26:52.168
Li Tan is a Chinese dignitary

26:52.341 --> 26:54.366
suspected
of infiltrating our stealth program.

26:54.577 --> 26:56.169
He was deported two weeks ago.

26:56.345 --> 26:58.870
Tan's personal belongings
are being held in the warehouse

26:59.081 --> 27:00.810
pending a forensic review.

27:00.983 --> 27:02.211
Hey, guys.

27:02.385 --> 27:06.321
Okay, so we've been looking
for another angle into King.

27:06.489 --> 27:07.649
And?

27:08.524 --> 27:10.355
Turns out
several of King's partners died

27:10.526 --> 27:13.324
shortly after they completed
their suspected heist.

27:13.496 --> 27:16.124
So his MO is to get rid of his partners
after the job's done.

27:16.599 --> 27:18.123
Just like he did with Asher.

27:21.137 --> 27:22.365
It's King.

27:24.807 --> 27:26.968
- Hey.
- Hey. You get rid of Asher?

27:27.143 --> 27:29.236
Of course I got rid of Asher.
You owe me.

27:29.412 --> 27:31.073
Good. My apologies.

27:31.247 --> 27:33.977
Got a job.
Meet me in an hour at my house.

27:34.150 --> 27:35.481
Near the parking garage.

27:35.651 --> 27:38.142
- Okay.
- Don't be late.

27:40.756 --> 27:42.519
He wants me to meet him
at his house.

27:42.692 --> 27:44.057
Said he has a job for me.

27:44.227 --> 27:46.525
- When?
- One hour.

27:46.829 --> 27:48.694
This guy is a cold-blooded killer.

27:48.865 --> 27:51.333
You could be walking into a trap.

27:56.539 --> 27:59.030
I'm gonna be with you
every step of the way.

27:59.208 --> 28:01.768
Even if you don't see me,
I'll be there.

28:02.078 --> 28:04.512
He caught me off-guard once.
It's not gonna happen again.

28:04.680 --> 28:06.341
I know.

28:09.652 --> 28:10.949
Let's go.

28:11.153 --> 28:12.711
Okay.

28:39.482 --> 28:40.540
We good?

28:41.384 --> 28:43.079
She's in.

28:45.321 --> 28:47.312
- Wow, you clean up well.
- Thanks.

28:47.490 --> 28:49.253
Come on out to the pool.

28:49.425 --> 28:52.326
- Do you want a drink?
- No, thank you. I'm fine.

28:52.495 --> 28:53.962
- What's the job?
- Heh.

28:54.130 --> 28:57.327
Not so fast. Don't you think we should
get to know each other better first?

28:57.733 --> 29:01.225
The least I know about you
the better it is for the both of us.

29:01.404 --> 29:03.998
You're assuming
that we shouldn't trust each other.

29:04.340 --> 29:06.604
I don't trust anyone.

29:07.009 --> 29:08.772
Especially not you.

29:08.945 --> 29:10.708
I saw you kill your last partner.

29:11.013 --> 29:13.811
Well, Bobby worked for me
but I would hardly call him my partner.

29:13.983 --> 29:16.076
Okay, whatever he was.

29:16.652 --> 29:21.214
Get in, get out, get paid.

29:21.924 --> 29:25.826
But wouldn't it be far more interesting
to have a drink and tell each other lies.

29:26.295 --> 29:28.820
Soda water, ice.

29:28.998 --> 29:30.863
Wow, living on the wild side.

29:32.635 --> 29:33.659
So your choice.

29:33.836 --> 29:36.862
We talk about infrared motion sensors
or we share our sad stories

29:37.039 --> 29:39.633
about how we started stealing
for a living.

29:39.809 --> 29:43.301
Well, motion sensors fascinate me.

29:43.479 --> 29:47.108
- That tells me one thing about you.
- Oh, yeah? What's that?

29:47.283 --> 29:48.944
You definitely need to get out more.

29:49.118 --> 29:50.142
We got company.

30:03.065 --> 30:05.499
Eric, we got two cars.

30:05.668 --> 30:07.135
Need ID on the plates.

30:07.303 --> 30:09.897
- Uploading them now, Eric.
- Got it.

30:20.583 --> 30:23.211
Okay, first car is registered
to Michael Connor.

30:23.386 --> 30:26.822
Connor did time
for grand theft and forgery.

30:26.989 --> 30:30.322
He's suspected of robbing a gallery
in Monaco with King.

30:30.493 --> 30:32.222
And the second car?

30:32.828 --> 30:35.592
It's registered to Kevin Morris.

30:35.798 --> 30:37.527
Arrested for armed robbery.

30:37.700 --> 30:40.032
King's putting
the band back together.

30:50.446 --> 30:52.846
Guys, they've got Patricia Dunn.

30:53.015 --> 30:54.949
I thought she was handed over
to L.A.P.D.

30:55.117 --> 30:58.018
She was.
They must have released her.

30:58.187 --> 30:59.347
She could blow Kensi's cover.

30:59.522 --> 31:01.183
No, maybe not.

31:01.357 --> 31:02.915
She should know
Kensi is on her side.

31:03.092 --> 31:05.925
If she stays cool, Kensi will be okay.

31:06.462 --> 31:07.554
Glad you could make it.

31:07.897 --> 31:10.229
There's some cold drinks
and some food inside.

31:10.399 --> 31:11.457
Go in and help yourself.

31:11.634 --> 31:14.467
I haven't been up here in a while.
You've been doing some decorating.

31:14.637 --> 31:16.195
I have.

31:17.206 --> 31:19.936
Give you a tour later.
It's good to see you.

31:20.109 --> 31:21.542
Kev.

31:24.914 --> 31:27.041
So thanks for coming.

31:27.216 --> 31:29.411
I didn't exactly have much choice,
did I?

31:30.252 --> 31:32.618
Yeah, sorry about that.

31:33.355 --> 31:35.983
Okay. L.A.P.D. Released her.

31:36.158 --> 31:38.217
Charges pending.

31:38.394 --> 31:42.592
Well, just relax, go inside, have a drink,
okay? I'll join you in a minute.

31:44.100 --> 31:47.069
And don't worry,
I'll explain everything to you.

31:48.370 --> 31:49.928
All right.

32:05.488 --> 32:06.785
Hi.

32:12.761 --> 32:15.594
- Whoa, what just happened?
- I don't know. I completely lost her.

32:17.800 --> 32:20.394
Eric, we're aborting mission.
We're going in.

32:22.411 --> 32:24.276
Stay down!

33:01.275 --> 33:02.867
Three victims.

33:03.044 --> 33:04.068
Only one woman.

33:04.245 --> 33:05.940
But it's not Kensi.

33:06.147 --> 33:08.274
No sign of her or King.

33:12.019 --> 33:15.045
She suffered fourth degree burns
over her entire body.

33:15.223 --> 33:17.054
But her facial structure's
still intact enough

33:17.225 --> 33:19.455
that we should be able to ID her.

33:22.797 --> 33:23.889
It's Patricia.

33:26.768 --> 33:28.030
We gotta find this guy.

33:28.403 --> 33:29.961
Hey, guys.

33:35.276 --> 33:39.076
Kensi was in the water.
She could have survived.

33:41.115 --> 33:43.242
The blast was more flammable
than concussive.

33:43.418 --> 33:46.080
That would explain
why we lost contact with her.

33:56.564 --> 33:58.555
King's computer.

33:59.500 --> 34:00.592
What do you think?

34:01.135 --> 34:02.295
Job for Eric.

34:06.641 --> 34:08.505
Any luck?

34:08.708 --> 34:10.734
Well, the shell is completely fried.

34:10.911 --> 34:13.277
But the motherboard
is miraculously more or less intact.

34:13.447 --> 34:14.915
Only problem is it's water damaged.

34:15.081 --> 34:17.607
I'm trying to extract everything I can
from the hard drive.

34:17.784 --> 34:20.275
Long story short,
it's not looking good.

34:21.322 --> 34:24.655
Well, keep at it, Mr. Beale.

34:29.496 --> 34:32.489
So I searched through all the traffic
cam footage in a two-mile radius

34:32.667 --> 34:35.329
around the time of the explosion
but got nothing.

34:35.503 --> 34:37.835
That hill to the south,
they could have escaped that way.

34:38.005 --> 34:41.168
Right. There are several fire roads
from King's house

34:41.342 --> 34:43.036
up into the canyons
without cameras,

34:43.244 --> 34:45.337
so it's possible
he could've gotten away with Kensi.

34:45.513 --> 34:47.003
King is cleaning house.

34:47.181 --> 34:49.706
He's gotten rid of his entire crew,
including Patricia.

34:49.884 --> 34:51.351
Everyone but Kensi.

34:51.518 --> 34:54.283
Maybe he's on to us, maybe he's
gonna use Kensi as a hostage.

34:54.688 --> 34:56.953
Either that
or he needs her for her skills.

34:57.123 --> 34:58.318
For one last job.

34:58.493 --> 35:00.552
He told Patricia
the job was canceled.

35:00.761 --> 35:03.389
No, he told her
he no longer needed her services.

35:03.564 --> 35:05.156
He didn't say the job was canceled.

35:05.333 --> 35:07.995
I got it. King received an e-mail
from Li Tan,

35:08.169 --> 35:12.128
the Chinese spy whose belongings
are being held at the warehouse.

35:13.007 --> 35:14.304
This was sent two days ago.

35:14.475 --> 35:16.375
It's a blank message
with an attachment:

35:16.544 --> 35:17.636
A Chinese dragon.

35:17.812 --> 35:21.043
Seems like a lot of work
for a tacky green dragon statue.

35:21.215 --> 35:25.151
Unless, it isn't the dragon statue,
but what's inside.

35:25.553 --> 35:27.578
One last job.

35:52.713 --> 35:54.340
Wait.

35:55.216 --> 35:57.081
They've installed PIR sensors.

35:57.251 --> 36:00.049
Okay, recalibrate the settings.
It'll give us three minutes.

36:00.221 --> 36:01.688
Go.

36:13.067 --> 36:14.557
Go.

36:25.212 --> 36:26.873
What exactly are we looking for?

36:29.984 --> 36:31.576
Here.

37:17.098 --> 37:18.690
Let's go.

37:32.613 --> 37:34.376
Freeze! Federal agents!

37:34.548 --> 37:36.812
Put your hands up
where we can see them.

37:38.786 --> 37:40.117
You good, Kens?

37:43.724 --> 37:46.693
- Better now.
- Oh, man.

37:53.434 --> 37:54.662
Let me go or she's dead.

37:54.835 --> 37:57.668
Drop the weapon.
You got nowhere to run.

37:57.838 --> 37:59.465
Drop it!

38:02.743 --> 38:04.574
Okay,
will one of you shoot this guy?

38:05.312 --> 38:07.007
Stay back.

38:11.152 --> 38:12.585
Nice try.

38:18.225 --> 38:21.820
See that right there,
that's for hitting my partner.

38:25.066 --> 38:28.331
Like you said, job has its hazards.

38:30.504 --> 38:32.972
- Oh, that really hurts, huh?
- Yeah.

38:34.508 --> 38:36.874
So the FBI has been
working the case from their end.

38:37.044 --> 38:39.376
It turns out that Tan,
the Chinese spy who hired King

38:39.547 --> 38:42.107
had a contact at the DoD,
an engineer.

38:42.283 --> 38:45.343
He was working on a highly classified
stealth bomber project.

38:45.519 --> 38:49.182
He embedded the stealth bomber
technology inside the jade statue.

38:49.356 --> 38:50.687
Which is why the Chinese

38:50.858 --> 38:53.588
wanted King to retrieve the statue
before the U.S. Government

38:53.761 --> 38:56.730
conducted its forensics review
and found the hidden intel.

38:56.897 --> 38:58.091
Did they arrest the leak?

38:58.265 --> 39:01.894
Officers are on their way outside
Arlington, Virginia as we speak.

39:02.737 --> 39:05.604
I just got off the phone
with SECNAV.

39:05.773 --> 39:09.539
The U.S. Government
will be returning the dragon statue

39:09.710 --> 39:12.975
along with the rest of Tan's belongings
in the morning.

39:13.147 --> 39:16.446
- What about the stealth technology?
- It's taken care of.

39:16.617 --> 39:19.780
Let's just say
that the Chinese stealth bombers

39:19.954 --> 39:23.219
won't be wheels up
for some time to come.

39:23.924 --> 39:26.290
Good job, everyone.

39:26.460 --> 39:29.224
And good night.

39:29.396 --> 39:31.261
- Good night.
- See you, guys.

39:31.432 --> 39:32.797
Night.

39:32.967 --> 39:36.425
You know, I don't know about the rest
of you but I'm starving.

39:36.604 --> 39:38.094
Dinner on you, G?

39:38.439 --> 39:40.907
Anywhere but Chinese.
You guys in?

39:41.075 --> 39:43.737
Rain check. Can't really chew.

39:43.911 --> 39:47.506
I think I'm gonna go home and spend
some quality time with my Slanket.

39:47.681 --> 39:49.171
Suit yourselves.

39:49.350 --> 39:53.616
You know, I'm thinking of bone-in fillet,
maybe a juicy porterhouse.

39:53.788 --> 39:56.348
- Always trying to milk it.
- Is it truffle season yet?

39:56.557 --> 39:59.082
A couple of ground rules here.
No weird expensive fungi.

39:59.260 --> 40:01.160
No eggs
that don't come from a chicken.

40:01.328 --> 40:03.296
No Scotch
that's older than you or me.

40:03.464 --> 40:05.591
I can still order a seafood tower.

40:06.567 --> 40:09.627
- You okay, Kens?
- I'm fine.

40:11.839 --> 40:14.205
Good. I'm good.

40:15.342 --> 40:18.505
When I can feel my jaw,
I'll be really good.

40:38.599 --> 40:40.829
- What are you?
- Was gonna call but I was out front,

40:41.001 --> 40:43.731
so it seemed kind of, uh, redundant.

40:45.105 --> 40:46.732
Come in.

40:47.875 --> 40:50.639
Wow, you just finish taping
an episode of Hoarders?

40:52.379 --> 40:54.847
- Is there a reason why you're here?
- I've got dinner.

40:55.015 --> 40:57.506
I got me a burger
and I got you a smoothie.

40:57.918 --> 40:59.351
I'll take a beer.

40:59.520 --> 41:00.646
Okay.

41:00.821 --> 41:03.381
Really, Top Model?
Why does every girl love this show?

41:03.557 --> 41:05.218
Because it is awesome.

41:05.392 --> 41:06.484
How is that a TV show?

41:07.127 --> 41:09.027
They're about to start the judging.

41:10.865 --> 41:13.925
Mm. Look at this, huh?

41:14.501 --> 41:16.867
Can't get any better than this.

41:17.137 --> 41:19.401
Turkey burger. Top Model.

41:21.242 --> 41:23.073
Can you open my beer for me,
please?

41:38.359 --> 41:39.883
Thank you.

41:44.164 --> 41:46.689
Sweet.
