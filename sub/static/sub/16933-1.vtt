00:30.864 --> 00:34.448
Young woman: All I ever wanted
was a father who loved me,

00:34.743 --> 00:37.780
someone fo protect me
if I was ever in trouble,

00:38.080 --> 00:40.287
someone fo guide me
through life.

00:46.588 --> 00:49.751
It seemed like a good idea
al the time.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.712
I wasn't sure if he'd pay
or even show up.

00:54.680 --> 00:56.466
But it was never
about the money.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.290
Man on phone: I'm here.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.390
- Alexander t. Hope?
- Yes

01:31.425 --> 01:34.212
- do you have the money?
- I brought the money.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.172
I'd like to speak
to my daughter.

01:36.471 --> 01:39.383
We're not interested
in what you'd like, Mr. hope.

01:39.683 --> 01:44.677
Follow directions and stick
to the plan. Am I clear? - Yes

01:44.980 --> 01:47.722
you see the barge
approaching the bridge?

01:48.025 --> 01:49.025
I see the barge.

01:51.570 --> 01:53.526
Move to the center
of the bridge.

01:53.822 --> 01:56.188
Throw the case on the barge.

01:56.491 --> 01:58.356
We'll call you
with further instructions.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.571
How do I know
you'll release her?

02:00.871 --> 02:02.782
You don't.

02:07.294 --> 02:11.207
Man: Shit. Cellular phone.

02:11.506 --> 02:14.213
What do you expect, a silver platter?
It's probably hers.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.064
Daughter:
It did surprise me that...

02:35.364 --> 02:37.776
With my father's
questionable business deals,

02:38.075 --> 02:40.066
he would involve the police.

02:40.369 --> 02:42.860
I guess he was using them
to retrieve the money.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.232
Have the chopper stand by.
I want them ready.

03:14.528 --> 03:17.270
- Chopper, stand by.
- Pilot: Chopper standing by.

03:26.164 --> 03:27.950
You have the money.
Where's my daughter?

03:28.250 --> 03:32.789
In the trunk of her car,
fifth-level parking, 352 harbor

03:33.088 --> 03:35.454
3-5-2 harbor.
“We have the location.

04:01.199 --> 04:05.067
Daughter: Everything was carefully
worked out and going according fo plan.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.743
There was only one thing that I
never could have anticipated.

05:34.417 --> 05:36.328
There's the green beemer.

05:41.132 --> 05:43.498
That's our car. Go, go, go!

06:01.069 --> 06:03.401
Officer: All units, I'm
following a green BMW.

06:03.697 --> 06:08.282
License: Echo-tango-hotel-one.
Headed... where are we?

07:18.730 --> 07:20.971
Officer on loudspeaker:
You! Sef it down.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.810
Put your hands on your head.

07:23.109 --> 07:25.771
- Man! It's not mine.
Officer: Put it down.

07:34.329 --> 07:37.321
Jesus! What happened
to the chopper support?

07:37.624 --> 07:40.582
Officer: It's still with the barge.
We lost the money.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.993
For Christ's sake, how?

07:43.296 --> 07:44.957
Chopper blew it away.

07:47.425 --> 07:48.915
We lost the money,

07:49.219 --> 07:51.505
we lost the hostage
and we lost the perps.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.012
I don't believe this

09:37.243 --> 09:38.653
Thank you.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.787
This guy says he's expected.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.540
- Raymond!
- He's not on our security list.

09:45.835 --> 09:49.999
Mr. Perkins is a colleague and friend
of the family. - Good to see you.

09:50.298 --> 09:52.209
I'm Emily's uncle.

09:52.509 --> 09:55.467
We're not going house-to-house
until they move.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.673
What do you know about "they"?

09:57.972 --> 10:00.634
We saw a man drive her BMW away.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.175
Dark hair, Caucasian,
couldn't tell how old.

10:03.478 --> 10:07.346
- He wasn't apprehended?
- No_

10:07.649 --> 10:11.517
What was your name? - I'm sure these
gentlemen are doing everything...

10:11.820 --> 10:14.186
Within their power
would you excuse us?

10:14.489 --> 10:16.480
It's been a trying
and emotional time.

10:16.783 --> 10:19.024
I'd like a moment
alone with Mr. Perkins.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.693
Sure we'll be outside.

10:31.089 --> 10:33.330
The fools also lost the ransom.

11:40.867 --> 11:41.867
Hi

11:56.341 --> 11:58.622
Raymond: I don't understand
why you brought them into this

11:58.801 --> 12:01.292
kidnappers insist
the police be kept out.

12:01.596 --> 12:04.838
Otherwise, you get an ear in the
mail or something like that.

12:05.141 --> 12:06.677
I have a bigger problem.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.967
I have to close a deal
in Brussels on the 25th.

12:09.270 --> 12:10.635
I have to be there in person.

12:10.939 --> 12:13.305
Must be important.

12:13.608 --> 12:18.819
They're all important. This
one's more important than most.

12:19.113 --> 12:22.605
Are there people who don't
want you to make this deal?

12:22.909 --> 12:24.991
There always are.

12:25.286 --> 12:26.822
Could be they're behind this.

12:27.121 --> 12:30.409
Figure you'd be more concerned
with Emily than a meeting.

12:31.918 --> 12:33.783
Wouldn't you think that?

12:35.421 --> 12:37.662
Put a lid on this.

12:37.966 --> 12:40.173
I don't want it
turning into a circus.

12:40.468 --> 12:41.503
Not now

12:44.472 --> 12:46.679
you should have called me first.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.886
Hey, Vincent. What can I get ya?

12:53.189 --> 12:54.850
Just a cup of coffee.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.019
You gonna be long?

12:58.319 --> 13:00.810
Maybe two minutes.
Give me two minutes.

13:08.246 --> 13:10.658
Hit the power button.
That turns the vcr on.

13:10.957 --> 13:13.699
A lot of cops around here today.
You notice?

13:15.461 --> 13:16.997
Yeah don't mind them

13:17.297 --> 13:20.039
they do it twice a year
before an election.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.798
Rousting crack dealers.

14:29.327 --> 14:31.158
Shit.

14:31.454 --> 14:34.070
Man on phone: Make sure
you get the tape in.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.080
Hit pause and record.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.333
Oh, sir!

14:39.629 --> 14:43.998
Hang on a second. - My wife is in the
hospital, and I love her very much.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.915
Just hit the record button

14:46.219 --> 14:48.255
I've been waiting
for god knows how long.

14:48.554 --> 14:51.136
- I gotta run.
- Long. Long.

14:51.432 --> 14:54.139
- I gotta go. Come over.
- Thank youl!

14:56.521 --> 14:58.227
Thank you. Thank you.

15:05.071 --> 15:06.799
Louise, can you put
that thing in a paper cup?

15:06.823 --> 15:08.939
Greg, we got a problem.

15:09.242 --> 15:12.029
- Did you get the "g"?
- Yeah. I got the "g."

15:12.328 --> 15:16.617
What's the problem? - I need you
right away. Come on. Right away.

15:33.141 --> 15:34.221
Hope residence.

15:34.517 --> 15:37.259
- Can I talk to my father?
- Miss Emily.

15:38.146 --> 15:40.478
- Cell phone again?
- Shit.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.933
Emily? Where are you?

15:46.404 --> 15:48.065
You tell me.

15:48.364 --> 15:50.480
I don't know. I don't know.

15:50.783 --> 15:54.275
I'm in a warehouse.
There's cars everywhere.

15:55.913 --> 15:58.871
Now you're in trouble.
Guess who?

15:59.167 --> 16:02.330
Uncle ray?
What are you doing there?

16:02.628 --> 16:05.370
Lookin' for ya. Missed ya.

16:05.673 --> 16:08.210
Ray, I've been kidnapped.

16:08.509 --> 16:12.878
Your father's concerned.
I've never seen him so upset.

16:13.181 --> 16:14.591
I don't know what to do

16:14.891 --> 16:18.850
I can't get out. Everything's
locked and there's bars everywhere.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.760
Maybe I could talk fo someone?

16:21.063 --> 16:23.896
"Someone"? "Someone" who?

16:24.192 --> 16:26.228
Whoever's letting you
use the telephone.

16:26.527 --> 16:28.607
How could I get to a phone
if there was someone here?

16:28.821 --> 16:31.403
I need help.

17:35.763 --> 17:37.754
Sir! Can I have my car keys?

17:41.227 --> 17:43.639
- Can I have my keys?
- Hold on.

17:46.440 --> 17:49.056
That's my hand going in
my pocket. All right?

17:56.534 --> 17:57.944
Just give me my keys
and let me go.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.824
- How the hell did you get out?
- I1t popped open.

18:03.124 --> 18:05.456
You can have my car.
Just let me go.

18:09.130 --> 18:10.130
Don't look at me.

18:13.759 --> 18:16.045
I'm not gonna hurt you.
All right?

18:16.345 --> 18:19.758
- You're not gonna hurt me?
- I don't even carry a gun.

18:21.559 --> 18:24.517
You're sure? Positive.

18:25.771 --> 18:26.977
All right.

18:40.494 --> 18:42.405
Stop. That's not cool.

18:42.705 --> 18:44.036
Give me that.

18:49.170 --> 18:50.660
Now, that was a good kick.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.999
All right? I don't wanna fight.

18:56.469 --> 18:57.629
I don't wanna fight.

18:59.930 --> 19:03.138
I'm not gonna hurt ya.
All right?

19:11.651 --> 19:13.516
Are you mental?

19:13.819 --> 19:15.980
I told you, I don't wanna fight.

19:29.794 --> 19:32.251
It wasn't me
who put you in that trunk.

19:32.546 --> 19:35.413
All right? You gotta cool it.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.047
I have to pee.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.047
I'm gonna do this
on my own, thank you.

19:40.346 --> 19:41.756
You'll get an infection.

19:42.056 --> 19:43.421
There's stuff in the cabinet.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.680
What stuff? “Stuff in a can.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.927
Asshole.

19:51.482 --> 19:52.642
You don't know where you are,

19:52.900 --> 19:56.734
you don't know who I am
and you're cuffed to my pipe.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.894
Honey, don't do me like that

19:59.198 --> 20:01.689
you're done?
You don't want to play?

20:09.834 --> 20:10.869
Vinny!

20:11.711 --> 20:13.201
It's spinach!

20:15.840 --> 20:17.922
I got your money.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.833
- I got half what we got for the Porsche.
- All right.

20:21.137 --> 20:23.093
What's the problem? Sweet.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.179
Listen, man.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.305
We got a problem. Shoot.

20:27.601 --> 20:30.138
We got a big problem.

20:30.438 --> 20:32.770
- All right.
- I get in the car.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.981
- I start the car...
- Is that the car?

20:36.277 --> 20:38.609
- Excellent.
- Starts like a champ.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.485
Vinny, I love this color.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.612
I isten to me now.

20:42.908 --> 20:45.320
I take care of my man.
I'm out of the lot.

20:45.619 --> 20:50.488
Boom! Two undercover cars right
on my tail from the get-go.

20:50.791 --> 20:52.656
- Cops?
- Red cherries and everything.

20:52.960 --> 20:56.293
I'm driving against traffic
and changing lanes.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.875
- Gosh!
- I don't know which way is up.

20:59.175 --> 21:02.793
- Adrenaline is pumping hard.
- What happened with the cops?

21:03.095 --> 21:05.131
I lost 'em. Great.

21:05.431 --> 21:07.296
You got nothing to worry about.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.387
Whoa! Did we order a Ferrari?

21:10.686 --> 21:12.017
Did we order this?

21:12.313 --> 21:15.646
- You're a genius. Black and beautiful.
- Greg, Greg.

21:15.941 --> 21:19.229
Stop jerking around, man.
The problem ain't over.

21:19.528 --> 21:21.735
What are you talking about?

21:22.031 --> 21:25.148
Right. Right.
I bring the car in.

21:26.243 --> 21:27.904
I put it on the hoist.

21:28.204 --> 21:29.535
I ook at me I look.

21:29.830 --> 21:32.913
The damn thing is moving.

21:33.209 --> 21:35.074
It's on a hoist.
It's gonna move.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.993
I bring the car down.
I open the trunk.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.754
Bang! Don't do it!
Wham! You know?

21:41.050 --> 21:43.382
I find the owner in the trunk.

21:43.677 --> 21:45.542
The owner?

21:45.846 --> 21:47.677
Emily: Let me out, asshole!

21:47.973 --> 21:49.679
Who's that?

21:49.975 --> 21:51.966
That's the owner in the trunk.

21:55.105 --> 21:58.893
- Oh, you gonna uncuff me now?
- Jesus!

21:59.193 --> 22:00.933
- Christ!
- You gonna uncuff me?

22:01.237 --> 22:05.196
Good-looking. - Are you aware
your friend has kidnapped me?

22:05.491 --> 22:07.197
You're an accomplice.

22:07.493 --> 22:09.905
Hey! You gonna uncuff me?

22:10.204 --> 22:12.911
I'm not an accomplice.
This is your doing.

22:13.207 --> 22:15.573
- What's your problem?
- No problem.

22:15.876 --> 22:17.996
You graduated from the same
school of public speaking.

22:18.212 --> 22:20.669
Good sense of humor. Jesus!

22:21.549 --> 22:23.756
Unbelievable. Hey!

22:26.887 --> 22:28.093
So she's seen your face?

22:28.389 --> 22:30.721
Yeah. But I'd rather
get rid of her...

22:31.016 --> 22:32.631
Then drive that car anywhere.

22:32.935 --> 22:35.392
Did she see the place
when she got here?

22:35.688 --> 22:37.394
She was in the trunk.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.555
How did she get out?

22:39.859 --> 22:41.941
I don't know

22:42.236 --> 22:44.943
I found the keys
to the handcuffs on her.

22:45.239 --> 22:47.446
- She doesn't know where we are?
- Right.

22:47.741 --> 22:50.949
Put her in the trunk and drive
her someplace. -

22:51.245 --> 22:53.907
- where should I dump her?
- I don't know.

22:54.206 --> 22:57.414
Take her to a show.
Buy her drinks.

22:57.710 --> 22:58.790
Come on. Take her anywhere.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.618
Take her outside the city.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.304
There goes the medicine cabinet.

23:12.600 --> 23:16.934
Be careful of that girl.
She scares the crap out of me.

23:17.229 --> 23:19.265
She's quite a challenge.

23:19.565 --> 23:21.055
Hey, Greg. Yeah.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.396
Put the guys back
a couple of hours?

23:25.529 --> 23:27.065
Call me. Call me!

23:31.035 --> 23:32.616
We're about to wrap this up.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.823
- Get in the trunk.
- I'm not getting in.

23:35.122 --> 23:38.034
- I can't have you seen.
- I'm not getting in.

23:38.334 --> 23:39.790
I'm not gonna hurt you.

23:40.085 --> 23:44.499
You are, by sticking me in.
Don't look at me.

23:44.798 --> 23:46.959
We can do this the easy
way or the hard way.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.625
I thought you weren't
gonna hurt me?

23:51.055 --> 23:53.842
I won't unless I do it
the hard way.

23:54.141 --> 23:57.850
- What's the hard way?
- It's harder than the easy way.

23:58.145 --> 24:00.852
- What's gonna happen to my car?
- Forget your car.

24:01.148 --> 24:05.517
You're gonna get hurt in a minute.
Don't look at me.

24:05.819 --> 24:08.652
You told me under the easy way
you weren't gonna hurt me.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.688
Are you not gonna hurt me?

24:10.991 --> 24:13.824
Or are you a liar
like everyone else?

24:14.119 --> 24:15.734
I'm not gonna hurt you.

24:16.038 --> 24:17.358
Could you please
get in the trunk?

24:17.623 --> 24:20.239
Can't I just wear this cap?
I can't see.

24:20.542 --> 24:22.407
Hold up some fingers.
I can't see.

24:22.711 --> 24:25.373
How stupid do you
think I am, huh?

24:26.966 --> 24:28.831
How stupid is there?

24:29.134 --> 24:30.715
Not too many. Get in.

24:38.936 --> 24:40.597
Give me this.

24:40.896 --> 24:43.888
You didn't have to do that.

24:44.191 --> 24:45.397
All right.

24:55.369 --> 24:57.735
- Put that out.
- Put what out?

24:58.038 --> 25:01.246
Put that damn cigarette out
on the ashtray on the door.

25:01.542 --> 25:03.248
All right. All right.

25:16.473 --> 25:19.385
All right. I'll put
the seat belt on you.

25:19.685 --> 25:21.425
Don't take me too far.

25:26.191 --> 25:29.274
You're gonna keep your head
between your legs.

25:29.570 --> 25:31.561
- Understand?
- I have plans tonight.

25:31.864 --> 25:33.775
Understand? Yes.

25:35.325 --> 25:37.065
Let's be friendly, now.

25:39.329 --> 25:41.320
You have plans tonight, huh?

25:41.623 --> 25:44.285
Emily: I made them
before I was kidnapped.

26:01.935 --> 26:03.641
What are you looking for?

26:03.937 --> 26:06.644
Names and phone numbers
and so on.

26:06.940 --> 26:09.431
Anything to do with
her life these days.

26:10.611 --> 26:13.819
Hmm. She have a boyfriend?

26:14.114 --> 26:16.230
If she does, she's never
introduced him to me.

26:20.788 --> 26:22.153
I ook at that.

26:23.415 --> 26:24.951
When was this?

26:25.250 --> 26:28.333
She was, I guess, ten.
Just got her black belt.

26:30.297 --> 26:32.504
- I wasn't there.
- I know

26:34.218 --> 26:35.754
hey, look at that.

26:38.806 --> 26:41.513
Could you believe it?
She had that framed.

26:42.726 --> 26:43.726
Yeas

26:45.437 --> 26:46.597
hmm

26:49.274 --> 26:52.061
this could be
one of Emily's games.

26:52.361 --> 26:55.023
Really? What did I do this time?

26:56.240 --> 26:57.901
Forget her birthday?

26:58.200 --> 26:59.861
She takes me
for a million dollars.

27:00.160 --> 27:03.027
I don't think it's about
your money, Alexander.

27:08.293 --> 27:10.249
Emily: I don't want you
messing with my car.

27:10.546 --> 27:12.252
I have few
sentimental attachments,

27:12.548 --> 27:15.381
and that car
is one of them. Okay?

27:17.511 --> 27:19.672
I'm gonna puke
all over your car.

27:19.972 --> 27:22.509
- Stay.
- It's been long enough.

27:25.477 --> 27:27.513
I'm getting it back.

27:27.813 --> 27:30.725
I don't wanna find
you've painted it shit-brown.

27:34.444 --> 27:37.277
How much are you and your faggot
boyfriend gonna get for it?

27:37.573 --> 27:39.154
Forty dollars crack-head fee?

27:40.492 --> 27:41.652
Why did you steal it?

27:45.164 --> 27:48.531
You wouldn't know about
pride of ownership.

27:48.834 --> 27:50.916
You wouldn't know what loss is.

27:52.462 --> 27:54.202
You steal

27:54.506 --> 27:57.213
probably get a hard-on doing it.

27:57.509 --> 28:00.251
All part of the
live-on-the-razor's-edge,

28:00.554 --> 28:03.091
never-say-die world
of Grand Theft Auto.

28:03.390 --> 28:04.721
Let me tell you something,

28:05.017 --> 28:08.134
I once stole a Ferrari
with a chihuahua in the back.

28:08.437 --> 28:10.519
He made less noise than you do.

28:11.398 --> 28:14.515
He speaks.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.780
No one knows shit about hope.

28:22.075 --> 28:24.282
- We know he's rich.
- Dirty money.

28:25.704 --> 28:28.741
Money in banks in the Caribbean.
Swiss accounts.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.908
When that money blew away,
he didn't give a shit.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.577
A million bucks
didn't mean anything.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.916
Maybe he doesn't
show his feelings.

28:37.216 --> 28:38.626
I ike a fish.

28:38.926 --> 28:41.793
There's a warehouse on fire
downtown in our target area.

29:20.425 --> 29:22.211
Do you mind if I have
a cigarette?

29:22.511 --> 29:25.594
If you want to smoke,
you can smoke in the trunk.

29:31.061 --> 29:32.597
What's your name?

29:33.647 --> 29:34.807
John Doe.

29:36.900 --> 29:38.015
John Doe.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.653
Emily: Why are we turning?

29:51.957 --> 29:54.198
I don't think
this road goes through.

29:56.503 --> 29:59.210
Are you stopping?
Do you have to pee?

30:00.424 --> 30:01.880
I'd like to pee.

30:03.844 --> 30:06.551
- Sorry we missed out on conversation.
- Thank you.

30:06.847 --> 30:08.007
My hands are killing me.

30:08.307 --> 30:10.389
This is it.

30:10.684 --> 30:13.050
Ride's over. Get out. “What?

30:13.353 --> 30:15.389
Ride's over get out.

30:15.689 --> 30:17.350
You can't be serious.

30:17.649 --> 30:20.231
- Key's inside the bag.
- This is wilderness.

30:20.527 --> 30:22.297
- Scram.
- Is this where you dumped the chihuahua?

30:22.321 --> 30:24.201
How long did it last
before the coyotes ate him?

30:24.364 --> 30:26.696
Twenty minute hike to the highway.
Hit the road.

30:26.992 --> 30:29.233
It's... it's dark

30:29.536 --> 30:31.572
it's nighttime. Hit the road.

30:32.622 --> 30:33.907
Hit the road

30:34.875 --> 30:36.411
- bye.
- I can't go.

30:39.463 --> 30:41.579
Am I gonna have to drag you out?

30:50.974 --> 30:54.216
Easiest thing in the world for
a girl to do is get picked up.

30:54.519 --> 30:55.975
- No. I can't.
- Move it.

30:56.271 --> 30:58.262
I'm telling you I can't.
Don't throw kicks.

30:58.565 --> 31:00.772
- I can't move.
- Don't make sudden moves.

31:01.068 --> 31:02.729
Don't be afraid.

31:03.028 --> 31:04.609
Don't be afraid. No.

31:05.697 --> 31:08.279
No. Take me to the highway.

31:10.577 --> 31:13.284
Please! Don't leave me here.

31:13.580 --> 31:17.789
- Please!
- Don't be afraid. Stay right there.

31:18.085 --> 31:20.371
Look! A shooting star.
Make a wish!

31:29.346 --> 31:30.961
Wish you were here.

31:32.349 --> 31:35.136
No! I'm gonna die!

31:35.435 --> 31:38.802
No! No! You can't leave me!

31:39.106 --> 31:40.812
Get off the damn hood.

31:41.108 --> 31:43.144
- Get off!
- Are you gonna leave me?

31:50.534 --> 31:52.024
Look what you did.

31:52.327 --> 31:53.817
Look what you did.

31:55.580 --> 31:57.445
You scratched the paint.

32:00.794 --> 32:02.659
You're a real screwy kid.

32:06.425 --> 32:07.665
Get in the car.

32:10.053 --> 32:11.133
It's your lucky day.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.466
Gas, food and lodging:
Two miles.

32:13.765 --> 32:15.630
As far as you go. Hit the road.

32:15.934 --> 32:18.141
You can't just drive two miles?

32:18.437 --> 32:21.429
It's just business.
Come on. Road.

32:22.607 --> 32:26.600
Well, hope you enjoy my car.

32:41.626 --> 32:43.992
Man: The kid did
major shopping this month.

32:44.296 --> 32:48.915
Check this out: A Porsche
carrera, Mercedes 500 sl...

32:49.217 --> 32:50.707
And a Ferrari boxer

32:51.011 --> 32:53.377
I drove one once red

32:53.680 --> 32:56.217
red, huh? I never
drive a car like that

32:56.516 --> 33:00.179
you know why? Too much anger out there.
Too much envy.

33:00.479 --> 33:03.016
If I saw a guy like me
driving a car like that,

33:03.315 --> 33:05.727
it could get very ugly.

33:06.026 --> 33:08.893
Know what I mean, Gus?
Hey, I'm talking to you.

33:11.781 --> 33:15.399
- Gus: Which way am I going?
- Keep straight. Here.

33:15.702 --> 33:17.738
I'll tell you where to stop.

33:20.916 --> 33:24.579
Holy shit, man. Holy shit.

33:24.878 --> 33:26.743
- Look at that.
- Lot of cops.

33:27.047 --> 33:29.333
Keep moving.
Let's get out of here.

34:23.186 --> 34:25.141
Thanks a lot

34:25.438 --> 34:27.724
- hey, how you doin'?
- Good.

34:28.775 --> 34:31.061
$15.50 on number two

34:33.572 --> 34:36.359
and whatever you got.

34:36.658 --> 34:39.695
- Newsman: Filled with luxury cars.
- $2835.

34:39.995 --> 34:41.355
There was no one
on the premises...

34:41.621 --> 34:44.328
And the ownership of every car
but one is unclear

34:44.623 --> 34:47.286
that last car is a BMW
with the license plate...

34:47.585 --> 34:49.496
$28.35 total.

34:49.795 --> 34:51.076
Belonging
to the still missing...

34:51.255 --> 34:53.167
Kidnap victim, Emily t. Hope,

34:53.466 --> 34:56.378
heiress to multimillionaire,
Alexander hope,

34:56.678 --> 34:58.634
who was recently
under investigation...

34:58.930 --> 35:01.467
For security and exchange
commission violations.

35:01.766 --> 35:03.802
A police source speculates
that this building...

35:04.102 --> 35:06.343
Was the hideout
for the kidnappers.

35:23.455 --> 35:25.241
Do people live in this area?

35:25.540 --> 35:26.871
Is it mostly industrial?

35:27.167 --> 35:29.453
Not many. Artists' lofts,
that kind of thing.

35:31.171 --> 35:33.913
What about that building
that just burned?

35:34.215 --> 35:38.208
Yeah. Young guy.
I hope he's okay.

35:38.511 --> 35:39.546
Told me he was an artist,

35:39.846 --> 35:41.552
but I never saw
anything he painted.

35:41.848 --> 35:44.715
I know about him.
I came to see his stuff

35:45.018 --> 35:46.724
I'm a painter also.

35:47.020 --> 35:49.432
Really? Yeah

35:49.731 --> 35:54.395
was the warehouse just a
studio, or did he live there?

35:55.528 --> 35:56.859
I'm pretty sure he lived there.

35:57.155 --> 35:59.396
Comes here every other day
for breakfast

35:59.699 --> 36:02.441
- he's got another place up north.
- Is that right?

36:02.744 --> 36:05.110
Yeah. As a matter of fact,

36:05.413 --> 36:08.655
he sent me this postcard
last time he went.

36:10.627 --> 36:12.618
- That's you.
- Yeah, that's me!

36:12.921 --> 36:15.754
I ook at that smile

36:16.049 --> 36:18.085
I ook at that!

36:18.385 --> 36:20.501
Some things never change.

36:22.138 --> 36:23.138
That's great.

36:23.264 --> 36:27.473
Look at that. Great songs.

36:27.769 --> 36:29.725
They don't write 'em
like they used to.

36:30.021 --> 36:33.263
"Devil moon." That's great.
That's a classic.

36:33.566 --> 36:36.148
- Could I buy one?
- Oh, yeah!

36:36.444 --> 36:38.685
I got it in cassette, too.

36:44.035 --> 36:45.616
Here. Great

36:46.996 --> 36:48.031
thanks.

36:50.083 --> 36:51.448
How about one of each?

36:51.751 --> 36:53.457
- Oh, sure.
- Thanks.

36:55.004 --> 36:56.004
Okay.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.300
Emily! Emily!

37:10.603 --> 37:13.219
Can I have a word?
Your car burnt up.

37:16.359 --> 37:17.644
Emily! Emily!

37:19.571 --> 37:20.651
Emily!

37:22.532 --> 37:24.318
Emily! I'm dead meat.

37:29.038 --> 37:30.073
Emily!

37:31.541 --> 37:34.704
Listen, you don't
understand what's happening.

37:35.003 --> 37:38.336
My warehouse burned down.
They found your car.

37:38.631 --> 37:40.838
They got you missing in action.

37:41.134 --> 37:43.341
- S07?
- They're connecting all the wrong dots.

37:43.636 --> 37:45.843
They'll think I'm part
of your kidnapping prank.

37:46.139 --> 37:47.970
There are people after me.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.177
That's my point,
I'm not one of them!

37:50.477 --> 37:52.468
- S07?
- Could you stop walking?

37:52.771 --> 37:54.682
It's driving me crazy.

37:54.981 --> 37:57.347
Get off the street.

37:57.650 --> 38:00.687
Listen, I'm sorry
I stole your car.

38:01.654 --> 38:04.236
Believe me, I'm sorry.

38:04.532 --> 38:06.568
If 1 get a kidnapping rap...

38:06.868 --> 38:08.228
I ain't gonna
be able to handle it.

38:08.453 --> 38:10.364
That's not my problem.

38:10.663 --> 38:13.370
Can you call your family?
I'll drive you there.

38:13.666 --> 38:15.519
You call your family.
You tell them you're fine.

38:15.543 --> 38:19.331
I can get to my house,
get on with my life.

38:19.631 --> 38:22.247
You asking me to do you a favor?

38:22.550 --> 38:25.883
- Yeah, I'm asking you.
- Why should 1?

38:26.179 --> 38:29.922
I've been nice to you.
You've been nice?

38:30.225 --> 38:32.386
Yeah, under the circumstances,
I have.

38:32.685 --> 38:34.676
I don't know.
It's been a rough day.

38:34.979 --> 38:37.186
- You stole my car.
- I said I was sorry.

38:37.482 --> 38:39.188
You had me handcuffed
in your car.

38:39.484 --> 38:41.816
You almost left me
in the wilderness.

38:43.363 --> 38:45.524
I got a twinkie in the car.

38:47.158 --> 38:49.194
It's all yours if you want it.

38:51.329 --> 38:53.035
Make this call for me.

38:57.293 --> 38:59.124
I'm asking you
in a very nice way.

38:59.420 --> 39:01.877
Please make this call.
That's all

39:02.173 --> 39:06.166
it's not like asking you
to turn water into wine.

39:10.890 --> 39:11.890
Hmm?

39:19.524 --> 39:23.984
Js you've got your ball
you've got your chain

39:24.279 --> 39:28.898
js tied fo me tight
tying me up again

39:29.200 --> 39:33.569
js who's got the claws
in you my friend?

39:45.216 --> 39:46.706
Come on. Come on.

39:50.430 --> 39:52.796
So, what kind of car
was my kidnapper driving?

39:53.099 --> 39:55.761
Your kidnappers got away in
a white cutlass supreme.

39:56.060 --> 39:58.142
- White cutlass supreme.
- Right.

39:58.438 --> 40:00.303
I don't have any money.

40:01.774 --> 40:03.355
All right. 2-0-6 what?

40:03.651 --> 40:07.109
206-555-0166

40:13.119 --> 40:16.611
I got a collect call
from Emily t. Hope.

40:16.915 --> 40:18.655
Man: Hope residence.

40:18.958 --> 40:21.290
Operator: Collect call from Emily t.
Hope. Will you accept?

40:21.586 --> 40:22.996
Man: Miss Emily. Yes, of course.

40:23.296 --> 40:27.630
- Operator: Go ahead.
- Jon, is my father there?

40:27.926 --> 40:31.043
Emily, where are you?

40:31.346 --> 40:34.964
- What happened?
- Oh, hi, dad. I'm okay.

40:35.266 --> 40:39.305
But, daddy, he made me
touch his penis.

40:43.983 --> 40:45.314
Touch what?

40:45.610 --> 40:46.610
Oops.

40:52.116 --> 40:54.778
I didn't really
want to call him, you know.

40:59.082 --> 41:01.573
- Get away from my car.
- I gotta get my bag.

41:01.876 --> 41:03.366
Get away.

41:03.670 --> 41:05.661
Get away. Get away from the car.

41:15.807 --> 41:18.423
I wouldn't want to be
handcuffed next to me.

41:18.726 --> 41:21.638
Now take those off
and get on out of here.

41:24.607 --> 41:26.222
Where's the key?

41:35.368 --> 41:38.360
Give me that key. Spit it out.

41:38.663 --> 41:40.073
You made me swallow it

41:40.373 --> 41:43.706
give me that key.

41:44.002 --> 41:45.833
Open up.

41:57.223 --> 42:01.387
Open up. - It's not in there.

42:01.686 --> 42:03.426
It's gone.

42:03.730 --> 42:04.936
You know what you are?

42:05.231 --> 42:06.767
Something from under a rock.

42:18.494 --> 42:19.950
Fmii yy: Watch the road

42:22.415 --> 42:25.907
I don't know what you're looking for.
I swallowed the key.

42:33.676 --> 42:35.462
I hate this brush.

42:43.728 --> 42:47.471
You're not gonna
find it in there.

42:47.774 --> 42:50.311
I'm the only one who can
straighten things out for you.

42:50.610 --> 42:52.601
- So relax.
- Relax.

42:52.904 --> 42:56.943
Your one phone call added
30 years to my prison term.

42:57.241 --> 43:02.031
Turned me into a child
molester, kidnapper, rapist.

43:02.330 --> 43:04.116
You know what I'm gonna do?

43:04.415 --> 43:06.781
I'm gonna drive
to the police station...

43:07.085 --> 43:10.327
And I'm gonna turn myself in
so they can lock me up,

43:10.630 --> 43:13.497
'cause I'd rather be there
than sitting here with you.

43:31.526 --> 43:33.687
Vincent's warehouse burns down
and kistler's on a date.

43:33.986 --> 43:36.102
Eating a plate
of Linguini puttanesca.

43:37.240 --> 43:39.196
You want to do this?

43:39.492 --> 43:41.198
No I ain't dressed

43:41.494 --> 43:43.951
yeah I'll be back.

43:50.920 --> 43:52.160
Hey!

43:52.463 --> 43:55.580
- Hi, I'm stick.
- I'm Monique.

43:55.883 --> 43:58.044
Honey, excuse us.
Powder your nose.

43:59.137 --> 44:00.627
Greg: It's okay.

44:01.973 --> 44:04.214
Stickster, sit down. Yeah

44:04.517 --> 44:08.055
funny guy. The place
is very eclectic.

44:08.354 --> 44:10.845
- What?
- Don't you know that word?

44:11.149 --> 44:13.686
I'm gonna give you
another one: "Catastrophic."

44:13.985 --> 44:15.785
That's more relevant
to tonight's proceedings.

44:15.903 --> 44:19.066
- Woman: Hi, Greg.
- Pay attention! Birdbrain, listen.

44:19.365 --> 44:21.902
- What are you talking about?
- Did you see Vincent?

44:22.201 --> 44:24.482
- Did you give him the money?
- Yes. I gave him the money.

44:24.662 --> 44:27.404
Before or after
the place got torched?

44:29.167 --> 44:31.158
- What?
- That's right.

44:32.044 --> 44:33.625
Jesus Christ!

44:33.921 --> 44:35.377
Made the 10:00 news.

44:35.673 --> 44:37.413
How am I gonna tell mr dokas?

44:37.717 --> 44:40.424
You realize one of those cars
was for his niece's 21st?

44:40.720 --> 44:43.962
Imagine being 21
and not getting a Ferrari.

44:44.265 --> 44:47.257
Pretty shitty, right? Gosh!

44:47.560 --> 44:52.224
- What?
- Vincent was saying about going to Brazil.

44:52.523 --> 44:55.265
- Brazil?
- I1t's nothing.

44:55.568 --> 44:57.058
Let me get this straight.

44:57.361 --> 44:59.361
Vincent's got the money
and he's going to Brazil...

44:59.530 --> 45:02.272
And the only word
you can think is "gosh"?

45:02.575 --> 45:04.531
What sort of word is "gosh"?

45:08.706 --> 45:11.413
That's it? Oh! Monique is back.

45:12.501 --> 45:14.366
Sorry about the intrusion.

45:16.339 --> 45:17.954
Gosh!

45:18.257 --> 45:21.090
Keep saying "gosh."
See how far that gets you.

45:22.762 --> 45:26.630
You really look good.

45:26.933 --> 45:30.551
Emily: I don't usually like guys
who drive this kind of car.

45:32.396 --> 45:34.387
What is it, an Aston Martin?

45:41.405 --> 45:44.363
You had a phone?
Is that your phone?

45:44.659 --> 45:48.151
Wait. You got a phone? Yes.

45:48.454 --> 45:51.787
No one has this number.
“Answer it.

45:52.083 --> 45:55.667
- Probably a wrong number.
- Hello.

45:55.962 --> 45:59.375
Emily, what's going to happen
when you're really in trouble?

45:59.674 --> 46:02.006
When you cry “help”
and no one listens.

46:02.301 --> 46:04.007
Because that's Emily
playing games?

46:04.303 --> 46:06.339
This isn't a game. It's got
nothing to do with you.

46:06.639 --> 46:08.675
Maybe I could have
3 word with Vincent?

46:10.893 --> 46:12.008
Vincent?

46:13.437 --> 46:14.472
Who's Vincent?

46:14.772 --> 46:17.138
Who's letting you
use the telephone?

46:17.441 --> 46:18.806
I-I'm alone

46:19.110 --> 46:21.647
ray, stay out of this.

46:24.615 --> 46:26.025
I tell ya.

46:27.576 --> 46:29.737
Vincent, John Doe,
whoever you are,

46:30.037 --> 46:32.198
drop me off at the next motel.

47:02.695 --> 47:05.357
All right.
You're all checked in.

47:10.786 --> 47:12.742
Let me ask you a question.

47:14.665 --> 47:16.405
Do you have the key?

47:18.002 --> 47:19.287
Do you?

47:19.587 --> 47:22.545
You're gonna hurt
your precious automobile.

47:22.840 --> 47:24.580
I don't give a damn.

47:28.137 --> 47:29.923
It's always in the boot.

47:32.975 --> 47:34.761
Sorry about that.

47:37.688 --> 47:40.179
Thank you. Here.

47:43.319 --> 47:46.106
It's been real. Well, you know my name.
You know my face.

47:46.405 --> 47:48.896
You know my car. That's real.

47:51.577 --> 47:55.115
It'll be interesting to see
what you do with it. Here.

47:55.414 --> 47:57.200
How old are you?

47:58.709 --> 47:59.949
Twelve

48:06.008 --> 48:08.465
All right. If you say so.

48:11.597 --> 48:14.589
Js she shatters me in the mirror

48:16.727 --> 48:20.470

the lights

48:21.941 --> 48:25.399

48:35.788 --> 48:38.495

48:40.876 --> 48:43.663
Js it's all mixed up

50:07.796 --> 50:10.253
js it's all mixed up

50:12.676 --> 50:15.292
js it's all mixed up

50:17.556 --> 50:19.436
Greg: This is actually
a very little known fact,

50:19.725 --> 50:24.094
but they base the colors of
the bmws on women's mascara.

50:24.396 --> 50:26.728
You look like a mascara wearer to me.

50:27.024 --> 50:28.464
Phone call for you, Greg.
I ine four.

50:28.567 --> 50:29.932
Holly, can you take a message?

50:30.236 --> 50:31.556
It's Vincent.
He says it's urgent.

50:40.329 --> 50:44.413
Vincent. Where the hell are you?
Don't say you're at the airport.

50:44.708 --> 50:48.951
What do you mean? I'm up at the cabin.
Did you get my message?

50:49.255 --> 50:53.248
- Just tell me what happened.
- We lost it all, man.

50:53.551 --> 50:55.087
The warehouse burned down

50:55.386 --> 51:00.130
I know the warehouse burned down. I also
know two guys who are really unhappy.

51:00.432 --> 51:04.016
It was arson, all right?
You gotta warn dokas.

51:04.311 --> 51:07.428
Dokas just wants his money back.
Do you have the money?

51:07.731 --> 51:10.268
Yeah, we're lucky.
I have it right here with me.

51:11.235 --> 51:13.271
Be with you in a minute.

51:13.571 --> 51:15.527
Just get in the car
and bring it down here.

51:15.823 --> 51:19.532
I don't think I should be
driving anywhere right now.

51:19.827 --> 51:22.443
I've been driving all night.

51:22.746 --> 51:25.783
Let me get a few hours of sleep,
and I'll get you the money.

51:26.083 --> 51:31.123
Okay. I'll meet you at the
knotty pines bar at 3:00.

51:31.422 --> 51:35.961
And don't let me down. This could
get really ugly for both of us.

51:36.260 --> 51:38.751
- You got it.
- Gosh_

51:43.475 --> 51:45.136
Boy: Yeah, that's her.

51:45.436 --> 51:49.520
This guy she was with, did she seem
intimidated by him? Seem scared?

51:50.899 --> 51:52.810
No, no. I don't think so.

51:53.110 --> 51:55.021
He's been in here
a couple of times.

51:55.321 --> 51:58.028
Guy's got a real cool car.

51:58.324 --> 52:01.532
That, and the first time he was
here, he bought a bottle of Jack d.

52:02.745 --> 52:04.360
Well, w-was he alone?

52:04.663 --> 52:08.030
Yeah. But he came back
later with the girl.

52:08.334 --> 52:11.371
She used the phone outside.

52:11.670 --> 52:14.377
Did you hear what she said? Nah

52:14.673 --> 52:18.962
but, uh, I did see
them kissing in the car later on.

52:20.179 --> 52:21.339
Kissing.

52:23.307 --> 52:25.013
Yeah thanks.

52:25.309 --> 52:26.469
No problem.

52:46.121 --> 52:47.156
Psst

52:49.124 --> 52:51.285
hi.

52:51.585 --> 52:54.622
It's cool, man. It was arson.

52:54.922 --> 52:57.959
All right? As far as I'm concerned,
it could've been Indians.

52:58.258 --> 53:00.590
Looks to me like you're
goin' someplace, Vincent.

53:00.886 --> 53:04.754
Before this goes any further, let's give
Mr. dokas a call so I can talk to him...

53:05.057 --> 53:08.265
And tell him
exactly what happened.

53:08.560 --> 53:10.516
Do I look like I work
for somebody called dokas?

53:15.025 --> 53:16.936
I'm uncle ray.

53:17.236 --> 53:19.773
Is that supposed to
mean anything to me?

53:23.075 --> 53:24.690
Emily's uncle ray.

53:33.001 --> 53:36.243
Oh, Jesus Christ in heaven.
That's funny.

53:36.547 --> 53:38.458
I am no kidnapper.

53:40.050 --> 53:42.166
How did you find me?

53:42.469 --> 53:44.755
A lady I know
gave me a postmark.

53:45.055 --> 53:48.263
I got the postmark.
I got the town.

53:48.559 --> 53:50.925
Old boy in the store
told me the rest.

53:53.605 --> 53:55.971
I bought this coat there.
You like it?

53:59.361 --> 54:01.943
Emily tends to be impetuous.
Strong girl.

54:02.239 --> 54:06.278
She does things without thinking. I
guess it's characteristic of the young.

54:06.577 --> 54:10.195
I didn't do what she said
I did on the phone.

54:10.497 --> 54:13.910
I never touched her.
She never touched me.

54:15.419 --> 54:17.139
Maybe it's 'cause of
my military background,

54:17.421 --> 54:21.334
or maybe 'cause my dad's idea of
discipline bordered on scary,

54:21.633 --> 54:25.000
but I've always approached
duty with blind obedience.

54:25.304 --> 54:27.670
I deliver. Yeah.

54:27.973 --> 54:32.512
I don't confuse a particular task with the
big picture. You understand what I'm sayin'?

54:33.437 --> 54:35.143
Gimme a break.

54:35.439 --> 54:37.680
I must find Emily.
You must take me to her.

54:37.983 --> 54:41.191
Oh. Well, she's
at the red cloud motel.

54:41.487 --> 54:43.398
Good. Let's go.

54:43.697 --> 54:46.530
You can find it yourself.

54:46.825 --> 54:49.567
- Mister, put that back down.
- That's insurance.

54:49.870 --> 54:52.202
No, no. Come on, come on.
Put the bag down.

54:52.498 --> 54:55.865
Put your shoes on. Take a coat.
Freeze your ass off out there.

54:57.961 --> 54:59.201
Come on.

55:13.310 --> 55:14.641
You okay, miss?

55:16.188 --> 55:19.055
Night clerk said
your boyfriend left.

55:20.526 --> 55:24.064
Checkout time is noontime.

55:25.989 --> 55:28.355
Noontime.

55:44.967 --> 55:47.083
FBI agent's voice:
Give me some room.

55:47.386 --> 55:49.172
Please, sir. Step back.

55:52.641 --> 55:55.098
Stay back, folks. We'll
let you know in a minute.

55:57.354 --> 55:59.640
Do not touch the vehicle

55:59.940 --> 56:02.602
Alexander:
Thank god, you're safe.

56:02.901 --> 56:04.607
Mr. hope, how much
was the ransom?

56:04.903 --> 56:08.270
What does it matter?
This girl is my life.

56:12.327 --> 56:14.909
Waitress:
You want some more coffee?

56:15.205 --> 56:16.365
Hello?

56:18.417 --> 56:20.032
Are you okay?

56:21.503 --> 56:23.118
Thanks.

56:23.422 --> 56:26.630
You sure don't look like this is
the happiest day of your life.

56:26.925 --> 56:29.132
I haven't really
had one of those.

56:30.220 --> 56:32.336
It's men, isn't it?

56:32.639 --> 56:37.258
It's always men. They make you
promises they never intend to keep.

56:37.561 --> 56:41.429
Say they're gonna buy you a house,
and they don't bother doin' that.

56:41.732 --> 56:43.814
- Can't trust 'em.
- Thank you.

56:51.825 --> 56:54.487
She's not bad.
I bought the cd as well.

56:54.786 --> 56:58.119
I might make you a gift of it
if things work out between us.

57:01.376 --> 57:03.913
That's a lot of money
back there, Vincent.

57:05.714 --> 57:08.456
I earned it, and without a gun.

57:08.759 --> 57:10.624
You stole cars, Vincent.
You stole a lot,

57:10.928 --> 57:13.715
judging by that setup
in that warehouse.

57:14.014 --> 57:18.132
- Beats the minimum wage. What do you do?
- What'd Emily say I do?

57:18.435 --> 57:23.975
Not much,
but it don't look good.

57:24.274 --> 57:26.981
How come? Did I hurt you?

57:27.277 --> 57:29.359
Did I shoot you in the groin?

57:33.283 --> 57:34.773
Are those options?

58:04.648 --> 58:06.388
Is that seat taken?

58:10.946 --> 58:12.732
Coffee, please.

58:20.831 --> 58:23.288
- Miss me?
- I guess.

58:23.583 --> 58:27.826
Fat lady don't sing, what am I
supposed to do? Right, bodyguard?

58:32.384 --> 58:35.171
Look at this place.
This is really...

58:36.513 --> 58:38.595
A slice of americana.

58:38.890 --> 58:42.508
Yeah. Rockwell should've painted it.
I'm not going back with you.

58:43.562 --> 58:46.850
Okay. But, uh, let's talk.

58:48.483 --> 58:50.269
Nothing to talk about.

58:50.569 --> 58:54.153
Say, this is family business.
I got business of my own...

58:54.448 --> 58:57.690
Vincenzo, por favor.
Why don't you sit over there?

58:59.494 --> 59:01.610
Did I lay a finger on you? Hmm?

59:01.913 --> 59:05.246
- Did I try anything?
- No. He didn't do any of those things.

59:05.542 --> 59:08.784
No. Thank you. Who paid for
that motel room last night?

59:09.087 --> 59:11.499
Right. I did. I did.

59:11.798 --> 59:13.860
Vincent, you're giving me a headache.
Will you sit over there?

59:13.884 --> 59:16.466
Well, I need some
peace of mind here.

59:20.682 --> 59:21.797
Right.

59:26.563 --> 59:29.270
You look good. Pale, but good.

59:31.735 --> 59:34.317
How come you're pale? I thought
you lived in Costa Rica.

59:35.906 --> 59:40.445
I stay in the house a lot.

59:40.744 --> 59:44.453
Ray, if you're here because you're worried
about me, I appreciate your concern.

59:44.748 --> 59:47.205
But I'm okay.

59:47.501 --> 59:50.229
If you're here because my father ordered
you to come down here and take me home,

59:50.253 --> 59:53.620
you can run back to your
master, I'm not going.

59:53.924 --> 59:55.960
Emily.

59:56.259 --> 59:57.965
Could we go someplace else?

59:58.261 --> 01:00:01.003
Come on, ray. Don't you
think it's strange...

01:00:01.306 --> 01:00:04.139
My father isn't sitting across
from me at this table?

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:08.393
Yes, I think it's strange. But
strange and normal are not my job.

01:00:08.688 --> 01:00:11.680
This is not about mischief.
It's not about tattoos.

01:00:11.983 --> 01:00:14.144
And burnin' down
the school library.

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:18.153
Do you know how many cops, FBI agents,
are deployed lookin' for your ass?

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:21.190
Yeah. Daddy's little
lawyers will get rich.

01:00:21.493 --> 01:00:24.155
They're gonna earn it this time.

01:00:28.166 --> 01:00:30.498
You're facin' felony charges.

01:00:30.794 --> 01:00:33.752
Several: Attempted grand theft,

01:00:34.047 --> 01:00:37.210
theft by deceit,
conspiracy, extortion.

01:00:37.509 --> 01:00:41.468
What are you talking about?
“Tell me.

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:50.560
I don't have my wallet.

01:00:50.856 --> 01:00:53.723
- There's the check for the coffee.
- Vincent, not now.

01:00:54.025 --> 01:00:58.439
Look, if you give me the car keys, I'll get
the bag myself and bring you back the keys.

01:00:58.738 --> 01:01:01.354
Then I'll be on my way.
Gone. History. Road.

01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:06.618
Yes. That's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna
give my car keys to a car thief.

01:01:06.913 --> 01:01:10.747
I've been a good sport
so far, wouldn't you say?

01:01:11.042 --> 01:01:14.500
Hmm? Now, how much longer
do you want me to wait?

01:01:15.797 --> 01:01:17.537
Go order yourself some waffles

01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:19.923
two minutes. Just two minutes.

01:01:20.218 --> 01:01:23.460
Two minutes. I mean,
I'm tired of tossing salad,

01:01:23.763 --> 01:01:25.719
if you know what I mean.

01:01:31.813 --> 01:01:33.769
There goes my bargaining chip.

01:01:34.065 --> 01:01:36.272
- What do you mean?
- Gonna give him to the police.

01:01:36.568 --> 01:01:39.776
He's not alone. He works for people.
He could name names...

01:01:40.071 --> 01:01:42.027
No. No, you're not.

01:01:43.825 --> 01:01:45.986
He's a thief.

01:01:46.286 --> 01:01:49.619
- He's an innocent thief.
- What are you saying?

01:01:49.915 --> 01:01:52.952
You've formed some attachment
to him in 24 hours?

01:01:58.924 --> 01:02:02.416
I'm trying
to keep you out of jail,

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:06.257
away from all them sociopathic
gang-bangin' lesbians from hell

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:07.762
that mouth of yours,

01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:10.453
you're not gonna have any trouble
keepin' your dance card filled,

01:02:10.477 --> 01:02:12.263
you understand what I'm sayin'?

01:02:13.605 --> 01:02:16.938
- Mmm-hmm.
- Let me take you home.

01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:20.817
I'm not asking!

01:02:21.112 --> 01:02:23.728
Let's go! What's wrong with you?

01:02:25.867 --> 01:02:28.574
I'm takin' you home! Come on.

01:02:36.419 --> 01:02:38.831
I ain't goin' with you,
and you can't make me!

01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:41.609
I never should've married you,
Raymond Perkins. - That's a good one.

01:02:41.633 --> 01:02:43.339
My papa made me.
I was too young to know.

01:02:43.635 --> 01:02:45.466
- He beat me!
- Just get me my bag...

01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:48.523
Let's go! He's tryin' to keep me
from my baby! - What are you doin'?

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:51.803
Vincent, let's go! He's gonna kill you.
He's got a gun!

01:02:52.102 --> 01:02:54.182
- I like that. This is good.
Vincent: Give me my bag.

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:57.474
We gotta go!
Vincent, he's got a gun!

01:02:57.774 --> 01:02:59.981
Looks like the lady wants to leave.
“Whoa!

01:03:00.277 --> 01:03:03.485
- You're not gonna stop her.
Emily: Come on!

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:06.021
Let's go, Vincent.
I'm saving your ass.

01:03:06.324 --> 01:03:09.031
Save the trees, all right?

01:03:09.327 --> 01:03:12.694
- It's not your concern.
- I'm makin' it my concern.

01:03:21.798 --> 01:03:24.505
- That could've been you.
- That guy landed on his head.

01:03:26.344 --> 01:03:28.380
You're gonna be charged
with my kidnapping.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:31.171
Why would he do that? -'Cause
he's gotta clear my name.

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:33.661
Vincent: Well, then it's gonna
be your word against mine.

01:03:33.685 --> 01:03:36.222
- Don't be a jackass, Vincent!
- Get away!

01:03:36.521 --> 01:03:40.730
He's gonna kill you. I'll
just watch you die. - Peace!

01:03:42.986 --> 01:03:46.069
- Think he's gonna shoot?
- Yes, Vincent! Run!

01:04:17.312 --> 01:04:21.305
I'm the only person in the whole damn world
that can get that money back for you.

01:04:21.608 --> 01:04:24.475
- What?
- Quit being so stubborn.

01:04:24.778 --> 01:04:28.191
- All right?
- Right.

01:04:36.039 --> 01:04:38.030
Come on, come on. Get off.

01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:08.606
A guy just left the keys in his pickup.
I'm gonna take it.

01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:10.645
When I pull out,
you jump in. All right?

01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:16.575
Oh, shit.

01:05:29.217 --> 01:05:30.977
- Emily: We're gonna get pulled over.
- Nope.

01:05:31.261 --> 01:05:34.344
- Oh, yes, we are.
- No, we're not.

01:05:34.639 --> 01:05:37.130
Just act like you own the car.

01:05:37.434 --> 01:05:39.345
- How?
- Act like you know where you're going.

01:05:39.644 --> 01:05:42.681
- Where are we going?
- Knotty pines.

01:05:42.981 --> 01:05:45.313
What do you gotta go
to knotty pines for?

01:05:45.608 --> 01:05:48.350
So I can meet my man
and tell him,

01:05:48.653 --> 01:05:51.190
"hey, Greg. How you doin'?

01:05:51.489 --> 01:05:56.074
"It's so nice to see you. I
just got robbed of $200,000.

01:05:56.369 --> 01:05:59.827
"I enjoyed it. What? By her uncle.
Who? Her uncle"

01:06:00.123 --> 01:06:02.159
I mean, is this science
fiction or what?

01:06:02.459 --> 01:06:04.339
What do you
gotta tell him that for?

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:07.585
Because that money
don't belong to me.

01:06:07.881 --> 01:06:11.624
Okay. Then, you tell him that I'm
gonna get the money back for you.

01:06:12.594 --> 01:06:14.004
How are you gonna do that?

01:06:14.304 --> 01:06:17.671
Just stop whining. Trust me.
I'm gonna get you the money.

01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:21.512
Listen, if you
can do that for me,

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:25.395
I'm gonna thank you, I'm gonna
give you 100 million thank-yous.

01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:27.396
Well, you can start
thanking me right now.

01:06:27.692 --> 01:06:29.523
All right. Watch the road.
Thank you.

01:06:40.288 --> 01:06:43.200
You got a boyfriend? No.

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.286
Why not?

01:06:45.585 --> 01:06:48.873
You have... - I mean,
you're a pretty girl.

01:06:49.172 --> 01:06:50.912
You are watch the road

01:06:52.342 --> 01:06:54.378
I mean, you are.

01:06:54.677 --> 01:06:58.761
- You got a girlfriend?
- No. I gave that up.

01:06:59.057 --> 01:07:02.549
Why? - Because I always see
the potential of failure.

01:07:13.696 --> 01:07:17.564
- Hey, Emily.
- That's my man Greg from the warehouse.

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:24.241
- I did.
- She's sitting right here in front of me.

01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:28.204
I can see that. Sit down. We need
to talk. - Yes, we do need to talk.

01:07:29.254 --> 01:07:32.121
Hi. “Scotch on the rocks.

01:07:32.423 --> 01:07:34.630
- Do you have any ID?
- I'm gonna have the scotch.

01:07:34.926 --> 01:07:37.167
- She's gonna have a, uh, hot chocolate.
- Okay. You?

01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:39.430
Nothing, thanks. I really
don't feel like lounging

01:07:39.597 --> 01:07:41.804
over drinks here
in Heidi land, okay?

01:07:44.269 --> 01:07:47.477
- Just give me the bag.
- I don't have the bag.

01:07:47.772 --> 01:07:50.309
You don't have it? Where is it?

01:07:50.608 --> 01:07:53.771
I left it in her uncle's car.

01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:56.777
You left it in her uncle's car?
I don't believe this!

01:07:57.073 --> 01:08:01.157
- God! I don't believe this.
- Relax. It's not your problem.

01:08:01.452 --> 01:08:03.659
What the hell do you know
what my problem is?

01:08:03.955 --> 01:08:06.555
They think we set this whole thing
up together, for Christ's sake.

01:08:06.791 --> 01:08:08.452
Why would they think that?

01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:10.616
Gee, uh, maybe because
they're criminals?

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.660
And criminals think
the worst of people.

01:08:12.964 --> 01:08:15.956
They probably think we're in St. Bart's
windsurfing by now, for god's sake.

01:08:16.259 --> 01:08:20.502
St. Bart's? - If you were gonna
go there, you would've gone. Right?

01:08:20.805 --> 01:08:22.511
Is she always like this?

01:08:22.807 --> 01:08:25.640
She's hardheaded
and don't listen.

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:27.720
But her father's gonna
give us the money.

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:29.636
Like we was talkin'. Am I right?

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:32.520
Wait. Her father's gonna bring us
the money? You said her uncle.

01:08:32.817 --> 01:08:35.854
What difference does it make? My father's
gonna give the money to my uncle,

01:08:36.154 --> 01:08:38.554
and my uncle's gonna give the
money to me, do you understand?

01:08:38.823 --> 01:08:41.564
- Father's gonna bring...
- See?

01:08:41.868 --> 01:08:46.737
- I don't believe this.
- Easy. Collecting dust.

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:50.122
I can't believe you brought her here.
Thank you.

01:08:53.004 --> 01:08:56.121
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:02.390
Great. She's an alcoholic, too.
That's wonderful.

01:09:02.513 --> 01:09:04.299
That's great. Drink much?

01:09:07.518 --> 01:09:10.350
I'll be taking this, getting
some toothpaste. Get us a room.

01:09:10.647 --> 01:09:15.687
Yeah. Get some toothpaste. Yeah,
go freshen up. Get your room.

01:09:15.984 --> 01:09:18.067
Do you have any
idea what you're doing?

01:09:18.363 --> 01:09:20.319
She took your money.

01:09:21.366 --> 01:09:23.197
You guys make a great couple.

01:09:23.493 --> 01:09:26.234
Like Bonnie and Clyde.

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:35.872
One moment please, sir.

01:09:42.303 --> 01:09:46.546
Emily? How did you know
I was here?

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:48.714
Well, you can't do business
in the house,

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:50.883
not with all the police taps
on the phone.

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:55.305
So you had to be in your car, plane or boat,
or with one of your girlfriends. Right?

01:09:55.608 --> 01:09:58.566
You're a very smart girl,
Emily. You always were.

01:09:58.861 --> 01:10:01.477
Smart enough to know I have to
be out of the country tomorrow.

01:10:01.781 --> 01:10:06.821
Was the timing of this whole
fiasco connected with that?

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:10.328
Leave with your daughter in mortal peril?
What will people think?

01:10:10.623 --> 01:10:13.786
What in god's name
do you want from me?

01:10:14.085 --> 01:10:18.249
Uncle ray ripped off my friend I want
his money back. I want him unharmed.

01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:21.915
Then I'll come home and you can get
back to your precious business.

01:10:22.218 --> 01:10:24.584
Very well. You have my word.

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:27.469
- Meet me at the boat tomorrow.
- Thank you.

01:10:30.059 --> 01:10:31.595
When she does come back,

01:10:31.894 --> 01:10:34.431
there's gonna be a certain
amount of trouble to deal with.

01:10:36.524 --> 01:10:38.264
I'll look after the police.

01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:40.308
You take care of the rest.

01:10:41.612 --> 01:10:43.318
I'll take care of it.

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:56.286
What's your father do?

01:10:56.586 --> 01:10:57.792
Businessman

01:11:00.256 --> 01:11:01.996
what's your mother do?

01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:04.336
She died when I was three.

01:11:05.928 --> 01:11:08.260
- Sorry about that.
- That's all right.

01:11:10.224 --> 01:11:13.011
Do you remember her? No.

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:18.596
It's all right.

01:11:19.942 --> 01:11:22.308
Mind if I ask you a question?

01:11:22.612 --> 01:11:25.854
- What?
- What are you running away from?

01:11:29.744 --> 01:11:31.359
I'm not running away.

01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:36.201
I'm just trying
to get your money back.

01:11:37.752 --> 01:11:39.708
Oh, come on, come on.

01:11:43.341 --> 01:11:46.003
We both know you're
running away from something.

01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:49.009
I mean, why'd you put yourself
in the trunk?

01:11:50.973 --> 01:11:53.055
Oh, you're talking about that.

01:11:53.351 --> 01:11:55.558
Yeah. I want to know about that

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:01.726
I wanted to make my father feel.

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:04.725
Make him feel what?

01:12:05.029 --> 01:12:07.566
Something. Anything.

01:12:07.865 --> 01:12:13.201
How am I supposed to explain 18 years
of being unwanted and unwelcome?

01:12:13.496 --> 01:12:15.782
I've always been
a commodity to him.

01:12:16.082 --> 01:12:18.915
So you wanted to get even.

01:12:19.210 --> 01:12:20.495
I don't know, though.

01:12:21.796 --> 01:12:23.912
I always thought that...

01:12:24.215 --> 01:12:26.547
There was nothing and no one
in the whole world

01:12:26.843 --> 01:12:29.755
that could make me feel
like I knew who I was

01:12:30.054 --> 01:12:31.385
except for my father.

01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:33.592
Listen, you find yourself.

01:12:35.142 --> 01:12:37.474
I mean, you show yourself
who you are.

01:12:41.065 --> 01:12:43.056
You know?

01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:47.193
I mean, do you know the best
way to make a dream come true?

01:12:49.156 --> 01:12:51.738
Do you? It's to wake up.

01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:56.235
Then you'll find it.
You'll find...

01:12:56.539 --> 01:13:00.202
You'll find your ever livin' mother.
You'll find whatever you want.

01:13:02.378 --> 01:13:04.209
You know, it's true.

01:13:07.675 --> 01:13:10.758
Vincent: There any more little
bottles of gin? - We finished the gin.

01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:13.590
No, we finished
the little bottles of vodka

01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:16.427
I'm pretty sure on your side-
maybe under the bed there's...

01:13:16.726 --> 01:13:19.934
- One or two little bottles of gin.
- Why on my side?

01:13:21.022 --> 01:13:23.138
'Cause you hogged 'em all.

01:13:23.441 --> 01:13:26.308
Well, we got... this.

01:13:26.611 --> 01:13:29.102
"Cog-nac." sorry.

01:13:29.405 --> 01:13:31.862
I don't want any cognac.

01:13:32.158 --> 01:13:35.616
Vincent,
I got a question for you.

01:13:35.912 --> 01:13:38.995
- Shoot.
- What do you want?

01:13:39.290 --> 01:13:41.451
In the big picture,
what do you want?

01:13:41.751 --> 01:13:43.992
Vincent: What do I want?

01:13:44.295 --> 01:13:47.662
I want to open my own little chain
of karaoke bars down in Brazil.

01:13:47.965 --> 01:13:51.833
This friend of mine
goes there all the time,

01:13:52.136 --> 01:13:55.128
and he knows for a fact there's
no karaoke bars in Brazil.

01:13:55.431 --> 01:13:57.547
Can you believe that?

01:13:57.850 --> 01:14:00.808
You think you're the first person
who thought of this stupid idea?

01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:03.014
It ain't stupid.

01:14:03.314 --> 01:14:06.681
I could be an "intra-penure,”
you know.

01:14:06.984 --> 01:14:09.851
Wait a minute. You want to
make money, go on the run,

01:14:10.154 --> 01:14:12.315
just so you can make more money?

01:14:12.615 --> 01:14:15.857
Vincent, that's stupid. I've had that
my whole life, and it doesn't do shit.

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:18.025
It doesn't make you happy.

01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:21.946
It's not about the money, okay?

01:14:25.086 --> 01:14:28.328
And believe me,
I know what I do is wrong.

01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:29.666
I know

01:14:31.092 --> 01:14:32.548
right? I know.

01:14:33.928 --> 01:14:35.793
So I gotta go home,

01:14:36.931 --> 01:14:39.172
get your money.

01:14:39.475 --> 01:14:41.887
Then what do we do? “We?

01:14:45.982 --> 01:14:51.067
Well, if you want to come
after we get that money...

01:14:51.362 --> 01:14:54.729
No, I don't want to intrude.
I got my own stuff to do.

01:14:55.032 --> 01:14:59.071
No, really. If you want
to come, you can come.

01:14:59.370 --> 01:15:01.782
All right? I mean,
I'm telling you flat out.

01:15:02.081 --> 01:15:03.537
If you want to come,
you can come.

01:15:03.833 --> 01:15:08.327
And I'm not making a pass
at you. All right?

01:15:11.674 --> 01:15:13.005
Check it out.

01:15:15.011 --> 01:15:17.252
Those guys are fast.

01:15:17.555 --> 01:15:20.297
Shut it off, please!
It's disgusting.

01:15:20.599 --> 01:15:22.214
I don't know how to use
that thing, man.

01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:25.134
- Come on!
- All right. Here you go.

01:15:25.438 --> 01:15:28.020
Period. Happy? Yes.

01:15:29.233 --> 01:15:31.895
Listen, about that karaoke plan?

01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:34.685
Don't be telling anybody.
They'd take it.

01:15:37.324 --> 01:15:41.158
All right. I got rum, Tequila and rum.
Rum and Tequila.

01:15:41.454 --> 01:15:43.786
What would you like?

01:15:44.081 --> 01:15:46.697
You don't have to be drunk
to kiss me.

01:15:49.003 --> 01:15:50.539
Well, I'm not drunk.

01:15:51.547 --> 01:15:56.541
Js tell 'em I'm feelin' fine

01:15:57.887 --> 01:16:01.379
ID and I cried

01:16:02.266 --> 01:16:04.552
dp about it

01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:15.230
I stained my shirt.

01:16:17.198 --> 01:16:20.611
I was playing with
the hotel pen, and it broke.

01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:24.152
Well, there's postcards in the room.
You can write on 'em, you know.

01:16:40.429 --> 01:16:42.169
Do you like my tummy?

01:16:48.813 --> 01:16:50.269
Yeah, it's nice.

01:16:52.066 --> 01:16:53.772
Do you like my laugh?

01:16:55.653 --> 01:16:57.109
If you smile.

01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:03.903
I know you like my car.

01:17:04.203 --> 01:17:06.990
Well, me and your car, we...

01:17:07.289 --> 01:17:10.031
We never really
got that close, you know.

01:17:13.838 --> 01:17:15.669
I guess you like me?

01:17:27.351 --> 01:17:29.842
Come and have some breakfast

01:17:30.146 --> 01:17:34.515

01:17:34.817 --> 01:17:39.186

01:18:36.879 --> 01:18:37.959
Go.

01:18:49.183 --> 01:18:52.596
So, you spent the night
together, huh, Vincent?

01:18:52.895 --> 01:18:55.637
Listen, get her out of the trunk.
What do you need her for?

01:18:55.940 --> 01:18:58.477
Stick: What, are you kiddin' me?

01:18:58.776 --> 01:19:01.438
Hey, we know who her father is.
He's richer than Donald Trump.

01:19:01.737 --> 01:19:04.353
Didn't Greg tell you I was
gonna get you the money?

01:19:04.657 --> 01:19:07.444
Greg had a deadline,
and it passed. Right, Greg?

01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:09.449
I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry.

01:19:09.745 --> 01:19:11.656
Go to hell, man.

01:19:11.956 --> 01:19:14.197
Look, I didn't get this
from playin' racquetball.

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:18.038
- Shut up. You want some more?
- You don't have to point that at me.

01:19:18.337 --> 01:19:20.293
Shut up, both of youse!

01:19:20.589 --> 01:19:25.174
Stick, we're not stealing cars you're
stealing a human being. Are you on drugs?

01:19:25.469 --> 01:19:28.131
- No, you're on drugs!
- Get her out of the trunk!

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:30.842
Hey, everybody just calm down.
It's not gonna anything.

01:19:31.141 --> 01:19:33.006
- I'll calm down. Drive the car!
- Calm down.

01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:36.177
You know what? I don't need this
stress and anxiety. All right?

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:39.938
I don't need it for 200 grand. Screw
the 200 grand. We want a million.

01:19:41.277 --> 01:19:43.609
Okay, tough guy?
Yell all you want.

01:19:44.947 --> 01:19:46.778
Great. Terrific. Great.

01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:52.276
Huh? Keep drivin'.

01:20:02.589 --> 01:20:06.081
- Stick: We want a million, cash.
- All right, all right.

01:20:06.385 --> 01:20:08.171
Don't be late!

01:20:09.346 --> 01:20:11.257
Come on.

01:20:11.557 --> 01:20:14.515
This is serious, man.
I'm way, way out of my league.

01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:16.766
I'm not doin' time
for those guys!

01:20:17.062 --> 01:20:20.395
- I know, I know. Where you gonna go?
- I'm outta here. First plane.

01:20:20.691 --> 01:20:23.103
Before you do that, call Mr.
Dokas and tell him ..

01:20:23.402 --> 01:20:26.610
Those assholes took his money
and burnt his warehouse.

01:20:26.905 --> 01:20:28.896
I'm gonna go
and take care of this.

01:20:29.199 --> 01:20:32.316
You've known that girl
for two days, Vincent.

01:20:34.121 --> 01:20:36.237
I know. Make that phone call.

01:20:37.708 --> 01:20:38.823
Vincent

01:20:41.795 --> 01:20:42.795
Christ.

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:47.915
Emily hope?

01:21:07.529 --> 01:21:12.068
- I'm gonna go call dokas.
- All right. I'll get the luggage.

01:21:12.368 --> 01:21:14.780
Time to wake up,
my little Princess.

01:21:20.334 --> 01:21:22.746
Uh, give Mr. dokas
a message from us.

01:21:23.045 --> 01:21:26.333
Tell him we got the situation
under control.

01:21:26.632 --> 01:21:30.796
Stop. - He's gonna get all
the money and with interest.

01:21:31.845 --> 01:21:33.961
Yeah yeah

01:21:34.264 --> 01:21:37.035
we'll call you back when we make the
final arrangements. - Put me down!

01:21:37.059 --> 01:21:39.801
Okay? “Emily: Come on!

01:21:40.104 --> 01:21:42.470
- Come on! Put me down!
- Lock her upstairs in the office.

01:21:42.773 --> 01:21:44.388
- Gus: Stop that.
- Quit hitting me!

01:21:57.746 --> 01:22:01.330
We were expecting Emily. Well,
Emily's been kidnapped.

01:22:01.625 --> 01:22:05.789
Again. - For real, and
they want a million dollars.

01:22:06.088 --> 01:22:10.457
I have a distinct sense
of deja vu about this.

01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:13.000
She ain't cryin' wolf
this time, sir.

01:22:13.303 --> 01:22:16.716
I understand you've formed some sort
of relationship with my daughter.

01:22:17.015 --> 01:22:20.974
Well, with all due respect, I didn't
do what she said I did on the phone,

01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:22.976
if that's what you mean.

01:22:23.272 --> 01:22:26.639
Emily is trying to stop me
leaving the country.

01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:29.524
Sir, you're not listening.

01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:32.311
These kidnappers want
a million dollars

01:22:32.614 --> 01:22:36.152
plus the $200,000
your sidekick stole from me.

01:22:36.452 --> 01:22:40.195
Right, bodyguard? They're dangerous.
They're stupid and dangerous.

01:22:40.497 --> 01:22:43.534
And that's a bad combination.

01:22:43.834 --> 01:22:47.577
Perhaps she really is in trouble
this time, but you know something?

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:50.667
I've already paid a million
dollars for her once this week,

01:22:50.966 --> 01:22:54.379
and I have no intention
of going to the well again.

01:22:54.678 --> 01:22:57.260
It ain't about your money.
It ain't about my money.

01:22:57.556 --> 01:23:00.719
It's about your daughter.
Do you understand me?

01:23:01.018 --> 01:23:03.976
What is it? She ain't worth
a million dollars to you?

01:23:06.148 --> 01:23:10.642
Mr. Perkins will return the money
he took from you, not a cent more.

01:23:12.279 --> 01:23:15.567
Sir, you can turn your back
on me all you want,

01:23:15.866 --> 01:23:17.666
but you can't turn your back
on your daughter.

01:23:17.868 --> 01:23:19.608
Not now please

01:23:19.912 --> 01:23:23.245
you have your money.
Now get out of here.

01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:25.246
I've known this girl
for two days.

01:23:25.542 --> 01:23:28.579
Are you telling me I care
more about her than you?

01:23:28.879 --> 01:23:30.619
You son of a bitch.

01:23:30.923 --> 01:23:35.212
You should've sold her when she was born,
Mr. businessman. - Get your hands off me.

01:23:35.511 --> 01:23:37.877
Hey, this
is not the place for...

01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:40.045
Come on, come on.

01:23:40.349 --> 01:23:42.089
Scumbag.

01:23:48.857 --> 01:23:50.597
Come on.

01:23:50.901 --> 01:23:53.563
Get outta here, man.

01:23:57.741 --> 01:24:00.608
I have a plane to catch.

01:24:00.911 --> 01:24:04.244
We ought to make sure she's
okay first. Don't you think?

01:24:05.874 --> 01:24:07.785
You make sure she's okay.

01:24:26.061 --> 01:24:28.427
Put that thing in a paper cup,
and let's get outta here.

01:24:28.730 --> 01:24:30.470
I et's do it.

01:24:35.946 --> 01:24:38.983
Where is she? Show me it

01:24:39.283 --> 01:24:41.444
show me the money.

01:24:41.743 --> 01:24:44.325
Hey, hey!

01:24:44.621 --> 01:24:46.828
You're gonna get hurt
yourself, man.

01:24:47.124 --> 01:24:49.115
How do I know you got
a million bucks in there?

01:24:49.418 --> 01:24:51.538
Well, you're gonna have to
trust me, stick. Trust you?

01:24:51.795 --> 01:24:53.501
Yeah. I don't trust anybody.

01:24:53.797 --> 01:24:56.129
I gotta see for myself that
girl is all right. Walk on.

01:24:56.425 --> 01:24:59.487
Vincent, let me explain something. There's
a protocol with this kind of thing.

01:24:59.511 --> 01:25:03.254
- I get the money, you stay here.
- Hi. How you doin'?

01:25:04.057 --> 01:25:06.799
Good. How's it goin'?

01:25:07.102 --> 01:25:09.309
- Good.
- Who are you?

01:25:09.605 --> 01:25:12.312
I'm with Vincent.
He's my friend.

01:25:12.608 --> 01:25:15.520
- That's right. He's my bodyguard.
- Really?

01:25:15.819 --> 01:25:20.438
And that's a Colt python with
a silencer up your ass. Yeah?

01:25:22.576 --> 01:25:25.363
How does it feel, stick?

01:25:25.662 --> 01:25:29.154
Walk. You better tag along.

01:25:29.458 --> 01:25:31.494
Did I surprise you?
I like that a lot.

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:01.922
Mind if I ask you something?

01:27:02.217 --> 01:27:03.957
I don't know. Ask me.

01:27:05.762 --> 01:27:09.926
How could you work
for a jerk-off like that?

01:27:10.225 --> 01:27:12.181
You don't know what
you're talking about.

01:27:12.477 --> 01:27:15.014
We go back a long way.

01:27:15.313 --> 01:27:18.521
Well, with a father like that, you
should've looked out for her. You know?

01:27:18.817 --> 01:27:20.808
I did that too.

01:27:21.111 --> 01:27:24.478
It was my job to make sure she
could take care of herself.

01:27:30.412 --> 01:27:31.652
She's got some ass, huh?

01:27:31.955 --> 01:27:34.321
- Your mother's got some ass.
- What's your name?

01:27:35.584 --> 01:27:36.994
I'm stick.

01:27:37.294 --> 01:27:39.159
- Stick? Drive.
- Dickhead

01:27:40.922 --> 01:27:42.162
all right.

01:27:42.466 --> 01:27:44.957
I'm her uncle. Watch your mouth.

01:28:12.621 --> 01:28:15.078
Yo! Gus!

01:28:15.373 --> 01:28:17.329
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Heads up.

01:28:17.626 --> 01:28:21.210
Hey. Has he got a gun?
Oh. Look at that.

01:28:21.505 --> 01:28:23.086
Here's the money.
Where's the girl?

01:28:23.381 --> 01:28:25.872
- Give me the bag. Drop the animosity.
- Where's the girl?

01:28:26.176 --> 01:28:29.216
I was trying to explain to you before
this guy tried to give me a lead enema.

01:28:29.304 --> 01:28:32.717
There's a procedure, a protocol, to
this kind of thing. I check the money.

01:28:33.016 --> 01:28:37.055
- Understand?
- Look at that. That's a nice car.

01:28:37.354 --> 01:28:40.562
You know what? Stand still and shut up.
Stick: A million bucks.

01:28:40.857 --> 01:28:43.223
I waited a long time for this.

01:28:43.527 --> 01:28:47.270
What is this, man? What, are you kiddin'
here? There's no million dollars here.

01:28:47.572 --> 01:28:50.530
- That's what I owe, stick.
- That look like a million dollars to you?

01:28:50.826 --> 01:28:53.146
- Step up with the girl.
- Does anybody know the difference

01:28:53.411 --> 01:28:55.411
between a million dollars
and two hundred thousand?

01:28:55.539 --> 01:28:57.621
Anybody? That's what I owe.

01:28:57.916 --> 01:29:01.283
Vincent, I want to ask you something.
The 500 sl, that's a beauty,

01:29:01.586 --> 01:29:05.625
but do I need that kind
of horsepower?

01:29:05.924 --> 01:29:08.757
Who is this guy?
That's her uncle.

01:29:09.052 --> 01:29:11.338
Stick: What, are you kidding?
I trusted you, man.

01:29:13.890 --> 01:29:17.053
He took 800,000.
He ripped us off, man.

01:29:17.352 --> 01:29:20.139
- He freakin' ripped us off.
- Step up with the girl.

01:29:20.438 --> 01:29:23.145
Did you rip us off, man?

01:29:23.441 --> 01:29:27.104
- Don't do it, man. Don't do it.
- Did you rip us off?

01:29:27.404 --> 01:29:29.816
What? Don't be stupid.
Huh? Rip me off?

01:29:30.115 --> 01:29:33.073
What?

01:29:34.703 --> 01:29:38.787
What? - Could we get back to
doin' what we came here for?

01:29:39.082 --> 01:29:42.950
Oh, gee. Did we, uh, disturb your shopping
spree? This is the home shopping club?

01:29:43.253 --> 01:29:45.369
You like that car, Dracula?
Huh? You like it?

01:29:47.090 --> 01:29:50.298
Whoa! Now, that's not right.

01:29:50.594 --> 01:29:54.758
- What? What?
- I want to make sure the girl is okay.

01:29:55.056 --> 01:29:59.425
Stick: You don't get the picture.
You wanna dance, you pay the band.

01:29:59.728 --> 01:30:02.310
Unless you want half the girl.
Want half the girl?

01:30:02.606 --> 01:30:04.972
You think we're foolin'?
Why don't you shoot him, man?

01:30:05.275 --> 01:30:09.860
Stick: Take the shot, man. Gus:
Don't do it. Come on, come on.

01:30:10.155 --> 01:30:12.271
Go ahead. Put one in the uncle.

01:30:12.574 --> 01:30:15.611
Come on, come on.

01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:35.468
Looks to me like we're
about done here.

01:30:35.764 --> 01:30:37.504
Give me the gun. Hi.

01:30:43.313 --> 01:30:47.852
I know what I'm gonna do with you. The
question is, what am I gonna do with you?

01:30:48.151 --> 01:30:50.517
What are you doing?

01:30:50.820 --> 01:30:54.779
Your father's instructions were explicit.
He's not gonna let you embarrass him.

01:31:00.789 --> 01:31:02.120
Are you gonna kill me?

01:31:06.086 --> 01:31:08.327
No he's not

01:31:10.966 --> 01:31:12.627
what are you sayin'?

01:31:15.136 --> 01:31:16.467
This is for him?

01:31:24.479 --> 01:31:25.969
No, it's for me.

01:31:32.529 --> 01:31:35.692
Hope residence.

01:31:35.991 --> 01:31:38.073
It's Emily. Is my father there?

01:31:44.290 --> 01:31:48.203
What happened? - Emily called home.
We got a trace. Two-sixty terminal.

01:32:01.683 --> 01:32:05.676
Sims: I want containment on the
building, pairs on every corner.

01:32:27.333 --> 01:32:28.869
Chief: Stand down.

01:32:32.505 --> 01:32:35.042
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. I'm okay.

01:32:35.884 --> 01:32:38.296
She's had a hard time.

01:32:38.595 --> 01:32:40.881
The kidnappers
are tied up inside.

01:32:44.267 --> 01:32:45.723
Come on.

01:32:50.023 --> 01:32:53.641
I was gonna stick around, but
I don't think I have to now.

01:32:53.943 --> 01:32:56.434
Well, I can always
use my friend.

01:32:57.530 --> 01:33:00.317
I'm only a phone call away.

01:33:15.924 --> 01:33:18.631
Look, we have to think
damage control.

01:33:20.095 --> 01:33:22.677
My lawyers will be there
when you make your statement.

01:33:22.972 --> 01:33:25.076
That's really not necessary.
I'm gonna be telling them...

01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:26.886
How I started this whole thing.

01:33:27.185 --> 01:33:30.143
- Why would you want to do that?
- It's my mess.

01:33:30.438 --> 01:33:33.100
It's my responsibility
to sort things out.

01:33:42.408 --> 01:33:46.026
Well, it's good
to have you home.

01:33:46.329 --> 01:33:49.787
I won't be here when you get back.
I'm gonna be moving out.

01:33:51.334 --> 01:33:52.949
Emily. Yes.

01:33:54.754 --> 01:33:57.040
As distasteful
as it may be to you,

01:33:58.091 --> 01:33:59.956
you're still my daughter,

01:34:00.969 --> 01:34:02.960
and I'm still your father.

01:34:06.099 --> 01:34:07.214
I know

01:35:22.342 --> 01:35:23.457
Not bad

01:35:24.928 --> 01:35:27.135
how you doin'?

01:35:27.430 --> 01:35:29.136
I've seen better days.

01:35:35.188 --> 01:35:37.554
I'm hot. Sit down.

01:35:38.691 --> 01:35:40.727
I need to decompress.

01:35:42.111 --> 01:35:43.476
Red wine

01:35:46.241 --> 01:35:48.323
- is that for me?
- Present.

01:35:48.618 --> 01:35:50.654
1991. My favorite.

01:36:00.922 --> 01:36:02.753
You want some?

01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:06.131
How old are you?

01:36:10.807 --> 01:36:12.638
Old enough.

01:36:16.729 --> 01:36:20.392
Oh, yeah. What a view.

01:36:20.692 --> 01:36:23.855
I mean, that's a view.

01:36:30.994 --> 01:36:32.780
What makes this a view?

01:36:39.335 --> 01:36:40.335
You

01:36:51.431 --> 01:36:53.467
Come on, come on, come on.

01:36:59.272 --> 01:37:00.808
Come on, come on.
