- On "The Secret Life Of Amrican Teenager"...
- Somebody telld You?

00:04.764 --> 00:05.607
You Sleeped with amy,
And I Sleeped with ben.

00:05.702 --> 00:07.002
I didn't sleep with Amy.

00:07.036 --> 00:08.637
I haven't slept with Amy since band camp.

00:08.671 --> 00:10.138
I kissed her! I only kissed her!

00:10.173 --> 00:12.140
Ben had sex with Adrian.

00:12.175 --> 00:14.443
If a guy asks me if he can kiss me,
and I have to think about it,

00:14.477 --> 00:16.798
then the answer is gonna be...

00:16.832 --> 00:19.226
Besides, if Jack or Jesse
knew that we were thinking...

00:19.260 --> 00:21.824
about marriage or babies-
They'd break up with us.

00:21.858 --> 00:23.993
And I'm tired of living with your mistakes.

00:24.028 --> 00:26.159
Is anything really a mistake,

00:26.193 --> 00:28.293
or are mistakes just lessons?

00:28.328 --> 00:30.728
I was just wondering if you would
care to be my maid of honor.

00:30.763 --> 00:32.800
I'd be honored, Betty.

00:32.834 --> 00:34.241
I didn't wanna see you again.

00:34.275 --> 00:35.746
Because I had a condom?

00:35.780 --> 00:38.651
Because you lied.
Do you wanna talk to me about it?

00:38.686 --> 00:41.823
Do I wanna talk about a mistake
I made with sex to a hooker?

00:41.857 --> 00:45.064
I had sex with Adrian,
and now Ricky is gonna pummel me.

00:45.099 --> 00:47.133
You know what? I hope he does pummel me.

00:47.168 --> 00:48.669
You, Grace-- you haven't seen Ricky?

00:48.703 --> 00:50.303
Something wrong?

00:50.338 --> 00:52.606
He moved out of his apartment
without telling anyone.

00:52.640 --> 00:55.408
Remember when we first met,
and everything was fun?

00:55.442 --> 00:57.176
That was the best time of my life.

01:08.720 --> 01:09.720
Hey.

01:12.323 --> 01:14.292
Yeah, hey yourself.

01:14.327 --> 01:16.294
Have you seen my mother around?

01:16.329 --> 01:18.296
Not in years. You neither.

01:18.330 --> 01:19.965
So what you been up to, kid?

01:20.000 --> 01:22.135
I'm not a kid. Never was.
And what do you care?

01:22.170 --> 01:24.740
You sure you haven't seen her?
Out of the business.

01:24.774 --> 01:27.577
I doubt it. I'm telling you,
clean and sober.

01:27.611 --> 01:29.980
Is she with someone? I'll wait.

01:30.014 --> 01:33.116
Honestly, she's not here and hasn't
been here in a long, long time.

01:33.151 --> 01:35.852
Yeah, all right.

01:35.886 --> 01:38.588
When you see her, tell her I came by.

01:38.622 --> 01:40.957
I need to talk to her.

01:42.794 --> 01:44.161
Here.

01:44.195 --> 01:47.597
Honestly, I don't know where she is.

02:05.484 --> 02:07.151
What? He was here.

02:07.186 --> 02:09.954
What? Who was here? Your son, Ricky.

02:28.410 --> 02:29.711
Hey, Ashley.

02:29.745 --> 02:31.713
Oh, so you're finally picking up the phone.

02:31.747 --> 02:32.980
Where are you?

02:33.015 --> 02:35.550
I have some unfinished business
I have to take care of.

02:35.584 --> 02:38.019
Your mother? You told me about your mother.

02:38.053 --> 02:39.520
I didn't realize you were listening.

02:39.555 --> 02:41.522
Well, that's what happens
when you have conversations...

02:41.557 --> 02:43.524
in a kitchen instead of a bedroom.

02:43.559 --> 02:45.660
I was listening.

02:45.694 --> 02:47.862
Are you coming back? I don't think so.

02:47.896 --> 02:50.764
Well, you made a pretty
dramatic exit. I'm impressed.

02:50.799 --> 02:53.568
Don't be. I felt I had no other choice.

02:53.602 --> 02:56.571
Everyone's calling everyone.
Everyone's looking for you.

02:56.605 --> 02:59.942
Everyone's worried about you. I doubt it.

02:59.976 --> 03:01.944
I called my fosters this morning.

03:01.979 --> 03:04.214
I told them I'm okay.
I just didn't tell them where I am.

03:04.248 --> 03:05.882
Leo's got people looking for you.

03:05.916 --> 03:07.484
Why? I don't owe him any rent.

03:07.519 --> 03:09.219
You owe him a conversation, don't you think?

03:09.254 --> 03:12.590
Maybe. I don't know.
I don't wanna talk to anyone.

03:12.625 --> 03:15.894
All right. Well, once you
talk to your birth mother,

03:15.928 --> 03:18.531
maybe you will wanna talk to someone.

03:18.565 --> 03:20.700
And if you do wanna talk to someone--

03:20.734 --> 03:24.104
a friend-- call me, okay?

03:24.138 --> 03:26.406
We're friends? I thought we were. Yeah.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.208
How is he?

03:28.242 --> 03:29.744
<i>John? He's fine.</i>

03:29.778 --> 03:32.146
How are you? Not that good.

03:32.180 --> 03:34.915
Come back. Come on, Ricky.

03:34.950 --> 03:36.784
I can't. I'd look like an idiot now.

03:36.818 --> 03:39.087
No, you wouldn't. Just move back in,

03:39.121 --> 03:40.922
show up at school and
pretend it never happened.

03:40.956 --> 03:43.625
If only. If only my life never happened.

03:43.659 --> 03:47.329
Don't say that. I hate myself, Ashley.

03:47.363 --> 03:50.165
As well as a couple of other people.

03:50.200 --> 03:52.401
I really wanted to kill someone,
so I just left.

03:52.435 --> 03:56.105
Oh. Well, um,

03:56.139 --> 03:58.273
I guess leaving beats killing anyone.

03:58.308 --> 04:02.010
But now that you're feeling better,

04:02.045 --> 04:04.980
you could just come back whether
you see your mom or not.

04:05.014 --> 04:07.616
Who said I was feeling better?
I'm not feeling better.

04:07.651 --> 04:10.319
I wish I'd never gotten into
any relationship with Adrian,

04:10.353 --> 04:12.321
I wish I'd never made
friends with Ben and Leo,

04:12.356 --> 04:15.792
and more than anything else, I wish I'd
never met your sister and did what I did to
her.

04:15.827 --> 04:18.796
Really? 'Cause John's pretty special.

04:20.132 --> 04:21.766
<i>What's talking to your
mother gonna do?</i>

04:21.800 --> 04:23.435
Just come back.

04:23.469 --> 04:26.871
I don't really know,
but I'm gonna talk to her,

04:26.906 --> 04:29.674
then I'm just gonna get in my
car and drive and keep driving.

04:29.709 --> 04:31.810
Mmm. Drive safely.

04:31.844 --> 04:32.977
Thanks, Ashley.

04:33.012 --> 04:35.446
And don't forget, you can call me.

04:35.480 --> 04:37.114
I won't tell anyone.

04:37.148 --> 04:41.117
And you call me if anything
ever happens to John. All right?

04:41.152 --> 04:44.620
All right. Bye.

04:45.856 --> 04:48.324
Bye.

04:52.729 --> 04:55.131
<i>?T×³ Falling in love ?T×³...</i>

04:55.166 --> 04:58.402
<i>?T×³ Is such an easy thing
to do ?T×³...</i>

04:58.436 --> 05:01.138
<i>?T×³ Birds can do it We
can do it ?T×³...</i>

05:01.173 --> 05:03.508
<i>?T×³ Let's stop talking Let's
get to it ?T×³...</i>

05:03.542 --> 05:05.877
<i>?T×³ Let's fall in love ?T×³...</i>

05:11.919 --> 05:14.854
Hey, cha-cha. I'm off.
When I come back the day after tomorrow,

05:14.889 --> 05:16.857
we're gonna have a little wedding, so...

05:16.891 --> 05:18.358
Yeah.

05:18.393 --> 05:20.894
Look, you have to get some other witnesses.

05:20.928 --> 05:22.562
Ricky's parents backed out.

05:22.597 --> 05:24.865
They backed out? Without even meeting us?

05:24.899 --> 05:26.799
Yeah. They backed out.

05:26.834 --> 05:28.734
Oh, all right.

05:28.768 --> 05:30.736
Well, we'll just have to get new witnesses.

05:30.771 --> 05:33.139
They have a lot of witnesses
at these wedding chapels.

05:33.173 --> 05:34.707
Is Ricky coming? I doubt it.

05:34.741 --> 05:36.008
Because...

05:36.043 --> 05:37.977
He left.

05:38.011 --> 05:39.879
He left? What do you mean, he left?

05:39.913 --> 05:41.047
He took off.

05:41.081 --> 05:42.182
Do you know where he is?

05:42.216 --> 05:43.517
No. He hasn't called me.

05:43.551 --> 05:45.853
You don't know where he is or why he left?

05:45.887 --> 05:47.254
No. No one does.

05:47.288 --> 05:50.190
Did his parents back out,
or you're just assuming?

05:50.225 --> 05:51.359
Assuming.

05:51.393 --> 05:53.094
Adrian,

05:54.196 --> 05:56.196
your dad told me that Ricky kissed Amy.

05:56.231 --> 05:57.898
Yeah? So Ricky claims.

05:57.933 --> 05:59.934
He's not gonna tell Ruben
he did more than kiss Amy.

05:59.968 --> 06:02.202
What, you think he's lying?
That he and Amy did something more?

06:02.237 --> 06:04.538
I thought so, but...

06:04.572 --> 06:07.374
Look, I don't know. Who knows?
He's a liar, and so is she.

06:07.409 --> 06:11.011
Hmm. What did you do?

06:11.045 --> 06:13.013
I know you wouldn't just let that go.

06:13.047 --> 06:15.582
Even if you knew it was just a kiss,
you wouldn't just let that go.

06:15.616 --> 06:17.584
Of course I wouldn't,
so I fooled around with Ben.

06:17.618 --> 06:19.319
Fooled around, as in had sex with Ben?

06:19.353 --> 06:21.221
Ben Boykewich? Amy's boyfriend, Ben?

06:21.255 --> 06:24.925
They don't go out. They're not
boyfriend-girlfriend anymore.

06:24.959 --> 06:26.927
Oh, no. He's just friends with Ricky.

06:26.961 --> 06:29.163
You went to Ricky's friend
to get back at him? Adrian!

06:29.197 --> 06:31.432
Look, I wish I didn't, but I did,

06:31.466 --> 06:33.367
and now I just have to live with that.

06:33.401 --> 06:35.236
And, well, I can live with that.

06:35.270 --> 06:38.172
Adrian, come on.
You don't have to be so tough.

06:38.207 --> 06:40.174
I know that losing Ricky
would break your heart.

06:40.209 --> 06:43.277
And now that he's gone, you can't
possibly be so cavalier about all this.

06:43.312 --> 06:45.680
Please, I'm not heartbroken.

06:45.714 --> 06:47.815
I'm fine. Look, I--

06:47.850 --> 06:51.419
Okay, I was upset, but I'm fine.
Go. Have a good trip.

06:51.453 --> 06:53.888
Mmm. Thanks.

07:06.001 --> 07:08.369
Hey. What'd you find out?

07:08.403 --> 07:10.037
She slept with Ben.

07:10.071 --> 07:12.473
To get back at Ricky for kissing Amy.

07:12.507 --> 07:15.677
I talked to him for hours.
He kissed her. It wasn't anything else.

07:15.711 --> 07:18.012
I don't think it would've mattered
if it was a kiss or something else.

07:18.047 --> 07:21.649
I have to go. I'm sorry,
but I really have to go.

07:21.684 --> 07:24.018
And when I go, what are
you going to say to her?

07:24.052 --> 07:25.553
I was going to say--

07:25.588 --> 07:28.089
That you love her. Say that you love her.

07:28.123 --> 07:31.325
She knows that she did the wrong thing.
And no matter what she says,

07:31.360 --> 07:33.862
I think she feels bad about herself
and about doing the wrong thing.

07:33.896 --> 07:37.332
I did not do the wrong thing.
That's not what I said.

07:37.366 --> 07:39.368
I have to go.

07:39.402 --> 07:42.004
See you, Mrs. Enriquez.

07:43.206 --> 07:44.707
See you.

07:44.741 --> 07:47.710
Have a safe trip. Love you.

07:53.050 --> 07:56.019
It was wrong. Wait.

07:56.053 --> 07:58.222
I love you. You're my daughter.

07:58.256 --> 08:00.424
But it was wrong. Says who?

08:00.459 --> 08:02.360
Says you. Come on.

08:02.394 --> 08:04.395
All right, Adrian.

08:04.430 --> 08:06.397
What would make it wrong?

08:06.432 --> 08:09.534
When would having sex with Ben or any
other guy be wrong, in your opinion?

08:09.569 --> 08:11.469
If the sex wasn't fun.

08:11.504 --> 08:13.804
And believe me, that was not the case.

08:13.839 --> 08:15.273
He had a good time.

08:15.307 --> 08:17.041
He had a good time?

08:17.075 --> 08:19.042
So if the guy had a good time, it's okay,

08:19.077 --> 08:21.678
and there's nothing wrong with it,
and your feelings don't count?

08:21.712 --> 08:23.846
I had a good time. Really?

08:23.881 --> 08:26.549
You didn't just make yourself have sex
with Ben to get back at Amy and Ricky?

08:26.583 --> 08:28.651
I didn't have to make myself.

08:28.685 --> 08:30.720
I wanted to have sex with Ben.

08:30.754 --> 08:32.855
I like Ben. We're friends.

08:32.890 --> 08:34.657
And, you know, what's sex between friends?

08:34.692 --> 08:36.393
It's wrong. Yeah, well,

08:36.427 --> 08:37.995
what do you think?

08:38.029 --> 08:41.065
Is it wrong to just take off without
saying anything to your girlfriend?

08:41.099 --> 08:43.434
After your girlfriend has
sex with your best friend?

08:43.469 --> 08:45.904
Are you kidding me? What were you thinking?

08:45.939 --> 08:48.307
What could you possibly have hoped
to accomplish with this little tryst?

08:48.341 --> 08:51.009
I'll tell you not only
what I hoped to accomplish,

08:51.044 --> 08:53.278
but what I did accomplish.

08:53.312 --> 08:54.946
I evened the score.

08:54.980 --> 08:57.215
The score is even now.

08:57.250 --> 08:58.884
Even.

08:58.918 --> 09:00.919
Ricky was Amy's first,
and I was Ben's first.

09:00.953 --> 09:03.288
That's great. That's just great.

09:03.322 --> 09:05.390
Think about this, Adrian:

09:05.424 --> 09:08.526
Was it really to your
advantage to even the score?

09:08.561 --> 09:10.461
Maybe the score should've been left uneven.

09:10.495 --> 09:12.129
No. I don't wanna think about that.

09:12.164 --> 09:14.331
You should always think about that.

09:14.366 --> 09:17.634
Think about what you're doing and whether
it's to your advantage or anyone's
advantage,

09:17.668 --> 09:19.202
and if it's not, don't do it.

09:19.236 --> 09:22.004
I've told you this before. Yes, I know that.

09:22.039 --> 09:25.408
But, you know, it was to Ben's
advantage for us, too, you know.

09:25.442 --> 09:27.610
Not necessarily, Adrian.

09:27.644 --> 09:29.245
Are you kidding?

09:29.279 --> 09:30.947
He's been wanting to have sex all year.

09:30.981 --> 09:34.050
How do you go from crying that
you've lost Ricky to this, huh?

09:34.084 --> 09:37.253
How does that happen? This feels better,

09:37.288 --> 09:38.888
and it's easier.

09:38.923 --> 09:40.590
I have to get to school.

09:40.624 --> 09:44.294
Where's Ashley? We have to go.

09:44.328 --> 09:46.029
Why don't I drive you three today?

09:46.063 --> 09:48.665
Why would you drive us? No reason.

09:48.699 --> 09:51.602
You don't have a reason? No, not really.

09:51.636 --> 09:54.138
Hoping Ricky will be there? Ricky?

09:54.172 --> 09:56.607
At school. I'll let you know if he shows up.

09:56.641 --> 09:58.608
You don't have to drive me and
scout out the parking lot.

09:58.643 --> 10:00.311
I just don't want you to
go out looking for him.

10:00.345 --> 10:02.380
I never even thought about doing that.

10:02.414 --> 10:04.983
You mean, like, skipping school and
going out to look for him-- for Ricky?

10:05.017 --> 10:06.518
Yeah. I'm not gonna do that.

10:06.552 --> 10:08.854
I mean, I hope he's okay.
And I want him to come back...

10:08.888 --> 10:10.589
so he continues to be around for John.

10:10.623 --> 10:13.592
But, Dad, if Ricky's gone, he's gone.

10:13.626 --> 10:15.527
Just how it is. What?

10:15.562 --> 10:18.163
I wouldn't mind being a single parent.
At least not for a while.

10:18.198 --> 10:20.232
What are you talking about?
I wouldn't mind...

10:20.266 --> 10:22.435
having John to myself and not
having to share him with Ricky.

10:22.469 --> 10:25.071
I know it's best for a boy
to have his father around,

10:25.105 --> 10:27.006
and for John to have both of his parents.

10:27.040 --> 10:30.910
But if I'm to be completely
and totally honest,

10:30.944 --> 10:33.479
I would not mind not having
to deal with Ricky every day,

10:33.513 --> 10:36.649
and I wouldn't mind finding
a new dad for John.

10:36.683 --> 10:38.818
Somewhere down the line, years from now.

10:38.852 --> 10:40.820
A dad that I choose to be with,

10:40.854 --> 10:43.623
not a guy that I have to be with
because he's the biological father.

10:43.657 --> 10:45.157
Like Jimmy? Maybe.

10:45.192 --> 10:47.793
Oh, come on. It's not like
I'm the first mother...

10:47.828 --> 10:50.329
who wishes she didn't have to
deal with the kid's father.

10:50.364 --> 10:51.831
And it doesn't mean I don't appreciate...

10:51.865 --> 10:54.500
that Ricky has been a good
and responsible father.

10:54.534 --> 10:57.603
But it doesn't even mean that
I'm going to marry Jimmy.

10:57.637 --> 11:01.207
It's complicated.
And my life is very complicated.

11:01.241 --> 11:03.676
And I'm sick of complicated.

11:03.711 --> 11:05.911
I would like to un-complicate my life.

11:05.945 --> 11:07.913
I would like to start by
not driving her to school.

11:07.948 --> 11:10.082
So do me a favor.
Drive her to school, please.

11:17.989 --> 11:21.291
She's happy he's gone. She's happy
Ricky disappeared. You believe that?

11:21.326 --> 11:22.492
Yes, I do. Why?

11:22.527 --> 11:24.428
She's wanted Ricky to come to her rescue...

11:24.462 --> 11:27.163
ever since she got pregnant, but he didn't.

11:27.197 --> 11:30.800
He chose to be with Adrian. And now
that the guy who did come to her rescue,

11:30.834 --> 11:34.703
Ben, has also chosen to be with Adrian...

11:34.738 --> 11:38.207
Well, I think Amy would be happiest if
they all just disappeared. Let's go.

11:38.241 --> 11:41.010
Hold on. I wanna ask you something.

11:41.045 --> 11:43.379
You haven't talked to Ricky
since he left, have you? Me?

11:43.413 --> 11:45.047
Yeah, you. Why would he talk to me?

11:45.081 --> 11:47.616
I don't know. You tell me.
I don't know anything, honest.

11:47.651 --> 11:49.718
Okay. Just thought I'd ask. Let's go.

12:00.432 --> 12:03.367
Where you going? Where am I going?
I'm going to school.

12:03.401 --> 12:07.004
Mom's having breakfast with Jeff, so she
asked me to get a friend to give me a ride.

12:07.038 --> 12:10.374
What friend? You don't have a friend.

12:10.408 --> 12:13.845
Adrian is not your friend anymore.

12:13.879 --> 12:16.915
You're right. She's not.
But I still have friends.

12:16.950 --> 12:18.784
And, for your information, I'staying out...

12:18.819 --> 12:21.054
of the whole Amy-Ben-Ricky-Adrian disaster.

12:21.088 --> 12:22.889
And may I suggest you do the same thing?

12:22.924 --> 12:24.558
She's not your friend, Tom.

12:24.592 --> 12:27.127
I don't think any of them
are my friends, either.

12:27.162 --> 12:29.596
I mean, none of them took my
feelings into consideration...

12:29.630 --> 12:31.599
when everything was happening, did they?

12:31.633 --> 12:33.901
Adrian didn't care that
I was interested in Ben.

12:33.936 --> 12:35.870
Ben didn't care that I
was interested in him.

12:35.905 --> 12:37.873
And the fact they did
what they did proves...

12:37.907 --> 12:40.076
that Ben is still in love with Amy,

12:40.110 --> 12:42.144
and Adrian's still in love with Ricky,

12:42.179 --> 12:44.079
and Ricky's not in love with anyone,

12:44.114 --> 12:46.415
and so on and so forth, ad nauseum.

12:46.449 --> 12:49.218
Oh, I got it.

12:49.252 --> 12:51.320
You're upset...

12:51.355 --> 12:54.757
because you wanted part of the action.

12:54.791 --> 12:56.025
I am not.

12:56.059 --> 12:57.226
You got left out.

12:57.260 --> 13:00.162
I didn't want to be involved with any of it.

13:00.197 --> 13:02.899
As it turns out, those are just
people I don't wanna hang out with.

13:02.933 --> 13:06.035
So who do you hang out with,
Madison and Jack?

13:06.070 --> 13:08.138
Madison and Jack split up.

13:08.172 --> 13:10.573
But Madison's not the type of
person I wanna hang out with either.

13:10.608 --> 13:11.941
I see where this going.

13:11.976 --> 13:13.777
Jack is picking me up.

13:13.811 --> 13:16.680
Bingo! Bye.

13:16.714 --> 13:19.115
Seeing as you're losing your friends,

13:19.150 --> 13:22.786
you might wanna get closer to your family.

13:22.820 --> 13:25.354
If that means getting to know
Jeff and being nicer to him,

13:25.389 --> 13:28.157
I'm already doing that. I know. But why?

13:28.191 --> 13:29.558
Why are you doing that?

13:29.593 --> 13:31.961
It's called reverse psychology.

13:31.995 --> 13:33.863
The more we pretend to like this guy,

13:33.897 --> 13:36.432
the less Mom's gonna feel like she needs
to rebel against us and get married to him.

13:36.466 --> 13:38.300
I don't think so. I can prove it to you.

13:38.335 --> 13:41.604
You're the doctor. Go ahead. Prove it.

13:41.638 --> 13:44.440
Tonight. But I have to go.

13:45.843 --> 13:49.445
Grace, Grace, Grace.

13:49.479 --> 13:52.748
Dad, can the lecture wait?
I'm gonna be late.

13:52.783 --> 13:55.451
I just wanna make sure you're
clear here about what to do.

13:55.485 --> 13:58.621
As soon as you see Amy,
you pull her aside and you talk to her.

13:58.655 --> 14:01.591
You apologize. You're sorry,
and it's not gonna happen again.

14:01.625 --> 14:04.227
Dad, I-- It's not gonna happen agai
n-- you and Adrian.

14:04.261 --> 14:06.796
Not gonna happen. Don't you
think that's my decision?

14:06.831 --> 14:08.865
Mine and Adrian's?
You said you made a mistake.

14:08.900 --> 14:11.935
You made a mistake. You gonna make
the same mistake a second time?

14:11.970 --> 14:13.970
It's just, if I wanna
make that type of mistake,

14:14.005 --> 14:16.841
then I think it does have to be my decision,

14:16.875 --> 14:19.477
not that I'd be stupid enough
to do that again, but--

14:19.511 --> 14:21.679
You're not gonna do it again.
All right. But--

14:21.713 --> 14:23.281
Yeah. No "butts," mister.

14:23.315 --> 14:26.584
Amy? Apologize to Amy for
having sex with Adrian?

14:26.619 --> 14:29.821
Why? Amy's not interested in me.
She doesn't care about me.

14:29.855 --> 14:32.023
She doesn't care what I do
with Adrian or any other girl.

14:32.058 --> 14:33.958
Amy did care about you, Ben.

14:33.993 --> 14:36.161
Remind her that you're a
man worth caring about.

14:36.195 --> 14:37.862
She was the first girl you ever loved.

14:37.897 --> 14:39.864
You were the first guy she ever loved.

14:39.899 --> 14:42.100
And that's special, Ben.
It really is-- that first love.

14:42.134 --> 14:45.036
But you behaved as if Amy
meant nothing to you...

14:45.070 --> 14:47.705
and your friendship with
Ricky meant nothing to you.

14:47.739 --> 14:51.041
I mean, I'm still shocked you would do this,
not to mention disappointed.

14:51.076 --> 14:54.012
Are you trying to make me feel guilty,
or guiltier than I already feel?

14:54.046 --> 14:56.948
Guilt isn't necessarily a bad thing,
I'll tell you that.

14:56.983 --> 15:00.519
Yeah, I hope you do feel guilty. Plenty
guilty. Guilty enough so you don't do it
again.

15:00.553 --> 15:02.454
You're the one who sent me to Bologna.

15:02.488 --> 15:04.189
You knew this was gonna
happen sooner or later.

15:04.223 --> 15:06.091
But that's not why I sent you to Bologna.

15:06.126 --> 15:09.495
And if it did happen, you could get over it.
Put it in perspective.

15:09.529 --> 15:12.165
But it shouldn't have happened
with Adrian, for Pete sakes.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.068
Sex is a part of life, Ben.

15:14.102 --> 15:15.869
It's one of the best parts of life.

15:15.904 --> 15:18.806
But it's not everything in life.
It's not the most important thing in life.

15:18.841 --> 15:20.876
Says the man who's marrying Betty.

15:22.545 --> 15:24.446
Oh, God.

15:24.480 --> 15:26.314
I'm-- I'm so sorry.

15:26.349 --> 15:29.551
That slipped out. I didn't mean it.

15:29.585 --> 15:32.955
You find Amy and Adrian,
and you apologize to them.

15:32.989 --> 15:35.057
And I'll find Ricky so you can give him...

15:35.091 --> 15:37.626
the necessary apology as well.

15:37.660 --> 15:40.762
And then I'm gonna decide if you
can still live in my house...

15:40.797 --> 15:43.332
after saying that to me.

15:49.172 --> 15:50.806
What is it, the dog?

15:50.840 --> 15:52.808
He doesn't have to come in here.
He didn't wanna come in here.

15:52.843 --> 15:54.677
Did you, Moose? Go ahead.

15:55.746 --> 15:58.381
It wasn't the dog. Where were you?

15:58.415 --> 16:00.182
You missed me, huh? Just took Ash to school.

16:00.217 --> 16:02.084
Well, you were supposed
to be watching Robie...

16:02.119 --> 16:04.320
while I go to the gym before
you went to work. I forgot.

16:04.354 --> 16:07.389
Why couldn't Amy drop off Ashley
at school? Some sister thing.

16:07.424 --> 16:09.425
That you thought you'd get in the middle of.

16:09.459 --> 16:11.026
Does Ashley know where Ricky is?

16:11.061 --> 16:12.694
No. I asked her.

16:12.729 --> 16:15.096
And when you think about it,
why would she know where he is?

16:15.131 --> 16:17.566
Well, I'll tell you why.
Because she's the only girl around here...

16:17.600 --> 16:19.734
who isn't interested in having sex with him.

16:19.768 --> 16:21.502
She's probably the only
one who's had more...

16:21.537 --> 16:23.270
than a five-minute conversation with him.

16:23.305 --> 16:25.739
Well, she doesn't know. She told me
she doesn't, and I totally trust her.

16:25.774 --> 16:27.874
Did she tell you why she and Amy
aren't talking to each other?

16:27.909 --> 16:29.843
I have no idea why they're
not speaking to each other.

16:29.877 --> 16:32.044
Don't you think it's because
Ashley told you about the kiss,

16:32.079 --> 16:34.680
and then you talked to Ricky,
and that set everything else off?

16:34.714 --> 16:36.748
I'm not surprised that Amy
isn't talking to Ashley.

16:36.783 --> 16:38.750
I am surprised that she's speaking to you.

16:38.784 --> 16:40.218
She is speaking to you, isn't she?

16:40.252 --> 16:42.253
Yeah, she's speaking to me.
And according to my research,

16:42.288 --> 16:43.788
she doesn't care that Ricky is gone,

16:43.822 --> 16:46.024
so why would she care that I told
Ricky and set off everything else?

16:46.058 --> 16:47.692
She doesn't care? No.

16:47.726 --> 16:49.494
You're talking to teenagers.

16:49.529 --> 16:51.196
Your research is flawed. She cares.

16:51.230 --> 16:53.531
No, she doesn't. She kissed Ricky.

16:53.566 --> 16:56.834
She still has feelings for him.
Now that she's not angry at him anymore,

16:56.869 --> 16:58.937
she's just trying to figure out what
those feelings are. What about Ben?

16:58.971 --> 17:01.339
Does she still care about Ben?
Now she's angry at Ben.

17:01.374 --> 17:04.142
If she ever reaches the point where she's
not angry with Ben, she'll be trying to
figure out...

17:04.175 --> 17:06.211
what her feelings are about him, too.
And in the meantime?

17:06.244 --> 17:08.246
In the meantime, she'll be dating Jimmy.

17:08.280 --> 17:10.882
Geez. So how you feeling about me?

17:11.983 --> 17:13.785
Well, I'm kind of in...

17:13.819 --> 17:16.487
the same place that Amy
is about Ricky and Ben.

17:16.521 --> 17:20.023
I'm not so angry at you anymore, so I'm
trying to figure out what my feelings are.

17:20.058 --> 17:23.328
And don't ask me how long that'll
take because I don't know.

17:23.362 --> 17:25.329
But it does help to work out at the gym.

17:25.364 --> 17:27.531
Kind of overdoing it,
don't you think? This whole gym thing?

17:27.566 --> 17:29.234
What's all that for? What's all what for?

17:29.268 --> 17:32.170
Oh, that new haircut and the
smoking hot body. I don't know.

17:32.204 --> 17:34.906
I just had a baby, so I'm trying
to get my before-baby figure back.

17:34.940 --> 17:37.141
Sure you're not trying to get
your before-George figure back?

17:37.175 --> 17:40.311
You haven't looked like that since you were
in college, and that's not a good thing.

17:40.345 --> 17:43.547
If you want to be with me, it'd be a good
thing, but now it's not a good thing.

17:43.581 --> 17:45.816
And I'll tell you something else-
two can play this game.

17:45.850 --> 17:48.619
If that's where you wanna go,
I'll go there with you, and I'll win.

17:51.356 --> 17:53.858
Well, I don't know what
game you're talking about,

17:53.892 --> 17:56.293
but thanks for the
"smoking hot body" remark.

17:56.328 --> 17:59.262
And can you take Robie with
you if you leave the house?

17:59.297 --> 18:01.998
I bathed him. I fed him.
He's awake and ready to go.

18:02.033 --> 18:03.867
I'm gonna go to the gym.

18:16.318 --> 18:18.319
- Did he call?
- No.

18:18.353 --> 18:20.688
Chuck didn't call either.
What's going on?

18:20.723 --> 18:21.790
We got dumped.

18:21.824 --> 18:23.191
But why? I don't know.

18:23.225 --> 18:25.260
And I doubt that we'll ever know.

18:25.294 --> 18:27.329
That's what happens. According to Jason,

18:27.363 --> 18:29.832
if they're gonna break up with us,
we'll never know.

18:29.866 --> 18:31.300
We'll just never hear from them again.

18:31.334 --> 18:32.468
Like when Jimmy dumped Amy.

18:32.502 --> 18:33.870
That was just a misunderstanding.

18:33.904 --> 18:35.871
Yeah, like that. Jimmy and Amy.

18:35.906 --> 18:37.673
Hello? But what did we do?

18:37.707 --> 18:39.775
I mean, we told them...

18:39.809 --> 18:41.709
we didn't wanna do anything stupid, like--

18:41.743 --> 18:43.877
like get married or have kids, but...

18:43.912 --> 18:45.712
No offense, Amy. Of course not.

18:45.747 --> 18:47.380
Maybe they thought we were lying.

18:47.414 --> 18:49.481
Maybe it was the pictures of us with John.

18:49.516 --> 18:52.550
What pictures? We shouldn't
have taken the pictures.

18:52.585 --> 18:55.886
The fact that we too can reproduce
probably became too real.

18:55.921 --> 18:58.355
You took pictures? But we said
we didn't wanna have babies.

18:58.389 --> 19:00.724
Guys don't even wanna hear the word "baby."

19:00.758 --> 19:02.925
Is that more crap from Jason?

19:02.960 --> 19:04.861
Good morning. Good morning, everyone.

19:04.895 --> 19:06.729
Morning. I talk to you later, Grace.

19:06.764 --> 19:08.931
Let's talk.

19:10.400 --> 19:11.966
We're not leaving.

19:12.001 --> 19:13.501
If you two wanna talk, you leave.

19:18.973 --> 19:20.873
You took pictures?

19:20.908 --> 19:22.408
Just on our phones.

19:22.442 --> 19:24.743
We didn't post them on the Internet.
We're not that stupid.

19:26.945 --> 19:29.712
Oh. Hi, Lauren, Amy.

19:29.747 --> 19:30.713
Hi.

19:30.748 --> 19:33.449
Can I ask you something, alone?

19:33.483 --> 19:34.549
Of course.

19:38.520 --> 19:40.455
Well, I'm doing something here.

19:40.489 --> 19:42.724
I'm trying to find my homework.

19:47.697 --> 19:49.831
So, I'm just gonna come out and ask you.

19:49.865 --> 19:51.933
Is it because I'm white? What?

19:51.968 --> 19:54.436
That you don't ever think about
any kind of future with me?

19:54.470 --> 19:56.705
It's because we're 16,

19:56.739 --> 19:58.406
and I just said that...

19:58.440 --> 20:00.541
in case the idea of seeing me with a baby...

20:00.575 --> 20:03.744
scared you or made you think
I wanted one, 'cause I don't.

20:03.778 --> 20:07.213
I mean, really, does any girl
in high school want a baby?

20:07.247 --> 20:10.582
And does every woman have to have one? No.

20:10.616 --> 20:13.318
No. So, it's not because I'm white?

20:13.352 --> 20:16.621
You met my stepfather? He's white.

20:16.655 --> 20:18.823
And what do I care if you're white?

20:18.857 --> 20:20.791
I didn't even notice that you're white.

20:20.826 --> 20:22.760
I don't care about color.

20:22.795 --> 20:27.164
I'm not thinking about
babies for a long, long time.

20:27.198 --> 20:29.166
And why didn't you call me?

20:29.200 --> 20:31.101
Phone restriction.

20:31.136 --> 20:33.837
Do you know how much the two
of us talked last month?

20:33.871 --> 20:36.105
From now on, I'm on pre-paid cards only,

20:36.140 --> 20:37.607
paid for with my allowance.

20:37.641 --> 20:40.609
I wanted to call you.
I heard Ricky left town.

20:40.643 --> 20:43.644
I heard he took off or something.

20:50.384 --> 20:52.017
She asked me for a ride to school.

20:52.052 --> 20:53.686
I didn't call her. I didn't volunteer.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.487
Hey, who's asking?

20:55.522 --> 20:57.990
It's really none of my business
since we apparently broke up.

20:58.024 --> 21:01.459
Yeah, apparently. What? What did I do?

21:01.493 --> 21:03.661
It was that stupid baby, wasn't it?

21:03.695 --> 21:05.262
I decided not to call you anymore...

21:05.296 --> 21:07.497
because you said you never want
to get married or have children,

21:07.532 --> 21:09.566
and it kind of freaked me out.

21:09.600 --> 21:11.567
Really?

21:11.602 --> 21:13.035
Would you, like, want to marry me...

21:13.069 --> 21:14.403
and have kids with me one day?

21:14.437 --> 21:16.938
I think so. Well, I'm 16.

21:16.972 --> 21:19.740
You know, I'm gonna go to college,
and I'm gonna have a career,

21:19.775 --> 21:22.709
and then I'm gonna think about maybe
getting married and having kids.

21:22.743 --> 21:24.043
Me, too. Okay.

21:24.077 --> 21:26.411
Okay. Okay, so we're agreed.

21:26.446 --> 21:28.814
We're back together, and we'll
just keep doing what we're doing.

21:28.848 --> 21:30.815
Yeah. All right.
You have to tell Grace Bowman...

21:30.850 --> 21:32.517
that she's gonna have to get
another ride home, okay?

21:32.551 --> 21:35.553
Okay. Bye, Jack.

21:37.089 --> 21:39.991
We're back. Ricky left.

21:40.025 --> 21:43.395
He moved out of his apartment,
and no one knows where he is.

21:43.429 --> 21:45.564
See how easy that is?
You should've just told us.

21:45.598 --> 21:47.566
And then what? Well, where is he?

21:47.600 --> 21:50.069
No one knows. Is this
because of Ben and Adrian?

21:50.103 --> 21:54.540
Maybe. Or maybe it's because
he's tired of playing daddy.

22:07.186 --> 22:09.554
Hey. Don't come near me. I have a cold.

22:09.588 --> 22:12.423
You do not have a cold. You're crying.

22:12.458 --> 22:15.125
What are you crying about,
old ex-friend of mine?

22:15.160 --> 22:18.628
Jack and Madison.

22:19.797 --> 22:22.032
I'm crying because I have no friends,

22:22.066 --> 22:25.069
I don't have a boyfriend,
I don't have a father.

22:25.103 --> 22:28.772
I have a mother, but she's getting
remarried unless I can stop her.

22:28.807 --> 22:31.274
I don't have a lot of time.
I'm on a mission.

22:31.309 --> 22:34.110
I stupidly tried to get
Jack interested in me again,

22:34.145 --> 22:36.079
and he's not, so now I just hate myself.

22:36.113 --> 22:38.281
Yeah, well, better to hate other people.

22:38.316 --> 22:40.951
You can get Jack back.
And who needs friends?

22:40.985 --> 22:42.953
Adrian, I need friends.

22:42.988 --> 22:45.522
We all need friends.

22:45.557 --> 22:49.827
So can you just be nice so
we can be friends, please?

22:49.862 --> 22:51.830
You be nice for the two of us.

22:51.864 --> 22:53.799
I've got other plans.

22:55.201 --> 22:57.169
Morning, Ben.

22:57.203 --> 23:00.171
Oh, uh, good morning, Adrian.
How are you this morning?

23:00.206 --> 23:02.106
I'm fine. How are you?

23:04.676 --> 23:06.276
Uh, have you heard from Ricky?

23:06.311 --> 23:08.278
No. Did your dad find him?

23:08.313 --> 23:11.481
But he called his parents,
so wherever he is, he's okay.

23:11.515 --> 23:13.450
At least for now. He called them?

23:16.187 --> 23:18.088
So, my father thinks...

23:18.123 --> 23:21.125
that I should apologize to you
for what happened between us.

23:21.159 --> 23:23.862
So-- You have nothing to apologize for.

23:23.896 --> 23:25.363
I'm happy to hear it.

23:25.398 --> 23:27.032
However, my father feels...

23:27.067 --> 23:29.969
that I used you to get
back at Ricky and Amy.

23:30.003 --> 23:31.971
He's almost right.

23:32.006 --> 23:33.907
We used each other,

23:33.941 --> 23:36.676
and, well, we had a lot of
fun doing it, didn't we?

23:36.711 --> 23:38.344
Yeah. Absolutely.

23:38.378 --> 23:41.046
It was a lot of fun. I thought so, too.

23:41.080 --> 23:43.548
So you don't regret it? No.

23:43.583 --> 23:45.116
Even if Ricky doesn't come back?

23:45.150 --> 23:46.684
No.

23:47.786 --> 23:50.154
So, we're still friends.

23:50.188 --> 23:52.155
Of course we're still friends.

23:52.190 --> 23:54.558
At least I hope we're still friends.

23:54.592 --> 23:57.194
I hope we'll always be friends.

23:58.229 --> 24:01.365
Why? Do you wanna do it again?

24:01.399 --> 24:03.433
Uh, you would--

24:03.468 --> 24:05.869
you would betray Ricky a second time?

24:05.904 --> 24:09.373
"Betray"? It wasn't just Ricky.
It was Amy, too.

24:09.408 --> 24:11.309
He's my friend-- Ricky.

24:11.344 --> 24:12.811
Or, he was.

24:12.845 --> 24:14.312
And you're the woman he loves.

24:14.346 --> 24:16.981
So, yeah, Adrian,
I'd say we both betrayed Ricky.

24:17.016 --> 24:19.350
I couldn't do that a second time,
I don't think.

24:19.385 --> 24:22.020
Amy, too. And Ricky's not capable...

24:22.054 --> 24:23.521
of being a friend or loving anyone.

24:23.555 --> 24:25.056
He doesn't even love himself.

24:25.090 --> 24:27.324
He loves John,

24:27.359 --> 24:29.560
and I'm pretty sure he loves you, Adrian.

24:29.594 --> 24:31.595
In fact, I know he loves you.

24:31.629 --> 24:33.363
No, he doesn't.

24:33.398 --> 24:37.268
If he did, he would've called me.

24:37.302 --> 24:41.272
So, if you wanna do it again, call me.

24:44.844 --> 24:47.412
Congratulations.

24:47.446 --> 24:49.448
I heard you finally got what you wanted.

24:49.482 --> 24:51.050
Yeah, well, I guess you did, too.

24:53.820 --> 24:55.788
If only you could've invited me in,

24:55.822 --> 24:57.423
had a slice of pizza and talked.

24:57.457 --> 24:59.725
What you really mean is,

24:59.760 --> 25:02.428
if only I hadn't gotten pregnant
by Ricky and had his baby.

25:03.797 --> 25:07.733
If only, Ben.
If only.

25:20.885 --> 25:22.786
I'm just gonna eat in my room.

25:22.820 --> 25:24.587
What, John's gonna eat in your room, too?

25:24.622 --> 25:26.589
Come on. I have dinner ready.

25:26.624 --> 25:30.059
Just go get John and have Ashley grab Robie,
and we'll all eat dinner together.

25:30.093 --> 25:31.594
Your dad said he's gonna be late,
so I thought...

25:31.629 --> 25:33.296
you and Ashley and I could
have a real dinner together.

25:33.330 --> 25:35.198
I Just...

25:35.232 --> 25:38.668
I don't feel like eating dinner together. All right, Mom?

25:38.702 --> 25:40.937
I'm just gonna eat in my room
with John. Just me and John.

25:40.972 --> 25:43.140
But it's so much easier to eat in here,

25:43.174 --> 25:45.842
and it's easier to clean up in here, too.

25:48.112 --> 25:49.413
Amy, have you been crying?

25:49.447 --> 25:50.614
No.

25:50.648 --> 25:52.282
Amy, what's wrong?

25:52.317 --> 25:53.584
Nothing.

25:56.488 --> 25:58.655
Is it Ricky or Ben? Or the new one?

25:59.824 --> 26:02.726
He said it was my fault.

26:02.760 --> 26:05.329
I don't even know what happened.

26:05.363 --> 26:06.930
And he knows I like wings.

26:06.965 --> 26:08.632
I don't even like pizza that much.

26:08.666 --> 26:11.334
Oh, Amy, you will get through this.

26:11.369 --> 26:14.271
You will. No, I won't.

26:14.305 --> 26:17.140
I won't get through this.

26:17.175 --> 26:20.376
I just-- I just wanna drop out of school.

26:20.411 --> 26:22.446
I wanna go somewhere else.
I wanna live somewhere else.

26:22.480 --> 26:25.082
Anywhere else. I don't...

26:25.116 --> 26:27.150
I mean, why does Ricky get to run away?

26:27.185 --> 26:30.286
I should be the one who
gets to run away. Oh, Amy.

26:30.321 --> 26:33.457
Mom, you ran away. No, I did not run away.

26:33.491 --> 26:35.492
I went to take care of my mom.

26:35.526 --> 26:37.795
And anyway, no one can really
run away from their problems.

26:37.830 --> 26:39.297
Their problems always follow them.

26:39.331 --> 26:40.932
Ricky ran away.

26:40.966 --> 26:42.667
Well, he'll be back. We don't know that.

26:42.701 --> 26:45.002
Is this what you're upset about?
About Ricky leaving?

26:45.037 --> 26:46.871
I am upset...

26:46.905 --> 26:48.873
because...

26:48.907 --> 26:51.776
Ben had sex with Adrian.

26:52.845 --> 26:55.714
Mama, how can he do this to me?

26:55.748 --> 27:00.786
Now we can never, ever,
ever be together again, ever!

27:00.821 --> 27:03.623
You know, and even if I wanted to...

27:03.657 --> 27:05.391
No, that's not true, Amy.

27:05.426 --> 27:07.494
Do you wanna be together
with Ben? I don't know.

27:07.528 --> 27:09.696
I just-- I know that I do not want him...

27:09.731 --> 27:12.366
to be with that wacko
living next door to us.

27:12.400 --> 27:15.002
I can't believe that your
husband sold them that house.

27:15.036 --> 27:17.004
Yeah. Me, neither.

27:17.038 --> 27:21.008
Oh, Amy, I hate to see
you so upset like this.

27:21.042 --> 27:23.344
But you're a strong woman.

27:23.378 --> 27:26.280
You know, life is full of challenges.

27:26.314 --> 27:28.249
But that's just the way
that it is right now.

27:28.283 --> 27:30.184
It's not always gonna be like that.

27:30.219 --> 27:32.019
It's difficult now that you're a teenager,

27:32.054 --> 27:34.021
but everything that you've been
through is just gonna make you...

27:34.056 --> 27:36.957
into a really strong woman
and an interesting person.

27:36.991 --> 27:38.960
You know what, Amy?

27:38.994 --> 27:40.961
You're a really good mother.

27:40.996 --> 27:44.098
You've got a really big heart.
You're a good person.

27:44.132 --> 27:46.367
Where has that gotten me, huh?

27:46.401 --> 27:48.035
I don't want to be good.

27:48.070 --> 27:50.238
Yes, you do. You wanna be a good person.

27:50.272 --> 27:51.939
You always try to do the right thing.

27:51.973 --> 27:55.075
Well, maybe I want to do the
right thing, but I don't.

27:55.110 --> 27:57.078
Ricky will be back,

27:57.112 --> 27:59.213
and I'm sure that you'll
be friends with Ben again.

27:59.247 --> 28:00.915
Maybe even more than friends with Ben again.

28:00.949 --> 28:04.251
How can you even say that?
That's never gonna happen.

28:11.926 --> 28:13.660
It's, uh-- It's Jimmy.

28:13.695 --> 28:15.595
Hi, Jimmy.

28:15.630 --> 28:18.932
No, I just...

28:26.540 --> 28:28.440
Oh, hi, Benjamin. Oh, Betty.

28:28.475 --> 28:29.942
You looking for your dad?

28:29.977 --> 28:32.211
Yeah. He hasn't come home yet, has he?

28:32.245 --> 28:34.847
No, he hasn't. Benjamin,

28:34.882 --> 28:38.817
I was hoping you could help
me pick out a china pattern,

28:38.851 --> 28:42.187
'cause your dad says that people
will be wanting to give us gifts.

28:42.221 --> 28:46.992
And, well, your china was his
and your mom's, and, well...

28:47.026 --> 28:48.959
Anyway, I don't know
anything about this stuff.

28:48.994 --> 28:51.996
I don't know either, Betty,
so I can't help you.

28:52.030 --> 28:55.599
Is there something the matter,
Benjamin? Something wrong?

28:55.633 --> 28:58.502
Something? It's more like everything.

28:58.537 --> 29:00.337
I just-- I hate myself right now.

29:00.372 --> 29:02.139
Well, you can't do that.

29:02.173 --> 29:05.809
I mean, hating yourself-- it's-
it's just a big waste of time.

29:07.211 --> 29:09.179
Did you see Amy at school today,

29:09.213 --> 29:12.483
and was it awful?

29:16.355 --> 29:19.424
If she was just angry,
I was prepared for angry,

29:19.458 --> 29:21.159
because I was angry.

29:21.194 --> 29:24.163
I was all pumped up and ready for a fight,

29:24.197 --> 29:26.866
like I was this morning with Dad.

29:26.900 --> 29:28.635
I'm such an idiot.

29:28.669 --> 29:31.738
Do you ever think that
something could happen,

29:31.772 --> 29:34.007
and you get all upset about it,

29:34.041 --> 29:36.509
and then this voice in your head...

29:36.544 --> 29:39.145
starts fighting with someone...

29:39.180 --> 29:41.181
about something...

29:41.215 --> 29:43.850
that never even happened but could happen?

29:43.885 --> 29:48.121
Yeah, I, uh, did that this morning.

29:48.156 --> 29:50.157
I thought Amy was gonna walk up to me...

29:50.191 --> 29:52.793
and slap me and say, "This is for Adrian."

29:52.827 --> 29:54.862
And I would say, "It was worth it."

29:54.896 --> 29:56.797
And she would say, "I hope so."

29:56.832 --> 30:00.201
And I would say, "And I hope it was
worth kissing Ricky. So there."

30:00.235 --> 30:02.704
Yeah. And it didn't go that way, did it?

30:02.738 --> 30:04.205
No, it didn't.

30:04.240 --> 30:06.374
I used to go down to this little diner...

30:06.409 --> 30:08.443
down in Toluca Lake,

30:08.477 --> 30:11.880
and I used to see your dad there sometimes.

30:11.914 --> 30:14.215
And I just thought,

30:14.250 --> 30:17.753
wow, he is so cute.

30:17.787 --> 30:21.289
And in my head,

30:21.323 --> 30:23.925
I would go over and introduce myself,

30:23.960 --> 30:28.530
and he would say, "Oh, hey,
nice to meet you, Betty.

30:28.565 --> 30:30.265
Can I buy you breakfast?"...

30:30.300 --> 30:32.901
And then I would say,

30:32.935 --> 30:35.937
"Oh, yeah, not only can
you buy me breakfast,

30:35.972 --> 30:38.307
"but you can buy me...

30:38.341 --> 30:41.544
'cause I'm that kind of girl."

30:41.578 --> 30:43.813
And then he would say,

30:43.847 --> 30:46.883
"Oh, yeah? Well, I'm not that king of guy.

30:46.917 --> 30:48.818
"Why don't you get away from me, you--

30:48.853 --> 30:50.987
you dirty bird?"...

30:51.021 --> 30:53.688
But one day, I just decided...

30:53.723 --> 30:56.024
I'm not gonna listen to
that voice in my head,

30:56.058 --> 30:59.994
and I walked over to your dad and I said,

31:00.028 --> 31:03.063
"Hi. Can I buy you breakfast?"...

31:03.098 --> 31:06.399
And-- And he laughed,

31:06.434 --> 31:10.136
and he said, "Sure. Have a seat."

31:10.171 --> 31:13.039
And then I immediately
tried to explain to him...

31:13.073 --> 31:16.209
what I did for a living, you know,

31:16.243 --> 31:18.278
not to try to get his business.

31:18.312 --> 31:21.547
It's just, I wanted him to
know what my business was...

31:21.582 --> 31:24.317
just in case he didn't wanna be
seen having breakfast with me,

31:24.351 --> 31:28.021
you know, being such an
important man that he is.

31:28.055 --> 31:30.289
He just looked at me, and he said,

31:30.324 --> 31:33.392
"Sometimes people gotta
do what they gotta do,

31:33.426 --> 31:36.828
"and maybe you shouldn't do that anymore.

31:38.164 --> 31:40.098
"It's real dangerous,

31:40.132 --> 31:43.301
especially for a real nice girl like you."

31:43.335 --> 31:46.270
And I have to say, that's
probably the sweetest thing...

31:46.304 --> 31:48.472
a man has ever said to me.

31:48.506 --> 31:50.474
And it was at that moment that I realized...

31:50.509 --> 31:53.011
that voice in my head had been telling me...

31:53.045 --> 31:55.347
bad things about myself for so long...

31:55.381 --> 31:57.950
that I--

31:57.984 --> 32:00.319
that I could never give myself a chance.

32:00.353 --> 32:02.755
Aw, geez, Betty.

32:02.790 --> 32:05.358
You make me wanna cry.

32:05.393 --> 32:09.296
Look, I'm really sorry about
what I said to you. I really am.

32:09.331 --> 32:11.999
I don't even remember what you said.

32:12.033 --> 32:15.035
And that's not why I'm telling you this.

32:15.070 --> 32:17.037
I'm telling you this because I want you...

32:17.071 --> 32:19.873
to give yourself a chance to be who you are.

32:19.907 --> 32:22.342
I want you to give yourself a chance...

32:22.376 --> 32:25.177
to be the hopeless romantic that you are.

32:25.212 --> 32:29.348
Go for the romance.
It's so much better than just sex.

32:29.382 --> 32:31.383
And sometimes,

32:31.417 --> 32:34.820
the hopeless romantic good guy wins.

32:34.854 --> 32:36.822
Well, look at your dad.

32:40.895 --> 32:42.395
The thing is,

32:42.429 --> 32:45.132
I don't know if that's who
I wanna be anymore, Betty--

32:45.166 --> 32:47.134
the good guy.

32:47.169 --> 32:49.304
I just don't know.

32:59.792 --> 33:02.160
Oh, Hi, Honey. Hi, Grace.

33:02.195 --> 33:03.662
Looks Like You're Studying.

33:03.696 --> 33:05.663
Yeah. Maybe We Should Just Go Upstairs.

33:05.698 --> 33:07.165
Mmm. Now, Kathleen.

33:07.199 --> 33:08.933
Wait. Before You Go Upstairs,

33:08.968 --> 33:11.669
Tom And I Really Wanted To Talk
To You Guys About Something.

33:11.703 --> 33:12.970
Tom!

33:13.004 --> 33:15.305
I Think We're In Trouble. You Know.

33:15.340 --> 33:19.075
Well, Well, Well. Finally Home.

33:19.109 --> 33:21.511
I Know It's Late. I'm Sorry, Sweetie.

33:21.545 --> 33:24.380
We're Both Sorry. We're Very, Very Sorry.

33:24.415 --> 33:26.416
Please Let Me Keep Dating Your Mom.

33:26.451 --> 33:29.453
Oh, I Remember When I Was
That Happy Dating Jack.

33:29.487 --> 33:31.621
Oh, Come On. You Were Never That Happy.

33:31.656 --> 33:33.724
You're Right. But Someday,

33:33.758 --> 33:35.792
I Hope To Be As Lucky And Happy As Mom.

33:35.827 --> 33:38.428
And You'll Find Two Husbands.

33:39.864 --> 33:42.132
Thank You, Tom And Grace.

33:42.166 --> 33:43.934
What Does All This Mean?

33:43.968 --> 33:46.970
What It Means Is That We
See How Happy You Two Are,

33:47.004 --> 33:49.773
And We Really Hope To Be
A Part Of The Wedding,

33:49.807 --> 33:52.242
And We Hope You Get Married Soon,
And You're Together...

33:52.276 --> 33:54.143
And Happy For The Rest Of Your Lives.

33:54.178 --> 33:56.145
You Do?

33:56.180 --> 33:58.447
How About Tonight?

33:58.482 --> 33:59.649
Tonight?

33:59.683 --> 34:01.984
Tonight? Yes. Do It.

34:03.120 --> 34:05.656
W-well, I-i-- Well?

34:05.690 --> 34:08.994
Well, Actually, I Do Have A Dress I Bought,
You Know, Just In Case.

34:09.027 --> 34:11.330
Go Put It On. I'll Go Get My Suit.

34:11.364 --> 34:14.266
And Your Mother.

34:18.304 --> 34:20.373
So We're Really Gonna Do This?
Do You Really Wanna Do This?

34:20.407 --> 34:24.176
I Do. Save That For Later.

34:25.344 --> 34:27.346
Grace, Tom, Go Get Dressed.

34:27.380 --> 34:29.681
Tom...

34:29.716 --> 34:32.016
I'll Be Back.

34:34.721 --> 34:38.056
What Do You Say...

34:38.091 --> 34:40.659
This Is Called, Dr. Grace?

34:40.694 --> 34:42.360
Reverse Psychology.

34:42.395 --> 34:45.197
It Is Reversed...

34:45.232 --> 34:48.101
Reverse Psychology.

34:48.136 --> 34:49.835
Nice Going.

34:55.911 --> 34:57.579
Hello?

34:57.613 --> 35:00.081
Hey, Baby, How Are You?
Why Didn't You Call Me On My Cell Phone?

35:00.116 --> 35:02.016
I Was Trying To Reach Ruben, And Since...

35:02.051 --> 35:04.386
He's Not Answering His Cell Phone,
I Thought I Should Try Him At Home.

35:04.420 --> 35:07.055
He's Working Late. He's Got Some Big Trial,

35:07.090 --> 35:09.357
And He Said He Wanted Everything
Taken Care Of Before You Got Back.

35:09.392 --> 35:11.592
Oh, Well, That's Why I Was Calling.

35:11.627 --> 35:13.995
We Were Hoping We Could Take You And
Go Somewhere Over The Weekend...

35:14.029 --> 35:17.098
To Vegas Or Something Like That,
But It's Not Gonna Work Out.

35:17.132 --> 35:18.566
What Do You Mean, It's Not Gonna Work Out?

35:18.600 --> 35:20.835
I Have The Opportunity To
Pick Up Three Extra Days,

35:20.869 --> 35:23.171
And I Thought I Should Since
We're Trying To Pay The House,

35:23.206 --> 35:24.740
And We Have All These Expenses And--

35:24.774 --> 35:27.409
And What? You Two Aren't Hurting For Money.

35:27.444 --> 35:30.045
No, But A Little Extra Wouldn't Hurt,
And I Just Thought That--

35:30.079 --> 35:33.515
Mom, Don't Do This.

35:33.550 --> 35:36.051
Please Don't Do This. Do What?

35:36.086 --> 35:38.087
Don't Back Out. You Can't.

35:38.121 --> 35:40.122
I'm Not Backing Out, Baby.

35:40.156 --> 35:42.057
Who Said I Was Backing Out?

35:42.091 --> 35:44.059
I Just Need A Few Extra Days.

35:44.093 --> 35:45.427
I'm Just Being Practical About This.

35:45.461 --> 35:47.596
So Stop Being Practical And Just Do It.

35:47.631 --> 35:49.265
Adrian, I Need A Few More Days.

35:49.299 --> 35:52.101
You've Had 17 Years. Adrian--

35:52.135 --> 35:54.404
This Is My Dream, Too, You Know?

35:54.438 --> 35:57.040
How Many Dreams Do I Have To Give Up, Huh?

35:57.074 --> 35:59.341
How Many?

36:08.018 --> 36:09.618
Oh, Finally. Sorry.

36:09.653 --> 36:11.287
Why Are You Wearing A Baseball Cap?

36:11.321 --> 36:13.222
'cause I Went To A Baseball Game.

36:13.256 --> 36:15.124
Don't I Look Cute In It?
Suits My Boyish Charm.

36:15.158 --> 36:17.994
You Know, I Kind Of Have My Hands Full
With Robie And With Amy And Ashley.

36:18.028 --> 36:19.963
And John. No. Amy Takes Care Of John.

36:19.997 --> 36:21.631
If You Say So. Here. Give Robie To Me.

36:21.665 --> 36:23.333
No, No, No. I'm Gonna
Go Try To Put Him Down.

36:23.367 --> 36:25.703
Okay. Well, I Just Wanna Say Good Night.

36:25.737 --> 36:27.638
I'm Gonna Head To The Couch.

36:27.672 --> 36:30.775
Hey, George, I Was Thinking...

36:30.809 --> 36:33.145
Are Those New Jeans?

36:33.179 --> 36:35.280
Yeah. They're Low-riders.

36:37.551 --> 36:40.186
Oh, Geez, George. You Didn't
Wear Those To The Game, Did You?

36:40.220 --> 36:43.156
You Don't Like Them? Donovan Took
Me Shopping. Spruced Up My Wardrobe.

36:43.190 --> 36:44.991
Oh, I See.

36:45.025 --> 36:47.994
So Not Only Did You Go To A Game,
But You Also Went Shopping.

36:48.028 --> 36:50.363
And All The While,
I'm Just Here Being The Good Wife.

36:50.397 --> 36:52.699
Wife? Mother. I Meant Mother.

36:52.733 --> 36:54.668
You Said Wife. What I Was Going To Say...

36:54.702 --> 36:57.604
Before I Got Annoyed That You Were
Out Playing While I'm Working...

36:57.638 --> 36:59.272
Is That...

36:59.307 --> 37:00.941
I'm Not Saying That We're Gonna Have Sex.

37:00.975 --> 37:03.243
In Fact, I'm Saying That
We're Not Gonna Have Sex.

37:03.277 --> 37:05.545
But If You're Tired Of
Sleeping On The Couch,

37:05.579 --> 37:08.314
And You Wanna Sleep In The Bedroom, You Can.

37:08.348 --> 37:10.683
I Think That It Would Give Us A Chance...

37:10.717 --> 37:13.753
To Be Together And Talk Without
Actually Being Together.

37:13.787 --> 37:17.323
So I'm Just Gonna Go Try To Put Robie Down,
And Then I'll Be Back In.

37:17.357 --> 37:19.291
So If You Want, Make Yourself Comfortable.

37:23.196 --> 37:25.564
Hot-diggity-dog!

37:27.534 --> 37:28.834
Oh.

37:41.748 --> 37:43.715
Are You Gonna Wear The Baseball Cap To Bed?

37:43.750 --> 37:46.051
I Might. George, Take Off The Baseball Cap.

37:46.085 --> 37:48.053
Why? We're Not Gonna Have Sex.

37:48.088 --> 37:50.289
Take It Off.

37:55.229 --> 37:57.064
George, You Didn't!

37:57.098 --> 37:59.333
Plugs? Hair Plugs?

37:59.368 --> 38:02.436
What? You Didn't Lose All
That Weight Overnight.

38:02.470 --> 38:05.239
I'm A Work In Progress. Oh!

38:08.643 --> 38:11.078
Do You Hear That? It Sounds Like
Mom And Dad Are Really Talking.

38:11.112 --> 38:13.713
Yeah, It Sounds Like It.
Oh, I Just Wanted To Say Good Night.

38:13.748 --> 38:15.682
Oh. Good Night.

38:15.717 --> 38:18.752
You Don't Have To Whisper.
He's So Tired From Daycare.

38:18.786 --> 38:20.420
Okay. Well, Good Night, John.

38:20.454 --> 38:22.723
Good Night, Aunt Ashley.

38:24.659 --> 38:28.061
So, Have You Heard From
Ben Or Ricky Or Anyone?

38:28.095 --> 38:30.763
Jimmy. Oh, That's Good.

38:30.797 --> 38:33.699
I Don't Think I'll Ever Hear From Ben Again.

38:33.733 --> 38:35.634
I Don't Know If I Ever
Wanna Hear From Ben Again.

38:35.669 --> 38:37.268
That's Understandable, I Guess.

38:37.303 --> 38:39.571
Then Again,

38:39.605 --> 38:42.007
I Don't Know If I'd Want Adrian To Win.

38:42.041 --> 38:44.376
If You And Ben Aren't Friends Anymore,
And She's Friends With Ben,

38:44.410 --> 38:46.244
Then She Wins And You Lose.

38:46.279 --> 38:47.946
That's Okay. I'm Used To Losing.

38:47.980 --> 38:50.115
Why Don't You Try Winning For A Change?

38:50.149 --> 38:52.951
Why Don't You Try Not Telling
Dad Everything For A Change?

38:52.985 --> 38:55.086
I Knew You Were Still Upset
About That Kiss Thing.

38:56.455 --> 38:59.824
I Don't Tell Dad Everything.

38:59.858 --> 39:02.293
Oh, Yeah? What Haven't You Told Him?

39:02.327 --> 39:03.961
I Know Where Ricky Is.

39:15.007 --> 39:16.808
So You Found Me.

39:18.645 --> 39:20.979
It Wasn't Hard To Find You.

39:21.013 --> 39:23.782
You Been Living Here
Since I Was Living Here.

39:23.816 --> 39:25.317
Or Staying Here.

39:25.351 --> 39:27.786
Oh, I See. So I Guess
You Knew Where I Lived,

39:27.821 --> 39:29.521
But You Just Didn't Feel
Like Seeing Me, Huh?

39:29.556 --> 39:32.792
You Think? Why Do You Wanna See Me Now?

39:39.299 --> 39:42.401
I Thought If I Could See You,

39:42.436 --> 39:44.337
If We Could Talk,

39:44.371 --> 39:46.739
I Might Be Able To Come...

39:46.774 --> 39:50.277
To Some Understanding As To Why...

39:50.311 --> 39:53.079
You'd Let My Father Do What He Did To Me...

39:53.114 --> 39:55.415
Without Doing Anything About It...

39:55.449 --> 39:57.551
Other Than Getting Drunk Or High, I Mean.

39:57.585 --> 40:01.121
Good To See You, Too, Rick.

40:07.961 --> 40:10.662
I Wanted To Forgive You. Mmm. Mmm.

40:10.696 --> 40:13.531
I Wanted To Say That To You.
Say, "i Forgive You."

40:13.566 --> 40:18.402
But...Now That I See You,
I Don't Feel Like Forgiving You.

40:18.437 --> 40:21.505
Oh, You Just Feel Like Humiliating Me...

40:21.540 --> 40:23.740
By Pointing Out What A Bad Mom I Was?

40:23.775 --> 40:26.911
That Wasn't My Intention. Okay.

40:28.480 --> 40:30.581
Like I Said,

40:30.615 --> 40:33.517
I've Heard That Forgiving People...

40:33.552 --> 40:36.787
Gives People The Freedom To Move Forward,

40:36.821 --> 40:40.090
And I'm Looking To Move Forward.

40:40.125 --> 40:42.125
I've Made Some Mistakes,

40:42.160 --> 40:44.160
And I Don't Wanna Keep
Making The Same Mistakes.

40:44.195 --> 40:46.729
I Wanna Move Forward.
Move Forward Or Run Away?

40:49.065 --> 40:52.234
What, You In Some Kind Of Trouble?

40:52.268 --> 40:55.236
I Heard You Got A Kid Yourself.

40:55.271 --> 40:56.771
Huh?

40:57.907 --> 40:59.540
A Son.

41:03.112 --> 41:06.515
And When I Look At Him,

41:06.549 --> 41:10.086
I Just Gotta Wonder, How Did It Happen?

41:10.120 --> 41:12.722
How Does Anyone Destroy An Innocent Child?

41:14.091 --> 41:16.426
If Someone Touched My Son, I'd Kill Him.

41:16.460 --> 41:19.996
You Know What? How Would You Know If
He's Been Touched If You're Not There?

41:20.031 --> 41:23.600
I Wasn't There. Remember?
I Tried To Stop Him At First,

41:23.634 --> 41:26.069
But I Was Afraid That He Would
Kill Me And Then He'd Kill You.

41:26.103 --> 41:28.804
Sometimes I Wish He Had.
I Wish He Had Killed Me Anyway.

41:28.839 --> 41:31.140
At Least I Wouldn't Be Screwing
Up Other People's Lives.

41:31.174 --> 41:33.576
Ricky, Look, You Got Out, Okay?

41:33.610 --> 41:36.679
You Survived. I Survived, Okay?

41:36.713 --> 41:39.414
I've Got My Troubles, But I Survived.

41:39.449 --> 41:42.251
And I've Got My Troubles Because
I Cannot Forgive Myself...

41:42.285 --> 41:43.853
For Not Being Able To Stop Him.

41:43.887 --> 41:45.988
I Didn't Know How. I Tried.

41:46.023 --> 41:48.124
But You Don't Wanna Hear That.

41:48.158 --> 41:50.860
You Don't Wanna Hear How Many Times He...

41:50.894 --> 41:53.062
Beat Me Up Or How Many Ribs He Cracked...

41:53.096 --> 41:55.230
Or How Many Times He Locked Me
Out And Left Me On The Street.

41:55.265 --> 41:57.466
No. It's...

41:57.500 --> 41:59.935
He Broke Me.

41:59.970 --> 42:02.338
Okay, I'm Broken.

42:02.372 --> 42:05.708
But You Look Like You're Doing Okay.

42:05.742 --> 42:07.276
I Mean, You Know, I...

42:09.712 --> 42:13.115
I Hear You're Doing Okay.

42:13.149 --> 42:15.550
The Day I Heard...

42:15.584 --> 42:17.552
You Got Your Father Sent Away,

42:17.586 --> 42:21.356
I Started This Little
"thank You" Fund For You.

42:21.390 --> 42:24.492
I Just Started Saving
Whatever I Could For You.

42:24.527 --> 42:27.128
I Never Thought You'd
Actually Show Up To Get It.

42:27.163 --> 42:29.364
But...

42:30.533 --> 42:32.634
There It Is.

42:32.668 --> 42:34.336
Take It.

42:34.370 --> 42:37.639
I Never Gave You Anything Else
Except Your Lousy Life, So Take It.

42:40.477 --> 42:42.812
Maybe-- I Don't Know--

42:42.846 --> 42:45.648
You'll Go Back To Being A Daddy, You Know,

42:45.682 --> 42:49.418
And You'll Save That For A Rainy Day Or--

42:49.453 --> 42:52.155
And You Can Take Off, Whatever.
