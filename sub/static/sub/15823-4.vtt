00:09.072 --> 00:11.340
So, it's my first
death notification

00:11.374 --> 00:12.874
And I'm a little nervous.
Mm-hmm.

00:12.908 --> 00:15.235
"sorry about what happened to
your grandpa, here's my card,"

00:15.270 --> 00:16.568
You know, blah, blah, blah.

00:16.602 --> 00:18.417
Anyway, I'm about
halfway out the door

00:18.452 --> 00:20.245
When my partner, Ray,
says to me,

00:20.279 --> 00:23.844
"hey, knucklehead, before
they show up to see the body,

00:23.878 --> 00:26.233
"you maybe want to go inside
and tell the family

00:26.268 --> 00:28.815
That grandpa
is missing his head!"

00:34.115 --> 00:35.586
The grandfather had...

00:35.621 --> 00:36.792
No head!

00:43.588 --> 00:45.058
So, I'm sure you two don't date

00:45.095 --> 00:46.731
<i>All of your
first-class passengers.</i>

00:46.766 --> 00:48.471
Oh, no, no.

00:48.506 --> 00:50.009
Just the cute ones.

00:51.316 --> 00:52.952
Are you, uh,
enjoying your drive?

00:52.987 --> 00:54.458
Because if you're tired...

00:54.492 --> 00:57.634
Oh, not at all, darlin'.
I could go all night.

01:00.074 --> 01:01.678
<i>Your destination is ahead.</i>

The skies look very friendly.

01:13.376 --> 01:15.044
You got everything you need?

01:27.976 --> 01:29.480
My friend Ryan's
in the guest room.

01:29.514 --> 01:31.252
Oh! Shh!
Do you know
how to be quiet?

01:31.286 --> 01:32.621
I think so.

01:32.656 --> 01:33.791
Well, that's too bad.

01:33.825 --> 01:35.295
'cause I only know
how to be loud.

01:36.932 --> 01:39.770
oh, God.

01:42.577 --> 01:46.883
<i>Whoa!
I love the bovine motif.</i>

01:46.917 --> 01:48.854
Do you?
Yeah!

01:48.888 --> 01:51.293
I think I may have been a cow
in another life.

01:52.663 --> 01:56.304
Hey, how 'bout
a little "moo-sage"?

01:57.507 --> 01:59.677
There's baby oil
in the bathroom.

02:28.895 --> 02:30.396
20 minutes.

02:30.430 --> 02:33.201
20 minutes. Baby oil.

02:33.236 --> 02:36.172
â™ª baby oil â™ª

03:27.672 --> 03:30.542
15 minutes.

03:30.576 --> 03:33.246
15 minutes. Heh.

03:40.356 --> 03:43.493
Hey, Mr. Policeman...

03:43.527 --> 03:44.995
What do you think about these?

03:49.636 --> 03:51.271
<i>How would you feel
about a real pair?</i>

03:51.305 --> 03:52.605
What?

03:52.640 --> 03:54.408
Your friend Ryan...

03:54.442 --> 03:56.310
Is he about 6 feet tall?

03:56.344 --> 03:58.412
Lots of tattoos?
Not so talkative?

03:58.446 --> 03:59.279
Why?

04:11.224 --> 04:12.923
Oh, my God!

04:12.957 --> 04:14.190
Who is that?

04:14.225 --> 04:16.325
You really don't know him?

04:16.358 --> 04:17.858
No!

04:17.894 --> 04:19.160
Oh, my God!

04:19.195 --> 04:21.795
Oh, my God!

04:33.140 --> 04:35.707
Hmm, 93 degrees.

04:45.416 --> 04:47.651
So, uh, there's no sign
of forced entry,

04:47.685 --> 04:49.719
Suggesting that our missing
flight attendant, Ryan Wade,

04:49.753 --> 04:51.220
Either opened the door
for the victim

04:51.255 --> 04:53.722
Or he possibly picked him up,
brought him home for a hook-up.

04:53.757 --> 04:54.757
Really?

04:54.791 --> 04:56.725
People still pick up
strangers for sex

04:56.759 --> 04:58.693
In this day and age?

05:00.696 --> 05:03.164
all right. Ma'am...

05:03.198 --> 05:05.899
Was your friend Ryan
the sort to bring home

05:05.933 --> 05:08.134
Someone like the man
lying dead in the bathtub?

05:08.168 --> 05:09.535
I don't know.

05:09.569 --> 05:10.869
I mean, I can't say.

05:10.904 --> 05:12.904
Which is it... you don't know
or you can't say?

05:12.939 --> 05:14.205
I barely know Ryan.

05:14.240 --> 05:16.407
But if I ever thought he'd bring
a man like that home,

05:16.441 --> 05:18.208
I never would have given him
the key.

05:22.613 --> 05:24.814
Lieutenant,
rather than just sit here,

05:24.848 --> 05:26.849
Why don't you get up
and join the investigation?

05:27.851 --> 05:29.751
You know, chief,
I-I don't think

05:29.785 --> 05:32.219
Standing up is such
a good idea right now.

05:33.955 --> 05:36.189
Chief,
the victim's got no I.D.,

05:36.223 --> 05:38.524
Coroner's investigator says
he's almost full lividity,

05:38.558 --> 05:40.092
Liver temperature's 93 degrees,

05:40.126 --> 05:41.826
Placing time of death
around 9:00 P.M.

05:41.861 --> 05:43.427
That's good news.

05:43.462 --> 05:44.661
Why?

05:44.696 --> 05:46.629
The girls came back here
after our flight,

05:46.663 --> 05:49.597
But by 8:00 P.M.,
we were all out having dinner

05:49.632 --> 05:50.898
At Musso and Frank's.

05:50.933 --> 05:52.899
Yes, lieutenant,
it's always good news

05:52.934 --> 05:54.567
When suspects in a homicide

05:54.601 --> 05:56.435
Can point to us
for their alibi.

05:56.469 --> 05:57.936
Also, chief, I think our killer

05:57.971 --> 06:00.705
Left big, stubby fingerprints
practically everywhere.

06:00.739 --> 06:02.673
well, um,
some of those fingerprints

06:02.707 --> 06:04.274
Might be...

06:04.308 --> 06:05.909
...Mine.

06:07.144 --> 06:08.444
Two hands on the sink?

06:08.478 --> 06:10.279
Palm on the mirror?

06:10.313 --> 06:11.947
Not the murder weapon?!

06:11.981 --> 06:13.716
Yes, tao, yes!

06:13.751 --> 06:15.285
All right?!

06:15.319 --> 06:17.788
Look, at first, I didn't know
I was in a crime scene,

06:17.823 --> 06:20.791
And I-I didn't clean up
after myself because

06:20.825 --> 06:24.093
I didn't want to run
the risk of wiping away
the killer's prints.

06:24.127 --> 06:25.795
My actions throughout

06:25.829 --> 06:28.797
Have been as highly professional
as always.

06:28.832 --> 06:30.166
Chief.
Hmm?

06:30.200 --> 06:31.933
Do you want me to book these
into evidence?

06:36.804 --> 06:38.538
No.

06:38.572 --> 06:40.907
I'll run everything,
including our Juan Doe's prints,

06:40.941 --> 06:42.809
Through AFIS.

06:42.843 --> 06:43.977
Just to be clear...

06:44.011 --> 06:45.945
We're calling this
a major crime because...

06:45.980 --> 06:48.514
Look, whenever a member of
my division stumbles on a body,

06:48.548 --> 06:50.115
It is automatically
a major crime.

06:51.818 --> 06:53.218
All right, uh,
Detective Gabriel,

06:53.252 --> 06:54.553
With me, please, to the morgue.

06:54.587 --> 06:56.320
And lieutenants
Flynn and provenza,

06:56.354 --> 06:57.954
Let's take our suspects
downtown,

06:57.988 --> 07:00.419
Read them their rights,
and try to keep them
happy and talking.

07:00.453 --> 07:01.585
Easy enough, chief.

07:01.619 --> 07:03.584
We were keeping them
happy and talking before.

07:03.619 --> 07:04.885
Yeah.

07:17.031 --> 07:18.765
Ashley believes

07:18.800 --> 07:22.469
That she might have been a cow
in a previous life.

07:28.843 --> 07:30.009
Can you stand up yet?

07:30.043 --> 07:31.577
Give me five minutes, would ya?

07:31.612 --> 07:33.145
Fine, but according to the ad,

07:33.180 --> 07:35.313
Pretty soon you're gonna
have to call a doctor.

07:36.416 --> 07:38.483
The second cervical vertebrae
is shattered,

07:38.517 --> 07:40.218
Which would have caused
paralysis of the diaphragm

07:40.252 --> 07:41.785
And instant suffocation.

07:41.820 --> 07:44.087
Wait, wait, are you saying
the killer broke this guy's neck

07:44.122 --> 07:45.388
With a baseball bat?

07:45.423 --> 07:46.923
Uh, doubtful.

07:46.957 --> 07:48.224
<i>I mean, an athlete
with your physique</i>

07:48.258 --> 07:49.525
Could have done that,

07:49.559 --> 07:51.126
But from what I can see,

07:51.160 --> 07:52.360
The person you're looking for

07:52.395 --> 07:55.163
Wasn't picked first
in gym class.

07:55.197 --> 07:57.866
I count 83 bruises...

07:57.900 --> 07:59.200
Hello? Gabriel here.

07:59.235 --> 08:01.136
Suggesting the assailant
closed their eyes

08:01.170 --> 08:02.203
And swung randomly.

08:02.237 --> 08:04.205
Looks to me
like Juan broke his neck

08:04.239 --> 08:05.438
When he tripped in the tub.

08:05.473 --> 08:07.374
Frankly, I'm not even sure
I would call this a murder.

08:07.409 --> 08:09.312
Seems to me more like, uh...

08:09.347 --> 08:10.482
An accidental death

08:10.516 --> 08:12.150
In the middle of someone else's
hissy fit.

08:12.185 --> 08:13.685
Okay.
I will let her know.

08:13.720 --> 08:16.154
Chief, AFIS identified
our victim...

08:16.189 --> 08:17.555
Jose Coto.

08:17.590 --> 08:19.290
He's got numerous arrests
for narcotics

08:19.324 --> 08:22.994
And connections to a local
up-and-coming drug ring.

08:23.028 --> 08:24.094
Thank you, Detective.

08:24.129 --> 08:25.629
So the baseball bat
didn't kill him?

08:25.663 --> 08:27.397
No, though it probably
really annoyed him

08:27.432 --> 08:28.965
As he was dying
from a broken neck.

08:31.268 --> 08:32.902
Anyway,
his name was raj,

08:32.936 --> 08:34.303
And we knew
he was about to drop dead

08:34.337 --> 08:36.837
'cause he weighed
about 900 pounds!

08:36.871 --> 08:39.140
So, how does a criminal
with a drug history

08:39.174 --> 08:42.243
End up dead in the bathroom
of a stewardess's condo?

08:42.277 --> 08:43.744
Uh, I think they're called

08:43.778 --> 08:45.378
Flight attendants now, chief.

08:45.413 --> 08:46.746
Really?

08:46.780 --> 08:49.081
We searched Ashley's condo.

08:49.116 --> 08:50.516
No drugs or cash,

08:50.550 --> 08:52.184
But we found the missing
flight attendant,

08:52.218 --> 08:53.652
Uh, Ryan Wade's, cellphone.

08:53.686 --> 08:57.088
And it was on...
and no incoming calls.

08:57.122 --> 08:59.723
Okay, I'd like the apartment
gone over again, please,

08:59.758 --> 09:01.692
This time by drug dogs.

09:01.726 --> 09:02.926
Detective Gabriel?

09:02.960 --> 09:04.394
Uh, yes, uh, chief.

09:04.429 --> 09:07.364
Wade made about, uh,
$30,000 last year...

09:07.398 --> 09:08.732
Most of it
from colonial airlines.

09:08.766 --> 09:11.267
And I sent signs
of money trouble.

09:11.301 --> 09:12.602
And what about the women?

09:12.636 --> 09:14.570
Well, I, uh...

09:14.604 --> 09:17.072
Haven't done
their financials yet,

09:17.106 --> 09:20.075
But, um, neither one of them
have criminal records.

09:20.109 --> 09:22.743
Thank you. So much.

09:23.978 --> 09:26.212
I mean, I know what a casket's
supposed to weigh,

09:26.247 --> 09:29.048
<i>And this was really heavy.</i>

09:34.087 --> 09:37.222
Now, how we all doin'?

09:37.256 --> 09:39.623
We're tired,
and y'all are treating us

09:39.657 --> 09:41.592
Like we had something to do
with whatever happened

09:41.626 --> 09:43.394
To that horrible
"bang-ganger."

09:43.429 --> 09:45.864
For all we know,
your acquaintance Ryan Wade

09:45.898 --> 09:48.268
Is out on some kind
of murderous rampage.

09:48.301 --> 09:50.101
What if we sent you home
and he killed you, too?

09:50.136 --> 09:52.370
How would that make us look?

09:52.404 --> 09:55.072
Maybe somebody kidnapped Ryan.

09:56.441 --> 09:58.375
Now, who would do that?

09:59.743 --> 10:02.111
Well, obviously
you don't watch the news

10:02.146 --> 10:03.412
'cause if you did,

10:03.446 --> 10:05.214
You would know that there
are all kinds of people

10:05.248 --> 10:07.649
Doing all sorts
of terrible things

10:07.684 --> 10:09.618
For no reason whatsoever.

10:09.652 --> 10:11.319
That's true.
Yeah.
Yeah.

10:11.353 --> 10:14.054
You know, this is what I get
for being nice.

10:14.088 --> 10:15.321
I know!

10:15.356 --> 10:18.256
The only reason I even
offered Ryan my guest room

10:18.291 --> 10:20.758
Was so he didn't have
to spend the night in
that awful trailer.

10:20.793 --> 10:22.759
Ohh! God.

10:24.195 --> 10:26.496
What trailer?

10:26.530 --> 10:28.530
Flight crews
don't get layovers

10:28.564 --> 10:30.565
In fancy motels anymore.

10:30.600 --> 10:33.135
In between trips, nearly
everyone has to stay here.

10:33.169 --> 10:35.404
Hi, don.

10:36.506 --> 10:38.674
Remember that emergency landing
on Puget sound

10:38.708 --> 10:40.275
About five years back...
the hero pilot?

10:40.309 --> 10:43.844
Captain don Ellis.
Retired air force lieutenant.

10:43.878 --> 10:45.146
He lives here now?

10:45.179 --> 10:47.612
Yeah, 10 days a month.
You can't beat the price.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.246
And if you ever need
to take a shower,

10:49.281 --> 10:51.514
You can always use the 24-hour
fitness around the corner.

10:51.548 --> 10:54.247
Good morning, Margie!

10:55.517 --> 10:57.453
You on a first-name basis
with everybody around here?

10:57.487 --> 10:58.655
Yeah, pretty much.

10:58.689 --> 11:01.628
I'm kind of the unofficial
"mayor" of lot b.

11:01.662 --> 11:03.765
Ah! Uh, this is the one
you're looking for.

11:03.799 --> 11:06.269
This is where Ryan Wade
would be staying.

11:06.303 --> 11:07.938
Yeah.

11:11.410 --> 11:15.546
l.A.P.D.!

11:18.916 --> 11:20.817
We've got a warrant.
Go for it.

11:25.055 --> 11:25.988
Chief!

11:32.028 --> 11:34.729
We've found our missing
flight attendant.

11:36.932 --> 11:39.499
Ginger thinks drugs were here.

11:39.533 --> 11:42.368
I'm guessing whoever shot him
didn't need a silencer!

11:54.585 --> 11:56.252
To be fair, commander,

11:56.287 --> 11:58.287
Your new office
isn't really a cubicle.

11:58.321 --> 11:59.721
It's more like a...

11:59.756 --> 12:01.590
<i>Super cubicle.</i>

12:01.624 --> 12:03.224
It has no door.

12:03.259 --> 12:05.993
Well, as you know,
many layoffs are coming,

12:06.028 --> 12:07.529
And hopefully
when space opens up,

12:07.563 --> 12:09.497
We can find you an office
more to your liking.

12:09.532 --> 12:12.400
Thank you, chief.

12:16.506 --> 12:18.274
30 years on the force,

12:18.309 --> 12:19.775
And I get a cubicle.

12:19.810 --> 12:22.044
A cubicle!

12:25.315 --> 12:27.617
More complaints
about the building?

12:27.651 --> 12:29.588
And how can I help you?

12:29.622 --> 12:32.658
Major crimes has begun
a murder investigation

12:32.693 --> 12:34.259
That appears drug-related.

12:34.294 --> 12:35.694
We could really use
some help.
Can't do it.

12:35.728 --> 12:38.630
Ever since we started asking
for full financial disclosure

12:38.664 --> 12:41.365
From our narcotics detectives,
they've all transferred...

12:41.400 --> 12:43.701
One of the many things
I'll fix when I'm chief.

12:43.735 --> 12:46.203
What's your case about, anyway?

12:46.238 --> 12:48.539
well,
before you get angry,

12:48.573 --> 12:51.108
Uh, last night, lieutenants
Lynn and provenza...

12:51.142 --> 12:52.876
Yeah, already angry.

12:52.911 --> 12:54.844
what have
they done this time?

12:54.878 --> 12:58.445
While escorting a fugitive
back from Dallas,

12:58.480 --> 13:01.014
They struck up a date with
a couple of stewardesses.

13:01.048 --> 13:02.281
What is this, the '70s?

13:02.316 --> 13:04.550
And, in accompanying
his date back to her condo,

13:04.584 --> 13:06.218
Lieutenant provenza
found the body

13:06.253 --> 13:08.820
Of a known drug trafficker
in the bathroom.

13:08.855 --> 13:11.055
Another colleague staying there
was missing

13:11.090 --> 13:12.357
But has since turned up.

13:12.391 --> 13:13.691
Okay, well, that's good.

13:13.725 --> 13:15.225
Only he turned up dead...

13:15.260 --> 13:16.727
In a trailer...

13:16.761 --> 13:19.563
Where drugs had been present
but couldn't be found.

13:19.597 --> 13:23.233
Okay, so we have missing drugs
and two dead bodies.

13:23.268 --> 13:25.469
any suspects?

13:25.503 --> 13:26.704
Only the women...

13:26.738 --> 13:28.806
Who were with lieutenants
Flynn and provenza

13:28.840 --> 13:30.573
During the time
of the first death.

13:30.608 --> 13:32.308
Ohh.
Flynn and provenza.

13:33.410 --> 13:35.377
Do you have any idea
how difficult it is

13:35.411 --> 13:37.043
To explain
this kind of behavior

13:37.077 --> 13:39.945
When you're applying
to be chief of police?

13:41.247 --> 13:42.714
I might.

13:43.849 --> 13:45.249
What does that mean?

13:45.283 --> 13:48.551
I've been drafted to apply
for the chief's position.

13:48.585 --> 13:50.653
Believe me, it wasn't my idea.

13:50.687 --> 13:53.555
Drafted...
who exactly drafted you?

13:53.590 --> 13:55.757
The l.A.P.D. Women's
coordinator, Captain Raydor.

13:55.792 --> 13:58.026
She was concerned
that other female officers

13:58.060 --> 14:00.461
From within the department
weren't applying.

14:08.401 --> 14:09.868
I need a day
to think about this.

14:09.903 --> 14:11.203
What?

14:12.572 --> 14:14.773
I said I need a day
to think about this!

14:14.807 --> 14:17.708
Considering that I hired you,
I brought you here,

14:17.743 --> 14:20.143
And I've backed you up
in every confrontation

14:20.178 --> 14:21.711
You've provoked
over the last five years,

14:21.746 --> 14:23.379
I don't think that's much
to ask. Do you?

14:25.783 --> 14:28.584
Fine. We'll talk about it
tomorrow.

14:28.618 --> 14:32.287
Uh, what about my request
for narcots officers?

14:32.321 --> 14:34.189
Denied.
Fine.

14:34.223 --> 14:35.523
We'll do what we can.

14:35.558 --> 14:36.858
I certainly hope

14:36.892 --> 14:39.494
My inability to conduct
this investigation properly

14:39.528 --> 14:41.596
Doesn't end up reflecting
poorly on you.

14:52.441 --> 14:55.342
Chief, I need to talk to you
about this cubicle business.

14:55.377 --> 14:57.577
I'll be happy to discuss your
workspace with you, commander,

14:57.612 --> 14:59.378
Just as soon as I sort out
my double homicide.

14:59.412 --> 15:00.645
Thanks for understanding.

15:00.679 --> 15:02.613
Buzz, have our guests said
anything I should care about?

15:02.647 --> 15:05.148
Do you have any interest in
bronzer, lip gloss, or waxing?

15:05.182 --> 15:07.483
Uh, Detective Gabriel,

15:07.518 --> 15:09.451
Anything from the canine unit
at the condo?

15:09.486 --> 15:12.421
Uh, yes... just like in the
trailer, the dogs went crazy.

15:12.455 --> 15:15.490
And just like in the trailer,
no narcotics were found.

15:15.524 --> 15:17.725
Chief, I've gone over
all the flight logs

15:17.759 --> 15:19.993
From all the trips
that Ashley and Linda

15:20.028 --> 15:21.795
Worked on
during the past two years.

15:21.829 --> 15:24.564
It looks like they flew
with Ryan Wade over 90 times.

15:24.598 --> 15:26.098
So much for your girlfriend

15:26.133 --> 15:27.833
Barely knowing
her dead houseguest.

15:27.868 --> 15:29.901
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Chief, just
because they worked together

15:29.936 --> 15:32.237
Doesn't mean that
they knew each other.

15:32.271 --> 15:33.771
Uh, I mean,
y-y-you think

15:33.806 --> 15:36.440
I have a clue as to what
buzz does off the clock?

15:36.474 --> 15:38.174
Something else, chief.

15:38.208 --> 15:41.010
The morgue went through our
dead flight attendant's pockets

15:41.044 --> 15:42.412
And found his key
to the trailer.

15:42.446 --> 15:44.581
Given that the killer locked
the door behind them...

15:44.615 --> 15:46.916
They must have
had their own key.
Thank you, Detective.

15:46.950 --> 15:49.485
Hey, chief... Jose Coto,
the dead guy at the condo?

15:49.519 --> 15:51.920
Turns out the feds
had a flag on him.

15:51.954 --> 15:53.588
We traded calls
with the bureau,

15:53.622 --> 15:55.990
And there's an Agent who would
like a word with you.

15:57.059 --> 15:58.760
Oh. Just one second.

15:58.794 --> 16:01.830
Look, no matter what,
Ryan Wade didn't shoot himself,

16:01.864 --> 16:03.965
So there's still at least
one killer outstanding.

16:03.999 --> 16:06.366
And I want to know everything
that those women know.

16:06.401 --> 16:08.034
But, chief, l-look,

16:08.068 --> 16:10.602
I-I'm as anxious to close this
as you are.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.269
But Ashley and Linda...

16:12.303 --> 16:15.871
These are
very respectable ladies.

16:15.905 --> 16:17.706
Flynn, back me up here.
Sure thing.

16:17.741 --> 16:21.010
Chief, did we meet
these girls yesterday?

16:21.044 --> 16:22.478
Absolutely.

16:22.512 --> 16:24.479
Do we know them well?
I mean, hardly.

16:24.513 --> 16:27.281
I mean, would I stake my
reputation on their being
on the up-and-up? No.

16:27.315 --> 16:28.649
Is it possible that they...

16:28.683 --> 16:29.816
Way to back me up, Flynn!

16:29.851 --> 16:31.017
And this dead Ryan guy...

16:31.052 --> 16:32.785
I mean, he could
be mixed up with anybody.

16:32.820 --> 16:35.721
Lieutenant, has it
even occurred to you

16:35.755 --> 16:37.622
Th these women
just asked y'all out

16:37.656 --> 16:39.123
'cause they were using you?

16:39.158 --> 16:40.391
What?! That's crazy!

16:40.426 --> 16:44.394
I won't even dignify that
with a response!

16:47.731 --> 16:50.465
I know what's what.

16:50.500 --> 16:53.168
And these girls
are crazy about us!

16:55.739 --> 16:58.041
Is that so hard to believe?

17:16.457 --> 17:17.924
I'm so sorry.

17:17.958 --> 17:19.325
I've been running all over,

17:19.358 --> 17:21.459
And I should have called
to say that this murder,

17:21.493 --> 17:23.027
Which is actually now
two murders,

17:23.060 --> 17:24.762
Is taking a lot longer
than I expected.

17:24.796 --> 17:27.064
Oh, you've only just begun.

17:28.133 --> 17:31.335
Meet Miguel Diaz...
From Honduras.

17:31.369 --> 17:33.270
He owns
a freight business here,

17:33.304 --> 17:36.508
Which we suspected was enabling
a growing drug operation.

17:36.543 --> 17:38.712
Jose Coto...

17:38.747 --> 17:42.016
The guy you found last night,
also from Honduras...

17:42.050 --> 17:44.519
Was one of Diaz's drivers.

17:44.553 --> 17:47.054
Now, he shows up dead
in a flight attendant's condo,

17:47.089 --> 17:49.957
And suddenly
it all makes sense.

17:49.991 --> 17:51.625
Diaz's freight business
is a front.

17:51.660 --> 17:53.460
Lets him launder money

17:53.494 --> 17:55.262
While serving as a decoy
for the drug smuggling,

17:55.296 --> 17:58.797
Which we now believe is handled
by airline personnel.

17:58.832 --> 17:59.998
Well, as of today,

18:00.032 --> 18:01.766
Diaz has one less operative
working for him.

18:01.801 --> 18:03.134
And I got two more
down the hall

18:03.169 --> 18:04.803
I think are ready to spill.

18:04.837 --> 18:07.038
I'll let you know
what I find out.
Actually...

18:07.072 --> 18:09.106
Brenda...

18:09.141 --> 18:11.475
Honey...

18:11.509 --> 18:14.509
I've been sent here...

18:14.543 --> 18:17.443
To wheedle my way
into your investigation.

18:21.579 --> 18:24.346
This is me wheedling.

18:26.816 --> 18:30.318
Well, we are shorthanded when
it comes to narcotics, but...

18:30.352 --> 18:32.486
<i>Would you be helping me
solve my case</i>

18:32.521 --> 18:34.288
<i>Or would I be helping you
solve yours?</i>

18:34.322 --> 18:35.522
Is it impossible to think

18:35.556 --> 18:37.457
That we could work this out
happily together?

18:37.491 --> 18:39.725
Probably.

18:39.759 --> 18:41.459
But I'm willing to try.

18:41.493 --> 18:43.127
Oh, well, that's great news.

18:44.329 --> 18:46.430
Now, if you really think
these two women are involved,

18:46.464 --> 18:48.998
I don't see any rush
to break them.

18:49.032 --> 18:50.332
If we hold onto them
for a day...

18:50.366 --> 18:51.933
Are you asking me
to wait a day?

18:51.968 --> 18:53.301
Is that a problem?

18:53.335 --> 18:55.003
Yes, it is.

18:55.037 --> 18:57.239
I have a better idea.

19:00.378 --> 19:03.246
<i>We've got orange juice,
coffee, sprite.</i>

19:03.280 --> 19:05.014
<i>Uh, do you have
diet coke?</i>

19:05.048 --> 19:07.082
<i>Uh, will diet Pepsi do?</i>

19:07.117 --> 19:09.117
Have they gotten anything
out of the girls yet?

19:09.152 --> 19:11.186
No, but the girls have gotten
plenty out of them.

19:16.224 --> 19:17.858
Oh, chief, we'll clear
this stuff away for you.

19:17.892 --> 19:19.692
Uh, actually, lieutenant,

19:19.727 --> 19:22.661
I'd appreciate it
if y'all would just get out.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.362
Get out, get out, get out!

19:24.397 --> 19:26.131
Thank you. So much.

19:31.504 --> 19:35.374
Well, let me start by saying
that my officers

19:35.408 --> 19:37.443
Have made some
surprising discoveries.

19:37.477 --> 19:39.678
Ashley, you may be amazed
to learn

19:39.713 --> 19:42.047
That there were drugs
in your apartment.

19:42.081 --> 19:43.882
Drugs?

19:44.983 --> 19:47.551
<i>Y-you mean
like drug drugs?</i>

19:47.585 --> 19:52.121
How would drugs
get into Ashley's condo?

19:52.156 --> 19:53.890
You think just like
a Detective, Linda.

19:53.924 --> 19:56.925
Well, I don't know,
but I suppose

19:56.959 --> 19:59.694
That Ryan could have
carried drugs off the plane

19:59.728 --> 20:01.295
And into the condo,
taking them with him

20:01.329 --> 20:03.395
After killing the man
in the bathtub.

20:03.430 --> 20:07.666
Does that sound even
remotely possible to you?

20:11.271 --> 20:13.040
Can I be totally honest
with you?

20:13.075 --> 20:15.342
I'd love for you to try.

20:15.376 --> 20:17.343
I don't know Ryan that well.

20:17.378 --> 20:19.745
But I have always
been suspicious

20:19.779 --> 20:22.881
That he might be
some kind of drug mule.

20:24.450 --> 20:27.118
Now, why would you let
a drug mule

20:27.152 --> 20:28.686
Stay in your condo?

20:30.221 --> 20:31.588
Well...

20:31.622 --> 20:34.758
He has other
positive qualities.

20:34.792 --> 20:36.894
He's really good
with the silverware.

20:36.928 --> 20:38.362
And the trash.

20:38.396 --> 20:40.030
He keeps the galley spotless.

20:40.064 --> 20:42.599
Mm-hmm, and he's a very reliable
phone-message taker.

20:42.633 --> 20:46.069
<i>You mean he was
a reliable phone-message taker.</i>

20:46.103 --> 20:48.204
Just look at
the damn screens, Hmm?

20:48.239 --> 20:51.140
You see, when we went to that
awful trailer this morning,

20:51.174 --> 20:52.541
We found Ryan.

20:52.576 --> 20:56.778
But he was,
unfortunately, dead.

20:56.812 --> 20:59.613
Ryan's dead?

20:59.648 --> 21:01.481
Shot four times.
Twice in the head.

21:03.818 --> 21:06.786
Now, I'm sure if y'all
had known Ryan well

21:06.820 --> 21:08.488
That would have made
more of an impact,

21:08.522 --> 21:10.556
But, still, it must be
a little upsetting.

21:12.426 --> 21:14.793
I wonder who might have
killed Ryan.

21:14.828 --> 21:16.895
Always thinking
like a Detective,

21:16.930 --> 21:18.397
Aren't you, Linda?

21:18.431 --> 21:19.631
Who knows?

21:19.665 --> 21:21.065
As you've seen on the news,

21:21.100 --> 21:23.400
<i>The world
is a horrible place,</i>

21:23.435 --> 21:25.068
Specially for people

21:25.102 --> 21:26.769
<i>Who are involved
in drug drugs</i>

21:26.804 --> 21:28.771
Like Ryan seems to have been.

21:32.441 --> 21:34.508
The way...

21:34.542 --> 21:38.011
Have either of you young ladies
ever seen th man before?

21:38.045 --> 21:42.148
His name is Miguel Diaz.

21:42.182 --> 21:47.152
He's involved with drugs,
money laundering, and worse.

21:49.188 --> 21:51.122
Mnh-mnh. No.
No.

21:51.156 --> 21:52.757
No?
No.
Mnh-mnh. Sorry.

21:52.791 --> 21:54.258
Well, that's wonderful.

21:54.292 --> 21:57.595
And since y'all don't know
anything at all...

21:57.629 --> 21:59.697
And since there's nothing
connecting you

21:59.731 --> 22:01.732
To whoever shot Ryan Wade
at point-blank range,

22:01.766 --> 22:03.000
Y'all are free to go.

22:07.805 --> 22:10.737
Wait, wait. I mean,
shouldn't we be protected?

22:10.772 --> 22:11.805
From what?

22:11.839 --> 22:14.473
From the unknown.

22:14.507 --> 22:15.773
From, uh...

22:15.808 --> 22:17.639
From whoever killed Ryan.

22:17.673 --> 22:20.476
Oh, people tangled up
in drug-mule stuff

22:20.510 --> 22:22.578
Like Ryan seems to have been...

22:22.612 --> 22:23.845
Those people...

22:23.879 --> 22:25.811
They always get what
they have coming to them.

22:27.278 --> 22:29.579
You two, on the other hand,
should be just fine.

22:29.613 --> 22:31.514
All right.
Well, good luck.

22:33.884 --> 22:37.319
<i>Perhaps lieutenants Flynn and
provenza will see you out.</i>

22:39.555 --> 22:42.256
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

22:47.261 --> 22:48.795
Chief!

22:48.829 --> 22:51.097
Chief, y-y-you're not
gonna make those girls

22:51.131 --> 22:53.199
Walk out of here
to face god-knows-what.

22:53.233 --> 22:54.466
No, you and lieutenant Flynn

22:54.501 --> 22:56.668
Are gonna invite them
over to your house. Buzz?

22:56.703 --> 22:58.303
I'll get his place wired
right away, chief.

22:58.337 --> 22:59.704
As many cameras
as you can hide.

22:59.738 --> 23:00.938
Consider this your chance

23:00.973 --> 23:02.706
To prove that these women
weren't just using you.

23:02.741 --> 23:04.041
And if they were?

23:04.075 --> 23:05.842
Use them back.

23:16.581 --> 23:17.581
The only thing I
would like about

23:17.582 --> 23:19.349
Is there's not enough
good Chinese take-out.

23:19.384 --> 23:21.051
Well, maybe there
aren't enough Jews.

23:22.219 --> 23:25.454
<i>Uh, my experience has been</i>

23:25.488 --> 23:27.489
That the more Jews,
the better the Chinese food.

23:27.523 --> 23:29.924
Well, it goes back
to Moses, who said,

23:29.959 --> 23:32.027
"with ten commandments,
you get egg rolls."

23:35.798 --> 23:37.699
I don't get it.

23:37.734 --> 23:39.734
No one ever does.
Oh. Okay.

23:39.769 --> 23:42.203
Here we go.
Mmm-mmm-mmm!

23:42.238 --> 23:44.739
It's so wonderful of
you and Andy to let
us stay here tonight.

23:44.773 --> 23:46.639
Are you sure
if your boss finds out

23:46.673 --> 23:48.474
Y'all won't get
into any trouble?

23:48.508 --> 23:50.141
Not a chance.

23:50.176 --> 23:51.976
When he and I are
off the clock,

23:52.010 --> 23:53.544
Nobody tells us what to do.

23:59.916 --> 24:01.116
Would you go easy on me

24:01.151 --> 24:03.251
If you knew I smuggled
something off the plane?

24:05.754 --> 24:08.323
Buzz.

24:15.964 --> 24:17.297
Tiny wine, anybody?

24:18.833 --> 24:21.167
<i>It goes great
with take-out.</i>

24:21.201 --> 24:23.035
<i>None for me,
but you go ahead.</i>

24:23.070 --> 24:25.304
<i>You scared me there
for a second.</i>

24:26.506 --> 24:27.873
So, what's t deal
with your boss?

24:29.508 --> 24:31.175
Uh, how do you mean exactly?

24:31.210 --> 24:32.943
Well, it's like she thinks

24:32.977 --> 24:35.012
She's too good
for the beauty pageant.

24:35.046 --> 24:37.146
<i>I mean, believe me,
being from the South,</i>

24:37.181 --> 24:38.514
<i>I know her type.</i>

24:38.548 --> 24:41.583
Like when she says,
"thank you,"

24:41.618 --> 24:43.085
What she's really saying is...

24:43.119 --> 24:44.853
"you know where
you can stick that!"

24:44.887 --> 24:46.989
<i>You know, some women,
they just...</i>

24:47.024 --> 24:50.293
<i>They hit that glass ceiling,
you know,</i>

24:50.327 --> 24:52.695
<i>And they just get
so bitter.</i>

24:53.730 --> 24:55.631
Dumplings, anyone?

24:55.666 --> 24:57.533
Now, these are delicious!

24:57.567 --> 24:59.135
Don't pay attention to them.

24:59.169 --> 25:01.170
Oh, please, honestly...
do you think I care

25:01.204 --> 25:03.205
What a couple of stewardesses
say about me?

25:03.239 --> 25:05.440
Uh, I think they're called
flight attendants now, chief.

25:07.710 --> 25:10.777
We'll get to see how good
they look in orange jumpsuits.

25:13.514 --> 25:14.647
Excuse me.

25:14.681 --> 25:16.382
<i>Hello?</i>

25:16.416 --> 25:19.049
Lieutenant, let's not forget
we're here to do something

25:19.084 --> 25:22.885
And that someday this may
all get played in court.

25:22.919 --> 25:25.119
<i>No habla espaÃ±ol.</i>

25:26.921 --> 25:28.421
Oh, you speak Spanish?

25:31.258 --> 25:33.959
Ah, here we go,
oh, beautiful one.

25:33.993 --> 25:35.527
the last sip.

25:35.562 --> 25:37.129
<i>For you.</i>

25:37.163 --> 25:39.196
<i>Oh. Thank you.</i>

25:42.399 --> 25:45.867
<i>It feels so safe being here
with you two.</i>

25:45.902 --> 25:48.403
Andy, after you find
the person who killed Ryan,

25:48.437 --> 25:50.705
Will we still have anything
to worry about?

25:50.740 --> 25:52.039
Who's to say?

25:52.074 --> 25:54.041
As it is, I don't have a clue

25:54.075 --> 25:56.376
Why someone would have killed
Ryan in the first place.

25:58.045 --> 26:01.046
Do you think that it's possible

26:01.080 --> 26:04.684
That we could talk
to each other like...

26:04.718 --> 26:06.518
Like we're regular people?

26:06.553 --> 26:08.353
Yeah.

26:08.388 --> 26:10.287
I mean, could we just take off
our uniforms a minute

26:10.321 --> 26:11.521
And trust each other?

26:11.555 --> 26:13.522
Girls, listen.

26:13.556 --> 26:14.990
Flynn and I work murders.

26:15.024 --> 26:16.925
If this is about...

26:16.959 --> 26:19.626
I don't know...
drugs maybe,

26:19.661 --> 26:23.062
Believe me, we don't
give a damn about that.

26:24.464 --> 26:28.199
Well, that guy who you found
dead in the tub...

26:29.434 --> 26:32.571
Maybe we did know him a little.

26:32.605 --> 26:33.672
<i>How little?</i>

26:38.615 --> 26:41.285
A few years ago, our airline

26:41.319 --> 26:43.554
Added a flight from Honduras.

26:43.588 --> 26:47.891
The coffee we brew on the plane
comes in sealed bags.

26:47.926 --> 26:50.892
Regular has a green dot,
decaf has a yellow dot,

26:50.926 --> 26:53.360
And the bags they stocked
in Honduras with cocaine

26:53.395 --> 26:55.096
Had a white dot.

26:55.130 --> 26:56.431
We just had to make sure

26:56.465 --> 26:58.901
That we didn't accidentally
open the wrong bag.

26:58.935 --> 27:01.803
After we'd land,
we'd take all the white-dot bags

27:01.837 --> 27:03.571
And put them
in a big, black trash bag,

27:03.605 --> 27:05.439
And we were done.

27:06.607 --> 27:08.809
Jose, the guy in my bathtub,

27:08.843 --> 27:10.875
Later on,
he'd come by with cash.

27:12.644 --> 27:14.144
Well, how often was this?

27:14.179 --> 27:15.612
Once a month.

27:16.781 --> 27:18.281
Then once a week.

27:19.315 --> 27:21.382
Then every L.A. Flight
connecting from Honduras.

27:23.018 --> 27:24.452
Only, over time,
the drug people

27:24.486 --> 27:27.487
Gave us less and less for
doing the exact same thing!

27:27.522 --> 27:29.856
I mean, they said it was
the recession, but...

27:29.890 --> 27:31.457
I mean, I don't know.

27:31.491 --> 27:35.093
A girl's got to live,
so this week we decided

27:35.128 --> 27:37.795
To do something
we've never done before.

27:37.830 --> 27:39.862
Ever since the airline
stopped giving us meals,

27:39.897 --> 27:42.264
We've put our food
in little cooler bags.

27:42.298 --> 27:45.167
And yesterday Ryan took
all the white-dot packets

27:45.201 --> 27:47.637
And carried it in his bag
off the plane for us.

27:47.671 --> 27:50.573
Ryan was supposed to
hold onto the drugs

27:50.607 --> 27:53.275
Until we could sell them
to this contact I made.

27:53.309 --> 27:55.310
Only I guess
things got complicated for Ryan

27:55.344 --> 27:56.678
While we were at dinner.

27:56.712 --> 27:59.580
But you don't have any idea
who might have shot him?

27:59.614 --> 28:02.249
No, we only ever dealt
with Jose.

28:02.283 --> 28:04.017
<i>Nobody else was
involved in this?</i>

28:04.051 --> 28:05.752
<i>Besides the people
in Honduras</i>

28:05.786 --> 28:07.519
<i>Who we didn't really know,
no.</i>

28:07.554 --> 28:09.088
<i>It was just us.</i>

28:10.356 --> 28:13.191
What we did really
isn't that bad, is it?

28:13.226 --> 28:15.026
I mean, Kelly our friend

28:15.061 --> 28:16.494
Who washes hair
in a hair salon,

28:16.529 --> 28:17.996
She doesn't declare
any of her tips.

28:19.131 --> 28:20.698
<i>That is not legal.</i>

28:20.732 --> 28:23.000
Chief, you get the sense

28:23.034 --> 28:24.868
There's a hole in this story?

28:24.902 --> 28:26.503
Big enough
to fly a plane through.

28:26.537 --> 28:28.004
We are close to
a direct connection

28:28.039 --> 28:29.773
With Miguel Diaz, though.

28:29.807 --> 28:31.875
And look at this.

28:31.909 --> 28:33.843
Whenever our flight attendants

28:33.877 --> 28:37.513
Were on a plane connecting
from Honduras,

28:37.548 --> 28:40.716
It was almost always
with the same Captain...

28:40.751 --> 28:42.718
A Captain mark Wheeler.

28:58.699 --> 29:01.833
Captain Wheeler,
I'm Brenda Leigh Johnson

29:01.867 --> 29:04.167
From the l.A.P.D.,
major crimes.

29:04.201 --> 29:06.268
And this is Agent fritz Howard
from the FBI.

29:06.302 --> 29:09.036
Look, am I under arrest or
am I just being questioned?

29:09.070 --> 29:11.067
Because your officer
read me my rights

29:11.101 --> 29:13.203
And then walked off
with all my belongings.

29:13.237 --> 29:15.572
I apologize, sir. We ask people
to empty their pockets

29:15.606 --> 29:17.908
Before interviews
for our own security.

29:17.942 --> 29:19.910
A-and you are welcome
to leave,

29:19.944 --> 29:22.747
But we'd appreciate it if you'd
answer a few questions first.

29:22.781 --> 29:23.748
About?

29:23.782 --> 29:24.983
Ryan Wade.

29:26.920 --> 29:29.421
<i>So he did call
you guys, then.</i>

29:29.455 --> 29:31.488
He told he was gonna call us?

29:31.523 --> 29:33.823
Look, there's this, uh,
trailer next to the airport

29:33.858 --> 29:35.658
Where some of us stay.

29:35.693 --> 29:37.560
Anyway, Ryan burst in on me

29:37.595 --> 29:39.863
And launched into this
convoluted story

29:39.898 --> 29:42.732
About drugs and smuggling
and a guy who was dead.

29:42.767 --> 29:45.235
And, honestly, I didn't know
if he was for real

29:45.269 --> 29:48.504
Or if this was some sort
of psychotic delusion.

29:48.538 --> 29:50.105
So, what exactly did you say
to Mr. Wade?

29:50.140 --> 29:52.174
Well, that he should go
to the police.

29:53.476 --> 29:55.243
Did Mr. Wade
have drugs with him

29:55.278 --> 29:57.011
When he arrived at the trailer?

29:57.046 --> 30:00.114
No, no, he said that he had
sold them to somebody else.

30:00.148 --> 30:03.349
That's pretty much all I got
from him before I took off.

30:03.383 --> 30:05.751
And you left him
in the trailer?

30:05.785 --> 30:07.452
Ryan said he was convinced

30:07.486 --> 30:09.188
That these drug people
were after him.

30:09.222 --> 30:11.457
So I went to a hotel
because, uh,

30:11.491 --> 30:13.225
He scared the crap out of me.

30:13.259 --> 30:15.660
Well, I'm sorry
to inform you, sir,

30:15.695 --> 30:17.762
That we found Ryan Wade
yesterday,

30:17.796 --> 30:19.664
And he had been shot to death.

30:21.533 --> 30:22.933
Oh, my God.

30:28.339 --> 30:29.772
Do you have any idea

30:29.806 --> 30:32.607
How Mr. Wade's killer
might have found him?

30:34.810 --> 30:37.744
You know, uh,
Ryan came in a cab.

30:37.779 --> 30:41.214
So perhaps they followed
the cab to the parking lot.

30:41.248 --> 30:42.681
There was no break-in,

30:42.716 --> 30:44.983
And the trailer door was locked
when we discovered the body.

30:45.018 --> 30:47.551
Who else besides you and
Mr. Wade have a key?

30:48.754 --> 30:50.622
Well, obviously, the owner.

30:50.657 --> 30:52.124
And that would be?

30:52.158 --> 30:54.258
It's one of the women
we fly with...

30:54.292 --> 30:55.892
Ashley Rogers.

31:05.851 --> 31:06.851
Ashely Rogers has
two homes in LA.

31:06.852 --> 31:08.685
We found bodies
in both of them.

31:08.720 --> 31:10.455
Provenza sure can pick 'em.

31:10.489 --> 31:13.326
Chief, Wheeler said
that Ryan arrived by taxi.

31:13.360 --> 31:15.228
Uh, but we checked, and none
of the cab companies

31:15.263 --> 31:16.531
Had a pick-up
during that time

31:16.565 --> 31:18.668
Going from Ashley's condo
to the airport.

31:18.702 --> 31:20.404
Well, Ryan Wade didn't walk
to that trailer.

31:20.439 --> 31:21.706
And I'm betting he didn't fly.

31:21.740 --> 31:23.708
He may not have had to, chief.

31:23.742 --> 31:27.378
Ashley Rogers has a car
registered in Texas

31:27.413 --> 31:29.880
That's been collecting
parking tickets here in L.A.

31:29.915 --> 31:31.115
It's not in the condo's garage.

31:31.149 --> 31:32.983
It's not on
the surrounding streets.

31:33.017 --> 31:34.284
I'm betting Wade took it.

31:34.319 --> 31:36.353
So, Ashley didn't tell us
about the car...

31:36.387 --> 31:38.221
Captain Wheeler lied to us

31:38.255 --> 31:40.189
About how Wade
got to the trailer.

31:40.223 --> 31:42.557
Kind of makes you wonder
what else those two
aren't telling us.

31:42.592 --> 31:44.059
Well, I don't know,

31:44.093 --> 31:46.895
But I think starting a family
argument might help us find out.

31:46.929 --> 31:48.162
Detective Sanchez,

31:48.197 --> 31:51.131
May I see Captain Wheeler's
personal effects?

32:08.713 --> 32:10.914
Why didn't you tell us
you had a car?

32:10.948 --> 32:12.415
You never asked!

32:12.449 --> 32:14.550
And I didn't know
it was missing.

32:14.584 --> 32:17.186
And Ryan knew I wasn't insured
for an additional driver,

32:17.220 --> 32:19.855
So if he took it without
my permission, that's theft.

32:19.889 --> 32:23.057
And if Captain Wheeler says
that he didn't know about this,

32:23.091 --> 32:27.029
Well, then, he is
the biggest lying liar ever.

32:27.063 --> 32:28.730
He came to us with the idea.

32:28.765 --> 32:31.933
I bet all that cocaine Ryan had
is still in my car.

32:31.967 --> 32:34.001
And somebody's got to get it

32:34.035 --> 32:35.836
Before the drug people
come for us.

32:35.870 --> 32:38.771
Ryan probably parked it
in the personnel lot.

32:38.806 --> 32:40.439
Someone should check.

32:40.474 --> 32:42.508
We will, believe me.

32:45.278 --> 32:47.914
Uh, there's just one more thing
I want to know.

32:47.948 --> 32:52.053
And I want an honest answer.

32:52.087 --> 32:55.089
Did the two of you agree
to go out with me and Flynn

32:55.123 --> 32:57.124
Because you thought
we could keep you safe

32:57.158 --> 32:59.192
Till you got rid of the drugs
and left town?

33:00.327 --> 33:02.561
Well, not only.

33:02.596 --> 33:04.630
But maybe mainly.

33:04.664 --> 33:07.966
Yeah, this is Flynn.
Get me the chief. Thanks.

33:08.001 --> 33:10.435
So what you're saying is...

33:10.470 --> 33:13.771
You were never really
attracted to us.

33:15.074 --> 33:16.107
Not so much.

33:16.942 --> 33:18.609
But I'm sure other women are.

33:18.643 --> 33:20.077
Like, if you
ever came to Dallas,

33:20.111 --> 33:22.379
My mama would go out with you
in a heartbeat.

33:22.413 --> 33:23.614
Oh, mine too!

33:25.116 --> 33:28.885
So, they say that the Captain
was behind the whole thing.

33:28.919 --> 33:30.319
Thank you, lieutenant.

33:30.354 --> 33:32.520
Arrest them, refresh their
memories about their rights,

33:32.554 --> 33:34.420
And get them down here
as quickly as possible.

33:34.454 --> 33:36.586
You got it, chief.
See you in about 20 minutes.

33:38.487 --> 33:40.585
All right, you two,
I want you to get your stuff.

33:40.620 --> 33:42.619
We're going downtown right now.
Come on.

33:53.029 --> 33:54.596
What?

33:54.630 --> 33:56.664
Are you upset about those two?

33:56.699 --> 33:58.333
Forget about them.

33:58.367 --> 34:00.101
They're criminals.

34:00.135 --> 34:03.103
And they're not the only two
flight attendants out there.

34:03.137 --> 34:04.638
I think we just chose
the wrong airline.

34:07.207 --> 34:09.675
Chief...

34:09.710 --> 34:12.110
I went through all the keys,
and none are for the trailer.

34:12.145 --> 34:14.645
Thank you so much,
Detective Sanchez.

34:18.982 --> 34:21.149
So sorry to keep you
in a holding pattern,

34:21.183 --> 34:22.817
Captain Wheeler.

34:22.851 --> 34:24.585
Seems we're always behind
schedule around here.

34:24.619 --> 34:26.053
You know what that's like.
Hmm.

34:28.389 --> 34:30.322
There's so much you can tell
about a person

34:30.358 --> 34:32.358
From what they carry around
in their pocket,

34:32.393 --> 34:33.592
Don't you think?

34:33.627 --> 34:35.428
For example, looking at this,

34:35.462 --> 34:37.295
I'd think that you grew up
on a farm...

34:37.331 --> 34:39.800
Or maybe you just have
a thing for cheese.

34:39.833 --> 34:41.967
Am I close?

34:43.103 --> 34:44.704
Those aren't my car keys.

34:44.737 --> 34:46.572
Aren't they?
Oh, w-who do they belong to?

34:47.806 --> 34:48.873
Ashley.

34:48.908 --> 34:50.942
Ashley? A-Ashley Rogers?

34:50.976 --> 34:52.643
The woman you implied earlier

34:52.678 --> 34:54.812
Was responsible for
the murder of Ryan Wade?

34:54.846 --> 34:56.045
That Ashley?

34:56.081 --> 34:57.948
Yes, that Ashley.

34:57.982 --> 34:59.983
How is it that you have
Ashley Rogers' car?

35:01.252 --> 35:02.718
I borrowed it.

35:02.753 --> 35:05.053
Oh, that's easy enough
to confirm.

35:05.088 --> 35:07.389
Detective Gabriel,
would you please get
Ashley Rogers on the line?

35:07.423 --> 35:08.790
Uh, oh, no, okay, look.

35:08.824 --> 35:10.291
I didn't mention it before

35:10.326 --> 35:13.127
Because I didn't want
to complicate things,

35:13.161 --> 35:15.863
But I got Ashley's car
from Ryan.

35:15.898 --> 35:19.133
And that would
complicate things how?

35:19.168 --> 35:21.669
What, because if we would
have known about the car,

35:21.704 --> 35:23.071
We would have gone
and looked for it

35:23.105 --> 35:24.772
And found the cooler
full of narcotics inside

35:24.807 --> 35:26.073
With your fingerprints on it?

35:26.108 --> 35:27.808
Mark Wheeler,
you are under arrest

35:27.842 --> 35:29.209
For the murder
of Ryan Wade.
Let's go.

35:29.244 --> 35:30.644
Wait a minute!
I didn't kill Ryan!

35:30.678 --> 35:32.245
Really? That's not
how it looks to me.

35:32.280 --> 35:34.380
And that's not how it's gonna
look to a jury, either.

35:34.415 --> 35:36.048
But, wait a minute...
I-I-I'm telling you

35:36.083 --> 35:37.983
That... that when I left...
when I left that trailer,

35:38.017 --> 35:39.251
Ryan was fine.

35:39.285 --> 35:40.886
Where's your key
to the trailer?

35:40.920 --> 35:42.921
What?
Your key.

35:42.955 --> 35:44.689
You were in the trailer
when Ryan got there,

35:44.724 --> 35:47.325
So you must have had a key.
Where is it?!

35:47.359 --> 35:50.427
Do you have any idea what is
going on out there?!
Mr. Wheeler!

35:50.461 --> 35:52.729
It used to be
when people saw me coming,

35:52.763 --> 35:54.097
That they would stand
to attention.

35:54.131 --> 35:58.034
I was... I was one notch
below an astronaut.

35:58.068 --> 36:00.035
Now...

36:00.070 --> 36:02.170
I'm barely a bus driver.

36:02.205 --> 36:03.838
I get it, Captain Wheeler.

36:03.873 --> 36:05.506
Your glory days are over.

36:06.574 --> 36:08.641
Who did you give the key to?

36:10.410 --> 36:12.945
I'm arresting someone today
for the murder of Ryan Wade.

36:12.979 --> 36:14.112
It's either going to be you

36:14.146 --> 36:16.580
Or whoever
you gave that key to!

36:16.614 --> 36:18.448
I did not give that key
to anyone.

36:18.482 --> 36:20.283
I left that key
outside the door...

36:20.318 --> 36:22.018
For Miguel Diaz.

36:23.552 --> 36:26.086
And did you also leave the drugs
for Mr. Diaz?

36:26.121 --> 36:28.054
You know something?
Ryan killed his guy with a bat!

36:28.089 --> 36:30.223
Do you think t-that
returning the cocaine...

36:30.257 --> 36:31.791
That was gonna save his life?!

36:31.825 --> 36:33.825
So you figured they were
gonna kill him anyway,

36:33.860 --> 36:36.294
So why not just take the dope
and make the most of things?

36:36.328 --> 36:37.995
Where are the drugs now,
Mr. Wheeler?

36:43.268 --> 36:46.135
As far as I know, they're...
they're in Ashley's car.

36:46.170 --> 36:47.769
And where did you tell
Mr. Diaz they were?

36:49.371 --> 36:51.806
I told him
that I didn't know...

36:51.840 --> 36:54.474
That I'd look for them.

36:54.508 --> 36:55.508
Well, then...

36:57.911 --> 36:59.778
You're gonna call Mr. Diaz.

36:59.813 --> 37:01.747
You're gonna tell him
you found them.

37:06.018 --> 37:07.685
Hey!

37:07.719 --> 37:10.220
Hey, let's pick it up
in there, will ya?!

37:10.254 --> 37:12.655
Look, we'll go downtown
and we'll sort this out.

37:12.690 --> 37:14.222
Yeah.

37:14.257 --> 37:17.523
Yeah, and everyone will see
we're a couple of idiots.

37:17.558 --> 37:20.526
It's had to know how
we could look any stupider.

37:22.628 --> 37:24.195
What the...

37:27.298 --> 37:28.464
Is that your car?!

37:29.466 --> 37:31.501
Yeah.

37:31.536 --> 37:34.740
Yeah, but the joke's on them!
I'm nearly out of gas!

37:34.774 --> 37:37.645
They're going to the
airport personnel lot.

37:40.184 --> 37:43.320
Please tell me that you
are not calling the chief.

37:43.354 --> 37:44.854
I'm calling a cab.

37:53.963 --> 37:55.529
Detective Sanchez?

37:55.564 --> 37:58.265
Ready, chief.
I can see Ashley's car.

37:58.299 --> 37:59.599
Lieutenant tao?

37:59.633 --> 38:01.968
All set, chief.

38:17.515 --> 38:19.516
Okay, just make the exchange...

38:19.550 --> 38:21.217
Drugs for the money and key...

38:21.252 --> 38:22.785
And walk.

38:22.819 --> 38:25.354
We've got you covered
from all sides.

39:06.856 --> 39:08.256
What in the hell?

39:08.290 --> 39:11.158
Hey! Stop!
That's not yours!

39:11.192 --> 39:14.194
keep going! Keep going!
Go! Go! Go! Go!

39:15.262 --> 39:16.428
Go! Go! Go! Go!

39:17.630 --> 39:20.097
We see you!
Stop that cart!

39:20.132 --> 39:22.232
Police! Police!

39:22.266 --> 39:23.933
Police!
Put your hands up!

39:23.968 --> 39:25.634
get those hands
in the air!

39:25.669 --> 39:27.503
Get your hands up!
Put your hands up!

39:27.537 --> 39:29.872
Hey! Wait a minute!
Hey! Get back here!

39:29.906 --> 39:31.273
Get 'em up!
Get 'em up!

39:31.307 --> 39:32.573
This is not good.

39:35.077 --> 39:37.278
Go! Go! Go! Go!

39:37.312 --> 39:38.312
Chief, 9-mill.

39:39.580 --> 39:41.614
You guys got all this
under control?

39:41.649 --> 39:44.451
Yes, lieutenant.
Thank you so much.

39:44.485 --> 39:46.086
Good.

39:46.120 --> 39:49.054
Now where the hell is my car?!

39:49.088 --> 39:50.955
Where's my car?!

39:50.990 --> 39:52.857
Hey, you skanks!

39:52.891 --> 39:55.126
Bring me my car!

39:59.577 --> 40:02.577
Buh-bye!
Have a nice day, now!

40:02.612 --> 40:04.911
Buh-bye!
See ya again real soon!

40:04.946 --> 40:06.079
Thank you so much!

40:06.113 --> 40:07.180
No, thank you!

40:09.049 --> 40:11.283
Ah, that didn't work out
so badly, did it?

40:11.317 --> 40:13.852
Closed two murder cases
and broke a narcotics ring.

40:13.886 --> 40:15.753
And spent more time together
in the past two days

40:15.788 --> 40:17.221
Than all of last month.

40:17.256 --> 40:18.257
Happy happy.

40:18.291 --> 40:19.392
Don't stay too late.

40:19.427 --> 40:20.727
And good luck with pope, huh?

40:24.632 --> 40:26.166
Oh, commander Taylor!

40:26.200 --> 40:28.434
I love what you've done
with the space!

40:28.469 --> 40:30.769
Well, chief, you know,
it may not look it,

40:30.804 --> 40:32.705
But... but
square-foot-wise,

40:32.739 --> 40:34.639
It... it's bigger
than my old office.

40:38.576 --> 40:40.277
do you have a minute?

40:40.311 --> 40:41.944
Yeah, I've been meaning
to find you, actually,

40:41.979 --> 40:44.547
To offer my congratulations.

40:44.581 --> 40:46.216
Thank you.

40:46.250 --> 40:49.318
And to say I thought about
what we discussed earlier,

40:49.353 --> 40:51.420
And, uh, I think
you should definitely

40:51.455 --> 40:53.889
Submit your application
for chief of police.

40:53.923 --> 40:55.457
I'm only sorry I didn't
recognize that yesterday.

40:55.492 --> 40:57.025
Are you?

40:57.060 --> 40:58.293
Yeah, it seems obvious now.

40:58.327 --> 41:00.228
I mean, there should be
a high-ranking female

41:00.262 --> 41:01.863
From within the department
applying.

41:01.897 --> 41:03.931
And, uh, if there's gonna be
a woman in the candidate pool,

41:03.965 --> 41:05.866
Better it be you
than somebody else.

41:07.235 --> 41:09.369
A-a-and that's because?

41:09.403 --> 41:12.372
Well, your presence will help
deter other women from applying.

41:12.406 --> 41:15.174
And, you know, you'll be given
"serious consideration,"

41:15.208 --> 41:17.076
But they'll never hire you
as chief in a million years,

41:17.110 --> 41:19.378
So, really,
it's perfect for me.

41:19.412 --> 41:20.579
Is that so?

41:20.613 --> 41:22.981
What makes you so certain
I won't get it?

41:23.016 --> 41:24.449
Brenda, please, you...

41:24.484 --> 41:26.318
You can't even control
your own officers.

41:26.352 --> 41:28.119
And Flynn and provenza
were outwitted

41:28.153 --> 41:29.487
By a couple of stewardesses.

41:29.521 --> 41:31.155
Flight attendants.
And they weren't outwitted.

41:31.189 --> 41:32.656
Really?

41:32.691 --> 41:34.458
Where are they now?

41:36.361 --> 41:38.528
You know, maybe if
you hadn't called them

41:38.563 --> 41:39.863
A couple of skanks,

41:39.897 --> 41:41.731
They would have told us
where they parked your car.

41:41.766 --> 41:43.066
I'm just saying.

41:43.100 --> 41:44.934
Do you think it's possible
for you to shut up?!

41:44.968 --> 41:46.101
Look to the left.

41:46.136 --> 41:47.603
I'll look to the right.

41:47.637 --> 41:49.904
Hey, I'm not the one who started
talking to these two broads!

41:49.938 --> 41:52.506
Oh, you're the one that picked
them up on that plane!

41:52.541 --> 41:54.373
Oh, no, I was not!
What, are you kidding me?

41:54.408 --> 41:57.704
Oh, every woman you see,
you got to go try to pick up!
