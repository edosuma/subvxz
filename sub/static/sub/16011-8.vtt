WEBVTT

00:03.240 --> 00:04.600
"I am Mia."

00:06.000 --> 00:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:54.640 --> 01:56.400
You must be Mia.

01:56.401 --> 01:58.160
I am Madame Lacie.

01:58.200 --> 01:59.540
Please have a seat so we may

01:59.541 --> 02:00.880
proceed with our first lesson.

02:04.160 --> 02:06.200
She's 45 seconds late, Madame.

02:06.240 --> 02:07.840
Right you are, Violetta.

02:07.880 --> 02:09.376
- Although it's not
- considered polite

02:09.400 --> 02:11.960
To point out one's shortcomings.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.120
Yes, Madame.

02:14.160 --> 02:16.096
- [lowers voice] After all,
- I don't have all day.

02:16.120 --> 02:17.600
Leave me alone.

02:17.640 --> 02:19.480
Sitting in a correct manner

02:19.520 --> 02:21.220
is an important aspect

02:21.221 --> 02:22.920
of our everyday appearance...

02:22.960 --> 02:24.600
What are you doing here, anyway?

02:24.640 --> 02:26.440
This is class for young ladies,

02:26.480 --> 02:28.960
not commoners with no style.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.120
- Maybe I'm hoping that
- some of your grace and poise

02:31.160 --> 02:33.280
Will rub off on me.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.400
Fat chance.

02:34.440 --> 02:35.720
Now remember,

02:35.760 --> 02:37.560
a young lady must be impeccable

02:37.600 --> 02:39.560
in all of her actions.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.480
- That is why I would be
- judging you on each

02:41.520 --> 02:42.660
And every one of

02:42.661 --> 02:43.800
your lessons today.

02:43.840 --> 02:45.880
So be at your very best!

02:45.920 --> 02:47.400
Mmm... now, Mia. That's no way

02:47.401 --> 02:48.880
for a young lady to sit!

02:48.920 --> 02:51.880
Straighten that spine!

02:51.920 --> 02:53.380
Like Violetta here.

02:53.381 --> 02:54.840
Perfect, dearie.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.080
Hmmm.

02:56.120 --> 02:57.160
[clicks tongue]

03:02.000 --> 03:03.240
Good.

03:05.360 --> 03:06.940
Memorize this formal

03:06.941 --> 03:08.520
table setting diagram.

03:10.320 --> 03:11.840
You have five minutes

03:11.841 --> 03:13.360
to recreate that diagram.

03:13.400 --> 03:15.300
And remember: Blades facing

03:15.301 --> 03:17.200
the centre of the plate.

03:17.240 --> 03:19.720
Always facing the centre.

03:19.760 --> 03:21.880
- [Violetta] I learned to do this
- the hard way.

03:21.920 --> 03:23.340
One time,

03:23.341 --> 03:24.760
our maid got salmonella.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.300
We had no help

03:26.301 --> 03:27.800
for an entire week!

03:27.840 --> 03:29.640
Ugh.

03:29.680 --> 03:31.800
I'm sure you can't relate.

03:31.840 --> 03:33.740
True. It's hard to relate

03:33.741 --> 03:35.640
to someone so spoiled.

03:35.680 --> 03:37.980
Not bad, if we were serving

03:37.981 --> 03:40.280
only four courses today.

03:40.320 --> 03:41.600
[Mme. Lacie] That's a dessert

03:41.601 --> 03:42.880
fork, not a salad fork.

03:42.920 --> 03:45.160
Soup spoon on the right, please!

03:45.200 --> 03:46.600
Psht. Don't be jealous

03:46.601 --> 03:48.000
just because you're poor!

03:49.440 --> 03:50.640
What makes you think that?

03:50.680 --> 03:52.600
Well, for one thing...

03:52.640 --> 03:54.320
you... wear the same clothes

03:54.321 --> 03:56.000
every day.

03:56.040 --> 03:57.800
- [chuckles] It's
- a school uniform.

03:57.840 --> 03:59.120
Everyone wears it every day.

04:00.640 --> 04:01.660
- Madame! Madame!

04:01.661 --> 04:02.680
- Yes, Violetta?

04:04.520 --> 04:05.960
Mia's contradicting me

04:05.961 --> 04:07.400
and insulting my intelligence.

04:07.440 --> 04:09.600
- [Mme. Lacie] Mia, you should
- know better than that.

04:09.640 --> 04:11.220
Young ladies are pleasant.

04:11.221 --> 04:12.800
They do not argue.

04:12.840 --> 04:14.260
You're right, Madame.

04:14.261 --> 04:15.680
Can I use the bathroom?

04:15.720 --> 04:17.640
The what-room?

04:17.680 --> 04:20.200
The... washroom?

04:20.240 --> 04:21.940
A civilized person

04:21.940 --> 04:23.640
refers to it as a "restroom,"

04:23.680 --> 04:25.180
a "powder room"

04:25.181 --> 04:26.680
or simply "the facilities."

04:26.720 --> 04:27.720
- And yes, you may.

04:27.721 --> 04:28.721
- Thanks.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.680
But, Mia your table arrangement

04:30.681 --> 04:32.600
needs some work.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.320
Violetta, perfect.

05:06.920 --> 05:10.520
Hi Mia. Say your password.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.800
"Peering earthward, never up.

05:12.840 --> 05:14.760
- Where butter's
- held within a cup."

05:25.840 --> 05:28.960
[screams]

05:31.680 --> 05:35.120
Waaahhhhhhhh!

05:35.160 --> 05:36.640
Ugh!

05:36.680 --> 05:38.280
Aaw!

05:38.320 --> 05:39.320
[Yuko] Good work!

05:39.321 --> 05:40.321
That's almost perfect!

05:40.360 --> 05:42.360
Really?! Thanks.

05:42.400 --> 05:43.420
I was starting to think

05:43.421 --> 05:44.440
I'd never get it.

05:44.480 --> 05:46.960
[laughs] Not you, Mia. Onchao!

05:47.000 --> 05:49.400
Good boy. You're a natural.

05:52.880 --> 05:54.660
Wow, Onchao. At least one of us

05:54.661 --> 05:56.440
is getting the hang of flying!

05:57.360 --> 05:58.680
Where's Mo?

05:58.720 --> 06:00.320
He's hiding.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.280
- Queen Mayla
- wants him for one of her...

06:02.320 --> 06:04.400
"Royal Protocol" lessons.

06:04.440 --> 06:06.360
Eww! Like an etiquette class?

06:07.480 --> 06:09.320
I know what that's like.

06:09.360 --> 06:10.480
I bet he thinks I'll tell

06:10.481 --> 06:11.600
the Queen where he is...

06:11.640 --> 06:13.760
Which I totally will.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.120
I'll help you find him.

06:15.121 --> 06:16.440
Mo in an etiquette class?

06:16.480 --> 06:18.160
- Now that is something
- I have to see.

06:18.200 --> 06:19.400
DING!

06:19.440 --> 06:20.560
Mo!

06:41.840 --> 06:43.100
Where'd it go?

06:43.101 --> 06:44.360
It was right in front of us!

06:44.400 --> 06:45.880
What was right in front of you?

06:45.920 --> 06:47.960
Um... you, your majesty.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.240
Apparently.

06:49.280 --> 06:52.280
Mmmm... Have you seen Mo?

06:52.320 --> 06:53.720
- Nope, sorry...

06:53.721 --> 06:55.120
- Can't help you there.

06:55.160 --> 06:57.800
Really? Pity.

06:57.840 --> 06:59.740
He's supposed to be

06:59.741 --> 07:01.640
in his Royal Protocol Session.

07:01.680 --> 07:03.380
He has to learn how to

07:03.381 --> 07:05.080
sip tea without slurping,

07:05.120 --> 07:07.140
and bow, and not fidget

07:07.141 --> 07:09.160
during a speech.

07:09.200 --> 07:11.480
It's important that a prince...

07:11.520 --> 07:12.980
- Ow!

07:12.981 --> 07:14.440
- should be well mannered.

07:14.480 --> 07:16.360
Ogh... I mean... Oh hi!

07:16.400 --> 07:17.840
You don't think I was hiding...

07:17.841 --> 07:19.280
do you?

07:22.440 --> 07:24.040
- [laughing]
- [Mo sighs]

07:24.080 --> 07:25.960
Now that you're done not hiding,

07:26.000 --> 07:27.220
let's begin your

07:27.221 --> 07:28.440
Royal Protocol session.

07:28.480 --> 07:30.180
Mia! Don't you have an oracle

07:30.181 --> 07:31.880
that needs solving?

07:31.920 --> 07:33.080
[whispers] Please?

07:33.120 --> 07:34.680
[Mia] It can wait, Mo.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.680
- Etiquette
- is also very important.

07:36.720 --> 07:38.520
Not as important as the oracle.

07:38.560 --> 07:40.680
Sorry, mom, duty calls!

07:40.720 --> 07:42.300
Maybe I can help.

07:42.301 --> 07:43.880
What's the oracle?

07:45.120 --> 07:47.040
"Peering Earthward, never up;

07:47.080 --> 07:48.880
- Where butter's held
- within a cup."

07:50.120 --> 07:51.960
See? Very tricky!

07:52.000 --> 07:53.260
Gonna take us hours

07:53.261 --> 07:54.520
to figure this one out.

07:54.560 --> 07:56.600
Sorry, mom!

07:56.640 --> 07:58.240
It won't take hours.

07:58.241 --> 07:59.840
I already know the answer.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.760
- And after I show you
- where it is,

08:01.800 --> 08:03.940
We'll still have plenty of time

08:03.941 --> 08:06.080
for Mo's protocol session.

08:06.120 --> 08:08.120
Well... aren't you coming?

08:09.080 --> 08:10.480
[laugh]

08:26.760 --> 08:28.800
My Queen, I have

08:28.801 --> 08:30.840
very interesting news.

08:30.880 --> 08:32.600
Silence!

08:32.640 --> 08:34.640
Can't you see I'm busy?

08:41.360 --> 08:42.720
[purrs]

08:45.080 --> 08:46.720
[meows]

08:46.760 --> 08:48.100
But it's about a uni...

08:48.101 --> 08:49.440
[cat screeches] AAGH!

08:49.480 --> 08:52.480
Gargona! I need peace and quiet!

08:52.520 --> 08:55.200
I'm collecting my thoughts.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.120
[purring]

09:06.640 --> 09:07.880
[screeches]

09:07.920 --> 09:09.000
Gargona!

09:09.040 --> 09:10.480
[meows, frightened]

09:10.520 --> 09:12.600
What have you done to my Ziggo?

09:12.640 --> 09:14.960
Get out! Get out of my castle!

09:15.000 --> 09:17.420
My poor baby. What did that

09:17.421 --> 09:19.840
horrible Gargona do to you?

09:19.880 --> 09:20.920
[whistles]

09:23.760 --> 09:26.000
If you EVER touch my cat again,

09:26.040 --> 09:27.880
- you'll be shovelling
- dragon droppings

09:27.920 --> 09:30.040
For the rest of the millennium.

09:30.080 --> 09:31.960
Now get out of my sight!

09:38.160 --> 09:39.200
[screeches]

09:41.520 --> 09:43.300
She doesn't want to hear

09:43.301 --> 09:45.080
about the golden-horned unicorn.

09:45.120 --> 09:46.780
Fine. I'll just

09:46.781 --> 09:48.440
capture it myself,

09:48.480 --> 09:51.240
and she'll beg me for it.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.280
[Mayla] Here we are...

09:57.281 --> 09:58.840
The Hanging Gardens.

09:58.880 --> 10:00.520
Woooow!

10:03.440 --> 10:05.180
[inhaling deeply] Aah! Isn't

10:05.181 --> 10:06.920
that smell intoxicating?

10:06.960 --> 10:08.200
[giggles]

10:10.720 --> 10:12.040
[Mo laughs]

10:12.080 --> 10:13.240
Yaaa!

10:15.360 --> 10:17.000
[sniffs and snorts]

10:19.200 --> 10:21.000
If the Trumptus piece is here,

10:21.040 --> 10:22.400
these smells might be too strong

10:22.401 --> 10:23.760
for Onchao to find it.

10:25.680 --> 10:27.760
Tell us the oracle again, Mia.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.880
"Peering earthward, never up;

10:29.920 --> 10:31.080
where butter's held

10:31.081 --> 10:32.240
within a cup."

10:32.280 --> 10:33.640
Wait a minute! It isn't us!

10:33.641 --> 10:35.000
It's the flowers!

10:35.040 --> 10:36.800
We don't look earthwards,

10:36.801 --> 10:38.560
the flowers do. See!

10:39.680 --> 10:40.880
[neighs]

10:43.360 --> 10:44.840
[sniffs]

10:44.880 --> 10:45.920
[neighs]

10:47.160 --> 10:48.200
[sniffs]

10:50.400 --> 10:51.600
Woooow!

10:57.960 --> 10:59.580
Um... we better take this back

10:59.581 --> 11:01.200
to show Father.

11:01.240 --> 11:02.880
Right away!

11:02.920 --> 11:04.800
Ah! You're conveniently

11:04.801 --> 11:06.680
forgetting something.

11:06.720 --> 11:07.760
Ouu..

11:09.360 --> 11:11.160
- Now then.
- Lesson one:

11:11.200 --> 11:13.520
The kingly stride.

11:13.560 --> 11:15.340
Walk with me

11:15.341 --> 11:17.120
and don't bob your head!

11:17.160 --> 11:18.600
[whispers] Help me!

11:18.640 --> 11:19.920
[laugh]

11:29.760 --> 11:32.280
Can we eat now? I'm starving.

11:32.320 --> 11:34.440
Well then, elf etiquette holds

11:34.480 --> 11:35.760
that you should

11:35.761 --> 11:37.040
serve your friends first.

11:37.080 --> 11:38.320
Ooww..

11:39.200 --> 11:40.400
Thank you.

11:40.440 --> 11:41.640
[giggles]

11:41.680 --> 11:43.240
[mocking] Oh dear,

11:43.280 --> 11:45.200
- you seem to
- have forgotten the bread.

11:46.240 --> 11:48.200
- Hey!
- Oops.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.440
Mo, shame on you!

11:50.480 --> 11:51.600
That's okay.

11:51.601 --> 11:52.720
I'll get my own food.

11:53.920 --> 11:56.520
Yuko, I expect better from you.

11:56.560 --> 11:57.880
That's okay.

11:57.920 --> 11:59.220
Ouh!

11:59.221 --> 12:00.520
[laughs]

12:00.560 --> 12:02.800
[laughs] Hey!

12:02.840 --> 12:04.360
[laughing]

12:04.400 --> 12:06.560
- Ou!
- Ah! Don't throw that at me!

12:09.560 --> 12:11.920
[all laughing]

12:13.800 --> 12:15.620
Children!

12:15.621 --> 12:17.440
I think I'll collect herbs...

12:17.480 --> 12:19.480
while this gets cleaned up.

12:25.800 --> 12:27.320
[laugh]

12:27.360 --> 12:28.360
- Ou!

12:28.361 --> 12:29.361
- Hey!

12:29.400 --> 12:31.200
[Mo] Don't throw that at me!

12:31.240 --> 12:32.960
[all] Hahaha!

12:34.560 --> 12:37.760
Okay! Okay! Truce.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.540
Uh oh. How are you guys

12:39.541 --> 12:41.280
gonna clean this up?

12:41.320 --> 12:43.440
Us?! You started it!

12:43.480 --> 12:45.680
Okay... watch this.

12:49.080 --> 12:50.500
Wow! Water glares

12:50.501 --> 12:51.920
work pretty well!

12:59.240 --> 13:00.880
Hey Yuko.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.520
Bet I can hit that tree stump.

13:02.560 --> 13:03.960
Bet I can hit it first.

13:07.160 --> 13:08.680
[laughing]

13:11.040 --> 13:12.520
[Panthea] Ziggo?

13:12.560 --> 13:14.640
Where are you my little beast?

13:14.680 --> 13:16.440
You can come out now.

13:16.480 --> 13:19.240
That horrible Gargona is gone.

13:19.280 --> 13:21.400
Ziggo? Ziggo,

13:21.401 --> 13:23.520
where are you? Ugh..

13:23.560 --> 13:26.160
Cough up a hairball! Anything!

13:26.200 --> 13:29.120
WHERE'S MY ZIGGO?

13:40.800 --> 13:42.420
Ah, there's my

13:42.421 --> 13:44.040
little golden unicorn.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.400
And there's those

13:47.401 --> 13:49.280
elves as usual.

13:49.320 --> 13:51.560
Always with the water!

13:55.680 --> 13:57.260
Who doesn't like

13:57.261 --> 13:58.840
a surprise guest at a picnic.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.640
[chuckles]

14:03.320 --> 14:04.360
Meow.

14:12.280 --> 14:13.600
Huh!

14:14.840 --> 14:16.040
[snarls]

14:16.080 --> 14:18.120
You!? Just what I need.

14:18.160 --> 14:20.240
Get lost you mangy flee bag!

14:21.920 --> 14:24.160
No. Wait. Don't go!

14:24.200 --> 14:26.240
Panthea will have my hide!

14:26.280 --> 14:28.200
- [fakingly sweet] Come here
- little kitty cat.

14:28.240 --> 14:30.280
I'm your friend.

14:30.320 --> 14:31.720
- Ugh!
- Meooww!

14:38.480 --> 14:40.800
Oh! Did you see that shot?

14:40.840 --> 14:42.040
- That was me!

14:42.041 --> 14:43.240
- Was not. Ask Mia!

14:43.280 --> 14:44.740
[Mia] Actually I think I was

14:44.741 --> 14:46.200
the one who made that shot!

14:47.520 --> 14:48.560
Meow...

14:51.080 --> 14:54.200
How perfect. A carrying case.

14:58.080 --> 15:00.040
Well, helloooo!

15:00.080 --> 15:01.640
I've been looking for you.

15:01.680 --> 15:02.760
[neighs]

15:02.800 --> 15:03.840
[gasp]

15:03.880 --> 15:04.920
[laughs maniacally]

15:04.960 --> 15:07.640
Onchao!

15:07.680 --> 15:08.900
I wouldn't try that

15:08.901 --> 15:10.120
if I were you.

15:10.160 --> 15:11.400
[neighs]

15:12.720 --> 15:14.240
It's okay, Onchao.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.560
That's far enough!

15:15.600 --> 15:17.120
Please don't hurt him!

15:17.160 --> 15:19.440
We'll do anything you want.

15:19.480 --> 15:21.140
Excellent.

15:21.141 --> 15:22.800
We understand each other.

15:24.560 --> 15:25.840
- Meow.
- [gasps]

15:27.000 --> 15:29.160
Hey, who brought the cat?

15:29.200 --> 15:30.500
Remember when we were

15:30.501 --> 15:31.800
in Panthea's palace?

15:31.840 --> 15:33.000
Didn't she have

15:33.001 --> 15:34.160
a cat kind of like that?

15:34.200 --> 15:35.920
[Gargona] No. You're wrong.

15:35.960 --> 15:37.680
That's just some other cat.

15:37.720 --> 15:39.240
Now give it to me!

15:39.960 --> 15:41.000
[growls]

15:42.200 --> 15:43.840
He sure hates you.

15:43.880 --> 15:45.600
Just like Panthea's cat.

15:48.680 --> 15:49.940
You have our unicorn,

15:49.941 --> 15:51.200
we have your cat.

15:51.240 --> 15:53.240
Maybe we can make a trade.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.200
Never.

15:55.240 --> 15:57.000
Yuko, should we tell Panthea

15:57.001 --> 15:58.760
right now that we have her cat,

15:58.800 --> 16:00.200
or wait a while and

16:00.201 --> 16:01.600
let her get really mad?

16:01.640 --> 16:03.920
Wait! No!

16:03.960 --> 16:05.480
Okay...

16:05.520 --> 16:07.240
I accept.

16:07.241 --> 16:08.960
The cat for the unicorn.

16:11.520 --> 16:12.560
[meows angrily]

16:13.320 --> 16:14.360
[gasps]

16:15.600 --> 16:16.840
Nice Kitty.

16:16.880 --> 16:17.960
[screeches]

16:18.000 --> 16:19.080
[all] Grab him!

16:19.120 --> 16:20.160
- Ugh!
- Ugh!

16:21.400 --> 16:22.800
Bring me that cat,

16:22.840 --> 16:24.240
or our deal is off!

16:25.560 --> 16:27.200
And no funny business

16:27.240 --> 16:28.600
or your little gold

16:28.601 --> 16:29.960
horned friend gets it!

16:35.720 --> 16:38.000
Here kitty kitty kitty!

16:38.040 --> 16:39.820
- Come on little kitty!

16:39.821 --> 16:41.600
- Come, little kitty!

16:41.640 --> 16:43.560
Here Kitty! Here kitty!

16:43.600 --> 16:45.200
[neighs]

16:45.240 --> 16:46.620
Stop pulling me!

16:46.621 --> 16:48.000
Where are you going!

16:50.120 --> 16:51.380
- [snorts]

16:51.381 --> 16:52.640
- He's in this tree?

16:52.680 --> 16:54.440
How do you know?

16:54.441 --> 16:56.200
Did the unicorn tell you?

16:56.240 --> 16:59.160
Yeah, like I can speak unicorn.

16:59.200 --> 17:01.160
- There he is!
- Meow...

17:01.200 --> 17:03.040
Get him down!

17:03.080 --> 17:04.599
I've got him.

17:04.640 --> 17:06.599
[chuckles] Animals love me.

17:06.640 --> 17:08.720
Here cat. Come to Mo!

17:08.760 --> 17:10.319
[snarls]

17:10.359 --> 17:11.520
[cat screeches]

17:11.521 --> 17:12.680
[Mo] Wow! Ow. [chuckles]

17:12.720 --> 17:14.760
Not all animals, I guess.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.640
He seemed to like you. You go!

17:17.680 --> 17:19.960
But... I can't fly.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.160
Then climb! Just get that cat.

17:23.200 --> 17:24.920
Or...

17:24.960 --> 17:26.560
It's okay, Onchao.

17:26.560 --> 17:28.160
This'll all be over in a minute.

17:30.320 --> 17:31.940
Be careful.

17:31.941 --> 17:33.560
It's a long way up.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.840
And a long way down.

17:42.200 --> 17:43.380
[Mia] Here kitty.

17:43.381 --> 17:44.560
Come here little fella.

17:44.600 --> 17:46.120
I won't hurt you.

17:46.121 --> 17:47.640
I promise. Mhmm!

17:47.680 --> 17:48.720
Please?

17:50.720 --> 17:53.560
Good boy. Just a little more.

17:53.600 --> 17:54.960
- Meoowww!

17:54.961 --> 17:56.320
- Whoaa!!! Help!!!

18:01.440 --> 18:02.720
This is an odd...

18:02.760 --> 18:04.240
[Mia] It's for our picnic.

18:04.280 --> 18:06.360
A royal candle holder.

18:06.400 --> 18:08.020
I don't know why,

18:08.021 --> 18:09.640
but you want this.

18:11.360 --> 18:13.200
[Mayla] Forgive my rudeness.

18:13.240 --> 18:14.700
We haven't properly

18:14.701 --> 18:16.160
welcomed you to our picnic.

18:16.200 --> 18:17.560
What???

18:17.600 --> 18:19.360
Royal protocol demands

18:19.400 --> 18:20.760
that you receive

18:20.761 --> 18:22.120
a bouquet of flowers.

18:22.160 --> 18:24.920
Don't they smell divine?

18:24.960 --> 18:27.360
AACHOO!

18:28.720 --> 18:30.520
Get... AACHOO!

18:31.960 --> 18:33.520
That... AACHOO!

18:33.560 --> 18:34.880
- Away... AACHOO!

18:34.881 --> 18:36.200
- [neighs]

18:38.560 --> 18:40.080
AAAATCHOO!

18:43.360 --> 18:44.960
Meow!

18:45.000 --> 18:46.840
You have your cat,

18:46.841 --> 18:48.680
we have our unicorn. Go.

18:48.720 --> 18:50.120
- Meaoowww!

18:50.121 --> 18:51.520
- Ow! little...!

18:51.560 --> 18:53.980
This isn't over.

18:53.981 --> 18:56.400
You haven't seen the last of me!

18:58.160 --> 18:59.640
You're welcome to join us

18:59.641 --> 19:01.120
for a picnic any time.

19:01.160 --> 19:02.320
[laugh]

19:08.720 --> 19:09.740
I told you everything

19:09.741 --> 19:10.760
would be okay.

19:10.800 --> 19:11.940
I won't let anything

19:11.941 --> 19:13.080
happen to you.

19:13.120 --> 19:14.900
You chased off Gargona without

19:14.901 --> 19:16.680
a water glare or anything.

19:16.720 --> 19:17.780
And got her to give up

19:17.781 --> 19:18.840
the Trumptus piece.

19:18.880 --> 19:20.360
That's my mom!

19:20.400 --> 19:21.680
[laughs]

19:21.720 --> 19:24.560
I mean, uh...

19:24.600 --> 19:26.420
Excellent, Mo.

19:26.421 --> 19:28.240
You remembered your protocol.

19:28.280 --> 19:30.200
Speaking of which,

19:30.201 --> 19:32.120
we haven't finished your lesson!

19:32.160 --> 19:33.740
Oh boy,

19:33.741 --> 19:35.320
look how late it's getting.

19:35.360 --> 19:36.680
We better get this piece of

19:36.681 --> 19:38.000
the Trumptus back to the palace

19:38.040 --> 19:39.160
before it gets dark!

19:42.920 --> 19:44.640
Aahhg..

19:44.680 --> 19:48.080
Now then, lesson ten: poise.

19:48.120 --> 19:50.400
Stop slouching! Hips straight!

19:51.520 --> 19:52.560
[laugh]

19:52.600 --> 19:53.640
[snorts]

19:57.680 --> 19:59.140
[Panthea] I don't care if you

19:59.141 --> 20:00.600
tear apart the whole castle.

20:00.640 --> 20:03.160
FIND MY ZIGGO!!

20:09.520 --> 20:10.840
Your Highness.

20:10.841 --> 20:12.160
I believe I have som...

20:12.200 --> 20:13.320
Meow...

20:14.720 --> 20:18.680
My precious baby.

20:18.720 --> 20:20.460
What did that

20:20.461 --> 20:22.200
horrible Gargona do to you?

20:22.240 --> 20:23.720
But my Queen, I...

20:23.760 --> 20:25.320
This is all your fault.

20:25.360 --> 20:27.320
- What have you to say
- in your defense?!

20:27.360 --> 20:29.000
Majesty, it is imperative

20:29.001 --> 20:30.640
that you listen to me.

20:32.280 --> 20:35.840
I have seen something amazing.

20:35.880 --> 20:37.600
[Gargona] A unicorn

20:37.601 --> 20:39.320
with a golden horn.

20:39.360 --> 20:41.080
And wings.

20:41.120 --> 20:42.920
It lives among the elves.

20:42.960 --> 20:44.480
And they protect it

20:44.481 --> 20:46.000
with their lives.

20:46.040 --> 20:47.960
This is a very special

20:47.961 --> 20:49.880
beast indeed.

20:51.560 --> 20:54.200
A golden horn?

20:54.240 --> 20:55.780
Can you imagine the power

20:55.781 --> 20:57.320
that could hold?

20:57.360 --> 21:00.920
I could be young forever.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.760
Capture it. Make that

21:02.761 --> 21:04.560
your number one priority.

21:04.600 --> 21:07.240
I want that unicorn.

21:15.720 --> 21:17.400
[giggles]

21:17.440 --> 21:20.280
Oh no! Not again!

21:20.320 --> 21:21.940
Sorry, Onchao.

21:21.941 --> 21:23.560
Keep practicing that flying!

21:23.600 --> 21:25.600
And stay with Yuko and Mo!

21:27.240 --> 21:28.560
[neighs]

21:33.520 --> 21:34.840
I hate coming back

21:34.841 --> 21:36.160
from Centopia.

21:36.200 --> 21:37.360
Especially to places

21:37.361 --> 21:38.520
like... this.

21:48.240 --> 21:50.100
Ah, just in time

21:50.101 --> 21:51.960
for your next lesson.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.240
Your most graceful walk,

21:54.241 --> 21:56.480
two ways, with a pivot.

21:56.520 --> 21:58.096
- Mia, I hope you're
- feeling refreshed.

21:58.120 --> 21:59.280
Yes, Madame.

22:20.520 --> 22:21.520
Say... is it considered

22:21.521 --> 22:22.521
"good etiquette"

22:22.560 --> 22:24.280
- to have salad stuck
- in your teeth?

22:31.840 --> 22:33.720
But it was all her fault!

22:33.760 --> 22:35.520
That... peasant!

22:35.560 --> 22:36.780
Violetta! That's no way

22:36.781 --> 22:38.000
for a young lady to talk!

22:38.040 --> 22:40.920
But... she... I...!

22:40.960 --> 22:42.960
[gasps] Going to the powder room

22:42.961 --> 22:44.960
without asking permission.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
Not very ladylike

22:46.001 --> 22:47.001
if you ask me.

22:47.040 --> 22:48.040
[laugh]
