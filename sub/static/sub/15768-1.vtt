01:00.600 --> 01:03.068
<i>[Winnie the Pooh theme song]</i>

01:09.920 --> 01:13.151
<i>[male narrator] This could be
the room of any small boy.</i>

01:13.240 --> 01:15.549
<i>But, in fact, it's not.</i>

01:15.640 --> 01:20.839
<i>It is the room of one young boy
in particular named Christopher Robin.</i>

01:20.920 --> 01:23.957
<i>Now, Christopher Robin
has a very active imagination,</i>

01:24.040 --> 01:27.510
<i>not to mention the uncanny ability
to collect things.</i>

01:27.600 --> 01:30.990
<i>Big things. Small things.
Sticky things.</i>

01:31.080 --> 01:34.755
<i>But his favourite things
are his stuffed animals.</i>

01:34.840 --> 01:37.035
<i>Ah! There they are now.</i>

01:37.120 --> 01:41.193
<i>A charming and eccentric
cast of characters.</i>

01:41.280 --> 01:46.149
<i>And his best friend among them
is a bear named Winnie the Pooh.</i>

01:46.240 --> 01:48.708
<i>Or Pooh for short.</i>

01:48.800 --> 01:52.475
<i>Together they had many
unusual adventures,</i>

01:52.560 --> 01:56.678
<i>that all happened right here
in the Hundred Acre Wood.</i>

01:58.440 --> 02:02.592
<i># Deep in the Hundred Acre Wood</i>

02:02.680 --> 02:07.390
<i># Where Christopher Robin plays</i>

02:07.480 --> 02:12.315
<i># You'll find the enchanted
neighbourhood</i>

02:12.400 --> 02:17.520
<i># Of Christopher's childhood days</i>

02:17.600 --> 02:21.275
<i># A donkey named Eeyore is his friend</i>

02:21.800 --> 02:25.509
<i># And Kanga and little Roo
and Tigger, too</i>

02:25.640 --> 02:30.191
<i># There's Rabbit and Piglet
and there's Owl</i>

02:30.280 --> 02:33.238
<i># But most of all Winnie the Pooh</i>

02:34.960 --> 02:37.793
<i># Winnie the Pooh
Winnie the Pooh</i>

02:37.880 --> 02:40.474
<i># Tubby little cubby

02:59.880 --> 03:01.199
<i>[narrator] Chapter one,</i>

03:01.280 --> 03:06.070
<i>in which Winnie the Pooh
has a very important thing to do.</i>

03:06.160 --> 03:09.072
<i>As the sun rose over
the Hundred Acre Wood,</i>

03:09.160 --> 03:13.392
<i>Pooh leapt out of bed and greeted
the day with much enthusiasm.</i>

03:13.480 --> 03:14.993
[snoring] Ooh...

03:16.480 --> 03:19.392
<i>- Honey.
- [narrator] Uh, Pooh?</i>

03:19.480 --> 03:22.552
[stammers] More honey, please.

03:22.640 --> 03:24.198
[humming]

03:24.280 --> 03:25.793
<i>I say, Pooh?</i>

03:26.960 --> 03:29.110
<i>- [continues snoring]
- [clears throat] Pooh?</i>

03:30.600 --> 03:32.431
<i>Oh, do wake up.</i>

03:33.640 --> 03:35.119
<i>- Pooh!
- [Pooh] Oh!</i>

03:38.200 --> 03:43.194
Oh, bother. I was having
the most wonderful dream.

03:43.280 --> 03:45.510
<i>Yes, but it's time to wake up.</i>

03:45.600 --> 03:49.434
<i>You have a very important thing
to do today.</i>

03:49.520 --> 03:52.830
<i>- Like what?
- [chuckles] Well, if I told you that,</i>

03:52.920 --> 03:55.275
<i>I'd ruin the rest of the story,
wouldn't I?</i>

03:55.360 --> 03:58.033
- [tummy rumbles]
- [giggles]

03:58.120 --> 03:59.519
Of course.

03:59.600 --> 04:04.037
What could be more important
than a little something to eat?

04:05.520 --> 04:08.910
Or perhaps a little larger something.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.312
Oh, not to worry, tummy.
I always know what to do.

04:13.400 --> 04:16.551
<i># A Pooh Bear takes care of his tummy</i>

04:16.640 --> 04:19.916
<i># He fills it with things that are sweet</i>

04:20.000 --> 04:23.276
<i># A Pooh Bear takes care of his tummy</i>

04:23.360 --> 04:26.670
<i>- # By never forgetting to eat

04:26.760 --> 04:32.073
<i># When it is growly and glummy
a search for the honey is on</i>

04:32.600 --> 04:35.478
<i># The Pooh has a knack
for finding a snack</i>

04:35.560 --> 04:38.518
<i># Unless all the honey is...</i>

04:38.600 --> 04:39.953
Gone?

04:40.040 --> 04:42.076
[tummy rumbling in tune]

04:42.160 --> 04:44.594
<i># A Pooh Bear takes care of his tummy</i>

04:44.680 --> 04:46.477
<i># No need for the tummy to fret</i>

04:47.080 --> 04:49.230
<i># A Pooh Bear takes care of his tummy</i>

04:49.320 --> 04:51.356
<i># He knows what his tummy must get</i>

04:51.800 --> 04:53.995
<i># Don't worry, my round little chummy</i>

04:54.080 --> 04:56.310
<i># I'm hearing your ravenous plea</i>

<i># Wherever the honey will be</i>

05:01.080 --> 05:03.355
<i># My friends are out there
with honey to spare</i>

05:03.440 --> 05:08.468
<i># And they will take care
of my tummy and me #</i>

05:12.800 --> 05:14.916
- Bother.
- [Eeyore groans]

05:15.000 --> 05:17.639
[gasps] I know that sigh.

05:18.880 --> 05:21.030
Good morning, Eeyore.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.111
Lovely day, isn't it?

05:23.200 --> 05:26.556
Wish I could say yes, but I can't.

05:26.640 --> 05:27.834
Oh my, Eeyore.

05:27.920 --> 05:31.595
You wouldn't happen to have any honey
lying about, would you?

05:31.680 --> 05:35.434
- You see, I seem to have run out.
- [tummy continues to rumble]

05:35.520 --> 05:37.829
Oh, yes. Good idea, tummy.

05:37.920 --> 05:40.718
Perhaps I should look in back.

05:41.680 --> 05:45.468
Bother. No honey in here, either.

05:45.560 --> 05:46.913
What?

05:47.000 --> 05:50.470
Eeyore, what has happened to your tail?

05:50.560 --> 05:52.596
- What has happened to it?
- Well...

05:53.880 --> 05:56.030
...it isn't there.

05:56.800 --> 06:00.679
That accounts for a good deal.
That explains everything.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.512
No wonder.

06:03.120 --> 06:04.109
[sighs]

06:04.680 --> 06:07.990
Oh! There it is.
I'd recognize it anywhere.

06:08.080 --> 06:09.911
The very tree where I was hatched.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.070
I remember the day
Mother made these marks,

06:12.160 --> 06:16.438
her giant meaty claw carving furrows
in the crumbly bark.

06:16.520 --> 06:19.273
Chapter one, the birth of a genius.

06:19.360 --> 06:21.237
Pardon me, Owl.
What are you doing?

06:21.320 --> 06:23.788
Hmm? Oh, hello, Pooh. Eeyore.

06:23.880 --> 06:27.031
Why, I'm penning my personal memoirs.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.429
[chuckling] Yes. Now, where was I?

06:29.520 --> 06:31.636
Oh, yes, of course.
With steely nerve...

06:31.720 --> 06:35.235
Perhaps you could take a short break
from your important work

06:35.320 --> 06:38.118
and help us find Eeyore's tail?

06:38.200 --> 06:40.589
...and I rocketed towards Eeyore's tail!

06:40.680 --> 06:42.352
Eeyore's tail?

06:42.440 --> 06:43.759
What's wrong with Eeyore's tail?

06:43.840 --> 06:45.592
Well, it isn't there.

06:45.680 --> 06:47.557
Yes. So I see.

06:47.640 --> 06:49.198
Won't you help us, Owl?

06:49.280 --> 06:53.558
You have such a talent for speaking
and telling us what to do.

06:53.640 --> 06:57.428
Oh, thank you, Pooh. Yes, I do, don't I?
I didn't think anyone noticed.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.829
All right, take this.
Write this down carefully.

06:59.920 --> 07:03.629
Now, the customary procedure
in such cases is as follows.

07:03.720 --> 07:05.039
[Pooh, interrupting Owl]
Excuse me, Owl,

07:05.120 --> 07:09.830
but what does
"Crustimoney Proseedcake" mean?

07:09.920 --> 07:14.755
For I am a bear of very little brain
and long words bother me.

07:14.840 --> 07:17.115
It means "the thing to do."

07:17.200 --> 07:20.431
Oh. Well, as long as it means that,
I don't mind.

07:20.520 --> 07:22.750
- [sighs]
- [coughs]

07:22.840 --> 07:26.389
All right. Yes, well,
the thing to do is as follows:

07:26.480 --> 07:27.879
First, issue a reward to the...

07:27.960 --> 07:30.076
- [Pooh] Gesundheit.
- I beg your pardon?

07:30.160 --> 07:32.833
Well, you sneezed
just as you were going to tell me

07:32.920 --> 07:35.354
what the first thing to do was.

07:35.440 --> 07:36.998
I didn't sneeze.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.433
No, you did, Owl.

07:40.520 --> 07:43.398
No, I didn't. You can't sneeze
without knowing it.

07:43.480 --> 07:47.439
Well, you can't know it without
something having been sneezed.

07:49.480 --> 07:50.595
As I was saying,

07:50.680 --> 07:53.638
- first, issue a reward.
- [Pooh whispers] He's doing it again.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.790
You must be catching a cold.

07:55.880 --> 07:58.110
I'll probably catch it, too.

07:58.200 --> 08:01.988
No, no, no!
I'm not catching a cold.

08:02.080 --> 08:05.072
The word is "issue," not "achoo",

08:05.160 --> 08:06.798
and "achoo" isn't even a word.

08:06.880 --> 08:08.916
It's just a sort of sneezy sound
like achoo!

08:09.000 --> 08:10.718
[Pooh] Perhaps you should lie down, Owl?

08:10.800 --> 08:13.758
- Oh!
- My throat feels a little scratchy.

08:13.840 --> 08:16.115
Open wide, please.

08:16.920 --> 08:18.319
Ahh.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.038
Just as I suspected.

08:20.120 --> 08:23.192
Owl, we need honey.

08:23.280 --> 08:25.840
Enough of this infernal folderol!

08:25.920 --> 08:29.435
Look, the thing to do is,
we write a notice

08:29.520 --> 08:31.988
promising a large something

08:32.080 --> 08:36.357
to anyone who finds
a replacement tail for Eeyore!

08:36.440 --> 08:37.668
Is that clear?

08:37.760 --> 08:41.469
That sounds like a wonderful plan, Owl.

08:41.960 --> 08:45.509
Excellent. Now, we shall get Christopher
Robin to write out the notices,

08:45.600 --> 08:48.194
and we'll put them up
all over the forest.

08:51.800 --> 08:52.869
Here you are, Pooh.

08:54.840 --> 08:56.956
Oh, and make sure
everyone can see them.

08:57.040 --> 08:58.837
Oh, I will, Christopher.

08:58.920 --> 09:02.469
<i># Come one, come two, come all
Everyone heed the call</i>

09:02.560 --> 09:05.836
<i># There's a very important thing to do</i>

09:07.040 --> 09:08.758
<i># Drop what you're doing and come</i>

09:08.840 --> 09:10.239
<i># Bumpity-bumpity-bum</i>

09:10.320 --> 09:13.392
<i># There's a very important thing to do</i>

09:14.440 --> 09:18.319
<i># It's time to gather 'round
The work has just begun</i>

09:18.400 --> 09:20.470
<i># And when it's done
then you'll have found</i>

09:20.560 --> 09:21.834
<i># That you have had some fun</i>

09:21.920 --> 09:24.309
<i># With a monumentuous, consequentuous</i>

09:24.400 --> 09:27.073
<i># Very important thing to do #</i>

09:28.800 --> 09:29.789
[grunts]

09:32.600 --> 09:33.919
There we are.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.230
And now, I shall return to...

09:36.320 --> 09:37.594
Oh!

09:37.680 --> 09:39.636
Hello, B'loon.

09:39.720 --> 09:42.678
We have a very important
thing to do today.

09:42.760 --> 09:44.079
- Oh, yes.
- [low growling]

09:44.160 --> 09:45.912
Perhaps you'd like to join us?

09:46.000 --> 09:50.073
- Poor Eeyore. He's lost his tail.
- [shouting]

09:50.160 --> 09:53.038
Consider yourself pounced.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.194
That was a close call there, Pooh Bear.

09:56.280 --> 09:58.271
This guy... and I'm talking to you...

09:58.360 --> 10:00.271
...he was sneaking up on ya.

10:00.360 --> 10:01.349
Whoo! Oh!

10:01.440 --> 10:04.034
A slippery little devil, eh?
Get back here!

10:04.120 --> 10:07.669
Oh, no, you don't. Come here.
Whoo!

10:09.280 --> 10:11.919
Well, I must have scared him off.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.752
Um... Tigger?

10:13.840 --> 10:15.637
Yes, my good man?

10:16.760 --> 10:18.352
[stammers]

10:18.440 --> 10:19.509
Why, you.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.511
Here, take some of that!
What is this?

10:21.600 --> 10:25.149
Oh, really? Sticking to me now.
[shouts]

10:25.240 --> 10:29.279
This isn't working out the way
I was hoping. Make him go away.

10:29.360 --> 10:30.475
Oh, dear.

10:30.560 --> 10:32.198
[sobs] Get him off of me!

10:34.840 --> 10:36.512
Is he still there?

10:36.600 --> 10:38.989
Oh, yes. He's still here.

10:39.080 --> 10:41.594
And I think he wants to stick with you.

10:41.680 --> 10:42.715
What?

10:43.360 --> 10:46.193
I never thought of having
a sidekick before.

10:46.280 --> 10:51.559
I got to admit, he is a handsome devil.
Look at the chin on this kid.

10:51.640 --> 10:55.155
No, no. I can't do it, I tell you.
It's too risky.

10:55.240 --> 10:57.913
Why, if something were to happen
to this little guy,

10:58.000 --> 11:00.958
I just couldn't live with myself.

11:01.040 --> 11:05.875
It's a dangerous path I bounce.
But I bounce it alone.

11:05.960 --> 11:09.191
Because the Hundred Acre Wood
needs a hero, Pooh Bear,

11:09.280 --> 11:11.999
and I'm the only one.

11:13.120 --> 11:15.111
<i># Oh, I'm bouncy,
trouncy, flouncy, pouncy</i>

11:15.200 --> 11:16.269
<i># Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun!</i>

11:16.360 --> 11:17.679
<i># But the most wonderful thing
about Tiggers is</i>

11:17.760 --> 11:20.479
<i># I'm the only one
I'm the only one! #</i>

11:20.560 --> 11:21.913
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

11:22.000 --> 11:23.194
[chattering]

11:23.280 --> 11:25.430
Attention, please. Attention.

11:25.520 --> 11:29.195
Something tragic has befallen
a member of our community.

11:29.280 --> 11:33.159
- [all gasp]
- I present to you: Exhibit A.

11:35.120 --> 11:36.917
Oh! That is tragic.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.753
What? Oh, no, no, no.

11:39.840 --> 11:41.956
Eeyore, will you turn around, please?

11:42.040 --> 11:43.712
Oops, sorry.

11:43.800 --> 11:47.588
Our dear friend Eeyore
has lost his tail.

11:47.680 --> 11:48.669
Oh, dear.

11:50.040 --> 11:52.554
We mustn't leave him in this condition.

11:52.640 --> 11:57.156
So, we will have a contest
to find a new tail for Eeyore.

11:57.240 --> 12:00.630
[clears throat] I do say, Christopher
Robin, the winners of such contest

12:00.720 --> 12:04.759
are traditionally awarded
some form of remuneration.

12:05.600 --> 12:09.673
What is a "remooner"...
Moonyour... A renew...

12:09.760 --> 12:12.194
What are we renumbering?

12:12.280 --> 12:14.714
I don't know, Pooh,
but it sounds like a good thing.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.870
Oh, yes, it is a good thing, Piglet.

12:16.960 --> 12:19.633
It's a prize. But what shall it be?

12:19.720 --> 12:22.359
How about something great,
like a firecracker!

12:22.440 --> 12:24.032
Oh, gracious, no.

12:24.120 --> 12:26.475
How about something nice,
like a warm hug?

12:26.560 --> 12:28.471
Pruning shears.
I need pruning shears.

12:28.560 --> 12:32.633
I'd say thistles,
but nobody listens to me, anyway.

12:32.720 --> 12:38.716
Oh, Christopher Robin, I was hoping
for something a bit... sweeter?

12:39.840 --> 12:43.037
Why, Pooh, that's a grand idea.

12:43.600 --> 12:47.275
The prize for a new tail shall be...
a pot of honey.

12:47.360 --> 12:48.713
[all cheer] Hooray!

12:49.840 --> 12:52.400
<i>[narrator] As the others
searched for a tail,</i>

12:52.480 --> 12:57.235
<i>Pooh realized that a pine cone
would not win him the honey.</i>

12:57.320 --> 12:58.309
Why not?

12:58.400 --> 13:01.153
<i>Because it would have to be
something special.</i>

13:01.240 --> 13:05.472
Oh. Special, you say. Special.

13:05.560 --> 13:07.391
Think, think, think.

13:07.480 --> 13:09.948
<i>No hurry, Pooh.
Just take your time.</i>

13:10.040 --> 13:14.272
Take my time.
What a wonderful idea.

13:15.320 --> 13:16.799
Cuckoo, cuckoo.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.440
- Thanks, Pooh.
- Congratulations.

13:19.520 --> 13:21.431
You've won the contest.

13:21.520 --> 13:23.556

13:32.920 --> 13:34.558
[crashing]

13:35.360 --> 13:38.750
I knew it was too good to be true.

13:38.840 --> 13:40.592
Oh, dear.

13:40.680 --> 13:42.591
Well, rules are rules.
So sorry, Pooh.

13:43.760 --> 13:47.469
Excuse me.
We could give B'loon a try!

13:47.560 --> 13:50.950
- Whoa! [giggles]
- How clever, Piglet.

13:51.040 --> 13:52.792
What do you think, Eeyore?

13:52.880 --> 13:56.998
Sure is a cheerful colour.
Guess I'll have to get used to it.

13:57.080 --> 14:00.277
<i># It's Piglet
It's Piglet</i>

14:00.360 --> 14:02.271

14:02.360 --> 14:04.032
<i># Takes the prize fair and square</i>

14:04.120 --> 14:05.678
I'm still a bit up in the air.

14:05.760 --> 14:09.309
<i># You get the honey

14:09.400 --> 14:12.676
Hmm. This may not work after all.

14:15.160 --> 14:16.479
[sighs]

14:16.560 --> 14:19.233
<i>[narrator] And so they tried
a great many things.</i>

14:20.280 --> 14:21.269
<i>They tried...</i>

14:23.280 --> 14:24.474
<i>...and they tried...</i>

14:26.160 --> 14:27.434
<i>...and they tried...</i>

14:28.840 --> 14:32.719
<i>...and they tried, and they tried
and tried, and they tried...</i>

14:34.200 --> 14:35.599
<i>...until...</i>

14:35.680 --> 14:37.511
[accordion makes sombre music]

14:37.600 --> 14:40.990
<i>...they had run out of things to try.</i>

14:41.080 --> 14:44.789
It's OK.
I'll learn to live without it.

14:44.880 --> 14:47.110
Poor dear.

14:49.240 --> 14:51.800
You know, I may have just the thing.

14:51.880 --> 14:53.233
Up, up, up you go.

14:53.320 --> 14:54.833
[humming]

14:54.920 --> 14:56.319
There you are.

14:56.400 --> 15:01.633
It's an awful nice tail, Kanga.
Much nicer than the rest of me.

15:01.720 --> 15:03.676
<i># It's Kanga</i>

15:03.760 --> 15:07.230
No! No, no, no, no.
How about we celebrate with silence?

15:07.320 --> 15:09.356
<i># Enjoy #</i>

15:09.440 --> 15:10.634
Oh, bother.

15:11.640 --> 15:14.438
My tummy is feeling
a little 11 o'clock-ish.

15:14.520 --> 15:16.909
Do you still tell the time,
clock friend?

15:17.000 --> 15:20.709
I can't tell by the expression
on your face.

15:22.840 --> 15:26.674
<i>[narrator] Pooh left feeling unsatisfied
and a little out of sorts.</i>

15:26.760 --> 15:30.230
<i>In fact, he was so distracted
by his rumbly tummy,</i>

15:30.320 --> 15:34.359
<i>that he didn't notice that he was
walking onto the next paragraph.</i>

15:34.440 --> 15:36.271
What is a paragraph?

15:36.360 --> 15:40.148
<i>It's a group of sentences
that form a complete thought.</i>

15:41.240 --> 15:43.834
Is there honey in this paragraph?

15:43.920 --> 15:46.434
<i>Oh, sorry, Pooh, no.</i>

15:46.520 --> 15:49.592
Well, then I don't find it very useful.

15:50.680 --> 15:52.352
<i>What's that, Pooh?</i>

15:52.440 --> 15:57.116
I'm not sure. I shall follow it
to see where it leads.

15:58.120 --> 16:00.634
Eeyore, your tail!

16:00.720 --> 16:04.838
Yep. Unravelled.
Guess I'm back where I started.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.956
[Pooh] I'm sorry, Eeyore.

16:07.040 --> 16:09.270
Such a nice tail, too.

16:09.360 --> 16:13.558
No matter.
All good things come to an end.

16:14.880 --> 16:18.350
Oh. Oh! Eeyore, if you...
[grunting]

16:19.520 --> 16:22.796
Oh, my goodness.
This story is going too fast!

16:22.880 --> 16:24.836
[grunts, sighs]

16:24.920 --> 16:28.390
I wish that paragraph
had been a little longer.

16:28.480 --> 16:30.277
Ooh! Of course.

16:30.360 --> 16:32.749
Christopher Robin will have some honey.

16:32.840 --> 16:35.877
He loves to share.
Especially with me.

16:37.360 --> 16:40.989
[humming] Christopher Robin!

16:42.920 --> 16:45.115
Are you not there?

16:45.200 --> 16:47.919
[tummy rumbles]

16:48.000 --> 16:49.115
Oh.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.668
<i>[narrator] Just then,
Pooh spotted a note.</i>

16:51.760 --> 16:53.512
<i>- I did?
- Certainly.</i>

16:53.600 --> 16:54.999
<i>Just there, at your feet.</i>

16:55.080 --> 16:57.469
<i>- Oh...
- Uh, to your left.</i>

16:57.560 --> 17:01.519
<i>Uh, no, Pooh, your other left.
A little bit more.</i>

17:01.600 --> 17:04.512
<i>A tad. A hair.
No, no, back a bit.</i>

17:05.720 --> 17:07.153
<i>- Oh!
- There you are.</i>

17:07.240 --> 17:09.195
Well, it's a good thing I noticed it.

17:09.280 --> 17:12.352
Otherwise, I wouldn't have seen it.

17:13.280 --> 17:17.671
<i>Pooh was puzzled by the note.
Even more so than usual.</i>

17:17.760 --> 17:19.954
And even more than that.

17:20.720 --> 17:23.598
<i>So, Pooh decided to go directly
to Owl's house,</i>

17:23.680 --> 17:26.398
<i>hoping that Owl could help unpuzzle him.</i>

17:26.480 --> 17:29.472
<i># You get the honey
Enjoy #</i>

17:29.560 --> 17:31.915
- Good job, Owl!
- Thank you. Thank you.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.558
Yes, it is quite clever, isn't it?

17:33.640 --> 17:36.791
T-A-E-L. Yes. Perfect.

17:36.880 --> 17:38.518
Well, hello there, Owl.

17:38.600 --> 17:42.878
That is a very fine looking pot of honey
you've got there.

17:42.960 --> 17:46.839
And so remarkably... gooey.

17:46.920 --> 17:52.199
Gooey? That happens to be
my personal favourite.

17:52.840 --> 17:54.990
Ooh! What do you have there, my boy?

17:55.080 --> 17:57.913
Oh. A note I found
at Christopher Robin's.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.959
With strange words I cannot read.

18:02.040 --> 18:04.270
But, Pooh, you can't read most words.

18:04.360 --> 18:07.830
Yes, but especially not
the strange ones.

18:07.920 --> 18:12.232
Let me see. There's never been a note
written that I could not decipher.

18:12.320 --> 18:13.912
Here, Pooh, help yourself.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.195
- Yes, parchment is of a fine quality.
- [grunting]

18:16.280 --> 18:18.396
Oh, stuff and fluff.

18:18.480 --> 18:20.675
Don't leave us in suspense, Owl.
What does it say?

18:20.760 --> 18:22.239
Patience! Patience.

18:22.320 --> 18:26.074
One must be careful when decoding
such arcane text

18:26.160 --> 18:28.993
so as not to incorrectly interpret
its true meaning.

18:29.080 --> 18:30.718
So, can you read it?

18:30.800 --> 18:32.711
Of course I can! It says...

18:32.800 --> 18:35.314
"Gone out. Busy. Backson.

18:35.400 --> 18:37.118
Signed, Christopher Robin."

18:37.200 --> 18:41.159
[gasps] Our dear friend
Christopher Robin has been captured!

18:41.240 --> 18:44.277
- What?
- By a creature called "The Backson."

18:44.360 --> 18:46.316
- [all gasp]
- Backson!

18:46.400 --> 18:48.277
Captured by the Backson!

18:48.360 --> 18:50.271
- What's a Backson?
- Ooh!

18:50.360 --> 18:52.874
A horrible creature! Malicious!

18:52.960 --> 18:54.712
- You don't say.
- Ferocious!

18:54.800 --> 18:55.949
Fero?! Ooh!

18:56.040 --> 18:59.157
And worst of all, terribly busy.

18:59.240 --> 19:02.038
So, what does this Backson look like?

19:02.120 --> 19:04.076
I saw a picture of one
just the other day.

19:04.160 --> 19:07.311
- Oh, Christopher Robin.
- [Owl] Now, let me see.

19:07.400 --> 19:11.473
Bathwater, biscuit, baby,
barnacle, beluga...

19:11.560 --> 19:14.120
Wait a minute, why is biscuit
ahead of baby and barnacle?

19:14.200 --> 19:16.316
That doesn't make sense.
Oh, it's such a mess in here.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.550
Dash it all!
Where is that picture?

19:18.640 --> 19:21.359
I have some chalk, Owl.
Can you draw it?

19:21.440 --> 19:23.431
What an excellent idea, young man.

19:23.520 --> 19:25.954
Artistic talent runs through my family.

19:26.040 --> 19:29.629
- In fact, it practically stampedes!

19:29.720 --> 19:31.915
- [both groan]
- [whimpering]

19:32.000 --> 19:33.399

19:37.280 --> 19:39.350
<i># Here, I'll draw Piglet in for scale</i>

<i>[narrator] While Rabbit and the others</i>

22:18.760 --> 22:21.672
<i>were busy gathering
the Backson's favourite things,</i>

22:21.760 --> 22:25.548
<i>Pooh and Piglet found the perfect place
to dig the pit.</i>

22:25.640 --> 22:30.794
<i>- Piglet dug, and dug, and dug.
- [grunting]</i>

22:30.880 --> 22:33.269
<i>And Pooh supervised.</i>

22:33.360 --> 22:37.114
And now to disguise the pit.
Catch, Piglet.

22:37.200 --> 22:39.839
Gosh, Pooh, I hope this idea works.

22:39.920 --> 22:41.512
Oh, it will, Piglet.

22:41.600 --> 22:46.116
The Backson shall follow the trail
of items right to this lovely picnic.

22:46.200 --> 22:48.430
[whispering] Which is
just the pit, of course.

22:48.520 --> 22:51.512
And when he falls in,
we'll get Christopher Robin back.

22:51.600 --> 22:55.752
Yes, Piglet. We shall get
Christopher Robin back.

22:55.840 --> 22:59.150
Very exciting. [giggles]
What do you think, Pooh?

22:59.240 --> 23:03.392
Hmm. I think this rock
would be better over there.

23:08.440 --> 23:09.429
Here?

23:09.520 --> 23:12.398
Oh, yes. That makes
all the difference, you see.

23:12.480 --> 23:15.392
Oh! I almost forgot
the most important part.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.152
Oh, yes, Piglet.
I couldn't agree more.

23:22.680 --> 23:23.999
Hmm?

23:24.640 --> 23:28.519
Oh, Piglet, this is a very light lunch.

23:29.040 --> 23:31.508
No, Pooh. This isn't lunch.

23:31.600 --> 23:34.273
I just thought it would
complete the disguise.

23:34.360 --> 23:37.113
Well, it certainly fooled me.

23:38.320 --> 23:39.719
[whimpers]

23:40.360 --> 23:42.794
Well done, you two.
Now, put your combat gear on.

23:42.880 --> 23:46.668
This is a dangerous mission,
and we cannot afford any mistakes.

23:46.760 --> 23:50.753
The fate of Christopher Robin
is in our hands.

You want to keep it down up there, pal?

<i>What? Tigger?
Why aren't you with the others?</i>

25:04.360 --> 25:08.319
Because. I'm busy tracking the Backson.
Shh-shh-shh.

25:08.400 --> 25:10.595
<i>Yes, but what about Rabbit's plan?</i>

25:10.680 --> 25:14.798
Only a Tigger can catch a Backson.
[whispers] And I'm the only Tigger, see.

- [gasps] Hello.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.437

25:20.520 --> 25:23.034
- Hoo!
- I probably deserved that.

25:23.120 --> 25:26.157
Oops! Look who it is! Hoo-hoo!
Let me get off your back.

25:26.240 --> 25:28.549
There we go.
I thought you were the Backson!

25:28.640 --> 25:31.279
Until I found out you wasn't.
What are you doing out here, anyways?

25:31.360 --> 25:34.193
Too slow. Got left behind.

25:34.280 --> 25:35.952
Left behind?

25:36.040 --> 25:38.838
That's a horrendemous thing
to do to a guy.

25:38.920 --> 25:40.319
No matter.

25:40.400 --> 25:43.358
Sure would like to help
Christopher Robin,

- Hmm.

25:47.920 --> 25:50.309
Buddy! Where do you think
you're going?

25:50.400 --> 25:52.755
You and me are gonna catch
that Backson together!

25:52.840 --> 25:55.035
- Thanks, but I...
- That's the spirit!

26:08.520 --> 26:13.230
Buddy, if you're gonna pounce,
you got to have some bounce!

I like your style!

28:33.200 --> 28:35.077
Now this is just ridicerous!

Gosh, Pooh, I hope the Backson
is pleased with all of our items.

- I'm sure he will be. Oh.

Piglet, um, could you come here, please?

29:13.840 --> 29:16.308
Pooh, are you sure
this is going to work?

29:16.400 --> 29:17.753
Well, of course, Piglet.

29:17.840 --> 29:22.311
Once I get you up in the tree,
just hand me the beehive.

29:22.400 --> 29:26.234
And then tummy and I will
take care of the rest, won't we?

29:26.320 --> 29:29.073
OK, Pooh.
I guess you've thought this through.

29:29.160 --> 29:31.628
Oh, yes, Piglet. Indeed I have.

29:32.560 --> 29:33.879
[Piglet grunts]

29:33.960 --> 29:38.397
Oh, bother. I don't remember
thinking that through.

29:38.480 --> 29:41.358
[Piglet] Um, I'm sorry
I messed up the plan, Pooh.

29:41.440 --> 29:43.317
Oh, don't worry, Piglet.

29:43.400 --> 29:47.871
I shall get you out,
and we'll try again.

29:47.960 --> 29:51.714
[grunts] It's no use.
Think, think, think.

29:51.800 --> 29:54.234
Ah! I know.

29:54.320 --> 29:57.153
I'll have you down
in just a moment, Piglet.

29:57.240 --> 29:59.800
[Piglet] No hurry, Pooh.
The bees are quite gentle.

29:59.880 --> 30:02.075
[giggles]
As long as there's no sudden movement.

30:02.160 --> 30:03.991
Ah! Oh, my!

30:04.080 --> 30:06.389
Pooh, are you sure that's a good idea?

30:06.480 --> 30:08.311
Oh, yes, Piglet.

30:08.400 --> 30:10.277
- Ah!
- I'm quite sure.

30:10.360 --> 30:12.351
Well, you know best, Pooh.

- Ah! Oh.
- Oh. There we are.

30:16.120 --> 30:19.510
Oops. New plan, Piglet. Run!

30:19.600 --> 30:21.033
[Piglet] OK.

[grunting]

30:24.280 --> 30:27.113
Oh... Is this fast enough, Pooh?

30:27.200 --> 30:30.158
I suppose you could run a little faster.

30:30.240 --> 30:31.275
- [Piglet] Whoa!
- Ooh!

30:32.480 --> 30:35.278
And this can go here. All done.

30:35.360 --> 30:37.351
It takes a smart rabbit
to trap a Back...

30:38.680 --> 30:41.319
Oh! What are you two doing?

30:41.400 --> 30:44.153
Beehives are not on my list
of Backson-friendly items!

30:44.240 --> 30:46.117
- But, Rabbit, the...
- Move along, move along.

30:46.200 --> 30:47.872
Well, I was moving.

30:48.960 --> 30:51.758
Oh, that Backson is sure
to pick up this trail,

30:51.840 --> 30:53.717
and we don't want to be around
when he does.

30:53.800 --> 30:55.119
Come, come! Go, go, go!

30:55.200 --> 30:58.033
Rabbit, please, can we stop for lunch?

30:58.120 --> 31:01.317
Pooh, we cannot rest until
Christopher Robin is rescued.

31:01.400 --> 31:03.834
Try thinking of him instead of honey.

31:04.240 --> 31:07.676

31:07.760 --> 31:11.719

Eh, Owl?

31:36.920 --> 31:40.276
That cheeky honey will honey twice
before honeying our honey again.

can I honey a honey?

33:54.640 --> 33:55.675
[groans]

33:55.760 --> 33:56.749
Bother.

34:01.560 --> 34:04.358
[gasping]

34:04.440 --> 34:07.512
What a lovely picnic!

34:08.639 --> 34:10.039
[shouts]

34:11.920 --> 34:13.319
Oh, bother!

34:14.560 --> 34:16.596
Double bother.

34:17.400 --> 34:21.074
Pooh! Now where did that bear go?

34:21.159 --> 34:23.355
We searched all over,
and no sign of him.

34:23.440 --> 34:27.831
The report from my aerial excursion
is inconclusive.

34:27.920 --> 34:30.150
- [Pooh moaning]
- [clanking]

34:30.239 --> 34:31.911
[all shout]

34:33.000 --> 34:36.356
[gasps] The plan worked.
We caught the Backson!

34:36.440 --> 34:39.273
- [Pooh continues moaning]
- Oh! It sounds horrible!

34:39.360 --> 34:43.239
Now that we have him, Owl, you can go
and get Christopher Robin back.

34:43.320 --> 34:47.632
No! No, I'm far too important
to put myself in that predicament.

34:47.719 --> 34:49.072
Kanga, off you go.

34:49.159 --> 34:51.719
Oh, no, no, no. I'm with child.

34:51.800 --> 34:52.789
Send the pig.

34:52.880 --> 34:54.710
[stammering]

34:55.840 --> 34:59.037
- How about all of us go?
- [Pooh groans]

34:59.720 --> 35:03.235
All right, Backson.
Give Christopher Robin back!

35:03.320 --> 35:05.151
- Huh?
- [Pooh] Oh!

35:05.240 --> 35:06.593
Oh, bother!

35:06.680 --> 35:09.752
- Pooh!
- Oh, hello.

35:09.840 --> 35:12.957
Oh, Pooh, you went back for the honey,
didn't you?

35:13.040 --> 35:15.190
But I told you it was empty.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.748
Yes, and I believed you, Piglet.

35:17.840 --> 35:20.434
But my tummy had to see for himself.

35:20.520 --> 35:22.476
[scoffs] Poor, poor Pooh.

35:22.560 --> 35:25.233
How are we ever gonna
get him out of there?

35:25.320 --> 35:28.949
<i># It's me, it's me</i>

35:29.880 --> 35:32.440

35:32.520 --> 35:35.432
<i># Found this anchor over there</i>

35:35.520 --> 35:38.637
<i># Now it's on my derrière</i>

35:38.720 --> 35:42.554
<i># Not that anybody'd care #</i>

35:53.360 --> 35:56.113
[Rabbit] OK, everyone,
make sure you have a good hold.

35:56.200 --> 35:59.192
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

35:59.280 --> 36:02.750
Something tells me I was better off
with Tigger.

36:02.840 --> 36:03.955
Heave-ho!

36:04.840 --> 36:06.831
- Yep.
- [all shout]

36:11.320 --> 36:12.992
[whistling fall]

36:13.560 --> 36:15.118
[all grunt]

36:16.320 --> 36:17.469
Oh, this is lovely.

36:17.560 --> 36:22.076
We are stuck down here,
and the Backson is still up there.

36:22.160 --> 36:26.517
[whimpering] Oh, dear! Wait for me.

36:26.600 --> 36:28.352
No, Piglet! No, no, Piglet. Stay.

36:28.440 --> 36:30.635
But the Backson!

36:30.720 --> 36:33.188
You can help us if you stay up there!

36:33.280 --> 36:35.555
[straining]

36:36.280 --> 36:39.590
OK, Piglet, go look for something
to get us out of here.

36:39.680 --> 36:42.478
[stammering] OK.

36:42.560 --> 36:45.199
There might be
something over by the pack.

36:45.280 --> 36:47.271
Thank goodness one of us is up there.

36:47.360 --> 36:49.032
I was worried we'd be
stuck here forever.

36:49.120 --> 36:51.634
I found something. Here.

36:51.720 --> 36:52.789
- What?
- Ooh.

36:52.880 --> 36:55.155
That's a lovely flower, Piglet.

36:55.240 --> 36:57.117
Yeah, I thought so, too.

36:57.200 --> 37:00.192
Yes, Piglet,
it's very nice, a perennial.

37:00.280 --> 37:02.953
But I think we need something longer.

37:03.040 --> 37:07.591
Longer? Of course.
How silly of me.

37:08.600 --> 37:09.874
[grunting]

37:12.560 --> 37:14.312
Oh, good thought, Piglet.

37:14.400 --> 37:17.153
But you can't possibly think
that that's long enough.

37:17.240 --> 37:20.357
Oh, yes, it is.
Owl read this to me once,

37:20.440 --> 37:23.637
and it was certainly the longest thing
I'd ever heard.

37:23.720 --> 37:24.709
[giggles] Oh.

37:24.800 --> 37:28.031
It's true, Rabbit.
It lags a bit in the middle.

37:28.120 --> 37:31.396
Of all things, why didn't we think
to bring a rope?

37:31.480 --> 37:33.914
Well, there is this rope.

37:35.720 --> 37:39.793
Spot-on, Piglet. Do be a helpful
little swine and get us out of here.

37:39.880 --> 37:41.074
All of you?

37:41.160 --> 37:43.594
Yes, Piglet, all of us.

37:44.360 --> 37:47.875
All right. Three, four...
Don't forget Rabbit.

37:51.040 --> 37:52.996
[scissors snipping]

37:54.480 --> 37:56.232
[Piglet] And six.

37:56.320 --> 37:58.629
There! Now you can all get out!

37:58.720 --> 38:01.712
How very thoughtful you are, Piglet.

38:01.800 --> 38:04.633
Good grief! Tie them together, Piglet.

38:04.720 --> 38:06.472
Can you tie a knot?

38:06.560 --> 38:07.595
I cannot.

38:07.680 --> 38:09.079
So, you can knot.

38:09.160 --> 38:10.991
No, I cannot knot.

38:11.080 --> 38:13.150
- Not knot?
- Who's there?

38:13.240 --> 38:14.309
- Pooh!
- Pooh who?

38:14.400 --> 38:15.879
No! Pooh, it's...

38:15.960 --> 38:18.520
Piglet, you'll need more than two knots.

38:18.600 --> 38:19.715
Not possible.

38:19.800 --> 38:23.031
Ah! So, it is possible
to knot those pieces.

38:23.120 --> 38:24.189
Not these pieces.

38:24.280 --> 38:26.236
Yes, knot those pieces.

38:26.320 --> 38:28.834
- Why not?
- Because it's all for naught.

38:28.920 --> 38:32.515
Oh, dear! I can't tie a knot.

38:32.600 --> 38:34.477
But there is something I can do.

38:35.680 --> 38:39.150
Don't worry, Rabbit.
Piglet's very clever.

38:39.240 --> 38:41.310
I can tie a bow.

38:41.400 --> 38:43.072
- See?
- [groans]

38:43.160 --> 38:46.072
For crying out loud! Piglet!

38:46.160 --> 38:48.390
I know! Christopher Robin
has a jump rope.

38:48.480 --> 38:49.708
Ahh!

38:49.800 --> 38:53.031
Wait a minute.
My gracious, that's it!

38:53.120 --> 38:56.157
Piglet, go to Christopher Robin's house.

38:56.240 --> 38:57.468
Oh, I see.

38:57.560 --> 39:00.358
Yes, Piglet, go, and bring some honey.

39:00.440 --> 39:01.839
Yes, bring some honey...

39:01.920 --> 39:04.514
[gasps] The jump rope,
Piglet, the jump rope.

39:04.600 --> 39:06.989
With a little honey on the side.

39:07.080 --> 39:09.799
You mean, all by myself?

39:12.760 --> 39:14.910
Through there?

39:15.000 --> 39:16.479
Yes, Piglet.

39:17.480 --> 39:20.358
Through a dark wood
fraught with peril,

39:20.440 --> 39:22.271
on a mission of life or death.

39:22.360 --> 39:25.079
It is a task of great complexity,

39:25.160 --> 39:29.278
but I have full confidence
that you shall return victorious,

39:29.360 --> 39:32.113
and rescue us from the abyss.

39:32.200 --> 39:35.033
Go forth, Piglet,
and we shall await your return.

39:35.120 --> 39:37.509
For weeks, if necessary.

39:40.840 --> 39:42.114
Owl!

39:45.240 --> 39:46.355
What?

39:46.440 --> 39:50.831
I can't believe how wonderful
that speech was.

39:50.920 --> 39:52.194
I can't, either.

39:52.280 --> 39:54.271
Moved me to tears.

39:55.080 --> 39:59.119
<i>[narrator] So Piglet bravely ventured
forth towards Christopher Robin's house.</i>

39:59.200 --> 40:03.990
<i>But the further he went,
the more frightened he became.</i>

40:04.080 --> 40:06.992
[whimpering] Oh, dear.

40:07.720 --> 40:09.790
I mustn't fear.

40:11.160 --> 40:14.755
There's a very important thing to...

40:14.840 --> 40:18.549
[heavy stammer] Do...

40:18.640 --> 40:20.198
[screams]

40:20.280 --> 40:22.635
[whimpering]

40:25.240 --> 40:29.916
Oh. It's just you, B'loon.
I'll get some help.

40:30.640 --> 40:32.995
Oh, dear. I am the help.

40:35.400 --> 40:37.675
How did you ever get stuck up there?

40:37.760 --> 40:40.718
It wasn't the Backson, was it?

40:42.360 --> 40:43.588
Oh, good.

40:43.680 --> 40:45.716
I knew the Backson wasn't around here.

40:45.800 --> 40:47.552
[grunts]

40:56.160 --> 40:57.434
[Tigger grunts]

40:57.520 --> 40:59.590
[moaning]

40:59.680 --> 41:02.194
[stammering] Backson!

41:02.280 --> 41:04.191
Huh?! Backson?

41:05.760 --> 41:07.955
- [screaming]
- Piglet, help!

41:09.960 --> 41:11.188
Whew.

41:11.280 --> 41:12.918
[shouting]

41:21.800 --> 41:25.236
Let me tell you, that was the last time
I'll ever put my beak

41:25.320 --> 41:26.992
- in a keyhole.
- Shh-shh-shh!

41:27.080 --> 41:29.469
[whispers] Do you hear something?

41:30.560 --> 41:32.551
- Help! Help me!
- Piglet!

41:32.640 --> 41:34.631
He knows my name!

41:36.040 --> 41:37.553
[blowing hard]

41:39.800 --> 41:41.358
- Yeah!
- [gasp]

41:42.440 --> 41:43.953
Whoa! Oh!

41:44.040 --> 41:45.632
[shouting]

41:51.680 --> 41:53.079
Ah!

41:54.920 --> 41:57.309
- [straining]
- [grunting]

42:01.720 --> 42:03.199
[groaning]

42:03.280 --> 42:05.032
[screams]

42:06.840 --> 42:08.432
[Piglet groans]

42:09.120 --> 42:10.235
[all gasp] Backson!

42:11.400 --> 42:13.470
Whew! It's only Tigger.

42:13.560 --> 42:16.597
Oh! Hi, fellas!

42:16.680 --> 42:20.468
Tigger Two?
I thought the Backson got you.

42:20.560 --> 42:22.391
Ahh. As soon as we get out of here,

42:22.480 --> 42:25.870
we're gonna show that Backson
what Tiggers are made of, aren't we?

42:25.960 --> 42:28.713
Thanks, but I'd rather stay an Eeyore.

42:28.800 --> 42:31.678
What? But what about all the pouncing
and the trouncing?

42:31.760 --> 42:34.399
And the mixing it up?
I thought you liked being a Tigger.

42:34.480 --> 42:36.994
The most wonderful thing about Tiggers,

42:37.080 --> 42:39.913
is you're the only one.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.754
Aw, shucks. I'm speechless.

42:43.840 --> 42:45.068
[Piglet] Excuse me.

42:45.160 --> 42:48.675
- I can't breathe! [groans]
- [Tigger] Oh.

42:51.400 --> 42:55.188
Sorry about that, little guy.
I didn't mean to scare you.

42:55.280 --> 42:57.475
Wait! B'loon! Don't leave!

42:58.520 --> 43:00.829
[Piglet] You're the only one
who can get us out of here!

43:00.920 --> 43:03.639
We're all gonna die.

43:04.480 --> 43:06.710
Cheer up, Eeyore.
We won't perish for days.

43:06.800 --> 43:09.598
Which leaves plenty of time for me
to continue my memoirs.

43:09.680 --> 43:11.079
Now, dear Uncle Ridley...

43:11.160 --> 43:12.559
<i># Honey #</i>

43:12.640 --> 43:14.312
[Owl]... exacerbated
by my aunt's predilection

43:14.400 --> 43:16.595
- for only the finest parchment...
- Hmm. [gasps]

43:16.680 --> 43:19.194
...woven so tightly
the ink took weeks to fully dry.

43:19.280 --> 43:22.192
Their nest was littered with quills
that were never used,

43:22.280 --> 43:24.748
papers that were never cut,
and letters that never dried.

43:24.840 --> 43:28.549
My aunt often bemoaned the situation in
letters that she couldn't write to me.

43:28.640 --> 43:31.359
It drove my poor uncle
absolutely batty,

43:31.440 --> 43:33.954
which is quite a feat for an owl,
I assure you.

43:34.040 --> 43:37.191
Now, when my uncle had committed
an exceedingly rousing point...

43:37.280 --> 43:38.429
Empty.

43:39.600 --> 43:42.239
...and let me tell you,
it packed quite a wallop.

43:42.320 --> 43:43.833
- [groans]
- Huh?

43:43.920 --> 43:45.114
Look! Look, the letters!

43:45.200 --> 43:47.475
The ladder! The ladders formed a letter!

43:47.560 --> 43:49.551
I mean the letters...
We can get out!

43:49.640 --> 43:54.156
<i>[narrator] And so they all used the
letter ladder to climb out of the pit.</i>

43:55.120 --> 43:58.192
<i>But little did they know that
coming through the bushes was...</i>

43:58.280 --> 44:00.430
- [branches snapping]
- [all gasp] Backson!

44:00.520 --> 44:01.919
Back to the pit!

44:02.000 --> 44:04.195
[Christopher] Wait, everyone.

44:04.800 --> 44:06.677
It's only me.

44:06.760 --> 44:08.955
[all] Christopher Robin!

44:10.120 --> 44:12.315
You found them, B'loon. Well done.

44:12.400 --> 44:15.073
It's Christopher Robin!

44:15.160 --> 44:17.230
How did you escape from the Backson?

44:17.320 --> 44:20.118
Backson? What on earth is a Backson?

44:20.200 --> 44:21.394
He wakes up babies!

44:21.480 --> 44:22.799
He swipes your stripes!

44:22.880 --> 44:24.359
He puts out the lights!

44:24.440 --> 44:27.830
Yes, and we thought he took you from us.

44:27.920 --> 44:31.390
What gave you the idea
I was taken by a Backson?

44:31.480 --> 44:33.038
Your note.

44:34.320 --> 44:38.836
<i>[narrator] Christopher Robin explained
that it had all been a misunderstanding.</i>

44:38.920 --> 44:41.673
<i>And now that it was autumn,
the school year had begun.</i>

44:41.760 --> 44:46.675
<i>His note was simply to say he had
gone out and would be back soon.</i>

44:47.960 --> 44:50.110
[all] Oh!

44:52.320 --> 44:53.833
Ooh. Um...

44:56.520 --> 44:58.511
OK.

44:58.600 --> 45:00.909
It's getting late.
We ought to be heading back.

45:01.000 --> 45:02.711
Just a moment, everyone.

45:02.800 --> 45:04.518
Oh, yes. You're right, Piglet.

45:04.600 --> 45:06.591
We owe a very special someone...

45:06.680 --> 45:09.797
...a token of our appreciation.

45:09.880 --> 45:11.029
Ohh!

45:11.120 --> 45:14.954
This reward goes to a good friend
and a loyal companion.

45:15.040 --> 45:17.315
Someone who not only helped us
out of this pit,

45:17.400 --> 45:19.630
but also found Christopher Robin.

45:19.720 --> 45:23.508
And he just so happens
to be wearing red today.

45:23.600 --> 45:26.558
So it is with great, great honour
and a humble heart,

45:26.640 --> 45:30.713
that I bestow this pot of honey
upon our dear friend...

45:30.800 --> 45:31.994
...B'loon.

45:32.080 --> 45:33.479
Wonderful idea, Rabbit.

45:33.560 --> 45:35.949
- Hooray!
- Hooray, B'loon!

45:36.520 --> 45:39.830
- Thank you, B'loon. Goodbye.
- Hooray!

45:39.920 --> 45:43.879
<i>[narrator] Pooh watched as B'loon took
the honey pot higher and higher,</i>

45:43.960 --> 45:48.556
<i>until it was completely out of sight.</i>

45:48.640 --> 45:51.279
Oh, bother.

45:57.160 --> 45:59.310
Sorry, Pooh.

45:59.400 --> 46:04.030
Ever have one of those days
where you just can't win, Eeyore?

46:04.120 --> 46:07.590
Yep. I know how you feel.

46:11.680 --> 46:13.796
- [rumbling]
- Oh, yes.

46:13.880 --> 46:16.075
I simply must find some honey.

46:16.160 --> 46:19.197
<i>[narrator] As Pooh continued searching,
he got hungrier...</i>

46:20.400 --> 46:22.550
<i>- Oh!
- ...and hungrier...</i>

46:23.320 --> 46:26.278
<i>- Yes, tummy, I know.
- ...and hungrier...</i>

46:26.360 --> 46:28.191
Ohh...

46:28.280 --> 46:31.716
<i>...until he found himself
at Owl's house.</i>

46:45.640 --> 46:46.629
[bell jingles]

46:48.720 --> 46:51.359
Well, stone the crows.
If it isn't Pooh Bear.

46:51.440 --> 46:53.635
Hello, Owl.

46:53.720 --> 46:56.678
Well, congratulate me.

46:56.760 --> 46:59.320
- For what?
- I have achieved completion

46:59.400 --> 47:02.278
of my autobiographical treatise!

47:02.360 --> 47:04.032
Oh! Was it painful?

47:04.120 --> 47:07.157
No, no, no. My memoirs are finished.

47:07.240 --> 47:08.434
Oh.

47:08.960 --> 47:12.555
Dash it all, Pooh. Why do you keep
staring at that bell rope?

47:12.640 --> 47:17.236
Because it reminds me of something.

47:17.320 --> 47:19.959
And that reminds me
of another something.

47:20.040 --> 47:21.951
Perhaps I could borrow some honey?

47:22.040 --> 47:25.715
Just a taste? A drop, perhaps?

47:25.800 --> 47:27.392
A small lick, I should think.

47:27.480 --> 47:30.358
My boy, I shall do better than that.

47:30.440 --> 47:32.351
Not only will I beckon you
to my table,

47:32.440 --> 47:36.194
but as we feast,
I shall treat you to an excerpt

47:36.280 --> 47:38.555
from chapter 127,

47:38.640 --> 47:42.838
which tells the gripping tale of how
only a few days ago,

47:42.920 --> 47:45.957
I found that very handsome bell rope
that you were admiring

47:46.040 --> 47:49.271
just hanging over a thistle bush.

47:49.360 --> 47:50.634
Thistle bush?

47:50.720 --> 47:52.438
Or was it a gorse bush?

47:52.520 --> 47:55.592
No. No. It was definitely
a thistle bush.

47:55.680 --> 47:56.874
Pardon me, Owl.

47:56.960 --> 47:59.520
At first I thought someone lived there,
so I rang it.

47:59.600 --> 48:00.794
No one answered.

48:00.880 --> 48:03.633
And then the thing just fell off
in my hand.

48:03.720 --> 48:07.554
What sort of place
was this particular thistle bush in?

48:07.640 --> 48:09.835
Certainly not a very cheery place.

48:09.920 --> 48:11.990
One might say it was rather...

48:12.080 --> 48:13.479
Gloomy?

48:13.560 --> 48:16.028
Yes. That's it. Do you know it?

48:16.120 --> 48:17.348
Oh, dear.

48:17.440 --> 48:19.954
Nobody seemed to want it,
so I brought it home.

48:20.040 --> 48:22.634
Oh, but somebody did want it, Owl.

48:22.720 --> 48:24.073
Really? Who?

48:24.160 --> 48:27.072
Eeyore. My dear friend Eeyore.

48:27.160 --> 48:29.071
He was fond of it, you see.

48:29.160 --> 48:31.720
- Fond of it?
- Attached to it.

48:31.800 --> 48:33.358
Attached?

48:33.440 --> 48:35.237
Ohh!

48:35.320 --> 48:37.231
Yes. Well, yes.

48:37.320 --> 48:41.074
And I was just keeping it safe for him.

48:41.160 --> 48:44.232
Well, there you are.
And you can tell him he's welcome.

48:44.320 --> 48:47.278
Yes, Owl. And thank you very much.

48:47.360 --> 48:50.238
I say, Pooh! What about the honey?

48:53.600 --> 48:55.591
[tummy rumbles]

48:56.840 --> 48:59.229
Some other time, perhaps?

49:01.120 --> 49:03.680
<i>[narrator] Ignoring his tummy's
desperate pleas,</i>

49:03.760 --> 49:05.876
<i>Pooh went directly
to Christopher Robin's.</i>

49:05.960 --> 49:06.949
Tail.

49:07.760 --> 49:09.512
Nail.

49:09.600 --> 49:10.749
Hammer.

49:14.560 --> 49:16.551
So what do you think, Eeyore?

49:16.640 --> 49:18.710
I'll test it out.

49:20.280 --> 49:22.510
Seems about the right length.

49:22.600 --> 49:25.114
Pink bow's a nice touch.

49:26.080 --> 49:29.390
Swishes real good, too.

49:29.480 --> 49:31.596
So, are you happy, Eeyore?

49:31.680 --> 49:33.750
- No.
- Ooh.

49:33.840 --> 49:37.116
But I sure do like this new tail.

49:39.000 --> 49:40.479
Thank you, Pooh.

49:41.400 --> 49:44.119
And now,
I have a surprise for you, Pooh.

49:44.200 --> 49:46.668
I do like surprises.

49:46.760 --> 49:49.035
[Christopher] OK. Open your eyes.

49:49.120 --> 49:50.997
They're open, Christopher.

49:51.080 --> 49:54.356
[Christopher] No, silly.
Put your arms down.

49:55.640 --> 50:00.111
Congratulations, Pooh.
You win the grand prize!

50:00.200 --> 50:03.112
<i># It's Pooh
It's Pooh</i>

50:03.200 --> 50:05.668
<i># Pooh wins the honey pot</i>

50:05.760 --> 50:08.513
<i># You're the winner of the prize</i>

50:08.600 --> 50:11.034
<i># I really can't believe my eyes</i>

50:11.120 --> 50:13.953
<i># Pooh gets the honey</i>

50:14.040 --> 50:16.429
<i># Honey, honey, honey, honey</i>

50:16.520 --> 50:17.748
Here you go, Pooh.

50:17.840 --> 50:19.592
Oh, yes, of course.

50:26.280 --> 50:29.033
- [all gasp]
- Thank you all ever so much.

50:29.960 --> 50:33.669
<i># Everything is honey
Everything is good</i>

50:33.760 --> 50:37.753
<i># Everyone is happy
in the Hundred Acre Wood</i>

50:37.840 --> 50:41.037
<i># A honey happy ending
for a Pooh to eat</i>

50:41.120 --> 50:45.477
<i># Yes, everything is honey</i>

50:45.560 --> 50:51.556
<i># And life is very sweet #</i>

50:51.680 --> 50:55.070
You know, Pooh, you did
a very important thing today.

50:55.160 --> 50:57.913
- I did?
- Well, yes.

50:58.000 --> 51:01.231
Instead of thinking of your tummy,
you thought of your friend.

51:01.320 --> 51:02.958
Oh, thank you, Christopher Robin.

51:03.040 --> 51:06.430
And now I don't think
I shall be hungry again

51:06.520 --> 51:09.432
for a good long while.

51:09.520 --> 51:11.909
- [tummy rumbles]
- [Pooh] Oh, bother.

51:12.000 --> 51:13.672
[Christopher] Silly old bear.

56:59.640 --> 57:00.834
[sighs]

57:10.160 --> 57:11.559
[croaks]

57:59.360 --> 58:01.351
Oh! Ooh, ooh, ooh!

58:23.560 --> 58:26.552
[unintelligible dialogue]

59:26.160 --> 59:28.993
- [crickets chirring]
- [frogs croaking]

59:30.400 --> 59:31.799
[thudding]

59:40.400 --> 59:43.949
Wow! It's amazing
what you can find in the woods.

59:44.040 --> 59:47.032
A marble! And a boot!

59:47.120 --> 59:50.829
And oh, my,
that's a scary-lookin' fella.

59:50.920 --> 59:53.878
Gosh! Maybe these are his things.

59:53.960 --> 59:56.554
You know, I better pick 'em up
so they won't get broken.

59:56.640 --> 59:58.232
That's the last thing I would want.

59:58.320 --> 59:59.639
Whoa!

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:02.953
- [thud]
- [grunt] Oh, my gosh!

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:06.157
Is this a pit?
I think I'm in a pit!

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:09.357
Hello? Anybody up there?

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:13.638
Oh, well. I sure hope that fella
will be back soon.
