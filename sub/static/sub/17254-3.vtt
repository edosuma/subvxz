WEBVTT

00:03.404 --> 00:04.638
- CAN'T BELIEVE THAT DUDE IS
ONLY 50.

00:04.672 --> 00:05.973
HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS 100.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.241
- HARD LIVING,
THAT'S WHAT THAT IS.

00:07.275 --> 00:09.077
- WE ALL NEED TO DRINK
MORE WATER.

00:09.110 --> 00:10.478
- MAYBE HE'S ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE
WHO'S ALWAYS LOOKED OLD,

00:10.511 --> 00:11.745
LIKE WILFORD BRIMLEY.

00:11.779 --> 00:13.147
- AND JOHN MADDEN.
- MORGAN FREEMAN.

00:13.181 --> 00:14.415
- THEY SAY BLACK DON'T CRACK?

00:14.448 --> 00:16.317
THAT BROTHER CAME
OUT OF THE WOMB CRACKED.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.252
- WHAT ABOUT ANGELA LANSBURY?
SHE'S BEEN 80 FOR LIKE 40 YEARS.

00:18.286 --> 00:19.753
- OH, THEN THERE'S
MICHELLE PFEIFFER.

00:19.787 --> 00:20.988
SHE'S BEEN 40 FOR 50 YEARS.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.191
- MICHELLE PFEIFFER, OH BOY.

00:23.224 --> 00:26.360
IF SHE COULD JUST STAY 40 FOR
ANOTHER 15 YEARS?

00:26.394 --> 00:28.096
- THEN WHAT WOULD YOU DO, BRIAN?

00:28.129 --> 00:31.732
- MMM, I'D TREAT HER SO GOOD.
- OH...

00:31.765 --> 00:34.102
- [laughs]

00:36.537 --> 00:38.706

00:41.975 --> 00:43.577
- OH-HO.

00:43.611 --> 00:45.779
HOW DID YOU GUYS KNOW THAT?
- WE WORK IN THE DEATH BUSINESS.

00:45.813 --> 00:48.382
- GOD, THINK OF ALL THE STREET
CRED THOSE CHICKS HAVE.

00:48.416 --> 00:52.086
SEX WITH THEM IS SO GOOD,
IT'LL KILL YOU.

00:52.120 --> 00:53.454
- YOU KNOW DUDES BE LINING UP
LIKE JUNKIES

00:53.487 --> 00:54.555
FOR MRS. MCCONAUGHEY.

00:54.588 --> 00:56.624
- WHY, SO THEY CAN DIE
DURING SEX?

00:56.657 --> 01:00.060
I MEAN, SURE I'D GET IN THAT
LINE, BUT JUST TO MEET THE WOMAN

01:00.094 --> 01:03.364
WHO GAVE US THE STAR OF SUCH
FILMS AS FOOL'S GOLD,

01:03.397 --> 01:06.066
WEDDING PLANNER,
HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS,

01:06.100 --> 01:07.601
AND FAILURE TO LAUNCH.

01:07.635 --> 01:09.103
- THOSE WERE LITERALLY HIS
WORST MOVIES.

01:09.137 --> 01:10.404
- I ACTUALLY SAW THAT LAST ONE.
- REALLY?

01:10.438 --> 01:12.373
- YEAH, IT'S GOT TERRY BRADSHAW
IN IT.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.442
I'LL SEE ANYTHING WITH BRADSHAW,
HE'S LIKE MY FAVORITE ACTOR.

01:14.475 --> 01:16.110
- I LOVE THAT DUDE--IF I HAD TO
PICK A BALD GUY OVER 60,

01:16.144 --> 01:18.446
I WOULD DEFINITELY PICK
PATRICK STEWART.

01:18.479 --> 01:21.282
BUT I WOULD LET BRADSHAW DO
A PLAY-BY-PLAY.

01:21.315 --> 01:23.451
- JUST, LIKE, SIT AND WATCH

01:45.339 --> 01:47.441

01:49.643 --> 01:51.111
WE'LL RACE FOR PINK SLIPS.

01:51.145 --> 01:52.813
- SON, THIS AIN'T
FAST AND FURIOUS.

01:52.846 --> 01:54.315
YOU DON'T HAVE A PINK SLIP
TO BET.

01:54.348 --> 01:56.450
- OH, WE NEED GAS.
- WE'LL BE FINE.

01:56.484 --> 01:58.352

01:58.386 --> 02:00.288
PRETTY MUCH OUT OF GAS, NOW
WE ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF GAS.

02:00.321 --> 02:02.456
- WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT.

02:02.490 --> 02:03.957
IT'S MY BAD, I DROPPED THE BALL.

02:03.991 --> 02:05.693
- YOU DIDN'T DROP ANYTHING!
- NOPE.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.295
- CUT ACROSS THE PARK!

LATHER OVER NOTHING.

WHOO HOO!

02:39.827 --> 02:41.462
- WHAT IF SHE NEEDS TO BE
TRANSPORTED TO THE HOSPITAL?

02:41.495 --> 02:43.364
- GOT YOU COVERED.
THERE'S A SONOCO

02:43.397 --> 02:45.132
ABOUT FOUR BLOCKS UP.
YOU BOOK IT, BRI.

02:45.165 --> 02:48.135
- OH, I'LL BE SO FAST!

HYPER TODAY.

02:51.038 --> 02:53.173
NEEDS TO BURN OFF SOME ENERGY.
NO CANDY!

03:52.633 --> 03:54.268
40%!
[laughs]

03:54.302 --> 03:57.237
- FOR THE LOVE OF GOD,
WILL YOU PLEASE SHUT UP!

03:57.271 --> 03:59.106
- WHY AM I GETTING SO MUCH
HOSTILITY HERE?

04:01.442 --> 04:04.077
YOU KNOW--YOU KNOW WHO YOU SOUND
LIKE RIGHT NOW?

04:04.111 --> 04:05.913
YOUR FATHER.
NO, YOU KNOW YOU DO.

04:05.946 --> 04:08.949
YOU KNOW YOU DO--YOU SOUND JUST
LIKE HIM, DEAD ON.

04:08.982 --> 04:10.951
- WE WOULD HAVE WON IF ALADDIN
DIDN'T GET IN THE WAY.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.453
- BUT HE DID, AND YOU DIDN'T!

04:12.486 --> 04:16.724
- AND NOW WE GET FREE BEER.
- YEAH, TAKE THAT!

04:16.757 --> 04:19.126
- SORRY, VOO.
YOU KNOW I LOVE FREE STUFF.

04:19.159 --> 04:21.595
- AT FIRST I WAS REALLY PISSED,
BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

04:21.629 --> 04:23.897
THAT DIPSH-- ACTUALLY SAVED
OUR LIVES.

04:23.931 --> 04:26.133
IF HE DIDN'T GET IN THE WAY,
THAT OTHER DIPSH-- DRIVING

04:26.166 --> 04:28.302
THE CRAPPY SEDAN WOULD'VE
T-BONED US.

04:28.336 --> 04:29.637
IT'S KIND OF LIKE SERENDIPITY.

04:29.670 --> 04:33.507
- OH, BEST MOVIE EVER,
RIGHT?

04:33.541 --> 04:37.077
YOU GUYS HAVE SEEN SERENDIPITY,
RIGHT?

04:37.110 --> 04:40.113
NONE OF YOU?
- WELL, YOU KNOW I HAVE.

04:40.147 --> 04:42.516
I HAD TO WATCH SERENDIPITY AND
THROW IN A NEVER BEEN KISSED

04:42.550 --> 04:44.251
TO GET HIM TO WATCH
FACES OF DEATH.

04:44.284 --> 04:47.621
- EVERYONE LISTEN TO ME.
LISTEN TO ME RIGHT NOW.

04:47.655 --> 04:50.123
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?
- LISTENING, BRIAN.

04:50.157 --> 04:51.659
- IT OPENS WITH ONE LITTLE
SNOWFLAKE,

04:51.692 --> 04:54.962
FALLING IN NEW YORK CITY, DURING
CHRISTMAS SHOPPING SEASON.

04:54.995 --> 04:57.465
JONATHAN, PLAYED BY THE
ALWAYS-EXCELLENT JOHN CUSACK--

04:57.498 --> 04:59.700
- I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS
SH--.

04:59.733 --> 05:02.836
- MEETS SARA, COMPLETELY
INHABITED BY AN UP-AND-COMING

05:02.870 --> 05:04.938
KATE BECKINSALE.
NOW--

05:04.972 --> 05:08.542
AFTER A MAGICAL DAY IN NEW YORK
CITY, JONATHAN SUGGESTS

05:08.576 --> 05:11.278
THAT THEY EXCHANGE NUMBERS,
WHICH--SARA AGREES.

05:11.311 --> 05:15.649
AND WRITES HERS INSIDE OF A COPY
OF LOVE IN THE TIME OF CHOLERA.

05:15.683 --> 05:18.452
BUT!
INSTEAD OF GIVING IT TO HIM,

05:18.486 --> 05:20.688
SHE PUTS IT BACK ON THE SHELF
AT THE BOOKSTORE.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.390
- I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M GONNA
DO THIS, BUT I'M GONNA

05:22.423 --> 05:23.857
ASK A QUESTION.
- PLEASE DON'T DO THAT.

05:23.891 --> 05:26.827
- WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?
JUST GIVE HIM THE NUMBER!

05:26.860 --> 05:29.663
- WHY, INDEED.
- YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT LONGER.

05:29.697 --> 05:32.466
- TO SEE IF THEY WERE DESTINED
TO BE TOGETHER.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.701
- NOW THEN--
- OH, SO SHE DIDN'T REALLY

05:33.734 --> 05:35.536
LIKE THIS GUY.
- WELL, HOLD ON, BECAUSE

05:35.569 --> 05:39.473
SARA HAS JONATHAN WRITE HIS
NUMBER DOWN ON A $5 BILL,

05:39.507 --> 05:42.075
WHICH SHE GIVES AWAY, RIGHT?
- WHY--WHY--WHY WOULDN'T HE

05:42.109 --> 05:45.679
JUST WRITE IT ON A $1 BILL?
$5 IS A LOT OF MONEY.

05:45.713 --> 05:48.081
- I AGREE.
IT'S A SLIGHT FLAW IN THE FILM.

05:48.115 --> 05:52.185
CUT TO SEVERAL YEARS LATER.
IN FACT, THE DAY BEFORE

05:52.219 --> 05:54.354
JONATHAN IS TO BE MARRIED TO
SOMEONE ELSE.

05:54.388 --> 05:55.723
- WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO US?

05:55.756 --> 05:58.692
HE TAKES A LONG WALK AROUND
NEW YORK CITY.

05:58.726 --> 06:01.429
HE'S NOT SURE HE'S MARRYING
THE RIGHT WOMAN.

06:01.462 --> 06:04.532
THAT VERY NIGHT,
HE RECEIVES A GIFT,

06:04.565 --> 06:07.501
AT HIS OWN WEDDING REHEARSAL,
AND GUESS WHAT IT IS?

06:07.535 --> 06:11.839
THAT'S RIGHT, A COPY OF
LOVE IN THE TIME OF CHOLERA.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.607
- [whimpers]

06:13.641 --> 06:16.410
SORRY.
PLEASE, CONTINUE.

06:16.444 --> 06:20.113
- HE TAKES A DEEP BREATH.
HE OPENS IT, AND YES!

06:20.147 --> 06:23.283
IT'S HER NUMBER!
AT THE SAME EXACT TIME

06:23.316 --> 06:25.686
SARA REACHES IN TO HER PURSE
TO PAY FOR A DRINK

06:25.719 --> 06:30.624
AND PULLS OUT THE $5 BILL WITH
JONATHAN'S NUMBER ON IT.

06:30.658 --> 06:32.460
DESTINY.
THEY MEET UP AGAIN

06:32.493 --> 06:35.929
IN CENTRAL PARK AND THEY KISS,
JUST AS

06:35.963 --> 06:40.768
THAT SAME LITTLE SNOWFLAKE
DRIFTS GENTLY DOWN FROM HEAVEN.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.770
- NAW, BULLSH--.
THAT IS BULLSH--.

06:42.803 --> 06:45.372
- NO GODDAMN WAY
THAT'S THE SAME SNOWFLAKE!

06:45.405 --> 06:46.740
- RESPECTFULLY, YES IT WAS.

06:46.774 --> 06:49.109
- SO WAIT, YOU THINK LIKE FIVE
WINTERS AGO,

06:49.142 --> 06:52.946
A SNOWFLAKE FELL TO THE GROUND,
AND, LIKE, MELTED,

06:52.980 --> 06:55.983
THEN EVAPORATED AND SH--,
WENT BACK UP TO THE SKY,

06:56.016 --> 06:59.587
THEN TURNED BACK INTO THE SAME
EXACT SNOWFLAKE,

06:59.620 --> 07:02.723
FLEW BACK DOWN TO EARTH AT,
LIKE, THE EXACT MOMENT THAT

07:02.756 --> 07:05.726
THAT DUDE KISSED THAT CHICK?

07:05.759 --> 07:07.461
- YES, I DO.

07:07.495 --> 07:09.262
- AND I BELIEVE YOU, BRO.

07:09.296 --> 07:10.964
- [giggles]

07:10.998 --> 07:13.634
[laughter]

07:13.667 --> 07:15.569
- WHAT?

07:15.603 --> 07:18.839
- SORRY, BRIAN.
IT'S SWEET, IT REALLY IS,

07:18.872 --> 07:23.443
BUT THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS
SERENDIPITY OR DESTINY.

07:23.477 --> 07:25.112
- WHAT, YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT
IS WAS SERENDIPITY

07:25.145 --> 07:26.146
THAT YOU MET JOHNNY?

07:26.179 --> 07:28.415
- [laughs]
NO.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.851
NOT REALLY, I MEAN...

07:30.884 --> 07:34.955
OBVIOUSLY I LOVE HIM, BUT IT'S
NOT DESTINY THAT WE MET.

07:34.988 --> 07:36.590
- I THINK IT WAS.

07:36.624 --> 07:38.325
- BULLSH--.
- I DO.

07:38.358 --> 07:40.528
I THINK WE WERE DESTINED.
- OH, THAT'S SO SWEET.

07:40.561 --> 07:42.930
- IT IS SWEET, 'CAUSE I'M SWEET.
YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER

07:42.963 --> 07:45.999
THE FIRST MOMENT I SAW HER.
I SAID TO MYSELF

07:46.033 --> 07:48.368
"OH, SH--, I'M GONNA FALL IN
LOVE WITH THIS GIRL."

07:48.401 --> 07:49.803
- WHAT'D YOU THINK WHEN YOU
SAW JOHNNY?

07:49.837 --> 07:53.841
"HOLY SH--, THIS GUY'S GONNA
HIT ON ME."

07:53.874 --> 07:55.809
- I WENT HOME WITH THIS JEWISH
GUY A FEW WEEKS AGO,

07:55.843 --> 07:57.678
AND RIGHT BEFORE WE ARE
ABOUT TO GET BUSY

07:57.711 --> 07:59.947
HE TELLS ME I'M HIS "BASHERT."

07:59.980 --> 08:01.882
THAT'S THE HEBREW WORD FOR
"DESTINY."

08:01.915 --> 08:05.118
- WHOA, THAT'S KIND OF INTENSE.
WHAT DO YOU EVEN SAY TO THAT?

08:05.152 --> 08:07.555
- I LOOKED HIM DEEP IN THE EYES
AND I TOLD HIM

08:07.588 --> 08:09.790
TO BUH-SHUT THE HELL UP AND
BUH-HIT IT FROM BUH-HIND.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.626
[laughter]
- I DO NOT NEED TO PICTURE THAT.

08:12.660 --> 08:15.228
- I THINK IT WAS SERENDIPITY
THAT MAEVE AND I MET.

08:15.262 --> 08:16.630
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT, T.

08:16.664 --> 08:18.231
I WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE
A DIFFERENT PARTNER,

08:18.265 --> 08:20.668
BUT THEN HE GOT WEST NILE
DISEASE, WHICH IS SAD BECAUSE

08:20.701 --> 08:23.003
THE DUDE HADN'T EVEN BEEN
TO EGYPT.

08:23.036 --> 08:25.739
AND THEN THEY GAVE ME YOU,
AND I MET YOUR SISTER.

08:25.773 --> 08:28.008
I ACTUALLY DATED MY LAST
PARTNER'S SISTER TOO,

08:28.041 --> 08:30.644
BUT I DEFINITELY DO NOT THINK
THAT WAS SERENDIPITY.

08:30.678 --> 08:33.681
THAT GIRL WAS CRAZY,
LIKE BAD CRAZY.

08:33.714 --> 08:36.917
NOT GOOD CRAZY,
LIKE YOUR SISTER, T.

08:36.950 --> 08:40.220
OH, MAN, MAEVE LETS ME DO SOME
STUFF TO HER, T.

08:40.253 --> 08:41.488
- THAT'S TOO MUCH.

08:41.521 --> 08:42.890
- YEAH, SOMETIMES IT IS
TOO MUCH.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.692
I THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED
A SAFE WORD.

08:44.725 --> 08:46.359
- BILLY.
- NO, I THINK "BILLY"

08:46.393 --> 08:49.429
WOULD BE A VERY CONFUSING
SAFE WORD, T.

08:49.462 --> 08:51.765
- ALL I KNOW IS, YOU'LL DRIVE
YOURSELF CRAZY

08:51.799 --> 08:54.568
TRYING TO FIND MEANING IN EVERY
LITTLE EVENT.

08:54.602 --> 08:57.370
- CASH IS RIGHT.
YOU'LL FIND SERENDIPITY

08:57.404 --> 08:59.106
EVERYWHERE IF YOU LOOK
HARD ENOUGH.

08:59.139 --> 09:01.742
AND BY "SERENDIPITY,"
I MEAN THIS DRAG QUEEN I KNOW.

09:01.775 --> 09:04.778
SERIOUSLY, DRIVE ANYWHERE DOWN
ROSCOE ON A SATURDAY NIGHT,

09:04.812 --> 09:06.279
YOU CAN'T MISS HER.
SHE'S LIKE 6'7".

09:06.313 --> 09:07.615
- I KNOW THAT GIRL!

09:07.648 --> 09:09.282
SHE'S ALWAYS GOT SUCH
GREAT SHOES.

09:09.316 --> 09:12.119
- YOU SHOULD TELL HER THAT.
SHE'S ACTUALLY WEIRDLY INSECURE.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.721
- NO, SHE'S GORGEOUS.

09:13.754 --> 09:16.757
- LOOK, MAN, DESTINY, FATE,
ALL THAT STUFF IS JUST A WAY

09:16.790 --> 09:19.126
TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL LIKE LIFE
MAKES SENSE.

09:19.159 --> 09:22.229
- SO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT
LIFE IS JUST A RANDOM SERIES

09:22.262 --> 09:25.465
OF UNCONNECTED EVENTS THAT ARE
ULTIMATELY MEANINGLESS?

09:25.498 --> 09:27.768
[over loudspeaker]
- YES.

09:29.469 --> 09:32.740
YOU GUYS HEAR ME?
HELLO?

09:40.814 --> 09:43.416
- DO YOU THINK IT'S WEIRD THAT
THERESA DOESN'T THINK

09:43.450 --> 09:44.451
MEETING ME WAS DESTINY?

09:44.484 --> 09:46.553
- [laughs]

09:46.586 --> 09:47.988
OH, SH--, I KNEW THIS
WAS HAPPENING.

09:48.021 --> 09:49.122
- WHAT?

09:49.156 --> 09:51.258
NOT THAT I BELIEVE ANY OF THAT
CRAP, BUT...

09:51.291 --> 09:52.726
I MEAN, SHOULDN'T SHE?

09:52.760 --> 09:54.427
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CALL
CHICKS WHO TELL MEN THAT

09:54.461 --> 09:56.396
THEY'RE DESTINED TO BE TOGETHER
THE FIRST TIME THEY MEET?

09:56.429 --> 09:57.965
- YEAH, THEY CALL 'EM
PSYCHOPATHS.

09:57.998 --> 10:00.300
- THAT'S RIGHT, JOHN.
THEY CALL THEM PSYCHOPATHS.

10:00.333 --> 10:01.969
AND "THEY" ARE NOT WRONG.

10:02.002 --> 10:04.404
- IT'S JUST THAT I'VE NEVER
LIVED WITH ANYBODY BEFORE,

10:04.437 --> 10:09.276
AND IT'D BE NICE IF THERESA WAS
JUST A LITTLE MORE...

10:09.309 --> 10:10.410
ROMANTIC ABOUT IT.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.945
- OH!
- OH, HO HO.

10:11.979 --> 10:15.115
SO JUST BECAUSE YOU TWO MOVED IN
TOGETHER,

10:15.148 --> 10:18.018
YOU WANT HER TO BELIEVE A BUNCH
OF PRINCE CHARMING, FAIRY DUST,

10:18.051 --> 10:20.453
GLASS SLIPPER BULLSH-- YOU DON'T
EVEN BELIEVE?

10:20.487 --> 10:23.991
UNLESS YOU ACTUALLY, SECRETLY DO
BELIEVE YOU'RE DESTINED TO BE

10:24.024 --> 10:26.459
TOGETHER AND YOU WERE HURT,
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T.

10:26.493 --> 10:28.962
- NO.
- DON'T--DON'T FIGHT IT, JOHN.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.864
YOU COULD BE SO HAPPY.
EMBRACE IT.

10:30.898 --> 10:32.432
- MM-HMM.
- IT WANTS TO BE HELD.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.167
- HILARIOUS, YOU WANT EVERYBODY
TO THINK THAT YOU'RE

10:34.201 --> 10:37.370
A TOUGH GUY, BUT ALL YOU REALLY
WANT ARE YOUR FAIRY TALES.

10:37.404 --> 10:40.708
- AMBULANCE NEEDED,
739 EAST ADAMS.

10:40.741 --> 10:44.211
- AMBULANCE 14 RESPONDING.
OOH!

10:44.244 --> 10:48.716
WHAT IF IT'S RAPUNZEL?
YOU CAN WAKE HER UP WITH A KISS.

10:48.749 --> 10:50.283
- IT'S SLEEPING BEAUTY
YOU WAKE UP WITH A KISS.

10:50.317 --> 10:51.985
RAPUNZEL'S THE ONE IN THE TOWER
WITH THE HAIR.

10:52.019 --> 10:53.186
- WELL, YOU'D KNOW
THE DIFFERENCE.

10:56.523 --> 10:59.893
- T, T BABY, I CAN'T TAKE ALL
THIS TRAFFIC.

10:59.927 --> 11:02.162
- WHAT TRAFFIC?
18TH IS WIDE OPEN.

11:02.195 --> 11:04.965
- THIS TRAFFIC IN MY HEAD, T.
IT'S MENTAL GRIDLOCK.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.800
THIS SERENDIPITY STUFF HAS GOT
ME THINKING.

11:06.834 --> 11:09.236
- OH, DON'T DO THAT, SWEETIE.
- IT'S LIKE--

11:09.269 --> 11:11.471
IT'S LIKE EVERYTHING THAT
HAPPENS IN LIFE

11:11.504 --> 11:14.875
AFFECTS EVERY OTHER THING
IN LIFE.

11:14.908 --> 11:17.644
I MEAN, IF WE DIDN'T MAKE
THE LIGHT BACK THERE,

11:17.677 --> 11:21.314
WHERE WOULD WE BE RIGHT NOW?

11:21.348 --> 11:22.883
- AT THE LIGHT.
- MAYBE!

11:22.916 --> 11:24.651
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW THAT!

11:24.684 --> 11:28.655
- WELL, YEAH, ACTUALLY I DO.
- OR--OR YOU DON'T.

11:28.688 --> 11:33.326
SEE?
SEE?

11:33.360 --> 11:35.062
- YEAH, NO, I DON'T SEE.

11:35.095 --> 11:38.932
- THAT'S THE THING, T.
NOBODY SEES.

11:38.966 --> 11:41.701
OH, NO.
OH NO, I'M FREAKING OUT.

11:41.735 --> 11:43.670
- OH, OKAY, DEEP BREATHS.
HEY--

11:43.703 --> 11:46.339
- I'M FREAKING OUT,
I GOTTA CLEAR MY HEAD.

11:46.373 --> 11:51.344
[silently working his jaw]

11:51.378 --> 11:54.748
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, IT JUST
OPENS UP MY HEAD TUNNELS.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.523
all: OH!

12:03.556 --> 12:05.425
CARL FAINTED.
HE HIT THE GROUND HARD.

12:05.458 --> 12:06.626
I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT HIM.

12:06.659 --> 12:08.061
- I THINK YOU MIGHT BE
IN SHOCK, SIR.

12:08.095 --> 12:10.130
- NAH, I THINK IT LOOKS WORSE
THAN IT IS.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.065
HAD SOME BAD SHELLFISH DOWN IN
FLORIDA ONCE.

12:12.099 --> 12:15.102
THAT HURT WAY WORSE.
CARL!

12:15.135 --> 12:16.870
THESE MEN ARE HERE TO HELP YOU.

12:16.904 --> 12:19.072
- SIR, SIR, I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO JUST STAY STILL.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.774
- SIR, CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED?

12:20.808 --> 12:23.243
- IT WAS AMAZING.
I'M DOWN HERE LAYING SHEETROCK.

12:23.276 --> 12:26.780
I HEAR TIM FROM FIVE STORIES UP
YELL "HEY MIKE, WATCH OUT!"

12:26.814 --> 12:28.715
SO I LOOK UP AND THEN,
[swish]

12:28.748 --> 12:31.118
SIX FEET OF REBAR GOES RIGHT
THROUGH ME.

12:31.151 --> 12:34.387
AND THEN, I'M LIKE "HOLY SH--!
TIM, YOU SEE THIS?"

12:34.421 --> 12:37.124
AND THEN CARL RUNS OVER AND
HE'S ALL "SEE WHAT?"

12:37.157 --> 12:39.960
AND THEN BOOM,
CARL'S OUT COLD.

12:39.993 --> 12:42.662
- SIR, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
TAKE YOU TO THE HOSPITAL.

12:42.695 --> 12:45.332
- MIKE, IT'S BAD,
IT'S REALLY BAD.

12:45.365 --> 12:48.001
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
THIS IS MY LUCKY DAY!

12:48.035 --> 12:51.771
THE CITY OWNS THIS BUILDING.
I'M GETTING PAID!

12:51.805 --> 12:53.606
CARL, WE'RE ALL GOING DOWN TO
THE ISLANDS,

12:53.640 --> 12:54.975
WE'RE OPENING UP A BAR.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.910
HEY, YOU HEAR THAT, TIMMY?

12:56.944 --> 12:59.847
- CALL IT THE REBAR.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.349
- BINGO!
THIS GUY DRINKS FOR FREE.

13:02.382 --> 13:04.617
- OKAY, WE'RE GONNA--MIKE, WE'RE
GONNA GET YOU ON THE RIG.

13:04.651 --> 13:06.786
- BE STILL.
- REAL SLOW.

13:06.820 --> 13:07.855
[all talking at once]

13:07.888 --> 13:09.756
- NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO, NO.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.791
[muttering]
NUH-NUH-OH--

13:11.825 --> 13:14.461
HE FAINTED AGAIN.
HE FAINTED--HE FAINTED AGAIN.

13:16.063 --> 13:19.499
- A LOT OF MONEY, YOU KNOW?
SERIOUS PAYDAY, HEY!

13:19.532 --> 13:22.102
STROKE!
STROKE!

13:22.135 --> 13:24.271
[laughing]
I'M JUST HAVING FUN.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.939
HEY GUYS, I DON'T HAVE
INSURANCE,

13:25.973 --> 13:27.474
BUT THE CITY'S PICKING UP
THE BILL,

13:27.507 --> 13:30.777
ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHER BILLS
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE!

13:30.810 --> 13:33.480
[laughs]
HEY, WHAT'S THE FOOD SITCH HERE?

13:33.513 --> 13:37.284
- OH, YOU'RE GONNA GET FOOD.
- WOW, THIS IS A BIG HOSPITAL!

13:37.317 --> 13:38.952
COULD I GET A MAP FOR WHEN
I WAKE UP?

13:38.986 --> 13:41.388
- CLEAR THE HALLS!
CLEAR THE HALLS

13:41.421 --> 13:42.856
- SEE YA.

13:44.024 --> 13:46.026
- FEELING BETTER, BUD?
- MM-HMM, OH YEAH,

13:46.059 --> 13:47.460
JUST NEEDED MY MEDICINE.
MIRA, MUCHACHO.

13:47.494 --> 13:50.430
[speaking Spanish]

13:57.404 --> 13:59.506
ES UNA--
HOLY SH--.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.909
T!
T, CHECK IT OUT, RINOCERONTE.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.043
- [gasps]
OH.

14:03.076 --> 14:04.978
HE MISSED HIS COURT DATE
LAST WEEK.

14:05.012 --> 14:07.214
I AM GONNA ENJOY CUFFING THAT
SON OF A BITCH!

14:07.247 --> 14:09.482
- OH, MY GOD, IF WE HADN'T
STOPPED TO GET MY ICY GULP,

14:09.516 --> 14:11.551
WE NEVER WOULD HAVE SEEN HIM.
- YEAH, OR WE WOULD HAVE SEEN

14:11.584 --> 14:14.888
HIM AND HIS BIG NOSE EATING THAT
BURRITO THROUGH THE CAR WINDOW.

14:14.922 --> 14:16.423
- NAH, I DON'T THINK SO, T.
WEATHER CONDITIONS,

14:16.456 --> 14:18.425
LOW VISIBILITY, WE AIN'T GOT
NO SUNGLASSES--

14:18.458 --> 14:20.093
- SH--, SH--, SH--, SH--!
- THIS IS SEREN--YO.

14:20.127 --> 14:22.229
COME ON, MAN--
MIRA.

14:22.262 --> 14:23.830
[speaking Spanish]

14:23.863 --> 14:25.999
YOU CAN HAVE ONE SIP.
UN SIP--NO, NOT--

14:26.033 --> 14:27.867
NOT WITH ME STANDING
RIGHT HERE, BRO!

14:29.136 --> 14:30.770
- YOU'RE NEVER GONNA FINISH
THAT BURRITO!

14:30.803 --> 14:32.105
[mouth full]
- YES, I AM!

14:32.139 --> 14:33.273
- THEY GOT REALLY GOOD BURRITOS
THERE, T!

14:33.306 --> 14:35.909
WE GOTTA GO BACK SOMETIME.
- OKAY!

14:41.248 --> 14:43.450
- CHEER UP, AL, AT LEAST YOU
STILL GOT YOUR BALLS!

14:43.483 --> 14:45.018
- FRANK.
- HEY, PAL!

14:45.052 --> 14:46.686
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- OH, WELL, I'M BASICALLY HERE

14:46.719 --> 14:49.289
ALL THE TIME, DAD.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

14:49.322 --> 14:51.624
- VISITING A BUDDY OF MINE.
GOT THE ASS CANCER.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.793
HEY, HOW OLD ARE YOU, KID?

14:53.826 --> 14:55.728
- 33.
- NO SH--?

14:55.762 --> 14:57.364
- YEP.
- WELL, OKAY.

14:57.397 --> 15:00.033
SEVEN YEARS, YOU START HAVING
YOUR ASS CHECKED.

15:00.067 --> 15:01.768
- CHECK THIS SH-- OUT, GUYS.

15:01.801 --> 15:03.436
- HEY, AUGGIE, WHAT'S UP?

15:03.470 --> 15:05.072
THIS SON OF A BITCH IS SO LUCKY,
I'M SURPRISED WE DIDN'T FIND

15:05.105 --> 15:07.807
A HORSESHOE UP HIS ASS.
- IT HIT NOTHING!

15:07.840 --> 15:09.209
- NOTHING.
- JESUS.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.444
- THAT'S SO COOL.
- HERE, KEEP IT.

15:11.478 --> 15:14.314
SHOW IT TO YOUR FRIENDS.
PULL IT OUT AT PARTIES.

15:14.347 --> 15:15.949
- DID YOU GUYS SEE THAT DUDE
WITH THE REBAR?

15:15.983 --> 15:17.450
- YEAH, WE BROUGHT HIM IN.
- NO WAY!

15:17.484 --> 15:20.120
- WE GOT THE X-RAY RIGHT HERE.
- HOLY SH--!

15:20.153 --> 15:21.955
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD GET HIM
TO SIGN IT FOR ME?

15:21.989 --> 15:24.224
- HEY GUYS, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BELIEVE WHAT'S HAPPENED.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.993
[all saying they know about
the rebar guy]

15:26.026 --> 15:27.961
- OKAY, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
THE X-RAY.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.262
THAT DRIVER Y'ALL BROUGHT IN?

15:29.296 --> 15:31.098
THE ONE WHO CLIPPED
THE ROLLER SKATER?

15:31.131 --> 15:33.400
THEY FOUND A MASSIVE TUMOR ON
HIS SPINE DURING THE MRI.

15:33.433 --> 15:34.801
- WHOA.
- GET OUT.

15:34.834 --> 15:36.269
- IT WOULD HAVE SPREAD IF THEY
DIDN'T CATCH IT.

15:36.303 --> 15:37.937
SO THAT CRASH SAVED HIS LIFE.

15:37.971 --> 15:39.672
RECKLESS DICKHEAD.

15:39.706 --> 15:42.142
- WAIT, SO YOU GUYS WERE SAVED
BY THE ROLLER SKATER,

15:42.175 --> 15:43.843
THE DRIVER WAS SAVED BY
THE CRASH.

15:43.876 --> 15:46.113
THAT'S TWO SERENDIPITIES
IN ONE EVENT.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.814
SOMETHING IS GOING ON HERE.

15:47.847 --> 15:50.783
- PLUS, WE HAD THE REBAR MAN,
AND THEN I HAPPENED TO SHOW UP.

15:50.817 --> 15:53.120
- OH, WE ARE IN A SERENDIPITY
VORTEX.

15:53.153 --> 15:55.955
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS, BUT
WE ARE IN A MAJOR HOT STREAK!

15:55.989 --> 15:57.790
- THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
A SERENDIPITY VORTEX IS.

15:57.824 --> 15:59.592
- WE GOTTA FIND A WAY TO
PARLAY THIS!

15:59.626 --> 16:01.861
- I WOULD JUST LIKE TO GO ON
RECORD AS SAYING THAT I THINK

16:01.894 --> 16:03.796
THIS IS ALL BULLSH--.
BUT I ALSO THINK

16:03.830 --> 16:06.133
WE SHOULD GO BUY LOTTERY TICKETS
IMMEDIATELY.

16:06.166 --> 16:07.967
- THAT'S IT, KID!
YOU'RE A GENIUS!

16:08.001 --> 16:09.969
- WE GOT SEVEN MINUTES TO MAKE
IT TO POWERBALL.

16:10.003 --> 16:11.804
- THERE'S A LIQUOR STORE ON
OGDEN AND ROOSEVELT.

16:11.838 --> 16:13.773
- LET'S GO!

16:13.806 --> 16:15.442
HOLY SH--, WE'RE GONNA WIN
THIS THING.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.409
- STAT!

16:21.414 --> 16:23.316
- HOW GOOD IS THAT BURRITO,
BILLY?

16:23.350 --> 16:24.817
- OH, IT'S SO GOOD.
- MM-HMM.

16:24.851 --> 16:27.120
- COME ON, DAWG.
- COME ON, DAWG!

16:27.154 --> 16:28.721
YOU KNOW HOW GOOD THEY ARE.

16:28.755 --> 16:29.689
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO
TASTE IT?

16:29.722 --> 16:31.291
- NO, I TRUST YOU.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.126
- YO, I'M ONLY GONNA EAT UP TO

16:33.160 --> 16:34.961
ABOUT AN INCH AWAY FROM YOUR
BITE MARK.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.363
- THEN YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME
THE REST?

16:36.396 --> 16:38.631
- HELL NO, THEN I'M GONNA THROW
IT OUT, BITCH.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.300
[both chuckling]

16:40.333 --> 16:42.635
YO...I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHY
I WAS FREAKING OUT SO MUCH

16:42.669 --> 16:43.836
ABOUT SERENDIPITY.

16:43.870 --> 16:46.406
SERENDIPITY'S ABSOLUTELY
FANTASTIC.

16:46.439 --> 16:49.476
LED US TO THIS DUDE WE'VE BEEN
AFTER, AND I GOT FREE FOOD.

16:49.509 --> 16:53.346
- HEY, HECTOR, WHY'D YOU SKIP
OUT ON YOUR COURT DATE?

16:53.380 --> 16:55.982
- MET A GIRL, YO.
- YEAH, BUT YOU GOT YOURSELF

16:56.015 --> 16:58.085
ANOTHER THREE MONTHS MANDATORY,
DUDE.

16:58.118 --> 17:00.353
- THAT'S NOTHING, MAMA.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.422
SHE'S MY DESTINY.
THREE MONTHS?

17:02.455 --> 17:05.225
[scoffs]
I'M TALKING ABOUT ETERNITY.

17:05.258 --> 17:08.428
- MIRA, HERE.
HERE SHE IS, MIRA, CHECK IT.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.597
- OH, MAN, SHE'S REALLY PRETTY,
BRO.

17:10.630 --> 17:13.666
- UCH.
WHY ARE MEN SUCH SAPS?

17:13.700 --> 17:15.768
- WELL, I CAN'T SPEAK FOR EVERY
MAN, THOUGH I HAVE GIVEN THIS

17:15.802 --> 17:18.438
A LOT OF THOUGHT, AS SOCIETY'S
AFFORDED ME THE OPPORTUNITY

17:18.471 --> 17:22.041
ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS,
AND THIS IS WHAT I DECIDED.

17:22.075 --> 17:24.611
THERE'S SO MANY BEAUTIFUL WOMEN
IN THIS WORLD

17:24.644 --> 17:27.080
THAT WHEN A MAN COMMITS TO ONE,
IT IS NECESSARY FOR HIM

17:27.114 --> 17:31.050
TO BELIEVE THAT HE FOUND
HIS DESTINY.

17:31.084 --> 17:32.452
OTHERWISE, HE WOULD BE POWERLESS

17:32.485 --> 17:36.456
IN THE FACE OF SO MANY,
MANY VAGINAS.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.127
- DAMN.
YOU HEARD THAT, T?

17:40.160 --> 17:43.296
- YEAH.
ACTUALLY KINDA MAKES SENSE.

17:43.330 --> 17:47.634
- MM-HMM.
- ALL RIGHT, BILLY.

17:47.667 --> 17:50.069
GO ON.
- WHAT?

17:50.103 --> 17:52.105
- GIVE HIM A BITE OF
THE BURRITO.

17:52.139 --> 17:53.573
[both silently mouthing words]

17:53.606 --> 17:56.609
- COME ON.
- NO.

17:58.077 --> 18:03.316
- ONE...TWO...
- HERE, MAN.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.320
- THAT'S WEIRD.
- VORTEX!

18:07.354 --> 18:08.655
I'M TELLING YOU,
IF WE WIN THIS THING,

18:08.688 --> 18:10.690
I'M BANNING THE WORD "VORTEX."

18:13.360 --> 18:14.961
- LET ME PICK THE NUMBERS.
- THERE'S NO TIME.

18:14.994 --> 18:16.329
- QUICK PICK THAT SH--.

18:16.363 --> 18:18.465
- MAY WE HAVE SEVEN POWERBALL
TICKETS, PLEASE?

18:18.498 --> 18:19.466
- NO.
- WHAT?

18:19.499 --> 18:21.100
- WHAT?

18:21.134 --> 18:23.303
- IT'S AFTER 6:00.
CAN'T SELL TICKETS AFTER 6:00.

18:23.336 --> 18:24.971
- IT'S 6:02,
WE'RE ONLY TWO MINUTES LATE.

18:25.004 --> 18:26.473
- AND WE ARE IN A VORTEX, SIR!

18:26.506 --> 18:28.408
- TWO MINUTES, OH,
IS TWO MINUTES.

18:28.441 --> 18:29.942
- HOW CAN YOU EVEN TRUST
THAT TIME?

18:29.976 --> 18:31.411
IS IT SET TO THE ATOMIC CLOCK?

18:31.444 --> 18:33.313
- YES, THE VICE PRESIDENT CALLS
ME EVERY MORNING,

18:33.346 --> 18:35.114
AND WE COORDINATE OUR CLOCKS.

18:35.148 --> 18:36.449
- COME ON, SIR,
CUT US SOME SLACK!

18:36.483 --> 18:38.318
- NO CAN DO.

18:38.351 --> 18:39.619
- YOU'RE GONNA DO IT, CUPCAKE.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.288
YOU'RE GONNA GET ON YOUR
LITTLE MACHINE,

18:41.321 --> 18:42.689
YOU'RE GONNA DO YOUR LITTLE
TYPEY TYPEY,

18:42.722 --> 18:44.424
AND YOU'RE GONNA SPIT OUT OUR
WINNING TICKETS,

18:44.457 --> 18:46.826
OR YOU'RE NOT GONNA SEE 6:03!

18:46.859 --> 18:49.462
- FINE.
FINE.

18:49.496 --> 18:51.798
- YEAH, GOOD.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

18:51.831 --> 18:55.302
- HERE ARE SEVEN TICKETS FOR
NEXT WEEK'S POWERBALL.

18:55.335 --> 18:56.936
- YOU SON OF A BITCH!
I'LL KILL YOU.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.471
- HEY!
IT'S MORGAN DAVIES.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.473
- OH, THAT'S THAT CHICK WE
HELPED, TURN THIS UP.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.609
- NO, CAN'T.
STORE POLICY.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.044
- GIVE ME THAT!

19:05.077 --> 19:06.713
- GOD, SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.
- I KNOW.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.615
- BUT WE REALLY NEVER WOULD HAVE
WON IF IT WASN'T FOR THOSE EMTS

19:08.648 --> 19:11.351
WHO STITCHED ME UP THIS MORNING.
MY FOOT'S FEELING GREAT, GUYS,

19:11.384 --> 19:14.687
SO THANKS FOR THAT,
AND I'LL TAKE YOU OUT TO DINNER.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.122
- OH!
- THAT'S RIGHT, SEE?

19:16.155 --> 19:17.190
- HEY GUYS, YOU KNOW WHAT
THIS MEANS?

19:17.224 --> 19:18.825
MEANS THAT WE'RE STILL HOT!

19:18.858 --> 19:22.295
GIVE US ALL YOUR SCRATCHERS,
YOU SMUG LITTLE COCK-KNOCKER!

19:22.329 --> 19:23.330
NOW!

19:33.706 --> 19:35.708
- HEY.
- HEY.

19:41.248 --> 19:42.649
- SO.
- HMM.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.484
- I'VE BEEN GIVING THIS A LOT
OF THOUGHT--

19:44.517 --> 19:45.852
- HEY, BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING,
WOULD YOU TAKE SOME OF THESE?

19:45.885 --> 19:48.355
MY DAD WENT NUTS TODAY.
- YEAH.

19:50.623 --> 19:54.361
I KNOW HOW HARD THE IDEA OF
A LIFELONG COMMITMENT CAN BE,

19:54.394 --> 19:57.430
AND IF YOU NEED TO BELIEVE THERE
IS SOMETHING BIGGER OUT THERE

19:57.464 --> 20:00.267
THAT SOMEHOW PREDETERMINES THAT
WE ARE MEANT TO BE TOGETHER,

20:00.300 --> 20:02.068
THEN I'M NOT GONNA MAKE FUN OF
YOU, OKAY?

20:02.101 --> 20:03.436
I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S KIND
OF SWEET.

20:03.470 --> 20:05.605
- LISTEN, OKAY, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO FOR MY SAKE--

20:05.638 --> 20:08.207
- NO, I DO, AND JUST BECAUSE
I DON'T BELIEVE IN FATE,

20:08.241 --> 20:10.610
DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T TRUST
MY INSTINCTS.

20:10.643 --> 20:13.112
I KNOW THAT YOU ARE THE RIGHT
GUY FOR ME.

20:13.145 --> 20:15.014
- HOLY SH--!

20:15.047 --> 20:17.617
250 BUCKS!
[laughs]

20:17.650 --> 20:18.918
- WE WON?

20:18.951 --> 20:20.019
- TELL ME THAT'S NOT
SERENDIPITY!

20:20.052 --> 20:22.889
- NO, BUT--

20:22.922 --> 20:24.391
I MEAN, WHO CARES, RIGHT?

20:24.424 --> 20:27.260
LET'S JUST GO TO A FANCY
RESTAURANT AND EAT ALL THE FOOD!

20:27.294 --> 20:29.629
- YEAH, OH, NO.

20:29.662 --> 20:32.098
YOU'RE NOT A BELIEVER.

20:32.131 --> 20:33.099
I'M GONNA TAKE HANK.

20:33.132 --> 20:34.367
- HEY!
HEY, HEY, HEY.

20:34.401 --> 20:35.935
YOU GIVE ME BACK THAT SCRATCHER,
MISTER.

20:35.968 --> 20:37.637
- NO, NO, NO, NO, HANK AND I ARE
GONNA GO TO GIBSON'S.

20:37.670 --> 20:39.038
- NO!
- YES!

20:39.071 --> 20:40.940
I'LL BRING BACK LEFTOVERS!
- SERIOUSLY?

20:40.973 --> 20:42.642
- YES, OF COURSE!

20:42.675 --> 20:45.244
THE PORTIONS THERE ARE HUGE, I
CAN'T POSSIBLY FINISH ALL THAT.

20:45.278 --> 20:46.746
LISTEN, I'M GONNA BE LATE.
- REALLY?

20:46.779 --> 20:48.214
- I'LL TEXT YOU WHEN I'M--
I'M KIDDING!

20:48.247 --> 20:50.783
COME ON, WE'RE GOING!

20:50.817 --> 20:53.252
[laughing]
