WEBVTT

00:00.915 --> 00:03.315
We should probably get going.
We probably should.

00:06.253 --> 00:08.653
We're gonna go celebrate, create
some memories, all right? Want to?

00:08.722 --> 00:11.554
Yeah. That is what I'm
talking about, young man!

00:11.624 --> 00:13.285
Come on now, we're gonna celebrate.
Come on.

00:13.393 --> 00:14.451
All right.

00:14.527 --> 00:15.687
Daddy got him on a leash.

00:15.795 --> 00:18.821
I'm bringing you out here as assistant
coach, just until Matt gets back.

00:18.932 --> 00:20.331
What do you think about that?
Sure, yeah.

00:20.433 --> 00:22.663
I'm going to college.
Only Riggins to get in. I told you.

00:22.735 --> 00:24.168
I'm in because of you.
Uh-huh.

00:24.237 --> 00:26.399
Where are you?
Actually, in Dallas.

00:26.473 --> 00:28.907
Is everything all right?
Yeah. Everything's fine.

00:28.976 --> 00:31.376
I wanted to hear
a familiar voice.

00:36.316 --> 00:38.011
I'm such
an idiot, Julie.

00:38.084 --> 00:40.746
There's no possible way on Earth
that I'm gonna be able to make up

00:40.820 --> 00:42.617
everything I have to make up.

00:42.889 --> 00:44.720
I missed so much school.

00:45.391 --> 00:47.120
I'm never getting into
college at this point.

00:47.193 --> 00:48.785
Look, okay.
All you have to do

00:48.861 --> 00:50.829
is you just have to bribe your
teachers with some cupcakes,

00:50.897 --> 00:52.262
so they'll let you
make up the tests.

00:52.332 --> 00:54.060
Cupcakes? Really?

00:54.166 --> 00:56.794
And then, they're having
another SAT this Saturday.

00:56.868 --> 00:59.063
Matt's taking it,
so you just go to that SAT,

00:59.137 --> 01:02.800
get really high SAT scores and then
your GPA won't matter as much.

01:02.941 --> 01:06.433
Yeah, the problem is I suck
at tests, so there's that.

01:06.878 --> 01:09.005
So then why don't you
just get Landry to help you?

01:09.081 --> 01:11.015
It's not like he has
anything better to do.

01:12.218 --> 01:16.244
Uh, so does anyone have a plan or are we
just gonna sit here all day? 'Cause I...

01:16.321 --> 01:17.549
Let's just go
to the Alamo Freeze.

01:17.622 --> 01:18.884
We've been sitting here
for like an hour...

01:18.957 --> 01:20.322
Dude, the Alamo Freeze is gross, man.

01:20.392 --> 01:21.689
You know what?
All right, guys, I'm leaving.

01:21.760 --> 01:23.591
Hey, boy, don't touch my door.
What's wrong with you?

01:23.662 --> 01:25.323
I didn't give you permission
to leave, all right?

01:25.397 --> 01:27.695
You're not my dad.
Hey, if you say another word about your dad,

01:27.766 --> 01:29.461
I swear I'm gonna punch you in the face.
Boy, you got one.

01:29.534 --> 01:30.592
Look, man, just relax.
Hey, guys.

01:30.669 --> 01:31.795
What's up?
How you doing?

01:31.870 --> 01:34.395
Hey, I just wanna let y'all know,
Madison's parents are out of town.

01:34.473 --> 01:35.906
She's gonna have
some people over.

01:35.973 --> 01:37.770
So you all should
definitely come.

01:37.842 --> 01:39.002
Hey, who's Madison?

01:39.076 --> 01:41.135
You freaking heard.
Just shut up.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:56.427 --> 01:57.552
Excuse me.

02:03.534 --> 02:04.592
Hey.

02:05.069 --> 02:06.127
Hi.

02:07.371 --> 02:08.565
Do you want an appletini?

02:08.672 --> 02:11.732
Huh?
No, I don't drink alcohol.

02:13.344 --> 02:14.538
Yeah.
You don't?

02:15.246 --> 02:17.237
How about a glass of milk?

02:19.049 --> 02:21.415
No, you know, I'm fine.
Thank you, though.

02:21.484 --> 02:23.008
No, I insist.
No, no.

02:23.086 --> 02:24.576
You know,
this should be your thing.

02:24.654 --> 02:26.679
You know, you drink milk.

02:27.557 --> 02:33.621
You're like this young, wholesome,
milk-drinking quarterback.

02:37.300 --> 02:38.733
You have some...

02:39.935 --> 02:41.732
Huh? There's a little
bit on your lip.

02:41.804 --> 02:43.635
Just right there.

02:44.506 --> 02:45.872
There we go.

02:45.942 --> 02:47.170
Perfect.

02:54.350 --> 02:56.682
Keep them coming,
honey.

03:00.356 --> 03:01.754
I like that.

03:03.525 --> 03:04.651
You good, Buddy?

03:05.094 --> 03:06.083
Yeah.

03:06.328 --> 03:09.161
Want anything else?
No.

03:09.665 --> 03:12.156
Some chicken fingers with that little
spicy ranch sauce you like so much?

03:12.234 --> 03:16.603
What I wanna know is, when are you
gonna tell me why you brought me here?

03:16.672 --> 03:19.038
That's what I'm trying
to get to, okay? Yeah.

03:19.108 --> 03:21.133
Remember that little investment
we made a few months back?

03:21.210 --> 03:22.233
Mmm-hmm.

03:22.310 --> 03:23.902
The strip mall?
The sure thing.

03:23.978 --> 03:25.070
Yeah.

03:25.480 --> 03:26.811
It went belly-up.

03:30.184 --> 03:31.651
It's okay, though.

03:31.719 --> 03:34.689
I got a plan that's gonna put Dillon
on the map, and I want you in on it.

03:34.756 --> 03:38.157
I'm gonna give you a chance here
tonight to be my first investor.

03:38.727 --> 03:40.786
Now, you tell me right now
that this isn't so.

03:40.896 --> 03:43.159
What I come up with...
You tell me you didn't lose my $70,000.

03:43.231 --> 03:45.131
I told you three months ago...
I am gonna make you so much more.

03:45.199 --> 03:47.565
I was in this for 70 grand.
It's gonna work out.

03:47.635 --> 03:50.160
Hey, there is no such thing as a
sure thing, Garrity. You know that.

03:50.271 --> 03:52.034
Hey, you lovebirds wanna
quiet down a little bit? Damn.

03:52.106 --> 03:54.506
I'll tell you what, cowboy.
You redneck son of a bitch.

03:54.575 --> 03:56.736
Do you need silence
to watch naked women?

03:56.811 --> 03:58.904
Is that what you're saying to me?
Now...

03:58.980 --> 04:00.038
Sit down.
Now, listen.

04:00.114 --> 04:02.207
You tell me right now
that you did not steal my...

04:02.283 --> 04:04.750
You're not even gonna miss
that 70 grand, Buddy Garrity.

04:04.818 --> 04:06.115
Don't you talk to me
about that 70 grand.

04:06.186 --> 04:07.278
You gotta tell me right now...

04:07.354 --> 04:09.117
You've been coming to me and
begging for deals all year long.

04:09.189 --> 04:11.180
Are you out of your mind?
Son of a bitch!

04:17.063 --> 04:19.726
Get up! Get up,
you son of a gun.

05:31.569 --> 05:33.230
What the hell happened?

05:33.304 --> 05:38.003
You don't need to be worrying
about me and what happened right now.

05:38.076 --> 05:40.977
You need to be thinking
about Friday night, Eric.

05:41.045 --> 05:43.775
The Bisons play dirty.
Everybody knows that.

05:43.848 --> 05:46.749
And the refs don't like you,
so don't worry about me.

05:46.818 --> 05:47.978
Oh, I'm not worried about you.

05:48.052 --> 05:50.519
You know you're gonna spend the
night in here tonight, don't you?

05:50.587 --> 05:53.021
'Cause they're not
letting you out.

05:56.928 --> 05:59.795
Oh, my Lord. That is awful.

05:59.864 --> 06:00.853
I don't know, honey.

06:00.932 --> 06:04.368
He got in a fight over at the
Landing Strip or some crazy thing.

06:04.435 --> 06:06.164
I'm not quite sure what, but listen...
Oh, my Lord.

06:06.237 --> 06:07.761
Just listen to me real quick.

06:07.839 --> 06:12.036
What he wants to know, can you go over
and let Lyla know what's going on?

06:12.109 --> 06:15.670
Well, yeah. But I was supposed to pick
up Jules at Matt's house at 6:00.

06:15.746 --> 06:17.077
Could you do that?

06:17.147 --> 06:18.341
All right.
Okay.

06:18.415 --> 06:20.315
All right, honey.
I'll go over there now.

06:25.656 --> 06:27.248
Hi, Mrs. Taylor.
Hey. How are you?

06:27.324 --> 06:28.348
Good.

06:28.425 --> 06:31.417
Good, I just...
Your dad asked me to drop by,

06:31.494 --> 06:34.520
because he got himself
in a little bit of a...

06:34.964 --> 06:37.194
Little bit
of a scrape and...

06:37.266 --> 06:40.828
What do you mean? Well, I guess there
was some kind of a fight or something.

06:40.904 --> 06:42.769
A fight?
Yeah. And I think he's...

06:42.839 --> 06:44.830
What? Where?
What do you mean, a fight? With who?

06:44.908 --> 06:47.672
He was apparently in a
business meeting at the...

06:47.744 --> 06:49.439
At the Landing Strip.

06:49.513 --> 06:52.539
And, anyway, so he's gonna have
to spend the night in jail

06:52.615 --> 06:55.277
is the point. But he's fine, sweetie.
He's fine. Okay?

06:55.351 --> 06:59.310
And he was worried about you.
He wanted me to let you know. Okay?

07:00.589 --> 07:04.025
I know you're a big grown-up
girl and all of that, but...

07:04.760 --> 07:07.627
If you wanted to just come stay
with us tonight at our house,

07:07.697 --> 07:09.130
you'd be more than welcome,

07:09.198 --> 07:12.497
in case you feel like you might
like to have some family around.

07:12.568 --> 07:13.966
Okay?
Okay.

07:21.710 --> 07:23.439
I love you.

07:24.746 --> 07:26.407
I love you, too.

07:30.453 --> 07:31.681
Mmm.

07:33.789 --> 07:38.225
You should probably get up.
Your mom's gonna be here in like a half hour.

07:39.160 --> 07:41.958
Grandma and Shelly will probably
be back from the doctor soon.

07:52.407 --> 07:54.967
Let me just listen
to one more song.

07:56.110 --> 07:58.101
Yeah, we can do one more.

08:05.819 --> 08:06.911
Jules?

08:10.657 --> 08:12.147
Dad, get out!

09:12.251 --> 09:14.242
All right, that part.
That's the part where I wanted you to clap.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.083
Me to clap?
Hey.

09:17.890 --> 09:20.085
Hey, y'all.
How are you? Hello.

09:21.393 --> 09:22.485
Um...

09:23.695 --> 09:25.219
Can I talk to you for a sec?

09:26.665 --> 09:28.360
Yeah, that's...
I mean, just for...

09:28.433 --> 09:29.866
Yeah, that's fine. Just...

09:29.935 --> 09:31.197
Sorry,
it'll only take a minute.

09:31.269 --> 09:34.670
That's okay. You always just
pop up at the most random time.

09:34.739 --> 09:36.934
Yeah, you know,
you sound really good, though.

09:37.008 --> 09:39.408
Well, it's supposed to sound
a lot heavier than that.

09:39.478 --> 09:41.502
My distortion pedal's
not even working.

09:41.579 --> 09:43.979
But now is
like the first time we've...

09:44.048 --> 09:46.448
That we've really ran through
it all together, but...

09:46.517 --> 09:47.677
Cool.

09:47.751 --> 09:51.586
Look, I need to ask you
a favor. If you can.

09:52.157 --> 09:56.093
I'm taking the SATs on Saturday 'cause I
gotta get my points up by, like, 1000.

09:56.161 --> 09:59.358
And I thought it would be
better if I had a coach.

09:59.598 --> 10:03.966
And you're really good at
that, so I was just hoping...

10:04.034 --> 10:05.467
So you want me to help you out.

10:05.536 --> 10:09.028
If you could,
that would be amazing.

10:11.942 --> 10:14.604
Yeah, that's fine.
I don't see why not.

10:14.778 --> 10:17.975
Um, but I've just got band
rehearsal and practice and school.

10:18.048 --> 10:20.414
Right, of course. Yeah, you're the best.
So, besides that...

10:20.484 --> 10:22.349
You are. Thank you.

10:22.419 --> 10:24.511
No, so, then I'll call you tomorrow.
And we'll set something up.

10:24.587 --> 10:25.884
All right.
Okay.

10:25.955 --> 10:27.047
Thank you.
All right.

10:27.123 --> 10:28.112
Bye, y'all.

10:28.191 --> 10:29.556
Bye.
Bye.

10:31.060 --> 10:32.823
What?

10:32.896 --> 10:36.094
It's like you're her prostitute, right?
You're gonna help her study?

10:36.166 --> 10:38.600
Except you don't get paid.
Or laid.

10:39.470 --> 10:41.028
Seriously. DRUMMER: Hey, are
we ever gonna get a gig?

10:49.846 --> 10:52.076
Look, I'm sorry about your dad.

10:53.383 --> 10:54.407
Really.

10:54.751 --> 10:57.686
Do you want to talk
about it at all? I mean...

10:57.754 --> 10:59.688
It's okay. Thank you.

11:04.661 --> 11:05.650
Um...

11:06.361 --> 11:10.627
But just a heads-up. There might be
some drama with my parents tonight.

11:11.199 --> 11:12.791
Okay. Why?

11:13.068 --> 11:14.968
Well, Matt and I were...

11:16.705 --> 11:20.436
What? We were doing stuff and
then my dad came in, and...

11:20.542 --> 11:24.604
Like, making out doing stuff
or, like, doing stuff?

11:26.149 --> 11:29.481
You did it? Like, well, it
was like afterwards and...

11:30.719 --> 11:32.482
Then my dad walked in and...

11:32.554 --> 11:33.646
Wow.

11:34.289 --> 11:36.189
Yeah.
Welcome to my world.

11:52.440 --> 11:54.431
Good Lord.

11:59.614 --> 12:02.981
I found Matt and Julie in bed
together this afternoon.

12:07.622 --> 12:08.714
What?

12:11.025 --> 12:14.483
I found Julie and Matt in bed
together this afternoon.

12:16.664 --> 12:17.653
Where?

12:18.099 --> 12:21.296
Over at Matt's house
when I went to pick Julie up.

12:23.404 --> 12:24.564
Where was that grandmother?

12:24.639 --> 12:26.834
I don't know where she was.
What were they doing?

12:26.907 --> 12:28.841
Honey, they were in bed
together. It was very obvious.

12:28.909 --> 12:31.308
Oh, honey, oh, honey.
You walked in?

12:31.378 --> 12:32.970
What did you do?

12:33.480 --> 12:35.641
What did I do? I went outside and
waited for Julie to come outside.

12:35.715 --> 12:36.807
That's what I did.

12:41.521 --> 12:43.614
I'm gonna go talk to her.

12:44.224 --> 12:45.953
Before you go in there
and talk to her,

12:46.026 --> 12:48.620
you better know
what you're gonna say.

12:56.301 --> 12:57.826
I have no idea.

13:00.940 --> 13:03.170
What are you doing?

13:03.243 --> 13:06.735
Just trying to see how long
they're gonna ground me for.

13:09.749 --> 13:12.115
Well, at least
they have another daughter.

13:13.652 --> 13:15.244
Sorry, bad joke.

13:23.395 --> 13:25.795
Matt seems like
a really nice guy.

13:26.832 --> 13:30.768
Yeah, no. It's not the problem.
He's a great guy. It's...

13:33.472 --> 13:36.372
I just feel like
everything's different now.

13:38.443 --> 13:41.173
Like I'm not Daddy's
little girl anymore.

13:43.414 --> 13:44.541
Yeah.

14:00.398 --> 14:01.456
Hey.

14:01.699 --> 14:02.688
Hi.

14:07.071 --> 14:10.802
So your dad told me about what
happened at Matt's last night.

14:12.810 --> 14:13.970
Great.

14:16.880 --> 14:18.814
Is there anything
you want to say?

14:20.417 --> 14:22.351
He should have knocked.

14:23.086 --> 14:25.782
All right, well,
I don't like your tone.

14:27.791 --> 14:30.487
You know, I'd like to be able to have
a conversation with you about it.

14:30.560 --> 14:32.995
So then,
let's have a conversation.

14:33.631 --> 14:34.723
Okay.

14:35.299 --> 14:37.028
Well, I don't really
know what to say.

14:37.100 --> 14:40.467
I don't really know how to
have a conversation about it.

14:40.537 --> 14:43.131
You know, it's disconcerting.

14:43.640 --> 14:44.732
I don't know, Jules.

14:44.808 --> 14:47.902
Why don't you just tell me
what my punishment is?

14:49.379 --> 14:53.213
Your punishment is you're gonna have to
have a conversation with me about it.

14:53.283 --> 14:55.217
Let's go to school, come on.

14:55.285 --> 14:56.752
You do realize I'm 17, right?

14:56.820 --> 14:58.411
I know how old you are.

14:58.587 --> 15:02.250
Buddy Garrity, you have been
charged with drunk and disorderly,

15:02.324 --> 15:07.057
assault and battery, and
inflicting $30,000 of damage

15:07.129 --> 15:08.960
to the Landing Strip.

15:09.031 --> 15:10.498
How do you plead?

15:10.566 --> 15:12.329
Not guilty, Your Honor.

15:12.401 --> 15:14.528
Bail is set at $10,000.

15:33.556 --> 15:35.524
Hi!
Hi! Is J.D. home?

15:37.660 --> 15:39.025
I'm sorry.

15:39.094 --> 15:40.822
You must be Mrs. McCoy.

15:40.895 --> 15:42.829
I'm Madison.
It's really nice to meet you.

15:42.897 --> 15:43.989
Well, nice to meet you.

15:44.065 --> 15:45.157
You have
a beautiful house.

15:45.233 --> 15:47.292
Oh, thank you.

15:47.368 --> 15:50.633
I know J.D. from school, so I was just popping by.
I hope that's okay.

15:50.705 --> 15:52.798
Oh, yeah.
This is my husband.

15:52.874 --> 15:53.932
Mr. McCoy.

15:54.008 --> 15:55.908
Yeah, that's me.
Hi. Nice to meet you.

15:55.977 --> 15:58.036
And you.
So is J.D. home?

15:59.080 --> 16:00.741
Yeah, he's upstairs
studying, actually. Sure.

16:00.815 --> 16:02.372
Yeah, why don't you
just head right on up?

16:02.449 --> 16:04.110
Thank you.
I'll find my own way.

16:04.184 --> 16:06.050
All right,
yeah, it's just...

16:09.490 --> 16:11.117
Who the hell is that?

16:11.192 --> 16:14.355
Well, didn't you hear, honey?
That's Madison.

16:15.430 --> 16:17.660
"The other delegates
and him immediately accepted

16:17.732 --> 16:20.394
"the resolution drafted
by the neutral states.' '

16:20.935 --> 16:22.993
Um, "him" should be "he.' '

16:23.437 --> 16:24.870
There you go.
I'm smarter than I look.

16:24.938 --> 16:26.235
Hey, you two!

16:26.607 --> 16:27.596
Hi!
Hey.

16:27.674 --> 16:28.766
You guys working hard?

16:28.842 --> 16:29.866
Yeah.
Yeah.

16:29.943 --> 16:31.706
Landry, we're so happy
to see you back around here.

16:31.778 --> 16:33.439
We missed you,
didn't we, honey?

16:33.513 --> 16:34.980
Okay.

16:35.048 --> 16:38.211
Yeah. You know what?
While you're here, sweetie, can you take a look

16:38.285 --> 16:41.277
at the pilot light in that wall here?
I think it's out. I just...

16:41.355 --> 16:44.289
Mama, Landry is...
He's helping me right now.

16:44.857 --> 16:47.587
Well, whenever
you have a moment.

16:47.660 --> 16:49.594
There's no hurry.
See you later.

16:51.464 --> 16:53.126
Sorry about that.

16:53.634 --> 16:54.965
So, where were we?

16:56.069 --> 16:58.560
Are you gonna tell me
what happened, Dad?

16:59.406 --> 17:01.397
I had a business meeting.

17:02.209 --> 17:03.574
A business meeting
at a strip club?

17:03.644 --> 17:05.270
Yeah,
this Russell Flaherty guy.

17:05.344 --> 17:06.503
I've known him a long time,

17:06.579 --> 17:09.877
and I made an investment with him.
Deal went south

17:09.949 --> 17:12.247
and I lost all the money,
and...

17:12.484 --> 17:15.113
I lost my temper, that's all.
I lost my temper.

17:15.186 --> 17:17.280
He's swindled me for the last
time, I'll tell you that...

17:17.356 --> 17:18.755
Swindled you? I thought
it was an investment.

17:18.824 --> 17:21.122
Investment.
It was an investment.

17:21.193 --> 17:24.924
But, basically,
he just stole my money,

17:24.997 --> 17:26.429
is what he did,
but it's not something

17:26.498 --> 17:27.521
that you need to worry about.

17:27.598 --> 17:29.794
Not for me to worry about?
Dad, I just saw you get arraigned

17:29.868 --> 17:32.632
for being a crazy
drunk man at a strip club!

17:32.704 --> 17:35.537
How am I not going to worry?
I just... Please explain to me.

17:35.607 --> 17:37.131
What happened?

17:37.542 --> 17:38.531
Lyla.

17:39.845 --> 17:41.676
Listen, times have been tough.

17:41.747 --> 17:43.908
Business has not been good.

17:43.983 --> 17:46.417
So your dad took
the savings money

17:46.485 --> 17:49.146
and made a risky investment.
It was stupid.

17:49.521 --> 17:50.545
And I lost some money.

17:50.622 --> 17:53.989
I tried to get some quick cash
flow with the savings money

17:54.059 --> 17:55.048
and it didn't work out.

17:55.126 --> 17:57.390
So, basically, we're in
real big trouble. Okay.

17:57.462 --> 17:58.929
We're in big trouble.
Okay.

17:58.997 --> 18:02.660
So I'll get a job, and I'll
help out until I go to college.

18:03.201 --> 18:06.830
No big deal.
I used the college money, Lyla.

18:09.173 --> 18:11.164
The savings that we were
keeping for your college

18:11.241 --> 18:13.869
is the money
I used for the investment.

18:20.784 --> 18:21.944
Now...

18:24.722 --> 18:26.554
Honey, it doesn't mean
you're not going to college.

18:26.624 --> 18:28.751
I'll figure out
a way to do this.

18:30.394 --> 18:31.520
Lyla, don't do that.

18:31.595 --> 18:33.790
Where are you going?
You're not going anywhere.

18:33.864 --> 18:35.297
Wait a minute.
Don't do this.

18:35.366 --> 18:38.961
Don't touch... Don't.
Don't! Don't touch me!

18:41.038 --> 18:43.506
Lyla, honey,
please don't leave me.

18:55.318 --> 18:58.082
Please tell me the lesson
that you've learned.

18:58.154 --> 18:59.246
Always lock the door...

18:59.322 --> 19:02.655
When having sex with
the coach's daughter.

19:02.725 --> 19:04.784
You don't need to
announce it to everybody.

19:04.861 --> 19:06.226
Not that any of this
really matters,

19:06.295 --> 19:08.763
because as soon
as Coach sees you,

19:09.232 --> 19:12.200
that might be the end
of everything for you.

19:12.267 --> 19:15.169
I'm basically looking at a
dead man walking right now.

19:15.238 --> 19:16.603
Whatever you do, do not
look him in the eye.

19:16.672 --> 19:19.869
Hey, gentlemen, listen up.
Let me have your attention real quick.

19:21.711 --> 19:25.545
All right, we just got word on
Friday's game as far as the...

19:27.517 --> 19:29.644
We lost the appeal on the
referee is what I'm saying.

19:29.719 --> 19:31.243
Here's what
that means, gentlemen.

19:31.320 --> 19:35.619
It means we can expect a lot of missed
calls and a lot of late hits come Friday.

19:35.690 --> 19:37.885
But what we're not going to do
is we are not going to lose

19:37.959 --> 19:40.826
our tempers out there.
We will not lose our tempers out there.

19:40.896 --> 19:42.921
What we are going to do is we are
going to put our heads down,

19:42.998 --> 19:46.024
and we're going to play our
game of football. Understood?

19:46.101 --> 19:47.125
Yes, sir!

19:47.202 --> 19:49.432
You leave the officials to me.

19:52.074 --> 19:53.405
Two games.

19:53.675 --> 19:54.868
Then we're in State.

19:54.942 --> 19:56.068
Then State.

20:06.955 --> 20:08.718
"Loquacious"?

20:09.157 --> 20:12.786
Uh, overly sad?
Talk...

20:12.861 --> 20:13.850
Talkative?

20:13.929 --> 20:15.156
Yeah.
Talkative.

20:15.229 --> 20:16.253
"Lugubrious.' '"

20:16.330 --> 20:18.662
Lugubrious is overly sad.
Uh-huh.

20:19.533 --> 20:21.057
"Polyphonic.' '"

20:21.335 --> 20:23.360
I'm so bored right now, Landry.

20:23.437 --> 20:24.631
So bored.

20:26.140 --> 20:28.540
Well, I'm sorry to bore you,
but we really need to...

20:28.609 --> 20:29.667
Do you want a Coke
or something?

20:29.743 --> 20:31.802
I can make us sandwiches.
I just want a break.

20:31.879 --> 20:33.540
Let's take a break.
Well, actually, I've got

20:33.614 --> 20:35.309
band practice here
in just a few minutes.

20:35.382 --> 20:37.008
So we should probably finish
these if you want to...

20:37.083 --> 20:38.550
Can't they wait for like a half hour?
No, they can't.

20:38.618 --> 20:40.017
They can't just wait,
because I told them that...

20:40.086 --> 20:41.212
You guys cutting a record
or something?

20:41.287 --> 20:42.311
No, we're not cutting a record,

20:42.388 --> 20:44.151
but I'm not going to just...

20:44.224 --> 20:47.352
I'm not going to just ditch
them, so I can have a sandwich with you.

20:47.427 --> 20:49.658
I told you that I would help you
with your vocabulary words,

20:49.730 --> 20:51.220
and that's what I am doing.

20:51.298 --> 20:53.630
Wait, you're leaving?
Why are you getting so mad right now?

20:53.701 --> 20:55.726
I'm getting so mad, because you
keep taking advantage of me,

20:55.803 --> 20:58.362
because you know
how I feel about you, Tyra.

20:58.438 --> 21:01.669
You do. It's like it's nothing
and I just let you.

21:02.775 --> 21:03.764
So...

21:06.212 --> 21:07.907
Wait, where are you going?
This whole thing...

21:07.981 --> 21:11.678
Are you serious? Have you ever read
the book The Giving Tree, Tyra?

21:12.085 --> 21:14.019
Yeah, when
I was like five. Why?

21:14.087 --> 21:17.989
It's about this tree who loves this
boy more than anything, right?

21:18.557 --> 21:21.253
And the boy just takes and takes
and takes until there's absolutely

21:21.326 --> 21:23.351
nothing left but a stump.

21:28.534 --> 21:30.024
And I'm like the tree and
you're like the little boy.

21:30.102 --> 21:31.694
You just take and take,
and there's

21:31.770 --> 21:34.068
absolutely nothing left, Tyra.

21:34.139 --> 21:36.631
That's exactly what I
feel like, just a stump.

21:37.911 --> 21:43.075
Because this, this is not a friendship.
You're selfish. It's not a friendship, okay?

21:45.484 --> 21:46.712
Landry.

21:57.429 --> 22:00.421
I mean, do you know that the doggone
Landing Strip is charging me

22:00.498 --> 22:02.523
$30,000 for damages?

22:02.600 --> 22:05.228
$30,000! That place isn't
even worth $30,000.

22:05.303 --> 22:07.203
I don't even know
what to say about that.

22:07.271 --> 22:10.798
Listen to me, I don't even know how I'm
going to keep the condo, I'm so damn broke.

22:10.875 --> 22:12.638
Hi, thank you.

22:14.612 --> 22:17.103
You know, and Lyla,
Lyla is gone.

22:17.548 --> 22:19.038
Lyla has moved in with Riggins.

22:19.116 --> 22:22.085
God Almighty, can you imagine
what's going on over there?

22:22.153 --> 22:23.381
I mean,
I do not understand this.

22:23.454 --> 22:25.547
We are in the middle
of a family crisis

22:25.623 --> 22:27.454
and Lyla leaves in a huff.

22:27.525 --> 22:30.323
When I was in college,
I had to work my butt off.

22:30.394 --> 22:31.918
I had to work for the money.
She just expects...

22:31.996 --> 22:33.987
Can I tell you one thing?

22:36.634 --> 22:38.761
Money comes and goes, yeah.

22:39.770 --> 22:41.533
These kids of ours.

22:43.473 --> 22:45.373
That's a one-time deal.

23:09.099 --> 23:11.932
Would it be all right if we
had this conversation now?

23:13.903 --> 23:14.892
Yeah.

23:18.508 --> 23:19.634
So...

23:22.279 --> 23:23.439
Do you love Matt?

23:24.848 --> 23:26.280
I love Matt.

23:30.452 --> 23:32.113
Does he love you?

23:34.323 --> 23:35.813
Matt loves me.

23:35.891 --> 23:37.119
He does?

23:41.630 --> 23:42.824
And what about birth control?

23:42.898 --> 23:44.422
Mom, I don't want
to talk about it.

23:44.500 --> 23:46.626
Hon, that's the conversation.

23:48.002 --> 23:50.232
Yes, we're using birth control.

23:51.773 --> 23:53.741
What kind, specifically?

23:54.809 --> 23:56.971
Condoms, we're using condoms.

24:01.016 --> 24:02.278
Do you know
how to use them properly?

24:02.351 --> 24:04.012
Yes, I know how to use them.

24:04.086 --> 24:05.417
You know you have to
use them every time, right?

24:05.487 --> 24:06.579
'Cause sometimes boys try to...

24:06.655 --> 24:07.643
No, I know that.

24:07.722 --> 24:09.314
Tell you, you don't need
them all the time, but you do.

24:09.390 --> 24:11.824
Matt's really good about it.
Okay.

24:14.195 --> 24:18.632
And you know that, you know, just
'cause you're having sex this one time,

24:23.137 --> 24:25.935
doesn't mean that you
have to all the time.

24:26.274 --> 24:29.037
You know, if it ever starts feeling
like he's taking it for granted

24:29.109 --> 24:33.546
or you're not having...
You're not enjoying it, you can stop any time.

24:33.714 --> 24:36.945
And if you ever break up
with Matt, it's not like,

24:37.017 --> 24:41.283
you know, you have to have sex
with the next boy, necessarily.

24:43.658 --> 24:45.387
Why are you crying?

24:46.361 --> 24:48.488
'Cause I wanted you to wait.

24:51.498 --> 24:54.490
And that's just 'cause I want to
protect you, 'cause I love you,

24:54.568 --> 24:58.800
and I want to make sure that
nothing bad ever happens to you.

25:01.575 --> 25:05.534
And I want you to always be able to
talk to me, even if it's something

25:05.612 --> 25:07.273
so hard like this.

25:13.119 --> 25:15.417
I didn't want
to disappoint you.

25:15.488 --> 25:16.477
No.

25:32.471 --> 25:34.132
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

25:34.206 --> 25:37.539
So, who's the redhead who came
by the house the other day?

25:37.743 --> 25:38.835
Uh, Madison?

25:38.911 --> 25:40.469
Madison. Yeah, Madison,
who's that?

25:40.546 --> 25:42.343
Oh, just a cute girl I met at school.
Uh-huh.

25:42.415 --> 25:44.474
She's a good girl.
I like her. Oh, yeah?

25:44.583 --> 25:46.107
Nope.

25:47.420 --> 25:49.911
All right, ready? Just remember you
are in the middle of the playoffs,

25:49.989 --> 25:52.355
my friend.
That's a good shot.

25:53.525 --> 25:54.890
Listen to me, okay?

25:54.959 --> 25:57.052
Now is not the time
to be chasing skirts, okay?

25:57.128 --> 25:59.289
Why? We are talking
about the Texas State

25:59.364 --> 26:01.423
High School Championship.
Uh-uh! Look at me.

26:01.499 --> 26:03.797
Madison and a bunch
of girls like her

26:03.868 --> 26:06.098
will be waiting in the wings
when the season is over.

26:06.171 --> 26:07.604
She is not going to sit
and wait around for me.

26:07.672 --> 26:08.696
She's going to
find someone else.

26:08.773 --> 26:10.502
She's going to sit and wait
around for 50 years,

26:10.575 --> 26:11.701
you win the State Championship.

26:11.776 --> 26:13.141
She'll be sitting right
over there with bells on.

26:13.211 --> 26:15.235
Believe me. Do me a favor.

26:15.913 --> 26:17.074
Time out, time out.

26:17.916 --> 26:19.144
Look at me.

26:19.217 --> 26:20.582
Look at me.

26:21.052 --> 26:22.451
You're on break with her.

26:22.520 --> 26:25.546
She's on the back burner.
Yes? I'm asking you.

26:27.025 --> 26:28.219
Okay?

26:29.227 --> 26:30.717
Okay.
Good.

26:31.896 --> 26:33.227
To win the game.
To win the game.

26:33.298 --> 26:34.663
No!

26:34.732 --> 26:36.494
Oh! Get out of here!

26:37.634 --> 26:39.625
You ever heard
of The Giving Tree?

26:39.703 --> 26:42.263
You mean the little kids' book
with the little boy and the tree?

26:42.339 --> 26:43.328
Yeah, that one.

26:43.707 --> 26:45.868
So Landry says that
I am the selfish little kid

26:45.943 --> 26:48.639
and he's the tree.
Can you believe that?

26:52.149 --> 26:54.117
Okay, that's an awful
long pause, Julie.

26:54.184 --> 26:57.016
Okay, look,
promise not to be mad at me?

26:57.086 --> 26:58.451
That's just kind of
your relationship.

26:58.521 --> 27:01.251
Like, he worships
the ground you walk on.

27:01.657 --> 27:05.185
He does everything you say and you
allow him to be seen with you.

27:06.997 --> 27:08.760
Yeah, see,
that doesn't help me.

27:08.832 --> 27:11.300
So if you don't think he has
a point, why are we here?

27:11.368 --> 27:12.630
Proving him wrong.

27:13.704 --> 27:14.693
Come on.

27:17.673 --> 27:19.937
They are so good.

27:20.510 --> 27:22.944
Look, I've told you,
you don't have a demo CD.

27:23.012 --> 27:24.980
You don't have
any press to show me.

27:25.047 --> 27:27.982
What are
these guys called again?

27:28.050 --> 27:29.176
Crucifictorious.

27:29.252 --> 27:31.812
Right. Crucifictorious.
Awesome.

27:32.455 --> 27:34.787
They are awesome, and
they have tons of fans.

27:34.857 --> 27:37.348
I mean, this place will
be completely packed.

27:37.527 --> 27:38.550
I...

27:38.627 --> 27:41.221
Not to mention that I am going
to bring all my girlfriends

27:41.329 --> 27:44.059
who happen to
all look like her.

27:57.813 --> 27:58.871
Hey.

28:05.053 --> 28:06.179
Take it.

28:06.955 --> 28:09.480
You and your stupid band are playing at T.
C.' s on Saturday,

28:09.558 --> 28:12.026
so don't say I never did
anything for you, all right?

28:14.930 --> 28:17.660
And you know what?
Don't call me selfish.

28:17.766 --> 28:19.097
Hurts my feelings.

28:34.615 --> 28:36.640
Oh, hi, Matt.

28:36.717 --> 28:40.279
I'm just here to pick up Julie.
To go to the movies.

28:40.989 --> 28:43.923
And then I'm gonna
bring her right back home.

28:44.525 --> 28:45.890
Come on in.

28:46.060 --> 28:47.322
Thanks.

28:48.362 --> 28:50.990
Uh, in fact, you know,
Coach is out in the backyard.

28:51.065 --> 28:52.965
You want to go out,
wait out there?

28:53.033 --> 28:54.227
Go on back.

29:07.046 --> 29:08.206
Coach?

29:10.717 --> 29:12.241
How's it going?

29:15.989 --> 29:17.320
Come here.

29:40.680 --> 29:41.874
I know your father's in Iraq,

29:41.948 --> 29:45.007
but if he was here, I think we'd
agree on one thing, he and I.

29:45.083 --> 29:46.607
The both of us.

29:48.387 --> 29:49.877
And that is,

29:52.057 --> 29:54.082
women are to be respected.

29:55.594 --> 29:56.856
Yes, sir.

30:04.970 --> 30:06.732
That is my daughter.

30:10.941 --> 30:12.204
Yes, sir.

30:30.795 --> 30:31.784
Lyla!

30:34.165 --> 30:37.328
Lyla, I know you're in there.
I see your car out here.

30:37.401 --> 30:38.868
I'm still your daddy.

30:38.936 --> 30:40.528
What do you wanna do?

30:40.604 --> 30:42.094
I have nothing to say to him.

30:42.173 --> 30:43.765
Riggins, let her out of there.

30:44.575 --> 30:47.373
I don't care if I wake up all the neighbors.
Get on out here.

30:49.212 --> 30:50.679
Lyla!

30:52.248 --> 30:54.614
I'm not leaving
till you come out here, Lyla.

30:55.685 --> 30:57.277
Okay! Okay.

31:04.095 --> 31:05.119
What do you want?

31:05.196 --> 31:07.756
What I want, is for you to come home.

31:07.832 --> 31:10.561
This is no excuse for you to
play house with your boyfriend.

31:10.633 --> 31:12.760
You're gonna
lecture me on morals?

31:12.836 --> 31:15.100
Honey, we can work this out.
How are we gonna work it out, Dad?

31:15.171 --> 31:17.969
You're $20,000 in the hole
for tearing up a strip club.

31:18.041 --> 31:20.407
What are you gonna do?
Rob a bank?

31:20.477 --> 31:22.570
You know, you're acting
like a spoiled little brat.

31:22.645 --> 31:25.614
That's what you're doing.
A spoiled little brat! Excuse me?

31:25.682 --> 31:27.809
Now, you are old enough to
know better than this, Lyla.

31:27.884 --> 31:30.045
Life is complicated.
It's not a bowl of cherries.

31:30.120 --> 31:32.917
And right now, your mother is out there
in California, bleeding me dry...

31:32.988 --> 31:34.455
No! You don't
blame this on Mom.

31:34.523 --> 31:37.981
You were the one who cheated, and you
are the one who threw your family away.

31:38.060 --> 31:42.156
And I was the idiot who stuck with you.
And you don't dare call me spoiled.

31:42.231 --> 31:44.665
We've been putting that money
away since I was a baby.

31:44.733 --> 31:46.929
You said if I made those
grades, that it was mine.

31:47.003 --> 31:48.994
And you didn't even ask.

31:49.239 --> 31:53.197
You just do whatever you want, and
wonder why everybody hates you.

31:53.275 --> 31:57.177
Lyla, I'm not through.
Do not walk in there. Get back out here!

31:57.646 --> 31:58.738
Lyla?

32:00.048 --> 32:01.106
Hey.

32:04.353 --> 32:07.811
Tim Riggins, I am gonna talk
to my daughter, young man.

32:09.158 --> 32:10.648
Not right now.

32:10.726 --> 32:13.558
Tim, who the hell
do you think you are, son?

32:13.628 --> 32:14.856
That's my daughter over there!

32:14.929 --> 32:16.487
You need to go.

32:19.500 --> 32:20.660
Please?

32:44.458 --> 32:45.982
See you after the game, okay?

32:46.060 --> 32:47.618
Um, yeah.

32:49.263 --> 32:54.530
Um, you know, maybe we should
just lay off for a while.

32:56.536 --> 32:58.436
Hey, yo, man, what the hell
is that kid doing?

32:58.505 --> 33:01.235
Oh, man, he's throwing away a nice
piece of tail, is what he's doing.

33:01.308 --> 33:03.902
I bet you his daddy told him to do it, man.
He's a punk, dude.

33:03.977 --> 33:05.342
I said I love redheads.

33:12.986 --> 33:14.214
McCoy!

33:15.222 --> 33:17.348
Hey, way to go, Romeo.
What?

33:17.656 --> 33:20.558
You drop that gal?

33:22.095 --> 33:23.392
I don't know. Kind of.

33:23.463 --> 33:26.125
'Cause I'll tell you what.
You know what's good before a game?

33:26.199 --> 33:29.168
Getting laid. A lot.
You know what I mean?

33:29.236 --> 33:30.863
No, that's not happening.

33:30.937 --> 33:32.029
Why?

33:32.439 --> 33:33.701
My dad.

33:34.274 --> 33:35.434
Let me get this straight.

33:35.508 --> 33:39.500
You just ended that whole thing
with her because of your old man?

33:40.412 --> 33:42.209
Well... Sort of.

33:42.281 --> 33:45.842
How do you expect any one of these
guys to battle for you every night,

33:45.918 --> 33:48.409
if you can't make a decision
like that on your own?

33:48.487 --> 33:50.114
'Cause you know
you're a leader, right?

33:50.189 --> 33:51.713
Yeah, yeah.

33:52.625 --> 33:54.490
Start acting like one.

34:20.818 --> 34:21.806
Break!

34:30.762 --> 34:31.751
Hey!

34:32.563 --> 34:34.360
Hey! Hey,
there he goes again!

34:34.431 --> 34:37.094
Where's the flag?
Come on, Billy!

34:37.402 --> 34:39.233
Come on, open your eyes!

34:39.304 --> 34:43.262
Tim Riggins gains a solid
5 before getting leveled by Alsop.

34:43.340 --> 34:45.808
Sure looked like another
late hit by the Bisons.

34:45.876 --> 34:48.844
The Panthers have yet
to get a call tonight.

34:50.580 --> 34:51.774
You good?

34:51.848 --> 34:53.007
All right, let's go!

34:53.083 --> 34:55.643
Hey, man, these fools are playing dirty all night.
What are we gonna do, man?

34:55.719 --> 34:57.711
Suck it up! Let's go.
Call us out, 1, 2.

34:57.789 --> 35:00.053
Eight, 27, tiger, on 1.
Ready?

35:00.124 --> 35:01.523
Break!

35:04.227 --> 35:05.888
Just under two
minutes to go in the half.

35:05.963 --> 35:07.897
And things are getting
pretty ugly out there, folks.

35:12.069 --> 35:14.731
Buckley is using
every dirty trick in the book,

35:14.805 --> 35:18.969
and there has been a noticeable absence
of yellow laundry on that field tonight.

35:19.042 --> 35:21.704
McCoy fires across the middle.
He's got Saracen.

35:22.845 --> 35:25.245
Oh, and that has got to
be pass interference.

35:25.314 --> 35:26.303
What is that?

35:26.716 --> 35:28.479
How can you not see that?

35:28.551 --> 35:31.247
You gotta be kidding me!
You gotta be kidding...

35:31.320 --> 35:32.912
How can you not see that?

35:32.989 --> 35:35.514
What have I got to do to get
you to throw a flag tonight?

35:35.591 --> 35:38.219
Taylor is absolutely
livid on the sidelines.

35:38.294 --> 35:41.856
I mean, he is inconsolable,
and I can't blame him, folks.

35:41.932 --> 35:43.365
A stupid idiot.

35:44.200 --> 35:46.828
J.D.
McCoy back to pass. He fires.

35:47.970 --> 35:49.699
Oh! They hit him
back from the pass!

35:49.772 --> 35:51.069
Oh, my!

35:51.140 --> 35:53.233
Hey! How can you
not see that?

35:53.309 --> 35:54.537
What is that, ref?

35:54.610 --> 35:55.838
Come on!

35:56.312 --> 35:57.779
What? Come on!

35:58.180 --> 36:01.616
You know what you are? You're a no-calling
son of a bitch! That's what you are!

36:01.684 --> 36:02.844
Bill, you're a no-calling
son of a bitch.

36:02.918 --> 36:04.010
You want a flag?

36:04.086 --> 36:05.109
Give me a flag!
You want a flag?

36:05.186 --> 36:07.177
Give me a damn flag!
Let me see it! I wanna see it!

36:07.255 --> 36:08.313
I'll do anything to see...

36:10.692 --> 36:12.250
Oh, good, that's great!

36:15.597 --> 36:17.155
Here, you take your flag.

36:18.400 --> 36:20.231
You go! You are gone!

36:20.301 --> 36:22.030
And Coach
Taylor is gone, folks.

36:22.103 --> 36:24.469
He has been
ejected from this contest.

36:24.539 --> 36:26.768
He is handing the reins
over to Wade Aikmen,

36:26.840 --> 36:30.800
and he will have to sit the rest
of this game in the locker room.

36:39.687 --> 36:43.680
Wade Aikmen has taken over the offense.
Now, he's been a quarterback...

36:43.758 --> 36:44.986
How you doing?

36:48.062 --> 36:49.859
The ball has
definitely landed in his court,

36:49.930 --> 36:51.090
it's a hot one.

36:51.165 --> 36:52.359
He's bringing the Panthers out.

36:52.433 --> 36:53.627
Let's see what he's got, folks.

36:56.737 --> 36:58.227
Hello! Hello!

36:58.305 --> 36:59.567
Listen, they're stacking
the linebackers.

36:59.640 --> 37:01.232
Have Riggins on the sweep.
You understand?

37:01.308 --> 37:03.208
Get on the line!
Coach?

37:03.277 --> 37:05.768
You hear me now?
Can you hear me?

37:05.846 --> 37:07.814
I said they're stacking
the linebackers.

37:07.881 --> 37:09.404
I can't hear you, Coach!

37:10.683 --> 37:11.707
Go! Go!

37:11.784 --> 37:13.149
Right here!

37:20.394 --> 37:22.919
7-27, come on, go!
Go, get out there! Hello?

37:22.996 --> 37:24.759
Get in there! Get in!

37:25.399 --> 37:28.391
Coach! I'll call you back.
I can't hear you!

37:30.336 --> 37:33.772
Wade Aikmen's inspired
play-calling has put the Panthers

37:33.840 --> 37:37.799
deep in Bison territory.
Boy, look at the pass. Oh!

37:37.877 --> 37:42.712
Oh, no, and he is sacked.
And that is going to be a 7-yard loss on the play.

37:43.182 --> 37:45.844
The clock is rolling, folks.
The Panthers down by 3.

37:45.918 --> 37:48.887
They cannot afford to make
any mistakes at this point.

37:48.955 --> 37:52.890
Here we go. J.D. McCoy is rolling left.
He fires back.

37:52.958 --> 37:55.688
It's a screen play to Riggins.
He's got room!

37:55.760 --> 38:00.663
He's to the 20! To the 15!
To the 10, to the 5!

38:00.732 --> 38:05.670
Boom! Big Tim Riggins powers in.
Touchdown, Panthers!

38:05.738 --> 38:08.172
Oh, mercy!

38:08.241 --> 38:13.234
This one is over, folks.
Panthers win, Panthers win!

38:15.046 --> 38:16.570
You got Scotch in here?

38:31.930 --> 38:34.557
You really gotta hand it
to Coach Wade Aikmen, folks.

38:34.632 --> 38:38.830
He did a fantastic job under
some terrible circumstances.

38:38.903 --> 38:42.634
A bright shining star on
the Dillon football horizon.

38:43.274 --> 38:45.367
Well, he's in bed,
sound asleep.

38:45.943 --> 38:46.932
Thank you.

38:47.411 --> 38:48.935
Well, you sound a little
disappointed in that.

38:49.013 --> 38:51.175
Yeah, yeah, I was kind of hoping
he might be out on a date.

38:51.249 --> 38:53.774
That's not
going to happen.

38:53.851 --> 38:55.580
We had a...
We had a little chat.

38:58.289 --> 38:59.278
You did?

38:59.823 --> 39:01.290
Yeah.
When?

39:02.359 --> 39:04.088
Just the other day.

39:04.161 --> 39:06.629
Well, you know, he saw the wisdom in
waiting until we won the State...

39:06.697 --> 39:09.461
Joe, you gotta quit making all these
unilateral decisions without including me.

39:09.533 --> 39:11.000
Sweetie...
No, I am his mother.

39:11.068 --> 39:12.899
It's not that big of a deal...
It is a big deal.

39:12.970 --> 39:15.836
Taking a break, and then Mercedes or
Madison or whatever the heck her name is,

39:15.905 --> 39:17.770
she will be there
when the season is over.

39:17.840 --> 39:20.365
You know what? You're really starting
to freak me out. And I don't like it.

39:20.443 --> 39:22.911
Honey, what's the big deal?
This whole football thing is freaking me out.

39:22.979 --> 39:25.038
He's taking a break from a girl
who's distracting him... Whatever!

39:25.114 --> 39:27.048
From the most important
football games of his life.

39:27.116 --> 39:30.279
Yeah, it's all football, football,
football, football, isn't it?

39:37.360 --> 39:38.486
What?
Nothing.

39:38.561 --> 39:41.086
Oh, man, what did
you see out there?

39:41.164 --> 39:43.132
Nothing.
I didn't see anything.

39:43.199 --> 39:44.826
Excuse me.
Just...

39:47.503 --> 39:48.697
Is that...

39:51.374 --> 39:53.137
That little bastard.

40:00.782 --> 40:04.047
Hey, y'all. Is this gonna be
really bad, 'cause I'm...

40:04.119 --> 40:05.347
I'm a little nervous.

40:05.420 --> 40:07.718
There's a strong,
strong possibility.

40:08.890 --> 40:10.755
Everybody,
we're Crucifictorious.

40:10.826 --> 40:12.521
Thank you for coming out.

40:14.396 --> 40:18.957
I can't shake
the conversation

40:19.567 --> 40:20.932
Did I jump?

40:22.737 --> 40:24.501
Did I run free?

40:24.573 --> 40:28.475
Final statement
I thought I made

40:28.543 --> 40:33.480
But, no, I'm talking to my feet

40:44.692 --> 40:46.523
They're not that bad.

40:47.228 --> 40:49.355
Landry's kind of cute up there.

40:49.930 --> 40:50.954
Yeah, I know.

40:51.032 --> 40:52.693
It's love or time

40:55.169 --> 40:57.194
She can't break...

41:29.235 --> 41:31.965
Lyla, it's me.

41:33.673 --> 41:34.935
Your dad.

41:35.742 --> 41:38.267
Please call me back.
I'm sorry.

41:40.180 --> 41:41.169
I...

41:42.148 --> 41:43.842
You were right, Lyla.

41:46.585 --> 41:48.610
I'm very, very sorry.

41:49.421 --> 41:51.946
Please call me back. Please.

41:53.392 --> 41:55.485
I love you very, very much.

41:57.629 --> 41:59.325
I love you, honey.

42:01.267 --> 42:02.325
Bye.
