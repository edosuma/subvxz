WEBVTT

00:04.991 --> 00:06.029
Previously in E. R.

00:06.030 --> 00:08.834
I don't want to be hooked up to
a bunch of tubes puking my guts out.

00:08.835 --> 00:10.541
Mark, I have to respect his wishes.

00:10.542 --> 00:12.693
He's my father, ok? I want to help him.

00:12.693 --> 00:13.647
Just be there for him.

00:13.648 --> 00:16.956
I don't think is too serious, Mr Bernero.
Maybe a little touch of stomach flu.

00:16.991 --> 00:19.595
I want you to pee in the cup. Give it to Malik.
It's what he lives for.

00:19.596 --> 00:21.458
We need to get your son into a diabetes clinic.

00:21.459 --> 00:25.218
There's a new drug, glucofile,
that works well for kids but it is expensive.

00:25.219 --> 00:27.781
I'll have my new insurance in three months.

00:27.782 --> 00:29.638
I'll get him to diet and exercising.

00:29.673 --> 00:32.872
You let that kid walk out of here
to accomodate his father financial problems,

00:33.049 --> 00:34.251
you're endangering that boy's life.

00:34.252 --> 00:36.052
Bernero kid in Three can go home.

00:36.183 --> 00:39.413
Just a little case of the stomach flu.
Kick him out of there. We need the bed.

00:41.339 --> 00:44.256
E. R. 6x17 "VIABLE OPTIONS"

00:45.843 --> 00:49.258
Discharged the rule-out MI.
Last enzymes normal.

00:49.429 --> 00:51.884
- The pneumonia's in Medicine.
- Good.

00:52.056 --> 00:55.472
Morning. I hear a double trauma's
coming in. Need help?

00:55.684 --> 00:57.427
Just two. We can handle it.

00:57.602 --> 00:59.760
I'm flipping burgers.
Might as well flip them.

00:59.979 --> 01:02.137
- Excuse me?
- Ray Kroc. Started McDonald's.

01:02.315 --> 01:06.810
Once a year he'd make shakes,
fry fries with the little people.

01:07.027 --> 01:10.110
- You're in the trenches.
- With us little people.

01:10.279 --> 01:12.070
So the ship's shipshape.

01:12.239 --> 01:15.821
- Son of a bitch! You started it!
- The hell I did!

01:16.034 --> 01:18.869
- Cut it out!
- Let's break this up!

01:19.036 --> 01:20.578
- That's enough
- Hey, hey.

01:20.746 --> 01:22.655
- Get away from him. That's enough.
- Hey!

01:22.831 --> 01:25.286
Get your hands off me,
dumb-ass punk!

01:25.458 --> 01:27.450
- Dumb-ass punk.
- Get out here.

01:27.668 --> 01:29.043
- What's open?
- Curtain 2!

01:29.253 --> 01:30.795
- I'll sue your ass!
- Kiss my ass!

01:30.963 --> 01:32.540
- You ran into me!
- You cut me off!

01:32.756 --> 01:34.415
- You're crazy!
- Enough!

01:34.632 --> 01:36.423
- Settle down, bud.
- Who you calling "bud"?

01:37.968 --> 01:40.541
- Hey, that's enough!
- Get off me, man.

01:41.596 --> 01:43.754
- You, bud.
- What happened here?

01:43.973 --> 01:47.424
- Road rage led to an MVA.
- Which led to a fistfight.

01:47.601 --> 01:51.265
Multiple abrasions,
bad lac to left arm. BP, 120/80.

01:51.437 --> 01:55.481
Janes, 25. Multiple abrasions,
head lac. BP, 110/70.

01:55.649 --> 01:58.140
- Get soft restraints.
- I didn't start it.

01:58.318 --> 02:00.144
- Tried to sideswipe me.
- Settle down!

02:00.320 --> 02:03.154
- We need to treat you.
- You rear-ended me, moron.

02:03.322 --> 02:05.444
- That's it!
- Hey!

02:06.533 --> 02:08.359
- Call Security!
- Hold it!

02:08.533 --> 02:11.203
- You're the moron!
- You son of a bitch!

02:14.164 --> 02:15.955
Oh, my God!

02:18.751 --> 02:21.704
- Down on the bed!
- Man! This is nasty!

02:21.920 --> 02:24.671
- Do something!
- Just settle down.

02:24.839 --> 02:28.208
- You call this flipping burgers?
- Very funny.

02:29.134 --> 02:34.091
Seems to be under control.
If you don't need any little people...

02:34.263 --> 02:36.754
Thank you, Kerry.
I'm sure I can handle it from here.

02:36.974 --> 02:38.349
Shall I yank it out?

02:38.559 --> 02:43.303
We gotta check for facial nerve damage,
and damage to my pen.

02:43.479 --> 02:47.523
- You're worrying about your pen?
- Oh, shut up.

02:49.000 --> 02:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:43.402 --> 03:46.438
- Put it back on, Dad.
- I don't need it.

03:48.323 --> 03:50.611
It makes me want to sneeze.

03:52.952 --> 03:57.328
- I don't need you waiting around.
- I'm afraid you'll take it off.

03:57.539 --> 03:59.946
Get used to it. I made up my mind.

04:00.124 --> 04:05.628
I won't do my dying in your cramped,
thin-walled walkup.

04:05.795 --> 04:10.373
- Maybe we ought to move.
- Stop. You know what I mean.

04:11.884 --> 04:14.837
Even if I stay in Chicago,
I want my own place.

04:16.095 --> 04:18.846
- How's that gonna work?
- Well, I'll...

04:19.180 --> 04:20.889
...get somebody to help.

04:21.058 --> 04:24.508
No. You'll ignore it,
like you have the last year. I know you.

04:24.686 --> 04:29.181
No, you don't! You know this disease,
but not what I want.

04:29.398 --> 04:32.433
- I don't wanna talk about this.
- Then don't.

04:39.406 --> 04:44.280
Chest x-ray's clear. Labs are normal.
Hematocrit of 32.

04:44.493 --> 04:48.075
- What's my potassium?
-4.2. It's fine.

04:48.288 --> 04:52.415
I figured it would be.
I had dialysis yesterday.

04:52.583 --> 04:56.034
- Is it a man or a woman?
- It's a man.

04:56.211 --> 04:59.081
- What happened to him?
- I don't know.

04:59.297 --> 05:02.131
An accident? That's usually it.

05:02.341 --> 05:04.914
Yup. I think it was. In Minneapolis.

05:05.135 --> 05:07.921
- They'll fly the kidney in from there?
- Yeah.

05:08.095 --> 05:12.840
- Dr. Corday's procuring the organ.
- They put it in a cooler.

05:13.058 --> 05:16.343
Man, I thought I'd never
make it to the top of the list.

05:16.461 --> 05:17.475
You're lucky.

05:17.570 --> 05:19.727
If I were lucky, I wouldn't need
the kidney to begin with.

05:19.897 --> 05:22.850
- As you do-
- Yeah, yeah. I'm hungry.

05:23.441 --> 05:27.485
You can't eat or drink anything.
I've cleared you for the surgery.

05:27.653 --> 05:31.235
- We're waiting for the kidney.
- I'm not going anywhere.

05:32.949 --> 05:34.359
The kid started it.

05:34.533 --> 05:38.826
- Then he rammed into my damn car!
- Dad, you said that already.

05:41.706 --> 05:43.912
- Damn it!
- It's all right.

05:44.124 --> 05:48.335
- It's not. I hate being clumsy.
- It's no big deal.

05:48.545 --> 05:53.502
Let's finish your sutures.
You need to hold still.

05:53.674 --> 05:56.295
- I think I know that. Okay?
- Dad?

05:59.220 --> 06:03.087
I'm sorry.
It's just been a crappy day.

06:03.765 --> 06:08.011
- Can I get some more water?
- Yeah, sure. I'll go.

06:09.645 --> 06:13.060
I'm gonna hit the ladies' room.
I'll be right back, okay?

06:15.817 --> 06:17.394
What's going on? Is he all right?

06:17.610 --> 06:21.393
- Well, I think he's a little upset.
- I've never seen him like this.

06:21.613 --> 06:23.771
Running into a car.
Stabbed a man with a pen?

06:23.948 --> 06:26.106
- Has he always had a temper?
- No. Never.

06:26.283 --> 06:29.118
But this week, since I've been visiting,
he just seems off.

06:29.286 --> 06:31.859
He loses his balance sometimes,
lashes out at people.

06:32.080 --> 06:34.914
Does he have seizures
or bad headaches?

06:35.082 --> 06:37.158
Not that I know of.
Is something wrong?

06:37.334 --> 06:41.461
I'll need to run some tests and get
a head CT. Then we'll know more.

06:41.671 --> 06:44.541
- Ladies' room is down there.
- Thanks.

06:44.756 --> 06:46.381
He's taking codeine for his back.

06:46.591 --> 06:50.125
He has abdominal pain.
Positive history for an appy.

06:50.803 --> 06:52.511
Might be a bowel obstruction.

06:52.680 --> 06:56.130
- Is my kidney here?
- I don't know. Sorry.

06:56.349 --> 06:58.887
I'm still hungry. I could've eaten.

06:59.352 --> 07:03.016
- Good bowel sounds. Any fever?
- No.

07:03.188 --> 07:05.346
- Vomiting?
- Nope.

07:05.565 --> 07:07.557
No guarding or rebound.

07:08.192 --> 07:10.979
- Get an abdominal series?
- Just now.

07:11.153 --> 07:13.145
Excuse us a minute, please.

07:21.745 --> 07:24.116
No blockage. Just a lot of stool.

07:24.288 --> 07:26.993
So the codeine constipated him?

07:27.207 --> 07:31.667
I'd have him cut back on his pain meds
and give him a laxative. Also...

07:31.878 --> 07:36.835
...have the pharmacy give him bisacodyl,
10 mg a day.

07:37.007 --> 07:41.383
- Sorry. I thought it was serious.
- To him it is.

07:41.352 --> 07:43.260
She's had trouble breathing.

07:43.370 --> 07:44.301
Any fever?

07:44.396 --> 07:47.527
Yes up to 102. Lots of secretions.

07:47.562 --> 07:51.305
She was diagnosed with
Sanfilippo Syndrome when she was 2.

07:51.518 --> 07:54.851
She has a seizure disorder
and PICC line.

07:55.063 --> 07:57.269
Takes O-2 and BiPAP at home.

07:57.482 --> 08:00.316
- Can Angie talk?
- She's severely retarded.

08:00.526 --> 08:03.360
She lost her hearing.
She can't feed herself.

08:03.570 --> 08:07.863
- Her medications?
- Lasix, albuterol, Robinul, Valium.

08:08.032 --> 08:10.357
Phenobarb, cisapride, Bactrim.

08:10.575 --> 08:13.362
She has rales. Probably pneumonia.

08:13.536 --> 08:16.027
Last month it was pseudomonas.

08:16.205 --> 08:18.778
Temp's 102.
Culture her PICC line?

08:18.999 --> 08:23.292
And portable chest, CBC,
sputum and peripheral cultures.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.787
She gets Ceftaz when
she has pneumonia.

08:26.964 --> 08:28.292
We'll do the same.

08:28.465 --> 08:32.544
I'll go get her dolls.
They help her feel better.

08:32.760 --> 08:35.001
We'll take good care of her.

08:35.220 --> 08:39.466
Could we get a VCR?
She loves to watch the Muppets.

08:39.640 --> 08:43.009
- Sure. We'll bring one in.
- Thank you.

08:44.519 --> 08:49.264
Eddie Bernero, 12. His dad
found him barely responsive.

08:49.482 --> 08:51.308
Dad's coming in his car.

08:51.525 --> 08:53.398
BP 90 palp, pulse 120, resps 28.

08:54.110 --> 08:56.482
May be encephalitis, meningitis.

08:56.696 --> 08:58.569
- He's been in before.
- Pull the chart.

08:58.739 --> 09:01.905
- The nurse signed us out.
- You said I need medicine.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.403
I'll be there.

09:03.576 --> 09:05.569
- Help them transfer him?
- Sure.

09:05.745 --> 09:08.615
- Is the prescription back?
- Yeah.

09:08.831 --> 09:12.413
Once a day
until the constipation resolves.

09:13.626 --> 09:15.203
- All yours.
- Thanks.

09:15.419 --> 09:18.870
- A CBC, lytes and dip a urine.
- Tachy at 150.

09:19.089 --> 09:23.133
- Pressure's down, 70 palp.
- He may go into shock.

09:23.342 --> 09:26.047
Mucous membranes are dry.
Very dehydrated.

09:26.261 --> 09:28.586
Urine's positive for glucose,
no ketones.

09:28.763 --> 09:31.598
Where's the old chart?
Is he diabetic?

09:31.807 --> 09:34.428
He was in five months ago.
Gastroenteritis.

09:34.643 --> 09:36.303
- Blood glucose?
- Almost.

09:36.478 --> 09:39.976
Bolus him with normal saline,
10 cc's per kg.

09:40.147 --> 09:41.689
Blood glucose is over 400.

09:41.857 --> 09:45.272
- What? Are you sure?
- I checked it twice.

09:46.277 --> 09:48.020
It's a hyperosmolar coma.

09:48.237 --> 09:51.819
Start an insulin IV,
. 1 unit per kilo per hour.

09:52.032 --> 09:56.325
Get bicarb and potassium levels.
He's been sick a while.

09:56.494 --> 10:00.538
- His blood glucose last time?
- They didn't do one.

10:00.747 --> 10:03.950
- You're kidding. Did they dip a urine?
- No.

10:04.125 --> 10:06.960
- Who took care of this kid?
- Carter.

10:08.128 --> 10:10.583
Page him. Get him here now.

10:14.217 --> 10:17.466
- Flight took forever.
- We have time.

10:17.636 --> 10:20.340
- Ruled out the first recipient.
- Thought you cleared him.

10:20.513 --> 10:24.557
- He developed unstable angina.
- Did you talk to UNOS?

10:24.767 --> 10:27.720
Another Chicago person's on her way.

10:27.936 --> 10:31.138
I hope the kidney
will still be viable.

10:31.314 --> 10:33.306
- Family?
- Dad's on his way.

10:33.482 --> 10:36.103
Recheck his levels in two hours.

10:36.318 --> 10:37.812
What's up?

10:38.444 --> 10:42.488
Eddie Bernero,
on his way to the PICU.

10:42.656 --> 10:46.190
I'll refresh your memory.
You saw him five months ago.

10:46.784 --> 10:49.357
- I don't recall him.
- Neither did I.

10:49.578 --> 10:52.828
You called me in.
Couch-potato diabetic.

10:53.039 --> 10:57.036
Dad had insurance problems.
You doctored the chart?

10:57.209 --> 10:58.751
What are you saying?

10:58.961 --> 11:03.503
He could've died. I rehydrated him
without knowing he had diabetes.

11:03.715 --> 11:05.173
Show me the chart.

11:05.341 --> 11:07.962
His electrolytes were so off,
he could've died.

11:09.011 --> 11:12.758
- What were you thinking?
- Your patient's having a seizure.

11:12.930 --> 11:16.512
If anybody asks questions,
I won't lie for you.

11:18.977 --> 11:22.179
- Nice hair.
- Can you get Bernero's chart?

11:22.355 --> 11:25.937
- We sent it up to PICU.
- I know. Get it.

11:29.861 --> 11:31.687
Henry is so excited.

11:31.862 --> 11:35.147
It had to be the day he flew
to St. Louis!

11:35.365 --> 11:39.196
- He's coming?
- He could fly under his own power.

11:40.494 --> 11:44.028
I did dialysis four years,
three times a week.

11:44.247 --> 11:46.619
But then I switched to CAPD.

11:46.833 --> 11:50.166
- How often are the infusions?
- Four times a day.

11:50.335 --> 11:53.917
Like getting my oil changed. A lot.

11:54.130 --> 11:56.537
- But it gives you more freedom.
- Oh, yeah.

11:56.716 --> 12:00.499
It's great not going to the hospital
every other day-

12:00.677 --> 12:03.761
- And with the transplant-
- Have you had peritonitis?

12:03.930 --> 12:07.096
Yes, but not for at least six months.

12:08.725 --> 12:11.809
Okay. Everything looks good,
Mrs. Bassett.

12:13.354 --> 12:15.975
We'll wait for your labs
and then get you to the O.R.

12:16.190 --> 12:17.518
Thank you so much.

12:17.691 --> 12:21.937
I didn't have much to do with it,
but you're welcome.

12:24.655 --> 12:28.782
- Mrs. Dwyer.
- I'm back. You'll be okay, sweetie.

12:28.992 --> 12:32.739
- The nurse told you?
- You must start another IV.

12:32.911 --> 12:36.196
We've tried but Angie's a tough stick.

12:36.414 --> 12:38.952
She has a lot of scarring from IVs.

12:39.166 --> 12:43.911
- So a central line's better.
- It's the best way for her.

12:44.087 --> 12:45.415
I understand.

12:45.588 --> 12:49.632
- Could you sign the consent form?
- I can't.

12:49.800 --> 12:54.710
- It's very safe.
- I'm her foster mom, not her real mom.

12:54.887 --> 12:59.762
We care for her. We'd adopt,
but we can't afford the medical.

12:59.933 --> 13:03.348
- And her birth parents?
- They abandoned her.

13:03.561 --> 13:06.680
She has a legal guardian
through DCFS.

13:06.855 --> 13:09.560
Carol, call Adele Neuman.

13:09.774 --> 13:12.099
Can't you do anything else?

13:12.276 --> 13:16.108
We will keep trying for another IV,
all right?

13:16.280 --> 13:17.821
Sweetie, here we go.

13:17.989 --> 13:20.943
- Mr. Bernero?
- Dr. Carter, right?

13:21.158 --> 13:24.443
- How is he?
- Much better. Glucose is 380.

13:24.620 --> 13:26.908
- His lytes?
- Normalizing.

13:27.122 --> 13:31.249
He'll be here a couple days,
but he's out of the woods.

13:31.458 --> 13:34.459
- Do you have a minute?
- Of course.

13:41.300 --> 13:44.004
What happened, Mr. Bernero?

13:44.219 --> 13:46.970
We're working on the diet issues.

13:47.179 --> 13:50.345
- What happened?
- You knew my insurance problem.

13:50.557 --> 13:54.601
You knew his condition's serious.
I cut you some slack.

13:54.810 --> 13:57.930
You agreed to monitor his food
and exercise.

13:58.147 --> 14:01.681
- You know how kids are.
- That's why they have parents.

14:01.858 --> 14:04.431
We have complete insurance now.

14:04.652 --> 14:07.486
At what expense? His life?
He almost died today.

14:08.363 --> 14:12.739
You never said it could get this bad.
He was fine until this morning.

14:13.576 --> 14:15.069
Oh, great.

14:15.869 --> 14:19.700
You're not culpable at all?
Is that right?

14:19.914 --> 14:24.789
You're his doctor.
You said he'd be fine for a few months.

14:25.001 --> 14:28.868
If you didn't know this could happen,
how could I?

14:35.552 --> 14:40.711
It's not an emergency,
but the child needs IV access.

14:40.931 --> 14:45.675
We know she's often hospitalized,
but that has nothing to do with this.

14:45.852 --> 14:47.974
Her veins are sclerosed.
I can't get a thing.

14:48.145 --> 14:50.600
Neither can I. This is ridiculous.

14:50.856 --> 14:52.978
Give me the phone. Come on.

14:53.191 --> 14:57.188
This is Kerry Weaver,
chief of emergency medicine.

14:57.402 --> 15:00.023
Angie's PICC line is infected-

15:00.238 --> 15:03.606
A guardian should know
what a PICC line is.

15:03.824 --> 15:09.162
I know her disease is incurable.
But she is treatable now-

15:10.121 --> 15:13.454
It's not a matter of life or death yet,
but it could be-

15:13.666 --> 15:17.709
Have you ever seen Angie?
I'm looking at her now.

15:17.877 --> 15:21.376
I see an eminently treatable
girl who-

15:22.423 --> 15:25.755
Thank you. Thank you for nothing.

15:27.593 --> 15:32.219
He said no. Give her pain meds
and make her comfortable.

15:34.933 --> 15:36.261
There it is.

15:37.310 --> 15:40.512
A heartbeat.
You're definitely pregnant.

15:41.563 --> 15:44.184
You're about eight weeks along.

15:44.732 --> 15:46.974
I wish Henry would get here.

15:47.192 --> 15:49.398
You been trying to get pregnant?

15:49.611 --> 15:54.402
For almost two years.
With no luck. Until now.

15:55.741 --> 15:58.658
Does it take me out of the running?

15:58.869 --> 16:03.079
After a transplant,
one takes immunosuppressive drugs.

16:03.289 --> 16:04.664
They're powerful.

16:04.832 --> 16:09.825
It's likely they'd cause birth defects
or a miscarriage.

16:11.337 --> 16:16.543
If you won't have the child,
we can go ahead with surgery.

16:19.719 --> 16:24.629
Sorry to pressure you.
We don't have much time for the kidney.

16:24.848 --> 16:26.507
We can't wait for your husband.

16:28.768 --> 16:30.807
How could this happen?

16:32.270 --> 16:34.595
I've waited so long...

16:34.814 --> 16:36.937
...for both.

16:38.234 --> 16:39.562
Mrs. Bassett.

16:44.447 --> 16:45.941
I want to keep the baby.

16:49.367 --> 16:50.826
Okay.

16:53.204 --> 16:56.323
- Did you have an appointment?
- Same old, same old.

16:56.540 --> 16:59.908
Where's the snack bar?
I'd like a bite.

17:00.126 --> 17:03.909
- Do you mind some company?
- No. Let's go.

17:05.130 --> 17:07.372
His daughter says
his behavior's been unusual?

17:07.589 --> 17:11.125
Erratic and volatile.
Used to be easygoing.

17:11.301 --> 17:14.884
- Maybe a mass or lesion?
- No signs of that.

17:15.096 --> 17:19.010
- Any new stress at home or at work?
- He claims no.

17:19.183 --> 17:24.259
We have uncontrolled movements,
loss of balance, personality change.

17:24.479 --> 17:26.804
- Family history?
- His mom's living.

17:26.981 --> 17:30.231
He doesn't know much about his dad,
he died when Waters was 14.

17:30.442 --> 17:32.565
- Makes him early- mid-40s?
- Probably.

17:32.777 --> 17:35.612
- What did he die of?
- Suicide.

17:35.863 --> 17:37.855
We need to talk to him.

17:39.324 --> 17:42.657
I wish you'd talk some sense
into Mark.

17:42.827 --> 17:45.993
- He's worried about you.
- I know he is.

17:46.205 --> 17:49.454
He also thinks that he can control
what's happening to me.

17:49.624 --> 17:54.997
Hell! I wish he could,
but we all know he can't.

17:56.838 --> 18:00.123
It's a cliché to say you don't wanna be
a burden to your children...

18:00.299 --> 18:03.253
...but at my age, I'll be a cliché.

18:03.427 --> 18:07.175
He shouldn't have to deal
with everything.

18:07.347 --> 18:09.802
He will, one way or another.

18:10.683 --> 18:13.469
Would your mother let you
take care of her?

18:14.478 --> 18:17.312
She'd sooner go to sea in a canoe.

18:17.480 --> 18:20.397
I don't need to go to that extreme.

18:20.566 --> 18:23.139
I want to check out-
What do you call it?

18:23.318 --> 18:26.105
Not quite a nursing home.

18:26.320 --> 18:29.736
- A hospice?
- That's it. A hospice.

18:30.741 --> 18:35.366
If I stay in Chicago,
at least that'll make Mark happy.

18:37.871 --> 18:41.703
Nothing about this
will make Mark happy.

18:47.087 --> 18:50.337
- Huntington's Disease?
- We think so.

18:50.548 --> 18:55.256
- I never heard of it.
- A progressive neurological disorder.

18:55.469 --> 18:59.466
It causes loss of balance, mood changes
and jerking movements of the body.

18:59.639 --> 19:02.046
And progressive dementia.

19:03.725 --> 19:07.390
- Like Alzheimer's?
- There are similarities.

19:08.312 --> 19:10.104
Okay.

19:11.774 --> 19:14.560
We know what it is. What do I do?

19:14.734 --> 19:17.307
I'm afraid there's no cure.

19:18.195 --> 19:22.062
- How bad will it get?
- A geneticist will tell you.

19:22.240 --> 19:27.032
You're telling me I'll lose control
of everything physically and mentally...

19:27.203 --> 19:28.910
...and I can't do anything about it?

19:29.079 --> 19:34.369
They're developing new treatments.
But at the moment, no.

19:42.632 --> 19:44.505
I'm 46 years old.

19:47.219 --> 19:52.259
- How could I get such a thing?
- It's genetic. You inherited it.

19:53.057 --> 19:56.472
It generally manifests
in your early 40s.

19:56.935 --> 20:00.268
It may be why your dad
committed suicide.

20:09.111 --> 20:14.152
- I could've passed this on to Jo?
- There is a 50-50 chance.

20:19.953 --> 20:24.661
Hyperosmolar coma, no evidence
of DKA. Type Two diabetes.

20:24.832 --> 20:29.410
- I'd say. His blood glucose was 980.
- How far did you get?

20:29.628 --> 20:34.455
Two liters saline, two units IV insulin.
He's still in the PICU.

20:34.632 --> 20:38.676
- He was seen here five months ago?
- Apparently.

20:39.886 --> 20:44.298
- If it's 980, it was high five months ago.
- You'd think so.

20:44.473 --> 20:48.138
- Why wasn't it picked up?
- I couldn't say. Excuse me.

20:48.310 --> 20:52.389
- Could you look at this elbow film?
- What's the problem?

20:52.605 --> 20:56.020
Big anterior fat pad but no fracture.

20:56.233 --> 21:00.312
You the Attending?
I'm admitting Eddie Bernero.

21:00.528 --> 21:01.856
The diabetic coma?

21:02.029 --> 21:05.860
Yeah. He was here in November.
No one picked up on his diabetes.

21:06.032 --> 21:08.605
- Do you have the old chart?
- Here's a copy.

21:08.784 --> 21:12.200
- Cleo, what was the glucose?
-980.

21:12.996 --> 21:16.827
- Not today. In November.
- Should be in the chart.

21:18.167 --> 21:21.535
- No urine dip?
- Not that I saw.

21:21.711 --> 21:26.538
- I'll look into this. I'll call you.
- Thanks. Dr. Finch.

21:28.509 --> 21:32.755
- An anterior fat pad can be normal.
- Thanks.

21:32.929 --> 21:35.336
Something you didn't wanna say
in front of him?

21:35.556 --> 21:38.342
- About what?
- The diabetic kid.

21:38.517 --> 21:42.015
- He was Carter's.
- You're not in surgery?

21:42.228 --> 21:46.307
We still have the kidney.
We go through recipients like-

21:46.481 --> 21:49.186
- Crap through a goose?
- Yeah. That works.

21:49.359 --> 21:51.849
The Morgan Center will call you.

21:52.027 --> 21:54.103
- Hospice? Rehab?
- Hospice.

21:54.279 --> 21:57.030
- What patient?
- Your father asked me about it.

21:57.240 --> 22:00.359
- He may choose palliative care.
- You called?

22:00.534 --> 22:03.819
- He asked me to.
- What are you doing?

22:04.037 --> 22:07.571
- He asked. What would you have me do?
- Have him talk to me.

22:07.790 --> 22:10.281
- He's a grown man.
- A stubborn one.

22:10.876 --> 22:13.876
- The other option is your apartment-
- I know my options.

22:14.087 --> 22:17.704
- You'll look after him?
- With a daytime nurse. I'll do the rest.

22:17.882 --> 22:21.831
- You talked to him?
- I'm handling it, okay? Or I was.

22:23.303 --> 22:26.007
- I didn't mean to interfere.
- Then don't.

22:29.474 --> 22:34.301
- Is this what's best for him, or you?
- Stay out of it, please.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.051
Fine.

22:42.151 --> 22:44.274
I can send her up now.

22:44.445 --> 22:46.069
Good. Thanks.

22:47.197 --> 22:50.945
- They can squeeze you in.
- I can't see my own ob-gyn?

22:51.117 --> 22:55.742
No. Too many potential complications
with your renal failure.

22:55.912 --> 22:57.406
- Dr. Kovac?
- Yeah?

22:57.622 --> 22:59.744
This is Steve Maldonado.

22:59.957 --> 23:01.830
- The transplant candidate.
- Right.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.119
- You the surgeon?
- No, but we'll get you started here.

23:06.087 --> 23:08.660
I went out and left my pager at home.

23:08.756 --> 23:11.211
I went home to get it and it went off.

23:11.383 --> 23:13.340
I had it on for 30 seconds.

23:13.510 --> 23:16.510
Yeah. The nurses need
to draw your labs.

23:16.679 --> 23:17.710
- This way.
- Okay.

23:17.888 --> 23:20.592
- Good luck.
- Yeah, thanks.

23:22.934 --> 23:23.965
You all right?

23:25.227 --> 23:27.266
If I could have both, I would be.

23:29.522 --> 23:31.266
But I do want the baby.

23:32.942 --> 23:37.105
Ask for Christine Collins.
Suite 4020.

23:37.279 --> 23:39.947
Okay. Bye.

23:40.114 --> 23:41.525
Bye.

23:43.450 --> 23:46.866
Okay, Mr. Waters.
The geneticist is Dr. Kevin Casey.

23:47.078 --> 23:51.490
I made an appointment for you on Friday
at 11 to go over the results.

23:51.707 --> 23:55.075
I've been ordered to appear
in court Friday afternoon.

23:55.293 --> 23:58.293
The incident.
I can make a day out of it.

23:58.462 --> 24:01.131
Uncontrolled temper is a symptom
of Huntington's.

24:01.340 --> 24:04.922
- They may not hold you responsible.
- That's a lousy excuse.

24:06.761 --> 24:10.923
- How is Jo doing?
- She's meeting Glen in the lobby now.

24:11.098 --> 24:15.842
- That's her fiancé.
- Does she want to have the test?

24:18.478 --> 24:23.056
- I didn't tell her.
- Mr. Waters, you have to.

24:23.232 --> 24:27.016
If she has the gene,
she will get the disease.

24:27.236 --> 24:30.402
My father didn't tell me
and I'm glad he didn't.

24:30.613 --> 24:32.191
She has a right to know.

24:32.365 --> 24:35.531
If there's nothing she can do,
what's the good in her knowing?

24:35.701 --> 24:39.911
But if she knows,
she can make different choices.

24:40.079 --> 24:42.830
She might not want to work
or have kids.

24:43.040 --> 24:46.622
She might not get married.
Might not have a life.

24:46.835 --> 24:50.417
She has to know that she can pass
this disease on to her kids.

24:50.588 --> 24:52.046
Why? So she won't have any?

24:54.549 --> 24:56.541
I love my daughter.

24:57.927 --> 25:00.382
And I can't imagine
my life without her.

25:00.554 --> 25:04.088
She's had a good life up until now.
A happy life.

25:04.766 --> 25:07.719
I'm gonna keep it that way
as long as I can.

25:09.102 --> 25:13.182
If you sign an emergency consent,
I can overturn the decision.

25:13.356 --> 25:16.273
- Doesn't DCFS have to appoint me?
- I cleared it.

25:16.483 --> 25:19.437
I don't know.
This girl's gonna die of pneumonia.

25:19.611 --> 25:22.979
- Her mother wants it.
- Her foster mother.

25:23.197 --> 25:25.818
She's had her for four years.
She's her mother.

25:26.033 --> 25:28.523
She just can't afford
the medical bills.

25:28.702 --> 25:32.034
But the state can?
How much has been spent so far?

25:32.204 --> 25:34.742
- Mark.
- All right, all right, I'll sign.

25:35.374 --> 25:37.200
- Thanks.
- Let me know how she responds.

25:37.375 --> 25:38.703
I will.

25:43.922 --> 25:45.796
Can I help you, Robert?

25:45.965 --> 25:49.464
My niece watched Sesame Street,
until she was 8.

25:49.635 --> 25:52.588
Those are the Muppets.
You need something?

25:52.804 --> 25:57.216
I came for supplies. We need
to discuss your supply management.

25:57.391 --> 26:02.301
And I find this girl's foster parent
is conspiring with DCFS and you...

26:02.479 --> 26:07.638
...to circumvent authority
and perform a procedure on a gork.

26:07.816 --> 26:11.066
She has no chance of recovery.
Is this correct?

26:12.153 --> 26:13.861
- You' re overstating it.
- Am I?

26:14.030 --> 26:19.106
She has a potentially life-threatening
infection, all she needs is a central line.

26:19.284 --> 26:22.652
And her so-called guardian
has never seen her.

26:22.828 --> 26:24.406
Well, I've seen her.

26:24.496 --> 26:27.283
We have to give appropriate care.

26:27.457 --> 26:30.872
All I'm doing is exercising a safeguard
that's built into the system.

26:31.043 --> 26:34.079
Your sympathy for her mother
overrides your clinical judgment.

26:34.630 --> 26:38.247
I disagree.
But thank you for your input.

26:42.302 --> 26:44.793
- She's not getting a central line.
- She's my patient.

26:44.971 --> 26:48.256
- Feel free to hydrate her.
- I have a second opinion.

26:48.432 --> 26:52.014
I'm the final opinion. I'm not competing
with the State Welfare Department!

26:52.185 --> 26:54.427
- It's one bureaucrat!
- He's right!

26:54.604 --> 26:58.055
It's hopeless and expensive!
Stop flogging her!

26:59.358 --> 27:02.109
Frankly, I expect more
professionalism from you!

27:02.277 --> 27:06.819
I'm supporting a parental decision!
Angie is her daughter!

27:07.031 --> 27:09.023
She's her pet!

27:09.991 --> 27:12.612
Look at her. What quality of life
do you think she has?

27:13.369 --> 27:16.239
- Robert-
- Kerry, I'm serious.

27:17.122 --> 27:19.198
No central line.

27:25.045 --> 27:27.999
- Has he always had asthma?
- Since he was 3.

27:28.173 --> 27:31.375
- I'm okay, Mom.
- You are not okay, Troy.

27:31.550 --> 27:35.382
I saw his wheezing getting worse
from the audience.

27:35.554 --> 27:36.585
Breathe.

27:37.305 --> 27:39.262
She came and pulled me off the stage.

27:39.473 --> 27:43.055
- That's no fun, is it?
- I don't ever wanna go back to school.

27:43.518 --> 27:48.808
We got a bounce-back. Collapsed
at home. Loss of consciousness.

27:48.981 --> 27:50.854
- Who?
- Grunwald.

27:51.275 --> 27:55.224
Grunwald? He was constipated.
Excuse me.

27:56.237 --> 27:58.774
- Pulse is down to 50!
- He's unresponsive.

27:58.947 --> 28:01.319
Put in a liter of saline.
See if you can get a BP.

28:01.533 --> 28:04.106
- What happened?
- He just fell over.

28:04.285 --> 28:07.321
- Get labs, cardiac enzymes.
- Pressure's 60 palp.

28:07.496 --> 28:11.327
- Mix the dopamine. He was your patient?
- Yes, abdominal pain.

28:11.499 --> 28:14.914
- ST elevations in the leads.
- History of heart disease?

28:15.127 --> 28:18.377
- No cardiac problems, right?
- His heart is fine!

28:18.546 --> 28:21.831
- He on medication?
- Codeine and what she gave him.

28:22.008 --> 28:24.463
- What was that?
- A laxative.

28:24.676 --> 28:27.345
- Bisopro. Bisoprol-
- Bisoprolol?

28:27.554 --> 28:30.044
- Yes.
- No, no. We gave him bisacodyl.

28:30.264 --> 28:34.391
- Which one was it?
- Bisoprolol. But it's not what we gave.

28:35.477 --> 28:38.927
- Hal, wake up!
- Can she wait outside, please?

28:39.146 --> 28:41.518
- Come with me.
- No, I should stay!

28:41.732 --> 28:46.642
We need to work on your husband.
Call the cath lab. Bolus heparin.

28:46.861 --> 28:48.936
What are doing?
You gave him a beta blocker?

28:49.154 --> 28:52.854
You dropped his heart rate,
pulse, and gave him an Ml.

28:53.074 --> 28:56.489
- BP's improving!
- Stand by with a nitro drip.

28:56.702 --> 28:58.362
- I didn't write the prescription.
- You said you did.

28:58.537 --> 29:01.027
- Handed it to him. I didn't write it.
- Who wrote it?

29:01.206 --> 29:04.539
The labs are back
on the transplant recipient.

29:04.709 --> 29:08.291
- Good. Get ready to move him.
- You should see this.

29:09.504 --> 29:10.832
- You're kidding?
- Nope.

29:11.005 --> 29:13.412
What should I say?
You think it's okay to tell her?

29:13.632 --> 29:17.250
- It's debatable.
- His choice is, not your obligation.

29:17.469 --> 29:22.426
This information affects her life.
I feel I have an obligation to her.

29:22.598 --> 29:26.049
Right, but she isn't your patient.
You can try to convince him.

29:26.268 --> 29:29.552
- I did try.
- Then you can't tell the daughter.

29:29.770 --> 29:32.936
Your renal failure
was caused by rhabdomyolysis.

29:33.106 --> 29:36.142
- Yeah. From muscle breakdown.
- And what caused that?

29:36.317 --> 29:38.808
- I don't know.
- I think you do.

29:40.320 --> 29:43.938
I was in a car accident.
That could've done it.

29:44.115 --> 29:46.784
- Not using drugs?
- No.

29:48.911 --> 29:50.950
You tested positive for cocaine.

29:53.248 --> 29:55.572
Sorry. I didn't know
I was this high on the list.

29:56.083 --> 29:59.534
I hardly ever do it.
I went to a party. I was depressed.

29:59.711 --> 30:02.036
- Damn dialysis.
- Get used to it.

30:02.213 --> 30:03.707
I can't have the transplant?

30:03.881 --> 30:07.664
Cocaine destroyed your kidneys.
You're still using. Why should you?

30:07.843 --> 30:12.302
- I won't do it after the operation.
- You wasted my time.

30:12.471 --> 30:16.800
Please, come on! I'm not an addict.
I need this kidney!

30:17.017 --> 30:22.093
It's viable for only a limited time.
I have an hour to get a real candidate.

30:23.147 --> 30:27.274
- You mean someone who deserves it.
- Yes.

30:27.483 --> 30:28.942
Dr. Chen?

30:32.696 --> 30:34.818
- Yes?
- This is my fiancé.

30:34.989 --> 30:36.318
- How are you?
- Good.

30:36.491 --> 30:41.567
Glen thinks Dad might be suffering from
depression. The mood swings and stuff.

30:41.745 --> 30:45.908
It might be the wedding.
I know he wanted to pay for it.

30:46.082 --> 30:49.284
- But it costs a lot of money.
- That would be tough.

30:49.459 --> 30:52.246
And Jo is his only daughter.

30:52.712 --> 30:56.460
I'll get the car.
Nice to meet you, Dr. Chen.

30:57.132 --> 30:59.171
So you think it's depression?

31:00.844 --> 31:03.132
Well, it's hard to say.

31:06.265 --> 31:08.636
- Ready to go, Dad?
- Yeah, I am.

31:11.102 --> 31:13.059
Thank you, Dr. Chen.

31:13.979 --> 31:15.770
Thanks for everything.

31:16.314 --> 31:18.271
You're welcome.

31:28.282 --> 31:29.776
Kerry?

31:30.451 --> 31:32.028
I thought Romano said no to a central line.

31:32.160 --> 31:33.191
He did.

31:33.370 --> 31:35.243
You're doing it anyway?

31:35.455 --> 31:39.748
I have emergency consent
from another physician. That's all I need.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.573
- I've got this.
- You need Opsite.

31:42.752 --> 31:44.127
I've got it.

31:44.712 --> 31:47.167
- But Kerry-
- It's my decision.

31:47.339 --> 31:49.664
It doesn't involve you.

31:52.844 --> 31:54.635
Okay.

32:10.775 --> 32:15.685
- Looks like a "P" to me. Bisoprolol.
- It's a "C." Why would I order that?

32:15.862 --> 32:17.190
What's that say, Carter?

32:18.573 --> 32:22.155
I can see how the pharmacy
could have read it wrong.

32:22.326 --> 32:24.567
- They should've called.
- Sure.

32:24.744 --> 32:27.235
- Blame them.
- It can be read both ways.

32:27.413 --> 32:29.655
You, come here.
I need an impartial observer.

32:29.873 --> 32:32.079
- That's a faxed copy-
- Quiet!

32:32.250 --> 32:35.085
- "C" or a "P"?
- It looks like a "Q."

32:35.294 --> 32:36.954
Someone else who can't read it.

32:37.171 --> 32:39.958
I prescribed bisacodyl.
That's what I ordered and wrote.

32:40.132 --> 32:44.793
Then why is this patient having
an angioplasty for an infarction?

32:45.511 --> 32:48.298
- You heard me say bisacodyl?
- Yeah.

32:49.389 --> 32:52.674
Did you read the label
before you handed it out?

32:52.850 --> 32:56.717
- There was a trauma coming in.
- Oh, a trauma came in!

32:56.937 --> 33:01.681
When traumas come in, we can hand out
any meds that are around.

33:01.857 --> 33:05.060
- Dr. Romano-
- Carter, shut up!

33:05.235 --> 33:08.401
- Can I go?
- The incompetence here is scary.

33:08.571 --> 33:10.729
- Amazing we're not shut down.
- It was an honest mistake.

33:10.906 --> 33:13.860
No, it was tag-team negligence!

33:17.453 --> 33:20.288
You are both prohibited
from writing prescriptions.

33:20.456 --> 33:25.615
- How are we going to treat patients?
- Others will write them for you.

33:26.127 --> 33:29.827
- How long?
- Until you can write and you can read.

33:30.047 --> 33:31.589
- I know how to read.
- Then do it!

33:39.888 --> 33:41.382
Thank you, Carter.

33:41.598 --> 33:43.140
Thank you, Carter.

33:48.603 --> 33:51.604
You gave him the pills
without looking at it?

33:51.814 --> 33:56.689
- What you wrote was illegible.
- I shouldn't write your scrips anyway.

33:56.860 --> 33:58.852
- I didn't ask you-
- He's your patient.

33:59.070 --> 34:03.778
You always check the label.
They teach you that on the first day.

34:07.243 --> 34:10.576
- You called UNOS?
- I had to get the next patient.

34:10.788 --> 34:14.915
Mrs. Nussbaum is coming
from upstate Indiana in 40 minutes.

34:15.083 --> 34:17.953
That's too late.
The new kidney might fail.

34:18.127 --> 34:21.626
- I thought we were at 10 hours.
- We need to do a workup.

34:21.838 --> 34:24.672
We may need to wait to anesthetize.

34:24.882 --> 34:28.251
We'll assess her.
She's already on her way.

34:28.427 --> 34:32.341
- You should've talked to me.
- We were in a hurry, we had to move on.

34:32.514 --> 34:35.882
You may not like this guy, but we have
a match who's ready for surgery.

34:36.058 --> 34:37.931
You can't be serious.

34:38.101 --> 34:42.312
I'd rather put a healthy kidney
in someone than not at all.

34:42.480 --> 34:46.347
The guy knows he's on the UNOS list
and can be called at any moment...

34:46.567 --> 34:50.777
...and he's snorting cocaine?
He's not going to stop using.

34:50.987 --> 34:52.777
He'll burn another organ.

34:52.947 --> 34:56.149
Your Mrs. Nussbaum
might not get here in time.

34:56.324 --> 34:58.945
She might not qualify.
It'll go to waste!

34:59.118 --> 35:02.119
Let it! I'd rather take the risk
than give it to him.

35:02.288 --> 35:05.323
- It's not your risk to take!
- He made his choice.

35:05.499 --> 35:07.407
Give the next person a chance.

35:10.586 --> 35:13.456
Thirty minutes.
Then I'm taking up Mr. Maldonado.

35:14.589 --> 35:18.289
- I'm not releasing him.
- I don't need you to.

35:30.560 --> 35:34.178
- She likes this one, huh?
- It's her favorite.

35:37.483 --> 35:43.235
Most doctors think she's just
responding to the light changes.

35:43.446 --> 35:45.652
But I notice a difference.

35:47.491 --> 35:49.399
At least I think I do.

35:53.704 --> 35:57.997
- Dr. Weaver put in a central line?
- I know you think it's too much.

35:59.459 --> 36:00.787
But...

36:01.669 --> 36:04.373
...I'm not ready to give her up yet.

36:07.965 --> 36:09.625
I understand.

36:11.969 --> 36:13.427
Excuse me.

36:15.096 --> 36:16.127
Thank you.

36:19.266 --> 36:20.926
You're welcome.

36:26.272 --> 36:29.557
- Strep throat ready for discharge.
- Penicillin?

36:29.733 --> 36:32.223
Yep. Curtain 3...

36:37.573 --> 36:41.155
Were my instructions
in any way unclear?

36:41.326 --> 36:45.157
- No, you made your position known.
- And you ignored it?

36:45.329 --> 36:48.993
- I took it under advisement.
- Then you're suspended.

36:49.207 --> 36:52.041
- Sign out and go home.
- Robert, let's-

36:52.209 --> 36:54.248
Right now, Kerry. Right now.

36:55.420 --> 36:59.369
- Suspended?
- Effective now, until further notice.

37:21.733 --> 37:24.188
- Carter, you going home?
- Yeah.

37:24.360 --> 37:29.105
I wish I weren't. My grandparents
are throwing a dinner party.

37:29.281 --> 37:33.278
- You have to go?
- Attendance is compulsory.

37:33.451 --> 37:35.526
- I have a question.
- Shoot.

37:35.703 --> 37:41.325
A 12-year-old has abdominal pain,
diarrhea, fever, no ill contacts.

37:41.499 --> 37:43.824
- What do you do?
- Any vomiting?

37:44.001 --> 37:47.369
- No.
- Probably gastroenteritis.

37:47.587 --> 37:49.164
Sounds like a trick question.

37:49.339 --> 37:53.964
So I'd probably order a CBC
and dip a urine to rule out a UTI.

37:54.760 --> 37:57.926
- Thought so.
- Do I pick up anything abnormal?

37:58.137 --> 38:02.798
Nothing on the CBC. And I don't know
about the urine because...

38:02.975 --> 38:04.801
...you didn't order one.

38:04.976 --> 38:07.976
You saw him last fall.
Came back today-

38:08.187 --> 38:13.263
Type Two diabetes.
Hyperosmolar coma. Cleo told me.

38:13.483 --> 38:16.152
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Should be.

38:16.319 --> 38:18.856
Been nice if we caught it earlier.

38:19.029 --> 38:21.602
Yeah, kid must not have
looked that sick.

38:21.781 --> 38:24.865
- What did I say? Stomach flu?
- Yep.

38:28.328 --> 38:31.329
I wish I could remember him.
I feel bad.

38:31.497 --> 38:32.991
Must've misdiagnosed.

38:33.165 --> 38:36.664
- He didn't have any insurance.
- Really? What are they gonna do?

38:36.877 --> 38:39.913
- They're okay. They have it now.
- Oh, good.

38:41.255 --> 38:44.090
Anything else you wanna tell me?

38:44.716 --> 38:48.548
No. I made a mistake. I'm sorry.

38:51.347 --> 38:53.173
Have a nice party.

38:54.391 --> 38:56.632
Thanks.

39:23.039 --> 39:25.660
- Hey.
- Yes, Peter?

39:25.833 --> 39:27.659
I didn't like how we left things.

39:27.751 --> 39:29.245
You mean, you screaming at me?

39:31.546 --> 39:33.917
You mind if I come in?

39:36.591 --> 39:40.291
Suit yourself.
I've got one more set.

39:48.518 --> 39:51.222
You always work out
in your living room?

39:51.979 --> 39:53.936
Beats the garage.

39:55.231 --> 39:57.058
Listen, I...

39:59.985 --> 40:02.855
I was angry that I got
dragged into this.

40:04.280 --> 40:09.404
It wasn't even a surgical patient.
Cleo, I know it gets crazy down there.

40:09.618 --> 40:12.702
I just want you to know
that I don't blame you.

40:13.579 --> 40:17.030
- Oh, you don't?
- No, I don't.

40:22.754 --> 40:25.326
- Want me to give you a hand?
- No.

40:31.552 --> 40:33.260
Come on.

40:49.108 --> 40:50.768
Am I forgiven?

40:55.530 --> 40:59.693
Peter, that was the lamest apology
I've ever heard.

41:01.034 --> 41:03.192
I gotta hit the shower.

41:08.916 --> 41:09.947
You coming?

41:43.652 --> 41:47.067
- What's next on the agenda?
- I'm building an airplane.

41:47.238 --> 41:48.613
- An airplane?
- An airplane.

41:48.823 --> 41:51.194
- Out of wood?
- Dad?

41:51.408 --> 41:53.650
- Think it'll be ready by March?
- No.

41:53.827 --> 41:56.661
Well, thanks for letting us-

42:00.207 --> 42:03.871
I'm wearing it.
I didn't wanna drag it to the can.

42:04.085 --> 42:06.540
- I didn't say anything.
- You were gonna.

42:06.712 --> 42:09.796
- Your backup oxygen's low.
- I didn't notice.

42:09.965 --> 42:13.131
- I'll go get you one.
- It'll last tonight.

42:13.301 --> 42:16.883
- I don't want to take any chances.
- Whatever you say.

42:17.679 --> 42:21.427
I made some macaroni and cheese.
There's some extra on the counter.

42:21.599 --> 42:24.932
- Thanks.
- Say, I saw Elizabeth today.

42:25.477 --> 42:26.805
She told me.

42:27.812 --> 42:32.639
Did she say anything about that place,
the hospice?

42:33.609 --> 42:36.728
I checked it out.
There weren't any spots available.

42:39.488 --> 42:44.031
- When will they have one available?
- I don't know. They didn't say.

42:44.201 --> 42:49.158
- There's a long waiting list.
- Waiting list? What's the point of that?

42:49.330 --> 42:50.824
I don't know.

42:51.707 --> 42:54.197
Looks like you're stuck with me
for a while.

42:54.375 --> 42:56.000
Yeah.

43:00.380 --> 43:03.464
Luka! What are you doing?

43:03.675 --> 43:07.209
The grease from the meat dripped
on the coals and caught on fire.

43:07.386 --> 43:10.635
- That's what the water's for.
- You didn't tell me that.

43:10.847 --> 43:13.717
- Here. What's left of it.
- Thanks.

43:13.891 --> 43:16.298
It really cooled off out here, huh?

43:17.936 --> 43:21.139
- The girls asleep?
- One is still fussing.

43:21.731 --> 43:23.106
Let me guess. Kate.

43:24.024 --> 43:27.807
- You had a 50-50 shot.
- No. She's the troublemaker.

43:29.028 --> 43:30.736
Yeah.

43:33.031 --> 43:36.281
You think these are too thick?
Might be rare inside.

43:36.451 --> 43:41.029
Well, don't worry. I have a steak
and kidney pie in the freezer.

43:41.205 --> 43:43.874
Kidney, huh? Very funny.

43:45.458 --> 43:49.669
The nurses thought
you'd take it home with you.

43:49.837 --> 43:51.295
I might as well have.

43:52.255 --> 43:54.378
You probably scared the guy
into rehab.

44:01.721 --> 44:02.836
What's wrong?

44:04.599 --> 44:06.223
What? Is that snow?

44:08.685 --> 44:11.010
Oh, man!

44:11.437 --> 44:15.766
Hello! It's April!
We can finish cooking inside.

44:15.983 --> 44:18.900
- No, I came to barbecue.
- You wanna freeze?

44:19.068 --> 44:21.606
- It's only snow.
- I'll get a sweater.

44:21.779 --> 44:24.945
- Your sweaters won't fit me.
- I'll find something.
