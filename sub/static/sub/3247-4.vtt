WEBVTT

00:10.511 --> 00:13.606
- Two minutes to curtain up, come on!
- Two minutes to curtain up.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.934
- Where's Tallulah?
- Where do you think?

00:17.434 --> 00:20.187
Hey, Tallulah, leave him alone!

00:26.944 --> 00:29.413
It's nearly show time, Laszlo,
I gotta go.

00:29.488 --> 00:31.208
Just promise me
you'll come on Sunday, okay?

00:31.281 --> 00:33.454
My mother will kill me
if she doesn't get to meet you.

00:33.575 --> 00:35.327
What if she doesn't like me?

00:35.452 --> 00:38.626
Tallulah, she'll love you
just as much as I do.

00:39.289 --> 00:42.463
Oh! You say the sweetest things.

00:42.543 --> 00:45.968
But it's true. Now promise me.
Sunday, you'll come?

00:46.880 --> 00:49.599
I promise. Cross my heart.

00:51.009 --> 00:55.890
Oh, here take this, sweetheart.
Wear it on stage and think of me.

00:57.140 --> 01:00.519
- Tallulah!
- I'm coming! Quit yelling!

01:02.521 --> 01:04.068
How do I look?

01:07.526 --> 01:09.028
Like an angel.

01:20.998 --> 01:25.219
- Wish me luck, Laszlo.
- Break a leg, sweetheart.

01:32.050 --> 01:33.643
Tallulah?

01:45.814 --> 01:47.361
Who's there?

01:57.701 --> 01:58.953
Hello?

02:00.662 --> 02:02.039
Hello?

02:22.434 --> 02:25.859
Who's there? Who are you?

03:32.337 --> 03:36.058
- Where are we?
- Ah! Smell that Atlantic breeze.

03:36.133 --> 03:39.763
Nice and cold. Lovely!
Martha, have you met my friend?

03:40.762 --> 03:44.767
Is that... Oh, my God,
that's the Statue of Liberty!

03:44.850 --> 03:47.228
Gateway to the New World.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.278
"Give me your tired, your poor"

03:49.354 --> 03:52.949
"Your huddled masses
yearning to breathe free."

03:53.024 --> 03:56.369
That's so brilliant.
I've always wanted to go to New York.

03:56.445 --> 03:59.574
I mean, the real New York,
not the new, new, new one.

03:59.656 --> 04:02.330
Well, there's the genuine article.

04:02.868 --> 04:04.791
So good, they named it twice.

04:04.870 --> 04:07.293
Mind you,
it was New Amsterdam, originally.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.500
Harder to say twice,
no wonder it didn't catch on.

04:09.624 --> 04:13.049
- New Amsterdam, New Amsterdam.
- Wonder what year it is?

04:13.128 --> 04:15.608
'Cause look, the Empire State Building's
not even finished yet.

04:15.630 --> 04:18.725
Work in progress. They've still got
a couple of ï¬‚oors to go,

04:18.841 --> 04:22.096
and if I know my history,
that makes the date somewhere around...

04:22.179 --> 04:24.147
November 1st, 1930.

04:24.639 --> 04:26.482
You're getting good at this.

04:26.558 --> 04:28.777
That's nearly 80 years ago.

04:28.852 --> 04:32.106
It's funny, 'cause you see those old
newsreels, all in black and white,

04:32.189 --> 04:35.238
like it's so far away, but here we are.

04:35.901 --> 04:37.824
It's real. It's now.

04:39.488 --> 04:41.832
Come on, you.
Where do you want go first?

04:41.907 --> 04:44.456
I think our detour just got longer.

04:44.534 --> 04:48.038
"Hooverville Mystery Deepens."
What's Hooverville?

04:51.374 --> 04:55.220
Herbert Hoover, 31st President
of the USA, came to power a year ago.

04:55.337 --> 04:58.557
Up till then, New York was a boom town,
the Roaring Twenties. And then...

04:58.632 --> 05:01.101
The Wall Street Crash, yeah.
When was that, 1929?

05:01.218 --> 05:03.266
Yeah. The whole economy
wiped out overnight.

05:03.345 --> 05:05.143
Thousands of people unemployed.

05:05.222 --> 05:08.522
All of a sudden, the huddled masses
doubled in number with nowhere to go.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.978
So they ended up here in Central Park.

05:11.061 --> 05:15.783
What, they actually live in the park?
In the middle of the city?

05:24.533 --> 05:28.583
Ordinary people lost their jobs,

05:29.663 --> 05:32.667
couldn't pay the rent,
they lost everything.

05:34.501 --> 05:39.257
There are places like this all over
America. No one's helping them.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.556
You only come to Hooverville
when there's nowhere else to go.

05:43.635 --> 05:45.808
You thieving low life!

05:46.596 --> 05:49.896
All morning I wait in the bread line
for a single loaf...

05:49.975 --> 05:51.773
I didn't touch it.

05:52.060 --> 05:55.109
- Somebody stole it from me...
- Cut that out!

05:56.106 --> 05:58.859
Cut it out, right now.

05:58.942 --> 06:01.661
- He stole my bread!
- That's enough!

06:02.112 --> 06:03.830
Did you take it?

06:03.947 --> 06:07.076
I don't know what happened,
he just went crazy.

06:07.576 --> 06:09.294
That's enough!

06:11.663 --> 06:14.758
Now, think real careful
before you lie to me.

06:16.418 --> 06:18.420
I'm starving, Solomon.

06:26.344 --> 06:30.850
We all starving.
We all got family somewhere.

06:33.768 --> 06:37.363
No stealing and no fighting.
You know the rules.

06:38.148 --> 06:43.245
Thirteen years ago, I fought
in the Great War. A lot of us did.

06:43.445 --> 06:48.121
And the only reason we got through
because we stuck together.

06:49.576 --> 06:54.548
No matter how bad things get,
we still act like human beings.

06:54.998 --> 06:56.671
It's all we got.

07:01.004 --> 07:02.221
Come on.

07:03.381 --> 07:06.510
I suppose that makes
you the boss around here.

07:07.636 --> 07:10.890
And who might you be?

07:10.972 --> 07:14.192
- He's the Doctor, I'm Martha.
- A doctor?

07:14.726 --> 07:20.483
Well, we got stockbrokers,
we've got a lawyer,

07:21.191 --> 07:23.114
but you're the first doctor.

07:23.193 --> 07:26.288
The neighbourhood gets classier
by the day.

07:26.363 --> 07:28.161
How many people live here?

07:28.239 --> 07:32.995
Any one time, hundreds.
No place else to go.

07:33.078 --> 07:36.548
But I will say this about Hooverville,
we a truly equal society.

07:36.665 --> 07:40.511
Black, white,
all the same, all starving.

07:41.044 --> 07:44.218
So you're welcome, both of you.

07:45.548 --> 07:48.643
But tell me, Doctor,
you're a man of learning, right?

07:48.718 --> 07:51.016
Explain this to me.

07:53.098 --> 07:57.478
That there is going to be
the tallest building in the world.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.813
How come they can do that

07:59.896 --> 08:03.400
and we got people starving
in the heart of Manhattan?

08:11.741 --> 08:14.494
Right, a little more.

08:14.577 --> 08:16.500
Hoist!

08:17.330 --> 08:20.083
I'm telling you
the men won't stand for it.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.586
I mean, are you out of your mind?

08:22.669 --> 08:25.673
I got five hundred men
working seven days a week.

08:25.755 --> 08:28.850
They're flat out,
and you want us to go faster?

08:28.925 --> 08:31.019
The new masters demand it.

08:31.136 --> 08:33.605
But we're on schedule.
What's the problem?

08:33.679 --> 08:35.808
Another month and we'll be done.

08:35.932 --> 08:40.438
The mast on this building
needs extra work completed by tonight.

08:40.562 --> 08:43.280
Tonight? No way. It's impossible.

08:43.398 --> 08:45.571
- That's an order.
- Yea h?

08:45.650 --> 08:50.030
Well, one word from me,
and every man on this site stops work.

08:50.113 --> 08:52.616
So go on, tell your masters that.

08:53.783 --> 08:57.378
If that's your attitude,
I think you should tell them yourself.

08:57.454 --> 09:01.584
Yeah? Well, I ain't afraid
of no man in a suit.

09:01.791 --> 09:05.045
These new bosses, what's their names?

09:05.128 --> 09:07.881
I think you could say
they're from out of town.

09:07.964 --> 09:10.843
- Italians?
- Bit further than that.

09:11.801 --> 09:15.226
- How much further?
- Beyond your imagination.

09:15.305 --> 09:18.309
Oh, what's that supposed to mean?
Who are they?

09:18.391 --> 09:21.486
Mr Diagoras, who are we working for?

09:26.816 --> 09:28.693
Behold your masters.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.336
What the hell...

09:45.418 --> 09:49.264
I have been summoned. Explain.

09:49.380 --> 09:51.178
Explain!

09:51.257 --> 09:54.602
It can talk. How does it talk?

09:55.762 --> 09:58.515
And what the hell are they?
You gotta be kidding me?

09:58.598 --> 10:00.020
I'm sorry, my lord,

10:00.100 --> 10:03.730
but this man is refusing
to complete the work.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.947
Then we must replace him.

10:06.022 --> 10:08.445
Is anybody gonna tell me
what the hell is happening here?

10:08.525 --> 10:12.996
Use him.
Take him for the final experiment.

10:13.113 --> 10:16.242
What's going on? Let go. Let go of me.

10:16.324 --> 10:19.328
Let go of me. Get off of me, you freaks!

10:19.410 --> 10:23.210
Mr Diagoras, will you tell them!
Mr Diagoras...

10:23.289 --> 10:28.386
The Empire State Building
must be completed in time.

10:29.379 --> 10:31.802
It will be, trust me.

10:31.881 --> 10:34.430
Labour is cheap
and that man can be replaced.

10:34.509 --> 10:36.352
The plan must not fail.

10:36.427 --> 10:40.307
We calculate the Gamma strike
has accelerated.

10:40.390 --> 10:44.861
- We need more bodies immediately.'
- Yes, master.

10:51.651 --> 10:55.952
So, men going missing. Is this true?

10:58.408 --> 11:00.410
It's true all right.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.210
But what does missing mean?

11:05.290 --> 11:07.088
I mean, people must come and go here
all the time.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.085
It's not like anyone's keeping
a register.

11:09.210 --> 11:10.837
Come on in.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.885
- This is different.
- In what way?

11:17.594 --> 11:20.939
Someone takes them, at night.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.437
We hear something,
someone calls out for help.

11:23.558 --> 11:27.779
By the time we get there, they're gone.
Like they vanish into thin air.

11:27.854 --> 11:30.482
And you're sure someone's taking them?

11:30.565 --> 11:34.695
Doctor, when you've got next to nothing,
you hold on to the little you got.

11:34.777 --> 11:36.996
Knife, blanket, you take it with you.

11:37.071 --> 11:40.701
You don't leave bread uneaten,
a fire still burning.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.330
Have you been to the police?

11:42.452 --> 11:46.457
Yeah, we tried that.
Another deadbeat goes missing, big deal.

11:47.790 --> 11:50.919
So the question is
who's taking them and what for?

11:51.002 --> 11:54.472
Solomon! Solomon, Mr Diagoras is here.

11:56.966 --> 12:01.688
I need men, volunteers.
I've got a little work for you.

12:01.763 --> 12:04.607
And you sure look like
you could use the money.

12:04.682 --> 12:06.855
- Yeah, what is the money?
- A dollar a day.

12:08.186 --> 12:11.565
- What's the work?
- A little trip down the sewers.

12:11.648 --> 12:15.824
Got a tunnel collapsed,
needs clearing and fixing. Any takers?

12:15.944 --> 12:19.289
- Uh-uh.
- A dollar a day is a slave wage.

12:19.364 --> 12:20.490
Yeah, yeah!

12:20.573 --> 12:23.122
And men don't always come back up,
do they?

12:23.201 --> 12:25.078
Accidents happen.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.663
What do you mean,
what sort of accidents?

12:26.746 --> 12:28.840
You don't need the work, that's fine.

12:28.957 --> 12:32.587
Anybody else? Enough with the questions.

12:32.669 --> 12:36.014
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm volunteering. I'll go.

12:36.589 --> 12:37.761
I'll kill you for this.

12:39.008 --> 12:41.010
Anybody else?

12:45.181 --> 12:49.982
Turn left, go about half a mile,
follow tunnel 273,

12:50.061 --> 12:51.984
the fall's right ahead of you.
You can't miss it.

12:52.063 --> 12:54.282
And when do we get our dollar?

12:54.857 --> 12:58.031
- When you come back up.
- And if we don't come back up?

12:58.111 --> 13:00.205
Then I got no one to pay.

13:00.280 --> 13:03.705
- Don't worry, we'll be back.
- Let's hope so.

13:07.161 --> 13:08.754
We gotta stick together.

13:08.871 --> 13:12.921
It's easy to get lost.
It's like a huge rabbit warren.

13:13.918 --> 13:16.421
You could hide an army down here.

13:19.382 --> 13:20.725
So, what about you, Frank?

13:20.842 --> 13:22.844
You're not from around these parts,
are you?

13:22.927 --> 13:25.021
Oh, you can talk.

13:25.096 --> 13:29.226
- No, I'm Tennessee, born and bred.
- So how come you're here?

13:29.350 --> 13:34.447
Oh, my Daddy died,
Momma couldn't afford to feed us all,

13:34.522 --> 13:37.071
so, I'm the oldest,
up to me to feed myself.

13:37.150 --> 13:40.120
So I put on my coat,
hitched up here on the rail roads.

13:40.194 --> 13:43.789
There's a whole lot of runaways
in the camp, younger than me

13:43.906 --> 13:47.376
from all over,
Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas.

13:47.452 --> 13:50.422
Solomon keeps a look out for us.

13:51.706 --> 13:55.631
So, what about you?
You're a long way from home.

13:55.918 --> 14:00.845
- Yeah, I'm just a hitcher, too.
- You stick with me, you'll be all right.

14:00.923 --> 14:04.268
So this Diagoras bloke, who is he, then?

14:04.385 --> 14:07.559
Couple of months ago,
he was just another foreman.

14:07.638 --> 14:11.142
Now seems like
he's running most of Manhattan.

14:11.225 --> 14:15.901
- How'd he manage that, then?
- These are strange times.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.483
A man can go from being
the king of the hill

14:18.566 --> 14:21.536
to the lowest of the low overnight.

14:21.611 --> 14:23.534
Guess for some folks,
it works the other way around.

14:23.613 --> 14:25.286
Whoa!

14:28.034 --> 14:30.457
Is it radioactive, or something?

14:34.540 --> 14:37.168
It's gone off, whatever it is.

14:39.921 --> 14:42.299
And you've got to pick it up.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.473
Shine your torch through it.

14:48.638 --> 14:53.644
Composite organic matter.
Martha, medical opinion?

14:54.185 --> 14:59.487
- It's not human, I know that.
- No. It's not.

15:00.817 --> 15:03.161
And I'll tell you something else.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.636
We must be at least half a mile in,

15:04.654 --> 15:07.578
I don't see any signs of a collapse,
do you?

15:07.657 --> 15:10.627
So why did Mr Diagoras
send us down here?

15:10.701 --> 15:12.954
Where are we now? What's up above?

15:13.037 --> 15:16.507
Well, we're right underneath Manhattan.

15:23.506 --> 15:28.012
And here, the crowning glory
of the Empire State Building,

15:28.094 --> 15:30.267
the mast itself.

15:30.346 --> 15:34.067
1,472 feet above New York.

15:34.142 --> 15:35.940
It's a beautiful thing, sir.

15:36.018 --> 15:38.612
And every single one of us
is proud of it.

15:38.688 --> 15:42.943
My wife says it's like a,
like a spire reaching into heaven.

15:43.025 --> 15:46.495
Except the gates of heaven
need a little decoration.

15:48.698 --> 15:54.546
These plates have gotta be fixed
to the mast, right to the base itself.

15:55.371 --> 15:58.671
That's okay. That's not too bad.
Shouldn't take too long.

15:58.749 --> 16:01.298
But the work has
gotta be finished tonight.

16:01.377 --> 16:03.050
- What, are you trying to kill us?
- It's not safe!

16:03.171 --> 16:04.548
We're flat out up there. Come on.

16:04.672 --> 16:06.640
Don't argue with me!

16:06.716 --> 16:08.718
But, sir, the men
can't work up there at night.

16:08.801 --> 16:12.647
It's freezing. Your hands go numb,
you lose your grip, you fall.

16:12.722 --> 16:14.474
You don't get it.

16:18.311 --> 16:22.737
If you won't work,
I can replace you like that.

16:28.237 --> 16:32.413
Now take those panels and get going.

16:41.375 --> 16:45.676
- What sort of metal is this, anyway?
- Don't ask questions. just go.

16:57.433 --> 17:01.529
I don't care how cold it is,
how tired you are,

17:01.604 --> 17:04.278
just get out there and finish the job!

17:10.320 --> 17:15.202
The conductor must be complete
for our plan to succeed.

17:17.078 --> 17:19.547
Unemployment is such an incentive.

17:19.622 --> 17:21.715
It'll get done, don't worry.

17:21.790 --> 17:25.590
Daleks have no concept of Worry.

17:25.670 --> 17:29.675
Yeah? Well, lucky you.

17:29.757 --> 17:32.601
This day is ending.

17:32.677 --> 17:37.604
Humankind is weak,
you shelter from the dark.

17:38.849 --> 17:43.195
And yet, you have built all this.

17:44.605 --> 17:46.323
That's progress.

17:46.941 --> 17:50.241
You gotta move with the times
or you get left behind.

17:50.319 --> 17:53.038
My planet is gone.

17:53.155 --> 17:55.999
Destroyed in a great war.

17:56.909 --> 18:01.460
Yet, versions of this city
stand throughout history.

18:01.539 --> 18:05.794
The human race always continues.

18:06.794 --> 18:10.890
We've had wars.
I've been a soldier myself.

18:12.133 --> 18:16.434
And I swore then I'd survive,
no matter what.

18:16.512 --> 18:19.641
You have rare ambition.

18:22.435 --> 18:28.033
I want to run this city, whatever
it takes. By any means necessary.

18:28.524 --> 18:32.245
You think like a Dalek.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.455
I '11 take that as a compliment.

18:40.202 --> 18:45.174
This human is our best option.
Bring him to me.

18:45.249 --> 18:50.301
Your loyalty will be rewarded.
Come with me.

18:55.718 --> 19:01.020
Prepare the laboratory.
The final experiment will begin!

19:01.223 --> 19:02.816
We obey.

19:18.240 --> 19:22.165
- Where are we going?
- You have been summoned by our leader.

19:22.244 --> 19:25.168
Oh, and about time, too.

20:10.793 --> 20:14.263
I bring you the human.

20:15.131 --> 20:18.761
- I take it you're in charge?
- Correct.

20:18.843 --> 20:24.475
I am Dalek Sec.
Leader of the Cult of Skaro.

20:26.142 --> 20:30.363
Then, my Lord Sec,
I am honoured to meet you.

20:31.480 --> 20:34.154
Ever since you first made
contact with me,

20:34.233 --> 20:37.328
transmitting your thoughts
into the corners of my mind,

20:37.403 --> 20:41.408
tempting me with such images,
such ideas,

20:41.490 --> 20:43.743
Oh, sir, I'd always dreamt
that together...

20:43.826 --> 20:45.828
Cease talking.

20:45.953 --> 20:47.921
I just wanna let you know
how grateful I am...

20:47.997 --> 20:49.840
I said cease!

20:50.416 --> 20:53.670
Slaves! Secure the human.

20:53.753 --> 20:56.848
But you don't need to do that,
I'm on your side.

20:56.922 --> 21:00.677
I'm working with you.
I'm your partner! I'm your friend!

21:03.220 --> 21:06.975
We're way beyond half a mile.
There's no collapse, nothing.

21:07.057 --> 21:10.231
- That Diagoras bloke, was he lying?
- Looks like it.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.354
So Why'd he want people
to come down here?

21:12.438 --> 21:14.736
Solomon, I think it's time
you took these two back.

21:14.815 --> 21:16.533
I'll be much quicker on my own.

21:18.360 --> 21:21.159
- What the hell was that?
- Hello?

21:21.238 --> 21:22.330
- Shh!
- Frank!

21:22.406 --> 21:24.625
What if it's one
of the folk gone missing?

21:24.700 --> 21:26.794
You'd be scared, half mad
down here on your own.

21:26.869 --> 21:28.416
You think they're still alive?

21:28.496 --> 21:32.091
Heck, we ain't seen no bodies down here.
Maybe they just got lost.

21:34.919 --> 21:36.762
I never heard nobody
make a sound like that.

21:36.837 --> 21:38.805
Where's it coming from?

21:42.718 --> 21:44.220
Sounds like
there's more than one of them.

21:44.345 --> 21:47.724
- This way?
- No, that way.

21:51.227 --> 21:52.570
Doctor.

21:59.485 --> 22:01.112
Who are you?

22:02.696 --> 22:04.573
Are you lost?

22:06.617 --> 22:08.540
Can you understand me?

22:10.037 --> 22:12.460
I've been thinking about
folk lost down here.

22:12.540 --> 22:16.966
It's all right, Frank, just stay back.
Let me have a look.

22:19.046 --> 22:21.925
He's got a point, though, my mate Frank.

22:22.383 --> 22:25.262
I'd hate to be stuck down here
on my own.

22:26.637 --> 22:32.815
We know the way out. Daylight.
If you come with us.

22:36.856 --> 22:39.905
Oh, but what are you?

22:39.984 --> 22:43.614
Is that some kind of carnival mask?

22:43.737 --> 22:45.364
No, it's real.

22:48.617 --> 22:50.039
I'm sorry.

22:51.996 --> 22:56.297
But listen to me. I promise I can help.

22:57.626 --> 22:59.128
Who did this to you?

22:59.211 --> 23:02.681
Doctor,
I think you'd better get back here.

23:04.550 --> 23:08.305
- Doctor!
- Actually, good point.

23:09.805 --> 23:13.400
- They're following you.
- Yeah, I noticed that, thanks.

23:15.019 --> 23:18.023
Right, then, Martha, Frank, Solomon.

23:18.606 --> 23:22.986
- What?
- I think, um, basically,

23:23.485 --> 23:25.362
Tun!

23:35.122 --> 23:37.716
- Where are we going?
- This way!

23:47.051 --> 23:49.600
There's a ladder. Come on!

23:59.104 --> 24:00.481
Frank!

24:12.117 --> 24:14.245
- Come on, Frank.
- Come on.

24:15.663 --> 24:17.165
I got you.

24:17.247 --> 24:20.217
Come on! Come on!

24:20.292 --> 24:23.216
- Come on!
- Frank!

24:23.337 --> 24:25.886
- Frank!
- No!

24:28.801 --> 24:30.724
- We can't go after him.
- I've got to go back down!

24:30.803 --> 24:34.683
- We can't just leave him.
- No, I'm not losing anybody else!

24:34.765 --> 24:36.813
Those creatures were from hell!
From hell itself!

24:36.892 --> 24:41.318
If we go after him, they'll take us all!
There's nothing we can do.

24:42.481 --> 24:43.949
I'm sorry.

24:44.566 --> 24:47.194
All right then, put 'em up!

24:48.737 --> 24:51.866
Hands in the air and no funny business.

24:52.616 --> 24:55.495
Now, tell me, you shmucks,

24:55.744 --> 24:58.088
what have you done with Laszlo?

24:59.289 --> 25:02.293
- Who's Laszlo?
- Laszlo's my boyfriend.

25:03.460 --> 25:06.259
Was my boyfriend
until he disappeared two weeks ago.

25:06.338 --> 25:08.887
No letter, no goodbye, no nothing.

25:09.299 --> 25:13.896
And I'm not stupid. I know some guys
are just pigs, but not my Laszlo.

25:13.971 --> 25:16.895
I mean, what kind of guy asks you
to meet his mom before he vamooses?

25:16.974 --> 25:19.944
Might... might just help
if you put that down.

25:20.019 --> 25:21.521
Huh?

25:22.271 --> 25:23.363
Oh, sure.

25:24.648 --> 25:27.572
Oh, come on, it's not real.
It's just a prop.

25:27.651 --> 25:31.531
- It was either that or a spear.
- What do you think happened to Laszlo?

25:31.613 --> 25:36.414
I wish I knew. One minute he's there,
the next, zip, vanished.

25:36.493 --> 25:38.996
- Listen, what was your name?
- Tallulah.

25:39.121 --> 25:41.169
- Tallulah.
- Three "I's" and an

25:41.248 --> 25:44.843
Right. We can try and find Laszlo,
but he's not the only one.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.837
There are people disappearing
every night.

25:46.920 --> 25:51.096
And there are creatures.
Such creatures...

25:52.134 --> 25:55.434
- What do you mean, creatures?
- Look, listen, just trust me.

25:55.512 --> 25:59.892
Everyone is in danger.
I need to find out exactly what this is.

26:00.726 --> 26:03.821
Because then I'll know exactly
what we're fighting.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.364
Yeuch!

26:13.697 --> 26:18.453
- How about this? I found it backstage.
- Perfect.

26:18.827 --> 26:20.670
It's the capacitors I need.

26:20.788 --> 26:24.258
I'm just rigging up a crude, little
DNA scan for this beastie.

26:24.333 --> 26:27.086
If I can get a chromosomal reading,
I can find out where it's from.

26:27.169 --> 26:30.264
How about you, Doctor?
Where are you from?

26:30.339 --> 26:34.435
I been all over, I never heard
anybody talk like you.

26:34.510 --> 26:36.478
Just exactly who are you?

26:36.553 --> 26:40.808
- Oh, I'm just sort of passing by.
- I'm not a fool, Doctor.

26:42.726 --> 26:45.149
No. Sorry.

26:54.238 --> 26:56.161
I was scared, Doctor.

26:57.699 --> 27:02.375
I let 'em take Frank
'cause I was just so scared.

27:06.500 --> 27:08.298
I got to get back to Hooverville.

27:08.377 --> 27:10.971
With these creatures on the loose,
we gotta protect ourselves.

27:11.046 --> 27:13.765
- And no one else gonna help us.
- Good luck.

27:15.384 --> 27:19.264
I hope you find what you're looking for,
for all our sakes.

27:23.725 --> 27:27.650
Laszlo, he'd wait for me after the show.

27:27.729 --> 27:30.733
Walk me home, like I was a lady.

27:30.858 --> 27:32.986
He'd leave a flower for me
on my dressing table.

27:33.068 --> 27:35.321
Every day, just a single rosebud.

27:35.404 --> 27:37.873
Haven't you reported him missing?

27:37.948 --> 27:41.748
Sure, but heâ€™s just a stagehand,
who cares?

27:41.827 --> 27:45.377
- The management certainly don't.
- Can't you kick up a fuss or something?

27:45.455 --> 27:47.128
Okay, so then they fire me.

27:47.207 --> 27:50.757
But they'd listen to you,
you're one of the stars.

27:50.878 --> 27:54.473
Oh, honey, I got one song
in a back-street revue,

27:54.548 --> 27:56.628
and that's only
'cause Heidi Chicane broke her ankle,

27:56.633 --> 27:59.432
which had nothing to do with me
whatever anybody says.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.855
I can't afford to make a fuss.

28:02.681 --> 28:03.853
If I don't make this month's rent,

28:03.932 --> 28:05.980
then before you know it,
I'm in Hooverville.

28:06.059 --> 28:08.187
Okay, I get it.

28:08.312 --> 28:10.360
It's the Depression, sweetie.

28:10.439 --> 28:12.692
Your heart might break,
but the show goes on,

28:12.774 --> 28:15.277
'cause if it stops, you starve.

28:15.944 --> 28:18.322
Every night I have to go out there,

28:18.405 --> 28:23.286
sing, dance, keep going,
hoping he's gonna come back.

28:25.579 --> 28:26.956
I'm sorry.

28:29.333 --> 28:33.634
Hey, you're lucky, though.
You got yourself a forward-thinking guy

28:33.712 --> 28:39.014
- with that hot potato in the sharp suit.
- Oh, he's not... We're not together.

28:39.134 --> 28:43.560
Oh, sure you are. I've seen the way
you look at him. It's obvious.

28:43.639 --> 28:45.186
Not to him.

28:46.141 --> 28:51.523
Oh, I should have realised.
He's into musical theatre, huh?

28:51.605 --> 28:55.735
What a waste.
Still, you gotta live in hope.

28:55.817 --> 29:00.323
It's the only thing that's kept me
going, 'cause, well, look.

29:01.281 --> 29:04.000
On my dressing table every day still.

29:04.826 --> 29:07.875
- Do you think it's Laszlo?
- I don't know.

29:07.955 --> 29:10.333
If he's still around,
why is he being all secret,

29:10.415 --> 29:13.009
like he doesn't want me to see him?

29:15.587 --> 29:19.717
The stories are true.
People are being taken.

29:19.841 --> 29:22.185
We lost Frank today.

29:23.011 --> 29:27.892
He was stolen from right in front of me,
but no more. I swear to you, no more!

29:28.392 --> 29:32.898
Now, I made a pledge that this place
would be a peaceful place,

29:33.021 --> 29:35.865
but now it's time to take up arms.

29:35.941 --> 29:37.033
Yeah!

29:37.109 --> 29:40.409
We need weapons.
We need sentries on duty.

29:40.487 --> 29:42.785
We need men prepared to fight.

29:42.864 --> 29:48.837
We got to protect ourselves, 'cause you
know no one else will. Now get moving!

29:49.204 --> 29:51.298
Arm yourselves, come on!

29:51.373 --> 29:52.545
Yeah!

30:07.014 --> 30:09.312
I can't feel my fingers.

30:14.062 --> 30:17.692
We can't stay here for much longer.
We'll fall.

30:18.734 --> 30:20.907
Come on, we're nearly done.

30:29.494 --> 30:32.794
The chromatin solution is ready.

30:32.873 --> 30:36.002
Then our preparations are complete.

30:36.084 --> 30:38.678
What are you doing?
Preparations for what?

30:38.754 --> 30:42.600
This is the final experiment.

30:42.716 --> 30:46.937
What do you mean?
Do you mean like those pig-men things?

30:47.429 --> 30:50.433
You're not gonna turn me into
one of those. Oh, God, please don't!

30:50.515 --> 30:53.359
The Pig Slaves are primitive.

30:53.435 --> 30:57.941
The final experiment is greater by far.

30:59.941 --> 31:02.444
But how does that involve me?

31:02.527 --> 31:07.124
We need your flesh. Bring him to me.

31:07.741 --> 31:13.293
Halt! This action contradicts
the Dalek imperative.

31:13.580 --> 31:16.459
Daleks are supreme. Humans are weak.

31:16.541 --> 31:21.889
But there are millions of humans
and only four of us.

31:21.963 --> 31:26.810
If we are supreme,
why are we not victorious?

31:28.970 --> 31:35.398
The Cult of Skaro was created
by the Emperor for this very purpose,

31:35.477 --> 31:39.903
to imagine new ways of survival.

31:39.981 --> 31:42.279
But we must remain pure.

31:42.359 --> 31:47.957
No, Dalek 7' ha y!
Our purity has brought us to extinction!

31:48.865 --> 31:52.244
We must adapt to survive.

31:52.369 --> 31:56.294
You have all made sacrifices.

31:56.373 --> 32:02.801
And now! will sacrifice myself
for the greater cause,

32:03.338 --> 32:09.562
for the future of Dalek-kind.
Now bring me the human!

32:09.678 --> 32:13.774
But I don't understand.
What do you mean? Get off of me.

32:13.849 --> 32:18.150
Behold the true Dalek form.

32:22.023 --> 32:26.574
Now join with me.

32:27.195 --> 32:33.077
No! Get off me!
I did everything you asked of me! No!

32:47.883 --> 32:52.013
That's it, just need to heat you up.

33:00.187 --> 33:02.440
Girls, it's show time!

33:02.522 --> 33:04.775
Lois, you spoil my sashay tonight,

33:04.858 --> 33:07.577
- I'm gonna punch you.
- Quit complaining, Myrna.

33:07.652 --> 33:10.826
- Go buy yourself some glasses.
- Come on, honey, take a look.

33:10.906 --> 33:15.662
- Ever been on stage before?
- Oh, little bit, you know, Shakespeare.

33:15.744 --> 33:18.873
How dull is that?
Come and see a real show!

33:23.793 --> 33:25.761
This is artificial!

33:27.422 --> 33:29.845
Ladies and gentlemen...

33:29.925 --> 33:31.973
They genetically engineered it.

33:34.346 --> 33:37.225
Whoever this is, oh, you're clever.

33:37.933 --> 33:40.937
With Heaven and Hell.

33:56.576 --> 34:00.297
â™ª You lured me in
with your cold grey eyes

34:00.372 --> 34:04.377
â™ª Your simple smile
your bewitching lies

34:04.459 --> 34:08.054
â™ª One and one and one is three

34:08.129 --> 34:10.973
â™ª My bad, bad angel

34:11.049 --> 34:13.973
â™ª The devil and me

34:14.344 --> 34:18.099
â™ª You put the devil in me

34:18.181 --> 34:21.435
â™ª You put the devil in me

34:21.976 --> 34:25.527
â™ª You put the devil in me

34:27.274 --> 34:29.697
â™ª My bad, bad angel

34:29.775 --> 34:32.199
â™ª You put the devil in me â™ª

34:48.503 --> 34:51.177
What are you doing?

35:03.059 --> 35:07.815
- What are you doing?
- You're on my tail. Get off my tail!

35:08.189 --> 35:13.195
Fundamental DNA type 467-989.

35:14.529 --> 35:18.750
989. Hold on,
now that means planet of origin...

35:23.496 --> 35:24.713
Skaro.

35:27.125 --> 35:31.050
- Get off the stage, you're spoiling it.
- But look, over there!

35:35.425 --> 35:36.677
Hey!

35:40.055 --> 35:41.648
Wait!

35:43.642 --> 35:46.737
But you're different to the others.
Just wait.

35:51.274 --> 35:53.402
It was like something
out of a movie show.

35:53.485 --> 35:56.238
Oh, that face.
I ain't never gonna sleep.

35:56.321 --> 35:59.450
- Where is she? Where's Martha?
- I don't know. She ran off the stage.

36:09.959 --> 36:11.381
Martha!

36:17.425 --> 36:20.395
- Oh, where are you going?
- They've taken her.

36:20.470 --> 36:23.690
Who's taken her? What are you doing?

36:24.557 --> 36:27.561
I said what the hell are you doing?

36:28.186 --> 36:29.688
Crazy guy...

36:34.776 --> 36:37.029
No, no, no, no way. You're not coming.

36:37.112 --> 36:39.911
- Tell me what's going on.
- There's nothing you can do, go back.

36:39.989 --> 36:43.744
Look, whoever's taken Martha they could
have taken Laszlo, couldn't they?

36:43.827 --> 36:47.798
- Tallulah, you're not safe down here.
- Then that's my problem.

36:47.914 --> 36:50.087
Come on. Which way?

36:53.128 --> 36:54.971
This way.

36:58.842 --> 37:00.844
Let me go!

37:05.515 --> 37:09.019
- Martha.
- You're alive.

37:13.398 --> 37:17.949
Oh, I thought we'd lost you.
All right, all right, we're moving!

37:18.653 --> 37:20.576
- Where are they taking us?
- I don't know.

37:20.655 --> 37:22.657
But we can find out
what's going on down here.

37:26.119 --> 37:30.920
When you say they've taken her,
who's they, exactly?

37:30.999 --> 37:33.093
And who are you, anyway? I never asked.

37:33.168 --> 37:34.590
- Shh.
- Okay, okay.

37:34.669 --> 37:36.012
Shh!

37:39.549 --> 37:40.949
I mean, you're a handsome enough...

38:02.030 --> 38:04.704
No, no, no.

38:09.454 --> 38:13.709
They survive. They always survive,
while I lose everything.

38:15.210 --> 38:18.384
That metal thing, what was it?

38:20.256 --> 38:22.099
It's called a Dalek.

38:23.051 --> 38:25.895
- And it's not just metal, it's alive.
- You're kidding me.

38:25.970 --> 38:28.098
Do I look like I'm kidding?

38:30.892 --> 38:34.613
Inside that shell
there's a creature born to hate,

38:34.729 --> 38:36.823
who's only thought
is to destroy everything

38:36.898 --> 38:39.572
and everyone that isn't a Dalek too.

38:41.402 --> 38:45.077
They won't stop until it's killed
every human being alive.

38:45.198 --> 38:48.122
But if that's not a human being,

38:48.201 --> 38:52.126
that kind of implies
it's from outer space.

38:53.873 --> 38:57.594
Yet again, that's a no with the kidding.
Oy!

38:58.878 --> 39:02.257
Well, what's it doing here in New York?

39:04.843 --> 39:09.269
Stop the process. Dalek Sec is failing!

39:09.347 --> 39:14.729
No! The experiment must continue.

39:15.228 --> 39:18.027
Administer the solution!

39:18.857 --> 39:21.827
We must evolve.

39:21.943 --> 39:26.039
Evolve! Evolve!

39:26.239 --> 39:29.360
Every second you're down here, you're in
danger. I'm taking you back right now.

39:31.369 --> 39:34.498
Where's Martha?
What have you done with her?

39:35.748 --> 39:39.423
- What have you clone with Martha?
- I didn't take her.

39:39.502 --> 39:42.881
- Can you remember your name?
- Don't look at me.

39:44.799 --> 39:48.554
- Do you know where she is?
- Stay back! Don't look at me.

39:48.636 --> 39:51.731
- What happened to you?
- They made me a monster.

39:51.806 --> 39:54.275
- Who did?
- The masters.

39:54.350 --> 39:57.024
The Daleks. Why?

39:57.103 --> 39:59.071
They needed slaves.

40:00.815 --> 40:02.909
They needed slaves to steal more people,

40:02.984 --> 40:07.581
so they created us,
part animal, part human.

40:08.781 --> 40:13.662
I escaped before they got my mind
but it was still too late.

40:14.662 --> 40:17.290
Do you know what happened to Martha?

40:18.291 --> 40:23.218
They took her. It's my fault,
she was following me.

40:23.713 --> 40:25.841
Were you in the theatre?

40:25.924 --> 40:27.642
I never...

40:28.760 --> 40:31.980
- Yes.
- Why? Why were you there?

40:32.055 --> 40:34.604
I never wanted you to see me like this.

40:34.682 --> 40:38.482
Why me? What I got to do with this?

40:39.395 --> 40:42.774
Were you following me?
Is that why you were there?

40:46.027 --> 40:47.529
Yes.

40:51.157 --> 40:54.161
- Who are you?
- I was lonely.

40:54.994 --> 40:58.168
- Who are you?
- I needed to see you.

40:58.289 --> 41:00.337
Who are you?

41:02.460 --> 41:05.009
- I'm sorry.
- No, wait.

41:07.507 --> 41:09.726
Let me look at you.

41:18.476 --> 41:20.069
Laszlo?

41:21.396 --> 41:23.023
My Laszlo?

41:24.857 --> 41:27.701
What have they done to you?

41:28.653 --> 41:31.623
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

41:33.199 --> 41:37.579
- Laszlo, can you show me where they are?
- But they'll kill you.

41:37.662 --> 41:40.666
If I don't stop them,
they'll kill everyone.

41:46.587 --> 41:48.214
Then follow me.

41:51.843 --> 41:55.188
- What are they keeping us here for?
- I don't know.

41:55.263 --> 41:57.263
Got a nasty feeling we're being
kept in the larder.

42:02.854 --> 42:05.107
What are they doing? What's wrong?
What's wrong?

42:05.189 --> 42:08.159
Silence! Silence!

42:09.777 --> 42:11.654
What the hell is that?

42:14.282 --> 42:17.786
You will form a line! Move! Move!

42:17.952 --> 42:20.501
Just do what it says, everyone, okay?
Just obey.

42:20.580 --> 42:24.960
The female is wise. Obey!

42:25.084 --> 42:29.055
- Report!
- These are strong specimens.

42:29.130 --> 42:31.633
They will help the Dalek cause.

42:31.799 --> 42:32.846
Dale k.

42:32.925 --> 42:36.646
What is the status
of the final experiment?

42:36.721 --> 42:42.273
The Dalekenium is in place.
The energy conductor is now complete.

42:42.769 --> 42:46.319
Then I will extract prisoners
for selection.

42:47.607 --> 42:50.986
Intelligence scan - initiate.

42:52.987 --> 42:57.834
Reading brainwaves. Low intelligence.

42:58.034 --> 43:00.332
- You calling me stupid?
- Silence!

43:00.411 --> 43:03.585
This one will become a Pig Slave. Next.

43:03.664 --> 43:06.383
No, let go of me!
I'm not becoming one of them.

43:06.459 --> 43:08.177
No, let me go!

43:08.252 --> 43:12.007
Intelligence scan - initiate.

43:12.632 --> 43:17.638
They're divided into two groups:
high intelligence and low intelligence.

43:18.054 --> 43:22.355
The low intelligence are taken
to become Pig Slaves, like me.

43:22.558 --> 43:24.686
- But that's not fair!
- Shh!

43:24.769 --> 43:26.771
You're the smartest guy I ever dated.

43:26.854 --> 43:30.108
- And the others?
- They' re taken to the laboratory.

43:30.191 --> 43:33.161
- Why? What for?
- I don't know.

43:34.195 --> 43:38.120
The masters only call it
the final experiment.

43:38.324 --> 43:40.543
Superior intelligence.

43:42.078 --> 43:45.753
Intelligence scan - initiate.

43:47.375 --> 43:50.174
Superior intelligence.

43:50.253 --> 43:54.224
This one will become pan'
of the final experiment.

43:54.298 --> 43:57.973
You can't just experiment on people.
It's insane! It's inhuman!

43:58.052 --> 44:00.305
We are not human.

44:02.723 --> 44:08.571
Prisoners of high intelligence will be
taken to the Transgenic Laboratory.

44:09.564 --> 44:11.658
Look out, they're moving.

44:14.193 --> 44:15.820
Doctor. Doctor, quickly!

44:15.903 --> 44:17.871
I'm not coming.
I've got an idea. You go.

44:17.947 --> 44:20.666
- Laszlo, come on.
- Can you remember the way?

44:20.741 --> 44:22.743
- Yeah, I think so.
- Then go, please.

44:22.827 --> 44:24.204
But, Laszlo, you've got to come with me.

44:24.287 --> 44:25.914
Where would I go?

44:26.164 --> 44:30.260
Tallulah, I'm begging you.
Just save yourself, just run. just go!

44:31.627 --> 44:32.844
Go.

44:44.348 --> 44:47.602
- Keep walking.
- I am so glad to see you.

44:47.727 --> 44:52.403
Yeah, well, you can kiss me later.
You, too, Frank, if you want.

45:28.809 --> 45:30.186
Report!

45:30.311 --> 45:34.908
Dalek Sec is entering
the final stage of evolution.

45:34.982 --> 45:38.407
Scan him. Prepare for birth.

45:38.486 --> 45:39.988
Evolution?

45:40.071 --> 45:42.324
What's wrong with
old Charlie Boy over there?

45:42.406 --> 45:46.331
- Ask them.
- What, me? Don't be daft.

45:46.702 --> 45:50.707
I don't exactly want to get noticed.
Ask them what's going on.

45:54.919 --> 45:57.718
Daleks, I demand to be told.

45:58.089 --> 46:01.468
What is this final experiment?

46:02.843 --> 46:04.015
Report!

46:04.387 --> 46:08.187
- You will bear witness.
- To what?

46:08.516 --> 46:12.146
This is the dawn of a new age.

46:13.729 --> 46:15.197
What does that mean?

46:15.273 --> 46:19.449
We are the only four Daleks
in existence.

46:19.527 --> 46:22.155
So the species must evolve.

46:22.238 --> 46:25.538
A life outside the shell.

46:25.616 --> 46:29.871
The children of Skaro must walk again.

47:02.069 --> 47:03.662
What is it?

47:15.207 --> 47:20.839
I am a human Dalek.

47:22.131 --> 47:26.136
I am your future.

48:20.981 --> 48:22.574
Move, move, move, move, move!

48:22.650 --> 48:24.243
Come on, everyone up, come on!

48:24.652 --> 48:28.031
Daleks are bad enough at any time,
but right now they're vulnerable.

48:28.114 --> 48:29.957
That makes them
more dangerous than ever.

48:30.074 --> 48:32.122
Monsters! They're monsters!

48:32.201 --> 48:33.248
It's started.

48:34.620 --> 48:35.837
Got to gel' everyone out.

48:35.913 --> 48:37.790
Hooverville's the lowest place
a man can fall,

48:37.873 --> 48:39.295
there's no where else to go.

48:39.375 --> 48:42.003
- Oh, my God.
- Take aim.

48:47.633 --> 48:49.226
Exterminate.
