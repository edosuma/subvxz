WEBVTT

00:05.214 --> 00:06.455
Hey, what you reading?

00:06.882 --> 00:07.747
A magazine.

00:07.966 --> 00:10.174
Oh. Making a collage for school?

00:10.511 --> 00:11.922
No, just reading it.

00:12.679 --> 00:13.795
Look at that.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.597
Maybe Sheldon isn't
the only bookworm around here.

00:16.808 --> 00:17.719
Which magazine?

00:17.935 --> 00:19.642
<i>- Cosmopolitan.</i>
- What?

00:19.853 --> 00:21.515
It's a magazine
for today's woman.

00:23.232 --> 00:25.645
Hey! I was about to find out
what turns a man on.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.100
Where'd you get this?

00:27.319 --> 00:29.436
Heather. I traded
a Fruit Roll-Up for it.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.858
- Well, this is going in the garbage.<i>
- You sure?</i>

00:32.073 --> 00:34.691
It's got some great tips on
how to spice up your marriage.

00:35.619 --> 00:37.485
My marriage is fine, thank you.

00:37.704 --> 00:40.572
And you are not to bring filth
like this into our house again.

00:40.791 --> 00:42.578
That's not fair.
Sheldon reads dirty stuff

00:42.793 --> 00:44.500
all the time,
and you don't say anything.

00:44.711 --> 00:45.918
He does not.

00:46.129 --> 00:47.745
Check out the comic book
on his desk.

00:52.427 --> 00:53.508
<i>What?</i>

00:53.720 --> 00:54.881
Oh, my goodness.

00:55.639 --> 00:56.550
<i>Oh.</i>

00:57.140 --> 00:58.347
Oh, my.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.142
<i>Hold on. No. No.</i>

01:01.353 --> 01:04.346
Th-This blue man's backside
is all over the place.

01:04.565 --> 01:07.273
On page 112, you get to see
his front side.

01:08.569 --> 01:09.935
Oh!

01:12.614 --> 01:14.401
- I'll be back.
- Where you going?

01:14.658 --> 01:16.194
To give the owner
of that comic book store

01:16.410 --> 01:18.367
- a piece of my mind!
- Cool.

01:18.787 --> 01:20.619
And then I'm calling
Heather's mom!

01:21.415 --> 01:22.701
Aw.

01:51.278 --> 01:53.611
Are there any
Vietnamese superheroes?

01:54.197 --> 01:55.654
There's one called
Half-Face.

01:56.408 --> 01:57.239
Why?

01:57.743 --> 02:00.076
The communist government
forced him to build bombs,

02:00.287 --> 02:02.074
and one blew off
half his face.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.621
The left half or the right half?

02:04.916 --> 02:06.032
The bottom half.

02:06.585 --> 02:07.701
That's an important half.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.085
Excuse me.
Did you sell this to my son?

02:13.300 --> 02:14.507
I don't know.
Who's your son?

02:14.718 --> 02:16.300
The little boy in the corner.

02:18.764 --> 02:20.881
- Which one?
- Sheldon Cooper.

02:21.099 --> 02:23.341
Oh. Yeah.

02:24.269 --> 02:25.100
Look at him!

02:25.312 --> 02:27.679
He is the same size as
one of the dolls you sell here.

02:27.981 --> 02:28.812
Those are action figures.

02:29.024 --> 02:30.811
Where is your sense
of responsibility?

02:31.318 --> 02:32.559
Have you looked
inside this book?

02:32.778 --> 02:33.393
Because I have.

02:33.612 --> 02:34.773
<i>At that moment,</i>

02:34.988 --> 02:38.106
<i>I felt a subtle heat
rising through my body.</i>

02:38.325 --> 02:40.533
<i>I was used to being humiliated
by my siblings</i>

02:40.744 --> 02:42.827
<i>on a daily basis,
but from my mother?</i>

02:43.246 --> 02:44.737
<i>This was new territory.</i>

02:44.956 --> 02:47.243
Mom, you're embarrassing me.

02:48.210 --> 02:48.950
Oh, is that right?

02:49.169 --> 02:50.580
Well, guess what.
I don't care.

02:50.796 --> 02:52.253
And if I catch you
doing it again,

02:52.464 --> 02:54.877
I'll be back with my husband;
he is way scarier than me.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.007
- I doubt that.
- Let's go.

02:57.552 --> 02:58.884
But I came here with Tam.

02:59.262 --> 03:00.798
Tam, you coming or not?

03:01.390 --> 03:02.346
I'm good.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.731
As you can see,
I'm not related to them.

03:20.283 --> 03:21.444
<i>And in local weather,</i>

03:21.660 --> 03:24.528
<i>the tornado watch issued Tuesday
is still in effect for the area.</i>

03:24.746 --> 03:27.409
<i>Stay right here for updates
as we get 'em.</i>

03:28.500 --> 03:30.412
I don't understand why
you'd even be interested

03:30.627 --> 03:31.492
in a book like that.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.294
One of the characters
is a scientist

03:33.505 --> 03:35.041
who worked on
the Manhattan Project.

03:35.257 --> 03:37.499
Well, it's filled with
violence and nudity,

03:37.718 --> 03:39.209
and you are done looking at it.

03:39.761 --> 03:40.968
But comics are a form of art.

03:41.179 --> 03:42.545
You wouldn't forbid me
from looking

03:42.764 --> 03:44.881
at Michelangelo's David
just because he's nude.

03:45.100 --> 03:47.012
When a statue
of your naked blue fella

03:47.227 --> 03:48.934
is on display at the Vatican,
we'll talk.

03:49.271 --> 03:52.435
Actually, David is at the
Accademia Gallery in Florence.

03:52.691 --> 03:55.650
Doesn't matter. I don't want you
looking at his bottom either.

03:58.697 --> 03:59.437
Where's Mom?

03:59.656 --> 04:02.239
Chewing out the guy
who runs the comic book store.

04:02.451 --> 04:03.066
Why?

04:03.285 --> 04:04.867
She found
an inappropriate comic

04:05.078 --> 04:07.195
that Sheldon had
and went ballistic.

04:07.414 --> 04:08.871
She also took my <i>Cosmo.</i>

04:09.916 --> 04:10.997
What's a <i>Cosmo?</i>

04:11.334 --> 04:13.200
A magazine for
today's woman.

04:13.545 --> 04:14.410
Sucks for you.

04:14.629 --> 04:18.623
You know, if I had something in
my room she might disapprove of,

04:19.091 --> 04:20.583
I might be looking
for a real good hiding place

04:20.802 --> 04:22.043
right about now.

04:22.763 --> 04:23.924
I think I'm okay.

04:24.639 --> 04:25.629
Your air vent?

04:31.313 --> 04:32.349
Boys are dumb.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.765
D-U-M-B.

04:36.026 --> 04:37.233
Dumb-a?

04:48.163 --> 04:48.903
What are you doing?

04:49.873 --> 04:51.205
Confiscating your comic books.

04:51.416 --> 04:53.203
You can have them back
when you're 18.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.250
You're taking
Casper the Friendly Ghost?

04:55.629 --> 04:57.746
Ghosts are sacrilegious.
Nothing friendly about that.

04:58.507 --> 04:59.588
Very well.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.587
There's one more book
that belongs in the box,

05:01.802 --> 05:06.797
filled with adultery, genocide,
and even human sacrifice.

05:08.350 --> 05:09.682
You think you're so smart.

05:09.893 --> 05:13.637
I do. And yet you continue
to treat me like a child.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.021
You know what?

05:16.233 --> 05:18.600
You want me to treat you
like an adult, you got it.

05:18.819 --> 05:21.277
From this moment on,
I am done mommy-ing you.

05:22.155 --> 05:25.319
Wonderful. Does that mean
I can have my comic books back?

05:25.784 --> 05:28.322
Comic books are for children.
You're an adult.

05:36.962 --> 05:40.376
<i>My new adult
responsibilities began that night.</i>

05:40.590 --> 05:42.627
<i>Luckily, a cookbook
is nothing more</i>

05:42.843 --> 05:44.254
<i>than a set of instructions.</i>

05:44.469 --> 05:46.176
<i>And if there's one thing
I shine at,</i>

05:46.388 --> 05:47.845
<i>it's following instructions.</i>

05:51.226 --> 05:52.433
Aw.

05:54.479 --> 05:57.142
What's Sheldon doing?

05:57.357 --> 05:59.599
- Cooking his own dinner.
- Why?

05:59.818 --> 06:01.775
He wants to take care
of himself like an adult.

06:01.987 --> 06:04.570
I plan on putting that off
for as long as possible.

06:04.990 --> 06:06.777
Really? It's a plan?

06:08.326 --> 06:10.067
Maybe I should go
keep an eye on him.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.199
No. Let him handle this
on his own.

06:12.414 --> 06:13.621
I wouldn't mind watching.

06:13.832 --> 06:15.539
Let's just say grace.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.037
I can't. I got to go in there.

06:18.253 --> 06:19.118
If she's going, I'm going.

06:19.337 --> 06:20.544
No one's going anywhere.

06:20.755 --> 06:22.041
If he needs help,
he can ask.

06:22.257 --> 06:23.623
<i>I don't need help!</i>

06:24.259 --> 06:25.670
<i>Everything's under control!</i>

06:28.680 --> 06:30.216
You're really holding
the line on this one.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.469
I'm sorry,
but he just pushed my buttons.

06:32.684 --> 06:35.097
Don't be sorry.
I'm diggin' it.

06:35.312 --> 06:36.553
- Ew.
- Gross.

06:36.771 --> 06:37.761
I agree.

06:38.690 --> 06:39.601
Pretty gross.

06:43.528 --> 06:44.439
Y'all are mean.

06:48.033 --> 06:49.194
How was your chicken?

06:49.576 --> 06:52.990
Not bad. The dish soap
gave it a nice lemony flavor.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.825
All right, bedtime.

06:56.041 --> 06:57.998
- Night, Mama.
<i>- Night, baby.</i>

06:58.209 --> 06:59.370
Have sweet dreams.

06:59.586 --> 07:00.918
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

07:02.964 --> 07:05.251
Sheldon, I assume you don't
need to be tucked in?

07:05.467 --> 07:07.709
I can handle it,
thank you.

07:16.186 --> 07:17.017
Okay.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.263
Wow. No good night kiss?

07:21.024 --> 07:22.231
That's up to your brother.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.232
That won't be necessary.

07:26.780 --> 07:27.691
Fine.

07:33.828 --> 07:36.115
Had enough?
You gonna back down?

07:36.331 --> 07:37.162
No.

07:37.374 --> 07:38.865
He's real smart,
but he needs to learn

07:39.084 --> 07:40.450
he doesn't know everything.

07:41.711 --> 07:44.829
Woman, you are getting sexier
by the second. Whew.

07:45.715 --> 07:47.502
Hey, now that you're
treating him like an adult,

07:47.717 --> 07:48.958
can I have
his allowance?

07:49.344 --> 07:52.087
That allowance is for chores,
which you already don't do.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.672
Come on. We all know
I'm your favorite.

07:55.850 --> 07:58.058
You're not even
his third favorite.

08:01.106 --> 08:03.223
<i>Making my school lunch the next morning</i>

08:03.441 --> 08:06.605
<i>proved no easier than dinner.</i>

08:07.320 --> 08:09.061
Maybe you're turning it
the wrong way.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.021
Don't you have
anything better to do?

08:11.282 --> 08:12.898
Not better than this.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.072
This is nothing
a little science can't fix.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.199
All I need to do
is break the pressure seal.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.244
I don't think
that was enough science.

08:26.506 --> 08:27.371
Morning, Missy.

08:27.590 --> 08:29.331
- Morning, Sheldon.
- Morning.

08:29.551 --> 08:31.008
Morning, Mary.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.212
Mom, you need to sign
this consent form.

08:35.432 --> 08:36.172
What's it for?

08:36.599 --> 08:37.385
Field trip.

08:37.600 --> 08:38.932
- Where?
- Museum.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.889
- Which one?
- Does it matter?

08:41.104 --> 08:43.061
It's not like I'm gonna
learn anything, anyway.

08:44.482 --> 08:47.065
It's the planetarium
at the science museum.

08:47.277 --> 08:48.768
And I need you
to sign mine, too.

08:48.987 --> 08:51.024
Oh. It's interesting
that an adult

08:51.239 --> 08:53.481
would need his mother
to sign a consent form.

08:53.700 --> 08:54.656
And here we go.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.326
I don't need you to sign it,
the school does.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.153
So you're saying
even the school doesn't think

08:59.372 --> 09:02.160
that you're mature enough
to make all your own decisions.

09:04.461 --> 09:05.451
<i>In that moment,</i>

09:05.670 --> 09:09.914
<i>I was so angry with her,
I almost opened the jar.</i>

09:14.888 --> 09:16.754
I'm ready to go to college.

09:18.349 --> 09:21.137
Okay. Where you thinking?

09:21.352 --> 09:24.095
Somewhere with a good science
program, but far enough away

09:24.314 --> 09:27.432
to make my mom cry herself to
sleep every night that I'm gone.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.600
You're applying to
college out of spite?

09:30.028 --> 09:31.894
I see why you're
the guidance counselor.

09:32.363 --> 09:34.025
Okay, let's see.

09:34.949 --> 09:37.066
What about Caltech in Pasadena?

09:37.285 --> 09:39.277
I can't see myself
living in California.

09:39.496 --> 09:41.453
I don't trust
their carefree lifestyle.

09:41.664 --> 09:43.405
<i>Okay. Um...</i>

09:43.625 --> 09:45.833
How about MIT in Boston?

09:46.044 --> 09:47.956
Do they have
a strong physics program?

09:48.254 --> 09:49.461
They're more of
an engineering school.

09:49.672 --> 09:50.412
Next.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.051
There's always Harvard.

09:58.223 --> 10:02.342
Hmm. I don't like cold weather,
but I do look good in maroon.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.763
All right, Harvard it is.
Thank you for your help.

10:06.981 --> 10:08.768
Are you interested in
applying to a safety school

10:08.983 --> 10:10.269
in case you don't get in?

10:10.902 --> 10:13.064
Safety school. You're funny.

10:15.073 --> 10:16.609
So, how was everyone's day?

10:16.825 --> 10:18.532
I cut open a
frog at school.

10:18.743 --> 10:19.859
For science class?

10:20.662 --> 10:21.869
Sure.

10:22.997 --> 10:24.329
We should put a lock
on the knife drawer.

10:28.086 --> 10:28.917
What are you eating?

10:29.129 --> 10:31.542
An English muffin with
ketchup and spray cheese.

10:31.756 --> 10:32.371
No fair.

10:32.590 --> 10:33.455
Lucky.

10:33.758 --> 10:36.171
Sorry I spent an hour
making meatloaf.

10:36.511 --> 10:37.376
<i>So, Moonpie,</i>

10:37.595 --> 10:39.302
how's adult life treating you?

10:39.514 --> 10:40.504
Very well, actually.

10:40.723 --> 10:42.430
I'm working on my application
to Harvard.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.307
Is that so?

10:44.519 --> 10:46.431
Yes. And I'm planning
on transferring there

10:46.646 --> 10:47.932
as soon as possible.

10:48.314 --> 10:49.930
You're not going away
to Harvard.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.812
I don't believe
you have a say in this.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.277
Okay, well,

10:55.530 --> 10:56.691
Harvard's real expensive.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.401
How do you plan
on paying for it?

10:58.616 --> 11:00.278
Oh, I'm sure
I'll get a scholarship.

11:00.577 --> 11:02.534
- Oh, are you?
- Yes, I am.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.452
Okay. Okay.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.372
Let's just take a deep breath
and talk about something else.

11:08.084 --> 11:08.699
Fine.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.620
I want to hear about that frog.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.171
A different something else.

11:14.632 --> 11:15.622
<i>I just
realized something.</i>

11:15.842 --> 11:18.505
College applications cost money
just to send in.

11:18.887 --> 11:21.550
- They do?
- $50, $60 a pop.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.926
I don't believe you have
that kind of money, do you?

11:27.061 --> 11:27.767
Will you excuse me?

11:27.979 --> 11:30.687
I have to go take
a cold shower.

11:39.908 --> 11:43.197
Hello, Randall.
I would like to apply for a job.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.194
- You would?
- Yes.

11:45.413 --> 11:47.746
I need to earn money
so I can apply to Harvard.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.540
I thought about
going to Harvard,

11:49.751 --> 11:52.289
but then I realized
The Shack is my passion.

11:53.296 --> 11:54.207
So can I work here?

11:54.714 --> 11:57.081
Excuse me. How much RAM
does this computer have?

11:57.300 --> 11:59.337
Um, I can check
on that for you.

11:59.552 --> 12:04.297
It comes with 640 kilobytes,
but it's expandable up to 768.

12:06.017 --> 12:06.723
Well?

12:07.644 --> 12:08.976
Do you even
have a rÃ©sumÃ©?

12:09.270 --> 12:12.809
No, but I have a report card
that'll knock your socks off.

12:13.024 --> 12:14.356
And what's the processor speed?

12:14.567 --> 12:17.981
It has the Intel 8286,
so ten megahertz.

12:21.032 --> 12:22.148
Sorry, Sheldon.

12:22.367 --> 12:24.905
I think it's against company
policy to hire little kids.

12:25.119 --> 12:27.736
But people say I'm like
an old man all the time.

12:27.956 --> 12:31.415
Hey, I'm one of 'em,
but the answer's still no.

12:31.834 --> 12:32.790
<i>When people wonder</i>

12:33.002 --> 12:35.619
<i>why Radio Shack eventually
went out of business,</i>

12:36.172 --> 12:37.629
<i>you can point to this moment.</i>

12:40.218 --> 12:41.254
Meemaw?

12:42.345 --> 12:43.426
Meemaw?

12:45.181 --> 12:48.140
Hey! Looking sharp.

12:48.351 --> 12:51.310
You're not gonna try to sell
me a set of knives, are you?

12:51.854 --> 12:54.062
- No.
- It's a joke.

12:55.525 --> 12:56.811
'Cause of the suit.

12:57.902 --> 12:58.642
Okay.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.354
I need money
for my Harvard application,

13:01.572 --> 13:04.110
and was wondering if there are
any jobs I could do.

13:04.325 --> 13:07.033
Hmm. My yard could
use a little weeding.

13:07.328 --> 13:09.445
I'm not terribly fond
of outdoor work.

13:09.914 --> 13:12.657
Plus, that garden gnome
terrifies me.

13:12.959 --> 13:15.201
Ernesto has that
effect on people.

13:15.420 --> 13:16.911
How much does the job pay?

13:17.130 --> 13:18.746
Well, let me think.
How about a dollar an hour?

13:18.965 --> 13:21.457
- How about five dollars an hour?
- How about 50 cents an hour?

13:21.676 --> 13:22.883
Wait a minute.
What just happened?

13:23.094 --> 13:26.303
- I'll tell you what. I'll give you a dollar.
- Thank you.

13:31.477 --> 13:33.013
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:33.396 --> 13:35.854
You know how you think I
can't do anything for myself?

13:37.275 --> 13:38.482
I do think that, yes.

13:38.693 --> 13:40.685
Well, I have something
I'd like to show you.

13:41.404 --> 13:44.442
- You did some chores?
- Come see for yourself.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.486
I don't know if I'm ready
for another heart attack,

13:47.702 --> 13:49.409
but here we go.

13:52.373 --> 13:53.864
Feast your eyes.

14:00.465 --> 14:01.501
You did all this?

14:01.924 --> 14:02.960
I did.

14:04.552 --> 14:06.134
You shoved everything in
the closet, didn't you?

14:06.346 --> 14:07.382
Take a look.

14:19.567 --> 14:20.523
I am impressed.

14:20.735 --> 14:21.942
You should be.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.731
There may be hope for you yet.

14:33.247 --> 14:35.159
I thought that showed ingenuity.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.709
Okay, here you go.

14:38.920 --> 14:43.335
I got you a shovel
and a bucket and some gloves.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.170
Did you check the gloves
for spiders?

14:47.011 --> 14:49.253
Is this my first
day as Meemaw?

14:51.265 --> 14:52.176
<i>It's not?</i>

14:52.642 --> 14:54.804
<i>No. It's duck-hunting season.</i>

14:55.019 --> 14:58.558
<i>That, sir,
is an in-mitigated fabrication!</i>

14:58.773 --> 15:01.186
<i>- It's wabbit season!
- Duck season.</i>

15:02.402 --> 15:05.110
Not again.
What's wrong, baby?

15:05.321 --> 15:07.608
I'm trying to hear about
duck season and wabbit season,

15:07.824 --> 15:10.282
but they keep talking about
this stupid tornado.

15:10.493 --> 15:13.327
<i>The National Weather
Service has issued a tornado watch</i>

15:13.538 --> 15:16.997
<i>Angelina...</i>

15:21.671 --> 15:23.788
Hey, Shelly, how's
it going over there?

15:24.006 --> 15:25.963
I hate everything about this.

15:27.427 --> 15:28.793
You need to come home
with me.

15:29.011 --> 15:30.297
No. I'm working.

15:30.805 --> 15:32.797
There is a tornado watch.
Let's go!

15:33.015 --> 15:35.098
Oh, come on, Mary.
We've had a watch

15:35.309 --> 15:37.801
every day for two months;
nothing ever happens.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.015
I think
you're just worried

15:39.230 --> 15:40.095
I'm earning the money

15:40.314 --> 15:41.976
to send in
my college application.

15:42.191 --> 15:45.059
I am worried it is not safe
out here. Let's go!

15:45.278 --> 15:47.019
I can worry about my own safety,
thank you.

15:47.238 --> 15:48.774
I don't care
if you think you're an adult.

15:48.990 --> 15:52.154
I'm your mother, and you will do as I say.

15:52.577 --> 15:53.863
Well, that ain't good.

15:54.579 --> 15:55.444
You believe me now?

15:56.914 --> 15:57.574
Mom?

16:14.974 --> 16:17.091
- I'm scared!
- It's gonna be okay.

16:17.310 --> 16:17.925
<i>Georgie!</i>

16:18.144 --> 16:20.306
- Help me get this in front of the window.<i>
- On it.</i>

16:23.483 --> 16:25.224
- Is this my bed?
- Yeah.

16:25.443 --> 16:26.854
Aw, it took me an
hour to make it.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.029
You okay, Moonpie?

16:31.782 --> 16:32.943
I'm all right.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.492
- I'm not. This is scary.
- We're gonna be fine.

16:35.703 --> 16:37.285
This'll blow through
in a few minutes.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.621
I need to pee.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.077
Can you hold it, baby?

16:46.380 --> 16:47.666
We'll find out.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.342
I'm not all right anymore!

16:53.554 --> 16:54.795
<i>Flashlights, guys!</i>

16:56.140 --> 16:57.506
What if it hits us
and we all die?

16:57.725 --> 17:00.684
It's not gonna hit us!
<i>I</i> might hit you.

17:02.188 --> 17:04.180
But first,
I'm gonna hold you.

17:07.276 --> 17:09.893
In the name of Jesus,
I place a hedge of protection

17:10.112 --> 17:12.194
around this house and my family.

17:12.406 --> 17:15.273
I command this storm
to skip over our home

17:15.492 --> 17:16.733
<i>in Jesus' name.</i>

17:16.993 --> 17:17.780
<i>I wish peace</i>

17:17.994 --> 17:20.112
to every single person
in this room

17:20.414 --> 17:22.497
and declare that not one of us
will get hurt

17:22.708 --> 17:25.290
in this storm, in Jesus' name!

17:27.505 --> 17:28.586
Pray harder!

17:28.798 --> 17:29.709
Okay.

17:40.851 --> 17:44.390
<i>The good news was
most of our neighborhood was spared.</i>

17:44.772 --> 17:45.512
<i>Oh.</i>

17:45.731 --> 17:47.688
<i>My mother thought</i>

17:47.900 --> 17:49.436
<i>she had something
to do with it.</i>

17:50.403 --> 17:51.393
Looks like your house is okay.

17:51.612 --> 17:54.320
You were just worried I might
have to come live with you.

17:54.532 --> 17:56.945
Oh, I think the word you're
looking for is "terrified."

17:57.618 --> 17:59.484
Hmm. Better go check on it.

17:59.704 --> 18:00.865
I'll come with you.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.412
Be careful.

18:06.168 --> 18:06.783
Mom?

18:07.128 --> 18:08.164
Yeah, baby?

18:20.016 --> 18:22.508
You would not believe
the pee I just took.
