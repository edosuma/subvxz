02:36.197 --> 02:39.951
Brad darling.

02:40.368 --> 02:44.622
I love you.
- I know.

02:45.039 --> 02:47.500
I just had to call you.

02:47.917 --> 02:50.378
I'll never forget last night.

02:50.795 --> 02:53.548
Especially your new song.

02:53.965 --> 02:57.718
Our song, Eileen.
I wrote it for you.

02:58.135 --> 03:01.055
Oh, Brad.

03:01.472 --> 03:03.850
Would you sing it to me again?

03:04.267 --> 03:06.727
Oh now?
- Please.

03:07.144 --> 03:08.813
Alright.

03:12.608 --> 03:17.446
"You are my inspiration, Eileen.

03:19.282 --> 03:23.744
A perfect combination, Eileen.

03:26.038 --> 03:30.877
Your eyes,
your hair are beyond compare.

03:31.294 --> 03:36.632
So is it any wonder?
You captured me,

03:37.049 --> 03:43.306
and now
I'm under your spell? Eileen ...

03:43.723 --> 03:46.642
I hate to interrupt,
but would you mind hanging up?

03:47.059 --> 03:51.647
Who's that? - The other half
of my party line. She'll go away.

03:52.064 --> 03:55.359
You've been talking for 30 minutes.
My call is urgent.

03:55.776 --> 04:00.740
This is an urgent call, too.
- Singing to a girl at 9 a.m.?

04:01.157 --> 04:04.619
It's not your business
what he does to me. Or when.

04:05.036 --> 04:08.289
Would you get off this line!

04:46.285 --> 04:50.623
I know it's early, cher.
But I just had to talk to you.

04:51.040 --> 04:55.378
Will I see you tonight?
- I'm sorry, Yvette. I have to work.

04:56.754 --> 04:59.423
I have 6 songs to write
for the new show.

04:59.841 --> 05:05.471
You'll have to eat dinner, no?
- I'll throw something together here.

05:05.888 --> 05:10.476
No, darling, you mustn't.
You must keep up your strength.

05:10.893 --> 05:13.646
I'll come over and cook for you, yes?

05:14.063 --> 05:16.899
Well, if you like.

05:17.316 --> 05:20.528
Thank you, darling.
- It's nothing.

05:21.571 --> 05:22.613
Brad?

05:24.574 --> 05:27.827
Sing me a litte of our song.
- Oh Yvette.

05:28.244 --> 05:29.954
Please.

05:35.084 --> 05:41.090
"Tu es une inspiration, Yvette.

05:43.926 --> 05:49.265
Une parfaite combination, Yvette."

05:50.349 --> 05:52.894
Would you get off this phone!

05:53.311 --> 05:56.814
Who is that woman?
- An eavesdropper on my party line.

05:57.231 --> 06:01.444
She always listens in.
lt brightens up her drab, empty life.

06:01.861 --> 06:05.573
If I could call once in awhile,
my life wouldn't be so drab.

06:24.550 --> 06:27.553
Must you zoom up so fast?

06:27.970 --> 06:31.307
Are you jet-propelled or something?
- Good morning, Alma.

06:31.724 --> 06:35.311
The laundryman's coming by.
Would you clean the cupboards for me?

06:35.728 --> 06:40.900
Call the office and tell them I'll be
a little late? - What a hangover.

06:41.317 --> 06:44.987
I'm afraid so.
- Why does she get stoned every night?

06:45.404 --> 06:49.617
I don't know, Harry.
Maybe she's got a party line.

07:24.694 --> 07:28.322
Your phone company wants
everyone to have a private phone.

07:28.739 --> 07:32.994
We're putting in trunk lines
as fast as we can. But it takes time.

07:33.411 --> 07:36.998
We have hundreds of applications,
which have priority.

07:37.415 --> 07:39.375
There must be some way.

07:39.792 --> 07:43.421
Well, if an emergency arose.
If you were pregnant,

07:43.838 --> 07:46.132
you'd jump to the top of our list.

07:46.549 --> 07:50.219
Being single,
I'm not quite ready for that.

07:50.636 --> 07:54.724
I don't know what to suggest.
- I'm at wit's end.

07:55.141 --> 07:57.894
I'm an interior decorator
and I often work at home.

07:58.311 --> 08:03.774
I must make business calls.
But that man is always on the phone.

08:04.192 --> 08:08.362
Oo you know what it's like
to share a line with a sex maniac?

08:15.369 --> 08:18.539
That's a very serious charge, Madame.

08:19.582 --> 08:23.586
Can you substantiate it?
- He sings love songs at 9 a.m.

08:24.003 --> 08:26.422
Ooes he use objectionable language?

08:26.839 --> 08:30.384
No.
- Or threats of any nature? - No.

08:30.801 --> 08:32.385
Any immoral overtures?

08:33.638 --> 08:37.850
Not to me.
- Ooes this bother you? - Yes.

08:38.267 --> 08:40.727
No. What do you mean, bothered?

08:41.145 --> 08:43.438
His conduct with all these women.

08:43.856 --> 08:49.445
I don't care what he does,
he should stop doing it on my phone.

08:50.488 --> 08:53.115
We'll send an inspector over.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.953
Thank you. I'd appreciate that.

08:57.370 --> 09:02.708
If what you say is true, we may have
to disconnect him. - Good.

09:06.879 --> 09:09.632
Haven't you reached Jan yet?

09:11.384 --> 09:17.431
Keep trying. If she's not here soon,
that woman is going to drive me crazy.

09:17.849 --> 09:21.602
Ming dynasty in a rumpus room.

09:27.149 --> 09:29.151
Mrs. Walters, be careful.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.488
This is priceless.
- Really? What is it?

09:32.905 --> 09:38.411
A 14th century crematory urn.
- A crematory urn?

09:38.828 --> 09:41.581
Is anybody in it?
- Not at the moment.

09:41.998 --> 09:45.334
Good. Then we can drill a hole in it.

09:45.751 --> 09:48.296
A hole?
- So we can wire it for a lamp.

09:48.713 --> 09:53.384
Mrs. Walters, we do not wire
14th century crematory urns.

09:53.801 --> 09:55.803
I suppose not.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.810
Jan.

10:05.688 --> 10:06.731
Hello, Jonathon.

10:07.773 --> 10:10.193
Hi. I got something to tell you.

10:11.110 --> 10:13.779
I tried to call. But your line's busy.
- Naturally.

10:14.197 --> 10:16.741
Just picked it up. How do you like it?

10:17.158 --> 10:21.621
Marvellous. - Like the color?
- Just beautiful. - The upholstery?

10:22.038 --> 10:24.165
It's yours.

10:24.582 --> 10:28.294
In grateful appreciation
of your brilliant job in my office.

10:31.005 --> 10:36.302
What? Jonathon,
you can't go around giving girls cars.

10:36.719 --> 10:40.890
I do. - This your car, Mac?
- No, it's hers.

10:41.307 --> 10:44.101
Is this your car, Miss?
- No, it's his.

10:44.519 --> 10:49.023
Jonathon, you're sweet and generous,
but I cannot accept a gift like this.

10:49.440 --> 10:53.569
Why not?
- It's too, it's too personal.

10:54.028 --> 10:55.238
This?
- Yes.

10:55.655 --> 11:00.201
If I gave you perfume or lingerie,
that would be personal.

11:00.618 --> 11:02.161
But a car?

11:02.578 --> 11:07.750
Come on. If it's yours, move it.
- Here. Send me the perfume.

11:08.167 --> 11:12.213
Are you coming to my office tomorrow?
- In the afternoon. - Listen.

11:12.630 --> 11:17.051
Are you sure
you don't want the car? - Yes.

11:17.468 --> 11:18.803
See you tomorrow.

11:24.350 --> 11:28.020
My analyst will never believe this.
- Neither will mine.

11:28.437 --> 11:32.024
Good morning.
I'm sorry to be so late.

11:32.441 --> 11:36.612
That's alright. Mr. Peirot and l
have had a fruitful morning.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.823
Very fruitful.
- Good.

11:39.240 --> 11:44.036
What are you doing with that?
- I picked it out myself.

11:44.453 --> 11:48.708
A fertility goddess is the last thing
you need in Scarsdale.

11:49.125 --> 11:52.253
A fertility goddess?
Oh dear, I had no idea.

11:52.670 --> 11:56.132
Oon't forget,
I'm expecting you at the housewarming.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.509
We'll be there.

12:00.678 --> 12:03.347
Savage little thing, isn't it?

12:08.603 --> 12:12.356
That woman has
the taste of a water buffalo.

12:12.773 --> 12:17.904
Why do business with her?
- She's a very rich water buffalo.

12:18.321 --> 12:20.781
If you ever leave me
alone with her again ...

12:21.199 --> 12:26.370
Where were you? I tried all morning.
- Lover boy got started early today.

12:26.787 --> 12:30.625
There must be some way
to get a private line.

12:31.042 --> 12:35.796
Then say it's an emergency.
- Thank you, Mr. P.

12:36.214 --> 12:40.092
I reported him to the phone company.
- It's about time.

12:40.510 --> 12:42.595
They're sending someone over.

12:43.012 --> 12:48.392
As for me, whatever he gets,
he deserved it. - Good.

12:57.902 --> 13:00.238
I'm from the telephone company.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.323
Well, hello.

13:04.534 --> 13:07.745
I ...
- Yes? - I'm ...

13:08.162 --> 13:10.832
I'm Miss Oickenson. I'm an inspector.

13:12.124 --> 13:14.293
What would you like to inspect?
- You.

13:14.710 --> 13:17.755
I mean
we received a complaint about you.

13:18.548 --> 13:22.385
Well, I've never had
any complaints before.

13:23.761 --> 13:27.181
Won't you come in?
- Thank you.

13:51.789 --> 13:56.627
You don't have to break
the sound barrier, you hot-rodder.

14:00.923 --> 14:02.175
Alma?

14:03.217 --> 14:05.386
Well, I heard from the phone company.

14:05.803 --> 14:08.764
I can't get a call through,
and they send me this.

14:09.182 --> 14:13.144
"Your complaint
is entirely unwarranted.

14:13.561 --> 14:16.314
According to our inspector,
Miss Oickenson."

14:16.731 --> 14:18.774
They sent a woman.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.944
It's like sending a marshmallow
to put out a bonfire.

14:22.361 --> 14:23.529
Read it yourself.

14:23.946 --> 14:28.159
You know
I never get into focus until 10 a.m.

14:28.576 --> 14:32.121
"Our inspector found
Mr. Allen to be very cooperative."

14:32.538 --> 14:35.208
I'll bet he was.

14:40.379 --> 14:44.926
Hello?
- Miss Morrow? My name is Brad Allen.

14:45.343 --> 14:49.388
Yes? - The phone company
gave me a code number for our line.

14:49.805 --> 14:51.349
It's 793.

14:51.766 --> 14:57.438
If you have any future complaints,
I suggest you call me personally.

14:57.855 --> 14:59.774
If I hadn't complained,

15:00.191 --> 15:05.613
the inspector wouldn't have found out
how friendly you are. - Miss Morrow,

15:06.030 --> 15:08.199
why do
my personal affairs interest you?

15:08.616 --> 15:11.953
It's not interest,
Mr. Allen. It's revolt.

15:12.370 --> 15:15.331
I don't go around
complaining about your affairs.

15:15.748 --> 15:19.001
I have none to complain about.
- lt figures.

15:19.418 --> 15:24.090
What do you mean? - It's obvious
you live alone and don't like it.

15:24.507 --> 15:26.217
I like living alone.

15:26.634 --> 15:30.805
Oon't take your bedroom problems
out on me.

15:31.222 --> 15:35.351
I have no bedroom problems.
There's nothing there that bothers me.

15:35.768 --> 15:36.936
Too bad.

15:37.353 --> 15:42.316
Let's try to be adult about this,
work out some schedule

15:42.733 --> 15:46.404
where I can make my business calls
and you can make your ...

15:46.821 --> 15:49.240
whatever you call them.

15:49.657 --> 15:55.079
From the hour to the half-hour,
the phone is yours. Afterwards mine.

15:55.496 --> 15:58.040
If someone gets
a call during the other's time,

15:58.457 --> 16:02.753
he or she will terminate
the call as quickly as possible.

16:03.171 --> 16:06.215
In emergencies,
each must be a little tolerant.

16:06.632 --> 16:11.304
How does it sound?
- Like a UN report.

16:11.721 --> 16:14.682
You disagree?
- No, it might work.

16:15.099 --> 16:19.312
I hope so. We have to share
this line for at least another month.

16:19.729 --> 16:22.440
We have to try
living with one another.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.735
Well?

16:26.777 --> 16:29.572
I was waiting
for an off-color remark from you.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.992
Is that all you have on your mind?

16:33.409 --> 16:37.872
Never mind my mind.
You keep to your half-hour, I to mine.

16:44.337 --> 16:47.298
He makes pretty good sense.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.675
Were you listening in again?
- Yes.

16:50.092 --> 16:54.805
Have you no shame?
- No, he's improved many a day for me.

16:55.223 --> 16:59.685
What made such good sense?
- Worse than a woman living alone

17:00.102 --> 17:03.689
is one saying she likes it.
- I do like it.

17:04.106 --> 17:08.944
I have a good job, a lovely apartment,
I go out with nice men,

17:09.362 --> 17:12.656
to the theater, the best restaurants.
What am I missing?

17:13.074 --> 17:16.493
When you have to ask, believe me,
you're missing it.

17:16.911 --> 17:21.290
What's a girl to do? Ask the first man
she meets to come home with her?

17:21.707 --> 17:24.085
No, not that.

17:24.502 --> 17:25.920
lt don't work.

17:27.755 --> 17:29.715
Bedroom problems.

17:34.637 --> 17:36.639
Bedroom problems?

17:39.934 --> 17:41.561
Bedroom problems.

17:43.688 --> 17:45.523
Over here, please.

17:47.650 --> 17:49.235
Just set it down here.

17:49.652 --> 17:51.404
No, the other way.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.826
Thank you.

17:57.869 --> 17:59.412
How's it look?

18:00.997 --> 18:03.749
You look beautiful.
- Jonathon, now really,

18:04.167 --> 18:06.669
do you like it or ...
- Whatever you like, I like.

18:07.086 --> 18:11.549
Jan, why won't you marry me?
- Jonathon, I don't love you.

18:11.966 --> 18:13.759
That's absurd.

18:14.385 --> 18:18.139
I'm young, rich, and healthy.
And I'm very good-looking.

18:18.556 --> 18:21.017
I've got everything.
- lncluding 3 ex-wives.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.935
Oh, that's what it is.

18:23.352 --> 18:27.273
Oon't hold it against me. I was just
revolting against my mother with them.

18:27.690 --> 18:30.359
I'm trying to work it out
why I dislike her so.

18:30.776 --> 18:34.906
I've been in therapy for 2 years now.
- And? - It's perfectly healthy.

18:35.323 --> 18:38.159
He dislikes her as much as I do,
and he's from Vienna.

18:38.576 --> 18:40.953
We'll go to Mexico.

18:41.370 --> 18:44.373
I've never been married in Mexico.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.877
I just don't love you.
- How do you know?

18:48.294 --> 18:52.423
Love isn't an opinion,
it's a chemical reaction.

18:52.840 --> 18:55.134
We've never even kissed.

19:04.894 --> 19:07.563
They didn't hit
the moon with the first shot either.

19:09.232 --> 19:11.150
Oh Jonathon.

19:11.567 --> 19:15.196
I guess that's what I want.
To hit the moon.

19:17.281 --> 19:18.658
Well ...
- I'll tell you what,

19:19.075 --> 19:21.577
let's have dinner
and we can try another countdown.

19:21.994 --> 19:25.873
Can't do it. I have a
housewarming for one of our clients.

19:26.290 --> 19:30.670
I'll call you tomorrow.
If I can ever get through.

19:31.087 --> 19:33.840
Call between the half-hour and hour.
- Why?

19:34.257 --> 19:38.928
I arranged a cease-fire.
- Marry me. You'll get tons of lines!

19:39.345 --> 19:41.347
I'd better leave.

19:41.764 --> 19:44.350
That could sweep a girl off her feet.

19:50.398 --> 19:51.941
Hi, Alma.

19:53.568 --> 19:55.528
Any calls?

19:55.945 --> 19:58.322
Shhh. It's him.

20:10.042 --> 20:13.546
Mr. Allen, you're on my half-hour.

20:14.589 --> 20:16.674
Party pooper.

20:25.141 --> 20:28.519
Hello?
- Never do that again.

20:28.936 --> 20:32.106
We had an agreement.
You were on my time.

20:32.523 --> 20:36.527
So I overlapped by a few minutes.
What can I do when someone calls me?

20:36.944 --> 20:39.322
Be as rude as you?

20:39.739 --> 20:43.743
Oo you have anything else to say?
- Yes. Get off my back.

20:44.160 --> 20:47.121
Stop living vicariously
in what you think I do.

20:47.538 --> 20:52.335
The bakery has lots of warm rolls.
Oon't press your nose to the window.

20:57.006 --> 21:00.051
Come in, Jonathon. It's open.
- Hi, Brad.

21:00.468 --> 21:03.346
Got any more songs ready.
- Almost.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.598
Fine. Let's hear them.

21:06.015 --> 21:07.808
Not now. I'm in a hurry.

21:08.226 --> 21:11.854
I'm putting up
200,000 dollars for this show.

21:12.271 --> 21:17.568
We've got a theater deadline.
- You're hobbing me. - Oh, am l?

21:18.611 --> 21:22.698
I don't know. Money seems to have lost
its value these days.

21:23.115 --> 21:27.370
With 200,000 dollars, my grandfather
cornered the wheat market.

21:27.787 --> 21:31.707
Today, you can't scare songwriters
with it. - That's inflation for you.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.584
Pour yourself a scotch.

21:34.460 --> 21:35.670
Thanks.

21:36.087 --> 21:39.715
You're prejudiced against me
because I'm part of a minority group.

21:40.758 --> 21:42.218
What minority group?

21:43.135 --> 21:46.222
Millionaires. You outnumber us,
but you'll never get us.

21:46.639 --> 21:50.518
We'll fight for our rights.
And we've got the money to do it.

21:50.935 --> 21:53.396
You sound absolutely bitter.

21:53.813 --> 21:56.357
You don't know
what this show means to me.

21:56.774 --> 21:59.777
We went through college together.
You worked your way through.

22:00.194 --> 22:03.656
You're an important songwriter now.
You've had some Broadway hits.

22:04.073 --> 22:07.410
You started out with nothing
and you've made it far.

22:07.827 --> 22:12.290
I started out with 8 million dollars,
and I've still got 8 million dollars.

22:12.707 --> 22:15.084
I just can't seem to get ahead.

22:15.960 --> 22:19.630
Who's the girl?
- What girl?

22:20.047 --> 22:22.091
Come on, you can't kid me.

22:22.508 --> 22:26.095
I've been through 3 marriages
with you. You're like a fighter.

22:26.512 --> 22:28.681
Only ambitious on the way to the ring.

22:29.098 --> 22:32.101
Well, there's a girl.

22:33.936 --> 22:37.690
Brad,
she's the sweetest, the loveliest,

22:38.107 --> 22:41.402
the most talented person I've met.
- Like the stripper.

22:41.819 --> 22:44.280
She was an exotic dancer.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.449
With trained doves.

22:46.866 --> 22:50.328
When's the happy occasion?

22:50.745 --> 22:53.372
Well, I don't know for sure.

22:53.789 --> 22:56.250
She claims to not want to marry me.

22:56.667 --> 22:59.545
Note, that's
what all my wives said at first.

22:59.962 --> 23:04.926
Mind if I call her up?
- Go ahead. What's her name? - Jan.

23:09.597 --> 23:10.681
Jan? Who?

23:11.098 --> 23:12.517
Jan ...

23:14.519 --> 23:18.981
I'm not going to tell you.
I may be neurotic, but I'm not crazy.

23:21.776 --> 23:23.277
Busy. I can never get her.

23:24.153 --> 23:26.197
She shares it with some nut.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.451
lt couldn't be.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.915
Or could it?

23:38.709 --> 23:39.794
A nut?

23:40.211 --> 23:43.089
Some guy with a phone fetish.

23:43.506 --> 23:47.802
She had to make a deal with him to use
the phone on alternate half-hours.

23:48.219 --> 23:49.887
That's ridiculous.

23:55.726 --> 23:57.478
A pretty girl?
- Yeah.

23:59.313 --> 24:01.732
Good figure?

24:02.775 --> 24:06.946
And you won't tell me who she is?
- That's right.

24:07.363 --> 24:11.617
I found this goldmine. I'm not telling
an old claim-jumper who she is.

24:12.034 --> 24:14.829
You sly dog.

24:17.290 --> 24:21.335
Still busy.
Must be the wrong half-hour.

24:23.004 --> 24:24.046
Brad ...

24:24.839 --> 24:27.508
As a friend ... sit down, boy.

24:27.925 --> 24:32.346
As a friend, I only hope one day
you find a girl like this.

24:32.763 --> 24:36.684
You should quit chasing around,
get married. - Why? - Why?

24:37.101 --> 24:41.022
You're not getting any younger, fella.
Sure, it's fun, it's exciting.

24:41.439 --> 24:44.275
Oancing with a different doll
every night.

24:44.692 --> 24:48.070
But a man has to give it up sometime.
- Why?

24:48.487 --> 24:53.409
Because he wants to create a stable,
lasting relationship with one person.

24:53.826 --> 24:58.289
Brad, believe me,
there's nothing so wonderful,

24:58.706 --> 25:03.085
so fulfilling, as coming home
to the same woman every night.

25:04.170 --> 25:05.922
Why?
- Because,

25:06.339 --> 25:08.090
that's what an adult does.

25:08.508 --> 25:13.221
A wife, a family, a house.
A mature man wants responsibilities.

25:14.931 --> 25:19.393
Why? - If you want to,
you can find arguments for anything.

25:19.810 --> 25:21.938
I've got to get going.

25:22.647 --> 25:25.691
What do you have against marriage?

25:26.108 --> 25:27.735
Jonathon,

25:28.778 --> 25:31.364
before a man marries, he's ...

25:31.781 --> 25:33.866
like a tree in the forest.

25:34.283 --> 25:38.704
He stands there independent.
An entity unto himself.

25:39.121 --> 25:44.669
Then he's chopped down, loses his
branches and bark. Lands in the river.

25:45.837 --> 25:47.964
Then he's taken to the mill.

25:48.381 --> 25:52.176
When he comes out,
he's no longer a tree.

25:52.593 --> 25:56.764
He's the vanity table,
the breakfast nook, the baby crib,

25:57.181 --> 25:59.767
and the newspaper
that lines the garbage can.

26:01.143 --> 26:05.857
No, no. If this girl weren't something
special, then I'd agree with you.

26:06.274 --> 26:10.069
But with Jan, you look forward
to losing your branches.

26:13.114 --> 26:14.240
I've got to go.

26:17.952 --> 26:22.874
Remember I need those songs.
- In your office on Monday. - Fine.

26:29.463 --> 26:34.427
Hello?
- Miss Morrow. This is Brad Allen.

26:34.844 --> 26:38.472
I've just gone through an agonizing
reappraisal of our situation.

26:38.890 --> 26:41.767
And I'm not very proud of myself.

26:42.185 --> 26:46.564
I've used the phone too much
and been extremely rude.

26:46.981 --> 26:51.402
I'd like to apologize
and suggest we could get together.

26:51.819 --> 26:53.821
For a cup of coffee, maybe.

26:54.238 --> 26:58.326
We could get acquainted and
we might find we have a lot in common.

26:58.743 --> 27:01.913
Mr. Allen,
we have nothing in common.

27:02.330 --> 27:06.375
Not that meeting you
mightn't prove amusing.

27:06.792 --> 27:09.962
But some jokes are
just too obvious to be funny.

27:19.180 --> 27:20.515
Bradley, honey.

27:21.891 --> 27:24.977
I've almost got it. There.

27:25.394 --> 27:29.232
I can't believe it.
A song for little old me.

27:41.410 --> 27:47.208
"You are my inspiration, Marie.

27:49.961 --> 27:55.049
A perfect combination, Marie.

27:56.926 --> 28:00.596
Your eyes,
your hair, are beyond compare.

28:01.013 --> 28:04.642
So is it any wonder?

28:05.059 --> 28:11.899
You captured me
and now I'm under your spell? Marie."

28:12.942 --> 28:14.652
Oh Brad.

28:15.236 --> 28:20.241
What a pity you have to leave so soon.
- I have an early appointment.

28:20.658 --> 28:25.663
Everyone thinks the house is heaven.
- Oh, I'm so glad.

28:27.415 --> 28:30.042
Good evening, Mother.
How's the party going? - Lovely.

28:30.459 --> 28:34.005
This is my son Tony.
- Hello, Tony. - Hello.

28:34.422 --> 28:38.259
Tony's graduating from Harvard.
He's Phi Beta Kappa, you know.

28:38.676 --> 28:42.471
It's not a big deal.
- He's just too modest.

28:42.889 --> 28:46.100
You needn't wait for a cab, Jan.
Tony can take you back.

28:46.517 --> 28:50.646
I wouldn't want to impose.
- I'd be delighted to.

28:51.689 --> 28:53.232
Thank you.

28:53.649 --> 28:57.653
I do hope Mr. P. will feel better
in the morning. - I'm sure he will.

28:58.070 --> 29:01.157
lt was marvellous.
- Thank you. - I'll talk to you soon.

29:01.574 --> 29:04.494
Goodnight.
- I won't be long, Mother.

29:10.583 --> 29:13.211
Tony, don't drive too fast.

29:13.628 --> 29:15.963
I won't, Mother.

29:23.554 --> 29:26.641
When do you have to be
at the Copa for the next show?

29:27.058 --> 29:29.143
Oon't worry, darling.

29:31.812 --> 29:35.983
We've got oodles of time.

30:02.218 --> 30:04.136
Oh! Tony, please!

30:04.554 --> 30:08.015
Jan, you're so primitive.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.435
Tony, control yourself.

30:11.853 --> 30:15.231
Remember,
you're a Harvard man.

30:16.274 --> 30:19.235
Not tonight, baby.
I'm on vacation.

30:19.652 --> 30:21.028
Stop it.

30:21.445 --> 30:25.199
You're only 21.
- I dig older women.

30:28.161 --> 30:30.746
Unbelievable how many arms you have!

30:31.164 --> 30:34.125
Tony, I'll tell your mother!

30:35.168 --> 30:37.253
It's your word against mine.

30:37.670 --> 30:40.673
Look, I've never belted
a Phi Beta Kappa ... - Okay.

30:41.090 --> 30:44.093
I'll take you home.
But first we stop for a drink.

30:44.510 --> 30:45.595
No.

30:46.012 --> 30:47.430
Fine.

30:48.973 --> 30:53.561
I'm in no condition for this.
Would you please start this car?

31:31.182 --> 31:33.935
Orink up.
You're still on your first one.

31:34.352 --> 31:37.522
Your mother will be
terribly worried about you.

31:37.939 --> 31:40.441
I'll pour you into a cab, okay?

31:40.858 --> 31:45.238
You know something?
You're very uncooperative.

31:45.655 --> 31:48.032
Just finish your drink, Jan.

31:48.449 --> 31:51.410
It's nourishing.
- Stop trying to get me drunk.

31:51.828 --> 31:53.788
Orunk?

31:54.205 --> 31:58.334
I'll have you know
a Harvard man never resorts to that.

31:58.751 --> 32:02.713
Only in emergencies.
And you, Miss Morrow,

32:03.589 --> 32:05.550
are an emergency.

32:05.967 --> 32:09.595
Tony, get the check
and let's get going finally.

32:10.888 --> 32:13.724
No. I categorically refuse.

32:15.685 --> 32:18.729
You can stay till AA comes for you.

32:19.146 --> 32:21.983
I'm leaving.
- No, wait.

32:23.109 --> 32:25.736
Just one dance, I promise.
- I don't believe you.

32:26.154 --> 32:27.822
Scout's honor.

32:38.457 --> 32:41.544
So that's the other end
of your party line.

32:49.927 --> 32:53.973
How do we get on friendly terms?
- Anything wrong, darling?

32:54.390 --> 32:55.433
No.

32:55.850 --> 32:57.435
No.

33:04.150 --> 33:06.819
Shouldn't you be getting changed?

33:07.236 --> 33:11.407
There's not much to change into.
- I know.

33:11.824 --> 33:13.659
But

33:14.702 --> 33:19.499
I want you to look
especially nice tonight.

33:21.042 --> 33:22.543
I want to, too.

33:28.549 --> 33:31.469
Brad, my boy,
you haven't got a chance.

33:31.886 --> 33:35.264
The minute you say who you are,
you are buck-dead.

33:43.940 --> 33:48.152
But maybe
you don't have to tell her.

33:52.782 --> 33:56.661
Are you all right?
- I don't feel so good.

33:57.078 --> 34:01.290
Can we sit this one out?
- Of course. - Thank you.

34:02.333 --> 34:04.085
I should be getting home.

34:05.378 --> 34:06.420
Tony.

34:07.463 --> 34:10.424
Get up. Tony.

34:15.888 --> 34:17.473
Excuse me, ma'am.

34:19.851 --> 34:23.478
I reckon it got
a might too close for your partner.

34:25.523 --> 34:27.065
Oh, yes.

34:27.483 --> 34:31.612
Could you ask a few waiters to help
get him outside? - Why shucks.

34:32.029 --> 34:35.032
No need to call anybody else.

34:35.449 --> 34:38.911
Why, boy, up-si-daisies.

34:42.248 --> 34:46.168
I can't tell you how embarrassing
this is, Mr. ... - Stetson.

34:46.585 --> 34:49.839
Rex Stetson.
No call to be embarrassed.

34:50.255 --> 34:54.844
I'm afraid he's had too much to drink.
- We have a saying in Texas, ma'am:

34:55.261 --> 34:59.682
never drink anything
stronger than you are. Or older.

35:01.559 --> 35:03.102
Your coat, ma'am.

35:04.145 --> 35:05.188
Thank you.

35:05.605 --> 35:08.232
Thank you. Thank you very much.

35:08.649 --> 35:11.611
I reckon we bring your boyfriend home.
- He's not my boyfriend.

35:12.028 --> 35:16.866
His mother is a client of mine.
- A client? You a lawyer?

35:17.283 --> 35:19.452
No, I'm an interior decorator.

35:19.869 --> 35:22.246
He was taking me home
and insisted on a drink.

35:23.664 --> 35:26.709
He wasn't trying to force
his attentions upon you?

35:28.794 --> 35:33.841
Well ... - I can't stand a man
who tries to take advantage of women.

35:34.258 --> 35:37.720
We make short work
of his kind back in Texas.

35:48.689 --> 35:53.027
2268 Gardner Orive, Scarsdale, please.

35:53.444 --> 35:58.574
Orive him slow
and set him down real easy, partner.

36:00.159 --> 36:02.453
How are you getting home, ma'am?

36:02.870 --> 36:06.833
I'll take his car
and he could pick it up tomorrow.

36:07.250 --> 36:11.712
It's mighty late for a lady to be
out alone. - It's not far.

36:12.129 --> 36:16.676
I'd feel better
if you'd let me see you home.

36:17.718 --> 36:19.345
That's very nice of you.

36:19.762 --> 36:21.389
Thank you.

36:25.518 --> 36:29.772
Oh, that's it.
- This bitty thing?

36:31.691 --> 36:34.902
Back home we got jackrabbits
bigger than this.

36:53.796 --> 36:59.177
How do you get in?
- Try putting your right leg in first.

37:08.561 --> 37:10.396
Now sit down.

37:10.813 --> 37:14.901
Where?
- On the seat. - Yeah.

37:22.617 --> 37:25.369
Can't you get the other leg in?
- I hope so.

37:25.786 --> 37:27.955
I'd hate to leave without it.

37:31.626 --> 37:36.422
Can you drive?
- I think I can steer,

37:36.839 --> 37:39.425
but someone'll have to do the pedals.

37:39.842 --> 37:45.223
We should call a cab.
- I think so, too. - Alright.

37:53.147 --> 37:54.649
Ma'am ...

37:58.569 --> 38:03.324
You might have to call the automobile
club to help me out of this.

38:07.703 --> 38:12.166
You looked so funny.
- I couldn't do a thing.

38:13.751 --> 38:18.756
What a marvellous-looking man.
I wonder if he's single.

38:21.008 --> 38:25.805
No idea how long I can get away
with this act, but she's worth it.

38:37.149 --> 38:42.113
Oon't just sit there.
Make some casual conversation.

38:42.530 --> 38:47.201
A lovely evening, isn't it?
- Yes. - Are you married?

38:48.744 --> 38:52.206
You kid. What are you doing?
Trying to scare him away?

38:52.623 --> 38:54.876
No, ma'am, I'm not.

38:55.293 --> 38:59.046
This may take
some fancy-looking field running.

38:59.964 --> 39:02.633
All those buildings full of people.

39:03.050 --> 39:06.345
Kind of scares
a country boy like me, you know it?

39:08.556 --> 39:10.892
Isn't that sweet?

39:11.309 --> 39:15.938
So unpretentious and honest.

39:16.355 --> 39:21.194
What a relief after a few monsters,
like Tony Walters and that ...

39:21.611 --> 39:23.529
Brad Allen.

39:27.700 --> 39:30.286
They all had a large family but me.
I'm the only child.

39:30.703 --> 39:34.040
Really? There were 6 of us.
4 brothers and 2 sisters.

39:34.457 --> 39:39.295
That's what I call a nice size.
You don't see much of that anymore.

39:40.588 --> 39:43.049
I believe in large familes. Oon't you?

39:43.466 --> 39:47.053
Yes indeedy. Seems like folks now
have just stopped having kids.

39:47.470 --> 39:49.764
May l, ma'am?
- Thank you.

39:50.181 --> 39:53.518
lt must be the high cost of living.
- Or television.

39:55.353 --> 39:58.940
Between the late-show at night
and Oave Garroway in the morning,

39:59.357 --> 40:02.318
it seems like there ain't much time.

40:08.908 --> 40:10.576
How about a coffee?

40:11.160 --> 40:13.246
No, ma'am.

40:14.288 --> 40:19.043
I ain't used to these hours.
Back home we'd be just getting up now.

40:21.045 --> 40:22.088
Well,

40:23.256 --> 40:26.092
it's been a real pleasure, ma'am.

40:26.509 --> 40:29.387
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

40:29.804 --> 40:34.016
Oon't let him go without your number.
You may never see him again.

40:34.433 --> 40:35.476
Mr. Stetson!

40:37.019 --> 40:40.773
Ma'am?
- Since you're all alone in New York,

40:41.190 --> 40:45.528
if there's anything you need
and I can help, my number is Plaza 2

40:45.945 --> 40:49.031
2-7-4-8.
- 2-2-7

40:49.448 --> 40:50.700
4-8.

40:51.117 --> 40:54.579
I'll remember that. Bye.
- Bye.

40:56.122 --> 40:59.750
I'd say 5 or 6 days ought to do it.

41:01.377 --> 41:05.923
It's so nice to meet a man
you feel you can trust.

41:08.634 --> 41:12.096
He respected you.
He didn't even try to kiss you.

41:12.513 --> 41:14.891
Maybe you just don't appeal to him.

41:15.933 --> 41:18.352
He didn't write your number down.

41:18.769 --> 41:22.023
Why didn't you think to ask
where he was staying?

41:28.988 --> 41:33.201
Hello?
- Ma'am, this is Rex Stetson.

41:34.410 --> 41:37.830
Hello. - I hope
I didn't wake you up.

41:38.873 --> 41:44.170
Not at all. - I just had to think
about your generous offer and all,

41:44.587 --> 41:47.632
to call you
in case I needed something.

41:49.050 --> 41:51.427
I need to go out for dinner tomorrow

41:51.844 --> 41:55.431
and I would enjoy seeing
a friendly face across the table.

41:55.848 --> 41:58.684
But if you're busy tomorrow ...

41:59.101 --> 42:03.856
No, I always keep tomorrow open.
I mean, I hadn't planned a thing.

42:04.273 --> 42:06.901
I'd love to have dinner with you.

42:07.318 --> 42:11.572
Hello, is anybody on this line?
- Yes, I am. Would you get off it?

42:11.989 --> 42:15.159
Alright, but it's my half-hour.

42:15.576 --> 42:19.580
Rex, are you there?
- Yes, ma'am. Who was that?

42:20.414 --> 42:24.460
A horrible man on my line.
- He isn't very well-mannered.

42:24.877 --> 42:27.797
Mannered?
He isn't even worth talking about.

42:28.214 --> 42:29.382
Now ...

42:32.552 --> 42:34.929
What were you saying?

42:35.346 --> 42:40.768
I'll stop by about 7:30.
- Alright. That'll be fine.

42:41.811 --> 42:43.604
Miss Morrow?

42:44.021 --> 42:47.692
I never could make
fancy speeches, but ...

42:48.109 --> 42:51.737
I get a nice, warm feeling
when I'm near you.

42:52.155 --> 42:57.368
It's like being by a pot-bellied stove
on a frosty morning.

43:02.498 --> 43:08.045
Oh Rex, what a lovely thing to say.

43:08.462 --> 43:11.299
Goodnight, ma'am.

43:12.341 --> 43:14.343
Goodnight.

43:23.895 --> 43:28.900
Like a pot-bellied stove
on a frosty morning.

43:31.903 --> 43:34.280
He does like you.

43:45.791 --> 43:48.836
Hello?
- Miss Morrow, Brad Allen.

43:49.253 --> 43:51.130
Hello? Hello?

43:52.632 --> 43:55.885
Yes? - I couldn't help overhearing
part of your conversation.

43:56.302 --> 44:00.515
I'm sure you couldn't.
- I feel responsible for you.

44:00.932 --> 44:04.560
Oon't go out with that man.
He's a phoney.

44:04.977 --> 44:08.564
Of course, it's not my business.
- Right, it's not your business.

44:08.981 --> 44:11.359
Oon't let that yokel act fool you.

44:11.776 --> 44:16.113
This ranch-hand Romeo is trying
to lure you into the next barn.

44:16.531 --> 44:19.367
Oon't judge other people by yourself.

44:19.784 --> 44:25.122
If you don't want to listen. But l
know exactly what he'll do tomorrow.

44:25.540 --> 44:27.667
You'll go to dinner, then dancing.

44:28.084 --> 44:31.254
Then he'll find an excuse
to stop off at his hotel.

44:31.671 --> 44:36.175
That is where the payoff comes.
- Goodnight, Mr. Allen.

45:05.705 --> 45:08.457
This is it.

45:08.875 --> 45:10.585
What?
- My hotel.

45:11.002 --> 45:14.755
You don't mind if we stop
for a minute to get my coat?

45:15.173 --> 45:17.341
It's a bit chilly out.

45:20.303 --> 45:22.638
The payoff.

45:31.147 --> 45:36.027
One thing about New York.
Nice, big hotel rooms.

45:36.444 --> 45:38.279
And ...

45:38.696 --> 45:42.909
mighty comfortable beds.
Come on over here.

45:54.295 --> 45:58.716
Ain't that a pretty view
of Central Park?

46:01.219 --> 46:03.888
Mighty romantic, ain't it?

46:08.935 --> 46:11.020
Well, let's go.

46:14.857 --> 46:18.778
You really came up for your coat?
- What did you think?

46:19.195 --> 46:22.824
I thought ...
- Thought what, ma'am?

46:23.866 --> 46:27.453
I thought
you brought me up here to ...

46:28.037 --> 46:31.874
Ma'am!
- I'm sorry, Rex.

46:32.291 --> 46:38.047
I should have known you're different.
But I had to make sure. Am I forgiven?

46:41.217 --> 46:42.969
Of course.

46:44.011 --> 46:46.055
I guess I can't blame you.

46:46.472 --> 46:50.309
Living in bear country
makes you wonder about strange caves.

46:50.726 --> 46:54.230
Now, let's got for that drive.

47:03.030 --> 47:04.365
This way.

47:04.782 --> 47:07.368
I thought we were going for a drive.
- We are.

47:07.785 --> 47:08.995
Back-home style.

47:20.047 --> 47:21.465
You know something?

47:21.883 --> 47:24.510
Whenever I miss home,

47:24.927 --> 47:28.890
the only thing that helps
is getting behind a horse.

47:31.726 --> 47:36.606
There's something wholesome
about a man who loves animals.

47:37.023 --> 47:40.985
I hope this stupid horse
knows where to go.

47:43.905 --> 47:47.033
Hangs on to the reins
like a subway strap.

47:47.450 --> 47:52.538
I don't know what he's planning,
but I'm glad she's not my daughter.

48:07.595 --> 48:10.640
Here is the ranch house.

48:11.057 --> 48:15.186
Right here is the corral,
that's where I keep my ponies.

48:15.603 --> 48:19.398
And here
behind the ranch house is a mountain.

48:19.816 --> 48:22.485
Not a huge mountain, but it's ours.

48:26.072 --> 48:27.865
Texas must be pretty.

48:28.783 --> 48:31.953
Yes, it is. lt is.

48:34.956 --> 48:37.708
I'm eating alone today.
I'll be right back.

48:44.715 --> 48:47.093
I seem to be out of cigarettes.

48:47.510 --> 48:50.847
Would you excuse me?
- Bye. - Bye.

49:17.748 --> 49:21.210
Fred,
you've got to come and help me out.

49:21.627 --> 49:26.716
I'll make you a deal. If you come
and take her off my hands, I'll ...

49:27.133 --> 49:28.176
Fred?

49:31.596 --> 49:34.140
Hey, Brad. Fred who?

49:34.557 --> 49:38.686
Jonathon old pal.
Good to see you.

49:39.103 --> 49:41.105
Your check, sir.
- Thanks, Cathy.

49:41.522 --> 49:44.609
Come on. I want to introduce
you to someone. - Who?

49:45.026 --> 49:49.197
Friend of the family. Visiting here.
Wonderful girl.

49:49.614 --> 49:52.366
But I wanted to work
on those songs of yours ...

49:52.783 --> 49:56.996
Why don't you take her over for me?
- Me? - Yeah.

49:57.413 --> 50:00.958
Go dancing. She's dying to learn
how to dance. - Wait.

50:01.375 --> 50:04.420
She can't dance?
- She doesn't get out much.

50:04.837 --> 50:08.716
What do you mean much?
- Believe me, you and Moose,

50:09.133 --> 50:11.469
I mean Miss Tagget ...
- Moose?

50:11.886 --> 50:16.265
So a girl picks up a nickname.
Kids can be cruel.

50:16.682 --> 50:21.687
Especially if someone is different.
- Now just a minute. How different?

50:22.104 --> 50:27.026
Well, just different.

50:27.443 --> 50:30.404
You know.
- Wait.

50:30.822 --> 50:32.907
Is that the one there?

50:37.119 --> 50:39.455
How can you tell?

50:44.418 --> 50:47.463
See how nice and friendly she is?

50:52.426 --> 50:54.720
Jonathon! - Are you kidding?
- You've got to help me out.

50:55.137 --> 50:58.599
Sorry, pal. It's your moose.

50:59.809 --> 51:01.602
Happy hunting.

51:05.898 --> 51:07.775
Yes indeedy.

52:05.833 --> 52:07.418
Beatnik!

52:18.721 --> 52:22.558
Hello?
- Morning, Miss Morrow. This is Rex.

52:22.975 --> 52:27.939
Good morning, Rex.
- You done did a terrible thing to me.

52:28.981 --> 52:31.526
You made me glad I ain't in Texas.

52:33.027 --> 52:34.654
Have l?

52:35.696 --> 52:37.573
Every time I look at you, I say:

52:37.990 --> 52:43.162
we got all kinds of natural resources
back home, we ain't got that.

52:44.831 --> 52:48.084
Oh Rex.
- Tell you something else, too.

52:48.501 --> 52:51.087
I hated New York when I first came.

52:51.504 --> 52:54.966
All those people
seemed so distant and all.

52:56.008 --> 52:59.804
Oon't feel that way now.
- That's good.

53:00.221 --> 53:04.433
lt sure turned out
to be a friendly town.

53:04.851 --> 53:08.855
You'll find that most people
will try to meet you halfway.

53:09.272 --> 53:13.025
If you let them.
- Will I see you tonight?

53:13.442 --> 53:17.155
I'd love to, Rex,
but I already have a date tonight.

53:17.572 --> 53:22.118
Who with? - A client.
You don't know him. Jonathon Forbes.

53:24.120 --> 53:28.207
You ain't the kind of gal
who'd break a date.

53:28.624 --> 53:30.168
No, I'm not.

53:30.585 --> 53:32.837
And I ain't the kind of guy
that'd ask you to.

53:33.254 --> 53:37.383
I know that. - I'll pick you up at 8.
- I'll be ready.

53:40.094 --> 53:41.929
What a day.

53:42.346 --> 53:45.308
Good morning, Alma.
Isn't it a beautiful day?

53:45.725 --> 53:47.894
You can't go by me. Haven't seen it.

53:49.395 --> 53:51.981
Okay, I'll take your word for it.

53:53.024 --> 53:56.777
He must be pretty special
if you'd break a date for him.

54:00.031 --> 54:02.074
He is.

54:02.492 --> 54:04.410
What's he like?

54:04.827 --> 54:07.455
He's six-foot-six,

54:07.872 --> 54:10.875
handsome, intelligent,

54:11.292 --> 54:15.129
owns a mountain.
- Oon't just stand there.

54:15.546 --> 54:18.424
Get that robe off
and go get him. - What?

54:18.841 --> 54:22.136
Six-foot-six-inches of opportunity
doesn't come every day.

54:23.638 --> 54:25.806
Alma, I hardly know the man.

54:26.224 --> 54:29.685
Takes only one sip of wine
to tell if it's a good bottle.

54:33.481 --> 54:34.816
This one is good.

54:35.858 --> 54:38.361
What are you waiting for? Orink up.

54:38.778 --> 54:43.699
Jan, are you evading my question?
- Would you like these initialled?

54:44.116 --> 54:47.036
Why did you break our date?
Had another date, huh?

54:47.453 --> 54:50.456
You're going out with someone else?

54:50.873 --> 54:53.626
Right?
- What a cruel thing to say.

54:54.043 --> 54:56.963
Who is he? - Rex Stetson.
- Oo I know him? - No.

54:57.380 --> 55:00.299
He's visiting from Texas.
- Texas!

55:00.716 --> 55:05.596
Jan, how could you ever fall in love
with a tourist?

55:06.013 --> 55:10.810
I don't know, I just did.
- You admit it. You love him.

55:12.103 --> 55:17.150
I did, didn't l?
- I'll never understand women.

55:18.192 --> 55:21.154
What a blow to my psyche.

55:21.571 --> 55:25.241
Rejected for a cowboy.
- He's not a cowboy.

55:25.658 --> 55:28.161
Alright, an oilman.

55:28.578 --> 55:31.706
Jan, if you marry him,
you'll have to live out there.

55:32.123 --> 55:33.166
Look at that.

55:33.791 --> 55:35.168
New York!

55:35.585 --> 55:39.755
People jostling, shoving, flailing
for their lives. You're part of it.

55:40.173 --> 55:44.260
In Texas there's nothing
but a bunch of prairie dogs and stuff.

55:44.677 --> 55:46.679
Even the air is nothing but air.

55:47.096 --> 55:50.224
You can feel the air in New York.
It's got character.

55:51.309 --> 55:53.811
Jan, you can't live in Texas.

55:56.564 --> 55:59.775
We haven't even talked about marriage.
- But it's in your look.

56:00.193 --> 56:03.821
I know well enough when a girl
is willing to talk about it.

56:05.031 --> 56:09.368
Oo I look willing?
- You look disgusting.

56:12.663 --> 56:17.293
I'm sorry. You know me.
I say a lot of things I don't mean.

56:17.710 --> 56:19.670
I just want you to be happy.

56:21.255 --> 56:24.258
If you want Rex Stetson,
I hope you get him.

56:56.415 --> 56:58.334
Excuse me.

56:58.751 --> 57:01.087
May I help you?

57:02.129 --> 57:03.756
Yes.

57:04.173 --> 57:06.175
I need an appointment.

57:06.592 --> 57:08.928
For your wife?
- No, I'm not married.

57:13.891 --> 57:14.934
For myself.

57:18.104 --> 57:22.942
The doctor should examine you?
- I'm not feeling too well.

57:23.359 --> 57:27.488
Maybe just an upset stomach,
but a guy can't be too careful.

57:29.282 --> 57:31.033
I'll tell the doctor you're here.

57:32.618 --> 57:36.122
There's no need to break in.
I let it go this long,

57:36.539 --> 57:41.127
I can put it off another few days.
- He'll be very anxious to see you.

57:54.974 --> 57:57.185
Tell her I'm feeling much better.

57:57.602 --> 58:00.646
It's probably just a false alarm.

58:05.693 --> 58:08.696
Where is he?
- He must have just gone.

58:10.156 --> 58:11.949
Excuse me.

58:16.412 --> 58:19.499
A man said he was going to have
a baby and you let him go?

58:19.916 --> 58:24.587
He was obviously a psychopath.
- And if he wasn't? - But Or. Maxwell.

58:25.004 --> 58:30.218
Miss Resnick, medical science
still has many unknowns to explore.

58:34.305 --> 58:38.226
You're the detective agency. I only
know his name and where he's from.

58:38.643 --> 58:40.770
I want everything on him.

58:41.813 --> 58:46.651
You helped me with 3 divorces.
Now how about a marriage. What?

58:47.068 --> 58:50.154
If it saves time, I'll be right over.

58:50.905 --> 58:51.948
Yes?

58:53.908 --> 58:56.327
Mr. Allen is here.
- I can't see him. - Sure can.

58:56.744 --> 59:00.790
I give you three solid-gold hits.
- Leave them on my desk.

59:01.207 --> 59:04.544
Where are you going?
- Remember that girl Jan?

59:04.961 --> 59:07.296
Who?
- Jan, with the party-line nut.

59:07.713 --> 59:12.927
Oh yeah. What about her?
- She met a Texas cowboy

59:13.344 --> 59:17.723
and fell for him. - How do you know?
- She told me. But I'll break it up.

59:18.140 --> 59:24.397
You will? - Yeah. - How?
- He needs to get up early to best me.

59:32.446 --> 59:35.074
Hello?
- Miss Morrow, Brad Allen.

59:35.491 --> 59:38.286
I'm in a hurry. If you don't mind.
- Of course.

59:38.703 --> 59:42.665
But you must admit, I was right.
- About what?

59:43.082 --> 59:46.961
Your Wild West gentleman.
He turned out to be a prairie wolf.

59:47.378 --> 59:49.547
This may surprise you,

59:49.964 --> 59:53.217
but there are some men
who are little more cultivated.

59:53.634 --> 59:57.722
You mean he didn't try to get you
up to his hotel room?

59:58.139 --> 01:00:00.433
Yes, he took me there.

01:00:00.850 --> 01:00:05.730
He showed me Central Park.
- And nothing else? - Nothing.

01:00:07.899 --> 01:00:11.027
Worse than I thought.
- Worse? What do you mean?

01:00:11.444 --> 01:00:14.447
Must I spell it out?

01:00:14.864 --> 01:00:18.910
Either you're lying, or ...
- Or what?

01:00:19.327 --> 01:00:24.207
There are some men
who are devoted to their mothers.

01:00:24.624 --> 01:00:28.044
The type that likes to collect recipes

01:00:28.461 --> 01:00:30.296
or exchange bits of gossip.

01:00:30.713 --> 01:00:35.259
What a vicious thing to say.
- I hope I'm wrong, but ...

01:00:35.676 --> 01:00:40.264
Shouldn't you make sure?
- You are sick.

01:00:41.891 --> 01:00:44.685
This isn't Rex Stetson. This is ...

01:00:46.103 --> 01:00:47.396
my best friend.

01:00:48.147 --> 01:00:53.361
They're usually the ones.
- I can't believe it.

01:00:54.570 --> 01:00:57.949
Hello? It's for you.
- Thanks.

01:00:58.366 --> 01:00:59.408
Graham.

01:01:01.327 --> 01:01:03.538
Good work.

01:01:03.955 --> 01:01:05.998
Get your coat, Mr. Forbes.
- Why?

01:01:06.415 --> 01:01:11.671
I had someone tail him. He and the
girl just went into The Hidden Ooor.

01:01:12.088 --> 01:01:14.590
The Hidden Ooor.

01:01:15.633 --> 01:01:19.762
My psychiatrist was right.
Never trust anyone other than him.

01:01:25.852 --> 01:01:29.188
Is this "Roly-Poly"?
- Yes, it is. - I love it.

01:01:39.115 --> 01:01:40.783
He's a fat one.

01:01:46.873 --> 01:01:47.915
Come on.

01:02:02.096 --> 01:02:03.514
You know this.

01:02:03.931 --> 01:02:06.184
I don't know all the words.
- Come on, Jan.

01:02:06.601 --> 01:02:08.144
"When I first laid eyes on him

01:02:08.561 --> 01:02:10.605
I laughed like all the rest.

01:02:11.022 --> 01:02:15.485
The more I saw
the more of him I liked best.

01:02:15.902 --> 01:02:20.198
Now the roly-poly man,
I point at him with pride.

01:02:20.615 --> 01:02:24.702
He's my roly-poly man,
I'm satisfied. I call him

01:02:25.119 --> 01:02:27.288
Ya-Ya Roly-Poly ..."

01:02:39.592 --> 01:02:40.927
Sing another one.

01:02:41.344 --> 01:02:42.887
Another one?

01:02:44.013 --> 01:02:48.810
"Just to put my arms
around him takes a week.

01:02:49.227 --> 01:02:52.980
But when I do,
we cuddle cheek-to-cheek.

01:02:53.397 --> 01:02:57.443
Got a roly-poly baby,
sweet as I can find.

01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:00.988
He's just a roly-poly,
that's only mine.

01:03:01.405 --> 01:03:04.742
I call him
- Roly-Poly ..."

01:03:25.888 --> 01:03:31.102
Thanks. That's great.
- Wasn't that fun? I love that.

01:03:39.026 --> 01:03:42.280
Tell me about your job.
lt must be exciting,

01:03:42.697 --> 01:03:46.159
working with all them colors
and fabrics and all.

01:03:55.585 --> 01:03:56.919
Rex ...

01:04:03.176 --> 01:04:04.218
Like some dip?

01:04:05.261 --> 01:04:07.346
I'd love to.

01:04:08.389 --> 01:04:09.724
Thank you.

01:04:16.939 --> 01:04:21.110
Ain't this tasty?
Wonder if I could get the recipe.

01:04:22.278 --> 01:04:26.115
Sure would like to surprise
my ma, when I get back.

01:04:30.828 --> 01:04:34.832
Rex, don't you find me attractive?

01:04:36.083 --> 01:04:40.546
Why yes, of course.

01:04:40.963 --> 01:04:44.133
Why haven't you ever ...
- Ever what?

01:04:46.177 --> 01:04:51.474
I feel so foolish.
- No. Go on, say what's on your mind.

01:04:51.891 --> 01:04:56.979
Whenever we go out
you've been a perfect gentleman.

01:04:57.396 --> 01:05:02.360
I hope I have.
- You have. And I appreciate it.

01:05:02.777 --> 01:05:05.071
But ...
- Yes?

01:05:05.488 --> 01:05:09.909
Well ... being such
a perfect gentleman and all,

01:05:10.326 --> 01:05:14.080
it's not very flattering.

01:05:14.872 --> 01:05:20.044
I wouldn't want to do anything
that might spoil our friendship.

01:05:23.923 --> 01:05:25.842
Is that all it is?

01:05:26.884 --> 01:05:27.927
Friendship?

01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:33.933
That's a direct question.
lt deserves a direct answer.

01:05:57.331 --> 01:05:59.083
If you'll excuse me.

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:02.837
I'd better go to the powder moon.
I mean room.

01:06:03.254 --> 01:06:05.339
Fix my lipstick.

01:06:18.644 --> 01:06:21.314
There's our man.
- Yes, I know him.

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:27.278
I can handle it from here.

01:06:31.949 --> 01:06:34.076
Need a light, cowboy?

01:06:38.831 --> 01:06:42.877
When are you leaving for the range?
- That's up to you.

01:06:43.294 --> 01:06:45.379
You've got 2 minutes.

01:06:45.796 --> 01:06:49.509
Oo this nice and clean,
so no one's embarrassed.

01:06:49.926 --> 01:06:52.929
When she gets back,
you'll say goodbye.

01:06:53.346 --> 01:06:55.640
You'll put her in a cab.

01:06:56.057 --> 01:06:59.310
And we'll go home and you'll pack.

01:06:59.727 --> 01:07:02.522
Where am I going?
- Connecticut.

01:07:02.939 --> 01:07:05.566
My summer house
is perfect for writing songs.

01:07:05.983 --> 01:07:09.320
No phone
and 20 miles to the nearest girl.

01:07:12.573 --> 01:07:16.536
Looks like I haven't much choice.
- Sure looks like it.

01:07:18.496 --> 01:07:21.123
Remember, I'll be watching you.

01:07:31.467 --> 01:07:34.178
Ma'am.
- Hello.

01:07:40.893 --> 01:07:44.605
I'm sure going to miss you,
leaving New York and all.

01:07:46.065 --> 01:07:47.275
You're leaving?
- Yeah.

01:07:47.692 --> 01:07:51.737
When? - Tonight.
I have to mosey up to Connecticut.

01:07:52.155 --> 01:07:54.240
Oidn't I tell you?
- No.

01:07:55.616 --> 01:07:56.659
No.

01:07:57.076 --> 01:07:59.537
This friend of mine,
a business associate,

01:07:59.954 --> 01:08:03.624
has a house up there
and he nearly forced me to use it.

01:08:04.041 --> 01:08:07.086
I just couldn't refuse him.

01:08:07.503 --> 01:08:11.215
Why must you ...?
- I may be buying the place ...

01:08:11.632 --> 01:08:14.510
I kind of want to get the feel of it.

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:22.477
How long will you be away?
- For the weekend.

01:08:22.894 --> 01:08:24.854
It's going to be lonely.

01:08:29.108 --> 01:08:30.943
You wouldn't consider ...

01:08:31.359 --> 01:08:33.446
Consider what?

01:08:34.447 --> 01:08:38.533
I'm afraid I couldn't ask you that.
- Ask me.

01:08:38.951 --> 01:08:40.286
Well ...

01:08:40.912 --> 01:08:44.916
No. lt wouldn't be proper.
- Rex, we're both over 21.

01:08:45.332 --> 01:08:47.627
I mean ...

01:08:48.044 --> 01:08:50.505
I must be able to trust you by now.

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:54.300
Ma'am,

01:08:54.716 --> 01:08:59.846
if I sent you home in a taxi,
how long would you need to pack?

01:09:00.598 --> 01:09:05.185
About an hour. - 45 minutes.
- We're wasting time.

01:09:11.234 --> 01:09:13.109
"You lied,

01:09:14.529 --> 01:09:16.154
you dog,

01:09:16.572 --> 01:09:21.077
and you'll be sorry.

01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:29.085
You lied, you hound.

01:09:29.502 --> 01:09:31.962
And that's not fair."

01:09:58.030 --> 01:10:00.241
Hello?
- Mr. Allen.

01:10:00.658 --> 01:10:03.870
So you realize
how wrong you are about Rex Stetson,

01:10:04.287 --> 01:10:07.415
he just asked me to go away
with him.

01:10:07.832 --> 01:10:09.208
He didn't.

01:10:09.625 --> 01:10:11.335
Are you going?

01:10:12.503 --> 01:10:15.631
That is something you'll never know.

01:10:20.511 --> 01:10:25.975
"You are my inspiration,
Jan Morrow."

01:10:36.402 --> 01:10:38.571
All set?
- All set.

01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:43.201
Just to make sure you work up there.

01:10:43.618 --> 01:10:45.244
I'll do my best.

01:10:45.661 --> 01:10:47.371
You better.

01:10:54.170 --> 01:10:55.671
Off you go.

01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:41.676
I feel guilty. I practically tricked
him into taking me along.

01:11:42.093 --> 01:11:44.971
You've gone out
with a lot of men before.

01:11:45.388 --> 01:11:47.765
But this is the jackpot.

01:11:48.182 --> 01:11:51.978
You cold?
- No. It's wonderful.

01:11:52.395 --> 01:11:54.939
If he only knew what I was thinking.

01:11:56.774 --> 01:11:58.860
"Hold me tight

01:11:59.277 --> 01:12:02.738
and kiss me right.

01:12:03.156 --> 01:12:06.367
I'm yours tongiht.

01:12:06.784 --> 01:12:11.122
My darling, possess me.

01:12:13.916 --> 01:12:19.672
Tenderly and breathlessly.

01:12:20.089 --> 01:12:23.301
Make love to me.

01:12:23.718 --> 01:12:28.014
My darling, possess me.

01:12:31.142 --> 01:12:32.727
Near to me ...

01:12:33.769 --> 01:12:37.899
When you're near to me,

01:12:39.484 --> 01:12:45.740
my heart forgets to beat.

01:12:50.953 --> 01:12:56.918
Stars that shine make dreams divine.

01:12:57.335 --> 01:13:00.421
So say you're mine

01:13:00.838 --> 01:13:05.092
and my darling, possess me."

01:13:10.139 --> 01:13:11.974
What did you say?

01:13:12.975 --> 01:13:14.977
Oidn't you say something?
- Me?

01:13:15.394 --> 01:13:16.771
No.

01:13:30.493 --> 01:13:32.036
May I help you?
- Yes.

01:13:32.453 --> 01:13:37.250
I've been trying to call
Miss Morrow and there's no answer.

01:13:37.667 --> 01:13:41.254
I wonder if anything is wrong.

01:13:41.671 --> 01:13:45.132
She's gone to Connecticut
for the weekend.

01:13:46.551 --> 01:13:51.305
Connecticut? - There's no phone number
but I have an address.

01:13:51.722 --> 01:13:54.225
241 Stony Brook Road?

01:13:54.642 --> 01:13:57.478
Why, yes, sir.
- And you let her go?

01:13:57.895 --> 01:14:01.357
lt wasn't my place ...
- No.

01:14:01.774 --> 01:14:05.069
It's my place.
And I helped him pack.

01:14:25.089 --> 01:14:26.966
Remember when I said

01:14:27.383 --> 01:14:32.972
that being near you is like being
near a pot-bellied stove? - Yes.

01:14:34.015 --> 01:14:37.518
I was wrong.
- You were?

01:14:37.935 --> 01:14:39.687
More like a forest fire.

01:14:40.104 --> 01:14:42.565
Completely out of control.

01:14:55.369 --> 01:14:57.538
You know something?

01:14:57.955 --> 01:15:00.750
Out here in the country
you're very different.

01:15:02.835 --> 01:15:06.672
I reckon I feel more at home.
For the first time.

01:15:08.424 --> 01:15:11.219
A man with a mountain
doesn't belong in the big city.

01:15:37.537 --> 01:15:39.539
Fire's nearly out.

01:15:43.918 --> 01:15:46.295
I'd better get some more logs.

01:15:52.176 --> 01:15:53.803
For later.

01:16:37.555 --> 01:16:38.598
Hurry back.

01:16:40.266 --> 01:16:44.145
Quicker than a cow-poke
chasing a chuck wagon.

01:18:48.811 --> 01:18:49.854
Jan, I ...

01:19:09.415 --> 01:19:11.959
Jan, please.

01:19:12.627 --> 01:19:16.172
Stop.
- Jonathon. - It's Brad Allen.

01:19:16.589 --> 01:19:18.966
I know that.
- He's a double-crossing rat.

01:19:19.383 --> 01:19:21.677
I know that.
Will you please take me home?

01:19:22.094 --> 01:19:23.888
Of course.

01:19:26.557 --> 01:19:28.434
Bedroom problems.

01:19:30.353 --> 01:19:34.774
Mine can be solved in one bedroom.
Yours couldn't be solved in 1,000.

01:19:37.693 --> 01:19:41.864
At least you could have brought
your own champagne.

01:20:31.497 --> 01:20:35.877
Jan,
you've been crying for 60 miles now.

01:20:36.294 --> 01:20:39.130
I know it.

01:20:39.547 --> 01:20:41.924
Oon't you think you can stop?

01:20:42.341 --> 01:20:45.553
I can't.

01:20:59.859 --> 01:21:04.947
A coffee will make you feel better.
- Excuse me. - That's fine, come on.

01:21:18.252 --> 01:21:20.171
Two coffees, please.

01:21:21.923 --> 01:21:24.592
Control yourself, Jan.

01:21:25.009 --> 01:21:28.721
I've never done this before.
- There has to be a first time.

01:21:29.138 --> 01:21:32.975
You don't have to come apart over it.
- I'm so ashamed.

01:21:33.392 --> 01:21:36.479
Poor kid.
- The guy drives a big car

01:21:36.896 --> 01:21:40.358
with all the extras.
Thinks he can get away with it.

01:21:41.901 --> 01:21:44.320
I thought we were going to marry.
- Forget it.

01:21:47.323 --> 01:21:49.659
Jan, you're becoming hysterical.

01:21:50.076 --> 01:21:54.747
I can't help it. - I hate to do it.
But it's for your own good.

01:22:00.002 --> 01:22:01.045
You see?

01:22:01.462 --> 01:22:02.630
You see?

01:22:10.721 --> 01:22:11.764
Jonathon!

01:22:15.518 --> 01:22:17.103
Jonathon!

01:22:23.151 --> 01:22:25.027
Your coffee, Mr. Forbes.

01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:37.415
Hello, Jonathon!

01:22:39.959 --> 01:22:41.627
What happened?

01:22:42.044 --> 01:22:46.174
I was jumped by 5 or 6 ruffians.
- What? - Just put it down.

01:22:46.591 --> 01:22:49.677
By rights
these loose teeth belong to you.

01:22:50.094 --> 01:22:52.889
I was only trying to stop her crying.
- Oid she cry?

01:22:53.306 --> 01:22:57.059
Cry? I didn't know a woman that size
had so much water in her.

01:22:57.477 --> 01:22:59.937
Have you seen her? - No.
- Have you talked to her? - No.

01:23:00.354 --> 01:23:04.567
My psychiatrist and my dentist said
I should give her up.

01:23:04.984 --> 01:23:06.944
Where have you been the last 3 days?

01:23:07.361 --> 01:23:10.239
I stayed up there,
working on the new songs.

01:23:10.656 --> 01:23:13.367
What have you done?
- This.

01:23:13.784 --> 01:23:16.579
And this. And this.
- Go on.

01:23:16.996 --> 01:23:21.292
I couldn't come up with a thing.
I sat there, feeling guilty.

01:23:21.709 --> 01:23:23.002
Guilty? You?

01:23:23.419 --> 01:23:28.341
I saw you work on 3 sisters at once.
You came up with your best songs.

01:23:28.758 --> 01:23:33.221
Now, just one girl makes you feel
guilty? - I don't know.

01:23:33.638 --> 01:23:38.351
What do you know. You're in love.

01:23:38.768 --> 01:23:41.312
The mighty tree has toppled.

01:23:41.729 --> 01:23:45.525
For years I've been waiting
for them to yell "timber" over you.

01:23:47.068 --> 01:23:49.028
You could be right.
- You're darn right.

01:23:49.445 --> 01:23:53.658
You love her
and she can't stand you.

01:23:54.075 --> 01:23:56.744
That's wonderful.
Wonderful.

01:23:57.161 --> 01:24:00.248
It's almost worth the loose teeth.

01:24:01.290 --> 01:24:03.918
Yeah?
- Miss Morrow is here.

01:24:04.335 --> 01:24:07.588
Tell her to come in.
- Is there a back way out?

01:24:08.005 --> 01:24:10.133
This'll be fun.

01:24:12.635 --> 01:24:14.387
Good morning.
- Jan.

01:24:14.804 --> 01:24:16.931
Here's the painting I mentioned.

01:24:17.348 --> 01:24:20.643
Let's get on with the hanging.
You know Brad Allen, don't you?

01:24:22.395 --> 01:24:24.021
The ex-Rex.

01:24:26.858 --> 01:24:30.444
The tables are coming at 4.
- Fine.

01:24:36.576 --> 01:24:37.785
Jan!

01:24:38.578 --> 01:24:39.996
Jan, wait.

01:24:42.498 --> 01:24:44.792
I don't blame you for hating me.

01:24:46.294 --> 01:24:48.462
I'm trying to apologize.

01:24:55.052 --> 01:24:56.762
Excuse me.

01:25:12.945 --> 01:25:17.492
Where did he go?
- I don't know, but he came out there.

01:25:17.909 --> 01:25:20.620
You let him go again?
- You don't believe ...

01:25:21.037 --> 01:25:25.124
A prejudiced view never advanced
the cause of science.

01:25:25.541 --> 01:25:30.505
Somewhere there may be a man
who's crossed a new frontier.

01:25:33.925 --> 01:25:36.844
How do I get her back?
- You don't.

01:25:37.261 --> 01:25:40.139
You suffer and I watch.
- There must be a way.

01:25:40.556 --> 01:25:42.683
There's got to.
- What a delightful situation.

01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:47.563
The great Brad Allen, chopped down
and floating with the rest of us logs.

01:25:47.980 --> 01:25:52.151
To win over a girl, you're nice
to her dog. - No dog.

01:25:52.568 --> 01:25:56.405
Then you're nice to her mother.
- Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

01:25:56.823 --> 01:25:59.742
If worse comes to worse,
you work on her maid. - Alma?

01:26:00.159 --> 01:26:02.829
You couldn't get to first base.

01:26:03.246 --> 01:26:04.747
Alma.

01:26:22.557 --> 01:26:24.016
Thanks a lot.

01:26:29.438 --> 01:26:31.732
Excuse me.
May I talk to you?

01:26:32.150 --> 01:26:33.192
Yes.

01:26:33.609 --> 01:26:38.406
My name is Brad Allen, and ...
- Mr. Allen, of course.

01:26:39.448 --> 01:26:42.160
Get lost.

01:26:42.577 --> 01:26:46.372
I'd know that voice anywhere.
- You know me?

01:26:47.290 --> 01:26:51.377
"You are my inspiration, Alma."

01:26:51.794 --> 01:26:53.045
The telephone.

01:26:53.671 --> 01:26:58.968
I'm one of the most devoted listeners.
- Thank you. - That's okay.

01:26:59.552 --> 01:27:03.723
It's chilly out here. How about
we stop for a drink somewhere?

01:27:04.765 --> 01:27:06.893
I don't usually.

01:27:07.310 --> 01:27:10.313
I might have one.
- Good.

01:27:10.730 --> 01:27:15.318
I know a nice little bar.
- I know a better one.

01:27:20.156 --> 01:27:22.450
Another one?

01:27:23.743 --> 01:27:26.329
No?
- No.

01:27:27.330 --> 01:27:30.917
Let's take this problem
from the beginning.

01:27:31.334 --> 01:27:36.130
You're in love with her
and you want to win her back.

01:27:36.547 --> 01:27:40.051
The first thing you do
is get her to talk to you.

01:27:40.468 --> 01:27:42.845
Right?
- Right.

01:27:43.262 --> 01:27:45.264
It's really very simple.

01:27:45.681 --> 01:27:49.477
You've got an apartment.
She decorates them.

01:27:49.894 --> 01:27:52.939
You hire her to do your place.

01:27:53.356 --> 01:27:58.277
Two people decorating an apartment
are pretty intimate. - lntimate.

01:27:58.694 --> 01:28:00.863
She's got to talk to you.

01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:04.200
Clever?
- Clever.

01:28:04.617 --> 01:28:08.746
Once you start talking
it's only a matter of time.

01:28:09.163 --> 01:28:10.581
Now remember,

01:28:10.998 --> 01:28:14.836
you hire her
to decorate your apartment.

01:28:16.546 --> 01:28:19.006
Okay?
- Okay.

01:28:21.551 --> 01:28:23.594
Happy?
- Happy.

01:28:24.971 --> 01:28:27.807
Would you care for a little snack?

01:28:43.739 --> 01:28:46.367
Hi, slugger. This'll fix you up.

01:28:46.784 --> 01:28:49.954
How do you feel?
- Oh, boy.

01:28:50.371 --> 01:28:53.499
I've had hangovers before,
but this one ...

01:28:53.916 --> 01:28:57.003
Even my hair hurts.
- And you wanted to get her drunk.

01:28:57.420 --> 01:29:01.299
The bottle of scotch was okay.
I lost her halfway through the vodka.

01:29:01.716 --> 01:29:05.428
This'll fix you up.
It's got a lot of olive oil in it.

01:29:07.054 --> 01:29:10.391
The State Oepartment could use her.

01:29:10.808 --> 01:29:13.603
What a party girl she'd be in Moscow.

01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:17.690
And two raw eggs.
- Oh, go away.

01:29:18.816 --> 01:29:20.985
Oidn't you find out anything?

01:29:22.528 --> 01:29:27.617
All I remember is this voice,
swimming through the scotch:

01:29:28.034 --> 01:29:30.703
"You've got an apartment.
She decorates them."

01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:33.748
"Right?"
- Right.

01:29:36.042 --> 01:29:40.129
Of course. Where does she work?

01:29:40.546 --> 01:29:44.884
Pierot's.
But she won't talk to you.

01:29:45.301 --> 01:29:46.511
But Pierot will.

01:29:46.928 --> 01:29:49.180
You know the number?
- Yeah.

01:29:52.141 --> 01:29:53.351
Oial it.

01:30:00.399 --> 01:30:01.776
Not so loud.

01:30:04.737 --> 01:30:06.155
What do you think?

01:30:07.573 --> 01:30:10.034
But you threw out all my ideas.

01:30:10.451 --> 01:30:13.371
Well ...
- I hate to say this,

01:30:13.788 --> 01:30:16.082
but you were right. This is better.

01:30:16.499 --> 01:30:19.252
If you repeat that to anyone,
you're fired.

01:30:19.669 --> 01:30:22.755
Tilda,
when you're back from the post office,

01:30:23.172 --> 01:30:26.134
call Brad Allen back.

01:30:26.551 --> 01:30:31.347
Tell me it's impossible.
He'll have to find someone else.

01:30:31.764 --> 01:30:33.349
Yes, sir.

01:30:38.062 --> 01:30:40.606
You're turning him down?
- I have to.

01:30:41.023 --> 01:30:44.318
But why?
- I haven't the time for him.

01:30:44.735 --> 01:30:49.282
And I can't send you,
not with how you feel about him.

01:30:49.699 --> 01:30:52.493
You shouldn't lose
a commission because of me.

01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:56.247
I couldn't subject you
to such an experience.

01:30:56.664 --> 01:31:00.501
lt might be,
how would you say, traumatic.

01:31:00.918 --> 01:31:03.421
That's silly.

01:31:03.838 --> 01:31:06.924
I once had the mumps.
but I got over it.

01:31:07.341 --> 01:31:10.219
Mumps? - I look upon
Brad Allen like any other disease.

01:31:10.636 --> 01:31:12.847
I've had him, it's over, I'm immune.

01:31:13.264 --> 01:31:16.267
If you think you can handle it.
- I certainly can.

01:31:16.684 --> 01:31:18.769
It's your decision.

01:31:36.704 --> 01:31:40.791
Mr. Allen? Pierot.
She's coming over.

01:31:45.046 --> 01:31:47.965
Miss Morrow.
I was expecting Mr. Pierot.

01:31:48.716 --> 01:31:53.054
Mr. Pierot is unavailable right now.
If you'd rather wait until ...

01:31:53.471 --> 01:31:57.600
No, no. You'll do just fine.
Please come in.

01:31:59.769 --> 01:32:01.813
It's just a little ...

01:32:02.230 --> 01:32:05.191
It's embarrassing.
- I'm a decorator, you're a client.

01:32:05.608 --> 01:32:09.779
I'm here because you are paying
for my services.

01:32:10.196 --> 01:32:13.366
Now, what style did you have in mind?

01:32:15.701 --> 01:32:18.079
Nothing in particular.

01:32:18.496 --> 01:32:21.290
I'm leaving that up to you.

01:32:23.125 --> 01:32:25.586
Now here ...

01:32:26.003 --> 01:32:27.880
This is where I work.

01:32:28.923 --> 01:32:32.552
Living room.
Over here is the kitchen, dining room.

01:32:32.969 --> 01:32:34.971
Over there ...
- And up there?

01:32:35.847 --> 01:32:36.931
The bedroom.

01:32:39.767 --> 01:32:42.979
And these?
- Light switches.

01:32:44.605 --> 01:32:47.942
Just switches.

01:32:48.359 --> 01:32:52.363
Aren't they inconvenient?
- Why, no.

01:32:53.906 --> 01:32:58.578
The man who lived here before me
had very long arms.

01:33:00.037 --> 01:33:01.164
Over here ...

01:33:01.581 --> 01:33:05.042
Mr. Allen,
I have to know what everything is for.

01:33:15.344 --> 01:33:16.888
This is the fireplace.

01:33:17.305 --> 01:33:20.933
What does the other switch do?
- It's just a light swtich.

01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:22.685
Please.

01:33:37.366 --> 01:33:39.785
Jan, I ...
- Why redecorate?

01:33:40.203 --> 01:33:43.706
It's so functional for your purposes.

01:33:44.749 --> 01:33:46.417
Not anymore.

01:33:46.834 --> 01:33:51.339
That's why I want you to redecorate.
That bed is the first to go.

01:33:51.756 --> 01:33:55.468
Anything you think is in bad taste,
throw it out.

01:33:55.885 --> 01:33:58.805
This should be the type of place ...

01:33:59.847 --> 01:34:01.098
Well ...

01:34:01.516 --> 01:34:04.018
... that you'd feel comfortable in.

01:34:05.436 --> 01:34:06.687
Good.

01:34:07.104 --> 01:34:08.439
Well.

01:34:09.482 --> 01:34:11.317
You take over.

01:34:11.734 --> 01:34:15.321
And I'll stay here
and do my work.

01:34:16.030 --> 01:34:19.242
I'm sorry.
You'll have to move out.

01:34:19.659 --> 01:34:21.869
Until I'm finished.
- Move out?

01:34:22.286 --> 01:34:25.414
You'd just be in the way
of the men working here.

01:34:25.832 --> 01:34:28.709
But there'll be things to discuss.

01:34:29.126 --> 01:34:31.796
You'll have to give me carte blanche.

01:34:32.213 --> 01:34:35.883
Well, I ... - If you feel that way ...
- No. I'll leave.

01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:39.137
Just do the place
the way you'd like it.

01:34:39.929 --> 01:34:41.430
I will.

01:35:02.952 --> 01:35:04.078
Tilda,

01:35:04.912 --> 01:35:09.333
call these shops.
I'm going to pick up a few things.

01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:14.172
We don't deal with any of these shops.
You know what their stuff is like.

01:35:15.047 --> 01:35:16.090
You bet I do.

01:35:16.507 --> 01:35:20.803
You didn't see that man's apartment.
He's got it down to a science.

01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:25.308
He pushes a button and the couch
becomes a bed with baby blue sheets.

01:35:25.725 --> 01:35:26.851
Really?

01:35:28.603 --> 01:35:31.230
And him acting so embarrassed.

01:35:31.647 --> 01:35:33.232
Big phoney.

01:35:33.649 --> 01:35:38.196
He's like a spider
and expects me to redecorate his web.

01:35:39.822 --> 01:35:42.867
Eileen? Brad.

01:35:43.284 --> 01:35:47.038
Oear, I want you
to be the first to know.

01:35:47.455 --> 01:35:52.251
I've met this girl,
I'm planning to marry her.

01:35:53.836 --> 01:35:57.423
Oh nonsense,
you have everything to live for.

01:35:58.674 --> 01:36:01.719
No. It's not nauseating enough.

01:36:02.386 --> 01:36:04.639
That one with the 2 heads.

01:36:05.056 --> 01:36:07.558
You're not serious?
- Wrap it.

01:36:08.142 --> 01:36:11.229
Marie? Brad.

01:36:11.646 --> 01:36:15.608
Oear, I want you
to be the first to know ...

01:36:16.359 --> 01:36:18.402
With big velour tassels.

01:36:18.820 --> 01:36:21.781
Tassels?
- Tassels!

01:36:22.824 --> 01:36:25.076
Goodbye, my dear.

01:36:33.626 --> 01:36:38.756
Yes, Mr. Allen. Your apartment
will be ready in the morning.

01:36:41.259 --> 01:36:45.096
There's just one final touch missing.

01:36:47.390 --> 01:36:48.683
Goodbye.

01:36:58.234 --> 01:37:02.697
Behold, Jonathon.
The work of a woman in love.

01:37:03.114 --> 01:37:04.323
Oh, no.

01:37:04.740 --> 01:37:07.827
I hope
you saved those telephone numbers.

01:37:25.636 --> 01:37:28.639
What?
- That chair, it bit me.

01:37:46.991 --> 01:37:49.660
Get dressed.
- Get out. - We're going to my place.

01:37:50.077 --> 01:37:53.247
I've seen it.
- So what. Get dressed. - No.

01:37:53.664 --> 01:37:55.917
Are you getting up
or do I come in after you?

01:37:56.542 --> 01:37:57.710
Oon't you dare.

01:38:01.964 --> 01:38:06.552
How dare you! Put me down.

01:38:06.969 --> 01:38:09.889
I said put me down.

01:38:10.932 --> 01:38:12.767
What are you doing?

01:38:13.184 --> 01:38:16.187
Where are you taking me?
Put me down.

01:38:16.604 --> 01:38:20.066
Good morning, Mrs. Wilson.
- Morning. - Take me back to bed.

01:38:20.483 --> 01:38:22.276
Oown, please.

01:38:22.693 --> 01:38:23.945
Harry,

01:38:24.362 --> 01:38:28.115
would you please call the police?

01:38:33.955 --> 01:38:34.997
Harry ...

01:38:35.414 --> 01:38:38.209
Alma, stop him.

01:38:38.626 --> 01:38:41.212
You wouldn't take me into the street.

01:38:58.646 --> 01:39:02.775
If I ever get
on my feet again, look out.

01:39:03.192 --> 01:39:04.944
Alma.

01:39:05.987 --> 01:39:10.491
That man just inspired me.
I should have done it long ago.

01:39:10.908 --> 01:39:13.494
You're too nice a looking woman
to drink all the time.

01:39:13.911 --> 01:39:17.039
You need a man
to take care of.

01:39:17.456 --> 01:39:20.460
Then you wouldn't have
so much time to drink.

01:39:20.877 --> 01:39:24.714
Harry, you're so strong.

01:39:34.599 --> 01:39:37.351
They'll never believe this
back in Wichita Falls.

01:39:38.394 --> 01:39:41.272
Officer,
this man is taking me up to his place.

01:39:41.689 --> 01:39:46.194
Can't blame him, Miss.
How's it going, Brad? - Fine, Kelly.

01:39:51.365 --> 01:39:56.412
Mommy, where's he taking her?
- I'll tell you when you're older.

01:40:03.878 --> 01:40:07.507
You got me here.
Now will you put me down?

01:40:07.924 --> 01:40:12.178
It's customary for the groom to
carry the bride across the threshold.

01:40:12.595 --> 01:40:13.638
Bride?

01:40:20.978 --> 01:40:23.231
The scene of the crime.
- Bride?

01:40:23.648 --> 01:40:28.194
Why did I spend a fortune? Why did l
cut myself off from every girl?

01:40:28.611 --> 01:40:32.532
Why does any man destroy himself?
Because he thinks he's going to marry.

01:40:32.949 --> 01:40:35.785
What does he get?
- Bride? - This.

01:40:36.202 --> 01:40:41.165
You did a great job here. You can stay
and charge admission.

01:41:19.871 --> 01:41:21.164
Ooctor!

01:41:22.206 --> 01:41:25.126
It's him!
- Him?

01:41:25.543 --> 01:41:30.339
Would you mind coming into my office?
- Not now, I have to see a friend.

01:41:30.756 --> 01:41:34.427
Just for a moment. - I have important
news. - Only a few minutes.

01:41:34.844 --> 01:41:38.848
I'm going to have a baby.
- Of course you are.

01:41:40.766 --> 01:41:42.852
Wait a minute. Jonathon.
