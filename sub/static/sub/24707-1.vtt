00:01.194 --> 00:03.135
Last season on NYPD Blue.

00:03.209 --> 00:06.274
If you're interested, John, there's a P.A.A. Slot
open upstairs in Anticrime.

00:06.344 --> 00:08.099
Don't tease me.

00:08.166 --> 00:11.328
- I was thinking maybe we could go over there.
- That's a long way for lunch.

00:11.397 --> 00:13.852
- I mean, dinner.
- James, I don't think that's a good idea.

00:13.924 --> 00:17.403
I sort ofhave a rule about not getting
involved with anyone on thejob.

00:17.475 --> 00:20.288
- Twenty-four more hours, huh, Andy?
- Till what?

00:20.353 --> 00:22.654
- Your wedding.
- Yeah, tomorrow.

00:22.720 --> 00:25.566
Isn't this one of those things we swear
to ourselves we're going to avoid?

00:25.631 --> 00:28.630
Yeah. But let's do it anyway.

00:28.702 --> 00:31.483
Mm, uh, just a second.

00:33.340 --> 00:37.615
Andy thought you might have been drinking
last night when you showed up at the hospital.

00:37.690 --> 00:40.111
- I had wine with my dinner.
- He's concerned that you might have a problem.

00:40.185 --> 00:42.094
A.A. People think everybody's a drunk.

00:42.168 --> 00:45.778
Look at that beautiful girl.

01:11.916 --> 01:13.889
Morning.

01:13.963 --> 01:19.046
- Morning.
- I was, uh, wondering if you had a chance to talk to him.

01:19.113 --> 01:21.566
- I just got here.
- But you still intend to talk to him.

01:21.640 --> 01:24.420
- What'd I tell you after the meeting?
- I know. I was just...

01:24.486 --> 01:27.867
- worried maybe you'd changed your mind.
- No.

01:27.940 --> 01:31.289
- I have no idea what Bobby's attitude's gonna be.
- That's up to him.

01:31.363 --> 01:33.915
I feel like a goofball worrying about it.

01:33.986 --> 01:36.832
- You take it how it comes.
- I know.

01:36.897 --> 01:40.922
And don't be hovering around me all day.
You gotta let me do this how I'm gonna do it.

01:40.992 --> 01:45.245
Yeah.
Andy, um, I appreciate everything.

01:45.310 --> 01:48.920
Well, you've shown me
a lot these last few months...

01:48.988 --> 01:51.442
on and off the job.

01:51.515 --> 01:56.694
You want to not go in together in case
he's up there, you get a chance to talk?

01:56.760 --> 01:58.669
Walk inside.

02:12.913 --> 02:14.822
So this is your statement here?

02:14.896 --> 02:17.416
- Right.
- This is how you got robbed?

02:17.488 --> 02:19.974
- That's what
happened. - Hey. - Hi.

02:20.046 --> 02:22.794
- Good morning.
- Hey.

02:22.862 --> 02:25.675
You know, Detective, I woke up on
the wrong side of the bed today...

02:25.740 --> 02:28.293
- and I think I'm gonna be doing a disservice here to Mr. White.
- What's going on?

02:28.364 --> 02:30.273
- Mr. White got robbed last night.
- Uh-huh.

02:30.346 --> 02:32.287
He was driving down
South Street, 100 a.m...

02:32.361 --> 02:34.367
How'd you put it?
Collecting your thoughts?

02:34.440 --> 02:36.033
- Yes.
- On South Street?

02:36.104 --> 02:38.688
Yeah, just driving down South Street
collecting his thoughts...

02:38.759 --> 02:40.831
when he stops for a stop light.

02:40.901 --> 02:43.618
An assailant walks up, demands his car,
his wallet and his pants.

02:43.685 --> 02:46.531
- His pants too? Hm!
- I mentioned to Mr. White...

02:46.596 --> 02:49.628
this pattern we've been working on
where the prostitute gets into the car...

02:49.698 --> 02:52.696
and points the john to some
romantic parking lot off of South Street...

02:52.768 --> 02:55.386
and then her hardworking pimp shows up
and sticks a gun in his face;

02:55.455 --> 02:57.822
how we got two detectives
on the street right now...

02:57.887 --> 03:00.373
trying to put a stop to this
before somebody gets shot.

03:00.445 --> 03:03.291
But he can't help us with that
because this case is unrelated.

03:03.356 --> 03:06.453
This is a whole separate phenomena here,
because, uh...

03:06.522 --> 03:08.889
there's no prostitute involved,
right, Mr. White?

03:08.954 --> 03:12.019
- I told you what happened.
- Mr. White told me what happened...

03:12.089 --> 03:15.403
so he can't be of help on this pattern
that we've been working on...

03:15.479 --> 03:19.569
where we got these two cops
out on the street busting their ass.

03:19.637 --> 03:24.938
I'm feeling kind of bad now, 'cause, uh,
I thought Mr. White might be Iying to me.

03:25.011 --> 03:28.392
Well, maybe being in a strange police station,
he just can't remember right.

03:28.466 --> 03:31.465
- Maybe he needs more familiar surroundings.
- Could that be, Mr. White?

03:31.536 --> 03:34.797
Try taking him over to his house
and talking it out with his wife in the room.

03:34.863 --> 03:36.804
- See if maybe that mightjog his memory.
- Wait.

03:36.878 --> 03:39.560
- No, I think we should do that.
- All right, all right.

03:39.629 --> 03:41.930
All right.

03:41.996 --> 03:45.770
Good-looking black girl, 5'2".

03:45.835 --> 03:47.841
Where'd you pick her up?

03:47.913 --> 03:49.822
13th and Second Avenue.

03:49.896 --> 03:53.124
Did she give you a name?

03:53.255 --> 03:55.109
Hey, Sal! Wait up!

03:55.174 --> 03:59.613
2.50. I figure the guy must've
thought I ordered a muffin too.

03:59.684 --> 04:02.682
- Notice how they didn't have the prices posted.
- Yeah.

04:02.755 --> 04:06.496
- Two and a half bucks. Coffee and no muffin.
- We should've just walked out:

04:06.561 --> 04:08.894
- Sorry, pal. I work for a living."
- Nah.

04:08.960 --> 04:11.578
- That would've been even more of an embarrassment.
- Forget about it.

04:11.647 --> 04:13.981
Where's this pimp
we're supposed to meet?

04:14.046 --> 04:16.728
How reliable is his information
gonna be anyway is my concern.

04:16.797 --> 04:19.731
- Is he just looking to settle a score?
- Hey! You're the police?

04:19.803 --> 04:22.258
- The bar's over there. Hurry!
- Wait, wait! What bar?

04:22.331 --> 04:24.850
I called the 911 operator.
Something bad is happening.

04:24.922 --> 04:28.019
We don't know nothing about a 911 call.
What's going on in there?

04:28.088 --> 04:31.534
Okay, I was upstairs. We have a signal.
My husband, he buzzed me.

04:31.606 --> 04:35.663
I call 911. I go out the backstairs.
Something bad is happening- I think a robbery.

04:35.733 --> 04:38.699
- Okay, we're gonna check it out. Stay right there.
- Calm down.

04:47.632 --> 04:52.137
Police! Put your hands on the bar
and don't move! Do it now!

04:52.205 --> 04:55.204
Whoa, whoa! It's all right.
I'm on the job. It's taken care of.

04:55.277 --> 04:57.578
Hands on the bar right now!
You're on whatjob?

04:57.644 --> 05:00.130
Just check my I.D., all right?
Let me show you my shield.

05:00.202 --> 05:04.030
Yeah, take it out slow. You!
What's going on? You speak English?

05:04.105 --> 05:06.625
All right?

05:06.696 --> 05:09.564
Let me see it. Let me see it!

05:09.639 --> 05:13.793
What is this crap? I just showed you
the damn shield, man. I tell you I'm on the job.

05:13.860 --> 05:16.227
Why have you still got
your gun pointed at me, huh?

05:16.292 --> 05:20.513
Oh, I got it.
I'm black, so you can't believe a word I say.

05:22.049 --> 05:25.244
Okay. Now, what's the story?

05:28.894 --> 05:30.835
Bastard!

05:43.448 --> 05:45.171
Oh!

05:47.094 --> 05:49.647
- Aah!
- Damn it!

05:50.804 --> 05:53.259
Hey, Greg! I've been shot!

05:53.332 --> 05:55.949
I've been shot, man!

05:56.019 --> 05:59.083
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my God.

05:59.153 --> 06:01.673
15th Squad to Central.

06:01.744 --> 06:04.493
1013. My partner's been shot.

06:04.560 --> 06:07.558
We're at 11 th Street and Second Avenue,
an alley in the back.

06:07.630 --> 06:09.539
Can you get up?

06:09.613 --> 06:11.979
- I don't know. I've been hit.
- Come on. Come on.

06:12.045 --> 06:13.953
- Man!
- Come on.

06:14.027 --> 06:16.208
I'm taking you to the hospital.

07:30.193 --> 07:32.200
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:44.618 --> 07:47.399
- Hi, Bobby.
- Hey, Donna.

07:51.816 --> 07:53.725
- Can I pour you a cup?
- Great.

07:53.799 --> 07:55.685
- Coffee, right?
- Yeah.

07:55.750 --> 07:58.466
- There you go.
- Is that Fahrenheit you're wearing?

07:58.533 --> 08:01.249
- Yeah, it is.
- It's a great scent on you.

08:01.316 --> 08:03.224
Thanks.

08:05.121 --> 08:09.114
- I'm just not used to folks around here taking notice.
- Really?

08:09.184 --> 08:11.867
Listen up. James has been shot.

08:11.935 --> 08:15.795
- Where are we going?
- The shooting was at 11 th and Second Avenue.

08:15.869 --> 08:18.835
Medavoy's taking him to the hospital.
I'm on my way over there.

08:18.908 --> 08:21.557
I want everybody at the scene.

08:35.157 --> 08:38.190
- You're gonna be okay.
- Wasn't what I thought it would feel like.

08:38.259 --> 08:42.534
- Just stay calm!
- My leg's killing me, Greg. Hurry up, all right?

08:45.457 --> 08:47.561
- Hey, hey!
- Damn it!

08:47.633 --> 08:51.308
- Wait a minute. Wait in here.
- Hey, Greg! Where you going?

08:51.374 --> 08:53.860
Damn it!

08:53.933 --> 08:57.128
- 15th Squad to Central K.
- Son of a bitch!

08:57.196 --> 08:59.170
1085 forthwith- Where the hell am I?

08:59.244 --> 09:02.624
- I don't even know what street I'm on. What street am I on?
- There we go. I got it.

09:02.698 --> 09:06.590
- I'm calling for another unit.
- No, no. We'll be there in two minutes.

09:06.665 --> 09:09.532
Disregard that, Central.
Have them standing by at the hospital.

09:09.606 --> 09:11.515
- Come on!
- You're gonna be okay, James.

09:11.589 --> 09:13.694
All I want is a fightin' chance.

09:36.634 --> 09:38.543
Come on, Greg.

09:44.411 --> 09:47.410
- Come on, Greg. Back it up.
- Wait a minute. I'll back it up.

09:48.601 --> 09:50.576
- Oh!
- Hey!

09:50.648 --> 09:52.818
- What are you doing?
- Oh, Greg!

09:54.198 --> 09:56.686
- I don't want to die, Greg.
- Come on, partner. We made it.

09:56.758 --> 09:59.887
- We're here.
- Don't call my dad, Greg. Don't call him, all right?

09:59.957 --> 10:02.126
Help! There's a man shot!

10:02.195 --> 10:04.398
Come on! Help! Help!

10:04.466 --> 10:07.432
Down here! Down here! Let's go! Let's go!

10:07.505 --> 10:09.925
- We're gonna lie you down, okay?
- Easy, easy, easy, easy!

10:10.000 --> 10:12.487
- Here you go.
- All right. Let's get that jacket off.

10:12.558 --> 10:14.946
- Get his jacket.
- Get an I.V. Running in each arm.

10:15.022 --> 10:18.282
- Okay, Detective. Where do you have pain?
- I got a hell of a backache.

10:18.349 --> 10:20.835
- How many times do you think you were hit?
- Once, I think.

10:20.907 --> 10:24.037
Here's the wound of entry-
left flank, just below the rib cage.

10:24.106 --> 10:28.447
Okay, we gotta look for an exit.
Detective, we're gonna roll you over, okay?

10:28.520 --> 10:31.933
- One, two, three.
- Aah!

10:32.006 --> 10:34.046
- How's it look, Doc?
- Wait out there, please.

10:34.118 --> 10:37.083
- He never lost consciousness. That's good, right?
- No exit wound.

10:37.157 --> 10:39.392
- Is that good?
- Let us do our job. Wait outside.

10:39.460 --> 10:41.369
- Should I give blood?
- Good. Give blood.

10:41.443 --> 10:43.351
- Sir, stand back.
- Does this hurt?

10:43.426 --> 10:45.597
- No.
- How about this?

10:45.665 --> 10:48.282
- No. Be careful with those scissors down there.
- We're at mid-thigh.

10:48.352 --> 10:50.653
- Don't get delusions of grandeur.
- B.P.'s 90 over 60.

10:50.719 --> 10:54.678
Okay. Put in the Foley. We're gonna
catheterize your bladder and look for bleeding.

10:54.749 --> 10:56.723
- Okay, Detective?
- Okay.

10:56.795 --> 10:58.900
- Haah! Aah!
- What's happening? Is he okay?

10:58.971 --> 11:01.871
- You gotta wait outside. Please, get him out.
- What's goin' on?

11:04.409 --> 11:08.150
- We need a further description on these two black males.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

11:08.215 --> 11:10.636
Both of them were over six-foot tall.

11:10.711 --> 11:14.506
Um, the shooter, he was more
dark-complected than the other one.

11:14.580 --> 11:17.895
- He was wearing a- a blue T-shirt and jeans.
- Mm-hmm.

11:17.971 --> 11:23.664
The other one had a, um, a yellow and black
and white check shirt on and tan pants.

11:23.729 --> 11:25.996
- Got it.
- Can you safeguard this for me, Sergeant?

11:26.063 --> 11:27.972
- Yeah, sure thing.
- Thanks.

11:28.047 --> 11:31.144
- No blood in the urine. You want to get set up for a D.P. L?
- No. Get a CAT scan right away.

11:31.214 --> 11:33.286
In your opinion,
you think I'm gonna live?

11:33.356 --> 11:37.283
You're looking real good so far. We need to
locate the bullet, then we're gonna go from there.

11:37.354 --> 11:39.328
Do me a favor.
I don't want my name released, Doc.

11:39.403 --> 11:43.197
I don't want my next of kin notified
till I know what's happening. All right?

11:43.273 --> 11:46.206
Fine. You're gonna be okay.
It'll be okay.

11:48.230 --> 11:52.735
First I think it's a straight-out robbery,
you know?

11:52.804 --> 11:56.926
Then your men come in,
and this pendejo pulls a badge out.

11:56.994 --> 11:59.098
How much money did they get?

11:59.169 --> 12:03.258
- I don't know exactly.
- You don't- How much?

12:03.328 --> 12:05.913
- Around 3,000.
- Three thousand dollars?

12:05.982 --> 12:09.909
Early morning, you're not even open for business.
What's up here, Mr. Hernandez?

12:09.980 --> 12:13.493
- Up" how?
- Up' how?" Look, we want to know who shot our friend.

12:13.563 --> 12:18.231
Was this involved in bookmaking or drugs
or numbers? You better not hold back on this, pal!

12:18.298 --> 12:20.565
Guys, neighbors saw one of the perps
climb in a Dumpster...

12:20.632 --> 12:23.119
- around the corner.
- You stay right here.

12:26.646 --> 12:28.749
Over here!

12:28.821 --> 12:31.187
Police! You do what I say!
You understand me?

12:31.251 --> 12:35.211
- Answer up loud and clear, or we start shooting!
- Don't shoot! I hear you!

12:35.282 --> 12:38.031
- Stick your hands up in the air right now!
- I've been shot!

12:38.098 --> 12:40.518
Come on! Let me see your hands!
Get 'em up! Now stand up!

12:40.592 --> 12:42.501
- Diane?
- Got him.

12:42.575 --> 12:45.869
I'm shot! I need a doctor!

12:47.277 --> 12:49.349
- Where's your gun?
- Oh, I need a doctor!

12:49.420 --> 12:51.874
- One gun!
- Got ammo here.

12:51.947 --> 12:54.215
I got the money.
Who's your partner?

12:54.282 --> 12:58.819
- I want a name and address now!
- Come on, man. I feel like I'm dying, man. Please!

12:58.888 --> 13:00.895
Listen to me!
I don't want to hear another word...

13:00.967 --> 13:03.487
about how you feel
or what you need, all right?

13:03.558 --> 13:06.905
Nobody's gonna help you now, slick, huh?
So you better give up a name...

13:06.981 --> 13:10.427
- or you will die right here, understand?
- Bobby! Andy!

13:10.500 --> 13:13.400
You better take this somewhere else.

13:14.977 --> 13:17.431
Come on. Let's go for a ride.

13:31.098 --> 13:33.040
The guy's shield, it looked legit.

13:33.114 --> 13:36.014
- We'll figure it out, Greg.
- We thought he was on a job.

13:36.088 --> 13:38.836
- Detective?
- Hey, there. How's he doin'?

13:38.904 --> 13:42.033
James is stable.
He's going to the intensive care unit.

13:42.101 --> 13:44.206
The bullet is buried in
the heavy muscle of his back...

13:44.277 --> 13:46.545
so we'd rather not go in
and try to cut it out.

13:46.612 --> 13:48.880
- You're gonna leave the bullet in?
- The bullet's not the problem.

13:48.947 --> 13:51.019
It bounced off the second lumbar vertebrae
and chipped it.

13:51.090 --> 13:53.161
James is feeling a little
numbness in his left leg...

13:53.233 --> 13:55.371
so we're gonna watch for any
progression ofloss of feeling.

13:55.440 --> 13:58.156
Give us a minute to set him up in his room,
then you guys can go and see him.

13:58.223 --> 14:00.131
- Thank you.
- Oh, man.

14:00.206 --> 14:02.115
Don't worry, Greg.

14:04.492 --> 14:07.840
Detective Medavoy.

14:07.915 --> 14:11.939
- Oh, hey, there-John, right? - I was so
stunned. I heard what happened. Are you okay?

14:12.009 --> 14:13.918
Yeah, I'm fine.

14:13.992 --> 14:16.926
- Hi, John.
- Hi. Any word on Detective Martinez?

14:16.999 --> 14:19.845
Not yet.
They got him in intensive care.

14:19.910 --> 14:23.073
Uh, fortunately, uh,
there's plenty of blood around...

14:23.141 --> 14:25.692
you know, if it's needed.

14:25.763 --> 14:28.665
So if you were thinking of
coming maybe down here to...

14:28.738 --> 14:31.704
you know, give blood,
I wouldn't worry about it.

14:31.776 --> 14:36.248
Uh, Detective, on the side of caution,
I don't give blood...

14:36.319 --> 14:40.310
even though I'm in a monogamous relationship,
and I get tested every three months.

14:40.381 --> 14:43.445
I didn't mean any offense.
I just meant-Well, you know.

14:43.515 --> 14:45.903
Uh...

14:47.258 --> 14:50.639
Could you... give this
to Detective Martinez...

14:50.713 --> 14:52.784
or just put it in his room?

14:52.856 --> 14:55.221
I've had it since I was a kid.

14:55.286 --> 14:59.027
Whatever positive energy it has, I figured
Detective Martinez could use more than me.

14:59.093 --> 15:01.710
Oh, yeah, sure. Absolutely.

15:01.780 --> 15:05.040
I'll get this to him. Thanks, John.

15:06.578 --> 15:11.017
I need a doctor!

15:11.088 --> 15:15.309
- Get this thing out of me!
- We got the shooter-Antonio Vargas.

15:15.374 --> 15:18.820
He just gave it up in the car.
Greg, can you I.D. This scumbag here?

15:18.893 --> 15:22.503
Yeah. Yeah, that's him.
I bet you that's my bullet in his ass too, huh?

15:22.572 --> 15:27.425
- That's enough. Come on. He's the one that showed the shield?
- No, we haven't got that guy yet.

15:27.496 --> 15:29.830
But this one had a nine-millimeter
with him at the scene, right?

15:29.896 --> 15:33.539
- How's James doing?
- Possible spinal damage. It's up in the air.

15:33.606 --> 15:35.514
- Damn.
- So, it was a robbery?

15:35.589 --> 15:38.904
No. The bar was a numbers bank. Now,
the shooter's partner, he set up the whole play.

15:38.980 --> 15:42.044
This one said that he never met him until last night.
Only got him by his first name.

15:42.115 --> 15:44.416
- Nate.
- Yeah. One of his con, lowlife running buddies...

15:44.482 --> 15:47.415
tells him that this Nate is looking
for some backup on a robbery.

15:47.489 --> 15:51.164
So Antonio here goes to meet him
at the 79th Street Pool Hall, takes the job.

15:51.232 --> 15:53.140
- And that's all he knows, right?
- We're sure?

15:53.214 --> 15:55.799
Believe me, he gave up all he's got.

15:55.869 --> 15:58.934
- I ain't got no reason to dick y'all around, man.
- Shut up.

15:59.004 --> 16:02.069
Just get me a doctor!

16:02.139 --> 16:04.788
- What about the other guy's shield?
- Figure it's fake or stolen...

16:04.857 --> 16:06.766
something to use when he needs it.

16:06.839 --> 16:09.173
So this one could get the drop on us, huh?
I don't believe it.

16:09.240 --> 16:11.889
We grabbed this one with all the money.
This guy, Nate...

16:11.958 --> 16:14.161
is supposed to call him on his beeper.

16:14.229 --> 16:16.562
- That was the plan if they got separated.
- He hasn't beeped him yet?

16:16.629 --> 16:19.278
- No, we gotta wait on that.
- I want him to call that guy back as soon as he beeps.

16:19.347 --> 16:23.601
Hey, here comes a doctor. Get him in there.
- Come on, Antonio. Come here.

16:23.665 --> 16:26.151
- Hey, Doc.
- Here, I'll take you to seeJames.

16:26.224 --> 16:28.079
Is that you?

16:28.144 --> 16:31.590
- No, it's not me. Come on. This way.
- Show us where he is.

16:33.964 --> 16:35.873
Let's find a pay phone.

16:38.667 --> 16:42.342
I want you to listen up. Don't you say
anything that might tip this guy off.

16:42.409 --> 16:45.474
- Better do this right.
- Look, man, I can hardly think straight.

16:45.544 --> 16:50.593
Well, you think about this: You screw this up,
and we all get back in the car. All right?

16:50.661 --> 16:54.435
- Just take a deep breath.
- Do it right.

16:56.068 --> 16:58.238
Yo, Nate.

16:58.306 --> 17:01.600
Yeah, I'm good. I'm straight.
Where you at?

17:01.665 --> 17:06.420
Ah, a pay phone. I don't know.
Outside some pizza place.

17:06.494 --> 17:10.748
Where you at? You want me to come up
there so we can whack this money up?

17:10.813 --> 17:14.489
Yeah. All right.

17:14.556 --> 17:17.653
I can do that in 20 minutes. Yeah.

17:17.722 --> 17:20.656
All right. Later.

17:20.728 --> 17:22.997
Very good.

17:23.064 --> 17:27.285
He's at the 79th Street Pool Hall.
Y'all gonna take me to that doctor now, right?

17:27.348 --> 17:29.738
- We need Martinez to I.D. Him.
- The other one I.D.'d me already!

17:29.814 --> 17:32.845
We need both of them to I.D. You, asshole.
We're not takin' no chances.

17:32.916 --> 17:37.518
No, no, I confessed already. I did it!
I shot that cop! Where'd that doctor go?

17:37.586 --> 17:40.585
Come on, man! I've been shot!
Get me that doctor!

17:40.657 --> 17:44.004
Oh, it's burning, man! Uuh!

17:44.079 --> 17:47.623
- How are you feeling, James? - I'm down
but not out. - It's good to see you, James.

17:47.694 --> 17:49.352
- Yeah, likewise.
- This piece of crap look familiar?

17:49.420 --> 17:52.354
Yeah, you got him. That's the shooter.
What about the other guy?

17:52.428 --> 17:54.565
Yeah, we're gonna
grab him up right now.

17:54.634 --> 17:56.161
- Who's this?
- He's all yours, Doc.

17:56.234 --> 17:58.567
- You want to remove the handcuffs?
- We'll get 'em off in a minute.

17:58.633 --> 18:01.479
Here. Fellas, want to help the doctor
with this guy? And stay with him.

18:01.543 --> 18:05.502
- Get well soon, pal.
- I was aiming for your monkey ass!

18:05.574 --> 18:08.094
We'll be back to see you later, all right?
Chin up, man.

18:08.164 --> 18:11.611
- You're looking good.
- Just got this weird feeling in my leg though.

18:11.683 --> 18:14.814
Listen, when the nurse comes by,
give her a little tickle on the ass.

18:14.881 --> 18:16.790
They love it when you do that.

18:19.072 --> 18:23.826
Man. The one day that I have my.38
instead of my nine-millimeter.

18:23.902 --> 18:26.999
I mean, if I don't have to reload,
that scumbag is dead.

18:27.069 --> 18:31.060
- You got him at least though.
- You should see all the cops that came down here, James.

18:31.130 --> 18:34.424
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Bosses too. I bet the mayor comes by to see you.

18:34.489 --> 18:37.335
- Yeah, I'm a real role model, huh?
- Yeah.

18:37.400 --> 18:39.821
Oh, geez, I almost forgot.

18:39.896 --> 18:42.960
- Uh, John wanted you to have this.
- John Kelly?

18:43.030 --> 18:47.568
- Naw, upstairs John," the gay guy- for good luck.
- Oh, yeah?

18:47.636 --> 18:49.774
I didn't know he cared.

18:49.843 --> 18:51.915
James, hi, I'm Dr. Kressell.

18:51.986 --> 18:55.052
I'll be stopping in over the next few days
to do some quick checks on you.

18:55.120 --> 18:58.153
Do me a favor and describe for me
the sensation in your left leg.

18:58.224 --> 19:01.702
It's the damnedest thing, Doc. There's a zone
around here where I don't feel anything...

19:01.775 --> 19:05.068
and then right around it
it's like pins and needles.

19:05.133 --> 19:07.041
- It's hard to explain.
- All right.

19:07.116 --> 19:09.929
- Uh, let me see you wiggle your toes, okay?
- Oh!

19:14.153 --> 19:17.729
Is that full mobility? I mean, I can't tell.
Does that look like full mobility?

19:17.798 --> 19:20.580
That's good. It's good.
No problem with the right leg?

19:20.645 --> 19:22.914
No, I- I don't think...

19:22.981 --> 19:24.923
- I don't know though.
- All right, all right.

19:24.996 --> 19:27.232
We're gonna do
a series of pin pricks...

19:27.299 --> 19:30.646
and I want you to tell me if you feel any of them.

19:33.249 --> 19:36.662
Yeah. Yeah.

19:36.736 --> 19:42.135
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

19:42.205 --> 19:45.618
- Martinez, he's a tough kid.
- Yeah, he is.

19:45.691 --> 19:48.789
You don't figure this Nate guy
got wise and took off, do you?

19:48.858 --> 19:50.929
I think our guy sold it pretty good.

19:51.001 --> 19:56.182
Look, God willing, Martinez don't take a turn
for the worse, we snatch this guy up...

19:56.247 --> 19:58.766
- You want to have supper tonight?
- Yeah, sure. Thanks.

19:58.838 --> 20:02.152
- I was thinking maybe you and Russell come over.
- Me and Russell?

20:02.228 --> 20:06.351
Yeah. She's been doing good work
on the squad the last few months.

20:06.419 --> 20:08.328
- Uh-huh.
- You disagree?

20:08.402 --> 20:12.263
- No.
- You know she's been going to meetings?

20:12.336 --> 20:14.474
No, I didn't.

20:14.543 --> 20:17.575
You know, she said she wanted some time,
she needed some space.

20:17.645 --> 20:21.800
I didn't want to talk to her about that.
So you been helpin' her out, Andy?

20:21.868 --> 20:25.445
I talk to her somewhat, regards to the drinking.
You're supposed to do that.

20:25.515 --> 20:27.685
- Uh-huh.
- So what do you think about, uh, the dinner?

20:27.753 --> 20:30.817
Um, yeah. Yeah, I'd like to come.

20:30.888 --> 20:34.302
Talk with Russell.
You work out the transportation.

20:46.178 --> 20:50.038
Police! Everybody put your hands on the tables.
Hands flat on the table! Back door!

20:50.112 --> 20:53.755
- Show me some I.D.
- You too! Bobby.

20:53.822 --> 20:56.668
Drop the stick, turn around,
put your hands flat on the table.

20:56.733 --> 20:59.993
Listen, guys, I'm on the job here, all right?
What's with you?

21:00.060 --> 21:03.441
- I'm on the job here. Check my I.D.
- Shut your mouth!

21:03.514 --> 21:06.361
- He's got balls, I'll give him that.
- Nathan Stackhouse."

21:06.425 --> 21:10.286
- Is this for real, man?
- Corrections officer?

21:10.359 --> 21:13.654
- I want to make a phone call.
- You work for Corrections?

21:13.718 --> 21:17.971
That's right.
I work for Corrections. Hey! Aah!

21:18.036 --> 21:20.272
You want to stop twisting my arm now?

21:33.773 --> 21:36.326
Guard for 12 years at Rikers.

21:36.396 --> 21:41.096
- Twelve years.
- Great job to look for guys to help you with stickups.

21:41.162 --> 21:46.823
- I've got nothing to say until the D.A. Gets here.
- Right- his buddy, the D.A.

21:46.887 --> 21:49.570
You all can quit wasting
your time and your effort.

21:49.639 --> 21:53.249
Prison guard,
noise like a subway station...

21:53.317 --> 21:55.836
inmates flinging their crap
off the upper tiers.

21:55.908 --> 21:58.776
This guy probably looks the other way.
He don't want no confrontation.

21:58.851 --> 22:03.104
Kisses up to the skells, so if there's a breakout
he don't get took hostage.

22:03.169 --> 22:07.575
You know, you wouldn't last half a day
either side of the bars, bitch.

22:09.278 --> 22:12.125
Take this.

22:12.189 --> 22:15.156
Step out, guys.
The D.A. 's taking over.

22:19.482 --> 22:21.586
How's this guy hooked up with you?

22:21.657 --> 22:23.827
Would you wait in the squad room,
please, Detective?

22:36.115 --> 22:38.764
That's right, ma'am.

22:38.834 --> 22:42.182
What the hell has this
Stackhouse got going?

22:42.256 --> 22:44.524
Whatever it was,
Abrams isn't giving it up to me.

22:44.592 --> 22:47.459
I know this guy who was in there with Abrams.
He used to be a guard himself.

22:47.534 --> 22:50.053
- Would he talk to you?
- Yeah. I think he's with the inspector general's office.

22:50.124 --> 22:52.905
- That's the Department of Corrections.
- I'm telling you...

22:52.971 --> 22:55.109
whatever play this hump is making, Martinez
better not get moved down to second place.

22:55.179 --> 22:57.479
Okay. Let me know.

23:01.224 --> 23:04.419
- See how James is doing.
- That's who I'm calling.

23:06.631 --> 23:09.182
Can I talk to you for a minute?

23:09.253 --> 23:12.121
Hi. Yeah, I'm trying to check
the status of a patient.

23:14.147 --> 23:17.441
Um-
Listen, forget about talking to Bobby.

23:17.505 --> 23:20.438
- Just forget about it till this whole thing is over.
- I talked to him.

23:20.512 --> 23:22.966
- You talked to him?
- Yeah, I invited him for dinner.

23:23.039 --> 23:26.333
- What did he say?
- He said it was a good idea.

23:27.869 --> 23:29.755
- Does he know I'm gonna be there?
- Yeah.

23:29.819 --> 23:31.924
- And he said, It sounds good"?
- In those words.

23:31.995 --> 23:36.500
What did you tell him? Did you tell him I was
going to A.A. Meetings? How did he react?

23:36.569 --> 23:39.503
You want me to describe
his breathing pattern?

23:39.576 --> 23:43.436
Yeah. Changes in his body temperature.
This is what I need to know, Andy. Come on.

23:50.036 --> 23:51.944
- Easy does it.
- Mm-hmm. I know.

23:52.018 --> 23:57.384
Get back to me quick. We can finish this up
by the end of the day. Okay, okay.

23:59.248 --> 24:02.662
Inspector, this is need-to-know.
I don't think the detectives should be here.

24:03.838 --> 24:06.456
- They're the arresting officers.
- Then they should stay. All right?

24:09.277 --> 24:11.065
We're making Stackhouse a witness.

24:11.131 --> 24:13.236
- You're making him a witness?
- He'll testify against the shooter.

24:13.307 --> 24:15.924
- This guy's gotta do time.
- No time. He's a material witness.

24:15.994 --> 24:17.903
You've got two detectives
for witnesses.

24:17.977 --> 24:21.237
The shooter's who we need to convict.
He's the one I'm worrying about.

24:21.303 --> 24:24.019
No, I want some answers. Stackhouse knew
the fix was in since we picked him up.

24:24.086 --> 24:27.696
You watch your language, Detective.
No one is fixing anything.

24:27.764 --> 24:30.829
No? James Martinez is Iying in
a hospital bed with a bullet in him...

24:30.899 --> 24:33.386
and you're dressing up
this scumbag for a walk.

24:33.458 --> 24:36.327
Have you thought through what
this is gonna do to cop morale?

24:39.888 --> 24:42.952
Officer Stackhouse is a crucial informant
on a series of cases...

24:43.022 --> 24:47.177
- that'll blow the roof off the Corrections Department.
- Blow the roof off"? Jiminy!

24:47.245 --> 24:50.920
It's easier to get high on Rikers
than a Harlem street corner.

24:50.987 --> 24:52.841
Corruption is so rampant,
it's putting the good C.O. 's at risk.

24:52.906 --> 24:55.327
Stackhouse is our shot
at cleaning that up.

24:55.400 --> 24:58.215
- You have got a cop who is shot here.
- Believe me...

24:58.280 --> 25:01.093
if Stackhouse was the shooter,
this other thing goes to second position.

25:01.158 --> 25:05.434
But we got the shooter,
and my office has eight months in this guy.

25:05.509 --> 25:09.598
I know he's trouble, but he's got a setup,
and we're just not ready to move.

25:09.667 --> 25:13.976
He set up Martinez and Medavoy to get shot.
He used his shield to get 'em to drop their guard.

25:14.049 --> 25:16.798
He's gotta be at work in two hours.

25:29.146 --> 25:32.941
He tried to get two cops killed,
and now he's gonna go put on a uniform.

25:33.016 --> 25:36.113
It's wrong, man.
You can't get more wrong than this.

25:37.656 --> 25:39.759
Where are they taking him, Lieu?

25:39.830 --> 25:43.690
- Why don't you step in my office, Greg?
- How come he's not in handcuffs?

25:43.765 --> 25:45.837
Just come talk to me.

25:51.633 --> 25:54.534
Hey, it's, uh, Hampton, right?

25:54.608 --> 25:58.567
- Bernie Hampton, I.G.'s office at Corrections. Bobby Simone?
- Yeah, good to see you again.

25:58.638 --> 26:01.451
- I was with the P.C.'s. This is my partner, Andy Sipowicz.
- How you doin'?

26:01.516 --> 26:06.086
- This Stackhouse is helping you guys clean up Rikers?
- Yeah, right.

26:06.155 --> 26:08.063
This is making me sick.

26:09.865 --> 26:11.970
Yeah, huh? Come on over here.

26:17.030 --> 26:20.160
All right, look.
I gotta tell you off the record:

26:20.229 --> 26:24.221
Have somebody sit on Nate Stackhouse,
and don't let him out of your sight.

26:24.291 --> 26:27.585
- Why?
- He's got relatives in Barbados or Trinidad or some damn place.

26:27.650 --> 26:31.031
It wouldn't surprise me if the guy
jumps on a plane the first chance he gets.

26:31.104 --> 26:33.275
- What about this corruption case?
- Stackhouse has been...

26:33.343 --> 26:35.252
jerking this D.A. Around
for eight months.

26:35.327 --> 26:39.067
- He hasn't produced one damn thing.
- Abrams is calling it a big deal.

26:39.133 --> 26:42.000
Abrams needs to come back to reality.

26:42.075 --> 26:45.335
He is hoping and praying that this
investigation turns into something.

26:45.402 --> 26:47.506
But he never should've
done business with this bum.

26:47.577 --> 26:51.188
I know Stackhouse.
I worked on a tier with him 10 years ago.

26:51.256 --> 26:54.385
He was a malingerer then.
And now stickups.

26:54.455 --> 26:56.460
I knew there was something
this prick was up to.

26:56.533 --> 26:58.442
And you think he might disappear now?

26:58.517 --> 27:00.655
He's burning his candle
at five different ends, so, yeah.

27:00.724 --> 27:05.228
Maybe he's got sense enough
to know that his luck is running out.

27:06.673 --> 27:09.290
Look, I'm just telling you:

27:09.360 --> 27:12.457
Sit on this guy,
'cause he might be gone.

27:12.527 --> 27:15.307
- We appreciate this, man.
- Yeah. Hey, take it easy.

27:15.374 --> 27:17.893
Mm-hmm.

27:17.964 --> 27:20.168
I knew Abrams was full of crap.

27:21.131 --> 27:23.040
Hmm.

27:23.115 --> 27:27.007
- You believe in the people's right to know?
- Not generally, no.

27:27.081 --> 27:29.534
How else do you put pressure
on a guy like Abrams?

27:34.982 --> 27:37.882
Benita?

27:37.956 --> 27:41.915
Yeah, it's Bobby Simone.
You on a deadline?

27:45.985 --> 27:48.733
If you want me to, I can tell your parents
in person what happened.

27:48.799 --> 27:52.660
- I can bring 'em down here.
- No, not till I'm sure what my status is.

27:52.734 --> 27:55.121
You gotta tell 'em
at some point, James.

27:55.196 --> 27:58.391
Right, so I don't want them worrying on spec.
They're gonna be worrying enough already.

27:58.459 --> 28:01.208
God knows what my dad's gonna say.
He's already on me like, uh...

28:01.273 --> 28:04.568
I should be getting married,
have kids, a life outside the job.

28:04.632 --> 28:07.664
- My family's that way with me.
- You just gotta find the right person.

28:07.735 --> 28:09.589
Yeah.

28:09.654 --> 28:11.923
You ever think about kids?

28:11.989 --> 28:14.192
Not really.

28:14.261 --> 28:16.779
You know, I think I'd make
halfway decent father.

28:16.852 --> 28:19.185
I mean, if I wasn't
partially paralyzed or anything.

28:19.251 --> 28:22.565
Can you believe that second guy
turned out a correction officer?

28:22.641 --> 28:26.022
- Yeah, how about that?
- Hey there.

28:26.096 --> 28:28.004
- Hey, Doc.
- How you feeling?

28:28.078 --> 28:30.696
- I don't know.
- Should I go?

28:30.765 --> 28:33.066
- No, no. Don't go.
- Well, just in case the squad needs me.

28:33.132 --> 28:35.203
Okay, but not on my account.

28:36.523 --> 28:38.977
Okay. Feel that?

28:39.050 --> 28:40.959
No.

28:41.034 --> 28:43.269
- Feel this?
- No, I don't. Doc, it's been six hours.

28:43.336 --> 28:46.084
If it's gonna come back,
shouldn't it have come back already?

28:46.150 --> 28:48.386
Just a minute, James. Feel that?

28:48.454 --> 28:50.722
Yeah, I felt that one.

28:50.789 --> 28:53.406
The hypesthesia isn't progressing,
which is good.

28:53.475 --> 28:56.321
- I'll come back in about-about an hour, okay?
- Okay, Doc.

28:57.794 --> 28:59.703
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

28:59.777 --> 29:01.849
Dr. Venner.

29:01.920 --> 29:04.057
- You need to be gettin' back?
- I don't think.

29:04.126 --> 29:06.035
I think they got things under control.

29:18.297 --> 29:22.070
- Hey, how's James Martinez?
- Possible spinal injury from the bullet.

29:22.135 --> 29:26.868
Your boss is looking to make a material witness
from one of those scumbags got him shot.

29:26.934 --> 29:31.056
- What's the guy got for him?
- Some crap about corrupt prison guards.

29:31.124 --> 29:33.741
Maybe it's a good case.
Abrams is a decent guy.

29:33.811 --> 29:37.835
Maybe he's a decent guy
looking for a promotion.

29:37.905 --> 29:40.686
- I got your voice mail about dinner with Bobby.
- How does that sound?

29:40.751 --> 29:44.099
Well, I wish that you had asked me first.
I'm up to my neck in work.

29:44.174 --> 29:46.279
Yeah, I was figuring
I'd pick up some carryout.

29:46.349 --> 29:48.257
Andy, maybe it's not about me cooking.

29:48.332 --> 29:52.553
- Maybe I just might not be in the mood to have people over.
- Sure. Okay.

29:52.618 --> 29:56.359
- I'm sorry.
- No problem. We'll do it another night.

29:56.425 --> 29:59.042
I gotta go.

29:59.112 --> 30:01.380
Sylvia, is something the matter?

30:01.448 --> 30:04.479
I just got some things up in the air.

30:04.550 --> 30:06.458
I'll see you later.

30:16.704 --> 30:19.005
- Hey.
- Hi.

30:19.072 --> 30:22.900
- Andy mentioned dinner.
- Yeah, he was talking about that.

30:24.284 --> 30:27.001
He, um, told me that you've
been going to these meetings?

30:27.068 --> 30:30.809
Mm-hmm. They're going pretty well.

30:30.874 --> 30:34.386
I, um...

30:34.457 --> 30:37.936
- I had to get it straight in my own head first.
- Yeah, sure.

30:39.798 --> 30:42.830
You figure it's okay then,
us testing the waters?

30:42.901 --> 30:46.161
- Yeah.
- That's good.

30:49.138 --> 30:52.715
15th. Yeah.

30:52.785 --> 30:57.191
- Detective Simone, Benita Alden is waiting downstairs.
- Thanks.

31:12.936 --> 31:15.302
- Bobby.
- Hi, Benita. Thanks for coming.

31:15.367 --> 31:18.847
A man I never thought
I'd hear from again.

31:18.918 --> 31:23.520
Listen, I can put you out in front
on that shot cop.

31:23.588 --> 31:27.099
First of all, I'm not on that story.
I'm working the courts now.

31:27.170 --> 31:32.056
And second, we need to talk through what
we didn't talk through eight months ago.

31:32.128 --> 31:34.615
No, we don't.

31:34.687 --> 31:37.141
Then we don't have
anything else to talk about.

31:42.140 --> 31:46.067
Benita, you took information
that I shared with you in bed...

31:46.139 --> 31:48.625
and you passed it along
to another reporter.

31:48.697 --> 31:51.031
You think that I did that?
That I crossed that line that one time?

31:51.096 --> 31:54.956
You know, I would hope that you'd believe
that I did it out of dedication to my work.

31:55.030 --> 31:58.292
Haven't you ever crossed the line
out of dedication to your work, Bobby?

31:59.892 --> 32:02.412
Look, I don't want to go
over all this, all right?

32:02.483 --> 32:07.369
Geez, if you knew how crazy I was for you,
you would've forgiven me.

32:07.441 --> 32:11.979
- You want to hear about this cop?
- Why are you telling me?

32:12.048 --> 32:15.080
We collared these two perps, and the D.A.
Just cut a sweetheart deal with one of them.

32:15.150 --> 32:17.450
- Roy Abrams signed off on that?
- Roy Abrams drew it up.

32:17.516 --> 32:20.363
Listen, you gotta get to Abrams,
Benita, you know.

32:20.428 --> 32:23.045
- Call him before the end of the day.
- Who's the cop?

32:23.115 --> 32:27.369
- The next of kin hasn't been notified yet.
- Is he gonna die?

32:27.433 --> 32:31.228
No. Look, Benita, the cop's not the story here.
You gotta get to Abrams.

32:31.303 --> 32:35.163
Yeah, I've got his beeper number.
Wait a second. Why-Why are you giving me this?

32:35.236 --> 32:37.407
Why? Because I think that it's
an important thing that needs to be told...

32:37.476 --> 32:39.712
and I know that you're good enough
to nail it and tell it right.

32:39.780 --> 32:42.081
Is that the only reason?

32:42.147 --> 32:45.975
I just thought that here's a thing
where both of our interests coincide.

32:51.231 --> 32:54.360
This guy right here,
he's with the Corrections Department.

32:54.429 --> 32:56.337
Call him.

32:56.413 --> 32:59.161
Tell him you talked to me.

32:59.227 --> 33:01.136
Yeah.

33:27.695 --> 33:29.964
- Hi.
- Hey, Donna.

33:30.030 --> 33:33.161
I guess no recent news on James.
I called five minutes ago.

33:33.229 --> 33:35.813
Yeah, I think he's
out of harm's way now.

33:35.884 --> 33:37.793
Everything is so...

33:39.434 --> 33:41.538
impermanent.

33:41.609 --> 33:43.397
Hmm.

33:45.480 --> 33:49.569
- May I ask you a question?
- Sure.

33:49.637 --> 33:53.858
If I am 100% out of line,
I apologize beforehand.

33:53.924 --> 33:59.388
But I have been thinking about this
for so many months, and I was just thinking...

33:59.457 --> 34:04.344
something could happen,
and I would've never gotten it said.

34:04.416 --> 34:06.587
What is it, Donna?

34:08.414 --> 34:11.411
Would you be interested
in seeing me socially?

34:11.485 --> 34:13.972
- Whoa!
- Oh!

34:14.043 --> 34:17.391
- I just dove off the deep end.
- No, n...

34:17.465 --> 34:19.701
I'm, um...

34:19.768 --> 34:22.801
I'm interested in somebody, Donna.

34:22.871 --> 34:25.074
I see.

34:25.141 --> 34:28.370
I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable.

34:28.437 --> 34:32.264
Not at all.
I'm very flattered that you would be interested.

34:32.339 --> 34:34.989
I'd hope you'd keep me posted
if your situation changed.

34:37.329 --> 34:40.110
I'm not expecting any changes, Donna.

34:42.543 --> 34:44.964
I understand.

34:45.038 --> 34:47.402
- Hey.
- Hi.

34:47.469 --> 34:50.021
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

34:50.092 --> 34:51.946
Um, how'd it go with the reporter?

34:52.011 --> 34:56.166
Good. It went good. You know, uh,
I just had to talk to her about something.

34:56.234 --> 34:58.306
- Look, uh...
- Oh, yeah?

34:58.376 --> 35:01.158
Tonight turns out to be
not good for Sylvia.

35:01.224 --> 35:03.557
- Oh, okay.
- She's all piled under with work.

35:03.622 --> 35:06.010
- Sure. No problem, Andy.
- We'll do it another time, huh?

35:06.085 --> 35:09.313
Sure. Good night.

35:09.379 --> 35:12.096
- Well-
- Hmm.

35:12.163 --> 35:16.383
- I gotta have dinner anyways.
- You know, me too.

35:24.830 --> 35:27.001
- So are you gonna seeJames?
- Yeah, in a bit.

35:27.068 --> 35:29.239
- I want to report a backstabbing.
- What?

35:29.308 --> 35:32.786
A newspaper reporter calls and wants
to know why I'm giving a free pass...

35:32.858 --> 35:36.719
to a cop shooter for the sake of a separate
investigation of the Corrections Department.

35:36.793 --> 35:39.060
You people didn't leave anything out.

35:39.127 --> 35:41.614
- It didn't come from this office.
- All right, Lieutenant.

35:41.686 --> 35:44.140
- You wanted Stackhouse charged? He's chargedattempted murder.
- You locked him up?

35:44.214 --> 35:46.863
Five thousand man-hours worth of
criminal investigation down the toilet.

35:46.932 --> 35:50.760
Well, maybe that's where it belonged.
See, I hear Stackhouse was playing you like a fish.

35:50.835 --> 35:53.200
Was it you, Detective?
Did you give it to her?

35:53.265 --> 35:56.134
Maury, you got the respect
of every cop in this city.

36:00.462 --> 36:04.323
- What do you hear about Martinez?
- I'm going to see him now.

36:04.396 --> 36:06.534
- Good night.
- Good night.

36:06.604 --> 36:11.587
I'm gonna go home, have two shots of scotch
and consider the bright vista of my career.

36:18.022 --> 36:22.493
This is not coming back. It's not coming back.
It's- I still got the numbness.

36:22.564 --> 36:24.735
James, don't you want
to call your parents?

36:24.804 --> 36:27.802
- I think it could help to have your family with you.
- No, I...

36:27.874 --> 36:31.386
I don't know how I'm gonna tell 'em this.
They already lost my brother.

36:31.457 --> 36:33.366
Everybody decent?

36:33.440 --> 36:35.349
- Hello.
- Hi, Greg.

36:35.424 --> 36:37.943
- How you doin'?
- What's cooking?

36:38.014 --> 36:42.387
Hah, you know, there's some back and forth
on one of the perps- nature of the charges.

36:42.460 --> 36:45.176
- It's not something you should worry about.
- Mm-hmm.

36:45.243 --> 36:49.464
- They said the other guy's gonna be okay, the other perp?
- Yeah, yeah. Hooray for him.

36:49.529 --> 36:53.717
- James, I'm gonna go home.
- Yeah, I guess Maurice is going crazy, huh?

36:53.784 --> 36:57.644
- I'll stop by in the morning. Okay?
- All right. Thanks, Adrianne.

36:57.718 --> 37:00.269
Yeah, I'm gonna have a good thought for you.
See you tomorrow.

37:00.340 --> 37:04.648
So long, Adrianne. So, huh?

37:04.724 --> 37:06.729
- Yeah.
- Heh-heh!

37:08.850 --> 37:13.288
- What, is the TVbusted?
- Yeah, said they're coming by to fix it.

37:13.359 --> 37:15.366
The feeling is not coming back, Greg.

37:15.438 --> 37:18.982
- No, huh?
- No. I'm afraid here.

37:19.053 --> 37:20.962
- I'm afraid I'm gonna wind up a cripple.
- Hey, hey.

37:21.036 --> 37:24.832
- They already lost my brother.
- Don't worry. You're good. You're gonna be good.

37:26.890 --> 37:29.376
Hey, how's it going in here?

37:29.448 --> 37:32.294
Okay, I guess, Doc.
Listen, I just wanted to say...

37:32.359 --> 37:34.398
I appreciate you
helping me out this morning.

37:34.471 --> 37:37.503
It's our pleasure, Detective.
You take care of us pretty good too.

37:37.573 --> 37:41.149
Actually, Doc,
James does have some concerns.

37:41.220 --> 37:43.487
- This isn't my neurologist, Greg.
- Yeah, well...

37:43.554 --> 37:45.856
What are your concerns, James?

37:45.921 --> 37:49.216
With my, uh,
feeling not being back, truthfully.

37:49.280 --> 37:51.253
When was your neurologist in last?

37:51.327 --> 37:53.976
- He's supposed to be by soon, I guess.
- Listen, James...

37:54.046 --> 37:57.144
I know you're worried, but I want you
to understand that after trauma...

37:57.212 --> 38:00.343
it is very hard to monitor
our own nervous sensations precisely.

38:00.411 --> 38:02.320
- So don't worry.
- Yeah.

38:02.395 --> 38:04.564
- Hi.
- All right. Here we go.

38:04.633 --> 38:06.639
- Hey, Doc.
- How you doing?

38:06.713 --> 38:09.199
Well, I'm concerned, naturally.
I'm getting more and more worried.

38:09.272 --> 38:13.296
- Okay, well, I tell you what. Let's do another test.
- Yeah, yeah.

38:21.139 --> 38:23.504
Whoa! L- I felt that one!

38:23.569 --> 38:26.634
- How about here?
- Yeah! Yeah, I felt that one too.

38:26.703 --> 38:29.037
Is that the area
I haven't felt anything in?

38:29.103 --> 38:31.785
- Yeah, that's the area.
- That's a positive sign, right, Doc?

38:31.854 --> 38:33.860
Yeah, it doesn't get
much more positive than that.

38:33.932 --> 38:36.452
- It's the green Jell-O. I keep telling people.
- Yeah!

38:36.524 --> 38:39.522
- I'll look in on you in the morning.
- Okay, Doc.

38:39.595 --> 38:42.276
- And I'll see you in about an hour.
- I look forward to it.

38:42.346 --> 38:45.484
- How about that, huh, James? Huh?
- Yeah.

38:45.550 --> 38:47.557
- Yeah.
- Hey, grab me the phone. I want to call my folks.

38:47.629 --> 38:49.603
- Yeah. Yeah, right. Now we're cooking, huh?
- Yeah.

38:49.677 --> 38:53.090
Here we go. What's the number?

38:53.163 --> 38:56.096
- It's 723-
- Okay, wait. Nine first.

39:06.533 --> 39:09.249
- Hey.
- Hi.

39:11.139 --> 39:14.880
I think I could probably throw something together
tomorrow night for Bobby and Diane.

39:14.946 --> 39:17.879
Just let it wait.

39:17.952 --> 39:20.570
I'm sorry, Andy.
I was just out of sorts.

39:20.639 --> 39:23.638
Don't worry about it.

39:23.710 --> 39:27.505
Maury Abrams told me you guys
really did a number on him.

39:27.580 --> 39:31.637
Abrams knew he was wrong.
What he was trying to do there?

39:31.706 --> 39:35.022
He knew that was wrong. Hi.

39:41.878 --> 39:44.364
Andy, I'm late.

39:44.437 --> 39:46.346
For what?

39:47.572 --> 39:49.840
I'm late. My period.

39:51.762 --> 39:53.671
You're late?

39:54.641 --> 39:57.193
How late are you?

39:57.264 --> 39:59.980
Two weeks.

40:00.047 --> 40:02.664
Two weeks, huh?

40:02.734 --> 40:05.515
That's late.

40:05.580 --> 40:07.489
That is.

40:09.066 --> 40:12.000
Geez, it was just that one incident...

40:12.074 --> 40:13.982
our country weekend.

40:17.351 --> 40:20.448
I think maybe I'll take a test.

40:20.517 --> 40:22.589
You gonna take it right now?

40:24.580 --> 40:26.489
Maybe in the morning.

40:27.779 --> 40:30.625
Wait till the morning maybe...

40:30.689 --> 40:32.598
probably.

41:01.524 --> 41:04.719
Yeah, this was about all you could do
if you didn't want to run with a gang.

41:04.787 --> 41:07.339
How'd you learn about 'em?

41:07.410 --> 41:10.311
I was, like, 13, and there was
this old fighter named Patsy Ferrara.

41:10.384 --> 41:14.060
He taught me about 'em.
There's a lot of tough guys that had birds.

41:16.590 --> 41:18.498
Go on.

41:22.507 --> 41:25.408
Every once in a while you realize
how beautiful they are.

41:35.973 --> 41:38.558
Yeah.

41:46.849 --> 41:49.466
I don't know. I can't figure anything
that Sylvia could've cooked...

41:49.537 --> 41:52.437
that would've turned out as good as this.

41:52.511 --> 41:54.517
I'm glad it happened.

41:56.989 --> 41:59.224
You know, Bobby, um...

41:59.292 --> 42:02.935
I'm still a kid being sober and clean.

42:03.002 --> 42:06.230
Yeah, well, I'm no
adulthood expert myself.

42:07.321 --> 42:09.905
You seem good, Diane, really.

42:09.975 --> 42:12.973
I mean, the last few months,
I- I watched you all the time.

42:13.045 --> 42:15.630
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

42:17.684 --> 42:20.399
I'm happy. I am... real happy now.

42:22.993 --> 42:27.530
That reporter that you, um-
That you sicced on Abrams.

42:27.599 --> 42:31.907
- Yeah?
- She didn't seem a hundred percent focused on business.

42:31.982 --> 42:35.624
- You observed all that just from being out there?
- I'm a detective, huh?

42:35.692 --> 42:38.506
- Huh!
- Waiting for an answer.

42:40.555 --> 42:42.626
We dated a few times.

42:44.105 --> 42:47.202
Is that why you gave her the story?

42:48.935 --> 42:52.643
She's a cutthroat.

42:52.709 --> 42:56.057
And I figured even if she did owe
somebody any favors in the D.A.'s office...

42:56.131 --> 42:58.683
she would've sold them out
in a heartbeat.

43:00.225 --> 43:02.297
So I've got a clear field here?

43:03.328 --> 43:05.368
All clear.

43:05.440 --> 43:07.349
You ready for me?

43:08.446 --> 43:11.740
Yeah, I'm ready.
