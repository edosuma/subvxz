WEBVTT

03:30.043 --> 03:31.476
Hey, boy!

03:31.543 --> 03:34.980
What you doing
with my mama's car?

03:41.253 --> 03:43.553
Wait there!

04:00.402 --> 04:02.270
Ain't you ashamed?

04:02.337 --> 04:05.939
You're trying to steal
an old lady's automobile.

04:06.007 --> 04:09.775
I been thinking
about buying me one.

04:09.843 --> 04:12.812
Bull. You ain't got
money for dinner,

04:12.879 --> 04:14.513
let alone buy no car.

04:14.580 --> 04:16.180
I'll tell you
something...

04:18.416 --> 04:21.319
I got enough money
for a Coca-Cola.

04:21.386 --> 04:23.353
Since it don't look

04:23.421 --> 04:25.322
like you're inviting
me inside...

04:25.389 --> 04:28.358
You'd steal the dining room
table if I did.

04:28.426 --> 04:31.828
You want to go
into town with me?

04:31.895 --> 04:33.696
I'm going to work
anyway.

04:33.763 --> 04:35.697
You're going
to work, huh?

04:35.764 --> 04:38.233
What kind
of work you do?

04:38.301 --> 04:40.335
None of your business.

04:40.402 --> 04:42.870
I bet you're
a movie star.

04:42.938 --> 04:44.504
A lady mechanic?

04:44.572 --> 04:45.840
No.

04:45.907 --> 04:47.341
A maid?

04:47.408 --> 04:49.843
What do you
think I am?

04:49.910 --> 04:51.510
A waitress.

04:56.916 --> 04:59.351
What line of work
you in...

04:59.418 --> 05:01.353
When you're not
stealing cars?

05:01.420 --> 05:05.389
Well, I'm looking for suitable
employment at the moment.

05:05.457 --> 05:08.391
Oh, yeah, but what
did you do before?

05:08.459 --> 05:10.026
I was, uh...

05:10.094 --> 05:11.862
I was
in state prison.

05:11.929 --> 05:13.363
State prison?

05:13.430 --> 05:15.030
Uh-huh.

05:16.432 --> 05:20.535
I guess some little
old lady wasn't so nice.

05:21.971 --> 05:24.038
It was
armed robbery.

05:27.442 --> 05:29.243
My, my.

05:30.444 --> 05:34.380
The things that turn up
in the street these days.

05:39.619 --> 05:41.586
Hey, what
you all do

05:41.653 --> 05:43.889
for a good time
around here?

05:43.956 --> 05:45.891
Listen to
the grass grow?

05:45.958 --> 05:48.592
I guess you had
a lot more fun

05:48.659 --> 05:50.427
up at state prison.

05:50.495 --> 05:52.396
See my right foot?

05:52.463 --> 05:54.931
I chopped two toes
off that foot

05:54.999 --> 05:56.632
with a ax.

05:56.700 --> 05:57.901
What? Why?

05:57.968 --> 06:00.668
To get off work detail.
You want to see it?

06:00.736 --> 06:02.271
No!

06:05.008 --> 06:08.910
I surely don't intend to stand
in the middle of main street

06:08.977 --> 06:11.678
and look
at your dirty feet.

06:19.986 --> 06:22.621
Boy, did you
really do that?

06:36.985 --> 06:39.085
What's it like?

06:41.021 --> 06:43.456
What you mean? Prison?

06:43.523 --> 06:47.392
No. Armed robbery.

06:53.999 --> 06:56.066
It ain't like
anything.

06:56.134 --> 06:58.368
Shoot!

06:58.435 --> 07:01.637
I knew you never robbed
no place, you faker.

07:11.880 --> 07:13.647
Ahem!

07:22.856 --> 07:24.124
Yeah.

07:27.027 --> 07:30.595
But you wouldn't have
the gumption to use it.

07:34.066 --> 07:35.633
All right.

07:39.070 --> 07:42.572
You just wait here
and keep your eyes open.

08:15.634 --> 08:17.968
Hey, what's
your name anyhow?

08:18.036 --> 08:20.071
Clyde barrow.

08:20.138 --> 08:23.306
Hi. I'm Bonnie Parker.
Pleased to meet you.

08:49.145 --> 08:50.112
Hey.

08:50.180 --> 08:52.081
Hey, slow down.

08:52.148 --> 08:53.548
Slow down.

08:53.616 --> 08:56.084
Take it easy.
You got my hat.

08:56.151 --> 08:58.052
Hey, cut it out.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.321
Cut it out!

09:08.129 --> 09:10.029
All right, now.

09:10.097 --> 09:12.899
I might as well
tell you right off.

09:12.966 --> 09:16.201
I ain't much
of a loverboy.

09:16.269 --> 09:19.604
I never saw
no percentage in it.

09:19.671 --> 09:22.106
Ain't nothin' wrong
with me--

09:22.173 --> 09:24.474
I don't like boys.

09:26.344 --> 09:28.077
Boy.

09:28.145 --> 09:29.678
Boy, boy.

09:29.746 --> 09:30.679
Huh?

09:30.747 --> 09:32.148
Boy what?

09:32.216 --> 09:34.116
Your advertising
is just dandy.

09:34.183 --> 09:35.650
Folks would never guess

09:35.718 --> 09:37.585
you don't have
a thing to sell.

09:39.289 --> 09:42.056
You better
take me home now.

09:42.124 --> 09:44.458
Don't you touch me!

09:47.261 --> 09:48.594
All right!

09:48.662 --> 09:51.597
If all you want's
a stud service,

09:51.665 --> 09:55.100
get back to west Dallas
and stay there forever.

09:55.168 --> 09:57.836
You're worth
a lot more than that,

09:57.904 --> 09:59.271
and you know it.

09:59.339 --> 10:02.606
You can find a loverboy
on every corner in town.

10:02.674 --> 10:05.609
It don't
make a damn to them

10:05.677 --> 10:07.644
whether you're
waiting on tables

10:07.711 --> 10:08.711
or picking cotton,

10:08.779 --> 10:11.648
but it does
make a damn to me!

10:11.715 --> 10:13.115
Why?

10:13.183 --> 10:15.151
Why? Because
you're different.

10:15.218 --> 10:16.652
You're like me.

10:16.719 --> 10:18.187
You want
different things.

10:18.255 --> 10:21.156
You got something better
than being a waitress.

10:21.223 --> 10:24.192
Traveling together,
we could cut a path

10:24.260 --> 10:27.161
clean across this state
and Kansas and Missouri.

10:27.228 --> 10:29.163
Everybody'd
know about it.

10:29.230 --> 10:31.698
Listen to me,
miss Bonnie Parker.

10:31.766 --> 10:33.632
How would you like

10:33.700 --> 10:36.169
to walk
into the dining room

10:36.236 --> 10:37.636
of the dolphis hotel

10:37.704 --> 10:39.171
wearing a silk dress?

10:39.238 --> 10:41.173
Would you like that?

10:41.240 --> 10:43.775
You got a right to that.

10:46.244 --> 10:48.045
Hey!

10:48.113 --> 10:51.148
When did you figure
all that up?

10:51.216 --> 10:53.283
The minute I saw you.

10:54.518 --> 10:56.552
Why?

10:56.620 --> 11:00.622
Because you may be the
best damn girl in Texas.

11:11.400 --> 11:13.233
You were born

11:13.301 --> 11:15.202
somewhere around
east Texas, right?

11:15.269 --> 11:17.704
Come from
a big old family?

11:17.771 --> 11:18.904
Yeah.

11:18.972 --> 11:21.207
You went to school but
didn't take to it much.

11:21.274 --> 11:23.775
You was lots smarter
than everybody else

11:23.843 --> 11:26.277
so you quit one day.

11:26.345 --> 11:28.713
When you was 16--17,

11:28.780 --> 11:31.382
there was a guy
who worked in a...

11:31.449 --> 11:32.749
Cement plant.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.718
Right. You liked him

11:34.785 --> 11:38.221
'cause he thought you
was as nice as can be.

11:38.288 --> 11:40.223
You almost married
that guy.

11:40.290 --> 11:43.226
Then you got your job
in the cafe.

11:43.293 --> 11:45.760
Now you wake up
every morning,

11:45.828 --> 11:47.262
and you hate it.

11:47.330 --> 11:50.232
You put on
your white uniform--

11:50.299 --> 11:51.732
it's pink.

11:51.799 --> 11:55.036
Truck drivers come in to
eat your greasy burgers.

11:55.103 --> 11:57.904
They kid you,
you kid them back,

11:57.971 --> 12:00.940
but they're dumb boys
with big ol' tattoos.

12:01.008 --> 12:04.443
They ask you for dates.
Sometimes you go,

12:04.511 --> 12:08.447
but all they're ever trying
to do is get in your pants.

12:08.515 --> 12:11.249
You sit in your room
and think,

12:11.316 --> 12:16.187
"when and how am I ever going
to get away from this?"

12:17.821 --> 12:20.023
And now you know.

12:31.367 --> 12:34.069
Change that.
I don't like it.

12:35.671 --> 12:37.237
Mm-hmm.

12:51.184 --> 12:52.451
Mm-hmm.

12:57.822 --> 13:00.224
You're a knockout.

13:09.699 --> 13:12.501
Hey, that ain't ours.

13:12.569 --> 13:14.369
<i>We come in this one.</i>

13:14.437 --> 13:17.671
Don't mean we have
to go home in it.

13:47.764 --> 13:49.298
Clyde?

13:50.601 --> 13:51.867
Clyde!

13:51.935 --> 13:54.302
Hey, lady.

13:54.370 --> 13:55.837
Oh!

13:55.904 --> 13:57.839
Where you been
keepin' yourself?

13:57.906 --> 14:00.374
I slept out
by the car.

14:00.442 --> 14:02.943
These accommodations
ain't particularly deluxe.

14:03.011 --> 14:06.280
If they're after us,
I want the first shot.

14:06.348 --> 14:09.482
Come on, we got
work to do.

14:18.424 --> 14:19.591
Whew!

14:19.659 --> 14:21.058
You're good!

14:21.126 --> 14:23.227
I ain't good.
I'm the best.

14:23.295 --> 14:24.728
And modest.

14:25.697 --> 14:28.331
See that there?
Set her a-spinnin'.

14:30.100 --> 14:33.001
Now try--no.
Set her a-spinnin'.

14:34.937 --> 14:36.539
It's all right.

14:36.606 --> 14:38.207
Try it again.

14:38.275 --> 14:40.741
This time,
come down slow.

14:40.809 --> 14:42.343
All right.

14:46.381 --> 14:47.881
Ha ha ha!

14:47.948 --> 14:50.884
How about that.
Ain't you somethin'?

14:50.951 --> 14:53.419
I'll get you
a Smith & Wesson.

14:53.487 --> 14:55.988
It'll go
in your hand easier.

14:58.824 --> 15:01.926
No, sir.
No, sir.

15:01.994 --> 15:03.895
Y'all go
right ahead.

15:14.871 --> 15:17.773
It used to
be my place,

15:17.841 --> 15:19.874
but it's not
anymore.

15:21.977 --> 15:23.945
The bank took it.

15:29.017 --> 15:31.784
Yes, sir,
they moved us off.

15:31.852 --> 15:34.053
Now it belongs
to them.

15:37.957 --> 15:39.458
That's a shame.

15:39.526 --> 15:41.126
You're damn right.

15:46.865 --> 15:50.435
Me and him put in
the years here.

15:50.502 --> 15:54.170
Yes, sir. You all
go right ahead.

15:54.239 --> 15:58.006
We just come by
for a last look.

16:17.758 --> 16:19.825
Y'all mind?

16:19.893 --> 16:23.194
Hey, Davis,
come on over here.

16:36.674 --> 16:38.275
That's right.

16:42.079 --> 16:43.579
Go on.

16:52.421 --> 16:54.121
Look!

16:56.591 --> 16:57.991
Much obliged.

16:58.058 --> 16:59.993
My name's
Otis Harris,

17:00.060 --> 17:01.994
and this
is Davis.

17:02.061 --> 17:03.996
We worked
this place.

17:04.063 --> 17:05.998
This here's
miss Bonnie Parker.

17:06.065 --> 17:07.900
I'm Clyde barrow.

17:09.367 --> 17:10.935
Hey!

17:11.002 --> 17:14.271
We Rob banks.

17:23.213 --> 17:26.148
I don't want you
to worry about nothin'.

17:26.215 --> 17:28.517
This will be easy.

17:28.585 --> 17:31.587
Your mama
could take this bank.

17:38.160 --> 17:39.327
All right?

17:40.829 --> 17:44.331
You just be ready
if I need you.

18:08.819 --> 18:10.853
What are you
waiting for?

18:19.295 --> 18:21.762
All right, now!
This is a stickup.

18:21.830 --> 18:25.098
Take it easy, and nothing
will happen to you.

18:25.166 --> 18:27.099
Give me the money.

18:27.167 --> 18:29.068
Give me the money.

18:29.136 --> 18:32.071
There ain't
no money here.

18:32.139 --> 18:35.607
What you talkin' about?
This here's a bank.

18:35.675 --> 18:37.909
<i>It was a bank,</i>

18:37.977 --> 18:40.545
but we failed
three weeks ago.

18:47.685 --> 18:50.086
All right,
get on out here.

18:50.154 --> 18:52.222
Come on out here!

18:59.729 --> 19:02.731
Get on out there
and tell my girl.

19:04.667 --> 19:06.600
Come on,
you tell her.

19:06.668 --> 19:08.736
As I was telling him...

19:12.840 --> 19:15.808
Oh, no. Ha ha ha!

19:41.197 --> 19:44.032
We got $1.98,
and you're laughing.

19:53.975 --> 19:55.408
Let's see, now...

19:55.476 --> 19:57.676
A loaf of bread,
a dozen eggs,

19:57.744 --> 20:01.180
a quart of milk,
four fried pies.

20:07.753 --> 20:11.255
You sure you ain't got
no peach pies?

20:11.322 --> 20:12.422
I don't--

20:37.278 --> 20:40.079
Get the hell
out of here!

20:40.147 --> 20:42.181
Go ahead! Go ahead!

20:42.249 --> 20:43.815
I'm on!

20:45.385 --> 20:47.652
He tried to kill me.

20:47.720 --> 20:50.187
I didn't
want to hurt him.

20:50.255 --> 20:53.190
You try to get
something to eat,

20:53.258 --> 20:55.758
and some son of a bitch
come up on you

20:55.826 --> 20:57.227
with a meat cleaver.

20:57.295 --> 20:59.329
I ain't against him.

21:04.801 --> 21:06.635
I ain't against him.

21:38.095 --> 21:40.564
What was wrong
with that?

21:40.632 --> 21:44.534
Dirt in the fuel line.
Just blowed it away.

21:47.103 --> 21:49.170
Excuse me, ma'am.

21:49.238 --> 21:51.906
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

21:51.974 --> 21:54.042
You're a
smart feller.

21:54.108 --> 21:57.077
You sure know a lot
about automobiles,

21:57.145 --> 21:58.579
don't you?

21:58.647 --> 22:02.048
Yes, I guess I do.

22:02.115 --> 22:04.584
Well, um...

22:04.652 --> 22:08.420
Would you know what
kind of car this is?

22:08.488 --> 22:11.724
This is a four-cylinder
Ford coupe.

22:11.791 --> 22:13.359
No.

22:14.960 --> 22:17.695
It sure is.

22:17.763 --> 22:22.766
<i>This is a stolen
four-cylinder Ford coupe.</i>

22:25.970 --> 22:28.103
You ain't scared,
are you?

22:28.171 --> 22:29.705
Huh?

22:33.009 --> 22:34.942
Heh heh heh.

22:35.010 --> 22:37.111
I believe he is.

22:37.179 --> 22:38.747
It's a pity.

22:38.814 --> 22:42.115
We could have used
a smart boy like that

22:42.183 --> 22:46.118
who knows a great deal
about automobiles.

22:46.186 --> 22:48.621
You a good driver,
boy?

22:48.689 --> 22:50.723
Yeah, reckon I am.

22:52.658 --> 22:55.627
Nah. He's
better off here.

22:55.695 --> 22:57.629
What's your name, boy?

22:57.697 --> 22:59.162
C.w. Moss.

22:59.230 --> 23:01.098
I'm miss Bonnie Parker,

23:01.165 --> 23:03.601
and this here's
Mr. Clyde barrow.

23:03.668 --> 23:06.202
We Rob banks.

23:15.177 --> 23:17.446
Sheesh!

23:17.514 --> 23:20.047
Ain't nothin' wrong
with that, is there?

23:22.183 --> 23:24.118
No. No.

23:24.185 --> 23:27.086
Clyde, he ain't
the one. Let's go.

23:27.154 --> 23:31.124
Wait. You got the guts
for our line of work?

23:31.191 --> 23:34.293
I spent a year
in reformatory.

23:34.360 --> 23:36.629
Ooh!
Man with a record.

23:36.696 --> 23:40.131
You got the nerve to
shortchange old ladies,

23:40.198 --> 23:44.101
but have you got what it
takes to pull bank jobs?

23:44.169 --> 23:46.136
Sure I do.

23:46.203 --> 23:49.406
I ain't afraid, if
that's what you think.

23:49.474 --> 23:51.106
Prove it.

24:19.599 --> 24:22.468
Yup. You'll do
all right.

24:44.887 --> 24:46.688
No.

24:50.458 --> 24:51.825
Uh-uh.

24:55.963 --> 24:57.396
No.

26:36.264 --> 26:38.198
I'm afraid we're
overdrawn again.

26:38.266 --> 26:40.399
This is a stickup.

26:40.467 --> 26:42.235
Ahem!

26:42.302 --> 26:44.537
This here's a stickup!

26:44.605 --> 26:46.006
All right.

26:46.073 --> 26:48.040
Leave it there.

27:02.987 --> 27:05.588
Come on. That's it.

27:20.635 --> 27:22.703
Clyde,
where's the car?

27:22.771 --> 27:25.738
What did he do?
Where's the car?

27:28.108 --> 27:29.408
Here!

27:34.380 --> 27:37.549
What the hell you doin'
parkin' the car?

27:37.616 --> 27:38.816
Go!

27:38.884 --> 27:39.917
Go!

27:39.985 --> 27:42.753
Turn it!

27:46.691 --> 27:48.958
Stop that car!
Stop that car!

27:50.928 --> 27:53.128
Cut left! Left!

28:25.089 --> 28:27.257
You ain't got a brain.

28:37.399 --> 28:39.834
Because of you,
I killed a man.

28:39.902 --> 28:42.503
We'll all be wanted
for murder.

28:53.781 --> 28:55.247
Dumb-ass stupid...

28:55.315 --> 28:56.915
Shh!

28:56.983 --> 28:58.750
What was you
thinking about?

28:58.818 --> 29:02.287
If you do a dumb-ass
thing like that again,

29:02.354 --> 29:03.654
I'll kill you.

29:03.722 --> 29:04.956
Shh.

29:05.023 --> 29:08.192
If you want to talk,
go outside.

29:11.095 --> 29:13.063
<i>Hey, who are you?</i>

29:13.130 --> 29:14.764
<i>You'll find out.</i>

29:14.832 --> 29:17.900
<i>Come on, boys.
We'll begin right here.</i>

29:43.172 --> 29:44.706
Hey, hey, honey.

29:47.143 --> 29:51.078
I want to talk to you
for just a minute.

29:51.146 --> 29:52.679
Sit down.

29:53.581 --> 29:54.714
Look.

29:56.017 --> 29:58.451
This afternoon
we killed a man.

29:58.519 --> 30:01.420
So far, nobody
knows who you are,

30:01.487 --> 30:03.822
but they know
who I am.

30:03.890 --> 30:05.791
They'll be running
after me.

30:05.858 --> 30:09.093
That's murder.
It's gonna get rough.

30:09.161 --> 30:11.095
You still can
get out.

30:11.163 --> 30:13.798
I'll put you
on that bus

30:13.865 --> 30:15.132
back to your mama.

30:15.199 --> 30:18.235
I won't make you
run with me.

30:21.838 --> 30:22.939
No.

30:23.006 --> 30:24.073
Huh?

30:26.509 --> 30:27.909
No!

30:27.977 --> 30:30.878
You could get a rich
man if you tried!

30:30.947 --> 30:33.580
I don't want
no rich man!

30:40.120 --> 30:42.288
You won't have
a minute's peace.

30:42.356 --> 30:44.157
Do you promise?

33:25.026 --> 33:27.728
At least
I ain't a liar.

33:39.872 --> 33:42.907
I told you I wasn't no loverboy.

34:12.033 --> 34:14.466
Let me look
at you, boy.

34:14.534 --> 34:15.501
Hey, hey!

34:15.568 --> 34:17.003
Come on!

34:17.070 --> 34:18.603
Come on!

34:20.706 --> 34:24.009
Come on, boy.
You can do better than that.

34:24.076 --> 34:25.476
Ha ha ha!

34:25.543 --> 34:26.476
Hey.

34:26.545 --> 34:27.945
Hey, how's mama?

34:28.013 --> 34:28.946
Fine.

34:29.014 --> 34:29.947
Sister?

34:30.014 --> 34:31.949
Sent her best
to you.

34:32.016 --> 34:34.483
Must be
all that prison food.

34:34.551 --> 34:36.518
No. It's married life.

34:36.585 --> 34:39.054
You know
what they say.

34:39.123 --> 34:41.556
Face powder
gets a man interested,

34:41.623 --> 34:44.259
but baking powder
keeps him home.

34:45.695 --> 34:49.230
Hey, I want you to meet my wife.
Blanche!

34:49.297 --> 34:50.831
My baby brother.

34:50.899 --> 34:52.699
How are you doing?

34:52.766 --> 34:55.235
How do you do?

34:55.303 --> 34:56.837
Hey, Bonnie!

34:57.839 --> 34:59.439
Hey, Bonnie!
Hey!

34:59.505 --> 35:00.572
Hey!

35:01.574 --> 35:03.976
Hey, wait!
Is it--ooh, boy.

35:04.044 --> 35:05.477
Is this Bonnie?

35:05.545 --> 35:08.980
You're taking good care
of the baby of the family.

35:09.048 --> 35:11.216
I'm so glad
to meet you.

35:11.283 --> 35:13.150
Meet my wife blanche.

35:13.218 --> 35:15.418
This here's Bonnie.

35:15.486 --> 35:16.453
Hi.

35:16.520 --> 35:17.687
Hello.

35:17.755 --> 35:19.155
This is c.W. Moss.

35:19.223 --> 35:22.158
My brother buck
and his wife blanche.

35:22.226 --> 35:24.393
Howdy, everybody!

35:24.461 --> 35:25.894
Howdy, y'all.

35:25.962 --> 35:27.395
Howdy, Mrs. Barrow,

35:27.463 --> 35:30.598
or may I
call you blanche?

35:30.666 --> 35:33.700
I sure am pleased
to meet you.

35:33.768 --> 35:37.571
How did you find us?
You picked a good day.

35:37.638 --> 35:39.572
<i>Is that a new
screenland magazine?</i>

35:39.639 --> 35:41.507
Any pictures
of Myrna loy?

35:41.575 --> 35:43.542
She's my favorite
picture star.

35:43.610 --> 35:45.443
May I?

35:45.511 --> 35:47.980
Let me get
the Kodak here!

35:48.047 --> 35:49.982
Put your pants on,
boy.

35:50.049 --> 35:51.448
Come on,
blanche!

35:51.516 --> 35:53.351
Get out
of there.

35:53.418 --> 35:54.852
Come on.
Over there.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.287
Come on, now.

35:56.355 --> 35:58.288
Come on, now.

35:58.356 --> 36:00.257
Hold on to her there.

36:00.324 --> 36:01.758
I got it.

36:01.825 --> 36:03.693
Did you take
my picture?

36:03.761 --> 36:06.595
I asked you not
to take my picture!

36:06.662 --> 36:08.563
Buck, get one of this.

36:08.631 --> 36:12.267
Hey, I want to talk
to you later on.

36:12.334 --> 36:14.903
You devil, you.

36:16.105 --> 36:17.637
Hold it.

36:19.507 --> 36:20.941
You got that?

36:21.009 --> 36:22.042
Yeah.

36:22.110 --> 36:24.076
You take one of us.

36:24.144 --> 36:25.544
I don't want--

36:25.612 --> 36:27.546
honestly,
I don't want--

36:27.614 --> 36:30.581
come on over here.
Just look over there.

36:30.649 --> 36:32.217
Honey, I don't--

36:32.285 --> 36:33.484
give--

36:33.552 --> 36:35.220
be serious.
Be serious.

36:35.288 --> 36:36.388
Hold still.

36:38.523 --> 36:39.589
Oh!

36:39.657 --> 36:42.592
Let me take one
of Bonnie alone.

36:42.660 --> 36:44.193
O.k.

36:48.165 --> 36:50.565
All right, now.
Oh, honey!

36:50.633 --> 36:52.700
Hey,
come on, now.

36:52.768 --> 36:54.903
A little smile.

36:54.971 --> 36:56.238
A little smile.

36:56.305 --> 36:57.371
Hey.

36:57.439 --> 37:00.341
I want to have
a chat with you.

37:00.409 --> 37:03.327
Why don't you step in
there with Bonnie?

37:03.394 --> 37:05.729
What do you
think of her?

37:05.797 --> 37:07.764
Bonnie?

37:07.832 --> 37:10.032
She's a peach.

37:11.501 --> 37:12.735
Hey.

37:12.803 --> 37:13.902
Uh-huh?

37:17.005 --> 37:18.773
Now, tell--tell me true.

37:18.841 --> 37:20.074
What?

37:20.142 --> 37:23.744
Is she as good
as she looks?

37:25.146 --> 37:27.080
She's better.

37:34.488 --> 37:37.456
It was either you
or him, wasn't it?

37:37.523 --> 37:38.457
What?

37:38.524 --> 37:40.425
The guy
that you killed.

37:40.493 --> 37:42.159
He put me
on the spot.

37:42.227 --> 37:44.194
You had to do it?

37:44.262 --> 37:45.229
Right.

37:45.296 --> 37:46.664
I knew you did.

37:46.732 --> 37:49.599
Don't say anything
to blanche about that.

37:49.667 --> 37:52.635
That time you broke
out of jail--

37:52.703 --> 37:55.103
she talk you
into going back?

37:55.171 --> 37:57.105
Did you hear
about that?

37:57.173 --> 37:58.574
Is that true?

37:58.641 --> 37:59.641
Yeah.

37:59.709 --> 38:02.710
I won't say nothing
to Bonnie about it.

38:02.778 --> 38:05.246
I appreciate that.

38:14.188 --> 38:15.153
Whoa-hoo!

38:15.221 --> 38:18.156
We're gonna
have ourselves a time, boy!

38:18.224 --> 38:19.759
We surely are.

38:21.193 --> 38:22.260
Woo!

38:24.363 --> 38:27.098
What are we
going to do?

38:28.533 --> 38:30.267
Well...

38:30.334 --> 38:31.835
How's this?

38:31.903 --> 38:34.837
I figured we all
drive up Missouri.

38:34.905 --> 38:37.807
They ain't lookin'
for me up there.

38:37.875 --> 38:40.341
We'll have us
a regular vacation.

38:40.410 --> 38:41.309
Right?

38:41.377 --> 38:43.244
Yeah. Uh...

38:44.847 --> 38:46.680
No trouble, now.

38:46.748 --> 38:49.249
I ain't goin'
back to no prison.

38:49.317 --> 38:51.585
I heard you had
trouble there.

38:51.653 --> 38:53.620
You was cutting
on your toes.

38:53.687 --> 38:55.588
I did a little
toe-cutting.

38:55.656 --> 38:57.891
That ain't
half of it.

38:57.958 --> 39:00.959
I did it
to get off work--

39:01.027 --> 39:03.929
breaking rocks with
sledgehammers night and day.

39:03.996 --> 39:06.464
Very next week,
I get paroled.

39:06.532 --> 39:09.834
Walked out of that godforsaken
jail on crutches.

39:09.902 --> 39:11.402
Ain't life grand?

39:19.675 --> 39:22.111
You want
to hear a story

39:22.178 --> 39:25.247
about a boy
who owned a dairy farm?

39:25.315 --> 39:27.281
His old ma was sick.

39:27.349 --> 39:30.318
The doctor
called him over and said,

39:30.385 --> 39:33.286
"your mom's lying there.
She's so sick.

39:33.354 --> 39:37.824
"I want you to persuade her
to take a little Brandy.

39:37.891 --> 39:40.326
Just to pick
her spirits up."

39:40.393 --> 39:42.828
"Ma's a teetotaler,"
he says,

39:42.895 --> 39:44.796
she wouldn't
touch a drop."

39:44.864 --> 39:48.833
"Well, I'll tell you what you do."
That's the doc.

39:48.900 --> 39:51.302
"I'll tell you
what you do.

39:51.370 --> 39:55.305
"You bring in a fresh
quart of milk every day,

39:55.373 --> 39:57.841
and you put
some Brandy in it."

39:57.908 --> 39:59.308
So he did.

39:59.376 --> 40:01.844
He doctored it up
with Brandy,

40:01.911 --> 40:04.812
and he gave it
to his mama.

40:04.880 --> 40:07.815
She drank
a little bit of it.

40:07.883 --> 40:10.352
Next day,
he brought it in again.

40:10.419 --> 40:12.353
She drank a little more.

40:12.420 --> 40:14.821
The third day,
a little more.

40:14.889 --> 40:17.823
The fourth day,
she took a little more.

40:17.891 --> 40:19.325
One week later,

40:19.393 --> 40:23.329
he gave her the milk.
She just drank it down.

40:23.397 --> 40:25.330
She swallowed
the whole thing.

40:25.398 --> 40:28.333
Then she called him over,
she said,

40:28.401 --> 40:31.802
"son, whatever you do,
don't sell that cow."

40:36.575 --> 40:38.642
"Don't sell the cow!"

40:52.804 --> 40:55.707
Bye. I'll be
seeing you soon.

40:55.774 --> 40:57.073
Much obliged.

40:57.141 --> 40:58.775
Bye-bye.

40:58.843 --> 41:00.076
Bye.

41:00.144 --> 41:01.511
Bye.

41:04.648 --> 41:07.550
I give him
a month's rent in advance.

41:07.618 --> 41:10.184
We're all set.
Let's get inside.

41:12.722 --> 41:15.290
I'm taking you
to our first home.

41:16.924 --> 41:19.526
What do you think,
huh? Huh?

41:19.594 --> 41:21.695
Just perfect.

41:21.763 --> 41:23.696
It's your
first home.

41:23.764 --> 41:26.198
Isn't this
lovely?

41:26.267 --> 41:28.701
He give me
the grocery number.

41:28.769 --> 41:32.003
Perfect for all of us,
isn't it?

41:33.973 --> 41:35.873
Clyde?

41:35.940 --> 41:37.375
4337, please.

41:37.442 --> 41:40.177
Hi there.
Smitty's grocery?

41:40.245 --> 41:42.211
Look,
it's so clean, buck,

41:42.280 --> 41:45.248
and a frigidaire,
not an icebox.

41:45.316 --> 41:47.350
...hillsdale Avenue.

41:47.418 --> 41:51.453
Oh, about 8 pounds
of pork chops,

41:51.521 --> 41:53.555
4 pounds of red beans,

41:53.623 --> 41:57.057
some chase & sanborn coffee.

41:57.125 --> 41:59.994
About 8 bottles
of Dr. Pepper.

42:03.631 --> 42:05.565
Ha ha ha!

42:05.633 --> 42:07.401
A-ha ha ha!

42:11.004 --> 42:13.872
You sure
can play checkers.

42:22.681 --> 42:24.615
You need a haircut.

42:24.683 --> 42:27.117
You're looking
just like a hillbilly.

42:27.185 --> 42:29.084
You're like an old man--

42:29.152 --> 42:31.086
playing checkers
all the time,

42:31.154 --> 42:34.690
paying no attention
to your poor lonely wife.

42:36.659 --> 42:38.126
"Oh, daddy.

42:38.194 --> 42:40.094
"You sure do
need a haircut.

42:40.162 --> 42:42.596
"You're just like
a little hillbilly.

42:42.664 --> 42:45.966
I do declare.
Mercy me!"

42:46.034 --> 42:47.967
Don't talk that way.

42:48.035 --> 42:49.969
She's in the next room.

42:50.037 --> 42:53.072
There's always somebody
in the next room--

42:53.140 --> 42:56.041
in this room
or every other room.

42:56.108 --> 42:59.478
Don't you ever want
to be alone with me?

42:59.546 --> 43:01.846
I always feel
like we're alone.

43:01.913 --> 43:05.082
Do you, baby?

43:05.150 --> 43:07.451
I'm hungry.
Hey, buck.

43:19.179 --> 43:20.912
Groceries, ma'am.

43:23.015 --> 43:24.483
How much?

43:24.550 --> 43:26.083
$6.43.

43:31.523 --> 43:32.455
43?

43:32.523 --> 43:34.090
Yes, ma'am.

43:36.059 --> 43:37.594
All right.

43:39.696 --> 43:41.163
Here you are.

43:41.230 --> 43:42.164
O.k.

43:42.231 --> 43:45.133
Let me help you.
Those bags are heavy.

43:45.201 --> 43:47.402
No, thanks.
I'll get them.

43:47.469 --> 43:49.069
Just get the door.

43:49.137 --> 43:50.705
Yes, ma'am.

44:06.051 --> 44:08.986
"But few of them
really are justified,

44:09.054 --> 44:11.988
"if you get right down
to the point.

44:12.056 --> 44:14.491
"You've heard
of a woman's glory

44:14.559 --> 44:16.393
being spent on a--"

44:16.461 --> 44:18.328
did you
write that yourself?

44:18.395 --> 44:21.297
Do you want
to hear this or not?

44:21.365 --> 44:26.835
"Still, you can't always
judge the story as true

44:26.902 --> 44:29.304
"being told by her.

44:31.239 --> 44:34.174
"Now, sal was a gal
of rare beauty,

44:34.242 --> 44:37.344
though her features
were coarse and tough."

44:37.411 --> 44:39.312
I knew that old gal.

44:39.380 --> 44:42.882
She's cockeyed, had a
harelip, and no teeth.

44:42.950 --> 44:45.116
Buck, come on.
Go ahead.

44:45.184 --> 44:48.153
"Now, sal was a gal
of rare beauty,

44:48.221 --> 44:51.021
"though her features
were coarse and tough.

44:51.089 --> 44:53.558
"She never once
faltered from duty

44:53.625 --> 44:56.561
"to play on the up and up.

44:56.628 --> 44:58.562
"Sal told me this tale

44:58.629 --> 45:02.198
"on the evening before
she was turned out free,

45:02.266 --> 45:05.167
"and I'll do my best
to relate it

45:05.235 --> 45:06.736
just as she told me."

45:06.803 --> 45:08.704
Hey, the laws
are outside.

45:08.772 --> 45:11.005
They're blocking
the driveway.

45:12.274 --> 45:14.843
Aaah!

45:15.944 --> 45:17.745
Aaah!

45:17.812 --> 45:19.546
Aah!

45:19.614 --> 45:20.781
Aaah!

45:26.687 --> 45:28.688
Get us out of here!

45:30.690 --> 45:33.191
We got to
get your car out!

45:36.728 --> 45:38.696
I'll blow
that police car!

45:38.764 --> 45:40.531
Come on! Cover me!

45:44.368 --> 45:45.435
Get out of here!

45:49.506 --> 45:51.774
He's got a shotgun!

45:51.841 --> 45:53.041
Hold it!

45:54.310 --> 45:55.410
Aaah!

46:10.156 --> 46:12.090
Keep firing!
Keep firing!

46:12.158 --> 46:13.759
Damn you!

46:13.827 --> 46:15.293
Where's blanche?

46:16.261 --> 46:18.396
They're coming around!

46:23.034 --> 46:24.568
Help!

46:32.559 --> 46:34.592
Aah!

46:34.660 --> 46:35.926
Damn it!

46:35.994 --> 46:37.595
You almost
got us killed!

46:37.663 --> 46:41.765
I thought you'd be
happy if I got shot!

46:41.832 --> 46:44.801
Yeah, it would have
saved us trouble.

46:44.869 --> 46:47.570
Don't let her talk
to me like that.

46:47.638 --> 46:50.673
You shouldn't have done that.
It was dumb.

46:50.740 --> 46:55.610
Buck, I didn't marry you
to see you get shot at.

46:55.678 --> 46:57.646
Please, let's go.
Let's leave.

46:57.713 --> 47:00.013
Make him stop the car.

47:00.081 --> 47:01.615
I can't.

47:03.117 --> 47:04.951
I killed a guy.

47:05.019 --> 47:07.187
Please!

47:07.254 --> 47:11.691
Just shut up! Just shut up
your big mouth!

47:11.758 --> 47:13.659
Cut it out, Bonnie!

47:13.726 --> 47:17.796
You stop the car.
I want to talk to you.

47:34.077 --> 47:36.044
Get rid of her.

47:36.112 --> 47:37.513
She's buck's wife.

47:37.581 --> 47:39.514
Get rid
of them both.

47:39.582 --> 47:41.516
What's the matter
with you?

47:41.584 --> 47:44.018
She's what's
the matter with me.

47:44.086 --> 47:46.086
She's a dumb, stupid,
back-country--

47:46.153 --> 47:47.887
now, you look.

47:47.955 --> 47:49.489
<i>What makes you
any better?</i>

47:49.557 --> 47:52.558
You were just a west
Dallas waitress,

47:52.626 --> 47:54.627
picking up
truck drivers.

47:54.695 --> 47:56.028
Stop it!

47:56.096 --> 47:58.030
Oh, big Clyde barrow,

47:58.098 --> 48:00.064
you're just
like your brother--

48:00.132 --> 48:01.533
ignorant,
uneducated hillbilly.

48:01.601 --> 48:04.035
The only special thing
about you

48:04.103 --> 48:06.537
is your peculiar ideas
about lovemaking,

48:06.605 --> 48:08.706
which is
no lovemaking at all!

48:19.949 --> 48:21.049
No.

48:21.117 --> 48:22.551
Clyde, please, Clyde.

48:22.619 --> 48:24.552
I didn't mean that.

48:24.620 --> 48:25.553
Listen.

48:25.621 --> 48:28.456
It was just
all that shooting.

48:28.523 --> 48:29.990
It was
all those guns.

48:30.058 --> 48:31.324
I got scared.

48:31.392 --> 48:33.826
Please, honey.
I didn't mean it.

48:33.894 --> 48:35.428
All right.

48:38.131 --> 48:39.331
Come on.

49:15.881 --> 49:18.214
"Law enforcement officers

look here.

is a Texas ranger.

your spurs

up there.

I don't think
he's lost.

I think the bank's offering
extra reward money.

52:15.199 --> 52:19.034
Frank just wanted some easy pickings.
Didn't you, frank?

52:19.102 --> 52:21.569
Texas ranger, you're
not doing your job.

52:21.637 --> 52:24.472
You ought to be home
protecting poor folk,

52:24.539 --> 52:26.473
not out chasing
after us.

52:26.541 --> 52:29.844
He ought to be back
protecting the poor folks.

52:29.911 --> 52:33.813
What do you want to take
it so personal for?

52:33.881 --> 52:36.850
We've got to discourage
this bounty hunting

52:36.917 --> 52:38.817
for the barrow gang.

52:38.885 --> 52:40.585
What?

52:40.653 --> 52:42.254
What do you
do with him?

52:42.321 --> 52:43.588
Shoot him?

52:43.656 --> 52:44.756
No!

52:46.424 --> 52:48.025
Come on, now.

52:48.093 --> 52:49.627
Hang him.

Uh-uh.
Take his picture.

52:52.396 --> 52:53.296
Huh?

52:53.364 --> 52:54.831
Take his picture?

52:54.899 --> 52:56.299
We take his picture,

52:56.367 --> 52:59.301
we'll send it
to all the newspapers.

52:59.369 --> 53:03.471
Everybody will see captain frank
hammer with the barrow gang,

53:03.538 --> 53:06.808
and all of us
just as friendly as pie.

53:06.876 --> 53:09.343
We're just about
the friendliest folks

53:11.780 --> 53:15.715
Big old Texas ranger
waves his gun at us,

53:15.784 --> 53:20.853

like he was one of our own.

53:20.921 --> 53:23.989
Hey, buck,
get the Kodak.

53:24.056 --> 53:27.793
Get him up there
on the spare tire, Clyde.

53:28.795 --> 53:31.662
All right. There
we go, my friend.

53:31.729 --> 53:34.698
See what happens for
not doing your job?

53:34.766 --> 53:36.666
Down duncanville
last year,

53:36.733 --> 53:39.702
poor farmers kept you
laws away from us

53:39.770 --> 53:41.204
with shotguns.

53:41.272 --> 53:44.173
You're supposed to
protect them from us.

53:44.240 --> 53:46.141
That don't make sense, do it?

53:47.911 --> 53:50.778
You and Bonnie first.
Get in there.

53:50.846 --> 53:53.514
Friendlylike, you know.

53:53.581 --> 53:57.550
<i>When his friends see this,
he'll wish he was dead.</i>

53:57.618 --> 54:01.521
We're proud to have a Texas
ranger in the family.

54:01.588 --> 54:03.522
Hold it!
Hold it!

54:03.589 --> 54:04.990
How's this?

54:05.058 --> 54:07.726
Good, good, good.
I'm getting it.

54:07.794 --> 54:09.460
Wait. Hold it.

54:13.232 --> 54:15.398
How about that?

54:15.466 --> 54:18.001
You bastard!

54:19.637 --> 54:21.704
Hold on, now!

54:26.276 --> 54:27.676
I got the picture!

54:27.744 --> 54:29.244

I got--

54:29.312 --> 54:30.879
I got
the picture.

54:30.947 --> 54:31.913
I got it!

54:31.981 --> 54:33.581
I got the--

54:33.649 --> 54:35.482
I got
the picture!

54:35.550 --> 54:37.651
I got the--

54:39.620 --> 54:44.023
we will put that picture in
every paper in the country!

54:44.091 --> 54:45.524
We got you!

54:45.592 --> 54:47.625
We got you!

54:47.693 --> 54:49.161
We got you now!

54:49.229 --> 54:50.829
We got you!

54:52.131 --> 54:54.465
Hey, we got you!

54:54.532 --> 54:57.434
You just stay in there
for a while.

54:57.502 --> 54:59.370
We gonna use that--

54:59.437 --> 55:00.904
we got you!

55:00.972 --> 55:02.705
We gonna use you, boy.

55:02.773 --> 55:04.341
We got you!

55:21.405 --> 55:23.806
Good afternoon.
This is the barrow gang.

55:23.874 --> 55:26.542
Now if everybody will
just take it easy,

55:26.610 --> 55:28.177
nobody will get hurt.

55:39.920 --> 55:42.189
That your money
or the bank's?

55:42.257 --> 55:43.590
Mine.

55:43.658 --> 55:45.924
You keep it, then.

55:50.264 --> 55:52.564
Next time,
I'll aim lower.

55:57.136 --> 55:58.303
All right.

56:14.284 --> 56:17.018
Take a good look, pop.
I'm buck barrow.

56:20.222 --> 56:22.223
We're the barrow boys!

56:22.291 --> 56:23.624
Buck!

56:28.329 --> 56:30.397
Happy birthday, hon!

56:43.809 --> 56:46.243
It was
the barrow gang!

56:46.311 --> 56:49.813
I think they was
headed for Oklahoma!

57:03.025 --> 57:04.458
Give me that.

57:08.630 --> 57:10.663
Load this.

57:30.314 --> 57:31.715
There I was,

57:31.782 --> 57:34.884
staring square
into the face of death.

57:43.359 --> 57:44.525
Whoa!

57:59.306 --> 58:03.642
And all I can say is,
they did right by me.

58:03.709 --> 58:06.911
I'm bringing me a mess of
flowers to their funeral.

58:35.469 --> 58:38.605
Slow down, Clyde.
We're in Oklahoma now.

58:40.941 --> 58:43.008
Let's catch them
anyway.

58:44.778 --> 58:46.812
I ain't riskin'
my life in Oklahoma.

59:10.283 --> 59:11.583
Ain't much.

59:11.650 --> 59:13.085
Times is hard.

59:14.686 --> 59:17.721
Well, let's
get down to it.

59:25.229 --> 59:28.230
C.w. Moss.

59:31.101 --> 59:32.601
Money.

59:41.942 --> 59:44.711
All right.
All right.

59:44.778 --> 59:46.112
O.k.

59:46.179 --> 59:47.613
Hey, Clyde,

59:47.680 --> 59:49.582
uh, what about
blanche here?

59:49.649 --> 59:50.849
What?

59:50.917 --> 59:52.883
Well, why not?

59:56.222 --> 59:59.189
I earned my share
same as everybody!

59:59.257 --> 01:00:03.793
I could have got killed!
I'm wanted by the law!

01:00:03.861 --> 01:00:06.362
I could have
got snake bit

01:00:06.430 --> 01:00:09.632
sleeping in them woods
every night.

01:00:09.699 --> 01:00:13.368
I have to take sass
from miss Bonnie Parker.

01:00:13.436 --> 01:00:15.737
I deserve mine!

01:00:15.804 --> 01:00:18.306
Hold on, blanche.
Hold your horses.

01:00:18.373 --> 01:00:20.774
You're going
to get your share.

01:00:26.547 --> 01:00:28.814
I married
a preacher's daughter.

01:00:28.882 --> 01:00:30.750
She's still
taking the collection.

01:00:33.719 --> 01:00:34.919
Mrs. Buck barrow.

01:00:34.987 --> 01:00:36.488
Thank you.

01:00:36.556 --> 01:00:39.290
Don't spend that
all in one place.

01:00:43.295 --> 01:00:45.128
Hey.

01:00:45.196 --> 01:00:48.198
I guess I'll have to
keep saying this.

01:00:48.266 --> 01:00:50.200
Blanche
is married to buck.

01:00:50.268 --> 01:00:51.634
Buck is family.

01:00:51.701 --> 01:00:54.336
My family could use
some of that money.

01:00:54.404 --> 01:00:57.372
Them law's been hangin'
around your mama's house.

01:00:57.439 --> 01:01:00.375
It's too risky
to go up there now.

01:01:00.442 --> 01:01:03.910
Where can we go?
What else do we do?

01:01:03.978 --> 01:01:06.413
There's a hole
in the oil pan.

01:01:06.481 --> 01:01:09.816
We got to swipe another car
to get anywhere.

01:01:15.489 --> 01:01:18.823
Eugene, stop that, now.

01:01:18.891 --> 01:01:20.892
Now, Eugene.

01:01:27.032 --> 01:01:30.599
Gene. Ha ha ha!

01:01:30.667 --> 01:01:32.335
Come on!

01:01:32.403 --> 01:01:34.737
Stop that, Eugene.

01:01:35.872 --> 01:01:38.840
Say, isn't that
your car, Eugene?

01:01:38.908 --> 01:01:40.842
That's my car.

01:01:42.611 --> 01:01:44.878
Hey!

01:01:46.248 --> 01:01:47.681
That's my car!

01:01:47.749 --> 01:01:49.449
Hey!

01:01:50.918 --> 01:01:52.919
That's my car!

01:02:08.766 --> 01:02:10.467
Hey! They're
comin' after us.

01:02:10.535 --> 01:02:12.102
Kick in the pants.

01:02:12.170 --> 01:02:14.204
I'm gonna
tear them apart.

01:02:14.272 --> 01:02:16.105
Those punks.

01:02:16.173 --> 01:02:18.907
Stealing a man's car...

01:02:18.975 --> 01:02:22.843
Wait till I get my hands
on those kids, velma.

01:02:22.911 --> 01:02:24.946
I'm gonna
tear them apart!

01:02:26.449 --> 01:02:28.949
What if they
have guns, Eugene?

01:02:30.918 --> 01:02:33.887
We'd better let
the police handle this.

01:02:33.955 --> 01:02:35.654
Right.

01:02:35.722 --> 01:02:37.856
Now turn around.
Turn around.

01:02:37.924 --> 01:02:41.526
Let's go back to town.
We'll get the sheriff.

01:02:43.929 --> 01:02:45.863
They stopped
chasing us.

01:02:45.931 --> 01:02:47.432
They're turning
around.

01:02:49.767 --> 01:02:51.235
Let's take them.

01:02:51.303 --> 01:02:53.370
Good idea,
Clyde!

01:02:53.438 --> 01:02:57.740
Woo hoo!
Yay!

01:02:57.808 --> 01:02:59.209
Oh, my lord!

01:02:59.276 --> 01:03:01.243
They're coming
after us!

01:03:01.311 --> 01:03:05.046
Step on it, velma.
Velma, step on it.

01:03:05.115 --> 01:03:06.582
I am!

01:03:09.351 --> 01:03:11.352
What did you
do that for?

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:13.221
Step on it, velma.

01:03:13.288 --> 01:03:14.887
Step on it.

01:03:14.955 --> 01:03:16.789
We're gettin' 'em.

01:03:16.857 --> 01:03:18.725
Velma, step on it,
velma!

01:03:18.792 --> 01:03:20.126
Whoo!

01:03:20.193 --> 01:03:23.129
Stop that!
Don't run into them!

01:03:24.397 --> 01:03:25.831
Velma!

01:03:35.673 --> 01:03:37.073
Howdy!

01:03:37.142 --> 01:03:40.109
Hey! What are you
doin' in there?

01:03:40.177 --> 01:03:41.611
Hey!

01:03:41.678 --> 01:03:43.379
How are y'all?

01:03:53.988 --> 01:03:55.922
Get on
out of there.

01:03:55.990 --> 01:03:57.858
Come on. Come on.

01:03:57.925 --> 01:04:02.328
You want to go for a
ride in our new car?

01:04:02.396 --> 01:04:04.764
Can we all
fit in there?

01:04:04.831 --> 01:04:07.799
I get to ride
up front now!

01:04:07.867 --> 01:04:09.268
Finally.

01:04:09.335 --> 01:04:13.204
There's not room
for me now.

01:04:25.715 --> 01:04:27.216
What's your names?

01:04:29.219 --> 01:04:33.154
I'm Eugene--
I'm Eugene grizzard.

01:04:33.222 --> 01:04:35.122
And I'm velma Davis.

01:04:35.191 --> 01:04:37.892
Well,
we're the barrow gang.

01:04:37.959 --> 01:04:39.959
That there's
Clyde driving.

01:04:40.027 --> 01:04:42.429
I'm buck.
That's my wife blanche.

01:04:42.497 --> 01:04:44.164
Bonnie Parker. C.W.

01:04:44.232 --> 01:04:45.631
Don't be scared.

01:04:45.699 --> 01:04:48.634
It ain't like
you was the law.

01:04:48.702 --> 01:04:51.135
You just folks,
just like us.

01:04:51.204 --> 01:04:52.704
Yeah.
That's the truth.

01:04:52.771 --> 01:04:55.940
I expect you been
reading about us.

01:04:56.008 --> 01:04:57.808
Oh, no!
Yes.

01:04:57.875 --> 01:05:02.946
Yes, velma,
we have, too.

01:05:03.014 --> 01:05:06.916
Well, now, you two
must be in love,

01:05:06.983 --> 01:05:09.118
I bet, huh?

01:05:12.188 --> 01:05:14.556
Boy, when are you
gonna marry the girl?

01:05:14.624 --> 01:05:16.358
Buck.

01:05:23.564 --> 01:05:26.499
So, uh, he gave her
the milk, see,

01:05:26.567 --> 01:05:29.502
and she drank
a little bit of it.

01:05:29.570 --> 01:05:33.505
She drank a little more
till one week goes by,

01:05:33.573 --> 01:05:36.507
and she drinks
every drop of it.

01:05:36.575 --> 01:05:38.509
She calls her son over.

01:05:38.577 --> 01:05:41.011
She says, "son,
whatever you do,

01:05:41.079 --> 01:05:43.113
don't sell that cow."

01:05:45.583 --> 01:05:47.618
"Don't sell the cow."

01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:59.961
I'm from Wisconsin
originally--

01:06:00.028 --> 01:06:02.096
where the cheese
comes from.

01:06:02.164 --> 01:06:05.165
Oh, but he just
loves Texas now,

01:06:05.233 --> 01:06:06.767
don't you, Eugene?

01:06:06.834 --> 01:06:08.636
"Don't sell
that cow."

01:06:08.703 --> 01:06:11.937
Hey, uh, how old
are you, honey?

01:06:12.005 --> 01:06:13.706
I'm 33.

01:06:30.554 --> 01:06:31.988
There you go.

01:06:32.055 --> 01:06:33.523
Thanks, buck.

01:06:33.591 --> 01:06:35.991
Didn't I order
some French fries?

01:06:36.058 --> 01:06:38.527
Yeah, you did.
Here you are.

01:06:38.595 --> 01:06:40.028
Here you go.

01:06:40.096 --> 01:06:43.498
Now take it easy on them
French fries, velma.

01:06:43.565 --> 01:06:45.533
Ain't that right,
Eugene?

01:06:45.601 --> 01:06:47.034
This isn't mine.

01:06:47.102 --> 01:06:49.603
I ordered mine
well done.

01:06:49.671 --> 01:06:51.538
Who's got
the other hamburger?

01:06:51.606 --> 01:06:54.607
Oh, is this supposed
to be yours?

01:06:58.745 --> 01:07:00.179
It's o.K.

01:07:00.246 --> 01:07:02.847
I'm sure havin'
a good time.

01:07:02.915 --> 01:07:06.117
Aren't you glad
we picked you up?

01:07:06.185 --> 01:07:08.786
You're a grand host,
buck.

01:07:08.853 --> 01:07:10.721
Join up with us.

01:07:13.725 --> 01:07:16.025
Boy, they sure
would be surprised

01:07:16.092 --> 01:07:18.160
to hear that back home.

01:07:18.228 --> 01:07:22.197
What would bill and Martha
say if they heard that?

01:07:22.264 --> 01:07:24.566
Lordy, they would
have a fit.

01:07:24.634 --> 01:07:27.735
Hey, what do you do
anyhow?

01:07:27.803 --> 01:07:30.438
I'm an undertaker.

01:07:35.108 --> 01:07:37.410
Get them out of here.

01:07:56.977 --> 01:07:59.395
Bonnie!

01:07:59.462 --> 01:08:02.164
Bonnie!

01:08:02.232 --> 01:08:03.566
Bonnie!

01:08:03.634 --> 01:08:05.334
Bonnie!

01:08:06.669 --> 01:08:09.571
I don't see her,
Clyde.

01:08:09.639 --> 01:08:11.940
Bonnie,
where are you?

01:08:12.008 --> 01:08:14.675
Bonnie!

01:08:16.645 --> 01:08:20.680
Oh! Bonnie!

01:08:23.651 --> 01:08:26.084
Where could she
have went, buck?

01:08:26.152 --> 01:08:29.220
Boy, i--i don't know.
I just don't know.

01:08:34.192 --> 01:08:35.660
There!

01:08:35.727 --> 01:08:38.029
Bonnie!

01:08:38.095 --> 01:08:39.696
Bonnie!

01:08:51.439 --> 01:08:53.107
Bonnie!

01:08:53.175 --> 01:08:54.642
Leave me alone!

01:08:54.710 --> 01:08:56.611
Where are you goin'?

01:08:56.679 --> 01:08:58.511
Get away!

01:08:58.580 --> 01:09:00.212
Oh! Oh.

01:09:01.716 --> 01:09:04.149
I want to see my mama.

01:09:04.216 --> 01:09:06.652
I want to see my mama.

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:08.120
Please, honey,

01:09:08.188 --> 01:09:11.221
don't never leave me
without sayin' nothin'.

01:09:13.725 --> 01:09:15.060
All right.

01:09:17.629 --> 01:09:20.029
But--but, Clyde.

01:09:20.098 --> 01:09:22.566
Listen to me,
Clyde, please.

01:09:22.634 --> 01:09:24.901
Now--now listen to me.

01:09:24.969 --> 01:09:26.703
I mean it.

01:09:26.770 --> 01:09:28.370
I been thinkin'
about my mama.

01:09:28.438 --> 01:09:32.841
She's gettin' so old.
I want to see her. Please.

01:09:32.908 --> 01:09:34.408
Please.

01:09:34.477 --> 01:09:35.978
We'll see her.

01:09:38.647 --> 01:09:40.814
We'll see her.

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:10.673
Would you
look at him?

01:10:12.142 --> 01:10:14.209
He just
don't remember me.

01:10:16.178 --> 01:10:19.047
He'll get used
to me, won't he?

01:10:19.115 --> 01:10:21.082
We've been cuttin'
and pastin'

01:10:21.150 --> 01:10:23.583
everything we could
find about you.

01:10:23.652 --> 01:10:27.655
Hey, Clyde, there's a shot
I took of you.

01:10:27.722 --> 01:10:29.656
Ha ha!

01:10:57.714 --> 01:10:59.114
Woo hoo!

01:11:05.721 --> 01:11:06.654
Aah!

01:11:06.722 --> 01:11:08.621
Lord, we thank thee

01:11:08.690 --> 01:11:10.957
for the safety
of our loved ones

01:11:11.025 --> 01:11:14.593
and the food we are
about to receive. Amen.

01:11:17.363 --> 01:11:18.998
I want one.

01:11:19.066 --> 01:11:22.400
Ha ha ha!

01:11:27.172 --> 01:11:29.272
Bye, Clyde.

01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:30.841

01:11:37.314 --> 01:11:40.315
We ain't headed nowheres.

01:11:43.285 --> 01:11:45.921

01:11:45.988 --> 01:11:47.788

01:11:47.856 --> 01:11:50.624
Matthew, fetch

01:11:52.094 --> 01:11:53.526
Mama.

01:11:53.594 --> 01:11:55.561
Mama, why
don't you stay

01:11:55.629 --> 01:11:57.530
a little while
longer, huh?

01:11:57.598 --> 01:11:59.464
O.k.?

01:11:59.532 --> 01:12:02.134
I want you
to have this.

01:12:02.202 --> 01:12:03.535
Come on, boys.

01:12:03.603 --> 01:12:05.570
Come on,
you little rodents.

01:12:05.638 --> 01:12:08.305
We got to go home.

01:12:08.373 --> 01:12:11.075
Clyde, sugar,

01:12:11.143 --> 01:12:13.076
make mama
stay a while.

01:12:13.144 --> 01:12:15.078
You know, Clyde,

01:12:15.146 --> 01:12:18.081
I read about you all
in the papers,

01:12:18.149 --> 01:12:21.550
and I just get scared.

01:12:21.618 --> 01:12:23.052
Don't you believe

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:25.087
what you read
in them newspapers.

01:12:25.155 --> 01:12:27.555
They want us to look big

01:12:27.623 --> 01:12:31.059
so they can look big
when they catch us.

01:12:31.127 --> 01:12:34.361
They won't catch us because
I'm better at runnin'

01:12:34.428 --> 01:12:36.930
than at robbin' banks.

01:12:36.998 --> 01:12:39.165
If we'd done half
what they say,

01:12:39.233 --> 01:12:40.733
we'd be millionaires.

01:12:40.801 --> 01:12:43.236
I ain't gonna
risk my girl

01:12:43.303 --> 01:12:45.070
just to make money,

01:12:45.138 --> 01:12:47.538
uncertain as times are.

01:12:47.606 --> 01:12:49.507
I knowed of a job--

01:12:49.575 --> 01:12:52.843
we could have done
$2,000 as easy as pie.

01:12:52.911 --> 01:12:55.813
I pulled outside there
and saw them laws,

01:12:55.881 --> 01:12:57.814
and I said to myself,

01:12:57.882 --> 01:13:00.183
"Bonnie could
get hurt here."

01:13:00.251 --> 01:13:04.220
So we just drove on.
I let that money lay.

01:13:04.287 --> 01:13:07.122
Maybe you know
the way with her, then.

01:13:07.190 --> 01:13:10.625
I'm just an old woman.
I don't know nothin'.

01:13:10.693 --> 01:13:13.627
This is the way
we make money best.

01:13:13.695 --> 01:13:17.231
We'll quit soon as
hard times is over.

01:13:17.298 --> 01:13:20.834
Just the other night,
me and Bonnie were talkin'

01:13:20.902 --> 01:13:25.070
about when we'll settle down
and get us a home.

01:13:25.138 --> 01:13:26.972
She says to me,

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:30.809
"I couldn't bear to live
more than three miles

01:13:30.876 --> 01:13:33.044
from my precious mother."

01:13:33.112 --> 01:13:36.347
Now, how would you
like that, mother Parker?

01:13:36.415 --> 01:13:38.381
I don't believe I would.

01:13:38.449 --> 01:13:40.717
I surely don't.

01:13:40.785 --> 01:13:43.219
You live
three miles from me,

01:13:43.287 --> 01:13:46.823
and you won't live long.

01:13:46.890 --> 01:13:49.925
You'd best keep runnin',
Clyde barrow.

01:13:49.992 --> 01:13:51.592
You know it.

01:13:55.597 --> 01:13:57.597
Bye, baby.

01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:05.104
Bye, y'all.

01:14:12.045 --> 01:14:14.479
Bye, y'all.

01:14:14.547 --> 01:14:16.113
Bye-bye.

01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:26.055
Who is this here?
Is that your girlfriend?

01:14:26.123 --> 01:14:27.423
Hmm?

01:14:27.491 --> 01:14:29.491
L-o-v-e.

01:14:29.559 --> 01:14:32.528
Whose idea was it
to get bluebirds?

01:14:32.595 --> 01:14:34.863
Bonnie's.
Bonnie picked it out.

01:14:34.931 --> 01:14:37.865
Day after we robbed
the armory.

01:14:37.933 --> 01:14:39.534
Hey, hon,
come over here.

01:14:39.601 --> 01:14:42.536
I want you
to touch somethin' here.

01:14:42.603 --> 01:14:44.070
Oh, no.

01:14:44.138 --> 01:14:46.540
Touch right there.
Go on.

01:14:46.607 --> 01:14:47.807
Ew!

01:14:47.875 --> 01:14:49.441
Ha ha ha ha!

01:14:49.509 --> 01:14:50.509
Ha ha!

01:14:50.577 --> 01:14:52.044
Sweet sour!

01:14:52.111 --> 01:14:55.046
Why don't y'all
go into your own cabin

01:14:55.113 --> 01:14:57.949
if you want to play
with c.W., huh?

01:14:58.017 --> 01:15:00.585
What's the matter
with you now?

01:15:00.653 --> 01:15:02.118
Wait a minute.

01:15:02.186 --> 01:15:04.220
Why should
she wait?

01:15:04.288 --> 01:15:06.289
Hold on!

01:15:06.357 --> 01:15:10.593
Look, I saw a chicken
place a few miles back.

01:15:10.661 --> 01:15:12.562
Who wants to
get some food?

01:15:12.629 --> 01:15:16.464
I do. I'm sick to death
of sitting around here.

01:15:16.532 --> 01:15:18.567
What do y'all want?

01:15:18.634 --> 01:15:20.668
Get us
five chicken dinners.

01:15:22.503 --> 01:15:24.404
Get some dessert, too,

01:15:24.472 --> 01:15:27.674
some peach ice cream
or something, will you?

01:15:51.179 --> 01:15:54.880
Oh, baby, I got
the blues so bad.

01:15:59.186 --> 01:16:00.718
Yeah.

01:16:05.691 --> 01:16:08.225
Is it what
your mama said?

01:16:10.728 --> 01:16:14.230
Wh--what mama?

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:19.734
She's just
an old woman now.

01:16:21.204 --> 01:16:23.238
I don't have no mama.

01:16:26.741 --> 01:16:28.175
No family, either.

01:16:30.212 --> 01:16:33.413
Hey, I'm your family.

01:16:49.228 --> 01:16:51.661
You know, it almost
started to happen.

01:16:51.729 --> 01:16:55.265
I thought we was
really going somewhere.

01:16:56.734 --> 01:16:58.767
But this is it.

01:17:01.738 --> 01:17:03.805
We're just goin'.

01:17:05.374 --> 01:17:08.409
I just--
I love you.

01:17:21.371 --> 01:17:23.839
Sure are smoking
a lot lately.

01:17:23.906 --> 01:17:25.439
So what?

01:17:25.507 --> 01:17:27.575
Nothing.

01:17:30.478 --> 01:17:32.079
Oh, lord.

01:17:33.882 --> 01:17:37.416
Why don't you go back
to your pa's house?

01:17:38.685 --> 01:17:40.686
If I only could.

01:17:40.754 --> 01:17:44.256
If I could only just
do that one thing.

01:17:45.925 --> 01:17:49.327
There's no tellin'
how all this happened.

01:17:49.395 --> 01:17:52.096
I was a preacher's
daughter.

01:17:53.932 --> 01:17:56.866
What church was your pa
affiliated with?

01:17:56.934 --> 01:17:58.434
Baptist.

01:18:05.441 --> 01:18:08.743
He thought the world
of buck, my daddy did,

01:18:08.812 --> 01:18:11.946
even though buck was
servin' time in jail.

01:18:13.949 --> 01:18:17.951
He forgave him because
he paid his debt to society.

01:18:19.253 --> 01:18:21.922
We were
disciples of Christ.

01:18:32.798 --> 01:18:34.732
I ain't got my money.

01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:37.201
Give me some,
will you?

01:18:56.484 --> 01:19:00.321
Get me sheriff smoot
on the phone. Yeah.

01:19:15.834 --> 01:19:19.770
It fits much better
since I took it up.

01:19:29.212 --> 01:19:30.413
The men are on
the other side.

01:20:10.381 --> 01:20:13.048
C.w.! C.W.!
Grenades!

01:20:39.738 --> 01:20:41.206
Open that door!

01:20:47.278 --> 01:20:49.079
Hold it!

01:20:49.147 --> 01:20:50.481
Get down!

01:20:53.917 --> 01:20:55.518
Hey, Clyde!

01:21:13.367 --> 01:21:15.801
Turn your fire down there,
the little guy.

01:21:18.638 --> 01:21:20.839
No! Buck!

01:21:39.022 --> 01:21:40.088
Aah!

01:21:55.136 --> 01:21:57.336
Get on!

01:22:02.042 --> 01:22:03.841
Give me a gun, please!

01:22:03.909 --> 01:22:05.810
Somebody
give me a gun!

01:22:05.878 --> 01:22:08.079
C.w., you're going crazy!

01:22:08.147 --> 01:22:09.680
Oh, no! No!

01:22:09.747 --> 01:22:12.783
Blanche, be quiet.
We're trying to get out.

01:22:38.672 --> 01:22:40.673
It didn't happen,
daddy!

01:22:40.741 --> 01:22:43.775
It didn't happen!
I know it didn't!

01:22:43.844 --> 01:22:45.211
Blanche, stop it!

01:22:45.278 --> 01:22:47.346
You stop it!

01:23:04.261 --> 01:23:08.263
I'd rather go to jail
than go on like this.

01:23:08.331 --> 01:23:10.698
He ain't got a chance.

01:23:10.766 --> 01:23:12.800
Half his head's
blown off.

01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:16.237
Oh, god. Oh, god.

01:23:16.304 --> 01:23:18.105
Dear lord in heaven,

01:23:18.173 --> 01:23:19.573
please help me.

01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:20.674
Blanche...

01:23:20.742 --> 01:23:22.041
And buck will never

01:23:22.109 --> 01:23:25.945
do anything wrong
again in his life.

01:23:28.014 --> 01:23:29.714
My eyes!

01:23:29.782 --> 01:23:32.985
I think I'm blind!

01:23:33.052 --> 01:23:35.686
My eyes!

01:23:35.754 --> 01:23:37.755
Blanche. Blanche.

01:23:37.822 --> 01:23:40.091
The light hurts
so bad!

01:23:40.158 --> 01:23:41.958
Here, hon.
Here.

01:23:43.494 --> 01:23:44.460
Here.

01:23:44.528 --> 01:23:47.629
Tell Clyde to get us
to a doctor.

01:23:47.697 --> 01:23:50.499
Bonnie, we're dyin'!

01:23:50.566 --> 01:23:53.202
Buck can't
be moved now, hon.

01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:57.571
Clyde! Clyde!
Clyde!

01:23:59.641 --> 01:24:02.542
I believe I lost
my shoes, Clyde.

01:24:02.610 --> 01:24:06.079
I think the dog
got them.

01:24:41.810 --> 01:24:43.677
Surrender!

01:24:43.745 --> 01:24:45.378
Buck, in the car.

01:24:45.446 --> 01:24:46.779
Surrender!

01:24:48.249 --> 01:24:49.715
Buck, keep low.

01:25:07.932 --> 01:25:09.632
Yaa haa!

01:25:15.772 --> 01:25:16.872
Pull aside.

01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:18.073
Keep low.

01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:19.240
Pull aside.

01:25:34.671 --> 01:25:36.172
Move up!

01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:37.740
Charlie, don't shoot!

01:25:37.807 --> 01:25:39.775
The kins are
in the crossfire.

01:25:39.843 --> 01:25:41.910
I'll go get the car.

01:25:41.978 --> 01:25:44.245
Buck! No, buck!
This way!

01:25:44.312 --> 01:25:46.313
Come on
through here.

01:25:46.381 --> 01:25:49.016
Get the other car!

01:25:49.084 --> 01:25:51.351
Knock the hell
out of it!

01:26:09.368 --> 01:26:10.968
Woo-hoo!

01:26:13.337 --> 01:26:15.538
Hold your fire!

01:26:15.606 --> 01:26:17.373
Daddy, don't die!

01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:20.209
Daddy, don't!

01:26:20.277 --> 01:26:22.211
I said
hold your fire!

01:26:22.279 --> 01:26:24.212
Can't you leave
him alone?

01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:26.214
He's dying.
Let me go!

01:26:26.282 --> 01:26:28.216
Daddy!
You killed him!

01:26:28.284 --> 01:26:31.752
He's dead and gone.
Don't you see he's dead?

01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:32.719
Daddy!

01:26:32.788 --> 01:26:36.756
Daddy! Daddy!
Don't die, daddy!

01:26:36.824 --> 01:26:38.724
Don't die!

01:26:38.793 --> 01:26:43.628
Oh, daddy! Daddy!

01:26:56.340 --> 01:26:58.508
Aah!

01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:29.600
Maybe--

01:27:29.668 --> 01:27:30.802
shh!

01:27:30.870 --> 01:27:32.304
Shh!

01:29:15.041 --> 01:29:18.109
Can you all spare us
some drinking water?

01:29:18.177 --> 01:29:20.111
Who are you, boy?

01:29:20.179 --> 01:29:22.080
Name is moss.

01:30:00.179 --> 01:30:02.147
It's Clyde barrow
and Bonnie Parker.

01:30:02.215 --> 01:30:04.414
What happened
to them?

01:30:04.482 --> 01:30:05.682
Shh! Hush!

01:30:08.153 --> 01:30:10.286
They famous?

01:30:10.354 --> 01:30:11.687
Sure enough.

01:30:17.794 --> 01:30:19.694
They gonna die?

01:30:20.764 --> 01:30:22.197
Shh!

01:30:29.171 --> 01:30:31.671
Is that really
Bonnie Parker?

01:30:31.739 --> 01:30:33.206
Yeah.

01:31:02.782 --> 01:31:05.249
Daddy! Daddy!

01:31:07.319 --> 01:31:08.719
Who's there?

01:31:08.787 --> 01:31:10.220
C.w.--Clarence.

01:31:10.288 --> 01:31:11.722
Clarence!

01:31:11.790 --> 01:31:13.724
Good to see you,
boy.

01:31:13.792 --> 01:31:15.758
What's that
on your chest?

01:31:15.826 --> 01:31:17.760
A tattoo, daddy.
Come on.

01:31:17.828 --> 01:31:20.196
Come on.

01:31:20.263 --> 01:31:21.797
You got to help them.

01:31:21.864 --> 01:31:22.931
Huh?

01:31:22.999 --> 01:31:25.767
Help me get them in.

01:31:25.835 --> 01:31:27.602
What happened
to them?

01:31:27.670 --> 01:31:29.503
Are you
in trouble, son?

01:31:29.571 --> 01:31:32.006
Clyde barrow
and Bonnie Parker.

01:31:32.074 --> 01:31:35.008
Come on.
Help me get them in.

01:31:44.184 --> 01:31:47.119
How come you marked
yourself all up

01:31:47.187 --> 01:31:48.619
with that tattoo?

01:31:48.687 --> 01:31:51.122
What the hell
made you do

01:31:51.190 --> 01:31:53.657
a damn fool thing
like that?

01:31:53.725 --> 01:31:55.158
You hear me?

01:31:55.226 --> 01:31:57.160
Just open the door,
daddy.

01:32:06.203 --> 01:32:09.838
I come here to question
blanche barrow.

01:32:09.905 --> 01:32:12.207
<i>So you're
the frank hammer, huh?</i>

01:32:12.274 --> 01:32:14.007
Hamer.

01:32:15.309 --> 01:32:17.911
I figure to have
my picture took with them

01:32:17.979 --> 01:32:20.279
just one more time.

01:32:20.347 --> 01:32:23.082
It says here Clyde fled
his dying brother.

01:32:23.150 --> 01:32:25.618
Fled! What do
they mean, fled?

01:32:25.685 --> 01:32:29.087
When he's already dead
when I left him?

01:32:29.155 --> 01:32:31.422
Fled! Newspapers.

01:32:31.490 --> 01:32:34.625
While we're all lying
around here near dead,

01:32:34.692 --> 01:32:37.628
they had us holding up
the national bank.

01:32:37.695 --> 01:32:41.197
They hung that one
on us just for luck.

01:32:41.265 --> 01:32:42.766
Tell you something,

01:32:42.833 --> 01:32:46.635
as soon as we're well,
we'll hold up that bank!

01:32:46.702 --> 01:32:48.403
We're gonna take it!

01:32:48.471 --> 01:32:50.139
Aah.

01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:03.283
They don't know nothin',
do they, honey?

01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:05.217
Hey, how come
they're always

01:33:05.285 --> 01:33:07.753
referring to me
in newspapers

01:33:07.821 --> 01:33:09.955
as an unidentified
suspect?

01:33:10.023 --> 01:33:11.956
Be glad that's
all you are.

01:33:12.024 --> 01:33:15.726
As long as they don't
know your last name.

01:33:15.795 --> 01:33:18.962
Mr. Barrow's lookin' out
for your interests.

01:33:19.964 --> 01:33:21.265
How's it feel

01:33:21.332 --> 01:33:24.234
to have a couple
of big deals

01:33:24.302 --> 01:33:25.935
stay in your house,
huh?

01:33:26.003 --> 01:33:28.104
That's something,
ain't it?

01:33:28.172 --> 01:33:30.739
You've been mighty
nice to us.

01:33:30.808 --> 01:33:33.275
Let us pay you,
say, $40

01:33:33.342 --> 01:33:35.410
for your
hospitality.

01:33:35.477 --> 01:33:38.245
No, no. I'm just
happy to have

01:33:38.313 --> 01:33:40.247
y'all folks
here as company.

01:33:40.315 --> 01:33:43.250
Anybody who's a friend
of my boy--

01:33:43.318 --> 01:33:45.785
let's go have supper.
I'm starving.

01:33:47.321 --> 01:33:50.256
You all are welcome here.
You know that.

01:33:50.324 --> 01:33:53.258
And you just make
yourself right at home

01:33:53.326 --> 01:33:56.295
and stay as long
as you want to.

01:34:03.667 --> 01:34:07.137
You look like trash
all marked up like that.

01:34:07.905 --> 01:34:09.339
Cheap trash!

01:34:11.875 --> 01:34:14.109
Bonnie says
it looks good.

01:34:14.177 --> 01:34:15.811
She's just
cheap trash herself.

01:34:15.879 --> 01:34:18.313
Look what they do
to you.

01:34:18.380 --> 01:34:21.049
Your name's
not in the paper.

01:34:21.116 --> 01:34:23.851
You just get them
pictures on your skin

01:34:23.918 --> 01:34:25.819
by Bonnie and Clyde.

01:34:25.887 --> 01:34:27.855
Shoot. They ain't
nothin' but kids.

01:34:27.922 --> 01:34:29.189
But, daddy--

01:34:29.257 --> 01:34:31.324
I'm so glad your ma
ain't alive

01:34:31.391 --> 01:34:33.226
to see this here thing.

01:34:34.294 --> 01:34:36.862
All jellied up
like that.

01:34:37.930 --> 01:34:42.300
I don't see what's
so, uh, bad about it.

01:34:42.368 --> 01:34:44.368
You wouldn't.

01:34:48.406 --> 01:34:50.940
The word is out
that Bonnie and Clyde

01:34:51.008 --> 01:34:53.442
are holed up
outside of town,

01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:55.911
and they're fixin'
to bust in

01:34:55.979 --> 01:34:57.813
and take blanche out.

01:34:57.881 --> 01:34:59.948
All two of them?

01:35:21.168 --> 01:35:22.133
Blanche
barrow.

01:35:22.201 --> 01:35:24.135
Aah!

01:35:24.203 --> 01:35:25.403
Who's that?

01:35:34.511 --> 01:35:39.148
I guess it's been
kind of rough on you,

01:35:39.216 --> 01:35:40.583
hasn't it?

01:35:42.018 --> 01:35:45.921
Bein' the daughter
of a preacher like you are.

01:35:57.031 --> 01:36:01.433
I imagine old buck wasn't
a bad sort, was he?

01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:03.836
No, he wasn't.

01:36:05.038 --> 01:36:09.340
I reckon Clyde
just sort of...

01:36:10.542 --> 01:36:12.710
Led him astray,
didn't he?

01:36:22.552 --> 01:36:25.354
That's a shame,
blanche.

01:36:29.158 --> 01:36:33.326
Yes, ma'am.
That's a shame.

01:36:33.394 --> 01:36:37.030
They done led
your buck astray.

01:36:37.098 --> 01:36:40.499
Clyde,
his own brother,

01:36:40.567 --> 01:36:43.269
Bonnie...

01:36:43.336 --> 01:36:47.005
And that little feller
that was with you

01:36:47.073 --> 01:36:50.375
when you took that
Texas ranger in Missouri.

01:36:53.578 --> 01:36:56.881
He was with you
all along, wasn't he?

01:37:01.118 --> 01:37:03.519
C.w.

01:37:03.587 --> 01:37:05.054
That's right.

01:37:05.122 --> 01:37:07.389
C.w.

01:37:09.625 --> 01:37:10.993
I, uh...

01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:15.129
I don't recollect
his last name.

01:37:16.598 --> 01:37:17.799
Moss.

01:37:17.866 --> 01:37:20.901
C.w. Moss.

01:37:20.968 --> 01:37:23.103
He was there that day.

01:37:23.171 --> 01:37:25.037
I didn't want to go.

01:37:25.105 --> 01:37:27.072
I didn't want to,

01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:31.043
and buck said we was
just goin' on a visit,

01:37:31.111 --> 01:37:34.578
and we wouldn't do
no stealin' or robbin',

01:37:34.646 --> 01:37:39.082
and we went up to joplin
all of a sudden.

01:37:39.150 --> 01:37:43.553
All of a sudden they all
just started shootin'.

01:37:53.913 --> 01:37:55.847
What you writin'?

01:37:55.915 --> 01:37:58.348
I'm writin' a poem
about us.

01:37:58.416 --> 01:37:59.850
Yeah?

01:37:59.918 --> 01:38:01.952
Let me hear it.

01:38:02.020 --> 01:38:05.421
O.k. Just let me
finish this.

01:38:08.425 --> 01:38:10.358
Um, it's called

01:38:10.426 --> 01:38:12.828
<i>the story
of Bonnie and Clyde.</i>

01:38:12.895 --> 01:38:15.363
"You've heard
the story of Jesse James,

01:38:15.431 --> 01:38:17.364
"of how he lived
and died.

01:38:17.432 --> 01:38:20.367
"If you're still in need
of something to read,

01:38:20.435 --> 01:38:22.803
here's the story
of Bonnie and Clyde."

01:38:22.871 --> 01:38:26.706
Do you think if I sent
that to the newspapers

01:38:26.774 --> 01:38:28.407
they'd print it?

01:38:28.475 --> 01:38:30.943
I'm gonna do it.

01:38:31.011 --> 01:38:34.379
"Now, Bonnie and Clyde
are the barrow gang.

01:38:34.447 --> 01:38:36.914
"I'm sure
you all have read

01:38:36.982 --> 01:38:40.417
"how they Rob and steal,
and those who squeal

01:38:40.485 --> 01:38:42.886
"are usually found
dyin' or dead.

01:38:42.954 --> 01:38:45.388
"They call them
cold-hearted killers.

01:38:45.456 --> 01:38:48.424
"They say they are
heartless and mean.

01:38:48.492 --> 01:38:52.895
"But I say this with pride
that I once knew Clyde

01:38:52.963 --> 01:38:55.797
"when he was honest
and upright and clean.

01:38:55.865 --> 01:38:58.900
"But the laws fooled around,
kept takin' him down

01:38:58.968 --> 01:39:01.402
"and lockin' him up
in a cell,

01:39:01.470 --> 01:39:04.404
"till he said to me,
I'll never be free,

01:39:04.472 --> 01:39:07.407
"so I'll meet
a few of them in hell.

01:39:07.475 --> 01:39:09.842
"If a policeman
is killed in Dallas,

01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:11.911
"and they have
no clue to guide,

01:39:11.979 --> 01:39:13.913
"if they can't find
a fiend,

01:39:13.981 --> 01:39:15.947
"they just wipe
their slate clean

01:39:16.015 --> 01:39:18.416
"and hang it
on Bonnie and Clyde.

01:39:18.484 --> 01:39:21.419
"If they try to act
like citizens

01:39:21.487 --> 01:39:23.954
"and rent them
a nice little flat,

01:39:24.022 --> 01:39:26.924
"about the third night
they're invited to fight

01:39:26.992 --> 01:39:29.425
"by a sub-gun's
rat-a-tat-tat.

01:39:29.493 --> 01:39:32.896
"Someday they'll
go down together.

01:39:32.963 --> 01:39:34.430
"They'll Bury them
side by side.

01:39:34.498 --> 01:39:36.665
"To few it'll be grief,

01:39:36.733 --> 01:39:38.967
"to the law, a relief,

01:39:39.035 --> 01:39:42.303
but it's death
for Bonnie and Clyde."

01:39:44.539 --> 01:39:46.974
You know
what you done there?

01:39:47.042 --> 01:39:48.975
You told my story.

01:39:49.043 --> 01:39:52.245
You told my whole story
right there.

01:39:52.313 --> 01:39:53.446
Right there.

01:39:53.514 --> 01:39:56.481
I told you I'd
make you somebody--

01:39:56.549 --> 01:39:59.451
you've done that for me.

01:39:59.519 --> 01:40:02.821
You've made me somebody
they're going to remember.

01:41:36.718 --> 01:41:38.584
Damn.

01:41:38.652 --> 01:41:41.054
Hey, uh,
how do you feel?

01:41:41.121 --> 01:41:42.588
Fine.

01:41:42.656 --> 01:41:45.224
I mean, do you feel how
you're supposed to

01:41:45.291 --> 01:41:48.060
when you...
After you...

01:41:48.127 --> 01:41:49.094
Yeah.

01:41:49.162 --> 01:41:50.562
Well, that's good.

01:41:50.629 --> 01:41:53.564
I figure it's
a good idea to ask

01:41:53.631 --> 01:41:56.567
because how else are
you going to know

01:41:56.634 --> 01:41:58.368
if, you know...

01:41:58.435 --> 01:42:02.438
Hey, you done
just perfect.

01:42:05.675 --> 01:42:07.943
I did, didn't I?

01:42:09.645 --> 01:42:11.445
I really did.

01:42:12.982 --> 01:42:15.083
I never figured
on that.

01:42:15.150 --> 01:42:16.450
Damn!

01:42:17.685 --> 01:42:19.119
Oh, Clyde,

01:42:19.187 --> 01:42:22.455
why do you want
to marry me?

01:42:24.657 --> 01:42:27.960
To make an honest woman
out of you.

01:42:31.697 --> 01:42:34.099
What would you do...

01:42:34.166 --> 01:42:36.101
What would you do

01:42:36.168 --> 01:42:38.102
if some miracle
happened,

01:42:38.169 --> 01:42:41.138
and we could walk
out of here

01:42:41.206 --> 01:42:43.139
tomorrow morning

01:42:43.207 --> 01:42:47.143
and start all over
again clean,

01:42:47.211 --> 01:42:51.646
with no record
and nobody after us?

01:42:51.714 --> 01:42:53.481
Huh?

01:43:00.688 --> 01:43:02.488
Well, uh...

01:43:03.690 --> 01:43:06.993
I guess I'd do it
all different.

01:43:09.195 --> 01:43:12.131
First, I wouldn't live
in the same state

01:43:12.198 --> 01:43:14.133
where we pull our jobs.

01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:17.135
Live in another state
and stay clean there,

01:43:17.202 --> 01:43:20.638
and then when we wanted
to take a bank,

01:43:20.705 --> 01:43:23.506
we'd go
into the other state.

01:43:28.711 --> 01:43:30.512
Bonnie?

01:43:37.219 --> 01:43:39.020
Bonnie.

01:43:45.210 --> 01:43:47.144
Boy,
did they expect you

01:43:47.212 --> 01:43:49.579
to go downtown
with them tomorrow?

01:43:49.646 --> 01:43:50.914
Who?

01:43:50.981 --> 01:43:52.749
Bonnie and Clyde,
that's who.

01:43:52.817 --> 01:43:55.517
Sure. I always
go with them.

01:43:59.422 --> 01:44:03.524
Yeah. You better.
You better go.

01:44:04.727 --> 01:44:08.161
When they get in their car
to come home,

01:44:08.229 --> 01:44:10.663
don't get back in
with them.

01:44:10.732 --> 01:44:12.165
Why, daddy?

01:44:12.233 --> 01:44:15.334
Listen to your pa once!
I'm your kin!

01:44:15.401 --> 01:44:17.336
Not that there
Clyde barrow!

01:44:17.403 --> 01:44:20.371
What do I say?
I can't get in?

01:44:20.439 --> 01:44:23.441
You tell them nothin',
you hear?

01:44:23.508 --> 01:44:25.710
I made a deal,

01:44:25.778 --> 01:44:29.880
and got you off
with a couple of years.

01:44:29.948 --> 01:44:32.382
You just be
off the streets

01:44:32.450 --> 01:44:35.351
when they go
to get in their car.

01:44:35.418 --> 01:44:38.054
Laws won't catch
Bonnie and Clyde.

01:44:38.122 --> 01:44:40.222
Clyde's got a sense.

01:44:40.289 --> 01:44:42.390
Don't you know that,
daddy?

01:44:42.458 --> 01:44:44.392
Nobody
catches Clyde.

01:44:44.460 --> 01:44:46.160
Never.

01:44:48.964 --> 01:44:50.731
Never!

01:45:19.990 --> 01:45:21.891
What happened to c.W.?

01:45:21.958 --> 01:45:23.893
He's in
the hardware store

01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:26.761
getting light bulbs
for his daddy.

01:45:28.964 --> 01:45:30.364
Oh!

01:45:34.468 --> 01:45:37.404
You gonna
wear 'em like that?

01:45:37.471 --> 01:45:39.471
Drive with one eye
closed.

01:45:39.539 --> 01:45:41.440
Want some ice cream?

01:45:41.508 --> 01:45:42.909
No. Look here.

01:45:42.976 --> 01:45:45.610
Isn't that the prettiest
thing you ever saw?

01:45:45.678 --> 01:45:49.080
You can see every
fingernail of her hand.

01:45:49.148 --> 01:45:51.648
That's pretty.
Where is that boy?

01:45:51.716 --> 01:45:54.318
I'll go get him,
o.K.?

01:46:26.479 --> 01:46:27.579
Gladys Jean.

01:46:27.647 --> 01:46:29.614
Time to go home now.

01:47:05.846 --> 01:47:08.514
We'll get back
in about 20 minutes,

01:47:08.582 --> 01:47:10.515
and we'll
pick him up.

01:47:10.583 --> 01:47:13.018
If his head
wasn't strapped on,

01:47:13.086 --> 01:47:14.887
he'd lose it.

01:47:42.110 --> 01:47:44.912
Honey, isn't that
Malcolm there?

01:48:03.561 --> 01:48:07.231
I got a flat tire.
Ain't got no spare.

01:48:23.545 --> 01:48:24.946
Hey.
