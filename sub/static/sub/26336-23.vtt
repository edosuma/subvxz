00:13.364 --> 00:14.897
Uh-uh.

00:14.966 --> 00:16.710
Why are you uh-uh-ing?
See, there's no room

00:16.734 --> 00:17.967
for conversation here.
- Oh.

00:18.036 --> 00:19.201
So it's like that, huh?

00:19.270 --> 00:20.414
You-You're just gonna
just tell me how it is.

00:20.438 --> 00:22.438
I'm not telling you.
I didn't make the rules.

00:22.507 --> 00:24.140
There's prom rules, right?

00:24.208 --> 00:26.008
There's rules.
Your son picks my daughter up.

00:26.077 --> 00:27.309
Okay, there's corsages.

00:27.378 --> 00:29.412
There's photographs.
They go to the dance.

00:29.480 --> 00:30.613
They come home.
Maybe a kiss

00:30.682 --> 00:32.226
on the cheek, and then
that's it. That's it.

00:32.250 --> 00:33.394
Huh. I'm surprised
you didn't want them

00:33.418 --> 00:34.684
to shake hands at the end.

00:34.752 --> 00:36.452
- They can do that.
- For my own clarity...

00:36.521 --> 00:39.655
Okay.
...this corsage bringing

00:39.724 --> 00:43.192
and photographs and all of that,
that takes place at your house?

00:43.261 --> 00:45.072
Yeah. I mean, I don't see
what the difference is, but yeah.

00:45.096 --> 00:47.074
Oh, you don't see what
the difference... Good, good.

00:47.098 --> 00:48.375
If you don't see
what the difference is,

00:48.399 --> 00:50.099
how about you arrange
for the limousine.

00:50.168 --> 00:51.967
And that way

00:52.036 --> 00:54.170
I can sit at my house
in my easy chair

00:54.238 --> 00:56.172
while all the corsage business
and photographs

00:56.240 --> 00:57.751
takes place at my house.
How about that?

00:57.775 --> 00:59.008
Why don't, um,

00:59.077 --> 01:00.843
Grace and Will just
meet at the dance?

01:00.912 --> 01:02.478
There we go. Problem solved.

01:02.547 --> 01:03.846
No. See, I'm with Danny

01:03.915 --> 01:05.991
on this one. I-I always think
that a boy should pick up a girl

01:05.992 --> 01:06.859
no matter what.

01:06.883 --> 01:08.385
- That's my guy.
- That's right.

01:08.386 --> 01:09.897
I hope this doesn't
mean that you think

01:09.921 --> 01:12.066
that you're driving tomorrow
night. That's not gonna happen.

01:12.090 --> 01:12.871
Wait, hold up.

01:12.872 --> 01:14.659
- What's tomorrow?
- What?

01:14.660 --> 01:16.341
Oh, nothing. We're just
gonna go to a wedding.

01:16.342 --> 01:17.608
Joons is doing me a favor,

01:17.676 --> 01:19.710
and he's gonna be my plus-one.

01:19.778 --> 01:21.578
Why are you looking at me
like that? That's...

01:21.614 --> 01:23.814
- It's a platonic plus-one.
- Mm-hmm.

01:23.994 --> 01:25.282
Obviously.

01:25.351 --> 01:26.695
Don't. You don't need
to do that, guys.

01:26.719 --> 01:28.719
Okay.

01:28.787 --> 01:29.787
Yeah, okay.

01:30.856 --> 01:33.290
You guys are so weird sometimes.

01:34.360 --> 01:36.627
Hey.

01:36.695 --> 01:38.729
Look who it is. Little
sis is back in town.

01:38.797 --> 01:39.963
Sorry we're late.
Hey.

01:40.032 --> 01:41.665
Baggage claim was crazy.

01:41.734 --> 01:42.910
Took forever to get
her stuff. You know.

01:42.934 --> 01:43.701
Huh?

01:43.702 --> 01:44.563
Yeah, like it's my fault.

01:44.587 --> 01:45.637
No, no.
I'm not blaming you.

01:45.638 --> 01:47.638
No, hey, don't listen
to him. We don't.

01:47.706 --> 01:49.518
How are you? Aw. It's good to see you.
You're right on time.

01:49.542 --> 01:51.175
Nice to see you. Hi.
Welcome back, Mary.

01:51.243 --> 01:53.010
Hey, uh, Junior, Tani,

01:53.078 --> 01:54.745
this is my kid sis, Mary.
Hi.

01:54.813 --> 01:56.525
It's nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you. Hello.

01:56.549 --> 01:59.116
Hi. Hello.
Nice.

01:59.185 --> 02:01.118
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
New friends. Good-looking.

02:01.187 --> 02:02.661
Yeah, they're young
and hip and... Mm-hmm.

02:02.685 --> 02:04.885
Able to keep you in touch
and make you look old.

02:04.886 --> 02:06.490
- It's a bonus.
- Mm-hmm, yep.

02:06.559 --> 02:08.125
- Yep.
- Speaking of kids, how's Joanie?

02:08.193 --> 02:09.804
- She's got to be, what, five, six now?
- She's six.

02:09.828 --> 02:11.428
- It's crazy.
- She's six years old.

02:11.497 --> 02:13.697
Thanks for asking.
But she's away at her very first

02:13.766 --> 02:15.232
Girl Scout camp retreat,

02:15.301 --> 02:17.434
so I came here - Yeah.
for a little, short trip.

02:17.503 --> 02:18.747
And that's why I took
a couple days off.

02:18.771 --> 02:20.137
You know, fill the freezer

02:20.206 --> 02:21.939
with mint chip mochi ice creams

02:22.007 --> 02:23.340
and just, you know.

02:23.409 --> 02:25.142
- Nice. You remembered.
- Yeah.

02:25.211 --> 02:27.022
Not that you're gonna be
there to eat them, but yeah,

02:27.046 --> 02:28.078
I remembered.
Uh-oh.

02:28.147 --> 02:30.948
- I knew you were still mad.
- I'm not mad.

02:31.016 --> 02:32.260
- Yes, you are.
- You're totally mad.

02:32.284 --> 02:33.361
Right?
Look at your vein.

02:33.385 --> 02:35.152
You're mad. That vein. Yeah.

02:35.221 --> 02:36.264
Why are you mad? Why is he mad?

02:36.288 --> 02:37.888
Why am I mad?

02:37.957 --> 02:39.223
'Cause I got an Airbnb

02:39.291 --> 02:40.958
'cause I'm freaking allergic

02:41.026 --> 02:43.493
to the cat that he adopted.
- Didn't adopt a cat.

02:43.562 --> 02:44.728
I offered to board the cat

02:44.797 --> 02:46.141
'cause he was gonna
leave it on the street

02:46.165 --> 02:47.698
to fend for itself,
and that won't do.

02:47.766 --> 02:49.233
Okay? I'm just saying,

02:49.301 --> 02:51.379
if there's another reason you
don't want to stay with me...

02:51.403 --> 02:53.637
...then just don't blame it
on Mr. Pickles. That's all.

02:53.706 --> 02:56.540
Maybe, uh, you know, she thinks
it's a little crowded.

02:56.609 --> 02:58.809
You got a Navy SEAL in the
guest room. You got a dog

02:58.877 --> 02:59.977
on the couch.

03:00.045 --> 03:01.812
Yeah, it's like it's
a full house, all right?

03:01.880 --> 03:03.592
- Okay.
- So, I'm looking forward to this Airbnb

03:03.616 --> 03:06.183
'cause it's just nice,
right? New.

03:06.252 --> 03:07.818
So new it doesn't
even have one review.

03:07.886 --> 03:09.553
Not one. No one's
said anything about it.

03:09.622 --> 03:10.532
It may not even exist.

03:10.533 --> 03:13.657
- It's probably a be a disaster.
- I think you're a disaster.

03:13.726 --> 03:15.170
Maybe you should stop
adopting animals.

03:15.194 --> 03:17.394
- No-no disrespect.
- I'm just happy to be here.

03:17.463 --> 03:19.663
Yep. Good to be
home, huh, Mary?

03:19.732 --> 03:22.199
- Just say yes.
- Yes.

03:35.281 --> 03:37.047
Hey, you can't
park there, buddy.

03:37.116 --> 03:38.682
Taxis only.

03:40.653 --> 03:42.319
Hi.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.554
You don't mind if we play music, right?
Uh...

03:44.623 --> 03:46.957
Oh, my gosh, babe.

03:47.026 --> 03:48.592
This is my song!

03:48.661 --> 03:50.427
Yes!

03:53.632 --> 03:55.599
Uh, ma'am, does
this look right?

03:55.668 --> 03:56.867
No.

04:01.373 --> 04:04.241
Oh! See that bakery up-up there?

04:04.310 --> 04:06.443
- Is that where you're going?
- No.

04:06.512 --> 04:09.313
But they have
a lovely haupia pie.

04:10.516 --> 04:12.582
Brah, I'm gonna puke.

04:12.651 --> 04:13.717
Uh, okay.

04:18.123 --> 04:19.589
Wait, wait.

04:19.658 --> 04:21.257
No, I'm not.

04:22.328 --> 04:23.727
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

04:23.796 --> 04:25.462
Yes!

04:25.531 --> 04:27.331
- Message him.
- Yes!

04:27.399 --> 04:29.800
- Swipe left.
- Yes, girl.

04:29.868 --> 04:31.902
Sir, wake up. This is your stop.

04:31.970 --> 04:33.704
Thank you.
Have a good night.

04:33.728 --> 04:35.728
Thank you.

04:42.348 --> 04:43.825
You've reached Diane.
Leave a message,

04:43.849 --> 04:46.049
and make it a good one.
- Hey, babe.

04:46.118 --> 04:48.452
Uh, I'm just finishing up.
I'll be home soon.

04:48.520 --> 04:50.821
Love you.

04:50.889 --> 04:52.989
Dude, not how this
works. Use the app.

04:53.058 --> 04:54.658
Plus, I'm done for tonight.

04:54.727 --> 04:57.561
Drive. Now.

04:57.629 --> 05:00.864

05:31.330 --> 05:34.030
Oh, good morning, Ms. Rey.

05:34.099 --> 05:36.867
Are you all set for your
big wedding tonight?

05:36.935 --> 05:39.269
I am, yes. And I noticed,
actually, your eyebrows

05:39.338 --> 05:41.138
had a lot to say
about the matter

05:41.206 --> 05:42.217
when it was brought up
yesterday.

05:42.241 --> 05:43.721
So you think you can
read my eyebrows?

05:43.776 --> 05:45.876
Child, please.

05:45.944 --> 05:47.878
Better try Sanskrit.
It'd be easier.

05:47.946 --> 05:49.246
All right.

05:49.314 --> 05:51.581
Okay, all right,
fine. I-I'll admit

05:51.617 --> 05:54.050
I was mildly curious
when I heard

05:54.119 --> 05:56.097
that you invited Junior to be
your plus-one to a wedding.

05:56.121 --> 05:59.456
By the way, you know when you
invite somebody to a wedding,

05:59.525 --> 06:01.172
that's usually
considered a date.

06:01.196 --> 06:02.126
Yes.

06:02.127 --> 06:04.995
That is true, but in this case,
Junior knows that we're going

06:05.063 --> 06:06.574
as friends,
and he's just fine with it.

06:06.598 --> 06:08.832
He's cool with it.
He said so himself.

06:08.901 --> 06:10.845
He can say so until the
moon turns to green cheese.

06:10.869 --> 06:12.169
I see how that
boy looks at you.

06:12.237 --> 06:14.905
All right, look.

06:14.973 --> 06:16.072
You two are grown.

06:16.141 --> 06:17.741
I'm not trying to get
in your business.

06:17.810 --> 06:20.010
All I'm trying
to say to you is

06:20.078 --> 06:23.747
it might seem like Junior's a
great, big, tough Navy SEAL,

06:23.816 --> 06:26.850
and he is, but inside
that man's chest

06:26.919 --> 06:28.718
beats the heart
of a puppy dog.

06:28.787 --> 06:31.288
Just be careful.

06:31.356 --> 06:34.291
Lou, it's 2019.

06:34.359 --> 06:35.859
I would hope
that gender politics

06:35.928 --> 06:38.662
have evolved at least
to the point where men and women

06:38.730 --> 06:39.930
can just be friends.

06:39.998 --> 06:41.565
Again with the eyebrows.

06:41.633 --> 06:44.267
You know... You...

06:44.336 --> 06:46.470
Yeah, Duke.

06:46.538 --> 06:48.505
Oh.

06:48.574 --> 06:51.508
Okay. Okay, we're on the way.

06:59.852 --> 07:02.652
Look at you,
forced to drive your own car.

07:02.721 --> 07:04.521
McGarrett must
really have the day off.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.456
Yeah. Can't you tell
I'm glowing?

07:06.525 --> 07:07.691
I feel peaceful.

07:07.759 --> 07:09.426
Yeah? Well, I think whatever

07:09.495 --> 07:11.439
we're about to hear'll wipe
that glow right off your face.

07:11.463 --> 07:12.796
He's right. HPD got a call

07:12.865 --> 07:15.265
from a woman whose boyfriend
didn't come home last night.

07:15.334 --> 07:16.534
He was working the night shift

07:16.568 --> 07:18.008
driving for that
Coast rideshare app.

07:18.036 --> 07:19.970
We traced his sedan,
and we found it here.

07:21.340 --> 07:22.340
Rideshare app.

07:22.407 --> 07:24.641
Since when did it become okay

07:24.710 --> 07:27.878
for any Tom, Dick and Harry
to just hop right into your car?

07:27.946 --> 07:29.779
Well, in this case, it wasn't.

07:29.848 --> 07:30.628
Thanks.

07:30.652 --> 07:32.617
The driver took
two gunshot wounds.

07:32.618 --> 07:35.719
All right. Well, do we have a
line on any Tom, Dick or Harry?

07:35.787 --> 07:37.787
'Cause seems to me
like the passenger

07:37.856 --> 07:39.456
would be a likely suspect.
- Yeah.

07:39.525 --> 07:41.892
That would be a great theory,
but there's one problem.

07:41.960 --> 07:44.461
Passenger
took two bullets himself.

07:44.530 --> 07:45.629
Twist.

07:45.697 --> 07:47.030
What the hell happened here?

07:47.099 --> 07:49.799
I don't know, but Duke's got
something you guys need to see.

07:49.868 --> 07:50.633
Drive.

07:50.657 --> 07:52.657
Driver's a
local named Sam Pukahi.

07:52.738 --> 07:56.106
The hostage taker
is Carter Hill.

07:56.174 --> 07:57.519
According to his license,
he's from New Jersey.

07:57.543 --> 07:58.842
All right, well, that explains

07:58.911 --> 08:00.143
why he doesn't have a car.

08:00.212 --> 08:02.746
Does not explain why he
stuck somebody up with a knife.

08:02.814 --> 08:05.248
Well, judging by the way he
was behaving on that video,

08:05.317 --> 08:08.118
I don't think Mr. Hill
was thinking very clearly.

08:08.186 --> 08:09.386
Seemed really desperate.

08:09.454 --> 08:11.054
He might have been
trying to get away

08:11.123 --> 08:12.756
from a desperate
situation, himself.

08:12.824 --> 08:13.957
So our driver was

08:14.026 --> 08:15.236
in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

08:15.260 --> 08:15.796
Could be.

08:15.797 --> 08:17.928
Our victims
have one thing in common.

08:17.996 --> 08:19.007
The bullets that killed them

08:19.031 --> 08:21.298
are all .22 caliber.

08:21.366 --> 08:23.244
Okay, here's a theory. Hill's
on the run from someone.

08:23.268 --> 08:25.201
That someone catches up to him

08:25.270 --> 08:26.770
and shoots both men dead.

08:26.838 --> 08:28.204
That's the case, then Hill

08:28.273 --> 08:29.273
is the, uh, target.

08:29.341 --> 08:31.141
The driver's the collateral.

08:31.209 --> 08:32.386
So, here's one thing I
don't understand, though.

08:32.410 --> 08:33.721
Why would he put Hill
in the trunk

08:33.745 --> 08:34.923
and then just leave
the other body out?

08:34.947 --> 08:37.480
We can ask the killer
that when we find him.

08:37.549 --> 08:40.583
In the meantime, we need to
find out a little bit more

08:40.652 --> 08:41.684
about Mr. Hill.

08:41.753 --> 08:42.986
Why was he on the island?

08:43.054 --> 08:44.454
So, Adam did look into Hill.

08:44.523 --> 08:46.122
The guy's got no record.

08:46.191 --> 08:47.691
But Carter Hill
turns out to be

08:47.759 --> 08:49.604
a mid-level marketing executive
from Jersey City.

08:49.628 --> 08:50.961
He's in town

08:51.029 --> 08:52.996
for a conference
on digital analytics

08:53.065 --> 08:54.175
and consumer research
statistics.

08:54.199 --> 08:55.332
So, the guy

08:55.400 --> 08:58.335
who abducts a rideshare driver
at knifepoint

08:58.403 --> 08:59.869
and gets dumped in the trunk

08:59.938 --> 09:01.338
of a car

09:01.406 --> 09:03.907
is some middle-management exec

09:03.976 --> 09:06.376
- here talking about statistics?
- Yeah.

09:06.445 --> 09:07.777
And he ended up becoming one.

09:14.490 --> 09:16.596
Look, abducting a driver
at knifepoint,

09:16.597 --> 09:18.163
that's a crazy thing to do.

09:18.232 --> 09:20.332
We need to figure out
what made Hill so desperate

09:20.401 --> 09:21.433
that it compelled him

09:21.502 --> 09:22.701
to do something like that.

09:22.770 --> 09:24.136
Why don't you take the day off

09:24.205 --> 09:26.071
like you said
you were going to, okay?

09:26.140 --> 09:28.140
Go be with your sister.
Fly a kite.

09:28.209 --> 09:30.809
- Have a life. Something, please.
- Excuse me.

09:30.878 --> 09:33.189
I have a life. I'm on my way
to meet Mary for breakfast right now.

09:33.190 --> 09:33.912
Good.

09:33.981 --> 09:36.093
Actually, are you sure
she wants to hang out with you?

09:36.117 --> 09:37.961
'Cause it seemed to me
like she wanted some alone time.

09:37.985 --> 09:39.084
Do you realize

09:39.153 --> 09:40.330
that this whole situation
is your fault?

09:40.354 --> 09:41.720
Right?

09:41.789 --> 09:43.989
If you'd have just taken
that cat in the first place,

09:44.058 --> 09:46.558
my sister wouldn't have to stay
at a stranger's house.

09:46.627 --> 09:48.038
I'll take credit for it,
'cause it seemed to me

09:48.062 --> 09:49.873
that she was thrilled to be
staying at a stranger's house.

09:49.897 --> 09:51.730
No, no, she's not thrilled,
all right?

09:51.799 --> 09:53.665
May-Maybe she's
grudgingly accepting.

09:53.734 --> 09:56.201
I would call it grudgingly
accepting of the situation.

09:56.270 --> 09:58.804
No, no, no, I think
you grudgingly accepted

09:58.873 --> 10:01.039
the situation.
She was completely fine with it.

10:01.108 --> 10:02.241
Says you.

10:02.309 --> 10:03.909
Good rebuttal, Steve.

10:03.978 --> 10:05.255
Hey, Mary's calling
on the other line.

10:05.279 --> 10:07.179
I got to go.
I'll call you later.

10:07.248 --> 10:08.514
Hey, Mary, how you doing?

10:08.582 --> 10:09.893
- Where are you, at the diner?
- No.

10:09.917 --> 10:11.683
I'm not. Um, we need
to take a rain check,

10:11.752 --> 10:12.951
and you need

10:13.020 --> 10:15.587
to come here right away.
- What are you talking about? Why?

10:15.656 --> 10:17.222
Last night
after you dropped me off,

10:17.291 --> 10:18.791
I was walking
to the grocery store,

10:18.859 --> 10:21.293
and I met the guy
across the street, Ben Miller.

10:21.362 --> 10:22.628
He couldn't have been sweeter,

10:22.696 --> 10:25.430
<i>and I told him how much</i>
<i>I was loving the Airbnb,</i>

10:25.499 --> 10:27.599
<i>and he told me</i>
<i>about a Thai restaurant,</i>

10:27.668 --> 10:28.867
and everything was great.

10:28.936 --> 10:30.302
Then last night I'm sitting

10:30.371 --> 10:33.272
out on the lanai,
and I see Ben... pissed.

10:33.340 --> 10:35.974
<i>He's screaming</i>
<i>at some other guy,</i>

10:36.043 --> 10:37.509
<i>and they're</i>
<i>clearly talking about me,</i>

10:37.578 --> 10:39.289
<i>because they're pointing</i>
<i>and they're waving,</i>

10:39.313 --> 10:40.345
<i>and it's very strange.</i>

10:40.414 --> 10:41.513
Right?

10:41.582 --> 10:43.015
Okay. Well, I can see

10:43.083 --> 10:44.817
how that would be
unsettling for you,

10:44.885 --> 10:47.286
but it's not really
any of your business, Mary.

10:47.354 --> 10:49.755
Well, they made it my business,
because it turns out

10:49.824 --> 10:51.623
<i>Mystery Man is the Airbnb host,</i>

10:51.692 --> 10:55.027
<i>and he's so sorry,</i>
<i>but I have to leave here</i>

10:55.095 --> 10:56.361
by 6:00 p.m.

10:56.430 --> 10:57.963
So that Ben Miller guy,

10:58.032 --> 10:59.198
he stabbed me in the back.

10:59.233 --> 11:00.393
I mean, can you believe that?

11:00.434 --> 11:01.700
Yeah, kind of.

11:01.769 --> 11:03.246
I mean, Airbnb's are
technically illegal here,

11:03.270 --> 11:05.190
and the locals hate them--
it's possible that Ben

11:05.239 --> 11:06.405
didn't know that his neighbor

11:06.473 --> 11:07.873
was renting
this joint out online

11:07.942 --> 11:09.541
until you told him about it.

11:09.610 --> 11:11.977
I was so nice to him.

11:12.046 --> 11:13.824
Look, it's fine.
I'll take Pickles to a kennel.

11:13.848 --> 11:14.947
You can pop an allergy pill

11:15.015 --> 11:16.615
on the way to my place, Mary.
Come on.

11:16.684 --> 11:18.483
Steve, how long
have you known me?

11:18.552 --> 11:20.786
You're not gonna leave
that house, are you?

11:20.855 --> 11:23.689
No, I'm not gonna leave,
because I really like this place

11:23.757 --> 11:25.357
and I paid for it, okay?

11:25.426 --> 11:27.459
I'm not gonna let some jerk
intimidate me

11:27.528 --> 11:29.561
into spending my vacation

11:29.630 --> 11:32.898
fighting off anaphylactic shock
at your house.

11:32.967 --> 11:35.000
You know, in fact...

11:35.069 --> 11:38.704
I need you to make a stop
on your way here, please.

11:40.241 --> 11:42.341
Okay.

11:42.409 --> 11:44.276
Morning.

11:44.345 --> 11:45.510
Hi.

11:45.579 --> 11:47.324
Thought I would surprise you
with some <i>malasadas</i>

11:47.348 --> 11:48.580
from Leonard's.

11:48.649 --> 11:51.483
Oh. Wow, that's...
Oh. This is my brother,

11:51.552 --> 11:53.085
- Steve.
- Hello.

11:53.153 --> 11:54.720
Yeah. Check them out.

11:54.788 --> 11:56.021
So good.

11:56.090 --> 11:58.357
- Um... uh...
- Look at this house!

11:58.425 --> 12:00.592
- You have a great house.
- Thanks. You, uh...

12:00.661 --> 12:02.101
Freakin' huge.
...you didn't have to,

12:02.162 --> 12:03.228
with...

12:03.297 --> 12:05.130
Of course I had to.
You've been so generous.

12:05.199 --> 12:06.999
I mean, you gave
me that great

12:07.067 --> 12:08.600
restaurant recommendation.
Can I...?

12:08.669 --> 12:10.480
I do know you're the one trying
to get me kicked out,

12:10.504 --> 12:12.738
but hey, it's okay.

12:12.806 --> 12:14.239
I didn't come
here to fight.

12:14.308 --> 12:15.607
Um, who wants
an Airbnb'er

12:15.676 --> 12:17.776
living, you know,
across the street?

12:17.845 --> 12:20.045
- Right. Yes.
- Right? I get it.

12:20.114 --> 12:22.281
- Technically, it is illegal.
- R-Right.

12:22.349 --> 12:24.616
You know, if you
wanted to report it...

12:24.685 --> 12:27.019
my brother's the
head of Five-O.

12:27.087 --> 12:29.087
You could report
it right now.

12:29.156 --> 12:30.622
By the way...

12:30.691 --> 12:32.057
not for nothin',

12:32.126 --> 12:34.126
but these are really good--
you should try one.

12:34.194 --> 12:36.528
I'm a single
mom, and, uh,

12:36.597 --> 12:38.997
I don't really get
a lot of time to myself,

12:39.066 --> 12:40.999
but this weekend
I have two nights.

12:41.068 --> 12:43.702
Okay? And that
house over there,

12:43.771 --> 12:47.739
it has the most beautiful
outdoor rain forest shower.

12:47.808 --> 12:48.974
I saw it.

12:49.043 --> 12:50.809
It's beautiful.

12:50.878 --> 12:52.277
It's done
really nicely.

12:52.346 --> 12:53.690
- Very relaxing.
- It's amazing.

12:53.714 --> 12:56.615
I mean, as much as I love my
brother, he just doesn't have

12:56.684 --> 12:59.985
a beautiful rain shower--
though he does have a lot of pets.

13:00.054 --> 13:02.287
Looks like
you know something

13:02.356 --> 13:04.523
about having pets, too, huh?

13:04.591 --> 13:06.525
Oh. Yeah, we, um...

13:06.593 --> 13:08.293
well, we have a cat.

13:08.362 --> 13:09.428
I've got a cat.

13:10.531 --> 13:12.097
So, what do
you say?

13:13.634 --> 13:16.802
Could you put up with a very quiet,
law-abiding neighbor

13:16.870 --> 13:19.604
for just one more day?

13:22.543 --> 13:24.810
When in doubt,
use the "single mom" card.

13:24.878 --> 13:26.979
Works every time, I mean.

13:27.047 --> 13:28.580
It might have taken
a little bit

13:28.649 --> 13:30.349
of emotional manipulation,
but I think Ben

13:30.417 --> 13:31.984
is actually a reasonable guy.

13:32.052 --> 13:34.553
Oh, yeah?
I do.

13:34.621 --> 13:36.521
I think Ben's
a liar.

13:36.590 --> 13:38.023
- You do?
- Yep.

13:39.126 --> 13:40.759
Wait.

13:40.828 --> 13:43.628
- What?
- He doesn't have a cat.

13:43.697 --> 13:46.098
Did you have any allergic
reaction over there?

13:46.166 --> 13:48.233
No.

13:48.302 --> 13:49.412
- No. You're fine.
- But that's so weird.

13:49.436 --> 13:51.870
Why would Ben lie
about having a cat?

13:51.939 --> 13:53.032
I don't know.

13:53.056 --> 13:54.607
Okay, so maybe it's not
just that he doesn't like

13:54.608 --> 13:56.775
having strangers around--
maybe he's hiding something.

13:56.844 --> 14:00.712
It's possible. It's also possible he's just
a guy who lied about having a cat.

14:00.781 --> 14:03.181
- But why?
- Mary, I don't know.

14:03.250 --> 14:05.395
It's just what happens.
I'll tell you one thing, though.

14:05.419 --> 14:06.985
It doesn't make him
interesting,

14:07.054 --> 14:08.198
and it definitely
doesn't make him worth

14:08.222 --> 14:10.322
talking about when
we're supposed to be spending

14:10.391 --> 14:11.790
the day together.

14:11.859 --> 14:13.058
What the hell?

14:21.335 --> 14:24.269
"We need to talk about Ben
Miller-- behind the banyan tree,

14:24.338 --> 14:26.038
one hour."

14:26.106 --> 14:28.240
Okay. Now, <i>that,</i>

14:28.308 --> 14:30.242
that's interesting.

14:30.310 --> 14:32.144
Let's go,
<i>Murder, She Wrote.</i>

14:34.648 --> 14:37.015
So, here's what we know.
Carter Hill landed on Oahu

14:37.084 --> 14:39.873
three nights ago, spent
the last two days at his

14:39.874 --> 14:41.598
marketing conference,
and then late last night

14:41.622 --> 14:43.455
he becomes Pukahi's passenger,

14:43.524 --> 14:45.223
hostage taker,
and one of the victims

14:45.292 --> 14:46.324
in a double homicide.

14:46.393 --> 14:48.693
He was here with
three colleagues

14:48.762 --> 14:50.962
from the Jersey City-based
company they work for.

14:51.031 --> 14:52.497
No wife, no kids.

14:52.566 --> 14:54.166
Financials indicate

14:54.234 --> 14:55.934
he hardly left the hotel.

14:56.003 --> 14:58.003
All credit card charges
are for on-site restaurant,

14:58.072 --> 14:59.171
bar and coffee shop.

14:59.239 --> 15:00.772
I mean,
not to speak ill

15:00.841 --> 15:02.441
of the dead, but, like...

15:02.509 --> 15:04.776
is there anything interesting
about this man?

15:04.845 --> 15:06.178
- At all?
- It's not much,

15:06.246 --> 15:11.049
but he did make a relatively
sizable withdraw from the ATM

15:11.118 --> 15:13.118
at the hotel
yesterday afternoon.

15:13.187 --> 15:15.120
That's interesting-- $600.

15:15.189 --> 15:17.489
Mm, could be. Or it could be
a great big nothingburger.

15:17.558 --> 15:19.891
What we really need to find out
is what this guy

15:19.960 --> 15:21.493
was doing
last night.

15:21.562 --> 15:23.028
Hey. So, I got something.

15:23.097 --> 15:26.698
CSU found a Wi-Fi-enabled
mileage tracker in Pukahi's car.

15:26.767 --> 15:29.846
It collects location data so that drivers
can figure out their mileage for taxes.

15:29.870 --> 15:32.437
So does that mean that we'll be
able to see where our vics drove

15:32.506 --> 15:34.206
last night?
- Exactly.

15:34.274 --> 15:36.519
This is everywhere Pukahi went
last night during his shift.

15:36.543 --> 15:38.910
I looked into his Coast driver
account, and if we isolate

15:38.979 --> 15:40.545
the beginning
of the hostage taking

15:40.614 --> 15:42.581
as the end of his last paid ride

15:42.649 --> 15:44.282
- around 2:00 a.m.
- If the term

15:44.351 --> 15:47.486
"as the crow flies" refers
to a direct route,

15:47.554 --> 15:49.287
that crow is drunk off its ass.

15:49.356 --> 15:50.989
Yeah, look at that.
Meandering,

15:51.058 --> 15:52.491
loopy, kind of random.

15:52.559 --> 15:54.392
Looks like he's trying
to shake a tail

15:54.461 --> 15:56.161
or... figure out
where to go next.

15:56.230 --> 15:57.429
The red dot is

15:57.498 --> 15:58.864
where he stopped, I assume?
- Yep.

15:58.932 --> 16:00.499
Looks like
he stopped there

16:00.567 --> 16:02.167
for around 15 minutes early on.

16:02.236 --> 16:03.546
You know where that is
specifically?

16:03.570 --> 16:05.315
Kailua. Looks like a back alley.

16:05.339 --> 16:07.873
Okay. It looks like Hill
might not have been

16:07.941 --> 16:09.407
the boring pencil pusher

16:09.476 --> 16:10.609
we thought he was.

16:10.677 --> 16:13.145
Noelani just said
they found cocaine and ecstasy

16:13.213 --> 16:14.412
in his system.

16:14.481 --> 16:15.347
Mm.

16:15.415 --> 16:17.349
Could explain
what the $600 was for.

16:17.417 --> 16:19.351
Yeah. I've seen
this movie before.

16:19.419 --> 16:21.086
Guy blows into town

16:21.155 --> 16:22.621
looking for a good
time, goes out

16:22.689 --> 16:23.989
and gets a little high,

16:24.057 --> 16:26.324
and now he starts flashing
his knot around everywhere.

16:26.393 --> 16:27.737
Next thing you know,
you're getting

16:27.761 --> 16:29.873
the wrong kind of attention
from the wrong kind of people,

16:29.897 --> 16:31.663
and that's where
the trouble begins.

16:31.732 --> 16:33.910
So we just need to figure out
where this guy went partying.

16:33.934 --> 16:35.233
Hill's hotel restaurant charges

16:35.302 --> 16:37.235
were often split
with Austin Matthews,

16:37.304 --> 16:39.237
one of his colleagues
from Jersey City.

16:39.306 --> 16:40.872
- I'll start with him.
- All right,

16:40.941 --> 16:42.919
why don't you guys
go check out what's in that alley.

16:42.943 --> 16:44.910
- Alley duty. Sweet.
- All right.

16:48.382 --> 16:50.148
So, about tonight.
Chivalry aside,

16:50.217 --> 16:53.518
the Hilton is halfway
between both of our houses.

16:53.587 --> 16:54.953
Yes,

16:55.022 --> 16:57.133
I'll admit that meeting there
would be the most efficient way

16:57.157 --> 16:58.723
to do it.
- Also, one thing

16:58.792 --> 17:00.492
I wanted to talk to you about.

17:00.561 --> 17:01.626
There are
gonna be

17:01.695 --> 17:03.295
quite a few...

17:03.363 --> 17:05.730
eligible young
females there,

17:05.799 --> 17:07.109
and I was thinking
that, you know,

17:07.134 --> 17:09.166
maybe we should come up
with some kind of code,

17:09.236 --> 17:10.669
a signal...

17:10.737 --> 17:11.569
for you to...

17:11.637 --> 17:13.003
utilize...
- Mm-hmm.

17:13.073 --> 17:14.313
...um, when you
want me to be...

17:14.374 --> 17:15.674
a wingwoman.

17:15.742 --> 17:16.974
I appreciate it.

17:17.044 --> 17:20.045
But all I want to do is
take advantage of the open bar,

17:20.113 --> 17:21.680
free food,

17:21.748 --> 17:23.080
and dance.
Oh.

17:23.150 --> 17:24.630
We don't have to dance
if you don't...

17:24.685 --> 17:26.444
Oh, no, we're dancing.
You assumed to my face

17:26.486 --> 17:29.854
that I'm a terrible dancer, so
now I have to put you to shame.

17:29.923 --> 17:31.100
Honestly, if you got it,
serve it.

17:31.124 --> 17:32.324
I just don't think you got it.

17:32.392 --> 17:34.326
I guess we'll see, then.

17:34.394 --> 17:36.661
Okay. Serve it.

17:42.169 --> 17:43.702
Uh-oh.

17:43.770 --> 17:45.070
Morning to you, too.

17:45.138 --> 17:47.339
We're working
on a homicide investigation.

17:47.407 --> 17:49.207
Do you recognize this man?

17:51.178 --> 17:53.056
According to his
rideshare history, he was parked

17:53.080 --> 17:54.646
in your alley
for 15 minutes.

17:54.715 --> 17:57.048
Yeah. He checked in
late last night. Paid cash.

17:57.117 --> 18:00.118
Has housekeeping been
to his room yet?

18:00.187 --> 18:02.887
Uh, no. He hasn't
checked out yet.

18:02.956 --> 18:04.234
Trust me,
he's checked out.

18:04.258 --> 18:06.524
- Oh.
- All right, we're gonna need

18:06.593 --> 18:08.827
the key, like, now.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.431
Bingo.

18:15.102 --> 18:17.102
Joons?

18:24.144 --> 18:27.312
If Carter was killed in the car,
then whose blood is that?

18:33.529 --> 18:35.049
<i>So, let me get this straight.</i>

18:35.125 --> 18:37.658
Our Vic rented himself
a motel room

18:37.659 --> 18:39.693
to get high in-- the
whole thing ends up

18:39.761 --> 18:41.027
being a bloodbath? Ooh.

18:41.096 --> 18:41.717
Buzzkill.

18:41.718 --> 18:43.497
Yeah, well, it can't be
Hill's blood,

18:43.498 --> 18:45.138
'cause he bled out
in the trunk of his car

18:45.200 --> 18:47.045
from the gunshot wound,
and there are no other injuries.

18:47.069 --> 18:49.369
Right. So where does the blood
come from? Who's it from?

18:49.438 --> 18:51.805
HPD's interviewing motel guests
as we speak, and so far

18:51.874 --> 18:54.975
no one saw Hill coming or going
with anyone last night.

18:55.043 --> 18:56.610
Well, sorry to pile on
the bad news,

18:56.678 --> 18:58.879
but I talked to Austin Matthews,
Hill's friend

18:58.947 --> 18:59.813
from the conference.

18:59.882 --> 19:00.981
He was shocked to hear

19:01.049 --> 19:02.716
of the drugs in Hill's system.

19:02.784 --> 19:04.451
It seems none
of Hill's colleagues

19:04.519 --> 19:05.552
even knew he'd left

19:05.621 --> 19:06.621
the hotel last night.

19:06.655 --> 19:07.754
Then he was
pretty good

19:07.823 --> 19:09.556
at keeping his bad behavior
on the low.

19:09.625 --> 19:10.991
Hence, the secret motel room.

19:11.059 --> 19:12.158
Still no idea

19:12.227 --> 19:14.060
who Hill was there with,
but we do have a lead

19:14.129 --> 19:15.662
on where he
may have scored his drugs.

19:15.731 --> 19:17.797
Check it out.

19:17.866 --> 19:20.867
Ecstasy pills are often stamped
with an image or logo.

19:20.936 --> 19:23.036
I reached out to Narcotics
to see if they might know

19:23.105 --> 19:24.471
who could have sold these
to Hill.

19:24.539 --> 19:26.106
According to one
of their C.I.'s,

19:26.174 --> 19:27.340
these particular pills

19:27.409 --> 19:28.942
are mostly being dealt
out of a bar

19:29.011 --> 19:30.710
in Kailua, right
in the same neighborhood

19:30.779 --> 19:32.078
as our motel.

19:32.147 --> 19:34.125
Lab results are back
from the blood in the bathroom.

19:34.149 --> 19:35.215
They didn't get a hit,

19:35.284 --> 19:36.316
but it's female DNA.

19:36.385 --> 19:37.785
This guys brings
a lady home.

19:37.819 --> 19:40.153
Obviously,
it did not go... well.

19:40.222 --> 19:42.022
We need to find out
who she is, and I think

19:42.090 --> 19:44.591
a great place to start would be
where Hill scored his drugs.

19:44.660 --> 19:45.892
He could have
met her there.

19:45.961 --> 19:48.061
I'll reach out
to the bar right now.

19:49.631 --> 19:52.332
<i>Well, they said</i>
<i>they were gonna meet us</i>

19:52.401 --> 19:55.001
in an hour-- they're, like,
a couple minutes late.

19:55.070 --> 19:56.503
Whatever. I got
two more minutes,

19:56.571 --> 19:58.611
then I'm going to lunch--
my stomach's done waiting.

19:58.674 --> 20:00.273
What?

20:06.214 --> 20:07.814
Here he is.

20:10.485 --> 20:12.319
Is this from you?

20:12.387 --> 20:14.754
Maybe. You guys cool?

20:14.823 --> 20:16.957
We're on time.

20:17.025 --> 20:20.026
Got held up. Lots of oddballs
around this time of day.

20:20.095 --> 20:21.795
I'm Blake.

20:21.863 --> 20:23.903
Saw you talking to Miller.
You want the dirt on him?

20:23.932 --> 20:27.033
- Yes, we do. Whatcha got?
- It'll come at a price.

20:27.102 --> 20:29.602
- I like this kid. All right.
- Miller has something

20:29.638 --> 20:31.338
of mine-- a drone.

20:31.373 --> 20:34.808
The way I gather the intelligence
I need to keep the 'sac safe.

20:34.876 --> 20:36.643
The 'sac?
The cul-de-sac.

20:36.712 --> 20:38.078
Keep up, lady.

20:38.146 --> 20:39.245
Yeah, keep up, lady.

20:39.314 --> 20:41.047
Okay, so Ben stole your drone?

20:41.116 --> 20:43.583
Well, sort of. Accidentally
crashed it in his backyard,

20:43.652 --> 20:45.385
and now he won't
give it back.

20:45.454 --> 20:48.822
Aha. Okay, so you were spying

20:48.890 --> 20:51.391
with your toy drone,
you crashed it on his property,

20:51.460 --> 20:53.538
and now he won't return it,
is that what you're saying?

20:53.562 --> 20:54.906
You get the drone back
from Miller,

20:54.930 --> 20:56.407
I'll give you the dirt
you're looking for.

20:56.431 --> 20:57.964
You know,
when I was a kid,

20:58.033 --> 21:00.100
if I hit a baseball
over the neighbor's fence,

21:00.168 --> 21:02.602
I'd go knock on their door
and say, "Hello.

21:02.671 --> 21:04.938
I'm Steve. Can I please
have my baseball back?"

21:05.007 --> 21:06.506
You think I haven't
tried that?

21:06.575 --> 21:09.015
- Miller's being a jerk about it.
- I wouldn't want you spying

21:09.077 --> 21:11.945
on my house with your toy camera
in the sky, either, okay?

21:12.014 --> 21:13.324
Would you stop?
I'll bet he doesn't have

21:13.348 --> 21:15.148
anything to tell us anyway.
Wait, wait!

21:15.217 --> 21:17.350
I do! I'll show you!

21:17.419 --> 21:19.052
Okay. Since all
the drone footage

21:19.121 --> 21:21.521
goes to my phone,
I have all the photos

21:21.590 --> 21:22.856
I took up until
it crashed.

21:22.924 --> 21:23.957
- Great.
- Mm-hmm.

21:24.026 --> 21:25.892
What I'm about to show you

21:25.961 --> 21:27.160
is obviously really sensitive

21:27.229 --> 21:28.995
and could get us all murdered.

21:29.064 --> 21:30.897
Are you prepared
to take that risk?

21:30.966 --> 21:32.732
- What?
- Go ahead.

21:35.437 --> 21:39.139
See? They're up all night
doing super-secret stuff.

21:39.207 --> 21:40.707
Even when my parents are asleep.

21:40.776 --> 21:42.342
My bet is,
it's some kind

21:42.411 --> 21:43.443
of government thing.

21:43.512 --> 21:45.945
You guys ever hear
of CIA black sites?

21:46.014 --> 21:48.348
H-Have you ever thought

21:48.417 --> 21:50.984
that maybe your neighbors
are night owls?

21:51.053 --> 21:52.285
No, it is weird

21:52.354 --> 21:53.987
that they stay up all night

21:54.056 --> 21:55.622
and then they go outside
in the dark

21:55.690 --> 21:57.390
to smoke-- they can
just crack the window.

21:57.459 --> 21:59.225
- It's weird.
- Mary...

21:59.294 --> 22:01.039
it's not weird that somebody
doesn't want their house

22:01.063 --> 22:02.195
smelling like
an ashtray.

22:02.264 --> 22:03.930
Are you crazy?
Look, I'm sorry, kid,

22:03.999 --> 22:05.799
your case is just not
strong enough, okay?

22:05.867 --> 22:08.768
Does this mean you're not
gonna give me my drone?

22:12.941 --> 22:15.575
Yeah. I remember him.

22:15.644 --> 22:17.577
It was Carter something.

22:17.646 --> 22:20.013
I made him drinks last night
from about 9:00 to closing.

22:20.082 --> 22:22.348
Okay. Was he alone?

22:22.417 --> 22:24.017
- He came in alone.
- Okay.

22:24.086 --> 22:26.186
But that guy had no
trouble making friends.

22:26.254 --> 22:27.454
Really?

22:27.522 --> 22:28.588
- With who?
- Everyone.

22:28.657 --> 22:30.657
Which is weird,
because the bar is

22:30.725 --> 22:32.525
a locals-only
kind of place.

22:32.594 --> 22:34.561
And that guy is a
straight-up <i>haole.</i>

22:34.629 --> 22:37.964
But he started buying rounds
for all the regulars,

22:38.033 --> 22:39.999
talking to people,
telling jokes.

22:40.068 --> 22:42.502
It's like he wanted to be
everyone's best friend.

22:42.571 --> 22:43.648
That-- I hear ecstasy

22:43.672 --> 22:45.738
will do that to you.
- Mm-hmm.

22:45.807 --> 22:46.639
Ecstasy?
Mm-hmm.

22:46.708 --> 22:49.075
I don't know
anything about that.

22:49.144 --> 22:51.544
Relax, okay? We're not
here about the drugs.

22:51.613 --> 22:52.679
What we need is to know

22:52.747 --> 22:55.048
if Carter left the bar
with a woman.

22:55.117 --> 22:56.349
Yeah.

22:56.418 --> 22:58.218
Kira Pang.

22:58.286 --> 23:00.320
She works at the
bar as a server.

23:00.388 --> 23:01.588
Carter was...

23:01.656 --> 23:02.922
clearly into her.

23:02.991 --> 23:04.491
She gets that a lot, but...

23:04.559 --> 23:06.793
he was being really cute
about it, you know?

23:06.862 --> 23:08.528
We have a jukebox
in the back.

23:08.597 --> 23:10.563
Somehow he found out
her favorite song,

23:10.632 --> 23:14.134
made sure it played every
half hour till closing.

23:14.202 --> 23:15.802
When I left, they
were still talking.

23:15.871 --> 23:18.404
Uh, though the way
they were looking at each other

23:18.473 --> 23:21.975
made it clear that... talking
wasn't all they'd be doing.

23:22.043 --> 23:24.744
Kira said that
she'd close up.

23:24.813 --> 23:27.881
Wait. Why are you
asking me all this?

23:27.949 --> 23:30.083
Is Kira okay?

23:30.152 --> 23:32.485
We don't know.

23:32.554 --> 23:34.754
A woman's blood was found
in a nearby motel room

23:34.823 --> 23:37.090
that Carter Hill
rented last night.

23:37.159 --> 23:40.059
And this morning
he was found murdered.

23:40.128 --> 23:41.794
What happened?

23:41.863 --> 23:43.608
We don't know. That's-that's
what we're trying to find out.

23:43.632 --> 23:47.233
Yeah, I know you said
you left before Kira, but...

23:47.302 --> 23:50.069
can you think of anyone
who might have taken issue

23:50.138 --> 23:52.238
with Kira leaving
the bar with Carter?

23:52.307 --> 23:55.108
Maybe a regular,
someone who liked her,

23:55.177 --> 23:57.544
somebody that
might get jealous.

23:57.612 --> 23:58.711
No.

23:58.780 --> 24:00.747
But we do get
a lot of creeps.

24:00.815 --> 24:03.516
Kira can be a bit wild,
but she's smart.

24:03.585 --> 24:06.119
And she's careful.

24:06.188 --> 24:07.987
I mean, the girl carries
a gun in her purse.

24:08.056 --> 24:09.255
Okay.

24:09.324 --> 24:12.458
Do you by chance know
what kind of gun she carries?

24:12.527 --> 24:14.394
So, it turns out Kira Pang

24:14.462 --> 24:16.129
was carrying a .22,

24:16.198 --> 24:18.431
the same caliber weapon
that was used to kill

24:18.500 --> 24:19.432
both Hill and Pukahi.

24:19.501 --> 24:20.901
Well, that should point
to Kira Pang

24:20.936 --> 24:22.313
as our killer,
except for one thing.

24:22.337 --> 24:23.770
CSU confirmed
that was her blood

24:23.838 --> 24:25.939
in that hotel room,
and a hell of a lot of it.

24:26.007 --> 24:28.308
I can't imagine
she'd be able to...

24:28.376 --> 24:30.376
to chase Hill out
to this remote location,

24:30.445 --> 24:31.978
let alone kill him.

24:32.047 --> 24:34.547
According to Kira's roommate,
she didn't come home last night.

24:34.616 --> 24:36.516
All right, so where is she,
and how did her gun

24:36.585 --> 24:38.029
end up being used
in a double homicide?

24:38.053 --> 24:40.386
Guys, I just spoke to the lab.

24:40.455 --> 24:42.388
In addition to Hill,

24:42.424 --> 24:45.792
there was a second blood type
found in the trunk of the car,

24:45.827 --> 24:47.994
and it matches the blood
that was in the motel.

24:48.063 --> 24:49.063
So Kira was in the trunk?

24:49.097 --> 24:50.174
That would make sense.

24:50.198 --> 24:51.698
Uh, think about it, Cap.

24:51.766 --> 24:54.467
Let's say that Hill brings Kira
back to the motel,

24:54.536 --> 24:55.680
things go sideways,
and then suddenly

24:55.704 --> 24:57.370
he ends up with a dead girl
in his room.

24:57.439 --> 24:59.939
No, take it further.
And then...

25:00.008 --> 25:01.841
he panics,
he realizes

25:01.910 --> 25:04.510
he's got to get rid of this
body, he goes downstairs,

25:04.579 --> 25:07.213
finds Pukahi in a car
a couple of blocks away

25:07.282 --> 25:09.182
to help him get rid of the body?

25:09.251 --> 25:11.896
I don't know. Maybe that's why they went right
to the alley behind the motel.

25:11.920 --> 25:14.120
They're driving around
looking for someplace

25:14.189 --> 25:15.555
to dump this body.

25:15.624 --> 25:17.056
What if they
never got the chance?

25:17.125 --> 25:17.957
What do you mean?

25:18.026 --> 25:19.292
The manager
at the bar

25:19.361 --> 25:21.361
said Kira kept a .22
in her purse,

25:21.429 --> 25:23.730
but we never found a purse
at the motel.

25:23.798 --> 25:24.998
I would think

25:25.066 --> 25:26.566
that Hill moved it
along with the body

25:26.635 --> 25:27.900
when he moved the body.

25:27.969 --> 25:29.689
Except it wasn't at the
crime scene, either.

25:31.139 --> 25:32.405
Maybe...

25:32.474 --> 25:35.575
because Hill tossed the purse
in the trunk

25:35.644 --> 25:36.909
along with Kira.
- Uh-huh.

25:36.978 --> 25:38.077
And...

25:38.146 --> 25:40.513
Okay, this might be
a crazy thought,

25:40.582 --> 25:41.948
but what if Hill

25:42.017 --> 25:44.884
didn't realize that Kira
was actually still alive

25:44.953 --> 25:47.120
when he put her in the trunk?

25:47.188 --> 25:49.088
So he goes to open the trunk.

25:49.157 --> 25:50.990
She's there.
She has the gun.

25:51.059 --> 25:53.226
Bang-- shoots
the first person she sees.

25:53.295 --> 25:54.772
Which I'm guessing
would be the driver,

25:54.796 --> 25:56.729
which would explain
why he was found dead

25:56.798 --> 25:58.498
a few feet away from the car.

25:58.566 --> 26:00.099
That would also explain why Hill

26:00.168 --> 26:01.234
was found in the trunk.

26:01.303 --> 26:02.669
Let's say he goes
for the gun.

26:02.737 --> 26:04.103
She shoots him a
couple of times.

26:04.172 --> 26:05.538
He falls in
the trunk.

26:05.607 --> 26:07.340
Well, by that logic,
that means that she

26:07.409 --> 26:09.142
could still be out there
in the woods where

26:09.210 --> 26:10.788
they found the bodies.
- Yeah, but it's been

26:10.812 --> 26:12.712
over 12 hours,
and she's lost a lot of blood.

26:12.781 --> 26:14.091
We need to get out
there right now.

26:14.115 --> 26:15.315
We need to find her.

26:26.871 --> 26:28.971
Come on.

26:31.576 --> 26:33.108
Over here.

26:36.180 --> 26:37.413
That's got to be Kira's shoe.

26:37.481 --> 26:39.114
She made it a long way.

26:39.183 --> 26:40.494
Come on. Eddie's got something.

26:44.088 --> 26:45.754
There she is.
She's down there.

26:45.823 --> 26:47.957
I'll call for a medevac.

26:48.025 --> 26:50.259
Hey, Kira! I need
you to hold on!

26:50.328 --> 26:53.162
- Okay?
- Please help me.

26:53.231 --> 26:55.464
Please help me.

27:03.307 --> 27:04.640
Mary?

27:04.709 --> 27:06.375
Lunch is here.

27:09.614 --> 27:11.580
Where are you? Mary?

27:18.556 --> 27:19.955
Steve.

27:20.024 --> 27:22.858
Hi. Please tell me you
haven't done something stupid.

27:22.927 --> 27:24.960
Steve, I was right about Ben.

27:25.029 --> 27:27.496
Where are you?

27:27.565 --> 27:29.598
I'm in his basement.

27:29.667 --> 27:31.967
They went out
and left the back door unlocked.

27:32.036 --> 27:34.703
Mary, did you
break into their house?

27:34.772 --> 27:37.339
Have you...
have you lost your mind?

27:37.408 --> 27:39.642
Listen, this is really serious.

27:41.946 --> 27:43.012
What?

27:44.415 --> 27:46.715
Mary, Mary, what'd you find?

28:12.176 --> 28:13.776
Mary. What are you doing here?

28:15.479 --> 28:16.745
I don't know.

28:16.814 --> 28:19.748
I actually cared about finding
that kid's toy, so...

28:19.817 --> 28:21.817
Okay.
And then I found those.

28:21.886 --> 28:24.627
These? What, you call me
in a panic

28:24.651 --> 28:25.855
'cause you found
a pair of rain boots?

28:25.856 --> 28:28.991
Yeah. Rain boots,
cat litter with no cat,

28:29.060 --> 28:31.527
smoking outside...

28:31.595 --> 28:33.195
Thought they were
running a meth lab.

28:33.264 --> 28:34.763
- Meth lab.
- Yeah.

28:34.832 --> 28:38.400
Meth cooks use litter to
absorb the spilled chemicals.

28:38.469 --> 28:41.203
Everyone knows if you light
a cigarette in a meth lab

28:41.272 --> 28:42.410
you're gonna blow up. So yeah.

28:42.434 --> 28:43.640
And working at night

28:43.641 --> 28:45.786
would prevent the neighbors
from seeing what you're doing.

28:45.810 --> 28:47.843
Suburbia is a perfect cover
for a meth lab.

28:47.912 --> 28:49.578
It's actually
a good theory, Mary.

28:49.647 --> 28:51.981
Yeah, but it's not,
'cause I've looked everywhere,

28:52.049 --> 28:53.860
and there's nothing here.
The guy's just a jerk.

28:53.884 --> 28:55.117
Okay, you were right.

28:55.186 --> 28:57.351
I'm just a really bad
judge of character.

28:57.375 --> 28:57.821
Hey.

28:57.822 --> 28:59.722
- I didn't say that.
- But it's true.

28:59.824 --> 29:00.402
Why?

29:00.426 --> 29:02.426
Wrong about Ben, wrong
about what I thought

29:02.460 --> 29:04.193
was going on in this house,
wrong about...

29:04.261 --> 29:05.894
my last three boyfriends,
wrong about

29:05.963 --> 29:07.429
what I did to you.
I lied.

29:07.498 --> 29:09.732
I lied about Airbnb,
but you knew.

29:09.800 --> 29:12.334
I lied because I had
plans to hang out

29:12.403 --> 29:13.914
with my ex-boyfriend
from middle school

29:13.938 --> 29:15.070
that I reconnected with

29:15.139 --> 29:17.272
on the Internet.
He asked me out for a drink.

29:17.341 --> 29:19.742
I said yes, I was so excited,
then he ghosted me.

29:19.810 --> 29:22.144
- He ghosted you?
- Yeah, he never showed up,

29:22.213 --> 29:24.079
'cause I was a really
bad judge of character.

29:25.182 --> 29:27.449
Stop... saying that.

29:27.518 --> 29:29.618
Okay? I don't want
to hear it again. You're wrong

29:29.687 --> 29:31.153
about yourself.
Look at me.

29:31.222 --> 29:32.966
You're in the fight,
you're having a go, okay?

29:32.990 --> 29:34.723
It's more than
I could say for myself.

29:34.792 --> 29:36.392
But what happens
if you find somebody

29:36.460 --> 29:37.793
who's actually good for you

29:37.862 --> 29:39.094
and it works out?

29:39.163 --> 29:40.163
Then what?

29:40.231 --> 29:42.031
It's all worth it, right?

29:42.099 --> 29:43.799
So I'm proud of you, sis.

29:43.868 --> 29:46.035
- I'm proud of you.
- Thank you.

29:46.103 --> 29:47.770
Okay?

29:47.838 --> 29:49.538
Should we go?

29:49.607 --> 29:51.247
We can't go.
I need to ask you a question.

29:51.275 --> 29:52.441
The living room upstairs,

29:52.510 --> 29:53.787
it's right above
this room, right?

29:53.811 --> 29:55.944
Think so. Why?

29:56.013 --> 29:57.691
Well, because it's
a larger space upstairs.

29:57.715 --> 29:59.415
I don't understand this wall
right here.

29:59.483 --> 30:01.150
This wall
doesn't make sense to me.

30:01.218 --> 30:03.819
And it's a CMU wall,
which means it should be structural.

30:05.656 --> 30:07.222
Why doesn't it go
all the way up?

30:09.393 --> 30:10.692
What are you doing?

30:13.931 --> 30:15.497
Wait. Don't go
in there.

30:15.566 --> 30:16.765
Hold on.

30:22.339 --> 30:23.772
Oh, wow.

30:26.744 --> 30:29.511
Whoa. Okay, uh, Mary...

30:29.580 --> 30:33.782
tell me again how you're
a bad judge of character.

30:36.320 --> 30:37.686
- Steve?
- Huh?

30:37.755 --> 30:39.855
- Look.
- What?

30:42.093 --> 30:44.093
Did you remove the tape?

30:44.161 --> 30:45.727
No. Why?

30:45.796 --> 30:47.663
I think someone's in the house.

30:47.731 --> 30:48.764
That's not good.

30:50.768 --> 30:52.835
Okay. That's worse.

30:57.341 --> 30:59.241
Mary, are you sure
this is gonna work?

30:59.490 --> 31:01.457
Just trust me, Steve.

31:13.703 --> 31:15.303
Hey, hey!

31:15.371 --> 31:17.905
Get down and your hands
behind your head! Go!

31:17.974 --> 31:20.408
I'm gonna go crack
a window.

31:20.477 --> 31:22.410
Get up on your feet.
Let's move.

31:30.720 --> 31:31.919
Go, go, go.

31:34.190 --> 31:37.258
Get in the corner.
Turn-- turn around.

31:38.728 --> 31:39.994
You all right?

31:40.063 --> 31:41.496
Yeah.

31:41.564 --> 31:44.265
Good to see you again, neighbor.

31:44.334 --> 31:45.433
Nice job, Mary.

31:45.502 --> 31:46.701
Thanks.

31:46.769 --> 31:48.336
Hey, how'd you know
about that gas?

31:48.404 --> 31:49.770
The Internet.

31:49.839 --> 31:51.739
Okay.

31:51.808 --> 31:53.768
We're very lucky that
they didn't fire their guns.

31:54.777 --> 31:56.544
It's very combustible.

31:57.647 --> 32:00.081
Oh, okay.

32:00.149 --> 32:01.849
All right, medevac's
still ten minutes out.

32:01.918 --> 32:04.886
I don't know, Kira
may not have that long.

32:04.954 --> 32:07.255
No, she doesn't.

32:07.323 --> 32:09.757
She's fading.
She can't hold on much longer.

32:09.826 --> 32:11.092
Hey. No.

32:11.160 --> 32:12.960
No, no, no. Joons,
there's 50 feet

32:13.029 --> 32:15.630
of rock wall between us and her.
- No, I have to go

32:15.698 --> 32:17.610
down there and stabilize her,
okay? I can hold her

32:17.634 --> 32:19.245
against the wall until
the helo gets here.

32:19.269 --> 32:20.269
Joons, that's crazy.

32:20.303 --> 32:21.769
This is every
day with Steve.

32:21.838 --> 32:23.004
Now you know how I feel.

32:24.674 --> 32:26.374
Uh, what, am I gonna stop you?

32:26.442 --> 32:27.875
Thanks.

32:30.847 --> 32:32.480
Hey, Kira!

32:32.549 --> 32:34.482
I'm gonna come down.
I just need you to hold on

32:34.551 --> 32:36.350
a little bit longer--
can you do that?

32:36.419 --> 32:38.319
I don't know.

32:38.388 --> 32:40.888
Yes, you can, okay?
You made it this far.

32:40.957 --> 32:42.156
I'm coming down.

32:42.225 --> 32:43.558
Joons.

32:43.626 --> 32:45.893
I-If you fall, then you
forfeit the dance-off.

32:45.962 --> 32:48.195
I win by default.
Those are the rules.

32:48.264 --> 32:50.364
Don't get your hopes up.

32:51.668 --> 32:52.908
All right, see you soon!

33:09.953 --> 33:11.252
You know what?

33:11.321 --> 33:13.132
I can't watch this. I can't
watch it. Just let me know

33:13.156 --> 33:14.567
- when it's over.
- Lou, not watching

33:14.591 --> 33:16.490
is just gonna make it worse.

33:16.559 --> 33:18.659
I will take my chances,
thank you.

33:25.068 --> 33:26.500
Joons!

33:53.763 --> 33:56.897
Okay, I got you. I'm here.

33:56.966 --> 33:58.299
I got you.

33:58.368 --> 33:59.767
I'm here.

34:04.440 --> 34:06.540
It's gonna be okay.

34:09.045 --> 34:11.012
Hey, buddy.

34:13.016 --> 34:15.349
Hi.

34:15.418 --> 34:17.187
Looks like you're gonna
make the wedding after all.

34:17.210 --> 34:19.210
Mm.

34:20.857 --> 34:22.368
You only, you only get
a few people, right?

34:22.391 --> 34:24.425
- - What?
Uh, people in life

34:24.494 --> 34:26.460
that you... that you
care about, you know?

34:28.264 --> 34:30.504
You're young, you meet new
people all the time, you know?

34:30.565 --> 34:32.600
When you get old, you
get really old like me,

34:32.668 --> 34:35.268
you can count the good
ones on one hand.

34:37.473 --> 34:39.373
Have-have a good
time tonight.

35:08.204 --> 35:10.771
Okay, listen, boy picks
up girl for prom,

35:10.840 --> 35:13.018
even if boy and girl are just
friends who are gonna spend

35:13.042 --> 35:14.186
the whole time eating
cocktail weenies

35:14.210 --> 35:16.744
and maybe come
home early.

35:19.115 --> 35:21.415
You look nice.

35:23.386 --> 35:25.219
Okay, fine.

35:25.288 --> 35:26.732
But you better find
the inner strength

35:26.756 --> 35:28.293
to put it into third gear,
'cause we're late.

35:28.317 --> 35:29.558
Okay.

35:29.559 --> 35:31.370
You know I'm gonna go
exactly the speed limit.

35:31.394 --> 35:33.294
Well, you're far
too predictable.

35:33.362 --> 35:35.529
Ma'am?

35:35.598 --> 35:37.531
Why, thank you, sir.

35:39.469 --> 35:41.335
You know,
sense of accomplishment.

35:41.404 --> 35:42.770
That'll be good.
Yeah.

35:42.839 --> 35:44.205
No, thing... Wt. Whoa.

35:44.273 --> 35:45.473
Well, if it isn't

35:45.541 --> 35:47.074
Miss Nancy Drew

35:47.143 --> 35:48.309
with her bad self.
- Me?

35:48.377 --> 35:49.710
Yeah.
Now, you stop

35:49.779 --> 35:50.779
with all that.

35:50.813 --> 35:52.057
We, uh, hear
congratulations

35:52.081 --> 35:53.814
are in order.

35:53.883 --> 35:55.127
Not that any of us
are surprised.

35:55.151 --> 35:56.817
I mean, you <i>are</i> a McGarrett

35:56.886 --> 35:58.152
after all.
- That's right.

35:58.221 --> 35:59.386
And you know, uh,

35:59.455 --> 36:00.566
what a vacation is, right?
You're not supposed

36:00.590 --> 36:02.389
to be breaking up meth labs,
stuff like that,

36:02.458 --> 36:04.058
when you're on vacation.
- Yes,

36:04.127 --> 36:06.594
I know what a vacation is,
and I still need one.

36:06.662 --> 36:08.095
What's the plan
for tonight?

36:08.164 --> 36:09.523
You're not going back
to that Airbnb, are you?

36:09.547 --> 36:10.432
Hell no.

36:10.433 --> 36:12.511
Mary doesn't know this yet,
but I'm about to book her

36:12.535 --> 36:14.468
a very nice room in
an excellent hotel, and yes,

36:14.537 --> 36:15.647
already checked,
and they have

36:15.671 --> 36:17.304
a luxurious rain forest shower.

36:17.373 --> 36:18.472
Well, how about

36:18.541 --> 36:20.141
if I had other plans?

36:20.209 --> 36:22.343
Do you still have
that mochi ice cream

36:22.411 --> 36:23.411
in your freezer?

36:23.446 --> 36:25.279
Course I do. Always.

36:25.348 --> 36:26.547
Just in case.

36:26.616 --> 36:28.160
Good. 'Cause
I'm coming over.

36:28.184 --> 36:30.151
Good. Who's that?

36:30.219 --> 36:32.253
Oh, my God, it's him.
He's calling me right now.

36:32.321 --> 36:33.721
The guy who ghosted you?

36:33.790 --> 36:35.467
Don't... No, no, no, no.
He had his chance.

36:35.491 --> 36:36.668
He had his chance.
I know, I know, I know.

36:36.692 --> 36:38.058
Oh, don't be like that.

36:38.127 --> 36:39.894
Come on, man, you
were young once.

36:39.962 --> 36:41.829
- Give the man a second chance.
- Young...?

36:41.898 --> 36:43.242
He already blew her off once.
Steve,

36:43.266 --> 36:45.644
maybe the guy had a really good
reason for not calling sooner.

36:45.668 --> 36:47.012
- I mean, come on.
- Let me tell you a really good excuse.

36:47.036 --> 36:48.313
That he's dead
and in the ground.

36:48.337 --> 36:49.381
And he's not dead,
'cause he's calling.

36:49.405 --> 36:50.337
So give me the phone.
Listen,

36:50.406 --> 36:51.438
don't listen to him.

36:51.507 --> 36:52.618
You want her to be
miserable and lonely

36:52.642 --> 36:53.819
like you for the rest
of her life?

36:53.843 --> 36:55.009
Take the phone call.

36:55.077 --> 36:56.622
- No, don't listen to that. Give me the phone.
- Hello?

36:56.646 --> 36:57.578
- Just let her take the call.
- Hey.

36:57.647 --> 36:58.579
- Would you stop?
- How are you?

36:58.648 --> 36:59.914
You know what?
This is on you.

36:59.982 --> 37:01.226
Whatever happens.
What about them?

37:01.250 --> 37:02.250
They were saying stuff.

37:02.318 --> 37:03.784
Why is it on me?
Why you pick on me?

37:03.853 --> 37:04.785
Wait. What?

37:04.854 --> 37:06.253
No way.

37:06.322 --> 37:07.855
No, it's no problem.
We'll talk later.

37:07.924 --> 37:09.490
All right. Bye.

37:09.559 --> 37:10.591
He broke

37:10.660 --> 37:12.426
his freaking leg, okay?
- Aw...

37:12.495 --> 37:14.094
Yeah. Broke
his leg, huh?

37:14.163 --> 37:15.830
- Broke his leg.
- Lucky day!

37:15.898 --> 37:17.731
Congratulations.

37:17.800 --> 37:20.212
You tell him to bring that X-ray
along with him tonight, okay?

37:20.236 --> 37:21.513
'Cause I want to see it.
Come on,

37:21.537 --> 37:23.337
Steve, lighten up.
All right, well, look,

37:23.406 --> 37:26.240
if he flakes on you again, I'm
gonna break his other leg, okay?
