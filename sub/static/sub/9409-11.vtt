- It'll taste just fine.

19:19.767 --> 19:22.800
What's the matter with you two?
Pick up your spoons and eat it.

- [ Gasps ]

19:36.667 --> 19:39.167
[ Doorbell Rings ]

19:39.167 --> 19:42.667
When I get back,
I expect those bowls to be empty.

[ Doorbell Rings ]

19:49.000 --> 19:50.933
[ Dad ]
Dr. Marek.

19:50.933 --> 19:52.767
- What are you doing here?
- Watch for Dad.

19:52.767 --> 19:54.267
As I said a few weeks ago,

19:54.267 --> 19:56.267
I'll come by and check
on how your work's coming,

19:56.267 --> 20:00.300
- and I was in the neighborhood.
- Come on. Hurry.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.233
You know, I've always thought
that you were.

20:02.733 --> 20:05.233
It wasn't my idea to let you go.
The board forced me.

20:05.233 --> 20:06.733
But I'm not giving up yet.

20:06.733 --> 20:09.233
So now let's see what kind
of progress you've made.

20:09.233 --> 20:12.800
Oh! Hi, guys.
How are you?

20:12.800 --> 20:16.300
- Have you finished your breakfast?
- Yeah. It was pretty good.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.800
Look, I'll-- I'll just
be down there, okay?

20:18.800 --> 20:21.667
Hey, um--

20:21.667 --> 20:24.800
I want you kids
to go outside and play.

20:27.600 --> 20:29.600
[ Birds Twittering ]

20:30.600 --> 20:32.467
I don't believe anything
Dad says anymore.

20:32.867 --> 20:35.400
At least Dad told us
about his experiments.

20:35.900 --> 20:38.867
Yeah, but what about that gross junk
he tried to make us eat?

20:39.367 --> 20:41.433
Good one.

20:44.933 --> 20:47.433
[ Dad ] Dr. Marek, if you
would have backed me...

20:47.433 --> 20:49.433
- when I brought in my numbers...
- [ Dr. Marek ] I tried to.

20:49.933 --> 20:52.033
They were good numbers.
They were very, very good numbers.

20:52.533 --> 20:54.033
But the university
never got the numbers.

20:54.533 --> 20:56.133
- [ Margaret ] Casey?
- Wait.

20:56.133 --> 20:58.800
- I was always trying to make a case.
- Dr. Brewer, please.

20:59.333 --> 21:01.267
- All by myself--
- Listen to me--

21:01.767 --> 21:03.733
[ Arguing, Indistinct ]

21:11.733 --> 21:13.967
[ Dr. Marek ]
No!
