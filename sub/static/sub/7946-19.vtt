00:08.250 --> 00:09.730
So, is everybody up

00:09.731 --> 00:11.209
for a nice quiet evening

00:08.250 --> 00:11.209
at home?

00:11.250 --> 00:12.793
Not that I seem to have

00:12.794 --> 00:14.334
any other kind of evening.

00:14.375 --> 00:15.772
Actually, it will be anything

00:15.773 --> 00:17.167
but quiet for me.

00:17.209 --> 00:18.897
Tonight, an asteroid

00:18.898 --> 00:20.584
will be passing very close

00:17.209 --> 00:20.584
to Earth,

00:20.626 --> 00:22.313
and my stargazing club

00:22.314 --> 00:24.000
is meeting in the park

00:20.626 --> 00:24.000
to observe it.

00:24.042 --> 00:25.042
Par-tay!

00:26.626 --> 00:28.500
Turn down for telescopes.

00:30.083 --> 00:32.042
- There is also a young
- lady in our group

00:32.083 --> 00:33.500
Who I plan to ask out.

00:33.542 --> 00:35.334
- She is quite
- the astro-babe.

00:35.375 --> 00:36.668
Oh, Ravi, I'm sure

00:36.669 --> 00:37.959
she'll say yes.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.168
But just in case,

00:39.169 --> 00:40.334
you may want to mention

00:38.000 --> 00:40.334
you're rich.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.271
Hey, Ravi, want me

00:43.272 --> 00:44.542
to come with and be

00:42.000 --> 00:44.542
your wingman?

00:44.584 --> 00:46.417
That would be awesome!

00:46.459 --> 00:48.042
I shall go grab my scope.

00:48.083 --> 00:49.918
- And put on my
- formfitting kurta.

00:49.959 --> 00:51.400
- I've been doing
- cha-cha aerobics.

00:54.500 --> 00:56.210

00:56.211 --> 00:57.918
to be there for your brother.

- Are you kidding?

00:59.334 --> 01:00.481
Ravi's going to

01:00.482 --> 01:01.626
ask a girl out.

01:01.667 --> 01:03.428
- I wouldn't want to miss
- that train wreck.

01:05.083 --> 01:06.584
I'll go fluff

01:06.585 --> 01:08.083

- Oh, Jessie,
- I'm going out, too.

get to stay out all night

01:19.292 --> 01:20.918
and I can't?

01:20.959 --> 01:22.001
Because I know Marcie's

No, unfair is having to take

your cousin to homecoming

01:35.125 --> 01:37.042
- because no one else
- would ask them.

06:41.586 --> 06:42.918
every 30 minutes

06:42.959 --> 06:44.042
or you get cranky.

something over here.

07:38.834 --> 07:40.250
Yes, with my honey!

07:41.918 --> 07:43.584
And that was too loud.

07:45.083 --> 07:46.459
Look, I've found a secret

07:46.460 --> 07:47.834
government website,

07:47.876 --> 07:49.250
showing that the asteroid

07:49.292 --> 07:50.626
is going to hit New York

07:50.627 --> 07:51.959
within the hour!

07:52.000 --> 07:53.396
Okay, if this was true,

07:53.397 --> 07:54.792
then why haven't they

07:52.000 --> 07:54.792
told anyone?

07:54.834 --> 07:57.105
Shh! Because they wish

07:57.106 --> 07:59.375
to avoid a widespread panic.

07:59.417 --> 08:01.001
That is why it is a secret.

08:01.002 --> 08:02.584
Right!

08:02.626 --> 08:04.768
- Just like they're keeping it
- a secret that the pyramids

08:04.792 --> 08:05.897
Were actually built

08:05.898 --> 08:07.000
by space dolphins.

08:08.500 --> 08:09.709
Yes, just like that.

08:11.417 --> 08:13.500
Look and see for yourself.

08:17.292 --> 08:18.876
(GASPS)

08:18.877 --> 08:20.459
Oh, my gosh!

08:20.500 --> 08:22.772
I told you so!

08:22.773 --> 08:25.042
It is bigger, is it not?

08:20.500 --> 08:25.042
Yeah.

08:25.083 --> 08:27.022
And over here,

08:27.023 --> 08:28.959
Emma is hanging

08:25.083 --> 08:28.959
from our terrace!

08:30.375 --> 08:31.855
Correction, Emma was

08:31.856 --> 08:33.333
hanging from our terrace.

08:33.375 --> 08:34.918
(GASPING)

08:34.919 --> 08:36.458
She just fell into

08:33.375 --> 08:36.458
Mrs. Chesterfield's hot tub!

08:36.500 --> 08:38.188
(LAUGHING)

08:38.190 --> 08:39.876
Awesome! I love hocking

08:36.500 --> 08:39.876
loogies in there.

08:39.918 --> 08:41.558
- It's one of my top ten
- favorite spots.

08:42.667 --> 08:44.292
I have a blog.

08:47.083 --> 08:49.042
- Dude, what's
- going to happen?

08:49.083 --> 08:50.251
Well, Emma will

08:50.252 --> 08:51.417
surely be grounded

08:51.459 --> 08:53.751
for her insubordination,

08:53.752 --> 08:56.042
and...

08:51.459 --> 08:56.042
I meant, to Earth!

08:56.083 --> 08:57.563
Right. We may not

08:57.564 --> 08:59.042
die from the impact,

08:59.083 --> 09:00.563
but after many years,

09:00.564 --> 09:02.042
poisonous radiation

08:59.083 --> 09:02.042
will turn us

09:02.083 --> 09:04.147
into horribly disfigured

09:04.148 --> 09:06.209
slaves to our mutant

09:02.083 --> 09:06.209
lizard overlords.

09:06.667 --> 09:08.250
Oh!

09:08.292 --> 09:10.146
Oh, man! What should I do?

09:10.147 --> 09:12.000
A, be nicer to Mrs. Kipling.

09:13.834 --> 09:16.417
And B, just do what I did.

09:16.459 --> 09:18.606
Simply put on your

09:18.607 --> 09:20.751
aluminum foil long

09:16.459 --> 09:20.751
johns for protection.

09:20.792 --> 09:22.459
- When did you have
- time to do that?

09:22.500 --> 09:23.500
While you were flirting

09:23.501 --> 09:24.501
with my lady!

09:26.083 --> 09:27.251
I have got to learn to

09:27.252 --> 09:28.417
dial down the theatrics.

09:30.042 --> 09:31.542
Okay, Ravi, unlike you,

09:31.543 --> 09:33.042
I don't own metal underpants!

09:33.083 --> 09:34.730
But remind me to give you

09:34.731 --> 09:36.375
a wedgie with a magnet later.

09:36.417 --> 09:38.355
Well, unless you want

09:38.356 --> 09:40.292
your first shower in years

09:36.417 --> 09:40.292
to be with radioactive dust,

09:40.334 --> 09:42.188
I suggest you improvise, man!

09:42.189 --> 09:44.042
Improvise!

09:44.083 --> 09:45.959
- Ravi, we have to
- warn our family!

09:46.000 --> 09:47.751
I will take care of that.

09:47.792 --> 09:49.126
In the meantime, dig through

09:49.127 --> 09:50.459
the trash and outfit yourself

09:50.500 --> 09:52.042
- with all the foil
- you can find.

09:52.083 --> 09:54.542
The dirtier the better.

09:54.584 --> 09:57.000
For, um... Extra insulation.

09:58.083 --> 09:59.959
Thanks, Ravi. You're

09:59.960 --> 10:01.834
such a good brother.

10:01.876 --> 10:03.584
Outta my way, star nerds!

10:03.585 --> 10:05.292
Coming through, excuse me.

10:07.083 --> 10:08.980
No wonder Luke likes

10:08.981 --> 10:10.876
to prank people.

10:07.083 --> 10:10.876
It is a hoot!

10:10.918 --> 10:12.417
(WHOOPING)

10:18.959 --> 10:20.042
Oh, gross.

10:21.083 --> 10:22.083
Relish.

10:29.542 --> 10:30.918
(BIRD CHIRPING)

10:30.959 --> 10:32.647
(IMITATING BIRD)

10:32.648 --> 10:34.334
Whoa.

10:38.918 --> 10:40.626
Mrs. Chesterfield, are

10:40.627 --> 10:42.334
you here to take me

10:38.918 --> 10:42.334
to the dark side?

10:43.792 --> 10:46.042
It's my sleep apnea mask.

10:46.083 --> 10:48.355
This urchin fell into

10:48.356 --> 10:50.626
my hot tub just as I

10:46.083 --> 10:50.626
was settling into bed.

10:50.667 --> 10:52.043
Some bed. It's shaped

10:52.044 --> 10:53.417
like a heart, rotates,

10:53.459 --> 10:54.751
and plays

10:54.752 --> 10:56.042
the love theme

10:53.459 --> 10:56.042
from Titanic.

10:56.083 --> 10:58.126
Good for you, for making it

10:58.127 --> 11:00.167
into one of the lifeboats.

11:00.209 --> 11:02.313
Just keep your

11:02.314 --> 11:04.417
child infestation from

11:00.209 --> 11:04.417
contaminating my apartment.

11:04.459 --> 11:06.000
- It's affecting
- my beauty sleep.

11:06.042 --> 11:07.709
Clearly.

11:07.751 --> 11:08.751
Ugh!

11:11.584 --> 11:13.252
Emma, where do you

11:13.253 --> 11:14.918
think you're going?

11:14.959 --> 11:17.459
Can't a girl make sure

11:17.460 --> 11:19.959
her nice, sweet neighbor

11:14.959 --> 11:19.959
gets home safely?

11:22.000 --> 11:23.626
- Yeah, even I
- didn't buy that.

11:25.584 --> 11:27.125
(YAWNS)

11:27.167 --> 11:29.143
- So what do you think - they're going
to find - In that mysterious cave?

11:29.167 --> 11:30.563
It must be the shocking

11:30.564 --> 11:31.959
reveal in the finale.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.271
We have to keep going

11:33.272 --> 11:34.542
so we can watch it live

11:34.584 --> 11:36.125
- before we hear
- any spoilers.

11:36.167 --> 11:37.855
I don't know how I'm

11:37.856 --> 11:39.542
going to be able

11:36.167 --> 11:39.542
to stay awake...

11:39.584 --> 11:41.314
(SNORING)

11:41.315 --> 11:43.042
Bertram, stay with me!

11:43.083 --> 11:45.626
Don't go into the night light!

11:45.667 --> 11:47.626
Wait! Stop shaking me.

11:47.627 --> 11:49.584
You're loosening my fillings.

11:49.626 --> 11:51.376
I just have to find

11:51.377 --> 11:53.125
a way to stay up.

11:56.584 --> 11:57.709

11:57.710 --> 11:58.834
more like coffee.

(SCREAMING)

12:03.834 --> 12:05.293
How did you know

12:05.294 --> 12:06.751
that wasn't hot?

12:03.834 --> 12:06.751
I didn't.

12:10.542 --> 12:12.709
(PLAYING INSTRUMENT POORLY)

12:16.918 --> 12:18.418
That sounded nothing

12:18.419 --> 12:19.918
like the national anthem.

12:21.542 --> 12:23.626
(CRYING)

12:23.667 --> 12:25.210
Luke? Why are you covered in

12:25.211 --> 12:26.751
tinfoil? And baba ghanoush?

12:32.626 --> 12:33.751
- (THUD)
- EMMA: Ow!

12:35.876 --> 12:37.688
Oh, someone put

12:37.689 --> 12:39.500
a plant in the elevator?

12:35.876 --> 12:39.500
What a lovely touch.

12:42.125 --> 12:45.125
Luke! What are you doing?

12:45.167 --> 12:46.960
Getting tinfoil for my new

12:46.961 --> 12:48.751
girlfriend, so she doesn't

12:45.167 --> 12:48.751
die when the asteroid hits!

12:48.792 --> 12:50.584
- Okay, well,
- have fun with that.

12:50.626 --> 12:52.105
I'll just be here,

12:52.106 --> 12:53.584
finishing my list.

12:53.626 --> 12:55.313
That's good, Jessie.

12:55.314 --> 12:57.000
You finish that bucket list.

12:59.125 --> 13:00.813
Oh, someone put

13:00.814 --> 13:02.500
a plant in the elevator.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.083
What a lovely touch.

13:07.083 --> 13:08.834
- Hey, what are you...

13:16.356 --> 13:18.042
of your special skills

13:14.667 --> 13:18.042
strangling a walrus?

13:18.083 --> 13:20.167
Put a cork in it, Jessie!

13:22.083 --> 13:23.834
- I really should
- have rented this.

13:25.959 --> 13:27.980
It's here. The season finale.

13:27.981 --> 13:30.000
I can almost taste it.

13:31.167 --> 13:32.563
(SOBBING)

13:32.564 --> 13:33.959
What's wrong?

13:34.042 --> 13:35.084
I need to know

13:35.085 --> 13:36.125
what's in that cave!

13:36.167 --> 13:39.083
And I really need to pee.

13:39.125 --> 13:40.709
I'm wearing a diaper.

13:40.710 --> 13:42.292
Where's your commitment?

13:42.334 --> 13:43.667
Where's your dignity?

13:45.959 --> 13:47.876
- (GROANING)
- Oh, come on!

13:47.918 --> 13:49.480
We already know what happened.

13:49.481 --> 13:51.042
We've been watching

13:47.918 --> 13:51.042
for hours and hours!

13:51.083 --> 13:53.105
I know! My eyes

13:53.106 --> 13:55.125
are so dry, they make

13:51.083 --> 13:55.125
a noise when I blink!

13:55.167 --> 13:56.709
(BOINGING)

14:01.792 --> 14:03.480
Heidi! Quick! Hold that.

14:03.481 --> 14:05.167
Okay, okay, okay.

14:05.209 --> 14:07.167
Luke? What is wrong with you?

14:07.209 --> 14:08.772
I'm not a sandwich

14:08.773 --> 14:10.334
you're saving for later.

14:10.375 --> 14:12.064
Okay, there's no time

14:12.065 --> 14:13.751
to explain, but the

14:10.375 --> 14:13.751
world is going to end!

14:13.792 --> 14:14.856
Not as fast as

14:14.857 --> 14:15.918
this relationship!

14:17.792 --> 14:19.251
Heidi, wait! Don't you

14:19.252 --> 14:20.709
want to live long enough

14:17.792 --> 14:20.709
to help me

14:20.751 --> 14:22.001
lead the resistance

14:22.002 --> 14:23.250
against our lizard overlords?

14:24.292 --> 14:25.959
(ALL LAUGHING)

14:27.751 --> 14:29.230
Looks like your attempt

14:29.231 --> 14:30.709
to steal Heidi from me was...

14:31.709 --> 14:34.167
Foiled!

14:34.209 --> 14:36.105
Oh, dear puns. You always

14:36.106 --> 14:38.000
come through for me

14:34.209 --> 14:38.000
when I need you most.

14:40.083 --> 14:41.418
Wait, what are you

14:41.419 --> 14:42.751
talking about?

14:42.792 --> 14:44.751
Luke, it was all a prank.

14:44.792 --> 14:46.001
I played you like Paganini

14:46.002 --> 14:47.209
played the Stradivarius.

14:47.250 --> 14:48.834
So this whole thing

14:48.835 --> 14:50.417
was a trick?

14:47.250 --> 14:50.417
Correct.

14:50.459 --> 14:51.751
It burns, does it not?

14:53.083 --> 14:54.709
Kinda.

14:54.751 --> 14:55.917
As your brother,

14:55.918 --> 14:57.083
I'm pretty ticked off.

14:57.125 --> 14:58.584
But as a prank master,

14:58.585 --> 15:00.042
I'm super proud!

15:00.083 --> 15:01.083
Props, bro!

15:03.125 --> 15:04.375
Whoa!

15:06.417 --> 15:08.271
So, the asteroid's not

15:08.272 --> 15:10.125
gonna hit Earth?

15:06.417 --> 15:10.125
Hardly.

15:10.167 --> 15:11.605
Look, if you multiply

15:11.606 --> 15:13.042
the trajectory of the asteroid

15:13.083 --> 15:15.063
by the angle of Earth's

15:15.064 --> 15:17.042
rotation, carry the twosie,

15:17.083 --> 15:18.251
the asteroid is actually

15:18.252 --> 15:19.417
going to... (GASPING)

15:19.459 --> 15:21.251
Crash right into Central Park!

15:21.252 --> 15:23.042
Dude, come on.

15:23.083 --> 15:24.938
You're not allowed to trick

15:24.939 --> 15:26.792
me again after I give you

15:23.083 --> 15:26.792
the combo handshake, bro-hug.

15:26.834 --> 15:28.000
That's a prank foul!

15:29.083 --> 15:31.334
This is no prank!

15:31.375 --> 15:32.605
When was the last time I made

15:32.606 --> 15:33.834
a mathematical error?

15:35.167 --> 15:37.022
Oh, no, we're doomed!

15:37.023 --> 15:38.876
Good thing we're both

15:35.167 --> 15:38.876
wearing tinfoil.

15:38.918 --> 15:40.834
You dolt!

15:40.876 --> 15:42.960
The asteroid is going

15:42.961 --> 15:45.042
to blow us into

15:40.876 --> 15:45.042
a million pieces!

15:45.083 --> 15:46.918
The foil will do nothing

15:46.919 --> 15:48.751
but ensure our remains

15:45.083 --> 15:48.751
are cooked evenly!

15:54.250 --> 15:56.064
We have to warn everyone

15:56.065 --> 15:57.876
in the park about the

15:54.250 --> 15:57.876
asteroid hurtling towards us!

15:57.918 --> 15:59.980
Not just the park.

15:59.981 --> 16:02.042
The blast radius includes

15:57.918 --> 16:02.042
all of Manhattan!

16:02.083 --> 16:04.083
And, somewhat less

16:04.084 --> 16:06.083
importantly, Queens.

16:06.125 --> 16:07.563
As long as it doesn't hit

16:07.564 --> 16:09.000
the Bronx or Yankee Stadium.

16:10.834 --> 16:12.751
- Okay, we can warn
- the whole city.

16:15.542 --> 16:17.731
Ravi, do you know how to

16:17.732 --> 16:19.918
access a live satellite feed?

16:19.959 --> 16:21.167
Uh, like duh.

No! Stop!

16:32.959 --> 16:36.500
the dishes anymore.

16:39.167 --> 16:42.042
That's it, lassie.

16:44.564 --> 16:47.042
the ceiling with this broom

If you keep doing that,

16:48.523 --> 16:49.959
it's never going to fly again.

16:51.167 --> 16:52.667
How dare you!

16:52.709 --> 16:54.105
Let's just see

16:54.106 --> 16:55.500
how sassy you are

16:52.709 --> 16:55.500
when the fuzz arrives.

16:55.542 --> 16:56.793
Is that what you call

16:56.794 --> 16:58.042
your flying monkeys?

16:58.083 --> 16:59.542
That's what I call the police.

16:59.543 --> 17:01.000
The police?

17:01.042 --> 17:03.042
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mrs. Chesterfield, please!

17:03.083 --> 17:05.041
- You have no idea the
- kind of night I've had.

17:05.083 --> 17:06.771
I've failed at juggling, plate

17:06.772 --> 17:08.459
spinning, music, bird calls

17:08.500 --> 17:10.271
and I even burned

17:10.272 --> 17:12.041
the taquitos I

17:08.500 --> 17:12.041
made as a snack.

17:12.083 --> 17:13.501
My audition is tomorrow

17:13.502 --> 17:14.917
and the only thing

17:12.083 --> 17:14.917
I've managed to do

17:14.959 --> 17:16.001
is get a bad case

17:16.002 --> 17:17.041
of sousaphone shoulder.

17:17.083 --> 17:19.041
I've never even heard of that.

17:19.042 --> 17:21.000
Neither had the urgent

17:17.083 --> 17:21.000
care nurse I called.

17:21.041 --> 17:23.876
She was very dismissive.

17:23.917 --> 17:25.980
So please, please just

17:25.981 --> 17:28.041
call off the police.

17:23.917 --> 17:28.041
Hmm. No can do.

17:28.083 --> 17:29.188
No, it's time you

17:29.189 --> 17:30.292

- what's in the cave!

Our show!

17:53.083 --> 17:55.083
Hey, what's wrong?

17:55.125 --> 17:56.604
Is there some sort of

17:56.605 --> 17:58.083
competition in this house

17:55.125 --> 17:58.083
to see who can be the loudest?

Ooh, or the hunkiest?

Okay, we are live.

Under no circumstances

18:37.543 --> 18:39.000

We are all doomed!
