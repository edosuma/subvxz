WEBVTT

00:01.359 --> 00:03.362
- Last season on
Being Human,

00:03.400 --> 00:05.027
(Growling)

00:05.070 --> 00:06.333
- Once a month,
I'm a killer.

00:06.370 --> 00:09.408
- I've been trying
to be clean for a decade.

00:09.440 --> 00:11.101
- Are you serious?
- About what?

00:11.140 --> 00:12.437
- Being normal?

00:12.480 --> 00:14.778
- I'm Sally. Hi!
A door?

00:14.810 --> 00:16.471
- The portal that
takes you beyond

00:16.510 --> 00:17.443
when it's time to mosey.

00:17.480 --> 00:19.619
- Don't miss it
"cause of me.

00:19.650 --> 00:20.515
- I'm stuck here.

00:20.550 --> 00:23.349
- This is your secret?
- Aaah!

00:23.390 --> 00:24.312
- Josh?

00:24.350 --> 00:25.385
There's no cure.

00:25.420 --> 00:27.889
And just a scratch was enough.

00:30.130 --> 00:34.556
- You are the leader now.
She wants to meet you.

00:34.600 --> 00:36.864
- So I guess we should've
started slower

00:36.900 --> 00:38.925
with the whole
being-normal thing, huh?

00:41.940 --> 00:43.260
(Honking)

00:51.810 --> 00:54.347
** T've been waiting

00:54.380 --> 00:56.382
* Waiting and wishing

00:56.420 --> 00:58.411
* Lying and cheating

00:58.450 --> 01:02.455
* Hoping you'll come
alive for me tonight, babe

01:02.490 --> 01:05.755
* Hope I come alive *

01:13.540 --> 01:15.360
(Grunting)

01:15.400 --> 01:16.470
- Aw!

01:16.510 --> 01:18.433
I can't do this, man!

01:18.470 --> 01:22.703
- No, you can. It just takes
a little getting use to.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.809
(Siren in distance)

01:24.850 --> 01:27.319
So much killing.

01:27.350 --> 01:29.842
With the cleanup crews
and the system,

01:29.890 --> 01:31.619
we are all at risk
of exposure.

01:31.650 --> 01:35.018
- What do you want us to do?
We're feeling all alone.

01:35.060 --> 01:36.130
- I'm trying to
help with that.

01:36.160 --> 01:38.254
- Really? 'Cause
none of us know

01:38.290 --> 01:39.428
what the hell
we're doing out here.

01:39.460 --> 01:42.566
- Tommy, I've only been
at this a few weeks!

01:42.600 --> 01:45.661
- Nobody comes into
this world alone.

01:45.700 --> 01:47.190
That's what
Bishop told us,

01:47.240 --> 01:49.538
right before you killed him.

01:49.570 --> 01:53.507
Oh, Aidan, we were promised
a new kind of family.

01:53.540 --> 01:56.407
I left my wife, my kids

01:56.450 --> 01:59.101
for what?
For this?

02:00.920 --> 02:03.639
You gotta
step up, man.

02:03.690 --> 02:08.685
You gotta step up and make this right.
- I can get you more of this.

02:12.260 --> 02:14.820
Look, you know
where I work, right?

02:14.860 --> 02:19.229
- Yeah.
- Come by tomorrow. I'll see what I can do.

02:19.270 --> 02:21.136
- Who's she?

02:22.170 --> 02:23.638
- What?

02:23.670 --> 02:27.106
- I keep hearing:
"She's coming."

02:27.140 --> 02:28.778
"She's coming."

02:28.810 --> 02:30.676
What the hell
does that mean?

02:32.620 --> 02:34.076
- I'll tell you tomorrow.

02:35.420 --> 02:37.843
"Freedom" is just pretty way

02:37.890 --> 02:40.109
of saying that you've gone
off the grid.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.528
For better or for worse,
you're out of options.

02:45.830 --> 02:49.368
But we call it "Freedom"
We write songs about it.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.129
You probably crank them
in your car,

02:51.170 --> 02:53.662
and never thought about it
much.

02:56.240 --> 02:58.834
Some people think
it's exhilarating

02:58.870 --> 03:02.500
not having your future
mapped out.

03:08.980 --> 03:12.689
Others start to drown
in all that nothing.

03:15.360 --> 03:16.850
Maybe you'll enjoy
for a moment

03:16.890 --> 03:21.225
the purity of doing
what you want, when you want.

03:23.600 --> 03:27.138
Beer for breakfast,
sex in the afternoon.

03:27.170 --> 03:30.299
But obligations sneak up...

03:30.340 --> 03:34.299
duty, moral code.

03:34.340 --> 03:37.674
Some of us are wired to put
ourselves back into cages.

03:37.710 --> 03:42.944
Freedom is just that moment of
calm before the dread sets in.

03:46.020 --> 03:48.011
(Man talking, indistinct)

03:49.690 --> 03:52.159
- Aidan, we need blood.

03:52.190 --> 03:53.260
We need the blood.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.449
- Aidan, please!

03:54.500 --> 03:57.299
- I need my blood.
(All talking)

03:57.330 --> 03:58.422
- It's OK.
Just don't...

03:58.470 --> 04:01.770
Because no matter what
you freed yourself from,

04:01.800 --> 04:04.701
you only get so far
down the open road,

04:04.740 --> 04:06.799
car windows down,
music blasting,

04:06.840 --> 04:09.946
before you're forced
to take a turn,

04:09.980 --> 04:11.539
make a choice

04:11.580 --> 04:15.471
and sentence yourself
to the next adventure.

04:35.940 --> 04:38.307
(Sighing)

04:38.340 --> 04:39.262
- Hmm...

04:39.310 --> 04:40.675
- Hmm...

04:43.150 --> 04:45.175
(Birds chirping)

04:53.120 --> 04:54.815
You OK?

04:54.860 --> 04:56.589
- Yeah, I just...

04:57.390 --> 04:58.653
(Sighing)

04:58.690 --> 05:01.352
- Yeah, right,
and the doctor said...

05:01.400 --> 05:04.370
- She said 4 weeks.
- Four weeks.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.334
- And yeah, it's...

05:06.370 --> 05:10.136
It's been about a month
since that night...

05:10.170 --> 05:12.264
so I should be fine.

05:19.850 --> 05:21.375
- Oh, I missed
your skin.

05:21.420 --> 05:23.343
- Uh...

05:24.320 --> 05:25.446
You can't miss that.

05:25.490 --> 05:27.811
- I missed
all of it.

05:28.920 --> 05:31.150
(Moaning)

05:31.190 --> 05:33.022
(Chuckling)

05:33.060 --> 05:36.428
- You are a morning person!

05:36.470 --> 05:39.064
- Yeah, yeah. I know.
I'm--I'm sorry.

05:40.640 --> 05:43.405
It's the wolf.
It's, um...

05:43.440 --> 05:46.068
If I may refer to it
in the 3rd person.

05:46.110 --> 05:47.771
I just get a little...

05:47.810 --> 05:48.800
- So I see.

05:48.840 --> 05:50.171
- Yeah.

05:50.210 --> 05:51.871
- What else
do you feel?

05:52.820 --> 05:55.016
What's it like?

05:55.050 --> 06:00.887
- Nora, you saw it.
- Yeah, I know, I know, but we haven't talked about it.

06:00.920 --> 06:03.127
We haven't talked
about any of it.

06:03.160 --> 06:05.857
(Sighing)
- OK, um...

06:09.060 --> 06:12.769
The couple days before, uh...

06:12.800 --> 06:15.064
your senses
get heightened.

06:16.340 --> 06:18.160
It's like after a rainstorm.

06:18.210 --> 06:22.101
The wind changes direction
and you notice things.

06:22.140 --> 06:24.746
And taste is like...

06:24.780 --> 06:29.047
First I want a burger
and then I'm like:

06:29.080 --> 06:33.187
<i>"Screw the frickin' burger. "I
want a mound of raw steak."</i>

06:33.220 --> 06:35.279
(Sighing)

06:37.230 --> 06:39.324
Not a mound, but...

06:42.360 --> 06:44.260
You don't have to do this.

06:44.300 --> 06:46.564
You don't have to take
all this on right now.

06:46.600 --> 06:51.333
I mean, the whole point
of this was not to do this.

06:51.370 --> 06:53.907
- The point of what?

06:53.940 --> 06:55.408
- An apartment.

06:55.440 --> 06:57.477
A job, um...

06:59.050 --> 07:01.269
a girlfriend who's
too good for me.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.743
(Chuckling)

07:04.720 --> 07:07.451
Normalcy.

07:07.490 --> 07:10.289
That's the
whole point.

07:13.800 --> 07:16.428
(Breathing unevenly)

07:17.370 --> 07:19.225
(Grunting)

07:21.870 --> 07:22.962
- Sally, how 'bout I--

07:23.010 --> 07:25.229
- I can do it!
- Or your way's good.

07:25.270 --> 07:28.274
- Ah!
(Sighing)

07:28.310 --> 07:31.245
How important is it really
that the blood is warm?

07:31.280 --> 07:33.749
- He had a rough night.
I'll just--

07:33.780 --> 07:39.287
So, there were an unusual amount
of tweaky-looking vampires

07:39.320 --> 07:41.414
scuffling around
the doorstep last night.

07:41.460 --> 07:44.657
- And I took care of them.
It's temporary.

07:44.690 --> 07:46.727
- A month is a little long
to be temporary.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.194
- Do you want coffee?
I can pour coffee.

07:48.230 --> 07:52.599
- I do want coffee, Sally,
but I want it in my mug.

07:52.640 --> 07:53.766
(Muttering)

07:53.800 --> 07:54.995
I'm sorry, sorry.

07:56.610 --> 07:59.875
So, I thought
you killing Bishop

07:59.910 --> 08:01.969
was wiping
the slate clean.

08:02.010 --> 08:03.978
- Yeah, well, because
I killed Bishop,

08:04.010 --> 08:06.775
it's my responsibility
to control the chaos.

08:06.820 --> 08:07.969
- Because...

08:08.020 --> 08:11.115
- What? You want one of the
doorstep tweakers doing it?

08:11.150 --> 08:15.189
I want to contain this,
survive this quietly,

08:15.220 --> 08:16.949
and the least I can do
is set an example

08:16.990 --> 08:20.893
of what I do believe which
is normalcy, civility,

08:20.930 --> 08:25.128
living our lives without
taking others. (Cup breaking)

08:27.300 --> 08:29.860
- Sorry.
(Sighing)

08:29.910 --> 08:32.265
(Groans)
- Nice work.

08:32.309 --> 08:35.280
- Look, Josh, Mother's coming
to meet with me.

08:35.309 --> 08:37.244
- So, that is happening?

08:37.280 --> 08:39.578
Because it's been weeks
since we heard anything,

08:39.620 --> 08:40.769
and I was just
thinking maybe

08:40.820 --> 08:43.187
she was on a cruise
in, like, Alaska.

08:43.220 --> 08:44.779
It's really nice
this time of year.

08:44.820 --> 08:46.549
- When you live forever,
a few weeks is nothing.

08:46.590 --> 08:48.388
Look, when mother gets here,

08:48.420 --> 08:50.957
she will determine the
proper order and that's that

08:50.990 --> 08:55.154
and not even the council
can go against her word.

08:57.830 --> 09:01.266
It's all good!
- If there could be a lot less

09:01.300 --> 09:04.065
"Mother will determine
the proper blah, blah, blah"

09:04.110 --> 09:07.899
and--and floating, broken coffee
mugs when Nora comes down here,

09:07.940 --> 09:09.999
that would be awesome.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.917
- OK, come one.
I mean, she knows I'm here.

09:12.950 --> 09:14.679
She saw Aidan not die.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.916
She saw you wolf out.

09:16.950 --> 09:19.112
You know, in the words
of Don Aidan,

09:19.150 --> 09:21.050
it's all good.

09:21.090 --> 09:23.081
- No, it's not.

09:23.130 --> 09:25.622
- Is Sally here?

09:25.660 --> 09:28.652
- She is.

09:28.700 --> 09:31.761
What's that? I found it in
the bathroom trash can.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.666
Her high-school
reunion is today.

09:33.700 --> 09:34.963
Does she even know?

09:35.000 --> 09:35.831
- Yes, she knows.

09:35.870 --> 09:37.406
She found it in the mail,

09:37.440 --> 09:43.277
and expended a lot of energy trying
to hide it in the trash. But thanks, Nora!

09:43.310 --> 09:44.948
- So you're not going?

09:44.980 --> 09:50.817
- What's the point?
- Um, you can openly stare at people.

09:50.850 --> 09:52.784
- Oh!
- Yeah.

09:52.820 --> 09:55.084
She's wondering
why she should go.

09:55.120 --> 09:57.521
- Oh! You have to go.

09:57.560 --> 10:00.996
It's like going to
your own funeral,

10:01.030 --> 10:03.920
only way... better.

10:03.970 --> 10:07.338
- OK, reunions are all
about proving your success.

10:07.370 --> 10:08.895
Right? What am I proving?

10:08.940 --> 10:10.738
That I can sometimes
hold a spoon?

10:10.770 --> 10:12.033
I can't.
I can't.

10:12.070 --> 10:13.731
Too depressing.
Can't do it.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.805
- She has very
valid reservations.

10:15.840 --> 10:17.148
- Well, she--

10:17.180 --> 10:20.218
You will only be seen
in the best light.

10:20.250 --> 10:22.344
Everyone there will
be talking about you.

10:22.380 --> 10:24.849
"She was so young,
so beautiful."

10:24.890 --> 10:25.914
- Oh, come on.

10:25.950 --> 10:27.588
- It's true.

10:29.460 --> 10:31.189
- Well, I gotta go
look at my hair.

10:31.230 --> 10:35.189
- You can't change your hair.
- I can still look at it!

10:35.230 --> 10:37.699
- Sally, I promise you
that you're way better off

10:37.730 --> 10:40.563
than everyone who's gonna be
starving themselves this week.

10:42.140 --> 10:43.835
Am I right, girlfriend?

10:48.940 --> 10:51.409
She's gone, isn't she?
- Yeah.

10:51.450 --> 10:52.747
- She's considering
her hair.

10:52.780 --> 10:53.918
- Right.

10:53.950 --> 10:55.748
- Hey, so, we should
get to work.

10:55.780 --> 10:56.986
Nora, you wanna...

10:57.020 --> 10:58.317
- I'm not on till 1:00.

10:58.350 --> 10:59.818
- That's right.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.919
Bye.
- Bye.

11:01.960 --> 11:03.223
- See you
before I turn.

11:03.260 --> 11:04.728
- I'll see you soon.

11:05.930 --> 11:07.921
(Sighing)

11:07.960 --> 11:09.689
(Scoffing)

11:25.210 --> 11:27.770
(Breathing unevenly)

11:27.820 --> 11:30.790
(Siren)

11:30.820 --> 11:33.357
- OK, Mr. Sims, showtime!

11:33.390 --> 11:36.360
The changing of the linens.

11:37.760 --> 11:39.751
Mr. Sims?

11:47.500 --> 11:48.831
Oh my god!

11:48.870 --> 11:50.133
(Panting)

11:50.170 --> 11:51.729
- I know you.

11:51.770 --> 11:53.374
You live with Aidan.

11:53.410 --> 11:57.404
You should probably
page him, stat.

12:05.520 --> 12:08.114
- Oh, would you mind--
Uh, could you--

12:08.160 --> 12:10.219
- Standing watch?
Be your lookout?

12:10.260 --> 12:12.422
I don't know, sure!
Why would I-- Why would I mind?

12:12.460 --> 12:14.554
I woke up this morning
with such a void in my life,

12:14.600 --> 12:18.389
I am "jonesing" to be
an accessory to murder.

12:18.430 --> 12:20.239
Let's do this.

12:24.140 --> 12:26.302
(Sighing)

12:28.110 --> 12:29.908
- I'm so sorry.

12:29.950 --> 12:33.944
I came to meet you. I was
walking down the hall. It's just--

12:33.980 --> 12:35.379
It's this place.

12:35.420 --> 12:36.569
It's everywhere.

12:36.620 --> 12:38.247
- No, it's OK.
I know.

12:38.290 --> 12:39.610
(Groaning)

12:39.650 --> 12:42.620
You idiot!
I was trying to help you.

12:42.660 --> 12:44.150
- I was starving!

12:44.190 --> 12:47.990
I couldn't wait for that
bag piss you call food!

12:49.660 --> 12:53.790
What's the point of staying in the
shadows and keeping a low profile

12:53.840 --> 12:54.762
when she's just gonna
kill us anyway?

12:54.800 --> 12:56.131
- What?

12:56.170 --> 12:59.003
- "The culling." That's
what they're calling it.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.179
Bishop built up
his illegal army

13:01.210 --> 13:03.008
and Mother's just
gonna kill us all

13:03.050 --> 13:04.575
to protect the
other families

13:04.610 --> 13:06.874
or some other
vampire political crap.

13:06.920 --> 13:11.016
Listen, I cannot
die again.

13:11.050 --> 13:13.087
You hear me?
I can't.

13:13.120 --> 13:17.626
- And you're not gonna.
Look, I told you...

13:17.660 --> 13:19.685
I'm doing everything
that I can.

13:23.770 --> 13:25.420
- (Woman):
Adele, come here!

13:25.470 --> 13:27.029
(Talking, indistinct)

13:29.740 --> 13:31.401
- Every time [ start
getting weepy,

13:31.440 --> 13:35.035
I remember Van Hogan "pantsing"
me in the cafeteria.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.139
Yeah, and then I remember
high school sucked.

13:37.180 --> 13:39.979
- Stevie Atkins?
Oh my god!

13:40.020 --> 13:42.409
Ha! I thought--
I thought you were--

13:42.450 --> 13:45.044
- You thought I was dead?
Good, we're gonna go with that.

13:45.090 --> 13:46.546
- You know
what I mean.

13:46.590 --> 13:49.480
I gotta say, I'm surprised
you're haunting high school.

13:49.520 --> 13:51.784
- Why? 'Cause I killed
myself to get out of here?

13:51.830 --> 13:54.049
-Yes,
- It's compulsively interesting.

13:54.100 --> 13:56.728
And plus, they totally
glamourize my suicide.

13:56.760 --> 13:57.761
It's a great message
for the kids.

13:57.800 --> 13:59.120
- Right, well,
how pissed are you

13:59.170 --> 14:01.264
that I'm stealing the
spotlight this year?

14:01.300 --> 14:04.429
Murdered, my friend,
by my fianc.

14:04.470 --> 14:06.666
- Wow, that--that's cold.
- Mm-hmm.

14:06.710 --> 14:08.633
- You know who bit it
a few months ago?

14:08.680 --> 14:10.705
- Who?
- Diane Alcott.

14:12.150 --> 14:13.174
- Hmm!

14:14.720 --> 14:19.214
What, she like, uh, she get crushed
under the weight of her pageant tiara?

14:19.250 --> 14:21.856
Did her lustrous hair
smother her in her sleep?

14:21.890 --> 14:24.382
Did her boobs creep up

14:24.430 --> 14:27.821
and, you know, punch her
in the face or something, hmm?

14:27.860 --> 14:29.521
- Malaria.

14:30.470 --> 14:33.735
She was a Goodwill
Ambassador in Africa.

14:33.770 --> 14:35.898
- Malaria.

14:37.110 --> 14:40.000
Well, that's just stupid.
They have drugs for that.

14:43.450 --> 14:45.077
- Look, you don't
have to do this.

14:45.110 --> 14:46.646
- You don't have
to do this.

14:46.680 --> 14:47.875
Excuse me.

14:47.920 --> 14:51.413
I thought you said that there
were people that were vampires

14:51.450 --> 14:53.782
that you could call
who clean stuff like this up,

14:53.820 --> 14:58.189
like the Merry Maids who
help make gunk disappear.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.152
- Yeah. There are.

14:59.190 --> 15:01.249
There were,
but when I killed Bishop,

15:01.300 --> 15:03.291
the institutions, the levers
that he used to control,

15:03.330 --> 15:05.424
this is all fractured now
and now it's all on me.

15:05.470 --> 15:07.939
I didn't ask for it. I don't
want it, but there it is.

15:07.970 --> 15:10.940
I have to make it disappear.
- But I have Nora.

15:13.480 --> 15:14.675
And med school.

15:14.710 --> 15:15.973
<i>- I know.</i>

15:16.010 --> 15:17.569
- It's just too many things

15:17.610 --> 15:19.942
I'm trying to accomplish
that don't involve--

15:19.980 --> 15:21.414
<i>- I know.</i>

15:21.450 --> 15:22.645
It's OK.

15:23.650 --> 15:25.584

15:29.190 --> 15:31.557
(* Woman singing pop ballad

15:31.590 --> 15:33.649
- Wow, Brian,
what happened to you?

15:33.700 --> 15:36.453
- Here's the problem
with reunions:

15:36.500 --> 15:38.093
You have the girls
who look better.

15:38.130 --> 15:39.768
You have the guys
who look worse,

15:39.800 --> 15:42.189
but the girls remember
them as they used to be.

15:42.240 --> 15:43.799
Next, she's calling
her friend

15:43.840 --> 15:45.660
to pick her up
in front of his hotel

15:45.710 --> 15:48.736
after they've just had awkward,
half-chub reunion sex,

15:48.780 --> 15:50.145
and all does
not end well.

15:50.180 --> 15:53.070
- You know, you are far
too wise to look this young.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.612
(* Woman singing

15:55.650 --> 15:57.539
(Woman shushing)

15:57.590 --> 15:59.649
- Oh, here we go.
- Ah!

15:59.690 --> 16:00.657
(All exclaiming)

16:00.690 --> 16:01.953
- Stevie!

16:01.990 --> 16:02.957
- Classic.

16:06.330 --> 16:07.297
(All exclaiming)

16:07.330 --> 16:08.354
- Sally!

16:09.860 --> 16:11.862
- She's so
beautiful!

16:14.400 --> 16:17.370
- I miss her so much.
- Me too.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.708
(All exclaiming)

16:21.440 --> 16:22.635
- Oh, come on.

16:22.680 --> 16:23.772
- Bitter much?

16:23.810 --> 16:25.505
- Please.

16:25.550 --> 16:28.941
I just never saw the point
in Diane Alcott.

16:28.980 --> 16:33.816
- Yeah, what is the point in a body like that anyway? Honestly!
- You've liked her?

16:35.820 --> 16:37.686
- Isn't it sweet?

16:37.730 --> 16:40.654
It's amazing how you
can touch someone's life

16:40.700 --> 16:42.259
without ever really
knowing them, right?

16:42.300 --> 16:43.859
- Yeah...

16:43.900 --> 16:46.164
- Did you guys
go here too?

16:46.200 --> 16:47.690
- We were in your class.

16:47.740 --> 16:50.437
- But I killed
myself in junior year,

16:50.470 --> 16:53.371
so it's cool if you
don't re--remember me.

16:53.410 --> 16:55.299
- Junior year was
pretty stressful.

16:55.340 --> 16:58.105
Well, I'm Diane.

17:17.430 --> 17:18.795
(Sighing)

17:20.500 --> 17:22.468
- Hegeman.

17:23.869 --> 17:26.305
I wasn't
expecting you.

17:26.339 --> 17:27.898
- Of course
we're all here.

17:29.080 --> 17:30.639
- The council?

17:34.080 --> 17:36.572
- When you told me
that she wanted to see me,

17:36.620 --> 17:41.615
I guess I was expecting more of a
dialogue, a discussion, not a spectacle.

17:41.660 --> 17:44.982
- Validation. She's here
to give you Boston.

17:45.030 --> 17:47.021
This is the
traditional way.

17:47.060 --> 17:48.221
- I just--

17:48.260 --> 17:51.093
Things haven't exactly gone
smoothly over the last month.

17:51.130 --> 17:52.097
I have questions.

17:52.130 --> 17:54.792
- No, you don't.
You have only answers.

17:54.840 --> 17:58.367
When she asks you
to accept, you say yes.

17:58.410 --> 18:02.836
That is all you say.
That is all that is ever said.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.974
Tradition, Aidan.

18:29.170 --> 18:30.808
(Footsteps)

18:54.500 --> 18:56.252
- My condolences.

18:58.030 --> 19:00.237
Bishop.

19:00.270 --> 19:02.693
I know you two were close.

19:02.740 --> 19:04.105
- Thank you.

19:05.110 --> 19:07.772
- Do you speak on behalf
of the council, Hegeman?

19:07.810 --> 19:11.269
- Only to reiterate that
Aidan has our full backing.

19:11.310 --> 19:16.180
Along with yours, it would,
we believe, confer upon him

19:16.220 --> 19:18.712
the upmost legitimacy
in Boston.

19:18.750 --> 19:20.479
- Hmm...

19:22.520 --> 19:24.659
And Hegeman...

19:24.690 --> 19:27.489
Please, sit.

19:28.860 --> 19:33.229
Those that Bishop turned,
the illegitimate ones,

19:33.270 --> 19:35.295
what is to become
of them?

19:35.340 --> 19:37.138
- All that they
deserve, Mother.

19:37.170 --> 19:40.731
They were turned in blatant
violation of our agreement.

19:40.780 --> 19:43.545
Naturally,
they will be culled.

19:43.580 --> 19:45.139
- And you, Aidan.

19:45.180 --> 19:49.174
Do you feel the same
about Bishop's orphans?

19:49.220 --> 19:51.279
- I think...

19:52.850 --> 19:57.583
I think many are
confused, scared,

19:57.630 --> 20:00.349
not sure what they did
to be singled out.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.051
- Your recommendation?

20:04.530 --> 20:06.089
- Mercy.

20:06.130 --> 20:10.761
We must be careful not to paint
them with the same brush

20:10.810 --> 20:12.460
that we've painted
Bishop with.

20:12.510 --> 20:15.707
It was his ambition
that was the enemy,

20:15.740 --> 20:17.469
not those he turned,

20:17.510 --> 20:22.175
many of which could prove
extremely useful.

20:24.290 --> 20:27.817
- No. They'll be culled.

20:33.460 --> 20:37.419
We've gathered here to confirm
the best vampire to lead Boston.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.529
And so we shall.

20:40.540 --> 20:43.532
That person is my daughter.

20:44.910 --> 20:47.402
- And she's...

20:47.440 --> 20:49.169
Is she well?

20:49.210 --> 20:51.247
- Very.

20:52.610 --> 20:55.819
- I think what
he means is...

20:55.850 --> 20:58.888
Are you sure it wouldn't be
too much for her,

20:58.920 --> 21:01.252
asking her to return
to this place?

21:01.290 --> 21:03.213
- Boston?

21:03.260 --> 21:05.854
- Here, this hotel.

21:05.890 --> 21:09.292
One wonders if the memories
of what she did...

21:10.600 --> 21:13.865
might be too overwhelming.

21:13.900 --> 21:16.870
- This is exactly where
she needs to be.

21:17.970 --> 21:20.871
And she will have the best
of stewards to guide her.

21:20.910 --> 21:22.332
Aidan.

21:24.250 --> 21:25.069
- Excuse me?

21:25.110 --> 21:27.442
- You will be
my daughter's second.

21:27.480 --> 21:30.780
You will answer her every
question, her every need.

21:30.820 --> 21:32.288
You will stand behind her

21:32.320 --> 21:35.210
as she brings Boston fully
under her control.

21:35.260 --> 21:37.627
In return,

21:37.660 --> 21:41.722
I will overlook
your peccadilloes, your heresy,

21:41.760 --> 21:44.400
and upon her success,

21:44.430 --> 21:50.460
I would be willing to grant you
true release from all this.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.660
Is that something
that would interest you?

21:52.710 --> 21:54.678
Freedom?

21:59.250 --> 22:00.809
(Sighing)

22:11.260 --> 22:13.228
- Is that your secret?

22:13.260 --> 22:15.319
- I'm sorry?

22:15.360 --> 22:17.863
- You're skinny because
you eat raw meat?

22:17.900 --> 22:20.267
What the hell
diet is that?

22:20.300 --> 22:23.668
- Um, it's actually
a "paleo” thing.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.007
Have you heard
of those guys?

22:25.040 --> 22:26.963
You know,
you eat like cavemen,

22:27.010 --> 22:29.900
run like you're being
chased by a dinosaur.

22:29.940 --> 22:32.875
Yeah, it's--it's
a lot of raw meat.

22:32.910 --> 22:36.471
And, uh, bamboo...

22:36.520 --> 22:37.885
- I know I'm a nurse,

22:37.920 --> 22:41.254
but wouldn't diet pills
be so much easier?

22:41.290 --> 22:42.712
(Sighing)

22:42.760 --> 22:44.455
<i>- I know.</i>

22:44.490 --> 22:46.549
This is disgusting.

22:46.590 --> 22:47.898
Can I have a chip?

22:47.930 --> 22:49.898
- Ha! Thank God!
You're human.

22:49.930 --> 22:51.295
(Laughing)

22:51.330 --> 22:52.627
- Yeah.

22:52.670 --> 22:53.865
Mmm!

22:55.870 --> 22:57.736
- Do you ever
regret ending it

22:57.770 --> 22:59.932
before you knew
what was gonna happen?

23:01.410 --> 23:02.832
You were 16.

23:02.880 --> 23:05.747
- I didn't really
think it through.

23:05.780 --> 23:10.980
I mean, I did, enough
to get the pills, but...

23:11.020 --> 23:15.685
You know, part of me
always thought, you know:

23:15.720 --> 23:18.030
"Someone's gonna stop me.
This can't actually work."

23:18.060 --> 23:20.381
- Oh, Stevie.

23:21.630 --> 23:23.826
And what about
your door?

23:23.870 --> 23:26.919
Moving on? I mean, that's
something to look forward to.

23:26.970 --> 23:29.530
- Yeah, maybe for you.

23:29.570 --> 23:31.299
It's kind of
a known known,

23:31.340 --> 23:34.833
if you off yourself,
no door.

23:34.880 --> 23:36.405
- Tell me about it.

23:37.410 --> 23:39.048
I saw my door.

23:39.080 --> 23:40.741
Missed it.

23:40.780 --> 23:42.919
- What happened?

23:42.950 --> 23:47.888
- You know,
life, afterlife...

23:47.920 --> 23:49.058
Yeah.

23:49.090 --> 23:51.024
- You ever
try sleeping,

23:51.060 --> 23:53.051
just block it out?

23:53.090 --> 23:54.922
- Ha! I wish.

23:57.730 --> 23:59.027
Wait...

24:00.030 --> 24:01.839
Can we even do that?

24:01.870 --> 24:03.599
- We can if
we want to.

24:03.640 --> 24:07.099
I mean, it just kind of helps
speed up the endless nothing,

24:07.140 --> 24:08.539
and I actually dream,

24:08.580 --> 24:09.900
and the dreams are great.

24:09.940 --> 24:11.806
It's kind of like living,

24:11.850 --> 24:14.911
except everything
turns out right.

24:14.950 --> 24:16.918
(Sniffs)

24:16.950 --> 24:20.079
- Things can still
turn out right for you.

24:20.120 --> 24:22.714
- Trying to get
a party started?

24:22.760 --> 24:25.627
- No, not me.

24:26.590 --> 24:28.820
Diane Alcott.

24:30.870 --> 24:32.565

24:32.600 --> 24:33.567
(Siren)

24:33.600 --> 24:35.694
- Hey.

24:35.740 --> 24:37.708
- Hi.
(Clearing throat)

24:38.740 --> 24:40.037
- So...

24:41.110 --> 24:44.603
What time do
you actually...

24:44.650 --> 24:45.674
turn?

24:45.710 --> 24:47.371
- Why are you asking?

24:47.410 --> 24:49.139
- Well, I wanna
pick you up.

24:49.180 --> 24:50.841
I'll take you
to the woods.

24:50.890 --> 24:53.518
It's good, right?
That I should be with you?

24:53.560 --> 24:55.380
So what time?

24:57.790 --> 24:59.724
- Yeah, let's not
do that.

24:59.760 --> 25:02.730
- Excuse me?
- I just don't think it's, um...

25:02.760 --> 25:04.467
- I've seen it!

25:04.500 --> 25:06.719
Wasn't that what
you were scared of?

25:06.770 --> 25:08.795
It's out there, Josh.
We're past that.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.832
- We're not past it.
It's all we ever talk about.

25:11.870 --> 25:14.805
- No, actually, we've talked
about anything else

25:14.840 --> 25:16.433
for the last 30 days.

25:16.480 --> 25:19.108
Only this morning did I start
asking you questions,

25:19.150 --> 25:22.074
really, finally,
about this.

25:22.120 --> 25:24.714
- Yeah, and you saw it.
You've seen it.

25:24.750 --> 25:26.912
So what else do
you want to know?

25:26.950 --> 25:29.453
- I wanna know
how you feel,

25:29.490 --> 25:31.128
if you're scared, if--

25:31.160 --> 25:33.026
I don't know.
If you like it.

25:33.060 --> 25:34.721
- Of course
I don't like it.

25:34.760 --> 25:36.956
- I just wanna know you.
- You do!

25:39.830 --> 25:41.832
I'm sorry.

25:42.970 --> 25:47.259
You know the version of me
that I wanted you to know.

25:47.310 --> 25:50.701
And now, unfortunately,
you know the rest.

25:53.920 --> 25:55.775
I'm just gonna
go alone tonight.

25:55.820 --> 25:58.846
OK? We can talk
about all this later.

25:58.890 --> 26:00.654
- Sure.

26:00.690 --> 26:03.853
Let's put it off
for another month.

26:03.890 --> 26:05.756
- Nora, please. Nora!

26:20.040 --> 26:23.999
- We've known each other
far too long, Hegeman.

26:24.050 --> 26:25.802
- Far too long.

26:25.850 --> 26:28.547
- Maybe you can
tell me, then,

26:28.580 --> 26:32.244
why is it the young never
seem to want what we want?

26:36.890 --> 26:39.825
- Your daughter
will succeed, Mother,

26:39.860 --> 26:41.624
in time.

26:41.660 --> 26:45.790
You blame yourself far too much
for her shortcomings.

26:45.830 --> 26:47.730
- You're wrong.

26:48.770 --> 26:51.705
It's always the
mother's fault.

26:56.110 --> 26:59.671
A vampire whose only wish is
to forsake all vampires.

26:59.710 --> 27:00.916
(Scoffing)

27:02.620 --> 27:05.920
How did the Aidan I knew
80 years ago become that...

27:07.250 --> 27:09.560
a heretic?

27:15.600 --> 27:16.897
He cannot fail.

27:18.170 --> 27:21.060
My daughter cannot fail.

27:21.100 --> 27:22.829
Not again.

27:31.950 --> 27:33.839
We must help
him, Hegeman,

27:33.880 --> 27:36.144
you and I.

27:43.090 --> 27:46.788
No folly,
no distractions,

27:46.830 --> 27:48.889
no wolf.

27:55.070 --> 27:56.993
(Siren in distance)

27:58.310 --> 27:59.835
- So it's true.

28:00.840 --> 28:02.569
We're dead.

28:02.610 --> 28:05.170
- I told you I am going to
do everything possible

28:05.210 --> 28:06.974
to keep that
from happening.

28:07.010 --> 28:09.047
- But you're not
the leader, right?

28:11.020 --> 28:12.090
- No.

28:12.120 --> 28:15.090
- So it's not your decision
who dies and who lives.

28:15.120 --> 28:19.660
- Tommy, I think that the
best thing that you could do,

28:19.690 --> 28:21.419
that any of
you could do...

28:22.930 --> 28:24.227
Leave.

28:24.270 --> 28:25.669
(Scoffing)

28:25.700 --> 28:27.020
Protect yourselves.

28:27.070 --> 28:28.959
(Scoffing)

28:32.140 --> 28:35.735
- He loved you,
you know that?

28:35.780 --> 28:37.009
Bishop.

28:37.040 --> 28:38.303
More than anything.

28:38.350 --> 28:39.704
He said when push
came to shove,

28:39.750 --> 28:42.071
that you would
be there for him,

28:42.120 --> 28:43.315
for all of us.

28:44.320 --> 28:46.687
I guess not.

29:05.840 --> 29:07.069
(Clearing throat)

29:07.110 --> 29:09.238
- You've been a little
bit hard on me.

29:09.280 --> 29:10.509
- Really?

29:10.540 --> 29:13.248
- Yeah, a little bit.
Well...

29:13.280 --> 29:14.679
OK, not a ton.

29:14.720 --> 29:17.178
Just a pinch.

29:20.690 --> 29:22.317
- We made a deal.

29:22.360 --> 29:26.422
- I know, and it is the most
important thing in my life.

29:26.460 --> 29:27.791
(Scoffing)

29:30.830 --> 29:33.128
She's asked me to
help lead Boston.

29:34.140 --> 29:35.790
- Mother?

29:37.400 --> 29:43.100
Am I supposed to be clutching
my pearls in shock?

29:43.140 --> 29:45.450
"Cause I'm not shocked.

29:45.480 --> 29:48.973
- I know. I'm just
telling you, because...

29:49.020 --> 29:51.284
In order to be free,

29:51.320 --> 29:53.687
really and truly free,

29:55.960 --> 29:59.021
I'm gonna have
to do this.

29:59.060 --> 30:04.066
There's a good chance
that I will become...

30:04.100 --> 30:06.569
something...

30:07.370 --> 30:09.793
that you would
not recognize.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.801
And when--

30:15.940 --> 30:18.705
And if that happens...

30:19.980 --> 30:24.781
Josh, I'm gonna need you
to somehow remind me...

30:27.050 --> 30:28.814
what we started here.

30:32.960 --> 30:34.997
- And I always
wanted to tell you

30:35.030 --> 30:37.556
when we were both
back in high school

30:37.600 --> 30:41.935
and I--I guess it just never
really slipped out, you know.

30:41.970 --> 30:45.634
And now you're here
and I do wanna tell you,

30:45.670 --> 30:50.801
and as I said, you know,
we're here and...

30:56.350 --> 30:58.114
- Hey!

30:58.150 --> 31:00.847
- Oh! Hi!

31:00.890 --> 31:04.087
- Hi! I have news for you.
We're dead.

31:04.130 --> 31:06.986
You're dead, and that pretty
much levels the playing field.

31:07.030 --> 31:08.429
So don't write off
a guy like Stevie

31:08.460 --> 31:10.394
just because he's not
cool enough.

31:10.430 --> 31:13.297
Nobody's watching. You can
do whatever you want!

31:13.330 --> 31:15.037
- If I can do
whatever I want,

31:15.070 --> 31:17.232
then why are you forcing me
on Suicide Stevie?

31:17.270 --> 31:19.466
- I'm standing right here,
hearing everything.

31:19.510 --> 31:21.137
- You haven't been
dead that long,

31:21.180 --> 31:23.899
so maybe you haven't gotten to
that soul-searching part yet,

31:23.950 --> 31:25.509
so why don't
I save you some time?

31:25.550 --> 31:27.405
You were shallow.
You were conceited.

31:27.450 --> 31:30.420
You made the entire
cafeteria a killing field.

31:30.450 --> 31:33.954
God, Stevie killed himself and
you don't even remember him?

31:33.990 --> 31:37.119
Really, Diane? 'Cause I
remember you planning a memorial

31:37.160 --> 31:39.879
just to get
votes for prom queen.

31:39.930 --> 31:41.352
- Seriously?

31:42.860 --> 31:45.261
- Life is easy
for people like you.

31:45.300 --> 31:47.064
Death shouldn't be.

31:50.170 --> 31:51.865
- Wow!

31:51.910 --> 31:53.264
- Yeah.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.503
- You're right.

31:58.550 --> 32:01.372
I was a terrible person.

32:02.980 --> 32:04.482
- OK...

32:04.520 --> 32:08.150
- I'm sorry I didn't
remember you.

32:08.190 --> 32:12.821
The truth is, I was always
jealous of girls like you.

32:12.860 --> 32:16.251
When I died, for my
last split-second.

32:16.300 --> 32:19.895
I was thinking:
"Thank God!"

32:19.930 --> 32:22.570
I can finally
just relax!

32:22.600 --> 32:27.333
I've been sucking
my stomach in for 15 years.

32:27.370 --> 32:29.429
(Laughing)

32:29.480 --> 32:32.370
Oh! Thank you!

32:35.920 --> 32:37.672
Was that
there before?

32:40.020 --> 32:43.251
- And there's your door.

32:43.290 --> 32:45.019
- My what?

32:45.060 --> 32:47.028
- She doesn't even
know what it is!

32:49.000 --> 32:50.798
- Come on.

33:24.600 --> 33:26.967
(Car honking)

33:30.500 --> 33:32.434
- The car's up front.

33:37.640 --> 33:39.347
- Show yourselves.

33:46.520 --> 33:48.386
- What the hell
are you doing, Tommy?

33:48.420 --> 33:51.060
- We just need
to talk to her.

33:51.090 --> 33:53.081
A few seconds, Mother.

33:53.130 --> 33:56.452
Please, that's all we need.
- Not like this. Not here.

33:56.500 --> 33:57.626
- We didn't do anything, Aidan.

33:57.660 --> 33:59.526
She can't just
slaughter us like cattle.

33:59.570 --> 34:01.231
- I told you
I'd deal with it.

34:01.270 --> 34:03.090
- Then deal with it!

34:04.040 --> 34:05.508
Join us...

34:07.010 --> 34:08.330
and we'll all be free.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.371
- Don't do this.

34:10.409 --> 34:13.380
(Hissing)

34:13.409 --> 34:15.219
(Growling)

34:26.429 --> 34:27.386
- Aaah!

34:27.429 --> 34:28.693
(Grunts)

34:30.730 --> 34:32.061
(Panting)

34:32.100 --> 34:33.170
Aidan...

34:36.400 --> 34:38.107
(Grunting)

34:38.139 --> 34:39.938
- Go!

34:41.580 --> 34:43.070
Come on.

34:43.110 --> 34:44.748
- Aaah!

34:44.780 --> 34:45.975
- Aaah!

34:48.650 --> 34:50.139
(Groaning)

34:52.590 --> 34:54.614
(Hissing)

35:00.290 --> 35:02.258
(Gasps)

35:07.430 --> 35:10.297
(Hissing)

35:24.650 --> 35:27.312
- Thanks for letting
me do this.

35:27.350 --> 35:29.284
- Sure.

35:30.820 --> 35:33.187
- When I was a
freshman in college,

35:33.230 --> 35:36.427
I woke up in some theatre
major's apartment

35:36.460 --> 35:38.622
with my clothes
across the room,

35:38.670 --> 35:42.595
my hair still
smelling like vomit.

35:42.640 --> 35:46.702
I'd puked in front of
the entire party, repeatedly,

35:46.740 --> 35:50.631
while reciting "Stopping By
the Woods on a Snowy Evening”

35:50.680 --> 35:53.069
just to prove
that I wasn't drunk.

35:53.110 --> 35:54.180
(Chuckling)

35:55.620 --> 35:58.646
The point is once you've
picked your naked way

35:58.690 --> 36:03.082
across the theatre geek's living
room in the cold light of day,

36:03.120 --> 36:04.383
after a vodka binge--

36:04.430 --> 36:06.751
- It's not
the same, Nora.

36:06.790 --> 36:10.420
- No, it's not
the same thing.

36:13.330 --> 36:17.096
But the reason that
I want to be here for you,

36:17.140 --> 36:19.336
is that I don't want you
to feel alone in this.

36:23.880 --> 36:26.474
- You want to hold
my hair back while I vomit.

36:26.510 --> 36:28.103
(Chuckling)

36:28.150 --> 36:29.117
- Yes.

36:29.150 --> 36:30.447
- Yeah, essentially.

36:31.450 --> 36:33.214
(Chuckling)

36:39.260 --> 36:41.297
I love you.

36:44.730 --> 36:49.998
Now, seriously, please get as
far away from me as possible.

37:16.860 --> 37:18.362
(Sighing)

37:21.770 --> 37:23.864
(Owl hooting)

37:27.940 --> 37:30.238
(* Man vocalizing )

37:48.230 --> 37:50.324
** Hold me

37:51.500 --> 37:53.798
* Memory

37:53.830 --> 37:55.559
* You see

37:55.600 --> 37:57.034
- Guys?

37:57.070 --> 37:59.801
* Where I'm going

37:59.840 --> 38:01.501
Capital.

38:01.540 --> 38:06.444
* Give back
all I had before

38:10.720 --> 38:12.745
* Moving

38:13.790 --> 38:16.487

38:16.520 --> 38:19.455

38:30.940 --> 38:34.399
* Oh

38:36.440 --> 38:40.809
* Eclipsing into

38:42.250 --> 38:44.981
* All that I can't ignore *

38:45.020 --> 38:47.216
(Breathing unevenly)

39:14.310 --> 39:16.540
Whoa.

39:20.090 --> 39:22.912
Guys, get your friggin'
asses down here!

39:22.960 --> 39:25.520
This is incredible!

39:33.330 --> 39:34.866
Hello?

39:34.900 --> 39:37.597
(Wind blowing)

39:38.640 --> 39:42.634
Aidan! Josh!
Family meeting!

39:42.680 --> 39:44.603
Now, please!

39:46.880 --> 39:49.042
Hello!

39:49.080 --> 39:50.411
(Rumbling)

39:50.450 --> 39:52.282
Who are you?

39:58.560 --> 40:00.255
What do you want?

40:01.530 --> 40:04.591
(Screaming)

40:06.070 --> 40:08.266
Oh! Oh!

40:26.250 --> 40:28.753
(Groaning)

40:33.390 --> 40:35.552
(Screaming)

40:42.070 --> 40:44.630
- My little girl.

40:51.680 --> 40:54.399
(Josh screaming in distance)

40:57.680 --> 41:00.718
(Panting)

41:00.750 --> 41:03.458
- (Whispering):
Oh, thank you, thank you.

41:03.490 --> 41:05.379
Thank you.

41:05.430 --> 41:06.852
Oh!

41:06.890 --> 41:08.756
(Engine starting)

41:10.760 --> 41:13.366
(Sighing)

41:13.400 --> 41:16.131
(Groaning)

41:16.170 --> 41:20.732
No! No, Josh!
Josh! Josh!

41:21.910 --> 41:23.503
(Creaking)

41:23.540 --> 41:26.271
(Screaming)

41:35.490 --> 41:37.083
(Screaming)

41:42.460 --> 41:45.066
(Grunting)
