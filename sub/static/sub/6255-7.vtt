00:47.937 --> 00:49.771
I'm trying to understand
how you can get

00:49.805 --> 00:52.307
such enjoyment
from doing nothing.

00:52.341 --> 00:54.075
Come on, it's a beautiful day,
I'm on my honeymoon.

00:54.110 --> 00:55.510
I'm with the woman
that I love.

00:55.544 --> 00:56.711
I've got a cold
beer in my hand.

00:56.746 --> 00:57.712
I mean, you tell me.

00:57.747 --> 00:59.948
What could be more perfect?

01:07.957 --> 01:10.458
You get bit
by something?

01:10.493 --> 01:15.363
I'm just trying to achieve the
same state of enjoyment you are.

01:15.397 --> 01:16.698
Here, let me help you out
with that, okay?

01:16.732 --> 01:17.766
Just take the brim of your hat,

01:17.800 --> 01:19.000
just pull it down over your eyes

01:19.034 --> 01:21.136
like that,
get the beer,

01:21.170 --> 01:22.637
take a sip.

01:22.671 --> 01:24.773
Mmm, and go...

01:24.807 --> 01:26.040
Ah!

01:26.075 --> 01:27.108
Ah!

01:27.143 --> 01:29.010
Relaxation.

01:29.044 --> 01:31.146
Relaxing makes me tense.

01:31.180 --> 01:34.215
The last time
I was in Buenos Aires,

01:34.250 --> 01:36.484
I was always doing something.

01:36.519 --> 01:38.052
Okay, I'll tell you what, um...

01:38.087 --> 01:39.587
why don't we go
to those, um,

01:39.622 --> 01:41.055
waterfall pools, huh?

01:41.090 --> 01:42.357
That the hotel guy
was recommending.

01:42.391 --> 01:44.392
Those pools are contaminated

01:44.426 --> 01:46.694
with fecal matter
from wild boar.

01:46.729 --> 01:48.897
I did see
something amazing

01:48.931 --> 01:52.200
the last time I was here
that I would love to show you.

01:52.234 --> 01:53.234
All right.

01:53.269 --> 01:55.103
Anything for my bride.

01:57.540 --> 01:58.973
You got to be
kidding me, Bones.

01:59.008 --> 02:00.642
This is your idea
of a honeymoon outing?

02:00.676 --> 02:02.177
Don't you find
this fascinating?

02:02.211 --> 02:04.012
These remains are
the Desaparecidos--

02:04.046 --> 02:05.580
"the Disappeared."

02:05.614 --> 02:09.083
They were political dissidents
that were tortured

02:09.118 --> 02:10.651
and then executed by
their own government

02:10.686 --> 02:12.654
during Argentina's
Dirty War.

02:12.688 --> 02:13.721
Dr. Brennan?

02:13.756 --> 02:15.056
I'm Letitia Perez.

02:15.090 --> 02:16.591
I run
the Buenos Aires Morgue.

02:16.625 --> 02:18.893
It's an honor to have you visit.

02:18.928 --> 02:20.562
Yes, I imagine it is.

02:20.596 --> 02:22.397
Dr. Perez, I would
like you to meet

02:22.431 --> 02:24.132
my husband, Seeley Booth.

02:24.166 --> 02:25.767
- We're on our honeymoon.
- Yeah.

02:25.801 --> 02:28.169
Oh. And you came here?

02:28.204 --> 02:30.772
See? I wanted to go
to the waterfall pools.

02:30.806 --> 02:32.040
Oh, I wouldn't.

02:32.074 --> 02:33.942
There's fecal matter
from the boars.

02:33.976 --> 02:36.845
I was here ten years ago
assisting Dr. Herrera.

02:36.879 --> 02:38.513
Oh, he passed away last year.

02:38.547 --> 02:40.715
I hope to live up
to his memory.

02:40.749 --> 02:43.751
This is where
the remains are from.

02:43.786 --> 02:45.253
The victims were shot,

02:45.287 --> 02:46.254
then burned.

02:46.288 --> 02:47.622
It is a part of our past

02:47.656 --> 02:49.724
we are not proud of.

02:49.758 --> 02:51.893
My work is for the victims.

02:51.927 --> 02:53.161
I understand.

02:53.195 --> 02:55.029
I only wish
you had the technology

02:55.064 --> 02:58.499
we enjoy at the Jeffersonian
instead of this.

02:58.534 --> 03:01.369
We might not have machines
to do our work for us, like you,

03:01.403 --> 03:04.706
but we are proud of
what we can accomplish here.

03:04.740 --> 03:06.875
I assure you,
I have done extraordinary work

03:06.909 --> 03:09.444
without the benefit
of technology.

03:09.478 --> 03:10.378
Hmm.

03:10.412 --> 03:11.813
Okay, great.

03:11.847 --> 03:13.014
Thank you so much for showing us

03:13.048 --> 03:14.716
your lovely place here, Doc.

03:14.750 --> 03:16.384
See, we have a windsurfing
appointment we have to get to.

03:16.418 --> 03:18.586
No, we don't.
We do now.

03:19.889 --> 03:21.389
Enjoy your honeymoon,
Dr. Brennan.

03:21.423 --> 03:23.725
I must get back to work.

03:26.829 --> 03:29.030
Wait.

03:29.064 --> 03:30.565
ans)

03:30.599 --> 03:32.033
These bones couldn't
have been found

03:32.067 --> 03:33.601
in the same pit
as the others.

03:33.636 --> 03:35.069
They were.

03:35.104 --> 03:37.272
I supervised
the excavation myself.

03:37.306 --> 03:38.840
Come on, Bones,
let's go. Come on.

03:38.874 --> 03:40.408
This victim was killed
recently, Booth.

03:40.442 --> 03:42.610
We have a responsibility.

03:42.645 --> 03:44.479
She never would've seen this.
Well, I'm sorry,

03:44.513 --> 03:45.480
but you are wrong.

03:45.514 --> 03:47.115
These bones were discovered

03:47.149 --> 03:49.984
under several layers of remains
that are 30 years old.

03:50.019 --> 03:51.619
They have black char
on the underside.

03:51.654 --> 03:52.754
All of the others

03:52.788 --> 03:55.790
are uniformly gray and white.

03:55.824 --> 03:57.825
This body was burned recently.

04:02.498 --> 04:04.999
Oh, my God.

04:05.034 --> 04:07.302
You're right.

04:07.336 --> 04:10.638
No better place to hide a body
than a mass grave.

04:12.741 --> 04:14.742
Okay, Bones,
this is what we're gonna do.

04:14.777 --> 04:16.344
We just tell
the cop what we discovered.

04:16.378 --> 04:19.047
We go back to the pool,
we relax, okay?

04:19.081 --> 04:20.982
There's a beer
with your name on it.

04:21.016 --> 04:23.584
That's an excellent idea.
This is my jurisdiction.

04:23.619 --> 04:26.487
I have a standing offer
from your government to act

04:26.522 --> 04:29.157
as a forensic anthropologist
whenever my services are needed.

04:29.191 --> 04:31.893
Just ask Deputy
Minister Ortiz.

04:31.927 --> 04:34.462
But Dr. Perez--
she can handle this.

04:34.496 --> 04:37.098
I've seen no evidence
of that so far.

04:37.132 --> 04:38.499
This is his office?

04:38.534 --> 04:40.969
The inspector likes
his espresso.

04:41.003 --> 04:43.204
Dr. Brennan, this is an honor.

04:43.238 --> 04:44.973
I am Inspector Raphael Valenza.

04:45.007 --> 04:48.343
This is my new husband,
Seeley Booth.

04:48.377 --> 04:51.412
Agent Andy, I can't
believe I'm meeting you.

04:51.447 --> 04:53.181
You've read my books?
Every one.

04:53.215 --> 04:55.583
Agent Andy is one of the best
characters in literature.

04:55.617 --> 04:58.886
Well, he merely supports
Dr. Reichs.

04:58.921 --> 05:02.090
That's what he wants her to
think, because he's a real man.

05:02.124 --> 05:03.858
Got a good point there, Bones.

05:05.027 --> 05:06.094
My car.

05:06.128 --> 05:08.396
The same one
Agent Andy drives.

05:25.914 --> 05:27.915
Hey! <i>Hola,</i> time-out, okay?

05:27.950 --> 05:31.352
Can someone please tell me
what's going on here?

05:31.387 --> 05:33.021
Someone was murdered,
and Dr. Brennan has

05:33.055 --> 05:34.489
graciously offered to assist

05:34.523 --> 05:36.424
in the investigation.
Right, of course she did.

05:36.458 --> 05:37.759
Bones, it's our honeymoon!

05:39.628 --> 05:41.262
I can't believe the real Agent
Andy will be assisting me.

05:41.296 --> 05:42.730
What? Wait, wait, wait, wait.

05:42.765 --> 05:43.765
Well, then it's settled.

05:43.799 --> 05:45.033
Let me give you a ride back.

05:45.067 --> 05:46.834
Oh, okay.

05:46.869 --> 05:48.503
Dr. Perez will
welcome you into her morgue

05:48.537 --> 05:50.705
with an open heart
and open mind.

05:50.739 --> 05:51.973
Oh-ho, wait a second there.

05:52.007 --> 05:53.708
Okay, everybody just...

05:53.742 --> 05:57.178
Slow down there, Inspector,
because this is our honeymoon.

05:57.212 --> 05:58.813
Well, what better way
to honeymoon

05:58.847 --> 06:00.348
than with intrigue
and adventure?

06:00.382 --> 06:02.250
He has a point, Booth.

Very well, thank you.

06:42.088 --> 06:43.956
We've been enjoying sex
very much.

06:43.990 --> 06:46.992
Good, good, I'm glad
you're taking some time off.

06:47.026 --> 06:49.494
Don't worry about Christine,
either, by the way.

06:49.529 --> 06:51.496
Her and Michael Vincent
are getting along great.

06:51.531 --> 06:53.432
Thank you for taking care
of her, Angela.

06:53.466 --> 06:56.702
Yeah, anything to help
you... take a vacation

06:56.736 --> 06:57.936
in what looks like

06:57.971 --> 06:59.705
a morgue?

06:59.739 --> 07:01.640
This is Dr. Letitia Perez,

07:01.674 --> 07:03.542
the coroner here
at the Buenos Aires Morgue.

07:03.576 --> 07:05.744
She will be assisting me
in this investigation.

07:05.778 --> 07:07.746
Hi, hi, it's nice to meet you.

07:07.780 --> 07:09.414
Help!

07:09.449 --> 07:11.650
I am not assisting
Dr. Brennan.

07:11.684 --> 07:13.619
She is consulting for me.

07:13.653 --> 07:15.754
Mm, good luck with that.

07:15.788 --> 07:16.888
Wha... what is wrong?

07:16.923 --> 07:18.790
Look at this.

07:18.825 --> 07:19.891
Dr. Brennan.

07:19.926 --> 07:21.760
You're on your honeymoon.

07:21.794 --> 07:22.995
Why are you in a morgue?

07:23.029 --> 07:25.030
Morgues are not romantic.

07:25.064 --> 07:27.165
Booth and I got tired of lying
in the sun, drinking beer.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.635
Well, you know what? We're gonna
get back to the fun in the sun

07:29.669 --> 07:31.536
and drinking, but, you know
what, to be honest, Bones and I,

07:31.571 --> 07:32.771
we just... we love
working together.

07:32.805 --> 07:34.539
It's what we do best.

07:34.574 --> 07:36.875
I've tried to explain
that I'm fine on my own.

07:36.909 --> 07:40.345
Well, how did they wind up
asking you guys for help?

07:40.380 --> 07:42.180
Look, I don't want to
brag, but I'm kind of

07:42.215 --> 07:43.915
a national hero here.
Ah, yes.

07:43.950 --> 07:46.151
Agent Andy Lister is
the epitome

07:46.185 --> 07:48.086
of the ideal police officer.

07:48.121 --> 07:50.055
Based on me, you know--
I mean, whatever,

07:50.089 --> 07:52.157
you know,
makes Bones happy.

07:52.191 --> 07:53.992
So, you guys go on a honeymoon

07:54.027 --> 07:55.961
and we wind up
solving an Argentinean murder?

07:55.995 --> 07:57.596
Hopefully.

07:57.630 --> 07:59.031
Awesome.

07:59.065 --> 08:00.065
I have
the missing person files.

08:00.099 --> 08:01.133
Good.

08:01.167 --> 08:02.768
The victim is elderly...

08:02.802 --> 08:04.102
The notably textured
sternal rib ends

08:04.137 --> 08:07.072
indicate that
the victim was

08:07.106 --> 08:08.573
approximately 90 years old.

08:08.608 --> 08:10.728
And the long narrow nasal
aperture suggests Caucasian.

08:10.743 --> 08:13.412
You are the worst
vacation taker in the world.

08:13.446 --> 08:14.946
I concur.

08:14.981 --> 08:17.616
You should be receiving evidence
in the next few hours.

08:17.650 --> 08:20.452
I'm sure you will impress
Dr. Perez.

08:20.486 --> 08:22.621
I'm a national hero.

08:30.229 --> 08:32.364
The Argentine murder victim's
X-rays are being sent now.

08:32.398 --> 08:33.832
Angela is working

08:33.866 --> 08:36.301
on a facial reconstruction
based on photos

08:36.335 --> 08:38.437
and detailed measurements.

08:38.471 --> 08:40.605
They did a good job
of packing this clothing.

08:40.640 --> 08:42.474
No contamination.
Oh.

08:42.508 --> 08:46.211
Dr. Brennan sent bone samples
for a histological profile.

08:46.245 --> 08:48.714
They aren't completely clean.

08:48.748 --> 08:50.015
That's right.

08:50.049 --> 08:51.283
So I'm to clean these bones?

08:51.317 --> 08:52.984
And give me
the leftovers.

08:54.754 --> 08:57.689
<i>I retrieved these insects</i>
<i>from the remains.</i>

08:57.724 --> 09:01.626
The mass grave is 30 years old,
but these insects suggest

09:01.661 --> 09:04.029
the time of death is
within one month.

09:04.063 --> 09:06.498
We'll see
if our entomologist concurs.

09:06.532 --> 09:08.567
I send my most difficult
samples to the university,

09:08.601 --> 09:10.569
but I am confident
I am correct.

09:10.603 --> 09:12.904
I find it's best
not to be overly confident.

09:12.939 --> 09:15.841
I was not aware you knew
any other way to be.

09:24.183 --> 09:25.751
Oh! Wow, good.

09:25.785 --> 09:27.085
It's got bite.
What is this?

09:27.120 --> 09:28.487
It's local.

09:28.521 --> 09:30.288
<i>La cola del Diablo--</i>
"the devil's tail."

09:30.323 --> 09:31.790
That is some tail, huh?

09:35.027 --> 09:36.661
Excuse me. Oh.

09:36.696 --> 09:38.263
Honeymoon stuff.

09:38.297 --> 09:39.598
Booth.

09:39.632 --> 09:41.600
Why are you working
on your honeymoon?

09:41.634 --> 09:43.034
It's not healthy.

09:43.069 --> 09:45.937
Look, I have been deputized,
okay, Sweets?

09:45.972 --> 09:46.938
I'm a national hero.

09:46.973 --> 09:48.206
I don't really believe that.

09:48.241 --> 09:49.908
Come on, be happy for me,
all right?

09:49.942 --> 09:52.778
Bones and me-- we're having
a great honeymoon, okay?

09:52.812 --> 09:54.112
Okay, I'm happy.

09:54.147 --> 09:55.514
Okay, that's better now,
so listen to me.

09:55.548 --> 09:56.848
I need you to run a check

09:56.883 --> 09:59.751
on an Inspector Comissario
Raphael Valenza.

09:59.786 --> 10:01.787
Go to my computer.

10:01.821 --> 10:03.755
Use it access the OAI

10:03.790 --> 10:04.890
records in Argentina.

10:04.924 --> 10:06.358
Okay. Why?

10:06.392 --> 10:07.425
I don't want to end up
helping someone

10:07.460 --> 10:08.527
who ends up being corrupt.

10:08.561 --> 10:09.528
That's why.

10:09.562 --> 10:11.129
Guy dresses really well,

10:11.164 --> 10:12.931
he sips coffee at a café,
he's got a pocket watch,

10:12.965 --> 10:14.332
and he drives a fancy car.

10:14.367 --> 10:15.967
Oh, well,
if that's the case, then...

10:16.002 --> 10:17.235
It is.

10:17.270 --> 10:19.504
All right.

10:19.539 --> 10:20.839
To the, uh...
Hey.

10:20.873 --> 10:23.008
snake tail or whatever
that is, huh?

10:23.042 --> 10:24.534
Mm-hmm.

10:24.569 --> 10:26.912
Security video from
the mass grave site

10:26.946 --> 10:28.313
shows only government cars

10:28.347 --> 10:30.015
entering and exiting.

10:30.049 --> 10:31.850
Well, time of death
was a month ago,

10:31.876 --> 10:33.618
so we should concentrate
around that area.

10:33.653 --> 10:35.178
As you say,
definitely.

10:35.213 --> 10:37.547
I'm telling you, there is
a lot of missing people.

10:37.582 --> 10:40.016
Well, I expect Agent Andy's
famous instincts

10:40.051 --> 10:41.885
will narrow the search.

10:41.919 --> 10:45.055
Right, right, so let's, uh,
look for 90-year-olds, right?

10:45.089 --> 10:48.124
There are none, but why would
anyone murder a 90-year-old man?

10:48.159 --> 10:50.827
Why not just wait for nature
to take its course?

10:50.862 --> 10:52.596
Well, once Bones finds
out the cause of death,

10:52.630 --> 10:53.551
we'll have that answer.

10:53.564 --> 10:55.565
"Bones"?
Yeah.

10:55.600 --> 10:58.735
That's what Agent Andy calls
Dr. Kathy Reichs...

10:58.769 --> 11:00.203
to make her uncomfortable.

11:00.238 --> 11:02.072
Well, you know, in real life,
she likes it.

11:02.106 --> 11:03.607
Oh, really?
Yeah.

11:03.641 --> 11:06.309
Wait, this Mercedes is not
a government vehicle.

11:06.344 --> 11:07.777
How far back is this?

11:07.812 --> 11:09.379
Three weeks, four days,
and 11 hours.

11:09.413 --> 11:12.616
How long between when
it went in and came out?

11:14.719 --> 11:16.052
Almost two hours.

11:16.087 --> 11:17.821
That's enough time
to bury a body.

11:17.855 --> 11:20.824
Yeah, too bad we can't
see the plates.

11:20.858 --> 11:23.960
♪ The wheels on
the bus go round and round... ♪

11:23.995 --> 11:25.595
It still feels weird being in

11:25.630 --> 11:27.631
Booth and Brennan's house
without them.

11:27.665 --> 11:31.468
Yeah. Well, be even weirder
to be living here with them.

11:31.502 --> 11:33.870
The kids play
really well together.

11:33.905 --> 11:36.139
I know, right? Man, two kids.

11:36.173 --> 11:37.540
They entertain each other,

11:37.575 --> 11:38.742
you know?

11:38.776 --> 11:40.644
Cuts the parenting time
in half.

11:42.380 --> 11:43.914
I'm making an observation.

11:43.948 --> 11:46.349
You are making a sale, mister.

11:46.384 --> 11:47.450
Oh, am I?

11:47.485 --> 11:48.785
Yeah, you think you are.

11:52.189 --> 11:53.323
It's kind of quiet.

11:53.357 --> 11:55.325
Yeah, it's
a little too quiet.

11:57.862 --> 11:59.095
Hey, Michael?

11:59.130 --> 12:00.897
Kiddos?

12:05.436 --> 12:07.737
Hey. Over here.

12:15.046 --> 12:16.479
For a second there,

12:16.514 --> 12:18.848
I thought they'd made
a break for it.

12:27.291 --> 12:30.193
You start every
workday like this? Wow.

12:30.227 --> 12:32.429
Yes. It clears my mind
and puts life into...

12:32.463 --> 12:33.797
Perspective.

12:33.831 --> 12:34.864
Perspective.
Mm-hmm.

12:34.899 --> 12:36.066
What, you don't approve?

12:36.100 --> 12:37.901
Oh, hey,
I approve big-time.

12:37.935 --> 12:39.469
Look at this spread
you got.

12:39.503 --> 12:41.538
Oh. Look at this.

12:41.572 --> 12:43.974
It's a facial reconstruction
of our victim.

12:44.008 --> 12:45.175
Amazing.

12:45.209 --> 12:46.910
You send it to me,
I can run it through

12:46.944 --> 12:49.312
our SIBIOS System
for a match.

12:49.347 --> 12:50.714
You know, I'm curious.

12:50.748 --> 12:53.016
Who's your favorite
fictional policeman?

12:53.050 --> 12:54.551
From who do you
draw inspiration?

12:54.585 --> 12:55.819
Superman.

12:55.853 --> 12:57.887
With respect,
Superman is not police.

12:57.922 --> 12:59.656
Ah, he still catches
the bad guys. That's right.

13:00.925 --> 13:02.058
Hey, got it.

13:02.093 --> 13:03.593
Miguel Eduardo Silva.

13:03.627 --> 13:05.628
He looks scary, don't you agree?

13:05.663 --> 13:08.264
It's scary that he's driving
at 90. That's what's scary.

13:08.299 --> 13:10.000
So, what's next?

13:10.034 --> 13:12.702
What's next is we go talk
to Miguel's family, right?

13:12.737 --> 13:15.105
Immediately after
our breakfast, yes?

13:15.139 --> 13:17.107
Okay, let's do it
the American way--

13:17.141 --> 13:19.809
immediately and with
a great deal of noise.

13:27.485 --> 13:28.818
Door is open.

13:28.853 --> 13:30.453
Yeah.

13:30.488 --> 13:31.454
Right.

13:33.624 --> 13:35.191
The wife--
look at her.

13:35.226 --> 13:37.994
They were probably together
their whole lives.

13:39.463 --> 13:41.297
<i>Buenos dias, señora.</i>
<i>Buenos dias.</i>

13:41.332 --> 13:42.732
<i>Buenos dias.</i>

13:48.139 --> 13:51.841
<i>Señora Silva!</i>
<i>La buscan!</i>

13:55.479 --> 13:57.981
Ah. No wife.

13:59.050 --> 14:00.950
Ah, yeah.
That's the wife?

14:00.985 --> 14:02.952
I have a pretty good idea
how he died, huh?

14:02.987 --> 14:04.687
Please, do not
make me laugh

14:04.722 --> 14:06.389
at such a serious moment.

14:06.424 --> 14:08.091
<i>¿Si?</i>

14:10.402 --> 14:13.037
<i>Gracias.</i>

14:13.071 --> 14:15.472
I can't believe
Miguel is gone.

14:15.507 --> 14:17.241
I'm very sorry
for your loss.

14:17.275 --> 14:19.009
That's very sweet
of you.

14:19.044 --> 14:20.978
So is it true?

14:21.012 --> 14:22.746
Are you the real Agent Andy?

14:22.781 --> 14:24.982
Yes, he is, señora.

14:25.016 --> 14:26.884
I would choose my words
very carefully.

14:26.918 --> 14:28.319
Everyone reads
those books?

14:28.353 --> 14:29.720
Of course.

14:29.754 --> 14:31.922
We are a nation of readers,
Agent Booth.

14:31.957 --> 14:33.757
Right. So why is it that

14:33.792 --> 14:35.426
you didn't report
your husband missing?

14:35.460 --> 14:38.429
It wasn't unusual
for Miguel to be away.

14:38.463 --> 14:40.631
Sometimes he was gone for weeks.

14:40.665 --> 14:41.765
Doing what?

14:41.800 --> 14:43.934
I have no idea.
He never told me.

14:43.969 --> 14:45.102
And you didn't care?

14:45.136 --> 14:46.837
A woman with
so much free time,

14:46.871 --> 14:48.772
waiting around for
a 90-year-old man?

14:48.807 --> 14:50.708
What are you
accusing me of here?

14:50.742 --> 14:51.942
I don't understand.

14:51.977 --> 14:54.511
What, being married
to an older man?

14:54.546 --> 14:55.879
Being beautiful?

14:55.914 --> 14:57.281
These are not crimes.

14:57.315 --> 15:00.184
No, the crime that we're
investigating is murder.

15:00.218 --> 15:02.453
Did your husband
have any enemies?

15:02.487 --> 15:03.654
I don't know.

15:03.688 --> 15:05.956
Miguel was a very
private man.

15:05.991 --> 15:07.691
Oh, and a volatile one.

15:07.726 --> 15:09.293
So why'd you
stay with him?

15:10.996 --> 15:13.063
You obviously don't
understand Buenos Aires,

15:13.098 --> 15:14.565
Agent Booth.

15:14.599 --> 15:16.467
I was born in Ciudad Evita.

15:16.501 --> 15:17.968
It's, uh...

15:18.003 --> 15:19.269
it's bad.

15:19.304 --> 15:21.138
It's... very bad.

15:21.172 --> 15:22.706
Miguel took me
off the streets.

15:22.741 --> 15:24.375
He gave me a new life.

15:24.409 --> 15:27.444
A strange life, but a better
life than the one I had.

15:27.479 --> 15:30.180
So why would I kill
the man who gave me that?

15:30.215 --> 15:33.183
Well, you have a lot to
gain from-from his death.

15:33.218 --> 15:35.252
You know, a beautiful home,
bank accounts...

15:35.286 --> 15:36.987
There was no bank account.

15:37.022 --> 15:38.722
Everything was cash with Miguel.

15:38.757 --> 15:41.358
I receive an allowance
every month in cash.

15:41.393 --> 15:44.428
With him gone, I don't have
the money to keep the house.

15:44.462 --> 15:45.896
I don't even have a car.

15:45.930 --> 15:47.164
The Mercedes was his,

15:47.198 --> 15:48.799
and it disappeared
with Miguel.

15:49.934 --> 15:51.201
An s550?

15:51.236 --> 15:52.670
Yes.

15:52.704 --> 15:55.806
I'm starting
all over again now.

15:55.840 --> 15:58.642
As poor as I was
when Miguel found me.

16:00.378 --> 16:04.081
I thought Agent Andy
would understand.

16:05.250 --> 16:07.117
<i>So you think the killer</i>

16:07.152 --> 16:08.419
ed the victim's car
to dump the body?

16:08.453 --> 16:09.687
Well, it makes
sense, right?

16:09.721 --> 16:10.988
We have to
find the car.

16:11.022 --> 16:12.723
After three
and a half weeks?

16:12.757 --> 16:15.038
Come on, you must know people
who have spare parts, right?

16:15.060 --> 16:17.261
Isn't that what you used
to restore your old car?

16:17.295 --> 16:18.929
This is why you are an icon.

16:18.963 --> 16:20.431
I'll call
a friend I know

16:20.465 --> 16:21.699
who trades in spare parts.

16:21.733 --> 16:23.200
Okay, h-hold on.

16:23.234 --> 16:26.403
I'll catch up with you;
I gotta take this call.

16:27.739 --> 16:30.107
Will you get your feet
off my desk?

16:31.676 --> 16:33.043
How did you know that?

16:33.078 --> 16:34.378
You had the
forward-facing camera on.

16:34.412 --> 16:35.779
I saw your feet.

16:37.148 --> 16:38.949
Oh.

16:38.983 --> 16:40.884
All right.

16:40.919 --> 16:43.387
Well, I looked into, uh,
your friend Valenza.

16:43.421 --> 16:45.289
He worked with our guys
on a Joint Task Force

16:45.323 --> 16:47.858
against the cartels
in the late '90s,

16:47.892 --> 16:50.160
and busted some corrupt
local judges in 2006.

16:50.195 --> 16:52.529
Since then, he's gone
head-to-head against corruption

16:52.564 --> 16:54.331
in Buenos Aires.
He's squeaky clean.

16:54.365 --> 16:56.266
All right, so he's
one of the good guys.

16:56.301 --> 16:57.701
On paper.

16:57.736 --> 16:59.236
But police corruption

16:59.270 --> 17:01.138
has been a problem
in Buenos Aires.

17:01.172 --> 17:03.907
The cops either need
the support of the community

17:03.942 --> 17:06.577
or their fellow officers,
which this guy has neither.

17:06.611 --> 17:07.845
So I wouldn't be surprised

17:07.878 --> 17:09.579
if his sense of
loyalty is colored...

17:09.614 --> 17:11.115
Look, look, unless you have
something solid

17:11.148 --> 17:12.516
on this guy, all right,
I'm gonna give him

17:12.550 --> 17:13.851
the benefit of the doubt,
you know?

17:13.885 --> 17:15.219
And don't touch my bobblehead.

17:15.252 --> 17:17.253
I didn't.

17:17.288 --> 17:18.821
Well, it was bouncing.

17:21.259 --> 17:22.925
I have the fracture map

17:22.961 --> 17:25.295
you constructed from
the X-rays, Dr. Edison.

17:25.329 --> 17:27.064
Unfortunately, Dr. Perez

17:27.098 --> 17:29.032
doesn't have the capability
to do that here.

17:29.067 --> 17:30.434
Well, I couldn't
determine which ones

17:30.468 --> 17:32.002
were caused by
the heat of the fire

17:32.036 --> 17:33.837
and which, if any,
are perimortem or antemortem.

17:33.872 --> 17:36.740
Even with all that equipment?

17:36.775 --> 17:39.877
We can make
those determinations here,

17:39.911 --> 17:41.345
now that we know
where to look.

17:41.379 --> 17:42.613
Can't we, Dr. Perez?

17:42.647 --> 17:43.981
With ease.

17:44.015 --> 17:45.115
Well, good luck.

17:45.150 --> 17:47.017
There are a lot of them.

17:47.051 --> 17:48.452
We've determined
that some of the bones

17:48.486 --> 17:50.287
were calcined
by the fire,

17:50.321 --> 17:52.289
but most of them
remain intact.

17:52.323 --> 17:53.557
That means
the fire burned

17:53.591 --> 17:54.925
somewhere between
300 and 700 degrees.

17:54.959 --> 17:56.927
Very impressive.

17:56.961 --> 17:59.129
Yeah, a wood fire.

17:59.164 --> 18:00.731
Macrobotanical charcoal
found on the bones

18:00.765 --> 18:03.534
and clothing samples confirm
that gasoline was used

18:03.568 --> 18:05.636
as an accelerant
to ignite the wood

18:05.670 --> 18:06.837
and thus burn the body.

18:06.871 --> 18:08.005
Burning a body is not easy.

18:08.039 --> 18:09.273
Right.

18:09.307 --> 18:10.307
I'm still working on

18:10.341 --> 18:11.642
the type of wood
that was used,

18:11.676 --> 18:13.644
so I'll get back
to you on that.

18:37.535 --> 18:40.470
My friend said the Mercedes
was abandoned near here.

18:40.505 --> 18:42.840
Someone tried
to sell him the parts.

18:42.874 --> 18:44.508
Well, if somebody's
gonna strip and dump a car,

18:44.542 --> 18:46.176
this definitely looks like
the place to do it.

18:46.211 --> 18:48.512
Ciudad Evita is a <i>zona liberada.</i>

18:48.546 --> 18:51.014
The cops won't come here.

18:51.049 --> 18:52.482
It's run by the bad guys.

18:52.517 --> 18:53.984
Well, we're in here.

18:54.018 --> 18:56.920
Which is why
you'd better take this.

18:56.955 --> 18:58.989
Right.

18:59.023 --> 19:01.592
Isn't this where Silva's wife
said she was from?

19:01.626 --> 19:02.993
It is.

19:03.027 --> 19:04.194
I know many like her

19:04.229 --> 19:06.196
who would do anything
to get out.

19:06.231 --> 19:09.099
And anything
not to go back.

19:10.468 --> 19:13.003
All right.

19:14.405 --> 19:15.606
Ready?

19:15.640 --> 19:16.940
Oh, there it is.

19:16.975 --> 19:18.442
What's left of it, huh?

19:18.476 --> 19:19.843
When the thieves
strip a car here,

19:19.878 --> 19:21.078
they take everything.

19:21.112 --> 19:22.412
Well, I'm gonna
take a look anyway.

19:22.447 --> 19:23.380
Maybe we can get

19:23.414 --> 19:25.749
some fabric off the seats.

19:25.783 --> 19:28.585
Maybe pull some, uh,
particulates...

19:28.620 --> 19:31.255
Take an evidence bag.
Mm-hmm.

19:58.216 --> 20:00.584
Well, they didn't
take everything.

20:00.618 --> 20:02.753
Look at this.

20:04.088 --> 20:07.090
That's not a car key.

20:10.061 --> 20:11.828
Hey.

20:11.863 --> 20:14.464
I finally got
Christine to sleep.

20:14.499 --> 20:16.833
Oh, this is just...
this is unbelievable.

20:16.868 --> 20:19.169
I mean...
put one kid down,

20:19.203 --> 20:20.304
the other one
starts crying.

20:20.338 --> 20:22.673
This-this isn't
babysitting,

20:22.707 --> 20:24.441
it's a sleep
deprivation study.

20:24.475 --> 20:26.710
Maybe it was
something they ate.

20:26.744 --> 20:28.312
Well, we had the same
SpaghettiOs.

20:28.346 --> 20:29.780
We're not crying.

20:32.383 --> 20:33.784
Okay, it's your turn.

20:43.494 --> 20:46.730
Oh, no, that did not count
as your turn.

20:46.764 --> 20:48.131
Yes, it did.

20:48.166 --> 20:49.566
I got up.
No, no.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.034
It only counts
if you go in

20:51.069 --> 20:52.836
and you pick them up
and you rock them.

20:52.870 --> 20:54.037
No. Wait, no.

20:54.072 --> 20:55.272
We go on crying.

20:55.306 --> 20:56.506
Christine cried,
you went.

20:56.541 --> 20:57.841
Michael Vincent cried,
I went.

20:57.875 --> 20:59.810
So next time,
it's your turn.

20:59.844 --> 21:01.511
No way.
That's not fair.

21:01.546 --> 21:03.146
That doesn't even...
That's the way it goes, babe.

21:05.149 --> 21:07.317
It's your turn.

21:08.553 --> 21:10.020
Dr. Brennan should be back soon.

21:10.054 --> 21:11.321
I can have her contact you...

21:11.356 --> 21:12.689
No. I can tell you.

21:12.724 --> 21:15.025
Your work has been
very impressive so far.

21:15.059 --> 21:17.561
I thought you would credit
Dr. Brennan for the work here.

21:17.595 --> 21:19.930
No, Dr. Brennan does that
on her own.

21:19.964 --> 21:21.765
Take it from one
who's been there.

21:21.799 --> 21:24.901
The tougher she is, the more
respect she has for you.

21:24.936 --> 21:27.571
I appreciate that, Dr. Edison.

21:27.605 --> 21:28.839
No problem.

21:28.873 --> 21:30.340
Now, when you do see her,

21:30.375 --> 21:31.975
let her know that the plane
grating spectrograph

21:32.010 --> 21:33.477
of the bone sample

21:33.511 --> 21:37.714
turned up some interesting
histological results.

21:37.749 --> 21:40.484
It seems that the victim
had prolonged exposure

21:40.518 --> 21:43.220
to hydrogen cyanide
ethyl bromoacetate.

21:44.355 --> 21:46.390
That's Zyklon-B.

21:46.424 --> 21:48.759
Yeah.

21:53.064 --> 21:55.165
Bianca said that
no one comes down here.

21:55.199 --> 21:56.333
Well, you know what?

21:56.367 --> 21:57.667
Someone needed this key,
all right?

21:57.702 --> 21:59.069
It was made
by the same locksmith

21:59.103 --> 22:01.772
that made the others
for the house.

22:04.275 --> 22:06.009
Hey, what's up, Bones?

22:06.044 --> 22:08.578
Where are you? I went to
the cafe, but you weren't there.

22:08.613 --> 22:09.813
Well, you know the key

22:09.847 --> 22:11.581
that we found in,
uh, Silva's car?

22:11.616 --> 22:14.251
We think it might fit...

22:14.285 --> 22:15.752
in his basement.

22:15.787 --> 22:18.889
I saw Dr. Edison's
histological analysis.

22:18.923 --> 22:21.858
The victim showed evidence
of prolonged exposure

22:21.893 --> 22:23.560
to a gas called Zyklon-B.

22:23.594 --> 22:24.861
Nazi gas?

22:24.896 --> 22:26.063
Yes.

22:26.097 --> 22:28.298
I think Silva might have
been a prisoner

22:28.332 --> 22:29.966
in a concentration camp.

22:31.736 --> 22:34.704
Oh, I don't think
he was a prisoner.

22:38.009 --> 22:39.910
Looks like
he was a Nazi.

22:49.115 --> 22:50.448
Whoa, look at that, huh?

22:50.483 --> 22:51.816
It's a Van Gogh.

22:51.851 --> 22:53.218
Oh, you know
about art, too?

22:53.252 --> 22:54.386
He signed it.

22:54.420 --> 22:56.588
Blood on the wall.

22:56.622 --> 22:58.056
And on the floor.

22:58.090 --> 23:00.592
Blood spattered
all over the place.

23:00.626 --> 23:01.893
Okay, someone dragged something

23:01.928 --> 23:03.795
right through
the bloodstains there.

23:07.800 --> 23:09.434
Wood.

23:09.468 --> 23:10.669
The scoring marks

23:10.703 --> 23:12.270
suggest that it was heavy,

23:12.305 --> 23:14.172
but the blood was dry
when it was dragged

23:14.206 --> 23:15.740
because there
are no streak marks.

23:15.775 --> 23:17.776
As a coroner,
my area of expertise

23:17.810 --> 23:19.611
must include much more
than bones.

23:19.645 --> 23:21.413
So the bad man
killed Silva,

23:21.447 --> 23:25.050
dumps the body, returns
and drags something out.

23:25.084 --> 23:27.519
I'll send these photos to Cam
for confirmation,

23:27.553 --> 23:31.990
but I'd say this happened

23:32.024 --> 23:34.192
So, the killer returns
to the scene the next day?

23:34.226 --> 23:35.260
That's pretty risky.

23:35.294 --> 23:37.028
Whoa, wait a second.

23:38.331 --> 23:39.698
Look over here.

23:39.732 --> 23:41.266
Meter by half meter.

23:41.300 --> 23:44.369
What do you think,
it was a trunk? A desk?

23:46.272 --> 23:49.074
What's that?

23:49.108 --> 23:50.342
Let me see.

23:50.376 --> 23:52.777
"Melmer"?

23:52.812 --> 23:55.246
You find out what Melmer is,
and I'll get blood samples

23:55.281 --> 23:57.415
and particulates back to the morgue.
Okay.

23:57.450 --> 24:00.619
Listen, Bones, you sure you
want to continue doing this?

24:00.653 --> 24:02.621
I mean, look, we can
just call it quits

24:02.655 --> 24:04.155
and go back to the pool.

24:04.190 --> 24:06.791
We're doing what we love
with the person we love.

24:06.826 --> 24:08.693
I actually find it
highly romantic.

24:08.728 --> 24:11.896
A feeling we can explore further
when we're alone.

24:11.931 --> 24:13.398
Mmm... all right.

24:13.432 --> 24:15.133
<i>I ran these photos</i>

24:15.167 --> 24:17.002
from the cellar through
the Israeli government

24:17.036 --> 24:18.503
and the Simon Wiesenthal Center.

24:18.537 --> 24:19.971
Guess what.

24:20.006 --> 24:22.007
They discovered Silva was not
who he said he was.

24:22.041 --> 24:23.074
Correct.

24:23.109 --> 24:26.578
Are you guys in a cafe?

24:26.612 --> 24:29.214
Yeah. It's a very
civilized way to work.

24:29.248 --> 24:30.482
Right?

24:30.516 --> 24:32.717
But your new wife
is in the morgue?

24:32.752 --> 24:33.952
Okay, really?

24:33.986 --> 24:35.620
You know her;
she loves it, okay?

24:35.655 --> 24:37.155
So just tell me
about the old guy.

24:37.189 --> 24:38.990
Miguel Silva was actually

24:39.025 --> 24:41.292
Sturmbannfuhrer Herman Haupt.

24:41.327 --> 24:44.295
Haupt was known as
the Monster of Majdanek,

24:44.330 --> 24:46.998
a concentration camp
near Lublin, Poland.

24:47.033 --> 24:48.800
He personally sent thousands

24:48.834 --> 24:51.069
of Poles and Jews
to the gas chambers.

24:51.103 --> 24:52.570
So a war criminal.

24:52.605 --> 24:55.040
Good luck.

24:56.709 --> 24:58.943
So we're looking for a killer
of a Nazi war criminal.

24:58.978 --> 25:01.413
That just opens up
a whole world of suspects.

25:01.447 --> 25:03.481
In 1945, President Peron sent

25:03.516 --> 25:08.319
10,000 blank passports to
the Nazis offering citizenship.

25:08.354 --> 25:10.055
It's our shame.

25:10.089 --> 25:14.859
So, Haupt got one of those
Argentine passports?

25:14.894 --> 25:16.594
Yes.
I got to say,

25:16.629 --> 25:19.164
if somebody tracked down
this old Nazi and killed him...

25:19.198 --> 25:21.166
It's our job
to catch murderers, correct?

25:21.200 --> 25:23.268
I must do my job
no matter who the victim is.

25:23.302 --> 25:24.869
Well, that's right,

25:24.904 --> 25:27.472
but what if the killer
just wanted to rob Silva?

25:27.506 --> 25:30.942
There's a man,
an expert in Nazi war criminals.

25:30.976 --> 25:32.477
We should talk to him.

25:32.511 --> 25:34.079
After our cafe.

25:34.113 --> 25:37.148
Yeah, immediately after.

25:39.018 --> 25:42.954
I found fractures
on the ulna and the radius

25:42.988 --> 25:45.356
that are perimortem.
Where?

25:45.391 --> 25:47.492
Here where the burn line
crosses the fracture margin,

25:47.526 --> 25:50.328
indicating that the fire had
access to the part of the bone

25:50.362 --> 25:51.763
that was broken.

25:51.797 --> 25:54.165
Similar fractures here
on the metacarpal

25:54.200 --> 25:56.134
and here on the phalanges.

25:56.168 --> 25:57.736
Excellent finding.

25:57.770 --> 26:00.705
These are defensive wounds,
indicating a struggle.

26:00.740 --> 26:02.640
Yes, buthese injuries
wouldn't kill him.

26:02.675 --> 26:04.909
So we still don't have
the cause of death.

26:04.944 --> 26:08.446
Correct. Let's take
a closer look at the skull.

26:12.451 --> 26:13.218
Oh, God.

26:13.252 --> 26:14.753
Wow.

26:14.787 --> 26:16.821
I'll put it back together.
No, I'll do it.

26:16.856 --> 26:18.423
I apologize.

26:18.457 --> 26:20.792
Of course, I was in the wrong.

26:22.027 --> 26:25.463
You know, perhaps
it would go quicker

26:25.498 --> 26:27.665
if we worked on it
together.

26:29.335 --> 26:32.303
We've all dropped
human remains before.

26:38.677 --> 26:40.478
Of course we knew
about Haupt.

26:40.513 --> 26:42.447
We were trying
to extradite him.

26:42.481 --> 26:44.382
And who are you, Mossad?

26:44.416 --> 26:46.751
No, I'm a retired man.

26:46.786 --> 26:48.853
I try to help out
where I can.

26:48.888 --> 26:50.655
Forgive me,

26:50.689 --> 26:54.926
but if you were unable to
extradite Haupt, perhaps you...

26:54.960 --> 26:57.228
We were trying to bring Nazis
to justice,

26:57.263 --> 26:59.230
not become murderers ourselves.

26:59.265 --> 27:00.698
Why couldn't he be extradited?

27:00.733 --> 27:05.036
Haupt was rich and he had
friends in high places.

27:06.172 --> 27:07.739
I was thinking
Haupt was

27:07.773 --> 27:11.276
an old man with every hope
of escaping justice.

27:11.310 --> 27:14.012
I just don't like the idea
of him dying in his own bed.

27:14.046 --> 27:16.614
In the arms
of a beautiful young wife.

27:16.649 --> 27:21.953
Agent Booth, we do not expect
justice in the world,

27:21.987 --> 27:27.225
but we take great pride
in seeking it out.

27:28.394 --> 27:31.496
Is it true that
this is the man

27:31.530 --> 27:35.667
upon whom Agent Andy Lister
is based in the novels?

27:35.701 --> 27:37.168
It's true.
In the flesh.

27:37.203 --> 27:38.736
Yeah.
Ah.

27:38.771 --> 27:42.707
You will sign my book?

27:42.741 --> 27:44.576
Oh.

27:44.610 --> 27:46.811
Right. Yeah. Sure.

27:46.846 --> 27:48.546
David.
Ah.

27:48.581 --> 27:50.415
Like David who slew Goliath.

27:50.449 --> 27:52.483
The very same.

27:52.518 --> 27:55.253
Right.

27:55.287 --> 27:57.288
<i>So, the wood sample</i>
<i>that you sent</i>

27:57.323 --> 28:00.158
to me from the scrapings
from the wine cellar floor

28:00.192 --> 28:02.152
came from a deciduous conifer

28:02.161 --> 28:04.095
called the larch tree.

28:06.332 --> 28:07.899
Hey.

28:07.933 --> 28:09.467
Why is Christine in
the lab, Dr. Hodgins?

28:09.501 --> 28:11.202
Yeah.

28:11.237 --> 28:12.971
Day care called because
Christine and Michael Vincent

28:13.005 --> 28:15.473
wanted to see us, and-and since
you're away, we thought...

28:15.507 --> 28:17.475
Yes! No, it's great, right?

28:17.509 --> 28:18.977
How cute.

28:19.011 --> 28:21.145
Whoa. Okay, wait a second.
Is Cam okay with that?

28:21.180 --> 28:23.815
Cam? Oh, yeah, yeah.

28:23.849 --> 28:26.251
Okay, okay.
That's it.

28:26.285 --> 28:28.686
I am taking them
back to day care.

28:28.721 --> 28:30.755
You know what I said about
the children being in the lab.

28:30.789 --> 28:32.357
Yes, we do, yes.

28:32.391 --> 28:33.892
Why don't you say hello
to Booth and Brennan,

28:33.926 --> 28:37.528
who are on their honeymoon
and are so happy that

28:37.563 --> 28:38.863
we're taking such good care
of Christine.

28:38.898 --> 28:40.498
Hey there, newlyweds.

28:42.134 --> 28:44.836
I was just saying that
we are so delighted

28:44.870 --> 28:47.438
to have the kids with us
here at the lab.

28:47.473 --> 28:51.175
So sad that they have
to go back to day care now.

28:51.210 --> 28:52.677
Okay, see you later.

28:52.711 --> 28:55.113
It's great that you all
are having so much fun.

28:55.147 --> 28:56.381
Tons.

28:56.415 --> 28:58.650
Yes, it's a
piece of cake.

28:58.684 --> 29:00.952
You know, two is easier
than one, actually.

29:00.986 --> 29:02.186
Much.

29:02.221 --> 29:04.022
Where's my...?

29:04.056 --> 29:06.357
Oh, my...
Okay, we're gonna go.

29:06.392 --> 29:07.926
We're gonna go.

29:07.960 --> 29:10.395
Can we just get on with
what we were talking about here?

29:10.429 --> 29:12.697
Yes. Good.
Murder. Right.

29:12.731 --> 29:17.869
So, the wood sample that you
sent me-- it predates 1945

29:17.903 --> 29:22.006
because it lacks the isotopes
cesium-134 and strontium-90.

29:22.041 --> 29:23.975
Those were in everything
after the first

29:24.009 --> 29:25.677
nuclear bomb explosions
in the mid-1940's.

29:25.711 --> 29:29.480
Everything in the wine cellar
was Nazi stuff predating 1945.

29:29.515 --> 29:32.216
Well, according to documents
from World War Two,

29:32.251 --> 29:35.753
Haupt was assigned to the
Merkers Keiselbach Salt Mine--

29:35.788 --> 29:39.357
the infamous storehouse
of the stolen Nazi treasure.

29:39.391 --> 29:42.026
Now, when the U.S.
found the mine,

29:42.061 --> 29:45.163
there were hundreds
of paintings, uh, bags of cash,

29:45.197 --> 29:48.132
and wooden crates
filled with bars of gold.

29:48.167 --> 29:49.434
Let me guess.

29:49.468 --> 29:51.269
The crates were made
out of larch trees.

29:51.303 --> 29:54.272
Amazing.
What deductive instincts.

29:54.306 --> 29:55.640
And the, uh...

29:55.674 --> 29:58.910
the Melmer packing slip,
according to records,

29:58.944 --> 30:01.512
each of the crates filled
with gold in the Merkers mine

30:01.547 --> 30:03.881
bore a packing slip
marked "Melmer,"

30:03.916 --> 30:06.250
named after the original courier
who delivered

30:06.285 --> 30:07.719
the crates of gold bars.

30:07.753 --> 30:10.188
So what was dragged
across the cellar...

30:10.222 --> 30:12.223
Was a crate of Nazi gold.

30:18.464 --> 30:20.165
While we were
reconstructing the skull,

30:20.199 --> 30:24.102
I discovered
subtle discoloration on

30:24.136 --> 30:26.337
the coronal suture
interdigitations.

30:26.372 --> 30:30.742
This indicates a subdural
hematoma caused by a direct blow

30:30.776 --> 30:32.544
to the coronal suture
was cause of death.

30:32.578 --> 30:33.878
So, dropping the skull

30:33.913 --> 30:35.647
turned out to be a good thing.

30:35.681 --> 30:37.248
Everything has
a silver lining.

30:37.283 --> 30:38.516
True.

30:38.551 --> 30:41.319
In this case,
there is no silver lining.

30:41.353 --> 30:43.555
Sweetie, try to be nice;
you're a guest.

30:43.589 --> 30:47.358
I know. I only meant that here
the lining is gold, not silver.

30:47.393 --> 30:51.196
You see the gold flakes
in the fracture?

30:51.230 --> 30:53.898
So Haupt was beaten to death
with a bar of gold?

30:53.933 --> 30:55.200
That's my conclusion.

30:55.234 --> 30:56.968
We finally found
our cause of death.

30:57.002 --> 30:57.969
Oh, great.

30:58.003 --> 30:59.838
By the way, uh,

30:59.872 --> 31:01.806
you don't have to worry
about Christine.

31:01.841 --> 31:05.243
Hodgins and I have
everything under control.

31:05.277 --> 31:07.045
I wasn't worried.

31:07.079 --> 31:10.048
Okay. All right, well, um,
I'm gonna go talk to Hodgins,

31:10.082 --> 31:11.583
and tell him about the gold,

31:11.617 --> 31:13.818
and he can search for
any matching particulates.

31:13.853 --> 31:16.221
So, I'll talk to you later.

31:19.058 --> 31:22.327
Forgive me, but I
find it difficult

31:22.361 --> 31:24.362
to imagine you
as a mother.

31:24.396 --> 31:30.201
It's been the most wonderful
experience I've ever had.

31:30.236 --> 31:32.403
Don't you want children,
Dr. Perez?

31:32.438 --> 31:34.939
I thought so,
at one point.

31:34.974 --> 31:38.343
But I've seen so much cruelty
and evil in this world

31:38.377 --> 31:41.112
that I couldn't bring
a child into that.

31:41.147 --> 31:44.616
It's our job to make the world
a better place for our children.

31:44.650 --> 31:46.885
Don't you believe
that's possible?

31:46.919 --> 31:50.522
I envy you your
optimism, Dr. Brennan.

31:52.791 --> 31:54.225
<i>¿Un cafécito?</i>

31:54.260 --> 31:55.426
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Cup of coffee's great.

31:55.461 --> 31:57.162
Booth!
Yeah?

31:57.196 --> 31:58.329
The killer didn't bring

31:58.364 --> 32:00.465
the weapon to the scene
of the crime.

32:00.499 --> 32:02.834
He used one of the gold bars
in the room.

32:02.868 --> 32:05.270
So it wasn't premeditated; it
was probably a crime of passion.

32:05.304 --> 32:08.540
You know, to see the two of you
work together, it's magical.

32:08.574 --> 32:10.475
Dr. Reichs should be
highly respected.

32:10.509 --> 32:13.211
She is. She's the focus
of the books.

32:13.245 --> 32:14.879
Aw, come on, Bones,
just admit it, okay?

32:14.914 --> 32:16.314
Argentina's my domain.

32:18.584 --> 32:20.285
I should get back to Dr. Perez.

32:20.319 --> 32:22.420
It feels like there's something
we're still missing.

32:22.454 --> 32:24.722
Dr. Brennan, are you enjoying
your honeymoon?

32:24.757 --> 32:27.959
As a matter of fact, I am.

32:27.993 --> 32:29.260
Aren't we, Booth?

32:29.295 --> 32:31.696
Yeah, we-we are.
I mean, I know it's hard

32:31.730 --> 32:34.299
for people to understand,
but we are.

32:34.333 --> 32:36.693
Although I am starting
to miss our hotel room.

32:36.718 --> 32:38.003
Wow.

32:39.071 --> 32:41.239
She's more wonderful
than Dr. Reichs.

32:41.273 --> 32:43.474
Yeah, tell me about it, huh?

32:43.509 --> 32:45.510
Okay, Dr. Reichs
doesn't have

32:45.544 --> 32:47.111
the same sensual
quality that...

32:47.146 --> 32:48.913
"Tell me about it"
is just a phrase.

32:48.948 --> 32:50.848
Oh.
Yeah.

32:50.883 --> 32:54.519
Uh, there's something about
this case that makes no sense.

32:54.553 --> 32:56.154
What's that?

32:56.188 --> 32:57.689
This isn't something
that you can take

32:57.723 --> 32:59.490
into a bank
and trade for cash.

32:59.525 --> 33:02.427
Right.

33:02.461 --> 33:05.930
Well, do you know anybody
who would buy Nazi gold?

33:08.934 --> 33:11.936
What's all this about,
Inspector?

33:11.971 --> 33:13.638
I run an honest business.

33:13.672 --> 33:15.840
We both know that's
not true, Ramon.

33:15.874 --> 33:17.242
Allow me to introduce you

33:17.276 --> 33:19.644
to Agent Booth from
Washington, D.C.

33:19.678 --> 33:21.512
Agent Andy? The guy...?

33:24.016 --> 33:26.117
I swear,
I have done nothing wrong.

33:26.151 --> 33:27.852
You're awfully defensive
for an innocent man.

33:27.886 --> 33:29.654
I will answer anything.
Anything I ask you?

33:29.688 --> 33:30.788
Okay, where do I start?

33:30.823 --> 33:32.557
Um, oh, I got it.

33:32.591 --> 33:34.659
What about the bars of Nazi gold
that you've been fencing?

33:34.693 --> 33:37.996
I don't know
what you're talking about.

33:38.030 --> 33:40.398
Do you know the book where
Agent Andy dangles the man

33:40.432 --> 33:42.367
from the top
of the tall building?

33:48.240 --> 33:50.408
But that's not true.

33:50.442 --> 33:52.644
It's a book, right?

33:56.715 --> 33:59.050
Oh, look at this,
Agent Booth.

33:59.084 --> 34:01.552
The federales have been
searching your office,

34:01.587 --> 34:02.887
and they found the gold.

34:06.358 --> 34:07.425
Where'd you buy the gold from?

34:07.459 --> 34:08.893
I tell my customers

34:08.927 --> 34:11.829
that our business will remain...
confidential.

34:11.864 --> 34:13.431
Right, okay.
Let me just hit him once.

34:13.465 --> 34:15.300
There's no need.

34:15.333 --> 34:17.969
My men told me that they found
blood on one of the bars.

34:18.003 --> 34:19.304
Probably the victim's.

34:19.338 --> 34:21.139
How would you say
"accessory to murder" again?

34:21.172 --> 34:23.074
<i>Cómplice de asesinato.</i>

34:24.043 --> 34:26.476
Murder?

34:26.512 --> 34:28.913
Okay, I get it.

34:28.947 --> 34:31.349
You don't have to play
the hard balls with me.

34:31.382 --> 34:32.483
I make a deal.

34:32.518 --> 34:34.085
Two gold bars for Agent Andy

34:34.119 --> 34:37.088
and two gold bars for my
good friend, Inspector Valenza.

34:38.623 --> 34:40.558
He does.
He reads the book, right?

34:40.592 --> 34:42.293
I mean, you do read the books.

34:42.328 --> 34:46.797
I mean, do you really think that
Agent Andy would accept a bribe?

34:48.600 --> 34:50.534
Maybe I'll let Agent Andy
spend a little time with you.

34:50.569 --> 34:52.136
That's a good idea.

34:52.170 --> 34:54.105
I... bought the gold
from a woman.

34:54.139 --> 34:54.972
What woman?

34:55.007 --> 34:56.274
Very beautiful.

34:56.308 --> 34:58.609
Too beautiful to kill,
I'm convinced.

34:58.644 --> 34:59.811
Is this her?

34:59.845 --> 35:02.647
Yes.

35:02.681 --> 35:04.849
She's much prettier in person.

35:10.356 --> 35:11.923
Oh-ho, Bianca,

35:11.957 --> 35:13.725
we going on a little trip?

35:13.759 --> 35:14.792
I'm sorry.

35:14.827 --> 35:16.461
I'm in a rush. I'm late.

35:16.495 --> 35:17.695
I will call you as soon...
No, no! Look at that!

35:17.730 --> 35:19.497
She's getting away, huh?!

35:19.531 --> 35:20.832
...I promise,
but I'm so very late.

35:20.866 --> 35:21.866
Whoa! What, are you kidding me?

35:21.900 --> 35:23.267
<i> No disparen!</i>

35:23.302 --> 35:24.702
Slow down!
I was just kidding, okay?

35:24.737 --> 35:26.304
Wow!

35:26.338 --> 35:29.273
What do we got here, huh?

35:29.308 --> 35:32.477
Look at this, huh?
Look at all that cash.

35:32.511 --> 35:34.579
Wow, looks like someone got
a good price for the Nazi gold.

35:34.613 --> 35:36.614
Bianca Silva,
you are under arrest

35:36.648 --> 35:39.083
for the murder
of your husband.

35:42.146 --> 35:44.380
Why could we not do this
at the cafe?

35:44.457 --> 35:46.992
Because we think
you are a murderer, señora.

35:47.027 --> 35:48.994
And murderers do not get
fine espresso.

35:49.029 --> 35:51.363
I have killed no one!
Alvarez told us

35:51.398 --> 35:53.932
he bought the gold from you,
he paid cash.

35:53.967 --> 35:56.068
The same cash
we found in your bag.

35:56.102 --> 35:57.469
<i>Maldito mentiroso!</i>

35:57.504 --> 35:59.638
It's my gold, found in

35:59.672 --> 36:00.773
my wine cellar.

36:00.807 --> 36:02.307
I mean, where is the crime?

36:02.342 --> 36:04.043
Well, the gold was yours
because he died.

36:04.077 --> 36:05.377
Maybe you just got tired
of waiting

36:05.412 --> 36:06.712
for that to happen naturally.

36:06.746 --> 36:08.447
You know what?
I did not kill Miguel.

36:08.481 --> 36:10.849
And yet you were in the wine
cellar where your husband was

36:10.884 --> 36:12.317
beaten to death with a gold bar.

36:12.352 --> 36:13.786
Yeah, my wine cellar, my gold!

36:13.820 --> 36:16.622
You know what? I find
this conversation tedious!

36:16.656 --> 36:18.257
How'd you get the gold
out of the cellar?

36:18.258 --> 36:20.526
My maid-- she's very old
but very strong.

36:20.560 --> 36:22.227
We find any of your fingerprints

36:22.262 --> 36:24.630
on any of the gold covered
in your husband's blood...

36:24.664 --> 36:26.799
We will bounce.
"Pounce."

36:26.833 --> 36:28.767
What's the word? Pounce.
Pounce, pounce.

36:28.802 --> 36:30.169
The door to the wine cellar
was open.

36:30.203 --> 36:31.603
That's the end of the story.

36:31.638 --> 36:33.972
Pounce on that.

37:15.615 --> 37:18.417
Dr. Brennan, they have
arrested Bianca Silva.

37:18.451 --> 37:19.751
Say again, please.

37:19.786 --> 37:21.887
I said they have
arrested Bianca Silva.

37:21.921 --> 37:23.889
Really?

37:23.923 --> 37:25.724
So you can stop now.

37:25.758 --> 37:28.794
Go back to your...
honeymoon holiday.

37:28.828 --> 37:32.064
There's still a lot of
work to do for the trial.

37:32.098 --> 37:33.432
Yes, Dr. Brennan.

37:33.466 --> 37:35.434
My work.

37:38.671 --> 37:42.040
It's... it's been my pleasure
working with you.

37:42.075 --> 37:44.476
Really?
Yes.

37:44.511 --> 37:46.145
You reminded me
how important it is

37:46.179 --> 37:48.647
not to rely on technology.

37:48.681 --> 37:51.383
The Jeffersonian
makes that difficult.

37:51.417 --> 37:53.752
Thank you for saying that.

37:54.687 --> 37:56.788
Oh.

37:56.823 --> 37:58.357
What?

37:58.391 --> 38:00.492
Nothing.

38:08.468 --> 38:10.836
I think you've arrested
the wrong person.

38:10.870 --> 38:12.771
But how can that be?

38:12.805 --> 38:15.240
Do either of you have an
alternate theory of this murder?

38:15.275 --> 38:18.143
I believe Letitia Perez
is related to the victim.

38:18.178 --> 38:19.278
And your reasoning is?

38:19.312 --> 38:20.946
When we shook hands
to say good-bye,

38:20.980 --> 38:24.149
I felt a small avulsion
on the metacarpal of her thumb.

38:24.184 --> 38:26.818
You could tell that
from shaking her hand?

38:26.853 --> 38:27.986
What can I say, huh?

38:28.021 --> 38:30.022
She's amazing.

38:42.502 --> 38:45.170
What's this?
I have nothing new to tell you.

38:45.205 --> 38:47.085
Well, we know you're a pterodactyl.
Polydactyly.

38:47.106 --> 38:47.639
Right.

38:47.640 --> 38:49.785
Is it true that you were
born with an extra thumb?

38:51.444 --> 38:53.212
You had it
surgically removed as a child.

38:53.246 --> 38:55.214
So what?

38:55.248 --> 38:57.649
Haupt had the same
genetic abnormality.

38:57.684 --> 38:59.651
Are you related
to Herman Haupt?

38:59.686 --> 39:01.587
She's his granddaughter.

39:01.621 --> 39:03.822
So what? It's meaningless.

39:03.856 --> 39:05.457
It's suspicious.

39:05.491 --> 39:07.392
A man gets murdered,
and you don't tell anyone

39:07.427 --> 39:08.594
he's your grandfather?

39:08.628 --> 39:09.995
Letitia, as a friend,

39:10.029 --> 39:11.630
I suggest you call a lawyer.

39:11.664 --> 39:14.132
And tell a story which explains
why you killed

39:14.167 --> 39:17.135
a Nazi war criminal
who was your grandfather.

39:25.245 --> 39:27.412
I devoted my life
to identifying

39:27.447 --> 39:31.383
the 10,000 victims
of the Dirty War.

39:31.417 --> 39:34.686
It was my way
of fighting back.

39:34.721 --> 39:37.155
You understand.

39:39.025 --> 39:42.928
Then to find out
that my own grandfather killed

39:42.962 --> 39:46.865
many more times that number
of innocent people.

39:46.899 --> 39:49.201
And he thought I was like him.

39:49.235 --> 39:51.069
You didn't know
he was a Nazi?

39:51.104 --> 39:54.206
Not until he took me down to
his wine cellar and showed me.

39:54.240 --> 39:55.941
He told to me,

39:55.975 --> 39:58.577
"This will all be yours
when I die."

39:58.611 --> 40:00.479
That I will be wealthy.

40:00.513 --> 40:02.080
And you killed him?

40:02.115 --> 40:04.383
You didn't want
the blood money, did you?

40:04.417 --> 40:07.286
He laughed at me.

40:07.320 --> 40:09.454
He said I was weak.

40:09.489 --> 40:11.623
He called me <i>mestiza.</i>

40:11.658 --> 40:13.225
"Mixed-breed."

40:13.259 --> 40:15.027
"A mongrel."

40:15.061 --> 40:16.895
So I grabbed the closest thing
and I hit him.

40:16.929 --> 40:20.766
And I hit him
until he stopped laughing.

40:22.168 --> 40:25.070
I'm sorry.

40:27.674 --> 40:31.243
You know I have
to arrest you, right?

40:33.513 --> 40:35.947
I know.

40:37.850 --> 40:40.285
I have no regrets.

40:53.800 --> 40:56.868
I'm kind of glad this
babysitting thing happened.

40:56.903 --> 40:59.071
Yeah, one kid, right?

40:59.105 --> 41:00.405
Whoa, I mean, listen.

41:00.440 --> 41:02.274
Other people can have
four or five kids,

41:02.308 --> 41:04.343
but that-that
is just not us.

41:04.377 --> 41:05.644
It's not our style.

41:05.678 --> 41:07.879
No, no, we like our sleep.

41:07.914 --> 41:09.181
We like fine dining.

41:09.215 --> 41:10.415
Alone time.

41:10.450 --> 41:11.616
Like now.

41:11.651 --> 41:12.951
Yeah, this.

41:12.985 --> 41:14.319
This is nice.

41:14.354 --> 41:15.921
Yeah.

41:17.657 --> 41:19.124
Where are the kids?

41:19.158 --> 41:22.361
Oh, no.

41:22.395 --> 41:24.196
Kiddos?

41:24.230 --> 41:26.365
Okay, here we go again.

41:26.399 --> 41:28.233
Michael?

41:28.267 --> 41:31.136
Okay.

41:32.372 --> 41:34.373
Hey, hey.

41:35.174 --> 41:36.608
Found them.

41:44.417 --> 41:45.584
I want another one.

41:45.618 --> 41:49.421
Yeah, me too.

41:58.998 --> 42:00.499
What you reading there, Bones?

42:00.533 --> 42:02.167
Oh, the identification
of human remains

42:02.201 --> 42:04.236
that have been scavenged
by sharks.

42:04.270 --> 42:05.470
I borrowed it
from the mortuary library.

42:05.505 --> 42:07.005
Ooh, it's a page turner.

42:07.039 --> 42:09.107
It's actually quite fascinating.
Mm-hmm.

42:09.142 --> 42:10.998
What do you have
hidden behind your back?

42:11.023 --> 42:11.610
These?

42:11.611 --> 42:13.812
These here? Oh, I'm just
trying to come up with a way

42:13.846 --> 42:15.847
to, uh, keep
the honeymoon afloat.

42:15.882 --> 42:17.282
By getting me drunk?

42:17.316 --> 42:19.651
No. It's so hot out
here, know what?

42:19.685 --> 42:21.153
We have to
hydrate, hydrate.

42:21.187 --> 42:22.354
Cheers.
Cheers.

42:22.388 --> 42:23.355
Hydration.

42:23.389 --> 42:25.657
Mmm. Ah!
Mmm.

42:25.691 --> 42:26.740
Ah!

42:26.765 --> 42:27.692
There it is!
You know what?

42:27.693 --> 42:29.133
This has been a pretty
good honeymoon

42:29.162 --> 42:30.662
when you really think
about it-- I mean, look.

42:30.696 --> 42:32.731
We've been able to taste
the local cuisine,

42:32.765 --> 42:34.966
see the sights,
the local music.

42:35.001 --> 42:36.201
♪ Chacka-chacka-ah ♪

42:36.235 --> 42:37.502
♪ Chacka-ah. ♪
Right?

42:37.537 --> 42:38.904
Catch a Nazi-killer.

42:38.938 --> 42:40.272
We didn't catch
a Nazi killer.

42:40.306 --> 42:42.307
We caught a killer
of a Nazi.

42:42.341 --> 42:43.675
That's, uh, that's
what I meant.

42:43.709 --> 42:45.444
It was ambiguous.
Well, okay.

42:45.478 --> 42:47.112
It was ambiguous.
Hydrate!

42:47.146 --> 42:49.080
Hydrate.

42:51.651 --> 42:53.418
For our second honeymoon,

42:53.453 --> 42:55.754
we could go somewhere
with a prominent sports team.

42:55.788 --> 42:57.222
Wow, I like that. Okay.

42:57.256 --> 42:58.857
You really do
love me, don't you?

42:58.891 --> 43:02.127
I think for my next book,
Agent Andy Lister could die.

43:02.161 --> 43:04.563
No, they would just, you know,
make him a saint, that's all.

43:04.597 --> 43:06.765
Hydrate, hydrate. Hydration,
yeah? Hold it, hold it.
