00:00.456 --> 00:01.756
Before there was sex...

00:01.758 --> 00:04.306
before there was the city,
there was just me,

00:04.426 --> 00:07.194
Carrie... Carrie Bradshaw
from Castlebury, Connecticut.

00:07.196 --> 00:09.367
Hey! Martin is a good friend
of my ex Eric.

00:09.487 --> 00:11.965
So you haven't heard? Eric is
dying of AIDS.

00:12.085 --> 00:12.652
Oh, my God.

00:12.772 --> 00:14.568
I knew this was gonna be hard,
coming out.

00:14.570 --> 00:16.436
So what are you saying?
I can't do this.

00:16.438 --> 00:18.171
I called my dad this morning.

00:18.173 --> 00:19.506
We both agreed
that our relationship

00:19.508 --> 00:21.074
probably works better
long-distance.

00:21.076 --> 00:22.475
Am I in the right place?

00:22.477 --> 00:24.044
I just fixed up the place
a little bit,

00:24.046 --> 00:25.445
put my own stamp on it.

00:25.447 --> 00:27.714
- You joined the army?!
- You have to help me out of this.

00:27.716 --> 00:29.249
I'm going to come up
with a plan.

00:29.251 --> 00:31.051
I'm going to find your file
and rip it up myself.

00:31.053 --> 00:33.253
Just what the hell do you think
you're doing?

00:33.255 --> 00:35.555
Do you wanna take our names?
Just yours. And your number?

00:35.557 --> 00:36.790
I think there's a market
out there

00:36.792 --> 00:38.058
that hasn't been tapped into.

00:38.060 --> 00:40.660
Like shoes, clothes,
all based on skate culture.

00:40.662 --> 00:42.662
I'm really excited
about this, Carrie.

00:42.664 --> 00:45.698
Well, then that sounds
uh, sick.

00:45.700 --> 00:49.269
The Carrie Diaries 02x11
Hungry Like A Wolf
Originally Aired January 17, 2014

00:52.073 --> 00:53.573
I love this park.

00:53.825 --> 00:56.459
Where else do break dancers,
drug dealers, and dog walkers

00:56.461 --> 00:57.994
find so much common ground?

00:57.996 --> 01:00.029
Let's not forget
N.Y.U. students.

01:00.031 --> 01:01.631
Mm, no. Let's forget.

01:01.633 --> 01:04.132
It's actually diabolical
that colleges send out

01:04.135 --> 01:06.602
their acceptance
or rejection letters

01:06.604 --> 01:07.703
during spring break.

01:07.705 --> 01:10.106
There's just...
not enough distractions.

01:10.108 --> 01:12.608
You don't need a distraction.
You're getting into N.Y.U.

01:12.610 --> 01:13.976
Or not.

01:13.978 --> 01:15.912
Hmm, lucky for us,
it looks like

01:15.914 --> 01:18.047
there's a distraction
right at our feet.

01:18.049 --> 01:20.216
What do you think it is?
Art installation?

01:20.218 --> 01:21.884
Skateboarders?

01:21.886 --> 01:24.120
Maybe that kung fu stand-up
comedy guy?

01:26.124 --> 01:27.823
Whatever it is, I'm sure
it'll get my mind off

01:27.825 --> 01:32.428
this dog-eat-dog world of college
admissions.

01:32.430 --> 01:33.929
Oh.

01:33.931 --> 01:35.264
Is that a...

01:35.266 --> 01:37.333
Hawk?

01:37.335 --> 01:38.934
Is it eating a...

01:38.936 --> 01:41.504
A pigeon? Yeah.

01:41.506 --> 01:45.307
I'm not sure whether
to throw up or take a picture.

01:47.011 --> 01:48.244
♪ Word up

01:48.246 --> 01:51.313

01:56.087 --> 01:58.587
It was totally the last thing
you'd expect to see

01:58.589 --> 01:59.688
in the middle of a chic,

01:59.690 --> 02:01.357
sophisticated city
like New York.

02:01.359 --> 02:05.360
An animal eating another animal.
And... and two birds, no less.

02:05.362 --> 02:06.462
Hmm.

02:06.464 --> 02:07.796
It's bird-eat-bird
out there.

02:07.798 --> 02:09.398
Well,
I don't know if you noticed,

02:09.400 --> 02:10.933
Carrie, but that kind of thing

02:10.935 --> 02:12.634
happens in they all the time.

02:12.636 --> 02:14.203
It's kind of a savage place.

02:14.205 --> 02:16.772
Dad, it's not like
it's the 1970s anymore.

02:16.774 --> 02:18.173
They caught son of Sam.

02:18.175 --> 02:20.576
Or did they?

02:20.578 --> 02:21.677
I'm just saying.

02:21.679 --> 02:23.879
I'm just saying you kinda
have to develop

02:23.881 --> 02:26.248
a killer instinct
to survive in Manhattan.

02:26.250 --> 02:28.350
I mean, here,
I'm a pretty nice guy.

02:28.352 --> 02:31.553
But in the city, especially
before I go into a negotiation,

02:31.555 --> 02:34.389
I have
to put on a different face.

02:34.391 --> 02:36.425
I am a lean, mean
killing machine.

02:36.427 --> 02:37.392
Seriously, dad?

02:37.394 --> 02:38.927
No one would ever buy that.

02:38.929 --> 02:40.362
What? That I'm a nice guy?

02:40.364 --> 02:41.863
That you're a killing machine.

02:41.865 --> 02:44.099
Well, I am.

02:47.838 --> 02:49.437
The mail's here.

02:55.879 --> 02:58.380
It's from N.Y.U.,
and it's big.

02:58.382 --> 02:59.481
Big is good.

02:59.483 --> 03:01.316
Or maybe it's a really long
rejection letter.

03:01.318 --> 03:03.652
Everyone knows whatthick.

03:03.654 --> 03:05.854
Aah! I got in!

03:05.856 --> 03:07.889
Oh! That's great! Oh!

03:07.891 --> 03:09.391
That's so good.

03:09.393 --> 03:10.658
I guess now you're gonna
have to develop

03:10.660 --> 03:12.961
that Manhattan killer instinct
after all.

03:12.963 --> 03:14.629
Well, maybe it's that way
at the law firm,

03:14.631 --> 03:16.898
but I'm going into
the writing program.

03:16.900 --> 03:18.133
In the creative fields,

03:18.135 --> 03:19.968
we're a lot more supportive
of each other.

03:19.970 --> 03:22.437
I'm gonna tear Bennet's body
limb from limb.

03:22.439 --> 03:23.872
Where the bloody hell is he?

03:23.874 --> 03:26.674
This is the fifth day in a row
he's blown off work.

03:26.676 --> 03:27.709
Maybe he's sick?

03:27.711 --> 03:29.110
He left a message saying

03:29.112 --> 03:31.646
that he was out late
interviewing someone.

03:31.648 --> 03:33.481
Oh, bollocks! Bennet was
out late clubbing,

03:33.483 --> 03:35.183
which I'd understand if he was
getting good material.

03:35.185 --> 03:36.384
But he's not.

03:36.386 --> 03:40.788
He has gone through a lot.
He and Walt broke up,

03:40.790 --> 03:43.157
and he found out
his ex-boyfriend has AIDS.

03:43.159 --> 03:45.793
I guess he's just blowing off
a little bit of steam.

03:45.795 --> 03:47.829
Look, I feel for Bennet.
I really do.

03:47.831 --> 03:50.465
I mean, I go to three funerals
a month these days.

03:50.467 --> 03:52.400
Which is why I gave him
some time off to deal,

03:52.402 --> 03:53.601
but it's been weeks.

03:53.603 --> 03:55.837
And I'm starting to feel
taken advantage of.

03:55.839 --> 03:57.472
So, if you see Bennet,

03:57.474 --> 03:59.574
tell him I want his 500 words

03:59.576 --> 04:01.976
on parachute pants
by end of day,

04:01.978 --> 04:03.611
or he is out on his ass.

04:03.613 --> 04:06.180
He will do it. I promise.

04:07.449 --> 04:10.451
Bennet, it's Carrie, again.
Larissa is expecting

04:10.453 --> 04:12.486
the parachute pants piece
on her desk by 6:00.

04:12.488 --> 04:14.755
So, call me.

04:17.192 --> 04:18.692
What you doin'?

04:18.695 --> 04:19.860
Working.

04:19.862 --> 04:21.062
Or trying to.

04:21.064 --> 04:22.830
More like trying to get Bennet
to do his work.

04:22.832 --> 04:24.031
Didn't show up again?

04:24.033 --> 04:26.500
No, and I can't reach him.
I'm starting to worry.

04:26.502 --> 04:28.102
Well, you might have to worry
about Bennet,

04:28.104 --> 04:30.404
but you don't have to worry
about me anymore.

04:30.406 --> 04:31.705
I got a new job.

04:31.707 --> 04:33.474
That's great.
What are you doing?

04:33.476 --> 04:36.377
Looking for this little guy.

04:36.379 --> 04:39.313
How exactly is looking
for a parakeet a job?

04:39.315 --> 04:41.282
It pays 500 bucks.
Tax-free.

04:41.284 --> 04:44.184
You actually think
you're gonna find that bird?

04:44.186 --> 04:46.353
I've got a good eye,
and I'm quick on my feet.

04:46.355 --> 04:48.222
I used to catch the flamingos
that ran away

04:48.224 --> 04:49.723
from my Uncle's farm
in Florida.

04:49.725 --> 04:51.358
Your Uncle raised flamingos?

04:51.360 --> 04:52.726
And made crank.

04:53.829 --> 04:55.262
Anyway, can I use
your copy machine or what?

04:55.264 --> 04:57.231
Yeah, sure.

04:57.233 --> 04:58.832
But how are you gonna
get the reward

04:58.834 --> 05:00.334
if you just make more flyers?

05:00.336 --> 05:02.970
Oh, no, I'm making new flyers
with my name and number on 'em

05:02.972 --> 05:04.571
and lowering the reward to $50.

05:04.573 --> 05:07.908
If someone else finds him,
they'll get... something.

05:07.910 --> 05:09.109
It's win-win for everyone.

05:09.111 --> 05:11.879
Except I win
an eensey bit more.

05:11.881 --> 05:13.780
I seriously doubt
that tiny bird

05:13.782 --> 05:16.550
is going to survive long
on the streets of New York.

05:16.552 --> 05:18.685
I mean, I saw a hawk
eating a pigeon

05:18.687 --> 05:20.087
in Washington Square Park.

05:20.089 --> 05:22.990
And a pigeon is easily
ten times the size of your bird.

05:22.992 --> 05:24.958
All the more reason
I could use a little help.

05:24.960 --> 05:26.259
So what do you say?

05:26.261 --> 05:28.528
That $50 could be yours.

05:28.530 --> 05:29.963
Mm, I'm gonna have to pass.

05:29.965 --> 05:32.065
I have my own bird
to save... Bennet.

05:32.067 --> 05:34.234
And a much better chance of success.

05:34.236 --> 05:36.536
Suit yourself, but it
doesn't sound like

05:36.538 --> 05:39.072
your bird's gonna do his work
anytime soon.

05:39.074 --> 05:42.976
Oh.

05:42.978 --> 05:46.046
Oh...

05:46.048 --> 05:48.048
Maybe I can do it for him.

05:48.050 --> 05:50.584
While I was
helping out a friend,

05:50.586 --> 05:54.054
one of my other friends
was looking for advice.

05:54.056 --> 05:56.423
So, I have to figure
this out ASAP,

05:56.425 --> 05:57.724
since Pete is coming into town

05:57.726 --> 06:01.027
for three days
of spring break...

06:01.029 --> 06:03.730
Which one should I go with?
The white or the black?

06:03.732 --> 06:06.299
'Cause white says,
"sexy, but innocent""

06:06.301 --> 06:09.402
and black says, "hot...
Maybe a little dangerous""

06:09.404 --> 06:12.172
ooh, or...
Should I go with the red?

06:12.174 --> 06:14.808
♪ got to have ya, yeah ♪

06:14.810 --> 06:17.377
What do you think it says?
"Spicy mama"?

06:17.379 --> 06:20.508
Um, it's hard to pick.

06:20.628 --> 06:22.649
They all say such
different things.

06:22.651 --> 06:25.485
I think they all say
the same thing...

06:25.487 --> 06:26.753
Slutty and needy.

06:26.755 --> 06:29.489
Why does it seem like
she is always around these days?

06:29.491 --> 06:32.258
Maggie, Donna's an expert
on all things male,

06:32.260 --> 06:35.061
and right now you could use
all the help you can get.

06:35.063 --> 06:37.430
What do you mean, I can use
all the help I can get?

06:37.432 --> 06:40.433
Because you have terrible
instincts when it comes to sex.

06:40.435 --> 06:42.902
Look, she's harsh,
but she's telling the truth.

06:42.904 --> 06:45.638
You do tend to confuse sex and love.

06:45.640 --> 06:48.174
We just wanna help you
with Pete.

06:48.176 --> 06:50.176
He just seems so great and...

06:50.178 --> 06:53.346
And we don't want you
to screw it up with him, too.

06:53.348 --> 06:55.414
I mean, I don't care
either way, really.

06:55.416 --> 06:58.284
But I'm guessing military man
might have some hot friends.

06:58.286 --> 07:00.486
And I will expect
one in return for the...

07:00.488 --> 07:02.188
words of wisdom I dole out.

07:02.190 --> 07:04.523
So what should I do?

07:04.525 --> 07:07.360
Wear ugly underwear
like granny panties

07:07.362 --> 07:08.761
and don't shave your legs.

07:08.763 --> 07:10.696
What's that gonna do
other than gross him out?

07:10.698 --> 07:12.431
It's not for him.
It's for you.

07:12.433 --> 07:14.633
It'll force you
to keep your pants on.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.435
So he won't see
your stubbly legs

07:16.437 --> 07:17.570
or your control top.

07:17.572 --> 07:18.904
Or your period underwear.

07:18.906 --> 07:20.239
Mouse, let me handle this.

07:20.241 --> 07:21.607
Right, right, of course.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.476
You need to create a situation
where you won't just

07:23.478 --> 07:25.377
hop into bed with him
the minute he gets here.

07:25.379 --> 07:30.149
But I'm... attracted to him.
I wanna have sex with him.

07:30.151 --> 07:33.118
Except it kind of feels like
after you have sex with a guy...

07:33.120 --> 07:35.721
- You totally blow it. So...
-  No sex for you.

07:35.723 --> 07:36.655
Well...

07:36.657 --> 07:38.712
Most guys won't wait forever.

07:38.832 --> 07:40.593
How long am I supposed
to do this?

07:40.595 --> 07:42.695
Until he really likes you
for you,

07:42.697 --> 07:44.830
instead of
because you're slutty.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.398
Okay, that was too harsh.

07:46.400 --> 07:47.800
Mm.

07:47.802 --> 07:50.269
Sadly, she's probably right.

07:54.408 --> 07:56.542
Have you seen Bennet
this morning?

07:56.544 --> 08:00.846
No, I guess he was working late
on the parachute pants piece.

08:00.848 --> 08:02.981
- Did you get it?
- I did.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.217
And I wanted to tell him
it's the best piece

08:05.219 --> 08:06.351
he's written in months.

08:06.353 --> 08:08.587
You liked it?
I mean, it is?

08:08.589 --> 08:11.356
If you talk to him,
tell him I'm impressed.

08:11.358 --> 08:12.858
I sure will.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.193
Maybe even call him
and let him know.

08:15.195 --> 08:19.364
You bet. I will do that.
I will call him.

08:22.935 --> 08:24.336
It dawned on me
that someone else

08:24.338 --> 08:27.406
was getting credit for my work.

08:27.408 --> 08:31.309
And I realized
I didn't like it.

08:33.000 --> 08:39.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:40.825 --> 08:42.380
Is it awful that
I'm a little bitter

08:42.409 --> 08:45.277
that I did all the work
and Bennet got all the credit?

08:45.279 --> 08:47.413
You have to look at it
like loaning money.

08:47.415 --> 08:49.381
You shouldn't do it
if you need it back,

08:49.383 --> 08:50.883
'cause then it'll just
make you mad

08:50.885 --> 08:51.951
if they don't pay you.

08:51.953 --> 08:53.819
Which, is pretty much always.

08:53.821 --> 08:55.387
When you do something generous,

08:55.389 --> 08:57.122
you can't want anything
in return.

08:57.124 --> 09:01.093
I worry that maybe I'm not
as good a person as you are.

09:01.095 --> 09:04.229
I mean, isn't that why
they call it a loan? Not a gift?

09:04.231 --> 09:05.664
What if Larissa
hadn't liked it?

09:05.666 --> 09:07.399
Would you be willing
to take the blame?

09:07.401 --> 09:09.401
I don't know.

09:09.403 --> 09:11.470
But the point is,
she did like it... a lot.

09:12.807 --> 09:15.040
Are you expecting company
or something?

09:15.042 --> 09:16.341
Huh?

09:16.343 --> 09:19.178
You keep straightening up
and fussing with everything.

09:19.180 --> 09:21.547
What's going on?

09:21.549 --> 09:23.949
My, uh, dad's coming to town.

09:23.951 --> 09:27.219
He said he wants to come by,
see me, check out the loft.

09:27.221 --> 09:28.387
Really?

09:28.389 --> 09:30.022
How long's he in New York?

09:30.024 --> 09:31.123
I don't know.

09:31.125 --> 09:33.225
He was never much
on the details.

09:33.227 --> 09:34.526
Do you know why he's here?

09:34.528 --> 09:36.995
It's... it's nice he's coming by
to see the place.

09:36.997 --> 09:40.465
I'm guessing for business,
but he didn't say.

09:40.467 --> 09:42.167
Knowing him, he'll probably

09:42.169 --> 09:44.569
forget to show up
like he always does.

09:46.105 --> 09:47.472
Emily Dickinson said,

09:47.474 --> 09:49.875
"hope is the thing
with feathers."

09:49.877 --> 09:53.211
And Sebastian wasn't
the only one chasing it.

09:53.213 --> 09:57.115
Samantha was, too.

09:57.117 --> 09:59.050
Oh!

09:59.052 --> 10:00.852
Whoa, you okay?

10:00.854 --> 10:03.755
Yeah, it's just my flyers.

10:05.659 --> 10:07.692
- There you go.
- Thanks.

10:07.694 --> 10:09.961
Guess you lost your bird, huh?

10:09.963 --> 10:10.929
Well, he's not my bird.

10:10.931 --> 10:14.499
But I'm trying to help
find him.

10:15.868 --> 10:17.669
His name's Gabriel.

10:17.671 --> 10:19.704
I like that you're looking
for a friend's bird.

10:19.706 --> 10:20.972
That... that's so...

10:20.974 --> 10:22.040
Silly?

10:22.042 --> 10:24.542
I was gonna say nurturing.

10:24.544 --> 10:28.313
Oh.

10:28.315 --> 10:31.382
I've got a pretty good view
of the neighborhood

10:31.384 --> 10:35.053
from my place if you want
to try and spot him from there.

10:35.055 --> 10:39.491
Oh...
I couldn't.

10:39.493 --> 10:43.561
I might have a bottle
of rosé in the fridge.

10:44.942 --> 10:46.910
All right.

10:46.912 --> 10:48.845
For Gabriel's sake.

10:53.217 --> 10:54.651
Meanwhile,
my dad was working on

10:54.653 --> 10:58.722
getting his own offer ready...
the business kind.

11:02.794 --> 11:06.396
Oh, oh, no. I thought
I had a couple more minutes.

11:06.398 --> 11:07.897
It's 11:00.

11:07.899 --> 11:11.401
Oh. Uh, you must be from
Ritz, Siegel, and Cohen.

11:11.403 --> 11:12.802
Penny. Hi.

11:12.804 --> 11:15.105
- You must be Tim?
- Tom.

11:15.107 --> 11:19.609
- Tom... oh, I'm... I'm so sorry.
- I'm just chaos today.

11:19.611 --> 11:24.380
Oh, no. No, no, no!

11:24.382 --> 11:26.182
Um, c-can I help?

11:26.184 --> 11:27.617
Uh, no, I'm good.

11:27.619 --> 11:30.253
Uh, maybe if you tell me
what you're looking for,

11:30.255 --> 11:31.287
I think...

11:31.289 --> 11:32.655
Uh, my glasses!

11:32.657 --> 11:35.258
I'm always losing them,
and I can't find them anywhere.

11:35.260 --> 11:36.859
Um...

11:36.861 --> 11:37.894
Huh?

11:41.399 --> 11:44.067
Oh, sorry.

11:44.069 --> 11:46.202
I'm sure this wasn't
what you were

11:46.204 --> 11:48.771
expecting to be
dealing with this morning.

11:48.773 --> 11:52.141
I'm new to this deal,
and I overslept so...

11:52.143 --> 11:54.677
It's been kind of a total
disaster of a morning for me.

11:54.679 --> 11:56.746
I hate when this happens.

11:56.748 --> 11:59.182
Does it happen a lot?
Yeah, uh, why don't you just

11:59.184 --> 12:01.851
take a minute and, uh,
uh, get yourself organized?

12:01.853 --> 12:03.219
I won't start without you.

12:03.221 --> 12:05.755
Thank you.

12:05.757 --> 12:06.856
Ooh!
Ow.

12:06.858 --> 12:08.391
- Whoa.
- I'm so sorry.

12:08.393 --> 12:10.626
- Uh, no, no.
- Here, let me. Let me. It's okay.

12:10.628 --> 12:12.028
- Oh, no. Sorry!
- It's okay. It's okay.

12:13.231 --> 12:15.298
Oh, God.

12:15.300 --> 12:16.966
Oh, God.

12:16.968 --> 12:18.801
I-I-I-I'm still wearing
my contacts from last night.

12:18.803 --> 12:20.536
Then why do you have
your glasses?

12:20.538 --> 12:22.938
Why do I have my glasses?
I'm wearing my contacts.

12:22.940 --> 12:25.307
No wonder I couldn't
see anything this morning.

12:25.309 --> 12:26.776
Oh!

12:26.778 --> 12:27.910
And now my eyes
are burning like crazy.

12:27.912 --> 12:29.779
I'll be right back.

12:29.781 --> 12:31.680
While my dad found
he didn't really need

12:31.682 --> 12:33.449
his killer instincts
like he thought,

12:33.451 --> 12:39.288
Maggie was working hard
to keep her instincts in check.

12:41.057 --> 12:42.358
Hi.

12:46.730 --> 12:48.097
Wow.

12:48.099 --> 12:49.365
You're dressed up
for a bus ride.

12:49.367 --> 12:51.667
Yeah, I thought we could
go out for dinner tonight,

12:51.669 --> 12:52.801
have a proper date.

12:52.803 --> 12:54.336
Sure, I could eat.

12:54.338 --> 12:55.537
If you wanna go home
and change first,

12:55.539 --> 12:56.472
we could do that.

12:56.474 --> 12:58.507
Why? I'm comfortable
like this.

12:58.509 --> 13:00.609
And you look great.
It's just...

13:00.611 --> 13:03.278
I made a reservation
at the Normandie Inn,

13:03.280 --> 13:06.215
and I'm not sure
they allow jeans.

13:06.217 --> 13:08.484
The Normandie Inn?
That place is so romantic.

13:08.486 --> 13:10.586
Yeah, that's what I heard.
I asked around,

13:10.588 --> 13:12.221
wanted tonight to be special.

13:12.223 --> 13:14.923
So I thought we could
take a walk around the lake,

13:14.925 --> 13:17.059
and then go grab dinner?

13:17.061 --> 13:21.863
You know what?
I'm starving now.

13:21.865 --> 13:22.965
But it's only 4:00.

13:22.967 --> 13:25.000
The restaurant isn't even
open yet.

13:25.002 --> 13:26.535
That place isn't even
that great.

13:26.537 --> 13:28.892
The food's kind of fatty.
I have a way better idea.

13:29.012 --> 13:30.115
You'll love it.

13:31.441 --> 13:34.276
Wait. You wrote
my piece for me?

13:34.278 --> 13:36.711
Yeah, I also took
your messages and scheduled

13:36.713 --> 13:38.780
three appointments
for you for next week.

13:38.782 --> 13:41.616
Uh, two restaurant openings
and a benefit for the met.

13:41.618 --> 13:45.453
Wow, Carrie, thanks.
That was really cool of you.

13:45.455 --> 13:46.955
I owe you big-time.

13:46.957 --> 13:48.390
You're welcome.

13:48.392 --> 13:50.358
I just... didn't want you
to get in trouble with Larissa.

13:50.360 --> 13:52.360
She really liked
the piece, by the way.

13:52.362 --> 13:54.796
Oh, that's terrific.

13:54.798 --> 13:56.831
Look, if I can ever
return the favor, let me know.

13:56.833 --> 13:59.000
Hey,
I'm... I'm really grateful.

13:59.002 --> 14:00.368
Okay.

14:05.374 --> 14:06.808
Bennet.

14:06.810 --> 14:09.411
Great piece on parachute pants.

14:09.413 --> 14:10.678
Timely and funny.

14:10.680 --> 14:14.516
I'm... glad you liked it.
I worked really hard on it.

14:14.518 --> 14:16.951
I should let you do
all your work from home

14:16.953 --> 14:18.286
if that's the quality
you turn in.

14:18.288 --> 14:20.688
Sounds good to me.

14:29.765 --> 14:31.332
Hey.

14:31.334 --> 14:32.634
You and I need to talk.

14:32.636 --> 14:34.202
Now.

14:43.369 --> 14:45.291
Did you seriously
have to do that?

14:45.411 --> 14:46.486
Do what?

14:46.606 --> 14:48.755
Tell Larissa that
you worked really hard

14:48.875 --> 14:50.975
- on the parachute pants piece.
- I don't understand.

14:50.977 --> 14:52.261
You're the one who told her
I wrote it in the first place.

14:52.279 --> 14:54.212
Yeah, but you didn't have
to brag about it.

14:54.214 --> 14:55.547
I'm sorry. I thought
I should probably

14:55.549 --> 14:56.648
act like I was proud of it,

14:56.650 --> 14:58.316
because if Larissa knew
I hadn't written it...

14:59.519 --> 15:02.887
Okay, yeah, but would it
have killed you to maybe

15:02.889 --> 15:05.390
have given me at least
a little credit?

15:05.392 --> 15:07.559
I don't know.
Told her I was helpful

15:07.561 --> 15:10.395
- or did side research or something.
-  - Look, I really meant it

15:10.397 --> 15:11.696
when I said I was grateful.

15:11.698 --> 15:14.165
I didn't mean to make it
seem like I wasn't.

15:14.167 --> 15:16.134
I'm just...

15:16.136 --> 15:18.603
I'm not really picking up
on things lately.

15:18.605 --> 15:20.605
I think my head's foggy

15:20.607 --> 15:23.074
because I'm dealing
with so much.

15:23.076 --> 15:26.244
No, it's fine.
I'm being ridiculous.

15:26.246 --> 15:29.213
I'm... I'm sorry.
I totally get it.

15:29.215 --> 15:30.448
Oh, I know you do,

15:30.450 --> 15:32.550
and that's what makes you
such a great friend.

15:33.752 --> 15:35.620
Just...

15:35.622 --> 15:36.888
I can't be here.
It's too hard.

15:36.890 --> 15:38.389
I just, I wanna go home
and curl up

15:38.391 --> 15:40.191
and forget all my troubles.

15:40.193 --> 15:41.159
Well, at least make sure

15:41.161 --> 15:42.426
you take some of your work
with you.

15:42.428 --> 15:43.528
I don't want you to get

15:43.530 --> 15:45.096
in any more trouble
with Larissa.

15:45.098 --> 15:46.931
Thanks, but I should
be good tonight.

15:46.933 --> 15:47.932
My calendar's clear.

15:47.934 --> 15:49.834
I'm just gonna go home
and crash.

15:49.836 --> 15:51.702
Okay.

15:55.307 --> 15:57.441
I still have some
serious reservations

15:57.443 --> 15:59.143
about these projected earnings,

15:59.145 --> 16:01.078
especially considering
your client's recent deal

16:01.080 --> 16:02.680
with Bell Atlantic.

16:02.682 --> 16:06.183
Uh... why?

16:06.185 --> 16:07.918
There's nothing wrong
with that deal.

16:07.920 --> 16:10.154
I've heard from reliable sources
that it may not go through,

16:10.156 --> 16:13.390
which would change the stock
valuation considerably.

16:13.392 --> 16:16.260
I don't know where you're
getting that information,

16:16.262 --> 16:18.429
but only a few people
in the company

16:18.431 --> 16:20.397
have seen
those internal numbers.

16:20.399 --> 16:24.768
My job as Meridien's counsel
is to know these things.

16:35.780 --> 16:37.214
You worked me.

16:37.216 --> 16:38.582
I don't know
what you're talking about.

16:38.584 --> 16:40.150
That klutzy move
with the papers...

16:40.152 --> 16:41.819
You used it to grab
my merger file.

16:41.821 --> 16:44.188
That's why you know
all the problems with the deal.

16:46.559 --> 16:48.625
Must've gotten mixed up
with mine.

16:48.627 --> 16:50.694
An honest mistake.

16:51.997 --> 16:55.833
Look, Tom, you could get mad
about this, make a big stink,

16:55.835 --> 16:59.269
but that would mean
that you would have to tell

16:59.271 --> 17:03.273
your client that you let me see
their confidential file.

17:03.275 --> 17:08.645
I bet you don't even
wear glasses.

17:08.646 --> 17:10.747
Mmm.

17:10.749 --> 17:12.715
Can't believe
you're eating those.

17:12.718 --> 17:14.451
Yeah. I told you,
they're delicious.

17:14.453 --> 17:16.453
Here. Try some.

17:16.454 --> 17:20.624
Maybe later.

17:20.626 --> 17:23.393
We're probably the only people
on a date in this place,

17:23.395 --> 17:25.762
at 4:45 in the afternoon.

17:25.763 --> 17:27.531
 Yeah, well, I mean,
you know, it's not really

17:27.532 --> 17:30.066
a date-type place.
But, buh...

17:30.068 --> 17:31.768
I thought you'd wanna see
where I hang out.

17:31.770 --> 17:33.570
Yeah, of course.
Sure.

17:33.572 --> 17:36.806
But it would be nice
to have some alone time

17:36.808 --> 17:39.109
with you, too, if you want.

17:40.946 --> 17:43.546
Um, yeah, listen, Pete,
I-I really...

17:43.548 --> 17:45.248
Maggie?!

17:46.217 --> 17:48.451
I didn't know you were
going to be here.

17:48.453 --> 17:50.754
Yeah, I'm just getting
some dinner with Pete.

17:50.756 --> 17:52.255
You remember Pete, right?

17:52.257 --> 17:53.556
Of course!

17:53.558 --> 17:56.126
Great to see you again.

17:56.128 --> 18:00.296
Hey, mind if I join you guys?
I'm not interrupting, am I?

18:00.298 --> 18:02.765
No! Of course not.
We have plenty of room.

18:02.767 --> 18:04.601
Scoot over... Pete.

18:04.603 --> 18:05.702
Ooh!

18:05.704 --> 18:08.238
Chili cheese fries!
Awesome!

18:08.240 --> 18:09.639
Mmm.

18:13.744 --> 18:15.211
Hey, Lyle.
Is that for Bennet?

18:15.213 --> 18:16.779
Yeah, it's tickets

18:16.781 --> 18:18.381
to the National Theater
Ballet Gala for tonight.

18:18.383 --> 18:20.116
He's going to be interviewing
some Prima Ballerina

18:20.118 --> 18:21.417
for the magazine.

18:21.419 --> 18:22.986
Oh, he must've forgotten.

18:22.988 --> 18:24.954
He wasn't feeling well
and went home to get some sleep.

18:24.956 --> 18:28.057
Um, I just saw him at da Silvano
about 20 minutes ago

18:28.059 --> 18:30.960
with a bottle of prosecco
and a boy on each arm.

18:30.962 --> 18:32.728
Are you serious?

18:32.730 --> 18:33.930
Yeah, that guy is screwing up
right and left,

18:33.932 --> 18:35.465
and Larissa is gonna be pissed

18:35.467 --> 18:37.266
if he doesn't get
to that gala tonight...

18:37.268 --> 18:39.001
Or shows up drunk to it.

18:49.580 --> 18:52.815
Hi. I'm calling
from "Interview" Magazine.

18:52.817 --> 18:54.684
Right. Uh, actually,

18:54.686 --> 18:57.253
we're sending
a different writer instead.

18:57.255 --> 19:01.057
Carrie Bradshaw.
Plus one.

19:17.088 --> 19:18.121
Wow.

19:18.123 --> 19:19.589
This place is splashy.

19:19.591 --> 19:21.758
I know.
Bennet would love this.

19:21.760 --> 19:24.094
I'm a terrible person.
What am I doing here?

19:24.096 --> 19:25.829
Uh, your job.

19:25.831 --> 19:29.533
No, I'm doing Bennet's job.
I totally stole his assignment.

19:29.535 --> 19:31.134
Maybe, I'll just do
the interview

19:31.136 --> 19:32.402
and let him write the piece.

19:32.404 --> 19:34.671
You're not stealing this.
He dropped it.

19:34.673 --> 19:36.606
You just picked it up.

19:36.608 --> 19:40.277
And I'm picking up these.

19:40.279 --> 19:41.778
All right, now tell me again
about the skinny bitch

19:41.780 --> 19:43.380
you're supposed to interview.

19:43.382 --> 19:44.915
Amelia Strong.

19:44.917 --> 19:47.450
She's a 17-year-old
Prima Ballerina...

19:47.452 --> 19:49.386
the youngest ballerina
to ever play the black swan

19:49.388 --> 19:51.221
in "Swan Lake."

19:51.223 --> 19:53.423
Feels like the world
is nothing but birds...

19:53.425 --> 19:56.292
Swans, my little Gabriel.

19:56.294 --> 19:57.494
Still haven't found him, huh?

19:57.496 --> 19:58.695
No.

19:58.697 --> 20:00.730
But I did find a man
while I was looking for him.

20:00.732 --> 20:02.999
Oh, and did you get a reward
for finding him?

20:03.001 --> 20:04.234
Yes, I did.

20:04.236 --> 20:06.369
Several orgasms while
calling out his name.

20:06.371 --> 20:08.738
Elliot.

20:08.740 --> 20:10.039
And he's adorable.

20:10.041 --> 20:13.209
He's getting his PhD at N.Y.U.
In something science-y.

20:13.211 --> 20:14.744
You learned
that much about him?

20:14.746 --> 20:17.013
I thought you liked mystery
when it came to your men?

20:17.015 --> 20:18.114
Normally, I do.

20:18.116 --> 20:20.216
But with Elliot,
my usual instincts

20:20.218 --> 20:22.285
just go out the window.

20:22.287 --> 20:23.519
And I wanna nest.

20:23.521 --> 20:25.154
He says it's because
of his pheromones.

20:25.156 --> 20:26.823
I'm not sure,
but whatever it is,

20:26.825 --> 20:28.591
I'm drawn to him.

20:29.460 --> 20:32.562
Oh, my God.
There he is!

20:32.564 --> 20:34.497
- Who?
- Elliot!

20:34.499 --> 20:36.432
Maybe you are drawn to him.

20:36.434 --> 20:38.868
Come on.
I'll introduce you to him.

20:38.870 --> 20:41.137
Elliot!

20:41.139 --> 20:42.972
I didn't know you were
a fan of the ballet.

20:42.974 --> 20:44.640
Samantha.

20:44.642 --> 20:46.375
And this is my friend Carrie.

20:46.377 --> 20:47.643
Nice to meet you, Carrie.

20:48.745 --> 20:50.079
Hey there.

20:50.081 --> 20:52.248
Honey, are you going
to introduce us?

20:52.250 --> 20:55.651
Uh, Samantha, Carrie,
this is my wife Sally.

21:00.497 --> 21:03.292
I mean, seriously. Can you believe
what that woman did

21:03.294 --> 21:04.260
to manipulate me?

21:04.262 --> 21:05.561
I don't know, dad.

21:05.563 --> 21:06.762
You were the one
who was lecturing us

21:06.764 --> 21:07.797
about the killer instinct.

21:07.799 --> 21:09.598
Sounds like you just got played

21:09.600 --> 21:10.900
by someone
with a better one than you.

21:10.902 --> 21:13.169
Yeah, but... she cheated!

21:13.171 --> 21:15.304
I mean, she... she passed herself
off as helpless,

21:15.306 --> 21:16.439
and then bam!

21:16.441 --> 21:18.841
She stole my files
and used them against me.

21:18.843 --> 21:20.176
It's a classic girl move,

21:20.178 --> 21:22.845
like when Carrie fake cries
to get what she wants.

21:22.847 --> 21:24.713
Wait, what?

21:24.715 --> 21:26.448
She doesn't do that.

21:26.450 --> 21:28.551
Oh, please.

21:28.553 --> 21:29.985
Like when she wanted
to go into the city

21:29.987 --> 21:31.320
on a Thursday,
and you said "No"?

21:31.322 --> 21:33.389
Couple tears and expressing
of her feelings,

21:33.391 --> 21:35.491
and you said "Yes"
just to get rid of her.

21:35.493 --> 21:38.560
I'm a total sucker.

21:38.562 --> 21:39.662
Pretty much.

21:39.664 --> 21:41.764
Look, Carrie just uses
what she has

21:41.766 --> 21:44.500
to get what she wants.
Same with this lawyer chick.

21:44.502 --> 21:48.604
Oh, God, you're right.
Man. I'm screwed.

21:50.273 --> 21:52.241
Well, lucky for you,
you have a daughter

21:52.243 --> 21:54.176
who's just as good
at manipulating people

21:54.178 --> 21:55.944
as this lady is.

21:55.946 --> 21:58.380
Wait, what are you...
what are you saying?

21:58.382 --> 22:01.083
That you wanna... to...

22:01.085 --> 22:03.952
no. No, no, no, no, no way.

22:03.954 --> 22:05.254
Look, this lady is willing
to get her hands dirty.

22:05.256 --> 22:06.455
If you want to beat her,

22:06.457 --> 22:08.190
you have to fight
fire with fire.

22:08.192 --> 22:09.291
By using my own daughter?

22:09.293 --> 22:11.326
I'm not sure I'm ready
to stoop that low.

22:11.328 --> 22:13.562
And that's why
it's perfect, dad.

22:13.564 --> 22:16.465
You're uncomfortable with it
because you're a nice guy.

22:16.467 --> 22:18.934
She'll never see it coming.

22:18.936 --> 22:21.136
You scare me sometimes, Dorrit.

22:21.938 --> 22:25.574
I mean it as a compliment.
Sort of.

22:30.714 --> 22:33.148
Are you sure you're okay?

22:33.150 --> 22:34.549
I'm totally fine.

22:34.551 --> 22:37.452
So he's married.
So what?

22:37.454 --> 22:39.187
I don't do relationships
anyway.

22:39.189 --> 22:41.523
I know. It just...

22:41.525 --> 22:43.592
Sounded like
you kinda liked him.

22:43.594 --> 22:45.760
For sex.
It was a fling.

22:45.762 --> 22:48.363
We had a nice conversation
about biology,

22:48.365 --> 22:50.231
but that's all
it was really about for me...

22:50.233 --> 22:51.433
Biology.

22:51.435 --> 22:53.001
Miss Bradshaw?

22:53.003 --> 22:55.013
Amelia's ready to speak to you now.

22:55.133 --> 22:59.240
Now? Okay, uh,
I'll be right with you.

22:59.242 --> 23:02.444
I need to go do this.
Carrie, I'll be fine.

23:02.446 --> 23:04.078
I'll go find myself a hunky...

23:04.080 --> 23:05.413
What do you call
a male ballerina?

23:05.415 --> 23:06.447
Ballerino?

23:06.449 --> 23:08.416
I'll go
find one of those,

23:08.418 --> 23:10.818
and I'll see if he wants
to practice "The Nutcracker"

23:10.820 --> 23:14.155
- mmm.
- Okay.

23:18.194 --> 23:21.029
I gotta say, kid,
this is a nice place.

23:21.031 --> 23:22.730
You're making
a real life for yourself.

23:22.732 --> 23:24.699
I am.

23:24.701 --> 23:26.501
And, uh, I-I've kinda been
trying to start this company

23:26.503 --> 23:28.369
that makes clothing
for skateboarders.

23:28.371 --> 23:29.704
So that's been keeping me busy.

23:29.706 --> 23:32.507
Wow. You're an entrepreneur
like your old man.

23:32.509 --> 23:34.475
I guess I am.

23:34.477 --> 23:36.911
Careful. It can be tricky.
It's worth it,

23:36.913 --> 23:40.348
but you gotta take risks
if you wanna make the big score.

23:41.550 --> 23:43.818
That's actually why I'm here.

23:43.820 --> 23:46.087
To talk about my investment?
How'd you even...

23:46.089 --> 23:47.455
Nah, to talk about mine.

23:47.457 --> 23:51.792
So last year, I put some money
in these high-yield bonds.

23:51.794 --> 23:53.394
And...

23:53.396 --> 23:54.362
It didn't exactly pan out.

23:54.364 --> 23:56.998
So I am light
on liquid capital.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.400
But I gotta get back
in the game.

23:59.402 --> 24:01.569
So...

24:01.571 --> 24:03.337
I'm gonna have to borrow
your trust fund.

24:03.339 --> 24:06.640
Wait. You came
all the way here

24:06.642 --> 24:08.209
to ask me for my money?

24:08.211 --> 24:09.443
Well, that money is mine.

24:09.445 --> 24:11.745
See, I gave it to you,
so I can take it back.

24:11.747 --> 24:14.381
Actually, legally,
it's my money,

24:14.383 --> 24:16.684
which means I get to decide
what happens to it.

24:16.686 --> 24:18.519
Look, it's just
gonna be temporary.

24:18.521 --> 24:19.854
All right? Just to get
the blood-sucking bankers

24:19.856 --> 24:20.988
off my back.

24:20.990 --> 24:23.057
And what have
they ever created?

24:23.059 --> 24:24.491
They're just living
off of guys like me,

24:24.493 --> 24:25.893
and now they won't
give me what I need

24:25.895 --> 24:27.061
to make it back.

24:27.063 --> 24:29.096
Maybe they're worried
you'll lose it again.

24:29.098 --> 24:32.566
What, you think
this is easy for me...

24:32.568 --> 24:35.336
come here looking for help?

24:35.338 --> 24:37.738
It's not.

24:39.708 --> 24:41.909
You know, I've always
tried to be there for you.

24:41.911 --> 24:43.043
I was off making the money,

24:43.045 --> 24:46.313
they money that is in
that trust fund.

24:46.315 --> 24:50.250
I guess I hoped that you'd
be there for me now.

24:52.520 --> 24:56.890
Well... it's up to you now,
isn't it?

25:09.671 --> 25:13.173
Excuse me, Amelia?

25:13.175 --> 25:14.941
Let me guess.
You want to audition,

25:14.943 --> 25:16.576
and you're looking for advice.

25:16.578 --> 25:18.745
Well, I don't know
what to tell you,

25:18.747 --> 25:20.113
except maybe lose 20 pounds

25:20.115 --> 25:21.548
and sleep
with the choreographer.

25:21.550 --> 25:23.783
Actually, I'm not a dancer.
I'm a journalist.

25:23.785 --> 25:25.986
I'm from "Interview" Magazine.

25:25.988 --> 25:28.088
They told me you were ready
to talk to me.

25:28.090 --> 25:29.389
Wait, you're from "Interview"?

25:29.391 --> 25:31.691
I'm sorry.
I didn't think you...

25:31.693 --> 25:33.627
I mean, you're so young.

25:33.629 --> 25:35.729
Well, I could say
the same thing about you.

25:35.731 --> 25:38.098
I'm 17. In this business,
that's about a year away

25:38.100 --> 25:39.566
from being pushed out.

25:40.901 --> 25:42.836
And here I was, expecting
I would have to talk

25:42.838 --> 25:44.371
to some old person.

25:44.373 --> 25:46.539
Nope, just me.

25:46.541 --> 25:48.308
Cool.

25:51.313 --> 25:55.315
Look, I want to apologize.

25:55.317 --> 25:57.650
- No need.
- It's just...

25:57.652 --> 25:59.185
It's not what it looks like.

25:59.187 --> 26:00.553
Oh, it's not?

26:00.555 --> 26:02.288
Because it looks like
you're married.

26:02.290 --> 26:05.825
Yes, but it's an open marriage.

26:05.827 --> 26:09.262
We both want to be
with other people.

26:09.264 --> 26:11.698
Really?

26:11.700 --> 26:15.501
That's not just a lie
so you don't look like a snake?

26:15.503 --> 26:17.370
No. It's the truth.

26:17.372 --> 26:19.639
And I'm sorry that I didn't
mention it before.

26:19.641 --> 26:21.774
Honestly, it's still
sort of confusing,

26:21.776 --> 26:24.644
trying to figure out
how to explain it to people.

26:24.646 --> 26:27.547
I think it's intriguing.

26:27.549 --> 26:30.083
Honey, we should probably
get going soon.

26:30.085 --> 26:31.451
Hi, Sally...

26:31.453 --> 26:33.853
I should apologize for
the way I ran off before.

26:33.855 --> 26:35.021
I'm Samantha.

26:35.023 --> 26:36.556
I'm having sex
with your husband.

26:44.264 --> 26:46.132
My wife doesn't usually
meet the people

26:46.134 --> 26:47.433
I'm sleeping with.

26:47.435 --> 26:50.136
Oh, dear.

26:50.138 --> 26:51.470
Sorry about that.

26:51.472 --> 26:53.272
It's fine.

26:53.274 --> 26:55.775
We're both still a little
shaky on the rules.

26:55.777 --> 26:57.510
Got it.

26:57.512 --> 27:00.546
Look, I should probably
go talk to her.

27:00.548 --> 27:04.216
But I meant what I said before.

27:04.218 --> 27:06.051
I'd like to see you again.

27:06.053 --> 27:07.753
So...

27:07.755 --> 27:09.455
Let me know.

27:09.457 --> 27:11.357
Sure.

27:11.359 --> 27:12.825
Definitely.

27:17.898 --> 27:19.899
Sure, they're throwing me
a party now,

27:19.901 --> 27:22.167
but the ballet world is brutal.

27:22.169 --> 27:24.403
The girl I'm replacing
was out by 24,

27:24.405 --> 27:26.905
with busted knees
and a torn groin muscle...

27:26.907 --> 27:29.675
Oh, and anorexia.
So at least she was skinny.

27:29.677 --> 27:31.477
That's awful.

27:31.479 --> 27:33.178
You don't get many shots
at this.

27:33.180 --> 27:35.647
So when it comes,
you have to claw for it...

27:35.649 --> 27:37.983
Even if it destroys you.

27:37.985 --> 27:40.152
Or you have
to destroy someone else.

27:40.154 --> 27:42.588
If she hadn't busted her knee,
I wouldn't be here.

27:42.590 --> 27:45.257
You don't feel bad
about taking her place?

27:45.259 --> 27:47.559
By the time she left,
I think she was done.

27:47.561 --> 27:49.695
I mean, she didn't say that,

27:49.697 --> 27:52.898
but she started partying,
not caring as much.

27:54.334 --> 27:55.667
She was ready to go.

27:55.669 --> 27:58.904
I have a friend who seems
like he's doing the same thing.

27:58.906 --> 28:00.772
Then maybe it's time
for him to go.

28:00.774 --> 28:03.508
Look, I know it's harsh,

28:03.510 --> 28:05.877
but that's this world
and this city.

28:05.879 --> 28:08.213
It's kill or be killed.

28:08.215 --> 28:10.549
And I don't just want
to survive.

28:10.551 --> 28:12.250
I wanna thrive.

28:12.252 --> 28:14.719
That's very Darwinian.

28:14.721 --> 28:16.354
That's right.

28:16.356 --> 28:18.190
It's the most natural thing
in the world.

28:18.192 --> 28:19.658
So you can't feel bad about it.

28:19.660 --> 28:22.160
Amelia was right.

28:22.162 --> 28:23.562
To make it in this city,
you have to let

28:23.564 --> 28:25.530
your animal instincts
take over.

28:25.532 --> 28:26.765
And in that moment,

28:26.767 --> 28:28.833
I knew I was going
to write this piece

28:28.835 --> 28:30.168
and thrive.

28:30.170 --> 28:31.803
So you don't mind if I ask you
a couple more questions?

28:31.805 --> 28:33.138
Of course.

28:33.140 --> 28:35.140
And there's nothing you want me
to take off the record?

28:35.142 --> 28:36.941
Nah. This world
is so screwed up.

28:36.943 --> 28:38.343
Let people see it.

28:44.453 --> 28:46.253
Wow.

28:46.255 --> 28:48.022
You got her to reveal so much.

28:48.024 --> 28:50.391
Turns out we had a lot
in common.

28:50.393 --> 28:52.660
Well, I'm terribly glad
this ended up on your desk.

28:52.662 --> 28:55.396
I don't think anyone else
could have written this but you.

28:55.398 --> 28:57.098
- Well done.
- Thank you.

28:57.100 --> 29:00.301
And I also noticed a certain
linguistic similarity

29:00.303 --> 29:02.536
with Bennet's recent work.

29:02.538 --> 29:04.939
Well...

29:04.941 --> 29:07.474
- That's...
- Carrie, I'm not an idiot.

29:07.476 --> 29:10.077
I know you wrote the parachute
pants piece for him.

29:10.079 --> 29:12.780
I just... I really wanted
to help Bennet out.

29:12.782 --> 29:15.516
Stop worrying about Bennet.
Think about yourself.

29:15.518 --> 29:17.351
Because this piece
is going in the magazine

29:17.353 --> 29:18.852
under your name.

29:22.190 --> 29:24.491
Mouse!

29:24.493 --> 29:25.759
Have you seen Pete?

29:25.761 --> 29:27.127
Uh, no.

29:27.129 --> 29:28.629
I thoughouyou guys
were hanging out today.

29:28.631 --> 29:30.531
Well, we were supposed to.
And then this morning,

29:30.533 --> 29:31.698
he called while I was out

29:31.700 --> 29:33.433
and told me my mom
that he's leaving tonight.

29:33.435 --> 29:34.902
And now I can't
find him anywhere.

29:34.904 --> 29:37.471
Okay, don't panic. I'm sure
he'll show up sooner or later.

29:37.473 --> 29:38.906
Why'd I let you convince me

29:38.908 --> 29:40.274
to scare him off
with my onion breath

29:40.276 --> 29:41.775
and my hairy legs?

29:41.777 --> 29:43.343
We were just trying to help,

29:43.345 --> 29:44.511
so you wouldn't make
the same mistakes

29:44.513 --> 29:46.079
you kept making in the past.

29:46.081 --> 29:48.715
Great, well, now you helped me
right out of a boyfriend.

29:50.285 --> 29:52.486
It's not too late, you know,

29:52.488 --> 29:54.054
to make your own mistakes.

29:54.056 --> 29:55.255
How would I do that?

29:55.257 --> 29:56.890
Well, he took the bus
here, right?

29:56.892 --> 30:00.427
So go down to the bus station
and wait for him there.

30:00.429 --> 30:01.628
And tell him what?

30:01.630 --> 30:04.631
Whatever your instincts
tell you to say.

30:13.242 --> 30:16.142
Oh, God.
That's probably my dad.

30:22.951 --> 30:24.651
Hey, Bennet.

30:24.653 --> 30:27.187
- What's going on?
- I just got fired.

30:27.189 --> 30:28.822
Oh, my gosh, are you serious?

30:28.824 --> 30:30.457
Oh, don't act so shocked,
Carrie.

30:30.459 --> 30:32.058
All the times I've watched
"All About Eve,"

30:32.060 --> 30:34.160
and I didn't even realize
you were "All About Eve-ing" me.

30:34.162 --> 30:35.595
What are you talking about?

30:35.597 --> 30:37.664
Me? I didn't want
to get you fired.

30:37.666 --> 30:40.633
I mean, I've been working
my butt off to save your job.

30:40.635 --> 30:43.803
Yeah? Well, nice work...
Taking my assignment and all.

30:43.805 --> 30:46.306
Bennet, you vanished.
I couldn't reach you.

30:46.308 --> 30:48.608
And apparently,
you were out partying.

30:48.610 --> 30:49.976
So what was I supposed to do?

30:49.978 --> 30:52.445
Not stab me in the back.

30:52.447 --> 30:54.314
Thanks for being
such a good friend.

31:02.557 --> 31:04.657
I didn't mean to get him fired.

31:09.530 --> 31:10.897
Oh.

31:10.899 --> 31:13.166
- Who are you?
- I'm Dorrit...

31:13.168 --> 31:16.302
Bradshaw. I'm just waiting
to meet my dad.

31:16.304 --> 31:18.838
Oh, I didn't realize
Tom had kids.

31:18.840 --> 31:20.673
Yep, me and my sister.

31:20.675 --> 31:22.642
Don't worry.
I won't be long.

31:22.644 --> 31:24.477
I just need some money.

31:24.479 --> 31:26.479
Got it.

31:26.481 --> 31:28.114
Don't tell him,

31:28.116 --> 31:30.049
but he's super easy
to manipulate.

31:30.051 --> 31:32.351
A couple tears,
and he'll give me

31:32.353 --> 31:34.153
pretty much whatever I ask for.

31:34.155 --> 31:35.921
There's nothing men
are more afraid of

31:35.923 --> 31:37.356
than a crying woman.

31:37.358 --> 31:41.293
Or a woman who seems
disorganized and overwhelmed.

31:41.295 --> 31:43.629
I feel sorta bad for him,
actually.

31:43.631 --> 31:45.998
It's so easy to get
what you want from him.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.033
Don't feel bad.

31:48.035 --> 31:49.635
Women have it tough
out there, trust me.

31:51.439 --> 31:53.405
Most men underestimate you.

31:53.407 --> 31:56.342
But it sounds like
you are working that

31:56.344 --> 31:58.611
to your advantage already.

31:59.779 --> 32:03.449
Does "P & L" stand for
profit and loss statements?

32:03.451 --> 32:05.251
Uh... yeah.

32:05.253 --> 32:09.388
Good. Then I have
the right one.

32:09.390 --> 32:10.923
What are you doing?

32:10.925 --> 32:13.392
Giving this file to my dad.

32:13.394 --> 32:15.561
It's funny.
You know what I've noticed?

32:15.563 --> 32:18.097
Some women underestimate
other women, too...

32:18.099 --> 32:20.699
Just because they're young.

32:21.801 --> 32:24.470
- Bye, daddy.
- Bye, sweetie. See you at home.

32:28.609 --> 32:29.975
Feelin' like a sucker?

32:31.110 --> 32:32.778
Yeah, I know the feeling.

32:32.780 --> 32:34.313
Well, that was a cheap trick...

32:34.315 --> 32:35.514
using your daughter like that.

32:35.516 --> 32:37.015
Oh, there's a lot
of cheap tricks

32:37.017 --> 32:38.283
being played in this room.

32:38.285 --> 32:40.986
Now, the way I see it,
I can either go through these

32:40.988 --> 32:42.854
and find all
of your clients' weak spots,

32:42.856 --> 32:45.891
or... we can call it a draw
and start over.

32:45.893 --> 32:47.426
Negotiate the rest
of the deal...

32:47.428 --> 32:50.128
Mano a mano...
like real lawyers.

32:50.130 --> 32:51.663
No cheating.

32:53.966 --> 32:56.468
Fine. You're on.

32:56.470 --> 32:59.438
May the best lawyer win.

32:59.440 --> 33:01.173
I still can't believe
he got fired.

33:01.175 --> 33:03.675
I mean, the whole time
I was covering for him,

33:03.677 --> 33:06.678
I never thought Larissa
would actually... do it.

33:09.048 --> 33:10.115
What is it you're not saying?

33:10.117 --> 33:13.018
Why can't
you just admit it?

33:13.020 --> 33:14.319
Admit what?

33:14.321 --> 33:16.588
You knew Bennet
was on shaky ground.

33:16.590 --> 33:17.789
What'd you think
was gonna happen

33:17.791 --> 33:18.757
when you took his story?

33:18.759 --> 33:20.959
That she'd yell at him
or something?

33:20.961 --> 33:23.328
And I'm sorry, but Bennet
was never actually

33:23.330 --> 33:25.130
going to that party,

33:25.132 --> 33:26.664
which means he would
have been fired anyway.

33:26.666 --> 33:29.000
I just seized an opportunity.

33:29.002 --> 33:30.035
Anyone would have.

33:30.037 --> 33:32.337
No. A lot of people
wouldn't.

33:32.339 --> 33:33.638
I wouldn't.

33:33.640 --> 33:35.106
Come on, Carrie.
Admit it.

33:35.108 --> 33:37.008
You went for the jugular.

33:37.010 --> 33:38.743
You wanted something so bad,
you didn't care

33:38.745 --> 33:40.612
someone else might
get hurt in the process.

33:40.614 --> 33:42.580
It's not that simple.

33:42.582 --> 33:44.916
I didn't mean for Bennet
to get hurt.

33:44.918 --> 33:46.618
But he did.

33:46.620 --> 33:48.219
I don't expect you
to understand.

33:48.221 --> 33:50.555
You never had to claw your way
to get something.

33:50.557 --> 33:52.824
But if I'm going
to be a writer,

33:52.826 --> 33:54.325
I'm gonna have
to work my butt off

33:54.327 --> 33:57.061
- and fight for it.
- Oh, come on.

33:57.063 --> 33:59.397
It's not like you're some
poor, struggling artist.

33:59.399 --> 34:01.199
You're an intern at a magazine

34:01.201 --> 34:02.700
who lives with her father
and doesn't have to worry

34:02.702 --> 34:04.802
about money or a roof
over her head.

34:04.804 --> 34:07.672
First off, I'm on my own
after college,

34:07.674 --> 34:09.507
which is why I work so hard,

34:09.509 --> 34:12.009
and why I take opportunities
when they come my way.

34:12.011 --> 34:13.878
Not all of us get to live
off a trust fund

34:13.880 --> 34:15.513
for the rest of our lives.

34:16.949 --> 34:19.050
I'm not gonna be able
to do that either.

34:19.052 --> 34:20.484
Of course you are.

34:20.485 --> 34:22.820
No. My dad told me earlier.

34:22.822 --> 34:24.455
He lost everything.

34:24.456 --> 34:26.324
So I'm giving him
my trust fund.

34:40.029 --> 34:42.496
Why didn't you tell me
this was going on?

34:42.498 --> 34:44.399
Because I was embarrassed.

34:44.400 --> 34:46.501
You're right. I've never had
to worry about money.

34:46.503 --> 34:48.168
I feel stupid
even complaining about it.

34:48.170 --> 34:50.505
I mean, other people
have real problems.

34:50.507 --> 34:52.574
Sebastian, this is real.

34:52.576 --> 34:55.744
And you shouldn't feel bad
talking about it.

34:55.746 --> 34:59.781
Are you sure you want
to give your trust fund to him?

34:59.783 --> 35:03.785
I don't think
I can abandon him.

35:03.787 --> 35:06.721
I guess I just don't have
that killer instinct.

35:06.723 --> 35:09.791
Aren't you worried
he's gonna lose the money?

35:09.793 --> 35:11.659
Yes.

35:11.661 --> 35:13.861
But you're still
gonna give it to him?

35:13.863 --> 35:16.831
Well, I already invested
$25,000 in the company.

35:16.833 --> 35:18.833
Too late to get that back.
But...

35:18.835 --> 35:21.169
Yeah, I'll give the rest
to him.

35:21.171 --> 35:22.403
I mean, it's his money anyway.

35:22.405 --> 35:23.438
He made it.

35:23.440 --> 35:25.573
What will you do?

35:25.575 --> 35:26.741
Will you have to move out?

35:26.743 --> 35:28.876
I don't know.

35:28.878 --> 35:30.678
I mean, this place
is rent-controlled.

35:30.680 --> 35:31.813
If I sell my Porsche,

35:31.815 --> 35:35.049
that'll buy me at least
six months.

35:35.051 --> 35:38.553
Maybe by then, my investment
will start to pay off.

35:40.022 --> 35:43.324
I guess it's pretty scary, huh?

35:43.326 --> 35:46.794
I'm so sorry, Sebastian.

35:56.004 --> 35:58.005
Pete?

35:58.007 --> 35:59.807
Pete!

35:59.809 --> 36:01.475
- Hi.
- Maggie.

36:01.477 --> 36:04.311
You seriously didn't
have to come see me off.

36:04.313 --> 36:06.781
- No, I did.
- No, you didn't.

36:06.783 --> 36:07.948
I've got pretty good instincts

36:07.950 --> 36:09.150
when it comes to breakups.

36:09.152 --> 36:11.786
They teach us situational
awareness in boot camp.

36:11.788 --> 36:13.821
You were sending
some very clear signals.

36:13.823 --> 36:15.389
No! No, I wasn't
sending clear signals.

36:15.391 --> 36:16.357
That's the thing.

36:16.359 --> 36:18.192
Uh, you barely
dressed up to see me,

36:18.194 --> 36:21.028
wouldn't even kiss me,
and that diner...

36:21.030 --> 36:23.631
- Kind of the opposite of romantic.
- I know.

36:23.633 --> 36:25.332
I know. I...

36:25.334 --> 36:27.334
I've been trying really hard

36:27.336 --> 36:29.236
to keep you at bay
so I wouldn't screw this up

36:29.238 --> 36:31.005
like I have
my other relationships.

36:31.007 --> 36:32.539
What are you talking about?

36:32.541 --> 36:35.876
It's just...

36:35.878 --> 36:38.679
I've made a lot
of mistakes in the past.

36:38.681 --> 36:39.947
And I don't want
to repeat them.

36:39.949 --> 36:41.215
So I'm just gonna be
honest with you

36:41.217 --> 36:42.649
and hope that you don't
want to break up with me

36:42.651 --> 36:43.650
after I say all this.

36:43.652 --> 36:48.122
The fact is,
I sleep with people

36:48.124 --> 36:49.089
way too soon...

36:49.091 --> 36:51.124
Or people who are just
wrong for me

36:51.126 --> 36:52.759
and think it's love.

36:52.761 --> 36:55.362
Because I totally confuse
sex with love,

36:55.364 --> 36:57.231
and then I get my heart broken

36:57.233 --> 36:59.433
or make huge mistakes.

36:59.435 --> 37:00.901
And I really like you.

37:00.903 --> 37:03.971
And I just couldn't handle it
going down like that again.

37:03.973 --> 37:05.339
You really like me?

37:05.341 --> 37:08.275
I'm crazy about you.

37:08.277 --> 37:11.411
Well, I like hearing that...

37:11.413 --> 37:12.779
because I love you.

37:12.781 --> 37:14.915
What?

37:14.917 --> 37:18.251
But we never even...

37:18.253 --> 37:20.420
You know. But we've talked
on the phone every night

37:20.422 --> 37:23.290
for, like, a month,
and I love talking to you.

37:23.292 --> 37:24.791
I love hearing
what you have to say

37:24.793 --> 37:26.626
about everything.

37:26.628 --> 37:28.828
And I don't want
to rush the other stuff

37:28.830 --> 37:30.630
if it means
you're gonna freak out.

37:30.632 --> 37:32.966
Because I want this
to be something.

37:34.035 --> 37:36.236
So I'm fine with waiting, okay?

37:37.738 --> 37:39.072
Just, no more
chili cheese fries.

37:39.074 --> 37:41.841
- They smell disgusting.
 - Deal.

37:46.680 --> 37:48.982
They say that the hallmark
of a good negotiation

37:48.984 --> 37:51.684
is when neither side
is particularly happy.

37:51.686 --> 37:54.020
Well, then this was
a very good negotiation.

37:54.022 --> 37:55.755
My people will hate this deal.

37:55.757 --> 37:58.658
Yep. Mine, too.

37:58.660 --> 38:00.326
You didn't need to pull
that whole "helpless" act

38:00.328 --> 38:01.427
on me, you know?

38:01.429 --> 38:03.830
Sure, you say that now.

38:03.832 --> 38:06.399
Seriously. I mean,
you're a killer negotiator.

38:06.401 --> 38:07.901
You don't need tricks.
You've got skills.

38:07.903 --> 38:11.437
Hmm. You're not
too bad yourself.

38:11.439 --> 38:14.073
Oh, a word of advice, though...

38:14.075 --> 38:16.743
- I'd keep an eye on that daughter of yours.
- Are you kidding?

38:16.745 --> 38:18.478
I've completely given up
on that one.

38:20.648 --> 38:24.283
You know, I'm almost sad
this negotiation is over.

38:24.285 --> 38:25.885
Why?

38:25.887 --> 38:29.355
I was just starting
to enjoy your company.

38:30.557 --> 38:32.592
Same here.

38:34.194 --> 38:36.896
What do you say
you and I bill our clients

38:36.898 --> 38:38.431
for another two hours?

38:38.433 --> 38:40.967
Let's make it three.

38:53.381 --> 38:55.314
Oh, hi.

38:55.316 --> 38:56.716
What are you doing here?

38:56.718 --> 38:58.417
Looking for you.

38:58.419 --> 39:00.186
Uh, I followed the flyers.

39:00.188 --> 39:02.521
Well... you found me.

39:02.523 --> 39:04.824
So unless you're gonna
help look for Gabriel,

39:04.826 --> 39:06.025
I'm kind of busy.

39:06.027 --> 39:07.560
Well, you know...
You know, I was serious

39:07.562 --> 39:09.562
the other night.
I mean...

39:09.564 --> 39:11.463
I'd love to see you again.

39:12.666 --> 39:14.033
If you're interested.

39:14.035 --> 39:16.936
I am interested.

39:18.004 --> 39:19.805
But that's the problem.

39:19.807 --> 39:21.407
I don't understand.

39:21.409 --> 39:22.875
How... how is that
a problem?

39:22.877 --> 39:26.545
Look, first off...

39:26.547 --> 39:28.347
It feels a little like
you and your wife

39:28.349 --> 39:30.582
haven't totally worked out
the open marriage thing.

39:30.584 --> 39:33.986
So that's a little more
complicated than I'd like.

39:33.988 --> 39:37.723
And second...
if I have to be honest,

39:37.725 --> 39:38.924
I like you.

39:38.926 --> 39:40.793
Which means...

39:40.795 --> 39:42.694
I don't want to share you
with anyone.

39:42.696 --> 39:44.696
Oh.

39:44.698 --> 39:46.532
I'm sorry, Elliot.

39:47.834 --> 39:49.868
This is really weird for me.

39:49.870 --> 39:51.470
I'm used to having sex
with whoever I want

39:51.472 --> 39:53.005
whenever I want,

39:53.007 --> 39:56.174
not settling down with one guy.

39:56.176 --> 39:57.743
But sometimes
your instincts change,

39:57.745 --> 40:00.178
and you just have
to go with it.

40:13.227 --> 40:17.496
Oh, my God. Gabriel?!

40:22.336 --> 40:24.769
New York has a way
of changing you...

40:24.771 --> 40:26.171
Sometimes in ways
you don't expect.

40:58.572 --> 41:00.872
No. That's okay.

41:00.874 --> 41:01.873
Oh.

41:01.875 --> 41:04.809
And as our instincts change,

41:04.811 --> 41:06.110
so do our actions.

41:06.112 --> 41:08.613
And sometimes the city
simply brings out

41:08.615 --> 41:10.381
what's already inside of you...

41:10.383 --> 41:12.083
A killer instinct...

41:12.085 --> 41:13.351
which may be scary,

41:13.353 --> 41:15.787
or may just be about survival.

41:15.789 --> 41:18.956
But sometimes it's hard
to tell the difference.
