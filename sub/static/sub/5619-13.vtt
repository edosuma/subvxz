00:02.420 --> 00:04.798
<i>Previously on Marvel's</i>
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.923 --> 00:06.549
You're here for Bobbi.

00:06.633 --> 00:08.635
She's the only reason
why you call yourself an agent.

00:08.760 --> 00:09.886
Well, that's no way to treat a friend.

00:09.969 --> 00:11.012
We're not friends.

00:11.096 --> 00:12.847
Malick is supposed to be
the last head of HYDRA,

00:12.931 --> 00:14.391
but I can't shake this feeling

00:14.474 --> 00:15.809
that he's reporting to someone else.

00:15.934 --> 00:18.520
And our guest needs Inhumans.
I'm building an army.

00:18.603 --> 00:22.565
Gideon Malick has a stake
in almost every country's economy.

00:22.649 --> 00:25.944
He's spent a lifetime
and a fortune building influence.

00:26.069 --> 00:28.571
Uh, these Inhumans
are not our enemies.

00:28.780 --> 00:32.409
My country is prepared
to establish a home for them,

00:32.491 --> 00:33.827
a sanctuary state.

00:33.952 --> 00:35.662
<i>There are a few obstacles,</i>

00:35.787 --> 00:37.497
but with your influence,

00:37.580 --> 00:39.499
we should be able to work them all out.

00:39.582 --> 00:42.502
<i>Hunter, Bobbi,
are you there? Come in. Over.</i>

00:42.585 --> 00:44.212
Sorry. Can't talk right now, boss.

00:44.295 --> 00:47.132
We're in the belly of the beast.
We'll call you when we land.

01:04.190 --> 01:07.694
How you are alive, sitting here,
is a miracle to me.

01:10.363 --> 01:13.450
You're lucky
that your government intervened,

01:13.825 --> 01:16.661
that Interpol was brought in at all.

01:16.745 --> 01:19.664
For something as serious as this?

01:21.124 --> 01:24.836
Three highly decorated members
of the Russian government,

01:24.919 --> 01:26.796
murdered in cold blood,

01:27.255 --> 01:28.715
on Russian soil,

01:28.798 --> 01:32.260
by former S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.

01:34.679 --> 01:37.849
In another time, we would have
found you three feet below the ice,

01:37.932 --> 01:40.018
if we found you at all.

01:41.186 --> 01:44.731
You must have something
to say for yourself.

01:48.026 --> 01:50.361
I'd like a cheeseburger, medium,

01:50.445 --> 01:55.158
with cheddar cheese, ketchup, mayo,
lettuce, and tomato.

01:55.241 --> 01:58.328
And some curly fries. Crispy.

02:00.497 --> 02:01.873
Ms Morse,

02:04.167 --> 02:06.002
I'm your only ally here.

02:06.878 --> 02:09.798
There's no one else to help you,
nowhere to run.

02:09.881 --> 02:11.299
So tell me,

02:12.759 --> 02:15.428
what were you doing in Siberia?

02:28.399 --> 02:29.692
Malick's convoy heading our way.

02:29.776 --> 02:32.237
I really should stretch before running.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.030
Wait, where's the...

02:34.572 --> 02:35.949
I thought I had it.

02:36.032 --> 02:38.576
Being cooped up in a jet
isn't exactly conducive to blood flow.

02:38.660 --> 02:40.078
Where's the target designator?

02:41.037 --> 02:43.456
Here. I got it. Here you go, love.

02:46.668 --> 02:48.670
Bird to Zephyr, painting target.
Do you copy?

02:50.171 --> 02:51.673
<i>Copy that, Bird.</i>

02:51.756 --> 02:53.049
Target's lit. We're tracking now.

02:57.011 --> 02:58.721
Okay, it looks like
Malick's convoy's heading

02:58.805 --> 03:00.056
for this decommissioned power plant

03:00.139 --> 03:01.432
about 30 kilometres away.

03:01.516 --> 03:03.518
Dead in the middle
of Nowhereville, Siberia.

03:03.601 --> 03:06.646
Yeah, if Malick and his Russian patsy
want to build some Inhuman sanctuary,

03:06.729 --> 03:08.606
why not build it
someplace nice and sunny?

03:08.690 --> 03:10.692
Same reason they don't put
a prison camp in Malibu.

03:11.067 --> 03:12.569
"Not in my backyard."

03:13.194 --> 03:15.405
That's what the sanctuary
really is gonna be, isn't it?

03:15.488 --> 03:16.531
A prison camp.

03:16.614 --> 03:18.658
We'll see what Bobbi and Hunter find
when they get there.

03:18.741 --> 03:19.784
Zephyr to Bird,

03:19.868 --> 03:21.703
we have Malick's convoy,
I can guide you to them,

03:21.786 --> 03:23.955
but you're gonna need some transport.
Will that be a problem?

03:27.292 --> 03:28.585
No, I think we're good.

03:28.668 --> 03:30.003
Chop-chop.

03:35.258 --> 03:38.595
I have to say, I have never
encountered someone like you.

03:38.678 --> 03:39.846
Oh, why, thank you.

03:39.929 --> 03:43.516
Someone who has the ability
to spout absolute nonsense

03:43.600 --> 03:44.934
with such ease.

03:45.018 --> 03:48.271
It's not nonsense. It's the truth.

03:48.354 --> 03:50.607
Bobbi and I were on holiday,
picking mushrooms...

03:50.690 --> 03:52.609
In the woods of Siberia
in the dead of winter.

03:52.692 --> 03:55.486
Do you know a better place
to find the jumbo chaga mushroom?

03:55.570 --> 03:57.030
Because I certainly do not.

03:57.113 --> 03:59.115
You were caught with a weapon,
standing over a dead man.

03:59.198 --> 04:01.367
An unfortunate circumstance.

04:01.451 --> 04:02.702
Who ordered the assassination?

04:02.785 --> 04:04.495
Assassination? Are you joking?

04:04.579 --> 04:07.373
You broke into
a top-secret Russian facility.

04:07.457 --> 04:10.919
We were accosted in the woods
by some ham-fisted,

04:11.002 --> 04:15.298
dare I say, drunken soldiers,
who dragged us into this entire mess.

04:15.548 --> 04:19.344
All we did was try to get out of it.
We're the victims here, mate.

04:22.889 --> 04:26.476
You want to know the key
to a good mushroom soup?

04:26.559 --> 04:28.144
Dried porcinis.

04:32.857 --> 04:35.026
Quite pretty, in its own way.

04:41.532 --> 04:43.576
Zephyr, we're in sight,
but no visuals on the target.

04:43.701 --> 04:44.994
- Can we get thermals?
<i>- Yep.</i>

04:45.078 --> 04:47.372
We've got eyes on you, Bird,
but we can't see inside the plant.

04:47.497 --> 04:51.376
Internal lining must be blocking thermal
or ground-penetrating radar.

04:53.419 --> 04:54.796
They're hiding something.

04:54.879 --> 04:56.881
Malick's SUV is inside,

04:57.006 --> 05:01.010
parked in the loading-bay area,
along with several military vehicles.

05:01.719 --> 05:04.931
Must be their base of operations
during construction.

05:05.056 --> 05:07.517
They've wiped out
almost 30 square kilometres of forest

05:07.600 --> 05:09.060
just to make room for this place.

05:09.769 --> 05:11.062
You wonder why the planet's dying.

05:11.187 --> 05:12.438
You got that right, mate.

05:12.563 --> 05:14.107
You and Jemma
watch that documentary I mentioned?

05:14.232 --> 05:15.650
Oh, yes! The one about the Amazon?

05:15.733 --> 05:17.402
- It...
- And you'll talk about it later.

05:17.527 --> 05:18.945
We need eyes and ears down there.

05:19.070 --> 05:22.407
Malick told me point-blank
he's putting together an Inhuman army,

05:22.532 --> 05:24.200
so he's either here to add more soldiers

05:24.283 --> 05:25.368
<i>or to set up shop.</i>

05:25.451 --> 05:28.413
Copy that. If we're gonna infiltrate,
a surveillance package would help, sir.

05:28.538 --> 05:30.498
And guns. Don't forget those.

05:30.581 --> 05:32.834
I'll send a backup team your way.

05:32.917 --> 05:35.044
If we can get to Malick,
have we got the green light?

05:35.795 --> 05:38.923
You want to assassinate
a former member of the World Council

05:39.048 --> 05:40.299
on Russian soil,

05:40.425 --> 05:41.801
<i>knowing that if we get caught</i>

05:41.926 --> 05:43.761
<i>or our actions
are tied to the US government</i>

05:43.886 --> 05:46.597
in any way, that it'll be considered
an act of war?

05:46.723 --> 05:48.933
So, you're saying?

05:49.058 --> 05:50.560
Pretty sure that's gonna be a no.

05:50.643 --> 05:51.853
It's a big no.

05:51.936 --> 05:53.771
Find out what Malick's up to
and get back to me.

05:53.896 --> 05:55.690
- And keep a low profile.
<i>- Copy.</i>

05:55.773 --> 05:57.275
Over and out.

06:12.123 --> 06:13.166
Hi.

06:13.291 --> 06:14.292
Hi.

06:17.170 --> 06:19.047
Kind of nice, isn't it?

06:19.130 --> 06:21.883
The two of us, alone,

06:21.966 --> 06:23.760
in the woods.

06:23.843 --> 06:26.054
No. Not here, not now.

06:26.137 --> 06:28.347
Though, I love the way you think.

06:28.473 --> 06:31.434
Get your mind out of the gutter, woman.

06:31.517 --> 06:33.144
I was just trying to recall the last time

06:33.269 --> 06:35.897
we went away together
on a proper vacation.

06:35.980 --> 06:37.648
Well, let's see.

06:39.108 --> 06:40.610
Rio, Caesar Park Hotel.

06:40.693 --> 06:42.695
On a mission. Stakeout.

06:42.945 --> 06:43.988
San Diego.

06:44.113 --> 06:45.490
Visiting your mum doesn't count.

06:47.158 --> 06:48.159
Florence?

06:48.284 --> 06:49.660
That wasn't me.

06:52.371 --> 06:55.166
The word you're looking for is "never."

06:55.666 --> 06:58.169
No, not never. You're exaggerating.

07:00.004 --> 07:02.465
Fine. I'm exaggerating.

07:07.637 --> 07:08.846
This is the job.

07:08.971 --> 07:11.641
We have to make certain sacrifices,
like free time.

07:11.724 --> 07:12.934
Where do you draw the line?

07:13.017 --> 07:16.187
The sacrifices we've made,
the compromises we've made.

07:16.687 --> 07:18.773
Where's this coming from?

07:18.856 --> 07:22.276
Carl Creel killed two of our friends,
and we go on a mission with him.

07:22.360 --> 07:23.653
To be fair, Talbot brought him in.

07:23.736 --> 07:25.571
And Coulson approved it.

07:25.696 --> 07:27.615
Like when we made peace
with Ward, last year,

07:27.698 --> 07:28.908
to go on a mission,
and he almost killed you.

07:29.033 --> 07:30.034
Ward's dead.

07:30.159 --> 07:32.829
And here we are, chasing a man
who may be the last head of HYDRA,

07:32.912 --> 07:34.872
and our orders are to surveil him?

07:35.206 --> 07:36.457
Why?

07:36.541 --> 07:38.459
So he can come back to haunt us later?

07:38.543 --> 07:41.671
There's a pattern emerging,
and it always ends badly.

07:44.173 --> 07:46.300
Oh, forget it. I just need a break.

07:48.302 --> 07:50.888
Are you talking about a vacation
or something else?

07:50.972 --> 07:52.140
Hold on.

07:54.016 --> 07:55.810
We've got movement.

07:58.563 --> 08:00.314
What's that tech
wrapped around his head?

08:00.731 --> 08:02.024
It's got to be an Inhuman.

08:02.859 --> 08:03.901
They're holding him prisoner.

08:03.985 --> 08:05.236
Coulson needs to see this.

08:08.573 --> 08:10.575
Well, that's one way
to infiltrate the premises.

08:20.001 --> 08:21.085
Please, don't shoot.

08:21.169 --> 08:22.753
Oh, my gosh. We are so sorry.

08:22.837 --> 08:24.589
We were just looking for the main road.

08:24.672 --> 08:27.091
Out for a spot of mushroom picking.

08:27.175 --> 08:28.259
You see?

08:30.428 --> 08:31.679
Mushrooms?

08:31.762 --> 08:34.515
My... My phone battery died,
and we got lost.

08:34.599 --> 08:36.267
Do you guys have a map?

09:02.877 --> 09:04.045
He was just doing his job.

09:04.587 --> 09:05.713
So was Stalin.

09:09.550 --> 09:10.718
What'd he say?

09:24.899 --> 09:26.484
Where'd you get the hardware?

09:26.567 --> 09:29.111
We ran into some company.
Left them tied up in the forest.

09:30.321 --> 09:31.489
Um, are those mushrooms?

09:31.614 --> 09:32.657
Mmm-hmm.

09:33.950 --> 09:34.992
For soup.

09:36.494 --> 09:38.162
It's not bad, actually.

09:38.287 --> 09:39.747
Picked up some chatter on the radio.

09:39.830 --> 09:41.666
Malick and the man he brought
with him, Petrov,

09:41.791 --> 09:44.919
are gonna have some kind of powwow
with a few Russian Cabinet Ministers.

09:45.002 --> 09:47.338
Cabinet Ministers? Here?

09:47.421 --> 09:49.173
We think they're here
for the same reason as Malick.

09:49.298 --> 09:51.175
To get their eyes on an Inhuman.

09:51.300 --> 09:52.760
Do you think
they already have somebody?

09:52.843 --> 09:55.096
We saw a man being carted off
inside the compound,

09:55.179 --> 09:56.931
restrained by advanced biotech.

09:57.014 --> 09:59.267
Well, I thought the sanctuary
hasn't even started construction yet.

09:59.350 --> 10:01.519
We need to get inside,
get surveillance up and running.

10:01.852 --> 10:02.937
How's everyone's Russian?

10:03.020 --> 10:04.605
My pronunciation's not fluent.

10:04.689 --> 10:05.940
And mine's nonexistent.

10:06.023 --> 10:07.108
I dated a Russian hacker once,

10:07.191 --> 10:09.110
but I only learned the dirty words.

10:09.193 --> 10:10.945
Guys, seriously, we're spies.

10:11.028 --> 10:12.613
I thought we all learned languages.

10:12.697 --> 10:14.365
Well, for the record,
Lincoln's at the Cocoon right now,

10:14.490 --> 10:15.616
studying all sorts of stuff.

10:15.700 --> 10:17.618
Russian is not one of them.

10:17.702 --> 10:18.869
Sorry.

10:18.995 --> 10:21.497
Think this one's all on you,
Rosetta Stone.

10:22.123 --> 10:24.041
But we'll be in the wings,
armed and ready.

10:24.375 --> 10:25.543
Hey, at least you look the part, dear.

10:26.711 --> 10:27.878
He's not wrong.

10:28.004 --> 10:32.216
Bobbi, you're with Daisy and Mack.
Find the security hub and locate Malick.

10:32.300 --> 10:34.468
So that means I stay here alone?

10:35.511 --> 10:36.887
You're with me.

10:38.222 --> 10:39.890
Remember our mission protocol.

10:39.974 --> 10:42.310
Low profile, in and out,
no one gets caught.

10:51.193 --> 10:53.654
Okay. I'm going to ask you
some very basic questions

10:53.738 --> 10:54.822
to establish a baseline.

10:54.905 --> 10:56.073
Of course.

10:56.157 --> 10:57.742
State your full name for the record.

10:58.492 --> 11:00.703
Amadeus Ravenclaw Hunter.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.000
How long were you married?

11:06.083 --> 11:07.168
Which time?

11:07.251 --> 11:09.879
Is it true you were with the British SAS?

11:10.755 --> 11:13.507
You start with four ounces
of dried porcini mushrooms.

11:13.591 --> 11:16.010
We have your records.
We know you are agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

11:16.093 --> 11:17.595
Yes, and S.H.I.E.L.D. was dismantled.

11:17.678 --> 11:19.513
Your father was a police officer in Kent.

11:19.597 --> 11:21.932
One cup of pearl barley,
two cups sour cream...

11:22.016 --> 11:23.017
Why did you go to Siberia?

11:23.100 --> 11:24.185
We were on vacation.

11:24.268 --> 11:26.103
You really want to know my secret?

11:30.274 --> 11:32.276
Chicken bouillon.

11:34.528 --> 11:37.281
Stall all you want.
I will get answers.

11:39.950 --> 11:41.202
When did you divorce Mr Hunter?

11:41.285 --> 11:42.787
We know you're lying
about the soldiers.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.747
We have three bodies
that someone must answer for.

11:45.623 --> 11:47.458
How did you and Ms Morse get here?

11:47.541 --> 11:48.709
There are no records of you
flying into Russia.

11:48.793 --> 11:50.044
<i>Where were you when
S.H.I.E.L.D. fell?</i>

11:50.127 --> 11:52.463
<i>If you are tourists,
where are you staying? What hotel?</i>

11:52.588 --> 11:54.465
<i>Multiple witnesses
saw you pull the trigger.</i>

11:54.548 --> 11:56.050
<i>Do you deny this?</i>

11:59.804 --> 12:01.597
Your first victim.

12:02.473 --> 12:03.891
Why did you kill him?

12:04.475 --> 12:05.601
I didn't.

12:10.815 --> 12:11.899
So,

12:13.609 --> 12:15.736
you're saying it was your ex-husband
who did this?

12:16.487 --> 12:18.322
- No, that's not what I...
- Excellent.

12:18.406 --> 12:21.075
Finally, a confession.
A very wise choice, Ms Morse.

12:21.158 --> 12:22.576
You know that was not a confession.

12:22.660 --> 12:26.080
Mr Hunter can now be handed over
to the Russians for trial,

12:26.163 --> 12:27.832
which will likely result in his execution.

12:27.915 --> 12:28.916
You cannot do that!

12:28.999 --> 12:30.501
Oh, I can, and I will.

12:30.584 --> 12:32.670
You give me no other choice.

12:33.170 --> 12:35.506
All this time,
I was searching for your weakness,

12:35.631 --> 12:37.258
when it's obvious.

12:38.175 --> 12:39.510
Your weakness is each other.

12:41.804 --> 12:42.847
It's a lie!

12:42.972 --> 12:45.015
I've never seen that man before
in my life!

12:45.099 --> 12:46.183
You can't do this!

12:46.308 --> 12:48.602
Get off me! It's a lie!

12:48.686 --> 12:51.355
Where's Bobbi? Let me speak to Bobbi!

12:51.480 --> 12:53.107
Let me speak to Bobbi!

12:53.190 --> 12:55.693
Bob, don't tell them anything!

13:04.368 --> 13:06.954
They had the Inhuman on a gurney,
went through those doors.

13:08.831 --> 13:09.957
Patrol coming.

13:14.879 --> 13:16.797
We could just take them out.

13:16.881 --> 13:19.467
What part of "low profile"
don't you understand?

13:19.550 --> 13:22.219
It's bad enough that we have
four missing soldiers out in the woods.

13:29.518 --> 13:30.728
Go, go.

13:40.070 --> 13:41.906
Looks like someone else
got here first.

13:42.031 --> 13:44.867
- The Inhuman you saw?
- I don't think so.

13:53.042 --> 13:55.085
- This could be a problem.
- What, you know him?

13:55.252 --> 13:56.754
Yuri Krupin.

13:56.837 --> 13:59.340
He's the Russian Prime Minister's
personal attaché.

13:59.423 --> 14:01.842
What are the chances
he just tripped and fell

14:01.926 --> 14:04.094
and wrapped himself
in a nice, comfy tarp?

14:04.178 --> 14:07.097
We need to get this
to Coulson and Simmons.

14:11.936 --> 14:13.187
You're killing me, Mack.

14:13.270 --> 14:14.855
I'm not siding with Hunter.

14:14.939 --> 14:18.025
I'm just saying, I don't ever remember
you two taking a real vacation.

14:18.108 --> 14:19.109
What?

14:19.235 --> 14:20.361
Not even a honeymoon?

14:20.444 --> 14:23.072
I was in the middle of a mission.
I had to get back to Johannesburg.

14:23.906 --> 14:24.949
Can you cover our tracks?

14:25.074 --> 14:26.742
Yeah, sure, no problem.

14:27.409 --> 14:28.452
Oh.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.538
Hello, there.

14:31.288 --> 14:32.623
What's wrong, Tremors?

14:32.748 --> 14:34.792
Well, aside from the fact
that this thing is ancient,

14:34.875 --> 14:35.876
I do not read Cyrillic.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.628
- Yet.
- Forever the optimist.

14:37.753 --> 14:39.880
Come on, Daisy. You can hack
the Pentagon and shake the Earth.

14:39.964 --> 14:41.966
You're gonna let a few
backwards letters trip you up?

14:42.049 --> 14:43.133
Found Malick and Petrov.

14:43.968 --> 14:45.302
I'll get eyes and ears on them.

14:45.427 --> 14:49.056
Okay, we'll run back-end from here,
pipe it up to the Zephyr.

14:49.139 --> 14:50.474
Be careful.

14:51.267 --> 14:52.977
Wait, wait, hold on.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.395
The letter that looks
like New Hampshire with legs,

14:54.478 --> 14:55.604
that's "D," right?

14:55.980 --> 14:56.981
<i>Da.</i>

14:57.648 --> 14:58.899
Great.

15:02.653 --> 15:07.324
Just think what the United States did
for the Native American populations.

15:07.449 --> 15:11.745
If we hadn't created the reservations,
they would've been wiped out entirely.

15:11.829 --> 15:15.666
Yes, and this is exactly what we wish
to propose to the Kremlin.

15:15.749 --> 15:19.086
A kind of reservation for Inhumans.

15:20.337 --> 15:21.839
Uh, let us gather, please.

15:23.424 --> 15:25.801
Mr Malick, Gideon,

15:26.427 --> 15:28.762
on behalf
of the Minister of Internal Affairs

15:28.846 --> 15:31.098
and the Minister
of Emergency Situations,

15:31.181 --> 15:33.350
we all welcome you.

15:33.434 --> 15:35.102
We're up, sir.

15:35.185 --> 15:38.689
<i>And we would be very grateful
for your assistance</i>

15:38.814 --> 15:42.359
<i>because I'm afraid our shared vision
of a sanctuary</i>

15:42.443 --> 15:44.612
<i>for these Inhumans is in jeopardy.</i>

15:44.695 --> 15:45.946
<i>How so?</i>

15:46.030 --> 15:49.199
<i>The Prime Minister recently
sent his personal attaché,</i>

15:49.325 --> 15:51.201
<i>Yuri Krupin, to this site.</i>

15:51.285 --> 15:56.040
<i>The reason, to shut down
this entire project immediately.</i>

15:56.999 --> 15:59.460
The Prime Minister
is against a sanctuary?

15:59.543 --> 16:00.711
Yes.

16:00.878 --> 16:02.630
Because his opposition supports it,

16:02.713 --> 16:05.049
namely, the Ministers
you see before you.

16:05.466 --> 16:07.885
And where is Mr Krupin now?

16:08.844 --> 16:10.012
He...

16:10.721 --> 16:14.391
He's dead, at the hands
of General Androvich.

16:14.516 --> 16:16.810
Minister of Defence,
former KGB assassin.

16:16.894 --> 16:18.729
- Still at it, apparently.
- Yeah.

16:18.854 --> 16:20.731
At least that mystery's solved.

16:20.856 --> 16:24.860
The General always did have a temper.
What... What set him off this time?

16:25.235 --> 16:29.239
He found, uh, the attaché's position
on Inhumans offensive

16:29.323 --> 16:33.035
because the General himself
is an Inhuman.

16:33.535 --> 16:36.246
It's the world's first Inhuman politician.

16:36.372 --> 16:37.581
Yeah.

16:38.415 --> 16:41.085
One who happens to have access
to nuclear launch codes.

16:41.168 --> 16:43.253
That does complicate matters,
doesn't it?

16:43.337 --> 16:45.589
We know you have a history
with the Prime Minister,

16:45.714 --> 16:46.840
so we were hoping that...

16:46.924 --> 16:49.426
You were hoping that I could help you
smooth over this little incident

16:49.551 --> 16:53.430
so that our dream of a sanctuary
wouldn't die here today.

16:53.555 --> 16:54.682
Can you help us?

16:54.765 --> 16:56.100
<i>Son of a bitch is loving this.</i>

16:56.225 --> 16:58.018
He's got them
right in the palm of his hand.

16:58.102 --> 16:59.687
Where is the General now?

16:59.770 --> 17:02.189
He's, uh, on-site, in restraints.

17:02.272 --> 17:04.191
Must be the Inhuman Bob and I saw.

17:04.273 --> 17:05.858
<i>I can help you.</i>

17:06.609 --> 17:12.700
But not because I'm a fan of powered
individuals working for Mother Russia.

17:13.117 --> 17:17.287
Truth is, this is bigger
than any single country's fate.

17:17.371 --> 17:19.623
We are at a tipping point,

17:19.707 --> 17:24.294
where humanity is going to make
some difficult choices

17:24.377 --> 17:27.548
about the preservation
of our very existence,

17:27.631 --> 17:29.550
and these Inhumans...

17:30.217 --> 17:34.638
These Inhumans
are the key to our survival.

17:35.806 --> 17:37.641
And we must ally with them,

17:37.766 --> 17:41.437
build a home for them,
a sanctuary, like you're doing here.

17:42.062 --> 17:45.983
But they will need a leader,
and unfortunately for all of us,

17:46.108 --> 17:48.944
your Prime Minister is not that leader.

17:49.319 --> 17:50.821
But I bet Malick knows who is.

17:51.405 --> 17:53.741
<i>- What do you suggest we do?</i>
<i>- Well, I...</i>

17:53.824 --> 17:55.576
I think the solution is obvious.

17:55.659 --> 17:57.578
I mean, why keep a man in restraints

17:57.661 --> 18:01.749
when he can single-handedly
eliminate the problem for us?

18:01.832 --> 18:03.834
This isn't about a sanctuary.

18:03.917 --> 18:07.755
It is time that we let the General loose.

18:07.838 --> 18:09.673
Malick's staging a coup.

18:21.685 --> 18:22.978
Water.

18:25.939 --> 18:26.982
Drink.

18:28.358 --> 18:29.777
Please.

18:33.322 --> 18:35.949
We know you are not acting alone.

18:36.033 --> 18:37.868
And we do not mean
your pigheaded ex-husband.

18:37.993 --> 18:39.453
Where is he?

18:41.038 --> 18:44.458
There are many intelligence agencies
around the world.

18:44.541 --> 18:47.503
Some are run by incompetents,
but not all.

18:48.003 --> 18:51.048
We know S.H.I.E.L.D. is still there,
in the shadows.

18:51.173 --> 18:53.133
The only one in the shadows
is Gideon Malick.

18:53.383 --> 18:55.219
And you haven't even mentioned him.

18:56.553 --> 18:58.055
I wonder why.

19:04.561 --> 19:06.146
Admit that you're working
with S.H.I.E.L.D.,

19:06.313 --> 19:07.981
cooperating
with the American government,

19:08.065 --> 19:11.318
and perhaps you can spare
your ex-husband from a firing squad.

19:13.153 --> 19:14.571
This is your choice.

19:27.835 --> 19:31.088
We need to get out of here.
What are those guards doing?

19:31.171 --> 19:35.008
Complaining, avoiding work,
taking selfies.

19:35.509 --> 19:37.219
It's guard duty.

19:39.263 --> 19:42.015
Doesn't seem like an Inhuman power,
snapping people's necks.

19:42.099 --> 19:43.934
Anyone can do that.

19:44.059 --> 19:46.436
As opposed to melting metal

19:46.520 --> 19:49.356
or burning holes in people's chests
like your ex.

19:49.565 --> 19:52.693
You're right.
Anyone can snap a person's neck.

19:53.610 --> 19:55.362
You could've paired up with Mack.

19:55.445 --> 19:57.281
Mack I can trust.

19:57.406 --> 19:59.783
Oh, but not me. That's right. I forgot.
We're not friends, are we?

20:03.412 --> 20:05.622
You know, friends don't put
other people's lives

20:05.747 --> 20:07.291
at risk for selfish reasons.

20:08.542 --> 20:09.793
Selfish?

20:10.752 --> 20:12.379
I'd take a bullet for any one of you.

20:12.462 --> 20:14.715
Not for the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo
on the wall, for you.

20:14.798 --> 20:17.885
You were willing to let Andrew die
to get revenge.

20:17.968 --> 20:19.469
That's not what S.H.I.E.L.D.'s about.

20:19.553 --> 20:22.389
No, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s all about the mission,
not the person next to you.

20:22.472 --> 20:26.393
The person
next to you was me.

20:28.145 --> 20:30.397
S.H.I.E.L.D. is about sacrifice,

20:30.480 --> 20:33.400
not for you or me,
but for the greater good.

20:33.483 --> 20:35.652
Even over the ones you love?

20:36.820 --> 20:39.156
Yes. Even them.

20:45.996 --> 20:50.125
I don't know whether I admire you
or feel sad for you or both.

20:51.293 --> 20:52.794
Either way,

20:53.003 --> 20:56.423
I am sorry, May, for all of it.

20:58.300 --> 21:00.677
<i>Heads up.
Malick's on the move.</i>

21:02.012 --> 21:03.180
Where are you, Bob?

21:11.813 --> 21:12.940
South end, upper level.

21:13.023 --> 21:14.983
I think he's going to get the General.

21:41.051 --> 21:42.302
I lost Petrov and Malick!

21:42.386 --> 21:43.971
<i>Daisy, little help?</i>

21:44.054 --> 21:45.472
Give me a sec.

21:46.473 --> 21:47.891
I've got a visual on the General.

21:47.975 --> 21:49.810
He's still locked up.
I'm just not sure where.

21:49.893 --> 21:50.978
<i>Is Malick with him?</i>

21:51.061 --> 21:53.897
No, just a couple of FSO agents
and two guards.

21:54.564 --> 21:55.816
And they're cutting him loose.

21:55.899 --> 21:57.192
We can't let him leave with Malick.

21:57.567 --> 21:59.236
<i>Zephyr to ground team,
we have a cause of death</i>

21:59.361 --> 22:01.405
on the Prime Minister's attaché,
Mr Krupin.

22:01.488 --> 22:02.572
All internal signs show

22:02.656 --> 22:05.575
he was strangled, with fractures
to his larynx and hyoid bone.

22:05.701 --> 22:07.661
Oddly, there are no external abrasions,

22:07.744 --> 22:09.413
ligature marks, or hand impressions.

22:09.496 --> 22:10.664
Like he wasn't even touched.

22:10.747 --> 22:12.165
Could be a psychic ability at work here.

22:12.249 --> 22:13.500
Rather than physical, yeah.

22:13.583 --> 22:15.585
Yeah, but if he can snap bones
without laying a finger on you,

22:15.669 --> 22:18.046
then the Prime Minister's in real danger.

22:19.923 --> 22:22.426
Hold on. I've got eyes on Malick.

22:23.093 --> 22:24.678
The General's not with him.

22:24.761 --> 22:26.346
Just his security detail.

22:26.430 --> 22:28.098
What's Malick's play here?

22:28.181 --> 22:31.518
He sows the seeds of a coup,
then leaves without the assassin.

22:31.601 --> 22:33.437
Must be some other angle.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.522
Daisy, where's the General now?

22:35.605 --> 22:36.857
<i>You still have eyes on him?</i>

22:36.940 --> 22:39.526
Hold on. I'm still trying to get Bobbi
through a door.

22:40.193 --> 22:43.780
Converting to Unicode, and...

22:44.281 --> 22:46.283
<i>Spasibo,</i> Daisy!

22:46.366 --> 22:47.367
<i>De nada.</i>

22:47.451 --> 22:49.453
<i>- Pretty sure that's not Russian.</i>
- Whatever.

22:49.536 --> 22:52.706
Bobbi, hang a right at the next hallway.
That should take you to the General.

22:52.789 --> 22:55.709
But you better get there quick,
'cause he's free.

22:57.461 --> 22:59.212
What the... Did you see that?

22:59.296 --> 23:00.380
See what?

23:00.464 --> 23:02.382
The hell if I know.

23:02.466 --> 23:03.800
Is this feed recording?

23:03.884 --> 23:05.886
Yeah. Let me roll it back.

23:07.971 --> 23:09.639
Sir? Sir, we have incoming.

23:09.765 --> 23:11.600
Looks like helicopters
headed for the compound.

23:13.477 --> 23:15.562
They're not flying
in standard military formation.

23:15.645 --> 23:17.230
Enhancing satellite imagery.

23:17.314 --> 23:20.484
Russian military typically uses Mi-8s.
That's not what those are.

23:20.567 --> 23:23.945
No, sir. Scans show these are
AW139s, four of them.

23:24.446 --> 23:27.074
That's the Prime Minister's detail.
He's coming here.

23:27.157 --> 23:28.700
Malick isn't taking
the General anywhere

23:28.784 --> 23:29.993
because he doesn't have to.

23:30.535 --> 23:32.120
Open the comms.

23:32.662 --> 23:34.122
Everyone listen up.

23:34.206 --> 23:36.333
This hit is going down here and now.

23:36.416 --> 23:38.251
The Russian Prime Minister is arriving,

23:38.335 --> 23:40.087
and there's an Inhuman assassin
on the loose.

23:40.170 --> 23:41.213
You need to stop him.

23:46.885 --> 23:49.638
Stop him how?
We don't even know what he can do.

24:01.608 --> 24:03.068
Malick's getting away!

24:03.151 --> 24:04.319
We could grab one of those trucks.

24:04.402 --> 24:05.821
<i>Coulson, do we pursue?</i>

24:05.904 --> 24:08.323
Prime Minister is landing
on the north side of the plant.

24:08.406 --> 24:09.741
Negative. Forget about Malick.

24:09.825 --> 24:11.118
But he's right bloody there!

24:11.201 --> 24:13.829
Protect the Prime Minister.
He's walking into a trap.

24:13.912 --> 24:15.080
You need to get in there now.

24:25.924 --> 24:27.843
We have eyes on the Prime Minister.

24:27.926 --> 24:29.344
And he's not alone.

24:29.427 --> 24:30.637
Prime Minister, welcome.

24:30.720 --> 24:33.098
Is that our General Inhuman right there?

24:33.473 --> 24:34.599
It is.

24:36.268 --> 24:37.310
Thank you so much...

24:37.394 --> 24:38.687
Gang's all here.

24:38.770 --> 24:39.813
What's the plan?

24:39.896 --> 24:41.064
May and Hunter,

24:41.148 --> 24:42.649
<i>you secure the Prime Minister.</i>

24:42.732 --> 24:45.235
Daisy, Bobbi, Mack,
contain the General.

24:45.318 --> 24:46.987
Try to get him outside.

24:47.070 --> 24:49.156
We'll send the containment module
down to the south exit.

24:49.948 --> 24:51.616
Yeah, be careful.
He's an assassin,

24:51.700 --> 24:54.619
and we don't know
what his powers are yet.

24:56.371 --> 24:57.747
Perhaps we do.

24:58.540 --> 25:04.045
Prime Minister, this plan, I believe,
is in our Federation's best interests.

25:04.129 --> 25:05.297
We'll need a distraction.

25:05.380 --> 25:08.717
I have an idea,
but it involves May hitting people.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.427
If you could take a moment and look...

25:10.510 --> 25:13.054
My attaché should be here.

25:13.138 --> 25:14.306
Where is Yuri?

25:20.187 --> 25:23.356
He could not see the error of his ways.

25:24.524 --> 25:25.609
So,

25:27.444 --> 25:28.987
you are all traitors, then?

25:43.752 --> 25:45.003
This way, Prime Minister.

25:56.640 --> 25:57.766
<i>Somebody report.</i>

25:57.849 --> 26:00.894
<i>Do we have the Inhuman at a safe
distance from the Prime Minister?</i>

26:03.355 --> 26:05.273
Yeah, Bobbi's got him.

26:22.666 --> 26:25.460
I don't speak Russian,
but I know a threat when I hear one.

26:52.362 --> 26:53.905
He's out cold.

26:54.281 --> 26:55.991
Where the hell did it go?

26:57.492 --> 26:58.994
Where'd the General go?

26:59.077 --> 27:00.161
<i>Zephyr to ground team.</i>

27:00.287 --> 27:01.830
What's happening down there?

27:01.913 --> 27:04.332
- Sir, we lost the General.
- He controls his shadow.

27:04.416 --> 27:05.750
My powers didn't faze it.

27:05.834 --> 27:07.377
<i>It's not just a shadow.</i>

27:07.460 --> 27:09.004
Fitz and I believe
the General has the ability

27:09.087 --> 27:11.172
to manifest a form
of sentient dark force,

27:11.256 --> 27:13.091
able to shift its density at will.

27:13.174 --> 27:15.135
Judging by the way he's elsewhere
at the moment,

27:15.218 --> 27:16.761
it operates independently of him.

27:16.845 --> 27:18.722
Can you cut to the part
where you tell us how we beat it?

27:18.805 --> 27:20.098
Technically, you can't.

27:20.181 --> 27:22.017
Not the answer we were looking for.

27:22.100 --> 27:23.351
<i>And the Prime Minister?</i>

27:23.435 --> 27:24.936
Safe for now.

27:26.062 --> 27:27.731
Don't panic, sir, but your life is in...

27:27.814 --> 27:29.065
For Mother Russia!

27:30.191 --> 27:32.944
As I was saying, don't panic, sir,
but your life is in danger.

27:34.904 --> 27:37.699
But if it can go solid,
then we should be able to fight it.

27:37.782 --> 27:39.451
Fight it, yes, but you can't destroy it.

27:39.534 --> 27:40.869
The General can always
manifest another...

27:40.952 --> 27:43.747
General. We have to take out
the General.

27:45.749 --> 27:47.083
Oh, damn.

27:50.045 --> 27:52.797
- You ready, <i>sestra?
- Da.</i>

28:23.453 --> 28:24.496
How'd you do that?

28:24.579 --> 28:26.956
Did you see that?
How the hell are we supposed to...

28:28.833 --> 28:30.043
Daisy!

28:39.219 --> 28:40.970
<i>Whatever this thing is,
it's here.</i>

28:41.054 --> 28:42.639
I'll get Daisy out of here.

28:42.722 --> 28:43.807
You go end this.

28:43.890 --> 28:47.018
- You can barely walk.
- Barbara. Go.

28:47.310 --> 28:49.062
<i>What do I do? What do I do?</i>

28:49.145 --> 28:50.522
Hang on, Hunter!

28:50.605 --> 28:51.981
Bob, whatever you're gonna do,
do it now!

29:21.678 --> 29:23.430
Sir, are you okay?

29:28.560 --> 29:30.520
Hunter, are you okay?

29:33.690 --> 29:35.942
Hunter, please answer me.

30:08.224 --> 30:09.684
Are you all right, love?

30:10.226 --> 30:11.644
Better now.

30:13.438 --> 30:15.607
- I thought...
- Yeah, I know.

30:16.232 --> 30:17.525
Me, too.

30:17.984 --> 30:20.278
I don't know what frightened me more,

30:20.361 --> 30:22.155
the firing squad or that shadow muppet.

30:23.573 --> 30:24.782
We were lucky.

30:26.451 --> 30:27.911
I was lucky.

30:28.828 --> 30:30.079
You were good.

30:33.208 --> 30:36.252
I bet you could do
with a cheeseburger right now, huh?

30:38.254 --> 30:40.757
There's no cheeseburgers
where we're going.

30:47.472 --> 30:49.682
If there's a way out of this,

30:50.683 --> 30:52.018
I can't see it.

30:54.521 --> 30:56.689
Not where everyone wins.

31:01.819 --> 31:03.947
Maybe not everyone should.

31:17.627 --> 31:19.712
I don't believe any of this.

31:19.796 --> 31:22.715
These two are obviously working
for either your government directly

31:22.799 --> 31:25.343
or indirectly, as agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

31:25.426 --> 31:28.763
You know very well, Prime Minister,
there is no S.H.I.E.L.D.

31:28.846 --> 31:30.056
It was dismantled.

31:30.139 --> 31:32.850
Mr President,
do you think we are all naive?

31:32.934 --> 31:34.477
S.H.I.E.L.D. is alive and well

31:34.561 --> 31:36.938
and working with your government
to get ahead of us.

31:37.021 --> 31:39.357
Ahead of you?
What are you talking about?

31:39.440 --> 31:41.442
There is a new arms race in our future,

31:41.526 --> 31:43.194
the race for powered individuals.

31:43.278 --> 31:44.404
You know this.

31:44.487 --> 31:48.741
What I know, Dmitri,
is that there was an attempt on your life.

31:48.825 --> 31:50.368
A coup.

31:50.451 --> 31:54.414
And if I were you, I'd be grateful
to the people who intervened.

31:56.082 --> 31:58.918
Let's be frank, Matthew.

31:59.002 --> 32:01.588
What matters here
is only how things appear.

32:01.671 --> 32:04.507
And for me,
this appears to be a disaster.

32:04.591 --> 32:06.551
This incident will go public,

32:06.634 --> 32:09.429
and I will have to explain
how not one, not two,

32:09.512 --> 32:12.265
but three members of my government
were murdered.

32:13.099 --> 32:17.562
To be fair, two of them
were trying to kill you, sir.

32:19.022 --> 32:21.357
Remind me, who is this man?

32:21.524 --> 32:23.693
Advisor to our ATCU.

32:25.194 --> 32:27.447
He, uh... He tracks enhanced threats.

32:28.072 --> 32:29.782
Threats like your very own
Minister of Defence,

32:29.866 --> 32:33.369
General Androvich, who I believe
was trying to assassinate you.

32:34.370 --> 32:35.872
So you claim.

32:37.040 --> 32:39.125
Mr President,
if you do not wish to escalate

32:39.208 --> 32:41.210
hostilities between our nations,

32:41.377 --> 32:43.171
you will do what is right.

32:43.254 --> 32:46.382
Someone must pay
for what happened here.

32:46.466 --> 32:48.384
And it will not be me.

32:58.478 --> 33:01.105
Hi. My name is Phil Coulson.

33:02.065 --> 33:03.524
<i>Pleasure to meet you, sir.</i>

33:03.608 --> 33:05.526
I'd like to ask you a few questions,
if that's all right.

33:09.113 --> 33:10.198
Why can't we hear them?

33:10.281 --> 33:11.991
What happened to the sound?

33:12.075 --> 33:13.993
We have about 90 seconds.

33:14.077 --> 33:16.704
When Fitz triggers the EMP,
you'll go out that door to your left.

33:16.788 --> 33:18.039
- There are two guards...
- Sir, we can't.

33:18.122 --> 33:19.207
Take them out, then head for the ship...

33:19.290 --> 33:20.333
An extraction won't work here.

33:20.416 --> 33:22.418
We can't risk that.
It'll expose all of you.

33:22.502 --> 33:25.546
Once you're back, we'll change
your identities, move your families,

33:25.630 --> 33:27.131
and unfortunately,
you'll be done in the field...

33:27.256 --> 33:30.551
Sir, I think that we've proven we're not
built for the lab or for office work.

33:30.635 --> 33:32.303
Or prison.

33:36.516 --> 33:38.017
What other options are there?

33:38.267 --> 33:39.560
Go on trial?

33:39.644 --> 33:42.230
Expose yourselves as members
of a terrorist organisation?

33:42.313 --> 33:43.940
Because that's what people
think S.H.I.E.L.D. is.

33:44.023 --> 33:47.110
We took an oath. To be the shield.

33:47.193 --> 33:48.903
To protect those in danger.

33:48.986 --> 33:53.700
Well, now S.H.I.E.L.D., this team,
is in the crosshairs.

33:53.783 --> 33:57.662
And the right thing for us to do
is take the bullet.

34:02.125 --> 34:04.043
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

34:07.004 --> 34:08.380
We've discussed it.

34:10.550 --> 34:12.051
It's time.

34:18.349 --> 34:20.143
I'll have your things sent to you.

34:22.853 --> 34:25.231
<i>And frankly,
you should be more careful</i>

34:25.313 --> 34:27.984
<i>when making your vacation plans
next time.</i>

34:29.985 --> 34:31.821
We are so sorry, sir.

34:39.829 --> 34:41.371
It's all yours, Inspector.

34:41.496 --> 34:42.498
<i>Merci.</i>

34:45.585 --> 34:47.587
So, you do not work for S.H.I.E.L.D.?

34:47.670 --> 34:50.172
- I do not.
- Doesn't exist any more.

34:52.382 --> 34:55.636
And you're telling me they don't work
for any US government agency.

34:55.719 --> 34:57.764
No. They do not.

34:59.098 --> 35:00.266
And they never will.

35:01.851 --> 35:03.186
You satisfied, Dmitri?

35:05.396 --> 35:06.939
One last thing.

35:09.400 --> 35:12.570
I would like to thank you both
for your bravery

35:12.695 --> 35:16.365
and for the sacrifice you made,
giving up your vacation.

35:17.784 --> 35:19.744
Whether anyone
will ever admit it or not,

35:19.869 --> 35:22.497
you saved the Prime Minister's life,

35:22.580 --> 35:23.873
and, doubly fortunate for him,

35:23.956 --> 35:25.875
managed to wipe out
his entire opposition.

35:27.376 --> 35:29.462
They're all dead now, so well done.

35:29.545 --> 35:30.588
Coulson.

35:30.713 --> 35:33.090
Wouldn't you agree, Prime Minister?

35:33.883 --> 35:36.552
Seems to me they're free to go.

35:59.575 --> 36:01.285
What happened to the extraction plan?

36:01.744 --> 36:03.079
You never gave us the signal.

36:03.162 --> 36:04.664
Where are Hunter and Bobbi?

36:05.581 --> 36:06.916
They're not coming back.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.502
They've been disavowed.

36:09.585 --> 36:10.628
What're you talking about?

36:10.753 --> 36:12.129
There were no good options.

36:12.255 --> 36:13.756
I had to make a deal.

36:13.840 --> 36:17.301
We were lucky President Ellis
even got Interpol to step in.

36:17.426 --> 36:19.554
They walk free,
but they cannot be agents.

36:19.637 --> 36:21.055
So that's it? We're just leaving them?

36:21.138 --> 36:23.349
It was all we could do
to keep them from being executed.

36:23.432 --> 36:25.434
Relations between the President
and the Prime Minister

36:25.518 --> 36:28.771
are already badly strained
because of the growing alien threat.

36:29.105 --> 36:31.482
And if they found out
S.H.I.E.L.D. was up and running,

36:31.607 --> 36:32.692
training Inhumans as agents...

36:32.775 --> 36:34.110
It would be bad.

36:34.443 --> 36:36.779
Like Cold War bad.

36:36.863 --> 36:38.781
Bobbi and Hunter
never cracked under questioning,

36:39.115 --> 36:40.616
even to save each other.

36:40.741 --> 36:42.285
They did that for S.H.I.E.L.D.

36:42.410 --> 36:44.829
They did that for us,
and they paid the price.

36:45.329 --> 36:46.747
No, they...

36:47.623 --> 36:49.542
They just can't take the fall.

36:49.625 --> 36:51.544
Mack, it was their choice.

36:51.627 --> 36:55.298
After everything they've done,
they deserve that choice.

36:55.673 --> 36:58.759
Believe me, guys,
I'm gonna miss them, too.

37:25.661 --> 37:28.873
- What about Trinidad and Tobago?
- Always loved the name,

37:28.998 --> 37:33.586
but I once had a bad run-in there
with a Nigerian drug dealer, so...

37:33.669 --> 37:35.338
Maybe Bora-Bora?

37:35.463 --> 37:37.673
- Ooh.
- Think we'll be followed there?

37:38.341 --> 37:39.926
I don't know.

37:40.009 --> 37:43.596
Think it'll be a long time before anybody
in the intelligence business trusts us.

37:43.679 --> 37:45.348
I'm afraid they never will, love.

37:45.473 --> 37:47.516
- Should we get the check?
- Mmm.

37:52.355 --> 37:53.481
I didn't order that.

37:53.564 --> 37:56.192
I know. You've got an admirer.

37:56.317 --> 37:57.610
Who?

37:57.693 --> 38:00.029
They asked me not to say.

38:04.909 --> 38:06.285
Oh, that's Jemma.

38:06.369 --> 38:08.037
Why doesn't she...

38:12.041 --> 38:13.542
Oh, she can't, can she?

38:15.753 --> 38:17.880
You guys must be popular.

38:20.758 --> 38:22.343
Fitz is here.

38:30.768 --> 38:31.936
It's a spy's goodbye.

41:14.223 --> 41:15.391
Pull!

41:18.978 --> 41:20.396
Nice shot, Dad.

41:21.397 --> 41:22.481
Hey, sweetie.

41:23.315 --> 41:24.900
Early start this morning?

41:24.984 --> 41:26.152
Yeah.

41:28.154 --> 41:29.655
Russia didn't go well, did it?

41:31.031 --> 41:32.658
No, things got complicated.

41:32.741 --> 41:34.410
Let me guess, S.H.I.E.L.D.

41:34.535 --> 41:36.829
I'd rather not talk about it.

41:36.996 --> 41:38.164
Okay.

41:39.331 --> 41:41.083
They don't know he's back, do they?

41:41.250 --> 41:43.586
- Nah, Coulson has no clue.
- Good.

41:45.045 --> 41:47.381
So, when do I get to meet
you-know-who?

41:48.883 --> 41:52.094
Not yet.
He's still gathering himself and,

41:53.596 --> 41:55.848
I'm still trying to figure out
what his plans are.

41:55.931 --> 41:58.100
Well, I know what they are.

41:59.435 --> 42:02.688
He's gonna change the world.
Pull!

42:04.273 --> 42:05.357
Whoa!

42:06.775 --> 42:08.611
That's my girl.
