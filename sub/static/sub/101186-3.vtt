WEBVTT

00:07.641 --> 00:10.043
‐ I am a fully grown half‐angel.

00:10.077 --> 00:12.279
I am the guardian.
‐ I'm sworn to protect Waverly!

00:12.312 --> 00:14.948
‐ They're working on some
inter‐dimensional gateway.

00:14.982 --> 00:16.984
‐ It's the 2005 chili cook‐off
all over again.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.619
‐ I'm gonna be waiting for you

00:18.652 --> 00:20.120
back in Purgatory.

00:20.153 --> 00:21.288
‐ Ahh!

00:21.321 --> 00:23.290
I'm here, and we gotta
get back there!

00:23.323 --> 00:24.491
Ahh!

00:24.525 --> 00:26.326
‐ No...

00:26.360 --> 00:27.294
‐ Waverly.

00:28.328 --> 00:30.564
‐ The town...
‐ You've been gone 18 months,

00:30.597 --> 00:32.733
three weeks, and four days.

00:32.766 --> 00:34.301
All of you have.

00:34.334 --> 00:36.537
(intense music)

00:37.471 --> 00:40.374
(tense music)

00:40.407 --> 00:43.277
‐ Someone has been handing out
hemp neckties.

00:44.011 --> 00:45.946
‐ That's a clear fashion don't.

00:46.380 --> 00:47.581
Who the hell? And why?

00:47.614 --> 00:48.949
‐ Frontier justice.

00:48.982 --> 00:50.517
Retribution must not only
be paid,

00:50.551 --> 00:52.119
it must be seen to be paid.

00:52.152 --> 00:55.055
‐ The old‐timey version of
"pics or it didn't happen".

00:55.689 --> 00:57.424
Something here is pretty off.

00:57.457 --> 00:58.525
Shorty's.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.961
We think better with a little
fire in our bellies.

01:00.994 --> 01:02.996
(soft music)

01:03.030 --> 01:05.032
(indistinct chattering)

01:07.134 --> 01:09.303
Uh, Nedley and I were here,

01:09.336 --> 01:11.939
after you followed Waverly
up the stairs.

01:11.972 --> 01:13.640
We drank your tequila,

01:13.674 --> 01:15.709
uh, but we did not macramé.

01:15.742 --> 01:18.545
So unless this is just
a surprise makeover

01:18.579 --> 01:20.614
by The Property Brothers...

01:20.647 --> 01:23.150
On occasion, I will put it on

01:23.183 --> 01:26.086
in the middle of the afternoon,
if I have cleaning to do.

01:28.021 --> 01:29.156
‐ What is this menu?

01:29.189 --> 01:31.592
"Gunfight At The Okra Corral."

01:31.625 --> 01:33.527
What the hell
is a Cock Holliday?

01:33.560 --> 01:36.229
‐ It says
it is chicken bone broth.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.565
Is that not simply soup?
‐ Wynonna?

01:38.599 --> 01:40.133
(sighs)
‐ Chrissy Nedley.

01:40.167 --> 01:42.102
Are you a sight for sore livers.

01:42.135 --> 01:45.105
‐ How dare you?!
(Man): Hey, whoa!

01:45.138 --> 01:46.940
‐ What the fig, Chrissy?!

01:46.974 --> 01:48.375
‐ Wynonna.
‐ Ahh!

01:48.408 --> 01:50.544
(grunting)

01:50.577 --> 01:52.379
(guns clicking)

01:52.412 --> 01:54.047
‐ Let her go.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.187
Alright, say your piece,
Chrissy.

02:00.220 --> 02:01.688
‐ Say your piece, Chrissy,
just say your piece.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.423
If you wanna chat, I can chat.
I'm a good listener.

02:03.457 --> 02:07.060
‐ Wynonna Earp, I am placing you
under citizen's arrest.

02:07.094 --> 02:09.229
For the murder of my father.

02:09.262 --> 02:11.298
Randall Nedley.

02:11.331 --> 02:15.168
(music intensifies)

02:16.436 --> 02:18.505
‐ It's just so good to be home.

02:23.010 --> 02:25.278
♪ 'Cause I gave you
all I got to give ♪

02:25.312 --> 02:28.015
♪ I know that ain't
no way to live ♪

02:28.048 --> 02:30.617
♪ So I told that devil ♪

02:30.651 --> 02:32.919
♪ To take you back ♪

02:33.587 --> 02:35.522
♪ I told that devil ♪

02:35.555 --> 02:38.191
♪ To take you back ♪

02:39.459 --> 02:41.061
‐ I would never hurt Nedley!

02:41.094 --> 02:42.963
‐ As if we'd take the word
of an Earp!

02:42.996 --> 02:44.364
‐ Your dad did. He trusted me!

02:44.398 --> 02:46.967
‐ Unhand her at once!
‐ Nedley can't be dead.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.135
‐ We demand proof.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.070
‐ He was last seen with Wynonna.

02:50.103 --> 02:52.005
And that's when she disappeared
for a year and a half!

02:52.039 --> 02:55.142
What a coincidence!
‐ Your dad was helping me!

02:55.175 --> 02:55.976
He was hurt,

02:56.009 --> 02:58.278
but I left him safe
with Mercedes!

02:58.311 --> 02:59.546
Wait. When did you say?

02:59.579 --> 03:01.615
‐ We were gone mere days.
You lie.

03:01.648 --> 03:02.649
(Wynonna): No, no!

03:02.683 --> 03:04.251
‐ We've been waiting too long.

03:04.284 --> 03:05.385
‐ No!

03:05.419 --> 03:07.954
(crowd shouting angrily)

03:08.955 --> 03:10.924
‐ Doc!
(screaming)

03:10.957 --> 03:13.527
‐ Wynonna!
(gunshots)

03:14.361 --> 03:17.397
‐ Put the rope down
and back away from the woman.

03:19.666 --> 03:21.301
‐ Sheriff.

03:21.334 --> 03:23.303
‐ That's not the sheriff.
Where's Nicole?

03:25.706 --> 03:27.340
‐ Miss Chrissy,

03:27.374 --> 03:29.109
your dad lived his life
for the law.

03:29.142 --> 03:31.011
What would he think
of your behavior now?

03:31.044 --> 03:33.013
‐ You didn't know him.
‐ No.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.715
But I do know this is not
the way we do things

03:34.748 --> 03:36.216
in Purgatory.

03:36.683 --> 03:38.952
(Man): We want justice!

03:41.188 --> 03:42.556
‐ Thank you.

03:42.589 --> 03:43.924
(Woman): Yeah, this isn't right!

03:43.957 --> 03:45.358
‐ Just like the criminal vermin

03:45.392 --> 03:47.227
we hung last Monday,

03:47.260 --> 03:49.930
Miss Earp shall have
a trial first.

03:51.131 --> 03:52.966
‐ Get Waverly! Get Nicole!

03:52.999 --> 03:55.102
‐ I shall get everyone.

03:59.272 --> 04:02.142
(Waverly humming)

04:04.544 --> 04:06.246
‐ Sup?
‐ Whoa!

04:07.280 --> 04:09.649
‐ Valdez. Rachel Valdez.

04:09.683 --> 04:10.951
‐ Hi.

04:10.984 --> 04:13.153
I'm, uh...
‐ Cold?

04:15.021 --> 04:16.957
‐ Yeah. Frozen.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.425
I mean, I'm practically Elsa!

04:19.960 --> 04:23.163
I had no idea you were...
‐ Kombucha?

04:23.196 --> 04:24.131
‐ Pardon?

04:24.164 --> 04:26.533
‐ I make it myself.
And after last night,

04:26.566 --> 04:28.201
I bet you need some hydration.

04:29.069 --> 04:31.471
(giggling)
‐ Mmm.

04:31.505 --> 04:33.507
Microbes.

04:33.540 --> 04:35.475
So, you're staying here?

04:35.509 --> 04:37.444
(bell ringing)

04:37.477 --> 04:39.246
‐ Batman in the microwave!

04:39.279 --> 04:41.181
‐ What? What is that?

04:41.214 --> 04:43.350
‐ There's something in the trap.
‐ Which one?

04:44.117 --> 04:46.153
‐ Behind the barn.
‐ What are we trapping?

04:46.186 --> 04:47.521
(gun clicking)

04:47.554 --> 04:49.456
‐ Monsters.

04:49.489 --> 04:50.357
‐ Huh.

04:50.390 --> 04:52.893
(intense music)

04:58.665 --> 05:00.300
‐ There's ten traps
on the homestead.

05:00.333 --> 05:02.636
We gotta do a full
circuit check every two hours.

05:02.669 --> 05:04.504
‐ I thought the curse
was broken.

05:04.538 --> 05:05.972
‐ Traps aren't for Revenants.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.674
There's all sorts of things
in the woods now.

05:07.707 --> 05:09.242
‐ And one of them,

05:09.276 --> 05:11.511
this big ugly troll,
wants in here bad.

05:11.545 --> 05:14.214
(Doc): Oh, tarnation!

05:15.315 --> 05:17.984
Thank you for the exceptionally
tight welcome.

05:18.018 --> 05:21.321
‐ Rachel, Doc, Doc, Rachel.

05:21.354 --> 05:23.156
‐ Sup?

05:23.190 --> 05:24.424
‐ Don't move.

05:25.125 --> 05:28.061
‐ I am rather determined not to.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.097
Ohh!

05:31.131 --> 05:33.500
It is good to see you,
Sheriff Haught.

05:34.100 --> 05:36.570
‐ Yeah, well, these days,
it's just Nicole, or...

05:36.603 --> 05:38.405
"that crazy ginger bitch."

05:41.174 --> 05:41.975
‐ God, it's...

05:42.008 --> 05:43.643
I'm so, so glad you made it,
Henry.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.045
(smooch)
Ugh!

05:45.078 --> 05:46.947
You smell aggressively bad.

05:46.980 --> 05:49.115
‐ Yeah, we use skunk juice
to bait the traps.

05:49.149 --> 05:50.951
‐ Wynonna isn't marinating
in skunk juice

05:50.984 --> 05:52.085
in one of these, is she?

05:52.118 --> 05:54.354
‐ Wynonna is in jail.
‐ What?

05:54.387 --> 05:55.488
‐ They have framed her.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.958
For the murder of Randy Nedley.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.659
(intense music)

05:59.693 --> 06:00.961
‐ Who are you?

06:00.994 --> 06:02.495
‐ You can call me the Sheriff.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.564
‐ Okay, then you can call me
an Uber.

06:04.598 --> 06:07.667
Ooh! Uh...

06:07.701 --> 06:09.569
‐ Back away from the glass,
6‐1‐3‐3.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.104
‐ Dude...

06:11.137 --> 06:13.039
There's a guy in there,
I'm not going in there.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.174
‐ Yeah, main cell's
chock‐a‐block.

06:14.207 --> 06:17.477
But believe you me,
he's far from the worst of 'em.

06:19.446 --> 06:20.614
‐ Uh...

06:20.647 --> 06:23.183
Assless chap?
I want my phone call!

06:23.984 --> 06:27.020
I want my phone call!
‐ Sorry I can't hear you.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.055
‐ I demand a phone call!

06:31.625 --> 06:35.161
Who are you?
‐ Casey. You?

06:35.195 --> 06:37.264
‐ Local nogoodnik, Wynonna Earp.

06:37.297 --> 06:39.466
‐ Ahh!

06:39.499 --> 06:40.533
I thought I'd be safe in here!

06:40.567 --> 06:42.402
‐ Wow. Didn't even
have to steal your pudding cup

06:42.435 --> 06:44.004
to establish who's boss. Nice.

06:44.037 --> 06:47.407
‐ From demons
and famous demon hunters.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.511
‐ Back up one sec.

06:51.544 --> 06:54.948
Pretend I haven't been here
for, say, a year and a half,

06:54.981 --> 06:56.583
and just explain to me.

06:56.616 --> 06:58.051
‐ Uh, since the town
was evacuated

06:58.084 --> 07:00.487
for the forest fires?
‐ Say I remember that.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.589
‐ Oh, well,
the townspeople left,

07:02.622 --> 07:03.556
but demons came.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.492
You know when there's,
like, a bush party?

07:05.525 --> 07:07.327
And nobody knows
who started it,

07:07.360 --> 07:09.496
but everybody hears
about it somehow?

07:09.529 --> 07:10.964
They all just started
showing up.

07:10.997 --> 07:12.165
‐ Everybody shows up for bush.

07:12.198 --> 07:14.868
‐ Yeah, the townspeople
were allowed to come back home,

07:14.901 --> 07:16.670
and there was, like,
an ongoing demon rager,

07:16.703 --> 07:19.005
centered around the woods.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.441
‐ The stairs.
‐ I'm not, I'm not staring!

07:21.474 --> 07:23.043
Also I'm only a half‐demon!

07:23.076 --> 07:24.110
So, you know,
please don't shoot!

07:24.144 --> 07:25.245
‐ Casey, don't be a weenie.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.380
I don't even
have my gun anymore.

07:27.414 --> 07:28.581
In here...

07:29.249 --> 07:31.151
Obviously the Sheriff
would have taken it.

07:31.651 --> 07:33.520
‐ Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

07:33.553 --> 07:34.621
(sighing)

07:34.654 --> 07:37.324
‐ So the woods are full
of monsters.

07:37.357 --> 07:38.925
‐ Crawling with 'em.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.594
These days, the only place
scarier than in here...

07:41.628 --> 07:43.396
is out there.

07:43.430 --> 07:46.333
(birds squawking)

07:48.568 --> 07:52.005
(brakes squealing)

07:53.506 --> 07:55.909
(ominous music)

07:56.509 --> 07:58.912
(metal clanging)

08:02.148 --> 08:03.984
(screaming, monster growling)

08:08.688 --> 08:12.225
‐ I have a half‐knitted scarf
I was making him for Christmas.

08:12.258 --> 08:14.160
His waders
are still in the barn.

08:14.194 --> 08:15.261
‐ Yeah. I know, Waves.

08:15.295 --> 08:17.630
It's tough to think
of a world without Randy Nedley.

08:17.664 --> 08:21.434
(kettle whistling)
‐ How can he just... be gone?

08:21.468 --> 08:24.404
‐ It was months of chaos
after the evacuation ended.

08:24.437 --> 08:26.306
People came back, yeah, but...

08:26.339 --> 08:29.142
to be blunt,
others just disappeared.

08:29.642 --> 08:30.610
‐ Kate?

08:30.643 --> 08:32.645
‐ I saw her on
one of the evacuation trains.

08:32.679 --> 08:33.713
But beyond that...

08:33.747 --> 08:35.715
‐ Jeremy? And Robin?

08:35.749 --> 08:37.217
‐ Jeremy's getting by,

08:37.250 --> 08:39.619
though I haven't heard
from him in months.

08:39.652 --> 08:41.621
Robin...

08:43.490 --> 08:45.258
‐ How could we have been
in that garden

08:45.291 --> 08:46.493
for a year and a half?

08:46.526 --> 08:49.596
‐ We were not.
Time must be differentiated,

08:49.629 --> 08:51.331
fluid in some manner.

08:51.364 --> 08:54.200
‐ Yeah, God,
it's such a mind‐frog.

08:54.234 --> 08:55.802
I mean, how old even am I?

08:55.835 --> 08:57.170
(gasps)

08:57.203 --> 08:58.772
I missed so many
Property Brothers!

08:59.706 --> 09:01.207
‐ I feel that.

09:01.241 --> 09:03.243
‐ At least if we'd have lived
the past 18 months,

09:03.276 --> 09:04.377
it would be easier to‐‐

09:04.411 --> 09:06.880
‐ There was nothing easy
about those months. Not a thing.

09:06.913 --> 09:09.349
‐ No, I didn't mean it
like that.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.718
Not like that at all.

09:11.751 --> 09:13.553
‐ There's no almond milk.

09:13.586 --> 09:16.423
It's still hard
to get some things. Sorry.

09:16.456 --> 09:19.859
‐ Please don't say you're sorry
anymore, okay?

09:19.893 --> 09:21.428
You don't need to be.

09:21.461 --> 09:23.630
‐ What you have done, Sheriff...

09:27.000 --> 09:28.868
Nicole...

09:28.902 --> 09:30.870
is nothing short of heroic.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.439
In the face of all adversity,

09:32.472 --> 09:35.208
you alone
kept the homestead safe.

09:36.309 --> 09:37.710
‐ I had Rachel.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.546
And the Earp shotguns.

09:40.480 --> 09:43.616
And Wynonna
still hasn't come home.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.252
‐ They have to let us see her.

09:46.286 --> 09:49.556
‐ Wynonna said she last left
Nedley with Mercedes.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.258
What is the news on her?
‐ It's not good.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.227
There's a new demon bar
out on Horsehead Trail.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.763
‐ And, though given
the circumstances,

09:56.796 --> 09:58.531
it is but a trifle...

09:59.699 --> 10:01.801
is there word of my Charlene?

10:22.956 --> 10:25.492
‐ Vacation is over, assholes.

10:26.826 --> 10:30.230
It is time for a Holliday.

10:32.699 --> 10:34.467
‐ The club is members only.

10:35.335 --> 10:36.736
‐ Well, here are my dues.

10:39.172 --> 10:41.875
Salutations, Patrons of...

10:41.908 --> 10:44.144
The Glory Hole?

10:44.577 --> 10:47.247
Is that really the name
of this latrine?

10:47.280 --> 10:49.849
‐ "Why should I obtain by force

10:49.883 --> 10:53.553
that which I can obtain
by cheating?"

10:53.586 --> 10:56.389
John Henry Holliday,

10:56.422 --> 10:59.792
born 1851, Griffin, Georgia.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.194
Amon.

11:02.462 --> 11:04.631
I'm the proprietor
of this latrine.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.700
You sure you wouldn't rather
cheat than force your way in?

11:07.734 --> 11:09.602
‐ Bring me Ms. Gardner.

11:09.636 --> 11:12.672
Unless you fancy
kissing hardwood too.

11:12.705 --> 11:14.340
‐ Hmm, well...

11:14.374 --> 11:16.309
There were parts
of that scenario

11:16.342 --> 11:19.179
which I found enticing.

11:20.980 --> 11:23.750
‐ Big fan, Mr. H.

11:25.818 --> 11:27.587
‐ It's a demon bar.

11:28.454 --> 11:32.625
You think we're not thrilled
to welcome an undead legend?

11:34.961 --> 11:37.430
‐ Not the worst thing
I've been called.

11:37.463 --> 11:38.631
(chuckles)

11:38.665 --> 11:39.766

11:39.799 --> 11:42.335

to my Glory Hole.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.437
(man cheering)
That's right, bonbons.

11:44.470 --> 11:46.773
It's time for your nicest vice,

11:46.806 --> 11:49.609
the mistress of the ruthless.

11:49.642 --> 11:51.744

they're gonna lock up my sister

12:06.492 --> 12:08.861
for the maybe murder
of my favorite Sheriff,

12:08.895 --> 12:10.763
present company excepted,
of course.

12:10.797 --> 12:12.232
‐ Present company
not the Sheriff.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.400
‐ Yeah, and what the hell's
that about?!

12:14.434 --> 12:16.336
‐ Yeah. You haven't met
the "they" yet.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.671
‐ Nicole. I am gonna go to town

12:18.705 --> 12:20.607
and I am gonna kick so much ass,

12:20.640 --> 12:22.308
I might go up a shoe size.

12:23.309 --> 12:25.411
‐ God, I've missed you,
Waverly Earp.

12:26.846 --> 12:28.881
‐ Though how do I,
an adult woman,

12:28.915 --> 12:30.950
own this many fuzzy garments?

12:30.984 --> 12:32.952
‐ It's only cause I organized it
by fabric.

12:32.986 --> 12:35.588
I did faux fur, flirty florals,

12:35.622 --> 12:37.390
feminine flannels...

12:38.524 --> 12:39.525
‐ You saved it all.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.828
(Rachel shouting in background)
So carefully.

12:41.861 --> 12:43.496
‐ Yeah, everything I could,
anyway.

12:43.529 --> 12:45.231
(Rachel): A little help here,
please!

12:45.265 --> 12:48.134
(knocking on window)
‐ Geez. Hey, Rachel!

12:48.167 --> 12:49.736
Not like that!

12:49.769 --> 12:53.406
Honestly, it's like this girl
has never milked a skunk before.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.176
‐ You're saying all these words
like they make sense.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.445
‐ I gotta go save her
from herself.

12:59.946 --> 13:02.482
Come back safe, okay? Again.

13:03.216 --> 13:04.884
And with Wynonna this time.

13:04.917 --> 13:06.653
(Rachel): I just need
your juice!

13:06.686 --> 13:09.188
(sighs)
‐ Okay.

13:12.558 --> 13:13.660
(Wynonna sighs)

13:13.693 --> 13:15.328
‐ What are you in for?

13:15.361 --> 13:17.263
‐ I splatowed
one of my customers.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.564
I thought she was a Medusa.

13:18.598 --> 13:21.668
‐ 'Cause of how high you were?
‐ No, because she was a Medusa.

13:24.437 --> 13:27.540
‐ If Purgatory's such
a hellhole now, why stay?

13:27.573 --> 13:30.476
‐ Wait... How'd you get around
the problem of the border?

13:31.444 --> 13:32.812
‐ What problem with the border?

13:32.845 --> 13:34.914
‐ Oh, did I not mention that?

13:34.947 --> 13:36.449
(Wynonna sighs)
Okay...

13:36.482 --> 13:38.351
After all the demons
moth‐to‐a‐flamed

13:38.384 --> 13:41.254
the Ghost River Triangle,
some government dickpickles

13:41.287 --> 13:43.489
set up, like,
a quarantine around the place.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.692
‐ Whoa, whoa, whoa,
so, people can't get out now?

13:45.725 --> 13:47.660
‐ Demons can't. Reg peeps can.

13:47.694 --> 13:49.128
‐ Good.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.630
‐ Wait. Not criminals!

13:50.663 --> 13:52.899
There's no way in Herojuana
they'll let you out.

13:52.932 --> 13:55.501
‐ This is a Russian doll
of suckage.

13:55.535 --> 13:58.504
Inside an arbitrary border,
there's a hellmouth,

13:58.538 --> 14:00.173
inside that is a demon
bush party,

14:00.206 --> 14:01.774
inside that is a jail,

14:01.808 --> 14:03.242
and inside that,

14:03.276 --> 14:05.244
I'm at the mercy
of a Dukes of Hazzard reject

14:05.278 --> 14:07.180
who wouldn't know justice
if it splatowed him

14:07.213 --> 14:09.349
in his butter sculpture face.
(knocking)

14:09.382 --> 14:11.451
‐ Ms. Earp? You have a visitor.

14:11.484 --> 14:12.785
‐ Good.

14:12.819 --> 14:14.587
Give me a heads up next time.

14:14.620 --> 14:15.788
‐ You were in the zone.

14:15.822 --> 14:17.790
‐ My client has the right
to a trial.

14:17.824 --> 14:19.525
‐ Your sister will get one.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.260
That's the whole reason
I brought her in,

14:21.294 --> 14:22.795
instead of letting the town
hang her.

14:23.596 --> 14:25.898
‐ I'm issuing a writ
of habeas corpus.

14:25.932 --> 14:26.966
‐ No!

14:26.999 --> 14:29.369
These dickpickles are gonna have
to show us a body.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.771
‐ That is literally
what habeas corpus means.

14:31.804 --> 14:33.806
‐ You two wanna let me know
when you're done slap‐fighting

14:33.840 --> 14:35.675
'cause I've got
a hell of a backlog.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.176
‐ Oh, you've got a backlog?

14:37.210 --> 14:39.412
Buddy, apparently I haven't
pooped in 18 months.

14:39.445 --> 14:41.381
I have a backlog.

14:42.248 --> 14:43.783
‐ Motion to strike that
from the record.

14:43.816 --> 14:45.284
‐ Motion denied.

14:45.318 --> 14:47.353
‐ Nice of you to join us,
Magistrate.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.722
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ Magistrate?

14:50.656 --> 14:52.892
‐ The family member here
would like to register

14:52.925 --> 14:54.660
a judicial complaint,
Your Honor.

14:54.694 --> 14:55.595
‐ Yeah, I don't do those.

14:55.628 --> 14:57.630
I just like the part
where I'm all judgy.

14:57.663 --> 14:59.732
‐ It's regarding the Earp case.

15:04.570 --> 15:05.638
‐ That's her?

15:06.739 --> 15:08.274
That?

15:08.307 --> 15:09.642
‐ That can hear you.

15:09.675 --> 15:12.145
‐ Um, we need to manage
this one carefully.

15:12.178 --> 15:14.414
There was an incident downtown,
and...

15:14.447 --> 15:16.682
people are watching.
‐ Ooh, fun.

15:16.716 --> 15:19.919
‐ Uh, can we not refer
to the attempted execution

15:19.952 --> 15:21.788
of my client as fun?

15:22.488 --> 15:24.657
‐ Can I speak to you
for a moment privately?

15:24.690 --> 15:26.426
In my office?

15:27.560 --> 15:29.562
‐ Cute outfit.

15:31.464 --> 15:32.598
(door closing)

15:32.632 --> 15:34.901
(whispering): Is this our plan?
Is this our entire plan?

15:34.934 --> 15:36.002
‐ No, of course not.

15:36.035 --> 15:38.538
Wynonna, we're gonna prove
you didn't kill Nedley.

15:38.571 --> 15:39.505
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.107

16:45.805 --> 16:47.573
because it's safer that way.

16:47.607 --> 16:50.343
What does that tell you

16:50.776 --> 16:52.578
Please tell me
everyone's okay, Doc.

Wynonna is in jail.

that magnificent old bitch
back to health.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.628
But eventually,
he did a runner on me.

17:08.661 --> 17:09.662
‐ Why?

17:09.695 --> 17:12.498
‐ He was oozing. And he smelled.

17:12.532 --> 17:15.434
Like a teen boy's feet,
coated in blue cheese.

17:15.468 --> 17:16.836
Worse than you!

17:17.470 --> 17:19.238
‐ You paint quite
a picture, Portia.

17:19.272 --> 17:21.374
‐ I tried my best.

17:21.407 --> 17:23.276
But this place was getting real.

17:23.309 --> 17:25.645
And after a few days, he just...

17:25.678 --> 17:27.647
he took off into the woods.

17:28.347 --> 17:30.483
‐ Where the monsters are.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.555
You must come
and attest to that.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.723
‐ Doc, this isn't the world
that you all left.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.525
‐ We must produce Nedley,

17:39.559 --> 17:42.128
either alive or dead,
we must find him.

17:43.329 --> 17:46.098
‐ I can tell you where
the people‐eater is,

17:46.132 --> 17:47.500
it's out at Grizzly Flats.

17:47.533 --> 17:49.602
Maybe you'll find something
to show them.

17:49.635 --> 17:51.637

are like if Wolverine

17:51.671 --> 17:53.339

‐ Yeah.

18:08.888 --> 18:10.389
What if they're all demons?
‐ Exactly,

You think that our jails

18:25.438 --> 18:28.174
are too crowded,
and our courts are too slow?

18:28.207 --> 18:30.643
Think there's nothing to do
in this lame‐ass town?

18:30.676 --> 18:33.479
Think we need a little bit
more junk in our trunks?

18:33.512 --> 18:35.781
‐ Is she asking me?
‐ And as always,

18:35.815 --> 18:37.483

18:37.516 --> 18:39.518

‐ Hey, just be glad
you weren't here

19:30.302 --> 19:33.673
for the Tops‐Off‐Dance‐Off
For Freedom!

19:33.706 --> 19:35.141
Every month or so,

19:35.174 --> 19:37.410
the Magistrate manages
to out‐whackadoo herself.

19:37.443 --> 19:39.211
‐ I don't get it.
What's her endgame?

19:39.245 --> 19:42.148
‐ Ugh, classic bread
and circuses, brah.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.283
Keep the populace fed
and entertained,

19:44.316 --> 19:46.519
and you can get away
with all kinds of devilry.

19:46.552 --> 19:49.121
‐ Yup. Okay, your trash talk
is a little all over the place.

19:49.155 --> 19:51.357
‐ Hey, they set people free
after these contests.

19:51.390 --> 19:52.458
I've seen it.

19:52.491 --> 19:55.361
What if this is the only chance
for us to get out?

19:56.729 --> 19:58.497
‐ Wynonna!

19:58.531 --> 19:59.465
Hi.

20:00.399 --> 20:01.534
‐ Haught.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.172
‐ Thanks for getting her home.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.240
‐ I only did it for me.

20:08.274 --> 20:10.509
‐ Like everything
you've ever done.

20:11.444 --> 20:13.179
‐ It's been a while.

20:14.447 --> 20:16.282
A long while, apparently.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.484
How you holding up?
‐ Peachy.

20:18.517 --> 20:21.120
‐ Hey. I brought a few things
from home.

20:21.153 --> 20:22.521
Is that against the rules?

20:22.555 --> 20:23.556
‐ Uh, I feel like the only rule

20:23.589 --> 20:25.958
is don't tell the Empress
she's got no clothes.

20:26.258 --> 20:28.461
‐ Well she's def
got no panties.

20:29.095 --> 20:31.764
What? She jumped up on a desk.
I couldn't help it.

20:31.797 --> 20:34.100
‐ Is she waxed?
(airhorn blaring)

20:34.133 --> 20:35.534
Fudge!
‐ And that's the first toot

20:35.568 --> 20:38.938
of the Randy Nedley Memorial
Chili Cook‐off For Freedom!

20:38.971 --> 20:41.006
With a lot more toots to follow.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.975
Now get cooking, left‐swipes!

20:43.375 --> 20:46.078
Cook!
‐ Do I put the cheese in first?

20:46.112 --> 20:48.147
Probably, right?
‐ Oh!

20:49.048 --> 20:50.082
‐ Okay.
‐ Okay.

20:50.116 --> 20:51.083
‐ Yup.
‐ Yup.

20:51.117 --> 20:52.585
We're on it. We're on it.

20:54.653 --> 20:57.423
(eerie music)

21:26.786 --> 21:29.021
‐ Ohh...

21:29.421 --> 21:32.391
Oh, sweet honey‐lamb.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.966
(monster growling)

21:43.636 --> 21:46.405
(tense music)

21:50.376 --> 21:52.444
Come closer, now.

21:52.478 --> 21:55.347
It is time we met.

21:55.381 --> 21:56.549
(growling)

21:56.582 --> 21:58.984
(country music)

21:59.985 --> 22:01.987
‐ Woo! You want a t‐shirt?!

22:02.021 --> 22:03.022
You want a t‐shirt?

22:03.055 --> 22:05.357
And you get a t‐shirt! Oh!

22:05.391 --> 22:06.625
In the nads!

22:06.659 --> 22:09.028
Now they're also XXL!

22:09.061 --> 22:10.229
‐ Probably better
not to be Sheriff

22:10.262 --> 22:11.697
while she's got her hands
on that thing.

22:11.730 --> 22:13.365
Imagine the lawsuits?

22:13.399 --> 22:16.101
I never imagined
you giving up the star,

22:16.135 --> 22:17.970
power‐hungry fiend that you are.

22:18.003 --> 22:19.738
‐ I didn't give up.
Cleo showed up,

22:19.772 --> 22:21.640
reincorporated the town,
made herself magistrate,

22:21.674 --> 22:24.443
and elected her own Sheriff.
‐ So nobody stopped her?

22:24.476 --> 22:27.513
‐ Who had time for politics?
I had Rachel, and the homestead,

22:27.546 --> 22:29.181
and people to look for.

22:29.615 --> 22:31.183
And I did look. Hard.

22:31.217 --> 22:32.518
‐ Where'd you look?
Up Bunny Loblaw's‐‐

22:32.551 --> 22:34.253
‐ Don't come at me about it,
okay, Wynonna?

22:34.286 --> 22:36.522
I know I let everybody down.

22:36.555 --> 22:38.123
‐ Nicole, I would never say‐‐

22:38.157 --> 22:40.459
‐ Are you two chatting?
I need those onions, stat!

22:40.492 --> 22:42.261
‐ Yes, chef! Coming.

22:42.294 --> 22:44.930
‐ Okay. Now,
for the pressed seitan.

22:44.964 --> 22:47.366
what?! Who's President Satan?

22:47.399 --> 22:50.169
‐ No. Seitan.
As in vital wheat gluten.

22:50.202 --> 22:51.637
It's the secret
to a hearty vegan chili.

22:51.670 --> 22:53.339
‐ We're making vegan chili?!

22:53.372 --> 22:55.007
‐ Baby, how's she supposed
to win anything

22:55.040 --> 22:56.475
with vegan chili?!

22:57.009 --> 22:58.510
(gasps)

22:58.544 --> 23:01.180
‐ Not today, Satan!

23:01.647 --> 23:02.681
‐ Afternoon, Ms. Haught.

23:02.715 --> 23:04.383
‐ Sheriff Clayborn.

23:05.017 --> 23:06.352
‐ Makes a change to see you
back in town.

23:06.385 --> 23:09.088
I hope that means
there's no hard feelings.

23:09.488 --> 23:11.290
About the election.

23:11.323 --> 23:13.359
‐ I didn't have as much time
to campaign.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.461
Or your other
rumored advantages.

23:16.028 --> 23:18.130
‐ Nice you can afford
a break now, though.

23:18.530 --> 23:19.965
I mean, that is,

23:19.999 --> 23:21.700
if you feel the homestead
is safe with a...

23:21.734 --> 23:23.569
teenage girl on the case.

23:25.004 --> 23:27.139
Good luck with the chili.

23:34.513 --> 23:36.515
‐ Aw, you have your little
worry wrinkle.

23:36.548 --> 23:39.218
‐ There are things, Waverly.
Every night, in those traps.

23:39.251 --> 23:41.520
The monster really wants inside.

23:41.553 --> 23:43.255
‐ You're worried about Rachel.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.058
Why don't you go home?

23:46.091 --> 23:47.526
‐ You sure you don't mind?

23:47.559 --> 23:49.094
‐ No.

23:57.503 --> 23:59.672
‐ I'll give you 20 bucks
for half your bacon.

23:59.705 --> 24:02.107
‐ You don't have 20 bucks.

24:02.608 --> 24:04.376
Wynonna!

24:06.412 --> 24:07.947
(ominous music)

24:07.980 --> 24:09.949
‐ For Randy Nedley.

24:09.982 --> 24:13.118
(gunshots, monster growling)

24:24.596 --> 24:27.099
(growling)

24:28.667 --> 24:30.502
‐ Rachel?!

24:30.536 --> 24:33.639
Valdez?!
‐ Nicole! I'm okay!

24:33.672 --> 24:35.507
‐ Okay. You're okay?

24:35.541 --> 24:37.509
‐ Don't make it more painful
by mommying me.

24:37.543 --> 24:38.911
‐ What happened?

24:38.944 --> 24:40.479
‐ I'm out re‐baiting trap seven,
by the poplars,

24:40.512 --> 24:43.582
and you scared away the skunks
earlier, so I used kombucha.

24:43.615 --> 24:45.284
What? It kills
all kinds of things,

24:45.317 --> 24:47.586
you know, like intestinal
parasites, and...

24:47.619 --> 24:49.054
Ow, ow!

24:49.088 --> 24:50.522
So I'm filling up the trap,

24:50.556 --> 24:53.125
and it runs in,
you know, the big, crusty one.

24:53.158 --> 24:55.661
But then, you know
that old‐timey cowboy dude?

24:55.694 --> 24:56.996
Daddy Blue Eyes?

24:57.029 --> 24:58.330
‐ Doc.
‐ Yeah!

24:58.364 --> 25:00.099
He's on the hill,
and he's yelling at it

25:00.132 --> 25:01.400
to come get him instead.

25:01.433 --> 25:03.902
‐ Did he kill it?
‐ No, but he shot it.

25:03.969 --> 25:06.138
‐ Okay. You are coming inside.

25:06.171 --> 25:08.173
And that is my mommy voice.

25:08.207 --> 25:10.309
(indistinct chattering)

25:10.976 --> 25:12.344
‐ Oh, my God. It's edible.
Try it!

25:12.378 --> 25:14.213
‐ You threw stolen beef
and a can of anchovies

25:14.246 --> 25:16.315
into my vegan masterpiece!

25:16.348 --> 25:17.483
Ahh!

25:17.516 --> 25:18.584
‐ Damn.

25:18.617 --> 25:21.053
‐ I'm gonna shove that thing
up her canned anchovies.

25:21.086 --> 25:23.722
‐ Criminal, take it.

25:23.756 --> 25:25.391
And this.

25:26.191 --> 25:28.060
Criminal chiliheads!

25:28.093 --> 25:31.330
As you all know,
I excel at having opinions.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.465
And I was going to decide
today's winner

25:33.499 --> 25:34.967
all by my lonesome,

25:34.967 --> 25:36.301
but a little voice in my head
was like,

25:36.335 --> 25:38.637
don't be such a greedy
skank's toilet, Cleo!

25:38.670 --> 25:39.905
‐ Cleo?
‐ Toilet?

25:39.938 --> 25:42.674
‐ So I asked the second...

25:42.708 --> 25:45.044
prettiest girl in all
of Purgatory

25:45.077 --> 25:46.178
to come help me out.

25:46.211 --> 25:49.548
So slap your bits together
for your Miss Kidney Bean:

25:49.581 --> 25:51.417
Chrissy Nedley!

25:51.450 --> 25:53.218
(crowd cheers and applauds)

25:56.455 --> 25:59.091
(tense music)

25:59.458 --> 26:02.094
‐ Oh... You weren't kidding.

26:02.127 --> 26:05.097
She really does think
you killed her dad.

26:05.130 --> 26:07.266
Yeah, I don't think
you're gonna win.

26:07.666 --> 26:10.369
‐ I'm gonna turn out the lights
in case it's attracted to them.

26:11.470 --> 26:13.672
(monster roaring)

26:13.705 --> 26:15.441
‐ It's here.

26:15.474 --> 26:18.177
(stomping)

26:18.210 --> 26:20.979
(Doc): Nicole! Let me in!
Let me in!

26:21.013 --> 26:23.282
(Rachel): It's Dr. Mustache,
we have to save him!

26:23.715 --> 26:25.584
(Doc): I'm going out front!

26:26.618 --> 26:28.487
‐ It's gonna break the glass!

26:28.520 --> 26:29.588
(Doc): Open up!

26:29.621 --> 26:31.490
‐ Nicole, you have
to let him in!

26:31.523 --> 26:33.158
(stomping)
Nicole!

26:33.192 --> 26:35.160
(monster roaring)
Nicole!

26:40.399 --> 26:42.534
‐ Wake up!

26:42.568 --> 26:45.204
(monster roaring)
(Doc): Please!

26:47.172 --> 26:48.874
That felt like it took forever.

26:48.907 --> 26:51.110
‐ Yeah, I bet.
‐ Move!

26:52.478 --> 26:55.247
(intense music)

26:57.549 --> 27:00.352
(gunshot, monster roaring)

27:00.385 --> 27:03.322
‐ You carried a bottle
the whole time you were running?

27:03.355 --> 27:05.357
You are goals.
‐ No, he is not goals,

27:05.390 --> 27:08.060
he needs water.
‐ Or maybe he needs...

27:08.093 --> 27:10.095
(both): Don't say kombucha.

27:10.129 --> 27:11.597
‐ Thanks for distracting
the crusty booger beast.

27:11.630 --> 27:14.066
Right, Haught?
‐ Yeah. Thanks, Doc.

27:14.099 --> 27:15.968
‐ Do not let me set here
for more than ten minutes.

27:16.001 --> 27:18.036
I am fixing to return
to the woods.

27:18.070 --> 27:19.404
‐ For what?
‐ To complete the job.

27:19.438 --> 27:22.241
That is a host animal.
‐ For the little puffballs!

27:22.274 --> 27:24.143
I saw it leaking
from the wound.

27:24.176 --> 27:26.612
‐ I believe it has slowed
a little.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.547
‐ Then it's time we strike back.

27:29.948 --> 27:32.217
‐ It might be okay.
(airhorn blaring)

27:32.251 --> 27:33.986
‐ I'll never get used to that.
‐ So...

27:34.019 --> 27:36.188
Clearly some of you
didn't want it bad enough.

27:36.221 --> 27:37.956
Seriously, four of those chilis

27:37.990 --> 27:39.458
was just hot diarrhea
with beans.

27:39.491 --> 27:40.893
‐ Certainly mine.
‐ Ew.

27:40.926 --> 27:43.162
‐ So, thank you for attending

27:43.195 --> 27:45.998
the first Randy Nedley
Memorial Chili Cook‐off.

27:46.031 --> 27:48.033
‐ If you leave off
the "For Freedom", so help me,

27:48.066 --> 27:49.968
I will treat you to an actual
bowl of hot diarrhea.

27:50.002 --> 27:51.203
‐ For Freedom!

27:51.236 --> 27:54.373
My father had a complicated
relationship with this cook‐off.

27:54.406 --> 27:56.575
If he were here today,
he would say‐‐

27:56.608 --> 27:59.144
‐ God, no one cares, Pissy,
who won?!

28:00.145 --> 28:02.447
And today's winner
of our get out‐of‐jail‐free card

28:02.481 --> 28:03.615
goes to...

28:03.649 --> 28:05.317
‐ Please, please,
please, please.

28:05.350 --> 28:07.486
‐ Wynonna Earp!

28:07.519 --> 28:09.955
‐ What?
(crowd whistling)

28:11.490 --> 28:13.458
(squealing)

28:15.060 --> 28:18.463
‐ Winner, winner,
chili dinner! I win!

28:18.497 --> 28:20.966
‐ Glad it was you, Cell‐y!
‐ Listen, you can have the rest

28:20.999 --> 28:22.935
of my chili if you want.
‐ Ah, I'm good.

28:23.969 --> 28:25.537
‐ What?

28:25.571 --> 28:27.005
‐ Ah...

28:28.106 --> 28:30.375
‐ No way, right?
‐ Okay!

28:30.409 --> 28:31.510
Bye!

28:32.144 --> 28:35.247
Pound it. No? No?
(Waverly gags)

28:35.280 --> 28:38.217
‐ It tastes
like peppermint butt.

28:38.250 --> 28:39.585
‐ Hey, hey!
‐ So why?

28:39.618 --> 28:42.120
‐ Unhand your Chili Queen!

28:43.655 --> 28:45.490
‐ That's why.

28:46.959 --> 28:49.261
‐ Where are those keys?

28:49.661 --> 28:51.163
‐ To my new car?

28:51.196 --> 28:53.532
Wow, this contest
has everything!

28:53.565 --> 28:56.134
‐ Holt, or Sheriff Clayborn,

28:56.168 --> 28:58.103
doesn't like it when I drive
department vehicles,

28:58.136 --> 29:00.239
but he can have
a big old gag of my gavel.

29:00.272 --> 29:02.708
‐ Did you forget
the "freedom" part?

29:02.741 --> 29:04.376
‐ Yeah, not 'til you get
to the border.

29:04.409 --> 29:06.345
‐ I'm not leaving town.
‐ Don't worry,

29:06.378 --> 29:07.212
I can get you out.

29:07.246 --> 29:08.714
I know people.
‐ No, I mean, I won't.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.382
‐ Do you know how many
Purgatorians

29:10.415 --> 29:12.517
would have murdered
for this prize?

29:12.551 --> 29:14.453
(gasps)
Oh, weird...

29:14.486 --> 29:17.055
I just realized that that's
exactly what you did!

29:19.358 --> 29:21.526
‐ You acted like you knew
who I was.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.195
When we first met.

29:23.228 --> 29:25.063
But you're not a Revenant.

29:25.697 --> 29:28.567
And if you were really powerful,
you'd just kill me.

29:31.637 --> 29:33.238
(gasps)
‐ Yay!

29:34.039 --> 29:35.173
Keys!

29:35.207 --> 29:36.541
‐ I wish I knew
what we were up against,

29:36.575 --> 29:38.744
so we could prep a silver
bullet or a wooden stake.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.912
Sorry, Doc.
‐ Understood.

29:40.946 --> 29:42.681
‐ Okay, don't yell at me,
but...

29:42.714 --> 29:45.117
the creature did make
a Chewbacca howl

29:45.150 --> 29:46.351
when it stepped in the puddle
of kombucha.

29:46.385 --> 29:48.553
‐ For the last time,
home brewed mold juice

29:48.587 --> 29:50.255
will not defeat pure evil.

29:50.289 --> 29:51.356
‐ It smelled like pure evil.

29:51.390 --> 29:54.626
When it was leaking?
Like blue cheese and boy feet.

29:54.660 --> 29:57.062
‐ Did you hear someone say that?

29:57.095 --> 29:59.398
‐ It dealt it.
I simply smelt it.

29:59.431 --> 30:02.401
‐ Look, I am not suggesting
we refrain from hunting it...

30:02.434 --> 30:03.635
‐ Like hell I would.

30:03.669 --> 30:05.971
‐ ...but I looked into its eyes
and I'm remain unconvinced

30:06.004 --> 30:07.239
it is our enemy.

30:07.272 --> 30:09.241
‐ This thing wants to take
Waverly's home,

30:09.274 --> 30:11.543
and our ability
to think of anything else.

30:12.210 --> 30:13.945
I found this in the trap,

30:13.979 --> 30:15.414
Last year when you guys were...

30:15.447 --> 30:17.249
‐ Gone for too long.

30:18.016 --> 30:19.551
‐ At first I thought
it was irrelevant,

30:19.584 --> 30:21.486
but then I figured it out.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.121
It's a Hawaiian shirt, Doc.

30:23.155 --> 30:25.557
It's... It's Nedley's shirt.

30:27.025 --> 30:28.527
That thing killed him,

30:28.560 --> 30:30.562
and now we need to kill it.

30:31.296 --> 30:33.332
‐ The ballpuffers are parasites,

30:33.365 --> 30:35.600
and they took over something.

30:35.634 --> 30:37.536
Someone.

30:38.303 --> 30:41.606
Someone that always comes back
to you, Nicole.

30:41.640 --> 30:42.974
‐ No.

30:43.008 --> 30:45.410
‐ What if the ogre
didn't eat Nedley?

30:45.444 --> 30:48.046
What if the ogre...
‐ ...is Nedley?

30:48.080 --> 30:50.048
(tense music)

30:52.150 --> 30:54.019
‐ People will find out...

30:54.052 --> 30:57.222
about the contest, about you
not keeping your word.

30:57.255 --> 30:59.958
‐ One, how are they gonna
find out?

31:00.459 --> 31:03.995
And two, what does an Earp know
about keeping their word, huh?

31:04.029 --> 31:05.964
That is priceless.

31:05.997 --> 31:07.399
You are hilare.

31:07.432 --> 31:09.067
‐ So this is personal.

31:11.036 --> 31:13.538
(grunting)

31:15.073 --> 31:17.008
(Wynonna groaning)

31:18.210 --> 31:19.511
‐ No.

31:19.544 --> 31:21.012
See this...

31:21.046 --> 31:25.016
This is hereditary,
daughter of Earps.

31:25.584 --> 31:27.619
(Cleo laughing)

31:27.652 --> 31:29.955
Besides, we have to keep

31:29.988 --> 31:32.124
feeding something
to this monster,

31:32.157 --> 31:34.726
whatever it is,
to keep it out of town.

31:34.760 --> 31:36.495
See, Sheriff Holt and I?

31:36.528 --> 31:38.530
We know what it takes

31:38.563 --> 31:41.066
to get dirty jobs done.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.502
And if that dirty job...

31:45.370 --> 31:47.406
happens to be you?

31:48.640 --> 31:50.108
Bonus.

31:50.509 --> 31:52.577
Now scream.
‐ Argh!

31:53.645 --> 31:55.580
(quietly): Eat my vegan seitan.

31:55.614 --> 31:57.983
(sighs)
‐ See, they lied.

31:58.016 --> 31:59.418
You're not even fun.

32:00.452 --> 32:02.487
(screaming)

32:03.989 --> 32:05.690
Beastie boy!

32:05.724 --> 32:08.093
Come and get it!

32:11.430 --> 32:12.564
‐ Where are you going?

32:12.597 --> 32:14.633
‐ Oh, to sit in my car.

32:14.666 --> 32:16.301
Take a few pics!

32:16.334 --> 32:19.538
Maybe buff my muff,
if the mood strikes.

32:19.571 --> 32:21.339
‐ You are so weird.

32:24.209 --> 32:25.510
‐ Previews are over.

32:25.544 --> 32:27.412
Looks like the creature feature
is starting.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.448
‐ Get away from her,
skank toilet!

32:29.481 --> 32:30.515
‐ Ahh!

32:30.549 --> 32:32.417
‐ For the record, I don't
believe in skank shaming,

32:32.451 --> 32:33.618
but you said it first.

32:36.154 --> 32:38.056
Sis, you okay?

32:38.089 --> 32:39.591
‐ We need a knife or scissors.

32:39.624 --> 32:41.560
‐ I have... teeth?

32:42.160 --> 32:44.262
‐ Ugh! She's got a weapon!

32:45.063 --> 32:46.898
‐ Friggin' skanks always do.

32:46.932 --> 32:48.467
Wait, I gotta stop saying that.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.368
Okay, stay there!

32:55.507 --> 32:57.943
No, no, no!

32:57.976 --> 32:59.344
(Cleo screaming)

32:59.978 --> 33:01.313
(growling)

33:01.346 --> 33:04.216
(whimpering)

33:08.520 --> 33:10.422
(grunting)

33:10.455 --> 33:11.556
(growling)

33:11.590 --> 33:13.124
‐ Waverly!

33:15.260 --> 33:16.561
Waverly!

33:17.662 --> 33:19.464
‐ Hold your fire!
‐ It's Nedley!

33:22.300 --> 33:23.668
Doc, flank him on the back!

33:23.702 --> 33:26.204
Waverly, find your position!

33:27.539 --> 33:30.442
(tense music)

33:33.144 --> 33:35.180

33:36.281 --> 33:38.216

What did I do?

34:41.613 --> 34:43.915
‐ You survived, Nedley.

34:43.949 --> 34:45.050
That's what you did.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.985
You made it home.

34:49.387 --> 34:50.455
‐ Fuck yeah.

34:58.296 --> 35:01.600
‐ Nedley, I'm not coming
any closer

35:01.633 --> 35:03.101
until you put this on.

35:04.336 --> 35:06.137
There's been enough crime today.

35:06.171 --> 35:08.006
(breathing heavily)

35:08.039 --> 35:09.507
‐ Hey.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.579
‐ Nicole, what's going on?
‐ I...

35:14.613 --> 35:17.415
‐ You were not in possession
of your own faculties.

35:19.985 --> 35:21.553
‐ Why do I taste skunk?

35:21.586 --> 35:23.254
‐ That may be me.

35:24.623 --> 35:27.092
‐ That's some intense, brother.

35:31.396 --> 35:33.465
(soft music)

35:43.441 --> 35:44.509
‐ Dad.
‐ Chrissy!

35:44.542 --> 35:46.444
‐ Oh, my God. Dad!

35:47.212 --> 35:50.415
(crying)
‐ Shh, shh.

35:54.219 --> 35:56.221
‐ They told me you were dead.

35:56.955 --> 36:00.291
‐ This stubborn mule? Not yet.

36:01.559 --> 36:04.262
‐ Where were you? What happened?

36:04.295 --> 36:05.463
‐ I really don't remember.

36:05.497 --> 36:08.700
‐ Ah, might be for the best.
‐ Might be?

36:08.733 --> 36:11.136
‐ Look, um, we think
he'll be fine.

36:11.169 --> 36:14.105
But just for fun, maybe keep him
away from small game.

36:17.242 --> 36:19.477
‐ Wynonna. I don't even
know what to say.

36:19.511 --> 36:20.645
(Wynonna): I know.

36:21.346 --> 36:23.448
‐ It's just,
since the evacuation, I...

36:23.481 --> 36:26.351
this place...
it got to me and I...

36:26.384 --> 36:28.620
‐ Needed us and got hurt
when we weren't here?

36:30.655 --> 36:33.258
‐ Yeah.
‐ It won't happen again.

36:36.327 --> 36:37.595
Hey, you.

36:41.499 --> 36:43.368
It's good to have you back.

36:53.411 --> 36:54.546
‐ Nicole.

36:56.047 --> 36:57.449
‐ You should get Chrissy
out of here.

36:57.482 --> 36:59.184
While you still can.

37:10.428 --> 37:12.497
‐ You did the chili cook‐off
without me?

37:12.530 --> 37:15.200
(laughing)
‐ Dad...

37:15.700 --> 37:18.303
(electronic music)

37:20.638 --> 37:24.175
‐ Here I thought all my flirting
was getting me nowhere.

37:24.976 --> 37:27.011
‐ There is more
where that came from.

37:27.045 --> 37:30.648
‐ That would get my slacks off
in a snap.

37:30.682 --> 37:32.584
‐ 'Cause that would be
a challenge.

37:33.151 --> 37:35.553
‐ I paid for that truck,
and its contents,

37:35.587 --> 37:36.654
and I'll be french‐fried

37:36.688 --> 37:39.290
if you're going to sell my own
property back to me.

37:39.324 --> 37:42.260
‐ Except I know where it is
and you do not.

37:42.293 --> 37:44.963
But I suppose I could sell
said contents

37:44.996 --> 37:46.397
to the human bar in town...

37:46.431 --> 37:49.234
‐ Let's not get off
on the wrong foot.

37:50.335 --> 37:53.004
‐ I also suggest
that you acquire

37:53.037 --> 37:56.107
protection for your next order
and that would be,

37:56.141 --> 37:58.143
well, yours truly.

37:58.176 --> 38:00.378
An experienced hand
with local knowledge,

38:00.411 --> 38:05.283
who can then safely convey
said truck right to your...

38:05.316 --> 38:07.152
back door.

38:07.719 --> 38:10.255
‐ What would you require
in return?

38:11.222 --> 38:14.425
Something to quench
that vampiric appetite?

38:15.160 --> 38:17.128
When was the last time you fed?

38:17.162 --> 38:19.164
‐ My hunger...

38:19.197 --> 38:20.465
is none of your concern.

38:20.498 --> 38:24.135
What I require
is something more... tangible.

38:24.169 --> 38:26.137
A future favor.

38:26.671 --> 38:28.973
And two thousand a load.

38:29.007 --> 38:31.276
(chuckling)
‐ That's highway robbery.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.411
‐ Precisely.
And at a reasonable cost.

38:33.444 --> 38:36.614
But I assure you,
I am the best.

38:37.315 --> 38:38.616
‐ Mm‐hmm...

38:44.055 --> 38:45.657
(electronic music continues)

38:47.158 --> 38:48.593
‐ You smell like heaven.

38:48.626 --> 38:50.228
‐ I know.

38:59.003 --> 39:04.108
♪ If you could love
me completely ♪

39:06.711 --> 39:11.182
♪ If you could show me
a sign ♪

39:13.718 --> 39:17.388
‐ Having trouble remembering
where you like these lips.

39:17.422 --> 39:20.091
‐ You seem to be figuring
it out.

39:21.359 --> 39:24.329
‐ You know, the garden tried
to fool me.

39:25.396 --> 39:27.432
With a fake you.

39:27.465 --> 39:29.033
‐ You didn't...

39:29.067 --> 39:31.703
‐ No. Not even close.

39:31.736 --> 39:34.372
But I would've known
in a second.

39:35.306 --> 39:37.308
I know every curve...

39:39.043 --> 39:40.712
every sigh...

39:41.713 --> 39:43.648
every taste...

39:44.682 --> 39:46.317
(door closing)

39:48.419 --> 39:51.623
Wynonna, her midnight snack,
and the pantry door.

39:52.223 --> 39:55.059
She never met a thing
she couldn't slam.

39:56.594 --> 39:59.097
‐ Yeah. I guess I'd forgotten.

40:00.164 --> 40:01.699
‐ I love you, Nicole Haught.

40:01.733 --> 40:05.403
And I can't wait for the rest
of our lives to unfold.

40:10.341 --> 40:13.077
Can you tell me about
your year and a half?

40:14.512 --> 40:17.315
‐ I'm sorry,
I'm just... distracted.

40:17.348 --> 40:19.317
I gotta go check those traps.

40:19.350 --> 40:20.551
‐ Oh.

40:20.585 --> 40:23.087
Yeah. Okay. Uh...

40:23.121 --> 40:25.256
Can I come with you?

40:26.057 --> 40:27.525
‐ Always.

40:27.558 --> 40:30.395
(soft music)

40:40.305 --> 40:43.408
‐ Expected date of return?
‐ Never.

40:43.441 --> 40:46.244
My Dad's birthday is in August.
Might surprise him.

40:46.277 --> 40:48.313
‐ I have to get my supervisor.

40:50.148 --> 40:52.550
(radio turns on)

40:52.583 --> 40:54.619
(rock music plays)

40:59.090 --> 41:01.059
(Man): You're cleared to go.

41:03.194 --> 41:05.196
(whispering): They're back.

41:20.011 --> 41:23.214
‐ I'll move out to the barn,
now that everyone's ba

41:24.082 --> 41:26.150
Which is good.
‐ Take the bed.

41:26.551 --> 41:28.353
You've earned it, kid.

41:28.386 --> 41:30.054
Besides...

41:31.055 --> 41:33.124
I'm better in the cold.

41:34.125 --> 41:36.394
‐ Okay, Jon Snow in a B cup.

41:37.061 --> 41:39.230
And I'm not a kid, Wynonna.

41:41.499 --> 41:43.368
‐ Why'd you leave Monument?

41:44.268 --> 41:47.171
‐ When you're a person
who's gone through some stuff,

41:47.205 --> 41:49.374
and you see somebody else,
who's a good person,

41:49.407 --> 41:51.209
also going through some stuff...

41:52.477 --> 41:54.145
‐ How bad is Nicole?

41:55.046 --> 41:58.282
‐ She was alone
for a really long time.

42:01.019 --> 42:02.954
‐ Well, thanks for taking care
of my friend,

42:02.987 --> 42:04.822
Rachel Valdez.

42:05.156 --> 42:08.259
‐ Thank you for noticing,
Wynonna Earp.

42:08.292 --> 42:10.261
Oh, the Earp heir.

42:16.868 --> 42:18.870
‐ Listen. My bed, yeah.

42:18.903 --> 42:21.005
My leather pants, no.

42:21.039 --> 42:22.273
‐ Pfft, please.

42:22.306 --> 42:25.309
I wouldn't be seen wearing these
in front of the skunks I milk.

42:27.578 --> 42:30.381
Your fringed leather jacket,
though...

42:31.315 --> 42:33.951
‐ Don't push your luck,
Smalldez.

42:35.053 --> 42:37.388
Good night.
‐ Good night, Wynonna.

42:39.323 --> 42:41.125
(sighing)

42:45.430 --> 42:48.199
‐ Hello, chaps!
‐ Hands up.

42:48.232 --> 42:51.169
‐ Like I said:
so good to be home.

42:52.837 --> 42:56.007
Subtitling: difuze
