WEBVTT

00:03.504 --> 00:04.436
Listen, we got a problem.

00:04.438 --> 00:06.805
"Vigilante cop
abuses power"?

00:06.807 --> 00:08.173
Dwayne Pride is dangerous,

00:08.175 --> 00:09.474
and he needs to be
held accountable.

00:09.476 --> 00:11.476
<i>It's a</i>
<i>coordinated attack, Dwayne,</i>

00:11.478 --> 00:13.212
<i>and you're the target.</i>

00:13.214 --> 00:15.347
Suspect's name
is Max Burris,

00:15.349 --> 00:17.816
former intelligence operative
out of Virginia.

00:17.818 --> 00:20.285
I'm gonna find out
who he answers to

00:20.287 --> 00:21.687
and why he's been targeting me.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.589
<i>You help us find this man,</i>

00:23.591 --> 00:27.359
and I will hand you the
biggest story of your career

00:27.361 --> 00:28.827
about a conspiracy
to take me down

00:28.829 --> 00:30.829
that goes all the way
to Washington.

00:30.831 --> 00:32.731
Since I have
it on good authority

00:32.732 --> 00:34.299
that you've got no evidence
Mr. Burris committed murder,

00:34.301 --> 00:35.834
<i>it seems that he's free to go.</i>

00:35.836 --> 00:38.070
That article exposes you

00:38.072 --> 00:41.039
and the DOJ to any number
of civil lawsuits.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.774
Why are you doing this, Karen?

00:42.776 --> 00:46.612
It's not me, Dwayne, or my boss,
not even his boss.

00:46.614 --> 00:50.782

a good one, fast.

Listen, uh, I'm kind of
in a rush here.

01:31.884 --> 01:33.182
I need to ask you
for a favor.

01:33.183 --> 01:35.884
You kidding? Whatever
you need, Dwayne. I owe you.

01:35.886 --> 01:37.919
And don't worry, I don't
believe none of that crap

01:37.921 --> 01:40.555

saying about you. It's all crap.

01:40.557 --> 01:42.324
Actually, not-not
all of it,

01:42.326 --> 01:45.327
but that's not the point.
State bar reinstated you,

01:45.329 --> 01:47.128
means you can practice law
again, right?

01:47.130 --> 01:49.064
Ain't nobody
been knocking on my door.

01:49.066 --> 01:50.465
Been a bit of a dry spell

01:50.467 --> 01:52.901
since that corporate firm
railroaded me,

01:52.903 --> 01:54.703
bribed the jury.

01:54.705 --> 01:56.671
- Cheers.
- H-H-Hang on now.

01:56.673 --> 01:59.007
I'm afraid I need
you sober for this.

01:59.009 --> 02:02.844
Long story, but the bottom
line is I'm being set up.

02:03.933 --> 02:05.433
I just turned in
my shield,

02:05.435 --> 02:08.735
then I get a tip
the FBI's coming to arrest me

02:08.738 --> 02:11.238
so that I don't take off before
the grand jury indictment.

02:11.240 --> 02:14.141
What do you mean "indictment"?
On what charges? When?

02:14.143 --> 02:16.811
All the matters is that
I'm being railroaded, too,

02:16.813 --> 02:18.979
and the only way I can
find out who's behind it

02:18.981 --> 02:21.515
is if you make sure
I don't get indicted.

02:21.517 --> 02:24.084
I'm telling you, Fred,

02:24.086 --> 02:26.353
you can do this, I know it.

02:26.355 --> 02:27.284
Listen to me.

02:27.285 --> 02:29.351
This could be the chance
that you've been waiting for.

02:29.353 --> 02:31.553
The one that could
keep me out of jail

02:31.555 --> 02:32.921
and get you back
on your feet.

02:32.923 --> 02:34.089
What do you say?

02:34.091 --> 02:35.991
Last thing I ever want
to do in life is

02:35.993 --> 02:39.594
let you down, Dwayne, but...

02:39.596 --> 02:41.763
H-How much time
do I have to decide?

02:45.102 --> 02:48.270

Last night at the bar.

03:18.469 --> 03:20.235
They let him have
one phone call this morning

03:20.237 --> 03:22.237
before the grand jury convened.

03:22.239 --> 03:23.705
The grand jury's not
wasting any time

03:23.707 --> 03:25.540
It's not the jury
that's in a rush.

03:25.542 --> 03:28.009
It's whoever's trying to destroy
Pride's good name.

03:28.011 --> 03:29.678
We gotta figure out who's
pulling the strings here.

03:29.680 --> 03:32.314
And what trying to destroy Pride
has to do with all this.

03:32.316 --> 03:34.649
What? But I thought you were
close to getting the guy

03:34.651 --> 03:36.618
responsible for the
media leaks on Pride.

03:36.620 --> 03:37.752
Well, we were,

03:37.754 --> 03:39.421
but apparently
this Max Burris

03:39.423 --> 03:40.822
has friends
in high places.

03:40.824 --> 03:42.357
Friends no doubt
connected to

03:42.359 --> 03:44.626
whoever Pride's enemies are
in D.C.

03:44.628 --> 03:45.927
'cause the Feds released them.

03:45.929 --> 03:47.629
Has Sebastian still got
his eye on Burris?

03:47.631 --> 03:49.231
He just called in.
Said Burris is still

03:49.233 --> 03:50.499
at the law firm
that freed him.

03:50.501 --> 03:52.334
Ten bucks says
that law firm is

03:52.336 --> 03:54.369
deep inside
the D.C. baddie's pocket.

03:54.371 --> 03:55.971
No doubt they're trying
to spirit Burris out of town

03:55.973 --> 03:57.739
before we can get our hands
on him again.

03:57.741 --> 03:58.940
Too bad we
don't have enough evidence

03:58.942 --> 04:00.742
to prove he killed
the Navy sailor

04:00.744 --> 04:03.545
after he made her
release the files on Pride.

04:03.547 --> 04:04.846
Right.

04:04.848 --> 04:06.481
'Cause if we did,

04:06.483 --> 04:08.416
his federal friends
couldn't protect him from us,

04:08.418 --> 04:10.986
because murder is
a <i>state</i> charge.

04:10.988 --> 04:12.587
- Exactly.
- All right, then, Patton.

04:12.589 --> 04:14.523
You and Sebastian need
to find proof.

04:14.525 --> 04:17.091
Talk to the reporter
Burris leaked it all to.

04:17.094 --> 04:18.726
Get his digital fingerprint
on the funding.

04:18.728 --> 04:20.862
All we need is probable
cause to arrest.

04:20.863 --> 04:23.064
Soon as we relieve Sebastian,

04:23.066 --> 04:25.300
I'll send him to the motel
Burris stayed at,

04:25.302 --> 04:26.935
see if he can find
any trace evidence.

04:26.937 --> 04:27.936
Gregorio, you're with me.

04:27.938 --> 04:28.970
Where are we going?

04:28.972 --> 04:30.071
Well, they gotta
move Burris

04:30.073 --> 04:31.172
sooner than later,

04:31.174 --> 04:32.440
and when they do,
I want to be there,

04:32.442 --> 04:34.175
hopefully with proof
to grab him.

04:34.177 --> 04:36.878
Uh, what about Dwayne?

04:38.582 --> 04:41.683
I still don't understand
how the judge allowed

04:41.685 --> 04:44.185
all that evidence
to be presented.

04:44.187 --> 04:47.556
It made you look like you're
a danger to the community.

04:47.558 --> 04:48.857
Pretty sure that's
their plan.

04:48.859 --> 04:50.292
Still,

04:50.294 --> 04:52.160
I-I let you down
in there.

04:52.162 --> 04:53.495
I'm sorry, Dwayne.

04:53.497 --> 04:56.932
I knew I was not ready
to go up against...

04:56.934 --> 04:58.400
It's not your fault, Newman.

04:58.402 --> 05:00.235
The grand jury was gonna
hold me over for trial

05:00.237 --> 05:01.970
no matter who was
defending me.

05:01.972 --> 05:05.307
They'll probably
set bail high.

05:05.309 --> 05:09.077
But maybe if I can petition
to reduce bail at this...

05:11.715 --> 05:12.781
Do you know who I am?

05:12.783 --> 05:14.916
Name's Eric Barlow.

05:14.918 --> 05:16.551
I am the associate
attorney general.

05:16.553 --> 05:20.088
<i>The</i> associate
attorney general?

05:20.090 --> 05:23.625
Long way from D.C.
What brings you here?

05:23.627 --> 05:25.594
You do, Agent Pride.

05:25.596 --> 05:26.661
I've been keeping
an eye on you

05:26.663 --> 05:27.662
for quite some time now.

05:27.664 --> 05:29.764
Is that a fact?

05:29.766 --> 05:30.832
It's not a good fact.

05:30.834 --> 05:32.534
Anybody gets
on my radar,

05:32.536 --> 05:34.903
usually doesn't bode well.

05:34.905 --> 05:38.006
With that said, I'm gonna
offer you a deal.

05:38.008 --> 05:39.307
It's a one-time-only offer,

05:39.309 --> 05:41.543
so I would take it
seriously if I were you.

05:41.545 --> 05:42.777
I'm listening.

05:42.779 --> 05:45.447
It's not just
the media environment

05:45.449 --> 05:47.349
that's not on your
side these days.

05:47.351 --> 05:49.217
Uh, public attitude
against law enforcement

05:49.219 --> 05:50.418
crossing the line...

05:50.420 --> 05:51.620
I didn't cross the line.

05:51.622 --> 05:53.254
Grand jury says otherwise.

05:53.256 --> 05:55.991
So will a trial
jury, trust me.

05:55.993 --> 05:57.892
Convicted on all charges,

05:57.894 --> 06:00.629
20 years?
Maybe more.

06:00.631 --> 06:04.766
Or... you can quit NCIS.

06:04.768 --> 06:07.068
Retire. Play piano at that
little bar of yours.

06:07.070 --> 06:08.670
Enjoy what's left
of your life.

06:10.140 --> 06:11.539
He keeps his pension?

06:11.541 --> 06:14.242
Sure. Why not?

06:14.244 --> 06:16.444
We accept.
No, we don't.

06:16.446 --> 06:17.846
- But...
- Like I said,

06:17.848 --> 06:19.314
I'm only offering
this once.

06:19.316 --> 06:22.751
Then I'll only have
to turn it down once.

06:23.887 --> 06:25.987
Either way works for me.

06:28.358 --> 06:31.459
Remand him into custody.

06:31.461 --> 06:33.028
What's this?

06:35.132 --> 06:37.532
Huh.

06:39.002 --> 06:40.702
Lucky you.

06:40.704 --> 06:42.937
Looks like you just made bail.

06:47.277 --> 06:50.812
<i>You didn't have</i>
<i>to do that, Loretta.</i>

06:50.814 --> 06:52.414
The hell I didn't.

06:52.416 --> 06:54.416
I wasn't gonna let you
rot in jail, Dwayne.

06:54.418 --> 06:55.418
Wasn't gonna rot.

06:55.477 --> 06:58.019
Look, before you get
all judgy on me

06:58.021 --> 06:59.788
and tell me it was
too much money, it wasn't.

06:59.790 --> 07:02.624
Ten percent on a hundred grand.

07:02.626 --> 07:04.092
$10,000?
That's it?

07:04.094 --> 07:05.527
Yeah. I thought I was
gonna have to

07:05.529 --> 07:08.496
mortgage the house,
borrow against my 401K,

07:08.498 --> 07:11.166
considering everything
they were charging you with.

07:11.168 --> 07:13.334
Well, that doesn't
make sense.

07:13.336 --> 07:15.136
It doesn't make sense
the he didn't seem

07:15.138 --> 07:17.439
to mind my getting out, either.

07:18.608 --> 07:20.075
Who is he?

07:20.077 --> 07:23.378
Associate Attorney
General Barlow.

07:23.380 --> 07:25.847
And if I'm right,
he's the D.C. guy

07:25.849 --> 07:27.415
who's been after me
all year.

07:27.417 --> 07:29.350
He seems familiar.

07:29.352 --> 07:31.419
Just can't quite put
my finger on it, though.

07:31.421 --> 07:32.921
You sure?

07:32.923 --> 07:35.356
What I'm sure of is that
he's sure of himself.

07:35.358 --> 07:36.825
Which means whatever
he's got planned,

07:36.827 --> 07:38.526
he doesn't think
I can stop him.

07:38.528 --> 07:40.628
Wait...

07:42.899 --> 07:44.332
I gotta go, okay?

07:44.334 --> 07:46.167
- But thank you for bailing me out.
- No, no, no, wait, Dwayne.

07:46.169 --> 07:47.402
Ooh, and do me a favor.

07:47.404 --> 07:48.837
Tell Lasalle
to stand down.

07:48.839 --> 07:50.004
All right?
Tell him that's an order.

07:50.006 --> 07:51.072
I don't want anyone else

07:51.074 --> 07:52.707
getting caught up
in this, too.

07:52.709 --> 07:54.209
Dwayne, wait.
What are you gonna do?

07:54.211 --> 07:56.978
Tell me you're not
going to go rogue again.

08:04.187 --> 08:05.887
All right, thanks
for calling.

08:05.889 --> 08:07.822
I promise to keep
an eye on him.

08:07.824 --> 08:09.591
Miss Loretta thinks
King's got something

08:09.593 --> 08:11.793
up his sleeve-- wants
to keep us out of it.

08:11.795 --> 08:13.428
- Fat chance.
- Yeah, exactly.

08:13.430 --> 08:14.729
Still, the sooner

08:14.731 --> 08:16.397
we can figure out what
this is all about,

08:16.399 --> 08:17.899
the sooner we can keep King

08:17.901 --> 08:19.434
from making things
worse for himself.

08:19.436 --> 08:21.603
Well, I don't mean to be
a Debbie Downer,

08:21.605 --> 08:22.937
but if AAG's really
behind this,

08:22.939 --> 08:25.673
chances of success aren't good.
Yeah.

08:25.675 --> 08:28.510
But if we can get Burris
to flip on AAG,

08:28.512 --> 08:30.011
we'll have him dead to rights.

08:30.013 --> 08:31.613
Only if we can
connect him to the murder.

08:31.615 --> 08:33.481
We need leverage first.

08:33.482 --> 08:35.116
Which might be a problem,

08:35.118 --> 08:36.885
because there he is right now--
he's leaving.

08:36.886 --> 08:38.153
I wonder why they're

08:38.155 --> 08:40.121
letting him leave now.

08:40.123 --> 08:41.789
What do we do?

08:41.792 --> 08:43.525
I guess we follow him,

08:43.527 --> 08:46.161
don't let him get away,
and worry about leverage later.

09:07.751 --> 09:08.817
You see that?

09:10.287 --> 09:11.853
Looks like a hit.

09:27.904 --> 09:29.370
Get down! Get down!

09:43.587 --> 09:44.853
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

09:44.855 --> 09:45.887
Idiot, we're not
gonna shoot you.

09:45.889 --> 09:46.988
We just saved you.
Get out!

09:46.990 --> 09:49.331
Come on, let's go
before they kill us all.

10:02.267 --> 10:03.766
<i>Who hired you to kill</i>

10:03.768 --> 10:05.401
<i>Petty Officer Bowers</i>

10:05.403 --> 10:07.337
and to destroy Agent Pride?

10:07.339 --> 10:08.771
I don't know what
you're talking about.

10:08.773 --> 10:10.121
Stow it, Burris.
You know we can link you

10:10.122 --> 10:12.386
to the Intel leak against Pride,
we've already proven that.

10:12.387 --> 10:14.053
That's old news.
My attorney already got me off.

10:14.055 --> 10:15.922
Except for now,
more than likely,

10:15.924 --> 10:17.924
his law firm's trying
to off you.

10:17.926 --> 10:20.159
And if so,
they'll try again, too.

10:20.161 --> 10:21.728
You know they will.

10:21.730 --> 10:23.663
They consider you
loose ends--

10:23.665 --> 10:25.264
ones that need tying up
so you don't tell us

10:25.266 --> 10:26.866
who's behind it all
and why.

10:26.868 --> 10:28.101
Which you need to do

10:28.103 --> 10:29.635
if you want to avoid
the needle.

10:29.637 --> 10:31.370
Oh, wait.

10:31.372 --> 10:33.439
First off, you guys don't have
jack on me for murder.

10:33.441 --> 10:35.074
If you did, you would have
arrested me already.

10:35.076 --> 10:37.076
And second,
I didn't kill her.

10:37.078 --> 10:40.346
All right, then, who did?

10:41.449 --> 10:44.484
One of the guys that just tried
to kill me, actually.

10:47.819 --> 10:48.988
His name's Lonzo.

10:48.990 --> 10:50.790
- "Lonzo" what?
- I don't know.

10:50.792 --> 10:52.458
But I do know
he's gonna come after me again,

10:52.460 --> 10:54.560
which leads me back to
what are you offering?

10:54.562 --> 10:58.197
Well, if it proves out you
didn't pull the trigger,

10:58.199 --> 11:01.534
maybe, uh, accessory to murder,
ten to 15 years.

11:03.171 --> 11:05.938
Are you kidding me?
I won't make it a day in prison.

11:05.940 --> 11:07.340
You guys really don't know
who you're dealing with here.

11:07.342 --> 11:09.208
These people, they have
connections everywhere.

11:09.210 --> 11:12.111
Then tell us who they are
so we can protect you.

11:12.113 --> 11:14.113
I won't make it across the
street before they take me out.

11:14.115 --> 11:15.047
Which means, for you

11:15.049 --> 11:16.949
to have a chance to live,

11:16.951 --> 11:18.885
you need to tell us
who you're working for,

11:18.887 --> 11:20.153
and help us stop

11:20.155 --> 11:22.755
whatever they got planned.

11:31.815 --> 11:33.848
Captain Estes, what
are you doing here?

11:33.849 --> 11:36.517
Wondering what the hell's
going on, that's what.

11:36.519 --> 11:38.385
Has anybody heard from Pride
since he got arrested?

11:38.387 --> 11:40.354
Only that Doc Wade
bailed him out.

11:40.356 --> 11:42.356
I can't believe all the crap
they're putting him through.

11:42.358 --> 11:43.791
Is he okay? Where is he?

11:43.793 --> 11:46.059
Apparently, staying
in the room above his bar,

11:46.061 --> 11:48.262
and we don't know how he is,
'cause he's not telling us.

11:48.264 --> 11:49.730
Apparently,
trying to protect us.

11:49.732 --> 11:51.131
What does that mean?

11:51.133 --> 11:52.099
- What is he doing?
- We don't know.

11:52.101 --> 11:53.467
But what we do
know is we need

11:53.469 --> 11:54.768
to figure this out fast
before he tries

11:54.770 --> 11:56.637
to figure it out himself.
- Yeah.

11:56.639 --> 11:58.772
Yeah, that's what worries me.
Yeah, us, too.

11:58.774 --> 12:00.808
But Max Burris did give us
a lead, and it's a good thing

12:00.810 --> 12:02.976
you're here, too, because
we need you to keep him safe

12:02.978 --> 12:04.244
until we see
if his lead pans out.

12:04.246 --> 12:06.113
We need to keep
it quiet, too,

12:06.115 --> 12:07.714
because these guys got reach,
if you know what I'm saying.

12:07.716 --> 12:09.883
They already tried to kill
Burris once to shut him up,

12:09.885 --> 12:11.452
so watch your back.

12:11.454 --> 12:12.786
Oh, don't worry about me.

12:12.788 --> 12:14.354
Nobody's gonna
scare me away from doing

12:14.356 --> 12:17.591
everything I can
to help Pride.

12:23.799 --> 12:25.599
All right, we got something.

12:25.601 --> 12:28.869
Need you to deep dive on a
person named Amelia Parsons.

12:28.871 --> 12:31.104
Burris says that's his contact
at the law firm.

12:31.106 --> 12:33.407
He says she's the facilitator,
so whatever's going on

12:33.409 --> 12:35.242
goes through her, so if we can
get something on her...

12:35.244 --> 12:36.810
Might be able to bust
up the conspiracy.

12:36.812 --> 12:38.679
Yeah, or at least
work our way up the food chain,

12:38.681 --> 12:39.947
see who everybody's
answering to.

12:39.949 --> 12:41.048
All right, let's do our thing.

12:41.050 --> 12:42.249
No, we'll work with Patton.

12:42.251 --> 12:44.151
I need you to do surveillance.

12:44.153 --> 12:47.187
Oh. O-Okay,
who am I surveilling?

12:47.189 --> 12:49.556
Someone who's a pro, savvy,
and if you're not careful,

12:49.558 --> 12:51.391
you will be spotted.

12:52.628 --> 12:54.561
All right, I'm down. Who is it?

12:54.563 --> 12:56.163
Pride.

12:56.165 --> 12:58.465
Dwayne Pride?

12:59.635 --> 13:01.435
Turns out AAG Barlow

13:01.437 --> 13:02.903
is from New Orleans originally.

13:02.905 --> 13:05.072
Started out
at St. Martin's Episcopal,

13:05.074 --> 13:08.242
then, went to boarding school in
D.C., then to Harvard, Oxford.

13:08.244 --> 13:09.343
Hold on.

13:09.345 --> 13:10.777
Is his father Frank Dumet?

13:10.779 --> 13:13.380
Yes, but he took
his mother's maiden name

13:13.382 --> 13:15.649
once Dumet went to prison
for corruption.

13:15.651 --> 13:18.218
Now I know why he seemed
so familiar.

13:18.220 --> 13:19.386
You know Barlow?

13:19.388 --> 13:21.154
Of him.

13:21.156 --> 13:24.525
His father and my father used to
run this city back in the day.

13:24.527 --> 13:28.795
Looks like Dumet was grooming
his son to do the same.

13:28.797 --> 13:29.930
Huh.

13:29.932 --> 13:32.366
The prodigal son
returning home.

13:32.368 --> 13:34.268
No wonder he wants
me sidelined.

13:34.270 --> 13:35.636
Which is exactly
where you should stay,

13:35.638 --> 13:37.170
as far as I'm concerned.

13:37.172 --> 13:40.107
That's both my professional
and my personal opinion.

13:40.109 --> 13:43.443
Going up against Barlow is like
David going up against Goliath.

13:43.445 --> 13:44.778
Didn't David win?

13:44.780 --> 13:45.913
My point is that...

13:45.915 --> 13:47.948
I know what your
point is, Newman.

13:47.950 --> 13:49.783
My point is,

13:49.785 --> 13:52.119
if I don't stop him, who will?

13:52.121 --> 13:54.454
But you don't even know what
you're trying to stop him from.

13:54.456 --> 13:56.323
Well, that's what
my team's for.

13:56.325 --> 13:58.091
Your team? But I thought
you said you weren't willing

13:58.093 --> 13:59.793
to risk putting your agents...

13:59.795 --> 14:03.363
Not that team, my other team.

14:03.365 --> 14:05.966
You got to be pretty desperate
if you called me, Dwayne.

14:05.968 --> 14:08.068
Hey.

14:08.070 --> 14:10.671
But your buddy Kane, here,
filled us in.

14:10.673 --> 14:11.738
It's Crane.

14:11.740 --> 14:12.940
It's Oliver Crane.

14:12.942 --> 14:14.374
After printing
all that bull about Pride,

14:14.376 --> 14:16.310
you're lucky
it's not Oliver Twist.

14:16.312 --> 14:18.245
I don't even know
what that even means.

14:18.247 --> 14:19.846
It means you're lucky you're
not breathing out of a tube.

14:19.848 --> 14:21.281
You started this mess.

14:21.283 --> 14:22.482
I was used.

14:22.484 --> 14:23.684
You were played.

14:23.686 --> 14:24.851
You're an idiot.

14:24.853 --> 14:26.219
I like her.

14:26.221 --> 14:27.621
Where'd you find her?

14:27.623 --> 14:29.022
Triple Frontier.

14:29.024 --> 14:31.291
- Long story.
- Whoa.

14:31.293 --> 14:33.026
Elvis Bertrand.

14:33.996 --> 14:36.330
Sydney Halliday, Oliver Crane.

14:36.332 --> 14:38.732
This is Fred Newman,
he's my attorney.

14:38.734 --> 14:41.134
Sorry, but I'm a
little confused.

14:41.136 --> 14:43.971
How exactly are they gonna
help us with Barlow?

14:43.973 --> 14:45.606
By hook or by crook.

14:45.608 --> 14:47.307
Take a load off,
let's get started.

14:47.309 --> 14:49.376
Do they have any idea
how dangerous he is?

14:49.378 --> 14:53.413
Yeah, well,
Barlow is very dangerous.

14:53.415 --> 14:55.849
If I'm right,
he's already had people killed,

14:55.851 --> 14:57.084
which means you need to know

14:57.086 --> 14:59.119
that he will not hesitate

14:59.121 --> 15:00.187
to kill again if he has to.

15:00.189 --> 15:01.488
Doesn't matter.

15:01.490 --> 15:02.723
He used me to burn you.

15:02.725 --> 15:04.157
I'm here to return the favor.

15:04.159 --> 15:05.926
This sounds like
one of those deep state

15:05.928 --> 15:08.862
conspiracy deals,
which is great,

15:08.864 --> 15:10.597
because that's what I live for.

15:10.599 --> 15:11.565
And I guess
I've sort of made

15:11.567 --> 15:13.033
a habit lately

15:13.035 --> 15:14.034
of saving Pride's butt,

15:14.036 --> 15:15.869
ever since he saved mine.

15:15.871 --> 15:17.437
Is that like
one of those

15:17.439 --> 15:20.440
Native American life debt deals?

15:20.442 --> 15:23.477
Guess you've still got friends
in this town after all.

15:23.479 --> 15:25.145
Don't
forget about me.

15:25.147 --> 15:27.514
Thank you for calling.

15:27.516 --> 15:29.549
Thought you could use
some moral support.

15:29.551 --> 15:31.518
Hold on, here. Loretta...

15:31.520 --> 15:32.953
Ah, ah, ah,
don't even try, Dwayne.

15:32.955 --> 15:34.588
After all, I've got
a financial stake

15:34.590 --> 15:35.689
in your well-being,

15:35.691 --> 15:36.690
remember?

15:36.692 --> 15:38.925
It's my bail money.

15:38.927 --> 15:40.027
So,

15:40.029 --> 15:42.663
where do we set up?

15:42.665 --> 15:44.698
♪ I've been waiting in vain ♪

15:44.700 --> 15:46.366
♪ For this station... ♪

15:46.368 --> 15:48.669
<i>Been using</i>
<i>the upstairs for storage</i>

15:48.671 --> 15:50.203
<i>since I bought the bar.</i>

15:50.205 --> 15:54.174
All right, we can just push
everything to the sides.

15:54.176 --> 15:57.477
We got, uh, plenty of tables,
lots of chairs.

15:57.479 --> 16:00.547
The bathroom door's right back
there, against that wall.

16:00.549 --> 16:02.449
It's kind of stuffy, you mind
if I open the balcony door?

16:02.451 --> 16:04.017
No, no, go ahead.

16:04.019 --> 16:05.752
They just haven't
been opened in years, though.

16:05.754 --> 16:07.754
So what's the plan?
Plan is,

16:07.756 --> 16:10.123
we know that all roads
lead to Barlow

16:10.125 --> 16:11.925
and the law firm,

16:11.927 --> 16:14.061
so we learn everything
we can about both,

16:14.063 --> 16:17.664
figure out why they want me
out of the way so bad.

16:17.666 --> 16:19.466
I'm gonna hack
into their central server,

16:19.468 --> 16:22.502
and get all information I can
on you and the NCIS leak.

16:22.504 --> 16:23.970
And the
offshore accounts

16:23.972 --> 16:25.806
that they used to pay Burris
to set up the bots.

16:25.808 --> 16:27.274
Primanalytica,
key that in, too.

16:27.276 --> 16:28.442
Bots?

16:28.444 --> 16:29.676
These guys got bots?

16:29.678 --> 16:31.344
Man, they mean business.

16:31.346 --> 16:32.612
Still,
whatever you do,

16:32.614 --> 16:35.582
you can't leave
any digital trace.

16:35.584 --> 16:37.084
If the U.S. attorney's office
finds out

16:37.086 --> 16:39.686
that Dwayne is behind it,
revoking bail

16:39.688 --> 16:41.288
will be the least
of his problems.

16:41.290 --> 16:42.489
Might have
to breach that law firm

16:42.491 --> 16:43.757
physically, instead.

16:43.759 --> 16:46.093
Can you pull up
any blueprints, schematics?

16:46.095 --> 16:47.627
Ask, and you shall receive.

16:47.629 --> 16:49.029
Crane.

16:49.031 --> 16:50.831
- Yeah.
- I need you to deep-dive Barlow.

16:50.833 --> 16:52.499
I mean, he's awfully cocky,

16:52.501 --> 16:54.167
but I can't believe
he doesn't have a weakness.

16:54.169 --> 16:56.703
- Okay. Yeah, let's get to work, man.
- All right.

17:01.410 --> 17:03.276
I don't like it either,
Sebastian.

17:03.278 --> 17:05.811
Just stay put, and holler at me
if they make a move.

17:05.814 --> 17:07.646
Pride's working with Elvis?

17:07.648 --> 17:09.082
Not only Elvis, but also

17:09.084 --> 17:11.050
his lawyer
and that Oliver Crane dude,

17:11.053 --> 17:13.587
Sydney, and Miss Loretta's
even helping King.

17:13.589 --> 17:15.321
- Helping him with what?
- Getting into a whole bunch of trouble

17:15.324 --> 17:16.623
if we don't
figure this out first.

17:16.625 --> 17:19.425
- Got anything on Amelia Parsons?
- Yeah.

17:19.428 --> 17:22.194
I cross-checked every alphabet
database-- Interpol, too.

17:22.196 --> 17:23.797
She's like
the female Jason Bourne,

17:23.799 --> 17:26.599
complete with m-multiple IDs
and passports.

17:26.602 --> 17:30.637
More than that, she's been
a person of interest

17:30.639 --> 17:34.674
in several high-profile FBI
cases over the last few years.

17:34.676 --> 17:36.510
She's like Teflon,
nothing sticks.

17:36.512 --> 17:38.879
Got friends in high places
like Burris had?

17:38.881 --> 17:42.182
Ha. Way up, all the way up
to Associate Attorney General

17:42.184 --> 17:44.551
Eric Barlow.

17:44.553 --> 17:46.987
Small world, too.
Barlow's father

17:46.989 --> 17:50.457
was a founding partner at--
wait for it--

17:50.459 --> 17:52.526
Connor and Hughes.

17:52.528 --> 17:54.394
Even has an office
there still.

17:54.396 --> 17:57.030
Means Amelia could lead us
to Barlow

17:57.032 --> 17:59.699
if we can get some incriminating
evidence against her.

17:59.701 --> 18:00.901
Yeah, then, hopefully,
we can bust

18:00.903 --> 18:02.502
the conspiracy and clear King.

18:02.504 --> 18:05.238
Hey, any chance you can hack
into her computer at the firm?

18:05.240 --> 18:06.640
I've been trying.

18:06.642 --> 18:09.209
I've been working on
breaking through her firewalls

18:09.211 --> 18:12.245
using proxy sites
and passive attacks.

18:12.247 --> 18:14.614
This girl knows
how to protect herself.

18:14.616 --> 18:17.184
But every program has
a backdoor,

18:17.186 --> 18:19.653
and Crack-a-Hack
is about to kick it in.

18:19.655 --> 18:22.088
Whoa, hold up.

18:22.090 --> 18:23.190
I'm not the only one trying.

18:23.192 --> 18:24.591
What do you mean?

18:24.593 --> 18:25.926
- What's going on?
- What's going on

18:25.928 --> 18:28.795
is someone hijacked my idea.

18:28.797 --> 18:30.831
- And they're blocking me.
- How?

18:30.833 --> 18:31.832
What are you talking about?

18:31.834 --> 18:32.999
Narrow bandwidth,

18:33.001 --> 18:34.634
there's only room for one of us.

18:34.636 --> 18:37.771
And the only other person
I know who knows how to do this

18:37.773 --> 18:39.239
is Elvis.

18:39.241 --> 18:40.273
Elvis?

18:40.275 --> 18:41.775
Wait, but if he's

18:41.777 --> 18:43.310
helping Pride...
- That means Pride

18:43.312 --> 18:45.812
is probably about
to make his move.

18:49.651 --> 18:50.817
Hold on.

18:50.819 --> 18:52.519
Sebastian,
what are you doing here?

18:52.521 --> 18:54.287
Probably about
to make you really mad.

18:54.289 --> 18:55.322
Where are you guys going?

18:55.324 --> 18:56.723
None of your business.
Let's go.

18:56.725 --> 18:58.124
Well, actually,
I'm under strict orders

18:58.126 --> 19:00.126
to not let you leave.

19:00.128 --> 19:01.828
Sebastian, listen to me.

19:01.830 --> 19:03.230
Sorry, King.
You need to get...

19:03.232 --> 19:05.899
But he listens to me now.

19:05.901 --> 19:07.334
Not my choice. HQ says.

19:07.336 --> 19:09.769
Christopher,
what is going on?

19:09.771 --> 19:12.038
We can't let you do whatever
it is you're about to do.

19:12.040 --> 19:13.907
Otherwise, we're gonna
have to arrest you.

19:13.909 --> 19:15.308
What she said.

19:34.531 --> 19:35.764
You were surveilling me?

19:35.766 --> 19:38.500
Now, just hold on,
before you go and get

19:38.502 --> 19:39.835
all upset.
He already is, look at him.

19:39.837 --> 19:41.069
I thought I made it
perfectly clear.

19:41.071 --> 19:42.371
I didn't want you...

19:42.373 --> 19:43.505
Involved, we know.

19:43.507 --> 19:45.240
Doc told us, but too bad.

19:45.242 --> 19:46.942
We care, so get over it.

19:46.944 --> 19:48.477
Whoa, I forgot
how spunky you were.

19:48.479 --> 19:51.146
- Do you guys know each other?
- Look, in the interest of time,

19:51.148 --> 19:53.215
which, I'm gathering,
we don't have much of,

19:53.217 --> 19:57.252
can we just dispense
with the bravado back and forth,

19:57.254 --> 19:59.054
and, perhaps, combine forces?

19:59.056 --> 20:00.622
- Loretta.
- No, Dwayne, no.

20:00.624 --> 20:03.525
I know you don't want anybody
else to get in trouble,

20:03.527 --> 20:06.361
but I'm watching you waste your
precious time trying to convince

20:06.363 --> 20:08.497
these people not to help.

20:08.499 --> 20:10.432
So...

20:11.368 --> 20:13.168
...let them.

20:14.104 --> 20:15.203
Do I have a choice?

20:15.205 --> 20:17.005
No.

20:18.542 --> 20:19.975
All right, sit down.

20:19.977 --> 20:21.109
I'll tell you
what we know so far,

20:21.111 --> 20:23.445
or at least, what we suspect.

20:23.447 --> 20:25.981
Associate Attorney
General Barlow...

20:25.983 --> 20:29.584
Is probably the D.C. powerbroker
that's been gunning for you.

20:29.586 --> 20:31.420
- How do you know that?
- Because the facilitator

20:31.422 --> 20:33.588
of the whole deal
does his dirty work for him.

20:33.590 --> 20:35.123
Amelia Parsons.

20:35.125 --> 20:36.491
Wait, you know about Amelia?

20:36.493 --> 20:37.926
He knows about her;
he's been trying to block me

20:37.928 --> 20:39.194
from getting
her server the whole time.

20:39.196 --> 20:40.495
That was
you, Patton?

20:40.497 --> 20:41.897
Oh, my gosh, great work

20:41.899 --> 20:43.598
h-hacking into that puppy.

20:43.600 --> 20:44.766
But I thought
you said you couldn't

20:44.768 --> 20:46.368
get past her last firewall?

20:46.370 --> 20:48.136
I couldn't, I've never seen
anything like it, either.

20:48.138 --> 20:51.173
Which is why we were about to go
break into her office instead.

20:51.175 --> 20:52.340
Well, yeah,
I hope you guys are prepared

20:52.342 --> 20:54.009
to break into an air gap room.

20:54.011 --> 20:56.545
An air gap, what-- you mean,
like, a Faraday cage?

20:56.547 --> 20:57.579
Whatever it's called,
it's apparently the reason

20:57.581 --> 20:58.847
why you guys couldn't break

20:58.849 --> 20:59.848
into Amelia's computer.

20:59.850 --> 21:00.982
At least from
the outside, anyway.

21:00.984 --> 21:04.119
She has all the content
digitally protected.

21:04.121 --> 21:05.420
The only way to access it

21:05.422 --> 21:06.588
is to disable the air gap

21:06.590 --> 21:08.123
inside, first.

21:08.125 --> 21:09.224
Must be some pretty juicy stuff

21:09.226 --> 21:11.259
in there, Dwayne,
to go to this extreme.

21:11.261 --> 21:12.360
Could be the whole conspiracy.

21:12.362 --> 21:14.362
We could take down
the whole house of cards.

21:14.364 --> 21:15.897
And maybe Barlow, too.

21:15.899 --> 21:17.933
Might be the only way
to exonerate you, Dwayne.

21:17.935 --> 21:19.634
Look, all I care about
is finding out

21:19.636 --> 21:21.470
why he's gone through
all of this

21:21.472 --> 21:24.072
and stopping
whatever he's planned.

21:24.074 --> 21:25.407
Sounds like breaking
into the law firm

21:25.409 --> 21:27.442
might be the only way to do it.

21:27.444 --> 21:28.610
Not gonna be easy, though.

21:28.612 --> 21:30.112
No doubt that building

21:30.114 --> 21:32.447
is covered in armed guards
and security cameras.

21:32.449 --> 21:34.282
Means you can't do it alone.

21:34.284 --> 21:35.884
Yeah, she means without us.

21:39.823 --> 21:42.958
Let's figure out a way
to kick some ass.

21:42.960 --> 21:44.860
- Yes!
- Come on!

21:44.862 --> 21:46.027
Yeah!

21:46.029 --> 21:48.263
Who's with me?

21:51.969 --> 21:55.704
Everything looks pretty normal,
at least on the outside.

21:56.062 --> 21:58.393
The law firm is
on the top floor,

21:58.394 --> 21:59.798
so pretty sure their guards

21:59.799 --> 22:01.613
keep a low profile
unless they're needed.

22:01.614 --> 22:02.780
You got that right.

22:02.782 --> 22:04.047
Now, all the security cameras

22:04.049 --> 22:05.950
are running through
a high-tech command center,

22:05.951 --> 22:07.884
just like in a casino.

22:07.886 --> 22:09.986
I can override them
to an extent,

22:09.988 --> 22:12.185
but guns'll come flying out
if anything looks hinky,

22:12.186 --> 22:12.817
believe me.

22:12.851 --> 22:15.231
Look, let's just hope
that they get in,

22:15.426 --> 22:17.626
get what Amelia's got
and get out

22:17.628 --> 22:19.194
before setting off alarms.

22:19.196 --> 22:20.696
What are the chances of that?

22:20.698 --> 22:21.830
We're about to find out.

22:21.832 --> 22:23.632
Here come Pride and Newman.

22:23.634 --> 22:25.334
Crane just texted.

22:25.336 --> 22:28.337
Said he found more
dirt on Barlow.

22:28.339 --> 22:30.239
Says you're not
gonna like it.

22:30.241 --> 22:32.074
What more is there
not to like?

22:32.076 --> 22:34.243
Looks like Barlow is
the one that spearheaded

22:34.245 --> 22:36.979
that shipyard the Navy
nearly built last year,

22:36.981 --> 22:38.514
until you stopped it.

22:38.516 --> 22:40.282
Explains why he's got it
out for me.

22:40.284 --> 22:42.084
Wonder what he's
gonna do this time.

22:43.321 --> 22:45.054
Hey, relax.

22:45.056 --> 22:47.189
All we're doing is going
there to talk to him.

22:47.191 --> 22:48.991
Still, what if
he gets suspicious?

22:48.993 --> 22:50.492
What if he figures out
we're just trying to keep him

22:50.494 --> 22:51.827
away from Amelia's office?

22:51.829 --> 22:54.630
I can take
the meeting alone.

22:54.632 --> 22:57.533
No. No, you're right.

22:57.535 --> 23:01.070
I need to do
this for me, too.

23:01.072 --> 23:04.406
Yeah. Come on.

23:07.345 --> 23:09.545
Ah, very kind.

23:33.971 --> 23:36.338
Hurry. You've got
40 flights to climb.

23:36.340 --> 23:38.040
Right. How about
you climb the stairs

23:38.042 --> 23:39.775
and we take the elevator?

23:39.777 --> 23:41.577
Come on, let's go.

23:47.952 --> 23:50.419
Connor and Hughes,
how may I direct your call?

23:50.421 --> 23:53.255
Please hold.

23:53.257 --> 23:55.124
May I help you?

23:55.126 --> 23:59.361
Uh, Dwayne Pride and Fred Newman
to see Mr. Barlow, please.

24:01.599 --> 24:04.433
I'm sorry. Is Mr. Barlow
expecting you?

24:04.435 --> 24:06.001
No. Just tell him
it's Dwayne Pride.

24:06.003 --> 24:07.236
He'll definitely
want to see us.

24:07.238 --> 24:08.837
Excuse me.

24:08.839 --> 24:12.241
I'm here
for the paralegal position.

24:12.243 --> 24:14.309
Uh, up the stairs to the left.

24:14.311 --> 24:15.744
Thank you.

24:15.746 --> 24:18.180
Ooh. I'm late.

24:33.197 --> 24:35.097
Hurry.

24:35.099 --> 24:37.132
Easy for you to say.

24:40.771 --> 24:43.505
- I'm having a fricki'ng heart attack.
- Go, go, go.

24:55.035 --> 25:00.170
I thought I made it clear the
deal was a one-time-only offer.

25:00.171 --> 25:02.171
You want us to leave?

25:02.173 --> 25:04.073
What Agent
Pride means is that

25:04.075 --> 25:06.041
we'd like
to discuss your proposal

25:06.043 --> 25:08.043
in more detail, Mr. Barlow.

25:09.480 --> 25:11.447
<i>Here we go.</i>

25:11.449 --> 25:13.449
Miss Loretta's in.

25:13.451 --> 25:15.017
We're on the clock, Lasalle.

25:17.555 --> 25:19.355
Excuse me, is this Recruiting?

25:19.357 --> 25:21.357
Um...

25:21.359 --> 25:24.126
I'm sorry. I seem to be lost.
I'm here for the paralegal job.

25:24.128 --> 25:26.495
You're in the wrong place.
Recruiting's upstairs.

25:26.497 --> 25:27.997
- It is?
- Mm-hmm.

25:27.999 --> 25:31.266
Oh, my. I swore the nice lady
said downstairs.

25:31.268 --> 25:34.436
I'm sorry.
I'm a bit turned around.

25:34.438 --> 25:35.971
Um... would you mind

25:35.973 --> 25:37.272
showing me where it is?

25:37.274 --> 25:39.241
I, um, I just don't want
to be late.

25:41.078 --> 25:43.045
Sure.

25:46.050 --> 25:47.850
This way.

25:47.852 --> 25:49.785
Thank you so much.

25:55.626 --> 25:57.292
And we're in, Patton.

25:57.294 --> 25:59.595
Don't let Amelia come back
until we're done.

26:01.399 --> 26:02.931
Bingo. Guard the door.

26:02.933 --> 26:06.435
I got to disable
the Faraday cage.

26:16.347 --> 26:18.080
Okay...

26:25.690 --> 26:27.823
Cool. I'm in.
I'm downloading files.

26:27.825 --> 26:29.058
I'll have this in no time.

26:29.060 --> 26:30.759
You better,

26:30.761 --> 26:32.928
because we got two minutes tops
before all hell breaks loose.

26:32.930 --> 26:35.297
You got to hurry up,
'cause Amelia's leaving Wade

26:35.299 --> 26:37.266
and heading back down to you.

26:37.268 --> 26:38.834
Lasalle, text Pride.

26:43.708 --> 26:47.042
I'm sorry. I-I don't understand
what you're saying.

26:47.044 --> 26:49.111
Do you want the deal
or don't you?

26:49.113 --> 26:52.648
- Well...
- Actually, more I think about it,

26:52.650 --> 26:55.651
the less I think I need it now.

26:57.488 --> 26:59.354
I think we're done.

26:59.356 --> 27:00.956
Done? What do you mean?

27:00.958 --> 27:02.991
What the hell is going on?

27:04.361 --> 27:07.296
Wow. You really think
you're something, don't you?

27:07.298 --> 27:09.832
The great Dwayne Pride,

27:09.834 --> 27:11.433
New Orleans' favorite son,

27:11.435 --> 27:12.968
talk of the town.

27:12.970 --> 27:16.071
Although not in a
good way anymore, hmm?

27:17.942 --> 27:19.641
Excuse us.

27:23.447 --> 27:24.747
What do you want, Barlow?

27:24.749 --> 27:27.282
I want to know why
you really came here,

27:27.284 --> 27:31.053
because it wasn't
to make a deal.

27:36.127 --> 27:37.893
Excuse us.

27:47.938 --> 27:49.738
Get out of there.
She's on her way.

27:51.041 --> 27:53.108
The files
are still transferring.

27:53.110 --> 27:54.476
Just pull it out.

27:54.478 --> 27:55.778
I can't. It'll
corrupt the files.

27:55.780 --> 27:57.479
Well, it's better
than getting killed.

27:57.481 --> 27:59.548
I thought you said
you could do this.

27:59.550 --> 28:00.716
It's not an exact science.

28:00.718 --> 28:02.584
Oh, cool. I got it.

28:04.789 --> 28:06.288
Let's jam.

28:07.358 --> 28:09.124
Stop.

28:34.718 --> 28:38.887
Dare I say that went
rather well.

28:38.889 --> 28:41.757
Crap.

28:41.759 --> 28:43.826
Elvis and Sydney
make it out yet?

28:44.895 --> 28:46.795
There. There they are.

28:46.797 --> 28:49.765
Let's get out of here.

28:49.767 --> 28:51.099
My God.
Quick. Come on.

28:51.101 --> 28:53.168
Keep going. Go, go.
Come on, just go!

28:59.610 --> 29:01.977
Go, go!

29:08.919 --> 29:10.853
Come on, Patton. Start the van.

29:10.855 --> 29:12.654
Let's go. Go, go, go.

29:40.937 --> 29:41.984
Oh.

29:42.807 --> 29:44.814
This is bad.
This is really bad.

29:44.969 --> 29:46.630
They weren't suppose to see us.

29:47.469 --> 29:48.238
Newman...

29:48.415 --> 29:50.094
just relax. Okay?

29:52.564 --> 29:53.094
Is it okay?

29:53.118 --> 29:54.118
Yeah.

29:54.296 --> 29:55.752
- Yeah.
- Hey. Hey

29:55.776 --> 29:56.827
I need you to figure out

29:56.851 --> 29:58.237
what's on Amelia's files fast.

29:58.261 --> 29:59.020
Okay.

29:59.271 --> 30:00.364
They're probably encrypted.

30:00.388 --> 30:01.942
- Oh, they're definitely encrypted.
- Yeah.

30:01.966 --> 30:04.284
I'm counting on you Elvis.
Alright, go. Go.

30:04.813 --> 30:06.292
I'll cordinate with Patton.

30:07.023 --> 30:08.790
In a minute,
Barlow will turn over

30:08.792 --> 30:11.125
the security camera footage
to the authorities,

30:11.127 --> 30:12.560
which means that
in less than a minute,

30:12.562 --> 30:14.896
the FBI will be here
to arrest you again.

30:14.898 --> 30:17.265
Can't he say he was just having
a meeting with Barlow?

30:17.267 --> 30:20.401
No. Won't take them long to
attach me to what everybody did.

30:20.403 --> 30:22.437
Breaking and entering,
contempt of court...

30:22.439 --> 30:24.038
Retaliation against
an officer of the court,

30:24.040 --> 30:25.606
obstruction of justice.

30:25.608 --> 30:27.442
Barlow will throw away the key.

30:27.444 --> 30:30.345
Why Patton's working on erasing
the footage as we speak.

30:30.347 --> 30:31.980
Well, what if he can't?

30:31.982 --> 30:33.314
Dwayne, listen to me.

30:33.316 --> 30:34.816
This is serious.

30:34.818 --> 30:36.184
They are coming for you

30:36.186 --> 30:37.418
and there's nothing
I can do to stop them.

30:37.420 --> 30:39.253
You can stall them, can't you?

30:39.255 --> 30:41.522
- Sorry?
- Wow them with legalese.

30:41.524 --> 30:43.825
Be the lawyer
you used to be,

30:43.827 --> 30:45.159
the one you still can be.

30:45.161 --> 30:46.728
This is your chance.

30:46.730 --> 30:49.297
Just buy us enough time
to get Barlow's plan.

30:49.299 --> 30:51.432
It still won't
hold up in court.

30:51.434 --> 30:53.034
It was stolen.

30:53.036 --> 30:55.970
Fruit of the poison tree.

30:55.972 --> 30:58.840
Newman, it doesn't have
to hold up in court to stop him.

30:58.842 --> 31:01.309
We just need to get them into
the court of public opinion

31:01.311 --> 31:03.111
and let the media do the rest.

31:03.113 --> 31:04.379
It worked against me, didn't it?

31:04.381 --> 31:05.646
- Eh.
- As soon as Elvis

31:05.648 --> 31:06.681
decrypts the files,

31:06.683 --> 31:08.282
we'll send them to Crane
to publish.

31:08.284 --> 31:10.184
Shouldn't take the authorities
long to investigate.

31:10.186 --> 31:12.320
Sydney, stay with Newman.

31:12.322 --> 31:13.521
Help him out.

31:13.523 --> 31:15.189
I'm gonna go help Elvis.

31:17.193 --> 31:19.060
This is crazy.

31:19.062 --> 31:21.162
Every single time I get past
one of their firewalls...

31:21.164 --> 31:23.164
Another one
pops up, I know.

31:23.166 --> 31:25.733
I can't hold an image
long enough to erase anything.

31:25.735 --> 31:27.168
Intrusion detection system?

31:27.170 --> 31:29.670
Got to be,
but mutating firewalls?

31:29.672 --> 31:31.272
That's about as
sophisticated as it gets.

31:31.274 --> 31:32.940
Yeah, well, Barlow obviously
has a lot to protect,

31:32.942 --> 31:34.609
and they got to know
what we're trying to do.

31:34.611 --> 31:36.244
Got to do it, too,
'cause otherwise,

31:36.246 --> 31:38.913
Pride is dust and Lasalle
is in charge permanently.

31:38.915 --> 31:40.648
Oh, man, now you're
really scaring me.

31:40.650 --> 31:42.483
- What's going on?
- Uh, no-- I'm joking.

31:42.485 --> 31:44.085
Joking about what?

31:45.088 --> 31:47.822
Never mind, you guys
erase the footage yet?

31:47.824 --> 31:49.624
- Still trying.
- Well, we're running out of time.

31:49.626 --> 31:51.759
Just got an earful
from the Deputy Director,

31:51.761 --> 31:53.961
who got an earful
from the AAG.

31:53.963 --> 31:55.863
Barlow's filed a complaint
against Pride.

31:55.865 --> 31:59.233
Guys, FBI's on their way
to Pride's bar to arrest him.

32:08.244 --> 32:10.311
Thanks, Chris.

32:10.313 --> 32:12.513
That's why I didn't want you
guys getting directly involved.

32:12.515 --> 32:14.715
The FBI can't pin
anything on you,

32:14.717 --> 32:17.251
so don't give them a reason to,

32:17.253 --> 32:20.621
no matter what happens
to me, understood?

32:24.027 --> 32:26.828
FBI's on their way.
Any luck?

32:26.830 --> 32:29.430
I wish I had better news
for you, pal, but I don't.

32:29.432 --> 32:30.465
Can't say as I'm surprised

32:30.467 --> 32:31.866
based on who we're going up
against here.

32:31.868 --> 32:34.402
It's gonna take some time
to decrypt these files.

32:34.404 --> 32:36.237
He doesn't have time.

32:36.239 --> 32:40.007
They're here,
and Amelia's with them.

32:40.009 --> 32:42.210
Whatev... forget it
and get out of here.

32:42.212 --> 32:43.878
- No way.
- I mean it, Elvis.

32:43.880 --> 32:45.346
They're not gonna stop with me
and you know it.

32:45.348 --> 32:48.149
If they have me on tape,
they got you, too.

32:48.151 --> 32:49.650
Damn it, Dwayne,
I'm not gonna run, okay?

32:49.652 --> 32:51.119
Not from this,
not from what

32:51.121 --> 32:52.420
Barlow's trying to do you,

32:52.422 --> 32:54.122
so let me finish my work.

32:55.458 --> 32:58.126
Please.

33:08.404 --> 33:11.072
Time to nut up, Newman.

33:11.074 --> 33:13.074
Assistant U.S.
Attorney Jackson,

33:13.076 --> 33:16.777
and I have an arrest warrant
for Dwayne Pride. Where is he?

33:18.548 --> 33:22.049
I'd like to see the
warrant first, please.

33:22.051 --> 33:23.284
And you are?

33:23.286 --> 33:26.187
Fred Newman, Esquire.

33:26.189 --> 33:28.256
I'm Mr. Pride's
personal attorney.

33:28.258 --> 33:31.759
And he's part of the break-in,
too. We've got him on tape.

33:31.761 --> 33:34.662
I was merely accompanying
my client to a meeting

33:34.664 --> 33:37.031
with the Associate
Attorney General.

33:37.033 --> 33:38.466
Then how come you're with her?

33:38.468 --> 33:41.269
She broke into my office
and stole sensitive files.

33:41.271 --> 33:43.771
The warrant, please?

33:48.378 --> 33:50.344
You and me have got
some unfinished business.

33:50.346 --> 33:51.712
Looking forward to it.

33:57.020 --> 33:58.152
Got it.

34:05.061 --> 34:08.129
Mm. Felony warrant's
not signed,

34:08.130 --> 34:10.063
makes it invalid.

34:11.301 --> 34:12.867
Let me see.

34:20.176 --> 34:21.542
That's a minor
technicality.

34:21.543 --> 34:24.045
The warrant's based
on irrefutable evidence.

34:24.047 --> 34:25.079
Yeah? Let's see it.

34:28.318 --> 34:30.585
I don't understand.
What happened?

34:31.487 --> 34:33.487
You saw it, we had it.

34:37.427 --> 34:38.626
They must've erased it somehow.

34:38.628 --> 34:41.462
Whoa! Talk about
conspiracy theories.

34:41.464 --> 34:44.498
What I mean
to say is,

34:44.500 --> 34:47.335
prove it.

34:47.337 --> 34:48.735
Hmm.

35:09.926 --> 35:12.159
Pride's still free.

35:12.161 --> 35:13.961
That's okay.

35:13.963 --> 35:16.764
Still, he's got the files.
It's only a matter of time

35:16.766 --> 35:18.866
before he pieces
it all together.

35:22.305 --> 35:23.504
I'm aware.

35:23.506 --> 35:25.573
So what do we do?

35:25.575 --> 35:28.409
Eliminate some of the pieces.

35:48.031 --> 35:49.964
Hey, Pride!

36:02.645 --> 36:04.145
What?

36:04.147 --> 36:07.782
Nothing. It's just...

36:07.784 --> 36:12.119
despite it all,
you seem so... calm.

36:12.121 --> 36:15.156
Well, been through worse.

36:15.158 --> 36:16.490
Really?

36:16.492 --> 36:17.892
I'm not so sure.

36:17.894 --> 36:22.129
Dwayne, you amaze me.

36:22.131 --> 36:24.165
You're still trying
to save the city

36:24.167 --> 36:26.400
even though they turned
the city against you.

36:26.402 --> 36:29.770
Guess I'm just a glutton
for punishment.

36:29.772 --> 36:32.840
I don't know, Loretta.

36:32.842 --> 36:35.810
It's not like I'm trying
to prove anything to anybody.

36:35.812 --> 36:39.347
I'm just...
trying to do what's right.

36:39.349 --> 36:40.781
Yeah.

36:40.783 --> 36:44.185
Even though it bites me
in the ass sometimes.

36:44.187 --> 36:46.053
It's who I am.

36:46.055 --> 36:49.357
Besides, born and raised here,
what else am I gonna do?

36:49.359 --> 36:52.293
I... I love this city.

36:54.330 --> 36:56.564
Feel like I owe it.

37:03.373 --> 37:07.408
Hey, Dwayne,
I got something.

37:07.410 --> 37:09.777
What is it?

37:09.779 --> 37:11.746
Still working on
decrypting the rest,

37:11.748 --> 37:13.848
but this looks
like a list.

37:13.850 --> 37:16.984
I got names and profiles
and itineraries.

37:16.986 --> 37:20.421
Yeah, surveillance
and route maps.

37:20.423 --> 37:22.356
Looks like they're being cased.

37:22.358 --> 37:24.792
Is it a hit list?

37:24.794 --> 37:27.228
- Can you get me any names?
- Yeah, let's see, here.

37:27.230 --> 37:29.964
Well, you're on it, natch.

37:29.966 --> 37:31.999
I can't-- Can you make out
that name? It's funky.

37:32.001 --> 37:34.335
Mayor Taylor's on it.

37:35.438 --> 37:38.172
That's Max Burris.

37:38.174 --> 37:39.740
Captain Estes.

37:39.742 --> 37:41.942
Hey, that's dated tonight.

37:47.984 --> 37:49.750
Should've known

37:49.752 --> 37:50.718
you'd find a way to dodge

37:50.720 --> 37:51.786
that arrest warrant, Dwayne.

37:51.788 --> 37:52.853
Carl, where are you?

37:52.855 --> 37:54.889
Me? Just getting in my car
to head home.

37:54.891 --> 37:56.056
Okay, listen, Carl.

37:56.058 --> 37:57.258
What's the problem?

37:57.260 --> 37:58.392
Listen to me, it's important.

37:58.394 --> 37:59.660
You're in danger.

37:59.662 --> 38:02.062
You got to get back inside.
They're after you.

38:05.635 --> 38:08.269
Carl? Carl, are you there? C...

38:10.606 --> 38:12.773
Can you...

38:12.775 --> 38:14.442
Can you hear me, Carl?

38:47.161 --> 38:50.763
Can't believe
he's gone, King.

38:50.765 --> 38:52.898
We're gonna get the people
who did this, Christopher,

38:52.900 --> 38:55.301
I promise.

38:55.303 --> 38:57.503
No doubt.

38:58.806 --> 39:01.240
Hold up. How'd you know?
Who called you?

39:01.242 --> 39:04.010
Nobody called. I knew.

39:04.012 --> 39:06.746
Elvis found a hit list
in Amelia's files.

39:11.085 --> 39:12.852
Carl was on it.

39:15.623 --> 39:16.989
Dwayne.

39:23.598 --> 39:26.365
Does his wife know?

39:26.367 --> 39:28.300
Not yet.

39:28.302 --> 39:31.671
I was just about to...

39:31.673 --> 39:34.974
go over to the house, and, uh...

39:34.976 --> 39:37.410
I don't want her to hear
about it from anyone else.

39:37.412 --> 39:39.745
Thank you.

39:39.747 --> 39:42.815
Chris, you know
Deputy Chief Gossett.

39:42.817 --> 39:46.552
Yeah, 'course.
Sorry for your loss, Chief.

39:46.554 --> 39:48.454
I appreciate that.

39:48.456 --> 39:51.590
I'm almost afraid to ask this.

39:51.592 --> 39:56.295
This have anything
to do with NCIS?

39:56.297 --> 39:57.697
I'm afraid so.

39:57.699 --> 39:59.765
But, honestly, Cedric,

39:59.767 --> 40:01.701
the less you know, the better.

40:01.703 --> 40:04.136
What're you talking about?

40:04.138 --> 40:05.638
If you know who killed Carl...

40:05.640 --> 40:08.507
I don't, not for sure.

40:08.509 --> 40:12.244
But if I'm right,
he's as powerful as they get

40:12.246 --> 40:14.213
and I don't want something

40:14.215 --> 40:17.516
like this to happen to you.

40:17.518 --> 40:19.952
I'm not just gonna
let this go, Dwayne.

40:19.954 --> 40:22.221
- I'm gonna find the bastard who did this...
- Oh-- I-- Okay, I-I get it.

40:22.223 --> 40:24.490
Okay, I just want you
to be careful.

40:27.361 --> 40:28.994
Last thing Carl...

40:30.665 --> 40:33.332
The last thing
that Carl would want

40:33.334 --> 40:35.367
would be if anything
would happen to you.

40:40.441 --> 40:42.208
I'd better go tell June.

40:51.552 --> 40:54.019
Barlow's gonna pay
for this, Chris.

40:54.021 --> 40:56.155
Yeah, still, I don't know
what killing Estes

40:56.157 --> 40:57.356
has anything
to do with...

40:57.358 --> 40:58.858
Yeah, well,
I don't either,

40:58.860 --> 41:01.460
but we better find out
before anybody else gets killed,

41:01.462 --> 41:03.362
starting with
Mayor Taylor.

41:03.364 --> 41:05.598
Wait, the mayor
was on the list?

41:05.600 --> 41:09.268
I-It's okay. I got NOPD
doubling up on protection.

41:09.270 --> 41:10.903
Well, who else?

41:10.905 --> 41:14.507
Elvis was still working on
decrypting other names.

41:14.509 --> 41:16.208
I got to tell him
and the others

41:16.210 --> 41:18.844
to get away from here
till it's over.

41:18.846 --> 41:21.113
It's not s...
It's just too dangerous.

41:21.115 --> 41:23.087
Max Burris was
on the list, too.

41:23.088 --> 41:24.620
That means we got to,
we got to move him...

41:24.644 --> 41:25.490
Wait a second.

41:25.491 --> 41:28.025
to a safe house.
- King, you didn't hear?

41:28.027 --> 41:29.726
What?

41:29.728 --> 41:32.329
Officer found Max Burris
in his cell,

41:32.331 --> 41:33.964
hanging from a sheet.

41:41.040 --> 41:42.672
Pride, should you be here?

41:42.674 --> 41:44.341
Doesn't matter,
all bets are off now.

41:44.343 --> 41:46.276
Elvis, what're you doing here?

41:46.278 --> 41:48.178
Needed help decrypting
the rest of the files,

41:48.180 --> 41:49.679
and we're making
great progress, too.

41:49.681 --> 41:52.049
- Meaning what?
- Meaning we just hit

41:52.051 --> 41:53.450
the mother lode,
that's what.

41:53.452 --> 41:55.485
We done unlocked
the whole kit and caboodle.

41:55.487 --> 41:56.820
Well, not all of it.

41:56.822 --> 41:58.789
But enough to know what it
looks like Barlow's targeting.

41:58.791 --> 42:00.023
What?

42:00.025 --> 42:01.558
You're not gonna
believe this.

42:03.695 --> 42:04.995
Wait.

42:04.997 --> 42:07.564
- The Navy?
- Yeah, not just our navy.

42:07.566 --> 42:09.032
Apparently, he's
targeting the British

42:09.034 --> 42:10.534
and Canadian navies, too.

42:10.536 --> 42:12.402
All right,
but how and why?

42:12.404 --> 42:15.472
I don't know how,
don't know why, just where.

42:15.474 --> 42:18.108
All those ships, they're coming
up the Mississippi tomorrow

42:18.110 --> 42:19.509
for Fleet Week.

42:19.511 --> 42:22.979
To celebrate
the city's tricentennial,

42:22.981 --> 42:25.215
the biggest event
of the year.

42:49.074 --> 42:51.808
You know, I've moved a lot of
hardware for a lot of folks.

42:51.810 --> 42:54.978
But these? I'm just not trying
to get jammed up with anything.

42:54.980 --> 42:56.213
That's what the money's for.

42:57.316 --> 42:58.715
This cargo's
been making me nervous

42:58.717 --> 43:00.083
ever since I loaded it.

43:02.788 --> 43:05.255
Yeah. We good.

43:06.291 --> 43:07.624
The keys?

43:07.626 --> 43:09.126
To the truck?

43:09.128 --> 43:10.560
Mm-hmm.

43:11.463 --> 43:14.064
How am I supposed
to get out of here?

43:14.066 --> 43:15.098
You're not.

43:18.070 --> 43:19.903
Grab the keys, move the body.

Dropped Newman off at

44:08.387 --> 44:10.020
Should be safe
until this blows over.

44:10.022 --> 44:12.556
Finally convinced Elvis
to get off the grid, too.

44:12.558 --> 44:15.425
Figured, since Estes was killed,
he'd be a little more motivated;

44:15.427 --> 44:17.194
I had to personally
threaten him

44:17.196 --> 44:19.296
with federal arrest
to get him to leave.

44:19.298 --> 44:22.299
Crane's in D.C., still running
background on Barlow,

44:22.301 --> 44:24.834
generally out of harm's way.
That leaves Sydney.

44:24.836 --> 44:27.404
I haven't been able
to reach her. Anyone else?

44:27.406 --> 44:28.405
We've been
going through the data

44:28.407 --> 44:30.373
from Amelia's hard drive.

44:30.375 --> 44:33.310
Yeah, classified documents
covering every detail

44:33.312 --> 44:34.978
of the Tricentennial Fleet Week.

44:34.980 --> 44:37.714
Thousands of sailors,
hundreds of VIPs,

44:37.716 --> 44:39.316
dozens of major events.

44:39.318 --> 44:40.650
I'm decrypting files.
Yeah.

44:40.652 --> 44:41.918
And we're no closer
to figuring out

44:41.920 --> 44:43.520
who or what Barlow's targeting.

44:43.522 --> 44:44.988
Eric Barlow's from
one of the most

44:44.990 --> 44:47.490
powerful families
in New Orleans.

44:47.492 --> 44:49.559
He's the number
three man at Justice.

44:49.561 --> 44:53.330
If he's after the Navy,
you got to know

44:53.332 --> 44:55.832
there's a huge
upside for him.

44:55.834 --> 44:58.368
How does he benefit
from an attack?

44:58.370 --> 45:00.103
Still working on that answer.

45:00.105 --> 45:02.172
- Yeah.
- King.

45:02.174 --> 45:03.306
What's all this?

45:03.308 --> 45:04.541
Oh, personal items.

45:04.543 --> 45:05.875
I'm banned from NCIS.

45:05.877 --> 45:07.444
Not sure when
I'll be back.

45:07.446 --> 45:09.212
Well, I mean, we just broke into
Connor and Hughes

45:09.214 --> 45:10.747
to steal all this data,
I don't think you have to worry

45:10.749 --> 45:11.948
about the fine print
of your suspension...

45:11.950 --> 45:14.017
<i>I</i> broke into Connor and Hughes.

45:14.019 --> 45:15.352
Four of you had
nothing to do with it.

45:15.354 --> 45:16.586
All evidence to the contrary.

45:16.588 --> 45:18.855
That's my point.

45:18.857 --> 45:21.591
All these files, they're
not admissible as evidence.

45:21.593 --> 45:24.327
Which means you can never
explain how you got them.

45:24.329 --> 45:26.329
Use them to figure out
Barlow's next move.

45:26.331 --> 45:28.365
Figure out another way
to take him down.

45:28.367 --> 45:29.933
After we warn

45:29.935 --> 45:31.534
the Navy about the threat.

45:31.536 --> 45:32.936
You can't alert them.

45:32.938 --> 45:34.104
I already lost my badge.

45:34.106 --> 45:35.572
I need the team intact,

45:35.574 --> 45:38.108
working this case
officially.

45:38.110 --> 45:39.709
Hey, well, someone's
got to alert the Navy.

45:39.711 --> 45:40.677
Yep, me.

45:40.679 --> 45:41.911
Hold on, you just said that...
Look.

45:41.913 --> 45:43.713
I got nothing to lose.
I'm indicted.

45:43.715 --> 45:45.782
I'm facing years in prison.

45:45.784 --> 45:47.884
And I'm the lucky one.

45:49.221 --> 45:51.588
Estes was murdered in cold blood

45:51.590 --> 45:53.890
for far less
than we've done already.

45:53.892 --> 45:56.026
Find out where this attack

45:56.028 --> 45:58.495
is taking place, and stop it.

46:00.065 --> 46:02.198
All right, well,
you heard the man.

46:02.200 --> 46:03.633
Keep digging
into that data,

46:03.635 --> 46:05.502
and see if we can
narrow down the target.

46:05.504 --> 46:07.537
Pride's right, we need
a clean case on Barlow.

46:07.539 --> 46:09.606
He lasted this long without
getting his hands dirty.

46:09.608 --> 46:11.041
Can't say the same
for Amelia.

46:11.043 --> 46:13.443
She's got her fingers
in every move he makes.

46:13.445 --> 46:14.711
She's still at it.

46:14.713 --> 46:15.979
Sydney just sent me this.

46:15.981 --> 46:17.447
Who's he?

46:17.449 --> 46:18.848
She said he's some kind
of gunrunner.

46:18.850 --> 46:22.419
Sydney said Amelia shot him
at the Carville Salvage yard,

46:22.421 --> 46:24.120
took his truck--
she's following him.

46:24.122 --> 46:25.822
Well, tell her to stop.

46:25.824 --> 46:27.023
I'm on it.

46:27.025 --> 46:28.224
Okay, new plan.

46:28.226 --> 46:29.859
Sebastian,
we got a crime scene.

46:29.861 --> 46:31.194
Patton, Gregorio,

46:31.196 --> 46:32.996
find out where the hell
Amelia and Sydney are.

46:32.998 --> 46:34.497
Let's roll.

46:36.168 --> 46:39.069
Mayor Taylor, we've got street
closures along the riverfront.

46:39.071 --> 46:40.603
200 extra officers

46:40.605 --> 46:42.939
from multiple jurisdictions
for added crowd control.

46:42.941 --> 46:45.041
Coast Guard patrols will
run on an extended schedule

46:45.043 --> 46:47.510
through the week. And our
force protection protocols are in effect.

46:47.512 --> 46:50.714
We can all agree that safety
is of the utmost concern,

46:50.716 --> 46:52.916
but let's not forget,
this is a celebration.

46:52.918 --> 46:54.984
New Orleans is 300 years old.

46:54.986 --> 46:56.119
We need
to honor that.

46:56.121 --> 46:57.120
Mayor Taylor!

46:57.122 --> 46:58.855
I need to
speak to you.

46:58.857 --> 47:00.390
Dwayne, what are you doing?

47:00.392 --> 47:01.658
Please, it's important.

47:01.660 --> 47:04.561
Let him go, let him go.

47:05.931 --> 47:08.665
Listen, we... we have
reason to believe

47:08.667 --> 47:09.899
that there's
gonna be an attack.

47:09.901 --> 47:10.934
It's imminent.

47:10.936 --> 47:12.802
What can you tell us?

47:12.804 --> 47:15.171
Not much, just that it's gonna
happen here at Fleet Week.

47:15.173 --> 47:16.573
You have
actionable evidence?

47:16.575 --> 47:17.841
Eh, it's complicated.

47:17.843 --> 47:19.476
You either have the
evidence, or you don't.

47:19.478 --> 47:20.643
It couldn't be
less complicated.

47:20.645 --> 47:21.945
All I can say is

47:21.947 --> 47:25.014
that the suspects accessed
classified documents:

47:25.016 --> 47:26.683
ship blueprints,
itineraries,

47:26.685 --> 47:27.917
threat assessments,

47:27.919 --> 47:28.985
your whole playbook.

47:28.987 --> 47:30.720
You're Dwayne Pride, right?

47:30.722 --> 47:32.722
That NCIS agent
I keep reading about?

47:32.724 --> 47:35.358
I know I don't seem like the
most reliable source these days,

47:35.360 --> 47:37.227
but I'm telling you the truth.

47:37.229 --> 47:38.561
You're not telling
us anything.

47:38.563 --> 47:39.896
Not where, not what,

47:39.898 --> 47:41.331
not even how
you came to this conclusion.

47:41.333 --> 47:42.866
What can you say, Dwayne?

47:42.868 --> 47:44.067
Who's responsible?

47:44.069 --> 47:46.069
He's gonna tell you
that it's me.

47:46.071 --> 47:48.772
Or did I spoil your punch line?

47:48.774 --> 47:50.340
The associate attorney general
of the United States

47:50.342 --> 47:51.508
staging a terrorist attack?

47:51.510 --> 47:53.176
- Listen to...
- Not just me.

47:53.178 --> 47:55.011
It's-it's a conspiracy,
right?

47:55.013 --> 47:56.546
I mean, I set you up.

47:56.548 --> 47:59.015
Opened an investigation
into viable claims

47:59.017 --> 48:01.384
of abuse of power,
held you accountable.

48:01.386 --> 48:02.419
Am I missing anything?

48:02.421 --> 48:04.454
You also had Carl Estes killed.

48:04.456 --> 48:06.189
Dwayne.
You...

48:06.191 --> 48:09.659
are a paranoid
and desperate man.

48:09.661 --> 48:11.261
And if you don't
leave immediately,

48:11.263 --> 48:12.662
I'm gonna have you arrested.

48:12.664 --> 48:15.198
Again.

48:15.200 --> 48:18.435
The rest of us have
a meeting to get to.

48:21.173 --> 48:23.273
What the hell, Dwayne?

48:23.275 --> 48:25.241
You need to take this
seriously, Zahra.

48:25.243 --> 48:28.077
You need to get
out of here, now.

48:28.079 --> 48:29.546
Cedric,
I'm telling you.

48:29.548 --> 48:31.281
Come on.

48:36.788 --> 48:38.121
Christopher?

48:38.123 --> 48:39.589
How'd it go, King?

48:39.591 --> 48:40.957
Well, I'm not in cuffs,
that's a win.

48:40.959 --> 48:42.058
Barlow's here.

48:42.060 --> 48:43.793
Made me out as a lunatic.

48:43.795 --> 48:45.128
We're gonna need hard evidence
if we're gonna

48:45.130 --> 48:46.463
convince anyone
that he's responsible.

48:46.465 --> 48:47.831
Well, we might have something.

48:47.833 --> 48:49.766
Body of gunrunner
named John Fitzpatrick.

48:49.768 --> 48:52.502
Yeah, operated out of El Paso.

48:52.504 --> 48:54.637
Supplied hard to come by
merchandise to local gangs.

48:54.639 --> 48:56.739
Yeah, think he was doing
likewise here, King.

48:56.741 --> 48:57.907
What kind of merchandise?

48:57.909 --> 48:59.976
Don't know, but Amelia
and her man Lonzo

48:59.978 --> 49:01.110
took possession of it,

49:01.112 --> 49:02.779
killed Fitzpatrick
for his trouble.

49:02.781 --> 49:04.147
How do you know that?

49:04.149 --> 49:05.949
Uh, Sydney witnessed it.

49:05.951 --> 49:07.650
She took photos,
sent them back to NCIS.

49:07.652 --> 49:08.885
She's, uh,

49:08.887 --> 49:10.086
she's tailing Amelia right now.

49:10.088 --> 49:11.254
What is she doing?

49:11.256 --> 49:12.822
Sydney's supposed to be gone.

49:12.824 --> 49:14.324
Well, we'd remind her of that,

49:14.326 --> 49:16.926
but she has
switched off her phone.

49:16.928 --> 49:18.628
Find her, Christopher,
and Amelia.

49:18.630 --> 49:20.630
If this murder
is connected to Barlow's plan,

49:20.632 --> 49:24.367
we have a chance to stop him.

49:32.777 --> 49:35.345
Crap.

49:35.347 --> 49:37.113
Who the hell is this?

49:37.115 --> 49:39.482
Gregorio. You want to tell me
what the hell is going on?

49:39.484 --> 49:41.417
My phone was off,
how'd you even get...

49:41.419 --> 49:43.152
Patton hacked it
and turned it on.

49:43.154 --> 49:45.655
Wow, you people
really are intrusive.

49:45.657 --> 49:47.624
We're not the ones playing
cowboys and Indians

49:47.626 --> 49:49.125
with Barlow's button woman;
this isn't your fight.

49:49.127 --> 49:50.660
Hell it's not.

49:50.662 --> 49:52.262
Plus, if I wasn't
keeping an eye on Amelia,

49:52.264 --> 49:53.596
you wouldn't know where she is.

49:53.598 --> 49:56.199
We tracked your GPS,
we know exactly where she is.

49:56.201 --> 49:57.634
The London Lodge Motel.

49:57.636 --> 49:59.369
You can go home now,
let the pros handle this.

49:59.371 --> 50:00.837
It's time. Move, I'll
be right behind you.

50:00.839 --> 50:01.938
I got to go.

50:01.940 --> 50:03.239
They're on the move.

50:03.241 --> 50:05.074
I'll get Amelia to talk.

50:05.076 --> 50:06.676
Just hold tight,
I'll be there in a few minutes.

50:06.678 --> 50:07.844
Sydney.

50:07.846 --> 50:09.312
Sydney!

50:09.314 --> 50:10.380
Damn it.

50:29.935 --> 50:31.200
Don't.

50:33.371 --> 50:35.204
You really are annoying.

50:35.206 --> 50:38.474
And you really are gonna put
those hard drives on the ground.

50:38.476 --> 50:40.677
Doesn't matter, you're too late.

50:40.679 --> 50:42.312
Can't stop
what's about to happen.

50:42.314 --> 50:44.480
Just put the hard drives down.

50:44.482 --> 50:45.582
Of course.

51:30.362 --> 51:31.461
You okay?

51:32.764 --> 51:35.131
Yeah, better than her.

51:51.144 --> 51:53.677
How's this one, Doc?

51:53.679 --> 51:54.879
This one

51:54.881 --> 51:56.781
is doing great.
- Well, if by "great,"

51:56.783 --> 51:59.617
you mean two cracked ribs,
a dislocated shoulder

51:59.619 --> 52:03.921
and a hairline skull fracture,
then, yeah, she's great.

52:03.923 --> 52:05.723
I'm healthier than most
of the patients you see.

52:05.725 --> 52:06.857
Yeah, mouthier, too.

52:06.859 --> 52:07.858
You should be at a hospital.

52:07.860 --> 52:09.393
No, I just need an aspirin.

52:09.395 --> 52:11.662
Then I need to get back
out and get those suspects.

52:11.664 --> 52:13.130
Not going anywhere, Halliday.

52:13.132 --> 52:15.433
I just spent a half an hour
convincing the NOPD

52:15.435 --> 52:17.601
not to arrest you
for aggravated assault.

52:17.603 --> 52:19.770
If it wasn't for me,
you wouldn't have Amelia.

52:19.772 --> 52:22.339
If it wasn't for you, she'd
be able to answer our questions.

52:22.341 --> 52:23.874
Instead, she's at
the Mercy Hospital

52:23.876 --> 52:25.543
in an induced coma.

52:25.545 --> 52:27.445
She did try to kill me.
Because you attempted

52:27.447 --> 52:28.846
to take her down alone.

52:28.848 --> 52:31.115
- Still don't know why.
- Dwayne Pride stood by me

52:31.117 --> 52:33.317
when everyone, including you,
had written me off

52:33.319 --> 52:35.252
as a traitor
and a killer.

52:35.254 --> 52:37.188
I owe him, simple as that.

52:37.190 --> 52:39.089
I'm touched, really.

52:39.091 --> 52:40.224
But we're a team here.

52:40.226 --> 52:42.092
We work together,
or else we don't work at all,

52:42.094 --> 52:43.360
simple as that.

52:43.362 --> 52:45.596
I could've handled
it better.

52:45.598 --> 52:47.398
But you have the
evidence from the motel.

52:47.400 --> 52:48.833
That's got to
mean something.

52:48.835 --> 52:49.934
Sebastian pulled
some tire marks

52:49.936 --> 52:52.770
and the hard drive
Amelia tried to destroy.

52:52.772 --> 52:54.839
It was damaged,
but he's doing what he can.

52:54.841 --> 52:57.741
At least we know Lonzo's in the
city with some kind of weapon.

52:57.743 --> 52:59.276
Yeah, but that means

52:59.278 --> 53:01.078
the attack's gonna happen soon.
- We don't even know

53:01.080 --> 53:03.113
what the target is or why
Barlow planned all this

53:03.115 --> 53:04.482
in the first place.

53:04.484 --> 53:06.350
We got to keep plugging
away until we do.

53:06.352 --> 53:09.520
All right, track the van down,
find more evidence,

53:09.522 --> 53:10.821
and stop the attack.
All right.

53:10.823 --> 53:13.023
And, look, no more
grand gestures, okay?

53:13.025 --> 53:15.726
Everything we do is
by the book from now on.

53:15.728 --> 53:16.927
Okay.

53:16.929 --> 53:19.630
Special Agent Lasalle,
someone's here for you.

53:25.838 --> 53:27.238
I'm Lasalle.

53:27.240 --> 53:30.474
Special Agent Silvera, IRS.
We need to talk.

53:30.476 --> 53:32.510
If this is about
a joint case with NCIS...

53:32.512 --> 53:34.278
This is about
a major tax fraud

53:34.280 --> 53:35.980
perpetrated by
your family's oil company.

53:35.982 --> 53:39.517
That's got to be Barlow
trying to distract us again.

53:39.519 --> 53:41.952
I don't know what that means,
but I've contacted

53:41.954 --> 53:44.188
NCIS Headquarters. They're
aware you're coming with me

53:44.190 --> 53:47.458
and it's not
up for debate.

53:47.460 --> 53:50.160
This is the part when we leave.

53:51.831 --> 53:53.297
Please.

53:54.767 --> 53:57.067
It's okay, all right?
I'll sort this out.

53:57.069 --> 53:59.570
You're in charge.
Find those suspects.

54:00.766 --> 54:03.307
We can't just sit back and
keep letting Barlow do...

54:03.309 --> 54:06.677
There's no "we" here, Sydney.
You're riding the bench.

54:08.214 --> 54:09.980
She's right.

54:09.982 --> 54:13.117
Barlow keeps chipping away
at the team. You need Dwayne.

54:13.119 --> 54:15.152
He got away with warning
the Navy about the attack.

54:15.154 --> 54:17.988
How are we gonna get him
back in the game?

54:19.859 --> 54:21.325
I may have an idea.

54:23.763 --> 54:26.864
<i>The place gets amazing light.</i>

54:26.866 --> 54:28.432
It's kind of perfect
for presenting evidence,

54:28.434 --> 54:30.000
even though I have
absolutely no idea

54:30.002 --> 54:31.669
why Doc Wade is having me do it

54:31.671 --> 54:33.571
in a room above a bar,
or who it's for.

54:33.573 --> 54:35.573
Yeah, Loretta didn't
tell you either, huh?

54:35.575 --> 54:37.341
No. Hey, do you think
I got time to pee?

54:37.343 --> 54:38.642
Public speaking kind of
makes me nervous.

54:38.644 --> 54:40.811
I'm the same way, Sebastian.

54:40.813 --> 54:44.381
And considering my full schedule
of events, I don't know

54:44.383 --> 54:46.050
if I should be relieved that
I've been summoned,

54:46.052 --> 54:48.352
or put out.

54:51.557 --> 54:53.557
Loretta called you, too?
And despite the fact

54:53.559 --> 54:56.694
that I shouldn't be
within 200 yards of you,

54:56.696 --> 54:59.930
Dwayne, we came.
Want to say why?

55:02.068 --> 55:04.335
Guessin' she wants us to talk.

55:04.337 --> 55:06.503
We're taking your warning
as seriously as we can

55:06.505 --> 55:08.572
considering there
are no specifics.

55:08.574 --> 55:09.907
There's more
to share now.

55:09.909 --> 55:11.809
Loretta, you told me

55:11.811 --> 55:13.978
I had to come. That it
was life and death.

55:13.980 --> 55:16.914
- It is.
- And that Dwayne wouldn't be here.

55:16.916 --> 55:18.582
Okay, well, that part was a lie.

55:18.584 --> 55:21.318
But, uh, look,
sandwiches.

55:21.320 --> 55:22.853
More interested
in evidence

55:22.855 --> 55:24.955
proving that Barlow
is a criminal mastermind.

55:24.957 --> 55:26.624
We don't have anything
admissible yet.

55:26.626 --> 55:28.892
But we can start
filling in the blanks

55:28.894 --> 55:31.362
on the suspects that
are working for him.

55:31.364 --> 55:33.063
Amelia Parsons--
she's employed

55:33.065 --> 55:34.832
by Connor and Hughes
as a consultant,

55:34.834 --> 55:37.368
which in this instance
translates to hired gun.

55:37.370 --> 55:38.902
This is the woman who
your Green Beret friend

55:38.904 --> 55:40.404
put in the hospital?

55:40.406 --> 55:42.940
Well, technically,
ex-Green Beret, and she...

55:42.942 --> 55:44.274
totally wasn't supposed
to kick her ass that bad,

55:44.276 --> 55:45.409
but that was...

55:45.411 --> 55:48.746
She did help us
track down this man,

55:48.748 --> 55:50.214
Lonzo Cortez, another hired gun.

55:50.216 --> 55:52.182
He and
Amelia were part

55:52.184 --> 55:55.552
of an arms deal this morning
that left the dealer dead

55:55.554 --> 55:56.754
and the weapons missing.

55:56.756 --> 55:58.188
What kind of weapons?

55:58.190 --> 56:00.190
Well, suspects
have four duffel bags.

56:00.192 --> 56:02.059
We don't know
what's inside them,

56:02.061 --> 56:03.727
but I did find traces
of aluminum paste

56:03.729 --> 56:05.829
and ammonium nitrate
at both crime scenes.

56:05.831 --> 56:08.232
Now that's a-a mixture commonly
used for the propulsion

56:08.234 --> 56:10.668
of rocket-propelled grenades.

56:10.670 --> 56:13.470
These guys have rockets?

56:13.472 --> 56:15.239
Any idea where
they're using them?

56:15.241 --> 56:17.374
No, they're driving
around in a van with no plates.

56:17.376 --> 56:18.809
Uh, we did retrieve

56:18.811 --> 56:20.978
some damaged hard drives here.
We-we couldn't pull much data,

56:20.980 --> 56:23.914
apart from some forged
document templates.

56:23.916 --> 56:26.617
Boat slip permits,
TWIC cards.

56:26.619 --> 56:29.119
Attack's coming
from the river, soon.

56:29.121 --> 56:31.288
Unless we work together
to stop it.

56:31.290 --> 56:33.657
Patton is searching
a citywide grid

56:33.659 --> 56:34.825
of surveillance cameras
for the van,

56:34.827 --> 56:36.593
but, man, it's a lot
of ground to cover.

56:36.595 --> 56:38.796
I'll put BOLOs out
for the van and Lonzo Cortez.

56:38.798 --> 56:43.133
And I will personally coordinate
a search of the river.

56:43.135 --> 56:45.836
Anything you need
to stop these men.

56:45.838 --> 56:47.604
What I need is
to be out there, too.

56:47.606 --> 56:51.041
Navy and DOJ made it clear
you're persona non grata.

56:51.043 --> 56:55.713
Because Eric Barlow bent over
backwards to set him up.

56:55.715 --> 56:57.014
There's a reason
he doesn't want me

56:57.016 --> 56:58.816
on the street.

56:58.818 --> 57:01.485
Still don't know what it is,
but it cost Carl Estes his life.

57:01.487 --> 57:02.953
And that's
reason enough

57:02.955 --> 57:05.155
for me to want
to get back out there.

57:06.859 --> 57:08.826
He's right.

57:09.995 --> 57:12.296
We need him on this one.

57:12.298 --> 57:14.598
You'll ride
with me, Pride.

57:14.600 --> 57:16.467
It'll be an honor.

57:17.937 --> 57:20.204
<i>I honestly don't know</i>
<i>what the problem is.</i>

57:20.206 --> 57:22.473
Have a seat
and I'll tell you.

57:22.475 --> 57:23.874
Look, I really
don't have time.

57:23.876 --> 57:26.376
Feels like we already had
this conversation.

57:26.378 --> 57:28.278
You say you
need to leave,

57:28.280 --> 57:30.748
I say you need to stay,
rinse, repeat.

57:30.750 --> 57:32.883
Just sit.

57:32.885 --> 57:34.918
Please.

57:34.920 --> 57:37.888
I've been overseeing my father's
company for six months.

57:37.890 --> 57:39.389
Didn't get a letter
or a phone call

57:39.391 --> 57:41.358
about any tax issues.

57:41.360 --> 57:44.027
This isn't a "send a letter,
make a call" kind of situation.

57:44.029 --> 57:45.996
This is a "ten agents
working 'round the clock"

57:45.998 --> 57:47.598
kind of situation.

57:47.600 --> 57:49.366
And so...

57:49.368 --> 57:51.235
your chair.

57:52.805 --> 57:55.773
You look me in the eye
and tell me Eric Barlow

57:55.775 --> 57:58.375
isn't pulling the strings
on this whole deal.

58:00.045 --> 58:03.380
I honestly have no idea
who Eric Barlow is.

58:03.382 --> 58:06.550
Now, sit down...

58:06.552 --> 58:08.952
please.

58:10.890 --> 58:13.624
Thinkin' your definition
of that word "please"

58:13.626 --> 58:16.026
is different than mine.

58:16.028 --> 58:18.395
Thank you.

58:18.397 --> 58:19.797
Let's start from the beginning.

58:19.799 --> 58:22.266
These are your
company's tax returns

58:22.268 --> 58:24.802
from the years 2013
to 2017.

58:27.306 --> 58:29.106
<i>What?</i>
<i>Still no answer from Lasalle?</i>

58:29.108 --> 58:32.075
No. And with Pride helping NOPD
search for the suspects,

58:32.077 --> 58:33.744
we're all that's left
to hold down the fort.

58:33.746 --> 58:36.013
Dynamic duo, back at it.
What's she doing?

58:36.015 --> 58:38.549
<i>She</i> is making
herself useful.

58:38.551 --> 58:40.150
Yeah, Patton and I are
still going through

58:40.152 --> 58:41.685
city traffic cams
trying to find the van.

58:41.687 --> 58:43.554
That means there's no one
left to go through the rest

58:43.556 --> 58:45.889
of the files that we took
from Connor and Hughes.

58:45.891 --> 58:48.325
So you put a civilian on
an official NCIS computer

58:48.327 --> 58:50.194
to examine highly
sensitive data?

58:50.196 --> 58:51.528
I've still got my
top secret clearance.

58:51.530 --> 58:52.596
Oh, in that case,

58:52.598 --> 58:53.597
I guess we're good.

58:53.599 --> 58:54.698
Barlow set Pride up
to take the fall.

58:54.700 --> 58:55.799
He's doing the same
to Lasalle.

58:55.801 --> 58:57.501
Yeah, well, we have

58:57.503 --> 58:59.002
an active terror
threat in the city.

58:59.004 --> 59:00.904
There's absolutely no one
that can get Lasalle released?

59:00.906 --> 59:03.073
I've called anyone I can think
of who might have pull enough

59:03.075 --> 59:04.741
to get him released--
NCIS Headquarters,

59:04.743 --> 59:06.777
Isler, Rita.
No one can help.

59:06.779 --> 59:08.879
- It's crazy.
- When the IRS wants you got,

59:08.881 --> 59:12.182
you're got-- that's why I only
deal in crypto-currency.

59:12.184 --> 59:14.017
Aren't you supposed to be
in D.C. right now

59:14.019 --> 59:15.853
with Rita digging up dirt
on Barlow?

59:15.855 --> 59:17.521
Oh, I've been.
We've dug. I'm back.

59:17.523 --> 59:18.922
You're not safe here.

59:18.924 --> 59:21.291
Well, I'm an
investigative reporter,

59:21.293 --> 59:22.492
so danger is
my baseline.

59:22.494 --> 59:25.295
You run a glorified gossip site.
Hey.

59:25.297 --> 59:27.798
We're all supposed to be on
the same side now, remember?

59:27.800 --> 59:29.099
Don't be hurtful.

59:29.101 --> 59:31.134
Plus, I come bearing gifts.

59:31.136 --> 59:33.470
Everything Eric Barlow doesn't
want you to know about him.

59:33.472 --> 59:35.505
Gonna have to wait.
I found the van.

59:35.507 --> 59:37.107
But we got a big problem.

59:38.510 --> 59:42.279
I was able to track the van to
a security cam near the river.

59:42.281 --> 59:44.181
That's the Patterson
Street Mooring Station.

59:44.183 --> 59:45.482
That's a few miles
upriver from Fleet Week.

59:45.484 --> 59:47.417
Got there about an hour ago.

59:47.419 --> 59:48.518
You get an image
of who's inside?

59:48.520 --> 59:50.020
Yeah. That's where
we got a problem.

59:53.058 --> 59:55.225
Oh, my God.

59:57.897 --> 01:00:00.464
Talked to my Harbor Patrol guy.
He can be trusted,

01:00:00.466 --> 01:00:01.999
but the less he knows about you,
the better.

01:00:02.001 --> 01:00:03.901
For his own protection.
Yeah.

01:00:03.903 --> 01:00:05.014
I'll let you know when
you need to board.

01:00:05.038 --> 01:00:07.005
Thanks.

01:00:09.008 --> 01:00:10.607
What's up, New York?

01:00:10.609 --> 01:00:13.010
Hey, uh, we need you alone
for what we have to say.

01:00:13.012 --> 01:00:13.594
Go ahead.

01:00:13.618 --> 01:00:14.879
We just got
security footage of the van.

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:18.215
I just texted you
a screenshot of the suspect.

01:00:18.217 --> 01:00:19.383
You're not gonna like it.

01:00:25.424 --> 01:00:27.324
He's not just setting you up
for police misconduct.

01:00:27.326 --> 01:00:30.427
He's setting me up to take
the fall for this attack.

01:00:47.363 --> 01:00:48.072
Hang on.

01:00:48.073 --> 01:00:50.105
Time stamp shows this image
was taken an hour ago.

01:00:50.107 --> 01:00:52.141
I was nowhere near the river.

01:00:52.143 --> 01:00:54.143
Barlow's people were able to
hack into the security cam

01:00:54.145 --> 01:00:55.477
and doctor the footage.

01:00:55.479 --> 01:00:56.512
Yeah, it's called Deepfake.

01:00:56.514 --> 01:00:58.047
It uses artificial intelligence

01:00:58.049 --> 01:01:00.549
to replace one person's face
with another.

01:01:00.551 --> 01:01:02.384
It's almost impossible to detect
anything's been manipulated.

01:01:02.386 --> 01:01:04.353
- You're gonna have to try.
- I'm working on

01:01:04.355 --> 01:01:05.988
reverse-engineering it,
but it'll take a while.

01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:08.724
Until then, we need
you back at NCIS.

01:01:08.726 --> 01:01:10.292
Well, I'm not gonna hide
while the real suspect's

01:01:10.294 --> 01:01:11.760
on the water
with those RPGs.

01:01:11.762 --> 01:01:13.529
Pride, we're the only ones

01:01:13.531 --> 01:01:15.497
who have this footage right now,
if any other agency gets it,

01:01:15.499 --> 01:01:17.166
it's just...
- Yeah, the target on my back gets bigger.

01:01:17.168 --> 01:01:19.068
I understand the stakes.

01:01:19.070 --> 01:01:20.510
It's not stopping you,
though, is it?

01:01:21.205 --> 01:01:23.172
Keep working. Learn more.

01:01:23.174 --> 01:01:26.075
Keep my head down best as I can.

01:01:26.077 --> 01:01:27.309
Everything okay?

01:01:27.311 --> 01:01:30.045
Yeah, just my team.

01:01:31.649 --> 01:01:34.116
Suspect's already on the river.

01:01:34.118 --> 01:01:36.251
Then let's go find him.

01:01:39.623 --> 01:01:41.957
<i>I don't like it one bit.</i>

01:01:41.959 --> 01:01:44.693
- Pride's a sitting duck out there.
- I don't like it either, Sebastian.

01:01:44.695 --> 01:01:46.562
But Pride's gonna do Pride,
but we need more evidence

01:01:46.564 --> 01:01:48.464
to shut Barlow down.
Then I'm the guy

01:01:48.466 --> 01:01:49.932
that's gonna make
your dreams come true,

01:01:49.934 --> 01:01:51.867
'cause I got Barlow
in my crosshairs.

01:01:51.869 --> 01:01:53.902
I have something so salacious,
it's gonna take him right to his knees.

01:01:53.904 --> 01:01:56.705
- Enough with the sales pitch, Crane. Spill.
- Okay.

01:01:56.707 --> 01:01:58.907
So, St. Claude's Academy,

01:01:58.909 --> 01:02:00.476
Manchester, New Hampshire.

01:02:00.478 --> 01:02:02.044
One of the oldest boarding
schools in the country.

01:02:02.046 --> 01:02:03.479
And it was
almost taken down

01:02:03.481 --> 01:02:06.415
by a massive
cheating scandal.

01:02:06.417 --> 01:02:08.484
Cheating high school students?
That's what you got?

01:02:08.486 --> 01:02:10.052
Well, not just high
school students.

01:02:10.054 --> 01:02:12.388
Sons of some of the most
prominent families.

01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:15.257
Four of the top five
highest achieving seniors

01:02:15.259 --> 01:02:17.659
in Barlow's class were
expelled for turning in

01:02:17.661 --> 01:02:19.962
plagiarized term papers and
cheating on final exams.

01:02:19.964 --> 01:02:23.232
That's not salacious;
that's not even, like, naughty.

01:02:23.234 --> 01:02:25.334
Yeah, except the scandal
was a setup.

01:02:25.336 --> 01:02:28.837
Those boys were framed,
just like Pride.

01:02:28.839 --> 01:02:31.273
Why would Barlow do that?
Because he was the fifth

01:02:31.275 --> 01:02:32.808
highest achieving student

01:02:32.810 --> 01:02:35.444
until all of his
competition was removed.

01:02:35.446 --> 01:02:37.980
It's like the fireman
who sets the fire

01:02:37.982 --> 01:02:39.782
to heroically put out
the flames, take the credit.

01:02:39.784 --> 01:02:41.216
Yeah, and it's not
the only time it's happened.

01:02:41.218 --> 01:02:43.652
He made Law Review, he clerked
for the Supreme Court.

01:02:43.654 --> 01:02:45.854
He was appointed number
three spot at Justice,

01:02:45.856 --> 01:02:47.256
all on the backs
of his rivals.

01:02:47.258 --> 01:02:48.791
Barlow's setting up
the attack on Fleet Week

01:02:48.793 --> 01:02:51.126
because he wants to be
the one to help stop it.

01:02:51.128 --> 01:02:52.694
Yeah, he's gonna get
national exposure--

01:02:52.696 --> 01:02:54.430
any opportunity he wants,
like, oh, I don't know,

01:02:54.432 --> 01:02:56.265
for instance,
governor of Louisiana.

01:02:56.267 --> 01:02:57.800
It's a good theory
but we still don't know

01:02:57.802 --> 01:03:00.602
where this attack
is gonna be.

01:03:00.604 --> 01:03:02.471
Actually, I might.

01:03:04.275 --> 01:03:07.609
I've been sorting through the
data Amelia had on Fleet Week

01:03:07.611 --> 01:03:10.179
and realized
it's a waste of time.

01:03:10.181 --> 01:03:11.547
Or it's called police work.

01:03:11.549 --> 01:03:13.282
I started thinking
strategically.

01:03:13.284 --> 01:03:16.318
If the suspects are gonna
risk attacking Fleet Week,

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:19.021
they want the most
bang for their buck.

01:03:19.023 --> 01:03:22.691
Yeah, something high-profile,
chock-full of VIPs.

01:03:22.693 --> 01:03:25.060
There's a reception today
on the deck

01:03:25.062 --> 01:03:26.762
of the USS <i>Kearsarge.</i>

01:03:26.764 --> 01:03:29.031
Official commemoration of
the New Orleans Tricentennial.

01:03:29.033 --> 01:03:30.265
Hottest ticket in town.

01:03:30.267 --> 01:03:33.669
Admirals, generals, politicians,
foreign dignitaries,

01:03:33.671 --> 01:03:35.237
it's a turkey shoot.

01:03:35.239 --> 01:03:36.205
Wade's gonna
be there, too.

01:03:36.207 --> 01:03:37.172
She's gonna be with Mayor Taylor

01:03:37.174 --> 01:03:38.273
when she presents
the key to the city

01:03:38.275 --> 01:03:39.408
to the Navy
and the Marine Corps.

01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:40.609
When's this reception start?

01:03:40.611 --> 01:03:41.877
20 minutes ago.

01:03:44.248 --> 01:03:45.814
<i>This is all a setup.</i>

01:03:45.816 --> 01:03:47.316
Here we go again.
Eric Barlow

01:03:47.318 --> 01:03:50.185
is trying to distract
every member of my team.

01:03:50.187 --> 01:03:52.087
Because of some
massive conspiracy.

01:03:52.089 --> 01:03:53.222
Yes, you've said.

01:03:53.224 --> 01:03:55.691
Multiple times.

01:03:55.693 --> 01:03:57.059
Look into it.

01:03:57.061 --> 01:03:59.027
This case was referred to you.

01:03:59.029 --> 01:04:00.896
Maybe not by Eric Barlow
himself,

01:04:00.898 --> 01:04:02.698
but someone at Justice

01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:04.867
put these wheels in motion.

01:04:04.869 --> 01:04:07.336
You want facts?

01:04:07.338 --> 01:04:10.672
I was told to pursue
Lasalle Enterprises. Fact.

01:04:10.674 --> 01:04:14.209
And there was something
to pursue.

01:04:14.211 --> 01:04:16.411
Another fact?

01:04:16.413 --> 01:04:18.747
You have to take it
seriously.

01:04:20.518 --> 01:04:23.051
And that means not checking your
cell phone every five minutes.

01:04:23.053 --> 01:04:25.787
Look, I am taking it seriously.

01:04:25.789 --> 01:04:27.122
And I've heard you out.

01:04:27.124 --> 01:04:29.458
Now I need to go.
My team needs me.

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:31.593
This is not a problem
that goes away.

01:04:31.595 --> 01:04:33.729
No matter what crisis
you're rushing to,

01:04:33.731 --> 01:04:34.763
if you don't pay attention

01:04:34.765 --> 01:04:36.064
to the one
that's right in front of you,

01:04:36.066 --> 01:04:37.306
your family business goes down.

01:04:38.636 --> 01:04:40.636
And you go down with it.

01:04:57.188 --> 01:04:59.855
Got a report
from the Coast Guard.

01:04:59.857 --> 01:05:01.957
Unidentified speedboat
a few miles downriver

01:05:01.959 --> 01:05:03.392
moving in the direction
of the <i>Kearsarge.</i>

01:05:03.394 --> 01:05:04.393
That could be Lonzo.

01:05:04.395 --> 01:05:06.528
We should check
it out, yeah?

01:05:06.530 --> 01:05:08.730
Let's say we do not intercept
this boat.

01:05:08.732 --> 01:05:11.633
The Navy and the Coast Guard
are prepared for this scenario.

01:05:11.635 --> 01:05:14.203
They have a security zone.
Any vessel that gets inside

01:05:14.205 --> 01:05:16.939
will be detained or just simply
blown out of the water.

01:05:16.941 --> 01:05:19.875
The RPGs he's carrying
have long-range warheads.

01:05:19.877 --> 01:05:22.244
Even if he fired one
from outside the zone,

01:05:22.246 --> 01:05:23.912
it could cause
massive damage.

01:05:23.914 --> 01:05:25.380
And if we do find him first,

01:05:25.382 --> 01:05:27.482
he could use
those rockets on us.

01:05:27.484 --> 01:05:30.586
I'd say it's a
strong possibility.

01:05:44.401 --> 01:05:46.401
Hey, Lasalle!

01:05:46.403 --> 01:05:48.971
Finally convinced that
IRS agent to release you?

01:05:48.973 --> 01:05:50.272
I don't think
she sees it that way.

01:05:50.274 --> 01:05:52.274
Get yourself in more trouble?

01:05:52.276 --> 01:05:54.176
Well, that doesn't matter.
We got to warn the Navy

01:05:54.178 --> 01:05:55.477
that <i>Kearsarge</i>
is the target.

01:05:55.479 --> 01:05:56.778
Won't be easy

01:05:56.780 --> 01:05:58.447
after Pride confronted them
this morning.

01:05:58.449 --> 01:06:00.115
All right, you need to look for
Captain Deckard. He's in charge.

01:06:00.117 --> 01:06:01.350
I'll look for Mayor Taylor.

01:06:01.352 --> 01:06:02.884
You got it.

01:06:04.855 --> 01:06:06.655
I know I'm not on the
guest list, but this is urgent.

01:06:06.657 --> 01:06:08.957
I'm looking for Mayor Taylor.
Sure, let me check that for you.

01:06:08.959 --> 01:06:10.926
Mayor isn't here yet.

01:06:10.928 --> 01:06:13.795
Guest of honor, after all,
has to make an entrance,

01:06:13.797 --> 01:06:14.997
but she should be here soon.

01:06:14.999 --> 01:06:19.001
Gives us a chance to chat.

01:06:19.003 --> 01:06:20.902
I'd like to pick
your brain.

01:06:25.542 --> 01:06:28.143
You're Dwayne
Pride's man, right?

01:06:28.145 --> 01:06:30.012
He already warned
us of the threat.

01:06:30.014 --> 01:06:33.615
I've got new information.
This ship is the target.

01:06:33.617 --> 01:06:35.083
The <i>Kearsarge</i>
is the most secure spot

01:06:35.085 --> 01:06:37.085
in the Southern United States
right now.

01:06:37.087 --> 01:06:38.387
It doesn't change the fact
that there's at least

01:06:38.389 --> 01:06:40.055
one suspect out there
with long-range rockets

01:06:40.057 --> 01:06:41.156
heading this way.

01:06:41.158 --> 01:06:43.125
We did get a report from NOPD

01:06:43.127 --> 01:06:44.393
of an unauthorized boat
in the area.

01:06:44.395 --> 01:06:46.228
Yeah, the threat
is very real.

01:06:46.230 --> 01:06:47.496
All right? We need to act now.

01:06:47.498 --> 01:06:48.897
Well,

01:06:48.899 --> 01:06:50.132
then you're gonna need
to be more open with me

01:06:50.134 --> 01:06:51.133
than your boss was.

01:06:51.135 --> 01:06:52.734
How the hell do
you know all this?

01:06:52.736 --> 01:06:54.136
Security alert from NOPD.

01:06:54.138 --> 01:06:56.038
Suspect van was flagged
gaining access

01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:57.205
to the river two hours ago.

01:06:57.207 --> 01:06:58.874
We got photos.

01:06:58.876 --> 01:07:00.742
I need to explain
what you're about to see.

01:07:00.744 --> 01:07:03.945
This photo speaks for itself,
Special Agent Lasalle.

01:07:05.849 --> 01:07:07.883
That's Dwayne Pride.

01:07:13.791 --> 01:07:15.357
Photo's doctored.

01:07:15.359 --> 01:07:16.992
I know it, Dwayne.

01:07:16.994 --> 01:07:18.960
Problem is, no
one else will.

01:07:18.962 --> 01:07:21.029
Every law
enforcement agency

01:07:21.031 --> 01:07:22.931
has instructions to take
you down, dead or alive.

01:07:22.933 --> 01:07:26.401
Considering they think I'm about
to blow a hole in a Navy ship.

01:07:26.403 --> 01:07:28.236
My guy got word that
the speedboat we're looking for

01:07:28.238 --> 01:07:29.404
is heading straight
for the <i>Kearsarge.</i>

01:07:29.406 --> 01:07:30.605
We're on our way.

01:07:30.607 --> 01:07:32.274
We'll clear your name.

01:07:32.276 --> 01:07:33.809
Doesn't make sense, Cedric.

01:07:35.546 --> 01:07:37.145
Barlow put a lot of effort
into framing me.

01:07:37.147 --> 01:07:39.281
How do I take the fall

01:07:39.283 --> 01:07:41.049
if I'm on a Harbor Patrol boat?

01:07:41.051 --> 01:07:42.784
Well, maybe he figures

01:07:42.786 --> 01:07:44.019
in the confusion
of the attack...

01:07:44.021 --> 01:07:46.788
No, no, he wouldn't leave it
to chance.

01:07:46.790 --> 01:07:49.725
For his plan to work, I got
to be found with those RPGs.

01:07:49.727 --> 01:07:52.027
He could've anticipated
you'd be with me.

01:07:52.029 --> 01:07:54.363
We're heading straight
for the <i>Kearsarge,</i>

01:07:54.365 --> 01:07:57.899
right at the moment the attack's
supposed to take place.

01:07:57.901 --> 01:08:01.236
Like you said,
the only way to stop it.

01:08:08.746 --> 01:08:12.280
There is no speedboat, is there?

01:08:13.751 --> 01:08:16.785
Nope.

01:08:16.787 --> 01:08:19.821
The RPGs?

01:08:19.823 --> 01:08:22.791
They're in the cabinet
behind you.

01:08:31.935 --> 01:08:33.801
Cedric.

01:08:35.072 --> 01:08:36.638
Estes always
said you were too clever.

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:38.340
Doesn't matter now.

01:08:40.010 --> 01:08:42.210
Don't try to answer your phone,
Dwayne.

01:08:42.212 --> 01:08:45.279
And don't even think about
reaching for your weapon.

01:08:45.282 --> 01:08:46.782
We still need you alive...

01:08:46.783 --> 01:08:48.617
for at least
a little bit longer.

01:09:14.207 --> 01:09:15.738
Gonna keep this real simple.

01:09:16.169 --> 01:09:18.303
You get on your knees.

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:23.642
We get closer to
the riverbank...

01:09:23.644 --> 01:09:25.743
I'll end this.

01:09:27.648 --> 01:09:29.147
Why the hell are you doing this?

01:09:29.149 --> 01:09:30.849
You've served the city
of New Orleans

01:09:30.850 --> 01:09:32.017
for 20 years.

01:09:32.019 --> 01:09:33.251
And I'll keep serving,

01:09:33.252 --> 01:09:34.486
doing what's right for the city,

01:09:34.488 --> 01:09:36.587
including this,
no matter the cost.

01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:38.622
Killing your own? That's
what's right for the city?

01:09:38.625 --> 01:09:40.558
You want to make a difference
in New Orleans?

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:42.794
You want to bring her back
to where she was?

01:09:42.796 --> 01:09:45.063
You need strong, dedicated men

01:09:45.064 --> 01:09:47.265
making the hard decisions.
Eric Barlow?

01:09:47.267 --> 01:09:49.134
His family's run this city
one way or the other

01:09:49.136 --> 01:09:50.335
for a hundred years.

01:09:50.337 --> 01:09:53.505
By bribing, killing,
blackmailing.

01:09:53.506 --> 01:09:55.540
This is a war.

01:09:55.542 --> 01:09:57.208
And there are sides.

01:09:57.210 --> 01:09:58.410
You picked yours.

01:09:58.412 --> 01:09:59.811
And I picked mine.

01:09:59.813 --> 01:10:01.446
Lonzo!

01:10:01.448 --> 01:10:04.349
To win this war,
you're gonna fire a rocket

01:10:04.351 --> 01:10:06.718
- at a Navy ship?
- No, Dwayne.

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:09.788
You're gonna fire a rocket.

01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:11.623
I'm gonna stop you.

01:10:14.928 --> 01:10:18.430
Here's his weapon.

01:10:18.432 --> 01:10:20.098
What's the plan here?

01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:22.200
I'm still being held
on a Harbor Patrol boat.

01:10:22.202 --> 01:10:25.437
This works...

01:10:25.439 --> 01:10:27.539
because you just took
my boat hostage

01:10:27.541 --> 01:10:29.607
and shot me.

01:10:39.086 --> 01:10:41.786
Damn it, that freaking hurts.

01:10:43.824 --> 01:10:47.525
All right, get ready.
We won't have much time.

01:10:47.527 --> 01:10:49.394
This is insanity.

01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:54.966
Mayday, Mayday.

01:10:54.968 --> 01:10:57.502
<i>This is NOPD</i>
<i>Deputy Chief Gossett.</i>

01:10:57.504 --> 01:11:01.773
My Harbor Patrol boat, D7-35,
has been hijacked

01:11:01.775 --> 01:11:04.042
by Dwayne Pride.
He's got rockets

01:11:04.044 --> 01:11:05.944
and he's heading straight
for the <i>Kearsarge.</i>

01:11:05.946 --> 01:11:08.546
We need to get all non-military
personnel below deck.

01:11:08.548 --> 01:11:10.815
- Immediately. Do it fast. But quietly.
- Aye, sir.

01:11:10.817 --> 01:11:12.851
I got two MSST units
geared and ready,

01:11:12.853 --> 01:11:15.553
plus a helo with a sniper team
lifting off in 90 seconds.

01:11:15.555 --> 01:11:18.089
Look, this is a frame job.
Let's take a moment here.

01:11:18.091 --> 01:11:20.225
Damn it, Agent, there
are no more moments.

01:11:20.227 --> 01:11:21.860
We have photos of your boss

01:11:21.862 --> 01:11:24.395
literally driving a van
full of RPGs to the river.

01:11:24.397 --> 01:11:26.097
And my team can prove
that they are doctored.

01:11:26.099 --> 01:11:28.066
Yeah, and the distress call.
That doctored, too?

01:11:28.068 --> 01:11:30.168
Gossett must be part
of the conspiracy.

01:11:30.170 --> 01:11:32.370
He's a decorated NOPD commander.

01:11:32.372 --> 01:11:34.305
And Dwayne Pride
is the only person

01:11:34.307 --> 01:11:36.541
who's been trying to stop
this attack from the beginning.

01:11:36.543 --> 01:11:39.511
He's saved the city, the mayor,
multiple times.

01:11:39.513 --> 01:11:42.347
It has to earn
some good faith.

01:11:42.349 --> 01:11:45.483
Despite your belief
in Dwayne Pride,

01:11:45.485 --> 01:11:47.552
I have to assume this is
exactly what it seems.

01:11:47.554 --> 01:11:49.687
Got to cover that
patrol boat fast.

01:11:49.689 --> 01:11:51.156
Take it out, take it down

01:11:51.158 --> 01:11:52.657
the minute it's in range.
I'm on it, Captain.

01:11:52.659 --> 01:11:55.026
Let's roll.
Aye, sir.

01:11:55.028 --> 01:11:56.661
All passengers,
please clear the flight deck.

01:11:56.663 --> 01:11:58.563
Say what you want

01:11:58.565 --> 01:12:00.131
about the military,

01:12:00.133 --> 01:12:01.666
they certainly know
how to keep their heads

01:12:01.668 --> 01:12:03.301
during dire situations.

01:12:03.303 --> 01:12:04.702
Say the same about you,

01:12:04.704 --> 01:12:06.504
but you know exactly
what's about to happen.

01:12:06.506 --> 01:12:08.640
You impress me,
Special Agent Gregorio.

01:12:08.642 --> 01:12:09.834
Smart, ambitious...

01:12:09.858 --> 01:12:11.477
You know you're going
down tonight, right?

01:12:11.478 --> 01:12:13.444
Ballsy, too.

01:12:13.446 --> 01:12:16.114
If there's
any criticism at all,

01:12:16.116 --> 01:12:18.316
it's of your choice of mentors.

01:12:18.318 --> 01:12:20.385
That dry drunk Isler.

01:12:20.387 --> 01:12:22.053
And Dwayne Pride,

01:12:22.055 --> 01:12:24.455
the perpetual martyr.
What does that make you?

01:12:24.457 --> 01:12:27.025
The winner.
Hmm.

01:12:27.027 --> 01:12:29.227
This city, the state,
they're mine.

01:12:29.229 --> 01:12:31.563
And that's just the beginning.

01:12:32.799 --> 01:12:34.566
I have to take this call.

01:12:34.568 --> 01:12:36.835
Good luck to you though.

01:12:36.837 --> 01:12:39.904
Yeah?

01:12:41.708 --> 01:12:43.575
Sebastian,
something's not right.

01:12:43.577 --> 01:12:45.310
Oh, you can single out
just one thing?

01:12:45.312 --> 01:12:46.678
'Cause where we're sitting,

01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:47.979
it's all hitting the fan.

01:12:47.981 --> 01:12:49.214
Gossett's
in on the conspiracy, okay?

01:12:49.216 --> 01:12:51.416
He's claiming that Pride
just took him hostage.

01:12:51.418 --> 01:12:53.318
Which means the frame job
is almost complete.

01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:54.419
That's what's bothering me.

01:12:54.421 --> 01:12:55.720
Barlow's standing 20 feet
from me

01:12:55.722 --> 01:12:57.922
at what's supposed to be
the ground zero of the attack.

01:12:57.924 --> 01:13:00.191
He wouldn't allow himself
to be put in harm's way.

01:13:00.193 --> 01:13:01.593
What are we missing?

01:13:02.529 --> 01:13:04.696
Attack's supposed to fail.

01:13:04.698 --> 01:13:06.364
Yeah, but there's got to be
some kind of meaningful damage.

01:13:06.366 --> 01:13:08.366
Otherwise, Barlow's not making
the national news.

01:13:08.368 --> 01:13:10.602
All right.
Mayor Taylor hasn't arrived yet.

01:13:10.604 --> 01:13:12.971
I need to get her
on the phone now.

01:13:17.177 --> 01:13:18.943
You doing this for money,
Cedric?

01:13:18.945 --> 01:13:20.712
I'm in this for New Orleans.

01:13:20.714 --> 01:13:22.881
You think you're the only one
who cares about this city?

01:13:22.883 --> 01:13:26.451
Last person who said
those exact words

01:13:26.453 --> 01:13:27.952
was Hamilton.

01:13:27.954 --> 01:13:29.320
You see what happened to him?

01:13:29.322 --> 01:13:30.622
He couldn't get the job done.

01:13:30.624 --> 01:13:32.090
But you can?

01:13:32.959 --> 01:13:34.525
Story's gonna be what?

01:13:34.527 --> 01:13:36.461
"Dangerous ex-federal agent

01:13:36.463 --> 01:13:38.696
"with an axe to grind
hijacks your boat?

01:13:38.698 --> 01:13:41.065
Makes a statement
by blowing up a Navy ship"?

01:13:41.067 --> 01:13:43.568
Except, I'm gonna stop you
before too much damage is done.

01:13:43.570 --> 01:13:45.236
And then what?

01:13:45.238 --> 01:13:46.471
Chief of police?

01:13:46.473 --> 01:13:47.772
Dwayne.

01:13:47.774 --> 01:13:50.174
I'm aiming much higher.

01:13:50.176 --> 01:13:52.110
I'm gonna replace Mayor Taylor.

01:13:52.112 --> 01:13:55.647
Replace her?

01:14:01.321 --> 01:14:04.656
Motorcade's being stopped,
it's time!

01:14:29.382 --> 01:14:30.381
What's going on?

01:14:30.383 --> 01:14:32.483
Security alert
on the <i>Kearsarge,</i> ma'am.

01:14:32.485 --> 01:14:33.885
What kind of security alert?

01:14:33.887 --> 01:14:35.119
Not sure yet,
but we've been told

01:14:35.121 --> 01:14:36.621
to hold here until it's clear.

01:14:38.191 --> 01:14:39.857
Gregorio.

01:14:39.859 --> 01:14:41.192
What is happening?

01:14:41.194 --> 01:14:43.394
You and Mayor Taylor
are in danger.

01:14:43.396 --> 01:14:46.431
We know about the alert,
we're not on the <i>Kearsarge.</i>

01:14:46.433 --> 01:14:48.466
The <i>Kearsarge</i> isn't the target,
Mayor Taylor is.

01:14:48.468 --> 01:14:49.567
Get out of there now.

01:15:23.339 --> 01:15:24.939
All right.
This is it, Dwayne.

01:15:25.556 --> 01:15:27.356
Gonna need you on the...

01:15:33.397 --> 01:15:35.230
Now, Lonzo!

01:15:52.650 --> 01:15:54.950
Stay down, don't move.

01:15:56.821 --> 01:16:00.189
Your man just opened fire
on the mayor.

01:16:00.191 --> 01:16:03.058
She's safe, but he's done.

01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:05.561
Look, it's not Pride, all right?
It's Deputy Chief Gossett.

01:16:05.563 --> 01:16:06.996
- I'm telling you.
- Whoever it is better surrender,

01:16:06.998 --> 01:16:08.464
or they're gonna get lit up.

01:16:08.466 --> 01:16:09.965
MSST is 30 seconds out.

01:16:11.402 --> 01:16:12.601
Captain, wait!

01:16:12.603 --> 01:16:14.069
Wait, I got proof
Pride is innocent.

01:16:14.071 --> 01:16:15.437
Look, you're gonna
want to see it.

01:16:34.091 --> 01:16:38.594
This is the United States Coast
Guard, and you are surrounded.

01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:41.664
You will lie prone
on the ground,

01:16:41.666 --> 01:16:42.965
or we will fire.
It's over.

01:16:42.967 --> 01:16:44.600
Screw you, Dwayne!

01:16:44.602 --> 01:16:46.735
You have ten seconds to comply.

01:16:46.737 --> 01:16:48.137
You will lie prone
on the ground, now!

01:16:48.139 --> 01:16:52.441
Move slowly, show your hands.

01:16:52.443 --> 01:16:54.143
No, don't do it.
Don't do it!

01:17:00.818 --> 01:17:03.619
I'm Dwayne Pride!

01:17:03.621 --> 01:17:05.487
Both suspects are down.

01:17:05.489 --> 01:17:07.890
I'm complying
with your instructions.

01:17:07.892 --> 01:17:09.658
Hey, Pride, it's okay!

01:17:10.661 --> 01:17:12.294
Mayor Taylor?

01:17:12.296 --> 01:17:13.662
Mayor Taylor?

01:17:13.664 --> 01:17:14.997
She's safe.

01:17:14.999 --> 01:17:16.331
Nobody's hurt.

01:17:17.334 --> 01:17:19.034
Special Agent
Lasalle

01:17:19.036 --> 01:17:21.236
sends his regards.

01:17:28.045 --> 01:17:29.611
All right,
let's check for victims.

01:17:29.613 --> 01:17:30.813
Set up a triage area.

01:17:30.815 --> 01:17:31.914
Let's make sure
these people are safe.

01:17:31.916 --> 01:17:34.083
Yes, sir.
Hey, somebody find the mayor.

01:17:34.085 --> 01:17:36.685
The mayor's safe, along with
everyone who was with her.

01:17:36.687 --> 01:17:39.154
Ride's a little
messed up, though.

01:17:39.156 --> 01:17:41.090
That's a relief.

01:17:41.092 --> 01:17:42.524
Plan failed, Barlow.

01:17:42.526 --> 01:17:44.560
Your men are dead,
Pride's alive.

01:17:44.562 --> 01:17:47.529
He's telling the Coast Guard
right now, everything.

01:17:47.531 --> 01:17:49.832
He has his version.

01:17:49.834 --> 01:17:51.200
I will have mine.

01:17:51.202 --> 01:17:54.336
Let's see whose microphone
is bigger.

01:17:54.338 --> 01:17:56.839
You think you're walking away?

01:17:56.841 --> 01:18:00.209
Like I told you,
Special Agent Gregorio,

01:18:00.211 --> 01:18:02.277
I'm a winner.

01:18:19.630 --> 01:18:22.531
Waste of time,
shredding those documents.

01:18:22.533 --> 01:18:24.633
Already got what we need.

01:18:26.804 --> 01:18:28.604
Halliday, right?

01:18:28.606 --> 01:18:30.038
Pushing your luck,

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:32.474
breaking into my building twice.

01:18:34.478 --> 01:18:36.812
I think you're looking for this.

01:18:41.418 --> 01:18:42.918
Pride sent you here to kill me.

01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:44.987
Nobody sends me anywhere.

01:18:44.989 --> 01:18:46.421
And I'm not a murderer.

01:18:46.423 --> 01:18:47.923
That's your thing.

01:18:47.925 --> 01:18:49.758
But I do
owe Pride my life.

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.994
And I'm repaying
that debt tonight.

01:18:51.996 --> 01:18:54.830
Then you're gonna
force a confession?

01:18:54.832 --> 01:18:59.334
I can tell you, with great
authority, it won't hold up.

01:18:59.336 --> 01:19:02.237
You're acting like you've still
got moves left to play.

01:19:02.239 --> 01:19:04.907
I'm here to let you know
the game is over.

01:19:04.909 --> 01:19:06.608
You lose.

01:19:10.748 --> 01:19:12.080
An Internet article?

01:19:12.082 --> 01:19:13.482
An exposé.

01:19:13.484 --> 01:19:15.651
On you.

01:19:15.653 --> 01:19:18.387
Complete with a link
to Amelia's hard drive.

01:19:18.389 --> 01:19:20.722
Dropped 20 minutes ago,
thanks to Oliver Crane,

01:19:20.724 --> 01:19:23.025
and already 50,000 clicks.

01:19:23.027 --> 01:19:25.563
You think a smear campaign
will save Pride?

01:19:25.848 --> 01:19:28.615
The moment Justice
realizes he's the source...

01:19:28.617 --> 01:19:31.117
But he's not the source.

01:19:31.119 --> 01:19:32.252
I am.

01:19:32.254 --> 01:19:34.287
And no one will
ever talk to me,

01:19:34.289 --> 01:19:36.957
'cause I'm disappearing
into thin air.

01:19:36.959 --> 01:19:38.358
This is not the end.

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:39.526
No.

01:19:39.528 --> 01:19:40.994
It's the beginning.

01:19:40.996 --> 01:19:43.663
Every nasty detail of every
dirty deal you've ever brokered.

01:19:43.665 --> 01:19:45.632
And it'll keep leaking.

01:19:45.634 --> 01:19:48.101
Drip, drip, drip.

01:19:48.103 --> 01:19:49.803
You'll never recover.

01:19:50.839 --> 01:19:53.306
We can make a deal.

01:19:53.308 --> 01:19:58.278
This is your new reality.

01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:00.046
Unless you take charge.

01:20:00.048 --> 01:20:02.482
Make a bold choice.

01:20:02.484 --> 01:20:04.651
And disappear yourself.

01:20:08.423 --> 01:20:10.790
It's up to you.

01:20:40.656 --> 01:20:44.324
Give it up for Trombone Sam!

01:20:46.194 --> 01:20:49.029
Hey, I told you he'd make it!

01:20:49.031 --> 01:20:51.064
All right.

01:20:51.066 --> 01:20:54.301
Hey, man,
Sebastian gave even odds

01:20:54.303 --> 01:20:56.803
that your bail
would be revoked.

01:20:56.805 --> 01:20:59.039
Hold on, now, that wasn't
because of a lack of faith.

01:20:59.041 --> 01:21:01.274
That was just
my general, uh, neuroses.

01:21:01.276 --> 01:21:03.577
All right, well, let me, uh,
soothe your soul here,

01:21:03.579 --> 01:21:05.245
Sebastian, I'm a free man.

01:21:05.247 --> 01:21:07.013
Oh, not just free.

01:21:07.015 --> 01:21:08.949
Vindicated.
Yeah?

01:21:08.951 --> 01:21:11.985
All charges dropped,
badge reinstated.

01:21:11.987 --> 01:21:14.721
And a special commendation
from the City of New Orleans.

01:21:14.723 --> 01:21:17.057
Oh, I don't need
any commendations.

01:21:17.059 --> 01:21:18.959
Anything I did,
my team did, as well.

01:21:18.961 --> 01:21:20.093
Just glad to
have them all.

01:21:20.095 --> 01:21:22.329
So is the city.

01:21:22.331 --> 01:21:26.333
Wish I could stay, but I do have
a ballroom full of VIPs

01:21:26.335 --> 01:21:29.202
expecting some TLC, ASAP.

01:21:30.505 --> 01:21:32.939
Good night, y'all.
Hey, Zahra.

01:21:32.941 --> 01:21:34.240
Thank you.

01:21:34.242 --> 01:21:38.912
No. Thank you, Pride.

01:21:38.914 --> 01:21:41.147
Again.

01:21:43.685 --> 01:21:45.285
All right.

01:21:45.287 --> 01:21:47.721
- Hey, thank you, let's have a toast.
- To what?

01:21:47.723 --> 01:21:50.557
Friendship, victory,
surviving another case?

01:21:50.559 --> 01:21:52.692
Uh-uh, how about to Pride,

01:21:52.694 --> 01:21:54.461
moving back to NCIS
where he belongs.

01:21:54.463 --> 01:21:56.930
Hang on,
I don't know about that, P.

01:21:56.932 --> 01:21:58.598
I'm glad to have my badge back,

01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:01.935
but I'm kind of digging
the new venue upstairs.

01:22:01.937 --> 01:22:03.903
Thinking maybe with
a little effort,

01:22:03.905 --> 01:22:05.538
it could become a proper home.

01:22:05.540 --> 01:22:06.906
Then, let's drink to that.
All right.

01:22:06.908 --> 01:22:09.009
Yeah, well, we
can all drink

01:22:09.011 --> 01:22:10.410
to whatever y'all want to

01:22:10.412 --> 01:22:12.112
as soon as I change
out of these clothes.

01:22:12.114 --> 01:22:13.146
Come on, hurry up.
I will.

01:22:13.148 --> 01:22:14.848
I will.
We're thirsty.

01:22:14.850 --> 01:22:15.949
And sober.

01:22:15.951 --> 01:22:17.017
Oh, I already started.

01:22:17.019 --> 01:22:18.818
Hey. Where you been?

01:22:18.820 --> 01:22:20.453
Dealing with a crap storm.

01:22:20.455 --> 01:22:22.155
What crap storm,
haven't you heard?

01:22:22.157 --> 01:22:24.424
Everything is right
with the world again.

01:22:24.426 --> 01:22:27.260
Maybe in New Orleans, Triple P,
but not so much in Alabama.

01:22:27.262 --> 01:22:28.728
What, is this about the IRS?

01:22:28.730 --> 01:22:31.398
Yeah, Barlow told them to
investigate my family business.

01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:33.833
But what Silvera found
was very real.

01:22:33.835 --> 01:22:35.335
Company could be
in deep trouble.

01:22:35.337 --> 01:22:36.269
Oh, Christopher.

01:22:36.271 --> 01:22:37.303
I'll be on the road

01:22:37.305 --> 01:22:38.605
first thing in the morning.

01:22:38.607 --> 01:22:40.573
Wanted to see Pride before I go.

01:22:40.575 --> 01:22:42.008
Don't know how long
I'll be gone.

01:22:42.010 --> 01:22:43.877
Hey, stick around,
he'll be back.

01:22:43.879 --> 01:22:46.813
Yeah, and you know, whatever
happens, we got your back.
