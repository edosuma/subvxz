01:34.095 --> 01:36.389
Hey Donny, watch your eyes, man.

02:06.127 --> 02:08.154
Yo, Ben. You coming
to lunch or what?

02:08.253 --> 02:11.507
- No, I got to take my kid to the
doctor. - Okay. See you later.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.542
Hey, he's over here!

02:56.803 --> 02:59.080
Stupid son of a bitch!
What are you standing there for?

02:59.180 --> 03:02.183
You hear me you crazy bastard?
Come over here and help us!

03:02.392 --> 03:05.628
- What's the matter with you? - Leave
him alone! Let's take care of Ben!

03:05.728 --> 03:08.064
Yeah, let's take care of Ben.

03:08.606 --> 03:10.274
Take his visor off.

03:12.527 --> 03:14.070
Give me a hand here.

03:37.468 --> 03:40.179
You realize Ben nearly
died because of you?

03:42.223 --> 03:45.418
A man goes up in flames and you
stand there like a faggot.

03:45.518 --> 03:46.978
I'm not a faggot.

03:47.228 --> 03:49.422
- What?
- I'm not a faggot.

03:49.522 --> 03:51.507
It just covered.
It covered him up.

03:51.607 --> 03:54.135
He wasn't evil
but it covered him up.

03:54.235 --> 03:56.637
What are you talking about?
I covered Ben!

03:56.737 --> 04:00.450
No. The cover of flame.
The cover of the flame.

04:00.616 --> 04:02.410
You know you're crazy.

04:02.577 --> 04:04.354
I always said you were crazy.

04:04.454 --> 04:06.247
You stay away from me.

04:06.706 --> 04:08.499
You think I was afraid?

04:09.125 --> 04:10.918
You think I'm crazy?

04:11.085 --> 04:14.714
- What are you talking about?
- I would have helped him.

04:17.132 --> 04:19.427
You're a sicko.

04:43.159 --> 04:48.039
<i>Chief Daily, Line 91.
Chief Daily, pick up 91.</i>

04:50.500 --> 04:52.752
Hey, Donny.
Donny, wait a minute.

04:53.002 --> 04:54.921
Hey, let's go have a beer, man.

04:55.213 --> 04:57.448
No thanks, uh, I got to get home.

04:57.548 --> 05:00.159
Oh well, so do I. Let's go
have a beer anyway. Come on.

05:00.259 --> 05:03.721
- I can't. My mother's sick.
- Okay. But wait a minute, now listen.

05:03.850 --> 05:06.290
I don't want you to go home
thinking that was your fault, man,

05:06.390 --> 05:10.937
because I mean things can happen and a guy
can freeze in a situation like that, you know.

05:11.771 --> 05:13.381
- Hey, that's right.
- Yeah.

05:13.481 --> 05:14.882
That's right.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.717
He's the one that's sick.

05:16.817 --> 05:20.138
- He's the faggot, not me. - Yeah,
you're probably right about that.

05:20.238 --> 05:22.098
You know that's the
way those people are.

05:22.198 --> 05:26.727
- They call you names and they're the crazy ones.
- He's a lightweight. Don't worry about it.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.730
But that's the way it happened.
You're right, Bobby.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.910
- Hey, I froze. I couldn't do anything.
- Hey, you know, speaking of freezing,

05:33.000 --> 05:36.362
I'm gonna go find a nice warm barstool.
Why don't you come along, huh?

05:36.462 --> 05:38.422
Nah, I can't.

05:38.589 --> 05:40.992
Okay. Alright.
I'll see you tomorrow. Okay?

05:41.092 --> 05:43.052
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

06:14.375 --> 06:19.130
<i>(That's right. Go home. Go home
like a good boy. Mother's waiting.)</i>

06:46.991 --> 06:48.993
Mother, I'm home.

06:52.288 --> 06:54.498
I'll have your tea
ready in a minute.

07:22.068 --> 07:24.111
<i>(No, mother, don't.)</i>

08:11.784 --> 08:15.955
I made you camomile tea since you've
been trouble sleeping lately.

08:17.456 --> 08:19.959
There. It's nice and hot.

08:22.545 --> 08:25.589
Oh You're already asleep.

08:27.216 --> 08:28.743
Don't you want your tea?

08:28.843 --> 08:30.469
I made your tea.

08:31.971 --> 08:33.304
Mother?

08:33.889 --> 08:35.975
Mother, are you all right?

08:37.308 --> 08:38.644
Mother?

09:01.792 --> 09:03.085
No.

09:03.502 --> 09:04.820
Wake up.

09:04.920 --> 09:07.423
Mother wake up!

09:07.840 --> 09:09.700
Please wake up.

09:09.800 --> 09:12.970
Please wake up, Mother!

09:29.320 --> 09:31.864
What am I going to do now?

09:32.490 --> 09:34.241
It's not true.

09:34.492 --> 09:35.910
It's not...

09:38.078 --> 09:39.789
She's gonna wake up.

09:40.873 --> 09:42.583
She's just asleep.

09:43.334 --> 09:44.877
Last asleep.

09:46.212 --> 09:48.047
She's gonna wake up soon.

09:48.339 --> 09:50.049
No! Come on!

09:50.466 --> 09:51.967
Wake up!

09:52.635 --> 09:55.496
Now stop it!
I made your tea!

09:55.596 --> 09:57.431
Drink your tea!

09:57.598 --> 09:59.458
<i>(She was evil. Evil.)</i>

09:59.558 --> 10:03.771
<i>(Now you're free. You're not afraid.
You don't have to be afraid.)</i>

10:03.938 --> 10:06.090
<i>(You're not alone. We're here.)</i>

10:06.190 --> 10:07.842
<i>(We're here to help you.)</i>

10:07.942 --> 10:10.194
<i>(You're free now. You're free.)</i>

10:10.569 --> 10:12.738
<i>(You can do anything you want to.)</i>

Free?

10:14.698 --> 10:17.535
<i>(We'll help you. Don't worry.
We'll help you.)</i>

You will?

10:19.495 --> 10:21.789
<i>(You can do anything
you want to do.)</i>

10:21.956 --> 10:23.666
<i>(Now you're free.)</i>

10:23.833 --> 10:25.835
Can I play my music loud?

10:26.043 --> 10:29.922
<i>(giggles)</i>

10:40.307 --> 10:57.408
(loud playing "Late
Night Surrender")

11:31.191 --> 11:37.740
(music continuous)

12:00.304 --> 12:03.098
Donald! Don't you dare!

12:15.319 --> 12:20.783
(music continuous)

12:27.414 --> 12:29.024
<i>(She's still dead.)</i>

12:29.124 --> 12:30.776
<i>(She was evil.)</i>

12:30.876 --> 12:32.836
<i>(She must be purified.)</i>

12:33.837 --> 12:38.826
<i>(She taught you to use the flame, she wants
you to purify her for everlasting life.)</i>

12:38.926 --> 12:40.928
<i>(She wants the flame.)</i>

12:41.303 --> 12:42.663
<i>(It's your turn.)</i>

12:42.763 --> 12:44.874
<i>(It's your turn. You can do it.)</i>

12:44.974 --> 12:47.309
<i>(You're the master
of the flame now.)</i>

12:47.935 --> 12:50.212
<i>(You'll get her. Now.)</i>

12:50.312 --> 12:53.107
<i>(It's up to you. You're the master.)</i>

12:54.483 --> 12:56.026
<i>(That's right.)</i>

13:26.390 --> 13:28.208
Donald, come here.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.210
- No, Mother.
- You're a bad boy.

13:30.310 --> 13:33.339
- You're evil and you must be punished.
- No, Mother, please don't.

13:33.439 --> 13:35.007
I promise I'll be good.

13:35.107 --> 13:36.942
Come here I said.

13:37.901 --> 13:40.220
No Mother, please, no!

13:40.320 --> 13:43.741
Your father let you do things
like that but he's gone now.

13:56.795 --> 13:59.256
I'll burn the evil out of you.

15:14.915 --> 15:16.066
Hello?

15:16.166 --> 15:19.545
Hey, Donny. How ya doing, man?
It's Bobby.

15:20.212 --> 15:21.672
<i>Okay.</i>

15:22.089 --> 15:23.574
You all right?

15:23.674 --> 15:25.325
Why shouldn't I be all right?

15:25.425 --> 15:29.555
<i>Well, you know I thought you might
still be a little upset about Ben.</i>

15:31.431 --> 15:33.559
<i>- Ben?
- Yeah.</i>

15:33.851 --> 15:36.770
Ben at work.
You know, the fire and everything.

15:37.062 --> 15:38.505
Oh yeah.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.716
Yeah, no, I'm all right.

15:40.816 --> 15:42.151
<i>Good.</i>

15:42.484 --> 15:46.280
Hey listen, man, I thought you might want to
meet me for a cup of coffee before work.

15:46.530 --> 15:47.906
Why?

15:48.365 --> 15:52.578
What do you mean "why"? I thought you
might want to talk or something.

15:52.786 --> 15:53.954
<i>Oh.</i>

15:54.872 --> 15:56.832
That's nice of you but, uh,

15:57.332 --> 15:59.751
I'm not going in today.
I have a

16:00.252 --> 16:02.421
couple of things I
have to take care of.

16:03.547 --> 16:05.132
Will you tell'em I won't be in?

16:05.716 --> 16:08.135
Yeah, sure I'll tell them.

16:09.970 --> 16:11.663
Okay. Well, look,

16:11.763 --> 16:13.724
<i>I'll see you tomorrow then, huh?</i>

16:14.057 --> 16:15.559
Goodbye.

16:40.626 --> 16:42.878
<i>(You'll get all of them now.)</i>

16:43.086 --> 16:46.798
<i>(That's right. It's up to you.
You're the master.)</i>

18:04.042 --> 18:05.752
We're closed.

18:06.211 --> 18:08.363
Could I just get something simple?

18:08.463 --> 18:10.632
Something that's already arranged.

18:12.509 --> 18:15.095
Something that wouldn't
be too much trouble.

18:15.679 --> 18:17.806
I'm sorry, we're closed.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.961
I need a present for my mother.
She's sick.

18:23.061 --> 18:24.730
Just something nice.

18:25.856 --> 18:28.442
It doesn't have to
be too much trouble.

18:30.819 --> 18:33.972
- Your mother?
- Yeah, she's sick, you know.

18:34.072 --> 18:35.974
She loves flowers.

18:36.074 --> 18:38.143
Just something simple. Please.

18:38.243 --> 18:40.203
Okay, something simple.

18:44.124 --> 18:46.376
I think I've got just what you want.

19:07.356 --> 19:08.882
Oh, that's beautiful.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.634
I'm sure mother will love that.

19:10.734 --> 19:14.488
Well, I guess that will do it.
That's $4.50 please.

19:25.624 --> 19:26.817
Thank you.

19:26.917 --> 19:28.694
I hope your mother feels better.

19:28.794 --> 19:30.879
Oh yeah, thanks.

19:31.296 --> 19:33.090
Mother will feel fine.

19:33.298 --> 19:34.800
Just fine.

19:36.301 --> 19:37.928
Good night.

19:44.559 --> 19:46.019
Good night.

19:56.154 --> 19:59.282
- She's a bitch!
- Yeah, you're right, man.

19:59.491 --> 20:00.951
I ought to know.

20:10.585 --> 20:12.421
Hey, hold it!

20:16.466 --> 20:18.260
Hey, I'd wait for her.

20:20.303 --> 20:22.264
Hey baby, I'll walk you home.

20:25.142 --> 20:27.294
Now she looks back, come on.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.521
Maybe you should try and make her.

20:36.486 --> 20:38.727
Hey, Miss, I can give you a lift
to the next bus station.

20:38.780 --> 20:41.032
- Baby, I'll give you a ride.
- That's the way I go.

20:44.453 --> 20:46.021
Well, I'm going to River Road.

20:46.121 --> 20:49.082
I go right passed there.
I could give you a lift.

20:52.252 --> 20:53.528
Okay.

20:53.628 --> 20:57.574
- No, don't go. Don't leave us now.
- Come back. Come on.

20:57.674 --> 20:59.993
- We blew it.
- Oh, man, we blew it.

21:00.093 --> 21:03.305
Oh, you broke my heart.
Oh woe is me.

21:05.849 --> 21:07.809
I appreciate your help.

21:08.727 --> 21:10.270
My pleasure.

21:10.812 --> 21:14.466
I ought to thank you
for letting me get these flowers.

21:14.566 --> 21:17.386
If it wasn't for me
you would have made your bus.

21:17.486 --> 21:20.739
You know, you should get these in
water as soon as you get home.

21:21.114 --> 21:22.682
Oh yeah?

21:22.782 --> 21:24.534
I'll do that.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.026
Are you in a big rush?

21:33.126 --> 21:35.253
Well, yeah, I want to get home.

21:36.046 --> 21:39.408
Would you mind if I drop these
off at my house first?

21:39.508 --> 21:42.552
It will only take a minute.
It's not far from River Road.

21:43.053 --> 21:45.163
- All right.
- My mother is

21:45.263 --> 21:47.165
already fixing dinner

21:47.265 --> 21:49.084
and I'm really late.

21:49.184 --> 21:51.628
So, I'll just drop them off and
I'll tell her I'll be right back.

21:51.728 --> 21:53.438
No, no, it's all right.

22:06.159 --> 22:07.827
I'll only be a minute.

22:13.208 --> 22:16.253
Hey, I forgot the package.

22:16.503 --> 22:18.255
Could you hand me that?

22:18.630 --> 22:20.131
Thanks.

22:20.549 --> 22:22.909
Hey, why don't you come on in
and say hello to mother?

22:23.009 --> 22:25.412
- No, no.
- She'll get a kick out of it.

22:25.512 --> 22:27.205
- And then we could go.
- No, really,

22:27.305 --> 22:30.225
- I have to get home.
- Come on. She never sees anybody.

22:30.475 --> 22:32.627
- Really, I just want to...
- Ah, come on.

22:32.727 --> 22:34.938
- Please.
- Okay.

22:35.146 --> 22:36.982
(whispers) Christ.

22:37.482 --> 22:39.109
Careful now.

23:06.094 --> 23:08.054
Mother, I'm home.

23:10.890 --> 23:13.768
- Make yourself at home.
I'll be right back. - Okay.

23:13.977 --> 23:16.338
- Hey, I don't even know your name.
- Kathy.

23:16.438 --> 23:18.882
- Kathy Jordan.
- I'm Donny Kohler.

23:18.982 --> 23:20.609
Donald, you know.

23:20.817 --> 23:22.485
It's nice to meet you.

23:23.486 --> 23:25.363
Well, let me go get mother.

24:57.956 --> 24:59.708
Mother must be upstairs.

25:03.086 --> 25:05.630
Mother! Mother!

25:33.032 --> 25:37.354
Mother is even sicker than I thought. I have
to call a doctor and get him right over here.

25:37.454 --> 25:40.039
You understand.
I can't leave her in this condition.

25:40.373 --> 25:43.585
As soon as you've finished
I'd like to call a cab.

25:49.758 --> 25:53.370
Dr. Wells? This is Donald Kohler.
It's mother again.

25:53.470 --> 25:56.706
She's worse than before.
She can't get out of bed.

25:56.806 --> 25:58.500
Could you come right over?

25:58.600 --> 25:59.976
Yes.

26:00.477 --> 26:02.003
Oh, would you?

26:02.103 --> 26:03.563
Would you?

26:03.772 --> 26:05.482
Thank you very much.

26:06.952 --> 26:10.512
The doctor will be right over. If you wait a
couple of minutes I can give you a ride home.

26:10.612 --> 26:12.847
Look. I know you have
your hands full here,

26:12.947 --> 26:15.100
I'd just like to call a cab, okay?

26:15.200 --> 26:19.204
- But if you wait a few minutes, the doctor...
- Look, may I please use the phone?

26:21.247 --> 26:23.733
- Are you asking for my permission?
- Yes.

26:23.833 --> 26:26.419
May I please use the phone?

26:28.338 --> 26:29.614
Yes!

26:29.714 --> 26:31.299
You may.

26:47.273 --> 26:49.317
Hello, would please send a cab to...

27:21.933 --> 27:24.686
Oh please, help!

27:39.242 --> 27:41.786
Donald, come here!

28:05.476 --> 28:07.020
Help me!

28:20.909 --> 28:22.519
Please help me!

28:22.619 --> 28:24.287
Help me!

28:25.622 --> 28:27.874
Oh no!

29:16.506 --> 29:17.882
God!

29:21.886 --> 29:25.640
Please, God, no!

29:27.600 --> 29:30.436
No!

29:33.439 --> 29:35.441
Please!

30:54.312 --> 30:56.214
You're a friend of that nut,

30:56.314 --> 30:58.995
you tell him for me if he isn't back
here Monday, he's out of a job.

30:59.067 --> 31:01.719
Give the guy a break. He's
been sick. He's got problems.

31:01.819 --> 31:03.096
- Sick?
- Yeah.

31:03.196 --> 31:06.307
- If so, how come he doesn't answer the
phone? - Didn't his mother answer?

31:06.407 --> 31:09.268
- Nobody answers.
- Maybe he's taken her to the doctor.

31:09.368 --> 31:12.689
Look, I don't care if they took
each other to the doctor.

31:12.789 --> 31:15.458
He's been out a week
now and that's it.

31:15.625 --> 31:18.377
Ben will be in the hospital
for at least a month.

31:20.713 --> 31:22.924
You just tell him what I said.

32:20.982 --> 32:24.443
- Can't get it started? - It just stalled
out on me. It won't do anything.

32:24.610 --> 32:28.531
- Could I give you a lift to the next gas station?
- Oh, I'd really appreciate that.

32:39.667 --> 32:42.361
You won't mind if I drop these
things off at my house first?

32:42.461 --> 32:44.922
- It's on the way.
- No, that's okay.

33:54.242 --> 33:59.288
And when I tell you not to take something
off a shelf you better listen to me.

34:21.978 --> 34:23.478
Will that be all?

34:23.896 --> 34:26.774
Uh, and two packs of one-twenty.

34:42.290 --> 34:44.500
That's $4.99 out of five.

34:44.667 --> 34:46.252
Thank you.

34:58.848 --> 35:00.308
There you go.

35:01.392 --> 35:03.753
- Can I help you with that package?
- No, thanks.

35:03.853 --> 35:05.379
Can I give you a ride home?

35:05.479 --> 35:08.216
My truck is right outside. Why don't
you let me give you a ride home?

35:08.316 --> 35:10.468
- Would you please just get out of my way?
- It's right outside. I just could...

35:10.568 --> 35:12.136
Is there a problem here?

35:12.236 --> 35:14.388
No, there is no problem.
No problem.

35:14.488 --> 35:18.576
I must have scared her, huh? I'm
going to apologize. Hey, Miss! Miss!

35:37.803 --> 35:39.747
Mother, this is Linda.

35:39.847 --> 35:43.476
I wanted you to meet here before
I introduced her to the others.

35:50.983 --> 35:53.010
<i>- Hello?
- Hey Donny.</i>

35:53.110 --> 35:54.595
It's Bobby.

35:54.695 --> 35:56.430
<i>Oh, hi Bobby.</i>

35:56.530 --> 35:58.349
Hi, hey listen, man,

35:58.449 --> 36:00.910
I got a message from Vito for you.

36:01.118 --> 36:04.313
He says if you don' show
up to work on Monday,

36:04.413 --> 36:06.374
<i>you're out of a job.</i>

36:09.502 --> 36:11.921
<i>Hey Donny, did you hear what I said?</i>

36:14.590 --> 36:17.410
<i>Okay, listen, man, all I'm trying
to do is help you out, you know,</i>

36:17.510 --> 36:20.830
and all you giving me is nothing,
so have a nice life, huh.

36:20.930 --> 36:23.516
<i>Wait a minute!
Listen to me, Bobby.</i>

36:23.891 --> 36:25.726
Hey, I'm in a lot of trouble.

36:26.560 --> 36:28.546
<i>I'm, I'm scared.</i>

36:28.646 --> 36:30.606
What kind of trouble?
What's the matter?

36:31.440 --> 36:32.967
It's my mother.

36:33.067 --> 36:34.677
She's sick,

36:34.777 --> 36:36.445
you know, and

36:37.655 --> 36:40.808
well I'm real worried, Bobby.

36:40.908 --> 36:43.227
You want me to come over,
we can talk about it.

36:43.327 --> 36:45.413
No, no, you can't
come over right now.

36:46.288 --> 36:48.332
Father Gerritty's gonna come over

36:50.251 --> 36:51.819
because

36:51.919 --> 36:55.323
my mother is sick and she hasn't
been able to get to church.

36:55.423 --> 36:59.510
Now wait a minute, Gerritty? Now what's
that old witch doctor going to do for her?

37:00.177 --> 37:03.205
Well, he knows what to do.

37:03.305 --> 37:05.207
<i>- He knows.
- Okay, okay.</i>

37:05.307 --> 37:08.377
But now listen, gimme a call
if you need anything.

37:08.477 --> 37:09.879
<i>Hey, Donny,</i>

37:09.979 --> 37:14.066
<i>I really hope that you get
to work on Monday, man.</i>

37:15.151 --> 37:16.735
Listen, Bobby,

37:17.736 --> 37:19.447
thanks for calling me.

37:21.991 --> 37:24.118
I think you're the only friend
I have out there.

37:24.618 --> 37:27.455
It's all right.
I'll see you, man.

37:43.095 --> 37:44.513
Trash!

37:44.722 --> 37:48.000
Trash! Trash! Just like your father!

37:48.100 --> 37:50.002
- No!
- Oh yes!

37:50.102 --> 37:52.004
He got away, but you won't.

37:52.104 --> 37:54.340
You'll pay, you'll suffer.

37:54.440 --> 37:57.443
No. You'll have to suffer now.

37:57.860 --> 38:00.554
<i>(She's evil. She
can't hurt you now.)</i>

38:00.654 --> 38:03.641
<i>(Remember, punish her.
We'll help you.)</i>

38:03.741 --> 38:05.534
That's right.

38:06.619 --> 38:08.829
I have my friends with me.

38:10.122 --> 38:14.293
If she doesn't stop it,
I'll punish her again.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.029
You hear that, old lady?

38:17.129 --> 38:19.840
I'll punish you again!

38:26.889 --> 38:28.999
Did you hear me?
Did you hear what I said?

38:29.099 --> 38:31.602
Don't you ever talk to me like that.

38:32.353 --> 38:34.063
That's better.

38:39.401 --> 38:41.971
Don't make me do
anything bad, Mother.

38:42.071 --> 38:44.490
(giggling)

38:46.534 --> 38:48.310
You laughing at me?

38:48.410 --> 38:51.121
You think I'm crazy for talking
to my mother like that?

38:55.876 --> 38:57.862
You're all bitches,

38:57.962 --> 39:00.130
selfish and vain.

39:00.756 --> 39:03.384
Don't you dare laugh at me.

39:08.722 --> 39:11.267
I won't stand for impudence
from any of you.

39:13.477 --> 39:16.464
And stop trying to
scare me all the time.

39:16.564 --> 39:19.149
It won't work.
You can't fool me.

39:21.569 --> 39:23.862
If you promise to be good

39:25.322 --> 39:27.408
I'll leave the lights on.

39:29.451 --> 39:31.203
And remember,

39:32.663 --> 39:34.790
no more laughing.

44:47.519 --> 44:49.296
I'll get you, Donald!

44:49.396 --> 44:51.231
I'll get you!

46:36.086 --> 46:37.754
What are you doing here?

46:37.963 --> 46:40.699
Donny. Donny Kohler.

46:40.799 --> 46:43.301
I thought you told me
you'd never come back here.

46:45.095 --> 46:48.807
Oh, you came to get holy water.
You don't have to steal it.

46:49.558 --> 46:51.585
Doesn't it put out the flame?

46:51.685 --> 46:53.311
The flame?

46:53.770 --> 46:55.422
You have a problem?

46:55.522 --> 46:56.940
Yes.

46:57.190 --> 46:59.026
Let me help you with this.

47:09.161 --> 47:10.938
Do you believe in the devil?

47:11.038 --> 47:13.774
What kind of a question
is that to ask a priest?

47:13.874 --> 47:15.150
Do you?

47:15.250 --> 47:18.820
I believe in evil, yes,
but not in the devil.

47:18.920 --> 47:20.614
But I've seen the devil.

47:20.714 --> 47:22.908
No, it's in your mind, Donny.

47:23.008 --> 47:26.244
The devil is only a symbol.
A symbol of evil.

47:26.344 --> 47:28.538
Evil lives only if we let it.

47:28.638 --> 47:30.707
So you don't believe that it exists?

47:30.807 --> 47:33.435
No, it doesn't exist.

47:33.602 --> 47:35.170
Only if you want it to.

47:35.270 --> 47:37.172
You have all the answers.

47:37.272 --> 47:39.716
All the things you read in books.

47:39.816 --> 47:42.277
All the things you tell people.

47:47.532 --> 47:49.101
Look at these symbols.

47:49.201 --> 47:51.228
I was burned, just like in hell!

47:51.328 --> 47:52.813
What is this?

47:52.913 --> 47:54.873
What happened to your arms?

47:56.083 --> 47:58.835
It was the punishment for my sins.

47:59.211 --> 48:00.837
Who did this to you?

48:03.715 --> 48:05.425
Tell me!

48:07.260 --> 48:08.929
My mother.

48:09.846 --> 48:11.556
My mother.

48:11.973 --> 48:13.558
Help me.

48:14.101 --> 48:16.128
You mean your mother
did this to you?

48:16.228 --> 48:17.938
But Why?

48:18.313 --> 48:20.398
Because I was evil.

48:22.109 --> 48:25.070
I was born from an evil deed.

48:26.113 --> 48:29.574
She was burning it out
of me to save me.

48:32.285 --> 48:34.246
If I was bad,

48:34.579 --> 48:36.581
she burned me.

48:37.290 --> 48:39.417
If I had evil thoughts,

48:39.584 --> 48:41.753
she would burn me.

48:44.339 --> 48:46.758
Do you understand me?

48:47.050 --> 48:50.537
But Donny, you must forgive those
who trespassed.

48:50.637 --> 48:52.597
You must forgive your mother.

49:02.190 --> 49:03.608
Donny,

49:05.777 --> 49:08.613
I want to help you.
Do you believe me?

49:09.030 --> 49:10.265
Yes.

49:10.365 --> 49:12.117
Do you want my help?

49:12.826 --> 49:14.227
Yes.

49:14.327 --> 49:16.313
Then do as I tell you.

49:16.413 --> 49:19.875
Put these thoughts of evil
out of your mind now.

49:20.500 --> 49:23.044
Resist them and you'll find peace.

49:23.295 --> 49:25.046
Don't you want that?

49:25.463 --> 49:28.258
Yes. Yes I do.

49:28.633 --> 49:30.927
But there are other things,

49:31.428 --> 49:32.929
other people.

49:33.346 --> 49:35.223
Come back to me.

49:36.183 --> 49:39.336
Come to my office or come to
confession if you like.

49:39.436 --> 49:41.421
You haven't been in
a while, have you?

49:41.521 --> 49:43.481
Only come back and see me.

50:30.862 --> 50:32.906
Mother, please forgive me.

50:33.657 --> 50:36.393
I told the priest because
he wanted to help me.

50:36.493 --> 50:38.453
I didn't do anything wrong.

50:41.539 --> 50:43.250
I can change.

50:45.293 --> 50:47.254
I want to forget our past.

50:49.464 --> 50:51.383
I want to forgive you.

51:14.823 --> 51:16.408
Please,

51:17.659 --> 51:19.494
help me forgive her.

52:29.856 --> 52:31.441
Hello?

52:31.649 --> 52:33.218
Is Bobby there?

52:33.318 --> 52:35.445
Bob, it's for you.

52:41.117 --> 52:43.286
<i>- Hello?
- Hello Bobby?</i>

52:43.870 --> 52:46.289
<i>- Yeah, who's this?
- It's Donny.</i>

52:46.873 --> 52:51.361
Hey, Donny. This is a surprise,
what are you up to, man?

52:51.461 --> 52:54.422
Nothing.
I'm not up to nothing.

52:55.590 --> 52:58.134
I just thought you might want to go
to a movie or something.

52:58.343 --> 53:01.246
Now wait a minute.
Let me get this straight,

53:01.346 --> 53:04.265
you're sure you don't want to
stay home tonight?

53:04.474 --> 53:05.975
Come on.

53:07.310 --> 53:11.381
Listen, if you're really serious
about doing something tonight,

53:11.481 --> 53:15.443
I got something we can do, man,
and it ain't no movie, you know.

53:15.610 --> 53:17.779
<i>Oh yeah? What?</i>

53:18.488 --> 53:20.990
Guess what I got lined
up for tonight.

53:21.658 --> 53:23.118
Two.

53:23.326 --> 53:25.437
Two live ones, man,

53:25.537 --> 53:28.289
and let me tell you
they are dynamite.

53:30.375 --> 53:32.252
You know what they're into?

53:32.544 --> 53:34.337
No, what?

53:35.380 --> 53:39.659
I can't go into detail right now but
take my word for it, they are dynamite.

53:39.759 --> 53:42.329
Well, I thought we could

53:42.429 --> 53:44.556
spend kind of a

53:44.764 --> 53:48.226
quite night together.
Just talk or something like that.

53:48.476 --> 53:50.337
Are you kidding?
This is perfect.

53:50.437 --> 53:53.423
Now, my wife thinks I'm working
the weekend shift, okay.

53:53.523 --> 53:57.052
I got all the calls made,
my ass is covered,

53:57.152 --> 54:00.889
and I don't feel like sitting in some
dumb movie holding your hand. No offense.

54:00.989 --> 54:03.016
Well, wait a minute,
I didn't mean that.

54:03.116 --> 54:06.770
<i>Look, meet me at the Palace Disco tonight
at 8 o'clock, all right? That's it.</i>

54:06.870 --> 54:09.105
<i>- What if I can't be there?
- Look,</i>

54:09.205 --> 54:11.958
I'll see you at 8, okay?

54:12.459 --> 54:15.695
Okay, Bobby.
I'll see you at 8.

54:15.795 --> 54:17.255
See you then.

54:24.012 --> 54:27.515
Bob, I'm gonna kill this kid
if you don't get him out of here.

55:14.562 --> 55:16.773
Oh, these are nice.

55:17.065 --> 55:20.235
And here is another item I think
you really want to have a look.

55:22.070 --> 55:23.571
Come on, let's go.

55:23.988 --> 55:25.515
Okay, thanks anyway.

55:25.615 --> 55:27.976
I'm sorry I couldn't
have been of more help.

55:28.076 --> 55:29.702
BYE bye.

55:38.795 --> 55:40.922
Yes, sir. Can I be of help to you?

55:41.089 --> 55:44.367
Ah, well, could you
show me that shirt?

55:44.467 --> 55:47.262
- The one they were looking at.
- Oh, sure.

55:48.054 --> 55:49.556
The red one.

55:50.056 --> 55:51.891
Oh, the Matador.

55:54.602 --> 55:58.273
- The Matador? - The shirt. The
styling. That's what its called.

55:58.565 --> 56:00.275
Oh yes.

56:00.567 --> 56:03.278
I forgot. The Matador.
I've seen this before.

56:04.487 --> 56:05.889
Very interesting.

56:05.989 --> 56:07.407
Yes.

56:07.657 --> 56:09.284
Nice styling.

56:12.495 --> 56:14.230
What did that lady think?

56:14.330 --> 56:16.124
She liked it, didn't she?

56:16.916 --> 56:19.335
To tell you the truth
she thought it was tacky.

56:19.794 --> 56:21.212
<i>Oh.</i>

56:22.213 --> 56:23.881
What do you think?

56:24.591 --> 56:29.220
If you could tell me if this is for a business occasion
or a casual affair I could be of much more help.

56:29.554 --> 56:33.349
Well, I was looking for something
that you could wear to a disco.

56:33.516 --> 56:36.769
Okay. Let's get to the right department,
shall we? Just come this way.

56:41.316 --> 56:43.359
I just got these in.

56:44.152 --> 56:46.029
This is what they're all wearing.

56:49.949 --> 56:53.369
Unless you're into the more wild
look, which is really passe'.

56:54.829 --> 56:56.873
That's a beautiful plaid, isn't it?

56:57.373 --> 57:00.793
Well, I'll tell you the truth, for the disco
scene, I think this is what you want.

57:06.299 --> 57:08.076
Well, why don't you take that shirt?

57:08.176 --> 57:10.787
What size are you?
15 and a half?

57:10.887 --> 57:12.305
Yeah.

57:15.266 --> 57:16.851
There you are.

57:18.478 --> 57:20.938
Can I set you up with
an entire ensemble?

57:21.481 --> 57:22.840
Okay.

57:22.940 --> 57:25.068
Great. Just come this way.

57:25.485 --> 57:28.071
I think we can make a new man
of you in no time.

57:37.205 --> 57:40.416
This three piece suit would be
terrific with that shirt.

57:40.958 --> 57:44.462
Specially made for dancing.
Elastic thread in the seams.

57:44.629 --> 57:46.197
You'll look terrific in this.

57:46.297 --> 57:49.075
Listen, now why don't you just take
these in the dressing room

57:49.175 --> 57:50.868
and try them on? See if they fit.

57:50.968 --> 57:53.705
No, that's all right.
I'll try them on at home.

57:53.805 --> 57:56.874
Well, fine now. We'll just get you
into a pair of shoes then, shall we?

57:56.974 --> 58:02.146
Alfred, could you fix this gentleman up
with a pair of fourteen thirty-twos please?

58:02.313 --> 58:03.798
Oh, your size, sir?

58:03.898 --> 58:06.693
I don't know.
Nine I think.

58:07.568 --> 58:09.445
Measure him, Alfred.

58:09.737 --> 58:12.765
Well, I just have these wrapped up
if they're satisfactory of course.

58:12.865 --> 58:15.952
- What do you think?
- I think it's a dynamite outfit.

58:16.119 --> 58:17.620
Really?

58:18.371 --> 58:20.373
You'll steal the show.

58:59.454 --> 59:04.417
Hey, there he is! Hey, Donny,
over here, baby! Over here!

59:05.251 --> 59:07.695
Hey, you're looking terrific, man.

59:07.795 --> 59:09.906
Let me introduce you to some people.
This is Farrah.

59:10.006 --> 59:11.449
- Hi.
- Hi.

59:11.549 --> 59:13.618
And this beautiful girl is Karen.

59:13.718 --> 59:16.621
- Hi, Donny.
- Here. Sit down, my man, sit down.

59:16.721 --> 59:18.706
Make yourself at home, my boy.

59:18.806 --> 59:21.417
Come here. Sit down, baby.
There you go.

59:21.517 --> 59:24.061
So, you work with Bobby
at the incinerator, huh?

59:24.270 --> 59:26.147
Yes, we work together.

59:26.606 --> 59:31.903
Yeah, and don't be calling us trash or
making none of them garbage jokes of yours.

59:32.528 --> 59:35.448
You mean I have to can
those garbage jokes?

59:36.574 --> 59:39.285
Oh, look! He's getting
all burned up.

59:41.454 --> 59:44.165
- So, how do you like it there?
- It stinks.

59:46.542 --> 59:51.339
Yeah, well, you ain't gonna have to worry about that
if you don't show up to work on Monday.

59:51.506 --> 59:53.508
Why, are they gonna fire you?

59:53.674 --> 59:55.868
- You're damn right.
- I'll be there.

59:55.968 --> 59:57.553
I'm coming back Monday.

59:57.720 --> 01:00:00.598
I hope so.
Come on, let's dance.

01:00:00.807 --> 01:00:03.100
I've heard enough of this rubbish.

01:00:05.603 --> 01:00:07.438
Let's go, baby.

01:00:12.568 --> 01:00:14.637
So, you've been missing work lately?

01:00:14.737 --> 01:00:17.573
Yeah, I've been sick.

01:00:17.824 --> 01:00:21.686
Is it anything contagious?
I mean I'd like to know beforehand.

01:00:21.786 --> 01:00:23.913
No. It's nothing like that.

01:00:24.121 --> 01:00:25.940
I'm over it now anyway.

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:27.583
<i>Oh.</i>

01:00:44.141 --> 01:00:46.018
- You wanna dance?
- No!

01:00:46.352 --> 01:00:48.187
I mean I don't dance.

01:00:48.604 --> 01:00:50.882
- Not at all?
- Not at all.

01:00:50.982 --> 01:00:52.842
- How you doing, babe?
- Fine, Tony.

01:00:52.942 --> 01:00:55.278
- You seen Barbara?
- No, uh uh.

01:00:59.657 --> 01:01:02.285
- Who's that?
- That was my brother.

01:01:09.876 --> 01:01:12.086
- Hi, Farrah. Come on, let's dance.
- Hi.

01:01:13.087 --> 01:01:15.907
- You don't mind if I dance,
do you, Donny? - No. Go ahead.

01:01:16.007 --> 01:01:17.592
All right.

01:02:57.525 --> 01:02:59.068
No!

01:03:12.957 --> 01:03:16.168
Hey, what did you do?
What's the matter with you, man?

01:03:19.839 --> 01:03:21.157
Jesus!

01:03:21.257 --> 01:03:23.367
- Hey, Anthony, Anthony.
- Hey, Sassoon, what's up?

01:03:23.467 --> 01:03:26.078
- Some guy just threw a candle in
your sister's face. - Holy shit!

01:03:26.178 --> 01:03:27.997
- What do you mean? What?!
- Yeah, that guy over there.

01:03:28.097 --> 01:03:29.640
Hey, you motherfucker!

01:03:38.482 --> 01:03:39.775
You!

01:03:45.322 --> 01:03:48.743
You scarred my sister for life!
You scarred her for life!

01:03:49.577 --> 01:03:51.495
Get away from me. Please.

01:03:51.704 --> 01:03:53.289
Leave me alone!

01:03:53.998 --> 01:03:55.416
Please!

01:04:07.970 --> 01:04:09.872
Hey, you sick son of a bitch.

01:04:09.972 --> 01:04:12.767
Get out of there!
Get the hell out of there!

01:04:14.018 --> 01:04:17.438
I'm going to kill you!
You ain't getting away with this!

01:04:23.694 --> 01:04:25.571
I'm not through with you!

01:04:36.457 --> 01:04:40.194
Where is Tony?
I can't believe what he did to me.

01:04:40.294 --> 01:04:41.904
Don't worry, I'll take care of him.

01:04:42.004 --> 01:04:45.424
And you your friend is a dead man.

01:04:45.758 --> 01:04:47.218
Dead.

01:04:54.975 --> 01:04:58.629
<i>(You're safe now, you're safe.
You got away, you did right.)</i>

01:04:58.729 --> 01:05:00.815
<i>(She was evil. Evil.)</i>

01:05:03.275 --> 01:05:05.594
- Did you pay the check?
- No.

01:05:05.694 --> 01:05:07.138
I thought you did.

01:05:07.238 --> 01:05:08.948
Hey, come on.

01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:11.225
Hey, you missed us.

01:05:11.325 --> 01:05:14.979
- Come on. Shit. - Those guys
were ready to give us a lift.

01:05:15.079 --> 01:05:17.289
Don't worry, we'll get one.

01:05:18.541 --> 01:05:20.901
Oh yeah, fat chance.

01:05:21.001 --> 01:05:22.461
Oh, it's freezing.

01:05:41.605 --> 01:05:45.134
Thanks a lot.
Oh God, you've had a bad night.

01:05:45.234 --> 01:05:46.761
Cut it out, Suzanne!

01:05:46.861 --> 01:05:49.513
Listen, could you take us to Rudy's?

01:05:49.613 --> 01:05:52.016
- What's that?
- It's a bar, dummy.

01:05:52.116 --> 01:05:54.060
- Don't be a wise-ass, Suzanne.
- Sorry.

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:55.853
It's on 19.

01:05:55.953 --> 01:05:58.998
- Sure. Get in.
- Oh, great! Thanks.

01:06:13.304 --> 01:06:16.540
Excuse my appearance,
but I just got jumped.

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:18.292
- Really?
- What?

01:06:18.392 --> 01:06:20.060
He was jumped.

01:06:20.311 --> 01:06:22.813
Oh, you were? What happened?

01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:25.132
A couple of guys came
out of no place.

01:06:25.232 --> 01:06:27.401
They jumped me in a parking lot.

01:06:27.818 --> 01:06:29.945
- Three of them.
- Really?

01:06:30.112 --> 01:06:32.515
- Yeah. Three guys with knives.
- Oh wow!

01:06:32.615 --> 01:06:34.909
- Just now?
- Yeah.

01:06:35.117 --> 01:06:37.311
- Where was this?
- Back in town.

01:06:37.411 --> 01:06:39.480
What did they do? Take your money?

01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:41.290
They wanted to,

01:06:41.457 --> 01:06:42.858
but I showed them.

01:06:42.958 --> 01:06:46.195
They didn't know who they were messing with.
They thought they had themselves a real pushover.

01:06:46.295 --> 01:06:49.590
- What did you do? - I beat the
hell out of all three of them.

01:06:51.592 --> 01:06:55.429
I... I was in the marines.
Green berets.

01:06:56.805 --> 01:06:59.542
Well, I thought the green
berets was the Army.

01:06:59.642 --> 01:07:03.270
Oh, this was just like the green
berets. It was a special division.

01:07:07.816 --> 01:07:10.678
Patty, do you think
Jeff is gonna be there?

01:07:10.778 --> 01:07:14.473
- If Jeff is gonna be there, I don't wanna go.
- Are you gonna start with that again?

01:07:14.573 --> 01:07:17.518
- Who's Jeff?
- Oh, he's this real asshole.

01:07:17.618 --> 01:07:21.772
Don't worry. I'm sure that Janice and Billy
and all the rest are gonna be there.

01:07:21.872 --> 01:07:23.816
We'll sit with them.
Just ignore him.

01:07:23.916 --> 01:07:29.964
I can't just ignore him. He follows
me around. He's such a drag.

01:07:30.464 --> 01:07:32.825
You picked a helluva
time to start this.

01:07:32.925 --> 01:07:35.703
We're almost there and now all of a
sudden you decide you don't want to go.

01:07:35.803 --> 01:07:39.665
I just realized I don't want to be
hassled all night long.

01:07:39.765 --> 01:07:42.977
- Wait a minute. Hold it. Hold it.
- And what are we gonna do now?

01:07:43.477 --> 01:07:47.464
Take it easy. Why don't
we go to my house?

01:07:47.564 --> 01:07:51.360
You can call anybody you want to see in
there. We could have a party right there.

01:07:51.819 --> 01:07:53.721
Yeah? Nobody'll mind?

01:07:53.821 --> 01:07:56.390
- No.
- We can invite anybody we want?

01:07:56.490 --> 01:07:59.076
Yeah. It's my house.

01:08:01.745 --> 01:08:06.417
Do you have any beer?
Because we're gonna need some beer.

01:08:07.293 --> 01:08:09.486
- We can stop and get beer.
- Great!

01:08:09.586 --> 01:08:12.381
- Far out...
- A case should do it.

01:08:28.856 --> 01:08:32.067
Oh God, this is a spooky house.

01:08:32.526 --> 01:08:34.803
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, I know.

01:08:34.903 --> 01:08:36.697
It's an old house.

01:08:47.332 --> 01:08:49.001
WOW!

01:08:51.045 --> 01:08:55.573
- Jesus! What a place!
- This is really fabulous.

01:08:55.674 --> 01:08:57.826
Oh Patty, check this out.

01:08:57.926 --> 01:09:00.203
- What a beautiful room.
- What is this?

01:09:00.304 --> 01:09:03.974
- I'll put the beer in the kitchen.
- Look at the stuff in the dining room.

01:09:04.433 --> 01:09:06.310
Oh my God.

01:09:06.852 --> 01:09:09.412
- Oh, to live in a place like this.
- This is an incredible room.

01:09:09.813 --> 01:09:11.564
Hey...

01:09:16.862 --> 01:09:19.907
Suzanne, this is really weird.

01:09:38.050 --> 01:09:39.635
You like that?

01:09:40.511 --> 01:09:42.496
Oh... Oh yeah.

01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:45.933
Oh yeah. This kind of stuff
is fabulous. I love it.

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:50.770
Well, come with me. I'll show you
something that's really nice.

01:10:09.248 --> 01:10:12.918
Oh boy, do you need a paint job.

01:10:37.276 --> 01:10:38.944
Father Gerritty!

01:10:39.778 --> 01:10:41.513
- Father Gerr...
- What's the trouble?

01:10:41.613 --> 01:10:45.017
Listen, Father Gerritty, my name is Bobby
Tuttle, I'm a friend of Donny Kohler's.

01:10:45.117 --> 01:10:47.811
He's in a lot of trouble, Father.
He's gone crazy.

01:10:47.911 --> 01:10:49.791
- Well, come in.
- No, no, no, there isn't time.

01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:52.816
He's really flipped out and this guy is
after him and wants to kill him.

01:10:52.916 --> 01:10:55.903
'Cause Donny attacked his sister
and her face is...

01:10:56.003 --> 01:10:58.155
Father, he's gone crazy and
I don't know what to do.

01:10:58.255 --> 01:10:59.990
I didn't know whether to go
to the police or what,

01:11:00.090 --> 01:11:02.493
so would you come with me over to his
house? You know how to talk to him.

01:11:02.593 --> 01:11:04.578
Will you please come an help me?
Will you please?

01:11:04.678 --> 01:11:06.246
- He needs help. Please!
- All right.

01:11:06.346 --> 01:11:10.058
- All right, just a minute. I'll come
with you. - Okay, hurry. Please. Please.

01:11:21.487 --> 01:11:23.639
Suzanne, come here.

01:11:23.739 --> 01:11:26.825
You got to see this.
Come here.

01:11:29.828 --> 01:11:32.039
You got to see this in here.

01:11:32.372 --> 01:11:34.041
Suzanne.

01:11:35.709 --> 01:11:37.336
Suzanne?

01:11:40.589 --> 01:11:42.174
Suzanne?

01:11:43.258 --> 01:11:44.927
Suzanne.

01:11:49.014 --> 01:11:50.641
Suzanne.

01:11:54.102 --> 01:11:55.379
Suzanne.

01:11:55.479 --> 01:11:57.731
Are you up there, Suzanne?

01:12:25.926 --> 01:12:27.719
You there?

01:12:28.637 --> 01:12:31.598
Suzanne, will you cut it out.

01:12:40.190 --> 01:12:43.277
Suzanne?

01:12:44.111 --> 01:12:45.779
Oh God!

01:13:02.254 --> 01:13:04.298
I tried being nice.

01:13:05.716 --> 01:13:08.093
But every one of you took advantage.

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:15.225
Now

01:13:19.938 --> 01:13:22.608
you're going to have
to pay the price.

01:13:40.292 --> 01:13:41.835
Donny!

01:13:43.211 --> 01:13:45.422
Hey, Donny!

01:13:50.218 --> 01:13:54.264
Donny. Mrs. Kohler.
It's Father Gerritty.

01:14:00.479 --> 01:14:03.774
Hey, his truck is right over there.
He's here. He's here.

01:14:13.033 --> 01:14:15.644
Hey Donny, come on, man.

01:14:15.744 --> 01:14:18.981
That girl's brother is after you.
We're just trying to help you.

01:14:19.081 --> 01:14:20.499
Come on!

01:14:35.806 --> 01:14:37.516
Help!

01:14:57.369 --> 01:14:59.579
Holy Christ!

01:15:09.464 --> 01:15:11.216
Are you all right?

01:15:11.466 --> 01:15:13.301
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:15:20.016 --> 01:15:22.519
It's all right. It's okay.

01:15:41.955 --> 01:15:43.623
Are you all right?

01:15:58.138 --> 01:15:59.723
Donny?

01:16:00.348 --> 01:16:01.958
Mrs. Kohler.

01:16:02.058 --> 01:16:03.935
It's Father Gerritty.

01:16:19.826 --> 01:16:22.788
I did what you said
and it didn't work.

01:16:23.121 --> 01:16:25.081
You lied to me!

01:16:37.385 --> 01:16:38.762
Oh my God!

01:16:39.971 --> 01:16:42.724
It's all right.

01:16:42.974 --> 01:16:44.434
It's all right.

01:17:00.826 --> 01:17:05.080
<i>(He lied to you. He lied to you.
Now you've got to hide.)</i>

01:17:06.289 --> 01:17:09.668
<i>(Hide. They're all liars. Liars.)</i>

01:17:11.002 --> 01:17:13.255
A fine lot of thanks I get.

01:17:13.797 --> 01:17:18.426
I bring you into my home.
I give you love and shelter,

01:17:19.135 --> 01:17:21.263
better than any of you ever had.

01:17:21.972 --> 01:17:23.932
And you turn on me.

01:17:24.599 --> 01:17:26.643
I still let you stay.

01:17:29.354 --> 01:17:31.064
Well,

01:17:34.442 --> 01:17:35.944
no more.

01:17:36.194 --> 01:17:38.071
We hate you, Donny.

01:17:38.446 --> 01:17:41.074
- What?
- We hate you.

01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:47.314
We always hated you.

01:17:47.414 --> 01:17:49.583
We don't forgive you.

01:17:50.792 --> 01:17:55.547
We want to be free.
We will be free. We will be free.

01:18:04.973 --> 01:18:08.877
<i>(Donny, you've gone too far, you've
done it now. You told the priest.)</i>

01:18:08.977 --> 01:18:11.588
<i>(You shouldn't have told the priest.
The priest shouldn't know.)</i>

01:18:11.688 --> 01:18:13.840
<i>(You lied. Donny, you lied.)</i>

01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:16.885
<i>(You lied to us. We hate liars.)</i>

01:18:16.985 --> 01:18:18.678
<i>(You lose. You did it.)</i>

01:18:18.778 --> 01:18:21.723
<i>(You're not the master.
You're not the master anymore.)</i>

01:18:21.823 --> 01:18:24.935
<i>(We'll find a new master.
We'll find a better master.)</i>

01:18:25.035 --> 01:18:27.203
<i>(You're finished.
You lost.)</i>

01:18:45.805 --> 01:18:48.224
I will never forgive you, Donald!

01:18:56.107 --> 01:19:00.428
<i>And this is all that remained of the
Kohler house which burned down last night.</i>

01:19:00.528 --> 01:19:03.890
<i>- Firefighters uncovered 5 bodies...
- Michael, I've told you to turn off that TV</i>

01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:05.851
and get upstairs and
clean your room.

01:19:05.951 --> 01:19:08.854
<i>Authorities have labeled
the fire suspicious.</i>

01:19:08.954 --> 01:19:10.689
Michael, did you hear what I said?

01:19:10.789 --> 01:19:14.292
I said to get upstairs
and clean your room.

01:19:16.836 --> 01:19:20.365
Michael. Michael, turn off the TV!

01:19:20.465 --> 01:19:25.428
Don't you ever ignore me.
Don't you disobey me. How dare you.

01:19:25.971 --> 01:19:30.058
I am your mother.
Don't you ever ignore me.

01:19:33.228 --> 01:19:35.630
<i>(Michael. Michael.)</i>

01:19:35.730 --> 01:19:38.508
<i>(Don't worry, Michael.
We're here now.)</i>

01:19:38.608 --> 01:19:40.260
<i>(We're here to help you.)</i>

01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:42.554
<i>(We'll help you, Michael,
we'll help you.)</i>

01:19:42.654 --> 01:19:46.241
<i>(Don't worry, we're
here with you now.)</i>
