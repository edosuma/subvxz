00:01.100 --> 00:04.000
(electronic music)

00:08.100 --> 00:09.067
(car lock beeps)

00:09.067 --> 00:11.733
(upbeat music)

00:11.733 --> 00:12.967
* Come on home

00:12.967 --> 00:14.367
* Comin' home, baby, now

00:14.367 --> 00:15.933
* You know I'm
waitin' here for you *

00:15.933 --> 00:18.333
* I'm comin' home
now real soon *

00:18.333 --> 00:19.833
* You've been gone

00:19.833 --> 00:21.067
* Comin' home, baby, now

00:21.067 --> 00:22.667
* You don't know
what I'm gonna do *

00:22.667 --> 00:25.033
* I'm comin' home,
I know I'm overdue *

00:25.033 --> 00:26.300
* Since you went away

00:26.300 --> 00:28.267
* Expect me any day now

00:28.267 --> 00:29.533
* Real soon

00:29.533 --> 00:31.800
* I'm comin' home and
never more to roam *

00:31.800 --> 00:34.133
* Baby, tell me you're
* Baby, I'm for sure

00:34.133 --> 00:37.933
* Comin' home

00:37.933 --> 00:38.967
* I'm comin' home

00:38.967 --> 00:41.533
* Come on home

00:43.900 --> 00:44.733
- Thanks, Brianna.

00:44.733 --> 00:45.767
I enjoyed that.

00:45.767 --> 00:47.567
- You complained
the entire time.

00:47.567 --> 00:51.733
- I enjoyed it when you said
we were finished. (laughs)

00:54.567 --> 00:56.100
Coffee?

00:56.100 --> 00:57.967
- Is what you say
when you want cake.

00:57.967 --> 00:59.700
- Brianna, I'm not 12 years old.

00:59.700 --> 01:02.467
If I want cake, I will say it.

01:02.467 --> 01:04.400
Does this mean we
can't get cake?

01:04.400 --> 01:05.367
Coffee.

01:05.367 --> 01:06.200
- No.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.400
Lexi.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.833
- Should we call
roadside assistance?

01:09.833 --> 01:10.667
- Ew.

01:10.667 --> 01:13.100
(rock music)

01:17.567 --> 01:19.267
(engine revving)

01:19.267 --> 01:22.533
(musical horn honking)

01:26.600 --> 01:28.267
- [Kayne] Thank you!

01:38.333 --> 01:39.667
- [Margaret] Oh!

01:41.567 --> 01:42.933
- Hey, Maga.

01:42.933 --> 01:44.567
- Oh, ugh!

01:44.567 --> 01:46.133
Are they legal?

01:46.133 --> 01:47.367
- You after a set?

01:47.367 --> 01:49.667
Kayne, eBay or
super-cheap order?

01:49.667 --> 01:51.267
- Of course I'm not after.

01:51.267 --> 01:53.400
Wayne, I'm with the RACV.

01:53.400 --> 01:56.500
- Ouch, $133 per year

01:56.500 --> 01:59.533
versus 35 bucks for
a two-pack, Margaret.

01:59.533 --> 02:01.333
- Excuse me.

02:01.333 --> 02:02.533
I was on the jogging path.

02:02.533 --> 02:03.367
- Yes, I'm sorry.

02:03.367 --> 02:04.300
They're not from here.

02:04.300 --> 02:05.400
- When you drove past in this.

02:05.400 --> 02:07.067
- They're not used to walking.

02:07.067 --> 02:08.800
- And I just love all this.

02:08.800 --> 02:11.833
- Trail bikes are permitted
in the parks where they live.

02:11.833 --> 02:12.800
You love what?

02:12.800 --> 02:14.600
- Who did your artwork?

02:14.600 --> 02:15.800
- [Margaret] What artwork?

02:15.800 --> 02:17.267
- Can I get the
name of the artist?

02:17.267 --> 02:18.100
(engine revving)

02:18.100 --> 02:18.933
- Artist?

02:20.500 --> 02:23.100
There is no artist!

02:23.100 --> 02:24.100
- Who drew it?

02:24.100 --> 02:25.700
- That would be my son.

02:25.700 --> 02:26.867
He's very talented.

02:26.867 --> 02:28.100
- Yep, you're good to go!

02:28.100 --> 02:29.767
- Does all the signage
for Wheeler Racing,

02:29.767 --> 02:32.133
T-shirts, flags, stubby holders.

02:32.133 --> 02:33.500
- I'm Cassie.

02:33.500 --> 02:34.533
I've got a shop
on the high street

02:34.533 --> 02:36.067
with a big ugly brown wall

02:36.067 --> 02:38.433
that I'd love to fill
with your imagery.

02:38.433 --> 02:39.600
- Which shop?

02:39.600 --> 02:41.400
One of those new
ones: Home Essentials,

02:41.400 --> 02:42.967
Best Home, House and Home,

02:42.967 --> 02:45.100
Home and House, Hospitable Home?

02:45.100 --> 02:47.667
- Wheeler Racing
logo on a shop wall!

02:47.667 --> 02:49.067
- Not the actual
logo, obviously,

02:49.067 --> 02:51.533
more an extension on the style.

02:51.533 --> 02:53.467
- You mean like this?

02:53.467 --> 02:54.600
How wicked is that?

02:54.600 --> 02:56.167
He does all of the animals.

02:56.167 --> 02:57.133
- I love it.

02:57.133 --> 02:58.100
- (gasps) Wish Mom was here.

02:58.100 --> 02:59.400
You should see his wombat.

02:59.400 --> 03:00.933
- I've got to have
some of this work,

03:00.933 --> 03:02.900
and I'd be thrilled to help
get your name out there.

03:02.900 --> 03:04.800
- I would love to get
my name out there.

03:04.800 --> 03:06.200
- Can I have your card?

03:06.200 --> 03:07.500
- Go get one of my
Wheeler Racing ones

03:07.500 --> 03:09.433
from the glove box and
write your name on it.

03:09.433 --> 03:11.433
- Brianna's the face
of Wheeler Racing.

03:11.433 --> 03:12.900
She turns heads.

03:12.900 --> 03:15.500
Show her how you guide the
dragster onto the start line.

03:17.800 --> 03:20.133
I bet we go with her
image on the wall

03:20.133 --> 03:21.400
plus the full logo.

03:21.400 --> 03:23.900
Then we can chat about
some sponsorship.

03:23.900 --> 03:25.067
- This is more about getting

03:25.067 --> 03:26.900
a young artist's name out there.

03:26.900 --> 03:28.500
- Artist?

03:28.500 --> 03:29.800
- Kanye?

03:29.800 --> 03:31.300
I've never heard anyone
else called that.

03:31.300 --> 03:33.100
- It's Kayne.

03:33.100 --> 03:34.633
The Y goes before the N.

03:34.633 --> 03:36.233
- I was too excited to spell.

03:36.233 --> 03:37.433
- Are you happy with Kayne,

03:37.433 --> 03:39.633
because Kanye would
look really cool

03:39.633 --> 03:41.133
on the side of a building.

03:41.133 --> 03:43.933
- Hmm, probably important to
get the right name out there.

03:43.933 --> 03:46.867
(upbeat music)

03:46.867 --> 03:49.667
- So I got you a
little something.

03:49.667 --> 03:53.300
I thought this
looked just like you.

03:53.300 --> 03:55.833
- Oh.

03:55.833 --> 03:57.733
(gasps) I love it.

03:57.733 --> 03:59.267
It's beautiful.

03:59.267 --> 04:01.200
- See, Amber, I told
you she'd like it.

04:02.200 --> 04:05.300
- Julie, it's a Fendi.

04:05.300 --> 04:06.533
- It's good, isn't it?

04:06.533 --> 04:08.167
- Yeah, but it's too much.

04:08.167 --> 04:09.833
I can't accept this.
- Of course you can.

04:09.833 --> 04:11.867
Honestly, no one else
at the party wanted it,

04:11.867 --> 04:14.267
'cause it didn't
have enough bling.

04:14.267 --> 04:17.167
Heather had her back from
Bali party on Tuesday.

04:17.167 --> 04:18.133
- Back from Bali?

04:18.133 --> 04:19.367
- Yeah.

04:19.367 --> 04:20.300
She brought back
all the knockoffs.

04:21.167 --> 04:24.267
- Oh, (laughs) back from Bali.

04:24.267 --> 04:25.900
- What, you thought it was real?

04:25.900 --> 04:27.167
That Mom at a tidy two K

04:27.167 --> 04:29.067
she could drop on a
bag for her princess?

04:29.067 --> 04:31.333
- No, of course not.

04:31.333 --> 04:32.900
I just said back from Bali

04:32.900 --> 04:34.967
because I didn't realize
Helen was back already.

04:34.967 --> 04:35.800
- Heather!

04:35.800 --> 04:36.967
- Heather.

04:36.967 --> 04:38.300
Because of the ash cloud.

04:38.300 --> 04:41.067
Oh, there've been
so many delays.

04:41.067 --> 04:43.300
No, obviously, I knew that
this was actually a fake.

04:43.300 --> 04:45.333
- So do you love it?

04:46.733 --> 04:47.567
- I love it.

04:47.567 --> 04:48.700
- Yeah, right.

04:48.700 --> 04:50.900
- No, I absolutely, I do!

04:52.667 --> 04:54.367
Can't even wait
to start using it.

04:55.767 --> 04:58.333
(gentle music)

05:03.900 --> 05:04.900
- Let's look alive people!

05:04.900 --> 05:06.200
Come on!

05:06.200 --> 05:07.133
Hi, bye.

05:07.133 --> 05:08.133
- Why?

05:08.133 --> 05:08.967
Kiss me.

05:08.967 --> 05:09.833
- [Danny] Oh, come on.

05:11.833 --> 05:12.767
- What are you, the Pope?

05:12.767 --> 05:14.067
- We need coffee,

05:14.067 --> 05:15.300
and the kids want to
go to Office Works.

05:15.300 --> 05:17.133
Oscar needs bubble wrap
for his history project.

05:17.133 --> 05:18.333
- It's an essay!

05:18.333 --> 05:20.067
- Popping bubble
wrap helps me think.

05:20.067 --> 05:21.400
- [Edwina] What's
behind your back?

05:21.400 --> 05:22.600
- Nothing.

05:22.600 --> 05:23.733
I'm stretching.

05:25.300 --> 05:28.433
It's a, it's a yoga pose.

05:28.433 --> 05:31.067
Namaskara poshimana
sanapanahanna.

05:31.067 --> 05:32.233
- Yes, no, that's right.

05:32.233 --> 05:35.067
I know pashmina nana mascuri.

05:35.067 --> 05:36.633
- It means reverse prayer pose.

05:36.633 --> 05:39.500
- Or I bought a bag and I
don't want to show you pose.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.300
- I did not buy a bag!

05:42.900 --> 05:44.600
Julie bought it for me.

05:44.600 --> 05:45.567
- That's actually nice.

05:45.567 --> 05:47.800
- Yeah, except that it's a fake.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.200
- So?

05:49.200 --> 05:51.100
- Do we need to go over
intellectual property law again?

05:51.100 --> 05:52.900
- Ah ha!

05:52.900 --> 05:53.833
- Ah ha what?

05:53.833 --> 05:54.767
- Do you know what you are?

05:54.767 --> 05:56.067
- Irritated with my husband?

05:56.067 --> 05:57.333
- You're always going on
about me being a snob.

05:57.333 --> 05:59.300
Who's the snob now?

05:59.300 --> 06:00.700
- I am not a snob.

06:00.700 --> 06:02.733
Otherwise, I wouldn't
be carrying the bag.

06:02.733 --> 06:04.400
- Hiding the bag.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.167
- It's not that I
mind that it's a fake.

06:06.167 --> 06:08.500
It's just, it's, it's, it's...

06:08.500 --> 06:09.867
- That it's a fake.

06:09.867 --> 06:10.700
- Bye bye now.

06:11.667 --> 06:14.267
(upbeat music)

06:18.333 --> 06:20.600
- Mm, this is the single origin?

06:20.600 --> 06:22.867
Because last time, I definitely
got the sweet apricot notes,

06:22.867 --> 06:24.200
but I felt there
was a bitter tinge.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.567
- Maybe you should try some.

06:25.567 --> 06:26.400
- Bright idea.

06:28.133 --> 06:29.700
Oh, snap.

06:31.100 --> 06:33.667
Oh, a couple of
babyccinos for the kids.

06:33.667 --> 06:36.067
- I'll be in the car
in my booster seat.

06:36.067 --> 06:37.600
- No, no, no, you
might spill it.

06:43.900 --> 06:46.100
Carlo, why is everyone
wearing my shirt?

06:47.100 --> 06:48.533
- Oh ,yeah.

06:48.533 --> 06:50.133
We decided to get a
uniform, something smart.

06:50.133 --> 06:51.433
- So everyone's wearing them?

06:51.433 --> 06:52.667
Must have cost you a fortune.

06:52.667 --> 06:54.700
- Think they came
out at $12 a piece.

06:54.700 --> 06:55.900
We found this great
uniform factory

06:55.900 --> 06:57.067
that does them in bulk.

06:58.633 --> 07:00.167
Bitter?

07:00.167 --> 07:01.067
- No.

07:01.067 --> 07:02.767
Wear what you like.

07:02.767 --> 07:05.333
(upbeat music)

07:06.233 --> 07:07.667
- What difference does it make

07:07.667 --> 07:09.200
if you have the same
shirt as the coffee guys?

07:09.200 --> 07:10.500
- Because two women
in there just asked me

07:10.500 --> 07:12.500
for long macchiatos.

07:12.500 --> 07:13.767
I had this shirt first.

07:13.767 --> 07:14.967
It's mine.

07:14.967 --> 07:16.300
- Dad just doesn't
want to wear something

07:16.300 --> 07:17.500
that you can buy in bulk.

07:17.500 --> 07:18.333
- What's wrong with that?

07:18.333 --> 07:19.533
I bought this premium,

07:19.533 --> 07:21.067
and then, two weeks later,

07:21.067 --> 07:22.400
everyone's buying
it off of a pallet.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.933
- And if everyone's wearing it,

07:23.933 --> 07:25.533
no one can tell you paid a
lot more money for yours.

07:25.533 --> 07:26.433
- Exactly.

07:26.433 --> 07:27.333
No, no, no, no, no.

07:27.333 --> 07:29.133
This is not about money.

07:29.133 --> 07:31.067
Oh, fine, you know,
I don't even care.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.367
And we're not telling
your mother about this.

07:34.367 --> 07:35.200
You understand?

07:35.200 --> 07:36.400
The shirt's fine.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.600
I'm not a snob.

07:37.600 --> 07:40.333
(cheerful music)

07:42.367 --> 07:43.633
- Whoa.

07:43.633 --> 07:45.800
Is that the sickest
thing you've ever seen?

07:45.800 --> 07:47.400
- [Margaret] Quite possibly.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.667
- Thanks, Margo.

07:48.667 --> 07:50.567
I've only got two kidneys to go.

07:50.567 --> 07:51.767
Ta, Brianna.

07:51.767 --> 07:53.533
Hey, Margo, you
should look inside.

07:53.533 --> 07:55.167
Cassie's got wicked stuff.

07:55.167 --> 07:56.800
- I couldn't agree more.

07:56.800 --> 08:00.167
Nasty, cheap imports
with hefty price tags.

08:00.167 --> 08:01.867
- Wicked means good, Margaret.

08:01.867 --> 08:05.867
- Have you seen the
pineapple laundry hamper?

08:05.867 --> 08:08.833
- That would look fantastic
in the beach house.

08:08.833 --> 08:10.067
And I will give you a call

08:10.067 --> 08:12.400
as soon as the covered
pinch pots are in.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.200
Isn't he something?

08:14.200 --> 08:16.300
Kayne, you're stopping
people in the street.

08:16.300 --> 08:17.500
- Oh, I can move the ladder.

08:17.500 --> 08:19.067
- You're bringing
people into the shop.

08:19.067 --> 08:20.800
I told you we'd get your
name out there, didn't I?

08:20.800 --> 08:22.800
Ooh, it's all happening for you.

08:22.800 --> 08:23.733
- For him?

08:23.733 --> 08:25.567
- Wow, I have to pinch myself.

08:25.567 --> 08:27.533
Hey, Brianna, can
you do me a solid

08:27.533 --> 08:29.067
and get some more pink fluoro?

08:30.433 --> 08:32.667
- [Margaret] Isn't Cassie
covering the costs?

08:32.667 --> 08:33.667
- I supply the paint.

08:33.667 --> 08:35.233
Cassie supplies the canvas.

08:35.233 --> 08:36.400
- And then she pays you.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.633
- The payment is getting
my name out there.

08:38.633 --> 08:41.067
- He should be
getting paid for this.

08:41.067 --> 08:42.500
Cassie said people are stopping

08:42.500 --> 08:44.400
and buying her pinch
pots because of him.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.333
- Margaret, this is 2016.

08:46.333 --> 08:48.900
It's like how the intern thing
is really catching on here.

08:48.900 --> 08:51.500
Kayne should probably be paying
Cassie for the opportunity.

08:51.500 --> 08:53.067
- Kayne is painting a wall.

08:53.067 --> 08:54.867
He should be paid
for painting a wall.

08:54.867 --> 08:57.400
- Yeah, if he was a
tradie painting it white.

08:57.400 --> 08:59.200
He's expressing his art.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.767
You can't put a price on art.

09:01.967 --> 09:03.167
(paint spraying)

09:03.167 --> 09:07.133
(phone buzzing
and playing music)

09:07.133 --> 09:08.067
- Yeah?

09:08.067 --> 09:10.500
- I'm worried about Kayne.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.567
- You're a bit fuckin'
late to the party.

09:13.800 --> 09:16.300
- Are you aware that
he's not being paid

09:16.300 --> 09:17.700
for painting the shop?

09:17.700 --> 09:19.333
- Did he not do it properly?

09:19.333 --> 09:21.167
- There was never
a plan to pay him.

09:21.167 --> 09:22.600
- Why are you interested?

09:22.600 --> 09:23.833
What's in it for you?

09:23.833 --> 09:26.900
- Same as there is
for Kayne, nothing.

09:26.900 --> 09:30.067
I thought that you, as the
family's financial controller,

09:30.067 --> 09:33.267
would understand that he should
be paid for his services.

09:33.267 --> 09:34.233
- Hang on.

09:36.267 --> 09:38.667
Did you give a quote
for the paint job?

09:38.667 --> 09:39.600
- No.

09:39.600 --> 09:41.133
- Sign a contract?

09:41.133 --> 09:42.067
- No.

09:42.067 --> 09:42.933
- Why not?

09:42.933 --> 09:44.133
- It's not a paint job.

09:44.133 --> 09:46.200
It's my picture
with my name on it,

09:46.200 --> 09:47.600
so my name's out there.

09:47.600 --> 09:50.100
- Did you spell it
right this time, Kanye?

09:50.100 --> 09:52.333
- Why did Brianna have
to tell everyone that!

09:53.533 --> 09:54.733
- Here, look, you
can't expect someone

09:54.733 --> 09:56.100
to pay an unknown artist.

09:56.100 --> 09:57.067
- Oh, for heavens sake, Amber,

09:57.067 --> 09:58.467
he's not an unknown artist.

09:58.467 --> 10:00.433
He's painted a shop!

10:00.433 --> 10:01.967
- It's an amazing feeling

10:01.967 --> 10:03.633
to be recognized
as an artist, bro.

10:03.633 --> 10:04.967
- Oh, that's really cool.

10:04.967 --> 10:06.967
- One lady came in and said,

10:06.967 --> 10:10.067
"Wow, what have you
done to the wall?"

10:10.067 --> 10:12.267
- That is very high praise.

10:12.267 --> 10:13.433
- We're super proud, mate.

10:13.433 --> 10:15.033
- Can't wait to see it.

10:15.033 --> 10:17.067
- Have you left any
space for our logo?

10:17.067 --> 10:17.900
- Wayne, don't!

10:17.900 --> 10:18.733
- I'm kidding.

10:19.900 --> 10:21.400
- You know he's not
getting paid for this?

10:21.400 --> 10:22.633
Margaret told me.

10:22.633 --> 10:24.167
- Margaret is way too
worried about money.

10:24.167 --> 10:26.933
I told her, artists aren't
supposed to be cashed up.

10:26.933 --> 10:29.433
They're supposed to
be poor and sick,

10:29.433 --> 10:32.233
and what was that guy
who cut off his ears?

10:32.233 --> 10:35.300
- Chopper Read, but
he mainly wrote books.

10:35.300 --> 10:37.100
- I'm very glad to
have brought this up.

10:37.100 --> 10:38.633
When's the next Mensa meeting?

10:38.633 --> 10:39.900
- Oh, Mom, if you're worried,

10:39.900 --> 10:41.733
you could pay Kayne
to paint my room.

10:41.733 --> 10:43.433
- I'll never be that
fuckin' worried.

10:43.433 --> 10:44.700
- Okay, everyone
just stop stressing.

10:44.700 --> 10:46.267
Kayne is having a great time.

10:46.267 --> 10:48.033
(Kayne burps)

10:48.033 --> 10:49.233
- Yes, I am.

10:49.233 --> 10:50.500
- We're the lucky ones.

10:50.500 --> 10:52.133
Not only do we get to
look at Kayne's art,

10:52.133 --> 10:54.300
we get to drink out of it.

10:54.300 --> 10:55.600
To Kayne.

10:55.600 --> 10:56.633
- To Kanye.

10:56.633 --> 10:59.033
- Stop telling people!

10:59.033 --> 11:00.800
I was excited.

11:00.800 --> 11:03.367
(upbeat music)

11:45.300 --> 11:47.833
(upbeat music)

12:01.967 --> 12:03.200
- What are you doing?

12:04.067 --> 12:05.567
- Nothing. What?

12:05.567 --> 12:08.133
- You're throwing out your
popular clothes, aren't you?

12:08.133 --> 12:09.467
- I'm doing no such thing.

12:09.467 --> 12:10.867
- Really?

12:10.867 --> 12:12.800
I think Mom's yoga
instructor has that shirt.

12:12.800 --> 12:15.333
- Um, I'm just
looking for something.

12:15.333 --> 12:16.833
- Is it your book
on how to be cool?

12:16.833 --> 12:19.100
Because I'm pretty sure that
never arrived from Amazon.

12:19.100 --> 12:21.467
- Sorry, why aren't
you at school?

12:21.467 --> 12:23.133
- I'm like you, I
have a late start.

12:23.133 --> 12:24.067
Can you drive me?

12:24.067 --> 12:25.267
- Well, your mom took the car.

12:25.267 --> 12:27.067
But even if she
hadn't, I wouldn't.

12:27.067 --> 12:28.700
So how's that for cool?

12:29.667 --> 12:30.933
- That was a burn,

12:30.933 --> 12:32.833
which, technically, is
the opposite of cool.

12:35.600 --> 12:37.767
- No, because you can
get a burn from ice,

12:37.767 --> 12:38.867
and that's cold.

12:41.100 --> 12:43.700
(upbeat music)

12:58.267 --> 13:00.733
(door creaks)

13:04.067 --> 13:05.633
- Oh.

13:05.633 --> 13:07.300
I thought you were out.

13:07.300 --> 13:08.567
- No, I'm back.

13:08.567 --> 13:09.767
I'm here.

13:09.767 --> 13:11.133
But I will be going
out again soon,

13:11.133 --> 13:13.067
because Wayne and
Julie are picking me up

13:13.067 --> 13:14.833
to go and see a
wall, Kayne's wall.

13:14.833 --> 13:16.433
So that will be
good to see them.

13:16.433 --> 13:17.367
What's that?

13:17.367 --> 13:18.233
- What?

13:18.233 --> 13:19.533
- That bag in your hand.

13:19.533 --> 13:23.400
- Oh, that's just some
stuff for the op shop.

13:23.400 --> 13:24.300
- Why are you throwing
away that shirt?

13:24.300 --> 13:25.333
You love that shirt.

13:25.333 --> 13:26.167
- Which shirt?

13:26.167 --> 13:28.167
- The Hugo Boss one.

13:28.167 --> 13:29.367
- Which one's that one?

13:29.367 --> 13:30.667
- [Bess] The blue and
white checked one.

13:30.667 --> 13:31.933
- Oh, yeah.

13:31.933 --> 13:34.233
I just felt guilty
that not everyone

13:34.233 --> 13:35.667
can afford a shirt like that,

13:35.667 --> 13:37.100
and I thought I shouldn't
wait till it's old.

13:37.100 --> 13:38.633
I should share it when it's new.

13:38.633 --> 13:41.133
- Oh, that's really nice.

13:41.133 --> 13:42.400
- Yeah.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.700
That's just my way of
giving back, you know,

13:43.700 --> 13:45.800
just everybody wins.

13:45.800 --> 13:48.700
Salvos win and so does the
guy looking for a $2 shirt.

13:48.700 --> 13:49.633
- Yeah.

13:49.633 --> 13:51.100
He gets it at cost price.

13:51.100 --> 13:52.567
- Which makes me
think, you know,

13:52.567 --> 13:55.467
I don't think we should buy
so much expensive stuff.

13:55.467 --> 13:57.133
Do you know what I mean?

13:57.133 --> 13:57.967
Hmm.

13:57.967 --> 13:59.233
- Yeah.

13:59.233 --> 14:01.867
Hey, why are you
sitting down there

14:01.867 --> 14:04.300
when he could be lying up here?

14:04.300 --> 14:05.967
- It's a yoga thing.

14:05.967 --> 14:07.567
- Mm.

14:07.567 --> 14:09.467
Does your instructor
wear White Linen?

14:10.400 --> 14:13.300
(musical horn honking)

14:13.300 --> 14:17.333
- I can drop this
bag off on the way.

14:17.333 --> 14:20.200
Be part of the giving back
movement that you've started.

14:23.667 --> 14:24.500
- Nice handbag.

14:26.133 --> 14:27.067
- Do you think we
could drop these off

14:27.067 --> 14:28.300
at the op shop on the way?

14:28.300 --> 14:30.067
- Too easy.

14:30.067 --> 14:31.600
- Careful, they're exp.

14:31.600 --> 14:32.667
Doesn't matter.

14:32.667 --> 14:34.433
- You know what this is, Bess?

14:34.433 --> 14:36.333
The humble beginnings
of the artist.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.833
(phone ringing)

14:38.833 --> 14:39.767
- See her handbag, babe?

14:39.767 --> 14:41.400
Really suits her, doesn't it?

14:43.133 --> 14:44.067
- Hi, Mom.

14:44.067 --> 14:45.400
Yeah, no, we're all still here.

14:45.400 --> 14:47.400
Well, I'm not sure
how long we'll be.

14:47.400 --> 14:48.500
Yeah, well how long
do you think you'll-

14:48.500 --> 14:49.900
- Look!

14:49.900 --> 14:50.833
Look! Look!

14:52.400 --> 14:53.967
Look what she's done!

14:53.967 --> 14:56.200
I've come directly
from my bridge morning,

14:56.200 --> 14:58.667
where Eleanor served
coffee in these!

14:58.667 --> 15:00.533
- Dad, that's my
painting, sweet!

15:00.533 --> 15:01.300
- Sweet?

15:01.300 --> 15:02.500
That woman!

15:02.500 --> 15:05.100
That woman is on a
copy and paste frenzy.

15:05.100 --> 15:07.667
(upbeat music)

15:16.667 --> 15:17.933
- [Kanye] How awesome is this?

15:17.933 --> 15:19.467
- You really have
made the big time.

15:19.467 --> 15:20.700
- The big time?

15:20.700 --> 15:23.067
- I've got 7,000
followers on Instagram.

15:23.067 --> 15:25.867
- So what do you think?

15:25.867 --> 15:29.467
- Ooh, I love, love, love it!

15:29.467 --> 15:30.900
You should buy it.

15:30.900 --> 15:32.933
- Julie will do no such thing.

15:32.933 --> 15:35.867
Not until you settle
the payment issue.

15:35.867 --> 15:37.167
- There's no payment issue.

15:37.167 --> 15:39.933
- You have used Kayne's image.

15:39.933 --> 15:41.433
- No, I've used my image.

15:41.433 --> 15:42.633
That's on my wall.

15:42.633 --> 15:44.100
I own it.

15:44.100 --> 15:47.067
- You cannot take
someone's work and use it-

15:47.067 --> 15:48.400
- I did the work, lady.

15:48.400 --> 15:50.100
I was the one Skyping
Beijing at two in the morning

15:50.100 --> 15:52.600
working out the right
quantities for the mouse pads.

15:52.600 --> 15:54.267
He should be grateful
that he's name's

15:54.267 --> 15:55.800
gonna be out there-
- His name is not out there.

15:55.800 --> 15:58.267
All that's out there is a pile
of cheap cups and place mats.

15:58.267 --> 16:00.100
- Ooh, I didn't
see the place mats.

16:00.100 --> 16:01.300
We should grab some, babe.

16:01.300 --> 16:02.533
- You got any of
those head torches.

16:02.533 --> 16:03.800
They'd look great at work.

16:03.800 --> 16:05.900
- Wayne, Julie, enough!

16:05.900 --> 16:09.067
- Margaret, this could lead
to something for Kayne.

16:09.067 --> 16:10.300
- It's led to something,

16:10.300 --> 16:11.933
that woman making a
whole lot of money.

16:11.933 --> 16:14.200
- Oh, sorry if
you're a socialist.

16:14.200 --> 16:15.733
- How dare you.

16:15.733 --> 16:18.333
She made money out
of Kayne's idea.

16:18.333 --> 16:19.667
He created the image.

16:19.667 --> 16:21.433
He conceived it and
drew it and painted it.

16:21.433 --> 16:23.167
Here is the artist!

16:24.167 --> 16:28.067
Good grief, you're an artist.

16:28.067 --> 16:30.367
- And I'm showing his art.

16:31.933 --> 16:35.733
- No, I'm showing his art.

16:35.733 --> 16:38.600
(upbeat music)

16:38.600 --> 16:41.400
- I thought I'd only ever see
that on Mom's shoulder blade.

16:41.400 --> 16:42.767
How can I ever thank you?

16:42.767 --> 16:44.233
- Not like this.

16:44.233 --> 16:45.600
You can just get those
last two canvases finished

16:45.600 --> 16:46.933
before tomorrow night.

16:46.933 --> 16:50.067
- Platypus and a
dingo, comin' at ya.

16:50.067 --> 16:52.500
- Are you sure you can be
out again in two weeks?

16:52.500 --> 16:54.833
I've promise the space
to the ladies auxiliary.

16:54.833 --> 16:56.067
- You should be pleased
to have something

16:56.067 --> 16:57.433
fresh in here for a change.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.200
I've been looking at
the same bowl of fruit

16:59.200 --> 17:01.233
they've been painting
for 15 years.

17:01.233 --> 17:03.933
- Anyone can throw on a
few splashes of color.

17:03.933 --> 17:07.367
It's very hard to paint a
realistic bowl of bananas.

17:07.367 --> 17:10.767
- Ah, gorgeous, Kayne.

17:10.767 --> 17:12.500
Hey, where do you
want these, Marg?

17:12.500 --> 17:14.800
- I want them back in the box.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.100
- Oh, I thought it
would be good to show

17:16.100 --> 17:18.167
some of Kayne's work
from his early years.

17:18.167 --> 17:21.500
Plus, I've also got some of
Brianna's pasta paintings,

17:21.500 --> 17:24.400
which were standouts
in her class.

17:24.400 --> 17:25.400
- Where are we
settin' up the merch?

17:25.400 --> 17:28.067
- There is no merch.

17:28.067 --> 17:30.067
- I thought the whole point
of this was to make money.

17:30.067 --> 17:31.733
- And no children's artwork,

17:31.733 --> 17:34.067
especially not Brianna's
pasta paintings.

17:34.067 --> 17:35.300
- I'll buy the pasta paintings.

17:35.300 --> 17:37.933
- Can we keep the
penne Christmas tree?

17:37.933 --> 17:40.567
- This is about Kayne
being introduced

17:40.567 --> 17:43.367
to the world as
an artist, per se.

17:43.367 --> 17:44.600
- Per se.

17:44.600 --> 17:45.867
I didn't know he was
changing his name.

17:45.867 --> 17:47.433
That is gangster.

17:47.433 --> 17:50.200
- Kayne will be purely
expressing his art here,

17:50.200 --> 17:52.800
not selling any cushions
or mugs or mouse pads.

17:52.800 --> 17:54.600
- You really think
someone's gonna pay money

17:54.600 --> 17:57.300
for that big painting when
you can't do anything with it?

17:57.300 --> 18:00.067
- What you do with it is
to hang it on the wall

18:00.067 --> 18:01.400
and contemplate it.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.300
- I prefer a 65-inch Samsung.

18:03.300 --> 18:06.867
- We'll see what you prefer
when Kayne sells one of these.

18:08.667 --> 18:11.333
- Oh, you can't sell
it for that much!

18:11.333 --> 18:12.367
- Watch me.

18:14.867 --> 18:16.267
- Get the fuck home and finish

18:16.267 --> 18:17.933
that platypus in
the lounge room.

18:17.933 --> 18:18.767
- Ugh.

18:18.767 --> 18:21.333
(gentle music)

18:25.300 --> 18:26.500
- Hey, Pop, think quick.

18:27.700 --> 18:29.133
- Shawny, I've told
ya, only throw stuff

18:29.133 --> 18:30.233
at me on my good side.

18:30.233 --> 18:31.500
- My bad, Pop.

18:31.500 --> 18:33.767
- Oops, I forgot to
drop that stuff off.

18:33.767 --> 18:35.600
Haven't you boys
loaded those yet?

18:35.600 --> 18:36.833
Margaret'll be getting panicky.

18:36.833 --> 18:38.300
- Hellsville Sanctuary.

18:38.300 --> 18:40.267
- Kayne can't decide what
to name the paintings.

18:40.267 --> 18:41.667
- Margaret said
it's very important

18:41.667 --> 18:43.100
to get the right
names from the works.

18:43.100 --> 18:44.267
And what if I get
the wrong ones?

18:44.267 --> 18:45.533
And what if no one likes them?

18:45.533 --> 18:47.067
And what if they're
not good paintings?

18:47.067 --> 18:49.367
- Okay, you know how your
mom gets before a big race?

18:49.367 --> 18:50.567
When she yells at us

18:50.567 --> 18:51.367
and tells us to
get out of the way?

18:51.367 --> 18:52.600
- And she cries a bit.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.067
- And sends you
out for ice cream.

18:54.067 --> 18:55.333
- And then says she
can't fit in her pants.

18:55.333 --> 18:56.600
- And yells at you again.

18:56.600 --> 18:59.100
- Okay, the point
is, she's nervous.

18:59.100 --> 19:00.400
It's her big moment.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.133
Just like this is
your big moment.

19:02.133 --> 19:03.967
It doesn't matter what
the paintings are called,

19:03.967 --> 19:06.133
people are gonna love 'em.

19:10.633 --> 19:11.467
- No.

19:13.800 --> 19:14.600
Yeah.

19:17.667 --> 19:19.267
- You've certainly come
around to using the fake bag.

19:19.267 --> 19:20.667
You're taking it everywhere.

19:20.667 --> 19:21.867
- Huh, fake smake.

19:21.867 --> 19:22.833
- Not a word.

19:22.833 --> 19:25.533
- Oscar, we're gonna be late!

19:25.533 --> 19:27.367
Are you just wearing that?

19:27.367 --> 19:29.133
Aren't you gonna get
changed into a shirt?

19:29.133 --> 19:30.633
- No.

19:30.633 --> 19:32.767
- Well, I think the opening's
a bit more dressy than that.

19:32.767 --> 19:35.500
- I think a T-shirt's dressy
enough for Kayne's opening.

19:35.500 --> 19:36.733
- Haven't you noticed?

19:36.733 --> 19:38.200
Dad's only wearing
black T-shirts now.

19:38.200 --> 19:39.067
It's his new thing.

19:39.067 --> 19:40.267
- It's not my thing.

19:40.267 --> 19:41.233
I'm just paring
back, that's all.

19:41.233 --> 19:42.200
Where is Oscar?

19:42.200 --> 19:43.567
- Actually, yes!

19:43.567 --> 19:45.067
Have you got a new gay client?

19:45.067 --> 19:46.067
- Oh.
- Are you flirting?

19:46.067 --> 19:47.533
- What?

19:47.533 --> 19:48.533
- Well, I know that you like
to look a little bit muscly.

19:48.533 --> 19:49.733
- I'm living simply.

19:49.733 --> 19:50.967
- I thought it was
because you don't want

19:50.967 --> 19:52.467
to look the same
as everyone else.

19:52.467 --> 19:55.200
- You weren't supposed to
tell Mom that, remember?

19:55.200 --> 19:56.067
- [Oscar] Oh, yeah.

19:56.067 --> 19:56.867
- Tell me what?

19:56.867 --> 19:58.267
- Nothing.

19:58.267 --> 19:59.767
- Dad's not a snob,

19:59.767 --> 20:01.400
except he freaked out when
all the coffee shop guys

20:01.400 --> 20:02.567
had the same shirt as he did,

20:02.567 --> 20:04.267
so he started only
wearing black T-shirts.

20:04.267 --> 20:06.600
- Is that why you got
rid of all those shirts?

20:06.600 --> 20:07.433
- No.
- I knew you

20:07.433 --> 20:08.667
were throwing them out!

20:08.667 --> 20:09.900
He threw away all
that money, Mom,

20:09.900 --> 20:11.500
just because he was
socially embarrassed.

20:11.500 --> 20:12.367
- Ah.

20:13.567 --> 20:16.300
Oh, well, if that's how
your father was feeling.

20:16.300 --> 20:17.900
We should go.

20:17.900 --> 20:19.467
- Oh, well?

20:19.467 --> 20:20.967
That's all you get?

20:20.967 --> 20:21.833
- Oh, well.

20:22.867 --> 20:25.467
(upbeat music)

20:33.933 --> 20:36.400
- I am so delighted
to be presenting

20:36.400 --> 20:39.033
the work of Kayne Wheeler,

20:39.033 --> 20:42.933
one of our most exciting
emerging artists.

20:42.933 --> 20:46.733
In the tradition of other
great voices from the suburbs,

20:46.733 --> 20:50.467
like Howard Arkley,
Kayne Wheeler transposed

20:50.467 --> 20:54.633
his immediate surrounds to
formulate his unique expression.

20:54.633 --> 20:56.500
Kayne has crisscrossed Australia

20:56.500 --> 21:01.233
attending top fuel drag
racing meets since birth,

21:01.233 --> 21:04.200
and these rural
bitumen wastelands

21:04.200 --> 21:06.100
- It's a good fit, isn't it?
- became the canvas

21:06.100 --> 21:07.333
- It's a bit snug
around the shoulders,

21:07.333 --> 21:09.567
but Jules says it makes
me look a bit muscly.

21:09.567 --> 21:10.900
There were some
goodies in that bag.

21:10.900 --> 21:12.300
We all went through it.

21:12.300 --> 21:14.900
Jules has pegged the
white shirt for Zumba.

21:16.200 --> 21:18.400
Are you sure you want
to chuck this one out?

21:19.467 --> 21:20.967
- Oh yeah.

21:20.967 --> 21:22.433
I'm very happy in just
something plainer.

21:22.433 --> 21:26.667
- And his art is fueled by
both his boundless imagination

21:26.667 --> 21:28.700
and a charming playfulness,

21:28.700 --> 21:31.333
which manage to conjure
a titillating vision

21:31.333 --> 21:33.800
of the outer urban psyche.

21:33.800 --> 21:36.700
What at first glance
appears to be a flirtatious

21:36.700 --> 21:38.967
dance with popular culture

21:38.967 --> 21:43.367
on further inspection transcends
into a deep commentary

21:43.367 --> 21:45.600
on the nature of existence.

21:45.600 --> 21:48.367
I'm sure you will
all be as exhilarated

21:48.367 --> 21:50.400
as I am by the
entire collection,

21:50.400 --> 21:54.900
but it is this, his
signature work entitled-

21:54.900 --> 21:56.767
- "Top Fueled Barbecue."

21:58.400 --> 21:59.433
- Yes.

21:59.433 --> 22:00.767
This work is the real deal.

22:00.767 --> 22:03.167
Not some cheap facsimile
on a tea towel.

22:03.167 --> 22:07.433
It is an outstanding work
of truth and integrity.

22:07.433 --> 22:10.233
And I fully anticipate
it will be snapped up

22:10.233 --> 22:12.400
before the evening is over.

22:12.400 --> 22:15.867
Please enjoy Kayne Wheeler!

22:15.867 --> 22:18.433
(crowd cheers)

22:20.900 --> 22:22.733
- What happened to Per Se?

22:23.600 --> 22:24.600
- Woo!

22:24.600 --> 22:27.167
(upbeat music)

22:33.667 --> 22:38.067
- Oh, about two, 2 1/2
weeks to do all of them.

22:38.067 --> 22:40.700
- After a rigorous
period of formulating

22:40.700 --> 22:42.967
the intellectual ideas
behind the collection.

22:42.967 --> 22:44.500
- Oh, yeah.

22:44.500 --> 22:46.900
I've been doodling while I'm
on the phone for like ever.

22:46.900 --> 22:48.200
- These-
- Smoked trout

22:48.200 --> 22:51.067
cantaloupe phyllo cigars
with mustard dill sauce.

22:51.067 --> 22:53.067
- Are fucking nine bucks a pop!

22:53.067 --> 22:55.200
Kayne's had 15 of
them, he's so excited.

22:55.200 --> 22:56.467
In order to pay for these

22:56.467 --> 22:57.967
and the champagne
and the gallery,

22:57.967 --> 23:00.133
we are gonna have to
sell everything here.

23:00.133 --> 23:01.067
- Calm down.

23:01.067 --> 23:02.067
The paintings are selling.

23:02.067 --> 23:03.233
- Some of the smaller ones are,

23:03.233 --> 23:04.633
but what about his
signature work?

23:04.633 --> 23:05.600
Wasn't that the point of this,

23:05.600 --> 23:06.867
to prove that doesn't need to be

23:06.867 --> 23:08.633
on a beach bag in order
for someone to want it?

23:08.633 --> 23:10.400
- It doesn't need
to be on a beach bag

23:10.400 --> 23:12.567
or an egg cup or a head
torch for it to sell,

23:12.567 --> 23:13.567
which it will.

23:13.567 --> 23:14.400
- Pff.

23:15.733 --> 23:18.233
(gentle music)

23:18.233 --> 23:20.300
- There are red dots
going up everywhere!

23:20.300 --> 23:21.367
Can you believe it?

23:21.367 --> 23:23.067
- Uh, no, actually I can't.

23:25.067 --> 23:26.933
Why did you give
Wayne all my shirts?

23:26.933 --> 23:27.867
- I didn't mean to.

23:27.867 --> 23:29.367
He forgot to drop the bag off.

23:29.367 --> 23:31.233
He looks pretty good in
them, though, doesn't he?

23:31.233 --> 23:33.200
He'd fitter than I thought.

23:33.200 --> 23:34.967
- Yes, he looks good.

23:34.967 --> 23:36.467
It's a very nice shirt.

23:37.667 --> 23:40.900
- I think you look
very sexy in this one.

23:40.900 --> 23:41.733
- Yeah?

23:41.733 --> 23:43.233
- Yup.

23:43.233 --> 23:44.600
- More than all the other
guys here in black T-shirts?

23:44.600 --> 23:46.233
- More than all the other guy.

23:46.233 --> 23:47.067
Oh!

23:47.067 --> 23:48.067
(glass shattering)

23:48.067 --> 23:49.400
I'm so sorry.

23:49.400 --> 23:50.933
I've got tissues.

23:50.933 --> 23:52.333
(gasps) Oh my God.

23:52.333 --> 23:53.567
- I'm so sorry.

23:53.567 --> 23:54.800
We're not accustomed to crowds

23:54.800 --> 23:56.433
at our fruit exhibitions.

23:56.433 --> 23:57.633
- We need to go home now.

23:57.633 --> 23:59.400
I have to clean this up.

23:59.400 --> 24:00.400
- Mom, it's fine.

24:00.400 --> 24:01.200
- It isn't.

24:01.200 --> 24:02.133
I have to fix this.

24:02.133 --> 24:02.967
- Okay, peg it back.

24:02.967 --> 24:04.200
Lots of people.
- No!

24:04.200 --> 24:05.400
I've got to get this stain out!

24:05.400 --> 24:06.500
- I thought you'd be
happy to have an excuse

24:06.500 --> 24:07.867
not to use the fake bag.

24:09.400 --> 24:10.733
- Excuse me.

24:10.733 --> 24:12.367
- You bought the
real bag, didn't you?

24:12.367 --> 24:13.600
How much did that cost?

24:13.600 --> 24:15.567
- About as much as
your bag of shirts.

24:15.567 --> 24:17.067
- I can't believe you
were too embarrassed

24:17.067 --> 24:18.067
to carry cheap bag.

24:18.067 --> 24:19.133
- It's not about being cheap.

24:19.133 --> 24:20.567
It's about being real.

24:20.567 --> 24:22.433
I have no problem
carrying a cheap handbag,

24:22.433 --> 24:25.200
but I have a huge problem
carrying a cheap handbag

24:25.200 --> 24:28.467
that is pretending
to be expensive.

24:28.467 --> 24:29.933
Oh, God, is that me?

24:29.933 --> 24:31.067
Am I talking about me?

24:31.067 --> 24:32.333
- [Danny] Mm.

24:32.333 --> 24:33.567
- So instead of just
saying all of that,

24:33.567 --> 24:34.833
you went and bought the
really expensive bag?

24:34.833 --> 24:36.300
- Mm hmm.

24:36.300 --> 24:38.800
- And you threw away all
of your expensive clothing.

24:38.800 --> 24:40.300
I want to go to boarding school.

24:40.300 --> 24:41.533
- Can't afford it.

24:41.533 --> 24:42.667
- No, not my bag.

24:42.667 --> 24:44.200
- Oh, it's your bag?

24:44.200 --> 24:45.267
I'm so sorry.

24:45.267 --> 24:46.433
- Yes, so you should be.

24:46.433 --> 24:48.367
It cost me $12.

24:48.367 --> 24:49.767
It was a knockoff.

24:49.767 --> 24:50.833
- I don't think so.

24:50.833 --> 24:52.067
- Go on, show 'em, Bess.

24:52.067 --> 24:53.333
- No, I don't think we need

24:53.333 --> 24:54.767
to show them that it's
a knockoff from Bali.

24:54.767 --> 24:55.600
Definitely.

24:56.900 --> 24:59.200
Actually, it's a funny story.

24:59.200 --> 25:02.567
- The giveaway is the F
in this tiny writing here.

25:02.567 --> 25:03.400
- What happened was that-

25:03.400 --> 25:04.633
- The F is backwards.

25:04.633 --> 25:06.900
You see how it's
facing the wrong way?

25:06.900 --> 25:08.533
That's the tell there.

25:08.533 --> 25:10.867
- Oh, yes, I had no idea.

25:10.867 --> 25:12.633
- This is the fake?

25:12.633 --> 25:15.833
(laughs) This is a fake.

25:17.067 --> 25:18.933
- You bought a real
one so you didn't have

25:18.933 --> 25:20.167
to carry the cheap one,

25:20.167 --> 25:22.067
and now you can't
tell the difference.

25:22.067 --> 25:24.167
I'm paying for my
own boarding school.

25:24.167 --> 25:26.867
(upbeat music)

25:26.867 --> 25:28.467
- Red dot!

25:28.467 --> 25:29.467
There's a red dot!

25:30.633 --> 25:32.133
Yes!

25:32.133 --> 25:32.967
Yow!

25:34.600 --> 25:36.067
Yes!

25:36.067 --> 25:38.733
(elegant music)

25:43.633 --> 25:44.467
- You sold it?

25:44.467 --> 25:46.100
- What did I tell you?

25:46.100 --> 25:47.767
- Who bought it?

25:47.767 --> 25:49.300
- True appreciators of art

25:49.300 --> 25:51.533
never want their
names out there.

25:53.733 --> 25:56.300
(upbeat music)

26:02.400 --> 26:04.800
- From Kayne, a thank you gift.

26:04.800 --> 26:05.633
- Oh.

26:05.633 --> 26:07.067
- He's a very sweet boy.

26:08.267 --> 26:09.500
I'll put this up in
the top spare room.

26:09.500 --> 26:11.367
No one ever goes in there.

26:11.367 --> 26:13.133
- I thought you liked his art.

26:13.133 --> 26:14.333
- Of course I don't like it.

26:14.333 --> 26:16.100
- You put on an
exhibition of his work.

26:16.100 --> 26:17.600
- That doesn't mean I like it.

26:17.600 --> 26:19.900
That means I respect his
right not to be exploited.

26:19.900 --> 26:21.133
And I wanted to show him

26:21.133 --> 26:22.733
that it was possible
to be paid for art

26:22.733 --> 26:24.467
that doesn't appear on a cup.

26:24.467 --> 26:26.833
- And you hate that woman
from Hospitable Homes.

26:26.833 --> 26:30.433
- And I hate that woman
from Hospitable Homes.

26:30.433 --> 26:32.133
- Do you mind if we have
lunch in the city today?

26:32.133 --> 26:34.067
I have to return something.

26:34.067 --> 26:35.533
- [Margaret] What?

26:35.533 --> 26:38.267
- Long story, just bought
something I shouldn't have.

26:39.800 --> 26:41.067
- I know the feeling.

26:41.900 --> 26:44.500
(upbeat music)

27:11.367 --> 27:14.100
(engine revving)
