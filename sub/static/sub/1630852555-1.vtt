00:03.003 --> 00:05.440
<i>We all look</i> <i>
at the world through</i> <i>
our own lens.</i>

00:05.483 --> 00:07.616
<i>But looking isn't</i> <i>
the same thing as seeing.</i>

00:07.659 --> 00:11.098
<i>What if everything you believed</i> <i>
about the world turned out</i> <i>
to be wrong?</i>

00:11.141 --> 00:15.189
<i>If we truly opened up our eyes,</i> <i>
what would we see?</i>

00:15.232 --> 00:19.541
<i>Every superhero</i> <i>
has an origin story,</i> <i>
and this is mine.</i>

00:38.951 --> 00:41.041
Hey, Naomi!
Hey!

00:41.084 --> 00:42.825
Naomi!

00:42.868 --> 00:44.566
Hey, Naomi, thanks
for the AP Lit notes.
Girl, you saved my life.

00:44.609 --> 00:47.264
- Anytime, lady.
Dostoevsky is no joke.
- Right.

00:47.308 --> 00:48.874
Oh!

00:48.918 --> 00:50.093
Damn, Naomi.

00:50.137 --> 00:52.748
Nice reflexes.
You want to join the team?

00:52.791 --> 00:55.098
Will we finally
win a game?

00:55.142 --> 00:58.319
- Yo, cameo time.

00:58.362 --> 00:59.972
You guys, check this out.

01:00.016 --> 01:03.759
Naomi runs the number three
Superman fan site in the world.

01:03.802 --> 01:05.935
Not for long. Brazil site
is number one,

01:05.978 --> 01:08.590
and the Philippines
is number two,
but I'm coming for them.

01:12.985 --> 01:16.337
For someone so fly,
you sure are into
some nerdy stuff.

01:16.380 --> 01:18.817
Mmm-hmm. I'm just saying.

01:18.861 --> 01:22.299
Superman? The guy
wears a cape and spandex.

01:22.343 --> 01:24.388
One or the other, acceptable.

01:24.432 --> 01:26.390
Both together?
I mean, come on.

01:26.434 --> 01:28.175
- Not the coolest.
- Incorrect.

01:28.218 --> 01:30.220
The <i>very</i> coolest.

01:30.264 --> 01:33.876
Who can shoot laser beams
from his frickin' eyes?
His eyes, man.

01:36.922 --> 01:40.143
But the best part?
He's adopted,

01:40.187 --> 01:41.449
which means he's extra-special,

01:41.492 --> 01:44.321
'cause adopted kids are chosen,
just like me.

01:46.106 --> 01:50.806
- But also,
he's not real. Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm!

01:50.849 --> 01:56.159
So? Einstein said,
"Reality is merely an illusion,

01:56.203 --> 01:59.075
albeit a persistent one."

01:59.119 --> 02:00.250
It was in our AP reading.

02:00.294 --> 02:01.773
Do you actually
take the class, Nathan,

02:01.817 --> 02:03.906
or you just sit there
and look pretty?

02:06.169 --> 02:07.170
You think I'm pretty?

02:08.302 --> 02:10.260
- Annabelle.
- OMG.

02:10.304 --> 02:12.393
Babe, you're like,
four hours late.
Where have you been?

02:12.436 --> 02:16.397
You know my parents
and their firm stance
on family dinner.

02:16.440 --> 02:20.836
- I thought this was ginger ale.
- I'm on it, hon.

02:20.879 --> 02:23.360
- Nathan sure knows
how to throw a party,

02:23.404 --> 02:26.102
and look damn, damn good
while doing it.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.845
Damn good.

02:29.888 --> 02:31.542
I hadn't noticed.

02:31.586 --> 02:34.197
Right, because you broke up
with that fine specimen
of a man

02:34.241 --> 02:35.329
after five dates?

02:35.372 --> 02:37.548
I don't know what
you're talking about.

02:38.245 --> 02:40.203
This is my jam.

02:41.987 --> 02:43.163
Yeah, Naomi!

03:05.533 --> 03:07.230
...ready
for the delegation,

03:07.274 --> 03:10.190
but we're only one stop
on their tour and he's
making us crazy.

03:10.233 --> 03:12.409
Hey. Morning, pumpkin.

03:12.453 --> 03:15.456
- Morning.
- Honestly, it's only two lines.

03:15.499 --> 03:17.240
Hello. It's a pleasure
to meet you.

03:17.284 --> 03:18.850
How hard is that?

03:18.894 --> 03:21.375
- I am a linguist,
not a miracle worker. <i>
- Bonjour.</i>

03:31.341 --> 03:34.475
Hello. It's a pleasure
to meet you.

03:34.518 --> 03:37.260
That...
That's my girl. Up top.

03:38.392 --> 03:39.480
Dad.

03:40.394 --> 03:41.656
What?

03:43.397 --> 03:45.703
Now high fives are out?

03:45.747 --> 03:49.272
Yes, like
ten years ago.

03:49.316 --> 03:52.144
- I like that better anyway.

03:52.188 --> 03:54.277
I didn't hear you
come in last night.
What time did you get home?

03:54.321 --> 03:56.192
I don't know. Midnight.

03:57.062 --> 03:59.630
Hmm, midnight.

03:59.674 --> 04:03.591
Yeah, I haven't stayed out
that late since 2009.

04:03.634 --> 04:06.420
We drove to Portland,
we saw Coldplay.

04:06.463 --> 04:08.944
- Remember, Jen?
- Gosh. I sure do.

04:08.987 --> 04:10.859
- We got our groove on.

04:10.902 --> 04:13.470
Yeah. Yeah, we did.
You still got your groove on.

04:13.514 --> 04:15.385
Oh, you know I do.

04:15.429 --> 04:18.823
It's a little early
for all of that, folks.

04:19.998 --> 04:22.131
Better hurry. Bell rings in 15.

04:22.174 --> 04:25.003
If you let me get a car,
you wouldn't have to worry
about me being late.

04:25.047 --> 04:27.354
Nice try. No driving
until graduation.

04:27.397 --> 04:28.703
Then these are
the only wheels I've got.

05:38.468 --> 05:40.514
Anthony? Hey.

05:40.557 --> 05:42.864
Missed you last night.
I thought you were
coming to the party.

05:45.519 --> 05:47.869
Your boy gave me
the wrong address.

05:47.912 --> 05:49.523
That's not how
you treat people.

05:49.566 --> 05:52.003
I'm sure it was a mistake.

05:52.047 --> 05:54.528
Come on. Why would Nathan
give you the wrong address?

05:54.571 --> 06:00.272
Military brats like him,
they hate townies
like me. It's...

06:00.316 --> 06:02.797
- They always have.
- It's a two-way street.

06:02.840 --> 06:05.626
Most townies aren't
so welcoming to new kids.

06:07.018 --> 06:10.152
Also, I'm a military brat
and I don't hate you.

06:10.195 --> 06:13.895
Yeah, but you're... you.

06:18.508 --> 06:22.643
- So...
- I'll see you in debate club
after school.

06:22.686 --> 06:24.993
Okay, so here's
how this is going to work.

06:25.036 --> 06:26.690
Commander's giving us
15 minutes--

06:26.734 --> 06:28.779
That's not enough time
for a real debate.

06:28.823 --> 06:31.347
Well, it's not a real debate.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.436
Our club has been chosen
to represent the school

06:33.480 --> 06:36.439
by presenting to the visiting
military delegation.

06:36.483 --> 06:38.528
Now, are we ready to begin?

06:44.621 --> 06:46.362
What's going on?

06:46.406 --> 06:47.842
Annabelle says there's
a stunt happening
in the square.

06:49.147 --> 06:52.542
Something to do
with... Superman.

06:54.326 --> 06:55.850
I need this for my site.

06:55.893 --> 06:57.242
Bathroom break. Ten minutes.

06:57.286 --> 06:58.287
I'll be right back.

07:54.561 --> 07:56.998
What happened?
Where did he go?

08:00.610 --> 08:03.874
It was like a scene
out of a movie.

08:03.918 --> 08:05.833
Sixty-five years
on this Earth,

08:05.876 --> 08:07.269
I've never seen
anything like it.

08:10.664 --> 08:13.014
I dropped my phone.
The Superman dude
was right there

08:13.057 --> 08:14.842
and I dropped my phone,

08:14.885 --> 08:17.453
- Annabelle!
- Naomi!

08:17.497 --> 08:19.194
Can you believe it?
Did you know about this?

08:19.237 --> 08:20.761
Because if you knew about this
and you didn't tell me,

08:20.804 --> 08:22.719
- I'm going to be so mad.
- I missed it.

08:22.763 --> 08:23.894
What do you mean,
you missed it?

08:23.938 --> 08:25.287
All I heard was the buzzing.

08:25.330 --> 08:27.463
I didn't hear
anything like that.

08:28.638 --> 08:30.684
Can you just tell me
what you saw?

08:30.727 --> 08:33.295
Okay, so I was walking
down the street on my way
home from school,

08:33.338 --> 08:36.254
and all of a sudden,
I look up and there's
this light in the sky.

08:36.298 --> 08:38.866
So I run out of my store
to see where this light
was coming from.

08:38.909 --> 08:41.564
- I look up and I see--
- Superman.

08:41.608 --> 08:44.741
This guy was legit.
He had a cape and everything.

08:44.785 --> 08:46.526
He was fighting someone
from, like, the movies.

08:46.569 --> 08:49.006
The bad guy? He was blue.
Like, literally, blue.

08:49.050 --> 08:51.574
Blue guy throws Superman
onto a car, wham!

08:51.618 --> 08:54.534
And then they just
keep fighting until, pow, pow.

08:54.577 --> 08:55.970
Superman knocks him out cold.

08:56.013 --> 08:58.538
So Superman grabs him
and then flies off.

08:58.581 --> 09:00.191
And then it's over.

09:00.235 --> 09:01.976
People are doing
the most these days
for likes and clicks.

09:02.019 --> 09:05.588
True, true.
But best stunt ever.

09:05.632 --> 09:08.939
Best stunt ever.

09:11.463 --> 09:13.596
<i>Was it a projection?</i> <i>
Was it wires?</i>

09:13.640 --> 09:16.468
Lourdes, I have nothing
to post about what happened
in my own town.

09:16.512 --> 09:17.992
I'm sorry.
I wish I could help,

09:18.035 --> 09:19.950
but I have no idea
who did this.

09:19.994 --> 09:23.780
You're the only other person
in town who hardcore knows
the comics world.

09:23.824 --> 09:26.653
No way something like this
happens without you
knowing about it.

09:26.696 --> 09:30.657
I'm flattered, but I was going
to say the same thing to you.

09:30.700 --> 09:31.658
What do you mean?

09:31.701 --> 09:32.963
You always know
what's going on,

09:33.007 --> 09:35.009
especially if
it's about Superman.

09:35.052 --> 09:37.751
I figured you had something
to do with it or knew who did.

09:37.794 --> 09:40.623
Kind of a sore subject.

09:44.409 --> 09:46.803
I got to go.

09:46.847 --> 09:48.152
Text me if you hear anything?

09:48.196 --> 09:49.197
Yeah.

09:51.025 --> 09:52.200
Or even if you don't.

09:57.335 --> 09:58.685
Oh.

10:00.512 --> 10:02.558
You're sure
it wasn't the military?

10:02.602 --> 10:06.214
Like an exercise or a flight
experiment or something?

10:06.257 --> 10:07.432
No, I'm positive.

10:07.476 --> 10:08.825
But with the dignitaries
arriving tomorrow,

10:08.869 --> 10:10.653
and the presentation
the day after that,

10:10.697 --> 10:12.350
it's all hands
on deck to prepare.

10:12.394 --> 10:14.396
No one at the base
planned this.

10:14.439 --> 10:16.877
Temp's normal. No fever.

10:16.920 --> 10:20.228
Sure you're okay, kid?
You've never been one
to just faint.

10:20.271 --> 10:21.403
I'm fine.

10:21.446 --> 10:24.667
It was just... so weird.

10:24.711 --> 10:26.930
Dinner is served, ladies.

10:29.846 --> 10:31.892
Hey, you know the rules.

10:31.935 --> 10:33.415
Time to put it away.

10:33.458 --> 10:36.287
Lourdes keeps texting me
about the Superman thing.

10:36.331 --> 10:37.506
Wait, Lourdes?

10:38.289 --> 10:39.813
Wait. Which one is she again?

10:39.856 --> 10:41.641
Purple hair.
She has a crush on Naomi.

10:42.337 --> 10:43.338
Mom.

10:45.296 --> 10:47.385
Does that mean no more Nathan?

10:47.429 --> 10:48.691
They broke up
last month.

10:48.735 --> 10:50.171
I thought you were
dating Anthony.

10:50.214 --> 10:53.783
Can we please
not talk about this?

10:53.827 --> 10:55.785
You're dating
multiple people now.

10:55.829 --> 10:58.570
They're all my friends.
I like them for
different reasons.

10:58.614 --> 11:02.139
You know, eventually,
you're gonna have to choose.

11:02.183 --> 11:04.620
I'm 16. You really want me
to settle down?

11:04.664 --> 11:05.926
I'm your father.

11:05.969 --> 11:07.101
I want you to live
in that bedroom

11:07.144 --> 11:08.711
with your stuffed animals
until you're 80.

11:10.060 --> 11:12.715
It's not about
who you're dating.

11:12.759 --> 11:14.195
It's about making a choice.

11:17.851 --> 11:21.811
Is this turning into a talk?
Feels like this is turning
into a talk.

11:21.855 --> 11:25.597
No, no, we want you
to be happy.

12:14.037 --> 12:15.299
What the hell?

12:15.865 --> 12:17.040
The camera's broken.

12:30.837 --> 12:31.751
Hello?

12:50.421 --> 12:54.208
They broke my camera,
right there.

12:54.251 --> 12:56.514
<i>What's up,</i> <i>
fellow Superman stans?</i>

12:56.558 --> 13:00.388

13:15.359 --> 13:18.754

13:24.368 --> 13:26.501

13:37.729 --> 13:40.645

exactly who pulled this stunt,</i>

13:40.689 --> 13:42.647
<i>why they did it,</i> <i>
and how they did it.</i>

13:43.823 --> 13:45.259

<i>and I'm going to get</i> <i>

13:46.913 --> 13:49.829
<i>and figure everything out.</i> <i>

13:49.872 --> 13:52.875
Babe, I say this with
all the love of my heart.

13:52.919 --> 13:54.485
You gotta get a grip.

13:54.529 --> 13:57.793
- I've never seen you like this.
- I need those videos, Anna.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.404
This Superman thing
is getting weirder by the day.

14:00.448 --> 14:03.712
The security cameras
on Main Street
are all disabled.

14:03.755 --> 14:06.671
Like cut wires,
blatant tampering.

14:07.977 --> 14:10.588
There's something
bigger going on here.

14:10.632 --> 14:12.895
Like what?

14:12.939 --> 14:14.331
That's what I want to find out.

14:14.375 --> 14:16.464
Babe, I know
you care about your site.

14:16.507 --> 14:18.074
That's not
what this is about.

14:18.118 --> 14:19.423
What do you mean?

14:19.467 --> 14:23.688
I remember when my dad
bought me my first comic.

14:23.732 --> 14:28.171
We were living in Japan.
I was having trouble
making friends.

14:28.215 --> 14:31.653
Those comics have always
made me happy and free.

14:31.696 --> 14:34.438
But ever since the stunt
in the Square, I feel off.

14:34.482 --> 14:36.745
Off how?

14:36.788 --> 14:39.966
This whole thing,
it has me feeling...

14:41.054 --> 14:42.577
I don't know...

14:42.620 --> 14:46.015
Strange. Not bad,
just different.

14:46.059 --> 14:48.278
I don't even
recognize the feeling.

14:48.322 --> 14:50.106
I have to figure out
what's happening.

14:53.240 --> 14:55.851
It's almost ready.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.114
Yeah, the sound just needs
a minute to sync.

14:59.681 --> 15:01.030
Thanks for this.

15:01.074 --> 15:02.292
I have all these
pieces of video,

15:02.336 --> 15:04.904
but none of them
makes sense on their own.

15:06.688 --> 15:07.732
Anything for you.

15:09.473 --> 15:13.521
Even though you, uh, dumped me.

15:17.177 --> 15:18.918
It doesn't change
the way I feel about you.

15:20.093 --> 15:22.747
And how do you feel about me?

15:27.100 --> 15:31.408
I feel a lot of things.
But mostly...

15:33.106 --> 15:35.369
I feel like
you're a good person,

15:35.412 --> 15:36.979
with a beautiful heart,

15:38.372 --> 15:40.156
which makes the whole
thing with Anthony

15:40.200 --> 15:42.680
and the party invite
gone wrong
really weird to me.

15:42.724 --> 15:45.596
I...

15:45.640 --> 15:48.991
- It totally was an accident.
- He's a townie.

15:49.035 --> 15:50.732
You don't like him.

15:50.775 --> 15:52.690
No, I don't.

16:00.046 --> 16:02.091
Maybe because you do.

16:13.711 --> 16:17.498
- Is it ready?
Ready.

16:45.395 --> 16:46.657
Oh, my God!

16:55.884 --> 16:57.103
Wow.

16:57.146 --> 16:59.888
I knew it was cool,
but seeing it like that?

17:01.107 --> 17:02.717
It looks so real.

17:04.066 --> 17:05.154
How'd they do it?

17:05.198 --> 17:07.678
Who's they and how
did they do what?

17:07.722 --> 17:09.680
We don't even know
what we're looking at.

17:10.507 --> 17:12.640
Well, let's look again.

17:12.683 --> 17:13.684
Slower this time.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.214
Hang on. Pause it.

17:22.998 --> 17:25.609
Is that Dee
from the tattoo shop?

17:31.224 --> 17:33.574
- What the hell?

17:38.492 --> 17:40.929
It looks like
they know each other.

17:44.585 --> 17:47.153
It feels weird that Dee
would be involved in this.

17:48.893 --> 17:51.113
Sometimes people aren't
who you think they are.

17:57.032 --> 17:58.033
Come on.

18:01.210 --> 18:03.125
Not a Zumbado fan?

18:03.169 --> 18:05.171
He's a bad person.

18:05.214 --> 18:09.175
You've seen what happens
when businesses like that
pop up around military bases.

18:09.218 --> 18:12.308
They take advantage
of folks who are just
trying to do their best.

18:12.352 --> 18:16.138
You do have to be
a special kind of awful
to rip off service members.

18:19.141 --> 18:21.143
...don't know how
or what was happening.

18:33.155 --> 18:38.029
- Naomi.
- Dee, uh, hi.

18:43.209 --> 18:45.428
Hey, you wear glasses.

18:47.082 --> 18:49.258
Um, yeah.

18:51.260 --> 18:53.262
I like your designs.

18:53.306 --> 18:55.264
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

18:55.308 --> 18:57.397
Art has been a valuable tool

18:57.440 --> 19:01.705
on my journey to live
a more centered
and, uh, intentional life.

19:03.403 --> 19:06.710
Right. So, um...

19:06.754 --> 19:11.280
Dee, you and I haven't
talked much or ever,

19:11.324 --> 19:13.369
and you're probably
wondering why I'm here.

19:13.413 --> 19:16.503
Uh, I'm guessing
it's not for a tattoo.

19:16.546 --> 19:19.332
Maybe when I turn 18.

19:19.375 --> 19:22.204
Okay, deal.

19:22.248 --> 19:24.859
March 14th, right?

19:26.426 --> 19:29.603
That's the day I was adopted.

19:29.646 --> 19:33.476
- How do you know that?
- Social media.

19:36.218 --> 19:37.915
What can I do for you, Naomi?

19:37.959 --> 19:41.049
We're trying to find out
who's behind the whole
Superman thing.

19:42.268 --> 19:43.791
In the video we saw,

19:43.834 --> 19:46.185
it looked like you knew
the guy who was playing him.

19:46.881 --> 19:49.100
I don't.

19:49.144 --> 19:53.104
You didn't
seem very surprised.

19:53.148 --> 19:55.281
I was. I was very surprised.

19:58.197 --> 20:02.244
No disrespect,
but it feels like you're
leaving something out.

20:02.288 --> 20:04.203
Oh, I'm... I'm not lying.

20:05.595 --> 20:08.032
Naomi, I think
maybe we should go.

20:08.076 --> 20:09.773
Yeah, I think you should.

20:09.817 --> 20:12.602
I'm sorry.
This is just not good
for my anxiety.

20:12.646 --> 20:15.475
Please, can you
just give us some answers?

20:15.518 --> 20:20.044
I can't give you answers
when you're not asking
the right questions.

20:20.088 --> 20:21.785
What does that mean?

20:27.443 --> 20:32.100
Um... it was me, okay?

20:32.143 --> 20:36.409
I did it. I planned
the fight on Main Street.

20:36.452 --> 20:38.846
You planned it?

20:41.762 --> 20:42.850
Why?

20:42.893 --> 20:44.982
For publicity.

20:45.026 --> 20:47.855
Business has been slow,
and I thought it would help.

20:47.898 --> 20:51.032
So I hired an actor
with a jet pack.

20:51.075 --> 20:53.991
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I really should be getting
back to work.

20:59.432 --> 21:01.129
<i>What's up, guys?</i>

21:01.172 --> 21:03.436
<i>I've been reading</i> <i>
your comments,</i> <i>
and it's true.</i>

21:03.479 --> 21:06.308
<i>Dee confessed to</i> <i>
the whole Superman stunt.</i>

21:06.352 --> 21:08.310
<i>He said that</i> <i>
it was for publicity,</i>

21:08.354 --> 21:11.313
<i>and that he hired</i> <i>
a guy with a jet pack.</i>

21:11.357 --> 21:13.707
<i>I didn't see that coming.</i>

21:13.750 --> 21:15.839
<i>I know it's not the answer</i> <i>
we were expecting.</i>

21:15.883 --> 21:20.627
<i>No one had "guy</i> <i>
from the tattoo shop"</i> <i>
on their list of suspects.</i>

21:20.670 --> 21:24.283
<i>I guess, sometimes,</i> <i>
people aren't who</i> <i>
you think they are.</i>

21:25.458 --> 21:26.937
Being chosen
to debate

21:26.981 --> 21:28.374
in front of the dignitaries
is a big deal.

21:28.417 --> 21:30.767
So we got you
something to celebrate.

21:32.465 --> 21:34.118
Surprise.

21:35.206 --> 21:36.512
I don't get it.

21:36.556 --> 21:39.863
That's your set.
- You're letting me drive?

21:39.907 --> 21:43.737
Naomi, you are a great student,
a great kid.

21:43.780 --> 21:45.565
We're really proud of you.

21:50.613 --> 21:53.137
I got to say,

21:53.181 --> 21:55.183
we thought there'd be
a lot more screaming

21:55.226 --> 21:57.620
and jumping
and general excitement.

21:57.664 --> 22:00.971
I am excited, really.
It's just...

22:04.584 --> 22:07.804
Do you guys know Dee?
The guy who owns
the tattoo parlor?

22:07.848 --> 22:09.458
Are you guys friends with him?

22:09.502 --> 22:11.504
'Cause he acted
like he knew me.

22:11.547 --> 22:14.202
He knew my adoption day.
No one knows that.

22:14.245 --> 22:15.856
And he seemed surprised
that I wore glasses.

22:15.899 --> 22:17.510
And why do I wear glasses?

22:17.553 --> 22:19.860
Sometimes it seems like
they make my vision worse.

22:19.903 --> 22:21.383
Honey, just take a deep breath.

22:21.427 --> 22:23.603
You know
why you wear glasses.

22:23.646 --> 22:26.780
You have a condition
called Leber optic neuropathy.
It's degenerative.

22:26.823 --> 22:29.348
The glasses help slow
the damage to your eyes.

22:31.785 --> 22:35.266
Okay, but what about Dee?

22:36.529 --> 22:38.574
Do you guys think
he knew my birth parents,

22:38.618 --> 22:43.057
and that's how he knows
when I was adopted
or something?

22:43.100 --> 22:46.669
Pumpkin, they died
in that crash far,
far away from here.

22:47.409 --> 22:48.584
You know that.

22:48.628 --> 22:51.152
I don't see how Dee
could have known them.

22:51.195 --> 22:54.068
This is a small town.
People talk.

22:57.593 --> 23:01.684
Okay, yeah. Sorry.

23:01.728 --> 23:05.035
Never be sorry for needing
to talk things through.

23:05.079 --> 23:09.388
- Okay? We're here.
- Always.

23:09.431 --> 23:12.608
Now, how would you like to have
your first practice session

23:12.652 --> 23:15.132
and drive your folks
to the base?

23:15.176 --> 23:18.309
- You ready?
- The question is,
"Are <i>you</i> ready?"

23:18.353 --> 23:20.355
'Cause you've never seen
driving like this before.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.226
How about
just regular driving?

23:22.270 --> 23:24.490
We should discuss
my soundtrack.

23:35.805 --> 23:37.546
"Is our behavior

23:37.590 --> 23:40.941
controlled only by our genes?"

23:40.984 --> 23:43.509
Miss Brooks,
the floor is yours.

23:43.552 --> 23:45.511
Thank you, Mr. Villarreal.

23:45.554 --> 23:47.774
We all know that both
nature and nurture

23:47.817 --> 23:49.950
play a factor
in our development,

23:49.993 --> 23:52.039
but which matters more?

23:52.082 --> 23:54.215
Many philosophers,
including Plato himself,

23:54.258 --> 23:56.870
argued that genetics
play a much bigger role.

23:56.913 --> 23:59.873
That is what I intend
to demonstrate today.

24:02.528 --> 24:03.790
Miss McDuffie?

24:03.833 --> 24:07.576
The floor is yours.

24:07.620 --> 24:14.496
There's a reason why people
have been debating about this
for such a long time.

24:14.540 --> 24:16.716
It's because
there's no easy answer,

24:17.891 --> 24:19.936
which is a hard thing
to accept.

24:22.722 --> 24:26.508
If genetics
are everything, yes,

24:26.552 --> 24:30.425
that does give us an answer.

24:30.469 --> 24:33.254
But maybe it keeps us
from having to do
the hardest thing of all...

24:35.778 --> 24:38.215
decide who it is we want to be,

24:39.173 --> 24:40.914
and understand...

24:40.957 --> 24:44.526
that what made you feel happy

24:44.570 --> 24:47.877
and free in one point
of your life may change,

24:49.749 --> 24:51.272
and that's okay.

24:52.969 --> 24:56.973
We have to be willing
to keep striving,

24:57.017 --> 24:59.280
keep searching
and asking questions,

25:00.629 --> 25:03.023
even when it's hard,

25:03.066 --> 25:05.242
even when we're afraid
of the answers.

25:07.810 --> 25:10.509
Even when the answers
don't make sense.

25:13.773 --> 25:18.473
In the end,
all we can control
is our choices,

25:18.517 --> 25:22.521
and it's our choices
that determine our destiny.

25:32.705 --> 25:36.665
Many argue
that all of our behaviors
and characteristics

25:36.709 --> 25:38.928
are a result of evolution.

25:42.236 --> 25:43.803
What would you say
to those people?

25:47.110 --> 25:49.678
First of all,
I would say that...

25:50.984 --> 25:52.942
First of all, I would say
to those people...

25:58.861 --> 26:01.951
Um, I would tell them that...

26:03.649 --> 26:06.565
What I would tell them is...

26:06.608 --> 26:07.827
Shall I repeat the question?

26:07.870 --> 26:10.569
No, I... I heard you.
I can't...

26:11.700 --> 26:13.093
I need a moment, please.

26:21.754 --> 26:23.190
Naomi!

26:25.845 --> 26:28.848
Dr. Riley said
he can't be sure
without running tests,

26:28.891 --> 26:31.807
- but he thinks
it was a panic attack.
Oh, okay.

26:31.851 --> 26:33.896
That is way better
than what the Internet said.

26:33.940 --> 26:36.464
By the way, very bad idea
to check symptoms online.

26:37.683 --> 26:39.249
We have
an appointment tomorrow.

26:41.861 --> 26:43.689
But what if
it's something else?

26:43.732 --> 26:45.038
Like what?

26:46.648 --> 26:47.910
I don't know.

26:47.954 --> 26:51.218
This all started the day
of the Superman thing.

26:51.261 --> 26:55.875
Maybe it's somehow connected,
like the same trick or device.

26:55.918 --> 26:59.879
Yeah, but pumpkin, why would
it happen again here,
on the base?

27:01.054 --> 27:02.838
Greg,
it's the doctor.

27:06.886 --> 27:08.757
Good. They're gone.

27:08.801 --> 27:10.933
Now we can talk about
what's really important.

27:11.891 --> 27:13.849
You drive now?

27:13.893 --> 27:15.808
Can you believe that?

27:15.851 --> 27:18.114
I literally cannot.
I thought Jen and Greg
would never cave.

27:18.158 --> 27:20.421
- I know.
I mean, now
we just have to get a car.

27:20.464 --> 27:22.641
Obviously, you can't buy it
because you don't have a job,

27:22.684 --> 27:26.514
and obviously, I can't
buy it because I also
don't have a job.

27:26.557 --> 27:28.603
But let's face it,
I don't want to drive.

27:28.647 --> 27:29.822
I want to be driven.

27:29.865 --> 27:31.737
I was thinking that...

27:46.665 --> 27:48.144
I can see that.

27:48.188 --> 27:53.106
"Superman landing,
Red River Forest."

28:42.851 --> 28:44.113
What...

28:48.074 --> 28:50.685
Okay, before you say anything,

28:50.729 --> 28:53.122
I know I said I was
coming to your house,
but I'm in the woods.

28:53.166 --> 28:54.776
<i>Naomi,</i> <i>
what are you... Woods?</i>

28:54.820 --> 28:56.299
- Annabelle? <i>
- Naomi...</i>

28:56.343 --> 28:58.301
- Anna, I can't hear you.

28:58.345 --> 29:00.564
- Anna, are you there? <i>
- Naomi...</i>

29:00.608 --> 29:04.133
- Hello?
Not that much service
out here, is there?

29:04.177 --> 29:06.701
Zumbado.

29:07.571 --> 29:09.051
What are you doing here?

29:09.095 --> 29:12.489
It's a beautiful day.
I'm hiking.

29:13.969 --> 29:15.362
What are you doing out here?

29:15.405 --> 29:20.454
I was, um--
- You were taking pictures.

29:20.497 --> 29:23.196
I'm guessing for that
Superman website of yours?

29:23.239 --> 29:24.719
How do you know about my site?

29:27.722 --> 29:29.637
You know what
I find interesting, Naomi?

29:31.291 --> 29:33.946
Out of all the comic book
characters in the world,

29:33.989 --> 29:35.774
you chose Superman.

29:37.732 --> 29:39.516
Why is that?

29:39.560 --> 29:43.694
I mean, clearly you feel
some type of connection
to that character.

29:43.738 --> 29:45.696
We're both adopted.

29:48.047 --> 29:50.440
You're either clueless,
full of yourself,

29:50.484 --> 29:52.486
or you're just not ready
to face the truth.

29:54.880 --> 29:55.968
Probably all three.

30:00.233 --> 30:01.451
I'm gonna need that disk.

30:01.495 --> 30:04.411
- What?
- Don't play dumb, Naomi.

30:04.454 --> 30:06.021
I know you've been
looking for it.

30:06.065 --> 30:07.849
First on Main Street,
and now here.

30:07.893 --> 30:10.112
I don't even know what it is.

30:13.899 --> 30:17.163
Wait. How did you know
that I was on Main Street?

30:21.036 --> 30:24.300
You... You were following me.

30:25.954 --> 30:27.347
Did you disable
the cameras too?

30:29.349 --> 30:30.654
The disk.

30:46.932 --> 30:48.455
Stay back!

31:01.947 --> 31:05.124
Can be hard once you realize
you're not like everyone else.

31:06.647 --> 31:07.866
It was for me.

31:09.519 --> 31:11.739
People start to look
at you differently.

31:17.136 --> 31:20.879
But the trick is learning
to control your powers.

31:22.184 --> 31:24.186
I used to be ashamed
of who I was.

31:25.796 --> 31:27.886
Thought something was wrong
with me, but there's not.

31:31.106 --> 31:33.630
World's full of sheep.
I was meant for more.

31:37.112 --> 31:38.766
I finally realized...

31:55.043 --> 31:57.480
Why be a sheep
when you can be a wolf?

31:58.873 --> 32:00.396
Stay back!

32:13.453 --> 32:15.672
What was that? What did you do?

32:15.716 --> 32:18.980
You think
that I did that?

32:30.513 --> 32:32.863
Don't believe everything
that you think, Naomi.

32:36.955 --> 32:37.956
It's dangerous.

32:50.969 --> 32:53.972
Okay, okay.

32:54.015 --> 32:57.323
So instead of coming
over to my house,
you went into the woods,

32:57.366 --> 32:59.107
alone, by the way,

32:59.151 --> 33:01.153
which we are definitely going
to be talking about later.

33:01.196 --> 33:04.243
And then, in the woods,
you had what sounds like

33:04.286 --> 33:06.114
a truly terrifying encounter,

33:06.158 --> 33:08.943
which included the trees
coming alive in a real
horror movie kind of way,

33:08.987 --> 33:11.598
which makes you think
that Zumbado is the one
behind the stunt

33:11.641 --> 33:14.035
and all this weirdness
and not Dee,

33:14.079 --> 33:15.776
even though Dee confessed.

33:15.819 --> 33:16.820
Did I miss anything?

33:18.126 --> 33:20.476
- No.
- Okay.

33:21.042 --> 33:22.261
Okay?

33:22.304 --> 33:24.263
- You believe me?
- Of course I believe you.

33:24.306 --> 33:26.047
I know how crazy it all sounds.

33:26.091 --> 33:27.309
You're not crazy, babe.

33:27.353 --> 33:30.530
Look, when you've eliminated
the impossible,

33:30.573 --> 33:33.968
whatever remains,
however improbable,
must be the truth.

33:35.187 --> 33:37.102
I've been bingeing <i>Sherlock.</i>

33:37.145 --> 33:39.234
Look, I don't understand
how Zumbado is involved
in all this.

33:39.278 --> 33:40.757
I mean, the guy
sells crappy cars.

33:40.801 --> 33:44.065
I don't know, but he really
wanted that disk.

33:46.459 --> 33:48.243
It must
be valuable.

33:48.287 --> 33:50.898
Okay, well,
what are we going to do?

33:50.941 --> 33:53.857
It's not like we can
walk into Zumbado's shop
and just look for it.

33:56.730 --> 33:59.298
Oh, no.
That's your plan,
isn't it?

33:59.341 --> 34:01.691
We'll be in and out.
He'll never know
that we were there.

34:01.735 --> 34:04.303
Naomi, breaking and entering,
that's, like, serious stuff.

34:04.346 --> 34:08.916
Not breaking and entering.
More like...

34:08.959 --> 34:11.136
inviting-ourselves-
in-through-the-window-

34:11.179 --> 34:14.313
while-Zumbado's-not-there
and entering.

34:14.356 --> 34:16.358
We won't break anything.

34:16.402 --> 34:19.057
Fine, but we're
gonna need help.

34:24.497 --> 34:26.629
I feel
like we're in a movie.

34:26.673 --> 34:30.242
Can we have code names?
I call Elrond.

34:30.285 --> 34:31.286
From <i>Lord of the Rings.</i>

34:31.330 --> 34:32.331
Sorry I'm late.

34:34.159 --> 34:36.335
What's he doing here?

34:36.378 --> 34:39.033
- Awkward.
- Did you bring them?

34:43.733 --> 34:44.560
Ponies.

34:44.604 --> 34:45.953
- Cute.
Ha-ha.

34:45.996 --> 34:47.955
It's my sister's.
It's all I could find.

34:47.998 --> 34:50.392
Okay, here's the plan.

34:50.436 --> 34:53.003
Two people will stay outside
and be lookouts.

34:53.047 --> 34:55.310
Elrond to Aragorn,

34:55.354 --> 34:57.225
we're good to go
for the Precious.

34:57.269 --> 34:59.401
Dude, no one knows that means.

35:00.228 --> 35:01.838
Philistines.

35:01.882 --> 35:03.710
<i>The rest of us</i> <i>
will jump the fence...</i>

35:11.196 --> 35:12.197
<i>then sneak inside.</i>

35:15.461 --> 35:17.724
- Annabelle?

35:17.767 --> 35:20.030
- How does it look? <i>
- All clear.</i>

35:20.074 --> 35:22.990
I think. I've never
actually done this before.

36:47.248 --> 36:48.423
What the hell?

36:55.387 --> 36:58.520
March 14th, 2004.

37:02.698 --> 37:06.354
Is that Dee?
He looks exactly the same.

37:06.398 --> 37:10.445
- The mysterious--
Naomi,
I think we found something.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.412
Maybe he keeps cash in there?

37:20.455 --> 37:22.370
What I need
is in that safe.

37:23.589 --> 37:24.894
We have to open it.

37:29.464 --> 37:30.987
Zumbado's coming.

37:31.031 --> 37:33.076
You need to get out
of there now.

37:53.358 --> 37:54.402
Let's go, come on.

38:01.888 --> 38:04.412
Come on.
Let's split up.

38:04.456 --> 38:06.022
Yeah.

38:19.775 --> 38:22.169
You told me I wasn't asking
the right questions.

38:25.346 --> 38:26.652
What did you mean by that?

38:28.349 --> 38:29.698
I shouldn't have said that.

38:36.836 --> 38:40.143
The Superman thing
wasn't you, was it?

38:41.884 --> 38:42.885
No.

38:51.024 --> 38:52.373
Why did you lie?

38:52.417 --> 38:53.766
You were upset.

38:55.158 --> 38:57.639
I'm... I'm not comfortable
with confrontation.

39:00.773 --> 39:02.949
Then how about a conversation?

39:05.560 --> 39:07.214
Please talk to me.

39:07.257 --> 39:08.607
I need answers.

39:12.480 --> 39:14.047
I'm not the guy who's got them.

39:15.265 --> 39:16.484
I'm nobody.

39:27.452 --> 39:28.888
But I'll try.

39:33.675 --> 39:35.677
This happened here before,

39:36.635 --> 39:38.419
on the day I was adopted.

39:39.681 --> 39:41.074
You were there.

39:41.727 --> 39:45.252
Yes, I was there.

39:45.295 --> 39:51.214
Something happened to me
during the Superman thing,

39:52.999 --> 39:55.175
and then again
at the military base.

39:55.828 --> 39:57.960
I heard all this buzzing.

39:58.004 --> 39:59.701
And then I went to the woods

39:59.745 --> 40:01.442
and found some kind of disk,

40:01.486 --> 40:04.402
- with all this weird
writing on it--
- Wait.

40:05.751 --> 40:07.840
Go back to the buzzing.

40:07.883 --> 40:10.625
I've never heard
or felt anything like it.

40:10.669 --> 40:13.628
It made me dizzy and weak.

40:13.672 --> 40:15.674
No one else
seemed to be affected.

40:16.675 --> 40:18.328
Do you know what it was?

40:20.896 --> 40:21.854
No.

40:23.508 --> 40:26.424
But it may have something to do

40:27.337 --> 40:29.383
with people like us.

40:32.734 --> 40:35.171
People like us.
What are you talking about?

40:37.522 --> 40:40.220
You know, it wasn't
supposed to happen like this.

40:42.483 --> 40:43.876
It wasn't time yet.

40:48.010 --> 40:52.580
But I guess
things have changed.

40:54.713 --> 40:56.105
Time for what?

40:59.065 --> 41:00.196
The truth.

41:08.640 --> 41:11.469
Who are you?

41:11.512 --> 41:13.471
Still the wrong question.

41:18.780 --> 41:21.217
Dee, what's happening?

41:33.578 --> 41:34.709
What is the question?

41:40.759 --> 41:44.545
What is the question, Naomi?

41:47.417 --> 41:48.810
The question is...

41:52.597 --> 41:53.772
Who am I?
