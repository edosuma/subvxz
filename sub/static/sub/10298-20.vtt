01:18.901 --> 01:20.901
Bud, what do
you think?

01:20.901 --> 01:22.968
Will this look good
for my graduation
picture?

01:25.334 --> 01:27.100
I don't know, Kel.

01:27.100 --> 01:29.267
If you really
want people to
remember you,

01:29.267 --> 01:30.501
you might want to
try this.

01:34.300 --> 01:36.801
Now...we'll just add
a few fingerprints,

01:36.801 --> 01:37.801
<i>and voilà.</i>

01:39.801 --> 01:41.133
Every man's memory.

01:42.767 --> 01:43.801
Mom...

01:43.801 --> 01:44.901
I want to look
really good

01:44.901 --> 01:46.234
for my graduation
pictures.

01:46.234 --> 01:47.234
Can I get a tattoo?

01:48.801 --> 01:53.367
Kelly...honey, we had this
tattoo talk when you were 8.

01:53.367 --> 01:54.868
No tattoos
above the waist

01:54.868 --> 01:57.968
for any member
of this family,
young lady.

01:57.968 --> 02:00.200
Can't we learn
from Grandma's
mistakes?

02:01.400 --> 02:03.434
Stuck at her age with
"love" and "hate"

02:03.434 --> 02:04.868
tattooed
on her breasts.

02:06.934 --> 02:08.800
I mean, don't you think
she feels silly now

02:08.800 --> 02:11.234
with those verbs
bouncing against
her knees?

02:14.067 --> 02:16.067
I'm sorry.
I forgot.

02:16.067 --> 02:17.367
How about
a nose ring?

02:17.367 --> 02:19.934
Oh. Honey,
let me show you

02:19.934 --> 02:22.167
what a yearbook picture
should look like.

02:26.701 --> 02:28.901
Now look what
you've done.

02:28.901 --> 02:31.767
We have to look through
the old folks' book again.

02:33.501 --> 02:36.667
The worst part
is when she sighs
when she opens it.

02:36.667 --> 02:38.267
[SIGHS]

02:39.667 --> 02:42.400
Oh, Bonnie Malone.

02:42.400 --> 02:44.167
Now, here is
a perfect example

02:44.167 --> 02:46.667
of what not to do
in a high school
yearbook.

02:46.667 --> 02:50.167
Huh. Pose with your baby.
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

02:53.367 --> 02:54.801
Who's
the hunk?

02:54.801 --> 02:56.634
That's your father.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.067
What's that
on his face?

03:02.067 --> 03:03.267
A smile.

03:06.734 --> 03:07.767
Wow.     Wow.

03:09.367 --> 03:10.834
Daddy had hair.

03:12.200 --> 03:14.200
And look:
shoulders.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.334
Up here.

03:16.734 --> 03:18.100
Let's see
your picture,
Mom.

03:18.100 --> 03:19.133
Oh, okay.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.067
Oh...

03:22.067 --> 03:23.067
Ohh, mom.
Oh, you were

03:23.067 --> 03:25.701
so pretty, Mom.

03:25.701 --> 03:27.567
Wow.
What happened?

03:30.501 --> 03:32.501
It's been
60 years, Kel.

03:34.667 --> 03:36.968
Oh, look at this.

03:36.968 --> 03:40.501
My high school diploma.
Still sealed.

03:40.501 --> 03:43.868
Boy, I must have just stuck it
in here and forgot all about it.

03:43.868 --> 03:46.000
Now, Kelly...I want you
to look at this.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.300
Because one day you'll have
a beautiful diploma

03:48.300 --> 03:50.367
just like this, that reads...

03:52.367 --> 03:54.000
"Report
for summer school.

03:57.868 --> 04:00.734
"You must complete
1/2 credit more

04:00.734 --> 04:03.567
before you qualify
for a diploma."

04:09.300 --> 04:11.868
Family, the greatest
thing happened.

04:11.868 --> 04:16.233
The cash register at the store
closed out 20 cents over.

04:16.233 --> 04:18.868
Guess whose pocket
that went into?

04:22.033 --> 04:23.834
Quite a genetic
sandwich, eh, Kel?

04:23.834 --> 04:25.267
Mmm.

04:25.267 --> 04:27.801
Hey, the old
high school yearbook.

04:27.801 --> 04:30.834
Seems like just the other day
your mother and I graduated.

04:30.834 --> 04:31.834
[CHUCKLING]

04:31.834 --> 04:34.133
Shh!

04:34.133 --> 04:36.334
And soon my little
Pumpkin will graduate.

04:36.334 --> 04:38.133
And next year, Bud.

04:38.133 --> 04:40.267
Bud will go off
to college one day.

04:40.267 --> 04:42.801
You're gonna be
the smartest Bundy yet, son.

04:42.801 --> 04:46.133
So I guess I'll be
the second-smartest.

04:46.133 --> 04:48.934
Of course,
Peg will be third.

04:48.934 --> 04:51.000
Kelly...well...

04:51.000 --> 04:53.100
No. Uh-uh.
Not me.

04:53.100 --> 04:54.167
I'm third.

04:54.167 --> 04:55.834
It may take me
five or six years,

04:55.834 --> 04:57.901
but at least
I'm gonna graduate.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.100
What do you mean,
Kelly?

05:06.767 --> 05:08.234
AL:
Family TV hour,
Buck!

05:09.634 --> 05:11.801
Now, let's see
what's on TV.

05:11.801 --> 05:13.934
Hey, here's a good
show for you, Peg.

05:15.133 --> 05:16.133
<i>"Goober.</i>

05:19.033 --> 05:22.901

to town."

05:26.000 --> 05:28.067
Go ahead, Peg.
You try to
read the rest.

05:28.067 --> 05:30.234
[LAUGHING]

05:31.334 --> 05:32.334
How about
this one?

05:32.334 --> 05:34.267
How about
some math,
Mom?

05:34.267 --> 05:35.667
How many fingers
am I holding up?

05:35.667 --> 05:37.400
[LAUGHING]

05:37.400 --> 05:39.534
Yeah, yeah, mom.
Answer this one.

05:43.434 --> 05:44.901
Oh, well,
it doesn't
matter.

05:44.901 --> 05:47.667
At least, I'm not
the stupidest.

05:47.667 --> 05:48.767
Kids, come with me.

05:48.767 --> 05:51.033
I want to show you
something.

05:51.033 --> 05:52.834
It's the only one
of its kind
in the house.

05:54.767 --> 05:56.701
My high school
diploma.

05:56.701 --> 05:59.868
[IN UNISON]
Ooh.

05:59.868 --> 06:01.434
Kelly, pretty soon
you'll have one.

06:01.434 --> 06:03.000
Then, Bud,
you'll have one.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.267
And then, well,
that's all.

06:05.267 --> 06:06.601
[LAUGHING]

06:07.968 --> 06:10.033
Oh, wait a minute.
That's not fair.

06:10.033 --> 06:12.200
Buck graduated
obedience school.

06:12.200 --> 06:15.133
See. Here's
his diploma.

06:15.133 --> 06:16.133
So see, Peg,

06:16.133 --> 06:18.400
you're, kind of,
fifth-smartest.

06:18.400 --> 06:20.267
[LAUGHING]

06:20.267 --> 06:22.767
I am not dumber
than the dog.

06:22.767 --> 06:24.400
Oh, yeah?

06:24.400 --> 06:25.834
Well, let's just
see about that.

06:27.767 --> 06:29.767
Buck, get off
the couch.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.801
When was the last time
you did that, Peg?

06:33.801 --> 06:35.567
[LAUGHING]

06:35.567 --> 06:36.567
That was good,
Dad.

06:36.567 --> 06:38.734
That's a good one,
Dad.

06:38.734 --> 06:41.067
Okay, look kids,
I'm gonna go to the store

06:41.067 --> 06:42.133
and get some dinner.

06:42.133 --> 06:44.501
Hey, I know.
How about alphabet soup?

06:44.501 --> 06:47.300
That way you can eat
and learn.

06:48.601 --> 06:50.400
[LAUGHS]

06:52.167 --> 06:54.100
All right,
that does it.

06:54.100 --> 06:57.367
I'm gonna find out
just why I didn't graduate here.

06:57.367 --> 06:59.534
You know, Margie thinks
she's so cool

06:59.534 --> 07:01.834
because her mom has
a plate in her head.

07:01.834 --> 07:03.734
I cannot wait to see
her face when we tell her

07:03.734 --> 07:05.334
our mom's a dropout.
Yeah.

07:07.267 --> 07:10.801
Okay...I see the problem.

07:10.801 --> 07:12.100
It seems that I failed

07:12.100 --> 07:16.200
one stupid, useless class
my senior year.

07:16.200 --> 07:18.467
What did you fail,
Mom?

07:18.467 --> 07:20.067
Home Economics.

07:21.634 --> 07:23.968
Gee...what a shock.

07:26.167 --> 07:27.834
Are you gonna
make up the class, Mom?

07:27.834 --> 07:30.601
Are you kidding?
I can't spare the time.

07:30.601 --> 07:34.133
<i>The Battle ofThe Luckiest
Men Alive is on TV this week.</i>

07:34.133 --> 07:37.901
This week, Gavin MacLeod
squares off with Joe Piscopo.

07:40.968 --> 07:44.067
Peg, I want to introduce you
to someone who proves

07:44.067 --> 07:47.501
you don't need a high school
diploma to be important.

07:47.501 --> 07:48.501

07:51.868 --> 07:52.868
Change?

07:58.934 --> 08:01.100
All right,

be seated.

08:04.901 --> 08:07.801
Today we will review
for our final exam.

08:07.801 --> 08:11.367
But first, I would like to say
that it has been a delight

08:11.367 --> 08:14.334
to see you change
from innocent freshmen

08:14.334 --> 08:17.167
to the leaders of tomorrow.

08:17.167 --> 08:20.234
Will someone please
wake up Miss Bundy?

08:20.234 --> 08:22.868
The dog ate
my homework.

08:22.868 --> 08:26.801
Miss Bundy, why can't you
be more like Ruben?

08:30.267 --> 08:32.467
Well...we both
like boys.

08:37.234 --> 08:41.534
Class...today a new student
will be joining us.

08:41.534 --> 08:43.133
Because of her
life experience,

08:43.133 --> 08:45.067
she will only have
to take the final.

08:45.801 --> 08:48.467
No, it couldn't be.

all the schools

08:50.868 --> 08:52.067

into mine.

08:57.167 --> 08:59.767

for vandalizing

09:29.567 --> 09:30.868

09:32.534 --> 09:34.834
No, Susan, that
would be wrong.

09:37.601 --> 09:39.367
And now,
let's just bone up a bit

09:39.367 --> 09:42.300
before our final exam
assignments.

09:42.300 --> 09:46.067
How would one prepare...
cinnamon toast?

That was
magnificent.

10:00.334 --> 10:01.334
Thank you.

10:07.334 --> 10:08.467
Now is the time

10:08.467 --> 10:11.200
for each of you to take
one assignment card

10:11.200 --> 10:14.400
from my Home Ec
bag o' challenges.

10:15.701 --> 10:18.634

wake up Miss Bundy

10:18.634 --> 10:20.601
and Miss Wanker.

10:21.834 --> 10:23.534

my homework!

10:25.701 --> 10:28.334
Anyhow...written
on every card

10:28.334 --> 10:30.901
is the name of a dish that
you must prepare tonight

10:30.901 --> 10:33.901
and turn in for
your final grade tomorrow.

10:33.901 --> 10:38.868
And then later that day,
my cats and I will eat it all.

10:38.868 --> 10:41.734

get hot water
this time of night?

11:36.734 --> 11:38.734
Honey, I don't know.

11:38.734 --> 11:41.767
Just use cold. It comes
right out of the faucet.

11:43.200 --> 11:44.968

like the picture.

Yeah, neither
does mine. Look.

It was Born Before 1900 Day
at the shoe store.

12:41.367 --> 12:43.434
There were some feet
that were so wrinkled,

12:43.434 --> 12:45.534
you could've made
a third foot out of them.

I truly, truly
want to die.

alone in my bedroom,
in my nightgown.

13:08.634 --> 13:13.434
I had just put in
a videocassette and was
really ready to...

13:13.434 --> 13:14.701
do my taxes...

13:16.133 --> 13:17.901

an insect

my bedroom window.

an apology.

in this much trouble.

13:59.901 --> 14:03.334
Well, I guess I'll just go back
and try to get in the mood to...

14:03.334 --> 14:04.868
do my taxes.

as well face it.
