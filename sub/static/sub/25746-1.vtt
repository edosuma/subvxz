01:25.917 --> 01:30.042
Argentina adhered
to an international convention which,

01:30.542 --> 01:36.125
as you know, are agreements
between every country in the world

01:36.250 --> 01:37.875
that must be complied with.

01:38.292 --> 01:44.667
This particular convention
was about time zones.

01:46.458 --> 01:51.000
In 1923,

01:51.292 --> 01:57.083
the naval observatory,
which is the institution

01:57.167 --> 02:00.208
that would determine the official
time in Argentina, was created.

02:00.292 --> 02:01.458
On what grounds?

02:01.583 --> 02:05.792
It was done on the basis
of the prime meridian.

02:05.917 --> 02:09.000
The English were in on this, too.

02:09.125 --> 02:15.458
The earth was divided into sections,

02:15.667 --> 02:18.792
like an orange,

02:26.042 --> 02:27.417
Hi, Antonio...

02:28.042 --> 02:29.292
Yeah, it's Ely...

02:30.458 --> 02:33.000
I can't make it today...

02:34.458 --> 02:36.000
No, everything's fine...

02:36.792 --> 02:38.833
I have a stomach ache, that's all...

02:39.583 --> 02:40.833
All right.

03:32.792 --> 03:34.250
End of the line.

05:36.958 --> 05:38.917
Soy beans...

05:39.333 --> 05:41.542
Which of those beans...

05:41.708 --> 05:47.500
The expert says if between two...

05:49.292 --> 05:52.833
Which of those beans are soy beans?

05:52.958 --> 05:56.833
Maybe even fifty thousand pesos...

06:44.667 --> 06:48.875
Go downstairs
and change into your uniform this instant.

06:49.917 --> 06:53.375
The thing is I'm not...

06:53.583 --> 06:56.917
Helena no longer works here.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.458
Since when?

07:00.083 --> 07:01.208
Since now...

07:10.583 --> 07:13.667
You have to make a word,

07:13.833 --> 07:16.667
but there's something
we have to do first...

07:19.208 --> 07:24.958
I want you to take away all the letters
that the word does not contain...

08:14.833 --> 08:15.833
What's up?

08:19.458 --> 08:20.542
You OK?

08:22.458 --> 08:26.167
Have you guys put in the money
for the graduation sweatshirts?

08:26.292 --> 08:27.542
- No.
- No.

08:41.707 --> 08:47.708
VETERINARY SURGEON
CLINICAL CARE

08:48.000 --> 08:50.250
This is an allergic
reaction to the food.

08:50.333 --> 08:53.250
We're going to change it,
she needs an antibiotic.

08:53.333 --> 08:54.958
Could you give her
an injection yourself?

08:55.042 --> 08:56.625
If I have no choice...

08:56.708 --> 08:59.667
You could try in syrup form.
What's her weight?

08:59.875 --> 09:02.875
About 28 kilos...

09:08.917 --> 09:12.125
Some five centimeters...

09:12.292 --> 09:15.417
Ely, could you get me
a cefalexin, please?

09:16.875 --> 09:22.125
You should give it to her
three times a day. Every eight hours.

09:26.583 --> 09:30.250
Midnight, then eight in the morning,
something like that.

09:30.333 --> 09:36.917
So you put in the syringe
straight out of the jar.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.167
It's easier to give it to her
if she's sitting up.

10:02.208 --> 10:06.000
Dad, I'm out of here.
You're opening up in the morning, right?

10:06.167 --> 10:07.542
Yeah, no problem.

10:08.083 --> 10:10.542
- Bye.
- Bye. Get some rest.

10:14.125 --> 10:15.333
Bye!

10:19.042 --> 10:21.375
- Bye, Antonio.
- Bye, see you tomorrow.

10:21.458 --> 10:23.250
- Should I turn off the lights?
- Please.

13:00.917 --> 13:03.542
- Should we get going?
- Drop me off at the gas station.

13:03.667 --> 13:04.875
OK.

13:10.667 --> 13:17.125
A large number of Bolivian citizens
have decided to block traffic

13:17.292 --> 13:22.417
since Peruvians squatters have moved

13:22.583 --> 13:28.042
into the building
where they rent apartments.

13:28.167 --> 13:32.542
The police have raided to get them out.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.625
Could you tell us what's going on?

13:37.708 --> 13:40.250
The landlord is here at the moment,

13:40.333 --> 13:44.917
I want everyone to see
what they've done.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.208
What security force is protecting us,
the workers?

14:01.292 --> 14:06.125
"Edge" is an excellent idea,
and so is "challenge"...

14:09.167 --> 14:11.542
But neither is right...

14:21.458 --> 14:25.875
All that should be left
are the letters in the word...

14:33.000 --> 14:35.167
Can I take the "U" away?

14:35.292 --> 14:37.042
OK, gone.

14:37.667 --> 14:42.417
What about the "E"? Any other?

15:00.375 --> 15:02.417
Date of your last period...?

15:05.042 --> 15:06.625
How late are you?

15:07.708 --> 15:09.250
About three weeks.

15:11.333 --> 15:14.375
Do you get routine
pelvic examinations?

15:18.417 --> 15:21.792
You need to get an ultrasound
in about fifteen days

15:21.917 --> 15:25.458
to find out how far along you are
and make sure everything's OK.

15:26.333 --> 15:29.542
I'm also going to order
some blood tests, HIV included,

15:29.667 --> 15:33.792
and to confirm that you are,
in fact, pregnant.

15:37.042 --> 15:41.292
Make an appointment with an obstetrician
to get regular checkups.

15:45.417 --> 15:46.875
I'm not going to have it.

15:52.208 --> 15:55.542
What does the father say?
Does he know?

15:58.000 --> 15:59.875
Do your parents know?

15:59.958 --> 16:01.500
I'm not going to have it.

16:02.958 --> 16:05.542
You really should talk this over
with them.

16:07.292 --> 16:10.500
Think it over, talk to your family,
and then we'll see.

16:10.583 --> 16:12.833
I've already thought it over.
I'm not having it.

16:13.583 --> 16:18.417
You know that abortion is illegal
in Argentina,

16:18.625 --> 16:22.458
except in a few specific cases
and yours is not one of them.

16:23.208 --> 16:25.708
We can't support you in that decision.

16:29.042 --> 16:33.417
At this point, your only option
it is to put it up for adoption.

16:36.333 --> 16:41.667
What I can do is refer you
to a team of psychologists.

17:06.041 --> 17:07.833
MONITOR'S OFFICE

17:14.708 --> 17:16.000
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:16.166 --> 17:18.291
- Here's the doctor's note.
- Good.

17:18.791 --> 17:22.458
- Did you mark me absent?
- I was about to.

17:33.625 --> 17:38.125
I read, you read,

17:38.833 --> 17:42.375
he/she reads,

17:43.042 --> 17:45.250
we read,

17:46.083 --> 17:48.792
you read,

17:49.208 --> 17:51.750
they read.

17:54.833 --> 17:58.208
Lorena, read please.

18:07.333 --> 18:11.083
Very good, Lorena. Now you, Agustin.

18:18.208 --> 18:21.292
"In countries
where abortion is not legal or safe,

18:21.458 --> 18:25.625
you can get the
medication at pharmacies,

18:25.708 --> 18:29.125
sometimes even over the counter
without a prescription.

18:29.583 --> 18:33.833
It is often easier to get the medication

18:34.167 --> 18:38.958
at smaller pharmacies
than at large chains.

18:40.583 --> 18:43.875
To get them to give you the medication,
you can say

18:43.958 --> 18:46.958
that your grandmother
has severe arthritis,

18:47.042 --> 18:49.250
and she can't come herself.

18:49.417 --> 18:53.000
A male friend or your boyfriend
can go for you,

18:53.083 --> 18:56.667
since they may be more willing
to give a man the medication".

18:56.833 --> 18:59.583
Get a guy to do it.
They'll never sell it to you.

18:59.792 --> 19:02.625
"Sometimes
it's possible to buy the medication

19:02.708 --> 19:07.000
on the black market,
where you can get marijuana.

19:07.083 --> 19:10.917
Make sure it is
really the medication

19:11.000 --> 19:13.583
and not a counterfeit medication".

19:56.583 --> 19:58.417
I don't know... beer, wine...

19:58.875 --> 20:00.500
OK. How's Cata?

20:02.667 --> 20:04.208
Give her a kiss for me.

20:33.583 --> 20:34.667
Hello.

20:40.667 --> 20:42.042
- Hello.
- Hi...

20:42.167 --> 20:44.917
Sergio, can you help them, please?

20:55.958 --> 20:58.958
- Good afternoon.
- Hi... we want this.

21:01.958 --> 21:04.417
- Do you have a prescription?
- No.

21:04.542 --> 21:07.958
I can't sell you this medication
without a prescription.

21:08.042 --> 21:10.208
How much does it cost?

21:10.583 --> 21:13.333
No one is going to sell it to you
without a prescription.

21:14.458 --> 21:17.042
- Anything else, girls?
- No, thank you.

21:17.292 --> 21:18.250
See you later.

21:21.458 --> 21:22.667
Bye.

21:59.583 --> 22:00.542
Hello.

22:00.708 --> 22:03.542
Hi, we wanted to ask
about these pills...

22:03.708 --> 22:05.042
How much do they cost?

22:06.167 --> 22:07.500
Do you have a prescription?

22:07.583 --> 22:08.833
Not on me...

22:10.167 --> 22:12.000
These are expensive....

22:12.167 --> 22:14.125
I can't sell them
without a prescription.

22:14.292 --> 22:15.667
Nobody will, actually.

22:15.833 --> 22:18.375
- Are they for you?
- For my mom.

22:20.458 --> 22:24.000
If you give me a few days,
I can get other pills.

22:24.167 --> 22:29.333
Different brand, same medication,
cheaper and without prescription.

22:30.167 --> 22:31.875
Can your mom hold off?

22:31.958 --> 22:32.917
Yeah...

22:34.042 --> 22:36.000
Good. Give me your number...

22:36.667 --> 22:38.042
Give him yours.

22:39.292 --> 22:41.625
- 15...
- Yeah?

22:41.708 --> 22:43.958
- 38...
- Thirty-eight?

22:44.042 --> 22:46.042
- 87...
- Eight seven?

22:46.167 --> 22:48.000
- 34...
- Three, four.

22:48.083 --> 22:51.417
- 96...
- Ninety-six. What's your name?

22:51.583 --> 22:53.083
- Ely.
- Ely.

23:07.042 --> 23:08.625
- Hi.
- Hi.

23:23.542 --> 23:26.542
- What are you up to?
- Nothing, just watching TV.

23:26.708 --> 23:28.667
Have you eaten?
There's rice in the fridge.

23:28.875 --> 23:31.083
I ate. I brought
you a few slices of pizza.

23:31.167 --> 23:33.583
I already ate.
I'm going to make myself a cup of tea.

23:33.667 --> 23:36.292
- Want me to make it for you?
- No, I'll do it.

23:36.833 --> 23:38.042
Did you get out?

23:38.125 --> 23:39.375
How did it go?

23:39.875 --> 23:40.750
Good...

23:42.625 --> 23:44.000
Did you call work?

23:44.292 --> 23:45.375
Tomorrow...

23:48.333 --> 23:49.750
I'm going to take a shower.

25:41.667 --> 25:43.875
Did you do the homework?

25:46.583 --> 25:47.625
Ely?

25:50.292 --> 25:53.000
- Why not?
- I couldn't...

25:54.000 --> 25:56.542
Why not? You had several days...

25:57.000 --> 25:59.208
I just couldn't, I had stuff to do...

25:59.750 --> 26:02.042
I see... did you read it?

26:03.875 --> 26:07.667
Read it here, and tell us what you think.

26:07.833 --> 26:09.667
I don't have the photocopy.

26:09.875 --> 26:13.375
Can someone lend her
the photocopy? Sofi...?

26:16.083 --> 26:17.875
I don't like reading out loud.

26:17.958 --> 26:20.000
Come on, Ely... read it.

26:26.083 --> 26:31.000
"In 1976, the foreign debt
stood at eight billion dollars.

26:31.083 --> 26:36.042
By the end of the dictatorship,
it had climbed to over 43 billion.

26:36.167 --> 26:39.792
In a regime of over indebtedness,
more and more public resources

26:39.917 --> 26:42.417
were assigned to servicing the debt.

26:42.542 --> 26:46.208
That became the State's sole function.

26:46.917 --> 26:51.417
The country was unable
to make the payments on time,

26:51.542 --> 26:54.375
and forced to submit
to austerity programs

26:54.458 --> 26:58.542
imposed by lending organizations
to obtain further loans.

26:58.708 --> 27:02.875
The austerity programs
seeked to obtain more credit

27:02.958 --> 27:06.417
in order to pay off debt, and so on".

27:08.167 --> 27:14.417
Tell me in your own words
how the over indebtedness regime worked.

27:14.583 --> 27:15.792
I don't know.

27:17.250 --> 27:22.208
What were
the international lending organizations?

27:47.167 --> 27:49.375
- Hello.
- Hello. I'm here to see Adriana.

27:52.792 --> 27:54.000
Come on in.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.375
- Go on in...
- Hi.

28:01.875 --> 28:04.708
- Hi. How are you?
- How's it going?

28:04.875 --> 28:06.500
How's your mom? Any better?

28:06.583 --> 28:09.500
- Yeah, better.
- Good. I'm glad.

28:11.042 --> 28:18.000
Well, this is an advance in the hopes
that we reach an agreement.

28:18.167 --> 28:19.250
Right...

28:19.583 --> 28:24.042
It's not much, but it's a show
of good faith from the agency;

28:24.167 --> 28:27.375
we want to work this out
once and for all.

28:29.708 --> 28:34.667
Please tell your mom to send
formal written notice

28:34.833 --> 28:38.542
and then we can give you the rest.

28:40.667 --> 28:43.750
If your mom wants to take us to court,

28:43.833 --> 28:47.458
okay, that's her decision,

28:47.542 --> 28:52.125
but tell her the lawyer
ends up keeping half the money.

28:52.208 --> 28:55.000
And we can pay her
the rest in installments.

28:56.917 --> 29:01.833
I think that the best thing for her,
not for us,

29:02.292 --> 29:04.583
is to comply with the agreement...

29:06.042 --> 29:09.292
Did you bring me
the signed authorization?

29:09.458 --> 29:11.958
The receipt and her ID...

29:13.667 --> 29:14.417
Here.

29:14.583 --> 29:17.625
Please sign this receipt
and count the money...

29:17.708 --> 29:19.000
OK.

29:24.167 --> 29:26.250
Are you looking for work?

29:27.958 --> 29:29.083
Yeah...

29:30.417 --> 29:32.000
Have you turned eighteen?

29:34.417 --> 29:36.083
Are you still in high school?

29:36.625 --> 29:37.917
I graduated.

30:09.083 --> 30:11.417
- What happened?
- She ran out in front of the car.

30:11.583 --> 30:13.333
We're gonna have to operate...

30:25.708 --> 30:28.375
You're ready
to stitch up her bladder, right?

30:28.458 --> 30:31.208
- All set.
- Good, dry her off there.

30:35.042 --> 30:38.250
Good... how much are we giving her?

30:41.792 --> 30:43.542
About sixty.

30:43.667 --> 30:45.125
Bring it down a little.

30:47.292 --> 30:50.250
- Forty?
- Yes. Dry her off.

30:52.583 --> 30:53.750
Gauze...

30:54.417 --> 30:55.500
Ely.

31:00.167 --> 31:03.000
Raul, have you changed dollars yet?

31:03.167 --> 31:05.667
- I told you I haven't yet, Dad.
- OK.

31:06.125 --> 31:07.250
Stop.

31:11.542 --> 31:14.000
- Ely, are you taking off?
- Yup...

31:16.042 --> 31:18.542
The dog has to get her medication.

31:18.667 --> 31:22.375
Could you stay a little longer,
a few hours, until Gladys gets here...

31:24.792 --> 31:27.583
- I guess so.
- Great, I'll show you what to do.

31:59.583 --> 32:01.542
FREE WOMEN

32:02.708 --> 32:05.000
HOW CAN I ABORT WITH PILLS?

32:05.167 --> 32:08.292
IT IS ILLEGAL, BUT IN ARGENTINA,
YOU CAN GET ABORTION PILLS

32:10.708 --> 32:14.375
Until the 12th week you can provoke
an abortion with pills

32:14.458 --> 32:16.708
with 97% of success.

33:05.833 --> 33:06.833
Hello.

33:09.583 --> 33:11.375
This is she, who's calling?

33:12.083 --> 33:14.000
Right. How's it going?

33:19.958 --> 33:20.958
All right.

33:21.833 --> 33:24.708
Yeah. So what's next?

33:27.458 --> 33:28.667
Yes, yes.

33:30.333 --> 33:32.417
How much are they?

33:37.167 --> 33:38.542
All twelve?

33:40.042 --> 33:41.250
OK.

33:43.542 --> 33:44.667
Yeah...

33:47.458 --> 33:48.542
Yes, sure.

33:49.542 --> 33:51.292
In half an hour.

34:11.083 --> 34:12.917
- Hello.
- How's it going?

34:15.500 --> 34:16.625
Here's what you need...

34:16.708 --> 34:17.875
Good.

34:38.708 --> 34:40.250
- All set.
- All right.

34:40.333 --> 34:41.542
- OK, bye.
- Bye.

34:41.667 --> 34:43.125
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

35:10.208 --> 35:15.375
It looks natural,
it doesn't look like... fake buttocks...

35:16.417 --> 35:19.875
It has to be applied
by a plastic surgeon...

36:53.458 --> 36:54.750
Good morning.

37:04.292 --> 37:06.250
The car behind the motorcycle,

37:06.417 --> 37:11.000
the motorcycle, due to the speed
and the circumstances, swerved.

37:11.583 --> 37:17.542
The suspect heads back and fires
the six shots on the street,

37:17.667 --> 37:20.375
plus the two near
the butcher's shop...

37:20.458 --> 37:24.083
he gets off his motorcycle
to take one last shot...

37:29.000 --> 37:30.875
The car and the motorcycle collide...

37:32.833 --> 37:34.833
- Is it good?
- Great.

37:41.792 --> 37:43.958
I'm going to start washing the dishes.

37:46.958 --> 37:48.667
More mashed potatoes?

38:07.833 --> 38:12.208
According to government statistics,
32% of Argentines live in poverty.

38:14.417 --> 38:17.000
The regions hardest
hit are the northeast,

38:17.167 --> 38:19.917
and the city of Buenos Aires
and surrounding areas.

38:21.208 --> 38:24.667
Strikes at the banks
for the second straight day.

38:26.708 --> 38:28.333
Do you want to take a walk?

38:29.833 --> 38:31.167
No, not today.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.792
I'm kind of tired.

38:34.167 --> 38:35.958
I'm going to lie down for a while.

38:36.042 --> 38:37.583
Just a short walk...

38:38.708 --> 38:42.375
over to Parque Lezama
and to get a cup of coffee...

38:43.583 --> 38:44.875
No, not now...

38:46.417 --> 38:49.833
I've got to take a shower
and it's cold outside...

38:49.958 --> 38:51.542
Tomorrow.

38:55.792 --> 38:57.542
You have to get out, Mom.

39:00.167 --> 39:02.792
I wanted to call the office today...

39:37.583 --> 39:38.958
- Hello?
- It's me.

39:46.458 --> 39:47.875
"After the first dose,

39:47.958 --> 39:50.000
the woman will start bleeding
and cramping.

39:50.083 --> 39:54.292
The bleeding usually starts
within four hours of inserting the pills,

39:54.417 --> 39:56.000
though it may be longer.

39:56.083 --> 40:00.875
The bleeding is the first sign
that the abortion is underway.

40:00.958 --> 40:04.292
If it continues, the bleeding
will get heavier and cramping stronger.

40:04.417 --> 40:07.833
The bleeding is heavier
than a normal period

40:07.958 --> 40:09.792
and there might be blood clots.

40:09.917 --> 40:12.667
The more advanced the pregnancy,
the stronger the cramps

40:12.833 --> 40:14.292
and the heavier the bleeding.

40:14.375 --> 40:17.625
Once the abortion is complete,
the bleeding and cramping diminish.

40:17.792 --> 40:22.375
Bleeding and cramping may reach
a peak when the abortion

40:22.458 --> 40:24.833
actually takes place.

40:24.958 --> 40:28.375
If the abortion did not take
place after the third dose,

40:28.458 --> 40:31.042
you should try again in a few days,

40:31.125 --> 40:33.708
or go to a country where abortion is legal

40:33.792 --> 40:35.667
or find a qualified doctor.

40:35.833 --> 40:39.375
The doctor will probably request
a sonogram".

40:39.458 --> 40:41.958
What's a sonogram?

40:45.417 --> 40:46.667
I don't know...

40:48.458 --> 40:50.292
When can we do it?

40:51.583 --> 40:53.958
My folks are going away next weekend...

40:55.583 --> 40:57.542
which gives us almost two full days.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.708
They come back on Sunday night.

41:01.958 --> 41:04.042
We have to buy a lot of cotton

41:04.167 --> 41:07.375
and a few towels
that we can throw out after.

41:07.667 --> 41:11.792
It'd be great to have an old mattress
that we can get rid of afterwards.

42:44.333 --> 42:46.708
We're out of here.

42:46.875 --> 42:48.125
Hi.

42:48.208 --> 42:49.375
- You good?
- Yeah.

42:49.458 --> 42:51.542
- You sure? You're not mad?
- No.

42:51.708 --> 42:53.167
Do you have money? Keys? Your phone?

42:53.333 --> 42:55.542
- I've got everything.
- Love you, buddy.

42:59.708 --> 43:01.417
- Bye.
- Bye.

46:47.458 --> 46:50.542
Ely, can you take the
dog out for a walk?

46:50.667 --> 46:52.167
She has to start moving...

46:52.333 --> 46:53.292
Sure.

47:32.208 --> 47:33.292
Hi.

47:34.250 --> 47:35.667
You're gonna take her out?

47:36.333 --> 47:38.375
Great, she has to walk a little.

50:13.917 --> 50:15.625
- What's the matter, Mom?
- Nothing.

50:15.792 --> 50:17.917
- What happened?
- Nothing.

50:18.042 --> 50:19.167
Why are you crying?

50:20.917 --> 50:24.292
No reason... I just felt like crying.

50:30.042 --> 50:31.542
You have to get out, Mom...

50:32.042 --> 50:34.875
You can't spend the whole day
cooped up in here.

50:35.292 --> 50:37.792
Go downstairs to the entrance,
go for a walk or something...

50:37.917 --> 50:39.417
I don't want to go out.

50:39.542 --> 50:42.625
You don't do anything.
You have to get out, go outside.

50:43.083 --> 50:44.042
Where would I go?

50:44.167 --> 50:46.958
Call up a friend, go get a cup of coffee.

50:47.042 --> 50:51.792
We don't see your sister,
we don't go to family birthday parties...

50:51.917 --> 50:54.792
- Your aunt is busy.
- Just pick up the phone.

50:54.875 --> 50:59.417
I'm tired of talking on the phone.
She doesn't call me either.

50:59.583 --> 51:01.625
You have excuse for everything!

51:02.208 --> 51:04.167
- You're gonna get sick, Mom.
- I'm fine.

51:04.333 --> 51:05.958
- You're not fine.
- I'm fine.

51:06.042 --> 51:08.583
You have to work,
you have to do something.

51:08.917 --> 51:11.292
How are we going to get by?

51:11.417 --> 51:12.917
I'm exhausted.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.083
I'm gonna get over this soon.

51:19.542 --> 51:21.917
You know what? I'm sick of you.

51:26.958 --> 51:28.417
You're gonna die like that.

53:00.667 --> 53:04.042
Sorry, I'm sort of out of it today.

53:07.333 --> 53:08.833
Is something wrong?

53:11.917 --> 53:12.917
Are you OK?

53:12.958 --> 53:14.125
Yeah.

53:24.958 --> 53:27.792
I gotta get back.
Is something the matter?

53:32.042 --> 53:33.792
I'm pregnant.

53:39.167 --> 53:41.000
What do you mean "I'm pregnant"?

53:43.083 --> 53:44.292
I'm pregnant.

53:51.208 --> 53:53.833
Are you sure? Did you see a doctor?

53:53.958 --> 53:54.917
Yes.

54:03.542 --> 54:04.917
Is it mine?

54:11.500 --> 54:15.000
- But we always used protection.
- Not always.

54:30.167 --> 54:31.958
Have you told anyone?

54:35.083 --> 54:38.208
- You know there's no way.
- I'm not going to have it.

54:39.458 --> 54:42.250
That's for the best. You're too young...

54:46.917 --> 54:48.250
Do you have a plan?

54:50.042 --> 54:51.375
Pills.

54:56.375 --> 54:59.125
Let me think about it.
We'll figure out what to do tomorrow.

55:01.792 --> 55:04.250
It's gonna be all right, don't worry.

55:05.667 --> 55:07.542
I have to get back.

55:21.250 --> 55:24.833
A respectful round of applause
for our flag.

55:34.958 --> 55:40.833
We will now sing the
National Flag Anthem.

56:40.083 --> 56:41.500
Ely!

56:42.833 --> 56:44.958
Ely, come on!

56:59.083 --> 57:03.542
It's reliable, like a health center
where everything is monitored,

57:03.625 --> 57:05.500
one hundred percent safe.

57:12.667 --> 57:15.042
The sooner, the better, and less risky...

57:18.083 --> 57:19.542
I'll go with you.

57:26.500 --> 57:27.500
Here.

57:30.833 --> 57:32.417
Call now.

57:32.583 --> 57:35.625
Ask for Gloria. She'll give you
an appointment and instructions.

57:43.917 --> 57:47.125
Don't worry about the money,
I'll take care of it...

57:52.375 --> 57:54.917
They do this all the time

57:54.958 --> 57:57.833
so there's nothing to worry about.

58:03.500 --> 58:06.042
I gotta get back,
I'll drop you at the corner.

58:07.333 --> 58:08.833
Call her.

58:28.917 --> 58:31.208
Hello?

59:15.875 --> 59:19.375
Did you call?
That woman, did you call her?

59:19.458 --> 59:21.292
She didn't pick up.

59:21.417 --> 59:23.708
- Call her again.
- I will.

59:24.208 --> 59:26.042
I told her we'd see her today.

01:00:13.333 --> 01:00:14.958
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:00:15.042 --> 01:00:17.125
- Are you Eloisa?
- Yeah.

01:00:17.208 --> 01:00:19.708
I'm Gloria. Have a seat...

01:00:20.917 --> 01:00:24.167
- Do you want something to drink?
- No, thanks.

01:00:24.333 --> 01:00:27.208
- Do you get here all right?
- Yes.

01:00:27.667 --> 01:00:29.208
You managed to find the place?

01:00:31.292 --> 01:00:34.833
Like I explained on the phone...

01:00:34.958 --> 01:00:37.375
we do the procedure ourselves.

01:00:37.458 --> 01:00:40.000
It's carefully monitored
and very professional,

01:00:40.167 --> 01:00:42.958
with all the same precautions as at,
shall we say,

01:00:43.042 --> 01:00:45.125
a conventional health center...

01:00:47.042 --> 01:00:48.917
What do you mean "we"?

01:00:49.167 --> 01:00:50.458
I'll be there the whole time.

01:00:50.583 --> 01:00:53.625
There's a specialist in anaesthesia,
and the procedure itself

01:00:53.792 --> 01:00:57.500
will be performed by the doctor,
a certified gynecologist.

01:00:57.917 --> 01:00:59.500
How long does it take?

01:00:59.583 --> 01:01:01.667
About a half hour...

01:01:01.833 --> 01:01:05.958
You stay a little longer
to make sure everything's all right.

01:01:06.042 --> 01:01:09.958
All in all, it's a two-hour process.

01:01:10.042 --> 01:01:13.625
Ideally, someone would come with you,
just for your sake,

01:01:13.792 --> 01:01:15.917
so someone can keep you company.

01:01:16.042 --> 01:01:18.417
You can come by yourself if you prefer.

01:01:19.167 --> 01:01:20.625
Do they give you anesthesia?

01:01:20.792 --> 01:01:23.708
Yes, a mild one. You won't feel a thing.

01:01:23.792 --> 01:01:27.792
When you wake up, it's all over.
You can walk right out.

01:01:29.583 --> 01:01:34.167
Payment is done in cash
on the day of the procedure.

01:01:35.708 --> 01:01:37.625
Do you want to do it?

01:01:37.917 --> 01:01:40.625
We can schedule you for tomorrow
or the day after.

01:02:47.667 --> 01:02:49.542
Can you make room for me?

01:04:16.167 --> 01:04:17.458
Over there.

01:04:29.292 --> 01:04:31.000
I'll wait around the corner.

01:05:23.167 --> 01:05:24.125
Come on in.

01:05:39.875 --> 01:05:41.625
Shall we settle the payment?

01:06:43.042 --> 01:06:44.542
You can change in here.

01:06:44.708 --> 01:06:47.833
Take off everything
from the waist down and put on the gown.

01:06:47.958 --> 01:06:50.708
Lie down on the cot.
The doctor will be with you shortly.

01:11:21.167 --> 01:11:22.542
Hello?

01:11:23.458 --> 01:11:25.875
- What's the matter?
- I'm not going to do it.

01:11:25.958 --> 01:11:28.833
- I can't give you back the money.
- OK.

01:11:30.167 --> 01:11:34.000
- Can I wait in here a while?
- No problem.

01:12:05.458 --> 01:12:08.542
You have to leave
the last three numbers of your ID,

01:12:08.667 --> 01:12:13.125
and your name
for the story-of-the-day contest...

01:12:29.208 --> 01:12:30.458
So?

01:12:31.583 --> 01:12:34.333
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, it's done.

01:12:40.208 --> 01:12:42.417
- How do you feel?
- Fine.

01:12:47.167 --> 01:12:50.875
What did they say?
Do you need medication?

01:12:50.958 --> 01:12:52.792
I have to stay in bed.

01:12:57.917 --> 01:12:59.375
What do you want to do?

01:13:01.667 --> 01:13:04.042
Do you want to stay here a while?

01:13:04.167 --> 01:13:05.917
Take me home.

01:13:50.042 --> 01:13:52.000
What you did was for the best.

01:13:54.167 --> 01:13:59.292
Today was a rough day,
but in time, you'll see...

01:14:05.958 --> 01:14:07.917
You did the right thing.

01:15:25.292 --> 01:15:26.833
OK, I'm out.

01:15:30.458 --> 01:15:32.542
Call me if you need anything.

01:15:33.708 --> 01:15:36.667
Rest for the next few days, stay in bed.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.208
Yes.

01:15:40.625 --> 01:15:42.917
Take as long as you need.

01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:48.125
I'm out.

01:15:48.917 --> 01:15:49.917
Bye.

01:16:48.792 --> 01:16:49.958
Hi, Antonio.

01:16:51.833 --> 01:16:53.000
Yes, Ely.

01:16:53.958 --> 01:16:58.208
I wanted to let you know that
I won't be able to go back to work.

01:17:00.208 --> 01:17:01.167
Yes.

01:17:02.083 --> 01:17:03.667
Something came up.

01:17:05.792 --> 01:17:07.000
Yes.

01:17:11.167 --> 01:17:12.792
Yes.

01:17:12.917 --> 01:17:13.917
OK.

01:17:16.958 --> 01:17:18.542
I'm sorry.

01:17:19.458 --> 01:17:20.542
Bye.
