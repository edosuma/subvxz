WEBVTT

00:08.509 --> 00:10.611
MY SLIPPER!

00:10.611 --> 00:12.743
STAN! OHH!

00:12.743 --> 00:15.246
AT LEAST HE DIDN'T
TOUCH THIS ONE.

00:15.246 --> 00:16.587
Stan: HEY, I WAS
LOOKING FOR THAT!

00:19.190 --> 00:21.352
WHAT DO YOU HAVE
AGAINST ME?!

00:21.352 --> 00:23.554
"TOP TEN THINGS
I HAVE AGAINST ELLEN."

00:23.554 --> 00:24.795
( drum roll )

00:24.795 --> 00:28.699
NUMBER TEN:
SHE HATES DOGS.

00:28.699 --> 00:32.333
THAT'S ALSO REASONS
ONE THROUGH NINE.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.706
THIS IS MY THIRD SLIPPER
IN A MONTH.

00:35.706 --> 00:37.608
WHY DOES HE ONLY EAT
MY SLIPPERS?

00:37.608 --> 00:39.570
MOM, I'M SURE YOU'RE
JUST EXAGGERATING.

00:39.570 --> 00:42.173
OH, REALLY? HE DOESN'T TOUCH
YOUR FATHER'S SLIPPERS,

00:42.173 --> 00:45.676
AND HIS FEET, FOR SOME REASON,
SMELL NATURALLY OF HAM.

00:45.676 --> 00:51.522
AND I'LL ADD THAT TO THE LIST
OF DISTURBING THINGS I'VE
LEARNED ABOUT MY PARENTS.

00:51.522 --> 00:54.125
WELL, YOU SHOULD KNOCK
BEFORE ENTERING A ROOM.

00:54.125 --> 00:56.687
AND YOU SHOULD PUMICE
YOUR OWN FEET.

00:56.687 --> 00:59.260
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO
DO EACH OTHER'S?

00:59.260 --> 01:03.264
WE COULD DANCE SEPARATELY TOO.
SOME THINGS ARE MORE FUN
AS A COUPLE.

01:03.264 --> 01:05.736
THE POINT IS,
I HAVE HAD IT
WITH THAT DOG.

01:05.736 --> 01:08.469
I AM THIS CLOSE TO
BABYGATING THE WHOLE PLACE.

01:08.469 --> 01:10.301
YOU REALLY THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA?

01:13.504 --> 01:14.575
OHH!

01:16.577 --> 01:19.110
DID YOU EVER THINK
THAT STAN DOESN'T LIKE YOU

01:19.110 --> 01:21.582
BECAUSE HE SENSES
THAT YOU DON'T LIKE DOGS?

01:21.582 --> 01:25.656
SERIOUSLY? THAT'S LIKE SAYING
YOU DON'T LIKE JOY OR SMILES

01:25.656 --> 01:30.561
OR ARTHRITIC SQUIRRELS--
SO EASY TO CATCH.

01:30.561 --> 01:34.225
BUT DOGS ARE LOYAL AND LOVING
AND PROVIDE COMPANIONSHIP.

01:34.225 --> 01:38.269
SO WE CHEW UP
A FEW SLIPPERS, OR A PURSE.

01:38.269 --> 01:40.231
MMM. PRADA.

01:40.231 --> 01:43.474
HAVEN'T HAD ITALIAN
IN A WHILE.

01:43.474 --> 01:45.576
♪♪

02:03.294 --> 02:06.227
REBECCA, I THINK WE MADE
SOME REAL PROGRESS TODAY

02:06.227 --> 02:08.529
DEALING WITH YOUR SHYNESS,
DON'T YOU THINK?

02:09.860 --> 02:12.563
OKAY, WE'LL START OVER
FROM SQUARE ONE NEXT TIME.

02:15.436 --> 02:17.438
ARE YOU SPYING
ON DAD'S PATIENT?

02:17.438 --> 02:19.570
IT'S REBECCA DAVIS.

02:19.570 --> 02:21.612
SHE'S ONE OF THE PRETTIEST
GIRLS IN SCHOOL,

02:21.612 --> 02:23.844
BUT SHE WON'T GIVE ME
THE TIME OF DAY.

02:23.844 --> 02:26.617
HEY, REBECCA.
DO YOU KNOW THAT TIME IT IS?

02:29.680 --> 02:32.283
BUT SINCE SHE'S DAD'S PATIENT,
I CAN LEARN ALL ABOUT HER

02:32.283 --> 02:34.425
AND USE THAT INFORMATION
TO GET HER TO LIKE ME.

02:34.425 --> 02:37.288
LIKE IF SHE'S AFRAID OF HEIGHTS
I CAN APPROACH HER LIKE THIS.

02:41.332 --> 02:45.236
BUT WHAT IF SHE'S AFRAID
OF INCREDIBLY RIDICULOUS,
STUPID WALKS?

02:45.236 --> 02:49.300
DAD'LL CURE HER.
HE CURED THAT KID
WHO THOUGHT HE WAS A BAGEL.

02:50.941 --> 02:52.873
I JUST HAVE TO FIND OUT
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER.

02:52.873 --> 02:55.576
BUT DAD CAN'T TELL YOU
ABOUT HIS PATIENTS.

02:55.576 --> 02:57.548
SO EVEN IF YOU DID
LAND A DATE WITH HER,

02:57.548 --> 02:58.779
YOU'D HAVE TO HIDE IT FROM DAD,

02:58.779 --> 03:00.711
AND HIDE IT FROM HER
THAT HE'S YOUR DAD,

03:00.711 --> 03:02.653
WHICH MEANS NEVER
BRINGING HER HERE

03:02.653 --> 03:04.885
OR TELLING HER ANYTHING
ABOUT YOUR FAMILY.

03:04.885 --> 03:07.418
YEAH. I'M SEEING
NOTHING BUT GREEN LIGHTS.

03:10.661 --> 03:13.564
STAN, THIS IS NOT
GONNA HELP YOU WITH MOM.

03:13.564 --> 03:15.726
HOW CAN I LIKE HER
WHEN SHE DOESN'T LIKE ME?

03:15.726 --> 03:17.898
SHE CALLS HERSELF
A CAT PERSON.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.970
SURE, SHE'S MAINLY
INSULTING HERSELF,

03:19.970 --> 03:22.933
BUT HOW DO YOU THINK
THAT MAKES ME FEEL?

03:22.933 --> 03:26.677
MOM, I THINK STAN SENSES
THAT YOU DON'T LIKE HIM.

03:26.677 --> 03:29.440
I DON'T. I'M A CAT PERSON.

03:29.440 --> 03:31.242
( Stan barks )

03:31.242 --> 03:34.415
IT DOES SOUND HURTFUL
THE WAY YOU SAY IT.

03:34.415 --> 03:37.288
DINNER'S READY.
WHERE'S MY OVEN MITT?

03:38.789 --> 03:40.291
ARE YOU SEEING THIS?!

03:40.291 --> 03:42.793
THAT DOG CHEWS THROUGH
EVERYTHING OF MINE!

03:42.793 --> 03:44.525
I HAVE HAD IT.
I CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS.

03:44.525 --> 03:46.257
MOM, YOU'RE UPSET.

03:46.257 --> 03:47.528
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
RATIONALLY.

03:47.528 --> 03:51.502
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER IF YOU JUST
SIT DOWN AND RELAX.

03:51.502 --> 03:53.304
OHH!

03:55.366 --> 03:58.339
HE CHEWED THROUGH
MY CHAIR!

03:58.339 --> 04:00.811
Stan: DARN! I WAS SO BUSY
EATING THE BUTTONS OFF HER COAT

04:00.811 --> 04:02.613
I MISSED IT!

04:02.613 --> 04:06.317
I'M SURE HE CHEWED
THROUGH MINE, TOO.

04:11.722 --> 04:13.924
MAN, THESE CHAIRS
ARE ROCK SOLID.

04:16.357 --> 04:18.659
HA HA HA HA!
BENNETT! DO SOMETHING!

04:18.659 --> 04:20.291
I'M ON IT.

04:21.662 --> 04:24.735
BENNETT, THAT DOG
HAS CHEWED THROUGH
THE LAST OF MY THINGS.

04:24.735 --> 04:27.498
WE ARE GETTING A DOGHOUSE
AND KEEPING STAN
IN THE BACKYARD.

04:27.498 --> 04:28.899
MAYBE I WENT TOO FAR.

04:28.899 --> 04:30.601
BETTER GO HIDE THAT COAT.

04:30.601 --> 04:33.944
THOSE BUTTONS AREN'T GONNA
FINISH THEIR FANTASTIC VOYAGE

04:33.944 --> 04:35.646
UNTIL TOMORROW.

04:35.646 --> 04:40.451
I WILL NOT HAVE THAT DOG
MAKING ME LOOK FOOLISH
IN MY OWN HOME!

04:45.055 --> 04:49.520
OH, MOM, YOU'RE NOT
STILL READING THAT
DOGHOUSE CATALOG, ARE YOU?

04:49.520 --> 04:51.021
DID YOU KNOW THEY HAVE
A WHOLE SECTION

04:51.021 --> 04:53.564
OF PRISON-THEMED ONES
FOR BAD DOGS?

04:53.564 --> 04:57.498
CAN'T DECIDE
BETWEEN "BARKATRAZ"
OR "SAN QUIN-TIN-TIN."

04:57.498 --> 05:00.731
LOOK, BEFORE YOU
PUT STAN OUTSIDE,

05:00.731 --> 05:03.804
I JUST WANT YOU TO CONSIDER
THAT MAYBE STAN HAS
A PROBLEM WITH YOU

05:03.804 --> 05:06.076
BECAUSE YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH HIM.

05:06.076 --> 05:08.509
I WHIPPED UP
A LITTLE POWERPOINT

05:08.509 --> 05:10.941
ON THE BENEFITS OF
BONDING WITH AN ANIMAL.

05:10.941 --> 05:14.745
"THE BENEFITS OF
ENROLLING YOUR SON
IN MILITARY SCHOOL"?

05:14.745 --> 05:17.588
OOPSY-DAISY, THAT'S FOR
ANOTHER TIME.

05:17.588 --> 05:19.650
( tapping keyboard )

05:19.650 --> 05:21.692
ALL RIGHT,
HERE WE GO.

05:21.692 --> 05:24.425
BONDING WITH AN ANIMAL
CAN LOWER YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE.

05:25.926 --> 05:28.859
IT HELPS YOU LIVE LONGER.

05:28.859 --> 05:32.002
AND PEOPLE WHO BOND WITH ANIMALS
ARE WARMER, KINDER PEOPLE.

05:32.002 --> 05:35.506
ARE YOU SAYING I'M NOT
A WARM, KIND PERSON?!

05:35.506 --> 05:37.438
NO, NO, NO, YOU ARE.

05:38.709 --> 05:41.942
YOU JUST NEED TO EMBRACE
THAT PART OF YOURSELF. AND...

05:41.942 --> 05:45.345
ANIMALS WILL EMBRACE YOU.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.418
THAT'LL BE THE DAY.

05:47.418 --> 05:49.820
MOM, YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO DOESN'T GET ALONG WITH STAN.

05:49.820 --> 05:52.122
DON'T YOU EVER FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE MISSING OUT?

05:52.122 --> 05:54.585
( happy chatter )

05:54.585 --> 05:57.127
HEY, GUYS!
ANYONE WANT TO
PLAY CHARADES?

05:58.759 --> 06:00.060
OKAY,
I'LL PLAY BY MYSELF.

06:01.462 --> 06:02.733
"FOOTLOOSE."

06:02.733 --> 06:04.635
( laughing )
YOU'RE GOOD AT THIS, ELLEN.

06:04.635 --> 06:06.437
( happy chatter
continues )

06:09.099 --> 06:11.802
NO. I NEVER FEEL LIKE
I'M MISSING OUT.

06:11.802 --> 06:14.004
IF ANYONE'S MISSING OUT,
STAN'S MISSING OUT.

06:14.004 --> 06:17.408
I HAVE BEEN TOLD ON
MORE THAN ONE OCCASION THAT
I'M A HOOT AND A HALF.

06:17.408 --> 06:19.780
YES, I BELIEVE
I'VE SAID THAT TO YOU TWICE.

06:19.780 --> 06:22.052
BUT YOU COULD BE UPWARDS
OF TWO HOOTS

06:22.052 --> 06:24.585
IF YOU ALSO BECAME
AN ANIMAL PERSON.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.457
BUT I AM AN ANIMAL PERSON.

06:26.457 --> 06:27.758
REALLY? WHAT ABOUT
THAT CAMEL?

06:27.758 --> 06:30.020
THEY SPIT ON EVERYBODY!

06:30.020 --> 06:32.823
THE ZOOKEEPER SAID
IT WAS MOST SPIT
HE'D EVER SEEN.

06:32.823 --> 06:35.726
I ONLY WISH I HADN'T
HAD MY MOUTH OPEN.

06:35.726 --> 06:38.729
I JUST WANT YOU TO FEEL
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BOND
WITH AN ANIMAL

06:38.729 --> 06:41.071
LIKE WE DO.
HELLO, STAN.

06:41.071 --> 06:42.773
I SEE YOUR POINT.

06:42.773 --> 06:44.675
I WILL GIVE IT A TRY.

06:44.675 --> 06:46.737
I GOT A PARROT!

06:47.938 --> 06:50.881
Parrot: (squawks)
HELLO!

06:57.748 --> 07:00.921
MEET OUR NEW PET LUCY.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.493
PET? NEW?

07:02.493 --> 07:04.895
THAT WOULD SEEM TO SUGGEST
THERE'S AN OLD PET SOMEWHERE.

07:04.895 --> 07:08.659
WAIT A MINUTE...

07:08.659 --> 07:09.860
YOU GOT A BIRD?
MOM,

07:09.860 --> 07:11.161
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

07:11.161 --> 07:14.665
DID I MISLEAD YOU WITH
THE USE OF THE WORD "HOOT"?

07:14.665 --> 07:16.436
WHY DOES MOMMY
GET A BIRD?

07:16.436 --> 07:18.869
YOU WOULDN'T LET ME KEEP
THAT BIRD THAT STAN GAVE ME.

07:18.869 --> 07:20.871
THAT WAS HALF A BIRD,
SWEETIE.

07:20.871 --> 07:24.144
BUT I GLUED IT TO
THE HALF A MOUSE
HE BROUGHT ME.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.647
I MISS MY BOUSE.

07:27.818 --> 07:29.780
THE GREAT THING
ABOUT THIS PET IS,

07:29.780 --> 07:31.221
SHE CAN TALK.

07:31.221 --> 07:32.883
SAY, "I LOVE ELLEN."

07:32.883 --> 07:33.924
(squawks)
I LOVE ELLEN.

07:33.924 --> 07:36.156
WHOA!
WOW!

07:36.156 --> 07:38.859
COME ON! I CAN TALK.

07:38.859 --> 07:41.932
THAT'S MY THING!
THIS IS SO FRUSTRATING.

07:41.932 --> 07:43.033
( barks )

07:43.033 --> 07:44.895
QUIET, STAN.
LUCY'S TALKING.

07:44.895 --> 07:46.767
(squawks)
QUIET, STAN.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.038
( all exclaim )

07:48.038 --> 07:50.941
THIS JUST GOT PERSONAL.

07:50.941 --> 07:53.944
ARE YOU ALWAYS
SO SMART?

07:53.944 --> 07:56.006
( angry squawking )

07:56.006 --> 07:57.608
Bennett:
IS THAT BIRD TAME?

07:57.608 --> 07:59.049
MY BOUSE NEVER DID THAT.

07:59.049 --> 08:02.152
HE JUST LAID QUIETLY
ON MY PILLOW AND SMELLED FUNNY.

08:04.014 --> 08:05.656
MAYBE THAT WAS JUST
TOO MANY PEOPLE.

08:05.656 --> 08:09.560
EXCUSE ME, GIRLS.
LET YOUR DADDY HANDLE THIS.

08:09.560 --> 08:11.161
HELLO THERE, PRETTY--

08:11.161 --> 08:13.223
( angry squaw)

08:13.223 --> 08:16.567
DON'T WORRY.
LUCY'S VERY NICE.

08:16.567 --> 08:18.799
SHE'S JUST ADJUSTING.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.500
All: OOH!

08:20.500 --> 08:23.834
SHE JUST POOPED
ALL OVER YOUR SHOE.

08:23.834 --> 08:26.737
I'M AN ANIMAL PERSON,
SO IT DOESN'T FAZE ME.

08:26.737 --> 08:30.541
AND HER CLAWS ARE
DIGGING INTO MY HAND,
WHICH ALSO DOESN'T FAZE ME.

08:30.541 --> 08:32.082
I'M JUST GONNA GO GET
LUCY IN HER CAGE,

08:32.082 --> 08:34.945
CHANGE MY SHOES,
AND FIELD DRESS THIS WOUND.

08:38.889 --> 08:43.023
OKAY, I THINK WE'VE MADE
A REAL BREAKTHROUGH IN
YOUR SHYNESS, REBECCA.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.055
IN FACT, YOU MIGHT EVEN
BE READY FOR A JOKE.

08:45.055 --> 08:46.627
KNOCK KNOCK.

08:48.258 --> 08:51.531
OKAY, MAYBE NEXT WEEK
WE'LL FIND OUT WHO'S THERE!

08:52.833 --> 08:55.736
STILL NO PROGRESS
WITH PATIENT "R."

08:55.736 --> 08:57.638
I DIDN'T EVEN GET TO
FINISH MY JOKE.

08:57.638 --> 09:00.270
WITHOUT GOING INTO MUCH DETAIL,
IT WAS "KNOCK KNOCK.

09:00.270 --> 09:03.213
WHO'S THERE? BOO.
BOO WHO? DON'T CRY."
HA HA HA!

09:03.213 --> 09:05.646
HELLO!
DAD.

09:05.646 --> 09:08.048
YOU NEED ANY HELP?

09:08.048 --> 09:10.320
ANY INSIGHT INTO
THE TEENAGE MIND?

09:10.320 --> 09:13.083
YOU MEAN LIKE WITH
THAT REALLY PRETTY GIRL
WHO WAS JUST HERE?

09:13.083 --> 09:16.286
WAS THERE A PRETTY GIRL HERE?
I DIDN'T NOTICE.
WHAT'S HER PROBLEM?

09:16.286 --> 09:18.729
TYLER, ONE OF US KNOWS
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

09:18.729 --> 09:20.691
IS IT ME?

09:22.633 --> 09:25.165
( parrot squawking loudly )

09:25.165 --> 09:28.038
( squawking )
LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT.

09:28.038 --> 09:30.340
THIS IS MY FAMILY,
AND I DON'T LIKE
YOU HORNING IN.

09:30.340 --> 09:32.743
I'M THE ONE WHO'S SPECIAL--
I TALK!

09:32.743 --> 09:34.144
(squawks) I TALK.

09:34.144 --> 09:37.107
YOU DON'T TALK.
YOU JUST REPEAT
WHAT I SAY.

09:37.107 --> 09:38.849
YOU JUST REPEAT
WHAT I SAY.

09:38.849 --> 09:40.210
YOU JUST REPEAT
WHAT I SAY.

09:40.210 --> 09:41.682
YOU JUST REPEAT
WHAT I SAY.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.213
YOU JUST REPEAT
WHAT I SAY.

09:43.213 --> 09:44.785
YOU JUST REPEAT
WHAT I SAY.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.156
THAT'S PARROTING.

09:46.156 --> 09:49.860
OH, THAT'S WHERE
THAT COMES FROM!

09:52.262 --> 09:53.824
( squawking )

09:53.824 --> 09:56.266
( squawking continues )

10:00.030 --> 10:02.132
STAN, ARE YOU SLEEPING
THROUGH THIS?

10:02.132 --> 10:05.706
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I AM DOG TIRED.

10:05.706 --> 10:09.039
OH, THAT'S WHERE
THAT COMES FROM!

10:09.039 --> 10:11.311
WHAT A HORRIBLE NIGHT!

10:11.311 --> 10:13.744
I WAS DREAMING
THAT I WAS A BIRD,

10:13.744 --> 10:15.315
AND WHEN I OPENED MY MOUTH,

10:15.315 --> 10:17.617
THE ONLY THING
THAT CAME OUT WAS--
( squawks )

10:17.617 --> 10:18.889
WAS THAT ME?

10:20.390 --> 10:22.953
DID LUCY
WAKE YOU GUYS UP TOO?

10:22.953 --> 10:25.726
NO. THE HORRIFIC SQUAWKING
WAS VERY RESTFUL.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.157
( squawking )

10:27.157 --> 10:29.860
I'M SORRY. YOU KNOW HOW
EXHAUSTION MAKES ME SARCASTIC.

10:29.860 --> 10:32.833
NICE JAMMIES,
LITTLE TIMMY.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.005
YEAH, I REALLY NEED
SOME SLEEP.

10:35.005 --> 10:38.268
I SEE YOU GUYS ARE UP
TO SAY GOOD MORNING TO LUCY.

10:38.268 --> 10:40.640
ISN'T IT NICE TO HAVE
AN EARLY MORNING WAKE-UP CALL?

10:40.640 --> 10:42.242
WE CAN ALL GET
A JUMP ON THE DAY.

10:42.242 --> 10:45.375
( squawking )
ISN'T THAT A PRETTY SONG
YOU'RE SINGING, LUCY?

10:45.375 --> 10:47.277
( squawking )
( squawking )

10:47.277 --> 10:53.153
YOU SOUND LIKE TWO VELOCIRAPTORS
FIGHTING OVER A BAGPIPE.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.685
Tyler: OHH!

10:54.685 --> 10:57.087
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
WE CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS!

10:57.087 --> 10:59.229
OOH. WHAT IF WE
COVER THE CAGE?

10:59.229 --> 11:01.231
MAYBE THE BIRD WILL SLEEP
UNTIL WE UNCOVER IT.

11:01.231 --> 11:04.364
I KNOW. WHY DON'T WE
TRY THIS TONIGHT?

11:04.364 --> 11:06.196
( squawking stops )
HEY.

11:06.196 --> 11:10.701
( loud, angry squawking )

11:10.701 --> 11:14.274
WELL, IT WASN'T THE BEST BLANKET
YOUR GRANDMA EVER KNITTED--

11:14.274 --> 11:17.207
JUST THE LAST.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.052
HUH.

11:22.052 --> 11:24.254
WOW, THE BIRD IS SO QUIET.

11:24.254 --> 11:26.116
NO WONDER WE SLEPT SO LATE.

11:26.116 --> 11:28.759
MAYBE SHE'S FINALLY ADJUSTED
TO HER NEW ENVIRON--

11:28.759 --> 11:29.990
AAH! HIT THE DIRT!

11:31.691 --> 11:33.764
COME HERE, LUCY!
COME HERE, SWEETIE!

11:33.764 --> 11:35.025
COME TO MOMMY!

11:35.025 --> 11:36.997
PROTECT YOUR EYES!

11:39.870 --> 11:43.333
ISN'T SHE THE CUTEST,
SWEETEST THING?

11:43.333 --> 11:47.808
BOY, IF I HAD A BOULDER
I COULD KILL TWO BIRDS
WITH ONE STONE.

11:47.808 --> 11:51.311
OH, THAT'S WHERE
THAT COMES FROM!

11:51.311 --> 11:53.744
OH, SHE HAD A LITTLE
ACCIDENT ON MY HEAD AGAIN.

11:55.015 --> 11:57.948
NO, FALSE ALARM.
JUST BLOOD.

11:57.948 --> 12:01.321
IT'S FUNNY.
SHE THINKS I'M A FIELD MOUSE.

12:01.321 --> 12:02.953
MOM.
YES?

12:02.953 --> 12:05.996
WHEN I SUGGESTED THAT
YOU BECOME AN ANIMAL PERSON,

12:05.996 --> 12:09.830
I DIDN'T MEAN FOR YOU TO BECOME
THE BIRD LADY OF CRAZYTOWN.

12:09.830 --> 12:12.062
MAYBE YOU'RE JUST NOT
ANIMAL PEOPLE.

12:12.062 --> 12:14.765
BUT LUCY IS MY PET
AND I LOVE HER.

12:14.765 --> 12:18.308
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I'M GOING TO GO BLEED
INTO A CUP AND FEED IT TO HER.

12:18.308 --> 12:20.971
IT'S THE ONLY THING
THAT RELAXES HER TALONS.

12:22.973 --> 12:25.846
DAD, ISN'T THERE SOMETHING
WE CAN DO?

12:25.846 --> 12:29.219
I'VE TRIED, BUT YOUR MOTHER
JUST WILL NOT ADMIT THAT
THAT BIRD WAS A MISTAKE.

12:29.219 --> 12:31.351
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA CALL THE PET STORE

12:31.351 --> 12:33.383
AND SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY ADVICE
FOR HOW TO HANDLE HER.

12:33.383 --> 12:36.056
THE BIRD OR MOM?
I'LL TAKE EITHER ONE.

12:39.189 --> 12:41.131
( parrot squawking )

12:41.131 --> 12:43.293
SHH!
(squawk)

12:43.293 --> 12:45.996
DAD CAN GET ALL THE ADVICE
FROM THE PET STORE
THAT HE WANTS,

12:45.996 --> 12:47.767
BUT WE HAVE TO
GET RID OF THIS BIRD.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.901
WHY?
BECAUSE IT'S KEEPING US UP
ALL NIGHT, RAGGEDY ANN!

12:52.242 --> 12:53.944
I REALLY NEED SOME SLEEP.

12:53.944 --> 12:56.176
OH. THAT WAS THE BIRD?

12:56.176 --> 12:58.879
I THOUGHT IT WAS MOMMY
SCREAMING AT DADDY

12:58.879 --> 13:01.311
TO WASH HIS STINKIN'
HAM FEET.

13:01.311 --> 13:04.214
WE'VE GOTTA MAKE MOM
HATE THIS BIRD
AS MUCH AS WE DO.

13:04.214 --> 13:06.386
OH! WHAT IF THE BIRD
STEALS HER IDENTITY

13:06.386 --> 13:10.320
AND OPENS
A PIZZA PARLOR FOR DOGS
CALLED PIZZA MUTT?

13:10.320 --> 13:12.092
EVEN IF IT DOESN'T
GET RID OF THE BIRD,

13:12.092 --> 13:15.365
THERE'LL BE
A PIZZA PARLOR FOR DOGS!

13:15.365 --> 13:20.230
OR WHAT IF WE SAY
THE BIRD SPILLED MOMMY'S
EXPENSIVE PERFUME IN THE TOILET?

13:20.230 --> 13:22.332
'CAUSE SOMEBODY DID THAT.

13:23.904 --> 13:27.277
NO. WHAT WE ARE GONNA DO
IS MAKE THE BIRD SAY THINGS

13:27.277 --> 13:28.808
THAT MOM'S NOT GONNA LIKE.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.541
WHY ISN'T TYLER HELPING?
BECAUSE TYLER'S A JERK.

13:31.541 --> 13:34.084
(squawks)
TYLER'S A JERK.

13:34.084 --> 13:35.415
GOOD! BUT YOU GOTTA
INSULT MOM.

13:35.415 --> 13:38.118
TRY SAYING, "ELLEN CAN'T COOK.
ELLEN CAN'T COOK."

13:38.118 --> 13:40.190
ELLEN CAN'T COOK.
(squawk)
ELLEN CAN'T COOK.

13:40.190 --> 13:44.995
YOU'RE TELLING ME.
WHY DO YOU THINK I WAS SPRAYING
PERFUME IN THE BATHROOM?

13:51.862 --> 13:54.534
(high voice)
YOU CURED MY SHYNESS,
DR. JAMES! THANK YOU!

13:54.534 --> 13:57.107
(deep voice)
WELL, I AM A NOTED
CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST--

13:57.107 --> 13:58.368
DADDY?
YES!

13:58.368 --> 14:00.610
HEY, HI!
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH REBECCA?

14:00.610 --> 14:03.213
CHLOE, THIS IS FOR TYLER,
ISN'T IT?

14:03.213 --> 14:06.376
YOU'RE RIGHT. HE SAID
HE'D GIVE ME A DOLLAR.
I'M SORRY.

14:06.376 --> 14:09.079
BUT JUST BETWEEN US?

14:09.079 --> 14:11.621
I'M GONNA TELL YOU
WHAT I TOLD YOUR BROTHER:

14:11.621 --> 14:14.354
I CAN'T TALK ABOUT
MY PATIENTS' PROBLEMS.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.127
TOO BAD, 'CAUSE THEN
I'M GONNA HAVE TO TELL
EVERYBODY

14:17.127 --> 14:20.060
YOU WERE TALKING TO
A TOY SHEEP.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.092
AND I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
TELL EVERYBODY

14:22.092 --> 14:24.264
THAT YOU STILL WEAR PULL-UPS.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.366
WE COULD DO THIS ALL DAY.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.568
I'VE GOT PROOF.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.401
YOUR MOVE.

14:31.401 --> 14:35.205
NO TV FOR A WEEK.
YOUR MOVE.

14:35.205 --> 14:36.376
(crying )

14:36.376 --> 14:37.377
NOT WORKING.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.879
(crying stops)
FINE.

14:42.312 --> 14:46.016
(high voice)
BRILLIANT, DR. JAMES!
YOU OUTSMARTED A 6-YEAR-OLD!

14:46.016 --> 14:47.657
(normal voice)
ALMOST 7.

14:50.190 --> 14:51.321
ELLEN CAN'T COOK.

14:51.321 --> 14:52.522
(squawk)
ELLEN CAN'T COOK.

14:52.522 --> 14:54.264
MOM, THAT'S HORRIBLE!

14:54.264 --> 14:55.465
(squawk)
ELLEN SNORES.

14:55.465 --> 14:57.267
MOMMY, GET RID OF THIS BIRD.

14:57.267 --> 15:00.130
IT'S RUDE, AND I THINK
IT SPILLED YOUR PERFUME.

15:00.130 --> 15:02.432
ELLEN LAUGHS LIKE A DONKEY.

15:02.432 --> 15:05.675
(braying)
HA HA HA HA HA!

15:05.675 --> 15:08.178
I SEE WHAT
YOU KIDS ARE DOING.

15:08.178 --> 15:10.340
I AM NOT GETTING RID OF LUCY.
I LOVE THIS BIRD.

15:10.340 --> 15:13.643
SERIOUSLY, KIDS,
WAS THAT THE BEST PLAN
YOU COULD COME UP WITH?

15:13.643 --> 15:15.145
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

15:15.145 --> 15:17.387
YOU BROUGHT THAT
SCREECHING BEAST IN HERE.

15:17.387 --> 15:20.490
THEN YOU LET HER
GET A BIRD.

15:20.490 --> 15:24.524
EVERYBODY KNOWS
THAT LUCY JUST REPEATS WHAT
SHE'S HEARD AROUND THE HOUSE.

15:24.524 --> 15:28.398
(squawk)
BENNETT'S WORK
IS DERIVATIVE.
ELLEN!

15:28.398 --> 15:31.101
I WAS READING THE REVIEWS
OF YOUR LAST BOOK OUT LOUD.

15:31.101 --> 15:33.563
(squawk)
SAVE YOUR MONEY!

15:33.563 --> 15:36.706
MOM, DO YOU REALLY
LIKE THIS BIRD?

15:36.706 --> 15:40.340
YES! NOW COME ON, LUCY,
HELP ME WITH BREAKFAST.

15:40.340 --> 15:44.344
WE'LL MAKE EGGS FOR
EVERYONE ELSE, AND THE TIP
OF MY INDEX FINGER FOR YOU.

15:46.246 --> 15:49.549
WHY DID I HAVE TO MAKE
SUCH A BIG STAND ABOUT
BEING AN ANIMAL PERSON?

15:49.549 --> 15:52.652
NOW I'M STUCK WITH YOU,
YOU STUPID, AWFUL, WRETCHED...

15:52.652 --> 15:56.526
WHO'S MY SPECIAL LADY?

15:56.526 --> 15:59.259
YOU KNOW, HONEY,
I CAN'T SAY THAT
I'M CRAZY ABOUT THE BIRD,

15:59.259 --> 16:02.132
BUT I AM RELIEVED THAT
YOU'RE GETTING ALONG
WITH HER SO WELL.

16:02.132 --> 16:05.235
YOU KNOW, PEER REVIEWED STUDIES
SAY THAT PEOPLE WHO
DON'T LIKE ANIMALS

16:05.235 --> 16:07.197
CAN BE HEARTLESS
AND ANTISOCIAL

16:07.197 --> 16:09.969
WITH NO ABILITY TO BOND
WITH OTHER LIVING THINGS.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.302
WELL, THAT'S NOT ME!

16:12.302 --> 16:14.344
THIS BIRD AND I
ARE BESTIES!

16:14.344 --> 16:16.376
WELL, THAT'S GOOD,
BECAUSE DID YOU KNOW

16:16.376 --> 16:18.378
THEY COULD LIVE TO BE
70 YEARS OLD?

16:18.378 --> 16:21.351
I CERTAINLY DID NOT.

16:21.351 --> 16:23.653
(squawk)
SEVENTY YEARS.

16:23.653 --> 16:25.355
(squawky laughter)

16:25.355 --> 16:29.719
OH OH OH OH...

16:29.719 --> 16:32.592
HELLO? DR. BROOKS!

16:32.592 --> 16:35.265
YEAH, THANKS FOR CALLING ME BACK
ABOUT REBECCA.

16:35.265 --> 16:39.099
LISTEN, I'M A LITTLE STUCK
ON HER TREATMENT,
AND I COULD USE YOUR INPUT.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.031
UH-HUH.

16:41.031 --> 16:43.473
YES. COULD YOU HOLD ON
ONE SECOND, DOCTOR?

16:43.473 --> 16:47.237
I'VE BEEN PLAYING PHONE TAG
WITH THESE PEOPLE.
DO YOU MIND IF I TAKE IT?

16:47.237 --> 16:48.408
GREAT. ONE SECOND.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.510
( beep )
HELLO?

16:50.510 --> 16:53.113
YEAH, UH, LISTEN, ABOUT
THAT PARROT YOU SOLD US.

16:53.113 --> 16:56.746
SHE'S BECOME REALLY HOSTILE
AND AGGRESSIVE. DO YOU HAVE
ANY RECOMMENDATIONS?

16:56.746 --> 16:59.149
HOLD ON ONE SECOND.
I WANT TO WRITE THESE DOWN.

16:59.149 --> 17:02.552
"PUT GRAPES INTO HER MOUTH
DIRECTLY BY HAND."

17:02.552 --> 17:04.654
GOT IT.

17:04.654 --> 17:07.026
"MASSAGE THE BACK OF HER HEAD

17:07.026 --> 17:09.459
USING THUMB AND FOREFINGER."

17:09.459 --> 17:12.232
WOW, THAT'S, UH,
THAT'S VERY SPECIFIC.

17:12.232 --> 17:15.605
LET ME ASK YOU THIS:
WHAT IF SHE GETS AGITATED?

17:15.605 --> 17:17.307
REALLY? OKAY.

17:17.307 --> 17:20.340
"BLOW BRISKLY
INTO HER FACE."

17:21.441 --> 17:23.673
( school bell ringing )

17:23.673 --> 17:26.376
HEY, REBECCA.

17:26.376 --> 17:27.547
CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SEC?

17:27.547 --> 17:29.619
UH, WELL...
JUST ONE SECOND.

17:31.751 --> 17:33.483
WHAT--

17:33.483 --> 17:34.554
WHAT ARE YOU--
SHH!

17:34.554 --> 17:36.626
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

17:36.626 --> 17:39.129
PLEASE STOP.

17:39.129 --> 17:40.490
ARE YOU AGITATED?
YES.

17:40.490 --> 17:42.832
I CAN HELP WITH THAT.

17:42.832 --> 17:44.534
( blowing )

17:46.466 --> 17:47.837
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

17:47.837 --> 17:51.501
I'M SORRY. CLEARLY
I'VE GONE ABOUT THIS ALL WRONG.

17:51.501 --> 17:53.143
NOW OPEN UP.

18:02.582 --> 18:05.355
MOM? DO YOU HAVE THE BIRD?

18:05.355 --> 18:08.258
Ellen: NO, SHE'S STRETCHING
HER WINGS IN THE FAMILY ROOM.

18:08.258 --> 18:11.391
THE PATIO DOOR'S OPEN.
SHE'S GONE!

18:12.422 --> 18:14.564
OH, NO!

18:14.564 --> 18:17.297
LUCY'S ESCAPED?

18:17.297 --> 18:19.229
MOM, ARE YOU SMILING?
NO!

18:19.229 --> 18:21.501
NO. I'M JUST
TRYING TO BE STRONG.

18:21.501 --> 18:23.533
SHE'S GONE.
SHE'S REALLY GONE.

18:23.533 --> 18:25.305
SO STRONG.

18:25.305 --> 18:27.707
NOW THAT'S SHE'S GONE,
I FEEL KINDA GUILTY.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.579
SHE WASN'T REALLY THAT BAD.

18:29.579 --> 18:31.311
SHE WAS JUST
A CUTE LITTLE--

18:31.311 --> 18:33.413
YOU'RE KIDDING ME!

18:33.413 --> 18:37.147
COULDN'T SHE HAVE FLOWN INTO
A POWER CABLE OR SOMETHING?!

18:37.147 --> 18:38.418
SHH SHH!

18:38.418 --> 18:40.750
NOBODY MAKE ANY SUDDEN NOISES.

18:40.750 --> 18:43.653
WE DON'T WANT TO
SCARE HER AWAY.

18:43.653 --> 18:45.755
QUIET.

18:45.755 --> 18:47.457
QUIET...

18:48.828 --> 18:51.130
QUIET! QUIET!
NO ONE SCARE THE BIRD!!!

18:54.534 --> 18:57.367
I'M SORRY. I HATE THAT BIRD,
BENNETT. AND I TRIED.

18:57.367 --> 18:59.209
I TRIED EVERYTHING
THE PET STORE SAID.

18:59.209 --> 19:00.740
WITH THE GRAPES
AND THE BLOWING

19:00.740 --> 19:02.872
AND THE THUMB
AND FOREFINGER MASSAGE...

19:02.872 --> 19:05.545
THAT WAS FOR THE BIRD?

19:05.545 --> 19:08.718
EXCUSE ME, I GOTTA GO
STRAIGHTEN SOMETHING OUT.

19:08.718 --> 19:10.820
ELLEN, DID YOU LET HER OUT?

19:10.820 --> 19:12.322
NO.

19:12.322 --> 19:15.355
BUT I WAS GLAD
WHEN SHE WAS GONE.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.587
(crying) ANIMALS HATE ME!

19:17.587 --> 19:20.660
PEER REVIEWED STUDIES
SAY I'M HEARTLESS AND ANTISOCIAL

19:20.660 --> 19:24.664
WITH NO ABILITY TO BOND
WITH OTHER LIVING THINGS.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.596
Stan:
AW, LOOK AT THAT FACE.

19:26.596 --> 19:28.538
GOTTA DO MY DOG THING.

19:29.839 --> 19:32.542
AW!
MOM, SEE?

19:32.542 --> 19:33.843
STAN DOES LOVE YOU.

19:33.843 --> 19:35.575
HE KNOWS THAT
YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON.

19:35.575 --> 19:38.248
I AM. I AM A GOOD PERSON.

19:38.248 --> 19:39.579
THANKS, STAN.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.551
OH, WE MAY HAVE HAD
OUR DIFFERENCES,

19:41.551 --> 19:43.613
BUT YOU'RE STILL
PART OF MY PACK.

19:43.613 --> 19:46.586
AW. AND I'LL NEVER MAKE YOU
AN OUTDOOR DOG.

19:46.586 --> 19:48.588
I BET HE'LL NEVER
STEAL MY SLIPPERS AGAIN.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.960
HEY, DON'T GO READING
TOO MUCH INTO THIS.

19:50.960 --> 19:53.593
I'M THROWING YOU
A PITY LICK.

19:53.593 --> 19:55.595
BUT I DO WANT TO KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE HIDING
THOSE BUTTONS

19:55.595 --> 19:56.696
YOU TORE OFF MY COAT.

19:56.696 --> 19:57.867
NO, YOU DON'T.

19:59.929 --> 20:02.272
BUT WHAT'S GONNA
HAPPEN TO LUCY?

20:02.272 --> 20:04.904
THERE'S THAT LOVELY FLOCK
OF WILD PARROTS AT THE PARK

20:04.904 --> 20:07.337
THAT SHE'LL MAKE FRIENDS WITH--
OR EAT.

20:07.337 --> 20:08.978
EITHER WAY, SHE'LL BE FINE.

20:08.978 --> 20:11.481
SO, WHO OPENED
THE PATIO DOOR?

20:11.481 --> 20:12.942
I DIDN'T.
I DID NOT.

20:12.942 --> 20:15.585
I FANTASIZED ABOUT IT,
BUT I DIDN'T...

20:15.585 --> 20:16.746
STAN?

20:18.648 --> 20:20.650
IT DOESN'T MATTER
HOW THE BIRD GOT OUT.

20:20.650 --> 20:24.794
THE IMPORTANT THING IS, THAT
FLYING TECHNICOLOR RAT IS GONE.

20:24.794 --> 20:28.428
SO NOW THAT
WE HAVE AN EMPTY CAGE,
CAN I KEEP MY SQUAKE IN THERE?

20:28.428 --> 20:31.901
A SQUAKE? WHAT IS THAT,
A HALF-SQUIRREL,
HALF-SNAKE?

20:31.901 --> 20:34.934
NO. IT'S A HALF-SQUIRREL
ON A PIECE OF CAKE.

20:36.766 --> 20:38.368
HE'S IN THE FRIDGE.

20:38.368 --> 20:40.440
I THINK I ATE HIM.

20:42.812 --> 20:46.446
Stan: BENNETT WAS RIGHT--
HE DID EAT THE SQUAKE.

20:46.446 --> 20:47.917
AND LUCY ENDED UP OKAY.

20:47.917 --> 20:50.750
I WAS WALKING IN THE PARK,
AND SHE PAID ME A LITTLE VISIT.

20:53.583 --> 20:56.686
DARN THING SCARED
THE BUTTONS OUT OF ME.

21:02.732 --> 21:04.764
HEY.
THANKS FOR MEETING ME.

21:04.764 --> 21:08.698
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO...
FRUIT ME, ARE YOU?

21:08.698 --> 21:10.940
LOOK, I'M REALLY
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

21:10.940 --> 21:12.702
YOU ALSO BLEW IN MY FACE.

21:12.702 --> 21:16.606
I WAS TRYING TO GET TO KNOW YOU,
BUT YOU WERE SO HARD
TO APPROACH.

21:16.606 --> 21:19.709
SOME GUYS SAY YOU'RE STUCK UP,
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE.

21:19.709 --> 21:22.712
AND I'M NOT PERFECT.
I DO DUMB THINGS.

21:22.712 --> 21:24.784
SOMETIMES WITH FRUIT.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.756
YOU WANT TO GO OUT SOMETIME?

21:26.756 --> 21:30.860
FIRST OF ALL,
I'M NOT STUCK UP.
I'M JUST REALLY SHY.

21:30.860 --> 21:33.963
BUT I REALLY DO APPRECIATE
THAT YOU MADE AN EFFORT
TO GET TO KNOW ME.

21:33.963 --> 21:36.796
NO ONE DOES THAT.

21:36.796 --> 21:39.869
I'M JUST TRYING TO DECIDE
IF YOU'RE A NICE GUY
I SHOULD TAKE A CHANCE WITH

21:39.869 --> 21:41.971
OR IF THIS WHOLE THING
IS JUST WAY TOO WEIRD.

21:41.971 --> 21:44.434
MY VOTE IS FOR "NICE GUY."

21:44.434 --> 21:47.777
I WISH THERE WAS
A SIGN OR SOMETHING

21:47.777 --> 21:49.739
TO HELP ME DECIDE.

21:49.739 --> 21:52.842
(squawk)
TYLER'S A JERK.

21:52.842 --> 21:54.043
OKAY, THEN.

21:54.043 --> 21:55.745
W-WAIT!

21:55.745 --> 21:58.848
THAT--THAT'S JUST
ONE BIRD'S OPINION!

21:58.848 --> 22:00.720
(multiple birds):
TYLER'S A JERK! TYLER'S A JERK!

22:00.720 --> 22:03.793
TYLER'S A JERK!
TYLER'S A JERK!

22:03.793 --> 22:05.324
OH, COME ON!
