00:07.050 --> 00:08.486
- Previously on "Colony..."

00:13.665 --> 00:16.668
- A protocol for building a
model colony here in Seattle.

00:16.712 --> 00:20.107
No transitional authority
or IGA presence at all.

00:20.150 --> 00:22.326
- We are here tonight
to welcome

00:22.370 --> 00:24.676
our new local
community patrol captain,

00:24.720 --> 00:27.157
Roger Erikson.
- Thank you, Laura.

00:27.201 --> 00:29.377
It is an honor
to serve all of you,

00:29.420 --> 00:30.682
and ensure your safety.

00:30.726 --> 00:31.857
- Did they tell you
what bus you're in?

00:31.901 --> 00:34.077
- They said D.

00:34.121 --> 00:36.253
- I know I should let it go,
but I felt connected to them.

00:36.297 --> 00:37.515
And I wanna know
that they landed safely.

00:37.559 --> 00:39.169
- Of course they did.

00:39.213 --> 00:41.171
In one of
the public housing blocs.

00:45.393 --> 00:47.308
- I found a crashed crate
in the woods.

00:47.351 --> 00:49.440
I think they're dropping
those from planes.

00:49.484 --> 00:51.703
- Off duty.

00:51.747 --> 00:56.317
- Is that any way
to greet an old friend?

00:56.360 --> 00:59.189
You're a hard man to find,
Mr. Dalton.

03:40.611 --> 03:43.353
- Didn't exactly come
in through the main gate.

the door unlocked.

03:50.317 --> 03:52.710

- Better than what's outside,
that's for sure.

04:03.460 --> 04:06.376
It's just the LA Colony
in a shinier package.

04:06.420 --> 04:09.945
- I found some eyes-only
IGA documents in LA.

04:09.988 --> 04:12.382
Seattle's a critical asset.

04:12.426 --> 04:13.731

04:19.433 --> 04:20.738
But I've been
surveilling a target

04:20.782 --> 04:23.350

04:23.393 --> 04:25.090
I'm ready to approach him.

Meet my partner.

04:43.457 --> 04:46.764
Then we get to work.

04:46.808 --> 04:50.812

to bus loading zone.

04:50.855 --> 04:53.031
- And do you have any family
members living in Seattle?

04:53.075 --> 04:57.122
- Our nephew was attending
Washington when it happened.

04:57.166 --> 04:59.734
But, uh...

05:07.785 --> 05:09.613
- Ms. Dalton.

Ms. Dalton?

05:11.093 --> 05:12.660
- Thank you.

05:12.703 --> 05:15.097
That concludes
the first part of the exam.

05:27.718 --> 05:30.504
Got a minute?

05:32.375 --> 05:34.508
- I went to see the Winslows.

05:34.551 --> 05:36.988
And they weren't
at that apartment.

05:40.862 --> 05:42.472
- I don't know.
Maybe they weren't home.

05:42.516 --> 05:44.082
- No.
No one was there.

05:44.126 --> 05:45.736
The whole building was empty.

05:45.780 --> 05:48.609
Why would you go there?

05:48.652 --> 05:50.828
- Well, because I fought
for months to get the Winslows

05:50.872 --> 05:52.874
placed, and I wanted
to make sure they were okay.

05:52.917 --> 05:55.398
What
Where are we sending people?

05:55.442 --> 05:57.400
- There was a day not long ago
when it was you

05:57.444 --> 05:58.575
on the other side of that desk,

05:58.619 --> 06:00.011
just hoping for
a second chance.

06:00.055 --> 06:01.970
You would have done
anything to be here.

06:02.013 --> 06:05.147
To have a home, a job, a place
for your kids to go to school.

06:05.190 --> 06:06.844
- And I'm grateful
for all of that.

06:06.888 --> 06:09.107
- Then do your job.

06:13.634 --> 06:15.505
You have a lot of open cases.

06:15.549 --> 06:18.682
You should start clearing them.

06:51.106 --> 06:53.500
- Would you like
another cup of tea,

06:53.543 --> 06:55.632
Mr. Snyder?

06:55.676 --> 06:58.200
- I've had more tea
than the Queen.

06:58.243 --> 07:00.724
How much longer
is it going to be?

07:00.768 --> 07:03.074
- I'm sure it will
just be another second.

07:14.477 --> 07:16.697
He's ready for you now.

07:31.625 --> 07:34.105
- Alan Snyder.

Global Authority war hero.

07:36.804 --> 07:40.590
I, uh--
this is a privilege.

07:40.634 --> 07:42.592
- The privilege is all mine,
Mr. Kynes.

07:42.636 --> 07:44.202
I came to study
at the feet of the master.

07:44.246 --> 07:45.769
- You're looking
for a second career

07:45.813 --> 07:47.249
in information
technology?

07:47.292 --> 07:49.120
- I'm afraid my current
responsibilities occupy

07:49.164 --> 07:50.600
too much of my bandwidth
already.

07:50.644 --> 07:51.949
- I'm sure.

07:51.993 --> 07:53.211
- You're an attaché now.

07:53.255 --> 07:55.910
Or

07:55.953 --> 07:57.868
- I'm a man
in need of guidance.

07:57.912 --> 08:00.523
It's no secret that the IGA
is keen to replicate

08:00.567 --> 08:01.916
the success that
you've had in Seattle.

08:01.959 --> 08:03.265
As we speak,
Colonies all over the world

08:03.308 --> 08:04.875
are following
your lead.

08:04.919 --> 08:06.964
I've been personally
overseeing the implementation

08:07.008 --> 08:08.662
of your protocol in Los Angeles

08:08.705 --> 08:11.012
for the last six months.

08:11.055 --> 08:14.058
- With little success,
I'm hearing.

08:14.102 --> 08:16.626
- Los Angeles has been going
through some growing pains.

08:16.670 --> 08:18.889
But that's to be expected
when building out a franchise,

08:18.933 --> 08:20.282
isn't it?

08:20.325 --> 08:22.197
- Mm.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.807
What can I do for you?

08:23.851 --> 08:26.027
- Since there is no IGA
presence in your bloc,

08:26.070 --> 08:27.898
it's impossible to assess
exactly how you implemented

08:27.942 --> 08:29.596
your protocol here.

08:29.639 --> 08:32.773
As you know, there's a large
difference between theory

08:32.816 --> 08:34.339
and practice.

08:34.383 --> 08:36.559
- I have.

08:36.603 --> 08:37.691
Scrupulously.

08:37.734 --> 08:39.736
But I'm more of
a visual learner.

08:39.780 --> 08:41.651
- Oh, you came
for the grand tour.

08:41.695 --> 08:42.957
- I just want the other
Colonies to be

08:43.000 --> 08:43.958
as successful as Seattle.

08:44.001 --> 08:45.133
You know what they say,

08:45.176 --> 08:46.264
A rising tide lifts
all the boats.

08:46.308 --> 08:48.092
- I'm not much of a seaman,

08:48.136 --> 08:51.052
but don't they also say you
shouldn't build a new boat

08:51.095 --> 08:54.185
with old wood?

08:54.229 --> 08:57.319
- I've made
my share of mistakes.

08:57.362 --> 08:59.147
But I try to learn from them.

09:01.758 --> 09:04.369
- That's an admirable trait.

09:04.413 --> 09:07.024
Hey.
We're on the same side.

from Los Angeles.

09:57.118 --> 09:59.163
I've heard a lot about you.

10:01.775 --> 10:04.647
Amy was with a cell
in San Fernando.

10:04.691 --> 10:06.344

- Nice place.

10:15.484 --> 10:18.095
You must be useful to them.

10:18.139 --> 10:20.054
- I'm a doctor.

10:20.097 --> 10:21.359
Once they found that out,
they didn't ask

10:21.403 --> 10:23.797
a lot of follow-up questions.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.973
- Good story.

10:26.016 --> 10:28.671

We've seen to it that everyone

We promise the refugees

15:52.473 --> 15:56.172
People come here
because this is an oasis.

15:56.216 --> 15:59.436
- So the big secret
is positive press.

15:59.480 --> 16:04.224
Positive enough that people
overlook the fine print.

16:06.574 --> 16:09.272
We've remade Seattle
into the proverbial

of your intake,

That's our next stop.

16:40.042 --> 16:41.565
- Productive.

16:41.609 --> 16:43.132
We have enough
of the courier's routine

16:43.176 --> 16:45.265
to start
planning the op.

16:46.570 --> 16:50.096
- Will's Will.

16:50.139 --> 16:52.533
Something on your mind?

16:53.534 --> 16:55.057
- Look, I don't know the guy,

16:55.101 --> 16:58.147
but...I know the look.

16:58.191 --> 17:00.323
I've seen it in every hospital
I've worked in.

17:00.367 --> 17:01.542
Something bad happened
to your friend.

17:01.585 --> 17:04.197
He's not handling it well.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.590
- Seems fine to me.

17:06.634 --> 17:08.505
- Are you sure you wanna
bring him in on this?

17:08.549 --> 17:10.072
- Will's a good operator.

17:10.116 --> 17:12.205
He knows what he's doing.

17:14.468 --> 17:16.644
- All right.

17:16.687 --> 17:19.038
- When our tango makes
his last stop for the day,

17:19.081 --> 17:21.083
you and Will will be
waiting in the cab here.

17:21.127 --> 17:22.476
You'll tail him to the alley.

17:22.519 --> 17:24.391
I'll disable the vehicle,
then you'll use the cab

17:24.434 --> 17:26.262
to make sure
they can't reverse out.

17:26.306 --> 17:28.525
Will's gonna grab the target
while I handle the driver.

17:28.569 --> 17:30.353
You just need to get behind
the wheel of the cab

17:30.397 --> 17:32.312
and be ready to bug out.

17:32.355 --> 17:35.619
Whole thing should
take 30, 40 seconds.

17:35.663 --> 17:39.058
- Sounds easy.

17:42.800 --> 17:42.974
.

17:47.892 --> 17:50.417
Or like, ROTC or something?

17:50.460 --> 17:53.550
- Mm-mm,
just wanted a change of scene.

17:53.594 --> 17:56.771
My friend told me
the benefits are good.

17:56.814 --> 17:59.730
I just hope the physical
requirements aren't too tough.

17:59.774 --> 18:02.472
- Everyone, take
your seats, please.

18:02.516 --> 18:04.083
Thank you.

18:04.126 --> 18:05.823
I'm Captain Roger Erikson.

18:05.867 --> 18:07.738
Team Leader for
the Pioneer Square unit

18:07.782 --> 18:10.132
of the Seattle
Community Patrol.

18:10.176 --> 18:11.742
I'd like to start by thanking
you all for your choice

18:11.786 --> 18:12.830
to serve our city.

18:12.874 --> 18:14.528
Now, here in Seattle

18:14.571 --> 18:16.225
we do things
a little bit differently.

18:16.269 --> 18:17.922
We are peacekeepers.

18:17.966 --> 18:19.446
We are ambassadors.

18:19.489 --> 18:21.448
Being a part of the patrol
is not about

18:21.491 --> 18:23.014
policing your community,

18:23.058 --> 18:26.801
it's about
protecting your community.

18:26.844 --> 18:29.891
Any questions before we start?

18:29.934 --> 18:31.022
Sir.

18:33.068 --> 18:34.809
- Patrol schedules are
issued monthly.

18:34.852 --> 18:36.680
Any request to change your
schedule needs to be cleared

18:36.724 --> 18:39.596
by a supervising officer.

18:39.640 --> 18:41.032
Great, let's begin.

18:41.076 --> 18:43.861
You can open your
start pack to page one.

18:43.905 --> 18:45.167
Follow along.

18:45.211 --> 18:47.169

18:47.213 --> 18:49.563
Oh.

18:49.606 --> 18:51.565

18:51.608 --> 18:54.220
- Yeah.

18:54.263 --> 18:56.047
- Do you think
I'm gonna make the team?

18:56.091 --> 18:58.659
- I don't know.
How good are the other kids?

18:58.702 --> 19:00.182
- You're just
supposed to say yes.

19:00.226 --> 19:02.576
- Sorry.

19:02.619 --> 19:04.012
How'd you feel about

19:04.055 --> 19:06.710

for North Shore instead?

19:06.754 --> 19:09.670
- Well...

19:09.713 --> 19:11.150
I'd have to be going
to school up there.

19:11.193 --> 19:12.890
- Uh-huh.

19:15.197 --> 19:16.807
- I don't wanna switch schools.

19:16.851 --> 19:18.635
I started making friends.

19:18.679 --> 19:21.203
- Well, North Shore has
all kinds of cool programs.

19:21.247 --> 19:24.946
Advanced science, math,
computer tech.

19:27.122 --> 19:28.645
Look, you're really smart.

19:28.689 --> 19:30.560
And Seattle's a place where

19:30.604 --> 19:33.650
either you get on the right
track or you get left behind.

19:33.694 --> 19:37.001
I don't want you to end up
delivering groceries.

19:39.134 --> 19:41.789
- Maybe.

19:41.832 --> 19:44.313
Or I may get
an apartment up there.

19:45.880 --> 19:48.665
What girlfriend?

19:55.803 --> 19:59.154
I don't think
we can live together.

19:59.198 --> 20:02.679
Her father's pretty old school.
He'd probably murder me.

20:04.072 --> 20:06.030
- Meadow.

20:09.599 --> 20:11.340
- She's...

20:11.384 --> 20:13.255
normal.

20:14.778 --> 20:16.867
- I mean,
she's other things too.

20:16.911 --> 20:18.608
She's smart like you.

20:18.652 --> 20:20.784
Super funny.

20:20.828 --> 20:23.570
The best part about being
around her is

20:23.613 --> 20:27.704
it's easy to pretend all
the bad stuff never happened.

20:27.748 --> 20:30.272
She's just kind of normal.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.318
No.
