00:28.446 --> 00:30.615
Hey, get off. Get off.

00:31.783 --> 00:34.994
Hey! Hey! I said scoot, didn't I? Go.

00:45.380 --> 00:47.882
My goodness, you're adorable.

00:47.966 --> 00:50.343
- Is this the right place?
- Probably.

00:50.427 --> 00:52.470
My cat ran off. Dusty.

00:52.554 --> 00:54.055
He hasn't been back in five nights.

00:54.139 --> 00:56.766
Which is not like him, you know?
Not like him at all.

00:56.850 --> 00:58.059
Uncharacteristic.

00:58.143 --> 00:59.644
Very uncharacteristic.

01:00.895 --> 01:02.731
And I was told about a lady here.

01:02.814 --> 01:04.816
Might be able to help track him down for me?

01:07.861 --> 01:11.156
Madame L'Angelle
is a world-renowned spiritist,

01:11.781 --> 01:14.993
diviner, mistress of the pyramids.

01:17.537 --> 01:19.330
She sees through walls,

01:20.206 --> 01:21.875
round corners,

01:23.168 --> 01:24.961
into human hearts.

01:26.421 --> 01:27.797
She'll find your cat.

01:29.507 --> 01:30.884
I hope so.

01:30.967 --> 01:32.385
He's not an outdoor cat, you know?

01:32.469 --> 01:33.470
So, I'm worried that he might be...

01:33.553 --> 01:35.138
Parking is $8.

01:35.680 --> 01:36.931
Sorry. Right.

01:41.269 --> 01:42.979
You can park out by the slave quarters.

01:43.062 --> 01:45.607
Occult Room's in the big house.
Gator tours on the hour.

01:45.690 --> 01:47.525
Gift shop closes at 5:00.

01:48.443 --> 01:49.652
Welcome to Angelville.

01:51.946 --> 01:53.990
<i>If you've got the money</i>

01:54.574 --> 01:56.826
<i>I've got the time</i>

01:56.951 --> 01:58.620
<i>We'll go honky tonkin'</i>

01:58.703 --> 02:01.080
<i>And we'll have a time</i>

02:01.498 --> 02:03.625
<i>We'll make all the night spots</i>

02:03.708 --> 02:05.668
<i>Dance, drink beer and wine</i>

02:05.752 --> 02:08.338
<i>If you've got the money, honey</i>

02:08.546 --> 02:10.548
<i>I've got the time</i>

02:23.728 --> 02:25.021
<i>There ain't no use to tarry...</i>

02:25.104 --> 02:26.189
Welcome to Angelville,

02:26.272 --> 02:28.191
where the magic of the South comes to life.

02:28.274 --> 02:29.400
Spare me the carny talk.

02:30.610 --> 02:32.070
I'm here for the tombs.

02:32.862 --> 02:35.198
Tombs? I... I don't know what that is.

02:35.490 --> 02:36.908
Come on, little man.

02:38.326 --> 02:41.996
I got money. I wanna see some blood.

02:42.080 --> 02:43.456
I honestly don't know what...

02:44.249 --> 02:47.293
Maybe you should ask over
at the Boyd place across the way.

02:47.377 --> 02:51.130
They're into all sorts of shady stuff, Officer.

02:55.301 --> 02:57.053
L'Angelle scum.

03:00.223 --> 03:03.101
<i>If you've got the money, honey</i>

03:03.184 --> 03:05.186
<i>I've got the time</i>

03:36.467 --> 03:37.969
Hey, TC.

03:39.304 --> 03:40.638
Hey, Jody.

03:44.142 --> 03:45.393
What took you guys so long?

03:45.476 --> 03:47.896
I was halfway ready
to eat that stupid chicken.

03:51.232 --> 03:52.650
Anyway, thanks.

04:03.119 --> 04:05.038
Afternoon'll probably pick up.

04:10.501 --> 04:11.711
What?

04:12.629 --> 04:14.088
What? That's it. I swear.

04:51.709 --> 04:53.211
Son of a...

06:03.448 --> 06:05.616
Sorry to bother you, but...

06:13.666 --> 06:16.669
I don't know if you can, but please...

06:25.178 --> 06:26.888
Everything

06:26.971 --> 06:28.639
has a price.

06:32.518 --> 06:34.270
You understand?

07:39.043 --> 07:40.503
I'm sorry.

07:40.586 --> 07:41.879
No. I am sorry.

07:56.352 --> 07:58.354
They're assembling now, Messiah.

07:59.438 --> 08:00.857
Don't call me that.

08:01.607 --> 08:04.026
- I still don't understand what...
- We have to start somewhere.

08:04.110 --> 08:06.863
Build you up, introduce you to the world.

08:06.946 --> 08:07.989
And this?

08:08.072 --> 08:10.783
Your speech has been
focus-grouped multiple times.

08:10.867 --> 08:13.244
- I wrote the last draft myself.
- I can tell.

08:14.370 --> 08:16.455
I know messiahs.

08:16.539 --> 08:18.916
How they begin, how they rise.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.585
I know what makes them work.

08:20.960 --> 08:24.172
And this is how they start.

08:30.928 --> 08:31.888
A cape?

08:31.971 --> 08:36.601
An 11th century Flemish fencing cloak
with gold applique.

08:36.684 --> 08:39.437
You see? Gives a sense of authority.

08:44.650 --> 08:46.277
I don't give a shit.

08:48.112 --> 08:49.363
I'm not wearing that.

08:54.452 --> 08:56.412
Shall I save seats for your friends?

08:57.496 --> 08:58.706
They're not coming.

08:58.915 --> 08:59.916
Oh.

09:00.875 --> 09:03.502
Well, it's a packed house in there already.

09:10.218 --> 09:11.219
That is awesome!

09:11.844 --> 09:13.262
Quiet!

09:14.805 --> 09:15.806
Give me that.

09:20.811 --> 09:23.940
We have a special guest today.

09:24.023 --> 09:28.319
Someone who is apparently quite holy.

09:28.778 --> 09:33.658
And if you're good, he will perform,
or so I'm told,

09:34.492 --> 09:36.285
a miracle for us.

09:37.828 --> 09:39.413
- Is it God?
- No!

09:44.877 --> 09:46.545
But close.

09:48.005 --> 09:49.340
Preacher?

09:56.389 --> 09:57.682
Thanks.

09:59.350 --> 10:00.601
Hey.

10:02.520 --> 10:07.358
"Look around. The world has fallen
into confusion and decay.

10:08.067 --> 10:13.072
"Murder, rape, sedition, incest, lesbianism.

10:20.746 --> 10:22.373
"But I have a power...

10:23.374 --> 10:24.875
"A power to make things better.

10:25.376 --> 10:27.211
"Let me ask you a question.

10:27.295 --> 10:30.631
"If you had a power that could make
anyone do whatever you said,

10:31.340 --> 10:32.466
"what would you do with it?"

10:34.969 --> 10:36.470
Get my fart machine back!

10:36.554 --> 10:37.847
Quiet!

10:38.306 --> 10:41.142
You're never getting
that disgusting thing back. Ever.

10:41.225 --> 10:42.435
Ohhh.

10:44.312 --> 10:47.064
Hey, kids, you wanna see a miracle?

10:47.148 --> 10:48.941
Me!

10:56.198 --> 10:58.993
It's the Armenians!
The Armenians are coming!

11:00.411 --> 11:02.413
Everyone, get behind a table now!

11:02.496 --> 11:03.622
Get down!

11:05.166 --> 11:06.167
Come on!

11:09.628 --> 11:11.756
Let's go! Get down! Come on!

11:22.099 --> 11:23.684
Move aside, priest.

11:24.477 --> 11:26.812
We just want the nuns and the children.

11:27.188 --> 11:29.482
Idiots. Do you know who this man is?

11:30.775 --> 11:32.568
Put your weapons down.

11:39.075 --> 11:40.117
What did you say?

11:44.163 --> 11:45.331
Say that again.

11:49.293 --> 11:50.378
I said...

11:53.172 --> 11:54.507
Put your weapons down.

12:38.092 --> 12:39.677
<i>My sweet Lord</i>

12:41.637 --> 12:43.722
<i>Mmm, my Lord</i>

12:46.058 --> 12:48.269
<i>I really want to see you</i>

12:50.312 --> 12:52.523
<i>Really want to see you</i>

12:54.275 --> 12:56.402
<i>Really want to see you, Lord</i>

12:58.195 --> 13:00.197
<i>Really want to see you, Lord</i>

13:00.281 --> 13:03.033
<i>But it takes so long, My Lord</i>

13:03.367 --> 13:05.327
<i>Hallelujah</i>

13:05.411 --> 13:07.288
<i>My sweet Lord</i>

13:07.371 --> 13:09.248
<i>Hallelujah</i>

13:09.373 --> 13:11.250
<i>Mmm, my Lord</i>

13:11.542 --> 13:13.127
<i>Hallelujah</i>

13:13.210 --> 13:15.129
<i>My, my, my Lord</i>

13:15.212 --> 13:17.131
<i>Hallelujah</i>

13:17.631 --> 13:19.341
<i>I really want to know you</i>

13:19.425 --> 13:21.427
<i>Hallelujah</i>

13:21.510 --> 13:23.053
<i>Really want to go with you</i>

13:23.137 --> 13:25.097
<i>Hallelujah</i>

13:25.639 --> 13:28.058
<i>Really want to show you, Lord</i>

13:28.642 --> 13:31.312
<i>That it won't take long, My Lord</i>

13:31.395 --> 13:33.522
<i>Hallelujah</i>

13:33.606 --> 13:36.734
Preacher!
Preacher! Preacher! Preacher!

13:48.078 --> 13:51.332
Okay. I'm gonna see you all later.
You take care of yourselves now.

13:51.624 --> 13:54.293
Bye!

13:58.464 --> 13:59.465
Get it all?

13:59.548 --> 14:01.675
Every screaming child and heathen cry.

14:01.759 --> 14:04.094
- Already posted and trending.
- Ah!

14:04.595 --> 14:06.680
Got a call from Jimmy Kimmel's people.

14:06.764 --> 14:08.057
We're off to Los Angeles.

14:08.140 --> 14:09.391
It sort of worked out, then.

14:09.475 --> 14:14.730
Yes, minus the anxious pupil
who defecated on my shoe.

14:15.648 --> 14:17.691
Why were they shooting blanks?

14:17.775 --> 14:18.859
Who?

14:18.943 --> 14:20.486
The Armenians.

14:20.569 --> 14:22.530
They had no live rounds in their guns.

14:23.864 --> 14:26.992
Such an alien culture.
Who knows what they're thinking?

14:29.537 --> 14:33.374
It was a stunt. You set me up.

14:33.457 --> 14:37.044
There is no time for conventional methods.

14:37.127 --> 14:40.339
The Christ child,
unibrowed cretinism notwithstanding,

14:40.422 --> 14:42.424
is miles ahead of you in name recognition.

14:42.508 --> 14:44.009
We have to spread the word.

14:44.093 --> 14:49.807
And this, as I said, is how we start.

14:51.225 --> 14:54.979
Now, come on. The jet is waiting.

14:57.731 --> 14:59.275
I didn't sign up for this shit!

15:00.025 --> 15:02.653
Spoken like a true Messiah.

15:40.149 --> 15:41.775
Jimmy Kimmel, right?

15:41.859 --> 15:43.319
Yeah.

15:43.402 --> 15:47.615
Exciting. Starr's a genius.

15:47.698 --> 15:49.742
And now we're his right-hand men.

15:49.825 --> 15:52.244
Ready to serve him
no matter the cost or cause.

15:52.328 --> 15:54.079
Ready to face down any disbeliever

15:54.163 --> 15:56.915
who dares oppose him
and drench the streets in their blood.

15:58.292 --> 16:01.420
Yeah. No, I'm excited.

16:03.130 --> 16:06.008
I'm gonna unplug the air mattress.
Maybe take a shower.

17:47.651 --> 17:53.615
<i>Playing by day. Feeding by night.
We are the Children of Blood.</i>

17:53.699 --> 17:58.036
<i>Join us, and let
your darkest desires drink deep.</i>

19:17.407 --> 19:19.201
<i>I stand there</i>

19:19.660 --> 19:20.661
<i>Before you</i>

19:21.745 --> 19:24.248
<i>Afraid that I</i>

19:24.915 --> 19:26.667
<i>Have lost you</i>

19:26.750 --> 19:28.252
<i>To someone</i>

19:28.961 --> 19:29.962
Hey.

19:31.088 --> 19:32.172
Hello.

19:35.759 --> 19:38.095
<i>I can't believe</i>

19:40.722 --> 19:42.391
<i>That you...</i>

19:42.474 --> 19:43.892
All this for you?

19:45.018 --> 19:46.019
Hmm?

19:46.436 --> 19:47.771
Sunscreen.

19:50.148 --> 19:53.485
Some of it. Some of it's for a friend.

19:55.237 --> 19:58.782
I was gonna say. SPF 100?

20:00.117 --> 20:01.410
Gonna say what?

20:03.662 --> 20:05.205
No offense, ma'am.

20:08.166 --> 20:10.669
Well, that's for me to decide, isn't it?

20:28.020 --> 20:31.106
ID? For the booze.

20:33.025 --> 20:35.068
I don't ask, I don't stay in business.

20:53.837 --> 20:54.922
All right.

21:00.510 --> 21:02.346
Anything else, darlin'?

21:06.350 --> 21:07.517
Yeah.

21:08.894 --> 21:13.732
I would like some... Cherry lip balm.

21:16.652 --> 21:17.653
And this.

21:26.620 --> 21:27.621
Here.

21:33.543 --> 21:36.213
Yeah, 'cause I'm the bad guy!

21:40.884 --> 21:41.969
Bitch.

21:50.394 --> 21:51.561
You ready to go?

21:52.896 --> 21:54.064
Yep.

21:57.651 --> 21:58.819
Is that crack?

21:59.569 --> 22:02.197
No, it's just...

22:04.574 --> 22:06.118
It isn't.

22:06.201 --> 22:07.202
Seriously?

22:07.285 --> 22:09.746
Look, how I spend my downtime
is my business, all right?

22:09.830 --> 22:11.790
If you don't like it, you can clear off.

22:13.709 --> 22:16.461
In fact, you probably should
if you knew what was good for you.

22:16.962 --> 22:18.755
Cass, cut the crap.

22:24.761 --> 22:29.099
Look, Bimini is gonna be great. Okay?

22:30.058 --> 22:31.268
At least I think so.

22:32.477 --> 22:33.979
On the road again?

22:35.105 --> 22:37.774
No more dumbass God hunt?

22:39.484 --> 22:43.280
Just the two of us, partying and having fun?

22:44.072 --> 22:47.284
And Denis. Don't forget.

22:48.201 --> 22:50.162
Yeah, Denis, too.

22:51.621 --> 22:54.541
Anyway. Jesse's gone.

22:55.959 --> 22:58.587
He made his choice and we made ours.

22:59.629 --> 23:00.881
Too bad.

23:02.257 --> 23:07.471
But I am not gonna mope around
smoking crack about it.

23:08.013 --> 23:11.224
All right, but it's just... It's medicinal.

23:14.811 --> 23:18.315
So, look, whatever happens next,

23:18.398 --> 23:20.901
between the two of us, okay?

23:22.527 --> 23:24.404
I say let it happen.

23:25.155 --> 23:26.239
What?

23:28.075 --> 23:30.285
You know we're gonna have sex again, right?

23:32.162 --> 23:33.205
We are?

23:35.332 --> 23:37.751
Well, it's what you want, isn't it?

23:40.587 --> 23:41.755
Well, yeah. I mean...

23:45.217 --> 23:47.177
Okay. So...

23:47.886 --> 23:51.807
<i>If there's a Lord
Make her a woman</i>

23:54.017 --> 23:57.104
<i>Make she look after all...</i>

23:58.105 --> 23:59.106
Is that all?

24:04.361 --> 24:08.657
<i>May she forgive
All of those cowards</i>

24:10.784 --> 24:16.915
<i>Who make every day
A losing fight</i>

24:46.403 --> 24:47.529
You ready to go?

24:47.612 --> 24:48.738
Yeah.

24:53.034 --> 24:54.035
Is that crack?

24:56.538 --> 24:57.539
Yeah.

24:59.916 --> 25:01.293
All right.

25:04.087 --> 25:05.589
I'm gonna go pack.

25:09.926 --> 25:10.927
All right.

26:48.566 --> 26:49.567
That is the frontier.

26:55.198 --> 26:56.700
Who's that?

26:57.867 --> 27:00.495
He is the one who lets you out.

27:00.578 --> 27:03.248
Tell him your name
and that you do not belong here.

27:04.541 --> 27:08.420
He will blow his horn and see that
you cross safely to the other side.

27:09.254 --> 27:10.964
They will give you clothes,

27:11.047 --> 27:14.217
put you on a bus,
and drop you at the nearest stop.

27:15.593 --> 27:17.512
And then you are free.

27:21.433 --> 27:23.184
It's that easy?

27:24.060 --> 27:26.938
No, Eugene. It's impossible.

27:29.065 --> 27:30.984
Except for someone like you.

27:37.699 --> 27:39.200
Well, goodbye.

27:40.785 --> 27:42.329
You're going?

27:42.412 --> 27:44.456
Well, of course. It is the end of the road.

27:45.915 --> 27:48.460
What's going to happen to you?

27:49.753 --> 27:52.088
They're going to be mad when they find out.

27:53.423 --> 27:57.260
I suppose, but all they can do
is make it worse.

28:28.792 --> 28:29.793
Hello.

28:37.217 --> 28:39.427
My name is Eugene Root.

28:40.553 --> 28:42.389
I'm not supposed to be here.

28:49.270 --> 28:50.397
So...

28:52.857 --> 28:53.858
So uh...

28:54.234 --> 28:56.861
I'd like to get across and go home.

28:57.987 --> 29:00.073
Someone said that you could help me.

29:00.573 --> 29:03.034
Adolf Hitler did.

29:04.619 --> 29:06.162
He said that...

29:08.331 --> 29:09.833
He promised...

29:17.590 --> 29:19.259
Don't do that okay! I'm serious!

29:19.342 --> 29:20.677
I don't belong here!

29:21.302 --> 29:22.262
What!?

29:22.345 --> 29:23.346
No!!!

29:38.194 --> 29:39.195
Oh!

29:41.906 --> 29:43.491
Sorry.

29:48.413 --> 29:51.416
Looks like they were pretty rough
on you down there.

29:52.459 --> 29:54.210
Oh... No.

29:54.878 --> 29:55.879
This is...

29:56.546 --> 29:59.048
This is pre-existing.

30:00.216 --> 30:01.801
Oh, shit.

30:17.609 --> 30:19.736
I thought that was the horn.

30:20.195 --> 30:21.196
Which?

30:23.239 --> 30:24.240
The?

30:26.576 --> 30:27.785
Over there?

30:29.954 --> 30:31.372
Uh, no.

30:31.456 --> 30:33.875
No, that's just, uh...

30:34.834 --> 30:36.461
I don't know what that is.

30:39.589 --> 30:40.590
Here you go.

30:40.673 --> 30:41.966
Stop!

30:44.427 --> 30:46.095
Give him to me, Sharon.

30:48.806 --> 30:50.642
He doesn't belong here.

30:50.725 --> 30:51.768
I don't care.

30:52.435 --> 30:53.645
I want him back.

30:53.728 --> 30:56.272
Superintendent, this is my jurisdiction.

30:56.981 --> 30:59.567
- If I say that...
- He broke my extrapolator!

31:01.819 --> 31:06.241
If I say he's free to go, he's free.

31:07.784 --> 31:09.118
Those are the rules.

31:10.912 --> 31:13.831
I don't know if you heard, but God's gone.

31:19.963 --> 31:21.798
And the rules have changed.

31:23.007 --> 31:26.386
Got him. All units descend on Sector Four.

31:28.930 --> 31:32.767
For eons we've ruled here
and no one has ever escaped.

31:33.393 --> 31:34.477
Ever.

31:34.894 --> 31:36.896
Did you honestly think that I was gonna let...

31:40.400 --> 31:41.401
Hitler!

31:43.111 --> 31:44.862
Hurry! You have to go! Hurry!

31:45.196 --> 31:46.614
You saved me.

31:47.198 --> 31:48.491
Again.

31:52.912 --> 31:55.957
You have saved me. Don't you see?

31:56.499 --> 31:59.085
I finally did something good.

32:02.171 --> 32:03.214
Go! Go! Go!

32:16.728 --> 32:17.770
Come with me.

32:20.315 --> 32:21.441
But I couldn't!

32:23.109 --> 32:24.193
The things I have done...

32:25.194 --> 32:29.198
It's very nice of you, but I belong here.

32:33.828 --> 32:35.538
Not any more.

32:47.008 --> 32:48.301
Kimmel's people.

32:49.052 --> 32:52.138
They wanted to put you on after Kylie Jenner.

32:54.932 --> 32:57.935
Why didn't you use your power back there?

33:00.396 --> 33:01.689
I didn't need to.

33:06.194 --> 33:07.320
You will.

34:02.250 --> 34:03.251
Are you ready?

34:05.253 --> 34:06.629
I guess so.

34:07.922 --> 34:09.966
Can you tell your dad I'm packing up the car?

34:13.928 --> 34:16.639
Cass! I'm packing up the car!

34:17.390 --> 34:18.391
Okay!

34:44.584 --> 34:47.754
<i>Join us, and let
your darkest desires drink deep.</i>

34:47.837 --> 34:50.673
You can't wear that on the plane.
Get dressed.

34:56.137 --> 34:57.305
Tulip?

34:57.597 --> 34:58.598
Yep?

35:12.111 --> 35:13.112
What?

35:13.488 --> 35:17.533
They were watching us. This whole time.

35:17.867 --> 35:20.536
- Who?
- The men in white.

35:21.871 --> 35:22.872
Starr.

35:30.546 --> 35:31.589
Jesus.

35:33.090 --> 35:35.134
God, I might've masturbated in here.

35:39.096 --> 35:40.556
Yeah, me, too.

35:43.392 --> 35:44.685
Well, do you think we should tell Jesse?

35:44.769 --> 35:46.395
That we masturbated in the living room?

35:46.479 --> 35:48.689
No. Not about that.

35:49.065 --> 35:51.734
About them spyin' on us.
Gatherin' intelligence and the like.

35:52.068 --> 35:55.655
That bulbous one-eyed git
has been undermining us this whole time.

35:55.738 --> 35:57.657
I say we tell Jesse about it.

35:59.742 --> 36:01.828
What difference would it make, Cassidy?

36:02.578 --> 36:03.579
It worked.

36:05.081 --> 36:06.290
See you in the car.

36:15.091 --> 36:17.927
All right, buddy, come on. Let's go for a ride.

36:36.070 --> 36:37.655
Can you be a good lad?

36:40.157 --> 36:41.158
Promise me.

36:42.326 --> 36:43.578
Promise me you'll be good?

36:47.373 --> 36:48.708
All right.

36:58.175 --> 36:59.385
Yeah, all right, don't look at me like that.

36:59.468 --> 37:01.554
They were in the laundry, and I was just...

37:07.143 --> 37:08.477
Denis, put 'em down.

37:13.733 --> 37:14.817
Did you hear me?

37:18.195 --> 37:19.196
Denis, put 'em down.

37:25.494 --> 37:26.662
Just put 'em down.

37:27.830 --> 37:28.831
Put 'em down.

37:33.502 --> 37:34.754
Please.

37:36.130 --> 37:38.507
Can you be a good lad, Papa?

37:42.720 --> 37:43.930
Can you be good?

37:51.479 --> 37:52.521
No.

37:55.441 --> 37:57.193
I don't think I can.

38:00.821 --> 38:02.573
Not with you around.

38:09.997 --> 38:13.960
Papa! Papa! Papa!

38:14.043 --> 38:17.463
Papa! Papa! Papa!

38:18.839 --> 38:24.512
- Papa! Papa...
- I know. I know.

38:42.780 --> 38:44.448
I like your hoodie.

38:44.532 --> 38:45.533
Hmm?

38:47.034 --> 38:48.494
Your jacket.

38:48.995 --> 38:49.996
Oh, yeah.

38:51.747 --> 38:53.916
It's a little big, but...

38:56.752 --> 38:57.753
<i>Danke.</i>

39:17.690 --> 39:18.691
Well.

39:20.401 --> 39:22.445
My dad would probably get
a kick out of meeting you.

39:25.114 --> 39:26.991
He loves the History Channel.

39:31.954 --> 39:32.913
Now.

39:32.997 --> 39:35.291
You're welcome to come back home
with me if you want...

39:36.584 --> 39:37.585
Get out of the road!

39:40.171 --> 39:41.172
Shit!

39:44.842 --> 39:47.303
You okay? Come and help!

39:51.140 --> 39:52.391
Get out of my way!

39:58.564 --> 39:59.565
What's wrong with you?

40:04.320 --> 40:05.988
Shit.

40:15.331 --> 40:16.499
Hi.

40:20.586 --> 40:21.587
Ew!

40:26.884 --> 40:29.970
<i>There is a young cowboy</i>

40:31.347 --> 40:33.974
<i>He lives on the range</i>

40:35.434 --> 40:40.731
<i>His horse and his cattle
are his only companions</i>

40:42.900 --> 40:49.115
<i>He works in the saddle
He sleeps in the canyons</i>

40:50.741 --> 40:53.536
<i>Just waiting for summer</i>

40:54.870 --> 40:57.623
<i>His pastures to change</i>

41:02.253 --> 41:08.384
<i>And as the moon rises
He sits by the fire...</i>

41:25.359 --> 41:26.527
Where's Denis?

41:27.361 --> 41:30.447
Oh, he, uh... He changed his mind.

41:34.702 --> 41:36.579
Hey, you can sit in the front if you want.

41:40.082 --> 41:41.292
Oh, yeah.

41:57.224 --> 42:00.019
Yeah, this is a definite upgrade.

42:00.394 --> 42:04.273
It's got nice sightlines and handy ashtray.

42:05.191 --> 42:06.859
This is very nice.

42:10.196 --> 42:12.615
Will you give me a sec?
I forgot to say goodbye.

42:13.073 --> 42:14.074
Sure.

42:46.649 --> 42:47.650
Jenny?

42:49.568 --> 42:51.570
Tulip, is that you?

42:52.321 --> 42:54.198
Just give me a sec.

42:55.991 --> 42:57.076
Sure.

43:34.029 --> 43:35.281
You moving out?

43:35.739 --> 43:38.033
Yeah. Found a new place.

43:39.159 --> 43:40.494
Yeah.

43:42.037 --> 43:43.414
I'm moving, too.

43:45.040 --> 43:48.168
This was always gonna be temporary.

43:50.045 --> 43:51.255
Yeah.

43:57.094 --> 44:00.639
I just wanted to say thank you.

44:01.557 --> 44:04.768
You know, for everything.

44:06.020 --> 44:07.730
I should thank you.

44:08.397 --> 44:11.775
Well, you helped me get through
a bad stretch there.

44:13.277 --> 44:14.778
Showed me how to be strong.

44:16.113 --> 44:17.448
You're out of moisturizer.

44:25.039 --> 44:26.206
Bitch.

44:34.840 --> 44:36.717
'Course, I still have a ways to go.

44:38.469 --> 44:39.470
Hmm.

44:41.597 --> 44:44.433
I never did tell you about Dallas, did I?

44:46.894 --> 44:47.936
No.

44:48.604 --> 44:49.772
You never did.

45:02.618 --> 45:04.370
Preacher,
tell us about your special...

45:04.453 --> 45:06.038
Preacher, tell us about your special powers.

45:06.121 --> 45:07.706
Is it true you read a nun's mind?

45:07.790 --> 45:09.249
What's up with those shiny collar things?

45:09.500 --> 45:11.043
All right. That's enough.

45:11.502 --> 45:14.296
Tune in for more, tonight on <i>Kimmel.</i>

45:14.380 --> 45:15.589
- Preacher!
- Preacher!

45:32.856 --> 45:33.857
You're a natural.

45:34.983 --> 45:36.235
And when the world realizes

45:36.318 --> 45:38.570
that their only other option needs reminding

45:38.654 --> 45:41.281
he can't eat his own hemorrhoids,

45:41.782 --> 45:43.534
I think we'll be in good shape.

45:52.835 --> 45:56.255
Preacher. We're on our way to redemption.

45:57.423 --> 46:00.008
This is your calling, not that.

46:03.762 --> 46:05.639
I just wanna see they're okay.

46:11.520 --> 46:13.814
I understand. Go to your friends.

46:13.897 --> 46:15.983
- Get in there as fast as you can...
- Go!

46:16.066 --> 46:18.360
And when you're ready,
come back for your soul.

46:28.537 --> 46:29.955
Idiots.

46:30.831 --> 46:32.249
Shut up.

46:32.332 --> 46:33.917
I'll deal with you later.

46:35.043 --> 46:39.381
In the meantime, cancel the ambulance.

46:54.062 --> 46:56.398
She went upstairs to say goodbye.

46:56.482 --> 46:58.859
She just went up to say goodbye and I...
And that was it.

46:58.942 --> 47:00.611
It's all right. I'm gonna look at that.

47:02.362 --> 47:05.908
Okay. All right. Pass me those towels.

47:06.992 --> 47:08.660
All right, gotta keep the pressure on there.

47:08.744 --> 47:10.078
See if there's any super glue, would you?

47:10.162 --> 47:11.747
- Super glue?
- Yeah, to close up the wound.

47:11.830 --> 47:13.957
- Try under the sink.
- Okay, okay.

47:14.041 --> 47:15.042
God.

47:16.126 --> 47:18.253
I leave you for one day, look what happens.

47:19.880 --> 47:22.341
It's gone right through. That's good.

47:23.091 --> 47:25.219
What about window caulk? There's no glue.

47:26.094 --> 47:27.179
What? I don't know what to do!

47:27.262 --> 47:28.597
I rang the ambulance, like, forever ago, man!

47:28.680 --> 47:29.681
All right! All right, all right.

47:30.807 --> 47:32.976
Let's rig up an IV drip. You got syringes?

47:33.060 --> 47:34.353
- Yeah, I have. Yeah.
- All right, clean ones?

47:34.436 --> 47:35.521
And there's blood in the freezer, right?

47:35.604 --> 47:37.314
- Yeah, maybe some.
- All right, hurry up then.

47:37.689 --> 47:39.149
- She's AB-negative.
- All right.

47:39.900 --> 47:40.943
What happened?

47:41.026 --> 47:42.736
She just went upstairs to say goodbye and...

47:42.819 --> 47:44.196
- Goodbye to who?
- I don't know!

47:44.279 --> 47:45.572
I found her in the hallway.

47:45.656 --> 47:46.990
Christ, where's the bloody ambulance?

47:47.074 --> 47:49.368
Shit! I don't think I have any AB!

47:49.451 --> 47:52.204
All right. All right, Cass.
Let's drive her to the hospital.

47:52.287 --> 47:54.331
Give me a hand here. Come on.

47:54.998 --> 47:56.792
- Come on, that's it.
- Come on, come on, love.

47:57.292 --> 47:59.211
But... No, don't do that. That's all right.

47:59.294 --> 48:00.420
No...

48:02.172 --> 48:04.091
Come on, come on.

48:07.177 --> 48:10.389
- Come on, baby.
- Jesse, Jesse, Jesse, use the Word.

48:10.472 --> 48:12.641
Jesse, you're gonna have to use
the Word on her, mate!

48:12.975 --> 48:14.810
Just do it. Come on, do it.

48:18.188 --> 48:19.189
Breathe.

48:23.277 --> 48:24.278
Breathe.

48:25.862 --> 48:27.197
What's happening? Why isn't it working?

48:27.281 --> 48:28.574
- It doesn't work any more!
- Why not?

48:28.657 --> 48:31.243
I don't know, it just doesn't! Come on!

48:34.788 --> 48:36.290
All right, I can do it.

48:36.373 --> 48:37.541
- I can do it, I can do it.
- Come on!

48:37.624 --> 48:38.834
Move, I can help her!

48:41.670 --> 48:42.963
There is no other way.

48:48.677 --> 48:50.262
Don't touch her.

48:51.680 --> 48:53.390
Don't you ever touch her.

49:23.587 --> 49:25.631
Listen, listen. Listen to me, listen to me.

49:25.714 --> 49:27.132
You've gotta let me do it.
Look at me, look at me!

49:27.215 --> 49:30.052
You've gotta let me do it!
It's the only way, all right?

49:30.427 --> 49:32.888
Look at me, Jesse! Look, it's the only way!

49:44.858 --> 49:47.027
Wait, no! Cass, stop! Stop!

49:50.739 --> 49:52.949
Listen, it won't do...
It won't be, it won't be like Denis.

49:53.033 --> 49:54.493
- Cass, it's okay.
- It won't be like Denis!

49:54.576 --> 49:55.744
She's different!

49:55.827 --> 49:57.287
- It'll be different, I swear!
- Cass! Stop!

49:57.371 --> 49:58.497
Jesse!

49:59.665 --> 50:00.749
What are you doing?

50:01.708 --> 50:03.877
She's gonna die, man. Tulip's gonna die.

50:03.960 --> 50:05.295
Then let her die.

50:06.004 --> 50:07.172
What?

50:08.882 --> 50:11.843
Let her die. Let her die, Cass.

50:15.514 --> 50:18.475
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

50:19.184 --> 50:22.145
Just let her die. Let her die.

50:22.562 --> 50:24.106
Just let her die.

50:58.390 --> 51:00.434
<i>I'm just a poor boy</i>

51:00.726 --> 51:02.728
<i>From Nottingham</i>

51:03.186 --> 51:05.063
<i>I had my dreams</i>

51:05.605 --> 51:08.942
<i>But in this world
They're gone, they're gone</i>

51:10.360 --> 51:13.613
<i>Oh, I'm so lonesome on my one</i>

51:17.909 --> 51:19.244
There's something I wanna say.

51:24.833 --> 51:27.544
Something I've been meaning
to tell you for a long time.

51:35.135 --> 51:36.470
I hate you.

51:43.101 --> 51:44.728
You hate me now?

51:47.814 --> 51:49.691
Just you wait.

51:52.527 --> 51:54.237
Just you wait.

51:54.613 --> 51:57.532
<i>Where's God, where's God?</i>

51:57.991 --> 52:00.535
<i>He's even left me on my one</i>

52:09.795 --> 52:11.963
<i>I'm just a poor boy</i>

52:12.172 --> 52:14.007
<i>From Nottingham</i>

52:15.175 --> 52:16.968
<i>I had my dreams</i>

52:17.052 --> 52:21.014
<i>But in this world
They're gone, they're gone</i>

52:21.807 --> 52:24.851
<i>I'm oh-so-lonesome on my one</i>
