00:29.863 --> 00:31.599
It smells like a
Catholic church in here.

What are you doing?

00:33.534 --> 00:35.035
Meditating.

This might sound really
Western to me, but why?

00:39.340 --> 00:42.810
[inaudible] you're looking at
the books that Nancy left you,

00:42.843 --> 00:44.712
The Once and Future Goddess.

00:44.745 --> 00:45.979
Yeah.

00:46.013 --> 00:49.750
This is about if I want
to transform myself.

00:49.783 --> 00:52.320
I have to totally reconnect
with my own inner goddess.

00:52.353 --> 00:55.723
Mm, your inner goddess.

00:55.756 --> 00:57.925
Hinduism, The Art of Living.

00:57.958 --> 00:59.360
Well, see, yeah,
that's about how

00:59.393 --> 01:01.729
action sculptures your life.

01:01.762 --> 01:03.731
In other words, you can't
just sit there on your butt

01:03.764 --> 01:06.234
if you want your life
to turn into anything.

01:06.267 --> 01:08.836
Oh, well who would have
thought that common sense

01:08.869 --> 01:11.839
would have been so ancient?

01:11.872 --> 01:15.776
Yeah, and the Kabbalah,
it says that only 1% of us

01:15.809 --> 01:20.848
is physical, while 99%
of us is spiritual.

01:20.881 --> 01:25.519
Oh, so there's math involved.

01:25.553 --> 01:26.754
No, Jackie, come here.

01:26.787 --> 01:27.655
Sit down.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.157
I'll show you how to do it.

01:29.190 --> 01:30.658
It's just like, OK.

01:30.691 --> 01:32.326
You sit down, you kind of relax.

01:32.360 --> 01:34.528
You know, open up your
palms and everything.

01:34.562 --> 01:37.765
And you just kind of let all
your worries and everything go.

01:37.798 --> 01:40.734
You know, you just kind of
try to open yourself up so

01:40.768 --> 01:43.036
that you feel free, you know?

01:43.070 --> 01:47.341
And then try to take in just
a feeling of calm, a kind

01:47.375 --> 01:50.978
of personal power, you know?

01:51.011 --> 01:57.485
Concentrating on this great
feeling of inner peace.

01:57.518 --> 02:00.988
Um, before I forget, I ran
into Dan at the gas station.

02:01.021 --> 02:03.224
He said he was going to
drop by and pick up Jerry.

02:03.257 --> 02:05.559
That bastard!

02:05.593 --> 02:07.161
He's not even calling first?

02:07.195 --> 02:09.397
Like I'm just supposed
to sit here on my butt

02:09.430 --> 02:10.898
all my life waiting for him?

02:10.931 --> 02:12.833
Roseanne, calm down.

02:12.866 --> 02:14.335
I will certainly
not calm down.

02:14.368 --> 02:16.170
He can just go [bleep] himself.

If what doesn't kill
us is making us stronger,

02:26.113 --> 02:30.818
we're gonna last longer than
that greatest wall in China.

Oh, that rabbit with a drum.

If there's one thing that
I've learned while waiting

02:39.727 --> 02:44.031
for my turn it's that in
each lifetime a rain falls,

02:44.064 --> 02:47.201
but you also get some sun.

02:47.235 --> 02:51.839
And we'll make out
better than OK.

02:51.872 --> 02:53.841

Hey.

Hi.

03:19.800 --> 03:20.668
Roseanne around?

03:20.701 --> 03:21.669
No.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.237
David's still in
Chicago, so she drove

03:23.271 --> 03:24.505
Darlene to see the
doctor, because she

03:24.538 --> 03:26.073
wasn't feeling well.
- Everything OK?

03:26.106 --> 03:27.275
Oh, yeah.

03:27.308 --> 03:30.043
No, it's just indigestion
or something like that.

03:30.077 --> 03:32.079
Roseanne knew I was coming
to pick up Jerry, right?

03:32.112 --> 03:33.914
Actually, I think
that's the reason why she

03:33.947 --> 03:36.450
volunteered to drive Darlene.

03:36.484 --> 03:38.686
I could understand that.

03:38.719 --> 03:41.989
I'm not too crazy about
me these days either.

So how's it feel to be
a captain of industry?

03:57.871 --> 03:59.239
What?

03:59.273 --> 04:01.475
No, I heard about how you guys
bailed out the Wellman Plant.

No, now I'm reflecting on
all the mistakes you guys made

Look, uh, about what
happened in California--

Yeah, hit me with it, Dan.

07:47.367 --> 07:50.437
I'm numb from the cold.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.305
I was stupid.

insensitive, and self absorbed.

kind of a blanket stupid.

to me, and I fell for it.

did was talk about the weather.

It's weird out there.

08:18.298 --> 08:19.332

08:22.002 --> 08:23.837

the Santa Ana winds,

08:23.871 --> 08:26.206
and I don't know if they're
the same thing or not.

08:26.239 --> 08:28.041
But it makes it hot and
it's really uncomfortable.

08:28.075 --> 08:29.276

08:29.309 --> 08:31.912
So is this the kind of
thing that she listened to?

08:37.785 --> 08:40.453

close to making

08:40.487 --> 08:42.055
the biggest mistake of my life.

08:42.089 --> 08:43.123
Yeah, you were, Dan.

08:43.156 --> 08:44.024
I know.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.859
And I'm sorry I hurt you.

08:45.893 --> 08:46.760
That killed me.

I know.

08:48.495 --> 08:50.864
I'm sorry for it.

08:50.898 --> 08:52.099
I'd love to make up for it.

08:52.132 --> 08:55.969
I mean, I'll do
whatever you say.

08:56.003 --> 08:58.205
You just name it.

08:58.238 --> 09:01.341
Good, 'cause I got a
whole top 100 list I've been

09:01.374 --> 09:03.711

kind of start like this.

hugging me to keep warm.

09:13.787 --> 09:14.955
No.

But now that you mention
it, you want to go back in?

09:17.057 --> 09:20.093
No, it's too crowded in there.

09:20.127 --> 09:22.663
Oh, I got an idea.

ride up to Lanford Leap?

09:26.266 --> 09:28.301

incredible up there

09:28.335 --> 09:30.938
and that new car's
got heated seats.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.907

09:33.941 --> 09:35.008
Thank god.

through the change.

[country music playing]

09:52.726 --> 09:54.461
Wow.

09:54.494 --> 10:00.167
Well, so this is what's
become of Lanford Leap.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.802
I guess it's not a
make out spot once they

10:01.835 --> 10:05.338
turned it into a subdivision.

10:05.372 --> 10:08.241
Yeah, remember
right over there?

10:08.275 --> 10:11.311
Man, if that guy's
car park could talk.

10:11.344 --> 10:12.245
Yeah.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.313
I don't know if
I'd want to build

10:13.346 --> 10:14.614

a bunch of old beer

we used to come up here

10:22.389 --> 10:23.623
Oh, yeah.

10:23.657 --> 10:25.625
Yeah, I was gonna be an
all-pro defensive lineman

his own private make out spot.

what have you heard?

think I would have known it.

deal and that's it.

just a big rumor.

about how to structure

11:09.202 --> 11:12.539
the buyout and these pension
things and these tax deals.

11:12.572 --> 11:14.607
And the word debenture
kept coming up.

11:14.641 --> 11:17.444
This the kind of thing
you had to listen to?

11:17.477 --> 11:19.512
See, that's why
nothing developed.

11:19.546 --> 11:22.682
Because he expected
me to listen to him.

11:22.716 --> 11:26.987
- So you're available?
- Squire away.

11:33.660 --> 11:37.831
Would the lady came to
accompany me to yon boudoir?

11:37.865 --> 11:40.768
[phone ringing]

11:44.872 --> 11:46.907
Hope that's not the people
telling us to get away

11:46.940 --> 11:49.242
from the front of their house.

11:49.276 --> 11:50.210
Hello.

11:50.243 --> 11:51.111
What?

11:51.144 --> 11:53.046
No, slow down, Jackie.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.414
When?

11:54.447 --> 11:56.183
Yeah.
We'll be right there.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.218
Dan, they took Darlene
to the hospital.

11:58.251 --> 11:59.152
Let's go.

[country music playing]

12:14.667 --> 12:16.136
Uh huh, sure.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.438
Since when did you
start drinking coffee?

12:18.471 --> 12:19.840
Today, now.

12:19.873 --> 12:22.509
Well, now is as good
a time as any, I guess.

12:28.048 --> 12:29.883
Yeah, now I know what
all the fuss is about.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.021
Hi, what's going on?

12:34.054 --> 12:34.922
Is Darlene OK?

12:34.955 --> 12:36.223
Yeah, she's OK.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.591
She was in a little bit of
pain when we first got here.

12:38.625 --> 12:39.860
But she's better now.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.161
She's in with the doctor.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.495
So where's the kids?

12:42.529 --> 12:43.864
Where's David?

12:43.897 --> 12:46.533
Mom's got the kids at home
and David is still in Chicago.

12:46.566 --> 12:47.901
Did you call him?

12:47.935 --> 12:49.602
I tried to call him on both
those numbers that Darlene left

12:49.636 --> 12:50.570
and I can't get him.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.239
Why doesn't he have
a pop up pager.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.141
Well, I guess nothing was
supposed to happen by now.

12:54.174 --> 12:55.876
He was gonna get one
in a couple weeks.

12:55.909 --> 12:57.878
Did the doctor say
anything about the baby?

12:57.911 --> 12:58.812
No.

12:58.846 --> 12:59.746
Oh, man.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.114
Don't jump to
conclusions, Dan.

13:01.148 --> 13:02.782
We just don't know anything yet.

13:02.816 --> 13:04.217
Hello, I'm Doctor Rudmen.

13:04.251 --> 13:05.385
Are you Darlene's parents?

13:05.418 --> 13:06.820
Uh huh, what's going on?

13:06.854 --> 13:08.521
Well, your daughter
went into labor.

13:08.555 --> 13:11.191
But we've given her a drug to
try to stop the contractions.

13:11.224 --> 13:12.092
Labor?

13:12.125 --> 13:13.593
She's only seven
months pregnant.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.395
Well, that's way
too early to deliver.

13:15.428 --> 13:17.530
Well, that's why we're trying
to keep the baby in the womb

13:17.564 --> 13:18.665
as long as possible.

13:18.698 --> 13:20.300
But so far, she seems
to be responding

13:20.333 --> 13:21.768
well to the medication.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.570
What about the baby?

13:23.603 --> 13:25.805
Well, we have your daughter
hooked up to a fetal monitor

13:25.839 --> 13:27.607
and all the signs seem normal.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.276
Thank god.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.743
Yeah.

13:30.777 --> 13:32.712
How long before
they know anything?

13:32.745 --> 13:33.914
Well, we're gonna
have to keep her

13:33.947 --> 13:36.283
here overnight for observation.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.184
Don't be alarmed.

13:37.217 --> 13:38.886
This happens all the time, OK?

13:38.919 --> 13:40.420
She should be home
by tomorrow morning.

13:40.453 --> 13:42.422
Oh, good.

13:42.455 --> 13:44.657
OK, can we see her?

13:44.691 --> 13:46.960
Yeah, sure, but only for
a couple of minutes, OK?

13:46.994 --> 13:47.928
She needs the rest.

13:47.961 --> 13:48.761
This way.

13:52.299 --> 13:54.567
Come on, Deej.

13:54.601 --> 13:58.638
Let's enjoy that coffee.

[country music playing]

14:06.013 --> 14:08.415
Hey.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.483
Hey, how you doing?

14:10.517 --> 14:11.584
How's it look like I'm doing?

14:11.618 --> 14:13.586
What happened?

14:13.620 --> 14:14.988
I don't know.

14:15.022 --> 14:19.826
I just felt like I had the flu,
like kind of funky and tired.

14:19.859 --> 14:23.496
And then it just
kept getting worse.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.365
And then these
contractions started.

14:25.398 --> 14:26.967
Did you go into labor?

14:27.000 --> 14:29.002
No, I mean, they think
that it's like false labor.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.238
Anyway, they gave me drugs
to try and take care of it.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.273
And the doctor said
it's not too uncommon.

14:33.306 --> 14:36.209
Yeah, well you don't
even look bad at all to me.

14:36.243 --> 14:37.677
I don't know why they
even put you in here.

14:37.710 --> 14:41.048
It's just probably
some insurance scam.

14:41.081 --> 14:45.552
Yeah, you still look like my
little girl minus the attitude.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.420
But that'll come back
when the drugs wear off.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.259
You can save the
pep talk for when

14:52.292 --> 14:53.226
Jerry gets to little league.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.894
I mean, I know
what's going on here.

14:54.928 --> 14:56.696
Well, come on, darling.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.198
You're pregnant with a Conner.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.667
You didn't expect it to be a
typical pregnancy, did you?

15:00.700 --> 15:02.635
Yeah, Conner kids usually
wait till they're two or three

15:02.669 --> 15:03.770
to give you this much trouble.

15:03.803 --> 15:05.538
Your child is obviously gifted.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.710
I just hope the
baby's gonna be OK.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.012
Well, I know you're
scared, Darlene,

15:12.045 --> 15:15.615
but I'm sure everything's
gonna be just fine.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.017
Yeah, believe me.

15:17.050 --> 15:20.720
We're not gonna let anything
happen to you or the baby.

15:20.753 --> 15:21.989
I know.

15:22.022 --> 15:24.157
I just wish I didn't
have to be here.

15:24.191 --> 15:25.959
Well, we wish you didn't
have to be here, too.

15:25.993 --> 15:28.495
But, you know, pregnancy you
go through some tough times.

15:28.528 --> 15:32.932
And then in the end,
it's worth the trip.

15:32.966 --> 15:34.201
Yeah, right.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.036
You said the same thing
about driving to Gator World.

15:42.409 --> 15:45.645
Yeah, but you got a couple of
t-shirts and a hat out of that,

15:45.678 --> 15:48.315
right?

15:48.348 --> 15:51.251
I'm glad you guys are here.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.453
Oh, you know, I haven't had
any contractions in a while,

15:53.486 --> 15:57.490
so maybe I could try to get
some sleep or something.

15:57.524 --> 15:58.391
Oh, yeah.

15:58.425 --> 16:00.793
We'll be outside.

16:11.671 --> 16:15.008
[country music playing]

16:21.114 --> 16:22.549
How is she?

16:22.582 --> 16:23.816
She's looking good.

16:23.850 --> 16:26.653
She doesn't have any more
contractions for a while,

16:26.686 --> 16:28.021
so she's gonna get some sleep.

16:28.055 --> 16:29.356
Yeah, she's in good shape.

16:29.389 --> 16:30.957
I mean, she's got to stay
here overnight and everything,

16:30.990 --> 16:32.125
but she'll be fine.

16:32.159 --> 16:34.294
So she's definitely
coming home tomorrow?

16:34.327 --> 16:37.564
DJ, doctors never tell
you anything definitely.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.166
That's how they keep
from getting sued.

16:39.199 --> 16:40.400
Yeah.

So you're not gonna miss
any school on account of it.

16:44.037 --> 16:45.272

16:45.305 --> 16:46.173
Thanks, Jackie.

honey, I know it.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.747
Do you want to do a
crossword puzzle, Dan,

16:54.781 --> 16:57.250
because a nurse up on
three has got a whole bunch

16:57.284 --> 16:59.819
of them behind her desk there.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.988
No, thanks.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.724
So why don't you go up to
the candy machine on four?

17:04.757 --> 17:07.760
Because that's the only
one that they ever restock.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.862
Stay away from the one on two.

17:09.896 --> 17:13.466
They still got
Reggie bars up there.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.402
You really know this place.

17:15.435 --> 17:16.736
Well, did you forget?

17:16.769 --> 17:19.239
I was here 24 hours a day when
you had your heart attack.

17:19.272 --> 17:21.241
Yeah, I remember.

17:21.274 --> 17:22.342
Well, I sort of remember.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.315
Having a kid in
the hospital sure

17:28.348 --> 17:31.551
puts all your stupid little
problems in perspective.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.286
It really does.

17:33.320 --> 17:36.589
Like you know, I was
really upset with you

17:36.623 --> 17:41.128
about the whole nurse thing
there from the beginning.

17:41.161 --> 17:45.732
I want you to know that I
knew you'd be back, Dan.

17:45.765 --> 17:48.501
I'm not going anywhere.

17:48.535 --> 17:50.803
Good.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.972
What floor did you
say had the best candy?

17:53.005 --> 17:54.107
Four.

17:54.141 --> 17:55.508
Think I'll go up there
and see what they got.

17:55.542 --> 17:56.643
Why don't you
just go home, Dan?

17:56.676 --> 17:58.911
There's not much
you can do here now.

17:58.945 --> 18:01.348
It's late, you're tired.

18:01.381 --> 18:07.187
Now when you say
home, do you mean

18:07.220 --> 18:09.889
home or back to the hotel or?

18:09.922 --> 18:13.193
No, I mean home if
that's where you wanna go.

18:13.226 --> 18:15.695
Oh, of course that's
what I want if you want me.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.530
Yeah, I do want you, Dan.

18:17.564 --> 18:19.266
I love you, baby.

18:19.299 --> 18:22.135
I love you, too.

18:22.169 --> 18:23.903
Still not going home.

18:23.936 --> 18:26.105
Then you better go round
up enough candy for the both

Excuse me, Mr. and Mrs. Conner?

18:50.763 --> 18:52.165
How's Darlene?

18:52.199 --> 18:53.600
Can we take her home now?

18:53.633 --> 18:55.001
Actually, I'm afraid
the contractions

18:55.034 --> 18:56.669
have started again.
She's asking for you.

18:56.703 --> 18:58.705
Oh, god.

18:58.738 --> 18:59.539
OK.

19:06.045 --> 19:07.580
How you doing, sweetheart?

19:07.614 --> 19:09.882
Not so good.

19:09.916 --> 19:10.783
Where's David?

19:10.817 --> 19:11.784
I don't know.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.320
He was on his way
home from Chicago.

19:13.353 --> 19:14.887
Well, he probably
just got delayed.

19:14.921 --> 19:18.024
I heard on the radio there
was a big backup on the 290.

19:18.057 --> 19:19.226
Oh, man.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.560
Don't worry about it, honey.

19:20.593 --> 19:21.894
We're here for you.

19:21.928 --> 19:24.731
Isn't there something you
should be doing for her?

19:24.764 --> 19:28.034
Darlene, apparently
the magnesium

19:28.067 --> 19:31.204
sulfate that we gave you
earlier has stopped working.

19:31.238 --> 19:33.039
Now, there is another
drug that we could try,

19:33.072 --> 19:34.974
and it's called ritodrine.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.075
Well, so give it to her.

19:36.108 --> 19:36.976
What are you waiting for?

19:37.009 --> 19:38.378
Yeah, go.

19:38.411 --> 19:44.183
Well, this ritodrine can have
some very serious side effects.

19:44.217 --> 19:46.986
I want you to know if
you take this drug,

19:47.019 --> 19:48.788
we're going to have to put
you on a cardiac monitor,

19:48.821 --> 19:50.323
because it can disrupt
your heart rhythm

19:50.357 --> 19:51.958
and cause some chest pains.

19:51.991 --> 19:54.227
You could also have shortness
of breath, fluid in the lungs,

19:54.261 --> 19:55.328
and blood clotting.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.730
It could even affect
your blood cell count.

19:57.764 --> 20:00.132
Well, are there any
side effects for the baby?

20:00.166 --> 20:01.834
Unfortunately, yes.

20:01.868 --> 20:04.203
But considering the
alternative, I don't see how

20:04.237 --> 20:06.306
we have any real choice here.

20:06.339 --> 20:08.775
We will be monitoring the baby.

20:08.808 --> 20:10.343
Well, than let's do it.

20:10.377 --> 20:12.078
Darlene, don't you want
to wait and talk to David?

20:12.111 --> 20:14.113
Those are some pretty
serious side effects.

20:14.146 --> 20:15.181
I don't care.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.516
Unless one of the
side effects is death,

20:16.549 --> 20:18.685
then I'm taking this stuff.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.053
All I want to do
is save this baby.

20:21.087 --> 20:24.924
OK, then let's get started.

Hey, what if-- what
if this doesn't work?

20:29.929 --> 20:31.698
- Well, let's just hope it does.
- No, come on.

Just cut the crap here.
I just need to know.

the drug of last resort.

to have to deliver the baby.
