- Let's go.

02:43.040 --> 02:45.360
- Sure you do not want some?
- No. Thank you.

02:46.640 --> 02:49.080
It is delaying and
It's not like her.

02:49.080 --> 02:50.520
Maybe I barely know.

02:50.520 --> 02:53.040
I could say the same about you.

- That is?

02:59.360 --> 03:03.360
Yes, I bought three days ago.

03:03.360 --> 03:06.240
It is useless without the key and we do not.

03:06.240 --> 03:10.320
We acquired this
you also. Guess where?

03:15.360 --> 03:18.760
The light show you the way.

03:32.680 --> 03:35.240
Is that supposed to do something?

03:53.760 --> 03:55.040
The light of Naga.

03:55.040 --> 03:58.200
I'm feeling very attracted to you.

03:59.520 --> 04:01.440
The passage of Neira.

04:31.360 --> 04:34.080
It is far away, never make it.

04:38.360 --> 04:41.520
You have much to learn
of this business, Mai.

05:33.120 --> 05:35.800
There must be a passage
behind all that water.

05:38.840 --> 05:43.520
Oh, that will be fun for you
since I did the last time.

05:43.520 --> 05:46.800
I know, I know.

06:04.840 --> 06:06.200
Are you all right?

06:45.640 --> 06:47.600
Only a stake.

06:47.600 --> 06:50.160
- Moron.
- You scared us.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.840
- Ladies first.
- That gentleman.

07:10.960 --> 07:13.720
If you did not know better I'd say
you're flirting with Mai.

07:13.840 --> 07:16.200
I guess I know better.

less than what you thought.

07:47.960 --> 07:50.480

08:05.920 --> 08:10.400
- You know I do not like taking orders.
- That's exactly why I give.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.000
Are we done?

08:21.320 --> 08:24.400
Yes, we're done.

08:29.920 --> 08:31.560
I told you not to do them harm.

08:31.560 --> 08:34.080
What does it matter? Now
get what you wanted.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.440
What I have?

08:39.840 --> 08:44.800
Eight containers total

08:44.800 --> 08:48.200
So the needed alive.
To find the other.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.240
Who else knows what they?

08:51.240 --> 08:52.600
No one.

08:53.840 --> 08:57.240
Actually that might not be true.

10:07.480 --> 10:08.840
Hello?

10:13.320 --> 10:17.080
- What do you want?
- Know if they have leftover cheese.

10:18.360 --> 10:22.480
- Trip, what are you doing home?
- Looking for cheese.

10:22.480 --> 10:27.680
- Forget it.
- You ran away from school again?

10:27.680 --> 10:30.360
At first I do not call school
I call the jail.

10:30.360 --> 10:35.960
Emphasis in jail and second
I came because you told me, Mira.

10:36.080 --> 10:39.080
Come with me. Hugs and kisses.

10:40.480 --> 10:41.960
Why I wanted to see?
And when was the ...

10:41.960 --> 10:44.440
Last time I
gave you a kiss or a hug?

10:45.200 --> 10:47.760
Sorry, that came out more
evil of what I intended.

10:47.760 --> 10:51.080
Well, if you do not
sent, then who?

10:52.200 --> 10:55.480
- You did.
- What? Why would he do that?

10:55.480 --> 10:57.320
Because it's a trick
Classic to get rid of ...

10:57.320 --> 10:59.160
school, and the
Once convinced ...

10:59.160 --> 11:00.960

had a disease ...

11:00.960 --> 11:03.800
contagious and
you had to go home.

11:03.920 --> 11:07.920
Not my fault you did not know
what disease he spoke.

11:08.160 --> 11:11.960
I do not care. I'll take you
back to school tomorrow.

11:12.240 --> 11:14.400
Can not wait until
Monday? It's Thursday,

11:14.400 --> 11:18.080
perhaps we can have
well the weekend.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.640
Do you still plan to sail
Worldwide only?

11:32.640 --> 11:35.720

further delaying brethren.

11:35.720 --> 11:40.800
Be aware that if something
happens, I'll take your car.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.200
Paxton ¿Flynn?

11:54.200 --> 11:59.720
-Waters And Lahtasi. We are of the Interpol.
- Interpol?

12:01.680 --> 12:02.960
¿Disappeared?

12:02.960 --> 12:05.400
Just after robbing a museum.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.720
Our parents are researchers.

12:07.720 --> 12:09.880
Really? Do you think
your parents could ...

12:09.880 --> 12:12.320
pay for all this with
salary of researchers?

12:12.320 --> 12:14.640
I'm too young to
know the value of things.

12:14.640 --> 12:17.400
His parents are thieves
international.

12:17.400 --> 12:20.400
The interpol has the
been following for years.

12:20.720 --> 12:24.240
Have they ever told
on fragments lost?

12:24.240 --> 12:26.240
How porcelain?

12:26.240 --> 12:28.480
- No, a mirror.
- No, not me.

12:28.480 --> 12:32.040
- Are not thieves!
- I always knew you were hiding something.

12:32.040 --> 12:35.880
Mom and Dad? Does Dr..
Professor Dylan and hurting?

12:36.120 --> 12:37.880
Remember the golden cow
they brought Oreon?

12:37.880 --> 12:40.160
Yes and they returned to a museum.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.600
No, they did not. the
caught hiding ...

12:42.600 --> 12:44.240
in a secret room.

12:44.240 --> 12:47.760
And when they saw the trap,
Do you know what Mom said?

12:47.760 --> 12:49.400
I would not understand.

12:49.400 --> 12:52.720
- They sold.
- They must have had a reason.

12:52.720 --> 12:54.920
Trip, think, with all
this wealth, why ...

12:54.960 --> 12:57.600
think we had
in private boarding?

12:57.600 --> 13:01.160
It's hard being an international thief
if they have their children close.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.400
You're wrong and you know it.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.880
I'm right and we both know.

13:04.880 --> 13:09.440
Paxton, when you get away from mom
and dad, also you move away from me.

13:10.480 --> 13:15.160
- Are they good?
- Do not know.

13:15.200 --> 13:19.000
Hope you can help.

13:19.160 --> 13:21.840
You said something about a
secret room?

13:21.840 --> 13:24.680
What stole this time?

13:26.680 --> 13:30.320
A very old box.

13:30.360 --> 13:34.880
It was hidden in a secret cave,
but it was stolen from Tuli ...

13:34.880 --> 13:40.360
years and the government
To be returned.

13:42.280 --> 13:43.320
Do you mind if I see

13:43.320 --> 13:45.640
their IDs ... again?

13:45.640 --> 13:48.320
- Yup.
- Thank you.

13:53.120 --> 13:55.880
Lahtasi of Tubulú agent.

13:56.280 --> 13:58.160
Correct.

13:58.840 --> 14:02.440
¿Paxton you mind if I talk to you?

14:02.720 --> 14:04.600
About what? Privately.

14:04.600 --> 14:08.400
They can talk here.
Just trying to help.

14:08.560 --> 14:13.280
Yes I know. He is brother thing.
Girls, you know.

14:13.280 --> 14:14.080
Paxton right?

14:14.200 --> 14:15.280
That's enough, boy!

14:15.400 --> 14:18.000
Something tells me you are not
authentic official.

14:18.040 --> 14:19.760
How did you know they were lying?

14:19.760 --> 14:22.240
- Tunulú is not part of the interpol.
- Smart boy.

14:22.240 --> 14:23.960
Now, where are they
lost fragments?

14:23.960 --> 14:26.080
I know nothing, I swear.

14:26.080 --> 14:29.920
It is true, I know all
my life and never know anything.

14:29.960 --> 14:32.480
Let's see the secret room
from which both have spoken?

14:32.480 --> 14:34.440
Trip Run!

14:59.560 --> 15:01.800
Wait do not want ...

15:06.400 --> 15:08.040
I shot you with your own crossbow.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.680
Watch out!

15:11.200 --> 15:12.960
- Same here.
- Dylan?

15:12.960 --> 15:14.880
- Pax.
- Do they know?

15:14.880 --> 15:16.960
Move over, let's go!

15:16.960 --> 15:17.920
Well done.

15:17.920 --> 15:20.280
I did not shoot a
stranger with a crossbow.

15:20.800 --> 15:22.160
I have.

15:24.840 --> 15:25.840
Where'd you learn to dance like that?

15:25.840 --> 15:27.400
Remember all
those kinds of Karate ...

15:27.400 --> 15:28.720
to what Dad
and Mom made ??me go?

15:28.720 --> 15:30.560
Where did you learn to move like that?

15:31.040 --> 15:34.120
Remember Gymnastics classes
Mom made ??me take?

15:36.640 --> 15:37.920
Who were they?

15:37.920 --> 15:40.160
Becoming hired murderers
Interpol agents go through.

15:40.160 --> 15:42.360
Do not worry, I took care of them.

15:42.360 --> 15:44.960
My name is Flynn, Flynn Trip.

15:45.520 --> 15:49.120
Wait, how is that known?

15:49.160 --> 15:52.520
- We were at Queen together.

15:52.520 --> 15:55.520
Did not you say you went
a girl named Dylan?

15:55.520 --> 15:57.840
How partner?

15:57.840 --> 16:00.920
- Only a few times.
- Too.

16:00.920 --> 16:03.680
- I assume that your relationship did not prosper.
- No.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.240
And what do you do here?

16:06.240 --> 16:08.960
- It's complicated.
- That's a lie.

16:08.960 --> 16:10.400
- Trip.
- I'm sorry.

16:10.520 --> 16:13.160
I'm here because your
parents are trapped.

16:13.160 --> 16:15.560
For stealing artifacts fantasy?

16:15.560 --> 16:17.840
Mom and Dad are not
thieves, right?

16:17.840 --> 16:20.720
- Technically is not it?
- Are not thieves?

16:20.720 --> 16:23.520
Technically it does not
true, either.

16:23.520 --> 16:26.160
Go in and explain everything.

16:26.880 --> 16:28.240
Come on!

16:43.080 --> 16:44.360
Trip! Stop cleaning.

16:44.360 --> 16:46.280
I'm sorry. Clean makes me feel better.

16:49.640 --> 16:52.120
Any old society
hunters call?

16:52.120 --> 16:53.320
That's it.

16:53.320 --> 16:55.960
A group of scientists found
objects fairy tales.

16:55.960 --> 16:58.840
- I told you it was complicated.
- It's not complicated.

16:58.840 --> 17:00.720
- This is insane.
- A little great.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.240
It's simple, Hunters
found, acquire,

17:03.240 --> 17:05.400
conceal and protect
legendary items.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.240
If these items fall
in the wrong hands,

17:07.240 --> 17:09.000
endanger everyone.

17:09.280 --> 17:12.160
Aladin's lamp, the
Golden Fleece of the Argonauts.

17:12.160 --> 17:14.119
- Pure tales.
- All very real.

17:14.119 --> 17:18.079
All very dangerous and all maintained
safe from evil by your parents.

17:18.079 --> 17:20.319
It's what the hunters.

17:21.520 --> 17:23.160
I believe you.

17:24.079 --> 17:28.640
This is ridiculous! You know all this
only work with mom and dad.

17:28.640 --> 17:30.320
I know, because I am a hunter.

17:30.320 --> 17:32.520
So were my mother and father.

17:32.520 --> 17:35.480
Wait, does that mean that also
We are hunters?

17:35.480 --> 17:37.400
And we teach the greeting
hands secret? Say yes.

17:37.400 --> 17:40.000
I'm the only sane one here.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Before they left, your
father told me if ...

17:42.000 --> 17:44.400
no they contacted in
certain time, give you this.

17:45.240 --> 17:46.920
Thanks anyway.

17:47.600 --> 17:50.000
I have one. It does not work.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.680
It never made??, like
my relationship with my parents.

17:55.160 --> 17:56.760
This also serves.

17:57.360 --> 17:59.600
Have we got the same broken watches?

17:59.680 --> 18:02.160
- What time mark yours?
- 1:33

18:02.160 --> 18:04.560
- Is yours?
- 8:47.

18:04.560 --> 18:08.160
Why I have not watch?A message
text, I have a text message!

18:08.160 --> 18:09.760
We recently integrated into network.

18:11.840 --> 18:15.760
- What have you done recently?
- Untouched exceeds shadowy.

18:16.560 --> 18:18.920
Come to me. Hugs and kisses.

18:18.920 --> 18:22.400
Did you send a message to your
brother sending him hugs and kisses.

18:22.600 --> 18:25.560
- How nice.
- I did not send it.

18:28.920 --> 18:30.400
It's Mom and Dad.

18:30.400 --> 18:34.040
Must be a pre programmed message
to be sent if lost.

18:34.040 --> 18:36.560
- A pre programmed message.
- Yup.

18:36.560 --> 18:38.840
It's okay. And what does it mean?

18:41.680 --> 18:45.320
I think I know. "Come
my kisses and hugs. (XO, XO) "

18:45.400 --> 18:49.920
Mom and Dad and showed me this
pattern in this table is x and o.

19:13.160 --> 19:15.320
Come into my secret room.

19:29.280 --> 19:31.040
What is that?

19:39.080 --> 19:40.400
I peak.

19:48.400 --> 19:50.240
It is a code.

19:53.680 --> 19:57.120
One, thirty three.

20:00.800 --> 20:04.040
Eight forty-seven.

20:14.160 --> 20:15.760
Welcome to your lair.

20:19.840 --> 20:22.160
My parents always spoke of a
place called the "den," where ...

20:22.160 --> 20:25.320
made their investigations. always
I assumed he was in college.

20:29.400 --> 20:30.680
This is great.

20:30.680 --> 20:35.360
It is the symbol of the hunters.
Still do not believe it, right?

20:36.240 --> 20:39.320
Your parents are not only
hunters. They are two of the best.

20:42.600 --> 20:46.480
- How many hunters are there?
- No one knows for sure.

20:46.480 --> 20:48.280
To stay safe.

20:48.280 --> 20:51.160
Some hunters know
others, but not all.

20:51.160 --> 20:53.760
And I have to believe you because ...?

20:53.760 --> 20:56.520
On Razar, welcome Paxton Flynn.

20:56.520 --> 21:01.240
- What did Pax?
- Welcome Trip Flynn.

21:01.240 --> 21:04.160
Your parents must be scheduled at
computers to recognize their voices.

21:04.160 --> 21:06.520
When both are
hunters return.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.160
What makes you think
I want to be a hunter?

21:09.680 --> 21:13.080
I think not. the main
quality of a hunter ...

21:13.080 --> 21:16.520
It is the heart and
frankly do not have.

21:17.520 --> 21:21.160
- Have heart. I am wholeheartedly.
- You're not just words.

21:21.160 --> 21:25.560
I think even still
obsessed with me.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.560
If you want to obsessed
say completely ...

21:30.560 --> 21:33.400
disgusted, so if
I'm still obsessed with you.

21:33.400 --> 21:37.920
Guys, please, do not even know
where our parents are.

21:37.920 --> 21:42.120
Trip is right. See? Heart.

21:43.920 --> 21:46.160
Maybe the computer
know where they are.

21:46.160 --> 21:49.320
Computer, where are my parents?

21:49.320 --> 21:53.640
<i> Hunters Jordyn Carter and Flynn are
missing in action during a mission. </ i></i>

21:53.640 --> 21:56.520
Last location
known. Kensobra, Kai.

21:56.520 --> 21:58.680
What exactly was recovering?

21:58.680 --> 22:00.920
Four fragments of mirror.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.880
Fake cops
spoke of a mirror.

22:06.200 --> 22:09.200
Computer, what is so
important on the mirror?

22:10.200 --> 22:12.680
Properties mirror unknown.

22:13.800 --> 22:17.400
You know what I think? that
we call Mason.

22:17.400 --> 22:21.440
- Who is Mason?
- Look, you do not know something.

22:21.760 --> 22:25.880
Basically it is the oldest friend
my parents. Maybe he knows where they are.

22:25.880 --> 22:27.160
What we do.

22:27.160 --> 22:30.000
Hey, Mason, my parents
have you heard some ...

22:30.000 --> 22:33.120
a secret organization
warriors scientists?

22:33.120 --> 22:34.640
No? Thanks anyway.

22:34.640 --> 22:38.080
But still it is very rich. the
Rich people have planes ...

22:38.080 --> 22:40.920
and connections and
maybe he knows to do.

22:40.920 --> 22:43.400
Yeah, maybe, but I do not trust him.

22:43.400 --> 22:46.040
Not that I do not trust
it. Do not trust anyone.

22:46.040 --> 22:49.400
I do not trust him because
He is a friend of my parents.

22:49.440 --> 22:52.200
Do you still believe you still
hunters?Please!

22:53.000 --> 22:55.160
Here I have another test.

23:07.240 --> 23:09.960
- How long were dating?
- We were not dating.

23:09.960 --> 23:12.320
Mom and Dad thought we liked each other
so we went out a few times.

23:12.320 --> 23:15.240
Mom and Dad
they together? Because it pleases me.

23:18.040 --> 23:20.080
This car is not for three people.

23:20.080 --> 23:22.280
These cars are designed
only one person.

23:22.280 --> 23:24.080
But they are great Trip.

23:25.840 --> 23:28.040
- Comfortable.
- Do you like walking?

23:28.040 --> 23:30.280
We should return to the
hunting. Force them to ...

23:30.280 --> 23:32.600
tell us where
are the other fragments.

23:32.600 --> 23:35.600
Yes, because that will
worked well before.

23:35.600 --> 23:37.160
Yes, but now ...

23:37.160 --> 23:39.840
Do not hurt yourself, Vicky.

23:39.840 --> 23:44.000
Also I do not think these kids
know where the pieces are.

23:46.080 --> 23:48.760
Let them go. we will guide
if someone knows.

23:58.080 --> 24:01.760
Just a little warning,
Dr. Kramer is a bit eccentric.

24:06.920 --> 24:08.600
¿Dr. Kramer?

24:18.600 --> 24:20.000
¿Dr. Kramer?

24:23.960 --> 24:26.040
- Spe-?
- A decoy?

24:26.040 --> 24:29.720
Yes it is a decoy! Hi, Dylan.

24:29.720 --> 24:31.800
- Hello, doctor.
- Who are your young friends?

24:31.800 --> 24:34.440
- Oh, are the Flynns, Paxton and Trip.
- Of course!

24:34.440 --> 24:35.720
Children of Carter and Jordyn!

24:35.720 --> 24:38.640
- Go have grown!
- We have seen before?

24:38.640 --> 24:42.040
No, never, only noted
a biological factor.

24:42.040 --> 24:45.840
- I assumed by his physique.
- A little eccentric?

24:45.840 --> 24:48.040
- We need your help.
- Yes I know.

24:48.040 --> 24:51.400
Jordyn Carter and went after the
fragments and are now lost.

24:52.320 --> 24:55.240
Okay, just because a
mad professor, no offense,

24:55.240 --> 24:57.680
knows the same story,
does not make it.

24:57.680 --> 24:58.760
So know about the mirror?

24:58.760 --> 25:01.360
Yeah, you know the story
Mirror Snow White?

25:01.360 --> 25:05.040
Yes, there was some
evil genius inside.

25:05.080 --> 25:08.000
Yeah, that's one of the legends, yes

25:08.000 --> 25:11.720
The mirror has hovered
around for generations.

25:11.720 --> 25:13.480
Usually containing secrets.

25:13.480 --> 25:16.080
Oh yes, here it is!

25:16.400 --> 25:20.160
Now. hundreds of
years, an evil army

25:20.160 --> 25:23.320
The Krugen called,
he found the mirror.

25:23.320 --> 25:24.760
Do Kruegen?

25:24.760 --> 25:26.160
Yes, it is a name
terrible, I agree.

25:26.160 --> 25:29.240
They would have given it a name
much better as the ...

25:29.240 --> 25:32.800
Volgasi or league
contagious or spawn ...

25:32.800 --> 25:35.040
- Dr. Kramer.
- Oh, right!

25:35.040 --> 25:38.840
Well, the league Kruguen
use the mirror and the result ...

25:38.840 --> 25:42.200
it is something that we come to
known as the Dark Ages.

25:42.200 --> 25:44.320
So for
the mirror is used?

25:44.320 --> 25:48.000
When you look grants
your deepest desire.

25:48.000 --> 25:52.000
And all those who wish
want to look in this mirror is power.

25:52.000 --> 25:56.160
Are you listening
how does this sound crazy?

25:56.240 --> 25:58.120
Pax, we live in a house,
a laboratory ...

25:58.120 --> 25:59.480
filled secret artifacts ...

25:59.480 --> 26:02.040
and a talking computer,
How can you not believe this?

26:02.080 --> 26:04.440
- That's what's crazy.
- I like this young man.

26:04.440 --> 26:05.800
You do not.

26:05.840 --> 26:07.120
So the mirror is broken?

26:07.120 --> 26:10.160
Well ... Come close
guys, it's tea time.

26:13.120 --> 26:15.720
In the thirteenth century a group
gentleman known ...

26:15.720 --> 26:18.640
as Hunters
attempted to destroy the mirror.

26:18.640 --> 26:21.720
Countered evil in the mirror.

26:22.520 --> 26:25.520
The best thing the hunters managed
is break it into four pieces.

26:25.520 --> 26:28.320
Now four of the Hunters
They took a fragment, the hid ...

26:28.320 --> 26:31.240
in separate containers and
led in different directions.

26:31.240 --> 26:35.040
A fifth Hunter took the mirror itself and
all have been hidden since.

26:35.040 --> 26:37.360
So why
our parents want?

26:37.360 --> 26:40.160
Well, it is said that
Kruger are strong ...

26:40.160 --> 26:42.600
and again wish
gather the mirror.

26:42.600 --> 26:46.200
Fake policemen interpol
seeking three fragments 4.

26:46.200 --> 26:48.600
This means that
Krugen already have one.

26:48.600 --> 26:52.200
It is your destiny!you guys
must stop the Krugen!

26:52.200 --> 26:55.720
Do not! we have to
find Mom and Dad.

26:58.080 --> 27:01.320
And then we can recover the
fragments and arrest Krugen.

27:01.320 --> 27:03.600
The order in which to do so is
your choice, of course.

27:03.600 --> 27:05.880
Dr. Kramer, you know where they are
the other fragments?

27:13.080 --> 27:14.360
One.

27:14.360 --> 27:16.240
He has been keeping a fragment.

27:18.040 --> 27:20.600
We are all more than packaging
dear boy.

27:21.320 --> 27:23.080
How do we find the others?

27:23.080 --> 27:24.480
We are stuck. But I think
what we have here ...

27:24.760 --> 27:29.400
This is a very special glass.

27:29.400 --> 27:31.560
I think it may be
particularly helpful ...

27:35.040 --> 27:39.400
Well ... Tell me, who is
the leader of the Krugen ?!

27:46.920 --> 27:48.880
You must go and find the other
before the Krugen fragments.

27:48.880 --> 27:51.680
- We will not let them.
- Come on, I can handle this.

27:51.880 --> 27:53.880
Well, we gotta go, we go.

28:13.640 --> 28:15.520
Carter responds.

28:37.640 --> 28:38.600
This is the plan.

28:38.600 --> 28:40.520
Find My
parents, save the world.

28:40.520 --> 28:42.600
Saving the world and then
find your parents,

28:42.600 --> 28:44.280
if we do it the other way will be too late.

28:44.280 --> 28:46.840
- Do not you hear anything?
- No.

28:49.400 --> 28:51.080
This thing is vibrating.

28:51.680 --> 28:53.080
- I do not hear anything.
- Me neither.

28:53.080 --> 28:55.480
- Because they are old.
- Excuse me?

28:55.480 --> 28:58.240
Old, old, old, old only.

28:58.240 --> 29:01.840
The younger you are more frequencies
you can hear, it just is.

29:01.840 --> 29:03.040
- So what?
- Well, that ...

29:03.040 --> 29:05.040
Remember what Kramer said,
said that we could find ...

29:05.040 --> 29:07.000
the other fragments if
believed in what we heard.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.480
I'm telling you I
hearing this vibrating thing.

29:16.520 --> 29:19.520
- What are those numbers?
- The frequency of vibrating.

29:20.720 --> 29:22.560
Are coordinates.

29:22.560 --> 29:23.960
That's what Kramer
chose this crystal ...

29:23.960 --> 29:26.080
especially for
lead us to shreds.

29:26.480 --> 29:29.480
The Rocky Mountains, is where
is the following passage.

29:29.760 --> 29:33.200
Hey, we can not go there.
Our parents are in Thailand.

29:33.200 --> 29:34.680
We have to go there,
we have to save them.

29:34.680 --> 29:37.200
No, we have to go by the fragment.
It is what a true hunter would.

29:37.200 --> 29:39.520
Perhaps we are not real
Hunters, right Paxton?

29:39.520 --> 29:44.000
As much as it pains me to be of
According to her, Dylan is right.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.680
If achieved Krugen
these fragments, mom ...

29:45.680 --> 29:47.840
serna and dad as little
of our problems.

29:47.840 --> 29:52.120
Remember what they always say?
Sometimes you have to quilting.

29:54.200 --> 29:56.240
Sometimes you have to
make the tough decisions.

29:56.240 --> 30:00.400
Exactly. And I want to look
so hard as you, but ...

30:00.400 --> 30:05.000
go see the fragments in
of by them is the difficult decision.

30:05.600 --> 30:07.600
That's what they wanted to do.

30:13.160 --> 30:14.840
- Give me your wallet.
- For what?

30:14.840 --> 30:16.200
Just do it.

30:19.600 --> 30:22.080
I'll get tickets at the
next flight to Denver.

30:27.760 --> 30:30.040
<i> Listen carefully. </ i></i>

30:30.040 --> 30:32.360
<i> This part is very important. </ i></i>

30:32.360 --> 30:37.200
I do not care that you have to
do, who you have to hurt,

30:37.200 --> 30:41.800
Flynn those kids now have
and I want a piece.

30:59.600 --> 31:01.280
You must be hungry.

31:02.280 --> 31:03.640
Not so.

31:04.760 --> 31:07.400
¿Carter is with you '
I can order more food.

31:11.080 --> 31:12.440
Carter is lost.

31:12.760 --> 31:14.240
Where are my children?

31:14.240 --> 31:17.240
Last I heard,
on a plane to Colorado.

31:17.240 --> 31:21.760
They are fine. By the way, I'm
Very impressed with you guys.

31:21.760 --> 31:23.440
I've always been.

31:28.600 --> 31:33.200
Oh, please, I'm unarmed!
No one else here. Just you and me.

31:33.200 --> 31:36.400
Two old friends, talking.

31:36.440 --> 31:39.600
- Eat something.
- Your you swear.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.680
The same day that Carter and we did.

31:43.080 --> 31:47.360
Oh, yes, the famous
Hunter oath,

31:47.360 --> 31:51.800
"find and protect." "I never use it"

31:52.000 --> 31:56.920
As a child my father repeated
that oath again and again.

31:56.920 --> 32:02.040
Find and protect these
artifacts we never use.

32:03.800 --> 32:06.440
He mostly by hunters.

32:06.440 --> 32:07.840
Everything.

32:10.400 --> 32:12.920
I know what happened to your father.

32:16.480 --> 32:20.080
Did you know what was
Hunting in his last mission?

32:21.400 --> 32:23.280
The cup of holy grail.

32:23.880 --> 32:27.440
The cup that heals. And
end when he was injured ...

32:27.440 --> 32:30.760
and lying on the ground,
had it in his hands.

32:30.760 --> 32:35.440
The only thing in the world
that could save ...

32:35.440 --> 32:38.520
I begged to drink
it, and you know who told me

32:38.520 --> 32:42.840
Find and protect, never used.

32:43.240 --> 32:46.800
Those were his last words.

32:46.840 --> 32:51.080
That was the day I said to you and
Carter was not a hunter.

32:51.080 --> 32:54.120
And we respect your decision, right?

32:54.320 --> 32:58.840
You delete the records and
nobody remembers what it used to be.

32:58.960 --> 33:02.840
But your father was right, these
objects do not belong to us.

33:02.840 --> 33:07.080
- We belong to you all!
- You mad.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.920
Friends do not insult friends.

33:12.920 --> 33:19.640
I know what the mirror. "Look in
on and fulfill your deepest desire. "

33:24.920 --> 33:26.680
Yes, it is drugged.

33:28.880 --> 33:33.040
We were talking about the magic mirror
and all you want is an apple.

33:34.200 --> 33:36.280
Does anyone else see the irony?

33:36.280 --> 33:41.320
My deepest desire is to have
the most loyal followers.

33:41.320 --> 33:46.320
Because only then podre
Hunters make sure ...

33:46.320 --> 33:50.600
eliminated by the
anything where they belong.

33:50.920 --> 33:52.480
All of them.

33:55.360 --> 33:57.880
Upload it to the plane.
We leave in 30 minutes.

33:57.880 --> 33:59.440
Yes, sir.

34:17.520 --> 34:18.480
What surprises you?

34:18.480 --> 34:21.159
That their parents do not
saying they are hunters.

34:22.239 --> 34:24.040
Being hunters is its
birthright.

34:24.040 --> 34:26.679
The powers passed from parents to children.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
¿Powers? What kind of powers?

34:29.000 --> 34:32.159
No literal powers, Trip.

34:32.159 --> 34:35.679
- And not so special.
- Speak for yourself.

34:35.880 --> 34:38.400
The strength of a hunter
comes from his family.

34:38.400 --> 34:41.199
Each family is known for
a particular feature.

34:41.199 --> 34:44.960
Mine, the clan is Savini
Known for their loyalty.

34:44.960 --> 34:48.880
The clan is Panani
Known for his inventiveness.

34:48.880 --> 34:51.080
And Hester, by
know how to keep secrets.

34:51.080 --> 34:54.600
- And what about the Flynns?
- Perseverance.

34:54.600 --> 34:57.000
It means never give up.

34:58.240 --> 34:59.560
I knew it.

34:59.560 --> 35:03.000
I regret not letting me sort by
people I have ever met.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.760
Paxton does not believe in
power of the family.

35:05.760 --> 35:07.880
Okay, that's not true.

35:07.880 --> 35:12.360
How to cross the ocean is just believing
in the family? I call it escape.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.360
It is doing something amazing.

35:14.360 --> 35:17.880
If it's good, but it is only
feat're not helping anyone.

35:17.880 --> 35:21.440
Okay, you're amazing,
great, blah blah blah.

35:21.440 --> 35:23.520
You think it's easy? I
like to see that you tried.

35:23.560 --> 35:27.160
I would, you would if
you had invited me.

35:27.160 --> 35:29.400
You're always very great for me.

35:29.520 --> 35:31.240
<i> Guys, hurry up! </ i></i>

35:32.600 --> 35:35.360
- Guys?
- Yup.

35:35.960 --> 35:37.240
We're coming.

35:37.240 --> 35:38.920
Wait, trip ...

35:53.800 --> 35:55.520
Now what?

35:56.120 --> 35:58.000
Now the climb.

36:04.920 --> 36:06.280
Great.

36:31.240 --> 36:33.560
We left to find the
fragment and then intervene.

36:33.560 --> 36:36.480
No case is getting dirty
hands if you do not have to.

36:42.760 --> 36:47.360
Okay, must be
around here somewhere.

36:55.680 --> 36:57.360
Hey guys, look.

36:59.640 --> 37:02.280
- Hieroglyphics?
- Pictograms.

37:02.280 --> 37:04.480
The hieroglyphs are
Curved unpainted.

37:04.480 --> 37:08.280
What you do not know the difference
between hieroglyphs and pictograms?

37:08.280 --> 37:10.760
Okay continues
moving in that direction.

37:15.960 --> 37:17.640
It seems certain.

37:18.440 --> 37:20.000
I got this.

37:24.240 --> 37:29.000
- Trip, think.
- How was I to know it would happen?

37:29.000 --> 37:33.400
At least disable
the trap, now follow.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.360
Are you coming?

37:41.720 --> 37:47.240
- Women, do not you?
- Not all women, just her.

38:06.520 --> 38:09.920
- What's that?
- The history of the mirror.

38:10.720 --> 38:12.720
- How?
- It's a warning.

38:12.720 --> 38:14.960
He warns people
not to look in the mirror.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.360
Guys.

38:18.160 --> 38:19.520
This way.

38:41.600 --> 38:43.240
We will need this.

38:43.600 --> 38:44.560
Good job.

38:44.560 --> 38:46.640
If there is not problem-

38:46.640 --> 38:48.280
Yes, good job.

38:57.800 --> 38:59.600
Where did that light come from?

39:02.560 --> 39:05.360
Okay, have to be here.

39:05.360 --> 39:08.400
There is no code or script.

39:09.120 --> 39:11.280
It is a sign of Native American water.

39:16.160 --> 39:19.200
It is broken. By the way.

39:20.080 --> 39:21.160
Water diverted.

39:21.160 --> 39:22.120
You can not divert water.

39:22.160 --> 39:26.160
We can not but stop.

39:26.960 --> 39:28.760
You'd have to find where it comes from.

39:35.200 --> 39:36.560
Excellent!

39:36.560 --> 39:39.280
Paxton is smarter
than it seems.

39:43.760 --> 39:45.160
Care.

39:45.560 --> 39:47.240
It could be a trap for fools.

39:47.440 --> 39:48.800
It's okay.

39:49.800 --> 39:52.520
Okay, get ready to run.

39:53.440 --> 39:54.760
1-2 ...

40:00.760 --> 40:02.120
Three.

40:03.280 --> 40:06.960
Is that all? Nothing of
Murros lightning or collapsing?

40:06.960 --> 40:10.040
Okay, running.

40:11.040 --> 40:13.120
I wanted to get away from something, you know ...

40:15.080 --> 40:17.960
A large rock, or whatever.

40:17.960 --> 40:21.200
Nothing?What a disappointment!

40:26.480 --> 40:28.040
Hold this.

40:28.040 --> 40:29.640
We see them, they are going down now.

40:31.120 --> 40:32.800
If they have the
vessel fragment.

40:32.800 --> 40:36.040
Excellent. Remember
should not be hurt.

40:36.040 --> 40:38.480
Hunters need
feel hunted.

40:38.480 --> 40:41.680
- But I can get rid of them.
- Stick to the plan.

40:44.360 --> 40:49.280
It is a safe, not a container.
- Really?

40:52.920 --> 40:55.480
- If you hurt ...
- Hurt? Are you kidding?

40:56.240 --> 40:59.040
They are brilliant! run out
no training ...

40:59.040 --> 41:01.560
have traced
two of the fragments.

41:01.560 --> 41:03.800
The hired to find
the last fragment ...

41:03.800 --> 41:05.520
and the mirror,
but no need.

41:05.520 --> 41:10.280
- They will free.
- I know my boys.

41:10.280 --> 41:13.280
- Do not help.
- Really?

41:13.280 --> 41:18.240
One hour will be the
phone pleading for help.

41:24.480 --> 41:26.040
Careful.

41:27.360 --> 41:29.000
The most I can.

41:30.520 --> 41:33.080
Do not scare was just the plan?

41:33.080 --> 41:36.400
Yeah, well, accidents happen.

41:38.960 --> 41:40.640
Underway.

41:49.560 --> 41:51.400
Guys, watch!

41:52.440 --> 41:53.960
Do we escape or something?

41:53.960 --> 41:57.040
- I take it back.
- We have to go.Come on!

41:57.480 --> 41:59.480
- Hasten.
- This way.

42:02.480 --> 42:03.800
Hurry!

42:04.920 --> 42:07.160
- There they are.
- That's terrible.

42:09.240 --> 42:11.760
- We lost.
- Down here.

42:19.680 --> 42:22.000
See if you can still follow us.

42:26.040 --> 42:27.440
You're welcome.

42:33.160 --> 42:34.800
Even follow us.

42:35.360 --> 42:37.960
All right, come on, come on.

42:45.680 --> 42:47.480
All right, keep moving.

42:50.960 --> 42:54.040
- What a brilliant plan!
- Do you have a better one?

42:54.040 --> 42:57.240
This way. I have a plan,
but not going to like it.

42:57.240 --> 42:59.680
- Does it matter?
- Good point.

43:03.360 --> 43:05.680
You will not like that.

43:16.600 --> 43:20.080
- Are you okay?
- Yup.

43:27.520 --> 43:29.760
- So that was your brilliant plan?
- Yup.

43:29.760 --> 43:31.120
Really?

43:33.280 --> 43:35.080
- Follow them!
- But ...

43:38.360 --> 43:39.720
Come on, come on!

43:44.080 --> 43:47.280
Is this one of those
accidents for which you spoke?

43:50.720 --> 43:52.120
Keep moving.

44:09.920 --> 44:12.000
- Dylan?
- What?

44:12.120 --> 44:13.480
Good plan.

44:16.960 --> 44:18.320
Thank you.

44:19.240 --> 44:21.160
But did not have to push.

44:21.960 --> 44:23.160
Trip Are you okay?

44:23.160 --> 44:27.320
Besides yanking taste
prematurely this, yes.

44:27.320 --> 44:29.000
I think I'm good.

44:29.000 --> 44:32.880
If Krugen found us here
likely to find us again.

44:32.880 --> 44:35.960
We need a way
to move. Traveling.

44:37.760 --> 44:41.760
Trip, now is the time
call Mason.

44:44.640 --> 44:46.320
At the right moment.

44:46.720 --> 44:48.520
- Hello there?
- Mason, Paxton talks.

44:48.520 --> 44:53.160
Paxton, a wonderful surprise, how
you? How is your parents?

44:53.160 --> 44:56.840
- Tryp and I need your help.
- Of course, whatever.

44:56.840 --> 45:02.800
Just tell me where you are.
- 39, 62, 10740.

45:21.800 --> 45:22.760
Thanks for coming.

45:22.760 --> 45:25.560
If Flynn are in trouble,
I'm here without question.

45:25.560 --> 45:28.840
Mason Fuller, this is Dylan.

45:28.840 --> 45:30.360
- A pleasure.
- How are you?

45:30.360 --> 45:32.760
Mason is one of the most
old family friends.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.240
- You're still filthy rich?
- More than ever!

45:36.560 --> 45:40.240
Mason, Mom and Dad
are missing.

45:42.720 --> 45:44.000
Tell me everything.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.480
I find this hard to believe.

45:46.480 --> 45:49.800
Yeah, so do we. Trust me.

45:49.800 --> 45:52.720
My parents never told you
nothing about hunters?

45:52.720 --> 45:55.960
Never. I thought know
everything about them.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Any idea where
are your parents?

45:58.000 --> 46:01.640
They were in Thailand.
We will find them.

46:01.640 --> 46:04.680
Yes, but first we have to find
the other fragments of the mirror.

46:04.680 --> 46:06.920
And then what?
Hide them ¿? ¿Destroy?

46:06.920 --> 46:10.120
This is my plan so far.
One found the fragment.

46:10.160 --> 46:11.800
Two, we find the mirror.

46:12.920 --> 46:14.280
And three?

46:14.280 --> 46:15.680
I said so far.

46:15.680 --> 46:18.640
All I thought was
a fairy tale, it's real.

46:18.640 --> 46:20.960
The mirror, hunters, Los Krugen.

46:20.960 --> 46:25.640
The other fragments
have, ¿I can see them?

46:27.320 --> 46:29.400
I dunno. We have already said a lot.

46:29.400 --> 46:34.640
Of course, I understand. Just wish
learn more to help better.

46:39.880 --> 46:42.080
Dylan, okay.

46:43.160 --> 46:44.520
Show him the fragments.

46:47.240 --> 46:48.600
very well-

47:08.400 --> 47:10.520
Not much to look at, right?

47:11.920 --> 47:13.280
Can ...

47:16.160 --> 47:19.120
They can feel the power?

47:27.920 --> 47:33.760
The other fragment, which Krugen
have not, where is it supposed to be?

47:34.200 --> 47:36.800
We do not know. Neither the mirror.

47:36.800 --> 47:41.680
The first leads us to the second.
We believe that are guided to each other.

47:43.280 --> 47:45.680
- Are those lyrics?
- Where?

47:45.680 --> 47:48.120
Hence, these are not just ornaments.

47:50.720 --> 47:52.760
Greek letters are backwards.

47:52.760 --> 47:58.480
Yes, it is. Let's go to my
office. I think I can help.

48:09.760 --> 48:10.760
Jordyn, I told you, these
guys are amazing!

48:10.760 --> 48:14.080
You should be very
proud. Listen to ...

48:14.080 --> 48:18.000
yourself, are the
other side of that door.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.920
So close and yet is
impossible to help you.

48:20.920 --> 48:23.480
It must be torture for a mother.

48:37.040 --> 48:38.360
Trip, can you read that?

48:38.360 --> 48:41.080
It is true. I am the
smarter here.

48:41.080 --> 48:44.120
- I can not read ancient Greek.
- I do.

48:46.320 --> 48:47.280
Rhodope.

48:47.280 --> 48:50.160
Benefits of a classical education.

48:51.440 --> 48:52.440
What is "Rhodope"?

48:52.440 --> 48:55.440
It's not what, it's who.

48:55.760 --> 48:58.000
Rhodope was a slave
Greek who married ...

48:58.000 --> 49:00.240
Egyptian Pharaoh
Amos II, after ...

49:00.240 --> 49:02.680
one of his slippers
fell from the sky during ...

49:02.680 --> 49:04.760
a celebration
the city of Memphis.

49:04.760 --> 49:06.800
- Sounds like Cinderella.
- Bingo.

49:06.800 --> 49:10.840
It says that it is the early version
the Cinderella story.

49:10.840 --> 49:13.400
Benefits of
education prees strain.

49:13.520 --> 49:16.320
Then the fragment is
somewhere in Egypt.

49:16.320 --> 49:18.600
No, in Boston.

49:18.600 --> 49:19.600
Boston?

49:19.600 --> 49:23.080
Newly acquired for the
permanent collection of tales ...

49:23.080 --> 49:26.720
Fairy slipper allegedly
used by the first Cinderella.

49:26.720 --> 49:29.680
- The fragment is in the shoe.
- Good Trip work.

49:29.680 --> 49:32.520
Jet will take the case we need
traveling internationally.

49:33.480 --> 49:35.600
- Mr. Fuller.
- Mason.

49:35.800 --> 49:40.080
Mason, with all respect,
you are not a hunter.

49:40.080 --> 49:42.160
This is our job, not yours.

49:42.160 --> 49:45.360
I have been a friend of the family
these guys for many ...

49:45.360 --> 49:49.160
years with their missing parents
feel some responsibility.

49:51.960 --> 49:56.600
Besides having someone
filthy rich as a companion ...

49:56.600 --> 50:01.040
of travel can not be
the worst thing, is it?

50:17.040 --> 50:19.400
Say yes or I'll get to mourn.

50:38.680 --> 50:40.560
It's gala dress.

50:40.560 --> 50:44.920
- You're definitely not dressed well.
- I could not get dressed like that.

50:44.920 --> 50:46.600
I have an idea.

51:17.600 --> 51:18.960
¿Pax '

51:27.560 --> 51:29.920
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

51:31.040 --> 51:36.280
- What do you think?
- I think I should use this.

51:37.680 --> 51:39.440
It's okay. I will.

52:01.120 --> 52:03.080
Gee, great lights.

52:06.240 --> 52:09.320
I mean, that's what we wanted.

52:09.440 --> 52:12.560
I could get used to this.

52:12.560 --> 52:16.640
- What about our clothes?
. I'll tell the driver to take her to Jet.

52:16.640 --> 52:20.400
Where are the pieces?
We should keep them with us.

52:20.400 --> 52:25.000
Oh, trust me. My Jet is
safer than Fort Nox.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.440
They will be safe there.

52:27.440 --> 52:29.320
Look great.

53:01.280 --> 53:02.840
Do your invitations, please?

53:02.840 --> 53:03.840
We are with him.

53:03.840 --> 53:05.920
Mr. Fuller. Fuller Industries.

53:08.280 --> 53:09.680
Sorry, we do not ...

53:09.680 --> 53:11.840
- Curator.
- Excuse me?

53:11.840 --> 53:14.600
Bring the Curator, please.

54:00.440 --> 54:02.680
I'm terribly sorry Mr Fuller.
Please accept my apologies.

54:02.680 --> 54:05.640
- No problem
- Agradeceos contribution.

54:05.640 --> 54:09.240
- We are surprised to see him this afternoon.
- Vine afterthought.

54:09.240 --> 54:12.440
You said it. Please enjoy.

54:12.440 --> 54:14.880
This is what I call a party.

54:14.880 --> 54:16.240
Ladies.

54:18.920 --> 54:20.280
Up there.

54:22.080 --> 54:23.600
The Glass Slipper.

54:57.200 --> 54:59.320
That is not yours.

55:44.400 --> 55:49.200
I'm proud. Met

55:51.720 --> 55:53.840
I will deactivate the alarm.

55:58.560 --> 56:00.440
How's Trip?

56:00.560 --> 56:03.560
- Not yet.
- Such power ...

56:04.880 --> 56:06.840
I can feel it from here.

56:07.720 --> 56:09.600
Veri cur do cuama tour.

56:13.960 --> 56:17.480
- Who is it?
- Excuse me?

56:17.480 --> 56:21.080
Trip, stop. Mason is a Hunter.

56:21.080 --> 56:22.480
What?

56:22.760 --> 56:25.360
Veri cur do cuama tour.

56:25.360 --> 56:28.600

use, "the oath of the hunter.

56:28.600 --> 56:30.840
- Mason what you mean?
- You are wrong.

56:30.880 --> 56:32.240
I'm not a hunter.

56:33.520 --> 56:36.640
- Not anymore.
- You're a Krugen.

56:36.640 --> 56:39.680

- Do it, it's not kidding.

56:44.200 --> 56:48.640
Pretty and smart.
It's to keep it, Paxton.

56:48.680 --> 56:51.440
Well, the alarm is disabled.

56:51.440 --> 56:55.000
See? properly motivated
We can do whatever we want.

56:55.000 --> 56:58.240
Boys. I enjoy.
Join me.

57:00.040 --> 57:03.800
With all due respect to her mom and dad,
but you three are much better.

57:03.800 --> 57:05.680
Where are my mom and dad?

57:07.560 --> 57:09.640
I regret to inform you that
your father is lost.

57:09.640 --> 57:12.160
- Hopefully forever.
- What?

57:12.560 --> 57:16.720
Find the mirror
together and then I ...

57:16.720 --> 57:21.680
I make sure they have
its deepest desire.

57:22.480 --> 57:28.640
Dylan, your family. Trip. Respect.

57:29.720 --> 57:35.000
Paxton know you'll eventually
leaving only browse any ...

57:35.000 --> 57:40.280
birthright
only and finally be at peace.

57:40.800 --> 57:43.920
Never will join you, right Pax?

57:46.080 --> 57:47.480
Right.

57:48.960 --> 57:52.120
Well, in that case.

57:52.120 --> 57:53.480
Small ...

57:56.080 --> 57:57.360
Catch it!

57:57.360 --> 57:59.640
- This way.
- Pax.

58:01.440 --> 58:03.680
Do not test me.

58:03.880 --> 58:06.320
- Pax, here.
- Do not!

58:06.440 --> 58:09.360
Tryp by here!

58:11.040 --> 58:14.800
Must realize that no
I need the three living.

58:18.040 --> 58:20.840
You want it?Catch it!

58:34.000 --> 58:36.320
- Caught you!
- Trip, run!

58:41.680 --> 58:43.640
They are escaping, come on!

59:03.840 --> 59:06.440
Now I like
Cinderella lost her slipper.

59:09.520 --> 59:10.880
Come on!

59:14.360 --> 59:16.480
- Mom!
- Come on, get in!

59:16.480 --> 59:18.240
Just time.

59:24.480 --> 59:27.880
- Mom, I thought you were ...
- Why are not you in school ?!

59:27.880 --> 59:30.240
Really we do this now?

59:32.520 --> 59:34.680
Glad you are well, son.

59:36.160 --> 59:40.560
¿Pax, Dylan? we see that
back together.

59:40.560 --> 59:42.800
- What?
- No, no, no, no

59:42.800 --> 59:45.480
- No, no.
- Mom, what about Dad?

59:45.480 --> 59:47.520
- Mason said ...
- I do not know Pax.

59:47.520 --> 59:50.840
But your father and
is a survivor.

59:50.840 --> 59:53.400
Mason has all the fragments.

59:53.400 --> 59:56.880
But it does not mirror
and do not know where.

59:57.360 --> 01:00:00.720
Guess what? I have.

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:04.160
Mr. Fuller have much
lucky he was not hurt.

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:06.560
It was more than luck. we must
find these thieves.

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:07.920
We will.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.160
- We must help the authorities.
- Do not need them.

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:18.440
We have fragments, but
do not know where the mirror is.

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:22.360
Not you, but I do.

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:27.320
I had forgotten how
forget your little secrets.

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:31.760
- Who gave you this?
- I had not seen before.

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:33.960
Is that what you seek Krugen?

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:37.320
- What is that stone?
- The key cave wolf.

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:40.920
¿Tomb? That sounds promising.

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:43.040
We go to Germany, guys.

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:47.760
Mrs.. Flynn after what happened in the
museum, police reviewed every plane.

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:51.320
No this aircraft Dylan.

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:03.200
We are European airspace. this
where the aircraft will need to go.

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:08.640
- Thanks, Skooner.
- Hope, ¿Skooner?

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.520
How Family Skonners hunters?

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:13.200
Here I am just a normal Captain
army cargo handling.

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:15.880
Your family is legendary
for help and support.

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:19.520
- Never leave a man behind.
- It's part of being a good soldier.

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:23.840
Besides Carter and Jordyn me
have saved several times.

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:28.080
- It's a pleasure.
- Follow me.

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:47.360
You've been a bit quiet since
we met again, all right?

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:52.680
Yes, I'm fine, just a little ...

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:58.880
- Do you think this good dad?
- Your dad is a very tough guy.

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:00.400
I have to believe that's fine.

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.880
It's okay. I want you to know
we were going to look for them ...

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:05.480
you and Dad as soon
as we had the fragments.

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:08.960
Pax, you did exactly the right thing.

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:12.880
Recover these fragments is
important than any of us.

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:17.880
Why they did not tell us
about hunters?

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:27.160
Do you remember your father
and we fought for something?

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:31.720
- No.
- Good, because we never fight.

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:36.160
Except for one thing. If you say or
not you and Tryp who were hunters.

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:40.520
He wanted to tell them,
but I will not let you.

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:44.960
Because become Hunters
was something that we ...

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:47.920
desire for both
even before birth.

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:55.240
Because sometimes the hunter
means you're the hunted.

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:59.480
And I thought something for you and Tryp.

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:03.840
Something your father and I
we never had. A childhood.

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:05.640
- A
.
- Yup.

01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:08.920
But all we had was a
part of his life that did not include us.

01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:13.960
Simply I can not believe you
Dylan shall tell all and not me.

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:16.720
Pax have to understand
that both his parents were ...

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:19.840
hunter-killed
when she was very young.

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:22.920
She has no family.

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:28.280
So we welcomed the hunters. only
try not to feel so alone.

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:34.200
The parents that we have no
means that we did not feel alone.

01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:37.680
Yes, now I know.

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:46.400
Pax, please do not come looking.

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:50.160
Anytime.

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:54.200
Come on.

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:02.240
Wait, this is my favorite part.

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:12.920
You're right, it's the Wolf Tusk.

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:16.160
It is fitting that the mirror
I was hidden all this ...

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:19.520
almost time
in my own backyard.

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:22.920
Just promise me that when
the time comes, I ...

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:25.560
you allow to deal with
Jordyn Flynn in my own way.

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:28.720
Of course, let me
see this again.

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:40.080
Great, a cemetery.

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:42.840
- Are you afraid of ghosts?
- No.

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:44.800
If you fear them. Remember
this Halloween?

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:47.320
Follow him and tell the
story of someone who ...

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:49.880
sleeping with the light
on until age 7.

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:52.480
- All right, all right
- No, I want to hear this.

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:54.280
No, to the following.

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:58.600
- Very funny, Mom.
- I'll tell you later Dylan.

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:04.960
Tomb of the wolf, will not have
a sign on the door, do you?

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:11.720
It is made of solid granite.

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:16.160
- Lacking a tooth.
- The wolf tooth.

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:30.960
Is a sequence of three. are
hundreds of possible combinations.

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.240
Another puzzle.

01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:36.240
If you press the buttons on the
wrong order, everything will collapse.

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:40.840
Or explode or launch
stakes, we know.

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:44.600
It is the wolf, the wolf is the key.

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:46.360
What do you mean?

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:55.640
The wolf he sees, hears
and uses its fangs.

01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:04.720
I always liked that story.

01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:36.160
- We made it.
- Certainly they succeeded.

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:39.240
Nice trick. Pretender
disable the alarm. I dunno ...

01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:42.480
if you should hold your
hand or send you to your room.

01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:44.520
None I would.

01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:45.800
I love this guy.

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:48.400
Mason not do it again.

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:53.760
I will not do it, it would be bad. Oops, that fear.

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:58.400
Jordyn the world is divided into
two types of people those who ...

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:01.920
are slaves to tradition
ancient civilizations and entire

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:06.200
And those who are like me. prior to
Hunters become my family ...

01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:09.960
decency of gorgos
Greece, as Krugen.

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:13.000
The former ruled gorgos
men for millennia ...

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.440
and that is my true
birthright.

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:16.440
¿Gorgos?

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:20.520
People need leadership, not old
Scientists order boring ...

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:23.600
that protect them from things
appearing at night.

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:27.480
The world needs me
me, not hunters!

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:30.560
You'll have to spend on
us to reach the mirror.

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:35.880
Jordyn disappointed
While you say that.

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:39.560
- Knights.
- Wait.

01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:44.000
You talked seriously in the museum?

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.120
What if I help you get the
mirror, you give me everything I want?

01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:50.560
- Pax!
- If, Pax.

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:53.280
You can finally begin your journey.

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:55.720
Free your family.

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:01.440
Pax, you know what you're doing.

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:04.840
If I know, Mom.

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:07.240
Perhaps for the first time.

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:12.760
- What was that?
- A trap.

01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:14.800
The tomb is closing. we
We're running out of time.

01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:17.399
- Take it.
- Finally.

01:08:17.399 --> 01:08:20.479
- We gotta get out of here.
- We do, but you remain.

01:08:20.479 --> 01:08:22.000
That's not what you said.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.840
Generations are better if the
Flynn family die in this ...

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:28.640
grave, do you think? bring
to small. It has been very helpful.

01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:30.479
What?No, no!Let me go!

01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:38.120
If you do not mind this world
is far below me.

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:39.960
Dylan!

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:49.920
We need to find
way out of here.

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:08.640
- Is that a snake?
- There is a Viper.

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:11.920
- They are native to Europe.
- All right.

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:15.479
- It is very helpful.
- And has a friend.

01:09:17.359 --> 01:09:18.960
Hunters always kept
watched all your boxes ...

01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:20.720
Safety. we just have
to find a way out.

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:22.000
Your we sold!

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.319
He knew what he was doing, how
agreement? He had a plan.

01:09:24.319 --> 01:09:27.920
- Yes, and I worked very well.
- We have to save Dylan.

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:30.840
- That's all that matters.
- We can not stuck here.

01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:35.880
Maybe not. This place is designed to
the dark minds. Lights out.

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:38.920
- We can not see without the lights.
- We can not see the lights.

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:41.960
And what about our friends
they like creeping darkness?

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:43.880
Trust me, Trip.

01:09:54.279 --> 01:09:55.960
- Trip?
- Now what?

01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:58.680
- Do not grab the foot.
- I'm not near you.

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:03.960
- Do not move.
- Oh, thank you very much.Mom!

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:13.840
Wait. Where the wolf
this. Here it is. We have to ...

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:17.360
Pax, move now!

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:18.720
Okay, okay.

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:22.960
- I hate snakes.
- Well, it's is the output.

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:33.120
- Why here?
- Yup.

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:34.800
No problem.

01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:06.160
Okay, it's out there.

01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:11.920
Wait, how are we
Paxton trust?

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:16.560
- Should we distrust you?
- No.

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:20.600
- Do you have a plan?
- And even if I think it can work.

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:25.040
It's okay. He convinced me.

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:34.920
Come on, Tryp, are family!

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:44.120
Where you go, I go.

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:03.920
That is. That is the castle of Mason.

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:05.280
Come on.

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:13.920
What is this place?

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:17.320
If you tell them that here Vivian
the 7 dwarfs, would you believe me?

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:21.240
Stop amaze days ago.

01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:25.600
So if there Vivian 7
dwarf must have a mine nearby.

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:34.280
And this is the entrance
Secret Castle Mason.

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:46.640
- Can we get some?
- Find and protect.

01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:51.560
- Never use.
- Is it a rule or just a guide?

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:53.240
Come on, go!

01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:57.960
Regrésalos!

01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:02.440
What are you doing?

01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:05.400
Show the results
you to send me to ...

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:08.440
to boarding
private. Spectrogram.

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:11.400
Nothing.

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:15.440
There's a dead spot in front.
Without reading a shielded area.

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:19.680
Mason's lair. there
must have Mason and Dylan.

01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:22.480
- And how we got there?
- Working on it.

01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:24.320
Infrared images.

01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:31.360
What I have!

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:33.600
Can you find a
alternative entrance?

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:36.880
Come on, I was enjoying
the main pop.

01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:42.520
- That way we can get.
- All right.

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.360
Well, little brother.

01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:56.760
The Shield of Perseus.

01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:59.440
acquisitions
mine were not easy.

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:02.720
The most valuable were never easy.

01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:06.560
Mason, do not do this.

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:09.280
You're smart enough
to know that you'll never win.

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:15.040
Sure in your small group
friends consider you smart.

01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:19.680
However, this is exactly
looks like winning.

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:36.120
The door.

01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:37.880
Stay with mom.

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:18.720
You did not leave even one.

01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:24.880
Remind me never to upset you.

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:34.320
Mason, I know you have
betrayed by hunters ...

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:37.200
and perhaps by the
world, but do not do this.

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:41.920
You really are lovely.

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:49.160
When purchasing power
definitive remind me not off.

01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:55.520
It is complete.

01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:00.920
I knew you were a coward.

01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:05.920
Well, well, but if
Flynn are the guys.

01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:10.560
- Where is Mommy?
- Not achievement.

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:14.040
- Too bad.
- Do not take it so apecho.

01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:16.600
Being an orphan, he helped me a lot.

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:19.800
What are you waiting for? Do it.

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:23.320
Pax, do not want it
I looked at him, remember?

01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:25.880
Trust me. It will not.

01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:31.120
All your talk about power
of Gorgos, as Krugen ...

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:35.280
are their descendants. what
All that was babblings are.

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:39.240
If you were really a
Hunter not you would use me.

01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:42.880
I am a hunter clan Flynn.

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:48.560
And your ancestors are laughing at you.

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:04.440
Mirror please
tell me with your power ...

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:10.560
God make me the
powerful of the Krugen.

01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:25.120
Wait ... No, stop!

01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:01.640
Pax, you knew this was going to happen.

01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:04.840
Since Mason started
to boast that it was ...

01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:08.240
descendant of the
Corgos. Corgos of gorgons.

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:09.920
- Medusa.
- The Curse of Medusa.

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:11.680
Turn people to stone.

01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:14.760
You wanted it to look in the mirror
wanted to be a gorgon.

01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:17.840
And look in the mirror
would become stone.

01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:28.280
Sorry, I did not even know.

01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:33.000
- No problem.
- What are you talking?

01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:36.800
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:41.640
Mom?

01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:48.480
Do you realize that we use are given
the mirror to get your father?

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:50.760
Mom, that's the curse of the mirror.

01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:53.040
Turn against you desire.

01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:56.960
Mom, we love dad
back as much as you, believe me.

01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:58.760
It has to be done.

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:09.520
Mirror, mirror on the wall give me
this desire, Destroy yourself to yourself.

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:15.240
We have to go
here now, come on!

01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:56.240
Sometimes we have to
make the tough decisions.

01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:02.000
Come on.

01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:32.600
Tryp, you sure are
the correct coordinates?

01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:33.920
100% safe!

01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:35.040
Mom?

01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:38.040
The satellite passes directly
about the place at 12 pm each day.

01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:40.480
If your father is here is exactly
where we need to be.

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:44.000
- What time is it?
- 11:59:50, 10 seconds left.

01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:45.720
Carter.

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:52.040
- Thanks for coming.
- Thank you for inviting me.

01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:56.560
Mom, what this means

01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:03.600
- This encrypted. An old code.
- What kind of code?

01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:07.560
A distress call. The last seen
we use this code your father and I ...

01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:10.360
It's dad, has to be.

01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:15.280
- What is your position?
- Peru.

01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:19.400
- I know that language.
- It's your father.

01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:22.000
- Come on,
- I'll get you tickets to Peru.

01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:24.000
I will pass this to the computer.

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:27.480
Pax, this boat back to shore.

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:30.800
- Full speed.
- Roger that.

01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:13.920
