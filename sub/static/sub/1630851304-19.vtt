WEBVTT

00:02.137 --> 00:04.724
TONIGHT...WITH
EMOTIONS RUNNING HIGH AND

00:04.758 --> 00:07.517
TWO POWER VETOES IN PLAY,
WHO WILL ULTIMATELY END UP

00:07.551 --> 00:09.172
ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK?

00:09.206 --> 00:13.931
WELCOME TO LIVE EVICTION
NIGHT ON "BIG BROTHER."

00:13.965 --> 00:17.793
PREVIOUSLY ON "BIG BROTHER"...THE

00:17.827 --> 00:21.517
COOKOUT ALLIANCE WAS
WELL-HIDDEN BECAUSE EACH

00:21.551 --> 00:24.103
MEMBER HAD A PARTNER
OUTSIDE OF THE GROUP.

00:24.137 --> 00:26.206
YOU HAVE DEREK X.

00:26.241 --> 00:27.758
I HAVE CLAIRE.

00:27.793 --> 00:29.413
DEREK X. HAS CHRISTIAN.

00:29.448 --> 00:30.551
AZAH HAS HIM.

00:30.586 --> 00:35.172
THEY VETO IF THEY NEED
ANYONE.

00:35.206 --> 00:36.931
WITH KYLAND WINNING POWER.

00:36.965 --> 00:39.896
KYLAND, YOU'RE THE NEW
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD.

00:39.931 --> 00:40.793
CONGRATULATIONS.

00:40.827 --> 00:45.310
HE ONLY
HAD THREE POSSIBLE

00:45.344 --> 00:46.137
TARGETS.

00:46.172 --> 00:47.000
BRIT TRIED

00:47.034 --> 00:50.034
TO STRIKE A DEAL WITH KYLE
TO BE SAVED.

00:50.068 --> 00:51.965
I'M HOPING TO STRIKE A
DEAL.

00:52.000 --> 00:52.827
IN EXCHANGE FOR THAT.

00:52.862 --> 00:53.758
GOT IT.

00:53.793 --> 00:56.551
THOSE ARE TERMS THAT FEEL
GOOD TO ME.

00:56.586 --> 00:59.172
AND BIG
"D" OFFERED TO BE A PAWN

00:59.206 --> 01:01.344
TO HELP PROTECT HER AS
WELL.

01:01.379 --> 01:05.344
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS
WRONG WITH ME, IF I

01:05.379 --> 01:08.655
HAVEN'T HAD ENOUGH SLEEP,
BUT I'M GOING TO PROTECT

01:08.689 --> 01:09.689
HER FROM THE BLOCK.

01:09.724 --> 01:13.344
I'VE NOMINATED YOU,
CLAIRE, AND YOU, DEREK F.

01:13.379 --> 01:16.275
TIFFANY DIDN'T WANT HER CLOSE ALLY

01:16.310 --> 01:16.896
TO GO.

01:16.931 --> 01:18.172
CHAIR IS ON THE BLOCK.

01:18.206 --> 01:20.379
EVEN THOUGH THEY IS NOT
PART OF THE COOKOUT, I'M

01:20.413 --> 01:21.724
NOT READY TO LOSE HER.

01:21.758 --> 01:25.310
SO SHE
CONVINCED KYLAND TO CHANGE

01:25.344 --> 01:26.275
TARGETS.

01:26.310 --> 01:30.413
CLAIRE TALKS AND SHE
LISTENS TO ME, TOO.

01:30.448 --> 01:32.724
TIFFANY IS PRETTY
CONFIDENT ABOUT NOT

01:32.758 --> 01:34.344
KNOWING WHAT CLAIRE IS
GOING TO DO.

01:34.379 --> 01:36.034
THIS MAKES ME MORE
CONFIDENT ABOUT KEEPING

01:36.068 --> 01:38.137
CLAIRE AND THE HOUSE
ANOTHER WEEK.

01:38.172 --> 01:42.379
A NEW
TWIST CALLED THE

01:42.413 --> 01:46.344
HIGH-ROLLER'S ROOM ALLOWED
HOUSEGUESTS TO GAMBLE FOR

01:46.379 --> 01:47.275
POWER.

01:47.310 --> 01:51.275
AND KYLAND, BIG "D,"
CLAIRE --

01:51.310 --> 01:54.379
I AM GOING TO BET ON
KYLAND.

01:54.413 --> 01:57.206
-- AND
SARAH BETH ALL EARNED THE

01:57.241 --> 02:01.551
RIGHT TO PLACE BETS IN THE
VETO COMPETITION, IN HOPES

02:01.586 --> 02:04.620
OF WINNING A SECOND VETO.

02:04.655 --> 02:06.689
WITH TWO VETOS ON THE
LINE...

02:06.724 --> 02:09.689
YOU GOT IT.

02:09.724 --> 02:11.344
...ALYSSA
AND KYLAND BOTH SCORED

02:11.379 --> 02:12.275
BIG.

02:12.310 --> 02:14.137
I'M SO EXCITED TO WIN
THE POWER OF VETO.

02:14.172 --> 02:17.517
EVEN THOUGH I LOST THE
COMPETITION, I STILL WIN A

02:17.551 --> 02:18.517
VETO.

02:18.551 --> 02:21.793
WITH ALYSSA ENSURING HER
SAFETY, THIS LOCKED IN

02:21.827 --> 02:24.241
BRITINI AS MY TARGET FOR
THIS WEEK.

02:24.275 --> 02:25.344
DEREK F.

02:25.379 --> 02:28.482
PITCHED TO BACK DOOR DEREK
X.

02:28.517 --> 02:31.275
IF HE IS STILL HERE,
NEXT WEEK HE HAS THE

02:31.310 --> 02:34.724
OPPORTUNITY TO WIN H.O.H.,
AND I GET SCARED.

02:34.758 --> 02:38.103
BUT KYLAND
HAD HIS SIGHTS SET ON

02:38.137 --> 02:39.172
BRITINI.

02:39.206 --> 02:42.310
WHAT IF HE SAYS, HEY, I
DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING

02:42.344 --> 02:43.310
TO HAPPEN.

02:43.344 --> 02:45.862
AND WHEN
BRIT FOUND OUT, SHE WENT

02:45.896 --> 02:46.482
ON THE OFFENSIVE.

02:46.517 --> 02:50.827
I DON'T WANT HIM TO...

02:50.862 --> 02:52.137
I WAS SERIOUS ABOUT THE

02:52.172 --> 02:53.620
DEAL THAT WE MADE.

02:53.655 --> 02:56.482
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MEANS
SOMETHING TO YOU, KYLAND,

02:56.517 --> 02:59.275
BUT IT MEANS SOMETHING TO
ME.

02:59.310 --> 03:00.344
TONIGHT...WILL KYLAND GO

03:00.379 --> 03:03.344
THROUGH WITH HIS PLAN TO
PUT THE BLACK BELT ON THE

03:03.379 --> 03:04.379
BLOCK?

03:04.413 --> 03:07.000
AND WITH TWO VETOS IN
PLAY, IT IS ANYONE'S GUEST

03:07.034 --> 03:12.448
WHO WILL BE THE FIRST
HOUSEGUEST SENT TO JURY.

03:12.482 --> 03:14.448
PLUS A NEW HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD WILL BE CROWNED.

03:14.482 --> 03:18.275
ALL THIS LIVE ON "BIG
BROTHER"!

03:18.310 --> 03:23.310
OH, MY GOSH.

03:23.344 --> 03:29.965
GOOD EVENING.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.586
I'M JULIE CHEN MOONVES.

03:31.620 --> 03:33.482
WELCOME TO "BIG BROTHER."

03:33.517 --> 03:37.413
FOR THE SECOND WEEK IN A
ROW, CHAOS ERUPTED IN THE

03:37.448 --> 03:41.724
MOMENTS PRIOR TO THE VETO
MEETING, LEAVING KYLAND'S

03:41.758 --> 03:43.482
FINAL NOMINEES UP IN THE
AIR.

03:43.517 --> 03:47.000
TONIGHT WE'LL FIND OUT IF
EITHER VETO WILL BE USED,

03:47.034 --> 03:49.965
AND IF SO, WHO WILL WIND
UP ON THE BLOCK?

03:50.000 --> 03:52.448
WHO WILL BE EVICTED,
BECOMING THE FIRST MEMBER

03:52.482 --> 03:54.275
OF THE JURY?

03:54.310 --> 03:56.413
WE'LL FIND OUT LIVE
TONIGHT.

03:56.448 --> 04:00.482
BUT, FIRST, IT IS TIME TO
SEE IF BRITINI'S EMOTIONAL

04:00.517 --> 04:03.000
PLEA WILL CHANGE HER FATE.

04:03.034 --> 04:05.586
THIS IS THE VETO
MEETING.

04:05.620 --> 04:09.896
CLAIRE AND DEREK HAVE BEEN
NOMINATED FOR EVICTION,

04:09.931 --> 04:12.379
BUT KYLAND AND I EACH HAVE
THE POWER TO VETO ONE OF

04:12.413 --> 04:13.448
THE NOMINATIONS.

04:13.482 --> 04:16.620
KYLAND, AS THE WINNER OF
THE VETO DERBY VETO, YOU

04:16.655 --> 04:18.655
GET TO MAKE THE FIRST
DECISION.

04:18.689 --> 04:29.000
I HAVE DECIDED TO USE
THE POWER OF VETO ON

04:29.034 --> 04:29.482
CLAIRE.

04:29.517 --> 04:36.448
COME HERE, QUEEN.

04:36.482 --> 04:40.965
I THINK I VETOED ONE OF

04:41.000 --> 04:42.827
MY NOMINATIONS FOR
EVICTION, AND NOW I HAVE

04:42.862 --> 04:49.551
TO NAME A REPLACEMENT
NOMINEE.

04:49.586 --> 05:00.482
UNFORTUNATELY, BRITINI
GOT VETOED.

05:00.517 --> 05:09.896
I HAVE DECIDED NOT TO

05:09.931 --> 05:19.586
USE THE POWER OF VETO.

05:19.620 --> 05:24.448
THIS VETO MEETING IS

05:24.482 --> 05:27.517
ADJOURNED.

05:27.551 --> 05:29.517
I DECIDED NOT TO USE

05:29.551 --> 05:32.448
THE POWER OF VETO BECAUSE
HONESTLY, OTHER THAN

05:32.482 --> 05:35.379
XAVIER, I FEEL LIKE
EVERYONE IS AGAINST ME AT

05:35.413 --> 05:36.482
THIS POINT.

05:36.517 --> 05:38.517
PLUS, IF I WOULD HAVE USED
IT, XAVIER COULD HAVE BEEN

05:38.551 --> 05:40.448
BACK-DOORED AND THAT WOULD
NOT BE GOOD FOR MY GAME.

05:40.482 --> 05:43.793
I VOLUNTEERED TO BE A
PAWN WHEN I THOUGHT IT WAS

05:43.827 --> 05:46.793
GOING AGAINST OTHER PEOPLE
BESIDES BRITINI.

05:46.827 --> 05:49.379
EVERYONE ELSE, I HAVE NO
PROBLEM GRIPPING THEM BY

05:49.413 --> 05:51.620
THEIR HAIR AND DRAGGING
THEM THROUGH THE MUD IF I

05:51.655 --> 05:55.379
NEED TO, BUT THERE IS NO
WAY I CAN CAMPAIGN AGAINST

05:55.413 --> 05:56.068
BRITINI.

05:56.103 --> 05:58.413
OH, KYLAND, YOU SAVED
ME.

05:58.448 --> 06:01.275
NO, KYLAND, YOU WERE
DANGLING ME OVER THE CLIFF

06:01.310 --> 06:03.137
AND AT THE LAST MINUTE YOU
PULLED ME UP.

06:03.172 --> 06:06.344
I'M NOT GOING TO SAY, HEY,
THANK YOU FOR PULLING ME

06:06.379 --> 06:07.448
UP.

06:07.482 --> 06:09.103
I'M GOING TO SAY, WHY THE
HECK DID YOU PUSH ME OVER

06:09.137 --> 06:10.827
THE CLIFF IN THE FIRST
PLACE?

06:10.862 --> 06:14.344
THERE ARE A FEW PEOPLE
I WANTED TO PUT UP THERE,

06:14.379 --> 06:16.241
BUT THIS WASN'T THE RIGHT
TIME TO DO SO.

06:16.275 --> 06:18.586
THIS WEEK FIVE VOTES
FOR THE EVICTION, AND FOUR

06:18.620 --> 06:22.862
VOTES CREATES A TIE, AND I
DECIDE THE EVICTION.

06:22.896 --> 06:26.448
SINCE I WON THE COOKOUT,
WE SO HAVE THE VOTES TO

06:26.482 --> 06:32.758
SEND BRITINI HOME NO
MATTER WHAT.

06:32.793 --> 06:37.137
WE CAN DO IT.

06:37.172 --> 06:41.034
I FREAKIN' KNEW IT.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.068
IT COULDN'T BE THE H.O.H.

06:43.103 --> 06:46.034
PUTTING ME ON THE FREAKIN'
BLOCK, COULD IT?

06:46.068 --> 06:47.034
I DON'T GET IT.

06:47.068 --> 06:51.241
I DON'T GET IT AT ALL.

06:51.275 --> 06:53.275
THE FACT THAT YOU ARE SO
OBSESSED WITH ME THAT YOU

06:53.310 --> 06:58.931
CAN'T KEEP ME OFF THE DAM
BLOCK IN YOUR H.O.H.s,

06:58.965 --> 06:59.517
I'M SORRY.

06:59.551 --> 07:01.172
THAT IS OBSESSIVE TO ME.

07:01.206 --> 07:08.862
WHAT IN THE WORLD AM I UP
AGAINST?

07:08.896 --> 07:13.000
I CAN'T WITH KYLAND.

07:13.034 --> 07:16.551
HE SAID I WAS GOING TO BE
SAFE THIS WEEK, WHEN I

07:16.586 --> 07:17.689
KEPT HIM SAFE.

07:17.724 --> 07:20.275
AND I SAID, HELL, YES, AND
HE MADE A DEAL AND WENT

07:20.310 --> 07:21.310
BACK ON IT.

07:21.344 --> 07:25.931
I'M OFFERING THE NEXT
YOU'RE NOT A

07:25.965 --> 07:28.344
TARGET OF MINE; I'M NOT A
TARGET OF YOURS.

07:28.379 --> 07:30.965
THOSE ARE TERMS THAT
FEEL GOOD TO ME.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.862
I'M SO SICK OF BEING
PICKED ON IN THIS HOUSE.

07:32.896 --> 07:36.034
I'M SO SICK OF IT.

07:36.068 --> 07:39.793
NOBODY CARES ABOUT ME AT
ALL.

07:39.827 --> 07:42.793
I'M SO SICK OF IT.

07:42.827 --> 07:44.827
FOUR OUT OF SIX WEEKS.

07:44.862 --> 07:49.241
I KNOW THAT THE PLAN OF
THE COOKOUT IS FOR OUR

07:49.275 --> 07:51.758
FRIENDS TO BE POTENTIALLY
SENT HOME.

07:51.793 --> 07:55.000
BUT IT STILL SUCKS TO SEE
BRITINI UP THERE.

07:55.034 --> 08:00.103
HAVING HER ON THE BLOCK
AND CRYING REALLY,

08:00.137 --> 08:01.241
HONESTLY BREAKS MY HEART.

08:01.275 --> 08:05.000
I'VE BEEN PICKED ON
EVERY WEEK IN THIS HOUSE.

08:05.034 --> 08:07.413
LOOK, BRITINI, I KNOW.

08:07.448 --> 08:11.896
LET'S LET IT OUT BECAUSE
WHEN WE OUT THIS DOOR,

08:11.931 --> 08:13.448
WE'RE GOING TO STAY
STRONG.

08:13.482 --> 08:15.068
I KNOW.

08:15.103 --> 08:19.172
I'M SO FRUSTRATED.

08:19.206 --> 08:23.724
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS

08:23.758 --> 08:24.310
ON THIS WEEK?

08:24.344 --> 08:26.724
I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

08:26.758 --> 08:29.896
LIKE, HERE IS THE THING,
ME AND BIG "D"

08:29.931 --> 08:32.896
DON'T HAVE A GREAT
PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP.

08:32.931 --> 08:35.103
NO.

08:35.137 --> 08:38.413
I COULD BEAT BIG "D" AT
ANYTHING.

08:38.448 --> 08:41.310
HE IS SOMEBODY I KNOW I
COULD KICK OUT LATER IF I

08:41.344 --> 08:42.275
NEED TO.

08:42.310 --> 08:47.103
BUT DON'T YOU THINK
THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE

08:47.137 --> 08:48.000
THINKS?

08:48.034 --> 08:49.586
SO YOU THINK HE WILL
KEEP SKATING BY?

08:49.620 --> 08:50.586
THAT'S MY FEAR.

08:50.620 --> 08:53.310
THEY'RE GOING TO BE
CONVINCED THEY CAN BEAT

08:53.344 --> 08:54.241
HIM.

08:54.275 --> 08:58.172
IF BIG "D" IS TAKING ONE
OF THOSE SPOTS IN

08:58.206 --> 09:00.413
EVERYONE'S MIND, THAT
MEANS THEY'RE NOT THINKING

09:00.448 --> 09:02.172
ABOUT TAKING ME TO THE
END.

09:02.206 --> 09:08.137
I WANT TO MAKE SURE MY END
GAME IS SET UP AS BEST AS

09:08.172 --> 09:13.206
POSSIBLE, AND FOR THAT I
NEED BIG DRC "D" TO GO THIS

09:13.241 --> 09:13.827
WEEK.

09:13.862 --> 09:15.206
I WANT TO PONDER THIS.

09:15.241 --> 09:17.413
I KIND OF FEEL LIKE
D.X. MIGHT BE PONDERING

09:17.448 --> 09:18.482
IT.

09:18.517 --> 09:22.103
CLAIRE IS MY GIRL, SO I
WEREN'T TO ENTERTAIN HER

09:22.137 --> 09:24.551
IDEAS.

09:24.586 --> 09:27.344
BUT THIS IDEA ABOUT
KEEPING BRITINI HAS TO BE

09:27.379 --> 09:31.586
SHOT DOWN AND IT WILL BE
SHOT DOWN.

09:31.620 --> 09:34.275
BECAUSE DEREK X. IS PART
OF THE COOKOUT AND HE IS

09:34.310 --> 09:35.310
NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

09:35.344 --> 09:39.655
YOU'RE SITTING HERE
EATING IN MY FACE AND YOU

09:39.689 --> 09:40.793
NEVER OFFERED ME A BITE.

09:40.827 --> 09:42.275
IT'S THE RUDEST THING.

09:42.310 --> 09:43.793
DO YOU WANT A BITE?

09:43.827 --> 09:45.103
NO.

09:45.137 --> 09:49.793
I'M OUTTA HERE.

09:49.827 --> 09:52.206
SO YOU WOULD TAKE OUT

09:52.241 --> 09:53.034
THE XAVIER OPTION?

09:53.068 --> 09:55.724
I WOULD PROBABLY TAKE
OUT BIG "D."

09:55.758 --> 09:59.724
I DON'T THINK YOU'D BE
ABLE TO TAKE OUT BIG "D."

09:59.758 --> 10:04.172
HE'S NOT ON THE BLOCK NEXT
TO ANYONE -- IF HE IS,

10:04.206 --> 10:07.482
THAT PERSON GOES HOME.

10:07.517 --> 10:09.517
WE SHOULD KEEP BRITINI.

10:09.551 --> 10:12.379
I KNOW, THE GUY IS NOT
GOING TO SIGN OFF.

10:12.413 --> 10:15.172
KEEPING BRITINI IN THIS
HOUSE IS NOT BAD AT ALL

10:15.206 --> 10:16.275
FOR OUR GAME.

10:16.310 --> 10:18.724
IT IS ACTUALLY GOOD FOR
OUR GAME BECAUSE SHE WOULD

10:18.758 --> 10:29.517
TAKE A SHOT AT KYLAND OR
DEREK X. OR ALYSSA.

10:29.551 --> 10:31.034
SHE WOULD BE A SHIELD FOR
US.

10:31.068 --> 10:35.586
HOW IN THE WORLD AM I
SUPPOSED TO COME UP WITH

10:35.620 --> 10:39.586
REBUTTALS TO DEREK X.'S
LOGIC BECAUSE HE IS MAKING

10:39.620 --> 10:40.551
SENSE.

10:40.586 --> 10:43.586
IF I WAS PLAYING THE
COOKOUT AND THIS

10:43.620 --> 10:50.862
INDIVIDUAL PLAN DIDN'T
EXIST, I WOULD BE GUNGHO

10:50.896 --> 10:53.275
FOR THIS PLAN.

10:53.310 --> 10:54.793
BUT IT IS TOO EARLY.

10:54.827 --> 11:00.344
IT IS TOO EARLY TO DRAW
A LINE.

11:00.379 --> 11:02.758
I THINK BRITINI SHOULD
STAY.

11:02.793 --> 11:07.862
I THINK SENDING DEREK
X HOME WILL BE THE BEST

11:07.896 --> 11:10.034
FOR MY PERSONAL CLOSE.

11:10.068 --> 11:18.000
ME AND AZAH ARE EXTREMELY
CLOSE AND HANNAH AND I

11:18.034 --> 11:19.172
WORK EXTREMELY CLOSE.

11:19.206 --> 11:23.482
IF A VOTE IS GOING TO
HAPPEN, IT WILL PROBABLY

11:23.517 --> 11:28.620
BE WITH THE FOUR OF US.

11:28.655 --> 11:28.965
SHE COULD TAKE SHOTS WE

11:31.172 --> 11:32.862
MIGHT BE A LITTLE MORE
SCARED TO TAKE.

11:32.896 --> 11:45.965
BUT I KNOW SHE WILL PUT
UP KYLAND AND BIG "D".

11:46.000 --> 11:51.206
.
IS HE REALLY GOING TO

11:51.241 --> 11:52.517
GO AFTER KYLAND?

11:52.551 --> 11:56.862
BIG "D" IS NOT
SHIELDING THEM.

11:56.896 --> 11:59.620
BRITINI COULD TAKE ONE OF
THOSE NOMINATION CHAIRS

11:59.655 --> 12:00.068
EVERY WEEK.

12:00.103 --> 12:02.103
SHE IS A SHIELD.

12:02.137 --> 12:02.931
SHE IS A WEAPON.

12:02.965 --> 12:06.000
SHE IS ALSO A PAWN.

12:06.034 --> 12:07.586
HONESTLY, SHE IS PERFECT.

12:07.620 --> 12:12.000
CLAIRE AND DER "X" WILL
JUST NOT LET THIS GO.

12:12.034 --> 12:17.275
BUT HANNAH AND I ARE NOT
GOING TO VOTE AGAINST

12:17.310 --> 12:18.310
DEREK X.

12:18.344 --> 12:22.862
IF THESE GUYS WILL NOT
STOP COMING OUT ABOUT THE

12:22.896 --> 12:25.344
COOKOUT, AS MUCH AS I LOVE
THEM, WE MIGHT HAVE TO GET

12:25.379 --> 12:29.448
RID OF THEM SOONER THAN
LATER.

12:29.482 --> 12:32.517
UP NEXT...THE
COOKOUT MUST CHOOSE

12:32.551 --> 12:35.965
BETWEEN KEEPING THEIR
FRIENDS OR TAKING THE

12:36.000 --> 12:38.517
FIRST SHOT.

12:38.551 --> 12:41.620
THEN...BRITINI OR DEREK
X., WHO WILL CLAIM THE

12:41.655 --> 12:42.827
DISTINCTION OF JUROR
NUMBER ONE?

12:42.862 --> 12:46.827
AND BY THE END OF THE
NIGHT, WE'LL CROWN A NEW

12:46.862 --> 12:47.965
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD LIVE.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.655
STAY WITH US.

13:03.620 --> 13:05.862
WELCOME BACK
TO "BIG BROTHER."

13:05.896 --> 13:09.655
AS THE NUMBERS DWINDLE,
THE COOKOUT KNOWS THEY

13:09.689 --> 13:11.034
MUST WIN TONIGHT'S H.O.H.

13:11.068 --> 13:17.413
OR RISK BEING EXPOSED.

13:17.620 --> 13:20.034
TELL ME WHAT YOUR PLAN
IS.

13:20.068 --> 13:22.275
UM, I HAVE AN IDEA.

13:22.310 --> 13:24.724
I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST

13:24.758 --> 13:25.448
COURSE OF ACTION.

13:25.482 --> 13:26.379
DO YOU HAVE A PLAN?

13:26.413 --> 13:29.034
YES.

13:29.068 --> 13:35.034
OKAY.

13:35.068 --> 13:42.344
CLAIRE, MAYBE?

13:42.379 --> 13:43.413
THEY NEED TO GO.

13:43.448 --> 13:44.586
THEY DO.

13:44.620 --> 13:47.000
THAT'S WHY ONE OF THEM HAS
TO GO.

13:47.034 --> 13:50.862
I LOVE CLAIRE AND DEREK
X., BUT THE COOKOUT IS A

13:50.896 --> 13:55.000
PRIORITY FOR ME.

13:55.034 --> 13:58.172
THEY ARE BOTH VERY SMART
PLAYERS.

13:58.206 --> 14:03.310
AND I COULD SEE THEM
FIGURING OUT THE COOKOUT

14:03.344 --> 14:04.586
IF THEY'RE HERE TOO LONG.

14:04.620 --> 14:07.586
I WOULD BE REALLY SAD TO
LOSE EITHER ONE OF THEM,

14:07.620 --> 14:11.965
BUT FOR THE SAKE OF THE
COOKOUT, IF I HAVE TO LOSE

14:12.000 --> 14:15.931
EITHER CLAIRE OR DEREK X.,
I HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT.

14:15.965 --> 14:19.931
MAYBE CLAIRE IS
GOING -- OKAY.

14:19.965 --> 14:23.896
THAT MEANS I NEED TO GO
FOR THE H.O.H. HEART.

14:23.931 --> 14:24.655
GOT IT.

14:24.689 --> 14:28.931
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

14:28.965 --> 14:30.827
ARE THERE ANY WHITE

14:30.862 --> 14:31.931
MALES IN THE GAME?

14:31.965 --> 14:33.827
OKAY.

14:33.862 --> 14:35.034
THERE IS NOT.

14:35.068 --> 14:41.034
HAS THIS EVER HAPPENED
IN HISTORY, NOT A SINGLE

14:41.068 --> 14:43.551
WHITE MALE IN THE HISTORY?

14:43.586 --> 14:44.103
I DON'T KNOW.

14:44.137 --> 14:47.896
WOW, THAT'S CRAZY.

14:47.931 --> 14:58.137
IF THEY GET IN JERSEY,
THEY'LL BE LION, LIKE, NOTICE

14:58.172 --> 15:01.206
THERE IS ONLY BLACK PEOPLE
IN THE HOUSE?

15:01.241 --> 15:02.758
AND I'LL BE, LIKE, WE DID
IT.

15:02.793 --> 15:07.206
I FIGURED WITH BABY "D," I
DON'T KNOW IF HE WOULD

15:07.241 --> 15:10.172
WANT TO WIN THAT H.O.H.,
WHICH WOULD BE GOOD.

15:10.206 --> 15:11.034
I MEANT TO MENTION IT TO
HIM, HEY, DO YOU THINK IT

15:11.068 --> 15:14.000
IS WORTH IT ALL FOR US TO
SIT DOWN?

15:14.034 --> 15:16.827
IF THAT DOES HAPPEN, WE
MAY GET IN THE SITUATION

15:16.862 --> 15:19.620
WHERE MAYBE IT IS BEST FOR
ME TO WIN.

15:19.655 --> 15:21.137
HE DOESN'T NEED TO WIN.

15:21.172 --> 15:24.103
RIGHT NOW DEREK X. IS
THE BIGGEST KIND OF KNOWN

15:24.137 --> 15:30.034
THREAT IN THE HOUSE, NOT
ONLY TO MY PERSONAL GAME,

15:30.068 --> 15:33.793
BUT ALSO TO THE COOKOUT AS
A WHOLE.

15:33.827 --> 15:38.448
IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT
DEREK AND I GET HIM

15:38.482 --> 15:40.517
CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO THROW
THIS NEXT COMPETITION.

15:40.551 --> 15:43.689
IT WOULD BE REALLY EASY
FOR ANYBODY WHO REALLY

15:43.724 --> 15:45.620
WINS TO PUT UP THE
REMAINING TWO PEOPLE.

15:45.655 --> 15:49.310
PARTICULARLY FOR ONE,
TWO, OR THREE, WE CAN SEND

15:49.344 --> 15:50.689
ANYBODY GOING HOME.

15:50.724 --> 15:54.413
ESPECIALLY WITH NEXT
WEEK, THERE IS A DECENT

15:54.448 --> 16:00.206
LOOKLIKELIHOOD FOR THEM TO WIN
AND OBVIOUSLY I CAN'T

16:00.241 --> 16:01.068
PLAY.

16:01.103 --> 16:03.586
YOU HAVE YOUR
MOTIVATION NOT TO WIN

16:03.620 --> 16:06.379
BECAUSE THEN WE WOULD
CONTINUE THE 100% OF

16:06.413 --> 16:08.275
H.O.H.s BEING IN THIS
ROOM.

16:08.310 --> 16:11.655
BIG "D," YOU HAVEN'T
SAID MUCH.

16:11.689 --> 16:13.000
WHAT IS ON YOUR MIND?

16:13.034 --> 16:15.793
PRETTY MUCH THE EXACT
THING YOU JUST BROUGHT UP.

16:15.827 --> 16:19.137
ME, "X," AND KYLAND
ALMOST HAVE TO KEEP EACH

16:19.172 --> 16:20.241
OTHER IN THE HOUSE.

16:20.275 --> 16:22.517
IF ONE OF US GOES, THAT
LEAVES TWO STRONG GUYS,

16:22.551 --> 16:27.517
AND IT IS VERY EASY FOR
THEM TO GET PICKED OFF ONE

16:27.551 --> 16:28.655
BY ONE.

16:28.689 --> 16:32.448
I THINK IT IS EASIER IF
EITHER MYSELF OR ALYSSA

16:32.482 --> 16:35.103
WON, THEN YOU WOULDN'T GO
UP.

16:35.137 --> 16:38.241
I KNOW IF I WIN H.O.H.,
THAT WOULD BE A TIME THAT

16:38.275 --> 16:41.241
I WOULD WANT TO -- WE
WOULD HAVE TO SHOW, LIKE,

16:41.275 --> 16:43.896
OUR TRUST WITH ONE
ANOTHER, MOVING FORWARD AS

16:43.931 --> 16:45.068
A SOLID FOUNDATION.

16:45.103 --> 16:47.482
I THINK THAT COULD HAPPEN
NEXT WEEK.

16:47.517 --> 16:51.551
NOW I'M TRYING TO
THINK, DAMN, I MIGHT EVEN

16:51.586 --> 16:52.620
THROW IT TO YOU.

16:52.655 --> 16:55.517
IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL
BETTER, I'LL LITERALLY GO

16:55.551 --> 16:56.517
FOR IT.

16:56.551 --> 17:00.896
AND THEN YOU WILL KNOW YOU
AND HANNAH ARE GOOD.

17:00.931 --> 17:04.413
IF DEREK X. THROWS ME
THIS NEXT H.O.H.

17:04.448 --> 17:07.551
COMPETITION, HE WILL BE
SEALING HIS FATE IN THIS

17:07.586 --> 17:10.689
GAME.

17:16.724 --> 17:21.758
IF SOMEONE SAYS THEY'RE

17:21.793 --> 17:25.310
NOT GOING TO PUT YOU UP,
THAT JUST MEANS THEY'RE

17:25.344 --> 17:30.586
NOT GOING TO PUT YOU UP
FOR, LIKE, THE FIRST TWO

17:30.620 --> 17:31.206
NOMS.

17:31.241 --> 17:36.931
I DON'T REALLY SEE D.X.

17:36.965 --> 17:40.103
AND X. WORKING THAT
TIGHTLY IN THIS GAME.

17:40.137 --> 17:42.586
PEOPLE WILL SAY, DON'T
WORRY, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO

17:42.620 --> 17:46.551
GO ON THE BLOCK.

17:46.586 --> 17:47.655
UH-UH, UH-UH.

17:47.689 --> 17:50.034
YOU HAVE TO LIE TO PEOPLE
TO WATCH OUT FOR YOUR BACK

17:50.068 --> 17:51.000
FOR THE NEXT WEEK.

17:51.034 --> 17:52.517
YOU CAN NEVER TRUST IT.

17:52.551 --> 17:57.931
EVERYONE IS TELLING YOU
SOMETHING FOR A REASON.

17:57.965 --> 17:59.517
I SEE WHERE THIS IS

17:59.551 --> 18:01.000
GOING, 100%.

18:01.034 --> 18:04.689
YOU CAN NEVER TRUST
ANYONE.

18:04.724 --> 18:10.689
WE'RE SAYING THIS SO
THEY WILL TAKE A SHOT.

18:10.724 --> 18:14.827
COMING

18:14.862 --> 18:17.517
UP...BRITINI OR DEREK F.,
THE LIVE VOTE AND EVICTION

18:17.551 --> 18:18.551
NEXT.

18:18.586 --> 18:19.344
STAY WITH US.

18:34.689 --> 18:36.275
WELCOME BACK
TO "BIG BROTHER."

18:36.310 --> 18:40.103
BRITINI OR DEREK F., WHO
WILL BE TRADING IN THE

18:40.137 --> 18:42.034
"BIG BROTHER" HOUSE FOR
THE JURY HOUSE.

18:42.068 --> 18:46.344
LET'S HEAD TO THE LIVING
ROOM AND TALK TO THE TWO

18:46.379 --> 18:46.896
NOMINEES.

18:46.931 --> 18:47.827
HELLO, HOUSEGUESTS.

18:47.862 --> 18:51.448
IT IS TIME FOR THE LIVE
VOTE AND EVICTION.

18:51.482 --> 18:56.034
BRITINI, DEREK -- DERRICK,
MAY I PLEASE CALL YOU BIG

18:56.068 --> 18:56.413
"D"?

18:56.448 --> 18:57.103
YOU CAN.

18:57.137 --> 18:59.241
THANK YOU, BIG
"D."

18:59.275 --> 19:09.793
THAT MEANS I HAVE TO CULE CALL
BRITINI, BRITTITI.

19:09.827 --> 19:12.793
IN MOMENTS YOUR HOUSEMATES
WILL COST THEIR VOTES TO

19:12.827 --> 19:15.034
EVICTION LIVE, BUT BEFORE
THEY DO, YOU EACH HAVE A

19:15.068 --> 19:18.620
FINAL CHANCE TO SWAY THEIR
VOTES WITH ONE BRIEF

19:18.655 --> 19:19.241
STATEMENT.

19:19.275 --> 19:20.620
BRITINI, YOU'RE UP FIRST.

19:20.655 --> 19:23.275
THANK YOU, JULIE CHEN,
YOU QUEEN.

19:23.310 --> 19:24.068
HELLO, EVERYONE.

19:24.103 --> 19:26.620
HERE WE GO ON THE BLOCK,
WEEK FOUR.

19:26.655 --> 19:29.034
I REALLY THOUGHT I SHUT
THAT DOOR.

19:29.068 --> 19:31.655
A SHOUT OUT TO MY FANS, I
LOVE YOU ALL.

19:31.689 --> 19:34.689
YOU HAVE TO KEEP MY
FASHION ON THIS WALL.

19:34.724 --> 19:36.172
HOUSEGUESTS, LET'S GET
DOWN TO BUSINESS.

19:36.206 --> 19:42.000
DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'RE
VOTING -- THAT'S ALL I

19:42.034 --> 19:42.965
MADE UP.

19:43.000 --> 19:48.137
IF YOU FEEL LIKE I -- I
WOULD REALLY, REALLY

19:48.172 --> 19:49.655
APPRECIATE IF YOU WOULD
VOTE FOR ME.

19:49.689 --> 19:53.413
IF YOU FEEL LIKE I
ADVANCED IT, AND HELPED

19:53.448 --> 19:59.241
YOUR GAME MOVE FORWARD,
PLEASE VOTE FOR ME.

19:59.275 --> 20:01.310
I RESPECT WHATEVER
DECISION YOU MAKE.

20:01.344 --> 20:02.551
I LOVE YOU, JULIE CHEN.

20:02.586 --> 20:04.689
I LOVE YOU,
TOO.

20:04.724 --> 20:05.758
I LOVE YOU ALL.

20:05.793 --> 20:07.310
YOU'RE ALL MY CHILDREN IN
THERE.

20:07.344 --> 20:08.586
YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.

20:08.620 --> 20:12.689
THANK YOU, JULIE.

20:12.724 --> 20:16.241
I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO
GOD AND THANK YOU TO MY

20:16.275 --> 20:17.241
MOTHER.

20:17.275 --> 20:20.586
SHE STILL TAKES CARE OF ME
TODAY, EVEN WHEN SHE

20:20.620 --> 20:21.586
STRUGGLES.

20:21.620 --> 20:26.724
AND CHECK OUT THE SHOW OF
MY BEST FRIEND ADAM.

20:26.758 --> 20:33.862
HOUSEGUESTS, IF YOU WANT
TO CONTINUE HAVING YOUR

20:33.896 --> 20:36.482
STOMACHS FULL OF FOOD AND
LIVING IN A CLEANER

20:36.517 --> 20:37.965
ENVIRONMENT, THEN YOU WILL
KEEP ME HERE.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.137
THAT'S ALL I GOT FOR YOU,
BABY.

20:40.172 --> 20:42.310
THANK YOU
BOTH.

20:42.344 --> 20:43.379
ALL RIGHT.

20:43.413 --> 20:45.275
EVERYONE, HOUSEGUESTS, IT
IS NOW TIME FOR THE LIVE

20:45.310 --> 20:46.448
VOTING TO BEGIN.

20:46.482 --> 20:48.655
AS ALWAYS, THE TWO
NOMINEES ARE NOT ALLOWED

20:48.689 --> 20:50.103
TO VOTE.

20:50.137 --> 20:53.689
KYLAND, AS CURRENT HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD, YOU WILL ONLY

20:53.724 --> 20:55.758
VOTE IN THE EVENT OF A
TIE.

20:55.793 --> 20:59.310
ONE AT A TIME, THE REST OF
YOU WILL ENTER THE DIARY

20:59.344 --> 21:02.413
ROOM AND CAST YOUR VOTE TO
EVICT.

21:02.448 --> 21:04.241
XAVIER, YOU'RE UP FIRST.

21:04.275 --> 21:14.172
PLEASE GO TO THE DIARY
ROOM.

21:14.206 --> 21:16.482
XAVIER STANDS FIRMLY WITH
THE COOKOUT.

21:16.517 --> 21:22.482
HE SHOULD STAND BY HIS
ALLY, BIG "D."

21:22.517 --> 21:23.206
HI, XAVIER.

21:23.241 --> 21:24.103
PLEASE CAST YOUR VOTE TO
EVICT.

21:24.137 --> 21:26.793
I VOTE TO EVICT
BRITINI.

21:26.827 --> 21:31.965
THANK YOU.

21:32.000 --> 21:37.413
AS A MEMBER OF
THE COOKOUT, HANNAH'S

21:37.448 --> 21:41.724
TARGET IS BRITINI, BUT HER
ALLY, DEREK X., WANTS TO

21:41.758 --> 21:42.448
KEEP BRITINI.

21:42.482 --> 21:44.586
WHO WILL SHE VOTE OUT.

21:44.620 --> 21:46.206
HELLO, HANNAH.

21:46.241 --> 21:47.379
HI, JULIE CHEN.

21:47.413 --> 21:49.379
PLEASE CAST
YOUR VOTE TO EVICT.

21:49.413 --> 21:55.379
WITH A GREAT AMOUNT OF
SADNESS, I VOTE TO EVICT

21:55.413 --> 21:55.724
BRITINI.

21:55.758 --> 21:56.724
THANK YOU.

21:56.758 --> 21:58.551
CLAIRE IS
WORRIED THAT BIG "D" WILL

21:58.586 --> 22:01.655
FLOAT TO THE END, AND SHE
HAS MADE IT KNOWN THIS MAY

22:01.689 --> 22:04.620
BE THE TIME TO TAKE HIM
OUT.

22:04.655 --> 22:06.724
HELLO, CLAIRE.

22:06.758 --> 22:07.931
SALUTATIONS, JULIE.

22:07.965 --> 22:11.241
I VOTE TO EVICT BRITINI.

22:11.275 --> 22:14.586
THANK YOU.

22:14.620 --> 22:19.103
D.J. AND MALISE, A
SHOUTOUT TO YOU.

22:19.137 --> 22:22.275
DEREK X. KNOWS
THAT KEEPING BRITINI COULD

22:22.310 --> 22:23.620
BE VALUABLE TO HIS GAME.

22:23.655 --> 22:24.965
IS IT ENOUGH TO SEND BIG
"D" PACKING.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.034
HELLO, DEREK.

22:26.068 --> 22:27.551
PLEASE CAST YOUR VOTE TO
EVICT.

22:27.586 --> 22:32.586
I VOTE TO EVICT
BRITINI.

22:32.620 --> 22:35.241
SHOUTOUT TO TAYLOR.

22:35.275 --> 22:37.827
AZAH IS VERY
CLOSE WITH BRITINI, BUT

22:37.862 --> 22:42.551
SHE IS A MEMBER OF THE
COOKOUT WITH BIG "D."

22:42.586 --> 22:44.586
WHERE WILL HER VOTE FALL.

22:44.620 --> 22:47.172
PLEASE CAST YOUR VOTE TO
EVICT.

22:47.206 --> 22:53.379
I VOTE EVICT BIG "D."

22:53.413 --> 22:54.034
LOVE YOU.

22:54.068 --> 22:55.103
THANK YOU.

22:55.137 --> 22:59.793
TIFFANY IS NOT THE BIGGEST

ONE-ON-ONE WITH JUROR

26:28.413 --> 26:30.034
NUMBER ONE, BRITINI.

26:30.068 --> 26:32.172
AND THEN IT IS TIME TO
CROWN NEW HEAD OF

26:32.206 --> 26:32.620
HOUSEHOLD.

26:32.655 --> 26:33.344
STAY WITH US.

26:46.241 --> 26:47.620
WELCOME BACK
TO "BIG BROTHER."

26:47.655 --> 26:49.965
I'M SITTING HERE WITH
BRITINI, WHO WAS JUST

26:50.000 --> 26:52.206
EVICTED BY A VOTE OF 7-1.

26:52.241 --> 26:53.931
THAT'S RIGHT.

26:53.965 --> 26:57.068
BRITINI, YOU
WERE ON THE BLOCK FOUR OUT

26:57.103 --> 26:58.758
OF SIX WEEKS.

26:58.793 --> 27:02.275
MOSTLY YOU WERE TOLD,
LISTEN, YOU'RE JUST THE

27:02.310 --> 27:03.241
PAWN.

27:03.275 --> 27:04.275
OBVIOUSLY NOT THIS WEEK
BCAUSE WE'RE SITTING

27:04.310 --> 27:05.275
HERE.

27:05.310 --> 27:08.206
WHY DO YOU THINK YOUR
HOUSEMATES CHOSE NOW TO

27:08.241 --> 27:09.241
EVICT YOU?

27:09.275 --> 27:12.000
YEAH, I THINK GOING
INTO JURY IT IS DEFINITELY

27:12.034 --> 27:14.931
A CONVERSATION OF WHO YOU
THINK YOU CAN BEATJIN THE

27:14.965 --> 27:15.931
FINAL TWO.

27:15.965 --> 27:19.068
AND WITH THE UNDERDOG
STORY THAT I HAVE, I WAS

27:19.103 --> 27:21.206
GOING TO HAVE A REALLY
GREAT STORY IF I MADE IT

27:21.241 --> 27:29.896
TO THE END, AND YOU THEY
WANTED TO GET GET ME OUT.

27:29.931 --> 27:32.551
SO DO YOU TAKE
THAT AS A COMPLIMENT?

27:32.586 --> 27:33.551
YEAH.

27:33.586 --> 27:37.034
I KNEW MY STORY WAS SO
DIFFERENT FROM EVERYONE

27:37.068 --> 27:40.206
ELSE IN THE HOUSE.

27:40.241 --> 27:44.172
I SPENT THE MOST TIME ON
THE BLOCK.

27:44.206 --> 27:45.206
HONESTLY, I'M HONORED.

27:45.241 --> 27:46.137
IN ADDITION TO
THAT, AMERICA ALSO VOTED

27:46.172 --> 27:49.103
YOU IN THE HIGHEST
CATEGORY OF GETTING B.B.

27:49.137 --> 27:49.482
BUCKS.

27:49.517 --> 27:50.517
THEY DID.

27:50.551 --> 27:57.931
YOU GOT $100
IN B.B. BUCKS TO PLAY THE

27:57.965 --> 27:59.793
HIGH-ROLLER'S GAME BUT YOU
DIDN'T PLAY.

27:59.827 --> 28:00.758
WHY NOT?

28:00.793 --> 28:04.344
I WANTED TO SAVE IT FOR
THE ROULETTE DEAL.

28:04.379 --> 28:10.344
AND I WANTED TO SAVE MY
MONEY FOR THE DEAL THAT

28:10.379 --> 28:12.172
KYLAND MADE.

28:12.206 --> 28:14.655
THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T USE IT
AND WANTED TO SAVE THEM.

28:14.689 --> 28:16.517
OUT OF
EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE,

28:16.551 --> 28:19.517
DOES THAT MEAN YOU FEEL
ONLY BETRAYED BY KYLAND --

28:19.551 --> 28:21.758
OH, NO.

28:21.793 --> 28:22.827
ABSOLUTELY.

28:22.862 --> 28:25.689
I FEEL AT THE END OF THE
DAY, THIS IS A GAME AND I

28:25.724 --> 28:26.724
UNDERSTAND THAT.

28:26.758 --> 28:30.241
I DEFINITELY FEEL BETRAYED
BY SOME MEMBERS OF THE

28:30.275 --> 28:30.793
HOUSE.

28:30.827 --> 28:32.068
FOR EXAMPLE?

28:32.103 --> 28:34.310
CLAIRE AND TIFFANY.

28:34.344 --> 28:38.310
I KNOW CLAIRE WAS REALLY
TRYING TO FIGHT FOR ME

28:38.344 --> 28:39.103
THIS WEEK.

28:39.137 --> 28:40.896
TIFFANY, NOT AS MUCH, TO
BE HONEST.

28:40.931 --> 28:44.241
SOME PEOPLE REALLY STEPPED
IT UP FOR ME, AND SOME

28:44.275 --> 28:47.241
PEOPLE REALLY TOOK A BACK
SEAT, WHICH I WAS REALLY

28:47.275 --> 28:48.206
SURPRISED AT.

28:48.241 --> 28:52.758
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
THIS IS A GAME, AND I

28:52.793 --> 28:55.310
COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND NO
ONE WANTING TO SHOW CARDS,

28:55.344 --> 28:57.206
BUT I THINK PEOPLE ARE
PLAYING SCARED.

28:57.241 --> 28:59.413
I'M CURIOUS TO SEE WHEN
MOVES ARE GOING TO START

28:59.448 --> 29:00.448
HAPPENING.

29:00.482 --> 29:02.241
OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE YOU'RE ON THE

29:02.275 --> 29:04.724
JURY, I CAN'T CONFIRM AND
SHOW YOU ANYTHING.

29:04.758 --> 29:06.689
BUT I CAN SHOW YOU YOUR
GOOD-BYE MESSAGES.

29:06.724 --> 29:09.586
OH, YES, PLEASE!

29:09.620 --> 29:11.482

29:20.379 --> 29:23.448

29:23.482 --> 29:28.034
BRIT-BRIT, YOU FOUGHT
THE BIG FIGHT.

29:28.068 --> 29:31.413
YOU'RE A BIG BURST OF
SUNSHINE, AND THAT

29:31.448 --> 29:33.482
DEFINITELY WILL BE MISSED.

29:33.517 --> 29:34.413

29:43.275 --> 29:45.310
UNFORTUNATELY IN THE GROUP

29:45.344 --> 29:48.517
DIDN'T SEE THAT YOU SHOULD
STAY THIS WEEK.
