WEBVTT

00:00.023 --> 00:02.992
Carrie, wait a second.
I thought you'd like to meet Magnum.

00:03.026 --> 00:04.254
My new baby-sitter.

00:04.294 --> 00:06.854
You don't get to the top in this game
unless you want it.

00:08.965 --> 00:10.830
Step into the backhand!

00:10.867 --> 00:14.769
You're suggesting we bet on
the outcome of the mixed doubles?

00:14.804 --> 00:17.932
- Thomas Sullivan Magnum.
- Ginger Lee Grant.

00:17.974 --> 00:19.134
Oh!

00:19.175 --> 00:21.700
A witch! I told you she was a witch!

00:21.744 --> 00:23.974
I hate to lose more than anything.

00:24.147 --> 00:26.047
- Carrie.
- Magnum.

00:26.082 --> 00:29.882
My God, man, have you
completely lost your mind?

02:06.616 --> 02:11.053
She's gonna be good in this one, Phyllis.
Damn good.

02:11.087 --> 02:13.817
Better than that. She's gonna win this one.

02:59.869 --> 03:02.633
Aaargh! I'm sorry, Rick.

03:02.672 --> 03:04.640
I'm a little rusty on the serve.

03:04.674 --> 03:06.835
I got to get it up a little more.

03:06.876 --> 03:09.208
But when I do, it'll be a monster.

03:09.245 --> 03:11.042
Not with that follow-through.

03:11.080 --> 03:13.708
- What's wrong with it?
- You need more extension.

03:13.749 --> 03:15.740
- I do?
- Mm-hm.

03:15.785 --> 03:19.448
Try and keep this one on the court.
We're running out of balls.

03:19.489 --> 03:24.222
OK. This one will be in, Rick.
I promise. It'll be just perfect.

03:26.028 --> 03:28.019
- Magnum!
- Uhh!

03:33.936 --> 03:35.927
Good God.

03:35.972 --> 03:39.533
That is undoubtedly the most
wretched serve ever seen on this court.

03:40.643 --> 03:44.977
To think that Rod Laver and
John Newcombe once graced this surface.

03:45.014 --> 03:48.472
It's a sacrilege even walking on it,
much less attempting to play.

03:48.518 --> 03:50.713
We weren't playing, we were practicing.

03:50.753 --> 03:54.883
In two days you'll be participating
in Robin Masters' Pro-Am Tournament.

03:54.924 --> 03:57.358
Come on, that's supposed to be fun.

03:57.393 --> 04:00.658
Fun? Magnum, the tournament
is going to be televised.

04:00.696 --> 04:03.529
Hey, you got a point there, Higgie baby.

04:03.566 --> 04:06.262
This is serious business.

04:06.302 --> 04:09.738
Precisely. Which is
one of the reasons I'm here.

04:09.772 --> 04:15.210
I'm prepared to offer my services as coach
so you'll not embarrass Robin, or yourself.

04:15.244 --> 04:18.303
Oh, gee, thanks, Higgins, but...

04:18.346 --> 04:20.178
I already got a coach.

04:20.216 --> 04:23.208
Besides, I think the game has changed a bit

04:23.252 --> 04:27.552
- since the days of knickers and straw hats.
- Oh, really?

04:27.590 --> 04:32.220
I'll have you know, I was one of the finest
tennis players in Her Majesty's Service.

04:32.261 --> 04:35.856
During the war, I played the top seed
in the American army.

04:35.898 --> 04:37.525
Tappy Larsen?

04:38.334 --> 04:42.031
- You've heard of Tappy Larsen?
- Sure. Hasn't everybody?

04:42.071 --> 04:43.868
Did you ever play Gardnar Mulloy?

04:43.906 --> 04:46.898
No. Gardnar was transferred
to the Pacific Theatre

04:46.943 --> 04:50.037
when I parachuted into
the Urals with a demolition team.

04:50.079 --> 04:52.809
- We were to infiltrate the German lines...
- Guys.

04:52.848 --> 04:58.309
I hate to break this up but we are the Am part
of Pro-Am and we have to practice.

04:58.354 --> 05:01.380
Obviously. That serve of yours
is truly abysmal.

05:02.491 --> 05:06.450
Whoa, whoa! Wait till he gets it going.
He says it'll be a... a monster.

05:06.495 --> 05:07.484
Right, coach.

05:07.530 --> 05:10.988
Higgins, might you be able
to help me with my serve?

05:12.768 --> 05:15.896
Certainly, Rick. I'd be delighted.

05:15.938 --> 05:18.998
You are paired with Zora Korcek
in the mixed doubles.

05:19.041 --> 05:22.738
- The Zora Korcek from Czechoslovakia?
- None other.

05:22.778 --> 05:24.507
- Who's he got?
- Ginger...

05:24.547 --> 05:26.344
Carrie Reardon.

05:27.817 --> 05:30.752
Higgins, you said that was all set up.

05:30.786 --> 05:33.277
Yes. Well, there's been a change of plans.

05:33.322 --> 05:36.621
But I was counting on that.
I was looking forward to it. She's...

05:36.659 --> 05:39.651
The best women's player in the world.
Out of your class.

05:39.695 --> 05:42.255
Yeah? Well, she's also an old friend.

05:42.298 --> 05:44.357
You know Ginger Grant?

05:45.334 --> 05:48.565
We go back to when I was at Annapolis
with her brother, Jim.

05:48.604 --> 05:51.129
- Perhaps we...
- Excuse me a minute. And?

05:51.173 --> 05:53.334
I don't want to get into it, Rick.

05:54.677 --> 05:57.805
It all started in my second year
at the Academy.

05:58.681 --> 06:01.013
Jim and I, we got this weekend pass.

06:01.050 --> 06:05.714
We drove all the way to Washington for
a double date with his girlfriend and Ginger.

06:05.755 --> 06:07.552
It was really something.

06:08.491 --> 06:10.482
We went to the drive-in.

06:10.593 --> 06:14.188
We saw Creature From The Black Lagoon
in my '54 DeSoto.

06:15.598 --> 06:17.691
And I remember...

06:17.967 --> 06:20.663
- Right at the scary part, Ginger...
- Magnum...

06:20.703 --> 06:23.228
- She just... Ginger just...
- Magnum!

06:24.473 --> 06:27.271
My God, you do have a tendency to rattle on.

06:27.843 --> 06:30.903
Despite your past,
you will not be playing with Miss Grant.

06:30.946 --> 06:33.141
- Why not?
- You're undoubtedly aware

06:33.182 --> 06:36.379
that young Miss Reardon
has been harassed on the tour.

06:36.419 --> 06:40.617
Mr. Masters has invited her and her mother
to stay during the tournament.

06:40.656 --> 06:43.489
- And?
- He'd like you to keep an eye on Carrie

06:43.526 --> 06:45.790
- while she's here.
- I knew it!

06:45.828 --> 06:48.854
That's why you paired me with her,
to be her baby-sitter.

06:48.898 --> 06:51.696
Call it what you may. I didn't do it.

06:51.734 --> 06:53.725
Mr. Masters did.

06:53.769 --> 06:55.760
Free rent.

06:55.805 --> 06:57.534
Red Ferrari.

06:59.041 --> 07:00.838
I thought that would silence you.

07:00.876 --> 07:04.243
Rick, allow me to demonstrate
a service technique I perfected

07:04.280 --> 07:06.646
while preparing Don Budge for Wimbledon.

07:06.682 --> 07:10.140
Magnum, would you mind
trying to return the service?

07:10.186 --> 07:14.850
Mind? Not at all, old chap. Mind?

07:20.262 --> 07:22.560
Ready?

07:24.400 --> 07:25.799
Ready.

07:35.745 --> 07:40.079
Believe me, Mr. Magnum, being tour
coordinator three years in a row is tough,

07:40.116 --> 07:43.085
but when your star player is intimidated...

07:43.119 --> 07:45.314
- Mr. Mills, I thought...
- Ronald.

07:45.354 --> 07:48.380
Ronald, I thought Carrie
was the one being intimidated.

07:48.424 --> 07:50.221
Well, she is.

07:50.259 --> 07:54.423
Oh, yes, of course, but Ginger,
she's our top female seed.

07:54.463 --> 07:57.557
Do you have
any idea who's behind these pranks?

07:57.600 --> 08:01.263
Not really. A lot of people on the tour
just don't care for Carrie.

08:01.303 --> 08:04.204
Some of them are jealous of her abilities,
like Ginger.

08:04.240 --> 08:09.268
It's only natural. Ginger's at the peak
of her career, Carrie's just starting out.

08:09.311 --> 08:11.779
But there are others, and not all are women.

08:11.814 --> 08:15.910
But Carrie goes through the top ten seeds
like a Saturday night DJ.

08:15.951 --> 08:19.580
Plays the record once or twice
then throws it away.

08:24.326 --> 08:28.786
- She is an exquisite athlete, isn't she?
- You bet.

08:30.900 --> 08:35.462
<i>Seeing Ginger for the first time in 16 years
brought back a flood of memories,</i>

08:35.504 --> 08:37.631
<i>some of which I'd forgotten I'd had</i>.

08:38.474 --> 08:40.567
<i>Even though a lot of time had passed,</i>

08:40.609 --> 08:45.478
<i>watching Ginger play, she still had something
Carrie Reardon never would.</i>

08:45.514 --> 08:47.505
<i>Style</i>.

08:53.889 --> 08:56.289
Damn it. Mother!

08:58.861 --> 09:02.194
She's doing it again.
Trying to hurt the ankle.

09:02.231 --> 09:04.290
Backhand a <i>ft</i> er backhand.

09:04.333 --> 09:06.824
She wants me
to put weight on it and hurt it again.

09:06.869 --> 09:11.203
- Come on, lass, take it easy.
- No. Everyone knows I had ankle surgery!

09:11.240 --> 09:14.607
You've had enough for one day.
Go inside, take a shower.

09:14.643 --> 09:19.342
- We'll talk about it later.
- That's the only way that old witch can win.

09:19.381 --> 09:21.645
- And she knows it.
- Carrie, go inside.

09:22.718 --> 09:24.709
Witch!

09:26.789 --> 09:30.190
- Carrie. Carrie, wait a second.
- What? What?

09:30.226 --> 09:34.356
I thought you'd like to meet Thomas Magnum,
your partner for mixed doubles.

09:34.396 --> 09:36.387
I know. My new baby-sitter.

09:37.299 --> 09:40.359
I hope you're better
than the last one they got me.

09:42.404 --> 09:45.464
- Carrie, I want to talk to you.
- She's under pressure.

09:45.508 --> 09:48.136
I'll talk to her mother. I'll be back in a minute.

09:48.177 --> 09:50.907
Take your time. I'll say hello to Ginger.

09:50.946 --> 09:53.244
- You know Ginger?
- Once.

10:13.068 --> 10:16.231
Midshipman Thomas Sullivan Magnum.

10:16.272 --> 10:18.866
- Ginger Lee Grant.
- I dropped the Lee.

10:19.942 --> 10:22.035
I dropped the Midshipman.

10:22.077 --> 10:23.908
- I don't believe it.
- Believe it.

10:24.613 --> 10:26.808
Oh! A <i>ft</i> er 16 years, I can't.

10:26.849 --> 10:28.840
- Oh!
- Aah!

10:29.685 --> 10:31.949
Oh.

10:31.987 --> 10:35.445
Now I believe it. What are you doing
in the middle of the Pacific

10:35.491 --> 10:37.288
at the King Kamehameha Club?

10:37.326 --> 10:40.386
- I'm baby-sitting.
- Baby-sitting?

10:41.564 --> 10:43.555
How touching. Who is he?

10:44.233 --> 10:46.667
Oh, it's Thomas Magnum, Mrs. Reardon.

10:46.702 --> 10:49.899
He's acting as bodyguard
during your stay at Robin's Nest.

10:49.939 --> 10:53.238
Looks like
he's guarding the wrong body.

10:55.244 --> 10:57.804
Listen, I've taken enough from you!

10:57.846 --> 11:01.043
- Get yourself another clown!
- I already have!

11:04.019 --> 11:06.613
- Isn't that...?
- Kenny Phelps.

11:06.655 --> 11:10.887
- Ranked number three in the world.
- Right. The guy with the temper.

11:29.979 --> 11:32.573
A witch! I told you she was a witch!

11:44.195 --> 11:48.097
I'm holding you personally responsible
for this reprehensible act.

11:48.128 --> 11:50.961
- Of course.
- You were supposed to be watching her.

11:50.998 --> 11:56.334
I was just introduced to her when she ran into
the women's locker room, screaming.

11:56.370 --> 11:58.133
Was I supposed to follow her?

11:58.172 --> 12:01.767
- That's not the point.
- That is precisely the point.

12:02.776 --> 12:07.110
- This thing does look like Carrie.
- It's a Carrie Reardon doll.

12:09.316 --> 12:13.116
I'm sorry, Higgins. I know this is serious.
I shouldn't be laughing.

12:13.153 --> 12:17.681
Dolls, coloring books, a video game
and a line of designer clothing.

12:17.725 --> 12:19.920
Carrie Reardon is a growth industry.

12:19.960 --> 12:22.428
What more could an 18-year-old want?

12:23.597 --> 12:26.327
To be the best tennis player in the world.

12:26.367 --> 12:29.598
I won't stand idly by
while a lunatic like Ginger Grant

12:29.637 --> 12:32.401
tries to take that from Carrie
by psyching her out.

12:32.439 --> 12:36.307
- Every week it's something else.
- Ginger wouldn't do that.

12:36.343 --> 12:38.971
How is Carrie?

12:39.013 --> 12:43.643
She's resting. The doctor came
to give her a sedative but she refused.

12:43.684 --> 12:45.584
She wanted to continue practicing.

12:45.619 --> 12:48.816
The pressure's getting to her.
The press and the TV people.

12:48.856 --> 12:52.952
- What makes you think Ginger's doing this?
- Well, you tell me.

12:52.993 --> 12:55.791
You were the one
kissing her on the court yesterday.

12:55.829 --> 12:57.922
Magnum...

12:57.965 --> 13:00.229
I told you. We're old friends.

13:00.267 --> 13:03.236
I know Ginger.
She wouldn't stoop to anything like that.

13:03.270 --> 13:08.469
Oh, no? She's getting old, she's jealous
of Carrie's talent, she wants to hang on.

13:08.509 --> 13:11.307
By terrorizing your daughter?
Come on, Mrs. Reardon!

13:11.345 --> 13:16.044
I admit Miss Grant's friendship with Magnum
is hardly a stellar character reference

13:16.083 --> 13:19.450
but in all fairness,
that is not proof Miss Grant is involved.

13:19.486 --> 13:23.252
- Who else could it be?
- Just about everyone else on the Pro tour.

13:24.825 --> 13:27.521
- What exactly does that mean?
- Just what I said.

13:27.561 --> 13:30.291
Talk to those she plays against, or with.

13:30.331 --> 13:34.893
I'm gonna tell you something.
You don't get to the top unless you want it.

13:34.935 --> 13:36.903
And want it bad enough.

13:36.937 --> 13:38.768
- Obviously, you want it.
- Yes.

13:40.040 --> 13:44.670
And Carrie's wanted it ever since
she could walk. Now this is the arrangement.

13:45.179 --> 13:47.909
I raise my daughter the way I see fit.

13:48.949 --> 13:52.885
You just make sure nothing happens to her
so she can play in this tournament.

13:52.920 --> 13:56.014
That is, if you can keep away
from Miss Grant long enough.

13:59.893 --> 14:04.990
Carrie's expecting you
at the practice session at one o'clock. Sharp.

14:19.480 --> 14:21.414
- Lovely out, isn't it?
- Yes.

14:21.448 --> 14:25.851
- I thought you were baby-sitting?
- I am. We're waiting for the rain to stop.

14:25.886 --> 14:29.049
The precious thing
is in the locker room with her mother.

14:29.089 --> 14:31.080
Plotting strategy, no doubt.

14:31.125 --> 14:33.525
- For the mixed doubles.
- No, for me.

14:33.560 --> 14:35.619
They want my crown and this year.

14:35.662 --> 14:38.654
There's an awful lot at stake for them.

14:38.699 --> 14:40.690
And for you.

14:42.770 --> 14:45.330
You really got my number.

14:45.372 --> 14:48.364
Er... Klondike 52424.

14:48.409 --> 14:53.346
- You really do still have my number!
- It was always hard to forget.

14:54.882 --> 14:57.442
Like you.

14:57.484 --> 15:01.181
I still have those letters
from all those faraway places

15:01.221 --> 15:04.622
like Gibraltar, the Philippines, Vietnam...

15:04.658 --> 15:08.788
Yeah, I got some postcards
from some pretty faraway places too.

15:10.864 --> 15:12.855
It was really hard on tour.

15:13.133 --> 15:17.001
I mean, I was always moving
and practicing, playing, traveling.

15:17.037 --> 15:21.565
- I kept track of you on the sports page.
- Oh, yes, the good old sports page.

15:21.608 --> 15:24.372
My entire life story. Winning, losing...

15:24.411 --> 15:26.641
Mostly winning.

15:28.916 --> 15:31.214
I can relate to Carrie. A lot.

15:32.152 --> 15:37.351
- Come on. You were never like her.
- Oh, yes, I was. Still am.

15:37.991 --> 15:40.721
I hate to lose
more than anything in the world.

15:40.761 --> 15:43.855
It gets so winning becomes... everything.

15:45.299 --> 15:47.790
- Mr. Magnum.
- I'll be right with you, David.

15:47.835 --> 15:49.826
Your partner's ready.

15:50.604 --> 15:53.937
- I said I'll be right with you.
- She is waiting, mate.

16:00.614 --> 16:03.708
No, no, no. That's wrong, wrong, wrong.

16:03.750 --> 16:07.208
- What's wrong, wrong, wrong?
- Your back 'and.

16:07.254 --> 16:09.449
- My what?
- Your back 'and.

16:09.490 --> 16:12.220
- You mean my backhand?
- Your backhand.

16:12.292 --> 16:14.283
Well, excuse me, Miss Zorro.

16:14.328 --> 16:16.592
- Zora.
- Zora.

16:17.464 --> 16:19.694
Excuse me. Let's get on with this.

16:19.733 --> 16:23.965
Right, Kenny, right. No sweat.
Go ahead, sweetheart. Serve.

16:24.004 --> 16:26.234
- What?
- Serve! Serve the ball!

16:26.273 --> 16:28.764
OK, OK, OK!

16:34.047 --> 16:36.038
- Ah!
- I'm sorry.

16:39.553 --> 16:41.885
Maybe we can have dinner sometime.

16:41.922 --> 16:43.913
Pick me up at eight.

16:47.027 --> 16:49.018
To the past.

16:55.002 --> 16:57.368
- How's Jim?
- My brother's still mad at me

16:57.404 --> 16:58.803
for letting you get away.

17:01.375 --> 17:03.741
Well, what does he know anyway?

17:03.777 --> 17:06.973
Stuck on an icebreaker
in the middle of the Arctic.

17:07.013 --> 17:09.005
Yeah. Not smart like us.

17:10.317 --> 17:12.911
Icebreaker?

17:12.953 --> 17:14.944
In the middle of the Arctic?

17:17.858 --> 17:20.884
I still have that picture of you
on graduation day.

17:20.928 --> 17:24.227
You know, the one of you
all puffed up and proud.

17:24.263 --> 17:26.255
That gorgeous white uniform.

17:27.733 --> 17:30.328
- What happened?
- I resigned.

17:31.772 --> 17:35.139
That must have been difficult.
A <i>ft</i> er you worked so hard to get it.

17:35.175 --> 17:36.199
Yeah.

17:36.243 --> 17:40.236
Well, you... always knew what you wanted.

17:41.381 --> 17:43.212
So did you.

17:43.250 --> 17:46.549
We really were so much alike, weren't we?

17:48.755 --> 17:50.655
What happened?

17:50.691 --> 17:52.625
I had my career, you had yours.

17:53.360 --> 17:55.351
Kind of overwhelmed me.

17:57.030 --> 17:59.021
Yeah, that's the way the Navy was.

17:59.066 --> 18:03.196
- Maybe if had written more, tried to...
- I was moving around a lot.

18:03.236 --> 18:07.172
It seems like I've been around the world
a hundred times or more.

18:07.207 --> 18:10.574
I just wish that I had run into you
a little sooner.

18:11.478 --> 18:13.469
Maybe later's better.

18:25.759 --> 18:27.818
Quick feet now. Quick feet now.

18:30.030 --> 18:34.057
Good. Good cross court.
Good cross court. Good cross court.

18:36.136 --> 18:38.400
Step into your backhand! Step into it!

18:38.438 --> 18:43.034
You just can't stand there.
Step into the backhand!

18:44.211 --> 18:46.338
Good grief!

19:08.301 --> 19:11.566
Let's decide who's playing net
and who's playing baseline.

19:11.605 --> 19:15.132
Sorry. I'm used to having
the whole court to myself.

19:21.181 --> 19:25.311
You think you could include me for once?
Give me a chance.

19:37.497 --> 19:39.397
Not Higgins! That's it.

19:46.840 --> 19:49.570
Hey!

19:49.609 --> 19:51.270
Hey!

19:52.612 --> 19:56.173
- What do you think you're doing?
- What does it look like I am doing?

19:56.216 --> 19:58.776
It looks like you are spying on my team.

19:58.852 --> 20:01.150
How sadly paranoid, T.C.

20:01.188 --> 20:04.919
I am observing certain tendencies
in Magnum and Miss Reardon's play

20:04.958 --> 20:07.859
which will facilitate my training
Rick and Miss Korcek.

20:07.894 --> 20:12.661
- But that's spying.
- Don't be absurd. That's not necessary.

20:12.699 --> 20:16.260
Rick's superior quickness
and Miss Korcek's power will prevail.

20:18.672 --> 20:24.042
If you're so sure about that, would you care
to put your money where your mouth is?

20:24.077 --> 20:28.036
You're suggesting that we bet
on the outcome of the mixed doubles?

20:28.081 --> 20:33.178
Tut-tut-tut-tut. A gentleman's wager,
just between us two coaches, Higgie baby.

20:33.220 --> 20:37.623
Use of your aerial services
for two months for photographic essays.

20:37.657 --> 20:41.388
The tennis court, the hot tub,
Masters' VTR for the same amount of time.

20:41.428 --> 20:43.419
Done.

20:47.534 --> 20:49.764
Where are they? Where'd they go?

20:51.705 --> 20:54.003
- Where are you taking me?
- To the estate!

20:54.040 --> 20:55.837
We weren't finished practicing!

20:55.876 --> 20:59.334
That was not practicing,
that was hand-to-hand combat with Kenny!

20:59.379 --> 21:01.506
Kenny's such a baby, I couldn't resist.

21:01.548 --> 21:03.539
Anyway, I'm mad at you.

21:03.650 --> 21:07.484
- We're supposed to be on the same side!
- That's my point!

21:07.521 --> 21:12.857
Well, how come you're spending all
your time with Ginger Grant instead of me?

21:12.893 --> 21:15.327
I am not spending all my time
with Ginger Grant.

21:15.362 --> 21:18.991
And I am watching you, like a hawk. Come on!

21:24.337 --> 21:26.362
- You all right?
- Yeah.

21:26.406 --> 21:28.340
Rick, watch her!

21:28.375 --> 21:31.003
- I know, and run down the plate.
- Yeah.

21:32.078 --> 21:34.103
- Hey, are you all right?
- Yeah.

23:05.839 --> 23:07.830
Thomas.

23:21.486 --> 23:23.924
- I told you, it isn't my car.
- Ginger...

23:23.949 --> 23:25.356
I hope you're not too disappointed.

23:25.381 --> 23:27.916
- I had to ask.
- Oh, no, you didn't.

23:27.959 --> 23:32.328
I followed that car here. It almost killed her.
Whoever was driving it meant business.

23:32.363 --> 23:34.228
- Obviously, so do you.
- Ginger...

23:34.265 --> 23:36.665
Why don't you come out and say it?
Just say it!

23:36.701 --> 23:39.295
Ageing tennis star headed
for the senior circuit.

23:39.337 --> 23:43.296
Before she goes, she's gonna terrorize
the teenage heiress to the throne...

23:43.341 --> 23:46.435
Wait a minute, will you?
Ginger, I don't believe that.

23:46.477 --> 23:49.344
- Then I'm really confused.
- Well, so am I.

23:49.380 --> 23:54.443
Oh, a strong vote of confidence. That's
what I'm getting from everyone around here.

23:54.485 --> 23:59.445
You know, this tournament is supposed
to be my swan song, the end of an era.

23:59.490 --> 24:02.755
- Ginger, that's got to...
- End sooner or later?

24:03.694 --> 24:05.685
Why? Who says?

24:06.964 --> 24:09.865
Too old? Too slow?

24:09.901 --> 24:11.926
Not yet.

24:11.969 --> 24:15.871
Thomas, I told you, I hate to lose
more than anything in the world.

24:15.907 --> 24:18.705
But not enough to dust off Carrie Reardon.

24:20.344 --> 24:22.778
Better luck elsewhere, huh?

24:47.805 --> 24:49.966
<i>The car was someone else's</i>.

24:50.007 --> 24:55.138
<i>My little voice and the look on Ginger's face
told me I should have known that.</i>

24:55.179 --> 25:00.947
<i>But I guess when you spend a lot of time
with people who don't trust each other,</i>

25:00.985 --> 25:02.976
<i>it kind of rubs off</i>.

25:03.020 --> 25:05.011
Magnum!

25:12.863 --> 25:14.763
- What is it?
- What is it?

25:14.799 --> 25:19.395
Carrie Reardon is almost killed under your
protection and you have the gall to ask that?

25:19.437 --> 25:21.735
Spare me the lectures. I have work to do.

25:21.772 --> 25:23.763
I demand an explanation.

25:23.808 --> 25:27.869
OK. No, no, yes, no.

25:27.912 --> 25:29.903
I beg your pardon?

25:29.947 --> 25:34.941
No, I did not catch this yo-yo, no, I have
no idea where he or she might have gone,

25:34.986 --> 25:40.515
yes, I realize my responsibility to God,
country, Robin and that little... tennis player.

25:40.558 --> 25:44.961
No, I was not remiss in my duties
this a <i>ft</i> ernoon. By the way, how is she?

25:46.130 --> 25:48.121
Unbearable.

25:48.165 --> 25:50.156
Magnum...

25:51.602 --> 25:54.901
- Higgins, could you?
- No, I most certainly will not.

25:54.939 --> 25:57.339
Mr. Magnum!

25:57.375 --> 26:00.242
- Higgins, please...
- All right.

26:04.682 --> 26:06.946
Higgins, where the hell is Magnum?

26:06.984 --> 26:10.044
On the phone with one of
his sordid underworld connections.

26:10.087 --> 26:13.579
- Did he find the person driving?
- That's what he's working on.

26:13.624 --> 26:16.388
I knew it would escalate
into something like this.

26:16.427 --> 26:20.124
Magnum is doing everything he can
under very trying circumstances.

26:20.164 --> 26:23.656
This is quite minor compared
to what happened to me once

26:23.701 --> 26:28.070
when MI6 assigned me to assist
Scotland Yard on a particularly bizarre case.

26:28.105 --> 26:31.302
It was in '53... or was it '54? No matter.

26:31.342 --> 26:34.004
It involved a ladies' rugby team
in the Midlands

26:34.045 --> 26:37.981
being terrorized by a demented chap
with a passion for soiled sweat-socks.

26:38.015 --> 26:42.179
As you can imagine, I was quite bemused
by the details of the case...

26:42.219 --> 26:46.148
What do you mean, Rick's on the courts?
Keoki, I need that license.

26:46.317 --> 26:47.316
Tell him...

26:48.349 --> 26:50.340
OK, OK, I'll wait.

26:51.436 --> 26:54.803
Oh, of course I trust Ice Pick. I trust him.

26:54.941 --> 26:56.932
I'll be by the phone. Thanks.

26:59.437 --> 27:04.238
<i>I learned a long time ago about days
when everything goes wrong.</i>

27:04.319 --> 27:08.346
<i>No matter what you do, when that happens,
there's no sense in fighting it.</i>

27:08.554 --> 27:12.718
<i>In fact, the only thing to do is
just kick back, close your eyes</i>

27:12.743 --> 27:16.509
<i>and let the peace and quiet
wash the rest of the day away.</i>

27:57.564 --> 27:58.718
Excuse me.

28:00.798 --> 28:04.063
- Don't do that!
- Don't you ever knock?

28:04.101 --> 28:06.433
- In my own house?
- Oh.

28:08.472 --> 28:11.236
You're probably wondering
what I'm doing here.

28:11.275 --> 28:15.712
Probably. Inasmuch as you were almost run
down by a car two hours ago.

28:17.615 --> 28:21.449
I just needed a place
to get away from everything.

28:21.485 --> 28:23.680
Everyone.

28:23.721 --> 28:26.952
Reporters. Police. My mother.

28:39.270 --> 28:41.261
You don't like me much, do you?

28:42.306 --> 28:44.331
You don't let yourself be very likable.

28:44.375 --> 28:46.969
Which makes it hard for me to do my job.

28:50.114 --> 28:53.641
How many players have you humiliated
so far in this tournament?

28:54.685 --> 28:57.210
- You mean eliminated?
- No, humiliated.

28:57.254 --> 29:00.018
Like the way you practice with Kenny. Why?

29:00.057 --> 29:02.389
That's none of your business.

29:02.426 --> 29:06.920
Look, all I'm saying, Carrie,
is tennis is not a game to you anymore.

29:08.032 --> 29:11.524
You're right about that. Look...

29:11.569 --> 29:15.733
I'm an 18-year-old kid,
and I'm a corporation.

29:16.941 --> 29:19.307
I've got a board of directors, three lawyers,

29:19.343 --> 29:22.312
two accountants, two agents,
a business manager.

29:22.346 --> 29:25.440
They're all a bunch of jerks
who wear suits and ties

29:25.483 --> 29:29.283
and talk in some language
that no one else can even understand.

29:29.320 --> 29:31.720
And now I've got some weirdo a <i>ft</i> er me

29:31.755 --> 29:33.882
who's trying to kill me or something.

29:34.525 --> 29:36.516
And I don't even know why.

29:37.127 --> 29:39.459
What have I done that's so terrible?

29:39.497 --> 29:41.488
Except want to play tennis.

29:42.466 --> 29:45.833
That's all I've ever wanted to do, is play tennis.

29:45.870 --> 29:47.838
And now I hate it.

29:47.872 --> 29:49.863
I mean, I hate it.

29:52.510 --> 29:54.501
Why don't you quit?

29:56.547 --> 29:59.107
- Just walk out on everything?
- Yeah.

29:59.583 --> 30:01.574
It's not that easy, Magnum.

30:01.619 --> 30:05.020
I've got obligations, responsibilities.

30:07.091 --> 30:11.391
Besides... my mom would kill me.

30:11.428 --> 30:14.226
Carrie, it's your life.

30:15.900 --> 30:17.891
No...

30:17.935 --> 30:21.598
Nothing... is mine anymore.

30:26.610 --> 30:28.510
Carrie...

30:29.880 --> 30:31.871
Magnum...

30:32.983 --> 30:35.042
- Magnum!
- Higgins...

30:35.085 --> 30:37.952
My God, man, have you
completely lost your mind?

30:37.988 --> 30:42.186
Don't start with me.
It's not what you think. It's not even close.

30:43.027 --> 30:45.018
Tell him.

30:47.565 --> 30:51.865
- What are you barging in here for anyway?
- It was quite by accident.

30:51.902 --> 30:56.566
Now thank me for sparing you from
compromising what's le <i>ft</i> of your reputation.

30:56.607 --> 30:58.598
Higgins!

30:59.944 --> 31:03.903
Rick called. He said to meet him at the club,
on the court. It's important.

31:04.748 --> 31:08.707
- Why didn't he call here?
- He said the phone was off the hook.

31:15.526 --> 31:17.517
Bedroom?

31:22.299 --> 31:24.290
The bedroom.

31:30.341 --> 31:33.606
<i>An hour talking to Rick
did a lot to thicken the plot.</i>

31:33.644 --> 31:36.909
<i>It turns out the car was a rental.
But then they always are.</i>

31:36.947 --> 31:41.441
<i>However, they're not usually rented
to the coach of the intended victim.</i>

32:01.672 --> 32:05.199
<i>The idea of Dave Duncan trying
to kill Carrie made as much sense</i>

32:05.242 --> 32:08.643
<i>as someone trying to strangle
the goose that laid the golden egg.</i>

32:08.679 --> 32:14.311
<i>But then a teenage kid making millions
for hitting a ball didn't make sense either.</i>

32:16.120 --> 32:19.521
<i>Come to think of it,
nothing about this made much sense.</i>

32:19.556 --> 32:23.151
<i>Of course, every game's got
a different set of rules.</i>

32:23.394 --> 32:26.192
<i>And each bungalow a different number</i>.

32:26.230 --> 32:29.495
<i>One day, I'm gonna want
to tell Ginger I'm sorry.</i>

32:37.010 --> 32:38.469
- Oh, hi, Mrs. Reardon.
- Hello.

32:38.494 --> 32:40.308
Hiya, Dave.

32:40.344 --> 32:43.802
Listen, are you two busy?
Because I've got some news for you.

32:43.847 --> 32:48.011
You know that Volvo that almost ran down
poor little Carrie? It's parked outside.

32:48.052 --> 32:50.782
And guess who it's registered to? Guess.

32:54.758 --> 32:56.817
You don't have to guess, do you?

32:57.494 --> 32:59.655
What you have done has got to be...

32:59.697 --> 33:01.722
Save us the lecture, Mr. Magnum.

33:02.499 --> 33:04.626
All we're doing is promoting a product.

33:04.668 --> 33:08.229
You call trying to kill your daughter
promoting a product?

33:09.673 --> 33:13.632
It's publicity. Every little bit helps her.

33:15.279 --> 33:17.270
She's an 18-year-old kid.

33:17.314 --> 33:21.250
You ever taken the time to talk to her,
to find out how she feels?

33:21.285 --> 33:24.049
Or are you too busy
working on your own careers?

33:24.088 --> 33:26.454
You're exploiting the hell out of her.

33:26.490 --> 33:30.290
Since I was hired to find out
who's doing this, she's gonna know about it.

33:30.327 --> 33:32.522
I already know about it.

33:35.432 --> 33:38.731
The whole thing was my idea in the first place.

33:45.174 --> 33:50.202
<i>Welcome to the next event in the
Robin Masters Pro-Am tennis tournament.</i>

33:50.246 --> 33:53.977
<i>Getting underway shortly
will be the Pro-Am mixed doubles</i>

33:54.016 --> 33:56.541
<i>featuring Zora Korcek and Orville Wright</i>

33:56.585 --> 33:59.053
<i>against Carrie Reardon
and Thomas Magnum.</i>

33:59.088 --> 34:04.082
There is no absolutely no way I'm going
to step out on that court with that little...

34:04.126 --> 34:08.529
I am your coach. I am your mentor.
I will kill you if you don't play.

34:08.563 --> 34:10.929
Fine. Then you can play.

34:10.966 --> 34:13.092
I can't. Higgie and I have a...

34:14.536 --> 34:16.937
Sorry, guys, all bets are off.

34:16.972 --> 34:20.931
They are not. You made a commitment
to this tournament, and to Robin Masters.

34:20.976 --> 34:23.911
But Carrie explained away
that little problem!

34:23.946 --> 34:26.915
In a tournament of this size,
there are always problems.

34:26.949 --> 34:30.112
What's the crisis today?
Somebody wear unmatched socks?

34:30.152 --> 34:34.145
Kenny Phelps was disqualified
for obscene and obnoxious behavior.

34:34.190 --> 34:36.021
What's new about that?

34:36.058 --> 34:41.018
This followed from a very public and nasty
altercation between Phelps and Reardon.

34:41.063 --> 34:45.397
- A most unsavory display.
- She probably deserved every word of it.

34:45.434 --> 34:47.561
This morning we received this letter.

34:48.737 --> 34:51.001
It's a threat on Carrie Reardon's life.

34:52.741 --> 34:55.335
How do you know? There's no name on it.

34:55.377 --> 34:58.505
For God's sake,
who else could it be referring to?

34:58.547 --> 35:00.071
He's right, man.

35:00.749 --> 35:04.185
Knowing Carrie, that's a good point, Higgins.
That's one for you.

35:04.220 --> 35:08.020
Be that as it may, this thing is
not worth the paper it's glued on.

35:08.057 --> 35:10.287
It's obviously another publicity stunt.

35:10.326 --> 35:13.921
- We simply can't afford to take chances.
- Count me out!

35:13.963 --> 35:17.228
- I've done my tour of duty.
- If something were to happen...

35:17.266 --> 35:19.291
- It won't!
- .. I'd feel quite certain

35:19.335 --> 35:24.329
that Robin Masters would hold you
personally and totally responsible.

35:24.373 --> 35:28.434
And of course I have a witness
to this entire conversation.

35:36.886 --> 35:41.152
- Thank you, Magnum.
- Don't forget to step into your backhand!

35:52.968 --> 35:55.903
- No hard feelings?
- No, of course not.

35:55.938 --> 35:59.738
I just got a lot of explaining
to do to somebody. Let's get it over with.

35:59.775 --> 36:02.539
Look, Thomas, it was a joke.

36:02.578 --> 36:04.773
Yeah, your joke and a sick one.

36:04.813 --> 36:06.804
The car, the paint, the doll.

36:06.849 --> 36:09.579
You gotta do what you gotta do.

36:10.319 --> 36:12.913
Besides, the doll thing wasn't even my idea.

36:12.955 --> 36:16.413
It was so corny. It had to have been Dave's.

36:16.458 --> 36:18.858
Then the letter was Dave's too, huh?

36:21.830 --> 36:23.957
- Hi, Ron.
- I guess I'm a little late,

36:23.999 --> 36:27.196
- but I wanted to wish you both luck.
- Thank you.

36:27.236 --> 36:30.228
I also wanted to offer you congratulations.

36:30.272 --> 36:35.710
Well, Mrs. Reardon explained to me that
nobody will be bothering Carrie anymore.

36:35.811 --> 36:40.839
I don't know how you did it, Magnum,
but I just want to thank you personally.

36:41.817 --> 36:45.412
Who did it? I mean, who was doing it to her?

36:46.322 --> 36:49.553
I'm sorry,
I'm afraid you'll have to ask them that.

36:49.592 --> 36:51.958
I never believed anyone was gonna kill her.

36:51.994 --> 36:55.191
I mean, her opponents, jilted boyfriend...

36:55.998 --> 36:57.989
No.

36:58.601 --> 37:02.594
Her real enemy was...
out to destroy her psychologically.

37:03.472 --> 37:05.872
Humiliate her, you know what I mean?

37:07.876 --> 37:09.867
It's funny.

37:10.613 --> 37:15.414
Cos that only succeeded in driving her away
from those who cared for her.

37:16.352 --> 37:18.286
I mean, really cared.

37:19.154 --> 37:22.317
<i>And it looks like
we're ready to begin the match.</i>

37:22.358 --> 37:25.885
<i>Serving first will be
the team of Korcek and Wright.</i>

37:49.785 --> 37:52.845
- Yah-ha-ha!
- <i>Love-15</i>.

38:13.642 --> 38:14.631
Aha!

38:14.677 --> 38:17.339
- <i>30-15</i>.
- Nice shot.

38:37.333 --> 38:39.324
I did this for you, Babushka.

38:39.535 --> 38:41.969
<i>40-15</i>.

38:49.345 --> 38:51.142
<i>Deuce</i>.

38:51.180 --> 38:54.240
Come on, will you?
Now I'm doing it all by myself.

38:54.283 --> 38:57.013
Well, don't let me get in the way. Do more.

38:58.020 --> 39:02.719
<i>Despite the fact that I had a spoilt,
manipulating jerk as a teammate,</i>

39:02.758 --> 39:05.556
<i>I found myself beginning to have fun</i>.

39:05.594 --> 39:10.861
<i>Competition causes you to lose your
inhibitions and brings out the best in you.</i>

39:12.101 --> 39:14.365
Aaargh!

39:14.403 --> 39:16.564
<i>30-40</i>.

39:36.091 --> 39:38.992
<i>Game and second set
to Magnum and Reardon.</i>

39:39.027 --> 39:41.495
<i>Sets are even at one apiece</i>.

39:42.297 --> 39:44.629
Ha-ha!

39:44.666 --> 39:47.260
All right. Now we got them
on the ropes, baby.

39:47.302 --> 39:49.566
Now, remember what I taught you...

39:49.605 --> 39:51.835
I know, I've heard it 3,000 times.

39:52.141 --> 39:55.269
The racquet is an extension of my arm...

39:55.310 --> 39:58.177
Which is an extension of my body,
which is...

39:58.213 --> 40:00.204
A player who don't play.

40:00.949 --> 40:04.817
You know something, T.C.,
this doesn't even make any sense.

40:04.853 --> 40:07.481
I'm just gonna keep my eye on the ball, OK?

40:07.523 --> 40:10.151
Well, try and get your racquet on it too.

40:10.759 --> 40:12.989
Where's Carrie? Where's Carrie?

40:13.028 --> 40:15.053
She's inside changing, mate.

40:15.097 --> 40:19.033
Does it at least a dozen times every match.
Good for the endorsements, eh?

40:21.837 --> 40:27.207
Magnum, what's done is done, right?
What's the point of holding a grudge?

40:27.242 --> 40:31.975
Oh, I don't hold a grudge. I just plain
don't like you or the way you do business.

40:32.014 --> 40:34.608
I know it's real funny, your hanging doll bit.

40:34.650 --> 40:36.777
So that's what's eating you.

40:37.686 --> 40:40.985
Come on, mate, put it to bed.
That was Carrie's little trick.

40:43.392 --> 40:45.383
What about this?

40:50.432 --> 40:53.458
Hey, now, wait a minute.
I don't know anything about this.

41:14.857 --> 41:18.054
<i>Hearing Carrie and Duncan explain
the doll and the letter</i>

41:18.093 --> 41:20.755
<i>was like adding two and two
and coming up with 13.</i>

41:20.796 --> 41:25.199
<i>Something was definitely wrong
and my little voice was shouting</i>

41:25.234 --> 41:27.361
<i>that something was Kenny Phelps</i>.

41:46.021 --> 41:47.852
Stop right there!

41:50.158 --> 41:51.955
Ronald, let her go.

41:52.728 --> 41:57.062
No. I can't. Can't do it.

41:59.001 --> 42:02.368
She tried to hurt Carrie. To destroy her.

42:04.139 --> 42:06.039
She...

42:06.074 --> 42:10.511
She changed her. She turned her
against everyone who loved her.

42:11.413 --> 42:13.540
Against me.

42:13.582 --> 42:15.709
We were friends.

42:16.785 --> 42:20.050
Ronald, Carrie never cared
for anyone but herself.

42:20.889 --> 42:26.759
That's not true. No. I've got letters, postcards.
We had dinner together.

42:27.663 --> 42:30.097
She cared. She cared very much.

42:30.132 --> 42:32.327
For tennis, maybe.

42:32.367 --> 42:34.835
And for money and stardom. Ronald...

42:35.571 --> 42:37.664
She used people to get what she wanted.

42:37.706 --> 42:40.641
You're wrong. I know Carrie.

42:41.543 --> 42:43.841
No, you don't, Ron.

42:46.615 --> 42:50.711
Everything he said about me. It's true.

42:52.621 --> 42:55.249
You should be holding that knife to me.

42:56.758 --> 43:00.558
No. You're good. You're innocent.

43:00.596 --> 43:03.030
No!

43:03.065 --> 43:08.731
Everything that happened,
all those tricks and everything, it was me.

43:10.238 --> 43:12.229
Ginger didn't do anything.

43:15.243 --> 43:18.144
- Ronald, give me the knife.
- No.

43:18.981 --> 43:21.916
- Give it to me.
- No.

44:00.989 --> 44:03.981
Higgie baby, I cannot believe
you won't meet me halfway.

44:04.026 --> 44:06.824
At least gas money.
I thought you were a gentleman.

44:06.862 --> 44:08.921
You were and are quite correct.

44:08.964 --> 44:14.061
And we had a gentleman's wager,
the terms of which were crystal clear.

44:14.102 --> 44:16.570
- I won and you lost.
- But...

44:16.605 --> 44:18.869
This is unsportsmanlike conduct.

44:18.907 --> 44:21.398
- Unsportsmanlike conduct?
- That's right.

44:21.443 --> 44:25.607
Need I remind you that you suggested
this wager in the first place?

44:25.647 --> 44:27.808
If my players won, which they did,

44:27.849 --> 44:31.376
I was to have unlimited use
of your aerial service for two months.

44:31.420 --> 44:34.821
Was I wrong to assume
you would honor your gambling debts?

44:34.856 --> 44:38.587
- Higgie baby, the match was not over.
- Of course it was over.

44:38.627 --> 44:43.792
Magnum did not return to the court for
the third and climactic set. He forfeited.

44:43.832 --> 44:47.563
- He was saving Ginger's life.
- That's irrelevant. To the match, I mean.

44:47.602 --> 44:51.038
Higgie baby, the match ain't over until it's over.

45:09.191 --> 45:11.751
Jonathan! Oh, Jonathan!

45:11.793 --> 45:15.627
I believe you know the ladies of
the Sandwich Island Botanical Society?

45:15.664 --> 45:17.996
Oh, Jonathan, I hope we're not late.

45:18.033 --> 45:22.129
Marion was fixing watercress sandwiches
and forgot to trim the crusts.

45:22.170 --> 45:25.571
Of course we had
to completely repack the picnic basket.

45:25.607 --> 45:28.633
- Agatha...
- Then we had to go to the chemist.

45:28.677 --> 45:32.113
Evelyn gets a teensy bit airsick.

45:32.147 --> 45:34.411
Uh, Higgins...

45:34.449 --> 45:39.785
You do promise not to go too fast,
don't you, Mr. Calvin? Or too high?

45:40.889 --> 45:45.417
- I'll just skim right along the tree tops.
- Oh, delightful.

45:46.695 --> 45:49.664
Now, Evelyn, you promised to take that pill.

45:49.698 --> 45:52.895
Now, do be a dear and do what I tell you.

45:55.137 --> 45:57.765
Somewhere, somehow,
I'm going to get you for this.

45:57.806 --> 46:00.070
Higgie baby, I can't wait until this is over.

46:01.143 --> 46:04.476
T.C., baby, it ain't over until it's over.

46:16.792 --> 46:20.626
At the risk of sounding repetitive - my hero.

46:21.229 --> 46:23.220
He was only five foot three.

46:24.599 --> 46:26.590
Thanks for your help, anyway.

46:31.273 --> 46:35.710
I've been spending so much time
convincing myself I could do anything.

46:35.744 --> 46:37.939
I know.

46:37.979 --> 46:43.110
That's why I like tennis, though. When
I'm out on that court, all I've got there is me.

46:43.151 --> 46:46.814
There's no one to depend on,
no one to blame, just me.

46:47.589 --> 46:49.420
I know.

46:49.457 --> 46:51.857
It's very addictive.

46:53.995 --> 46:56.862
- I'm not sure I could give it up.
- I'd never ask you to.

46:58.466 --> 47:01.367
But Carrie's gonna fight you. Hard.

47:02.204 --> 47:05.640
She's not gonna win. Not this time.

47:05.674 --> 47:08.370
Maybe next year, maybe the year a <i>ft</i> er.

47:08.410 --> 47:12.437
I also know that I would make
a terrible undefeated champ.

47:13.348 --> 47:15.782
But it's just this crazy thing.

47:15.817 --> 47:20.379
I feel I have to get this losing thing out
of the way before I can start something new.

47:20.422 --> 47:22.982
I know.

47:23.024 --> 47:27.154
- I'm on the court at ten. Will you be there?
- Wouldn't miss it.

47:27.195 --> 47:29.322
Great. I'll see you.

47:35.770 --> 47:37.761
Bye, Ginger.
