¶ I can be your native hero ¶

01:07.835 --> 01:12.171
¶ You can be my damsel in need ¶

01:12.173 --> 01:17.109
¶ We can play out this game
you'll see ¶

01:17.111 --> 01:22.181
¶ We can be rock's king and
queen ¶

01:22.450 --> 01:27.519
¶ I'll croon and you'll idolize
me ¶

01:27.721 --> 01:30.089
¶ Little Frankie needs you ¶

01:30.091 --> 01:32.491
¶ I'm a good boy ¶

01:32.493 --> 01:37.663
¶ I can be a rebel in
your hands ¶

01:37.665 --> 01:39.164
¶ I can be your tattoo ¶

01:39.166 --> 01:40.399
- Who are you?

01:41.435 --> 01:43.335
Lost?

01:43.336 --> 01:45.236
- Mr. Earl Bob Hendersen,
I'm Gloria Nation.

01:45.239 --> 01:47.139
Sir, the investigator.

01:47.141 --> 01:48.507
You skipped bail.

01:48.509 --> 01:49.875
I'm here to take you in.

01:49.877 --> 01:50.876
Come on, let's go.

01:52.113 --> 01:53.445
¶ I'm a good boy ¶

01:53.447 --> 01:56.348
¶ Rebel in your hands ¶

01:56.350 --> 01:58.684
- What's, what's FRA?

01:58.686 --> 02:00.886
- Fugitive recovery agent, sir.

02:03.257 --> 02:05.791
- You boys get me a little
present.

02:05.793 --> 02:07.860
One of those strippers?

02:10.364 --> 02:11.263
- Stripper?

02:12.266 --> 02:17.336
(upbeat music)
(people clamoring)

02:21.775 --> 02:24.209
- You're a feisty little bitch,
aren't ya?

02:25.779 --> 02:27.679
¶ I'm a good boy ¶

02:27.681 --> 02:29.348
¶ I can be a rebel ¶

02:29.350 --> 02:31.350
- Back the fuck up!

02:31.352 --> 02:32.251
Back up.

02:34.889 --> 02:36.622
All right, let's go.

02:37.558 --> 02:40.292
(country music)

02:44.565 --> 02:47.399
(pleasant music)

02:50.604 --> 02:52.838
I am Gloria Nation.

02:53.741 --> 02:56.842
I'm a Marine, I'm a single mom.

02:56.844 --> 02:59.912
Thomas, it's important
that you take great pride

02:59.914 --> 03:01.914
every day that you leave this
house.

03:01.916 --> 03:03.615
Now is that school appropriate?

03:03.617 --> 03:06.185
And I work two jobs.

03:06.187 --> 03:09.421
My bail bonds office sits in
the back of my tattoo parlor.

03:09.423 --> 03:11.490
We call it Nation's Fire.

03:13.327 --> 03:15.961
So I started my club Heaven's
Fire.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.413
- Hey girl.

03:17.414 --> 03:18.864
- [Gloria] I wanted to
follow my daddy's footsteps.

03:21.502 --> 03:25.537
My daddy was CW Nation,
Thomas and I call him Pop-Pop.

03:25.539 --> 03:28.740
My daddy started up the Reino
de la Furia, a biker club.

03:28.742 --> 03:31.443
It's a one percenter biker
club here in Florida.

03:31.445 --> 03:36.281
- Never take anything less
than your green for you.

03:36.283 --> 03:38.217
- [Gloria] Daddy was my
strength.

03:38.219 --> 03:39.818
- And then it's kinda
simple, all you have to do

03:39.820 --> 03:43.255
is go out there in the
real world, and get it.

03:43.257 --> 03:45.124
- And since he was the president

03:45.125 --> 03:46.992
of Reino de la Furia, I
knew them one percenters

03:46.994 --> 03:48.427
would not mind.

03:48.429 --> 03:49.895
Hell, they didn't even mind that
we had

03:49.897 --> 03:51.597
the Florida Rockers on our
backs.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.665
They knew we were ride or die
chicks.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.267
Yeah, it's been a good minute.

03:55.269 --> 03:56.902
- How's the little man?

03:56.904 --> 03:58.003
- He's doing great.

03:58.005 --> 04:00.289
Getting bigger every day.

04:00.290 --> 04:02.574
Rita, my former best friend,
took over my slot as president.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.877
We've been estranged ever
since Vito made me leave

04:05.879 --> 04:07.946
to raise my son and to help my
daddy.

04:09.683 --> 04:12.784
I'd love to stay and chat,
but I'm waiting for a meeting.

04:13.554 --> 04:14.920
Good to see you smiling again.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.957
My mama, growing up she was
dealing

04:18.959 --> 04:20.425
with a whole lot of alcohol
abuse.

04:20.427 --> 04:21.692
- I don't know how to say it,

04:21.695 --> 04:23.695
I'm not gonna say it again, I'm
done here!

04:23.697 --> 04:25.664
- No, no, you're not done!

04:25.666 --> 04:26.832
You said that before!

04:26.833 --> 04:27.999
I stopped drinking for three
days!

04:28.002 --> 04:31.270
- Don't do this in front
of this little girl!

04:31.272 --> 04:33.438
God almighty, what's the matter
with you?

04:35.576 --> 04:36.975
You're so calm.

04:36.977 --> 04:40.545
I can't believe it, I love you
so much.

04:40.547 --> 04:43.282
- I love you too darling,
Gloria!

04:43.284 --> 04:44.750
- Go find someplace
where you can't hear it,

04:44.752 --> 04:48.654
and if you really, really get
unhappy

04:48.656 --> 04:50.389
find me, call me.

04:51.392 --> 04:53.592
- We can talk this out!
- Okay darling.

04:53.594 --> 04:55.394
- I'll try and get it--
- I'm sorry about this.

04:55.396 --> 04:57.329
- Don't listen to him, Gloria.

04:57.331 --> 04:58.430
Don't listen to him!

04:58.432 --> 05:00.966
I don't care--
- I chose you, bitch,

05:00.968 --> 05:02.801
and now I'm done with you.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.036
- Oh you're gonna throw us all
away?

05:04.038 --> 05:05.487
- [CW] Oh shut up.

05:05.488 --> 05:06.937
- You don't throw a glass
away when it's broken.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.974
You don't throw a marriage away!

05:08.976 --> 05:11.576
You don't throw a relationship
away!

05:12.413 --> 05:13.779
- [Gloria] I was sent to a
boarding school

05:13.781 --> 05:15.347
up in Tallahassee.

05:17.584 --> 05:19.484
It was there that my childhood
dream

05:19.486 --> 05:21.486
of being a Marine became a
reality.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.855
- Really, a Marine?

05:23.857 --> 05:25.023
- Yep.
- Semper fi.

05:25.025 --> 05:26.758
Get over here for a hug.

05:28.495 --> 05:29.895
Outstanding.

05:30.764 --> 05:33.098
- [Gloria] After I got
back from the Marines.

05:34.735 --> 05:35.634
- He does

05:36.737 --> 05:37.969
love to rhyme.

05:39.606 --> 05:41.773
Just like his Pop-Pop.

05:41.775 --> 05:44.843
- [Gloria] We had a whole
'nother battle to face.

05:44.845 --> 05:45.894
- [CW] That's true.

05:45.895 --> 05:46.944
- [Gloria] My daddy had cancer.

05:46.947 --> 05:50.115
- His daddy is an asshole.

05:52.353 --> 05:53.585
- This is Thomas.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.655
My world, my heart.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.825
- Why did he have to leave?

05:59.827 --> 06:01.760
- No he didn't leave us.

06:01.762 --> 06:03.128
He's always here.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.697
Pop-Pop was just needed.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.699
It was Daddy who helped raise
Thomas

06:07.701 --> 06:09.668
after I was deployed overseas.

06:10.437 --> 06:13.872
He loved you so much.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.891
Thomas, let's go

06:15.892 --> 06:17.909
Trying to make sure he ain't
nothing like his daddy.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.144
Not if I could help it.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.149
Thomas!

06:24.151 --> 06:27.085
He was all his Pop-Pop.

06:27.087 --> 06:29.588
(rock music)

06:35.028 --> 06:37.396
You have patience like a saint.

06:37.398 --> 06:39.598
- Hey Saturday, can you come
early?

06:39.600 --> 06:41.066
I can go on before Nasty Savage.

06:42.169 --> 06:44.002
- [Man] Hey Freddy, fire up
that--

06:44.004 --> 06:46.838
- There she goes, folks!

06:46.840 --> 06:47.973
Running away!

06:48.742 --> 06:49.641
As usual.

06:53.046 --> 06:55.147
No wonder you went to Iraq.

06:56.850 --> 06:57.749
Iran.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.019
Well.

07:01.021 --> 07:01.920
The country

07:03.857 --> 07:08.460
that suits your little diva
needs, Iran!

07:09.196 --> 07:10.429
You ran.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.432
Pew, pew, pew!

07:15.769 --> 07:18.036
Hell, we all ran.

07:18.038 --> 07:18.937
Right?

07:18.939 --> 07:23.775
Owen, can you go get me some
more beer in the back fridge?

07:23.777 --> 07:25.110
We're all out in here.

07:25.112 --> 07:30.482
- [Gloria] Must your grandson
always see this side of you?

07:33.020 --> 07:34.553
- Well let me get this straight,

07:34.555 --> 07:38.723
it's okay for Tommy to
see his daddy in prison.

07:40.928 --> 07:41.960
Oops.

07:43.831 --> 07:45.730
But that isn't it.

07:45.732 --> 07:47.115
A wee bit late.

07:47.116 --> 07:48.499
- I asked you to take him to
school

07:48.502 --> 07:50.602
when I had something planned.

07:50.604 --> 07:54.506
And in classic Myra Johnson
form, something came up.

07:54.508 --> 07:58.176
I wish for a moment you'd act

07:58.178 --> 08:00.712
like somebody's mama, or grandma

08:00.714 --> 08:03.648
rather than a washed up old
lady.

08:04.718 --> 08:06.651
Old lady.

08:08.889 --> 08:13.258
- Listen to me, you spoiled
little bitch!

08:14.695 --> 08:18.497
I am your goddamn mother!

08:20.100 --> 08:23.268
And you will show me some
respect.

08:25.906 --> 08:28.173
- I'll tell you what, Ma.
- What?

08:28.175 --> 08:30.075
- I'll show you the respect you
deserve

08:30.077 --> 08:32.677
when you give it to yourself.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.913
Patience, like a saint.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.551
Let's go, Thomas.

08:39.553 --> 08:41.986
(somber music)

08:45.993 --> 08:47.225
You have a great day.

08:47.227 --> 08:49.561
Come and give your mama some
love, muah!

08:51.198 --> 08:53.198
I'd better not get a
call from Mr. Kamaduchi

08:53.200 --> 08:55.267
about that choice of wardrobe
for school.

08:55.269 --> 08:57.135
- You won't, Mom, I promise.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.237
- What are you doing with that
old thing?

08:59.239 --> 09:00.872
I thought it was too small for
your head.

09:00.874 --> 09:03.608
- It is, I'm gonna give it to a
friend.

09:03.610 --> 09:05.277
Hey, guys, wait up.

09:06.246 --> 09:07.913
All right, I love you Mom.

09:07.915 --> 09:10.248
- Make sure you come right
home after school, okay?

09:10.250 --> 09:12.284
I got something special
planned for us tonight.

09:12.286 --> 09:13.552
- All right.

09:13.553 --> 09:14.819
- And Saturday's the bike fest
fair.

09:14.821 --> 09:16.288
I want you there, little man.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.756
- I thought we were
gonna go see my father.

09:17.758 --> 09:19.591
- Mm-mm, not this weekend.

09:19.593 --> 09:21.393
Maybe next.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.194
- Okay good, 'cause I really
don't like going there.

09:23.196 --> 09:24.029
- Love you.

09:24.031 --> 09:25.230
- Bye Mom.
- Bye.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.599
- Hi Mrs. Nation.
- Hey.

09:27.601 --> 09:30.235
(birds chirping)

09:31.838 --> 09:33.238
- Hey guys, I'll catch up.

09:38.345 --> 09:39.611
There you go.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.746
And you can have this too.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.281
All right, have a good day.

09:45.118 --> 09:47.786
(gentle music)

09:55.896 --> 09:59.965
- You know, you gotta forgive
her.

10:02.035 --> 10:06.938
She never really learned
how to express herself.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.074
Half the time, or probably a
good deal

10:09.076 --> 10:11.376
more than half the time it's the
alcohol.

10:12.846 --> 10:13.745
And...

10:17.217 --> 10:19.784
I wish sometimes I could make
her happier,

10:21.755 --> 10:24.389
and I don't think I'm
doing the best I can,

10:24.391 --> 10:25.757
but I'll tell ya one thing,

10:25.759 --> 10:29.194
she is extremely proud of you,
as am I,

10:29.196 --> 10:33.365
and she loves you very,
very much, as do I.

10:33.367 --> 10:35.700
And you are gonna be something,

10:35.702 --> 10:37.302
and you know why?

10:37.304 --> 10:40.005
Because you are something
already.

10:42.776 --> 10:44.275
- It was a sad day for me

10:44.277 --> 10:47.312
when my husband, Vito, got
locked up.

10:48.115 --> 10:51.383
At first, he was big and strong,

10:51.385 --> 10:53.251
and treated me real good.

10:55.422 --> 10:57.722
But then the truth came out,

10:57.724 --> 10:59.924
and it became my worst
nightmare.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.294
Sign the fuckin' papers.

11:04.731 --> 11:08.299
On paper, Daddy owned the two
businesses with Vito, my ex.

11:08.301 --> 11:12.270
It was in his will that Vito
resign the business over to me.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.406
- I didn't sign 'em yet.

11:14.408 --> 11:15.807
- Okay, well I need you to.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.375
- I need my lawyer to look at
'em.

11:17.377 --> 11:19.811
- Oh for shit's sake,
just sign the damn papers.

11:19.813 --> 11:20.845
You at least owe me that.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.714
- You got a mouth today bitch?

11:22.716 --> 11:26.217
- You know something Vito,
growing up my daddy showed me

11:26.219 --> 11:28.319
the true beauty of a man.

11:28.321 --> 11:31.022
Shame on me for marrying you.

11:31.024 --> 11:35.326
You ain't nothin' but a
beefed up version of my mama.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.295
I need you to sign that shop
over to me

11:37.297 --> 11:39.698
before it gets lost in
other club earnings.

11:39.700 --> 11:40.899
- Alfonso knows that's yours.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.200
- In theory, yeah.

11:42.202 --> 11:45.136
But on paper it's yours with the
club.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.005
Everything that you've
earned is now the club's

11:47.007 --> 11:49.174
since you ain't ever gettin'
out.

11:49.176 --> 11:51.476
So if not for me, do it for your
son.

11:51.478 --> 11:53.311
The income will help me with
him.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.480
- Talk to Alfonso in the club.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.315
They still kicking down my
share, right?

11:57.317 --> 11:59.084
- I don't want their money!

11:59.086 --> 12:00.985
I don't want the money that way!

12:00.987 --> 12:02.420
I want my shop's earnings.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.989
You and my daddy started that
up.

12:04.991 --> 12:08.460
I just need you to sign
off on the fucking papers

12:08.462 --> 12:09.360
and that's it.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.396
- You having issues today?

12:11.398 --> 12:12.731
Riding the cotton pony?

12:12.733 --> 12:16.067
- Look, I'm raising Thomas.

12:17.003 --> 12:19.504
Your club is what got you in
here.

12:19.506 --> 12:22.107
Killing those people
for the sake of a club?

12:23.343 --> 12:26.010
I need you to sign those
papers, and that's it.

12:26.012 --> 12:27.812
I will continue to raise my kid.

12:27.814 --> 12:29.080
- Our kid!

12:29.082 --> 12:30.749
Don't forget that.

12:30.751 --> 12:32.517
I gave you a great life when I
was home.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.319
He was okay then, right?

12:34.321 --> 12:36.387
When I was active in the club.

12:36.389 --> 12:38.356
You didn't give a shit where
the money came from then,

12:38.358 --> 12:40.458
just as long as your
needs were taken care of.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.761
So don't talk to me about the
lifestyle.

12:42.763 --> 12:44.462
You were deep in it with
those dykes on bikes.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.431
Don't tell me what I should do
for you.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.500
Those days are dead, bitch.

12:48.502 --> 12:50.001
- You're right.

12:50.003 --> 12:51.136
I won't ask for me.

12:54.841 --> 12:55.674
Ever.

12:55.675 --> 12:56.508
But you will do it for your son.

12:57.811 --> 13:02.447
Sign the goddamn papers.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.818
Vito was the vice president
of Reino de la Furia

13:06.820 --> 13:08.887
when my daddy was president.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.255
He's my son's father.

13:11.424 --> 13:14.058
I guess we all do stupid
shit when we're young.

13:17.197 --> 13:19.998
It's gonna be 10% anywhere, sir.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.201
Yep, they get that back
as soon as they hit court.

13:23.203 --> 13:24.969
Okay, we're located at,

13:26.306 --> 13:27.205
hello?

13:29.242 --> 13:30.475
He just hung up on me.

13:30.477 --> 13:31.543
- Totally hate that.

13:32.546 --> 13:34.112
- Rude, man.
- Thank you!

13:35.849 --> 13:36.915
- Can I help you?

13:38.451 --> 13:39.551
- Yeah hi.
- Hi.

13:39.553 --> 13:42.854
You know those coupons
are 10 years old, right?

13:44.357 --> 13:46.024
- I'm looking for Bear.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.225
- And you are?

13:47.227 --> 13:48.827
- An old friend.

13:48.829 --> 13:50.295
My name is Bailey Daniels.

13:50.297 --> 13:52.430
He knows me as Junior, we served
together.

13:53.967 --> 13:56.434
(rock music)

14:03.009 --> 14:05.009
- So you've been out for six
months,

14:05.011 --> 14:07.378
and you just come to see me now?

14:07.380 --> 14:08.479
What the hell, man?

14:10.550 --> 14:12.450
- Trying to get my shit
together.

14:13.854 --> 14:15.937
You know it's sad.

14:15.938 --> 14:18.021
You do numerous tours, you
stick your neck out there

14:18.024 --> 14:21.025
every day, then you come back
here, you can't catch a break.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.393
- Right?

14:22.395 --> 14:23.428
- Nobody wants you.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.865
It's like you don't belong.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.366
You're not part of a
team that depends on you

14:28.368 --> 14:29.901
constantly for their safety.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.037
You're isolated out here.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.508
But, thank God I can still ink.

14:38.511 --> 14:41.179
Paid the bills while I was on
the road.

14:41.181 --> 14:42.513
- Well, maybe you're like me.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.618
Not cut out for the nine to
five.

14:46.620 --> 14:48.219
- Fuck no.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.255
- Fuck it, I'm putting different
music on.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.958
- Shit, you got skinny.
- Fuck you.

15:02.002 --> 15:03.168
- Alfonso.

15:03.169 --> 15:04.335
Nice to finally meet you.
- Same here.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.004
- Bear has talked to me a lot
about you.

15:06.006 --> 15:07.906
I feel like I already know you,

15:08.508 --> 15:09.908
and you know what?

15:09.910 --> 15:10.608
I like you.

15:11.645 --> 15:12.911
- He's a good man.

15:12.913 --> 15:13.611
- Yes.

15:16.516 --> 15:19.584
Bear told me about when
he and some of his men

15:19.586 --> 15:22.987
were trapped inside that burning
tank,

15:22.989 --> 15:25.490
and you ran back through the
flames,

15:25.492 --> 15:27.659
not scared for your life.

15:27.661 --> 15:29.594
Only thinking about the lives of
your men.

15:30.997 --> 15:32.997
You saved Bear's life.

15:32.999 --> 15:34.699
- Thank you, brother.

15:34.701 --> 15:37.602
- That is fucking heroic,
brother.

15:38.672 --> 15:39.570
Yes!

15:41.508 --> 15:46.244
In my book, superheroes don't
wear capes.

15:46.246 --> 15:47.712
They wear dog tags.

15:49.015 --> 15:49.714
Salud.

15:49.716 --> 15:50.982
- Salud.
- Salud.

15:51.718 --> 15:54.686
(bottles clink)

15:54.688 --> 15:57.655
¶ You make it all seem great ¶

15:57.657 --> 15:59.507
(speaks in foreign language)

15:59.508 --> 16:01.358
- Let's go to church.
- Yeah, let's go to church.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.361
¶ You were the one I turned to ¶

16:03.363 --> 16:08.433
- So Joseph sent another barrel
of cash, and instructions.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.368
- Who sends barrels of cash?

16:11.171 --> 16:12.337
- Who cares?

16:12.338 --> 16:13.504
He pays us a lot for protection,

16:13.506 --> 16:15.039
so we gotta honor his wishes.

16:16.376 --> 16:19.143
And I quietly disposed
of the Mikey situation.

16:20.513 --> 16:24.148
And lastly Vito, he sent
another 10 grand, that's it.

16:24.150 --> 16:25.483
- I have to go see Vito this
week

16:25.485 --> 16:28.386
to handle a situation for
Gloria.

16:29.122 --> 16:31.189
The man is sending money
to the club weekly,

16:31.191 --> 16:32.423
but nothing to his home.

16:34.227 --> 16:36.427
Do we know what he is
moving on the inside?

16:40.300 --> 16:44.002
Okay, all in favor of the
capitan,

16:44.004 --> 16:47.171
the Capitan Sharktooth
continuing his duties

16:47.173 --> 16:49.540
of cleaning up the tattoo
parlor.

16:50.510 --> 16:51.676
- I second.
- Aye.

16:51.678 --> 16:52.577
- Aye.

16:53.680 --> 16:54.612
- [Vince] Oh boy!

16:57.017 --> 16:58.549
- You've got the gig.

16:58.551 --> 16:59.751
- Super awesome.

16:59.753 --> 17:00.685
Super excited.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.287
I'm gonna go tell Gloria.

17:08.528 --> 17:09.727
- What's with that guy?

17:09.729 --> 17:11.729
- That's Vince, Vincey.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.665
He's very dear to the club.

17:14.666 --> 17:16.800
He is one of the originals.

17:16.803 --> 17:17.702
He

17:19.138 --> 17:21.806
took a bullet to the head to
protect me.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.473
- He's stuck at being a 12 year
old.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.777
I couldn't do it, live life like
that.

17:27.380 --> 17:30.648
Watch out when he's swinging
a rolled up sock, man.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.383
Dude's a beast.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.052
- When he starts smacking
you with that thing,

17:34.054 --> 17:36.054
the kid is relentless.

17:36.056 --> 17:37.355
(men chuckle)

17:37.357 --> 17:39.624
- Hey, okay okay.

17:39.626 --> 17:43.828
Bailey, we want you to know we
appreciate

17:43.830 --> 17:47.665
what you have done for
this great country of ours,

17:47.667 --> 17:50.201
and what you have done
for our brother Bear.

17:51.571 --> 17:54.739
I understand your isolation,
what you're going through,

17:55.842 --> 17:59.177
but we do not want you to
be alone anymore, no sir.

17:59.179 --> 18:02.713
We want you to be part of our
family.

18:02.715 --> 18:06.150
I put forth a motion that the
sergeant

18:06.152 --> 18:10.121
becomes a full member
of El Reino de la Furia,

18:10.123 --> 18:11.122
the Nation of Fire.

18:11.124 --> 18:12.356
- I second that.

18:12.358 --> 18:14.625
- No warrior such as you

18:14.627 --> 18:17.562
should ever have to be a
prospect, no no.

18:18.364 --> 18:20.398
You're family, full patch.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.732
All in favor?

18:21.734 --> 18:23.367
- Aye.
- Aye.

18:23.369 --> 18:25.203
(gavel bangs)

18:25.205 --> 18:28.106
(emotional music)

18:29.776 --> 18:30.875
- [Alfonso] Welcome amigo,
welcome.

18:41.387 --> 18:43.855
(man chuckles)

18:44.891 --> 18:45.790
- Excuse me!

18:49.796 --> 18:53.531
- Whoa, you are Pete the Big
Dude Jethro!

18:53.533 --> 18:55.800
I just read an article about
you!

18:55.802 --> 18:57.301
What are you doing here?

18:57.303 --> 18:58.636
- I'm just passing through.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.505
I need some gas and so--
- Stupid me.

19:00.507 --> 19:03.307
What else would you do at a gas
station?

19:03.309 --> 19:06.144
- Well actually I was lookin'
to get my car washed too.

19:06.146 --> 19:07.512
- Shit, you are the Big Dude.

19:07.514 --> 19:09.180
You can go in now if you like.

19:09.182 --> 19:10.915
I'll even dry your car off for
you.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.583
- How much do I owe you, kid?

19:12.585 --> 19:15.786
- I can't believe the Big
Dude is in my gas station!

19:15.788 --> 19:16.888
It's crazy.

19:18.158 --> 19:20.725
(eerie music)

19:26.933 --> 19:28.733
Why do they make them so loud?

19:28.735 --> 19:30.868
- So you can hear them coming.

19:35.308 --> 19:38.843
- Excuse me sir, could you
sign me an autograph please?

19:38.845 --> 19:40.545
- [Big Dude] Sure.

19:40.547 --> 19:43.814
- Sir, I love it when you
place the butts on their head.

19:45.218 --> 19:46.751
- You mean headbutts?

19:46.753 --> 19:48.653
- Headbutts, yes, headbutts.

19:48.655 --> 19:50.721
Looking very frightful.

19:50.723 --> 19:51.956
- Here you go.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.960
Is it all right if I take my car
in now?

19:55.962 --> 19:57.712
- No problem sir, no problem.

19:57.713 --> 19:59.463
You pull right up, and I
will wait for you at the exit

19:59.465 --> 20:01.566
to dry you off, Mr. Big Dude.

20:02.569 --> 20:05.303
(ominous music)

20:10.944 --> 20:13.778
(hammer thuds)

20:26.359 --> 20:28.726
(knocking)

20:28.728 --> 20:30.161
- We found him.

20:30.162 --> 20:31.595
We got the child molesting son
of a bitch.

20:32.865 --> 20:34.665
- [Gloria] What's going on?

20:34.667 --> 20:37.935
- They found a bad man
they were looking for.

20:37.937 --> 20:39.437
He's very bad.

20:43.509 --> 20:44.692
Very bad.

20:44.693 --> 20:45.876
He touched children, little
children.

20:45.878 --> 20:49.513
Hey Rascal, have you seen my
crayons?

20:49.515 --> 20:50.982
- Nope.

20:50.984 --> 20:52.717
- My crayons, not yours!

20:53.686 --> 20:56.320
(somber music)

20:59.359 --> 21:00.658
- Where am I?

21:00.660 --> 21:01.559
Who are you?

21:03.663 --> 21:04.562
- Alfonso.

21:07.267 --> 21:09.000
Oh, sorry.

21:09.002 --> 21:11.669
(men chuckling)

21:11.671 --> 21:14.939
This is my brother from
another mother, huh?

21:16.509 --> 21:18.976
You know, we were big fans of
yours, man.

21:20.013 --> 21:23.314
- I was actually at the
Nassau Coliseum back in '86

21:23.316 --> 21:25.283
when you put that hurtin' on
Pipa.

21:25.852 --> 21:26.684
It was fucking amazing.

21:26.686 --> 21:27.685
It was beautiful.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.387
- Who are you people?

21:29.389 --> 21:30.688
Is it money you want?

21:31.924 --> 21:33.357
You want money?

21:33.359 --> 21:35.559
I can give you money.

21:35.561 --> 21:36.694
What the hell's goin' on here?

21:36.696 --> 21:38.296
- Big Dude, chill.

21:38.898 --> 21:41.532
Chill, don't get all loud and
nasty.

21:41.534 --> 21:43.034
We don't like rudeness.

21:43.036 --> 21:43.934
- We, we?

21:44.971 --> 21:46.604
Who the hell is we?

21:48.074 --> 21:49.407
Who is we?

21:49.409 --> 21:50.875
Say something!

21:50.877 --> 21:53.878
(Big Dude sobbing)

21:55.948 --> 21:57.748
- Fee fi fo fum.

22:00.553 --> 22:02.853
I smell the blood of an
Englishman.

22:03.856 --> 22:06.457
Be he alive or be he dead,

22:07.360 --> 22:11.362
I'll grind his bones to make my
bread.

22:11.364 --> 22:12.663
You're not laughing.

22:12.665 --> 22:13.964
You don't like this?

22:14.967 --> 22:19.070
Should I fit you with some
concrete shoes?

22:19.072 --> 22:21.039
You remember that quote?

22:21.040 --> 22:23.007
I think you stated in Ring
Magazine

22:23.009 --> 22:25.409
when they asked you if you
were affiliated with the mob,

22:25.411 --> 22:29.980
you said, "Yeah, I'm going to

22:29.982 --> 22:32.783
"buy myself some concrete shoes
and,"

22:34.454 --> 22:35.986
well I don't remember what you
said,

22:35.988 --> 22:38.756
but I remember it was a stupid
comment.

22:39.625 --> 22:42.727
Don't you know there's
no such thing as mafia,

22:42.729 --> 22:45.563
just men determined to make good
business.

22:46.632 --> 22:47.565
Better business.

22:51.037 --> 22:55.106
You know Pete, I once caught a
rapist.

22:55.108 --> 22:57.408
Oh yeah, it's a true story.

22:57.410 --> 22:59.710
It was back in my old
country, my old neighborhood.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.879
I was maybe 15.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.048
It was with my uncle, my baby
brother.

23:05.151 --> 23:07.051
I was going to turn him
into the authorities

23:07.053 --> 23:09.453
but I knew two of the women he
raped, so

23:10.022 --> 23:11.122
I called them up.

23:12.725 --> 23:14.792
They did some nasty shit to him.

23:16.129 --> 23:16.961
Oh yeah.

23:16.963 --> 23:22.867
And then, then there was this
man from Glendale, New York.

23:24.137 --> 23:26.036
Always the first one with the
gadgets.

23:26.038 --> 23:30.541
He had the state of the art
movie theater in his own house.

23:31.577 --> 23:36.414
Remote control cars,
televisions, TVs with video
games.

23:37.583 --> 23:39.750
Mr. Electronic.

23:41.154 --> 23:45.489
Families trusted him to have
the kids come over and play.

23:45.491 --> 23:49.193
You know a place to hang out
like a modern day candy store,

23:49.195 --> 23:51.462
but then the rumors started.

23:51.464 --> 23:52.930
The allegations came.

23:53.900 --> 23:57.435
The man was arrested, and let
go.

23:58.171 --> 24:02.039
Hiding behind his celebrity,
claiming people were trying

24:02.041 --> 24:05.126
to extort money from him.

24:05.127 --> 24:08.212
I remember he stated that
it was very painful for him,

24:09.182 --> 24:13.117
that financially he
was sacrificing so much

24:13.119 --> 24:15.152
because nobody would hire him.

24:15.154 --> 24:18.522
(Big Dude whimpering)

24:18.524 --> 24:21.492
Not as painful as being
molested, huh?

24:21.494 --> 24:23.344
- No.

24:23.345 --> 24:25.195
- Especially if you're seven
years old.

24:26.632 --> 24:28.499
- [Big Dude] No, please, no.

24:28.501 --> 24:31.235
- You never recovered from that.

24:32.138 --> 24:35.973
So tell me Pete, why
do you people do this?

24:37.176 --> 24:38.843
I want to know.

24:38.845 --> 24:40.110
- I didn't do it.

24:41.180 --> 24:44.114
(snaps fingers)

24:51.023 --> 24:51.922
No.

24:53.259 --> 24:55.259
I didn't do anything.

24:56.162 --> 24:58.128
- Do you know why you're here?

24:58.130 --> 24:59.230
- No.

25:00.199 --> 25:02.032
- No, no idea?
- No.

25:02.034 --> 25:04.869
- No, it's all a mystery to you.

25:04.871 --> 25:07.872
(Big Dude sobbing)

25:15.181 --> 25:16.580
- I forgive you.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.521
I forgive you.

25:23.523 --> 25:24.188
- Let me go.

25:28.861 --> 25:31.762
It wasn't me, no it wasn't me.

25:37.169 --> 25:39.303
- So do you know why you're here
now?

25:41.073 --> 25:42.540
- Yes.

25:42.542 --> 25:43.207
- Oh you do?

25:46.579 --> 25:48.078
That seven year old

25:49.315 --> 25:50.214
was Corrina.

25:52.184 --> 25:53.217
My baby girl.

25:55.955 --> 25:58.556
Pete, that's not very good
begging.

25:58.558 --> 26:00.002
- Please!

26:00.003 --> 26:01.447
- I'm going to tell you
something.

26:01.448 --> 26:02.892
- Please!
- Whatever you're afraid of

26:02.895 --> 26:06.230
right now, I promise you this
is going to get much worse.

26:09.201 --> 26:10.167
I promise.

26:10.168 --> 26:11.134
And I'm going to sit right here,

26:11.137 --> 26:12.903
and I'm going to watch the whole
thing.

26:12.905 --> 26:17.975
(Big Dude whimpering)
(suspenseful music)

26:26.352 --> 26:28.586
- Pretend it was your kid.

26:29.288 --> 26:32.623
(Big Dude screaming)

26:55.615 --> 26:56.113
- Die, die!

27:00.219 --> 27:01.318
- Hey love.

27:01.320 --> 27:02.920
Did you do your homework?

27:06.359 --> 27:07.175
- Yep.

27:07.176 --> 27:07.992
- I wish you would pay more
attention

27:07.994 --> 27:09.793
to school than this game.

27:09.795 --> 27:11.362
- Okay Mom, I'm trying to play.

27:11.364 --> 27:12.262
Go!

27:25.144 --> 27:26.043
- Whoa.

27:26.846 --> 27:29.947
The images, they're so real.

27:29.948 --> 27:33.049
They're so much more
real than the Atari 2600.

27:33.252 --> 27:35.219
- What's Atari 2600?

27:36.989 --> 27:37.888
- Never mind.

27:40.993 --> 27:44.228
I have meeting tomorrow,

27:44.230 --> 27:46.397
so Mr. De Gaines,

27:47.433 --> 27:50.200
he's going to drive you to
school.

27:50.202 --> 27:51.702
Your mother, she has,

27:52.705 --> 27:54.438
well something else to do.

28:00.346 --> 28:04.148
I put a little spending money

28:04.150 --> 28:06.316
right over there on your books.

28:06.318 --> 28:07.751
- I wanna work with you.

28:07.753 --> 28:10.120
- Oh Corrina, my baby girl.

28:10.122 --> 28:12.156
We've had this conversation
before.

28:14.694 --> 28:16.294
- I am not a child.

28:16.295 --> 28:17.895
- These are words I don't
want coming out of your mouth.

28:17.897 --> 28:20.464
- You've raised me since
birth on this life.

28:20.466 --> 28:22.800
I paid extra attention to you.

28:22.802 --> 28:24.368
- You want to learn?

28:24.370 --> 28:26.203
You think it's easy, what I do?

28:27.039 --> 28:30.374
This is not a life I want my
daughter to be involved in.

28:30.376 --> 28:31.875
Too much blood money.

28:31.877 --> 28:34.011
I would prefer it if you were a
doctor.

28:34.013 --> 28:35.979
- I can do this.

28:35.981 --> 28:38.716
- [Josip] Oh you can do this?

28:38.718 --> 28:40.718
- I'm ready to do this.

28:40.720 --> 28:41.485
- Oh you're ready?

28:42.488 --> 28:43.420
You're ready.

28:46.358 --> 28:47.241
Okay.

28:47.242 --> 28:48.125
Well this changes everything.

28:49.462 --> 28:52.096
Tomorrow you will get your
orders.

28:53.866 --> 28:54.732
Okay?

28:54.734 --> 28:59.036
You do not get a pass
because you are my daughter.

28:59.038 --> 29:02.106
You will do every test that is
asked of you, you understand?

29:03.142 --> 29:06.143
- I understand.
- Do you understand?

29:06.145 --> 29:07.044
- Yes.

29:07.046 --> 29:09.913
- Good, 'cause this is
not like your video game

29:09.915 --> 29:12.249
where you can press the reset
button.

29:12.251 --> 29:15.152
Once you cross that line,
there is no turning back.

29:15.888 --> 29:16.787
You understand?

29:18.991 --> 29:20.224
- I can do this.

29:20.226 --> 29:23.127
(emotional music)

29:33.873 --> 29:35.305
- My Corrina has gone,

29:36.976 --> 29:39.777
and a new soldier has been born.

29:41.981 --> 29:44.148
Okay, new soldier.

29:44.150 --> 29:46.950
Go pick up the money from
the books and bring it to me.

29:55.561 --> 29:59.530
From now on, you earn your
money.

30:08.841 --> 30:11.441
(birds chirping)

30:16.148 --> 30:17.031
- Boo.

30:17.032 --> 30:17.915
- Ma, I hate when you do that.

30:17.917 --> 30:19.083
- [Gloria] You about done?

30:19.084 --> 30:20.250
- Yeah, I'm just finishing up
this project

30:20.252 --> 30:22.386
for tomorrow's economics class.

30:22.388 --> 30:24.221
Mr. Somatis gave us all this
assignment

30:24.223 --> 30:26.290
on running a funeral
parlor into the ground.

30:26.292 --> 30:27.391
We had to come up with ways

30:27.393 --> 30:29.059
to place the business in the
red.

30:29.061 --> 30:31.495
- God, what the hell kind
of assignment is that?

30:31.497 --> 30:34.498
- Well, we were each handed
this fictitious business.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.300
I asked for a tattoo parlor,

30:36.302 --> 30:38.535
but I was handed AJ's House of
Burial.

30:38.537 --> 30:40.571
So I made AJ, who runs the
funeral parlor,

30:40.573 --> 30:41.872
this alcoholic crook.

30:41.874 --> 30:43.874
He's a sad and terrible
salesman,

30:43.876 --> 30:45.375
he has poor business sense,

30:45.377 --> 30:47.411
and well, he tries to stay
afloat

30:47.413 --> 30:50.914
by stealing people's credit
cards and overpriced caskets.

30:50.916 --> 30:53.517
- Sounds like this guy just
needs a rope to hang from.

30:54.553 --> 30:56.520
- Mom, when I die,

30:56.522 --> 31:00.290
can you cremate me and
bury my ashes near Pop-Pop?

31:00.292 --> 31:02.626
- Hey, stop that talk!

31:02.628 --> 31:04.628
You're gonna outlive me.

31:04.630 --> 31:06.997
So when I die, you can cremate
me

31:06.999 --> 31:09.566
and put my ashes by Pop-Pop,
okay?

31:09.568 --> 31:11.535
- Mom, promise me, I'm serious.

31:11.537 --> 31:12.870
- Thomas!

31:12.872 --> 31:14.404
- [Thomas] Promise!

31:14.406 --> 31:15.906
- I promise.

31:15.908 --> 31:18.008
I promise!

31:18.010 --> 31:20.210
Now promise me you'll do the
same.

31:20.212 --> 31:21.445
I wanna pinky swear.

31:23.649 --> 31:24.548
Okay.

31:26.518 --> 31:27.417
- Okay.

31:40.132 --> 31:43.066
(knocking)

31:43.068 --> 31:44.501
- [Mikey] Hang on a second!

31:44.503 --> 31:46.370
- [Corrina] Hey it's me, it's
Corrina.

31:49.675 --> 31:53.644
- You have a great day, come
give your mama some love, muah.

31:53.646 --> 31:55.479
Gonna be late.

31:55.481 --> 31:56.613
- I should've stayed home today.

31:56.615 --> 31:58.615
I mean, most of the teachers are
away

31:58.617 --> 32:00.617
at a dorky teacher con anyway.

32:01.654 --> 32:04.421
(suspenseful music)

32:08.527 --> 32:13.597
- [Man] Hey.

32:14.166 --> 32:15.699
- Here's your lunch.

32:16.702 --> 32:18.185
Hey.

32:18.186 --> 32:19.669
Who's that little girl
you talk to every day?

32:19.672 --> 32:21.038
The one you gave your helmet to?

32:21.040 --> 32:22.139
- Oh, she's Georgia.

32:22.141 --> 32:23.473
She's cool.

32:23.475 --> 32:25.342
I think she's homeless,

32:25.343 --> 32:27.210
but she really likes your
PB&J sandwiches by the way.

32:28.180 --> 32:29.246
- I'm gonna be late.

32:32.051 --> 32:34.151
- Is she really homeless?

32:34.153 --> 32:36.019
- I mean, ah,

32:36.021 --> 32:37.287
she's there in the mornings

32:37.289 --> 32:39.256
and then she's there when we get
out

32:39.258 --> 32:41.725
and one person caught her
peeping into the windows.

32:41.727 --> 32:44.494
I just don't really know.

32:46.498 --> 32:47.731
- I love you.

32:47.733 --> 32:48.632
Get going.

32:53.138 --> 32:55.572
(trunk creaks)

32:56.575 --> 32:58.608
- You wanna earn respect?

32:58.610 --> 32:59.710
Sell hard.

33:03.983 --> 33:05.048
- Take care.

33:10.089 --> 33:11.154
- Hey Thomas!

33:12.758 --> 33:13.657
I love ya!

33:25.604 --> 33:29.306
- For your protection,
in case you need it.

33:29.308 --> 33:30.207
Our secret.

33:31.677 --> 33:32.743
Don't tell your dad.

33:37.149 --> 33:39.783
(trunk creaks)

33:46.025 --> 33:47.324
- Truly blows.

33:47.326 --> 33:48.725
We should just stay home today.

33:48.727 --> 33:51.328
- I know, I begged my
mom to let me stay home,

33:51.330 --> 33:53.630
but she forced me to be here.

33:53.632 --> 33:55.699
Thank got we have Somatis,
then we get to go home.

33:56.802 --> 33:58.235
- You want one?

33:58.236 --> 33:59.669
- Oh god no, I tried one of
those earlier.

33:59.671 --> 34:00.804
They taste like shit.

34:00.806 --> 34:01.671
Where'd you get 'em?

34:04.376 --> 34:05.442
- Rich girl, Corrina.

34:05.444 --> 34:07.210
She was throwing 'em at us in
gym.

34:07.780 --> 34:09.379
- She's in my next class.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.313
We both have Somatis.

34:11.315 --> 34:13.183
- I do too, but Somatis left
this morning.

34:13.185 --> 34:15.452
He had some kind of an
emergency.

34:15.454 --> 34:18.755
His sister's store got
shot up or something.

34:18.757 --> 34:19.589
It's sad.

34:19.591 --> 34:20.791
- Jesus!

34:20.793 --> 34:24.061
(suspenseful music)

34:32.838 --> 34:34.838
- My name is Mr. Harper.

34:34.840 --> 34:37.174
Now some of you guys
know me from automotive.

34:37.842 --> 34:39.609
Mr. Somatis had an emergency,

34:39.610 --> 34:42.579
so I'm keeping my eye on class
today.

34:43.382 --> 34:44.781
You guys are lucky.

34:44.783 --> 34:48.185
You get to do nothing
for the next 45 minutes.

34:48.187 --> 34:51.254
(suspenseful music)

35:39.204 --> 35:40.337
- [Josip] Once you cross that
line,

35:40.339 --> 35:41.905
there is no turning back.

35:41.907 --> 35:45.175
(suspenseful music)

35:57.789 --> 36:00.657
(gunfire rattles)

36:00.659 --> 36:03.326
(somber music)

36:39.898 --> 36:42.899
(kids screaming)

36:59.985 --> 37:02.686
(gun firing)

37:08.994 --> 37:11.595
(gun fires)

37:28.513 --> 37:30.880
(sirens wail)

37:35.487 --> 37:38.021
(people screaming)

37:38.023 --> 37:40.690
(somber music)

37:52.004 --> 37:53.737
- I'm Gloria Nation.

38:09.821 --> 38:12.656
(Gloria wailing)

38:12.658 --> 38:13.657
Bear, Bear!

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
- Motherfucker!

38:24.002 --> 38:25.769
What did you do?

38:25.771 --> 38:26.970
What did you do?

38:34.012 --> 38:37.047
(Gloria sobbing)

38:53.498 --> 38:56.333
(birds chirping)

39:00.072 --> 39:01.938
- There you are.

39:01.940 --> 39:03.740
I was wondering where you went.

39:05.377 --> 39:06.076
Here.

39:08.947 --> 39:11.448
How are you holdin' up?

39:11.450 --> 39:13.016
- Still surreal.

39:13.018 --> 39:15.085
- Yeah, well it's only been
what,

39:16.588 --> 39:18.021
six weeks?

39:18.023 --> 39:18.988
It'll ease soon.

39:20.625 --> 39:25.528
When CW left, do you know
it took me nearly three

39:27.532 --> 39:29.766
goddamn years to deal with it?

39:31.870 --> 39:32.769
- Yeah.

39:37.042 --> 39:40.944
- You're gonna see and
hear things every day

39:40.946 --> 39:42.612
that remind you of Tommy.

39:43.949 --> 39:46.983
Hell, I still do every day with
CW.

39:46.985 --> 39:49.619
But I realize

39:49.621 --> 39:50.687
that his soul

39:53.658 --> 39:54.724
left this world.

39:57.162 --> 39:58.061
- Mama?

39:59.131 --> 40:00.948
- [Myra] What?

40:00.949 --> 40:02.766
- I don't know if I can
make it without my baby boy.

40:06.538 --> 40:08.838
- [Myra] That boy always made me
smile.

40:12.444 --> 40:13.576
- Still does.

40:14.546 --> 40:17.714
¶ Whenever you are sad and blue
¶

40:17.716 --> 40:22.786
¶ No one to tell your troubles
to ¶

40:23.822 --> 40:26.456
¶ Remember me ¶

40:26.458 --> 40:30.193
¶ I'm the one who loves you ¶

40:31.496 --> 40:34.998
- You used to sing that
to me when I was a baby.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.166
- [Myra] Oh yes I did.

40:36.168 --> 40:38.435
That stupid song.

40:39.070 --> 40:40.854
You remember it, huh?

40:40.855 --> 40:42.639
I'm so surprised that you
remember it.

40:42.641 --> 40:45.175
- That's my favorite, Mama.

40:45.177 --> 40:49.045
- Do you know that song always
put a smile on your face?

40:50.549 --> 40:52.165
Yeah.

40:52.166 --> 40:53.782
Anytime my little girl was
upset,

40:56.054 --> 40:56.953
that song

40:58.757 --> 40:59.722
always put a smile

41:02.127 --> 41:04.861
on that beautiful, beautiful
face.

41:08.834 --> 41:09.699
Aww.

41:13.038 --> 41:14.137
Help me up.

41:14.139 --> 41:15.638
You know what?

41:15.640 --> 41:18.007
I wanna give you something.

41:18.009 --> 41:21.244
(gentle guitar music)

41:27.953 --> 41:30.086
- You told me you got rid
of this after Pop-Pop died.

41:30.088 --> 41:31.921
- I know, I know.

41:31.923 --> 41:35.758
Child, I told you many things.

41:37.128 --> 41:41.064
Sometimes it was to protect you.

41:42.267 --> 41:44.033
Look around, see everything?

41:45.871 --> 41:48.204
Pretty much everything in here
was his,

41:49.674 --> 41:50.707
and now it's yours.

41:52.043 --> 41:53.209
Whatever you want.

41:54.546 --> 41:56.179
Just take it.

41:57.682 --> 41:59.148
- What's the matter, baby girl?

41:59.150 --> 42:00.967
- I can't do it.

42:00.968 --> 42:02.785
Please put the training
wheels back on, Pop-Pop.

42:02.787 --> 42:04.153
- What do you mean you can't do
it?

42:04.155 --> 42:06.289
You have to try again.

42:06.291 --> 42:08.658
You can't just quit.

42:09.594 --> 42:10.727
Listen to me.

42:12.230 --> 42:14.163
Life is about courage.

42:15.267 --> 42:18.268
It takes courage to get back on
the bike,

42:18.270 --> 42:20.703
but you have to try it again.

42:20.705 --> 42:22.272
You don't ever wanna quit.

42:27.812 --> 42:30.313
- Yes, even the bike.

42:31.716 --> 42:34.584
Do you know he actually built
that for the Day of Unity?

42:36.154 --> 42:37.053
- No.

42:39.024 --> 42:43.660
- He had this crazy concept.

42:43.662 --> 42:48.731
One day I would love to see
every biker--

42:49.167 --> 42:50.300
- Come together.

42:50.302 --> 42:55.038
No race problem, no club
problems,

42:55.040 --> 43:00.276
no arguments, no fights,
no nastiness among 'em.

43:00.278 --> 43:02.278
Just forget all that, put it
aside

43:02.280 --> 43:04.714
and remember the key word,
biker.

43:04.716 --> 43:08.718
The only thing you'd have
in common then would be

43:08.720 --> 43:12.255
the openness of the road, riding
your bike

43:12.257 --> 43:15.224
with the free wind
hitting you in the face.

43:16.227 --> 43:19.195
That's what it is, true bikers

43:19.197 --> 43:23.800
because what that is is
whether they're guy bikers,

43:23.802 --> 43:25.268
girl bikers, whatever it is

43:25.270 --> 43:29.205
they're banding together
for a common cause.

43:29.207 --> 43:33.142
Peace, love, and above all else,

43:33.144 --> 43:34.043
- [Both] Unity.

43:38.350 --> 43:39.248
- That

43:42.053 --> 43:43.920
was your daddy.

43:44.990 --> 43:45.955
Come here.

43:45.957 --> 43:47.657
- You sounded just like him.

43:47.659 --> 43:49.258
- Oh come here, you silly girl.

43:54.265 --> 43:55.832
- [Gloria] Thank you.

43:55.834 --> 43:58.401
(blues music)

44:21.660 --> 44:23.993
(knocking)

44:27.432 --> 44:28.364
- Sure he's here?

44:31.302 --> 44:32.669
- Yeah, yeah.

44:37.342 --> 44:39.709
- [Bear] Hey Mikey, we need to
chat.

44:39.711 --> 44:40.810
- What's up man?

44:40.812 --> 44:41.711
- [Bear] Quickly.

44:42.280 --> 44:43.379
- [Mikey] Man.

44:46.084 --> 44:47.450
- We only got a couple of
minutes, man.

44:47.452 --> 44:48.351
He's gonna be here.

44:51.456 --> 44:52.455
- You guys want a beer?

44:54.292 --> 44:56.793
You know Vito had the greatest
idea with these things.

44:56.795 --> 45:00.830
You take 'em, and then you
dip 'em in the product.

45:00.832 --> 45:02.999
It's a fuckin' killer concept,
man.

45:07.305 --> 45:10.139
- Fuck, man!
- This ain't a social visit.

45:10.141 --> 45:12.909
What the fuck did Vito
get you mixed up in, man?

45:13.712 --> 45:17.113
Kids are dead because of
this shit you cooked up, man.

45:17.115 --> 45:19.048
Alfonso is pissed.

45:19.050 --> 45:21.017
He's on his way here.

45:21.019 --> 45:23.986
Now, if you listen to me I
can probably keep you alive.

45:23.988 --> 45:24.887
Where's your cut?

45:27.125 --> 45:29.325
- It's in the bedroom, I think,
why?

45:30.328 --> 45:32.929
I cut some of those with
formaldehyde.

45:32.931 --> 45:34.464
- [Rascal] Found it.

45:34.466 --> 45:35.398
- Toss it to Tripod.

45:36.468 --> 45:38.267
Now where is the money you made

45:38.269 --> 45:40.169
from this non-club venture,
Mikey?

45:45.844 --> 45:47.210
Holy shit!

45:48.179 --> 45:49.078
All that?

45:53.818 --> 45:56.786
When they walk in, you say
nothing.

45:57.956 --> 45:59.355
Listen to me.

45:59.357 --> 46:02.358
Let me do all the talking, say
nothing.

46:04.195 --> 46:05.161
I'll handle this.

46:08.466 --> 46:11.467
(knocking)

46:11.469 --> 46:12.368
Open the door.

46:18.376 --> 46:20.093
Start up a business like this

46:20.094 --> 46:21.811
without clearing it with us
first.

46:21.813 --> 46:24.781
Even if you were doing it with
the best intentions in mind.

46:25.817 --> 46:27.383
Alfonso has the last say!

46:29.554 --> 46:30.453
You know that.

46:31.389 --> 46:32.522
- Hi, Mikey.

46:35.994 --> 46:36.893
Hm, hm.

46:50.108 --> 46:51.240
Mikey, Mikey.

46:56.581 --> 46:59.182
What do we have here, Mikey?

47:02.821 --> 47:03.519
Ooh!

47:05.590 --> 47:06.489
Nice.

47:15.133 --> 47:17.867
(Alfonso sighs)

47:25.343 --> 47:26.342
How much is here?

47:29.147 --> 47:30.546
And how much in inventory?

47:40.091 --> 47:43.292
Are you listening to my
questions, huh?

47:43.294 --> 47:44.193
Dale.

47:46.631 --> 47:48.030
- He asked you a question.

47:51.603 --> 47:54.036
- You don't understand me,
right?

47:54.038 --> 47:57.607
Maybe, maybe we should
rephrase the questions.

47:58.543 --> 48:01.177
Like in the DMV when they ask
you

48:01.179 --> 48:04.347
the same simple questions
three, four times, right?

48:04.349 --> 48:05.514
- [Man] That's fine.

48:05.516 --> 48:08.351
(Alfonso laughs)

48:12.490 --> 48:16.192
- What are you doing in
this apartment, Mikey?

48:19.530 --> 48:22.031
What are you doing?

48:22.032 --> 48:24.533
Because it sure seems like
you're running some game here.

48:34.445 --> 48:36.579
- I'm not sure I heard the
question right.

48:40.685 --> 48:43.619
(Alfonso sighs)

48:44.656 --> 48:46.622
- You are done.

48:46.624 --> 48:49.458
(Mikey groans)

48:49.460 --> 48:51.494
- Alfonso, please, I swear,

48:51.496 --> 48:53.396
I didn't mean any disrespect.

48:53.397 --> 48:55.297
I was just trying to
do something on my own,

48:55.300 --> 48:58.334
and the money, the money is all
yours.

48:58.336 --> 48:59.602
Take it, and the product?

48:59.604 --> 49:01.271
Take it, take everything.

49:01.272 --> 49:02.939
I wanted to show you--
- Turn him around.

49:04.642 --> 49:07.276
Kids were killed eating this
shit.

49:07.278 --> 49:09.512
(ominous music)

49:09.514 --> 49:12.181
(Mikey groans)

49:20.124 --> 49:23.359
(gentle guitar music)

49:33.471 --> 49:36.372
(bottles clatter)

49:43.648 --> 49:46.282
(somber music)

50:03.668 --> 50:08.604
- They didn't give me a parade
when I came home neither.

50:09.640 --> 50:11.073
They called me baby killer.

50:12.543 --> 50:14.410
They spit on me like I was shit!

50:19.751 --> 50:22.251
I wanna give you something.

50:30.461 --> 50:32.028
Give me your hand.

50:34.432 --> 50:36.732
Thank you for your service.

50:39.637 --> 50:42.671
(dramatic music)

50:58.356 --> 51:00.823
(somber music)

51:22.447 --> 51:23.379
- Georgia, right?

51:24.749 --> 51:26.615
Hi, I'm Gloria.

51:27.785 --> 51:29.118
- Thomas's mom?

51:29.120 --> 51:30.186
Yeah, I know.

51:31.689 --> 51:33.789
I thought you were the
man in the Cadillac.

51:33.791 --> 51:35.791
- It's late for you to be out.

51:36.727 --> 51:38.761
Your family must be worried.

51:38.763 --> 51:40.329
Do you need a ride back?

51:40.331 --> 51:41.197
- No.

51:42.767 --> 51:44.567
My mom ran away with my uncle.

51:46.104 --> 51:47.736
My father dropped me off here.

51:48.539 --> 51:50.239
He said he was gonna get gas.

51:52.110 --> 51:54.844
He said he was gonna be right
back.

51:54.846 --> 51:56.479
- When did he leave?

51:56.481 --> 51:58.581
- A while ago, I guess.

52:02.753 --> 52:04.720
- Thomas used to love that
helmet.

52:06.591 --> 52:07.690
- Yeah, I know.

52:08.860 --> 52:11.627
And peanut butter and jelly
sandwiches.

52:11.629 --> 52:12.528
- Yes he did.

52:16.834 --> 52:19.668
- I saw it, all of it.

52:19.670 --> 52:22.204
All the way up to the man in the
Cadillac.

52:23.207 --> 52:25.241
- What, what did you see?

52:26.811 --> 52:27.877
Tell me, please.

52:32.150 --> 52:33.349
Please, just tell me.

52:33.351 --> 52:34.250
What did you see?

52:39.590 --> 52:40.656
- I was in the tree.

52:40.658 --> 52:44.593
I watched the man in the
Cadillac give the bad girl a
bag.

52:46.864 --> 52:49.665
She had guns, and candy.

52:51.802 --> 52:53.602
She shot the kids in the
classroom.

52:56.941 --> 52:58.407
Thomas tried to save them.

53:00.845 --> 53:01.944
He tried to stop her,

53:01.946 --> 53:06.882
but he shot the bad girl with
her own gun,

53:07.718 --> 53:11.520
and the security guard shot
Thomas.

53:12.423 --> 53:14.623
He must've thought that Thomas

53:14.625 --> 53:16.525
was the bad girl, but he wasn't.

53:17.461 --> 53:18.961
He tried to save them.

53:23.834 --> 53:26.936
- You said you thought I
was the man in the Cadillac.

53:26.938 --> 53:28.871
What did you mean by that?

53:31.676 --> 53:32.792
- He comes every night.

53:32.793 --> 53:33.909
Sometimes with men on
motorcycles.

53:35.680 --> 53:36.845
- The day of the shooting,

53:38.282 --> 53:38.981
where was he?

53:40.985 --> 53:42.451
- Right where he is now.

53:43.854 --> 53:46.589
(ominous music)

53:54.599 --> 53:56.298
- Oh, officer, thank God!

53:56.300 --> 53:57.866
- Ma'am, walk away from the girl
now.

53:57.868 --> 53:59.235
- No, but there's a man over
there--

53:59.237 --> 54:01.303
- Ma'am, step away from the girl
now.

54:02.940 --> 54:04.840
- There's a man--
- This is your last warning.

54:04.842 --> 54:06.809
Step away from the little girl.

54:06.811 --> 54:09.445
We don't want you, we want the
girl.

54:09.447 --> 54:11.380
Go back to the shop, Gloria.

54:12.350 --> 54:13.816
- Do I know you?
(Georgia screams)

54:13.818 --> 54:15.484
- Move out of the way.

54:15.486 --> 54:16.652
- Georgia, run!

54:16.654 --> 54:19.388
(intense music)

54:22.026 --> 54:26.962
Give me that, now run, over
there.

54:31.836 --> 54:33.969
(knocking)

54:35.973 --> 54:36.905
I need help.

54:41.879 --> 54:44.013
- You show up in the middle of
the night

54:44.015 --> 54:46.815
with some off the wall
story and some filthy kid?

54:49.620 --> 54:50.519
My god, woman.

54:52.556 --> 54:54.723
I get you've been through
some shit, okay I get it,

54:54.725 --> 54:56.025
but we are not friends!

54:57.028 --> 54:59.928
- I didn't have anywhere else to
go.

54:59.930 --> 55:01.930
I can't trust anybody else!

55:02.967 --> 55:05.301
I'm just asking you to
help me this one time!

55:05.303 --> 55:06.435
- We are not friends.

55:06.436 --> 55:07.568
I don't know why you're here.

55:07.571 --> 55:09.305
- If what Georgia saw is true,

55:09.307 --> 55:11.040
then this changes everything.

55:11.042 --> 55:13.742
My son is innocent!

55:13.744 --> 55:16.845
He was acting in self-defense!

55:16.847 --> 55:17.913
Help me on this.

55:17.915 --> 55:19.882
Rita, you gotta help me on this.

55:19.884 --> 55:21.350
- Come on, Rita, she's in
trouble

55:21.352 --> 55:23.052
and she's one of us.

55:23.054 --> 55:25.554
- No, see that's where y'all are
wrong.

55:25.556 --> 55:26.955
She left!

55:26.957 --> 55:30.059
She is the one that chose a new
life.

55:30.061 --> 55:31.894
She bailed.

55:31.896 --> 55:34.330
She's the one that turned
her back on her sisters.

55:34.332 --> 55:37.032
- Rita, it's my son!

55:37.034 --> 55:39.001
It would clear his name.

55:39.003 --> 55:40.536
- Not my problem.

55:40.537 --> 55:42.070
- Those bikers had our patches
on 'em.

55:42.073 --> 55:45.107
All of your patches, all
of our patches on 'em.

So this does pertain to you, and
you!

55:50.414 --> 55:51.113
All of us!

55:51.916 --> 55:53.515
Help me out this one time.

55:56.520 --> 55:58.087
- What's goin' on?

55:58.089 --> 55:59.488
- She got herself into some
trouble,

55:59.490 --> 56:02.391
but she's gonna go ahead
and get herself out.

56:02.393 --> 56:04.426
(knocking)

56:04.428 --> 56:05.561
See who's at the door.

56:06.630 --> 56:09.365
(ominous music)

56:13.938 --> 56:14.837
- It's a cop!

56:16.841 --> 56:18.807
- All right, all right.

56:18.809 --> 56:20.609
All right, all right.

56:20.610 --> 56:22.410
You and little miss sunshine go
upstairs.

56:22.413 --> 56:24.713
- Come on.

56:24.714 --> 56:27.014

be alert, watch the street.

56:28.452 --> 56:29.585
Just go get the door.

56:37.094 --> 56:39.128
- [Woman] Can I help you,
officer?

56:39.130 --> 56:42.164
- I'm sorry to bother ya.
- Come on in.

56:43.067 --> 56:45.234
- We're conducting a house to
house search

56:45.235 --> 56:47.402
for a felon and a child believed
to be armed and dangerous.

56:48.472 --> 56:50.973
(cop groans)

56:53.477 --> 56:55.844
- I know this prick, he ain't no
cop.

56:55.846 --> 56:57.146
He works down at the prison.

56:58.616 --> 57:03.786
(glass tinkles)
(intense music)

57:03.788 --> 57:06.722
(gun fires)

57:06.724 --> 57:08.174
The other's still back up the
street.

57:08.175 --> 57:09.625
- [Woman] What the hell
are we gonna do now?

57:11.629 --> 57:13.595
- We take care of our own.

57:13.597 --> 57:16.965
(gentle guitar music)

57:16.967 --> 57:18.100
- Absolutely, definitely.

57:19.203 --> 57:21.136
Gonna make a pickup for Alfonso.

57:21.138 --> 57:24.573
(gentle guitar music)

57:26.010 --> 57:27.376
- [Gloria] Wouldn't you rather

57:27.377 --> 57:28.743
have a drink with somebody else?

57:28.746 --> 57:30.179
- I go with my heart, lady.

57:31.048 --> 57:33.015
- Aw, Jojo I don't feel it.

57:33.017 --> 57:33.916
- I know.

57:34.819 --> 57:36.185
Just have a drink with me.

57:43.093 --> 57:45.194
Weird thing about life.

57:46.764 --> 57:49.665
How do you love someone when
you know you can't have 'em?

57:52.102 --> 57:54.536
I've known you pretty
much your whole life.

57:56.106 --> 57:57.573
Loved you from afar.

57:59.577 --> 58:02.177
But I respect the brotherhood,
and CW.

58:04.949 --> 58:06.215
I choose to keep my love for you

58:06.217 --> 58:09.218
as a brother would his sister.

58:11.822 --> 58:13.088
- Junior looks like he's
settling in

58:13.090 --> 58:15.190
pretty nicely, don't ya think?

58:16.627 --> 58:19.094
- He's the toughest son
of a bitch I've ever met.

58:24.268 --> 58:28.170
I got a couple clients
coming in, you want 'em?

58:29.073 --> 58:30.105
- Is it chicks?

58:30.107 --> 58:32.140
- [Bear] They're chicks.

58:32.142 --> 58:33.041
- Shit yeah.

58:33.944 --> 58:35.177
- I ain't tattooin' nobody.

58:36.914 --> 58:37.813
- Bailey.

58:38.749 --> 58:39.581
Take off the coat.

58:39.583 --> 58:40.816
- Shit, right, cool.

58:44.922 --> 58:47.256
- Well I'd better get Georgia
out of this atmosphere.

58:47.258 --> 58:49.758
Don't want her around this too
long.

58:49.760 --> 58:51.560
- [Bear] Yeah, that's
probably a good idea.

58:52.563 --> 58:54.663

away ¶

59:09.113 --> 59:10.245
- Hey.

59:10.247 --> 59:12.648
- I made this for you, Gloria.

59:14.151 --> 59:16.585
It's Thomas.

59:16.587 --> 59:21.323
You said he's an angel with
Pop-Pop now, in heaven.

59:23.227 --> 59:28.230
So I drew this for you of our
two angels

59:28.232 --> 59:33.268
to always be here, and that's
you.

59:50.821 --> 59:52.154
It's beautiful.

59:54.258 --> 59:56.358
- Did the captain do good?

59:56.360 --> 59:57.793
- Captain did great.

01:00:14.912 --> 01:00:15.811
- Hey Bear.

01:00:17.314 --> 01:00:19.982
I gotta go pick up my kid,
so Mitty's workin' late.

01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:22.317
You don't want that woman

01:00:22.318 --> 01:00:23.684
blowing up your cellphone, trust
me.

01:00:24.755 --> 01:00:25.754
- Do what you do, brother.

01:00:25.756 --> 01:00:26.772
Do what you do.

01:00:26.773 --> 01:00:27.789
I'll let you.
- All right.

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:30.292
- Lookin' great.

01:00:31.662 --> 01:00:32.361
Very talented.

01:00:37.267 --> 01:00:38.800
- Hey.

01:00:38.802 --> 01:00:40.018
- Hey.

01:00:40.019 --> 01:00:41.235
- So, I had to see some friends
today,

01:00:41.238 --> 01:00:43.772
and while I was there,

01:00:43.774 --> 01:00:47.275
I talked to Vito about him
signing the shop over to you.

01:00:47.277 --> 01:00:48.176
- And?

01:00:51.281 --> 01:00:52.714
- I tried.

01:00:52.715 --> 01:00:54.148
But, he did send you some money.

01:00:54.151 --> 01:00:55.350
- Thanks.

01:00:55.352 --> 01:00:56.284

(somber music)

01:01:20.911 --> 01:01:22.377
- My husband's in the courtyard.

01:01:38.095 --> 01:01:41.163
- This was Corrina's
favorite spot in the house.

01:01:42.399 --> 01:01:43.899
A good spot, I think.

01:01:46.103 --> 01:01:47.703
- [Woman] Mr. De Gaines called.

01:01:48.372 --> 01:01:51.039
He said he's at the
location, it's being handled.

(men grunting)

01:10:06.303 --> 01:10:07.202
- Come on.

01:10:11.908 --> 01:10:14.542
(men grunting)

01:10:24.487 --> 01:10:25.386
- Hey!

01:10:28.491 --> 01:10:31.392
(gunfire rattles)

01:10:32.862 --> 01:10:35.797
(ominous music)

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:45.940
(gun fires)

01:10:49.246 --> 01:10:51.479
- You sick fuck, what did you
do?

01:10:51.481 --> 01:10:54.849
- Oh, I have a little surprise
for you.

01:10:54.851 --> 01:10:56.835
- Where's the fucking girl?

01:10:56.836 --> 01:10:58.820
- Looks like you and I
have Mexican standoff.

01:10:58.822 --> 01:11:01.489
- Nah, we just have
another dead terrorist.

01:11:01.491 --> 01:11:03.725
(gun clicking)

01:11:03.727 --> 01:11:06.961
- What kind of soldier
doesn't check his own piece?

01:11:06.963 --> 01:11:09.897
(gun fires)

01:11:09.899 --> 01:11:12.300
Stupid fucking soldier.

01:11:12.302 --> 01:11:13.835
- Fuck you!

01:11:13.837 --> 01:11:16.337
- Nothing is what it seems huh,
nothing.

01:11:16.339 --> 01:11:17.972
- Fuck you!

01:11:17.973 --> 01:11:19.606
- Oh yes, why don't you come
over here

01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:22.310
and beat the shit out
of me, I'm so scared.

01:11:22.312 --> 01:11:24.579
Look at me, I'm shaking.

01:11:24.581 --> 01:11:25.847
Bet when you woke up this
morning,

01:11:25.849 --> 01:11:28.650
you didn't think today
would be like this, huh?

01:11:28.652 --> 01:11:31.653
You got up, took a shit, had a
shower,

01:11:31.655 --> 01:11:33.271
put on your clothes.

01:11:33.272 --> 01:11:34.888
You thought today would be
different,

01:11:34.891 --> 01:11:37.025
but I didn't think that, you
know why?

01:11:37.027 --> 01:11:38.426
Because I'm a businessman.

01:11:38.428 --> 01:11:40.528
I plan everything, I calculate.

01:11:41.965 --> 01:11:44.899
Hey, hot shot.

01:11:44.901 --> 01:11:47.335
Got a little surprise for you,
oh yeah.

01:11:48.605 --> 01:11:49.871
It's gonna blow your mind.

01:11:51.408 --> 01:11:53.408
Bear, stand up.

01:12:05.655 --> 01:12:06.954
- I'm sorry, bud.

01:12:08.058 --> 01:12:09.857
Cash truly is king.

01:12:12.629 --> 01:12:14.062
What the fuck is this?

01:12:14.064 --> 01:12:16.664
(gun fires)

01:12:17.667 --> 01:12:18.866
- [Josip] Yes, well.

01:12:20.437 --> 01:12:22.737
- [Bailey] Eat shit!

01:12:22.738 --> 01:12:25.038
- I never trust anyone who
would betray a friend for money.

01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:28.976
We're not so much different, you
and I.

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:31.679
We're both soldiers.

01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:32.747
- I'm not a soldier.

01:12:33.650 --> 01:12:34.849
I'm a Marine.

01:12:34.851 --> 01:12:37.418
- Oh yes, that's right, you're a
Marine.

01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:38.853
Big fucking Marine.

01:12:40.056 --> 01:12:41.823
Whose cause do you fight for,
huh?

01:12:41.825 --> 01:12:43.858
Yours or theirs?

01:12:45.061 --> 01:12:47.829
You have all these medals
on your neck and your chest.

01:12:47.831 --> 01:12:50.732
You come home, you're a
stranger in your own country.

01:12:51.935 --> 01:12:53.034
For what?

01:12:54.804 --> 01:12:56.738
My friend, money wins.

01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:58.406
So checkmate, motherfucker.

01:13:00.143 --> 01:13:02.744
(gun fires)

01:13:05.482 --> 01:13:08.483
(percussive music)

01:13:25.502 --> 01:13:27.902
(gun fires)

01:13:34.944 --> 01:13:37.745
(dramatic music)

01:13:44.788 --> 01:13:45.686
- Hey.

01:13:47.490 --> 01:13:48.723
- Stay with us.

01:13:48.725 --> 01:13:50.091
Help is on the way.

01:13:50.093 --> 01:13:52.160
Where's Georgia?

01:13:52.162 --> 01:13:55.129
(Georgia screaming)

01:13:55.131 --> 01:13:57.799
(somber music)

01:14:11.948 --> 01:14:14.682
(intense music)

01:14:18.121 --> 01:14:20.521
(gun fires)

01:14:22.959 --> 01:14:24.625
(gun fires)

01:14:24.627 --> 01:14:27.628
(triumphant music)

01:14:54.824 --> 01:14:57.191
(blues music)

01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:20.047
(people chattering)

01:15:54.584 --> 01:15:57.151
(eerie music)

01:16:10.099 --> 01:16:11.999
- Hey, send this out for me?

01:16:14.203 --> 01:16:15.336
- I'll send this out today.

01:16:15.338 --> 01:16:17.605
By the way, you've got a
visitor.

01:16:17.607 --> 01:16:19.357
You know the routine.

01:16:19.358 --> 01:16:21.108
Stand, extend your hands through
the bars.

01:16:25.915 --> 01:16:27.098
- Who?

01:16:27.099 --> 01:16:28.282
- Blonde, guess it's your wife.

01:16:34.123 --> 01:16:36.057
All right, let's go.

01:16:41.598 --> 01:16:44.131
(ominous music)

01:16:50.306 --> 01:16:51.639
- What time you guys got?

01:16:54.644 --> 01:16:55.343
My wife.

01:16:59.048 --> 01:17:01.082
- This is for Jorge.

01:17:01.084 --> 01:17:06.153
Reino de la Furia, hermano.

01:17:08.091 --> 01:17:10.825
(shiv clatters)

01:17:12.762 --> 01:17:15.830
(people chattering)

01:17:17.033 --> 01:17:20.267
(doorbell rings)

01:17:20.269 --> 01:17:22.136
(knocking)

01:17:22.138 --> 01:17:25.306
(gentle piano music)

01:17:38.154 --> 01:17:39.954
- [Gloria] The night Vito was
killed,

01:17:39.956 --> 01:17:42.690
he had signed the paperwork
that he was holding onto.

01:17:43.726 --> 01:17:46.193
I guess it was the guilt
of knowing a side business

01:17:46.195 --> 01:17:47.728
you orchestrated from prison

01:17:47.730 --> 01:17:49.930
caused your son to lose his
life.

01:17:59.308 --> 01:18:02.043
(door whirring)

01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:11.318
- Well?

01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:35.943
So you just gonna admire
her, or you gonna mount her?

01:18:40.116 --> 01:18:42.783
(upbeat music)

01:19:02.939 --> 01:19:05.339
¶ There's another ¶

01:19:05.341 --> 01:19:08.275
¶ Ride to nowhere ¶

01:19:08.277 --> 01:19:13.347
¶ Yeah the wind keeps calling my
name ¶

01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:17.051
¶ We all want the freedom ¶

01:19:17.053 --> 01:19:19.887

01:19:19.889 --> 01:19:21.922
¶ Sometimes we think that ¶

01:19:21.924 --> 01:19:25.960
¶ There's nothing left to gain ¶

01:19:25.962 --> 01:19:30.097
¶ Uh-Huh ¶

01:19:30.099 --> 01:19:35.169
¶ It can't be so wrong
when it feels so right ¶

01:19:35.338 --> 01:19:40.407
¶ Can't be so wrong if
I wanna be an outlaw ¶

01:19:41.377 --> 01:19:46.247
¶ It'll be so wrong if
I could never find you ¶

01:19:46.249 --> 01:19:50.518
¶ Ever again ¶

01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:52.419
¶ America is nothing ¶

01:19:52.421 --> 01:19:54.088
¶ Without the red white and blue
¶

01:19:54.090 --> 01:19:58.392
¶ In the hearts of me and you ¶

01:19:58.394 --> 01:20:03.030
¶ Hey yeah ¶

01:20:07.270 --> 01:20:09.403
¶ All the miles ¶

01:20:09.405 --> 01:20:12.873
¶ Leave a trail ¶

01:20:12.875 --> 01:20:17.945
¶ All our brothers and
sisters never fail ¶

01:20:18.447 --> 01:20:21.248
¶ I found our heroes ¶

01:20:21.250 --> 01:20:24.351
¶ They're everywhere ¶

01:20:24.353 --> 01:20:27.221
¶ On the porches ¶

01:20:27.223 --> 01:20:30.191
¶ Living out the days ¶

01:20:30.193 --> 01:20:34.395
¶ Oh yeah ¶

01:20:34.397 --> 01:20:39.466
¶ Can't be so wrong if it feels
so right ¶

01:20:39.869 --> 01:20:44.939
¶ Can't be so wrong if
I wanna be an outlaw ¶

01:20:45.541 --> 01:20:50.477
¶ It would be so wrong if
I could never find you ¶

01:20:50.479 --> 01:20:54.982
¶ Ever again ¶

01:20:54.984 --> 01:20:56.517
¶ America is nothing ¶

01:20:56.519 --> 01:20:58.452
¶ Without the red white and blue
¶

01:20:58.454 --> 01:21:02.556
¶ In the hearts of me and you ¶

01:21:15.571 --> 01:21:20.441
¶ It can't be so wrong

¶ Can't tell me right
can't tell me wrong ¶

01:21:50.273 --> 01:21:55.342
¶ Can't tell me right
can't tell me wrong ¶

01:21:55.978 --> 01:21:57.389
¶ Can't tell ¶

01:21:57.390 --> 01:21:58.801
- [Gloria] I'll always have the
spirit

01:21:58.802 --> 01:22:00.213
of my son and my daddy
with me wherever I go.

01:22:01.450 --> 01:22:05.352
As for me, I am the phoenix.

01:22:06.389 --> 01:22:08.989
When it feels it's face
to face with death,

01:22:10.526 --> 01:22:12.026
it recycles its life.

01:22:13.262 --> 01:22:14.328
A new beginning.

01:22:14.330 --> 01:22:20.267
As it reemerges from its own
ashes, totally reborn, renewed.

01:22:23.239 --> 01:22:24.972
I am very much alive.

01:22:26.676 --> 01:22:30.644
I am Gloria Nation, ready
to fight another fight.

01:22:32.615 --> 01:22:33.614
Until then.

01:22:38.587 --> 01:22:41.655
¶ Lordy lordy lordy ¶

01:22:43.392 --> 01:22:45.726
- Actually, you know what
I'd like to see one day?

01:22:45.728 --> 01:22:49.296
All bikers come together,

01:22:49.298 --> 01:22:54.301
peace, love, and above all else,
unity.

01:22:54.303 --> 01:22:57.538
(gentle guitar music)

01:23:12.755 --> 01:23:16.557
¶ Not a soul in sight just
morning light ¶

01:23:16.559 --> 01:23:20.060
¶ Shining in the shadows
pretty as a diamond ¶

01:23:20.062 --> 01:23:23.430
¶ God blessed me with an open
road ¶

01:23:23.432 --> 01:23:28.002
¶ I'm going where the hell I
wanna go ¶

01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:39.380
¶ Open road ¶

01:23:40.216 --> 01:23:45.285
¶ Open road ¶

01:23:45.554 --> 01:23:50.624
¶ Ah ¶

01:23:53.662 --> 01:23:57.197
¶ Sleek and strong and all night
long ¶

01:23:57.199 --> 01:24:00.634
¶ We're goin' goin' goin'
'til the goin' gets gone ¶

01:24:00.636 --> 01:24:02.102
¶ Don't ask where I'm headed ¶

01:24:02.104 --> 01:24:03.704
¶ I don't know ¶

01:24:03.706 --> 01:24:08.475
¶ I'm going where the hell I
wanna go ¶

01:24:14.250 --> 01:24:19.319
¶ Open road ¶

01:24:20.623 --> 01:24:25.692
¶ Open road ¶

01:24:29.298 --> 01:24:34.368
¶ Have you ever felt your
feet when they feel free ¶

01:24:34.703 --> 01:24:39.773
¶ Running on them pavement here

01:24:41.143 --> 01:24:46.213
¶ Searching for a chance to get
away ¶

01:24:48.551 --> 01:24:53.620
¶ Begging to make a change ¶

01:24:54.323 --> 01:24:59.393
¶ But the only time I
feel like I am free ¶

01:24:59.662 --> 01:25:01.695
¶ Is when I hit the ¶

¶ Open road ¶

01:25:07.236 --> 01:25:10.204
¶ Oh the open road ¶

01:25:13.709 --> 01:25:16.410
¶ Oh the open road ¶
¶ Not a soul in sight ¶

01:25:16.412 --> 01:25:18.312
¶ Just golden light ¶

01:25:18.314 --> 01:25:21.715
¶ Shining in the shadows
pretty as a diamond ¶

01:25:21.717 --> 01:25:24.885
¶ God blessed me with that open
road ¶

01:25:24.887 --> 01:25:28.388
¶ Going where the hell I wanna
go ¶

01:25:28.390 --> 01:25:31.758
¶ Not a soul all the
things that I feel free ¶
