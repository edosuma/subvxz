00:44.628 --> 00:46.171
Those days were amazing.

00:46.380 --> 00:50.926
Being a kid, you know, what else was I
to do but to live the Dragon?

00:51.134 --> 00:54.805
I'd study the music note for note.
I read every interview.

00:55.013 --> 00:59.017
Copied every outfit, every move,
you know, every look.

00:59.768 --> 01:02.521
<i>My pursuit of perfection</i>
<i>was relentless.</i>

01:04.647 --> 01:06.525
<i>The music deserved that.</i>

01:06.733 --> 01:09.111
<i>All right, ladies. Spread them.</i>

01:35.262 --> 01:38.056
Rob, you're not nailing the squeal.

01:38.307 --> 01:40.893
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:42.436 --> 01:43.395
Check it out.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.365
Play it like that.

01:57.492 --> 02:00.078
That's it.
That's a ping, not a squeal.

02:00.704 --> 02:04.082
- Sounds just like the tape, man.
- No. Raunchier.

02:05.292 --> 02:07.085
Again, please.

02:09.128 --> 02:10.756
That was great. Thank you.

02:11.757 --> 02:12.758
From the top.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.009
Hold on!

03:18.699 --> 03:20.492
Hey, Jeremy, no.

03:20.784 --> 03:23.704
What are you doing?
You know what this is?

03:23.871 --> 03:28.834
<i>Lubricator,</i> signed by all five
band members with the original cover.

03:29.168 --> 03:32.546
Look. Jorgen's name is misspelled.
It should be an "E."

03:32.713 --> 03:35.007
You know how much I can get for it?

03:36.216 --> 03:39.094
Peace to you too, dude.
Try it like this.

03:48.729 --> 03:52.107
Mom?
Mom, isn't my room off-limits?

03:52.316 --> 03:56.445
I'm sorry, Chris.
Oh, what were you doing?

03:58.238 --> 04:00.574
- How are you?
- Good. How's Willard?

04:00.741 --> 04:03.035
- He's fine. You look nice.
- Thank you.

04:03.243 --> 04:06.079
Here, hold on.
You got a smudge.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.999
- Bye. Gotta run.
- Bye. Love you.

04:09.208 --> 04:11.460
Love you too. Bye.

04:28.852 --> 04:32.397
I need more power! I want more!

05:45.053 --> 05:46.847
Come on, come on.

05:51.602 --> 05:52.895
Nina and Samantha!

05:54.438 --> 05:56.148
Hey, Chris.

05:58.275 --> 06:01.361
- Coming to my show in a week?
- Of course.

06:01.570 --> 06:03.739
- Want to hand out fliers?
- Absolutely.

06:03.947 --> 06:06.116
- You guys look awesome.
- Bye.

06:06.325 --> 06:08.535
We're a band called Blood Pollution...

06:08.744 --> 06:12.289
a Steel Dragon tribute band,
the best in Pittsburgh.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.315
Thank you.

06:40.067 --> 06:43.320
I wrote this one for someone
who ripped out my heart.

06:43.529 --> 06:45.822
And put it through a bloody blender!

06:46.156 --> 06:47.449
That's right.

06:51.328 --> 06:55.958
This one's for Kim, who makes me
want to stand up and shout.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.777
Em, I'll be right back, okay?

08:07.362 --> 08:08.572
Excuse me.

08:15.787 --> 08:18.123
You think I could have one?

08:19.249 --> 08:23.587
Not without a blowjob and a sex
change, pal. But have a nice day.

08:24.505 --> 08:27.758
- Come on, girls. This way.
- See you, Chris.

08:44.942 --> 08:47.152
Oh, that was awesome!

08:47.361 --> 08:50.322
That was the heaviest
since Columbus in '77.

08:50.531 --> 08:53.367
Heavier than the <i>Demented</i> tour.

08:54.910 --> 08:58.622
- I ask you, did they not rock?
- They totally rocked.

09:08.799 --> 09:09.967
Guys.

09:13.345 --> 09:14.805
What the...?

09:22.729 --> 09:24.106
Come on.

09:24.940 --> 09:27.526
Oh, I thought I smelled pussy.

09:28.277 --> 09:29.361
Look who's here.

09:29.736 --> 09:34.157
- If it isn't Yoko Ono and the Fag Five.
- What are you doing?

09:34.408 --> 09:37.536
Making sure nobody sees
some cut-rate copy band.

09:37.744 --> 09:41.039
Cut-rate? This dude can't
even tune his own guitar.

09:41.248 --> 09:44.877
- You could work on your lip-synch.
- I don't lip-synch.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.880
Be doing everyone a favor if you did.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.007
You could get the outfit right.

09:50.215 --> 09:54.136
Boots from the <i>Wasted</i> tour
and a cheap <i>Twisted</i> jacket.

09:54.344 --> 09:59.016
You are so fully wrong, cocksmoker.
This is official issue.

09:59.266 --> 10:02.519
The actual vest Bobby wore
on the <i>Twisted</i> tour.

10:02.728 --> 10:05.480
My dad bought it from someone
who knows them.

10:05.689 --> 10:08.525
Sorry, but your dad got ripped.

10:08.859 --> 10:13.280
The lapels should be blue,
there's no green in the embroidery.

10:13.447 --> 10:16.742
As a matter of fact,
can anybody here honestly say...

10:16.950 --> 10:21.205
they've ever seen Bobby Beers
with a jacket with red lapels?

10:21.413 --> 10:23.373
- No, I can't.
- I don't think so.

10:23.582 --> 10:25.417
You can make me his pants.

10:25.626 --> 10:28.086
Or did she already rip out
the Dodge seats?

10:28.295 --> 10:33.050
No. First tell me what you put there
to make people think you're a guy.

10:33.383 --> 10:36.803
- This is all me, baby.
- You and a few ballet slippers.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.097
- You want a piece of me?
- No, I'm good.

10:39.306 --> 10:42.434
- Want to see how a real man...
- Don't touch her.

10:45.354 --> 10:48.899
- Let go of my cape.
- Let go of my cape!

11:20.389 --> 11:22.266
Get your ass out of bed.

11:25.894 --> 11:27.145
Get out of here.

11:28.814 --> 11:31.650
- Let's go. Get up.
- Get out of here.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.151
Move it.

11:36.738 --> 11:39.366
Where you hiding
your stash these days?

11:39.575 --> 11:41.577
Get out! I didn't do anything.

11:41.785 --> 11:44.663
That's the problem.
You never do anything.

11:44.872 --> 11:48.417
- Get out of here, pig!
- God... Fucking...

11:49.960 --> 11:51.378
Come on!

11:51.545 --> 11:54.214
Mom! Mom!

11:57.718 --> 12:03.182
Jeez, boys. Quit. Break it up.
Chris, give him a break. Come on.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.475
- Stop it!
- Tell him to get out!

12:05.684 --> 12:07.477
- Used to be my room.
- Not anymore!

12:07.686 --> 12:10.022
Because I moved out when I was 18.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.649
- We're having breakfast.
- Keep him out!

12:12.858 --> 12:16.195
Get ready for work.
Will you go downstairs?

12:16.403 --> 12:19.198
- Keep him out!
- All right, he's gone.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.996
So you arrested Mervin
for drunk driving?

12:26.205 --> 12:28.415
He was parked on
the Brennemans' lawn.

12:28.624 --> 12:32.085
Claims he was going out for ice cream.
Same story.

12:33.253 --> 12:36.423
- Chris, so how was the show?
- It was fine.

12:36.632 --> 12:40.511
- The freaks were out in force.
- Why weren't you busting heads?

12:40.719 --> 12:43.847
- Female officers handle that crowd.
- You want to go?

12:44.056 --> 12:47.351
- Come on.
- Saved again. Should take her to work.

12:47.559 --> 12:49.728
- Good one.
- Did they do "Black Babylon"?

12:49.937 --> 12:53.106
They haven't played that
since Osaka in '75.

12:53.315 --> 12:56.568
- That is pathetic that you know.
- I love that song.

12:56.777 --> 13:00.197
Okay, genius,
who's buried in Grant's tomb?

13:00.405 --> 13:05.118
It's twisted that you're still living
at home, stealing Ma's makeup.

13:05.327 --> 13:06.954
Who's buried in Grant's tomb?

13:07.162 --> 13:09.790
How much longer will you
put up with this?

13:09.998 --> 13:14.127
The rock star fantasy thing is
something you grow out of at 14.

13:14.336 --> 13:19.424
If I get lucky, I'll get to grow up
and listen to Air Supply like you.

13:19.633 --> 13:21.969
What's wrong with Air Supply?

13:22.177 --> 13:24.763
Nothing, if you're
from the Village People.

13:24.972 --> 13:26.932
You know what the sickest thing
is about you?

13:27.307 --> 13:30.894
It's that you don't have
any fantasies of your own.

13:31.103 --> 13:33.605
You fantasize about
being somebody else.

13:34.147 --> 13:38.235
Wearing somebody else's clothes.
Singing somebody else's songs.

13:38.443 --> 13:40.237
It's pathetic.

13:41.655 --> 13:45.534
- Get a haircut.
- Okay, Satan's allegiant.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.160
Have a good one, son.

13:47.327 --> 13:50.289
- You didn't eat.
- Later. I love you guys.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.623
Love you too.

13:51.832 --> 13:54.334
- I love you.
- You do this every time.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.795
I question his sexuality, Ma. I do.

14:02.509 --> 14:06.930
Here's the procedure, so it won't
happen again. Don't stick a pen in.

14:07.139 --> 14:10.100
I'll give you a simple
one-two-three procedure.

14:10.309 --> 14:14.229
It's 1-2-3.
Pop that down, push this.

14:14.438 --> 14:18.734
Pull back on this lever, free up
the jam and you can access...

14:21.195 --> 14:23.155
Is there something wrong?

14:23.655 --> 14:25.490
Is that mascara?

14:25.699 --> 14:29.203
- I'm in a band. Okay?
- Oh, okay.

14:29.411 --> 14:32.873
Can you follow the 1-2-3
without sticking a pen in there?

14:33.665 --> 14:34.666
Thank you.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.293
Thank you very much.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.545
Bye-bye.

15:16.333 --> 15:17.918
Sorry about that.

15:26.218 --> 15:28.345
When's Marci getting back?

15:28.554 --> 15:32.391
She and Rob went to see Wham!
Won't be back for a while.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.269
Wham!? Oh, God.

15:35.477 --> 15:39.565
George Michael's a wuss.
I'm gonna give Rob shit for it.

15:40.357 --> 15:42.192
He'll want to cover that.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.444
All right, you.

15:45.070 --> 15:48.240
Okay, now just relax.

15:53.620 --> 15:56.665
- Is it numb?
- I think so.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.625
Feel that?

16:11.305 --> 16:15.642
- Sure you want to do this?
- Yeah, Bobby did it last week.

16:23.525 --> 16:26.528
- I love you, babe.
- I love you.

16:33.368 --> 16:36.663
Okay, don't look. Don't look.

16:46.673 --> 16:50.928
- God, that had to hurt.
- Yes, it does. Oh, God.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.737
You want to do the other one?

17:08.945 --> 17:12.366
No. You want to do yours?

17:12.532 --> 17:15.911
- Maybe.
- Come on. Let's do yours.

17:22.709 --> 17:26.128
Testing, testing. One, two.

17:33.387 --> 17:36.056
- No way!
- That's right. That's my boy.

17:36.265 --> 17:38.892
All right, ladies,
who had the weenies?

17:50.237 --> 17:52.531
Do I have too much foundation on?

17:52.739 --> 17:56.785
I keep putting this shit on
till I want to fuck myself.

17:57.744 --> 18:01.206
- Hey, Rob, you wearing underwear?
- No.

18:01.790 --> 18:03.333
Rob.

18:03.834 --> 18:06.170
You know the drill. No panties.

18:07.421 --> 18:09.715
- Get up.
- I am not freezing my balls...

18:09.923 --> 18:11.758
Just stand up and drop it.

18:11.967 --> 18:14.178
- I'm not taking it off.
- Come on.

18:14.469 --> 18:18.056
If you want, take them off.
I am not taking off...

18:20.767 --> 18:23.270
Your woman's an animal!

18:29.318 --> 18:30.944
All right!

18:32.362 --> 18:34.406
Before we get too into this party.

18:34.573 --> 18:36.241
- I love you!
- Love you too.

18:36.450 --> 18:41.038
Before we get too deep into this party,
I want to thank Key Steel...

18:41.246 --> 18:45.417
for letting us use their place
of business to pay tribute...

18:45.792 --> 18:50.380
to the metal created by
none other than Steel Dragon!

18:52.132 --> 18:55.093
And a special thanks
to my brother, Joe...

18:55.344 --> 18:59.264
who gave me my first Dragon
record because he hated it.

19:01.850 --> 19:06.188
And to my parents, because they
let me play it as loud as I wanted!

19:07.064 --> 19:09.816
- That's my boy!
- That's my baby!

19:10.025 --> 19:11.985
Because they rock!

19:16.657 --> 19:19.284
Now, this next tune...

19:20.160 --> 19:24.289
I’d like to dedicate to someone
who, when I first met...

19:24.498 --> 19:28.794
ripped my heart out
and put it through a bloody blender.

19:29.002 --> 19:33.048
That's right! This one's for Emily!

19:33.340 --> 19:37.469
She turns me up and shakes me
down and makes me want to what?

19:37.678 --> 19:39.471
Stand up and shout!

21:14.066 --> 21:15.192
What was that?

21:16.443 --> 21:17.861
What was what?

21:18.445 --> 21:21.156
There's no solo break
after the chorus.

21:21.365 --> 21:23.367
They don't care.

21:23.992 --> 21:26.119
That's not how the song goes.

21:26.787 --> 21:28.747
I know how the song goes.

21:28.956 --> 21:31.875
If you know how it goes,
then play it right.

21:32.084 --> 21:36.255
Chris, you are taking this shit
too seriously.

21:36.463 --> 21:40.759
That's right, because the music
deserves to be taken seriously.

21:40.968 --> 21:44.304
If you don't,
you don't deserve to play it.

21:44.680 --> 21:47.307
All right, you need to get a grip.

21:47.641 --> 21:51.478
You've ruined your performance.
Do not ruin mine!

22:19.339 --> 22:20.299
Hey!

22:23.594 --> 22:26.388
Plug that fucker back in.

22:53.707 --> 22:55.209
Quit it!

22:56.126 --> 23:00.547
- That's my amp!
- Do not ruin this concert! Do not!

23:00.714 --> 23:02.799
Hey, fuck this concert!

23:08.555 --> 23:09.765
Here we go again.

23:17.898 --> 23:22.319
- Hit him in the bollocks.
- That wraps it up for tonight.

23:22.569 --> 23:26.990
Grab a T-shirt and cassette on
your way out. Thanks for coming.

24:31.305 --> 24:32.681
Cut it.

24:35.809 --> 24:38.937
- What's up?
- What's he doing here?

24:39.229 --> 24:42.608
- What are you doing here?
- Bradley's our new front man.

24:45.903 --> 24:49.656
You made your point.
Get him out now.

24:49.865 --> 24:53.202
- Only one leaving is you.
- Chris, see these?

24:53.410 --> 24:58.081
It's the new P.A. He brought with him.
And that's the new mixing board.

24:58.707 --> 25:00.584
Have you heard his voice?

25:00.792 --> 25:04.213
- Sit and spin.
- Dude, just relax.

25:05.172 --> 25:09.259
I don't care if Bradley can hit
the notes Bobby Beers can hit.

25:09.468 --> 25:11.428
Bobby's leaving the band anyway.

25:11.762 --> 25:15.057
- You don't know.
- Nina and Samantha say he's leaving.

25:15.516 --> 25:18.060
- Bullshit.
- It doesn't matter.

25:18.268 --> 25:22.940
We want people to hear our originals.
We're tired of being a cover band.

25:23.148 --> 25:27.528
- We're a tribute band.
- No, dude. We are a cover band.

25:27.694 --> 25:30.989
The problem is, you think
you're in Steel Dragon.

25:31.198 --> 25:33.659
I love you, man, but you're mental.

25:33.867 --> 25:38.789
Get a grip on reality. You don't know
where Bobby Beers ends and you begin.

25:40.082 --> 25:44.336
I'm mental, because I don't want
to be in a cheesy bar band...

25:44.545 --> 25:49.216
that butchers music and makes them
listen to your crappy originals!

25:49.424 --> 25:54.638
Crappy? "Whole and a Half" kicks ass.
I'm proud to have written it.

25:54.847 --> 25:57.432
That's why we got
so many requests for it.

25:57.641 --> 26:02.020
Don't shit on me because you're
scared to write your own songs.

26:03.313 --> 26:06.692
Yeah, that's it. I'm too scared.

26:06.900 --> 26:09.778
If you wanna make it,
you write your own tunes.

26:10.237 --> 26:13.740
Thanks for the tip, bro.
Look, come on, guys.

26:14.366 --> 26:19.079
We loved playing Dragon tunes. We
couldn't imagine playing anything else.

26:19.288 --> 26:22.040
- I thought it'd be a goof.
- A goof?

26:22.249 --> 26:25.002
Wouldn't you rather fail
as yourself...

26:25.210 --> 26:27.546
than succeed as
a Bobby Beers clone?

26:27.754 --> 26:31.425
You can write a song about
why I would wanna do that!

26:31.633 --> 26:34.553
All right, you're gone. Just go!

26:34.803 --> 26:37.139
What's so fucking funny?

26:37.931 --> 26:39.725
Babe, come on. Let's go.

26:40.267 --> 26:44.730
Fine. This is my mike stand!
I'm taking it! These are my cables.

26:45.439 --> 26:47.232
I'll get new cables.

26:48.275 --> 26:50.736
- Don't think I'm coming back.
- I don't.

26:51.653 --> 26:54.239
- Well, that's because I'm not.
- Good.

26:55.949 --> 26:58.744
I'm serious. If I leave,
I'm not coming back!

26:58.952 --> 27:01.288
- You said that!
- Shut up, Bradley.

27:02.080 --> 27:03.707
Last time.

27:10.881 --> 27:12.090
Emily.

27:19.097 --> 27:23.769
If you still want to manage us,
then it's okay with us.

27:24.686 --> 27:27.606
Rob, I'm a businesswoman.

27:27.814 --> 27:31.443
Rule one in this business is
you go where the talent is...

27:31.652 --> 27:36.073
and all the fucking talent
that was in this band just left.

28:10.190 --> 28:13.235
You know, those guys are
so replaceable.

28:13.694 --> 28:18.740
It'll take me five minutes to put
together a band and blow them away.

28:22.703 --> 28:25.330
Maybe this is just a sign.

28:26.123 --> 28:29.418
You know, just time to move on.

28:31.211 --> 28:34.506
I'm not in the mood to look
on the bright side now.

28:34.715 --> 28:38.510
No, this is an opportunity for you...

28:38.719 --> 28:40.637
to write your own songs.

28:40.846 --> 28:41.889
Why?

28:42.097 --> 28:46.852
Be another clown with a guitar,
trying to get attention? No way.

28:47.519 --> 28:50.480
Remember what you wrote
for me on my birthday?

28:50.689 --> 28:53.358
- No.
- Yes, you do.

28:59.364 --> 29:02.117
Come on, please.
It's embarrassing.

29:06.330 --> 29:09.208
Are you done making fun of me yet?

29:12.961 --> 29:14.671
I love that song.

29:17.257 --> 29:20.511
You're not getting it.
You're not hearing me.

29:21.261 --> 29:24.097
I'm telling you,
first time I ever saw you...

29:24.515 --> 29:27.059
first time I laid eyes on you...

29:27.267 --> 29:31.563
sophomore year, Bill Starbuck
in <i>The Rainmaker.</i>

29:32.689 --> 29:36.568
I said to myself,
"Oh, my God, that guy's got it."

29:36.777 --> 29:38.403
I mean, my heart stopped.

29:42.115 --> 29:46.411
And I said,
"That guy is going all the way."

29:52.960 --> 29:56.171
I was just singing
someone else's lines.

29:57.256 --> 29:59.550
I did not write them.

30:14.982 --> 30:18.694
- My favorite color is rainbow.
<i>- Mine's mauve.</i>

30:18.902 --> 30:23.031
I said no. Haley, did you answer
the telephone? Thank you.

30:23.365 --> 30:25.325
Sunshine Daycare.

30:25.659 --> 30:28.662
Chris! Telephone!

30:31.373 --> 30:34.209
Telephone!
You want to help me crack eggs?

30:34.418 --> 30:36.378
- I want five.
- Five eggs.

30:46.763 --> 30:50.142
<i>Chris? Is that Chris Cole?</i>

30:50.350 --> 30:53.312
- Who is this?
<i>- This is Kirk Cuddy.</i>

31:08.035 --> 31:10.996
Ricki, your accent is
as lame as your playing.

31:11.663 --> 31:14.917
What do you suggest
I do about my playing?

31:15.125 --> 31:16.126
Who is this?

31:16.335 --> 31:20.422
I told you, it's Kirk Cuddy.
I play in a band called Steel Dragon.

31:20.672 --> 31:23.592
<i>- Maybe you've heard of us.</i>
- I don't have time.

31:23.800 --> 31:27.346
Hang on, hang on.
Listen to this, all right?

31:35.896 --> 31:37.606
Are you lip-synching?

31:38.190 --> 31:41.527
If this is Kirk,
what did you call your third wife?

31:41.735 --> 31:46.114
Do we have to talk about that old slag?
I called her Sugar Bum.

31:46.323 --> 31:49.868
<i>The second wife, too.</i>
<i>It's why the third left.</i>

31:50.077 --> 31:53.497
<i>Now I affectionately refer</i>
<i>to all ladies as Tottie.</i>

31:53.705 --> 31:55.958
<i>Is that enough for you?</i>

31:56.166 --> 32:00.462
My God, this is unbelievable.
I was sorry to hear about your dog.

32:00.671 --> 32:01.672
<i>Pookie?</i>

32:01.880 --> 32:05.259
Yeah. I sent flowers
but I didn't get a response.

32:05.467 --> 32:07.511
But I figured you're so busy.

32:07.719 --> 32:10.681
Can we get past
the <i>This Is Your Life</i> crap?

32:10.889 --> 32:15.185
There's a ticket waiting for you
for a flight to L.A. Tomorrow.

32:15.477 --> 32:18.564
- Are you serious?
<i>- Of course I'm serious.</i>

32:18.772 --> 32:21.108
<i>- Tell no one about this.</i>
- Yes, sir.

32:21.316 --> 32:23.902
<i>Good man. I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

32:24.111 --> 32:25.237
Bye.

32:54.892 --> 32:56.393
Right there.

32:57.644 --> 32:58.979
I'm Chris Cole.

32:59.188 --> 33:01.565
I'm Tania. I work with the band.

33:01.773 --> 33:04.943
- You went out with Bobby.
- You look like Bobby.

33:05.444 --> 33:08.113
- Is that all you brought?
- My manager.

33:08.906 --> 33:12.034
We traded the first-class ticket
for two coach.

33:12.242 --> 33:13.619
How resourceful.

33:13.827 --> 33:15.913
Yeah, well, I thought so.

33:16.121 --> 33:18.707
What was that? Did you see that?

33:25.672 --> 33:26.798
Why are we here?

33:27.299 --> 33:30.969
I should let Kirk explain
everything to you.

33:32.846 --> 33:34.973
Are those your breasts?

33:36.016 --> 33:37.768
I'm sorry. What?

33:38.185 --> 33:41.897
Your breasts. Are they yours?

33:45.108 --> 33:48.278
Well, you know, I don't remember.

33:49.112 --> 33:51.949
They're quite sensational.

33:52.157 --> 33:55.536
Well, thanks.
That's just what I was going for.

33:55.744 --> 33:58.205
So you're in a Steel Dragon cover band.

33:58.413 --> 34:00.123
- Tribute band.
- Right.

34:00.332 --> 34:04.253
I'm kind of sort of
in between bands right now.

34:06.213 --> 34:09.967
- Your pants.
- Emily had them made for me.

34:10.175 --> 34:12.678
I bet they're easy
to get in and out of.

34:16.264 --> 34:19.685
So, when do we get there?
Tania, is it?

34:19.893 --> 34:20.853
Tania.

34:41.373 --> 34:44.333
- Are you famous?
- No, we're nobody. Sorry.

34:44.543 --> 34:48.130
- Well, you should be!
- Oh, thank you. Bye.

34:48.338 --> 34:53.051
- Can you get us in?
- I'm just trying to get in myself.

35:18.452 --> 35:20.746
Follow me, darlings.

35:37.095 --> 35:40.349
This is Bobby's <i>Twisted</i> tour in '77.

35:40.599 --> 35:43.143
- Look at that.
- See the dragon?

35:52.402 --> 35:53.612
That's Sammy!

36:16.301 --> 36:17.469
Look!

36:22.516 --> 36:26.103
It's a '58 Flying V
in fire-mist gold.

36:26.311 --> 36:30.858
And it's the real one. Look.
The fingerboards are rosewood.

36:31.066 --> 36:33.527
That's from the
<i>Delirious</i> tour, right?

36:33.694 --> 36:37.114
- Are you two coming or what?
- Yeah. Sorry.

36:58.135 --> 37:00.512
Wait right here, all right?

37:03.557 --> 37:06.268
Thanks a lot, Ralph. That's great.

37:06.476 --> 37:09.479
- That's it?
- Yeah. Very nice. Thanks.

37:10.147 --> 37:11.148
Lovely.

37:16.904 --> 37:19.239
They're ready for you now.

37:30.292 --> 37:31.418
What's up?

37:31.627 --> 37:34.671
Thanks for coming.
Not too fagged out?

37:35.130 --> 37:37.841
- I don't think so.
- Mats, the road manager.

37:38.050 --> 37:42.179
I saw you in Pittsburgh.
You gave everybody a pass but me.

37:42.387 --> 37:45.349
From the looks of you,
I had good reason.

37:46.558 --> 37:50.896
We saw a tape of you singing
provided by Nina and Samantha.

37:52.022 --> 37:54.733
Is the incredible voice really yours?

37:54.942 --> 37:57.736
- Cocksuckers!
- That would be you, Bobby.

37:57.945 --> 38:00.864
You think some child
can replace me?

38:01.073 --> 38:02.741
You want to do your thing.

38:02.950 --> 38:04.660
- You're firing me?
- Calm down.

38:04.868 --> 38:07.204
You calm down, you wanker!

38:07.663 --> 38:10.707
- It's because I'm gay, isn't it?
- You're gay?

38:12.251 --> 38:17.297
No, I have pierced nipples and a house
in Morocco because I'm John Wayne.

38:18.674 --> 38:22.094
Have you listened
to the lyrics of "Stand Up"?

38:22.302 --> 38:25.389
Did you really think
that Kim was a girl?

38:25.722 --> 38:28.141
- Kim was a guy?
- Yeah, Kim was a guy.

38:28.350 --> 38:31.770
He's my lover, to the horror
of these sausage-jockeys.

38:31.979 --> 38:36.775
- As if we give a toss.
- Just keep your dick away from me.

38:36.984 --> 38:38.235
Stop it, man.

38:38.443 --> 38:41.697
You don't turn up
for recording sessions.

38:41.905 --> 38:45.075
You missed half the gigs,
and when you did show...

38:45.284 --> 38:49.079
I am Steel Dragon!
Without me, you're nothing!

38:49.288 --> 38:50.247
Give us a break.

38:50.497 --> 38:53.667
You'll be playing for coppers
in the tube without me!

38:54.084 --> 38:55.252
We'll see.

38:55.919 --> 38:58.213
Yeah. We'll see.

39:04.178 --> 39:06.180
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

39:20.444 --> 39:21.612
My scarf.

39:23.113 --> 39:25.324
- Take it.
- Yeah, I will.

39:25.991 --> 39:26.950
Good.

39:27.910 --> 39:31.955
If I leave now, I'm never coming back.
Never.

39:32.456 --> 39:34.249
Heard you the first time.

39:35.751 --> 39:37.085
What you looking at?

39:38.045 --> 39:40.756
You think you can dress like me
and be a star?

39:40.964 --> 39:45.093
- No, sir.
- You have no idea what it takes.

39:45.636 --> 39:48.514
You think it's all sex,
drugs and rock 'n' roll?

39:48.722 --> 39:50.015
You got the sex wrong.

39:50.224 --> 39:54.311
I never touch drugs.
No one does a gig like I do half-cut.

39:54.520 --> 39:55.979
Not even at your age.

39:56.188 --> 40:00.776
And it's bed, 11:30 every night
before a gig. That's what it takes.

40:01.193 --> 40:02.945
Just do your own thing.

40:03.153 --> 40:07.366
Get your own life.
It's like being bloody Elvis.

40:07.574 --> 40:09.618
Except Elvis was the king.

40:17.084 --> 40:19.002
And I'm just the queen.

40:22.339 --> 40:23.882
Very funny.

40:24.758 --> 40:26.510
Ha-bloody-ha.

40:27.761 --> 40:30.806
Bastards. You bastards.

41:01.545 --> 41:03.547
Sorry about that.

41:06.300 --> 41:09.219
- Missed your cue.
- Yeah, sorry, IK...

41:09.553 --> 41:11.930
- You do know this song?
- Yes, sir.

41:12.139 --> 41:15.726
We'll pick it up just
coming out of the intro.

41:30.532 --> 41:31.783
I'm sorry.

41:33.493 --> 41:35.120
We wasting our time here?

41:35.329 --> 41:38.415
Sorry. Could I start it one more time?

41:38.957 --> 41:40.459
All right, go again.

41:40.709 --> 41:42.628
Sorry about that.

41:47.174 --> 41:48.300
<i>I love you.</i>

41:49.468 --> 41:50.761
<i>I love you.</i>

43:32.070 --> 43:36.575
Well, mate, do you want the gig, then?

43:39.494 --> 43:42.915
Look in the lens, guys.
Go. Get in there more.

43:43.123 --> 43:46.043
Give me attitude.
Two double-platinum records.

43:46.251 --> 43:50.339
You're playing the Forum. You got
20 girls who want to be with you.

43:50.547 --> 43:54.259
Give me rock star attitude.
Hold that. Here we go.

43:54.468 --> 43:57.846
Hey, Izzy, let's try one
with attitude. No smile.

43:58.055 --> 43:59.056
Sorry.

43:59.264 --> 44:01.475
Better. Now you're looking cool.

44:01.683 --> 44:04.978
Come on, right in my lens.
Nice shot. Attitude.

44:05.395 --> 44:09.191
We combed this entire planet
looking for someone...

44:09.399 --> 44:13.278
heavy enough to pull this off
and we found a star.

44:13.487 --> 44:18.617
When this guy sings, you'll forget
about Bobby Beers. I promise you.

44:19.159 --> 44:21.411
Izzy! Is that your name? Izzy?

44:21.620 --> 44:24.540
Yeah, the name's Izzy,
like Izzy's Revenge.

44:24.998 --> 44:26.625
Holy shit.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.962
Izzy? I'm not calling him Izzy.

44:30.170 --> 44:32.256
Can you hit all the notes
Bobby can?

44:32.756 --> 44:34.758
That's why I'm in the band.

44:34.967 --> 44:36.885
<i>Stand up and shout</i>

44:55.863 --> 44:59.157
How do you keep your voice
in such great shape?

44:59.366 --> 45:02.578
My choir teacher gives me
really cool exercises...

45:02.786 --> 45:05.289
He eats a lot of pussy, that's how.

45:05.914 --> 45:08.083
<i>Yeah, I eat a lot of pussy.</i>

45:08.750 --> 45:11.128
- Classy.
- Like father, like son.

45:11.336 --> 45:13.672
- That's my boy.
- Come on, you guys.

45:15.257 --> 45:17.467
- How was I?
- So good. So comfortable.

45:17.676 --> 45:19.803
- I messed up my accent.
- It was great.

45:20.012 --> 45:24.558
- Nice way to handle that "pussy" line.
- I can't argue with him.

45:24.766 --> 45:28.353
Izzy, don't worry.
I'll make an honest man out of you.

45:32.316 --> 45:34.484
I eat a lot of pussy.

45:34.902 --> 45:36.570
Loads of it.

45:39.239 --> 45:41.200
I eat a lot of pussy.

45:42.409 --> 45:43.785
Tons.

45:44.244 --> 45:49.208
I got my voice eating pussy, man.
It's a vocal technique exercise.

45:50.751 --> 45:54.505
I got it eating pussy.
Loads of it. All the time.

45:54.713 --> 45:59.051
It's all I do. Breakfast, morning,
noon, night. I've got to have it.

46:00.302 --> 46:03.055
It's all I do, is eat pussy.
I love it.

46:03.263 --> 46:06.016
Either get in here and do it
or shut up.

46:06.558 --> 46:09.895
Hold on. Oh, shit! I eat pussy!

47:03.866 --> 47:06.076
Hi. I'm Izzy's mother.

47:16.003 --> 47:18.797
- Have a good one.
- I'll see you up there.

47:20.716 --> 47:24.469
- Did you see all the people?
- I know. Just breathe.

47:24.678 --> 47:27.681
You'll be great.
Nobody knows these songs better.

47:28.056 --> 47:29.850
- True.
- Be yourself, Chris.

47:30.058 --> 47:31.310
- Don't get...
- Izzy.

47:33.020 --> 47:36.815
You'll be great, babe.
I love you so much.

47:37.024 --> 47:38.692
I love you too.

47:38.942 --> 47:41.445
All right, matey.
Time to go to work.

47:41.653 --> 47:44.239
Sorry, darling, back to the henhouse.

47:46.033 --> 47:48.493
I'm gonna sit with his parents.

47:48.869 --> 47:52.789
Whatever twirls your beanie.
Come on, mate.

47:53.207 --> 47:55.501
- I gotta piss.
- What? You gotta piss?

47:55.709 --> 47:57.002
- Go now.
- I can't.

47:57.211 --> 48:01.590
Or you gotta use it. Use it.
You're awesome. Bye, babe.

48:04.134 --> 48:06.637
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

48:07.054 --> 48:11.850
Well, you're in my house now, mate.
And I ain't lost a man yet.

48:12.059 --> 48:13.727
- Let's do it.
- Here we go.

48:13.936 --> 48:15.938
Let's do it, Mats.

48:17.314 --> 48:20.817
This is your coronation, my dear.

48:23.654 --> 48:25.280
There you go.

48:25.989 --> 48:27.199
All right, boy.

48:27.908 --> 48:29.409
You're okay.

48:29.618 --> 48:33.789
You won't need it, but there's
a bucket in each wing, all right?

48:34.164 --> 48:37.459
- Up you go.
- All right, Mats.

48:46.051 --> 48:47.302
Break a leg!

50:37.371 --> 50:39.623
Are you all right, Izzy?
