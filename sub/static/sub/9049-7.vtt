00:02.305 --> 00:05.941
The purpose of life skills class
is to prepare you for the future.

00:05.943 --> 00:08.210
Though, honestly,

00:08.212 --> 00:11.380
nothing can prepare you for when your
deadbeat boyfriend crashes your car

00:11.382 --> 00:13.682
and leaves you for your
pilates instructor.

00:16.552 --> 00:19.187
Anyway, for this
week's assignment,

00:19.189 --> 00:21.957
everyone will pair up and put together
a budget and a visual presentation

00:21.959 --> 00:23.959
for one of these
major life events.

00:23.961 --> 00:27.696
"Retirement. Baby shower."

00:27.698 --> 00:30.499
Ooh! A wedding. Let's
plan a wedding.

00:32.634 --> 00:34.636
Ally...

00:34.638 --> 00:36.872
Will you make me the happiest
man in life skills class

00:36.874 --> 00:37.741
and fake-marry me?

00:37.772 --> 00:41.209
And promise to honor and cherish
me until the bell do us part?

00:41.211 --> 00:42.978
I do.

00:42.980 --> 00:45.547
Let's make a budget for the
best fake wedding ever.

00:45.549 --> 00:50.419
You two make such a cute couple,
just like Philip and I used to be.

00:50.421 --> 00:52.220
He stole my heart...

00:52.222 --> 00:54.256
Then he stole my waffle maker.

00:55.992 --> 00:58.860
I know how you feel. I
was a cute couple once.

00:58.862 --> 01:00.062
Her name was Carrie.

01:00.064 --> 01:01.930
Probably still is.

01:03.299 --> 01:05.266
I'm sorry. Are you supposed
to be in this class?

01:05.269 --> 01:06.768
Nope.

01:08.337 --> 01:10.572
Congratulations on the
fake engagement, buddy.

01:10.574 --> 01:14.509
If you break his heart, I
swear I will destroy you.

01:15.445 --> 01:16.845
Toodles!

01:18.000 --> 01:24.074

02:12.935 --> 02:16.505
Okay, fake fiance, ready
to plan our fake wedding?

02:16.507 --> 02:18.540
Yeah, Ms. townsend
gave us a budget.

02:18.542 --> 02:20.475
We just have to figure how much
pretend money we can spend

02:20.477 --> 02:22.978
on stuff like flowers,
food, and a bounce house.

02:22.980 --> 02:26.014
We're not having a bounce
house at our wedding.

02:26.949 --> 02:29.851
- It's not a real wedding.
- Yeah, but that's real tacky.

02:31.420 --> 02:32.921
Hey, you know what we should do?

02:33.990 --> 02:35.390
A petting zoo.

02:35.392 --> 02:38.593
No, for our presentation.

02:38.595 --> 02:40.929
Let's dress up like
a bride and groom.

02:40.931 --> 02:42.964
Great idea. I can be the groom.

02:44.767 --> 02:46.902
Yeah.

02:46.904 --> 02:48.970
And obviously, we'll
need flowers.

02:48.972 --> 02:52.941
I always pictured having a bouquet of
lilies and orchids at our wedding.

02:52.943 --> 02:54.409
Not that I've thought about it.

02:54.411 --> 02:57.078
I always pictured
having a big, awesome,

02:57.080 --> 02:59.447
six-layer white chocolate
cake at our wedding.

03:00.550 --> 03:02.584
Not that I thought
about it either.

03:02.586 --> 03:04.986
This is kinda weird, huh?

03:04.988 --> 03:06.922
Talking about our
future together.

03:07.857 --> 03:09.457
It's actually kinda fun.

03:09.459 --> 03:11.760
Carrie used to love things
that are actually kinda fun.

03:13.629 --> 03:16.031
Everything keeps
reminding me of her,

03:16.033 --> 03:18.567
especially these Aquasmile ads.

03:18.569 --> 03:20.068
Then why don't you
stop looking at them?

03:20.070 --> 03:22.671
I can't!

03:24.073 --> 03:25.740
Guys, big news.

03:25.742 --> 03:28.977
Guess who booked Dez a job
directing a commercial!

03:28.979 --> 03:30.512
Trish, you did that for me?

03:30.514 --> 03:32.948
You need something to get
your mind off of Carrie,

03:32.950 --> 03:35.116
plus, as your manager, I
get your entire paycheck.

03:35.118 --> 03:37.485
You're such a good friend.

03:38.521 --> 03:41.923
- So what's the commercial for?
- Armand Bianchi's new fragrance.

03:41.925 --> 03:43.592
Emu.

03:43.594 --> 03:47.462
- E-what now?
- It's a big bird.

03:47.464 --> 03:49.531
Anyway, Armand wants you
to start right away.

03:49.533 --> 03:50.832
Okay.

03:50.834 --> 03:52.567
Not this second!

03:52.569 --> 03:54.469
Do you even know
where you're going?

03:54.471 --> 03:55.417
No!

03:55.448 --> 03:59.140
All right, Ally, let's get
started on our presentation.

03:59.142 --> 04:02.077
Oh!

04:04.614 --> 04:06.514
Ooh. I just got a text.

04:06.516 --> 04:09.150
My label needs my new
single by this weekend.

04:09.152 --> 04:11.052
They want me at the
studio right away.

04:11.054 --> 04:14.055
That's cool. I can get
started without you.

04:14.057 --> 04:15.590
You're the best.

04:16.524 --> 04:18.059
Thanks, hubby-to-be.

04:22.064 --> 04:24.599
Trish, wanna hang out and
help me plan a wedding?

04:27.004 --> 04:28.903
Oh, sorry.

04:28.905 --> 04:31.539
I just got a text that says I
don't feel like doing that.

04:38.681 --> 04:41.516
Thanks for coming to the commercial
set to support me, Trish.

04:41.518 --> 04:43.652
Oh, I'm only here
for the pampering.

04:43.654 --> 04:46.588
These assistants will do anything
if they think you're important.

04:48.457 --> 04:50.558
Hi, I'm important.

04:50.560 --> 04:53.628
Is there anyone on set who
specializes in manicures?

04:57.066 --> 05:00.135
Ah!

05:00.137 --> 05:03.805
- Dezington!
- It's actually just "Dez."

05:03.807 --> 05:05.240
No, it's not.

05:05.242 --> 05:08.076
Shh! Listen. Do you hear that?

05:09.011 --> 05:09.805
- No.
- Exactly!

05:09.836 --> 05:12.981
If a tree falls in the woods but
no one is there to hear it,

05:12.983 --> 05:16.151
is lumberjack plaid
still in fashion?

05:17.086 --> 05:19.954
Ye-no-yes.

05:19.956 --> 05:24.893
I knew you'd understand.

05:24.895 --> 05:32.133
Now, let me show you the
new face of... Emu.

05:33.502 --> 05:34.969
Carrie!

05:36.138 --> 05:38.073
- Carrie?
- Carrie?

05:38.075 --> 05:39.808
I mean... wait.

05:39.810 --> 05:43.011
Carrie? Darn, I did it again.

05:43.013 --> 05:44.979
Dez?

05:47.284 --> 05:50.218
Just act normal.

05:50.220 --> 05:51.786
'Allo, Carrie.

05:51.788 --> 05:54.022
I look forward to working
with you in the morning.

05:54.024 --> 05:55.557
Pip pip! Cheerio.

06:02.031 --> 06:05.166
But if we go with chicken
instead of steak,

06:05.168 --> 06:07.068
we'll have money for the
silver napkin rings,

06:07.070 --> 06:10.672
which is perfect, because it'll
match the ribbon on Ally's dress.

06:10.674 --> 06:12.841
You know what I'm thinking?

06:12.843 --> 06:15.744
That the silver is a missed
opportunity to inject some color?

06:15.746 --> 06:19.948
Close. I'm thinking you should
share this junk with Ally,

06:19.950 --> 06:23.051
'cause I stopped listening after you
said, "hey, Trish, listen to this."

06:24.220 --> 06:26.654
I would, but Ally's
been recording all day.

06:26.656 --> 06:28.723
I had to call the
florist, the D.J.

06:28.725 --> 06:31.893
I even hand-wrote an
invitation in calligraphy.

06:33.095 --> 06:35.864
"Fish sticks bubble gum train"?

06:35.866 --> 06:38.032
That says "dear wedding guest."

06:38.034 --> 06:40.101
In what language?

06:40.103 --> 06:42.270
Well, check out
what else I made.

06:43.272 --> 06:46.808
It's a little Austin and Ally bride
and groom for the top of the cake.

06:46.810 --> 06:49.811
- I carved them out of soap.
- Well, good luck, groomzilla.

06:54.817 --> 06:57.085
Hey, Ally, are you almost here?

06:57.087 --> 06:59.888
I can't make it.

07:00.270 --> 07:02.991
Are you doing that thing where you
call and say you're somewhere else

07:02.993 --> 07:05.126
but you're really standing
outside the door?

07:05.128 --> 07:06.227
I love it when you do that.

07:06.229 --> 07:09.197
Austin, I'm stuck at the studio.

07:10.065 --> 07:12.801
Stuck at the studio
right outside the door?

07:13.736 --> 07:15.303
Hey, I... I gotta run.

07:15.305 --> 07:17.138
I really wish I was
there with you,

07:17.140 --> 07:21.109
but hey, at least we have our whole
future together, hubby-to-be.

07:26.282 --> 07:29.117
At least I get to hang
with you, soap Ally.

07:29.119 --> 07:32.020
You'd never get so busy where
you couldn't make time for me.

07:32.022 --> 07:35.690
Sorry, Austin, I have
music to record. Bye!

07:37.326 --> 07:40.728
Looks like it's just you
and me, soap Austin.

07:41.664 --> 07:44.132
Sorry. I've got to go
stand on top of a cake.

07:44.134 --> 07:45.266
Bye.

07:50.739 --> 07:52.874
I came back to get my phone.

07:53.809 --> 07:55.176
I'll just go get a new one.

08:05.605 --> 08:08.990
<i>We have our whole future
together, hubby-to-be.</i>

08:08.992 --> 08:13.294
<i>Our whole future.</i>

08:16.699 --> 08:19.767
Oh.

08:21.203 --> 08:25.073
Hey, Ally, I have everything set up for
our special dinner. Are you close?

08:25.075 --> 08:27.308
I can't make it.

08:27.310 --> 08:29.110
I'm stuck in Paris.

08:29.112 --> 08:32.280
I'm really sorry I'm not there for
our fifth wedding anniversary.

08:32.282 --> 08:35.149
Eh. You weren't here
for the other four...

08:35.150 --> 08:35.898
Or our wedding.

08:35.929 --> 08:38.785
You even missed the
birth of our octuplets.

08:43.192 --> 08:46.094
Mmm. My bad.

08:47.096 --> 08:49.330
Hey, I thought you
were in Paris.

08:49.332 --> 08:51.266
There are no pyramids in Paris.

08:51.268 --> 08:53.768
That's because this
is your dream.

08:54.703 --> 08:56.905
Look, now I have a mustache.

08:58.240 --> 08:59.874
What does it all mean?

08:59.876 --> 09:03.077
Obviously, this is all a
symbolic manifestation

09:03.079 --> 09:05.280
of your fear that in the future

09:05.282 --> 09:08.116
you'll be left behind while
I tour around the world.

09:08.118 --> 09:10.785
I don't know what
the mustache means.

09:10.787 --> 09:14.188
It's just... weird dream stuff.

09:19.995 --> 09:22.897
Oh man, my future is horrible.

09:23.966 --> 09:27.769
But even with a mustache,
Ally's still pretty.

09:30.172 --> 09:33.775
So are you sure you're going to be okay
shooting your ex-girlfriend's commercial?

09:33.777 --> 09:35.176
Trish, I'm a director.

09:35.178 --> 09:38.012
I can be professional and
put my emotions aside.

09:38.014 --> 09:40.048
So it doesn't bother you

09:40.050 --> 09:42.116
that the commercial is
about a passionate romance

09:42.118 --> 09:43.785
between Carrie and her
hunky male co-star?

09:43.787 --> 09:48.222
What? Emotions!

09:49.158 --> 09:52.193
Whoa. Speaking of hunks...

09:54.630 --> 09:56.070
Tell me that's not
Carrie's co-star.

09:56.100 --> 09:57.298
Tell me that's not
Carrie's co-star.

09:57.300 --> 10:00.168
Hi, I'm Carrie's costar.

10:00.170 --> 10:02.136
Can we talk camera angles?

10:02.138 --> 10:07.208
You see, I'm worried that the left side
of my face is only super handsome.

10:08.243 --> 10:11.245
Whereas the right side of my
face is super, super handsome.

10:14.149 --> 10:17.185
- Both sides seem fine.
- Very fine.

10:17.187 --> 10:19.020
Trish de LA rosa, manager.

10:19.022 --> 10:20.321
Newly single.

10:20.323 --> 10:23.224
Hi. Oh, and I noticed
that my left pec

10:23.226 --> 10:25.526
is a tiny bit more
pronounced than my right.

10:25.528 --> 10:28.096
Do my pecs seem lopsided to you?

10:29.932 --> 10:32.000
I'm gonna have to look
at them more closely.

10:35.205 --> 10:37.105
Okay, people,

10:37.107 --> 10:39.407
let's get into wardrobe and
get this thing over with.

10:51.186 --> 10:53.287
All right, this
part's not too bad.

11:07.870 --> 11:09.570
Not loving this part so much.

11:17.279 --> 11:18.446
Cut!

11:20.249 --> 11:22.016
Dez, what are you doing?

11:22.018 --> 11:23.918
I can't watch Carrie
with that guy.

11:24.887 --> 11:27.055
Look, he can't keep
his eyes off her.

11:30.092 --> 11:31.926
I think you're overreacting.

11:31.928 --> 11:34.062
Well, I don't think you're
overreacting enough!

11:34.064 --> 11:36.998
I have to change the entire
concept of this commercial.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.034
Whoo! Okay.

11:40.036 --> 11:45.273
New plan. When you smell the fragrance,
I want you to think, "yech!"

11:45.275 --> 11:48.876
"Get that as far away
from me as possible."

11:48.878 --> 11:55.216
Now, instead of a boring old
kiss, let's end on a high five!

11:55.218 --> 11:57.051
No touching. Let's try it.

11:57.053 --> 11:59.320
And action.

12:00.522 --> 12:04.225
Ooh! And after the high five,
let's all dance like chickens.

12:07.429 --> 12:10.298
What is going on here?

12:10.300 --> 12:12.934
Your concept wasn't working.

12:12.936 --> 12:16.104
- Need I say more?
- Yes, you need say more!

12:16.106 --> 12:20.074
Dez, Emu... it's about
fire and passion!

12:20.076 --> 12:23.077
Not silly high-fivery
and chicken dancing!

12:23.079 --> 12:26.047
I demand you return to
the original script!

12:26.049 --> 12:28.950
I can't! It's your star.
I can't work with her.

12:28.952 --> 12:30.184
I quit!

12:40.362 --> 12:41.629
Phew.

12:41.631 --> 12:44.031
Okay, I am finished recording.

12:44.033 --> 12:46.100
I know that our wedding
presentation is tomorrow morning,

12:46.102 --> 12:47.935
and I'm ready to
rock this thing.

12:47.937 --> 12:50.605
- So what's left to do?
- I already did everything.

12:51.673 --> 12:54.308
Oh. Wow!

12:54.310 --> 12:59.180
Aww! You made the lily and
orchid bouquet that I wanted.

12:59.182 --> 13:02.383
Oh! And you did the
invitation and calligraphy.

13:03.318 --> 13:05.253
Who's "fish sticks,
bubble gum train"?

13:06.221 --> 13:08.022
That's not what it says!

13:08.024 --> 13:10.525
Sorry, I'm not a
professional fancy writer.

13:10.527 --> 13:12.426
I did the best I
could with no help.

13:13.362 --> 13:14.662
Are you mad?

13:14.664 --> 13:17.565
You know I really
wanted to be here.

13:17.567 --> 13:20.968
You made it sound like you had
the assignment under control.

13:20.970 --> 13:24.172
- This isn't about the assignment.
- Then what is this about?

13:24.174 --> 13:25.706
I don't know. It's just...

13:25.708 --> 13:27.708
I'm worried about our
future together.

13:27.710 --> 13:30.178
First, you're too busy
for our presentation,

13:30.180 --> 13:31.679
and next thing you know,
you've got a mustache

13:31.681 --> 13:33.581
and you're off to Egypt to
look at the eiffel tower.

13:33.583 --> 13:35.683
Our octuplets deserve
better than that.

13:37.186 --> 13:39.420
I don't know what
any of that means.

13:39.422 --> 13:42.190
It means maybe this fake
engagement was a mistake.

13:58.141 --> 14:01.075
Austin, I'm so sorry.

14:01.077 --> 14:05.213
I've been so busy, I lost
track of what's important.

14:05.215 --> 14:07.215
Maybe I overreacted.

14:08.150 --> 14:11.385
I had this weird dream about our future
where you completely pushed me aside.

14:11.387 --> 14:14.355
I promise I will never
push you aside.

14:14.357 --> 14:15.756
Now scooch aside.

14:17.626 --> 14:20.161
We've been a lot of
things over the years...

14:21.096 --> 14:24.699
Friends, boyfriend and girlfriend,
ex-boyfriend and ex-girlfriend,

14:24.701 --> 14:26.767
- friends again...
- I think I get it.

14:27.803 --> 14:31.205
But... we've always
been great partners.

14:32.140 --> 14:34.308
And I'm so lucky to have you.

14:35.344 --> 14:38.246
Thanks, Ally. I
feel the same way.

14:41.617 --> 14:44.085
I'm gonna go pack up the
stuff for our presentation.

14:44.087 --> 14:46.153
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Okay. Bye.

14:51.093 --> 14:53.494
How am I gonna make
it up to you, Austin?

14:53.496 --> 14:55.329
Bounce house?

14:55.331 --> 14:57.431
I have an idea.

14:57.433 --> 15:01.602
I'm gonna stay up all night and
make your dream wedding cake.

15:01.604 --> 15:02.837
Well, thank you. Mwah!

15:02.839 --> 15:04.472
Oh, Austin, stop it.

15:04.474 --> 15:06.607
Oh, stop it, stop it.

15:06.609 --> 15:09.210
Oh, let's dance.

15:13.515 --> 15:16.250
I came back to get my sweater.

15:16.252 --> 15:17.652
I'll just go get a new one.

15:22.190 --> 15:24.191
This one is smolder nine.

15:24.193 --> 15:28.362
Similar to smolder seven,
but a little more smoldery.

15:29.631 --> 15:31.699
I still like smolder three.

15:31.701 --> 15:33.367
You know, that's
my favorite, too.

15:33.369 --> 15:35.336
We have so much in common.

15:40.108 --> 15:42.610
Trish, can you give
this letter to Dez?

15:42.612 --> 15:43.778
Mm-hmm.

15:45.681 --> 15:47.782
- It's blank.
- Exactly.

15:47.784 --> 15:50.751
- I have nothing to say to him.
- Okay, Carrie,

15:50.753 --> 15:54.455
I know you're mad, but Dez is just
heartbroken because you dumped him.

15:54.457 --> 15:55.890
- I dumped him?
- Uh-huh.

15:55.892 --> 15:59.260
- He dumped me.
- What are you talking about?

15:59.262 --> 16:02.763
We were at dinner, celebrating
our half-birthday...

16:02.765 --> 16:05.900
we have the same half-birthday,
but not the same actual birthday.

16:05.902 --> 16:10.705
Everything was great, until
Dez broke up with me.

16:10.707 --> 16:14.175
Wait. Okay, Carrie, walk me
through exactly what happened.

16:15.444 --> 16:18.779
We finished eating, and when the
waiter came to take our plate,

16:18.781 --> 16:22.316
out of nowhere, Dez
said, "we're done."

16:23.185 --> 16:26.187
You have got to be kidding me.

16:27.622 --> 16:30.791
Carrie, when Dez
said, "we're done,"

16:30.793 --> 16:33.894
he was just telling the waiter
you were done with your meal.

16:33.896 --> 16:36.397
- Oh!
- Yeah.

16:37.332 --> 16:40.234
Wait. Oh!

16:40.236 --> 16:43.237
- Wait.
- So?

16:43.239 --> 16:45.573
At dinner that night you said,
"I don't wanna date you."

16:45.575 --> 16:48.376
I said, "I don't want a date.
Eww."

16:48.378 --> 16:50.678
You know I don't like
figs, prunes, or dates.

16:51.613 --> 16:53.656
Well, if I didn't break up
with you and you didn't

16:53.687 --> 16:55.846
break up with me, you know
what that means, don't you?

17:04.526 --> 17:06.961
It means you never broke up.

17:06.963 --> 17:09.763
- You're still a couple!
- Yay!

17:29.918 --> 17:33.554
Wow. You really went all out!

17:33.556 --> 17:36.424
I stayed up all
night making this.

17:36.426 --> 17:38.893
It's Austin's favorite flavor...
white chocolate.

17:38.895 --> 17:40.594
I wanted to do something
special for him

17:40.596 --> 17:42.596
to let him know that he
can always count on me.

17:42.598 --> 17:44.465
Now I have 10 minutes
to get to school.

17:44.467 --> 17:46.467
- Well, let me see how it tastes.
- Hey!

17:46.469 --> 17:49.470
No one touches that frosting.

17:50.405 --> 17:53.774
- All six layers have to be perfect.
- Okay.

17:54.976 --> 17:56.544
Okay.

18:03.618 --> 18:06.887
- All five layers have to be perfect.
- Okay.

18:06.889 --> 18:09.290
- Come on.
- Okay.

18:09.292 --> 18:11.759
- We gotta go, we gotta go.
- Nice and easy.

18:11.761 --> 18:13.561
- Okay.
- Nice and easy, Ally.

18:13.563 --> 18:15.930
- Yeah, but we gotta hurry!
- Oh!

18:21.303 --> 18:24.038
You know, four layers
should be plenty.

18:29.778 --> 18:30.692
I'm so proud of you.

18:30.723 --> 18:34.348
I never thought I'd see the day
when I give my favorite boy away.

18:34.350 --> 18:37.485
Austin, we're waiting for
you to give your report.

18:37.487 --> 18:38.147
Where's Ally?

18:38.178 --> 18:40.818
Just give us a minute, lady.
This is our special day.

18:42.891 --> 18:46.794
Oh! I made it down the stairs.

18:46.796 --> 18:50.664
- That was the hardest part.
- He lost an arm.

18:51.960 --> 18:53.801
- It's fine, whatever. Just put him on.
- Okay.

18:53.803 --> 18:55.069
- All right, let's go.
- Oh!

18:55.071 --> 18:57.438
- Ooh!
- Oh!

18:58.707 --> 19:01.408
- Trish!
- Sorry.

19:01.410 --> 19:03.811
But who really needs
more than three layers?

19:07.382 --> 19:08.949
What are you doing here again?

19:08.951 --> 19:10.985
I told you, you're
not in my class.

19:10.987 --> 19:13.721
Did you really think I was going
to miss my best friend's wedding?

19:13.723 --> 19:16.457
It's not a wedding. It's
a budget presentation.

19:16.459 --> 19:18.025
Oh.

19:18.027 --> 19:19.860
Then what are you doing here?

19:19.862 --> 19:22.496
I'm the teacher.

19:22.498 --> 19:24.498
Where is Ally?

19:25.800 --> 19:28.002
Maybe she got cold feet, buddy.

19:31.640 --> 19:33.774
- That's all right. We got it.
- We got it.

19:33.776 --> 19:35.009
- We gotta hurry.
- Okay, here we go.

19:35.011 --> 19:36.410
- Ready?
- Okay.

19:36.412 --> 19:38.979
- Step.
- Okay. Oh! Okay. Okay.

19:38.981 --> 19:40.848
- We got it. We got it.
- Okay. Hey, we're here.

19:40.850 --> 19:42.016
- We're good.
- We got it.

19:42.018 --> 19:44.018
- Look out!
- Oh!

19:44.020 --> 19:46.086
Oh, come on!

19:49.491 --> 19:53.060
- Austin, we can't wait any longer.
- I assure you, she's coming.

19:53.062 --> 19:54.695
I've heard that before.

19:54.697 --> 19:56.964
"Just running to the
store," he said.

19:56.966 --> 19:59.133
And I never saw Philip again.

20:01.703 --> 20:03.771
Move it! Out of the way!

20:03.773 --> 20:05.039
Cake coming through!

20:05.041 --> 20:07.107
Almost there.

20:07.109 --> 20:09.543
Don't worry, buddy.
I'll go find Ally.

20:21.456 --> 20:22.790
Found her!

20:22.792 --> 20:25.693
Oh. Oh. Okay.

20:26.861 --> 20:28.963
- Ally, you made it!
- I'm here!

20:28.965 --> 20:31.799
And... I made cake.

20:32.734 --> 20:35.035
It's white buttercream choc...

20:35.037 --> 20:36.170
okay, whatever. It's cake.

20:36.172 --> 20:42.109
I swear, it was six layers, had
everything you wanted and was perfect.

20:42.111 --> 20:44.511
It's true. If you
really want to see it,

20:44.513 --> 20:46.981
there's a layer in the quad...
and the mall...

20:46.983 --> 20:50.050
And the music factory.
Really, it's everywhere.

20:51.052 --> 20:53.654
I'm just happy you're here.

20:53.656 --> 20:55.556
And I can't believe
you made our cake.

20:56.491 --> 20:59.493
We might not be able to eat it, but
there's still enough to do this.

20:59.495 --> 21:01.795
Boop!

21:02.964 --> 21:05.799
That would've been a lot cuter if you
weren't already covered in cake.

21:05.801 --> 21:08.602
Oh? Like this?

21:15.944 --> 21:18.612
This is sweet and all, but can you
please start your presentation?

21:18.614 --> 21:20.581
Shh! You're ruining the moment!

21:20.583 --> 21:22.750
Oh, just kiss her already.

21:30.191 --> 21:32.626
Is that pork fried rice?

21:32.628 --> 21:35.029
Yeah, that was all I could
get on short notice.

22:08.997 --> 22:10.864
Perfect!

22:10.866 --> 22:14.535
I would clap, but I'm not
wearing my clapping gloves.

22:15.570 --> 22:16.770
Seriously?

22:16.772 --> 22:19.840
Are you trying to sell perfume
or give children nightmares?

22:24.112 --> 22:26.013
Emu.
