WEBVTT

00:02.940 --> 00:05.689
Sorry to trouble you at home, ma'am,
but we've picked up a bystander

00:05.740 --> 00:08.890
999 on an active abduction of a
young female in the Moss Heath area.

00:08.940 --> 00:10.770
We've being looking for him for months.

00:10.820 --> 00:13.650
We're going to get this bastard, yeah!

00:13.700 --> 00:15.490
A 24-year-old man has been charged.

00:15.540 --> 00:17.970
Huntley's definitely hiding
something about how the case

00:18.020 --> 00:20.320
against Farmer was handled.
What, I don't know.

00:21.340 --> 00:23.650
There's the man you should
be looking for up there.

00:23.700 --> 00:24.980
Not Michael Farmer.

00:27.620 --> 00:30.220
- You all right?
- I need to go back to work.

00:33.420 --> 00:35.770
What have you got against Michael Farmer,

00:35.820 --> 00:38.320
except him being retarded
enough for you to frame?!

00:42.180 --> 00:45.890
He was one of our own. I'm going to get
on with finding the bastard that did this.

00:45.940 --> 00:48.170
I'm the senior ranking
officer here, darling.

00:48.220 --> 00:51.290
I'm only putting you back where
you belong. What are friends for?

00:51.340 --> 00:52.380
Hmm?

00:56.660 --> 00:59.130
Hana Reznikova was the last
person known to have had contact

00:59.180 --> 01:00.330
with the victim.

01:00.380 --> 01:03.170
Hana Reznikova, I am arresting
you in connection with the murder

01:03.220 --> 01:04.459
of Timothy Ifield.

01:08.500 --> 01:10.530
Fingertips were amputated postmortem.

01:10.580 --> 01:13.370
So, we're surmising that Tim tried
to grab a handful of his assailant.

01:13.420 --> 01:15.810
To get some skin cells
under his fingernails.

01:15.860 --> 01:17.780
A swab of worktop blood spatter.

01:19.980 --> 01:22.890
Item reference KRG-13.

01:22.940 --> 01:25.330
I'm just after some background
info on an item of evidence

01:25.380 --> 01:28.370
from Tim Ifield's flat. KRG-13.

01:28.420 --> 01:31.340
- She went to the forensic office.
- What is she up to?

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:40.340 --> 01:42.450
You witnessed a cab outside
the flats around 11pm

01:42.500 --> 01:43.850
on the night of the 17th?

01:43.900 --> 01:45.170
I think it was a cab.

01:45.220 --> 01:47.090
Can you describe the driver?

01:47.140 --> 01:50.690
Image enhancement got a reg number
on the vehicle seen near Tim's flat.

01:50.740 --> 01:52.940
It belongs to a Nicholas Huntley.

01:57.020 --> 01:59.420
Nick Huntley could be dangerous. Call in.

02:15.380 --> 02:18.170
- I didn't know what else to do.
- Just tell me what happened.

02:18.220 --> 02:20.610
- DS Arnold came to see me...
- Arnott.

02:20.660 --> 02:23.890
Arnott, came to see me, and, well...

02:23.940 --> 02:26.140
he ended up falling down the stairs.

02:29.540 --> 02:30.980
Oh, my God.

02:31.980 --> 02:33.250
Jesus Christ!

02:33.300 --> 02:35.330
- He's still alive?
- I don't know.

02:35.380 --> 02:37.810
At least you had the presence
of mind to go out and use

02:37.860 --> 02:39.690
- a pay phone to call me.
- Yes.

02:39.740 --> 02:42.450
I thought maybe I should, because
he mentioned telephone calls,

02:42.500 --> 02:46.170
DS Arnott, between us
that he was investigating.

02:46.220 --> 02:47.490
What calls?

02:47.540 --> 02:49.690
On the night you told me you
were working and you left

02:49.740 --> 02:51.460
your phone at home.

02:52.500 --> 02:57.170
He called me, Roz, and so I called
Jimmy Lakewell straight away.

02:57.220 --> 03:00.250
And he said not to make any
further comment to him.

03:00.300 --> 03:02.020
About what?

03:03.460 --> 03:04.450
Come on, Nick!

03:04.500 --> 03:08.050
He wanted to know your whereabouts
on the night that you said

03:08.100 --> 03:09.660
that you were working.

03:12.900 --> 03:16.930
- Why? - I don't know, I
can't remember. He was...

03:16.980 --> 03:20.410
He was pressuring me and he was
coming up and then I thought,

03:20.460 --> 03:23.890
- maybe, he'd gone to the old floor.
I don't know. - Pressuring you how?

03:23.940 --> 03:25.770
Well, he was saying
stuff. He was pushing me.

03:25.820 --> 03:28.330
- "He was saying stuff."
- Don't start, Roz!

03:28.380 --> 03:32.220
You're the one who's started and
I'm left with the mess to clear up!

03:34.340 --> 03:37.450
Is there a way to get into
your building avoiding CCTV?

03:37.500 --> 03:38.970
Yes. That's the one I've just used.

03:39.020 --> 03:41.770
Good. Get up to whatever
floor you're meant to be on.

03:41.820 --> 03:45.170
Phone security, tell them to
go and look for DS Arnott.

03:45.220 --> 03:47.450
You're worried he's got lost
somewhere in the building.

03:47.500 --> 03:48.570
What if somebody sees us?

03:48.620 --> 03:51.210
This is not an abstruse
point of corporate law, Nick.

03:51.260 --> 03:54.020
This is real crime and
I do this for a living.

03:55.180 --> 03:56.500
Go on.

03:57.620 --> 03:58.860
Go!

04:33.780 --> 04:34.810
I'm his gaffer. How is he?

04:34.860 --> 04:37.890
Too early to say for
certain. He's in a bad way.

04:37.940 --> 04:39.090
Yes. So what happened?

04:39.140 --> 04:41.650
Security guard found him
at the bottom of the stairs.

04:41.700 --> 04:46.140
Didn't see anyone else around.
Injuries are consistent with a fall.

04:47.260 --> 04:48.370
Mother of God.

04:48.420 --> 04:49.930
That's him, sir, that's her husband.

04:49.980 --> 04:52.690
Right. This is no accident,
until proven otherwise!

04:52.740 --> 04:55.010
OK. I want this place locked
down as a crime scene!

04:55.060 --> 04:56.850
Full forensic deployment!

04:56.900 --> 04:58.330
- Nicholas Huntley?
- Yes.

04:58.380 --> 05:00.770
You're a material witness to
the events surrounding the

05:00.820 --> 05:03.890
serious injury of a serving police
officer going about his lawful duty.

05:03.940 --> 05:06.010
- I don't know anything.
- Save it, fella. Look, you know,

05:06.060 --> 05:08.170
you can do this voluntarily
or we can do it the hard way.

05:08.220 --> 05:10.010
Right. I want him detained for forensics.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.370
And, James, you're in charge.
Right, you lot. I'm with you.

05:12.420 --> 05:14.540
We'll need your clothes, Mr Huntley.

05:17.300 --> 05:18.700
Come with me.

05:37.780 --> 05:41.540
En route with P1, GCS 9. ETA five minutes.

05:52.060 --> 05:53.370
Thank you.

05:53.420 --> 05:55.410
Jimmy, thanks for the
change of clothes, mate.

05:55.460 --> 05:58.090
There's no way am I letting you
go round looking like you're

05:58.140 --> 05:59.300
already convicted.

06:01.740 --> 06:04.210
Detective Sergeant Arnott

06:04.260 --> 06:07.690
phoned me to arrange a
follow-up interview.

06:07.740 --> 06:11.770
He informed me that he was
outside my firm's building,

06:11.820 --> 06:15.570
and that he was on his way to up
to my office and then he hung up.

06:15.620 --> 06:18.370
And when he didn't arrive, it was
at that moment that I realised

06:18.420 --> 06:20.490
that he must have gone to our old floor.

06:20.540 --> 06:22.650
As soon as I realised
DS Arnott's mistake...

06:22.700 --> 06:25.330
My officer made no
mistake. He was on to you.

06:25.380 --> 06:28.330
You were the only person
who knew where he was.

06:28.380 --> 06:30.170
We weren't born yesterday, fella!

06:30.220 --> 06:32.770
We all appreciate that you're
concerned for your officer's

06:32.820 --> 06:36.100
condition, but, come on, let's
dial down the Ian Paisley!

06:37.980 --> 06:40.490
You fancy yourself as a
bit of a comedian, do you?

06:40.540 --> 06:44.290
I have a man in the hospital.
That's no laughing matter.

06:44.340 --> 06:46.970
Nick and I are old colleagues,
so I've got more than

06:47.020 --> 06:49.970
a professional interest in
my client's fair treatment,

06:50.020 --> 06:52.890
so no-one would be happier than
me if your whole department

06:52.940 --> 06:55.730
stopped looking like they want to
blame Nick and started realising

06:55.780 --> 06:59.330
that your officer's fall resulted
from an unfortunate accident.

06:59.380 --> 07:01.090
My officer was highly trained.

07:01.140 --> 07:03.410
He's a former
counter-terrorism team leader.

07:03.460 --> 07:08.090
He did not slip and fall down three
flights of stairs by "accident".

07:08.140 --> 07:09.290
He was pushed.

07:09.340 --> 07:12.010
And you were the only person who
knew he was there, Mr Huntley.

07:12.060 --> 07:15.050
Coincidence. A complete coincidence.

07:15.100 --> 07:18.730
The security guard, he's got
no idea how DS Arnott's attacker

07:18.780 --> 07:21.970
could have accessed the
building without him knowing.

07:22.020 --> 07:23.930
Unless he was in there already.

07:23.980 --> 07:26.370
You can't be suggesting that
Nick was responsible for your

07:26.420 --> 07:27.570
officer's fall.

07:27.620 --> 07:30.330
He was two flights up in an
office full of colleagues.

07:30.380 --> 07:33.250
The office manager told us
Mr Huntley left the office for

07:33.300 --> 07:36.090
approximately 15 minutes around
the time DS Arnott sustained his

07:36.140 --> 07:38.450
- injuries.
- I went to the toilet.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.650
Yeah. I thought you were
waiting for DS Arnott?

07:40.700 --> 07:43.580
He didn't appear. I got butterflies.

07:44.820 --> 07:47.650
Do you have any evidence to the contrary?

07:47.700 --> 07:51.540
We're looking at the whole picture,
the whole picture. DC Desford.

07:53.300 --> 07:54.660
Uh, yeah... erm...

07:59.580 --> 08:01.930
Traffic camera video capture...

08:01.980 --> 08:03.290
March 17th.

08:03.340 --> 08:07.540
Good. You recognise
this vehicle, Mr Huntley?

08:10.220 --> 08:12.170
Help him, DC Desford.

08:12.220 --> 08:14.730
For the tape, the
interviewee is being shown

08:14.780 --> 08:16.660
a vehicle registration number.

08:18.300 --> 08:19.450
That's my car.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.890
So we have this vehicle crossing
this junction and then coming

08:21.940 --> 08:23.250
back a few hours later.

08:23.300 --> 08:26.130
Now, the reason we're interested
in this particular junction is

08:26.180 --> 08:30.490
because it serves an address just a
few hundred yards away where, on the

08:30.540 --> 08:34.580
night in question, a member of the
police forensic staff was murdered.

08:38.780 --> 08:39.900
Timothy Ifield.

08:44.740 --> 08:48.090
I... I've got nothing
to do with any murder.

08:48.140 --> 08:51.490
We also have a witness
saying a vehicle matching this

08:51.540 --> 08:54.490
description and a driver matching
your description was seen

08:54.540 --> 08:57.210
outside the address where
the murder took place.

08:57.260 --> 09:00.730
Are you seriously suggesting
that Nick is a suspect?

09:00.780 --> 09:02.090
No. One step at a time.

09:02.140 --> 09:04.890
I'd just like to know if Mr
Huntley saw anything on the night

09:04.940 --> 09:07.570
in question that might
help us with our inquiries?

09:07.620 --> 09:09.970
No, I didn't. No. Sorry.

09:10.020 --> 09:13.450
You see, normally in a situation
like this someone's mobile phone

09:13.500 --> 09:15.930
would give us their location
every second of the night.

09:15.980 --> 09:18.410
However, you conveniently
left yours at home.

09:18.460 --> 09:22.170
The man forgot his phone. It's
simple as that, nothing sinister.

09:22.220 --> 09:26.170
Right. Well, perhaps Mr Huntley
can tell us where he was, exactly,

09:26.220 --> 09:27.530
on that night?

09:27.580 --> 09:30.380
Nick isn't obliged to
give you that information.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.300
Very well.

09:35.860 --> 09:39.490
Let's move on to your wife,
Detective Chief Inspector Huntley.

09:39.540 --> 09:41.770
Now, on the night in question, the 17th,

09:41.820 --> 09:46.170
when you were out for that drive,
she's claimed she was at home, sick.

09:46.220 --> 09:47.500
DC Desford.

09:48.980 --> 09:50.020
Yeah. Um...

09:54.380 --> 09:58.890
A call to your wife's mobile
was made at around 8pm.

09:58.940 --> 10:03.740
So, why the call, when
she said she was home?

10:04.980 --> 10:06.650
Our kids made that call.

10:06.700 --> 10:09.980
They didn't realise that she
was asleep in the spare room.

10:11.940 --> 10:13.970
In the spare room?

10:14.020 --> 10:18.290
Yes. So, she wouldn't give
me her illness or disturb me,

10:18.340 --> 10:20.220
if she had a sleepless night.

10:22.820 --> 10:24.180
DC Desford.

10:25.740 --> 10:26.900
Yeah... Um...

10:33.060 --> 10:34.810
Image 47.

10:34.860 --> 10:38.650
This is a frame of CCTV captured
on the evening of January 25th

10:38.700 --> 10:40.140
in the Moss Heath area.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.970
You wouldn't happen to be
able to help us identify this

10:44.020 --> 10:45.820
particular individual?

10:48.060 --> 10:50.170
Mr Huntley?

10:50.220 --> 10:52.380
Take your time, Nick.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.060
The 25th.

10:59.940 --> 11:01.210
Yes.

11:01.260 --> 11:05.490
Yes. I was at a work function
in Northampton that evening.

11:05.540 --> 11:07.060
So, I can't help you.

11:08.420 --> 11:11.210
And I bet there are loads of
witnesses to corroborate that?

11:11.260 --> 11:15.410
- Yes. - Great. Thanks, I hope
that's covered. Anything else?

11:15.460 --> 11:18.970
Do you have any of your
officer's DNA on my client?

11:19.020 --> 11:20.690
Any of his clothes fibres?

11:20.740 --> 11:24.460
I can ask the same regarding the
murder of this Timothy Ifield.

11:26.180 --> 11:27.780
Inquiries are ongoing.

11:30.180 --> 11:33.050
They've got no witnesses. No CCTV.

11:33.100 --> 11:34.930
No forensics.

11:34.980 --> 11:36.850
My client's given full cooperation.

11:36.900 --> 11:40.570
Either you arrest him under
Code G or he's free to go.

11:40.620 --> 11:44.410
This inquiry isn't finished,
not by a long chalk.

11:44.460 --> 11:47.730
Don't you kid yourselves,
fellas. DC Desford.

11:47.780 --> 11:51.620
When my officer wakes up,
he'll have a tale to tell.

11:54.100 --> 11:56.060
Then we'll see what's what.

12:04.740 --> 12:07.300
You want to sharpen up
your act there, James.

12:09.060 --> 12:10.300
Sir.

12:19.100 --> 12:21.010
Kate, what are you doing
here? You could be seen.

12:21.060 --> 12:22.730
I had to come, sir. How is he?

12:22.780 --> 12:26.050
He's got fractures of his
right leg, pelvis, vertebrae,

12:26.100 --> 12:28.090
fractured skull, some busted ribs.

12:28.140 --> 12:30.450
I mean, they've operated, but
the nurse says it's too early

12:30.500 --> 12:32.010
to say anything, so...

12:32.060 --> 12:34.660
You can never find a bloody
doctor when you want one.

12:44.180 --> 12:49.330
You ought to look at this.
CCTV from Steve's fall.

12:49.380 --> 12:51.650
I thought we'd drawn a blank?

12:51.700 --> 12:55.420
I got this from neighbouring
premises overlooking an alleyway.

13:00.700 --> 13:01.850
Good God.

13:01.900 --> 13:03.450
Timing fits with Steve's fall, sir.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.890
- This was just a few minutes after.
- Well, there you have it.

13:05.940 --> 13:08.530
Balaclava Man, he can't be Michael
Farmer, he can't be Tim Ifield.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.330
It's looking like he
could be Nick Huntley.

13:10.380 --> 13:12.730
No traces of Steve's blood or
DNA were found on Nick Huntley.

13:12.780 --> 13:13.890
No clothes fibres, either.

13:13.940 --> 13:16.410
Nor any fibres that might relate
to the Balaclava Man outfit.

13:16.460 --> 13:19.050
Yeah, but this is no coincidence.
Huntley's definitely involved.

13:19.100 --> 13:20.890
He's the only person who
knew where Steve was.

13:20.940 --> 13:22.770
- What? Do you think he
tipped somebody off? - No.

13:22.820 --> 13:25.010
Huntley only made one phone
call after Steve's initial

13:25.060 --> 13:27.450
voicemail, which was to his
solicitor, seeking legal advice.

13:27.500 --> 13:29.970
Right, so it's all down to Steve
identifying Huntley as his

13:30.020 --> 13:31.380
- assailant.
- Sir.

13:32.620 --> 13:34.090
What about the Tim Ifield murder?

13:34.140 --> 13:35.970
Any more connections
with Nick Huntley there?

13:36.020 --> 13:38.330
Maneet's studied all the
traffic cameras in the vicinity

13:38.380 --> 13:39.810
of Tim Ifield's flat.

13:39.860 --> 13:42.250
There were no other sightings
of Nick Huntley's vehicle

13:42.300 --> 13:44.410
- for the night of Tim's murder.
- Come on, son.

13:44.460 --> 13:46.890
Steve Arnott's up in intensive
care and you've gone into

13:46.940 --> 13:48.380
full steam reverse!

13:54.180 --> 13:57.050
If they had anything, they'd
have held you. Trust me.

13:57.100 --> 13:59.690
- It's fine.
- Hey, hey!

13:59.740 --> 14:04.690
They showed me a CCTV picture of
some scary bloke in a balaclava.

14:04.740 --> 14:07.380
It's to do with this death, this murder.

14:11.180 --> 14:15.020
Why were they asking you questions
about Timothy Ifield's murder?

14:16.180 --> 14:17.610
What haven't you told me?

14:17.660 --> 14:20.130
Jesus Christ, Roz, you've got a nerve.

14:20.180 --> 14:23.570
You're the one that's doing
all the lying, not me.

14:23.620 --> 14:26.450
I'm going to ask you again. Why were

14:26.500 --> 14:29.010
they asking you questions
about Timothy Ifield's murder?

14:29.060 --> 14:30.620
Because I was there...

14:32.940 --> 14:34.850
.. that night.

14:34.900 --> 14:37.170
They've got my car on a traffic camera

14:37.220 --> 14:39.580
a few hundred yards away from his flat.

14:43.420 --> 14:47.810
You still don't get it, do you?
The late nights. The excuses.

14:47.860 --> 14:49.090
The brush-off in bed.

14:49.140 --> 14:51.260
I knew that you had to be with someone.

14:52.700 --> 14:53.740
You followed me?

14:55.700 --> 14:57.650
I didn't intend to.

14:57.700 --> 15:00.490
But you left your phone at home
when you said that you were going

15:00.540 --> 15:03.700
to work. So I picked it up
and I tried to catch you.

15:05.180 --> 15:09.450
I saw you take a different turn
to some dodgy mini-cab firm.

15:09.500 --> 15:10.890
Jesus Christ, Nick.

15:10.940 --> 15:13.010
So, I followed that cab until you got out.

15:13.060 --> 15:17.690
I realise now it was to avoid the
traffic camera that captured my car.

15:17.740 --> 15:21.090
And I saw you walk down a side
street and I got to the end

15:21.140 --> 15:23.820
just in time to see you
go into those flats.

15:27.900 --> 15:30.370
And every minute I wanted
to bang on that door

15:30.420 --> 15:32.140
and catch the pair of you at it.

15:35.260 --> 15:37.610
But I didn't. I gave up and
I came here, I came home.

15:37.660 --> 15:39.260
To our house. To our kids.

15:40.660 --> 15:42.300
To the life that we've built.

15:44.940 --> 15:49.890
For God's sake, Nick. I had
this under control. Instead...

15:49.940 --> 15:53.330
my husband was prowling the
area that night and now they're

15:53.380 --> 15:56.660
wondering if you set up one of
their officers to be killed.

15:57.860 --> 15:59.540
That's conspiracy to murder.

16:01.980 --> 16:05.570
OK, so, what did you tell AC-12?

16:05.620 --> 16:06.810
Give me some credit,

16:06.860 --> 16:10.170
Roz, I didn't say that my
wife was with another man, OK?

16:10.220 --> 16:13.650
I covered for you. I said
that you were at home.

16:13.700 --> 16:17.650
Unwell, like you'd told them.

16:17.700 --> 16:18.740
Good.

16:20.060 --> 16:23.130
What happened in those flats
that night? Was it him?

16:23.180 --> 16:25.050
- Him?
- Was it him? Him? Him?

16:25.100 --> 16:27.180
The one that was... that was killed?

16:28.700 --> 16:31.540
No. No more lies, Roz. I want the truth.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.220
I was with someone that night.

16:45.780 --> 16:48.460
- And? - And what? - And what happened?

16:49.900 --> 16:53.540
We had feelings for each other.
And we spent the night together.

16:55.060 --> 16:58.330
A crime took place nearby.
We had nothing to do with it,

16:58.380 --> 17:01.130
we weren't even witnesses,

17:01.180 --> 17:05.020
but neither of us can admit to work
that we were in the area that night.

17:08.339 --> 17:09.619
So, he's a policeman?

17:11.339 --> 17:13.210
Married?

17:13.260 --> 17:15.569
Who?

17:15.619 --> 17:19.180
No-one you know. And it's over.

17:40.940 --> 17:42.370
Yeah, come in. Come in.

17:42.420 --> 17:45.330
Sorry to bother you, sir. I've been
looking at finding a way to place

17:45.380 --> 17:47.930
- a suspect inside of Tim's flat.
- Good.

17:47.980 --> 17:49.930
There was an item of
evidence, sir, KRG-13,

17:49.980 --> 17:52.330
the isolated blood spatter
from Tim Ifield's flat.

17:52.380 --> 17:54.970
Yes, there was some question about
the label being overwritten,

17:55.020 --> 17:57.010
but Steve and Kate didn't
think it was significant.

17:57.060 --> 17:59.410
Meaning no disrespect, sir,
but that was before we knew

17:59.460 --> 18:01.610
Nick Huntley was in the
neighbourhood that night.

18:01.660 --> 18:04.450
That raises a distinct possibility
DCI Huntley could've been

18:04.500 --> 18:07.810
deliberately misleading the
inquiry away from her husband.

18:07.860 --> 18:10.370
Look, I was thinking of sequestering
the original sample to be

18:10.420 --> 18:12.130
re-examined by an independent lab.

18:12.180 --> 18:13.530
Great. That's more like it, good.

18:13.580 --> 18:16.130
Sir, hospital just called.
Steve's regained consciousness.

18:16.180 --> 18:18.780
Thank you, Maneet. Meet
me at the lift, James.

18:21.420 --> 18:23.610
Maneet, there's a couple of
things the gaffer wants me

18:23.660 --> 18:24.970
- to look into.
- Yeah, no probs.

18:25.020 --> 18:27.610
And could you please find a way of
telling him my name's not James?

18:27.660 --> 18:30.290
Easier to turn an oil tanker.

18:30.340 --> 18:33.250
Your son showed signs of
coming round of his own accord.

18:33.300 --> 18:35.210
We lightened the sedation,

18:35.260 --> 18:39.170
he was appropriate, so we removed
the tube from Steven's throat.

18:39.220 --> 18:40.730
It's a good sign.

18:40.780 --> 18:42.970
Mr and Mrs Arnott?
Superintendent Hastings.

18:43.020 --> 18:45.570
Look, I'm very sorry, this must
be a very difficult time for you.

18:45.620 --> 18:48.250
But I've got to crack on and talk
to your son, but we'll speak later,

18:48.300 --> 18:49.660
all right?

18:59.140 --> 19:02.050
How are you, son? How are you feeling?

19:02.100 --> 19:03.370
Awful.

19:03.420 --> 19:04.850
That's the spirit.

19:04.900 --> 19:06.930
- All right.
- All right.

19:06.980 --> 19:10.490
They looking after you,
anybody needing shaking up?

19:10.540 --> 19:12.450
I'm in good hands, sir.

19:12.500 --> 19:16.370
Good. Now, if you don't mind,
we'll just get straight to it?

19:16.420 --> 19:17.810
I'll do my best.

19:17.860 --> 19:18.940
Good man.

19:20.420 --> 19:23.020
Do you remember much at all
about what happened to you?

19:25.900 --> 19:27.570
Talking on the phone

19:27.620 --> 19:30.420
to Nick Huntley, going up in the lift...

19:32.300 --> 19:36.620
.. someone jumped me, hit me over
the head. After that, it's all hazy.

19:41.580 --> 19:42.850
Right. OK.

19:42.900 --> 19:46.500
Well, we have a CCTV image here
that we'd like you to look at.

19:56.260 --> 19:58.890
Now, do you think that
could be your attacker?

19:58.940 --> 20:00.660
A lot of it's blank, sir.

20:07.620 --> 20:10.180
I'm not sure if he's the
one attacked me or...

20:12.420 --> 20:15.660
.. or I'm getting mixed up with
the images of Balaclava Man.

20:17.060 --> 20:20.460
I thought there was a baseball
bat, but he doesn't have one.

20:23.100 --> 20:25.180
Maybe I'm remembering an old case.

20:28.780 --> 20:31.730
Is there any chance that
this could be Nick Huntley?

20:31.780 --> 20:33.060
I don't know.

20:34.140 --> 20:37.060
Well, full marks for honesty, son.

20:55.340 --> 20:58.210
- Ma'am.
- Something up?

20:58.260 --> 21:01.970
I just heard something
from a mate in Forensics.

21:02.020 --> 21:05.820
AC-12 are asking to examine
evidence from Tim's flat.

21:08.140 --> 21:10.490
What evidence?

21:10.540 --> 21:14.580
KRG-13, the blood spatter
that Kate was interested in.

21:16.020 --> 21:18.730
I'm sorry, I wasn't sure
if I should say anything...

21:18.780 --> 21:19.980
Night, Jodie.

21:22.020 --> 21:24.300
OK.

21:51.660 --> 21:54.540
I realise this wasn't
purely a social invitation.

21:58.860 --> 22:02.220
I'm aware of the pitfalls of
making an official complaint.

22:03.500 --> 22:05.820
But you ought to know
what AC-12 are up to.

22:07.780 --> 22:10.100
They're trying to discredit my inquiry.

22:13.020 --> 22:17.020
I cannot imagine a more damaging
climb-down for this force.

22:22.020 --> 22:23.300
There is a solution.

22:25.060 --> 22:26.050
There is?

22:26.100 --> 22:28.450
Closing the case against Michael Farmer,

22:28.500 --> 22:31.690
securing a conviction for his awful crimes

22:31.740 --> 22:35.650
and keeping Timothy Ifield's
offences an internal matter.

22:35.700 --> 22:40.140
He's dead, there won't be a
trial, only a coroner's inquest.

22:41.940 --> 22:45.100
Why give AC-12 reign
to destroy public trust?

22:47.100 --> 22:49.460
All I need is your backing, sir.

22:54.340 --> 22:57.540
AC-12 have a habit of
using underhand tactics.

22:59.140 --> 23:00.540
It's never a fair fight.

23:02.900 --> 23:06.340
There are one or two things I could
tell you that would even things up.

23:08.140 --> 23:09.850
Thank you very much, sir.

23:09.900 --> 23:12.340
We're off duty. There's no need for "sir".

23:17.380 --> 23:21.010
This is a nice place.
Are you a regular, sir?

23:21.060 --> 23:23.130
Are you a regular?

23:23.180 --> 23:27.170
It's a convenient pit
stop. I live out of town.

23:27.220 --> 23:30.660
When it's a late finish,
the rooms aren't too shabby.

23:31.980 --> 23:33.500
I'm booked in for tonight.

23:38.220 --> 23:40.100
Am I keeping you from something?

23:41.340 --> 23:45.810
No. No. The kids help
themselves to a ready meal

23:45.860 --> 23:48.530
on a school night, when I'm on duty.

23:48.580 --> 23:51.540
And Nick's often late,
too. My husband, Nick.

23:53.020 --> 23:54.820
Yes. Lucky Nick.

23:59.460 --> 24:02.970
- Would you like another drink?
- No, I shouldn't.

24:03.020 --> 24:05.700
We're just two old friends having a drink.

24:06.860 --> 24:11.970
Tonight's just too difficult. It's
boring domestic reasons. But we...

24:12.020 --> 24:14.780
We could pick this up another evening.

24:17.980 --> 24:19.890
I'll look at my diary.

24:19.940 --> 24:23.420
Let me give you a different phone
number. Just to be discreet.

24:42.060 --> 24:46.330
This piece of evidence that AC-12
want to pull from forensics...

24:46.380 --> 24:48.490
KRG-13.

24:48.540 --> 24:50.340
.. which FI's initials are those?

24:55.940 --> 24:58.410
Kevin R Gill.

24:58.460 --> 24:59.660
Ta.

25:14.340 --> 25:16.090
I know it's a bit parky out here.

25:16.140 --> 25:20.220
No, thanks. It's easier to
talk outside the office.

25:22.660 --> 25:25.250
Listen, AC-12 have been poking
their noses in about one

25:25.300 --> 25:27.650
of your forensic samples.

25:27.700 --> 25:29.410
The label was overwritten.

25:29.460 --> 25:34.420
It looks like you wrote KRG-30
and then corrected it to KRG-13.

25:36.740 --> 25:39.250
Look, Kevin, I'm the last
person to point the finger.

25:39.300 --> 25:41.500
But AC-12, they're a different story.

25:42.780 --> 25:45.290
Look, I'm not saying I'm 100% sure,

25:45.340 --> 25:48.210
but I don't remember
overwriting any label.

25:48.260 --> 25:51.690
Well, percentages help.
What would you say? 75...

25:51.740 --> 25:54.460
- 50...?
- 80. 90.

25:56.100 --> 25:57.820
Then, how was it overwritten?

26:00.300 --> 26:02.780
- Look, I've got no
angle here, Kev. - Kevin.

26:05.220 --> 26:08.570
I'm the SIO, Kevin, and I want
to catch the bastard who killed

26:08.620 --> 26:09.660
Timothy Ifield.

26:10.700 --> 26:12.450
If there's a question mark hanging over

26:12.500 --> 26:14.690
a crucial piece of forensic
evidence, I need to know.

26:14.740 --> 26:17.050
Yeah, right. I've got
to work with you lot.

26:17.100 --> 26:19.330
No way am I going to turn round
and say that somebody's been

26:19.380 --> 26:21.930
tampering with evidence. Cos
that'll make me a whistle-blower.

26:21.980 --> 26:24.170
- And we all know what
happens to them. - Kevin...

26:24.220 --> 26:25.380
This is my fag break.

26:50.420 --> 26:52.130
You should have come to see me sooner.

26:52.180 --> 26:54.260
Yeah, sorry I... Work.

26:57.020 --> 26:58.540
We're going to take a swab.

26:59.780 --> 27:02.770
- Is that necessary?
- It won't delay anything.

27:02.820 --> 27:06.180
I'll give you a painkiller,
start you on some antibiotics.

27:09.100 --> 27:10.900
You should see a specialist.

27:13.860 --> 27:15.650
You're running a fever.

27:15.700 --> 27:17.410
I think I should sign
you off on sick leave,

27:17.460 --> 27:19.530
until the specialist sees you.

27:19.580 --> 27:21.690
There's no way I can take
time off work, I'm sorry.

27:21.740 --> 27:23.140
I just can't.

27:46.900 --> 27:48.170
Where are the kids?

27:48.220 --> 27:50.980
The high street youth club,
with a tenner between them.

27:53.220 --> 27:54.250
Nando's.

27:54.300 --> 27:56.500
On a school night?

27:58.180 --> 28:00.060
You don't want to talk to me, Roz?

28:01.380 --> 28:03.250
Of course I do.

28:03.300 --> 28:06.530
I've had a crap day, I've
got another bloody fever.

28:06.580 --> 28:09.620
I just want to take a couple
of paracetamol and zonk out.

28:16.860 --> 28:19.140
What really happened that night, Roz?

28:20.500 --> 28:22.460
The night of the murder?

28:25.140 --> 28:27.250
Because the more I think about it,

28:27.300 --> 28:29.780
the more holes there are in your story.

28:32.500 --> 28:36.780
Would you really risk
so much to hide a fling?

28:40.580 --> 28:43.730
I know I hurt you, Nick. And I am sorry.

28:43.780 --> 28:45.700
You don't seem sorry, Roz.

28:47.220 --> 28:48.260
What do I seem?

28:50.620 --> 28:52.420
Like you're still hiding something.

28:59.260 --> 29:02.570
I've stopped believing a word you say.

29:02.620 --> 29:07.650
Look at what I do, Nick, not
what I say. What I actually do.

29:07.700 --> 29:10.490
Everything is for us, for this family.

29:10.540 --> 29:12.890
No, it's all for yourself.

29:12.940 --> 29:16.380
And you had better start
treating me better.

29:18.300 --> 29:21.540
I know you were in those flats
where the murder happened.

29:22.620 --> 29:23.850
What are you trying to say?

29:23.900 --> 29:27.060
I'm saying I've had it with
being taken for a fool.

29:29.500 --> 29:32.180
Were you not listening? Look at what I do.

29:33.940 --> 29:37.250
You're linked to the near-death
of an anti-corruption detective.

29:37.300 --> 29:40.330
And you were hanging around
outside a crime scene.

29:40.380 --> 29:41.700
You are the fool.

29:44.340 --> 29:46.100
I'm the one protecting you.

30:01.460 --> 30:02.940
It's OK.

30:07.300 --> 30:08.540
It's OK.

30:11.180 --> 30:13.490
Come in.

30:13.540 --> 30:18.050
Sir, the lab's analysed the
original sample reference KRG-13.

30:18.100 --> 30:20.170
They've found an anomaly.

30:20.220 --> 30:23.220
Great. This gets better
and better. Come in.

30:37.980 --> 30:39.890
- Sorry.
- That's OK.

30:39.940 --> 30:41.660
I'm afraid it's bad news, Roz.

30:56.300 --> 31:00.090
AC-12 have issued you
with a second Reg 15.

31:00.140 --> 31:01.130
On what grounds?

31:01.180 --> 31:03.410
If they're issuing a second
one, it means they're citing

31:03.460 --> 31:06.050
a substantively different
offence from last time.

31:06.100 --> 31:07.340
OK.

31:08.660 --> 31:11.770
I'll be honest, Roz.
They're coming after you.

31:11.820 --> 31:13.730
It's not just taking you
off the case this time.

31:13.780 --> 31:16.130
It could be suspension,
dismissal from the service,

31:16.180 --> 31:17.900
maybe even criminal charges.

31:19.740 --> 31:21.140
Sorry.

31:55.820 --> 31:57.260
Thanks, Maneet.

31:59.580 --> 32:00.940
Thanks, Maneet.

32:15.380 --> 32:19.130
Anti-corruption Unit 12 interview
by Superintendent Hastings and

32:19.180 --> 32:22.130
DC Desford of Detective Chief
Inspector Roseanne Huntley, in the

32:22.180 --> 32:25.810
presence of her Police Federation
Representative DCI Mark Moffatt.

32:25.860 --> 32:28.250
Please identify yourselves for the DIR.

32:28.300 --> 32:31.650
- Hastings. - Huntley.
- Moffatt. - Desford.

32:31.700 --> 32:34.170
DCI Huntley, you do not have to
say anything, but it may harm your

32:34.220 --> 32:36.610
defence if you do not mention,
when questioned, something

32:36.660 --> 32:37.810
you later rely on in court.

32:37.860 --> 32:40.170
Anything you do say may
be used in evidence.

32:40.220 --> 32:42.930
Questions will be put to you by
Superintendent Hastings, as it

32:42.980 --> 32:46.410
is your right to be questioned by
an officer at least one rank senior.

32:46.460 --> 32:50.450
I will furnish factual information
only, starting with Image 47, from a

32:50.500 --> 32:54.170
CCTV camera captured on the night
of January 25th in the vicinity

32:54.220 --> 32:56.570
of the last confirmed
sighting of Leonie Collersdale

32:56.620 --> 32:57.730
before she disappeared.

32:57.780 --> 33:00.610
Now, this man is wearing a
black jacket of the type worn

33:00.660 --> 33:02.690
by Hana Reznikova's abductor.

33:02.740 --> 33:04.860
What steps have you taken to find him?

33:07.100 --> 33:09.100
We believe this is Michael Farmer.

33:11.100 --> 33:15.530
Image 136, from a CCTV camera
overlooking the car park

33:15.580 --> 33:18.570
of a DIY Superstore, captured
on the night of March 17th.

33:18.620 --> 33:21.650
And we believe this is Timothy Ifield.

33:21.700 --> 33:24.780
- Well, clearly there are
some similarities. - Clearly.

33:26.580 --> 33:29.850
However, Timothy Ifield
was aware of Image 47.

33:29.900 --> 33:33.970
He could have deliberately styled
himself, in order to simulate

33:34.020 --> 33:35.940
the suspect seen on January 25th.

33:43.940 --> 33:46.610
Right. Well, let's see what
you have to say about this...

33:46.660 --> 33:47.940
DC Desford.

33:49.860 --> 33:54.010
From a CCTV camera captured on
the 6th of April, in an alley

33:54.060 --> 33:56.370
adjacent to your husband's
office building.

33:56.420 --> 33:59.090
Now, Timothy Ifield, bless
him, is six foot under,

33:59.140 --> 34:03.530
so it can't be him styling
himself to simulate Balaclava Man.

34:03.580 --> 34:08.010
And Michael Farmer has been
in custody for nearly a month.

34:08.060 --> 34:11.449
Why haven't you shared this
evidence? This is my investigation!

34:11.500 --> 34:14.730
Clearly, DCI Huntley, I
would have reservations,

34:14.780 --> 34:17.770
regarding the connection to your husband.

34:17.820 --> 34:21.170
DCI Huntley's spouse was
released without charge by AC-12.

34:21.219 --> 34:23.699
You're presuming guilt before innocence.

34:28.780 --> 34:30.929
Document Seven, DC Desford.

34:30.980 --> 34:33.330
Document Seven in your folders,

34:33.380 --> 34:38.889
a photocopy made by this unit
on April 7th of a form MG-6

34:38.940 --> 34:43.850
submitted electronically by you on
April 5th to the Senior Prosecutor

34:43.900 --> 34:48.370
in the Complex Case Unit in respect
of evidence against Hana Reznikova.

34:48.420 --> 34:51.170
Do you recognise the form, DCI Huntley?

34:51.219 --> 34:52.290
Yes.

34:52.340 --> 34:55.050
Timothy Ifield's killer left
not a single strand of DNA

34:55.100 --> 34:57.370
or a single fingerprint
at the crime scene.

34:57.420 --> 35:01.690
Now, you are saying that Hana
Reznikova had the knowledge

35:01.740 --> 35:03.940
and the skills to do that?

35:05.020 --> 35:06.410
She is a cleaner, sir.

35:06.460 --> 35:09.130
Timothy Ifield's killer
amputated the second,

35:09.180 --> 35:13.570
third and fourth digits of the
victim's right hand postmortem.

35:13.620 --> 35:16.490
And what? You think she's up to that too?

35:16.540 --> 35:18.170
Yes, I do, sir,

35:18.220 --> 35:21.250
to remove her DNA lodged under
Timothy Ifield's fingernails.

35:21.300 --> 35:24.170
Right. Well, tell me this, were
there any corresponding wounds found

35:24.220 --> 35:26.810
anywhere on Hana Reznikova body?

35:26.860 --> 35:29.250
The wounds could have been
superficial enough to have

35:29.300 --> 35:31.210
healed by the time we charged her,

35:31.260 --> 35:35.250
or she might have mistakenly assumed
her DNA had contaminated the body.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.850
Kindly answer the question, DCI Huntley.

35:37.900 --> 35:41.210
Were there any corresponding wounds
found on Hana Reznikova's body,

35:41.260 --> 35:43.170
- yes or no? - No. - No.

35:43.220 --> 35:46.250
You have not got the evidence
to pass the threshold test

35:46.300 --> 35:49.770
for charging and yet you seriously
believe that that wee girl,

35:49.820 --> 35:52.730
Hana Reznikova, murdered Timothy Ifield?

35:52.780 --> 35:53.890
Yes, I do, sir.

35:53.940 --> 35:55.180
What -- and not this man?

35:56.620 --> 35:59.010
Like I said, this needs
to be investigated.

35:59.060 --> 36:00.620
Yes, our point entirely.

36:01.620 --> 36:04.250
- DC Desford.
- Document Nine.

36:04.300 --> 36:06.450
Forensic evidence log from the examination

36:06.500 --> 36:09.210
of Timothy's Ifield's
flat on the 23rd of March.

36:09.260 --> 36:10.780
Do you recognise said log?

36:12.020 --> 36:13.090
Yes, sir.

36:13.140 --> 36:16.330
Item Reference KRG-13
is recorded in said log.

36:16.380 --> 36:20.650
We would draw your attention to
the labelling of said item KRG-13.

36:20.700 --> 36:22.580
James.

36:24.700 --> 36:26.290
I'm sorry.

36:26.340 --> 36:27.890
On screen, image 12.

36:27.940 --> 36:31.570
Image 12 is a photograph taken
by this department of the label

36:31.620 --> 36:32.810
on the evidence bag.

36:32.860 --> 36:36.370
And what can you tell us about
this label, DCI Huntley?

36:36.420 --> 36:37.570
It's been overwritten.

36:37.620 --> 36:39.370
Indeed, it has. Indeed, it has.

36:39.420 --> 36:42.210
We interviewed the forensic
investigator corresponding

36:42.260 --> 36:45.410
to the designation K-R-G, Kevin R Gill.

36:45.460 --> 36:48.530
Mr Gill was unable to
account for the overwriting.

36:48.580 --> 36:50.970
That doesn't mean there's
anything suspicious here.

36:51.020 --> 36:54.050
Yeah, but we also sequestered
the original sample.

36:54.100 --> 36:55.530
Image 22 on screen.

36:55.580 --> 37:01.210
Image 22 is a crime scene photograph
captured on the 23rd March of the

37:01.260 --> 37:03.730
blood spatter detected
in Timothy Ifield's flat.

37:03.780 --> 37:05.860
Turn to document 15 in your folders.

37:07.940 --> 37:12.570
I quote from the report made by the
independent forensic scientist.

37:12.620 --> 37:15.570
"Swab sample shows
staining with human blood.

37:15.620 --> 37:18.370
"Analysis of the blood sample
detected DNA matching the

37:18.420 --> 37:21.130
"control sample for Timothy Ifield.

37:21.180 --> 37:24.010
"The probability that this
sample contains Timothy Ifield's

37:24.060 --> 37:27.180
"blood is greater than 99.9%."

37:28.980 --> 37:33.140
So far, so expected, wouldn't
you say, DCI Huntley?

37:34.180 --> 37:35.730
Yes, sir.

37:35.780 --> 37:38.980
Yes, but our independent
analysis does not end there.

37:40.140 --> 37:43.250
We've been informed of an anomaly.

37:43.300 --> 37:45.010
I quote,

37:45.060 --> 37:48.090
"Present within the blood sample
are a number of clothing fibres.

37:48.140 --> 37:49.610
"All fibres are of the same type,

37:49.660 --> 37:52.650
"suggesting they originate
from the same source.

37:52.700 --> 37:55.410
"Comparison with the
reference database reveals

37:55.460 --> 37:59.410
"a match with the white high-density
polythene of over-suits worn

37:59.460 --> 38:01.650
"by forensic investigators.

38:01.700 --> 38:05.500
"The probability of this
match is greater than 99.9%."

38:08.140 --> 38:10.490
What do you make of that, DCI Huntley?

38:10.540 --> 38:14.370
It's possible the FI taking
the sample inadvertently made

38:14.420 --> 38:17.690
contact with the swab or blood
with his own white over-suit.

38:17.740 --> 38:20.690
I mean really, do you seriously
believe that an experienced

38:20.740 --> 38:22.570
FI is going to be that clumsy?

38:22.620 --> 38:23.890
I mean... who are you kidding?

38:23.940 --> 38:27.690
Besides those suits are specifically
designed not to shed fibres.

38:27.740 --> 38:31.810
But, of course, you would know
this, wouldn't you, DCI Huntley?

38:31.860 --> 38:35.970
Being an experienced and, I'm told,
highly skilled senior detective.

38:36.020 --> 38:39.570
Superintendent Hastings,
your tone is oppressive.

38:39.620 --> 38:43.130
She's an SIO. 20 years
on the force, fella.

38:43.180 --> 38:45.300
If she can't take it, God help us all.

38:46.660 --> 38:48.540
DCI Huntley?

38:53.660 --> 38:57.090
For the DIR, the interviewee
is not answering.

38:57.140 --> 39:00.450
That swab had to be taken from
the blood-stained over-suit that

39:00.500 --> 39:02.530
Timothy Ifield was wearing
at the time of his death.

39:02.580 --> 39:06.370
And as said over-suit was not
found at the scene of the crime,

39:06.420 --> 39:10.690
it leads me to believe that the
person who took the swab was

39:10.740 --> 39:14.290
very closely connected
to the killer himself.

39:14.340 --> 39:16.460
Or... herself.

39:20.740 --> 39:25.300
That sample, KRG-13, was tampered with.

39:27.780 --> 39:29.660
DCI Huntley?

39:31.100 --> 39:32.330
Possibly.

39:32.380 --> 39:34.090
"Possibly." Look.

39:34.140 --> 39:37.650
We all know under modern policing
methods it's extremely difficult,

39:37.700 --> 39:41.050
it's nigh on impossible to plant
evidence once a crime scene

39:41.100 --> 39:45.370
has been opened. However, it is
conceivably possible to replace

39:45.420 --> 39:50.850
evidence once it's in storage if one
has access to said storage facility.

39:50.900 --> 39:54.170
Unfortunately, there's no
CCTV covering the evidence room

39:54.220 --> 39:56.370
where the samples were
stored, as it's a staff area.

39:56.420 --> 39:58.930
Security cameras only cover
areas where officers come into

39:58.980 --> 40:02.130
contact with members of the public,
for the protection of all parties.

40:02.180 --> 40:04.810
Police officers have a right to
go about their personal business

40:04.860 --> 40:07.930
- in private. - I beg to
differ. We're public servants.

40:07.980 --> 40:11.050
Everything we do, everything,
should stand up to public scrutiny.

40:11.100 --> 40:12.170
So, let's see what we have.

40:12.220 --> 40:15.210
We have the possibility of planting
evidence in the case against

40:15.260 --> 40:19.290
Michael Farmer and we have
interference in forensic

40:19.340 --> 40:22.770
evidence in the murder of Timothy Ifield.

40:22.820 --> 40:25.930
It's a complex case,
sir. In fact, two cases.

40:25.980 --> 40:27.850
It sure is.

40:27.900 --> 40:32.090
Did you investigate who had
access to Michael Farmer's home

40:32.140 --> 40:33.500
prior to his arrest?

40:36.060 --> 40:37.380
Of course we have, sir.

40:42.700 --> 40:47.770
Document 33, a copy of my
Decision Log recorded on the night

40:47.820 --> 40:51.770
of March 9th, regarding operations
at Michael Farmer's home.

40:51.820 --> 40:55.730
"21.25 FARS OIC clears property for entry.

40:55.780 --> 40:57.850
"DCI Huntley clears FARS Investigator

40:57.900 --> 40:59.860
"and FC to enter property."

41:00.900 --> 41:04.050
The FC in this case being Timothy Ifield.

41:04.100 --> 41:06.170
And Timothy Ifield's DNA was detected on

41:06.220 --> 41:08.090
Leonie Collersdale's body.

41:08.140 --> 41:12.810
Hence we are pursuing complicity
between Timothy Ifield

41:12.860 --> 41:14.020
and Michael Farmer.

41:16.660 --> 41:21.660
Do you have any evidence connecting
Michael Farmer to Timothy Ifield?

41:24.620 --> 41:25.810
- Not yet, sir.
- No.

41:25.860 --> 41:29.810
No, so this complicity between
them is just wild speculation

41:29.860 --> 41:31.530
on your part, DCI Huntley.

41:31.580 --> 41:33.970
Now, from what we know of Timothy Ifield

41:34.020 --> 41:36.290
he was probably trying
to do the exact opposite.

41:36.340 --> 41:39.090
He was probably trying to prove
Michael Farmer's innocence.

41:39.140 --> 41:43.690
You see, Timothy Ifield stumbled
upon a conspiracy to protect a

41:43.740 --> 41:48.130
person or persons unknown, possibly
the person in the CCTV footage

41:48.180 --> 41:52.770
on the 25th of January, for which
he was murdered for his silence.

41:52.820 --> 41:56.490
Now have you or your inquiry,

41:56.540 --> 42:00.460
made any effort whatsoever
to explore this possibility?

42:03.380 --> 42:04.820
We...

42:09.460 --> 42:10.890
No, we haven't, sir.

42:10.940 --> 42:16.020
No, DCI Huntley. YOU haven't. You alone.

42:19.620 --> 42:21.890
DCI Huntley's been suffering
from illness recently.

42:21.940 --> 42:24.450
Perhaps we could take a
break for a few minutes.

42:24.500 --> 42:25.860
No.

42:26.900 --> 42:29.250
I really wish that it all ended there,

42:29.300 --> 42:33.610
but sadly, Timothy Ifield was
murdered, and in respect of a prime

42:33.660 --> 42:39.460
suspect, we're looking very close
to home. Very close to home, indeed.

42:41.180 --> 42:42.970
DC Desford.

42:43.020 --> 42:44.250
Image 36.

42:44.300 --> 42:48.490
Image 36 is a frame taken from
traffic camera video recorded

42:48.540 --> 42:50.730
at 11pm on the night of March 17th.

42:50.780 --> 42:54.490
Image 36 captures a vehicle
registered to your husband,

42:54.540 --> 42:58.210
Nicholas Huntley, in the vicinity
of Timothy Ifield's flat.

42:58.260 --> 43:02.450
The night of March the 17th has
been identified as the most likely

43:02.500 --> 43:04.500
time for that murder to take place.

43:06.660 --> 43:12.810
DCI Huntley, in my view there
is a clear conflict of interest

43:12.860 --> 43:17.370
regarding your position and the
possible involvement of your husband

43:17.420 --> 43:19.250
in these offences. Also now,

43:19.300 --> 43:24.250
it is extremely difficult to exclude
you as a suspect in tampering

43:24.300 --> 43:28.570
with evidence that might implicate
your husband in said murder.

43:28.620 --> 43:33.090
Therefore I will be recommending
to the Executive Officer, in the

43:33.140 --> 43:37.850
strongest possible terms, that
you be suspended from duty,

43:37.900 --> 43:41.570
effective immediately. Now,
you are not under arrest.

43:41.620 --> 43:47.730
However, our inquiries are ongoing
and you may subsequently be arrested

43:47.780 --> 43:49.450
in connection with these offences.

43:49.500 --> 43:51.820
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

43:53.060 --> 43:55.500
- I do. - And have you
anything further to add?

43:58.860 --> 43:59.900
I do.

44:02.020 --> 44:06.210
Well, look... your Federation Rep
said you might want a break now.

44:06.260 --> 44:08.410
You said it yourself, Superintendent.

44:08.460 --> 44:11.490
I'm an SIO, 20 years in, the
tape's running, let's proceed.

44:11.540 --> 44:14.610
How many detectives of the rank
of inspector or above have you

44:14.660 --> 44:17.050
investigated in the last five years?

44:17.100 --> 44:18.930
I really don't see how that's relevant.

44:18.980 --> 44:21.610
- Do you have an answer?
- Not to hand. No.

44:21.660 --> 44:25.250
You've investigated
three, myself included.

44:25.300 --> 44:29.290
Two of the three were female, that's 67%,

44:29.340 --> 44:32.810
when the proportion of
females in those ranks is 10%.

44:32.860 --> 44:34.850
Who's giving you this information?

44:34.900 --> 44:36.250
Am I wrong?

44:36.300 --> 44:39.210
Well, that's a very small sample
to be quoting percentages out of.

44:39.260 --> 44:41.970
We've charged a Deputy Chief Constable and

44:42.020 --> 44:44.930
a retired Chief Superintendent, both male.

44:44.980 --> 44:47.730
We're only interested in one thing
here and one thing only, and

44:47.780 --> 44:53.970
that's bent coppers, irrespective
of race, creed, colour, or gender.

44:54.020 --> 44:56.540
- You're blind to gender?
- Absolutely.

44:59.340 --> 45:02.450
On the 23rd of March, in a
conversation at the scene

45:02.500 --> 45:06.300
of Timothy Ifield's murder, did
you address me as "darling"?

45:09.340 --> 45:11.890
Once again, I really don't
see how this is relevant.

45:11.940 --> 45:13.130
Yes or no, Superintendent,

45:13.180 --> 45:16.220
did you address me using a
non-gender-neutral term?

45:19.060 --> 45:20.610
Yes.

45:20.660 --> 45:23.410
How many female officers
within AC-12 have been promoted

45:23.460 --> 45:25.810
to the rank of inspector or
above in the last five years?

45:25.860 --> 45:28.730
Look, the internal workings of this
unit have absolutely no relevance

45:28.780 --> 45:31.570
to the matter in front of us now and
frankly it's none of your business.

45:31.620 --> 45:34.890
Your use of sexist language
makes me raise the matter,

45:34.940 --> 45:37.250
and, in respect of the
promotion of female officers,

45:37.300 --> 45:39.490
your unit lags behind
the national average.

45:39.540 --> 45:41.810
Yes, well, it's very specialist
work we do here and I have to

45:41.860 --> 45:44.850
think very carefully about who
I promote to senior positions.

45:44.900 --> 45:46.930
But where are you getting
this information from?

45:46.980 --> 45:48.330
Well, that's confidential.

45:48.380 --> 45:50.850
Yes, well, in that case I think
we should just terminate this

45:50.900 --> 45:52.300
interview. DC Desford.

45:54.220 --> 45:56.700
Are you a member of a
Masonic organisation?

46:00.540 --> 46:02.650
I wouldn't do that if
I were you, DC Desford.

46:02.700 --> 46:04.730
That makes you an active
participant in denying me

46:04.780 --> 46:08.020
my rights under police
regulations to defend myself.

46:21.100 --> 46:23.420
Are you or are you not a Mason?

46:25.100 --> 46:27.410
I'm not at liberty to discuss the matter.

46:27.460 --> 46:30.130
And whoever is feeding you
this prejudicial information...

46:30.180 --> 46:32.530
Masons are the mafia of the mediocre.

46:32.580 --> 46:35.290
A network of officers linked to corruption

46:35.340 --> 46:38.730
and an organisation that
traditionally excludes women.

46:38.780 --> 46:42.650
For the DIR, Superintendent
Hastings has risen from his seat.

46:42.700 --> 46:45.530
You have a record of excluding
women from positions of authority

46:45.580 --> 46:46.970
and what better way than to conduct

46:47.020 --> 46:49.370
witch hunts against
senior female officers?

46:49.420 --> 46:52.450
You're just trying to wriggle
off the hook. This won't wash.

46:52.500 --> 46:55.250
DCI Huntley has raised valid
concerns, regarding the treatment

46:55.300 --> 46:58.610
of female Police Federation
members by your department.

46:58.660 --> 47:00.850
She's laid a foundation to
explain why, in our view,

47:00.900 --> 47:02.770
the investigation against
her is malicious.

47:02.820 --> 47:07.850
Please sit down, Superintendent,
or it would seem you're denying

47:07.900 --> 47:11.340
my colleague her lawful rights
as a serving police officer.

47:19.260 --> 47:20.330
Thank you.

47:20.380 --> 47:23.050
For the DIR, Superintendent
Hastings has retaken his seat.

47:23.100 --> 47:25.490
The matter before us, Superintendent,

47:25.540 --> 47:27.890
is whether DCI Huntley's
carried out her duties

47:27.940 --> 47:30.250
and responsibilities
under police regulations.

47:30.300 --> 47:34.530
The matter is whether she has been
complicit in a criminal offence.

47:34.580 --> 47:39.370
These are photocopies of a
statement given to my team

47:39.420 --> 47:42.010
by Forensic Investigator Kevin R Gill

47:42.060 --> 47:45.010
after the statement he made to AC-12.

47:45.060 --> 47:47.930
You'll see that Mr Gill
accepts responsibility for

47:47.980 --> 47:51.410
overwriting the label item reference
KRG-13, the isolated blood

47:51.460 --> 47:53.970
spatter found at the scene
of Timothy Ifield's murder.

47:54.020 --> 47:56.210
- Now, wait a minute...
- Hold on, hold on.

47:56.260 --> 47:59.370
Now FIs depend on good
relations with police officers.

47:59.420 --> 48:02.450
Come on, he'd change his story
if he thought it would help.

48:02.500 --> 48:05.450
That's a very interesting
remark, DC Desford.

48:05.500 --> 48:08.330
You're claiming the FI says
whatever the investigating police

48:08.380 --> 48:11.090
- officer wants to hear?
- No, no, no, no... That's not...

48:11.140 --> 48:13.650
So, that would mean the FI told
AC-12 what you wanted to hear?

48:13.700 --> 48:15.410
And in order to make the case against me,

48:15.460 --> 48:18.450
you wanted to hear that he
didn't overwrite the label.

48:18.500 --> 48:20.850
That's not what I meant,
OK? That's not what I meant.

48:20.900 --> 48:23.530
I note your agitated tone, DC
Desford. Why are you agitated?

48:23.580 --> 48:25.610
Because you're putting words in my mouth.

48:25.660 --> 48:28.010
Say that again, DC Desford.

48:28.060 --> 48:30.450
For the DIR, Superintendent
Hastings has given

48:30.500 --> 48:34.100
a non-verbal gesture ordering
DC Desford not to answer.

48:35.780 --> 48:37.540
Stable door, horse bolted.

48:39.220 --> 48:42.010
You, DC Desford, volunteered
that you believe Kevin Gill

48:42.060 --> 48:44.850
made the statement AC-12 wanted
to hear, but you've accused me

48:44.900 --> 48:47.730
of fabricating that same
observation, when we all

48:47.780 --> 48:51.660
recognise the DIR will support
my version of the conversation.

48:54.940 --> 48:57.650
The problem with AC-12 is you
can never admit when you're in

48:57.700 --> 48:59.130
the wrong.

48:59.180 --> 49:01.890
And I wonder what lengths
AC-12 would go to

49:01.940 --> 49:04.700
to prove they're right,
even when they're wrong?

49:08.300 --> 49:11.490
This is a video capture
of a lawful recording

49:11.540 --> 49:14.170
of a police interview at
Polk Avenue Police Station,

49:14.220 --> 49:16.810
showing Hana Reznikova
being interviewed by

49:16.860 --> 49:19.220
'DS Flynn and DC Taylor.

49:20.780 --> 49:23.250
'The interview formed the
starting point to our inquiry

49:23.300 --> 49:24.690
'into Hana Reznikova.

49:24.740 --> 49:28.690
'At all stages of the investigation,
DS Flynn was an active participant.

49:28.740 --> 49:32.130
'In fact, she was instrumental in
the charging of Hana Reznikova.'

49:32.180 --> 49:36.100
The validity of which you challenged
earlier in this interview.

49:37.820 --> 49:41.450
This is a print of a digital
photograph captured by

49:41.500 --> 49:44.540
DC Jodie Taylor on the 4th of April.

49:48.860 --> 49:51.100
'Who is the officer in the photograph?'

49:52.500 --> 49:55.730
For the DIR, Superintendent
Hastings and DC Desford

49:55.780 --> 49:57.340
look extremely uneasy.

49:58.580 --> 50:01.210
According to DC Taylor, this detective,

50:01.260 --> 50:06.290
'DS Kate Flynn, made an inquiry
at Polk Avenue Forensic Office,'

50:06.340 --> 50:08.340
regarding item reference KRG-13.

50:11.540 --> 50:14.570
This is a print of a digital
photograph captured by

50:14.620 --> 50:19.490
DC Taylor on the 7th of
April, showing DS Flynn

50:19.540 --> 50:21.890
'having an off the
record conversation with

50:21.940 --> 50:24.260
'Forensic Investigator Kevin Gill.

50:25.700 --> 50:28.890
'Is DS Flynn an undercover AC-12 officer?

50:28.940 --> 50:30.690
'In respect of undercover operations,

50:30.740 --> 50:33.330
'I can neither confirm nor
deny, as well you know.

50:33.380 --> 50:34.850
'What we do know,'

50:34.900 --> 50:38.850
Superintendent is if an undercover
AC-12 officer is coaching witnesses

50:38.900 --> 50:42.690
against DCI Huntley, it would
substantially undermine your case.

50:42.740 --> 50:46.140
My officers do not coach witnesses!

50:47.780 --> 50:49.220
So, she is your officer?

51:00.180 --> 51:04.330
We have Kevin Gill telling AC-12
one thing and my team another

51:04.380 --> 51:08.220
and here we have an undercover
AC-12 officer talking to Gill.

51:11.580 --> 51:14.020
Let's go back to Gill's statement to me.

51:15.580 --> 51:20.130
He took a swab sample from the blood
spatter in Timothy Ifield's flat.

51:20.180 --> 51:22.690
He sealed the sample in an evidence bag.

51:22.740 --> 51:27.170
He labelled the bag overwriting
a slip of the pen, KRG-13.

51:27.220 --> 51:29.730
And despite all your theories,

51:29.780 --> 51:33.610
you have zero evidence KRG-13
was tampered with thereafter.

51:33.660 --> 51:36.660
If it was tampered with,
who could have done it?

51:39.540 --> 51:42.690
Here we have DS Flynn raising
a query about KRG-13 at the

51:42.740 --> 51:45.770
forensic office days before anyone else.

51:45.820 --> 51:48.170
And then, as if by magic,
AC-12 request the sample,

51:48.220 --> 51:50.380
to carry out your own analysis.

51:51.620 --> 51:55.940
As soon as AC-12 seized that sample,
the chain of evidence was broken.

51:57.100 --> 52:00.730
It raises the question who had
access to it after you seized it.

52:00.780 --> 52:03.780
- AC-12 do not tamper
with evidence! - No?

52:05.740 --> 52:09.170
A jury acquitted a female DI
called Lindsay Denton of conspiracy

52:09.220 --> 52:11.810
to murder at retrial, because
they were sure that one of your

52:11.860 --> 52:14.490
officers had engaged in an
inappropriately intimate

52:14.540 --> 52:16.850
relationship, in order to
plant evidence in her home.

52:16.900 --> 52:19.170
My officers do not plant evidence!

52:19.220 --> 52:21.770
You see the pattern here? Sexism,

52:21.820 --> 52:24.530
undercover operations,
and questionable evidence.

52:24.580 --> 52:27.210
All right. This circus is over.

52:27.260 --> 52:31.930
Superintendent Hastings,
did you authorise DS Flynn

52:31.980 --> 52:35.090
to engineer charges
against Hana Reznikova?

52:35.140 --> 52:36.810
I did not.

52:36.860 --> 52:39.930
'Did you authorise DS Flynn to
tamper with evidence in regard'

52:39.980 --> 52:42.570
to the investigation into the
murder of Timothy Ifield from

52:42.620 --> 52:44.450
the 23rd of March to today's date?

52:44.500 --> 52:46.250
I did not.

52:46.300 --> 52:49.490
Did you induce Forensic
Investigator Kevin Gill to alter his

52:49.540 --> 52:53.010
testimony, in regard to the handling
of evidence item reference KRG-13?

52:53.060 --> 52:54.450
I did not.

52:54.500 --> 52:55.970
Superintendent Hastings,

52:56.020 --> 52:59.690
at this time, I'm unable to
exclude you, DC Desford, DS Arnott

52:59.740 --> 53:03.610
and DS Flynn from a conspiracy to
pervert the course of justice in

53:03.660 --> 53:07.130
the actions you've brought against
me, which I believe are unfounded,

53:07.180 --> 53:10.770
vexatious and intended to
obstruct my lawful inquiries

53:10.820 --> 53:12.930
into the murders of Baswinder Kaur,

53:12.980 --> 53:16.620
Leonie Collersdale and Timothy Ifield.

53:20.940 --> 53:22.410
This is a signed authority from

53:22.460 --> 53:26.650
Assistant Chief Constable Hilton,
recusing AC-12 from your inquiry

53:26.700 --> 53:29.740
into me, my team and the above offences.

53:35.620 --> 53:38.420
DCI Huntley and DCI Moffatt
are leaving the room.

53:42.620 --> 53:44.740
Switch that bloody thing off, James.

53:51.340 --> 53:53.650
Sorry, sir, I have to
say. It's Jamie, not James.

53:53.700 --> 53:57.060
Frankly, son, right now,
I couldn't give a shit.

53:58.220 --> 54:01.610
I never planted evidence. I never
coached any witness and you know it.

54:01.660 --> 54:04.560
Hilton might have fallen for
your crap, but no-one else will.

54:05.780 --> 54:07.490
How old are you, Kate?

54:07.540 --> 54:09.450
31.

54:09.500 --> 54:12.610
I'll tell you about my road to 31.

54:12.660 --> 54:15.130
I'd been a DI two years already.

54:15.180 --> 54:18.530
Then, I made life choices in
the best interests of others.

54:18.580 --> 54:21.090
Not in my best interests,
at all, as it turned out.

54:21.140 --> 54:23.930
And from what I know, you
won't make that mistake.

54:23.980 --> 54:26.170
You'd give up anything to get to the top.

54:26.220 --> 54:27.970
But despite all your ambition,

54:28.020 --> 54:30.490
you find yourself on the
wrong side of the line.

54:30.540 --> 54:32.490
What do you know?

54:32.540 --> 54:36.940
That you've got a son you barely
see. Hardly holier than thou.

54:46.260 --> 54:48.570
You should have seen his face.

54:48.620 --> 54:51.090
He had no idea where I was
getting the ammunition.

54:51.140 --> 54:55.290
Happy to help. AC-12
aren't fit for purpose.

54:55.340 --> 54:57.690
You could go so far as to say corrupt.

54:57.740 --> 55:00.490
It's high time someone shut them down.

55:00.540 --> 55:02.330
I let their case play out.

55:02.380 --> 55:04.410
I thought it was worth
hearing everything they had,

55:04.460 --> 55:06.930
just in case there were any surprises.

55:06.980 --> 55:08.210
And were there?

55:08.260 --> 55:09.660
None I couldn't handle.

55:11.060 --> 55:13.050
My name didn't come up, at all?

55:13.100 --> 55:17.490
No, they've stopped accusing me of
succumbing to executive pressure.

55:17.540 --> 55:20.530
This is the most agreeable solution.

55:20.580 --> 55:22.770
Tim Ifield's peccadilloes
out of the public eye.

55:22.820 --> 55:24.530
Michael Farmer's crimes punished.

55:24.580 --> 55:25.890
You've done a great job, Roz.

55:25.940 --> 55:28.180
Thank you, sir, for backing me.

55:29.260 --> 55:30.500
What are friends for?

55:34.380 --> 55:37.690
Let's go up. Bring that with you.

55:37.740 --> 55:40.020
I'm sorry.

55:41.620 --> 55:46.060
I love my husband and I love my children.

55:49.100 --> 55:51.220
I won't betray their trust.

55:53.420 --> 55:55.460
It's a moral question.

55:57.260 --> 55:58.300
I'm sorry.

56:37.060 --> 56:38.460
Well done.

57:26.020 --> 57:27.060
Good news.

57:29.140 --> 57:31.500
No-one thinks you're a murderer any more.
