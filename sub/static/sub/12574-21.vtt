<i>Previously...on Legend
of the Seeker</i>

00:02.776 --> 00:04.577
<i>You have to take the Stone
of Tears</i>

00:04.578 --> 00:07.513
<i>to the Pillars of Creation on the
day of the summer solstice,</i>

00:07.692 --> 00:09.258
<i>and repair the tear in the veil.</i>

00:09.259 --> 00:12.229
What do you want?
The same as you, dear brother.

00:12.230 --> 00:13.597
To save the world.

00:13.598 --> 00:16.366
If you help me achieve
this victory for him,

00:16.367 --> 00:18.738
I have no doubt that the
Keeper will reward you

00:18.739 --> 00:21.509
beyond imagining.

00:21.510 --> 00:22.944
<i>Whoever gains possession</i>

00:22.945 --> 00:26.011
<i>of all three Boxes of Orden</i>
<i>will be unstoppable.</i>

00:26.012 --> 00:28.977
<i>She is pristinely ungifted.</i>

00:28.978 --> 00:33.077
Magic doesn't work on me.
Not evenen the magic of Orden.

00:33.078 --> 00:34.613
The true Lord Rahl is in danger.

00:34.614 --> 00:35.847
I need your help to save him.

00:35.848 --> 00:37.115
Do you think we can trust her?

00:37.116 --> 00:38.516
I've known her for a long time.

00:38.517 --> 00:41.987
You once swore to kill
the man you now serve.

00:41.988 --> 00:43.622
Why did you lie to me?

00:43.623 --> 00:45.858
I want you back on my side.

00:45.859 --> 00:49.694
<i>Fortunately, I knew of your special
friendship with Dahlia</i>

00:49.695 --> 00:52.530
<i>The Agiel's touch will be more
painful to her</i>

00:52.531 --> 00:54.632
<i>than all the fires of the Underworld.</i>

00:57.103 --> 00:58.670
Cara, why?

00:58.671 --> 01:00.471
I brought what you asked for.

01:04.441 --> 01:09.277
<i>Richard Cypher, you are the
true Seeker.</i>

01:25.930 --> 01:29.299
Rahl is taking the Stone
of Tears northeast.

01:29.300 --> 01:31.602
The Pillars of Creation
are to the south.

01:31.603 --> 01:33.837
Rahl isn't taking the
Stone to the Pillars.

01:33.838 --> 01:36.272
He has no intention of
using it to seal the veil.

01:36.273 --> 01:39.007
Then where's he taking it?

01:47.217 --> 01:49.952
Why are we stopping?

01:49.953 --> 01:55.121
Marianna, do you really fail to
grasp the import of the moment?

01:55.122 --> 01:58.091
We are about to deliver
the Stone of Tears

01:58.092 --> 02:00.059
to the Keeper.

02:00.060 --> 02:04.497
And once he has it, the tear in
the veil can never be sealed,

02:04.498 --> 02:06.699
and the World of the Living

02:06.700 --> 02:10.202
will fall forever into darkness.

02:10.203 --> 02:13.939
But before we proceed
into the rift,

02:13.940 --> 02:17.843
let us offer a prayer of
gratitude to our master

02:17.844 --> 02:21.045
for allowing us,
his humble servants,

02:21.046 --> 02:23.881
a small part to play

02:23.882 --> 02:27.017
in his glorious victory.

02:59.982 --> 03:01.716
You betrayed the Keeper.

03:10.491 --> 03:14.860
You have all done very well.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.094
Now, we should travel with haste.

03:17.095 --> 03:20.663
No doubt my intrepid brother
is already close behind.

03:20.664 --> 03:23.065
I can stop him, My Lord.

03:24.500 --> 03:25.834
Cara,

03:25.835 --> 03:29.471
your loyalty and
devotion are touching.

03:29.472 --> 03:32.672
But I'm afraid you are
no match for the Seeker.

03:32.673 --> 03:35.174
You're forgetting
Richard's weakness.

03:36.843 --> 03:39.278
Compassion.

03:39.279 --> 03:41.616
He still cares for me.

03:41.617 --> 03:45.653
When the moment comes,
he won't be able to finish me off.

03:47.622 --> 03:48.922
And that's when I'll kill him.

03:50.456 --> 03:52.489
The Wizard's power is
useless against you,

03:52.490 --> 03:54.457
but the Mother Confessor
is another story.

03:54.458 --> 03:58.594
Her touch is deadly to Mord-Sith.

03:58.595 --> 04:01.897
We're not afraid of the
Confessor, My Lord.

04:06.434 --> 04:07.701
The Seeker won't stop

04:07.702 --> 04:09.503
until he recovers the Stone.

04:09.504 --> 04:12.538
And he'll kill you to get it.

04:12.539 --> 04:14.807
Please.

04:14.808 --> 04:17.108
Let us do this for you.

04:29.021 --> 04:33.024
I am so glad you have
returned to our family, Cara.

05:01.184 --> 05:03.752
Cara, don't do this.

05:03.753 --> 05:05.553
You seem to have forgotten,
Richard.

05:05.554 --> 05:07.555
Mord-Sith only take orders

05:07.556 --> 05:11.156
from the true Lord Rahl.

05:25.003 --> 05:26.637
Zedd, no! She'll kill you!
Get out of here!

05:52.297 --> 05:55.132
Dahlia!

06:05.641 --> 06:08.010
The compass is useless.

06:08.011 --> 06:09.311
Dahlia.

06:09.312 --> 06:11.713
Dahlia, you don't
have long to live.

06:11.714 --> 06:15.982
If you're going to serve me,
you have to do it now.

06:15.983 --> 06:19.083
Tell me where Rahl
is taking the Stone.

06:20.350 --> 06:23.182
I'm sorry, mistress.

06:23.183 --> 06:25.482
I don't know.

06:27.448 --> 06:30.550
I beg of you,

06:30.551 --> 06:32.485
forgive me.

06:38.925 --> 06:41.326
Without the compass,
we might not find Rahl

06:41.327 --> 06:43.895
or the Stone before the solstice.

06:45.965 --> 06:48.765
Maybe Cara knows where he is.

06:48.766 --> 06:53.268
But I'd have to confess
her to find out.

06:53.269 --> 06:56.971
You know what you
need to do, Richard.

06:56.972 --> 07:01.341
But we both know you don't
have the stomach for it.

07:11.517 --> 07:15.185
She is in the grip of
an insidious magic,

07:15.186 --> 07:18.688
as dark as any I've felt before.

07:18.689 --> 07:21.190
That's how Rahl
turned her against us.

07:21.191 --> 07:25.661
Lord Rahl merely showed
me the error of my ways.

07:25.662 --> 07:28.864
I was a fool to ever follow you.

07:36.707 --> 07:38.307
We may have to accept the fact

07:38.308 --> 07:41.943
that the Cara we
know is gone forever.

07:41.944 --> 07:43.978
I don't believe that.

07:43.979 --> 07:47.381
There has to be a way of undoing
whatever it was Rahl did to her.

07:47.382 --> 07:49.083
There is one way,

07:49.084 --> 07:51.217
but the results are unpredictable.

07:52.753 --> 07:55.988
It's a spell I learned years
ago in the Wizard's Keep,

07:55.989 --> 07:58.723
but I've never dared use it.

07:58.724 --> 08:00.357
It's called the Spell of Undoing.

08:00.358 --> 08:02.927
According to the ancient texts,

08:02.928 --> 08:07.164
it can erase even the most
pernicious forms of dark magic.

08:07.165 --> 08:09.132
Do it.

08:09.133 --> 08:11.301
Richard, this spell hasn't
been invoked in ages,

08:11.302 --> 08:13.870
and for very good reason.

08:13.871 --> 08:17.273
It could undo the magic
Darken Rahl inflicted on Cara,

08:17.274 --> 08:19.641
but it could also
affect her in ways

08:19.642 --> 08:22.743
I couldn't even begin to predict.

08:22.744 --> 08:25.512
It could even kill her.

08:25.513 --> 08:28.815
And if it does,
we may lose any hope

08:28.816 --> 08:30.817
of finding Rahl and
the Stone in time.

08:32.152 --> 08:34.253
Cara's had everything
taken away from her.

08:34.254 --> 08:36.321
Twice.

08:36.322 --> 08:39.123
She would've gone to the
ends of the world for me.

08:39.124 --> 08:41.457
I'm not giving up on her now.

09:56.085 --> 09:58.885
Zedd. Is everything all right?

09:58.886 --> 10:01.054
Richard?

10:05.024 --> 10:07.058
Everyone's waiting.

10:09.561 --> 10:11.961
This is the People's Palace.

10:11.962 --> 10:13.997
What are we doing here?

10:13.998 --> 10:17.536
I think Zedd's gotten
into the ambrosia

10:17.537 --> 10:19.973
a little early.

10:19.974 --> 10:21.042
Grandfather.

10:23.081 --> 10:26.153
The ring.

10:28.189 --> 10:29.756
It's in your left sleeve.

10:50.008 --> 10:53.475
With this ring, I bind my soul,

10:53.476 --> 10:57.178
mind and body

10:57.179 --> 11:00.181
with yours.

11:00.182 --> 11:02.383
In the eyes of the Creator,

11:02.384 --> 11:06.653
you are now joined
as husband and wife.

11:06.654 --> 11:11.490
For all eternity,
you will be as one.

11:45.072 --> 11:46.039
Richard.

11:48.675 --> 11:50.910
I need to speak
with the two of you.

11:51.605 --> 11:53.272
Alone.

11:57.608 --> 12:00.577
Zedd, you know anything
you can say to me

12:00.578 --> 12:02.311
you can say in front of my brother.

12:02.312 --> 12:04.380
It's quite all right, Richard.

12:04.381 --> 12:08.250
I seem to be making
Zeddicus uncomfortable.

12:08.251 --> 12:10.685
I shall attend to your guests.

12:10.686 --> 12:12.687
Please.

12:14.756 --> 12:19.159
Zedd, what's wrong?

12:19.160 --> 12:20.193
What's wrong?

12:21.762 --> 12:23.696
Five minutes ago,
we were standing in a forest

12:23.697 --> 12:25.264
a thousand leagues from here,

12:25.265 --> 12:28.500
and now suddenly we're
in the People's Palace.

12:28.501 --> 12:29.567
And where's Cara?

12:29.568 --> 12:30.802
Who's Cara?

12:32.271 --> 12:33.704
Sharp tongue, red leather,

12:33.705 --> 12:35.139
carries two Agiels.

12:35.140 --> 12:36.607
A Mord-Sith.

12:36.608 --> 12:38.909
She's been traveling with
us for nearly a year.

12:42.246 --> 12:43.413
Zedd,

12:43.414 --> 12:45.615
you and I have been
at the People's Palace

12:45.616 --> 12:47.683
for the past year,

12:47.684 --> 12:51.253
and Kahlan's been in Aydindril,
restoring the rule of law.

12:51.254 --> 12:53.321
Maybe someone spelled your memory.

12:53.322 --> 12:56.491
No one spelled my memory.

12:56.492 --> 13:00.160
I cast a spell on Cara.

13:00.161 --> 13:03.363
But the spell seems to
have changed everything.

13:03.364 --> 13:05.998
What changes?

13:05.999 --> 13:07.599
Well, we weren't at
the People's Palace,

13:07.600 --> 13:10.201
We were on a quest to
find the Stone of Tears.

13:10.202 --> 13:13.905
Why would we be looking
for the Stone of Tears?

13:15.540 --> 13:17.508
We need it to repair the veil

13:17.509 --> 13:20.009
between the Underworld and
the Land of the Living.

13:20.010 --> 13:24.514
It was torn when the Boxes of
Orden were destroyed a year ago.

13:26.216 --> 13:28.617
The Boxes.

13:28.618 --> 13:30.318
They're intact.

13:30.319 --> 13:32.486
I put them together
almost a year ago,

13:32.487 --> 13:34.521
on that cliff in West Granthia.

13:36.790 --> 13:39.759
Then you have the Power of Orden.

13:42.596 --> 13:44.496
That's why Rahl is
no threat to you.

13:44.497 --> 13:47.365
You bent him to your will.

13:48.767 --> 13:50.634
Do you control everyone?

13:50.635 --> 13:53.236
No, only those who
were a threat to me.

13:53.237 --> 13:56.538
Rahl, the Mord-Sith,
the Third Battalion.

13:56.539 --> 13:58.540
It was just as you predicted, Zedd.

13:58.541 --> 14:01.675
Orden was tempered by
my Confessor's touch.

14:01.676 --> 14:06.746
So Richard has been able to use
his power wisely and justly.

14:06.747 --> 14:09.816
And Orden, in turn,

14:09.817 --> 14:12.351
tempered confession.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.486
So Kahlan and I can be together.

14:16.255 --> 14:20.591
From my perspective,
none of this happened.

14:20.592 --> 14:22.759
Well, maybe if you tell
us how you remember it,

14:22.760 --> 14:24.094
we can figure out what's going on.

14:24.095 --> 14:27.030
I remember West Granthia.

14:27.031 --> 14:28.898
You put the Boxes together.

14:28.899 --> 14:32.234
But we were attacked
by the Mord-Sith.

14:32.235 --> 14:35.237
<i>Cara led the assault.</i>

14:37.340 --> 14:39.007
No!

14:39.008 --> 14:42.076
<i>But at the last moment,
she betrayed her sisters.</i>

14:48.413 --> 14:51.317
No!

14:51.318 --> 14:53.652
<i>Rahl grabbed the Sword of Truth...</i>

14:56.223 --> 14:59.958
<i>and used it to split the Boxes apart.</i>

15:04.297 --> 15:08.633
And Rahl and the
Boxes were destroyed.

15:08.634 --> 15:09.901
Zedd,

15:09.902 --> 15:12.366
there was no Mord-Sith
who betrayed her sisters.

15:12.367 --> 15:15.135
And the Boxes obviously
didn't explode.

15:15.136 --> 15:19.604
<i>Kahlan confessed me the moment
I assembled them.</i>

15:26.546 --> 15:29.314
<i>Rahl did try to stop us,</i>

15:29.315 --> 15:31.048
<i>but he was too late.</i>

15:31.049 --> 15:32.216
No!

15:36.787 --> 15:38.354
Stop.

15:42.525 --> 15:43.692
Drop your weapons.

15:46.662 --> 15:48.129
On your knees, all of you.

15:48.130 --> 15:49.965
Yes, My Lord.

15:57.272 --> 15:58.506
Richard, you've done it.

16:03.811 --> 16:06.912
Why would the absence
of one Mord-Sith

16:06.913 --> 16:08.447
make such a difference?

16:08.448 --> 16:13.284
Cara was Darken Rahl's most able
and trusted Sister of the Agiel.

16:13.285 --> 16:16.053
Maybe without her
to lead the attack,

16:16.054 --> 16:17.487
they couldn't find us in time.

16:17.488 --> 16:20.256
That would have given you
the extra moments you needed

16:20.257 --> 16:21.524
to acquire the Power of Orden.

16:21.525 --> 16:24.326
So then what happened
with this Cara?

16:26.396 --> 16:28.496
The spell I cast
may have killed her

16:28.497 --> 16:31.966
or erased her from
existence itself.

16:31.967 --> 16:34.735
If this spell was as
powerful as it seems,

16:34.736 --> 16:36.970
maybe it didn't kill her.

16:36.971 --> 16:39.572
Maybe it just undid all
the Mord-Sith magic

16:39.573 --> 16:41.140
that was ever inflicted on her.

16:41.141 --> 16:44.342
Then it wouldn't be just
Rahl's sorcery that was undone,

16:44.343 --> 16:47.478
but the magic used to
break her as a child.

16:47.479 --> 16:49.613
She never would have
become a Mord-Sith at all.

16:49.614 --> 16:51.782
She wouldn't have been on the
cliff that night to attack.

16:51.783 --> 16:54.884
Then if Cara's not dead
and she's not Mord-Sith,

16:54.885 --> 16:56.519
then where is she?

16:56.520 --> 16:58.721
Sorry to bother you, Richard.

16:58.722 --> 17:01.090
But your guests are asking for you.

17:01.091 --> 17:02.224
We'll be right there.

17:02.225 --> 17:03.659
I want you to do something for me.

17:03.660 --> 17:05.194
Anything.

17:05.194 --> 17:06.962
I need you to find a young woman.

17:12.634 --> 17:15.569
Her name is Cara Mason.

17:15.569 --> 17:18.872
She would have been born in
the village of Stowecroft,

17:18.873 --> 17:21.507
25, 26 summers ago.

17:21.508 --> 17:24.076
I will send a rider to find
out if she still lives there,

17:24.077 --> 17:27.612
and if not,
where she might have gone.

17:31.317 --> 17:32.317
Richard,

17:33.751 --> 17:35.251
I realize with the Power of Orden

17:35.252 --> 17:37.220
you can make Rahl do
whatever you want,

17:37.221 --> 17:40.522
but are you sure it wouldn't
have been more prudent

17:40.523 --> 17:42.424
for you to kill him as
the Prophecy foretold?

17:42.425 --> 17:45.026
Zedd, you know I don't
believe in Prophecy.

17:45.027 --> 17:48.496
And as you can see, my brother
is more useful to me alive.

17:48.497 --> 17:51.032
He's a trusted advisor
and a close friend.

17:51.033 --> 17:52.667
Friend?

17:52.668 --> 17:55.836
He's not the same man he was
before I used my power on him.

17:55.837 --> 17:57.838
It's a new day in D'Hara, Zedd.

17:57.839 --> 18:01.908
I want people to know their
ruler isn't vengeful or cruel,

18:01.909 --> 18:04.443
that I believe
everyone can do good.

18:04.444 --> 18:08.113
I admire your generosity, Richard,

18:08.114 --> 18:10.882
but the spell may
have affected history

18:10.883 --> 18:14.017
in ways we haven't discovered yet.

18:14.018 --> 18:16.586
And there will be plenty
of time to look into that.

18:16.587 --> 18:17.720
But we' at a wedding.

18:17.721 --> 18:19.922
Enjoy the party.

18:19.923 --> 18:23.692
It's time for me to dance
with my lovely wife.

18:32.567 --> 18:35.101
( <i>ominous theme playing</i>

18:49.148 --> 18:52.116
<i>Sister Marianna.</i>

18:52.117 --> 18:54.651
<i>Kneel before the Keeper.</i>

18:56.554 --> 19:00.255
<i>The time has come for you to serve me.</i>

19:00.256 --> 19:03.391
I've been waiting for this
moment all my life, master.

19:03.392 --> 19:06.494
<i>Something has happened beyond
your reckoning.</i>

19:06.495 --> 19:08.596
<i>The world has changed.</i>

19:08.597 --> 19:11.135
<i>Victory has been stolen from my grasp.</i>

19:11.136 --> 19:13.405
I don't understand, master.

19:13.406 --> 19:15.173
What victory do you speak of?

19:15.174 --> 19:16.942
<i>The veil was torn.</i>

19:16.943 --> 19:20.979
<i>My minions were waging war on
the Land of the Living.</i>

19:20.980 --> 19:22.981
<i>But somehow the First Wizard</i>

19:22.982 --> 19:26.217
<i>has restored harmony between
death and life.</i>

19:26.218 --> 19:29.153
<i>You must upset the balance once again.</i>

19:29.154 --> 19:32.356
Tell me what I must do.

19:32.357 --> 19:34.024
<i>Leave the Palace of
the Prophets at once</i>

19:34.025 --> 19:36.292
<i>and find the sister of the Seeker,</i>

19:36.293 --> 19:40.093
<i>the pristinely ungifted one,
Jennsen Rahl.</i>

19:40.094 --> 19:43.896
will find her, Keeper,
but how will this serve you?

19:43.897 --> 19:46.363
<i>Her blood is the key.</i>

19:46.364 --> 19:48.864
<i>It will allow you to do</i>
<i>what must be done</i>

19:48.865 --> 19:50.798
<i>in order to tear the veil again</i>

19:50.799 --> 19:54.837
<i>and ensure my victory over life.</i>

20:12.043 --> 20:13.577
Good morning, Your Highness.

20:15.846 --> 20:17.680
I don't think I'm ever
going to get used to that.

20:17.681 --> 20:19.848
You should try "Lord Rahl".

20:19.849 --> 20:21.683
Mm.

20:26.121 --> 20:28.489
I can think of something
more appropriate.

20:30.558 --> 20:31.725
How about "dad"?

20:31.726 --> 20:32.926
What?

20:35.896 --> 20:38.197
It's only been three days.
How could you know?

20:38.198 --> 20:40.933
A Confessor knows.

20:51.876 --> 20:54.677
I didn't think it was
possible to be this happy.

21:04.019 --> 21:05.953
Zedd. Zedd.

21:05.954 --> 21:08.355
Perfect timing, as usual.

21:20.200 --> 21:21.434
Jennsen.

21:21.435 --> 21:25.937
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I just got word.

21:25.938 --> 21:28.005
My friend Sean.

21:28.006 --> 21:29.807
He passed away.

21:29.808 --> 21:32.009
Oh, I'm so sorry, Jennsen.

21:32.010 --> 21:35.912
Sean's last wish was that I
take care of his daughter.

21:35.913 --> 21:38.714
I'd like to bring Eryn here
to live with us at the Palace.

21:38.715 --> 21:41.417
Of course. I'll go with you.
We'll bring her back together.

21:41.418 --> 21:44.853
Richard, you just got married.

21:44.854 --> 21:47.118
And you have an empire
to take care of.

21:47.119 --> 21:49.820
I'll be fine.

21:49.821 --> 21:51.421
I'll send Commander
Trimack with you.

21:57.361 --> 21:59.395
I've inspected the palace defenses

21:59.396 --> 22:00.863
and found them woefully inadequate.

22:00.864 --> 22:02.231
With your permission,

22:02.232 --> 22:03.966
I'd like to strengthen
the magical barriers

22:03.967 --> 22:05.000
around the perimeter.

22:05.001 --> 22:07.202
Zedd, I have the Power of Orden.

22:07.203 --> 22:09.003
I don't think anyone's
planning to attack us.

22:09.004 --> 22:10.638
For all we know,
there are people out there

22:10.639 --> 22:11.973
who still mean you harm.

22:11.974 --> 22:13.408
Well, if it makes you feel better,

22:13.409 --> 22:15.910
go ahead, fortify the barriers.

22:17.380 --> 22:19.848
I realize this may seem
like a waste of time

22:19.849 --> 22:21.182
to someone with your power,

22:21.183 --> 22:24.218
but there's an ache
in my bones, my boy.

22:24.219 --> 22:26.854
Something is wrong here.

22:26.855 --> 22:29.456
The world is not
supposed to be like this.

22:29.457 --> 22:33.827
Zedd, the world you told us about,

22:33.828 --> 22:36.228
with the rifts opening everywhere

22:36.229 --> 22:37.796
and the Keeper on the
verge of winning?

22:37.797 --> 22:41.266
Maybe that's the world that
should never have been.

22:41.267 --> 22:42.834
Life's good now.

22:42.835 --> 22:45.471
Maybe when you cast that spell,

22:45.472 --> 22:48.143
you put things back the way
they're supposed to be.

22:51.246 --> 22:54.247
Richard, our rider has
returned from Stowecroft.

22:54.248 --> 22:57.815
There is indeed a young woman
named Cara Mason living there.

22:57.816 --> 22:58.883
She's a schoolteacher

22:58.884 --> 23:01.017
and a mother of two young children.

23:01.018 --> 23:02.685
She's also a widow.

23:02.686 --> 23:04.153
She lost her husband
during the war.

23:04.154 --> 23:08.923
Zedd, I'm sorry about her husband,

23:08.924 --> 23:10.324
but from what you told us

23:10.325 --> 23:13.560
Cara was broken not
just once but twice.

23:13.561 --> 23:17.062
It sounds like she has a
better life in this world

23:17.063 --> 23:18.430
than she did in the other one.

23:24.369 --> 23:25.603
Sam.

23:25.604 --> 23:28.072
Play nicely with your
sister or you can go inside.

23:28.073 --> 23:30.574
Excuse me, ma'am?

23:30.575 --> 23:31.608
Hey.

23:37.412 --> 23:39.546
You really shouldn't sneak
up on someone like that.

23:39.547 --> 23:41.481
I didn't mean to startle you.
I'm sorry.

23:43.350 --> 23:45.383
My name is Leo Dane.
I'm just passing through

23:45.384 --> 23:47.185
on my way home to Archer's Peak.

23:47.186 --> 23:48.653
I was wondering if
you had some chores

23:48.654 --> 23:49.687
that might need doing.

23:49.688 --> 23:51.455
I'm a skilled blacksmith.

23:51.456 --> 23:54.057
I can also do carpentry.

23:54.058 --> 23:57.761
Thank you, but I can't
afford to hire any help.

23:57.762 --> 23:59.629
Sam, go inside.

23:59.630 --> 24:02.799
Now.

24:02.800 --> 24:05.869
On my way up the path,
I noticed your horse was favoring a leg.

24:05.870 --> 24:08.471
He sprung a heel.

24:08.472 --> 24:10.572
If you don't re-shoe him,
he'll go lame.

24:10.573 --> 24:13.874
I'd be happy to take
care of it for you.

24:13.875 --> 24:15.542
You don't have to pay me.

24:18.646 --> 24:20.947
Well, if you're going
to shoe the horse,

24:20.948 --> 24:23.949
I suppose the least I can
do is offer you a meal.

24:25.651 --> 24:27.018
Sounds like a fair trade.

24:49.940 --> 24:52.308
Jennsen!

24:52.309 --> 24:53.576
Help me!

25:03.787 --> 25:06.089
Jennsen!

25:11.328 --> 25:13.863
Where have they taken Jennsen?

25:13.864 --> 25:16.097
I'll tell you nothing.

25:16.098 --> 25:19.698
You will tell Lord Rahl.

25:19.699 --> 25:22.663
Tell me where they've
taken Jennsen.

25:22.664 --> 25:25.998
To the Caves of Andros, My Lord.

25:25.999 --> 25:28.233
Why?

25:28.234 --> 25:29.701
What do they want with her?

25:29.702 --> 25:32.736
Forgive me, My Lord, I don't know.

25:38.375 --> 25:40.975
This is exactly the sort of thing

25:40.976 --> 25:42.376
I was afraid would happen.

25:42.377 --> 25:44.813
The Keeper exists
outside time and place.

25:44.814 --> 25:46.549
He must be aware that
the world has changed.

25:46.550 --> 25:50.619
The Sisters of the Dark could
be using Jennsen somehow

25:50.620 --> 25:52.887
to re-establish his dominion.

25:52.888 --> 25:55.189
I'm going to find her.

25:55.190 --> 25:56.357
You're not going alone.

25:56.358 --> 25:59.292
She's my sister as well.

25:59.293 --> 26:00.526
Richard, this could be a trap.

26:00.527 --> 26:01.994
These Sisters of the Dark

26:01.995 --> 26:04.796
are subject to Orden
just like anyone else.

26:04.797 --> 26:06.798
And they can't use their
magic against Mord-Sith.

26:06.799 --> 26:08.867
I'll take some of them with us.

26:08.868 --> 26:10.202
You'll take me too.

26:10.203 --> 26:11.436
No, Zedd.

26:11.437 --> 26:13.104
I need you to stay here
and look after Kahlan.

26:15.373 --> 26:19.976
She's my wife now and
she's with child.

26:19.977 --> 26:23.312
I'm depending on you.

26:27.417 --> 26:29.117
I'll be back soon.

26:43.397 --> 26:46.599
Whatever you're doing,
it won't work.

26:46.600 --> 26:47.800
My brother will come for you.

26:49.569 --> 26:50.803
I'm planning on it.

26:56.910 --> 27:01.581
Sister, our han is the Keeper's
most sacred gift to us.

27:01.582 --> 27:06.553
If we drink this serum,
we'll lose our powers forever.

27:06.554 --> 27:09.255
Yes, but the blood of the
pristinely ungifted one

27:09.256 --> 27:11.358
will also make us immune
to all forms of magic,

27:11.359 --> 27:15.562
including the barriers
protecting the People's Palace.

27:15.563 --> 27:19.332
Our han is a small sacrifice to pay

27:19.333 --> 27:20.867
to ensure the Keeper's victory.

27:22.436 --> 27:24.870
Drink.

27:39.718 --> 27:41.785
The three of us will
infiltrate the Palace

27:41.786 --> 27:44.218
and separate the Boxes of Orden.

27:44.219 --> 27:48.320
The rest of you will wait here
for Richard Rahl to arrive

27:48.321 --> 27:50.422
and when the magic of
Orden has left him,

27:50.423 --> 27:52.823
you will kill him.

27:52.824 --> 27:57.260
Once we have acquired the
Boxes and the Sword of Truth,

27:57.261 --> 27:59.763
we will be able to deliver
the Keeper a great victory.

27:59.764 --> 28:01.463
And the pristinely ungifted one?

28:02.832 --> 28:04.332
What should we do with her?

28:04.333 --> 28:07.068
She's of no further use to us.

28:07.069 --> 28:08.904
Let her die.

28:27.547 --> 28:28.614
Richard.

28:31.287 --> 28:32.754
Give her the Breath of Life.

28:32.755 --> 28:34.120
She's been cold for too long.

28:34.121 --> 28:36.420
Even the most skilled Mord-Sith
couldn't bring her back.

28:36.421 --> 28:38.521
Do it anyway!

28:44.998 --> 28:47.601
Once we've passed
through the barrier,

28:47.602 --> 28:49.770
we'll head for the south entrance.

28:49.771 --> 28:52.271
You sure the serum will protect us?

28:52.272 --> 28:54.440
Don't worry, sister.

28:54.441 --> 28:56.342
If if fails you'll meet the Keeper

28:56.343 --> 28:58.577
sooner than you had ever hoped.

29:21.428 --> 29:22.594
What is it?

29:22.595 --> 29:25.064
We're not alone in here.

29:31.636 --> 29:33.668
Show yourselves.

30:21.506 --> 30:24.140
Long live Darken Rahl!

30:31.148 --> 30:33.949
Why did this man attack you?

30:33.950 --> 30:35.216
He's with the Third Battalion.

30:35.217 --> 30:38.418
They refused to accept Richard
as the legitimate heir.

30:38.419 --> 30:41.587
He used Orden to
force them to submit

30:41.588 --> 30:45.357
The Boxes. They're gone.

30:45.358 --> 30:49.560
If Richard no longer
has the Power of Orden,

30:49.561 --> 30:51.929
then the Mord-Sith and Darken Rahl

30:51.930 --> 30:53.730
are no longer under his control.

31:06.475 --> 31:07.575
Thank you.

31:07.576 --> 31:09.743
It's no trouble at all, brother.

31:30.599 --> 31:33.300
I want him alive.

31:40.041 --> 31:41.875
This was no happy
coincidence, was it?

31:41.876 --> 31:43.911
You and your Sisters lying
in wait for my brother,

31:43.912 --> 31:45.545
waiting for the precise moment

31:45.546 --> 31:47.981
when he was deprived
of the Power of Orden.

31:49.650 --> 31:51.551
No doubt you are working
with whoever it was

31:51.552 --> 31:55.386
who separated the Boxes.
I want to know where they are.

31:55.387 --> 31:57.588
You'll learn nothing from me.

31:57.589 --> 32:02.125
It's been some time since
I last wielded an Agiel,

32:02.126 --> 32:04.260
but I believe I still
have the talent for it.

32:04.261 --> 32:06.465
Answer me.

32:06.466 --> 32:09.800
Where are the Boxes of Orden?

32:17.140 --> 32:18.339
Looking for this?

32:20.675 --> 32:21.908
Give me the Sword.

32:21.909 --> 32:25.278
I had a little talk with
one of your Sisters.

32:25.279 --> 32:27.546
I know what you're planning.

32:27.547 --> 32:31.183
This Sword is the only weapon
in all Creation powerful enough

32:31.184 --> 32:33.853
to destroy the Boxes of Orden.

32:33.854 --> 32:37.593
And if they are destroyed,
the veil will be torn,

32:37.594 --> 32:40.695
and the Keeper will be
able to send his minions

32:40.696 --> 32:42.563
into the World of the Living.

32:42.564 --> 32:43.830
Give us the Sword

32:43.831 --> 32:47.333
and the Keeper will reward
you for your devotion.

32:49.235 --> 32:52.537
I can imagine a far greater reward.

32:52.538 --> 32:54.872
The Boxes, if you please.

32:54.873 --> 32:56.570
Kill him.

33:00.105 --> 33:02.273
Behind you.

33:14.416 --> 33:16.180
Bring him.

33:19.851 --> 33:22.617
You bent me to your will.

33:22.618 --> 33:25.350
Now I shall bend you to mine.

33:25.351 --> 33:28.483
No!

34:00.279 --> 34:01.379
Kneel before me.

34:02.914 --> 34:05.148
Yes, My Lord.

34:17.396 --> 34:18.563
Your Highness, the Third Battalion

34:18.565 --> 34:20.264
is trying to take the palace.

34:20.929 --> 34:22.328
It's not safe for you here.

34:22.329 --> 34:26.362
I want you and three
of your most loyal men,

34:26.362 --> 34:29.429
soldiers not controlled by Orden.

34:29.431 --> 34:32.996
We're going to find my husband.

34:45.241 --> 34:47.375
It's worse than I imagined.

34:47.376 --> 34:50.175
Rahl has the Boxes, the Sword,
and the Power of Orden.

34:50.176 --> 34:53.643
He's controlling Richard.

34:53.645 --> 34:54.777
We have to free him.

34:54.779 --> 34:57.546
The only way to do
that is to kill Rahl,

34:57.547 --> 34:59.680
but I can't blast him
with Wizard's Fire,

34:59.681 --> 35:02.249
the Mord-Sith will deflect it.

35:02.250 --> 35:04.050
And if Rahl so much as sees us,

35:04.051 --> 35:06.853
he'll bend us to his will just
as surely as he did Richard.

35:06.854 --> 35:09.891
Oh, Zedd. We have to do something.

35:09.892 --> 35:13.997
There is one thing I can try,

35:13.998 --> 35:17.133
but you're not going to like it.

35:17.134 --> 35:19.802
I can try to reverse
the Spell of Undoing.

35:19.803 --> 35:21.536
Put the world back the way it was.

35:21.537 --> 35:25.006
Zedd, I know things are bad, but...

35:25.007 --> 35:27.107
do you really want to
go back to an existence

35:27.108 --> 35:30.176
where the dead walk
among the living?

35:30.177 --> 35:32.645
The Keeper is on the
brink of victory.

35:32.646 --> 35:35.748
Even in this world the
Keeper is bent on destroying

35:35.749 --> 35:36.915
the Land of the Living.

35:36.916 --> 35:38.816
And he is not going to stop.

35:38.817 --> 35:41.519
And with Richard enslaved to Rahl,

35:41.520 --> 35:42.921
how will we defeat the Keeper?

35:42.922 --> 35:46.490
At least in the other world
we had Richard on our side

35:46.491 --> 35:50.892
and with Richard we still
had a fighting chance.

35:52.261 --> 35:53.327
And our child?

35:57.131 --> 35:59.598
What kind of a life would
she have in a world

35:59.599 --> 36:02.334
where her parents are
enslaved to Darken Rahl?

36:04.403 --> 36:07.507
Kahlan, I know this isn't easy.

36:07.508 --> 36:09.843
I know how much you
want to be with Richard,

36:09.844 --> 36:12.812
but your life
together here is over.

36:12.813 --> 36:14.980
If you truly want to save him,

36:14.981 --> 36:17.349
we have to try to put things back.

36:17.350 --> 36:20.988
Richard may not be your
husband in the other world,

36:20.989 --> 36:23.757
but he still loves you dearly.

36:28.897 --> 36:31.696
What do you need to
reverse the spell?

36:32.931 --> 36:36.266
We have to find Cara

36:36.267 --> 36:38.801
and pray that Darken Rahl
doesn't get to her first.

36:54.183 --> 36:57.418
We've searched everywhere, My Lord.

36:57.419 --> 36:59.152
Kahlan and the First
Wizard must have fled.

36:59.153 --> 37:00.720
No doubt they learned

37:00.721 --> 37:04.589
I was taking up residence
in the palace again.

37:06.358 --> 37:10.494
If the Sisters of the
Dark are to be believed,

37:10.495 --> 37:12.161
then the Keeper is convinced

37:12.162 --> 37:14.663
that your Wizard cast a spell
that changed the world.

37:14.664 --> 37:15.697
What do you know of this?

37:15.698 --> 37:18.466
Zedd cast the spell on Cara Mason,

37:18.467 --> 37:20.969
the woman I asked you
to find in Stowecroft.

37:20.970 --> 37:24.872
Perhaps Zeddicus decided
the world he came from

37:24.873 --> 37:28.174
is preferable to one in which I
rule with the magic of Orden.

37:28.175 --> 37:33.111
He may try to undo what
was done to this Cara.

37:33.112 --> 37:34.245
Get me a Journey Book.

37:34.246 --> 37:35.579
Yes, My Lord.

37:39.516 --> 37:41.649
Mistress Dahlia. What is it?

37:41.650 --> 37:44.551
Orders from the People's Palace.

37:44.552 --> 37:47.487
We're to proceed to
Stowecroft right away.

37:47.488 --> 37:50.490
We're to find a schoolteacher.

37:50.491 --> 37:52.558
Her name is Cara.

37:52.559 --> 37:56.463
Cara Mason? You know her?

37:59.166 --> 38:02.167
A long time ago,
when we were children,

38:02.168 --> 38:06.305
before I joined my true family.

38:10.643 --> 38:14.547
What else does it say, mistress?

38:14.548 --> 38:17.184
Our orders are to kill her.

38:25.455 --> 38:27.089
I've fixed the hole in the roof,

38:27.090 --> 38:29.925
painted the window trim,
swept the chimney,

38:29.926 --> 38:34.594
and, uh, chopped enough
firewood to last two winters.

38:34.595 --> 38:37.596
Anyone ever tell you
you're a real taskmaster?

38:39.932 --> 38:42.466
I suppose you'll be moving on now.

38:42.467 --> 38:44.268
I guess so.

38:46.303 --> 38:48.671
Do you know where
you're going next?

38:51.440 --> 38:53.641
Uh, Rivermore is a
few leagues west,

38:53.642 --> 38:56.845
I'll look for work there.

38:56.846 --> 38:58.413
I'm sure you'll find someone there

38:58.414 --> 39:01.682
who'll be grateful for your help.

39:05.319 --> 39:07.419
I picked these for you.

39:09.724 --> 39:11.325
They match your dress.

39:24.071 --> 39:26.239
Ugh. I'm sorry.

39:26.240 --> 39:28.775
Flowers make me sneeze.
I didn't realize.

39:28.776 --> 39:30.310
I should have got
you something else.

39:30.311 --> 39:35.248
No. No, they're-
They're beautiful.

39:35.249 --> 39:39.251
Where's Sofia and Sam?
I made them some toys.

39:40.954 --> 39:44.424
My sister took them for the-
The afternoon.

39:44.425 --> 39:46.959
I don't want to leave
without saying goodbye.

39:46.960 --> 39:50.529
Well, if you're going
to stay longer,

39:50.530 --> 39:54.566
I-I suppose I can
find something else

39:54.567 --> 39:56.401
for you to do.

40:13.151 --> 40:14.819
I don't believe it.

40:14.820 --> 40:16.287
Leo Dane.

40:16.288 --> 40:17.355
You know him?

40:17.356 --> 40:20.460
For a brief time,
he was the Seeker.

40:20.461 --> 40:23.529
What? It's a long story.

40:23.530 --> 40:26.864
Cara and Leo fell in love,
but he was killed.

40:29.134 --> 40:32.071
Fate is a mysterious force, Kahlan.

40:32.072 --> 40:35.242
It brought Cara and Leo
together again in this world.

40:35.243 --> 40:39.779
But when you reverse the spell
and make Cara a Mord-Sith,

40:39.780 --> 40:42.849
he'll be dead again?

40:42.850 --> 40:44.684
Mm-hm.

40:44.685 --> 40:47.487
Zedd, this is wrong.

40:47.488 --> 40:50.089
These people haven't
done anything to anyone.

40:50.090 --> 40:53.358
I wish there was another way,
but there isn't.

40:53.359 --> 40:57.562
And the Cara I know would give
up this life in a heartbeat

40:57.563 --> 41:01.101
if she knew that in doing
so she'd be saving Richard.

41:13.113 --> 41:15.781
I need to remove the Wizard's web

41:15.782 --> 41:18.283
in order to reverse the spell.

41:23.188 --> 41:24.755
Who are you?

41:24.756 --> 41:27.424
What are you doing to me?

41:27.425 --> 41:29.092
Try and stay calm.

41:29.093 --> 41:33.028
You're-- You're the
Mother Confessor,

41:33.029 --> 41:34.863
aren't you?

41:34.864 --> 41:36.131
Yes.

41:36.132 --> 41:38.166
Please, let me go.

41:39.902 --> 41:42.103
I'm sorry, we can't.

41:47.141 --> 41:50.983
I have a son and a daughter.

41:50.984 --> 41:53.118
I'm all they have left.

42:02.761 --> 42:04.796
I'll do anything you want,
please let me go!

42:14.837 --> 42:16.672
Zedd!

42:20.745 --> 42:22.645
Dahlia.

42:22.646 --> 42:24.413
I don't believe I've
had the pleasure.

42:24.414 --> 42:26.448
She's dead.

42:26.449 --> 42:29.150
Why the worried faces?

42:29.151 --> 42:33.188
I'm taking you home to
the People's Palace.

42:33.189 --> 42:34.956
There, you'll get to experience

42:34.957 --> 42:36.824
the Power of Orden for yourselves,

42:36.825 --> 42:41.760
and then you'll only have
one care in the world:

42:41.761 --> 42:44.961
serving your new master,

42:44.962 --> 42:47.430
Lord Darken Rahl.
