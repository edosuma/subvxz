02:29.662 --> 02:32.989
Alright, I had planned on taking
a walk around the garden

02:32.890 --> 02:34.458
and showing you the lake.

02:35.173 --> 02:38.310
Really Clive, I don't expect
you to control the weather.

02:39.804 --> 02:43.213
- Still, we can make much of it.
- Indeed.

02:46.932 --> 02:49.593
Let's just see
what's been prepared.

02:51.366 --> 02:53.600
- Lemonade.
- Marvelous.

02:53.835 --> 02:55.680
- Glass?
- Please.

03:10.250 --> 03:13.606
You really are
quite beautiful, June.

03:14.367 --> 03:17.949
And you really are
quite a charmer, Clive.

03:25.474 --> 03:28.797
The lemons were freshly squeezed
this morning by by my staff.

03:28.798 --> 03:30.050
- Really?
- Yes.

03:30.385 --> 03:34.417
- Excuse me, Mr. Willis?
- Yes, Jack?

03:34.452 --> 03:36.624
Can I get some of
your lemonade, please?

03:37.225 --> 03:39.648
No, you certainly may not.

03:39.649 --> 03:43.254
It's become improper, Jack.
Back to your chores.

03:44.923 --> 03:47.739
Smart even,
I never knew this quite.

03:47.740 --> 03:48.805
More.

03:53.289 --> 03:59.066
Is it also improper for me to stick
my cock in your good lady's mouth?

04:00.852 --> 04:04.296
- Jack, have you gone mad?
- Yeah.

04:09.058 --> 04:11.425
One sip, one sip, one sip.

04:13.335 --> 04:16.694
- One sip of lemonade is all I wanted.
- Jack!  No!

04:16.699 --> 04:18.695
Lemon fucking-ade.

04:25.701 --> 04:26.701
<i>Could've been fine.</i>

04:26.702 --> 04:28.735
<i>Stupid fucking bitch.</i>

04:28.848 --> 04:30.432
Oh, they should have
given him a lemonade, man.

04:30.433 --> 04:33.849
Yeah, you noticed they go
the fucking madman with an axe.

04:34.053 --> 04:36.450
Oh, wait and see
what he does with the bodies.

04:36.451 --> 04:37.989
So fucked up.

04:38.060 --> 04:41.453
Hey guys, guys, come on now, please.
What did I say about swearing?

04:41.454 --> 04:42.464
That it's funny.

04:44.616 --> 04:47.647
Just put the phone away.
Put the phone away, now.

04:48.737 --> 04:50.245
Okay, well thanks.

04:51.434 --> 04:55.418
Jeff, the SAT NAV is broken.

04:56.753 --> 04:57.727
What's the matter with it?

04:57.728 --> 05:00.753
It just says we are
completely off the map.

05:00.788 --> 05:02.835
Could it be isn't it
updated or something?

05:02.836 --> 05:04.242
How do you date it?

05:04.365 --> 05:05.500
Plug it into a laptop.

05:05.504 --> 05:09.629
Here, this is a trooper
map, Coordinance Survey.

05:09.630 --> 05:12.599
And they never lie.

05:12.694 --> 05:15.736
There you are, you see?
Mortlake.

05:16.171 --> 05:18.583
Right up the end of this road.
Carry on.

05:36.437 --> 05:39.500
- Are we there yet, Jeff?
- No.

05:50.236 --> 05:51.791
I don't know why you bother her?

05:51.792 --> 05:53.866
She ain't going to talk.
She like a mute or something.

05:54.842 --> 05:58.683
- Woah? What respect?
- No, no, it means she gonna talk.

05:59.548 --> 06:02.566
Woah!  Didn't know
you could talk, Tim.

06:02.887 --> 06:05.102
Yeah!  Cut it out man.
Giving me a headache back there.

06:05.137 --> 06:07.057
We don't want your
life story, man. Alright!

06:20.582 --> 06:24.220
- Ow!  You fucking bitch!
- Well, what's going on, huh?

06:24.472 --> 06:25.965
Calm down, please.

06:30.266 --> 06:31.368
Hey, Tim ..

06:32.687 --> 06:36.453
- Got any sexy pics on your phone?
- No, why?

06:36.888 --> 06:41.033
Not?  Well, you're a
bump behind there?

06:44.120 --> 06:47.150
- Is he always such a prick?
- Yeah.

06:48.277 --> 06:51.766
Oi Jeff, can we smoke?
I definitely need a smoke, mate.

06:58.839 --> 07:02.556
- Oi Jeff. Are we there yet?
- No, twat, we're not fucking there yet!

07:04.091 --> 07:05.142
Sorry.

07:12.385 --> 07:16.819
- I think we're there, Jeff.  Yeah.
- Further up the road, I think.

07:17.304 --> 07:21.947
Trust... trust.  Yeah.
Okay, further up.  Keep going.

07:22.082 --> 07:23.120
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:23.123 --> 07:26.581
Okay.
Why is it not on here?

07:34.378 --> 07:37.329
"The Dirty Hole"?
That's charming.

07:37.350 --> 07:40.094
Well, Mortlake is one of the
north's oldest coal towns.

07:40.095 --> 07:42.517
I suspect the name
probably refers to mining.

07:43.052 --> 07:45.027
You'll like that, yeah old Jeff?

07:47.833 --> 07:49.984
The cottage should
be straight up here.

07:59.223 --> 08:01.622
Well, it's been
certainly rustic, isn't it?

08:02.577 --> 08:05.708
- Rustic?
- This gonna be shit.

08:20.312 --> 08:23.553
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.

08:38.102 --> 08:42.589
We have another ... another 200 yards.
First one to see it gets a prize.

09:05.895 --> 09:06.813
Everybody out.

09:09.129 --> 09:10.759
Come out and get some fresh air.

09:16.162 --> 09:17.506
Wonderful, huh?

09:19.333 --> 09:23.158
No, I'm away till Monday.
I called you not to tweet me.

09:23.159 --> 09:27.823
Yeah.  No, I can't decide.
Yeah, alright, so. Just that ...

09:27.858 --> 09:30.639
- Dwight, phone please?
- What?

09:30.640 --> 09:33.814
We haven't come all the way out
here to look at another way of life

09:33.849 --> 09:37.454
so you can miss it just cos you're
chatting to late on the phone or

09:37.455 --> 09:40.724
or viewing dirty pics, have we?
Hmm.  Phone please.

09:41.559 --> 09:46.391
No, I'm getting licked from some idiot.
Yeah, alright.  Later.

09:49.270 --> 09:52.400
Good lad.  Okay.
Same applies to everybody.

09:52.411 --> 09:59.366
Just put your phones in the bag,
so we can appreciate our environment.

09:59.401 --> 10:02.607
- A fucking joke.
- Okay.  Thank you.

10:04.207 --> 10:05.136
Great!

10:13.321 --> 10:16.549
- What are you thinking?
- What am I thinking?

10:16.584 --> 10:21.739
Well, I think that I've stayed in
better squats than this, Jeff, really.

10:22.425 --> 10:25.061
Don't judge a book
by it's cover, hmm.

10:32.401 --> 10:33.038
Wow!

10:38.384 --> 10:41.046
- What's this?
- A poor house.

10:42.108 --> 10:43.673
Shit cover.  Shit book.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.847
We need to locate
the fuse box, that's all.

10:52.837 --> 10:54.658
Hmm.  That's odd.

10:55.927 --> 10:58.685
Are you worried?
Are you sure?

11:00.085 --> 11:01.268
Come on.

11:28.870 --> 11:31.458
Whoa! Get English thing, all right!

11:31.480 --> 11:35.519
- What are you doing, Dwight? Stop it!
- Oh, come on. I'm fucking joking around.

11:35.520 --> 11:38.330
- No, you're not joking. If you want you
can open the car all the way in and ...

11:38.331 --> 11:39.996
- Stop it.
- Oh, what's it all about?

11:39.997 --> 11:41.852
- She was joking.
- Dennis tried to poke ya?

11:41.853 --> 11:44.458
- Alright, go on.
- Chaotic, it is.

11:44.493 --> 11:48.769
Oh, come on guys.  Cheer up.
We just got the old boiler going.

11:48.770 --> 11:52.394
I know it's a little bit
ramshackled and a little bit dusty.

11:52.495 --> 11:54.875
We are not here on holiday,
are we?  This is the point.

11:55.110 --> 11:58.187
Work together as a team.
Pull together, as one.

11:58.188 --> 12:00.710
And we can start by clearing this
place up together.  How about that?

12:00.711 --> 12:03.554
Yeah, I'm not sleeping in this Jeff
mate, it's a fucking shithole.

12:03.555 --> 12:05.276
Yeah, seriously.
Am I missing the tip?

12:05.411 --> 12:08.982
Yeah, okay.  I know it is a bit of a
shithole, guys, but we are in now.

12:08.983 --> 12:11.315
So we better get
working together as a team.

12:11.317 --> 12:14.527
And a good team that works
together hard, plays hard.

12:14.962 --> 12:17.644
Get all cleaned up
and go down to the pub.

12:18.806 --> 12:21.486
Yeah, can we wait outside.
Please, Kate, come.

12:30.848 --> 12:33.475
Jeff, what is your problem?
I was just having a laugh.

12:33.476 --> 12:35.593
Do you think it is wise
taking these kids to a pub?

12:35.594 --> 12:39.485
I mean, some of them have had alcohol
issues.  Now, Dwight would be a problem.

12:39.520 --> 12:41.636
I wasn't going to get
them pissed in giving message.

12:41.837 --> 12:46.254
I was just trying to motivate them and
have a bit of a laugh. Have a bit of fun.

12:46.589 --> 12:49.509
Jeff, we are care-workers,
we're not their parents.

12:49.544 --> 12:52.299
Why do you always
insist on alienating yourself?

12:52.400 --> 12:54.754
- Alienate?
- Yes, alienate.

12:54.760 --> 12:56.907
You think I'm
alienating people just

12:56.908 --> 12:58.531
because I'm trying to
impose a few rules, huh?

12:58.572 --> 13:02.146
See, there you go again. Rules.
Rules are meant to be broken.

13:02.381 --> 13:05.133
These kids are heavy
because they bite rules, Jeff.

13:05.134 --> 13:11.288
Why don't just chill out, have some
fun and call me about a slut like I did.

13:11.423 --> 13:16.530
- Finished?
- Yeah. I'm finished actually. Thank you.

13:16.533 --> 13:17.446
Good.

13:28.179 --> 13:31.334
Look at this stuff.  Like it's
been here for years.  What is it?

13:32.406 --> 13:33.630
We need this thing along.

13:33.631 --> 13:36.774
Yeah, no I'm not walking down
to the door.  Hey fuck that.

13:40.496 --> 13:41.602
Gosh!

13:47.290 --> 13:49.695
Think there's something
valuable in this one as well.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.014
Valuable, you say?

13:51.015 --> 13:52.325
- Yeah, I think so.
- Alright.

13:53.426 --> 13:54.294
<i>Thank you chief.</i>

13:55.412 --> 14:00.920
Yeah, well done, guys.
This is a very, very real achievement.

14:00.940 --> 14:03.037
I think what this proves is that we,

14:03.038 --> 14:06.306
we as a group from different
backgrounds with different...

14:06.307 --> 14:09.079
- Come to a point!
- Thank you, Dwight.

14:09.232 --> 14:11.372
From different backgrounds
with different problems,

14:11.373 --> 14:15.200
when we work together as a group,
see we can really affect change.

14:15.204 --> 14:18.807
Not really reflects well on
each and everyone of you.

14:18.842 --> 14:25.751
You may not know, but what you learn to
do is turn your negatives into positives.

14:25.760 --> 14:30.834
Let's go stay with you for the rest of
your lives. As you get older and storm ...

14:37.671 --> 14:39.883
Alienating.

14:48.515 --> 14:51.461
Alright.  Come on
everyone.  Cheer up.

14:52.194 --> 14:56.041
Let's walk to the pub, can I see his
name.  We've  been driving all day.

14:56.076 --> 14:58.889
- He's taking a piss.
- Less of the lip, Dwight.

14:59.733 --> 15:02.400
- Find any of my craps in it, what it is?
- Your what?

15:02.413 --> 15:07.202
- My craps.
- I told you to bring
some proper shoes, Zeb.

15:07.342 --> 15:11.535
What do you mean proper?   Do you
know proper?  Can't get even in the UK.

15:11.543 --> 15:15.466
- Hip?
- Put you in 20 crib, Kate.

15:15.470 --> 15:17.077
They must have something
you can rob, man.

15:17.090 --> 15:18.708
Yeah, agree.

15:20.745 --> 15:25.428
I gave some girl an orgasm last night.
She only puff inside and out.

15:27.034 --> 15:31.907
- Okay now.  Go all out wood.
- What about it?

15:32.558 --> 15:36.486
Well, if I set fire in it.
Go off in seconds, huh?

15:44.951 --> 15:46.246
The dirty hole.

15:48.789 --> 15:50.325
Until one, guys.

15:53.417 --> 15:55.858
Come on.  In we go.
That's it.

15:59.010 --> 16:03.362
- Dwight, please behave, please.
- Yeah, yes I will.

16:13.725 --> 16:14.999
Hi there.

16:24.140 --> 16:28.378
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

16:33.199 --> 16:38.234
You three, move.  Get on to the back bar.
Give guests who might sit down.

16:39.706 --> 16:40.830
Move.

16:43.075 --> 16:44.675
- There you go.
- Thank you.

16:49.378 --> 16:53.551
Thanks.  Queen Pub.

16:54.326 --> 16:58.120
I've had it called a few things
in my time, but that's a new one.

16:58.421 --> 17:03.185
1582 these were built.   Used to
be a stop-off road aye women.

17:03.520 --> 17:06.907
These walls lives in Sumesides.

17:07.143 --> 17:10.329
I bet they are.
Quite amazing.

17:15.060 --> 17:16.292
Lovely.

17:25.547 --> 17:27.021
Right, I'll get the menu, then.

17:28.378 --> 17:29.926
Right, who wants to drink?

17:29.961 --> 17:31.941
- One.
- Yeah, I'll have one of that, please.

17:31.952 --> 17:35.041
- Two Cokes.  Sam?
- Coke.

17:35.042 --> 17:37.764
- Tim?
- Yeah, I'll have a coke. Thanks, Kate.

17:42.121 --> 17:43.931
Now well, what are you up to?

17:43.932 --> 17:46.635
Well, I could do with
some hot food, actually.

17:47.270 --> 17:51.678
- Did you see the sign?
- Yes, yes, the hot food sign.

17:51.813 --> 17:55.052
No.  Sign says "not food", not "hot food".

17:55.087 --> 17:56.830
- Not food either.
- Right.

17:57.150 --> 17:59.654
- We don't get it for that crown.
- Umm.

17:59.976 --> 18:03.063
We don't have fun delight
food.  We got scrunchions.

18:03.064 --> 18:08.234
Oh, yes.  Well, two bags of
scrunchions then.  Thank you.

18:09.932 --> 18:12.569
- I'm starving.
- Well, I'm starving too.

18:14.633 --> 18:18.039
- Well?
- Pub's special.  Pork scrunchions.

18:18.172 --> 18:23.323
I am afraid but there are two types.
Hairy and smelly.

18:23.958 --> 18:27.332
- Jeff, that's not funny.
- It's alright, Kate.  Go with the flow.

18:27.367 --> 18:31.290
Plenty of food back at the cottage.  Just
gonna have to head off just without me.

18:31.292 --> 18:34.034
Uhm mm.  So much for their reward, then.

18:34.335 --> 18:39.124
- Fuck me!  Look at that!
- How disgusting.

18:39.125 --> 18:43.926
Home made there.  Wife
makes soup.  Specialty.

18:52.335 --> 18:55.074
Yeah.  Taste great.

18:55.409 --> 18:57.689
So then, what can I
get you kids to drink?

18:57.702 --> 18:59.992
Six cokes, please.

19:00.127 --> 19:05.354
Don't sell coke, Miss.  Not since...
Well, as long as I can remember.

19:05.689 --> 19:09.274
- I can make you a lemonade.
- Fucking lemonade.

19:11.344 --> 19:15.532
- Six lemonades then, please.
- Right. One minute. I'll make a batch now.

19:15.567 --> 19:17.287
- Lovely, thank you.
- Thanks so much.

19:18.382 --> 19:20.238
Lemon fucking-nade.

19:20.673 --> 19:22.925
They are all wrong.
Denim.

19:22.926 --> 19:26.560
- Oh mate. You are great.
- Fucking denim.

19:26.561 --> 19:27.604
Dwight ...

19:27.939 --> 19:30.319
Here we are.
Nice and fresh.

19:30.320 --> 19:32.958
Thank you.  How much
do I owe you for that?

19:33.124 --> 19:35.215
Oh no charge.
Hoops on the house.

19:35.216 --> 19:37.833
Thank you very much.
That's very kind of you.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.984
You are just passing through, eh?

19:39.985 --> 19:44.801
No, we staying for the weekend. We are
doing our project with the kids, so ...

19:45.036 --> 19:49.870
Nearest hostel and camping in Thirsk is
a good 40 mile away. My, don't go there.

19:49.877 --> 19:54.436
No, we staying at Ravenswood
Cottage.  Oop, you alright?

19:54.471 --> 19:55.948
Don't panic.
It was empty.

19:57.383 --> 20:01.532
Ravenswood?  I didn't know
that folks staying over there.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.152
It thought it's about
condemned, now spunk.

20:03.276 --> 20:06.535
It was a bad of state
but we've tidied it all up.

20:06.536 --> 20:07.675
Are you okay?

20:07.840 --> 20:14.339
What is wrong with me tonight?
So, clean now, isn't it?

20:14.374 --> 20:19.511
Yeah, it is actually.
It's quite cozy.  It's nice.

20:19.546 --> 20:22.506
Nice.  Nice.  Very nice.

20:22.841 --> 20:24.045
Thank you.

20:25.736 --> 20:29.470
Bit dusty.  Cheers.

20:51.205 --> 20:52.961
What the fuck was that, Jeff?

20:52.962 --> 20:54.064
Here we go.

20:55.433 --> 20:56.648
Here we go, tonight.

20:56.663 --> 20:59.402
Okay, everybody,
I want to propose a toast.

20:59.712 --> 21:02.741
To a lovely weekend
and a brilliant future.

21:02.742 --> 21:04.774
Cheers, everyone.
Cheers.

21:06.356 --> 21:10.175
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, I think he is slightly senile.

21:13.534 --> 21:16.173
- It tastes like piss!
- Dwight...

21:16.408 --> 21:18.765
Or ... there won't be tomorrow night.

21:49.369 --> 21:51.470
The piss is pretty little bad.

21:54.279 --> 21:58.193
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
Take it to the back, you dumb-head!

21:59.871 --> 22:01.419
Go out laddie.

22:06.702 --> 22:08.917
- Real lemon.
- Have you got a tissue?

22:08.918 --> 22:10.218
Real lemons.

22:13.354 --> 22:15.426
<i>Guys, will you stop it.</i>

22:47.567 --> 22:48.489
Hello.

22:51.758 --> 22:52.985
Who are you?

22:55.679 --> 22:57.931
You from city?

23:01.080 --> 23:02.601
You're pretty.

23:11.221 --> 23:12.428
What is your name?

23:15.336 --> 23:18.578
Do you like carrots?
Where are you going?

23:22.722 --> 23:26.529
- Boy!  Get out!  Go on.  Out!
- What?

23:26.530 --> 23:29.844
You are not a guests in here.

23:33.879 --> 23:36.779
You alright, love?
He's harmless, really.

23:37.014 --> 23:41.600
Don't get many new faces.
Excited, that's all.

23:41.602 --> 23:44.758
He whatever, yeah,
he a lover not a fighter.

23:44.759 --> 23:46.505
Good to hear.

23:46.571 --> 23:49.946
Why, just a word
of warning, though.

23:49.947 --> 23:54.599
There's someone around these parts
that care nought for strangers.

23:54.954 --> 24:00.532
But just as long as you keep to yourselves,
everyone is very friendly, you know.

24:00.667 --> 24:05.558
Just say you're friends of Jim
of Dirty Hole, they all know me.

24:05.993 --> 24:10.186
- That's correct, thanks Jim.
- Thank you.

24:12.816 --> 24:15.068
- Sam, are you okay?
- Alright. So?

24:16.444 --> 24:20.902
The cottage we were staying in was a
working farm for people with problems.

24:20.925 --> 24:24.471
Place where the troubled could
recuperate away from society.

24:24.472 --> 24:27.705
They shut all these kind of
places down in the 1970s.

24:27.740 --> 24:29.194
What kind of problems?

24:29.195 --> 24:33.717
People with disability issues mostly.
They also took on the mentally ill.

24:33.718 --> 24:36.271
- All under one roof.
- Really?

24:36.582 --> 24:40.868
Yeah, very unPC now, I know,
but was the norm back then.

24:41.084 --> 24:43.401
Hide the problem people away.

24:44.644 --> 24:46.926
- That's terrible.
- Yeah.

24:47.876 --> 24:48.844
Yeah, that's terrible.

24:49.309 --> 24:51.643
So what's the biggest
thing you ever burned?

24:52.244 --> 24:53.739
Uhh, my school.

24:54.914 --> 24:56.129
Oh my God.

24:57.259 --> 25:00.561
No, it was empty.
I didn't kill anyone or anything.

25:02.004 --> 25:03.224
Cool.

25:05.851 --> 25:09.582
Why did you do it?
If you don't mind me asking?

25:10.330 --> 25:13.449
No, it's cold that morning.

25:14.224 --> 25:18.470
I was bored.
Fucking shit town.

25:18.505 --> 25:22.408
Shit prospects.
Teachers who didn't give a toss.

25:22.908 --> 25:26.823
I mean you sit there with all the other
kids ... all the fucking dickhead kids.

25:26.924 --> 25:27.815
Like Dwight?

25:27.929 --> 25:29.584
Yeah, exactly like Dwight.

25:30.185 --> 25:33.404
I mean, sit there and
let them run the class.

25:34.039 --> 25:38.157
No, I mean, no one learned anything.
The whole system was a fucking joke.

25:38.792 --> 25:41.350
- So...
- Ka-boom.

25:42.217 --> 25:46.976
Yeah, exactly. Ka-boom.
I burned the fucking system.

25:52.862 --> 25:55.577
Did you sleep alright, darling?

25:58.179 --> 26:00.798
- Want some sugar?
- Yeah, please.

26:02.039 --> 26:05.116
I didn't fucking
touch your stuff, dude.

26:05.117 --> 26:07.086
Fucking liar, Dwight.
I know you did.

26:07.092 --> 26:08.451
- What's going on, boys?

26:08.452 --> 26:10.694
Hey, I'm starving Kate.
What's for breakfast?

26:10.714 --> 26:11.905
Tim, you okay?

26:12.606 --> 26:15.840
I leave my things in order.
That's why I know you used them, right?

26:15.875 --> 26:18.848
Twat didn't take his OCD
pills this morning, did he?

26:18.853 --> 26:20.119
- Fuck you Dwight.
- Yeah!

26:20.120 --> 26:22.729
What the fuck you
gonna do, you mug?

26:22.730 --> 26:25.266
Dwight!
Now do you want some breakfast?

26:26.692 --> 26:30.177
I want a sausage.  See I like a
sausage.  Do you have one in here?

26:30.309 --> 26:33.889
Dude, are you talking about a sausage,
or are you talking about your cock?

26:35.578 --> 26:36.658
I thought so.

26:36.759 --> 26:38.941
- Morning, morning.
- Morning.

26:38.976 --> 26:42.485
Half past seven, we ought to
get going.  It is a beautiful day.

26:42.486 --> 26:45.107
Oh, we're just having some
breakfast.  So Joey Beans.

26:45.142 --> 26:47.915
- Oh, I thought you'd be done by now.
- No, just chatting.

26:52.956 --> 26:55.153
Health and safety, I'm afraid.

26:56.420 --> 26:58.373
Well, if it's that,
I not wearing one of these.

26:58.374 --> 27:01.020
It got me out look
like a fucking bin man.

27:01.621 --> 27:05.113
- Here's a large one for you.
- A small, please.

27:05.803 --> 27:11.042
- Thanks, Jeff.
- Tim!  Catch!  There you go.

27:11.629 --> 27:16.099
Good.  And one for me.
So, ETD ten minutes?

27:16.869 --> 27:18.264
I Roger that.

27:21.932 --> 27:27.473
- We'll be ready.
- Good.  I'll be ... just great.

27:35.241 --> 27:36.906
Come on.  Don't struggle.

27:53.241 --> 27:57.626
Early run.  Let's get these
lights by to Milton Keynes.

27:58.791 --> 28:03.263
- Absolutely beautiful.
- It depends.

28:03.698 --> 28:08.542
- Man, how much further?
- Boring, ain't got food, does it?

28:09.560 --> 28:11.436
Yeah, bro.

28:14.559 --> 28:16.115
What do you do, huh?

28:18.198 --> 28:19.543
Wait up!

28:23.533 --> 28:27.310
- So, what are you doing here, anyway?
- What's it to you?

28:28.251 --> 28:30.485
No, I was just saying.

28:31.802 --> 28:35.393
- No, looking out for a boy.
- Using a gun?

28:35.728 --> 28:39.552
Our boys are close you know.
Looking out for each other.

28:39.587 --> 28:45.295
If someones having a gun at my
mate, I'm going to cap that fucker.

28:49.729 --> 28:50.733
Bang!

29:18.349 --> 29:21.314
Trains! Halleluiah.

29:21.891 --> 29:24.699
Nuso arivay.  Come on!

29:24.930 --> 29:28.535
Overcome one-selves.  That's it.

29:32.513 --> 29:33.221
Okay.

29:36.306 --> 29:37.302
Good luck.

29:48.572 --> 29:51.513
Look at the graffiti on
that.   It's really nice.

29:52.705 --> 29:55.852
Oh yeah.  How did they get
all these down here anyway?

29:56.653 --> 29:58.246
One sweet thing.

29:58.381 --> 30:01.517
- That's it.
- What thing is going to die?

30:01.642 --> 30:04.188
Not really, it's recycling.

30:04.389 --> 30:06.716
That's it.
It's a community service game

30:06.751 --> 30:09.646
designed to generate funds
while it turns on central skills

30:09.647 --> 30:11.049
needed for today's society.

30:12.814 --> 30:13.910
To do what?

30:14.462 --> 30:18.920
It just means astricting
anything of value that is left

30:18.921 --> 30:20.794
and forking on basically.

30:20.795 --> 30:21.795
Exactly.

30:22.085 --> 30:25.506
- And why didn't you say that?
- Exactly.

30:27.041 --> 30:28.678
Mind the nettles, Zeb.

30:38.381 --> 30:41.337
- Tim, get out!
- Tim, out of there, please.

30:41.956 --> 30:44.243
Zeb, come on.
Dwight, get the barrow.

30:45.700 --> 30:46.694
Come on!  Chomp, chomp!

30:48.411 --> 30:51.574
Come on.  Here you go.  Here's a
ladder, right.  Here's another one.

30:54.434 --> 30:55.964
Right, there's a toolbox.

30:58.616 --> 31:01.115
Okay, you got that?
Right.

31:02.193 --> 31:05.071
- You see this?
- Right, it's Dwight's.

31:05.497 --> 31:10.097
- Ooh, the wheelbarrow, Zeb!
- Be careful!  Careful.

31:11.619 --> 31:15.493
- Just wait for us!
- Maybe we should leave a note?

31:15.909 --> 31:18.417
Yeah, well maybe someone
should be here to help us.

31:18.418 --> 31:20.805
What, did you arrange for
somebody to come and help us?

31:20.840 --> 31:23.281
Yeah, of course I arranged for
someone to come and help us.

31:23.282 --> 31:24.006
Where are they?

31:24.036 --> 31:24.968
I don't know.

31:26.266 --> 31:28.748
Well, we can't take those
without telling someone.

31:28.749 --> 31:30.403
Well, maybe we should give a note.

31:39.619 --> 31:43.237
Copper, aluminum,
brass, zinc, solenoids.

31:43.505 --> 31:45.449
You are amazed what
treasures we gonna ...

31:45.450 --> 31:47.420
Yeah, but Jeff, how are we
supposed to know what is what?

31:47.425 --> 31:51.924
Because I've got a checklist here and
I'm going to split into two teams.

31:52.334 --> 31:57.092
Okay A-Team,
it's you, Sam, and me

31:57.093 --> 32:00.015
and Zeb, Dwight
and Jeff in the B team.

32:00.050 --> 32:02.633
The team to get the most
valuable material wins.

32:02.968 --> 32:05.545
- Win what?
- Well there was no prize, Zeb.

32:05.550 --> 32:09.684
- What's the point then?
- Prize is sense of achievement.

32:10.519 --> 32:12.940
Okay, twenty quid the A team wins.

32:14.886 --> 32:16.425
- Oh, come on, Jeffry.
What you waiting for?

32:16.438 --> 32:17.987
Put your money, they
ain't gonna loose.

32:17.988 --> 32:19.987
All right.
Why the bloody hell not?

32:24.937 --> 32:28.115
You're on.  High five.
Come on kid.

32:33.629 --> 32:35.549
Listen guys, I just
wanted to say that

32:35.550 --> 32:38.791
if you have anything to chat to me about
anything, I'm there you know , if not

32:38.792 --> 32:41.509
we don't spend that
much time on our own, but,

32:42.210 --> 32:45.086
yeah, I just wanted
you to know that.

32:45.870 --> 32:48.788
It's not just about finding copper,
you know, this weekend,

32:48.789 --> 32:51.805
it's about just
having a bit of fun, and ...

32:53.200 --> 32:55.208
- Yeah.  Cheers Kate.
- Yeah.

32:55.209 --> 33:01.892
- Am I?
- You are ... beautiful.

33:02.669 --> 33:09.420
Right.  Well, kind of take a look
in there, so let's just start.

33:09.699 --> 33:13.314
I don't know, I mean, I think
these are Mark IIIs, you know and

33:13.449 --> 33:18.373
pretty sure the copper's back in
there.  Nothing much is down there.

33:18.408 --> 33:21.035
- Yeah, is copper good?
- Yeah, copper's worth much.

33:21.036 --> 33:22.359
- Is it?
- Yeah.

33:22.360 --> 33:23.761
Let's go on out there.

33:31.256 --> 33:34.530
- What the fuck you think you're doing?
- Sorry, Jeff.

33:34.539 --> 33:39.573
Now stop vandalizing and salvage!
There is a difference.

33:47.039 --> 33:49.532
How are we going to find anything
we need?  This is a shit hole.

33:49.833 --> 33:50.696
What?

33:50.697 --> 33:51.725
Look at the place.

33:52.026 --> 33:54.962
We're not actually going to
do it, that's what I want.

33:54.963 --> 33:57.362
- Fuck that, man.
- Yeah.

33:59.802 --> 34:02.692
Fuck it.  Let's just fuck it up.

34:04.633 --> 34:06.486
- Come on Zeb!
- Fuck it!

34:07.628 --> 34:10.128
Come on, come on, come on!

34:10.219 --> 34:12.687
Oh yeah.
Fuck it up, babe.

34:22.367 --> 34:25.011
- Get up!
- Oh shit!

34:37.699 --> 34:41.462
- Right.  Which one first?
- Ehh, then I'll do this one, huh?

34:41.670 --> 34:44.775
- It's a Mark II, and I think
these have got copper to it.

34:44.777 --> 34:46.726
Okay, okay, how do
you know it's a Mark II?

34:47.591 --> 34:49.916
- Well, it says there, isn't it?
- Right from there also have.

34:49.917 --> 34:51.311
I do not know it.

34:51.512 --> 34:53.103
- Is the lines okay?
- Yeah.

34:53.105 --> 34:53.887
Chop! Chop!

34:54.088 --> 34:56.186
Watch yourself on this, Tim.

34:56.420 --> 35:01.903
Alright. Okay.
That was Jeff's twenty quid.

35:02.038 --> 35:05.963
Are you alright?  Go on.  Are you
willing to pick up the toolbox, Kate?

35:09.332 --> 35:10.614
Here you go.

35:14.682 --> 35:16.985
- Yeah, yeah, I just gotta find cups.
- Okay.

35:23.289 --> 35:25.529
What is that?

35:26.524 --> 35:29.156
- Stink center.
- Come here.

35:42.032 --> 35:43.011
Hello?

35:46.688 --> 35:49.972
Oh, wicked.
Knock it out.

35:52.927 --> 35:58.007
Oh well, that is lead in there.
Fucking Jesus.

36:01.670 --> 36:03.637
Hey, I got copper
cable for you there.

36:11.578 --> 36:12.784
Jeff?

36:25.123 --> 36:27.892
Hello?  Who's there?

37:19.097 --> 37:21.072
Guys! Guys!
Please, what are you thinking?

37:21.073 --> 37:23.153
Chill out, please.
Just calm down.

37:23.239 --> 37:25.899
You know, you can't just smash
things up all day long. alright.

37:25.900 --> 37:26.725
Why?

37:26.750 --> 37:29.593
I believe if you continue, I'll say
you screwed up the weekend.

37:29.594 --> 37:30.982
There's a good
chance you'll go to jail.

37:31.017 --> 37:33.178
Well , bull if Jeff's unit say that.

37:33.279 --> 37:35.249
Well, you're right then.
I'll probably wouldn't.

37:35.250 --> 37:38.651
Just toe the line, alright?

37:47.718 --> 37:50.574
Yo, Sam.  Come here.

38:01.290 --> 38:02.657
What?

38:04.241 --> 38:09.051
- It wasn't me.
- I didn't say it was.

38:11.941 --> 38:16.855
- Do not want to go find out what it is?
- Yeah.

38:17.383 --> 38:18.983
What do you think it is?

38:19.084 --> 38:23.001
The grass burns easy.
It's oil based.  Come on!

38:29.133 --> 38:30.194
Tim?

38:35.193 --> 38:36.259
Sam?

38:49.024 --> 38:52.585
- What is it?
- I don't know.

38:57.039 --> 38:59.431
Fuck!
It's an animal!

38:59.617 --> 39:04.093
Those sick bastards!
Sam, I'm going to free this one.

39:05.080 --> 39:08.626
Come on, man.
It's alright. Come on, man.

39:09.615 --> 39:11.607
Go ahead!  Go ahead.

39:12.442 --> 39:13.591
Go on kid.

39:14.192 --> 39:16.915
- That's our sense of achievement.
- Yeah.

39:18.749 --> 39:20.345
Oh fuck!

39:38.233 --> 39:39.218
Kate!

39:39.548 --> 39:40.419
Kate!

39:40.849 --> 39:41.833
Kate!

39:42.630 --> 39:43.718
Kate!

39:44.566 --> 39:45.548
Kate!

39:55.086 --> 39:55.922
Kate!

39:59.233 --> 40:00.192
Kate!

40:01.653 --> 40:04.198
Hello pretty.

40:05.802 --> 40:09.621
Time for one of your five a day.
Give it to me, girl.

40:12.179 --> 40:17.259
Don't worry, girl.
We've got this for your boyfriend.

40:38.049 --> 40:41.900
Let him go now.
Now!

40:42.476 --> 40:43.977
Let him go.

40:44.791 --> 40:47.621
- Tim! Get Jeff!
- Jeff!

40:49.539 --> 40:52.259
What are you doing to us?
Freak!

40:55.153 --> 40:58.314
- What is going on?
- He was attacking Tim and Sam.

40:58.315 --> 41:01.431
- Let me go, you fucking twat!
- Shut up!

41:02.324 --> 41:05.107
Alright. Alright.
Let him go.

41:08.562 --> 41:10.800
Can someone mind telling
me what's going on here?

41:10.801 --> 41:14.412
These sick bastards. They ...
come in a manner of ...

41:14.413 --> 41:17.204
It was assaulting Sam,
So I hit him with a spade.

41:17.205 --> 41:19.124
He's smoking at me twice!

41:19.425 --> 41:21.869
Hey you!
Be quiet!

41:21.870 --> 41:23.809
Maybe he's only lacking ...

41:23.810 --> 41:25.865
And he was burning
live animals as well.

41:26.966 --> 41:29.586
- Burning animals?
- Yeah, they're all sick.

41:33.546 --> 41:35.554
Those are my fucking tools.

41:36.255 --> 41:38.440
Ask me how it must
have gotten there.

41:38.475 --> 41:42.870
- Alright. They're your tools, huh.
- Hmm.

41:42.871 --> 41:45.042
You have a ...
so you have them, alright.

41:45.143 --> 41:48.797
There you go. We obey you.
We back off.  Just go!

41:55.416 --> 41:58.782
If you come any one of them kids again
with so much as a bloody runner bean ...

41:59.627 --> 42:01.739
I swear to God
I will bloody do you.

42:09.396 --> 42:10.556
She wants it all.

42:12.360 --> 42:14.937
Take your tools and piss off
okay, and I'm warning you.

42:14.472 --> 42:19.400
Ooh, my tools gonna be up her arse.

42:19.501 --> 42:21.970
Right up to its brouts.

42:22.005 --> 42:27.026
Get out!  Go away.  Go!
Fuck up you filthy bastards.

42:27.027 --> 42:29.019
Go on.  Get out!

42:30.789 --> 42:34.837
Just get out!
Before I knock your fucking skull off!

42:37.193 --> 42:41.445
Shit!  Jeff!  Are you okay?
Oh God.

42:42.284 --> 42:44.833
It's okay, I'm fine.
Oh, Jesus!

42:50.079 --> 42:51.334
It's alright.  It's okay.

42:51.335 --> 42:52.772
No, Zeb!  Get us off the field!

42:52.773 --> 42:55.463
We need phone an ambulance, Jeff.
Where's your phone?

42:57.076 --> 42:58.251
They're at the house.

42:58.252 --> 43:00.907
Timmy, give me a
tourniquet, a rope or a belt.

43:04.917 --> 43:06.767
We can't give up. Quick!

43:09.670 --> 43:11.306
That's right.
Hold the cut.

43:11.307 --> 43:14.839
- It's okay, it's okay.
- Fuck!

43:16.553 --> 43:17.813
We need some help!

43:21.184 --> 43:22.153
Stop!

43:26.146 --> 43:27.891
Dwight!
Go and find something.

43:27.892 --> 43:30.862
We need to take him down the hill.
Quick!

43:59.567 --> 44:03.073
Let me tell thee all,
the fate that did befall...

44:03.374 --> 44:06.427
Hey by, hey by grown.

44:06.962 --> 44:11.101
When outsiders came and
tried to stake a claim ...

44:11.202 --> 44:14.429
Hey by, hey by grown.

44:15.364 --> 44:19.276
Next thing got the note, they want to go...

44:19.477 --> 44:22.616
Hey by, hey by go.

44:22.951 --> 44:27.211
So we pulled down father's
jacks and chop off all his legs...

44:27.248 --> 44:29.079
Somebody please call an ambulance!

44:29.080 --> 44:31.771
Mr. Lockwood, please,
please call an ambulance!

44:32.072 --> 44:33.713
Bloody nora.

44:33.948 --> 44:37.635
Brendan, get this on.  Get him in
the kitchen, put him on the table.

44:37.826 --> 44:40.416
No, no we need a phone.
He needs an ambulance.

44:40.417 --> 44:43.166
He's losing most of the blood, please.
Basically he's ...

44:43.167 --> 44:47.219
It's all right love.  Let's get him
comfortable till ambulance arrives.

44:47.297 --> 44:50.413
That's a good forty miles of country
roads.  It will be at least an hour.

44:50.577 --> 44:53.556
We can't wait an hour.
He's lost too much blood.

44:53.557 --> 44:54.826
That's how long it takes.

44:56.430 --> 44:57.283
Jeff.

44:58.445 --> 44:59.253
Jeff!

45:03.537 --> 45:07.106
- Okay.  Be careful with him.
- Tim, help me with his legs.

45:09.072 --> 45:12.509
- Sorry mate.
- That's gonna teach us

45:14.007 --> 45:16.827
- What happened?
- Those lads attacked us in there!

45:16.828 --> 45:19.024
- What lads?
- It's locals.  And the way he threw out.

45:20.264 --> 45:24.219
- What did they do to want us threw out?
- It's only me and Sam, making two of us.

45:24.254 --> 45:27.224
- They were burning animals.
- And they attacked you say?

45:27.687 --> 45:33.065
- Fucking inbred cunts started it.
- Hey! But not all cunts from around here.

45:33.257 --> 45:34.978
The man is dying, please!

45:35.179 --> 45:37.708
Why don't we call the
police, don't you see?

45:37.702 --> 45:41.150
- Yeah, Wilf's on the phone.  Now!
- We need to clean it.

45:41.151 --> 45:42.745
We need to take his trousers off.

45:42.746 --> 45:46.508
Alright pal.  I'll give you
something to ease the pain.

45:58.506 --> 45:59.667
Give me that!

46:09.168 --> 46:12.524
Hey!  You dark bastard!

46:12.525 --> 46:16.739
You ...fucking bastard.

46:17.040 --> 46:19.000
Fucking ... bastard.

46:20.741 --> 46:22.573
Don't give me that shit, what.

46:22.574 --> 46:25.541
You!
And then fuck it up Fridays.

46:25.842 --> 46:27.745
I didn't do now.

46:28.046 --> 46:31.720
Didn't do know.
The book, you fucking scoundrel.

46:31.871 --> 46:35.645
What fucking not?

46:35.643 --> 46:39.482
He did fell over. He got a
life in something on my own.

46:39.483 --> 46:40.954
He ripped them down both.

46:41.655 --> 46:42.854
You what?

46:42.855 --> 46:45.116
He even scold Bathius.

46:47.372 --> 46:53.005
- Then he tripped up and he cut himself.
- Huh, he fell over.

46:53.006 --> 46:56.583
- It won't grace!
- Why didn't you say so?

46:57.753 --> 47:01.724
Anyway, can't take them here.

47:03.767 --> 47:11.651
Put the word out.  About an early show.
Free admission.  And then scrunchions.

47:17.374 --> 47:22.249
Right.  I want this place
spotless.  Feed him to pigs.

47:22.250 --> 47:25.895
- Ah, he must weigh a ton, Dad.
- Well, chop him up then!

47:30.185 --> 47:33.258
- Fucking hot in here.
- Dwight, please.

47:34.442 --> 47:37.875
- What the fuck did you do?
- Will you shut the fuck up, Dwight!

47:37.877 --> 47:41.335
Oh, they burning animals, Ray.
They are, then set them free.

47:41.436 --> 47:43.225
You fucking do gooders.

47:43.226 --> 47:46.217
You know, you and your spark of
a girlfriend are fucked, you know that.

47:46.219 --> 47:48.550
For fuck sake, Dwight!

47:48.896 --> 47:52.340
We are all going to fucking die
if we don't stick together.

47:52.341 --> 47:54.406
Do you understand me, eh?

47:56.833 --> 48:01.436
Think of something!   We've gotta get
out of here!  They're gonna come back.

48:01.443 --> 48:05.823
Ah, I think I can get us out of here.
Do you see something really sharp.

48:06.633 --> 48:08.991
Anything.  It's too thick.

48:08.992 --> 48:10.755
It's gonna fit in the
lock.  It's too thick.

48:13.385 --> 48:14.700
- Tim
- What?

48:14.703 --> 48:16.956
- Have you got anything?
- No!  I fucking haven't.

48:16.967 --> 48:17.961
Think then!

48:17.962 --> 48:21.204

- Perfect.  That's perfect.

48:23.914 --> 48:25.855

- Be patient.

48:25.856 --> 48:28.264
- Come on, hurry!
- Calm down.

48:28.484 --> 48:32.366
- Look at me. I'll ...

48:33.673 --> 48:36.447
- Okay calm down,  it's okay.
- Come on!

48:37.265 --> 48:38.443
Come on.

48:43.315 --> 48:44.815
Well, that's a lot ladies.

48:44.816 --> 48:48.809
- Let's say it's their ...
- Any one want this?

48:49.849 --> 48:50.786
God!

48:51.030 --> 48:56.544
I hear there's a show tonight.
Can I come?

48:59.434 --> 49:03.271
- Don't know.  Can't hear you, Ron.
- Will you ask your dad?

49:03.948 --> 49:10.673
- I'll ask.  No promises.
- Okay you do that. I might see you later.

49:11.431 --> 49:12.529
Tonight?

49:13.255 --> 49:18.403
Excuse me.  Come on Turkish.
We're going to a show.

49:21.868 --> 49:23.102
Look what he did.

49:36.870 --> 49:37.972
Which one?

49:40.294 --> 49:43.916
Please, we don't understand why
you're doing this.  What's going on?

49:44.017 --> 49:46.278
What the fuck is happening?
We have not done anything.

49:46.279 --> 49:48.676
- Alright, love, alright.
- Please let us just go.

49:48.977 --> 49:52.580
- I don't understand!
- Just shut your fucking cake hole!

49:52.582 --> 49:56.633
Or do you want to be next?   Is
that it?  What do you reckon, son?

49:58.818 --> 50:02.160
- No, save her for a bit. She is ...
- No.  Stop.

50:03.780 --> 50:04.727
Fuck off!

50:13.289 --> 50:18.082
Whatever you want with us, please leave
us alone, please.  Please leave us alone.

50:21.447 --> 50:22.294
Sam!

50:23.693 --> 50:25.076
Let me go, I say.

50:25.604 --> 50:26.651
Sam!

50:27.570 --> 50:29.804
Open this fucking door!

50:34.843 --> 50:37.117
Hurry up.
Get him over to the barn.

50:41.255 --> 50:45.162
Help!  Someone.
Somebody come help me, please!

50:51.406 --> 50:55.178
Get off me please!
Let me go!

51:00.291 --> 51:03.321
What are you doing?
Damn it!

51:05.755 --> 51:06.835
Get off me!

51:11.116 --> 51:12.376
I swear, I won't...

51:14.357 --> 51:15.717
How you guys doing?

51:17.871 --> 51:19.534
What's he doing?

51:29.147 --> 51:30.869
You're crazy fuck!

51:34.444 --> 51:37.236
Your father, he was best.

51:37.702 --> 51:41.388
He knew how to put on a show.
Put real pizazz into it.

51:41.389 --> 51:46.675
Please, let me go.  I won't
tell anyone.  Just let me go.

51:47.403 --> 51:49.117
What is wrong with you?

51:52.397 --> 51:55.885
The laughter.  And dancing.

51:58.338 --> 52:02.603
I do a good job.
Too messy.

52:04.410 --> 52:06.321
Talking of you bastard.

52:16.230 --> 52:21.058
Jesus.  Why don't you let me go?
You fucking ugly bastard!

52:29.402 --> 52:31.597
Watts, you can go.

52:35.736 --> 52:36.910
What you gonna do?

52:44.588 --> 52:45.907
What are you doing?

52:48.615 --> 52:50.964
I'm going to make you famous, lad.

52:52.265 --> 52:55.864
What's wrong with you?
Fucking mad!

52:57.050 --> 52:58.143
Help!

53:07.260 --> 53:09.656
I need help.  Help!

53:12.363 --> 53:17.083
Let me tell you all
when I wake up this ...

53:18.084 --> 53:21.688
Day by, bygone

53:23.689 --> 53:28.355
Went outside his king and
started to stake a claim

53:29.156 --> 53:32.898
Day by, bygone.

53:33.925 --> 53:38.937
Pulled down father's pants,
and chopped off both his legs...

53:39.120 --> 53:41.817
Open this fucking door!

53:42.134 --> 53:45.200
Oh fuck. Fuck!

53:47.742 --> 53:48.650
Oh man!

53:48.651 --> 53:52.597
What do you want me doing?
What the fuck is going on?

53:52.600 --> 53:57.718
And took his gutsy wife
and buried her alive...

53:57.819 --> 54:01.725
Day by, day bygone.

54:24.023 --> 54:27.785
Get my shirt ready for the second show.
This one will be covered in shit.

54:30.988 --> 54:35.792
Day by day bygone.

54:41.597 --> 54:48.372
Oh, you beautiful, beautiful
people.  Except for you.

54:48.380 --> 54:51.197
It's not your face or
your neck just grown up?

54:52.779 --> 54:54.415
Only joking.

54:54.416 --> 54:59.848
No, but seriously folks, it's great to
be back with all the familiar faces.

54:59.944 --> 55:02.712
And exciting news.

55:02.747 --> 55:09.648
A little birdie tells me we've
got shows lined up all week.

55:09.649 --> 55:14.842
Same time, same place,
etcetera, etcetera.

55:14.877 --> 55:23.272
So, without further ado,
on with the show.

56:31.035 --> 56:32.827
Leave me alone, please!

56:33.902 --> 56:38.263
You see up in the nose.
Let's see what can fit up there.

56:52.290 --> 56:54.240
- Bastard!
- Calm down, please Tim.

56:55.098 --> 56:57.619
- I can't.
- It's not gonna fucking work, mate.

56:57.620 --> 57:00.676
And it's worth a try, yeah.
It's worth a try, mate.

57:00.677 --> 57:02.774
Oh, fuck out of here.

57:02.809 --> 57:06.053
- Don't shout, please!
- We gonna get the fuck out of here, Kate!

57:13.873 --> 57:15.303
Do you like that?

58:12.123 --> 58:14.021
Thank you very much.

59:03.358 --> 59:08.074
Nearly got it.
Come on. Come on.

59:14.815 --> 59:15.634
Come on!

59:23.044 --> 59:27.909
One for you.
And one for me.

59:30.244 --> 59:32.071
One for you.

59:34.736 --> 59:36.755
And one for me.

59:40.493 --> 59:43.249
- Hello Wilf.
- Hey Ron.

59:46.436 --> 59:52.568
I hear there is a show on today.
I bet it's a good crowd?

59:52.703 --> 59:54.525
Ahh, just a few.

59:56.561 --> 01:00:00.643
Don't be enough room for
one more, would there?

01:00:00.644 --> 01:00:01.550
Sorry, Ron.

01:00:01.743 --> 01:00:04.788
Jim said, they don't take
to your fucking little rat

01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:06.468
after what happened the last time.

01:00:06.626 --> 01:00:10.154
It won't happen again.
I've left the little fella at home.

01:00:15.753 --> 01:00:18.067
Don't take this personally, Ron.

01:00:23.025 --> 01:00:24.561
Now, fuck off.

01:00:25.496 --> 01:00:28.503
- Fork best there?
- The best.

01:00:28.938 --> 01:00:31.480
- Maybe next time.
- Maybe next time.

01:00:31.481 --> 01:00:32.637
Alright.

01:00:40.502 --> 01:00:45.552
One for you.
And one for me.

01:01:23.164 --> 01:01:24.264
Help!

01:01:33.675 --> 01:01:37.117
Shut up.  Okay,
don't say anything.

01:01:37.176 --> 01:01:39.918
The door is open now.
Wait now. Wait there.

01:01:46.342 --> 01:01:48.952
Well, what is there for all
of you to see about, eh, eh?

01:01:49.484 --> 01:01:54.684
Now don't go away, because we've got
a bonus attraction coming over next.

01:01:54.485 --> 01:01:56.895
The house special.

01:01:58.313 --> 01:02:00.831
Right after this intermission.

01:02:01.134 --> 01:02:05.200
We've been expecting
requests.  So don't be shy.

01:02:15.041 --> 01:02:17.353
Hey, get another one now.

01:02:17.354 --> 01:02:21.440
Get the shit brother and
get that bookey off your head.

01:02:46.252 --> 01:02:47.161
Hey, you!

01:02:53.246 --> 01:02:55.185
Come on, what you waiting for!
Go!

01:02:59.481 --> 01:03:01.511
- Dwight!
- Dwight!

01:03:02.498 --> 01:03:05.182
Move!  Run!

01:03:06.026 --> 01:03:07.073
Dwight!

01:03:07.515 --> 01:03:08.641
What the fuck!

01:03:08.642 --> 01:03:09.908
Dwight!  Come on!

01:03:13.548 --> 01:03:14.737
Stay the fuck down!

01:03:15.525 --> 01:03:16.422
Dwight!

01:03:17.677 --> 01:03:19.181
Come here you bastard!

01:03:19.182 --> 01:03:20.061
Kate!

01:03:20.062 --> 01:03:21.119
Fuck it!  Go!

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:21.987
Come in.

01:03:24.938 --> 01:03:25.610
No!

01:03:29.172 --> 01:03:30.484
Kate!  Come on.

01:03:31.012 --> 01:03:31.903
Fighter!

01:03:33.730 --> 01:03:34.763
Stop it!

01:03:34.764 --> 01:03:37.228
Come here little girl.
Come to Wilsie.

01:03:37.229 --> 01:03:38.109
Dwight!

01:03:38.410 --> 01:03:39.839
Kate, come on!

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:40.825
Go to hell!

01:03:40.926 --> 01:03:42.318
Dwight!

01:03:45.886 --> 01:03:47.339
Dwight!

01:03:54.239 --> 01:03:56.954
- Where did they go?
- They took the hook road.

01:03:57.412 --> 01:03:59.271
- Don't get stabbed next.
- What?

01:03:59.272 --> 01:04:02.031
- Don't worry about that.
Taste that.

01:04:04.237 --> 01:04:07.863
Get that shit to me father now.
I clean up.

01:04:07.977 --> 01:04:09.207
Go get the others, piss.

01:04:09.818 --> 01:04:10.898
Bring 'em back.

01:04:13.915 --> 01:04:15.442
We gonna fucking eat well tonight.

01:04:16.968 --> 01:04:18.976
Keep coming!  Come on!

01:04:21.922 --> 01:04:23.161
- Stop!
- Come on!

01:04:23.468 --> 01:04:25.448
Come on, we gotta
get back to the cottage.

01:04:25.949 --> 01:04:28.359
Are you okay?

01:04:28.709 --> 01:04:30.599
- Watch you step.
- Yeah.
- Come on!

01:04:43.552 --> 01:04:47.268
Come on, Cole.  It's about
timing in that light next.

01:04:47.530 --> 01:04:48.886
Get the wig on him.

01:04:56.348 --> 01:04:57.470
Aunt Sally.

01:05:00.111 --> 01:05:02.011
You ready?
Away then.

01:05:17.795 --> 01:05:21.654
Gentlemen, ladies, and Angus.

01:05:24.948 --> 01:05:30.085
You have had your first course, but that
was shite compared to the main attraction.

01:05:30.310 --> 01:05:36.990
I give you the not quite
right, most dishonourable ...

01:05:36.992 --> 01:05:43.689
... Fisher and his
astounding dirty vessels.

01:06:24.524 --> 01:06:25.880
- I haven't got the keys.
- Huh?

01:06:25.881 --> 01:06:28.483
- I haven't got the keys.
- Then bring me some other keys.

01:06:28.484 --> 01:06:30.618
I'm fucking not giving the bag.
I haven't got the keys.

01:06:30.619 --> 01:06:33.339
- Which means it's inside the fucking bag.
- It's not my fault.

01:06:34.636 --> 01:06:36.664
Oh my God!

01:06:39.335 --> 01:06:41.779
Shut up Sam, for fuck sake!

01:06:42.861 --> 01:06:45.949
- What we gonna do?
- We're fucked!

01:06:50.555 --> 01:06:51.382
Move!

01:06:57.584 --> 01:06:58.732
Open the door!

01:07:02.616 --> 01:07:05.019
- Come on, Tim.  Come on.
- I'm trying!

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:06.200
- Hurry up!
- Run!

01:07:10.108 --> 01:07:12.943
Come on!  Come on!
Go!

01:07:16.959 --> 01:07:18.843
- Come on.
- Fuck it here, Tim.

01:07:18.844 --> 01:07:19.822
Oh my God!

01:07:22.131 --> 01:07:25.175
- Oh fuck!
- Stay down!

01:07:25.809 --> 01:07:26.876
Fuck!

01:07:33.290 --> 01:07:37.579
Dirty!  Dirty! ....

01:07:44.105 --> 01:07:49.455
Dirty! Dirty, dirty, ...

01:07:49.490 --> 01:07:51.471
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

01:07:51.472 --> 01:07:57.612
Welcome to a special show
that is ultimately dirty.

01:07:57.655 --> 01:08:01.150
But first, a little word
about health and safety.

01:08:01.151 --> 01:08:05.829
You've all got your goggles.  I want you
all to put them on now like your eyes.

01:08:09.695 --> 01:08:12.175
Fine.
That's good.

01:08:12.491 --> 01:08:14.563
Let's crack 'em, baby, shall we?

01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:28.768
Let's see if the
old girl still works.

01:08:38.242 --> 01:08:42.823
Right then. Who wants this
hookah, man?  You or your mule?

01:08:43.372 --> 01:08:48.118
What about you, sir?
This hook you?

01:08:52.902 --> 01:08:55.765
Ooh, did someone
do a rotten today?

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:59.675
What is there lallu?
Stick you over the arse?

01:08:59.676 --> 01:09:03.666
Ooh, you're dirty, aren't ya.
Alright ya?

01:09:03.667 --> 01:09:06.575
Say "aye" dirty girl.

01:09:09.384 --> 01:09:15.437
- Heh.  Who wants this up them ass?
- He wants!

01:09:16.081 --> 01:09:18.526
- Who dude?
- He wants!

01:09:18.627 --> 01:09:21.341
- Who dude?
- He wants.

01:09:28.282 --> 01:09:30.649
This pretty young
fella here then, ah!

01:09:37.684 --> 01:09:43.140
Your fucking animals!
Fuck you!  You cunts!

01:09:43.142 --> 01:09:46.054
- Well, you've got a dirty mouth, eh?
- Fuck you!

01:09:46.178 --> 01:09:51.194
- Oh, I'll soon sort you out.
- Fuck you!

01:09:53.924 --> 01:09:55.607
Come on, maybe out of your seats.

01:09:58.415 --> 01:10:01.048
We don't want no
more trouble now, do we?

01:10:03.536 --> 01:10:05.366
No!
Stop it!

01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:14.810
Oh, I can smell ya.

01:10:16.155 --> 01:10:17.671
Now, won't we?

01:10:21.723 --> 01:10:22.807
I warning you!

01:10:22.808 --> 01:10:27.529
You'll be in shit like your
main partner.  Now come on out!

01:10:37.527 --> 01:10:41.566
I'll be having ya.  I swear.
I'll be having ya.

01:10:43.136 --> 01:10:44.752
Oh booger!

01:10:46.187 --> 01:10:47.510
Get out, push him off!

01:10:49.330 --> 01:10:52.638
Oh fuck!
Oh Jesus!

01:11:08.941 --> 01:11:15.213
- It's fucking stuck.
- Alright, going 1, 2, 3. Push!

01:11:15.514 --> 01:11:18.219
Come on.  Quick!

01:11:26.306 --> 01:11:28.730
- Where is he then?
- Who?

01:11:28.731 --> 01:11:31.203
Who! You lumpy stupid, Gris.
Where is he?

01:11:31.204 --> 01:11:35.803
He went after the others.
Don't worry, he's got his gun, though.

01:11:35.838 --> 01:11:36.901
Going after who?

01:11:37.244 --> 01:11:42.307
Outsiders.  When they got
away and went off beyond.

01:11:42.426 --> 01:11:45.596
For fuck sake,
why didn't you tell me?

01:11:45.631 --> 01:11:50.017
He didn't want to stop the show.
But he's got his gun, though.

01:11:50.018 --> 01:11:52.233
- Fucking, cracking powder. It must be ...
- Fuck off!

01:11:52.234 --> 01:11:53.280
Sue me, Jim!

01:12:34.441 --> 01:12:39.794
Hell!  Wren, get moving your
udder, give him your Podge.

01:12:53.463 --> 01:12:59.449
- There is nobody there.
- Right.  We've got work to do, lads.

01:12:59.684 --> 01:13:03.987
They won't get far.
Twenty traps laid around these parts.

01:13:04.222 --> 01:13:07.296
- They won't leave.
- They never do.

01:13:16.322 --> 01:13:18.010
Hey!  Where the fuck are we going?

01:13:18.011 --> 01:13:20.516
- We're going back to the cottage.
- No!  We're not going back.

01:13:20.551 --> 01:13:22.784
There's nothing else we can do, Sam.
We've got to go back.

01:13:22.885 --> 01:13:24.858
Kate, I'm sorry.
But I just meant to.

01:13:24.893 --> 01:13:26.269
Well, maybe that's
what they'll think.

01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:29.841
We need the maps and we need the phones.
We need to tell someone where we are.

01:13:30.022 --> 01:13:32.224
Can you just get us
out of here, please?

01:13:32.225 --> 01:13:34.029
Sam, that's what
I'm trying to do.

01:13:34.803 --> 01:13:35.954
Come on!

01:13:56.762 --> 01:13:59.811
Alright, listen to me.
We need to be quick.

01:13:59.812 --> 01:14:02.375
We need to look for
the phones and the map.

01:14:02.410 --> 01:14:04.670
They are in here somewhere.
I don't know where Jeff put them.

01:14:04.671 --> 01:14:08.304
I need to look everywhere, okay.
I'm going to check all the stairs.

01:14:08.697 --> 01:14:12.062
Look, Sam here, you can ...
I'm gonna check the kitchen, okay?

01:14:33.297 --> 01:14:35.840
Where are all the phones, Jeff?

01:14:47.150 --> 01:14:48.834
Got the maps,
did you find the phones?

01:14:48.835 --> 01:14:51.367
They're not in any, Kate.  We looked
everywhere.  What's in that room?

01:14:51.493 --> 01:14:54.115
That room's have been fucking
locked since we got here, Tim!

01:14:54.227 --> 01:14:54.927
They are here.

01:14:54.928 --> 01:14:57.531
I know they're in because Jeff put
them in a bag and hid them somewhere.

01:14:57.532 --> 01:14:58.780
Now we're not looking properly.

01:14:58.811 --> 01:15:01.965
- Did you try the dining room?
- Just long in that.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.737
Well, let's look again, shall we!
Fuck it!

01:15:10.897 --> 01:15:15.098
- I can't find anything!
- Kate!  We're scared!

01:15:15.433 --> 01:15:17.775
We can't be able to get
caught like the others, do we?

01:15:17.776 --> 01:15:21.978
I'm scared, Tim!
I'm scared, scared, scared!

01:15:22.113 --> 01:15:25.549
We need to phone the police, we
need to tell somebody that we're here.

01:15:25.684 --> 01:15:27.261
They're coming for us.
They've got guns.

01:15:27.362 --> 01:15:29.173
Otherwise, we're dead.
Do you understand?

01:15:29.208 --> 01:15:32.465
Why don't we just go now?
Kate, please.  We've got the maps.

01:15:34.735 --> 01:15:37.179
Listen.  I'm going to
check outside in the barn.

01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:39.464
You need to look at the
map and see where we are.

01:15:39.465 --> 01:15:41.797
I'll be back in a
second and join the family.

01:15:46.583 --> 01:15:47.521
Good evening.

01:15:48.356 --> 01:15:50.915
I reckon my first blood lads.

01:15:54.357 --> 01:15:58.751
Yeah.  And it
will be fi fy if I go.

01:15:59.478 --> 01:16:03.544
Well, next we've got the north,
they said they want to go...

01:16:03.545 --> 01:16:06.253
Fi fy if I go.

01:16:07.474 --> 01:16:11.506
They pulled down father's checks,
and chopped off all his legs...

01:16:11.507 --> 01:16:14.547
Fi fy if I go.

01:16:15.508 --> 01:16:19.314
They took his dirty wife,
and buried her alive...

01:16:19.315 --> 01:16:22.079
Fi fy if I go.

01:16:23.287 --> 01:16:27.387
They took all dirty kids,
and fed them to the pigs ...

01:16:27.388 --> 01:16:30.584
Fi fy if I go.

01:16:36.334 --> 01:16:37.728
Shit!

01:16:37.763 --> 01:16:39.895
Kate, we need more bullets.

01:16:41.346 --> 01:16:42.907
- Where are they?
- They're in there.

01:16:49.158 --> 01:16:51.361
Ron, we need
ammunition up here, now.

01:16:54.150 --> 01:16:57.158
- Here you are, Jim.
- Swap with him.

01:16:57.391 --> 01:16:59.355
Rats, with me, now.

01:17:01.738 --> 01:17:04.850
- Alright go on.
- What?

01:17:05.703 --> 01:17:09.558
- I'll get you half a dozen pints in.
- Alright!

01:17:15.367 --> 01:17:16.926
Go on, lad.

01:17:22.946 --> 01:17:28.091
- Oh!  That looks painful.
- No, please.

01:17:32.125 --> 01:17:33.678
Fuck you!

01:17:39.856 --> 01:17:41.048
Blasted!

01:17:45.479 --> 01:17:47.807
Jim, help me.

01:17:49.016 --> 01:17:50.110
Let if out.

01:17:50.745 --> 01:17:55.034
You got us by our knockers.
What are you gonna do now, eh?

01:17:55.537 --> 01:18:01.357
There's a lot of us.  For miles around.
Not many of you, not around here.

01:18:01.492 --> 01:18:05.011
You won't make a blime if you
ever give a pull that trigger.

01:18:05.146 --> 01:18:09.034
He won't miss him if you blow him off.
Quiet dope.

01:18:09.669 --> 01:18:13.392
Why waste your rounds
on tittlers like him?

01:18:13.427 --> 01:18:17.756
When you could be bugging where
have him beauties like me, eh?

01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:26.887
That's good.
I need you to stay still, Sam.

01:18:27.981 --> 01:18:29.955
Be still, be still.

01:18:35.431 --> 01:18:39.795
- It's gonna be alright.  Come on.
- How many more?

01:18:39.797 --> 01:18:40.928
Keep one.

01:18:45.642 --> 01:18:49.598
That's it!
That's all.

01:18:52.034 --> 01:18:54.757
- Thank you.
- That's alright.

01:19:14.532 --> 01:19:15.929
You're okay.

01:19:19.786 --> 01:19:21.270
It's okay.
It's alright.

01:19:22.583 --> 01:19:23.205
I know.

01:19:28.993 --> 01:19:34.123
- Look after him.  What a way to go.
- I'll bet.

01:19:35.550 --> 01:19:41.186
Poor old Rats.  Quickest too short
lungs suffered down in records.

01:19:42.332 --> 01:19:48.403
Hey!  Come on, you dirty bastards!
Come on!

01:19:54.330 --> 01:19:57.836
- 5 along 40 yards.
- Come on!

01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:01.681
10 on 50.

01:20:04.072 --> 01:20:07.926
- Right, play on.
- Come on, you fuckers!

01:20:08.648 --> 01:20:09.989
Come on!

01:20:12.207 --> 01:20:13.303
Come on.

01:20:19.964 --> 01:20:22.780
Oh fuck!
Fuck!

01:20:22.789 --> 01:20:27.865
Well, you jummy bastard.  1 leg
another 15 yards.  Double or nought.

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:30.204
- 1 leg?
- Right.

01:20:34.222 --> 01:20:38.327
- You, are you alright, are you?
- Oh yeah Podge, it's that last break.

01:20:40.162 --> 01:20:45.733
- What if she loses?
- Leg.  Only one mine.

01:20:50.025 --> 01:20:51.929
Let's get it over.
Come on.

01:21:01.968 --> 01:21:03.966
It's alright.

01:21:05.049 --> 01:21:06.137
You're okay.

01:21:24.781 --> 01:21:28.191
No!  Stop!
Fuck!

01:21:33.453 --> 01:21:35.123
Glad you're on, Podge.

01:21:48.448 --> 01:21:53.111
- You might know what I told ya.
- Yeah, she's proper feisty that one.

01:21:56.144 --> 01:21:59.399
There she goes.
Come on, lass.

01:22:04.406 --> 01:22:07.342
- What are they doing?
- I don't know.

01:22:11.861 --> 01:22:13.369
I'm leaving with a
golden bullet left here.

01:22:15.650 --> 01:22:17.192
I'm going to try that other room.

01:22:17.493 --> 01:22:21.603
Stay and keep watch, okay.
It's going to be alright.

01:22:23.197 --> 01:22:24.222
Tim.

01:22:47.311 --> 01:22:51.680
Sam!  There is a staircase down
here, leading down to the cellar.

01:22:51.684 --> 01:22:55.372
But I'm going to check it out alright.
Stay there and keep watch.

01:23:17.783 --> 01:23:23.970
Dear Lord, who art
in heaven, and hell.

01:23:24.174 --> 01:23:26.022
You had their momma worried.

01:23:26.023 --> 01:23:31.752
He was right little shit hole, man bull.
Deep down he was a good man.

01:23:32.566 --> 01:23:34.262
Loved his greens.

01:23:34.818 --> 01:23:36.403
All they said these vegetables.

01:23:36.404 --> 01:23:43.035
You remember the day .... cheesenuts.
Being bowl of broccoli no butter ...

01:23:44.429 --> 01:23:46.454
You are my son.

01:23:54.107 --> 01:23:57.035
Amen.

01:24:03.851 --> 01:24:04.871
Tim!

01:24:19.843 --> 01:24:22.307
Sam.  There's answers.

01:24:22.508 --> 01:24:25.159
These fucking galleys are booze and vodka.

01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:29.847
Look, the point I'm getting at is,
I'll call store.dot.lights.

01:24:30.648 --> 01:24:36.666
It's the fire exits.
I got privity here.

01:24:41.957 --> 01:24:44.095
Look.  We don't want
any more trouble okay?

01:24:44.496 --> 01:24:46.995
Nor I.  Prove it.

01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:52.734
Well.

01:24:56.339 --> 01:24:57.368
Greg, come over here.

01:24:58.492 --> 01:25:00.155
You all right?
I'm pretty good.

01:25:06.982 --> 01:25:08.042
Well?

01:25:10.724 --> 01:25:12.062
It's safe, Jim.

01:25:25.494 --> 01:25:31.118
- You found it.
- Away, lads.  It'll be alright.

01:25:31.119 --> 01:25:35.296
They are down here.
Greg, on with you.

01:26:11.865 --> 01:26:14.791
What the bloody hell has
been going on down here?

01:26:14.792 --> 01:26:17.667
Stay there.  No closer.

01:26:18.498 --> 01:26:20.661
Don't you dare fucking move!

01:26:21.086 --> 01:26:25.473
Careful, son.  A lot of broken
glass.  You'll cut yourself.

01:26:26.090 --> 01:26:27.424
Put your weapons down.

01:26:27.825 --> 01:26:31.132
Been having a bit of a
shindig down here, don't ya?

01:26:31.762 --> 01:26:35.103
Not me.
The party just beginning.

01:26:35.722 --> 01:26:37.622
Now put your weapons down.

01:26:41.055 --> 01:26:45.665
Podge, put it down.
Put it down.

01:26:49.312 --> 01:26:53.873
I know what you all are thinking.
Would I kill myself?

01:26:54.521 --> 01:26:58.461
I don't know.
Would you?

01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:00.102
You know how they gamble?

01:27:00.303 --> 01:27:04.663
Well, we lost a
little bit shape lately.

01:27:05.282 --> 01:27:09.298
Yeah?  But its about to
get more fucking worse.

01:27:09.872 --> 01:27:11.991
Time to turn on the heat.

01:27:16.483 --> 01:27:21.391
- Oh fuck!
- You're cold lad?

01:27:21.407 --> 01:27:24.558
I don't understand me.
Alcohol should burn.

01:27:25.255 --> 01:27:29.730
No. No, no.  That's
watered down piss, lad.

01:27:29.842 --> 01:27:33.437
Wouldn't give it to me
missus, God rest her soul.

01:27:33.556 --> 01:27:37.204
We make a good brew bucket
in the mill up there.  Ain't it a treat.

01:27:37.305 --> 01:27:39.572
Fuck!
Come on!

01:27:40.248 --> 01:27:41.788
Get on, Podge.

01:27:41.889 --> 01:27:46.026
Come on son, let's
get this sorted out.

01:27:54.437 --> 01:27:57.619
Fuck you!
Fuck you, cunt!

01:27:58.682 --> 01:28:03.343
Fucker!
No!  No!

01:28:19.795 --> 01:28:22.081
No!  Please!

01:28:27.673 --> 01:28:32.491
- What are the odds?
- The trap's favourite.  Evens.

01:28:32.526 --> 01:28:36.196
Pit 3 to 1.
Tripwire, 7 to 1.

01:28:36.304 --> 01:28:40.518
My mine's outsider.
15 to 1.

01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:45.755
- 10 on land mine.
- You throwing it away again, Jim.

01:29:22.513 --> 01:29:25.253
No!  No!

01:29:26.013 --> 01:29:27.344
Fucking bugger.

01:29:27.345 --> 01:29:30.010
About the time me luck changed.

01:29:33.069 --> 01:29:37.113
- Oh well.  A pint?
- Alright!

01:29:56.865 --> 01:30:00.324
<i>Let me tell thee all,
the fate that did befall...</i>

01:30:00.325 --> 01:30:03.081
<i>Fi fy fi fy go.</i>

01:30:04.630 --> 01:30:08.469
<i>When outsiders came
and tried to stake a claim ...</i>

01:30:08.470 --> 01:30:12.090
<i>Fi fy fi fy go.</i>
