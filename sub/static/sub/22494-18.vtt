00:18.184 --> 00:20.790
It's alive!

00:38.371 --> 00:40.612
In a survival situation,
you can find water

00:40.673 --> 00:43.483
inside of a cactus.

00:49.949 --> 00:52.725
Oh, I just can't
figure this thing out

00:52.786 --> 00:55.266
What's a VDV anyway?

00:55.321 --> 00:57.323
How about now, grandma?
- Oh, I see.

00:57.390 --> 00:59.529
This is the port
for the HDMI jack,

00:59.592 --> 01:02.232
not the output for the coaxial
cable interface.

01:02.295 --> 01:03.205
Right it is.

01:03.263 --> 01:05.539
From the makers of
Guitar Hero comes a new game

01:05.598 --> 01:08.238
where the fun just
Didgeree-don't stop!

01:08.301 --> 01:11.441
Get ready
for Didgeree-doo Hero.

01:11.504 --> 01:13.916
Rock amazing concerts on the sun
swept planes of Australia...

01:17.777 --> 01:21.884
Blow that didge!
You're the best dude!

01:21.948 --> 01:23.825
Master the art of Didgeridoo

01:23.883 --> 01:26.261
to classics like,
"Oh Ho the Banyan Tree,"

01:26.319 --> 01:28.799
"That's Not A Knife," and
Metallica's "Enter Sandman."

01:32.959 --> 01:35.701
Order now and get a free tube
of Aborigine Face paint

01:35.762 --> 01:37.901
made from Iron Ore
and Duck Droppings.

01:42.235 --> 01:44.340
Go Buy Didgeridoo Hero!

01:44.404 --> 01:47.578
Anyone can Didgeridoo it!

01:47.640 --> 01:50.348
Send in the next candidate
for building the bomb.

01:50.410 --> 01:54.017
Great Scott!
My name is Doctor Emmett Brown.

01:54.080 --> 01:55.354
My resume is in here
somewhere...

01:55.415 --> 01:59.124
Attended MIT. Inventor.
Professor.

01:59.185 --> 02:01.495
It says here you're inventing
a time machine?

02:01.554 --> 02:04.091
Not to worry,
it doesn't run on plutonium.

02:04.157 --> 02:07.070
Definitely don't need
plutonium for the time machine.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.232
Your crazy hair
makes you look smart.

02:09.294 --> 02:12.538
Like Einstein.
Ahhh hahahaha.

02:12.599 --> 02:14.340
But Einstein was a Jew!

02:14.400 --> 02:18.439
That's why I named the dog
Einstein.

02:18.505 --> 02:19.506
Oh, that's good.

02:19.572 --> 02:22.075
I've actually been sending
Einstein on some trial runs

02:22.142 --> 02:24.122
in the time machine
that needs plutonium...

02:24.177 --> 02:25.713
doesn't need plutonium.

02:25.778 --> 02:28.122
I don't have a time machine.

02:28.181 --> 02:31.185
Now lemme ask you a question
about the plutonium.

02:31.251 --> 02:34.425
Can it fit in the engine valve
of a 1982 DeLorean?

02:34.487 --> 02:36.160
I like this guy.

02:36.222 --> 02:37.758
I have a good feeling
about him too.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.064
Congratulations.

02:39.125 --> 02:41.162
We have chosen you
to build the bomb.

02:41.227 --> 02:43.298
Great, lemme just
get that plutonium

02:43.363 --> 02:46.207
and I'll be back in five
minutes with your bomb.

02:47.534 --> 02:51.311
And here you go,
here's your bomb.

02:51.371 --> 02:52.941
Nice working with you guys.
See you later.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.452
Hey, this looks exactly like
the pinball machine

02:55.508 --> 02:56.782
from the staff lounge.

02:56.843 --> 02:58.049
Damn it!

02:58.111 --> 03:01.581
Let it be known
that I died for your...

03:01.648 --> 03:03.889
Whoa. Whoaaa...

03:03.950 --> 03:06.521
You're not like other boys,
Edward.

03:06.586 --> 03:09.692
That's because I'm actually
109 years old.

03:09.756 --> 03:12.669
And all that time, I've been
waiting for you, Bella.

03:12.725 --> 03:15.262
Oh!

03:17.830 --> 03:22.404
Uh, do you know
the speed limit's like 65?

03:22.468 --> 03:25.005
Do you know that every time you
get behind the wheel of a car

03:25.071 --> 03:28.018
you're driving a lethal weapon?

03:28.074 --> 03:30.486
I love you.

03:32.946 --> 03:35.893
Bella says you've got
crazy powers. That true?

03:35.949 --> 03:39.726
Sure is.
Try this on for size.

03:39.786 --> 03:41.265
Whoa! Two bits!

03:41.321 --> 03:42.891
You should be an accountant.

03:42.956 --> 03:46.335
You've got a real head
for money.

03:46.392 --> 03:48.394
And the bishop was
charged with statutory rape,

03:48.461 --> 03:50.304
due to the girl's young age.

03:50.363 --> 03:53.401
Ugh.
Isn't that so disgusting?

03:53.466 --> 03:54.706
Meh.

03:54.767 --> 03:56.974
I bet he eats dinner at 4:00.

03:57.036 --> 04:00.040
Cut it out, Molly!
You're ruining it!

04:00.106 --> 04:01.915
Hello, I'm Lady Gaga.

04:01.975 --> 04:04.819
Are you sick of boring,
run-of-the-mill babysitters?

04:04.877 --> 04:07.824
Then maybe it's time
for Goo Goo Gaga,

04:07.880 --> 04:11.350
the premiere avant-garde
baby-sitting service from Gaga.

04:11.417 --> 04:14.421
The evening's entertainment
begins with song, dance,

04:14.487 --> 04:16.558
and tribal masks.

04:16.623 --> 04:18.500
When you return home,
you'll find your baby

04:18.558 --> 04:21.402
sleeping soundly...
dangling from the ceiling...

04:21.461 --> 04:23.737
covered in menstrual blood.

04:23.796 --> 04:27.175
I'm wearing a diaper made
of dirty angel farts.

04:27.233 --> 04:30.180
Oooh la la.
Goo Goo Gaga.

04:30.236 --> 04:33.683
There are sides of me that
you'll never understand.

04:33.740 --> 04:36.983
More of your favorite fried
Pterodactyl, Fred?

04:37.043 --> 04:38.021
Yabba dabba...

04:38.077 --> 04:40.353
Yes or no.

04:42.682 --> 04:46.129
Hello, I am the Great Gazoo!

04:46.185 --> 04:48.722
Aaaaaaaaaah! It's a god!

04:48.788 --> 04:50.597
It's a green god!!!

04:50.657 --> 04:52.864
H-Here, take her!
Take my wife!

04:52.925 --> 04:55.906
P-Please, there are children
present.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.669
He wants our children!

04:57.730 --> 04:59.334
Forgive me, Betty!

04:59.399 --> 05:02.346
Whoa, whoa,
I'm no Roman Polanski.

05:02.402 --> 05:07.317
Then, let this animal sacrifice
appease your holy rage!

05:10.743 --> 05:13.246
I... I just wanted to go on
adventures...

05:13.313 --> 05:14.724
Our God is weak!

05:14.781 --> 05:15.885
Kill it! Kill it!!!!!

05:18.318 --> 05:19.695
What an unfitting end

05:19.752 --> 05:22.164
for such an important
peripheral character!

05:22.221 --> 05:23.723
Yabba dabba fuck you!

05:36.969 --> 05:39.006
You ever notice
how red bone marrow

05:39.072 --> 05:41.609
performs
hematopoiesis like this.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.347
Oh, I'm eating a little bit
of blood.

05:43.409 --> 05:46.083
I'll have a little of that.

05:46.145 --> 05:50.059
But brown bone marrow performs
hematopoiesis like this!

05:56.356 --> 05:58.859
Chuck! It's your cousin
Marvin Berry!

05:58.925 --> 06:00.927
You know that new sound
you've been looking for?

06:00.993 --> 06:02.802
Well listen to this!

06:02.862 --> 06:04.500
That's Johnny B Good...

06:04.564 --> 06:06.009
I just laid it down last week!

06:06.065 --> 06:08.272
Motherfucker stole my song!
Keep him there!

06:08.334 --> 06:10.678
I'm 15 minutes away!

06:10.737 --> 06:13.581
Chuck!
You gonna pee on me or what?

06:13.639 --> 06:16.210
And if one of your kids
accidentally sets fire

06:16.275 --> 06:17.879
to the living room rug...

06:17.944 --> 06:20.151
Who's the motherfucker been
stealin' my songs?!

06:20.213 --> 06:21.487
Chuck Berry?!

06:21.547 --> 06:23.254
How the fuck do you know
my name, man?!

06:23.316 --> 06:25.318
You're only one of the biggest
rock stars in history...

06:25.385 --> 06:27.865
Oh, really...

06:27.920 --> 06:30.093
Oh, hey there.

06:30.156 --> 06:32.534
How you doin', young lady?

06:35.828 --> 06:39.298
All right!

06:39.365 --> 06:41.902
Oy, my tuchas!

06:41.968 --> 06:43.948
Ethel! Ethel!

06:44.003 --> 06:47.416
Oh Shlomo, Shlomol
You won't believe this tsurras!

06:47.473 --> 06:50.079
We've got moths!

06:50.143 --> 06:52.521
Oy... vey?

06:55.481 --> 06:57.518
Are you a dog?

06:57.583 --> 06:59.927
How many times has this
happened to you?

06:59.986 --> 07:02.694
You're out on the street.
Then a dog you know walks by.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.996
But before you can finish
your conversation,

07:05.057 --> 07:07.594
your owner drags you away.

07:07.660 --> 07:09.162
Not anymore.

07:09.228 --> 07:12.175
Veringular announces
the new DogPhone.

07:29.615 --> 07:30.787
And that's not all.

07:30.850 --> 07:33.330
DogPhone now comes
with free Voicemail.

07:33.386 --> 07:36.367
You have 37 messages.

07:41.060 --> 07:43.631
Veringular.
Bringing dogs together.

07:53.806 --> 07:56.844
Not so fucking smart now,
are we?

07:56.909 --> 07:59.219
I am going baaaaack to the sea.

07:59.278 --> 08:02.225
Back to the sea!

08:06.919 --> 08:10.093
Great Scott!
I'm all out of plutonium.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.635
How am I ever going to generate

08:11.691 --> 08:13.602
enough Gigawatts
to get home again?

08:13.659 --> 08:15.468
Great Scott!

08:15.528 --> 08:17.599
