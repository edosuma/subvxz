Congratulations
on turning in your creative
writing assignments.

00:10.500 --> 00:12.119
Most of you.

00:12.120 --> 00:15.329
Challenging your imaginations
makes you better thinkers.

00:15.330 --> 00:17.919
Better thinkers
are better scientists.

00:17.920 --> 00:20.419
Or this stuff keeps us
from actual science.

00:20.420 --> 00:23.539
A strong opinion from
and uninformed source.

00:23.540 --> 00:27.079
Karmi, would you please
read the first chapter
of your story?

00:27.080 --> 00:31.329
Of course. I'm always
happy to inspire
the underachievers.

00:31.330 --> 00:32.539
(mutters, groans)

00:32.540 --> 00:35.289
By the time Big Hero 6

00:35.290 --> 00:39.329
knew the evil Momakase
had lured them into a trap,

00:39.330 --> 00:41.879
it was too late.

00:41.880 --> 00:45.379
-It's a trap!
-But we realized it too late.

00:45.380 --> 00:48.419
The city is mine now, heroes.

00:48.420 --> 00:51.789
I never got to tell
my beautiful girlfriend,
Karmi, how I felt.

00:51.790 --> 00:55.289
There, there. She knew.
She's very smart.

00:55.290 --> 00:57.960
She is! And she's here
to save you.

00:59.710 --> 01:01.579
Who are you?

01:01.580 --> 01:05.289
Didn't you hear us?
She's Captain Cutie's
beautiful girlfriend, Karmi.

01:05.290 --> 01:07.539
Yes. I will play it back
for you.

01:07.540 --> 01:09.249
Beautiful girlfriend--
Beautiful girlfriend--

01:09.250 --> 01:10.499
-Beautiful--
-Enough!

01:10.500 --> 01:12.499
And how do you plan
to stop me?

01:12.500 --> 01:16.879
I designed a device
to reverse the polarity
of your evil vortex.

01:16.880 --> 01:19.329
(sighs)
She's the best.

01:19.330 --> 01:21.209
Ugh! No way.

01:21.210 --> 01:23.619
-Problem, weirdo?
-Yeah. A whole list of them.

01:23.620 --> 01:27.499
Instead of criticism,
might I suggest creation?

01:27.500 --> 01:30.919
Have fun staring at a blank
computer screen all night.

01:30.920 --> 01:32.459
You wish.

02:22.750 --> 02:24.079
-It's--
-Shiny!

02:24.080 --> 02:26.289
What's that do? And that?
And that? And that?

(chuckles) Okay.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.380
Um...

02:36.710 --> 02:38.919
-Give me a hint.
-Maybe I could actually
get work done

02:38.920 --> 02:41.039
if you were somewhere else.

02:41.040 --> 02:43.079
-Not much of a hint.
-Take this hint.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.829
Go! Anywhere but here.

02:45.830 --> 02:47.959
Make yourself useful.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.329
(dejectedly):
Okeydoke.

02:50.330 --> 02:53.709
...suddenly went
completely black.

02:53.710 --> 02:55.289
Okay, Baymax,
now play that back.

02:55.290 --> 02:57.619
Hiro (on recording):
As the concentration shifted,

02:57.620 --> 03:02.790
the chemical clock reaction
suddenly went completely black.

03:04.040 --> 03:04.880
I don't get it.

03:04.881 --> 03:06.119
It's a scary story.

03:06.120 --> 03:08.079
A chemically accurate
scary story.

03:08.080 --> 03:10.499
Accuracy does not
equal entertainment.

03:10.500 --> 03:12.789
It's not "accur-tainment."

03:12.790 --> 03:15.169
-(groans) Baymax, erase it.
-All of it?

03:15.170 --> 03:17.919
Yeah, go ahead and erase
every bit of that. Super boring.

03:17.920 --> 03:20.499
-Yeah, well, he's right.
-Baymax: (beeps) Deleted.

03:20.500 --> 03:24.079
Science-horror might be
too advanced for your
first work of fiction.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.619
Maybe write what you know.

03:25.620 --> 03:27.669
All I know is
I hate writing.

03:27.670 --> 03:31.169
Ooh! Writing about
how you hate writing
would be like meta.

03:31.170 --> 03:32.619
Super meta!

03:32.620 --> 03:35.079
-Go Go (over radio):
Sounds like you're avoiding it.
-I am not avoiding it.

03:35.080 --> 03:36.749
Aah!

03:36.750 --> 03:38.169
Yup. Avoiding it.

03:38.170 --> 03:41.169
Hey, maybe reading
Karmi's latest work
would spark something.

03:41.170 --> 03:42.919
I mean,
it's got everything:

03:42.920 --> 03:46.249
action, adventure,
suspense, us!

03:46.250 --> 03:48.499
That's it. I know us.

03:48.500 --> 03:50.169
I'll write a Big Hero 6 story.

03:50.170 --> 03:53.879
-Isn't that what she did?
-Well, yeah.
But mine will be, um...

03:53.880 --> 03:55.709
-Baymax:
Scientifically accurate.
-Better.

03:55.710 --> 03:57.169
Interesting.

03:57.170 --> 04:00.829
An AU-- that stands
for "Alternate Universe,"
for you fanfic newbies--

04:00.830 --> 04:05.079
inside of another AU
is the perfect amount of AU!

04:05.080 --> 04:07.289
Right? Well, what do
you think Baymax?

04:07.290 --> 04:10.379
-(beeping)
-I think there's a disturbance
at Night Market Square.

04:10.380 --> 04:13.039
-Let's move out.
-This conversation is TBC.

04:13.040 --> 04:16.170
-That sounds for
"to be conti"-- Okay!
-Yeah.

04:22.080 --> 04:23.539
Hiro:
Noodle Burger Boy.

04:23.540 --> 04:26.379
Perhaps these parts will fill
the emptiness inside of me.

04:26.380 --> 04:28.079
Is he okay?

04:28.080 --> 04:30.120
Whatever. Move in.

04:32.420 --> 04:35.539
Great. Happy,
hyperactive heroes.

04:35.540 --> 04:36.919
Awesome.

04:36.920 --> 04:38.420
Aah!

04:45.120 --> 04:47.960
Existence in an endless void.

04:50.460 --> 04:54.379
Is it just me or is
Noodle Burger Boy
kinda... OOC?

04:54.380 --> 04:57.249
(sighs) Fine.
What does that stand for?

04:57.250 --> 04:59.169
"Out of character."
Come on!

04:59.170 --> 05:00.249
Hiro:
I can fix that.

05:00.250 --> 05:01.290
Baymax, power kick!

05:05.000 --> 05:06.290
Typical me.

05:07.290 --> 05:08.749
Give it up,
Noodle Burger Boy!

05:08.750 --> 05:12.079
Failure is the inevitable
result of effort.

05:12.080 --> 05:14.249
Uh... okay.

05:14.250 --> 05:15.749
So, you... you surrender?

05:15.750 --> 05:18.749
Why not? My day
can't get any worse.

05:18.750 --> 05:20.460
(creaking)

05:26.170 --> 05:28.709
I can't believe it.
He's gone.

05:28.710 --> 05:31.039
Taken out by a flying billboard.

05:31.040 --> 05:33.379
Baymax:
Fred, it was
a falling billboard.

05:33.380 --> 05:35.419
There, there.

05:35.420 --> 05:38.539
(sniffles) Goodbye,
Noodle Burger buddy...

05:38.540 --> 05:40.829
who was also
a Noodle Burger adversary.

05:40.830 --> 05:41.999
I will admit that.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.959
-How's the writing going, Hiro?
-Check it out.

05:43.960 --> 05:46.919
Karmi, thinking she could
save Big Hero 6

05:46.920 --> 05:51.579
from Momakase's trap,
was about to fail so much.

05:51.580 --> 05:55.289
I made a shiny thing
to reverse the spinning
sky thing's spinning-ness.

05:55.290 --> 05:58.329
-(fritzes)
-(gasps)

05:58.330 --> 06:00.079
That's so weird.

06:00.080 --> 06:03.669
Hiro: Except it wasn't.
'Cause Karmi's not an
electrical engineer,

06:03.670 --> 06:06.039
and is also the worst.

06:06.040 --> 06:09.119
Luckily, the problem's
obvious.

06:09.120 --> 06:10.619
Backwards regulator.

06:10.620 --> 06:13.210
By the time it's fixed,
it will be far too late.

06:14.790 --> 06:16.170
Fixed it.

06:19.250 --> 06:22.000
You win this time,
Big Hero 6.

06:24.170 --> 06:26.380
I don't know why
I failed so badly.

06:28.330 --> 06:30.249
I can make you a list.

06:30.250 --> 06:32.170
(sighs) Pretty good, right?

06:34.250 --> 06:37.669
Well, if you are open
to taking notes...

06:37.670 --> 06:39.499
That dialogue was
way on the nose.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.289
Plus the main character's
a little unlikable.

06:42.290 --> 06:46.879
Baymax:
Hiro, I am concerned about
your elevated blood pressure.

06:46.880 --> 06:50.289
I think what we all
need to do is to think
about something happier.

06:50.290 --> 06:52.419
Uh, what's happier
than saving the day

06:52.420 --> 06:53.999
and making Karmi look bad?

06:54.000 --> 06:56.170
Well, I do love
a good love story.

06:58.080 --> 07:00.420
Ooh! This is so soothing.

07:02.420 --> 07:05.419
It's great. I just wish
I could have been
more helpful earlier.

07:05.420 --> 07:08.039
Go talk to her about...
you know.

07:08.040 --> 07:10.329
What? No. I don't--

07:10.330 --> 07:12.079
-You know?
-Don't be shy.

07:12.080 --> 07:14.419
You're so tall,
so much taller than
averagely tall me,

07:14.420 --> 07:16.669
and so nice,
so go for it.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.459
Cheer up, Karmi.

07:18.460 --> 07:21.079
Momakase would have had us
if you hadn't shown up.

07:21.080 --> 07:22.829
-But you said--
-I know.

07:22.830 --> 07:24.919
And I was wrong. I'm sorry.

07:24.920 --> 07:27.620
Then why do you act
like you hate me
in front of everyone?

07:30.290 --> 07:33.379
Averagely tall girl just
made me realize the truth.

07:33.380 --> 07:37.960
I've been intimidated
by how much I actually...
like you.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.290
Averagely tall girl
is such a good friend.

07:45.710 --> 07:48.249
-Shh! Quiet.
-Thank you, Go Go.

07:48.250 --> 07:50.789
-There is no way--
-No, not that.

07:50.790 --> 07:52.250
-I heard something.
-(whirring)

07:54.420 --> 07:55.790
Noodle Burger Boy's back!

07:58.080 --> 07:59.330

08:01.710 --> 08:04.419
Salutations and good tidings,
gentlefolk.

Oh, this will do nicely.
Yes, yes, yes.

08:12.540 --> 08:16.000
Oh. (giggles) Put it in.
What do we have here?

08:18.250 --> 08:20.290
-Okay. That's new.

09:16.750 --> 09:18.620
Pretty sure no.

09:20.670 --> 09:23.039
What is with these random
Noodle Burger Boys?

09:23.040 --> 09:25.669
Maybe they time traveled
from the future.

09:25.670 --> 09:26.999
Or the past!

09:35.710 --> 09:37.999
-Honey Lemon: Hiro.
-What? Oh, sorry.

09:51.170 --> 09:52.669

Karmi tried to hide

but it was pointless because
even under mind control,

10:11.170 --> 10:12.789
- Big Hero 6 is too smart--
-Hold on.

10:12.790 --> 10:16.170
Why would someone take control
of us just to go after Karmi?

10:18.040 --> 10:20.209
You're right.
She's not that important.

10:20.210 --> 10:22.209
I just couldn't think
of an actual reason why

10:22.210 --> 10:24.169
fan-fic me would try

10:31.500 --> 10:33.919
Yeah? Well, how would
you do it then?

Oh! I am digging
the minimalist approach.

11:10.710 --> 11:12.619
You are still gonna finish
the story later though, right?

11:12.620 --> 11:14.119
-Definitely not.
-Shh, shh, shh.

11:14.120 --> 11:15.460
No spoilers.

11:21.040 --> 11:22.879
Argh!

11:22.880 --> 11:26.250
What mighty treasures
await me discovery here?

11:27.330 --> 11:30.289
Yo-ho, yo-ho!
Me hearties, yo-ho!

11:30.290 --> 11:33.080
All right. I kind of like
this version.

11:34.170 --> 11:35.959
(yelling)

11:35.960 --> 11:38.119
Noodle Burger Boy:
Laser! Laser!

11:38.120 --> 11:39.249
Laser!

11:39.250 --> 11:40.789
Yeah, I take it back.

11:40.790 --> 11:42.539
Me hearties, yo-ho!

11:42.540 --> 11:45.289
Take that, ya scurvy sea dogs.

11:45.290 --> 11:46.250
What's he after, Baymax?

11:49.210 --> 11:52.079
Baymax:
It appears to be... seafood.

11:52.080 --> 11:53.669
(shudders)
Why seafood?

11:53.670 --> 11:55.420
It doesn't matter.
Let's go.

11:57.580 --> 12:00.209
What be this? Hostiles?

12:00.210 --> 12:02.249
Argh! Laser!

12:02.250 --> 12:03.210
Laser!

12:06.080 --> 12:08.120
(grunting)

12:09.250 --> 12:11.289
Have at ye, bilge rat!

12:11.290 --> 12:14.120
A rotten fool.

12:23.960 --> 12:27.209
Yo-ho, yo-ho, yo-ho!

12:27.210 --> 12:29.670
-Yo-ho!
-Aah!

12:31.750 --> 12:33.420
Argh!

12:35.460 --> 12:39.250
Ah, you think you got me
bettered, you blooming
cockroaches.

12:41.210 --> 12:42.540
(grunts)

12:43.750 --> 12:46.210
Dead men tell no tales.

12:47.290 --> 12:50.040
Why is he hitting me
with a fish?

12:58.580 --> 13:00.539
Blow the man down.

13:00.540 --> 13:02.040
Baymax:
Fred, do not look.

13:06.080 --> 13:08.210
Wow. What are the odds.

13:15.170 --> 13:18.379
So, any theories why
pirate burger boy
was after fish?

13:18.380 --> 13:21.329
Okay, time for a break
from all this thinking.

13:21.330 --> 13:22.419
It's exhausting.

13:22.420 --> 13:24.829
Go Go, I believe you left us
with a cliffhanger.

13:24.830 --> 13:28.459
Nope. I'm done.
Besides, it's not
my assignment.

13:28.460 --> 13:30.329
(sighs) Except I'm still
kind of stuck.

13:30.330 --> 13:32.789
Baymax:
Hiro, if it is acceptable,

13:32.790 --> 13:35.829
I will attempt to continue
your fan fiction.

13:35.830 --> 13:37.419
(giggling)
What?

13:37.420 --> 13:39.209
-Uh, really, Baymax?
-Baymax: Yes.

13:39.210 --> 13:43.329
From my observations,
fan fiction seems to be
an extrapolation

13:43.330 --> 13:46.289
from various instances
of previous behavior.

13:46.290 --> 13:48.379
it is a simulation.

13:48.380 --> 13:51.419
Operating in the dark is
potentially dangerous.

13:51.420 --> 13:55.419
This lab should be used
for scientific purposes only.

13:55.420 --> 13:58.379
These robots require
reprogramming.

13:58.380 --> 14:00.669
We must run
extensive diagnostics.

14:00.670 --> 14:04.539
This will take approximately
10 to 13 hours.

14:04.540 --> 14:06.540
(Baymax beeping)

14:07.750 --> 14:08.999
Huh.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.289
Baymax, it's okay to skip
past the boring parts.

14:12.290 --> 14:13.920
Oh. Okay.

14:16.540 --> 14:18.669
Your diagnostics
were successful.

14:18.670 --> 14:20.249
Thank you
for your assistance.

14:20.250 --> 14:21.749
I am designed to help.

14:21.750 --> 14:23.539
The end.

14:23.540 --> 14:25.329
-Huh.
-Huh?

14:25.330 --> 14:30.959
That was, um...
very realistic, Baymax.

14:30.960 --> 14:32.499
Thank you, Honey Lemon.

14:32.500 --> 14:35.499
I am open to any constructive
criticism you have.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.789
Well, if you're asking...

14:37.790 --> 14:40.169
You really didn't answer
why anyone would even build

14:40.170 --> 14:41.919
evil robot copies of us
in the first place.

14:41.920 --> 14:43.289
Sounds like Wasabi
has a theory,

14:43.290 --> 14:45.499
which, about time.
It's your turn.

14:45.500 --> 14:48.169
Right, right. What? No.
There are turns?

14:48.170 --> 14:52.209
Wait a minute.
If you're all bots, where's
the real Big Hero 6?

14:52.210 --> 14:55.539
Wasabi:
Little did she know,
Big Hero 6 was waking up

14:55.540 --> 14:58.329
to the surprise
of their lives.

14:58.330 --> 15:02.829
Wow. This is the cleanest room
I've ever been imprisoned in.

15:02.830 --> 15:07.459
Just because we're evil
doesn't mean we're unsanitary.

15:07.460 --> 15:11.419
Thank you. I'm so over
the abandoned warehouses
and subways.

15:11.420 --> 15:13.620
Looking at you
Baron Von Steamer.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.499
So, what are you
gonna do with us?

15:17.500 --> 15:20.379
Now that the city
is distracted by your doubles,

15:20.380 --> 15:22.459
we can do whatever--

15:22.460 --> 15:24.329
Wait. That's it.

15:24.330 --> 15:26.999
So, you're just
taking over then?

15:27.000 --> 15:30.079
Yeah. This is good.
You're gonna do your own
homework now, Hiro.

15:30.080 --> 15:31.379
No, not the story.

15:31.380 --> 15:33.289
I'm talking about the attack
of the Noodle Burger Boys.

15:33.290 --> 15:36.459
-What about them?
-It's just, while we were
distracted by the copies,

15:36.460 --> 15:38.250
what was the original doing?

15:39.920 --> 15:41.330
(woman screams)

15:43.540 --> 15:44.790
Oh, no.

15:46.540 --> 15:49.500
Hee-hee, hee-hee, hee-hee.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.039
Honestly, I'm not sure why
the bad guys

16:00.040 --> 16:02.209
have even taken this long
to steal my Kaiju again.

16:02.210 --> 16:04.710
And honestly, I'm not sure why
you keep rebuilding it.

16:07.960 --> 16:10.619
Give up, Noodle Burger Boy.
You can't stop all six of us.

16:10.620 --> 16:13.039
Howdy and hello, misters!

16:13.040 --> 16:16.079
We are delivering
this 10-ton Kaiju-bun

16:16.080 --> 16:18.119
as a present for our sister.

16:18.120 --> 16:19.920
-Our?
-Hiro, watch out!

16:22.120 --> 16:25.249
Meet my latest model
burger brothers!

16:25.250 --> 16:28.669
They are fresh off the grill.

16:28.670 --> 16:31.999
Sis told me to make
myself useful.

16:32.000 --> 16:37.209
So I made myself
and they are useful!

16:37.210 --> 16:40.210
It's over, Big Hero misters!

16:42.790 --> 16:44.920
Baymax, rocket fist.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.000
What?

16:50.960 --> 16:54.209
Did I mention I had
the exterior reinforced

16:54.210 --> 16:57.539
after the whole
giant-shock-wave-about-
to-destroy-the-city incident?

16:57.540 --> 16:59.080
Baymax:
You did not.

17:04.120 --> 17:05.709
They're so quiet.

17:05.710 --> 17:07.999
-It's a little creepy.
-Hiro: Anyone have
any ideas?

17:08.000 --> 17:10.209
Ooh! I do.
And it goes like this.

17:10.210 --> 17:13.999
As the evil villains
loomed over our heroes...

17:14.000 --> 17:17.419
Now that you're city
is distracted by your doubles,

17:17.420 --> 17:19.209
we can do whatever we want.

17:19.210 --> 17:23.669
Sounds like the plot from
Captain Fancy, issue 252:
"Fancy Squared."

17:23.670 --> 17:25.079
Great issue!

17:25.080 --> 17:26.379
I also love comics.

17:26.380 --> 17:29.249
-Ooh, and we reference them.
-Same.

17:29.250 --> 17:33.539
Baymax:
My algorithms say Fred's
knowledge of pop culture
is totes impressive.

17:33.540 --> 17:38.579
Enough! We all agree
Fred's absolutely
spectacularly amazing,

17:38.580 --> 17:40.120
but we're still finishing you.

17:45.170 --> 17:47.379
What are you doing,
Noodle nincompoop?

17:47.380 --> 17:50.079
In a shocking twist,
I suddenly remembered

17:50.080 --> 17:53.329
my friendship with Fred
from when I was not evil,
mister.

17:53.330 --> 17:55.960
Baymax:
I am a robot.
Robots can do that.

18:01.210 --> 18:03.880
Gee, mister. We're Noodle
Burger buddies again.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.789
Villain redemption story!

18:07.790 --> 18:10.920
♪ ♪

18:17.250 --> 18:19.169
Classic.

18:19.170 --> 18:21.289
And we all lived happily ever--

18:21.290 --> 18:22.790
(grunts)

18:28.580 --> 18:31.919
I meant we need ideas
on how to defeat
Noodle Burger Boy.

18:31.920 --> 18:34.250
Oh! But it was still
a good story, right?

18:35.170 --> 18:37.709
I disagree,
mister fixter.

18:37.710 --> 18:39.919
Man, everyone's a critic.

18:39.920 --> 18:43.039
Fine! How would
you do it, mister?

18:43.040 --> 18:45.039
Hee-hee, hee-hee.

18:45.040 --> 18:47.290
(video rewinding)

18:51.170 --> 18:55.079
Now that the city
is distracted by your doubles,

18:55.080 --> 18:57.210
I can finally defeat you!

18:58.960 --> 19:01.999
But ingenious
and adorable leader,

19:02.000 --> 19:04.209
we've already defeated them.

19:04.210 --> 19:06.170
Not at a dance-off.

19:09.080 --> 19:11.669
Dance is the ultimate
form of battle, misters.

19:11.670 --> 19:13.919
Misters, I do not think
we can win.

19:13.920 --> 19:17.249
Golly, misters.
We can try.

19:17.250 --> 19:20.829
Ready, set, dance!

19:20.830 --> 19:22.419
(funky music playing)

19:22.420 --> 19:24.330
(grunting)

19:28.880 --> 19:30.080
Hee-hee!

19:35.250 --> 19:36.460
Jazz hands!

19:37.750 --> 19:40.330
Wow. He is the superior
mister, misters.

19:41.250 --> 19:42.749
It is-- whoa, whoa!

19:42.750 --> 19:45.540
It is too much for
my dance matrix, mister.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.619
Whoa. Only thing
we can do is join him
as his backup dancers.

19:51.620 --> 19:53.459
Hee-hee, hee-hee.

19:53.460 --> 19:56.249
Hee-hee, hee-hee.

19:56.250 --> 19:57.670
Wow.

19:59.290 --> 20:01.289
My burger brothers!

20:01.290 --> 20:02.499
What happened?

20:02.500 --> 20:04.619
Sorry, we stopped them
during your story.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.879
But we were
still listening, promise.

20:06.880 --> 20:09.379
This isn't over!

20:09.380 --> 20:10.419
I will defeat you.

20:10.420 --> 20:12.579
And I will rebuild!

20:12.580 --> 20:16.249
And I will fix them
with all the fixings!

20:16.250 --> 20:19.289
Hiro:
Forgetting about someone?
Baymax, rocket fist.

20:19.290 --> 20:22.880
Noodle Burger Boy:
This is not swell, mister! Whoa!

20:24.460 --> 20:26.249
(grunting)

20:26.250 --> 20:28.379
Everyone saw that coming.

20:28.380 --> 20:29.500
Am I right?

20:32.460 --> 20:36.710
Guess... what...
I... did... sis!

20:40.000 --> 20:42.039
Playtime's over, little bro.

20:42.040 --> 20:44.579
Time to get serious
about Big Hero 6.

20:44.580 --> 20:47.329
We must avenge father.

20:47.330 --> 20:51.379
And this is how we do it.

20:51.380 --> 20:53.119
It's... so... shiny!

20:53.120 --> 20:54.580
Hee-hee!

20:56.750 --> 21:00.249
Hiro, would you like assistance
with your assignment?

21:00.250 --> 21:03.579
I can run several more
fan fiction simulations.

21:03.580 --> 21:05.539
Uh, no. It's okay,
Baymax.

21:05.540 --> 21:08.669
You know, uh,
everyone's creative styles
are totally different.

21:08.670 --> 21:12.459
I think it's time for me
to try and come up
with something of my own.

21:12.460 --> 21:14.829
Yes. Perhaps
that would be best.

21:14.830 --> 21:17.330
Yeah. And I'm gonna write
from experience.

21:21.250 --> 21:24.579
Ah, your assignment,
Mr. Hamada.

21:24.580 --> 21:29.540
Yeah, it's a story
about a boy,
his brother, and a robot.

21:34.380 --> 21:36.920
(theme music playing)
