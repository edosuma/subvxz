WEBVTT

00:06.273 --> 00:08.117
Here we go!

00:08.141 --> 00:09.752
Nice!

00:09.776 --> 00:10.820
Yeah, man.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.755
Dude, give me another one.

00:12.779 --> 00:14.891
Hey, let me get this.
Let me get this.

00:14.915 --> 00:17.645
He's gonna be
cleaning this up for days.

00:18.437 --> 00:20.330
Hey, hey, somebody's coming!
Run! Run! Run!

00:20.354 --> 00:21.631
Oh, man! Let's go!

00:21.655 --> 00:22.815
I got the bag! Go, go!

00:24.591 --> 00:26.889
Come on, come on,
get down, get down.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.038
Looks like we're clear.

00:29.062 --> 00:30.897
I love Halloween. Me, too.

00:32.698 --> 00:36.613
Hey, isn't that Korby's car?

00:36.637 --> 00:38.114
Sounds like he's rockin' out.

00:38.138 --> 00:39.282
It's late.

00:39.306 --> 00:41.451
GI Jokester must be getting lit
up in there.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.219
You guys thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'?

00:43.243 --> 00:44.821
- Oh, yeah.
- Uh-huh.

00:44.845 --> 00:46.642
Let's crash his party.

00:48.715 --> 00:49.807
Dude, dude.

00:50.851 --> 00:52.895
Is he asleep?

00:52.919 --> 00:55.444
Hey, dude must be
baked out of his mind.

00:58.759 --> 01:01.353
What is this?

01:03.063 --> 01:04.206
He's not smoking.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.096
What?

01:10.570 --> 01:11.638
Mr. Korby?

01:48.150 --> 01:49.651
Now, listen, no gerrymandering.

01:49.676 --> 01:51.921
If I win this thing,
I want to see the money.

01:51.945 --> 01:55.291
That's not
a personal insult, Jerry.

01:55.315 --> 01:58.795
Just keep the competition clean,
you know what I'm sayin'?

01:58.819 --> 02:00.697
You'd better add 42

02:00.721 --> 02:05.835
destruction-of-property, one
arson and, uh, let's make it

02:05.859 --> 02:07.036
two indecent exposures.

02:07.060 --> 02:08.503
That's my final tally.

02:08.527 --> 02:10.506
And I will talk to you tomorrow.

02:10.530 --> 02:11.708
Who was that?

02:11.732 --> 02:14.010
Old buddy of mine
from Baltimore PD.

02:14.034 --> 02:16.846
Doing a little Larceny Lotto.

02:16.870 --> 02:18.014
Larceny Lotto?

02:18.038 --> 02:19.682
It's an old Halloween tradition.

02:19.706 --> 02:21.117
Everyone throws 200 bucks
into the kitty.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.853
Tries to guess the number of
disturbance calls

02:23.877 --> 02:26.456
on Mischief Night, which is
the night before Halloween.

02:26.480 --> 02:29.425
And then, of course,
Halloween itself.

02:29.449 --> 02:30.760
Tony, you hate Halloween.

02:30.784 --> 02:33.429
Anyway, it's a lot of money,
and I like money.

02:33.453 --> 02:35.832
That is why someone kept ringing
my doorbell and running off.

02:35.856 --> 02:38.234
When I was a kid on base
at Alameda,

02:38.258 --> 02:39.469
we called it "Devil's Night."

02:39.493 --> 02:41.337
I remember one year we put the

02:41.361 --> 02:43.206
base commander's bedroom
furniture on a tarmac.

02:43.230 --> 02:45.341
You know it takes less
than a tenth of a second

02:45.365 --> 02:47.543
for the engine of an F-18
to move a BarcaLounger 300 feet.

02:47.567 --> 02:48.544
Good memories.

02:48.568 --> 02:50.513
Ring-N-Runs, Dine-N-Ditch...

02:50.537 --> 02:51.514
Lock-N-Load.

02:51.538 --> 02:52.869
Got a dead Marine.

02:54.574 --> 02:57.144
Agent David, you're driving.

03:01.081 --> 03:03.359
Victim is Marine
Lance Corporal James Korby.

03:03.383 --> 03:05.862
He just got back
from his third tour

03:05.886 --> 03:07.463
of Afghanistan three days ago.

03:07.487 --> 03:08.564
Family?

03:08.588 --> 03:10.399
Lives here with his wife
and stepdaughter.

03:10.423 --> 03:12.535
Local LEOs are trying
to track them down.

03:12.559 --> 03:14.637
No obvious signs
of struggle inside the car.

03:14.661 --> 03:17.573
No blood. Looks like a suicide.

03:17.597 --> 03:21.077
Looks can be deceiving,
Agent David.

03:21.101 --> 03:24.580
There's no way that man killed
himself in that car, Jethro.

03:24.604 --> 03:26.916
Jacking that one up
from beyond the arc, Duck.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.417
I can barely see that far.

03:28.441 --> 03:31.721
Carboxyhemoglobin does not
require closer inspection.

03:31.745 --> 03:35.424
If carbon monoxide had been
the cause of that man's death,

03:35.448 --> 03:37.126
his skin would be cherry red,

03:37.150 --> 03:39.729
which it isn't, ergo...

03:39.753 --> 03:40.963
Body was staged.

03:40.987 --> 03:42.865
To look like a suicide.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.117
Yeah.

03:45.458 --> 03:48.171
Korby lived for Mischief Night.

03:48.195 --> 03:49.972
He was the king
of practical jokes.

03:49.996 --> 03:53.276
I guess that makes you
the Princes of Pranks.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.744
Are we in trouble?

03:54.768 --> 03:56.169
Not unless you killed him.

03:57.537 --> 03:59.215
I'll handle the questions
here, probie. Thank you.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.150
We were talking about Korby.

04:01.174 --> 04:02.652
Guy was awesome.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.987
Came up with new practical jokes
every Halloween.

04:05.011 --> 04:07.590
Nothing dangerous.

04:07.614 --> 04:08.791
I mean, no razor blades.

04:08.815 --> 04:11.794
He'd freeze all kinds of stuff,
blow things up.

04:11.818 --> 04:13.029
It was funny.

04:13.053 --> 04:14.096
And illegal.

04:14.120 --> 04:15.398
And you are?

04:15.422 --> 04:18.000
Ted Rodgers.
Live across the street.

04:18.024 --> 04:19.902
First he drove us crazy
with his pranks.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.337
Now he dies in the driveway.

04:21.361 --> 04:22.471
Well, it sounds like you got

04:22.495 --> 04:23.606
a problem in your neighborhood,
Mr. Rodgers.

04:23.630 --> 04:24.807
That's a nice sweater,
by the way.

04:24.831 --> 04:27.543
Boys, we are going
to need that videotape.

04:27.567 --> 04:30.913
Yes, you can use it to document
what these punks did last night.

04:30.937 --> 04:31.914
We're only interested

04:31.938 --> 04:33.816
in what happened
to Lance Corporal Korby.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.852
Thank you.

04:35.876 --> 04:37.587
You got a time of death, Duck?

04:37.611 --> 04:39.322
This can't be true.

04:39.346 --> 04:42.225
I mean, the heat
from the exhaust fumes should

04:42.249 --> 04:45.161
raise his body temperature,
but he's curiously cold.

04:45.185 --> 04:46.929
Frigid, in fact.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.365
It's a mystery to be solved

04:49.389 --> 04:51.558
by examination later.

04:54.160 --> 04:58.007
Whoa-oa-oa-oa!

04:58.031 --> 05:00.543
It must be Korby's Joke Lab.

05:00.567 --> 05:04.614
And possibly our crime scene.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.148
Signs of a struggle.

05:06.172 --> 05:07.316
How can you tell?

05:07.340 --> 05:09.785
This place is a mess.

05:09.809 --> 05:12.243
Pranksters don't break
their own stuff.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.391
Well, he's certainly in rigor.

05:15.415 --> 05:17.126
Guess we should lay him down.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.652
Unless he's going to drive.

05:19.653 --> 05:20.863
Zombie.

05:20.887 --> 05:22.298
It's Halloween and we...

05:22.322 --> 05:25.258
- Come on!
- I'm sorry.

05:29.729 --> 05:31.073
What was that?

05:31.097 --> 05:33.142
Sounded like it came
from inside the body.

05:33.166 --> 05:36.202
Push him down flat, Mr. Palmer.

05:39.606 --> 05:41.484
Duck?

05:41.508 --> 05:42.685
No idea.

05:42.709 --> 05:44.921
Even if he was in full rigor,

05:44.945 --> 05:46.355
he wouldn't be brittle.

05:46.379 --> 05:49.405
Forceps, Mr. Palmer.

05:51.618 --> 05:54.815
It's odd, indeed.

06:00.593 --> 06:02.438
Thank you.

06:02.462 --> 06:04.862
Let's see, now.

06:10.470 --> 06:11.747
Is that glass?

06:11.771 --> 06:13.449
No, it's part of his throat.

06:13.473 --> 06:14.517
Look, it-it's

06:14.541 --> 06:15.651
frozen solid.

06:15.675 --> 06:17.954
What could get something
that cold? Dry ice?

06:17.978 --> 06:19.555
Or liquid nitrogen.

06:19.579 --> 06:22.742
Either way, I think you found
your cause of death.

06:29.322 --> 06:31.267
Oh, yeah.

06:31.291 --> 06:34.203
67 on the tally of disturbances.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.771
Tony, how about we focus

06:35.795 --> 06:37.626
on a crime in ourjurisdiction?

06:40.900 --> 06:43.212
Thrill me, McGoblin.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.847
Lance Corporal James Korby.

06:44.871 --> 06:47.083
A joker with no criminal record

06:47.107 --> 06:48.150
and one big blemish

06:48.174 --> 06:49.352
on his service record.

06:49.376 --> 06:52.021
Bumped back in rank
for dereliction of duty.

06:52.045 --> 06:54.557
Explains why he's
a 37-year-old lance corporal.

06:54.581 --> 06:57.884
This is his wife Sara Korby.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.898
He didn't kill himself.

07:02.922 --> 07:04.166
How do you know?

07:04.190 --> 07:05.868
Because nobody married to her

07:05.892 --> 07:07.203
kills themselves.

07:07.227 --> 07:08.804
She's way too attractive
for him.

07:08.828 --> 07:10.272
The wife did it.

07:10.296 --> 07:12.041
Should we even bother
investigating

07:12.065 --> 07:13.476
or just go ahead and arrest her?

07:13.500 --> 07:15.344
Oh, I like where you're
going with that, McGee.

07:15.368 --> 07:19.099
Do you have any idea where
the wife was last night, Tony?

07:20.507 --> 07:21.484
No.

07:21.508 --> 07:22.918
Do you?

07:22.942 --> 07:25.588
Yes. I just got off the phone
with the Seabright Hotel and Spa

07:25.612 --> 07:29.091
in Virginia Beach, where
Korby's wife was checked in.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.960
- And?
- And she and Korby's

07:30.984 --> 07:33.262
stepdaughter are on their way in
to I.D. the body.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.430
And?

07:34.454 --> 07:35.798
And what?

07:35.822 --> 07:37.700
She spent the night
alone in a hotel,

07:37.724 --> 07:41.203
three days after her husband
gets back from the Middle East?

07:41.227 --> 07:42.938
Probies.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.106
The wife did it.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.908
You always say that.

07:45.932 --> 07:47.843
Well, it's almost always true.

07:47.867 --> 07:48.867
Excuse me.

07:50.937 --> 07:55.051
I'm Sara Korby.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.952
Yes, you are.

07:56.976 --> 07:59.488
Now, Mrs. Korby,

07:59.512 --> 08:02.058
your husband was alone
last night, is that right?

08:02.082 --> 08:04.560
Uh, yes.

08:04.584 --> 08:07.396
Halloween was his
favorite time of year.

08:07.420 --> 08:09.398
Practical jokes were
his passion.

08:09.422 --> 08:12.721
Um...

08:14.594 --> 08:17.119
I was in Virginia Beach.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.776
I spent the night at a friend's.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.344
Until the police broke it up.

08:22.368 --> 08:23.979
Party was over anyway.

08:24.003 --> 08:26.482
Right.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.284
I noticed you have quite
the setup in your garage.

08:28.308 --> 08:32.755
Oh, James would spend days
in there this time of year.

08:32.779 --> 08:34.190
A couple years back,
we made a deal;

08:34.214 --> 08:36.292
He would spend Halloween

08:36.316 --> 08:40.696
working on his projects, and I
would spend the night at a spa.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.832
I didn't want to go this year,

08:42.856 --> 08:44.756
'cause he'd just
gotten back, but...

08:48.161 --> 08:52.675
Uh, James didn't mention
any problems, did he?

08:52.699 --> 08:54.343
Fights, disagreements,
that kind of thing?

08:54.367 --> 08:55.678
No.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.480
Everything seemed fine.

08:57.504 --> 08:59.682
He had a car pick me up,

08:59.706 --> 09:01.884
drive me to Virginia Beach.

09:01.908 --> 09:04.186
Rachel,

09:04.210 --> 09:07.423
he was your stepfather?

09:07.447 --> 09:09.692
James and Sara are
both my stepparents.

09:09.716 --> 09:13.028
My mom died when I was little.

09:13.052 --> 09:14.163
I married.

09:14.187 --> 09:15.764
Rachel's father five years ago.

09:15.788 --> 09:17.299
He was killed in Iraq.

09:17.323 --> 09:21.137
Wow. I'm sorry.

09:21.161 --> 09:22.571
Everyone liked James,

09:22.595 --> 09:25.875
even if they didn't get
his sense of humor.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.177
Speaking of no sense of humor,

09:28.201 --> 09:31.981
what about your neighbor
Ted Rodgers?

09:32.005 --> 09:34.216
A few days ago,

09:34.240 --> 09:37.620
when he realized that James
was back from Afghanistan,

09:37.644 --> 09:40.704
they had some words about
my husband's idea of fun.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.559
Ted complained about everything.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.362
Yeah, I picked up on that.

09:46.386 --> 09:49.265
Interesting date for
such a ghoulish demise.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.553
It's a cool way to go.

09:53.393 --> 09:54.370
Cool as in "cold."

09:54.394 --> 09:55.504
I'm sorry.

09:55.528 --> 09:56.739
You're not taking pleasure

09:56.763 --> 09:58.774
out of the method
of our victim's death,

09:58.798 --> 10:00.376
are you, Mr. Palmer?

10:00.400 --> 10:01.544
No, of course not.

10:01.568 --> 10:03.712
It's just like what
you said... very...

10:03.736 --> 10:05.080
Halloween-y.

10:05.104 --> 10:07.583
Just reminds me of a few pranks
I'm not too proud of.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.951
Then perhaps you should refrain

10:08.975 --> 10:10.386
from discussing them.

10:10.410 --> 10:11.954
Then what can we discuss, Duck?

10:11.978 --> 10:15.191
Confirmation
of my earlier hypothesis,

10:15.215 --> 10:19.461
to wit... courtesy of Abby...

10:19.485 --> 10:22.898
manner of death was indeed the
ingestion of liquid nitrogen...

10:22.922 --> 10:24.633
a colorless, odorless substance

10:24.657 --> 10:26.769
which is so cold
that when it comes

10:26.793 --> 10:30.072
into contact with
warm organic material,

10:30.096 --> 10:31.340
it literally boils.

10:31.364 --> 10:32.975
Yeah, you see here,
for instance.

10:32.999 --> 10:35.477
This is our stomach stand-in.

10:35.501 --> 10:36.879
Mr. Palmer?

10:36.903 --> 10:39.497
With pleasure, Doctor.

10:53.486 --> 10:56.198
What's also important to note
is that Korby's throat

10:56.222 --> 10:59.468
had previous scar tissue
from before he was killed.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.437
- Meaning?
- No idea.

11:01.461 --> 11:03.405
Abby's working on that now.

11:03.429 --> 11:07.276
What we do know is that Korby
ingested enough nitrogen

11:07.300 --> 11:10.145
to freeze his internal organs,
but technically,

11:10.169 --> 11:11.780
that was not the cause of death.

11:11.804 --> 11:12.848
What was?

11:12.872 --> 11:14.984
Breathing.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.685
The nitrogen gas
entered his lungs,

11:16.709 --> 11:19.121
essentially suffocating him.

11:19.145 --> 11:20.589
Thank you, Mr. Palmer.

11:20.613 --> 11:22.291
So he didn't die right away.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.193
He lived on for several minutes.

11:24.217 --> 11:25.594
Based on the rate of thaw

11:25.618 --> 11:27.029
and the condition of the body,

11:27.053 --> 11:29.131
I'd estimate that
the time of death

11:29.155 --> 11:31.333
was somewhere between
10:00 and midnight.

11:31.357 --> 11:32.801
Whoa!

11:32.825 --> 11:34.069
Whoops. Heh. Sorry.

11:34.093 --> 11:35.804
That's cold. I got it.

11:35.828 --> 11:37.640
I got it. I'll just,
uh, clean this up.

11:37.664 --> 11:40.309
How much did he ingest, Duck?

11:40.333 --> 11:42.911
A single gulp would suffice.

11:42.935 --> 11:44.980
Likely he was force-fed.

11:45.004 --> 11:46.815
Or he was caught off guard.

11:46.839 --> 11:48.272
Either way, it was no accident.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.874
Certainly not a suicide.

11:54.514 --> 11:55.824
Look at this... two-ply,

11:55.848 --> 11:57.993
double roll top tuck with
a 30-foot vertical climb.

11:58.017 --> 11:59.595
That kid has got an arm.

11:59.619 --> 12:00.829
Perfect drapeage.

12:00.853 --> 12:03.532
It's good trunk-to-top
ratio as well.

12:03.556 --> 12:04.967
It's very impressive.

12:04.991 --> 12:07.836
I do not see
the humor or the art.

12:07.860 --> 12:09.851
It's a cultural thing.

12:10.830 --> 12:12.074
Tony will tell you.

12:12.098 --> 12:14.710
Who are you calling?

12:14.734 --> 12:16.779
Right. Thanks.

12:16.803 --> 12:19.481
Having the wife's
file sent over.

12:19.505 --> 12:22.685
Does your gut ever give you
a stomachache, Tony?

12:22.709 --> 12:25.120
Keep snickering while I'm
over here breaking the case.

12:25.144 --> 12:27.356
Everyone is breaking the case.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.725
You brought us coffee?

12:29.749 --> 12:31.417
Nope.

12:33.353 --> 12:35.331
It's apple cider.

12:35.355 --> 12:36.332
Yep.

12:36.356 --> 12:38.157
Happy Halloween!

12:39.392 --> 12:40.416
Break's over.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.505
Run it.

12:43.529 --> 12:45.441
Yes. Uh, we are still

12:45.465 --> 12:47.242
scrubbing the video
from the kids, boss.

12:47.266 --> 12:48.377
Multiple neighbors

12:48.401 --> 12:49.645
have filed complaints
against Korby.

12:49.669 --> 12:52.114
But only one neighbor has filed
multiple complaints.

12:52.138 --> 12:53.882
Ted Rodgers lives
across the street.

12:53.906 --> 12:55.784
I still think the wife is...

12:55.808 --> 12:57.786
Wow, this has got
some back bite.

12:57.810 --> 12:59.254
A little peppery,

12:59.278 --> 13:00.789
a hint of clove, and really...

13:00.813 --> 13:02.838
Rodgers... you two... go.

13:09.555 --> 13:12.434
There's no candy here!

13:12.458 --> 13:14.436
NCIS! We don't want candy!

13:14.460 --> 13:17.072
Speak for yourself, David.

13:17.096 --> 13:20.862
Open up, or we'll
send the kids in.

13:25.171 --> 13:27.282
Very convincing nerd outfit.

13:27.306 --> 13:29.718
This is how I dress for work.

13:29.742 --> 13:31.754
You're going to work now?

13:31.778 --> 13:33.589
I work at home.

13:33.613 --> 13:35.758
I'm a commodities trader...
Asian markets.

13:35.782 --> 13:37.726
This is the start
of my business day.

13:37.750 --> 13:39.328
Your porch light's on.

13:39.352 --> 13:41.163
Means you have candy...
that's standard

13:41.187 --> 13:43.832
Halloween etiquette.

13:43.856 --> 13:46.902
That's better.

13:46.926 --> 13:49.204
Now, let's talk.

13:49.228 --> 13:50.672
About what?

13:50.696 --> 13:54.109
About the three police reports
you filed against James Korby.

13:54.133 --> 13:58.380
Over the years, his antics have
cost me a lot of time and money.

13:58.404 --> 14:00.983
Shaving cream in my mailbox,

14:01.007 --> 14:02.251
food coloring in my pool.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.186
I don't care if he was a hero
in Afghanistan.

14:04.210 --> 14:07.589
On this block, he was
a pain in the ass.

14:07.613 --> 14:10.926
Girlfriend in college got
a restraining order against you.

14:10.950 --> 14:13.662
So I'm guessing there's a temper
under that cardigan.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.564
We have a witness

14:15.588 --> 14:17.866
who says you confronted
Korby yesterday.

14:17.890 --> 14:19.601
Given the history
between you two...

14:19.625 --> 14:22.304
Are you accusing me of murder?

14:22.328 --> 14:23.839
No, we're just asking you
really nicely

14:23.863 --> 14:25.207
if you did it.

14:25.231 --> 14:27.256
So, Mr. Rodgers, did you
kill your neighbor?

14:28.835 --> 14:30.546
No.

14:30.570 --> 14:33.515
Where were you last night
between 10:00 p.m. and midnight?

14:33.539 --> 14:37.319
Online, live, in front
of the camera on my computer

14:37.343 --> 14:39.154
with our office in Shanghai.

14:39.178 --> 14:40.722
Every minute.

14:40.746 --> 14:43.544
I don't trust a guy who doesn't
give candy to kids.

14:45.318 --> 14:46.979
Trick or treat!

14:48.454 --> 14:50.156
Oh, great.

15:02.335 --> 15:05.747
Energy drinks.
Just what this holiday needed.

15:05.771 --> 15:08.137
Their parents are
going to love that.

15:14.180 --> 15:15.548
Hey, Abby.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.365
Welcome to the random
factory, Gibbs.

15:23.389 --> 15:25.400
Most of Korby's prank stuff,

15:25.424 --> 15:27.302
it's motion sensor-activated,
so until I get a chance

15:27.326 --> 15:32.662
to process it all,
you need to move very slowly.

15:38.671 --> 15:40.349
No costumes this year, Abbs?

15:40.373 --> 15:45.254
Oh. After last year's
Jonas Brothers debacle,

15:45.278 --> 15:46.722
Vance banned the costumes.

15:46.746 --> 15:48.190
McGee, skinny jeans,

15:48.214 --> 15:49.391
it didn't work.

15:49.415 --> 15:50.559
What do you got?

15:50.583 --> 15:52.261
A car...

15:52.285 --> 15:53.862
at the scene of the crime.

15:53.886 --> 15:57.032
It's only a glimpse, but
the time stamps indicate that

15:57.056 --> 16:00.502
it was taken around the time
of death... 11:13 p.m.

16:00.526 --> 16:01.503
You get a plate?

16:01.527 --> 16:03.906
No. No visual on the driver.

16:03.930 --> 16:05.941
But when I enhance the image,

16:05.965 --> 16:08.297
I did manage to get this.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.514
It's a livery number.

16:12.538 --> 16:15.317
From the Quantico Marine Base
motor pool.

16:15.341 --> 16:16.985
Vehicles can only
be signed out...

16:17.009 --> 16:18.287
By a Marine.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.012
- Nice work, Abbs.
- Wait, wait!

16:21.581 --> 16:23.276
There's more.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.666
Sample from our
dead Marine's stomach.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.801
I expected to find

16:32.825 --> 16:35.304
liquid nitrogen, of course,
but I did not expect

16:35.328 --> 16:37.239
to find traces
of turpentine, acetone

16:37.263 --> 16:39.408
and benzene in his flesh.

16:39.432 --> 16:40.909
Paint thinner?

16:40.933 --> 16:42.311
Yeah.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.680
Liquid nitrogen killed him
last night,

16:44.704 --> 16:47.316
but it wasn't the cause of
his ulcerated stomach lining.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.351
Someone tried to poison
him before last night.

16:49.375 --> 16:50.786
When?

16:50.810 --> 16:52.487
According
to the chemical levels,

16:52.511 --> 16:55.591
he ingested the paint thinner
two months ago.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.259
While he was still overseas.

16:57.283 --> 16:59.194
Whoever tried to kill
Lance Corporal Korby

16:59.218 --> 17:00.395
in Afghanistan...

17:00.419 --> 17:02.319
Finished it here.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.111
Aw, what's the matter, McGee?

17:16.135 --> 17:17.713
No one come to your door?

17:17.737 --> 17:19.414
I think I deserve a treat.

17:19.438 --> 17:20.715
Hey!

17:20.740 --> 17:21.817
Why is that?

17:21.840 --> 17:24.419
Because the wife did it, probie.

17:24.443 --> 17:26.688
The stepdaughter, Rachel,
is from a previous marriage.

17:26.712 --> 17:29.958
But Sara Korby has been married

17:29.982 --> 17:31.493
three times!

17:31.517 --> 17:33.829
All Marines, all dead,

17:33.853 --> 17:36.098
all with juicy life
insurance payouts.

17:36.122 --> 17:38.300
Once is a tragedy,
twice a coincidence,

17:38.324 --> 17:40.402
three times is a pattern.

17:40.426 --> 17:42.671
We're talking about
a black ops widow.

17:42.695 --> 17:45.841
Tony, the first two husbands
died in the line of duty...

17:45.865 --> 17:47.342
giving you no reason to suspect

17:47.366 --> 17:49.878
she had anything to do
with the third one's death.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.947
- Well, I got...
- Evidence?

17:51.971 --> 17:54.016
Not to speak of, boss.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.083
Then stop speaking.

17:55.107 --> 17:56.184
McGee.

17:56.208 --> 17:57.819
According to base
motor pool records,

17:57.843 --> 18:00.656
the car we're looking for is
still missing from the livery.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.557
No sign of anyone
checking it out.

18:02.581 --> 18:03.959
Boss, I am gonna find that car.

18:03.983 --> 18:05.160
Hello.

18:05.184 --> 18:06.795
Korby's tour in Afghanistan...

18:06.819 --> 18:08.730
his file, where is it?

18:08.754 --> 18:10.098
Central Command
hasn't declassified

18:10.122 --> 18:11.466
the after-action report yet.

18:11.490 --> 18:14.036
Unit's only been back 72 hours.

18:14.060 --> 18:15.537
Just waiting for the report.

18:15.561 --> 18:16.738
Wait faster.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.040
Thanks.

18:18.064 --> 18:20.008
Korby's squad leader
just arrived at the gate.

18:20.032 --> 18:21.376
All right, come on.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.911
You're with me.

18:22.935 --> 18:26.048
It says here you're up for
a promotion, Sergeant Barnes.

18:26.072 --> 18:27.249
Yes, sir.

18:27.273 --> 18:29.651
So was Lance Corporal Korby.

18:29.675 --> 18:32.187
You did not give him
a very good recommendation.

18:32.211 --> 18:34.690
"Korby has, at times,
proven to be difficult

18:34.714 --> 18:36.158
"to discipline.

18:36.182 --> 18:38.193
A detriment to unit
cohesion and morale."

18:38.217 --> 18:40.262
I also said Korby
was a dedicated,

18:40.286 --> 18:42.030
courageous, hard-working Marine.

18:42.054 --> 18:44.066
Even in battle, he was
a practical joker, no?

18:44.090 --> 18:45.100
Yes, ma'am.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.968
Right. What's funny in boot camp

18:46.992 --> 18:50.205
isn't always funny
in a live-fire zone.

18:50.229 --> 18:51.640
Two schools of thought
in battle.

18:51.664 --> 18:54.209
Some marines like to keep
their focus... head on a swivel.

18:54.233 --> 18:56.178
Yeah, some like
to keep it loose,

18:56.202 --> 18:57.345
keep from cracking.

18:57.369 --> 18:59.214
Half the guys loved Korby.

18:59.238 --> 19:01.783
The other half, not so much.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.351
What about you?

19:03.375 --> 19:05.053
As their squad leader,
it was my job

19:05.077 --> 19:06.588
to keep the peace
between the two.

19:06.612 --> 19:08.523
Well, someone got
mad enough at Korby

19:08.547 --> 19:11.560
to slip him a dose of paint
thinner... almost killed him.

19:11.584 --> 19:14.029
Korby was ill a few days.

19:14.053 --> 19:15.297
Thought it was a stomach virus.

19:15.321 --> 19:16.798
Never said anything
about being poisoned.

19:16.822 --> 19:19.034
Where were you two nights ago?

19:19.058 --> 19:20.535
Finishing up
debriefing paperwork.

19:20.559 --> 19:22.003
Never left the base.

19:22.027 --> 19:24.621
Who in the unit had the biggest
problem with Korby?

19:26.966 --> 19:29.127
No one in particular, sir.

19:31.203 --> 19:33.181
Okay.

19:33.205 --> 19:35.050
Then we investigate them all.

19:35.074 --> 19:37.409
Put a hold on all promotions.

19:40.146 --> 19:42.791
It's gonna get ugly.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.612
Sir.

19:46.452 --> 19:48.352
Private David Singer.

19:50.756 --> 19:53.168
He and Korby had a falling out.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.023
Didn't come from me.

19:56.595 --> 19:58.907
- One, two, three.
- One!

19:58.931 --> 20:00.242
One, two, three.

20:00.266 --> 20:01.243
Two!

20:01.267 --> 20:03.078
- One, two, three.
- Three!

20:03.102 --> 20:04.579
One, two, three.

20:04.603 --> 20:07.616
Let's go! Let's do it!
Go, go, go! Do it! Do it!

20:07.640 --> 20:08.950
Private David Singer?

20:08.974 --> 20:09.951
Yeah.

20:09.975 --> 20:12.387
NCIS.

20:12.411 --> 20:14.422
Why don't you take a break.

20:14.446 --> 20:17.025
Maybe take a shower. Whoof!

20:17.049 --> 20:18.293
We hear that you and
Lance Corporal Korby

20:18.317 --> 20:21.296
had a falling-out in Kandahar?

20:21.320 --> 20:22.697
Korby showed me the ropes.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.232
We had some laughs at first,

20:24.256 --> 20:26.067
but things aren't
so funny in Afghanistan,

20:26.091 --> 20:27.803
and I told him as much.

20:27.827 --> 20:28.970
That's all.

20:28.994 --> 20:30.672
Well, not quite all.

20:30.696 --> 20:32.061
Korby's dead.

20:34.133 --> 20:35.677
Where were you two nights ago?

20:35.701 --> 20:38.346
In Norfolk, visiting a friend.

20:38.370 --> 20:40.215
Does this friend live
on a street corner

20:40.239 --> 20:42.551
and deal pharmaceuticals out
of a paper bag, by any chance?

20:42.575 --> 20:45.153
I'm not on the juice,
if that's what you're implying.

20:45.177 --> 20:46.788
It's all natural.

20:46.812 --> 20:48.643
Don't let it scare you.

20:50.182 --> 20:52.116
Alibi have a name?

20:54.119 --> 20:56.765
Those things on the
side of your head work?

20:56.789 --> 20:58.166
The man asked you a question.

20:58.190 --> 20:59.234
Although short-term memory loss

20:59.258 --> 21:00.569
and shrunken testicles
are a sign...

21:00.593 --> 21:02.571
Have you ever been shot at?

21:02.595 --> 21:04.039
Once or twice.

21:04.063 --> 21:05.674
People were getting
blown up over there,

21:05.698 --> 21:07.275
and Korby's saran-wrapping
guys into their cots.

21:07.299 --> 21:08.743
And what's your point?

21:08.767 --> 21:11.346
Some of us didn't
appreciate it...

21:11.370 --> 21:13.315
his stupid pranks.

21:13.339 --> 21:15.350
But none of us killed him.

21:15.374 --> 21:17.986
No one would have
taken it that far.

21:18.010 --> 21:20.069
Yeah? How far did it go?

21:23.816 --> 21:25.427
Chris Norton...

21:25.451 --> 21:27.996
high school buddy.

21:28.020 --> 21:30.488
That's who I was with
the other night.

21:33.525 --> 21:35.804
Boss.

21:35.828 --> 21:37.739
Still working on getting
those paper files,

21:37.763 --> 21:40.175
but I did have a chat
with Central Command

21:40.199 --> 21:41.509
in Afghanistan up in MTAC.

21:41.533 --> 21:43.278
Don't brag, McGee,
it's unbecoming.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.813
Talk.

21:44.837 --> 21:47.682
I was able to put together a
brief history of Korby's unit.

21:47.706 --> 21:48.950
It's not good.

21:48.974 --> 21:51.119
They had multiple transfer
requests, complaints.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.688
They were deemed "not combat-
ready" two different times.

21:53.712 --> 21:55.056
Unit was in chaos.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.324
Korby's distractions
were more serious

21:56.348 --> 21:58.460
than his squad leader
lead us to believe.

21:58.484 --> 21:59.794
This started two months ago.

21:59.818 --> 22:02.464
- After Korby was poisoned.
- And before that,

22:02.488 --> 22:03.965
only exemplary remarks
about the unit.

22:03.989 --> 22:05.133
Citations, promotions.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.501
They were on their third tour.

22:06.525 --> 22:07.736
It was a well-oiled machine.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.472
What would make
a Marine unit fall apart?

22:10.496 --> 22:11.740
Lack of discipline.

22:11.764 --> 22:13.459
Yep. Or too much.

22:15.034 --> 22:17.812
18,000 breaths a day.

22:17.836 --> 22:21.283
It's hardly surprising what
ends up in one's lungs.

22:21.307 --> 22:23.919
Bacteria, insects...

22:23.943 --> 22:26.554
Guess we'll have to wait and see
what our dead Marine inhaled.

22:26.578 --> 22:27.889
Ah, Jethro.

22:27.913 --> 22:29.824
Take those up to Abby,
would you, please, Mr. Palmer?

22:29.848 --> 22:30.825
Yes, Doctor.

22:30.849 --> 22:32.394
I'm glad you're here.

22:32.418 --> 22:34.362
- Body was beaten, Duck.
- I found evidence

22:34.386 --> 22:37.265
of multiple contusions
and abrasions.

22:37.289 --> 22:42.103
Usually, I do my autopsies
from the outside in,

22:42.127 --> 22:45.473
but, uh, due to the frosty
circumstances here,

22:45.497 --> 22:47.609
I was forced
to reverse the process.

22:47.633 --> 22:48.944
When?

22:48.968 --> 22:52.714
Well, based on the healing
of this rib fracture here,

22:52.738 --> 22:56.051
I'd say that those injuries
were probably sustained

22:56.075 --> 22:59.354
before he was poisoned
the first time.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.089
- Afghanistan.
- Mm.

23:01.113 --> 23:03.224
Attackers avoided vital organs?

23:03.248 --> 23:06.294
Correct. There were no blows
on the kidneys or spleen.

23:06.318 --> 23:07.929
Tried to teach him a lesson.

23:07.953 --> 23:09.998
Tried to hurt him without
really hurting him?

23:10.022 --> 23:12.000
You've seen this before,
I presume?

23:12.024 --> 23:13.702
Yeah. Code Red.

23:13.726 --> 23:16.805
Somebody gave Korby a beat-down
before moving on to poison.

23:16.829 --> 23:18.640
Someone?

23:18.664 --> 23:21.142
There are traces of bruising
on his wrists and ankles.

23:21.166 --> 23:24.846
Additionally,
subdural contusions

23:24.870 --> 23:27.315
suggest that at least
four assailants

23:27.339 --> 23:30.418
delivered a myriad of blows.

23:30.442 --> 23:34.089
These patterns tell me that
this was more than just someone.

23:34.113 --> 23:37.139
Whole squad wanted
this guy gone, Duck.

23:47.292 --> 23:48.803
Where are we going?

23:48.827 --> 23:50.271
Mobile campfire.

23:50.295 --> 23:52.240
Think on Your Feet.

23:52.264 --> 23:53.241
Go.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.943
Still looking for
the mystery car.

23:54.967 --> 23:56.344
Stop.

23:56.368 --> 23:58.079
Probies, talk louder.

23:58.103 --> 23:59.968
I can hear you in there.

24:03.742 --> 24:06.421
Tony, McGee has been
here for six years.

24:06.445 --> 24:07.989
I have been here for four.

24:08.013 --> 24:10.325
I know you're enjoying this,
but we are agents.

24:10.349 --> 24:12.227
So could you please
stop calling us...

24:12.251 --> 24:13.895
Problem, probie?

24:13.919 --> 24:16.097
You've been an agent
for all of one week.

24:16.121 --> 24:18.800
Your Mossad liaison days
are over. DiNozzo!

24:18.824 --> 24:20.769
Mobile campfire.

24:20.793 --> 24:23.171
Ah, dead Marine prankster
whose, uh, mischief

24:23.195 --> 24:24.839
sparked a beat-down
in Afghanistan,

24:24.863 --> 24:26.574
courtesy of his entire squad.

24:26.598 --> 24:29.177
Our only evidence is
a vehicle from the Quantico

24:29.201 --> 24:31.112
motor pool
at the scene of the crime.

24:31.136 --> 24:33.481
We have not found the car or
any record of who signed it out.

24:33.505 --> 24:36.484
We were able to track down
the addresses of each Marine

24:36.508 --> 24:38.453
who was on Korby's unit
in the area

24:38.477 --> 24:40.155
the night of the murder...
six hits.

24:40.179 --> 24:43.171
McGee, take Ziva with you.

24:44.183 --> 24:46.194
This guy was a genius.

24:46.218 --> 24:48.630
He chronicled all
of his exploits

24:48.654 --> 24:50.665
on his phone... it's like
a master's course.

24:50.689 --> 24:53.435
600 pizzas delivered
to the battalion CP.

24:53.459 --> 24:56.171
He reassembled a Humvee
inside the Officer's Club.

24:56.195 --> 24:58.540
If only I had the
appropriate time and space

24:58.564 --> 25:01.209
to use the bounty of
ideas in front of me.

25:01.233 --> 25:02.811
The case, Abbs. The case.

25:02.835 --> 25:06.448
I finished processing everything
from Korby's garage.

25:06.472 --> 25:07.615
Still no murder weapon.

25:07.639 --> 25:09.384
Which means the killer
either kept it...

25:09.408 --> 25:10.618
Or they dumped it.

25:10.642 --> 25:12.487
And probably nearby.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.155
And certainly
with traces of nitrogen.

25:14.179 --> 25:15.957
So I alerted
the local waste management

25:15.981 --> 25:17.992
to be on the lookout
for hazardous materials.

25:18.016 --> 25:19.394
And the fire department's.

25:19.418 --> 25:21.563
HAZMAT team is searching
the entire neighborhood.

25:21.587 --> 25:22.697
A lot of manpower.

25:22.721 --> 25:25.300
A four-block radius
and more than 60 homes.

25:25.324 --> 25:27.602
Can I have my Caf-POW! Now?

25:27.626 --> 25:28.937
Palmer!

25:28.961 --> 25:30.538
No more refills.

25:30.562 --> 25:33.165
I just came to, uh,
return the surplus nitrogen.

25:36.635 --> 25:37.679
Okay...

25:37.703 --> 25:39.881
it's the results
from the substance

25:39.905 --> 25:41.416
that you and Ducky found

25:41.440 --> 25:43.051
in the dead Marine's lungs.

25:43.075 --> 25:45.086
It's odd.

25:45.110 --> 25:48.356
Traces of chicken stock,
coffee beans, cocoa...

25:48.380 --> 25:49.757
Lunch.

25:49.781 --> 25:52.093
Yeah, but I didn't
find traces of any

25:52.117 --> 25:53.561
of this food in his stomach.

25:53.585 --> 25:55.063
The nitrogen gas
must have carried

25:55.087 --> 25:56.384
the particles into the lungs.

25:57.890 --> 26:00.068
There could have been
food residue on the inside

26:00.092 --> 26:01.569
of the container the killer used

26:01.593 --> 26:02.837
to administer
the liquid nitrogen.

26:02.861 --> 26:04.239
Like a lunchbox?

26:04.263 --> 26:05.507
Thinking, like, a thermos.

26:05.531 --> 26:07.475
You know, perfect size,
insulated.

26:07.499 --> 26:09.177
It's discreet.

26:09.201 --> 26:11.079
Palmer, you're a genius.

26:11.103 --> 26:13.715
The killer probably used Korby's
coffee thermos to poison him.

26:13.739 --> 26:16.584
Now I can tell the HAZMAT
team what to look for.

26:16.608 --> 26:17.852
That's great work, Abbs.

26:17.876 --> 26:19.867
- Both of you.
- Aah!

26:28.287 --> 26:29.564
Ladies.

26:29.588 --> 26:32.433
Cleaning up the crime scene?

26:32.457 --> 26:35.436
Sweeping away old memories.

26:35.460 --> 26:39.364
You sure you want
to throw these away?

26:41.300 --> 26:44.045
Yup.

26:44.069 --> 26:46.560
What can I do for you,
Agent DiNozzo?

26:48.740 --> 26:52.453
I was just wondering if your
husband ever talked about

26:52.477 --> 26:55.190
what happened overseas.

26:55.214 --> 26:59.394
You know, other
Marines in his squad?

26:59.418 --> 27:00.828
No.

27:00.852 --> 27:05.448
No? Never talked to you about
getting beat up or poisoned?

27:07.359 --> 27:09.003
Hmm. Well, that's interesting.

27:09.027 --> 27:11.506
I guess you two
didn't talk much, then.

27:11.530 --> 27:14.042
What are you implying?

27:14.066 --> 27:15.243
You've lost three husbands.

27:15.267 --> 27:16.744
All three had life
insurance policies.

27:16.768 --> 27:18.580
- Meaning?
- Well, you seem to be attracted

27:18.604 --> 27:21.049
to men who have a hard
time staying alive, Sara.

27:21.073 --> 27:23.151
I'm attracted to men
with dignity and honor

27:23.175 --> 27:25.787
who put themselves
in harm's way for their country.

27:25.811 --> 27:28.056
I grew up in a military family.

27:28.080 --> 27:30.058
I fell in love
with men who served.

27:30.082 --> 27:31.993
Two of them died doing it.

27:32.017 --> 27:34.796
I've given a lot.
I've taken very little.

27:34.820 --> 27:36.331
Well, half-a-million-dollar
payout

27:36.355 --> 27:37.966
on the two previous policies,

27:37.990 --> 27:41.536
plus another $250,000
from Korby's.

27:41.560 --> 27:43.871
You can understand my
skepticism... it's adding up.

27:43.895 --> 27:45.406
My husband didn't complain.

27:45.430 --> 27:47.242
He didn't dwell
on negative things.

27:47.266 --> 27:48.743
He chose to celebrate life.

27:48.767 --> 27:51.479
He tried to make others smile.

27:51.503 --> 27:54.315
I loved him for that.

27:54.339 --> 27:57.706
Excuse me, Mrs. Korby?

27:59.945 --> 28:01.469
Private Singer.

28:03.649 --> 28:06.227
Do I need to make
introductions, or...

28:06.251 --> 28:08.062
- you two already...
- Just paying my respects.

28:08.086 --> 28:10.098
- Okay.
- That a problem?

28:10.122 --> 28:11.933
No.

28:11.957 --> 28:13.101
Ma'am,

28:13.125 --> 28:15.770
me and your husband,
we had our issues,

28:15.794 --> 28:17.272
but we served together.

28:17.296 --> 28:19.507
He saved my ass a time or two.

28:19.531 --> 28:20.842
I'm sorry.

28:20.866 --> 28:23.130
Thank you, Private.

28:27.406 --> 28:29.484
Are we finished?

28:29.508 --> 28:31.386
Yeah.

28:31.410 --> 28:33.401
Excuse me.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.164
Sky falling?

28:43.188 --> 28:45.266
Wife might be telling the truth.

28:45.290 --> 28:46.634
So, yeah.

28:46.658 --> 28:48.603
Your killer instinct was wrong.

28:48.627 --> 28:50.004
Temporarily misguided.

28:50.028 --> 28:52.073
What did my probie
sandwich find out?

28:52.097 --> 28:54.442
Well, we interviewed
every member of Korby's squad,

28:54.466 --> 28:56.577
including two in Bethesda,
and they all admit.

28:56.601 --> 28:58.846
Korby's pranks
caused problems...

28:58.870 --> 29:01.115
But denied having
knowledge of the Code Red

29:01.139 --> 29:02.784
or the poisoning in Afghanistan.

29:02.808 --> 29:04.519
They were covering
for each other.

29:04.543 --> 29:05.687
Taking a break, DiNozzo?

29:05.711 --> 29:08.289
No, boss. Just looking
at the sprinkler system.

29:08.313 --> 29:10.124
Ooh, the sign-out log
from the company command post

29:10.148 --> 29:11.859
on base... that's
a nice job, boss.

29:11.883 --> 29:12.975
Page 28.

29:14.453 --> 29:18.366
Korby's squad leader,
Sergeant Barnes, lied to us.

29:18.390 --> 29:20.368
He did sign off the base
the night of the murder.

29:20.392 --> 29:21.569
That's not all
Barnes lied about.

29:21.593 --> 29:24.305
I just the after-action
reports from Kandahar.

29:24.329 --> 29:25.406
The promotion Barnes was

29:25.430 --> 29:26.708
looking forward to
was already denied.

29:26.732 --> 29:28.843
"Unsatisfactory leadership."

29:28.867 --> 29:30.178
When?

29:30.202 --> 29:32.413
Three months ago,
while serving in Afghanistan.

29:32.437 --> 29:33.948
Just before Korby was poisoned.

29:33.972 --> 29:35.283
And the unit went bonkers.

29:35.307 --> 29:36.307
Find him.

29:42.647 --> 29:43.858
Germans.

29:43.882 --> 29:45.126
Fun-loving bunch.

29:45.150 --> 29:46.661
Care to oompah?

29:46.685 --> 29:47.829
There's Barnes.

29:47.853 --> 29:50.231
Yes, there he is. Herr Barnes.

29:50.255 --> 29:51.866
We need to speak to you.

29:51.890 --> 29:54.381
Excuse me one second.

29:55.994 --> 29:57.905
Can we do this some other time?

29:57.929 --> 30:00.775
- Uh... let me check. Ziva?
- No.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.877
No. See? We can't do it
another time. Achtung, baby.

30:02.901 --> 30:04.045
- Come on; Let's go.
- Look, this is important.

30:04.069 --> 30:05.046
I need to talk to these guys.

30:05.070 --> 30:06.171
Yeah, yeah, come on.

30:08.774 --> 30:10.618
Whoa, whoa, whoa. NCIS.

30:10.642 --> 30:11.734
Settle down, gentlemen.

30:14.913 --> 30:16.813
Well done, probie.

30:17.916 --> 30:19.594
Fraulein.

30:19.618 --> 30:22.644
Danke schoen. Beer's on him.

30:23.855 --> 30:26.134
Sorry about that.

30:26.158 --> 30:28.626
You certainly
made an impression.

30:36.535 --> 30:39.414
Korby cost you a promotion.

30:39.438 --> 30:41.783
So you poisoned him.

30:41.807 --> 30:45.119
When that didn't work,
you finished the job here.

30:45.143 --> 30:47.321
Company log,
night of the murder.

30:47.345 --> 30:48.923
You signed out.

30:48.947 --> 30:50.244
Man up, Marine.

30:57.823 --> 30:59.634
I did it for him.

30:59.658 --> 31:01.269
- Who?
- Korby.

31:01.293 --> 31:02.570
He was a great Marine, but...

31:02.594 --> 31:03.738
What happened?

31:03.762 --> 31:04.872
We had incoming fire

31:04.896 --> 31:06.374
in a warehouse outside Herat,

31:06.398 --> 31:09.177
when I turn to see
Korby's flak jacket on fire.

31:09.201 --> 31:10.711
Gave away our position.

31:10.735 --> 31:11.712
Barely got out of there.

31:11.736 --> 31:13.147
One of his jokes?

31:13.171 --> 31:14.615
Faulty flare casing.

31:14.639 --> 31:16.150
An accident.

31:16.174 --> 31:18.519
Nobody saw it that way.

31:18.543 --> 31:21.022
Thought one of his gags
almost got us all killed.

31:21.046 --> 31:23.344
They sent him a message.

31:26.151 --> 31:28.129
I knew about the Code Red.

31:28.153 --> 31:29.997
Thought it would help
put Korby straight,

31:30.021 --> 31:31.232
for his own good.

31:31.256 --> 31:32.967
But...

31:32.991 --> 31:34.836
he was still Korby.

31:34.860 --> 31:36.828
So you poisoned him?

31:38.630 --> 31:42.977
I put a drop of paint thinner
in his coffee... a drop.

31:43.001 --> 31:45.880
I wanted to get him
shipped home on medical leave.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.782
I did it for him, for the unit,

31:47.806 --> 31:49.183
before someone really got hurt.

31:49.207 --> 31:51.052
I did it to save him.

31:51.076 --> 31:53.087
Somehow the guys found out
what I'd done and...

31:53.111 --> 31:54.856
And they lost respect
for their leader.

31:54.880 --> 31:56.711
The unit fell apart.

31:58.783 --> 32:00.410
Night of the murder.

32:01.620 --> 32:03.664
A barmaid at a club in Fairfax.

32:03.688 --> 32:05.666
She'll confirm
I was there all night,

32:05.690 --> 32:07.001
getting face time
with my seniors.

32:07.025 --> 32:09.357
Trying to get my promotion
back on track.

32:10.762 --> 32:13.253
That's not gonna happen.

32:20.605 --> 32:22.316
Oh, hey, boss.

32:22.340 --> 32:24.151
Listen, is there any more
of that apple cider?

32:24.175 --> 32:27.110
'Cause I found it
de-cider-ly delicious.

32:29.681 --> 32:31.158
Barnes's alibi checks out.

32:31.182 --> 32:32.426
He was at the strip club

32:32.450 --> 32:34.529
till 2:00 am... they have him
on security cameras.

32:34.553 --> 32:37.565
I still maintain that the wife's
holding something back.

32:37.589 --> 32:40.067
Marine vehicle was
at the scene, DiNozzo.

32:40.091 --> 32:42.370
That does suggest a Marine.

32:42.394 --> 32:44.205
None of the motor pool logs have

32:44.229 --> 32:46.007
a record of which Marine
checked out the car.

32:46.031 --> 32:47.430
Just that it left the base.

32:49.701 --> 32:51.145
Boss, well,
it's not about the car,

32:51.169 --> 32:52.313
but I have been
running financials

32:52.337 --> 32:53.748
on every member of Korby's unit

32:53.772 --> 32:55.149
looking for inconsistencies.

32:55.173 --> 32:57.218
- Yeah, and you got one?
- Yep. Private David Singer.

32:57.242 --> 32:59.320
He told us he was in Norfolk

32:59.344 --> 33:00.888
with a friend
the night of the murder.

33:00.912 --> 33:02.657
Yeah, well, he's got
a credit card charge

33:02.681 --> 33:03.891
in Virginia Beach that night.

33:03.915 --> 33:05.760
The charge was for a
room-service delivery

33:05.784 --> 33:07.662
- of champagne and caviar.
- Where?

33:07.686 --> 33:11.065
Seabright Hotel and Spa.

33:11.089 --> 33:12.533
That's the hotel

33:12.557 --> 33:15.870
where Korby's wife was staying.

33:15.894 --> 33:17.738
Private Singer.

33:17.762 --> 33:21.842
Sorry to keep you
out of the gym.

33:21.866 --> 33:23.878
Don't worry, you'll have
plenty of time to work out

33:23.902 --> 33:24.912
when you're in prison.

33:24.936 --> 33:26.013
The hell you talking about?

33:26.037 --> 33:28.215
Keeping somebody
like Mrs. Korby happy

33:28.239 --> 33:30.051
takes a lot of reps, huh?

33:30.075 --> 33:31.719
You and the widow
licking champagne

33:31.743 --> 33:33.921
off each other's toes down
there in Virginia Beach.

33:33.945 --> 33:37.525
Then you took a little detour,
decided to kill Korby.

33:37.549 --> 33:39.527
The hotel valet has the car

33:39.551 --> 33:42.463
you borrowed from Quantico
checked out all night.

33:42.487 --> 33:46.567
You did bring it back
in the morning, though.

33:46.591 --> 33:49.136
Innocent man usually
explains himself,

33:49.160 --> 33:50.627
and the guilty ones object.

33:52.998 --> 33:56.911
You might even fall
into the third category:

33:56.935 --> 33:59.927
The guy who covers
for his lover.

34:02.674 --> 34:05.609
Okay.

34:09.347 --> 34:10.558
If Tony's right about the wife,

34:10.581 --> 34:11.926
I will never live it down.

34:11.949 --> 34:14.661
Whoo-hoo!
It's getting pretty ripe

34:14.686 --> 34:16.630
in that room.

34:16.655 --> 34:18.532
He's about to flip on the wife.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.201
He doesn't have to.

34:20.225 --> 34:21.636
Pulled Korby's
credit card records.

34:21.659 --> 34:23.036
According to Abby,
the garden hose

34:23.061 --> 34:25.706
and duct tape were brand-new,
but there's no record

34:25.730 --> 34:27.141
of Korby actually
purchasing them.

34:27.165 --> 34:28.208
Cash?

34:28.233 --> 34:29.377
The wife's credit card

34:29.400 --> 34:31.411
was used one week ago
at a hardware store

34:31.436 --> 34:33.179
garden hose

34:33.204 --> 34:36.217
and a roll of duct tape.

34:36.241 --> 34:37.685
Well, bring her in.

34:37.708 --> 34:39.543
I cannot believe it.

34:50.221 --> 34:53.246
Know about your affair
with Private Singer.

34:54.793 --> 34:56.203
He told you?

34:56.226 --> 34:57.705
No, he didn't have to.

34:57.729 --> 35:01.042
Fancy hotel,
sounds of the ocean,

35:01.066 --> 35:02.743
caviar and champagne.

35:02.767 --> 35:06.380
Singer thought he was in for
a treat, but you tricked him.

35:06.404 --> 35:07.715
You used him.

35:07.739 --> 35:09.450
No.

35:09.474 --> 35:10.885
You gave Singer
the hose and tape,

35:10.909 --> 35:12.787
told him to make it
look like a suicide.

35:12.811 --> 35:14.388
He drove from the hotel
to your house;

35:14.412 --> 35:15.413
He killed your husband.

35:18.983 --> 35:21.662
David wasn't
at the house that night.

35:21.686 --> 35:23.497
I was.

35:23.521 --> 35:25.433
You drove Singer's
car to your house

35:25.457 --> 35:26.801
and killed your husband?

35:26.825 --> 35:27.917
No.

35:29.694 --> 35:32.606
I couldn't go through
with it, the affair.

35:32.630 --> 35:34.408
I couldn't cheat on James.

35:34.432 --> 35:36.644
I didn't have my own car,
I'd been dropped off

35:36.668 --> 35:39.447
by the service at the hotel,
so I borrowed David's.

35:39.471 --> 35:42.516
I drove back home
to tell my husband

35:42.540 --> 35:45.486
the truth, but I just...

35:45.510 --> 35:48.856
sat in front of the house
and I lost my nerve.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.357
So I left.

35:50.381 --> 35:52.493
I went back to the hotel

35:52.517 --> 35:54.428
and I broke it off with David.

35:54.452 --> 35:56.997
Yeah, well, I don't think
he got the message.

35:57.021 --> 35:59.700
So you admit to being
at the scene of the crime

35:59.724 --> 36:00.868
at the time of death?

36:00.892 --> 36:03.504
I did not kill my husband.

36:03.528 --> 36:05.172
It's the truth.

36:05.196 --> 36:06.307
I swear to you.

36:06.331 --> 36:07.541
Well, now you get

36:07.565 --> 36:09.009
to convince a jury
of your peers.

36:09.033 --> 36:10.044
That would be a jury

36:10.068 --> 36:11.178
of tall, leggy,
blonde bombshells.

36:11.202 --> 36:12.346
Why don't you stand up?

36:12.370 --> 36:14.315
You're under arrest

36:14.339 --> 36:16.217
for the murder of Lance
Corporal James Korby.

36:16.241 --> 36:17.469
No.

36:18.576 --> 36:19.687
No, you're not.

36:19.711 --> 36:21.555
DiNozzo...

36:21.579 --> 36:22.705
evidence garage, now.

36:25.483 --> 36:26.994
- Hey, McGee.
- Yeah, boss?

36:27.018 --> 36:28.662
Footage of the Marine car.

36:28.686 --> 36:30.779
Let me pull it up.

36:35.326 --> 36:36.452
Rewind it.

36:42.467 --> 36:45.346
There, freeze it.

36:45.370 --> 36:46.847
Can you clean that up?

36:46.871 --> 36:48.736
Let's see.

36:50.608 --> 36:54.021
It's a car parked on the street.

36:54.045 --> 36:56.357
Boss, that's Korby's car.

36:56.381 --> 36:57.381
Nice.

36:58.750 --> 37:00.227
You don't have
to say anything...

37:00.251 --> 37:01.962
about me being right.

37:01.986 --> 37:03.230
About the wife.

37:03.254 --> 37:05.051
Okay.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.235
DiNozzo, driver's side.

37:08.259 --> 37:09.403
Come on.

37:09.427 --> 37:10.571
Uh, boss?

37:10.595 --> 37:12.039
Get in.

37:12.063 --> 37:15.066
Okeydokey.

37:16.167 --> 37:17.778
The seat is too far forward.

37:17.802 --> 37:19.480
Exactly.

37:19.504 --> 37:21.415
The seat has been in that
position since the murder.

37:21.439 --> 37:22.583
Car was parked in the street

37:22.607 --> 37:24.185
when the footage
of the Marine car

37:24.209 --> 37:25.386
was captured by those kids.

37:25.410 --> 37:28.222
But when Korby was
found dead in the car...

37:28.246 --> 37:30.124
The car was parked
in his driveway.

37:30.148 --> 37:31.892
Pull all financial records

37:31.916 --> 37:34.248
from the death
of Sara's second husband.

37:36.287 --> 37:37.798
Sara?

37:37.822 --> 37:39.633
I got your text.

37:39.657 --> 37:42.148
I was just gonna go for a run.

37:44.529 --> 37:46.407
She couldn't make it.

37:46.431 --> 37:48.909
Well, then why did she text me?

37:48.933 --> 37:50.594
She didn't.

37:55.640 --> 37:57.017
What's that?

37:57.041 --> 37:59.520
The thermos we found in
your friend's trash can.

37:59.544 --> 38:02.122
The friend you were with
the night of the murder.

38:02.146 --> 38:04.124
Traces of liquid
nitrogen in there.

38:04.148 --> 38:07.361
I don't understand.

38:07.385 --> 38:08.929
Everybody was so drunk
at the party,

38:08.953 --> 38:10.698
I guess they didn't
see you slip out

38:10.722 --> 38:12.333
for a little while, did they?

38:12.357 --> 38:14.201
Found your prints.

38:14.225 --> 38:16.170
We also know that,
uh, you bought

38:16.194 --> 38:19.340
the hose and the tape using
Sara's credit card last week.

38:19.364 --> 38:20.641
Clerk I.D.'d your photo.

38:20.665 --> 38:22.142
You tried to frame
your stepmother

38:22.166 --> 38:23.310
for your stepfather's murder.

38:23.334 --> 38:25.012
Dutiful daughter
delivers a thermos

38:25.036 --> 38:27.248
of "cocoa" to stepdaddy.

38:27.272 --> 38:29.216
But he's too preoccupied
to notice what's in it

38:29.240 --> 38:31.652
- until it's too late.
- No.

38:31.676 --> 38:34.304
No. Why would I do that?

38:35.146 --> 38:37.324
James and Sara were all I had.

38:37.348 --> 38:39.159
Except for your trust fund.

38:39.183 --> 38:42.448
Your biological father left it
to you when he died in Iraq.

38:43.721 --> 38:46.200
Sara has control
of the trust fund

38:46.224 --> 38:48.802
until your 25th birthday,
but if she's behind bars,

38:48.826 --> 38:50.804
then you would get
your inheritance

38:50.828 --> 38:53.741
a little earlier, huh?
All $200,000 of it.

38:53.765 --> 38:56.377
Add Korby's
life insurance policy...

38:56.401 --> 38:58.245
That's another 250 grand.

38:58.269 --> 38:59.413
You're all set.

38:59.437 --> 39:01.715
Go to college,
buy yourself a fast car,

39:01.739 --> 39:04.451
maybe a little pad on the beach.

39:04.475 --> 39:05.986
But wait five years?

39:06.010 --> 39:09.537
That's an eternity to a pretty
little party girl like you.

39:13.351 --> 39:16.430
With them, it was an eternity.

39:16.454 --> 39:18.432
You have no idea.

39:18.456 --> 39:21.235
A stepfather who acts like

39:21.259 --> 39:22.503
a juvenile delinquent.

39:22.527 --> 39:25.072
A stepmother who marries
anything in a uniform.

39:25.096 --> 39:26.640
You saw her.

39:26.664 --> 39:28.188
She uses men.

39:29.801 --> 39:32.613
She used my dad.

39:32.637 --> 39:35.003
Your dad died
serving his country.

39:41.346 --> 39:44.291
What's going to happen
to my money?

39:44.315 --> 39:46.093
It's yours in five years.

39:46.117 --> 39:51.031
It's gonna go a long way
in the prison gift shop.

39:51.055 --> 39:52.599
Morning, Ziva.

39:52.623 --> 39:55.970
Good morning. Coffee?

39:55.994 --> 39:57.757
Oh, thank you.

40:03.868 --> 40:05.893
All right.

40:07.905 --> 40:09.896
My keyboard is not working.

40:11.676 --> 40:14.488
Agh! Abby...

40:14.512 --> 40:17.091
I love Halloween.

40:17.115 --> 40:19.606
And what's not to love?
Pranks...

40:21.352 --> 40:24.131
Halloween is officially
my favorite holiday.

40:24.155 --> 40:25.599
And you are looking

40:25.623 --> 40:28.251
at this year's
Larceny Lotto Winner.

40:29.460 --> 40:30.971
So you're buying us
lunch today, or?

40:30.995 --> 40:33.407
I didn't keep the money,
McNopoly.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.576
Gave it to charity...
urban youth group.

40:35.600 --> 40:37.344
My gut is not-for-profit.

40:37.368 --> 40:39.346
You know, Tony,
I've been thinking,

40:39.370 --> 40:43.083
and, um, I would like
to acknowledge my place

40:43.107 --> 40:46.086
as a new agent,
and your place as...

40:46.110 --> 40:47.839
Your superior in every way?

40:49.447 --> 40:50.758
Yes.

40:50.782 --> 40:53.627
But for my sanity, could
you not call me "probie"?

40:53.651 --> 40:55.118
I say it with love.

40:56.821 --> 40:58.665
And if I refuse?

40:58.689 --> 41:03.704
You are senior field
agent, and I am...

41:03.728 --> 41:07.027
entirely at your mercy.

41:08.900 --> 41:11.368
Well, as you should be.
