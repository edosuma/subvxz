WEBVTT

00:02.613 --> 00:05.748
Mmm, another great dinner, Ma.

00:05.749 --> 00:06.782
Thanks, Mikey.

00:06.783 --> 00:08.217
Makes me feel good
to know you get

00:08.218 --> 00:10.585
at least one decent meal a week.

00:10.587 --> 00:12.721
Well, you know I cook for him.

00:12.723 --> 00:13.788
I know.

00:14.725 --> 00:16.459
Peggy, healthy food
can be delicious, too.

00:16.460 --> 00:17.492
Right, Mike?

00:17.494 --> 00:20.061
Yeah, that's what you keep
telling me.

00:21.398 --> 00:22.598
Hey, by the way,
what are you doing

00:22.599 --> 00:24.799
next Wednesday at 5:30 a.m.?

00:24.801 --> 00:25.968
Um, let's see.

00:25.969 --> 00:28.203
Unless I get a paper route
I will be sleeping.

00:28.205 --> 00:29.537
Mm.

00:29.539 --> 00:33.075
My church group is taking a van
to the casino in Rockford.

00:33.076 --> 00:34.577
I could use a seatmate

00:34.578 --> 00:37.178
and maybe we could go halfsies
on a penny slot.

00:37.180 --> 00:38.681
Wait a minute,
is this next Wednesday?

00:38.682 --> 00:41.484
I actually have a real excuse
why I can't go.

00:41.485 --> 00:44.986
I got tickets for that pl...
I got tickets for a play.

00:44.988 --> 00:47.222
Oh, yeah, you're going to see
that thing about werewolves.

00:47.224 --> 00:50.793
I'm, well, I'm going to see
a play at Steppenwolf.

00:50.794 --> 00:54.262
It's the most, it's the most
famous theater in Chicago?

00:54.264 --> 00:58.333
Right, and thank you
for not making me go.

00:58.335 --> 01:00.902
All right, I'll go
to your werewolf play,

01:00.904 --> 01:02.538
but next time we do my thing.

01:02.539 --> 01:03.872
Wait, what?
If you're going to take a trip

01:03.874 --> 01:06.274
with my ma, can I have
the guys over for cards?

01:06.276 --> 01:08.143
No, we're not taking
a trip together.

01:08.145 --> 01:10.712
So, I go to your dumb play
and you do squat for me?

01:10.714 --> 01:12.914
I never asked you to come
to the play with me.

01:12.916 --> 01:15.350
Oh, fine, after I rearranged
my whole schedule.

01:15.352 --> 01:16.918
You didn't change anything.

01:16.920 --> 01:19.088
So, is that a no on poker?
Yes.

01:19.089 --> 01:21.190
So that's a yes on poker? No.

01:21.191 --> 01:22.157
All right.

01:22.159 --> 01:23.125
Don't snap at him.

01:23.126 --> 01:24.894
You're the one
promising him things

01:24.895 --> 01:26.027
and then taking them away.

01:26.029 --> 01:28.296
All right, we're done.
Dinner's over.

01:28.298 --> 01:30.298
Oh, fine, go ahead and go.

01:30.300 --> 01:33.234
Cut into the only time I spend
with my son all week.

01:33.236 --> 01:34.370
There it is.

01:34.371 --> 01:36.038
Okay, if you're not
being a bully,

01:36.039 --> 01:37.173
you're playing the martyr.

01:37.174 --> 01:38.974
You know why I don't want
to take a trip with you?

01:38.975 --> 01:41.910
Because you are 100%
pure uncut misery.

01:41.912 --> 01:44.312
You suck the joy out
of any situation.

01:44.314 --> 01:47.782
You are a joyless
fun-sucker. Yeah.

01:47.784 --> 01:50.018
All right.

01:50.020 --> 01:51.253
Let me have it, Peggy.

01:51.254 --> 01:53.823
Okay, vomit up the bile
like you always do.

01:53.824 --> 01:57.659
Tell me why I'm such a horrible,
ungrateful daughter-in-law.

01:59.596 --> 02:01.697
Mom?

02:01.698 --> 02:02.897
Oh, faking

02:02.899 --> 02:03.899
a heart attack.

02:03.900 --> 02:05.934
Classic fun-sucker move.

02:05.936 --> 02:07.469
Molly, she's not faking.

02:07.471 --> 02:08.904
Call 911.

02:08.905 --> 02:10.573
Oh, my God.

02:10.574 --> 02:12.808
Okay. All right.

02:12.809 --> 02:14.710
Oh, I can't...
I hate this purse.

02:14.711 --> 02:15.945
I can't find anything.

02:15.946 --> 02:16.912
Use the landline.

02:16.913 --> 02:18.380
Good idea. Good idea.

02:18.381 --> 02:19.547
It's okay, Ma. It's okay.

02:19.549 --> 02:20.549
Keep listening to my voice.

02:20.550 --> 02:21.750
You're gonna be okay.

02:21.752 --> 02:23.252
Okay, I dialed my cell phone.

02:23.253 --> 02:25.720
When it rings, pick it up
and then dial 911.

02:25.722 --> 02:27.623
Just call 911!

02:27.624 --> 02:28.357
Better.

02:28.358 --> 02:31.059
You're going to be okay.

03:02.867 --> 03:04.100
Hey.

03:04.102 --> 03:05.202
How's she doing?

03:05.203 --> 03:07.103
Well, she seemed to come
around in the ambulance

03:07.105 --> 03:09.273
and when the paramedic
opened her shirt,

03:09.274 --> 03:12.275
she slapped him
and called him a pervert, so...

03:12.277 --> 03:14.111
Well, that's a good sign.

03:14.112 --> 03:15.511
So, so what happened?

03:15.513 --> 03:17.614
Excellent question.

03:17.615 --> 03:20.951
I mean, really excellent,
uh, question.

03:20.952 --> 03:24.355
Who, who knows
what ever actually,

03:24.356 --> 03:26.924
really is ever happening.

03:26.925 --> 03:28.925
Eh, you know.

03:28.927 --> 03:31.894
So she just keeled over,
right out of the blue?

03:32.731 --> 03:34.531
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

03:34.532 --> 03:36.133
I mean, we were, we were talking

03:36.134 --> 03:39.203
about taking a,
a trip together to the casino.

03:39.204 --> 03:42.773
And our, our schedules weren't,
weren't quite lining up.

03:42.774 --> 03:44.975
And um, you know,
she may have started

03:44.976 --> 03:48.111
to get a, a little bit upset
about that, but...

03:48.113 --> 03:49.078
Oh, so, you were fighting.

03:49.080 --> 03:50.114
That makes more sense.

03:50.115 --> 03:51.749
No, no, no, no.

03:51.750 --> 03:52.716
We were not fighting.

03:52.717 --> 03:54.518
We were having
a spirited conversation.

03:54.519 --> 03:55.752
So you were really
giving it to her.

03:55.754 --> 03:57.287
No.

03:57.288 --> 03:58.554
No.

03:58.556 --> 04:00.057
Why am I on trial here?

04:00.058 --> 04:01.492
I mean,
Peggy had a heart attack.

04:01.493 --> 04:02.593
We are all very concerned.

04:02.594 --> 04:03.560
End of story.

04:03.561 --> 04:05.628
Got it. You weren't even there.

04:06.464 --> 04:08.399
You could say you were
with me and Joyce.

04:08.400 --> 04:10.067
Yeah, we were playing rummy.

04:10.068 --> 04:11.968
This helps us, too.

04:12.804 --> 04:15.105
No, nobody's helping anybody.

04:15.106 --> 04:17.173
I didn't do anything wrong.

04:17.175 --> 04:18.709
Hey.

04:18.709 --> 04:19.709
Hey, how is she?

04:19.711 --> 04:20.611
What'd the doctor say?

04:20.612 --> 04:22.412
It was a mild heart attack.

04:22.414 --> 04:23.480
She's resting, they're going

04:23.481 --> 04:24.881
to keep her overnight
for observation,

04:24.883 --> 04:27.049
but we should be able to
bring her home tomorrow.

04:27.051 --> 04:28.184
Okay, good.

04:28.186 --> 04:29.119
Thank God.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.421
How are you doing?
I've been better.

04:30.422 --> 04:32.122
I'm just, I'm glad she's okay.

04:32.123 --> 04:34.224
Me, too.

04:34.225 --> 04:37.126
Me, me, too.

04:45.770 --> 04:48.972
You know, Carl,
we've seen it all on this job.

04:48.973 --> 04:52.709
But when it's your mother
laying on the ground,

04:52.710 --> 04:54.677
nothing can prepare you
for that.

04:54.679 --> 04:56.180
Yeah, it's a good
thing you were there.

04:56.181 --> 04:57.181
Damn right.

04:57.182 --> 04:58.282
I'm such a terrible son.

04:58.283 --> 05:00.883
I had to drag myself over
to that Sunday dinner.

05:00.885 --> 05:02.019
Hey, come on now.

05:02.020 --> 05:02.853
It's not just about
your mother, all right.

05:02.854 --> 05:04.487
You drag yourself everywhere.

05:06.157 --> 05:08.925
I think it's your low
center of gravity, just...

05:16.768 --> 05:18.969
Well, she deserves better.

05:18.970 --> 05:20.737
I mean, she raised me
all by herself

05:20.738 --> 05:21.972
on a lunch lady's paycheck.

05:21.973 --> 05:22.972
Do you know how hard that is?

05:22.974 --> 05:25.508
Mm. They sacrifice
everything for us.

05:25.510 --> 05:27.043
And what do we do for them?
Nothing.

05:27.045 --> 05:28.512
Actually, I bought mine a Kindle

05:28.513 --> 05:29.680
and a well for her village.

05:29.681 --> 05:32.448
So speak for yourself.

05:34.886 --> 05:36.687
I'm telling you, man,
this is a wakeup call.

05:36.688 --> 05:38.155
I'm getting a second chance
with her.

05:38.156 --> 05:39.522
I'm not going to take it
for granted.

05:39.524 --> 05:41.524
Good for you. I'm not going
to let things go unsaid.

05:41.526 --> 05:43.292
I'm going to make sure
she knows how I feel.

05:43.294 --> 05:44.228
As you should.

05:44.229 --> 05:45.329
And if you love somebody,
tell them.

05:45.330 --> 05:46.362
It doesn't cost you nothing.

05:46.364 --> 05:47.830
Mike.

05:47.832 --> 05:49.499
Don't say it, Carl.

05:49.501 --> 05:51.034
Man, don't flatter yourself.

05:51.035 --> 05:53.803
I was going to ask you
to pass me the salt.

05:55.306 --> 05:57.007
Thank you.

05:57.008 --> 05:58.242
And I love you.

05:58.243 --> 05:59.909
All right.

06:02.547 --> 06:05.147
Vince, how we doing?

06:05.149 --> 06:06.350
Just finished.

06:06.351 --> 06:07.818
So you got the bench
and the handrails in the shower?

06:07.819 --> 06:08.818
Check.

06:08.820 --> 06:10.621
And that elevated toilet seat
is in

06:10.622 --> 06:13.589
and works like a charm, once
you get used to the splashing.

06:15.426 --> 06:17.293
I told you to stay off of it.

06:17.295 --> 06:21.063
You kidding? That's like baking
a cake without taking a bite.

06:21.065 --> 06:22.799
Okay, are we missing anything?

06:22.800 --> 06:24.067
I mean,
should we cover the outlets

06:24.068 --> 06:25.569
or is that just for babies?

06:25.570 --> 06:26.536
Molly,

06:26.538 --> 06:28.604
relax, you've done plenty.

06:28.606 --> 06:30.807
I ever tell you the time I was
watching my neighbor's parrot

06:30.808 --> 06:32.142
while they were on vacation?

06:32.143 --> 06:33.544
Nope.

06:33.545 --> 06:35.145
I never let that thing
out of my sight

06:35.146 --> 06:37.047
until one day
I left him in a hot car

06:37.048 --> 06:40.884
because they wouldn't let birds
in the bowling alley.

06:40.885 --> 06:42.386
I felt awful.

06:42.387 --> 06:44.854
Car smelled like fried chicken
for two weeks.

06:44.856 --> 06:47.024
Vince.

06:47.025 --> 06:49.226
Is there a point to your story?

06:49.227 --> 06:51.128
I'm just saying guilt
is a funny thing.

06:51.129 --> 06:52.863
Eventually I forgave myself.

06:52.864 --> 06:54.665
Maybe you should do the same.

06:54.666 --> 06:56.300
There's no need for forgiveness.

06:56.301 --> 06:57.668
I'm being a good
daughter-in-law.

06:57.669 --> 06:59.570
You're the one
that murdered a parrot.

06:59.571 --> 07:02.605
Hey, we both got blood
on our hands.

07:02.607 --> 07:06.642
Mine's just
got feathers mixed in.

07:06.644 --> 07:09.313
Trust me, Vince,
if I could cause a heart attack,

07:09.314 --> 07:11.814
you'd be floppin'
on the floor right now.

07:13.318 --> 07:16.118
Here we are, home sweet home.

07:16.120 --> 07:17.220
Hi, Peggy.

07:17.221 --> 07:19.989
Oh, look who got her color back.

07:19.991 --> 07:21.758
They must've been giving you
nitroglycerin

07:21.759 --> 07:24.227
because you look dynamite.

07:29.634 --> 07:31.000
Ah.

07:31.836 --> 07:33.436
Get out.

07:34.372 --> 07:36.572
Well, Vince, you heard her.

07:38.643 --> 07:41.911
No, you. Get the hell
out of my house.

07:41.913 --> 07:44.180
What?

07:48.720 --> 07:52.788
There's an elevated
toilet seat, just...

07:55.226 --> 07:57.560
...watch out for the splashing.

08:10.241 --> 08:12.075
Why are you making her soup

08:12.076 --> 08:13.810
when she threw you
out of her house?

08:13.811 --> 08:15.912
She just went through a trauma.

08:15.913 --> 08:18.914
She's lashing out at
the first person she saw.

08:18.916 --> 08:20.583
Didn't she see Mike first?

08:20.584 --> 08:22.519
And Vince was there, too.

08:22.520 --> 08:23.452
Well...

08:23.454 --> 08:25.522
You know what?
I'm the strongest,

08:25.523 --> 08:27.123
and she knew
that I could take it.

08:27.124 --> 08:30.225
And frankly, I'm glad
I could be there for her.

08:31.395 --> 08:33.096
Hey.

08:33.097 --> 08:34.798
Hey. I just got
to grab some stuff

08:34.799 --> 08:36.532
and then I'm headed
back over to Mom's.

08:36.534 --> 08:38.467
Oh good. You know what,
take this with you.

08:38.469 --> 08:40.003
I made her turkey noodle soup.

08:40.004 --> 08:43.572
And I left the bones in 'cause
I know she loves to crack 'em.

08:45.342 --> 08:47.376
Ah, that, that's okay,
leave it here.

08:47.378 --> 08:49.244
No, Mike, come on,
I want to help.

08:49.246 --> 08:50.913
Don't you think
you've done enough?

08:52.750 --> 08:54.316
What's that supposed to mean?

08:54.318 --> 08:56.952
Look, uh, I don't want
to get into this right now.

08:56.954 --> 08:58.555
No, no, no, no, no, no.

08:58.556 --> 09:00.056
Come on, you can't blame all

09:00.057 --> 09:01.490
of this on me, can you?

09:01.492 --> 09:02.859
You mean,
would she have had a heart attack

09:02.860 --> 09:04.094
if you hadn't yelled at her?

09:04.095 --> 09:05.327
It's a good question.

09:05.329 --> 09:07.230
Hey, let's go do that thing
we were going to do.

09:07.231 --> 09:08.264
To get away from their fighting?

09:08.265 --> 09:09.933
Yes.

09:09.934 --> 09:11.101
We are not fighting.

09:11.102 --> 09:12.201
Yes, we are.

09:12.203 --> 09:13.836
Look, all she wanted was

09:13.838 --> 09:15.305
to spend a little time with you,

09:15.306 --> 09:16.672
and you couldn't give her that.

09:16.674 --> 09:18.208
Mike, I spent
the last six months

09:18.209 --> 09:20.642
with her writing
a book. I did my time.

09:20.644 --> 09:23.011
My mother is not
a stretch at Joliet.

09:23.013 --> 09:24.414
I didn't mean it like that.

09:24.415 --> 09:27.817
Admit it, you never liked her.

09:27.818 --> 09:31.286
When have I ever denied it?

09:37.695 --> 09:38.862
Ah, here we go.

09:38.863 --> 09:39.995
Easy with the leg.

09:39.997 --> 09:43.232
I'm not Nadia Comaneci.

09:43.234 --> 09:45.068
Well, I'm just trying
to make you comfortable, Ma.

09:45.069 --> 09:46.169
Eh.

09:46.170 --> 09:48.404
All right, do you feel any of
the following?

09:48.405 --> 09:50.039
Dizziness?
No.

09:50.040 --> 09:51.141
Numbness?
No.

09:51.142 --> 09:52.308
Any pain?
Yep.

09:52.309 --> 09:54.676
Where?
Right in front of me.

09:55.513 --> 09:57.247
Look, I'm just following
doctor's orders.

09:57.248 --> 09:58.948
And by the way,
you can't have a BLT.

09:58.949 --> 10:00.349
Too many nitrates.

10:00.351 --> 10:01.885
Ah, what do these doctors know?

10:01.886 --> 10:03.820
They keep flip-flopping
on stuff.

10:03.821 --> 10:07.189
One day smoking's bad,
one day it's good.

10:07.191 --> 10:12.162
But it, it actually says on
the package, "This will kill you."

10:12.163 --> 10:14.663
You'll see.

10:15.533 --> 10:18.267
I'm just glad
you're home and okay.

10:18.269 --> 10:19.903
I don't know what I'd do
if something happened to you.

10:19.904 --> 10:20.836
I told you,

10:20.838 --> 10:22.739
open that metal box
in the attic.

10:22.740 --> 10:24.506
Everything you need to know
is in there.

10:24.508 --> 10:27.543
And if the dog's alive,
put him down.

10:29.980 --> 10:32.814
I'm not killing your dog.

10:32.816 --> 10:34.684
I'm not asking you
to strangle him.

10:34.685 --> 10:35.985
There's a biscuit in the freezer

10:35.986 --> 10:38.921
marked, "Do not eat."

10:40.090 --> 10:43.726
All right, well,
we'll worry about that later.

10:43.727 --> 10:45.662
You know, in a weird way,
I'm actually glad

10:45.663 --> 10:46.762
all of this happened.

10:46.764 --> 10:48.631
Great, I'll see if I can work up

10:48.632 --> 10:51.600
a stroke for your next birthday.

10:51.602 --> 10:53.002
That's not what I meant.

10:53.003 --> 10:54.938
I'm just saying, it gives us
a chance to talk,

10:54.939 --> 10:56.573
so things don't go unsaid.

10:56.574 --> 10:58.340
Like what?

10:58.342 --> 11:00.709
Well, like I love you.

11:00.711 --> 11:03.679
I know that.
What else you got?

11:05.516 --> 11:08.351
That was kind of the biggie.

11:08.352 --> 11:10.185
You got anything
you want to say to me?

11:10.187 --> 11:13.056
Yeah. Open casket,
blue dress for me,

11:13.057 --> 11:15.724
blue sweater for the dog.

11:16.994 --> 11:19.761
All right,
you want mayo on that BLT?

11:19.763 --> 11:21.930
Thanks.

11:25.269 --> 11:26.702
Mom, you got a sec?

11:26.704 --> 11:28.170
Everything okay, sweetie?

11:28.172 --> 11:30.573
Oh, yeah, I just...
I can't sleep.

11:30.574 --> 11:31.874
Come here.

11:31.875 --> 11:33.209
Tell Mommy what the trouble is.

11:33.210 --> 11:35.344
Poppy's here, too.

11:38.315 --> 11:41.551
I just, I keep
going over and over

11:41.552 --> 11:43.052
the fight I had with Mike,

11:43.053 --> 11:44.821
and I-I've been
really thinking hard

11:44.822 --> 11:46.089
about what he said.

11:46.090 --> 11:47.290
Good for you, honey.

11:47.291 --> 11:49.225
Self-reflection's not
an easy thing to do.

11:49.226 --> 11:50.726
No, it's not.

11:50.728 --> 11:52.028
And, you know,
the more I think about it,

11:52.029 --> 11:53.396
and Peggy's heart attack

11:53.397 --> 11:54.964
and, and what led up to it

11:54.965 --> 11:56.132
the more I'm starting
to realize,

11:56.133 --> 11:59.368
I did absolutely nothing wrong.

12:00.104 --> 12:01.137
I thought she was going the

12:01.138 --> 12:02.572
other way with that.

12:02.573 --> 12:04.273
Could you just let her
get to her point.

12:04.275 --> 12:06.208
No, that was my point.

12:06.210 --> 12:07.876
Really?

12:07.878 --> 12:09.746
Did I say some horrible things
to Peggy?

12:09.747 --> 12:11.347
Yes, because she makes me.

12:11.348 --> 12:12.448
I mean, she is the meanest,

12:12.449 --> 12:15.285
most obstinate, uh, obnoxious

12:15.286 --> 12:16.986
woman in the world.

12:16.987 --> 12:18.721
And if anything
was to ever happen to her,

12:18.722 --> 12:20.355
I don't know what I'd do.

12:20.357 --> 12:21.991
Oh, honey.

12:21.992 --> 12:23.326
You know, I don't
know how she did it,

12:23.327 --> 12:26.529
but that old witch
made me love her.

12:26.530 --> 12:28.131
Well, she raised Mike.

12:28.132 --> 12:29.632
There must be something good
in there.

12:29.633 --> 12:30.667
I know.

12:30.668 --> 12:32.468
Peggy doesn't give a damn

12:32.469 --> 12:33.903
what anybody thinks, or,

12:33.904 --> 12:36.105
I mean, she's brutally honest

12:36.106 --> 12:38.274
and she's probably
the only person

12:38.275 --> 12:39.474
that isn't afraid of me.

12:39.476 --> 12:40.809
She's right about that.

12:40.811 --> 12:42.210
Take it easy.

12:42.212 --> 12:45.247
I'm just agreeing with you.

12:51.322 --> 12:54.924
Oh, damn it.

12:54.925 --> 12:55.858
You okay, Ma?

12:55.859 --> 12:57.226
Oh yeah, what the hell are

12:57.227 --> 12:58.261
you doing in here?

12:58.262 --> 12:59.762
Well, I heard a crash.

12:59.763 --> 13:02.332
Suction on the shower caddy
gave out.

13:02.333 --> 13:05.001
Well, we both had a good run.

13:05.002 --> 13:06.168
All right, thank God.

13:06.170 --> 13:07.870
Look, don't move, I'll get it.

13:07.871 --> 13:09.339
Oh, the hell you will.

13:09.340 --> 13:11.407
Look, this is no
time for modesty.

13:11.408 --> 13:12.942
I am not an invalid.

13:12.943 --> 13:14.711
No, you're a woman
who just had a heart attack.

13:14.712 --> 13:17.246
Now back up, I'm going in blind.

13:17.247 --> 13:19.649
All right.

13:19.650 --> 13:21.584
Thanks, Mikey.

13:21.585 --> 13:23.019
Must've taken some guts

13:23.020 --> 13:24.787
to come crashing in here.

13:24.788 --> 13:27.423
I'll admit, I busted through
a lot of doors over my years,

13:27.424 --> 13:29.791
but, uh, that one
was the hardest.

13:31.428 --> 13:33.930
Oh, seems like yesterday

13:33.931 --> 13:36.265
I was giving you baths
in that sink.

13:36.266 --> 13:37.566
Really?
Oh, yeah.

13:37.568 --> 13:39.702
You'd sit there
like a little wet Buddha,

13:39.703 --> 13:42.170
sucking on a stick
of Right Guard.

13:42.172 --> 13:44.573
You let me suck on deodorant?

13:44.575 --> 13:47.376
Relax,
it was the unscented kind.

13:49.046 --> 13:50.279
Listen,

13:50.280 --> 13:53.014
the last thing I want to be
is a burden to you.

13:53.016 --> 13:55.318
Stop it. This is just
a little setback.

13:55.319 --> 13:56.351
You and I both know

13:56.353 --> 13:57.820
where this is going.

13:57.821 --> 14:00.088
I hate that you got
to go through it with me.

14:00.090 --> 14:01.958
Well, I don't.

14:01.959 --> 14:04.026
I'm your son. I'm honored.

14:04.027 --> 14:08.464
You put diapers on me,
and when the time comes,

14:08.465 --> 14:11.133
I will hire someone
to put diapers on you.

14:12.336 --> 14:14.270
You're a good boy, Mikey.

14:14.271 --> 14:16.239
Now, hand me that razor

14:16.240 --> 14:17.773
and a can of Barbisol.

14:17.775 --> 14:19.941
Time for some spring cleaning.

14:22.312 --> 14:24.247
Oh, careful
on that floor, Mikey.

14:24.248 --> 14:25.782
When it gets wet,
it's like an ice rink.

14:25.783 --> 14:28.617
Hey, don't worry about me.

14:31.688 --> 14:33.222
Mikey, you all right?

14:33.223 --> 14:35.291
No!

14:35.292 --> 14:37.193
Oh, Mikey, I'm coming.

14:37.194 --> 14:38.460
Wait.

14:43.467 --> 14:46.668
Okay, now you can help me.

14:52.976 --> 14:54.910
Oh.

14:54.912 --> 14:58.480
Oh, my God.

14:58.482 --> 15:02.317
Hey, you.

15:02.319 --> 15:03.752
How are you feeling, honey?

15:03.754 --> 15:05.588
Great.

15:05.589 --> 15:07.189
Oh, you're so pretty.

15:07.191 --> 15:10.091
Okay, okay.

15:10.093 --> 15:12.061
Don't let that pretty stuff go
to your head.

15:12.062 --> 15:13.963
That's the dope drip talking.

15:13.964 --> 15:16.198
Okay, what happened?

15:16.200 --> 15:20.268
I was taking a shower
with my mommy.

15:20.270 --> 15:24.040
Boy, he is...
he is really out of it.

15:24.041 --> 15:25.408
No, that's actually true.

15:25.409 --> 15:26.708
I was in the shower,

15:26.710 --> 15:28.177
he was trying
to help me shave my...

15:28.178 --> 15:29.144
Eh, eh, eh...

15:29.146 --> 15:30.879
and the end.

15:32.850 --> 15:35.918
Wow, I can't,
uh, seem to keep

15:35.919 --> 15:38.479
this family out of the hospital.

15:41.871 --> 15:46.174
Listen, Peggy, if, if you think
that I did something

15:46.175 --> 15:48.742
that may have caused
your heart attack, I'm sorry.

15:48.744 --> 15:51.346
Oh, please,
don't flatter yourself.

15:51.347 --> 15:53.515
You couldn't kill me
if you tried.

15:53.516 --> 15:54.915
Well...

15:54.917 --> 15:56.618
well, then why are
you so mad at me?

15:56.619 --> 15:57.619
Just drop it.

15:57.620 --> 15:59.421
Well, I think...

15:59.422 --> 16:01.590
I think we both know
I'm not going to do that.

16:01.591 --> 16:03.291
We worked side by side

16:03.292 --> 16:04.659
for six months straight

16:04.660 --> 16:07.895
and you won't sit next to me
for a three hour van ride?

16:07.897 --> 16:10.965
Peggy, it's actually
six hours round-trip.

16:12.835 --> 16:15.503
Well, I'm sorry it's
such a hardship for you.

16:15.504 --> 16:18.706
You know, I thought that's
what friends do together.

16:19.575 --> 16:21.343
Friends?

16:21.344 --> 16:22.711
Never mind.

16:22.712 --> 16:24.345
No, no, now,

16:24.347 --> 16:26.815
I just have never thought
of us that way.

16:26.816 --> 16:31.653
I just need a minute to kind
of roll it around in there.

16:31.654 --> 16:33.221
I like it.

16:33.222 --> 16:36.424
You know? Friend.

16:36.425 --> 16:38.860
I regretted it
as soon as I said it.

16:38.861 --> 16:40.996
Well, no take backs.

16:40.997 --> 16:43.597
You know what I like
to do to my friends?

16:45.067 --> 16:46.935
To hug 'em.

16:46.936 --> 16:49.136
I like to hug 'em.

16:50.573 --> 16:51.740
I liked you better

16:51.741 --> 16:53.208
when you were trying to kill me.

16:59.181 --> 17:01.416
Are you guys hugging?

17:01.417 --> 17:04.685
I am so high.

17:25.247 --> 17:26.547
What a crew, huh?

17:26.548 --> 17:28.215
Don't worry, we won't have

17:28.217 --> 17:29.783
to ride back with these girls.

17:29.785 --> 17:32.119
They're getting
the early shuttle.

17:32.121 --> 17:34.322
Why aren't we getting
the early shuttle?

17:34.323 --> 17:35.289
Are you kidding?

17:35.290 --> 17:37.492
Once these old biddies
warm up the slots,

17:37.493 --> 17:38.926
we'll have the pick
of the litter.

17:38.927 --> 17:41.863
Plus, at midnight,
it's half off shrimp.

17:41.864 --> 17:44.632
Boy, a long van ride
and midnight shrimp.

17:44.633 --> 17:45.566
Mm-hmm.

17:45.567 --> 17:47.502
Does it get any better?

17:47.503 --> 17:48.669
See?

17:48.670 --> 17:50.738
And you didn't want to come.

17:50.739 --> 17:52.006
Who is this, Peggy?

17:52.007 --> 17:54.308
My daughter-in-law.

17:54.309 --> 17:56.043
I thought you
didn't care for her.

17:56.044 --> 17:58.979
No, it's my other one.

18:00.082 --> 18:01.716
You don't have another one.

18:01.717 --> 18:03.918
Come on, we got three
hours ahead of us.

18:03.919 --> 18:05.418
You going to make this awkward?
