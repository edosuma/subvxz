00:11.033 --> 00:13.833
- HEY, YOU STUPID,
STINKIN' HUMP!

00:13.833 --> 00:15.467
YOU'RE A HUMP!
HUMP!

00:15.467 --> 00:18.433
- DAD, BERNIE AND LINDA
ARE HERE FOR DINNER,

00:18.433 --> 00:22.900
SO IT'S TIME TO GO HOME
AND YELL AT YOUR OWN TV.

00:22.900 --> 00:24.367
- DINNER?
WHAT ARE YOU HAVING?

00:24.367 --> 00:29.133
- WE'RE HAVING A BIG BOWL
OF GET OUT OF MY HOUSE, OLD MAN.

00:30.200 --> 00:32.800
- ALL RIGHT.

00:32.800 --> 00:36.633
I FIND YOU VERY RUDE.

00:36.633 --> 00:38.533
[doorbell rings]

00:38.533 --> 00:41.600
- HEY!
- HEY-YA, RAY, WHAT'S UP?

00:41.600 --> 00:42.767
HEY, MR. B!

00:42.767 --> 00:45.433
- YEAH, YEAH.
I'M GOIN' ALREADY.

00:46.633 --> 00:48.100
- HI, MARIE.

00:49.900 --> 00:51.233
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, MA?

00:51.233 --> 00:53.033
- GUESS WHO DIED.

00:53.033 --> 00:54.267
- OHH...
- OHH...

00:54.267 --> 00:55.733
- OH, MARIE. WHO?

00:56.833 --> 01:00.333
- GUESS.

01:00.333 --> 01:03.933
- MA, NOBODY WANTS
TO PLAY THIS GAME.

01:03.933 --> 01:06.300
- CELEBRITY
OR REAL PERSON?

01:07.800 --> 01:09.100
- A REAL PERSON.

01:09.100 --> 01:10.967
- MALE OR FEMALE?
- FEMALE.

01:10.967 --> 01:14.267
- GIVE ME A SECOND HERE.
I'M USUALLY PRETTY GOOD AT THIS.

01:14.267 --> 01:17.533
- MARIE, THIS IS SICK.
WHO IS IT?

01:17.533 --> 01:19.600
- ROSE CAPUTO.

01:19.600 --> 01:20.700
- OHH!
- OHH!

01:20.700 --> 01:23.633
- DAMN IT, MARIE,
I WAS GONNA SAY HER!

01:24.700 --> 01:26.367
- AH, THAT'S TOO BAD.

01:26.367 --> 01:28.433
SHE'S A VERY NICE LADY
WHO LIVES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:28.433 --> 01:30.700
- SHE WAS THE OLDER LADY
AT THE END OF THE BLOCK, RIGHT?

01:30.700 --> 01:31.933
OH, SHE WAS NICE.

01:31.933 --> 01:33.967
- SHE MADE GOOD PIES TOO.

01:33.967 --> 01:36.100
I LIKE PIE.

01:38.667 --> 01:40.400
- SHE WAS A NICE LADY.

01:42.867 --> 01:45.067
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S EAT.

01:45.933 --> 01:48.400
- SHAME ON YOU!

01:48.400 --> 01:50.867
THIS LADY DIES,
AND THIS IS ALL SHE GETS?

01:50.867 --> 01:52.967
- HEY, MARIE, YOU TWO
WEREN'T THAT CLOSE.

01:52.967 --> 01:54.600
WHAT ARE YOU TAKING IT
SO HARD FOR?

01:54.600 --> 01:56.933
- BECAUSE SHE WAS
THE ONE, FRANK.

01:56.933 --> 01:58.733
SHE WAS THE ONE
I PICKED FOR YOU.

01:58.733 --> 02:00.067
- WHAT?

02:00.067 --> 02:03.067
- I WANTED YOU TO BE
WITH ROSE CAPUTO.

02:03.067 --> 02:06.633
- KINKY NEIGHBORHOOD.

02:06.633 --> 02:09.800
- YEARS AGO I DECIDED
TO PICK SOMEONE TO REPLACE ME

02:09.800 --> 02:11.567
IF I DIED BEFORE YOU.

02:11.567 --> 02:13.600
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
TO MARRY ME?

02:13.600 --> 02:17.833
- YES. SOMEONE TO MAKE YOU HAPPY
AFTER I WAS GONE.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.367
- OH, THAT'S NICE, MARIE,

02:19.367 --> 02:22.500
BUT, UH, I THINK
I'D BE HAPPY ENOUGH.

02:32.167 --> 02:34.800
- [singing]
JUNGLE LOVE

02:34.800 --> 02:36.833
IT'S DRIVIN' ME MAD

02:36.833 --> 02:40.067
IT'S MAKING ME CRAZY CRAZY

02:40.067 --> 02:41.700
JUNGLE LOVE

02:41.700 --> 02:42.967
IT'S DRIVING ME MAD

02:42.967 --> 02:46.600
IT'S MAKING ME CRAZY CRAZY

02:46.600 --> 02:47.800
JUNGLE LOVE

02:47.800 --> 02:49.533
IT'S DRIVING ME MAD

02:49.533 --> 02:52.500
IT'S MAKING ME CRAZY CRAZY

02:52.500 --> 02:54.300
JUNGLE LOVE

02:54.300 --> 02:55.900
IT'S DRIVING ME MAD

02:55.900 --> 02:58.033
IT'S MAKING ME CRAZY.

03:03.033 --> 03:04.133
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND, MARIE.

03:04.133 --> 03:05.733
YOU ACTUALLY THOUGHT ABOUT

03:05.733 --> 03:07.533
WHO FRANK SHOULD BE WITH
AFTER YOU'RE GONE?

03:07.533 --> 03:09.367
- OF COURSE.
HE NEEDS A WIFE.

03:09.367 --> 03:11.533
HE CAN'T EVEN
BOIL AN EGG.

03:11.533 --> 03:14.633
I MEAN, IF I GO,
HOW'S HE GONNA...

03:14.633 --> 03:16.967
BOIL AN EGG?

03:16.967 --> 03:18.600
- DID MRS. CAPUTO KNOW

03:18.600 --> 03:20.600
YOU PICKED HER
TO BE WITH FRANK?

03:20.600 --> 03:23.500
- IF SHE DID, IT WOULD'VE
KILLED HER SOONER.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.967
- IT'S TOO BAD.
SHE WAS PERFECT.

03:28.967 --> 03:30.567
OH, BY THE WAY,

03:30.567 --> 03:32.333
THE VIEWING HOURS
ARE THE NEXT THREE NIGHTS

03:32.333 --> 03:34.067
AT CANNIZARO'S FUNERAL HOME.

03:34.067 --> 03:35.967
- OHH...

03:35.967 --> 03:37.933
IS IT GONNA BE
AN OPEN CASKET?

03:37.933 --> 03:40.800
- FOR ROSE CAPUTO?
I HOPE NOT.

03:40.800 --> 03:43.000
- HAVE SOME RESPECT, FRANK.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.967
- HOW ABOUT SOME RESPECT
FOR THE TRUTH?

03:44.967 --> 03:47.233
SHE WASN'T EXACTLY
A LOOKER.

03:47.233 --> 03:50.367
- MA, LOOK. HOW COULD
THIS HAPPEN, ANYWAY?

03:50.367 --> 03:53.133
WHAT ABOUT HER HUSBAND?
ISN'T GEORGE STILL ALIVE?

03:53.133 --> 03:57.333
- YES, BUT THE MAN
IS SUPPOSED TO GO FIRST.

03:57.333 --> 03:59.467
- LOOK, I DON'T CARE
WHO YOU PICKED FOR ME.

03:59.467 --> 04:02.933
I WOULD NEVER SHACK UP
WITH ROSE CAPUTO.

04:02.933 --> 04:07.167
THERE'S A BIG SEA OUT THERE
WITH MUCH BETTER-LOOKIN' FISH.

04:07.167 --> 04:09.467
- OH, REALLY, FRANK?

04:09.467 --> 04:12.000
AND WHO ARE YOU FISHING FOR?

04:12.000 --> 04:14.733
- NEVER MIND.

04:14.733 --> 04:17.100
- WHO, FRANK?

04:17.100 --> 04:20.067
HARRIET LICHTMANN?

04:20.067 --> 04:22.867
- ALL RIGHT, THEN,
HARRIET LICHTMANN.

04:22.867 --> 04:25.733
- I WOULD NEVER PICK
HARRIET LICHTMANN FOR YOU.

04:25.733 --> 04:29.133
- WHY, BECAUSE THAT MIGHT
MAKE ME HAPPY?

04:29.133 --> 04:31.533
- YOU DISGUST ME!

04:31.533 --> 04:34.167
- I DON'T DISGUST
HARRIET LICHTMANN.

04:35.367 --> 04:37.233
- DON'T YOU TALK TO ME
ANYMORE!

04:37.233 --> 04:39.867
- OHHH, HARRIET, HARRIET.

04:39.867 --> 04:41.467
OH!
HEY!

04:41.467 --> 04:43.900
- GET HARRIET
TO MAKE YOU DINNER!

04:43.900 --> 04:45.900
- HEY, I'M ONLY KIDDING, MARIE!

04:45.900 --> 04:48.033
MAKE ME DINNER!

04:51.167 --> 04:52.800
- AND THAT,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

04:52.800 --> 04:56.733
ANSWERS THE QUESTION,
"WHY DO WE DRINK?"

05:05.100 --> 05:06.633
- HELLO.

05:07.867 --> 05:10.000
- HELLO.

05:12.300 --> 05:15.500
- SO WHO WOULD YOU PICK FOR ME
IF YOU DIED FIRST?

05:15.500 --> 05:17.433
- OHH.

05:18.600 --> 05:23.033
AND YOU SAY I'M BAD
AT FOREPLAY.

05:23.033 --> 05:25.433
- COME ON, RAY.
I'M JUST CURIOUS.

05:25.433 --> 05:27.700
IF YOU DIED,
WHO WOULD I GET?

05:27.700 --> 05:30.167
- COME ON, NOW YOU'RE
THINKIN' LIKE MY MOTHER?

05:30.167 --> 05:33.800
- NO. BUT, YOU KNOW,
YOU GOT TO ADMIT,

05:33.800 --> 05:35.233
IN HER OWN WEIRD WAY,

05:35.233 --> 05:40.433
IT WAS KIND OF A LOVING,
CARETAKING THOUGHT.

05:40.433 --> 05:41.600
- OR...

05:41.600 --> 05:46.167
IS IT A WAY TO CONTROL MY FATHER
FROM THE GRAVE?

05:46.167 --> 05:48.700
- COME ON, RAY.
WHO WOULD YOU PICK FOR ME?

05:48.700 --> 05:50.567
- NO. WHY? WHY DO WE
HAVE TO DO THIS?

05:50.567 --> 05:52.633
- IT'S JUST
AN INTERESTING GAME.

05:52.633 --> 05:54.867
IT WILL SHOW
HOW WELL YOU KNOW ME,

05:54.867 --> 05:56.100
HOW MUCH YOU UNDERSTAND ME.

05:56.100 --> 05:58.000
JUST PLAY.
JUST PLAY.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.367
WHO WOULD YOU PICK
TO REPLACE YOU?

06:00.367 --> 06:04.100
- I CONSIDER MYSELF
IRREPLACEABLE.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.967
- I PICKED SOMEONE
TO REPLACE ME.

06:08.967 --> 06:10.133
- YEAH? WHO?

06:10.133 --> 06:12.600
- MARGARET STEVENS.
- WHO?

06:12.600 --> 06:14.300
- THE KIDS' PRESCHOOL TEACHER.

06:14.300 --> 06:16.433
I THINK SHE'S PERFECT FOR YOU.

06:16.433 --> 06:17.867
- PERFECT?

06:17.867 --> 06:21.233
SHE'S GOT TO BE 65 YEARS OLD!

06:21.233 --> 06:23.500
SHE'S OLD ENOUGH
TO BE MY MOTHER!

06:23.500 --> 06:25.600
- I THOUGHT
YOU WOULD LIKE THAT.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.900
- AHH!

06:27.900 --> 06:29.433
HO HO.

06:29.433 --> 06:33.667
YEAH. HOW ABOUT I REPLACE YOU
WITH SOMEBODY NICE?

06:33.667 --> 06:35.200
RELAX, RELAX.

06:35.200 --> 06:36.433
I WAS KIDDING
ABOUT MARGARET.

06:36.433 --> 06:38.067
I PICKED A GOOD PERSON
FOR YOU, REALLY.

06:38.067 --> 06:39.567
- YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:39.567 --> 06:41.900
DON'T TELL ME, OKAY?
I'VE HAD ENOUGH FUN.

06:41.900 --> 06:44.367
- LINDA.

06:44.367 --> 06:46.133
- LINDA?

06:48.833 --> 06:50.567
HMM.

06:54.533 --> 06:55.667
LINDA.

06:55.667 --> 06:57.833
- SEE? DIDN'T I MAKE
A GOOD CHOICE?

06:57.833 --> 06:59.267
AREN'T I THOUGHTFUL?

06:59.267 --> 07:02.067
- YES. YES, YOU ARE.

07:02.067 --> 07:03.967
- YEAH.

07:03.967 --> 07:07.633
SHE'S THE SAME AGE AS ME.
SHE'S SMART, SHE'S FUNNY.

07:07.633 --> 07:09.867
GOOD VALUES--
- EXCELLENT VALUES.

07:09.867 --> 07:13.333
- YEAH, I JUST...

07:13.333 --> 07:15.867
YOU KNOW, I JUST THOUGHT
THAT SHE--

07:15.867 --> 07:18.833
WHAT ARE YOU
GRINNING ABOUT?

07:18.833 --> 07:20.500
- WHAT?

07:20.500 --> 07:21.933
- WHAT'S WITH THE BIG SMILE?

07:21.933 --> 07:24.100
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?

07:24.100 --> 07:26.233
- WHAT? I'M...

07:26.233 --> 07:28.733
I--I GUESS I'M THINKING
ABOUT THE KIDS

07:28.733 --> 07:33.700
AND HOW HAPPY
THEY'LL BE WITH LINDA.

07:33.700 --> 07:36.067
- YOU'RE PICTURING HER NAKED,
AREN'T YOU?

07:36.067 --> 07:38.867
- NO, NO, NO!

07:38.867 --> 07:41.633
NO.

07:44.900 --> 07:48.300
- I KNOW SHE HAS
A GOOD BODY.

07:48.300 --> 07:51.500
- SHE DOES?
I NEVER NOTICED.

07:51.500 --> 07:54.200
- OH, YOU ARE SO,
SO FULL OF IT!

07:54.200 --> 07:55.867
I'M NOT EVEN DEAD YET.

07:55.867 --> 07:58.333
YOU'RE ALREADY FANTASIZING
ABOUT HAVING SEX WITH LINDA.

07:58.333 --> 08:00.600
- I AM NOT! COME ON,
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

08:00.600 --> 08:04.533
- 'CAUSE I KNOW THAT DORKY FACE.
YOU'RE SO TYPICAL!

08:04.533 --> 08:07.700
ALL YOU CARE ABOUT
ARE BOOBS AND BUTTS.

08:07.700 --> 08:11.500
- I COULDN'T CARE LESS
ABOUT BUTTS!

08:13.033 --> 08:14.433
- LOOK AT YOU.

08:14.433 --> 08:15.633
YOU KNOW,
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GO

08:15.633 --> 08:17.300
TO THE MOVIES WITH THEM
TOMORROW NIGHT.

08:17.300 --> 08:19.433
IS THAT THE FACE
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE?

08:20.933 --> 08:23.033
- I'M NOT GONNA MAKE THAT FACE.

08:23.033 --> 08:25.667
I'M GONNA MAKE THIS FACE.

08:27.967 --> 08:29.633
- UGH!

08:29.633 --> 08:31.733
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
THINKING ABOUT LINDA LIKE THIS?

08:31.733 --> 08:34.133
- I HAVEN'T BEEN
THINKING ABOUT HER!

08:34.133 --> 08:36.733
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO BROUGHT HER UP!

08:36.733 --> 08:39.600
COME ON!
LEAVE ME ALONE!

08:42.100 --> 08:45.433
- ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:45.433 --> 08:48.167
I GUESS I'M BEING
A LITTLE SILLY.

08:48.167 --> 08:52.033
- ALL RIGHT, IT'S OKAY.

08:52.033 --> 08:53.933
- SO WHO WOULD YOU
PICK FOR ME?

08:53.933 --> 08:55.600
- OHH.

08:55.600 --> 08:57.267
ARE YOU EVEN
GONNA NEED SOMEBODY?

08:57.267 --> 09:00.367
I MEAN, COULDN'T YOU
JUST GET A CAT?

09:04.933 --> 09:08.800
- LOOK, I MADE A THOUGHTFUL,
UNSELFISH PICK FOR YOU.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.633
NOW YOU HAVE TO PICK
FOR ME.

09:10.633 --> 09:11.667
- ALL RIGHT.

09:11.667 --> 09:14.567
UHHH...
OKAY, WELL, HOW 'BOUT,

09:14.567 --> 09:18.600
IF I GET LINDA,
THEN YOU GET BERNIE?

09:18.600 --> 09:20.067
- BERNIE?

09:20.067 --> 09:22.933
- YEAH. WHAT?
IT'S PERFECT.

09:22.933 --> 09:25.667
- BERNIE?

09:25.667 --> 09:28.900
- WAIT A MINUTE.
I KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

09:28.900 --> 09:30.033
- WHAT?

09:30.033 --> 09:32.100
- HE'S FAT.

09:32.100 --> 09:34.600
- THAT IS NOT THE REASON.
- YES, IT IS.

09:34.600 --> 09:36.933
THERE'S NO REASON YOU SHOULDN'T
BE ATTRACTED TO BERNIE

09:36.933 --> 09:39.800
EXCEPT FOR ALL THE EXTRA BERNIE.

09:39.800 --> 09:41.933
- I DON'T EVEN THINK
HE'S THAT FAT.

09:41.933 --> 09:43.200
- OH, YES, HE IS.

09:43.200 --> 09:44.400
HE KNOWS IT.

09:44.400 --> 09:46.100
WE MAKE FUN OF HIM
ALL THE TIME.

09:46.100 --> 09:49.900
WE CALL HIM "BLIMPY,"
"HINDENBERNIE"...

09:49.900 --> 09:51.700
"FAT BOY."

09:51.700 --> 09:54.700
HE DOESN'T CARE.
HE'S OUR FRIEND,

09:54.700 --> 09:57.233
OUR FATTY-FAT FRIEND.

09:57.233 --> 09:58.600
- IS THAT WHY
YOU PICKED HIM FOR ME,

09:58.600 --> 10:00.400
SO I WOULDN'T BE
ATTRACTED TO HIM?

10:00.400 --> 10:04.400
- YOU SEE? YOU ADMIT IT.
YOU ARE SHALLOW.

10:04.400 --> 10:07.433
- YOU'RE SHALLOW!
I MENTION LINDA'S NAME.

10:07.433 --> 10:09.533
TWO SECONDS LATER,
YOU'RE HAVING SEX WITH HER.

10:09.533 --> 10:11.467
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO MADE UP
THE STUPID GAME!

10:11.467 --> 10:13.267
- IT'S NOT A STUPID GAME!
- IT IS A STUPID GAME!

10:13.267 --> 10:14.833
- OH, YOU'RE STUPID!
- YOU'RE STUPID!

10:14.833 --> 10:16.767
- STUPID!
- STUPID STUPID!

10:22.967 --> 10:24.800
I'LL SHOW YOU.
I'LL DIE FIRST!

10:24.800 --> 10:26.567
- DEAL.

10:31.667 --> 10:32.600
kids: BYE, MOM!

10:32.600 --> 10:34.733
- HAVE A GOOD DAY.
LOVE YOU.

11:01.567 --> 11:03.967
- COME ON.

11:03.967 --> 11:05.433
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

11:06.600 --> 11:08.967
OH, WHAT,
YOU GOT TO GLUE IT ON TIGHT,

11:08.967 --> 11:12.833
HUH, MILK PEOPLE, HUH?

11:12.833 --> 11:15.067
"OH, LOOK AT ME.

11:15.067 --> 11:16.233
"I WORK FOR
THE MILK COMPANY.

11:16.233 --> 11:19.533
I GLUE THINGS ON TIGHT."

11:19.533 --> 11:21.100
YEAH.

11:33.433 --> 11:34.600
- HERE.

11:35.667 --> 11:38.600
- THANKS. SORRY.

11:39.967 --> 11:42.200
- HERE. HERE.
LET ME.

11:46.867 --> 11:49.133
- THANK YOU.

11:54.033 --> 11:55.900
HOW ABOUT ROBERT?

11:55.900 --> 11:57.033
- WHAT?

11:57.033 --> 11:58.967
- WELL...

11:58.967 --> 12:00.967
I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT,
AND IF I DIED,

12:00.967 --> 12:03.400
I PICK ROBERT
TO REPLACE ME.

12:07.567 --> 12:09.967
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
TOO TALL?

12:09.967 --> 12:11.367
- NO!

12:11.367 --> 12:12.700
HE'S YOUR BROTHER,

12:12.700 --> 12:15.667
AND HE'S MARRYING
MY BEST FRIEND.

12:15.667 --> 12:18.967
- WELL, YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT
WHEN I SAID BERNIE,

12:18.967 --> 12:21.533
SO I GAVE IT
SOME REAL THOUGHT,

12:21.533 --> 12:25.567
AND KNOWING YOU AS A PERSON
OR WHATEVER,

12:25.567 --> 12:27.667
I-I...

12:27.667 --> 12:31.600
YOU KNOW, I THINK I CAME UP
WITH A GOOD CHOICE, ROBERT. NO?

12:31.600 --> 12:34.567
- NO. IT'S--I DON'T EVEN
WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT.

12:34.567 --> 12:35.733
IT'S TOO CREEPY.

12:35.733 --> 12:36.833
- IT'S NOT CREEPY.

12:36.833 --> 12:38.467
HERE'S HOW IT WOULD HAPPEN.

12:38.467 --> 12:40.400
THE FOUR OF US
ARE IN ROBERT'S CAR.

12:40.400 --> 12:43.433
WE GET IN AN ACCIDENT,
AND AMY AND I DIE.

12:43.433 --> 12:44.900
- THAT'S NOT CREEPY?

12:44.900 --> 12:47.133
- NO.
THE BEAUTY OF IT IS,

12:47.133 --> 12:48.533
THE WAY I FIGURE IT,

12:48.533 --> 12:50.867
ROBERT FEELS SO GUILTY
ABOUT HIS DRIVING,

12:50.867 --> 12:54.067
HE'S RENDERED IMPOTENT.

12:58.567 --> 13:02.833
YEAH. OTHERWISE,
IT WOULD BE WEIRD.

13:02.833 --> 13:05.333
- LOOK, I'M SORRY
I BROUGHT THE WHOLE THING UP.

13:05.333 --> 13:07.267
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
PUT YOU ON THE SPOT LIKE THAT,

13:07.267 --> 13:09.100
AND I OVERREACTED
ABOUT YOU WITH LINDA,

13:09.100 --> 13:10.733
'CAUSE SHE'S A GREAT PERSON,

13:10.733 --> 13:13.667
AND I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND WHY
ANYONE WOULD BE HAPPY WITH HER.

13:13.667 --> 13:15.833
- YEAH, I MEAN,
THAT'S ALL THAT WAS.

13:15.833 --> 13:17.200
- YEAH. I KNOW.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.933
- ALL RIGHT.
- ALL RIGHT.

13:18.933 --> 13:21.033
OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.
LINDA CALLED THIS MORNING.

13:21.033 --> 13:22.600
SHE HAD TO CANCEL
OUR DATE TONIGHT.

13:22.600 --> 13:25.600
BERNIE WAS UP ALL NIGHT
WITH A TERRIBLE STOMACH FLU.

13:25.600 --> 13:28.667
HE SLEPT
ON THE BATHROOM FLOOR.

13:28.667 --> 13:30.400
- STOMACH FLU?

13:30.400 --> 13:33.100
THAT'S A LOT OF FLU
WITH THAT STOMACH.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.900
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:37.900 --> 13:39.333
MAYBE TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT

13:39.333 --> 13:40.800
WE SHOULD GO
TO MRS. CAPUTO'S VIEWING--

13:40.800 --> 13:42.400
YOU KNOW,
JUST GET IT OUT OF THE WAY.

13:42.400 --> 13:44.167
- OKAY, THAT'D BE GREAT.

13:44.167 --> 13:46.667
- ALL RIGHT.
I'LL SEE YOU.

13:46.667 --> 13:48.933
- OKAY.

13:48.933 --> 13:50.233
- SO WE'RE GOOD NOW, RIGHT?

13:50.233 --> 13:52.067
- YEAH, WE'RE GOOD.
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

13:52.067 --> 13:53.433
- ALL RIGHT.

14:02.633 --> 14:03.867
- [clears throat]

14:03.867 --> 14:05.900
LINDA. IT'S DEB.

14:05.900 --> 14:07.900
HI.
YEAH, WE DID TOO.

14:07.900 --> 14:10.467
BUT, LISTEN, I'M AFRAID I'M
GONNA HAVE TO CANCEL TONIGHT.

14:10.467 --> 14:15.533
WELL, RAY WAS UP ALL NIGHT
WITH THIS TERRIBLE STOMACH FLU.

14:15.533 --> 14:18.400
HE SLEPT
ON THE BATHROOM FLOOR.

14:21.633 --> 14:26.400
- WE'RE SO SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS, MR. CAPUTO.

14:26.400 --> 14:30.067
- MRS. CAPUTO WILL ALWAYS HAVE
A SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEART.

14:30.067 --> 14:31.200
WHEN WE WERE KIDS,

14:31.200 --> 14:32.433
SHE WOULD ALWAYS
CALL US OVER

14:32.433 --> 14:34.600
FOR HER HOME-BAKED
APPLE PIE.

14:34.600 --> 14:36.233
AND SHE WOULD ALWAYS
CUT ME A SLICE

14:36.233 --> 14:39.067
JUST A LITTLE BIT BIGGER
THAN RAYMOND'S.

14:40.867 --> 14:43.400
SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL PERSON.

14:45.300 --> 14:46.800
- COME ON, FRANK.

14:46.800 --> 14:48.067
- LOOK AT HER.

14:48.067 --> 14:49.533
THAT'S WHO
YOU PICKED FOR ME?

14:49.533 --> 14:51.433
- SIT DOWN HERE.

14:52.933 --> 14:55.733
- IS THAT PICTURE
BEFORE OR AFTER?

15:00.533 --> 15:02.200
- WELL, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU,
MR. CAPUTO,

15:02.200 --> 15:03.733
CONSIDERING
THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

15:03.733 --> 15:05.833
- THANK YOU, ROBERT.
NICE TO MEET YOU, AMY.

15:05.833 --> 15:09.133
- YOU TOO.

15:09.133 --> 15:10.600
- ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S ENOUGH.

15:10.600 --> 15:13.333
- NO, I'LL TELL YOU
WHEN IT'S ENOUGH.

15:16.200 --> 15:18.967
- OH, HELLO, ROBERT.

15:18.967 --> 15:21.233
- AH, MRS. LICHTMANN.

15:31.867 --> 15:33.233
- THERE SHE IS, MARIE.

15:33.233 --> 15:36.100
AH, HARRIET.

15:36.100 --> 15:37.500
- UNBELIEVABLE.

15:37.500 --> 15:40.100
LOOK WHAT SHE'S WEARING
TO A FUNERAL HOME.

15:40.100 --> 15:43.033
STOP LOOKING.

15:43.033 --> 15:44.633
- AND I'LL NEVER FORGET
HOW MRS. CAPUTO

15:44.633 --> 15:47.700
USED TO CUT ME AND ROBERT SLICES
OF HER HOMEMADE APPLE PIE.

15:47.700 --> 15:50.167
BUT SHE ALWAYS USED TO
TAKE ME ASIDE

15:50.167 --> 15:52.600
AND SLIP ME AN EXTRA SLICE
TO TAKE HOME.

15:52.600 --> 15:54.533
- WHAT?

15:59.733 --> 16:01.467
- GEORGE.

16:01.467 --> 16:03.000
OH, GEORGE,
I AM SORRY.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.500
I AM SO SORRY.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.133
- THANK YOU FOR COMING,
MARIE.

16:08.133 --> 16:10.600
- HOW OLD WAS SHE?
- 82.

16:10.600 --> 16:16.033
- 82?
SO YOUNG. SO YOUNG.

16:16.033 --> 16:17.567
- I KNOW, MARIE.

16:17.567 --> 16:20.333
AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING.

16:20.333 --> 16:22.667
YOU TWO SHOULD ENJOY

16:22.667 --> 16:26.567
EVERY MOMENT YOU HAVE
WITH EACH OTHER.

16:36.900 --> 16:40.467
- THAT SHUT 'EM UP.

16:43.233 --> 16:45.100
- HEY, HI.
HI.

16:45.100 --> 16:46.400
- [giggles]

16:46.400 --> 16:49.533
WE CAME ON THE SAME NIGHT.
HOW ABOUT THAT?

16:49.533 --> 16:51.867
- HEY.

16:51.867 --> 16:54.667
OH, RAY.
I'M SORRY--LIPSTICK.

16:54.667 --> 16:57.567
[giggles]

16:57.567 --> 16:59.033
- [sarcastically]
ARE YOU OKAY?

16:59.033 --> 17:00.433
- TICKLES.

17:00.433 --> 17:02.767
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING, RAY?

17:02.767 --> 17:04.433
- WHAT? OH, I'M OKAY.

17:04.433 --> 17:06.800
YOU KNOW, I HADN'T SEEN HER
IN A LONG TIME.

17:06.800 --> 17:07.933
- OH, NO, I MEANT--

17:07.933 --> 17:10.100
- OH, MRS. CAPUTO.

17:10.100 --> 17:12.000
SUCH A SHAME, RIGHT?

17:12.000 --> 17:14.433
SUCH A NICE LADY.
RIGHT, BERNIE?

17:14.433 --> 17:15.800
- YEAH, I'LL MISS HER.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.533
I'LL MISS HER PIES.

17:19.800 --> 17:21.600
- HEY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
YOU LOOK GOOD, THOUGH.

17:21.600 --> 17:23.267
YOU MUST'VE GOT OVER IT
PRETTY QUICK.

17:23.267 --> 17:24.700
- SHE WAS
SUCH A SWEET LADY,

17:24.700 --> 17:27.867
SUCH A WONDERFUL LADY,
AND NOW--

17:27.867 --> 17:31.300
PHTTT!

17:31.300 --> 17:32.600
YOU TWO SHOULD
PAY YOUR RESPECTS.

17:32.600 --> 17:34.267
GEORGE IS
RIGHT OVER THERE.

17:34.267 --> 17:36.267
- CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING,
GEORGE?

17:36.267 --> 17:39.933
MY BOYS LOVED ROSE'S
APPLE PIE SO MUCH,

17:39.933 --> 17:41.300
I USED TO TELL HER

17:41.300 --> 17:43.300
IT'S OKAY TO GIVE RAYMOND
AN EXTRA PIECE.

17:48.533 --> 17:50.900
- HELLO, GEORGE.

17:50.900 --> 17:52.600
- HARRIET.

17:52.600 --> 17:54.000
- WELL, HELLO, HARRIET.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.500
- OH, HELLO, FRANK.

18:01.367 --> 18:03.300
- OH. GEORGE IS FREE NOW.

18:03.300 --> 18:05.867
- HEY, BERNIE,
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SICK.

18:05.867 --> 18:07.933
- ME? I'M HEALTHY AS A HORSE.

18:07.933 --> 18:08.933
YOU'RE THE SICK ONE.

18:08.933 --> 18:10.433
- I'M NOT SICK.

18:10.433 --> 18:13.600
- YOU SPENT THE WHOLE NIGHT
ON THE BATHROOM FLOOR.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.867
- I THOUGHT YOU SPENT
THE WHOLE NIGHT

18:15.867 --> 18:17.000
ON THE BATHROOM FLOOR.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.167
- WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

18:22.700 --> 18:28.167
- HEY, A WONDERFUL LADY
IS IN A BOX OVER THERE.

18:30.600 --> 18:33.767
- SO YOU TELL PEOPLE I SLEEP
ON THE BATHROOM FLOOR?

18:33.767 --> 18:36.167
IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO SEE US,
YOU COULD'VE JUST SAID SO.

18:36.167 --> 18:37.767
- DID WE DO SOMETHING
TO OFFEND YOU?

18:37.767 --> 18:40.067
- NO, NO, NOT AT ALL.

18:40.067 --> 18:41.200
- THEN WHY?

18:41.200 --> 18:42.300
- I THINK
I CAN EXPLAIN IT.

18:42.300 --> 18:43.733
- I THINK YOU SHOULDN'T, RAY.

18:43.733 --> 18:45.033
- DEBRA'S JEALOUS.

18:45.033 --> 18:46.967
- JEALOUS OF WHAT?
- OF LINDA.

18:46.967 --> 18:50.133
- RAY.
- AND ME.

18:50.133 --> 18:51.733
- WHAT?
- NO, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

18:51.733 --> 18:53.233
- REMEMBER THE OTHER NIGHT

18:53.233 --> 18:55.933
WHEN MY PARENTS WERE
TALKING ABOUT FUTURE SPOUSES?

18:55.933 --> 18:57.133
WELL, DEBRA AND I
GOT INTO IT,

18:57.133 --> 18:59.133
AND SHE PICKED LINDA FOR ME,

18:59.133 --> 19:00.133
AND I SAID "FINE."

19:00.133 --> 19:01.833
SHE COULDN'T TAKE IT.

19:01.833 --> 19:05.567
- BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T WIPE
THAT STUPID LOOK OFF HIS FACE.

19:05.567 --> 19:09.033
- YOU WERE PICTURING HER NAKED,
WEREN'T YOU?

19:09.033 --> 19:10.333
- BERNIE!

19:10.333 --> 19:11.800
- NO, COME ON.
THAT'S ALL GUYS DO.

19:11.800 --> 19:13.667
THEY SEE A WOMAN,
THEY PICTURE HER NAKED.

19:13.667 --> 19:16.767
- OH, YEAH?
YOU PICTURE DEBRA NAKED?

19:16.767 --> 19:18.500
- HUH?

19:18.500 --> 19:21.667
NO! NO MORE THAN
YOU'D PICTURE RAY NAKED.

19:21.667 --> 19:23.467
- EWW!

19:23.467 --> 19:25.800
- "EWW?"

19:25.800 --> 19:27.100
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

19:27.100 --> 19:28.933
I WOULD NEVER PICTURE
BERNIE NAKED.

19:28.933 --> 19:31.367
- IT'S BECAUSE I'M HEAVY,
ISN'T IT?

19:31.367 --> 19:32.633
I KNOW I HAVE TROUBLE
WITH WEIGHT.

19:32.633 --> 19:34.267
I HAPPEN TO HAVE
A GLANDULAR PROBLEM.

19:34.267 --> 19:36.667
- I PICKED YOU FOR HER,
BUT SHE DIDN'T WANT YOU.

19:36.667 --> 19:39.000
- RAY, WOULD YOU
STOP SAYING THAT?

19:39.000 --> 19:40.467
- HEY, WHAT'S WITH
ALL THE NOISE?

19:40.467 --> 19:42.267
- JUST NEVER MIND, OKAY?
MIND YOUR BUSINESS.

19:42.267 --> 19:43.733
WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT SOMETHING HERE.

19:43.733 --> 19:48.167
- HI, EVERYBODY.
ISN'T THIS LOVELY?

19:48.167 --> 19:50.633
- DEBRA DECIDED
THAT IF SHE DIES,

19:50.633 --> 19:51.667
RAY SHOULD BE WITH ME.

19:51.667 --> 19:53.267
- YEAH, AND RAY
PICKED ME FOR DEBRA,

19:53.267 --> 19:55.567
BUT APPARENTLY, I'M TOO FAT!

19:58.433 --> 20:01.300
- THAT'S NOT TRUE, BERNIE!

20:01.300 --> 20:02.867
- DID DEBRA EVEN
CONSIDER ME?

20:02.867 --> 20:05.267
- HEY, I'M RIGHT HERE!

20:05.267 --> 20:06.667
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, AMY.

20:06.667 --> 20:08.400
ROBERT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH
FOR HER EITHER.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.000
- WHAT'S WRONG
WITH ROBERT?

20:10.000 --> 20:13.433
- EXCUSE ME; YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO LOWER YOUR VOICES.

20:13.433 --> 20:14.833
- I'M NOT GONNA
TELL YOU AGAIN.

20:14.833 --> 20:16.267
YOU STAY AWAY
FROM MY HUSBAND.

20:16.267 --> 20:17.733
- MARIE, WE WERE
JUST TALKING.

20:17.733 --> 20:19.167
- NO, YOU WEREN'T
JUST TALKING.

20:19.167 --> 20:22.067
YOU WERE PICTURING HER NAKED.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.167
- GET OUTTA MY HEAD, WOMAN!

20:25.167 --> 20:26.767
- LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, FRANK.

20:26.767 --> 20:28.300
I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOUR DREAMS ARE,

20:28.300 --> 20:29.600
YOU ARE NEVER
GONNA FIND YOURSELF

20:29.600 --> 20:32.033
IN THE ARMS
OF HARRIET LICHTMANN!

20:32.033 --> 20:33.700
- AND LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING, MARIE!

20:33.700 --> 20:35.433
I DON'T CARE
HOW MANY PLANS YOU MAKE,

20:35.433 --> 20:38.700
I WOULDN'T BE CAUGHT DEAD
WITH ROSE CAPUTO!

21:08.033 --> 21:10.900
- THANKS.

21:10.900 --> 21:14.100
WE HAD A GOOD TIME.

21:18.500 --> 21:21.633
- SO WHO WOULD YOU
PICK FOR ME?

21:21.633 --> 21:23.933
- ROBERT,
I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.

21:23.933 --> 21:26.167
- COME ON.
JUST FOR FUN.

21:26.167 --> 21:27.700
- WE'RE NOT EVEN MARRIED YET,

21:27.700 --> 21:29.567
AND YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHO CAN REPLACE ME?

21:29.567 --> 21:31.800
- I PICKED SOMEBODY
TO REPLACE ME.

21:31.800 --> 21:34.333
- OH, YEAH? WHO?

21:34.333 --> 21:37.600
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT...
RAYMOND?

21:37.600 --> 21:39.633
- RAY?

21:39.633 --> 21:41.433
- THAT'S MY GIRL!
