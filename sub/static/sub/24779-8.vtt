00:12.929 --> 00:16.307
[narrator]  Gabe Mitchell chose
Winchester University for his MFA,

00:16.391 --> 00:18.518
thanks to the institution's
storied tradition

00:18.601 --> 00:20.687
in nonfiction filmmaking.

00:20.770 --> 00:23.773
[upbeat 1920s jazz music playing]

00:23.857 --> 00:25.108
[narrator]  1928,

00:25.191 --> 00:27.694
Winchester starts a course
on the photoplay

00:27.777 --> 00:30.238
to document its true history.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.206
And while the term "documentary"

00:40.290 --> 00:41.666
implies a focus on the facts,

00:41.750 --> 00:44.794
the truth is often elusive.

00:46.087 --> 00:47.464
[men chanting]  We are the order.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.507
We are the order.

00:49.591 --> 00:51.134
We are the order.

00:51.217 --> 00:52.844
We are the order.

00:52.927 --> 00:54.512
We are the order.

00:54.596 --> 00:56.514
[man]  We are the unnamed.

00:56.598 --> 00:58.058
We are the unseen.

00:58.141 --> 01:00.185
-We are the order.
-[men]  We are the order.

01:00.268 --> 01:01.936
[man] You can't be here, man! Get out!

01:02.020 --> 01:03.438
[men shouting]

01:03.521 --> 01:07.192
[narrator]  And sometimes the truth dies
with those who dare to tell it.

01:08.443 --> 01:09.360
Sorry I'm late, man.

01:09.444 --> 01:10.904
[Gabe] Yeah, yeah, hey, no worries.

01:11.946 --> 01:14.407
-[Troy] Looking at you, camera...
-[Gabe] Uh, me. Me's perfect.

01:14.491 --> 01:15.658
[Troy]  I was protected from

01:15.742 --> 01:17.494
the kind of stuff you read about
in the news,

01:17.577 --> 01:18.703
at least until recently,

01:18.787 --> 01:21.372
but the stuff I struggle with, it's...

01:21.456 --> 01:23.583
You think people are starving for content?

01:23.666 --> 01:25.794
...it's not the kind of stuff
that you can easily see

01:25.877 --> 01:27.754
or fit in a couple hundred characters.

01:27.837 --> 01:29.547
Try being a cute Trini girl

01:29.631 --> 01:31.883
with a thing for other girls. [laughs]

01:31.966 --> 01:35.011
You want to change things,
don't just talk to me.

01:35.094 --> 01:37.388
I mean, sometimes I think
I'll never get to see myself

01:37.472 --> 01:38.890
in American culture.

01:38.973 --> 01:40.433
Talk to your friends.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.268
Except for this one very specific

01:42.352 --> 01:45.021
possibly illegal porn site.

01:45.104 --> 01:46.356
Don't search it.

01:46.439 --> 01:47.732
[Reggie]  Talk to your family.

01:47.816 --> 01:50.902
Talk to... white people.

01:50.985 --> 01:53.404
One of my white girlfriends
was saying how great it would be

01:53.488 --> 01:55.865
if Michelle and Kamala ran together,

01:55.949 --> 01:57.909
and I got really upset.

01:57.992 --> 02:00.120
It's like, if you have a dog
that bites someone,

02:00.620 --> 02:02.622
even though you didn't bite them
personally,

02:02.705 --> 02:03.873
it's still your fault.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.458
Did you see what happened

02:05.542 --> 02:07.418
when an articulate, well-educated,

02:07.502 --> 02:11.214
scandal-free man with a black father
led this country well for eight years?

02:11.297 --> 02:13.341
Racism is white people's dog.

02:13.466 --> 02:17.804
No, I don't want to see two black women
run together on the same ticket.

02:17.887 --> 02:19.097
And it's been biting.

02:19.180 --> 02:21.683
I don't want to wake up every day
to see how much

02:21.766 --> 02:23.893
this country despises us.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.771
So is that everything that you need?

02:26.855 --> 02:29.149
-[Gabe] Yeah, that was great.
-Thank you.

02:31.317 --> 02:34.195
[narrator]  So how does one find
this elusive truth?

02:34.863 --> 02:35.947
Can you guess?

02:39.409 --> 02:40.827
Watch closely.

03:18.364 --> 03:20.116
[door opens]

03:20.199 --> 03:23.620
[Lionel] So every weekend,
Winchester's very own DJ DJ--

03:23.703 --> 03:25.246
he's a DJ named DJ.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.582
-Anyway, he does a disco set--
-[Wesley] Lionel.

03:28.750 --> 03:33.046
I'm very flattered, but are we really
at the sex tape stage of this?

03:33.129 --> 03:34.088
[laughs]

03:34.172 --> 03:37.926
Uh, Gabe, are--
are we the first ones here?

03:38.009 --> 03:40.094
I'm sorry, Lionel.
I really wanna help cover for you,

03:40.178 --> 03:41.930
but I have no idea
what we're talking about.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.599
-Donna?
-That really doesn't clear it up.

03:45.934 --> 03:48.102
So back to the porn you're making.

03:48.186 --> 03:49.979
What's the series?

03:50.063 --> 03:51.105
College Cuties?

03:51.189 --> 03:52.190
Uh...

03:52.273 --> 03:53.942
-[Wesley]  Dorm Dommes?
-[Lionel laughs]

03:54.025 --> 03:55.193
Professor Pounding?

03:55.276 --> 03:56.653
[Wesley]  Twink Teachers?

03:56.736 --> 03:59.989
-[Lionel] Ooh, I would watch that.
-This is great and really cute, guys,

04:00.073 --> 04:02.116
but, uh, I kind of need the space, so...

04:04.452 --> 04:05.912
Thanks.

04:05.995 --> 04:07.872
And no, there's no story here.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.499
I didn't think so before, but...

04:09.582 --> 04:11.668
[Sam] Donna's every other week, Lionel.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.461
[Lionel] Oh, right.

04:13.544 --> 04:15.380
That's right. I missed last week.

04:15.463 --> 04:17.590
I'm sorry. I must have gotten confused.

04:17.674 --> 04:20.843
[Wesley] It's cool. Just means more time
to level up in  Splatoon.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.808
[door opens]

04:26.891 --> 04:28.101
[Gabe clears throat]

04:28.184 --> 04:29.352
[door closes]

04:30.770 --> 04:31.813
Uh, hi.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.858
-How did you get--
-I, um--

04:35.942 --> 04:37.318
I still have the key you gave me.

04:37.402 --> 04:38.486
Oh.

04:38.569 --> 04:40.113
I should probably get that back.

04:40.196 --> 04:41.406
Yeah, sure.

04:43.199 --> 04:44.951
Thanks.

04:48.204 --> 04:51.124
Uh, so should we...

04:53.251 --> 04:54.294
Huh.

04:55.211 --> 04:56.045
[Gabe] Huh?

04:56.963 --> 04:58.131
Nothing.

04:59.757 --> 05:01.718
Uh, you want to do it
somewhere else, or...

05:01.801 --> 05:03.886
Oh, I mean,

05:04.554 --> 05:07.223
there is a big soundproof booth nearby

05:07.307 --> 05:10.685
that was exclusively meant for recording.

05:13.646 --> 05:17.317
Okay, yeah,
wherever you're more comfortable.

05:18.067 --> 05:20.069
Okay. Cool.

05:25.450 --> 05:26.659
[mocking] "Okay. Cool."

05:28.286 --> 05:29.871
[door rattles]

05:33.875 --> 05:35.293
Sam?

05:35.376 --> 05:36.627
[thumping on door]

05:36.711 --> 05:37.795
Sam-- [sighs]

05:43.384 --> 05:44.385
Oh.

05:44.469 --> 05:46.596
I'm sorry. I had my headphones on.
I didn't realize.

05:46.679 --> 05:47.805
Oh, no worries.

05:52.894 --> 05:57.190
Oh, I don't need any radio station B-roll,
just the interview.

05:57.273 --> 05:58.941
I figured I'd record it for the show.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.109
Wait, why?

06:00.193 --> 06:01.486
Just in case.

06:01.569 --> 06:03.071
Just in case of what?

06:03.154 --> 06:05.656
Like insurance for something? Like if I...

06:05.740 --> 06:08.076
edit you out of context?
'Cause I wouldn't do that.

06:08.743 --> 06:10.286
Not now, you won't.

06:13.081 --> 06:15.333
Testing, testing, one, two, one, two.

06:15.416 --> 06:16.959
[clears throat]

06:21.756 --> 06:23.800
[Gabe and Sam clear throats]

06:24.926 --> 06:25.927
[camera beeps]

06:26.010 --> 06:26.969
[Sam clears throat]

06:27.720 --> 06:28.930
[Gabe clears throat]

06:29.806 --> 06:31.808
-Here with Samantha--
-Welcome to  Dear White People.

06:31.891 --> 06:32.975
This is--

06:34.727 --> 06:35.770
-After you.
-No.

06:35.853 --> 06:37.021
-You can start.
-You sure?

06:37.105 --> 06:38.731
Gabe.

06:39.649 --> 06:41.067
Here I am with Samantha White

06:41.150 --> 06:43.444
of the popular campus radio show
Dear White People.

06:43.528 --> 06:44.779
Thank you for being here.

06:44.862 --> 06:47.323
And I'm here with Gabe Mitchell,

06:47.406 --> 06:49.951
the filmmaker behind  I Can't Believe

06:50.034 --> 06:52.912
He Actually Named
His Documentary   "Am I Racist?"

06:52.995 --> 06:56.499
Oh, I meant filmmaker behind  Am I Racist?

06:56.582 --> 06:57.792
My bad. Typo.

06:57.875 --> 06:59.043
Fucking autocorrect.

06:59.127 --> 07:00.211
Hmm.

07:01.379 --> 07:02.713
Hmm.

07:03.756 --> 07:05.133
Are you gonna ask me a question?

07:05.216 --> 07:07.301
Right. Uh...

07:08.845 --> 07:09.971
-Okay--
-[Sam] It's fine.

07:10.054 --> 07:11.556
[clears throat] I can start.

07:12.390 --> 07:14.392
Gabe, thank you for being here.

07:14.475 --> 07:17.228
I think the first question has to be,

07:17.311 --> 07:20.898
are you aware
of your white savior complex?

07:21.482 --> 07:23.734
-I'm not gonna answer that.
-Great start.

07:23.818 --> 07:25.611
-I don't agree with the premise.
-Of course.

07:25.695 --> 07:28.406
Is culture awash
in white savior narratives? Yes.

07:28.489 --> 07:31.367
Am I unjustly rewarded for doing
the same thing as black people?

07:31.451 --> 07:33.786
Of course. I criticize
that system constantly.

07:33.870 --> 07:36.456
-While capitalizing on it.
-All I did was have a conversation

07:36.539 --> 07:38.499
-with our friend, and--
-Our?

07:39.375 --> 07:43.045
-Not allowed to be friends with Reggie?
-You're not friends. He's your subject.

07:43.129 --> 07:44.046
Meanwhile,

07:44.130 --> 07:46.924
you're getting praised
for doing a version of my show

07:47.008 --> 07:49.177
while Silvio and his alt-right army

07:49.260 --> 07:51.888
have turned my mentions
into a 4chan message board.

07:51.971 --> 07:54.015
I've shouted out  Dear White People
in every piece.

07:54.098 --> 07:55.683
Yeah, and that's somehow worse.

07:55.766 --> 07:58.144
It just means you realize
there's a similarity,

07:58.227 --> 08:00.980
and you're trying to cover your ass.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.357
Why make these shorts?

08:03.441 --> 08:05.985
-No one is making you do this.
-Well, they're for my Documentary

08:06.068 --> 08:07.195
in the Age of YouTube class,

08:07.278 --> 08:11.157
so, technically,
Professor Cartmill is making me do this.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.367
So let's start here.

08:13.451 --> 08:15.119
You don't believe that people should hear

08:15.203 --> 08:18.789
a progressive message about race
from a white person.

08:18.873 --> 08:22.210
I don't believe people should exploit me
and my friends for a grade.

08:22.293 --> 08:23.920
I'm making art about what interests me.

08:24.003 --> 08:25.463
You're capitalizing on the fact

08:25.546 --> 08:29.175
that my message is more palatable coming
from a person who looks like you.

08:29.258 --> 08:31.093
You're Elvis, and I'm Chuck Berry.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.011
Hmm.

08:32.094 --> 08:34.013
One deserved to be
the biggest star in the world,

08:34.096 --> 08:35.515
and the other one got to be.

08:35.598 --> 08:37.099
So this is about recognition for you?

08:37.183 --> 08:38.226
No, it's not.

08:38.309 --> 08:39.769
Because if so, that's fair.

08:39.852 --> 08:43.022
Black culture is mined for the benefit
of white people. I agree with that.

08:43.105 --> 08:45.816
I agree with you on all these issues,
which is why I'm speaking out.

08:45.900 --> 08:49.737
And, in turn, reaping the rewards
of the system you claim to be critiquing,

08:49.820 --> 08:52.573
a system that's not
some distant, separate thing.

08:52.657 --> 08:56.327
It is literally regular people
making decisions.

08:56.410 --> 08:57.912
Some decide to enable it,

08:57.995 --> 08:59.413
and others don't.

08:59.497 --> 09:00.665
Which one are you?

09:00.748 --> 09:02.416
Wouldn't silence be enabling it?

09:02.500 --> 09:05.086
There are ways to speak out
that don't scream "look at me."

09:05.169 --> 09:06.128
Are there?

09:06.212 --> 09:08.881
Because if so, they seem
to have eluded you, no?

09:15.846 --> 09:17.974
So your show is called  Dear White People.

09:18.057 --> 09:20.017
Here I am, a white person
who listens to you,

09:20.101 --> 09:22.520
trying to weaponize my privilege
in order to change things.

09:22.603 --> 09:24.188
Not what you're hoping
to accomplish?

09:24.272 --> 09:27.275
That's not why you're doing this.
You're just doing it to get back at me.

09:27.358 --> 09:29.777
-[camera beeps]
-What are you talking about?

09:29.860 --> 09:32.113
Oh, you know exactly
what I'm talking about.

09:32.196 --> 09:33.239
You're mad.

09:33.322 --> 09:34.740
Maybe you should stop recording.

09:34.824 --> 09:36.784
This is pertinent information
for our audiences.

09:36.867 --> 09:38.911
Is it pertinent that sometimes
you sit in your room,

09:38.995 --> 09:40.746
listen to Reba McEntire and cry?

09:40.830 --> 09:42.081
[console beeps]

09:42.164 --> 09:43.374
Nigga, I trusted you.

09:43.457 --> 09:45.042
Calling you out on the music you like

09:45.126 --> 09:47.086
is way worse than accusing me of sabotage.

09:47.169 --> 09:48.337
You know what you're doing.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.297
I'm sorry.

09:50.172 --> 09:52.967
We said we wouldn't make this personal.
Can we keep our--

09:53.050 --> 09:56.887
-our stuff out of this?
-I said you couldn't make it personal.

09:56.971 --> 09:58.222
I never said I wouldn't.

09:58.306 --> 09:59.932
-That's cute.
-[scoffs]

10:00.349 --> 10:01.934
The only reason I'm doing your doc

10:02.018 --> 10:04.854
is because I wanted to confront you
about your doc.

10:04.937 --> 10:07.148
I know,
and I still wanted to interview you.

10:08.357 --> 10:09.567
Doesn't that say something?

10:11.652 --> 10:12.612
Fine.

10:13.571 --> 10:14.655
Nothing personal.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.365
Great.

10:18.075 --> 10:19.076
[camera beeps]

10:20.828 --> 10:22.663
[both clear throats]

10:22.747 --> 10:25.875
Okay, Sam, let's talk about Silvio.

10:25.958 --> 10:27.543
-Okay.
-So obviously,

10:27.627 --> 10:30.129
after Lionel and  The New Independent
revealed their former editor

10:30.212 --> 10:32.673
was behind the, uh,
controversial AltIvyW account--

10:32.757 --> 10:34.592
It's not a controversial account.

10:34.675 --> 10:36.969
That implies there's an argument
for it, and there's not.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.179
Agreed.

10:38.262 --> 10:39.263
So after Silvio was outed,

10:39.347 --> 10:41.015
he actually got more popular on campus.

10:41.098 --> 10:44.226
It's targeted racism
hiding behind free speech rhetoric.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.353
Again, agreed.

10:45.436 --> 10:48.939
Also contributing to his newfound fame
is the  Medium  post that he wrote

10:49.023 --> 10:50.274
about his so-called evolution

10:50.358 --> 10:53.653
from a liberal social justice warrior
to what he calls "a straight shooter."

10:53.736 --> 10:56.238
Interesting term for "alt-right dickbag."

10:56.322 --> 10:58.115
The article got picked up by Breitbart.

10:58.199 --> 10:59.617
Uh, Rikki Carter dedicated

10:59.700 --> 11:01.160
a whole segment to it on her show.

11:01.243 --> 11:03.454
Missed it. I can never decide
whether to watch Rikki

11:03.537 --> 11:05.706
or the sentient potato
that calls itself Sean Hannity.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.875
Point is, some people

11:07.958 --> 11:11.128
wonder if maybe you bear some
responsibility for his rise.

11:11.212 --> 11:13.798
Some people... or you?

11:13.881 --> 11:14.965
Some people.

11:15.049 --> 11:16.300
Hmm.

11:16.384 --> 11:17.343
Do you have a response?

11:17.426 --> 11:18.761
Yeah, my response is,

11:18.844 --> 11:20.888
are you really going
with "blame the victim"?

11:20.971 --> 11:22.473
I don't blame you for anything.

11:22.556 --> 11:23.557
[coughs] Bullshit.

11:23.641 --> 11:25.017
-I don't.
-Mm.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.895
I'm just asking you to respond
to the sentiment that your show escalated

11:27.978 --> 11:29.563
some of the tensions that led to Silvio.

11:29.647 --> 11:30.773
Honestly, I don't follow.

11:30.856 --> 11:31.941
It's the Batman thing.

11:32.024 --> 11:34.527
He started dressing up as a bat
to fight crime, all of a sudden,

11:34.610 --> 11:37.029
criminals started dressing
like penguins and clowns and...

11:37.113 --> 11:38.447
whatever the hell the Riddler is.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.033
One, Batman didn't come first. Crime did.

11:41.117 --> 11:42.493
Two, he's not real.

11:42.576 --> 11:44.078
Three, if he was real,

11:44.161 --> 11:46.789
in this analogy, he'd be you, not me.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.541
-Oh.
-Don't "oh" me.

11:48.624 --> 11:51.168
Yes, he's a privileged white man
dressed in black

11:51.252 --> 11:53.629
who assumes he can save
those he sees as beneath him,

11:53.712 --> 11:56.382
when really,
he's just making things worse.

11:56.465 --> 11:57.591
Does that sound familiar?

11:57.675 --> 11:58.801
How am I making things worse?

11:58.884 --> 12:03.097
Silvio is what happens when you challenge
an unjust status quo.

12:03.180 --> 12:06.434
The people who benefit from it want
to silence those who want to change it.

12:06.517 --> 12:08.811
If anything, bringing Silvio out
of the woodwork

12:08.894 --> 12:10.187
is a good thing in the long run,

12:10.271 --> 12:15.067
because at least we know who hates us.
It's easier to fight an enemy you can see.

12:15.151 --> 12:16.527
So you acknowledge that your show

12:16.610 --> 12:18.571
opened up these wounds,
and you're happy about it?

12:18.654 --> 12:19.947
[console and camera beep]

12:21.073 --> 12:22.825
Where are you even going with this?

12:23.826 --> 12:26.662
You know I'm not responsible for Silvio.

12:26.745 --> 12:27.997
You know that.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.041
Fuck.

12:31.792 --> 12:33.377
You don't even believe that.

12:34.211 --> 12:35.671
I'm not trying to trick you, Sam.

12:38.007 --> 12:39.592
Just trust me, okay?

12:42.553 --> 12:43.429
[console beeps]

12:44.972 --> 12:46.140
[camera beeps]

12:48.976 --> 12:50.978
[sighs] So how does it make you feel?

12:51.562 --> 12:53.898
The trolling, the blame
you're getting for all of this?

12:54.398 --> 12:56.567
It's a part of being on the Internet,

12:56.650 --> 13:00.362
like porn or videos of animals
that act like people.

13:00.446 --> 13:01.739
It must hurt, though.

13:02.781 --> 13:04.158
Do you want it to hurt?

13:04.241 --> 13:05.826
I want you to know
how it makes you feel.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.536
The oppressed are always being blamed

13:07.620 --> 13:09.747
for calling out the nature
of their oppression.

13:09.830 --> 13:12.833
That's a really good answer to a question,
just not my question.

13:13.834 --> 13:16.170
How does it feel to be a target?

13:21.217 --> 13:22.676
It hurts.

13:23.844 --> 13:25.179
Okay?

13:25.679 --> 13:26.972
Is that what you wanted to hear?

13:27.056 --> 13:28.974
-It was, actually.
-Sadist.

13:29.058 --> 13:30.893
Sam, I'm just wondering
if these trolls see you

13:30.976 --> 13:33.604
as this invincible badass
that they can't get to,

13:33.687 --> 13:35.064
so they keep escalating.

13:35.147 --> 13:36.190
If people realized--

13:36.273 --> 13:38.526
They want to hurt my feelings.
That is the point.

13:38.609 --> 13:40.569
Admitting it is giving them
what they want.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.821
Why can't you use your platform
to tell people

13:42.905 --> 13:45.032
how much it hurts,
to really be vulnerable?

13:45.115 --> 13:46.575
Who are you to tell what I should do?

13:46.659 --> 13:48.327
If you were interested in reaching people,

13:48.410 --> 13:50.830
maybe you'd let them in.
You'd express yourself honestly.

13:50.913 --> 13:53.874
Wouldn't hide behind this veil of anger
that's only a small part of who you are.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.626
I didn't hear a question there.

13:55.709 --> 13:57.169
-I'm just saying--
-What I heard

13:57.253 --> 13:58.629
was a reprimand

13:58.712 --> 14:02.132
about how I should process my experience.

14:02.216 --> 14:05.886
You don't get to tell me
that my anger isn't honest.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.346
Your anger isn't all that you are.

14:07.429 --> 14:09.139
Is this a movement or a primal scream?

14:09.223 --> 14:10.099
Both.

14:11.016 --> 14:12.601
You're so full of shit, Gabe.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.479
You think you're coming at this
from some objective

14:15.563 --> 14:17.356
journalistic place, and you're not.

14:17.439 --> 14:20.276
You think this entire school
being fucked up is my fault.

14:20.359 --> 14:23.153
You think everything is my fault.

14:23.237 --> 14:24.488
Why?

14:25.239 --> 14:26.323
Oh.

14:26.907 --> 14:28.158
Because you're hurt.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.286
Or maybe because some of it is your fault.

14:30.369 --> 14:31.412
And there it is.

14:31.495 --> 14:33.622
-I didn't mean that. It's just--
-[console beeps]

14:34.999 --> 14:36.709
[sighs]

14:37.376 --> 14:39.795
You were the one who sent the invite
to the blackface party.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.631
From the guy who called the cops.
Fuck you!

14:50.055 --> 14:51.891
You can't just run away
from a conversation

14:51.974 --> 14:55.102
-because you don't like where it's going.
-Why not? Isn't that what you did?

14:55.185 --> 14:56.228
What are you talking about?

14:56.812 --> 14:58.981
You abandoned me on one
of the worst nights of my life.

14:59.064 --> 15:00.482
The protest was falling apart,

15:00.566 --> 15:01.567
everyone was blaming me,

15:01.650 --> 15:05.154
and then you show up and decide, "Hey,
let me break up with Sam,

15:05.237 --> 15:07.114
and while I'm at it,
why not do it in public,

15:07.197 --> 15:09.033
-and then let me grill her...
-Oh, okay.

15:09.116 --> 15:10.200
...a fucking month later."

15:10.284 --> 15:11.410
We're gonna forget about--

15:11.493 --> 15:14.413
Do you know how hard it was
for me to say "I love you"?

15:14.872 --> 15:17.207
I had never said that
to anyone before you, not once!

15:17.291 --> 15:18.375
You fucked Reggie.

15:19.293 --> 15:21.378
-You didn't even apologize for it.
-What?

15:21.462 --> 15:22.922
You heard me.

15:23.005 --> 15:25.382
-I totally ap--
-You didn't!

15:26.091 --> 15:27.009
Well...

15:27.801 --> 15:29.887
why should I have to?

15:29.970 --> 15:30.846
Oh, come on!

15:30.930 --> 15:33.182
We weren't technically together
when that happened.

15:33.265 --> 15:36.018
Oh, I'm so sick of you
hiding behind technicalities!

15:36.101 --> 15:37.603
If you'd have asked any of your friends

15:37.686 --> 15:39.063
and my friends if we were together,

15:39.146 --> 15:40.606
they would've said yes.

15:40.689 --> 15:42.608
You fucked up!
But you won't admit it,

15:42.691 --> 15:45.152
'cause that would make you wrong.
God forbid that ever happens.

15:45.235 --> 15:46.236
[Sam] Okay.

15:46.320 --> 15:47.821
-You know what, Gabe?
-Hmm.

15:47.905 --> 15:51.659
You act like you're this nice guy,
like because you say all the right things,

15:51.742 --> 15:52.785
you're beyond reproach,

15:52.868 --> 15:54.536
but you know what the truth is?

15:54.954 --> 15:55.955
You're an asshole.

15:56.038 --> 15:57.498
How am I an asshole?

15:57.581 --> 15:59.041
Because you broke up with me

15:59.124 --> 16:01.752
and you won't get the fuck out of my life!

16:01.835 --> 16:03.253
You're a grad student.

16:03.337 --> 16:05.464
Why are you hanging out
with all these 20-year-olds?

16:05.547 --> 16:07.549
Just because your friends
are head-up-their-ass

16:07.633 --> 16:08.884
hipster garbage people

16:08.968 --> 16:10.803
does not mean you have to hang out
with mine.

16:10.886 --> 16:12.304
-That is so unfair.
-Uh-huh.

16:12.388 --> 16:14.932
Your documentary is literally
a tour through my friends,

16:15.015 --> 16:16.892
and now you're hanging out with Joelle,

16:16.976 --> 16:18.018
all shady and shit?

16:18.102 --> 16:22.523
It's like you want to rub the breakup
in my face over and over!

16:22.606 --> 16:25.401
Joelle and I are friends.
I'm sorry we enjoy each other's company.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.403
What about the flirting
with Jamila in doc class?

16:27.486 --> 16:28.862
-What?
-Is that so you can assert

16:28.946 --> 16:30.072
you were the one who hurt me?

16:30.155 --> 16:31.657
-No.
-Does it make you feel big?

16:31.740 --> 16:32.908
-No.
-Does all of this

16:32.992 --> 16:35.285
-make you feel big?
-No!

16:35.869 --> 16:37.579
Then what's with this?

16:37.663 --> 16:40.749
The hair and the face and the real shoes.

16:40.833 --> 16:43.210
Is this your "I'm over Sam" look?

16:43.293 --> 16:46.338
Mm-hmm. Yeah, 'cause if I shave my face
and cut my hair,

16:46.422 --> 16:47.756
must be all about you.

16:47.840 --> 16:48.716
Narcissist.

16:48.799 --> 16:50.259
[laughing] Oh, right.

16:50.342 --> 16:52.302
I'm the narcissist.

16:52.386 --> 16:56.015
Well, for the record, me fucking Reggie
had nothing to do with you.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.100
Not everything has to do with you.

16:58.183 --> 17:00.310
-Mm.
-I am a grown-ass woman.

17:00.394 --> 17:02.604
I get to choose who I sleep with.

17:02.688 --> 17:05.733
I get to choose how I exist in this world,

17:05.816 --> 17:08.152
and who are you to tell me I'm wrong?

17:08.527 --> 17:12.239
Who cares
if our friends "saw us" as together?

17:12.322 --> 17:14.992
We weren't official until we said we were.

17:15.075 --> 17:16.702
Just a reminder, I was at a pep rally,

17:16.785 --> 17:19.163
trying to support your cause,
while you were fucking Reggie.

17:19.246 --> 17:22.041
[Sam laughs] Right. My cause.

17:22.124 --> 17:24.835
And here you are, at the center of it.

17:28.047 --> 17:28.922
[growls]

17:29.006 --> 17:32.134
You see, this right here?
This is your problem!

17:32.217 --> 17:34.970
Your walls are so fucking high,
and you're so afraid to bring them down

17:35.054 --> 17:37.639
that you will push anyone and everyone
that you care about away

17:37.723 --> 17:40.017
just so you can stay mad
at the world forever!

17:40.100 --> 17:41.268
[Sam laughs]

17:41.351 --> 17:42.436
Yeah?

17:44.104 --> 17:46.356
Well, you're gonna end up
with some black chick

17:46.440 --> 17:48.901
who you convinced yourself you love

17:48.984 --> 17:51.153
just so you can use
your relationship with her

17:51.236 --> 17:53.530
to atone for your white guilt.

17:53.614 --> 17:55.407
Of course I have white guilt!

17:55.949 --> 17:58.327
I think about that party every day!

17:58.410 --> 18:00.120
What that call to the cops meant
for Reggie,

18:00.204 --> 18:02.498
how oblivious I was to make it
in the fucking first place.

18:02.581 --> 18:05.250
Well, that's too fucking bad.
It's not my job to absolve you.

18:05.334 --> 18:07.586
Then stop acting like it's your job!

18:08.587 --> 18:10.672
I'm not asking for your absolution.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.884
You're the one who lords it over me.

18:15.803 --> 18:18.472
You know, your friends are
constantly tiptoeing around you

18:18.555 --> 18:20.307
and your feelings and your opinions

18:20.390 --> 18:24.103
because you've made yourself
judge and jury about every issue.

18:24.186 --> 18:27.356
[sighs] I know because, unlike you,
I've actually taken the time

18:27.439 --> 18:29.024
to listen to them.

18:29.983 --> 18:32.194
-Bullshit.
-And not for nothing,

18:32.277 --> 18:34.905
your white guilt is the only reason
why you do  Dear White People.

18:34.988 --> 18:37.783
You overcompensate for the part
of you that you hate.

18:40.285 --> 18:41.829
[Gabe sighs]

18:47.543 --> 18:49.169
[door opens]

18:50.003 --> 18:51.338
[door closes]

18:52.005 --> 18:54.049
[sighs]

18:56.260 --> 18:58.011
Look at me.

18:59.763 --> 19:01.515
Do you think I get
to go out into the world

19:01.598 --> 19:02.975
half the time as a white girl

19:03.058 --> 19:05.519
and the other half as a black girl?

19:05.602 --> 19:07.020
I'm black.

19:07.104 --> 19:10.440
In this society,
that is what I am, period.

19:10.941 --> 19:12.651
I have

19:12.734 --> 19:15.821
and continue to feel a lot of things
over being something other

19:15.904 --> 19:19.032
than what fits into a fucking census box.

19:19.491 --> 19:21.910
Guilt is too simple
for what a girl like me

19:21.994 --> 19:24.121
in a world like this feels.

19:24.705 --> 19:27.124
And no one asked for you to feel guilty.

19:27.207 --> 19:30.002
The only thing that brings is platitudes,

19:30.085 --> 19:31.545
kind words

19:31.628 --> 19:34.423
and a huge box office
for movies about sad,

19:34.506 --> 19:35.883
downtrodden black people.

19:35.966 --> 19:38.635
No, what I need from you
and everyone who benefits

19:38.719 --> 19:39.970
from this thing called whiteness

19:40.053 --> 19:42.681
is to acknowledge
that it is a fabrication...

19:42.764 --> 19:47.060
-I am, I do. I constantly acknowledge--
-...do the actual work to dismantle it.

19:47.144 --> 19:48.395
Get on the front lines.

19:48.478 --> 19:50.856
Put yourself in real fucking danger.

19:51.315 --> 19:53.734
You talk on the radio.
I'm talking in my documentary.

19:53.817 --> 19:55.110
You're getting trolled.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.154
How are you in danger? This isn't Selma!

19:57.237 --> 19:58.572
Trolled?

20:00.824 --> 20:01.867
[Sam sighs]

20:15.672 --> 20:16.840
The other day...

20:17.466 --> 20:18.842
I got an email.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.429
It said, "Sorry for your loss."

20:23.430 --> 20:25.599
Now, you know how my dad's
been a little sick.

20:25.682 --> 20:28.101
-Oh, wait, is he--
-He's fine.

20:29.770 --> 20:33.690
He had a bout with arrhythmia,
but he's... totally fine.

20:35.108 --> 20:36.610
But of course,

20:37.152 --> 20:38.987
I thought it was about him.

20:39.947 --> 20:41.240
My heart dropped.

20:41.865 --> 20:43.909
[sighs] This was it,

20:43.992 --> 20:46.870
the "you've got to go home" email.

20:46.954 --> 20:48.413
So I opened it.

20:49.373 --> 20:50.457
Turned out,

20:50.540 --> 20:53.835
it was one of those dumb
animated e-cards, you know?

20:55.671 --> 20:57.589
And on the front of it, it said,

20:57.673 --> 21:00.008
"Gone to a better place."

21:01.051 --> 21:05.097
So now I'm freaking out.

21:05.681 --> 21:06.807
Am I really

21:06.890 --> 21:08.976
finding out about my dad

21:09.434 --> 21:11.687
in a fucking e-card?

21:13.272 --> 21:16.441
So I clicked it.

21:18.986 --> 21:21.905
But it wasn't about my dad at all.

21:23.490 --> 21:26.994
It was addressed to my dad

21:27.077 --> 21:28.328
and my mom,

21:28.412 --> 21:30.163
and I was cc'd...

21:31.707 --> 21:34.001
and it said...

21:36.461 --> 21:40.257
It said, "Sorry to hear
about Sam's accident.

21:41.174 --> 21:43.844
It was her fault

21:43.927 --> 21:46.513
for being a racist nigger."

21:48.640 --> 21:53.645
The irony of calling someone
a racist nigger was lost on him.

21:54.271 --> 21:55.355
[Sam sniffling]

22:01.278 --> 22:02.696
I'm sorry.

22:04.573 --> 22:06.575
[Sam sniffles] Yeah, me too.

22:10.829 --> 22:13.874
[Sam crying]

22:13.957 --> 22:16.335
[sighs] Did you, uh-- did you report him?

22:19.338 --> 22:22.758
It was a dummy email address, so...

22:23.884 --> 22:25.260
there's no point.

22:34.353 --> 22:35.479
[Sam] So yeah,

22:36.354 --> 22:38.815
you presume to know my experience

22:38.899 --> 22:40.734
as a black woman through...

22:41.318 --> 22:43.612
a self-serving lens...

22:44.237 --> 22:46.865
because you have
a personal history with me,

22:46.948 --> 22:48.909
and for what?

22:48.992 --> 22:51.036
So you can cut me up and...

22:51.119 --> 22:55.040
put me out into the world
as this antihero,

22:55.123 --> 22:57.542
get your A, get your accolades

22:57.626 --> 22:59.753
and graduate.

23:02.255 --> 23:04.633
You are the system, Gabe.

23:06.676 --> 23:08.428
[sighs] Oh, fuck.

23:09.638 --> 23:11.431
And for the record,

23:11.515 --> 23:14.476
I knew where this was going
from the start.

23:15.811 --> 23:17.312
You wanted me to admit

23:17.395 --> 23:20.273
that my pain had become
my identity, but...

23:21.650 --> 23:23.318
Have you heard of epigenetics?

23:24.111 --> 23:25.320
Uh, no.

23:25.403 --> 23:26.655
Hmm.

23:31.660 --> 23:33.161
Are you gonna tell me what it is?

23:33.245 --> 23:34.246
Yeah.

23:35.330 --> 23:37.707
Joelle was talking about it the other day.

23:38.708 --> 23:41.503
Shit. What was she saying?

23:42.087 --> 23:43.713
Oh, right.

23:43.797 --> 23:45.966
It's the inheritance of pain.

23:46.591 --> 23:49.386
Basically, scientists
have figured out that...

23:49.469 --> 23:51.721
people who experience intense trauma,

23:51.805 --> 23:54.683
like slavery, pass that down
through their DNA,

23:54.766 --> 23:57.644
so pain and suffering

23:57.727 --> 23:59.855
is literally in my blood.

24:00.272 --> 24:01.898
How do you spell that?

24:02.524 --> 24:04.484
-Why?
-Well, I'm googling it.

24:04.568 --> 24:06.695
You don't need to google it.
I told you what it is.

24:06.778 --> 24:08.780
Minute ago, you didn't
remember where you heard it.

24:08.864 --> 24:11.533

24:36.641 --> 24:39.936

24:41.521 --> 24:43.690

27:21.723 --> 27:22.932

not ideal.

[both laugh]

27:35.820 --> 27:37.906
