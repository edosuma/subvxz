WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:03.330
Previously on Farscape.

00:03.421 --> 00:05.662
You will never get the
wormhole tech from me.

00:05.756 --> 00:08.668
| merely want to safeguard it,

00:08.759 --> 00:14.220
and hope that when the
inevitable Scarran
bloodbath begins,

00:14.307 --> 00:16.138
you make the
appropriate choices.

00:16.225 --> 00:18.432
Oh, so you're here to be
John's protector.

00:18.519 --> 00:23.730
Crichton:
Scorpius is here, looking
for the key to what is inside my head.

00:23.816 --> 00:29.061
He will use you and the
baby and I will not be
able to stop him.

00:29.155 --> 00:31.771
D'Argo, Rygel and Scorpius
are boarding Lo'La.

00:31.866 --> 00:33.822
I gotta go. I gotta go
look after Scorpius.

00:33.910 --> 00:35.150
We should do it together.

00:35.244 --> 00:37.576
No, you know we can't
do that together.

00:37.663 --> 00:39.324
Besides, you gotta look
after the girls.

00:39.415 --> 00:40.530
That's not fun.

00:40.625 --> 00:42.957
It's more fun than mental arts
training camp.

00:43.044 --> 00:46.002
Scorpius:
Grayza does not want Earth.

00:46.088 --> 00:50.172
Grayza wants you.

00:50.259 --> 00:52.124
Why do | always attract
the psychos?

00:52.220 --> 00:54.336
Grayza:
Braca, prepare the Marauders.

00:54.430 --> 00:56.716
Set course for our meeting
with the Scarrans.

00:56.807 --> 00:58.513
Yes, ma'am.

00:58.601 --> 01:00.182
What shall I do?

01:00.269 --> 01:03.261
Stall her, Braca.

01:03.356 --> 01:09.522
I'm not given to exaggeration,
but the future of Peacekeeper
survival depends on you.

01:11.239 --> 01:13.946
And now, on Farscape.

01:14.033 --> 01:15.944
D'Argo:
Rygel, what is wrong with you?

01:16.035 --> 01:18.947
I don't think I've ever seen
you not eat for so long.

01:19.038 --> 01:23.907
I'm learning self-discipline
that Katoya taught me.

01:24.001 --> 01:26.162
Besides, none of you can cook.

01:26.254 --> 01:27.790
Well you could cook
for yourself.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.461
I really should cook
something for the girls.

01:29.548 --> 01:31.800
They're due back. They'll be
hungry when they get here.

01:31.884 --> 01:34.500
They are overdue, I believe.

01:36.389 --> 01:38.345
Chiana:
You brought us to a
dead Leviathan?

01:38.432 --> 01:42.471
Sikozu:
The carcass has been fused to
this planetoid to house a commerce settlement.

01:42.561 --> 01:46.145
Aeryn:
It's an unimpressive
settlement. I doubt we'll find what we're looking for.

01:46.232 --> 01:51.272
If we want to camouflage Moya
against long-range scans,
this is the place.

01:51.362 --> 01:53.102
Chiana:
Well, it doesn't look like it.

01:53.197 --> 01:58.362
Well, if you were selling
outlawed mods, would you want
everyone knowing about it?

01:58.452 --> 02:00.408
See these humble stores?

02:00.496 --> 02:03.863
They also sell genetic
transformations,

02:03.958 --> 02:08.793
species blending, and all
the appropriate documents
to go with it.

02:08.879 --> 02:10.870
( spitting )

02:10.965 --> 02:14.753
100% natural, my tul-lum.
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

02:14.844 --> 02:16.084
This way, come on.

02:16.178 --> 02:17.793
Hey, hey, hey.

02:17.888 --> 02:21.016
We want to speak to Rekka.

02:21.100 --> 02:26.390
Sure you've stumbled onto the
right... dead Leviathan?

02:26.480 --> 02:29.643
I know you are his negotiator.

02:29.734 --> 02:33.898
And I also know you make your
deals in this pile of dren.

02:33.988 --> 02:38.197
Perhaps you'd like a
private table.

02:41.829 --> 02:44.445
First round on the house.

02:44.540 --> 02:46.121
Care to hear our specials?

02:46.208 --> 02:49.541
Sikozu:
Not unless you have a discount
on sensor distorters.

02:49.628 --> 02:51.710
Sensual consorters?

02:51.797 --> 02:54.209
Is that some sort of
pleasure toy?

02:54.300 --> 02:55.836
(chuckling)

02:55.926 --> 03:00.135
Look, I know you have to check
us out. That's yourjob.
That's fine.

03:00.222 --> 03:04.591
But now that you know that I
know what I'm talking about,

03:04.685 --> 03:08.143
| suggest you start
taking us seriously.

03:08.230 --> 03:10.016
I'd love to take you.

03:10.107 --> 03:11.142
Seriously.

03:11.233 --> 03:13.269
(sighs)
(chuckling)

03:13.361 --> 03:16.319
Won't your grandmother object?

03:18.032 --> 03:21.524
Don't drink them.
They're drugged.

03:21.619 --> 03:23.610
Sikozu:
A suggestibility
potion, perhaps?

03:23.704 --> 03:26.491
Such an old trick.

03:26.582 --> 03:29.324
My apologies to you.

03:29.418 --> 03:32.251
And professional admiration
for your skills.

03:32.338 --> 03:36.126
Sikozu:
Thank you.
May we see Rekka now?

03:40.096 --> 03:43.634
Tell me what you need.
What do you want?

03:43.724 --> 03:48.809
Sikozu:
We need a sensor distorter
for our ship, to fool long-range scans.

03:48.896 --> 03:51.057
And what do you want
to look like?

03:51.148 --> 03:52.308
An ore freighter.

03:52.400 --> 03:56.313
Chiana:
A fast pleasure yacht
with a jacuzzi.

03:56.404 --> 04:00.238
Aeryn:
What about several choices
of energy signatures?

04:00.324 --> 04:02.235
(snaps fingers)

04:02.326 --> 04:05.818
Well I'll need to check your
sensor modulator.

04:05.913 --> 04:09.405
Do you ladies know what
that looks like?

04:10.793 --> 04:13.250
Chiana:
Gee... I guess we do.

04:15.297 --> 04:18.255
That's partly organic.
Leviathan.

04:18.342 --> 04:20.253
Very good.

04:20.344 --> 04:24.838
Distorter will only fool a
warship if your movements
exactly match your new identity.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.217
Is your Pilot that good?

04:27.518 --> 04:28.883
(weak chuckle)

04:28.978 --> 04:31.310
Your problem, not mine.

04:31.397 --> 04:33.854
Leviathans need custom builds.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.227
I'm going to have to
take your modulator.

04:36.318 --> 04:38.229
That'll leave Moya half-blind.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.936
It'll take four arns.
-Four?

04:41.031 --> 04:43.363
And 19,000 crinders.
-What?!

04:43.451 --> 04:48.070
And we'll give you some
complimentary tokens to the
facilities of your choice.

04:54.837 --> 04:56.668
How about...

04:56.755 --> 04:59.667
I offer you some
complimentary choices?

04:59.758 --> 05:01.749
Would that lower your price?

05:01.844 --> 05:03.300
30,000.

05:03.387 --> 05:04.467
(chuckling)

05:04.555 --> 05:07.217
And if it's that, 40,000.

05:09.351 --> 05:10.682
Be nice.

05:10.769 --> 05:12.509
16,000.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.562
Half up front.

05:18.444 --> 05:20.435
Meet us at your Pod.

05:20.529 --> 05:21.644
Do you know where it is?

05:21.739 --> 05:23.604
Yes, we know where it is.

05:23.699 --> 05:25.439
Be there in four arns.

05:25.534 --> 05:26.910
That's too long.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.656
Our deal, our rules.

05:29.747 --> 05:33.114
Take these tokens and enjoy
yourselves in the meantime.

05:37.213 --> 05:38.453
Chiana:
Do we trust them?

05:38.547 --> 05:39.582
Sikozu:
Of course not.

05:39.673 --> 05:40.583
What do we do?

05:40.674 --> 05:42.665
Just keep an eye on them, Chi.

06:02.613 --> 06:05.104
16,000 crinders. Not bad.

06:05.199 --> 06:06.154
Not bad at all.

06:06.242 --> 06:07.652
Now what?

06:07.743 --> 06:09.654
Wait a minute. Where's Noranti?

06:11.539 --> 06:14.246
Oh, frell. Get down.
There's Peacekeepers.

06:15.334 --> 06:17.245
What? How many?

06:21.382 --> 06:24.294
Grayza, Braca, four SSDs.

06:24.385 --> 06:28.128
No, they could not have followed
us here. That is impossible.

06:28.222 --> 06:30.679
Unless someone tipped them.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.551
You are sure they're
coming, ma'am?

06:36.230 --> 06:38.562
Of course I'm sure.

06:38.649 --> 06:40.605
Keep searching.

06:40.693 --> 06:42.308
Keep searching.

06:47.992 --> 06:51.905
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

06:51.996 --> 06:55.488
Three years ago I got shot
through a wormhole.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.369
I'm in a distant part
of the universe

06:57.459 --> 07:00.667
aboard this living ship of
escaped prisoners,

07:00.754 --> 07:02.540
my friends.

07:03.632 --> 07:05.418
I've made enemies.

07:05.509 --> 07:08.751
Powerful, dangerous.

07:08.846 --> 07:12.338
Now all I want is to
find a way home

07:12.433 --> 07:15.175
to warn Earth.

07:15.269 --> 07:20.354
Look upward and share
the wonders I've seen.

07:59.313 --> 08:01.099
Chiana?

08:01.190 --> 08:02.896
Chiana, can you hear me?

08:02.983 --> 08:05.224
( static )

08:05.319 --> 08:07.526
Why are the Comms frelled?

08:07.613 --> 08:10.104
Sikozu:
Peacekeepers must've jammed
them, Aeryn.

08:10.199 --> 08:12.941
We need to stick together.

08:13.035 --> 08:15.242
Aeryn:
One weapon I have. Six of them.

08:15.329 --> 08:18.742
Sikozu:
And two outlaws who are
on the same side.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.828
Noranti, there are six
Peacekeepers.

08:21.919 --> 08:24.331
Grayza, Braca, four
SSD commandos.

08:24.421 --> 08:26.286
Can you find Chiana
? Can you warn her?

08:26.382 --> 08:28.748
We've got four long arns
to stay low.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.423
Yes, yes, of course.

08:30.511 --> 08:33.298
As I see it we have
several choices.

08:33.389 --> 08:36.472
We can follow Grayza,
find out what she's up to,

08:36.558 --> 08:39.140
or we can stay out of sight.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.659
Say.

09:07.965 --> 09:10.627
May I serve you?
-Yeah.

09:10.718 --> 09:13.926
I'm just looking for two
gentleman that just came
through here.

09:14.012 --> 09:16.298
One's tall, dark hair.

09:16.390 --> 09:20.474
The other one's, um, bald on
top, shorter, hair out sideways.

09:20.561 --> 09:24.850
I haven't seen anyone
of that description.

09:24.940 --> 09:26.441
Are you, uh, quite sure?

09:26.525 --> 09:28.015
Mm-hmm.

09:28.819 --> 09:30.025
What's in there?

09:30.112 --> 09:31.477
Services.

09:31.572 --> 09:35.360
Expensive services.

09:35.451 --> 09:40.616
Well, I don't mind
expensive services.

09:42.416 --> 09:44.657
As long as they're worth
paying for.

09:56.263 --> 09:59.050
(rumbling)

09:59.141 --> 10:00.551
Do you hear that?
-Certainly do.

10:00.642 --> 10:03.054
Unusual sonic pattern.
-Double-winged.

10:03.145 --> 10:05.181
Sounds like a Stryker.
-I agree.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.012
Fastest ship in the
Scarran fleet.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.189
But what the frell is
it doing here?

10:10.277 --> 10:13.314
And Grayza seems to
recognize it, too.

10:15.824 --> 10:17.030
(whispering ):
...information.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.357
Yes.

10:18.452 --> 10:20.784
What are you gonna do now?

10:20.871 --> 10:23.658
Nebari nu anits.

10:23.749 --> 10:25.364
What's that?

10:28.670 --> 10:31.537
We begin the manipulation here.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.338
Ooh...

10:33.425 --> 10:36.292
You carry a lot of tension
in your skrillum.

10:36.386 --> 10:39.253
Oh, yeah. Tell me about it.

10:39.348 --> 10:40.212
Ooh...

10:40.307 --> 10:41.888
How does this feel?

10:41.975 --> 10:44.387
Yeah, yeah, dig deeper.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.343
Deeper, yeah.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.769
How's this?

10:51.860 --> 10:53.851
That s drad.

10:53.946 --> 10:56.403
Hey, uh, the reason why I'm...

10:56.490 --> 11:03.202
I'm really tense is because
I've been following these...
these two Sebacean males

11:03.288 --> 11:05.779
and I, uh, lthink they
came in here.

11:05.874 --> 11:09.241
And H was wondering if you
could help me out.

11:15.217 --> 11:16.548
(groaning)

11:18.428 --> 11:20.214
(grunts)

11:21.223 --> 11:24.010
I can't move.

11:24.101 --> 11:27.309
Well, pinch of pressure on
the milla-nerve

11:27.396 --> 11:30.604
paralyzes Nebari from
the neck down.

11:30.691 --> 11:32.352
Permanently?

11:32.442 --> 11:33.693
That depends.

11:33.777 --> 11:37.361
Look... I'm just a
runaway Nebari.

11:37.447 --> 11:40.575
A crook, just like
everybody else.

11:40.659 --> 11:43.321
Just... ask... ask Rekka.

11:43.412 --> 11:44.367
Re kka?

11:44.454 --> 11:46.831
Ah, frell.

11:46.915 --> 11:49.531
You know, I-l-I forgot to tell
him something, and...

11:49.626 --> 11:53.665
and it would be really great
if you could help me out.

11:53.755 --> 11:58.169
You have any idea what
else we sell here?

11:58.260 --> 12:01.252
Yeah. Genetic modification.

12:02.973 --> 12:04.213
Shape changes.

12:04.308 --> 12:05.969
That's right.

12:06.059 --> 12:12.476
And whoever buys a
transformation kit also
buys confidentiality.

12:12.566 --> 12:16.229
So he's probably just walked
straight by me.

12:31.335 --> 12:32.620
Gizahl

12:32.711 --> 12:34.326
A Scarran.

12:38.425 --> 12:41.633
Nah-ka set-at koth
sekan devock!

12:47.142 --> 12:48.473
Di-fan vivock!

12:48.560 --> 12:51.723
Scarran delegation. One's a
member of the Ruling Caste.

12:51.813 --> 12:52.973
Four Charrid escorts.

12:53.065 --> 12:55.101
One commander, one adjutant,
four warriors.

12:55.192 --> 12:57.103
Same as the other side.
-Which implies a meeting.

12:57.194 --> 12:59.901
Why? Why would she meet
with them?
-Grayza clearly isn't interested in us.

12:59.988 --> 13:01.853
So if we go and get
the modulator,

13:01.949 --> 13:04.235
this provides a perfect
opportunity for us to leave...

13:04.326 --> 13:07.864
No, no, no, no, no.
This is a perfect opportunity
for us to stay.

13:07.955 --> 13:09.911
Otherwise, we learn nothing.

13:09.998 --> 13:12.375
Does this look like an official
conference to you?

13:12.459 --> 13:15.542
On a remote planet with no
Scarran proconsul? No.

13:15.629 --> 13:20.293
Exactly. She's most likely
exceeding her authority.

13:20.384 --> 13:23.217
If we could somehow make
Peacekeeper High Command
privy to that....

13:23.303 --> 13:24.804
They will relieve her
of her duty.

13:24.888 --> 13:26.844
We get her off our backs.

13:28.225 --> 13:30.181
There's an awful lot of
"if's," Aeryn.

13:30.268 --> 13:34.307
Have we been in a more
fortuitous position
to try than now?

13:37.609 --> 13:40.567
How could I possibly serve you?

13:40.654 --> 13:43.612
I'm looking for a Nebari girl.
This high, kind of grey...

13:43.699 --> 13:45.235
Marella!

13:46.702 --> 13:48.658
Marella:
Another one?

13:48.745 --> 13:50.906
Noranti:
Ah, there she is. Psst!

13:50.998 --> 13:55.162
We have to go find the Pod now
and go to the modulator,

13:55.252 --> 13:56.867
because there are visitors here
that we'd rather not run into.

13:56.962 --> 13:58.543
Are you frelled?
-We're all frelled.

13:58.630 --> 14:02.043
Grayza and Braca are here
with four SSD commandos.

14:02.134 --> 14:03.715
Grayza and Braca?

14:03.802 --> 14:05.167
Oh, you've seen them, too.

14:05.262 --> 14:07.127
Chiana:
No, no, no. Aeryn?

14:07.222 --> 14:08.337
( static )

14:08.432 --> 14:09.296
Can you hear me?

14:09.391 --> 14:11.677
Oh, no, no, no, no. She can't.

14:11.768 --> 14:14.350
What's with the Comms?
They re pranged.

14:14.438 --> 14:16.019
Peacekeepers. Jamming.

14:16.106 --> 14:17.221
Oh come on, we've gotta go.

14:17.315 --> 14:18.691
Peacekeepers.

14:21.403 --> 14:23.234
Commando:
A Nebari female...

14:23.321 --> 14:24.356
Commandos.

14:24.448 --> 14:26.404
...report immediately
to a Peacekeeper.

14:32.330 --> 14:33.456
Transform us.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.121
Full genetic modification.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.790
Good enough to, uh,
to pass DNA scan.

14:37.878 --> 14:43.214
But you have to select a
species before we can...

14:43.300 --> 14:45.837
Well, we're not really
that choosy.
-No, no, not, not, not...

14:45.927 --> 14:47.542
Maybe... maybe big Ioomas.

14:47.637 --> 14:48.843
Noranti:
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

14:48.930 --> 14:50.511
Eyes? Eyes would be great.
-Oh, eyes!

14:50.599 --> 14:52.339
Oh, you choose.
-Yes, you choose.

14:52.434 --> 14:53.719
Nothing too special.

14:53.810 --> 14:57.723
Well, I'll do this one,
you service her.

14:57.814 --> 14:59.395
Come on.

15:02.152 --> 15:03.187
( sniffing )

15:03.278 --> 15:06.236
Braca:
The site is secure.

15:08.408 --> 15:12.993
You won't mind if we confirm
that for ourselves?

15:13.080 --> 15:15.196
If you feel it necessary.

15:15.290 --> 15:18.282
My troops are continuing
to patrol the area.

15:18.376 --> 15:20.287
How reassuring.

15:23.173 --> 15:24.288
( sniffs )

15:30.430 --> 15:32.466
Aeryn:
We're too far away.

15:33.892 --> 15:36.679
Sikozu:
This magnifies sound
as well as image.

15:36.770 --> 15:38.476
Tell me what's happening,
or I'll take over.

15:38.563 --> 15:41.100
Commandant Grayza.

15:41.191 --> 15:43.182
Minister Ahkna.

15:45.070 --> 15:49.780
That is War Minister Ahkna.
Third in rank in the
Scarran fleet.

15:49.866 --> 15:51.072
Wow.

15:51.159 --> 15:54.367
You've abided by the terms
of this meeting?

15:54.454 --> 15:56.911
Exactly as we agreed.

15:59.918 --> 16:02.330
You'll have to take
my word for it.

16:02.420 --> 16:06.663
You've been conditioned to
resist Scarran mind probing.

16:06.758 --> 16:08.259
We all have.

16:08.343 --> 16:09.173
Oh, my...

16:09.261 --> 16:11.092
What?
-Shh.

16:11.179 --> 16:15.969
Will you take my word on that,
or will you waste more time
testing us?

16:16.059 --> 16:18.641
I dislike wasting time.

16:18.728 --> 16:20.184
Why are you here?

16:20.272 --> 16:22.103
As I communicated.

16:22.190 --> 16:23.805
I want peace.

16:23.900 --> 16:26.016
Everyone wants peace.

16:26.111 --> 16:29.569
But what price will you
pay to achieve it?

16:29.656 --> 16:33.194
What if I were to offer you...

16:33.285 --> 16:36.277
the Luxan territories?

16:41.251 --> 16:42.081
Frell.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.831
Will you tell me?

16:44.921 --> 16:49.506
Grayza says she's willing to
cede all the Luxan worlds
to the Scarrans

16:49.593 --> 16:51.504
in exchange for peace.

16:51.595 --> 16:53.210
What?

16:53.305 --> 16:55.387
She can't mean it.

16:55.473 --> 16:58.180
The Peacekeepers and Luxans
have a mutual defense pact.

16:58.268 --> 17:00.475
Grayza has to be bluffing.
She can't fulfill that promise.

17:00.562 --> 17:02.268
The Luxans would go to war.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.687
And how long could the Luxans
hold out against the Scarrans

17:04.774 --> 17:08.107
without the support of
the Peacekeepers?

17:08.195 --> 17:11.278
If that really is Grayza's
intention we can't let her
go through with it.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.197
I doubt we could talk
her out of it, Aeryn.

17:14.284 --> 17:16.320
I wasn't thinking about talking.

17:17.245 --> 17:19.110
I have a gun.

17:21.750 --> 17:23.866
You would assassinate Grayza?

17:23.960 --> 17:26.451
She'd do the same to us.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.253
All right. Then what?
Do you have any plan of escape?

17:29.341 --> 17:30.205
Run.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.506
Anything more detailed, Aeryn?

17:31.593 --> 17:33.129
Run quickly.

17:33.220 --> 17:37.304
And what if we run into more
opposition than we can handle?

17:37.390 --> 17:43.260
You have the conversation with
D'Argo about why his worlds
were obliterated.

17:43.355 --> 17:47.189
Grayza:
In return for dominion over
the Luxan territories,

17:47.275 --> 17:53.646
the Scarrans will relinquish all
claims to the disputed sectors
of the Uncharted Territories.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.856
Disputed sectors being...

17:55.951 --> 17:58.613
Everywhere beyond the
Kellek Nebula.

17:58.703 --> 18:01.240
Hardly an equitable exchange.

18:01.331 --> 18:03.367
More than equitable.

18:03.458 --> 18:05.414
The Luxan worlds are wealthy.

18:05.502 --> 18:08.335
There's little of value in the
Uncharted Territories.

18:08.421 --> 18:11.504
So, why would you make
such an exchange?

18:11.591 --> 18:13.252
Especially now.

18:13.343 --> 18:15.254
The Luxans are your allies.

18:15.345 --> 18:18.007
High Command already
regrets that decision.

18:18.098 --> 18:21.636
Luxans are warriors,
not diplomats.

18:21.726 --> 18:25.935
They are a liability to
our peace efforts.

18:27.274 --> 18:31.017
So... you would just
abandon them?

18:31.403 --> 18:33.018
Yes.

18:33.113 --> 18:35.729
For the greater good.

18:35.824 --> 18:40.113
We are also aware of how
long you have coveted
their resources.

18:40.203 --> 18:43.491
In the same way you've coveted
the expansion room

18:43.581 --> 18:45.788
the Uncharted Territories
would give you.

18:45.875 --> 18:52.542
Each party gains advantages and
a costly war is averted.

18:52.632 --> 18:57.547
You would never get your Council
to support such a treaty.

18:57.637 --> 19:02.006
A majority of the counselors
already support me.

19:03.101 --> 19:06.138
They are ready for a
change of leadership.

19:06.229 --> 19:09.187
You... would seize power?

19:09.274 --> 19:12.061
For the greater good.

19:12.152 --> 19:15.736
The beneficial effects of this
treaty will also, of course,

19:15.822 --> 19:19.735
speed your ascent through
the Scarran Hierarchy.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.283
I need no help in that regard.

19:22.370 --> 19:24.031
Ah.

19:25.290 --> 19:28.782
How many cycles ago was
your father deposed?

19:31.046 --> 19:34.789
How long since your
last promotion?

19:36.217 --> 19:38.299
Toolong.

19:38.386 --> 19:43.847
But then, I don't resort to the
methods you utilize to advance.

19:43.933 --> 19:50.475
Would you have a weapon in your
armory and leave it unused,

19:50.565 --> 19:53.227
out of squeamish good taste?

19:53.318 --> 19:54.899
Commando:
Captain Braca.

19:54.986 --> 19:57.568
It's all right. Yes?

19:57.655 --> 20:01.113
We have word of a Nebari female
somewhere in the settlement.

20:01.201 --> 20:03.567
Description matches the
escapee Chiana.

20:03.661 --> 20:05.322
Braca:
Stay here.

20:05.413 --> 20:07.278
I'll check it out.

20:10.835 --> 20:12.245
You. Nebari female.

20:12.337 --> 20:14.623
You look fine.
-I look hideous.

20:14.714 --> 20:17.251
No wisdom creases,
no memory lines.

20:17.634 --> 20:19.670
My eye!
-Whoa.

20:19.761 --> 20:21.251
Noranti:
Look, I've earned all these
things and l...

20:21.346 --> 20:23.803
Shut your wacket hole. Let me
do the talking, okay? Okay.

20:23.890 --> 20:27.178
We're looking for a
female Nebari.

20:28.186 --> 20:29.392
You.

20:31.439 --> 20:33.816
You.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.812
We're looking for a
Nebari. Female.

20:39.072 --> 20:41.108
( in a deep sultry voice)
Well, then try Sooret's.

20:41.199 --> 20:42.564
Level three.

20:42.659 --> 20:47.904
Any kind of... of female
you could care for.

20:47.997 --> 20:48.827
Right.

20:48.915 --> 20:51.327
Hands off.

20:51.418 --> 20:53.249
I'm not on the market.

20:53.336 --> 20:57.204
Besides, I don't even like men.

20:58.716 --> 21:01.253
What are you doing?
-DNA scan.

21:02.679 --> 21:04.795
(Chiana grunts)
-Be quiet.

21:04.889 --> 21:08.052
Oh, quiet? Quiet, my eema.
-No match.

21:08.143 --> 21:10.225
Just because you've got
a fancy uniform...
-O|d woman.

21:10.311 --> 21:13.974
...does that make
you important?
-Ooh. What is that?

21:14.065 --> 21:15.521
What is that?
-Drugs?

21:15.608 --> 21:18.350
Ooh! I don't need drugs.
I've got true love.

21:18.445 --> 21:20.652
You don't need drugs if
you've got true love.

21:20.738 --> 21:22.729
You. Have you seen
a Nebari female?

21:22.824 --> 21:25.941
Well, I wouldn't know one
if it bit me on the prang.

21:26.035 --> 21:27.366
Though that could be fun.

21:27.454 --> 21:29.445
Gray girl. Thin. Young.

21:29.539 --> 21:31.746
Good looking?
-Mmm.

21:31.833 --> 21:35.200
We only ever notice the
good looking ones.

21:39.257 --> 21:42.749
I said I would do the talking.

21:42.844 --> 21:45.381
Well, you didn't say
all the talking.

21:49.225 --> 21:51.716
I thought we did rather well.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.551
(gasping )
Come on.

21:53.646 --> 21:56.228
We've gotta get back to Aeryn
before the treatment wears off.

21:56.316 --> 21:59.979
Sikozu:
They're still arguing about
how to carve up the Uncharted Territories.

22:00.069 --> 22:02.606
But you still believe that Ahkna
wants the deal to go ahead?

22:02.697 --> 22:04.198
Yes, I do.

22:04.282 --> 22:08.195
Grayza:
So you would approve a division
point at the Lanthal system.

22:08.286 --> 22:11.198
Ahkna:
In principle, yes.

22:11.289 --> 22:13.075
Then it would seem we
have an agreement.

22:13.166 --> 22:16.454
Ahkna:
First, let's talk
about disarmament.

22:16.544 --> 22:18.921
I'm not prepared to
discuss that.

22:19.005 --> 22:22.168
At present, I'll deal only with
territory, not weapons.

22:22.258 --> 22:23.668
Unsatisfactory.

22:23.760 --> 22:26.217
You claim you have military
superiority.

22:26.304 --> 22:28.044
We do more than claim!

22:28.139 --> 22:30.471
Yet you will not even talk
about arms reduction.

22:30.558 --> 22:35.222
We are prepared to coexist in
peace, but not to make
ourselves vulnerable.

22:35.313 --> 22:40.273
There are some in our
hierarchy who believe you
are already vulnerable.

22:40.360 --> 22:45.775
That your claims to military
superiority are exaggerated.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.777
Perhaps the loss of our
Dreadnought was only
an experiment,

22:48.868 --> 22:52.110
that you haven't been
able to repeat or,

22:52.205 --> 22:55.789
perhaps it wasn't you
who did it.

22:55.875 --> 23:00.335
If this is so, why should
we settle for peace?

23:00.421 --> 23:03.834
Because you would lose a war.

23:06.427 --> 23:09.009
Ahkna's suspicious.

23:09.097 --> 23:14.057
She thinks the Peacekeepers
might be lying about having
wormhole weapons.

23:14.143 --> 23:16.759
The fear of wormhole weapons
is the only thing
stopping Scarrans

23:16.854 --> 23:18.594
from invading
Peacekeeperspace.

23:18.690 --> 23:22.399
Without them thinking
they've got those weapons
everyone's frelled.

23:23.194 --> 23:24.809
(sighs)

23:29.284 --> 23:33.493
Grayza is making out a document.
Ahkna is looking it over.

23:33.580 --> 23:35.195
Okay.

23:35.915 --> 23:38.076
It's time to intervene.

23:39.919 --> 23:40.999
Commando:
Maintain intruder alert.

23:41.087 --> 23:43.453
Wait.
-Full search pattern.

23:52.307 --> 23:54.138
The treaty appears
satisfactory.

23:54.225 --> 23:55.385
It is.

23:55.476 --> 23:57.387
Your captain should
bear witness.

23:57.478 --> 24:01.596
There is no need to wait for
him, if you're ready.

24:01.691 --> 24:04.228
Pennoch. Bear witness.

24:10.366 --> 24:11.355
(grunting)

24:11.451 --> 24:13.191
(gasping)

24:14.787 --> 24:15.902
( snapping )

24:22.378 --> 24:23.333
( short beep )

24:23.421 --> 24:25.252
( short beep )

24:25.340 --> 24:27.171
(weapon charging )

24:27.258 --> 24:28.873
It's too late.
They've already signed.

24:28.968 --> 24:33.007
Kill her anyway. They will never
enforce a treaty if she's dead.

24:33.097 --> 24:35.383
I can't get a shot.

24:36.434 --> 24:38.675
There was no Nebari, ma'am.

24:38.770 --> 24:40.852
No matter, Captain Braca.

24:41.731 --> 24:45.770
This... was an historic day.

24:46.402 --> 24:47.312
Congratulations.

24:47.403 --> 24:48.233
Pennoch.

24:48.321 --> 24:49.902
( growls )

24:50.531 --> 24:52.067
(gunfire)

24:56.371 --> 24:58.327
(gasping )

25:05.338 --> 25:07.545
Ahkna, you are a fool.

25:07.632 --> 25:09.418
This is an act of war.

25:09.509 --> 25:13.218
I assure you, Commandant,
you won't be missed.

25:13.304 --> 25:15.636
Grayza:
You would not dare murder me.

25:15.723 --> 25:22.310
We merely want to speak in much
more detailed terms about your
wormhole capabilities.

25:22.397 --> 25:25.355
You already know that
you'll learn nothing.

25:25.900 --> 25:27.436
No, not here.

25:27.527 --> 25:31.645
But our facilities are so much
better on Katratzi.

25:33.825 --> 25:35.486
( Pennoch snarls)

25:39.372 --> 25:41.328
They'll interrogate her now.

25:41.416 --> 25:46.035
What happens when they learn the
truth about wormhole weapons?

25:46.629 --> 25:48.085
They won't.

25:48.172 --> 25:50.128
We can't let them.

26:02.270 --> 26:03.885
Sikozu?
-Shh.

26:05.273 --> 26:06.638
Frell.

26:22.373 --> 26:23.488
Go.

26:25.251 --> 26:27.242
What the frell happened
to you two?

26:27.336 --> 26:29.327
We needed a camouflage to
fool the DNA scans.
-It isn't permanent.

26:29.422 --> 26:31.378
Have you got the modulator?
-Not yet.

26:31.466 --> 26:33.297
What are Scarrans doing here?
-Doesn't matter.

26:35.845 --> 26:36.960
Right.

26:37.054 --> 26:37.964
Go.

26:38.055 --> 26:39.215
Right, we're low on weapons.

26:39.307 --> 26:41.343
Well, I didn't bring any guns.
I don't have any guns.

26:41.434 --> 26:42.970
What can you do?
What can you make?

26:43.060 --> 26:44.641
Fyang powder.
It's a wonderful substance.

26:44.729 --> 26:46.890
It'll put anyone to
sleep instantly.
-Good.

26:46.981 --> 26:48.482
Except I don't have any.
-Not good.

26:48.566 --> 26:51.854
However, this looks like mayla
spores. They're very powerful.

26:51.944 --> 26:54.196
Scarrans, Charrids.
Will it work on them?

26:54.280 --> 26:56.362
I've never tried on either.

26:57.533 --> 27:00.320
Ahkna, this blunder will
cost you dearly.

27:00.411 --> 27:04.871
Hmm. The blunder was
yours, Commandant.

27:04.957 --> 27:07.664
Braca:
You've just guaranteed
yourselves a war you cannot win.

27:07.752 --> 27:10.835
Our wormhole technology will
decimate your planet.

27:10.922 --> 27:12.207
(gasping)

27:12.298 --> 27:14.459
Pennoch:
You terrify me.

27:16.260 --> 27:19.127
Do we need this one?

27:19.222 --> 27:21.213
Yes, we do.

27:21.307 --> 27:26.222
When he no longer has a use,
may I be the one to
dispose of him?

27:26.312 --> 27:28.098
Yes, you may.

27:28.189 --> 27:31.306
Let us prepare the Stryker and
summon the Dreadnought to
the rendezvous point.

27:31.400 --> 27:33.265
We won't be long.

27:34.654 --> 27:36.394
(grunting)

27:38.950 --> 27:40.065
How are you going, Noranti?

27:40.159 --> 27:41.820
Preparing mayla spores
takes time.

27:41.911 --> 27:43.492
( spits )
And spit.

27:43.579 --> 27:45.535
We never have enough time.

27:45.623 --> 27:47.238
I don't have enough spit.

27:47.333 --> 27:49.039
But I'm doing what I can.

27:50.336 --> 27:53.453
All right. They took Grayza
and Braca into Bay Nine

27:53.548 --> 27:55.129
but their Stryker's still
powered down.

27:55.216 --> 27:57.423
So, we have enough time to...
-No. Two Charrids
came back out.

27:57.510 --> 27:59.091
They're heading this way now.
-Two?

27:59.178 --> 28:00.918
Charrid:
You heard Ahkna's orders.

28:01.013 --> 28:03.800
If you see a Peacekeeper
Commando shoot to kill.

28:15.987 --> 28:18.820
Identify yourself.
-Don't shoot.

28:18.906 --> 28:20.191
I know who you are.

28:20.283 --> 28:21.443
(whispering ):
What are you doing?

28:21.534 --> 28:24.150
And I know who you're
looking for.

28:24.245 --> 28:26.236
You don't have to harm me.

28:26.330 --> 28:28.707
I can show you where to find
the ones you're seeking.

28:28.791 --> 28:29.951
Tell me where they are.

28:30.042 --> 28:32.579
Just a microt. My nose. I...

28:32.670 --> 28:33.910
I... need...

28:34.005 --> 28:34.994
I need a...

28:35.089 --> 28:36.204
( sneezes )

28:36.299 --> 28:39.257
Aah!
-Just a sneeze. I'm sorry.

28:39.343 --> 28:46.181
I said I could help to find
the ones you seek,
and I will show you.

28:46.267 --> 28:48.223
Right now, there's one
behind you.

28:48.311 --> 28:49.892
Right there. A Peacekeeper.

28:49.979 --> 28:51.685
(grunts)

28:51.772 --> 28:53.637
(grunts)

28:55.526 --> 28:57.187
(grunts)

28:58.279 --> 28:59.815
(gasps )

29:01.574 --> 29:03.155
( sizzling )

29:03.242 --> 29:07.235
Yeah. I must remember to get
more mayla spores.

29:07.330 --> 29:09.867
Yes. That was good. Thank you.

29:11.417 --> 29:14.409
Now, I know it's not your
color, but...

29:16.297 --> 29:18.663
Sikozu:
It'll get us into Bay Nine.

29:20.384 --> 29:22.124
Noranti:
Oh, please, let me go.

29:22.219 --> 29:23.379
I'm not a Peacekeeper.

29:23.471 --> 29:25.052
I don't even know
any Peacekeepers.

29:25.139 --> 29:27.255
You've got the wrong
young female.

29:27.350 --> 29:29.215
(panting)

29:30.019 --> 29:31.805
Oh, please, please.

29:31.896 --> 29:33.261
I'm being attacked by one...

29:33.356 --> 29:35.017
by two... of you.

29:35.107 --> 29:36.563
Aeryn:
Hey, gorgeous.

29:36.651 --> 29:38.391
(grunting)

29:41.405 --> 29:42.861
Hello.

29:42.949 --> 29:45.861
Sikozu:
That leaves us one Charrid,
two Scarrans...

29:45.952 --> 29:48.785
Aeryn:
And two Peacekeepers,
Commandant.

30:00.424 --> 30:01.379
(engines powering up)

30:01.467 --> 30:03.082
Frell.

30:05.137 --> 30:06.468
( groans )

30:12.228 --> 30:14.139
Grayza:
Aeryn Sun.

30:14.230 --> 30:16.095
Exceptional work.

30:16.190 --> 30:18.556
And congratulations on
your Luxan treaty.

30:18.651 --> 30:20.642
For that alone I shall
kill you both.

30:20.736 --> 30:21.942
Aeryn...

30:22.029 --> 30:25.442
Grayza:
Alive, I can repudiate
that treaty.

30:25.533 --> 30:27.945
But you proposed it,
and you signed it.

30:28.035 --> 30:31.948
And if the Scarrans had
not betrayed me, I'd
have stood by it.

30:32.039 --> 30:34.621
We could have lived in peace.

30:34.709 --> 30:38.873
Without me, how are you
planning to get past the
Command Carrier

30:38.963 --> 30:41.921
that's orbiting this
dead Leviathan?

30:48.848 --> 30:51.339
If I'm not back at the Pod in
half an am, you go without me.

30:51.434 --> 30:52.549
What?!
-Go.

30:52.643 --> 30:54.508
I'll cover.
-Move.

30:57.857 --> 30:59.222
(grunts)

31:04.280 --> 31:07.317
(growling)

31:07.408 --> 31:09.273
Sikozu:
Into... into the cafe.
Into the cafe!

31:09.368 --> 31:10.653
No. The Pod is that way.

31:10.745 --> 31:12.576
No, Noranti, we're going
to wait here for Aeryn.

31:12.663 --> 31:15.496
Aeryn is dead by now.
-I said keep moving...

31:15.583 --> 31:16.948
-She's right.
...to the back.

31:17.043 --> 31:19.329
Killing Charrids is one thing,
but two Scarrans?

31:19.420 --> 31:21.206
I said, shut up!

31:21.297 --> 31:24.209
It was a great sacrifice
on her part.

31:24.300 --> 31:26.131
It isn't over.
She will survive.

31:26.218 --> 31:27.833
Alone? She's got no chance.

31:27.928 --> 31:30.055
Maybe you should go and
help her and I'll take
these two to the Pod.

31:30.139 --> 31:31.845
No, Noranti.
We have one weapon.

31:31.932 --> 31:33.547
The Scarrans will be
here any microt.

31:33.642 --> 31:35.018
This area is undefendable.

31:35.102 --> 31:36.603
Might I suggest...
-Shut up!

31:36.687 --> 31:39.144
If we stay, we die.

31:39.231 --> 31:42.268
It would be a great pity if
Aeryn's death were for nothing.

31:42.359 --> 31:43.690
She's not dead.

31:43.778 --> 31:45.143
(grunting)

31:47.239 --> 31:50.697
This way.
-Find the Marauder.
We must leave immediately.

31:52.661 --> 31:54.197
Why did you do that?

31:54.288 --> 31:57.200
We don't like trespassers.

31:57.291 --> 31:59.498
This is my Pod, okay?

31:59.585 --> 32:01.871
I got transformed.

32:01.962 --> 32:03.213
Look.

32:03.297 --> 32:05.003
Look at me. It's me.

32:05.091 --> 32:07.082
( laughing )

32:08.385 --> 32:11.798
Uh, seriously now, we do
have a strict policy.

32:11.889 --> 32:14.676
Nobody steals our
client's ships.

32:14.767 --> 32:16.974
( startled gasps )

32:22.274 --> 32:24.765
Noranti. Noranti.

32:25.611 --> 32:27.226
You right?

32:27.321 --> 32:29.607
Up you get.
( grunts )

32:29.698 --> 32:36.661
I swear to you, I've been
genetically transformed to
fool the Peacekeepers.

32:36.747 --> 32:39.284
You gave me the
frelling tokens.

32:46.590 --> 32:47.796
It's her.

32:47.883 --> 32:49.384
Are you sure?

32:49.468 --> 32:52.210
They didn't transform
her tongue.

32:53.055 --> 32:55.011
In that case,

32:55.099 --> 33:00.560
here's your modulator, with the
sensor distorter installed.

33:00.646 --> 33:03.558
You do still want this?

33:03.649 --> 33:06.140
Plug it into the Nee-la trunk.

33:06.235 --> 33:08.977
Your Pilot will feel
his options.

33:10.447 --> 33:12.028
Hey.

33:12.116 --> 33:13.981
Do I get a discount for
being knocked out?

33:14.076 --> 33:16.442
( laughs )

33:16.537 --> 33:18.698
We should charge you more
for guarding your Pod.

33:18.789 --> 33:20.825
( snarling )
-What's going on?

33:22.168 --> 33:24.284
Thanks for your patronage.

33:26.213 --> 33:27.123
Are you all right?

33:27.214 --> 33:29.000
Yeah.

33:29.091 --> 33:30.331
Let's get this Pod started.

33:30.426 --> 33:31.757
Shouldn't we wait for Aeryn?

33:31.844 --> 33:34.210
We'll wait half an em,
like she said.

33:34.305 --> 33:35.215
So where is she?

33:35.306 --> 33:36.671
You all right?

33:36.765 --> 33:39.097
Where are the Scarrans?
What if they get here first?

33:39.185 --> 33:44.270
If the Scarrans get here first,
then we leave immediately.

33:44.356 --> 33:47.018
Because Aeryn is as
good as dead.

33:55.159 --> 33:56.274
It's almost time.

33:56.368 --> 33:58.199
No. We need to find Aeryn.

33:58.287 --> 33:59.993
Wait, Chiana, please.

34:00.080 --> 34:02.457
For once in your life,
exercise some self-control.

34:02.541 --> 34:05.203
I am exercising self-control.
I'm not blasting off your head.

34:05.294 --> 34:06.750
Stop, stop. She's coming.

34:06.837 --> 34:08.168
Oh, thankjung.
-Are you all right?

34:08.255 --> 34:10.166
Yes, I'm fine.

34:10.257 --> 34:12.418
All right.
Sit down and hold on.

34:19.892 --> 34:22.133
Pilot, any word?
-Yes, Ka D'Argo.

34:22.228 --> 34:25.345
As you speak, a Transport Pod
is approaching at high speed.

34:25.439 --> 34:27.771
Have they signaled distress?
-No.

34:27.858 --> 34:30.065
Have we signaled
Rygel's distress?

34:30.152 --> 34:34.771
Inadvisable, as that would
confirm our position to the
Scarran warship pursuing them.

34:34.865 --> 34:37.026
Pilot, Starburst as soon
as they're aboard.

34:37.117 --> 34:39.654
I am already preparing,
Captain.

34:49.255 --> 34:51.337
Stand by for Starburst.

34:51.423 --> 34:52.333
Now.

35:04.395 --> 35:06.306
( sniffing )

35:09.400 --> 35:11.561
Do you really need to do that?

35:11.652 --> 35:14.314
Remarkable.

35:14.405 --> 35:18.148
Well, changing my genetics
changes my scent.

35:18.242 --> 35:19.778
Is it permanent?

35:19.868 --> 35:22.075
Do you want it to be?

35:25.374 --> 35:28.286
I prefer the elegant gray.

35:29.253 --> 35:31.335
Rygel:
You paid too much.

35:31.422 --> 35:35.335
Ah. You don't even know
if I paid.

35:35.426 --> 35:39.544
It was still too much.
I'll reimburse you double
if you can cook for me.

35:39.638 --> 35:41.139
I may never cook again.

35:41.223 --> 35:43.259
Noranti, please!

35:43.350 --> 35:45.181
Crichton:
It's not your fault.

35:45.269 --> 35:46.634
We had her. We let her go.

35:46.729 --> 35:49.220
Well, you're here, she's not.
I'll take that trade.

35:49.315 --> 35:51.897
She tried to strike a deal.
Ahkna wouldn't go for it.

35:51.984 --> 35:54.817
The Scarrans must be
dead set on war.

35:54.903 --> 35:56.609
That s Scorpy 8 line.

35:56.697 --> 36:00.110
Let someone else lose sleep
over it tonight.

36:00.200 --> 36:02.191
What should we lose sleep over?

36:04.413 --> 36:06.119
Careful.

36:08.375 --> 36:10.036
(roaring jolt)

36:16.925 --> 36:21.419
Everyone, despite our
Starburst, the Scarran warship
is still in pursuit,

36:21.513 --> 36:24.095
at the extreme edge
of Moya's senses.

36:24.183 --> 36:25.969
How did they find us so fast?

36:26.060 --> 36:27.391
Try a homing beaon.

36:27.478 --> 36:28.388
Pilot.

36:28.479 --> 36:30.640
I'm not detecting any signals.

36:30.731 --> 36:33.473
John's right. Must be
a beacon. Chiana.

36:33.567 --> 36:36.559
Nope, nothing in the Pod.
Still looking.

36:36.653 --> 36:42.649
I am certain the sensor
distorter contains no
transmitter or homing beacon, of any sort.

36:42.743 --> 36:46.452
All right, it's not
the hardware. Try the
software. Pilot?

36:46.538 --> 36:48.074
Adjusting now.

36:48.165 --> 36:51.453
Anything from that planet.
Anything.

36:51.543 --> 36:54.580
You know, it could be her.
We were separated.

36:56.423 --> 36:59.210
I did not betray you.

37:08.435 --> 37:09.811
What?

37:09.895 --> 37:11.260
You want me to undress?

37:11.355 --> 37:15.189
The DRDs detect nothing
from either Sikozu,
Chiana or Noranti.

37:15.275 --> 37:17.937
Nothing from Aeryn either.

37:18.028 --> 37:22.567
Scorpius:
A tier-by-tier search of
this vessel would be the unavoidable next step.

37:22.658 --> 37:24.774
Pilot:
There's no time for that.

37:24.868 --> 37:29.111
The Scarran warship is now
on the on the edge of
Moya's sense horizon.

37:39.341 --> 37:41.878
Have they found us again?

37:41.969 --> 37:43.254
Frell me.

37:43.345 --> 37:44.551
Soon enough.

37:44.638 --> 37:46.048
Can Moya Starburst?

37:46.140 --> 37:47.505
Not for some time.

37:47.599 --> 37:49.305
Activate the sensor distorter.

37:49.393 --> 37:51.133
It is not ready yet.

37:51.228 --> 37:53.435
How long until the warship
identifies us?

37:53.522 --> 37:56.889
Perhaps 200 microts.

37:56.984 --> 37:59.270
I hate to say it, but...
-Then don't.

37:59.361 --> 38:01.693
Noranti:
No one is chasing
Moya and Pilot.

38:01.780 --> 38:04.237
It might be better
just to leave them.

38:04.324 --> 38:06.406
Are we gonna do this? Bail?

38:07.703 --> 38:09.785
Safest for Moya.

38:10.873 --> 38:12.659
And what about the...

38:14.209 --> 38:16.325
Baby? What about the baby?

38:17.504 --> 38:19.119
What?

38:32.186 --> 38:34.928
Where's the beacon, Aeryn?

38:37.191 --> 38:38.931
We don't know.

38:39.985 --> 38:41.065
Where's the beacon, Aeryn?

38:41.153 --> 38:42.984
We don't know.
-Crichton, what...

38:43.071 --> 38:44.106
Wait!

38:45.115 --> 38:46.855
Crichton:
Where's the beacon?

38:46.950 --> 38:48.736
Chiana:
Crichton, what are you doing?

38:48.827 --> 38:50.692
Where's the beacon?
It's a simple question.

38:50.787 --> 38:51.867
Where's the beacon?

38:51.955 --> 38:53.536
We don't know where
the beacon is.

38:53.624 --> 38:55.080
Crichton, what are you doing?

38:55.167 --> 38:56.782
Crichton:
Where's the beacon?
Where's the baby?

38:56.877 --> 38:58.868
Where's the baby?
Where's the beacon?

38:58.962 --> 39:01.339
Beacon,baby,beacon,baby.

39:03.217 --> 39:04.502
Whose beacon?

39:04.593 --> 39:06.129
Whose baby?

39:06.220 --> 39:07.630
Who's the beacon?

39:07.721 --> 39:09.086
Who's the baby?

39:09.181 --> 39:10.796
Whose baby is it?
Who's the daddy, Aeryn?

39:10.891 --> 39:14.008
Aeryn, who's the daddy? D'Argo,
tell her who the daddy is.

39:15.229 --> 39:17.311
We don't know who the daddy is.

39:17.397 --> 39:19.479
Right, we don't know...

39:19.566 --> 39:21.227
who.

39:22.361 --> 39:26.070
Say "baby," Aeryn.

39:26.156 --> 39:28.112
Aeryn, say "baby."

39:30.410 --> 39:32.150
Say"baby?

39:33.789 --> 39:35.074
Spell it.

39:37.960 --> 39:40.918
A, B, C, D,

39:41.004 --> 39:44.167
E, F, G7

39:44.258 --> 39:47.421
H, |, J...

39:55.435 --> 39:58.427
Where's Aeryn, Aeryn?

40:02.651 --> 40:03.891
( electrical crackling )

40:07.197 --> 40:08.528
( hissess )

40:13.870 --> 40:15.997
A bioloid.

40:16.081 --> 40:18.288
What's a bioloid?

40:18.375 --> 40:19.740
Sikozu:
That.

40:22.379 --> 40:27.373
30 microts, everyone, until
a Scarran warship is close
enough to identify us.

40:27.467 --> 40:33.679
Pilot, l have temporarily
patched the sensor distorter
to your neural pathway.

40:33.765 --> 40:35.141
I feel it.

40:35.225 --> 40:37.602
There is a choice
of signatures.

40:37.686 --> 40:40.769
A Scarran ore freighter,
and mimic its movements.

40:40.856 --> 40:42.892
Engaging now.

40:49.197 --> 40:51.404
The Scarran warship
is signaling.

40:51.491 --> 40:53.197
Okay, let's hear it.

40:53.285 --> 40:55.992
Ko-nach! Ko-nach!

40:56.079 --> 41:00.869
Frez-ne Ko-nach!
Frez-ne Ko-nach!

41:00.959 --> 41:02.415
My mother tongue.

41:05.589 --> 41:07.250
You.

41:08.634 --> 41:11.421
Nach-ko Frey-za Kalish-ah.

41:11.511 --> 41:13.342
Scarran:
Nak-ca Leh-vi-a-than?

41:13.430 --> 41:16.638
Sikozu:
Lee! Eel-ca dir Stir-berk!

41:16.725 --> 41:23.221
Bac-du karekko o nailn
tra marden,

41:23.315 --> 41:27.024
ska brecarro, pelotin.

41:28.362 --> 41:30.353
Scarran:
Az Ko-nich.

41:36.203 --> 41:40.993
Pilot:
The warship is breaking off
and accelerating away.

41:47.506 --> 41:50.714
What did you say to them?

41:50.801 --> 41:55.591
I told them that we saw
a Leviathan Starburst
a moment ago,

41:55.681 --> 42:02.177
that we were afraid it was going
to board us, and I thanked them
for scaring it away.

42:02.270 --> 42:03.601
(grunts)

42:04.356 --> 42:06.017
( heavy sigh )

42:47.733 --> 42:52.193
That device confining Grayza
was not meant to transport her.

42:52.279 --> 42:56.613
Scorpius:
No. It replicates living flesh.

42:56.700 --> 43:03.071
We've known about it for some
time, but never encountered
the result.

43:03.165 --> 43:04.996
D'Argo:
Effective technique.

43:05.083 --> 43:08.166
No rescue attempt while
they're at their leisure
to torture Grayza.

43:08.253 --> 43:12.292
And now, her duplicate spies
on the Peacekeepers.

43:12.382 --> 43:14.839
Then why did they take Aeryn?

43:16.845 --> 43:19.302
I got away.

43:19.890 --> 43:22.097
She got caught.

43:22.184 --> 43:28.680
Noranti:
Maybe they thought this creature
would bring back Grayza.

43:29.483 --> 43:31.519
Or Crichton.

43:32.819 --> 43:34.355
Sikozu.

43:48.543 --> 43:50.659
(sighing)

43:51.963 --> 43:53.419
You okay?

43:55.217 --> 43:57.003
No.

43:58.428 --> 44:01.386
You know, it's not Aeryn.

44:02.432 --> 44:04.218
It was never Aeryn.

44:09.606 --> 44:12.643
We're not gonna give up
on her, John.

44:12.734 --> 44:17.444
Sikozu said the Scarrans
are taking Grayza to a
place called Katratzi.

44:17.531 --> 44:20.864
Maybe that's where
Aeryn is now.

44:20.951 --> 44:23.237
She could be anywhere
out there.

44:26.456 --> 44:28.617
But we're not gonna let her go.

44:30.210 --> 44:32.246
I give you my word.
