00:01.335 --> 00:03.474
Narrator:
In New York City war on crime

00:03.504 --> 00:06.883
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:06.907 --> 00:08.978
of the Major Case Squad.

00:09.009 --> 00:11.011
These are their stories.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.818
All I know is she must have gotten my name

00:14.848 --> 00:17.351
and she must have talked about me to my PO.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.727
No, I don't think he knows anything.

00:25.025 --> 00:28.666
Okay, okay, I get it.

00:28.695 --> 00:31.005
I'm gonna take care of everything for you.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.874
Just don't worry.

00:37.571 --> 00:40.984
Carver: The fillers for the lineup
were Hispanic men like the defendant,

00:41.008 --> 00:44.353
they had mustaches like the defendant,
glasses like the defendant.

00:44.378 --> 00:47.257
Man: They outweighed him
by about 50 pounds each.

00:47.281 --> 00:50.023
Carver: Only because his
client went on a crash diet

00:50.050 --> 00:52.963
after he committed his crime.
We chose fillers for the lineup

00:52.986 --> 00:55.193
who matched Mr. Villanueva's appearance

00:55.222 --> 00:58.499
at the time he held up the bodega,
which is entirely proper.

00:58.525 --> 01:00.562
It is if I say it is, Mr. Carver.

01:01.495 --> 01:03.475
I'll give you my decision tomorrow.

01:03.497 --> 01:06.808
How does this work
for my calendar, Ms. Trudeau?

01:06.833 --> 01:09.074
9:00 am, Judge.

01:10.504 --> 01:12.984
Good. 9:00 then.

01:13.006 --> 01:15.486
And if you're late, bring a toothbrush,

01:15.509 --> 01:17.682
because I will hold you in contempt.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.074

01:26.820 --> 01:28.697
Say hi to Cindy.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.036
- Bye.
- Okay.

01:56.216 --> 01:58.696
Man: I've been in the john half the night.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.665
Got to be the onion rings.

02:01.989 --> 02:03.991
Give me that flight number again?

02:11.164 --> 02:13.644
Yeah, l-- I got it.

02:13.667 --> 02:16.910
Look, if my plumbing acts up again,

02:16.937 --> 02:18.348
I'll call in.

02:22.342 --> 02:25.323
I've got a time-certain call
on Greenwald's part.

02:25.345 --> 02:27.484
Can we administratively adjourn this?

02:27.514 --> 02:30.688
Blakemore's never late. Can we wait a minute?

02:34.788 --> 02:37.325
- Is he in chambers?
- There's no answer.

02:37.357 --> 02:39.166
He's got to be on his way down.

02:39.192 --> 02:41.172
( beeping )

02:52.072 --> 02:53.676
Ron, thanks for coming.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.345
This is Jess Litton, my attorney.

02:55.375 --> 02:57.685
Ron Carver from the
District Attorney's office.

02:57.711 --> 03:00.692
I don't know if Mrs. Lewin told you,
but we also called the police.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.216
They should be here any minute.

03:02.249 --> 03:03.956
Do you want to wait for them?

03:03.984 --> 03:05.657
Uh, no. It's in here.

03:18.665 --> 03:21.976
It's Emily Trudeau. Judge Blakemore's clerk.

03:29.676 --> 03:31.815
( theme music playing )

04:23.330 --> 04:25.105
Carver: Blakemore is in his study.

04:25.132 --> 04:26.907
We can start whenever you're ready.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.241
You see something?

04:36.343 --> 04:39.051
Is his investigative style
always so sociable?

04:40.213 --> 04:42.056
Yeah, sure.

04:45.185 --> 04:47.631
The killer wrapped her head in the towel

04:47.654 --> 04:50.965
before slamming it twice
into the corner of the counter.

04:50.991 --> 04:53.835
- Minimize blood spatter?
- Maybe.

04:53.860 --> 04:56.101
But it doesn't match the other kitchen towels.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.006
Eames: He brought it with him.

04:58.031 --> 04:59.704
Yeah, and he left it behind.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.770
But he took something else with him.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.748
The trash?

05:03.770 --> 05:05.943
There's no liner bag.

05:05.972 --> 05:08.475
But there's... smell.

05:08.508 --> 05:09.953
Vomit.

05:11.144 --> 05:14.318
He threw up in there after killing her.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.465
Why she was here is unimportant.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.262
The point is, she was going home.

05:22.289 --> 05:24.895
Her diaphragm was washed. It's still wet.

05:26.259 --> 05:29.331
That's completely irrelevant
to the issue of who killed her.

05:29.362 --> 05:32.343
At this point, Judge, what's
relevant isn't your call.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.174
We do need you to be candid, Your Honor.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.513
- Were we having an affair?
- Yes.

05:41.541 --> 05:43.543
There's nothing more to it than that.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.989
- Eames: For how long-- the ahh?
- Long enough.

05:46.012 --> 05:48.492
Why don't you focus instead on who did this?

05:48.515 --> 05:49.858
Eames: We are.

05:50.851 --> 05:54.321
How often did your wife visit
your daughter out in Connecticut?

05:54.354 --> 05:56.630
Every other weekend.

05:56.656 --> 05:58.829
She always leaves on a Thursday?

05:58.859 --> 06:01.635
- Yes.
- So why wasn't Ms. Trudeau
spending the night here?

06:03.296 --> 06:05.799
Emily lives with her mother,
who has Parkinson's.

06:05.832 --> 06:08.176
She's uncomfortable leaving her
alone all night.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.942
Are we nearly finished here?

06:09.970 --> 06:11.381
Eames: No.

06:11.404 --> 06:13.213
Did your wife know about her?

06:13.240 --> 06:14.947
Absolutely not.

06:14.975 --> 06:18.252
I know what you're insinuating.
Nothing of the sort happened.

06:18.278 --> 06:20.121
There's only one explanation for this--

06:20.146 --> 06:22.319
Emily was surprised by a burglar.

06:22.349 --> 06:24.295
A burglar? Did you hear a burglar?

06:24.317 --> 06:26.627
No, I didn't hear anything.

06:26.653 --> 06:29.327
Didn't you walk her downstairs
when she was leaving?

06:29.356 --> 06:31.632
No, I was in bed, asleep.

06:31.658 --> 06:34.002
Well, that's a...

06:36.496 --> 06:38.237
Did you two have a fight?

06:38.265 --> 06:39.903
No.

06:39.933 --> 06:42.379
You let her find her own way out in the dark?

06:44.337 --> 06:48.012
You know, I find the tone of your
questions completely gratuitous.

06:48.041 --> 06:51.648
I'm done here. You deal with them.
I've got to call my wife.

06:51.678 --> 06:54.522
Just one last thing. What did
you have to eat last night?

06:57.684 --> 06:59.664
This investigation will be run by the book.

06:59.686 --> 07:01.427
I don't care whose ass needs kissing,

07:01.454 --> 07:04.765
you tell Mrs. Lewin, I'm not putting up
with any crap from the DA's office.

07:04.791 --> 07:07.101
I didn't suggest you should.

07:07.127 --> 07:09.403
But Judge Blakemore is a
well-respected jurist,

07:09.429 --> 07:12.706
contributes regularly to legal journals

07:12.732 --> 07:15.110
and is a candidate for the Appellate Court.

07:15.135 --> 07:17.741
And he was banging his law clerk.

07:19.139 --> 07:21.278
This is a press case.

07:21.308 --> 07:24.778
Good cops lose their pensions
'cause of press cases.

07:24.811 --> 07:27.451
I don't plan on losing mine
because of Judge Blakemore.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.551
I'll relay your concerns to Mrs. Lewin.

07:32.986 --> 07:35.398
Anything to this burglary theory?

07:35.422 --> 07:38.767
Eames: No forced entry, and the
only thing stolen was the trash.

07:38.792 --> 07:42.740
The killer threw up in the trash. We found
splatter on the floor. It's being analyzed.

07:42.762 --> 07:46.107
- The judge?
- Could be, but the attack was
planned and orderly.

07:46.132 --> 07:49.341
The killer brought a towel with him
to wrap around Ms. Trudeau's head

07:49.369 --> 07:51.315
when he brained her against the counter.

07:51.338 --> 07:54.376
- Professional.
- Yes... and no.

07:54.407 --> 07:57.320
He could've covered her face
to keep her from looking at him,

07:57.344 --> 07:59.324
to increase his own comfort level.

07:59.346 --> 08:01.121
And the fact that he vomited

08:01.147 --> 08:04.219
indicates that he doesn't have
the stomach to be a pro.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.457
A semi-professional hit man?

08:06.486 --> 08:08.830
As a matter of fact, yes.

08:08.855 --> 08:10.926
There's a profile in the literature.

08:10.957 --> 08:14.302
These boys don't derive their
entire income on contract killing.

08:14.327 --> 08:17.706
They hold regular jobs. They're
less impulsive than amateurs,

08:17.731 --> 08:19.677
but they score high on psychopathy

08:19.699 --> 08:21.542
with a history of prior violence.

08:21.568 --> 08:25.414
Street fights, barroom brawls,
domestic violence.

08:25.438 --> 08:28.681
Someone, a jealous wife might hire in a
Pinch, to whack her husband's mistress.

08:28.708 --> 08:31.086
- ( knocking )
- Come in.

08:31.111 --> 08:34.785
Carver: I've met Diane Blakemore.

08:34.813 --> 08:36.725
She's strictly Colony Club.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.787
She wouldn't know where to find a hit man.

08:38.818 --> 08:42.424
These are Emily Trudeau's cell phone
records for the last couple of months.

08:42.455 --> 08:45.868
She and Blakemore kept their
phone traffic pretty low-key,

08:45.892 --> 08:49.032
maybe one after-hours phone call

08:49.062 --> 08:50.973
every few days, if that.

08:50.997 --> 08:54.274
But during the last week,
she was calling Blakemore at home

08:54.300 --> 08:56.473
three or four times a night.

09:00.173 --> 09:03.086
Woman: I don't know what those
calls would've been about.

09:03.109 --> 09:06.249
Did she talk about her
relationship with the judge?

09:06.279 --> 09:07.917
She knew I didn't approve,

09:07.947 --> 09:09.585
but she was in love with him

09:09.616 --> 09:12.426
ever since she started working
for him 10 years ago.

09:12.452 --> 09:14.762
A long time to be somebody's mistress.

09:14.788 --> 09:17.769
Woman: She took it all, on his terms.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.395
Is this Emily's?

09:19.426 --> 09:21.099
Yes.

09:21.127 --> 09:22.868
- May I?
- Please.

09:22.896 --> 09:26.605
Eames: Could she have wanted
more from the relationship,

09:26.633 --> 09:28.635
maybe issued an ultimatum?

09:28.668 --> 09:30.705
She knew he would never leave his wife.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.080
Emily knew that.

09:36.309 --> 09:39.415
Summa cum laude at NYU.

09:39.446 --> 09:41.255
And "Law Review."

09:41.281 --> 09:42.988
She was an editor.

09:43.016 --> 09:46.020
Clerking for Blakemore was just
supposed to be a stepping stone.

09:52.992 --> 09:54.699
She wrote very well.

09:56.496 --> 09:59.033
She was so bright.

09:59.065 --> 10:03.013
Emily has a docking station for a laptop,

10:03.036 --> 10:04.572
but I don't see it.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.107
She took it to work every day.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.120
It wasn't at her office.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.588
And we didn't see it at Blakemore's.

10:14.481 --> 10:16.825
I have to be at Andrea's in 15 minutes.

10:16.850 --> 10:19.763
- This'll be done in no time.
- It's your daughter's baby shower.

10:19.786 --> 10:23.131
- What's so important you got to
pick it up this minute?
- I can't tell you.

10:23.156 --> 10:25.227
- Arnie!
- You don't want me to lie to you, right?

10:25.258 --> 10:27.966
So I can't tell you. But
it's all good, you'll see.

10:29.195 --> 10:30.970
It's all on here.

10:30.997 --> 10:33.341
What do you want me to do with the rest of it?

10:33.366 --> 10:35.175
Sell it for parts.

10:35.201 --> 10:38.114
- Just make sure that it can't be traced.
- Yeah, okay.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.812
I'm burning copies of the new
Jackie Chan movie, you want one?

10:40.840 --> 10:44.151
No. Dawn and me, we like romantic movies.

10:44.177 --> 10:46.054
Thanks.

10:48.381 --> 10:50.861
Harland finished his search
of Trudeau's office.

10:50.884 --> 10:53.364
No computer. Lab results of the puke sample--

10:53.386 --> 10:58.199
no DNA, no blood type. But they
found traces of tuna salad on rye.

10:58.224 --> 11:00.033
Emily Trudeau's greatest hits?

11:00.059 --> 11:01.970
"Free Speech and the Fair Use Doctrine:

11:01.995 --> 11:04.475
The First Amendment and Encryption Software."

11:04.497 --> 11:06.499
Stop it, you're making me hot.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.806
Maybe Emily Trudeau's "Law Review" articles

11:09.836 --> 11:12.680
are exactly what got Blakemore hot.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.489
Can you call Carver,

11:18.511 --> 11:21.014
see if he can get us in to see Blakemore?

11:21.047 --> 11:22.685
Where are you going?

11:23.850 --> 11:25.352
The law library.

11:27.954 --> 11:29.831
Blakemore: I hope you can appreciate

11:29.856 --> 11:32.666
I had to re-calendar two
suppression hearings for this.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.831
We appreciate it a lot, Your Honor.

11:34.861 --> 11:39.003
A few questions came up when we were
looking into your background.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.342
You checked his background?

11:41.367 --> 11:43.711
To assess any threats against him.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.179
Threats?

11:46.206 --> 11:48.516
This was a botched burglary, wasn't it?

11:48.541 --> 11:50.020
No.

11:50.043 --> 11:53.456
We heard you're up for a seat
on the Appellate Court.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.185
That's right.

11:56.216 --> 11:59.891
The fact that you’re being
considered is a tribute to you

11:59.919 --> 12:02.490
as a jurist and a legal scholar.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.565
Yes. I suppose it is. What is your question?

12:06.593 --> 12:08.470
You went to Yale?

12:08.494 --> 12:10.804
Yale and Columbia. I graduated from both.

12:10.830 --> 12:13.834
- You were "Law Review"?
- No.

12:13.866 --> 12:17.643
Or that other award that they give
to the top 10% of the class?

12:17.670 --> 12:20.116
- Order of the Coif?
- No.

12:20.139 --> 12:22.642
That's because you had a 2.0 average.

12:22.675 --> 12:25.155
- What do they call that?
- I don't know.

12:25.178 --> 12:27.920
Gentlemen's C's, isn't that it?

12:27.947 --> 12:31.360
If you came here to denigrate
my client's record...

12:31.384 --> 12:33.125
Goren: We like his record.

12:33.152 --> 12:37.157
We like the fact that he's a.. a late bloomer.

12:38.825 --> 12:43.205
All the articles that you've published
over these last few years...

12:44.197 --> 12:46.177
Like this one.

12:46.199 --> 12:48.702
"Intellectual Property Rights
in the New Millennium."

12:48.735 --> 12:49.839
What about it?

12:50.970 --> 12:55.476
"Conflicts between First Amendment rights and
intellectual property rights have traditionally

12:55.508 --> 12:58.921
been resolved in favor of the expansion
of intellectual property rights."

12:58.945 --> 13:01.118
It's clean concise.

13:02.482 --> 13:06.953
Did Junger v. Daley really hold
that the First Amendment

13:06.986 --> 13:09.489
doesn't protect software?

13:11.324 --> 13:13.326
Yes, it did. I don't see what this--

13:13.359 --> 13:16.533
Wait. No.

13:16.562 --> 13:19.133
Daley's a landmark case precisely because

13:19.165 --> 13:22.635
it held the First Amendment
does protect software.

13:22.669 --> 13:25.650
You read one article and
you think you're an expert.

13:25.672 --> 13:27.811
I've been researching this field for years.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.285
Eames: 10 years.

13:29.309 --> 13:32.483
Ever since Emily Trudeau went to work for you.

13:33.680 --> 13:36.160
Emily Trudeau graduated summa cum laude,

13:36.182 --> 13:39.186
Order of the Coif, "Law Review."

13:40.853 --> 13:43.163
What the hell are you insinuating?

13:51.698 --> 13:55.339
"Conflicts between First Amendment
rights and intellectual property rights

13:55.368 --> 13:58.372
have traditionally been
resolved in favor of..."

14:00.206 --> 14:02.208
Well, you know the rest.

14:03.276 --> 14:06.746
It's from "Free Speech and
the Fair Use Doctrine,"

14:06.779 --> 14:09.225
written by Emily Trudeau.

14:09.248 --> 14:12.127
Two years before she became your clerk.

14:12.151 --> 14:15.325
Either you stole her article
or she wrote it for you.

14:15.355 --> 14:18.063
It's ridiculous! It's defamatory!

14:18.091 --> 14:21.470
It's goodbye to the Appellate
Court if anybody finds out.

14:21.494 --> 14:23.804
What did Emily do, Judge,

14:23.830 --> 14:25.639
threaten to go public?

14:25.665 --> 14:27.702
- Don't answer that.
- No!

14:27.734 --> 14:29.509
Unless you, what,

14:29.535 --> 14:31.674
left your wife,

14:31.704 --> 14:33.411
gave her money?

14:33.439 --> 14:37.251
The proof was on her computer, which
is why you waited to call the police--

14:37.276 --> 14:38.448
so you could get rid of it.

14:38.478 --> 14:41.425
- Computer? She had her computer with her!
- No, not with her.

14:41.447 --> 14:44.018
Not in her office, not in her home.

15:01.300 --> 15:04.179
You really don't know
where that computer is, do you?

15:13.146 --> 15:15.956
But you're terrified because of what's on it.

15:28.327 --> 15:29.965
First you call him a plagiarist,

15:29.996 --> 15:31.634
then a murderer.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.371
Now you've changed your mind.

15:33.399 --> 15:35.811
This is no way to treat
a Justice of the New York Court.

15:35.835 --> 15:39.044
He still is a plagiarist, except
somebody else killed Emily Trudeau--

15:39.071 --> 15:40.550
killed her for her computer.

15:40.573 --> 15:44.316
The evidence she was ghost-writing
his articles was on that computer.

15:44.343 --> 15:46.653
If somebody wants to destroy Blakemore's rep,

15:46.679 --> 15:49.023
ruin his chances with the Appellate Court...

15:49.048 --> 15:52.427
Question is-- who wanted
Blakemore disqualified?

15:52.452 --> 15:55.160
We could always ask whoever
chooses Appellate Court judges.

15:55.188 --> 15:57.498
This I'll handle.

15:57.523 --> 16:00.129
I'll talk to the bipartisan
nominating committee

16:00.159 --> 16:02.469
and I'll let you know what I find out.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.608
You want to know how it really works,

16:11.637 --> 16:13.981
I got just the guy for you.

16:19.312 --> 16:23.454
His first job, it was bellhop
at the Biltmore, wasn't it, Jimmy?

16:23.483 --> 16:26.953
My mom marched me down
to Democratic Headquarters herself.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.693
Said I was a "hooligan in the making"

16:28.721 --> 16:32.294
and if anybody could set me
straight it was Mac McNeil.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.464
I need to get home.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.474
Fill them in, Mac.

16:36.496 --> 16:40.308
So what can I tell you about
the Honorable "Dutch" Blakemore?

16:40.333 --> 16:43.803
Let's start with people who'd want
to keep him off the Appellate Court.

16:43.836 --> 16:47.682
- Like?
- He might be the swing vote on
an important case.

16:47.707 --> 16:50.051
Or he rubs a special interest
group the wrong way.

16:50.076 --> 16:52.488
Everybody loves Dutch Blakemore.

16:52.512 --> 16:55.152
He didn't strike us as very lovable.

16:55.181 --> 16:59.652
When you've raised $10 million for the
party's candidates in the last election,

16:59.685 --> 17:01.858
people will overlook your shortcomings.

17:01.888 --> 17:03.458
So that's what counts here,

17:03.489 --> 17:05.935
fundraising for the right party.

17:05.958 --> 17:09.770
Where did you think Appellate
Court judges came from?

17:09.795 --> 17:12.070
Any other judges in the running?

17:12.098 --> 17:13.873
Four--

17:13.900 --> 17:17.643
Rasmussen, Fuller, Sabatelli and Zimmer.

17:17.670 --> 17:21.413
But Dutch is the front runner by a long mile.

17:22.775 --> 17:25.050
Because everybody loves Dutch.

17:25.077 --> 17:27.614
Ask the Bar Association.

17:27.646 --> 17:30.651
They hold public hearings
on the candidates.

17:32.018 --> 17:34.624
We looked at Judge Blakemore's
record pretty closely

17:34.654 --> 17:38.124
and I don't recall that he ever took
a stand on any controversial issue.

17:38.157 --> 17:41.297
What about pending appeals he might
be facing on the Appellate Court--

17:41.327 --> 17:43.068
organized crime cases, drug cases?

17:43.095 --> 17:44.665
Nothing of any consequence.

17:44.697 --> 17:48.167
Anything come up in the public hearings?
Maybe a personal gripe?

17:48.200 --> 17:50.806
I don't recall. Can you check?

17:50.836 --> 17:53.282
There's always a personal gripe of some kind--

17:53.306 --> 17:56.981
co-op neighbors who don't think
the nominee pays his dues on time.

17:57.009 --> 17:59.512
Here, there was one name on the witness list.

17:59.545 --> 18:02.082
- But she was a no-show.
- Her name?

18:02.114 --> 18:04.253
Duval. Marie Duval.

18:04.283 --> 18:06.923
Doesn't say what her complaint was.

18:06.953 --> 18:10.765
In hindsight, maybe I was wrong to back out.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.861
But I'm up for partner next year.

18:12.892 --> 18:15.168
Why should I be the next Anita Hill?

18:15.194 --> 18:17.606
Blakemore sexually harassed you?

18:17.630 --> 18:19.769
I was his clerk back in the '80s.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.472
During a sexual battery case,

18:21.500 --> 18:24.777
he told me he liked watching
S&M scenes in pornos.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.784
Was it ever anything more than talk?

18:26.806 --> 18:28.308
He never laid a hand on me.

18:28.341 --> 18:30.821
On anyone else, I can't vouch for.

18:32.311 --> 18:33.847
He harassed other women?

18:33.879 --> 18:36.621
Guys like him can't help themselves.

18:36.649 --> 18:39.095
Do you know who these women are?

18:39.118 --> 18:42.588
No, but when I didn't appear
at the hearing, I got a call--

18:42.622 --> 18:45.626
he said he was a concerned citizen.

18:45.658 --> 18:48.298
It was probably some girl's
boyfriend or brother.

18:48.327 --> 18:51.001
He said that Blakemore was
a fraud, a womanizer,

18:51.030 --> 18:54.307
and that it wasn't too late
for me to testify.

18:54.333 --> 18:56.472
Did this citizen identify himself?

18:56.502 --> 18:59.142
No. He hung up when I asked him his name.

18:59.171 --> 19:01.583
I star-69'd him and a dispatcher answered.

19:01.607 --> 19:04.781
It was a car service. "Smooth Ride."

19:08.614 --> 19:10.924
Yeah, I remember getting that call.

19:10.950 --> 19:13.260
All the incoming calls get routed to me.

19:13.285 --> 19:17.324
I told that lady I got 102 drivers,
42 cars, each one with a cell phone.

19:17.356 --> 19:19.063
I got no way of knowing who called her.

19:19.091 --> 19:20.934
That's what she said you told her.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.566
- Same thing I told the other lady.
- What other lady?

19:23.596 --> 19:26.042
Another lawyer. She comes
down here a week later.

19:26.065 --> 19:28.875
She says she's getting crank calls
from one of our numbers.

19:28.901 --> 19:31.745
She said if I didn't help her, her
boss is going to put me in contempt.

19:31.771 --> 19:35.617
- Her boss was a judge?
- That's what she said.

19:37.677 --> 19:40.453
Yeah, that's the one who showed up here.

19:41.447 --> 19:44.951
I had to pull the logs on every phone
till I found one with her number on it.

19:44.984 --> 19:46.793
You still have those records?

19:46.819 --> 19:49.698
I don't need a judge putting me in contempt.

19:51.323 --> 19:52.961
Goren: Who had this phone?

19:52.992 --> 19:54.562
This day? That's just it.

19:54.593 --> 19:56.630
4 different drivers could've used it.

19:56.662 --> 19:58.972
3 calls to Emily's number at the courthouse.

19:58.998 --> 20:01.308
This number here, right after the second call,

20:01.333 --> 20:03.939
to the 248 exchange? That's
the probation office.

20:07.673 --> 20:10.017
Arnie: You said to shut her up.
She knew my name.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.919
How else am I supposed to shut her up?

20:11.944 --> 20:14.788
What the hell were you thinking
going to his house?

20:14.814 --> 20:16.657
That was a good thing. It was good.

20:16.682 --> 20:18.525
What was the good thing about it, Arnie?

20:18.551 --> 20:21.293
For God's sake, sometimes I think
you're dumber than you look.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.630
You didn't see what I got for you.

20:23.656 --> 20:27.502
From her computer. And don't
worry, I got rid of it.

20:27.526 --> 20:29.506
This is pretty good, huh?

20:29.528 --> 20:32.099
See, I anticipated what you wanted.

20:32.131 --> 20:34.839
I always anticipate.

20:34.867 --> 20:37.370
You want me to get you some water?

20:40.439 --> 20:42.009
Eames: This one's a cream puff

20:42.041 --> 20:45.181
Two shoplifting beefs,
and one for passing bad checks.

20:45.211 --> 20:47.691
This one's got three assaults. Arnie Cox.

20:47.713 --> 20:52.025
Was fired from his last
two jobs for violent outbursts.

20:52.051 --> 20:53.758
A history of violence.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.527
Sounds like a distinguishing feature

20:55.554 --> 20:58.364
of the semi-professional hit man.

20:58.390 --> 21:01.667
I only look like I'm not
paying attention to you.

21:07.166 --> 21:09.976
- You need to close ranks.
- What're you talking about?

21:10.002 --> 21:12.812
He's setting up a Seven Stars offense, right?

21:12.838 --> 21:15.182
- What're you, an expert?
- I'm a cop.

21:15.207 --> 21:16.811
So's she.

21:17.843 --> 21:19.686
And you're under arrest.

21:22.848 --> 21:24.691
Your move.

21:28.554 --> 21:30.830
Arnie: It's not that I don't have counsel.

21:30.856 --> 21:33.837
It's just that he costs me
a hundred bucks an hour.

21:33.859 --> 21:35.668
And if I thought I needed him...

21:35.694 --> 21:37.833
I know you folks are just doing your job.

21:37.863 --> 21:41.174
And anybody that likes
Chinese chess can't be all bad.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.680
- Where'd you learn, anyways?
- China.

21:43.702 --> 21:46.911
Yeah? Me too.

21:48.207 --> 21:50.687
No, I'm just pulling your leg.

21:50.709 --> 21:54.350
Anyways, I never made
any calls to Emily Trudeau.

21:54.380 --> 21:56.360
But you heard about her murder?

21:56.382 --> 21:58.191
Who didn't?

21:58.217 --> 22:01.528
- You were working that night.
- Now you see? I got an alibi.

22:01.554 --> 22:04.091
Eames: That's a little optimistic.

22:04.123 --> 22:07.798
There was plenty of time to do the murder
in between your runs to JFK.

22:07.827 --> 22:12.207
I had the trots, from eating too much grease.

22:12.231 --> 22:14.211
Goren: Speaking of

22:14.233 --> 22:16.509
what would you say if I told you we found DNA

22:16.535 --> 22:18.378
in some vomit on the crime scene?

22:19.505 --> 22:21.314
I'd say that's a good one, Bobby.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.650
You had DNA, I wouldn't be here.

22:23.676 --> 22:26.054
I'd be sitting in some doctor's office

22:26.078 --> 22:28.649
with a court-ordered needle in my vein.

22:28.681 --> 22:31.184
That's a good one, Arnie.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.167
You've got quite a career.

22:37.189 --> 22:39.294
Arnie: Turned over a new leaf

22:41.026 --> 22:43.028
A judge cut you a break.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.969
Judge Sabatelli.

23:08.654 --> 23:11.828
Isn't he the guy who writes
novels in his spare time?

23:14.660 --> 23:16.162
I don't know.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.076
I just got lucky.

23:22.101 --> 23:24.172
I could've been in front of Judge Susser.

23:24.203 --> 23:26.581
That guy's got a broomstick up his ass.

23:29.008 --> 23:32.148
Something just occurred to me.

23:32.177 --> 23:34.350
Sabatelli's up for the Appellate Court.

23:35.514 --> 23:37.118
Oh, yeah?

23:37.149 --> 23:39.789
You didn't know?

23:40.853 --> 23:42.628
Why would I?

23:43.622 --> 23:45.693
Your favorite judge.

23:48.027 --> 23:50.029
You know what, Bobby?

23:51.697 --> 23:53.540
I'm done talking today.

24:04.310 --> 24:06.950
- Raoul Sabatelli?
- That's where it's going.

24:06.979 --> 24:08.549
Or where you're taking it.

24:08.580 --> 24:10.287
Every time Sabatelli's name came up,

24:10.316 --> 24:11.989
Arnie's pulse went up 20 clicks.

24:12.017 --> 24:13.428
Right along with mine. Look,

24:13.452 --> 24:16.023
I know Sabatelli's a little
rough around the edges--

24:16.055 --> 24:18.968
- Golden Gloves, right?
- Forget about Sabatelli for a second,

24:18.991 --> 24:20.595
worry about this mutt.

24:20.626 --> 24:23.129
You think he stole the
girl's computer, right?

24:23.162 --> 24:25.403
Get a search warrant.

24:25.431 --> 24:27.308
You care who we ask?

24:36.008 --> 24:39.979
Sabatelli: You’re a little
light on probable cause here.

24:40.012 --> 24:42.515
You were a Golden Gloves Champ in '59?

24:42.548 --> 24:45.324
Why? You want to go a few rounds?

24:45.351 --> 24:47.160
( chuckles )

24:47.186 --> 24:49.962
The phone calls-- there's
no certainty he made them.

24:49.989 --> 24:52.629
Isn't that why they call it
probable cause, Your Honor?

24:52.658 --> 24:54.968
Don't get smart with me.

24:55.961 --> 24:57.998
Goren: You knew this defendant?

24:58.030 --> 25:01.102
Yeah, he's made a few appearances in my part.

25:01.133 --> 25:03.613
You think murder's out of his reach?

25:03.635 --> 25:07.981
My years on the bench have taught me
that anybody is capable of anything.

25:08.007 --> 25:10.544
Isn't that a line from one of your books?

25:12.311 --> 25:14.621
My first book, "The Serpent's Tooth."

25:18.317 --> 25:20.661
Look at this. Is this a French edition?

25:20.686 --> 25:24.930
My books have been translated
into nine different languages.

25:24.957 --> 25:27.494
That's the latest.

25:28.761 --> 25:31.674
"La Ville Sanglante." "Bloody City."

25:33.098 --> 25:34.668
This is very cool.

25:35.834 --> 25:38.144
This one I haven't seen before.

25:38.170 --> 25:39.808
"West Side Danny."

25:39.838 --> 25:42.580
That's out of print.

25:45.511 --> 25:47.855
I'd love to read it.

25:51.350 --> 25:53.853
Could-- could I buy it from you?

25:53.919 --> 25:56.991
( laughs )
Just go ahead. It's on me.

25:57.022 --> 25:59.161
Goren: Thank you.

25:59.191 --> 26:01.933
Eames: Your Honor; the search warrant?

26:01.960 --> 26:03.803
Oh.

26:05.130 --> 26:07.269
Yeah, okay, what the hell.

26:07.299 --> 26:10.143
You want to go fishing, be my guest.

26:14.306 --> 26:17.378
Since you're signing things, do you mind?

26:23.816 --> 26:26.126
We don't have any computers here.

26:26.151 --> 26:28.961
We don't even know how to work the video.

26:28.987 --> 26:31.365
They won't break anything, will they?

26:31.390 --> 26:34.599
- They know not to.
- It's Judge Sabatelli.

26:34.626 --> 26:38.574
- That belongs to my husband.
- Why do you have it?

26:38.597 --> 26:40.975
He think very highly of the judge.

26:40.999 --> 26:43.809
He's from very humble
circumstances, like Arnie.

26:43.836 --> 26:46.476
He gave Arnie a break when he didn't have to.

26:46.505 --> 26:48.314
It's from the newspaper.

26:48.340 --> 26:51.810
One of the papers did an article on
the judge. Arnie clipped it out.

26:51.844 --> 26:54.654
- This is from a newspaper, too.
- That was two years ago.

26:54.680 --> 26:58.321
The judge hired Arnie to drive him
to some fancy political thing.

26:58.350 --> 27:02.765
- Eames: The judge throw a lot of work his way?
- Woman: On occasion.

27:02.788 --> 27:05.598
So Arnie has all of Sabatelli's novels.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.433
Looks like he's read them a few times.

27:07.459 --> 27:08.938
Woman: They came like that.

27:08.961 --> 27:10.907
He bought them at the flea market.

27:20.806 --> 27:23.446
Arnie's locker at the limo company was clean.

27:23.475 --> 27:26.786
No computer, nothing to
connect him to the murder.

27:26.812 --> 27:29.622
You underline the dirty parts?

27:29.648 --> 27:31.821
The sex is pretty robust.

27:33.485 --> 27:36.364
It's Jimmy Breslin meets Daphne DuMaurier.

27:36.388 --> 27:40.734
"Judge Wakefield was the worst kind
of American aristocrat,

27:40.759 --> 27:43.501
the kind who was born on third base
and thought he hit a triple."

27:44.496 --> 27:46.601
Wakefield's one of his recurring characters.

27:48.333 --> 27:52.145
"Wakefield majored in drinking at Yale
and whored his way through Columbia.

27:52.171 --> 27:55.380
That and marrying the granddaughter
of a New York Supreme Court Justice

27:55.407 --> 27:58.650
was the sum total of his legal education."

27:58.677 --> 28:03.126
"Wakefield sat in silence,
to all appearances in deep meditation

28:03.148 --> 28:06.095
on the grave Constitutional issue before him.

28:06.118 --> 28:09.099
But Wakefield wasn't meditating on anything.

28:09.121 --> 28:10.998
He didn't have an opinion on the matter.

28:11.023 --> 28:14.266
So he did what he usually did
when he had no opinion.

28:14.293 --> 28:16.603
He borrowed one."

28:16.628 --> 28:19.131
Wakefield is Blakemore.

28:24.803 --> 28:27.784
Goren: In the first edition
of Sabatelli's second book,

28:27.806 --> 28:30.286
Wakefield's wife was named Diane,

28:30.309 --> 28:33.119
which happens to be the same
name as Blakemore's wife.

28:33.145 --> 28:35.785
But the name was changed
in subsequent editions.

28:35.814 --> 28:38.124
Yeah, that was a creative decision.

28:38.150 --> 28:40.960
Inspired by the threat of a lawsuit?

28:40.986 --> 28:43.330
Raoul was not happy.

28:43.355 --> 28:46.734
In the right light, you can see
where we plastered over the hole

28:46.758 --> 28:48.362
he made with his fist.

28:48.393 --> 28:49.963
What's his beef with Blakemore?

28:49.995 --> 28:51.997
We know they both went to Columbia.

28:52.030 --> 28:55.011
Ah, yes. Raoul went on scholarship.

28:55.033 --> 28:57.274
Blakemore went on his father's dime.

28:57.302 --> 28:59.077
Raoul got the straight A's,

28:59.104 --> 29:02.210
but Blakemore got the invitations
to the faculty club.

29:04.610 --> 29:07.682
- Sabatelli, Ron.
- Yes, Judge.

29:07.713 --> 29:09.249
You need to be straight with me.

29:09.281 --> 29:10.760
Where are they going with this?

29:10.782 --> 29:13.262
- Where is who going with what?
- The Blakemore case.

29:13.285 --> 29:16.095
- The detectives are investigating me.
- I wasn't aware.

29:16.121 --> 29:19.898
You point the finger at Blakemore and
everyone says, "Not him. It couldn't be him."

29:19.925 --> 29:21.871
Point the finger at Sabatelli and they say,

29:21.893 --> 29:24.305
"What do you expect from
some punk from the streets?"

29:24.329 --> 29:27.208
- Nobody is saying--
- If they point the finger at you, Ron,

29:27.232 --> 29:31.112
what would they say?
You know exactly what they'd say.

29:35.641 --> 29:37.882
Carver: Sabatelli hates Blakemore.

29:37.909 --> 29:39.946
He hates Zimmer, he hates Rasmussen,

29:39.978 --> 29:41.958
he hates Lewin, he hates McCoy.

29:41.980 --> 29:43.789
He hates everybody equally.

29:43.815 --> 29:45.226
He doesn't seem to hate you.

29:45.250 --> 29:47.059
We served on committees together.

29:47.085 --> 29:50.658
I admire him as a maverick, a man who
lifted himself up from the streets.

29:50.689 --> 29:53.966
- He doesn't see me as a threat.
- That's how he sees Blakemore!

29:53.992 --> 29:56.165
He's paranoid, pathological.

29:56.194 --> 29:58.401
Is that police code for "hot-blooded"?

29:58.430 --> 30:02.173
Well, don't put words in my mouth,
or some kind of attitude.

30:02.200 --> 30:06.671
If he's involved, why on earth would
he sign a search warrant for Mr. Cox?

30:06.705 --> 30:09.549
- Goren: He knew we wouldn't find anything.
- That's paranoid.

30:09.574 --> 30:13.249
We could throw Sabatelli another
hot potato, see how he handles it.

30:14.279 --> 30:17.351
Arnie Cox made harassing
calls to Emily Trudeau.

30:17.382 --> 30:20.124
You charge him with violating his probation.

30:20.152 --> 30:22.154
Since he was Sabatelli's defendant,

30:22.187 --> 30:24.997
it'll end up in Sabatelli's lap.

30:26.491 --> 30:28.596
If Sabatelli revokes his probation,

30:28.627 --> 30:30.971
Arnie goes back to prison for 5-to-10.

30:30.996 --> 30:32.998
If you're right about Sabatelli,

30:33.031 --> 30:35.511
he won't want to alienate Mr. Cox.

30:35.534 --> 30:39.107
And if you're right about him, then he
won't have a problem locking him up.

30:40.706 --> 30:42.447
Very slick, Detective.

30:44.976 --> 30:46.785
It's a damn trap, Henry.

30:46.812 --> 30:49.349
It's only a trap if Arnie Cox can hurt you.

30:49.381 --> 30:51.156
Be straight with me, Raoul.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.459
As your attorney I need to know.

30:53.485 --> 30:55.089
I don't like surprises.

30:55.120 --> 30:57.896
He's a nothing little mouse.
But you see what's happening?

30:57.923 --> 31:01.302
- They're all closing ranks around Blakemore.
- Raoul.

31:01.326 --> 31:03.272
The fact that I'm even a suspect--

31:03.295 --> 31:05.536
you have any idea what that does to my chances

31:05.564 --> 31:07.635
for the Appellate Court, Henry?

31:07.666 --> 31:10.112
I am this close, and they can't stand it!

31:10.135 --> 31:13.639
- Well, you're right about that.
- Because I don't fill their coffers,

31:13.672 --> 31:14.844
I don't kiss ass.

31:14.873 --> 31:17.479
I've just worked hard my whole life!

31:17.509 --> 31:20.922
Raoul, if Arnie Cox really can't hurt you,

31:20.946 --> 31:24.553
all you'd be doing is locking up
a defendant on a probation violation.

31:24.583 --> 31:27.189
No big deal.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.062
Right, Raoul?

31:37.662 --> 31:41.007
Carver: The defendant placed
harassing phone calls to Ms. Trudeau

31:41.032 --> 31:42.909
only days before her murder.

31:42.934 --> 31:46.347
They can't prove the calls were harassing
without a complaining witness.

31:46.371 --> 31:48.681
Carver: She's dead, which is exactly our point.

31:48.707 --> 31:51.017
There's no other explanation for the calls.

31:51.042 --> 31:52.680
All right.

31:52.711 --> 31:55.692
Mr. Gruber, I have bent over backward

31:55.714 --> 31:59.856
to give your client second,
third and fourth chances.

31:59.885 --> 32:04.300
But it seems he took advantage
of my generous nature.

32:04.322 --> 32:06.598
I'm finding him in violation
of his probation

32:06.625 --> 32:09.902
and remanding him to the custody
of the Department of Corrections

32:09.928 --> 32:12.408
to serve out the balance of his sentence.

32:16.001 --> 32:18.003
Come.

32:29.114 --> 32:30.593
Case closed.

32:39.024 --> 32:42.005
It ain't like he had much choice.

32:42.027 --> 32:44.064
After everything you've done for him,

32:44.095 --> 32:46.302
he's supposed to take care of you.

32:46.331 --> 32:50.143
Your lawyer's not here,
so you should just listen.

32:51.703 --> 32:53.774
You know, think things over.

32:58.877 --> 33:00.914
Sabatelli gave me this.

33:03.181 --> 33:05.127
See? He signed it.

33:09.988 --> 33:12.935
Your copies are all secondhand.
Not one of them is signed.

33:12.958 --> 33:15.962
Yeah, so what?

33:18.497 --> 33:20.477
Have you read his latest book?

33:20.499 --> 33:23.275
I haven't gotten to it yet.

33:23.301 --> 33:25.747
You should, you're in it.

33:27.172 --> 33:30.676
"Donnie was a small-time crook
who embellished his criminal past

33:30.709 --> 33:33.053
and bragged about being a big-time robber."

33:34.312 --> 33:36.292
That ain't me. He just made that up.

33:36.314 --> 33:40.160
"Donnie was like one
of those silly little terriers,

33:40.185 --> 33:42.665
always in tune to his master's moods,

33:42.687 --> 33:45.463
always eager to please,
and that made him useful."

33:45.490 --> 33:47.766
Look, I told you, that ain't me.

33:47.792 --> 33:49.794
"As a kid, Donnie was a bed-wetter;

33:49.828 --> 33:52.604
and his old man beat the
crap out of him for it

33:52.631 --> 33:57.273
until Child Welfare sent him to live
with his alcoholic grandmother.

33:58.670 --> 34:02.482
The night of his first arrest,
he pissed himself

34:04.376 --> 34:06.481
He was 17."

34:23.661 --> 34:26.108
None of that stuff matters, baby.

34:26.130 --> 34:28.407
You're my guy and I love you.

34:28.433 --> 34:32.472
- Your family loves you.
- I can’t just flip on him.

34:32.504 --> 34:35.643
- I can't.
- I know it's hard for you.

34:35.674 --> 34:37.312
You never turned on anybody.

34:37.342 --> 34:39.322
But this time it's different.

34:39.344 --> 34:41.824
It's him or you.

34:41.846 --> 34:45.487
I can't. I only did what he wanted me to do.

34:45.516 --> 34:48.293
For once can't you do what I want?

34:48.320 --> 34:52.598
Please, baby, I can't lose you forever.

34:58.763 --> 35:01.607
A deal? In return for what?
What's he offering?

35:01.633 --> 35:04.113
He said Sabatelli told him
o do what he had to

35:04.135 --> 35:06.081
to get proof of Blakemore's plagiarism.

35:06.104 --> 35:09.779
When Emily Trudeau found out
Arnie was calling her,

35:09.808 --> 35:12.345
Sabatelli got worried
the trail would lead to him,

35:12.377 --> 35:13.947
so he told Arnie to shut her up.

35:13.979 --> 35:17.859
Arnie had the bright idea of killing her
in Blakemore's house to embarrass him.

35:17.882 --> 35:19.919
Getting the computer was a bonus.

35:19.951 --> 35:21.589
What happened to the computer?

35:21.620 --> 35:25.158
Arnie made a copy of the computer disk
and gave it to Sabatelli.

35:26.157 --> 35:29.969
- He made a copy for himself as insurance.
- What's on it?

35:29.995 --> 35:33.533
Drafts of articles she was
ghost-writing for Blakemore,

35:33.565 --> 35:36.512
e-mails discussing the articles.

35:39.871 --> 35:43.114
I can't believe Sabatelli would do this.

35:44.142 --> 35:46.349
Of all the foolish, arrogant--

35:54.519 --> 35:56.658
Granting this is all true,

35:56.688 --> 35:59.032
he's only liable for conspiracy.

36:01.126 --> 36:03.436
I can't convict him solely
on the testimony

36:03.461 --> 36:06.533
of his co-conspirators. I need corroboration.

36:07.766 --> 36:10.872
If Sabatelli still had a copy of the disk,
and if we could find it?

36:10.902 --> 36:12.745
That would do it. But at this point,

36:12.771 --> 36:14.580
what are the chances he still has it?

36:14.606 --> 36:17.951
Is it enough to prove that he knows
what's on the disk?

36:20.311 --> 36:23.258
What are you suggesting, a pop quiz?

36:23.281 --> 36:26.421
Or an opportunity that he can't resist.

36:28.653 --> 36:31.497
I've been rethinking our case, Counselor.

36:32.490 --> 36:34.470
We were right the first time.

36:34.492 --> 36:38.634
If anyone had the motive
to kill Emily Trudeau...

36:39.764 --> 36:43.177
And destroy the contents on her computer,

36:44.169 --> 36:45.910
it's Judge Blakemore.

36:47.839 --> 36:49.716
You want to arrest Blakemore?

36:54.212 --> 36:55.816
Well...

36:55.847 --> 36:59.021
Arrest would-- would be an understatement.

37:09.461 --> 37:13.568
Ron. Ron. Is it true what they say?
Blakemore's the guy?

37:13.598 --> 37:17.102
So it appears. I told you
your concerns were premature.

37:17.135 --> 37:19.411
Blakemore is a big fish.
This is good for you, Ron.

37:19.437 --> 37:21.508
If it doesn't turn into a three-ring circus.

37:21.539 --> 37:23.246
Lewin wants everything by the book.

37:23.274 --> 37:26.278
I'm thinking of having someone
from the Judicial Committee of the Bar

37:26.311 --> 37:28.086
observe the interrogation.

37:28.113 --> 37:29.956
I serve on that committee.

37:29.981 --> 37:32.518
Really?

37:32.550 --> 37:36.157
This is asinine. Emily never said
anything to me about this Arnie Cox.

37:36.187 --> 37:38.292
She told you about the phone calls she got.

37:38.323 --> 37:39.734
- Yes, but--
- Judge.

37:39.758 --> 37:42.637
- Look at him.
- Eames: Emily was a liability.

37:42.660 --> 37:46.164
He probably never sat on the wrong side
of an interrogation before.

37:46.197 --> 37:49.371
- You have?
- When I was a kid.

37:49.400 --> 37:52.472
In my neighborhood,
getting pinched was part of puberty.

37:52.504 --> 37:55.246
- This is crazy!
- You're not denying she was

37:55.273 --> 37:57.651
writing those articles for you, are you?

37:57.675 --> 38:00.246
- She was not.
- He's lying.

38:00.278 --> 38:02.622
He's never had an
original thought in his life.

38:02.647 --> 38:07.062
We found drafts of articles
in her home, correspondence--

38:07.085 --> 38:10.294
here, this copy of an e-mail
she sent you last December.

38:10.321 --> 38:13.234
“I'm almost finished with the final draft,

38:13.258 --> 38:16.603
and I'm pretty sure the “Georgetown
Law Review” will be interested in it.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.972
It'll be quite a feather in your cap.”

38:18.997 --> 38:20.601
That could mean anything.

38:20.632 --> 38:23.169
It means you'd be out of the running
for the Appellate Court.

38:23.201 --> 38:26.011
You were worried those other guys
would get the job--

38:26.037 --> 38:29.382
Rasmussen, Fuller or Sabatelli.

38:29.407 --> 38:31.819
Sabatelli? He's a thug.

38:31.843 --> 38:34.517
They put his name in the race
just to make it look fair.

38:34.546 --> 38:36.719
Eames: What about the e-mail, Judge?

38:36.748 --> 38:39.092
We found that article
in the "Georgetown Law Review,"

38:39.117 --> 38:41.495
published last spring under your name.

38:41.519 --> 38:44.796
You mean, "The Constitutionalization
of the internet"?

38:44.823 --> 38:46.393
Detective, I know what I wrote.

38:47.225 --> 38:49.899
You'll never get him this way.
He's not an idiot.

38:49.928 --> 38:52.738
Use the actual articles against him.

38:52.764 --> 38:55.643
Eames: You were worried your secret was out.

38:55.667 --> 38:58.511
Blakemore: Oh, please. This is crazy!

39:08.613 --> 39:10.923
Judge Sabatelli thinks
we should test Blakemore

39:10.949 --> 39:12.951
on the contents of the articles.

39:12.984 --> 39:14.554
Take it from a writer--

39:14.586 --> 39:17.897
if they're his, he'll know them inside out.

39:19.524 --> 39:21.526
He might have written some of them.

39:21.559 --> 39:23.163
That'll be the day.

39:23.194 --> 39:26.767
Ask him about the one of software encryption.

39:26.798 --> 39:30.109
"Intellectual Property
and the Shifting Paradigm"?

39:30.134 --> 39:33.172
Yeah. Yeah, that's the one.
He didn't write that. I know he didn't.

39:33.204 --> 39:35.548
It's almost two years old.

39:35.573 --> 39:39.043
I have a hard time remembering
briefs I wrote two months ago.

39:39.077 --> 39:42.752
- It won't convince a jury.
- Then use something recent.

39:42.780 --> 39:46.227
The last "Law Review" we have is 6 months old.

39:48.152 --> 39:51.531
Didn't you say you found
drafts of articles in the girl's home?

39:51.556 --> 39:53.797
I don't have dates on those.

39:53.825 --> 39:57.500
Try "The Role of the Judicial Review in the--

39:57.528 --> 40:00.771
in the Digital Copyright Act."

40:01.900 --> 40:03.174
That's very recent.

40:05.503 --> 40:07.676
Some of these don't have titles.

40:08.673 --> 40:10.277
It starts,

40:10.308 --> 40:14.154
"Traditionally, the oversight role
of the judiciary in the area--"

40:14.178 --> 40:17.751
"...in the area of the Constitutional limits
of database protection"?

40:19.183 --> 40:21.390
Yes, that's it. You found it.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.592
Yes, it's right here.

40:23.621 --> 40:26.067
How do you know this article so well?

40:26.090 --> 40:28.661
Because I read it.

40:28.693 --> 40:31.196
Goren: Where?

40:31.229 --> 40:35.837
Because, funny thing is,
it hasn't been published yet.

40:35.867 --> 40:38.211
Emily Trudeau was still polishing it.

40:48.046 --> 40:51.516
Well, if you found drafts of the article...

40:52.517 --> 40:54.827
I'm sure there were
other copies circulating.

40:54.852 --> 40:57.458
I probably read one of those.

40:59.657 --> 41:02.467
Well... no.

41:02.493 --> 41:04.473
There are no copies.

41:04.495 --> 41:06.532
We found this the same place you did,

41:06.564 --> 41:08.635
on a disk from her computer.

41:08.666 --> 41:10.612
Carver:  A disk Arnie Cox gave us.

41:10.635 --> 41:12.774
Identical to the one he gave you.

41:12.804 --> 41:14.875
N-no.

41:14.906 --> 41:16.613
No, that is not right!

41:16.641 --> 41:18.882
Mr. Cox told us everything.

41:18.910 --> 41:20.947
What does he know? It's Blakemore!

41:20.979 --> 41:22.822
You don't really believe that.

41:22.847 --> 41:25.418
Yes, yes, he killed her
with his own bare hands!

41:25.450 --> 41:27.225
You know he's not capable of it.

41:27.251 --> 41:29.925
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about!

41:36.027 --> 41:39.372
"Of all the crimes that paraded
through his courtroom...

41:41.366 --> 41:44.142
The one Wakefield
never understood was murder.

41:48.206 --> 41:52.052
Murder required passion, guts...

41:54.579 --> 41:56.923
And in his heart,

41:56.948 --> 41:59.451
Wakefield knew he had neither."

42:12.330 --> 42:15.311
But you, on the other hand...

42:16.300 --> 42:20.112
You have plenty of both.

42:24.942 --> 42:28.048
You sons of bitches!

42:28.079 --> 42:30.025
He put you up to this.

42:30.048 --> 42:31.994
You trapped me.

42:32.016 --> 42:34.223
And I thought I could trust you, Ron!

42:34.252 --> 42:36.630
I thought I could trust you, Judge.

42:46.197 --> 42:48.040
Carver: Raoul Sabatelli,

42:48.066 --> 42:51.172
you're under arrest for
conspiracy to commit murder.

43:02.980 --> 43:06.894
Marie Duval told us how much
you like the rough stuff, Judge.

43:07.885 --> 43:10.058
No, don't let it get to you.

43:10.088 --> 43:13.092
- Should we break the news to him?
- Let him sweat a little more.

43:14.158 --> 43:16.468
Sabatelli and Blakemore...

43:16.494 --> 43:19.304
Violated the first rule
you learn in law school.

43:19.330 --> 43:22.311
Never commit anything to paper.

43:33.811 --> 43:35.848
( theme music playing )
