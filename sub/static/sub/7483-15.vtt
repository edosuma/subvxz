WEBVTT

00:27.194 --> 00:29.461
Must be our guy.

00:29.463 --> 00:31.063
What do you think he wants?

00:31.065 --> 00:33.432
What, he can't just be
a good Samaritan?

00:33.434 --> 00:37.136
Tip about a possible
missing NSA agent

00:37.138 --> 00:39.371
out of the goodness
of his heart?

00:39.373 --> 00:41.707
(chuckles)
Maybe in Kansas.

00:43.677 --> 00:46.078
Never want to meet at
a Starbucks, do they?

00:46.080 --> 00:47.379
No, they don't.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.356
NCIS.

00:57.358 --> 00:59.124
You have some
information for us?

01:01.162 --> 01:02.394
It's a set-up.

01:04.498 --> 01:07.666
(high-pitched tone)

01:07.668 --> 01:10.803
(groans)

01:13.707 --> 01:15.541
(grunting)

01:29.457 --> 01:32.424
¶ ¶

01:55.449 --> 01:57.449
Oh, my God.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.751
This is so good.

01:59.753 --> 02:01.854
Uh, what's the name
of the food truck

02:01.856 --> 02:03.889
that you're having
this religious experience with?

02:03.891 --> 02:05.724
Wholesome Food
for Life On Wheels.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.860
And I-I got to be
completely honest with you.

02:07.862 --> 02:09.862
I feel like eating clean
has changed my life.

02:09.864 --> 02:11.763
You know what I mean?

02:11.765 --> 02:14.533
I'm healthier, I feel better,
I got more energy,

02:14.535 --> 02:15.734
my focus is stronger--

02:15.736 --> 02:17.369
it's-it's like a...
it's like a miracle.

02:17.371 --> 02:18.770
It's a joke is what it is.

02:18.772 --> 02:20.305
And there it is on cue.

02:20.306 --> 02:21.839
Negative Nelly makes
an appearance. Thanks for that.

02:21.842 --> 02:24.776
Negative Nelly?
I just... I don't
understand why you do that.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.278
Do what?

02:26.280 --> 02:27.746
Every time I find something
I'm excited about,

02:27.748 --> 02:29.331
that I'm passionate about,
that's good for me,

02:29.332 --> 02:30.915
you just got to go,
and you got to tear it down.

02:30.918 --> 02:32.618
No, I'm just
saying that because...

02:32.620 --> 02:34.386
And this place is
the healthiest.

02:34.388 --> 02:36.622
It's-it's fresh,
and it's certified organic,

02:36.624 --> 02:38.790
and it's sustainably-farmed,
and it's...

02:38.792 --> 02:40.292
Frozen.

02:40.294 --> 02:41.460
I'm sorry. What did you say?

02:41.462 --> 02:43.195
It's frozen.

02:43.196 --> 02:44.929
I saw them load the truck
at Smart and Final.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.231
No way.
Way.

02:46.233 --> 02:47.900
Kensi Blye guarantee.

02:47.902 --> 02:50.269
Kensi Blye guarantee.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.271
Damn it!

02:52.273 --> 02:53.772
Those con men.

02:53.774 --> 02:55.774
Those conniving, lying...

02:55.776 --> 02:57.809
I paid $18 for this.

02:57.811 --> 03:01.580
I'm not sure I'd be throwing
stones, Mr. Glass Greenhouse.

03:01.582 --> 03:02.814
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

03:02.816 --> 03:03.882
That home-cooked Italian meal

03:03.884 --> 03:05.417
you made me last week?

03:05.419 --> 03:07.586
Remember that?
You know, the one

03:07.588 --> 03:09.238
you made sure I knew

03:09.239 --> 03:10.889
you meticulously sourced
and prepped for hours?

03:10.891 --> 03:12.758
That's because
I meticulously sourced it

03:12.760 --> 03:14.193
and prepped it for hours.

03:14.195 --> 03:16.295
Dude, you're a detective.

03:16.297 --> 03:17.896
If you're gonna lie to me,

03:17.898 --> 03:19.665
at least hide
the evidence better.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.400
I don't know what
you're talking about.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.835
Mamma Guido's Fast Food wrappers
in the trash?

03:23.837 --> 03:25.704
Ha! You dug through my trash.

03:25.706 --> 03:26.772
I was throwing away gum.

03:26.774 --> 03:28.340
You invaded my personal space.

03:28.342 --> 03:30.309
You-you betrayed my trust.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.344
You probably planted it there.
How dare you!

03:32.346 --> 03:35.981
Admit nothing, deny everything
and make counter-accusations.

03:35.983 --> 03:37.983
Nice try. We went to the same
interrogation classes.

03:37.985 --> 03:40.619
Gonna cost me, isn't it?

03:40.621 --> 03:43.956
Mm-hmm, and you'll never
see it coming.

03:46.293 --> 03:49.962
(clears her throat)

03:49.964 --> 03:53.899
Seems like our fellow agents
decided to sleep in today.

03:53.901 --> 03:55.634
Oh, what time is it?

03:55.636 --> 03:57.836
About an hour after
they should have been here.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.371
Wow.
I'll call Callen.

03:59.373 --> 04:00.672
I'll call Sam.

04:04.445 --> 04:06.445
Gone straight to voice mail.

04:06.447 --> 04:08.947
Sam's, too.

04:08.949 --> 04:11.016
Let's check with
Eric and Nell.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.822
I don't have to stress
that Abaq could be

04:16.824 --> 04:19.958
the most important cooperating
witness that we've encountered.

04:19.960 --> 04:23.428
Given that we weren't aware
of an ISIS cell in Los Angeles

04:23.430 --> 04:25.564
until two weeks ago,

04:25.566 --> 04:29.001
your stressing the point
is indeed redundant,

04:29.003 --> 04:30.969
Owen.

04:30.971 --> 04:35.540
Do you have any further
information on this witness?

04:35.542 --> 04:37.909
All we know about
Joseph Abaq is

04:37.911 --> 04:39.978
he's second-generation
Syrian-American.

04:39.980 --> 04:42.314
Born here, no record.

04:42.316 --> 04:44.583
Held minimum-wage jobs
since high school.

04:44.585 --> 04:47.686
So, nothing out of the ordinary?

04:47.688 --> 04:50.922
Not until he started
communicating with Omar Hubarak,

04:50.924 --> 04:51.923
the suspected
head of the cell.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.525
He's been a key player

04:53.527 --> 04:55.327
in various Middle East
Jihadist movements

04:55.329 --> 04:57.429
for the last 15 years.

04:57.431 --> 05:00.032
They think he entered the
country about six months ago.

05:00.034 --> 05:02.334
Web chatter alluded
to his forming a cell.

05:02.336 --> 05:03.902
Just didn't know
where until

05:03.904 --> 05:08.040
a traffic cam caught him on PCH.

05:08.042 --> 05:09.675
With Mr. Abaq.

05:09.677 --> 05:12.311
Is the team prepped?

05:12.312 --> 05:14.946
Mr. Callen and Mr. Hanna will be
backup when you meet with Abaq

05:14.948 --> 05:16.415
this afternoon.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.749
What about Kensi and Deeks?

05:17.751 --> 05:21.787
Ms. Blye as a waitress,
Mr. Deeks in the kitchen.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.755
Deeks is cooking?

05:23.757 --> 05:25.824
Well, it's a Mexican
restaurant, Owen.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.393
It's not, uh,
the French Laundry.

05:29.763 --> 05:32.497
Besides, I don't think you give
Mr. Deeks enough credit.

05:32.499 --> 05:35.033
His Swedish nachos

05:35.035 --> 05:37.969
were the hit
of the holiday party.

05:37.971 --> 05:40.038
I didn't get my invitation.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.374
(footsteps approaching)

05:44.111 --> 05:45.977
I take it this isn't good.

05:45.979 --> 05:48.613
Callen and and Sam haven't
shown up for work yet.

05:48.615 --> 05:50.916
DEEKS: Their, uh, cells are
going straight to voicemail,

05:50.918 --> 05:52.484
and they're not
responding to texts.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.386
They were following
up on a tip

05:54.388 --> 05:56.121
about a possible
missing NSA analyst.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.956
Worst of all,
their GPS trackers

05:57.958 --> 06:00.992
have been shut off.

06:00.994 --> 06:03.061
(squeaking)

06:06.700 --> 06:08.700
(groans quietly)

06:08.702 --> 06:11.737
(groans)

06:18.112 --> 06:20.379
(grunts softly)

06:22.116 --> 06:24.082
You okay?

06:24.084 --> 06:28.387
It depends
on your definition of "okay."

06:28.389 --> 06:30.122
(groans, sighs)

06:31.091 --> 06:33.091
(groans)

06:33.093 --> 06:36.395
Where are we?

06:36.397 --> 06:39.831
CALLEN: Looks like a machinery
room or something.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.140
(groans)

06:51.011 --> 06:53.111
A flashbang,
some smoke grenade.

06:53.113 --> 06:55.113
And tranquilizer darts
to knock us out.

07:04.558 --> 07:06.024
(banging)

07:06.026 --> 07:08.126
Solid steel.

07:09.730 --> 07:10.796
(grunts quietly)

07:12.966 --> 07:15.901
Looks like they welded
metal plates over the windows.

07:15.903 --> 07:18.170
Whoever put us in here went
through a lot of trouble

07:18.172 --> 07:19.905
to make sure we didn't get out.

07:19.907 --> 07:22.641
(fan whirring)

07:30.684 --> 07:32.751
Fresh air.

07:34.721 --> 07:37.589
At least they're trying
to keep us alive.

07:37.591 --> 07:40.625
Until they start
pumping something else in here.

08:05.118 --> 08:07.686
When was the last time
anyone spoke with them?

08:07.688 --> 08:09.288
ERIC:
Well,

08:09.289 --> 08:10.889
we were the last ones
to leave yesterday.
Yeah.

08:10.891 --> 08:12.724
Um, Sam said he
was headed home

08:12.726 --> 08:14.593
to watch a documentary
about Buzkashi,

08:14.595 --> 08:16.094
the national sport
of Afghanistan.

08:16.096 --> 08:18.129
At which point Callen
made a snarky comment

08:18.131 --> 08:20.165
about knowing what to
get him for his birthday.

08:20.167 --> 08:23.034
So, nothing unusual.

08:23.036 --> 08:25.570
No, nothing, uh, revelatory
about the conversation.

08:25.572 --> 08:28.607
I mean, about
the situation, that is.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.909
For me, myself,
I was amazed to learn

08:30.911 --> 08:34.813
that Buzkashi is actually
almost exactly like polo,

08:34.815 --> 08:35.914
except for,
instead of a ball,

08:35.916 --> 08:38.267
the players drag

08:38.268 --> 08:40.619
the decapitated corpse of a goat
across the goal line to score.

08:40.621 --> 08:42.988
(clears throat)
ERIC: I mean, I'm sorry.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.990
I didn't mean to make light
of the situation-- it's just,

08:44.992 --> 08:46.291
I'm a little worried.

08:46.293 --> 08:48.827
So, what do we know
about the NSA tip

08:48.829 --> 08:50.095
that they were following up on?

08:50.097 --> 08:51.530
Well, it's pretty vague.

08:51.532 --> 08:53.131
We received
an anonymous phone call

08:53.133 --> 08:54.699
early this morning
regarding the possible

08:54.701 --> 08:55.901
disappearance
of an analyst.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.202
ERIC:
They were supposed to meet

08:57.204 --> 08:58.837
the anonymous tipster here

08:58.839 --> 09:02.240
at a dirt road off
Bouquet Canyon in Santa Clarita.

09:02.242 --> 09:05.143
NELL: Which is where the last
readable GPS signal puts them.

09:05.145 --> 09:07.979
Where did the anonymous
phone call come from?

09:07.981 --> 09:08.980
A burn phone.

09:08.982 --> 09:10.615
Yeah, I'm guessing
we don't have

09:10.616 --> 09:12.249
a lot of video support out there
in Hooterville, either.

09:12.252 --> 09:15.954
Nearest security or traffic cams
are at least three miles out.

09:15.956 --> 09:20.325
Mr. Deeks, Ms. Blye,
I think you know your brief.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.594
Yeah.
Yeah.

09:25.766 --> 09:29.334
(sighs)

09:29.336 --> 09:32.003
You think there really was
a missing NSA analyst,

09:32.005 --> 09:33.638
or it was just a lure?

09:33.640 --> 09:35.173
I have no idea.

09:35.175 --> 09:37.642
You piss anyone off recently?

09:37.644 --> 09:39.778
(chuckles)
Just Michelle.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.313
Oh, yeah?
What was it this time--

09:41.315 --> 09:42.347
the garbage or the dishes?

09:42.349 --> 09:44.282
It doesn't matter.

09:44.284 --> 09:45.850
I don't think
she's the one who kidnapped us.

09:45.852 --> 09:47.852
I don't know
about that, Sam.

09:47.854 --> 09:50.322
You said yourself, she's
been known overreact
once in a while.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.025
You finished being ridiculous?

09:54.027 --> 09:55.293
I could be.

09:55.295 --> 09:58.363
Take a look at this.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.269
Access panel.

10:06.673 --> 10:08.206
Nice flat heads, look new.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.308
Yeah.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.711
We need something metal
with a flat edge,

10:12.713 --> 10:14.779
to use as a screwdriver.

10:28.829 --> 10:31.096
CALLEN:
Tool bag.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.202
(grunting with effort)

10:42.242 --> 10:44.909
It's a good thing one of us
isn't into pumping iron.

10:44.911 --> 10:46.978
(grunting)

10:52.986 --> 10:54.352
It's a good thing
one of us

10:54.354 --> 10:56.321
<i> is</i> into pumping iron.

10:58.358 --> 10:59.958
Got it?

10:59.960 --> 11:02.827
(grunts)
Now I do.

11:07.401 --> 11:08.933
Here.

11:12.806 --> 11:13.872
Give me that...

11:16.943 --> 11:19.010
(grunts)

11:23.750 --> 11:26.017
(grunts)

11:26.019 --> 11:28.687
Looks like a tunnel
of some sort.

11:29.456 --> 11:32.123
Tunnel?

11:34.094 --> 11:35.760
Yeah.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.098
(grunts)

11:48.308 --> 11:50.308
It was probably used
to transport material in

11:50.310 --> 11:52.711
from the outside.

11:57.317 --> 11:58.450
You all right?

11:58.452 --> 12:00.218
Let's just
keep moving.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.353
This kind of reminds me
of that Steve McQueen movie,

12:02.355 --> 12:04.889
<i>The Great Escape.</i>

12:04.891 --> 12:07.358
Is that your idea of
making me feel better?

12:07.360 --> 12:09.427
I'm just saying,
in the end, they all m...

12:09.429 --> 12:11.730
they all made it
to freedom.

12:11.732 --> 12:14.132
Not before Charles Bronson
had a panic attack

12:14.134 --> 12:15.800
when the tunnel caved in.

12:15.802 --> 12:17.435
Let's forget that part.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.437
Let's just change
the subject.
All right.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.439
Why don't you tell me what
you want for your birthday, huh?

12:21.441 --> 12:23.908
To get the hell
out of this tunnel.
All right. We can do that.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.977
How 'bout we just
not talk. At all.

12:25.979 --> 12:29.247
We can do that, too. Okay.
(sighs)

12:29.249 --> 12:31.082
(grunts)

12:31.084 --> 12:33.084
Piece of wood.

12:33.086 --> 12:36.354
Looks like that's
just wedged in there.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.442
(groans)

12:59.012 --> 13:02.480
Looks like it's screwed
into the wall from the inside.

13:02.482 --> 13:04.382
So that's good.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.518
Yeah. Give me the screwdriver.

13:06.520 --> 13:09.387
Come on.

13:09.389 --> 13:12.090
You didn't bring
the screwdriver.
How was I supposed to know

13:12.092 --> 13:13.558
we were gonna need
the screwdriver again?

13:13.560 --> 13:15.493
It's called thinking ahead.
That's what we do.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.162
You could've brought
the screwdriver.

13:17.164 --> 13:19.197
You had it last.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.099
Would you like to go get
the screwdriver?

13:21.101 --> 13:22.400
No.
Would you like
me to get it?

13:22.402 --> 13:23.401
Yes.

13:23.403 --> 13:25.303
Are you irritated?
A little.

13:25.304 --> 13:27.204
But mostly I want you to just
get the damn screwdriver.

13:27.207 --> 13:28.473
I'm gonna get the screwdriver.

13:30.944 --> 13:32.310
(car doors shut)

13:44.457 --> 13:45.590
Clear.

13:45.592 --> 13:48.159
Yeah.

13:55.068 --> 13:57.569
Fresh tire tracks.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.574
Looks like the only ones around.

14:02.576 --> 14:04.576
They look big.

14:04.578 --> 14:07.512
Maybe a pickup truck, SUV...

14:08.448 --> 14:10.949
There's no signs
of a struggle.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.283
Car wasn't tossed.

14:12.285 --> 14:13.952
It's also a big wide open space.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.954
No chance for surprises.

14:15.956 --> 14:18.323
So maybe we're talking
about numbers.

14:18.325 --> 14:21.326
I'll keep
looking.
Yeah.

14:21.328 --> 14:22.994
NELL:
Hey, Kens.

14:22.996 --> 14:25.630
Hey, Nell, I just sent you
a photo of tire tracks.

14:25.632 --> 14:27.498
See if you can narrow down
the make and model.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.200
On it.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.336
Thank you.
Kensilina.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.605
Yes.

14:33.607 --> 14:35.573
I got some good news
and some bad news.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.914
Smoke grenade.

14:44.451 --> 14:47.051
Let's keep searching.

14:47.053 --> 14:49.120
(sighs)

14:55.395 --> 14:57.262
Hey.

14:57.264 --> 14:58.429
What's that?

14:58.431 --> 15:00.665
I got a tranquilizer dart.

15:04.271 --> 15:06.404
And a flashbang fuse.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.406
(grunts)

15:08.408 --> 15:10.074
All right.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.911
Flashbang, smoke, ketamine.

15:12.913 --> 15:14.913
That's how they took 'em out.

15:14.915 --> 15:17.148
So they just wanted 'em
incapacitated.

15:17.150 --> 15:18.583
"Just"?

15:18.585 --> 15:20.919
It's better
than finding bloodstains.

15:27.494 --> 15:29.627
There was evidence
of a flashbang

15:29.629 --> 15:31.629
and a ketamine dart

15:31.631 --> 15:34.499
at Sam and Callen's
last location.

15:34.501 --> 15:37.101
Any chance
someone saw something?
The area

15:37.103 --> 15:38.937
is isolated.

15:38.939 --> 15:41.339
Which I'm sure
is why it was chosen

15:41.341 --> 15:42.674
as the meeting point.

15:42.676 --> 15:44.509
It's also one hell
of a coincidence

15:44.511 --> 15:46.377
on the day of a crucial op

15:46.379 --> 15:48.613
with our first ISIS informant,
you know?

15:48.615 --> 15:53.484
I agree. The timing raises
at least a yellow flag.

15:53.486 --> 15:58.423
I've reached out to NSA
regarding their missing analyst.

15:58.425 --> 16:01.359
See if they've heard any chatter
on the Jihadist Web sites

16:01.361 --> 16:03.261
about Hubarak or Abaq.

16:03.263 --> 16:04.996
Ahead of you, Owen.

16:04.998 --> 16:07.098
You always are, Henrietta.

16:14.374 --> 16:17.375
Listen, I'm as concerned
about them as you are.

16:17.377 --> 16:20.445
But this meeting with Abaq
must go on as planned.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.215
Understood.

16:26.486 --> 16:29.487
(grunts)
And we're out.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.022
What'd I tell you?

16:31.024 --> 16:32.557
Just like<i> The Great Escape.</i>

16:32.559 --> 16:34.492
Did you even
watch that movie?

16:34.494 --> 16:37.528
Half of the guys got shot<i> after</i>
they got out of the tunnel.

16:37.530 --> 16:38.663
Well, the other half
made it.

16:38.665 --> 16:42.133
Guess I'm a bright-side
kind of guy.

16:42.135 --> 16:44.068
Don't see any
security cams.

16:44.070 --> 16:46.537
There weren't any
inside either.

16:46.539 --> 16:49.207
Where are we?

16:49.209 --> 16:51.476
It's the wrong topography
to be...

16:51.478 --> 16:56.080
Angeles Crest or La Cañada.

16:56.082 --> 16:58.249
Definitely not
Central Los Angeles.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.752
There'd be houses
on those hills.
Deep

17:00.754 --> 17:02.653
in Topanga? Malibu, maybe?

17:02.655 --> 17:05.289
Santa Clarita Valley?

17:05.291 --> 17:07.291
So who the hell's
behind this, huh?

17:07.293 --> 17:09.427
What do they want?

17:10.463 --> 17:13.798
Could be as simple as payback
from someone we busted.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.733
It feels bigger than that.

17:15.735 --> 17:18.202
The way they took us out.

17:19.139 --> 17:21.773
Well planned, well executed.

17:21.775 --> 17:24.142
That room they
kept us in.

17:24.144 --> 17:27.211
Spent a lot
of time and money.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.383
And then there's this.

17:34.521 --> 17:36.254
What is that,
eight feet high?

17:36.256 --> 17:38.256
No barbed wire.

17:38.258 --> 17:41.059
It's almost too easy.

17:44.097 --> 17:45.663
Because it is.

17:54.841 --> 17:57.208
Plan B?

17:58.178 --> 18:00.611
MAN:
Stop!

18:00.613 --> 18:03.448
One more step
and you're a dead man.

18:20.500 --> 18:23.167
Your leg is brushing up
against a fishing line.

18:23.169 --> 18:24.235
You see it?

18:25.405 --> 18:27.205
It's
a trip wire.

18:27.207 --> 18:30.875
SAM:
He's right, G.
Don't move.

18:30.877 --> 18:33.177
Not moving.

18:33.179 --> 18:35.746
I saw one like it
back there.

18:35.748 --> 18:38.282
It's attached to a spring-loaded
device that releases a board

18:38.284 --> 18:41.419
embedded with nails in it,
striking chest high.

18:41.421 --> 18:42.687
Into the heart.

18:42.689 --> 18:45.189
Okay.

18:45.191 --> 18:46.591
Here's what we're gonna do.

18:46.593 --> 18:47.592
I'm all ears.

18:47.594 --> 18:49.444
On the count
of three,

18:49.445 --> 18:51.295
you're gonna drop to the ground
as fast as you can.

18:51.297 --> 18:52.296
I can do fast.

18:52.298 --> 18:53.297
You ready?

18:53.299 --> 18:54.832
One, two...

19:05.645 --> 19:08.212
Thanks.

19:08.214 --> 19:09.347
Who are you?

19:09.349 --> 19:11.549
Martin Samir, NSA.
Whoa!

19:11.551 --> 19:14.218
Don't move.

19:14.220 --> 19:16.287
Don't move.

19:28.368 --> 19:29.901
Who are you guys?

19:31.337 --> 19:33.638
Agents Hanna and Callen, NCIS.

19:33.640 --> 19:36.157
It's a hell of a way
to say hello.

19:36.158 --> 19:38.675
Insurgent analyst for ten years.
You know what to look for.

19:38.678 --> 19:39.710
Thank you.

19:39.712 --> 19:40.811
No problem.

19:40.813 --> 19:42.346
We got a tip this morning

19:42.348 --> 19:44.682
about a missing NSA analyst.

19:44.684 --> 19:45.683
Guess that's me.

19:45.685 --> 19:46.918
It was a setup to kidnap us.

19:46.920 --> 19:49.854
They grabbed me near the office
this morning.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.589
Went out for a Starbucks.

19:51.591 --> 19:54.759
Any surveillance?
Traffic cams? Anything?

19:54.761 --> 19:56.827
I doubt it.
It was a side street.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.629
They must have been tailing me.

19:58.631 --> 19:59.964
When you left NSA,

19:59.966 --> 20:02.433
where'd you exit
the garage from?

20:02.435 --> 20:03.901
The main exit on Wilshire,

20:03.903 --> 20:05.436
drove towards Western.

20:05.438 --> 20:07.572
Traffic cams on Wilshire
probably picked 'em up.

20:07.574 --> 20:09.740
What's with the cuffs?

20:09.742 --> 20:13.277
I-I woke up out here,
cuffed to a metal pipe.

20:13.279 --> 20:15.713
Took a while,
but I managed to get free.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.548
You guys?

20:17.550 --> 20:19.550
Locked room. Found a way out.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.752
They probably didn't want us
talking to each other.

20:21.754 --> 20:24.488
You have any idea
who "they" are?

20:24.490 --> 20:26.490
I heard a little chatter
before I passed out.

20:26.492 --> 20:27.792
Pretty sure it's ISIS.

20:27.794 --> 20:30.261
Omar Hubarak?

20:30.263 --> 20:31.662
And Joseph Abaq.

20:32.932 --> 20:35.666
What do you people know
about Abaq?

20:35.668 --> 20:38.669
We've been trying to track him
for the past few months.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.972
As far as we can tell,
he's an associate

20:40.974 --> 20:43.641
of the cell
that Hubarak leads, here in L.A.

20:43.643 --> 20:46.577
There's rumors he's a traitor,
feeding intel to the Feds.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.579
SAM:
Rumors?

20:48.581 --> 20:50.748
Unsubstantiated.

20:50.750 --> 20:51.949
We don't believe it.

20:51.951 --> 20:54.285
We think Hubarak has
something big planned,

20:54.287 --> 20:56.554
to make a statement,
and it involves Abaq.

20:56.556 --> 20:58.623
But we're not
sure what it is.

21:00.326 --> 21:02.460
Another fine mess, G.

21:06.833 --> 21:10.768
Let's see if we can find a break
in the fence somewhere.

21:13.273 --> 21:15.640
NELL (sighs): Well...
the tires are a no-brainer.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.742
They're on several Ford trucks

21:17.744 --> 21:19.577
from 1990 to 2006.

21:19.579 --> 21:21.579
And how many trucks
is that total?

21:21.581 --> 21:23.047
Oh, just
a few thousand

21:23.049 --> 21:24.849
in the L.A. area alone.
Great.

21:24.851 --> 21:26.550
ERIC:
On the better news side,

21:26.552 --> 21:28.586
your flashbang
and smoke grenade

21:28.588 --> 21:30.955
were part of a cache of
weapons and equipment

21:30.957 --> 21:32.590
from a National Guard

21:32.592 --> 21:34.825
transport truck
hijacked last month.

21:34.827 --> 21:37.628
That's a bold move.
It's a big payoff.

21:37.630 --> 21:41.032
ERIC:
LAPD has two suspects
from Armenian Power in custody.

21:41.034 --> 21:44.035
ATF narrowed the list
of potential buyers.

21:44.037 --> 21:47.838
Uh, number one candidate
is a low-level arms dealer,

21:47.840 --> 21:49.774
one Oscar Willits.

21:49.776 --> 21:51.609
Okay, so Willits
is the middleman.

21:51.611 --> 21:54.812
He's legitimately incorporated
as Oscar Willits Limited,

21:54.814 --> 21:57.815
a business management
consulting firm.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.717
Oh, you're kidding me--
that's his cover?

21:59.719 --> 22:00.718
Yep.

22:00.720 --> 22:01.986
And that's his office.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.487
DEEKS: Wow. That's
the very definition

22:03.489 --> 22:05.723
of "limited."

22:05.725 --> 22:07.725
And it's in Santa Clarita,
three miles from where

22:07.727 --> 22:08.826
Callen and Sam were taken.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.762
DEEKS: So who's
his clients,

22:10.763 --> 22:12.697
rattlesnakes and the whole cast
of<i> Honey Boo Boo?</i>

22:12.699 --> 22:17.468
NSA has just confirmed
they have a missing analyst.

22:17.470 --> 22:20.371
Martin Samir.

22:20.373 --> 22:22.673
Ms. Blye, Mr. Deeks,

22:22.675 --> 22:25.676
I suggest you go and get
some management advice,

22:25.678 --> 22:27.778
ASAP.

22:27.780 --> 22:29.747
(groans)
Never hurts.

22:29.749 --> 22:32.483
Abaq is meeting with our
assistant director at 3:00.

22:32.485 --> 22:34.051
Lucy's El Adobe.

22:34.053 --> 22:35.786
It's got to be a setup.

22:35.788 --> 22:38.122
Killing him would make
for a public relations coup.

22:38.124 --> 22:42.026
We need to find a way
to get in touch with Granger.

22:59.011 --> 23:00.845
(knocking)

23:03.649 --> 23:04.815
It's locked.

23:04.817 --> 23:06.117
Over there.

23:08.054 --> 23:09.920
Well, no way
he doesn't see us coming.

23:09.922 --> 23:11.122
Mm.

23:12.892 --> 23:15.393
I just got my
car washed.

23:15.395 --> 23:18.662
Now I'm gonna have
to barrel it across
a dirt road and...

23:18.664 --> 23:22.533
This is your clever way
of saying that I'll be the one
heading him off on foot?

23:22.535 --> 23:24.802
I think Mama Guido said it best.

23:24.804 --> 23:27.138
Huh. Touché.
(laughs)

23:31.644 --> 23:34.512
Hey, Mr. Willits.
What do you want?

23:34.514 --> 23:37.615
I just came to get some advice
about my business.

23:37.617 --> 23:39.784
You'll have to make
an appointment.

23:39.786 --> 23:41.786
Make an appointment?
I just drove all
the way out here.

23:41.788 --> 23:43.754
We can't talk now?
It's not gonna
take that long.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.489
Go away.

23:45.491 --> 23:48.492
Here's the deal--
I do import-export,
mostly okra,

23:48.494 --> 23:49.994
but I'm trying to get into
more high-end vegetables,

23:49.996 --> 23:51.028
like kumquats
and fiddleheads.

23:51.030 --> 23:52.997
DEEKS:
Don't... Federal agents!

23:54.767 --> 23:56.500
Freeze!

23:56.502 --> 23:58.035
No, n-not in
the water.

23:58.037 --> 24:00.104
That looks incredibly cold.

24:11.117 --> 24:12.516
(grunts)

24:13.119 --> 24:15.753
Aah! Oh, God, that's cold!

24:15.755 --> 24:17.655
What are you doing?

24:17.657 --> 24:19.123
Where are you going?

24:19.125 --> 24:20.758
What-what is your plan here,

24:20.760 --> 24:23.060
that I'm gonna slip
and knock myself unconscious?

24:23.062 --> 24:24.462
Kensi, shoot him.

24:25.064 --> 24:26.697
Willits!

24:27.500 --> 24:29.200
(grunts)

24:29.202 --> 24:31.202
Get up.

24:31.204 --> 24:33.070
Done?
KENSI: Federal agents.

24:33.072 --> 24:35.206
Stop struggling, Willits.

24:35.208 --> 24:36.807
(grunting)

24:36.809 --> 24:39.009
It's over, man.

24:40.913 --> 24:42.947
Just for the record...

24:42.949 --> 24:45.516
you licked that Mama
Guido plate clean.

24:48.221 --> 24:50.788
We'll give you
our full cooperation

24:50.790 --> 24:54.258
so we can work together
and find our people.

24:55.895 --> 24:57.962
HETTY:
Thank you.

24:57.964 --> 24:59.897
You find anything?

25:04.136 --> 25:08.973
Mr. Samir never showed up
for work this morning.

25:08.975 --> 25:11.809
An NSA team swept
his apartment

25:11.811 --> 25:14.879
and found signs
of a struggle.

25:27.293 --> 25:30.027
(sighs) So what's
our next move?

25:30.029 --> 25:32.863
That was gonna be
my question to you.

25:32.865 --> 25:35.599
If you guys don't mind,
uh, nature calls.

25:56.088 --> 25:58.222
¶ ¶

26:22.081 --> 26:23.681
SAM:
Samir!

26:23.683 --> 26:25.683
Yeah. I'm a little
preoccupied here.

26:25.685 --> 26:28.018
Talked it over
with my partner.

26:28.020 --> 26:29.320
We think the best plan

26:29.322 --> 26:31.021
is to break back
into the building,

26:31.023 --> 26:34.992
find ourselves a way
to cut the power to the fence.

26:35.962 --> 26:38.028
All right.

26:38.030 --> 26:39.730
Ready to roll?

26:43.869 --> 26:46.103
I'm coming, I'm coming.

26:50.343 --> 26:51.842
I already told you,

26:51.844 --> 26:53.777
I'm a business management
consultant.

26:53.779 --> 26:55.245
Hmm. Well,
putting aside the fact

26:55.247 --> 26:57.281
you're operating your business
out in Green Acres,

26:57.283 --> 27:00.217
not a lot of consultants
run away from potential clients.

27:00.219 --> 27:02.353
Especially
through a lake.

27:02.355 --> 27:03.954
I'm always wary of strangers.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.923
It's one of the many
pearls or wisdom

27:05.925 --> 27:08.859
I like to pass on to the people
I do business with.

27:08.861 --> 27:11.862
Oh, especially the
ones that you sell stolen
explosives and weapons to.

27:11.864 --> 27:13.297
That's not true.

27:13.299 --> 27:15.099
Isn't it?

27:15.101 --> 27:18.068
Look, I know I don't look
like your everyday consultant.

27:18.070 --> 27:21.071
That's what makes me unique.
DEEKS: No, no, what
makes you unique,

27:21.073 --> 27:25.409
Oscar, is the, uh, dozen AR-15s,
5,000 rounds of ammo,

27:25.411 --> 27:27.311
and another dozen
stolen flashbang grenades

27:27.313 --> 27:30.648
that were found in a shed next
to your corporate headquarters.

27:30.650 --> 27:33.050
Not a lot of that
happening at AIG.

27:33.052 --> 27:35.986
Explosives that were
used in the abduction
of two Federal agents.

27:37.790 --> 27:40.357
I have no idea
how those got there.

27:40.359 --> 27:43.227
DEEKS: Hm. You know what,
despite the fact that

27:43.229 --> 27:45.829
our partners could be
in serious trouble
because of you,

27:45.831 --> 27:49.299
it is... it is a new year.

27:49.301 --> 27:50.901
Know what I mean?
And I am a...

27:50.903 --> 27:54.371
firm believer that everyone
deserves a fresh start.

27:56.242 --> 27:57.274
He gets like this
sometimes.

27:57.276 --> 27:58.709
DEEKS:
I have an inkling

27:58.711 --> 28:00.110
just to let you go.

28:00.112 --> 28:02.196
Know what I mean?

28:02.197 --> 28:04.281
Just avoid that pesky
30 years in prison.

28:05.418 --> 28:07.718
You do?

28:07.719 --> 28:10.019
Yeah. Drop you off at the corner
of Florence and Inglewood...

28:10.022 --> 28:13.190
while a major drug bust is
going down, pat you on the back

28:13.192 --> 28:16.160
and say, "Thanks
for all your help."
That should be enough

28:16.162 --> 28:18.395
to get the attention of
the local Neighborhood Watch,

28:18.397 --> 28:20.331
don't you think?

28:20.332 --> 28:22.266
Well, we can't forget
the $200 informant fee

28:22.268 --> 28:24.334
Right.
that we would
count out slowly

28:24.336 --> 28:26.136
in front of the MS-13
youth league.

28:26.138 --> 28:27.337
That's if
you're a fan

28:27.339 --> 28:29.139
of fresh starts.

28:29.141 --> 28:31.041
Are you, Oscar?

28:32.011 --> 28:34.244
But if not, you
should probably

28:34.246 --> 28:36.313
go ahead and drop
one of those little, uh...

28:36.315 --> 28:39.316
pearls of wisdom on us
and let us know who it is

28:39.318 --> 28:42.052
you sold those stolen
flashbang grenades to.

28:42.054 --> 28:45.089
That would work, too.

28:58.304 --> 29:01.004
Check out the windows on
the front half of the building.

29:01.006 --> 29:03.273
It doesn't look like
they're covered with anything.

29:03.275 --> 29:05.008
Must be a
separate room.

29:05.010 --> 29:08.045
That's probably where
our guys set up shop.

29:08.047 --> 29:09.313
They could still be in there.

29:09.315 --> 29:11.815
If they are,
they're gonna be armed.

29:11.817 --> 29:13.183
You up for this?

29:13.185 --> 29:15.085
I may be an analyst,
but I can handle myself.

29:16.956 --> 29:20.023
We use that smaller building
as cover.

29:20.025 --> 29:22.493
Make it harder for them
to see us coming.

29:22.495 --> 29:25.362
We get closer,
we'll decide the best way in.

29:25.364 --> 29:27.431
We'll take the lead on this.

29:27.433 --> 29:28.866
You stick close.

29:28.868 --> 29:30.334
Got it.

29:33.372 --> 29:35.422
Anything?

29:35.423 --> 29:37.473
I think we found the truck
that matches the description

29:37.476 --> 29:39.510
that Oscar Willits
gave you.

29:39.512 --> 29:43.180
Dually crew cab,
wood rack, brush guard,

29:43.182 --> 29:45.883
white paint scrapes on
the right front fender.

29:45.885 --> 29:47.217
Zoom in on the cab.

29:47.219 --> 29:49.153
Yeah.

29:49.155 --> 29:51.522
Can you get closer
to the passenger?
Mm-hmm.

29:53.225 --> 29:54.391
Can you clean that up?

29:54.393 --> 29:57.327
Sure.

29:57.329 --> 29:58.562
There it is.

29:58.564 --> 30:01.064
Tranq gun.
DEEKS: When and where?

30:01.066 --> 30:02.266
Half an hour
before Callen and Sam

30:02.268 --> 30:03.801
were supposed
to meet their tip guy,

30:03.802 --> 30:05.335
five miles
from the meeting spot.
We already called it in

30:05.337 --> 30:07.070
to the Highway Patrol.
Now we're going through

30:07.072 --> 30:08.572
traffic-cam footage
to see if we can

30:08.574 --> 30:10.007
find a more
recent hit.

30:10.009 --> 30:11.241
(beeping)

30:11.243 --> 30:13.343
Oh. Got it.

30:13.345 --> 30:16.580
This is 45 minutes ago,
off Old Topanga.
DEEKS: Nice.

30:16.582 --> 30:18.315
Perfect. Let's go.

30:23.422 --> 30:26.089
Where are you going?
Eric got a hit

30:26.091 --> 30:27.491
on the kidnappers' truck.
We have an op

30:27.493 --> 30:29.193
in 45 minutes.
Yeah, what we have

30:29.195 --> 30:30.961
is Callen and Sam
in trouble.

30:30.963 --> 30:32.863
I'll assign another team
to the truck lead.

30:32.865 --> 30:34.898
Another tea...
No, with all due respect, sir...

30:34.900 --> 30:36.033
Listen to me.

30:36.035 --> 30:37.568
This has nothing to do
with respect.

30:37.570 --> 30:39.903
I know what you're feeling
about Callen and Sam.

30:39.905 --> 30:42.606
Whether you want to believe it
or not, I feel the same way.

30:43.909 --> 30:45.042
But this is a chance

30:45.044 --> 30:46.577
to take down the only known

30:46.579 --> 30:48.478
ISIS cell in the country,

30:48.480 --> 30:50.414
and you're prepped for the op.

30:52.451 --> 30:53.984
I need you.

31:08.133 --> 31:10.400
¶ ¶

31:28.187 --> 31:30.387
We need to break it
fast and get in.

31:33.893 --> 31:36.426
I told you,
we'll take point on this.

31:50.109 --> 31:51.642
(grunts)

32:04.523 --> 32:07.691
He's been in there
too long.

32:09.194 --> 32:10.928
All clear.

32:15.534 --> 32:18.502
We've got to find those phones.

32:18.504 --> 32:19.970
Circuit breaker.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.940
That should cut the power
to the fence.

32:22.942 --> 32:25.676
(man groans in distance)

32:26.979 --> 32:29.713
Find the phones.

32:30.983 --> 32:32.649
(man groans in distance)

32:55.307 --> 32:56.673
Who are you?

32:56.675 --> 32:59.009
(gasping)

33:02.014 --> 33:04.715
Martin Samir, NSA.

33:19.298 --> 33:21.665
¶ ¶

33:26.238 --> 33:26.737
(clears throat)

33:26.739 --> 33:28.271
Everything okay?

33:29.241 --> 33:31.775
Your cook sucks.

33:33.312 --> 33:35.145
Noted.

33:37.383 --> 33:39.649
(bell dings)
Oh, chef.

33:39.651 --> 33:42.619
Oh, waitress.

33:42.621 --> 33:45.088
Good thing there's only
three other customers in here.

33:45.090 --> 33:46.590
Mm.

33:46.592 --> 33:49.426
Apparently with
very low standards.

33:49.428 --> 33:51.150
You know what I'm going to do?

33:51.151 --> 33:52.873
I'm going make you
some homemade alphabet soup

33:52.874 --> 33:54.596
so you can eat your words
when you taste my real cooking.

34:10.749 --> 34:13.183
Good to see you, Mr. Abaq.

34:23.362 --> 34:24.728
Drop it.

34:29.168 --> 34:31.101
(gunfire continues)

34:31.103 --> 34:32.736
FAKE SAMIR:
You're too late!

34:32.738 --> 34:34.538
You gave me the meeting place!

34:34.540 --> 34:36.406
I sent word to my people!

34:36.408 --> 34:38.141
Soon your assistant director

34:38.143 --> 34:41.144
and the traitor Abaq
will be dead!

34:43.082 --> 34:44.815
ABAQ:
Thank you.

34:47.119 --> 34:49.119
(beeps)

34:49.121 --> 34:50.787
Shall we get started?

34:52.591 --> 34:53.857
You're sure we're safe here?

34:53.859 --> 34:57.294
I assure you,
you're in no danger.

34:57.296 --> 35:00.597
The cell has ten core members

35:00.599 --> 35:03.133
plus associates.

35:03.135 --> 35:05.368
(tires screeching)
Almost all Syrian and Iraqi.

35:05.370 --> 35:07.337
Most were born here.

35:13.679 --> 35:15.178
(gun clicking)

35:16.348 --> 35:18.381
(guns clicking)

35:24.556 --> 35:26.423
Get back!

35:42.241 --> 35:44.674
Afraid I got some bad news
for you.

35:44.676 --> 35:47.878
We knew you weren't real
ten minutes after we met you.

35:47.880 --> 35:52.149
Location I gave you for
the Abaq meeting was wrong.

35:52.151 --> 35:54.417
I informed NCIS.

35:55.387 --> 35:57.387
Your buddies from ISIS

35:57.389 --> 36:00.457
are about to get surrounded
by an army of Feds.

36:09.568 --> 36:11.701
(tires screeching)
Federal agents!
Drop your weapons!

36:12.771 --> 36:14.704
(grunts)

36:20.946 --> 36:22.479
(grunts)

36:23.448 --> 36:25.549
(gunfire)

36:34.626 --> 36:35.792
(grunts)

36:42.968 --> 36:44.768
(grunts)

36:44.770 --> 36:46.536
I said halt!
Clear!

36:46.538 --> 36:48.238
All clear!

36:51.376 --> 36:53.276
Well, that's

36:53.278 --> 36:55.612
six less ISIS cell members
we have to worry about.

36:55.614 --> 36:56.846
I just hope that

36:56.848 --> 36:59.783
Mr. Callen and Mr. Hanna
have a plan

36:59.785 --> 37:02.219
to save themselves.

37:11.797 --> 37:12.996
He's running!

37:18.303 --> 37:20.403
Here.

37:29.348 --> 37:30.513
There he is.

37:39.758 --> 37:42.692
CALLEN:
We're not going to catch him.

37:43.662 --> 37:45.595
We don't have to.

38:02.347 --> 38:04.281
(screams)

38:21.933 --> 38:24.000
(camera clicks)

38:26.338 --> 38:28.672
ERIC:
His name is Jamal Nezi.

38:28.674 --> 38:30.440
An active jihadist for al-Qaeda

38:30.442 --> 38:32.809
until their organization
started to unravel.

38:32.811 --> 38:35.545
When ISIS reinvigorated
the jihadist movement,

38:35.547 --> 38:38.315
it provided a new
opportunity for Nezi.

38:38.317 --> 38:40.717
According to intelligence
reports, the ISIS cell in L.A.

38:40.719 --> 38:43.353
suspected Abaq
of talking to NCIS.

38:43.355 --> 38:47.524
But Mr. Abaq was in the
proverbial wind by that point.

38:47.526 --> 38:49.592
Okay, so they hatched up a plan.

38:49.594 --> 38:52.896
They kidnap Callen
and Sam and...

38:52.898 --> 38:55.732
make them think an NSA agent
is a fellow captive?

38:55.734 --> 38:59.369
Hoping that they'll give up
intel freely on Abaq.

38:59.371 --> 39:02.505
But they didn't count on Sam's
knowledge of the NSA building.

39:02.507 --> 39:03.773
KENSI:
Yes!

39:03.775 --> 39:05.041
SAM:
Yeah.

39:05.043 --> 39:06.810
It's good to have you two back.

39:06.812 --> 39:08.445
Oh, it is good to be back.

39:08.447 --> 39:11.081
Ooh, speaking of which,
I have a... I have a surprise.

39:11.083 --> 39:12.549
KENSI:
Um...

39:12.551 --> 39:14.384
so what tipped you off?
SAM: Ah.

39:14.386 --> 39:16.419
A couple of weeks ago,
I was at the NSA.

39:16.421 --> 39:18.521
They're doing construction
on the garage.

39:18.523 --> 39:21.358
The Wilshire exit will be
blocked for the next six weeks.

39:21.360 --> 39:23.360
Nezi told us that he exited
the garage on Wilshire

39:23.362 --> 39:24.661
before he was taken.

39:24.663 --> 39:26.763
Sam knew his cover was bogus.

39:28.100 --> 39:29.933
<i>When I broke into the building,</i>
<i> I was able to find</i>

39:29.935 --> 39:31.768
<i> our weapons and my cell phone,</i>
<i> so I texted Ops</i>

39:31.770 --> 39:33.803
<i> the location</i>
<i> of the phony meeting</i>

39:33.805 --> 39:35.038
<i> that we told Nezi about.</i>

39:36.808 --> 39:38.742
Which reminds me. Uh...

39:38.744 --> 39:40.477
"Another fine mess"?

39:40.479 --> 39:42.712
Think maybe we could come up
with a watchword

39:42.714 --> 39:43.980
a little hipper
than Laurel and Hardy?

39:43.982 --> 39:46.883
I love Laurel and Hardy.

39:46.885 --> 39:48.551
The big guy's smart.

39:48.553 --> 39:50.754
I'm with him--
I love Laurel and Hardy.

39:50.755 --> 39:52.956
The perfect thing to celebrate
your safe homecoming,

39:52.958 --> 39:54.958
my famous Swedish nachos.

39:54.960 --> 39:56.559
Go ahead, dig in.
Just take a...

39:56.561 --> 39:58.211
Oh, I'm...
Take a little bit.

39:58.212 --> 39:59.862
They're, uh,
they're gluten free.
Oh, not right now.

39:59.865 --> 40:01.131
Just...
ERIC: Thanks, but no.

40:01.133 --> 40:02.866
Um, when, um...
Do you...?

40:02.868 --> 40:06.136
So, when we
said that we...

40:06.138 --> 40:08.905
liked them, we actually

40:08.907 --> 40:10.440
meant... we were...

40:10.442 --> 40:11.808
You were just being polite?
Yeah.

40:11.810 --> 40:13.510
NELL:
Well... you worked so hard

40:13.512 --> 40:14.878
and, you know,
it was Christmas.

40:14.880 --> 40:17.647
Sorry.
And this is coming out now?

40:17.649 --> 40:18.948
What's up, Granger?

40:18.950 --> 40:21.518
Wait a minute.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.820
Swedish nachos, right?

40:23.822 --> 40:25.855
Yeah.
Nacho meatballs?

40:25.857 --> 40:27.207
Yeah.

40:27.208 --> 40:28.558
GRANGER: I missed this
the first time around,

40:28.560 --> 40:30.310
I'm not missing it
this time.

40:30.311 --> 40:32.061
I'm going to try one right now.
Get in there.

40:32.063 --> 40:35.465
(chuckling)
Uh...
Mm, mm!

40:37.869 --> 40:39.903
That's pretty good.

40:39.905 --> 40:40.937
Thank you. It's good.

40:40.939 --> 40:42.605
Finally, someone with a palate.

40:45.177 --> 40:46.843
(laughing)

40:46.845 --> 40:48.044
What?

40:48.046 --> 40:49.512
Nothing.

40:49.514 --> 40:52.882
In fact, it makes perfect sense.

40:52.884 --> 40:54.184
