Aah!

00:26.842 --> 00:30.045
♪ Good morning, USA!

00:31.280 --> 00:32.747
(brakes squeak)

00:32.782 --> 00:33.915
(door opens)

00:34.035 --> 00:35.650
Stan, what are you doing home?

00:35.685 --> 00:36.718
It's only 4:00.

00:36.752 --> 00:37.819
They all went bowling.

00:37.853 --> 00:38.920
Who did?

00:38.955 --> 00:40.322
Bullock and his Inner Circle.

00:40.356 --> 00:42.524
Well, why don't you ask to be
in the Inner Circle?

00:42.558 --> 00:43.725
I did.

00:43.759 --> 00:45.493
Sir?

00:45.528 --> 00:47.228
(wind whistling)

00:47.263 --> 00:49.664
Smith, what are you doing here?

00:49.699 --> 00:51.399
Can I be in the Inner Circle?

00:51.434 --> 00:53.335
No! And shut the door.

00:53.369 --> 00:56.972
Taxpayers are paying top dollar
for this wind.

00:57.006 --> 00:58.873
All the agents in
the Inner Circle

00:58.908 --> 01:00.642
were flying like
birds, Francine,

01:00.676 --> 01:02.877
and I was just standing
there on the ground,

01:02.912 --> 01:03.945
like a stupid mammal.

01:03.980 --> 01:06.081
Well, I don't think
you're a mammal.

01:06.115 --> 01:07.248
Morning, guys.

01:07.283 --> 01:08.817
Morning? You
better be talking

01:08.851 --> 01:10.819
about former Charlotte
Hornet Alonzo Mourning,

01:10.853 --> 01:12.153
because it's 4:00
in the afternoon.

01:12.188 --> 01:13.688
You can't possibly
just be getting up.

01:13.723 --> 01:14.823
Whatevs.

01:14.857 --> 01:17.626
Mom, hands, eggs, make.

01:17.660 --> 01:19.060
You, hold it right there.

01:19.095 --> 01:20.328
You, make your own eggs.

01:20.363 --> 01:22.564
You, stay beautiful.

01:22.598 --> 01:24.199
I don't know how to make eggs.

01:24.233 --> 01:25.834
Mom always makes my breakfast.

01:25.868 --> 01:27.168
Oh, my God.

01:27.203 --> 01:29.037
You can't make food,
you sleep all day,

01:29.071 --> 01:30.839
you barely form
complete sentences.

01:30.873 --> 01:32.273
What are you talking me at?

01:32.308 --> 01:34.109
You have no survival skills.

01:34.143 --> 01:36.111
Oh, don't be so overdramatic.

01:36.145 --> 01:38.246
Someday, we are
gonna die, Francine.

01:38.280 --> 01:39.547
You sooner than me, probably,

01:39.582 --> 01:40.915
with all that string
cheese you eat,

01:40.950 --> 01:42.884
but we're both gonna go,
and when we do,

01:42.918 --> 01:45.754
this girl right here is not
qualified to be anything

01:45.788 --> 01:47.689
other than a stripper
or a crack whore

01:47.723 --> 01:49.491
or a-a...

01:49.525 --> 01:51.192
Oh, I was sure
there was a third.

01:51.227 --> 01:55.563
Uh, stripper, crack
whore, grocery bagger?

01:55.598 --> 01:57.432
No, no, that's a
noble profession.

01:57.466 --> 01:59.034
I have plenty
of survival skills.

01:59.068 --> 02:00.935
The prove it.
Effective immediately,

02:00.970 --> 02:03.338
you are gonna start paying
rent around here, young lady.

02:03.372 --> 02:04.806
How am I supposed
to afford that?

02:04.840 --> 02:07.208
You've got survival
skills; figure it out.

02:07.243 --> 02:09.711
Go be something other than
a stripper or a crack whore

02:09.745 --> 02:11.413
or a-a... or a...

02:11.447 --> 02:13.014
Oh, God, that is so annoying.

02:13.049 --> 02:15.216
Uh, stay-at-home mom.

02:15.251 --> 02:17.552
It was right in front
of me the whole time.

02:17.586 --> 02:20.021
(rock music playing)

02:20.056 --> 02:23.324
Thanks for the bartending job,
Roger.

02:23.359 --> 02:25.493
My dad is insisting I pay rent.

02:25.528 --> 02:26.761
I don't blame him.

02:26.796 --> 02:28.496
Somebody's got to pay
for all this neon,

02:28.531 --> 02:29.831
and it's not gonna be me.

02:29.865 --> 02:32.233
All my money goes to
experimental VD treatments.

02:32.268 --> 02:34.035
Anyway, now that
you're a bartender,

02:34.070 --> 02:36.104
people are gonna share a
lot of things with you,

02:36.138 --> 02:38.506
and the better listener you are,
the better tips you'll get.

02:38.541 --> 02:39.841
Except for Carlos.

02:39.875 --> 02:41.710
He's gonna offer you a tip.

02:41.744 --> 02:42.944
You don't want that tip.

02:42.978 --> 02:44.913
That tip is connected
to his body.

02:46.248 --> 02:49.484
KLAUS: I am so excited to
share <i>Das Boot</i> with you.

02:49.518 --> 02:52.587
This is the greatest
German movie of all time.

02:52.621 --> 02:55.423
If you don't count
the Hindenburg footage.

02:55.458 --> 02:57.592
(speaking German)

02:57.626 --> 02:59.094
(chuckles)

02:59.128 --> 03:01.229
What's so funny?
They're just eating dinner.

03:01.263 --> 03:05.033
It's a reference to <i>Das Kleines</i>
<i>Madchen und Der Zwergenhafter.</i>

03:05.067 --> 03:07.368
The Little Girl
and the Little Person?

03:07.403 --> 03:08.369
No idea.

03:08.404 --> 03:09.738
What?

03:09.772 --> 03:12.240
You don't know
the famous German fairy tale

03:12.274 --> 03:14.676
The Little Girl
and the Little Person?

03:16.579 --> 03:18.146

03:19.749 --> 03:21.382
(clears throat)

03:21.417 --> 03:24.185
Once upon a time,
there was a little girl

03:24.220 --> 03:27.589
with hair as golden
as sauerkraut.

03:27.623 --> 03:30.825
Das Madchen <i>was taking</i>
<i>her beloved schnauzer</i>

03:30.860 --> 03:32.627
<i>for a walk one day,</i>

03:32.661 --> 03:34.829
<i>when she came</i>
<i>upon a little person</i>

03:34.864 --> 03:36.331
<i>toiling in the fields.</i>

03:36.365 --> 03:37.799
STEVE:
Why am I the little girl?

03:37.833 --> 03:39.434
SNOT: And why am I
the little person?

03:39.468 --> 03:41.302
KLAUS: <i>Because German kinder
do what they're told!</i>

03:41.337 --> 03:42.704
<i>Now shut up and listen!</i>

03:42.738 --> 03:45.573
<i>Suddenly, the little person</i>
<i>saw an eagle</i>

03:45.608 --> 03:47.408
<i>soaring overhead.</i>

03:47.443 --> 03:49.344
<i>Achtung,</i> an eagle.

03:49.378 --> 03:51.045
<i>The little girl cowered,</i>

03:51.080 --> 03:53.681
<i>since we all know</i>
<i>what natural sworn enemies</i>

03:53.716 --> 03:55.183
<i>schnauzers and eagles are.</i>

03:55.217 --> 03:56.918
STEVE:
<i>Wait, why schnauzers and eagles</i>

03:56.952 --> 03:58.953
<i>be natural sworn enemies?</i>

03:58.988 --> 04:00.188
What?!

04:00.222 --> 04:02.423
You don't know the
story of the schnauzer

04:02.458 --> 04:04.526
who stole the eagle's worm?

04:04.560 --> 04:07.162
Well, now I have to tell
you that story first,

04:07.196 --> 04:08.897
because you can't
get the other story

04:08.931 --> 04:10.331
without knowing this story.

04:10.366 --> 04:11.833

SNOT:
Oh, God.

04:22.378 --> 04:24.579
Stan, I know you want Hayley

04:24.613 --> 04:26.181
to learn to take care
of herself,

04:26.215 --> 04:27.949
but is Roger's bar

04:27.983 --> 04:29.818
the healthiest environment
for her?

04:29.852 --> 04:32.120
Will you go up there
and see if she's okay?

04:32.154 --> 04:33.922
Spy on Hayley? Sure.

04:33.956 --> 04:35.824
It's been years
since I've gone undercover.

04:35.858 --> 04:37.926
Let me refresh myself
on my special skills.

04:41.730 --> 04:43.431
(Jamaican accent):
Oye, dis'll be as easy

04:43.465 --> 04:46.935
as rolling a spliff
in Kingston Town, mon.

05:14.029 --> 05:16.531
(lips smacking)

05:16.565 --> 05:18.399
Good Lord, Francine is right.

05:18.434 --> 05:20.168
I can't let Hayley work here.

05:20.202 --> 05:22.537
BULLOCK: Want to know
what I really think?

05:22.571 --> 05:25.306
Agents don't have
any style anymore.

05:25.341 --> 05:29.310
If some agent today were
to have the sense of élan

05:29.345 --> 05:33.681
to walk into my office
wearing a pocket square,

05:33.716 --> 05:36.050
what I wouldn't do for that man.

05:36.085 --> 05:38.920
Maybe even let him
into the Inner Circle?

05:39.922 --> 05:41.322
I'll have another.

05:41.357 --> 05:43.157
And pour one for yourself.

05:43.192 --> 05:44.759
Sorry, on the clock.

05:44.793 --> 05:46.861
Ah, but I insist.

05:46.896 --> 05:48.897
Okay, why not?

05:50.499 --> 05:51.866
(sighs)

05:51.901 --> 05:53.534
Don't get too drunk, Avery.

05:53.569 --> 05:55.603
I know you're a guy
with a lot of secrets,

05:55.638 --> 05:57.138
and, you know, loose lips.

05:57.172 --> 05:58.439
You're my bartender.

05:58.474 --> 06:01.175
If I can't share
with you, who can I?

06:01.210 --> 06:04.579
I might even tell you
my favorite animal.

06:04.613 --> 06:05.847
I'll give you a hint.

06:05.881 --> 06:08.283
Meow.

06:09.818 --> 06:12.287
Francine, what the hell
is a pocket square?

06:12.321 --> 06:13.955
What?
It's a decorative kerchief.

06:13.989 --> 06:14.823
Who cares?

06:14.943 --> 06:15.964
How was the bar?

06:16.084 --> 06:18.173
Is Hayley gonna be okay
working up there?

06:18.293 --> 06:19.794
Huh? Oh, oh, great bar.

06:19.828 --> 06:21.029
Great bar, classy bar.

06:24.997 --> 06:27.502
ROGER: Free drinks for everyone
who saw him threaten me.

06:27.536 --> 06:29.704
Great bar.

06:32.841 --> 06:34.575
All right, pocket square,

06:34.610 --> 06:36.441
time to work your magic.

06:36.669 --> 06:38.536
This is Rihanna.

06:38.571 --> 06:40.271
This is Katy Perry.

06:40.306 --> 06:42.540
This is Selena Gomez.

06:42.575 --> 06:44.976
All right, that completes
today's hotties.

06:45.011 --> 06:46.344
Smith,

06:46.379 --> 06:47.946
this meeting
doesn't concern you.

06:47.980 --> 06:50.148
If we need...

06:53.052 --> 06:54.419
I'm sorry.

06:54.453 --> 06:57.088
I didn't mean to use
a harsh tone there.

06:57.123 --> 07:00.725
Would you step
into my office, please?

07:00.760 --> 07:02.460
We're not to be disturbed.

07:04.096 --> 07:06.765
Unless you see something
funny on YouTube.

07:06.799 --> 07:11.169
Smith, I had no idea you
rock it in the pocket.

07:11.203 --> 07:12.504
Feast your eyes.

07:12.538 --> 07:13.772
(beeps)

07:13.806 --> 07:15.507
(gasps)

07:15.541 --> 07:17.609
You like pocket squares, too?

07:17.643 --> 07:19.110
I do. In fact,

07:19.145 --> 07:20.545
the first time I wore one,

07:20.579 --> 07:22.947
I was at Buzz Aldrin's
bachelor party.

07:22.982 --> 07:26.418
Oh, you're not in
the Inner Circle,

07:26.452 --> 07:27.786
but keep up the good work.

07:27.820 --> 07:28.953
Sir, come quick.

07:28.988 --> 07:31.389
Some frat boys put sunglasses
on a bulldog,

07:31.424 --> 07:34.325
and he's walking around
to "Bad to the Bone."

07:34.360 --> 07:36.361
AGENT: They're pulling
him in a wagon now!

07:40.966 --> 07:43.568
Hayley?

07:43.602 --> 07:45.770
Hey, button-nose,
time to get up.

07:45.805 --> 07:47.238
Got to get ready for work.

07:47.273 --> 07:48.873
(groans) Not feeling so good.

07:48.908 --> 07:50.241
So, listen,
I couldn't help but notice

07:50.276 --> 07:51.976
that Bullock was in the bar
last night.

07:52.011 --> 07:53.445
Any fun stories or anything?

07:53.479 --> 07:55.280
Dad, I can't tell you that.

07:55.314 --> 07:56.581
Bartender's code.

07:56.615 --> 07:57.682
Oh, no, no, of course.

07:57.717 --> 07:59.284
You don't need to tell me
about codes.

07:59.318 --> 08:00.819
Morse, da Vinci,
I follow them all.

08:00.853 --> 08:02.053
Now get up.

08:02.088 --> 08:04.589
Important people need
to unload their secrets on you.

08:04.623 --> 08:06.691
But I'm-I'm just
so hungover.

08:06.726 --> 08:08.426
Bullock's there every night,

08:08.461 --> 08:10.595
and he always insists
that I drink with him.

08:10.629 --> 08:12.964
Oh, maybe I should just
get a different job.

08:12.998 --> 08:14.432
What? Oh, no, no, no.

08:14.467 --> 08:15.967
Come on now,
that's where you're working.

08:16.001 --> 08:17.502
Now, let's not have
any silly talk

08:17.536 --> 08:18.903
of you quitting that job.

08:18.938 --> 08:20.338
Quitting is for Realtors

08:20.372 --> 08:21.673
before they become Realtors.

08:21.707 --> 08:23.708
I'll leave you with that.

08:25.277 --> 08:27.779
(birds twittering, bird squawks)

STEVE: At long last,
Herr Frederick,

08:33.586 --> 08:35.352
what gift have you
brought for me?

08:35.386 --> 08:38.022
SNOT:
The only gift I have, <i>mein King,</i>

08:38.057 --> 08:41.525
is the gift of <i>Liebenspiel.</i>

08:41.559 --> 08:42.994
(frogs croaking)
KLAUS: <i>The end.</i>

08:43.028 --> 08:45.063
SNOT:
<i>I know I'm gonna regret this,</i>

08:45.097 --> 08:47.832
<i>but what exactly is</i> Liebenspiel?

08:47.867 --> 08:49.200
What?!

08:49.235 --> 08:51.736
You don't know the
meaning of <i>Liebenspiel?</i>

08:51.771 --> 08:53.538
Stop asking questions!

08:53.572 --> 08:55.940
We've been listening
to these stupid stories forever.

08:55.975 --> 08:58.943
I can't take another day
off school.

08:58.978 --> 09:01.379
(indistinct crowd chatter)

09:01.413 --> 09:04.215
Hey, button-nose.
Now, don't worry.

09:04.250 --> 09:06.584
I'm not gonna ask you to
break the bartender's code.

09:06.619 --> 09:08.220
I just thought I'd
bring you some flowers

09:08.254 --> 09:09.554
to show how proud I am of you.
