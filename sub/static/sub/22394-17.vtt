00:06.291 --> 00:09.875
Oh, Mickey, this date is so romantic!

00:09.875 --> 00:11.792
Ah, just the two of us.

00:22.542 --> 00:24.250
Goofy? What are you doing here?

00:24.500 --> 00:26.208
You said we were going out!

00:26.208 --> 00:27.542
No, I said...

00:27.834 --> 00:29.166
We were going out.

00:29.166 --> 00:31.125
Right! That's what
I just said!

00:31.125 --> 00:32.417
- No!
- Shh!

00:32.417 --> 00:34.083
You gotta keep it down, Mick!

00:34.083 --> 00:37.041
This is one of them fancy-type
eatin' establishments.

00:37.041 --> 00:39.208
Why thank you, gar-kon.

00:39.583 --> 00:41.375
That's the ticket.

00:42.041 --> 00:43.083
My dogs are barkin'!

00:44.291 --> 00:46.000
Now, then, what's on the menu tonight?

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Uh... romance
is on the menu.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.166
Mmm...
Sounds delicious.

00:52.166 --> 00:54.667
No! I was referring
to minnie!

00:55.000 --> 00:57.625
You look so radiant this evening.

00:57.625 --> 00:58.875
Oh.

00:58.875 --> 01:00.834
Hey! What's the big idea? Shh.

01:01.083 --> 01:03.750
Now, look, goofy, when
two people are alone,

01:03.750 --> 01:05.375
they, uh, they act like that!

01:05.375 --> 01:06.375
Huh?

01:07.417 --> 01:09.458
Oh, you sly dog!

01:10.125 --> 01:12.166
I know what we need to set the mood!

01:12.166 --> 01:13.208
No, no, no, goofy, wait...

01:17.458 --> 01:19.083
Soft candlelight.

01:23.125 --> 01:25.542
Yee-haw!

01:28.709 --> 01:30.542
Yee-haw!

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Yee-hoo-hoo-hoo!

01:33.917 --> 01:37.083
Y'all might like a little intimacy!

01:41.583 --> 01:44.083
And mood music.

01:48.542 --> 01:50.208
Goofy!

01:50.208 --> 01:51.750
Shh!

01:51.750 --> 01:53.875
Maybe we should just go, Mickey.

01:53.875 --> 01:55.000
Go?

01:55.000 --> 01:56.792
But we haven't even had dinner yet!

01:59.875 --> 02:01.917
Dinner is served.

02:01.917 --> 02:04.375
Bone appetite!

02:06.917 --> 02:08.041
Whoa! Goofy!

02:09.917 --> 02:11.208
Hold on, minnie!

02:13.834 --> 02:15.375
Ahh!

02:17.959 --> 02:19.083
Whoa!
Ha-ha!

02:25.625 --> 02:27.000
Ooh!

02:32.875 --> 02:33.917
Goofy, no!

02:35.709 --> 02:37.208
Help, Mickey!

02:37.208 --> 02:38.583
Minnie, where are ya?

02:38.583 --> 02:40.166
Mickey, I'm in here!

02:42.000 --> 02:44.333
- Minnie!
- Shh!

02:44.333 --> 02:46.125
Aw, shush yourselves!

02:48.709 --> 02:50.000
Goofy, we love you.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.083
Well I love you guys, too...

02:51.083 --> 02:52.417
Ah, ah, I'm not finished.

02:52.417 --> 02:54.083
You invited yourself along,

02:54.083 --> 02:55.750
lit a campfire at our table,

02:55.750 --> 02:57.917
ate the table and then ate minnie!

02:57.917 --> 03:00.166
All we wanted was a romantic dinner...

03:00.166 --> 03:01.750
Alone!

03:01.750 --> 03:05.500
Alone? Why didn't
you say so?

03:10.375 --> 03:13.250
Now, isn't this romantic?

03:13.250 --> 03:16.166
Candlelit dinner, mood music.

03:16.166 --> 03:17.750
And best of all,

03:17.750 --> 03:19.291
we're finally alone.

03:19.709 --> 03:22.417
Aw, you know what two people
do when they're alone, right?

03:27.291 --> 03:29.583
Gosh! That tickles!
