00:03.770 --> 00:06.372
REPORTER:
<i>The incident unfolded</i>
<i>shortly after 8 P.M.,</i>

00:06.374 --> 00:09.041
when police say
three men attempted
to break into the vault

00:09.043 --> 00:12.411
of the Westing Savings
and Loan Building
on Cashmin Drive.

00:12.413 --> 00:13.812
The men took
a number of hostages,

00:13.814 --> 00:16.215
including bank President,
Eric Vennerbeck,

00:16.217 --> 00:18.083
who was seriously wounded.

00:18.085 --> 00:20.019
Thankfully,
there were no fatalities

00:20.021 --> 00:23.288
due to the heroic actions
of former heavy-weight champ,
Mike Tyson.

00:23.290 --> 00:25.190
Uh, Mr. Tyson, what happened?

00:25.192 --> 00:27.659
How is it you happen to be
inside the bank tonight?

00:27.661 --> 00:29.228
Well, that's a long story.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.597
(CHUCKLES)
Probably about 11 minutes.

00:31.599 --> 00:32.698
Man, let's see.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.767
I was at my house
getting the mail...

00:36.836 --> 00:38.937
Oh, hell, yeah! Hell, yeah!

00:38.939 --> 00:40.773
They're finally here.
Yeah, yeah.

00:40.775 --> 00:42.441
Everybody come outside.

00:45.678 --> 00:47.513
Check it out.
My new vanity plates.

00:47.515 --> 00:49.815
You know, because I'm
a vegetarian again.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.250
-Dad.
-But...

00:51.252 --> 00:53.018
I'm sorry, I'm so confused.

00:53.020 --> 00:56.422
Beef is gross,
unethical, and yucky.

00:56.424 --> 00:59.858
So, that's what you see
when you read that?

00:59.860 --> 01:00.993
-Okay.
-What?

01:00.995 --> 01:02.928
PIGEON: (LAUGHS)
No, it's great.

01:02.930 --> 01:06.331
"Beef is gross,
unethical, and yucky."
(CHUCKLING)

01:06.333 --> 01:08.333
I mean, that's all I see.

01:08.335 --> 01:10.869
I bet so many vegetarians
are gonna like this,
they're gonna honk at me.

01:10.871 --> 01:13.138
Well, maybe not vegetarians.

01:13.140 --> 01:15.207
(CAR HONKING)

01:17.677 --> 01:19.278
He must be a vegetarian.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.847
We like to put the same thing
in our mouth!

01:28.354 --> 01:30.155

01:30.157 --> 01:31.390
Do... Do you want to read it?

01:31.392 --> 01:33.158
Why would I want to read it?

01:33.160 --> 01:35.160
Well, because you never get
to read them.

01:35.162 --> 01:36.795
Get to read them?

01:36.797 --> 01:39.665
Like it's a big (BLEEP).
I don't give a shit
about any of this.

01:39.667 --> 01:41.300
So you just
want me to read it?

01:41.302 --> 01:43.068
I don't care if you
shove it up your (BLEEP).

01:43.070 --> 01:46.305
Ah! Well that's a lovely thing
to say to a young woman.

02:10.998 --> 02:12.264
I don't wanna get germs.

02:12.266 --> 02:14.266
You know how many people
press that thing.

02:14.268 --> 02:17.035
I bet it's covered
in E. coli, or something.

02:17.037 --> 02:18.470
But you want me to touch it?

02:18.472 --> 02:20.906
You're not gonna get E. coli.
It's very rare.

02:20.908 --> 02:23.942
I just can't risk it,
because I'm a celebrity,
you know.

are we?

02:46.367 --> 02:48.100
Which tower are we going to?

I'm sure it says on the note.

-Damn, I left it at home.
-Oh, well.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.841
Okay, team meeting.
Let's take a vote.

02:55.843 --> 02:58.911
All those in favor
of the North Tower say, "Aye".

02:58.913 --> 03:01.780
All those in favor
of the South Tower say, "Nay".

03:01.782 --> 03:05.050
On the count of three,
everyone say their vote.

03:05.052 --> 03:07.319
One, two, three, North.

03:09.122 --> 03:11.256
Okay, North has it.

03:12.659 --> 03:15.827
Well, again, I'm so sorry,
but you were 40 minutes late

03:15.829 --> 03:18.363
and Mr. Vennerbeck had
to go to his next meeting.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.265
Yeah, we went
to the wrong tower.

03:20.267 --> 03:23.402
Twice. We went
to the wrong tower, twice.

03:23.404 --> 03:25.470
Which doesn't seem possible
but we did it.

03:25.472 --> 03:27.206
Then you should have voted.

03:27.208 --> 03:30.442
Marquess, you forfeited
your right to complain
if you don't vote.

03:30.444 --> 03:32.911
Uh, can we reschedule
for some time tomorrow?

03:32.913 --> 03:35.547
-Oh, I have
something tomorrow.
-What?

03:35.549 --> 03:37.749
-What do you have?
-A (BLEEP) life!

03:37.751 --> 03:39.151
How about that, huh?

03:39.153 --> 03:40.385
That I'm trying to live.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.588
Okay, does tomorrow
at 3:00 work?

03:42.590 --> 03:44.957
-A.M. or P.M.?
-Um, P.M.

03:44.959 --> 03:47.392
Oh, good, but we would have
made either one work.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.294
Do you need validation
for the valet?

03:49.296 --> 03:51.563
-Valet?
-We, we didn't use the valet.

03:51.565 --> 03:54.499
Well, definitely use them,
when you come back tomorrow.

03:54.501 --> 03:57.569
We are so excited to talk
about the mystery.

04:01.608 --> 04:03.976
-Yung, press the button.
-(SIGHS)

04:06.012 --> 04:10.249
So, Mr. Tyson, can you tell
us some of the mysteries
you've done in the past?

04:10.251 --> 04:11.717
Oh, with that bunch?

04:11.719 --> 04:14.953
Let's see. We have
one where a house was haunted.

04:14.955 --> 04:17.623
-Huh.
-We had one where Yung
got kidnapped.

04:17.625 --> 04:20.592
Oh, so you all participate
in the mysteries.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.527
Absolutely. We're a team.

04:22.529 --> 04:25.464
Maybe we should go ahead
and start talking numbers.

04:25.466 --> 04:26.698
How much do you charge?

04:26.700 --> 04:28.934
Oh, we don't charge
for mysteries.

04:28.936 --> 04:32.204
Jesus Christ.
Why do you always have
to tell people that?

04:32.206 --> 04:34.239
Well, I would say you're hired

04:34.241 --> 04:37.409
but we should do
our due diligence, and meet
with a few more people first.

04:37.411 --> 04:41.313
Uh, so why don't we have
Barbara call you when we've
made our decision.

04:41.315 --> 04:45.050
Well, I guess
whatever the mystery is,
it's not a time sensitive one.

04:45.052 --> 04:48.053
I like taking these meetings,
so, I hope we have more.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.989
Uh, sorry, what kind
of vehicle is it?

04:51.991 --> 04:54.159
It's a 1991 Mystery Mobile.

04:54.161 --> 04:56.762
Mmm. You see your keys here?

04:57.864 --> 04:59.398
No, I don't see them.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.867
It's okay.
We'll find your car.
What's the license plate?

05:01.869 --> 05:03.335
B, I, G, U, Y.

05:03.337 --> 05:05.871
I bet you valet
in the other tower.

05:05.873 --> 05:08.607
Hey, you got a vehicle
with license plate

05:09.409 --> 05:10.776
"Bi Guy?"

05:10.778 --> 05:13.011
VALET 2: <i> Uh, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>Can you repeat that?</i>

05:13.013 --> 05:14.646
Bi guy.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.782
Like... Bisexual guy.

05:16.784 --> 05:18.517
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I see it.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.452
Oh, okay.

05:20.454 --> 05:22.554
I bet that's what that thing
is over the window.

05:22.556 --> 05:24.623
Like, gay people
have the rainbow,

05:24.625 --> 05:26.625
the bisexuals have that.

05:26.627 --> 05:28.393
(CHUCKLES) Pretty cool.

05:28.395 --> 05:29.861
VALET 2: <i> I'll bring</i>
<i>it right over.</i>

05:29.863 --> 05:31.396
You're about five minutes,
boss.

05:32.365 --> 05:34.299
Hey, can I pet your bird?

05:34.301 --> 05:35.767
-Sure.
-PIGEON: What?

05:37.337 --> 05:38.804
MIKE: Hello?

05:40.139 --> 05:42.674
Who? Barbara?

05:42.676 --> 05:44.910
It must be for you.
I don't know a Barbara.

05:44.912 --> 05:47.412
I've never met
a Barbara in my life.

05:47.414 --> 05:49.281
Come on, give me that. Hello.

05:49.283 --> 05:50.982
Oh, yes, hi.

05:50.984 --> 05:52.651
(GASPS) Oh, wonderful.

05:52.653 --> 05:55.620
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay, great.

05:55.622 --> 05:57.222
We'll see you Saturday night.

05:57.224 --> 06:01.093
(GASPS) That was the woman
from Westing Savings and Loan.

06:01.095 --> 06:03.095
(GASPS) We got the job.

06:03.097 --> 06:06.098
A-ha, no way. We did, huh?
That's amazing.

06:06.100 --> 06:10.035
You're not pulling our leg
are you? You're serious.
We really got the job?

06:11.704 --> 06:13.839
-Are you done?
-So what's the mystery?

06:13.841 --> 06:16.208
Okay, well.
It's not what we usually do,

06:16.210 --> 06:19.177
but I actually think it'll
be a fun change of pace,

06:19.179 --> 06:21.046
so, keep an open mind.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.681
I know what's going on.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.483
They don't think
we solve mysteries,

06:24.485 --> 06:26.752
they think that we plan
mystery dinner parties.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.987
And they want us to do
one for all their employees.

06:28.989 --> 06:30.856
You know, as a,
"Thank you for a great year."

06:30.858 --> 06:33.392
What, Michael?
How did you know all that?

06:33.394 --> 06:36.595
I got an email from someone
named Barbara, like,
a week and a half ago.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.029
-Oh, my God.
-Wait, so,

06:38.031 --> 06:40.265
these people think
we're party planners?

06:40.267 --> 06:42.401
Oh, come on. It'll be fun.

06:42.403 --> 06:44.002
I'll take the lead, please.

06:44.004 --> 06:46.638
I used to throw parties
like this all the time.

06:46.640 --> 06:49.007
I threw one for Sir
Rodney Pumpbutters

06:49.009 --> 06:52.077
in 1874
for his coming-out party.

06:52.079 --> 06:55.414
Uh, yeah. I wouldn't think
you need a coming-out party
when your name is

06:55.416 --> 06:57.149
Rodney Pumpbutters.

06:57.151 --> 06:58.850
Not that kind of coming-out.

06:58.852 --> 07:01.620
He was entering society
as a gentleman.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.455
It was a different time.

07:03.457 --> 07:06.091
Now, the key
to a good mystery party

07:06.093 --> 07:07.426
is the theme.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.461
(GASPS) Oh, I know.

07:09.463 --> 07:11.563
What about Oriental?

07:11.565 --> 07:14.032
The gowns and the silks
and the Oriental makeup

07:14.034 --> 07:16.268
with the white face
and the red lip, oh!

07:16.270 --> 07:18.904
There's so much we can do
with the Oriental costumes,

07:18.906 --> 07:21.206
the bowing, the binding
of the little feet,

07:21.208 --> 07:24.209
and there are all those
different types of Orientals.

07:24.211 --> 07:26.011
You've got um, concubine.

07:26.013 --> 07:28.547
Your dragon lady,
your sumo wrestler man...

07:28.549 --> 07:31.450
Oh! Oh!
And the Oriental music.

07:31.452 --> 07:35.687
The gongs and the chimes
that the Orientals play
so beautifully.

07:35.689 --> 07:39.991
Um, are you aware
that you just said Oriental,
like, 50 times?

07:39.993 --> 07:41.793
(GASPS) And that's bad?

07:41.795 --> 07:43.895
No, not if you want people
to think you're racist.

07:43.897 --> 07:46.364
(GASPS) Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

07:46.366 --> 07:49.801
Oh! Sometimes I'm just
an old fool from the 1800s

07:49.803 --> 07:52.170
who never stops putting
his foot in his mouth.

07:52.172 --> 07:54.439
-(LAUGHS)
-What? What?

07:54.441 --> 07:57.275
It's some vulgar joke
about what I put in my mouth.

07:57.277 --> 07:58.877
Go on, say it.

07:58.879 --> 08:01.646
Oh, no, no, no.
Sometimes it's even
more special to just...

08:01.648 --> 08:03.014
Keep it in here.

08:03.016 --> 08:06.518
(GASPS) What about a Wild West
theme? Huh?

08:06.520 --> 08:08.687
-Cowboys and Indians.
-Native Americans.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.155
Okay, you know what.
I'm from a different time.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.691
Let it go, okay. I'll figure
out a theme myself.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.459
In fact,
the less you all know,
the better.

08:14.461 --> 08:15.894
It'll be more fun for you.

08:15.896 --> 08:18.663
Now, who's coming
with me to the fabric store?

08:18.665 --> 08:20.031
I am! I am!

08:20.033 --> 08:21.967
Oh, well, I asked.

08:24.704 --> 08:26.705
Of course, everyone dressed
like cowboys.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.840
I'm the only Indian here...
Native American.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.709
-Whose the murderer?
-Michael.

08:30.711 --> 08:33.078
I'm not telling you,
so quit asking.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.313
-There are clues scattered
throughout the party.
-(GUN SHOT)

08:35.315 --> 08:37.148
-(SCREAMING)
-(GUN SHOTS)

08:38.451 --> 08:40.585
Everybody on the ground. Now!

08:40.587 --> 08:42.621
Except for you.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.990
-Come with me.
-VENNERBECK: Okay, okay.
Okay, okay.

08:44.992 --> 08:48.426
Whoa, Marquess!
That was so surprising, man.

08:48.428 --> 08:50.462
Oh, man, so surprising.

08:50.464 --> 08:52.664
-Whose the murderer?
-Michael.

08:52.666 --> 08:54.232
This isn't
part of the mystery.

08:54.234 --> 08:55.467
MAN: Shut the (BLEEP) up.

08:55.469 --> 08:57.869
I will blow your
(BLEEP) head off.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.671
(LAUGHING) Oh (BLEEP).

08:59.673 --> 09:04.009
(LAUGHING)

09:04.011 --> 09:06.745
This guy is cool.
I like this guy.

09:06.747 --> 09:08.547
Give me the code to the vault.

09:08.549 --> 09:09.748
I don't have it.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.483
-(GUN SHOT)
-(GUESTS SCREAM)

09:11.485 --> 09:13.418
-(LAUGHS)
-ROBBER: The code?

09:13.420 --> 09:15.020
VENNERBECK: I told you.
I don't have it.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.555
-(GUN SHOT)
-(SCREAMS)

09:16.557 --> 09:17.789
I can't believe...
This is great.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.157
(WHISPERING)
Michael, do something.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.293
But you haven't told
me what my part is.

09:21.295 --> 09:22.594
-(GUN SHOT)
-(SCREAMS)

09:22.596 --> 09:25.096
Oh, my God, this is so real.
I love it.

09:26.365 --> 09:28.633
So that part went
on for way too long, man.

09:28.635 --> 09:30.735
Gunshot, scream.
Gunshot, scream.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.337
It was, like, "Man, come on."

09:32.339 --> 09:34.839
Then the actor that was
playing the bank robber,
right.

09:34.841 --> 09:36.474
He was right next to me,
and he, like,

09:36.476 --> 09:38.009
stepped on my (BLEEP) hand,

09:38.011 --> 09:39.878
and, man,
I just went crazy, man.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.080
And I beat the shit
out of all of them, man.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.416
Maybe I was irritable,
because I stopped eating meat.

09:44.418 --> 09:46.017
I don't know.

09:46.019 --> 09:48.520
So I just want to apologize
to Westing Savings and Loan

09:48.522 --> 09:50.155
for ruining
their mystery party.

09:50.157 --> 09:52.791
But most of all, I want
to apologize to Marquess.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.759
Marquess, get in here.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.795
Marquess planned
this whole thing.

09:56.797 --> 09:58.063
It was all his idea.

09:58.065 --> 09:59.764
Sorry, did you say
he was involved?

09:59.766 --> 10:02.701
Involved? He orchestrated
the entire thing.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.936
This is your mastermind
right here.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.671
Sir, we're going to have
to ask you a few questions.

10:06.673 --> 10:07.839
But... What?

10:07.841 --> 10:09.574
-No! Oh!
-Come on.

10:09.576 --> 10:10.809
MARQUESS: No!
COP: Hey.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.744
You don't understand. Ow!

10:12.746 --> 10:15.313
Oh, my God,
it's all so real...

10:15.315 --> 10:19.017
Except the cops would
never treat a white guy
like this.

10:19.019 --> 10:21.853
Oh, I get it. Because he's
Native American, right?

10:34.600 --> 10:39.971
Suck my nectarine
toes... Nail?

10:39.973 --> 10:42.073
-Screaming...
-(BUZZER)

10:43.442 --> 10:46.111
In suction cups and...

10:46.113 --> 10:48.580
-celebal, what...
-(BUZZER)

10:48.582 --> 10:50.015
-Too hot for you.
-(BELL RINGING)

10:50.017 --> 10:53.251
Ah! I can't believe
I got that.

10:53.919 --> 10:56.121
You are a queer...

10:57.490 --> 10:59.224
-Tick.
-(BUZZER)
