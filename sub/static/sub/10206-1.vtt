02:05.250 --> 02:06.625
Come on, Carl!

02:21.083 --> 02:23.458
<i>7-Ida-06 over at Hal's Tire Shop.</i>

02:23.625 --> 02:25.833
<i>There's been a break-in.</i>

02:25.958 --> 02:28.500
06 en route to the tire shop.

03:05.292 --> 03:07.458
I found her.
She was out here by the shed

03:07.625 --> 03:09.917
and she was just lying on the ground.

03:10.083 --> 03:12.792
And I could tell she was dead
the second I saw her.

03:12.958 --> 03:15.167
And, um, I just don't get it.

03:20.292 --> 03:23.333
We're not used to things like this
happening in this neighborhood.

03:27.833 --> 03:29.667
I just can't believe
there was anybody that--

03:29.792 --> 03:31.292
- Hey, how you doin'?
- Hey.

03:31.458 --> 03:32.833
So, do you know this girl?

03:32.958 --> 03:35.458
- No. So sad.
- Anyone else been around here?

03:35.625 --> 03:37.417
Oh, yeah, my uncle George--

03:37.583 --> 03:38.958
he lives across the street--
he was here.

03:39.125 --> 03:41.250
His wife Arlene called the police

03:41.417 --> 03:43.625
and then my sister Bonnie
came over with the twins.

03:43.792 --> 03:45.833
And there have been
a lot of people over here.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.250
- A little regular family picnic, huh?
- People are curious.

03:48.417 --> 03:50.667
I want you to stay here with the officer.
Don't go nowhere.

03:50.833 --> 03:52.833
- Oh, okay.
- Ma'am, right this way.

03:55.417 --> 03:57.917
- You wanna run that tape back 10 feet?
- Yes, sir.

04:00.750 --> 04:02.708
How long do you think
she's been trampling on the crime scene?

04:02.833 --> 04:04.583
Too long.

04:07.583 --> 04:09.958
No obvious blood.

04:10.125 --> 04:11.583
Lots of trauma.

04:11.750 --> 04:13.958
Look at her knees.

04:14.125 --> 04:16.750
Toes are scraped.
There's no drag marks.

04:53.250 --> 04:54.750
No rigor.

04:54.917 --> 04:57.167
It's probably under two hours.

04:57.333 --> 04:59.083
It didn't happen here.

05:04.167 --> 05:06.333
Wanna wait for Crime Scene
before you start dicking with the body?

05:06.500 --> 05:07.833
It's gonna rain.

05:11.583 --> 05:13.250
I'll go run tape and try to keep

05:13.417 --> 05:15.333
this thundering herd
off the rest of the evidence.

05:15.500 --> 05:19.000
Hey, princess! Go get me a tarp.

05:24.167 --> 05:25.917
She's fuckin' sitting
on a pile of pissants.

05:26.083 --> 05:27.750
Yeah.

05:27.917 --> 05:30.417
What's that? Gray fiber?

05:58.458 --> 06:00.583
Any of you clowns call Crime Scene?

06:03.167 --> 06:05.667
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee;

06:05.833 --> 06:07.583
blessed art thou amongst women,

06:07.750 --> 06:10.083
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus...

06:10.250 --> 06:11.583
Brian.

06:11.750 --> 06:15.083
Pray for us sinners,
now and at the hour of our death.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.750
Amen.

06:35.333 --> 06:36.958
Hey!

06:38.500 --> 06:40.667
Come here.

06:46.250 --> 06:47.917
What's in the bag?

06:48.983 --> 06:50.083
I knew you'd find me.

06:50.250 --> 06:53.000
It's not a game, Anne.
What's in the bag?

06:53.125 --> 06:56.083
Milk of magnesia. I get stomachaches.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.583
All right, get in.

07:03.125 --> 07:06.125
You're on juvie probation.
You're supposed to be home.

07:06.292 --> 07:08.750
My mom says don't come home
till the porch light's out.

07:08.917 --> 07:12.000
- So you can talk to her.
- She still got all the boyfriends?

07:12.125 --> 07:14.292
Ain't you the one
with all the boyfriends?

07:17.292 --> 07:20.250
I got diamonds put on each finger.
Aren't they pretty?

07:20.417 --> 07:22.167
That's real nice.

08:06.250 --> 08:08.083
I'm pushing the damn thing!

08:08.250 --> 08:09.383
Every time I go--

08:20.333 --> 08:21.750
How you doin', Lucie?

08:21.917 --> 08:24.167
I'm all right.

08:24.333 --> 08:27.000
You and I both know she's on probation.
What's she doing out?

08:28.083 --> 08:29.958
She don't come home from school.

08:30.125 --> 08:31.833
So what you're telling me
is you want her to come home

08:32.000 --> 08:33.417
right after school, right?

08:33.582 --> 08:35.250
Yeah, of course.

08:35.417 --> 08:37.582
- You hear that?
- Yeah, I heard it.

08:37.750 --> 08:40.125
All right, I'm gonna be coming by here
from time to time,

08:40.292 --> 08:42.332
make sure she's home, okay?

08:43.500 --> 08:47.292
I can call you
when she doesn't show up.

08:47.458 --> 08:50.792
You don't need to be wasting
your time on us, Officer Brian.

08:53.958 --> 08:56.667
Come on, honey. Supper's on.

08:57.667 --> 08:58.750
Mike.

08:59.917 --> 09:03.250
Just wait over here by the car.
Don't move.

09:03.417 --> 09:05.250
You been warned, princess.

09:05.417 --> 09:06.583
Come on, ladies!

09:07.250 --> 09:08.750
Let's go.

09:08.917 --> 09:11.417
I told you. Let's go home.
Come on.

09:11.583 --> 09:14.583
Hey! Come on, everyone. Move.

09:16.583 --> 09:18.167
You got a wife and two kids, boy.

09:18.333 --> 09:21.250
Come on up here, guys.
Against the truck, please.

09:21.417 --> 09:23.375
Come on, keep going. Keep going.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.333
What'd I do?

09:38.167 --> 09:41.750
- What'd you just say?
- What'd I do?

09:44.083 --> 09:47.125
So, were you waiting in line
for a blow job or giving them?

09:52.625 --> 09:54.333
ID.

09:57.167 --> 09:59.625
You, too, dipshit.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.750
Now, why don't I call personnel
at the plant,

10:13.917 --> 10:16.250
have you move on down the road?

10:21.167 --> 10:23.167
I like it here.

10:25.917 --> 10:27.917
What you doin', brother?

10:29.417 --> 10:32.083
- Just taking out the garbage.
- Mm-hmm.

10:32.250 --> 10:35.500
This one here-- that's Lucie's son.

10:35.667 --> 10:39.083
Yeah, he's probably banging her, too.

10:39.250 --> 10:41.000
Go on inside.

10:42.583 --> 10:44.250
What, your daddy drop you
on your fuckin' head or something?

10:44.417 --> 10:46.000
Get in.

11:00.833 --> 11:04.417
If it gets bad around here,
you call me, okay?

11:06.292 --> 11:08.583
Come on in the house now, baby.

11:08.750 --> 11:10.292
You come on in the house now.

11:11.583 --> 11:13.250
Come on.

11:15.583 --> 11:18.083
You just made it worse
for that little girl.

11:19.083 --> 11:21.000
Social work ain't gonna save her, Brian.

11:42.833 --> 11:44.583
This is Detective Heigh.

11:44.750 --> 11:46.458
<i>Hey, Brian, this is Pam.</i>

11:46.625 --> 11:48.833
<i>Listen, hon, we got a girl
gone missing over here.</i>

11:48.958 --> 11:52.417
- How long missing?
- 26 hours and no leads.

11:52.583 --> 11:55.542
It's a-- a new...

11:56.958 --> 11:59.625
light green Toyota, Texas plate-- GHY.

11:59.792 --> 12:02.083
<i>The girl's name is Kirsten Laine.</i>

12:02.250 --> 12:03.833
You got your command post up yet?

12:04.000 --> 12:06.250
Yeah, real soon.
I'm gonna call this in to your duty officer

12:06.417 --> 12:09.458
'cause, listen, hon,
I could really use your help around here.

12:09.625 --> 12:11.417
Yeah, Pam, I can't do that.

12:11.583 --> 12:13.167
How come?

12:13.292 --> 12:15.500
We got a homicide of our own over here.

12:15.667 --> 12:18.000
Female, blonde, well-dressed?

12:18.167 --> 12:20.833
Female, probably a street kid, dark hair.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.417
Oh, come on, now.

12:22.583 --> 12:25.292
Why don't you leave the early work
to that ace detective partner of yours

12:25.458 --> 12:26.833
and help me out?

12:26.958 --> 12:28.417
After all, he is the best.

12:28.583 --> 12:31.125
There ain't a woman in the world
who don't love how I do it, sugar.

12:31.292 --> 12:33.958
<i>Okay? So, now, don't try
phoning our chief,</i>

12:34.125 --> 12:36.000
trying to pull some strings
and all that other kind of horseshit.

12:36.125 --> 12:37.542
<i>Take me off speaker.</i>

12:37.667 --> 12:38.917
Pam.

12:39.083 --> 12:40.500
Would you request your partner
not continue to be

12:40.625 --> 12:42.750
the asshole he was
when I was married to him?

12:42.917 --> 12:44.875
They're just going to refuse you permission.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.917
'Cause of last time.

12:47.083 --> 12:49.250
<i>I cannot go into your jurisdiction again</i>

12:49.417 --> 12:51.083
Your captain's going to call my captain,

12:51.250 --> 12:53.792
and he's going to unload about
how many hours and money they spent

12:53.958 --> 12:55.750
on me working on other counties' cases.

12:56.792 --> 12:59.458
Listen, Bri, this is looking
like a real stinker.

12:59.625 --> 13:01.500
We just located the car.

13:01.625 --> 13:03.417
<i>Where?</i>

13:03.583 --> 13:05.667
It's in the fields.

13:10.792 --> 13:13.667
All right, right now what you have
is a missing person.

13:13.792 --> 13:16.625
If you find a body--

13:16.792 --> 13:19.083
if you find a body,
you call me right away.

13:21.417 --> 13:23.833
Thank you, hon.

13:28.417 --> 13:32.625
See, my daddy always said,
"Sometimes you get;

13:32.792 --> 13:34.792
sometimes you get got."

13:36.833 --> 13:39.500
I'll let you suss out
what just happened to you.

13:56.583 --> 13:59.083
Clark County Sheriffâ€™s Office...

14:05.792 --> 14:07.667
- This is the area where six bodies...
- Come on, boy.

14:07.833 --> 14:10.583
- since 1970 have been found.
- Easy.

14:11.958 --> 14:13.667
Damn it.

14:19.083 --> 14:20.667
Say it ain't so.

14:20.833 --> 14:22.583
Ma'am, can I see some ID?

14:22.750 --> 14:24.917
Can I see some ID, please?

14:25.083 --> 14:27.125
Why, yes, Officer, of course.

14:27.292 --> 14:28.708
By the way, you the one
selling tickets here?

14:28.833 --> 14:30.750
'Cause I'd sure as hell
like to buy one.

14:30.917 --> 14:33.625
Detective Stall. You think maybe
you could do me a little favor

14:33.792 --> 14:36.000
and get every asshole
off my crime scene right now?

14:36.167 --> 14:37.833
While you're at it,
why don't you go ahead and make a list

14:37.958 --> 14:40.583
of everybody whose footprints,
fingerprints, tire prints,

14:40.750 --> 14:44.583
and hoof prints I might find on top
of the real goddamn evidence?

14:44.750 --> 14:46.750
- Back up!
- Eddie, come on.

14:46.917 --> 14:49.583
- Get that fuckin' horse out of here.
- You heard her!

14:49.750 --> 14:51.750
Where the hell is CSI?

15:15.333 --> 15:20.917
<i>Look on down from the bridge</i>

15:21.083 --> 15:25.833
<i>There's still fountains</i>

15:26.000 --> 15:28.625
<i>Down there</i>

15:31.458 --> 15:37.250
<i>Look on down from the bridge</i>

15:37.417 --> 15:41.667
<i>It's still raining</i>

15:41.833 --> 15:44.833
<i>Up here...</i>

15:45.000 --> 15:47.083
Lee!

15:47.250 --> 15:53.000
<i>Everybody seems so far away from me</i>

15:55.333 --> 16:01.292
<i>Everybody just wants to be free</i>

16:03.125 --> 16:08.792
<i>Look away from the sky</i>

16:08.958 --> 16:12.375
<i>It's no different</i>

16:12.500 --> 16:15.250
<i>When you're leaving home</i>

16:19.000 --> 16:24.583
<i>I can't be the same thing
to you now</i>

16:24.750 --> 16:28.000
<i>I'm just gone</i>

16:29.250 --> 16:32.000
<i>Just gone...</i>

16:32.125 --> 16:34.625
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi.

16:35.625 --> 16:37.000
Okay day?

16:37.125 --> 16:39.833
It was okay.

16:42.333 --> 16:46.792
<i>How could I say good...</i>

16:50.083 --> 16:52.458
You better slow down on that 40.

16:55.958 --> 16:57.583
Shit.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.083
The 5-0.

17:01.750 --> 17:03.958
- What's up, B?
- Hey, how are you?

17:04.125 --> 17:06.250
- How's everybody today?
- All right.

17:06.416 --> 17:08.583
- Staying out of the heat?
- Tryin'.

17:08.750 --> 17:11.583
- Lady Worm, how are you?
- What you got?

17:11.750 --> 17:14.208
I got to show you guys something.
I need you to take a look

17:14.333 --> 17:16.291
and let me know if you've seen
this little girl before.

17:18.083 --> 17:20.833
- He came right up here to the house.
- Sheila.

17:24.958 --> 17:27.291
What happened to your hand, Sheila?

17:27.458 --> 17:29.167
35 stitches.

17:29.292 --> 17:30.917
Doctor taking them out tomorrow.

17:31.083 --> 17:33.083
Her sister's boyfriend's pit bull got her.

17:34.417 --> 17:35.667
I should have stayed out of the yard,

17:35.792 --> 17:37.417
but they told me the dog was locked up.

17:37.583 --> 17:39.750
- I told you they didn't lock that gate.
- They told you.

17:39.917 --> 17:41.917
Anyway, he came right up here
to the house asking about her.

17:42.083 --> 17:43.792
Who's "he"?

17:43.958 --> 17:45.500
- Levon.
- Sheila.

17:45.667 --> 17:47.667
- Levon.
- See...

17:47.792 --> 17:50.917
Did you know that they crossed
a pit bull with a shih tzu?

17:51.083 --> 17:53.417
What the hell is a shih tzu?
What are you talking about?

17:53.583 --> 17:55.833
One of them little Chinese dogs, man--
one of them little bitty dogs.

17:55.958 --> 17:57.667
That must have hurt.

17:59.333 --> 18:01.667
- It's called a bullshit.
- You--

18:01.792 --> 18:03.292
Are you gonna ask her
if it's one of her girls or what?

18:03.458 --> 18:04.458
Or you just gonna read 'em
a bedtime story?

18:04.625 --> 18:06.500
That's all you about, is bullshit.
You all bullshit.

18:06.667 --> 18:08.833
- Come on.
- That's all you about.

18:08.958 --> 18:11.750
I'm gonna go see a man about a man.

18:11.917 --> 18:14.417
Check with CSI. I'll meet you there.

18:14.583 --> 18:16.417
All right, let's go back,
talk about this girl.

18:16.583 --> 18:17.958
She's about 15 years old,

18:18.125 --> 18:20.167
just a little crack ho from up north--

18:20.333 --> 18:23.125
Dallas or somewhere.

18:23.292 --> 18:24.667
We called her the Little Debbie.

18:24.833 --> 18:27.500
She stayed everywhere,
slept where she could,

18:27.667 --> 18:30.292
- sometimes over at Reba's shelter.
- Really?

18:30.458 --> 18:32.667
And them boys ain't scared of nobody.

18:34.250 --> 18:36.917
And the scary one is the white dude.

19:12.625 --> 19:15.500
Yo, which way be Edwards Street?

19:19.583 --> 19:22.333
- Say, you want a ride?
- I'm good.

19:22.458 --> 19:25.083
Come on, you sure look like
you could use a ride.

19:27.125 --> 19:28.958
Don't be teasing me now, girl.

19:44.125 --> 19:46.833
- Lunchtime.
- All right, you good now, boys.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.917
How you doing?

19:55.583 --> 19:58.083
I'm Brian, Texas City Police Department.

19:58.250 --> 20:00.250
I know your daddy.

20:00.417 --> 20:02.917
Don't look at her. Look at me.

20:04.125 --> 20:07.083
I'm extending my hand here.
You should shake it.

20:08.750 --> 20:11.333
- I'm not from here.
- You got any ID?

20:17.167 --> 20:19.083
You seen this girl,

20:19.250 --> 20:21.417
Levon Chalmers?

20:21.583 --> 20:23.750
She came to me,

20:23.917 --> 20:26.250
said a guy was following her,
giving her the fix.

20:26.417 --> 20:29.167
I even think I seen him once.

20:29.292 --> 20:31.792
You know her name?

20:31.958 --> 20:33.625
Not really.

20:33.792 --> 20:35.167
- Not really?
- No.

20:35.292 --> 20:37.250
Why don't you ask him
what he call her?

20:50.500 --> 20:52.417
All right, Levon, I need you
to come down to the station

20:52.583 --> 20:55.458
and talk to me and my partner,
look at some pictures.

20:55.625 --> 20:58.417
I'll give you my card.

20:58.583 --> 21:01.958
You get lost or you need a ride,

21:02.125 --> 21:04.125
use that card and you call me, okay?

21:04.292 --> 21:05.667
Most definitely.

21:05.833 --> 21:08.250
Most definitely. I'll see you soon.

21:08.417 --> 21:10.375
All right.

21:15.958 --> 21:17.667
Of course, it's only been a few weeks,

21:17.792 --> 21:19.750
but he has been a good employee, though.

21:19.917 --> 21:21.667
No problems.

21:56.792 --> 21:59.083
Every time some little bitch
gets her period,

21:59.250 --> 22:01.250
y'all gotta drag my ass in here?

22:01.417 --> 22:04.125
Bet that one right there
is on the rag.

22:04.292 --> 22:06.583
Bring him in first.

22:06.750 --> 22:09.000
Can we sit in?

22:09.125 --> 22:12.500
Okay, but don't talk, don't smile,

22:12.625 --> 22:15.000
don't even blink if he looks at you.

22:43.167 --> 22:45.500
What are you doing for women
these days, Salter?

22:47.083 --> 22:48.667
Don't look at him.

22:50.750 --> 22:52.625
What are you doing for ladies?

22:52.792 --> 22:54.917
I ain't been with a woman
since I got out.

22:55.083 --> 22:57.417
You just lie to me?

22:57.583 --> 22:59.833
Did you not meet my girlfriend,

23:00.000 --> 23:02.292
Pamela Palm?

23:07.917 --> 23:09.750
Tell me the truth.
Tell me the truth.

23:09.917 --> 23:12.500
Got a hooker. I give her money.

23:12.667 --> 23:15.583
- Is that it?
- Yeah, I got a couple of 'em.

23:19.250 --> 23:20.333
Jesus Christ.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.625
I hope he don't need medical attention.

23:31.500 --> 23:33.167
You had to call my chief, huh?

23:33.333 --> 23:37.083
Yeah, and I asked for Brian.
Where's Brian?

23:38.750 --> 23:41.750
If Brian gets stuck in your case,
we'll never get him out.

23:42.958 --> 23:45.167
So you get Prince Charming instead.

23:46.417 --> 23:49.375
It's okay. I feel the same way.

23:49.500 --> 23:51.833
It's 48 hours. Just make the best of it.

24:01.667 --> 24:04.667
<i>Little Orphan Annie says,
when the blaze is blue</i>

24:04.792 --> 24:08.750
<i>An' the lamp-wick sputters,
an' the wind goes woo</i>

24:08.917 --> 24:12.375
<i>An' you hear the winds quit,
an' the moon is gray</i>

24:12.500 --> 24:15.583
<i>An' the lightnin' bugs in dew
is all squenched away...</i>

24:15.750 --> 24:17.500
<i>You better mind yer parents</i>

24:17.625 --> 24:19.750
<i>An' yer teachers fond an' dear</i>

24:19.917 --> 24:22.750
<i>An' cherish all that loves you,
an' dry the orphan tears</i>

24:22.917 --> 24:26.250
<i>An' he'p the poor an' needy ones
who cluster all about</i>

24:26.417 --> 24:30.250
<i>Or the goblins will git you
if you don't watch out.</i>

24:38.250 --> 24:40.667
- Hey, Reba, how you doin'?
- Hey, Brian, how are you?

24:40.792 --> 24:42.667
- Got something for you.
- Thank you.

24:42.833 --> 24:44.250
I need you to take a look
at this for me.

24:44.417 --> 24:46.458
All right.

24:48.625 --> 24:51.417
- What are you doing here?
- She's been hanging out here lately.

24:52.417 --> 24:54.750
You know, the girls upstairs
knew her real well.

24:54.917 --> 24:56.917
Come on, let me take y'all up.

24:58.250 --> 25:01.208
Man on the floor!
Man on the floor!

25:01.333 --> 25:02.833
Hey, guys.

25:02.958 --> 25:05.500
I'm Brian, Texas City Police Department.

25:05.667 --> 25:09.167
This is my partner Mike.
Mind if I sit down?

25:11.625 --> 25:13.000
What's your names?

25:13.125 --> 25:15.792
- Imani.
- I'm Marie.

25:15.958 --> 25:18.083
Marie?

25:18.250 --> 25:20.917
- How long you been in here?
- Four months.

25:21.083 --> 25:22.667
How old are you?

25:22.833 --> 25:24.833
15. She just turned 14.

25:24.958 --> 25:27.583
You have family in here--
a mother, aunt, something?

25:29.958 --> 25:31.750
All right, I have to show you guys a picture.

25:31.917 --> 25:34.083
I need to know if you know this girl.

25:35.625 --> 25:37.750
You ever seen her before?

25:37.917 --> 25:39.583
She was our friend.

25:39.750 --> 25:42.000
You know her name?

25:42.125 --> 25:44.500
- Debbie Mills.
- Debbie what?

25:44.667 --> 25:47.667
- Debbie Mills.
- Debbie Mills.

25:47.833 --> 25:50.417
We kept her ID for her.

25:53.458 --> 25:55.958
Mike, you got that other picture?

25:57.958 --> 25:59.917
You ever seen this guy around?

26:01.500 --> 26:04.750
- Yeah.
- Was that her pimp?

26:06.917 --> 26:08.750
Was that her pimp?

26:09.833 --> 26:13.000
- Look, she had to eat.
- You ever seen him smack her?

26:14.250 --> 26:17.500
She would come here to hide from him
and the white guy.

26:17.625 --> 26:19.750
They followed her here
and they dragged her out of bed.

26:19.917 --> 26:22.083
- What else?
- He kicked her. He punched her.

26:22.250 --> 26:25.292
- Yeah?
- He always made her cry.

26:25.458 --> 26:28.500
- What else did he do?
- Tried to take all her money.

26:28.667 --> 26:31.917
That's why we hid her real ID
and her money for her.

26:32.083 --> 26:34.833
You said "white guy."
What'd he look like?

26:35.000 --> 26:37.333
Pointy chin.

26:37.458 --> 26:39.333
Go on, then.

26:40.417 --> 26:42.917
- Short blond hair.
- How short?

26:43.083 --> 26:45.417
I don't know! Just short blond hair

26:45.583 --> 26:49.417
- Go on.
- Some tattoos. That's all I know.

26:49.583 --> 26:51.333
- Were they on his arms?
- On his arm and his neck.

26:51.500 --> 26:53.833
Okay.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.292
Good. Give me your IDs.

26:57.417 --> 26:59.500
Thank you.

27:02.667 --> 27:04.667
Don't look at me like that.

27:06.333 --> 27:08.583
07 to base.
We're gonna need CPS down here

27:08.750 --> 27:11.167
at Reba's shelter on North Main.

27:13.750 --> 27:16.792
Texas City Police Department.
Please hold.

27:16.958 --> 27:18.917
Hey, Levon. Sorry we're late.

27:19.083 --> 27:21.250
- Thank you, thank you.
- Well, okay.

27:21.417 --> 27:23.375
You wanted to ask me some questions--
here I am.

27:23.500 --> 27:25.917
All right, good. And, yeah.

27:26.083 --> 27:29.625
Interview with Levon Chalmers
by Detectives Heigh and Souder.

27:29.792 --> 27:31.500
I'm glad you want to cooperate, Levon.

27:31.625 --> 27:34.583
You came in here on your own accord,
so you can leave whenever you want.

27:34.750 --> 27:36.917
That's greatly appreciated.

27:37.083 --> 27:39.000
Here's your rights sheet.
I'm sure you've seen that before.

27:39.125 --> 27:41.333
Will you sign that for me, please?

27:42.958 --> 27:45.167
- Thank you.
- This'll be easy.

27:45.333 --> 27:47.500
All I really want to know

27:47.667 --> 27:52.250
is how you get a 14-year-old girl
to become a prostitute.

27:52.417 --> 27:54.583
She said she was 15, man.

27:54.750 --> 27:58.292
So, you knew she was a minor.
Okay. Good.

28:02.583 --> 28:04.792
And you ever beat her up?

28:08.125 --> 28:11.000
Okay, did you ever hold her
against her will?

28:13.333 --> 28:16.292
Did you ever make her suck a dick
in the front seat of a truck

28:16.458 --> 28:19.667
and then you kind of pulled her out
and beat the living shit out of her?

28:19.792 --> 28:21.500
Bri, Pam's on the phone.

28:23.958 --> 28:26.917
- I told you only to talk to me.
- You said I could go.

28:27.083 --> 28:30.500
- Wait a minute.
- You sit the fuck down, asshole!

28:31.625 --> 28:33.250
- Pimping out young girls. You motherfucker!
- All right, all right.

28:33.417 --> 28:34.417
Mike.

28:34.583 --> 28:36.000
I ought to rip that thing off your chin

28:36.125 --> 28:38.250
- and shove it up your fuckin' ass!
- Mike!

28:39.500 --> 28:42.083
- Don't you look at me like that.
- Levon came in here for a reason.

28:42.250 --> 28:43.583
You're gonna help us
clear some stuff up, right?

28:43.750 --> 28:44.917
Oh, I'm sorry, Levon.

28:45.083 --> 28:46.625
I'm sorry we're stopping you
from your day job as what--

28:46.792 --> 28:48.250
a fuckin' rocket scientist?

28:48.417 --> 28:50.083
Levon here has got a rep on the streets.

28:50.250 --> 28:52.250
He knows what's going on.

28:52.417 --> 28:55.167
I'm gonna ask you a couple questions,
all right?

28:55.292 --> 28:58.417
Why would a killer, after he murdered somebody,
cut into 'em?

28:58.583 --> 29:02.750
I'd assume to send a message,
"Don't fuck with us."

29:03.917 --> 29:06.167
- You're assuming to send a message?
- Yeah, I'm assuming.

29:06.333 --> 29:07.917
Yeah, 'cause you're not that kind of guy.

29:08.283 --> 29:09.292
That's not me.

29:09.458 --> 29:10.583
All right, what about this other guy
I keep hearing about

29:10.750 --> 29:12.708
that you hang out with,
this white guy with the tattoos?

29:12.833 --> 29:14.417
What's his name?

29:16.583 --> 29:18.042
What's his name?

29:20.125 --> 29:21.625
Rule.

29:24.250 --> 29:27.417
Rule Valley. His name is Rule Valley.

29:27.583 --> 29:30.833
- Stay close, all right?
- You know where I'm at.

31:54.250 --> 31:55.783
Oh, my God!

31:57.750 --> 32:02.708
No, no!

32:07.792 --> 32:10.417
No, no!

32:10.583 --> 32:13.583
No, no, no!

32:13.750 --> 32:19.333
No!

32:19.500 --> 32:20.967
No! God!

32:32.250 --> 32:33.267
No!

32:37.458 --> 32:38.867
Hey, come here.

32:42.333 --> 32:44.250
911. What is your emergency?

32:44.417 --> 32:46.667
<i>Help me. A man-- a man in my house.</i>

32:46.792 --> 32:50.000
- Is he still there?
- No. No, he's-- he's outside.

32:50.125 --> 32:53.125
Is your address 3214 Collin Avenue?

32:53.292 --> 32:55.292
Yes. And my baby--

32:55.458 --> 32:56.917
<i>Ma'am, put the baby down...</i>

32:57.083 --> 32:58.917
- Brian.
- and secure all doors and windows.

32:59.083 --> 33:01.750
- Police are on the way.
- <i>Okay.</i> 

33:06.792 --> 33:08.667
Ma'am, do you hear me?

33:08.792 --> 33:10.667
...under attack at this time.
Unknown male assailant.

33:13.333 --> 33:14.917
Oh, no!

33:16.083 --> 33:18.333
Ma'am? Ma'am, hang on.

33:18.458 --> 33:21.167
- The police are on their way.
- <i>Help me! Help me!</i>

33:35.000 --> 33:36.917
Okay, come on.

33:39.625 --> 33:42.917
<i>I'm making a quick path
through the main room and crossing.</i>

33:43.083 --> 33:45.833
- <i>I may just head off in there.</i>
- <i>10-4.</i>

33:58.417 --> 34:00.500
What have we got?

34:00.625 --> 34:03.250
He's got to be nearby.
Check this out.

34:06.292 --> 34:09.750
The bag over there and the street clothes.

34:09.917 --> 34:13.333
Okay, I'll go get K-9 unit.
Leave that bag.

34:31.083 --> 34:35.292
7-Ida-03 in pursuit of suspect,
heading northwest of your location.

34:56.917 --> 34:59.458
- Rawls, Rawls!
- I got him!

35:04.958 --> 35:07.167
- You okay?
- I can't breathe.

35:07.292 --> 35:08.592
We need medical assistance...

35:21.583 --> 35:23.958
I'm telling you,
I was right on that guy's tail.

35:24.125 --> 35:26.500
It was like I got jumped by two guys.

35:27.667 --> 35:29.917
They find my gun?

35:30.083 --> 35:32.417
No, not yet. You ready?

35:34.250 --> 35:36.250
You recognize any of this?

35:39.583 --> 35:40.583
Sorry.

35:40.750 --> 35:42.250
Don't touch. Just point, okay?

35:42.417 --> 35:45.917
Those are mine.
They were on my clothesline.

35:47.417 --> 35:49.083
That's probably how he chose you, okay?

35:49.250 --> 35:51.333
He saw your clothes on that line.

35:51.500 --> 35:53.583
You remember anybody
hanging around your neighborhood,

35:53.750 --> 35:55.833
around your house, your street,
at the mall?

35:56.000 --> 35:57.583
No.

35:59.417 --> 36:01.583
There were two of them.

36:01.750 --> 36:03.667
Say what?

36:03.792 --> 36:05.792
Someone was outside.

36:13.250 --> 36:15.292
Is this your office?

36:17.917 --> 36:20.250
Who can we expect to catch in here?

36:21.583 --> 36:24.042
- Mommy might have to go get Grandma.
- Why?

36:24.167 --> 36:26.583
Well, Grandma and I are gonna go catch
that bad man.

36:26.750 --> 36:28.167
- Why?
- Because the policemen

36:28.333 --> 36:30.792
want to sit in their office
instead of being on the street

36:30.958 --> 36:32.417
looking for the criminal.

36:32.583 --> 36:33.917
Look, I know it's late.

36:34.083 --> 36:36.083
We just need a full description
and a statement.

36:36.250 --> 36:38.417
- That's it.
- See...

36:38.583 --> 36:41.000
- <i>Detective Souder, line 2.</i>
- this is probably how he chose you.

36:41.125 --> 36:43.000
Okay? He saw your clothing--

36:43.167 --> 36:46.583
<i>No! No!</i>

36:46.750 --> 36:48.167
- Come with me.
- Brian.

36:48.333 --> 36:50.000
Okay.

36:50.125 --> 36:51.917
Officer, you take them
into my office right now.

36:52.083 --> 36:54.333
And get Jim Roson.
You call him at home if you have to.

36:54.500 --> 36:56.250
Notify County.

37:02.500 --> 37:04.792
<i>No, please stop!</i>

37:04.958 --> 37:08.750
<i>Please stop!</i>

37:14.917 --> 37:17.083
<i>Can you hear that?</i>

37:35.000 --> 37:37.917
I didn't pray for this girl
while it was happening.

37:41.417 --> 37:43.958
I listened to her die, and it was--

37:45.250 --> 37:47.792
it was like I forgot or something.

38:00.625 --> 38:03.167
You ever wonder why we're here?

38:03.333 --> 38:05.833
Why Texas City?

38:08.125 --> 38:10.500
Well, I know why you're here.

38:18.917 --> 38:21.500
What if I can't stop this one, either?

39:02.833 --> 39:05.000
You ain't gonna like this.

39:05.167 --> 39:09.333
<i>No, please stop! Please stop!</i>

39:20.333 --> 39:23.333
Can you track specifically
where the call originated from?

39:23.500 --> 39:24.833
Yeah, I'm trying, Brian,

39:25.000 --> 39:27.167
but the guy that called you
and your partner last night--

39:27.292 --> 39:28.292
Yeah?

39:28.458 --> 39:30.667
<i>He did it from an area
where we get almost no coverage--</i>

39:30.833 --> 39:33.583
all along those bayous outside Texas City.

39:33.750 --> 39:36.167
- The killing fields?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

39:36.292 --> 39:39.000
You get a connection,
you walk 10 feet and it disappears,

39:39.125 --> 39:40.125
no matter what we try to do.

39:40.292 --> 39:41.917
We gotta bring in
outside construction contractors

39:42.083 --> 39:43.583
'cause our local people won't go in there.

39:43.750 --> 39:45.083
Why not?

39:45.250 --> 39:47.792
<i>Even the Indians who got pushed in there
in the 19th century</i>

39:47.958 --> 39:49.917
<i>turned to cannibalism.</i>

39:50.083 --> 39:52.083
It's-- it's-- I don't know.

39:53.500 --> 39:55.333
It's infected or something.

39:56.292 --> 39:59.833
All right, just keep trying, okay?
Just keep trying.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.792
- I'm gonna do everything I can.
- <i>Thanks, Jim.</i>

40:16.083 --> 40:18.125
I thought you went to hell
if you worked on Sunday.

40:19.292 --> 40:22.000
I needed to get a newspaper.
What are you doing here?

40:22.167 --> 40:25.167
When you go to church,
you don't pray for me, right?

40:25.333 --> 40:27.333
No, I pray for you.

40:27.458 --> 40:30.125
- Don't do it no more.
- Why not?

40:30.292 --> 40:32.500
'Cause everyone you pray for
ends up fuckin' dead.

40:32.625 --> 40:36.083
Oh, am I allowed to say "fuck"
in front of him?

40:36.250 --> 40:38.000
Actually, that one's dead.

40:38.167 --> 40:40.167
That's what I'm talking about.

40:40.333 --> 40:42.792
Mike, what's up?

40:42.958 --> 40:46.417
I need subscribers.
That's all the information.

40:46.583 --> 40:48.458
- Today?
- Yes, please.

40:51.750 --> 40:54.083
You brought her in on a Sunday?

40:54.250 --> 40:57.167
That's Pam's rich kid's
cell phone numbers.

40:58.500 --> 41:00.667
Is the new pope the one
that don't like fags?

41:02.292 --> 41:05.167
What's going on with the phone, Mike?

41:05.333 --> 41:07.083
Okay.

41:07.250 --> 41:10.417
'Cause you're from New York,
I will now try to educate you

41:10.583 --> 41:12.125
about round here.

41:14.583 --> 41:17.167
I got an idea-- why don't you go home
and aggravate your dog?

41:17.333 --> 41:21.458
I don't know if that Laine girl
is alive or dead.

41:21.625 --> 41:24.583
If she is in the fields,

41:24.750 --> 41:26.833
then she is as good as gone.

41:27.000 --> 41:30.917
And it don't matter her family,

41:31.083 --> 41:35.833
money, newspaper people, detectives,

41:35.958 --> 41:37.958
or how much you want to pray...

41:39.750 --> 41:43.125
half of her is probably back
in the food chain.

41:46.083 --> 41:47.917
You have her picture?

42:19.958 --> 42:21.750
This is us--

42:21.917 --> 42:25.583
Texas City, Debbie Mills.

42:25.750 --> 42:27.667
One dead girl,

42:27.833 --> 42:30.333
one unsolved.

42:31.625 --> 42:33.667
This is them--

42:33.833 --> 42:36.833
Clark County, the fields.

42:36.958 --> 42:38.833
It's not our jurisdiction.

43:33.250 --> 43:35.500
- What?
- Hey, that's enough now.

43:35.667 --> 43:39.000
I told you to stay out
when I got the company, baby.

43:40.083 --> 43:42.833
Now, come on. Come on.

43:45.750 --> 43:50.583
You just get your stuff
and get out of here.

43:50.750 --> 43:51.917
Now.

43:53.958 --> 43:56.583
- Fuck you, Russell!
- Hey, what's going on?

43:56.750 --> 43:58.625
I don't know.
One of Mama's boyfriends.

43:58.792 --> 44:01.125
Oh, shit.

44:02.792 --> 44:04.500
Where you going, ladybug?

44:05.750 --> 44:09.083
<i>Ladybug, ladybug, fly away home</i>

44:09.250 --> 44:12.083
<i>The house is on fire
and the kids are all gone</i>

44:12.250 --> 44:14.125
Ladybug!

44:36.125 --> 44:38.458
- $5.50.
- All right.

44:43.167 --> 44:45.083
Wait.

44:54.667 --> 44:56.667
$7.25.

45:01.000 --> 45:02.667
Thank you.

45:04.583 --> 45:06.625
A pack of Reds in the box.

45:24.083 --> 45:26.833
Dad!

45:26.958 --> 45:28.500
Hey, guys.

45:28.667 --> 45:31.792
Sean, this is Anne.

45:31.958 --> 45:34.833
Anne, this is my kids.
This is Coryn.

45:36.083 --> 45:38.417
That's Grandma over there.

45:38.583 --> 45:41.083
- Where's your mom, guys?
- Inside.

45:41.250 --> 45:43.750
Mom, Dad's home!

45:43.917 --> 45:45.792
- Who's this?
- This is Anne.

45:45.958 --> 45:48.250
Anne, this is my wife Gwen.

45:49.500 --> 45:50.917
This is for you.

45:51.083 --> 45:53.792
Well, thank you very much.

45:53.958 --> 45:56.750
Come on. Everybody come on in.

45:58.083 --> 45:59.833
Pass the plates, Mom.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.583
One more meatloaf coming up.

46:01.750 --> 46:04.167
This is our Sunday tradition.

46:04.292 --> 46:05.500
You got it, Mama?

46:05.625 --> 46:08.625
For over 100 years,
ever since the war.

46:10.458 --> 46:13.833
Not today, not today, not today.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.333
- Here's some mashed potatoes.
- You take some of that.

46:16.500 --> 46:19.958
That's right, hooves,
or it can chews the 'could.'

46:20.125 --> 46:23.583
My question is, "What is the could?"
Everybody get this.

46:23.750 --> 46:26.083
- What is the could?
- The could.

46:27.250 --> 46:30.083
Hold on, I'll get the phone.

46:35.083 --> 46:36.333
Hello?

46:36.500 --> 46:38.958
Honey, it's Pam.

46:44.583 --> 46:47.917
- It's okay. I'll take her home.
- Mommy.

46:58.500 --> 47:00.083
You good?

47:00.250 --> 47:02.083
I'll be right back, okay?

47:02.250 --> 47:04.250
You doin' all right, son?

47:15.667 --> 47:18.250
The boy found the body
when he was walking his dog.

47:18.417 --> 47:21.292
I left a message for Mike
on his cell phone.

47:21.458 --> 47:24.167
Yep, left about 15 messages.

47:24.333 --> 47:26.292
- Haven't heard from him?
- I learned on our honeymoon,

47:26.458 --> 47:29.292
never call Mike after 2:00
in the afternoon on a weekend.

47:37.792 --> 47:39.792
This ain't good, Bri.

47:43.292 --> 47:45.792
- Is it Kirsten Laine?
- Yeah, it is.

47:48.625 --> 47:50.625
They took her hands.

47:59.292 --> 48:01.792
Her dress is buttoned up wrong.

48:01.958 --> 48:04.500
Somebody put that dress back on her.

48:04.667 --> 48:06.625
You see the cause of death?

48:07.792 --> 48:09.292
Not yet.

48:09.458 --> 48:11.458
We got to get her out of here.

48:16.167 --> 48:18.125
I got something here.

48:23.583 --> 48:25.125
Pam, I got a print.

48:27.958 --> 48:29.250
Damn it.

48:36.458 --> 48:37.458
Come on.

48:39.767 --> 48:40.833
Pull her out.

48:41.458 --> 48:42.625
God damn it!

48:44.792 --> 48:47.500
Good. You got it?
You still got it?

48:48.958 --> 48:51.458
Oh, God!

48:53.083 --> 48:55.625
- No. Damn it! Damn it.
- God!

49:03.292 --> 49:05.458
Here, here.

49:09.625 --> 49:11.500
God damn.

49:17.417 --> 49:19.292
Here.

49:23.292 --> 49:25.417
Why don't you answer your phone
once in a while, Detective?

49:25.583 --> 49:27.917
You got 30 cops, you got feds,

49:28.083 --> 49:30.958
a fuckin' helicopter,
you got my fuckin' partner part time!

49:31.125 --> 49:33.125
What the hell else you want?

49:40.458 --> 49:42.667
I pulled Levon's rap sheet.
You get a chance to read it?

49:45.792 --> 49:48.125
You got rape, kidnapping, assault.

49:49.667 --> 49:52.458
You got two guys with priors.

49:54.125 --> 49:55.833
It goes right to them.

50:00.792 --> 50:02.958
Our beat is Texas City.

50:03.125 --> 50:07.333
I don't want to be here.
You don't belong here.

50:11.750 --> 50:14.167
What if this is the girl we heard?

50:16.125 --> 50:19.958
She was down and bound

50:20.125 --> 50:22.125
here in this place.

50:22.292 --> 50:24.583
And somebody took the time
to pick up their cell phone

50:24.750 --> 50:26.792
and dial a number.

50:26.958 --> 50:30.250
You know whose fucking number
they dialed, Mike?

50:30.417 --> 50:32.833
That was yours and mine.

52:43.417 --> 52:45.833
We're in there the other night
and there's no women there

52:46.000 --> 52:48.750
and it's just dudes,
and they're all from North Carolina.

52:48.917 --> 52:50.625
How'd you know they all
from North Carolina?

52:50.792 --> 52:53.625
Well, they know Sparta,
Winston-Salem, Boone.

52:53.792 --> 52:57.083
So anyway, there's no women there.
So I said, "Let's play cricket."

52:57.250 --> 52:59.792
Cricket? Ain't no cricket in North Carolina.

52:59.958 --> 53:02.417
Oh, yes, there is.

53:02.583 --> 53:04.500
Cricket's a game they play in England.

53:04.667 --> 53:08.583
You gotta be rich or a fag to play it.

53:08.750 --> 53:11.000
I'm talkin' crickets and darts, man.
Come on.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.167
Then you should have said "darts."

53:18.958 --> 53:21.625
You know what I mean, though--
you gotta cancel out the 20s;

53:21.792 --> 53:24.667
you cancel out the 19s;
you cancel out the 18s.

53:24.833 --> 53:27.667
So, anyway, we're waiting
on them whores, and Brett--

53:27.792 --> 53:29.833
Don't say "whores" in front
of your little sister.

53:31.458 --> 53:34.167
They don't come inside
till around 11:00,

53:34.333 --> 53:36.333
after the last shift.

53:41.333 --> 53:45.167
You know, it's none of your business
what I say in front of my little sister.

53:45.333 --> 53:46.333
Hey. hey!

53:47.625 --> 53:48.792
Hey!

53:52.333 --> 53:55.333
How about I choke your fuckin'
lights out? Huh?

53:58.625 --> 54:01.333
You dumb little bastard.

54:06.500 --> 54:08.083
Should I get out and get her?

54:10.250 --> 54:12.583
She's just gonna run on you.

54:34.833 --> 54:37.417
<i>Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
how I wonder where you are</i>

54:37.583 --> 54:41.125
<i>Up above the world so high,
like a diamond in the sky</i>

54:41.292 --> 54:43.458
<i>Twinkle, twinkle, little star...</i>

54:51.792 --> 54:53.167
What does he want?

54:54.417 --> 54:56.500
You're not back working the streets,
are you, Lady Worm?

54:56.667 --> 54:58.958
I gave that up a long time ago,
Officer Cracker.

55:00.750 --> 55:03.000
- So you're an upstanding citizen?
- Mm-hmm, that's right.

55:03.167 --> 55:05.500
All right. Then, uh...

55:05.667 --> 55:08.083
you wouldn't mind telling me
about the white guy

55:08.250 --> 55:09.750
with the green Pontiac.

55:09.917 --> 55:13.417
- You got a warrant?
- Just open the damn door.

55:18.625 --> 55:21.458
It's none of your damn business
what's in here

55:28.458 --> 55:30.458
No plates on this.

55:31.458 --> 55:33.250
White guy took them off,
then parked it here.

55:34.958 --> 55:37.958
- And how long has it been here?
- Two days.

55:38.125 --> 55:40.083
- Is he paying you?
- No.

55:40.250 --> 55:43.500
- No?
- You stupid? I said no.

55:43.625 --> 55:46.125
I ain't crazy.
I ain't asking him for no money.

55:46.292 --> 55:48.000
'Cause I don't want to have
to run you in as an accessory.

55:48.125 --> 55:49.625
Detective, you wouldn't
be talking to me that way

55:49.792 --> 55:50.958
if we was in a white neighborhood.

55:51.125 --> 55:52.292
Why do you say that?

55:52.458 --> 55:54.917
It means I don't see you
living on my street after work.

55:55.083 --> 55:57.958
And you damn sure ain't gonna
let me sleep where you live.

55:59.625 --> 56:02.000
Go sit on the curb
and don't go nowhere.

56:40.458 --> 56:44.333
- This all for the Laine girl?
- Yeah.

56:48.792 --> 56:50.458
Where are we headed?

56:50.625 --> 56:53.250
Poachers' bar, near the fields.

56:59.625 --> 57:01.958
Don't touch that. Let me get it.

57:32.417 --> 57:35.333
Might be. Need to thaw it out.

57:35.458 --> 57:37.833
Missing a ring finger?

57:38.958 --> 57:40.667
All right, here.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.917
I'm gonna need gas and restaurant receipts
for the last four days.

57:49.083 --> 57:51.833
Did I say something funny?

57:51.958 --> 57:53.500
Come on, darling.

57:53.667 --> 57:57.125
Why don't you introduce us
to the boys who found the hand?

58:25.583 --> 58:27.333
I tried.

58:40.500 --> 58:44.625
I'm Detective Heigh,
Texas City Police Department.

58:44.792 --> 58:47.125
Which one of you found the hand?

58:47.292 --> 58:48.917
Me.

58:50.125 --> 58:51.750
What about you?

58:51.917 --> 58:53.625
I wasn't there.

58:53.792 --> 58:55.792
What's your name?

58:56.958 --> 58:58.458
Frank.

59:00.458 --> 59:02.792
All right, Frank.

59:04.250 --> 59:06.958
I'm gonna need that ring back.

59:07.125 --> 59:09.125
What ring?

59:11.125 --> 59:13.500
I'm gonna need that ring back.

59:15.500 --> 59:17.792
So, is this the gratitude we get

59:17.958 --> 59:20.458
for giving you guys a hand?

59:26.833 --> 59:27.858
Hey!

59:31.917 --> 59:34.958
Stop it! Down!
Get the fuck down!

59:36.917 --> 59:38.833
Get down!

59:40.500 --> 59:43.292
Get the fuck down!

59:47.625 --> 59:50.083
Bri, we're good.

59:51.450 --> 59:52.417
Bri!

59:52.583 --> 59:54.000
Enough!

59:54.125 --> 59:55.667
Bri, stop.

59:57.583 --> 59:59.292
Brian, enough!

01:00:00.458 --> 01:00:01.458
Brian!

01:00:01.625 --> 01:00:03.625
Enough!

01:00:06.417 --> 01:00:08.792
Brian!

01:00:12.458 --> 01:00:14.458
Where'd you find it?

01:00:17.792 --> 01:00:19.167
I'm gonna get a map,
and you're gonna show me

01:00:19.333 --> 01:00:21.333
goddamn exactly where it is.

01:00:36.625 --> 01:00:40.000
- I ain't seen you in years, boy.
- Mm-hmm.

01:00:41.417 --> 01:00:44.000
You're an important person now, huh?

01:00:44.167 --> 01:00:46.667
You used to come over here
a lot with your daddy.

01:00:46.833 --> 01:00:49.750
Oh, yeah, I remember
when he made me hang around

01:00:49.917 --> 01:00:54.625
while-- while you and the rest
of the bums-- remember?

01:00:54.792 --> 01:00:58.292
You just drank as much alcohol
as y'all could

01:00:58.458 --> 01:00:59.567
and then--

01:01:00.292 --> 01:01:01.792
and then y'all would vomit
all over each other.

01:01:01.958 --> 01:01:04.625
- Shit, you remember that night?
- Yeah.

01:01:04.792 --> 01:01:08.083
First guy pukes, and then all the rest
go at the same time,

01:01:08.250 --> 01:01:10.625
- all over that damn card game.
- Mm-hmm.

01:01:10.792 --> 01:01:12.625
You got to drive 'em home, though.

01:01:12.792 --> 01:01:15.167
You was, what? 11 or 12?

01:01:15.292 --> 01:01:16.958
11.

01:01:18.792 --> 01:01:21.417
Yeah, I was 11.

01:01:21.583 --> 01:01:25.000
Next time you don't answer
my partner's questions,

01:01:25.125 --> 01:01:28.417
I'm gonna take your peace officer's license

01:01:28.583 --> 01:01:30.958
and I'm gonna shove it up your ass.

01:01:34.958 --> 01:01:37.292
You say hi to Nancy for me.

01:01:42.625 --> 01:01:45.583
- Will these do?
- Yeah.

01:01:52.533 --> 01:01:54.592
So, Levon and Rule

01:01:54.958 --> 01:01:57.792
stashed the car in Lady Worm's garage.

01:01:58.792 --> 01:02:03.458
There's blood spatters.
There's a potential murder weapon.

01:02:03.625 --> 01:02:05.625
It's the works.

01:02:05.792 --> 01:02:08.000
The DNA's a match for Debbie Mills.

01:02:08.167 --> 01:02:11.125
The judge issued warrants.
We'll pick 'em up on site.

01:02:12.667 --> 01:02:14.167
Yeah.

01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:21.333
You know--

01:02:21.458 --> 01:02:23.333
you know, I wish I'd seen all this.

01:02:23.458 --> 01:02:25.083
What were you thinking?

01:02:25.250 --> 01:02:28.167
Huh? Were you thinking,
"I'm a big New York gorilla"?

01:02:28.292 --> 01:02:29.792
- Thinking, "I'm a big tough guy..."
- Go away, Mike.

01:02:29.958 --> 01:02:30.958
"Getting all tough on those small-town fish"?

01:02:31.125 --> 01:02:33.000
Was I talking to you?

01:02:39.458 --> 01:02:42.833
Go on.

01:02:46.833 --> 01:02:49.458
You don't know
how close to the edge you are.

01:02:51.917 --> 01:02:54.792
You belong with Levon and Rule

01:02:54.958 --> 01:02:57.750
in Texas City with me.

01:02:57.917 --> 01:03:01.125
You don't know where you are
right here.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.500
This place-- this place
is nothing but chaos.

01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:11.250
Your God don't even come here.

01:03:13.125 --> 01:03:15.833
You don't know where you are
right here.

01:03:21.125 --> 01:03:23.458
I know exactly where I am.

01:03:50.792 --> 01:03:52.167
See the red?

01:03:52.333 --> 01:03:55.125
That's the first call to 911
from that woman Lila.

01:03:55.292 --> 01:03:56.667
The assailant's the background voice

01:03:56.792 --> 01:03:59.458
Now, the blue--

01:03:59.625 --> 01:04:02.125
that's the call that came in later
on your office phone.

01:04:02.292 --> 01:04:04.667
See? They match.

01:04:04.792 --> 01:04:07.125
All right, where'd the second call
come from?

01:04:10.250 --> 01:04:11.833
- The fields.
- Yeah.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.333
And he's using a cell--
someone else's.

01:04:15.458 --> 01:04:18.750
A-- someone called...

01:04:20.125 --> 01:04:21.792
Kirsten Laine.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.625
He's using her cell.

01:04:28.792 --> 01:04:31.958
He wants us to know
he can use her cell.

01:04:32.125 --> 01:04:34.833
All right, how much coverage
can you get on this number?

01:04:37.167 --> 01:04:38.292
I need your help.

01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:41.792
I need you to get me up
on that girl's cell phone, okay?

01:04:56.500 --> 01:05:00.083
She got caught trying to sell
a driver's license at school.

01:05:00.250 --> 01:05:01.792
Had your card on her.

01:05:05.958 --> 01:05:09.792
Can't you just go home and watch TV
like other kids? Can you do that?

01:05:09.958 --> 01:05:12.625
- Yeah.
- Then get out of here. Go do it.

01:05:21.917 --> 01:05:25.625
Look, what did I do? Huh?

01:05:25.792 --> 01:05:28.292
What did I do?

01:05:41.125 --> 01:05:43.625
You know you're never alone?

01:05:43.792 --> 01:05:46.583
There's always someone
looking out for you.

01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:50.292
Now, who's that, hmm? God?

01:05:52.292 --> 01:05:55.167
Now, you see, God's too busy for me.

01:05:55.292 --> 01:05:56.750
I figured it out.

01:05:56.917 --> 01:05:59.250
Everybody's always, you know,
busting his balls all the time--

01:05:59.417 --> 01:06:02.167
you know, "Give me this. I want that."

01:06:02.292 --> 01:06:04.500
He ain't got time for little people.

01:06:05.792 --> 01:06:07.167
Not me.

01:06:08.583 --> 01:06:10.292
Is that what you think?

01:06:19.658 --> 01:06:20.750
You all right?

01:06:20.917 --> 01:06:23.333
Yeah.

01:06:29.125 --> 01:06:31.458
Why don't you run in

01:06:31.625 --> 01:06:34.500
and get some of that milk
of magnesia stuff?

01:06:34.667 --> 01:06:36.750
Here, let me give you some money.

01:06:37.833 --> 01:06:40.000
I'm gonna stay here
and make a phone call, okay?

01:06:40.167 --> 01:06:42.167
- Yeah.
- I'll be waiting for you.

01:06:52.667 --> 01:06:55.792
Jim, it's Brian.

01:06:55.958 --> 01:06:58.625
Jim, no, I just want to know
when the line is up.

01:07:00.458 --> 01:07:02.167
All right. Will you let me know
as soon as you are?

01:07:22.792 --> 01:07:24.500
Pam, its Brian.

01:07:28.458 --> 01:07:31.167
You get any prints off what we found?

01:07:32.792 --> 01:07:35.792
All right. All right, bye.

01:07:51.792 --> 01:07:53.792
Excuse me.
A little girl just came in here.

01:07:53.958 --> 01:07:55.250
- Did you see her?
- I don't know.

01:07:55.417 --> 01:07:57.625
- I heard some kids fighting.
- Anne?

01:07:57.792 --> 01:08:00.167
Might be in the bathroom in the back.

01:08:00.333 --> 01:08:01.583
Anne?

01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:04.958
- Your security cameras up?
- Haven't worked in weeks.

01:08:08.333 --> 01:08:10.083
Anne?

01:08:19.125 --> 01:08:20.625
Anne!

01:08:28.917 --> 01:08:31.667
06 to base, I got a possible abduction
at a Jim's Convenience Store.

01:08:31.792 --> 01:08:33.792
Will you send some cars?

01:09:40.457 --> 01:09:44.082
<i>Base to 7-Ida-07.</i>

01:09:44.250 --> 01:09:45.250
Go ahead, base.

01:09:45.417 --> 01:09:47.750
We can't raise 06.

01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:50.000
Just try Brian at his residence.

01:09:50.167 --> 01:09:52.457
Tell him we're set up at the garage.

01:10:03.792 --> 01:10:06.167
<i>7-Ida-03 to 7-Ida-07.</i>

01:10:06.333 --> 01:10:08.458
03, go ahead.

01:10:08.625 --> 01:10:10.000
Yeah, we got a green Pontiac
doing the block here.

01:10:10.167 --> 01:10:11.792
He's been by us three times already.

01:10:11.958 --> 01:10:14.583
- All right, give me the plate.
- <i>It's not our guy, 07.</i>

01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:19.500
It is Texas 89 Juliet Romeo 623.

01:10:19.667 --> 01:10:21.625
<i>They've left the area.</i>

01:10:21.792 --> 01:10:24.667
Is that thing decked out
with custom wheels and dent in the rear?

01:10:24.833 --> 01:10:26.250
<i>10-4.</i>

01:10:26.417 --> 01:10:27.833
Well, they just changed the plates.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.625
All units, our boys are gonna be
back in the hood.

01:10:40.583 --> 01:10:43.500
<i>7-Ida-07, 10-4.
They're back on the set.</i>

01:10:47.292 --> 01:10:50.000
<i>07 to all units,
just stand by for my signal.</i>

01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:47.083
<i>Leave a message.</i>

01:11:48.150 --> 01:11:49.167
Mike?

01:11:50.458 --> 01:11:53.625
I think they snatched Little Anne.
I need you and your dog out here.

01:11:53.792 --> 01:11:55.167
I'm midway between
the Taylor crime scene

01:11:55.292 --> 01:11:56.792
and the poachers' camp.

01:11:56.958 --> 01:11:58.333
Damn it.

01:12:14.833 --> 01:12:17.458
Base, I need you to raise my partner.

01:12:17.625 --> 01:12:20.125
Base to 7-Ida-06.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.083
Base to 7-Ida-06.

01:12:25.458 --> 01:12:28.958
Base to 7-Ida-07; 06 not responding.

01:12:36.167 --> 01:12:39.667
I want them to enter the garage
before we take them.

01:12:44.625 --> 01:12:48.458
- Is that one of our two ladies?
- Yeah. It's the old one, I think.

01:12:48.625 --> 01:12:51.000
<i>She's heading east,
coming your way.</i>

01:12:51.167 --> 01:12:53.125
07 to 03, what's her 20?

01:12:53.292 --> 01:12:55.792
<i>03 to 07, passing by your location</i>

01:12:55.958 --> 01:12:58.500
<i>with a shopping bag right now.</i>

01:13:45.625 --> 01:13:47.500
- Ow, ow!
- Stay down.

01:13:47.667 --> 01:13:49.083
It's okay. Help's coming.

01:13:49.250 --> 01:13:51.500
- My legs! Look at my legs!
- Stay calm. Look at me.

01:13:51.667 --> 01:13:53.958
Stay calm.

01:13:54.125 --> 01:13:57.167
Sheila! There-- that driver, that car!

01:13:57.333 --> 01:14:00.250
07 to all units,
suspect's vehicle has hostage.

01:14:00.417 --> 01:14:02.583
I got a civilian with burns.

01:14:07.958 --> 01:14:09.500
Come on, get here!

01:14:09.667 --> 01:14:11.917
- Stay here. It's okay, I'm here.
- Help me. Help me.

01:14:12.083 --> 01:14:14.000
Deal with her!

01:14:26.792 --> 01:14:30.625
- Let me the fuck out!
- Shut the fuck up, bitch. Shut up!

01:14:32.125 --> 01:14:34.833
07 in pursuit, green Pontiac!

01:14:58.750 --> 01:15:00.292
Get off my ass!

01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:21.458
Shit!

01:15:22.625 --> 01:15:24.583
- What the fuck is this shit?
- I got this shit.

01:15:24.750 --> 01:15:28.292
What the fuck? We got shit.
Get back in the fuckin' car, man.

01:15:29.058 --> 01:15:30.583
What the fuck are you doing?

01:15:35.458 --> 01:15:37.750
This is motherfuckin' bad.

01:15:45.792 --> 01:15:46.625
Fuck.

01:15:48.958 --> 01:15:50.458
Motherfucker.

01:16:25.833 --> 01:16:28.667
<i>Mike, listen,
I think they snatched Little Anne.</i>

01:16:28.833 --> 01:16:30.125
<i>I need you and your dog out here.</i>

01:16:30.292 --> 01:16:31.750
<i>I'm midway between
the Taylor crime scene</i>

01:16:31.917 --> 01:16:33.417
<i>and the poachers' camp.</i>

01:16:39.625 --> 01:16:41.625
Hey!

01:16:46.625 --> 01:16:49.917
I had her at a convenience store.

01:16:50.083 --> 01:16:52.583
She didn't come back out.

01:16:52.750 --> 01:16:54.958
I went in-- signs of a struggle.

01:16:55.958 --> 01:16:59.000
Phone company says this is where

01:16:59.167 --> 01:17:01.125
the phone call to us originated from.

01:17:03.125 --> 01:17:05.792
So, I come from the biggest clusterfuck
of my career

01:17:05.958 --> 01:17:08.458
to come look at a map and mud.

01:17:11.083 --> 01:17:13.000
The body was found right over there.

01:17:15.125 --> 01:17:17.292
This is where Pam found the latest girl.

01:17:17.458 --> 01:17:20.833
These are other body recovery sites.

01:17:22.458 --> 01:17:24.958
This bayou we're standing in right now

01:17:25.125 --> 01:17:27.125
connects every single one
of those sites.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.958
It's right here.

01:17:50.958 --> 01:17:52.292
I'm in this shit, too.

01:17:52.458 --> 01:17:54.625
Yeah, you be Big Billy Badass.
That don't make you hard.

01:17:54.792 --> 01:17:56.000
You still be a bitch in my book.

01:17:56.167 --> 01:17:58.000
That's not what I'm trying to say, nigga.

01:17:58.167 --> 01:17:59.583
Then what you saying?

01:17:59.750 --> 01:18:02.917
You don't shoot no laws.
You gotta discriminate.

01:18:03.083 --> 01:18:05.458
I do whatever the fuck I want.

01:18:06.958 --> 01:18:10.125
I even do you like that,
you get in my way.

01:18:10.292 --> 01:18:12.292
You'd pull a gun on me?

01:18:12.458 --> 01:18:14.625
That's it-- our friendship
just died right then.

01:18:17.625 --> 01:18:19.500
Get your toy, "nigga".

01:18:43.458 --> 01:18:45.958
See, you hard, you pull that trigger.

01:19:59.792 --> 01:20:01.667
Brian.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.125
Brian, over here.

01:20:13.625 --> 01:20:15.625
She's alive, she's alive.
I've got a pulse.

01:20:15.792 --> 01:20:19.000
It's okay, it's okay.
We'll get you out of here.

01:20:21.125 --> 01:20:24.000
- God damn it.
- Hang in there, hang in there.

01:20:25.333 --> 01:20:27.500
- Go, go.
- All right.

01:20:32.317 --> 01:20:33.533
Come on!

01:20:55.292 --> 01:20:57.083
- There we go.
- Get her out of here.

01:20:57.250 --> 01:20:59.958
Brian, don't do nothing stupid.

01:21:03.792 --> 01:21:06.000
- Now, we got two fugitives.
- They kept her alive,

01:21:06.167 --> 01:21:07.583
- 'cause they're coming back for her.
- No!

01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:10.083
Get out of my way! Damn it.

01:21:10.250 --> 01:21:12.458
- What do I tell Gwen?
- She already knows.

01:21:12.625 --> 01:21:14.833
Come on, Lee.

01:22:09.125 --> 01:22:10.192
Alex!

01:22:11.458 --> 01:22:13.250
Stay here with the ambulance.
I'm going up ahead.

01:22:13.417 --> 01:22:15.625
- I want an update in 15.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:22:28.833 --> 01:22:30.417
Where? Where am I going?

01:22:30.583 --> 01:22:32.583
He's here. Follow this bayou.

01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:34.167
- All right.
- Okay?

01:22:34.333 --> 01:22:37.125
That fucking idiot took our dog.

01:22:40.750 --> 01:22:42.250
My dog.

01:22:43.333 --> 01:22:45.333
My dog.

01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:27.417
Put your hands above your head.

01:23:32.292 --> 01:23:34.500
Get down on your knees.

01:23:36.125 --> 01:23:38.625
I said get down on your goddamn knees.

01:24:00.158 --> 01:24:02.258
Go! Go!

01:24:02.625 --> 01:24:03.500
Go!

01:24:13.667 --> 01:24:16.458
- Yeah?
- <i>He's dead.</i>

01:24:21.083 --> 01:24:22.958
Who's dead? Who is this?

01:24:29.292 --> 01:24:31.958
- He said he's dead.
- He said Brian's dead?

01:24:33.225 --> 01:24:34.667
- I think so.
- You think so?

01:24:36.792 --> 01:24:39.250
Task force 3 to all units,
prepare to copy.

01:24:39.417 --> 01:24:41.958
Just received unknown caller,
said 06 dead.

01:24:42.125 --> 01:24:43.500
Repeat, said 06 dead.

01:24:43.667 --> 01:24:45.792
- No further information.
- It's Brian's phone.

01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:51.917
Yeah, hello?

01:24:52.083 --> 01:24:55.625
<i>Brian, he just called your partner
He said somebody's dead.</i>

01:24:55.792 --> 01:24:56.958
Who is this?

01:24:59.083 --> 01:25:00.458
Who am I talking to?

01:25:00.625 --> 01:25:02.792
I'm Brian's partner.
Who the fuck are you?

01:25:02.958 --> 01:25:04.750
<i>How did you know I got a call?</i>

01:25:04.917 --> 01:25:06.292
<i>If you don't give me the right answer,</i>

01:25:06.458 --> 01:25:08.667
I'm gonna come fuckin' over there
and find you.

01:25:08.833 --> 01:25:11.167
The guy's using Kirsten Laine's cell phone.

01:25:12.292 --> 01:25:14.458
You're up on the girl's cell phone?

01:25:14.625 --> 01:25:16.417
<i>Yes.</i>

01:25:16.583 --> 01:25:18.917
Where'd the call originate from?

01:25:19.083 --> 01:25:21.250
It came from the tower
on the west side,

01:25:21.417 --> 01:25:23.250
<i>near the old bridge.</i>

01:25:24.792 --> 01:25:26.292
Okay.

01:25:27.792 --> 01:25:31.167
Okay, you call me
if he uses it again. You hear?

01:25:35.958 --> 01:25:38.792
He said the killer's using
the victim's cell phone.

01:25:40.167 --> 01:25:42.500
Near that bridge.

01:25:42.667 --> 01:25:44.792
Lucie's place.

01:25:44.958 --> 01:25:47.083
Fuckin' knew it!

01:25:47.250 --> 01:25:49.333
I knew it.

01:26:14.125 --> 01:26:16.292
Take 'em.

01:26:20.958 --> 01:26:22.792
Go.

01:26:38.083 --> 01:26:40.125
- Check this out, right here.
- Wait. Shh.

01:26:44.058 --> 01:26:45.258
This way!

01:28:03.125 --> 01:28:04.958
Give me the girl's phone number.

01:28:05.125 --> 01:28:09.625
It's, uh, 587...

01:28:09.792 --> 01:28:12.292
2288.

01:28:53.625 --> 01:28:56.083
- You seen your sister?
- No.

01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:07.958
Give me that.

01:29:08.125 --> 01:29:09.500
Who's this?

01:29:09.625 --> 01:29:12.292
- <i>Put Lucie on the phone.</i>
- What?

01:29:12.458 --> 01:29:15.125
Put Lucie on the phone.

01:29:15.292 --> 01:29:17.458
You asshole.

01:29:17.625 --> 01:29:19.000
- He's out there.
- What'd he say?

01:29:19.167 --> 01:29:22.125
- Who?
- He wants to speak to her.

01:29:22.292 --> 01:29:23.625
Why Ma?

01:29:23.792 --> 01:29:26.292
- Who wants to talk to me?
- Where's the keys?

01:29:38.958 --> 01:29:42.500
Where are we going?
You want me to pack my bag?

01:29:42.667 --> 01:29:44.250

- What's going on, you guys?
- Where's the keys?

01:30:00.958 --> 01:30:04.500
Rhino? Rhino, where are we going, man?

01:30:05.958 --> 01:30:06.958
<i>Hello?</i>

01:30:07.125 --> 01:30:10.250
- Ask 'em what they did to Little Anne.
- What?

01:30:10.417 --> 01:30:12.417
Ask 'em what they did to your daughter.

01:30:13.458 --> 01:30:17.333
Some-- somebody said,
"Ask them what they did to your daughter."

01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:19.500
I didn't do nothing. Rhino--

01:30:19.667 --> 01:30:22.667
- He killed a goddamn cop.
- Well, I had to.

01:30:22.833 --> 01:30:25.167
This-- this guy said, "Ask them--"

01:30:25.333 --> 01:30:27.125
- Who-- who--
- Ma.

01:30:27.292 --> 01:30:29.292
He killed Little Anne.

01:30:30.417 --> 01:30:31.833
Ma, she's gone.

01:30:40.417 --> 01:30:42.417
What are you saying?

01:30:43.583 --> 01:30:45.500
I'm sorry.

01:30:49.833 --> 01:30:52.958
Little Anne-- she ain't coming back.

01:30:53.125 --> 01:30:55.500
She-- that's my baby.

01:30:55.625 --> 01:30:57.292
He said she made the cops come around.

01:30:57.458 --> 01:30:59.250
- That's my little baby!
- And he made me go with him,

01:30:59.417 --> 01:31:02.417
- but he did all the killing.
- That's my little baby!

01:31:02.583 --> 01:31:05.417
He made me, Ma!

01:31:05.583 --> 01:31:08.083
Don't touch me!
That is my baby!

01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:09.625
He made me.

01:31:14.250 --> 01:31:15.500
Damn it.

01:31:30.792 --> 01:31:32.292

We got him!

01:35:41.792 --> 01:35:45.583
- Don't you want to look?
- No.

01:36:52.292 --> 01:36:54.292
Anne?

01:36:56.792 --> 01:36:58.500
Anne?

01:37:04.750 --> 01:37:06.500

<i>Away up the stair</i>

01:42:00.458 --> 01:42:04.417
<i>Mammy heard him holler,

01:42:04.583 --> 01:42:06.500
<i>When they turned the covers down</i>

01:42:06.667 --> 01:42:09.500
<i>He wasn't there at all</i>

01:42:09.667 --> 01:42:12.000
<i>They seeked him in the rafter room</i>

01:42:12.167 --> 01:42:14.083

<i>And she said she didn't care</i>

01:42:50.292 --> 01:42:54.458
<i>Then she kicked her heels,
turned to run and hide</i>

01:42:54.625 --> 01:42:56.792
<i>There was two great black things</i>

01:42:56.958 --> 01:42:58.958
<i>Standing by her side</i>

01:42:59.125 --> 01:43:00.625

<i>And the lamp-wick sputters</i>

01:43:18.500 --> 01:43:20.333
<i>And the wind goes woo</i>

01:43:20.458 --> 01:43:24.833
