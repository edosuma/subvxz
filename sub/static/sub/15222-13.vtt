00:01.401 --> 00:05.667
<i>Theorizing that one could time travel
within his own lifetime,</i>

00:05.739 --> 00:08.674
<i>Dr. Sam Beckett stepped
into the Quantum Leap accelerator...</i>

00:08.742 --> 00:10.733
<i>and vanished.</i>

00:16.015 --> 00:18.678
<i>He awoke to find himself
trapped in the past,</i>

00:18.752 --> 00:21.550
<i>facing mirror images
that were not his own...</i>

00:21.621 --> 00:26.854
<i>and driven by an unknown force
to change history for the better.</i>

00:26.926 --> 00:32.192
<i>His only guide on this journey is Al,
an observer from his own time,</i>

00:32.265 --> 00:36.634
<i>who appears in the form of a hologram
that only Sam can see and hear.</i>

00:36.703 --> 00:42.369
<i>And so, Dr. Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,</i>

00:42.442 --> 00:44.910
<i>striving to put right
what once went wrong...</i>

00:44.978 --> 00:47.503
<i>and hoping each time
that his next leap...</i>

00:47.580 --> 00:49.571
<i>will be the leap home.</i>

00:51.051 --> 00:53.815
<i>Come on, sister.!</i>

00:56.556 --> 01:00.822
We are here tonight not because
we want more rights than men have...

01:00.894 --> 01:05.991
<i>but because we want
the same rights men have.</i>

01:06.066 --> 01:09.126
I'm asking you to take a stand.

01:09.202 --> 01:13.104
<i>Show them that we are not gonna take
it anymore.! I'm asking you to burn it.</i>

01:13.173 --> 01:15.903
<i>Burn it for liberation now.!
Do it! Just do it!</i>

01:23.583 --> 01:26.677
<i>Liberation now.! Liberation now.!</i>

01:26.753 --> 01:29.187
Liberation now!
Oh, boy.

Liberation now! Liberation now!

02:49.936 --> 02:51.961
Liberation now!

02:52.038 --> 02:56.737
Liberation now! Liberation now!
Liberation now!

02:56.809 --> 02:59.039
All right. All right.
Listen- Listen-

02:59.112 --> 03:01.046
<i>Liberation now.
Listen, please.</i>

03:01.114 --> 03:03.014
Full name and correct spelling.

03:03.082 --> 03:05.141
I'm not sure.

03:05.218 --> 03:07.914
You're not sure you wanna be
identified with this crowd, huh? Okay.

03:07.987 --> 03:11.115
I can go with
"unidentified protestor. "

03:11.191 --> 03:13.455
Souvenir?

03:13.526 --> 03:16.017
<i>All right!</i>

03:20.099 --> 03:24.365
The same rights that have allowed them
a better education,

03:24.437 --> 03:27.634
a better job, a better choice.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.677
We have the right to equality...

03:31.744 --> 03:35.942
because we are human beings
just like they are.

03:36.015 --> 03:39.473
We have the same blood
and the same skin...

03:39.552 --> 03:43.488
<i>and the same bones
and the same hair that they have.</i>

03:43.556 --> 03:48.118
We stand here tonight for our rights,

03:48.194 --> 03:50.594
for our human rights!

03:52.932 --> 03:55.162
<i>I don't want a female-dominated society...</i>

03:55.235 --> 03:59.501
any more than I want
a male-dominated society.

04:00.974 --> 04:04.307
You can dominate me anytime, honey!

04:04.377 --> 04:08.336
<i>We must sever the chains that tie us
to the traditional roles...</i>

04:08.414 --> 04:11.611
<i>which have subjugated women
for too long. Oh, yeah, yeah.</i>

04:11.684 --> 04:13.777
We know what you want to sever.
Ooh!

04:15.154 --> 04:17.678
Penis envy is a male fallacy...

04:17.757 --> 04:21.523
<i>created by men for men...</i>

04:21.594 --> 04:26.156
<i>as an attempt to undermine
our own sense of power.</i>

04:26.232 --> 04:28.666
Somebody dump the trash.
Dump the trash.

04:28.735 --> 04:33.297
I think maybe we should get out of here
now, all right? Mom, we can't leave now.

04:33.373 --> 04:38.640
You have a right to stay single
without being pitied or ridiculed.

04:38.711 --> 04:42.010
<i>You have a right to have children or not.</i>

04:42.081 --> 04:46.916
You have the right
and the power to decide!

04:46.986 --> 04:50.649
Power my butt!

04:50.723 --> 04:55.023
<i>You're all wimps. Why don't you go home where
you belong, in the kitchen? In the kitchen.!</i>

04:55.094 --> 04:57.028
You're the wimp because...

04:57.096 --> 05:01.294
you never bothered to develop the muscle
that's rotting between your ears.

05:01.367 --> 05:04.495
<i>Get outta here.</i>

05:07.073 --> 05:10.907
<i>This is an illegal assembly.
Disperse immediately.</i>

05:10.977 --> 05:15.038
<i>Everyone leave the area.
Take it easy, will ya?</i>

05:15.114 --> 05:17.810
<i>If you do not,
you'll be arrested.</i>

05:19.152 --> 05:23.782
<i>This is an illegal assembly.
Everyone leave the area.</i>

05:23.856 --> 05:26.347
<i>Thank God they're done.</i>

05:26.426 --> 05:28.189
Ow!

05:28.261 --> 05:30.195
Where is your mother?
I don't know.

05:30.263 --> 05:32.197
She said she was gonna pick
up Suzi at school. Yeah?

05:32.265 --> 05:35.860
That's all she said.
That was three hours ago.

05:35.935 --> 05:40.235
It's dark. She could've been in an
accident. She trying to scare me to death?

05:40.306 --> 05:42.536
I told ya.

05:42.608 --> 05:45.668
You think she was in an accident?

05:47.113 --> 05:51.846
No. No, no.
The police would have called.

05:51.918 --> 05:56.753
Okay. But the minute she comes in,
you let me know, all right?

05:56.823 --> 06:00.725
- Could I have a taste of the punch?
- No, I got a roomful of guests. Don't touch anything.

06:00.793 --> 06:04.991
So yesterday, this one comes home
with a set of encyclopedia.

06:05.064 --> 06:09.831
It was on sale.
It was missing three volumes.

06:09.902 --> 06:12.996
I don't need to know everything.
Oh!

06:13.072 --> 06:15.802
Margaret and Suzi
should be home soon.

06:15.875 --> 06:18.776
They were at the college
for some women's charity thing,

06:18.845 --> 06:22.576
and I guess they lost track of time.

06:22.648 --> 06:24.707
Anyway, more cheese puffs?
Oh, just one.

06:24.784 --> 06:26.649
Oh, no.
You're pregnant, honey.

06:26.719 --> 06:29.085
We don't wanna
turn into a cheese puff.

06:31.457 --> 06:34.949
So, George, what are our chances of getting
those family incentive bonuses pushed through?

06:35.027 --> 06:37.757
Evy, honey, would you take these?
I thought those were vetoed...

06:37.830 --> 06:40.264
because they ignored
working mothers.

06:40.333 --> 06:43.825
Thanks, Evy. So you think
that the private enterprise system...

06:43.903 --> 06:46.963
<i>should support the traditional family?</i>

06:47.039 --> 06:50.202
Well, the traditional family supports
the private enterprise system.

06:50.276 --> 06:53.609
Actually, the support
comes from individuals.

06:53.679 --> 06:56.580
Dad! Dad, it's for you!
Guess where Mom is!

06:56.649 --> 07:00.608
Where is she, Son? Still at the college?
Not exactly.

07:00.686 --> 07:05.623
<i>This isn't like a club.
This isn't a movement you join.</i>

07:05.691 --> 07:09.388
There are no fees, no dues,
no membership cards.

07:09.462 --> 07:13.694
We're here because we are friends
who want a better life.

07:13.766 --> 07:16.929
Now we made a difference tonight.
We made people listen.

07:17.003 --> 07:19.164
But it isn't gonna make it-
What a scene!

07:19.238 --> 07:23.675
Chicks in cells. Talk about your
major fantasy. Thank you for sharing.

07:23.743 --> 07:25.711
Now, what the hell
am I doing here?

07:25.778 --> 07:29.214
What could be better?
Chicks in chains in cells.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.443
Al!
That would be bet-What?

07:31.517 --> 07:34.850
Oh. Uh, your name-
Margaret Sanders.

07:34.921 --> 07:38.186
I'm married. I have two children-
Suzi over there and GeorgeJr.

07:38.257 --> 07:39.849
You know this?
Yes, I-

07:39.926 --> 07:43.384
<i>The factory, the convent,
the steno pools, the bedroom.</i>

07:43.463 --> 07:48.127
<i>Anywhere that oppresses us
just because we're women.</i>

07:48.201 --> 07:54.003
Women's lib. L-I don't know. I could never
decide whether it's a hindrance or a help.

07:54.073 --> 07:57.201
<i>Your opinion on this matter is one that I'm not even
remotely curious about. Now, what am I doing here?</i>

07:57.276 --> 08:01.645
<i>- Well, uh, I don't see any trouble
brewing on the horizon.</i>

08:01.714 --> 08:04.046
Look again.

08:06.285 --> 08:08.344
All right, all right.
Let's calm down.

08:08.421 --> 08:11.185
<i>If you ladies can't behave yourselves,
we're gonna have to separate you.</i>

08:11.257 --> 08:13.987
The First Amendment states we have the
right to assemble. Don't you ever touch me!

08:14.060 --> 08:18.429
- Ow!
- Take it easy! Is that necessary? These women aren't criminals.

08:18.498 --> 08:22.093
Unlawful assembly.
Incitement to a riot.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.534
<i>Resisting of arrest.
Every charge is a criminal one.</i>

08:24.604 --> 08:28.199
<i>So don't stand there and tell
me my job, Margaret. Got it.</i>

08:28.274 --> 08:32.210
<i>- 89.3% chance you're here to help Diana.
- What is going on here?</i>

08:32.278 --> 08:35.111
<i>Margaret. Suzanne.</i>

08:36.816 --> 08:41.844
Donny, I want you to let
my family out of there.

08:41.921 --> 08:44.321
I'm afraid I can't do that, George,

08:44.390 --> 08:46.517
not until I get
everybody's name down on paper.

08:46.592 --> 08:50.119
I've known you 15 years.
I just left your son at a dinner party...

08:50.196 --> 08:53.290
at my home to decide his future.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.698
Now I want you to release my family.

08:57.870 --> 09:00.771
He's got somethin' on him, Sam.

09:00.840 --> 09:03.775
I'm releasing them
into your custody, George.

09:03.843 --> 09:07.779
I'll make an arrangement with the booking
sergeant so no one ever knows they were here.

09:07.847 --> 09:10.407
Thanks, Donny, as a friend.

09:10.483 --> 09:13.281
As a friend.

09:13.352 --> 09:17.755
Next time, better keep a tighter rein
on the little woman. Little woman?

09:17.823 --> 09:21.315
Never mind.
I promise it'll never happen again.

09:21.394 --> 09:24.454
Sam, I think you changed history with that
little knight-in-shining-armor act there.

09:24.530 --> 09:26.964
<i>Suzanne?
But, Mom, we've gotta stick together.</i>

09:27.033 --> 09:29.968
<i>Mom?
Margaret, let's go.</i>

09:31.137 --> 09:34.436
<i>Sam, you can go. Ziggy says they're all gonna
get bailed out first thing in the morning.</i>

09:48.354 --> 09:50.584
<i>I really don't see
what the problem is, George.</i>

09:50.656 --> 09:52.851
<i>You don't see what the problem is?</i>

09:52.925 --> 09:56.884
<i>You embarrassed me in front
of the whole community.</i>

09:56.963 --> 09:59.557
And you missed your own dinner party.

09:59.632 --> 10:02.863
And then-
And then, you get arrested.

10:02.935 --> 10:05.426
Arrested!

10:05.504 --> 10:10.567
And then the one guy that's trying
to help us, you talk back to him.

10:10.643 --> 10:14.545
Look, there was no reason for this
ChiefTipton person to act like that.

10:14.614 --> 10:19.244
This ChiefTipton person? Donald Tipton
is a close, personal friend of mine.

10:19.318 --> 10:22.014
He's the father of
one of my finest employees.

10:22.088 --> 10:25.421
What in God's green earth
is goin' on, Margaret?

10:25.491 --> 10:29.723
He was wrong. Friend or
no friend, he was wrong.

10:29.795 --> 10:31.820
No matter what Diane did,
he didn't need to knock her down.

10:31.897 --> 10:35.697
I don't know what is happening,
but I don't like it.

10:37.770 --> 10:39.704
What-

10:40.706 --> 10:45.575
Okay, okay. I'm gonna get a-
a pillow and a blanket.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.409
I'm gonna sleep in the den tonight.

10:48.481 --> 10:52.474
You're not making life
any easier for Margaret, Sam.

10:52.551 --> 10:55.042
What are you talking about?
Well, you changed history.

10:55.121 --> 10:57.055
Yeah?
Remember the little fight,

10:57.123 --> 10:59.057
the altercation you had
with ChiefTipton in the jail?

10:59.125 --> 11:03.858
Yeah. Well, it put a tailspin on
George and Margaret's marriage.

11:03.929 --> 11:07.421
Well, you-you said that I was here
to help Diana, I thought.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.525
Uh, yes.
Well, that's true.

11:09.602 --> 11:14.130
But apparently, by helping Diana, you're
somehow destroying George and Margaret.

11:14.206 --> 11:16.299
<i>Great. Let's just hear it.</i>

11:16.375 --> 11:22.109
Ziggy says there's a 69.2% chance
that George leaves Margaret,

11:22.181 --> 11:25.947
and her life is ruined.

11:35.461 --> 11:38.294
Mom?
Hey. Morning.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.298
Morning.

11:41.834 --> 11:44.166
Doesn't sound like you got too
much sleep last night. I didn't.

11:44.236 --> 11:47.171
No?
That smells good.

11:47.239 --> 11:50.106
Yeah. Listen, uh, why don't you go call
your father and your brother...

11:50.176 --> 11:53.236
and tell them that in a few minutes,
we'll have breakfast.

11:53.312 --> 11:55.644
I'm not speaking
to Dad this morning.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.479
He's the reason I didn't sleep.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.746
You're still angry, huh?
Aren't you?

12:00.820 --> 12:02.583
No.

12:02.655 --> 12:05.453
Not anymore.
New day. New attitude.

12:05.524 --> 12:07.458
What difference
does a new day make?

12:07.526 --> 12:09.687
He won't listen to us any more
today than he did last night.

12:09.762 --> 12:15.723
No, maybe not. But a new day gives us another
chance to find a way to make him listen.

12:15.801 --> 12:19.259
- Why should we have to find a way?
- Because we're the ones who wanna make a change.

12:20.706 --> 12:22.640
You know,
I used to love him so much.

12:22.708 --> 12:25.609
Right. And now you don't?
Of course I love him.

12:25.678 --> 12:28.476
He can make me so angry.

12:28.547 --> 12:31.607
Tell me about it.
I used to be able to talk to him.

12:31.684 --> 12:35.017
I could tell him anything. And now
- You can't even ask him to come into breakfast.

12:35.087 --> 12:36.611
That's his fault.
Is it?

12:36.689 --> 12:38.850
How can you say that?

12:38.924 --> 12:43.054
Look, it takes
two people to communicate.

12:43.129 --> 12:45.393
And I'm- I'm thinking that...

12:45.464 --> 12:48.456
maybe you're approaching him
in a different way these days.

12:48.534 --> 12:51.298
You mean no longer
with awe and wonder?

12:51.370 --> 12:54.305
Something like that.
Are you serious?

12:54.373 --> 12:57.308
- In a way.
- Mom, I can't believe you're saying this.

12:57.376 --> 13:00.345
Suzi, there always has been,
and there always will be,

13:00.412 --> 13:04.178
a normal amount of tension
between teenagers and their parents.

13:04.250 --> 13:06.741
It's just part of growing up.

13:06.819 --> 13:11.347
And maybe the reason your father's
having trouble listening to you is that...

13:11.423 --> 13:13.357
you're having trouble
listening to him.

13:13.425 --> 13:15.825
Well, what about you?
He doesn't listen to you either.

13:15.895 --> 13:17.863
Well, you got a point there.

13:17.930 --> 13:22.196
- Look, Mom, I know you'd love for this revolution to be easy.
- Wouldn't that be wonderful?

13:22.268 --> 13:25.294
But we are gonna have to fight
for every right.

13:25.371 --> 13:29.330
I mean, if we have to go toe-to-toe against the
men, that's what we'll do, just like Diana says.

13:29.408 --> 13:32.741
Literally? Well, shoving ChiefTipton
last night sure made him listen.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.575
I shouldn't have done that.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.673
He was wrong,
but I was wrong to shove him.

13:37.750 --> 13:40.310
Diana says it's the only way
to really make men listen.

13:40.386 --> 13:43.014
That's simply not true.
Now you're questioning Diana?

13:43.088 --> 13:45.215
If she's advocating violence,
yes, I am.

13:45.291 --> 13:50.593
Look, most of the things
that Diana says are- are good things.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.597
They're right.
But not everything.

13:52.665 --> 13:56.999
Just like most of the things that your father
says make sense too, but not everything.

13:57.069 --> 14:00.527
How can you defend him? I'm not defending
him any more than I'm attacking her.

14:00.606 --> 14:03.200
You're gonna meet people
all through your life...

14:03.275 --> 14:07.837
that have their own hopes
and aspirations and fears.

14:07.913 --> 14:10.814
And those feelings
influence the way they think,

14:10.883 --> 14:13.408
and that in turn
will influence the way you think.

14:13.485 --> 14:18.354
The hard part is to find a way
to filter the good from the bad...

14:18.424 --> 14:20.892
no matter who's talking to you,
a man or a woman.

14:25.130 --> 14:27.064
Are you sorry
you burned your bra last night?

14:27.132 --> 14:30.363
No.

14:30.436 --> 14:34.065
The last thing I ever wanna wear
is another bra.

14:34.139 --> 14:35.697
<i>I was really proud of you.
Thank you.</i>

14:35.774 --> 14:38.470
- Good morning.
- Morning.

14:38.544 --> 14:41.035
Griddle cakes à la Beckett.

14:41.113 --> 14:43.047
À la what?
Beckett.

14:43.115 --> 14:45.379
Beckett, Dad. He's a famous
playwright. Samuel Beckett.

14:45.451 --> 14:48.852
Actually, I was thinking
of Mom Beckett, the famous cook.

14:48.921 --> 14:51.287
Mom Beckett?
Yeah.

14:52.591 --> 14:56.425
Uh, but don't we usually have
omelets on Friday?

14:56.495 --> 14:59.521
- You want an omelet?
- No.

14:59.598 --> 15:01.828
No. No,
this-this is fine, really.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.768
I just, um-

15:04.837 --> 15:09.240
Margaret? Margaret,
let's just forget all about last night,

15:09.308 --> 15:12.141
<i>and we'll get the family
back to normal, okay?</i>

15:12.211 --> 15:15.180
'Cause-'Cause I just want
my mellow Margaret back.

15:15.247 --> 15:17.181
Okay?
Okay.

15:17.249 --> 15:19.342
Margaret. But-

15:19.418 --> 15:21.648
I know.
Not in front of the kids.

15:21.720 --> 15:25.588
But... tonight.

15:25.658 --> 15:27.649
Okay?

15:31.063 --> 15:34.055
And how is my other
favorite girl in the world? Huh?

15:34.133 --> 15:40.003
Daddy, you can't just violate someone's
space whenever you feel like it.

15:40.072 --> 15:43.041
All these years,
I thought that was just a hug.

15:43.108 --> 15:46.305
Oh, thanks. Um-

15:46.378 --> 15:50.109
You know, I've always said no one makes a
cup of coffee like my little sweetie pie.

15:50.182 --> 15:52.150
<i>Now there's an achievement.</i>

15:52.217 --> 15:54.685
What?

15:54.753 --> 15:56.687
Oh, well-

15:56.755 --> 16:00.486
Hey, Margaret. Margaret,
you-you missed it last night.

16:00.559 --> 16:02.789
I mean, it's a neck-and-neck race
for this promotion.

16:02.861 --> 16:06.627
You know, uh, Peter
is-is aggressive and-and confident,

16:06.699 --> 16:11.193
and Evy, I have to say,
is a hardworking little machine.

16:11.270 --> 16:13.204
She's dedicated to the customers.

16:13.272 --> 16:16.070
<i>It's a tough choice.
Evy's got a year of seniority.</i>

16:16.141 --> 16:19.440
And then on the other hand,
I have to take into account the fact...

16:19.511 --> 16:22.207
that Peter's got
a family to support.

16:22.281 --> 16:26.047
Evy isn't married?
Now what do you mean by that?

16:26.118 --> 16:29.884
Nothing. You just said that, uh,
Peter's got a family to support.

16:29.955 --> 16:32.822
I just wondered if
- But, see, you know that Evy is married.

16:32.891 --> 16:34.825
I mean, that's my point.

16:34.893 --> 16:38.124
See, that Evy has her husband
to take care of the family's needs.

16:38.197 --> 16:40.631
Well, did you ever consider
that maybe that's why she's working?

16:40.699 --> 16:44.066
Of course, now,
if I did give Evy the promotion,

16:44.136 --> 16:46.161
I could save a lot of money on salary.

16:46.238 --> 16:48.433
<i>That's nothing to sneeze at.
I can't believe you'd say that.</i>

16:48.507 --> 16:52.375
<i>Wait a second. You'd pay her
less money to do the samejob?</i>

16:52.444 --> 16:55.413
- That's the way things are.
- You really don't get it, do you, Dad?

16:55.481 --> 16:57.745
- Get what?
- She's saying that it's not fair...

16:57.816 --> 17:01.582
for you to pay Evy less for doing the
same job just because she's a woman.

17:01.653 --> 17:05.020
But that's policy. What-What am I
supposed to do about that?

17:05.089 --> 17:06.717
Change it.
Why?

17:06.791 --> 17:11.888
<i>I give up. I'm going to school
where people still bother to think.</i>

17:11.964 --> 17:14.057
Far out, Mom.
You made the morning paper.

17:19.070 --> 17:21.904
Yeah. Well- Oh, you know,
that doesn't really look like me.

17:21.973 --> 17:25.239
Let me take a look at that.
Too bad they didn't print your name.

17:25.310 --> 17:28.973
<i>They didn't have to. Everybody
knows her. What's burning?</i>

17:29.048 --> 17:31.915
Ah! Uh- Uh-

17:31.984 --> 17:36.318
The griddle cakes are-are burning.
We're having pancakes?

17:36.388 --> 17:38.288
<i>I'm gonna get something to eat
at the office-</i>

17:38.357 --> 17:43.920
While I think of some way to explain that-
that picture in the newspaper.

17:43.996 --> 17:47.227
<i>Margaret, this is the last time
you make a laughingstock out of me.</i>

17:49.802 --> 17:52.896
Wait a minute.
Now, now, Sam.

17:52.971 --> 17:55.269
I know this may seem a little
strange to you. Strange?

17:55.340 --> 17:58.207
Yeah, strange.
My daughter is insulting me.

17:58.277 --> 18:01.075
My wife is on the front page
of the newspaper...

18:01.146 --> 18:05.276
holding her brassiere in the air
for the whole world to see,

18:05.350 --> 18:07.284
and I'm gonna get laughed at
by my employees.

18:07.352 --> 18:09.946
I call that a hell of a lot more
than strange.

18:10.022 --> 18:12.650
Look, I didn't mean to make
a joke out of you, and neither did Suzi.

18:12.724 --> 18:17.627
We were just trying to do something to bring
closed-minded people into this century, that's all.

18:17.696 --> 18:22.429
"We" did it? Since when do you make
unilateral decisions concerning this family?

18:22.501 --> 18:25.129
Now, I want
my wife and my daughter...

18:25.204 --> 18:28.696
to stop hangin' out with these rabble-rousers
and get this family back to normal!

18:28.774 --> 18:34.508
I've rescheduled dinner tonight for
Peter and Evy at 8:00. You will be there.

18:36.882 --> 18:39.851
And pick up my suit
at the cleaners, please.

18:43.255 --> 18:45.655
Mom?

18:45.724 --> 18:48.386
Don't even start.

18:48.460 --> 18:51.156
You sit down, eat some breakfast
and get to school.

18:57.703 --> 19:01.696
Do you believe that?
Do you believe that man?

19:01.773 --> 19:06.972
I hate the way he orders me around
- Margaret around like that. "Little sweetie pie. " It's demeaning.

19:07.045 --> 19:11.141
Well, actually, that's the only way
he knows how to say "I love you. "

19:11.216 --> 19:13.707
<i>Oh, please.
Yes.</i>

19:13.785 --> 19:17.346
George is from a generation
that was taught that women have a place,

19:17.422 --> 19:20.823
<i>and men have a place,
and never the twain shall meet.</i>

19:20.893 --> 19:25.694
Well, if that's the system, then take it
from somebody on this side in a dress, okay?

19:25.764 --> 19:27.994
It should crash and burn.
Maybe.

19:28.066 --> 19:30.500
Maybe? Nobody should be
treated like that, Al. Nobody.

19:30.569 --> 19:32.662
Patronized, insulted like that, it's-

19:32.738 --> 19:35.605
George and all the other
Georges in the world,

19:35.674 --> 19:38.142
they have no idea that
they're denigrating women.

19:38.210 --> 19:40.576
It's just they were never taught
to behave any other way.

19:40.646 --> 19:43.274
My dad never once
treated my mother like that.

19:43.348 --> 19:46.249
He never talked to her like that.
He nev-

19:46.318 --> 19:49.048
Why are you defending him? You're
here to help Diana St. Cloud.

19:49.121 --> 19:51.055
Lf, in the meantime,

19:51.123 --> 19:55.082
you can open George's eyes to show how
he's treating Margaret, well, that's fine.

19:55.160 --> 19:58.891
If I open his eyes, I might destroy their
marriage. That's what you said last night, right?

19:58.964 --> 20:01.626
Look at this.

20:01.700 --> 20:05.101
"Gingsberg. "
"Stokely Carmichael and Hamilton. "

20:05.170 --> 20:07.900
Looks like everybody's
lookin' for a change.

20:07.973 --> 20:10.908
Sam, you gotta attack
one problem at a time.

20:10.976 --> 20:13.069
Okay. All right.
Okay.

20:13.145 --> 20:15.079
Which problem?

20:15.147 --> 20:18.913
Well, Diana St. Cloud
is planning a protest march tonight,

20:18.984 --> 20:23.444
and, uh, because of
your heroic gesture,

20:23.522 --> 20:25.513
the police chiefTipton there,
your friend,

20:25.591 --> 20:27.889
he gets a little more aggressive
than he normally would.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.326
- He pulls out his gun.
- He shoots Diana?

20:30.395 --> 20:32.522
Yes. Well, see,
according to the paper,

20:32.598 --> 20:35.260
Tipton's trying to stop this march, and
they get in a struggle and this and that.

20:35.334 --> 20:37.666
Then during the struggle, he pulls the
gun, and she gets the gun away from him.

20:37.736 --> 20:40.261
Then when he gets it back,
it goes off.

20:41.573 --> 20:46.237
Now all you have to do is, you talk Diana
out of doing this protest march thing,

20:46.311 --> 20:49.906
and Ziggy says there's a 86% chance
that you'll leap, everything's fine.

20:49.982 --> 20:52.815
You forget George, and you
don't have to cook dinner. Okay.

20:52.884 --> 20:55.079
Where is she?
She's, uh-

20:55.153 --> 20:57.986
Oh, here it is.
She's at, uh, the Women's Collective.

20:58.056 --> 21:00.923
Third and Buchanan.
Okay, I'll talk to her.

21:00.993 --> 21:03.427
<i>I gotta get Diana
to change her mind.</i>

21:03.495 --> 21:05.486
I forgot my purse-

21:10.802 --> 21:13.862
<i>For some reason,
all my Swiss cheese brain could remember...</i>

21:13.939 --> 21:16.772
<i>about the women's movement
was something that my mom once said-</i>

21:16.842 --> 21:20.642
<i>that it was probably a good thing...
for other women.</i>

21:20.712 --> 21:24.648
<i>But I had an understanding that no other
man on the face of the earth could have.</i>

21:24.716 --> 21:28.345
<i>I was a woman, had been a woman,
on a number ofleaps,</i>

21:28.420 --> 21:30.888
<i>and it was an eye-opening experience.</i>

21:30.956 --> 21:32.890
<i>Still, with all the right
I knew they had on their side,</i>

21:32.958 --> 21:35.859
<i>I couldn't condone
Diana's promotion of violence.</i>

21:35.927 --> 21:38.828
<i>I had to find a way
to change her thinking...</i>

21:38.897 --> 21:40.728
<i>notjust for the movement,
but to save her life.</i>

21:53.545 --> 21:58.107
<i>So there we were in this little room
in Washington with mountains of files.</i>

21:58.183 --> 22:00.310
Do you wanna take a break?
Mm-hmm!

22:01.653 --> 22:05.316
Which said things like
women make up only one percent...

22:05.390 --> 22:07.551
of the engineers in this country,

22:07.626 --> 22:09.856
only three percent of its lawyers-

22:09.928 --> 22:11.862
Are you kidding?

22:11.930 --> 22:13.898
Only seven percent of its doctors.

22:13.965 --> 22:15.899
Wow.

22:15.967 --> 22:17.935
And then it-
And then it dawned on me.

22:18.003 --> 22:22.201
Women don't make decisions because
too few of them have any real power.

22:22.274 --> 22:27.211
In marriage, husbands and wives are
one, and that one is the husband.

22:27.279 --> 22:31.045
Diana, I just don't understand.
How did we let it get that way?

22:31.116 --> 22:33.084
Fear.

22:33.151 --> 22:35.711
<i>Of what?</i>

22:35.787 --> 22:39.279
Well, mine started with my father
when he used to beat me. Really?

22:39.358 --> 22:43.556
And when he wasn't hitting me, he would
tell me I was stupid and brainless.

22:43.628 --> 22:48.429
And my mother allowed it because she was so
afraid she wouldn't be able to survive alone.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.400
I can't believe anyone
would hit their own child.

22:50.469 --> 22:55.099
Well, I guess by putting me down, my father
was making himself feel smarter and stronger.

22:55.173 --> 22:56.970
But that's wrong.

22:57.042 --> 23:01.138
I know. Suzi,

23:01.213 --> 23:04.910
men have been oppressing women for
thousands of years, and we've allowed it.

23:04.983 --> 23:07.247
Well, I'm not gonna allow it.
We allow it.

23:07.319 --> 23:10.152
And every time we tell our daughters
they're not as bright,

23:10.222 --> 23:13.282
not as strong,
not as good as men,

23:13.358 --> 23:16.589
every time, we're creating
another generation of fear.

23:16.661 --> 23:20.427
<i>If we wanna make a change,
we're gonna have to get face-to-face.</i>

23:20.499 --> 23:22.933
We're gonna have to tell them,
"No more," and mean it.

23:23.001 --> 23:25.629
<i>They wanna push us around,
we'll push back.</i>

23:25.704 --> 23:28.605
<i>If they wanna slap us around,
we'll slap back.</i>

23:28.673 --> 23:30.971
If they wanna fight,
we'll give 'em a fight.

23:31.042 --> 23:34.034
<i>Yeah. Do you really think
you can win a physical fight?</i>

23:34.112 --> 23:36.444
<i>That's exactly what gets Diana killed, Sam.
Mom!</i>

23:36.515 --> 23:38.813
<i>I'm sorry. Shejust doesn't understand.
Yes, I do.</i>

23:38.884 --> 23:43.321
I understand that you cannot
match strength in a physical confrontation.

23:43.388 --> 23:45.982
- Unless we fight, nothing will change.
- Fine. Fine.

23:46.057 --> 23:48.617
Then fight them in the boardrooms,
not in a street brawl.

23:48.693 --> 23:51.685
You wanna make a change?
Take a lesson from Ghandi.

23:51.763 --> 23:53.492
- Or King.
- Or Martin Luther King.

23:53.565 --> 23:56.125
Mom, please. Let's go.
You go out and start a riot,

23:56.201 --> 23:59.898
and people will only notice
what's wrong about you.

23:59.971 --> 24:02.769
But you state your beliefs
in an orderly fashion,

24:02.841 --> 24:04.968
and people will notice
what's wrong about the system.

24:05.043 --> 24:09.537
Stage sit-ins or boycotts.
Your mom's got a good idea, Suzi.

24:09.614 --> 24:11.844
- She does?
- And it's better press.

24:11.917 --> 24:14.613
Besides, it's better press.

24:14.686 --> 24:17.985
- It's a way to make them listen.
- Well, all right, Mom.

24:18.056 --> 24:21.184
- Now Diana doesn't get shot.
- And you, young lady, were supposed to be in school.

24:21.259 --> 24:23.784
<i>Out of the streets
and into the boardrooms.</i>

24:23.862 --> 24:26.126
<i>Okay, everybody.
Change of plan.</i>

24:30.368 --> 24:34.600
George. Was that Margaret's picture
I saw in the paper this morning?

24:34.673 --> 24:37.506
Yeah, well, women.

24:37.576 --> 24:41.239
You know how they are sometimes.
I've been divorced three times.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.713
<i>Tell me about it.
I may be right behind you.</i>

24:43.782 --> 24:46.444
<i>He was so depressed by the news,
he couldn't even go home.</i>

24:46.518 --> 24:49.385
He just sat there
in the hospital waiting room.

24:49.454 --> 24:52.321
I said to him,
"What's so bad about being a father?"

24:52.390 --> 24:55.382
He says, "Nothing. I just don't know
how to break the news to my wife. "

24:57.662 --> 25:00.893
Okay.
Back to the salt mines.

25:00.966 --> 25:04.527
Is your staff ready for the 3:00
with Frank? Ready as we'll ever be.

25:04.603 --> 25:06.935
- Well, that's the spirit.
- How's my big shot son?

25:07.005 --> 25:08.905
What are you doing here?
Checking up on you.

25:08.974 --> 25:11.067
Can I see you a minute, George?
Yeah, sure.

25:11.142 --> 25:13.372
Why don't you have Dora
call your mom about a dinner?

25:13.445 --> 25:16.505
Okay.

25:16.581 --> 25:19.448
He's a fine boy.
Yeah, he is a fine boy.

25:19.518 --> 25:24.217
I've been asked to watch this Diana St.
Cloud and her little group for the F.B.I.

25:24.289 --> 25:26.280
What on earth for?

25:26.358 --> 25:29.054
The bureau seems to think
she's dangerous.

25:29.127 --> 25:31.994
Donny, I-I think we're making
a mountain out of a molehill here.

25:32.063 --> 25:34.463
I'm afraid the feds
don't agree with you.

25:34.533 --> 25:37.525
They say Diana St. Cloud is tied
to several subversive groups.

25:37.602 --> 25:41.800
Now, Margaret and Suzanne are not
involved in anything like that. Believe me.

25:41.873 --> 25:44.273
I just saw them leaving
the Women's Collective.

25:44.342 --> 25:47.743
I don't think you have
any control over her, George.

25:47.812 --> 25:51.714
I'm supposed to turn over
every name to the F.B.I.

25:51.783 --> 25:54.445
I don't think that's necessary.
Neither do I.

25:56.121 --> 25:59.454
I just thought you'd like to know.

26:02.060 --> 26:03.925
Thank you, Donny.

26:03.995 --> 26:06.429
Oh, by the way.
I understand my son and his wife...

26:06.498 --> 26:08.432
are coming over to your place
for dinner tonight.

26:08.500 --> 26:12.163
- Yeah.
- We're sure counting on that promotion for Peter.

26:15.206 --> 26:17.140
As one old friend to another.

26:25.917 --> 26:29.250
<i>Okay, another tablespoon
into another mushroom cap.</i>

26:29.321 --> 26:32.188
<i>Mom, I'm home.</i>

26:33.258 --> 26:35.818
- Where you been? I wanted to talk to you.
- At school.

26:35.894 --> 26:39.625
You're not my only obligation in life,
you know. So what'd you wanna talk about?

26:39.698 --> 26:41.825
I made a bad mistake,
and I told Tina about your troubles.

26:41.900 --> 26:43.834
Uh, nothing.

26:43.902 --> 26:46.803
You know what she said?
She said George sounds like me.

26:46.871 --> 26:48.805
She called me a chauvinist!

26:48.873 --> 26:50.465
This tastes awful!
Really? You're surprised?

26:50.542 --> 26:52.510
Yeah, you usually make
these great. Surprised?

26:52.577 --> 26:57.810
Are you okay? I mean, no offense,
but you seem a little weird.

26:57.882 --> 27:01.545
<i>- I always considered myself a sensitive and giving person.
- I think it's kind of cool.</i>

27:01.620 --> 27:03.315
But you just seem different.
I tell you what.

27:03.388 --> 27:06.323
Why don't you do on upstairs
and start your homework, all right?

27:06.391 --> 27:08.621
And I'll call you
when dinner's ready.

27:08.693 --> 27:12.288
Would you mind tasting this though? I've never
made it before. I'm a little nervous about it.

27:12.364 --> 27:15.527
Oh, Mom!
Maybe I'll skip dinner.

27:15.600 --> 27:18.125
<i>Just call me when
The Flying Nun comes on.</i>

27:18.203 --> 27:21.195
<i>The Flying Nun?</i>

27:23.041 --> 27:25.032
<i>What is it, Al?
Bad news, Sam.</i>

27:25.110 --> 27:27.840
<i>Suzi gets shot tonight at
her father's club. What?</i>

27:27.912 --> 27:31.143
Are you sure? I mean, check it again,
please. There's gotta be a mistake.

27:31.216 --> 27:35.152
Mom, who are you talking to?

27:35.220 --> 27:37.848
Uh, nobody, Suzi.
Hi.

27:37.922 --> 27:41.414
I was just, uh, practicing
dinner conversation, kind of.

27:41.493 --> 27:44.053
Oh. Well, I was just
coming to tell you...

27:44.129 --> 27:47.656
that Diana's decided to stage the sit-in
at the Addison Men's Club.

27:47.732 --> 27:49.723
What? Dad's club.
Isn't that great?

27:49.801 --> 27:51.996
<i>92.3 that she still gets shot tonight.</i>

27:52.070 --> 27:54.004
Suzi?
Mm-hmm?

27:54.072 --> 27:58.031
I've been thinking. I'd prefer it
if you didn't go to the sit-in tonight.

27:58.109 --> 28:01.545
What are you talking about? Well, I just
have a really bad feeling about all this.

28:01.613 --> 28:04.639
Mom, you're the one who talked Diana
into doing this in the first place.

28:04.716 --> 28:07.207
I know. I know.
But I really want you to stay home.

28:07.285 --> 28:09.845
Mom, are you flipping out?
Huh?

28:09.921 --> 28:13.379
You're talking to yourself; you're
changing your mind every two seconds.

28:13.458 --> 28:16.052
What's going on with you?
I can't really explain it.

28:16.127 --> 28:18.425
I just-
You gotta trust me on this.

28:18.496 --> 28:23.058
Besides, I-I really need your help
working out this dinner tonight.

28:23.134 --> 28:25.068
<i>Do you really need me?
Good.</i>

28:25.136 --> 28:29.800
- The odds are going down. - But there'll
be other sit-ins, other demonstrations.

28:29.874 --> 28:32.604
<i>What a surprise to find you both here.</i>

28:32.677 --> 28:35.271
- Busy afternoon, Margaret?
- Don't-Don't tell him.

28:35.346 --> 28:38.577
Busy?
No, not too busy.

28:38.650 --> 28:42.814
Um, listen,
I wanna ask you something.

28:42.887 --> 28:45.913
<i>What do you think of these mushrooms?
Honestly. I called the house.</i>

28:45.990 --> 28:48.322
You weren't here.
Where were you?

28:48.393 --> 28:51.089
I had to run some errands.

28:51.162 --> 28:54.962
<i>Oh. Oh, yes. Um, my suit-
Did you pick it up?</i>

28:55.033 --> 28:59.902
Your suit. Yeah. You know,
I- I-I went to the dry cleaners.

28:59.971 --> 29:02.269
- It was closed.
- And they were closed.

29:02.340 --> 29:07.107
Closed. I see. Closed just long
enough for you and Susan to disobey me.

29:07.178 --> 29:09.578
<i>Disobey you? Disobey you?</i>

29:09.647 --> 29:11.581
Go over to that women's libber den.

29:11.649 --> 29:14.345
- We're not children, Dad.
- Would you go to your room, Suzi?

29:14.419 --> 29:16.353
Wait a second.
It's not a den, okay?

29:16.421 --> 29:19.788
It's a place where people go to discuss
ideas. I don't care what you call it.

29:19.858 --> 29:25.353
I don't give a damn. L- I-I told you
I didn't want you around those people.

29:25.430 --> 29:30.493
<i>Now I'm telling you that if you're so much
as on the same block as that Diane St. Cloud,</i>

29:30.568 --> 29:32.502
I'm out of this house.

29:32.570 --> 29:36.199
- Uh-oh.
- You don't understand what's happening, George.

29:36.274 --> 29:40.677
What's happening is you're ruining our
marriage. Now, either this nonsense stops,

29:40.745 --> 29:44.806
or you-you can ask
your new women's lib friends...

29:44.883 --> 29:47.181
to-to support you and the kids.

29:47.252 --> 29:49.345
<i>Dad, now, you look.</i>

29:49.420 --> 29:52.150
Maybe you can threaten Mom,
but you don't own me.

29:52.223 --> 29:55.681
<i>I'm going to that sit-in tonight,
and you're not gonna stop me.</i>

29:55.760 --> 29:58.388
You will not tell me
what to do, young lady!

29:58.463 --> 30:02.661
<i>Go to your room and stay there! I'm not a
kid anymore.! I am not listening to you.!</i>

30:05.403 --> 30:08.201
<i>You're doing a hell of a job
of raising our daughter, Margaret.</i>

30:08.273 --> 30:10.969
I didn't realize
I was raising her alone.

30:11.042 --> 30:14.273
Well, just what kind of mother
are you turning into?

30:14.345 --> 30:17.837
George, I don't want Suzi
at that sit-in tonight.

30:17.916 --> 30:20.214
It's important that
she stay at home.

30:20.285 --> 30:22.515
Brilliant deduction.
I mean,

30:22.587 --> 30:25.988
if you had done what I asked you to do in the first
place, we would not be facing this problem now.

30:26.057 --> 30:27.991
I don't want to argue
with you about this, George.

30:28.059 --> 30:31.028
I need you to help me
keep her here. I intend to.

30:31.095 --> 30:33.689
I'm locking her in her room
until she gets some sense in her head.

30:33.765 --> 30:36.393
Why don't you try talking to her
instead of bullying her?

30:36.467 --> 30:39.527
You handle it your way,
and I'll handle it mine.

30:39.604 --> 30:42.539
<i>Let him do it, Sam.
Maybe it'll keep her alive.</i>

30:42.607 --> 30:45.770
Just stay away from Diane St. Cloud,
or I'm moving to the club.

30:49.314 --> 30:53.250
<i>Great. Our guests are here.</i>

30:56.888 --> 31:00.847
What about Diana? Ziggy says you still
have to be at that sit-in at 9:00.

31:00.925 --> 31:05.294
Damn it. It's at 85%
that George moves out after tonight.

31:15.039 --> 31:18.566
<i>I think you're missing the point, Peter.
Let me explain it to you again.</i>

31:18.643 --> 31:20.770
<i>I'm not missing the point.
I wrote the point.</i>

31:20.845 --> 31:23.439
<i>We have to find a way
to nip this move...</i>

31:23.514 --> 31:25.277
on nationalized insurance
in the bud.

31:25.350 --> 31:27.284
I'll get the wine.

31:27.352 --> 31:30.879
Everyone knows that the quality
of health care will go down...

31:30.955 --> 31:35.415
<i>when the consumer loses his ability
to choose his physician and carrier.</i>

31:35.493 --> 31:38.690
Excuse me. I'm gonna see if Margaret
needs any help in the kitchen. Thanks, Evy.

31:38.763 --> 31:44.167
I proposed to Frank that we put a certain
percentage of profits into a lobbyist fund. Thanks.

31:44.235 --> 31:46.999
<i>Is there anything I can do to help?</i>

31:47.071 --> 31:49.005
No, no.
Everything's fine.

31:49.073 --> 31:52.042
I just have to get this, uh,
roast outta here...

31:52.110 --> 31:54.442
and get it cut up and stuff.

31:54.512 --> 31:56.446
Smells good.
Yeah.

31:56.514 --> 32:00.382
I think that the presentation
went just great.

32:00.451 --> 32:02.783
I think everything is gonna be fine.

32:02.854 --> 32:05.482
<i>Are you sure there isn't
anything I can do?</i>

32:05.556 --> 32:07.148
As a matter of fact, there is.

32:07.225 --> 32:10.626
You can go out there and tell George
what some of your ideas are.

32:10.695 --> 32:13.255
Oh, I really don't think that's appropriate
to talk about at a party.

32:13.331 --> 32:16.994
Well, Peter sure does.
Or hadn't you noticed?

32:17.068 --> 32:20.435
Evy, do you want this promotion?

32:20.505 --> 32:22.769
Oh, I'd like it very much.
But that's up to your husband.

32:22.840 --> 32:25.900
Well, it's also up to you. You gotta
give him some ammunition, you know?

32:25.977 --> 32:29.674
You gotta
- You gotta tell him how good you are, or else he'll never know.

32:29.747 --> 32:32.443
It's just that I'm not one of
those pushy, bossy women.

32:32.517 --> 32:36.886
Well, when a man is pushy and bossy,
it's called aggressive, and it's admired.

32:36.955 --> 32:40.322
Now, why can't a woman
be the same?

32:40.391 --> 32:42.325
You sure people
won't be offended?

32:42.393 --> 32:45.362
For telling them
what you believe? Hmm.

32:45.430 --> 32:47.421
Go on.

32:53.004 --> 32:54.938
Go get 'em.

32:55.940 --> 32:59.171
<i>I just don't know how
to break the news to my wife.</i>

33:01.012 --> 33:06.917
Peter, you were talking about
the future of insurance companies.

33:06.985 --> 33:09.852
But you neglected to mention a
huge statistic. I don't think so.

33:09.921 --> 33:11.855
Peter, did you ever consider...

33:11.923 --> 33:14.414
the number of women
entering the workforce?

33:14.492 --> 33:16.687
How do you feel, honey?

33:16.761 --> 33:19.389
You need some tea or something?
No. I'm fine.

33:19.464 --> 33:24.026
They're going to constitute
a large percentage of our new customers.

33:24.102 --> 33:26.070
What do they want?
What do they need?

33:26.137 --> 33:30.369
Well, I dealt with that on my perspective
of the traditional family.

33:30.441 --> 33:32.773
The traditional family of what decade?

33:32.844 --> 33:35.278
<i>You know, instead of trying to figure out
how to go back to the '50s,</i>

33:35.346 --> 33:38.372
I think we should be looking
at how to move into the '70s.

33:38.449 --> 33:41.543
You know, most of these women
have to work.

33:41.619 --> 33:43.610
They don't wanna leave
their children at home.

33:43.688 --> 33:45.918
<i>How do we assure them...</i>

33:45.990 --> 33:51.360
that if they're-they're sick or disabled,
their children will be cared for?

33:53.297 --> 33:56.232
No more to drink for you.

33:58.202 --> 34:01.399
Those are the challenges we're facing,
Peter.

34:01.472 --> 34:06.967
Evy, uh, why didn't you bring up these questions
at the meeting this afternoon?

34:08.579 --> 34:10.706
I didn't think anyone would listen.

34:14.485 --> 34:16.418
<i>I've never done anything
like this before.</i>

34:16.487 --> 34:18.545
You were at the bra-burning
the other night.

34:18.623 --> 34:20.989
But my dad didn't order me
not to be there.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.493
Tonight, he sent me to my room-
Sent you to your room.

34:23.561 --> 34:25.654
With orders to stay away from you.

34:25.730 --> 34:30.099
God. He sounds like my father. "How dare
you disobey me!" Whack! "Go to your room. "

34:30.168 --> 34:33.262
Oh, he didn't slap me.
My father would never hit me.

34:33.337 --> 34:36.101
Well, you're lucky.
You got the best of a bad bunch.

34:36.174 --> 34:38.938
I guess so.

34:39.010 --> 34:42.446
<i>Suzi, sometimes you have to break a
few rules to do what's right. I know.</i>

34:42.513 --> 34:46.643
Diana, I don't want you to think
I've never disobeyed my father.

34:46.717 --> 34:51.279
I mean, God, I've skipped classes.
I've stayed out past curfew. Ooh!

34:51.355 --> 34:53.255
Pretty heavy disobedience.

34:53.324 --> 34:56.487
<i>I guess I haven't rebelled
in anything important.</i>

34:56.561 --> 34:58.791
And I know
what I'm doing tonight is right.

34:58.863 --> 35:02.128
- Well, that's all that matters.
- Then why do I feel so bad about disobeying him?

35:02.200 --> 35:04.430
- Maybe you don't wanna grow up.
- Are you kidding?

35:04.502 --> 35:08.495
Hey, it's a lot easier to let Daddy take care
of you than to be responsible for yourself.

35:08.573 --> 35:11.838
Look at the hausfraus
in this country.

35:11.909 --> 35:15.970
Just gone from one daddy to another. They graduate high
school, they marry the first guy that gets 'em pregnant.

35:16.047 --> 35:20.006
And then in exchange for cooking,
cleaning and bedroom privileges,

35:20.084 --> 35:22.314
their husbands take care of them
like Daddy did.

35:22.386 --> 35:25.082
- My mom and dad got married right after high school.
- Well, your mom is different.

35:25.156 --> 35:27.147
She showed me that when
she stood up to ChiefTipton.

35:27.225 --> 35:31.787
<i>You know, she regrets doing that.
Oh, not defending you. Shoving him.</i>

35:31.863 --> 35:34.525
<i>She doesn't believe in physical violence.</i>

35:34.599 --> 35:36.726
Yeah. What woman does?
Unfortunately,

35:36.801 --> 35:39.702
physical violence to a man
is just another form of communication,

35:39.770 --> 35:42.204
and, I'm sad to say,
it's about the only one they respect.

35:42.273 --> 35:44.070
My father taught me that...

35:44.142 --> 35:46.542
and lived to regret it.

35:46.611 --> 35:49.011
Don't worry. I didn't kill him.

35:49.080 --> 35:51.640
Oh, I didn't think you did.

35:52.950 --> 35:55.248
Although I came close.

36:04.729 --> 36:07.095
Al, what are you doin' here?
Sam, we're in big trouble.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.759
No-No, we're not. I got until
9:00 to stop Diana. Yes, we are.

36:09.834 --> 36:12.302
What? It's not about
Diana. It's about Suzi.

36:12.370 --> 36:14.804
Suzi's okay. She's locked in her room.
George locked her up there.

36:14.872 --> 36:17.067
Well, she got out. How'd she get
out? I've been here the whole time.

36:17.141 --> 36:19.336
It doesn't make any difference.
She's gone.

36:19.410 --> 36:25.042
And according to Ziggy, her hero, Diana
St. Cloud, didn't study up on her Ghandi.

36:25.116 --> 36:27.983
Suzi still gets shot? Diana's trying
to make some kind of a statement.

36:28.052 --> 36:32.284
Yes, Suzi gets shot,
and SheriffTipton gets shot too.

36:32.356 --> 36:34.756
Put that thing down and go! Go!

36:34.825 --> 36:37.817
Please. Now, please.
We've had a minor disturbance here.

36:37.895 --> 36:41.524
But it's nothing serious.
I would appreciate your cooperation.

36:41.599 --> 36:44.625
<i>The chief is on his way. Please!
This is a respectable club.</i>

36:44.702 --> 36:48.604
Liberation now! Liberation now!

36:48.673 --> 36:53.770
We're being exploited
as sex objects, breeders,

36:53.844 --> 36:55.778
domestic servants, cheap labor.

36:55.846 --> 36:57.541
Thank heaven you're here.
Where are they?

36:57.615 --> 36:59.776
They waltzed right in, sat down
in the middle of the dining room.

36:59.850 --> 37:01.784
I don't know where they came from.

37:01.852 --> 37:04.582
<i>Come on, Sam. Hurry up.! Hurry up.!</i>

37:04.655 --> 37:06.953
You gotta get there, Sam,
and talk to them.

37:07.024 --> 37:09.219
They're not gonna listen to me.

37:09.293 --> 37:11.193
And don't tell me what the odds are.

37:11.262 --> 37:13.355
Uh- Uh, you're right.

37:13.431 --> 37:15.365
You don't wanna know
what the odds are.

37:15.433 --> 37:17.663
Look, what I do wanna know
is how Tipton gets shot.

37:17.735 --> 37:20.203
Well, Ziggy's still pulling the details,
but my guess...

37:20.271 --> 37:24.173
is that Ms. St. Cloud thought she might
need a backup, and she brought her own.

37:24.242 --> 37:26.176
What are you talkin' about?

37:26.244 --> 37:29.304
I overheard her tellin' Suzi that she had
an abusive father that used to beat her up.

37:29.380 --> 37:32.440
She- She survived,
but she's got emotional scars.

37:32.516 --> 37:35.644
Yeah, and she's not gonna take any
chances on Tipton getting an opportunity...

37:35.720 --> 37:37.654
to repeat what happened
in that jail cell.

37:37.722 --> 37:41.522
Exactly. You go on
ahead, Al. All right?

37:41.592 --> 37:45.289
As soon as we know what's going on, I'm
sure Mr. Flanners will make a statement.

37:45.363 --> 37:49.424
I mean, never in 200 years has there
ever been a woman in the dining room.

37:50.868 --> 37:53.166
<i>All right, all right!
Everybody, on their feet.</i>

37:53.237 --> 37:56.138
No! Don't move.
This is private property.

37:56.207 --> 37:59.267
<i>You're trespassing,
and everyone here is under arrest.</i>

37:59.343 --> 38:01.436
Okay, what now?
I gotta talk to ChiefTipton.

38:01.512 --> 38:04.811
Sam? Don't hit him.

38:06.284 --> 38:08.377
Women's submission
is not the result of brainwashing-

38:08.452 --> 38:10.352
Get up, Miss St. Cloud. You're under
arrest. Stupidity or mental illness,

38:10.421 --> 38:13.481
but rather the constant,
daily abusive behavior of men!

38:13.557 --> 38:16.025
<i>- I said, you're under arrest.!
- Let go of me! You're not my father!</i>

38:16.093 --> 38:19.324
<i>Move it, Sam.!</i>

38:19.397 --> 38:22.560
<i>I've had enough of you! No.!</i>

38:22.633 --> 38:26.626
<i>I wouldn't do that, dear.
Sam, you'd better get in here and do something.!</i>

38:37.081 --> 38:39.572
<i>Diana, this is not the way to change things.
- Margaret.</i>

38:39.650 --> 38:41.914
We're not the ones who need to change!
They are!

38:41.986 --> 38:43.920
Put that gun down!

38:43.988 --> 38:46.354
- Have you told 'em what your demands are?
- What are you talking about?

38:46.424 --> 38:49.359
Well, unless you tell them what you
want, they can't change anything.

38:49.427 --> 38:51.895
<i>Sam, keep her talking.
Keep her talking.</i>

38:51.962 --> 38:53.930
Tell 'em what this is for.
Tell them what you want, Diana.

38:53.998 --> 38:55.829
We want equal rights.

38:55.900 --> 38:58.869
- You wanna be a member of this club?
- For starters.

38:58.936 --> 39:02.872
- Logic, Sam. Get her off of her emotions.
- Did you apply for membership and were rejected?

39:02.940 --> 39:05.670
- No, she did not.
- If I did, would you let me in?

39:05.743 --> 39:07.370
- It's up to the committee.
- That's a lie!

39:07.445 --> 39:09.709
You don't know
because you didn't try.

39:09.780 --> 39:13.341
It's in the bylaws-A woman
can't own a membership to this club.

39:13.417 --> 39:18.320
<i>It's segregation, Sam, but it's not
against the constitution in a private club.</i>

39:18.389 --> 39:22.325
<i>Then you have to amend the bylaws.</i>

39:22.393 --> 39:26.193
You have to amend
the Constitution of the United States.

39:26.263 --> 39:29.232
<i>That'll take forever
as long as men control it.</i>

39:29.300 --> 39:31.700
<i>You wanna beat the system, you've
gotta confront it with its own rules.</i>

39:31.769 --> 39:34.533
So you're telling us
to go home and file an application?

39:34.605 --> 39:38.200
I'm asking you to use the law. Now, come
on. Put the gun down and let's do this right.

39:38.275 --> 39:40.368
You're asking us to quit just like you quit.

39:40.444 --> 39:43.311
I won't be like you!
Just take a good look at yourself.

39:43.381 --> 39:46.873
<i>You'rejust like my mother.
You're turning into the dutiful hausfrau.</i>

39:46.951 --> 39:49.044
A messenger for the oppressor.

39:49.120 --> 39:51.452
<i>Housewives and mothers
are not your enemy.</i>

39:51.522 --> 39:53.581
They're your ally.
Now don't segregate us.

39:54.959 --> 39:57.325
Diana, no.

39:57.395 --> 40:00.330
Women like you are the reason we'll-
we'll never get equal rights.

40:00.398 --> 40:04.664
<i>You're so conditioned, you believe that
as long as men say so, the system's right.</i>

40:04.735 --> 40:08.603
<i>What is pointing a gun at the chief
of police gonna accomplish, Diana?</i>

40:10.674 --> 40:13.074
You're running out of time, Sam.

40:13.144 --> 40:16.443
There's so much work to be done.
We need you here, not in a prison.

40:16.514 --> 40:18.607
They'll never let me play fair.

40:18.682 --> 40:24.484
<i>We need to take a stand.!
Are you with me or this housewife?</i>

40:24.555 --> 40:26.489
You said this was about choice.

40:26.557 --> 40:29.754
There's nothing wrong
with being a housewife.

40:29.827 --> 40:33.786
Mom's right. We'll never get anywhere
if we keep blaming each other...

40:33.864 --> 40:36.298
and fighting among ourselves.

40:36.367 --> 40:39.768
<i>Come on, Diana. Please.</i>

40:39.837 --> 40:43.364
No! No! They're gonna kill me!
Come on.

40:48.045 --> 40:51.879
All right. I'm giving you all one minute to
leave this establishment and return to your homes.

40:51.949 --> 40:55.214
<i>Don't let the white, male establishment
tell you what to do.!</i>

40:55.286 --> 40:57.982
<i>They can only have power
over you if you let them.!</i>

40:58.055 --> 41:01.889
You can't let us
slip back into the dark ages!

41:01.959 --> 41:05.520
<i>That was pretty stupid grabbing
that gun. It's a felony.</i>

41:05.596 --> 41:08.656
<i>Suzi, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to-
You're afraid you're gonna have to what?</i>

41:08.732 --> 41:11.326
<i>She committed a felony, Margaret.</i>

41:11.402 --> 41:13.870
<i>She saved your life, Chief Tipton.</i>

41:13.938 --> 41:15.997
Well-

41:18.609 --> 41:21.772
We'll talk about it later.

41:21.846 --> 41:24.314
I'm not sure I agree
with everything you said, Margaret,

41:24.381 --> 41:27.043
but I have to admit...

41:27.117 --> 41:29.278
some of it made sense.

41:34.792 --> 41:37.761
How could I have been so blind?

41:37.828 --> 41:41.696
You weren't blind. Diana St. Cloud
is a very smart and charismatic woman.

41:41.765 --> 41:43.824
Everything she said was a lie.
No, no.

41:43.901 --> 41:46.392
What she said was true and right.

41:46.470 --> 41:48.529
Don't you remember
what I told you in the kitchen?

41:48.606 --> 41:52.406
- Don't confuse people and ideas.
- Diana spends five years in jail.

41:52.476 --> 41:56.606
And when she gets out, she becomes one of the
leading activists for changing the Constitution.

41:56.680 --> 42:01.208
Yeah. Uh, you got one more thing
to straighten out.

42:07.625 --> 42:09.684
Suzi, go wait in the car.
I wanna talk to your mother.

42:12.997 --> 42:15.363
<i>I had to come, Daddy.
This is it, Sam.</i>

42:15.432 --> 42:18.196
Ziggy says, uh, that George
is gonna move out.

42:18.269 --> 42:21.432
What do you want me to do, Margaret?
You left me no choice.

42:21.505 --> 42:24.201
<i>I'm moving out tonight.
You see? See?</i>

42:24.275 --> 42:28.211
You gotta fix it.
If that's what you have to do.

42:28.279 --> 42:32.215
<i>What? What are you sayin'?
Let me ask you one question.</i>

42:32.283 --> 42:35.775
Do you think you've had
a good marriage all these years?

42:35.853 --> 42:39.482
You know the answer to that.
No, I-I don't.

42:41.358 --> 42:43.724
I think we've had a great marriage.

42:43.794 --> 42:47.321
That's why I don't understand why
you're throwing it all away like this.

42:47.398 --> 42:50.128
Well, it seems to me like
you're the one who's throwing it all away.

42:52.803 --> 42:57.570
I don't know what to do. All of a
sudden, you're not my Margaret anymore.

42:57.641 --> 43:00.007
Who am I supposed to be
if you're not you?

43:00.077 --> 43:04.377
Maybe you could stop trying
to make me into "your Margaret"...

43:04.448 --> 43:06.575
and try finding out who I really am.

43:06.650 --> 43:10.484
And you could start that
by respecting me for my thoughts...

43:10.554 --> 43:13.284
and my ideas even if
they're different than yours.

43:15.326 --> 43:18.693
I'm too old to change who I am.
Only if you think you are.

43:18.762 --> 43:21.788
And only if you don't love your wife
and your children enough to try.

43:24.001 --> 43:25.935
I do love you very much, Margaret.

43:26.003 --> 43:29.632
Then try.

43:29.707 --> 43:31.834
That's all anybody can ask.

43:35.412 --> 43:36.845
Okay.

43:36.914 --> 43:40.111
Okay. All right.
All right, Sam. Great.

43:40.184 --> 43:43.779
Now, Ziggy says everything-
Okay.

43:43.854 --> 43:47.051
<i>Everything works outjust fine here.</i>

43:47.124 --> 43:49.524
Okay.
Um, Suzi and Margaret...

43:49.593 --> 43:52.187
<i>stay very active in the movement.</i>

43:52.262 --> 43:55.231
<i>In fact, a key in the push
for an Equal Rights Amendment.</i>

43:55.299 --> 43:57.927
And George gives Evy Brownfield...

43:58.002 --> 44:01.802
the promotion at full pay.

44:11.982 --> 44:14.951
<i>Well?</i>

44:16.253 --> 44:18.744
Well-Well-Well what?

44:18.822 --> 44:20.756
<i>What do you think?</i>

44:20.824 --> 44:25.352
Uh, could you, uh, repeat that question?

44:25.429 --> 44:30.298
<i>Is the size of a man's feet
related to the size ofhis love muscle?</i>

44:36.907 --> 44:38.898
<i>Dr. Ruth, are you there?</i>

44:40.611 --> 44:42.704
Oh, boy.
