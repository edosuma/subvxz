01:49.410 --> 01:53.574

- ( radio playing soft music )

01:53.680 --> 01:57.138
( pills rattling )

01:57.250 --> 01:59.878
Boy:
BUT WHY CAN'T I GO
TO SCHOOL TODAY?

02:01.720 --> 02:03.881
I TOLD YOU,

02:03.990 --> 02:06.550
I WANT YOU HOME WITH ME.

02:07.890 --> 02:09.653
WHO'S MY BOY?

02:09.760 --> 02:12.058
WHO'S MY BIG MAN?

02:12.160 --> 02:13.889
ME.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.093
( chuckles )
WHO NEEDS SCHOOL?

02:16.200 --> 02:19.169
BUT I LIKE SCHOOL.

02:19.270 --> 02:21.090
SO DID I.

02:21.200 --> 02:24.135
EVERYBODY FORGETS
MOMMY WAS SMART

02:24.240 --> 02:26.231
AND WENT
TO COLLEGE.

02:26.340 --> 02:30.174
THEY DON'T REALLY TEACH YOU
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW.

02:31.280 --> 02:34.044
LIKE WHY DO MEN
FLY THE COOP?

02:34.150 --> 02:36.812
THEY ALWAYS FLY THE COOP.

02:39.290 --> 02:41.656
EXCEPT FOR YOU, GEORGIE.

02:43.090 --> 02:45.081
- ( food sizzling )
- MOM.

02:45.190 --> 02:47.226
HMM?

02:47.330 --> 02:49.764
OH, CHRIST.

IT'S YOUR FAVORITE,

03:06.420 --> 03:08.741
FRIED BOLOGNA
AND VELVEETA.

03:10.520 --> 03:12.579
EAT IT.

03:20.030 --> 03:22.328
IT'S A STINKING LIFE, GEORGE.

03:22.430 --> 03:25.490
YOU TRY YOUR HARDEST TO WEAR
HIGH HEELS AND A GIRDLE.

03:25.600 --> 03:28.398
YOU GO TO WORK EVERY DAY
AND THINGS JUST GET WORSE.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.604
THAT'S THE WAY IT IS.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.805
WHAT ARE THOSE FOR?

03:34.910 --> 03:36.969
MM.

03:37.080 --> 03:40.015
MOMMY HURTS.

03:40.120 --> 03:43.044
WHAT IF YOU FALL DOWN AGAIN?

03:43.150 --> 03:45.812
I'LL TAKE A NAP RIGHT HERE.

03:48.360 --> 03:50.749
HOLD MY HAND.

03:52.230 --> 03:54.755
THE WHOLE TIME
YOU'RE ASLEEP?

03:54.860 --> 03:56.691
MM-HMM.

03:56.800 --> 03:59.189
WHAT IF I HAVE
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM?

03:59.300 --> 04:01.598
THEN GO TO THE BATHROOM,

04:01.700 --> 04:04.931
GET BACK HERE
ANHOLD MY HAND.

04:05.040 --> 04:07.474
GOD, SOMETIMES
YOU'RE SO STUPID.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.798
SORRY.

04:11.910 --> 04:14.640
LISTEN, I'M VERY TIRED.

04:14.750 --> 04:19.187
SO DON'T LET ANYBODY
WAKE ME UP. I MEAN IT!

04:19.290 --> 04:20.882
ALL RIGHT.
OW!

04:20.990 --> 04:22.855
OH.

04:26.930 --> 04:29.194
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

04:29.300 --> 04:31.291
DO YOU LOVE ME?

04:33.370 --> 04:35.361
YOU'RE MY LIFE, GEORGE.

04:35.470 --> 04:37.961
REMEMBER THAT.

04:38.070 --> 04:40.300
I WILL.

05:06.970 --> 05:08.562
( organ playing )

05:08.670 --> 05:11.901
( man speaking
foreign language )

05:15.380 --> 05:16.904
- ( whispers ) EXCUSE ME.
- HEY HEY HEY.

05:17.010 --> 05:19.478
- HI, GEORGE.
- HOW'RE YOU DOING?
EVERYTHING OKAY?

05:19.580 --> 05:21.377
I NEED TO GO IN THERE.

05:21.480 --> 05:23.846
ARE THEY FRIENDS
OF YOURS?

05:23.950 --> 05:27.511
NO, BUT THEY'VE SUFFERED
A TERRIBLE LOSS.

05:27.620 --> 05:29.622
WELL, THIS ONE'S
KIND OF PRIVATE.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.550
I'LL JUST SIT
IN THE BACK.

05:31.660 --> 05:33.355
AH, GEORGE,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:33.460 --> 05:35.599
THERE'S A FUNERAL LATER
THIS AFTERNOON.

05:35.700 --> 05:37.190
THEY'D LOVE
TO HAVE YOU.

05:37.300 --> 05:39.165
OKAY? SO, YEAH,
REALLY NICE PEOPLE.

05:39.270 --> 05:41.090
GO UPSTAIRS, I'LL TELL
YOU ALL ABOUT IT.

05:41.200 --> 05:44.306
- I'D LIKE TO BE
OF HELP IF I CAN.
- WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

05:44.410 --> 05:46.378
( clears throat )

05:46.480 --> 05:49.005
( minister speaking
foreign language )

05:52.080 --> 05:53.718
MYKONOS WAS INSANE.

05:53.820 --> 05:56.914
YOU'D MEET A BUNCH
OF BACKPACK PEOPLE
FROM ICELAND OR WHEREVER,

05:57.020 --> 06:00.148
AND WE'D ALL SWIM OUT
TO AN EMPTY CRUISER
AND PARTY ALL NIGHT.

06:00.260 --> 06:02.478
- ON SOME STRANGER'S BOAT?
- UH-HUH.

06:02.590 --> 06:04.729
- WHAT IF YOU GOT CAUGHT?
- NOBODY GAVE A FUCK.

06:04.830 --> 06:07.390
THEN SWIM BACK
IN THE MORNING
DRUNK, STONED,

06:07.500 --> 06:10.560
- AND LIE IN THE SUN.
- KISS.

06:15.600 --> 06:18.000
I'M A NEW MAN WITH YOU.

06:18.110 --> 06:21.170
YOU'VE CHANGED EVERYTHING.

06:21.280 --> 06:24.306
I HAVE? REALLY?

06:24.410 --> 06:27.072
CAN'T YOU TELL?

06:27.180 --> 06:29.489
I'M HAPPIER
THAN I'VE EVER BEEN.

06:31.590 --> 06:34.889
- AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF YOU.
- OH, STOP IT.

06:37.590 --> 06:41.196
LET'S STAY IN BED ALL DAY

06:41.300 --> 06:43.325
TALKING...

06:43.430 --> 06:46.399
- AND FUCKING.
- YES, PLEASE.

06:49.870 --> 06:51.633
YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:51.740 --> 06:55.130
I THINK WE NEED TO SPEND
A FEW YEARS IN EUROPE.

06:55.240 --> 06:57.401
- WHAT? LIKE LIVE THERE?
- MM-HMM.

06:57.510 --> 06:59.842
THEY DESPISE AMERICANS.
I DON'T NEED THAT.

06:59.950 --> 07:01.941
BUT IT WOULD BE SO GOOD
FOR YOUR ART.

07:02.050 --> 07:03.745
I MEAN, YOU WOULD REALLY
RIPEN OVER THERE.

07:03.850 --> 07:05.989
NOT FRANCE,
THAT'S TOO TIRED.

07:06.090 --> 07:08.684
I SEE US IN SPAIN.

07:08.790 --> 07:11.054
( laughs )
I DON'T KNOW.

07:11.160 --> 07:12.923
MM-HMM.

07:13.030 --> 07:14.759
WHERE IN SPAIN?

07:14.860 --> 07:16.794
GRANADA.

07:16.900 --> 07:17.924
( chuckles )

07:18.030 --> 07:20.066
- BARCELONA.
- MM.

07:20.170 --> 07:21.933
BARCELONA.

07:22.040 --> 07:24.361
AND THE ISLANDS.

07:24.470 --> 07:26.506
MALLORCA.

07:27.340 --> 07:28.876
MINORCA.

07:30.410 --> 07:33.072
- IBIZA.
- IBIZA?

07:33.180 --> 07:34.272
UH-HUH.

07:34.380 --> 07:37.178
DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING.
THERE'S A SYSTEM.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.042
OKAY, OKAY.

07:39.150 --> 07:40.959
OH, AND THIS IS?

07:41.060 --> 07:43.585
YOUR COPY OF THE FIRST HALF
OF THE FIRST PART

07:43.690 --> 07:45.749
OF THE L.A. COUNTY
ADOPTION APPLICATION.

07:45.860 --> 07:48.294
- UH, BUT I ALREADY
SIGNED EVERYTHING.

07:48.400 --> 07:51.767
OUR APPOINTMENT IS TOMORROW.
IF WE'RE NOT ON TOP

07:51.870 --> 07:54.338
SHIRLEY WILL KICK
OUR "GAY DADDY" ASSES

07:54.440 --> 07:56.192
( chuckles )

07:56.300 --> 07:58.302
AND THIS PILE IS?

07:58.410 --> 07:59.707

07:59.810 --> 08:02.802
"FERTILITY FUTU RES"
SURROGACY MATERIALS.

08:02.910 --> 08:05.879

08:05.980 --> 08:08.676
- OUR APPOINTMENT THERE IS?
- DAY AFI'ER TOMORROW.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.714
WE GET TO TALK
TO THE SURROGATE ALONE.

08:10.820 --> 08:14.210
- DID YOU SEND THE COUNTY
YOUR ANGER MANAGEMENT STUFF?
- YEAH, I THINK SO.

08:14.320 --> 08:15.958
YOU POUNDED SOME GUY
TO A BLOODY PULP.

08:16.060 --> 08:18.449
THEY HAVE TO HAVE
A PAPER THAT SAYS YOU
WON'T DO THAT AGAIN.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.050
I SENT IT.
I'M POSITIVE.

08:20.160 --> 08:22.196
THEY HAVE A RECORD
OF YOUR ASSAULT
AGAINST ROGER?

08:22.300 --> 08:24.996
ASSAULT, THAT IS
SO RIDICULOUS. YES.

08:25.100 --> 08:28.160
DID YOU GET HIS AFFIDAVIT
ABOUT DROPPING THE CHARGES,

08:28.270 --> 08:29.908
- ET CETERA?
- OH SHIT.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.433
CALL HIM.
WE NEED IT TODAY
SO I CAN SCAN IT

08:32.540 --> 08:34.679
AND MAKE COPIES TO STAPLE
TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL--

08:34.780 --> 08:38.147
- YOU ARE SUCH A MOM.
-(laughs)

08:38.250 --> 08:40.741
YOU ARE.

08:48.660 --> 08:52.380
WELL, THEN,
I'M GONNA GO
RUN SOME ERRANDS.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.924
ANYBODY NEED ANYTHING?
HAPPY TO HELP.

08:55.030 --> 08:57.590
OH, NO, THANKS, DEAR.
I HAVE TO GO THE MARKET
ANYWAY.

08:57.700 --> 08:59.998
- I CAN DO THAT.
- OR I CAN.

09:00.100 --> 09:02.398
OH, NO, IT'S ONLY
A FEW LI'I'I'LE THINGS
I HAVE IN MY HEAD.

09:02.500 --> 09:05.606
- George: MAKE A LIST.
- AND I'LL PICK THEM UP
ON THE WAY BACK.

09:05.710 --> 09:08.770
- THAT'S WHERE I'M GOING.
- THAT'S NICE, BUT IT'S EASIER
IF I GET EVERYTHING.

09:08.880 --> 09:10.609
THERE'S NO REASON
FOR YOU TO FETCH AND CARRY
FOR US, NATE.

09:10.710 --> 09:13.042
I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO THE PRODUCE SECTION.

09:13.150 --> 09:15.209
RUTH, I'M GOING.

09:15.320 --> 09:17.618
AND I HAVE THINGS
TO DO IN THAT DIRECTION,
SO WE'LL BOTH--

09:17.720 --> 09:19.654
I'M GOING UPSTAIRS
TO GET DRESSED.

09:19.760 --> 09:22.786
OKAY, I'LL MAKE A LIST.

09:24.130 --> 09:26.485
YOU HEARD. HE WOULDN'T
LET ME STOP HIM.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.660
IT'LL BE OKAY.
IT'S ONE OF HIS GOOD DAYS.

09:29.770 --> 09:33.365
I DON'T THINK SO.
HE JUST TRIED TO CRASH
A FUNERAL IN HIS BATHROBE.

09:33.470 --> 09:35.028
YOU CAN'T EXPECT HIM
TO BE PERFECT.

09:35.140 --> 09:36.960
I DON'T EXPECT HIM
TO BE PERFECT.

09:37.070 --> 09:38.935
I JUST WANT THE POOR GUY
TO BE SAFE.

09:51.020 --> 09:52.988
MAYBE I OULD SEE
YOUR SUPERVISOR.

09:53.090 --> 09:54.785
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE
READY FOR ME.

09:54.890 --> 09:57.427
YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT.

09:57.530 --> 10:00.124
BUT, UM,
NOW THAT WE'RE HERE...

10:00.230 --> 10:02.721
I'M A VERY COMPLEX PERSON.

10:04.470 --> 10:06.529
I'M SURE YOU ARE.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.596
I KEEP ENDING UP HOSPITALS.

10:08.700 --> 10:09.837
REALLY?

10:09.940 --> 10:11.965
WELL, TELL ME ABOUT THAT.

10:12.070 --> 10:14.777
OH, A FEW TIMES
FOR ANOREXIA.

10:14.880 --> 10:18.372
TWICE FOR ALCOHOL
POISONING.

10:18.480 --> 10:20.209
ONCE I HIT AN ARTERY.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.914
I'M A CU'I'I'ER.

10:23.020 --> 10:26.148
AND I KEEP PULLING
MY HAIR OUT.

10:26.250 --> 10:27.911
SO I SEE.

10:30.690 --> 10:33.659
THERE'S ALL THIS PRESSURE
TO BE NORMAL.

10:33.760 --> 10:35.694
AND I CAN'T.

10:35.800 --> 10:37.927
AND NOBODY UNDERSTANDS.

10:40.100 --> 10:41.897
I THINK I DO.

10:44.910 --> 10:47.435
Brenda:
I GUESS I EXPECTED
A FEW BODY-IMAGE ISSUES,

10:47.540 --> 10:49.474
BUT IT'S EVERY GIRL
WHO WALKS IN THE DOOR.

10:49.580 --> 10:51.673
Jackie:
I KNOW. I HAD A KID
THIS MORNING,

10:51.780 --> 10:52.974
SHE ONLY EATS
ON SATURDAYS.

10:53.080 --> 10:55.173
MINE, TWO BEERS
AND A CANDY BAR,

10:55.280 --> 10:57.589
THAT'S IT, EVERY DAY
FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS.

10:57.690 --> 10:59.510
I MEAN, JESUS, DO THEIR
FAMILIES NOT NOTICE

10:59.620 --> 11:01.713
THEIR DAUGHTERS
ARE EMACIATED?

11:01.820 --> 11:04.380
I KNOW. YOU KNOW,
I WAS A FAT GIRL.

11:04.490 --> 11:06.799
- NAH.
- OH, YEAH.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.323
- 204 LBS.!
- NO WAY!

11:09.430 --> 11:12.866
YEAH.
WHY DO YOU THINK
I HAVE SO MUCH COMPASSION?

11:12.970 --> 11:15.530
DID YOU STARVE IT OFF?

11:15.640 --> 11:17.801
OH, GOD, I TRIED.
BUT I WAS TOO WEAK.

11:17.910 --> 11:20.174
THOSE ANORECTICS ARE MADE
OF STEEL, YOU KNOW?

11:20.280 --> 11:22.271
( laughs )

11:22.380 --> 11:24.405
SO HOW'D YOU LOSE IT?

11:24.510 --> 11:26.000
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

11:26.110 --> 11:28.169
I'M BEAUTIFUL
NO MATTER HOW MUCH I WEIGH.

11:28.280 --> 11:31.181
NO, I NEED TO KNOW.
AS A THERAPIST IT WILL
HELP ME.

11:31.290 --> 11:32.609
WAS IT 12 STEPS?

11:32.720 --> 11:35.086
- OH, YEAH?
- HYPNOTHERAPY?

11:36.320 --> 11:38.083
SPEED.

11:38.190 --> 11:39.452
YEAH, SEE?

11:39.560 --> 11:41.198
IT'S TERRIBLE.
DON'T TELL.

11:41.300 --> 11:42.995
YOU'RE A FINE EXAMPLE!

11:43.100 --> 11:45.466
HEY, IT'S FUCKING HARD
TO BE A FAT GIRL.

11:45.570 --> 11:48.767
( George humming )

11:56.180 --> 11:57.772
( baby coos )

11:57.880 --> 12:00.440
THESE ARE FROM CHILE.

12:00.550 --> 12:04.145
ISN'T IT AMAZING
THE VARIETY OF APPLES
YOU CAN GET NOWADAYS?

12:04.250 --> 12:06.445
WE LIKE THE FUJIS.

12:06.550 --> 12:08.950
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY,
ISN'T IT?

12:09.060 --> 12:12.382
Loretta:
THOUGHT YOU'D BEEN FEELING
A LITTLE OFF LATELY.

12:12.490 --> 12:16.859
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
51 YEARS AGO TODAY
YOU LET ME DIE.

12:17.700 --> 12:20.089
NO!

12:20.200 --> 12:22.191
YOU OKAY?

12:23.540 --> 12:25.667
NO.

12:25.770 --> 12:28.079
NO.

12:31.580 --> 12:34.378
- ( dance music playing )
- Roger: HE WAS A GYMNAST.
STATE GYMNAST FROM IOWA.

12:34.480 --> 12:37.779
JUST WEDGED
HIMSELF BETWEEN THE SLATS,
WENT ACROSS LIKE SPIDERMAN.

12:37.890 --> 12:39.619
KEITH! DAVID!

12:39.720 --> 12:43.349
THIS IS HAL AND HAL'S
FRIEND CRI'I'I'ER.

12:46.690 --> 12:49.329
WE'RE BEING BAD.
HAL FIRED UP THE BLENDER

12:49.430 --> 12:52.160
AND SUDDENLY DAIQUIRIS
WERE LITI'ERING
THE LANDSCAPE.

12:52.270 --> 12:54.261
CARE TO INDULGE?

12:57.110 --> 12:59.977
BETI'ER NOT.
THERE'S THE MEETING
TOMORROW.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.332
RIGHT RIGHT.
WHAT AM I THINKING?

13:02.440 --> 13:05.170
KEITH AND DAVID ARE
GOING TO BE FATHERS.

13:05.280 --> 13:07.373
- WOO-HOO!
- CONGRATULATIONS!

13:07.480 --> 13:11.382
I JUST WANTED
TO MAKE SURE WE HAD A COPY
OF YOUR LETI'ER IN HAND.

13:11.490 --> 13:12.809
OF COURSE!

13:12.920 --> 13:15.013
I'LL GET IT
SO YOU CAN RELAX.

13:15.120 --> 13:17.281
IT'S SIGNED, WITN ESSED,
NOTARIZED.

13:17.390 --> 13:19.153
CAUTERIZED, CIRCUMCISED.

13:21.730 --> 13:24.028
AND YOU KNOW
ROGER BECAUSE?

13:24.130 --> 13:26.837
HE'S HELPING
WITH MY CAREER.

13:26.940 --> 13:29.261
- SO YOU'RE AN ACTOR?
- YEAH, WELL, SOON.

13:29.370 --> 13:32.203
YOU KNOW,
MOSTLY I'VE BEEN
DOING MODELING.

13:32.310 --> 13:34.175
BUT I'M, LIKE,
BORING, YOU KNOW?

13:34.280 --> 13:36.840
- I NEED TO CUT
LOOSE A LITTLE.
- YEAH.

13:36.950 --> 13:40.169
- NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.
- HAL IS GOING TO BE HUGE!

13:40.280 --> 13:43.579
- Critter:
HMM, DEFINITELY!
- WELL...

13:46.960 --> 13:49.656
DAVID, IT'S BEEN MONTHS.

13:49.760 --> 13:51.318
I'VE BEEN WELL BEHAVED.

13:51.430 --> 13:52.749
I EMPLOY YOUR HUSBAND.

13:52.860 --> 13:55.294
I THINK I'VE PROVED
I'M NOT SATAN.

13:55.400 --> 13:56.492
YEAH, YOU HAVE.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.488
- PRE'I'I'Y MUCH.
-(laughs)

13:58.600 --> 14:01.364
( sighs )
THANK YOU, ROGER.

14:01.470 --> 14:03.358
HERE'S TO CHILDREN.

14:03.470 --> 14:07.076
- Hal: ALL RIGHT.
- MAY THEY BE WANTED
AND LOVED JUST AS THEY ARE.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.909
BECAUSE ANYTHING LESS
IS HELL,

14:09.010 --> 14:11.046
AS WE ALL KNOW.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.943
* I NEARLY LOST MY WAY

14:18.050 --> 14:20.883
* BUT I DON'T WANT
TO LOSE YOU *

14:20.990 --> 14:24.153
* I'M TRYING TO GET THROUGH
TO YOU *

14:24.260 --> 14:29.823
* WHERE DO WE GO
FROM HERE? *

14:29.930 --> 14:34.765
* I HEARD OUR SONG
ON THE RADIO *

14:34.870 --> 14:41.469
* AND WHERE DO WE GO
FROM HERE? *

14:41.580 --> 14:44.640
* I JUST CALLED
'CAUSE I WANT TO KNOW *

14:44.750 --> 14:49.449
* WHERE DO WE GO
FROM HERE? *

14:51.320 --> 14:52.878
( laughs )

14:52.990 --> 14:55.550
HEY! WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

14:55.660 --> 14:59.585
- SAME AS YOU,
LOOKING FOR A DATE.
- HMM.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.794
DOESN'T THIS REMIND YOU
OF A MOVIE?

15:01.900 --> 15:05.267
TWO PEOPLE WHO GOT
A DIVORCE MEET AT A SINGLES
NIGHT AND THEY--

15:05.370 --> 15:07.031
NO!

15:07.140 --> 15:09.631
I THOUGHT YOU WERE HOOKED
UP WITH THE HOCKEY PLAYER.

15:09.740 --> 15:12.129
THAT WAS JUST SEX.

15:12.240 --> 15:14.401
I DON'T NEED TO HEAR
ABOUT IT.

15:14.510 --> 15:16.205
WHY NOT? WE'RE ADULTS.
ADULTS HAVE SEX.

15:16.310 --> 15:18.676
WE DON'T HAVE TO BE ASHAMED
TO SAY IT OUT LOUD.

15:18.780 --> 15:20.941
I JUST THINK YOU'RE
BETTER THAN THAT.

15:23.920 --> 15:26.718
YOU WANNA COME BY AND SEE
THE KIDS TOMORROW?

15:26.820 --> 15:28.515
I CAN'T.

15:28.620 --> 15:31.623
I'VE GOT TO GO TO IRVINE
FOR A FUNERAL DIRECTOR'S
CONFERENCE.

15:31.730 --> 15:33.288
UGH! FUN.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.753
YEAH. WHOO.

15:34.860 --> 15:37.328
-(laughs)
- A REALLY GOOD TIME.

15:37.430 --> 15:39.261
CHEER UP, RICO.

15:39.370 --> 15:42.396
GO ON, MINGLE.
CALL THE BOYS
WHEN YOU GET BACK.

15:42.500 --> 15:44.559
OH, THERE'S THAT MAN
I WANT TO TALK TO.

15:48.640 --> 15:51.803
- HI. HOW ARE YOU?
I'M VAHNIESSA.

15:51.910 --> 15:53.969
Vanessa:
HAVEN'T I SEEN YOU
AT 10:00 MASS?

15:54.080 --> 15:56.378
Joe doesn't know
about the party.

15:56.480 --> 15:58.289
It's a surprise.
Shh!

15:58.390 --> 16:02.656
Mr. Salt:
We need lots of help getting
ready for the party.

16:04.160 --> 16:07.527
- HEY, YOU.
- HEY, YOU.

16:07.630 --> 16:10.667
-HEY,YOU!
-(laughs)

16:10.770 --> 16:12.692
Brenda:
YOU HUNGRY?

16:12.800 --> 16:15.894
UM, NO, THANK YOU.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.106
I HAD A GARDEN BURGER
IN THE CAR.

16:19.210 --> 16:22.031
- ARE YOU SURE YOU SHOULD
BE EATING THAT?
- WHY NOT?

16:23.110 --> 16:25.078
- THAT LETThllJﬁE IS GRAY.

16:25.180 --> 16:26.772
- LOOK AT THAT.
- Nate: WOW.

16:26.880 --> 16:30.884
FUNNY. THERE'S PASTA
FROM THE OTHER NIGHT
IN THE FRIDGE.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.185
REALLY, ALL I WANT
IS A SHOWER.

16:34.620 --> 16:37.748
HEY, IS THERE ANYTHING
INTERNAL I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?

16:37.860 --> 16:39.020
HMM?

16:39.130 --> 16:41.189
- EGG-WISE.
- OH.

16:41.300 --> 16:44.861
GOD, I FORGOT
FOR ONCE.

16:44.970 --> 16:47.063
UM, NO.

16:47.170 --> 16:48.637
- THANK YOU FOR ASKING.
- MM-HMM.

16:48.740 --> 16:51.368
AND MOM WANTS US TO COME
FOR DINNER TOMORROW NIGHT.

16:51.470 --> 16:54.234
OH, NATE, WE WERE
JUST THERE LAST WEEK.

16:54.340 --> 16:56.376
GEORGE LIKES TO SPEND
TIME WITH MAYA

16:56.480 --> 16:58.402
AND I REALLY THINK MY MOM
COULD USE THE RELIEF.

16:58.510 --> 17:01.240
- IT'S EXCRUCIATING.
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.

17:01.350 --> 17:04.183
- NO, I'LL GO.
- Maya: HE'S FUNNY.

17:04.290 --> 17:07.316
( Maya laughs )
YOU'RE FUNNY.

17:07.420 --> 17:09.456
Billy:
YEAH, YEAH, I'M SERIOUS.

17:09.560 --> 17:12.188
THE WAY THINGS
ARE GOING IN THIS COUNTRY
WE'RE GETTING OUT.

17:12.290 --> 17:14.520
NO, NOT ITALY.
THAT'S A CLICHE.

17:14.630 --> 17:17.269
WE'RE NOT TAKING A SEMESTER
IN FUCKING FLORENCE.

17:17.370 --> 17:19.497
WE ARE BUILDING
OUR LIVES THERE.

17:19.600 --> 17:21.090
YEAH, MAYBE SPAIN.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.065
OR, WAIT, PORTUGAL.

17:23.170 --> 17:26.401
OH OH OH,
MOROCCO.

17:26.510 --> 17:29.308
WAIT. I STILL KNOW PEOPLE.
WHAT TIME IS IT OVER THERE?

17:29.410 --> 17:31.742
WELL, WHAT TIME IS IT
RIGHT NOW?

17:31.850 --> 17:33.818
OKAY OKAY.
OKAY OKAY OKAY.

17:37.920 --> 17:41.617
WE ALL KNOW
THAT THIS PROCEDURE
IS COST PROHIBITIVE,

17:41.720 --> 17:43.256
YET FASCINATING.

17:43.360 --> 17:45.885
SO AS A RESEARCH
EXPERIMENT

17:45.990 --> 17:48.527
I COMMITTED MYSELF
TO WATERLESS EMBALMING

17:48.630 --> 17:50.291
FOR SEVEN MONTHS.

17:50.400 --> 17:53.460
THIS FOR MANY OF US
IS THE ROAD NOT TAKEN.

17:53.570 --> 17:56.698
BUT I DIVERGED
IN THE YELLOW WOOD

17:56.800 --> 17:59.268
TO DEVELOP BETTER TECHNIQUES
FOR THOSE SITUATIONS

17:59.370 --> 18:02.430
IN WHICH THERE
MAY BE NO HZO.

18:02.540 --> 18:04.007
LET US COMPARE.

18:04.110 --> 18:06.578
TYPICALLY,
THE ANHYDROUS PROCESS

18:06.680 --> 18:09.148
WOULD INVOLVES 16 OUNCES
ARTERIAL FLUID,

18:09.250 --> 18:12.117
32 OUNCES HUMECTANT,

18:12.220 --> 18:14.484
OR HUMECT ANT
CO-INJECT ION MIX,

18:14.590 --> 18:17.627
PLUS 32 OUNCES
WATER TREATMENT.

18:17.730 --> 18:21.154
RESULTING IN A FINAL
DILUTION STRENGTH

18:21.260 --> 18:25.663
OF 3-4°/o HCHO.

18:25.770 --> 18:29.490
NOW IN A TYPICAL
CONVENTIONAL EMBALMING

18:29.600 --> 18:31.500
THE NUMBERS WOULD BE
SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT.

18:31.610 --> 18:36.604
WITH 10-12 OUNCES
ARTERIAL FLUID,

18:36.710 --> 18:38.007
EIGHT OUNCES HUMECTANT,

18:38.110 --> 18:40.317
OR HUMECTANT
CO-INJECTION MIX...

18:40.420 --> 18:43.184
OKAY.
GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.588
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- YOU GUYS TAKE CARE.

18:51.830 --> 18:55.220
- ( laughs) HEY.
- HEY.

18:56.160 --> 18:58.720
"FISHER & DIAZ"

18:58.830 --> 19:01.196
HEY, DO YOU KNOW
FISHER & SONS?

19:01.300 --> 19:04.201
WELL, FISHER & DIAZ
USED TO BE FISHER & SONS.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.505
SEE, I OWN PART
OF THE BUSINESS NOW.

19:06.610 --> 19:09.807
THE SAME PLACE.
MAN, THAT IS CRAZY.

19:09.910 --> 19:12.401
- I WORKED THERE.
- NO.

19:12.510 --> 19:13.374
REALLY?

19:13.480 --> 19:16.017
- "ANGELA."
- YOU'RE FEDERICO.

19:16.120 --> 19:18.680
YOU WENT OVER TO KROENER
FOR A WHILE, RIGHT?

19:18.790 --> 19:20.519
THAT'S WHEN I CAME IN.

19:20.620 --> 19:22.850
I REMEMBER YOUR WORK
FROM THE BOARD.

19:22.960 --> 19:24.723
- YOU ROCK!
-(laughs)

19:24.830 --> 19:27.196
AND I'M PRETTY GOOD MYSELF,
SO I SHOULD KNOW.

19:27.300 --> 19:28.949
THANK YOU.

19:29.060 --> 19:30.994
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

19:31.100 --> 19:34.263
OF COURSE THEY FIRED ME,
THE FISHERS.

19:34.370 --> 19:36.838
I BROKE A GLASS,
YOU KNOW.

19:36.940 --> 19:40.432
THEY ACTED LIKE
I MURDERED SOMEBODY
OR FUCKED A BODY!

19:40.540 --> 19:42.201
-(laughs)
- OR WHATEVER!

19:42.310 --> 19:44.642
I DON'T WANNA DIS
YOUR PARTNERS.

19:44.750 --> 19:46.479
YOU'RE AWESOME!

19:46.580 --> 19:50.209
HEY, ARE YOU GONNA GO
TO ADVANCED ANATOMY
FOR RESTORATIVE ART?

19:50.320 --> 19:51.981
YEAH. YEAH, I AM.

19:52.090 --> 19:54.411
WELL, GOOD.
WE CAN SIT TOGETHER.

19:54.520 --> 19:57.227
- I'LL BE YOUR GROUPIE.
-(laughs)

19:57.330 --> 20:00.151
I MEAN, YOUR WIFE
WON'T MIND, WILL SHE?

20:00.260 --> 20:02.023
UH, EX-WIFE.

20:02.130 --> 20:04.189
I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF A DIVORCE RIGHT NOW.

20:04.300 --> 20:06.188
OH, TOO BAD

20:06.300 --> 20:08.063
THAT SUCKS.

20:08.170 --> 20:10.502
( chuckles )

20:10.610 --> 20:13.704
WELL, LET'S GO.
WE WANNA GET A GOOD
SEAT, RIGHT?

20:13.810 --> 20:15.505
WOW!

20:15.610 --> 20:18.602
- YOU'RE A FUCKING LIAR!
- YOU CAN READ THE LETTER
YOURSELF.

20:18.710 --> 20:21.679
THIS COUNSELING IS MANDATORY
OR YOU WILL BE SUSPENDED.

20:21.780 --> 20:25.489
- THIS IS FUCKING BULLSHIT!
- THAT DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING.

20:25.590 --> 20:27.285
YOU HAVE NO FUCKING
RIGHT TO DO THIS TO ME!

20:27.390 --> 20:29.654
LISTEN, NOLAN, I'M NOT
DOING ANYTHING TO YOU.

20:29.760 --> 20:33.082
- IT HAS NOTHING TO DO--
- BITCH, DON'T TELL ME
WHAT TO DO!

20:33.190 --> 20:34.498
( groans )

20:34.600 --> 20:37.421
( muttering )
THIS IS FUCKING BULLSHIT.

20:40.130 --> 20:41.734
I MISS YOU.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.307
IT'S BEEN TWO HOURS.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.765
I'M GETTING A NEW CAMERA.

20:45.870 --> 20:47.701
YOU'RE GONNA SHIT.

20:47.810 --> 20:49.368
IT'S DIGITAL.

20:49.480 --> 20:51.675
( laughs )
BECAUSE I WANT TO TRY IT.

20:51.780 --> 20:54.169
I WANT TO FIND OUT FOR MYSELF
WHAT DIGITAL CAN DO.

20:54.280 --> 20:56.510
I KNOW YOU'RE A PURIST.

20:56.620 --> 20:59.145
JUST THINK OF IT
AS A REAL EXPENSIVE TOY.

20:59.250 --> 21:02.413
OKAY, LATER.
I LOVE YOU.

21:03.990 --> 21:05.526
IT'S DECLINED.

21:05.630 --> 21:08.224
OH, NO. THAT'S A MISTAKE.
YOUR COMPUTER'S SCREWED UP.

21:08.330 --> 21:09.592
DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER CARD?

21:09.700 --> 21:12.294
NO.
TRY THAT ONE AGAIN.
IT WORKS.

21:18.370 --> 21:19.860
HMM. DECLINED.

21:21.240 --> 21:22.798
WHAT THE FUCK?

21:24.350 --> 21:26.944
- I'M SORRY.
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

21:27.050 --> 21:29.974
YOU HAVE OUR WHOLE LIVES
THERE ON PAPER. WHAT MAKES
US UNSUITABLE PARENTS?

21:30.080 --> 21:32.810
KEITH DID EVERYTHING
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO DO.
HIS RECORD IS CLEAN.

21:32.920 --> 21:35.980
BUT YOURS IS NOT.

21:36.090 --> 21:37.455
WHAT?

21:37.560 --> 21:39.289
LOOK, I WISH YOU'D BEEN
MORE HONEST WITH ME.

21:39.390 --> 21:41.324
IT WOULD HAVE SAVED US ALL
A LOT OF WORK.

21:41.430 --> 21:44.092
- WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN?
- DAVID.

21:44.200 --> 21:46.964
YOU WERE ARRESTED
IN LAS VEGAS

21:47.070 --> 21:49.561
ON MAY 25TH, 2001

21:49.670 --> 21:51.763
FOR LUDE
AND LASCIVIOUS BEHAVIOR

21:51.870 --> 21:54.998
IN A PUBLIC PLACE
WITH A MALE PROSTITUTE.

22:00.010 --> 22:02.410
I AM SO DISAPPOINTED.

22:02.520 --> 22:05.739
I'VE DEVOTED WEEKS
TO YOUR CASE.

22:05.850 --> 22:08.853
DID YOU REALLY THINK
THAT YOU COULD KEEP
IT A SECRET?

22:13.330 --> 22:15.218
- YOU FUCKED UP.
- I DID NOT.

22:15.330 --> 22:17.469
YOU TOLD ME
YOU TOOK CARE OF IT.

22:17.570 --> 22:19.663
YOU SAID THE ARREST
WAS EXPUNGED.

22:19.770 --> 22:21.863
THAT'S WHAT THE VEGAS
COP SAID.

22:21.970 --> 22:24.666
LOOK, I DIDN'T MAKE YOU
FUCK THAT HOOKER AND GET BUSTED.

22:24.770 --> 22:27.330
THAT SMUG DYKE SHIRLEY
RUBS IT IN MY FACE.

22:27.440 --> 22:29.203
YOU FUCKED UP
AND IT COST US EVERYTHING!

22:29.310 --> 22:32.370
THE ONLY REASON
I'M NOT SCREAMING BACK
AT YOU RIGHT NOW

22:32.480 --> 22:34.175
IS BECAUSE I KNOW
HOW UPSET YOU ARE.

22:34.280 --> 22:36.544
WHY AM I THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S UPSET?

22:36.650 --> 22:39.016
- WHY AREN'T YOU
FREAKING OUT?
- I AM UPSET.

22:39.120 --> 22:42.317
BUT I HAVE TO DRIVE THE CAR
AND GET US HOME ALIVE
WHILE YOU FREAK OUT!

22:42.420 --> 22:44.627
BULLSHIT!
YOU DON'T CARE!

22:44.730 --> 22:48.154
I DO CARE!
BUT IT DIDN'T COST US
EVERYTHING.

22:48.260 --> 22:51.388
THERE'S A SURROGATE,
MAYBE WE CAN GET THINGS
GOING WITH HER?

22:51.500 --> 22:53.434
YOU NEVER WANTED TO ADOPT
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

22:53.540 --> 22:56.964
FUCK THE SURROGATE.
YOU CAN MEET HER YOURSELF.
I DON'T WANT ANY PART OF IT.

22:57.070 --> 22:58.935
OKAY.

23:01.210 --> 23:04.202
( sobs )

23:04.310 --> 23:06.141
I MEAN, I KNEW
HE WAS PISSED OFF,

23:06.250 --> 23:08.172
BUT I DID NOT
SEE IT COMING.

23:08.280 --> 23:09.611
YOU KNOW, BOOM!

23:09.720 --> 23:12.541
JUST BOUNCES ME OFF
THE WALL TWICE.

23:12.650 --> 23:16.359
YOU HAVE TO BE MORE CAREFUL
WITH THESE KIDS WHEN YOU DON'T
KNOW THEIR PATHOLOGY.

23:16.460 --> 23:18.621
HE SCARED
THE SHIT OUT OF ME.

23:18.730 --> 23:20.254
YEAH.

23:20.360 --> 23:22.692
GETS THE ADRENALINE
PUMPING, DOESN'T IT?

23:22.800 --> 23:24.392
YEAH.

23:25.630 --> 23:27.393
OH, AND I'M SUPPOSED
TO HAVE DINNER

23:27.500 --> 23:32.005
AT MY MOTHER-IN-LAW'S TONIGHT.
OH, HOW DEPRESSING.

23:32.110 --> 23:34.431
WHY DON'T YOU COME HOME
AND HAVE DINNER WITH US?

23:34.540 --> 23:37.543
YOU KNOW, DECOMPRESS
WITH THE WACKY FELDMANS.

23:37.650 --> 23:40.346
- OKAY.
- GREAT!

23:40.450 --> 23:42.509
I'D LOVE TO.

23:42.620 --> 23:45.987
SO THEN I CALLED THE BANK
AND THEY SAID THERE HAD BEEN
NO MONEY DEPOSITED.

23:46.090 --> 23:48.513
CAN YOU FIX THIS PLEASE?
I HAVE TO GET A NEW CAMERA.

23:48.620 --> 23:50.884
CLAIRE, YOU'RE NOT ENROLLED
IN COLLEGE THIS QUARTER.

23:50.990 --> 23:53.356
- WHO TOLD YOU THAT?
- Your mother.

23:53.460 --> 23:55.758
You should have told me
yourself.

23:55.860 --> 23:57.999
I'M TAKING SOME TIME OFF.
SO WHAT?

23:58.100 --> 24:01.763
SO, YOU CAN'T
ACCESS THE FUNDS.
I'M SORRY.

24:01.870 --> 24:04.100
I BEG YOUR PARDON.
THAT IS MY MONEY.

24:04.210 --> 24:07.577
- MY FATHER GAVE IT TO ME.
- He set up a trust to pay
for your education,

24:07.680 --> 24:10.547
not support your lifestyle
outside of the classroom.

24:10.650 --> 24:12.470
IT IS NOT MY LIFESTYLE,
IT IS MY LIFE!

24:12.580 --> 24:16.038
AND I'M LEARNING MORE NOW
THAN I EVER DID IN THAT
PRETENTIOUS ART BARN!

24:16.150 --> 24:19.586
YOU DON'T INHERIT
FREE AND CLEAR UNTIL YOU'RE 25.
THE LANGUAGE IS VERY SPECIFIC.

24:19.690 --> 24:22.409
THIS IS, LIKE,
BUREAUCRATIC BULLSHIT!

24:22.520 --> 24:24.158
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO MOVE TO EUROPE

24:24.260 --> 24:26.558
AND FUCKING RIPEN WHEN YOU
WON'T GIVE ME MY MONEY?

24:26.660 --> 24:29.993
Your mother and I
discussed this and we feel
it's in your best interest.

24:30.100 --> 24:31.590
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ME!

24:31.700 --> 24:34.533
SHIT!
SHIT!

24:39.270 --> 24:42.171
- Angela: AND HE'S
WAVING HIS DICK AT ME!
- Rico: OH, MAN.

24:42.280 --> 24:44.999
AND SO I TOLD HIM,
NOTHING'S EVER GOING
TO HAPPEN

24:45.110 --> 24:47.874
- TILL YOU WAX YOUR BACK
AND YCCJJ'lJ-IR ASS.

24:47.980 --> 24:50.813
AND, OH YEAH,
GET OUT OF MY HOT TUB,
YOU OLD GEEZER.

24:50.920 --> 24:53.411
-(laughs)
- I MEAN, WAS THAT WRONG?

24:53.520 --> 24:55.408
HELL, NO.
OH, GOD!

24:55.520 --> 24:58.421
YOU DIDN'T INVITE HIM
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

24:58.530 --> 25:00.259
( sighs )

25:01.230 --> 25:03.926
YOU ARE GODDAMN HOT!

25:04.030 --> 25:06.191
AND YOU KNOW IT.

25:06.300 --> 25:09.098
THE HAIR, THE FACE,

25:09.200 --> 25:12.533
THE WHOLE FRIGGING PACKAGE!

25:12.640 --> 25:15.803
( chuckles )

25:15.910 --> 25:18.344
YOU'RE PRETTY DAMN
HOT YOURSELF.

25:18.450 --> 25:20.179
YEAH !

25:20.280 --> 25:22.510
( laughs )
YEAH!

25:23.350 --> 25:25.511
OH, WOW.

25:25.620 --> 25:27.759
I WAS GONNA DRIVE HIM
TO FULLERTON TONIGHT,

25:27.860 --> 25:31.682
BUT, UM, I GUESS NOT.
( laughs )

25:36.460 --> 25:38.690
WE CAN GO BACK
TO MY ROOM.

25:38.800 --> 25:41.189
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

25:41.300 --> 25:44.201
I'M STARVING.
CAN WE ORDER SOME
ROOM SERVICE?

25:45.210 --> 25:47.303
( chuckles )

25:47.410 --> 25:49.776
I'M NOT STAYING HERE.

25:49.880 --> 25:53.543
I'M AT THE IRVINE CENTER
QUALITY INN DOWN THE BLOCK.

25:53.650 --> 25:57.211
( laughs )
THAT'S OKAY.

25:57.320 --> 25:58.844
WE'LL FIND SOMETHING.

25:58.950 --> 26:01.748
- ( chuckles )
- LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

26:03.460 --> 26:06.827
I, UH, SET THE TABLE.
ANYTHING ELSE I CAN
DO TO HELP?

26:06.930 --> 26:08.921
NO, DEAR.
YOU JUST STAY OUT
FROM UNDERFOOT.

26:09.030 --> 26:11.521
- I'LL DO EVERYTHING.
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

26:11.630 --> 26:13.666
IT'S YOUR JOB TO ENTERTAIN
THE GUESTS.

26:13.770 --> 26:16.364
YES, BUT I WANT
TO HELP YOU.

26:16.470 --> 26:19.837
SO YOU SAY, BUT THEN YOU
COME BACK FROM THE GROCERY
EMPTY-HANDED.

26:19.940 --> 26:22.670
- ( door opens )
- Nate: HEY HEY HEY,
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

26:22.780 --> 26:25.499
- THERE'S GRANDPA GEORGE.
- HELLO, THERE LITTLE ONE!

26:25.610 --> 26:27.749
- HOW'RE YOU DOING, MOM?
- FINE FINE.

26:27.850 --> 26:29.738
EVERYTHING'S FINE SO FAR.

26:29.850 --> 26:31.579
- OH, YEAH?
- WHERE'S BRENDA?

26:31.690 --> 26:35.751
UH, YOU KNOW,
SOMETHING CAME UP AT WORK.
SHE COULDN'T MAKE IT.

26:35.860 --> 26:39.057
HI. GOD,
I GOT SO LOST.

26:39.160 --> 26:42.823
THE 10, THE 5, THE 2,
THE 210, THE 101.

26:42.930 --> 26:45.467
- AM I LATE?
- UH, NATE, THIS IS
MY DAUGHTER MAGGIE.

26:45.570 --> 26:48.733
- NICE TO MEET YOU, MAGGIE.
- NO, YOU'RE RIGHT ON TIME.

26:48.840 --> 26:51.365
- HI, NATE.
- HI.

26:51.470 --> 26:53.938
- AND WHO IS THIS?
- THIS IS MAYA.

26:54.040 --> 26:56.429
- THAT'S MY DAUGHTER.
- HELLO, MAYA.

26:56.540 --> 26:58.804
IT'S GREAT TO SEE US
ALL TOGETHER.

26:58.910 --> 27:02.641
OKAY, OKAY.
EVERYONE IN THE DINING ROOM.
I HAVE TO FINISH DINNER.

27:04.350 --> 27:06.887
- HEY.
- HEY.

27:06.990 --> 27:09.709
- HONEY?
- SHOO SHOO!

27:15.660 --> 27:18.060
( Maya giggling )

27:20.700 --> 27:23.589
( chatting )

27:23.710 --> 27:25.439
Brenda:
HE HAD BEEN TURNING UP
TO CLASS DRUNK,

27:25.540 --> 27:27.872
WHICH WAS SOMETHING
THAT WE WERE BEGINNING
TO ADDRESS.

27:27.980 --> 27:31.006
- HE JUST WENT OFF ON HER.
- OH, BRENDA, THAT SUCKS.

27:31.110 --> 27:33.249
I KNOW, OCCUPATIONAL
HAZARD I GUESS.

27:33.350 --> 27:35.671
SURE, BUT STILL,
IT SUCKS.

27:35.780 --> 27:38.817
I SHOULD HAVE
JUST CALLED JACKIE RIGHT IN.

27:38.920 --> 27:41.457
THERE IS NOTHING MORE DANGEROUS
THAN AN ADOLESCENT MALE.

27:41.560 --> 27:43.255
NOT ME.
I JUST COOK.

27:43.360 --> 27:45.351
- HE MADE THE CHICKEN?
- Brenda: REALLY?

27:45.460 --> 27:47.121
I'M IMPRESSED.
IT'S DELICIOUS.

27:47.230 --> 27:50.654
THANKS.
"THE JOY OF COOKING."
A MONKEY COULD MAKE IT.

27:50.770 --> 27:52.465
MOM GOT KICKED
IN THE STOMACH ONCE.

27:52.570 --> 27:54.538
- REALLY?
- OH, THAT'S NOTHING.

27:54.640 --> 27:56.062
SOME KID THREW A PHONE
AT MARK ONCE.

27:56.170 --> 27:58.206
- YEAH.
- 10 STITCHES.
SO HE WINS.

27:58.310 --> 27:59.538
- NICE.
- HERE.

27:59.640 --> 28:01.801
- OH.
- Mark: WELL, NOT REALLY.

28:01.910 --> 28:03.878
HE HAD A REASON
TO THROW SOMETHING
BUT NOT AT ME.

28:03.980 --> 28:06.608
-(laughs)
- WAR STORIES
AND BATTLE SCARS.

28:06.710 --> 28:09.611
OUR PARENTS--
THERAPISTS ON THE FRONTLINES.

28:09.720 --> 28:13.508
- Mark: THAT'S US.
- YOU KNOW, MY PARENTS WERE
THERAPISTS, TOO.

28:13.620 --> 28:15.087
WELL, PSYCHOLOGIST,
PSYCHIATRIST.

28:15.190 --> 28:16.919
- Sylvia: REALLY?
- YEAH.

28:17.020 --> 28:18.658
SO YOU KNOW WHAT
WE GO THROUGH.

28:18.760 --> 28:20.250
WELL, I KNOW
WHAT I WENT THROUGH.

28:20.360 --> 28:23.989
TOO MANY HUGS.
ALL THAT SUPPORT
AND UNDERSTANDING.

28:24.100 --> 28:26.193
NOT EXACTLY.

28:26.300 --> 28:28.734
Sylvia:
IS YOUR HUSBAND A THERAPIST?

28:28.840 --> 28:31.263
NOT OFFICIALLY,
BUT SORT OF.

28:31.370 --> 28:34.931
SO DO YOU GUYS DISCUSS
EVERY LITTLE THING
TO DEATH?

28:35.040 --> 28:37.076
- I TRY.
- ( Sylvia laughs )

28:37.180 --> 28:40.604
ONCE WE HAD
TO DISCIPLINE JOSH.

28:40.710 --> 28:43.508
OH, AND THEY WERE ALL GUILTY
ABOUT PUNISHING HIM

28:43.620 --> 28:45.588
AND HE WAS CRYING.

28:45.690 --> 28:48.056
LIKE, "I KNOW THAT I HAVE
TO GO TO MY ROOM."

28:48.160 --> 28:50.458
"BUT WHY DO WE HAVE
TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT?"

28:50.560 --> 28:52.380
( all laugh )

28:52.490 --> 28:55.323
- Jackie: JOSHY.
- Mark: AND THAT WAS
JUST LAST WEEK.

28:55.430 --> 28:57.921
George:
HE WAS JUST WALKING
THROUGH THE JUNGLE ONE DAY

28:58.030 --> 29:00.897
AND A PARROT FLEW DOWN
AND LANDED ON HIS SHOULDER
AND SAID,

29:01.000 --> 29:02.763
"SAY, ISN'T YOUR NAME
GEORGE?"

29:02.870 --> 29:05.065
HE SAID, "YEAH, IT IS.
HOW DID YOU KNOW?"

29:05.170 --> 29:08.731
OH, THOSE PARROTS
KNOW A LOT OF THINGS,
DON'T THEY?

29:08.840 --> 29:12.344
MY FATHER IS REALLY ATTACHED
TO YOUR LITTLE GIRL.

29:12.450 --> 29:15.908
YEAH. IT TOOK THEM
A LITTLE WHILE, BUT THEY'VE
GOT IT GOING ON NOW.

29:16.020 --> 29:18.545
- SHE'S SO ADORABLE.
- YEAH.

29:18.650 --> 29:20.686
BEST THING THAT EVER
HAPPENED TO ME.

29:20.790 --> 29:24.055
SOMETIMES I THINK
SHE'S THE ONLY THING
I EVER GOT RIGHT.

29:24.160 --> 29:25.752
I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE.

29:27.160 --> 29:29.253
MY WIFE AND I ARE
TRYING FOR ANOTHER ONE.

29:29.360 --> 29:31.521
YEAH, RUTH TOLD ME.

29:31.630 --> 29:34.292
- SORRY ABOUT...
- YEAH YEAH, THANKS.

29:37.040 --> 29:39.838
SO, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
ARE YOU MARRIED?
YOU SINGLE?

29:39.940 --> 29:43.307
OH, I BROKE UP WITH SOMEONE
RIGHT BEFORE I MOVED UP HERE
FROM PHOENIX.

29:43.410 --> 29:45.549
I'M SORRY.

29:45.650 --> 29:47.447
NO, IT'S GOOD.

29:47.550 --> 29:49.518
I WAS MARRIED FOR A WHILE,

29:49.620 --> 29:51.247
A LONG TIME AGO.

29:52.590 --> 29:54.182
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I WORK A LOT

29:54.290 --> 29:57.487
SO IT'S EASIER FOR ME
TO BE ON MY OWN FOR NOW.

29:57.590 --> 29:59.785
ANY DESIRE FOR KIDS?

30:03.730 --> 30:06.096
I'M SORRY.
IS THAT TOO PERSONAL?

30:06.200 --> 30:07.519
NO.

30:08.340 --> 30:10.729
MY HUSBAND, UM...

30:10.840 --> 30:13.229
OUR SON HAD A.L.L.

30:13.340 --> 30:17.436
_ 1--
- THAT'S ACUTE
LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA.

30:17.540 --> 30:20.873
SO, HE DIDN'T MAKE IT.

30:20.980 --> 30:23.369
OH, MAGGIE, I'M--

30:23.480 --> 30:25.846
JESUS, I'M SO SORRY.

30:27.990 --> 30:30.686
I HAD NO IDEA.
I JUST, UM...

30:30.790 --> 30:32.724
I CAN'T IMAGINE.

30:32.830 --> 30:34.695
SHIT! JESUS.

30:34.800 --> 30:36.392
YEAH.

30:37.730 --> 30:39.322
WHEN?

30:39.430 --> 30:41.239
OH, HE WAS TWO,

30:41.340 --> 30:45.606
SO IT WAS, GOD,
SIX YEARS AGO.

30:50.840 --> 30:53.104
YEAH, TIME DOESN'T HELP,
DOES IT?

30:54.880 --> 30:57.144
NOPE.

31:02.820 --> 31:06.586
- MY FIRST WIFE...
- I HEARD.

31:06.690 --> 31:08.521
SO YOU KNOW HOW
IT GOES.

31:10.300 --> 31:12.860
YEAH.

31:12.970 --> 31:15.268
BUT TWO YEARS-OLD.
WOW.

31:19.340 --> 31:21.570
( sighs )

31:26.980 --> 31:29.346
- HOW CAN THEY DO THIS TO YOU?
- Claire: I KNOW!

31:29.450 --> 31:32.317
IT'S NOT LIKE
I'M WASTING THE MONEY.
I'M LIVING ON IT!

31:32.420 --> 31:34.559
IT'S YOUR MONEY.
THAT'S THE FUCKING POINT!

31:34.660 --> 31:36.013
APPARENTLY NOT
UNTIL I'M 25!

31:36.120 --> 31:37.951
OH, THAT'S BULLSHIT!
THAT'S BULLSHIT!

31:38.060 --> 31:40.028
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN 21 AND 25?

31:40.130 --> 31:41.529
THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE!

31:41.630 --> 31:44.064
LOOK, IF YOU COULD PAY
FOR US TO GET TO BARCELONA,

31:44.170 --> 31:46.730
ONCE WE'RE THERE I CAN
GET A WORK VISA

31:46.830 --> 31:48.388
AND TRANSLATE
OR SOMETHING.

31:48.500 --> 31:50.365
I MEAN I TOOK SPANISH.
I LEARN FAST.

31:50.470 --> 31:53.803
BABY, I'LL PAY
FOR EVERYTHING FOREVER.
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE MONEY.

31:53.910 --> 31:56.936
I CARE THAT YOUR
FAMILY TREATS YOU LIKE
A CRIPPLED CHILD.

31:57.040 --> 31:59.747
EITHER THAT
OR THEY IGNORE ME.

31:59.850 --> 32:01.977
THEY ALWAYS HAVE!

32:02.080 --> 32:04.412
THERE'S NO REASON
TO EVEN TALK ABOUT
THIS ANYMORE.

32:04.520 --> 32:07.284
- THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.
- YOU CAN CONFRONT YOUR MOTHER.

32:07.390 --> 32:09.779
SHE WON'T LISTEN!

32:09.890 --> 32:11.482
I'M ON HER FUCKING HIT LIST!

32:11.590 --> 32:14.559
- YOU DON'T DESERVE THIS.
- MY FATHER WOULD BE
SO PISSED!

32:20.800 --> 32:22.836
THERE'S A LOT OF CANDY.

32:22.940 --> 32:24.828
BUT IN THE MACHINE
IT SOMETIMES GETS STALE.

32:24.940 --> 32:27.238
I MORE OF A SALT
AND GREASE PERSON.

32:27.340 --> 32:30.605
- FRITOS?
- YEAH, FRITOS.

32:30.710 --> 32:33.406
HOW ABOUT
SOME OF THOSE LITTLE
ORANGE CRACKERS?

32:33.510 --> 32:35.046
YEAH, THEY'RE GOOD.

32:35.150 --> 32:37.015
WHAT'S IN THEM ANYWAY?

32:37.120 --> 32:39.042
I THINK I HAVE
SOME MORE QUARTERS.

32:39.150 --> 32:41.050
OH, LOOK,
THEY'VE GOT FUNIONS!

32:41.160 --> 32:42.912
( coins jingle)

32:43.020 --> 32:45.727
I'M SORRY.

32:48.460 --> 32:52.191
I OVERREACT ED.
I JUST FELT SO GUILTY.

32:52.300 --> 32:54.359
- I HAD TO--
- BECOME A FUCKING LUNATIC?

32:54.470 --> 32:57.394
WHO ATTACKS THE ONE PERSON
WHO LOVES YOU MORE
THAN ANYBODY?

33:02.040 --> 33:03.905
YEAH.

33:04.010 --> 33:05.546
SORRY.

33:10.280 --> 33:13.113
WHY DO YOU ACT LIKE
WE'RE ON DIFFERENT SIDES?

33:14.860 --> 33:17.112
BECAUSE I'M AN IDIOT.

33:23.130 --> 33:25.394
IT'S NOT A COMPETITION.

33:26.600 --> 33:29.535
NO MATTER HOW WE GET
A CHILD WE BOTH WIN.

33:34.010 --> 33:36.706
THEN WE'LL GO
TO THE SURROGATE TOGETHER.

33:39.880 --> 33:42.110
YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU APOLOGIZE...

33:46.090 --> 33:49.014
YOU'RE ONE SEXY
MOTHERFUCKER.

33:49.120 --> 33:51.452
I'M SORRY.

33:51.560 --> 33:53.323
( laughs )

33:53.430 --> 33:56.627
I'M SORRY.

33:56.730 --> 34:01.064
I'M SORRY
I'M SUCH A NAUGHTY
NAUGHTY NAUGHTY BOY.

34:01.170 --> 34:02.535
( laughs )

34:02.640 --> 34:05.200
( moans )
OH, YEAH.
GOD, YES!

34:07.240 --> 34:10.004
LET'S DO IT
ANOTHER WAY.

34:10.110 --> 34:12.408
ANYWAY YOU WANT.

34:14.080 --> 34:16.344
- ( growls )
- WHOO.

34:16.450 --> 34:17.474
( laughs )

34:17.580 --> 34:19.548
( shrieks )

34:19.650 --> 34:21.049
( shouts )
OH MY GOD!

34:21.160 --> 34:25.051
YOU'RE THE CUTEST
GODDAMNED LITTLE FUCKER!

34:25.160 --> 34:27.685
( moans )

34:27.790 --> 34:29.655
DID YOU ENJOY YOURSELF
TONIGHT?

34:29.760 --> 34:31.694
I CERTAINLY DID.

34:31.800 --> 34:33.620
I DID TOO.

34:33.730 --> 34:36.290
- IT WAS PLEASANT.
- HMM.

34:36.400 --> 34:38.539
IT'S SUCH A RELIEF
TO SEE YOU SMILE.

34:38.640 --> 34:42.428
OH, HOW I HATE TO SEE
THOSE STORM CLOUDS GATHER.

34:42.540 --> 34:44.599
IT'S VERY SCARY.

34:44.710 --> 34:47.838
"HURRICANE RUTH."

34:47.950 --> 34:50.578
I TRY TO SMILE OFTEN.

34:50.680 --> 34:54.150
IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU
CAN DO ON COMMAND.

34:57.060 --> 34:59.449
( sighs )
PLEASE DON'T KNIT.

34:59.560 --> 35:01.118
I ENJOY KNITTING.

35:01.230 --> 35:04.688
I DESERVE TO KNIT.

35:04.800 --> 35:08.190
YOU PUT THOSE THINGS UP,
YOU'RE A MILLION MILES AWAY.

35:08.300 --> 35:11.758
I'M SIX INCHES
TO YOUR RIGHT.

35:12.870 --> 35:15.407
18 INCHES.

35:17.540 --> 35:20.338
WE DON'T HAVE TO BE ATTACHED
AT THE HIP.

35:20.450 --> 35:23.578
YOU'RE A GROWN MAN
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE.

35:30.220 --> 35:33.758
YOU KNOW, I WANT A STRONG,
CLOSE FAMILY TOO, RUTH.

35:36.160 --> 35:38.367
WE CAN STILL DO IT.

35:38.470 --> 35:39.823
CAN'T WE?

35:41.270 --> 35:43.568
IF YOU WOULD GIVE ME
A MOMENT'S PEACE.

35:48.910 --> 35:50.332
OKAY.

35:56.850 --> 35:58.181
OKAY.

36:06.560 --> 36:07.822
( sighs )

36:30.150 --> 36:31.742
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

36:31.850 --> 36:33.738
BREAKFAST IN BED.

36:39.990 --> 36:42.493
MM. GOOD.

36:42.600 --> 36:44.056
( chuckles )

36:44.160 --> 36:47.197
THIS WAY
WE'LL BOTH BE FARTING!

36:47.300 --> 36:48.892
( laughs )

36:49.000 --> 36:51.867
HEY, WILL YOU DO
SOMETHING FOR ME?

36:51.970 --> 36:53.562
SHOOT.

36:53.670 --> 36:55.103
COME HOME
FOR DINNER TONIGHT.

36:55.210 --> 36:57.371
WELL, I WILL IF I CAN.

36:57.480 --> 36:59.209
SAY THAT YOU WILL.

36:59.310 --> 37:01.710
- WHY?
- I'M GONNA COOK.

37:01.820 --> 37:03.344
OKAY, BUT IF I'M LATE

37:03.450 --> 37:05.589
JUST GRAB SOMETHING WITH MAYA.
I'LL GET SOMETHING AT MOM'S.

37:05.690 --> 37:07.419
THAT'S OKAY.
WE'LL WAIT FOR YOU.

37:07.520 --> 37:11.217
WHAT'S UP?
IS THIS SOME BIG OCCASION
I FORGOT ABOUT?

37:11.330 --> 37:14.788
NO, I'D JUST LIKE US ALL
TO HAVE DINNER TOGETHER.

37:14.900 --> 37:17.357
WELL, I'LL DO MY BEST.

37:17.460 --> 37:19.394
I APPRECIATE IT.

38:19.290 --> 38:21.224
Young George's voice:
MOM!

38:21.330 --> 38:22.627
MOM!

38:22.730 --> 38:25.460
WAKE UP!
WAKE UP RIGHT NOW!

38:25.570 --> 38:27.424
MOM!

38:28.340 --> 38:29.898
Ruth's voice:
GEORGE?

38:30.000 --> 38:32.730
- GEORGE?
- WHAT?

38:32.840 --> 38:35.968
I GAVE YOU THIS SANDWICH
FOUR DAYS AGO.

38:36.080 --> 38:40.005
WE HAD BAKED POTATOES
AND BROCCOLI NIGHT BEFORE LAST.

38:40.110 --> 38:41.975
WHY ARE THEY IN YOUR POCKETS?

38:42.080 --> 38:44.389
I WASN'T HUNGRY.

38:44.490 --> 38:46.583
I DIDN'T WANT TO HURT
YOUR FEELINGS.

38:46.690 --> 38:49.386
SO YOU HID THE FOOD
IN YOUR CLOTHES?

38:50.360 --> 38:52.988
I WAS SAVING IT
FOR LATER.

38:56.160 --> 38:58.526
- I'M SORRY.
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

38:58.630 --> 39:02.999
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU
TO WEAR ROTTING FOOD.

39:03.100 --> 39:05.762
- DO I NEED TO CHECK
THE CLOSET?
- NO NO.

39:05.870 --> 39:07.701
UM, I'LL DO IT.

39:07.810 --> 39:09.778
OKAY THEN.

39:11.880 --> 39:14.075
I'M VERY SORRY.

39:14.180 --> 39:16.068
IT'S NOTHING, DEAR.

39:26.360 --> 39:28.555
( disposal whirring )

39:30.900 --> 39:33.869
Angela:
I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT YOU
STILL TALK TO EACH OTHER.

39:33.970 --> 39:37.531
I MEAN, I GUESS WITH KIDS
YOU HAVE TO.

39:37.640 --> 39:40.108
Rico:
WHAT HAPPENED
WITH YOUR DIVORCE?

39:40.210 --> 39:43.338
I DON'T KNOW.

39:43.440 --> 39:46.603
IT WAS LIKE THE RELATIONSHIP
GOT CANCER--

39:47.780 --> 39:49.475
THE FAST KIND
WHERE NOTHING HELPS.

39:49.580 --> 39:52.811
AND NOW WE'RE BOTH DEAD
TO EACH OTHER.

39:54.520 --> 39:56.715
I KIND OF FORGOT
WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE.

39:58.460 --> 40:00.724
- THAT'S SO SAD.
- ( chuckles )

40:00.830 --> 40:03.424
EH.

40:03.530 --> 40:08.399
YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANTED
TO KEEP THIS GOING WE CAN.

40:10.140 --> 40:13.564
ACTUALLY, I HAVE
A BOYFRIEND.

40:13.670 --> 40:16.878
HE'S NOT, LIKE, GREAT
OR ANYTHING.

40:16.980 --> 40:20.199
BUT, UM, I DON'T KNOW
IF I'M READY TO DUMP HIM YET.

40:20.310 --> 40:22.972
ANYWAY, YOU'RE STILL
A MARRIED MAN.

40:23.080 --> 40:25.742
OH...

40:25.850 --> 40:27.010
RIGHT.

40:27.120 --> 40:28.382
( chuckles )

40:28.490 --> 40:32.221
WELL, I REALLY HOPE
YOU FIND SOMEONE SPECIAL.

40:32.330 --> 40:35.026
RICO!

40:35.130 --> 40:37.451
I'M HERE AT THE IRVINE
CENTER QUALITY INN.

40:37.560 --> 40:40.893
AND I JUST HAD MY BRAINS
SCREWED LOOSE

40:41.000 --> 40:43.889
BY A GUY WHO CAN MAKE
A MUTILATED CORPSE

40:44.000 --> 40:46.662
LOOK LIKE
A FUCKING MOVIE STAR.

40:48.210 --> 40:49.472
ANGELA.

40:49.580 --> 40:52.504
( both laugh )

40:52.610 --> 40:55.511
SO DON'T YOU BE FEELING
SORRY FOR ME.

40:56.380 --> 40:58.917
OKAY?

40:59.020 --> 41:01.989
I KNOW IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
I HAVE CHILD-BEARING HIPS.

41:02.090 --> 41:03.409
( laughs )

41:03.520 --> 41:05.556
REALLY HADN'T THOUGHT
ABOUT THAT.

41:05.660 --> 41:07.423
I'M SURE
YOUR HIPS ARE FINE.

41:07.530 --> 41:11.057
HAVING BABIES IS SOMETHING
I DO VERY VERY WELL.

41:11.160 --> 41:12.764
I'M INCREDIBLY FERTILE.

41:12.870 --> 41:16.761
I NEVER GET SICK.
MY LAST LABOR WAS
THREE HOURS.

41:16.870 --> 41:19.907
OTHER WOMEN HAVE
CONTRACT IONS FOR DAYS.
I GUESS I'M LUCKY.

41:20.010 --> 41:22.570
AND HOW MANY CHILDREN
HAVE YOU HAD?

41:22.680 --> 41:25.706
ONE ON MY OWN,
AND ONE FOR A COUPLE
IN NEW MEXICO.

41:25.810 --> 41:27.903
BEAUTIFUL, HEALTHY GIRLS.

41:28.010 --> 41:30.444
DEBORAH IN THE OFFICE
HAS PICTURES.

41:30.550 --> 41:34.509
WHY DID YOU DECIDE
TO BECOME A SURROGATE?

41:34.620 --> 41:37.054
IT'S NOT THE MONEY
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

41:37.160 --> 41:40.254
MY HUSBAND MAKES
AN EXCELLENT LIVING
IN COMPUTERS.

41:40.360 --> 41:42.419
NO, IT'S JUST,
YOU KNOW,

41:42.530 --> 41:45.067
CARRYING A CHILD
FOR SOMEONE ELSE,

41:45.170 --> 41:46.489
THAT CAN'T BE EASY.

41:46.600 --> 41:48.261
LET ME TELL YOU A SECRET--

41:48.370 --> 41:52.261
A PREGNANT WOMEN IS
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
IN THE WORLD.

41:52.370 --> 41:54.907
EVERYBODY TALKS TO HER.

41:55.010 --> 41:56.898
EVERYBODY WANTS
TO TOUCH HER.

41:57.010 --> 42:00.104
IT'S LIKE
HAVING A MAGICAL POWER

42:00.210 --> 42:02.314
TO MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY.

42:02.420 --> 42:04.445
THE BABY IN NEW MEXICO,

42:04.550 --> 42:06.814
HOW COULD YOU GIVE HER AWAY?

42:06.920 --> 42:09.457
THAT'S WHAT'S HARD
FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND.

42:09.560 --> 42:12.279
( whispers )
DAVID, IT'S A MIND-SET.

42:12.390 --> 42:14.221
SHE NEVER BELONGED TO ME.

42:14.330 --> 42:16.798
HMM.

42:16.900 --> 42:19.619
AND YOU HAVE NO PROBLEM

42:19.730 --> 42:22.460
WITH THE PARENTS BEING
TWO GAY MEN?

42:22.570 --> 42:24.765
I LOVE GAY MEN!

42:24.870 --> 42:27.134
WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE
GAY MEN WERE MY BEST FRIENDS!

42:27.240 --> 42:30.437
THEY CERTAINLY
TREATED ME BETTER
THAN MY BOYFRIENDS.

42:30.540 --> 42:33.509
( laughs )
I'M EXAGGERATING.

42:33.610 --> 42:36.579
YOU TWO SEEM
SO GOOD TOGETHER.

42:36.680 --> 42:40.844
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE
A BABY FOR YOU.

42:45.460 --> 42:48.258
JESUS CHRIST, MOM,
WOULD YOU STOP CLEANING
AND TALK TO ME?

42:48.360 --> 42:50.749
NO, THIS ISN'T THE TIME
AND THERE'S NOTHING
TO SAY.

42:50.860 --> 42:52.464
DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S SIGNIFICANT

42:52.570 --> 42:55.733
THAT WHENEVER I MAKE
A DECISION FOR MYSELF
YOU HATE ME?

42:55.840 --> 42:58.400
I DON'T HATE YOU.
I HATE YOUR CHOICES.

42:58.500 --> 43:00.138
LOOK AT ME!

43:01.840 --> 43:03.603
( sighs )
I AM AN ADULT!

43:03.710 --> 43:05.541
AND MY CHOICES ARE
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS!

43:05.650 --> 43:07.845
YOU HAD NO RIGHT
TO CALL THAT LAWYER.

43:07.950 --> 43:10.475
DAD LOVED ME.
HE WANTED ME TO BE HAPPY.

43:10.580 --> 43:12.286
THAT'S WHY HE LEI-T ME
THE MONEY.

43:12.390 --> 43:15.689
HE DID NOT INTEND TO FINANCE
YOU WHILE YOU PLAY HOUSE
WITH A CRAZY PERSON!

43:15.790 --> 43:18.384
( scoffs )
LOOK WHO'S TALKING.

43:18.490 --> 43:20.458
HE WANTED YOU
TO BE EDUCATED,

43:20.560 --> 43:23.791
- TO LEARN, TO GO TO COLLEGE!
- I AM LEARNING FROM LIFE!

43:23.900 --> 43:26.289
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT COLLEGE IS!
YOU NEVER WENT.

43:26.400 --> 43:28.960
THAT WAS YOUR CHOICE
AND NOW YOU HATE
YOURSELF FOR IT

43:29.070 --> 43:31.334
- SO YOU'RE GONNA
TAKE IT OUT ON ME!
- THAT IS NOT TRUE!

43:31.440 --> 43:33.965
THEN STOP BEING
A CONTROLLING BITCH
AND GIVE ME MY MONEY!

43:34.070 --> 43:36.300
I WILL HIT YOU BACK
THIS TIME!

43:38.850 --> 43:40.738
BILLY AND I ARE MOVING
TO SPAIN.

43:40.850 --> 43:42.715
AND YOU CAN'T STOP US.

43:42.820 --> 43:45.084
GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!

43:58.430 --> 44:00.364
HOW DOES IT TASTE?

44:00.470 --> 44:02.062
IT'S GOOD.

44:02.170 --> 44:05.833
- WE'VE HAD IT BEFORE, RIGHT?
- NO, THIS IS NEW.

44:05.940 --> 44:08.306
CHICKEN
AND VEGETABLE SAUTE...

44:08.410 --> 44:12.244
- MMM.
- ...OVER HERBED
POLENTA TRIANGLES.

44:12.350 --> 44:14.648
IT'S GOOD.

44:21.350 --> 44:24.683
YOU KNOW THEY STARTED
PULLING THAT GREAT HOUSE
DOWN ON THE CORNER.

44:24.790 --> 44:26.849
WHICH ONE?
THAT BIG CRAI-TSMEN?

44:26.960 --> 44:29.190
- HMM.
- THAT'S A DRAG.
IT'S A COOL HOUSE.

44:29.300 --> 44:31.655
YEAH.

44:34.800 --> 44:36.995
WE SHOULD DO THIS
MORE OI-TEN.

44:37.100 --> 44:38.738
YEAH.

44:38.840 --> 44:41.035
YOU KNOW, I JUST WANT
TO HAVE DINNER LIKE A FAMILY.

44:41.140 --> 44:44.268
- LIKE A REAL FAMILY.
- (fork cllnks)

44:44.380 --> 44:47.201
QUIT TRYING TO BE
SOME FUCKING HAUSFRAU!
YOU'RE A REBEL!

44:47.310 --> 44:49.778
YOU'RE A FREAK!
WE'RE NEVER GOING TO BE
A REAL FAMILY

44:49.880 --> 44:52.144
NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAUTE!

44:54.490 --> 44:56.754
WELL, WE ARE
A REAL FAMILY.

44:56.860 --> 45:00.023
OH, YEAH, I KNOW.
THAT DIDN'T COME OUT RIGHT.

45:00.130 --> 45:02.849
I JUST MEANT, YOU KNOW,
I'D LIKE US TO HAVE MORE FUN.

45:04.400 --> 45:06.960
YOU KNOW, REALLY CONNECT.

45:07.070 --> 45:09.959
WELL, WE ARE CONNECTING.

45:10.070 --> 45:12.959
- ( giggles )
- I'M HAVING FUN.
YOU'RE HAVING FUN, RIGHT?

45:13.070 --> 45:16.107
- UH-HUH.
- YEAH, WE'RE ENJOYING
OURSELVES.

45:21.750 --> 45:23.809
Claire:
OH MY GOD!

45:23.920 --> 45:27.048
THIS SO MUCH BETTER
THAN THE ONE I WAS
GONNA GET.

45:27.150 --> 45:29.380
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO DO THIS.

45:29.490 --> 45:31.515
Billy:
YES, I DID!

45:31.620 --> 45:32.985
OH, THIS IS SO COOL.

45:33.090 --> 45:35.991
I CAN USE ALL MY LENSES
FROM MY 35 WITH THIS.

45:36.100 --> 45:38.660
THIS IS FOR BOTH OF US.
WE'RE GONNA SHARE.

45:38.770 --> 45:41.659
NO NO!
I GOT ONE FOR MYSELF, TOO.

45:41.770 --> 45:43.897
YOU WHAT?

45:44.000 --> 45:45.638
( Billy laughs )

45:45.740 --> 45:48.038
WHAT IS ALL THIS SHIT?

45:48.140 --> 45:50.677
WHAT, DID YOU GO
TO BEVERLY HILLS

45:50.780 --> 45:52.338
AND HAVE, LIKE,
A SHOPPING SEIZURE?

45:52.450 --> 45:54.145
( Billy laughs )

45:54.250 --> 45:56.946
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
WITH THIS ANTIQUE MICROSCOPE?

45:57.050 --> 45:59.086
OH, WE'LL LOOK THROUGH IT
AND GET IDEAS!

45:59.190 --> 46:01.340
WAIT WAIT.
THESE ARE THE BEST!
CLOSE YOUR EYES!

46:01.450 --> 46:03.987
- ARE THEY CLOSED?
- YEAH.

46:04.090 --> 46:05.626
HUH?

46:05.730 --> 46:07.857
YOU BOUGHT LEATHER PANTS?

46:07.960 --> 46:10.656
YOU ARE SUCH
A FUCKING ROCK STAR!

46:10.760 --> 46:13.024
KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

46:13.900 --> 46:15.492
* AI YAI YAI YAI

46:15.600 --> 46:16.999
* AI YAI YAI YAI

46:17.100 --> 46:19.261
* TALKIN' 'BOUT
THE BIG MONKEY MAN *

46:19.370 --> 46:23.101
* I NEVER SAW YOU,
I ONLY HEARD OF YOU *

46:23.210 --> 46:25.678
* TALKIN' 'BOUT
THE BIG MONKEY MAN *

46:25.780 --> 46:27.998
* I NEVER SAW YOU.

46:28.110 --> 46:30.613
Woman's voice:
I'll leave you
with Grandpa,

46:30.720 --> 46:32.210
Daddy and Caroline.

46:32.320 --> 46:35.756
And knowing that,
I can finally say goodbye.

46:35.860 --> 46:37.885
( orchestral music playing )

46:37.990 --> 46:40.049
AH, THAT WAS LOVELY.

46:40.860 --> 46:43.226
A LITTLE TOO SAD FOR ME.

46:43.960 --> 46:46.292
BUT VERY TRUE TO LIFE.

46:51.400 --> 46:55.131
NOW, I'M GONNA TAKE
A BATH SO YOU TWO HAVE
SOME TIME ALONE.

46:55.240 --> 46:56.798
OH, RUTH, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT.

46:56.910 --> 46:58.707
THAT'S OKAY.

46:58.810 --> 47:00.949
DOES EVERYONE HAVE
EVERYTHING THEY NEED?

47:02.020 --> 47:03.817
YES, DEAR.
THANK YOU.

47:03.920 --> 47:05.785
GOODBYE.

47:05.890 --> 47:08.279
I MEAN, GOOD NIGHT.

47:23.370 --> 47:25.031
DADDY, WHAT'S WRONG?

47:28.310 --> 47:30.198
- I'M GONNA GET RUTH.
- NO.

47:30.310 --> 47:32.198
DON'T.

47:32.310 --> 47:34.244
PLEASE.

47:36.620 --> 47:38.178
YOU'VE GOT TO HELP
ME, MAGGIE.

47:41.450 --> 47:43.179
I'M HAVING MORE SYMPTOMS.

47:43.290 --> 47:47.351
I NEED ANOTHER SHOCK TREATMENT
BEFORE IT GETS WORSE.

47:47.460 --> 47:49.792
OH, DADDY.

47:49.900 --> 47:52.824
BUT YOU MUSTN'T
TELL HER, OKAY?

47:52.930 --> 47:54.488
I HAVE TO.

47:54.600 --> 47:57.034
- ( sighs )
- SHE'S YOUR WIFE.
SHE WANTS TO KNOW.

47:57.140 --> 47:58.289
NO.

47:58.400 --> 48:00.630
NO, SHE DOESN'T.

48:00.740 --> 48:02.230
BELIEVE ME.
( sniffs )

48:02.340 --> 48:05.707
CAN YOU JUST MAKE
THE APPOINTMENT,

48:05.810 --> 48:08.074
TAKE ME TO THE DOCTOR
AND BRING ME HOME?

48:08.180 --> 48:11.069
I DON'T FEEL RIGHT ABOUT
NOT TELLING RUTH.

48:12.620 --> 48:14.542
I LOVE HER, MAGGIE.

48:17.090 --> 48:19.558
IF I LOSE HER
I'M FINISHED.
