00:53.053 --> 00:56.723
THE SUMMER WE LIVED

02:31.851 --> 02:35.722
GALICIA, AUGUST 1998

02:37.223 --> 02:39.826
The story I'm going to tell you isn't the story of my life.

02:40.293 --> 02:41.361
I wish it were.

02:42.395 --> 02:46.366
This I'm going to tell is a love story that began in 1958...

02:46.966 --> 02:49.502
and lasted for nearly forty years.

02:50.737 --> 02:52.138
An eternal love story

02:53.039 --> 02:55.808
that happened during the summer of 1958.

03:03.883 --> 03:04.918
Hello.

03:08.521 --> 03:09.489
Hello!

03:26.673 --> 03:29.209
-Are you interested in teleprinters? -Sorry?

03:29.275 --> 03:30.877
-Cigarette? -I don't smoke.

03:30.944 --> 03:34.614
Good, me either. I haven't tried it in three years. My wife forbade me.

03:34.714 --> 03:36.783
-And who are you? -Isabel Guirao.

03:36.883 --> 03:39.786
-I'm here for the internship. -Oh, the internship. Yes, this way.

03:41.721 --> 03:44.591
I was told it started today and that someone would pick me up at the station,

03:44.691 --> 03:46.226
but no one showed up. I had to walk here.

03:46.292 --> 03:48.294
You arrived at lunch time.

03:48.394 --> 03:51.231
Besides, this isn't so big. You can't miss it.

03:53.900 --> 03:56.302
So, why Cantaloa?

03:56.402 --> 03:59.973
Last one to choose the internship. Need it to finish the degree.

04:00.073 --> 04:03.376
Well, you're not Gloria Steinem and this isn't The New York Times.

04:03.443 --> 04:04.777
ARCHIVE

04:10.750 --> 04:13.286
-You want me to organize the archive. -You'll work here.

04:13.386 --> 04:16.122
You'll take care of our main source of income.

04:16.222 --> 04:18.791
Advertisements? Look, sir, maybe I wasn't clear enough.

04:18.891 --> 04:22.061
At the end of the internship I have to prove I wrote reports,

04:22.128 --> 04:24.264
chronicles, articles..., that I wrote stuff, understand?

04:24.330 --> 04:26.733
And that's what you'll do, take care of the obituary section.

04:27.433 --> 04:28.668
The obituaries?

04:29.602 --> 04:31.471
The families take care of that.

04:31.571 --> 04:34.774
In most cases, but sometimes they don't know what to say.

04:35.408 --> 04:38.645
It's a great responsibility, a good opportunity;

04:38.745 --> 04:40.446
if someone dies, anyway.

04:40.513 --> 04:43.850
And who knows? You might even be lucky enough to write mine.

04:52.825 --> 04:54.794
-You're Isabel, right? -Yes.

04:55.928 --> 04:58.031
-Nice to meet you, I'm Laura. -A pleasure, Laura.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.500
How's your first day?

05:01.301 --> 05:03.002
I can't complain, no one died.

05:03.369 --> 05:04.304
Yet.

05:05.438 --> 05:08.441
This came in the mail. It's an obituary.

05:08.508 --> 05:09.542
I haven't opened it, eh?

05:10.310 --> 05:13.379
I'll take care of it when I'm done.

05:13.479 --> 05:15.381
If you need help, let me know.

05:15.481 --> 05:16.783
Don't overdo it.

05:16.849 --> 05:19.352
The new interns are pranked into this every year.

06:04.697 --> 06:05.832
"Dear Lucía,

06:05.898 --> 06:09.268
nearly 40 years have gone by since our lives crossed paths

06:09.369 --> 06:11.270
and you still keep showing up in my dreams

06:11.371 --> 06:13.573
reminding me that another life is possible,

06:13.673 --> 06:15.041
a happier one, with you."

06:15.375 --> 06:17.910
"I'm still stuck in that summer of 1958,

06:18.010 --> 06:20.279
the same one in which we met and I lost you.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.281
How could I ever forget what was meant to last forever?"

06:22.382 --> 06:26.018
"It won't be long before we meet". All those obituaries are the same.

06:26.085 --> 06:27.220
What do you mean all?

06:27.286 --> 06:30.623
He's been sending them for ten years. Always on September 15th.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.792
-And always for some Lucía. -Ten years.

06:33.359 --> 06:36.963
-And we don't know who it is? -No, no return address on the post.

06:37.063 --> 06:40.533
It's interesting, he has never sent it so many weeks in advance.

06:40.600 --> 06:44.537
It's August. Schedule it for next month and that's that.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.643
Do you keep the others?

06:59.485 --> 07:03.322
"Dear Lucía, it was the first time I set foot on sunny land.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.892
All those people working in the fields. I could feel their heat.

07:05.958 --> 07:07.794
I can still smell that smell.

07:07.894 --> 07:09.962
I need to see that dust getting my shoes dirty.

07:10.062 --> 07:12.632
I'm still stuck in that summer of 1958.

07:12.732 --> 07:15.334
We were like a big family, the Vega-Ibáñez family.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.804
And you appeared... united... dear Lucía.

07:17.904 --> 07:20.640
Nearly forty years have gone by since our lives crossed paths

07:20.740 --> 07:23.943
and you keep showing up in my dreams. Our picture said so many things,

07:24.010 --> 07:26.813
reminding me that life is possible. To hear your laugh again,

07:26.913 --> 07:29.248
one more time, joyful, with you, in the middle of the road.

07:29.315 --> 07:31.417
How could I forget the summer we lived...

07:32.251 --> 07:36.155
THE SUMMER WE LIVED

08:29.842 --> 08:31.344
What happened?

08:34.847 --> 08:37.383
You're bleeding... Your eyebrow's bleeding.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.353
Here. Here.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.422
-Thank you. -Are you ok?

08:43.523 --> 08:44.557
-Yes. -Are you sure?

08:44.657 --> 08:46.225
I think so.

08:55.768 --> 08:57.937
You chopped off the vine.

08:59.338 --> 09:00.773
It's completely chopped.

09:03.242 --> 09:05.511
What were you thinking driving around here in that car?

09:05.912 --> 09:07.880
Well, it's the only car I have.

09:12.518 --> 09:14.353
My father will be upset.

09:16.022 --> 09:16.856
I'm sorry.

09:17.456 --> 09:19.892
I'm looking for the Ibañez family country house.

09:19.959 --> 09:21.928
They told me to ask for someone called "Menato".

09:24.597 --> 09:25.531
Meinato.

09:26.799 --> 09:28.601
El Meinato Vineyard.

09:29.135 --> 09:30.536
Do you know it then?

09:32.638 --> 09:33.573
Yes.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.318
-You want me to give you a lift. -Thank you.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.076
Are you coming or what?

10:24.090 --> 10:25.625
What are you doing around here?

10:26.692 --> 10:28.928
I'm designing Hernán Ibáñez's new wine cellar.

10:29.362 --> 10:30.329
Do you know him?

10:31.530 --> 10:33.466
-You're an architect? -Yes.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.603
-Is something wrong? -Not at all.

11:47.873 --> 11:50.443
You'll have to get used to having dust on your shoes.

12:07.026 --> 12:07.927
Thank you.

12:08.694 --> 12:10.463
No, keep it. It's a gift.

12:12.698 --> 12:13.733
Here he is.

12:31.917 --> 12:33.119
Give me a hand.

12:42.128 --> 12:45.064
Gonzalo, what are you doing here? I wasn't expecting you until tomorrow.

12:46.732 --> 12:49.301
Right. I made the trip earlier.

12:50.436 --> 12:52.605
I can come back later if this is a bad time.

12:52.671 --> 12:55.441
Don't worry, they're just some English clients.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.610
I'll send instructions right away for them to be served wine and ham.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.480
What happened to you?

13:02.615 --> 13:03.582
Nothing.

13:04.950 --> 13:08.320
I didn't listen to you, I drove here. I think I destroyed my car.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.123
-But you're ok? -Yes.

13:11.190 --> 13:14.994
If it weren't for that girl, I'd still be stranded at the vineyard.

13:19.532 --> 13:22.635
And I chopped off a vine. I think I've moved all the dirt.

13:24.136 --> 13:25.171
What's wrong?

13:26.539 --> 13:27.973
I'm happy to see you, Gonzalo.

13:29.475 --> 13:30.810
Aren't you going to give me a hug?

13:32.711 --> 13:33.646
No.

13:37.716 --> 13:39.518
C'mon, come here.

13:49.128 --> 13:51.530
Forget everything you thought you knew about wine.

13:51.630 --> 13:54.366
This isn't like the north, Jerez is something else.

13:57.203 --> 13:58.671
This type is called palomino,

13:59.805 --> 14:02.041
it's the gold that sustains all of Jerez.

14:02.141 --> 14:04.910
This grape only grows here. Do you know why?

14:11.517 --> 14:15.421
Albariza. A land sponged by water and caressed by the wind.

14:17.223 --> 14:18.324
Can you smell it?

14:21.427 --> 14:22.428
No.

14:24.029 --> 14:25.331
Close your eyes.

14:27.666 --> 14:29.335
C'mon, close your eyes.

14:34.506 --> 14:36.008
Let the nose get used to it.

14:44.583 --> 14:47.686
That which you can't see or smell is the Atlantic's breeze.

14:47.753 --> 14:49.088
You'll understand soon.

15:03.969 --> 15:05.237
See that border?

15:08.474 --> 15:12.044
It separates my family's land from my future wife's.

15:12.111 --> 15:14.747
-We're going to merge the winery. -I see.

15:19.118 --> 15:20.552
I'm getting married, Gonzalo.

15:21.987 --> 15:23.055
I don't believe you.

15:28.427 --> 15:31.830
-I'm finally going to settle down. -Why haven't you told me sooner?

15:33.966 --> 15:36.602
The things that are only said once in a lifetime aren't sent in a letter,

15:36.669 --> 15:38.103
they're said in person.

15:42.408 --> 15:44.176
The new winery

15:44.276 --> 15:47.646
it's the bonding of our families, the Vega-Ibáñez firm.

15:49.081 --> 15:52.017
It would mean a lot to me if it was done by then.

16:04.296 --> 16:05.331
Congratulations.

16:13.839 --> 16:15.975
Lucía, come here a moment.

16:18.510 --> 16:21.013
This is Lucía Vega, my fiancée.

16:24.116 --> 16:25.784
Nice to meet you, Gonzalo.

16:28.487 --> 16:29.855
So you knew, didn't you?

16:29.955 --> 16:32.624
He wanted to surprise you and I couldn't tell.

16:34.226 --> 16:36.495
Forgive me. Please, forgive me.

16:38.297 --> 16:39.465
You're terrible.

16:53.912 --> 16:56.915
The new wine cellar has to be ready for the harvest festival.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.917
-When's that? -September 15th.

16:59.251 --> 17:02.488
September 15th... But that's in six months!

17:02.554 --> 17:04.857
Hernán, a wine cellar can't be built in six months.

17:06.158 --> 17:08.160
Hernán, it can't be done!

17:33.252 --> 17:36.722
This winery was founded over a 100 years ago by my grandfather:

17:37.723 --> 17:38.924
Eduardo Ibáñez.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.461
He was a country man.

17:42.561 --> 17:45.197
His hands were torn from working and only owned a small piece of land.

17:46.298 --> 17:48.467
He began by selling his wine in bulk.

17:48.567 --> 17:51.036
And look, Gonzalo, look.

17:53.238 --> 17:54.306
A dreamer.

17:56.909 --> 17:59.478
On one of his trips he even went to a fair in Paris.

18:01.046 --> 18:03.449
-And guess what he brought back? -What?

18:03.549 --> 18:04.483
Look.

18:08.320 --> 18:09.488
But this is...

18:10.923 --> 18:12.558
a dome by Gustave Eiffel!

18:14.326 --> 18:16.795
He fell in love with one of those boulevard kiosks

18:16.895 --> 18:18.297
and didn't stop until it was built.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.666
My grandfather was a personality.

18:28.273 --> 18:31.243
Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm not Gustave Eiffel.

18:33.579 --> 18:35.848
We're from another generation, Gonzalo.

18:36.982 --> 18:40.619
That was my grandfather's dream, I have a different one.

18:40.686 --> 18:41.620
What is it?

18:43.789 --> 18:46.859
I dream with a bottle of our fine wine on Easter Island.

18:48.494 --> 18:51.930
I want to take Jerez out into the world. It's time, that's why I called you.

18:57.469 --> 19:00.472
-This is the place. -Six months?

19:00.539 --> 19:03.108
Six months. What do you think? Will we see the miracle?

19:04.343 --> 19:08.313
I haven't travelled this far for nothing. I'll try, but I can't promise anything.

19:08.380 --> 19:09.548
That's my boy!

19:12.351 --> 19:13.352
C'mon, let's go.

19:15.721 --> 19:17.823
-What are you doing? -Taking some notes.

19:17.890 --> 19:20.192
Stop that. Aren't you hungry? Let's get some food.

19:20.292 --> 19:22.661
-I'll finish this and return to the hotel. -No way.

19:22.728 --> 19:25.731
-You're coming to my house. -I don't want to cause any trouble.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.033
-Wait, I'm almost done. Please. -C'mon, let's go.

19:31.703 --> 19:34.706
-Can I bring you anything? -No, no, not the first.

19:34.806 --> 19:36.742
Give your father some cheese.

19:41.213 --> 19:44.216
Adela, the table, Adela!

19:44.816 --> 19:46.718
So, is everything ok?

19:47.085 --> 19:48.520
Yes. You're very kind.

19:53.759 --> 19:55.327
Rosario, bring more wine.

19:57.362 --> 19:59.698
We heard about your accident.

20:03.569 --> 20:05.737
Don't worry, everything's fine.

20:05.837 --> 20:08.040
Well, that's it. You must rest.

20:08.840 --> 20:11.043
Do you think it'll be ready for the wedding?

20:11.109 --> 20:12.911
Of course it will. It will.

20:13.011 --> 20:15.280
What do we want another wine cellar for?

20:15.380 --> 20:18.550
It's all sorted out, Evaristo. Don't forget we'll be rich after this.

20:18.617 --> 20:22.020
Yes, very rich... We've got one already, actually two, why another one?

20:22.087 --> 20:23.789
Hernán knows his business, father.

20:24.923 --> 20:27.726
All I know is that you don't need pockets for "the final trip".

20:27.793 --> 20:31.463
-Oh, my husband! So full of joy! -Knock on wood.

20:32.598 --> 20:35.867
God will keep you here for many years, even if you insist on the opposite.

20:35.934 --> 20:38.470
We all want to see it. Now it's time to make a toast.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.439
-C'mon, everybody. -May the wine flow.

20:40.539 --> 20:42.307
-Do you all have a glass? -Thanks.

20:43.642 --> 20:47.079
My friend Gonzalo played hard to get, but he's finally here. So...

20:47.145 --> 20:48.747
a toast to Mr. Architect.

20:48.814 --> 20:50.649
-Cheers. -Cheers.

20:50.749 --> 20:52.284
Cheers.

20:53.285 --> 20:55.387
Is it true you've been in all those countries?

20:56.255 --> 20:58.156
-Yes. -And how are they?

20:59.958 --> 21:00.926
Different.

21:03.595 --> 21:05.731
Take me with you next time you go, ok?

21:05.797 --> 21:06.898
-Adela! -What?

21:06.965 --> 21:09.968
-You're too much, my God! -Mother, leave her alone.

21:10.068 --> 21:12.137
Excuse her, she's been very outspoken since her father's not with us.

21:12.237 --> 21:14.006
-Don't worry, it's ok. -You...

21:16.942 --> 21:18.343
Gonzalo,

21:18.443 --> 21:20.812
why don't you tell her about Rome?

21:29.087 --> 21:31.990
Rome is the first city I visited after I finished college.

21:32.858 --> 21:35.193
I wasn't playing hard to get, as Hernán said,

21:35.294 --> 21:38.630
but back then I thought I should learn before I started to work.

21:38.697 --> 21:40.198
It's the cradle of architecture.

21:43.168 --> 21:44.670
The city's memory is intact.

21:44.770 --> 21:47.639
Its buildings have survived for centuries, they share its History.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.208
They outlasted time.

21:50.309 --> 21:53.779
And is that what you want? To challenge the test of time?

21:56.548 --> 21:58.650
That's a good way to put it.

21:58.717 --> 22:01.353
When the wine cellar is finished, I'll take you to Rome, Adela.

22:01.453 --> 22:02.821
You're not being serious.

22:57.275 --> 23:01.012
-Where were you? -I had to take my uncle's bike.

23:01.079 --> 23:02.180
C'mon, hop on.

23:03.048 --> 23:05.450
-It doesn't work. -Just wait and see.

23:05.550 --> 23:07.719
See, see how it works? See how it works?

23:07.786 --> 23:09.855
Curro, careful, we're going to fall!

23:20.766 --> 23:21.700
What do you think?

23:22.801 --> 23:24.870
It's good, it's great.

23:25.971 --> 23:28.073
Lucía, what do you think?

23:31.376 --> 23:32.477
Do you like it?

23:33.779 --> 23:35.480
I do, but I think it doesn't...

23:38.383 --> 23:39.217
Say it.

23:41.620 --> 23:43.722
Well, if we want to maximize the use of space,

23:43.789 --> 23:46.158
we have to build a bigger wine cellar, Hernán.

23:46.892 --> 23:48.760
We can't keep doing the same old thing.

23:49.261 --> 23:51.329
What same old thing, love? There's nothing like it.

23:51.430 --> 23:52.330
I know, but...

23:54.833 --> 23:56.334
What I'm saying is that...

23:59.104 --> 24:01.173
if we add an extra floor here,

24:02.407 --> 24:04.943
we'll have a lot more room

24:05.010 --> 24:06.244
and we'll be able to store...

24:06.745 --> 24:09.781
brandy barrels. And in the leftover space

24:09.848 --> 24:11.616
we can store more wine barrels.

24:14.820 --> 24:16.021
And...

24:16.655 --> 24:19.791
we can replace the gable roof with two concrete domes.

24:19.858 --> 24:22.260
Something similar was done at the Algeciras Market.

24:22.327 --> 24:25.597
This way we'll get greater thermal stability.

24:29.367 --> 24:30.502
When do we start?

24:33.939 --> 24:36.441
They say it's good luck to take a picture before you start.

24:36.508 --> 24:38.844
-Who says that? -I do.

24:38.944 --> 24:40.445
-Now? -Now.

24:40.512 --> 24:41.346
Come here.

24:43.014 --> 24:45.183
In that summer of 1958

24:45.283 --> 24:47.552
everything must have been different of how it is now.

24:48.286 --> 24:52.357
In the heat of a snooze disguised as mid-late afternoon love,

24:52.457 --> 24:55.060
he discovered her through his lens,

24:55.160 --> 24:57.062
immortalizing her forever.

24:57.562 --> 25:01.333
That picture said so many things that silence was enough.

25:01.833 --> 25:05.637
He knew then he'd live in those eyes the rest of his life.

25:06.037 --> 25:09.307
That moment transformed that summer into his everlasting moment.

25:11.543 --> 25:14.513
-Did you write this? -Do you like it?

25:15.847 --> 25:17.983
-And what do you want to do now? -Publish it.

25:18.049 --> 25:20.919
Didn't I tell you to let it be, to take care of the obituaries?

25:21.019 --> 25:22.521
Aren't you interested, Mr. Mauricio?

25:22.587 --> 25:25.524
Someone's been sending these obituaries to his death wife for ten years.

25:25.590 --> 25:28.593
Don't you find that interesting? Don't you think there's a story there?

25:28.693 --> 25:32.697
It isn't profitable. Besides, obituaries are normally signed by family members.

25:32.764 --> 25:35.867
But these aren't, not even a name. Only these initials: G.M.

25:35.934 --> 25:38.203
-Mr. Mauricio, with your permission, I can... -I need something else.

25:38.270 --> 25:40.939
This is journalism, we aren't novelists.

25:41.039 --> 25:44.109
The five Ws: who, when, what, where, why.

25:44.209 --> 25:45.777
That's from Journalism 101.

25:48.380 --> 25:51.416
And the permission? That's from Ethics 101.

25:55.287 --> 25:56.755
Santa Coimbra.

25:58.690 --> 25:59.424
What?

26:01.426 --> 26:05.030
"Dear Lucía, every sunset brings me a passing memory of you,

26:05.463 --> 26:09.467
a dream that vanishes each time the sun sets in the horizon

26:09.568 --> 26:11.736
and the tides separate me from the land.

26:12.904 --> 26:14.739
Wait for me when the tide is low.

26:18.877 --> 26:20.912
There's only one house in this area

26:20.979 --> 26:23.381
which can only be reached to when the tide is low."

26:40.932 --> 26:43.001
-Visits aren't until tomorrow. -What?

26:47.339 --> 26:49.641
-Aren't you the realtor? -No,

26:49.741 --> 26:52.444
I work for El Faro de Cantaloa. I'm here about the obituaries.

26:52.510 --> 26:54.412
No, we're not publishing any.

26:54.479 --> 26:57.082
We'd rather handle my father's death discreetly.

27:01.987 --> 27:02.821
He died?

27:06.124 --> 27:07.792
I didn't know, I'm sorry.

27:07.859 --> 27:11.429
Listen, I don't know who you are or if you knew my dad, but you're a week late.

27:12.597 --> 27:14.532
No, I didn't know him,

27:14.633 --> 27:18.036
but I know he'd been writing obituaries to his dead wife for years.

27:18.136 --> 27:19.671
Every September 15th.

27:20.105 --> 27:22.374
-Is this a joke? -No.

27:34.152 --> 27:37.455
I think you should check your sources. My mom's name isn't Lucía.

27:38.390 --> 27:42.160
Another fact. I talked to her on the phone half an hour ago and she's still alive.

27:44.362 --> 27:46.531
Besides, that woman died in 1958?

27:47.032 --> 27:48.633
How old do you think I am?

27:50.201 --> 27:51.469
You found the wrong person.

28:01.713 --> 28:04.315
Just one more question: what was your father's name?

28:05.050 --> 28:07.485
-Why do you care? -I can look it up in the Registry.

28:08.586 --> 28:09.587
Gonzalo Medina.

28:10.722 --> 28:14.693
Gonzalo Medina. "G.M." That's how he signed, it's in every obituary.

28:14.759 --> 28:15.927
DEAR LUCÍA

28:16.361 --> 28:18.329
And listen to this:

28:18.396 --> 28:20.899
"When the sun sets between the Atlantic and the Cantabric,

28:20.999 --> 28:23.668
and the tide separates me from the land, wait for me on the stone porch".

28:23.735 --> 28:25.737
It's about this house, it has to be your father.

28:28.606 --> 28:29.774
Hello?

28:29.874 --> 28:32.444
-Hello? Can you hear me? -Yes, sorry.

28:32.911 --> 28:36.448
-Did he get the right address? -Almost there, but we missed the turnoff.

28:43.621 --> 28:45.423
I don't know what you're talking about.

28:46.291 --> 28:48.426
They're coming to assess the house, so if you don't mind...

28:50.261 --> 28:53.965
I wrote an article about him, I'll give you a copy.

28:58.236 --> 28:59.204
No.

29:02.073 --> 29:03.942
The realtor is optimistic.

29:07.545 --> 29:09.214
Yes, yes, I lowered it.

29:12.117 --> 29:14.419
I'll be home as soon as possible.

29:17.455 --> 29:18.656
Yes, me too.

29:28.399 --> 29:30.568
I'll call you back in a bit, ok?

29:33.571 --> 29:34.506
I love you.

29:59.364 --> 30:00.131
Dear Lucía:

30:01.266 --> 30:03.768
How could we forget that summer we had?

30:04.803 --> 30:07.939
"There are unchosen moments that end up changing you.

30:08.973 --> 30:11.042
It must have happened to him there,

30:11.509 --> 30:13.511
seeing the joy on their faces.

30:16.514 --> 30:18.683
You could touch their happiness,

30:18.783 --> 30:20.852
slipping through their fingertips.

30:21.886 --> 30:24.189
Anybody would have wanted to feel something like it."

30:40.371 --> 30:43.708
You you were fully invested in getting another one of those. What was it?

30:43.808 --> 30:45.577
-Daiquiri. -Fucking daiquiri.

30:45.677 --> 30:48.713
-A drink that tastes like medicine. -No, it's delicious. You have to try it.

30:48.813 --> 30:51.416
My grandfather owned the sugar factory until '98.

30:51.516 --> 30:53.718
Then it got ugly and they had to come back.

30:53.818 --> 30:57.388
Listen, Batista better be careful, or those bearded men will revolt.

30:57.856 --> 31:00.692
C'mon, Juan, what's wrong? Are you a communist now?

31:01.259 --> 31:05.330
I'd put those fuckers in front of the calf for a run. They'd shit their pants.

31:05.396 --> 31:08.166
You can't keep the nation in submission, Miguel, instinct takes over in the end.

31:08.566 --> 31:11.069
Times are changing, right? What do you think?

31:11.169 --> 31:13.738
Don't get into trouble, Juan. What has to happen in Cuba will happen.

31:13.838 --> 31:15.039
Our things first.

31:15.106 --> 31:17.508
Juan Montes is in charge of tagging the new wine.

31:18.042 --> 31:20.111
He's promised me a glowing signboard on Puerta del Sol.

31:20.211 --> 31:22.247
Hernán, step by step.

31:22.881 --> 31:26.517
Hernán is fixated on getting half of the world drunk.

31:27.185 --> 31:30.054
Not half, the whole world.

31:31.256 --> 31:34.726
-Stop it, come here. -What's wrong, woman? My God.

31:36.628 --> 31:39.230
Gonzalo, what's up? You're very quiet today.

31:39.864 --> 31:42.100
Is there anything you need? How's construction going?

31:42.200 --> 31:43.534
-Go ahead. -Give me that, c'mon.

31:45.303 --> 31:47.872
You better, because you've taken all the construction workers.

31:47.939 --> 31:51.242
-All those bastards work for you. -Maybe it's because I'm paying them.

31:51.309 --> 31:53.878
Don't be so cocky because I'm paying mine too, ok?

31:53.945 --> 31:56.314
The herd doesn't maintain itself.

31:57.482 --> 31:58.983
Yes or no?

31:59.083 --> 32:00.752
C'mon, c'mon!

32:06.557 --> 32:10.261
Lucía, Miguel brought it to me from one of his trips.

32:10.328 --> 32:12.163
-And what about you? -What about me?

32:12.263 --> 32:15.466
What's your plan for your wedding night? You want Hernán to be happy.

32:15.566 --> 32:16.601
C'mon, help me.

32:18.336 --> 32:20.171
So, no? You still haven't...?

32:21.306 --> 32:22.907
Well, we've done our share of things.

32:23.574 --> 32:27.111
And what's he like? My legs trembled every time Miguel came close to me.

32:27.178 --> 32:29.113
We should wait, right? If we have to wait, we'll wait.

32:29.614 --> 32:32.350
Tradition is one thing and desire another very different one, it goes beyond rules.

32:32.450 --> 32:35.954
It's like a cliff, you feel vertigo. Then you look out, something draws you in

32:36.020 --> 32:38.656
and, even if you don't want to, you have no choice but to free fall.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.963
Listen to me, Lucía, this moment isn't coming back.

32:45.029 --> 32:48.967
Make the most of it. They say they want you forever, but they forget you exist later.

32:50.201 --> 32:52.470
He's handsome, right? The architect.

32:52.537 --> 32:56.140
He's studied, travelled... The girl who gets him will be lucky.

32:56.207 --> 32:58.042
He lives for his job.

32:58.142 --> 33:00.645
They all have their vices, Lucía.

33:00.712 --> 33:02.981
Your little sister-in-law, Adela, is really into him.

33:06.184 --> 33:09.320
-I wish I was young again, right? -But you're young, Rocío, my God.

33:09.387 --> 33:12.390
Well, us mothers aren't young anymore, only mothers.

33:12.490 --> 33:13.725
What do you mean "mothers"?

33:19.397 --> 33:20.999
Are you with child?

33:21.065 --> 33:24.002
-My God, congratulations! -Thank you.

33:24.068 --> 33:26.504
-How far along are you? -Very little.

33:28.039 --> 33:30.675
I haven't seen him smoking since we were students.

33:30.742 --> 33:32.143
I'm not used to it.

33:33.678 --> 33:37.548
One gets used to the good things quickly. C'mon, I'll get you another one.

33:37.648 --> 33:39.484
And me too, ok?

33:39.550 --> 33:42.186
Don't you worry about anything, shorty.

33:42.253 --> 33:44.422
A little bit here

33:44.522 --> 33:46.424
and another little bit here.

33:46.524 --> 33:49.427
C'mon. C'mon, just a little. C'mon, man.

33:49.527 --> 33:53.064
-Careful, don't you fall off the horse. -No way!

33:53.164 --> 33:55.666
You have to eat a lot to win me over, shorty.

33:55.733 --> 33:58.603
I have a BH over there that's a wonder. Fuck, drink.

34:31.702 --> 34:33.371
Does your brother let you drink?

34:34.972 --> 34:36.140
Are you my mother?

34:39.043 --> 34:42.447
-She has a strong character. -That must be very common around here.

34:58.096 --> 34:59.564
You won't lack work here.

35:02.066 --> 35:04.001
I feel very flattered, you're very kind.

35:05.303 --> 35:07.572
Shouldn't you give that some thought?

35:07.638 --> 35:09.640
First your wine cellar and later, we'll see.

35:11.576 --> 35:13.911
-C'mon! Go, Miguel, go! -C'mon!

35:14.445 --> 35:15.179
Miguel!

35:33.965 --> 35:35.166
Congratulations.

35:36.968 --> 35:38.102
We're on a winning streak.

35:44.308 --> 35:46.944
-Can I help you? -No need.

35:54.285 --> 35:56.187
I wish someone would carry me like that.

35:58.156 --> 36:00.057
Someday, you're still very young.

36:00.158 --> 36:01.659
Not so much,

36:01.726 --> 36:04.896
but my brother treats me as if I were a little girl.

36:05.563 --> 36:07.632
Because you're a little girl.

36:09.367 --> 36:11.502
And you? How old are you?

36:17.675 --> 36:18.876
I'm older.

36:22.346 --> 36:25.516
And how did you do it? How did you leave home so soon?

36:27.018 --> 36:28.686
I knew what I wanted to be.

36:29.820 --> 36:31.222
I don't know what I want to be.

36:32.089 --> 36:35.893
But I do know that I don't want to miss out on the world by staying here.

36:38.262 --> 36:41.766
I've been many places and, believe me, this one has nothing to envy.

36:43.668 --> 36:46.337
Can you imagine spending your whole life in the same place?

36:46.404 --> 36:48.039
I'll leave any day now, you'll see.

36:49.173 --> 36:50.241
With that boy?

36:52.843 --> 36:53.678
With who?

36:54.178 --> 36:55.947
That boy.

36:57.582 --> 36:58.683
With Curro?

37:01.953 --> 37:03.187
Yes. I don't know.

37:03.254 --> 37:07.892
He's very nice with me, very kind, but I know my brother wouldn't consent.

37:07.959 --> 37:11.262
I don't think your brother will deny you anything you ask of him, I know him.

37:11.362 --> 37:12.463
Talk to him.

37:13.965 --> 37:15.700
You think?

37:15.766 --> 37:17.702
-What's up, lovebirds? -Nothing.

37:20.104 --> 37:21.239
Shall we go?

37:21.305 --> 37:24.208
No, I'll walk, I feel like taking a walk.

37:24.275 --> 37:27.278
-Adela, go home, ok? -Ok.

37:27.378 --> 37:30.481
-Shouldn't we take her? -No, it's ok. If she wants to walk...

37:30.581 --> 37:32.583
Besides, this way we don't waste time.

37:38.556 --> 37:42.159
-Go that way! -No way! No way!

37:42.260 --> 37:43.461
No!

37:43.561 --> 37:45.096
-Hey! -What's up?

37:46.230 --> 37:47.565
Hey!

37:47.632 --> 37:50.968
This man has helped us for years. One of the few that will hire us.

37:51.068 --> 37:53.938
-It's better that you stealing from us. -What a jerk.

37:56.440 --> 37:58.009
We're very hard working people,

37:58.109 --> 38:00.478
that's the bad name we get from other places.

38:00.578 --> 38:03.447
But we're absolutely loyal to the family.

38:03.514 --> 38:04.749
Take care of him.

38:04.815 --> 38:07.118
Once he's your friend, he won't forget about you.

38:07.184 --> 38:10.454
Hey, Cortés, bring that Palo Cortado you have hiding somewhere.

38:10.521 --> 38:11.989
Right away.

38:40.284 --> 38:41.452
What about Lucía?

38:43.721 --> 38:46.824
Do you know that I already knew her before I went to college?

38:46.891 --> 38:48.993
She was a child when I left. When I saw her again,

38:49.060 --> 38:51.329
I knew I would spend the rest of my life with her.

38:52.463 --> 38:54.532
-And did she know? -She said yes.

38:56.801 --> 38:59.837
And what about you? My sister has her eye on you.

38:59.904 --> 39:02.907
-I'm marrying her tomorrow. -You have to go through me first.

39:27.998 --> 39:30.067
Do you really want to write about my father?

39:30.935 --> 39:31.702
Yes.

39:32.036 --> 39:34.205
Ok then, you have my permission to publish it.

39:34.605 --> 39:37.174
But first I would like to know who she is.

39:43.781 --> 39:44.915
It could be Lucía.

39:45.683 --> 39:48.853
You need your article, but I need to know who my father was.

39:52.223 --> 39:54.925
Before he retired here, he lived many years abroad.

39:55.025 --> 39:57.461
He might have published more obituaries.

40:05.736 --> 40:07.605
A few days? But you just started.

40:07.705 --> 40:10.474
I know, Mr. Mauricio, but it was you who told me about the little stories,

40:10.574 --> 40:13.310
to open my eyes, the five W's. There's something here, I'm sure.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.613
And I have his permission.

40:15.713 --> 40:17.782
I hope you come back with a good feature at least.

40:17.882 --> 40:21.585
Thank you, Mr. Mauricio. Oh, and one more thing.

40:21.652 --> 40:23.254
Do we have a newspaper car?

40:23.788 --> 40:25.656
Hey, I'll call you later.

40:25.756 --> 40:26.791
Good bye.

40:38.969 --> 40:40.671
What's this?

40:40.771 --> 40:43.407
They used it to cover the Ciclist Tour.

40:43.841 --> 40:46.977
...trash. There's always a day...

40:47.077 --> 40:48.646
to start.

40:48.746 --> 40:52.183
Beware of the crocodiles,

40:52.283 --> 40:55.653
they come slowly and you never see them.

40:55.753 --> 40:59.023
-They ate her up... -...smiled calmly...

40:59.123 --> 41:01.358
Do you want to listen to something else? I have Pearl Jam.

41:02.760 --> 41:03.828
I don't like it.

41:10.367 --> 41:11.335
Read this.

41:13.537 --> 41:14.805
"Dear Lucía,

41:14.872 --> 41:17.541
I never thought these things could happen,

41:17.641 --> 41:19.477
it wasn't in my plans.

41:20.177 --> 41:23.280
And then I realized you can't choose."

41:24.348 --> 41:28.118
The death of a flower as beautiful as a rose can never bring any good with it.

41:32.890 --> 41:36.961
Mr. Hernán! Mr. Hernán!

41:37.027 --> 41:39.864
Mr. Hernán! Mr. Hernán!

41:41.732 --> 41:44.802
-Mr. Hernán! -What's wrong, Julio?

41:44.869 --> 41:47.738
The roses, sir! The roses are withered!

41:48.239 --> 41:50.474
When we got here this morning, they were withered.

41:51.709 --> 41:53.677
Hernán, what's wrong?

41:53.744 --> 41:56.580
-When did this start? -We saw it this morning.

41:56.680 --> 41:59.383
Julio, we have to be on top of this. On top, Julio, do you understand?

41:59.483 --> 42:02.052
Something from abroad must've come and contaminated the vineyard.

42:02.152 --> 42:03.921
Send all the men there. And you must warn the wineries.

42:04.021 --> 42:05.856
-What happened? -I want to know if it started already or not.

42:05.923 --> 42:09.193
That's impossible. Phylloxera was eradicated ages ago.

42:09.260 --> 42:11.662
It's not Phylloxera, shit! It's a fungus.

42:11.729 --> 42:13.931
-Hernán, what's wrong? -Some hellish bugs.

42:15.199 --> 42:18.102
Boy, go check the other vineyard!

42:18.202 --> 42:20.905
These sons of bitches are going to ruin the next ten-year harvest!

42:21.005 --> 42:22.006
Go, quickly!

42:22.072 --> 42:23.507
C'mon, you all heard me!

42:26.710 --> 42:30.247
That's great, what's going to happen now with all the wages that are due?

42:30.347 --> 42:32.249
I'll have to respond accordingly, as it is custom.

42:32.349 --> 42:36.220
Mother, talk with Industrial Jerez. They'll give us credit for now.

42:36.287 --> 42:38.188
And when will that be? There's no time.

42:38.255 --> 42:40.591
What about the bottler and all those labels?

42:40.691 --> 42:42.960
The people at Plaza del Mamelón don't work for free.

42:43.060 --> 42:45.296
If we talk to them, we might be able to recover something.

42:45.396 --> 42:47.698
-And we must stop construction. -We're not stopping anything.

42:47.765 --> 42:51.201
We're moving forward. The other winery hasn't seen anything.

42:51.268 --> 42:53.370
-They haven't stirred up the soil. -Evaristo...

42:53.704 --> 42:55.940
-This is how things are. -This again?

42:59.476 --> 43:01.712
I talked to Juan Pedro.

43:01.779 --> 43:05.783
There was a similar outbreak in Bordeaux, France, and they eradicated it.

43:05.883 --> 43:08.052
-I'm going there this afternoon. -I'll go with you.

43:08.118 --> 43:11.255
I need you here, at the winery and at the wine cellar's construction.

43:11.322 --> 43:14.758
Lucía, let Hernán take care of it, this is a man's job, dear.

43:15.893 --> 43:18.896
-Hernán, can we have a word? -This is not a good time.

43:24.735 --> 43:27.671
Promise me you'll keep construction going. We're solving the credit problem.

43:27.771 --> 43:28.806
Don't worry about it.

43:38.015 --> 43:40.951
-Promise me you'll take care of her. -You're not going to war.

43:42.119 --> 43:44.188
-Fucking promise me. -Go inside.

44:39.810 --> 44:41.145
This is a land of wells.

44:42.246 --> 44:44.248
If there was once water,

44:45.549 --> 44:46.684
it'll come back.

44:55.192 --> 44:56.727
-Romeo. -Yes?

44:56.827 --> 44:58.729
-I'll be back in a moment. -Very well.

45:12.443 --> 45:14.945
I'd never been in this part of the wine cellar.

45:15.512 --> 45:18.348
It's very nice, there's lots of light.

45:26.056 --> 45:28.726
We learned from my grandfather, he was a cooper.

45:29.593 --> 45:32.362
I didn't know how to make wine, but I knew how to take care of it.

45:33.397 --> 45:34.531
They're signed.

45:36.800 --> 45:37.901
It's tradition.

45:42.039 --> 45:44.975
We don't know what's inside, but we keep it for years.

45:46.110 --> 45:48.278
Then we take it out of the barrels and put it into the "solera".

45:48.378 --> 45:50.280
And we make people a little happier.

45:56.787 --> 45:58.222
Why is it called "solera"?

46:03.927 --> 46:05.462
Because it's on the floor.

46:13.804 --> 46:16.807
I doubt you can drink time like this anywhere else.

46:32.689 --> 46:36.326
Lucía, the builders, they don't want to work!

46:37.528 --> 46:40.364
They left, all the builders have left.

46:40.464 --> 46:42.499
The construction site's empty.

46:42.599 --> 46:43.934
This one's for me.

46:49.773 --> 46:51.208
What are you doing here?

46:51.308 --> 46:53.644
I gave them the day off, no one works today.

46:53.710 --> 46:56.146
-Are you drunk? -As a skunk.

46:57.881 --> 46:58.649
Romeo.

46:59.449 --> 47:02.352
Those vines are doomed, Gonzalo. If we don't get paid, we don't work.

47:02.452 --> 47:04.121
-We will pay. -Really, missy?

47:04.188 --> 47:04.955
C'mon!

47:08.725 --> 47:10.661
I have eight mouths to feed.

47:10.727 --> 47:12.896
Are you going to set a plate for them at your table?

47:12.996 --> 47:15.532
-What do you need? -Are you going to pay me?

47:17.568 --> 47:19.636
What the fuck do you want?

47:19.703 --> 47:21.038
Well... I don't know,

47:21.138 --> 47:24.241
something to restore our trust, don't you think?

47:36.687 --> 47:37.988
Your trust.

47:39.223 --> 47:42.860
You take it as guarantee and, if you're not paid, you can sell it.

47:42.926 --> 47:44.061
And now back to work.

47:45.195 --> 47:46.096
Yes.

47:47.531 --> 47:49.733
And to the vineyards, darling,

47:49.833 --> 47:52.035
don't go by yourself,

47:52.102 --> 47:55.539
there are many aphids at any given time.

47:56.340 --> 47:59.409
Jesús, my tap's on the lady!

48:04.948 --> 48:07.551
-Good afternoon. -Do I know you?

48:07.618 --> 48:10.787
Probably, yes, since I'm from there, from San Miguel, close to Cruz Vieja.

48:10.888 --> 48:12.789
-My name is Curro. -And what do you want?

48:14.057 --> 48:18.028
I thought you might need an extra hand, don't you?

48:18.095 --> 48:21.632
And can you do anything else besides hang around the Ibanez house?

48:21.732 --> 48:25.269
Well, my uncle says I'm not very smart, but I can assure you I learn fast.

48:25.369 --> 48:27.804
Truth is I don't want to stay at the cooperage forever.

48:27.905 --> 48:31.608
-I don't want to lose my fingers either. -Sorry, this isn't a good time.

48:31.708 --> 48:35.279
Listen, I can do anything, ok? Whatever you need, please.

48:37.247 --> 48:39.316
If Romeo said something, he's from Trebujena,

48:39.416 --> 48:42.085
who don't get along with people from El Cuervo, like my dad, you know?

48:42.152 --> 48:44.154
You better talk to Hernán Ibáñez.

48:51.895 --> 48:53.063
Thank you very much.

48:55.832 --> 48:58.936
-Hernán would've done the same. -But it was you who did it.

49:01.772 --> 49:03.173
Where do those roads lead to?

49:07.477 --> 49:08.578
Do you want to find out?

49:32.135 --> 49:34.037
I come here when I want to relax.

49:34.604 --> 49:36.974
This is my hiding place.

49:47.517 --> 49:49.553
What are you going to do when you finish the wine cellar?

49:53.123 --> 49:54.124
I don't know.

49:55.325 --> 49:58.829
I asked for a scholarship at a studio in Barcelona. They haven't answered yet.

50:01.665 --> 50:03.133
But that's very far away, isn't it?

50:04.868 --> 50:06.203
That depends.

50:08.538 --> 50:12.309
Far from here, yes, but very close to Rubió, Berenguer, Gaudí...

50:14.077 --> 50:16.480
-Do you know what those masters did? -No.

50:16.546 --> 50:18.648
-All the things I could learn there? -No.

50:25.655 --> 50:27.557
At least you'll be close to the sea.

50:28.692 --> 50:31.428
And if the scholarship doesn't go through, you can always come back south.

51:07.097 --> 51:08.031
Can I?

51:09.132 --> 51:10.133
Of course.

51:24.281 --> 51:25.282
It's very easy.

51:26.883 --> 51:27.884
Yes.

51:55.745 --> 51:56.780
Look.

52:01.351 --> 52:02.285
There.

52:05.589 --> 52:06.923
It's a Moorish queen.

52:10.460 --> 52:12.028
They say it comes here to die.

52:33.450 --> 52:34.718
I like how you look at me.

52:36.620 --> 52:37.554
How am I looking?

52:40.123 --> 52:42.025
Like you're looking at me now.

53:17.360 --> 53:18.828
The fair starts tomorrow.

53:21.264 --> 53:22.899
I have a lot of work tomorrow.

53:26.403 --> 53:27.671
I don't want to go by myself.

53:41.251 --> 53:43.220
-See you tomorrow. -See you tomorrow.

53:51.728 --> 53:53.630
-I haven't been here in years. -How many?

53:54.464 --> 53:56.800
Since they sent me to study abroad.

53:56.900 --> 53:59.936
It was the same year my parents got divorced.

54:00.036 --> 54:01.805
Whose decision was it?

54:01.905 --> 54:03.873
To study abroad or to get a divorce?

54:04.975 --> 54:08.245
Who cares? I stopped being a issue for them.

54:08.311 --> 54:10.480
Besides, architecture wasn't my thing.

54:10.580 --> 54:14.751
I didn't need five years in Manchester to end up in my father-in-law's company.

54:15.318 --> 54:18.321
-You're married? -No, almost. I'm engaged.

54:19.389 --> 54:22.459
But, with all this regarding my father, we had to delay the wedding.

54:30.433 --> 54:32.836
So your father never said anything?

54:32.936 --> 54:34.804
He never talked to you about Lucía?

54:34.904 --> 54:38.742
My father wasn't a talker. We weren't close. I don't know.

54:40.277 --> 54:42.846
He was always in his own world, he never did anything with us.

54:51.121 --> 54:52.922
I remember once,

54:52.989 --> 54:55.692
they took me to the fair. I was very small.

54:55.792 --> 54:59.596
My mom and dad still walked hand in hand. So, imagine...

54:59.663 --> 55:02.332
When we returned from the fair, we walked by a clock shop...

55:03.600 --> 55:07.037
and I stood there, with my nose stuck to the window display.

55:07.137 --> 55:08.972
I was spellbound by the clocks.

55:09.806 --> 55:13.543
I saw a watch. It had a silver sphere and you could see the inner mechanism.

55:13.643 --> 55:15.945
I wanted that watch. My father shook his head and said:

55:16.012 --> 55:18.315
"But you don't even know how to read the minute hand".

55:18.381 --> 55:22.185
And it was true. I just liked to look at how the hands moved.

55:22.285 --> 55:25.655
Years later, when we were at the airport and said good-bye,

55:25.722 --> 55:29.225
-my father gave me that watch. -The same one?

55:29.326 --> 55:31.061
Yes, the same one.

55:31.161 --> 55:33.396
You had to wind it up to make it work.

55:33.496 --> 55:36.733
"So you feel responsible for the time you spend."

55:36.833 --> 55:38.335
That's what he said.

55:39.469 --> 55:40.470
You're not wearing it now.

55:41.671 --> 55:42.572
I lost it.

55:43.707 --> 55:46.343
It was a pain in the ass to have to wind it up every day.

55:46.409 --> 55:48.845
I don't need it, my phone tells me the time too.

55:57.187 --> 55:59.356
-Excuse me, the newspaper archive? -Sixth floor.

55:59.422 --> 56:01.658
Thank you!

56:12.736 --> 56:14.504
-Have you found something? -Yes.

56:16.172 --> 56:17.173
Look at this one.

56:20.610 --> 56:23.279
He wrote all this while my mom and I were home.

56:24.514 --> 56:25.515
Why?

56:28.685 --> 56:32.021
To find out, we're going to have to find the rest of the obituaries.

56:34.357 --> 56:38.061
"No one imagined then that Hernán's departure would take us where it did,

56:38.795 --> 56:41.931
to travel that road that I have retraced so many times in my memory,

56:42.699 --> 56:45.468
traveling against the will of time,

56:45.568 --> 56:47.570
and to the days that'll no longer return."

56:48.905 --> 56:51.741
I wish someone would write something like that to me one day.

57:43.159 --> 57:45.195
My love, you look so beautiful!

57:45.295 --> 57:47.363
Where were you, you weren't at the bullfight?

57:47.464 --> 57:48.631
I'm going to dance.

57:57.273 --> 57:58.007
C'mon, come.

58:07.951 --> 58:09.686
-I don't think coming was a good idea. -What?

58:09.786 --> 58:12.155
-I don't think coming was a good idea. -Why?

58:14.023 --> 58:15.859
-Gonzalo, let's dance. -No.

58:15.959 --> 58:17.961
Let's dance, Gonzalo.

58:18.027 --> 58:21.297
Why did we come here? To see everyone dance but us?

59:45.748 --> 59:47.116
-Have you seen Lucía? -No.

1:00:19.816 --> 1:00:21.951
Don't touch me. Don't touch me, please.

1:00:24.287 --> 1:00:25.421
Hey, you, let go of her!

1:00:26.656 --> 1:00:28.191
Let go of me!

1:00:32.095 --> 1:00:33.029
Leave him alone!

1:00:33.129 --> 1:00:35.465
-What are you doing? -Miguel, go away! You're drunk!

1:00:39.002 --> 1:00:40.770
What's going on?

1:00:40.837 --> 1:00:44.107
You'd rather be with this piece of shit? Is that it?

1:01:07.196 --> 1:01:09.065
Stop. Stop.

1:01:09.666 --> 1:01:11.701
-Stop! -What's wrong?

1:01:22.245 --> 1:01:23.179
Come.

1:01:25.014 --> 1:01:25.915
Come!

1:01:33.589 --> 1:01:34.557
What?

1:01:37.493 --> 1:01:38.394
What?

1:01:51.774 --> 1:01:53.876
What?

1:02:01.851 --> 1:02:03.519
He beat my face in!

1:02:05.221 --> 1:02:07.090
That's what I get for acting brave.

1:05:46.842 --> 1:05:49.178
SAGUNTO PORT

1:05:50.780 --> 1:05:52.081
It doesn't say anything else.

1:05:54.183 --> 1:05:56.752
He slept with a woman that was engaged.

1:05:56.819 --> 1:05:57.753
No,

1:05:59.422 --> 1:06:01.257
he slept with the woman he loved.

1:06:08.297 --> 1:06:09.265
Look at this.

1:06:10.366 --> 1:06:12.802
It's the first time he published when he started to live here.

1:06:15.271 --> 1:06:18.641
"Dear Lucía, I'm not used to these streets yet.

1:06:19.775 --> 1:06:23.045
I'm returning from the place where Elvira's sad verses still echo...

1:06:24.547 --> 1:06:27.149
reminding me that some pleasures last only an instant,

1:06:28.484 --> 1:06:30.019
but will remain forever."

1:06:37.560 --> 1:06:38.828
Yes, that's it.

1:06:38.894 --> 1:06:42.531
Published between 1962 and 1967.

1:06:45.735 --> 1:06:48.004
Could you tell me what's written on the obituary?

1:06:54.744 --> 1:06:56.012
Are you sure?

1:06:57.847 --> 1:06:59.815
Could you keep it for us...

1:06:59.882 --> 1:07:00.916
Thanks.

1:07:06.389 --> 1:07:08.090
What does the obituary say?

1:07:16.332 --> 1:07:18.401
It says someone died that summer.

1:07:18.501 --> 1:07:19.869
What a surprise!

1:07:19.935 --> 1:07:22.872
No, it's not about Lucía.

1:07:24.607 --> 1:07:26.275
It's about someone else.

1:07:29.245 --> 1:07:30.880
But who?

1:07:35.851 --> 1:07:38.120
Hey, hey, stop!

1:07:38.921 --> 1:07:41.891
-What's going on? -Stop moving the shovel!

1:07:41.957 --> 1:07:43.359
Don't you see?

1:07:51.467 --> 1:07:52.935
I'm taking this one home.

1:07:57.239 --> 1:07:58.574
Won't it die?

1:07:58.641 --> 1:08:00.876
If it's never looked at the sky, it won't care.

1:08:02.078 --> 1:08:03.079
Excuse me.

1:08:04.480 --> 1:08:05.881
-Hi. -Hi.

1:08:05.948 --> 1:08:07.116
Are you very busy?

1:08:08.250 --> 1:08:09.785
I would like to show you something.

1:08:16.826 --> 1:08:17.960
Ok, let's go.

1:08:28.304 --> 1:08:30.639
-What's up? -Nothing.

1:08:53.028 --> 1:08:53.996
Where are we going?

1:09:02.304 --> 1:09:03.506
This is amazing.

1:09:14.049 --> 1:09:17.286
I don't want to hurt anyone. Hernán is my friend.

1:10:34.096 --> 1:10:36.065
Do you know the legend of the Taj Mahal?

1:10:39.768 --> 1:10:40.903
No.

1:10:42.238 --> 1:10:44.740
An emperor had it built in honor of his wife.

1:10:45.874 --> 1:10:48.277
They say he went mad the first time he saw her.

1:10:49.745 --> 1:10:53.215
After twenty years of marriage, she died during childbirth.

1:10:54.416 --> 1:10:58.487
They say her last words were to ask her husband for four wishes.

1:10:58.587 --> 1:11:01.056
Wish number one: that he'd be a good father.

1:11:01.123 --> 1:11:04.093
Wish number two: that he would remarry.

1:11:04.159 --> 1:11:06.228
Number three: that he built a tomb in her honor.

1:11:06.962 --> 1:11:07.896
And number four:

1:11:07.963 --> 1:11:11.233
that he would visit her at that grave every anniversary of her death.

1:11:15.271 --> 1:11:16.905
And did he deliver?

1:11:16.972 --> 1:11:19.742
Five centuries later his promise still stands.

1:11:34.857 --> 1:11:36.458
Did he stop time?

1:11:41.163 --> 1:11:44.700
He didn't stop time, only capture it.

1:11:46.035 --> 1:11:48.704
Time is boundless, it never stops.

1:11:48.804 --> 1:11:50.606
It'll outlast all of us.

1:11:58.480 --> 1:11:59.615
Come.

1:12:00.516 --> 1:12:01.483
Come.

1:12:30.579 --> 1:12:31.880
Manuel!

1:12:32.548 --> 1:12:35.351
Oh la la, la France, Manuel!

1:12:58.374 --> 1:12:59.441
Lucía.

1:13:00.609 --> 1:13:02.244
How are you, my love?

1:13:04.713 --> 1:13:06.548
What happened to your face, Gonzalo?

1:13:08.350 --> 1:13:11.186
-I missed you, baby. -You've only been away for a week.

1:13:11.253 --> 1:13:12.955
It felt very long.

1:13:14.423 --> 1:13:15.858
Come on, let's do the sulphating.

1:13:17.559 --> 1:13:19.395
-Everything ok here? -Yes, fine.

1:13:19.461 --> 1:13:20.462
That's great.

1:13:42.584 --> 1:13:43.619
My boy!

1:13:52.127 --> 1:13:53.061
Hernán...

1:13:54.163 --> 1:13:55.464
It's wonderful!

1:13:57.433 --> 1:13:59.168
-Do you like it? -If I like it?

1:13:59.268 --> 1:14:00.669
-Try it on, baby. -No,

1:14:01.470 --> 1:14:03.472
-I'll save it for a special occasion. -Special?

1:14:03.572 --> 1:14:04.406
Yes.

1:14:04.473 --> 1:14:07.342
But I just returned from France! Isn't that special?

1:14:07.443 --> 1:14:09.845
Yes, but maybe for the wine cellar's inauguration.

1:14:09.945 --> 1:14:11.146
Wow!

1:14:11.246 --> 1:14:12.815
Did you hear, Gonzalo?

1:14:12.915 --> 1:14:16.351
Hurry up now, I want to see my sister in the dress.

1:14:34.269 --> 1:14:36.438
Am I lucky or what?

1:14:40.509 --> 1:14:42.377
This woman wants to marry me!

1:14:55.657 --> 1:14:57.192
To the future!

1:15:28.223 --> 1:15:30.659
-Do you have a minute? -Of course.

1:15:30.726 --> 1:15:31.894
It's about Curro.

1:15:31.994 --> 1:15:33.595
-Curro from the Ojeda family? -Yes.

1:15:33.695 --> 1:15:35.931
What did I tell you? Let it be.

1:15:38.400 --> 1:15:40.502
Gonzalo wouldn't give him work.

1:15:40.569 --> 1:15:43.605
Gonzalo did what he had to do. And that's good, he picks his men.

1:15:43.705 --> 1:15:47.075
Sure. But he's got a drunk working as a foreman. That's better, isn't it?

1:15:47.175 --> 1:15:48.944
I'm just asking you to give him a chance.

1:15:49.044 --> 1:15:50.846
What if Gonzalo isn't as perfect as he seems?

1:15:52.848 --> 1:15:54.950
-What then? -What do you mean?

1:15:55.050 --> 1:15:56.885
Well, he can make mistakes too.

1:15:56.952 --> 1:15:59.855
Hernán, couldn't you talk him into giving Curro a job?

1:15:59.922 --> 1:16:02.024
-I'm not going to do that. -But, why?

1:16:03.125 --> 1:16:05.294
-Did he ask you? -Yes.

1:16:05.394 --> 1:16:07.462
-That slacker asked you to talk to me? -Hernán, he's not a slacker.

1:16:07.563 --> 1:16:09.464
-He's a layabout. -He helps out at his family's cooperage.

1:16:09.565 --> 1:16:11.033
-He does? -Yes.

1:16:11.099 --> 1:16:13.735
We need more men like his father.

1:16:13.802 --> 1:16:16.905
It's too bad he didn't get to know him, he would've learned a lot from him.

1:16:16.972 --> 1:16:19.775
Besides, if his uncle's given him a job, that's it, right?

1:16:22.644 --> 1:16:26.148
-He wants something else. -He won't set foot on this house, ok?

1:16:26.248 --> 1:16:29.251
-Why can't I do anything on my own? -Don't yell at me.

1:16:40.762 --> 1:16:42.965
I say this because I love you.

1:16:43.065 --> 1:16:46.101
You deserve something better. Stay away from him.

1:16:54.943 --> 1:16:56.612
Why don't you talk to Gonzalo?

1:16:59.147 --> 1:17:00.515
That's what you want, isn't it?

1:17:02.351 --> 1:17:03.418
That's why.

1:17:13.028 --> 1:17:14.129
-Lucía. -No.

1:17:14.196 --> 1:17:16.331
Gonzalo, please. Gonzalo, please!

1:17:16.431 --> 1:17:19.034
They'll see us! Not here!

1:17:21.036 --> 1:17:23.005
-Gonzalo, please. -What's wrong?

1:17:24.172 --> 1:17:26.642
-Relax. -Not here, please.

1:17:26.708 --> 1:17:28.844
-I don't understand. -Gonzalo, not here.

1:17:32.981 --> 1:17:33.982
No.

1:17:44.693 --> 1:17:46.528
Wait, wait.

1:17:46.628 --> 1:17:50.632
Let's talk tonight. At the vineyard where we met the first time, at ten.

1:17:56.304 --> 1:17:57.372
Hi.

1:17:58.507 --> 1:18:01.410
The dress is lovely, you'll look great in it.

1:18:01.510 --> 1:18:04.046
If you're still here for the inauguration, you might see it.

1:18:08.650 --> 1:18:11.253
-Hernán, I didn't mean to... -Romeo, we know each other.

1:18:11.353 --> 1:18:13.488
-Hunger isn't patient, is it? -Eight mouths.

1:18:13.555 --> 1:18:15.424
-Eight mouths? I don't think so. -Seven.

1:18:16.558 --> 1:18:19.027
You could've sold it but you didn't. And that saves you, Romero.

1:18:19.094 --> 1:18:20.996
-And the chain? -C'mon now, go.

1:18:21.063 --> 1:18:22.831
Lucía, where were you?

1:18:23.699 --> 1:18:26.101
I had to freshen up, I got a heatstroke.

1:18:26.201 --> 1:18:27.102
Are you ok?

1:18:28.336 --> 1:18:29.705
I better go home.

1:18:31.339 --> 1:18:33.375
Wait, baby. I'll give you a ride.

1:18:52.194 --> 1:18:53.428
Good night.

1:18:58.600 --> 1:18:59.634
Baby.

1:19:02.237 --> 1:19:04.206
Did you think I forgot about you?

1:19:11.279 --> 1:19:12.114
Open it.

1:19:22.390 --> 1:19:23.792
It's a Rose de France.

1:19:30.499 --> 1:19:33.335
The guy who sold it to me said it brings peace and stability.

1:19:37.305 --> 1:19:38.607
It's an amethyst.

1:19:41.109 --> 1:19:43.612
I counted the days to see you again.

1:19:51.419 --> 1:19:52.454
What's the matter, Lucía?

1:19:57.259 --> 1:19:59.461
I'm very tired.

1:19:59.528 --> 1:20:01.429
It was an exhausting week of work.

1:20:01.496 --> 1:20:02.798
But it was worth it.

1:20:02.864 --> 1:20:04.533
You saved the winery.

1:20:26.688 --> 1:20:28.490
Go rest, baby.

1:21:25.780 --> 1:21:28.516
Let's leave. Right now.

1:21:41.596 --> 1:21:42.864
Go back home.

1:22:50.131 --> 1:22:51.333
Adela!

1:22:51.433 --> 1:22:53.368
Adela, wait! Let me explain!

1:22:57.172 --> 1:22:58.673
Adela, it's not what you think!

1:23:07.682 --> 1:23:09.451
No!

1:23:39.647 --> 1:23:40.548
Hernán!

1:23:44.252 --> 1:23:45.053
Hernán!

1:23:46.421 --> 1:23:47.756
Hernán!

1:24:02.704 --> 1:24:05.073
I don't know what happened.

1:24:05.173 --> 1:24:06.408
I couldn't sleep. I went...

1:24:06.508 --> 1:24:10.845
to the vineyards, I heard someone scream.

1:24:11.613 --> 1:24:13.348
I ran and when I found the pit...

1:24:13.415 --> 1:24:16.584
I don't know what she was doing there.

1:25:16.644 --> 1:25:17.779
No, no!

1:27:30.144 --> 1:27:31.913
I'm so sorry.

1:27:38.386 --> 1:27:40.989
I'll finish the wine cellar as soon as possible and I'll leave.

1:27:41.322 --> 1:27:43.591
I don't want to be a bother for the family.

1:28:24.499 --> 1:28:26.200
You're coming with me for a walk now, ok?

1:28:26.301 --> 1:28:28.936
Alfonso, Alfonso... Wait...

1:28:29.003 --> 1:28:29.937
Motherfucker!

1:28:30.004 --> 1:28:30.872
No, no, no!

1:28:44.452 --> 1:28:46.321
-Stay still, ok? -Yes, yes.

1:28:46.387 --> 1:28:48.289
-Stay still! -Yes, yes.

1:28:48.356 --> 1:28:50.491
Ok, ok, ok.

1:29:08.543 --> 1:29:12.146
Here he is. Piece of shit, he pissed himself.

1:29:15.416 --> 1:29:18.353
Listen, Mr. Hernán. I swear.

1:29:18.753 --> 1:29:21.556
No, listen. No, no, no!

1:29:36.037 --> 1:29:39.707
You can either tell me what happened or I swear

1:29:43.845 --> 1:29:45.613
I'll throw your guts into a basket.

1:29:45.713 --> 1:29:47.115
I swear, Mr. Hernán, I swear.

1:29:47.215 --> 1:29:49.417
I haven't done anything. I don't know anything.

1:29:49.751 --> 1:29:52.086
-I don't know anything about your sister. -Tell me.

1:29:52.186 --> 1:29:53.721
Please.

1:29:55.123 --> 1:29:57.225
You have to believe me, please.

1:30:04.098 --> 1:30:06.868
Please. No, no, no!

1:30:11.272 --> 1:30:13.708
Hernán! Hernán!

1:30:13.775 --> 1:30:17.745
I swear on my mother I don't know anything, please.

1:30:19.547 --> 1:30:20.815
Hernán!

1:30:21.416 --> 1:30:22.984
-No, no, no! Please... -No!

1:30:27.922 --> 1:30:28.923
Tell me now.

1:30:28.990 --> 1:30:31.926
I swear, I swear to God.

1:30:31.993 --> 1:30:33.494
Hernán!

1:30:37.131 --> 1:30:38.966
-Go away, Gonzalo. -What are you doing?

1:30:39.400 --> 1:30:41.235
Go away!

1:30:42.804 --> 1:30:44.105
Leave!

1:30:48.342 --> 1:30:49.977
What are you doing?

1:30:51.779 --> 1:30:54.415
He's responsible for Adela's death.

1:30:54.482 --> 1:30:56.350
Go away, Gonzalo, go away!

1:30:58.119 --> 1:30:59.487
-Leave! -No!

1:30:59.587 --> 1:31:00.788
-Leave! -No!

1:31:01.322 --> 1:31:04.025
Go away, Gonzalo, go away!

1:31:04.125 --> 1:31:07.128
Leave!

1:31:09.964 --> 1:31:11.098
Please leave!

1:31:12.166 --> 1:31:13.868
Get out of here, I'll kill him!

1:31:15.336 --> 1:31:19.006
Go away, Gonzalo! He killed her!

1:31:21.476 --> 1:31:23.644
He killed her!

1:31:27.381 --> 1:31:28.850
No, no, no!

1:31:34.222 --> 1:31:37.124
Please, Mr. Hernán, please, I haven't done anything, I swear,

1:31:37.191 --> 1:31:39.460
I swear, I swear, please.

1:31:40.628 --> 1:31:43.164
I loved her too. Please.

1:31:43.564 --> 1:31:47.034
If I see you on this land again I'll kill you.

1:31:48.169 --> 1:31:50.872
Tell anyone about this and I'll kill you.

1:31:51.739 --> 1:31:53.207
Now get out of here.

1:31:54.542 --> 1:31:56.711
No! Leave!

1:32:12.660 --> 1:32:15.363
Your father planned several buildings here.

1:32:15.429 --> 1:32:18.733
These in particular were designed as social housing.

1:32:19.534 --> 1:32:22.937
It was a groundbreaking project, profiting from the benefits of concrete

1:32:23.037 --> 1:32:24.672
and its possibilities.

1:32:28.943 --> 1:32:30.845
With one special feature.

1:32:30.912 --> 1:32:33.247
Imagine a tower in the middle.

1:32:36.384 --> 1:32:38.586
How would it be different from a prison?

1:32:38.920 --> 1:32:40.588
What do you mean?

1:32:40.688 --> 1:32:44.225
These homes were created as a self-sufficient community

1:32:44.292 --> 1:32:46.460
that could cover all basic needs.

1:32:47.228 --> 1:32:52.466
Big houses, spacious living rooms, perfectly equipped rooms.

1:32:52.567 --> 1:32:54.235
If you look closely, the lower premises

1:32:54.302 --> 1:32:57.705
were intended for a laundry service and a grocery store.

1:32:58.739 --> 1:33:01.576
A forklift service was even installed,

1:33:01.642 --> 1:33:03.544
to avoid having to go outside.

1:33:04.245 --> 1:33:06.047
Your father...

1:33:07.582 --> 1:33:11.052
went through a stage where he was obsessed with being protected.

1:33:11.452 --> 1:33:14.455
-They're enclosed balconies, not windows. -Exactly.

1:33:15.423 --> 1:33:19.794
Closed, hermetic, consistent with his idea.

1:33:19.894 --> 1:33:23.798
Sometimes it's hard to understand the motivations or maybe it's simply

1:33:23.898 --> 1:33:26.467
a matter of practicality.

1:33:26.567 --> 1:33:28.736
But in Gonzalo Medina's case I don't think so.

1:33:28.803 --> 1:33:30.972
-Your father... -How do you know? That's very subjective.

1:33:33.774 --> 1:33:35.576
I worked with Gonzalo.

1:33:35.643 --> 1:33:36.677
What?

1:33:37.078 --> 1:33:38.446
In Alicante.

1:33:39.246 --> 1:33:43.351
During my first professional years we shared influences

1:33:43.451 --> 1:33:44.619
and concerns.

1:33:46.821 --> 1:33:49.190
There's very little information regarding his work.

1:33:55.262 --> 1:33:58.332
They used to keep everything, I guess they could still be there.

1:33:59.333 --> 1:34:01.002
Let's go.

1:34:22.056 --> 1:34:24.492
ADELA VINEYARD

1:35:45.306 --> 1:35:47.441
ADELA, SEPTEMBER 1958

1:37:22.837 --> 1:37:24.371
That cough, son.

1:37:25.840 --> 1:37:28.175
You have a bit of a cold, don't you?

1:37:28.242 --> 1:37:29.977
It's more than a cold, Mercedes.

1:37:30.744 --> 1:37:33.414
Why did you had to get sick now, dear?

1:37:40.154 --> 1:37:43.824
Hey, that boy, the architect,

1:37:43.891 --> 1:37:44.892
did he leave already?

1:37:46.227 --> 1:37:47.661
Tomorrow.

1:37:48.395 --> 1:37:50.865
It was a good idea to bring the wedding forward a few days, huh?

1:37:51.999 --> 1:37:54.535
It was Hernán's idea, he didn't ask me.

1:37:54.602 --> 1:37:56.904
Well, that's not important anymore. You have to respect him,

1:37:57.004 --> 1:37:59.573
because you're going to be very happy together.

1:37:59.673 --> 1:38:01.842
-Can I get you something else? -No.

1:38:06.413 --> 1:38:07.882
Lucía, come.

1:38:41.715 --> 1:38:43.384
Here.

1:38:43.450 --> 1:38:45.552
What are you doing, father?

1:38:45.619 --> 1:38:47.288
This is for you.

1:38:47.388 --> 1:38:48.789
But it's your pendulum.

1:38:48.889 --> 1:38:51.058
Yes, but now it's yours.

1:38:53.894 --> 1:38:57.398
It never failed me.

1:38:58.732 --> 1:39:03.570
I hope it never fails you either.

1:40:17.011 --> 1:40:18.212
Let's go.

1:40:19.013 --> 1:40:21.749
Let's go far away, you and me.

1:40:42.202 --> 1:40:43.737
I'll find a car.

1:40:48.175 --> 1:40:49.209
I love you.

1:40:55.916 --> 1:40:58.419
You should leave. See you at the wine cellar in an hour.

1:41:40.561 --> 1:41:44.731
Hernán, I'm so sorry things had to happen this way.

1:41:44.798 --> 1:41:45.899
Life is surprising sometimes.

1:41:47.267 --> 1:41:49.770
I know any explanation I might attempt will be useless.

1:41:50.170 --> 1:41:52.239
I wish I could control my feelings,

1:41:53.107 --> 1:41:56.477
I wish I could love someone that isn't Lucía, but I can't.

1:41:57.678 --> 1:42:00.114
I don't think I'll ever be able to make up for this damage,

1:42:00.180 --> 1:42:02.149
I understand if you refuse to forgive me.

1:42:02.249 --> 1:42:04.818
I only hope someday you'll at least understand why.

1:42:04.918 --> 1:42:06.186
I'm sorry.

1:42:06.286 --> 1:42:08.589
As for Adela, I should've had the courage to tell you,

1:42:08.922 --> 1:42:10.524
even if it hadn't changed anything.

1:42:10.624 --> 1:42:12.459
God knows it was an accident.

1:42:13.627 --> 1:42:15.963
The night she died, Lucía and I were together.

1:42:16.029 --> 1:42:18.031
She surprised us, got frightened and ran off.

1:42:18.832 --> 1:42:20.300
Curro had nothing to do with it.

1:42:21.201 --> 1:42:23.837
It was an accident, a terrible accident.

1:42:24.838 --> 1:42:26.006
You should know.

1:42:26.473 --> 1:42:27.508
I want you to know.

1:42:28.609 --> 1:42:30.010
I needed to tell you.

1:42:41.622 --> 1:42:42.456
Romeo!

1:42:43.657 --> 1:42:44.525
Romeo!

1:42:45.626 --> 1:42:47.394
What's up, boss?

1:42:47.494 --> 1:42:49.229
-I need your car. -What for?

1:42:49.329 --> 1:42:51.798
I can't say. Take this.

1:42:51.865 --> 1:42:53.800
No, no need, no need.

1:42:53.867 --> 1:42:55.369
-Are you sure? -Yes.

1:42:55.469 --> 1:42:57.638
-Thank you, Romeo. -Good luck to you both.

1:43:28.902 --> 1:43:30.204
What did you do, Hernán?

1:43:31.572 --> 1:43:32.906
What did you do?

1:43:35.409 --> 1:43:36.910
Lucía's inside!

1:43:53.560 --> 1:43:55.362
Lucía!

1:43:55.429 --> 1:43:57.030
Lucía!

1:43:57.764 --> 1:43:58.899
Lucía!

1:44:00.200 --> 1:44:01.401
Lucía!

1:44:02.636 --> 1:44:04.271
Lucía!

1:44:18.218 --> 1:44:19.620
Lucía!

1:44:21.588 --> 1:44:24.758
Lucía! Lucía!

1:45:39.299 --> 1:45:40.867
Leave right now.

1:45:40.967 --> 1:45:42.736
And Lucía, where is she?

1:45:43.870 --> 1:45:44.805
Dead.

1:45:46.807 --> 1:45:47.908
Leave.

1:45:48.008 --> 1:45:49.576
Your name is cursed here.

1:45:49.676 --> 1:45:51.645
They'll kill you if you return.

1:45:52.145 --> 1:45:54.381
I promised Hernán I'd let you go in one piece,

1:45:55.549 --> 1:45:57.417
you owe him your life, ok?

1:45:57.884 --> 1:46:00.187
If it had been up to me...

1:46:00.253 --> 1:46:02.189
I wouldn't have forgiven you.

1:46:04.524 --> 1:46:05.926
Over my dead body.

1:46:12.999 --> 1:46:15.102
He said something else too.

1:46:16.336 --> 1:46:20.507
That the worse punishment is to live with this sorrow until you die.

1:46:46.233 --> 1:46:48.969
That's all we have on Gonzalo Medina.

1:46:49.870 --> 1:46:51.772
Why are you interested, if no one knows who he is?

1:46:52.572 --> 1:46:54.474
I'm doing an item on his work.

1:46:56.643 --> 1:46:58.145
IBAÑEZ VEGA WINERY

1:46:58.245 --> 1:46:59.413
"Jerez de la Frontera."

1:46:59.780 --> 1:47:02.449
There's where he began, his first great work was a winery.

1:47:02.549 --> 1:47:04.618
Athough later is was burnt and only the designs are left.

1:47:42.856 --> 1:47:44.357
Look.

1:47:45.158 --> 1:47:47.828
The names of the dead in the '58 fire.

1:47:56.002 --> 1:47:57.604
¿Gonzalo Medina?

1:47:58.004 --> 1:48:00.707
What's my father's name doing there?

1:48:09.282 --> 1:48:12.285
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1:48:12.352 --> 1:48:15.355
If it's about the guided tours you can ask at reception.

1:48:15.455 --> 1:48:17.157
No, we want to talk with the winery's owners.

1:48:17.224 --> 1:48:19.960
The owner... The lady doesn't live here anymore.

1:48:20.026 --> 1:48:22.529
She moved to the house she has in the vineyard years ago.

1:48:44.885 --> 1:48:45.919
Hello?

1:48:47.687 --> 1:48:48.555
Hello!

1:48:52.025 --> 1:48:53.159
Hello!

1:48:59.199 --> 1:49:00.500
Hello.

1:49:02.702 --> 1:49:04.237
Have we met?

1:49:06.540 --> 1:49:08.375
Are you Lucía Vega?

1:49:08.441 --> 1:49:10.043
Who's asking?

1:49:12.078 --> 1:49:13.747
My name is Isabel Guirao.

1:49:15.615 --> 1:49:16.716
He's Carlos.

1:49:18.351 --> 1:49:19.753
Carlos Medina.

1:49:22.556 --> 1:49:24.624
Gonzalo Medina's son.

1:49:29.296 --> 1:49:31.898
The son of Gonzalo Medina?

1:50:04.097 --> 1:50:05.999
Lucía.

1:50:06.967 --> 1:50:08.101
Dear Lucía.

1:50:08.168 --> 1:50:10.470
40 years have gone by since our lives crossed paths...

1:50:10.570 --> 1:50:11.738
We were like a big family

1:50:11.805 --> 1:50:12.906
...and you still keep showing up in my dreams.

1:50:12.973 --> 1:50:14.074
...and there you were...

1:50:14.140 --> 1:50:16.343
I'm still stuck in that summer of 1958.

1:50:16.443 --> 1:50:18.144
To hear your laugh again...

1:50:21.414 --> 1:50:24.150
-My father didn't die in the fire. -What happened?

1:50:26.119 --> 1:50:28.021
How were we to know what was going to happen?

1:50:33.259 --> 1:50:36.630
How can you be so shameless? Where were you?

1:50:37.664 --> 1:50:39.366
Where's father?

1:50:39.466 --> 1:50:41.868
Lucía, you're not leaving with that miserable man.

1:50:41.968 --> 1:50:43.503
Where's father?

1:50:43.603 --> 1:50:45.705
You have a commitment with Hernán.

1:50:45.805 --> 1:50:48.475
I don't have any commitment, the family has it.

1:50:48.541 --> 1:50:52.045
Lucía, don't throw it all away at the last minute.

1:50:52.145 --> 1:50:53.113
Where's father?

1:50:55.515 --> 1:50:57.717
-Lucía. -Father!

1:50:57.817 --> 1:50:59.052
Lucía, listen to me.

1:50:59.152 --> 1:51:00.120
Father!

1:51:01.888 --> 1:51:02.856
Father!

1:51:07.227 --> 1:51:08.328
No, no, no!

1:51:08.828 --> 1:51:11.064
No! No!

1:51:11.665 --> 1:51:13.366
No, no, no!

1:51:14.968 --> 1:51:17.671
Open up! Open up!

1:51:18.338 --> 1:51:19.406
Open the door, please.

1:51:19.506 --> 1:51:21.641
Open the door, please!

1:51:21.708 --> 1:51:24.511
Open the door, please!

1:51:25.178 --> 1:51:26.012
Please!

1:51:27.914 --> 1:51:29.983
Open the door, please!

1:51:30.383 --> 1:51:32.886
I'm doing it for your sake, Lucía.

1:51:32.986 --> 1:51:35.255
Open the door...!

1:51:35.355 --> 1:51:37.724
You'll thank me someday.

1:51:47.100 --> 1:51:50.103
They told me Gonzalo had died in the wine cellar's fire

1:51:51.738 --> 1:51:52.906
and I believe them.

1:51:53.573 --> 1:51:54.541
They lied to me.

1:51:58.078 --> 1:51:59.846
And what happened with Hernán?

1:52:02.582 --> 1:52:05.552
We got married. He was a good husband.

1:52:06.453 --> 1:52:09.723
He never mentioned Gonzalo, ever.

1:52:10.190 --> 1:52:13.059
He rebuilt the wine cellar but things weren't the same ever again,

1:52:13.126 --> 1:52:14.928
we didn't even have children.

1:52:18.565 --> 1:52:20.633
I tried.

1:52:20.734 --> 1:52:25.071
God knows I tried to be happy, but I never really got there.

1:52:25.138 --> 1:52:27.040
If laughter broke out,

1:52:27.107 --> 1:52:30.076
it was instantly fogged with a difficult memory.

1:52:32.112 --> 1:52:35.749
Those days always came back to my mind.

1:52:43.089 --> 1:52:45.658
Your father was the love of my life

1:52:45.759 --> 1:52:47.994
even if I lived it with another person.

1:52:54.501 --> 1:52:55.468
I have to go.

1:52:55.568 --> 1:52:58.571
Now that we have all the information I want to focus on finishing the novel.

1:52:58.638 --> 1:53:00.974
-I'm not selling the house. -And what about Madrid?

1:53:05.845 --> 1:53:07.280
And you?

1:53:09.916 --> 1:53:12.452
Do you know how the novel ends?

1:53:21.027 --> 1:53:22.328
Answer it.

1:53:24.030 --> 1:53:25.965
Don't make her wait.

1:54:34.534 --> 1:54:37.370
Whenever you want to return you know where to find us.

1:54:40.373 --> 1:54:41.708
Thanks for everything.

1:54:41.774 --> 1:54:43.710
No, no. Don't thank me.

1:54:43.776 --> 1:54:46.379
I want a signed copy.

1:55:02.228 --> 1:55:03.897
You didn't answer my question.

1:55:05.231 --> 1:55:07.567
Do you know how it ends?

1:55:09.903 --> 1:55:11.070
Not yet.

1:55:15.208 --> 1:55:16.576
Why?

1:55:19.946 --> 1:55:22.415
Because the ending I want would never work.

1:55:25.485 --> 1:55:26.786
Are you sure?

1:55:31.925 --> 1:55:33.159
THE SUMMER WE LIVED

1:56:06.960 --> 1:56:09.595
When the sun sets between the Atlantic and the Cantabric,

1:56:10.196 --> 1:56:11.931
and the tide separates me from the land,

1:56:13.433 --> 1:56:15.268
wait for me on the stone porch.

1:56:18.671 --> 1:56:20.039
Time.

1:56:23.876 --> 1:56:25.545
Time

1:56:27.347 --> 1:56:29.682
rules no more

1:56:31.150 --> 1:56:33.686
in you or in me.

1:56:36.889 --> 1:56:38.524
Time

1:56:39.892 --> 1:56:42.362
rules no more.

1:56:49.068 --> 1:56:53.306
Bind me to your eyes,

1:56:54.040 --> 1:56:56.209
let me look at you,

1:56:58.144 --> 1:57:02.315
you appear from out of the blue.

1:57:05.051 --> 1:57:08.855
Bind me to your life,

1:57:09.555 --> 1:57:13.092
leave the dances behind.

1:57:13.826 --> 1:57:16.596
Give me your word

1:57:18.264 --> 1:57:20.867
before you leave.

1:57:36.015 --> 1:57:38.851
Before you leave

1:57:40.053 --> 1:57:43.056
close up my wound.

1:57:44.390 --> 1:57:46.893
I have the promise

1:57:46.959 --> 1:57:49.896
of we two.

1:57:51.697 --> 1:57:54.867
I cannot see your look

1:57:55.902 --> 1:57:58.871
of the land I left

1:57:58.938 --> 1:58:01.741
and the sun,

1:58:03.543 --> 1:58:05.778
but I can see you.

1:58:08.714 --> 1:58:12.118
Bind me to your eyes,

1:58:13.820 --> 1:58:15.788
let me look at you,

1:58:17.423 --> 1:58:21.260
you appear from out of the blue.

1:58:25.264 --> 1:58:29.335
Bind me to your life,

1:58:30.103 --> 1:58:33.239
leave the dances behind.

1:58:34.440 --> 1:58:36.609
Give me your word

1:58:38.344 --> 1:58:40.613
before you leave.

1:58:59.098 --> 1:59:03.169
Bind me to your life.

1:59:07.974 --> 1:59:10.476
Give me your word.

1:59:15.448 --> 1:59:19.185
Bind me to your eyes.

1:59:50.850 --> 1:59:52.418
