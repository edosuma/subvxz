told me when I was a kid

00:48.496 --> 00:50.809
he could listen to the
coyotes howling at night.

00:52.052 --> 00:54.261
He could see the herd
of buffaloes pass by.

00:55.607 --> 00:58.299
He was taught that the
gods were the thunder,

00:58.299 --> 01:00.198
the sun and the rain.

01:02.407 --> 01:05.340

01:06.859 --> 01:09.241
But when the white men arrived,

01:09.241 --> 01:10.932
this became a disaster.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.936
My mother was a
Chiricaguan Indian

01:14.936 --> 01:17.456
and that's where my
nickname came from.

01:17.456 --> 01:18.354
Chiricahua.

01:19.493 --> 01:22.047
My dad was a missionary
who came to Santa Fe

01:22.047 --> 01:23.013
in New Mexico

of knocking up the
Chief's daughter, my mom.

long turn him into a martyr.

01:55.736 --> 02:00.085
I get them some things, like

- How many did you get?

04:22.952 --> 04:24.540
- Not too much.

04:24.540 --> 04:27.474
Most of the cowboys
are heading west, boss.

04:27.474 --> 04:29.510
They say here's a lot
of gold over there.

04:30.649 --> 04:32.789

we're gonna have to go

be in Kansas this month.

04:38.416 --> 04:40.418

There's a lot of cow
snatchers over there.

04:42.730 --> 04:44.939

you with us, Chiricahua.

There is already someone

because of the death

12:35.030 --> 12:36.859
of my compadre, Laureano.

12:36.859 --> 12:38.033
- Man, I know.

12:38.930 --> 12:40.863
It was a terrible thing.

12:40.863 --> 12:42.520
- Do you know something?

12:42.520 --> 12:44.694
Who could have done it and why?

12:44.694 --> 12:46.696
- Nothing, Don Joaquin.

12:46.696 --> 12:48.837
Maybe it was a robbery.

12:48.837 --> 12:51.771
- Laureano was very appreciated
all over the county.

12:51.771 --> 12:52.668
Everyone loved him

12:53.876 --> 12:56.396

it wasn't for stealing,

12:56.396 --> 12:58.605
at least by no on from here.

12:58.605 --> 13:00.469

13:00.469 --> 13:01.711
and by the way they did it,

13:01.711 --> 13:04.887
I'm sure there were many
of them, not just one.

13:06.130 --> 13:07.062
- May I?

13:07.062 --> 13:08.270
I have something to say.

13:09.719 --> 13:12.377
The day they brought Don
Laureano's body back,

13:12.377 --> 13:14.586
I saw something,
something strange.

13:15.760 --> 13:17.900
His boots and his
clothes were muddy.

13:19.074 --> 13:21.490
There has been no
rain these days.

13:21.490 --> 13:23.492
What was Don Laureano
doing in the mud?

13:24.873 --> 13:28.117
I think someone was chasing,
chasing him in the mud.

13:28.117 --> 13:30.050
Something else I noticed.

13:30.050 --> 13:32.363
He had a stain on his
brand new white shirt

13:32.363 --> 13:34.814
but it was different
from the others.

13:34.814 --> 13:38.714
It was like a coffee stain
but it wasn't coffee.

13:38.714 --> 13:40.267
It was tobacco.

13:40.267 --> 13:42.822
Don Laureano didn't
use chewing tobacco.

13:56.180 --> 13:57.043
- Jacinto, right?

13:57.043 --> 13:58.389
- You remember me.

13:58.389 --> 13:59.286
Do you live nearby?

14:00.287 --> 14:01.841
- Yes, behind those hills.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.189
And you?

14:05.189 --> 14:07.018
- Over there, on that side.

14:07.018 --> 14:08.261
Can I ride with you?

14:08.261 --> 14:09.089
- Of course.

14:10.194 --> 14:11.298
- Even though you're
from New York,

14:11.298 --> 14:13.093
you don't ride that badly.

14:13.093 --> 14:17.580
- And you, despite being
Mexican, you're very civilized.

14:17.580 --> 14:18.512
- Excuse me?

14:18.512 --> 14:20.445
What do you mean, "civilized?"

14:20.445 --> 14:21.826
How do you see us in New York?

14:21.826 --> 14:24.415
- I'm sorry, that was very rude.

14:24.415 --> 14:27.349
But there, the idea of
Mexican is a rustler,

14:27.349 --> 14:28.902
a bandit, a robber.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.007
I'm sorry, I am.

14:32.181 --> 14:33.631
- I didn't want to tell you

14:33.631 --> 14:36.530
but the reason I approached
you was just for that,

14:36.530 --> 14:37.773
to get you!

14:37.773 --> 14:38.705
- Oh yeah?

14:38.705 --> 14:40.672
But you must catch me first.

14:40.672 --> 14:42.571

15:21.230 --> 15:22.922
Father was looking for you.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.751
- Just went out for
a ride, brother.

15:25.890 --> 15:27.478
- Who is he?

15:27.478 --> 15:28.306

done this to him?

going to pay for it.

not to shoot people
for no reason?!

in the wild, wild west

of yours I shot,

17:59.837 --> 18:03.047

Indian and a Mexican bitch,

tried to kill us.

- That's right, Dad.

18:08.811 --> 18:10.089
We didn't do nothing'.

- Just like her mother.

And you two, pair of leaches.

Your sister was right.

I won't allow anymore

- Ellie?

Who's Ellie?

19:13.255 --> 19:14.843
- She's a friend I met in town.

19:16.120 --> 19:18.018
We had to stop.

19:18.018 --> 19:21.643
Some guys were blocking
the middle of the road.

19:21.643 --> 19:23.541
They were her brothers.

That's all I remember.

- But why did they shoot you?

19:32.378 --> 19:33.793

Maybe they were confused.

You surely have a problem,
that's why you came down here.

You know why we came here.

getting in our way.

Victoria have reunited.

They will create a tribes union.

look for the smuggler.

Do you have cash?

miners in California.

Charles McKenzie.

I'm real sorry what
happened to your husband.

21:26.733 --> 21:30.668
I'm sure he was a great
man and a loving father.

21:32.256 --> 21:33.740
- Thank you, Mr. McKenzie.

21:36.053 --> 21:39.332
Are you the person interested
in buying the ranch?

21:39.332 --> 21:40.851
- Indeed, ma'am.

21:40.851 --> 21:44.337
You husband and I, we had
a conversation about it.

21:44.337 --> 21:47.306
Unfortunately, we had
a disagreement on it.

21:50.516 --> 21:52.207
- Will you please come in?

21:52.207 --> 21:53.070
- Indeed, ma'am.

21:58.455 --> 22:00.249
- Something to drink, sir?

- Thank you, ma'am,
but I'm fine.

22:04.219 --> 22:05.324
I wonder if your
husband told you

22:05.324 --> 22:07.326
something about the proposal.

22:08.430 --> 22:10.432
We talked about it a
full afternoon, we did.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.952
- He told me something about it.

22:17.508 --> 22:19.199
But tell me, Mr. McKenzie,

22:21.340 --> 22:24.446
why are you so interested
in buying the ranch?

22:25.654 --> 22:27.725
- We have a very big
company, all right?

22:29.451 --> 22:32.178
The headquarters
are in New York City

22:32.178 --> 22:35.146

Texas to the U.S.,

22:41.290 --> 22:43.534
well that gives
us opportunities.

22:43.534 --> 22:47.814
We wanna join the Pacific with
the Atlantic by the railroad.

22:48.884 --> 22:51.093
Does any of this make any sense?

22:51.093 --> 22:52.957
This zone is very
important to us

22:55.097 --> 22:57.790

not the only property

23:34.930 --> 23:36.967
We made a good proposal.

23:36.967 --> 23:40.211
Your daughters and you
could move to a better

23:40.211 --> 23:42.421
and more peaceful place.

23:43.560 --> 23:46.217
I'm talking about the
rest of your lives.

it, Mr. McKenzie.

Please!

26:29.277 --> 26:31.659
I'm really sorry about what
happened with my brothers.

26:32.798 --> 26:35.041
It was a misunderstanding.

26:35.041 --> 26:37.699
They didn't want to do it, so--

26:37.699 --> 26:38.769
- Relax, it's okay.

26:39.908 --> 26:41.841
Fortunately, your
brother is a bad shot.

26:46.501 --> 26:49.297
Besides, being from New York,
you don't ride that badly.

- Jacinto has company.

27:05.900 --> 27:07.936
- Company from who?

27:07.936 --> 27:09.248
- From a girlfriend.

27:09.248 --> 27:10.801
- Girlfriend?

27:10.801 --> 27:13.666
Jacinto doesn't
have a girlfriend.

27:13.666 --> 27:15.116
- Yes he does.

27:15.116 --> 27:16.013
Her name is Ellie.

27:17.566 --> 27:18.740
And she brought cookies.

want you to stay here alone.

27:28.198 --> 27:30.131
- Why are we going
to town, Mama?

27:30.131 --> 27:32.478
- Your father left
unfinished business

27:32.478 --> 27:34.963
and I have to send a
telegram to Chicago.

27:35.964 --> 27:36.793

27:46.595 --> 27:48.667
We hate this place, Mama.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.807

27:50.807 --> 27:53.706
- I feel like everybody hates
us just because we're Mexican.

27:53.706 --> 27:55.190
- That's true.

Now some workers believe
that they're the bosses now.

27:57.745 --> 27:59.263
I don't know why that is.

27:59.263 --> 28:01.921
- One worker told me, "Now
that you live in my country,

28:01.921 --> 28:04.268
"you do it this way now."

28:04.268 --> 28:05.718
- Don't worry.

28:05.718 --> 28:07.616
You will get used to it.

28:07.616 --> 28:09.653
- I wanna live somewhere else.

28:09.653 --> 28:11.310
- But where?

28:11.310 --> 28:12.691
- I don't know where.

28:12.691 --> 28:13.830
Like Boston,

28:13.830 --> 28:16.280
Philadelphia, somewhere
with more people.

28:16.280 --> 28:19.283
Here, this is what
I wanna dedicate to.

Fashion designer, right here.

28:21.665 --> 28:23.702
This is what I want to do.

28:23.702 --> 28:28.154

28:30.674 --> 28:31.951

28:31.951 --> 28:33.401
What do you want to do?

28:33.401 --> 28:36.093
- Me, I want to marry
a rich millionaire.

28:36.093 --> 28:38.061

is what you want.

28:41.927 --> 28:43.929
We're moving to the east.

28:43.929 --> 28:47.518
We're going to sell everything
and start a whole new life.

28:47.518 --> 28:48.796
- Uh huh.

28:48.796 --> 28:51.039
- There I will meet
my prince charming.

29:12.958 --> 29:15.374
- We will have to have
a farewell party for us.

29:15.374 --> 29:17.548
- We will invite the whole town.

29:18.860 --> 29:21.518
- We are still in mourning,
dears, don't forget.

we're going to catch them.

35:04.481 --> 35:06.000

35:06.000 --> 35:09.555
there were four or five
Indians who attacked them.

35:09.555 --> 35:11.661
This happened just
after leaving the ranch

35:11.661 --> 35:13.559
on their way to town.

35:13.559 --> 35:15.251
- They must be near.

35:15.251 --> 35:16.183
Let's go find them
and hang them.

35:16.183 --> 35:17.460
Ain't that what we're here for?

35:17.460 --> 35:18.599
- I'm sure they're
trying to escape

35:18.599 --> 35:20.118
through the mountain range.

35:20.118 --> 35:24.156
I need volunteers to go up

35:44.625 --> 35:46.972
- Don't you think all
this is very strange?

35:48.525 --> 35:51.045
Indians have never
attacked our women before.

35:53.185 --> 35:55.463
They have always
respected the agreement.

35:55.463 --> 35:58.225
- But now the Indians
are really pissed off.

35:58.225 --> 36:00.054
The whites are
stealing their lands.

36:00.917 --> 36:02.436
You think it's Chiricahua?

36:49.310 --> 36:52.244
- Chiricahua, what're
you doing here?

36:52.244 --> 36:54.729
- What did you do after
I saw you yesterday?

36:54.729 --> 36:56.144
- What are you talking about?

36:56.144 --> 36:57.353
We were with the buyers.

36:57.353 --> 37:00.045
We sold them a lot
of quality furs.

37:00.045 --> 37:01.011
What is it?

37:01.011 --> 37:02.220
- They're coming for you.

37:03.497 --> 37:05.257
- Why are they coming for us?

37:05.257 --> 37:07.294
- Three white women
were raped yesterday.

37:07.294 --> 37:09.330
They say they were Indians.

37:09.330 --> 37:11.919
And there are no more
Indians around here but you.

You better get the hell

37:24.656 --> 37:25.795
I'll go talk with them.

37:37.082 --> 37:39.671
- Chiricahua, what the
fuck are you doing here?

37:39.671 --> 37:41.362
- He done told them that
we were coming from him.

37:41.362 --> 37:43.606
Just remember,
he's an Indian too.

37:43.606 --> 37:44.883

They didn't do it!

37:44.883 --> 37:46.125
- And how the fuck
do you know that?

37:46.125 --> 37:47.920
- Because they were
with me yesterday.

37:47.920 --> 37:50.716

could've been with them

He always will be.

37:58.931 --> 38:01.244
- [Ramon] You tell
them to give up.

38:01.244 --> 38:03.936
- Only if you give them your
word you won't hurt them.

How can you be so
sure that they did it?

they were attacked.

No scandals.

Okay.

40:25.837 --> 40:28.943
Everything's gonna be
perfect, little brother.

40:28.943 --> 40:32.395
As soon as they lock up
those Indians, it's all over.

40:32.395 --> 40:33.223
- That's right.

40:34.052 --> 40:35.536
It gets even better.

40:35.536 --> 40:37.607
I heard they won't
even wait for a trial.

They'll hang 'em before that.

after this, the widow
will surely sell.

I'd like to give another

Indians and imprisoned them.

41:04.669 --> 41:06.222
The people want to lynch them.

41:22.410 --> 41:26.518
in particular with
the Iturralde family,

it's because we have strayed
from the path of God.

Those Indians

really are

41:43.984 --> 41:44.881

41:46.055 --> 41:50.956
It's Satan using
them as instruments

41:51.750 --> 41:53.407
and the only way

41:55.029 --> 41:57.238
to free this family
from the curse

41:58.136 --> 42:01.726
is to get closer to the church.

make the church greater

44:06.091 --> 44:08.611
- All the horses on the
scene had horse shoes.

44:08.611 --> 44:10.820
No Indian rides a
horse with horse shoes.

44:10.820 --> 44:13.167
They only ride wild
horses, no saddle,

44:13.167 --> 44:14.582
bare hooves.

44:14.582 --> 44:15.411
- Follow me.

44:17.965 --> 44:20.519
Marta, could you see
any of the attackers?

44:20.519 --> 44:21.762
Did you see their faces?

44:23.212 --> 44:24.420
What did they look like?

44:25.835 --> 44:27.388
- No, no.

44:29.114 --> 44:30.806
Everything happened so fast.

44:32.186 --> 44:34.637
And they had their
faces covered.

44:34.637 --> 44:37.536
[foreboding music]

44:55.416 --> 44:58.040
- Marta, they weren't Indians.

44:58.040 --> 44:59.317
- What?

44:59.317 --> 45:00.559
- They weren't Indians.

45:00.559 --> 45:02.113
They were white men
disguised as Indians.

45:02.113 --> 45:05.426
- But how do you know that?

45:05.426 --> 45:07.601
- Chiricahua went back to
the place where it happened

45:07.601 --> 45:10.811
and found tracks that
now we know for sure.

45:10.811 --> 45:12.433
- But if they weren't Indians,

45:12.433 --> 45:14.608
who'd want to do
something like this

45:14.608 --> 45:15.574
and why?!

45:15.574 --> 45:18.232
[ominous music]

45:19.406 --> 45:21.097
- I heard what all
of you were saying.

45:22.271 --> 45:23.617
The Indian that attacked me,

45:23.617 --> 45:26.585
his face was covered
with a cloth.

45:26.585 --> 45:28.173
I could see his eyes.

45:28.173 --> 45:30.313
They were as blue as the sky.

45:30.313 --> 45:31.970
Was he Indian, no!

[menacing music]

46:08.213 --> 46:09.042
Kneel!

46:10.146 --> 46:10.975
Kneel!

46:18.292 --> 46:20.122
- Ramon, what happened here?!

46:20.122 --> 46:21.330
- He took them!

46:21.330 --> 46:22.158
- Where?

46:22.158 --> 46:23.297
- To the Encinos!

46:23.297 --> 46:25.506
- Let's go, Chiricahua!

46:25.506 --> 46:28.164
[ominous music]

47:04.407 --> 47:05.892
- Mm-mmm.

47:05.892 --> 47:08.066
- [gunshot booming]

47:08.066 --> 47:08.964
- Let him down!

47:08.964 --> 47:10.068
Let him down!

[groaning]

47:17.627 --> 47:20.561
[gunshot booming]

47:20.561 --> 47:23.254
- Thank you, half blood,
you saved our lives.

47:24.669 --> 47:26.913
- Don't come back
here right now.

47:26.913 --> 47:28.984
Things are getting
very ugly around here.

48:15.927 --> 48:18.619
[ominous music]

48:21.070 --> 48:24.142
- How could they not hang
those goddamn Indians?

48:24.142 --> 48:25.799
- It was a Chiricahua
that saved them.

48:25.799 --> 48:28.319
- We shoulda killed them
in the store the other day.

48:28.319 --> 48:29.734
- You worthless fools!

48:29.734 --> 48:32.288
You should just be grateful
he didn't kill you.

48:32.288 --> 48:33.600
- He got lucky, Dad.

48:33.600 --> 48:34.428
[laughing]

48:34.428 --> 48:35.705
- Lucky?

48:35.705 --> 48:37.915
- This is one of the
wells we discovered.

48:37.915 --> 48:40.331
We found it last week.

48:40.331 --> 48:42.229
The first one we
found over there,

48:42.229 --> 48:43.886
so if we triangulate,

48:45.336 --> 48:47.579
beneath these spots, we'll
find thousands of barrels.

48:47.579 --> 48:49.823
- We also searched
behind those hills

48:49.823 --> 48:53.585
and the bushes over there look
like the bushes over here,

48:53.585 --> 48:55.380
which means we have
a pretty good chance

48:55.380 --> 48:56.657
of being in the right area.

48:56.657 --> 48:58.901
I think we'll find what
we're looking for here.

48:58.901 --> 49:01.110
- So whose property is that?

49:01.110 --> 49:02.732
- That's the Villarreals.

49:02.732 --> 49:05.839
[ominous beat music]

49:23.201 --> 49:25.445
- [Chiricahua Voiceover] How
odd the Yankees are interested

49:25.445 --> 49:26.756
in this smelly thing.

49:29.345 --> 49:32.210
My ancestors used it
to seal their canoes

49:32.210 --> 49:33.522
and to heal their wounds.

49:34.419 --> 49:36.421
What do they want it for?

[somber plucking tune]

49:48.537 --> 49:50.090
- Ellie?

49:50.090 --> 49:52.955
- Jacinto, what're
you doing here?

49:59.617 --> 50:00.963
How did you get in?

50:00.963 --> 50:01.964
- The door was open.

50:04.311 --> 50:05.140
- Come in.

50:06.175 --> 50:07.935
What are you doing here?

50:07.935 --> 50:09.144
- I'm repaying the visit.

50:10.317 --> 50:11.663
But I didn't bring
you any cookies.

50:11.663 --> 50:12.595
[giggling]

50:12.595 --> 50:13.769
- Don't worry about it.

50:15.322 --> 50:17.014
And how are you?

50:17.014 --> 50:18.187
- Much better.

50:18.187 --> 50:19.878
Only a few more
days to take it off.

50:22.467 --> 50:23.882
- Wow.

50:23.882 --> 50:25.712
What a lovely house.

50:25.712 --> 50:27.093
- Thank you.

50:27.093 --> 50:28.784
It's the furniture
that my mom bought

50:28.784 --> 50:30.372
before she died in New York.

50:32.236 --> 50:34.272
And my dad wanted to
bring them all here.

50:35.446 --> 50:37.206
- Oh, I'm sorry.

50:37.206 --> 50:38.035
- I miss her.

50:41.245 --> 50:43.764
- And what did you do with your
boyfriend back in New York?

50:43.764 --> 50:45.732
- I didn't have a
boyfriend in New York.

50:46.733 --> 50:47.975
- I don't believe that.

50:48.907 --> 50:51.358
A woman as beautiful as you

50:51.358 --> 50:53.981
I imagine had many
suitors pursuing her.

50:55.880 --> 50:57.123
- Maybe.

50:57.123 --> 51:00.057
But I think my brothers
scared them all away.

51:01.092 --> 51:01.920
- Mm-hmm.

51:01.920 --> 51:03.405
Tell me about it.

51:08.617 --> 51:11.309
- You know, I think
that they're protective.

51:11.309 --> 51:13.070
They look after me.

down so early?

you ready to study now?

- Well I...

57:27.961 --> 57:29.273
Well I...

57:29.273 --> 57:30.239
Real soon.

57:30.239 --> 57:31.862
I wanted to ask you something.

57:32.863 --> 57:33.691
- Tell me.

57:34.865 --> 57:36.591
- What's the name
of that black thing

57:36.591 --> 57:39.490
that comes from the grounds
there on our fields?

57:39.490 --> 57:43.218
The one they fix
wagons and canoes with.

57:43.218 --> 57:44.806
- Oil.

57:44.806 --> 57:46.739
Crude oil.

57:46.739 --> 57:47.567
- That's the one.

57:48.603 --> 57:49.431
- Hold on.

57:53.677 --> 57:54.505
Ah, yes.

57:56.714 --> 57:58.060
There's the one.

58:08.761 --> 58:10.038
Read this, please.

58:12.972 --> 58:14.318
- A....

58:14.318 --> 58:15.664
A...

58:15.664 --> 58:16.493
A...

58:17.735 --> 58:20.048
You know very well
that I cannot read.

58:21.394 --> 58:22.360
- And why is that?

58:22.360 --> 58:24.535
- Because I never went to class.

58:26.054 --> 58:28.505
- Well, tell me what
you need to know.

58:28.505 --> 58:31.715
- Why is this oil so valuable
that the Yankees fight?

58:31.715 --> 58:32.923
- Well,

58:32.923 --> 58:37.203
here it says that
"Oil, once distilled,

58:37.203 --> 58:41.621
"creates another type of oil
that can be used as lamp fuel."

58:42.898 --> 58:43.865
Here's something interesting.

58:43.865 --> 58:45.383
"Recently,

58:45.383 --> 58:48.594
"a machine called internal
combustion was invented,

58:49.767 --> 58:54.013
"which will use oil as fuel.

"This invention
will soon replace

machines we know."

My dear Chiri,

59:03.540 --> 59:06.957
these machines will
revolutionize the whole world

59:06.957 --> 59:10.063
and oil will be essential
for this to happen.

What's the news?

59:24.353 --> 59:25.182
Have a seat.

59:28.772 --> 59:31.844
- In the morning I saw
these new neighbors,

59:31.844 --> 59:34.191
the McKenzie's,

59:34.191 --> 59:36.365
got into the Iturraldes' farm.

59:37.228 --> 59:38.713
- The McKenzie's?

59:38.713 --> 59:42.026
The ones who want to buy the
farm from Marta Iturralde?

59:42.026 --> 59:43.234
- That's the one.

59:43.234 --> 59:44.581
- What were they doing there?

59:44.581 --> 59:45.996
- I asked the same question.

59:47.376 --> 59:52.002
And it turns out what they
want from the Iturraldes' farm,

59:53.037 --> 59:54.660
it ain't the
livestock or the land.

59:54.660 --> 59:56.593
It's what comes from the ground.

59:57.455 --> 59:58.905
- What's that?

59:58.905 --> 01:00:02.253
- That black stuff that
kills our grass, our animals

01:00:02.253 --> 01:00:04.601
and poisons the water we drink.

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:05.429
- You mean oil.

01:00:05.429 --> 01:00:06.879
- That's it.

01:00:06.879 --> 01:00:08.328
- How do you know that?

01:00:08.328 --> 01:00:10.158
- Because I followed them.

01:00:10.158 --> 01:00:12.332
I heard them talk about it.

01:00:12.332 --> 01:00:14.749
They were talking
about thousands and
thousands of barrels.

01:00:14.749 --> 01:00:16.474
They were talking about money

01:00:16.474 --> 01:00:18.200
and I learned from the professor

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:21.065

One more thing,

01:00:22.342 --> 01:00:24.828
I'm sure the
McKenzie's are the ones

01:00:24.828 --> 01:00:27.175
who killed Don Laureano
and raped his family,

01:00:27.175 --> 01:00:29.418
his two daughters,
the poor things.

the same thing.

know all the facts.

- [Jacinto] What's up, Dad?

01:00:43.294 --> 01:00:44.261
- Sit down, my son.

01:00:48.506 --> 01:00:51.820
I know you've been seeing
Charles McKenzie's daughter

01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:53.684

stop seeing her.

- But why?

01:00:55.962 --> 01:00:58.275
- Charles McKenzie and his
boys are dangerous people.

01:00:59.483 --> 01:01:01.036
And, remember, they
almost killed you.

01:01:01.036 --> 01:01:03.383

01:01:03.383 --> 01:01:05.523
- They're capable of anything

01:01:05.523 --> 01:01:09.666
and I'm quite certain that
they killed your uncle Laureano

01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:11.046

I am willing to sell
everything to you.

The only thing we want is
for you to leave this town.

For her benefit, of course.

01:04:26.448 --> 01:04:28.347
- It's a shame this
understanding came

01:04:28.347 --> 01:04:31.557
after the death of my
friend, Laureano Iturralde,

01:04:31.557 --> 01:04:35.354

on his wife and daughters.

01:04:43.672 --> 01:04:44.984
This was a quiet town

of settlers arrived

shot by one of your boys.

- That was a terrible
mistake, friend.

They thought they were
protecting their younger sister.

I suggest you keep an
eye on your daughter.

01:05:07.765 --> 01:05:10.561
There's a band of rapists

01:05:40.419 --> 01:05:41.523
what would they
have done with me?

01:05:44.354 --> 01:05:45.769
- Would they have killed me?

01:05:45.769 --> 01:05:46.666

That my family had
to do with that?

don't believe him.

01:10:55.872 --> 01:10:57.632
is gonna take too much cash,

01:10:57.632 --> 01:11:00.117
and most importantly, time.

01:11:00.117 --> 01:11:01.567
- That's right.

01:11:01.567 --> 01:11:03.535
And in this area,

01:11:03.535 --> 01:11:05.330
this is where we
had the oil spring.

01:11:06.917 --> 01:11:08.298
- Mmmmm.

01:11:08.298 --> 01:11:10.231
- Good morning, Don Joaquin.

01:11:10.231 --> 01:11:11.508
- Good morning, Ramon.

01:11:11.508 --> 01:11:13.614
I'm scared of your visits now.

01:11:13.614 --> 01:11:16.306
- Unfortunately, I don't
bring good news, Don Joaquin.

01:11:18.170 --> 01:11:20.310
They found the coach
where Miss Iturralde

01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:22.208
and her daughters
were traveling.

01:11:24.694 --> 01:11:25.626
It was empty.

01:11:27.317 --> 01:11:30.147
It was found 200
miles from here.

01:11:30.147 --> 01:11:31.563
They were headed to Kansas.

01:11:32.874 --> 01:11:34.151
- Yes, I know.

01:11:34.151 --> 01:11:35.394
- I'm here to ask Chiricahua

01:11:35.394 --> 01:11:37.741
if he can help us
find their tracks.

01:11:37.741 --> 01:11:39.295
- Let's go.

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:40.261
- I'll go with you.

01:11:41.193 --> 01:11:43.782
[somber music]

01:12:05.217 --> 01:12:06.322
- They dropped here.

01:12:07.771 --> 01:12:10.981
These boot tracks and some
smaller shoes too, women shoes.

01:12:13.225 --> 01:12:15.400
Oh, the stagecoach was
lighter from here on.

01:12:26.618 --> 01:12:29.345
[dramatic music]

01:12:57.303 --> 01:12:59.444
- Hey, Bill, they
found the women.

01:12:59.444 --> 01:13:00.997
What're we gonna do?

01:13:02.205 --> 01:13:03.620
- Don't worry, Jim.

01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:06.554
Dad is the most
influential man in town.

01:13:06.554 --> 01:13:09.661
Besides, we have the
governor's blessing.

01:13:09.661 --> 01:13:11.317
They can not touch us.

01:13:13.837 --> 01:13:16.115
- But those scratches
on your neck.

01:13:16.115 --> 01:13:18.221
There's no way you did
them with barbwire.

01:13:19.705 --> 01:13:20.844
- Have you seen your wrist?

01:13:23.882 --> 01:13:25.608
This and your wrist,

01:13:25.608 --> 01:13:28.127
it's all because
the whores upstairs.

01:13:28.127 --> 01:13:29.577
We talk to them,

01:13:29.577 --> 01:13:31.890
give them a little bit
of money and it's done.

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:34.099
- If they don't agree?

01:13:37.965 --> 01:13:39.449
- They will agree.

01:13:39.449 --> 01:13:41.693
[laughing]

01:13:44.178 --> 01:13:45.973
- What if our asshole
dad finds out?

01:13:46.939 --> 01:13:48.389
- Dad?

01:13:48.389 --> 01:13:49.528
Are you kidding me?

01:13:49.528 --> 01:13:51.910
He has more to
worry about than us.

01:13:51.910 --> 01:13:53.739
[laughing]

01:13:53.739 --> 01:13:57.087
[pleasant guitar music]

01:14:06.096 --> 01:14:07.753
- Ellie!

01:14:07.753 --> 01:14:09.445
- Jacinto, what're
you doing here?

01:14:09.445 --> 01:14:11.170
- I need to talk to you.
- Over here, come.

01:14:16.279 --> 01:14:18.246
- We need to leave town, Ellie.

01:14:18.246 --> 01:14:19.455
- Why, what're you saying?

01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:20.904
- Things are going to
get dangerous here.

01:14:20.904 --> 01:14:24.183
- I'm going to tell my father
and brothers the truth,

01:14:24.183 --> 01:14:25.184
that I'm pregnant.

01:14:26.082 --> 01:14:27.152
They will understand.

01:14:27.152 --> 01:14:28.567
- You don't get it!

01:14:28.567 --> 01:14:31.328
It's going to get dangerous
between our families.

01:14:31.328 --> 01:14:32.916
Your brothers did
something terrible

01:14:32.916 --> 01:14:34.159
that can get them hanged!

01:14:35.781 --> 01:14:37.956
- What's the matter, Jacinto?

01:14:37.956 --> 01:14:39.336
You're scaring me.

01:14:39.336 --> 01:14:42.167
- Promise me you won't
tell anyone about this.

01:14:42.167 --> 01:14:44.272
You brothers killed
the Iturralde woman,

01:14:44.272 --> 01:14:46.620
the mother and both sisters.

01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:48.656
They raped and murdered them

01:14:48.656 --> 01:14:51.072
and afterwards, they
buried them near here.

01:14:51.072 --> 01:14:54.282
- No, no, that can't be true.

01:14:54.282 --> 01:14:57.044
They're not capable of
doing something like that.

01:14:57.044 --> 01:14:59.529
- Your father ordered the
murder of Don Laureano

01:14:59.529 --> 01:15:02.014
because he refused
to sell his land.

01:15:02.014 --> 01:15:04.223
The widow accepted but
he killed them anyway.

01:15:04.223 --> 01:15:05.397
- No.

01:15:05.397 --> 01:15:06.743
I don't believe
anything that you say.

01:15:06.743 --> 01:15:08.780
- Your brothers
are crazy, Ellie!

01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:10.920
There's been a
whole investigation.

01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:12.438
I was there.

01:15:12.438 --> 01:15:14.648
See if your brothers have
any wounds or scratches

01:15:14.648 --> 01:15:15.649
made by a woman.

01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:19.929
Think about it but we
need to decide quickly.

01:15:21.482 --> 01:15:24.623
[upbeat guitar music]

01:15:35.151 --> 01:15:36.221
- Shot.

01:15:36.221 --> 01:15:37.878
- [Man] Here you go.

01:15:57.345 --> 01:16:00.003
- How you doin', boys?

01:16:00.003 --> 01:16:02.178
[shushing]

01:16:03.766 --> 01:16:04.629
Relax.

01:16:06.492 --> 01:16:09.219
There is a Colt
45 under the table

01:16:09.219 --> 01:16:10.876
aiming straight at your huevos.

01:16:12.706 --> 01:16:14.708
I have a sensitive finger.

01:16:14.708 --> 01:16:16.502
Any movement from the hand

01:16:17.573 --> 01:16:19.851
and the only thing
left for you to scratch

01:16:19.851 --> 01:16:20.679
will be your head

01:16:22.578 --> 01:16:25.201
and the bullet will come
out of your asshole.

01:16:26.892 --> 01:16:28.514
That goes for you too, Jimmy.

01:16:30.655 --> 01:16:33.554
Put your hands on the
table very slowly.

01:16:38.973 --> 01:16:42.252
- You have no idea who
you're messing with, Indian.

01:16:42.252 --> 01:16:43.771
- No.

01:16:43.771 --> 01:16:45.773
I know exactly who
I'm dealing with.

01:16:45.773 --> 01:16:47.637
Some assholes that raped

01:16:47.637 --> 01:16:49.466
and killed three
defenseless women.

01:16:49.466 --> 01:16:51.227
- What you talking about?

01:16:51.227 --> 01:16:53.816
- I wonder what the judge
will think about all this.

01:16:55.058 --> 01:16:58.061
[suspenseful music]

01:16:59.718 --> 01:17:02.583
- Get on your feet and raise
your hands slowly, right now!

01:17:04.033 --> 01:17:06.276
[laughing]

01:17:08.485 --> 01:17:11.005
- You Mexicans
are such pendejos.

01:17:13.318 --> 01:17:16.045
And you, filthy Indian,

01:17:16.045 --> 01:17:19.565
you're a dead man.
[ominous music]

01:17:24.225 --> 01:17:26.607
- Who's the pendejo now?

01:17:26.607 --> 01:17:28.713
- I'm going to kill you!

01:17:28.713 --> 01:17:31.647
[somber guitar music]

01:17:31.647 --> 01:17:34.063
- I want you to release
my two boys immediately!

01:17:35.754 --> 01:17:40.310
- Your boys are detained
for rape and murder

01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:42.140
of the Iturralde women.

01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:44.936
We are waiting for the
judge to start the trial.

01:17:44.936 --> 01:17:48.146
- By the order of Governor
Henderson, himself,

01:17:49.354 --> 01:17:52.806
release my sons or
you'll be replaced

01:17:52.806 --> 01:17:54.980
and sent to Austin for contempt.

01:17:56.810 --> 01:17:59.985
[ominous tempo music]

01:18:28.704 --> 01:18:30.602
- Where's the judge
we were waiting for?

01:18:30.602 --> 01:18:32.293
- They sent him
back, Don Joaquin.

01:18:33.639 --> 01:18:35.572
- The law is in the
hands of the McKenzie's.

01:18:35.572 --> 01:18:36.401
- Mm-hmm.

01:18:37.816 --> 01:18:41.337
- We are unprotected against
that family of murderers.

01:18:41.337 --> 01:18:44.236
- I say we give them some
of their own medicine.

01:18:44.236 --> 01:18:46.583
- We aren't
murderers, Chiricahua.

01:18:46.583 --> 01:18:50.311
- We're not as long as we
are defending ourselves.

01:18:53.073 --> 01:18:54.488
- Now I warned you!

01:18:54.488 --> 01:18:56.386
I don't want anymore bullshit!

01:18:58.078 --> 01:19:01.115
This favor I asked the governor
for is gonna cost me a lot!

01:19:02.185 --> 01:19:03.635
- We didn't do anything, Dad.

01:19:05.533 --> 01:19:08.226
- With so many goddamn
women in this town,

01:19:09.917 --> 01:19:12.644
you go and mess around
with the Iturralde's.

01:19:12.644 --> 01:19:14.577
And to top it off, you
gotta go kill them?!

01:19:14.577 --> 01:19:16.027
- I swear, Dad, we didn't do--

[thudding]
[ominous music]

You think you can fool me now?!

01:19:23.379 --> 01:19:24.760
You are my blood

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:27.038
and I know you are
capable of that and more!

house and get some things.

I'll go get my stuff
and we can leave.

Jacinto is leaving?

Where'd he go?

took his things and ran off.

know, do they?

going to find you

but I also heard that she is...

01:24:51.534 --> 01:24:52.742
She's pregnant.

01:24:52.742 --> 01:24:55.400
[menacing music]
- Damn!

01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:56.229
Get out!

01:25:08.241 --> 01:25:09.828
- Dad, Jacinto is gone.

01:25:09.828 --> 01:25:11.244
- What do you mean,
Jacinto's gone?

01:25:11.244 --> 01:25:13.625
- I'm telling you, he left
with Elle, McKenzie's daughter.

01:25:13.625 --> 01:25:14.868
- What?!

01:25:14.868 --> 01:25:18.078
- Yes, Joaquin, the
girl is pregnant.

01:25:18.078 --> 01:25:20.460
- [Chiricahua Voiceover]
I don't blame Jacinto.

01:25:20.460 --> 01:25:22.393
I would've done the same.

01:25:22.393 --> 01:25:25.672
But not having brothers-in-laws
like the McKenzie's,

01:25:25.672 --> 01:25:29.883
either way, he got Mr.
McKenzie's daughter pregnant.

01:25:29.883 --> 01:25:32.196
Where have I heard
that story before?

01:25:32.196 --> 01:25:33.887
[ominous music]

01:25:33.887 --> 01:25:36.407
- The McKenzie's will
surely go after them

01:25:36.407 --> 01:25:38.340
and they have many
reasons to hurt him.

01:25:39.306 --> 01:25:40.756
We'll go up north.

01:25:40.756 --> 01:25:42.827
We'll catch up with them there.

01:25:42.827 --> 01:25:45.830
- When I was
little, my mom died.

01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:48.833
I went from boarding
school to boarding school.

01:25:48.833 --> 01:25:51.146
That's why I never spent
time with my family.

01:25:52.802 --> 01:25:55.046
I didn't know what kind
of people they were.

01:25:56.461 --> 01:25:57.531
- I got lucky.

01:25:57.531 --> 01:25:58.912
My family is pretty normal.

01:26:00.327 --> 01:26:03.675
- Well, yeah, for Mexicans,
family is very important.

01:26:05.056 --> 01:26:06.471
But not for Saxons.

01:26:06.471 --> 01:26:09.129
For them, money's
more important.

01:26:09.129 --> 01:26:10.303
- You should be Mexican.

01:26:11.994 --> 01:26:14.514
- Well, I have a
little one inside.

01:26:14.514 --> 01:26:15.894
[laughing]

01:26:15.894 --> 01:26:17.275
- The horses are really tired.

01:26:17.275 --> 01:26:18.276
We should rest them.

01:26:19.691 --> 01:26:22.246
Besides, it's getting late,
we should find shelter.

01:26:26.940 --> 01:26:29.667
[pleasant music]

01:26:53.346 --> 01:26:55.486
How did you sleep?

01:26:55.486 --> 01:26:57.142
- Wonderfully.

01:26:57.142 --> 01:26:58.420
- Me too.

01:26:58.420 --> 01:27:01.112
[pleasant music]

01:27:04.357 --> 01:27:07.222
I can't believe
we're doing this,

01:27:07.222 --> 01:27:08.050
together.

01:27:14.436 --> 01:27:15.540
Let's grab our things.

01:27:19.441 --> 01:27:21.719
Honey, let's hurry up.

01:27:21.719 --> 01:27:23.445
It's not long to Austin.

01:27:23.445 --> 01:27:25.101
There, we can get
something to eat.

01:27:25.101 --> 01:27:26.171
- One moment.

01:27:33.765 --> 01:27:35.560
How much did you
get for the horses?

01:27:37.182 --> 01:27:39.115
- Not much, honey,
but with these horses,

01:27:39.115 --> 01:27:40.703
I don't think they'll find us.

01:27:44.466 --> 01:27:47.365
[foreboding music]

01:27:49.436 --> 01:27:50.541
Hey, someone's coming.

01:27:52.163 --> 01:27:53.682
- Who could it be?

01:27:53.682 --> 01:27:56.616
- I don't know but we're not
gonna stay here to find out.

01:27:56.616 --> 01:27:59.308
[eerie music]

01:27:59.308 --> 01:28:02.000

[foreboding music]

01:28:29.959 --> 01:28:32.410
- Jacinto, are you crazy?!

01:28:32.410 --> 01:28:33.480
- Stay away!

01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:35.655
Ellie and I are going north!

01:28:35.655 --> 01:28:37.139
- Damn you, Jacinto!

01:28:37.139 --> 01:28:40.038
[gunshots booming]

01:28:41.039 --> 01:28:41.937
Take cover!

01:28:42.903 --> 01:28:45.906
[suspenseful music]

01:28:59.299 --> 01:29:01.784
- They're coming this way, boss!

01:29:01.784 --> 01:29:03.303
- You two, over there!

01:29:03.303 --> 01:29:04.339
Let's cover the hill!

01:29:05.892 --> 01:29:08.895
[suspenseful music]

01:29:38.821 --> 01:29:41.962
- Hey, Jim, go around me,
catch him from the back.

01:30:05.607 --> 01:30:06.884
I have to help my father.

01:30:07.885 --> 01:30:08.955
Wait for me here.

01:30:52.308 --> 01:30:53.171
- Please!

01:30:53.171 --> 01:30:55.311
Don't, don't shoot me!

01:31:14.572 --> 01:31:16.505

just a flesh wound.

nice to see you again.

01:32:00.031 --> 01:32:02.689
- Ellie, we are very
sorry it ended this way.

01:32:02.689 --> 01:32:03.587
Truly sorry.

01:32:04.726 --> 01:32:07.798
- Well, I'm not because
I have a new family

01:32:07.798 --> 01:32:09.593
and I drink to that.

01:32:09.593 --> 01:32:10.594

- [Chiricahua] Cheers.

01:32:11.456 --> 01:32:12.630
- And a toast,

01:32:12.630 --> 01:32:15.530
for my niece that needs
to be named Juanita,

01:32:15.530 --> 01:32:17.048
like her auntie.

01:32:17.048 --> 01:32:18.533
And if he is a boy,

01:32:18.533 --> 01:32:19.844
call him Juan.

01:32:22.260 --> 01:32:25.160
- And why doesn't
anyone ask the Mama?

01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:27.024
- Well, if it's a girl,

01:32:27.024 --> 01:32:29.716
it'll be Elena, like
my mother-in-law.

01:32:29.716 --> 01:32:30.924
- Than you, Ellie.

01:32:32.063 --> 01:32:35.066

your real name anyway?
