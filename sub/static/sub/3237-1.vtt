00:43.406 --> 00:46.637
<i>I've done terrible things in my life.</i>

00:47.143 --> 00:50.709
<i>Things for which I can never
be forgiven.</i>

00:51.447 --> 00:53.951
<i>I betrayed friends,</i>

00:54.267 --> 00:57.553
<i>turned my back on the ones
closest to me.</i>

00:57.653 --> 00:59.745
<i>Gabriela!</i>

01:00.831 --> 01:04.994
<i>I've always known that my sins
would eventually catch up to me.</i>

01:05.093 --> 01:08.665
<i>No sin goes unpunished in this life.</i>

01:14.171 --> 01:18.408
<i>Your life doesn't flash before your eyes
when you're dying. That's bullshit.</i>

01:19.408 --> 01:22.712
<i>It's your regrets that haunt you
in your final moments.</i>

01:23.447 --> 01:26.429
<i>Everything you failed to be.</i>

01:27.149 --> 01:30.720
- <i>Everyone you let down.</i>
- Run!

01:31.220 --> 01:36.269
<i>Everything you'd go back and change
if only you had more time.</i>

01:43.778 --> 01:46.802
Look who's up. Sleeping beauty.

01:46.902 --> 01:48.738
You were fartin' in your sleep again,
you know that, Conlon?

01:48.838 --> 01:51.235
How would I know that, dickhead?
I was sleepin'.

01:51.335 --> 01:54.080
More like dead to the world.

01:55.212 --> 01:57.980
- Danny in yet?
- In the office.

01:58.080 --> 02:00.108
Here he goes.

02:05.354 --> 02:08.258
And he's chasin' her around the house
with his thing all night.

02:08.358 --> 02:12.496
Finally she goes: "How is titty-fucking me
gonna make my tits any bigger?"

02:12.746 --> 02:17.067
Boyfriend says, "Hey, baby, it beats me,
but it worked on your ass."

02:18.702 --> 02:21.071
All right, there you go.
Merry Christmas.

02:21.171 --> 02:23.806
- I appreciate that, Danny.
- Thank you.

02:23.936 --> 02:26.410
All right, get outta here.
Shit, shower and shave time for me.

02:26.510 --> 02:29.079
Hot date tonight?
Little grab-ass under the mistletoe?

02:29.179 --> 02:31.934
I wish. I'm introducin' my father

02:32.034 --> 02:33.494
- to some new business partners.
- Oh, yeah?

02:33.594 --> 02:36.420
Been workin' on it for about nine months
and finally he agrees to hear me out.

02:36.620 --> 02:40.291
- Hey, well, he's a busy man, your father.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, no shit.

02:40.391 --> 02:42.426
- All right. See ya later, fellas.
- All right, see ya.

02:42.526 --> 02:46.464
- Hey, guys.
- What's up, Jimmy? How you doin'?

02:52.636 --> 02:55.038
Christ! Can I get one moment to myself?

02:55.138 --> 02:58.108
- Hey, Danny.
- Hey. What do you want?

02:58.208 --> 03:02.279
I talked to your father this mornin'
and the heater blew over at my place.

03:02.379 --> 03:04.081
He told me to ask you about a loan.

03:04.181 --> 03:05.352
- A loan?
- Yeah.

03:05.452 --> 03:08.184
- Or a handout?
- Naw, it's just a loan.

03:08.584 --> 03:10.687
Why he keeps you around, I got no idea.

03:10.787 --> 03:13.924
- All right. How much do you need?
- About eight hundred.

03:14.024 --> 03:16.827
I don't know what "about eight hundred"
means, Jimmy. Give me a number.

03:18.409 --> 03:20.498
- Eight hundred?
- Eight hundred?

03:22.272 --> 03:24.124
- All right.
- Thanks, Danny.

03:24.224 --> 03:28.171
Jee... you know... McCauley, he...
the son of a bitch canceled on me.

03:29.271 --> 03:31.542
I need a Santa for a Christmas
party this afternoon.

03:34.578 --> 03:36.446
- Santa Claus?
- Yeah.

03:36.946 --> 03:38.482
- Jeez, Danny, I...
- You'll be great.

03:38.582 --> 03:42.419
- Find someone else? I gotta get home.
- Yeah. I'll get somebody else.

03:43.424 --> 03:45.689
You freeze your little nuts off.

03:47.189 --> 03:48.303
Come on, Danny.

04:09.412 --> 04:12.397
You see that? You see that switch?
I switch, and then I get out.

04:12.497 --> 04:13.483
- Yeah.
- And then you're out.

04:13.583 --> 04:15.626
- You control him with the jab.
- Yeah.

04:15.726 --> 04:16.666
- All right?
- Right.

04:16.766 --> 04:20.093
Put the phone down.
Watch me with your own eyes. Okay?

04:20.192 --> 04:21.517
What the fuck, man?

04:26.296 --> 04:27.998
Oh, shit! Yo!

04:32.635 --> 04:34.472
- Yo, look at his face.
- Sorry, man.

04:35.272 --> 04:37.223
Get the fuck outta here.

04:37.323 --> 04:39.943
- You started it.
- Walk of shame.

04:41.143 --> 04:44.881
- Yo, Mike, you knocked him the fuck out.
- What'd I tell you about talkin' like that?

04:44.981 --> 04:46.554
My bust.

04:46.654 --> 04:48.384
- See how I kept my elbows tight?
- Yeah, I saw 'em.

04:48.484 --> 04:51.304
You gotta be careful fighting Garrity.
He's gonna wanna push you against the ropes.

04:51.404 --> 04:54.959
Just give him one of these.
Knock his shit-talkin' mouth right out.

04:56.059 --> 04:59.029
- Sorry. It slipped.
- Go ahead, Legs.

04:59.129 --> 05:02.332
Gonna find out real soon
how fast it can all slip away.

05:02.432 --> 05:04.671
- Relax, Mike. I was just messing around.
- That's your problem.

05:04.771 --> 05:08.072
You got all the talent in the world
and all you wanna do is mess around.

05:12.241 --> 05:16.046
I'm told that you're a man
of influence, Mr. Maguire,

05:16.146 --> 05:20.450
that nothing moves in or out
of this borough without your approval.

05:21.006 --> 05:26.423
And my employers are looking for a partner
to help bring our product into the city.

05:26.523 --> 05:28.125
We use our contacts in the union, pop.

05:28.325 --> 05:32.095
Three bins a month,
dockworkers know which bins are comin' in

05:32.195 --> 05:35.532
and all they gotta do is make sure
they pass through without inspection.

05:36.132 --> 05:37.835
What exactly is your product?

05:40.003 --> 05:41.504
Heroin.

05:42.341 --> 05:45.609
99% pure. The very best in the world.

05:45.809 --> 05:48.078
And my son told you
I'd be interested in this?

05:48.478 --> 05:50.254
Very interested.

05:54.416 --> 05:56.419
The business has changed, Mr. Grezda.

05:56.919 --> 06:00.022
Twenty years ago, I made a living
the same way we all did.

06:00.122 --> 06:04.424
Couple big scores a year,
but mostly I was a grinder.

06:04.524 --> 06:07.063
Now, you want to lay down
on a few ballgames, you came to me.

06:07.962 --> 06:11.852
You want to open up a butcher shop
and the bank said "fuck you" on a loan,

06:11.952 --> 06:14.121
you came to me.

06:14.221 --> 06:17.083
You know what that butcher shop
is today?

06:17.183 --> 06:19.434
- No.
- An applebee's.

06:21.444 --> 06:22.980
Why are you telling me this?

06:23.080 --> 06:28.785
Because I've had to adapt to the times.
I am a legitimate businessman now.

06:30.487 --> 06:34.991
I know your business, Mr. Maguire.
That's why I'm here.

06:35.391 --> 06:37.492
You're wasting your time.

06:37.601 --> 06:39.279
Hey, hey. Wait! Come on, now.

06:39.379 --> 06:44.132
Pop, just listen to what he has to say.
You haven't heard the offer yet.

06:44.232 --> 06:48.309
Two million dollars up front. After that,
you'll receive 20% of all the product

06:48.409 --> 06:50.864
you allow to pass safely
through the port.

06:50.964 --> 06:52.509
The answer's no.

06:54.271 --> 06:55.679
Take the night to think it over.

06:55.779 --> 06:59.916
Once you've considered it more carefully,
you'll realize the mistake you are making.

07:00.764 --> 07:04.487
How do you think I survived
in this business for 35 years?

07:04.587 --> 07:06.134
Everyone I came up with is either dead

07:06.234 --> 07:08.720
or locked up in federal prison
waitin' to be buried.

07:09.491 --> 07:12.104
I don't make mistakes.

07:16.732 --> 07:18.469
It's Christmas time.

07:18.569 --> 07:22.706
My friends are here to celebrate with me.
Get the fuck outta my house.

07:26.543 --> 07:27.619
Take this shit with ya.

07:38.754 --> 07:40.424
Guys. My old man. I don't even know
what just happened.

07:40.524 --> 07:42.979
We paid you to guarantee
your father's support.

07:43.079 --> 07:45.395
Just let me talk to him, all right?
I'll get it all figured out.

07:45.495 --> 07:49.625
I'll be stopping by your house tonight...
to pick up our money.

07:49.725 --> 07:52.735
You know what happens
if you don't have it.

07:52.835 --> 07:55.839
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, guys.

07:56.906 --> 07:59.642
Fucking garbage. I hate Albanians.

07:59.792 --> 08:01.612
What the fuck was that?

08:02.012 --> 08:04.214
Did you even listen
to what he had to say?

08:04.314 --> 08:05.716
That's not our business, Danny.

08:07.450 --> 08:10.753
Shut your mouth.
I'm talkin' to my father.

08:12.121 --> 08:14.734
- What's the problem, Danny?
- The problem is...

08:14.834 --> 08:18.955
all I ever hear outta your mouth
is when am I gonna pull my weight?

08:19.195 --> 08:20.768
And now I bring you
a piece of business...

08:20.868 --> 08:22.688
- A good piece of business.
- And you're mad

08:22.788 --> 08:24.900
- because I let it walk out the door.
- Yeah.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.904
When I was younger,
somebody made me the same proposal.

08:28.004 --> 08:30.407
I made so much money
bringing cocaine into the city,

08:30.507 --> 08:32.525
I had to rent a storage unit
to store all the cash.

08:32.626 --> 08:35.445
The problem was,
everybody got hooked on the shit.

08:35.945 --> 08:39.448
I watched my friends rot away in front of me
until I couldn't recognize them anymore.

08:40.549 --> 08:43.486
I had to kill people I loved
because I couldn't trust them.

08:46.154 --> 08:49.238
Not enough money in the world
to pull me back in.

08:49.338 --> 08:52.429
Pop, I made promises to these people.

08:52.529 --> 08:56.116
- I can't just walk away.
- You made a mess.

08:56.216 --> 08:58.936
It's time somebody other than me
cleaned it up.

09:17.520 --> 09:22.629
One, two, three, four, five,

09:22.729 --> 09:26.379
- Lily, what are you doin' in here?
- I'm hiding from Catelyn.

09:26.479 --> 09:28.465
...nine, ten.

09:31.567 --> 09:34.004
- Is she in here?
- Is who in here? She's over there.

09:38.174 --> 09:39.695
- I see you.
- It doesn't count!

09:39.795 --> 09:41.711
- You have to tag me!
- I said I see you.

09:41.811 --> 09:45.115
Doesn't count unless you tag her.
It doesn't count unless you tag her.

09:45.215 --> 09:46.382
- You didn't touch her.
- Tag!

09:46.482 --> 09:48.801
- You got tagged.
- Didn't I tell you girls to get ready?

09:48.901 --> 09:52.489
We're going to your uncle Ricky's house.
Go on. Get your butts in that room.

09:53.303 --> 09:54.711
- I thought you were off tonight.
- I was.

09:54.811 --> 09:56.860
Till somebody broke her wrist
fallin' off-a the jungle gym.

09:56.960 --> 09:58.462
So you're not comin'
to Ricky's for dinner?

09:58.562 --> 10:00.936
I can pay the hospital bill or go to Ricky's
for dinner. What do you want me to do?

10:01.036 --> 10:03.133
I want you to do what you promised.
And you said Friday...

10:03.233 --> 10:06.136
Don't tell me what I said.
I know what I said.

10:06.636 --> 10:09.477
Fine. I don't want you there anyway
if you're gonna act like an asshole.

10:09.577 --> 10:12.401
Hey! Come on.

10:13.709 --> 10:14.911
Hey.

10:16.679 --> 10:20.481
- Come on. I'm sorry.
- You better be.

10:20.581 --> 10:22.618
- What're you working on?
- It's for the baby.

10:22.718 --> 10:26.240
Show him what our lives were like
before he came along. You like it?

10:31.934 --> 10:35.199
- I'm sorry. I forgot to take it out.
- No, it's all right.

10:36.199 --> 10:37.667
There.

10:38.367 --> 10:40.771
Now I won't have to see him
for another five years.

10:44.207 --> 10:46.697
We want Santa! We want Santa!

10:46.797 --> 10:48.425
Jimmy?

10:49.811 --> 10:53.148
- Kids are waitin' for you.
- Yeah, I know. I'm comin'.

10:58.555 --> 11:03.164
And a bitty baby
and a Barbie power wheels car

11:03.264 --> 11:05.908
and a Nintendo 3DS.

11:06.008 --> 11:08.425
- And a hello kitty backpack...
- Yeah.

11:08.865 --> 11:10.834
Merry Christmas. There you go.

11:11.334 --> 11:12.919
But I wasn't finished.

11:13.019 --> 11:17.274
I'll read this on the way back
to the north pole. Okay? There you go.

11:17.374 --> 11:20.609
Whose idea was it to get Jimmy
to do this thing?

11:21.811 --> 11:24.247
Okay. Who's next?

11:25.502 --> 11:27.744
This little girl.

11:28.051 --> 11:29.386
What's your name, sweetie?

11:29.486 --> 11:30.787
- Kristen.
- Kristen.

11:30.987 --> 11:33.523
Mommy? Santa smells funny.

11:33.623 --> 11:36.325
You think Mommy wants to sit
on Santa's other knee?

11:36.425 --> 11:41.029
- I think Mommy's a little too big.
- Oh, Santa can make lotsa room on here.

11:41.129 --> 11:42.573
That's my wife, Jimmy.

11:43.273 --> 11:46.068
Frank. It's Christmas.

11:47.268 --> 11:50.389
Gimme a call
if you wanna break the Irish curse.

11:50.839 --> 11:53.843
I'm skinny, but I'm long.

11:55.111 --> 11:59.549
Okay... let's see what Santa
brought you this year, Kristie.

12:03.587 --> 12:07.056
Shit! Fuck! Fucking kids!

12:07.256 --> 12:09.397
- Jesus Christ!
- Where is he going?

12:09.497 --> 12:11.761
- Santa'll be right back, kids.
- I didn't get to read my list.

12:12.461 --> 12:14.097
Get in there!

12:14.297 --> 12:17.265
Jesus, guy, come on. It's Christmas.

12:18.061 --> 12:20.176
Oh, God.

12:21.384 --> 12:24.524
Hey, Pat. When you get done
in there, get him a meal...

12:24.624 --> 12:27.643
- and some water.
- Come on, Pat, gimme a drink.

12:54.703 --> 12:56.839
You remember what that's from,
don't you?

12:57.989 --> 13:02.211
Must have been, what,
the summer of '71? Point Pleasant.

13:02.411 --> 13:04.746
'70. We enlisted that fall.

13:04.846 --> 13:08.885
That's right. I was in that bed
with Jenny Blake.

13:08.985 --> 13:13.155
You were in this one with...
you know, what was that redhead's name?

13:13.255 --> 13:15.123
- Maureen Galvin.
- Yeah.

13:15.223 --> 13:18.060
All of a sudden, from downstairs,
my father's voice booms out:

13:18.160 --> 13:20.230
"Who the hell's
been drinking my scotch?"

13:20.330 --> 13:22.799
And Jenny, she jumped off me
so fast... bam!

13:22.899 --> 13:26.336
She smacked her head right
on that thing, knocked herself out.

13:31.323 --> 13:34.511
- You get enough to eat?
- Yeah, yeah.

13:34.611 --> 13:36.579
Got plenty left over,
you wanna take some home.

13:36.679 --> 13:39.683
No. I'm fine.

13:40.282 --> 13:42.686
Rosie mad at me?

13:42.786 --> 13:45.355
She'll get over it.

13:45.455 --> 13:46.730
Gimme a cigarette, will ya?

13:48.491 --> 13:51.580
She'll think the smell's
coming from you.

14:01.470 --> 14:04.491
You wanna tell me what's goin' on?

14:06.942 --> 14:09.210
Come on, Jimmy.

14:13.014 --> 14:16.052
You look like a goddamn castaway.

14:18.407 --> 14:21.457
I can't sleep no more, Shawn.

14:21.887 --> 14:24.661
I keep seeing their faces in my dreams.

14:24.911 --> 14:28.280
- Whose faces?
- All of 'em.

14:28.380 --> 14:31.301
Terry Burke. Vince Amato.

14:31.401 --> 14:33.836
Ernie Hayes.

14:35.135 --> 14:36.900
It was different then, Jimmy.

14:39.342 --> 14:41.511
We did what we did because we had to.

14:43.011 --> 14:44.648
Billy, too.

14:45.548 --> 14:48.090
I see Billy a lot.

14:52.245 --> 14:55.659
I got no one left in my life
because of the things I done.

14:58.094 --> 15:01.130
I chased everyone away.

15:03.467 --> 15:04.637
Look at me.

15:05.468 --> 15:07.993
Look at me.

15:08.560 --> 15:11.273
What do I always tell you?

15:12.191 --> 15:16.578
Wherever we're going,
when we cross that line,

15:17.278 --> 15:19.807
we're going together.

15:20.617 --> 15:22.352
Me and you.

15:23.752 --> 15:25.621
Me and you.

15:26.762 --> 15:28.858
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:06.460 --> 16:08.465
Excuse me, buddy,
where the hell are you taking us?

16:09.265 --> 16:11.574
There's construction
on the Manhattan bridge.

16:11.674 --> 16:13.970
Traffic's a mess over there,
so I'm tryin' to save you a little time.

16:14.070 --> 16:17.383
Or make yourself a little more money?

16:17.483 --> 16:21.011
Trust me, okay?
I lived there my whole life.

16:34.523 --> 16:38.548
<i>Just one hour away from another chapter
in a historic rivalry</i>

16:38.648 --> 16:41.253
<i>that is the New Jersey Devils
and the New York Rangers</i>

16:41.353 --> 16:43.346
<i>at Madison Square Garden in New York.</i>

16:43.446 --> 16:47.303
<i>It is a crucial game in the eastern
conference standings for both teams.</i>

16:47.403 --> 16:49.873
Look who it is.

16:49.973 --> 16:52.158
- You wanna join us?
- I'm expecting someone.

16:52.258 --> 16:56.779
Bullshit, Jimmy. You don't got any friends.
Detective Torres, meet Jimmy Conlon.

16:57.079 --> 16:59.111
Jimmy and I spent a lot
of quality time together

16:59.211 --> 17:01.551
back when he was killing people
for Shawn Maguire.

17:01.651 --> 17:02.551
Nice to meet you, Jimmy.

17:02.651 --> 17:06.888
We had a name for him on homicide
task force. Jimmy The Gravedigger.

17:07.895 --> 17:10.604
What happened to the other guy?
That ginzo?

17:10.704 --> 17:12.130
- Tornetta.
- Yeah. The ginzo.

17:12.230 --> 17:16.976
He retired. I guess he got tired of workin'
with a D.A. on Maguire's payroll.

17:17.076 --> 17:19.135
Tired of watching murderers
like you walk free.

17:19.435 --> 17:21.936
Maybe you should have taken a bite
outta that pie, Harding.

17:22.137 --> 17:24.073
You still wouldn't be wearing
suits like that.

17:24.173 --> 17:27.142
You're breaking my heart.
You don't like my suits.

17:27.242 --> 17:29.445
What's the number, Jim?

17:30.813 --> 17:33.682
What's the number?
Tornetta had you at sixteen.

17:33.982 --> 17:36.946
I always thought it was more.
I made a list once. All the names.

17:37.046 --> 17:39.756
- How'd that work out?
- Seventeen.

17:40.556 --> 17:43.726
You see, Tornetta,
he didn't have Ernest Hayes.

17:44.626 --> 17:48.497
- But that was yours.
- Doesn't ring a bell. Sorry.

17:48.597 --> 17:50.128
I get a letter from his widow,

17:50.628 --> 17:53.936
every year, handwritten,
asking me if I got any new information.

17:54.036 --> 17:57.256
25 years later,
she's still lookin' for closure.

17:58.474 --> 18:01.827
I got stacks of those letters...
crowdin' my fuckin' desk.

18:01.927 --> 18:05.011
That get under your skin at all?

18:10.738 --> 18:14.023
Why don't you whisper it to me.
What's the number, Jim?

18:14.423 --> 18:16.059
What's the number?

18:22.297 --> 18:26.502
Tell your partner they don't serve
chimichangas in here.

18:27.202 --> 18:28.606
You know when the nightmares...

18:28.876 --> 18:31.869
when they get so bad you can't
look at yourself in the mirror no more,

18:31.969 --> 18:34.433
you give me a call.

18:37.846 --> 18:40.416
Let's go. Suddenly I lost my appetite.

18:42.151 --> 18:45.221
<i>...and we are now less than an hour to go
until the puck drops.</i>

18:49.103 --> 18:50.234
Get the door.

18:53.862 --> 18:57.166
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, there the boys are!

19:00.576 --> 19:03.204
Be gentle. Be gentle.

19:03.305 --> 19:05.774
You're grabbing
the real weapon there, baby.

19:07.101 --> 19:10.212
Hey, Danny! My boy!

19:10.634 --> 19:12.682
- What do you think?
- Nice apartment.

19:12.782 --> 19:13.916
Come on in. Sit down.

19:15.407 --> 19:17.637
So, Danny...

19:18.087 --> 19:20.184
Where's our money?

19:20.861 --> 19:23.325
You're a businessman.
I like that about you.

19:25.288 --> 19:27.864
All right. You heard him.
Get him his money.

19:30.966 --> 19:33.770
<i>In New York City, which means
we're less than twenty minutes to go</i>

19:33.870 --> 19:36.439
<i>till the opening face-off
between the New York rangers...</i>

19:36.539 --> 19:39.743
Jesus Christ. Hey, Legs!

19:41.844 --> 19:43.681
Come here.

19:44.681 --> 19:46.749
What'd I tell you about riding
around these streets alone?

19:46.849 --> 19:48.737
I don't gotta answer your questions.
You're not my dad, Mike.

19:48.837 --> 19:52.288
- So that's how it is between us now.
- Yeah. That's how it is.

19:53.988 --> 19:56.492
Your mom know you're out here?

19:56.892 --> 20:00.230
What if I called her? Let her know
you're out here on your own?

20:02.861 --> 20:07.370
- We have some serious weapons here?
- That's loaded! That's loaded!

20:10.572 --> 20:12.208
Look. I'll go home
if you give me a ride.

20:12.308 --> 20:14.109
I can't give you a ride.
I'm with a client right now.

20:14.209 --> 20:17.714
Come on, Mike. Just let me sit inside.
I ain't never been in a limo before.

20:17.814 --> 20:20.024
Look. I won't break anything. I promise.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.654
All right. If I let you inside,
you'll go home straight after?

20:24.754 --> 20:27.588
- You go home straight after?
- Promise. Straight after.

20:29.243 --> 20:30.867
Caught him.

20:33.029 --> 20:35.362
It's all there. Count it.

20:44.376 --> 20:45.375
Boh!

20:45.975 --> 20:48.378
- Do you find this funny, Danny?
- Think about what you can do with that money!

20:48.488 --> 20:51.614
You can put up a luxury high-rise
on park place.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.919
<i>...so excited at what they can do
in the playoffs...</i>

20:58.617 --> 21:01.346
Oh, dang, this is my song, Mike.

21:05.602 --> 21:06.995
Danny.

21:09.132 --> 21:13.269
Do you have any idea
what we gonna do to you?

21:13.769 --> 21:14.837
No.

21:38.360 --> 21:40.595
Look, I'm...

21:40.695 --> 21:44.365
I'm sorry about what I said earlier.
I was upset with myself, not with you.

21:44.465 --> 21:46.269
It's all right. I was just worried
you weren't gonna come back.

21:46.369 --> 21:47.503
I'm not going anywhere.

22:09.692 --> 22:12.228
Yo, Mike. Mike, check this out.

22:14.963 --> 22:17.298
Shit. Get down!

22:21.437 --> 22:23.706
Get outta the car.

22:23.806 --> 22:26.343
Danny. It's Mike.

22:32.147 --> 22:34.715
Get out of the car. Get out!

22:35.951 --> 22:38.127
Fuck.

22:38.227 --> 22:40.640
Move. Move. Move.

23:28.818 --> 23:29.973
Shit.

24:27.462 --> 24:29.232
I found this in his jacket.

24:33.818 --> 24:35.630
What do we do?

24:35.730 --> 24:37.206
- Move!
- I think you should call your dad.

24:50.672 --> 24:53.892
<i>...live and we are ready
for the opening face-off center ice</i>

24:53.992 --> 24:56.425
<i>at Madison square garden in New York.</i>

24:56.525 --> 24:58.721
<i>Off the face, New Jersey
in control, Henrique.</i>

24:58.821 --> 25:00.730
<i>Henrique gives it to Jaromir Jรกgr,</i>

25:00.830 --> 25:03.399
<i>and he gets the puck all the way down
near the goal line.</i>

25:03.499 --> 25:07.069
<i>Sends it in front
and it's cleared out by Lundqvist...</i>

25:10.505 --> 25:12.407
Hey, Shawn.

25:12.507 --> 25:15.086
Listen, sorry again about...

25:17.346 --> 25:19.236
What?

25:20.215 --> 25:22.217
Michael?

25:22.717 --> 25:24.759
My Michael?

25:27.086 --> 25:30.058
Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

26:16.939 --> 26:19.708
Gabby? Gabby?

26:20.208 --> 26:22.178
Gabby? Catelyn?

26:22.278 --> 26:24.280
Lily?

26:26.961 --> 26:30.363
Tell Danny to stay put
until I hear from Jimmy.

26:30.613 --> 26:32.366
What about the Albanians?

26:32.466 --> 26:34.560
It won't be long before they realize
Grezda's not around.

26:34.660 --> 26:37.034
They'll come after Danny.

26:39.562 --> 26:44.157
- What are you thinking about?
- The exact moment my son went wrong.

26:50.595 --> 26:53.014
Hey, Ricky. It's me.
Put Gabby on the phone.

26:55.042 --> 26:56.318
- <i>Michael?</i>
- Hey.

26:56.418 --> 26:59.215
Listen. I need you and the girls to stay
at Ricky's until I call you back, okay?

26:59.315 --> 27:01.450
- <i>What? Why do we have to stay here?</i>
- Gabby?

27:01.550 --> 27:04.536
- <i>No! Tell me what's going on, Michael!</i>
- Gabby? Goddamn it!

27:04.636 --> 27:08.668
I don't wanna yell, but it's the only way
I can get through to you! Hello?

27:10.112 --> 27:12.090
Hello?

27:48.403 --> 27:51.488
- Can I come in?
- What are you doing here?

27:51.767 --> 27:54.136
I got a call from Shawn.
You talk to the police yet?

27:54.236 --> 27:57.105
- Talk to the police about what?
- We both know why I'm here, Michael.

27:57.205 --> 27:58.974
Now, let's figure this out
so no one else gets hurt.

27:59.074 --> 28:01.777
You stay out of my house,
you understand me?

28:02.765 --> 28:05.212
What are you gonna do with that thing?

28:18.592 --> 28:21.124
So, what, they sent you
to keep me quiet?

28:21.224 --> 28:24.200
Shawn would...
well, he'd appreciate your support.

28:24.300 --> 28:26.068
You mean he'd appreciate me
keeping my mouth shut.

28:26.168 --> 28:29.206
- Yeah.
- Who were they?

28:29.306 --> 28:31.202
I don't know.

28:31.602 --> 28:34.456
Whatever Danny did,
I'm sure he had a reason for it.

28:34.556 --> 28:36.178
You always had a reason?

28:36.971 --> 28:39.882
Or were you just...
following marchin' orders?

28:40.852 --> 28:42.818
Let's just get through the night?

28:43.218 --> 28:46.687
After that, you can go back
to hate me all you want.

28:50.959 --> 28:52.468
Yeah.

28:52.568 --> 28:54.729
Yeah, I get it.

28:54.829 --> 28:57.098
I get it! All right. Yeah.

28:57.198 --> 29:00.234
No, I'm not goin' nowhere.

29:01.301 --> 29:03.805
Oh, that's the house here.

29:04.405 --> 29:06.764
3428 56th Drive. That's it.

29:13.482 --> 29:16.685
Are you sure you wanna do this?
I mean, your old man told us to stay put.

29:16.785 --> 29:19.988
He wants me to clean up my mess.
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

29:20.088 --> 29:21.669
Well, I think we should wait
for Jimmy to get here.

29:21.769 --> 29:24.293
Maybe you shouldn't think so much.

29:26.628 --> 29:28.460
You don't smoke in my house.

29:34.602 --> 29:37.311
The place looks nice.

29:37.411 --> 29:41.626
- I haven't been here since...
- Since Mom's funeral.

29:41.726 --> 29:46.347
- It was nice of you to show up.
- Well, I heard there was free booze.

29:49.918 --> 29:51.220
It's funny to you.

29:51.720 --> 29:53.857
- Just trying to be...
- Yeah.

29:58.894 --> 30:01.897
Five years and it takes Shawn Maguire
for you to come see me.

30:01.997 --> 30:05.681
- You never wanted me to come see you.
- Because you're trash.

30:05.781 --> 30:08.637
And I don't want trash around my family.

30:08.937 --> 30:13.223
They shoulda locked you up a long time ago.
Made you pay for the things you did.

30:13.323 --> 30:15.084
Just because I'm not
behind bars doesn't mean

30:15.184 --> 30:18.919
I'm not paying for what I did, Michael.

30:43.382 --> 30:44.973
So, what happens now?

30:45.073 --> 30:48.850
I'll go see Shawn.
Let him know we talked.

30:48.950 --> 30:51.446
I'm sure he'll wanna show
his appreciation.

30:51.546 --> 30:54.183
A little money
he could set aside for the girls.

30:54.583 --> 30:56.229
- Catelyn and Lily.
- What's that?

30:56.329 --> 30:58.320
My daughters' names.

30:59.320 --> 31:02.475
Catelyn Grace Conlon
and Lily Margaret Conlon.

31:02.575 --> 31:04.409
I know what their names are.
Do they know mine?

31:04.509 --> 31:09.097
They don't got a reason to know yours.
You're not a part of their lives.

31:09.497 --> 31:11.246
It's bad enough you were part of mine.

31:17.104 --> 31:20.141
- Goodbye, Michael.
- Goodbye, Jimmy.

32:13.785 --> 32:16.865
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

32:17.946 --> 32:20.301
Call an ambulance.

32:24.706 --> 32:26.918
What are you just standing there for?
Call an ambulance!

32:27.018 --> 32:29.826
You're wasting your time.

32:49.765 --> 32:51.366
Hello.

32:51.466 --> 32:55.470
<i>Yeah. It's me.</i>

32:56.003 --> 32:57.540
How'd it go with Michael?

32:59.607 --> 33:01.532
<i>Hello?</i>

33:02.009 --> 33:05.080
<i>I just killed your boy, Shawn.</i>

33:05.580 --> 33:08.547
I just killed Danny.

33:10.984 --> 33:13.794
<i>I had to. He was gonna shoot Michael.</i>

33:26.834 --> 33:30.870
- Are you sure he's dead?
- Yeah. I'm sure.

33:32.841 --> 33:35.444
Who is it, honey?

33:38.812 --> 33:41.495
You know how this has to end.

33:42.717 --> 33:45.087
Yeah, I know.

33:46.587 --> 33:48.098
For Michael, too.

33:50.098 --> 33:51.146
Yeah.

33:56.030 --> 33:57.745
<i>Hey, Shawn.</i>

34:00.445 --> 34:04.124
Wherever we're going,
when we cross that line...

34:04.572 --> 34:07.108
we're going together.

34:07.434 --> 34:08.844
Right?

34:28.016 --> 34:29.405
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling the cops.

34:29.505 --> 34:33.068
You don't wanna do that. Trust me.

34:36.837 --> 34:38.378
Get out of my house.

34:39.908 --> 34:43.715
Get out of my house!
Get out of my house!

34:45.080 --> 34:46.398
Get out!

35:00.361 --> 35:02.164
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

35:02.264 --> 35:03.829
This is Michael Conlon.

35:04.229 --> 35:06.917
3428 56th Drive.

35:07.017 --> 35:10.588
A man's been... shot and killed here.

35:10.688 --> 35:14.167
- In self-defense.
- <i>Did you shoot the victim?</i>

35:15.867 --> 35:17.745
No.

35:18.245 --> 35:19.703
My father did.

35:25.265 --> 35:27.654
Oh, no.

35:44.339 --> 35:50.045
<i>Report of a shooting at 3428 56th Drive.
All area units respond. Over.</i>

35:52.980 --> 35:54.921
- You Michael Conlon?
- Yes, sir.

35:55.021 --> 35:58.819
- Officers Randle and Colston.
- Come on in.

36:01.189 --> 36:02.790
I don't know where to start...

36:02.890 --> 36:06.328
I work as a limousine driver,
and earlier today I picked up a reservation.

36:07.228 --> 36:09.464
Two gentlemen
at the Gramercy Park Hotel.

36:09.564 --> 36:12.701
And... and they wanted me
to take them to Ridgewood.

36:12.801 --> 36:16.770
Lift your arms for me, please.
Lace your fingers together behind your head.

36:16.870 --> 36:19.575
- Turn around, please.
- Yes, sir.

36:21.366 --> 36:23.488
What the he...? What the hell?
I'm trying to explain to you.

36:23.588 --> 36:25.444
You feel that?

36:25.544 --> 36:28.016
Say another word and I'll blow
your fuckin' teeth out your ear.

36:32.287 --> 36:34.923
I'm not hiding anything.
I'm trying to explain to you.

36:35.023 --> 36:38.860
Officer, you're making a fuckin'
mistake here. I'm trying to tell you...

36:56.144 --> 37:00.682
Six-double-0-five at 3438 56th drive.
That ALS unit en route?

37:01.082 --> 37:03.946
<i>Ten-four, six-double-0 five.
Westbound on 32nd.</i>

37:04.046 --> 37:06.332
All right. Let 'em know there's a deceased
white male in the kitchen.

37:06.432 --> 37:09.925
Neighbors saw an armed suspect
flee the building just before we arrived.

37:10.025 --> 37:12.360
- What the hell are you talkin' about?
- White male, black sweatpants,

37:12.460 --> 37:14.740
- black hoodie. Approximately 6'3".
- What the hell you doin', man?

37:14.840 --> 37:17.542
- Suspect is armed.
- He's lying! I'm in the car!

37:17.642 --> 37:19.534
We're gonna take a drive around
to see if we can locate him.

37:19.634 --> 37:22.287
- Hey! Let me outta here!
- <i>Ten-four, six-double-0 five.</i>

37:22.387 --> 37:24.922
Let me outta here! Let me outta here!

37:33.281 --> 37:35.476
Where you takin' me?

37:45.126 --> 37:47.461
Hey, that's Frank.

37:48.061 --> 37:50.846
He wants us to follow him.

38:37.345 --> 38:39.027
Get outta here!

39:29.175 --> 39:30.788
Oh, shit!

39:34.235 --> 39:36.157
Watch out! Watch out! Watch out!

39:55.924 --> 39:57.497
He's still comin'.

40:22.016 --> 40:22.980
Shit!

40:49.510 --> 40:51.813
He's comin' back.
This fuckin' guy won't quit.

40:53.848 --> 40:56.383
Watch it! Watch it! Watch it!

41:10.271 --> 41:12.393
Get back! Get back!

41:12.493 --> 41:14.562
Get back!

41:18.439 --> 41:19.998
Mike. Mike!

41:21.809 --> 41:23.841
My God.

41:29.417 --> 41:30.747
Cover your face!

41:36.056 --> 41:38.145
Give me your hands.

41:42.129 --> 41:43.798
- You okay?
- No! I'm not okay.

41:43.898 --> 41:46.332
Come on! Let's move!

41:54.376 --> 41:55.655
Come on.

42:01.982 --> 42:03.452
Don't do it, son!

42:08.455 --> 42:10.986
Come on. We gotta move.

42:17.765 --> 42:19.802
Come on!

42:25.081 --> 42:27.809
What the fuck?! Hey!

42:27.909 --> 42:29.576
Hey, asshole!

42:29.676 --> 42:31.623
Slow down.

42:33.515 --> 42:36.182
Come on, let's go! Move, move, move!

42:46.360 --> 42:49.356
- You owe me $2.50, dickhead.
- Back off, pal.

42:49.456 --> 42:51.384
I'm not gonna back off!
You stole my fare.

42:51.484 --> 42:53.134
I'm not gonna say it again.

42:53.234 --> 42:54.985
- Are you kidding?!
- Get lost!

42:55.085 --> 42:56.573
I'm not gonna get lost.

42:56.673 --> 42:59.108
- You should at least apologize.
- Look, I'll give ya the money.

43:00.008 --> 43:03.044
Take it easy, man. Jesus Christ.

43:04.083 --> 43:06.577
Forget about it. It's just $2.50.

44:11.479 --> 44:14.236
Hey, Frank. Your wife called me earlier.

44:14.336 --> 44:16.684
Yeah? What'd she say?

44:16.784 --> 44:20.077
She wants to take me up on my offer.

44:20.177 --> 44:22.756
- Is that right?
- I gotta tell ya.

44:22.856 --> 44:26.494
I've never seen a woman
swallow twelve inches the way she does.

45:00.594 --> 45:03.166
<i>South entrance clear.</i>

45:36.896 --> 45:42.147
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we are being held
momentarily by train traffic ahead of us.</i>

45:52.580 --> 45:54.631
Jimmy.

46:09.897 --> 46:11.765
Maria.

46:11.865 --> 46:15.436
Rose is asleep.
Don't wake her till the mornin'.

46:16.636 --> 46:19.540
Load the bodies from Danny's
into Michael's limousine.

46:19.640 --> 46:22.142
Dump the car where the cops can find it.

46:22.242 --> 46:24.946
Make sure everything points to Michael.

46:31.652 --> 46:36.057
I know. It's my fault. Every shitty
little thing in your life is my fault, right?

46:36.157 --> 46:38.125
- I'm turning myself in.
- Not yet, you're not.

46:38.525 --> 46:40.493
Shawn's gonna come after you, Michael.

46:40.593 --> 46:43.397
And if he can't get to you,
he's gonna go after your family.

46:43.497 --> 46:45.800
Right now you've gotta worry
about staying alive.

46:45.900 --> 46:49.270
And I'm the best chance you've got.
I know how this works.

46:49.370 --> 46:51.138
I want people at his house.

46:51.238 --> 46:54.073
<i>Right now, Shawn's got everyone
meeting at the Abbey.</i>

46:54.173 --> 46:56.410
<i>And from there, they're gonna start
pulling your life apart.</i>

46:56.510 --> 46:58.445
<i>Friends, family, coworkers.</i>

46:58.545 --> 47:01.215
- Go!
- Anyone that can connect them to you.

47:10.991 --> 47:13.327
And the cops?
They've got their own motivation.

47:14.082 --> 47:16.397
<i>You know what they do to cop killers?</i>

47:16.497 --> 47:19.732
<i>They don't like to leave it
in a jury's hands.</i>

47:21.735 --> 47:23.770
Hey, Paul. Yeah.

47:23.870 --> 47:25.406
- I got what you need.
- Got it.

47:25.806 --> 47:28.599
Let's go. Woodhaven, Queens.

47:29.577 --> 47:32.379
There's gotta be a few good cops.
Someone'll listen.

47:32.479 --> 47:35.115
The good cops won't listen to you
'cause you're my son.

47:35.215 --> 47:39.053
25 years, I've been chasing this son
of a bitch. This has gotta end tonight.

47:39.153 --> 47:42.823
<i>And those two bodies from Danny's place,
Shawn will make sure they point back to you.</i>

47:42.923 --> 47:46.426
<i>This is fourteen-eighty two. We got
a one-eight-seven in the suspect vehicle.</i>

47:46.526 --> 47:49.262
They just found two bodies
inside of Mike Conlon's limousine.

47:49.362 --> 47:52.266
Albanians. Part of a gang
that operates out of Brooklyn.

47:52.366 --> 47:55.603
<i>Right now, we're the most
wanted men in this city.</i>

47:56.503 --> 47:58.105
Michael, listen to me.

47:58.405 --> 48:02.610
One night. That's all I'm asking.
Listen to your father for one night.

48:02.710 --> 48:05.613
If I can't figure this out by the morning,
I'll walk myself into the precinct

48:05.713 --> 48:07.815
and tell 'em I blew
those two officers away.

48:08.415 --> 48:11.318
One night. Then you never
have to see me again.

48:12.968 --> 48:14.990
One night.

48:22.729 --> 48:24.752
This way.

48:39.913 --> 48:41.382
- Gimme your lace.
- What?

48:41.482 --> 48:43.987
Your shoelace. Come on.

48:48.856 --> 48:50.390
What're you doin'?

48:50.790 --> 48:54.235
- Where's your family?
- My brother-in law's.

48:54.335 --> 48:57.698
I want you to drive there.
Make sure they're safe.

48:58.659 --> 49:01.159
Don't move until you hear from me.

49:03.936 --> 49:05.818
Wow.

49:13.079 --> 49:14.081
Where're you gonna go?

49:14.181 --> 49:17.785
I'm gonna talk to Shawn.
See if we can fix this thing.

49:23.055 --> 49:24.890
Hey.

49:25.614 --> 49:28.163
Stay off the main streets. Yeah?

49:45.456 --> 49:47.915
I'm so sorry, Mr. Maguire.

49:49.515 --> 49:52.186
I'm so sorry for all of this.

49:52.286 --> 49:54.755
He was my best friend.

49:54.855 --> 49:58.325
- I shoulda done something.
- Look at me. Look at me.

50:00.660 --> 50:01.830
Did he suffer?

50:02.330 --> 50:03.997
- Danny?
- Did my boy suffer?

50:04.297 --> 50:09.447
He just kind of went down.
It was real quick.

50:10.604 --> 50:12.682
Thank you.

50:13.641 --> 50:19.238
- It's okay. Come here. It's okay.
- Sorry, I didn't want him to die.

50:39.100 --> 50:43.137
- Did anybody see who killed the cop?
- Witness couldn't identify the shooter.

50:43.237 --> 50:46.807
Conlon and the son were both seen
pulling their weapons.

50:48.042 --> 50:50.310
- They couldn't get to Michael.
- I know.

50:50.610 --> 50:54.248
Jimmy called. He wants to meet
in the old neighborhood.

51:00.187 --> 51:01.188
You need to see this.

51:01.288 --> 51:05.375
<i>A city-wide manhunt is underway tonight
as police search for two suspects</i>

51:05.475 --> 51:08.412
<i>identified as James Conlon
and his son, Michael Conlon,</i>

51:08.512 --> 51:10.881
<i>who they say took the lives
of two police officers</i>

51:10.981 --> 51:13.801
<i>during a deadly chase
on Jamaica Avenue earlier.</i>

51:13.901 --> 51:17.437
<i>We're also getting reports tonight the two
could be linked to a double homicide.</i>

51:17.937 --> 51:20.507
<i>Two bodies were discovered
inside a limousine</i>

51:20.607 --> 51:23.327
<i>believed to have been driven
by Michael Conlon.</i>

51:23.977 --> 51:26.847
- What do you got?
- Just got off with the dispatcher.

51:26.947 --> 51:30.917
Last contact she had with the patrol car
was at 3428 56th Drive.

51:31.017 --> 51:34.289
Officers responded to a report
of a shooting at Michael Conlon's house.

51:34.389 --> 51:38.058
Do you wanna guess who the victim is?
Danny Maguire.

51:38.158 --> 51:42.224
Michael Conlon told the officers
his father was the one who killed him.

51:44.164 --> 51:45.482
- Harding.
- <i>Evening, Detective.</i>

51:45.582 --> 51:48.135
This is Jimmy Conlon.

51:48.235 --> 51:51.717
You got some fuckin' nerve.
You better be on a plane to Shangri-La.

51:51.817 --> 51:53.611
I tried. Flight was full.

51:53.711 --> 51:57.210
I got fifteen witnesses that say
you ran a cop car at Jamaica Avenue

51:57.610 --> 52:01.014
killin' an officer,
while your son killed his partner.

52:02.024 --> 52:05.252
- I killed that cop. Not Michael.
- <i>Bullshit.</i>

52:05.352 --> 52:08.998
<i>If your son's anything like you, he was
probably laughing when he pulled the trigger.</i>

52:09.323 --> 52:11.292
I need your help.

52:12.392 --> 52:16.480
I am the last person on this earth
that you should be asking help from.

52:16.580 --> 52:19.633
You're the only cop I can trust.

52:22.435 --> 52:25.927
- And what's in it for me?
- I'll turn myself in,

52:26.027 --> 52:29.610
confess to killing those cops,
if you agree to help Michael.

52:30.210 --> 52:31.888
<i>I'll die in a prison cell.</i>

52:31.988 --> 52:34.204
That's what you always wanted,
right, Harding?

52:34.304 --> 52:38.002
You're gonna die in a prison cell anyway,
Conlon. There's no way out this time.

52:38.102 --> 52:41.408
And I'm pretty sure that I can find
a witness that says your boy did it.

52:42.595 --> 52:47.278
- Tell me what you want.
- Names. All of them.

52:47.378 --> 52:49.630
Every life you took.
Every family you ruined.

52:50.230 --> 52:52.365
<i>If you give me that...</i>

52:52.465 --> 52:56.070
maybe, fuckin' maybe,
I'll listen to your son.

52:58.447 --> 53:00.174
Not yet. I need to take care
of a few things.

53:00.274 --> 53:02.577
- Turn yourself in.
- You drink coffee, Harding?

53:03.277 --> 53:06.379
Yeah. Six cups a day
for the last thirty years.

53:06.479 --> 53:09.750
Put in a little extra sugar.
It's gonna be a long night.

53:27.971 --> 53:29.470
- Gabby? Where are the girls?
- What happened to your face?

53:29.570 --> 53:31.939
- They're asleep upstairs.
- Hurry up and go pack their stuff.

53:32.539 --> 53:33.707
Why do you have a gun?

53:33.807 --> 53:36.110
Look, Michael, whatever
you're going through, there's a way out.

53:36.210 --> 53:37.978
- Mike. Mike.
- Look, Michael, we get...

53:38.078 --> 53:39.880
- Sit down, Ricky.
- They said you killed two cops.

53:39.980 --> 53:42.516
It's all over the news.
Tell me you didn't do it.

53:42.616 --> 53:45.819
I picked up two clients today,
took 'em to Danny Maguire's house.

53:45.919 --> 53:47.154
And he killed 'em, he shot 'em both,

53:47.254 --> 53:49.389
and then he tried to kill me, too,
'cause I saw him do it.

53:49.889 --> 53:50.911
Did you call the cops?

53:51.011 --> 53:52.878
- It's not that simple.
- What do you mean it's not that simple?

53:52.978 --> 53:56.197
Look, I grew up around this stuff.
I know what these people are capable of.

53:56.908 --> 53:58.732
And now they're comin' after us.

53:59.844 --> 54:01.736
You gotta take the girls and go.

54:02.136 --> 54:04.908
- I'm calling the cops.
- Baby. Baby, baby. Baby.

54:08.083 --> 54:10.587
I'm gonna fix this.

54:10.687 --> 54:12.317
But you gotta trust me.

54:16.255 --> 54:18.885
Okay. You gotta tell 'em
you haven't seen us.

54:18.985 --> 54:22.466
- Do I have to?
- They're not gonna just go away, Ricky.

54:24.157 --> 54:25.892
Open the goddamn door!

54:28.395 --> 54:30.489
Can I help you?

54:33.266 --> 54:35.035
Okay. Come here, sweetie. Come here.

54:35.135 --> 54:38.072
- Where we going, Daddy?
- We're gonna play hide-and-seek.

54:38.272 --> 54:40.816
Where do you think you're goin'?!

54:42.709 --> 54:47.079
Be real quiet, okay?
Uncle Ricky's gonna try to find us.

54:56.573 --> 55:00.431
Can I help you find something
in my house?

55:05.642 --> 55:09.469
- Who was here for dinner?
- Just some work friends.

55:10.971 --> 55:12.806
You always serve your friends
chicken nuggets?

55:12.906 --> 55:15.419
We're on a budget.

55:17.718 --> 55:19.006
Where's your friend?

55:23.049 --> 55:27.089
- I know your sister called.
- What are you, stalking me?

55:32.710 --> 55:35.995
- What did she want?
- She was cooking dinner.

55:41.634 --> 55:44.624
She asked about a recipe.

55:54.881 --> 55:56.912
A recipe?

55:57.434 --> 55:58.754
Chicken nuggets?

56:08.378 --> 56:10.064
I'm calling the cops.

56:12.232 --> 56:14.294
Call 'em now.

56:17.938 --> 56:19.520
Yeah?

56:19.939 --> 56:22.442
Okay. I got it.

56:26.945 --> 56:29.498
Tommy! We gotta go!

56:33.554 --> 56:34.853
Be quiet.

56:45.765 --> 56:47.534
They just left.

56:47.834 --> 56:51.171
It doesn't count! You have to tag me!

57:21.768 --> 57:24.550
Driver, pull over. Turn off the lights.

57:27.506 --> 57:31.045
Anyone gives you shit, your transmission
blew and you're waitin' for a backup.

57:41.587 --> 57:43.057
Hey.

57:43.357 --> 57:46.059
- You want a drink?
- Nah.

57:46.159 --> 57:47.561
Don't make me drink alone.

57:47.661 --> 57:51.892
- Miss, get him a scotch, will you?
- On the rocks.

57:51.992 --> 57:56.336
So I heard you... left Frank
face-down in the subway.

57:56.436 --> 57:59.372
- Frank was an asshole.
- Frank had 15 years and 30 pounds on ya.

57:59.472 --> 58:02.209
- I thought he woulda worn you down.
- So did I.

58:04.778 --> 58:07.447
- <i>Gomez shoots...</i>
- Close game.

58:07.547 --> 58:09.182
<i>Coming up on two minutes to go...</i>

58:09.482 --> 58:13.120
It's gotta be fifteen years since I've been
in here. The place looks different.

58:13.220 --> 58:16.422
All the old places look different now.

58:16.522 --> 58:18.991
Me, Richie Ryan, Mickey Featherstone

58:19.091 --> 58:21.899
would meet every Saturday night
for drinks.

58:21.999 --> 58:23.825
Sit in that back booth, back there.

58:23.925 --> 58:29.533
Yeah, I used to bring Danny here
when he was a boy. Special occasions.

58:29.633 --> 58:32.605
His first communion,
I ordered him a lobster.

58:32.705 --> 58:36.710
Waitress brings it out.
Big as this table. Beautiful, too.

58:36.810 --> 58:39.579
He takes a look at it, and he says,

58:39.679 --> 58:42.490
"do you have any chicken fingers?"

58:45.951 --> 58:47.720
Thanks.

58:47.820 --> 58:49.358
How's Rosie?

58:51.289 --> 58:54.829
Hell of a thing to know you're never gonna
make the woman you love happy again.

59:12.345 --> 59:16.183
I'm here asking
for my son's life, Shawn.

59:16.683 --> 59:19.318
I pulled the trigger. I killed Danny.

59:19.418 --> 59:22.055
You wanna send someone for me,
tell me when.

59:22.155 --> 59:24.524
I'll keep the door open,
I'll put my gun on the table.

59:25.824 --> 59:27.816
Michael...

59:27.916 --> 59:31.698
he's a good kid. He's got a family.
He don't deserve this.

59:31.798 --> 59:34.368
Michael was not gonna talk.
If Danny hadn't shown up...

59:34.468 --> 59:37.805
You think I sent him there? I told him
to stay put. He wouldn't listen.

59:37.905 --> 59:42.409
- He was into some bad shit, Shawn.
- Don't talk to me about my son.

59:47.312 --> 59:50.688
I'm gonna do what I have to do
to protect Michael.

59:50.788 --> 59:52.853
If that means I gotta talk to someone...

59:52.953 --> 59:55.923
- Talk to someone?
- Cops. John Harding.

59:56.223 --> 59:59.926
- The things I know.
- Things that mattered twenty years ago?

01:00:00.026 --> 01:00:03.863
What, you think the feds are parked
outside, listenin' to this conversation?

01:00:03.963 --> 01:00:07.835
Take a look out there. Nobody gives
a shit about what you know anymore.

01:00:08.935 --> 01:00:10.549
Nobody gives a shit about you.

01:00:10.649 --> 01:00:13.407
You die tomorrow, you'd rot away
alone in your bedroom

01:00:13.507 --> 01:00:17.397
until the stench gets so bad the neighbors
got no choice but to call the cops.

01:00:17.497 --> 01:00:20.414
Wouldn't be any point in having a funeral
because no one would come.

01:00:20.814 --> 01:00:23.983
<i>He shoots! Forty seconds to go.
Kick save by Lundqvist.</i>

01:00:24.083 --> 01:00:26.819
I'm the only one ever cared about you.

01:00:26.919 --> 01:00:31.299
And all of that ended an hour ago
when you killed my son.

01:00:34.561 --> 01:00:37.431
I'm comin' after your boy
with everything I got.

01:00:37.831 --> 01:00:40.701
- I won't let you take him, Shawn.
- You got no choice.

01:00:41.601 --> 01:00:44.103
And when it's done, and it will be done,

01:00:44.203 --> 01:00:46.639
you and I are gonna meet
back here at this restaurant,

01:00:46.739 --> 01:00:48.876
at this same table that I used
to share with my boy,

01:00:48.976 --> 01:00:50.082
and I'm gonna look you in the eyes,

01:00:50.182 --> 01:00:53.330
just like you're looking me
in the eyes right now,

01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:57.484
and I'm gonna see how empty they are

01:00:57.584 --> 01:01:00.053
without your son in the world.

01:01:00.853 --> 01:01:03.757
Same thing I saw in my wife's eyes.

01:01:03.857 --> 01:01:06.588
Same thing you're seein' in my eyes.

01:01:06.777 --> 01:01:08.996
And when I see that...

01:01:10.488 --> 01:01:12.991
then I'll let you die.

01:01:14.068 --> 01:01:17.671
<i>Lundqvist couldn't get his stick on it.
And it just missed. Two, one...</i>

01:01:17.771 --> 01:01:23.026
<i>And it is over at the Garden.
The Rangers win it 3-2.</i>

01:01:23.126 --> 01:01:25.292
Thanks for the drink.

01:01:29.382 --> 01:01:31.906
Where do you think you're going?

01:02:07.954 --> 01:02:08.855
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy.

01:02:08.955 --> 01:02:10.990
I left my wallet in my seat.
I'm leaving town tomorrow.

01:02:11.090 --> 01:02:14.227
- I'm screwed without it. Please.
- All right. Take this guy down to his seat.

01:02:14.327 --> 01:02:15.262
- Thanks, pal.
- All right.

01:02:15.362 --> 01:02:18.499
Easy, fellas. Game's over.
No re-entry. Sorry.

01:02:19.399 --> 01:02:21.935
- Sir!
- I got it! Thank you!

01:03:01.674 --> 01:03:03.643
- What'd he say?
- You need to get your family out.

01:03:03.743 --> 01:03:05.987
Remember the cabin I used
to bring you to when you were a boy?

01:03:06.087 --> 01:03:09.488
Up by north-south shore? Take the
throughway all the way up to Haines falls.

01:03:09.588 --> 01:03:10.953
- Yeah.
- You'll be safe there.

01:03:11.353 --> 01:03:12.756
Stay here.

01:03:36.508 --> 01:03:39.513
Yeah, that's... that's Danny.

01:03:42.848 --> 01:03:45.184
That's my son.

01:03:52.091 --> 01:03:53.593
Who's that man, Daddy?

01:03:54.693 --> 01:03:56.731
It's nobody, honey.
Let's get in the car.

01:03:59.732 --> 01:04:03.302
- You know where you're going?
- I'll find it.

01:04:04.704 --> 01:04:08.942
Hey, babe. Look at me.
It's gonna be okay. Go.

01:04:09.342 --> 01:04:11.978
What're you doing? Get in the car.

01:04:12.178 --> 01:04:15.515
- If I run now, I'll never stop running.
- Michael. You have to leave the city.

01:04:15.615 --> 01:04:17.381
There's this kid I train
down at the boxing gym.

01:04:17.481 --> 01:04:20.140
He was with me in the car
at Danny's house. He saw everything.

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:22.918
Can you keep me alive
long enough to get to him?

01:04:23.018 --> 01:04:24.824
I'll drive.

01:04:37.336 --> 01:04:39.891
Get me Price.

01:04:43.008 --> 01:04:45.445
So you keep in touch
with your mom's side of the family?

01:04:45.845 --> 01:04:48.081
What, you're the big
family supporter now?

01:04:48.481 --> 01:04:51.617
Listen, I came home a few times.
Your mom and I tried to work things out.

01:04:51.717 --> 01:04:54.354
The only time you ever came home
was when you needed a place to lay low.

01:04:54.454 --> 01:04:57.123
And I'd find a gun
hidden in every room in the house.

01:04:57.523 --> 01:05:01.028
And I'd be scared to death
that you'd end up like cousin Billy.

01:05:06.898 --> 01:05:09.703
- This is Price.
- <i>I got a job for you.</i>

01:05:10.103 --> 01:05:14.040
Two people. I'll double your quote.
But it's gotta be done by the morning.

01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:17.644
They killed two cops and a couple
of squarehead gangsters in Queens.

01:05:17.744 --> 01:05:21.881
The whole city's huntin' 'em down.
I need you to get there first.

01:05:22.181 --> 01:05:23.482
What are their names?

01:05:25.005 --> 01:05:27.453
Michael and Jimmy Conlon.

01:05:27.553 --> 01:05:30.323
- <i>You're fuckin' with me, right?</i>
- You want the job or not?

01:05:30.423 --> 01:05:34.527
<i>Conlon? I'll kill
that motherfucker for free.</i>

01:05:35.127 --> 01:05:38.426
Just make sure his son dies first.

01:05:39.699 --> 01:05:43.737
Your next one, is it a...
a boy or a girl?

01:05:44.337 --> 01:05:45.962
A boy.

01:05:46.062 --> 01:05:48.774
Boy? Got a name picked out?

01:05:48.874 --> 01:05:50.748
Yeah.

01:05:57.018 --> 01:05:59.185
You like what you do,
driving a limo around?

01:05:59.285 --> 01:06:01.854
Sure. I do cartwheels on my way
out the door every night.

01:06:01.954 --> 01:06:02.923
That bad?

01:06:03.023 --> 01:06:04.857
Since when do you give a shit
if I'm happy?

01:06:04.957 --> 01:06:08.227
This is for your own sake, right? I say
I'm happy, that life turned out all right

01:06:08.327 --> 01:06:10.163
and then you don't feel
so guilty about leaving.

01:06:10.263 --> 01:06:11.965
- That's right.
- Yeah.

01:06:12.065 --> 01:06:14.566
So, are you?

01:06:14.873 --> 01:06:16.937
I'd be happier
if I were still fightin', but...

01:06:17.037 --> 01:06:20.707
- I used to watch your fights.
- That's fuckin' bullshit.

01:06:20.807 --> 01:06:23.543
Over on Church Street.
I'd stand in the tunnel.

01:06:23.643 --> 01:06:26.547
I was there when you lost to Ramirez.

01:06:26.647 --> 01:06:29.349
You didn't have the killer instinct
to make a top-class fighter, Mike.

01:06:29.449 --> 01:06:32.184
- I got fucked by the judges.
- The judges didn't fuck you.

01:06:32.384 --> 01:06:35.288
You were ahead at the end of the fourth,
and you stopped using your jab.

01:06:35.588 --> 01:06:38.391
You could've made the rankings
if you'd've used that jab more.

01:06:38.491 --> 01:06:40.460
That's life.
It don't offer any do-overs.

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:43.663
Believe me, I know. Otherwise,
I would've put in for one a long time ago.

01:06:43.763 --> 01:06:47.133
- You've got a lot of anger in you.
- Wouldn't you? With you as a father?

01:06:47.533 --> 01:06:51.237
Because I left? You got it backwards.

01:06:51.337 --> 01:06:53.907
The things I did, the things I seen...

01:06:54.007 --> 01:06:58.277
it becomes who you are.
You can't just go home and scrub it off.

01:06:58.377 --> 01:07:00.881
The only way I could protect you
was to walk away.

01:07:00.981 --> 01:07:02.983
Forget about you and your mom.

01:07:03.083 --> 01:07:06.487
I wanted a better life for you
than the one I chose for myself.

01:07:10.221 --> 01:07:12.115
That's it.

01:07:19.364 --> 01:07:21.901
I'm sorry, Michael.

01:08:23.663 --> 01:08:27.133
Hey. You know this kid called Legs?
You know where he lives?

01:08:28.831 --> 01:08:30.286
- Building three.
- Which apartment?

01:08:30.386 --> 01:08:33.408
- What do I look like, Google maps?
- Thanks.

01:08:35.541 --> 01:08:37.276
His name's Curtis Banks.

01:08:37.376 --> 01:08:41.180
- You know, his mom works as a nurse.
- No, sorry.

01:08:44.282 --> 01:08:46.018
- Yeah?
- I'm lookin' for Legs.

01:08:46.118 --> 01:08:49.386
Yeah. Me too. Preferably spread.

01:08:57.930 --> 01:08:58.988
Hello?

01:09:06.638 --> 01:09:10.826
- <i>911. What's your emergency?</i>
- Yes. The bad guys that was on the TV?

01:09:10.926 --> 01:09:13.430
- They're outside the door.
- <i>Just hold the line.</i>

01:09:23.756 --> 01:09:28.493
<i>All units respond to a code one. Positive
I.D. on the I-278 shooting suspects.</i>

01:09:28.594 --> 01:09:31.607
<i>648 Park Avenue,
Marcy Houses, building three.</i>

01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:41.731
Hi. I'm lookin' for this kid
called Curtis Banks?

01:09:50.316 --> 01:09:52.519
Open the door, please.

01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:56.923
- He not ready. He not ready.
- No, you not ready.

01:09:57.023 --> 01:10:00.025
- Terrell is gettin' his ass beat.
- Boy, you see!

01:10:00.543 --> 01:10:03.973
Yo, go get the door. Hurry up.

01:10:04.197 --> 01:10:05.065
Yeah?

01:10:05.165 --> 01:10:07.687
- I'm lookin' for this kid Legs, or Curtis.
- Who are you?

01:10:07.787 --> 01:10:09.333
It doesn't matter who we are.
Do you know him or not?

01:10:09.433 --> 01:10:11.804
Sorry, but my mom told me
not to talk to creepy-ass old men.

01:10:11.904 --> 01:10:15.158
Hey. You. I seen you before.
Down at the boxing gym.

01:10:15.258 --> 01:10:18.310
- You know Legs, right?
- Yeah, that's my brother. Is he okay?

01:10:18.410 --> 01:10:19.946
I need to get ahold of him.
It's really important.

01:10:20.046 --> 01:10:22.015
He's not answering his phone.
Where would he go?

01:10:22.115 --> 01:10:24.783
- I don't know.
- Well, think.

01:10:30.189 --> 01:10:33.367
I need you to tell your brother
that Mike needs his help.

01:10:35.962 --> 01:10:38.699
- It's really important.
- All right.

01:10:47.072 --> 01:10:50.274
- <i>Let's go!</i>
- We gotta get out of here.

01:10:50.374 --> 01:10:54.380
It's a big building.
We've got some time. Let's wait.

01:11:17.837 --> 01:11:19.639
<i>We're looking for a white male,
in his thirties...</i>

01:11:19.739 --> 01:11:23.375
- Anybody in there?
- Open the door, please.

01:11:26.011 --> 01:11:28.648
- Let's go. Everybody out.
- Come on, folks. Let's go.

01:11:30.049 --> 01:11:32.452
Police! We need to evacuate
this building.

01:11:33.652 --> 01:11:35.665
Everybody out!

01:11:41.694 --> 01:11:44.230
Copy that. I'm covering the southeast...
Sir! You can't be back here.

01:11:44.330 --> 01:11:47.833
You don't understand. My mom lives
in this building. She's having chest pains.

01:11:47.933 --> 01:11:50.075
There's two fugitives hiding in the building.
I'm not allowed to let anyone in.

01:11:50.175 --> 01:11:52.875
Could you check on her for me?

01:11:52.977 --> 01:11:56.576
- What's her apartment number?
- 317. I have the keys right here.

01:12:04.683 --> 01:12:07.688
- Two tactical units are heading inside now.
- And you're sure Conlon's in there?

01:12:07.788 --> 01:12:10.156
Why do you think I saved you
a front-row seat?

01:12:20.165 --> 01:12:21.768
Open up! Police!

01:12:31.611 --> 01:12:32.511
Shit.

01:12:32.611 --> 01:12:35.114
- What's goin' on?
- Now's our chance.

01:12:37.683 --> 01:12:39.252
Let's move.

01:12:51.364 --> 01:12:53.966
Fools are in there! He's got a gun!

01:12:54.166 --> 01:12:57.103
- Get back! Get back!
- Move! Freeze!

01:12:58.489 --> 01:13:00.324
Freeze!

01:13:02.658 --> 01:13:05.093
<i>Targets are on the twelfth floor,
headin' down the west stairwell.</i>

01:13:05.193 --> 01:13:07.719
<i>Repeat, twelfth floor.</i>

01:13:16.722 --> 01:13:18.725
Let's go! Let's clear 'em out!

01:13:25.431 --> 01:13:29.486
<i>Shots fired in the west stairwell.
Two officers down!</i>

01:13:35.692 --> 01:13:38.272
Holy shit!

01:13:42.281 --> 01:13:46.352
<i>Attention. An emergency
has been reported in this building.</i>

01:13:46.452 --> 01:13:51.242
<i>Repeat: Do not use elevators.
Please leave the building.</i>

01:13:51.342 --> 01:13:53.360
We gotta get everybody
outta this building now!

01:13:57.295 --> 01:14:00.096
This is some bullshit.

01:14:03.102 --> 01:14:04.671
Shit.

01:14:06.278 --> 01:14:09.341
Easy does it. Okay.

01:14:09.890 --> 01:14:11.897
Move!

01:14:13.112 --> 01:14:15.048
<i>Do not use elevators.</i>

01:14:17.249 --> 01:14:19.416
Shit! He's got a gun!

01:14:20.653 --> 01:14:23.422
<i>Please leave the building, utilizing...</i>

01:14:27.659 --> 01:14:29.988
You ever wanna see your family
again, leave. Leave now.

01:14:30.088 --> 01:14:32.465
- Who was that?
- He's a professional killer.

01:14:32.565 --> 01:14:35.398
He won't stop until we're all dead.

01:14:36.938 --> 01:14:39.456
Go, Mike. Go!

01:14:41.738 --> 01:14:45.577
Hey! Price! Come on, you fucker!

01:14:48.923 --> 01:14:51.318
Come on, Price! You dumb fuck!

01:16:41.459 --> 01:16:43.446
Don't do it, Michael.

01:16:45.364 --> 01:16:46.799
Don't do it!

01:16:49.634 --> 01:16:50.803
- Don't fuckin' move!
- Let's go!

01:16:50.903 --> 01:16:52.972
- Police!
- Freeze! On the ground!

01:16:57.276 --> 01:16:58.705
All right, we're comin' down.

01:17:04.449 --> 01:17:06.122
Conlon!

01:17:06.222 --> 01:17:08.287
Conlon! Stay there, Conlon!

01:17:12.558 --> 01:17:15.196
Goddamn it, Conlon!

01:17:17.796 --> 01:17:19.944
Conlon!

01:17:24.769 --> 01:17:26.305
Stay back.

01:17:26.405 --> 01:17:28.006
Conlon!

01:17:28.106 --> 01:17:30.576
- Come on.
- Hey! Jesus, Conlon.

01:17:30.676 --> 01:17:33.379
Come back up. Come on.
I'll give you a hand.

01:17:38.450 --> 01:17:40.185
They're inside on the ground floor!

01:17:41.821 --> 01:17:43.978
I want them in custody.

01:17:44.523 --> 01:17:46.012
Easy. Easy.

01:17:48.661 --> 01:17:52.999
- <i>Get on the ground! Put your hands up!</i>
- <i>Suspects heading north toward the rail yard.</i>

01:17:53.099 --> 01:17:55.971
<i>We have the area surrounded!</i>

01:18:01.974 --> 01:18:03.915
Get on the ground!

01:18:05.177 --> 01:18:06.846
Freeze!

01:18:07.446 --> 01:18:09.882
Don't fuckin' move!

01:18:09.982 --> 01:18:11.850
Hold it right there!

01:18:11.950 --> 01:18:13.556
<i>Eyes on the suspects.</i>

01:18:13.656 --> 01:18:16.423
<i>Headed to the east quadrant!</i>

01:18:18.090 --> 01:18:19.310
<i>I lost visual.</i>

01:18:21.125 --> 01:18:25.031
<i>Conlon, it's Harding.
It's over. Do ya hear me?</i>

01:18:26.347 --> 01:18:28.867
<i>You gotta surrender.</i>

01:18:34.729 --> 01:18:37.025
<i>That's it. We're comin' in.</i>

01:18:47.251 --> 01:18:48.521
He's not in here.

01:18:48.921 --> 01:18:51.571
Is he fuckin' here?!

01:18:58.429 --> 01:19:00.939
You can't ever pull that trigger.
You understand me?

01:19:01.039 --> 01:19:03.469
You pull that trigger,
you're no better than I am.

01:19:03.669 --> 01:19:06.539
We get everybody to go back
to the edge of the perimeter,

01:19:06.639 --> 01:19:09.241
and we work our way back in.

01:19:09.341 --> 01:19:12.406
We'll go to your uncle Eddie's house.
Come on.

01:19:57.722 --> 01:19:59.191
- Hey, uncle Eddie.
- Michael.

01:19:59.291 --> 01:20:01.129
Just pull the sleeve.

01:20:07.799 --> 01:20:09.806
I got it.

01:20:19.432 --> 01:20:21.380
Don't wipe off the tattoo.

01:20:23.582 --> 01:20:24.883
Thanks.

01:20:25.183 --> 01:20:26.886
There you go.

01:20:27.599 --> 01:20:29.821
What the hell happened to you?

01:20:29.921 --> 01:20:32.959
We were jumped. Over on Bedford Avenue.

01:20:33.059 --> 01:20:36.108
One of 'em had a knife this long.

01:20:36.528 --> 01:20:39.282
Took my wallet, too.

01:20:39.382 --> 01:20:41.400
Where's Mom? Is she asleep?

01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:45.303
Mom... is in the hospital again.

01:20:45.403 --> 01:20:48.734
- Jesus Christ.
- Yeah.

01:20:52.750 --> 01:20:55.747
What you got yourself into now, Jimmy?

01:20:55.847 --> 01:20:58.250
It's been all over TV. All night long.

01:20:58.350 --> 01:21:02.021
Showin' your picture. Cops come here.
Asking me, have I seen you?

01:21:02.121 --> 01:21:05.622
Do I know where you guys are,
both of yous?

01:21:05.722 --> 01:21:08.304
So, what's going on?

01:21:09.127 --> 01:21:13.164
I'll need your car.
Mike and I need to lay low for a while.

01:21:13.494 --> 01:21:17.837
It wasn't enough that you ruined
your own fuckin' life?

01:21:17.937 --> 01:21:20.606
Now you're gonna bring Michael
into this?

01:21:20.706 --> 01:21:23.611
I'm not bringing Michael into anything.
I'm trying to get him out.

01:21:23.711 --> 01:21:28.213
- Who you running from this time?
- Shawn Maguire.

01:21:29.013 --> 01:21:30.860
I killed his son.

01:21:31.616 --> 01:21:33.438
I killed Danny.

01:21:36.822 --> 01:21:38.724
Get the fuck out of my house!

01:21:39.224 --> 01:21:40.058
Get the fuck out of here!

01:21:40.158 --> 01:21:41.899
It's not his fault this time.
He's trying to get me out of this.

01:21:41.999 --> 01:21:44.630
No, he's not trying to get you
out of this, Michael. He's not.

01:21:44.730 --> 01:21:48.600
He's only loyal to one person.
He's gonna turn you over to Shawn.

01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:50.669
I'm his son. He's not gonna
turn me over to Shawn.

01:21:50.769 --> 01:21:54.540
He killed his own cousin
for Shawn Maguire.

01:21:55.740 --> 01:21:59.345
- What the fuck you talkin' about?
- I'm talking about your cousin Billy.

01:22:03.515 --> 01:22:07.853
No. Roy Demeo's guys killed Billy.
Everybody knows that.

01:22:07.953 --> 01:22:11.812
For God's sake, Jimmy.
Tell your son the truth.

01:22:13.792 --> 01:22:15.594
<i>Billy had problems.</i>

01:22:15.694 --> 01:22:18.530
<i>Yeah. Sure. Billy had problems.</i>

01:22:18.630 --> 01:22:20.966
<i>He couldn't quite quit the dope.</i>

01:22:21.066 --> 01:22:23.903
<i>Billy used to follow Jimmy
and Shawn around everywhere.</i>

01:22:24.203 --> 01:22:27.472
<i>He thought they were some kind
of goddamn heroes.</i>

01:22:27.572 --> 01:22:31.476
<i>And then the night he got pinched,
the D.A. wanted him to rat out Shawn.</i>

01:22:31.576 --> 01:22:34.076
<i>Otherwise, they were gonna
lock him up for ten years.</i>

01:22:34.176 --> 01:22:38.884
<i>And he's just a kid, and he's scared
to death. And he was gonna talk.</i>

01:22:38.984 --> 01:22:43.822
But Jimmy, he wasn't gonna let
that happen. Were you, Jimmy?

01:22:49.394 --> 01:22:52.598
I had to tell the boy.
He can't trust you.

01:22:53.398 --> 01:22:54.917
Mike!

01:22:55.017 --> 01:22:57.566
Mike! Wait!

01:22:58.403 --> 01:23:01.473
Michael. Wait. Michael!

01:23:09.781 --> 01:23:11.556
Here.

01:23:11.656 --> 01:23:14.853
Whose side are you gonna choose
this time, Jimmy?

01:23:33.303 --> 01:23:34.707
E.R.

01:23:34.807 --> 01:23:37.342
Yeah, Cheryl's off tonight.

01:23:57.229 --> 01:23:58.624
Ma.

01:24:14.379 --> 01:24:16.047
Ma.

01:25:38.629 --> 01:25:42.200
- We heard from Price?
- Not yet.

01:25:53.678 --> 01:25:56.548
- Is it done?
- <i>Not yet, Shawn.</i>

01:25:56.648 --> 01:25:59.819
I'm giving you one more chance
to walk away from this.

01:26:02.097 --> 01:26:05.957
- You're giving me one more chance?
- <i>That's right.</i>

01:26:06.057 --> 01:26:09.938
As long as you're comin' after Michael,
I'm comin' after you.

01:26:10.038 --> 01:26:14.433
- <i>Walk away, Shawn.</i>
- Walk away to what, Jimmy?

01:26:15.414 --> 01:26:17.336
Ain't got nothing left
to walk back to anymore.

01:26:17.936 --> 01:26:20.572
This is between you and me.
Leave my son out of it.

01:26:20.672 --> 01:26:21.991
Fuck you.

01:26:25.109 --> 01:26:27.145
Then we do like you always said.

01:26:27.645 --> 01:26:31.511
We cross that line together. Right now.

01:26:47.399 --> 01:26:49.301
Tell everyone to get ready.

01:26:50.101 --> 01:26:52.027
Jimmy's comin'.

01:26:58.276 --> 01:27:01.247
- I'll take another, Terry.
- All right. One sec.

01:27:01.647 --> 01:27:02.681
Hey, Terry.

01:27:16.830 --> 01:27:18.270
You fuckin'...

01:27:44.156 --> 01:27:46.179
Drop it.

01:27:50.494 --> 01:27:52.998
Open the door. Come on. Move.

01:30:33.757 --> 01:30:36.962
Been a long night, Jimmy?

01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:39.811
Yeah.

01:30:41.944 --> 01:30:45.102
Growin' up, all we wanted
was to be like those guys

01:30:45.202 --> 01:30:48.605
we saw walkin' down
to their social clubs on tenth Avenue.

01:30:48.705 --> 01:30:51.009
Now look at us.

01:30:52.009 --> 01:30:55.481
I never wanted to be like those guys.

01:30:55.581 --> 01:30:59.151
All I wanted was to be like you, Shawn.

01:31:00.091 --> 01:31:03.120
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

01:32:32.877 --> 01:32:35.080
Shawn. Stop.

01:32:38.715 --> 01:32:41.269
Come on, Shawn.

01:33:44.248 --> 01:33:46.175
Ji...

01:34:38.069 --> 01:34:39.331
We got a walk-in.

01:34:39.431 --> 01:34:43.136
Young kid. Says he's got information
about Mike Conlon.

01:34:55.819 --> 01:34:57.118
<i>Get down!</i>

01:34:57.855 --> 01:34:59.490
Why didn't you bring this to me earlier?

01:34:59.690 --> 01:35:02.126
I thought they killed Mike
and maybe they were comin' after me.

01:35:02.426 --> 01:35:04.434
My little brother found me
at my friend's place

01:35:04.534 --> 01:35:07.632
and told me that Mike came by the apartment
and said he was in trouble.

01:35:07.732 --> 01:35:10.268
So... that's why I'm here.

01:35:10.368 --> 01:35:12.270
Can you tell me how you know Mike again?

01:35:12.370 --> 01:35:14.672
Trains me down at the gym on fourth ave.

01:35:14.772 --> 01:35:18.277
They... they got a program for kids
who don't got dads.

01:35:20.577 --> 01:35:22.105
He's my mentor.

01:35:24.832 --> 01:35:26.517
All right. Sit tight.
I'll be right back.

01:35:26.617 --> 01:35:28.686
Call ballistics. Tell 'em to check
Danny Maguire's gun.

01:35:28.786 --> 01:35:31.556
See if it matches the bullets
in the Albanians the patrol found earlier.

01:35:31.656 --> 01:35:33.424
- All right. Got it.
- Call for you, Harding. Line two.

01:35:33.524 --> 01:35:35.827
- Tell 'em I left for the night.
- It's Michael Conlon.

01:35:36.127 --> 01:35:38.548
Says he wants to turn himself in.

01:35:42.766 --> 01:35:43.807
Michael.

01:35:53.544 --> 01:35:56.915
- I won the first round, so...
- You won the first round?

01:35:57.015 --> 01:35:58.349
Green!

01:35:58.449 --> 01:36:00.752
Catching up to me.

01:36:10.361 --> 01:36:11.309
You lose!

01:36:16.433 --> 01:36:18.155
I'm getting over here.

01:36:19.544 --> 01:36:23.441
What the fuck are you doin' here?
Cops are on their way.

01:36:23.741 --> 01:36:25.627
I'd get the hell out of here,
if I were you.

01:36:25.727 --> 01:36:27.698
I'm too old to run.

01:36:29.183 --> 01:36:32.053
Where the hell would I go anyway?

01:36:32.783 --> 01:36:34.318
It's over, Michael.

01:36:35.018 --> 01:36:38.323
You and your family don't have to worry
about Shawn no more.

01:36:38.923 --> 01:36:42.793
When the cops get here, I'll tell them
everything they wanna hear.

01:36:42.893 --> 01:36:45.798
That you... didn't have
any part in all this.

01:36:49.099 --> 01:36:52.370
You mi... you mind if I wait inside?

01:36:54.370 --> 01:36:56.908
The girls are still in there.

01:36:57.822 --> 01:37:00.678
Yeah. Right.

01:37:06.017 --> 01:37:08.519
It's nice to finally meet you.
I'm Gabriela.

01:37:10.043 --> 01:37:11.962
Hi.

01:37:13.223 --> 01:37:15.910
Nice to meet you, too, Gabriela.

01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:17.361
Why don't we go inside.

01:37:17.461 --> 01:37:19.431
- Babe.
- Let's go inside.

01:37:26.604 --> 01:37:28.579
Okay.

01:37:33.210 --> 01:37:34.646
Girls?

01:37:36.471 --> 01:37:40.156
Girls. This is your grandfather.

01:37:41.118 --> 01:37:42.570
Hi. My name's Catelyn.

01:37:42.670 --> 01:37:47.275
Well, hi, Catelyn. I'm Jimmy.
Nice to meet ya. You're a pretty girl.

01:37:47.375 --> 01:37:50.227
Why were you standing
by my house earlier?

01:37:53.539 --> 01:37:54.674
I was waitin' on your dad.

01:37:54.774 --> 01:37:56.617
- Did you get all wet?
- Oh, just a little.

01:37:56.717 --> 01:37:58.736
Wanna say hi to your grandfather?

01:37:59.036 --> 01:38:03.111
- Could we go feed the ducks now, Mommy?
- Come on. Let's go put your coats on.

01:38:11.148 --> 01:38:12.917
- Okay, Lily, you got the bread?
- Yep.

01:38:13.017 --> 01:38:15.019
- You're gonna hold on to it?
- Got it!

01:38:15.119 --> 01:38:17.954
You have to give some
to your sister, too, okay?

01:38:18.054 --> 01:38:21.426
- No, I won't eat it.
- Let's go.

01:38:21.526 --> 01:38:24.478
- I'm gonna go and keep 'em busy.
- Okay. All right.

01:38:24.578 --> 01:38:26.865
I don't want the girls to be here
when the cops come around.

01:38:26.965 --> 01:38:29.790
Yeah. Yeah, they shouldn't see that.

01:38:33.838 --> 01:38:35.860
Goodbye, Michael.

01:38:50.354 --> 01:38:52.657
- Duckie.
- Remember to walk really slowly, okay?

01:38:52.757 --> 01:38:55.056
You don't want to scare them.

01:40:13.538 --> 01:40:15.605
You okay?

01:40:17.508 --> 01:40:19.475
Roll...

01:40:22.016 --> 01:40:23.715
I gotta go back up there.

01:40:26.183 --> 01:40:28.286
It's for me.

01:40:28.386 --> 01:40:31.458
- Okay.
- I'll be right back.

01:40:53.644 --> 01:40:55.614
- Get the girls out of here.
- Come on, let's go.

01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:25.373
Stay quiet, honey. Stay quiet.

01:41:39.289 --> 01:41:40.691
Oh, God.

01:42:32.243 --> 01:42:35.813
Where's Daddy? I'm scared.

01:42:41.752 --> 01:42:44.167
It's okay, honey.
You have to be quiet-quiet.

01:43:54.228 --> 01:43:56.279
Gabriela, run!

01:45:43.534 --> 01:45:46.594
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

01:46:18.061 --> 01:46:19.092
Dad?

01:46:21.074 --> 01:46:22.935
Dad?

01:46:37.081 --> 01:46:39.949
Mike! Put that gun down!

01:46:40.049 --> 01:46:42.860
- I'm innocent! I didn't do anything!
- I know. I know.

01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:44.978
I need you to put the gun down.

01:47:02.719 --> 01:47:05.996
Get on the outside, Legs.
Get on the outside.

01:47:06.096 --> 01:47:08.151
Get off the ropes, Legs.
Get off the ropes.

01:47:08.251 --> 01:47:10.585
There you go. Roll to the left.
Get outta there.

01:47:10.685 --> 01:47:13.999
Check him with a jab. There you go.
There you go. Quick feet.

01:47:14.591 --> 01:47:17.561
- Yes!
- Two! Three!

01:47:17.661 --> 01:47:20.397
- He's done.
- Four! Five! It's over!

01:47:20.697 --> 01:47:24.735
That's what I'm talking about.
Beautiful! Now get in the middle.

01:47:29.974 --> 01:47:32.042
You're gonna get a big, big sugar rush.

01:47:32.142 --> 01:47:35.049
Take the nose. Put that there,
like this. There you go.

01:47:35.149 --> 01:47:37.314
- What's that supposed to be, Cate?
- Frosty the snowman, duh.

01:47:37.414 --> 01:47:40.051
- Duh! What about you, sweetheart?
- Rudolph the reindeer.

01:47:40.151 --> 01:47:43.454
- He's so pretty I might have to take a bite.
- No, Daddy! It's mine!

01:47:43.554 --> 01:47:46.156
Okay, I won't do anything.

01:47:46.256 --> 01:47:50.164
- I gotta go get ready for work.
- Don't take all of them.
