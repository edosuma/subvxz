WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:04.792
(Man)
Previously on Mech-X4...

00:04.875 --> 00:07.875
(Woman)
Mech-X4 has cost me two monsters.

00:07.959 --> 00:10.667
The only loose end was Jaguasaur's
primorphous core.

00:10.750 --> 00:14.458
Let's hope they're foolish
enough to try and open it.

00:15.917 --> 00:18.083
Hey!
You are Seth Harper.

00:21.792 --> 00:22.917
Why did it hurt?

00:23.000 --> 00:24.750
You are bonded
to this robot.

00:24.834 --> 00:26.792
Get the primorphous core back?

00:26.875 --> 00:28.875
Something even better.

00:28.959 --> 00:30.333
Ryan Walker.

00:43.834 --> 00:45.375
(Harris) Oh, hey, Ryan!
Check this out!

00:45.458 --> 00:47.041
I'm trying to create
a weapon in the chest.

00:47.125 --> 00:48.959
I thought we could use something
more powerful after

00:49.041 --> 00:50.583
we got our butts kicked by Clawboon.

01:04.250 --> 01:06.166
(hammering)

01:09.959 --> 01:11.834
I shocked myself.

01:11.917 --> 01:13.250
Pretty cool.

01:13.333 --> 01:19.125
(indistinct chatter echoing)

01:20.959 --> 01:23.458
Everyone shut it
for like three seconds!

01:23.542 --> 01:26.709
-You okay?
-Yeah.

01:26.792 --> 01:28.542
No, yeah, I don't... I don't know.

01:28.625 --> 01:32.000
I'm sorry. I have all these people
depending on me.

01:32.083 --> 01:34.417
And I've been having
all these flashbacks.

01:34.500 --> 01:37.333
I have to go from zero to, like,
kicking monster butt

01:37.417 --> 01:38.583
in six seconds...

01:38.667 --> 01:39.834
Wow, feeling the pressure?

01:39.917 --> 01:41.625
You know what I do
when that happens to me?

01:41.709 --> 01:43.250
I do something just for me.

01:43.333 --> 01:45.583
Like this weekend,
DJ Live-Rat$z is spinning.

01:45.667 --> 01:47.834
No way. You got tickets for that?
I thought it sold out.

01:47.917 --> 01:50.166
Dude, I'm Mark Walker.

01:53.375 --> 01:54.667
Dane!

01:55.834 --> 01:57.875
Hey, you get extra tickets
to DJ Live-Rat$z?

01:57.959 --> 01:59.917
(Dane)
(laughing)

02:00.000 --> 02:01.500
Dude, why are you laughing?

02:04.041 --> 02:06.625
Hey, Mark might be right
about the pressure.

02:06.709 --> 02:08.000
You should do
something fun.

02:08.083 --> 02:10.083
Weren't you gonna sign up
for this skate competition?

02:10.166 --> 02:12.000
Yeah, but...

02:12.083 --> 02:14.250
after all the monsters
and the conspiracy,

02:14.333 --> 02:15.375
it's kind of hard.

02:15.458 --> 02:16.750
Well, we all do things
to relax.

02:16.834 --> 02:18.333
Mark hangs out.
I invent.

02:18.417 --> 02:19.709
And I plan weddings.

02:19.792 --> 02:21.792
Terrible, terrible weddings.

02:22.792 --> 02:25.291
You skate. So skate, son!

02:27.542 --> 02:28.834
Yeah.

02:31.500 --> 02:33.041
I just got a hit
on the Walker kid.

02:33.125 --> 02:35.875
He entered something
called the "Bay City Skate-Off."

02:35.959 --> 02:37.458
So, waste him before
he gets there?

02:37.542 --> 02:39.750
No. We just watch him.

02:41.875 --> 02:45.417
Three pilots.
He must have partners.

02:45.500 --> 02:48.125
I want to know exactly
who they are.

02:48.208 --> 02:50.208
And where that robot is.

02:50.291 --> 02:51.583
And after that?

02:52.792 --> 02:55.417
Then we get rid of
all of them.

02:59.667 --> 03:00.917
(theme music playing)

03:23.041 --> 03:24.875
Okay.
Show it to me again.

03:25.750 --> 03:27.166
That the trick
you wanna do?

03:29.917 --> 03:31.792
It's the trick
I got to beat, okay?

03:31.875 --> 03:33.125
That's Jimmy Wilson,

03:33.208 --> 03:34.834
he's the winner
of the Bay City Skate-off

03:34.917 --> 03:35.834
three years running.

03:35.917 --> 03:37.417
-He's good.
-I know.

03:37.500 --> 03:39.333
-I mean, like, really good...
-I know!

03:39.417 --> 03:40.583
Okay, look,

03:40.667 --> 03:41.625
try the trick again.

03:41.709 --> 03:43.667
But when you do,
you've got to crouch low

03:43.750 --> 03:45.166
when you...
what's the word?

03:45.250 --> 03:46.709
Grind the rail?

03:46.792 --> 03:48.583
Wait, I thought you were working
on the "X" weapon.

03:48.667 --> 03:49.709
I am.

03:49.792 --> 03:52.333
Plus, I designed an app
that scans news feeds

03:52.417 --> 03:54.667
for monsters and can
send us an alert.

03:54.750 --> 03:56.875
I have to do multiple things
at the same time.

03:56.959 --> 03:58.458
My brain is a curse.

04:00.625 --> 04:02.083
-You ready to do this?
-Yeah.

04:02.166 --> 04:03.583
-You're gonna hit that rail?
-Uh-huh.

04:03.667 --> 04:05.667
Okay, let's do this.

04:05.750 --> 04:06.959
Ready, Ry-guy?

04:07.041 --> 04:08.750
-Yeah, I got it.
-Go, man.

04:24.417 --> 04:25.792
(Ryan)
Whoa, what is that?

04:28.875 --> 04:29.959
What?

04:33.750 --> 04:35.250
(Harris)
Gravity pucks?

04:35.417 --> 04:37.834
And... a bounce belt?

04:37.917 --> 04:39.583
And whatever this is!

04:39.667 --> 04:40.959
What do you think
it does?

04:42.458 --> 04:43.709
It's a wrench.

04:43.792 --> 04:45.750
That you can hit
things with!

04:45.834 --> 04:47.625
This robot's got
everything!

04:48.625 --> 04:49.750
You know what?

04:49.834 --> 04:51.458
I could definitely use
this stuff to, you know,

04:51.542 --> 04:52.875
-build the X weapon.
-Nice.

04:52.959 --> 04:55.917
And I've got a belt,
which is awesome,

04:56.000 --> 04:58.542
'cause I lost the last one
when I mooned a bus of kids.

04:58.625 --> 04:59.792
Why would you...?

04:59.875 --> 05:01.709
That's styling.

05:03.709 --> 05:04.792
-Spyder!
-Spyder!

05:04.875 --> 05:05.959
(Spyder)
I'm fine.

05:06.041 --> 05:07.625
-(Spyder) This is...
-Oh.

05:07.709 --> 05:09.083
a force-field belt!

05:09.166 --> 05:10.417
(Spyder laughing)

05:10.500 --> 05:12.375
I'm gonna go
back to skateboarding. Yeah.

05:12.458 --> 05:14.625
Okay, and I'm gonna go put
a door over that.

05:14.709 --> 05:16.667
(Spyder moaning)

05:16.750 --> 05:18.208
Oh, wow, this robot is big!

05:22.834 --> 05:25.166
'Sup? It's Mark Walker.

05:25.250 --> 05:27.709
Hey, you got tickets
to the DJ Live-Rat$z?

05:27.792 --> 05:29.542
(person laughing)

05:32.959 --> 05:35.333
All right, leftovers.
Heal my pain.

05:35.417 --> 05:38.041
-I'm starving.
-â€¦(indistinctive) workin' on TV,

05:38.125 --> 05:39.959
-which I didn't think was possible.
-Really?

05:41.792 --> 05:42.959
Hey. You're here.

05:43.041 --> 05:45.125
Hey, we ordered
way too much sushi.

05:45.208 --> 05:46.417
You want some?

05:48.166 --> 05:49.917
Nope. Not hungry.

05:52.625 --> 05:54.542
Be nice. I like him.

05:56.375 --> 05:57.542
Fine.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.959
Live-Rat$z, huh?
You going to that?

06:01.041 --> 06:02.792
Everybody's going to that.
Except for me.

06:02.875 --> 06:05.625
I couldn't get tickets
because I was doing...

06:05.709 --> 06:07.667
wait, why am I
telling you anything?

06:07.750 --> 06:10.083
You know, I could get you
into that show.

06:10.166 --> 06:11.333
By throwing
your wallet at it?

06:11.417 --> 06:13.125
I can't just throw
my wallet around.

06:13.208 --> 06:15.125
It's really heavy.

06:17.375 --> 06:20.041
Okay, your money might
impress other people,

06:20.125 --> 06:21.917
but not me. Or my mom.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.375
Protective!
Okay, I get it.

06:25.458 --> 06:28.375
I tell you what.
I'll make you a deal:

06:28.458 --> 06:30.083
How about I get you
into that show,

06:30.166 --> 06:31.959
no money,
no connections and...

06:32.041 --> 06:33.709
you cut me a little slack
with your mom.

06:33.792 --> 06:35.917
Like a tryout!
Sports term, right?

06:36.000 --> 06:38.417
What's in it for me
if you lose?

06:38.500 --> 06:40.709
Well, you get to tell
your mom how lame I am.

06:40.792 --> 06:43.583
And you have to post it
on the Internet.

06:43.667 --> 06:46.041
Stakes! I love it.

06:46.125 --> 06:49.291
The helicopter will be here Saturday
at 3:00 to pick you up.

06:49.375 --> 06:50.917
I mean, I'll get here early
and we'll take

06:51.000 --> 06:53.792
public transportation
like normal people.

06:53.875 --> 06:55.291
-This was fun. Let's do it again.
-Okay.

06:59.041 --> 07:00.333
-Okay.
-Okay.

07:00.417 --> 07:01.625
Buddy.

07:14.208 --> 07:15.583
-You ready?
-Yeah.

07:15.667 --> 07:17.667
But you're kind of
in the way of everything.

07:17.750 --> 07:19.375
That's kind of the point.

07:21.083 --> 07:22.208
Oh.

07:22.375 --> 07:23.792
Walk it off.

07:25.458 --> 07:26.875
Okay, you ready
to try one?

07:29.500 --> 07:30.959
Yeah, whoo!

07:33.750 --> 07:35.834
All right, then here
it comes.

07:42.417 --> 07:43.333
Really good.

07:43.375 --> 07:45.000
-Relax, that was a good one.
-That was nice.

07:45.083 --> 07:47.667
Yeah, but not
"Jimmy Wilson" nice.

07:47.750 --> 07:49.709
Yeah, well, don't tell
Jimmy Wilson.

07:49.792 --> 07:50.667
That guy is
a dingus.

07:50.750 --> 07:51.917
Hey, hey.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.625
That is Jimmy Wilson.

07:53.709 --> 07:54.917
That one?

07:56.834 --> 07:58.250
Hi, Jimmy. I'm Ryan.

07:58.333 --> 08:00.375
Why should Jimmy Wilson
know your name when...

08:00.458 --> 08:02.166
nobody else will?

08:03.417 --> 08:05.166
Okay, just because
we're competing

08:05.250 --> 08:07.125
doesn't mean
you get to be a jerk.

08:07.208 --> 08:09.834
Jimmy Wilson is
the king of this.

08:09.917 --> 08:12.083
That makes it
Jimmy Wilson territory.

08:12.166 --> 08:14.834
Well, does Jimmy Wilson
know how to use a pronoun?

08:14.917 --> 08:16.709
I don't know
how to use a pronoun.

08:16.792 --> 08:19.834
Honestly, you think
you can win with a trick

08:19.917 --> 08:21.417
Jimmy Wilson mastered?

08:21.500 --> 08:22.917
Can you do it
backwards?

08:26.208 --> 08:27.750
Okay, I gotta wreck
this guy.

08:27.834 --> 08:29.208
(Jimmy)
Forwards?

08:29.291 --> 08:31.583
Dude, you're just here
to relax.

08:32.875 --> 08:33.917
(Jimmy)
On one foot?

08:34.000 --> 08:36.250
Okay, I'm relaxed, Okay?
I'm very relaxed!

08:36.333 --> 08:38.417
(Jimmy)
Backwards and blindfolded?

08:38.500 --> 08:40.875
How did I even put
this thing on?

08:44.750 --> 08:46.875
(Skaters)
Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy!

08:46.959 --> 08:50.166
Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy!

08:50.250 --> 08:51.792
You're gonna beat
all that...

08:52.875 --> 08:55.375
on this hand-me-down
piece of trash?

08:55.458 --> 08:57.041
(Skaters)
Oh!

08:58.041 --> 09:01.500
Jimmy Wilson is gonna smoke you.

09:05.542 --> 09:07.333
Relax-time is over.

09:07.417 --> 09:10.208
(Davage) Walker hangs with that
little desert rat Spyder.

09:10.291 --> 09:12.125
Can I at least go after him?

09:12.208 --> 09:15.125
We can't just eliminate
every kid in Bay City.

09:15.208 --> 09:16.542
Why not?

09:16.625 --> 09:18.250
This planet will be
a wasteland soon.

09:19.875 --> 09:21.250
(Mastermind)
Grey!

09:21.333 --> 09:23.333
Sir. I'm very close
to finding the people

09:23.417 --> 09:26.291
behind Mech-X4
and bringing them to you in a box.

09:26.375 --> 09:28.375
(Davage)
We know one of the pilots...

09:31.417 --> 09:33.709
Their identities are
leverage.

09:33.792 --> 09:34.875
(Mastermind)
Grey.

09:34.959 --> 09:38.166
Sorry. Some child came into my office
wanting something.

09:38.250 --> 09:40.000
(Mastermind)
My patience has limits.

09:40.083 --> 09:41.667
I expect to see results.

09:41.750 --> 09:43.875
And you know
the punishment for failure.

09:46.959 --> 09:48.375
He's getting impatient.

09:48.417 --> 09:50.875
We can't just wait
for Walker to lead us

09:50.959 --> 09:53.417
to the pilots
or the robot any more.

09:53.500 --> 09:57.000
We need to do something
to force him into action.

09:57.083 --> 09:58.625
We need...

09:58.709 --> 10:01.834
to put people in danger.

10:02.834 --> 10:03.834
Finally.

10:12.959 --> 10:15.417
Whoa. You've been busy.

10:15.500 --> 10:17.208
And nice with
the gravity pucks.

10:17.291 --> 10:18.375
Like it?

10:18.458 --> 10:20.875
-Little area for you to train.
-Sweet.

10:20.959 --> 10:23.083
(Harris)
Also, I put in some video games

10:23.166 --> 10:24.917
-and Internet for Spyder.
-Cool.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.750
And that thing
Mark likes.

10:26.834 --> 10:28.166
Yeah, that's got to go.

10:29.500 --> 10:32.625
So, wait, you did all of this
in two days?

10:32.709 --> 10:33.792
Yep!

10:36.709 --> 10:40.667
And we can now 3-D print food.

10:48.959 --> 10:50.834
Would you like
a tuna sandwich

10:50.917 --> 10:53.375
built by science to be the best tasting
tuna sandwich

10:53.458 --> 10:54.834
you've ever had?

10:58.792 --> 11:01.291
Mm! Mm! This is
really good.

11:01.375 --> 11:02.542
-Right?
-Mm-hmm.

11:02.625 --> 11:04.166
Can you believe this machine
takes garbage

11:04.250 --> 11:05.709
and recycle it back into food?

11:05.792 --> 11:07.125
You're eating
an old shoe right now.

11:08.542 --> 11:09.750
This is awesome.

11:09.834 --> 11:11.250
What?

11:11.333 --> 11:12.834
Now you have
a place to relax!

11:12.917 --> 11:14.041
What do you want
to do first?

11:14.125 --> 11:16.208
Well,
I'm gonna use these.

11:16.291 --> 11:18.333
And I'm gonna crush
that Jimmy Wilson kid.

11:18.417 --> 11:20.500
Um, isn't that
cheating?

11:20.583 --> 11:21.625
Is it? Um...

11:21.709 --> 11:23.291
Yes.

11:23.375 --> 11:24.959
But is it really?

11:25.041 --> 11:27.000
-Yes, I'm sure.
-Are you sure it's cheating?

11:27.083 --> 11:29.375
Every time you ask me
if it's cheating, it's cheating.

11:30.417 --> 11:31.834
But are you positive...

11:31.917 --> 11:35.208
That you're using gravity pucks to be a
better skater to win a competition?

11:35.291 --> 11:37.041
I'm pretty sure
it's cheating.

11:37.125 --> 11:39.500
Whoo! Okay,
this will do.

11:40.583 --> 11:42.125
And I say
it's justice.

11:42.208 --> 11:43.750
That Jimmy Wilson kid
is a jerk.

11:43.834 --> 11:45.333
Ho! Hoo!

11:45.417 --> 11:47.625
You're turning this skate competition
into a battle.

11:47.709 --> 11:49.250
You're supposed to be
having fun.

11:49.333 --> 11:50.792
Oh, believe me,

11:50.875 --> 11:52.625
this will be fun.

11:54.792 --> 11:56.250
Oh!

11:57.542 --> 11:58.834
Good evening.

11:58.917 --> 12:01.208
Ticket line's over there.
General admission is over there.

12:01.291 --> 12:02.583
We've got neither.

12:02.667 --> 12:03.959
Then you are in the way.

12:04.041 --> 12:05.750
Let's see the magic.

12:05.834 --> 12:07.333
Hm. My friend...

12:07.417 --> 12:09.250
Sold out.

12:09.333 --> 12:10.166
You sure?

12:10.250 --> 12:13.250
'Cause you and I both know that you've
got a side ticket or two for your friends?

12:13.333 --> 12:14.875
Maybe the ladies?

12:14.959 --> 12:15.834
No.

12:15.917 --> 12:17.458
And that's
incredibly sexist.

12:17.542 --> 12:18.583
Right?

12:18.667 --> 12:19.959
I... I didn't mean it like...

12:20.041 --> 12:21.542
What? Oh.

12:21.625 --> 12:22.875
Oh, hey, guys.
Thank you.

12:22.959 --> 12:24.208
What about that?

12:24.291 --> 12:25.583
They work
with the crew.

12:25.667 --> 12:27.458
-They work with the...
-With the crew.

12:27.542 --> 12:29.792
You think just because
they're cute they don't have jobs?

12:29.875 --> 12:30.709
Ah.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.083
Dude, you're on fire.

12:32.166 --> 12:33.875
I mean, at least
if you tried to bribe me,

12:33.959 --> 12:34.917
I'd respect that.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.166
Okay. Copy that.

12:40.834 --> 12:42.208
Move.

12:43.917 --> 12:45.125
Yep. He's good.

12:45.208 --> 12:46.583
Okay.

12:49.375 --> 12:50.667
Plan B.

13:15.750 --> 13:16.959
Well, that's good.

13:18.208 --> 13:19.959
Really?
You showed up?

13:20.041 --> 13:22.375
Get your beater
of a board fixed in time?

13:22.458 --> 13:25.750
Yeah.
You could say that.

13:27.583 --> 13:28.917
(music plays inside)

13:30.125 --> 13:31.709
(Mark)
This plan is stupid.

13:31.792 --> 13:34.291
Listen, that's the crew entrance.
Okay?

13:34.375 --> 13:35.959
All we have to do
is hide out inside here

13:36.041 --> 13:37.667
until somebody opens that door.

13:37.750 --> 13:38.834
Now!

13:38.917 --> 13:40.834
Go, go, go!
Go, go, go, go!

13:40.917 --> 13:42.291
-Come on. Whoa!
-Whoa!

13:43.458 --> 13:44.792
(slushing)

13:51.166 --> 13:52.709
Great idea, man.

13:52.792 --> 13:55.458
We're not in
and you fried my phone.

13:55.542 --> 13:58.041
That's because
you've got the wrong phone.

13:58.125 --> 14:00.625
The HarpPhone4
is waterproof.

14:00.709 --> 14:02.750
(cellphone buzzing)
Oh, it still works.

14:02.834 --> 14:03.834
Hey, Grace.

14:03.917 --> 14:06.291
No, we're having
a great time. Right, Mark?

14:09.208 --> 14:11.500
-Oh.
-Oh.

14:11.583 --> 14:13.792
-Hello, Ryan.
-Principal Grey.

14:14.917 --> 14:16.834
What are you doing here?
You... You skate?

14:16.917 --> 14:18.834
I've been known
to shred a few things.

14:18.917 --> 14:20.375
-Oh.
-But no.

14:20.458 --> 14:22.667
-Oh.
-I was just passing by and saw

14:22.750 --> 14:24.458
that you were in the competition.
Good for you.

14:24.542 --> 14:26.458
-Yeah.
-It's great that you have a passion.

14:26.542 --> 14:27.959
Thank you.

14:33.375 --> 14:34.500
All right.

14:34.583 --> 14:35.834
Good luck.

14:46.333 --> 14:47.750
(phone buzzing)

14:49.750 --> 14:51.750
Ha! The monster alert
works!

14:52.834 --> 14:54.291
Oh, wait. No. That's bad.

14:57.667 --> 14:59.417
(cellphone ringing)

15:01.041 --> 15:02.709
Oh, hey, Harris.
What's up?

15:02.792 --> 15:04.875
A monster?
A monster!

15:07.000 --> 15:08.166
Perfect.

15:10.625 --> 15:11.709
Okay, we have to go.

15:11.792 --> 15:13.000
But you're next.

15:19.208 --> 15:20.625
(Ryan)
There now I'm last.

15:20.709 --> 15:22.375
That ought to buy us
some time. Let's go.

15:31.041 --> 15:32.250
Ready?

15:32.333 --> 15:35.083
Three, two, one!

15:38.375 --> 15:40.417
Yes. Run.

15:41.583 --> 15:44.583
The tracking nest
is working perfectly.

15:44.667 --> 15:47.625
There's nowhere you can go now
that I can't follow.

15:52.041 --> 15:53.250
(people screaming)

15:54.917 --> 15:55.917
(roaring)

15:59.667 --> 16:00.917
(roaring)

16:02.166 --> 16:03.458
(all screaming)

16:09.375 --> 16:10.500
(car alarm blares)

16:12.375 --> 16:13.417
It's alive?

16:13.500 --> 16:15.583
-Yeah, and it has wings.
-This thing has upgrades?

16:15.667 --> 16:17.667
That's cool and terrifying.

16:17.750 --> 16:19.458
We got to get him away
from those people.

16:19.542 --> 16:20.875
Let's move!

16:41.667 --> 16:43.041
Guys, we can't reach it!

16:49.917 --> 16:50.917
Whoa!

16:59.375 --> 17:00.625
Harris, shields up.

17:00.709 --> 17:02.417
Spyder?

17:09.000 --> 17:10.792
(cheering)

17:10.875 --> 17:12.458
That was a close one.

17:12.542 --> 17:14.917
-(people cheering)
-Thank you, thank you.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.750
I cannot believe
that Mark missed this.

17:17.834 --> 17:19.208
Maybe he got into
that show.

17:19.291 --> 17:20.709
He is Mark Walker.

17:21.709 --> 17:23.375
Okay, I've got a new plan.

17:23.458 --> 17:25.333
It involves three toddlers
dressed as an adult

17:25.417 --> 17:26.959
and a small chihuahua.
Are you allergic?

17:27.041 --> 17:28.333
Dude. Show's over.

17:28.417 --> 17:30.917
Turn on your HarpPhone
and start telling the world

17:31.000 --> 17:32.792
that you're lame.

17:32.875 --> 17:33.875
(groans)

17:33.959 --> 17:35.458
All right, all right.

17:35.542 --> 17:37.208
I am a man of my word.

17:37.291 --> 17:41.083
So, should I humiliate
myself selfie-style

17:41.166 --> 17:43.542
or do you wanna film me
telling the world what a loser I am?

17:43.625 --> 17:45.333
What was your angle in all this?

17:45.417 --> 17:47.417
Why was this
so important to you?

17:47.500 --> 17:49.458
Look, I know I'm a...

17:49.542 --> 17:50.959
What's the word you guys use?

17:51.041 --> 17:52.458
Nimwit? Dingus?

17:52.542 --> 17:55.041
Oh, no, no.
We agreed on lame.

17:55.125 --> 17:56.250
That's the one.

17:56.333 --> 17:59.875
Look, you and Ryan
are always gonna be

17:59.959 --> 18:01.917
the most important thing
in the world to your mom.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.875
I guess I just wanted
to show her that

18:03.959 --> 18:05.625
we could be buds.

18:06.792 --> 18:08.792
Okay, time to do this.

18:11.875 --> 18:13.041
I a lame man.

18:13.125 --> 18:14.625
-Okay.
-So lame...

18:14.709 --> 18:16.291
Deals can change.

18:16.375 --> 18:17.834
Maybe you don't need
to do this.

18:17.917 --> 18:20.583
Maybe I believe you.
But...

18:21.959 --> 18:23.208
Probation.

18:23.291 --> 18:25.667
-Probation.
-Yeah.

18:25.750 --> 18:28.125
It's edgy. I'll take it!

18:29.709 --> 18:31.291
But still...

18:31.375 --> 18:33.917
I'm really sorry I couldn't get you
into that show.

18:35.041 --> 18:37.709
Well... if it means
that much to you,

18:37.792 --> 18:39.375
you could throw your wallet around.

18:39.458 --> 18:41.250
Finally, thank you.
I'll tell you what.

18:42.709 --> 18:43.834
You do the honors.

18:43.917 --> 18:46.166
(techno music playing)

18:47.208 --> 18:48.542
Whoo!

18:55.959 --> 18:57.083
What?

18:59.834 --> 19:01.709
Hey, you said
you wanted us to bond.

19:03.583 --> 19:04.834
Actually it's not bad.

19:12.250 --> 19:16.291
(Crowd)
Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy!

19:16.375 --> 19:22.166
Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy!

19:22.834 --> 19:25.375
Okay, you know what?
One good run and that guy goes down.

19:26.792 --> 19:29.667
But just remember,
this is cheating.

19:29.750 --> 19:32.000
Is this really gonna
make you feel like a winner?

19:36.125 --> 19:37.834
Oh, yes!

19:42.291 --> 19:44.291
-Yes!
-Yes!

19:44.375 --> 19:47.291
Mech-X4! Mech-X4!

19:48.667 --> 19:50.834
You know what?
This isn't a battle.

19:50.917 --> 19:53.583
We've got plenty
of wins in Mech-X4.

19:53.667 --> 19:55.083
I'm supposed
to have fun.

19:55.166 --> 19:56.458
Hey, but watch out, okay?

19:56.542 --> 19:59.583
Because this trick is gonna be so
impossible, so amazing, so crazy,

19:59.667 --> 20:02.834
it's gonna blow your minds.

20:02.917 --> 20:04.041
Ready?

20:10.000 --> 20:11.125
-(crashes)
-(crowd groans)

20:12.792 --> 20:13.834
Medic!

20:13.917 --> 20:16.291
(Crowd)
Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy!

20:16.375 --> 20:17.834
Thank you!

20:17.917 --> 20:19.166
Thank you, thank you!

20:19.250 --> 20:21.917
And a shout out
to Ryan Walker!

20:22.000 --> 20:23.834
You did your best.

20:23.917 --> 20:25.375
Still proud of you.

20:25.458 --> 20:27.625
Yeah, but you should
have used the bounce belt.

20:27.709 --> 20:29.709
But you still ate it like a chump!

20:29.792 --> 20:31.291
(Crowd)
(laughing)

20:31.375 --> 20:33.750
-You know what? Forget about it.
-Yeah. Planning on it.

20:33.834 --> 20:36.291
And your little friends
are dorks.

20:39.875 --> 20:41.125
End him.

20:41.208 --> 20:43.709
He must be destroyed.

20:43.792 --> 20:46.792
Jimmy Wilson's got that...
that gift, you know?

20:46.875 --> 20:48.667
That special...

20:48.750 --> 20:51.208
-you know, something.
-Whoo-hoo!

20:52.291 --> 20:53.834
And I think...

20:56.750 --> 20:58.625
(Ryan)
I am flying. Whoo!

21:11.959 --> 21:13.041
(crowd cheering)

21:26.083 --> 21:27.792
The chemical trail
worked perfectly.

21:27.875 --> 21:29.750
I found Mech-X4.

21:29.834 --> 21:32.834
(Mastermind)
You found the robot? Where is it?

21:33.959 --> 21:36.417
I think it's time
we finally meet, don't you?

21:36.500 --> 21:37.667
(Mastermind)
Very well.

21:37.750 --> 21:40.000
Destroy the pilots.
Bring the robot to me.

21:40.083 --> 21:41.792
And then, yes, we can meet.

21:41.875 --> 21:45.458
It's done.
They just don't know it yet.

21:51.709 --> 21:53.041
(theme music playing)
