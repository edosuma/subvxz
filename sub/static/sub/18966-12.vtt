00:00.004 --> 00:01.966
Previously on
<i>The Client List...</i>

00:01.967 --> 00:04.343
Someone just broke into my
house, and they attacked Lacey.

00:04.344 --> 00:05.944
Do you think it was Carlyle?
It's possible.

00:05.979 --> 00:08.188
Carlyle has been after
the Rub clients for a while.

00:08.189 --> 00:10.156
I'd like to raise the offer ...
$200,000.

00:10.191 --> 00:12.125
Lacey just lost her baby
because of this son of a bitch.

00:12.159 --> 00:13.039
She what?
I-I didn't even know she ...

00:13.064 --> 00:13.994
Yeah, well, now you do.

00:13.995 --> 00:15.528
This is who
we're trying to find.

00:15.563 --> 00:17.497
Why are you still trying
to find him?

00:17.531 --> 00:19.633
Sean Foster,
the guy that attacked Lacey ...

00:19.667 --> 00:20.667
I'm looking at him
right now.

00:20.701 --> 00:21.968
Don't
do anything stupid.

00:22.003 --> 00:23.470
You're not going anywhere,
asshole.

00:23.504 --> 00:25.338
Aaah!
Get out of the car!

00:25.373 --> 00:27.461
When did you go from "I'm done
being Riley's errand boy"

00:27.495 --> 00:29.158
to putting both our jobs
on the line for her?

00:29.192 --> 00:30.960
You can't lie for me.
It's already done.

00:30.994 --> 00:32.959
Triangle relationship
does not work.

00:32.993 --> 00:33.648
You're dating someone new.

00:33.673 --> 00:35.203
Kyle and I are trying
to work on our marriage.

00:35.204 --> 00:36.370
I should be
going back to my motel?

00:36.404 --> 00:37.710
I guess so.
I want to come home.

00:37.744 --> 00:39.549
I want my wedding
to only be about love.

00:39.584 --> 00:41.590
Georgia and I ...
we don't have any secrets.

00:41.626 --> 00:43.395
This place is your life.

00:43.430 --> 00:45.364
It cost me
my first husband.

00:48.271 --> 00:50.838
* Whoa-oh, whoa-oh *

00:50.872 --> 00:56.712
* whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh,
oh-oh, ohh *

00:58.483 --> 01:01.288
* whoa-oh, whoa-oh *

01:01.322 --> 01:06.727
* whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh,
oh-oh, ohh *

01:08.130 --> 01:11.598
So, you put out any fires
lately?

01:11.632 --> 01:14.802
A small one ... Spindle Hill.
No biggie.

01:14.836 --> 01:16.571
You can brag, you know.

01:16.605 --> 01:18.408
You're a real, live hero.

01:18.442 --> 01:21.111
One that just got knifed
in the back by his wife.

01:21.145 --> 01:23.314
She cheated.

01:23.349 --> 01:26.118
Ohh. Ouch.

01:28.655 --> 01:31.659
She swears it'll never happen
again, but I can't get over it.

01:31.693 --> 01:32.994
I know
it's not fair that ...

01:33.028 --> 01:34.295
Yeah,
because you come here.

01:34.329 --> 01:36.130
Still hard to forgive.

01:36.165 --> 01:39.401
Well...Don't wait for the anger
to be gone.

01:39.435 --> 01:41.970
Forgiveness ...
that is a choice.

01:42.004 --> 01:44.273
You know,
you decide in your mind first,

01:44.307 --> 01:46.608
and then your heart
catches right on that.

01:46.643 --> 01:49.579
You're right.

01:49.613 --> 01:50.914
I should probably ...

01:50.949 --> 01:52.983
start with a clean slate.

01:53.018 --> 01:54.452
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:54.486 --> 01:56.789
I always hate to lose
one of my favorite clients,

01:56.823 --> 01:59.792
but I will be real happy to see
your marriage work out.

01:59.826 --> 02:03.129
What do you say we make our last
time one for the record books?

02:03.164 --> 02:04.431
Okay, then.

02:08.071 --> 02:10.205
Uh...change of plans.

02:10.240 --> 02:12.641
Blue light just flashed.

02:12.675 --> 02:15.777
No problem.
I know the rules.

02:15.812 --> 02:18.347
Stick to legal body parts.

02:18.381 --> 02:21.317
It's not nearly as fun, but I'll
be back in a few minutes.

02:23.721 --> 02:26.456
Hey.

02:26.490 --> 02:29.527
Evan. Hey.
What a surprise.

02:29.561 --> 02:31.462
Oh, you two know
each other?

02:31.497 --> 02:33.297
Yeah, he's my husband's brother.
I'm her brother-in-law.

02:33.332 --> 02:35.834
Excuse me.

02:35.868 --> 02:38.637
Listen, sorry about that whole
scene at the station the other night.

02:38.671 --> 02:39.972
No, let's just not
get into it.

02:40.006 --> 02:41.841
As long as things aren't weird
between us.

02:41.875 --> 02:43.209
No, we're good.

02:43.243 --> 02:46.046
Doesn't feel that way,
but...okay.

02:46.080 --> 02:48.048
You know, you're
out of your patrol area ...

02:48.082 --> 02:50.350
I mean, like, way out ...
so  what are you ...

02:50.384 --> 02:52.152
what are you doing here
in sugar land?

02:52.186 --> 02:54.021
Yeah, it's not
official police business.

02:54.055 --> 02:56.223
I actually threw out my neck.
Ohh.

02:56.258 --> 02:58.259
I can barely move it, so I was
wondering if you could fit me in.

02:58.294 --> 03:00.362
I mean, not you, of course.

03:00.396 --> 03:02.865
That would just be...
Weird.

03:02.899 --> 03:07.036
Is it strange giving a massage
to a guy you slept with?

03:07.071 --> 03:08.205
No.

03:08.239 --> 03:10.507
Not at all.

03:10.542 --> 03:12.943
I mean, it usually happens
before the big event,

03:12.977 --> 03:15.379
but...after works, too.

03:15.414 --> 03:18.350
So, whatever happened
between us, huh?

03:18.384 --> 03:21.953
I mean, we went on, what,
like three dates and...

03:21.988 --> 03:23.622
Bad timing?

03:23.656 --> 03:25.524
Yeah,
it doesn't really matter.

03:25.558 --> 03:27.760
I'm not really
a one-man type of woman,

03:27.794 --> 03:30.529
but you seem like
a one-woman type of man.

03:30.564 --> 03:33.567
Sounds like a country song.

03:33.601 --> 03:34.735
A crappy one.

03:34.769 --> 03:36.970
All right.
Oh, you are tight.

03:37.005 --> 03:39.273
Is something going on
at work?

03:39.307 --> 03:41.408
Which, by the way, I hear
you're a full-fledged cop now.

03:41.443 --> 03:43.077
Oh, yeah. That's right.

03:43.111 --> 03:44.779
Don't let me catch you
on the wrong side of the law.

03:44.814 --> 03:48.583
How'd you hurt yourself ...
tackling a suspect?

03:48.618 --> 03:50.585
No.

03:50.620 --> 03:52.454
There's this woman
I'm seeing.

03:52.488 --> 03:53.788
She's freezing me out.

03:53.823 --> 03:55.958
I guess the tension went
to my neck.

03:55.992 --> 03:58.728
Oh, that's what I hear
from all my clients.

03:58.762 --> 04:00.796
Women are the source
of all tension.

04:00.831 --> 04:02.064
Yeah.
I met her at the Academy.

04:02.099 --> 04:03.466
No! Sorry.

04:03.500 --> 04:06.970
You don't date
the people you work with.

04:07.004 --> 04:09.272
I mean, it's just a disaster
waiting to happen.

04:09.307 --> 04:10.640
Where else
do you meet people?

04:10.675 --> 04:12.576
I don't know.
Just not on the clock.

04:12.610 --> 04:14.278
What about you?
You seeing someone?

04:14.312 --> 04:15.846
Maybe.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.781
Well,
where'd you meet him?

04:17.815 --> 04:19.817
You know, since when did
this session become about me?

04:19.851 --> 04:22.420
Just lay down.
Hush up.

04:22.454 --> 04:23.487
Relax.

Oh, my God. Come on.

04:31.064 --> 04:32.698
Right? Was I right?

04:32.733 --> 04:35.802
Yeah, I mean, it's not bad
for a 14-rated food truck.

04:35.836 --> 04:36.970
14-rated?

04:37.004 --> 04:38.304
Come on.
Those lists are rigged.

04:38.338 --> 04:39.839
I'm telling you.
This place is the bomb.

04:39.873 --> 04:41.173
Look at this.

04:41.208 --> 04:42.541
You got pork and beef
in the same sandwich.

04:42.575 --> 04:45.044
Mm-hmm.
Come on. That's good. Mmm.

04:45.078 --> 04:47.313
Are you gonna drink that?

04:47.347 --> 04:49.681
Y...
mmm.

04:49.716 --> 04:51.650
I've been working out so hard.
Have you?

04:51.684 --> 04:53.218
You know,
I forgot to tell you ...

04:53.253 --> 04:55.287
I had a late-night
load of lumber to drop off.

04:55.322 --> 04:56.655
That sounds so disgusting.

04:56.689 --> 04:58.190
No, no, no ...
lumber, not logs.

04:58.224 --> 05:00.358
Guess who
the delivery was for.

05:00.393 --> 05:01.526
Who's that?

05:01.560 --> 05:03.528
Vandermeyer Construction
Company.

05:03.562 --> 05:06.231
What? That isn't weird?

05:06.265 --> 05:08.000
Come on. That's crazy.
It's not that crazy.

05:08.034 --> 05:09.401
It's a huge construction
company.

05:09.436 --> 05:11.137
By the way,
what's going on with the case?

05:11.171 --> 05:12.739
You still have to testify
against that dude?

05:12.773 --> 05:15.074
Yeah. Yeah.
I'm just waiting for a date.

05:15.109 --> 05:16.476
How's Riley handling
the whole thing?

05:16.510 --> 05:18.311
I asked her if I could move back
in the house.

05:18.345 --> 05:20.246
You want my advice?
No.

05:20.280 --> 05:22.515
You got to stop
pushing her.

05:22.549 --> 05:23.983
Did you hear me say "no"?

05:24.017 --> 05:26.752
You need to be the wind
in the willow, my friend.

05:26.786 --> 05:28.020
The book ...
from elementary school?

05:28.054 --> 05:29.555
No, not the book.
Forget about the book.

05:29.589 --> 05:30.989
What are you talking about?
See this?

05:31.023 --> 05:33.391
You got to be the willow
in the wind, okay?

05:33.426 --> 05:35.093
Okay.

05:35.127 --> 05:37.829
Wind goes left,
you go left, right?

05:37.864 --> 05:39.164
Wind goes right...

05:39.198 --> 05:41.500
I go right.
Hey, now you're getting it.

05:41.534 --> 05:44.203
The trick is to bend ...
all right? ... And not break.

05:44.237 --> 05:45.704
This is serious.
Okay.

05:45.739 --> 05:48.541
You ... you have to
just let Riley

05:48.575 --> 05:51.210
ask the willow to come back.

05:51.244 --> 05:52.611
So, the bottom line here ...
don't be the oak.

05:52.645 --> 05:54.246
Don't be the oak.

05:54.280 --> 05:56.214
Be the willow.

05:56.249 --> 05:58.717
Be the willow.
Are you gonna eat that?

05:58.751 --> 06:00.753
Got it.

06:00.787 --> 06:03.388
Don't...like you.
So, there we go.

06:03.423 --> 06:04.956
Oh, hey.

06:04.991 --> 06:07.425
I need to give a final
head count to the caterer,

06:07.460 --> 06:09.794
so you bringing a plus-one
to Georgia's wedding?

06:09.829 --> 06:10.962
Uh, no, it's just me.

06:10.997 --> 06:12.564
I didn't get
a plus-one, anyway.

06:12.598 --> 06:14.199
Everyone got a plus-one,

06:14.234 --> 06:16.635
and I know that because I made
all the invitations.

06:16.670 --> 06:17.636
Oh.

06:17.671 --> 06:19.638
Well,
the answer's still no.

06:19.673 --> 06:21.807
Selena, you could ask
that cute banker guy

06:21.842 --> 06:23.142
that was hitting on you
at the gym.

06:23.177 --> 06:24.457
Didn't you have a drink
with him?

06:24.478 --> 06:25.812
He talked about his shih tzu
all night.

06:25.846 --> 06:28.081
Aww. Well, ask him anyway.

06:28.115 --> 06:30.416
Going to a wedding alone
is so depressing.

06:30.451 --> 06:32.411
You know, I don't know
why everyone feels so sorry

06:32.420 --> 06:33.620
for the girl
without a date.

06:33.654 --> 06:35.989
It's not so bad.

06:36.023 --> 06:38.125
I mean, you get to come and go
as you please,

06:38.159 --> 06:40.427
and those dance floors ...
they're a happy hunting ground.

06:40.461 --> 06:42.429
I wouldn't know.
I'm taking my husband.

06:42.463 --> 06:44.244
I keep forgetting
that you're married.

06:44.269 --> 06:44.865
Right?

06:44.866 --> 06:46.500
Must be hard to have
a husband

06:46.534 --> 06:48.235
and do this job
at the same time.

06:48.269 --> 06:49.670
How does that work?

06:49.704 --> 06:51.605
Oh, Harold's calling.

06:51.640 --> 06:54.275
Yay. Hi.
Wait, what?

06:54.309 --> 06:56.911
Okay. Well, don't worry about
a thing. I'm on my way.

06:56.945 --> 06:58.145
Sorry.

06:58.179 --> 07:00.280
Maid of honor to the rescue.

07:01.716 --> 07:03.450
Don't touch that.

07:07.021 --> 07:08.522
Hey.
Ohh.

07:08.556 --> 07:11.024
I got here as soon as I could.
How bad is it? Oh, God.

07:11.059 --> 07:12.660
She is reorganizing
the liquor.

07:12.694 --> 07:13.927
Yeah,
for the second time.

07:13.962 --> 07:15.295
That's why I called you.

07:15.330 --> 07:16.663
Good luck.
Okay.

07:16.698 --> 07:18.465
And thanks.
You got it.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.868
Hey, there, lady.
What is...going on?

07:20.902 --> 07:22.270
The cake.
Yeah ...

07:22.304 --> 07:24.672
looks perfect
for a 6-year-old.

07:24.707 --> 07:26.941
My wedding is ruined.
Georgia, that is not true.

07:26.975 --> 07:28.476
Now, it says,
"Happy Birthday, Lilly Marie."

07:28.510 --> 07:30.345
That means that Lilly Marie
has to have your cake,

07:30.379 --> 07:31.680
and so I'm gonna go
get it back.

07:31.714 --> 07:33.548
It's a bad omen, Riley.

07:33.582 --> 07:34.849
Georgia, there is nothing
to worry about.

07:34.883 --> 07:36.818
Nothing to worry about?

07:36.852 --> 07:40.655
I have a list a week long
and only two days to do it.

07:40.690 --> 07:42.922
Like the flowers ... you
have to remember to pluck

07:42.947 --> 07:44.192
the petals off the rose

07:44.193 --> 07:46.194
but not a moment ...
Moment too soon,

07:46.229 --> 07:47.509
because they will wilt and
shrivel up, and I got that.

07:47.534 --> 07:48.530
Oh, I almost forgot.

07:48.531 --> 07:50.366
Harold's sourpuss cousins
from Atlanta ...

07:50.400 --> 07:52.034
they're not coming,

07:52.069 --> 07:53.970
so that's two prime rib
and one fish dinner off ...

07:54.004 --> 07:55.871
Off the head count.
Got that, too.

07:55.906 --> 07:58.073
Can you help me with
the wedding-favor situation?

07:58.108 --> 08:00.376
They close at 5:00.
There's no way I can get there.

08:00.410 --> 08:02.478
Georgia, I got it.
It's gonna be taken care of.

08:02.513 --> 08:04.046
I don't mean
to be such a fuss,

08:04.081 --> 08:06.148
but this wedding has
just got to be perfect.

08:06.183 --> 08:08.017
And it will be.

08:08.051 --> 08:11.886
This is my chance, you know,
at a fresh start.

08:11.921 --> 08:15.557
I'm finally
getting everything right.

08:18.561 --> 08:20.690
Oh, let me move that seating chart.
Oh, thank you.

08:21.063 --> 08:22.597
It is a wonder
that modern man

08:22.631 --> 08:24.399
ever learned how to sit
without one.

08:24.434 --> 08:26.234
Hey, did you actually learn
calligraphy?

08:26.268 --> 08:28.003
No.
The computer learned it for me,

08:28.037 --> 08:30.605
but it took me two hours to get
the damn program to work.

08:30.639 --> 08:32.539
Well, please tell Georgia
thank you

08:32.575 --> 08:34.708
for giving you the night off
from maid-of-honoring.

08:34.743 --> 08:36.410
Yeah, it's nice.
Karina's got the kids.

08:36.445 --> 08:38.046
Mama's not here.
It's sort of quiet.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.615
How is Linette doing?
Uh, happier, I think.

08:40.649 --> 08:42.549
She's got a thing
for one of the orderlies,

08:42.583 --> 08:44.752
so that's a good sign,
and Kyle seems to be helping.

08:44.786 --> 08:46.754
How is it having him
back in the fold?

08:46.789 --> 08:48.056
Good. Weird.

08:48.090 --> 08:50.225
Sometimes it feels like
Christmas.

08:50.259 --> 08:51.927
That's great, right?

08:51.961 --> 08:53.228
Yeah. Um...

08:53.263 --> 08:55.598
He wants to move back in.

08:55.632 --> 08:57.266
Wow. That's a big step.

08:57.300 --> 08:59.636
Um, has he even
slept over yet?

08:59.670 --> 09:03.040
Just once, on the couch,
you know,

09:03.074 --> 09:04.941
but my job
complicates things.

09:04.975 --> 09:06.910
Yeah, 'cause you can't tell him,
obviously.

09:06.944 --> 09:08.779
Yeah, and running right
back into our marriage

09:08.813 --> 09:10.480
and then having to lie to him
every day ...

09:10.515 --> 09:11.881
I don't know
that I can do that.

09:11.916 --> 09:14.083
Well, the big guy said,
"thou shalt not lie."

09:14.118 --> 09:16.319
He never said,
"thou shalt not keep secrets."

09:16.353 --> 09:18.220
I appreciate you wanting
to split hairs for me,

09:18.255 --> 09:20.122
but I don't know.

09:20.157 --> 09:22.825
I just feel like I'm not giving us
a fresh start by hiding something.

09:22.860 --> 09:24.494
Well, you're just doing what
you have to do for your kids.

09:24.528 --> 09:26.362
Can we just talk about you
instead?

09:26.364 --> 09:27.664
Yes, but no baby talk.

09:27.698 --> 09:29.232
Dale thinks I'm depressed,

09:29.267 --> 09:30.934
and I'm not allowed to use
the "B" word.

09:30.969 --> 09:32.469
I'm under strict orders
to have fun!

09:32.504 --> 09:35.139
Hey, hey!
Hey! Hey!

09:35.173 --> 09:36.117
What's up?
You know what time it is?

09:36.142 --> 09:37.141
What time is it?

09:37.142 --> 09:38.576
It is 10 minutes
past party time.

09:38.610 --> 09:40.478
We have some catching up
to do.

09:40.512 --> 09:42.746
See what I mean? I'm married to
a Dallas Cowboy cheerleader.

09:42.781 --> 09:45.282
All right. We got lemons.
We got limes.

09:45.316 --> 09:49.186
We got triple sec
and white wine, oh, and rioja!

09:49.220 --> 09:51.488
Sparkling water for me.
Good call.

09:51.522 --> 09:52.634
Where is that pitcher
that Katie painted?

09:52.659 --> 09:53.890
Oh, same old place.

09:53.891 --> 09:55.859
You know what goes really well
with sangria?

09:55.893 --> 09:57.427
What?
A little...

09:57.462 --> 09:59.630
...Salsa!

10:01.065 --> 10:02.299
Yeah! Whoo!

10:02.333 --> 10:04.034
Oh. Oh, look ...
she's reeling me in.

10:04.068 --> 10:05.936
Oh, look at this.
Oh ho ho ho ho ho!

10:05.970 --> 10:08.205
Here we go!
We are having some fun!

10:08.239 --> 10:09.540
Bam, bam.
Come on!

10:09.574 --> 10:11.041
This is for Linette's rehab?

10:11.075 --> 10:13.710
Riley, $7,500?

10:13.745 --> 10:15.479
How are you gonna pay
for all this?

10:15.513 --> 10:18.114
Oh, you know that guy in the
circus who spins all the plates?

10:18.149 --> 10:19.516
- Oh, can we please eat?
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

10:19.550 --> 10:20.717
You guys,
put that bread on the table,

10:20.751 --> 10:22.552
and I hope
you guys are hungry,

10:22.587 --> 10:24.821
because I went a little bit
Martha Stewart on this chicken.

10:24.855 --> 10:27.123
Sounds good.
Oh, awesome. I'm so hungry.

10:27.157 --> 10:28.658
I don't think there's ever
been a time

10:28.692 --> 10:30.292
when I haven't been hungry.
Yes, I said that.

10:30.327 --> 10:31.694
Too much.
What's wrong?

10:31.728 --> 10:33.896
This looks so good.

10:38.435 --> 10:39.902
Hey,
I've been calling you.

10:39.937 --> 10:41.637
And texting and e-mailing.
I know.

10:41.672 --> 10:42.672
Shelby.

10:42.706 --> 10:44.040
Parks! Trimble!

10:46.577 --> 10:48.697
Heard you did good under
pressure, Parks, with Foster.

10:48.712 --> 10:50.547
Thank you, sir.

10:50.581 --> 10:53.316
So, you two rookies ready
for a little undercover work?

10:53.350 --> 10:55.251
By all means.
Born ready.

10:55.286 --> 10:57.554
'Cause you two are especially
qualified for this operation.

10:57.588 --> 10:59.923
Now, you're not to utter a word
about this

10:59.958 --> 11:01.758
to anybody outside these walls.
You understand?

11:01.793 --> 11:03.326
This part of your life
is top-secret.

11:03.361 --> 11:05.429
Of course, sir.

11:05.463 --> 11:07.764
What's the assignment,
lieutenant ...

11:07.799 --> 11:09.733
gangs, narcotics,
auto theft?

11:09.768 --> 11:12.169
Prostitution ...
massage parlor.

11:12.203 --> 11:14.471
You two pretty boys
are bait.

11:18.042 --> 11:19.910
All right, I know we got
a wedding in a few days.

11:19.944 --> 11:21.445
That's generally where
all the toasts happen.

11:21.479 --> 11:23.280
But I wanted to get started
a little early.

11:23.314 --> 11:25.248
Nice. I like that.
Toasts are fun.

11:25.283 --> 11:28.084
I forbid you from using that
word for the rest of the night ...

11:28.119 --> 11:29.419
not one more time.

11:29.453 --> 11:31.254
I've never known
a classier bunch.

11:31.288 --> 11:32.455
Most of us.

11:32.489 --> 11:34.457
Hey.

11:34.491 --> 11:36.392
Certainly don't know
a more forgiving one.

11:36.426 --> 11:39.928
Without getting into it, I know
that I have hurt all of you,

11:39.963 --> 11:43.565
which is only more
of a testament to your character

11:43.599 --> 11:46.868
that you've welcomed me back
into your hearts

11:46.903 --> 11:49.037
and hopefully back into
this home.

11:49.071 --> 11:51.639
Whoa, dude.
Willow. Come on.

11:51.674 --> 11:56.211
Anyway, so, thank you, guys,
for being awesome.

11:56.245 --> 11:58.146
Cheers. Cheers.
Cheers.

11:58.180 --> 11:59.480
To being awesome.

11:59.515 --> 12:01.049
Cheers.
We are that.

12:01.083 --> 12:02.383
All right!

12:02.418 --> 12:04.152
You gonna eat that?
Do you want it?

12:04.186 --> 12:05.387
No, no, no.
I just want to watch you eat it.

12:05.421 --> 12:06.421
That was nice.

12:06.456 --> 12:10.392
Ohh.

12:10.426 --> 12:13.094
Oh,
I forgot to tell you ...

12:13.129 --> 12:15.163
I have an interview at Beaumont
Building Supply tomorrow.

12:15.198 --> 12:16.398
Oh, that's great!
Yeah.

12:16.432 --> 12:18.300
I don't know.
It might be a long shot,

12:18.335 --> 12:19.602
but we'll see.

12:21.938 --> 12:23.299
Somehow, I'm gonna figure out
a way

12:23.306 --> 12:24.773
to take some of this pressure
off of you.

12:24.808 --> 12:27.109
I know you will.

12:27.143 --> 12:28.577
It was
a lot of fun tonight ...

12:28.611 --> 12:31.480
the four of us having dinner
here again together.

12:31.514 --> 12:33.615
Yes, it really was.

12:35.051 --> 12:36.652
It's getting late.

12:36.686 --> 12:38.287
I should go.

12:38.321 --> 12:40.322
Oh, okay.

12:42.792 --> 12:45.194
Good night.

12:45.228 --> 12:47.663
Good night.

12:47.697 --> 12:51.801
Hey, uh, what was
the whole Dale willow thing?

12:51.835 --> 12:53.302
I don't know.

12:53.336 --> 12:55.070
That's just Dale
being Dale.

13:04.232 --> 13:05.366
Uh-huh. For tomorrow?

13:05.400 --> 13:06.533
Yeah, a wedding cake.

13:06.568 --> 13:08.869
Look, we'll pay a rush fee.

13:08.904 --> 13:10.804
Right. Right. Yeah.

13:10.838 --> 13:12.906
Thanks for checking.
Shoot!

13:12.940 --> 13:14.674
Every damn bakery in Amarillo
said no.

13:14.708 --> 13:16.709
We're gonna have to buy
a pound cake from Shop 'n Save.

13:16.744 --> 13:18.511
Well, we're not giving up.
Oh, wait!

13:18.545 --> 13:22.148
Wait, here's one ...
Beyond This World Bakery, in Port Arthur.

13:22.182 --> 13:23.916
What ever happened to getting
Georgia's cake back?

13:23.951 --> 13:26.018
The little girls ate it.
Now give me your phone.

13:26.052 --> 13:27.587
Come on.
Georgia's counting on us.

13:27.621 --> 13:28.855
Here. Okay.

13:30.425 --> 13:31.825
Oh, yes, hi.

13:31.859 --> 13:33.660
Um, the thing is,

13:33.694 --> 13:36.363
I'm having an emergency
with my wedding cake.

13:36.397 --> 13:39.566
I-I'm supposed to be
getting married tomorrow.

13:40.968 --> 13:45.705
At least I think I am.

13:45.739 --> 13:48.107
Oh, please. Thank you.

13:48.142 --> 13:49.843
They have one. It's premade.

13:49.877 --> 13:51.078
Take it.
Okay.

13:51.112 --> 13:53.180
Oh, thank you!
Thank you so much!

13:53.214 --> 13:54.615
I'll come and pick it up.

13:54.649 --> 13:56.183
Oh, wow.

13:56.217 --> 13:57.584
I thought I was the expert at faking it.
Right?

13:57.619 --> 13:59.053
Yeah!

13:59.087 --> 14:00.621
I'm going to lunch.
You ladies need anything?

14:00.656 --> 14:02.190
Oh, actually,
could you help Selena

14:02.224 --> 14:03.357
get a date to the wedding?

14:03.392 --> 14:04.358
Don't start.
Ow!

14:04.393 --> 14:05.593
I love weddings. I'll go.

14:06.495 --> 14:08.730
What? Romance, free booze,
single chicks ...

14:08.764 --> 14:10.765
it's like spearfishing
in the tide pools.

14:10.799 --> 14:12.634
See? I told you ...
happy hunting grounds.

14:12.668 --> 14:14.836
Okay. So, let him take you.
He can help you hunt.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.239
You're just afraid
you won't be able to resist me.

14:18.274 --> 14:19.474
You want to try me?

14:19.508 --> 14:20.909
Saturday?
4:00.

14:20.943 --> 14:22.677
I'll pick you up.
Fine.

14:25.982 --> 14:29.251
Parks. So, tomorrow,
just so you know,

14:29.285 --> 14:31.220
I'm gonna be the guy
who nails those hookers.

14:31.254 --> 14:32.588
What you do
on your own time

14:32.622 --> 14:34.142
is really none of my business,
Trimble.

14:34.157 --> 14:35.824
I'm talking about the sting,
moron.

14:35.858 --> 14:38.460
Don't feel bad that I'll be
the one who makes the takedown.

14:38.494 --> 14:41.063
Everything you say
sounds dirty.

14:41.098 --> 14:43.599
Remember? I'm the guy who won
the marksmanship award.

14:43.633 --> 14:46.101
Which would be important
if we were shooting people.

14:46.135 --> 14:48.937
But if we were shooting people,
I would win.

14:48.972 --> 14:51.273
Your parents must be
so proud.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.710
Why?
Have you spoken to them?

15:03.888 --> 15:05.622
Don't just stand there.

15:05.657 --> 15:07.591
Say something, Lacey Jean.

15:07.626 --> 15:09.594
Oh, and interrupt
the Buddha?

15:09.628 --> 15:11.263
Are you kidding me?
Come here.

15:11.297 --> 15:12.631
Hey.
Ohh.

15:12.665 --> 15:15.267
I missed you.
You are looking so much better.

15:15.302 --> 15:16.869
Oh, thank you.

15:16.903 --> 15:18.303
I made it through to the other
side of my rough patch.

15:18.338 --> 15:19.538
I'm real proud of you.

15:19.572 --> 15:21.841
And I'm real proud of this.

15:21.875 --> 15:23.142
30 days.

15:23.177 --> 15:26.212
Oh, my God.
Congratulations.

15:26.246 --> 15:28.647
That's great. I know
it couldn't have been easy.

15:28.682 --> 15:30.816
I remember seeing my mama
go through this back in the day,

15:30.851 --> 15:34.286
and she wasn't able to beat it,
but I know that you will.

15:34.321 --> 15:36.589
- Oh, sweetheart.
- Thanks.

15:38.825 --> 15:40.159
Shelby won't talk to me.

15:40.193 --> 15:42.194
She won't even let me
get a full sentence out.

15:42.228 --> 15:43.796
Well, there's your first
mistake ... full sentences.

15:43.830 --> 15:45.030
You're not a full-sentence guy,
dude.

15:45.065 --> 15:46.298
You're a sound-bite man.

15:46.333 --> 15:48.234
You got to relax.
Dude, I'm serious.

15:48.268 --> 15:50.470
If she would just hear me out,
I could change her mind.

15:50.504 --> 15:52.372
I know it.
Women are tricky creatures, man.

15:52.406 --> 15:53.640
Sometimes it takes
a bold maneuver.

15:53.674 --> 15:54.874
Are you gonna drink that?

15:54.909 --> 15:56.977
Bold maneuver?
This ought to be good.

15:57.011 --> 15:58.345
Yeah. Sometimes you got
to pull out all the stops.

15:58.379 --> 15:59.813
I mean,
this shit sounds like

15:59.847 --> 16:01.481
you got to write "I'm sorry"
with a skywriter,

16:01.515 --> 16:02.883
or you can get
a graffiti artist.

16:02.917 --> 16:04.397
I know this guy.
He's not that nice ...

16:04.419 --> 16:06.720
Okay, what happened
to your do-nothing approach?

16:06.755 --> 16:08.355
Okay. You want to do it
on the cheap?

16:08.390 --> 16:10.091
You can do that, too.
You got to buy her a puppy.

16:10.125 --> 16:12.493
You got to write a sonnet
and attach it to the collar.

16:12.528 --> 16:14.762
I am so screwed.
You know what?

16:14.797 --> 16:17.698
I'm doing a bold maneuver
of my own for Lacey ...

16:17.733 --> 16:19.767
helping her
get her groove back.

16:19.801 --> 16:22.103
What, are you gonna write
"I love you" in chips and guacamole?

16:22.137 --> 16:25.006
You see me
through such a narrow lens.

16:25.040 --> 16:28.243
No. What I'm about to do
is so unbelievably romantic.

16:28.277 --> 16:30.912
If there's one thing that
this bear knows how to do,

16:30.946 --> 16:32.747
it's sweep his wife
off her feet.

16:32.782 --> 16:33.915
* Oh, oh, oh *

16:33.950 --> 16:35.550
* Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh *

16:35.585 --> 16:37.552
Just stay relaxed.
Balance.

16:37.587 --> 16:39.755
Balance is the key, right?

16:39.789 --> 16:41.557
And watch that ball.

16:41.591 --> 16:42.624
Ohh!
Watch that ball.

16:42.659 --> 16:44.460
That was a nice hit, honey.

16:44.494 --> 16:45.728
Okay? Turn on it.
It's all about the hips.

16:45.762 --> 16:47.696
You're squashing the bug.

16:47.731 --> 16:48.946
Oh, my God. There's a bug?
Where's the bug?

16:48.947 --> 16:49.622
No, no, no, no, no.

16:49.633 --> 16:51.768
I'm ... I'm pretending to squash
the bug, right?

16:51.802 --> 16:53.770
And you just turn in on it.
Turn on.

16:53.804 --> 16:55.405
Turn on it!
Hey, smile up there!

16:55.439 --> 16:57.807
You're having fun!
Smile up there!

16:57.841 --> 16:59.542
Hey, batter, batter, batter!
Now swing!

16:59.576 --> 17:01.144
Aah!
Hey, you got to warn me!

17:01.178 --> 17:03.713
I'm telling you!
That's what I just said!

17:03.748 --> 17:04.907
Okay, you got to concentrate.

17:04.928 --> 17:06.616
I was letting you know.
Come on. Here we go.

17:06.617 --> 17:09.086
Now!
I mean, is it just gonna keep doing this?

17:09.119 --> 17:10.588
Well, it's called
the pitching machine.

17:10.622 --> 17:11.655
Yes, I hope so.
Okay, right.

17:11.690 --> 17:13.057
But let's be honest.

17:13.090 --> 17:14.959
I mean, is this to cheer up
you or me?

17:14.992 --> 17:16.160
A little bit of both.

17:16.194 --> 17:17.228
Concentrate.
Come on. You can do this.

17:17.262 --> 17:19.263
Ohh!
Aah! Oh, my God!

17:19.298 --> 17:20.832
Did you see that?!

17:20.866 --> 17:22.599
Did you see that?!
Yes.

17:22.635 --> 17:24.002
I just hit it so far!

17:24.036 --> 17:26.304
I saw that.
That was awesome.

17:26.339 --> 17:27.439
You did great.

17:27.473 --> 17:29.307
You're back!
I'm back.

17:29.342 --> 17:30.943
Okay, get in that box.

17:30.977 --> 17:32.811
Here we go now.
Yes! Yeah!

17:32.846 --> 17:34.680
* Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh *

17:34.714 --> 17:35.848
You came back.

17:35.882 --> 17:38.316
What happened
to a clean slate?

17:38.351 --> 17:40.852
Right after I saw you...

17:40.886 --> 17:43.187
I was all set to tell her
that I forgave her,

17:43.222 --> 17:45.823
I'm ready to move on,
and she's gone ...

17:45.857 --> 17:48.259
cleaned out her closet.

17:48.293 --> 17:49.526
Oh, Adam.

17:49.560 --> 17:51.428
I save people's lives
for a living.

17:51.462 --> 17:52.696
I can't save a marriage?

17:52.730 --> 17:55.098
When I came here today,

17:55.132 --> 17:57.033
I thought this would make me
feel better, but...

17:57.067 --> 17:59.869
Hey, it's okay.
You don't have to.

17:59.903 --> 18:02.038
Guess I was a day late
and a dollar short.

18:14.017 --> 18:16.152
Hey, can you get my room ready
for 4:00?

18:16.186 --> 18:17.320
Thanks.

18:17.354 --> 18:19.088
Hey, babe.

18:20.524 --> 18:22.258
Kyle.

18:28.838 --> 18:31.140
So, the interview went
really well, and I-I saw these.

18:31.174 --> 18:32.841
I wanted to tell you
about it.

18:32.876 --> 18:35.678
Well, that's great.
They asked me if I could start Monday.

18:35.712 --> 18:37.022
You are perfect for that job.

18:37.023 --> 18:38.471
Yeah. I mean, he still has to
run it up the flagpole,

18:38.481 --> 18:40.649
but he seemed really positive
about it.

18:40.683 --> 18:42.818
And just think ... once I have
a regular paycheck coming in,

18:42.852 --> 18:45.787
you know, you can relax a little bit,
spend more time with the kids.

18:45.822 --> 18:47.095
Who knows? One day, be able
to quit working altogether.

18:47.120 --> 18:48.156
Yeah. Kyle...

18:48.157 --> 18:49.658
Oh, hey, boss...

18:49.692 --> 18:51.193
I'm gonna get us
some detergent.

18:51.227 --> 18:52.794
Thanks, Michelle.

18:52.829 --> 18:55.197
Did she just call you
"boss"?

18:55.231 --> 18:57.466
Uh, yeah.

18:57.500 --> 19:00.002
Um...That is something
I wanted to talk to you about.

19:00.036 --> 19:02.905
See, the cutting back on hours
and quitting thing

19:02.939 --> 19:05.874
is gonna be real tough
because, um...

19:05.909 --> 19:08.644
I'm pretty close
to owning the place.

19:08.678 --> 19:10.913
Owning? Wow. Really?
Well, I did it for our family.

19:10.947 --> 19:12.804
No, of course. I get it.
I'm impressed.

19:12.829 --> 19:13.348
Really?

19:13.349 --> 19:15.384
Yeah. I mean, I don't know
why you felt like

19:15.418 --> 19:17.319
you couldn't tell me
any of this sooner.

19:17.353 --> 19:20.422
Congratulations.

19:20.456 --> 19:22.191
I mean, that's great.
I'm really proud of you.

19:22.225 --> 19:25.894
Thank you.
That ... that means a lot.

19:27.564 --> 19:29.832
Thank you
for coming over on a Sunday

19:29.866 --> 19:31.834
to work your magic on me.

19:31.868 --> 19:33.669
Of course ...
anything for your big day.

19:33.704 --> 19:36.272
Harold's family ...
they're coming in by the dozens.

19:36.307 --> 19:38.775
This is very nice to get away
from the craziness.

19:38.809 --> 19:41.043
Ooh, is this your first time
meeting them? That's exciting.

19:41.078 --> 19:43.045
More like nerve-wracking,
if you ask me.

19:43.080 --> 19:44.580
Oh, they are gonna
love you.

19:44.615 --> 19:46.415
Yeah, but what if
I don't love them?

19:46.450 --> 19:47.783
You know, it goes both ways.

19:47.818 --> 19:49.218
That's true.

19:49.252 --> 19:51.053
I mean, you're not
just marrying Harold.

19:51.087 --> 19:52.688
You're marrying
his whole family.

19:52.722 --> 19:56.625
Um...I don't mean to pry
into your private business ...

19:56.659 --> 19:58.260
but you're going to anyway.

19:58.295 --> 20:01.297
Well, you had any luck,
you know, summoning the stork?

20:01.331 --> 20:03.098
Not yet.

20:03.133 --> 20:05.967
But Dale's insisting that
we just take a break and relax.

20:06.002 --> 20:07.569
Of course,
his idea of relaxing

20:07.603 --> 20:09.270
is taking me
to the batting cages.

20:09.305 --> 20:10.371
Batting cages?

20:10.406 --> 20:12.240
Oh, yeah.
Just you wait.

20:12.274 --> 20:14.475
You know, marriage is
one big slog into compromise.

20:14.509 --> 20:15.810
Ohh!

20:15.844 --> 20:17.711
But it's
a wonderful compromise.

20:17.746 --> 20:20.948
I mean, I wouldn't give up those
batting cages for the world.

20:20.982 --> 20:22.082
Ohh!

20:22.116 --> 20:25.385
Wow,
you are a beautiful bride.

20:25.420 --> 20:28.255
Ohh.
Come on. Cheers.

20:33.795 --> 20:35.496
I'm glad you're in
better spirits.

20:35.531 --> 20:38.399
First lesson of fire training
is to get back on your ladder.

20:38.433 --> 20:41.069
Yeah. So, you're testing the waters?
Mmm.

20:41.103 --> 20:44.406
You know that whole
women-loving-firefighters thing?

20:44.441 --> 20:46.675
Oh, that's not just a myth?
Nope.

20:46.709 --> 20:49.111
It's the number-one
female fantasy.

20:49.145 --> 20:52.147
Well, I am here to confirm.

20:52.182 --> 20:54.851
You know,
speaking of fantasies,

20:54.885 --> 20:58.355
today,
it is all about yours.

21:00.858 --> 21:04.193
* You better watch out,
'cause here I come *

21:04.228 --> 21:07.864
* yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah *

21:07.898 --> 21:11.133
My neck feels pretty loose.
Not to me.

21:11.168 --> 21:12.435
You can move on.

21:12.469 --> 21:13.937
I came here
for something special.

21:13.971 --> 21:15.205
Mm. Sure.

21:15.239 --> 21:18.041
Hot stones will be good.

21:18.075 --> 21:21.044
Look...

21:21.079 --> 21:23.313
It's not my neck
that's stiff.

21:23.347 --> 21:26.682
I think
I can help with that.

21:26.717 --> 21:28.217
Yeah?

21:28.252 --> 21:29.485
Ohh!

21:29.519 --> 21:32.687
Ouch.

21:32.722 --> 21:34.890
He's gonna be really mad tomorrow.
You perv!

21:34.924 --> 21:37.658
Do you realize
you just hit a police officer?

21:37.693 --> 21:39.860
My mother brought me up
to be a lady.

21:39.895 --> 21:40.828
In that outfit?!

21:40.862 --> 21:42.162
Of course I wear this.

21:42.197 --> 21:43.564
It gets me bigger tips.

21:43.598 --> 21:45.165
Is his nose bleeding?

21:45.200 --> 21:47.067
I think
you broke my nose.

21:47.101 --> 21:49.570
You're lucky
that's all I broke.

21:49.604 --> 21:52.540
Whoa, whoa.
Uh...W-where are my clothes?

21:52.574 --> 21:54.475
Well, that's one down.

21:54.509 --> 21:58.813
So, Nate,
what do you do ... for work?

21:58.847 --> 22:01.416
I'm in construction.
I'm a site manager.

22:01.450 --> 22:05.420
Climb a lot of scaffolding,
so my calves get pretty tight.

22:05.454 --> 22:07.488
Ah. I see that.

22:07.522 --> 22:09.390
I've been working like crazy,

22:09.424 --> 22:11.692
trying to keep my mind off
of my ex.

22:11.727 --> 22:13.027
We work together,

22:13.062 --> 22:15.529
so she thinks that makes things
complicated.

22:15.564 --> 22:17.664
Female construction worker?

22:17.699 --> 22:19.233
Must be tough girl.

22:19.267 --> 22:21.668
Oh, she's an architect.

22:21.703 --> 22:23.503
Much smarter than me.

22:23.537 --> 22:24.871
Prettier, too.

22:24.905 --> 22:26.706
You find new girl.

22:26.741 --> 22:30.677
Well, see, that's the thing ...
I only want her.

22:30.711 --> 22:37.717
I mean, she's adorable,
sweet, funny, down to earth.

22:37.752 --> 22:39.719
Why not tell her
you think this?

22:39.754 --> 22:41.021
I am.

22:41.055 --> 22:43.457
Doing my best.

22:43.491 --> 22:45.592
Anya make you feel better.

22:45.626 --> 22:47.394
Nate feel very good.

22:50.298 --> 22:51.664
What do you have in mind?

22:53.467 --> 22:55.568
Didn't know Parks
was such a Romeo.

22:55.602 --> 22:58.905
I take it you're Juliet?

23:03.977 --> 23:05.311
Yes.
There it is. We got her.

23:05.346 --> 23:07.714
Beaumont police.
Son of a bitch.

23:07.748 --> 23:09.650
You are under arrest.

23:09.684 --> 23:10.985
Sorry excuse for a man.

23:11.019 --> 23:12.787
You can't keep
your girlfriend happy.

23:12.821 --> 23:13.988
How can that be?

23:14.023 --> 23:15.757
Please tell me
you're on Pinterest,

23:15.791 --> 23:18.093
looking up flowers
that arrange themselves.

23:18.127 --> 23:20.595
No. I'm sorry.
Mama's rehab bill is due today.

23:20.630 --> 23:21.596
That is so weird.

23:21.631 --> 23:22.998
Is everything okay?

23:23.032 --> 23:24.600
It's saying
that it was paid.

23:24.634 --> 23:26.301
A mistake actually went
in my direction.

23:26.336 --> 23:28.137
I mean, I'm sure it'll come back
and bite me in the ass, but ...

23:28.171 --> 23:29.905
Don't question
a good thing.

23:29.939 --> 23:31.273
Now come on.
Get back over here

23:31.307 --> 23:32.808
and help me finish
these last few arrangements.

23:32.843 --> 23:34.510
I-I don't even remember
paying it.

23:34.545 --> 23:36.979
It's like my brain is
in a million different places.

23:37.014 --> 23:38.581
Well, when Georgia's
wedding's over,

23:38.615 --> 23:39.948
you'll have
more brain space.

23:39.983 --> 23:41.583
I mean, you've been
killing yourself.

23:41.617 --> 23:43.619
Speaking of which, uh, Kyle...

23:43.653 --> 23:45.488
came to the Rub last night.

23:45.522 --> 23:46.622
Oh, no, he didn't.

23:46.657 --> 23:48.257
Oh, yes, he did.

23:48.291 --> 23:50.326
And he said that if he gets
this job, I should quit mine.

23:50.360 --> 23:52.161
Oh, no, he didn't.
Mm-hmm.

23:52.196 --> 23:53.930
Well, one way to stop
your two worlds from colliding

23:53.964 --> 23:55.198
is to get rid of one.

23:55.232 --> 23:57.099
Yeah, except that world
feeds my kids.

23:57.134 --> 23:58.301
Yeah, but if Kyle
moves back home...

23:58.335 --> 24:00.036
He'll be living with
a lying whore.

24:00.071 --> 24:02.105
Oh, no, you did not.

24:02.140 --> 24:03.674
Oh, yes, I just did.

24:06.044 --> 24:07.545
- Hey!
- Hey, there.

24:07.579 --> 24:09.213
Oh!
Don't you look handsome?

24:09.248 --> 24:10.515
Thank you. You do, too.

24:10.549 --> 24:12.217
All right.

24:12.251 --> 24:13.451
I'm gonna start taking this out to the car.
Okay.

24:13.486 --> 24:14.819
You know what?

24:14.853 --> 24:16.654
I need your help with the cake.
Let's go.

24:19.091 --> 24:21.192
Wow. What is this ...
an intergalactic wedding?

24:21.227 --> 24:22.627
You know what?
It's a long story.

24:22.662 --> 24:24.162
Now just help me
get this to the car.

24:24.197 --> 24:25.497
Okay.
Oh, my gosh.

24:25.531 --> 24:27.799
Whoa!
Sorry.

24:27.834 --> 24:30.836
All right.
So, I was wondering ...

24:30.870 --> 24:32.838
did you not tell me
about taking over the Rub

24:32.872 --> 24:35.074
because I'm having a hard time
finding a job?

24:35.108 --> 24:37.143
Because you know
you don't have to protect me.

24:37.177 --> 24:38.678
You know what?
I'm sorry, okay?

24:38.712 --> 24:40.713
I should have told you.
I just made a mistake.

24:40.747 --> 24:42.181
Will you be careful, please?
No. I'm just saying,

24:42.215 --> 24:43.649
you know, if, you know,
we're gonna move forward,

24:43.684 --> 24:44.884
we have to start being honest
with each other.

24:44.918 --> 24:46.485
What we need to do
is slow down.

24:46.520 --> 24:47.887
I thought we were trying to take
the next step.

24:47.921 --> 24:49.488
We're just going too fast.

24:49.523 --> 24:51.491
But trust is a two-way st...
I am talking about the cake.

24:51.525 --> 24:52.692
Oh.

24:52.726 --> 24:54.393
Oh, wait.

24:54.428 --> 24:56.395
Are you kidding me?
It might be the job.

24:58.198 --> 25:00.667
Hello?

25:00.701 --> 25:01.701
Yes.

25:01.735 --> 25:03.536
Oh, I see.

25:03.571 --> 25:04.938
Thank you.

25:07.241 --> 25:09.443
They did a background check.

25:09.477 --> 25:11.211
I didn't get the job.

25:11.246 --> 25:12.612
Oh, Kyle, I'm so sorry.

25:12.646 --> 25:13.580
Ohh!
Aaah!

25:17.885 --> 25:20.153
Ohh.

25:27.061 --> 25:28.562
If you can't afford one,

25:28.596 --> 25:30.264
one will be appointed to you
at government expense.

25:30.298 --> 25:32.199
Do you understand these rights
as I have read them to you?

25:32.234 --> 25:34.268
Do you?
Yes.

25:38.007 --> 25:40.242
What happened to you?

25:40.276 --> 25:41.944
Shut up.

25:44.247 --> 25:45.580
Really?

25:45.615 --> 25:48.082
You won't talk to me
in person.

25:48.117 --> 25:49.951
Yeah, and after that stunt,
that's not gonna change.

25:49.985 --> 25:51.452
Congratulations
on the arrest.

25:58.514 --> 26:00.003
Ugh.
I can't believe this.

26:00.004 --> 26:01.972
I promised Georgia
I'd help her

26:02.006 --> 26:03.841
with her wedding cake,
and I ruined it.

26:03.875 --> 26:06.544
No, we ruined it.
Okay? Accidents happen.

26:06.578 --> 26:09.314
What matters
is how we go about fixing it.

26:09.348 --> 26:11.316
You got the eggs?
Oh, yeah.

26:15.154 --> 26:17.355
All right.
So, you you one at a time,

26:17.389 --> 26:20.191
and then you stir the butter in
intermittently.

26:20.225 --> 26:22.627
Who are you, and what have you
done with Kyle?

26:22.661 --> 26:23.828
Impressed?

26:23.862 --> 26:26.865
Yeah,
I'm a little impressed.

26:26.899 --> 26:29.338
You know, one of the things that
I remember most about my mom...

26:29.363 --> 26:30.435
Mm-hmm?

26:30.436 --> 26:32.804
...is she always said that boys
should know how to bake.

26:32.838 --> 26:34.839
Ooh. Well, I hope
she also taught you miracles,

26:34.873 --> 26:37.241
because Georgia's wedding
is in one hour.

26:37.276 --> 26:39.476
It's all right.
We're gonna be good.

26:39.511 --> 26:42.379
Plus, when all else fails,
icing is like spackle ...

26:42.414 --> 26:43.814
it fixes everything.

26:48.452 --> 26:51.187
Okay. Georgia has locked herself
in the back room,

26:51.221 --> 26:52.655
and she won't come out.

26:52.689 --> 26:54.756
Okay. Well, go. Go.
I got this under control.

26:54.791 --> 26:57.059
All right.
I'm just gonna get ready.

26:57.093 --> 26:58.927
You're gonna find
a great job.

27:02.466 --> 27:04.233
* I was walkin' *

27:04.268 --> 27:05.868
Sweetie, hey.

27:05.903 --> 27:08.171
Oh, thank God you're here.
We've tried everything.

27:08.205 --> 27:11.675
Yeah, yeah. I got this.
* it was in the shape of a heart *

27:11.709 --> 27:14.277
* then something
occurred to me *

27:14.312 --> 27:15.746
* I think you're the one... *
Georgia?

27:15.780 --> 27:17.947
* ...where I want to be *

27:23.252 --> 27:24.686
We can still have a party.

27:24.720 --> 27:27.222
No sense in all this good food
going to waste.

27:27.257 --> 27:28.791
Okay, what is going on?

27:28.825 --> 27:30.960
Is this what they call
getting cold feet?

27:30.994 --> 27:33.429
Hey, would you talk to me,
please?

27:33.463 --> 27:36.031
Honey, I don't think
I ever told you

27:36.066 --> 27:38.201
what happened
with my first husband.

27:38.235 --> 27:42.438
The Rub girl he ran off with
was a legit massage therapist,

27:42.473 --> 27:45.742
and, uh, she found out what was
going on behind closed doors.

27:45.776 --> 27:48.278
She always had her eye
on Robert.

27:48.312 --> 27:50.446
And as soon as she got
some ammunition...

27:50.481 --> 27:51.414
Okay, Georgia.

27:51.448 --> 27:53.483
You're just afraid...

27:53.517 --> 27:56.653
That Harold's gonna find out
your secret, and I get that.

27:56.688 --> 27:58.655
But that's why
you got out.

27:58.689 --> 28:01.925
It's just now I got all these
other worries bubbling up,

28:01.960 --> 28:03.127
and I can't ...

28:03.161 --> 28:05.429
Okay, will you just come
and sit down?

28:05.463 --> 28:07.297
Don't be difficult.
Just sit.

28:07.332 --> 28:08.499
Here.

28:08.533 --> 28:12.102
Take another sip of this.

28:13.171 --> 28:14.839
Now close your eyes.

28:14.873 --> 28:16.774
Don't make it weird.
Just close 'em.

28:16.809 --> 28:18.477
Okay.
Okay.

28:18.511 --> 28:21.313
Now picture
the moment you met Harold.

28:22.482 --> 28:24.449
That's good.
I like that smile.

28:24.484 --> 28:25.851
Now tell me about it.

28:25.885 --> 28:27.519
Well, the church was full.

28:27.554 --> 28:29.688
I was late.
I couldn't find a seat.

28:29.723 --> 28:32.091
Oh, and then out of the blue

28:32.125 --> 28:35.294
This beautiful man
gave me his.

28:35.329 --> 28:38.831
His smile
was like a sign from God.

28:38.866 --> 28:41.267
Or maybe it was the devil
himself trying to tempt me

28:41.301 --> 28:42.969
into making the same mistake
twice.

28:43.003 --> 28:45.138
Georgia, will you focus, please?
We've already been over this.

28:45.172 --> 28:46.206
Keep going.

28:46.240 --> 28:47.975
Okay.

28:48.009 --> 28:51.811
After the service, we had
burnt coffee in the courtyard.

28:51.846 --> 28:55.815
But I'm telling you, standing
next to that man ... mm ...

28:55.849 --> 28:58.684
that was the best-tasting coffee
I'd ever had.

28:58.719 --> 29:00.386
He felt the same way.

29:00.420 --> 29:05.324
You know, you can just get
caught up in all of the romance.

29:05.359 --> 29:09.728
My first marriage,
my first husband ...

29:09.763 --> 29:12.465
I thought it was true love.
Thought it was for keeps.

29:12.499 --> 29:15.401
Georgia,
Harold's not your ex, okay?

29:15.436 --> 29:17.996
You just have to trust that it's
not gonna be that way this time.

29:18.005 --> 29:22.242
Yeah, but it's normal
for the honeymoon phase to fade,

29:22.277 --> 29:27.048
and I just wonder, will Harold's
love for me fade along with it?

29:27.082 --> 29:28.383
Has it yet?

29:28.417 --> 29:31.686
Every day we're together ...
oh, I ...

29:31.721 --> 29:34.022
my love for him
grows so much,

29:34.056 --> 29:36.391
sometimes I feel like
my heart's gonna burst.

29:36.425 --> 29:38.226
He feels the same way.

29:38.260 --> 29:40.362
I can see it in his eyes.
Ohh.

29:40.396 --> 29:42.430
You know something?

29:42.465 --> 29:45.833
You are damn good.

29:45.868 --> 29:49.204
All this wedding fuss
has just driven me crazy.

29:49.238 --> 29:51.573
Guess I lost sight of us.

29:51.607 --> 29:53.675
Which is the only thing
that matters.

29:53.710 --> 29:56.011
Mmm.

29:56.045 --> 30:00.549
I will marry you right here,
right now,

30:00.584 --> 30:02.118
without all the bells
and whistles.

30:02.152 --> 30:04.720
I thought you wanted
bells and whistles.

30:04.755 --> 30:06.589
No.
I only want to marry you.

30:06.623 --> 30:08.891
And you know what?
I'm gonna prove it.

30:08.925 --> 30:12.294
Let's do it right this second,
right now.

30:12.328 --> 30:13.729
Really?
Yes.

30:13.763 --> 30:16.733
Okay, you two.
Just hold on.

30:16.767 --> 30:20.503
Oh, Harold.

30:25.476 --> 30:27.043
Excuse me, everybody.

30:27.078 --> 30:28.812
Excuse me.
We have an announcement.

30:28.846 --> 30:31.882
We would like to introduce
Mr. and Mrs. Clemens.

30:33.151 --> 30:35.620
We couldn't wait!
We're already married!

30:35.654 --> 30:37.755
We did it! We did it!

30:43.263 --> 30:45.665
Let's party!

30:54.507 --> 30:57.075
Whoo-hoo!

30:57.110 --> 30:59.444
Okay!

31:00.780 --> 31:03.282
How'd you get into
this country?

31:03.316 --> 31:05.084
We know you're not legal.

31:05.118 --> 31:08.454
Let's talk about
the Lucky Lotus.

31:08.488 --> 31:09.855
What can you tell me
about your boss?

31:09.890 --> 31:11.924
You're gonna
want to talk to me.

31:11.959 --> 31:15.929
Solicitation and prostitution ...
that's 14 months.

31:15.963 --> 31:18.601
I talk, it's dangerous.

31:18.635 --> 31:22.070
Boss knows many people ...
I-important people.

31:23.039 --> 31:24.139
Cops.

31:24.174 --> 31:26.441
Cops?

31:26.476 --> 31:29.311
You're saying it's one of us
that's on the force?

31:29.345 --> 31:30.712
I'm saying I can't say.

31:30.747 --> 31:33.115
You ever seen
an immigration detention center?

31:33.149 --> 31:37.352
The nicest thing we could do
is send you back to Siberia.

31:37.386 --> 31:38.786
I mean, that's where
you're from, right?

31:38.821 --> 31:41.622
You can't send me back there,
please.

31:41.656 --> 31:44.692
Well, I-I don't see
anybody coming to your rescue,

31:44.726 --> 31:47.562
so you might want to think about
helping yourself.

31:51.166 --> 31:54.468
Greg Carlyle
is who I work for.

31:54.502 --> 31:57.037
Greg Carlyle owns
the Lucky Lotus?

31:59.240 --> 32:00.741
What more can you tell me?

32:00.775 --> 32:03.877
What else information
you want?

32:03.911 --> 32:08.147
Lucky Lotus clients?
Code to safe? I give you.

32:08.182 --> 32:11.050
First, I want
"Get Out of Prison Free" card ...

32:11.084 --> 32:12.418
and lawyer.

32:12.452 --> 32:15.321
Let me see what I can do.

32:15.356 --> 32:17.490
Let's go.

32:17.524 --> 32:20.527
She's a tough cookie.

32:20.561 --> 32:21.928
I wasn't alone, you know.

32:21.963 --> 32:23.397
The boss heard everything.

32:23.431 --> 32:24.264
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have ...

32:24.299 --> 32:25.766
Said all that. Exactly.

32:25.800 --> 32:28.102
Exposing my underbelly makes me
an easy target.

32:28.136 --> 32:30.537
What choice did I have?
You won't talk to me.

32:30.572 --> 32:33.039
Come on. Shelby,
can we just forget about

32:33.074 --> 32:35.942
my stupid surveillance
confession and start over?

32:35.976 --> 32:37.677
I wish I could.

32:37.711 --> 32:40.513
The only reason you want me is
because you can't have Riley.

32:40.547 --> 32:42.081
I don't want Riley.

32:42.115 --> 32:43.683
You do.

32:43.717 --> 32:45.718
That's why you had me spin
the incident reports for her.

32:45.752 --> 32:47.886
She's family, all right?
We have a lot of history.

32:47.921 --> 32:50.956
I saw your face the night
of the reunion at the station.

32:50.991 --> 32:52.725
You've been in love with her
since high school.

32:52.759 --> 32:54.126
I'm trying to move on.

32:54.160 --> 32:56.195
I don't want to be
anybody's second choice.

32:56.229 --> 32:57.529
You shouldn't have to try.

32:57.564 --> 33:00.099
Look, Shelby,
I can't just flip a switch

33:00.133 --> 33:03.101
and turn off
the last 15 years.

33:03.136 --> 33:05.137
But I made my choice.

33:05.171 --> 33:07.806
And I want you.

33:07.840 --> 33:11.109
Can't we just start over fresh,
forget everything?

33:11.144 --> 33:14.245
I don't think
we should do this anymore.

33:14.280 --> 33:16.281
You don't even want to
think about it?

33:16.315 --> 33:18.950
Our time together was...

33:21.153 --> 33:22.620
I can't be with you.

33:22.655 --> 33:24.489
Just hear me out.

33:24.523 --> 33:27.658
I got feelings for you ...
strong feelings.

33:27.693 --> 33:30.761
And had I known our last kiss
was gonna be our very last,

33:30.795 --> 33:32.863
I'd have made sure
you never forgot it.

33:48.956 --> 33:50.190
Hey.

33:50.224 --> 33:51.572
Where's your guitar?

33:51.573 --> 33:53.074
I sold it.

33:53.108 --> 33:54.575
Why would you do that?
You loved that guitar.

33:54.609 --> 33:56.877
It's just a thing.
Kyle.

33:56.911 --> 33:59.246
Just wanted to help out.

33:59.281 --> 34:01.082
Oh, my God.

34:01.116 --> 34:04.452
You sold your guitar
to help pay mama's rehab bill.

34:05.855 --> 34:07.856
Well, look at you.

34:17.534 --> 34:20.703
Okay. So, this song
is for Georgia and Harold,

34:20.737 --> 34:22.405
'cause they're the only two people
that got married here tonight,

34:22.438 --> 34:23.906
right? That's right.

34:24.942 --> 34:26.175
Okay.

34:26.210 --> 34:28.210
Happy couple
that we both look up to.

34:28.245 --> 34:30.079
Lacey Jean, get up here.
I need you.

34:30.114 --> 34:31.581
Come on.
Don't be shy. Come on.

34:32.650 --> 34:34.417
All right, here it goes.

34:38.722 --> 34:45.094
* It's amazing how you
can speak right to my heart *

34:49.900 --> 34:57.808
* Without saying a word,
you can light up the dark *

34:57.842 --> 35:00.110
You ever think you're looking
for something that doesn't exist?

35:00.144 --> 35:01.444
All the time.

35:01.478 --> 35:03.579
* Try as I may,
I could never explain *

35:03.614 --> 35:05.581
Here's to
never getting married ... again.

35:05.615 --> 35:07.149
Hey! You know what?

35:07.183 --> 35:08.650
* What I hear
when you don't say a thing *

35:08.685 --> 35:10.419
I'm not toasting to that.
Wait, you?

35:10.453 --> 35:13.289
What?
Is it so hard to believe

35:13.323 --> 35:15.124
that I buy into
the fairy tale ...

35:15.158 --> 35:18.728
that I would want a best friend
and a partner

35:18.762 --> 35:20.897
to fall in love with
and grow old with?

35:20.931 --> 35:22.932
* Sayin'
you'll never leave me *

35:22.966 --> 35:25.935
Wow. I've missed the mark with you.

35:25.969 --> 35:29.005
Look, I'm not holding my breath
for it or anything.

35:29.040 --> 35:31.442
How can I?
With our job?

35:31.476 --> 35:33.611
The secrets?
God, no.

35:33.645 --> 35:36.680
* You say it best *
I'm not really, uh...

35:36.714 --> 35:39.249
Marriage material.
* when you say nothing at all *

35:39.283 --> 35:41.818
Unless you found someone
who understands all that

35:41.853 --> 35:45.121
and accepts you...completely.

35:45.156 --> 35:47.924
* All day long, I can hear... *

35:47.959 --> 35:51.695
Excuse me.
* ...People talking out loud *

35:51.729 --> 35:53.296
I've had my eye on you
all night.

35:53.331 --> 35:55.666
Oh.

35:55.700 --> 35:58.969
Do you want to dance?
* but when you pull me near *

35:59.004 --> 36:01.471
* you drown out the crowd *

36:01.506 --> 36:04.541
Actually, um,
my dance card's all full.

36:04.575 --> 36:06.977
Thank you.

36:07.011 --> 36:10.514
* Old Mr. Webster could never define *
really?

36:10.548 --> 36:13.784
You'd pick me...
Over that guy?

36:13.818 --> 36:15.790
* What's being said
between your heart and mine *

36:15.815 --> 36:17.815
Bull's-eye.

36:19.190 --> 36:25.195
* The smile on your face le*

36:25.230 --> 36:31.001
* there's a truth in your eyes
sayin' you'll never leave me *

36:31.035 --> 36:32.903
* the touch of your hand *

36:32.937 --> 36:39.143
* says you'll catch me
if ever I fa-a-a-a-ll *

36:39.177 --> 36:42.713
* you say it best *

36:42.747 --> 36:47.084
* when you say nothing at all *

36:50.589 --> 36:53.657
* you say it best *

36:53.692 --> 36:59.464
* when you say nothing at all *

37:08.207 --> 37:09.341
High fives.
Yes.

37:11.544 --> 37:13.745
In sports, the national hockey
league featured a busy f...

37:16.215 --> 37:19.584
Welcome to the season
finale of "Sewing Wars."

37:19.619 --> 37:22.220
The battle of the stitches heats up...

37:22.255 --> 37:24.656
...as carlene and mavis
go head-to-head.

37:26.826 --> 37:29.094
Hey.
What are you doing here?

37:29.129 --> 37:31.597
I think I want
another last kiss.

37:31.631 --> 37:32.764
Okay.

37:32.799 --> 37:34.733
And another.

37:34.767 --> 37:36.735
And another.

37:39.305 --> 37:40.973
Does this mean...

37:41.007 --> 37:43.087
We're partners on and off
the force, so stop talking.

37:45.478 --> 37:47.413
...sewing
complicated garments

37:47.447 --> 37:49.782
on 1961 vintage
singer featherweights.

37:49.816 --> 37:50.783
"Sewing Wars"?

37:52.819 --> 37:53.786
Yeah.

37:56.089 --> 37:58.491
Why is Dale so excited
about this baseball game?

37:58.525 --> 38:00.226
Because he's Dale.

38:00.260 --> 38:02.261
I mean, I love baseball,
but I'd rather watch it on TV.

38:02.296 --> 38:04.163
Oh, in the air-conditioning.
Oh, with a beer.

38:04.198 --> 38:05.665
And nachos.
Ohh.

38:05.699 --> 38:08.000
Dale thinks that acting like
his 10-year-old self

38:08.035 --> 38:09.803
is supposed to cheer me up
somehow.

38:09.837 --> 38:11.805
He even took me
to the batting cages.

38:11.839 --> 38:13.840
Well, got to love that husband of yours.
I know.

38:13.874 --> 38:16.032
Speaking of husbands,
yours baked a wedding cake.

38:16.033 --> 38:16.810
I know, right?

38:16.811 --> 38:18.512
All calm, cool, and collected.

38:18.547 --> 38:21.816
Oh, and he sold his favorite
guitar for mama's rehab bill.

38:21.850 --> 38:23.517
That was him?

38:23.552 --> 38:25.787
Wow. He really is
trying to win you back.

38:25.821 --> 38:29.390
Yeah. I guess you got to love
that husband of mine.

38:31.160 --> 38:33.461
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

38:33.495 --> 38:35.162
Okay, wait.
It's gonna get steep here.

38:35.197 --> 38:36.464
Be careful.
Geez.

38:36.498 --> 38:37.765
Careful. You ready?
We're going fast.

38:37.800 --> 38:39.320
Yeah, I'm ready.
You sure you're ready?

38:39.335 --> 38:40.502
I'm ready!
I don't think you're ready.

38:40.536 --> 38:42.203
Take it off! I'm ready.
All right.

38:42.238 --> 38:45.174
* Hey, I'm calling out to... *
Okay, I don't get it.

38:45.208 --> 38:47.176
I thought we were going to see
a baseball game.

38:47.210 --> 38:48.310
Did you get the date wrong?

38:48.345 --> 38:50.479
No, he didn't, Lace.

38:50.513 --> 38:52.147
No. We're gonna ... we're gonna
play a game of our own.

38:53.016 --> 38:54.817
Um, okay.

38:54.851 --> 38:57.219
Still not getting it.

38:57.254 --> 38:58.847
Well, you did marry
a man of mystery.

38:58.872 --> 38:59.689
True.

38:59.690 --> 39:01.658
That I know.

39:01.692 --> 39:04.361
Dennis, come on, buddy!

39:04.395 --> 39:05.895
* Sink or swim *

39:05.929 --> 39:08.064
Turn around.

39:09.866 --> 39:11.967
* So keep your eyes open *

39:12.002 --> 39:15.204
Oh, my God.
I forgot our anniversary.

39:15.238 --> 39:17.039
Oh, my God.
Oh, no. Come on.

39:17.073 --> 39:20.009
You've been preoccupied.
I'm so sorry.

39:20.043 --> 39:22.344
Come on. I didn't do this
to make you feel sorry.

39:22.379 --> 39:25.381
Ugh, Dale, will you just
get to it already?!

39:25.415 --> 39:26.348
Get to what?

39:26.383 --> 39:28.184
Best man?
Best man?

39:28.218 --> 39:30.653
* All signs point to yes *

39:30.687 --> 39:33.489
Thank you, sir.
You're welcome.

39:35.859 --> 39:38.394
Lacey Jean Locklin...

39:38.428 --> 39:41.063
When I originally
proposed to you...

39:41.098 --> 39:44.433
Back in the stone age?
Yes.

39:44.468 --> 39:49.205
...I-I couldn't afford
the ring that you deserve.

39:54.744 --> 39:57.746
Oh, my God.

39:57.780 --> 40:00.182
Lacey, the man just asked you
a question on a scoreboard.

40:00.216 --> 40:01.516
What's your answer?

40:01.551 --> 40:04.686
Yes, yes, yes.
Yes?

40:04.720 --> 40:06.254
Yes.
Whoo!

40:06.289 --> 40:07.522
Whoo-whoo!

40:07.556 --> 40:10.191
Yeah!

40:10.225 --> 40:12.894
Boy, I tell you ...
it's hard to follow his logic,

40:12.928 --> 40:15.096
but the man does get results.
He does.

40:15.130 --> 40:16.731
Oh, wait, wait.
Let's get this.

40:16.765 --> 40:18.132
So beautiful.
Oh, my God.

40:18.167 --> 40:19.233
We got to get this moment.

40:19.268 --> 40:20.935
Ready? Smile.

40:22.938 --> 40:26.240
"Check out my bold maneuver."

40:26.275 --> 40:28.075
Bold maneuver?

40:28.110 --> 40:30.278
Stop talking.

40:36.285 --> 40:37.384
Here we go! Ready?!

40:37.419 --> 40:38.719
You two ain't gonna win.

40:38.753 --> 40:40.121
Okay, Lacey Jean!
Let's go!

40:40.155 --> 40:41.516
Bring it home, Kyle!
Bring it home!

40:41.523 --> 40:42.890
We're gonna beat
their butts!

40:42.925 --> 40:44.992
- Oh, here it comes.
- Here it comes.

40:45.027 --> 40:46.594
Ready?
Let's go. I'm hungry.

40:46.629 --> 40:47.962
Spit ball?

40:47.997 --> 40:49.463
Yeah!

40:49.498 --> 40:51.599
Ooh!

40:51.633 --> 40:52.994
Oh, get it, get it,
get it, get it!

40:53.002 --> 40:54.736
Okay, okay, okay! Hold on!
Get him!

40:54.770 --> 40:56.837
Wait! Hey!
What are you doing?!

40:56.871 --> 40:57.738
You can't...

40:57.772 --> 40:59.907
Aaah!

41:01.610 --> 41:03.511
* Baby, baby, close your eyes *

41:03.545 --> 41:06.180
I want you to come home.

41:06.214 --> 41:08.349
* I want you *

41:08.384 --> 41:10.585
* I want you *

41:10.619 --> 41:13.822
* I want, want you,
want you, want you *

41:15.356 --> 41:17.858
They're falling.

41:20.895 --> 41:23.530
Dale did good.

41:23.564 --> 41:25.532
Lacey looked so happy.

41:25.566 --> 41:28.101
Yeah.
I know the feeling.

41:29.403 --> 41:30.896
You know,
I didn't want to ...

41:30.897 --> 41:33.131
I didn't want to step
on Dale's bold maneuver earlier.

41:38.238 --> 41:39.505
Whenever you're ready.

41:39.539 --> 41:42.408
Kyle...

41:50.732 --> 41:51.615
In local news,

41:51.616 --> 41:53.962
a Beaumont massage parlor
was raided today.

41:54.116 --> 41:55.983
Undercover officers arrested
several girls

41:56.018 --> 41:58.413
under suspicion
of prostitution.

41:58.648 --> 42:01.316
Officials are saying this bust is
a part of a larger investigation

42:01.350 --> 42:04.352
scheduled to ramp up
across the state.
