WEBVTT

00:03.700 --> 00:05.500
Laverne is so annoying,

00:05.500 --> 00:07.800
why does Shirley keep putting up with her crap?

00:09.400 --> 00:11.600
Well, she has to there in love

00:15.000 --> 00:18.100
Again, Kelso, Laverne and Shirley are not Lesbians

00:19.800 --> 00:23.600
trust me, there one bottle of wine away
from making out...

00:25.400 --> 00:26.800
just like you two!

00:28.800 --> 00:31.700
Kelso, don’t you have something more important
to talk about right now?

00:31.700 --> 00:35.600
If you got a topic more important than
girl on girl action I’d like to hear it

00:37.000 --> 00:41.200
How about the fact that Brooke’s got your
feeble-minded bun in her oven

00:42.100 --> 00:45.600
Look, she cant be pregnant, okay?
It just cant be true

00:45.600 --> 00:48.100
Michael, this is not something girls lie about, okay?

00:48.300 --> 00:50.900
I would know,
I’m an expert on girl lies

00:52.100 --> 00:55.100
Kelso, your gonna have to do something about this

00:55.200 --> 00:57.300
No, but doing something is not in my nature

00:57.600 --> 01:01.000
“Ignore,” “Avoid“, “Run away”,
these words have been very good to me

01:03.100 --> 01:05.200
- You’re horrible
- What a pig

01:05.400 --> 01:08.900
You know what?
You girls don’t even know what I’m going through,

01:08.900 --> 01:12.900
you can have all the sex you want and you
don’t have to worry about gettin’Anyone pregnant

01:18.900 --> 01:22.000
Laurie, try these banana walnut pancakes

01:22.000 --> 01:23.800
I know you’ve always had a thing for nuts

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Every man in town knows that

01:28.100 --> 01:31.000
What men?
Oh, never mind!

01:32.700 --> 01:33.700
You guys

01:34.174 --> 01:39.789
an agent from immigration is coming to check on Fez and Laurie’s
marriage and if he finds out it’s fake Fez could deported

01:39.900 --> 01:44.400
- But this marriage is based on love, right, honey?
- don’t touch me

01:44.800 --> 01:47.900
Fine, I’ll give you 20 bucks to pretend to be my wife

01:48.400 --> 01:50.400
That’s gotta sound familiar

01:52.400 --> 01:58.200
Steven, If you keep doing that, its gonna be really hard for me
to pretend I don’t know what your talking about

01:59.500 --> 02:02.100
Then I should go because its just to easy...

02:03.200 --> 02:04.300
Like Laurie.

02:07.500 --> 02:09.600
When is this I.N.S man gonna be here?

02:09.900 --> 02:14.600
Uh, sometime this week, it’s a surprise visit...
So I have to stay here

02:15.000 --> 02:16.200
Stay here?

02:17.800 --> 02:20.500
With, Red?
Oh, no, I cant allow that

02:20.800 --> 02:23.000
Why not?
Red loves me

02:23.500 --> 02:25.600
Honey, you gave him a heart attack

02:26.600 --> 02:31.300
Maybe he just loves Fez so much...
That his heart exploded?

02:33.900 --> 02:36.000
Please, Miss Kitty. Let me stay

02:37.200 --> 02:38.400
Mom, come on

02:39.300 --> 02:42.200
- Okay, you win
- Oh, thank you!

02:43.400 --> 02:46.800
Uh, that was a sexy hug you really put some
boom-boom into it, huh?

03:49.877 --> 03:51.409
What is this doing her?

03:53.200 --> 03:55.900
Okay, Red he just has to stay here for a few days

03:56.272 --> 03:59.308
But Kitty,he was in my shower,

04:00.800 --> 04:02.500
he saw my legs

04:04.600 --> 04:06.800
- And he saw Pepé
- Shut up

04:11.562 --> 04:17.541
Listen, Dad, the I.N.S is coming and if they
found out this marriage is fake, Fez could get deported

04:17.570 --> 04:19.762
Well, that’s Anwar’s problem

04:21.866 --> 04:24.865
Oh, but I cannot go back home, I’m an American now

04:25.005 --> 04:27.256
I’m lazy, fat and soft...

04:28.721 --> 04:29.703
like you!

04:32.661 --> 04:38.419
Look, you deserve what you get!
You tricked Laurie into this mess of a marriage

04:38.863 --> 04:41.284
she’sinnocent and...Naïve.

04:42.545 --> 04:46.073
The only reason she got caught up in this i
because she loves to much

04:49.127 --> 04:51.063
Well that last parts true

04:59.941 --> 05:01.883
Shoot!
It’s Brooke, hide me

05:01.951 --> 05:02.643
Hey!

05:02.985 --> 05:05.613
I’m sorry Donna, squeezing your but gives me courage

05:09.484 --> 05:16.188
So Michael? You split pretty quick the other day...
Maybe we should talk or something?

05:17.131 --> 05:21.284
You got it...One sec

05:24.532 --> 05:25.282
Kelso!

05:26.196 --> 05:29.722
Aah! Donna, Let go of my leg!
I swear I got no problem kickin’ a girl

05:31.149 --> 05:34.206
Look, you’ve done a lot of stupid crap over the years

05:34.267 --> 05:38.285
You stolemy panties,
you tied my hamster to a bottle rocket

05:39.431 --> 05:42.581
And I don’t know how many times
I’ve caught you peeking through my window

05:43.341 --> 05:43.861
Five

05:45.411 --> 05:50.669
Look, the point is, I let it all slide because
underneath I knew you were a good guy,

05:50.884 --> 05:56.361
but if you bail on Brooke, I will never respect you again
and neither will anybody else

05:57.775 --> 06:00.090
Look, I know, ok? I know. I just...

06:00.862 --> 06:02.307
I don’t know what to do

06:03.048 --> 06:04.901
Well, Kelso, you need to go talk to her

06:06.343 --> 06:06.978
Ok

06:09.744 --> 06:14.968
“Touch Donna Pinciottie’s Panties for 5 bucks”
Call,Michael Kelso

06:23.541 --> 06:26.598
And that was the first time I ever tasted chocolate

06:28.412 --> 06:30.485
That’s a great story, man but,

06:31.024 --> 06:35.159
uh, it’s like 2 in the morning so we gotta go to sleep

06:35.250 --> 06:38.311
But I forgot my tape of my ocean sounds

06:40.159 --> 06:42.614
and I cannot fall asleep without it

06:43.675 --> 06:46.212
Can you make ocean sounds for me?

06:48.274 --> 06:49.601
Yeah, I’m not doing that

06:50.417 --> 06:53.968
Okay, then let me tell you about
the first time I ate a blow pop

06:55.494 --> 06:58.182
Lick number one: What a surprise!

07:13.737 --> 07:15.987
You are forgetting the whale songs?

07:18.161 --> 07:20.698
Listen, man, I’ve only been to the ocean once

07:21.244 --> 07:25.176
and the closest thing I saw to a whale
was some fat guy selling drugs

07:25.868 --> 07:29.793
Fine, lick number two still no gum?!

07:49.316 --> 07:51.830
What the hell are you doing to yourself?!

07:52.993 --> 07:57.129
Oh, great, Dad, you know what?
You woke him up, you put him back to sleep!

08:04.800 --> 08:05.500
Hey!

08:09.138 --> 08:13.679
Uh...It’s been pointed out to me that I’ve been
acting a little flaky about, um...

08:14.836 --> 08:16.268
our situation

08:16.268 --> 08:17.709
I disagree,

08:17.821 --> 08:21.835
flakey means your not consistent,
you run away every time you see me

08:23.474 --> 08:27.326
Anyway, I think we should talk about what we’re gonna do

08:27.326 --> 08:33.142
or I’m sure your gonna want me to meet your parents
aaaand lucky for you I look good in a suit

08:34.015 --> 08:36.962
aaaand lucky for you I look good in a suit,
But you already know that, so

08:37.600 --> 08:40.600
Actually, don’t worry about it!

08:41.188 --> 08:44.566
as far as the baby and I are concerned
your off the hook

08:45.463 --> 08:48.005
So your just letting’ me go?

08:48.244 --> 08:51.785
Yep, you don’t have to think about this ever again

08:53.490 --> 08:54.817
And I wont!

08:57.625 --> 09:01.093
WOW! Your like the coolest girl I ever did it
with at a concert!

09:07.734 --> 09:10.284
Oh, honey, you look terrible

09:10.284 --> 09:12.972
Oh, you don’t look so hot yourself, sister

09:15.252 --> 09:16.788
I beg your pardon

09:16.836 --> 09:22.721
Red made me sleep in the basement and every time I started
to fall asleep Hyde would put a popsicle on my neck

09:24.800 --> 09:26.400
That’s my daddy’s chair

09:26.545 --> 09:28.680
"That’s my daddy’s chair"

09:30.281 --> 09:34.561
Fez, look, man you gotta start kissing Red’s butt a little or

09:34.561 --> 09:36.466
he’s gonna make sure you get deported

09:36.600 --> 09:40.635
He should be kissing my butt for taking
his trashy daughter off his hands

09:42.422 --> 09:45.515
I’m not that trashy, I wont sleep with you

09:45.819 --> 09:47.664
Oh, zip it, jezebel

09:51.568 --> 09:54.288
Out of my chair, Tonto

09:56.124 --> 10:01.296
Oh, come on a chair is a chair,
branch out a little try the piano bench

10:01.966 --> 10:03.585
What did you say?!

10:03.585 --> 10:06.123
- Laurie, go get a cup of milk
- Why?

10:06.292 --> 10:09.787
It’ll keep Fez’s teeth alive until we get him to the dentist

10:14.405 --> 10:20.637
Hi, sir, Hal Armstrong from the immigration service,
I’m here to conduct some interviews

10:20.637 --> 10:23.729
What do you want to know, ‘cause I’ll tell you everything

10:25.100 --> 10:27.409
Is it-Is it to late to give you back your chair

10:27.409 --> 10:34.640
Oh, no don’t get up this could be the last time you sit
on furniture that you didn’t build out of mud and twigs

10:43.400 --> 10:49.100
So, Agent Armstrong can’t wait to tell you
all about this marriage, you got handcuffs, right?

10:49.700 --> 10:54.000
Red, Red, why don’t you help me in the kitchen,
Laurie make our guest comfortable

10:54.600 --> 10:56.600
Hey, G-man

10:58.842 --> 11:04.062
Okay, Red, just because he sat in your chair
is no reason to get the boy deported

11:05.432 --> 11:07.658
You don’t like me because I’m not from here

11:08.872 --> 11:12.770
This has nothing to do with you being a foreigner.

11:13.275 --> 11:18.120
It’s about you taking advantage of
my daughter like a sneaky foreigner

11:19.955 --> 11:24.543
Oh, wait, dad, look, I stayed home from college to take care
of you and mom in your hour of need,

11:24.543 --> 11:25.982
okay you owe me!

11:25.982 --> 11:29.186
That is just like a woman to bring that up

11:32.027 --> 11:35.314
You know, Laurie could get in a lot of trouble, too

11:35.314 --> 11:39.014
- What kinda trouble?
- Big trouble, dad, she could go to jail...

11:39.298 --> 11:40.742
or back to jail!

11:42.411 --> 11:46.452
Well, come on,
Its like where has she been for the past two years

11:48.090 --> 11:52.966
All right, fine, I wont volunteer anything but if he asks me
a direct question I’m not lying

11:53.014 --> 11:57.404
- Oh, you wont have to. I’ll do all the talking for you
- Well, you’ll be good at that!

11:58.666 --> 12:07.071
And I guess it might be fun to just sit back and watch Tarzan
here crumble before the full force of the U.S Government

12:08.156 --> 12:14.245
Okay, that’s it. Anwar I can deal with. Tonto, in the ballpark,
but Tarzan...Tarzan is a white guy

12:18.836 --> 12:20.682
Don’t sass me, Tarzan!

12:24.019 --> 12:26.912
Michael, there is no way Brooke said your off the hook,

12:27.049 --> 12:32.526
Okay, I bet she said “I’m gonna take every penny you have
you irresponsible bastard” because that’s what I would say

12:33.591 --> 12:36.798
No, she definitely said “Off the hook”

12:36.843 --> 12:40.969
Man I am one tall, cute, lucky kid!

12:42.114 --> 12:45.028
So that’s it, man? Its like this thing with
You and Brooke never happened

12:45.483 --> 12:50.662
Yeah...well no, I mean,
there’s still gonna be a baby out there but...

12:50.668 --> 12:52.258
my life’s back to normal

12:53.668 --> 12:54.650
sort a

12:56.541 --> 13:00.445
I mean, it’s kinda weird but
I’m not gonna think about it ‘cause I don’t need to

13:00.663 --> 13:04.767
you know I should be happy right now.
You know, I am happy, right now!

13:05.392 --> 13:07.063
Yeah, I think

13:08.256 --> 13:14.518
Yeah, think, feel, look deep inside like deep,
deep inside almost to China

13:15.628 --> 13:17.223
There’s a good guy in there

13:17.223 --> 13:19.879
You know what?
Don’t lecture me, okay?

13:20.297 --> 13:24.895
I went to her and I tried to talk to her
and she said it was cool which is awesome

13:25.088 --> 13:27.807
because this could,
like, screw up my whole life!

13:28.213 --> 13:32.547
Yeah, man, you know you gotta stay focused
if your gonna invent those quadruple Oreo’s

13:35.497 --> 13:37.745
Those are a secret, man

13:38.345 --> 13:43.833
No yeah, this is good. Why put yourself out for some kid,
children grow up without dads all the time

13:44.278 --> 13:46.797
- Right
- Yeah, like Steven

13:46.996 --> 13:49.250
Well, I don’t want him ending up like Hyde

13:50.742 --> 13:54.120
hair all frizzed out with angry thoughts

13:57.989 --> 14:00.155
And violent, too

14:00.736 --> 14:05.681
Kelso, you know what you should do?
But your not gonna do it because your to much of a tool

14:05.791 --> 14:10.578
You know what?
It’s real easy to talk about the right thing to do when it’s not your life

14:11.800 --> 14:12.800
Tool

14:15.561 --> 14:19.200
Oh, Steven your sensitive to this because
your father ditched you, too

14:19.200 --> 14:20.900
That is so foxy

14:22.770 --> 14:27.828
Hey, why don’t we go down to my room, tell you about
the time my mom got so loaded on mouthwash,

14:27.944 --> 14:30.364
she lost our rent money at the track

14:31.937 --> 14:35.053
Okay, you two claim to be married and living here

14:35.465 --> 14:40.838
to verify this I’m going to separate you all
and ask you a series of questions about the couple.

14:40.962 --> 14:44.663
- Let me remind you your all under oath
- under oath?

14:45.471 --> 14:46.568
I mean...

14:48.639 --> 14:51.006
under Oath, bravo!

14:52.950 --> 14:57.423
Okay, first question, What kind of toothpaste does Fez use?

14:57.716 --> 15:02.138
Um, I brush my teeth with Colgate it is the only thing
that cuts through the, um, milk duds

15:02.863 --> 15:08.433
- Who the hell cares about toothpaste? This kid and my daughter are...
- Happy, happy, happy!

15:09.301 --> 15:11.698
I...wait, w-why am I under oath?

15:11.928 --> 15:16.319
cause if I say crest and the answer
is minty crest I Mean, that’s,

15:16.361 --> 15:18.877
like, uh, perjury, was-what’s gonna happen to me?

15:18.877 --> 15:20.437
wha-Oh, my god why are you writing this down?

15:21.903 --> 15:24.162
How long did Fez and Laurie date before they got married?

15:24.234 --> 15:28.421
Who needs to date? I had her in the sack
faster than you can say “Corn on The cob”..

15:30.115 --> 15:33.228
Speaking of dates, I made an incredible date nut bread

15:33.228 --> 15:40.809
The secret is to oak the dates in some good, strong rum,
which reminds me, who needs a drink?...I know I do.

15:41.468 --> 15:46.386
I don’t know how long they dated, I-oh,
my God, I’m going to prison aren’t I?

15:46.956 --> 15:48.571
I’m gonna get shanked

15:50.030 --> 15:52.132
What is Fez’s favorite T.V show?

15:52.132 --> 15:55.978
Uh, well, it depends.
Basically I just flip until I see nipples

15:57.813 --> 16:01.737
Sometimes I feel like a loaf of bread,

16:02.885 --> 16:08.586
everyone keeps taking a slice of me until
all that’s left are two crusty pieces that nobody wants

16:08.659 --> 16:12.410
and I just want to scream “Appreciate me, Damn it”
but I don’t, why?

16:12.675 --> 16:19.657
Because my mother always told me that nice girls shouldn’t
make a fuss and now I am a flippin’ doormat

16:21.454 --> 16:25.534
Okay look, man. Prison is not an option for me, okay?

16:27.267 --> 16:29.493
I can’t pee in front of other people

16:30.827 --> 16:37.676
Well...Despite a few interesting answers and one recipe

16:39.354 --> 16:42.067
My judgment is that your marriage...

16:42.567 --> 16:45.568
is legitimate. Congratulations!

16:46.323 --> 16:48.959
All right, Pepé and I are Americans

16:50.958 --> 16:54.334
No wonder this country is going in the toilet

16:54.932 --> 16:56.167
What was that, sir?

16:56.167 --> 17:01.170
Nothing, nothing he said he has to use the toilet,
that’s why he’s been so quiet

17:02.991 --> 17:07.324
If your trying to protect your daughter, don’t worry...
We never go after the bride

17:07.859 --> 17:10.112
especially such a pretty one

17:11.336 --> 17:14.336
If there was a crime committed,
we’d only be interested in this one,

17:14.508 --> 17:17.396
so if there’s something you want to say,
by all means, say it

17:17.692 --> 17:19.569
Fine, I will

17:27.483 --> 17:29.674
I just wanted to say...

17:31.620 --> 17:34.561
these two kids are married and...

17:35.705 --> 17:37.411
very much in love

17:38.161 --> 17:41.848
In fact, I’ve never seen a love like this

17:44.279 --> 17:46.701
Thank you, Mr. Red. It means a lot

17:47.654 --> 17:49.440
Hey, what about thanking me

17:50.288 --> 17:52.768
his guy tried to break me

17:54.049 --> 17:58.726
but lucky for you double-O Forman is rock solid

18:01.628 --> 18:03.993
Wow, you really are pregnant

18:05.397 --> 18:09.550
They make them really tiny now...quarter pound, my ass

18:12.306 --> 18:12.998
Hey!

18:14.490 --> 18:15.792
I need to talk to you

18:16.517 --> 18:19.963
Kelso, that’s great!
Here take my seat sit down

18:21.397 --> 18:22.665
I’ll just be right over there

18:24.414 --> 18:25.512
Good for you!

18:29.556 --> 18:35.908
All right...At first when you told me I was off the hook.
I was, like, totally psyched, right?

18:36.286 --> 18:39.204
But then I started to think about it and...

18:40.478 --> 18:47.548
- I don’t wanna be off the hook, I wanna be a part of this kids life
- Michael, I didn’t let you off the hook to be nice.

18:48.276 --> 18:51.196
I just don’t think you understand what
I means to have a baby

18:52.302 --> 18:55.045
No but I do...I means,

18:55.336 --> 19:01.510
taking him to teeball games, and teaching him how to ride a bike
and taking him to the doctor when he’s sick

19:01.833 --> 19:03.276
And what if it’s a girl?

19:03.353 --> 19:06.244
Uh, it’s not gonna be a girl we did it standing up!

19:10.053 --> 19:10.745
Uh-huh

19:12.131 --> 19:14.774
Okay, maybe this will change your mind

19:15.213 --> 19:20.577
I went and got some stuff today,
this...

19:20.966 --> 19:23.909
little sweater, to keep him warm

19:24.568 --> 19:29.603
and...this little hat, to keep the sun off of his face

19:29.661 --> 19:34.863
I got some pop rocks ‘cause
I always wanted to see a baby eat popRocks

19:36.874 --> 19:43.159
Michael, If you get involved,
I’m just gonna have two babies to take care of instead of one

19:43.745 --> 19:49.053
Look, you can try to get rid of me
but I’m not walkin’ away from this

19:51.158 --> 19:55.828
I’m sorry,
I just don’t want you to be the father of my child

20:07.539 --> 20:08.750
This is all your fault, yeah!

20:09.463 --> 20:15.056
- “ Go talk to her an-and-and do the right thing”
- Kelso, I’m so sorry,

20:17.239 --> 20:19.350
I wish there was something I could do

20:19.541 --> 20:20.524
Well, there isn’t

20:22.133 --> 20:23.344
Okay fine...

20:23.976 --> 20:27.043
I’ll give you ten seconds to squeeze my ass
as long as you want

20:37.489 --> 20:38.909
I never thought I’d say this...

20:39.491 --> 20:42.466
but there’s some things that a girls ass cant fix

20:48.632 --> 20:52.619
Well, Fez, congratulations on your green card,
but remember this is America

20:52.779 --> 20:56.042
and you still look foreign
so don’t expect to be treated equally

20:56.773 --> 20:59.978
Well, I’m going to become America’s sexiest singing cowboy

21:00.838 --> 21:03.871
Howdy ladies, meet Pepé!

21:04.627 --> 21:08.599
You know, what’s going on with Brooke really hurts
but I think in a couple days when I start to heel,

21:08.599 --> 21:13.511
I’m gonna be really psyched that Donna let me squeeze her ass.
I mean, even now I’m reflecting upon on how soft it was

21:14.663 --> 21:17.378
So, what kind of chance do you think I have with the blonde?

21:18.305 --> 21:24.481
