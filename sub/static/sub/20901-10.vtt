00:01.585 --> 00:03.792
(wind whistling )

00:07.549 --> 00:10.541
- ( exhales )
- ( infected snarling )

00:12.888 --> 00:15.846
( footsteps approaching )

00:15.891 --> 00:18.052
( snarling )

00:24.900 --> 00:26.231
( Chuckles )

00:26.276 --> 00:28.358
Ta-da!

00:28.403 --> 00:29.438
No?

00:30.781 --> 00:34.148
- Ta-da!
- ( shed creaking )

00:43.710 --> 00:46.702
You know, the hard part
is not the walk.

00:46.755 --> 00:49.337
It's the eyes.
Theyjust kind of...

00:49.383 --> 00:51.624
they don't look
at anything.

00:51.677 --> 00:56.467
Theyjust stare at the space
between atoms.

00:56.515 --> 00:59.723
- Water.
- Are you... you thirsty, killer?

01:01.270 --> 01:03.352
I'm not that.

01:03.397 --> 01:05.228
You're...
you're not what?

01:05.274 --> 01:06.684
You’re not thirsty?

01:06.733 --> 01:08.724
So, uh, was Otto
your first?

01:12.531 --> 01:14.317
I killed him to save us.

01:16.577 --> 01:19.114
Wow, you really think
you saved us?

01:20.872 --> 01:21.827
I saved you.

01:23.959 --> 01:26.496
Nah.

01:26.545 --> 01:28.206
I don't think so.

01:33.969 --> 01:35.925
(window clatters )

01:35.971 --> 01:38.838
( breathing heavily )

01:40.225 --> 01:42.136
Please open it.
There's no air.

01:43.687 --> 01:45.268
Who did you save?

01:45.314 --> 01:46.724
Please.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.684
(wind whistling )

01:48.734 --> 01:50.395
Oh, I'm only playing.

01:50.444 --> 01:51.775
I got the key.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.731
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.645
What's the password?

01:55.699 --> 01:57.235
Troy, I'm dying.

01:58.827 --> 02:00.692
(sighs )

02:03.332 --> 02:05.948
I owe you.

02:06.001 --> 02:08.743
- ( key jing/ing )
- ( clattering )

02:12.591 --> 02:14.252
( music playing )

02:18.472 --> 02:20.633
( bird caws )

02:20.682 --> 02:22.263
Come on.

02:23.769 --> 02:25.600
That's it.
Come on.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.144
Come on.

02:30.817 --> 02:33.433
( bird cawing )

02:36.531 --> 02:38.658
( breathing heavily )

02:38.700 --> 02:40.907
Troy's voice:
You’re so close to it.

02:42.829 --> 02:45.320
( music playing )

02:48.710 --> 02:50.246
Otto knew
this was happening?

02:50.295 --> 02:51.831
He was documenting it.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.336
A fraud to the end.

02:53.382 --> 02:55.418
Madison:
He had to have a plan B.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.589
No one can know
how bad this is.

02:59.638 --> 03:02.004
The peace
is too fragile.

03:02.057 --> 03:04.764
Maybe there's another
aquifer we can tap to.

03:04.810 --> 03:07.768
No, this is it.

03:07.813 --> 03:10.350
My scouts reported
a trading post.

03:10.399 --> 03:13.391
A couple days' drive
from here, near Mexicali.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.604
Hear you can get
almost anything.

03:15.654 --> 03:17.519
It's a lot to buy.

03:20.659 --> 03:22.274
Madison: We want to secure
a backup supply of water

03:22.327 --> 03:23.533
in case
it's a hot summer.

03:23.578 --> 03:24.863
We'll only be gone
a couple of days.

03:24.913 --> 03:27.655
In the interim, we impose
ranchwide rationing.

03:27.708 --> 03:30.871
We shut off all pumps, irrigation,
RV lines, and taps.

03:30.919 --> 03:32.500
Walker: Even the one
up at the adobe.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.036
So, everyone gets their water
from the main well?

03:34.089 --> 03:36.671
That's right.
Two gallons per person per day.

03:42.931 --> 03:45.968
We're releasing guns
to you and two deputies.

03:46.017 --> 03:47.302
Maintain the peace.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.771
( engine starts )

03:59.698 --> 04:01.814
He seems better.

04:04.828 --> 04:06.409
I'll watch Nick
while you're gone.

04:06.455 --> 04:08.320
Thank you.

04:08.373 --> 04:09.909
I know I ask
a lot of you, but...

04:09.958 --> 04:10.993
There's more.

04:14.045 --> 04:15.330
Tell me.

04:17.132 --> 04:20.374
There's only about
six weeks' worth of water left.

04:22.637 --> 04:23.797
The austerity
will help, right?

04:23.847 --> 04:25.462
That's with
the austerity.

04:25.515 --> 04:27.676
Alicia,
no one can know.

04:27.726 --> 04:30.763
If they do,
this all goes to hell.

04:30.812 --> 04:33.474
And if it does, you and
your brother need to get out.

04:33.523 --> 04:36.856
- (zipper unzips )
- Things go sideways, you need to be ready.

04:38.403 --> 04:39.939
( zipper zips )

04:39.988 --> 04:42.730
Come here.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.694
You've always been
the strong one.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.037
( footsteps receding )

04:54.085 --> 04:56.292
( insects and birds
chirping )

05:04.513 --> 05:05.798
Madison:
Here.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.132
Take it, baby.

05:07.182 --> 05:08.843
Come on.

05:08.892 --> 05:10.382
Take it.

05:10.435 --> 05:11.845
( canteen clattering )

05:14.648 --> 05:15.933
You get out soon.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.974
I gotta go away
for a couple of days.

05:19.027 --> 05:22.064
- ( wheezing ) I’m not leaving
until I know you’re okay.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.024
( Madison grunting )

05:27.077 --> 05:29.318
Oh.
(sighs )

05:31.206 --> 05:33.993
Oh, I'm so sorry.

05:35.544 --> 05:37.159
I love you.

05:37.212 --> 05:38.748
Nick?

05:42.551 --> 05:44.507
( music playing )

05:44.553 --> 05:46.418
( engine starts )

05:56.231 --> 05:58.017
(air hisses)

06:33.810 --> 06:36.142
Out.

06:36.187 --> 06:39.099
( breathing heavily )

06:43.862 --> 06:45.693
Here.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.070
(sighs )

06:55.040 --> 06:57.122
Don't guzzle it.
You'll puke it up.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.704
( distant chatter )

06:59.753 --> 07:02.495
( exhales )

07:02.547 --> 07:04.924
You messed up like Troy
or just another follower?

07:04.966 --> 07:06.706
Who do you think
talked him down?

07:12.307 --> 07:14.844
Get up.
Come on, sit up.

07:19.814 --> 07:22.271
I'm gonna keep
an eye on you.

07:22.317 --> 07:25.775
- You think wrong and I'll know about it.
( footsteps approaching )

07:31.034 --> 07:33.116
(Alicia grunts )

07:36.831 --> 07:38.492
( door opens )

07:57.686 --> 08:00.894
Hey, easy.
That's all you get.

08:00.939 --> 08:02.725
VVhy?

08:04.859 --> 08:06.690
They're rationing
ranchwide.

08:06.736 --> 08:08.647
Everything's shut off
but the main well.

08:08.697 --> 08:09.777
(jug thuds )

08:12.075 --> 08:15.784
- Didn't Mom tell you?
- Mm, it was hot.

08:18.373 --> 08:21.080
Well, she and Walker
have gone to find water.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.051
You okay?

08:36.224 --> 08:37.760
Salt your water.

08:42.981 --> 08:45.688
- Pat: It’s not enough, Jake.
- It's just for now. It's temporary.

08:45.734 --> 08:47.065
I'm twice the size
of anybody here.

08:47.110 --> 08:48.816
I piss two gallons
in the morning.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.853
We’re gonna get
the same amount of water?

08:50.905 --> 08:52.816
Jake: Two gallons
per person per day. That's standard.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.857
Pat: I don 't need to shower,
wash my damn clothes,

08:54.909 --> 08:58.072
but my horse needs ﬁve gallons,
not to mention the cattle.

08:58.121 --> 08:59.986
- Eight gallons, minimum.
- That's if they're dry.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.701
If they're milking cows,
they're gonna need twice as much.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.706
Did you all come here
to gang up on hm?

09:03.752 --> 09:06.038
Pat: We don 't like
being dictated to by outsiders.

09:06.087 --> 09:08.624
Oh, that's how you feel?

09:08.673 --> 09:10.834
There are the stairs.
Walk out.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.294
Walk to the gate
and keep going,

09:12.343 --> 09:13.958
you don't like
the circumstances,

09:14.012 --> 09:17.004
but I promise you
they're goddamn worse out there.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.388
(sighs )

09:18.433 --> 09:20.970
Everything
is gonna be fine.

09:21.019 --> 09:22.384
Jake has this.

09:22.437 --> 09:24.849
He lost his brother,
he lost his father

09:24.898 --> 09:27.890
to make sure you weren't
kicked out or killed.

09:27.942 --> 09:30.684
Trust that.
Trust him.

09:36.785 --> 09:37.991
Yeah.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.121
- We're good.
- Good. All right.

09:44.167 --> 09:45.657
- Right?
- Yeah.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.701
We'll make it work.
We'll make it work.

09:50.048 --> 09:52.255
Madison: Alicia, are you there?
Over.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.258
- Alicia: Mom.
- Hey, is Nick out?

09:58.056 --> 10:02.049
Uh, yeah.
He ’s dehydrated but okay.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.935
- How's the ranch taking it?
- They’re pissed.

10:04.979 --> 10:09.769
People are suspicious
and paranoid.

10:09.818 --> 10:12.150
If we... if we don't ﬁnd anything
tomorrow, we ’re turning around.

10:12.195 --> 10:13.935
No, don't.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.188
Everything will
be fine. Um...

10:18.743 --> 10:20.950
|'|| reach out
if there's a crisis.

10:20.995 --> 10:22.906
Okay. I'll call you
this time tomorrow.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.287
Okay.
- Bye.

10:24.332 --> 10:26.072
- Bye.
( static crack/es )

10:37.512 --> 10:39.798
You stand between
your children and the sun.

10:39.848 --> 10:41.384
Excuse me?

10:41.432 --> 10:43.923
I bet you even apologized
to your son for his punishment.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.763
Do you have kids?

10:46.855 --> 10:48.345
l have three
beautiful dogs.

10:48.398 --> 10:50.730
Talk to me
when you have children.

10:55.363 --> 10:58.070
Bruce, one of my dogs...
dead now...

10:58.116 --> 11:00.323
got into a fight
with a big dog.

11:02.287 --> 11:04.403
I stuck my hand in
to save him.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.330
And Bruce bit me.

11:08.877 --> 11:10.913
Only time he ever did.

11:12.547 --> 11:14.333
Wow.

11:14.382 --> 11:16.498
| see things in
a whole new light now.

11:16.551 --> 11:18.087
Thanks for that.

11:26.561 --> 11:29.519
( door squeaks open )

11:29.564 --> 11:32.021
( footsteps approaching )

11:38.323 --> 11:40.860
Whoa!
Easy, Nick.

11:40.909 --> 11:43.525
Easy.
( panting )

11:43.578 --> 11:45.284
We're not here
to hurt you.

11:58.593 --> 11:59.924
What do you want?

11:59.969 --> 12:01.129
To say thank you.

12:02.597 --> 12:03.882
Blake: We were ready
to roll over,

12:03.932 --> 12:06.014
and then you and Troy
sacked up.

12:07.602 --> 12:10.560
They may not
say it out there,

12:10.605 --> 12:13.312
but what you did in here
meant a lot.

12:15.944 --> 12:17.900
You're welcome.

12:17.946 --> 12:22.030
Everyone thinks the militia's
dead now that Troy left,

12:22.075 --> 12:23.565
but it's not.

12:23.618 --> 12:26.485
We're ready to fight
if you are.

12:33.127 --> 12:35.163
( sniffs )

12:37.632 --> 12:40.374
Mm.

12:40.426 --> 12:45.170
Well, look, we need guns
we don't have.

12:45.223 --> 12:48.181
I think it's best
we keep a low profile.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.434
Thought you'd say
something like that.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.311
Brought you a gift.

13:01.239 --> 13:03.855
This is the last
free gun on the ranch.

13:03.908 --> 13:06.024
If anyone deserves this,
it's you.

13:09.914 --> 13:11.324
Rest.

13:12.500 --> 13:15.116
We'll talk more
manana.

13:15.169 --> 13:17.911
( music playing )

13:29.976 --> 13:31.591
( chatter )

13:44.699 --> 13:46.655
Here, drink this.

13:46.701 --> 13:48.111
( cup thuds )

13:48.161 --> 13:49.822
Woman:
It's okay, honey.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.584
- Shit.
- What?

14:01.632 --> 14:03.372
She came through once
this morning.

14:03.426 --> 14:06.509
- They're double-dipping.
- You positive?

14:06.554 --> 14:08.135
I know what I saw.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.263
We gotta
do something.

14:24.739 --> 14:26.525
Should we
offer them water?

14:30.244 --> 14:32.109
I think we might
offend our hosts.

14:36.626 --> 14:39.117
( music playing )

15:02.151 --> 15:04.563
(radio chatter) - Man over P.A.: Make your
way to the vendor entrance

15:04.612 --> 15:06.728
to receive credentials.

15:06.781 --> 15:08.612
All weapons must be surrendered...
- Xie‘ xie.

15:08.658 --> 15:10.569
...at the secure
checkpoint.

15:10.618 --> 15:13.735
- (guard speaking Spanish )
- Uh, inglés, por favor.

15:13.788 --> 15:15.574
Surrender
your weapons, slow.

15:19.293 --> 15:22.501
Welcome to the bazaar,
safe market in unsafe times.

15:22.547 --> 15:24.754
- How do we buy water?
- Trade for it inside

15:24.799 --> 15:26.585
if you can cover
the price of admission.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.340
What do you have
to exchange?

15:32.515 --> 15:35.348
That an LQ-101
long distance radio?

15:35.393 --> 15:37.634
- Uh, it's not for trade.
- Buy you two days inside.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.688
Alicia,
are you there? Over.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.366
129 credits.

15:58.416 --> 16:01.658
Less parking, entrance,
and security fees.

16:01.711 --> 16:03.121
Enjoy.

16:03.171 --> 16:05.127
( chatter)

16:05.173 --> 16:07.255
( music playing )

16:09.844 --> 16:12.130
- ( chatter)
- (vendors shouting )

16:12.180 --> 16:15.217
( men singing in Spanish
over speakers )

16:30.198 --> 16:33.156
( music continues )
( man shouting in Spanish )

16:35.536 --> 16:38.243
( shouting continues )

16:43.211 --> 16:45.293
- ( bell ringing)
- ( man speaking Spanish ) Only 320.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.545
No way! No!

16:47.590 --> 16:49.296
( speaking Spanish )

16:49.342 --> 16:50.832
(continues in Spanish )

16:50.885 --> 16:53.342
( people shouting
in Spanish )

16:55.348 --> 16:57.680
( man #2 speaking Spanish )

16:57.725 --> 16:59.431
...where the men
and ladies don't bite...

16:59.477 --> 17:00.842
unless you want us to.

17:00.895 --> 17:02.510
You know what I mean?

17:02.563 --> 17:04.474
( needle buzzing )

17:10.238 --> 17:12.274
( music continues )

17:14.742 --> 17:16.607
( insects chirping )

17:23.417 --> 17:24.873
You the bodyguard?

17:24.919 --> 17:26.705
Maybe.

17:26.754 --> 17:28.665
Who's watching out
for you?

17:28.714 --> 17:30.625
( footsteps approaching )

17:35.596 --> 17:36.711
You wanna come in?

17:39.809 --> 17:42.596
I wanna get ahead
of something.

17:42.645 --> 17:45.557
I heard
some of your people

17:45.606 --> 17:47.471
went through
the water line twice.

17:47.525 --> 17:50.232
I heard we let you
stay on our land,

17:50.278 --> 17:51.688
that you're lucky
to be alive.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.523
I'm just trying
to keep the peace.

17:54.865 --> 17:56.150
What Walker wanted.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.906
( chuckles )

17:57.952 --> 18:00.409
Crazy Dog: She hiked up here
in her little boots

18:00.454 --> 18:02.240
to remind us
what Walker wants.

18:02.290 --> 18:03.905
Do you have proof?

18:03.958 --> 18:05.914
Names?

18:05.960 --> 18:08.667
I think we should impose
some kind of system

18:08.713 --> 18:11.125
- to make sure people aren't
going through twice.

18:11.299 --> 18:12.505
We have one, Alicia.

18:12.550 --> 18:14.256
| oversaw
the exchange myself.

18:14.302 --> 18:16.384
Nobody from the Nation
went through twice.

18:20.349 --> 18:22.601
Easy mistake to make.

18:22.643 --> 18:25.430
- We all look the same to you.
- That's not what this is about.

18:27.356 --> 18:29.392
I don't want things
to boil over.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.808
- I heard your militia's rebuilding.
- There is no militia.

18:31.861 --> 18:33.772
You killed it.

18:40.328 --> 18:42.284
If you really
want peace,

18:42.330 --> 18:44.116
control your own
people first.

18:57.511 --> 18:58.967
Blake: lt'sjust
a matter of time

18:59.013 --> 19:01.470
before the Nation
slaughters us in our sleep.

19:01.515 --> 19:04.757
- We need to fight.
- We need to finish what Troy started.

19:04.810 --> 19:08.473
- Take back what's ours.
- Coop, they have the guns.

19:08.522 --> 19:11.434
- And they haven't hurt us.
- Yet.

19:11.484 --> 19:14.647
You know, first the land,
then the guns, now they're double-dipping.

19:14.695 --> 19:17.983
You don't gotta be a damn genius
to see how this is trending.

19:18.032 --> 19:20.444
You, you're the one that
stood up with Troy, right?

19:20.493 --> 19:22.449
All I'm saying
is if we attack first,

19:22.495 --> 19:23.735
we're gonna end up
just like Troy, okay?

19:23.788 --> 19:25.619
He moved too soon.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.326
That's why he's out there
and we're in here.

19:27.375 --> 19:29.331
No one is saying
give up,

19:29.377 --> 19:30.492
but we do need to wait.

19:30.544 --> 19:31.499
Coop:
How long?

19:32.880 --> 19:34.336
- What's the threshold?
- We're at it.

19:34.382 --> 19:35.622
If they take
anything else,

19:35.675 --> 19:37.836
then we need to be
ready to stop them.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.604
( sniffs )

19:56.737 --> 19:59.524
You asshole.

19:59.573 --> 20:01.859
I thought we were trying
to prevent this from happening.

20:01.909 --> 20:03.774
If I have it, it means
they can't use it.

20:03.828 --> 20:05.614
And what if
Crazy Dog finds it?!

20:05.663 --> 20:07.745
It's not gonna be
the hot box again, Nick.

20:07.790 --> 20:10.873
Look, they're just backed
into a corner, you know?

20:10.918 --> 20:12.624
Scared.

20:12.670 --> 20:14.035
Enough to get
themselves killed,

20:14.088 --> 20:17.751
and they think
that I'm this hero

20:17.800 --> 20:20.667
who stood up
against the Indians.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.676
And you like
that they think that?

20:24.473 --> 20:26.054
No.

20:26.100 --> 20:28.056
But they're
listening to me.

20:28.102 --> 20:30.935
They're only listening to you
because they don't know the truth.

20:30.980 --> 20:33.767
What happens when they
find out what you and Mom did?

20:36.777 --> 20:39.644
The second she called
Otto's death a suicide...

20:41.449 --> 20:42.655
I knew.

20:45.119 --> 20:47.576
Was it Mom?

20:51.459 --> 20:52.790
( sniffs )

20:59.633 --> 21:02.966
l was upset I wasn't a part of it.
How shitty is that?

21:07.892 --> 21:10.008
But then
I felt relieved...

21:12.646 --> 21:15.854
because what a burden it is
being Mom's favorite.

21:20.029 --> 21:21.735
- I didn't do it for her.
- No?

21:21.781 --> 21:23.442
Then who did
you do it for?

21:23.491 --> 21:24.901
If you didn't
do it for her,

21:24.950 --> 21:26.611
then you did it for the ranch,
for these people,

21:26.660 --> 21:28.696
and you're not
that kind of person.

21:34.168 --> 21:35.908
Look at what
killing got us, Nick.

21:35.961 --> 21:38.293
Look at what
it's done to you.

21:40.508 --> 21:42.874
We're alive.

21:47.681 --> 21:49.967
We keep trying
to make her love us.

21:54.688 --> 21:56.064
She's broken.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.155
( music playing )

22:14.208 --> 22:17.951
( radio static crackling )

22:18.003 --> 22:20.380
Mom. Over.

22:25.719 --> 22:28.756
( sighs )
Mom, you there?

22:28.806 --> 22:30.342
Over.

22:38.232 --> 22:40.894
(quietly) I don't wanna be
the strong one anymore.

22:48.784 --> 22:51.116
- ( music playing on stereo )
- (speaking Chinese )

22:51.161 --> 22:52.947
(speaking Spanish )

22:55.624 --> 22:58.001
Are you Maria Lu?

22:58.043 --> 23:01.581
- (speaking Spanish )
- We hear you can get water.

23:01.630 --> 23:04.588
- How thirsty are you?
- 10,000 gallons thirsty.

23:05.759 --> 23:07.499
( scoffs )
No one has that.

23:08.762 --> 23:11.014
I can scrape
together half.

23:11.056 --> 23:13.217
It'll be all I got.

23:13.267 --> 23:14.632
What do you have
to offer?

23:28.866 --> 23:30.822
Oh, hoo, hoo!

23:32.620 --> 23:36.704
But this, my friend,
not enough.

23:36.749 --> 23:37.955
There's a dozen more
where that came from.

23:42.963 --> 23:46.706
(speaking Chinese )

23:46.759 --> 23:48.966
- I think we can work something out.
- Man: Hey! All right!

23:49.011 --> 23:50.922
- Maria: How soon would you like me...
- I can fix this!

23:50.971 --> 23:52.586
...to get you the precious water?
- Get off of me!

23:52.640 --> 23:54.005
You tell me...

23:55.309 --> 23:58.096
(grunts)

23:58.145 --> 24:00.010
- Holy shit, Victor.
- Ow!

24:00.064 --> 24:01.725
- What did he do?
- Madison, stop.

24:01.774 --> 24:02.889
Whatever he broke,
I can fix it.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.603
Madison, please,
they'll hurt you.

24:04.652 --> 24:05.858
If you two
are in the wrong

24:05.903 --> 24:07.734
with Proctor John,
no deal.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.771
I like my skull
where it is, thank you.

24:09.823 --> 24:12.986
- Proctor who?
- (speaking Chinese )

24:13.035 --> 24:14.991
( music playing )

24:21.043 --> 24:22.874
(grunting )

24:27.675 --> 24:30.508
(gasping )

24:32.846 --> 24:34.632
Come on.
Come on, come!

24:34.682 --> 24:36.638
( music playing )

24:44.358 --> 24:46.019
Got a safe place
for us.

24:47.111 --> 24:49.022
Victor:
Go. Go.

24:55.619 --> 24:59.703
(sighing )

25:02.376 --> 25:04.958
- It's supplies.
- You were making a deal with Maria Lu,

25:05.004 --> 25:06.210
- so I know it's something shiny.
- Stop deflecting!

25:06.255 --> 25:07.791
Why are they trying
to kill you?

25:07.840 --> 25:09.831
- It's not our concern.
- Answer me, Victor.

25:11.844 --> 25:13.835
He's in debt to
the ruler of this place.

25:13.887 --> 25:15.923
Who is this handsome man
you're traveling with?

25:15.973 --> 25:19.682
- Qaletaqa Walker.
- Victor Strand. Pleasure.

25:19.727 --> 25:21.934
We should leave now.

25:21.979 --> 25:24.140
All right, we just need to get back
to the truck and we can get out of here.

25:24.189 --> 25:27.022
Unfortunately, no one leaves
until their debts are paid.

25:27.067 --> 25:28.648
Walker:
We have no debt.

25:30.863 --> 25:31.943
(sighs )

25:31.989 --> 25:33.775
You're trapped here.

25:35.325 --> 25:38.158
I made one rash, stupid
decision that compromised me,

25:38.203 --> 25:41.070
but I will overcome it,
as I do.

25:41.123 --> 25:43.159
Was this your big plan
when you refused to leave the hotel?

25:43.208 --> 25:45.745
No. | reconnected
with an old friend.

25:45.794 --> 25:47.375
He controls a dam
near Tijuana.

25:47.421 --> 25:49.286
He wasn't as fond of me
as l was of him.

25:49.339 --> 25:51.716
- A dam?
- You don't wanna go there.

25:51.759 --> 25:53.590
Do they wanna
kill you, too?

25:56.430 --> 25:59.092
People either love me
or hate me, Mr. Walker.

25:59.141 --> 26:00.847
Never indifference.

26:00.893 --> 26:03.384
But there's a good
damn reason why I'm still here.

26:03.437 --> 26:04.722
That's a yes.

26:04.772 --> 26:07.388
All right,
we just need to rest.

26:07.441 --> 26:09.727
Come on, we'll find our way
through this tomorrow.

26:09.777 --> 26:13.065
- Fine.
- ( chuckles ) Fine.

26:13.113 --> 26:14.819
But the bed is mine.

26:17.076 --> 26:19.158
( music playing )

26:19.203 --> 26:23.116
- Alicia: It's not a lot, but...
- She was sick last week.

26:23.165 --> 26:24.996
It's kind of
impossible.

26:29.797 --> 26:30.877
Put it back.

26:34.468 --> 26:36.675
What are you gonna do,
turn me over to the Nation?

26:36.720 --> 26:37.675
Now.

26:37.805 --> 26:39.591
You know
they're doing it, too.

26:41.183 --> 26:42.798
Hey, stop!
What are you doing?

26:42.851 --> 26:44.102
- You're taking twice your share.
- Stop!

26:44.144 --> 26:46.305
- She took my water!
- Stop. Let go!

26:46.355 --> 26:48.141
- It's stealing.
- Let go.

26:48.190 --> 26:50.431
- You're taking twice you share.
- She's a damn cooperator!

26:50.484 --> 26:53.146
Okay, okay, okay.

26:53.195 --> 26:55.231
You care more about them
than you do about us.

26:55.280 --> 26:57.236
- There is no them and us!
- Then you're an idiot!

26:57.282 --> 26:58.943
- Man: You're a thief!
- You're a theif!

26:58.992 --> 27:01.449
- (voices overlapping )
- Get back with your people!

27:01.495 --> 27:03.201
Just please stop.

27:03.247 --> 27:05.863
- We don't have water!
- Enough. Listen to me!

27:11.088 --> 27:13.795
We only have
six weeks of water left.

27:13.841 --> 27:15.172
Man: What do you mean,
six weeks?

27:15.217 --> 27:16.707
What are you
talking about?

27:16.760 --> 27:18.375
(people murmuring )

27:18.428 --> 27:20.384
If we don't
work together,

27:20.430 --> 27:23.797
we will run out
and we will die.

27:23.851 --> 27:25.216
It is that simple.

27:26.979 --> 27:30.312
So please... stop.

27:32.151 --> 27:34.483
- ( all murmuring)
- Man #2: How's that happening?

27:34.528 --> 27:37.315
You should've said
something sooner.

27:37.364 --> 27:39.650
- Hey!
- ( all shouting )

27:49.376 --> 27:51.116
Back away from the well!

27:53.130 --> 27:56.247
We ’re taking it to make sure
everyone gets what they need.

28:00.137 --> 28:02.093
(all murmuring)

28:04.224 --> 28:06.135
Thank you very much.

28:08.562 --> 28:10.803
( music playing )

28:22.326 --> 28:25.193
- Move aside, Nick.
- You're not taking the well.

28:25.245 --> 28:27.452
Stick to your half of the ranch,
we stick to ours.

28:27.497 --> 28:29.988
The water's here, Nick.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.452
We're not walking
away from it.

28:31.501 --> 28:33.457
There's a pump
on your side.

28:33.503 --> 28:34.913
No.

29:15.337 --> 29:16.873
Not now.

29:27.099 --> 29:29.181
I'll keep the peace.

29:29.226 --> 29:30.932
Not at all costs.

29:32.104 --> 29:33.514
You got that?

29:54.001 --> 29:56.959
Blake: The whole ranch
is on the same water table.

29:57.004 --> 29:58.960
We have to get as much out
as we can before them.

29:59.006 --> 30:01.247
(sighs )

30:01.300 --> 30:03.461
( chatter )

30:09.308 --> 30:10.548
(speaking Spanish )

30:16.023 --> 30:19.231
You better have
something good to trade.

30:19.276 --> 30:21.392
( water pouring )

30:23.572 --> 30:26.109
- ( faucet hand/e squeaks )
- ( grunts )

30:26.158 --> 30:27.238
Where's Taqa?

30:27.284 --> 30:31.243
Uh, yo no sé.

30:31.288 --> 30:32.653
Taqa's not a talker.

30:32.706 --> 30:34.537
( distant chatter )

30:43.717 --> 30:45.582
(sighs )

30:45.635 --> 30:48.547
(grunting )

30:53.727 --> 30:55.183
You trust him?

30:56.730 --> 30:59.096
We want and need
the same thing.

31:06.073 --> 31:07.404
Did you find Nick?

31:12.120 --> 31:13.951
We did, yes.

31:19.086 --> 31:21.077
Alicia?

31:21.129 --> 31:22.414
North.

31:23.757 --> 31:26.123
Safe on the ranch
with her brother.

31:29.638 --> 31:31.629
My children
are alive.

31:44.111 --> 31:45.226
Come here.

31:55.789 --> 31:58.075
You found Nick,

31:58.125 --> 31:59.581
lost Travis.

32:02.295 --> 32:04.456
God's a feckless thug.

32:09.136 --> 32:11.377
God had
no hand in it.

32:11.430 --> 32:12.966
(sighs )

32:21.398 --> 32:23.605
( footsteps approaching )

32:23.650 --> 32:24.935
( gate opens )

32:26.820 --> 32:28.481
They said they'd kill
every one of us.

32:37.080 --> 32:39.241
No.

32:39.291 --> 32:42.078
- Man: It's okay.
- What are you gonna do to my friend?

32:43.462 --> 32:45.544
He's gotta work off
what he owes to Proctor.

32:45.589 --> 32:48.626
- Let me talk to the proctor.
- (scoffs ) No.

32:48.675 --> 32:50.381
No one does that.

32:52.554 --> 32:55.512
When you say "work off," you don't
mean cleaning dishes, do you?

32:55.557 --> 32:58.390
Labor commensurate
with the debt.

32:58.435 --> 33:00.642
You saw it
on the way in.

33:00.687 --> 33:04.145
- The people chained to the fence?
- Just till the debt's paid.

33:19.581 --> 33:22.823
Go back to your children,
Madison. You're wasting time here.

33:22.876 --> 33:24.662
I'm saving them,
Victor.

33:24.711 --> 33:27.498
This is everywhere.

33:27.547 --> 33:31.290
It's not state,
not country, not continent.

33:31.343 --> 33:33.299
It does not
see borders.

33:34.888 --> 33:37.846
The whole world
is lost.

33:37.891 --> 33:39.722
- Okay?
- I found you, though.

33:39.768 --> 33:42.555
(sighs )

33:43.730 --> 33:45.846
My mother
named me Victor

33:45.899 --> 33:48.606
because she knew
I'd always win.

33:52.280 --> 33:53.565
( kisses )

33:53.615 --> 33:56.106
- I'll be fine.
(door opens)

33:58.245 --> 33:59.655
(grunts)

33:59.704 --> 34:01.205
( radio chatter)

34:01.248 --> 34:03.864
Don't worry your
pretty blonde head.

34:03.917 --> 34:05.578
( chuckles )

34:10.382 --> 34:12.338
( gate closes,
lock clicks )

34:13.718 --> 34:15.629
( music playing )

34:18.765 --> 34:21.723
( chatter )

34:21.768 --> 34:23.304
Thank you.

35:13.653 --> 35:16.315
- ( chatter )
- ( music playing )

35:16.364 --> 35:19.697
( footsteps approaching )

35:22.996 --> 35:25.658
| repaired
the water deal.

35:25.707 --> 35:27.663
She'll have it
at first light.

35:35.258 --> 35:37.544
Think about what the water
will mean for our people...

35:38.762 --> 35:40.298
your children.

35:52.776 --> 35:56.689
Blake: If we reposition all the RVs
into a circle, we can make a wall.

35:56.738 --> 35:58.694
Nick:
Don't... don't move the RVs.

35:58.740 --> 36:00.321
But it’ll give us
a better chance.

36:00.367 --> 36:02.858
In a battle
we'll still lose.

36:02.911 --> 36:04.993
We're making
spears, man.

36:05.038 --> 36:09.327
Coop: David bested Goliath
with a sling.

36:09.376 --> 36:11.662
Goliath
didn't have AKs.

36:11.711 --> 36:12.917
They do.

36:12.962 --> 36:15.419
We're outmatched.
They know it.

36:17.425 --> 36:19.256
Blake:
You don 't wanna fortify?

36:19.302 --> 36:21.008
It's wasted energy.

36:21.054 --> 36:24.592
So we attack
first, then.

36:24.641 --> 36:26.006
That where
your head's at?

36:26.059 --> 36:28.801
Look, if we can
get their guns,

36:28.853 --> 36:31.469
then this
back-and—forth,

36:31.523 --> 36:34.856
eye-for—an-eye
bullshit ends.

36:36.653 --> 36:40.441
Disarm them,
then there's no blood.

36:42.575 --> 36:44.440
Or there's
a lot of blood.

36:52.085 --> 36:54.667
( music playing )

36:54.713 --> 36:57.204
( infected snarling )

37:05.432 --> 37:06.797
(gunshot)

37:43.928 --> 37:45.839
( music playing )

37:48.475 --> 37:50.511
( infected snarling )

37:56.900 --> 37:58.936
( music playing )

37:58.985 --> 38:01.021
( distant chatter )

38:12.624 --> 38:14.706
( infected snarling )

38:36.022 --> 38:37.307
( panting )

38:38.525 --> 38:42.143
(gunfire)

38:42.195 --> 38:43.401
( bodies thud)

38:46.032 --> 38:48.318
- Hey.
- Let's go.

38:51.704 --> 38:53.615
(grunts)

38:53.665 --> 38:55.371
Your debt is paid.

39:02.715 --> 39:04.000
Madison:
Watch your step.

39:04.050 --> 39:05.506
All the way.

39:05.552 --> 39:07.463
( music playing )

39:09.931 --> 39:13.515
- You killed everyone at the ranch for this
waste! - No, Taqa, I saved us.

39:13.560 --> 39:15.892
The tanker was a short-term solve
for a long-term problem.

39:15.937 --> 39:17.427
It wouldn't get us
through the summer.

39:17.480 --> 39:19.471
Victor here, he's got
a permanent solution.

39:20.692 --> 39:21.772
I do?

39:21.818 --> 39:23.103
You're gonna take us
to this dam,

39:23.152 --> 39:25.017
get us all the water
we need.

39:25.071 --> 39:26.652
A permanent solution.

39:34.622 --> 39:36.578
( music playing )

40:05.612 --> 40:07.728
God damn it.

40:07.780 --> 40:09.395
Get her out of there.

40:15.747 --> 40:16.987
(grunts)

40:24.797 --> 40:26.173
I could talk to them.

40:26.215 --> 40:28.752
No more talking.

40:28.801 --> 40:31.838
I won't draw first blood,
but if they attack,

40:31.888 --> 40:33.173
Taqa will understand.

40:39.020 --> 40:41.636
Blake: The water table’s tapped.
It’s useless.

40:41.689 --> 40:44.180
- What is she doing?
- She's trying to save us.

41:10.677 --> 41:12.133
They're not gonna
find anything.

41:13.846 --> 41:15.177
Hey.

41:17.350 --> 41:19.716
( music playing )

41:37.370 --> 41:39.531
( footsteps )

41:57.390 --> 41:58.755
(grunts)

42:36.763 --> 42:39.095
( music playing )

42:51.903 --> 42:54.770
( music playing )
